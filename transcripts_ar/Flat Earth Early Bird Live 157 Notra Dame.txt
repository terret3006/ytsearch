[Music]

41.47 --> 50.32
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

45.38 --> 56.690000000000005

hangout link in public so good day to

95.03 --> 108.7
you all the weather today super nice

102.47 --> 114.5
warm bit chemtrail ido but seem worse

108.7 --> 120.399
warm sunny not too windy it's yeah a

114.5 --> 125.39
really nice spring day on the other hand

120.399 --> 131.44
not so nice so yeah yesterday apparently

125.39 --> 134.569
did not read am burn down and that sucks

131.44 --> 134.569
[Music]

136.9 --> 148.25
yeah I got a lot of dark world

141.46 --> 151.28
reflections on that and I think I even

148.25 --> 153.74
remembered asking like is there no way

151.28 --> 162.89
to stop this to prevent this from

153.74 --> 166.19
happening but no and I got ya back of

162.89 --> 169.67
the mind conspiracy theories about that

166.19 --> 173.0
that are very ethereal but the first

169.67 --> 178.77999999999997
thing I get out of it is that yep it's

173.0 --> 183.83
not it doesn't seem to be on purpose

178.78 --> 186.32
although yeah they're proof anyone in

183.83 --> 188.39000000000001
the situation it is highly suspect of

186.32 --> 191.93
course but every almost everything

188.39 --> 196.30999999999997
becomes highly suspect and any Christian

191.93 --> 198.769
Church burning down yeah we'll we'll

196.31 --> 204.56
make a lot of people immediately point

198.769 --> 208.13
fingers so but I don't think it is that

204.56 --> 210.17000000000002
in that case now let me get into the

208.13 --> 215.15
wild conspiracy theory and this is

210.17 --> 219.70899999999997
really out there but still there may be

215.15 --> 222.26000000000002
something to it so what if the ones that

219.709 --> 225.35
build it right weren't wasn't that

222.26 --> 231.35
during that the Templar age as it were

225.35 --> 234.519
so maybe they're from what I remember

231.35 --> 238.42
the natural dam was built

234.519 --> 238.42000000000002
extraordinarily quickly

239.76 --> 249.22
like insanely quickly and it's kind of

243.61 --> 254.16000000000003
unclear how so my idea is that maybe the

249.22 --> 258.43
Templars actually called upon Lucifer or

254.16 --> 262.81
some other ancient entity to use magic

258.43 --> 270.64
and [ __ ] - yeah to help build it or they

262.81 --> 273.07
use tartarean tools and that had maybe

270.64 --> 275.44
now we can get into the technical part

273.07 --> 277.09
of it okay you have one way to explain

275.44 --> 281.59
it and that that is in the ethereal way

277.09 --> 284.73999999999995
like Lucifer helped and thus those for

281.59 --> 287.02
always takes what he gives so at some

284.74 --> 290.74
point it would be doomed to be destroyed

287.02 --> 293.14
somehow that's very ethereal right so

290.74 --> 293.56
now we're gonna go into technical angle

293.14 --> 297.46
of it

293.56 --> 300.76
so if antiquity was used very

297.46 --> 305.90999999999997
extensively then that may bring certain

300.76 --> 309.19
inherent flaws especially when hasted

305.91 --> 314.91
that may be like some kind of in

309.19 --> 314.91
chemical instabilities I don't know

316.97 --> 324.76000000000005
or maybe it was just electromagnetically

319.31 --> 328.25
induced somehow it is a unique design

324.76 --> 330.8
anyway it was completely out there but I

328.25 --> 335.75
don't think it is was basically lit by

330.8 --> 340.15000000000003
anyone and also by the way I've been

335.75 --> 340.15
thinking about ya the aftermath of it

342.97 --> 349.19000000000005
from what I've seen what is left of it

346.21 --> 351.38
there's still quite a lot of it about

349.19 --> 355.1
it's basically the roof that's all burnt

351.38 --> 358.46
out which is terrible but I don't know

355.1 --> 361.31
maybe I wonder if the natura dom has

358.46 --> 365.69
been scanned for example because if you

361.31 --> 369.05
do that then well with the proper

365.69 --> 374.11
funding you could base it basically 3d

369.05 --> 379.04
prints much of the more complicated

374.11 --> 382.64
details and yeah rather quickly rebuild

379.04 --> 386.99
the rest of it just think about for

382.64 --> 390.02
example the Sagrada família now that

386.99 --> 393.11
church was built that's being built in

390.02 --> 396.919
Barcelona and they started I think in

393.11 --> 400.52000000000004
the 19th century it was incredible long

396.919 --> 402.62
work very tedious but then in the 20th

400.52 --> 405.56
century yeah they improved upon the

402.62 --> 408.7
techniques and used other types of

405.56 --> 412.43
approaches and made some progress and

408.7 --> 417.8
that even hastened up in the 21st

412.43 --> 423.2
century I've seen it progress gradually

417.8 --> 426.44
like in the in the 90s and just past the

423.2 --> 429.59
millennia it was great progress very

426.44 --> 432.71
hastily so if they can build that

429.59 --> 435.14
efficiently and quickly now then maybe

432.71 --> 436.90999999999997
technically the natural dam could be

435.14 --> 440.419
restored it's going to be a freaking

436.91 --> 443.63000000000005
expensive project to say the least but

440.419 --> 445.789
I'm just saying yeah if it is scanned

443.63 --> 447.63
and Cluff for photos all over the place

445.789 --> 451.31
so details enough it could

447.63 --> 453.78
technically be remade it's all a matter

451.31 --> 458.78000000000003
if that's going to be made a priority

453.78 --> 463.26
somehow so yeah that's my angle on that

458.78 --> 465.35999999999996
but it is yeah it was pretty gruesome to

463.26 --> 470.15
see that happen I was pretty shocked by

465.36 --> 470.15000000000003
it was all over the news everywhere

484.569 --> 492.639
all right Oh rune Thorson you may have a

489.58 --> 497.02
point there but to me I think that

492.639 --> 501.249
beautiful grand buildings have a

497.02 --> 503.349
cultural effect and yeah even if they

501.249 --> 505.629
cost maintenance and even if they're

503.349 --> 512.319
scammed with yeah it's up to the people

505.629 --> 517.649
but and look it's the 21st century

512.319 --> 520.56
robotics everything so technically they

517.649 --> 523.209
would always have been able to do that

520.56 --> 525.67
but now we are coming to an age where

523.209 --> 529.41
everything is becoming way more quick

525.67 --> 533.829
easy to design to make and eventually

529.41 --> 536.62
could do it ourselves or with a group

533.829 --> 540.2199999999999
like a crowdfunding thing you know don't

536.62 --> 543.99
underestimate the power of the people in

540.22 --> 543.99
this age with the current technologies

546.12 --> 553.18
you know could be made public and then

549.819 --> 557.1999999999999
it's like okay right it's the public's

553.18 --> 560.3199999999999
now no more screwing around with it

557.2 --> 560.32
[Music]

567.75 --> 572.75
Yeah right Rambo Jambo it's true but

573.379 --> 583.889
it's like churches are being built

577.79 --> 588.0889999999999
they're much smaller and cathedrals it's

583.889 --> 592.589
just too big and expensive and not so

588.089 --> 594.4200000000001
functional for this space it's going to

592.589 --> 596.9590000000001
take up and that's why they don't build

594.42 --> 596.959
new ones

601.99 --> 611.39
although you know what technically you

607.22 --> 613.7900000000001
could make cathedrals and design them in

611.39 --> 616.0699999999999
a way that they can accommodate for a

613.79 --> 619.9699999999999
lot of people and have like dual

616.07 --> 623.2900000000001
functions and everything like half opera

619.97 --> 629.9
house almost something like that and

623.29 --> 632.38
yeah you could give it a multi family

629.9 --> 641.7099999999999
function like okay it can serve as a

632.38 --> 641.71
performance location or for lectures or

644.92 --> 651.91
to accommodate for religious ceremonies

648.8 --> 659.4799999999999
that kind of thing I don't know but yeah

651.91 --> 662.9499999999999
priorities money all that no I'm going

659.48 --> 662.95
off on a tangent whatever

683.23 --> 692.59
whoa serious brendham that is a lot wow

690.67 --> 697.6899999999999
that's really good news if that's real

692.59 --> 699.73
that's incredible all right so it could

697.69 --> 704.35
technically be revealed it wouldn't be

699.73 --> 706.51
the original material of course so the

704.35 --> 709.09
spirit of the makers and all that might

706.51 --> 714.43
be gone in a way it might feel different

709.09 --> 718.89
or at least at first but at least it

714.43 --> 718.89
could be rebuilt almost exactly the same

735.92 --> 741.579
hmm okay thanks keep me keep me posted

738.859 --> 741.5790000000001
about that

745.66 --> 748.66
yeah

782.21 --> 788.1700000000001
I think I've seen the Nutter dam like

784.49 --> 792.01
once from the outside never went inside

788.17 --> 792.01
it's a long time ago

797.17 --> 803.86
okay Samus thanks I guess

807.18 --> 812.0999999999999
hmm

808.89 --> 812.1
[Music]

821.569 --> 841.019
hmm Wow okay Brandon that is that is

830.999 --> 842.999
really good god I just I just hope that

841.019 --> 845.899
if they're actually gonna rebuild it

842.999 --> 849.239
that they're not gonna change [ __ ]

845.899 --> 858.559
because that would be really freaking

849.239 --> 858.5590000000001
annoying god yeah we'll see

871.2 --> 874.4590000000001
[Music]

880.38 --> 889.47
all right ute or maybe the spirit of the

883.56 --> 891.92
hunchback and lit the fire if there ever

889.47 --> 891.9200000000001
was one

919.58 --> 927.24
now flat enough it's not that bad look

923.37 --> 931.86
yellow fest rioting in France is well

927.24 --> 936.51
known by pretty much everyone and it is

931.86 --> 940.2
widely in news but on a local level

936.51 --> 940.71
about what's happening locally yeah it

940.2 --> 943.26
is

940.71 --> 946.23
being rather suppressed and you really

943.26 --> 949.53
have to go to the alternative channels

946.23 --> 953.07
or to the people's own blogs that are

949.53 --> 957.14
within the yellow vest really see what

953.07 --> 957.1400000000001
actually is going on on a local level

981.88 --> 990.53
Wow you'd you're making this really now

988.61 --> 993.5600000000001
you're making me think of really crazy

990.53 --> 996.4399999999999
conspiracy theories but yeah I already

993.56 --> 1002.9499999999999
said I'm pretty sure that it wasn't lit

996.44 --> 1005.0500000000001
by anyone by for [ __ ] sake I'll be

1002.95 --> 1011.11
done just don't focus on that

1005.05 --> 1013.8399999999999
but anyway so maybe the government just

1011.11 --> 1016.72
didn't have any fund this is like crazy

1013.84 --> 1020.44
conspiracy theory and I don't think this

1016.72 --> 1022.84
is real but just think about it the

1020.44 --> 1027.0900000000001
government doesn't have any funds so

1022.84 --> 1032.3500000000001
there's a couple of rich elitist that

1027.09 --> 1035.59
actually hate anything Christian but

1032.35 --> 1037.83
they're trying to pose as a Christian so

1035.59 --> 1040.9599999999998
one of them just says yeah you know what

1037.83 --> 1043.1799999999998
Michael or whatever or whoever is

1040.96 --> 1045.73
dealing with the repairs I know you

1043.18 --> 1048.28
don't have any funds but if you'll burn

1045.73 --> 1049.93
it down I'll actually help you to

1048.28 --> 1055.09
rebuild it because I just want to see it

1049.93 --> 1059.43
burn once come on you know now that's a

1055.09 --> 1059.4299999999998
crazy crazy idea

1068.29 --> 1071.29
yeah

1085.46 --> 1092.56
they evacuated how do you mean

1098.19 --> 1100.8500000000001
oh [ __ ]

1114.83 --> 1117.46
huh

1131.84 --> 1139.129
yeah that's what I kind of thought samus

1135.489 --> 1147.499
that ya evacuated or they all went out

1139.129 --> 1153.529
to lunch something went wrong I'm just

1147.499 --> 1156.739
curious as to if it's already out so has

1153.529 --> 1162.549
the fire department figured out what

1156.739 --> 1167.859
caused the fire was it like electrical

1162.549 --> 1173.109
cross wiring or wearing down and

1167.859 --> 1176.21
short-circuiting what was going on

1173.109 --> 1180.1899999999998
or was it equipment they were using for

1176.21 --> 1180.19
the renovation that just blew up

1189.01 --> 1195.309
yeah I don't want to hear who they think

1192.58 --> 1197.3799999999999
is guilty or not guilty I just want to

1195.309 --> 1203.49
hear what the technical cause is

1197.38 --> 1203.49
according to the to the fire department

1203.73 --> 1208.69
like the in actual investigation as to

1206.59 --> 1212.35
what caused the fire you know they have

1208.69 --> 1213.7
to do that it it's not that doesn't

1212.35 --> 1218.4699999999998
happen very quickly

1213.7 --> 1220.809
it's like detective work or act

1218.47 --> 1223.09
detective where it's what is it

1220.809 --> 1225.28
forensics worries it's forensics

1223.09 --> 1229.1689999999999
so I would like to see your if forensics

1225.28 --> 1229.1689999999999
reports as to what caused the fire

1238.48 --> 1241.559
[Music]

1252.41 --> 1255.41
scaffolding

1255.57 --> 1260.149
but how

1269.669 --> 1278.929
okay the only thing I can think of that

1274.049 --> 1286.079
if scaffolding would light up somehow is

1278.929 --> 1287.5790000000002
if there was a short-circuit so if there

1286.079 --> 1291.69
was some kind of electrical

1287.579 --> 1295.589
short-circuit happening without things

1291.69 --> 1298.289
actually without any know the name but

1295.589 --> 1300.599
stop that that stops it when in short

1298.289 --> 1302.149
circuits and just went on and started

1300.599 --> 1306.539
then

1302.149 --> 1309.2089999999998
yeah heating up metal or wires it

1306.539 --> 1311.849
causing that fire but otherwise I can't

1309.209 --> 1316.1290000000001
think of anything maybe some weird

1311.849 --> 1318.629
chemicals what the hell would be

1316.129 --> 1320.329
inflammatory chemicals I don't know I

1318.629 --> 1323.6589999999999
don't get it

1320.329 --> 1323.6589999999999
how would that work

1329.69 --> 1335.45
I don't know to me it seems most likely

1332.57 --> 1337.9099999999999
that if the fire would start out of

1335.45 --> 1345.05
nothing it would be some kind of

1337.91 --> 1347.8300000000002
equipment like an aggregate electrical

1345.05 --> 1347.83
aggregate maybe

1352.15 --> 1355.14
yeah

1366.419 --> 1369.2
all right

1375.62 --> 1378.62
hmm

1378.88 --> 1385.75
I look I can speculate all over the

1382.36 --> 1388.51
place maybe even say okay maybe they

1385.75 --> 1390.04
were using some kind of coating they

1388.51 --> 1393.55
were trying to coat everything to

1390.04 --> 1395.17
protect it but as long as the chemical

1393.55 --> 1399.1599999999999
reaction hasn't worn out it's actually

1395.17 --> 1403.99
inflammable so maybe it caught fire

1399.16 --> 1407.46
somehow I don't know it's that's I have

1403.99 --> 1407.46
no idea if they were doing that

1428.41 --> 1437.28
yeah anyway yeah so Avenue everyone is

1433.36 --> 1437.28
now all tied up into this

1464.39 --> 1468.8500000000001
what is de W

1494.64 --> 1500.5200000000002
that's that's just terrible Karen B

1500.94 --> 1512.67
could be at a freaking helicopter like

1508.48 --> 1514.81
in California and [ __ ] just beamed it

1512.67 --> 1518.8000000000002
it's just terrible

1514.81 --> 1521.25
I would do such a thing that's just

1518.8 --> 1521.25
crazy

1545.86 --> 1549.05
[Music]

1551.79 --> 1554.96
[Music]

1568.44 --> 1574.68
mmm all right

1572.04 --> 1580.35
well some us I'm not part of that I

1574.68 --> 1583.53
think still it just well nobody lit it

1580.35 --> 1590.6399999999999
so in that sense yeah a helicopter using

1583.53 --> 1593.34
a directed weapon I didn't see this is

1590.64 --> 1594.71
just weird because like yeah it is an X

1593.34 --> 1598.29
at almost an astral projection

1594.71 --> 1601.74
experience that I had and tried to

1598.29 --> 1605.6399999999999
prevent it but I didn't see it so go on

1601.74 --> 1608.73
the inside at least there's no activity

1605.64 --> 1610.3200000000002
so it was on the roof probably and if

1608.73 --> 1613.17
there was a helicopter outside I

1610.32 --> 1617.55
wouldn't have seen that yeah this sounds

1613.17 --> 1619.8000000000002
really weird okay but through the whole

1617.55 --> 1626.43
vision experience I don't know if any of

1619.8 --> 1628.11
that even real but I wanted to stop it I

1626.43 --> 1628.89
do remember that something like this

1628.11 --> 1633.6899999999998
would happen

1628.89 --> 1635.5500000000002
it's no use telling anyone just makes me

1633.69 --> 1637.5
look weird and I don't even know for

1635.55 --> 1640.35
sure if it'll happen until it happens

1637.5 --> 1646.71
but I have seen a lot of like these

1640.35 --> 1648.99
types of things happening but yeah I

1646.71 --> 1655.08
don't know in retrospect maybe it was a

1648.99 --> 1657.27
helicopter would be good to know if

1655.08 --> 1663.08
there was any helicopter activity in the

1657.27 --> 1663.08
vicinity right before the fire started

1699.13 --> 1701.91
all right

1702.62 --> 1708.35
yeah and I agree to that Karen B I'm not

1706.549 --> 1710.84
saying that that is the case but I am

1708.35 --> 1714.4089999999999
saying look there are ways to figure out

1710.84 --> 1716.3799999999999
if something could have been so like it

1714.409 --> 1719.1200000000001
was there a helicopter in the vicinity

1716.38 --> 1722.69
flying over or very near

1719.12 --> 1726.83
was it hovering still or something or

1722.69 --> 1731.179
what helicopter was it was it a French

1726.83 --> 1733.6689999999999
helicopter did and then learn about that

1731.179 --> 1737.48
helicopter more did it have any special

1733.669 --> 1740.5
devices mounted on it who was in that

1737.48 --> 1742.88
helicopter all that yeah it's just

1740.5 --> 1744.86
discover all over the place and then

1742.88 --> 1746.5100000000002
yeah the more clues you get the more you

1744.86 --> 1751.51
learn if it could have been something

1746.51 --> 1751.51
like that or just no not at all

1751.539 --> 1755.529
and then you can rule it out

1782.24 --> 1791.91
excuse me Orinoco bumble but yeah in

1788.52 --> 1795.21
cities helicopters flyer around a lot in

1791.91 --> 1798.72
utrecht here helicopters fly around a

1795.21 --> 1804.78
lot big cities have helicopters to

1798.72 --> 1807.42
scouts to define people on the run that

1804.78 --> 1810.93
kind of thing so yeah there's a lot of

1807.42 --> 1813.77
helicopters in cities what you're saying

1810.93 --> 1813.77
is completely wrong

1834.679 --> 1841.6490000000001
hmm are you being a status over here

1838.729 --> 1844.259
this is really annoying I'm just saying

1841.649 --> 1846.359
yeah you're probably not responding to

1844.259 --> 1848.039
me but to other people here but all I'm

1846.359 --> 1852.7189999999998
saying is you need to know the details

1848.039 --> 1856.049
everything just dig it through and then

1852.719 --> 1859.3490000000002
you have more data to go by to record

1856.049 --> 1861.1689999999999
and maybe reflect upon later when more

1859.349 --> 1865.259
evidence is brought to the table

1861.169 --> 1867.719
see that's investigative work that's

1865.259 --> 1875.299
what they did with 911 as well a lot of

1867.719 --> 1875.299
people because that data doesn't go away

1881.17 --> 1888.3700000000001
all right well Rambo Jambo look when

1884.65 --> 1890.5900000000001
everything is put in some kind of

1888.37 --> 1895.06
friction when there's a almost civil war

1890.59 --> 1898.4499999999998
going on when everything is push to

1895.06 --> 1900.6399999999999
fight against each other within ya

1898.45 --> 1902.29
everything becomes suspicious anything

1900.64 --> 1904.42
that what happened is like oh wow that

1902.29 --> 1906.6399999999999
is such an excellent timing yeah because

1904.42 --> 1909.28
everything is in friction so everything

1906.64 --> 1910.98
will seem suspicious or perfectly timed

1909.28 --> 1916.68
because it will have an effect that

1910.98 --> 1924.39
doesn't mean that it is time that it was

1916.68 --> 1929.44
purposely done necessarily so you know

1924.39 --> 1933.18
you need more data and then you can

1929.44 --> 1933.18
figure out what really happened

1958.85 --> 1965.779
all right so I am open for guests

1961.46 --> 1974.8990000000001
already put out the Hangout link and the

1965.779 --> 1978.85
earlybird chat i think right yeah I'll

1974.899 --> 1978.85
put it out in the master be chat as well

1992.29 --> 1994.92
right

1998.51 --> 2010.69
Oh Nathan instantly put out his link as

2003.76 --> 2013.95
well so yeah flat earth panel is open or

2010.69 --> 2013.95
Flat Earth debates panel

2031.55 --> 2044.43
right so anything else to talk about

2040.08 --> 2046.9399999999998
butts differ cannot read em what could

2044.43 --> 2046.94
have happened

2057.79 --> 2061.02
let's see

2081.829 --> 2089.849
ride yeah nothing really special it's

2086.099 --> 2099.0
pretty quiet except for the nuts are

2089.849 --> 2105.75
down oh yeah there was another Owen

wait I missed that oh yeah I sigh more

2112.41 --> 2118.819
watched with other stuff and stop

2116.43 --> 2123.0589999999997
watching it

2118.819 --> 2126.079
maybe I should look or watch it after

2123.059 --> 2126.079
this somewhere

2130.77 --> 2134.84
oh hi welcome back Daniel

2158.29 --> 2164.02
it's just too long ago too much chat

2161.71 --> 2168.04
I'll just try to look in the participant

2164.02 --> 2171.52
list ok so hello Ali be badge badge

2168.04 --> 2175.66
Daniel David Reath Donna threader and

2171.52 --> 2178.6
Drake Elon Musk goddess which Bella John

2175.66 --> 2182.95
Watson Jonathan Daugherty Juan Carlos

2178.6 --> 2188.47

dream Samus and Shayne Walter and well

2193.69 --> 2199.9500000000003
that's in the list at least and I see a

2196.39 --> 2199.95
lot of other people my warped mind

2205.41 --> 2212.12
all right then I think got everyone yeah

2222.06 --> 2225.139
[Music]

2229.17 --> 2236.26
say little personal health reports

2233.43 --> 2241.6299999999997
nothing too gross but yeah I'm pretty

2236.26 --> 2244.119
certain now that in the recent period in

2241.63 --> 2250.6600000000003
the last two weeks I was technically

2244.119 --> 2252.609
sick as in having a cold but in a yeah

2250.66 --> 2254.2
in such a diminished way that I didn't

2252.609 --> 2257.2
really experience it like that I just

2254.2 --> 2260.6189999999997
had a few annoying symptoms being a

2257.2 --> 2262.96
little sniffy here and there but yeah

2260.619 --> 2264.7000000000003
I'm I got evidence that I'm going

2262.96 --> 2268.119
through that cycle and that it's now

2264.7 --> 2269.9199999999996
ending so apparently I was sick just

2268.119 --> 2274.4500000000003
didn't really notice any symptoms of it

2269.92 --> 2279.2200000000003
or barely but yeah it's good because I

2274.45 --> 2284.47
really do want to just break out and get

2279.22 --> 2294.2099999999996
out there and bump into some interesting

2284.47 --> 2294.2099999999996
women maybe if I'm lucky all right

2299.23 --> 2312.64
get inspiration maybe find something a

2305.799 --> 2314.29
new hobby but I do feel like doing

2312.64 --> 2318.96
something with the spring here and not

2314.29 --> 2318.96
just staying in this room all the time

2321.75 --> 2332.29
hmm all right okay Karen B maybe maybe

2327.52 --> 2335.859
that is maybe that is it maybe it is

2332.29 --> 2340.44
just like allergies but I don't have any

2335.859 --> 2340.44
a fever nothing like that

2344.04 --> 2350.91
hmm I do get skin problems occasionally

2347.97 --> 2352.9199999999996
every now and then but yeah I don't

2350.91 --> 2356.21
really know what causes that

2352.92 --> 2360.1800000000003
it's weird I just say it's psychosomatic

2356.21 --> 2365.4900000000002
seems to be directly relating to yeah

2360.18 --> 2367.89
when I'm very anxious or out of whack

2365.49 --> 2371.7299999999996
then I tend to get that as a response

2367.89 --> 2375.75
but other than that no not that the

2371.73 --> 2377.76
typical allergies not in hay fever like

2375.75 --> 2380.01
people with hay fever like when they

2377.76 --> 2382.34
have symptoms like they just can breathe

2380.01 --> 2387.03
through their nose at all usually

2382.34 --> 2390.65
already got all swollen up all that no

2387.03 --> 2390.65
thank God nothing like that

2403.06 --> 2411.43
nah but really leb look I'm not that

2408.52 --> 2415.06
stressed out really if anything if

2411.43 --> 2418.0299999999997
anything that is bothering me it is some

2415.06 --> 2421.7799999999997
very long-term issues that I have life

2418.03 --> 2424.3
issues that I have that I'm just kind of

2421.78 --> 2427.75
figuring out like can I do anything with

2424.3 --> 2434.29
this yet and for the rest yeah that I

2427.75 --> 2437.74
kind of miss my ex again it is what

2434.29 --> 2439.96
happens when you yeah when you have

2437.74 --> 2444.0699999999997
fallen that deeply in love with somebody

2439.96 --> 2446.94
and then when certain it's like smell

2444.07 --> 2450.88
Association well I tend to associate

2446.94 --> 2454.03
spring times in general with her but

2450.88 --> 2459.4500000000003
it's not even really her it's just being

2454.03 --> 2461.92
with somebody like that in that way and

2459.45 --> 2464.77
the last memory I have to go on is her

2461.92 --> 2469.65
in that sense so that's that's the

2464.77 --> 2472.39
format the format it's taking but yeah

2469.65 --> 2476.5
so I have that kind of pressing on me

2472.39 --> 2478.6
other than that no I feel great I'm very

2476.5 --> 2482.8
optimistic actually yeah the world seems

2478.6 --> 2486.5699999999997
to be somewhat unnerving and people yeah

2482.8 --> 2490.75
I'm very disappointed in any great

2486.57 --> 2491.38
percentage of mankind now they conduct

2490.75 --> 2495.01
themselves

2491.38 --> 2500.08
it's just can't believe people let

2495.01 --> 2502.4
themselves go that far it's just it's

2500.08 --> 2507.3199999999997
out of control

2502.4 --> 2511.48
and it's repeal it repulses me but I was

2507.32 --> 2511.48
in that know I'm doing great

2515.95 --> 2521.8289999999997
and yeah I'm financially yeah it's

2518.41 --> 2524.68
always been a bit wonky but if I to be

2521.829 --> 2527.71
fair if I compare now with say two years

2524.68 --> 2529.27
ago I'm doing so much better so much

2527.71 --> 2532.329
better there's no more real financial

2529.27 --> 2535.5099999999998
panics on my side and the future's

2532.329 --> 2540.369
looking good my financial backer plan as

2535.51 --> 2545.3190000000004
I call it colloquially is working out

2540.369 --> 2549.839
fine so far and if things go alright

2545.319 --> 2554.14
yeah within a year's time I will be

2549.839 --> 2556.27
fully utilizing it and yeah a year is

2554.14 --> 2560.41
too long for me I want it now of course

2556.27 --> 2562.69
but yeah I can get through this fine and

2560.41 --> 2566.17
I'm getting so much help even from from

2562.69 --> 2572.7400000000002
this hangout from you guys yeah you are

2566.17 --> 2576.2200000000003
helping me a lot and that does also by

2572.74 --> 2581.6499999999996
the way pressure me on my shoulders that

2576.22 --> 2584.0789999999997
yeah I do have to really deliver and

2581.65 --> 2586.53
maybe that's good maybe I need that

2584.079 --> 2590.079
pressure not get too comfortable just

2586.53 --> 2592.869
fooling around because I get bored and

2590.079 --> 2594.6400000000003
maybe this yeah you're the financial

2592.869 --> 2599.92
support does give me a feeling like yeah

2594.64 --> 2603.5789999999997
I do really have to be worth that so it

2599.92 --> 2606.94
does help me also motivate me to

2603.579 --> 2608.98
continue on and yeah not in a negative

2606.94 --> 2612.2200000000003
way necessarily I find it interesting

2608.98 --> 2614.829
that I do have a impulse like yeah you

2612.22 --> 2617.29
have to do this that's good it's better

2614.829 --> 2620.819
than just doing nothing wasting all your

2617.29 --> 2620.819
time or most of it

2623.87 --> 2632.15
all right well if you don't want to do

2626.15 --> 2633.77
that fine mommy you don't want to

2632.15 --> 2636.04
support me then don't support me that's

2633.77 --> 2636.04
fine

2640.539 --> 2646.5200000000004
okay with me just sitting here and

2644.66 --> 2648.95
talking that's not really where my

2646.52 --> 2650.809
skills come out the most

2648.95 --> 2653.0
although yeah I can keep on talking I

2650.809 --> 2657.4100000000003
can do it it's not that extremely

2653.0 --> 2659.63
fascinating I think maybe other people

2657.41 --> 2661.819
do find it fascinating the way I do talk

2659.63 --> 2667.27
and the subjects that I deal with just

2661.819 --> 2670.19
me but I personally think that my best

2667.27 --> 2675.099
qualities come forth in conversation

2670.19 --> 2677.599
with other people I jump into a mode and

2675.099 --> 2679.549
the only problem I really do have is

2677.599 --> 2681.1400000000003
that when it happens especially if it

2679.549 --> 2682.7599999999998
hasn't happened for a long time is that

2681.14 --> 2685.49
I get over enthusiastic and start

2682.76 --> 2690.309
interrupting everyone almost instantly

2685.49 --> 2694.1299999999997
and that's it's it's antisocial but it I

2690.309 --> 2696.6800000000003
just when I'm that hyped up

2694.13 --> 2699.619
I just know exactly what they're going

2696.68 --> 2704.27
to be saying in a second like really for

2699.619 --> 2706.849
a big chunk of it it's almost like sort

2704.27 --> 2709.579
of short term telepathy it it it does

2706.849 --> 2715.7200000000003
work out but it's so disruptive when I

2709.579 --> 2720.279
just do it so yeah too much enthusiasm

2715.72 --> 2720.279
it's very hard to resist

2723.66 --> 2726.739
[Music]

2734.09 --> 2741.92
Jonathan Daugherty it's not literally

2736.62 --> 2745.41
telepathy it is just synchronizing it is

2741.92 --> 2747.9900000000002
it is like an instant back-engineering

2745.41 --> 2751.04
of the essence of somebody is putting

2747.99 --> 2754.1099999999997
out as they are in the process of

2751.04 --> 2756.27
explaining it and I just feel the

2754.11 --> 2757.77
essence it's just like this is exactly

2756.27 --> 2762.09
what he's going to be explaining and

2757.77 --> 2765.6
it's I'm rarely off sometimes I am off

2762.09 --> 2767.1000000000004
sometimes just get a chunk of it but

2765.6 --> 2768.95
then there's another point to it and I

2767.1 --> 2774.11
miss out on that because I preempted

2768.95 --> 2774.1099999999997
preempt it that's how it works

2795.56 --> 2804.32
I have no idea Oh Reno Koh lombo could

2801.44 --> 2806.38
be a lot of things I'm definitely not

2804.32 --> 2809.38
gonna be sitting in this cubicle

2806.38 --> 2809.38
absolutely

2821.16 --> 2834.1499999999996
right well Q and fee I do work some but

2830.0 --> 2836.88
look you can say in Holland they put

2834.15 --> 2838.98
people to work yeah that is in

2836.88 --> 2841.529
accordance to a certain system and

2838.98 --> 2845.069
there's a consent factor to it and

2841.529 --> 2849.24
there's a cultural element to it and I

2845.069 --> 2852.24
simply refused and went to the technical

2849.24 --> 2858.569
Constitution just said no it's just not

2852.24 --> 2862.3799999999997
true and they just stopped inquiring and

2858.569 --> 2864.96
I'd have I have a minimum Social Welfare

2862.38 --> 2868.38
okay there's a lot of people that I know

2864.96 --> 2873.7200000000003
that ask more on top of that and like

2868.38 --> 2875.9700000000003
disability or all these typical like

2873.72 --> 2878.43
extra help thingies that come with lots

2875.97 --> 2886.47
of strings attached I don't do that I I

2878.43 --> 2888.47
survive on the minimum and I eat organic

2886.47 --> 2894.269
I'm pretty damn impressed that I can

2888.47 --> 2896.43
survive like this and I do this a

2894.269 --> 2900.45
freakin newspaper which is which is a

2896.43 --> 2903.1189999999997
joke it is yeah ballers have ridiculed

2900.45 --> 2905.519
me about that and I get it it is a joke

2903.119 --> 2907.7400000000002
it is not really a job it's more like a

2905.519 --> 2911.549
hobby and I do it to make people happy

2907.74 --> 2914.1899999999996
and look this job it is actually

2911.549 --> 2916.74
designated to teenagers and stuff

2914.19 --> 2920.759
only the young people but they don't

2916.74 --> 2924.66
want to do it nobody wants to do this

2920.759 --> 2927.839
job because it pays nothing almost

2924.66 --> 2928.17
nothing but the people are really happy

2927.839 --> 2931.2889999999998
with it

2928.17 --> 2934.89
so I just do it for the people it's very

2931.289 --> 2936.869
socialist of me I don't know they really

2934.89 --> 2940.609
appreciate it it's not that much effort

2936.869 --> 2945.299
I just do it I can't drink it out of it

2940.609 --> 2948.3289999999997
fine I get to do something physical out

2945.299 --> 2950.819
there but not too often just weekly you

2948.329 --> 2954.53
know like that and I'm really good at it

2950.819 --> 2958.64
too like made it because it's easy I get

2954.53 --> 2960.4100000000003
apply my perfectionist skills just for

2958.64 --> 2963.94
the fun of it so it's like a hobby more

2960.41 --> 2963.94
it's not really refreshing

2970.75 --> 2976.56
yeah I'm I'm just doing this and

2978.45 --> 2983.83
sticking keeping myself to the

2981.51 --> 2986.38
constitutional law basically that's just

2983.83 --> 2990.06
yeah it almost sounds wrong but that's

2986.38 --> 2993.88
the Constitution so I'm just doing that

2990.06 --> 2997.15
and I'm not trying to be a bother not

2993.88 --> 2998.65
not trying to be a criminal and I guess

2997.15 --> 3002.13
they're kind of happy about that because

2998.65 --> 3005.609
there's people out here as well that do

3002.13 --> 3010.71
do that that do kind of the same thing

3005.609 --> 3014.7599999999998
they do also work they often do it don't

3010.71 --> 3020.16
pay taxes they scam around I don't do

3014.76 --> 3024.09
that [ __ ] I'm just a minimum yeah I just

3020.16 --> 3027.75
take the minimum trying to be very tidy

3024.09 --> 3031.38
nice and survive with that and have side

3027.75 --> 3035.55
plans to eventually bypass it and then

3031.38 --> 3038.4
see ya without having to have a career I

3035.55 --> 3040.349
just used a freaking financial plan it's

3038.4 --> 3043.2000000000003
weird it's weird it's not how most

3040.349 --> 3045.54
people would do it I totally agree but I

3043.2 --> 3049.73
am really weird in that sense and this

3045.54 --> 3055.94
is how I do it and I think it could work

3049.73 --> 3055.94
and then I could potentially do business

3056.06 --> 3059.839
with what I got

3060.03 --> 3066.69
and yeah spend my time ha being and

3064.19 --> 3068.58
working on my craft working on my

3066.69 --> 3071.52
goldsmithing being artists all that

3068.58 --> 3075.65
that's my priority that that is what I

3071.52 --> 3075.65
would have always been wanting to do

3094.56 --> 3097.04
yes

3097.099 --> 3105.4500000000003
right Fyodor Dostoevsky I do enjoy my

3103.14 --> 3109.2599999999998
tea and yeah in a way you are right but

3105.45 --> 3112.79
the funny thing is I change I can change

3109.26 --> 3115.349
myself as I'm doing all this and

3112.79 --> 3118.5299999999997
reflecting honestly and proofing my

3115.349 --> 3122.46
logos and having this reference having

3118.53 --> 3124.5890000000004
people knowing me whether they agree

3122.46 --> 3128.099
with me or not but they can test me and

3124.589 --> 3133.099
through being tested I'm being tested in

3128.099 --> 3138.15
my character in my resolves in my spirit

3133.099 --> 3141.059
in my knowledge so yeah I'm not being

3138.15 --> 3144.23
tested maybe by society and well I am

3141.059 --> 3147.5690000000004
being tested and I basically step away I

3144.23 --> 3150.619
step away I that's really weird to say

3147.569 --> 3156.75
but I do feel like a societal outcast

3150.619 --> 3160.02
not socially but the system and the job

3156.75 --> 3165.589
system and how people are expected to do

3160.02 --> 3167.78
these things I just it never worked I

3165.589 --> 3171.42
was terrible at it

3167.78 --> 3175.1400000000003
despite being skilled and talented I was

3171.42 --> 3179.15
terrible at jobs and [ __ ] I hated it so

3175.14 --> 3184.3799999999997
badly and didn't go away and it really

3179.15 --> 3189.39
ruins my skills the ways that I can

3184.38 --> 3191.7000000000003
apply myself it just didn't work I'm

3189.39 --> 3193.6189999999997
terrible at it so that's why I'm trying

3191.7 --> 3195.8999999999996
this I'm trying to bypass it and

3193.619 --> 3199.109
actually still be able to be some kind

3195.9 --> 3204.799
of success without demolishing myself in

3199.109 --> 3204.799
the way you know can you blame me

3211.45 --> 3220.99
it's I'm just an artist type how I do

3218.5 --> 3224.28
things things come to me spontaneously I

3220.99 --> 3227.43
have to be in the zone to be at peace

3224.28 --> 3233.1400000000003
don't have to be preoccupied with

3227.43 --> 3235.839
tedious [ __ ] or highly morally objective

3233.14 --> 3237.549
things or just minor moral objective

3235.839 --> 3244.299
things that most people don't even care

3237.549 --> 3247.93
about just for example having to listen

3244.299 --> 3250.869
to mainstream radio all day which a lot

3247.93 --> 3260.46
of jobs basically forced onto you drive

3250.869 --> 3260.46
me nuts I can't stand that [ __ ] you know

3273.43 --> 3276.27
hmm

3276.51 --> 3279.579
[Music]

3285.35 --> 3289.1189999999997
[Music]

3291.309 --> 3297.909
all right because with me it's I just

3295.479 --> 3301.239
object to the money system in a weird

3297.909 --> 3302.9790000000003
way like I don't like how everything is

3301.239 --> 3305.529
tied together and that how you can lose

3302.979 --> 3308.739
track of what really matters and just

3305.529 --> 3310.719
look at the financial ties I don't like

3308.739 --> 3311.259
that it exists I don't want to be part

3310.719 --> 3314.739
of that

3311.259 --> 3316.39
I want to craft I want to do things I

3314.739 --> 3320.849
want to fix things I want to design

3316.39 --> 3325.689
things make things think up things

3320.849 --> 3327.699
really make the craft and then if there

3325.689 --> 3329.949
is some kind of money involved of that

3327.699 --> 3333.7290000000003
fine what I'd want to do it for the

3329.949 --> 3335.859
craft not for the freaking money and if

3333.729 --> 3336.489
you're gonna make a profession out of

3335.859 --> 3339.069
something

3336.489 --> 3341.38
then eventually somehow the system

3339.069 --> 3346.269
always forces you to do that and I just

3341.38 --> 3356.1400000000003
can't stand it I can't continue doing

3346.269 --> 3358.2389999999996
that I'll lose my creativity it happened

3356.14 --> 3360.819
when I became a goldsmith

3358.239 --> 3367.349
because I did that profession is sort of

3360.819 --> 3367.349
just it just died out

3379.09 --> 3386.08
but I did enjoy just doing orders for

3383.65 --> 3390.19
example I did make a quite a few jewels

3386.08 --> 3393.04
and wedding rings and pendants all that

3390.19 --> 3395.4700000000003
and I enjoyed it because the people

3393.04 --> 3400.54
really appreciated and they thought it

3395.47 --> 3403.68
was a good price I just I'm just a

3400.54 --> 3407.11
terrible I'm just terrible as a

3403.68 --> 3411.24
corporate person and I'm just about the

3407.11 --> 3411.2400000000002
craft about how it can influence people

3413.01 --> 3420.9900000000002
you know what I would do great if I have

3416.23 --> 3423.97
like a wife that would be really like

3420.99 --> 3426.33
intervie and just say no no the price

3423.97 --> 3431.2599999999998
has to be this and I'm like what come on

3426.33 --> 3433.15
you know so tough but that kind of I

3431.26 --> 3435.9700000000003
don't know maybe it that's just a

3433.15 --> 3438.52
fantasy I should probably just learn to

3435.97 --> 3441.87
be a little bit more financially

3438.52 --> 3445.5099999999998
responsible in business myself and not

3441.87 --> 3450.93
again grow dependency on somebody else

3445.51 --> 3450.9300000000003
at that yeah I've made my mistakes

3459.43 --> 3466.02
right so it's a it's kind of filled with

3462.94 --> 3466.02
baller trolls here

3469.12 --> 3477.04
hmm yeah I thought you work a god

3471.85 --> 3480.42
goddess which Bella yeah you you do make

3477.04 --> 3483.42
crafts as well professionally it's very

3480.42 --> 3483.42
interesting

3484.05 --> 3488.7000000000003
I've met more people that do that

3488.91 --> 3500.19
quite a few actually it's very

3494.11 --> 3500.19
satisfying life I think

3508.05 --> 3515.5800000000004
yeah

3509.76 --> 3517.71
uh Barbara Barbie who I rich in the said

3515.58 --> 3520.2
that I should slap her and that was a

3517.71 --> 3521.07
meme for a while that person she does

3520.2 --> 3526.1099999999997
that as well

3521.07 --> 3529.26
and some other people from from way back

3526.11 --> 3532.02
from other social media that I knew did

3529.26 --> 3534.3300000000004
that as well so I've met a few also

3532.02 --> 3537.72
before that yeah poof I must have met a

3534.33 --> 3546.2
dozen of people that make that do

3537.72 --> 3546.2
typical crafts jewelry for money so

3551.749 --> 3555.749
all right so I'm gonna round out the

3554.19 --> 3558.509
show because this is getting kind of

3555.749 --> 3560.8689999999997
silly and full of trolls and I don't

3558.509 --> 3565.859
really have anything else to talk about

3560.869 --> 3568.7690000000002
the nut road um yeah it sucks there's

3565.859 --> 3572.249
some say that it's gonna be completely

3568.769 --> 3575.3689999999997
reconstructed now so why how insurance

3572.249 --> 3579.709
scam somebody elated I don't think so no

3575.369 --> 3583.4100000000003
or there's some kind of electromagnetic

3579.709 --> 3586.68
weaponry attached shot helicopters or

3583.41 --> 3590.66
whatever that lit it what what caused

3586.68 --> 3598.229
that so there's a lot of information to

3590.66 --> 3600.299
dig into and research forensics and yeah

3598.229 --> 3601.769
that's that's about the only really

3600.299 --> 3603.479
interesting thing in this hangout the

3601.769 --> 3607.2589999999996
rest is just me babbling on about my

3603.479 --> 3613.2189999999996
