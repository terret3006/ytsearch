you guys well know

100.32 --> 106.63999999999999
right so before we get to the guest

105.119 --> 111.659
the weather report

106.64 --> 115.07900000000001
it's kind of gray a little bit Misty

111.659 --> 118.02000000000001
cold not super interesting what's the

115.079 --> 120.29899999999999
birds flying around seagulls

118.02 --> 123.19999999999999
right

120.299 --> 123.2
it's pretty cold

126.36 --> 128.96
all right

136.44 --> 141.599
hello hello hold on stairs you are still

139.379 --> 144.72
you were not on mute dude I could see

141.599 --> 147.78
your but anyway yeah he's he's on the

144.72 --> 149.879
other side stasmaritz is with me today

147.78 --> 151.5
we actually have been talking I'm a

149.879 --> 153.5
little bit late on the show because we

151.5 --> 158.459
couldn't stop talking

153.5 --> 160.62
it was uh interesting right so

158.459 --> 162.36
before I get to you

160.62 --> 167.04
it is

162.36 --> 168.72000000000003
Sunday the 29th of January 2023

167.04 --> 171.06
we got a couple of people here of

168.72 --> 173.459
Desmond Reds of course first in chat in

171.06 --> 175.739
Sandy Insanity Bill Nye the science

173.459 --> 177.48
denier

175.739 --> 178.98000000000002
good to see you

177.48 --> 183.06
right

178.98 --> 185.76
so yeah our guest is here

183.06 --> 189.48
stez how are you doing

185.76 --> 192.29999999999998
I'm fine I'm fine how how are you I I

189.48 --> 194.22
suppose I should say well I feel quite

192.3 --> 197.9
exhilarated right now because I don't

194.22 --> 197.9
know this conversation's been really

199.099 --> 207.12
yeah and I got to talk Dutch for a

204.599 --> 210.29999999999998
change on a high level which is like

207.12 --> 212.09900000000002
really awesome for somebody that yeah to

210.3 --> 214.5
somebody else because I mean I have

212.099 --> 217.01899999999998
still a couple of people that I talk to

214.5 --> 217.879
on a high level in Dutch my dad and my

217.019 --> 221.58
friend

217.879 --> 224.099
but she's like total different mindset

221.58 --> 226.739
like she's not into mechanics at all

224.099 --> 230.39999999999998
she's like a pure dreamer so I can

226.739 --> 232.86
really get like get her complicated talk

230.4 --> 235.799
and like we can communicate but I can't

232.86 --> 238.019
talk about like this stuff as close up

235.799 --> 240.72
because she's just not into social media

238.019 --> 242.22
that much right and my dad

240.72 --> 244.62
well

242.22 --> 246.72
yeah he has his own route but I can't

244.62 --> 249.239
talk to him I just don't do it all the

246.72 --> 251.819
time anyway so it's good to have you man

249.239 --> 254.28
and I'm really looking forward to this

251.819 --> 255.44
entire show I bet it's gonna be over in

254.28 --> 258.239
a jiffy

255.44 --> 260.04
yeah it could well very well be yeah

258.239 --> 261.239
yeah for sure I've been listening to

260.04 --> 262.97900000000004
your show for quite a while actually

261.239 --> 266.09999999999997
like that I told you once before I think

262.979 --> 268.68
the first show I've seen was like

266.1 --> 272.58000000000004
somewhere in the in the like

268.68 --> 274.199
far 300s or low 400s of your episodes

272.58 --> 276.3
and then

274.199 --> 278.28000000000003
yeah I just every now and then I drop in

276.3 --> 280.56
usually when I'm at work because uh you

278.28 --> 283.5
know I have an office job and around the

280.56 --> 285.479
time that you get on it's usually very

283.5 --> 288.419
quiet so I have the time to like listen

285.479 --> 289.68
in and uh and see what's what and see

288.419 --> 293.15999999999997
see what you guys are talking about

289.68 --> 296.46
right since when did you start checking

293.16 --> 299.40000000000003
in like well uh I I guess I first

296.46 --> 302.46
discovered you like just before your

299.4 --> 305.4
400th episode and

302.46 --> 307.13899999999995
um okay mainly the reason why because as

305.4 --> 309.35999999999996
you know I'm not a flat earther and

307.139 --> 311.40000000000003
that's also why I suggest it come on the

309.36 --> 312.96000000000004
show because you know that I I like that

311.4 --> 315.419
contrast but

312.96 --> 317.28
um there's loads of people that believe

315.419 --> 321.0
in the Flat Earth on YouTube and there's

317.28 --> 324.71999999999997
loads of people that believe uh in which

321.0 --> 327.84
you said like the glober on YouTube I I

324.72 --> 330.36
I watch both sometimes but I gravitated

327.84 --> 332.82
to you obviously because you're a Dutch

330.36 --> 335.039
like me right actually I'm half Dutch

332.82 --> 338.09999999999997
but I'm just as Indonesian Azure that's

335.039 --> 341.82
the funny thing as well oh really my

338.1 --> 344.1
father's one one sixteenth or one eight

341.82 --> 346.74
um uh actually my dad's half Indonesian

344.1 --> 349.62
because his mom is Dutch and his father

346.74 --> 351.72
was in division so that makes me a

349.62 --> 353.699
quarter Indonesian I guess

351.72 --> 356.58000000000004
all right well then you're even more

353.699 --> 360.66
Indonesian than me that's funny well

356.58 --> 362.15999999999997
yeah so um yeah that's I guess that's

360.66 --> 364.259
why I kind of stuck around you know

362.16 --> 366.47900000000004
that's why because you know fellow

364.259 --> 369.78000000000003
countrymen thinking things that are

366.479 --> 371.94
exactly opposite to what I think and I

369.78 --> 373.79999999999995
just found like I was trying to get down

371.94 --> 377.16
to the psychology of it like I don't

373.8 --> 378.479
really interest myself as much into the

377.16 --> 381.6
things that you interested yourself

378.479 --> 385.31899999999996
interested yourself into like uh the

381.6 --> 387.24
mechanics about Flat Earth or like what

385.319 --> 389.22
I'm trying to say is like I I there's

387.24 --> 391.319
not much it's a lot of math and geometry

389.22 --> 393.18
and stuff right what I'm trying to say

391.319 --> 396.0
is like there's not a lot I could say to

393.18 --> 399.84000000000003
defend my position like there's yeah I

396.0 --> 402.9
know that's good the only the only thing

399.84 --> 404.4
I could say like in in like uh for

402.9 --> 406.85999999999996
example

404.4 --> 409.19899999999996
uh certain things that you address

406.86 --> 412.139
sometimes in your show maybe not you in

409.199 --> 414.18
particular but uh there's a thing that

412.139 --> 417.539
caught my eye not so long ago because

414.18 --> 419.34000000000003
apparently uh well not apparently but

417.539 --> 421.08
according to television and Internet

419.34 --> 424.25899999999996
there's been a couple of rocket launches

421.08 --> 426.71999999999997
right so yeah I I look at the rocket

424.259 --> 429.78000000000003
launch and then I think about

426.72 --> 431.94000000000005
the I don't know how how if if you call

429.78 --> 434.35999999999996
it the same but the atmospheric gradient

431.94 --> 434.36
right

436.02 --> 440.75899999999996
um I'm not sure because some flat

438.24 --> 444.12
earthers think there's gradient and some

440.759 --> 445.38
don't I'm kind of don't no no no is

444.12 --> 446.58
there a gradient or is there not yeah

445.38 --> 448.8
duh

446.58 --> 450.96
there's a cradle okay no well then my

448.8 --> 453.18
point is mute because the thing when I

450.96 --> 457.979
was like I'm it's moot by the way not

453.18 --> 460.08
mute just say it's a common mistake yeah

457.979 --> 462.71999999999997
um so when when that rocket launches

460.08 --> 465.9
right you have like the exhaust which is

462.72 --> 469.199
a a a a form and then when it goes up

465.9 --> 471.23999999999995
that plume kind of extends which tells

469.199 --> 473.52000000000004
me there must be a gradient because the

471.24 --> 476.40000000000003
pressure gets lower the further you go

473.52 --> 478.56
up and that's why that rocket plume fans

476.4 --> 480.17999999999995
out kind of that's just what I'm

478.56 --> 482.699
thinking like yeah of course it's hot

480.18 --> 485.699
it's gonna expand it's it comes out

482.699 --> 487.44
compressed right it's that's what

485.699 --> 490.259
creates the propulsion

487.44 --> 491.71999999999997
okay well okay the compression I was

490.259 --> 494.52000000000004
trying to bring up that point but

491.72 --> 496.199
apparently so yeah you believe in in an

494.52 --> 497.75899999999996
atom straight gradient as well so we

496.199 --> 499.91900000000004
could pull up other well it's not about

497.759 --> 503.52000000000004
believing it's literally measurably

499.919 --> 505.37899999999996
there and like people have actually I

503.52 --> 507.0
think including flat earthers have like

505.379 --> 510.84000000000003
sent up balloons

507.0 --> 513.779
to measure that yeah so like not even

510.84 --> 516.0
we're not even just relying on official

513.779 --> 518.039
rollout data or whatever it's like

516.0 --> 520.8
people have tested it themselves like

518.039 --> 522.959
even anti-flat Earth there's would do

520.8 --> 525.7199999999999
that like Mr sensible actually send up a

522.959 --> 527.459
balloon then he was like thinking is oh

525.72 --> 529.74
this is all proof of the globe whatever

527.459 --> 531.3599999999999
but he did actually just take these

529.74 --> 533.64
measurements and that's

531.36 --> 535.92
like a confirmation

533.64 --> 537.959
from an enemy data thinking that they're

535.92 --> 539.16
in the wind is usually more reliable

537.959 --> 541.92
because

539.16 --> 544.68
they they didn't tamper with it why is

541.92 --> 547.0799999999999
there an atmospheric gradient because I

544.68 --> 549.68
think then there's a point where we kind

547.08 --> 553.88
of diverge in thoughts because

549.68 --> 556.8
obviously to me it's because of gravity

553.88 --> 558.48
gradients hello yeah I don't know how

556.8 --> 561.18
that how it would do that though because

558.48 --> 564.54
air is not susceptible to momentum as I

561.18 --> 566.42
like to say it it doesn't have effective

564.54 --> 569.519
Mass it it

566.42 --> 573.06
doesn't an air molecule have

569.519 --> 575.22
a certain amount of mass

573.06 --> 579.1199999999999
no

575.22 --> 581.76
well why not because mass is technically

579.12 --> 585.839
yeah it's a complicated thing right but

581.76 --> 589.62
like any any molecule any atom any atom

585.839 --> 592.2600000000001
that you know forms a molecule has a

589.62 --> 594.54
certain Mass like I'm again yeah but now

592.26 --> 599.04
you're talking about atomic mass an

594.54 --> 602.5799999999999
atomic mass is different from Mass

599.04 --> 606.54
because Mass is like a derivative from

602.58 --> 608.0400000000001
density right but the thing is is that

606.54 --> 611.279
yeah

608.04 --> 614.0999999999999
it also has other implications like it's

611.279 --> 616.86
been entangled in through the physics

614.1 --> 620.16
mechanisms with as you say Newtonian

616.86 --> 622.74
type mechanics like and susceptible to

620.16 --> 623.88
momentum like it is part of that too

622.74 --> 625.74
like

623.88 --> 627.779
something that has mass you could throw

625.74 --> 631.5600000000001
it and then it keeps going it has

627.779 --> 632.459
momentum right yeah gas gas doesn't have

631.56 --> 636.2399999999999
that

632.459 --> 638.8199999999999
okay well yeah in any way every on gas

636.24 --> 640.6800000000001
is very different state like that it

638.82 --> 642.72
doesn't have that mass it's not

640.68 --> 644.76
susceptible by momentum what it does is

642.72 --> 647.7
it responds to local air pressure

644.76 --> 649.26
differential and that is the only thing

647.7 --> 651.899
it responds to

649.26 --> 654.54
it's thicker pressure it moves to where

651.899 --> 657.12
it's less thick in an immediate sense

654.54 --> 660.18
and then tries it just equalizes

657.12 --> 662.64
directly around it right and that's the

660.18 --> 664.3199999999999
resistance of air too that's basically

662.64 --> 668.16
the same effect

664.32 --> 671.22
so the molecular mass of oxygen and

668.16 --> 674.6999999999999
nitrogen or the thing we breathe

671.22 --> 677.399
does not have mass at least according to

674.7 --> 680.1
you well it has atomic mass right it is

677.399 --> 683.459
a particle that has atomic mass but

680.1 --> 686.0400000000001
that's not the same thing as mass like

683.459 --> 689.3
the actual mass that you use for

686.04 --> 689.3
calculating physics things

689.82 --> 695.279
right it's complicated it really is this

693.0 --> 697.68
was a really big head cruncher for me

695.279 --> 700.38
when I was younger like I couldn't get

697.68 --> 702.8389999999999
that it was very confusing to me

700.38 --> 705.0
but it's like because atomic mass is

702.839 --> 708.72
really more about chemistry like the

705.0 --> 710.279
chemistry divisions of things like how

708.72 --> 712.98
much of this compared to how much of

710.279 --> 715.92
that how much mass this versus that

712.98 --> 719.04
right but it's not a physics application

715.92 --> 723.42
okay so I I looked it up real quick okay

719.04 --> 726.3
uh just just to you know make it more uh

723.42 --> 727.1999999999999
um digestible for myself so when I look

726.3 --> 730.74
it up

727.2 --> 734.4590000000001
what it says is mass is a a whole number

730.74 --> 737.04
because it's the sum of number of proton

734.459 --> 739.4399999999999
and number of neutrons whereas atomic

737.04 --> 741.66
mass is a fractional

739.44 --> 745.5600000000001
because it's the average of relative

741.66 --> 748.5
mass of its atoms as compared with math

745.56 --> 752.5189999999999
Mass sorry not math Mass

748.5 --> 755.959
an atom of C12 isotope taken as 12. I

752.519 --> 755.9590000000001
don't know what the [ __ ] that means but

756.32 --> 761.4590000000001
that's called a measurement standard

758.7 --> 763.9200000000001
right they're taking this molecule which

761.459 --> 767.6999999999999
I'm very sure is a solid

763.92 --> 770.579
and then comparing the the weights

767.7 --> 774.0600000000001
basically on a micro scale but this is

770.579 --> 776.279
really more chemistry you see even the

774.06 --> 777.4799999999999
lingo that you just rolled out that's

776.279 --> 779.279
chemistry

777.48 --> 781.74
do you see that there is a fine line

779.279 --> 783.72
between chemistry and and physics yeah

781.74 --> 787.5
and physics it's very different because

783.72 --> 790.9200000000001
physics it's all about mechanics right

787.5 --> 793.44
well chemistry is about

790.92 --> 795.86
the relation between the different

793.44 --> 799.86
things there between the different

795.86 --> 802.6800000000001
bodies atoms micro protons neutrons it's

799.86 --> 804.54
all about the the differentials between

802.68 --> 806.5999999999999
the different elements that it's a whole

804.54 --> 809.3389999999999
different approach chemistry

806.6 --> 811.8000000000001
so so all about the divisions between

809.339 --> 813.32
things physics is really mechanics it's

811.8 --> 816.8389999999999
like what happens

813.32 --> 819.6
what about what what Mr George Sanford

816.839 --> 821.7600000000001
just said pressurized gas has a

819.6 --> 823.26
measurable weight yeah that's just

821.76 --> 824.16
George stands for is never letting that

823.26 --> 826.68
go

824.16 --> 828.0
it's just but it isn't it is he right

826.68 --> 831.18
though

828.0 --> 833.04
I've never pressurized gas and try to

831.18 --> 834.8389999999999
weigh it like it's not something I would

833.04 --> 836.88
try to do well the whole point is yeah

834.839 --> 839.7
if you pressurize it enough it's gonna

836.88 --> 842.279
form liquid most gases do especially air

839.7 --> 844.6800000000001
it turns into liquid right the regular

842.279 --> 846.779
air combination that we have when they

844.68 --> 849.2399999999999
pressurize that it turns into liquid and

846.779 --> 851.639
then it attains a weight but it's

849.24 --> 854.04
because it's in its liquid state if you

851.639 --> 856.26
just filled it with regular air

854.04 --> 858.3
it doesn't have weight that weighs

856.26 --> 860.7
nothing it's you're just gonna weigh the

858.3 --> 863.519
tanker it's barely going to register is

860.7 --> 866.639
it not is it not just a matter of adding

863.519 --> 869.279
more of a substance and then you know it

866.639 --> 871.74
it's more it's easier to measure because

869.279 --> 874.4399999999999
that's not an infinitesimal amount of

871.74 --> 876.899
weight the point is the point that I

874.44 --> 879.9590000000001
even bring up gas doesn't have mass is

876.899 --> 882.899
because gas in its expanded state

879.959 --> 885.5999999999999
doesn't have mass again this is about

882.899 --> 888.779
physics about the natural state the gas

885.6 --> 892.0790000000001
out there it doesn't have mass but yeah

888.779 --> 894.12
as a molecule it could it does have mass

892.079 --> 896.399
right you can compress it it'll turn to

894.12 --> 898.079
liquid and then it will actually just

896.399 --> 900.5
like a liquid have that weight but

898.079 --> 904.3199999999999
that's not a natural condition though

900.5 --> 906.839
right so because the point is right

904.32 --> 909.48
we're delving into chemistry now and the

906.839 --> 912.839
difference is the original argument is

909.48 --> 916.38
about gravity a conception within

912.839 --> 918.36
physics pulling on the gas in order to

916.38 --> 920.9399999999999
form the gradient that is why this

918.36 --> 923.5790000000001
entire conversation roll out do you

920.94 --> 925.5600000000001
remember and my point is is that that

923.579 --> 927.779
aspect is impossible it doesn't have

925.56 --> 931.38
momentum it's not

927.779 --> 933.779
weight is a derived thing right weight

931.38 --> 936.899
is actually air weight that means

933.779 --> 941.279
relative density this equilibrium

936.899 --> 943.86
of an object versus the air the density

941.279 --> 946.4399999999999
ratio right the differential between

943.86 --> 949.5600000000001
that and that is standardized in weight

946.44 --> 951.5400000000001
using air weight but you also have other

949.56 --> 954.2399999999999
weighing methods that are officially

951.54 --> 957.959
known that I've dealt with myself you

954.24 --> 960.54
see you have water weight as well and

957.959 --> 964.5
that is used for example in weighing uh

960.54 --> 967.62
jewelry like gemstones I use that in my

964.5 --> 969.779
when I went goldsmithing yeah and there

967.62 --> 972.6
is vacuum weight and they are all

969.779 --> 975.6
different forms of weight because

972.6 --> 979.62
they're based on relative density offset

975.6 --> 983.16
in other mediums well regular weight is

979.62 --> 985.139
just air weight what does something how

983.16 --> 987.8389999999999
much this equilibrium does an object

985.139 --> 989.9590000000001
have in relation to the medium of

987.839 --> 992.4590000000001
Standard air

989.959 --> 994.1389999999999
that is weight

992.459 --> 997.2589999999999
but they don't mention all that they

994.139 --> 999.48
just say wait and then you can unleash

997.259 --> 1001.94
the gravity mechanics on that thinking

999.48 --> 1004.6990000000001
that oh so that is gravity pulling on

1001.94 --> 1007.2790000000001
the mass but it doesn't work because air

1004.699 --> 1009.8599999999999
doesn't have mass

1007.279 --> 1012.86
and so in that relation in that physics

1009.86 --> 1015.0790000000001
relation that relates to weight right so

1012.86 --> 1017.6
the relative density thing you just said

1015.079 --> 1019.579
that's that's in in your monthly

1017.6 --> 1022.759
explanation for the gradient in the

1019.579 --> 1026.059
atmosphere no oh what about what is then

1022.759 --> 1028.28
does yeah let's get to that right I was

1026.059 --> 1030.819
just first trying to debunk that gravity

1028.28 --> 1034.04
has an effect to cause that it doesn't

1030.819 --> 1037.1599999999999
it's just there's other influences right

1034.04 --> 1040.54
we have a complicated dynamic system out

1037.16 --> 1043.28
there there is heat at the ground level

1040.54 --> 1046.8799999999999
and there's chemical reactions happening

1043.28 --> 1049.82
at the ground level which uh moist

1046.88 --> 1051.3200000000002
evaporates at ground level right there's

1049.82 --> 1053.299
so there's a lot more moist in the air

1051.32 --> 1057.6789999999999
all these things combination with the

1053.299 --> 1060.62
heat causes there to be more pressure

1057.679 --> 1062.8400000000001
locally right if there if those

1060.62 --> 1065.7199999999998
influences would all stop right no more

1062.84 --> 1067.52
heat from the Sun any kind of form uh

1065.72 --> 1069.44
well the chemical reaction certainly a

1067.52 --> 1071.84
lot of them are going to stop and then

1069.44 --> 1074.96
the pressure will eventually equalize

1071.84 --> 1077.059
and it will be all Frozen here right

1074.96 --> 1078.38
so you say if that would happen the

1077.059 --> 1081.08
gradient would disappear and everything

1078.38 --> 1082.94
would be yes at a certain equilibrium

1081.08 --> 1084.6789999999999
it's because there's energy being

1082.94 --> 1086.96
introduced through the sun and the

1084.679 --> 1088.94
chemical reactions that are correlating

1086.96 --> 1091.94
with that at ground level that are

1088.94 --> 1093.74
causing this pressure right and this can

1091.94 --> 1096.5
be uh

1093.74 --> 1099.08
compared to a test that have I have seen

1096.5 --> 1099.86
which is a very interesting model if you

1099.08 --> 1103.9399999999998
have

1099.86 --> 1105.32
a uh like a fish tank with air in it or

1103.94 --> 1107.539
some kind of a gas you could use

1105.32 --> 1110.299
whatever right you close it off

1107.539 --> 1112.8799999999999
completely and then you take a cooling

1110.299 --> 1115.58
element you put it on one side of the

1112.88 --> 1116.72
tanker and then a heating element on the

1115.58 --> 1118.58
other side

1116.72 --> 1122.3600000000001
well guess what's going to happen

1118.58 --> 1124.22
a gradient is going to form within the

1122.36 --> 1127.1599999999999
the pressure of the gas within that

1124.22 --> 1129.6200000000001
tanker it's going to be dynamic but it's

1127.16 --> 1131.78
going to pan out into a gradient

1129.62 --> 1134.299
the hotter side will have more pressure

1131.78 --> 1136.6399999999999
and the colder side will have less

1134.299 --> 1139.7
isn't that amazing isn't that because

1136.64 --> 1143.3600000000001
the the the the the the what do you call

1139.7 --> 1145.88
it the atoms uh will it's like I'm a

1143.36 --> 1148.52
quantum physics well look look isn't it

1145.88 --> 1151.1000000000001
because it because he will make the

1148.52 --> 1153.44
atoms vibrate more than cold that's that

1151.1 --> 1155.24
that's about like how heat works and

1153.44 --> 1157.1000000000001
that it will cause pressure right when

1155.24 --> 1159.559
something hits up it will create

1157.1 --> 1162.3799999999999
pressure especially gas because it's it

1159.559 --> 1164.299
moves freely so it goes you know it can

1162.38 --> 1166.16
go in all directions it will immediately

1164.299 --> 1169.82
increase its pressure

1166.16 --> 1172.52
and then thus move right but okay

1169.82 --> 1175.3999999999999
because of the dynamic influence of

1172.52 --> 1177.74
these cold and heat elements a gradient

1175.4 --> 1179.419
will form now you can theorize how that

1177.74 --> 1182.0
like why does it do that that's

1179.419 --> 1183.44
interesting let's see what happens but

1182.0 --> 1185.12
the the point is

1183.44 --> 1186.0800000000002
it happens

1185.12 --> 1188.9599999999998
um

1186.08 --> 1191.539
and that is only with heat and cold

1188.96 --> 1194.3600000000001
influences not even with being with

1191.539 --> 1196.64
stuff being created chemically on one

1194.36 --> 1200.4189999999999
side right which is occurring here so

1196.64 --> 1202.7
there is a direct very very sound

1200.419 --> 1205.2800000000002
correlation

1202.7 --> 1207.32
to point at and like look see you can

1205.28 --> 1209.84
create a gradient with only heat and

1207.32 --> 1212.6
cold influence now there is heat at

1209.84 --> 1214.9399999999998
ground level and I'm pretty sure but I'm

1212.6 --> 1217.8799999999999
not entirely certain that there is a

1214.94 --> 1219.5
great chance that at the top this what

1217.88 --> 1221.5390000000002
people call the firmament we don't know

1219.5 --> 1225.74
what it I think it's a flat top that

1221.539 --> 1229.34
that is actually a cold element

1225.74 --> 1230.48
and then you have well the exact

1229.34 --> 1233.36
gradient

1230.48 --> 1235.88
basically the elements that are required

1233.36 --> 1238.34
for that scenario to take place right

1235.88 --> 1243.3200000000002
Heat at ground level cold at the top

1238.34 --> 1244.6999999999998
gradient there you go okay I I respect

1243.32 --> 1248.299
your your your your your your your

1244.7 --> 1250.28
vision on on on that particular subject

1248.299 --> 1252.2
I I don't I don't believe that's the

1250.28 --> 1255.32
case but you know let's move on to

1252.2 --> 1257.78
something else though correct um

1255.32 --> 1260.78
um so

1257.78 --> 1263.78
what I've always wondered right

1260.78 --> 1266.059
if if what you if you what you say is

1263.78 --> 1269.1789999999999
true right if the Earth indeed is flat

1266.059 --> 1270.98
and and we and and we live on a you know

1269.179 --> 1273.5590000000002
whatever it is

1270.98 --> 1275.299
on a flat plane ah yeah uh something

1273.559 --> 1277.3999999999999
flat whatever it is it's flat and it's

1275.299 --> 1281.059
not a ball right it's not it's just

1277.4 --> 1285.26
we're on the ground like I see the Earth

1281.059 --> 1287.36
not as a disc of some kind I see it as a

1285.26 --> 1292.28
container it's like

1287.36 --> 1295.3999999999999
a gigantic rectangular Cube but it's

1292.28 --> 1297.44
it's basically some kind of a box but

1295.4 --> 1299.24
how that works exactly I don't know

1297.44 --> 1301.039
because I don't know the dimensions of

1299.24 --> 1303.38
the box and I suspect that there is

1301.039 --> 1307.76
really weird non-spatial non-linearity

1303.38 --> 1310.46
effects happening that that like a loop

1307.76 --> 1313.039
so it's a really weird contained realm

1310.46 --> 1315.44
it's a realm where inside of it and

1313.039 --> 1316.58
we're standing on the ground which is at

1315.44 --> 1318.8600000000001
the yeah

1316.58 --> 1321.559
then why is this thing that we where we

1318.86 --> 1323.6
live in why is this unique to to

1321.559 --> 1326.12
specifically this and why are all the

1323.6 --> 1328.76
other things uh the other things flat

1326.12 --> 1330.799
what other things well not the other

1328.76 --> 1333.1
planets bars Oh you mean the lights in

1330.799 --> 1333.1
the sky

1334.9 --> 1339.919
they're not planets well they are well

1337.82 --> 1343.039
what is a planet planet is a Wandering

1339.919 --> 1345.26
Star right you have to fix Stars you

1343.039 --> 1348.14
have the Sun and the Moon and then you

1345.26 --> 1350.419
have the wandering stars and those are

1348.14 --> 1351.7990000000002
planets and those are always there just

1350.419 --> 1352.7
like all the other stars are always

1351.799 --> 1355.94
there

1352.7 --> 1359.6000000000001
but these little things are weirder than

1355.94 --> 1362.24
Stars they have Unique Images just like

1359.6 --> 1364.4599999999998
the moon very unique okay wait wait wait

1362.24 --> 1365.72
I'll back up a little bit

1364.46 --> 1368.96
um so

1365.72 --> 1371.3600000000001
when the solar system formed right yeah

1368.96 --> 1374.6000000000001
it was a blown up but that's okay wait

1371.36 --> 1378.2199999999998
uh that's that's Helia Center okay but

1374.6 --> 1380.26
are are you trying to inquire about

1378.22 --> 1383.3600000000001
heliocentrism or are you trying to

1380.26 --> 1385.58
figure out how to figure out why we are

1383.36 --> 1387.3799999999999
unique like okay so why difference

1385.58 --> 1390.3799999999999
there's a difference okay philosophy is

1387.38 --> 1393.0200000000002
like now I I understand that there's a

1390.38 --> 1396.3200000000002
fundamental difference in how you think

1393.02 --> 1398.36
space is constructed as what I think

1396.32 --> 1400.3999999999999
space is made of or not what space is

1398.36 --> 1402.74
made of or what what it contains right

1400.4 --> 1405.799
so it's very hard to

1402.74 --> 1409.78
um for me to give examples if if we

1405.799 --> 1412.82
don't agree on on the parameters of this

1409.78 --> 1415.76
world that I'm trying to explain like my

1412.82 --> 1419.1789999999999
side of it so what I'm trying to say is

1415.76 --> 1421.1
um or what my question was is why why is

1419.179 --> 1423.44
this unique why is the shape of the

1421.1 --> 1425.84
thing we live on unique and all the

1423.44 --> 1430.46
other planets are not I'm saying that

1425.84 --> 1432.039
because to me you know uh uh like what

1430.46 --> 1435.32
is uh

1432.039 --> 1437.6589999999999
what's that mainstreamly accepted is

1435.32 --> 1441.08
that there was a protoplanetary disk and

1437.659 --> 1444.0200000000002
and thus coalesce and planets form so

1441.08 --> 1446.059
that's for me that has been how it's

1444.02 --> 1450.02
been since I was a little kid you know

1446.059 --> 1452.0
like yeah what I've known for me to me

1450.02 --> 1453.74
all this sounds logical for me it sounds

1452.0 --> 1456.38
logical there's planets there's like

1453.74 --> 1458.24
there's smaller ones that are close to

1456.38 --> 1460.22
the Sun there's other ones like the big

1458.24 --> 1463.159
ones the big giant ones that are further

1460.22 --> 1466.1000000000001
out and it all evolves around each other

1463.159 --> 1467.7800000000002
just you know gravity I'm doing air

1466.1 --> 1471.02
quotes I'm not on screen but I'm doing

1467.78 --> 1472.7
other quotes and um yeah no but look if

1471.02 --> 1474.98
you're gonna go by that standard then

1472.7 --> 1476.679
there is there has to be gravity I I

1474.98 --> 1478.46
sorry to break it to you but

1476.679 --> 1481.94
heliocentrism cannot work without

1478.46 --> 1484.52
gravity like it doesn't have any physics

1481.94 --> 1486.679
explanations without it the problem is

1484.52 --> 1489.26
and that is where the typical flat

1486.679 --> 1492.02
earthers get on everybody's nerves is

1489.26 --> 1494.26
that it's just not doesn't exist the

1492.02 --> 1497.48
whole point is is that that entire story

1494.26 --> 1499.22
of outer space and the universe and the

1497.48 --> 1502.039
guy Galaxy forming it's all really

1499.22 --> 1505.28
amazing with beautiful pictures created

1502.039 --> 1508.1
by artists and even some of it might

1505.28 --> 1511.039
even be partially inspired on telescope

1508.1 --> 1513.32
sites right but the thing is is that

1511.039 --> 1515.6
there is absolutely no proof whatsoever

1513.32 --> 1519.08
that those are physical places in

1515.6 --> 1521.299
euclidean space at all motivation is

1519.08 --> 1525.02
what's the motive the motivation is that

1521.299 --> 1527.6589999999999
they have an amazing gigantic story

1525.02 --> 1529.8799999999999
like a storyboard that will last forever

1527.659 --> 1533.179
because it is the origin of life itself

1529.88 --> 1535.94
it's a theater that nobody knows as a

1533.179 --> 1538.7
theater that they can use to play with

1535.94 --> 1540.919
us forever and even like get a super

1538.7 --> 1542.9
enthusiastic to throw giant piles of

1540.919 --> 1545.3200000000002
money at them for something that isn't

1542.9 --> 1545.3200000000002
even real

1545.419 --> 1551.6000000000001
but you know so if if there's so many

1548.659 --> 1554.0
people in that conspiracy right so if

1551.6 --> 1556.279
there's so many people upholding this

1554.0 --> 1558.26
there's not that many

1556.279 --> 1560.059
but it will it would require because

1558.26 --> 1562.1589999999999
it's self-guiding

1560.059 --> 1564.26
it's their whole religion is

1562.159 --> 1566.0
self-guiding you believe in it and then

1564.26 --> 1568.8799999999999
you invest in it and you get others to

1566.0 --> 1571.7
believe in it right people that are in

1568.88 --> 1573.5590000000002
religious cults okay especially in the

1571.7 --> 1574.94
start they don't know it's a cult they

1573.559 --> 1576.6789999999999
think they're doing something great they

1574.94 --> 1578.1200000000001
think they're part of something big and

1576.679 --> 1579.98
they want to get other people into it

1578.12 --> 1583.52
that's exactly what the globe does too

1579.98 --> 1585.44
okay so hold on for a second let me let

1583.52 --> 1587.24
me try to explain a a thing right that's

1585.44 --> 1588.44
okay so I understand what you're what

1587.24 --> 1589.76
you're saying so we've been

1588.44 --> 1593.1200000000001
indoctrinated

1589.76 --> 1594.52
for a long time and from the get-go in

1593.12 --> 1598.1
schools

1594.52 --> 1600.74
from your point of view what we we are

1598.1 --> 1602.779
taught is not correct right so we are

1600.74 --> 1604.1
being taught that uh we live in a

1602.779 --> 1606.08
universe there's other planets there's

1604.1 --> 1609.6789999999999
gravity all that all that it's just a

1606.08 --> 1610.6399999999999
story so people grow up thinking that

1609.679 --> 1612.919
right

1610.64 --> 1614.779
some of them might become a Pianist some

1612.919 --> 1616.8200000000002
of them might become I don't know I.T

1614.779 --> 1618.919
Specialists and some of them will

1616.82 --> 1621.74
interest themselves in what they've

1618.919 --> 1623.659
learned about space so by themselves

1621.74 --> 1626.059
they're going to try and research they

1623.659 --> 1630.5590000000002
might buy a telescope or they might go

1626.059 --> 1632.6
to a university and and study astronomy

1630.559 --> 1634.6399999999999
um that's not a good example because

1632.6 --> 1636.9399999999998
that would require the universe which is

1634.64 --> 1641.2990000000002
already indoctrinated and giving more

1636.94 --> 1642.74
lies air quotes again right so if these

1641.299 --> 1643.82
people and there's a lot of people in

1642.74 --> 1645.44
the world there's a lot of people in

1643.82 --> 1648.6399999999999
different countries that have the

1645.44 --> 1651.679
opportunity to study stuff by themselves

1648.64 --> 1654.74
don't you think that at a certain point

1651.679 --> 1657.46
somebody would discover like dude what

1654.74 --> 1661.1
that I'm not talking about flat earthers

1657.46 --> 1664.46
I am talking about flat earthers but the

1661.1 --> 1668.24
point where I'm getting at is

1664.46 --> 1671.48
um does the Flat Earth how do I explain

1668.24 --> 1674.419
this how do I explain this like how

1671.48 --> 1675.98
well it's exactly what I'm saying where

1674.419 --> 1677.96
are the people that are

1675.98 --> 1679.7
contradict aside from the Flat Earth

1677.96 --> 1682.22
there's like people that are actually

1679.7 --> 1684.559
inside of there figuring out that it's

1682.22 --> 1686.96
all yeah yeah I mean well they're there

1684.559 --> 1688.76
and the ones that speak out let me let

1686.96 --> 1691.1000000000001
me let me just round this out because

1688.76 --> 1693.86
you're taking very long to ask that

1691.1 --> 1696.32
question they are there they are there

1693.86 --> 1699.62
and those that can't handle it or don't

1696.32 --> 1701.1789999999999
realize that we're really into it really

1699.62 --> 1703.279
thought it was all real and that just

1701.179 --> 1705.44
discover is fake and then start harping

1703.279 --> 1707.179
on about it now guess what they get into

1705.44 --> 1709.039
trouble they get faced with hey yeah

1707.179 --> 1711.5800000000002
you're gonna drop this or you're fired

1709.039 --> 1715.039
with all the benefits right because

1711.58 --> 1718.22
those people with that equipment they

1715.039 --> 1720.98
that's a good salary right it's all

1718.22 --> 1723.46
money it's freaking money dude

1720.98 --> 1726.679
well yeah no that is true like the world

1723.46 --> 1728.779
those people that is true eventually

1726.679 --> 1731.3600000000001
only the ones that are just gonna go

1728.779 --> 1733.039
with whatever they're said they're gonna

1731.36 --> 1735.62
have to say are gonna be there because

1733.039 --> 1738.3799999999999
the rest is just gonna be fired

1735.62 --> 1739.6399999999999
and nobody will ever know about them or

1738.38 --> 1741.8600000000001
maybe they'll write a book or something

1739.64 --> 1744.7990000000002
but yeah it's just the B system just

1741.86 --> 1747.1999999999998
keeps those people kind of in a corner

1744.799 --> 1749.179
so that it doesn't hit World

1747.2 --> 1751.88
Consciousness as much except for those

1749.179 --> 1754.88
that dig for it themselves

1751.88 --> 1757.279
right right okay so to answer one of the

1754.88 --> 1760.46
viewers question right I see tarot

1757.279 --> 1762.799
asking do you think NASA images of the

1760.46 --> 1764.96
Moon and Earth in the background are

1762.799 --> 1766.399
cartoons or do you think it's legit real

1764.96 --> 1769.039
well

1766.399 --> 1770.899
I think the ones they took on film back

1769.039 --> 1773.72
in the 60s I think those are real

1770.899 --> 1775.1
because CGI didn't exist then right so

1773.72 --> 1777.26
they could airbrush the whole thing

1775.1 --> 1781.1589999999999
obviously you can think of a multitude

1777.26 --> 1783.98
of reasons why uh they or how they could

1781.159 --> 1786.0200000000002
take those pictures right now yeah it

1783.98 --> 1787.94
doesn't existing what anything you see

1786.02 --> 1790.94
on on a computer right now anything you

1787.94 --> 1793.46
see anywhere could be fake because you

1790.94 --> 1796.76
know any any type of CGI they can make

1793.46 --> 1800.059
now is so realistic but I I yeah but

1796.76 --> 1802.76
there was CGI back then I I do think the

1800.059 --> 1804.32
the pictures they made on film back then

1802.76 --> 1806.12
and even even the things because you

1804.32 --> 1808.279
know after all I I'm not a flat Earth

1806.12 --> 1809.84
pictures they make for instance that

1808.279 --> 1811.279
Artemis thing that Artemis thing that

1809.84 --> 1814.22
went to the moon and circle the moon

1811.279 --> 1817.1
went back and the video feed and I

1814.22 --> 1818.8990000000001
obviously know that you know you think

1817.1 --> 1821.299
differently about those but

1818.899 --> 1823.4599999999998
for me I don't I don't see why they

1821.299 --> 1825.44
should fake that for me yeah I do

1823.46 --> 1828.08
believe those those are real good okay

1825.44 --> 1829.5800000000002
you know I I don't see anything wrong

1828.08 --> 1831.799
with that no

1829.58 --> 1834.6789999999999
all right but you said that there was no

1831.799 --> 1835.82
CGI that's incorrect there definitely

1834.679 --> 1838.279
was

1835.82 --> 1841.399
yeah yeah in the 60s yeah yeah they used

1838.279 --> 1843.74
freaking super high-tech computers for

1841.399 --> 1845.9599999999998
that [ __ ] that were massive would take

1843.74 --> 1850.52
up like buildings

1845.96 --> 1853.46
to do actual 3D renderings back then

1850.52 --> 1855.9189999999999
like it was super Proto it was secret

1853.46 --> 1858.679
that's the [ __ ] that NASA was actually

1855.919 --> 1860.72
doing they were developing future

1858.679 --> 1865.76
computer

1860.72 --> 1867.2
technology and also okay the idea of a

1865.76 --> 1869.72
sphere

1867.2 --> 1871.76
that was basically their their objective

1869.72 --> 1874.7
let's let's you know let's invest all

1871.76 --> 1876.32
that money into this computer this state

1874.7 --> 1878.659
of the article yeah let's set up this

1876.32 --> 1880.7
culture let's set up this culture where

1878.659 --> 1882.679
we are the priesthood and everybody's

1880.7 --> 1884.6000000000001
going to be dependent on us for the

1882.679 --> 1886.3400000000001
evidence of their belief that they want

1884.6 --> 1888.62
to believe in because people want to

1886.34 --> 1891.799
believe this fantastic thing that we can

1888.62 --> 1893.84
be all futuristic in spaceships in our

1891.799 --> 1896.779
space and teleport like on Star Trek

1893.84 --> 1900.32
everybody wants that oh I love Star Trek

1896.779 --> 1904.7
yeah um right so people want it to be

1900.32 --> 1906.3799999999999
real they're there to reinforce reassure

1904.7 --> 1907.94
that it is real and it's really weird

1906.38 --> 1911.419
what they've been doing recently because

1907.94 --> 1914.1200000000001
now they're just goofing around like

1911.419 --> 1916.5200000000002
they don't want to do it anymore but it

1914.12 --> 1918.5
didn't used to be like that no but no

1916.52 --> 1920.6589999999999
well if it didn't used to be like let's

1918.5 --> 1921.98
go back to the past like far far in the

1920.659 --> 1924.98
past let's go back to like for instance

1921.98 --> 1926.539
these Sumerians right okay if the

1924.98 --> 1929.84
Sumerians not have

1926.539 --> 1933.02
a chart of the planets and Earth did

1929.84 --> 1935.4189999999999
they not predict positions of planets

1933.02 --> 1939.1399999999999
correct did they not of course astrology

1935.419 --> 1941.419
astrology is ancient but did they also

1939.14 --> 1944.179
that's astrology though not astronomy

1941.419 --> 1948.0800000000002
it's astrology it's knowing how the

1944.179 --> 1950.8990000000001
planet paths work and how the Stars work

1948.08 --> 1954.34
the seasons in relation to it so the

1950.899 --> 1957.08
Sumerians knew that um

1954.34 --> 1959.0
Sirius the star series was a double star

1957.08 --> 1960.86
for example well you know now we're

1959.0 --> 1962.24
going to go frame science because

1960.86 --> 1963.6789999999999
there's a lot of things that I don't

1962.24 --> 1965.779
believe which you do believe but there's

1963.679 --> 1968.419
a lot of crazy [ __ ] that I do believe

1965.779 --> 1970.039
which a lot of people think that's what

1968.419 --> 1971.8400000000001
I'm saying what exactly is this crazy

1970.039 --> 1973.7
[ __ ] that I believe that you don't

1971.84 --> 1977.1789999999999
believe you keep saying that but it's

1973.7 --> 1979.76
very vague uh no yeah the whole ancient

1977.179 --> 1982.7
alien Theory what

1979.76 --> 1984.44
uh okay so I'm I don't believe that I'm

1982.7 --> 1987.679
jumping subjects right now okay so

1984.44 --> 1989.72
there's where where people in my circles

1987.679 --> 1991.8200000000002
think that sometimes I say sound things

1989.72 --> 1994.76
and sometimes I say complete batshit

1991.82 --> 1997.76
crazy things but uh this this okay so

1994.76 --> 2000.8799999999999
let me go back a couple steps right I do

1997.76 --> 2003.419
believe that certain mood images were

2000.88 --> 2007.419
faked but not because

2003.419 --> 2008.8600000000001
uh they wanted to hide

2007.419 --> 2014.44
um the shape of the planet or anything

2008.86 --> 2017.1399999999999
right so I do believe for example what

2014.44 --> 2019.8990000000001
Graeme Hancock said in his uh Netflix

2017.14 --> 2022.779
documentary about

2019.899 --> 2026.799
um a civilization uh

2022.779 --> 2029.26
having lived on the planet before

2026.799 --> 2031.5
11 600 BC

2029.26 --> 2035.14
now that they were pretty advanced

2031.5 --> 2036.94
and uh that they knew a lot about the

2035.14 --> 2039.94
stars and the planets right

2036.94 --> 2041.799
so to come back to the whole you know

2039.94 --> 2043.779
shape of the earth thing like if in

2041.799 --> 2046.059
ancient times different civilizations

2043.779 --> 2049.54
made the same predictions about

2046.059 --> 2052.06
positions of of planets and stars

2049.54 --> 2054.52
if they came to the same conclusion on

2052.06 --> 2058.119
their own separate from our civilization

2054.52 --> 2060.04
yeah but angular positions let's just be

2058.119 --> 2061.96
clear they they knew the angular

2060.04 --> 2065.139
positions because when you're talking

2061.96 --> 2067.419
positions in relation to the Galaxy then

2065.139 --> 2069.58
you're actually making a euclidean claim

2067.419 --> 2071.08
in space yeah they don't know that

2069.58 --> 2073.659
right

2071.08 --> 2076.839
they know the angular positions of the

2073.659 --> 2078.82
stars in relation to the cycles of Earth

2076.839 --> 2080.619
and the seasons and the positions of the

2078.82 --> 2082.839
planets and they can even backtrack

2080.619 --> 2085.3
Through Math where they're gonna be

2082.839 --> 2087.399
right in order to predict events

2085.3 --> 2090.04
celestial events is what that's called

2087.399 --> 2092.5
right that's all astrology there's no

2090.04 --> 2095.679
Assumption of any of those lights being

2092.5 --> 2097.599
physical objects but that's what they

2095.679 --> 2099.94
thought no that's not what they thought

2097.599 --> 2102.339
I guarantee it that they did not think

2099.94 --> 2105.339
that [ __ ]

2102.339 --> 2107.32
that's all modern that entire idea of

2105.339 --> 2110.14
those being even physical objects you

2107.32 --> 2111.76
know when that roughly arrived 19th

2110.14 --> 2115.18
century

2111.76 --> 2117.1600000000003
wait wait go back upstairs 19th century

2115.18 --> 2119.52
the idea is that those things are even

2117.16 --> 2119.52
physical

2120.64 --> 2124.48
yeah is that so yeah because they're

2122.859 --> 2127.119
just lights there always have been

2124.48 --> 2129.94
lights what about Galileo did he not

2127.119 --> 2131.8
yeah that's that's literally made up in

2129.94 --> 2133.839
the 19th century you know how much

2131.8 --> 2137.44
history has been made up about the past

2133.839 --> 2140.859
things that are like provably not

2137.44 --> 2142.599
logically there like aristotonies the

2140.859 --> 2145.119
proof of aristotonies was somebody

2142.599 --> 2147.4
writing a book about him

2145.119 --> 2151.06
but that guy that wrote a book about him

2147.4 --> 2154.06
wrote that book before he was born

2151.06 --> 2156.94
and you can lit we literally you asked

2154.06 --> 2159.16
the chat GPT right it'll tell you and it

2156.94 --> 2161.2000000000003
will not understand right a lot of

2159.16 --> 2164.44
evidence out there of supposed figures

2161.2 --> 2167.2
in the past have been made up I I'll

2164.44 --> 2168.94
know I know by who by freaking Jesuits

2167.2 --> 2172.0
so their specialty

2168.94 --> 2174.46
foraging history

2172.0 --> 2176.02
to support narrative they did it with

2174.46 --> 2178.7200000000003
religion

2176.02 --> 2181.66
and they do it with this new religion

2178.72 --> 2183.2799999999997
too they have been since it was the plan

2181.66 --> 2186.2799999999997
to make this the world religion

2183.28 --> 2188.619
literally literally world religion I I

2186.28 --> 2191.5600000000004
do know that history is is written by

2188.619 --> 2194.079
the Victor but that's usually in in like

2191.56 --> 2195.82
in a political sense I I'm not sure how

2194.079 --> 2197.82
far that goes with with scientific

2195.82 --> 2200.8590000000004
things especially

2197.82 --> 2205.1800000000003
uh since you know

2200.859 --> 2207.54
um over time people will tend to confirm

2205.18 --> 2211.2
scientific things with the advance of

2207.54 --> 2214.3
technological evolution

2211.2 --> 2217.18
technological Evolution okay

2214.3 --> 2220.8390000000004
well well yeah like I I do believe that

2217.18 --> 2222.52
if I have a telescope and it's it's an

2220.839 --> 2224.5
optical test it's not like some digital

2222.52 --> 2227.099
thing right and I point it at for

2224.5 --> 2227.099
example the Moon

2227.2 --> 2231.16
if I look through a telescope at the

2229.24 --> 2233.7999999999997
moon for me it's pretty clear that it's

2231.16 --> 2236.44
it's it's uh it's an object with mass

2233.8 --> 2238.2400000000002
it's for me it's Mass so I don't no you

2236.44 --> 2241.3
it might look like an object with that

2238.24 --> 2244.5989999999997
whole mess there's no reason to you

2241.3 --> 2247.7200000000003
don't have any clue of mass it's like

2244.599 --> 2250.119
how how do how else do we have tides

2247.72 --> 2251.7999999999997
uh well not through the moon because if

2250.119 --> 2254.38
the moon were actually to guide the

2251.8 --> 2258.579
tides then first off there would be only

2254.38 --> 2260.7400000000002
one tide a day and this has even been

2258.579 --> 2263.6800000000003
modeled by Neil deGrasse Tyson himself

2260.74 --> 2266.2
he showed us what would happen literally

2263.68 --> 2268.359
a giant you would get uh

2266.2 --> 2271.06
uh what's it called again Miller's

2268.359 --> 2273.94
Planet situation with the giant flood

2271.06 --> 2277.2999999999997
wave that goes around the Earth every 24

2273.94 --> 2279.4
hours or so yeah that is what the world

2277.3 --> 2283.42
would be like if the moon would actually

2279.4 --> 2285.4
cause a tidal situation like a tight a

2283.42 --> 2287.14
giant bulge of water would be pulled

2285.4 --> 2290.079
continually over the Earth there would

2287.14 --> 2292.359
be no life on the surface maybe some

2290.079 --> 2295.1800000000003
fish that are riding that wave and

2292.359 --> 2296.7999999999997
that's about it right it's it isn't

2295.18 --> 2299.56
there there's tights two times a day

2296.8 --> 2301.48
some places three yeah that makes

2299.56 --> 2304.72
absolutely no sense also there's places

2301.48 --> 2306.88
where there's no tides at all in the

2304.72 --> 2308.98
same open ocean and if you look at the

2306.88 --> 2310.359
tide map there is a tide you can look

2308.98 --> 2313.42
this up on Google if you could just

2310.359 --> 2315.16
Google tide map there's like animations

2313.42 --> 2317.56
that show you exactly where the tides

2315.16 --> 2319.98
happen over the day and how it's a bunch

2317.56 --> 2323.5
of swirls I call them Angel spoons

2319.98 --> 2325.839
comedically perhaps because it's locally

2323.5 --> 2326.68
it's like a magnetic effect that just

2325.839 --> 2329.44
keeps

2326.68 --> 2331.7799999999997
stirring that [ __ ] locally in certain

2329.44 --> 2334.78
places usually places that are extremely

2331.78 --> 2336.579
iron rich so it's a magnetic effect of

2334.78 --> 2338.8590000000004
some kind that is local it has

2336.579 --> 2341.079
absolutely nothing to do with the

2338.859 --> 2342.2799999999997
angular position of the moon in relation

2341.079 --> 2344.5
to the Earth

2342.28 --> 2347.38
when it is supposedly right above right

2344.5 --> 2349.72
it doesn't have anything to do with that

2347.38 --> 2352.06
at all I don't think it's just the moon

2349.72 --> 2355.4199999999996
though I think the sun has as a part in

2352.06 --> 2358.359
in in in you know have an effect on the

2355.42 --> 2362.02
taxes that's cute but that's not part of

2358.359 --> 2364.66
the heliocentric belief about it so

2362.02 --> 2367.119
it does it's too far away it keeps it in

2364.66 --> 2368.3799999999997
orbit but it doesn't have any pulling

2367.119 --> 2371.32
effect

2368.38 --> 2373.78
okay according to heliocentrism I know

2371.32 --> 2376.44
but I still think it's weird though that

2373.78 --> 2379.3590000000004
if if you know if this is a huge

2376.44 --> 2381.76
conspiracy that

2379.359 --> 2383.7999999999997
well you know it's it's a difficult

2381.76 --> 2385.3
thing it's more difficult than I thought

2383.8 --> 2386.7400000000002
actually going into this I thought it

2385.3 --> 2389.6800000000003
would be a little bit easier to explain

2386.74 --> 2391.06
my my my side of my story but I didn't

2389.68 --> 2394.54
prepare anything I just went no no no

2391.06 --> 2397.0789999999997
it's okay it's difficult but I see that

2394.54 --> 2399.52
you have elaborate ideas from

2397.079 --> 2401.7400000000002
heliocentrism and I used to have that

2399.52 --> 2404.5
myself I worked on the whole origin

2401.74 --> 2406.5989999999997
situation of I've developed ideas about

2404.5 --> 2408.88
like yeah if they if there's a big bang

2406.599 --> 2411.2200000000003
that's totally illogical it has to be a

2408.88 --> 2414.7000000000003
reoccurring Big Bang like an engine

2411.22 --> 2417.16
explodes contracts again black hole

2414.7 --> 2419.02
again uh yeah that's what I like right

2417.16 --> 2421.54
that sort of thing and I would I have

2419.02 --> 2424.42
those ideas too the difference is I know

2421.54 --> 2427.0
now that it's all conceptual and still

2424.42 --> 2429.16
very interesting like a science fiction

2427.0 --> 2431.26
book is very interesting or like Lord of

2429.16 --> 2433.8999999999996
the Rings universe is very interesting

2431.26 --> 2436.0
it's close to my heart and it will

2433.9 --> 2438.2200000000003
always be there even though I know it's

2436.0 --> 2439.66
not physically literal and not some

2438.22 --> 2442.839
literal history

2439.66 --> 2445.5989999999997
right it's a world in our minds and we

2442.839 --> 2448.9
can have that we can have our dreams but

2445.599 --> 2450.82
this thing is not actually real we're

2448.9 --> 2452.44
all being fooled continually with this

2450.82 --> 2455.8590000000004
including the people that really believe

2452.44 --> 2458.8
in it so that's not even if they're not

2455.859 --> 2460.0
bad people they're not bad because they

2458.8 --> 2462.3390000000004
believe in it

2460.0 --> 2465.04
right yeah it's a belief it's just like

2462.339 --> 2467.0789999999997
oh this is this religion of some kind is

2465.04 --> 2469.119
really weird okay but they're really

2467.079 --> 2472.3
nice people and they don't they they

2469.119 --> 2475.42
basically keep stick to natural law they

2472.3 --> 2477.1600000000003
don't like pred go predatory on on

2475.42 --> 2478.78
people that don't believe right so

2477.16 --> 2480.52
what's the harm then even though they

2478.78 --> 2483.7200000000003
think they're really weird about it

2480.52 --> 2483.72
that's okay right

2485.22 --> 2490.06
that's how I see it that's how I see the

2487.96 --> 2493.0
globe it's just really dominant and

2490.06 --> 2495.16
there's a predatory group that are like

2493.0 --> 2496.9
that are weaponizing it

2495.16 --> 2498.64
they have weaponized it but they're

2496.9 --> 2500.7400000000002
weaponizing everything and you know all

2498.64 --> 2503.5
about that it's very upfront right now

2500.74 --> 2507.52
in the world those same people

2503.5 --> 2509.619
weaponize this it didn't really it used

2507.52 --> 2512.079
to be kind of free-flowing it used to be

2509.619 --> 2513.579
like a creative open unit that why the

2512.079 --> 2516.46
[ __ ] do you think was such a hippie

2513.579 --> 2519.46
Revolution when it all happened it was

2516.46 --> 2522.64
it's like oh fantasy world like people

2519.46 --> 2525.339
kind of knew of most hippies at back

2522.64 --> 2527.44
then they didn't believe that was real

2525.339 --> 2529.359
they thought it's like this amazing

2527.44 --> 2532.96
storytelling time

2529.359 --> 2534.8199999999997
right and then it got all more

2532.96 --> 2537.16
aggressive more and more aggressive

2534.82 --> 2539.5
forced on children they were taught

2537.16 --> 2540.94
psychological tactics

2539.5 --> 2543.579
suddenly

2540.94 --> 2545.2200000000003
the children on top of the globe lore

2543.579 --> 2547.6600000000003
and how like how to deal with

2545.22 --> 2549.2799999999997
unbelievers or people that aren't

2547.66 --> 2552.5789999999997
science they're archaic or they're

2549.28 --> 2553.9
stupid right that's what it's become is

2552.579 --> 2556.96
weaponized

2553.9 --> 2559.6600000000003
didn't start out like that no no I yeah

2556.96 --> 2561.28
no obviously you know nowadays you know

2559.66 --> 2564.16
what what governments and and

2561.28 --> 2566.5
institutions are telling us yeah there's

2564.16 --> 2567.64
a lot of lives going on for sure I I can

2566.5 --> 2569.98
agree on that

2567.64 --> 2571.54
it's just the shape of the earth I don't

2569.98 --> 2574.0
agree with you on but yeah well no

2571.54 --> 2575.8
there's famous quotes about that right

2574.0 --> 2578.619
a small lie

2575.8 --> 2581.5600000000004
is very easily figured out but the

2578.619 --> 2584.44
really big ones you can usually get away

2581.56 --> 2586.119
with that why because it's too big for

2584.44 --> 2589.18
everybody

2586.119 --> 2591.7000000000003
like people really big ones people

2589.18 --> 2593.98
basically have to completely flip their

2591.7 --> 2596.0989999999997
lives inside out to deal with it and

2593.98 --> 2598.66
guess what guess what flat earthers do

2596.099 --> 2600.94
exactly that we have to we have no

2598.66 --> 2602.98
choice if you want to come out for Flat

2600.94 --> 2606.64
Earth your life is over

2602.98 --> 2609.28
it really is socially it is over

2606.64 --> 2611.7999999999997
and you have to completely re-get your

2609.28 --> 2614.8
bearings figure out what what social

2611.8 --> 2616.54
life even is and what the world is like

2614.8 --> 2618.4
you're very vocal about the Flat Earth

2616.54 --> 2620.44
then then yeah it might cause problems

2618.4 --> 2622.119
seeing the social standards of of

2620.44 --> 2624.4
nowadays but I'm not even talking about

2622.119 --> 2626.26
Focus hold on hold on it's not even

2624.4 --> 2629.079
talking about vocal in face-to-face

2626.26 --> 2632.44
situations I'm talking about officially

2629.079 --> 2634.599
on record saying like I'm with fla I

2632.44 --> 2636.0
believe the Earth is flat on camera

2634.599 --> 2638.56
sometimes

2636.0 --> 2640.48
that sort of thing I believe anybody

2638.56 --> 2643.0
should be able to say whatever they want

2640.48 --> 2644.859
as long as you're not you know hurting

2643.0 --> 2646.66
anybody or degrading anybody right so

2644.859 --> 2647.859
you know I I don't give a [ __ ] but

2646.66 --> 2649.2999999999997
that's so yeah but now you're talking

2647.859 --> 2652.48
hold on I'm you're talking about

2649.3 --> 2655.48
socially acceptable things right people

2652.48 --> 2656.859
can accept others are flat earthers a

2655.48 --> 2658.66
lot right but I'm not talking about

2656.859 --> 2664.06
talking about that there's a beast

2658.66 --> 2665.859
system I keeping profile of everyone it

2664.06 --> 2668.7999999999997
through metadata and other things and

2665.859 --> 2671.2599999999998
just registries right and like the

2668.8 --> 2673.119
papers people just fill in and just

2671.26 --> 2674.5
through conversations all kinds of

2673.119 --> 2677.02
things that they know about you they

2674.5 --> 2679.54
keep track as soon as you like come out

2677.02 --> 2681.64
openly for Flat Earth you're marked you

2679.54 --> 2684.24
get marked you really do and that's

2681.64 --> 2684.24
permanent

2684.28 --> 2689.8590000000004
yeah and and that's not even about

2687.819 --> 2692.68
right if you just come out like I

2689.859 --> 2694.66
believe this and I understand it then

2692.68 --> 2697.54
you get marked like if people don't even

2694.66 --> 2699.7599999999998
have to know about it right but you will

2697.54 --> 2702.46
have consequences in the system usually

2699.76 --> 2705.8190000000004
if you come out for it and there will be

2702.46 --> 2708.46
people that are really really hateful of

2705.819 --> 2711.339
that it's just in business

2708.46 --> 2713.68
in Banks and places and they will get

2711.339 --> 2716.859
you they do they will put you on Lower

2713.68 --> 2719.5
priority lists I I I think for both

2716.859 --> 2720.7599999999998
sides though it's a it in the in the

2719.5 --> 2722.38
last couple of years for some people

2720.76 --> 2724.599
it's become a revenue model right

2722.38 --> 2728.2000000000003
there's people that make money uh on

2724.599 --> 2730.3
both sides trying to both sides well

2728.2 --> 2732.3999999999996
yeah like that aren't there flat

2730.3 --> 2733.96
earthers that have a lot of followers or

2732.4 --> 2736.7200000000003
I don't know how YouTube Works actually

2733.96 --> 2739.18
with minute if you compare this to the

2736.72 --> 2741.52
big guys on YouTube dude we're nothing

2739.18 --> 2744.04
there's people with millions of

2741.52 --> 2747.7
subscribers that makes like Millions a

2744.04 --> 2750.04
day just from freaking Revenue thrown at

2747.7 --> 2752.56
them dude so if you if you if your

2750.04 --> 2754.7799999999997
biggest flat earther is like a couple of

2752.56 --> 2757.06
hundred thousand if you if you talk

2754.78 --> 2759.28
about Flat Earth do they demonetize you

2757.06 --> 2762.94
I wonder

2759.28 --> 2765.88
no okay so so they're not not like that

2762.94 --> 2767.98
like uh no they only demonetize when you

2765.88 --> 2769.96
get involved in like political [ __ ] and

2767.98 --> 2772.48
all that yeah political [ __ ] nudity

2769.96 --> 2774.579
violence that kind of [ __ ]

2772.48 --> 2777.52
well nudity and Vibes I don't know I

2774.579 --> 2780.3390000000004
know check that but I'm not sure I'm

2777.52 --> 2783.7599999999998
pretty sure they demonetize or why if it

2780.339 --> 2785.98
if it's really graphic then yeah but I

2783.76 --> 2788.38
mean YouTube lets people get away with a

2785.98 --> 2790.0
lot unless you're like on the wrong side

2788.38 --> 2791.8
of politics and then they don't let you

2790.0 --> 2794.2
get away with anything well yeah

2791.8 --> 2796.9
politics is a big thing because you know

2794.2 --> 2799.359
it's obvious media uses politics no the

2796.9 --> 2800.859
politics use media for for you know for

2799.359 --> 2802.66
their for their own game like that's

2800.859 --> 2804.5789999999997
that's the same thing at this point

2802.66 --> 2807.0989999999997
media has just become a political

2804.579 --> 2809.92
extension arm through Mega corporations

2807.099 --> 2811.48
let's see if because I think I saw a

2809.92 --> 2813.839
couple of questions in the in the side

2811.48 --> 2818.56
chat uh there was one oh yeah right

2813.839 --> 2821.68
gordzilla 37. he uh asked why would they

2818.56 --> 2824.2
have to fake a single thing instead it's

2821.68 --> 2826.72
all real right okay so sarcasm yeah yeah

2824.2 --> 2829.1189999999997
they're being a lot very excited in chat

2826.72 --> 2830.319
no no no yeah that's that's true I

2829.119 --> 2832.6600000000003
wanted to say something about the home

2830.319 --> 2833.98
because I I was telling you before okay

2832.66 --> 2836.0789999999997
funny thing

2833.98 --> 2837.16
um I was telling you before that I was

2836.079 --> 2840.099
saying like

2837.16 --> 2841.7799999999997
um I I do think that certain parts of uh

2840.099 --> 2845.02
okay so now she's gonna get real crazy

2841.78 --> 2847.7200000000003
right from my side uh so parts of the

2845.02 --> 2849.339
moon landings uh were were fake and the

2847.72 --> 2850.72
whole thing Stanley cubic there's a

2849.339 --> 2853.0
whole thing about Stanley Kubrick having

2850.72 --> 2854.74
a studio making like the landscape of

2853.0 --> 2858.4
the Moon all that [ __ ] all that disaster

2854.74 --> 2860.7999999999997
yeah I get that like and I've been I've

2858.4 --> 2862.1800000000003
been in in you could say indoctrinated

2860.8 --> 2863.5600000000004
in some way as well because I love

2862.18 --> 2865.54
science fiction I love anything about

2863.56 --> 2867.22
aliens I love anything about like all

2865.54 --> 2869.38
that [ __ ] right so that interests me a

2867.22 --> 2872.9199999999996
lot that's why I gravitate to the [ __ ]

2869.38 --> 2875.02
Graeme Hancock says so what I was

2872.92 --> 2877.0
thinking and this is very sci-fi but I

2875.02 --> 2879.099
just like to think about it that way so

2877.0 --> 2881.14
I think they did go to the moon and I

2879.099 --> 2883.599
think they did see [ __ ] there they

2881.14 --> 2886.18
weren't expecting and that's why they

2883.599 --> 2888.099
had to you know show the Earth

2886.18 --> 2890.02
parts of the Moon that were faked that

2888.099 --> 2891.339
had nothing on it because actually I do

2890.02 --> 2893.68
think there's a lot of [ __ ] on the moon

2891.339 --> 2895.839
that that you know we're not supposed to

2893.68 --> 2897.3999999999996
see I know you don't think that because

2895.839 --> 2899.44
you don't think the Moon is a physical

2897.4 --> 2902.46
object but well I used to think that

2899.44 --> 2905.8
before I got into Flat Earth

2902.46 --> 2908.079
for me it seems like if you think about

2905.8 --> 2909.6400000000003
it especially back in the 60s or in the

2908.079 --> 2912.94
70s or whatever the [ __ ] it was that

2909.64 --> 2915.0989999999997
they went to the moon so if you'd say

2912.94 --> 2917.619
back then right they went to the moon

2915.099 --> 2919.92
and they just entertain that thought

2917.619 --> 2922.48
they'd see Mega structures right

2919.92 --> 2925.1800000000003
indicating that there is you know

2922.48 --> 2926.7400000000002
something like an intelligence beyond

2925.18 --> 2929.9199999999996
our Earth

2926.74 --> 2932.0789999999997
religious people work back then even now

2929.92 --> 2934.119
if you'd say it now you know [ __ ] would

2932.079 --> 2936.4
hit the fan everybody would go [ __ ]

2934.119 --> 2939.76
nuts everybody would go no they wouldn't

2936.4 --> 2941.98
so that's you know I'm not super serious

2939.76 --> 2944.38
about it but no they wouldn't that's so

2941.98 --> 2946.3
90s of weird to say that you don't yeah

2944.38 --> 2948.339
they don't no this [ __ ] comes out all

2946.3 --> 2951.46
the time dude do you know what is this

2948.339 --> 2953.44
classified on a regular basis people

2951.46 --> 2956.079
don't give a [ __ ] anymore it's they

2953.44 --> 2957.64
don't trust anything no like if even if

2956.079 --> 2961.1800000000003
they believe the globe they're not gonna

2957.64 --> 2963.339
trust [ __ ] anymore except if they're

2961.18 --> 2965.5
just drugged up or something they're

2963.339 --> 2967.2999999999997
having too much fun I don't think aliens

2965.5 --> 2969.66
wanted to have anything to do with us

2967.3 --> 2971.7000000000003
because we're just a very dumb species

2969.66 --> 2974.2
what are you doing

2971.7 --> 2975.8999999999996
this is really annoying

2974.2 --> 2979.24
oh sorry

2975.9 --> 2982.619
uh okay so anything let's see if there's

2979.24 --> 2982.6189999999997
any interesting questions Maybe

2983.26 --> 2988.5400000000004
yeah but but you're still going all the

2985.42 --> 2989.98
way by premise of stories that I mean I

2988.54 --> 2991.96
used to kind of believe that I thought

2989.98 --> 2993.819
like why are they hiding the Moon from

2991.96 --> 2997.3
us they're like secretly doing their

2993.819 --> 2999.46
stuff or maybe David Ike like yeah you

2997.3 --> 3000.8390000000004
know with his hollow moon base like I

2999.46 --> 3003.2400000000002
think that from a heliocentric

3000.839 --> 3005.2799999999997
perspective there is it is interesting I

3003.24 --> 3007.02
mean yeah who knows what whatever man

3005.28 --> 3008.94
the moon even from a heliocentric

3007.02 --> 3011.64
perspective is a rock

3008.94 --> 3014.16
having that perfect orbit always facing

3011.64 --> 3016.56
the same side is super surreal and like

3014.16 --> 3019.319
mathematically impossible did you know

3016.56 --> 3021.599
that that the moon perfectly facing

3019.319 --> 3023.819
Earth in its orbit the way it does like

3021.599 --> 3026.1600000000003
forever that that is like mathematically

3023.819 --> 3029.52
impossible really

3026.16 --> 3032.66
they brag about it they brag about how

3029.52 --> 3035.46
crazy it is that it is that way oh yeah

3032.66 --> 3037.7999999999997
yeah it is a mess yeah it's a crazy that

3035.46 --> 3040.44
it is that way which is mathematically

3037.8 --> 3042.48
impossible like that could never happen

3040.44 --> 3045.54
according to the mechanical logic with

3042.48 --> 3048.8
which they have arranged their

3045.54 --> 3051.66
understanding of how everything works

3048.8 --> 3053.46
is moving away from the earth uh with

3051.66 --> 3055.0789999999997
like a couple centimeters every every

3053.46 --> 3057.78
day or every year whatever the [ __ ] to

3055.079 --> 3060.3590000000004
say about it no they might say that it's

3057.78 --> 3063.9
total horseshit because the imagery of

3060.359 --> 3066.0589999999997
the moon is exactly identical to what it

3063.9 --> 3068.28
was a hundred years ago

3066.059 --> 3070.02
and 100 years ago before that it looks

3068.28 --> 3072.1800000000003
the same it always looks the same it

3070.02 --> 3073.94
always looks exactly the same facing

3072.18 --> 3076.98
everybody exactly the same

3073.94 --> 3078.96
astronomically seen in 100 years is like

3076.98 --> 3080.76
is nothing right 100 years that wasn't

3078.96 --> 3083.46
it's not going to be a centimeter a year

3080.76 --> 3085.26
then because that is very that very much

3083.46 --> 3088.44
starts Counting

3085.26 --> 3091.079
uh like even also on astronomical terms

3088.44 --> 3093.42
a centimeter is like you know trying to

3091.079 --> 3095.3390000000004
measure an atom a centimeter doesn't

3093.42 --> 3097.2000000000003
mean anything in space right well if

3095.339 --> 3099.0589999999997
it's not measured if it's not measured

3097.2 --> 3100.7999999999997
then it's just speculatory it's like oh

3099.059 --> 3102.9
we don't live long enough to see the

3100.8 --> 3105.0
changes oh so it never changes then it's

3102.9 --> 3107.46
just a claim because it can never be

3105.0 --> 3110.52
verified because it's outside of our

3107.46 --> 3113.339
time perception and oh okay so it's

3110.52 --> 3115.46
never able to be proven then don't you

3113.339 --> 3118.02
see that

3115.46 --> 3120.38
no yeah you know I get your point they

3118.02 --> 3123.72
do that all the time right they get

3120.38 --> 3126.78
astronomical oh it's so far it's so big

3123.72 --> 3128.52
it's all oh it's so lot so long such a

3126.78 --> 3129.8390000000004
long time they couldn't comprehend we're

3128.52 --> 3132.66
just this little blip and then we're

3129.839 --> 3135.0589999999997
extinct like that is all

3132.66 --> 3137.5789999999997
to basically pull you away from being

3135.059 --> 3140.2200000000003
able to prove anything you're saying

3137.579 --> 3142.8
you see that

3140.22 --> 3144.66
yeah no I guess again I I do get your

3142.8 --> 3147.599
points like I don't have any problems

3144.66 --> 3149.819
with placing myself in somebody else

3147.599 --> 3152.819
right and and that's why I respect

3149.819 --> 3154.859
people's beliefs and and I hope people

3152.819 --> 3156.0589999999997
respect mine as well all right uh

3154.859 --> 3158.46
talking about that

3156.059 --> 3160.2000000000003
also I wonder this is not it's not

3158.46 --> 3161.64
entirely related it's more psychological

3160.2 --> 3164.04
thing but

3161.64 --> 3167.22
we were talking about this before before

3164.04 --> 3167.94
the before we went on right and talking

3167.22 --> 3170.4599999999996
about

3167.94 --> 3172.02
how it's easy to you know type [ __ ] from

3170.46 --> 3174.599
a keyboard when uh you know you're not

3172.02 --> 3177.3
faced yeah keyboard worrying uh this is

3174.599 --> 3179.339
not inherent to you know any group of

3177.3 --> 3181.8590000000004
people right but I see it in the chat

3179.339 --> 3185.339
right now like people get degrading real

3181.859 --> 3186.66
easy I wonder I wonder like why is that

3185.339 --> 3188.88
necessary right

3186.66 --> 3191.3999999999996
who's getting degrading

3188.88 --> 3193.92
no um the grading might be a big word

3191.4 --> 3196.5
but they get patronizing right they have

3193.92 --> 3199.319
they're having fun yeah yeah is that

3196.5 --> 3200.88
having fun yeah well maybe I'm just uh a

3199.319 --> 3203.339
boring and a boring person in that way

3200.88 --> 3206.1600000000003
you could now you're being sensitive

3203.339 --> 3209.2799999999997
like but we're not gonna be protective

3206.16 --> 3211.02
of your belief right true I am not

3209.28 --> 3212.7000000000003
protective of your belief either I'm

3211.02 --> 3214.859
just I don't I just don't have those

3212.7 --> 3217.02
impulses really because I don't think

3214.859 --> 3219.0589999999997
they're productive you don't get through

3217.02 --> 3220.859
you don't actually change anybody by

3219.059 --> 3223.8590000000004
being like that it is kind of group

3220.859 --> 3226.2599999999998
Behavior but flat earthers do need that

3223.859 --> 3228.9
you do realize that right we need that

3226.26 --> 3231.2400000000002
because we are super isolated it is like

3228.9 --> 3234.3
a forced Community spirit

3231.24 --> 3237.18
that binds us together because we are

3234.3 --> 3240.96
isolated that causes us to then do that

3237.18 --> 3243.5989999999997
right and look have you seen like uh

3240.96 --> 3247.2
anti-flat Earth or streams with their

3243.599 --> 3249.2400000000002
chats they're absolutely merciless

3247.2 --> 3251.3999999999996
like you can't say anything you can't

3249.24 --> 3253.5589999999997
even say an argument in there I don't

3251.4 --> 3256.26
really watch streams without I'm just

3253.559 --> 3259.26
saying like this is still very mild

3256.26 --> 3262.92
compared to how baller channels tend to

3259.26 --> 3264.599
treat flat earthers very mild

3262.92 --> 3266.28
so they're just having some fun that's

3264.599 --> 3268.04
how I'm seeing it I don't see anything

3266.28 --> 3271.099
really super harsh or anything

3268.04 --> 3274.5589999999997
threatening so they're just being like

3271.099 --> 3276.599
just having fun in the classroom so

3274.559 --> 3278.6400000000003
that's cool

3276.599 --> 3280.2000000000003
I I wouldn't take it all too perfect I

3278.64 --> 3281.819
wouldn't Focus too much on them anyway

3280.2 --> 3285.1189999999997
like we're having a good conversation

3281.819 --> 3287.7
just let them blabber in the background

3285.119 --> 3289.98
like I said I'm not a content creator

3287.7 --> 3292.0789999999997
I've never been on I've never been on

3289.98 --> 3294.059
any stream or you know have done

3292.079 --> 3297.1800000000003
anything like that I just you know

3294.059 --> 3299.0400000000004
kind of funny right well you have a

3297.18 --> 3301.9199999999996
pretty good voice for this

3299.04 --> 3304.04
and hey you're yeah I can only see you

3301.92 --> 3306.48
but you're you're not ugly

3304.04 --> 3309.72
so that's cool now but that's I'm just

3306.48 --> 3311.88
saying like you you could like you could

3309.72 --> 3313.4399999999996
do pretty well I think on the scene

3311.88 --> 3315.2400000000002
really I'm really enjoying this

3313.44 --> 3317.16
conversation and then like not trouble

3315.24 --> 3318.4199999999996
at all by you being a baller or anything

3317.16 --> 3321.0
so

3318.42 --> 3323.28
which sometimes happened but it isn't

3321.0 --> 3325.16
happening so I don't know

3323.28 --> 3328.02
I'd like to do this more often actually

3325.16 --> 3330.1189999999997
for sure yeah I'd like I like the the

3328.02 --> 3332.28
whole conversation thing as well it's

3330.119 --> 3335.099
it's just fun to think about things like

3332.28 --> 3337.44
I I think as well and that's something I

3335.099 --> 3339.119
I sometimes like

3337.44 --> 3342.0
um think about it as well with flat

3339.119 --> 3344.88
earthers right if I'd like to when I

3342.0 --> 3346.92
have a certain idea uh about something

3344.88 --> 3349.8
that might be controversial or not right

3346.92 --> 3353.819
I I I I'm one of those people that needs

3349.8 --> 3355.619
to hear every possible side of of the

3353.819 --> 3356.4
concept I'm trying to convey to certain

3355.619 --> 3358.92
people

3356.4 --> 3361.8
and uh if I surround myself with people

3358.92 --> 3363.8
that just always confirm what I am

3361.8 --> 3367.5
saying and never

3363.8 --> 3368.3390000000004
uh want to go against what I'm saying

3367.5 --> 3370.859
then

3368.339 --> 3373.38
that that doesn't really work for me

3370.859 --> 3376.02
because I need to different different

3373.38 --> 3380.2200000000003
right sides of Things Different vision

3376.02 --> 3382.559
of things can help me progress or solve

3380.22 --> 3385.4399999999996
a problem right you need you need it to

3382.559 --> 3388.1400000000003
be tested so if you're only uh

3385.44 --> 3390.7200000000003
surrounded by yaysayers then exactly

3388.14 --> 3392.52
then they're just there to let you

3390.72 --> 3394.4399999999996
ramble they're probably not even really

3392.52 --> 3397.319
listening that much so yeah yeah but

3394.44 --> 3399.66
it's very easy if that happens and you

3397.319 --> 3400.98
do have a certain theory that you know

3399.66 --> 3404.5789999999997
is

3400.98 --> 3406.859
insane then it's very hard to come out

3404.579 --> 3410.6400000000003
of that as well I think right so it's

3406.859 --> 3413.04
important to not just hear what you want

3410.64 --> 3414.839
to hear right it's also good so you know

3413.04 --> 3416.52
you hear [ __ ] you sometimes don't want

3414.839 --> 3417.359
to hear but you know it could make you

3416.52 --> 3419.579
think

3417.359 --> 3422.339
about

3419.579 --> 3424.02
you know things differently than you

3422.339 --> 3426.48
otherwise of course maybe would not

3424.02 --> 3429.0
right yeah if you don't test a dream

3426.48 --> 3431.46
then it's going to isolate you it's

3429.0 --> 3433.079
going to just cause a rift between your

3431.46 --> 3434.4
understanding of reality and everybody

3433.079 --> 3437.2200000000003
else's

3434.4 --> 3438.96
right people become like so autistic

3437.22 --> 3440.7599999999998
with that it's like no this is my idea

3438.96 --> 3442.7400000000002
and it becomes their personal religion

3440.76 --> 3446.3390000000004
and they're not open anymore

3442.74 --> 3447.7799999999997
and they bewilder because of that in the

3446.339 --> 3449.94
face of other people

3447.78 --> 3453.0
so yeah it's very important to test your

3449.94 --> 3454.68
ideas but you will often be

3453.0 --> 3456.96
just like

3454.68 --> 3459.48
completely surprised how everything

3456.96 --> 3461.2200000000003
turns out to be different on multiple

3459.48 --> 3462.26
locations throughout my life as that

3461.22 --> 3465.48
happened

3462.26 --> 3466.94
and yeah with flat Earth it was really

3465.48 --> 3470.7
bizarre because I've been like

3466.94 --> 3473.339
compartmentalized awakened with that

3470.7 --> 3476.819
but then has it helped you in other ways

3473.339 --> 3478.68
as well did you like that that that you

3476.819 --> 3480.0589999999997
know that belief in in what you have

3478.68 --> 3482.04
right now in the show you've got going

3480.059 --> 3484.26
and you know for you it's a daily thing

3482.04 --> 3486.0589999999997
believe now it's not believed to me I

3484.26 --> 3488.94
mean my beliefs

3486.059 --> 3492.48
are not about Flat Earth I have beliefs

3488.94 --> 3495.3
sure I'm much more in belief about the

3492.48 --> 3498.3
experiences that I have had trying to

3495.3 --> 3501.599
figure them out like my visions and

3498.3 --> 3504.059
uh believed about the origins like what

3501.599 --> 3507.0
is really out there like what what is

3504.059 --> 3508.619
like what is God right I mean

3507.0 --> 3512.4
everybody's like oh it's this it's that

3508.619 --> 3516.059
yeah I think it is God actual original

3512.4 --> 3518.099
Creator is beyond our comprehension and

3516.059 --> 3520.92
when I say that I literally mean that

3518.099 --> 3522.9
like but not just like oh it sounds cool

3520.92 --> 3525.119
but literally like I think that's part

3522.9 --> 3526.859
of the puzzle is that

3525.119 --> 3529.559
we are like

3526.859 --> 3531.839
I see is now we're talking believe I

3529.559 --> 3533.94
think that we are all our Consciousness

3531.839 --> 3536.5789999999997
are like spiritual fragments of the

3533.94 --> 3538.38
original designer which was never a

3536.579 --> 3541.38
physical being and he started out with

3538.38 --> 3543.0
the Elohim who literally shaped the

3541.38 --> 3546.48
Physical Realm

3543.0 --> 3550.2
into the proto-state that eventually

3546.48 --> 3552.66
yeah was keep re-engineered until it is

3550.2 --> 3554.339
what it is now right and I think that it

3552.66 --> 3556.799
started out with the designer that's

3554.339 --> 3558.839
outside of physical reality he entered

3556.799 --> 3560.7
physical reality or even manifested I'm

3558.839 --> 3562.44
not sure but in the Bible it's not

3560.7 --> 3564.0589999999997
described he entered it was already

3562.44 --> 3566.64
there there was something there was

3564.059 --> 3568.1400000000003
matter was here and then he rearranged

3566.64 --> 3570.66
it through the Elohim which was

3568.14 --> 3572.64
basically like the first gods

3570.66 --> 3576.839
and they

3572.64 --> 3578.819
yeah created humanity and life but

3576.839 --> 3581.22
Humanity back then I think Adam and Eve

3578.819 --> 3583.02
was not anything like what we're dealing

3581.22 --> 3585.18
with now because I think that they were

3583.02 --> 3589.559
colossal I think that they were actually

3585.18 --> 3592.44
gigantic like hundreds of feet tall

3589.559 --> 3594.599
incredibly large Giants and I think that

3592.44 --> 3597.78
all of humanity is basically descending

3594.599 --> 3599.52
from that so we're all sons of God if we

3597.78 --> 3601.8590000000004
started out as Giants and the more we

3599.52 --> 3604.2
became the smaller we became and the

3601.859 --> 3606.72
different conditions the conditions

3604.2 --> 3609.299
become more and more different on Earth

3606.72 --> 3610.859
because life is different and things

3609.299 --> 3614.22
have become smaller

3610.859 --> 3616.68
right bigger things transform more

3614.22 --> 3619.0789999999997
things like a really big tree has a

3616.68 --> 3621.0589999999997
bigger influence than a small tree so if

3619.079 --> 3623.2200000000003
every all life was gigantic back then

3621.059 --> 3625.3190000000004
there would have been an incredibly Rich

3623.22 --> 3628.16
atmosphere much more oxygen more

3625.319 --> 3631.079
pressure probably in general

3628.16 --> 3632.7599999999998
less gradiated because there were trees

3631.079 --> 3636.299
literally reaching up

3632.76 --> 3638.579
to who knows how high right or one

3636.299 --> 3642.18
gigantic tree even like I think that

3638.579 --> 3644.7000000000003
everything was one gigantic tree

3642.18 --> 3646.799
like the Earth itself like what we see

3644.7 --> 3649.859
on the map however that's a range I

3646.799 --> 3652.319
think that those are like all cut offs

3649.859 --> 3653.88
of root system I think that we're

3652.319 --> 3656.52
literally when we're looking at the map

3653.88 --> 3658.619
we're looking at the roots where the

3656.52 --> 3662.099
original Earth tree

3658.619 --> 3664.859
was in the earth and it was all cut off

3662.099 --> 3668.6600000000003
like a tree that's like thousands of

3664.859 --> 3668.66
miles potentially something like that

3668.7 --> 3672.7799999999997
hold that thought I just wanna I just

3670.799 --> 3674.819
wanna so that's belief right that is

3672.78 --> 3677.28
belief and that is my own that's like an

3674.819 --> 3679.44
origin story belief but it has nothing

3677.28 --> 3681.7200000000003
to do with like the realm mechanics

3679.44 --> 3683.819
outside of that because they are what

3681.72 --> 3686.64
they are the physics is what it is it's

3683.819 --> 3689.099
not a belief it's just palpably provably

3686.64 --> 3691.02
there I I agree on everything you just

3689.099 --> 3693.48
said right like there's like there's

3691.02 --> 3696.74
nothing I can you know discuss about

3693.48 --> 3699.96
that that's a certain view you have and

3696.74 --> 3702.0
that's fine that's that's yeah I don't

3699.96 --> 3705.299
there's nothing I could I could you know

3702.0 --> 3707.18
say to to go against that I just wanted

3705.299 --> 3710.22
you could you could try

3707.18 --> 3712.2599999999998
well you know it's no I I I'm just

3710.22 --> 3713.819
saying you could try I'm not I'm not

3712.26 --> 3715.92
disagreeing I'm not disagreeing but I'm

3713.819 --> 3717.96
not disagreeing also because it's it's

3715.92 --> 3720.54
not something I think about very much

3717.96 --> 3723.9
like this is a certain concept that's

3720.54 --> 3726.18
not very familiar to me right you can't

3723.9 --> 3729.2400000000002
really place it yet not yet no no no

3726.18 --> 3731.2799999999997
maybe uh maybe later just on a side note

3729.24 --> 3733.799
real quick I just want to explain to the

3731.28 --> 3735.48
people in chat like I'm not here to I'm

3733.799 --> 3737.579
not in this chat

3735.48 --> 3740.04
defend the globe or anything I'm not

3737.579 --> 3741.48
somebody who you know every day or not

3740.04 --> 3744.0589999999997
every day but who

3741.48 --> 3746.099
who is thinking about how can I prove

3744.059 --> 3748.44
this or that to people I'm just here to

3746.099 --> 3752.099
have a conversation I'm not going to try

3748.44 --> 3754.44
and and explain or show evidence or some

3752.099 --> 3757.2000000000003
[ __ ] like that I don't have I like I

3754.44 --> 3759.839
have proved The Grove right now yeah

3757.2 --> 3762.359
exactly empty dip [ __ ] I don't even know

3759.839 --> 3764.22
this if I had prepared it how how I

3762.359 --> 3766.5
would do it because I can only speak

3764.22 --> 3768.48
right I cannot you know show you any

3766.5 --> 3770.4
kind of you know or you could you could

3768.48 --> 3773.099
forward material to me that I can

3770.4 --> 3775.44
present on the show all right well yeah

3773.099 --> 3777.7200000000003
you could do that right yeah but you're

3775.44 --> 3779.88
you're just you're here to just have a

3777.72 --> 3782.64
conversation we might we might go a step

3779.88 --> 3784.559
further at other occasions here to have

3782.64 --> 3787.0789999999997
a conversation about all kinds of

3784.559 --> 3790.2200000000003
different topics and just to you know

3787.079 --> 3793.2000000000003
make it clear to any anyone who

3790.22 --> 3794.5789999999997
nobody's ever gonna convince me about

3793.2 --> 3796.14
what I think about the shape of the

3794.579 --> 3798.1800000000003
earth like you know you can just like

3796.14 --> 3800.64
I'm I'm trying to just be respectful to

3798.18 --> 3804.0
other people's thoughts and and what and

3800.64 --> 3805.799
and and Concepts right so and just for

3804.0 --> 3808.02
the rest I'm just asking you to you know

3805.799 --> 3809.94
have a conversation if you want to say

3808.02 --> 3812.7599999999998
something in chat or ask anything go

3809.94 --> 3817.14
ahead but I I'm not gonna

3812.76 --> 3819.96
provide you any evidence for my my my

3817.14 --> 3821.7
thought train or or belief system or

3819.96 --> 3823.68
whatever you want to call it right okay

3821.7 --> 3826.2799999999997
so let's continue

3823.68 --> 3826.2799999999997
all right

3826.38 --> 3831.299
um

3827.819 --> 3833.339
what we're talking about oh been all

3831.299 --> 3835.98
over the place yeah we've we have been

3833.339 --> 3838.02
origin story well I I gave you an

3835.98 --> 3840.66
alternative like you gave me a lot of

3838.02 --> 3843.599
your insights on like origin story

3840.66 --> 3846.72
and like what's going on out there and I

3843.599 --> 3850.02
gave you like the origin story of what I

3846.72 --> 3853.2
think the the real cosmology is and like

3850.02 --> 3855.0
the mystery of like our design that is

3853.2 --> 3858.4199999999996
incredible and beyond our understanding

3855.0 --> 3861.96
right but I've also the do certain

3858.42 --> 3863.16
patterns because of that model of seeing

3861.96 --> 3865.559
things like that

3863.16 --> 3868.799
and I really think it's true but there's

3865.559 --> 3871.6800000000003
like a physical entropy happening so the

3868.799 --> 3875.64
original proto-design of Adam was

3871.68 --> 3878.46
probably unbelievably amazing like they

3875.64 --> 3880.2
had power like literal Energy power

3878.46 --> 3883.7400000000002
probably they're not saying like Dragon

3880.2 --> 3886.74
Ball Z level necessary but in that sense

3883.74 --> 3889.319
they had so much energy they were so big

3886.74 --> 3892.5789999999997
and they had so much energy and so

3889.319 --> 3895.5
little sin existed

3892.579 --> 3897.42
because sin takes away energy that's

3895.5 --> 3899.28
what it always does and that's why

3897.42 --> 3900.96
people grab to sin because they're

3899.28 --> 3903.2400000000002
overloaded with energy they don't want

3900.96 --> 3905.579
to deal with it they sin it numbs down

3903.24 --> 3908.4599999999996
right well yeah

3905.579 --> 3910.559
agreed but that leads to becoming less

3908.46 --> 3913.079
capable of actually dealing with things

3910.559 --> 3915.3590000000004
and the energy and then you sin more and

3913.079 --> 3917.7000000000003
that's a down World spiral over and that

3915.359 --> 3919.799
and that goes over Generations right but

3917.7 --> 3922.2599999999998
the original Adam would have had so much

3919.799 --> 3924.66
energy and then when

3922.26 --> 3926.94
the entropy cycle started which was

3924.66 --> 3928.64
probably when he ate like from The

3926.94 --> 3930.48
Forbidden tree

3928.64 --> 3932.7
metaphorically I don't know if that's

3930.48 --> 3935.22
literally what happened but that's to

3932.7 --> 3937.0789999999997
make people common folk understand it

3935.22 --> 3939.9599999999996
sort of it might have been really

3937.079 --> 3941.46
complicated what actually happened and

3939.96 --> 3944.94
after that point

3941.46 --> 3947.04
like the younger children would the

3944.94 --> 3949.68
children which before that day weren't

3947.04 --> 3952.799
there like it was probably not even

3949.68 --> 3954.72
really procreation at all or time in

3952.799 --> 3956.7
that experience sense and then the

3954.72 --> 3959.16
entropy started

3956.7 --> 3962.339
and then everything becomes smaller

3959.16 --> 3964.68
energy becomes less but there is an

3962.339 --> 3966.24
evolution of the spirit though within a

3964.68 --> 3969.54
personal life cycle

3966.24 --> 3975.66
so what the heliocentrism in my view

3969.54 --> 3977.7599999999998
says about uh Evolution being the driver

3975.66 --> 3980.16
of life to develop it I think that

3977.76 --> 3983.099
that's exactly the other way around

3980.16 --> 3986.16
but at the same time the spirit is

3983.099 --> 3988.6800000000003
really denied a proper place

3986.16 --> 3990.48
in the mechanics of heliocentrism I mean

3988.68 --> 3991.859
they're sippy dippy [ __ ] that's allowed

3990.48 --> 3993.66
but they keep it completely

3991.859 --> 3995.4
compartmentalized they were so rigid

3993.66 --> 3997.68
about it in the science department right

3995.4 --> 4000.14
about spirituality but I think that

3997.68 --> 4002.7799999999997
there is an evolution of the spirit but

4000.14 --> 4004.7599999999998
an entropy of the physical and of the

4002.78 --> 4007.1600000000003
design the original design of God which

4004.76 --> 4009.2000000000003
was huge and we're getting smaller and

4007.16 --> 4012.68
we're getting more we're turning all

4009.2 --> 4015.6189999999997
into Grabbers basically physically we're

4012.68 --> 4018.2599999999998
getting more issues more burdens and

4015.619 --> 4022.539
yeah we and it's being made worse also

4018.26 --> 4022.539
right the degeneration is being even

4022.66 --> 4029.24
enhanced through the toxic environment

4025.9 --> 4032.1800000000003
psychologically toxic physically toxic

4029.24 --> 4035.839
and natural social behavior

4032.18 --> 4039.5
and all that compounds on the entropy of

4035.839 --> 4041.0
the of humanity and everything else

4039.5 --> 4042.859
right

4041.0 --> 4044.66
so they're trying to hasten that cycle

4042.859 --> 4046.5789999999997
of degeneration that's part of what the

4044.66 --> 4048.319
devil does

4046.579 --> 4050.48
yes dangerous thing though because if

4048.319 --> 4052.099
that escalates then nothing will be left

4050.48 --> 4055.46
eventually

4052.099 --> 4057.44
Yes except for those that have not

4055.46 --> 4059.2400000000002
participated that have isolated

4057.44 --> 4062.18
themselves completely

4059.24 --> 4064.52
and that managed to retain some of the

4062.18 --> 4066.7599999999998
old power through principle through

4064.52 --> 4069.2599999999998
doing things the right way

4066.76 --> 4070.76
regaining faculties although they will

4069.26 --> 4072.44
be isolated while the rest of the

4070.76 --> 4073.88
world's turning to Demons to them right

4072.44 --> 4075.7400000000002
because the more you ascend the more

4073.88 --> 4078.2000000000003
Consciousness you have the more you

4075.74 --> 4080.4799999999996
realize and see other people sin and

4078.2 --> 4083.48
what it does to them and how it traps

4080.48 --> 4087.26
you start to see all that naturally it's

4083.48 --> 4090.5
very painful and isolating in a way

4087.26 --> 4092.6600000000003
but yeah I mean people that like that

4090.5 --> 4094.76
are the ones that will survive it

4092.66 --> 4097.4
because everybody that just dives into

4094.76 --> 4099.259
sin and goes along with it gets lost in

4097.4 --> 4101.42
it and they will degenerate more and

4099.259 --> 4103.58
more and more until they basically all

4101.42 --> 4106.6990000000005
become sterile

4103.58 --> 4109.339
all that sort of thing right that is

4106.699 --> 4111.8589999999995
well you can literally see that process

4109.339 --> 4113.719
ongoing out there in the world it's like

4111.859 --> 4115.400000000001
oh this person looks really unhealthy

4113.719 --> 4117.679
why would that be

4115.4 --> 4120.5199999999995
uh you get to check them out and you

4117.679 --> 4124.16
notice that yeah they're mentally

4120.52 --> 4128.080000000001
dislocated or even deranged I'm mentally

4124.16 --> 4128.08
dislocated yeah but that's yeah

4129.38 --> 4133.58
it's like your spirit you

4131.66 --> 4136.58
functioning properly you're not yourself

4133.58 --> 4138.739
it's like click it's not broken because

4136.58 --> 4141.62
it can be unbroken but it's like flipped

4138.739 --> 4143.178999999999
it's like in yeah like you have a

4141.62 --> 4145.8189999999995
shoulder dislocation yeah it's not

4143.179 --> 4147.7390000000005
broken you could get it back but it's

4145.819 --> 4149.839000000001
like that it's you might not be able to

4147.739 --> 4152.299
you need somebody else to assist you and

4149.839 --> 4154.16
then it's really painful but then it's

4152.299 --> 4156.199
just back to normal and easily right

4154.16 --> 4158.259
that happens with the spirit too in

4156.199 --> 4161.0599999999995
response to

4158.259 --> 4163.219
unexpected spiritual trauma when you're

4161.06 --> 4165.620000000001
suddenly facing something that you're

4163.219 --> 4167.54
totally incapable of handling while you

4165.62 --> 4169.64
were really putting everything into it

4167.54 --> 4173.12
that can cause spiritual dislocation

4169.64 --> 4175.219
where you're just like you get numbed

4173.12 --> 4177.44
people would experience it as a sudden

4175.219 --> 4180.08
depression sometimes but it's like a

4177.44 --> 4183.139999999999
dislocation it's like oh isn't it you've

4180.08 --> 4184.64
been like spiritually snuffed out isn't

4183.14 --> 4186.7390000000005
a depression of basically what you're

4184.64 --> 4188.779
saying is spiritual dislocation

4186.739 --> 4191.54
I would say so

4188.779 --> 4193.219
I would say yeah but it doesn't yeah but

4191.54 --> 4194.9
that's not what people associate

4193.219 --> 4197.0
directly with depression though

4194.9 --> 4198.739
depression is with miserable feelings

4197.0 --> 4200.9
and not getting out of it

4198.739 --> 4202.699
I don't see a depression like that by

4200.9 --> 4204.5
the way because I have another model for

4202.699 --> 4207.44
it it's just kind of confusing I guess

4204.5 --> 4209.06
but I see depression as just being no

4207.44 --> 4211.16
more input you don't have any more

4209.06 --> 4213.7390000000005
impulses you're just a zombie like

4211.16 --> 4215.42
nothing means anything anymore to you

4213.739 --> 4218.178999999999
and you don't want to do anything that's

4215.42 --> 4221.78
real depression not the misery you can

4218.179 --> 4225.4
actually be comfortable with that right

4221.78 --> 4228.62
real misery comes from actually

4225.4 --> 4231.44
confronting and dealing with things but

4228.62 --> 4233.599999999999
it also leads to a price if you're not

4231.44 --> 4236.98
just giving everything away to demons

4233.6 --> 4239.96
and failing every time yeah that happens

4236.98 --> 4241.82
well yeah I guess I'm getting kind of

4239.96 --> 4243.7390000000005
esoteric right now yeah a little bit

4241.82 --> 4245.42
Yeah but I do believe like it's it's all

4243.739 --> 4248.0599999999995
within your own

4245.42 --> 4250.04
capabilities to change whatever you want

4248.06 --> 4252.02
to change right it all depends on how

4250.04 --> 4254.54
much you want something to change right

4252.02 --> 4257.360000000001
not in every case no no it's not how

4254.54 --> 4260.48
much you want it it's how much

4257.36 --> 4263.199
you're willing to see how what would

4260.48 --> 4266.36
happen when you do it you have to accept

4263.199 --> 4269.419999999999
doing it not just wanting it because

4266.36 --> 4272.0599999999995
people want the price they want that

4269.42 --> 4274.28
price of the better situation

4272.06 --> 4275.120000000001
they but they don't want to actually do

4274.28 --> 4276.8
it

4275.12 --> 4280.4
and that's the part you have to want to

4276.8 --> 4284.12
do it it like the thing that is going to

4280.4 --> 4286.159
be a maneuver away from the situation

4284.12 --> 4287.78
you're in yeah you have to walk and not

4286.159 --> 4289.639999999999
just the end result if you only want the

4287.78 --> 4292.42
end result you're never going to do it

4289.64 --> 4295.400000000001
obviously no and that's very common

4292.42 --> 4297.26
common issue for people oh that's true

4295.4 --> 4300.139999999999
that's true that's true

4297.26 --> 4303.56
so let's see what the

4300.14 --> 4307.219
yeah this is a great show by the way oh

4303.56 --> 4308.42
yeah I'm enjoying myself for sure yeah

4307.219 --> 4310.4
so

4308.42 --> 4313.28
great anyone have anything interesting

4310.4 --> 4315.46
to say inside chat see what is happening

4313.28 --> 4315.46
here

4316.57 --> 4319.67
[Music]

4320.9 --> 4325.759999999999
I resemble that sentiment I'm not

4324.32 --> 4328.88
impressed

4325.76 --> 4330.83
right check paper oh well that's always

4328.88 --> 4332.36
interesting thank you Godzilla

4330.83 --> 4335.42
[Music]

4332.36 --> 4337.46
oh right yeah you said uh I'm just

4335.42 --> 4338.3
thinking about something to get back to

4337.46 --> 4342.26
um

4338.3 --> 4345.14
I I don't know if I'm able to find it

4342.26 --> 4346.58
hold on yeah shout out to uh Godzilla

4345.14 --> 4348.8
thank you for the

4346.58 --> 4351.4
10 euros PayPal the nation much

4348.8 --> 4351.400000000001
appreciated

4351.62 --> 4356.12
thank you very much

4354.08 --> 4358.28
yeah just keep going

4356.12 --> 4360.44
uh yeah what's he what's he saying about

4358.28 --> 4361.94
concentric circles I don't know what the

4360.44 --> 4364.58
[ __ ] he's all about but

4361.94 --> 4367.879999999999
uh oh concentric circles is about yeah

4364.58 --> 4369.679
it's just that's geometric like it's how

4367.88 --> 4372.38
circles are in relation to each other

4369.679 --> 4373.76
right yeah yeah yeah I don't know what

4372.38 --> 4375.14
it has to do with what we're talking

4373.76 --> 4376.9400000000005
about though

4375.14 --> 4380.42
I don't know either he's just probably

4376.94 --> 4382.94
trying to argue why it's not a globe

4380.42 --> 4385.4800000000005
there's a lot of arguments for it

4382.94 --> 4385.48
true

4385.54 --> 4389.36
I mean I'm losing track of that [ __ ] I

4388.159 --> 4391.82
mean sometimes with the Flat Earth

4389.36 --> 4394.099999999999
debates Brian and all that is just going

4391.82 --> 4396.38
on with math and stuff and I'm like

4394.1 --> 4399.38
that's really impressive you figure that

4396.38 --> 4402.14
out but I just I can't remember that

4399.38 --> 4404.4800000000005
detail I mean this is

4402.14 --> 4406.52
I can roughly describe it

4404.48 --> 4408.379999999999
right but even like with the whole

4406.52 --> 4410.84
section situation

4408.38 --> 4414.02
that's really complicated set of

4410.84 --> 4416.2390000000005
argumentation but it's really solid but

4414.02 --> 4419.719
I can usually only remember the rough

4416.239 --> 4422.0599999999995
outlines of it in order to convey it to

4419.719 --> 4425.54
give people hints on what to look up

4422.06 --> 4427.580000000001
but I'm not like really a master in the

4425.54 --> 4431.239
details of the explanation like Nathan

4427.58 --> 4433.58
is right he's so good at just rolling it

4431.239 --> 4435.199
out like textbook Perfection well yeah

4433.58 --> 4437.12
I've

4435.199 --> 4438.259999999999
I've attend Nathan's show every now and

4437.12 --> 4441.199
then but

4438.26 --> 4442.88
um I I mostly hear him cussing out

4441.199 --> 4445.04
people like I don't know what his issue

4442.88 --> 4447.1990000000005
is but there you know usually when I

4445.04 --> 4449.6
tune in he's he's having a fight with

4447.199 --> 4452.96
somebody no he's not

4449.6 --> 4454.400000000001
maybe do it rarely these days oh I've

4452.96 --> 4456.44
been I've been tuning in the wrong times

4454.4 --> 4458.299999999999
then yeah well recently he's been

4456.44 --> 4460.879999999999
reviewing

4458.3 --> 4463.04
like weirdos on the internet basically

4460.88 --> 4464.719
anti-flat Earth there's and wizards ball

4463.04 --> 4467.14
Wizards like Neil deGrasse Tyson and

4464.719 --> 4470.0
other people and yeah then he gets a bit

4467.14 --> 4472.34
ranting like that he yeah he does that

4470.0 --> 4474.32
yeah you might not like it we have a lot

4472.34 --> 4478.1
of fun with that though because those

4474.32 --> 4480.44
people frustrate us enormously so

4478.1 --> 4482.42
I get that I get that yeah yeah I get

4480.44 --> 4484.28
that so you you were trying you're

4482.42 --> 4487.58
saying like you can I can I can I can

4484.28 --> 4490.219
offer you uh a certain uh piece of uh

4487.58 --> 4492.1
you know evidence I don't know if you

4490.219 --> 4494.84
would call evidence or like a video

4492.1 --> 4496.88
there's this thing that passed my my

4494.84 --> 4499.64
stream or what do you call it like my

4496.88 --> 4501.38
feed on YouTube uh it's a it's a guy

4499.64 --> 4503.84
recommended list he's like a

4501.38 --> 4505.88
photographer and then all of a sudden he

4503.84 --> 4507.9800000000005
turned he started making videos about

4505.88 --> 4510.86
Flat Earth like all of his [ __ ] is about

4507.98 --> 4512.299999999999
cameras and lenses and then you know you

4510.86 --> 4514.04
start to think about okay maybe there's

4512.3 --> 4516.320000000001
a lot of those people out there well

4514.04 --> 4518.96
yeah okay so maybe maybe you've seen

4516.32 --> 4520.34
this guy but I'll just send you uh well

4518.96 --> 4521.4800000000005
I'll just send the last one I don't know

4520.34 --> 4522.679
what the [ __ ] it is but it's the last

4521.48 --> 4526.459999999999
one he made

4522.679 --> 4528.32
it's about what is it equatorial mounts

4526.46 --> 4531.14
equatorial I don't even know what an

4528.32 --> 4534.799999999999
equatorial Mound is but it's probably it

4531.14 --> 4539.360000000001
probably has to do something with uh

4534.8 --> 4541.58
amount and the equator I guess

4539.36 --> 4543.739
I I don't yeah

4541.58 --> 4545.96
just well see I don't know I'm not

4543.739 --> 4548.299999999999
asking you to watch the whole thing on

4545.96 --> 4549.92
the stream no I'm not gonna I don't do

4548.3 --> 4551.84
that you can watch it in your own time

4549.92 --> 4554.179
and anybody else in a check and watch it

4551.84 --> 4557.54
in their own time and then oh you know

4554.179 --> 4562.1
Keegan yeah try to try to withhold your

4557.54 --> 4564.739
uh I don't react well to you know

4562.1 --> 4566.54
[ __ ] statements if you if you if you

4564.739 --> 4568.58
see something in that video and you find

4566.54 --> 4572.12
it interesting you want to refute what

4568.58 --> 4574.64
he's saying well I'd be happy to listen

4572.12 --> 4577.699
to that if it's constructed well I'll be

4574.64 --> 4580.34
happy to forward this video to the Flat

4577.699 --> 4583.04
Earth debate crowd sure so we can Grill

4580.34 --> 4584.96
the [ __ ] out of it yeah and then I could

4583.04 --> 4587.78
see what what you guys have to say

4584.96 --> 4590.12
because when I saw this video This is to

4587.78 --> 4593.3
you know to get your your

4590.12 --> 4595.58
um uh uh uh Vision about my perspective

4593.3 --> 4600.1990000000005
like just for you guys to you know Place

4595.58 --> 4602.84
yourself in my position as a glober

4600.199 --> 4605.419999999999
what he's saying to me is it all seems

4602.84 --> 4607.76
very logical yeah but it isn't it's all

4605.42 --> 4611.0
presuppositional he's going by the false

4607.76 --> 4614.96
dichotomy again of the disc versus the

4611.0 --> 4616.34
ball so he's inserted the first word you

4614.96 --> 4618.92
said I don't know what the what that

4616.34 --> 4620.78
means false dichotomy

4618.92 --> 4621.5
not before that

4620.78 --> 4623.42
um

4621.5 --> 4624.8
what do you mean well also false

4623.42 --> 4627.08
dichotomy I don't know what that means

4624.8 --> 4628.34
you don't know what that means I I don't

4627.08 --> 4631.82
know what if I I don't know what a

4628.34 --> 4634.64
dichotomy is it's two two choices that

4631.82 --> 4636.799999999999
are both wrong right so it is basically

4634.64 --> 4638.360000000001
straw Manning most Ballers are people

4636.8 --> 4640.219
that make videos about this sort of

4638.36 --> 4642.259999999999
stuff especially anti-flat Earth but

4640.219 --> 4645.44
even regular other people out there that

4642.26 --> 4648.08
address Flat Earth they straw man the

4645.44 --> 4651.08
[ __ ] out of the Flat Earth they always

4648.08 --> 4654.0199999999995
have their model representation of Flat

4651.08 --> 4657.5
Earth which has usually very little to

4654.02 --> 4659.4800000000005
do with what flat earthers are busying

4657.5 --> 4662.239
with except for a few that are really

4659.48 --> 4664.4
holding on to that archaic Assumption of

4662.239 --> 4667.239
it's very specifically a disc with the

4664.4 --> 4669.98
Dome and the Sun and the Moon are here

4667.239 --> 4675.0199999999995
and they okay those people that keep

4669.98 --> 4677.9
reifying details right so I assume that

4675.02 --> 4679.52
if you present this video to uh like a

4677.9 --> 4682.099999999999
group of people that believe in the Flat

4679.52 --> 4684.320000000001
Earth they'd be able to refute Point by

4682.1 --> 4686.0
point the points that he the points that

4684.32 --> 4688.58
he is bringing up in his video right

4686.0 --> 4690.56
easily I I don't even have to watch it I

4688.58 --> 4693.98
can see it from the slides that he's

4690.56 --> 4696.620000000001
presenting immediately yeah immediately

4693.98 --> 4698.959999999999
I know you're saying also that the model

4696.62 --> 4701.719
of the Flat Earth that he's presenting

4698.96 --> 4705.5
is not the one that you necessarily

4701.719 --> 4708.14
accept however it's probably excluding

4705.5 --> 4710.9
perspective and all those things and

4708.14 --> 4713.780000000001
going by the physicality assumption bias

4710.9 --> 4716.48
of the Sun and the Moon I'm seeing here

4713.78 --> 4718.639999999999
but yeah he's going by Celestial angles

4716.48 --> 4721.28
in this video yeah because I think

4718.64 --> 4723.38
that's nonsense as well that Celestial

4721.28 --> 4725.96
navigation wouldn't work on a flat Earth

4723.38 --> 4728.4800000000005
yeah that's absolutely harsh yet or or

4725.96 --> 4730.58
it was somebody else no I think that's

4728.48 --> 4733.28
the opposite it was him who said I don't

4730.58 --> 4734.78
I don't remember it only works on the

4733.28 --> 4737.36
Flat Earth because all the angle

4734.78 --> 4739.639999999999
measurements are taken on a flat Earth

4737.36 --> 4741.38
[ __ ] I should watch that video again

4739.64 --> 4743.900000000001
because I don't really remember what he

4741.38 --> 4745.76
said it's it's I'm like next time if I

4743.9 --> 4747.08
ever come on again I'm gonna prepare a

4745.76 --> 4749.54
couple of things because I feel like an

4747.08 --> 4751.219
ass right now not being able to explain

4749.54 --> 4752.96
the things that I have in my head

4751.219 --> 4754.82
because I haven't prepared anything okay

4752.96 --> 4756.679
I don't even know if it's necessary to

4754.82 --> 4758.78
prepare anything I just think it's funny

4756.679 --> 4761.179
to you know it's not that discussion

4758.78 --> 4763.219
about about you know all right it's it's

4761.179 --> 4766.52
but I can already tell you that this is

4763.219 --> 4768.7390000000005
not gonna last very long I can see it by

4766.52 --> 4770.360000000001
this dude you got to realize I've been

4768.739 --> 4772.159
doing this for like eight years now

4770.36 --> 4775.159
every freaking day

4772.159 --> 4776.9
I know when I see an argument I don't

4775.159 --> 4779.839999999999
even have to hear people I can just see

4776.9 --> 4781.639999999999
it by the slides you've went on it by

4779.84 --> 4784.12
yourself though you haven't had any oh

4781.64 --> 4786.92
no you did used to have guests on yeah

4784.12 --> 4788.719
my dad guests on the early bird show but

4786.92 --> 4791.179
at some point I just kind of like didn't

4788.719 --> 4794.54
want to anymore I was like no I'm just

4791.179 --> 4797.0
gonna I've been re changing how I do the

4794.54 --> 4799.34
early bird show many times over the

4797.0 --> 4801.8
years changing chat policy and

4799.34 --> 4804.62
eventually like if people came on that

4801.8 --> 4806.96
were just kind of weirdos and I was like

4804.62 --> 4809.0
I don't want that anymore so [ __ ] off I

4806.96 --> 4810.86
get that I don't want those weirdos like

4809.0 --> 4813.679
I don't want weirdo guests I want people

4810.86 --> 4815.719
that actually I can communicate with and

4813.679 --> 4817.4
that are interesting to talk to it's

4815.719 --> 4820.159
like yourself so

4817.4 --> 4823.04
mm-hmm yeah I know absolutely absolutely

4820.159 --> 4825.86
and like I I what I like I said I I like

4823.04 --> 4828.08
having uh watching a discussion or being

4825.86 --> 4830.0599999999995
part of a discussion between two people

4828.08 --> 4832.1
with opposing thoughts it's just an

4830.06 --> 4835.280000000001
interesting thing to see or to take part

4832.1 --> 4838.219
in right so uh

4835.28 --> 4840.38
uh talking about your your show and your

4838.219 --> 4842.0
chat right because obviously I tune in

4840.38 --> 4843.7390000000005
every now and then I don't always say

4842.0 --> 4845.42
anything especially when it's about Flat

4843.739 --> 4846.919999999999
Earth I usually keep my mouth shut but

4845.42 --> 4848.96
if it's about other things I'd like to

4846.92 --> 4852.92
converse alone with everybody

4848.96 --> 4855.32
but I do have noticed that and please

4852.92 --> 4857.78
don't don't take it as an install or

4855.32 --> 4862.099999999999
anything like that but yeah say it

4857.78 --> 4864.739
um I do sometimes feel like

4862.1 --> 4867.1990000000005
uh whenever somebody with an opposing

4864.739 --> 4869.239
thought comes on and they don't

4867.199 --> 4871.099999999999
necessarily Mo I have to be honest with

4869.239 --> 4872.718999999999
you I do agree most of the time the

4871.1 --> 4876.14
people that come on with opposing

4872.719 --> 4878.179
thoughts or uh baller baller people are

4876.14 --> 4880.280000000001
are complete idiots and they and they

4878.179 --> 4882.14
you know come in with an insult I don't

4880.28 --> 4884.0599999999995
see those people as Ballers they're

4882.14 --> 4885.679
trolls I don't even know what they

4884.06 --> 4887.54
believe they might not even believe in

4885.679 --> 4889.9400000000005
the glove they might simply be just

4887.54 --> 4892.1
there to Target Flat Earth exactly or

4889.94 --> 4893.599999999999
just Target you as well yes I know

4892.1 --> 4895.64
there's a couple of people that

4893.6 --> 4897.620000000001
specifically Target you but I can feel

4895.64 --> 4899.6
that like instantly that's why I'm so

4897.62 --> 4901.159
quick with the Banning it's like who's

4899.6 --> 4902.900000000001
that why are you Banning like yeah I

4901.159 --> 4906.08
could just see that it's that guy again

4902.9 --> 4909.62
but I've always of not always I've also

4906.08 --> 4912.38
seen people that come in and and try to

4909.62 --> 4915.08
you know uh get their side of their

4912.38 --> 4916.400000000001
Theory out and then they get you know

4915.08 --> 4917.78
hammered down pretty quickly and

4916.4 --> 4920.0
eventually they get banned and then

4917.78 --> 4921.259999999999
you're left with people that mainly just

4920.0 --> 4923.42
agree with you

4921.26 --> 4925.820000000001
thus you know kind of creating your own

4923.42 --> 4928.46
Echo chamber don't you feel like that is

4925.82 --> 4930.86
when when does that happen

4928.46 --> 4933.7390000000005
in general throughout throughout the

4930.86 --> 4937.159
last couple of years like oh okay yeah

4933.739 --> 4939.5
well not recently though not recently 80

4937.159 --> 4940.879999999999
or 90 of the people your band kind of

4939.5 --> 4943.28
deserve to get banned because they you

4940.88 --> 4945.32
know they said they say stupid [ __ ] but

4943.28 --> 4948.199
every now and then there's what was this

4945.32 --> 4952.34
guy's name like he was uh something with

4948.199 --> 4954.5
a like Professor Bell oh Phil bill yeah

4952.34 --> 4957.92
but he's a [ __ ] liar

4954.5 --> 4960.92
and he never he he made a technical

4957.92 --> 4964.52
mistake within heliocentric model which

4960.92 --> 4966.4400000000005
he professes and he wouldn't admit it

4964.52 --> 4969.38
and in that sense from a helio

4966.44 --> 4972.5599999999995
perspective heliocentric perspective I

4969.38 --> 4976.159000000001
deemed him unworthy as a teacher he is

4972.56 --> 4979.34
an unrepentant idiot who can't even get

4976.159 --> 4981.379999999999
his own belief straight and

4979.34 --> 4983.6
I don't want him around I don't want

4981.38 --> 4985.52
people that can never admit that they're

4983.6 --> 4988.159000000001
wrong when they're obviously provably

4985.52 --> 4990.92
wrong I I will not tolerate those people

4988.159 --> 4993.92
they could [ __ ] off basically basically

4990.92 --> 4996.62
I had him around for a long time but

4993.92 --> 4998.3
but like basically I'm also saying that

4996.62 --> 5000.46
you're wrong I'm just not saying it I'm

4998.3 --> 5002.08
just you know I'm like I said in a chat

5000.46 --> 5003.88
before I'm not I'm not being a dick

5002.08 --> 5006.64
about being uh what are you talking

5003.88 --> 5010.86
about well

5006.64 --> 5010.860000000001
[ __ ] I lost my train of thought here

5011.32 --> 5015.219
um

5013.179 --> 5017.26
Jesus Christ okay you brought up Phil

5015.219 --> 5020.38
Bill the way I deal with chat people and

5017.26 --> 5021.52
all that yeah yeah okay okay so

5020.38 --> 5023.64
um

5021.52 --> 5026.080000000001
[ __ ] what was it when I wanted to say

5023.64 --> 5029.26
please cut down on the f-bombs a little

5026.08 --> 5031.659
if you can come on and then

5029.26 --> 5034.360000000001
yeah well not well basically what I was

5031.659 --> 5036.099999999999
trying to say is that that every now and

5034.36 --> 5039.159
then I I do notice that when somebody

5036.1 --> 5040.4800000000005
comes in with uh you know trying to

5039.159 --> 5044.739
explain

5040.48 --> 5046.839999999999
certain things uh they do you know

5044.739 --> 5049.48
there's certainly a lot of people in the

5046.84 --> 5051.9400000000005
chat that ridicule straight away yeah

5049.48 --> 5054.339999999999
when a baller comes in like there's it's

5051.94 --> 5058.5
very hard to start a constructive

5054.34 --> 5061.360000000001
conversation in a chat on YouTube about

5058.5 --> 5062.62
serious topics because people are very

5061.36 --> 5066.5199999999995
quick to

5062.62 --> 5068.38
you know to cuss people out to ridiculed

5066.52 --> 5072.040000000001
people and without really you know

5068.38 --> 5074.5
having a constructive reply to anything

5072.04 --> 5076.78
they say right and that annoys me

5074.5 --> 5078.34
sometimes like uh yeah well there's

5076.78 --> 5080.44
nothing we could do about it it annoys

5078.34 --> 5082.42
me too I mean

5080.44 --> 5085.299999999999
if they're going too far I'll tell them

5082.42 --> 5087.04
right sometimes tear it 306 gets a

5085.3 --> 5090.46
little overheated and then I have to

5087.04 --> 5092.86
just say like hey dude stop that right

5090.46 --> 5094.78
but I mean it's not been really bad or

5092.86 --> 5098.58
anything I mean this is just standard

5094.78 --> 5101.8
goofing around well

5098.58 --> 5104.92
I'm on uh uh I don't know whatever your

5101.8 --> 5107.02
name is like uh now you understand is

5104.92 --> 5109.179
that true though is that true like back

5107.02 --> 5111.280000000001
and forth in chess why why even take

5109.179 --> 5114.1
part in in a chat of somebody else then

5111.28 --> 5116.5599999999995
of on a posting opposing thought if you

5114.1 --> 5119.5
know how is it possible that

5116.56 --> 5121.6
adult people cannot have regular normal

5119.5 --> 5123.219
conversation and it's not just this and

5121.6 --> 5125.02
I'm not talking about players because

5123.219 --> 5127.719
they're polarized through their beliefs

5125.02 --> 5130.360000000001
social media in general why yeah but let

5127.719 --> 5132.159
me answer it whatever people aren't just

5130.36 --> 5136.0599999999995
[ __ ] these it's just so stop the

5132.159 --> 5139.839999999999
f-bombs please oh sorry people are just

5136.06 --> 5142.6
uh very quick to you know degrade people

5139.84 --> 5144.52
it's annoying right it's because they

5142.6 --> 5145.84
have beliefs that cause them to be

5144.52 --> 5148.2390000000005
polarized

5145.84 --> 5149.679
it's the polarization that causes people

5148.239 --> 5152.08
to do that more and more and we're

5149.679 --> 5155.1990000000005
subjected by tons and tons of crazy

5152.08 --> 5157.12
beliefs more and more it's like oh oh

5155.199 --> 5159.219
you accepted this relief here's another

5157.12 --> 5160.9
one there's more you need to believe now

5159.219 --> 5163.0
and more great and they get it more

5160.9 --> 5165.699
crazy and absurd and you have to believe

5163.0 --> 5169.48
men get pregnant now and all that and

5165.699 --> 5171.58
yeah so know what so no of course not

5169.48 --> 5173.86
but that's lit there's literally people

5171.58 --> 5176.44
that will try to have you arrested if

5173.86 --> 5178.96
you publicly say they can't uh yeah this

5176.44 --> 5180.12
whole world yeah but yeah but that's

5178.96 --> 5183.639
another

5180.12 --> 5186.159
branch of the polarizing belief why does

5183.639 --> 5188.92
it exist just to create friction and

5186.159 --> 5190.12
argumentation you should watch you

5188.92 --> 5192.52
should watch Quantum of conscious

5190.12 --> 5194.44
sometimes about that because he talks

5192.52 --> 5197.679
about that very specific subject a lot

5194.44 --> 5200.138999999999
he's also in my favorite recommended

5197.679 --> 5202.06
list Quantum what's his name Quantum of

5200.139 --> 5205.179
conscious you can find him on my YouTube

5202.06 --> 5207.219
channel as one of my favorites okay

5205.179 --> 5209.02
I'll check him out I got Nathan Oakley

5207.219 --> 5210.9
Jim Bob and Quantum of conscious there

5209.02 --> 5213.52
for a good reason

5210.9 --> 5217.719
don't just put somebody in my favorite

5213.52 --> 5220.0
lists lightly right he talks about that

5217.719 --> 5222.28
it's it's creating conflict right so all

5220.0 --> 5225.159
this belief system is creating polarized

5222.28 --> 5226.9
conflict because you believe something

5225.159 --> 5229.36
or there's people that don't believe it

5226.9 --> 5230.98
you don't have to be against them and

5229.36 --> 5232.96
it's getting worse and worse and

5230.98 --> 5234.94
internal more conflict so it's just

5232.96 --> 5237.4
putting everything on tension and the

5234.94 --> 5239.98
more it gets like that the more people

5237.4 --> 5242.5599999999995
will just as a default

5239.98 --> 5244.718999999999
uh socially act like they're in the

5242.56 --> 5247.719
jungle because they are because there's

5244.719 --> 5248.9800000000005
wild poisonous things flying around and

5247.719 --> 5251.5
you if you don't

5248.98 --> 5254.379999999999
if you like let something just walk off

5251.5 --> 5256.239
yeah you you get killed or poisoned or

5254.38 --> 5258.04
something right right and that's but

5256.239 --> 5260.62
spiritually so it's metaphorically a

5258.04 --> 5262.48
jungle out there spiritually because of

5260.62 --> 5264.099999999999
all the psychological warfare all these

5262.48 --> 5266.379999999999
polarized beliefs that are being

5264.1 --> 5269.02
introduced and forced on people

5266.38 --> 5271.06
causing Division and so the attitude of

5269.02 --> 5273.159000000001
everybody is going to be more polarized

5271.06 --> 5275.320000000001
you've got to realize the situation in

5273.159 --> 5277.299999999999
the world right now I absolutely agree

5275.32 --> 5279.639
with with you on that like this whole

5277.3 --> 5282.6
this whole psychological warfare that

5279.639 --> 5284.86
that you know institutions are

5282.6 --> 5288.400000000001
professing at the moment

5284.86 --> 5290.259999999999
is uh unprecedented like uh that's why I

5288.4 --> 5292.9
don't I don't even have a TV anymore I

no sense but how can people far fall for

5379.239 --> 5383.62

5383.62 --> 5387.34
overwhelming amounts of it that's how

5386.26 --> 5389.1990000000005
people fall for it when you're

5387.34 --> 5391.659000000001
surrounded only by that

5389.199 --> 5394.239
then you're gonna pick something

5391.659 --> 5397.659
yeah I know true true

5394.239 --> 5399.459999999999
but yeah it's it's a it's a thing that

5397.659 --> 5401.138999999999
you didn't used to be like that and it's

5399.46 --> 5403.2390000000005
starting to get like that here as well

5401.139 --> 5406.6
like they sense you know sensationalize

5403.239 --> 5410.138999999999
certain news things and dude the Dutch

5406.6 --> 5412.179
news is so dying I mean it only runs

5410.139 --> 5414.400000000001
because it's being funded to keep

5412.179 --> 5417.1
running it is effectively State media

5414.4 --> 5418.78
there's no public interest barely it's

5417.1 --> 5420.219
just people that are really poor and

5418.78 --> 5423.159
don't know what the [ __ ] going on they

5420.219 --> 5426.159
might still hold on that's it nobody's

5423.159 --> 5427.54
watching this television crap nobody you

5426.159 --> 5430.0
don't need to watch it for movies

5427.54 --> 5432.34
anymore so what are you gonna watch it

5430.0 --> 5434.38
for like special entertainment that is

5432.34 --> 5437.02
all laced with disgusting propaganda

5434.38 --> 5439.84
yeah but you forget that there's a large

5437.02 --> 5443.5
part of people that still believe that

5439.84 --> 5445.78
the news is factual that they they can

5443.5 --> 5447.58
believe anything that what like that the

5445.78 --> 5449.62
news is the truth there's you know

5447.58 --> 5451.84
there's well not a lot of them I mean

5449.62 --> 5455.199
they're dying out literally because of

5451.84 --> 5456.82
that so that's gonna run out literally

5455.199 --> 5460.719
run out like those people will be

5456.82 --> 5464.62
depleted and dead eventually

5460.719 --> 5466.42
true I guarantee it if you don't wake up

5464.62 --> 5468.4
from this [ __ ] you're gonna be led to

5466.42 --> 5470.56
your death and that is a guarantee or

5468.4 --> 5472.659
winning guarantee

5470.56 --> 5474.639
and then aside from that you know it's

5472.659 --> 5476.679
not not just a television but I have I

5474.639 --> 5478.6
have a younger half sister right she's

5476.679 --> 5482.32
uh my dad got remarried and you know

5478.6 --> 5486.159000000001
popped out another kid she's 15. she's

5482.32 --> 5487.54
the way she uses her telephone or her uh

5486.159 --> 5489.04
her mobile phone

5487.54 --> 5491.62
it's just

5489.04 --> 5493.659
like I I can't I can't wrap my head

5491.62 --> 5495.219
around it and The Tick Tock thing she

5493.659 --> 5496.54
does like she's standing in the middle

5495.219 --> 5498.159
of the [ __ ] Street dude oh sorry

5496.54 --> 5500.679
she's kind of in the middle of the

5498.159 --> 5503.5
street doing this dance and like I'm but

5500.679 --> 5505.719
what what it's like lip syncing to it's

5503.5 --> 5507.82
like why what are you doing like you're

5505.719 --> 5510.1
you're creating nothing you adding

5507.82 --> 5511.78
you're not feeling anything to this one

5510.1 --> 5515.26
right it's fooling around using you're

5511.78 --> 5517.0
just being a little micro snob monkey do

5515.26 --> 5520.179
right you see something and it's like

5517.0 --> 5522.76
why like go be creative paint a painting

5520.179 --> 5524.32
make music or do something else but

5522.76 --> 5526.659000000001
people are

5524.32 --> 5528.58
I feel like what I'm trying to get at is

5526.659 --> 5532.42
that with all these social media things

5528.58 --> 5534.699
mainstream news it's like they're you

5532.42 --> 5537.42
know institutions are trying to dumb

5534.699 --> 5541.719
down the general population so they can

5537.42 --> 5544.179
make it easier to get them to vote a

5541.719 --> 5547.179
certain way and make it easy for example

5544.179 --> 5549.34
like presidential debates in the US

5547.179 --> 5551.4400000000005
they're not really debates it's just

5549.34 --> 5554.56
like one one line or after the other

5551.44 --> 5557.86
it's just like simple simple

5554.56 --> 5560.1990000000005
uh texts and things that people you know

5557.86 --> 5561.46
yeah it's getting towards idiocracy more

5560.199 --> 5564.638999999999
and more

5561.46 --> 5566.7390000000005
so yeah you know idiocracy the movie oh

5564.639 --> 5568.78
yeah I just like I I've never seen it I

5566.739 --> 5571.379999999999
just watched it I've never seen it I

5568.78 --> 5574.0599999999995
watched it last week I'm not even okay

5571.38 --> 5577.179
amazing can you imagine the year that

5574.06 --> 5578.38
that came out like how much is that six

5577.179 --> 5581.7390000000005
or something

5578.38 --> 5583.900000000001
it's like uh yeah 2006 but can you

5581.739 --> 5586.659
imagine the world wasn't like this back

5583.9 --> 5590.379999999999
then can you imagine like Oh What It

5586.659 --> 5593.5
showed you is is so Revel even the

5590.38 --> 5596.02
mannerisms like they really predicted

5593.5 --> 5597.82
the degeneration and that's what I think

5596.02 --> 5599.620000000001
whenever I see these Tick-Tock idiots

5597.82 --> 5601.239
I'm thinking like that's this this is

5599.62 --> 5603.46
the world we're heading to like this is

5601.239 --> 5605.62
the I'm watching the collapse of society

5603.46 --> 5608.08
in slow motion right part of it insane

5605.62 --> 5609.94
only part of it right I mean you always

5608.08 --> 5611.86
get to see the terrible [ __ ] this is a

5609.94 --> 5613.299999999999
universal rule throughout history no

5611.86 --> 5614.98
matter the media you always get to see

5613.3 --> 5617.02
the terrible [ __ ] news get to see the

5614.98 --> 5618.099999999999
terrible [ __ ] people are popularized

5617.02 --> 5620.860000000001
that are terrible they get in

5618.1 --> 5623.7390000000005
everybody's attention there's a lot of

5620.86 --> 5625.78
people out there also that really know

5623.739 --> 5629.759999999999
this and they really stay away from

5625.78 --> 5632.92
media that is poisonous and they're like

5629.76 --> 5636.0
isolating themselves to really restart

5632.92 --> 5638.86
and like find Grassroots again like the

5636.0 --> 5641.02
Grassroots type homesteading movement

5638.86 --> 5643.42
like what Benjamin is behind there's

5641.02 --> 5647.02
that's pretty big it's pretty big out

5643.42 --> 5650.4400000000005
there and all the technology has gone

5647.02 --> 5653.1990000000005
forward as well and it can be used for

5650.44 --> 5655.0599999999995
that without becoming dependent on it

5653.199 --> 5657.759999999999
right

5655.06 --> 5660.580000000001
you mean these self-sufficient uh places

5657.76 --> 5662.52
yeah New farmers that are just doing it

5660.58 --> 5664.9
for them not for some economic gain

5662.52 --> 5666.52
exactly right because those are the ones

5664.9 --> 5668.138999999999
that are not going to be corrupted by

5666.52 --> 5670.5
this those are the ones that are going

5668.139 --> 5673.179
to have still genetic purity

5670.5 --> 5674.92
and old knowledge

5673.179 --> 5678.6990000000005
you know while everybody else is

5674.92 --> 5680.7390000000005
completely idiotic like idiocracy they

5678.699 --> 5682.78
will remain they will remain there and

5680.739 --> 5685.599999999999
they will eventually when the the

5682.78 --> 5688.3
idiocracy collapses they will take over

5685.6 --> 5691.96
they will be those Meek that will

5688.3 --> 5694.4800000000005
inherit the earth literally see me what

5691.96 --> 5696.28
is Meek I agree like I'm not I'm going

5694.48 --> 5698.739
to tell you a funny story right now I'm

5696.28 --> 5700.9
not even joking this is this is true uh

5698.739 --> 5702.4
I bought a house like years ago I bought

5700.9 --> 5703.9
a house one of the best decisions I've

5702.4 --> 5705.759999999999
ever made because now I can sell it with

5703.9 --> 5707.138999999999
a profit I was talking to a friend of

5705.76 --> 5709.3
mine I was thinking like what am I going

5707.139 --> 5711.58
to do with this Prophet because I I you

5709.3 --> 5713.26
know I'm gonna invest in in something

5711.58 --> 5716.92
try to make more money out of it and

5713.26 --> 5719.139
then this guy told me this idea and he

5716.92 --> 5720.46
said like ah what I would do if I if I

5719.139 --> 5722.92
had that money because I'm gonna get

5720.46 --> 5726.639
like 200k out of the house right so the

5722.92 --> 5728.5
profit is going to be 200k 200k and you

5726.639 --> 5730.6
sound like why don't you go like just

5728.5 --> 5733.659
over the Border in Germany buy a piece

5730.6 --> 5735.58
of land put like a greenhouse on it a

5733.659 --> 5738.219
large greenhouse and in that Greenhouse

5735.58 --> 5739.78
create compartments and then a little

5738.219 --> 5741.639
compartment to live and then a

5739.78 --> 5743.44
compartment to farm because it's in a

5741.639 --> 5745.54
greenhouse it's going to be 20 degrees

5743.44 --> 5747.4
all the time you get moisture you can

5745.54 --> 5749.38
grow your own stuff you can you can be

5747.4 --> 5752.32
completely independent

5749.38 --> 5754.2390000000005
and like lately I've been annoying

5752.32 --> 5756.46
myself about [ __ ] that happens in the

5754.239 --> 5758.08
world like I don't have kids I don't

5756.46 --> 5759.94
have a girlfriend at the moment and I'm

5758.08 --> 5761.0199999999995
thinking like I'm getting annoyed by a

5759.94 --> 5762.5199999999995
lot of stuff that happened that's

5761.02 --> 5764.620000000001
happening in the world and I was

5762.52 --> 5767.56
thinking about buying a a van right

5764.62 --> 5771.099999999999
buying this self self-sufficient van

5767.56 --> 5773.5
just driving around okay until I [ __ ]

5771.1 --> 5775.659000000001
die I don't know and then but he

5773.5 --> 5777.46
suggested that thing that's not even a

5775.659 --> 5778.659
bad idea because you're putting money in

5777.46 --> 5780.699
ground grounds is going to be worth

5778.659 --> 5783.0599999999995
something anyway it can be totally

5780.699 --> 5785.98
independent from anything

5783.06 --> 5787.360000000001
uh you know I'm trying like I'm not I'm

5785.98 --> 5790.599999999999
not even thinking that's a bad idea

5787.36 --> 5793.839999999999
maybe just totally live off great right

5790.6 --> 5796.3
because what do you do if when we really

5793.84 --> 5799.96
think about it do yeah I know I've known

5796.3 --> 5803.38
I've been yeah dude I'm like 43 almost

5799.96 --> 5805.42
like I've seen people do that okay you

5803.38 --> 5807.76
have any idea what actually of great

5805.42 --> 5809.62
what that's like

5807.76 --> 5811.719
uh well yeah yeah I have because we're

5809.62 --> 5814.239
in the Netherlands okay so we're we're

5811.719 --> 5816.639
born super immersed in in how this all

5814.239 --> 5820.959999999999
works I know but I've tried I've lived

5816.639 --> 5825.159000000001
in Canada for for a year and uh uh in in

5820.96 --> 5827.32
Alberta and in BC and uh I've been off

5825.159 --> 5829.179
the beaten path uh more than once more

5827.32 --> 5831.099999999999
than you can do here right right yeah

5829.179 --> 5833.1990000000005
because you can't do that here you just

5831.1 --> 5835.3
can't no it's impossible there's no

5833.199 --> 5838.178999999999
Wilds like that you can go to like yeah

5835.3 --> 5840.1
there's no there's no actual old Force

5838.179 --> 5841.6
here anymore there's just one I think in

5840.1 --> 5843.76
the middle of the country towards the

5841.6 --> 5846.6990000000005
east but for the rest basically Holland

5843.76 --> 5849.6990000000005
is one big city you know yeah it's it's

5846.699 --> 5851.739
insane I remember explaining to my

5849.699 --> 5852.58
friend in Canada who's from uh from

5851.739 --> 5856.299999999999
Victoria

5852.58 --> 5858.1
and I I I I I think I just came back I

5856.3 --> 5860.679
was on the bike he called me I was on

5858.1 --> 5862.900000000001
the bike my my mother lives in one town

5860.679 --> 5864.88
and my dad lives in another town so I

5862.9 --> 5867.219
live in separate towns and I was biking

5864.88 --> 5869.86
I saw and I was cleaning to him like

5867.219 --> 5871.42
yeah I'm on the bike I'm biking to my I

5869.86 --> 5873.82
just left my mom's house and going to my

5871.42 --> 5875.38
dad's house we're conversing and by the

5873.82 --> 5876.5199999999995
time the conversation was done I was

5875.38 --> 5878.139
like yeah I'm gonna hang up because I

5876.52 --> 5880.4800000000005
arrived at my dad's house he's like

5878.139 --> 5882.76
wasn't in a town over him so yeah but

5880.48 --> 5883.599999999999
you know the next town is two miles up

5882.76 --> 5886.6
the road

5883.6 --> 5888.34
yes that's that's something yeah that's

5886.6 --> 5889.96
that's really understand because like

5888.34 --> 5891.76
how can that that's not it's not a

5889.96 --> 5893.9800000000005
different town it's the same town so

5891.76 --> 5895.84
basically it is yeah yeah for them

5893.98 --> 5899.5
that's just the the house down the road

5895.84 --> 5901.360000000001
to them yeah yeah and two miles up for

5899.5 --> 5903.219
us it's a different town people can have

5901.36 --> 5905.08
a different accent that they call that

5903.219 --> 5907.659
they literally would call Net two miles

5905.08 --> 5911.679
away next door it's like yeah that's an

5907.659 --> 5913.659
absorb that way so yeah no the distances

5911.679 --> 5916.3
the nature you have in countries like

5913.659 --> 5919.599999999999
Canada us or or whatever wherever you're

5916.3 --> 5921.639
going you know it's it's it's yeah it's

5919.6 --> 5924.52
not comparable to what we have here so

5921.639 --> 5927.82
yeah I do know how it is to to live

5924.52 --> 5929.8
off-grid I've actually I I was a a

5927.82 --> 5932.92
lumberjack when I was working in Canada

5929.8 --> 5935.02
I did that up north in Canada they call

5932.92 --> 5936.88
it tree falling basically it's like Pest

5935.02 --> 5940.540000000001
Management you cut down trees that are

5936.88 --> 5942.400000000001
infected with a uh with a with a bug and

5940.54 --> 5944.56
uh you cut them down not a caterpillar

5942.4 --> 5946.42
ones don't fire it and then you know

5944.56 --> 5947.8
they manage it they can't eradicate it

5946.42 --> 5950.02
but they manage it

5947.8 --> 5952.12
yes right I did that for for a while and

5950.02 --> 5953.5
yeah man that's fun it's fun I like that

5952.12 --> 5956.739
kind of life

5953.5 --> 5959.44
yeah that sounds interesting

5956.739 --> 5962.379999999999

the chat and it's like this this uh this

6029.4 --> 6033.9
care form where you can buy locally

6031.38 --> 6035.52
locally grown products it's like it's

6033.9 --> 6038.638999999999
not far from where you live

6035.52 --> 6040.620000000001

time exactly right not right now well in

6046.62 --> 6051.54
any case it's been uh it's been helpful

6048.84 --> 6053.400000000001
and uh yeah let's do it again yeah

6051.54 --> 6055.38
thanks for being on here with me it's

6053.4 --> 6056.719
been very entertaining show and like my

6055.38 --> 6059.46

6059.46 --> 6064.26
sure yeah yeah thanks to everybody in

6062.04 --> 6067.5

6064.26 --> 6069.4800000000005
know I hope uh they didn't find me

6067.5 --> 6071.46
boring or anything but uh I thought it

6069.48 --> 6074.04
was a nice change to Pace let's say

6071.46 --> 6075.78
yeah no I think you've been a great

6074.04 --> 6077.76
conversation that sometimes you get a

6075.78 --> 6080.82
little bit like long-threaded but it's

6077.76 --> 6083.360000000001
because like Focus issue you as you said

6080.82 --> 6085.799999999999
you don't really do this typically so

6083.36 --> 6087.659
that that happened to me all the time

6085.8 --> 6089.9400000000005
when I started out just listen to my

6087.659 --> 6091.98
flatter talks shows and you'll see that

6089.94 --> 6094.799999999999
I am kind of stumbly at times as well

6091.98 --> 6096.178999999999
right so that's okay but I think that uh

6094.8 --> 6097.7390000000005
yeah it's been you've been in great

6096.179 --> 6099.179
conversation list and I'd love to have

6097.739 --> 6100.799999999999
you on again and

6099.179 --> 6103.38

6109.44 --> 6113.159
fun if other people like I'm trying to

6111.36 --> 6115.679
you know plant that seed you know chat

6113.159 --> 6118.86
listen in other people maybe yeah maybe

6115.679 --> 6120.54
some of them okay so uh yeah I'm gonna I

6118.86 --> 6122.219
I need to fix the rest of my car because

6120.54 --> 6124.199
I used to be a car mechanic and I

6122.219 --> 6126.3

6124.199 --> 6127.919999999999

6132.719 --> 6138.199
conversation I'll see ya okay see you

6135.42 --> 6138.1990000000005
all right later

6142.8 --> 6148.639
Jewel called assistant okay Skype thanks

6145.219 --> 6148.639
right yeah

6151.92 --> 6154.6990000000005
that was great

6155.94 --> 6159.5599999999995
hope you guys all enjoyed that

6160.199 --> 6163.099999999999
I certainly did

6165.44 --> 6170.36
so statist is a pretty cool guy

6171.06 --> 6175.159000000001
so yeah maybe I'll have him on more

6172.8 --> 6175.159000000001
often

6178.92 --> 6185.119
what chords and what are you talking

6182.82 --> 6185.119
about

6186.659 --> 6191.04
yeah sorry I haven't really followed the

6188.76 --> 6194.9400000000005
chat I mean you've all been rolling out

6191.04 --> 6199.08
enormously but I haven't read anything

6194.94 --> 6201.48
I was just focusing on the stairs here

6199.08 --> 6204.5
he was reading the chat though I I

6201.48 --> 6204.5
haven't really done it

6204.659 --> 6209.78
except when somebody highlights it a

6206.76 --> 6209.780000000001
sentence with my name

6210.3 --> 6215.46
guests are a key to more viewers you

6212.82 --> 6217.5599999999995
think so did I have more viewers

6215.46 --> 6218.82
I mean yeah I had more chat activity for

6217.56 --> 6222.2390000000005
sure

6218.82 --> 6225.799999999999
but it says like 31 watching I mean

6222.239 --> 6225.799999999999
that's kind of the standard

6226.92 --> 6233.4800000000005
Flex some knowledge muscle today

6229.5 --> 6233.48
yeah no it was great

6233.699 --> 6238.44
and he

6235.8 --> 6240.06
like I could like he's a good guy to

6238.44 --> 6241.98
have a conversation with I talked to him

6240.06 --> 6245.900000000001
in Dutch too and he's

6241.98 --> 6245.9
like that that really worked

6247.44 --> 6251.099999999999
so yeah I had a lot of fun on this show

6249.84 --> 6253.32
today

6251.1 --> 6255.360000000001
I was really nervous about it by the way

6253.32 --> 6257.46
but because I never I don't I didn't

6255.36 --> 6259.739
know who he was I just had this picture

6257.46 --> 6262.26
of him and the picture is not super

6259.739 --> 6264.98
impressive to me but he looks actually

6262.26 --> 6264.9800000000005
pretty cool

6269.78 --> 6276.139
like uh yeah somebody that does take

6273.06 --> 6276.139
good care of themselves

6283.739 --> 6287.638999999999
hey Adam making you were listening to

6285.42 --> 6289.86
yeah it was great wasn't it interesting

6287.639 --> 6292.92
also because there was still a bit of

6289.86 --> 6295.08
Flat Earth versus ball and then

6292.92 --> 6297.3
I had the opportunity to basically

6295.08 --> 6299.58
explain it psychologically a lot of

6297.3 --> 6302.900000000001
detail

6299.58 --> 6302.9
so yeah that was great

6303.78 --> 6308.4
like I should probably watch this back

6305.76 --> 6311.76
just to see how how it went if there's

6308.4 --> 6313.5
anything that I could do better I

6311.76 --> 6316.26
probably shouldn't have said like uh-huh

6313.5 --> 6319.139
yeah as much

6316.26 --> 6320.9400000000005
it's just that

6319.139 --> 6324.4800000000005
when I'm in a face-to-face conversation

6320.94 --> 6328.339999999999
I always do that a lot it's like a proof

6324.48 --> 6328.339999999999
to me that I'm actually following it

6329.76 --> 6334.8
it's like me giving a sign like yeah I'm

6331.679 --> 6336.719
actually engaged it's me saying yeah huh

6334.8 --> 6339.0
that sort of thing

6336.719 --> 6342.0
but yeah it can be a bit disruptive when

6339.0 --> 6346.159
you're uh like in in the media situation

6342.0 --> 6346.159
so but I'll check out how that pans out

6347.76 --> 6353.719
right but I think I'm gonna round out

6349.56 --> 6353.719
the show somewhere get some lunch

6355.199 --> 6361.5
I didn't defend the globe much none not

6358.8 --> 6363.92
really but he tried to lay down his fuse

6361.5 --> 6363.92
on it

6364.32 --> 6369.659
and at least yeah he inquired I I really

6367.38 --> 6372.4800000000005
like the part about the the gas pressure

6369.659 --> 6375.54
gradient situation I mean that was a

6372.48 --> 6380.239
really fluid detailed

6375.54 --> 6380.239
conversation part that was really good

6382.32 --> 6388.44
because he he wasn't like getting biased

6385.8 --> 6390.659000000001
about it he was it was pretty neutral

6388.44 --> 6392.159
about just like how he thought about it

6390.659 --> 6394.138999999999
and

6392.159 --> 6396.96
and yeah

6394.139 --> 6401.2390000000005
and his questions and I was he let me

6396.96 --> 6401.2390000000005
completely explain it and that was great

6407.159 --> 6412.32
right so anyway yeah I hope you guys
