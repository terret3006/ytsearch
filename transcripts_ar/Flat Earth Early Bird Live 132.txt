5.77 --> 39.44
[Music]

35.739 --> 43.37
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

39.44 --> 46.489
early-bird number 132 I'm your host

43.37 --> 47.269
Arwen and sorry for being a little bit

46.489 --> 52.57899999999999
late guys

47.269 --> 58.399
I actually was up really early this

52.579 --> 60.14
morning did some stuff and then there

58.399 --> 65.72
wow I got a bit weary and thought like

60.14 --> 70.55
maybe just like take just a little nap

65.72 --> 73.509
well did it it was awesome but lasted

70.55 --> 79.67
for three hours instead of half an hour

73.509 --> 83.05
so yeah sorry it wasn't nice but yeah

79.67 --> 87.8
this morning was interesting it was

83.05 --> 93.259
really heavily foggy misty this morning

87.8 --> 98.45
and now it's super clear bright and

93.259 --> 104.77
sunny so it's it's an amazing beautiful

98.45 --> 109.299
day and I'm feeling kind of good as well

104.77 --> 113.439
of yesterday evening

109.299 --> 114.71900000000001
well apparently no I can't complain to

113.439 --> 117.78899999999999
Google anymore

114.719 --> 121.149
about holding back money because yeah I

117.789 --> 124.149
think I got a large chunk of my super

121.149 --> 130.14
chat money donated on my bank account

124.149 --> 134.459
kind of unexpected so yeah that happened

130.14 --> 138.92999999999998
and was quite significant because it was

134.459 --> 142.769
250 euro something like that even more

138.93 --> 146.95000000000002
which is pretty massive for am i doing

142.769 --> 148.72
completely offset my bank account and I

146.95 --> 151.17999999999998
also by the way ordered the new

148.72 --> 153.569
microphone which should be arriving any

151.18 --> 158.53
moment now

153.569 --> 164.53
today potentially could arrive actually

158.53 --> 168.4
during the show but yeah I'm in great

164.53 --> 171.64000000000001
spirits overall and I got that extra

168.4 --> 175.15
health sleep health from that with that

171.64 --> 178.07999999999998
well so having in just an extra cup of

175.15 --> 183.15
coffee wake me up

178.08 --> 187.86
any sleeping warrior real you was pretty

183.15 --> 191.3
interesting so yeah this is real you it

187.86 --> 191.3
was pretty interesting what you did

192.08 --> 200.61
yesterday evening I don't know exactly

197.28 --> 203.31
who was on there with you but it was

200.61 --> 207.57000000000002
really it was a baller that much was

203.31 --> 212.67000000000002
obvious but it I didn't even know for

207.57 --> 217.07999999999998
sure who it was but it was very it was a

212.67 --> 220.01999999999998
good debate to look at so thank you for

217.08 --> 223.14000000000001
that sleeping warrior do actually come

220.02 --> 226.29000000000002
on my panel every now and then maybe we

223.14 --> 229.60999999999999
can discuss gravity and your allergy of

226.29 --> 229.60999999999999
energies of it

235.8 --> 241.84
all right

238.06 --> 245.77
Einstein did show that gravity wasn't a

241.84 --> 250.0
force but it manifested itself as a

245.77 --> 252.87
force that's in other words installed

250.0 --> 252.87
science fiction

258.48 --> 265.52000000000004
no I'm not backsliding sleeping warrior

261.45 --> 265.52
you simply haven't lost the allergies

266.72 --> 272.76000000000005
because every time I bring it up you

270.45 --> 277.38
can't really listen you can only declare

272.76 --> 282.27
how you always disagree with so much of

277.38 --> 286.94
what I say it's one of the primary

282.27 --> 286.94
things you have to say concerning myself

292.01 --> 299.28
anyway Einstein look

294.42 --> 303.93
Einstein didn't prove anything and he

299.28 --> 306.35999999999996
knew he just created a model on the top

303.93 --> 309.54
of the basic force this equilibrium to

306.36 --> 312.36
try and presume a cause as to how mass

309.54 --> 316.68
attracted mass and was pure science

312.36 --> 319.77000000000004
fiction based purely conceptual beyond

316.68 --> 324.54
the reach of the physical possibility to

319.77 --> 329.03999999999996
vary because yeah if you want to prove

324.54 --> 334.40000000000003
anything Einstein in relating oh go

329.04 --> 338.13
ahead see how gravity does bend

334.4 --> 342.27
space-time by increasing the mass

338.13 --> 347.07
incredibly locally somewhere do it you

342.27 --> 350.58
know go vary that mass to prove that the

347.07 --> 353.4
bending of space-time actually manifests

350.58 --> 355.8
in the first place you know then we can

353.4 --> 360.21
talk about gravity supposedly being

355.8 --> 364.5
caused by that condensed time-space you

360.21 --> 368.19
know it's all conceptual science fiction

364.5 --> 372.66
theory on top of the concept of the

368.19 --> 375.81
force disequilibrium and yeah Newton

372.66 --> 377.66
claimed the theory and really iodine

375.81 --> 381.26
stein didn't either

377.66 --> 384.3
didn't really claim a theory either

381.26 --> 388.46999999999997
he pretty much recognized that force

384.3 --> 392.04
this equilibrium constant and then

388.47 --> 395.40000000000003
proceeded without proving it because she

392.04 --> 399.0
can't get very calls started to just

395.4 --> 401.92999999999995
speculate what caused it because the

399.0 --> 404.16
presumed unprovable costs basically and

401.93 --> 407.7
science fiction speculate and that's

404.16 --> 411.68
what einstein does so neither do

407.7 --> 414.69
newtonian nor the Einsteinian concepts

411.68 --> 417.62
would even qualify as a theory of

414.69 --> 417.62
gravity really

418.15 --> 421.84
to be fair

427.15 --> 429.9
so

432.74 --> 440.41
right and it is just a story yeah let's

436.28 --> 440.40999999999997
quickly look who's in chat

444.15 --> 446.71999999999997
they

451.73 --> 458.33000000000004
it's billed GE flatlines [ __ ] use

454.19 --> 460.96999999999997
goddess which Bella over mu cool sky fly

458.33 --> 466.03999999999996
bright sleep more of course Steve phone

460.97 --> 468.19000000000005
each white curious yeah good to see you

466.04 --> 468.19
all

469.38 --> 472.94
let's I'm in debt

475.68 --> 479.21
oh [ __ ] it is

482.479 --> 492.949
so yeah by the way I was kind of very

487.93 --> 495.74
annoyed and embarrassed by figuring out

492.949 --> 499.039
that the youth character who was

495.74 --> 502.159
spamming my chat turned out not really

499.039 --> 506.719
to be youth and we getting really pissed

502.159 --> 509.599
off at him even telling him to to off

506.719 --> 514.25
himself that's kind of really annoying

509.599 --> 516.649
and stupid in retrospect I got totally

514.25 --> 519.169
troll baited and I'm kind of really

516.649 --> 523.669
embarrassed about it I also got a hint

519.169 --> 526.1899999999999
as to who did it because yeah I talked

523.669 --> 529.279
to you in chat somewhere else I think

526.19 --> 531.23
was it Patricius wasn't it sleeping

529.279 --> 532.79
worse and he's just said like no I would

531.23 --> 537.32
i wasn't even over it

532.79 --> 540.199
so Karen B says it was Apollo doing that

537.32 --> 543.5500000000001
and yeah I definitely think he could do

540.199 --> 548.29
that he's a he's a total nasty [ __ ]

543.55 --> 554.149
really is he was kind of funny as a

548.29 --> 557.0
newcomer with his NASA enthusiasm olbes

554.149 --> 561.199
materials but he turns out to have quite

557.0 --> 561.649
a nasty side and was probably him that

561.199 --> 565.1899999999999
did it

561.649 --> 567.709
and if I ever recognized him meeting him

565.19 --> 569.69
on the street I probably talked to him

567.709 --> 571.67
about it and if he get all smarmy I

569.69 --> 575.269
probably kick his ass because he's a

571.67 --> 577.63
scrawny guy even compared to me so yeah

575.269 --> 577.63
Apollo

578.43 --> 583.87
maybe you should stay in your mom's

580.84 --> 587.7900000000001
basement permanently because if you go

583.87 --> 587.79
out there you might bump into me someday

597.34 --> 601.24
anyway I'm gonna try not to be probated

600.4 --> 603.13
like that again

601.24 --> 607.3
I wasn't it kind of shitty mood anyway

603.13 --> 608.14
yesterday today no great some microphone

607.3 --> 612.39
coming up

608.14 --> 615.3389999999999
I got a D&D session in the evening

612.39 --> 620.8
looking forward to that using my new

615.339 --> 624.72
laptop to assist me the oversight being

620.8 --> 624.7199999999999
a game master quite needed

627.79 --> 641.26
just write PJ right Oh PJ he knows he

637.3 --> 643.51
knows what gravity is he's confident

641.26 --> 650.41
enough to just declare that it is a

643.51 --> 652.84
force barriers and other materials there

650.41 --> 658.9599999999999
and it all makes sense because of

652.84 --> 661.71
Aristarchus and dodo that's right he

658.96 --> 661.71
even said it

665.05 --> 673.02
so glad you know all of that yet you can

667.75 --> 677.14
even provide a shred of evidence or

673.02 --> 681.24
somewhat of a story to actually follow

677.14 --> 681.24
up on your theories too bad

689.92 --> 695.6189999999999
I guess outright declaration of silly

693.339 --> 701.1890000000001
things without backup is just your

695.619 --> 704.139
things and it's no structure no

701.189 --> 709.8389999999999
comparisons no evidence of any sort just

704.139 --> 715.169
a roughly conjured up silly sounding PHA

709.839 --> 715.1690000000001
level story that's what you do all right

719.49 --> 725.61
I wonder why these ballers keep on

721.679 --> 727.97
popping up in my chat every time it's

725.61 --> 727.97
weird

732.67 --> 740.4599999999999
and what do I say I have a daily show

735.22 --> 745.72
PTA and they say a lot and I actually

740.46 --> 749.83
compare things back it up make cases for

745.72 --> 752.44
my argument and not resort to spinning

749.83 --> 755.62
around red herring everyone whining like

752.44 --> 759.25
a little [ __ ] and just continue to

755.62 --> 762.1
perpetuate the same fake story over and

759.25 --> 767.47
over again I actually work on my

762.1 --> 771.01
concepts refine them I know it must be

767.47 --> 774.7
very hard for you to realize that people

771.01 --> 777.34
can actually do that when you obviously

774.7 --> 783.5500000000001
spend all your time just sitting and

777.34 --> 785.2
doing absolutely nothing I seriously

783.55 --> 787.74
wonder what you do with all your time

785.2 --> 787.74
sometimes

794.559 --> 802.699
what have I replaced Thank You more

797.689 --> 804.319
space with that's hilarious why would we

802.699 --> 806.4799999999999
need to replace something that is

804.319 --> 808.8789999999999
completely fictional in the first place

806.48 --> 812.059
it's very simple it's just a limited

808.879 --> 813.74
confine it's a law of thermodynamics

812.059 --> 816.29
there has to be a container of some

813.74 --> 819.319
sorts so I think the realm is the

816.29 --> 821.889
container it's very simple limited

819.319 --> 821.889
confined

834.01 --> 839.24
PJ

835.79 --> 843.8499999999999
that's pure projection and Aristarchus

839.24 --> 843.85
doesn't say anything it's a name

864.049 --> 874.2289999999999
yeah Logan's Paul's video that sucked

869.819 --> 881.789
what's kind of good that see Patricia

874.229 --> 885.1690000000001
yesterday and it's a guy again who

881.789 --> 885.169
brought him into the conference

886.67 --> 896.2099999999999
Robbi that he totally apologized for

892.97 --> 900.64
being an idiot and letting him in while

896.21 --> 903.46
he was clearly a troll and it was good

900.64 --> 906.23
it was good enough I guess

903.46 --> 909.2
still yeah

906.23 --> 912.5600000000001
almost everyone saw it at the time as

909.2 --> 917.45
soon as they heard Logan Paul a VIP

912.56 --> 920.54
really I think there was maybe a quarter

917.45 --> 923.6600000000001
of people that were just really super

920.54 --> 926.15
positive we're saying like oh yeah sure

923.66 --> 928.0899999999999
anyone is welcome and the rest of

926.15 --> 932.0
three-quarters were like are you serious

928.09 --> 933.59
this is a stupid decision and everyone

932.0 --> 938.02
was saying it at the time

933.59 --> 941.21
so yeah Robbie yeah that was stupid and

938.02 --> 944.99
I'm glad you at least have the balls to

941.21 --> 947.08
realize that it was and just don't do it

944.99 --> 947.08
again

953.85 --> 960.8100000000001
yeah yeah it does it does show a little

958.38 --> 963.87
bit of desperation it's not too strange

960.81 --> 967.53
to have a little bit of desperation when

963.87 --> 971.7
you're being assaulted from all sides

967.53 --> 974.76
and trolls and media corporations are

971.7 --> 977.13
trying to trick you in to make yourself

974.76 --> 979.35
look like a lunatic yeah that kind of

977.13 --> 980.64
tends to make you a little bit desperate

979.35 --> 985.6800000000001
as an organizer

980.64 --> 988.11
I think that's strange that you can

985.68 --> 990.26
become a little bit desperate I don't

988.11 --> 994.44
think that's strange at all

990.26 --> 999.08
but yeah it's no excuse though because

994.44 --> 999.08
should have just size them up and let

1000.04 --> 1005.75
let the loyalists let the real

1002.78 --> 1007.61
flat-earthers be the main stage and he

1005.75 --> 1010.73
recognized this and that's what I like

1007.61 --> 1012.29
that how he reflected upon the situation

1010.73 --> 1016.22
when he thought he should do it was

1012.29 --> 1020.56
totally right now if he can only stick

1016.22 --> 1023.48
to what he said and actually do it and

1020.56 --> 1025.49
not be a politician about it and just

1023.48 --> 1026.99
say what he thinks should be done and

1025.49 --> 1029.42
that sounds perfect and then he doesn't

1026.99 --> 1030.98
do it so if he actually dust it that

1029.42 --> 1032.8700000000001
could be a good thing

1030.98 --> 1038.92
could be a good thing for him as with

1032.87 --> 1038.9199999999998
flatterers the event organizer so yeah

1039.74 --> 1049.84
yeah and Logan Paul is a complete idiot

1043.73 --> 1052.669
and kind of very vapid an act or a

1049.84 --> 1055.27
shameless guy and he has an image of

1052.669 --> 1058.5200000000002
being a rebel while he's a clear

1055.27 --> 1062.539
corporatist slave with an attitude so

1058.52 --> 1067.789
he's a total puppet screenwriters text

1062.539 --> 1070.9089999999999
writers he still probably in the general

1067.789 --> 1073.669
situation improvised improvises a lot of

1070.909 --> 1076.64
things but when it comes to more serious

1073.669 --> 1079.99
videos it's all freakin scripted all of

1076.64 --> 1083.72
it is it he's a total actor a

1079.99 --> 1086.6200000000001
professional actor for money with an

1083.72 --> 1091.039
attitude in an image that is

1086.62 --> 1094.9089999999999
commercially prosperous kind of fitting

1091.039 --> 1097.299
with what the corporatists wants for

1094.909 --> 1100.5800000000002
targeting groups and they're trying to

1097.299 --> 1102.529
nudge him into certain behaviors and

1100.58 --> 1106.399
censoring himself and he does it he does

1102.529 --> 1110.39
all of it so he's a total media slave in

1106.399 --> 1112.76
that sense and the absolute worst

1110.39 --> 1116.3300000000002
candidate when it comes to being exposed

1112.76 --> 1119.47
to flat earth like there's nothing it

1116.33 --> 1123.8899999999999
could be useful in regards to that

1119.47 --> 1129.79
just let him clown around make fun of

1123.89 --> 1135.73
dead people being a wiseass and

1129.79 --> 1135.73
yeah just yeah go away

1138.44 --> 1141.01
yeah

1155.87 --> 1162.77
Oh Simon then hey if you want to come on

1161.72 --> 1166.49
my show

1162.77 --> 1168.71
sometimes your you're welcome if you

1166.49 --> 1174.6200000000001
would like to defend some part of your

1168.71 --> 1180.4
globe theories against my scrutiny I'll

1174.62 --> 1183.32
give you a go man maybe not now let's be

1180.4 --> 1188.919
short but hey if you want to be part of

1183.32 --> 1188.9189999999999
my panel then you can do that sometime

1203.8 --> 1209.01
so think about it maybe tomorrow or the

1206.83 --> 1209.01
day after

1209.82 --> 1221.6499999999999
yeah well Simon then at least I welcome

1213.7 --> 1223.96
you it's mostly opportunism cuz you I'm

1221.65 --> 1225.97
not gonna be super friendly with you

1223.96 --> 1228.73
okay I'm gonna basically give you the

1225.97 --> 1232.06
same approach as I did with conspiracy

1228.73 --> 1235.51
Katz I'm gonna scrutinize you but in a

1232.06 --> 1237.49
fair way unless you start to misbehave

1235.51 --> 1241.48
and I get sick of it and I'll kick it

1237.49 --> 1244.66
but let's not assume that's gonna be the

1241.48 --> 1247.6200000000001
case before we even start but I will

1244.66 --> 1247.6200000000001
give you a fair chance

1252.6 --> 1258.299
so yeah maybe we could do that this

1255.179 --> 1263.22
Sunday or something at least when I'm on

1258.299 --> 1266.1589999999999
time so you just tell me we'll figure it

1263.22 --> 1269.22
out it could be amusing interesting to

1266.159 --> 1272.8200000000002
see what you have to bring to the table

1269.22 --> 1274.679
and how much attention you've paid to

1272.82 --> 1277.1689999999999
what has been happening in the Flat

1274.679 --> 1279.509
Earth movement which is a lot to keep

1277.169 --> 1282.45
track of especially the science

1279.509 --> 1286.769
developments and yeah which you guys

1282.45 --> 1289.309
have been doing on the sidelines some of

1286.769 --> 1289.309
the ballers

1292.43 --> 1298.52
now simondon were the definition of

1296.06 --> 1304.1
misbehaving when it comes to my shows is

1298.52 --> 1306.25
not letting me over talk you and I

1304.1 --> 1309.32
promise I'm not gonna do that constantly

1306.25 --> 1312.11
but when I have the impulse to do it on

1309.32 --> 1314.84
this show and you then start to meta

1312.11 --> 1318.11
complain about it there's nothing that

1314.84 --> 1319.8799999999999
pisses me off more so when I offer talk

1318.11 --> 1321.8
somebody in a moment can be a bit

1319.88 --> 1324.74
annoying but people off talk one another

1321.8 --> 1327.05
I know when I do it on my show you're

1324.74 --> 1328.97
gonna have to accept it I'll keep it

1327.05 --> 1332.06
short and not ramble on like a rumpus

1328.97 --> 1334.79
for five minutes when I do it and as

1332.06 --> 1339.6499999999999
long as you don't go complaining pants

1334.79 --> 1343.0
about it it'll be fine all right

1339.65 --> 1349.1000000000001
yeah and sure I'll explain my model my

1343.0 --> 1352.37
model model flat earth model it's a

1349.1 --> 1355.6999999999998
model tank either looping flatterers

1352.37 --> 1357.82
sure I'll talk about that no problem at

1355.7 --> 1357.82
all

1360.809 --> 1364.59
mmm-hmm if you want

1380.28 --> 1383.36
it's just terrible dude

1384.23 --> 1393.95
anyway yeah you said Simon then yeah the

1390.929 --> 1393.95
invitation is open

1413.7 --> 1425.52
right yeah there was a bit of a annoying

1420.18 --> 1428.54
issue I I hope it's been resolved I'll

1425.52 --> 1433.35
figure it out quickly because yesterday

1428.54 --> 1436.07
that was freaky I was on the panel with

1433.35 --> 1443.73
the Flat Earth debates in the back chat

1436.07 --> 1445.11
and the sound didn't come through people

1443.73 --> 1448.56
could hear me

1445.11 --> 1451.11
but while in the panel I could never

1448.56 --> 1454.08
hear Nathan I could hear other people

1451.11 --> 1458.34
talk to one another and sometimes they -

1454.08 --> 1461.9399999999998
they just they didn't Butte no sound

1458.34 --> 1465.81
came through at all eventually I dropped

1461.94 --> 1468.48
and Skyped Nathan then through Skype I

1465.81 --> 1471.33
could hear all of them but for some

1468.48 --> 1473.49
reason the Google hangout system just

1471.33 --> 1476.31
screwed around with the sound that was

1473.49 --> 1478.47
quite unnerving and really pissed me off

1476.31 --> 1482.55
gave me the feeling like yeah Google is

1478.47 --> 1485.07
is actively trying to destroy the panel

1482.55 --> 1488.46
system because it was completely useless

1485.07 --> 1492.21
to me in that sense I hope it is fixed I

1488.46 --> 1497.39
haven't exactly done anything specific

1492.21 --> 1497.39
to fix it so I hope that's gone

1498.44 --> 1504.0800000000002
yeah flatlander you could hear me but I

1501.47 --> 1506.05
couldn't hear the panel so you could

1504.08 --> 1508.76
sometimes hear me in the middle of

1506.05 --> 1511.58
somebody's talking probably like hello

1508.76 --> 1515.35
is anybody there because I couldn't hear

1511.58 --> 1519.05
anyone it was extremely frustrating

1515.35 --> 1521.8999999999999
until I eventually called in called in

1519.05 --> 1525.11
through Skype with Nathan and then that

1521.9 --> 1527.95
was resolved but yeah panel was

1525.11 --> 1531.62
completely useless I actually had to

1527.95 --> 1536.03
mute myself in the panel and unmute the

1531.62 --> 1541.3899999999999
regular YouTube stream just to hear what

1536.03 --> 1541.3899999999999
everybody was talking about it's crazy

1544.98 --> 1555.799
so I hope that's fixed because otherwise

1550.34 --> 1562.26
yeah it's gonna be tough to deal with

1555.799 --> 1565.97
please no it's gonna be very tough to be

1562.26 --> 1565.97
yeah build a proper hangout

1567.49 --> 1570.1490000000001
so

1570.36 --> 1577.4099999999999
uh yeah I'm gonna keep it short this

1574.71 --> 1585.06
hangout it's very short hangout I was

1577.41 --> 1590.27
late and I will try to get on the

1585.06 --> 1593.22
debates that probably did start like you

1590.27 --> 1594.15
know yeah pretty much room now what

1593.22 --> 1597.3
starts now

1594.15 --> 1602.24
and yeah it's gonna be because of that

1597.3 --> 1602.24
you less than an hour hang out but oh

1602.45 --> 1605.45
well

1613.669 --> 1616.3290000000002

1625.56 --> 1631.59
yeah peanuts clerk now for some reason

1627.93 --> 1634.43
at least Google was screwing around with

1631.59 --> 1637.11
the Hangout system and and my sounds I

1634.43 --> 1640.2
thought first by the way it was like

1637.11 --> 1643.56
because of an update and in Windows that

1640.2 --> 1645.93
I did but then I undid those of this

1643.56 --> 1650.04
completely restarted over three times

1645.93 --> 1653.96
and it still didn't work so I hope it's

1650.04 --> 1653.96
gonna work now

1655.89 --> 1658.89
do

1661.34 --> 1667.389
