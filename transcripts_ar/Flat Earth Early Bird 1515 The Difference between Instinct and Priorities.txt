[Music]

90.5 --> 96.32
because yeah

92.64 --> 96.32000000000001
I mean I had a pretty good week

96.78 --> 99.38
but

102.18 --> 110.06
I have to keep going you know anyway

105.479 --> 110.06
uh whether today is again

111.0 --> 116.0
Restless

113.28 --> 116.0
clouded

116.159 --> 122.47900000000001
I guess there's rain sometimes but I

118.439 --> 122.479
haven't seen any rain here so far

122.939 --> 126.65899999999999
thank you

124.439 --> 128.88
well yeah at night probably has rain

126.659 --> 132.25900000000001
here and there a bit

128.88 --> 132.259
but yeah it's

133.94 --> 139.04
just overall very restless type of

136.86 --> 139.04000000000002
weather

139.86 --> 146.54000000000002
don't think it's that cold but

143.459 --> 146.54
it does feel cold

147.0 --> 152.22
all right

148.319 --> 154.879
low LSG first in chat good to see you

152.22 --> 154.879
are you doing

161.58 --> 165.739
hello Thor KC welcome

168.0 --> 171.0
foreign

171.92 --> 178.26
it is Saturday the 18th of February 2023

179.0 --> 182.07
uh

180.66 --> 185.16
let's check the weather

182.07 --> 185.16
[Music]

186.98 --> 190.76
12 degrees Celsius

192.9 --> 199.87900000000002
right oh lots of pretty

196.22 --> 203.94
precipitation well I'm not seeing it but

199.879 --> 207.26
I mean it has been around anyway uh

203.94 --> 207.26
hello steamy Traveler

212.63 --> 215.84
[Music]

217.819 --> 222.07999999999998
uh right so yeah yesterday

223.44 --> 228.68
there's a lot going on

226.08 --> 228.68
but there

229.58 --> 234.08
Flat Earth debate was interesting

238.799 --> 242.4
I forgot what we're talking about

240.239 --> 244.739
because I didn't know

242.4 --> 249.799
but yeah did pretty much stuff until

244.739 --> 249.799
late at night QE went live again

254.78 --> 260.16
that was hilarious

258.0 --> 262.199
there's some really crazy stuff being

260.16 --> 266.90000000000003
said by that

262.199 --> 270.36
supposed almost a doctor guy and uh

266.9 --> 274.63899999999995
yeah and then I kind of rounded out the

270.36 --> 274.639
day watching fox day

275.84 --> 280.69899999999996
and I don't know I was feeling pretty

278.699 --> 284.639
good

280.699 --> 286.5
and this yeah through conversation it

284.639 --> 290.699
was like interacting

286.5 --> 294.36
and then like the whole gamma thing like

290.699 --> 296.82
the whole personality Spectrum

294.36 --> 298.139
came up again and I had some ideas about

296.82 --> 301.199
it and

298.139 --> 303.3
I don't know why but well

301.199 --> 305.82
in retrospect I do know why but at the

303.3 --> 308.16
time I had no idea

305.82 --> 310.199
but he got really agitated with me

308.16 --> 313.699
because I had it wrong with my initial

310.199 --> 313.699
interpretation according to him

314.28 --> 321.65999999999997
and so I was basically trying to explain

318.84 --> 324.29999999999995
my train of thinking a bit I did it all

321.66 --> 326.28000000000003
pretty succinctly very quickly

324.3 --> 328.86
but

326.28 --> 331.5
like he read it all wrong and he almost

328.86 --> 335.699
threatened to ban me well he threatened

331.5 --> 338.639
to ban me like okay

335.699 --> 342.18
and then he proceeded to talk about

338.639 --> 344.6
I don't know very negatively I felt

342.18 --> 348.38
and it was that kind of like

344.6 --> 348.38
what the hell did I do

349.86 --> 354.86
eventually I was like okay

355.139 --> 358.52
yeah I guess I was wrong

361.74 --> 365.78000000000003
but it was all about

365.82 --> 370.5
I had the idea that

368.28 --> 372.05999999999995
like a difference between Gammas and

370.5 --> 373.62
Deltas would be they're a set of

372.06 --> 374.759
priorities

373.62 --> 378.18
right

374.759 --> 380.52000000000004
but Vox says Nope and he's basically the

378.18 --> 382.56
author of the system so can't really

380.52 --> 384.71999999999997
argue with him but

382.56 --> 387.539
it's just baffled to misunderstand it

384.72 --> 389.759
that much that is all about instincts

387.539 --> 393.24
Rhymes but then

389.759 --> 394.5
I just I kept on rolling and in my mind

393.24 --> 399.02
and

394.5 --> 399.02
I think that I might just have like a

402.9 --> 408.29999999999995
I like use words differently

406.48 --> 411.41900000000004
[Music]

408.3 --> 413.46000000000004
it might be initially because of the

411.419 --> 417.18
language barrier

413.46 --> 420.56
and because the way I use my language I

417.18 --> 420.56
mean people understand it

420.66 --> 425.759
but

422.34 --> 428.28
it might be like

425.759 --> 430.259
for example when I say Instinct I do a

428.28 --> 431.63899999999995
lot of things by instinct

430.259 --> 434.759
well

431.639 --> 438.06
I guess that technically it's not really

434.759 --> 442.34000000000003
the technical Instinct as in

438.06 --> 442.34
the no ratio instinct

443.699 --> 448.319
right

445.02 --> 451.08
the no rational Instinct it's it is

448.319 --> 453.47900000000004
partly that it's just

451.08 --> 455.58
quick

453.479 --> 459.539
it's not something I have to actively

455.58 --> 462.3
Ponder upon and so when it goes fully

459.539 --> 465.479
automated I call that instinct it it's

462.3 --> 469.08
almost like related to

465.479 --> 472.56
the way the word instinct is used

469.08 --> 475.139
in the original Star Wars

472.56 --> 477.62
by Obi-Wan Kenobi like just use your

475.139 --> 477.62
instinct

478.139 --> 483.78000000000003
don't think but that's like about the

481.02 --> 487.039
activity of thinking

483.78 --> 491.099
pre taking away your sensories right

487.039 --> 493.919
but it's not like just just a root of

491.099 --> 496.62
it's not just pure reflex because reflex

493.919 --> 500.18
pure reflex would be classified as

496.62 --> 500.18
Instinct so I've been like

500.46 --> 505.69899999999996
you mean intuition

503.039 --> 505.699
right

506.879 --> 511.52000000000004
so I guess I kind of mix up those words

513.18 --> 520.26
and fox is like was distinctly convinced

518.219 --> 522.0600000000001
then I guess I'll go with him on that I

520.26 --> 523.86
mean he's red the literature like he

522.06 --> 526.3199999999999
knows the origin of the use of this

523.86 --> 528.2
these words and all that right

526.32 --> 531.86
I just seem to have like another

528.2 --> 531.86
interpretation approach

532.2 --> 537.3000000000001
that's more

533.64 --> 539.76
like less deeply researched and

537.3 --> 543.0799999999999
reflected upon literally like through

539.76 --> 543.08
literature like he has

543.72 --> 547.9200000000001
and when I think of priorities it's like

546.42 --> 551.7199999999999
no that's

547.92 --> 551.7199999999999
your internal priorities

553.38 --> 558.0
it's like

554.7 --> 559.86
what you seek after

558.0 --> 562.44
right but that doesn't have to be

559.86 --> 566.279
cognitive

562.44 --> 569.22
that is typically like it's not like the

566.279 --> 572.64
reflex Instinct but it is like just

569.22 --> 574.5
going after your impulses right

572.64 --> 577.8
and that's a difference like Gammas

574.5 --> 578.76
typically just go after their impulses a

577.8 --> 580.9799999999999
lot

578.76 --> 583.64
from what I have learned to understand

580.98 --> 583.64
about it

587.6 --> 594.24
so yeah it just seemed to be like this

590.58 --> 598.08
weird entanglement of just

594.24 --> 601.2
different approaches and of the use of

598.08 --> 603.779
the language and it just didn't fit and

601.2 --> 606.0
he basically thought I was trying to

603.779 --> 608.18
sabotage him or something I was not at

606.0 --> 608.18
all

612.12 --> 615.9590000000001
it's like

613.26 --> 618.8389999999999
he literally thought I was a gamma like

615.959 --> 621.899
like it's some of these annoying people

618.839 --> 623.82
in my chat that pop up to to try to

621.899 --> 626.04
prove everything I say wrong and it's

623.82 --> 627.72
like what what's going on and that's not

626.04 --> 630.54
what I'm trying to do

627.72 --> 632.82
but I I couldn't even

630.54 --> 634.74
like I wanted to basically type it out

632.82 --> 637.5
right I mean I got

634.74 --> 639.899
activated I thought it was misunderstood

637.5 --> 642.54
that's when I start typing and basically

639.899 --> 645.54
lay down explanation and apologies and

642.54 --> 648.48
all but he was like

645.54 --> 651.14
I don't know currently in a time where

648.48 --> 654.0600000000001
he refuses to

651.14 --> 657.36
indulge people being elaborate

654.06 --> 660.2399999999999
elaborately spoken or something

657.36 --> 663.66
is basically because they're the I don't

660.24 --> 667.5
know is since the show before that it's

663.66 --> 670.079
just a really weird I felt like so

667.5 --> 672.2
like it was just not welcome all of a

670.079 --> 672.1999999999999
sudden

672.36 --> 677.6
couldn't

673.98 --> 677.6
he didn't want to

677.76 --> 683.66
get into it or have that conversation

681.3 --> 683.66
about

684.54 --> 688.38
it

685.98 --> 690.72
even though yeah you did kind of Bring

688.38 --> 692.7
It Up himself and that's how I asked the

690.72 --> 695.779
question it's just

692.7 --> 695.779
it was rude

702.959 --> 708.8
right so maybe it's just like he was

708.959 --> 714.1199999999999
getting all semantical instead of

712.079 --> 716.399
getting the esoterics of what I was

714.12 --> 719.0600000000001
trying to say I guess

716.399 --> 722.7
I guess that maybe Vox just really

719.06 --> 724.88
doesn't typically like esoteric type of

722.7 --> 724.88
talking

726.959 --> 731.459
he's more because he's more into

729.06 --> 733.6199999999999
literature and it's not really

731.459 --> 737.16
compatible

733.62 --> 741.079
could that be it hello Thor Casey Again

737.16 --> 741.079
by the way what do you saying

741.54 --> 745.26
right

743.1 --> 747.5
Instinct and intuition mix up yeah it's

745.26 --> 747.5
common

756.779 --> 762.36
foreign

758.6 --> 765.72
I felt terrible after that

762.36 --> 768.3000000000001
I had a pretty good day and that really

765.72 --> 770.5790000000001
just I like

768.3 --> 773.54
why do I feel like I'm being put on the

770.579 --> 773.54
spot and like

775.38 --> 779.76
because the way he proceeded to talk

777.3 --> 781.9799999999999
after that not reading

779.76 --> 783.779
then it was basically agreeing with him

781.98 --> 785.519
out loud he was reading everything I

783.779 --> 786.54
said out loud and

785.519 --> 789.3
just

786.54 --> 791.279
I felt like he was trying to use me as

789.3 --> 794.16
an example of gamma Behavior or

791.279 --> 795.959
something like what the [ __ ] is this

794.16 --> 800.18
no I'm not gonna get triggered because

795.959 --> 800.18
it but it was just because of the shock

804.06 --> 810.3
like what's going on

807.0 --> 813.66
why am I being put on the spot

810.3 --> 817.1999999999999
I had no ill intentions whatsoever and

813.66 --> 823.639
definitely not any sabotage like I don't

817.2 --> 823.639
do that I never do that have I ever like

826.079 --> 832.62
tried to sabotage something

829.079 --> 835.26
what I do is I try to like

832.62 --> 837.899
get it all out in the open like clarify

835.26 --> 840.3
I want to really understand it

837.899 --> 842.279
and yeah that can be

840.3 --> 845.2199999999999
a bit annoying sometimes I mean it's

842.279 --> 847.74
it's kind of like humble H being overly

845.22 --> 850.6800000000001
focused continually on that one little

847.74 --> 853.2
thing and he wants because he it we keep

850.68 --> 855.2399999999999
doing it to the highest of degrees over

853.2 --> 857.1600000000001
and over again he keeps asking the same

855.24 --> 859.5
thing again that's annoying

857.16 --> 862.92
and so it gets annoying but

859.5 --> 865.92
I mean I love it when people in my chat

862.92 --> 867.779
get over here and ask really detailed

865.92 --> 869.88
questions

867.779 --> 873.019
and even if they get it wrong yeah that

869.88 --> 873.019
might annoy me a little

874.74 --> 878.72
you know but I'm not gonna be like

879.0 --> 884.76
you're trying to undermine me

882.24 --> 888.1800000000001
unless there's like

884.76 --> 890.12
a persistent signs that they are

888.18 --> 894.06
because they're not

890.12 --> 896.779
responding to what I'm saying and I was

894.06 --> 896.779
I mean

897.06 --> 904.3389999999999
at first I was trying to

900.019 --> 904.339
clarify further my idea

904.92 --> 909.24
but he took that like apparently you're

907.56 --> 910.7399999999999
not supposed to

909.24 --> 912.36
continue

910.74 --> 914.339
your idea

912.36 --> 915.779
once you've put it down and he's already

914.339 --> 918.5400000000001
said no

915.779 --> 920.899
apparently that's like a real No-No is

918.54 --> 920.899
it

921.12 --> 925.199
I mean I'm in a chat it's not like I'm

923.459 --> 927.8389999999999
if we were in a face-to-face

925.199 --> 930.12
conversation then it's different then

927.839 --> 932.2790000000001
it's like actively ignoring some what

930.12 --> 934.579
somebody's saying I get it but it's a

932.279 --> 934.579
chat

938.519 --> 941.94
I just

939.7 --> 944.22
[Music]

941.94 --> 947.48
I'm kind of perplexed about the whole

944.22 --> 947.48
scenario that happened

965.3 --> 971.24
right so I thought like okay I can just

968.279 --> 975.06
try to ignore it or

971.24 --> 978.1800000000001
just have my day be ruined or try to

975.06 --> 981.18
just ah put it out on the open and be

978.18 --> 984.62
honest about everything and

981.18 --> 984.62
that's what I'm doing right now

986.88 --> 990.66
because yeah I

988.92 --> 993.66
if people

990.66 --> 997.62
that I respect suddenly start

993.66 --> 999.3
talking about Gammas like it's about me

997.62 --> 1002.48
or something

999.3 --> 1004.8199999999999
like if first like you're wrong and then

1002.48 --> 1006.5
Grill me and then start talking about

1004.82 --> 1010.779
Gammas I mean

1006.5 --> 1010.779
that's a really shitty experience

1011.24 --> 1015.86
if they then after that point basically

1013.279 --> 1020.0
don't address you as your

1015.86 --> 1023.259
literally saying I I stood corrected

1020.0 --> 1023.259
I agree with you

1025.819 --> 1029.6
I mean if somebody's gonna say that in

1028.04 --> 1032.4189999999999
my chat after I have a bit of an

1029.6 --> 1035.059
argument with them with the chat

1032.419 --> 1038.66
I will definitely

1035.059 --> 1040.459
give recognition to like oh they they

1038.66 --> 1044.1200000000001
yield or however you're going to see

1040.459 --> 1046.64
that right they're responding and he

1044.12 --> 1050.4189999999999
didn't do that at all

1046.64 --> 1052.94
and I'm like what what is this

1050.419 --> 1056.14
is this me or is this him

1052.94 --> 1056.14
what's going on here

1060.679 --> 1068.24
because as far as I know

1063.74 --> 1071.419
he knows that I am like

1068.24 --> 1073.88
not a just a random dumb person so I

1071.419 --> 1075.6200000000001
don't understand why he

1073.88 --> 1078.8200000000002
just

1075.62 --> 1078.82
treated me like that

1091.9 --> 1096.76
all right six minutes later

1099.38 --> 1106.72
I don't know do any of you know fox day

1103.58 --> 1106.72
some D live

1107.36 --> 1112.6399999999999
I mean he's the guy that's also running

1110.78 --> 1115.94
like the website

1112.64 --> 1117.8600000000001
for Owen Benjamin and all that

1115.94 --> 1120.4
and a lot more he's a very busy guy

1117.86 --> 1120.3999999999999
overall

1125.78 --> 1131.78
hello hello hello everybody in chat just

1129.32 --> 1134.78
all [ __ ] off seven minutes of silence

1131.78 --> 1134.78
really

1143.179 --> 1147.2800000000002
hello tiger bear let's see you

1148.15 --> 1151.219
[Music]

1152.179 --> 1155.0590000000002
it's like a bear do you ever watch Fox

1153.919 --> 1157.88
day

1155.059 --> 1161.3799999999999
anybody here

1157.88 --> 1161.38
do you even know who that is

1163.82 --> 1168.1
besides what I just said about him

1177.5 --> 1179.5
um

1191.179 --> 1197.74
is intelligent yeah

1194.36 --> 1197.74
and he's very well read

1214.28 --> 1219.039
so I guess that that yeah

1222.38 --> 1225.8600000000001
what okay

1231.86 --> 1236.7199999999998
right so there's nobody that's gonna

1234.38 --> 1240.2
give me any kind of like

1236.72 --> 1242.24
come on Arwen you know this and that and

1240.2 --> 1246.76
that that's how we do it like nobody

1242.24 --> 1246.76
here no nothing okay great

1247.88 --> 1250.48
uh

1253.22 --> 1257.119
[Music]

1269.059 --> 1271.299
foreign

1272.76 --> 1275.789
[Music]

1277.58 --> 1282.26
oh well let's just move on I'll probably

1280.46 --> 1285.6200000000001
change the title

1282.26 --> 1288.559
I mean it's just I thought that could be

1285.62 --> 1292.2399999999998
a subject but I mean people in the chat

1288.559 --> 1292.24
barely even know about him then

1292.58 --> 1296.799
yes no no point really is there

1306.159 --> 1311.98
done

1308.44 --> 1311.98
genealogy in the Bible

1312.44 --> 1317.5
wasn't possible

1314.9 --> 1317.5
what

1325.82 --> 1329.02
I don't get it

1330.08 --> 1336.08
so he's saying like that

1333.46 --> 1339.6200000000001
genealogy is basically doesn't add up

1336.08 --> 1342.02
that's what he said okay could be

1339.62 --> 1344.539
that's been a while ago since he talked

1342.02 --> 1347.179
about that I do remember

1344.539 --> 1348.98
appeared when he went would be

1347.179 --> 1352.9
discussing those types of things anyway

1348.98 --> 1352.9
hello flatter Sage good to see you

1364.84 --> 1371.0
right yeah anyway

1368.539 --> 1375.46
I keep track because he does do like a

1371.0 --> 1375.46
lot of interesting things sometimes like

1377.919 --> 1384.22
he's also just involved in a lot of like

1381.02 --> 1384.22
production of

1385.039 --> 1391.1
comic books

1387.799 --> 1392.84
and even like songs like rewritings of

1391.1 --> 1395.0
songs

1392.84 --> 1399.82
and some of them are really interesting

1395.0 --> 1399.82
I so it's like yeah I don't know I just

1400.88 --> 1406.419
that that kind of stuff draws me in

1403.94 --> 1406.419
sometimes

1406.58 --> 1411.559
because he does have also a lot of like

1408.74 --> 1414.64
he does talk in detail just about how it

1411.559 --> 1414.6399999999999
all works and

1415.34 --> 1420.5
how to manage a

1417.74 --> 1423.08
a production and all that and how to

1420.5 --> 1426.14
handle the artists it's it's all very

1423.08 --> 1428.6399999999999
informative I mean

1426.14 --> 1431.8390000000002
that's very useful information

1428.64 --> 1431.8390000000002
[Music]

1445.66 --> 1448.749
[Music]

1458.78 --> 1461.78
anyway

1470.78 --> 1474.34
if I finished my book no

1474.62 --> 1480.3999999999999
no I haven't yeah I should probably pick

1477.679 --> 1480.4
up on it again

1482.539 --> 1485.08
just

1488.539 --> 1493.7
I mean I'm not a really great reader for

1491.6 --> 1496.28
me it's very tough to concentrate on

1493.7 --> 1497.9
reading a lot of the time

1496.28 --> 1500.24
I have to find like these special

1497.9 --> 1502.46
moments when it's just

1500.24 --> 1505.82
when it suddenly works really well and

1502.46 --> 1509.1200000000001
that's not it's not that often

1505.82 --> 1511.3999999999999
I'm a terrible reader I just

1509.12 --> 1513.02
and that used to be an issue too when I

1511.4 --> 1515.1200000000001
was younger

1513.02 --> 1517.52
and it's like updates just say oh that's

1515.12 --> 1519.799
ADHD or something

1517.52 --> 1522.9189999999999
it's just I just have trouble focusing

1519.799 --> 1525.02
on reading I get very distracted very

1522.919 --> 1527.419
easily and then I don't actually end up

1525.02 --> 1529.24
reading and I just read something in my

1527.419 --> 1533.3600000000001
mind instead

1529.24 --> 1535.52
that happens most of the time

1533.36 --> 1538.039
especially when it's like Restless

1535.52 --> 1540.34
weather by the way that then it's the

1538.039 --> 1540.34
worst

1544.7 --> 1548.96
usually when it's like sunny and not

1547.58 --> 1551.6589999999999
windy

1548.96 --> 1553.9
type of weather that's when I read the

1551.659 --> 1553.9
best

1573.679 --> 1578.48
but I mean yeah and another way to

1576.86 --> 1581.12
actually get through

1578.48 --> 1584.179
with books for me

1581.12 --> 1587.299
is to like basically

1584.179 --> 1590.98
put everything else aside and just

1587.299 --> 1590.98
like get through the books

1591.799 --> 1597.1399999999999
but that would mean like basically turn

1594.98 --> 1602.919
off my computer

1597.14 --> 1602.919
four days and that would mean I no show

1605.6 --> 1611.059
because then I can really just only

1608.539 --> 1615.279
rearrange my mind in a way to purely

1611.059 --> 1615.279
absorb the reading material

1616.52 --> 1622.6399999999999
the best

1619.159 --> 1625.1000000000001
times where I would be reading would be

1622.64 --> 1628.22
during summer vacation

1625.1 --> 1632.36
like at the beach with a book

1628.22 --> 1635.299
and literally there's nothing to do

1632.36 --> 1637.58
just reading

1635.299 --> 1640.539
or go in the water to cool off or have

1637.58 --> 1640.539
lunch and that's it

1640.7 --> 1643.72
lots of light

1645.78 --> 1651.9189999999999
[Music]

1648.799 --> 1655.94
that worked great that's how I read the

1651.919 --> 1655.94
entire Lord of the Rings saga

1668.72 --> 1674.1200000000001
so yeah sorry to disappoint steamy

1670.88 --> 1678.0390000000002
traveler I'm I'm not that good or well

1674.12 --> 1678.039
not that quick with reading in general

1684.26 --> 1688.8799999999999
but I don't know maybe I could take the

1686.299 --> 1691.7
day off tomorrow or something and just

1688.88 --> 1695.679
get to reading

1691.7 --> 1695.679
if you guys would be okay with that

1714.98 --> 1720.7
I read most of the Bible

1717.86 --> 1720.6999999999998
uh

1724.76 --> 1729.86
well

1727.159 --> 1731.72
I didn't like really Reddit all that

1729.86 --> 1734.9189999999999
linear

1731.72 --> 1734.919
I I read like

1735.2 --> 1739.88
I just

1737.24 --> 1742.4
looking for

1739.88 --> 1744.6200000000001
yeah spots sometimes I just open the

1742.4 --> 1745.8200000000002
Bible at a random spot and just read

1744.62 --> 1748.6399999999999
what's there

1745.82 --> 1752.539
I don't know I've not really read it all

1748.64 --> 1752.539
chronologically recently

1779.539 --> 1784.279
right any other books you want to ask me

1782.299 --> 1786.1399999999999
about whether I've read through it or

1784.279 --> 1787.82
not and I can tell you again yeah

1786.14 --> 1790.1000000000001
probably not

1787.82 --> 1792.02
any other books

1790.1 --> 1794.4399999999998
want me to talk about that I haven't

1792.02 --> 1794.44
read

1835.399 --> 1837.399
um

1838.55 --> 1841.68
[Music]

1850.64 --> 1854.8600000000001
talking about the movie tiger bear

1856.279 --> 1859.779
I don't know if I've ever seen that one

1861.02 --> 1866.3799999999999
right oh by the way there was some uh

1863.6 --> 1866.3799999999999
somebody yesterday

1866.48 --> 1870.039
gave me this video link

1870.38 --> 1876.159
concerning

1872.659 --> 1879.919
some old video from the 90s in which

1876.159 --> 1882.74
non-space was mentioned

1879.919 --> 1885.38
I did actually watch that and that was

1882.74 --> 1888.32
absolute garbage

1885.38 --> 1890.659
I mean that was like it was like the

1888.32 --> 1893.299
other guy said they watched it and said

1890.659 --> 1895.8200000000002
it was this sounds like flatter Society

1893.299 --> 1899.72
I totally agree

1895.82 --> 1902.059
it was absolute junk talking about oh

1899.72 --> 1905.059
they're moving from space into

1902.059 --> 1907.039
non-spaces like what the [ __ ] is this

1905.059 --> 1909.1399999999999
this [ __ ]

1907.039 --> 1911.6
it's a little horseshit I mean that

1909.14 --> 1917.0800000000002
conception doesn't even deserve to carry

1911.6 --> 1917.08
the name non-space it's absolute tribe

1919.52 --> 1924.679
so yeah I had to make mention of that

1923.14 --> 1925.44
[Music]

1924.679 --> 1928.8590000000002
God

1925.44 --> 1928.8590000000002
[Music]

1938.02 --> 1943.12
funny appearance in okay

1944.2 --> 1951.32
Oh you mean he he made some video of me

1947.779 --> 1954.75
or something another funny video

1951.32 --> 1957.4399999999998
okay whatever man

1954.75 --> 1961.659
[Music]

1957.44 --> 1961.659
that was the book tiger there okay

1963.2 --> 1966.4

1968.88 --> 1972.38
[Music]

1978.06 --> 1980.6
[Music]

1979.279 --> 1982.52
all right

1980.6 --> 1985.6999999999998
okay well I'm glad you enjoyed it

1982.52 --> 1987.98
because I've never even heard of it

1985.7 --> 1992.02
the book

1987.98 --> 1992.02
I've never been a book reader

1994.039 --> 1999.3799999999999
I mean there's millions and millions of

1996.98 --> 2001.98
books out there that I've never ever

1999.38 --> 2001.98
heard of

2023.32 --> 2026.32
foreign

2027.419 --> 2031.38
don't worry about it tiger bear

2033.76 --> 2036.96
it's good to have here

2038.02 --> 2041.15
[Music]

2078.23 --> 2084.04
[Music]

2080.679 --> 2088.44
right so yeah I don't have a particular

2084.04 --> 2088.44
motivation to talk about anything really

2089.02 --> 2095.5
I said what I felt I needed to say

2092.679 --> 2098.98
about the situation yesterday

2095.5 --> 2102.04
and I could talk about anything it's

2098.98 --> 2104.94
just that I don't particularly feel like

2102.04 --> 2104.94
talking about anything

2105.7 --> 2110.339
so I might just as well just sit here

2107.8 --> 2110.3390000000004
silently

2120.94 --> 2126.06
hey Kumar virus

2123.4 --> 2126.06
it's been a while

2127.599 --> 2130.7400000000002
never up this early

2136.16 --> 2139.23
[Music]

2160.0 --> 2163.619
have I been uh

2167.079 --> 2172.3590000000004
well that's been very mixed

2170.32 --> 2174.46
when when was the last time you were

2172.359 --> 2176.5
hanging around here

2174.46 --> 2179.16
because in December I was not doing

2176.5 --> 2179.16
great at all

2182.14 --> 2187.6189999999997
I mean last week things were pretty cool

2192.7 --> 2196.5989999999997
I think I had some pretty good shows so

2194.619 --> 2199.1800000000003
far it's really today is one of the

2196.599 --> 2202.02
first days of like me just sitting there

2199.18 --> 2202.02
silently again

2203.079 --> 2208.44
been very fluid

2204.88 --> 2208.44
I think haven't I

2211.359 --> 2216.48
I don't know maybe today is just one of

2213.52 --> 2216.48
those freaking days

2218.2 --> 2222.8199999999997
or it's just the kind of energy depleted

2220.9 --> 2226.02
or something

2222.82 --> 2226.02
I don't know what it is

2230.859 --> 2233.2799999999997
all right

2242.74 --> 2245.339
foreign

2298.06 --> 2302.52
well that's a very nice thing to say LSG

2313.96 --> 2319.0
well I mean I guess that pretty much no

2317.02 --> 2322.119
matter what in just straightforward

2319.0 --> 2325.44
honesty there's always a cohesion

2322.119 --> 2325.44
and that's the honesty

2332.8 --> 2339.0600000000004
but yeah I am just having issues with

2336.22 --> 2339.06
feelings I think

2344.619 --> 2350.32
it's like

2347.2 --> 2353.56
things Hit Me Harder and they just drag

2350.32 --> 2355.3590000000004
on and like I can have all that tactical

2353.56 --> 2358.96
insight

2355.359 --> 2362.0789999999997
and like little tricks and like oh how

2358.96 --> 2364.48
to rearrange your focus but it just

2362.079 --> 2366.94
nothing will grip

2364.48 --> 2368.619
it's like it all just keeps sliding back

2366.94 --> 2371.02
down it's like

2368.619 --> 2373.06
my entire functioning

2371.02 --> 2375.64
suddenly tells me like no you're

2373.06 --> 2378.82
supposed to be [ __ ] humiliated

2375.64 --> 2383.02
you just should be really feeling really

2378.82 --> 2386.5
really really [ __ ] bad and

2383.02 --> 2389.7599999999998
because I just can't

2386.5 --> 2389.76
get away from it

2389.98 --> 2394.599
when something happens like I'm still

2392.74 --> 2396.3999999999996
sitting on it and I feel like

2394.599 --> 2399.94
embarrassed

2396.4 --> 2403.7200000000003
that I'm still sitting on it

2399.94 --> 2405.64
when intellectually I know better it's

2403.72 --> 2407.8799999999997
just I I don't know what to do to stop

2405.64 --> 2407.8799999999997
it

2409.06 --> 2416.64
I I want to let it go

2411.42 --> 2416.64
I've I should have resolved it

2418.18 --> 2422.16
unless there's just an

2425.44 --> 2430.2400000000002
and unless there was spiritual metadata

2428.26 --> 2432.76
that just slipped through

2430.24 --> 2434.8799999999997
like I got an occult Communication in a

2432.76 --> 2434.88
way

2434.98 --> 2437.46
right

2439.24 --> 2447.2999999999997
but yeah it's completely pointless

2443.98 --> 2447.3
it's all very negative

2448.54 --> 2453.46
I don't know it just it makes me

2450.76 --> 2455.32
paranoid

2453.46 --> 2457.7400000000002
when these things happens and I'm in

2455.32 --> 2457.7400000000002
this condition

2458.74 --> 2463.6099999999997
I start seeing too much in things it's

2462.099 --> 2464.98
very annoying

2463.61 --> 2468.54
[Music]

2464.98 --> 2468.54
still taking ashwagandha

2496.42 --> 2501.76
okay that's an interesting thing to say

2498.22 --> 2504.72
LSG let no man measure you with a ruler

2501.76 --> 2504.7200000000003
of his own creation

2505.599 --> 2508.2000000000003
huh

2508.72 --> 2511.68
okay

2514.119 --> 2517.6600000000003
right

2515.32 --> 2520.5
but what I just felt and I'm trying to

2517.66 --> 2520.5
figure out whether

2520.54 --> 2525.119
like how Fox operates

2525.4 --> 2530.94
on an intuitive level not Instinct

2528.28 --> 2530.94
intuitive

2532.72 --> 2539.4399999999996
like

2535.24 --> 2542.859
whether he actually could read where I

2539.44 --> 2544.7200000000003
was and whether he cared because it

2542.859 --> 2546.8199999999997
could be that he just didn't give a [ __ ]

2544.72 --> 2549.7
because he didn't feel like it and he's

2546.82 --> 2551.02
like no you get out of the way I don't

2549.7 --> 2555.48
want your

2551.02 --> 2555.48
up and close like inquiry

2555.76 --> 2560.19
and he didn't want to be overtly honest

2558.04 --> 2563.36
about it they could be that

2560.19 --> 2563.36
[Music]

2575.92 --> 2578.52
right

2580.9 --> 2587.14
I think I should just like

2584.44 --> 2590.2000000000003
be more careful to pick up spiritual

2587.14 --> 2592.5
metadata before I engage with certain

2590.2 --> 2592.5
people

2592.96 --> 2596.4
and in a way because

2597.16 --> 2602.5
like fox has spiritual metadata impulse

2601.3 --> 2605.6800000000003
but

2602.5 --> 2607.54
he is like not physically expressive

2605.68 --> 2609.819
about it at all

2607.54 --> 2613.66
and that makes it sometimes a bit alien

2609.819 --> 2616.02
for me to even try to read like what he

2613.66 --> 2616.02
wants

2622.96 --> 2628.78
and then he forces everything to go

2625.24 --> 2632.7599999999998
through his his ratio

2628.78 --> 2632.76
and then approach things that way

2634.24 --> 2636.7799999999997
anyway

2641.98 --> 2646.18
it's hard to show my own every day find

2644.619 --> 2648.579
things to talk about how long I've been

2646.18 --> 2650.819
doing this well count the count to show

2648.579 --> 2650.819
numbers

2655.48 --> 2658.02
right

2662.079 --> 2666.1800000000003
four years is it now

2666.22 --> 2669.06
let's see

2675.22 --> 2680.04
let's see yeah a little over 44 years

2680.079 --> 2682.7400000000002
foreign

2682.96 --> 2687.119
didn't I restart the count no

2690.52 --> 2693.599
what are you talking about

2695.56 --> 2700.66
the shows that I did before that were

2697.66 --> 2702.54
not the show that were flatter talks

2700.66 --> 2705.7599999999998
and they were not daily

2702.54 --> 2705.7599999999998
[Music]

2714.69 --> 2721.469
[Music]

2728.319 --> 2732.52
remember show number one like it was

2730.72 --> 2734.56
yesterday

2732.52 --> 2735.7
you win the fighters early bird number

2734.56 --> 2737.859
one

2735.7 --> 2740.02
huh

2737.859 --> 2742.319
that's kind of funny I don't remember it

2740.02 --> 2742.319
at all

2745.48 --> 2749.98
all I remember is kind of like from the

2748.0 --> 2753.099
early day from the early times of the

2749.98 --> 2756.3
show that I was really just nervous

2753.099 --> 2756.3
about the whole thing and

2760.359 --> 2763.92
that's what I mostly remember

2765.46 --> 2770.98
but also that I just really wanted to do

2767.98 --> 2773.5
it I had it it's also about it was about

2770.98 --> 2776.7
having something to prove towards myself

2773.5 --> 2776.7
in a way

2782.22 --> 2786.18
and in a way it still is

2792.76 --> 2799.119
right but yeah with just doing it every

2795.16 --> 2802.5
day comes You're Gonna Catch the moods

2799.119 --> 2806.52
and sometimes I'm like just not

2802.5 --> 2806.52
very engaging I think

2809.319 --> 2814.48
and other times I'm like really inspired

2811.78 --> 2818.5
and yeah well you know

2814.48 --> 2820.78
what happens I mean get really into just

2818.5 --> 2825.119
talking about dreams and they basically

2820.78 --> 2825.119
go dream walking right in front of you

2831.7 --> 2835.839
why is live chat count

2834.579 --> 2839.579
I

2835.839 --> 2839.5789999999997
I have no idea

2847.78 --> 2851.7000000000003
I think like maybe 20 people

2862.5 --> 2865.59
[Music]

2865.619 --> 2871.9
I mean if some of the Night Owl shows

2869.079 --> 2874.7400000000002
had like incredible amount of chat

2871.9 --> 2874.7400000000002
participants

2879.16 --> 2884.92
are you gonna do interviews

2882.94 --> 2887.5
Maybe

2884.92 --> 2889.7200000000003
I mean I'm still open for it I'm

2887.5 --> 2892.8
technically at the point like hey you

2889.72 --> 2892.7999999999997
wanna come on with me

2893.2 --> 2899.2
I mean I don't literally

2896.319 --> 2901.66
say it as a standard oh you want to join

2899.2 --> 2904.7999999999997
I don't say it like in my intro riddle

2901.66 --> 2904.7999999999997
right but it it's

2906.46 --> 2909.54
it's an option

2910.18 --> 2915.8999999999996
at this point

2912.22 --> 2915.8999999999996
sure I'd like to have people on

2919.18 --> 2921.5989999999997
right

2942.099 --> 2948.78
I don't know maybe in ways

2945.579 --> 2948.78
I should do that

2954.339 --> 2961.0789999999997
but I don't know like who who would you

2956.68 --> 2961.0789999999997
have me interview class called me a path

2962.02 --> 2967.78
might have to look into them

2965.38 --> 2971.579
and then yeah I could do that I mean at

2967.78 --> 2971.579
this point I'm like okay fine

2974.38 --> 2979.3
I'll talk to other people I I could just

2977.079 --> 2983.2000000000003
like basically

2979.3 --> 2986.26
get the focus of my life I mean maybe a

2983.2 --> 2988.54
lot of people by now are just really

2986.26 --> 2991.42
[ __ ] sick

2988.54 --> 2993.819
of just a guy that just talks about

2991.42 --> 2996.96
himself all the time

2993.819 --> 2998.98
when I'm obviously not like societally

2996.96 --> 3000.119
accomplished or anything if you know

2998.98 --> 3002.76
what I mean

3000.119 --> 3004.1400000000003
you know and maybe that is the freaking

3002.76 --> 3006.599
problem

3004.14 --> 3007.5
maybe that is the universal problem is

3006.599 --> 3010.44
that

3007.5 --> 3012.9
it can have all the explanation ability

3010.44 --> 3014.2200000000003
and all that whatever I want it's just

3012.9 --> 3017.1800000000003
that

3014.22 --> 3017.18
I don't have

3017.64 --> 3024.42
a wife gets a job

3021.0 --> 3026.16
that actually pays more than just barely

3024.42 --> 3029.2200000000003
getting by

3026.16 --> 3031.7599999999998
and that's just because of that like

3029.22 --> 3036.0
nobody is like

3031.76 --> 3038.6400000000003
socially like unspokenly allowed to

3036.0 --> 3041.46
associate with me because I'm just this

3038.64 --> 3044.64
embarrassment and all those factors just

3041.46 --> 3049.44
make it impossible for them to dare to

3044.64 --> 3052.44
even like recognize I exist is that it

3049.44 --> 3052.44
foreign

3064.14 --> 3068.66
people don't maybe just don't want to

3066.18 --> 3068.66
associate

3071.4 --> 3075.619
all right LSG I'll check the PayPal

3083.04 --> 3088.38
oh

3084.78 --> 3091.7000000000003
wow okay thank you that's that's great

3088.38 --> 3091.7000000000003
thank you at least

3091.98 --> 3094.94
it's very helpful

3105.059 --> 3108.44
on Benjamin

3108.839 --> 3113.16
what you really think Owen Benjamin is

3112.079 --> 3116.7000000000003
gonna have

3113.16 --> 3120.92
like a a thing with me

3116.7 --> 3120.9199999999996
really except happy

3124.559 --> 3127.2200000000003
dude

3135.619 --> 3140.54
I'd love to hear you out on why

3141.66 --> 3146.94
don't know if you guys talked before

3143.819 --> 3150.38
dude you know how freaking busy Owen

3146.94 --> 3150.38
Benjamin is in the first instance

3152.819 --> 3157.5
yeah that would be it would be awesome I

3155.04 --> 3160.2799999999997
agree I love it I just don't see that

3157.5 --> 3160.28
happening though

3160.74 --> 3163.7599999999998
like at all

3165.18 --> 3172.5589999999997
I think at best he he just rant about me

3169.98 --> 3173.94
how much of a [ __ ] gamma I am or

3172.559 --> 3177.3590000000004
whatever

3173.94 --> 3180.9
and like I'm not going anywhere

3177.359 --> 3182.94
right that I I don't know man maybe I

3180.9 --> 3186.079
just feel really [ __ ] terrible right

3182.94 --> 3186.079
now I don't know what it is

3189.48 --> 3196.079
ask him

3192.42 --> 3199.099
right you mean send an email

3196.079 --> 3199.099
or a letter

3200.339 --> 3204.14
that's going to cost though then

3218.579 --> 3225.2000000000003
how about Jimbo

3221.72 --> 3225.2
I don't know man

3232.38 --> 3237.78
I mean yeah sure I can go to Jim Bob and

3235.68 --> 3240.5989999999997
they show and all that I mean he's not

3237.78 --> 3243.3590000000004
gonna come on my show during my time

3240.599 --> 3248.339
slot are you out of your mind okay

3243.359 --> 3250.0789999999997
that's never ever gonna happen trust me

3248.339 --> 3252.24
right

3250.079 --> 3254.6400000000003
and maybe the same goes for own Benjamin

3252.24 --> 3256.859
I mean at that time he's he's probably

3254.64 --> 3259.0789999999997
just waking up and milking his goats

3256.859 --> 3260.339
he's not gonna do a live show exactly at

3259.079 --> 3263.3
that time

3260.339 --> 3263.2999999999997
there's no way

3264.68 --> 3270.3799999999997
they might listen if he could barely

3267.66 --> 3270.3799999999997
hear my voice

3276.78 --> 3280.26
me and my spiritual healer yeah good

3278.94 --> 3282.66
luck

3280.26 --> 3284.9
he's he's not very good at speaking

3282.66 --> 3284.8999999999996
English

3285.66 --> 3291.0589999999997
it would be really annoying and besides

3289.02 --> 3294.0
like

3291.059 --> 3297.2400000000002
here has in many ways a radically

3294.0 --> 3298.559
different way of thinking

3297.24 --> 3302.18
and

3298.559 --> 3302.1800000000003
we know that about each other

3302.22 --> 3308.64
so I like have to translate my ideas

3305.88 --> 3310.079
towards him

3308.64 --> 3312.839
and

3310.079 --> 3315.0
it works that way

3312.839 --> 3317.339
it's yeah

3315.0 --> 3319.98
and I don't want to put he doesn't want

3317.339 --> 3322.2599999999998
to come on camera

3319.98 --> 3324.2400000000002
my healer or or like he doesn't want to

3322.26 --> 3328.76
be part of the internet really

3324.24 --> 3328.7599999999998
I think he overall avoids the internet

3330.599 --> 3338.9
he doesn't like he does classes he does

3333.839 --> 3338.9
actual face to face discussions rather

3339.599 --> 3345.839
and he teaches like he teaches well

3342.839 --> 3347.7599999999998
these things that he practices like how

3345.839 --> 3349.7999999999997
they learn that I actually you kind of

3347.76 --> 3352.2000000000003
want to learn that

3349.8 --> 3356.48
but yeah that costs and I would have to

3352.2 --> 3356.48
travel through throughout the country

3357.48 --> 3361.38
but my dad also suggested that some time

3360.48 --> 3363.72
ago

3361.38 --> 3366.059
I I would love to do something like that

3363.72 --> 3367.9199999999996
just to get out and actually see people

3366.059 --> 3370.92
face to face that would already be

3367.92 --> 3373.5
helpful and I might be able to

3370.92 --> 3376.6800000000003
with the help of well a whole bunch of

3373.5 --> 3379.8
strong people even helped to rearrange

3376.68 --> 3384.0
some of my internal workings that I find

3379.8 --> 3387.54
extremely obstructive obstructive

3384.0 --> 3391.94
that I just cannot seem to be able to

3387.54 --> 3391.94
get a grip on just by my own

3393.059 --> 3400.5
never happened to the Dutch sailor dude

3395.66 --> 3403.5
yeah he went he went nuts steamage he

3400.5 --> 3407.24
even ended up like threatening me

3403.5 --> 3407.24
the guy is unstable

3408.78 --> 3414.0
and we like he just at some point just

3412.02 --> 3417.5
suddenly started I don't know get

3414.0 --> 3417.5
paranoid toward me or something

3428.94 --> 3435.18
right yeah but it's too bad because it

3432.839 --> 3438.119
was he was a pretty cool guy

3435.18 --> 3440.16
but he I mean he had some serious issues

3438.119 --> 3442.02
but he knew that and he was being honest

3440.16 --> 3443.04
I mean he was really trying to be a good

3442.02 --> 3445.559
guy

3443.04 --> 3448.2
but he does get like serious Savannah

3445.559 --> 3451.8190000000004
syndrome where he just gets really

3448.2 --> 3451.819
paranoid and then he just

3452.04 --> 3456.5589999999997
starts seeing that in everybody

3461.46 --> 3466.2
so I don't know maybe he'll be back at

3463.38 --> 3469.38
some point I mean

3466.2 --> 3470.7
he's not the first person to have those

3469.38 --> 3474.2400000000002
issues

3470.7 --> 3477.24
to basically blow up in my face

3474.24 --> 3481.02
and then abandon

3477.24 --> 3483.7799999999997
it's not the first person to do that

3481.02 --> 3487.2599999999998
and in a way I get it because when

3483.78 --> 3491.1600000000003
people get unstable like that

3487.26 --> 3494.76
then I get defensive eventually

3491.16 --> 3497.22
I don't have super amounts of patience

3494.76 --> 3501.7400000000002
I'm going to be like my tactic against

3497.22 --> 3501.74
that is just be strict and just say nope

3502.859 --> 3510.2
I'm not going to indulge that

3505.2 --> 3510.2
I'm gonna make it about you in this case

3517.26 --> 3520.2200000000003
okay

3523.74 --> 3528.0589999999997
uh

3525.66 --> 3530.52
I really hope you are fully joking

3528.059 --> 3532.7400000000002
though but it's hilarious Owen is too

3530.52 --> 3533.46
much of a smuck cult leader to talk to

3532.74 --> 3536.66
you

3533.46 --> 3539.099
sorry I am a gamma now I know

3536.66 --> 3542.0589999999997
thank you for that

3539.099 --> 3542.059
hello Brandon

3563.28 --> 3567.0
can you be verified as it's not a cold

3566.04 --> 3570.0589999999997
bear

3567.0 --> 3572.76
very funny Godzilla hello blue pill

3570.059 --> 3575.599
Evolution hello a lot of people

3572.76 --> 3575.599
moving in

3578.46 --> 3582.14
winter doldrums

3582.24 --> 3587.4599999999996
could yeah sure I mean it is very

3584.46 --> 3590.94
typical during winter period

3587.46 --> 3595.079
it's just that I've been great

3590.94 --> 3598.44
but yesterday night like that situation

3595.079 --> 3601.02
with Fox it it just really blew me

3598.44 --> 3603.54
just out of my yeah

3601.02 --> 3607.339
it blew my spirit out of my body I just

3603.54 --> 3607.339
did not expect that to happen and

3611.64 --> 3616.319
I had I I guess you could say

3613.92 --> 3618.42
asiderically I presented myself too

3616.319 --> 3621.599
vulnerable

3618.42 --> 3623.88
to this man that I don't think you can

3621.599 --> 3628.339
really

3623.88 --> 3628.339
I don't think he deals well with empaths

3639.839 --> 3644.819
interesting to meet my dad well that

3642.839 --> 3647.819
might happen

3644.819 --> 3650.04
but on the other hand my dad look my

3647.819 --> 3653.54
dad's actually kind of trying to wean

3650.04 --> 3653.54
off the internet a bit because

3653.64 --> 3659.16
he gets caught up

3656.819 --> 3662.52
and basically

3659.16 --> 3664.0789999999997
like counter propaganda and that is

3662.52 --> 3666.78
disruptive

3664.079 --> 3668.579
like for the business like of my

3666.78 --> 3670.799
stepmother and all that

3668.579 --> 3673.44
it's fair it's like he's

3670.799 --> 3676.559
kind of become had become a little bit

3673.44 --> 3679.26
of a well conspiracy theorist like I was

3676.559 --> 3681.1800000000003
during 9 11. it's very disruptive and so

3679.26 --> 3683.6400000000003
he's like okay I'm just gonna like let

3681.18 --> 3688.2599999999998
it all go a bit

3683.64 --> 3689.64
because it's making me terrible it's

3688.26 --> 3693.3190000000004
very wise of him

3689.64 --> 3696.54
and he also he does trust God he knows

3693.319 --> 3698.16
doesn't need to do he's not really going

3696.54 --> 3700.079
to change a lot

3698.16 --> 3702.1189999999997
and people are just gonna have to go

3700.079 --> 3705.559
through the test

3702.119 --> 3705.559
of everything that's happening

3706.44 --> 3713.18
right but he's not too eager to like get

3709.4 --> 3713.1800000000003
on the internet again

3713.64 --> 3716.64
and on my show that would be very

3715.559 --> 3722.059
unlikely

3716.64 --> 3722.0589999999997
I mean he is a very busy guy actually

3735.72 --> 3738.319
what

3738.839 --> 3743.16
what you put that in this Jet and he

3741.42 --> 3744.78
blocked you

3743.16 --> 3747.48
yeah

3744.78 --> 3750.5
you probably got in there right when he

3747.48 --> 3750.5
was like

3752.46 --> 3757.26
like

3754.079 --> 3760.38
trying to deter waves of Gammas trying

3757.26 --> 3764.0400000000004
to sabotage everything

3760.38 --> 3765.359
it was very very easy on the Banning

3764.04 --> 3767.579
back then

3765.359 --> 3769.68
I think

3767.579 --> 3773.2200000000003
right but I I haven't really seen any

3769.68 --> 3777.799
live shows of him I I just get to see

3773.22 --> 3777.799
after work the upload at bit shoot

3801.72 --> 3804.319
foreign

3854.099 --> 3856.7000000000003
foreign

3926.48 --> 3930.079
and I'm back

4017.599 --> 4020.2000000000003
foreign

4022.52 --> 4027.64
wow I'm just looking through the

4025.16 --> 4027.64
comments

4031.22 --> 4035.98
my shows

4033.02 --> 4035.98
for a bit

4037.339 --> 4040.66
it's pretty incredible

4048.2 --> 4054.68
just some of these things that again I

4051.2 --> 4057.74
say or well but you know what

4054.68 --> 4059.839
I'm not gonna use those words anymore

4057.74 --> 4062.3799999999997
because apparently I don't understand

4059.839 --> 4062.38
them

4063.079 --> 4067.94
so I'm gonna try to figure out another

4065.539 --> 4072.559
way

4067.94 --> 4072.559
of categorizing personalities

4075.38 --> 4080.44
because apparently I I don't understand

4077.299 --> 4080.44
anything about it

4082.0 --> 4086.269
[Music]

4090.72 --> 4094.6899999999996
[Music]

4100.94 --> 4106.66
right maybe I shouldn't just categorize

4104.06 --> 4109.759
people and just

4106.66 --> 4113.0599999999995
just very specifically addressed

4109.759 --> 4115.279
isolated Behavior

4113.06 --> 4119.06
I mean I have been doing that most of

4115.279 --> 4121.160000000001
the times so I'm just gonna not not use

4119.06 --> 4125.080000000001
the word gamma anymore

4121.16 --> 4125.08
I guess it's been overused anyway

4125.96 --> 4133.66
people are stamping gamma on things not

4129.259 --> 4133.66
really thinking it through all that well

4133.759 --> 4138.92
and hey guilty as charged I I definitely

4136.94 --> 4141.339
do that

4138.92 --> 4141.339
between

4142.069 --> 4146.4800000000005
[Music]

4143.42 --> 4148.52
it's it's it's because it's fun in a way

4146.48 --> 4152.239
to just say uh

4148.52 --> 4154.64
somebody's squirting oh that's a gamma

4152.239 --> 4157.58
or you're getting gamma on me but I mean

4154.64 --> 4160.46
that's not what it is really

4157.58 --> 4163.48
I wonder if fox day is actually really

4160.46 --> 4166.64
agitated about everybody

4163.48 --> 4168.699
misapplying his very very carefully

4166.64 --> 4170.2390000000005
crafted

4168.699 --> 4172.9
personality

4170.239 --> 4172.9
system

4176.48 --> 4182.299
he has addressed it before

4179.839 --> 4184.4
yeah I do actually pay attention to that

4182.299 --> 4187.04
sort of thing

4184.4 --> 4192.46
so I'm just going to figure out another

4187.04 --> 4192.46
way to do it and basically detach here

4200.8 --> 4203.859
[Music]

4207.23 --> 4210.9
[Music]

4221.06 --> 4226.219
right because usually what describes

4224.42 --> 4229.4
gamma Behavior

4226.219 --> 4233.36
it's the combination of misery

4229.4 --> 4233.36
and impulsiveness

4235.3 --> 4242.12
impulsivis that there's no objection

4239.6 --> 4245.56
to doing whatever is

4242.12 --> 4245.5599999999995
whatever you're feeling like

4246.26 --> 4253.84
and pursuing miserable things

4250.58 --> 4258.0199999999995
like drag to tear somebody down

4253.84 --> 4261.82
or well usually just that

4258.02 --> 4261.820000000001
or undermining somebody

4266.54 --> 4270.5
right

4267.62 --> 4273.44
so yeah the combination of misery and

4270.5 --> 4276.58
impulsiveness so

4273.44 --> 4276.58
what do you call that

4278.3 --> 4283.58
I guess savonie would do

4281.24 --> 4286.28
[Music]

4283.58 --> 4289.46
maybe to just stick to that word

4286.28 --> 4292.099999999999
savannah it's a complete yeah it's

4289.46 --> 4294.8
technically a nonsense word

4292.1 --> 4298.659000000001
the random weird name

4294.8 --> 4298.659000000001
and its own Benjamin's creation

4301.1 --> 4309.400000000001
that I have kind of hijacked as well

4305.719 --> 4309.4
try to expand upon

4312.92 --> 4317.6
right

4314.54 --> 4321.26
but maybe I need to figure out a

4317.6 --> 4324.6990000000005
designation that is just mine

4321.26 --> 4324.6990000000005
that I come up with

4324.8 --> 4331.46
and don't write on on top of someone

4327.5 --> 4335.199
some other person's popularity

4331.46 --> 4335.199
in their description

4337.64 --> 4340.96
okay Godzilla

4350.78 --> 4353.739
yeah good point

4354.26 --> 4359.169
foreign

4356.13 --> 4359.169
[Music]

4362.33 --> 4365.89
[Music]

4388.719 --> 4393.92
look to this day I still don't even know

4392.6 --> 4396.14
what I am

4393.92 --> 4398.62
I brought it up before like in that

4396.14 --> 4398.62
Spectrum

4401.659 --> 4406.28
I don't know

4403.159 --> 4409.28
I just can't tell

4406.28 --> 4413.86
because I have

4409.28 --> 4413.86
elements of all all of it

4416.36 --> 4421.839999999999
like faces ways of doing things

4426.08 --> 4430.179
and by the way that includes gamma I

4428.48 --> 4434.78
mean

4430.179 --> 4437.6
the way some what I presumed to be gamma

4434.78 --> 4440.96
impulsive and guided by misery

4437.6 --> 4446.06
like I have that in me too

4440.96 --> 4449.86
I just hate gamma so much that I

4446.06 --> 4449.860000000001
refuse to feed it

4450.26 --> 4456.280000000001
it only happens by accident when I get

4453.56 --> 4456.280000000001
really angry

4469.1 --> 4475.9400000000005
right but in the way that I do things

4472.58 --> 4478.82
I'm like almost robotic beta

4475.94 --> 4480.799999999999
but is that bay towers that Delta it's

4478.82 --> 4482.84
just all of it it's like all these

4480.8 --> 4485.62
things it's like yeah I can recognize

4482.84 --> 4485.62
things

4486.199 --> 4492.799999999999
in it so which one am I or am I so

4490.1 --> 4495.6990000000005
freaking unstable that I don't even fit

4492.8 --> 4495.6990000000005
any category

4496.76 --> 4501.14
you are what you were you could yeah

4498.92 --> 4503.0
that's so cute to get to hear that all

4501.14 --> 4504.92
your entire life and every time's like

4503.0 --> 4506.659
what the [ __ ] am I and literally

4504.92 --> 4508.52
everyone yeah you are what you are oh

4506.659 --> 4512.98
thanks so helpful

4508.52 --> 4512.9800000000005
so I mean I know you mean well it's just

4513.76 --> 4516.93
[Music]

4531.56 --> 4536.780000000001
why do I feel the need to put a

4533.9 --> 4538.5199999999995
particular label upon myself that's a

4536.78 --> 4540.5
good question

4538.52 --> 4544.06
uh

4540.5 --> 4544.06
how about to be

4547.46 --> 4551.08
more easily understood

4551.84 --> 4559.46
like if I can see how I am

4556.34 --> 4563.360000000001
then other people

4559.46 --> 4566.679
that see that I can understand better

4563.36 --> 4566.679
what they're seeing

4597.26 --> 4601.42
I report myself in a box

4602.78 --> 4608.719
or if it would be able to then I would

4605.54 --> 4609.86
but I mean it can't seem to fit any

4608.719 --> 4612.88
blocks

4609.86 --> 4612.88
George Sanford

4620.06 --> 4625.120000000001
or maybe I do it's not that clear I mean

4626.659 --> 4633.5599999999995
I'm not getting any

4629.48 --> 4636.759999999999
signs like yeah I mean there you gotta

4633.56 --> 4636.76
realize this and that

4638.44 --> 4642.98
that you do definitely fall into this

4640.94 --> 4645.5
category like I'm not getting any like

4642.98 --> 4647.959999999999
elaborate analysis or anything about

4645.5 --> 4650.8
what people think

4647.96 --> 4650.8
I am

4651.92 --> 4655.78
that's a good thing okay whatever

4670.94 --> 4679.4
who cares what they think you are

4674.48 --> 4680.36
I do well not not that that much but I

4679.4 --> 4683.0
mean

4680.36 --> 4684.139999999999
it would help to understand things

4683.0 --> 4686.179
better

4684.14 --> 4688.280000000001
right that's what I said it's not like

4686.179 --> 4689.96
oh it matters so much how they think

4688.28 --> 4691.639999999999
that's not what I'm saying this is not

4689.96 --> 4694.28
like oh no

4691.64 --> 4696.56
I need to make them feel think better of

4694.28 --> 4699.08
Me no I'm just like

4696.56 --> 4700.280000000001
they understand what people are seeing

4699.08 --> 4704.659
because

4700.28 --> 4708.8
I understand what I am to them typically

4704.659 --> 4712.219
where I fall in place with people then I

4708.8 --> 4714.02
can deal with them better and know what

4712.219 --> 4716.78
to expect better

4714.02 --> 4718.580000000001
and not be bewildered like a situation

4716.78 --> 4721.84
yesterday where I'm thinking like oh

4718.58 --> 4721.84
yeah I'm just oh

4722.42 --> 4725.84
I'm really curious I want to figure this

4724.28 --> 4728.659
out it's going to be this could be that

4725.84 --> 4729.7390000000005
and then get like threatened to get

4728.659 --> 4733.58
banned

4729.739 --> 4736.879999999999
to me out of nowhere yeah because that's

4733.58 --> 4739.46
really jarring and shocking and I still

4736.88 --> 4742.9400000000005
feel miserable because of it the next

4739.46 --> 4746.36
freaking day over just some

4742.94 --> 4751.879999999999
meaningless little event

4746.36 --> 4755.96
that's why because I want to know what

4751.88 --> 4758.96
people think not because I care

4755.96 --> 4762.199
but because I need to know I need to

4758.96 --> 4767.719
understand it in order to avoid these

4762.199 --> 4767.719
unexpected Spirit disrupting situations

4772.13 --> 4775.329
[Music]

4786.14 --> 4789.1
oh Cleary

4796.78 --> 4801.34
but do you guys get my dilemma

4817.94 --> 4823.639999999999
like

4819.14 --> 4827.360000000001
if you have an absolutely no idea

4823.64 --> 4830.9800000000005
what people think of you then how are

4827.36 --> 4830.98
you going to engage them

4834.5 --> 4840.98
like successfully

4837.8 --> 4843.92
when complete random [ __ ] could happen

4840.98 --> 4845.36
that totally ruins things including my

4843.92 --> 4846.92
own mood

4845.36 --> 4849.62
right

4846.92 --> 4855.1990000000005
I need to understand

4849.62 --> 4858.159
I need to figure out what I am to people

4855.199 --> 4858.159
foreign

4893.179 --> 4897.9800000000005
that other people's perception Define

4896.0 --> 4901.1
your interactions

4897.98 --> 4905.32
isn't that the freaking point

4901.1 --> 4905.320000000001
of communication steamy Traveler

4911.719 --> 4917.179
right

4913.34 --> 4920.42
to to know their perception

4917.179 --> 4921.7390000000005
and to then anticipate based on that

4920.42 --> 4925.3
knowledge

4921.739 --> 4925.299999999999
why aren't you seeing this

4952.96 --> 4956.02
all right

4982.12 --> 4986.239
people's perception of you through your

4984.5 --> 4988.659
action yeah that is how it works

4986.239 --> 4988.659
definitely

4990.92 --> 4993.46
of course

4997.64 --> 5001.56
but

4999.08 --> 5001.5599999999995
like

5002.8 --> 5007.900000000001
yeah

5005.32 --> 5011.04
okay steamer Trail we'll see you later

5007.9 --> 5011.04
thanks for popping by

5014.98 --> 5018.879999999999
think about you is none of your best

5016.84 --> 5023.32
what

5018.88 --> 5023.32
what do you mean the studio68

5029.35 --> 5032.409000000001
[Music]

5063.64 --> 5066.96
okay take it

5067.6 --> 5071.7390000000005
can't worry about yeah but I'm not

5069.52 --> 5076.4400000000005
talking about worrying

5071.739 --> 5076.44
this is a thing you guys are like

5077.28 --> 5081.759999999999
misplacing

5079.239 --> 5083.98
the intention I'm not

5081.76 --> 5086.320000000001
I don't want to hear what they think

5083.98 --> 5088.54
about it because I could get hysterical

5086.32 --> 5091.719
like some hysterical woman or something

5088.54 --> 5095.34
okay I want to know about it so I can

5091.719 --> 5095.34
just size up

5097.0 --> 5100.62
how to do things

5101.199 --> 5104.669999999999
yeah

5102.82 --> 5106.719
it's called anticipation

5104.67 --> 5108.82
[Music]

5106.719 --> 5112.6
if you don't know

5108.82 --> 5115.92
how people see you then how can you

5112.6 --> 5115.92
anticipate anything

5119.699 --> 5123.0599999999995
thank you

5133.0 --> 5136.86
just don't care well that's fine

5137.26 --> 5141.820000000001
I'm not saying you should care I'm not

5140.02 --> 5144.88
saying I care

5141.82 --> 5146.259999999999
like emotionally feeling wise that I

5144.88 --> 5149.62
care

5146.26 --> 5153.400000000001
yeah I for that part of me has been like

5149.62 --> 5153.4
pretty much extinguished

5154.42 --> 5160.42
for a long time

5156.94 --> 5163.138999999999
I've put myself in the isolation spot

5160.42 --> 5163.139
like that

5163.179 --> 5168.159
in a way

5164.56 --> 5169.659000000001
throughout a lot of my years

5168.159 --> 5173.92
yeah

5169.659 --> 5176.799999999999
so I don't effectively care in order for

5173.92 --> 5181.36
my drive or whatever

5176.8 --> 5182.9800000000005
I care for practical purposes

5181.36 --> 5185.98
to know

5182.98 --> 5188.4
to just understand better how to do

5185.98 --> 5188.4
things

5189.58 --> 5192.48
socially

5194.6 --> 5202.72
[Music]

5240.04 --> 5244.6
right because

5242.139 --> 5246.58
yeah come over that's a good point

5244.6 --> 5248.320000000001
the difference between being aware of

5246.58 --> 5253.08
something and caring or being worried

5248.32 --> 5253.08
about it right because hey

5253.96 --> 5261.34
I can if I just know

5258.34 --> 5264.04
and I can like see even like how they

5261.34 --> 5267.1
are emotioned or whatever

5264.04 --> 5270.4
then I can figure out just how it works

5267.1 --> 5273.58
how they see things in their different

5270.4 --> 5276.159
states and how they see me in their

5273.58 --> 5278.5599999999995
different states just like I see things

5276.159 --> 5282.48
differently in my different states and

5278.56 --> 5282.4800000000005
talk about it all the freaking time

5288.48 --> 5294.28
this I seem to be like one of the very

5291.88 --> 5296.9800000000005
very few people in the world that

5294.28 --> 5299.98
actually just does that

5296.98 --> 5302.199
studies like the

5299.98 --> 5304.36
how it is in different states how you

5302.199 --> 5307.839999999999
see things in different states and how

5304.36 --> 5311.92
it changes and how it can quickly change

5307.84 --> 5314.679
I'm very interested in it in perception

5311.92 --> 5320.159
in like the perception of Consciousness

5314.679 --> 5320.159
itself it fascinates me enormously

5336.699 --> 5341.32
right

5338.86 --> 5344.38
because if I get to understand it better

5341.32 --> 5346.96
through different types of people then I

5344.38 --> 5349.6
get to understand the overall social

5346.96 --> 5352.84
functioning of humanity the mechanisms

5349.6 --> 5356.4400000000005
of it better all of it

5352.84 --> 5357.6990000000005
and then I can compose myself much more

5356.44 --> 5362.678999999999
perfectly

5357.699 --> 5366.46
to be presenting myself more adapted

5362.679 --> 5368.679
to unique individual situations with

5366.46 --> 5370.54
like oh this type of person that type of

5368.679 --> 5371.92
person this is how they will typically

5370.54 --> 5374.139
think

5371.92 --> 5375.52
when they're in that state so this is

5374.139 --> 5376.78
the state for that person that's the

5375.52 --> 5378.280000000001
state of that person this is what

5376.78 --> 5380.46
they're probably going to think in that

5378.28 --> 5380.46
direction

5383.02 --> 5387.120000000001
it's incredibly useful

5398.98 --> 5401.759999999999
you know

5402.58 --> 5405.78
that's right Clary

5410.8 --> 5416.38
let's keep them at a distance

5413.32 --> 5418.12
yeah but yeah right blue pill the blue

5416.38 --> 5421.139
but it's also because a lot of people

5418.12 --> 5421.139
out there

5422.02 --> 5428.1990000000005
are just like they're people that don't

5424.96 --> 5430.3
have a lot of like serious things on

5428.199 --> 5431.98
their mind that are like really caught

5430.3 --> 5435.219
up in the soup

5431.98 --> 5436.48
of mainstream programming nonsense

5435.219 --> 5439.12
like

5436.48 --> 5441.699
they're kind of used to like getting in

5439.12 --> 5443.86
each other's face very up close

5441.699 --> 5446.138999999999
because they don't actually get

5443.86 --> 5448.0
assaulted by people that are very

5446.139 --> 5450.159000000001
seriously try to manipulate them because

5448.0 --> 5451.84
they are literally not a threat because

5450.159 --> 5453.4
they're so immersed within the

5451.84 --> 5455.8
programming

5453.4 --> 5458.5
so they get used to just getting in

5455.8 --> 5461.02
people's face up close

5458.5 --> 5463.12
and then they don't understand why you

5461.02 --> 5467.320000000001
would even object to that

5463.12 --> 5470.739
well it's because you hold information

5467.32 --> 5474.5199999999995
that is a threat to groups outside and

5470.739 --> 5476.919999999999
they will if you are just that open

5474.52 --> 5479.080000000001
try to seek you out

5476.92 --> 5481.36
and then damage you and that's why you

5479.08 --> 5482.739
have that protection

5481.36 --> 5485.0199999999995
but there's

5482.739 --> 5487.659
hordes of people out there

5485.02 --> 5489.76
that never get in that point because

5487.659 --> 5491.92
they're just so going along with the

5489.76 --> 5494.110000000001
flow that they're not seemed as a threat

5491.92 --> 5497.56
nobody psychologically assaults them

5494.11 --> 5499.9
[Music]

5497.56 --> 5502.900000000001
or highlights them in a personal way

5499.9 --> 5505.44
because they're all just going along

5502.9 --> 5505.44
anyway

5507.52 --> 5511.96
and yeah it might be a bit of a flat

5510.159 --> 5513.46
earther thing because of course flat

5511.96 --> 5515.44
earthers have that

5513.46 --> 5518.38
defense mechanism because people

5515.44 --> 5520.48
literally act like they're your friends

5518.38 --> 5522.58
and then try to get in your head and

5520.48 --> 5525.5199999999995
then humiliate you from a baller

5522.58 --> 5527.98
perspective so yeah it's very logical

5525.52 --> 5533.219
that you are

5527.98 --> 5533.218999999999
not so openly trusting forward

5538.659 --> 5543.46
I mean I do it

5540.76 --> 5548.62
because

5543.46 --> 5551.88
while doing it I can still deal

5548.62 --> 5551.88
with a lot of it

5558.4 --> 5562.9
it's a letter there's a repair yeah why

5560.5 --> 5564.699
would that be huh what could it be

5562.9 --> 5566.199
because they're constantly getting

5564.699 --> 5568.9
haunted

5566.199 --> 5570.28
by religious zealots

5568.9 --> 5572.138999999999
that just

5570.28 --> 5575.739
do everything in their power to

5572.139 --> 5577.900000000001
humiliate and mock them

5575.739 --> 5582.239
I mean yeah when that happens to

5577.9 --> 5582.239
somebody they get a little paranoid

5600.6 --> 5610.320000000001
well getting wisdom where where are you

5604.659 --> 5610.32
prepared and when you're not what

5615.52 --> 5619.92
what does that mean I don't get it

5622.06 --> 5626.819

5623.55 --> 5626.819
[Music]

5631.08 --> 5635.0199999999995

5633.34 --> 5637.4800000000005
character and usually not for the best

5635.02 --> 5640.3
well that's because you're sadly tapping

5637.48 --> 5643.48
out of the comfortable Easy Flow of

5640.3 --> 5645.639
nonsense where everybody just drifts on

5643.48 --> 5647.919999999999
and then you have to face reality and

5645.639 --> 5649.2390000000005
the bitter sides of it and that then

5647.92 --> 5652.2390000000005
brings out

5649.239 --> 5654.28
the less favorable characteristics that

5652.239 --> 5658.419999999999
pretty much

5654.28 --> 5661.599999999999
most people have inside of them right I

5658.42 --> 5666.34
mean even being unpleasant

5661.6 --> 5669.719
is in a way viscerally socially

5666.34 --> 5669.719
a defense mechanism

5681.159 --> 5685.96
right it's very straightforward it's

5683.679 --> 5687.639
just oh you're toxic oh so people are

5685.96 --> 5691.38
gonna stay away from you except those

5687.639 --> 5691.38
that are immune to that toxicity

5691.54 --> 5693.78
foreign

5697.9 --> 5702.159
so you can't get confronted with really

5700.84 --> 5705.6990000000005
calm

5702.159 --> 5709.0
people that will tell you exactly God's

5705.699 --> 5711.299999999999
truth like in a way that it like Burns

5709.0 --> 5714.52
you so if you're just

5711.3 --> 5717.46
being miserable all the time

5714.52 --> 5719.9800000000005
then that you will effectively of be

5717.46 --> 5724.8
able to avoid that kind of scenario from

5719.98 --> 5724.799999999999
happening you and burning your spirit

5725.86 --> 5731.62
for being

5727.719 --> 5734.199
not capable of dealing with that

5731.62 --> 5736.679
that kind of level of Truth

5734.199 --> 5736.678999999999
right

5755.8 --> 5758.839
[Music]

5759.94 --> 5765.96
being shunned by possessed Ballers isn't

5762.4 --> 5765.96
so bad I agree

foreign

5769.2 --> 5774.5199999999995
[Music]

5771.52 --> 5774.52
actually

5776.8 --> 5780.820000000001
it's a little demonic

5779.26 --> 5783.46
at times

5780.82 --> 5787.599999999999
not always

5783.46 --> 5792.58
but when when Ballers get triggered

5787.6 --> 5795.34
because of Flat Earth facts yeah they do

5792.58 --> 5797.5
actually kind of start to act like being

5795.34 --> 5799.54
possessed a little

5797.5 --> 5802.679
and the more you push it the more that

5799.54 --> 5807.28
comes out so yeah I agree

5802.679 --> 5810.9
I totally agree blue belt evolution

5807.28 --> 5810.9
it is like getting possessed

5814.67 --> 5819.58
[Music]

5816.28 --> 5822.34
right through the surrender to the LIE

5819.58 --> 5823.7
through the keeping yourself ignorant oh

5822.34 --> 5826.360000000001
mechanized inside

[Music]

5826.36 --> 5833.5
crew never resolving issues

5830.5 --> 5836.62
and leaving it like it is yet still

5833.5 --> 5838.54
leaning heavily upon the Assumption of

5836.62 --> 5842.679
the cohesion of your

5838.54 --> 5842.679
of your intellectual

pond

5845.62 --> 5850.9
[Music]

5847.84 --> 5853.96
of information right you don't finish it

5850.9 --> 5856.96
up but yet you still lean heavily on the

5853.96 --> 5859.06
assumption that it's cohesive

5856.96 --> 5862.02
and you can't reason it out because when

5859.06 --> 5862.02
you do it doesn't fit

5865.54 --> 5870.82
yeah if you do that if you keep doing

5868.0 --> 5875.02
that resting on something

5870.82 --> 5878.199
that shouldn't be rested upon then

5875.02 --> 5880.659000000001
you will start to demand your internal

5878.199 --> 5882.759999999999
ego will demand that it be kept like

5880.659 --> 5885.94
that and you will start to

5882.76 --> 5890.7390000000005
show demonic traits in order to protect

5885.94 --> 5895.08
it I mean this is like Spirit mechanics

5890.739 --> 5895.08
it's very logical how this all works

5900.699 --> 5904.12
whoever's gonna say the same thing about

5902.32 --> 5906.699
Flat Earth there's no you can't

5904.12 --> 5908.0199999999995
because flat earthers can literally or

5906.699 --> 5910.98
Reason out

5908.02 --> 5914.38
their train of thinking with actual

5910.98 --> 5916.839999999999
consistent empirical data

5914.38 --> 5920.1990000000005
and historical references

5916.84 --> 5922.719
globers just use math which is not a

5920.199 --> 5925.36
proper logical Foundation doesn't

5922.719 --> 5930.28
actually prove anything

5925.36 --> 5933.46
and that is part of what we throw at you

5930.28 --> 5936.159
like it doesn't work

5933.46 --> 5938.02
you don't it doesn't actually work when

5936.159 --> 5939.159
you really try to put it together it

5938.02 --> 5941.5
doesn't work

5939.159 --> 5943.9
what flat earthers do

5941.5 --> 5945.34
when they are put on the spot to put it

5943.9 --> 5948.159
together and we do this continually

5945.34 --> 5950.1990000000005
because we're constantly being put on

5948.159 --> 5954.12
the spot like that we put it together

5950.199 --> 5956.919999999999
and it does fit and it does match

5954.12 --> 5958.719
actual writing and history and that's

5956.92 --> 5963.659
the difference

5958.719 --> 5963.659
yeah so it's not the same at all

5964.9 --> 5969.839999999999
I mean globers can say it but it

5967.12 --> 5969.84
wouldn't be true

5969.94 --> 5974.62
yeah Globus can say it about bladder but

5972.52 --> 5976.6
it's not true and I just explained why

5974.62 --> 5980.139
which is a typical Flat Earth trait

5976.6 --> 5984.58
where you when asked elaborately and

5980.139 --> 5989.5
detailed point out exactly why

5984.58 --> 5993.46
with logical consistent argumentation

5989.5 --> 5996.76
something that Ballers don't do they go

5993.46 --> 5999.1
off on tangent spin stories distract

5996.76 --> 6001.139
away from the foundation you don't

5999.1 --> 6003.6
address the foundation because there is

6001.139 --> 6005.76
no Foundation it doesn't fit

6003.6 --> 6009.92
that's the global tactic it's a

6005.76 --> 6009.92
fundamentally different approach

6011.29 --> 6015.14
[Music]

6017.639 --> 6022.56
yeah what Ballers do is they rest upon

6020.82 --> 6026.12
the assumption that it all fits together

6022.56 --> 6028.1990000000005
and then they go off on a tangent on a

6026.12 --> 6031.139
an extreme

6028.199 --> 6033.659
extremely presuppositional speculation

6031.139 --> 6035.46
and then just fantasize about that and

6033.659 --> 6038.099999999999
figure out like oh how does this math

6035.46 --> 6040.56
fit in that method overlooking that none

6038.1 --> 6042.92
of it actually fits downstairs at the

6040.56 --> 6042.92
foundation

6045.6 --> 6051.7390000000005
that's what clovers do

6048.36 --> 6051.739
it's what Baldwin does

6052.199 --> 6058.0199999999995
Baldwin knows it doesn't actually fit

6055.56 --> 6060.900000000001
but he also knows that as long as you

6058.02 --> 6063.900000000001
don't address that you could just

6060.9 --> 6068.46
have fun with it and be very creative

6063.9 --> 6072.138999999999
with all that excessive data

6068.46 --> 6072.139
that is all presuppositional

6094.28 --> 6099.96
if you could prove God there'd be no

6096.719 --> 6101.76
atheist yeah well you can prove God

6099.96 --> 6104.179
and they're still going to be atheists

6101.76 --> 6104.179
you see

6105.06 --> 6110.400000000001
logic doesn't actually matter for what

6108.719 --> 6114.179
people believe

6110.4 --> 6115.138999999999
it only matters for what they believe if

6114.179 --> 6118.5
Dave

6115.139 --> 6121.639
chosen for themselves to have it matter

6118.5 --> 6121.639
for what they believe

6121.739 --> 6127.5
but there's plenty of people that will

6124.619 --> 6130.199
very comfortably lie

6127.5 --> 6131.82
about what they even think logic is

6130.199 --> 6134.46
logical

6131.82 --> 6136.38
and not and like forget that it is that

6134.46 --> 6138.9
they're lying they're just

6136.38 --> 6142.400000000001
cementing it in their way of thinking

6138.9 --> 6142.4
not reasoning about it

6153.9 --> 6158.5199999999995
what you all think or through blowers

6155.699 --> 6162.239
minor screens yeah it's also true

6158.52 --> 6165.179
based on empirical data of social

6162.239 --> 6167.879999999999
interactions with examples

6165.179 --> 6170.28
of that happening for years and years

6167.88 --> 6173.82
and years

6170.28 --> 6177.48
and by analysis of

6173.82 --> 6179.719
things talked about by Ballers on baller

6177.48 --> 6179.718999999999
video

6179.76 --> 6183.84
completely in control of what they're

6181.92 --> 6186.719
saying they have full room nobody's

6183.84 --> 6189.360000000001
putting them on the spot and they do it

6186.719 --> 6191.639
yeah they have all the evidence it's not

6189.36 --> 6193.92
wild speculation what I'm talking about

6191.639 --> 6197.719
here

6193.92 --> 6197.719
this is what happens every time

6199.56 --> 6203.04
yeah

6200.699 --> 6204.78
flat earthers talk about stuff Ballers

6203.04 --> 6206.639
try to get in the way oh prove this

6204.78 --> 6210.84
prove that prove this

6206.639 --> 6214.4400000000005
and then flat earthers will go away to

6210.84 --> 6217.08
actually present foundational truth

6214.44 --> 6219.0599999999995
and then the Ballers will scattergun

6217.08 --> 6221.219
them but what about this and what about

6219.06 --> 6223.5
that and oh you got this wrong oh you

6221.219 --> 6226.5
believe that straw Manning ad homing

6223.5 --> 6228.42
yeah that's what happens and that's very

6226.5 --> 6230.94
specific scenario of a flat earther

6228.42 --> 6233.82
doing something and Ballers getting in

6230.94 --> 6235.919999999999
the way now let's reverse that

6233.82 --> 6239.159
now there's a baller doing something

6235.92 --> 6241.8
online whatever and flat earthers what

6239.159 --> 6243.599999999999
do they do they ask questions

6241.8 --> 6246.2390000000005
right

6243.6 --> 6249.119000000001
questions about the foundation

6246.239 --> 6252.54
an embolish complain uh we already

6249.119 --> 6257.219
addressed that oh it all works out

6252.54 --> 6259.44
not actually fixing it not putting on

6257.219 --> 6261.119
the spot exactly how it works why it

6259.44 --> 6264.178999999999
works so that everybody's cleared up

6261.119 --> 6267.239
that it works no they just hand wave

6264.179 --> 6269.76
dismiss it put it to the side say

6267.239 --> 6271.799999999999
that they fixed it and quickly move on

6269.76 --> 6274.56
to another subject which are very

6271.8 --> 6277.76
eloquent at doing that

6274.56 --> 6277.76
yeah that's the difference

6279.119 --> 6283.4
yeah ballers

6281.699 --> 6286.379999999999
think

6283.4 --> 6289.259999999999
that laying down some math actually

6286.38 --> 6291.92
brings a foundation it doesn't

6289.26 --> 6291.92
at all

6292.8 --> 6297.02
math is nothing but description

6299.699 --> 6304.678999999999
it's not a foundation

6302.04 --> 6307.86
that's the big difference

6304.679 --> 6309.2390000000005
yeah flat earthers don't use math as a

6307.86 --> 6312.54
foundation

6309.239 --> 6315.32
they use actual observation logical

6312.54 --> 6315.32
reasoning

6316.26 --> 6320.0
that's what they use that's the

6317.82 --> 6320.0
difference

6320.76 --> 6325.38
those must be very triggering for a lot

6323.1 --> 6326.860000000001
of you Ballers here in my chat but

6325.38 --> 6330.12
that's what it is

6326.86 --> 6330.12
[Music]

6331.86 --> 6337.139
how it works it's a distinctly different

6334.56 --> 6338.6900000000005
pattern that keeps taking place every

6337.139 --> 6341.89
time and again

6338.69 --> 6341.889999999999
[Music]

6348.0 --> 6351.279
[Music]

6362.88 --> 6365.88
foreign

6369.98 --> 6375.718999999999
good proof then yeah Flex one Black Swan

6374.159 --> 6378.0599999999995
yeah

6375.719 --> 6380.04
the Earth was a ball

6378.06 --> 6382.8
there'd be a hill in the way at the

6380.04 --> 6384.84
Horizon that would be the Horizon oh

6382.8 --> 6386.6990000000005
there's observations at extreme low

6384.84 --> 6391.56
observation height

6386.699 --> 6392.699
spanning vast vast distances which does

6391.56 --> 6394.639
not fit

6392.699 --> 6397.739
The Logical

6394.639 --> 6398.88
geometry that you would observe on a

6397.739 --> 6402.36
ball Earth

6398.88 --> 6405.2390000000005
that's called Black Swan argument

6402.36 --> 6406.5
the Earth was a ball of the assumed size

6405.239 --> 6410.4
to be

6406.5 --> 6413.52
then you would never observe the horizon

6410.4 --> 6415.679
Beyond a certain set distance because of

6413.52 --> 6418.7390000000005
the assumed geometry

6415.679 --> 6423.92
yet we do see

6418.739 --> 6423.919999999999
The Horizon Beyond a certain distance

6425.88 --> 6431.06
which makes the geometry not the ball

6431.46 --> 6437.719
yeah that's evidence

6434.34 --> 6437.719
based on observation

6439.8 --> 6444.4800000000005
no it isn't it is not a

6441.84 --> 6448.56
misrepresentation nor a misunderstanding

6444.48 --> 6452.459999999999
of what globers claim this is The

6448.56 --> 6454.5
Logical consistency of what happens when

6452.46 --> 6457.44
you claim a ball it has certain

6454.5 --> 6461.159
consequences and those consequences are

6457.44 --> 6465.0599999999995
addressed in the Black Swan argument

6461.159 --> 6466.86
and that you don't want to accept that

6465.06 --> 6469.02
it is there and that things can most

6466.86 --> 6471.0599999999995
just refraction without any actual

6469.02 --> 6472.56
physical evidence of that process

6471.06 --> 6474.6
happening

6472.56 --> 6476.639
whatsoever because it's not based on

6474.6 --> 6479.639
actual Optics yeah terrestrial fraction

6476.639 --> 6483.0
not based on Optics at all it's not even

6479.639 --> 6486.659000000001
close not even close

6483.0 --> 6488.46
on how Optics actually work

6486.659 --> 6490.5
I'm not getting into that subject it's

6488.46 --> 6494.159
been treated plenty of times in the last

6490.5 --> 6496.619
few weeks over at flat swords

6494.159 --> 6499.619
especially

6496.619 --> 6501.0599999999995
so you can keep just blabbering on about

6499.619 --> 6504.599999999999
it

6501.06 --> 6505.679
it's done we got a logically consistent

6504.6 --> 6508.320000000001
argument

6505.679 --> 6511.4400000000005
based on your geometric claim of the

6508.32 --> 6514.08
globe which is the claim

6511.44 --> 6517.379999999999
and your rebuttal of terrestrial

6514.08 --> 6519.98
refraction is not based on any empirical

6517.38 --> 6519.9800000000005
evidence

6520.08 --> 6525.6
you have no proof that Optics work that

6522.659 --> 6528.48
way you just presuppose it

6525.6 --> 6532.320000000001
and you even have the goal to just

6528.48 --> 6536.58
utilize terrestrial refraction formula

6532.32 --> 6539.699
with a radius value for the pathway in

6536.58 --> 6542.699
it even though you can't obtain that

6539.699 --> 6546.239
radius value anymore because the Horizon

6542.699 --> 6548.46
is no longer geometric

6546.239 --> 6551.28
so how did you even get that radius

6548.46 --> 6553.26
value you can't if you if you really

6551.28 --> 6555.9
think that it's refracted then you can't

6553.26 --> 6558.860000000001
have a radius value anymore there's no

6555.9 --> 6558.86
way to obtain it

6560.1 --> 6565.56
so it's a dead end

6562.44 --> 6568.98
always was a dead end yeah arwenian

6565.56 --> 6572.76
Paradox is nothing you could do about it

6568.98 --> 6575.699
right even if there were such a

6572.76 --> 6579.06
refraction as you claim then you

6575.699 --> 6581.5199999999995
wouldn't be able to actually figure out

6579.06 --> 6584.580000000001
what it was because you can't get the

6581.52 --> 6586.5
radius value to figure out what it was

6584.58 --> 6588.78
because the radius value can't be

6586.5 --> 6592.92
measured anymore if it was there it's a

6588.78 --> 6595.92
paradox yeah but that's already one

6592.92 --> 6600.42
presupposition too deep because there is

6595.92 --> 6603.96
no evidence of such a form of refraction

6600.42 --> 6606.78
in the Optics studies which are very

6603.96 --> 6609.4800000000005
elaborate on the functioning of light

6606.78 --> 6612.659
through different mediums is a very

6609.48 --> 6616.138999999999
distinct elaborate model for how that

6612.659 --> 6618.36
works using refraction index

6616.139 --> 6620.219
angle of approach of the light angle

6618.36 --> 6622.619
exit

6620.219 --> 6627.42
and it's dependent on

6622.619 --> 6629.94
a radical medium alteration so a

6627.42 --> 6632.9400000000005
distinct separation

6629.94 --> 6636.239
a surface where suddenly the material is

6632.94 --> 6638.04
different yeah well guess what

6636.239 --> 6641.54
that can't work

6638.04 --> 6641.54
over a ball

6642.9 --> 6646.92
when what you're looking through is

6645.36 --> 6649.199
homogeneous

6646.92 --> 6651.179
it makes no sense you're looking for a

6649.199 --> 6652.379999999999
homogeneous layer pretty much the

6651.179 --> 6655.02
density

6652.38 --> 6657.2390000000005
and stuff that's in there on the same

6655.02 --> 6659.88
height is pretty much the same over vast

6657.239 --> 6663.0599999999995
distances right the the gradient is

6659.88 --> 6666.6
vertical it's not horizontal

6663.06 --> 6670.139
so how could any horizontal line

6666.6 --> 6671.9400000000005
visually be bent through one homogeneous

6670.139 --> 6674.4800000000005
median

6671.94 --> 6676.739
without any boundaries

6674.48 --> 6679.08
how's that angle going to change it

6676.739 --> 6682.678999999999
isn't yeah because

6679.08 --> 6685.26
when you look past

6682.679 --> 6686.4
boundaries like that like a piece of

6685.26 --> 6688.679
glass

6686.4 --> 6690.96
piece of glass oh that's like a table

6688.679 --> 6693.2390000000005
right and you look past it guess what's

6690.96 --> 6695.28
gonna happen you're not gonna look

6693.239 --> 6697.98
through

6695.28 --> 6701.5199999999995
the piece of glass

6697.98 --> 6705.119
because the angle is too steep it's too

6701.52 --> 6707.9400000000005
parallel to that Medium alteration

6705.119 --> 6710.719
what's gonna happen instead is it's

6707.94 --> 6715.739
gonna reflect

6710.719 --> 6717.96
reflect not Bend go through it at that

6715.739 --> 6720.36
steep angle and then bend a little more

6717.96 --> 6723.4800000000005
that's not how refraction works at all

6720.36 --> 6727.799999999999
it's the opposite the entire model of

6723.48 --> 6730.799999999999
terrestrial refraction is twisted and

6727.8 --> 6733.860000000001
turned a 90 degrees

6730.8 --> 6735.78
of how refraction actually works it's

6733.86 --> 6737.639
completely insane

6735.78 --> 6739.8
there's no

6737.639 --> 6742.139
functional way

6739.8 --> 6743.88
to back any form of terrestrial

6742.139 --> 6746.88
refraction

6743.88 --> 6748.26
it can't exist Optics don't work that

6746.88 --> 6750.7390000000005
way

6748.26 --> 6750.7390000000005
okay

6751.139 --> 6757.679
so say brick Rock refraction all you

6754.32 --> 6759.299999999999
want it doesn't help it's a fictional

6757.679 --> 6763.28
concept

6759.3 --> 6763.28
refraction doesn't work that way

6765.0 --> 6769.8
yeah

6767.04 --> 6773.159
you can't be parallel

6769.8 --> 6775.38
to that different medium and then look

6773.159 --> 6777.96
through it it's going to reflect

6775.38 --> 6779.58
huh it's reflecting

6777.96 --> 6782.1
you're not going to look through it and

6779.58 --> 6784.58
then have it bent like it doesn't work

6782.1 --> 6784.58
that way

6789.54 --> 6796.199
yeah refraction happens

6792.179 --> 6796.1990000000005
when you look perpendicular

6796.88 --> 6804.0
perpendicular two

6799.44 --> 6806.58
the other medium yeah head on then you

6804.0 --> 6808.639
look through it and then the angle might

6806.58 --> 6812.219
change slightly because you're looking

6808.639 --> 6814.7390000000005
dead on at it yeah

6812.219 --> 6818.159
if you don't look dead on in it you look

6814.739 --> 6820.379999999999
past it maybe slightly down it's going

6818.159 --> 6823.08
to reflect

6820.38 --> 6826.08
that's how that works

6823.08 --> 6827.639
terrestrial refraction cannot possibly

6826.08 --> 6830.639
work

6827.639 --> 6834.5
okay I could not have explained it more

6830.639 --> 6834.5
basic than I just did

6835.86 --> 6841.199
without using any numbers at all I don't

6839.159 --> 6843.619
need to you see

6841.199 --> 6843.619
no

6851.639 --> 6857.2390000000005
globiolus

6854.4 --> 6857.239
uh

6865.5 --> 6870.92
that's [ __ ] Zapped Abby that's

6867.78 --> 6870.92
absolutely not true

6875.699 --> 6880.32
it's not because flat earthers are more

6878.52 --> 6882.4800000000005
arrogant

6880.32 --> 6886.46
that that's why they get attacked by

6882.48 --> 6886.459999999999
Glovers it's absolute horseshit

6887.699 --> 6892.379999999999
and like which prominent Affairs are you

6890.88 --> 6895.159000000001
talking about anyway

6892.38 --> 6900.6
the real prominent F ears

6895.159 --> 6904.638999999999
are usually very very modest and they

6900.6 --> 6904.639
don't get aggressive on Ballers at all

6906.54 --> 6911.1
except maybe on their own show because

6908.52 --> 6914.34
it's an item

6911.1 --> 6916.860000000001
right because it's a direct inquiry it's

6914.34 --> 6919.9800000000005
like being put on a trial on the spot

6916.86 --> 6923.4
it's a thing yeah Nathan Oakley doesn't

6919.98 --> 6926.4
treat Ballers like that out there

6923.4 --> 6929.48
yeah he doesn't get into people's faces

6926.4 --> 6929.48
and act like that

6930.6 --> 6935.9400000000005
oh bomb okay well Bob

6933.719 --> 6936.96
doesn't even interact with Ballers

6935.94 --> 6939.678999999999
really

6936.96 --> 6939.679
at all

6952.199 --> 6956.119
he used to whatever

6957.6 --> 6961.92
yeah

6958.679 --> 6965.159
it's [ __ ] though yeah

6961.92 --> 6970.139
even Nathan Oakley being hard on Ballers

6965.159 --> 6973.379999999999
as he is is not the reason why all flat

6970.139 --> 6975.42
earthers that are open about talking

6973.38 --> 6979.38
about Flat Earth and believing in that

6975.42 --> 6982.5
online it's not because Nathan Oakley is

6979.38 --> 6986.6
being mean to Ballers okay that's the

6982.5 --> 6986.6
most [ __ ] argument I've ever heard

6986.82 --> 6992.759999999999
if Nathan Oakley was not there

6989.94 --> 6996.719
would still be Ballers that would be

6992.76 --> 6999.3
zerging online flat earthers and

6996.719 --> 7001.76
bullying them continually because

6999.3 --> 7003.4400000000005
they've been doing that before Nathan

7001.76 --> 7006.619000000001
Oakley

7003.44 --> 7008.659
has nothing to do with him or any other

7006.619 --> 7012.199
prominent flat earther that might be

7008.659 --> 7014.54
mean to Ballers yeah that's not the

7012.199 --> 7017.659
reason Ballers go out there and nag

7014.54 --> 7020.36
every freaking flat earther online

7017.659 --> 7022.599999999999
that's the dumbest reasoning I've ever

7020.36 --> 7022.599999999999
heard

7056.78 --> 7061.48
yeah I agree Blue Bell Devolution just I

7059.84 --> 7066.82
mean just ignore

7061.48 --> 7066.82
they're just in pure denial spiraling

7066.98 --> 7071.299999999999
it's just

7068.78 --> 7074.44
they're just jacking off there's no

7071.3 --> 7074.4400000000005
point addressing it

7074.96 --> 7080.119
don't try just let them squirt it off

7077.9 --> 7083.598999999999
and forget about it again I mean they're

7080.119 --> 7086.119
religious zealot so that's what they do

7083.599 --> 7089.3
deny deny deny reverse it around now

7086.119 --> 7091.5199999999995
it's all different no no no no we're all

7089.3 --> 7094.179
dead on

7091.52 --> 7097.84
dead on target

7094.179 --> 7097.84
excruciating detail

7098.599 --> 7104.54
and you're just denying everything and

7102.44 --> 7106.879999999999
you're very proficient at it and you've

7104.54 --> 7109.099
got your ritual

7106.88 --> 7111.38
I have to worry myself out and forget

7109.099 --> 7113.42
about all of all of it again so you

7111.38 --> 7116.78
could do the same [ __ ] the next time

7113.42 --> 7118.099
without any burden of memory that you

7116.78 --> 7121.48
were defeated

7118.099 --> 7121.4800000000005
because you don't remember it

7122.06 --> 7127.96
projection yeah get the [ __ ] out good

7124.52 --> 7127.96
more shut the [ __ ] up

7129.47 --> 7135.52
[Music]

7132.26 --> 7135.52
try again next time

7138.9 --> 7142.009999999999
[Music]

7145.28 --> 7150.099
I guess time will tell y'all yeah I know

7150.199 --> 7155.719
it will tell it has told the Earth is

7153.02 --> 7159.56
flat it's not a matter of oh it just

7155.719 --> 7162.08
requires more time no it is flat it's

7159.56 --> 7164.4800000000005
measured flat navigation is based off a

7162.08 --> 7167.38
flat plane

7164.48 --> 7171.138999999999
all Engineers that deal with like

7167.38 --> 7174.9800000000005
trajectories and Pathways ballistics

7171.139 --> 7176.2390000000005
they all know it flat

7174.98 --> 7178.58
and

7176.239 --> 7180.919999999999
don't give a [ __ ]

7178.58 --> 7181.94
that you can't get that through your

7180.92 --> 7185.139
head

7181.94 --> 7185.138999999999
like they don't care

7185.36 --> 7192.46
yeah believe in your [ __ ] Globe

7187.88 --> 7192.46
nobody gives a [ __ ] out there

7208.699 --> 7213.5599999999995
right but I'm gonna round out show full

7211.52 --> 7217.76
two-hour show

7213.56 --> 7219.7390000000005
started a bit slow but I mean a few more

7217.76 --> 7222.6990000000005
energy right now I hope you guys

7219.739 --> 7222.699
appreciated it

7223.58 --> 7228.0199999999995
see this is what I do

7226.34 --> 7230.659000000001
feel bad

7228.02 --> 7233.2390000000005
I put it on the table I lay it down I

7230.659 --> 7234.98
analyze it I ask for inquiry from you

7233.239 --> 7240.5
guys

7234.98 --> 7242.839999999999
then once I feel like I got my sights on

7240.5 --> 7245.179
what it is and how I should regard it

7242.84 --> 7246.38
what I put on the table once I got that

7245.179 --> 7248.4800000000005
figured out

7246.38 --> 7252.46
then we could just move on and literally

7248.48 --> 7252.459999999999
my feelings make me Let It Go

7253.159 --> 7260.0
to more fluid conversation less burdened

7257.06 --> 7262.76
by just emotion

7260.0 --> 7264.199
from my side right so I get more

7262.76 --> 7266.139
expressive

7264.199 --> 7268.799999999999
more fluid

7266.139 --> 7270.92
more on target

7268.8 --> 7273.1990000000005
[Music]

7270.92 --> 7274.6990000000005
a little less careful but I mean that's

7273.199 --> 7275.96
part of it

7274.699 --> 7278.239
right

7275.96 --> 7281.78
so the show definitely ended better than

7278.239 --> 7285.759999999999
it started in that sense right

7281.78 --> 7285.759999999999
anyway I hope you all appreciated it

7286.58 --> 7291.0199999999995
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7289.159 --> 7293.299999999999
like this show if you did then please

7291.02 --> 7295.159000000001
don't forget the rogans it up and if you

7293.3 --> 7297.38
haven't already subscribe to my channel

7295.159 --> 7299.299999999999
and hit the Bell notification so you

7297.38 --> 7301.219
know when I'm going live which is

7299.3 --> 7303.1990000000005
normally 1pm Amsterdam time and a

7301.219 --> 7305.54
weekdays and 2 p.m Amsterdam time in the

7303.199 --> 7307.5199999999995
weekend and please also do support me

7305.54 --> 7309.38
through the PayPal patreon and a

7307.52 --> 7310.96
membership system join button it'll be

7309.38 --> 7314.179
much appreciated

7310.96 --> 7315.679
yeah thank you so much LSG for the

7314.179 --> 7320.179
support

7315.679 --> 7322.58
glad that that you're able to do it

7320.179 --> 7323.599
and I really needed it so that's very

7322.58 --> 7326.659
welcome

7323.599 --> 7328.360000000001
uh right I'll be back tomorrow with flat

7326.659 --> 7331.28
Earth early bird number

7328.36 --> 7333.92
1516 on a Sunday

7331.28 --> 7336.38
uh

7333.92 --> 7338.78
I don't think there's a ball busters

7336.38 --> 7340.34
no yeah there wasn't any ball buses but

7338.78 --> 7341.9
I don't know there might be more the

7340.34 --> 7345.9800000000005
treatment

7341.9 --> 7348.86
Q is really uh like doing the treatments

7345.98 --> 7349.759999999999
recently rather than ball busters and

7348.86 --> 7353.0599999999995
all that

7349.76 --> 7353.06
right uh

7358.54 --> 7361.699
[Music]

7361.94 --> 7366.739
right well gaining wisdom even if it

7364.34 --> 7370.4800000000005
would the game would stop it would still

7366.739 --> 7370.48
continue on in people's minds

7372.679 --> 7377.659
right I mean it's a story

7375.26 --> 7379.219
and even if they stop telling the story

7377.659 --> 7382.96
I mean the story is still going to be

7379.219 --> 7382.96
lingering in people's minds so

7386.0 --> 7391.179
I mean there will be like figures that

7388.699 --> 7394.638999999999
will be like Boomers although probably

7391.179 --> 7396.92
not that generation that are gonna be

7394.639 --> 7399.32
like even if it's like all stopping no

7396.92 --> 7402.38
more balls on TV and all that and it's

7399.32 --> 7405.199
like like completely stopped they will

7402.38 --> 7406.400000000001
still keep going they will still

7405.199 --> 7408.799999999999
just

7406.4 --> 7410.659
assume it's a ball and they will seem a

7408.8 --> 7412.099
little bit demented even about it but

7410.659 --> 7414.5
they're still gonna continue like

7412.099 --> 7416.42
they're not stopping just because it's

7414.5 --> 7418.04
Declassified all of a sudden doesn't

7416.42 --> 7419.42
mean that people are gonna stop

7418.04 --> 7422.54
believing in the ball

7419.42 --> 7424.219
they lived with it all their lives

7422.54 --> 7427.46
anyway

7424.219 --> 7432.19
I was actually a rounding out so until

7427.46 --> 7450.619
the next video keep it flat

7432.19 --> 7453.619
[Music]

7450.619 --> 7453.619
oh

7455.8 --> 7463.47
[Music]
