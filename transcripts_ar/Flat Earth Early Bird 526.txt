206.37 --> 225.9
right now right so long night Friday oh

221.39 --> 230.33999999999997
oh man Owen Benjamin was so good at

225.9 --> 231.51000000000002
night it was just so great this guy I

230.34 --> 234.8
forgot his name

231.51 --> 237.78
that was on with him he did like these

234.8 --> 244.59
impressions impersonations of Ben

237.78 --> 248.97
Shapiro and the other guy's name Jordan

244.59 --> 252.42000000000002
Peterson and just his Ben Shapiro is so

248.97 --> 256.68
spot-on it's crazy and he went so into

252.42 --> 261.65999999999997
it that at some point it was just

256.68 --> 264.54
surreal like that was Ben Shapiro and he

261.66 --> 267.18
was just kind of like answering like Ben

264.54 --> 268.92
Shapiro would if Ben Shapiro prevent the

267.18 --> 271.22
real Ben Shapiro would of course dr. red

268.92 --> 274.89000000000004
herring and play victim more and more

271.22 --> 277.38000000000005
but like if Ben Shapiro was forthcoming

274.89 --> 280.82
that was exactly like what it would have

277.38 --> 283.53
been it was so perfect it's just surreal

280.82 --> 291.9
was a better Ben Shapiro than Ben

283.53 --> 296.27
Shapiro the real one yeah it it kept me

291.9 --> 296.27
up for a while and it was hilarious

297.34 --> 300.46
[Music]

306.12 --> 318.0
yeah Oh what was the name again

310.27 --> 318.0
oh yeah Jim Bob that's right yeah

322.78 --> 330.07
right so yeah it wasn't much um

326.52 --> 331.65999999999997
the Flat Earth debate yesterday like I

330.07 --> 333.55
did come on with the housekeeping and

331.66 --> 336.01000000000005
all that but I kind of slipped away and

333.55 --> 337.63
I thought I was gonna be away for 20

336.01 --> 340.84
minutes and that turned out to be like

337.63 --> 343.15
two hours it's extremely annoying really

340.84 --> 345.52
because I was just gonna get some

343.15 --> 348.03999999999996
groceries a couple of things but there

345.52 --> 352.65999999999997
was constantly waiting rows everywhere

348.04 --> 355.45000000000005
it was so annoying and you could

352.66 --> 357.70000000000005
literally see that the people in there

355.45 --> 360.46
were just taking their time like oh yeah

357.7 --> 362.55
I got much more room so like I'm now

360.46 --> 365.71
just gonna make a long conversation

362.55 --> 372.73
that's really annoying when there's just

365.71 --> 374.2
people waiting this yeah so literally

372.73 --> 380.05
that just kept me waiting and waiting

374.2 --> 382.45
awaiting so I missed like the entire

380.05 --> 386.68
show and the after show unfortunately

382.45 --> 389.21999999999997
was just there on mute it was a bit of a

386.68 --> 389.22
bummer for me

394.03 --> 405.90999999999997
hmm right what else was I doing

400.25 --> 405.91
waiting rows aligned uh right aligned

409.97 --> 416.09000000000003
that's funny waiting row is like a

414.2 --> 418.52
literal the way you say it in Dutch

416.09 --> 420.16999999999996
translated to English and I guess it is

418.52 --> 427.46
technically correct but it's called a

420.17 --> 429.53000000000003
line in general I don't know you know

427.46 --> 431.09
there's a way of being technically

429.53 --> 435.32
correct with English and very

431.09 --> 438.22999999999996
understandable comprehensible is easy to

435.32 --> 442.19
get and then there is just ways of

438.23 --> 446.36
saying it in certain types of dialects

442.19 --> 447.02
and that is much more difficult to get

446.36 --> 450.08000000000004
that right

447.02 --> 450.08
[Music]

453.0 --> 460.86
so I get what is possible with English

456.9 --> 462.9
and how to come across properly and and

460.86 --> 466.29
even like the power of certain types of

462.9 --> 470.31
words and just what type of depth you

466.29 --> 473.46000000000004
touch upon with it but it's much more

470.31 --> 477.87
difficult to really get the sayings and

473.46 --> 482.46
just the way like the detail that it

477.87 --> 484.34000000000003
goes in dialects is much more deep is

482.46 --> 487.71
much more even in complete social

484.34 --> 491.01
stances it's just it's much more

487.71 --> 492.84
difficult to get all of that you really

491.01 --> 497.27
got to get the feel of it and appreciate

492.84 --> 505.73999999999995
it in order to eventually get that hmm

497.27 --> 509.64
right anyway yeah then there's yeah the

505.74 --> 512.01
endless amount of dialects and like new

509.64 --> 514.56
one actually form it's almost like a

512.01 --> 518.099
something that just naturally happens

514.56 --> 523.3699999999999
and it's funny because when I was young

518.099 --> 527.0400000000001
like my creativity made me kind of

523.37 --> 529.74
tinker on making our own dial it's like

527.04 --> 531.99
a I guess it's like a kid thing I guess

529.74 --> 534.8100000000001
where you make your own languages you

531.99 --> 536.64
know it's like even done in kids movies

534.81 --> 541.1099999999999
in that and they always make it

536.64 --> 544.3199999999999
extremely silly like really Oh kids you

541.11 --> 546.57
know like that like really silly that

544.32 --> 548.37
you're like either oh I get it

546.57 --> 551.3100000000001
it's dumb but it's like a kid

548.37 --> 555.39
fantasizing this or that or that you're

551.31 --> 557.6999999999999
like oh that's so lame well I used to do

555.39 --> 561.39
that kind of thing but like really work

557.7 --> 564.4200000000001
on it like make it a very serious act

561.39 --> 566.4
and that's kind of like complex and like

564.42 --> 568.05
a puzzle to people I would puzzle a lot

566.4 --> 572.06
of people with that with what I was

568.05 --> 572.06
doing with the words

574.08 --> 579.72
and I bait I would also kind of use my

577.08 --> 583.9200000000001
own insights a little bit weaponized to

579.72 --> 588.45
brag with and it's not good but yeah I

583.92 --> 592.8199999999999
was very insecure technically so I would

588.45 --> 595.32
use my intelligence like to really

592.82 --> 598.4100000000001
compact it in a moment and roll out

595.32 --> 600.0300000000001
something incredible just basically so

598.41 --> 602.76
I'll show them like I'm more intelligent

600.03 --> 605.6999999999999
than you but that's actually really

602.76 --> 607.77
insecure thing to do so what I learned

605.7 --> 611.5200000000001
out of that eventually but it did kind

607.77 --> 619.9499999999999
of work out back then because yeah it's

611.52 --> 622.8299999999999
not a bluff that's why it's just not a

619.95 --> 627.33
proper way to go about when wielding

622.83 --> 633.69
that type of power right that's what you

627.33 --> 636.72
do in your youth uh alright Missouri

633.69 --> 640.4100000000001
Bear Fox day yeah yeah I followed some

636.72 --> 643.1700000000001
of his and he's very well-read and into

640.41 --> 646.73
language so yeah that's one of the

643.17 --> 646.7299999999999
things I appreciate his channel for

648.56 --> 661.1099999999999
what's my thought on censoring well what

651.9 --> 663.24
do you think you know it's complex like

661.11 --> 667.0500000000001
what is technically what is censorship

663.24 --> 669.72
and what is effectively censorship and

667.05 --> 671.6999999999999
what is with with it what a censorship

669.72 --> 673.95
in the mind of people or what people

671.7 --> 678.84
generally think of censorship is when

673.95 --> 682.94
they get deleted or something you know

678.84 --> 682.94
or kept it blocked

683.55 --> 688.1999999999999
or even timed out it's kind of

686.22 --> 690.8100000000001
considered censorship for the more

688.2 --> 694.589
trollish types that are really pushy but

690.81 --> 699.0
is that technically censorship not

694.589 --> 703.5290000000001
really because real censorship is is

699.0 --> 705.54
kind of based on government it's real

703.529 --> 711.269
censorship is when you don't get a

705.54 --> 713.0999999999999
choice or you break the law type of

711.269 --> 717.36
situation then it becomes real

713.1 --> 720.86
censorship I think but yeah because of

717.36 --> 725.49
technology and just management and

720.86 --> 727.6800000000001
through the the corporate approach it

725.49 --> 730.26
yeah there is just moderation and all

727.68 --> 732.5999999999999
that and that is effectively censorship

730.26 --> 733.98
and it's very easy to politicize it and

732.6 --> 737.519
the problem is because it is the

733.98 --> 738.39
corporate there is legally not a lot you

737.519 --> 741.63
can do about it

738.39 --> 745.68
technically what should why it should be

741.63 --> 747.87
sort of allowed officially is because

745.68 --> 753.2399999999999
then you could step to other platforms

747.87 --> 757.74
and choose with your with your personal

753.24 --> 759.63
investment but for that to work it's

757.74 --> 763.17
like the original capitalist kind of

759.63 --> 767.07
idea there has to be viable alternatives

763.17 --> 769.76
well now oh it's kind of a monolithic

767.07 --> 773.13
situation it's a media monopoly type

769.76 --> 775.41
situation really because the really huge

773.13 --> 778.8
platforms with all the power and all the

775.41 --> 782.01
connections are all kind of in on the

778.8 --> 785.52
same kind of scheme same politicization

782.01 --> 789.47
same techniques and there's no real

785.52 --> 798.199
viable alternative and they get they get

789.47 --> 801.9300000000001
kind of pushed around too so yeah then

798.199 --> 804.269
then censorship when then the companies

801.93 --> 808.25
are kind of monolithic then when they

804.269 --> 811.05
apply their moderation is it still just

808.25 --> 813.959
moderation because yeah it when you

811.05 --> 815.5799999999999
don't have real viable choice then it

813.959 --> 817.4699999999999
really does kind of

815.58 --> 820.5
more like censorship because the

817.47 --> 825.26
authority has been laid to that platform

820.5 --> 828.54
because of its it's monopoly position

825.26 --> 833.3
see it's really difficult to figure that

828.54 --> 837.03
out how and well that is why there's

833.3 --> 840.6899999999999
what's it called again the anti monopoly

837.03 --> 845.3399999999999
laws and it's crazy that these have not

840.69 --> 848.85
been applied what was it again the name

845.34 --> 850.86
of it because in the 90s that was a big

848.85 --> 853.6800000000001
issue everywhere especially like with

850.86 --> 855.9
Bill Gates remember it's constantly

853.68 --> 859.0799999999999
because he was trying to monopolize

855.9 --> 861.09
everything and then destroy like buying

859.08 --> 862.95
up and destroying his competition and

861.09 --> 865.37
what was the name of the type of loss

862.95 --> 865.37
for that

875.57 --> 883.4000000000001
look right but now you're you guys are

879.89 --> 886.53
talking about basically how to moderate

883.4 --> 888.84
like what isn't how do you keep the

886.53 --> 892.89
place orderly what do you want to keep

888.84 --> 894.9300000000001
out right but that that's not really

892.89 --> 898.05
what censorship is about that's about

894.93 --> 900.03
just management censorship really become

898.05 --> 902.76
censorship when you don't have a real

900.03 --> 907.4399999999999
choice when you can't step away from it

902.76 --> 911.16
properly in yeah there should be a

907.44 --> 913.59
viable alternative otherwise it does

911.16 --> 921.63
kind of become censorship in an indirect

913.59 --> 924.72
way that was kind of my point all right

921.63 --> 927.72
speak truth well the thing is with

924.72 --> 931.22
moderation it's up for everyone you can

927.72 --> 934.86
yeah if it is your stream your thing

931.22 --> 938.25
you're like the owner of the channel and

934.86 --> 943.77
and all that then it's completely up to

938.25 --> 946.74
you you can take away chat you know yeah

943.77 --> 949.41
you can get as critical iterally say

946.74 --> 952.14
okay if you don't go doing crazy things

949.41 --> 954.51
say specifically exactly like this you

952.14 --> 956.73
can get as crazy as you like you can

954.51 --> 960.47
bully basically push around in as many

956.73 --> 963.1700000000001
years you like except for well if

960.47 --> 966.45
oversteps the boundaries of what the

963.17 --> 968.43
youtubes management rules are then of

966.45 --> 970.62
course you're gonna get into trouble for

968.43 --> 973.05
that you might get strikes or reported

970.62 --> 976.59
and all that but technically the way you

973.05 --> 980.4
manage your chat is completely free

976.59 --> 984.0300000000001
because it is your personal little

980.4 --> 987.06
corporate kind of private that way space

984.03 --> 991.02
and up to you completely like what do

987.06 --> 992.76
you want to do with it so and yeah if

991.02 --> 995.13
people don't like it they can stay away

992.76 --> 997.23
it's not like there's not an alternative

995.13 --> 1000.4399999999999
out there you know there's thousands of

997.23 --> 1003.02
youtubers live streaming right now so

1000.44 --> 1007.3000000000001
they don't have to hang around if they

1003.02 --> 1009.279
don't like the way I handle my chat

1007.3 --> 1010.93
and that can be in all directions you

1009.279 --> 1013.33
know it can be like oh no he's way too

1010.93 --> 1015.0999999999999
harsh way too harsh like no people

1013.33 --> 1016.6
should just blurt out the craziest

1015.1 --> 1018.49
things because yeah they blurt out crazy

1016.6 --> 1022.0600000000001
things sometimes and yeah there's a

1018.49 --> 1024.88
point to that or you could say no way no

1022.06 --> 1027.55
that's like somebody could we offend it

1024.88 --> 1030.73
or you know you got an every curse word

1027.55 --> 1034.839
has to be has to be removed the time now

1030.73 --> 1040.23
ba bla bla it's completely up to the

1034.839 --> 1044.23
person that owns the channel see and

1040.23 --> 1049.09
that's not censorship because there is a

1044.23 --> 1053.23
lot of other places you can go become

1049.09 --> 1055.33
censorship when there when everything is

1053.23 --> 1058.1200000000001
forcing you to do a certain thing that

1055.33 --> 1060.51
you're not agreeing with that you don't

1058.12 --> 1068.62
like and then there is not no

1060.51 --> 1074.01
alternative on the same level on the

1068.62 --> 1074.01
same kind of platform right

1089.19 --> 1098.0700000000002
right yeah secret Ashman you get it

1091.979 --> 1100.32
indeed hey and I do my best I'm kind of

1098.07 --> 1105.289
nit picky and with the aesthetics you

1100.32 --> 1112.499
know so I try to be as eloquent and and

1105.289 --> 1114.479
good as I can because I have my yea dark

1112.499 --> 1117.509
tendencies as well you know I'm a human

1114.479 --> 1120.1490000000001
being I think that's what happens and

1117.509 --> 1125.269
I'm very passionate and with that also

1120.149 --> 1125.2689999999998
comes like part of the darkness then

1125.539 --> 1133.289
that's something I learned to manage and

1129.84 --> 1135.029
I hope that still to this day people

1133.289 --> 1139.169
that have followed me for a long time

1135.029 --> 1143.22
can see the progress that I that I am

1139.169 --> 1145.71
less wild that my energy may still be

1143.22 --> 1150.679
like strong but that I'm more controlled

1145.71 --> 1150.679
I really hope I am and do my best

1159.12 --> 1161.87
right

1175.15 --> 1183.16
right oh by the way did yesterday was

1180.52 --> 1186.49
really weird like what was up with

1183.16 --> 1188.3200000000002
Cleary remember he suddenly said like in

1186.49 --> 1190.6
the chat like take my wrench away I'm

1188.32 --> 1193.0
gonna leave and all that like what is

1190.6 --> 1195.99
going on with that I still don't know

1193.0 --> 1195.99
why he did that

1201.82 --> 1205.59
it's somebody pick up on that

1216.64 --> 1231.3700000000001
oh he is mm-hmm all right well I really

1228.58 --> 1233.4399999999998
didn't try you know I tried to be very

1231.37 --> 1235.9899999999998
honest in my analysis of what I thought

1233.44 --> 1238.0900000000001
about the situation and it's blatantly

1235.99 --> 1241.21
obvious that I don't trust Randi because

1238.09 --> 1244.62
of the past and I don't forget these

1241.21 --> 1249.6100000000001
things and I've told it like no no

1244.62 --> 1252.6999999999998
you're not gonna fool me with things and

1249.61 --> 1258.2199999999998
not push me around because I'm not I'm

1252.7 --> 1263.799
not as gullible so it was with that and

1258.22 --> 1266.799
that's all and just I get it if people

1263.799 --> 1268.4189999999999
are a fan of him I guess it's that it is

1266.799 --> 1272.11
kind of interesting from a certain

1268.419 --> 1274.51
perspective you know it's kind of the

1272.11 --> 1277.9799999999998
same reason in a way while I still watch

1274.51 --> 1282.73
Alex Jones even though he is yeah

1277.98 --> 1283.78
like a lot of [ __ ] he gets he really

1282.73 --> 1291.0
does deserve that

1283.78 --> 1291.0
but at the same time it's I don't know

1292.53 --> 1298.36
to me there's still something there but

1295.75 --> 1305.98
I'm very well aware of what he's

1298.36 --> 1309.9699999999998
becoming anyway like just what grabbing

1305.98 --> 1314.679
for the level of influence that he tries

1309.97 --> 1317.1100000000001
to have what that does to you and that

1314.679 --> 1321.97
he probably even really realizes that

1317.11 --> 1326.9699999999998
he's basically emulating parts of his

1321.97 --> 1326.97
soul in what he's doing everybody's just

1327.0 --> 1333.34
yeah it's like an obsession and he kind

1330.91 --> 1337.5400000000002
of feels that in a way it is wrong but

1333.34 --> 1343.1499999999999
he keeps on going and it's yeah so if

1337.54 --> 1347.08
I'm not saying it that that there even

1343.15 --> 1349.3100000000002
in the same way it's just I don't know

1347.08 --> 1352.4299999999998
call it a fascination

1349.31 --> 1354.59
and again sometimes it can still be

1352.43 --> 1356.9
halfway interesting when I hear through

1354.59 --> 1360.37
Alex Jones and I don't know I think that

1356.9 --> 1363.23
his team of the other people are also

1360.37 --> 1367.2199999999998
interesting at time at times especially

1363.23 --> 1372.68
David Knight recently cuz because he's

1367.22 --> 1375.6200000000001
just really going against the stream

1372.68 --> 1377.0900000000001
basically going and that and that is

1375.62 --> 1379.31
also an interesting thing about the

1377.09 --> 1381.6499999999999
whole platform is that Alex Jones does

1379.31 --> 1383.27
allow that he always said that and he he

1381.65 --> 1387.41
does pull through with that so whatever

1383.27 --> 1393.1399999999999
he's doing with his thing it's kind of

1387.41 --> 1394.52
crazy but he lets his other show hosts

1393.14 --> 1397.91
do their own thing

1394.52 --> 1400.1
even if it goes against him and that is

1397.91 --> 1403.01
interesting you know that is kind of

1400.1 --> 1406.01
unique that doesn't happen very often

1403.01 --> 1409.58
with news organizations which Alex Jones

1406.01 --> 1412.64
pretty much hit enforce so see it's

1409.58 --> 1415.1299999999999
there is something interesting for me

1412.64 --> 1417.23
but I completely get it if you guys are

1415.13 --> 1420.65
like oh god not more of that

1417.23 --> 1423.35
advertisement haha that freaking these

1420.65 --> 1425.5900000000001
songs are echoing in my head yes I know

1423.35 --> 1431.1799999999998
I know

1425.59 --> 1433.6399999999999
trust me it's not for everyone I just

1431.18 --> 1437.8700000000001
had this training for 20 years and now

1433.64 --> 1440.63
it's kind of hard to drop it 20 years

1437.87 --> 1449.83
that's not true I started watching it

1440.63 --> 1453.47
like 2008 right so it's 12 years anyway

1449.83 --> 1455.4199999999998
so I totally get it if people absolutely

1453.47 --> 1459.44
want to follow Randy and even want to

1455.42 --> 1463.8200000000002
support him it's just that there is some

1459.44 --> 1468.4
weird [ __ ] going on especially with this

1463.82 --> 1468.3999999999999
money shoveling and it's just

1470.44 --> 1473.579
[Music]

1474.74 --> 1484.59
it doesn't feel right to me and hey hey

1479.46 --> 1487.74
it's not like yeah I know for example

1484.59 --> 1490.05
with Alex Jones that sort of thing well

1487.74 --> 1493.3700000000001
not literally like but issues in

1490.05 --> 1496.32
lawsuits and now he has a lot of like

1493.37 --> 1498.36
fake news lawsuits against him from the

1496.32 --> 1501.26
deep state blah blah blah you could call

1498.36 --> 1505.32
it like that issues but there's also

1501.26 --> 1507.99
some like family issues and yeah and

1505.32 --> 1513.8999999999999
then it shows that he's not a perfect

1507.99 --> 1517.65
guy at all but yeah that's kind of known

1513.9 --> 1520.2
I know that too and it's not really my

1517.65 --> 1522.63
business you know that's the issue it's

1520.2 --> 1524.91
like hey it's his freakin family you

1522.63 --> 1527.5500000000002
know and his kids are gonna remember all

1524.91 --> 1530.6100000000001
that so yeah good luck with that but

1527.55 --> 1537.12
when it comes to Randy and the Flat

1530.61 --> 1541.2299999999998
Earth community around us people hey-ya

1537.12 --> 1543.84
people like Roxanne yeah I know Roxanne

1541.23 --> 1549.98
I met her face to face and she's a

1543.84 --> 1554.37
really nice passionate interesting woman

1549.98 --> 1558.84
that really is all in on Flat Earth like

1554.37 --> 1560.61
she she knows she's on the long run she

1558.84 --> 1564.57
could potentially risk a lot and she's

1560.61 --> 1567.03
like really dedicated so I don't want to

1564.57 --> 1571.1899999999998
see her get toppled or anything and that

1567.03 --> 1575.57
way it's somebody I know so that is why

1571.19 --> 1575.5700000000002
it's more come more personal

1578.12 --> 1583.7199999999998
now because these people also know me

1584.11 --> 1589.57
right anyway

1585.799 --> 1589.57
oh yeah Cleary

1593.76 --> 1604.2
Reilly's work for Cleary and and I'm

1597.63 --> 1606.779
just listening that's all and hey there

1604.2 --> 1611.3400000000001
are issues there are some issues going

1606.779 --> 1613.889
on and it's not definitive that it is

1611.34 --> 1617.1299999999999
ready but I just have a natural

1613.889 --> 1618.029
suspicion towards him because of what

1617.13 --> 1621.3600000000001
happened

1618.029 --> 1623.1
past is this just and there's more you

1621.36 --> 1632.7299999999998
know there's also with the drone issue

1623.1 --> 1634.74
and all that and that's it I I'm not

1632.73 --> 1637.5
really interested in like hearing out

1634.74 --> 1639.69
elaborate stories from ranty as to what

1637.5 --> 1641.58
he thinks the situation is I'd rather

1639.69 --> 1644.13
just look at it from a distance I'm not

1641.58 --> 1646.1999999999998
even into all these explanation I'm not

1644.13 --> 1652.169
into this conspiracy but I know it's

1646.2 --> 1658.1100000000001
going on and I kind of keep tabs and

1652.169 --> 1664.22
that's it can't speak truth what are you

1658.11 --> 1664.2199999999998
talking about hypocrite hello

1673.57 --> 1680.9399999999998
okay yeah good servant speak truth here

1676.45 --> 1680.94
asks if you and couldn't block him I

1681.659 --> 1689.7990000000002
but yeah that you better please back up

1686.409 --> 1692.759
that statement there speak truth or I'm

1689.799 --> 1692.759
gonna block you too

1717.7 --> 1723.7
well Cleary I don't think so you know

1723.94 --> 1730.43
like the French sir ranty really broke

1728.48 --> 1737.35
the friend circle okay

1730.43 --> 1737.3500000000001
that's it's not a joke and it's even a

1738.34 --> 1746.9599999999998
Tony really liked Randy and he's like

1743.54 --> 1749.18
hurt about this [ __ ] no because he

1746.96 --> 1750.77
really wants to believe that Randy deep

1749.18 --> 1754.73
inside is a good guy and we'll come back

1750.77 --> 1757.57
to him it's is it it's almost tragic but

1754.73 --> 1761.03
I tried to tell him like dude it's not

1757.57 --> 1765.6799999999998
it's not gonna work you gotta you gotta

1761.03 --> 1767.26
kind of let it go but yeah he feels like

1765.68 --> 1769.28
he's lost a friend in a way it's

1767.26 --> 1774.77
shouldn't even talk about this sorry

1769.28 --> 1789.1399999999999
guys this is not a nice situation here

1774.77 --> 1791.72
a lot of a lot has happening oh really

1789.14 --> 1797.38
oh you think oh and you call that a good

1791.72 --> 1797.38
reason to call Roxana hypocrite

1800.47 --> 1811.24
what the hell what are you serious

1806.32 --> 1811.24
now I don't delete don't do that

1816.26 --> 1826.34
good servant I was in the middle of

1819.95 --> 1833.269
freaking I was gonna read that this is

1826.34 --> 1835.639
not Big Bear chat okay now if it's a

1833.269 --> 1839.2
blatant troll [ __ ] but if I'm like

1835.639 --> 1845.1789999999999
engaging then leave it to me

1839.2 --> 1848.059
all right so yeah the guy said Roxanne

1845.179 --> 1850.5800000000002
says taxes are a fraud and is against

1848.059 --> 1852.62
the government and mainstream media yet

1850.58 --> 1854.09
she is happy to take benefits from the

1852.62 --> 1857.1789999999999
government and says she was going to

1854.09 --> 1863.4189999999999
report it a hospital to the mainstream

1857.179 --> 1866.1490000000001
media hypocritical why why there's

1863.419 --> 1870.5590000000002
nothing wrong with the way what he just

1866.149 --> 1873.62
described because taxes are a fraud a

1870.559 --> 1877.4289999999999
lot of it a lot of it is completely

1873.62 --> 1881.539
ridiculous how it kind of works you know

1877.429 --> 1884.69
the only reason why people kind of let

1881.539 --> 1886.309
it all happen is because society's kind

1884.69 --> 1888.5800000000002
of kept together that's the really

1886.309 --> 1895.85
reason so yeah taxes are very

1888.58 --> 1898.4289999999999
nonsensical and abused and against the

1895.85 --> 1900.11
government is only common sense really

1898.429 --> 1901.7
you've got always got to be careful when

1900.11 --> 1905.019
you deal with the government and the

1901.7 --> 1909.47
mainstream media are you serious come on

1905.019 --> 1912.6490000000001
it's like if you think I'm not even

1909.47 --> 1914.33
gonna try to elaborate on that right and

1912.649 --> 1916.279
taking benefits from the government well

1914.33 --> 1918.4089999999999
what do you think she she tried to get a

1916.279 --> 1922.51
job and then the Coronas [ __ ] happened

1918.409 --> 1926.6000000000001
right and then she lost it again so yeah

1922.51 --> 1930.519
what she's just gonna live on the street

1926.6 --> 1930.519
with her kids are you nuts

1933.86 --> 1941.49
yeah you gotta survive right and as for

1939.269 --> 1946.6200000000001
reporting things to mainstream media hey

1941.49 --> 1951.659
that's that's called like just using the

1946.62 --> 1953.58
situation you know it's it's an attempt

1951.659 --> 1956.1290000000001
to report something I don't know

1953.58 --> 1957.72
reporting a hospital situations to the

1956.129 --> 1959.4599999999998
mainstream media it's probably not

1957.72 --> 1961.2
effective because they have such a

1959.46 --> 1966.72
strict narrative you're not gonna get

1961.2 --> 1969.48
through but who knows it's not a bad

1966.72 --> 1973.3500000000001
idea it's like in a way like Mark

1969.48 --> 1975.1490000000001
sardian has is trying to launch himself

1973.35 --> 1977.639
into the mainstream media and he no

1975.149 --> 1979.9189999999999
knows that with that is kind of like a

1977.639 --> 1983.279
forced ridicule that has to be there on

1979.919 --> 1986.19
to him in order to obtain of maintain

1983.279 --> 1988.08
the mainstream media spell as it were

1986.19 --> 1992.8500000000001
otherwise they're not just gonna loud

1988.08 --> 1996.389
but he knows that and that's not

1992.85 --> 1999.12
hypocritical either it's just making a

1996.389 --> 2001.309
choice and visibility is one of those

1999.12 --> 2006.2299999999998
choices when it comes with Mark Sarge

2001.309 --> 2008.24
oh it's just a way to do things doesn't

2006.23 --> 2010.279
mean that you're gonna agree with that

2008.24 --> 2014.48
platform or gonna oh like oh yeah I

2010.279 --> 2017.09
appeared on this television thing now I

2014.48 --> 2019.73
am a fan of that because I appeared on

2017.09 --> 2021.1689999999999
that television thing really I don't

2019.73 --> 2023.299
know for a lot of people I guess that

2021.169 --> 2026.7990000000002
would work that way that doesn't work

2023.299 --> 2026.799
for for me at least

2032.18 --> 2040.01
right and ya div concept any publicity

2035.4 --> 2040.01
is good publicity and that's it it's

2040.46 --> 2046.32
it's a model it's not flawless though

2043.44 --> 2050.79
there are some downsides on a long run

2046.32 --> 2064.16
especially but yeah when it comes to

2050.79 --> 2072.36
quick feasibility it is true right

2064.16 --> 2074.04
was it Cleary I didn't see it I've

2072.36 --> 2075.83
watched some of it at YouTube but I'm

2074.04 --> 2080.22
still blocked over there it's just I

2075.83 --> 2080.73
don't know I don't like it if I can't

2080.22 --> 2084.77
comment

2080.73 --> 2087.69
that's a what's new well it's not like I

2084.77 --> 2089.94
am offensive or anything and I'm not

2087.69 --> 2093.05
gonna get another account I don't do

2089.94 --> 2093.05
that like ever

2095.66 --> 2100.56
alright yeah there was a protest going

2098.73 --> 2103.29
on you guys now remember yeah that's

2100.56 --> 2107.46
right did it get intense

2103.29 --> 2109.79
I really wasn't in the mood for watching

2107.46 --> 2113.85
a protest too much

2109.79 --> 2119.09
you will good servant okay get a secret

2113.85 --> 2119.0899999999997
no no I don't do that

2129.42 --> 2137.7000000000003
okay speak truth you need to tone it

2131.549 --> 2140.0389999999998
down now instead of diverting in your

2137.7 --> 2142.319
response to good servant action which I

2140.039 --> 2147.21
already addressed so that's none of your

2142.319 --> 2150.859
business at this point right you didn't

2147.21 --> 2154.0190000000002
really give a rebuttal to everything I

2150.859 --> 2156.75
might an analysis of what you said there

2154.019 --> 2162.18
speak truth so could you please continue

2156.75 --> 2164.039
with that or because this I don't know

2162.18 --> 2166.64
how these tactics they feel kind of

2164.039 --> 2166.6400000000003
familiar

2168.559 --> 2173.25
well you're not timed out now you're

2170.88 --> 2176.01
right here right now so I gave you an

2173.25 --> 2178.97
elaborate response and I'd like to

2176.01 --> 2178.9700000000003
response back now

[Music]

2213.43 --> 2223.2599999999998
yeah Cleary I do but I don't want to do

2216.22 --> 2230.73
that no if he doesn't care to unblock me

2223.26 --> 2233.0800000000004
even though I have asked then yeah nope

2230.73 --> 2235.69
apparently he doesn't like me anymore or

2233.08 --> 2241.0299999999997
something you know or it doesn't care

2235.69 --> 2242.98
enough to take it out it's not hard to

2241.03 --> 2246.19
find you know it's just my name that's

2242.98 --> 2247.87
it one word it's probably gonna be

2246.19 --> 2251.32
somewhere at the top of the list because

2247.87 --> 2252.7599999999998
it starts with an A it'd be even though

2251.32 --> 2259.75
it doesn't by the way doesn't work like

2252.76 --> 2261.3100000000004
that and you too but whatever if he

2259.75 --> 2268.33
doesn't care enough then I don't care

2261.31 --> 2270.7799999999997
enough there's plenty of places for me

2268.33 --> 2270.7799999999997
to hang around

2281.97 --> 2288.85
okay that's it now you're getting in

2286.3 --> 2291.69
timeout for me next time you start

2288.85 --> 2294.64
bringing that [ __ ] up you're banned

2291.69 --> 2295.39
because you didn't give an answer to

2294.64 --> 2297.8199999999997
what I said

2295.39 --> 2300.46
you're just diverting the conversation

2297.82 --> 2303.84
on infighting and you haven't really

2300.46 --> 2307.93
accounted properly for your hypocrite

2303.84 --> 2312.52
accusation of Roxanne and yeah I don't

2307.93 --> 2315.64
like what you're doing so if you keep

2312.52 --> 2322.03
this up yeah you're gonna be permanently

2315.64 --> 2323.0099999999998
bad it's Sean Hawkins what are you

2322.03 --> 2326.61
serious

2323.01 --> 2326.61

2336.57 --> 2349.6800000000003
I think I think we have some shitty

2340.35 --> 2351.7799999999997
trolls but I think we got some some

2349.68 --> 2357.75
creepers that like to hang around in

2351.78 --> 2359.7000000000003
dark places and that like people that

2357.75 --> 2362.97
are shady on the internet they like it

2359.7 --> 2366.2999999999997
they don't like when people go against

2362.97 --> 2370.0099999999998
that and stay strong give a good example

2366.3 --> 2370.01
and how to actually deal with it

2374.49 --> 2380.02
the same pull his argument well that

2377.53 --> 2382.9900000000002
could be anyone though you know there's

2380.02 --> 2386.05
Sean Hawkins does typically keep on copy

2382.99 --> 2389.97
pasting that nonsense like it's wrong

2386.05 --> 2389.9700000000003
but he's not the only one

2400.69 --> 2404.579

2451.41 --> 2459.99

2563.42 --> 2581.03
going in my jet you know unfortunately I

2573.16 --> 2593.8399999999997
yeah Eddie's and just trying to chill

2581.03 --> 2597.2000000000003
out what's plenty of late I almost feel

2593.84 --> 2598.88
like just getting another coffee maybe

2597.2 --> 2604.7599999999998
should just do that in the middle of the

2598.88 --> 2607.46
show just to snap out of this because

2604.76 --> 2611.69
this Aldous ranty stuff is just bogging

2607.46 --> 2614.15
me down I don't like you know that all

2611.69 --> 2620.17
these factoids all these things yeah I

2614.15 --> 2626.02
get it but come on it is this it is this

2620.17 --> 2626.02
what we do now on the Internet

2630.54 --> 2640.0099999999998
yeah 101 rockhound really can it have

2634.41 --> 2640.0099999999998
banned more guns goody and that sucks

2644.2 --> 2648.819
yeah speak truth because I was I've

2647.26 --> 2650.53
timed you out because I was in the

2648.819 --> 2654.089
middle of a conversation with you and

2650.53 --> 2657.9100000000003
you kept on addressing good servant

2654.089 --> 2660.7599999999998
while I was literally live here on air

2657.91 --> 2661.21
any conversation with you for a good

2660.76 --> 2665.26
reason

2661.21 --> 2669.01
and under threat of penalty yeah as I

2665.26 --> 2673.7200000000003
said because you accuse somebody that I

2669.01 --> 2676.119
like of hypocrisy and then I rebuttals

2673.72 --> 2679.72
to your accusations basically and

2676.119 --> 2682.78
explained and then use didn't respond to

2679.72 --> 2686.8289999999997
that when I demanded that that's the

2682.78 --> 2696.88
reason I timed you out I warned you so

2686.829 --> 2700.0
could you please do that now I got this

2696.88 --> 2702.9700000000003
like a special little pouch of special

2700.0 --> 2706.0
coffee but that stuff is like dangerous

2702.97 --> 2711.16
man it has like three times the caffeine

2706.0 --> 2720.46
in it it was like yeah this new special

2711.16 --> 2723.42
blend thing that was kind of unusual no

2720.46 --> 2723.42
you didn't respond

2726.25 --> 2734.19
now you just said hypocrisy and then as

2730.17 --> 2734.19
you didn't respond at all

2744.54 --> 2747.739
[Music]

2754.63 --> 2761.17
right yeah I know what a hypocrite means

2757.779 --> 2762.789
speak truth and yeah what you described

2761.17 --> 2765.88
over there someone who says they have a

2762.789 --> 2767.259
particular moral belief but behave in a

2765.88 --> 2772.869
way that shows they are not sincere

2767.259 --> 2776.319
right yeah well I know that that's why I

2772.869 --> 2777.1800000000003
get went through what you said piece by

2776.319 --> 2781.93
piece

2777.18 --> 2784.8999999999996
to show everyone that it's not hypocrite

2781.93 --> 2790.239
it's ridiculous to claim that in this

2784.9 --> 2792.849
circumstance so yeah I basically have

2790.239 --> 2795.009
the same stance I am technically against

2792.849 --> 2797.739
government but that doesn't mean that

2795.009 --> 2800.259
I'm like oh yeah just topple it all just

2797.739 --> 2801.88
like that no no no no it's just that I'm

2800.259 --> 2804.66
against big government I'm against

2801.88 --> 2808.69
bureaucracy I'm against these

2804.66 --> 2811.989
politicians that just Nestle in there

2808.69 --> 2814.329
like a tick and just only do [ __ ] to

2811.989 --> 2818.559
keep keep power and not really fix

2814.329 --> 2821.1090000000004
things that's government that I'm

2818.559 --> 2825.8190000000004
against right and it's a widespread

2821.109 --> 2830.619
problem in the Western world so but I do

2825.819 --> 2833.469
take social welfare as well okay does

2830.619 --> 2836.71
that make me a hypocrite no because I

2833.469 --> 2838.809
think there is some viability to doing

2836.71 --> 2841.39
that you know because if you don't

2838.809 --> 2847.3900000000003
people tend to either die or go into

2841.39 --> 2850.1189999999997
crime when things get rough it's it's

2847.39 --> 2851.68
just a method of approach and just

2850.119 --> 2855.369
because you take social welfare it

2851.68 --> 2857.469
doesn't mean you don't have the right to

2855.369 --> 2860.13
speak your mind anymore that's

2857.469 --> 2860.13
ridiculous

2864.94 --> 2869.86
yeah yeah and I addressed that as well

2867.49 --> 2871.87
mainstream are untrustworthy but that

2869.86 --> 2877.15
doesn't mean that you can't use their

2871.87 --> 2879.1
platform as the saying goes from mark

2877.15 --> 2883.77
Sargeant pretty much brought that to the

2879.1 --> 2889.6
table any attention is good attention

2883.77 --> 2893.79
even if it is by shitty people on a bad

2889.6 --> 2893.79
platform it's about the visibility

2899.78 --> 2907.01
yeah that's right yeah that's right you

2904.52 --> 2910.64
say yeah don't go on that don't watch

2907.01 --> 2914.3
that it's bad but guess what there's

2910.64 --> 2917.15
gonna be people that are watching it and

2914.3 --> 2920.9300000000003
those people that are watching it can

2917.15 --> 2923.0
then see that person and maybe be

2920.93 --> 2925.5499999999997
interested then go to word Channel

2923.0 --> 2927.62
somehow and figure out like hey you

2925.55 --> 2930.6400000000003
shouldn't watch that [ __ ] that you

2927.62 --> 2934.94
spotted me at and then they'd be like

2930.64 --> 2937.52
hmm okay yeah it is kind of like really

2934.94 --> 2940.28
fear party and everything maybe has a

2937.52 --> 2945.88
point so what is the hypocrisy about

2940.28 --> 2945.88
this you seem to have a kind of broken

2946.21 --> 2954.56
conceptualization of what hypocrisy

2948.5 --> 2958.0
really is maybe you just have problems

2954.56 --> 2958.0
with grip on reality here

2962.74 --> 2974.68
right so can you please get to the point

2970.03 --> 2976.71
now and basically admit that Roxanne is

2974.68 --> 2979.75
not being a hypocrite

2976.71 --> 2985.0
with the accusations you loo you lay

2979.75 --> 2987.69
down I appreciated that if you would do

2985.0 --> 2987.69
that right now

2997.54 --> 3000.67
[Music]

3020.31 --> 3026.33
that's interesting Roger MC maybe

3029.37 --> 3039.96
it well but yeah is it even possible to

3037.11 --> 3042.33
have just a quick account like make a

3039.96 --> 3044.73
sock account and then use that to donate

3042.33 --> 3048.2599999999998
a huge amount of money because then

3044.73 --> 3048.26
maybe you're right

3054.64 --> 3057.5099999999998
I don't know

3059.2 --> 3065.77
see that that is why I keep people like

3062.29 --> 3068.71
Roger MC unblocked even though he can be

3065.77 --> 3071.23
quite annoying at times but he knows how

3068.71 --> 3074.049
to behave well enough to not get banned

3071.23 --> 3077.19
here and sometimes he brings up

3074.049 --> 3077.19
interesting points

3082.67 --> 3086.3
[Music]

3098.8 --> 3107.4700000000003
all right so I guess speak truth that

3102.79 --> 3109.96
it's wisely shutting up or well it's not

3107.47 --> 3111.97
really wise because that means if he's

3109.96 --> 3115.66
not gonna just admit that he was wrong

3111.97 --> 3119.73
with this media accusation of hypocrisy

3115.66 --> 3124.1499999999996
towards Roxanne with his examples then

3119.73 --> 3128.68
yeah not doing that is probably also

3124.15 --> 3134.82
gonna make me ban you cuz yeah you still

3128.68 --> 3134.8199999999997
put that out there and don't like that

3155.85 --> 3160.5299999999997
right okay well there he goes

3172.42 --> 3182.569
yeah because yeah if you're gonna call

3179.869 --> 3185.809
yourself speak truth and then literally

3182.569 --> 3190.04
call somebody hypocrite and they're not

3185.809 --> 3195.73
actually backing up that thing that kind

3190.04 --> 3201.579
of makes you a hypocrite like very

3195.73 --> 3201.579
blatantly so yeah

3219.78 --> 3224.28
hmm

3221.19 --> 3228.059
right well Missouri bear the whole

3224.28 --> 3233.539
lottery thing yeah but it's because of

3228.059 --> 3233.539
the the scale of possibilities

3233.93 --> 3239.73
not everybody is super talented in

3236.91 --> 3244.02
knowing how to deal with huge amounts of

3239.73 --> 3245.94
money and besides if somebody suddenly

3244.02 --> 3249.329
gets a lot of money that catches

3245.94 --> 3252.03
attention like yeah

3249.329 --> 3254.94
vultures people that immediately try to

3252.03 --> 3258.6800000000003
yeah I get you to buy into deals and

3254.94 --> 3258.68
[ __ ] like it's terrible

3271.89 --> 3276.15
yeah yet they don't lose all their money

3274.349 --> 3278.4
because of the love of money they just

3276.15 --> 3281.4500000000003
lose all their money and go broke in a

3278.4 --> 3284.4500000000003

3484.09 --> 3487.23
any truth to these guys

3488.66 --> 3491.8799999999997
[Music]

3515.32 --> 3521.4100000000003
I'm asking the the people that are very

3518.83 --> 3525.18
familiar with the Bible is what he says

3521.41 --> 3530.35
true is it always in caps in full caps I

3525.18 --> 3532.2999999999997
highly doubt it because I think then

3530.35 --> 3535.5099999999998
you're going into more of like free

3532.3 --> 3542.04
Masonic weird issues with that they use

3535.51 --> 3542.0400000000004
all caps and like state legal

3569.79 --> 3572.79
hmm

3575.27 --> 3581.81
now that's odd secret Asian man if that

3579.35 --> 3585.3689999999997
is really true then that that is kind of

3581.81 --> 3589.96
suspicious that that's a that look these

3585.369 --> 3594.44
details mean huge have huge implications

3589.96 --> 3600.11
literally all caps that that's usually a

3594.44 --> 3602.21
sign that for me that's a sign that it

3600.11 --> 3606.26
is kind of like the opposite of what you

3602.21 --> 3608.96
would think it is it's kind of an in or

3606.26 --> 3611.84
that it's in that direction something

3608.96 --> 3614.29
else so what you on the surface might

3611.84 --> 3614.29
expect

3623.789 --> 3626.2690000000002
right

3630.75 --> 3646.67
they were they replaced ja way with

3633.72 --> 3646.6699999999996
Laura - right okay mm-hmm no we didn't

3646.76 --> 3660.8
okay well AI losing track I just changed

3656.25 --> 3660.8
the spelling okay if you say so

3669.49 --> 3676.6299999999997
and so did they change it as in the

3673.0 --> 3678.73
newer prints have changed that or is

3676.63 --> 3682.78
this some weird Mandela effect that now

3678.73 --> 3686.1
everything is caps Lord like the this is

3682.78 --> 3686.1000000000004
the first time I'm hearing or that

3696.089 --> 3702.089
yeah guess what yes is that in the new

3700.799 --> 3706.41
print or is it

3702.089 --> 3709.729
mandala affect issue I don't know that

3706.41 --> 3717.239
maybe I just pull that out of nowhere

3709.729 --> 3726.509
but do you never know these days so

3717.239 --> 3729.7690000000002
which is it all right so that's like an

3726.509 --> 3729.7690000000002
official update thing

3754.58 --> 3765.29
different grammatical meaning alright

3757.85 --> 3770.95
okay well oh dear I think this is more

3765.29 --> 3774.17
up Bible literalists she probably has a

3770.95 --> 3776.39
much more wild she has an oversight over

3774.17 --> 3782.03
these things I don't like these type of

3776.39 --> 3783.95
technicals she know I mainly just try to

3782.03 --> 3787.25
focus on the frequency in the path of

3783.95 --> 3789.56
Christ and my personal life because that

3787.25 --> 3793.9
is really the overarching lesson that

3789.56 --> 3793.9
I've had to learn all my life is not to

3795.04 --> 3803.69
adapt to things outside but try to adapt

3798.89 --> 3809.7799999999997
to things inside and so it's like I have

3803.69 --> 3813.17
to write my own virtual Bible of me kind

3809.78 --> 3815.119
of it's interesting because if an Owen

3813.17 --> 3818.2400000000002
Benjamin talked about this to yesterday

3815.119 --> 3820.55
I think that every religion really is

3818.24 --> 3822.859
personal and you're going to be bound to

3820.55 --> 3826.4
have different you're gonna bound to be

3822.859 --> 3829.46
having disagreements like it should be

3826.4 --> 3834.01
like that because it is personal and so

3829.46 --> 3837.9700000000003
that is what I'm focusing on on me my

3834.01 --> 3837.9700000000003
what I should be doing

3838.3 --> 3842.9300000000003
according to creation and according to

3841.1 --> 3846.23
everything I've experienced and what I

3842.93 --> 3849.0499999999997
see out there in the world and and then

3846.23 --> 3852.29
try to build that and then keep make

3849.05 --> 3857.0800000000004
that resonate and then hope it'll be the

3852.29 --> 3860.0
right thing but also trust that it will

3857.08 --> 3864.3199999999997
it's like that is my surrender to God

3860.0 --> 3865.46
like I have to do that and I don't know

3864.32 --> 3868.52
where it leads

3865.46 --> 3872.69
it might lead to two glorious things or

3868.52 --> 3876.38
it may lead to like yeah a gruesome end

3872.69 --> 3880.4900000000002
really that's partly in my head too but

3876.38 --> 3883.67
yeah that could be trickery there's oh

3880.49 --> 3886.7099999999996
man i I've had some more like

3883.67 --> 3889.88
realization of like very

3886.71 --> 3896.2200000000003
painful visions and then just suddenly

3889.88 --> 3898.6400000000003
realizing what it was a metaphor for for

3896.22 --> 3903.8999999999996
another situation that it went through

3898.64 --> 3906.2999999999997
that was the real world but the weird

3903.9 --> 3908.94
thing was is that when I was younger I

3906.3 --> 3912.65
could be much more heavily hurt by

3908.94 --> 3916.41
things like I was extremely sensitive

3912.65 --> 3919.5
but I did not have the character to

3916.41 --> 3924.5989999999997
really build it up so things would just

3919.5 --> 3927.9
like unnecessarily hurt me in a personal

3924.599 --> 3931.8
way it's crazy and I think that is part

3927.9 --> 3936.06
of why I've seen so many yeah just

3931.8 --> 3938.88
really painful torturous psychologically

3936.06 --> 3944.88
torturous dark world issues because I

3938.88 --> 3947.67
think that is like a like reflection to

3944.88 --> 3951.4700000000003
deal with just relative normal

3947.67 --> 3957.05
situations where I would just hurt

3951.47 --> 3960.72
irrationally much about it stupid yeah

3957.05 --> 3964.05
it's tough to explain so but I figure be

3960.72 --> 3966.93
figuring out like whoa there's more

3964.05 --> 3969.78
direct tie-ins even with the faces and

3966.93 --> 3974.0299999999997
everything and just like holy [ __ ]

3969.78 --> 3977.13
that's like a like an a hallucination

3974.03 --> 3979.7000000000003
reflection in a dream but it's like

3977.13 --> 3985.13
perfectly synchronous it's perfectly

3979.7 --> 3989.0989999999997
symmetrical in its translation it's and

3985.13 --> 3992.07
yeah in my memory it's like all kinds of

3989.099 --> 3998.0
these type of things are just like a

3992.07 --> 3998.0
crazy nonsensical dark story

4000.94 --> 4012.05
pretty bizarre but also a relief because

4007.09 --> 4014.84
yes some of those things when taken

4012.05 --> 4024.13
little worried I would haunt the best of

4014.84 --> 4027.4300000000003
people but yeah I probably also did

4024.13 --> 4036.31
witness some really [ __ ] up [ __ ] in

4027.43 --> 4036.31
the real world but much more sparingly

4050.4 --> 4053.15
all right

4060.4 --> 4066.65
the thing is why I even brought it up

4063.37 --> 4069.5899999999997
it's really personal okay actually it's

4066.65 --> 4072.56
kind of odd that I even chose to put it

4069.59 --> 4080.15
out there like this but it happened

4072.56 --> 4082.31
better I just better work on it but the

4080.15 --> 4084.59
weird thing is that I think I used to

4082.31 --> 4093.89
have a perfect control over the dark

4084.59 --> 4097.400000000001
world and I would also be aware of that

4093.89 --> 4099.62
it is like a fantasy reflection response

4097.4 --> 4103.25
and that there's things you can get out

4099.62 --> 4110.12
of it and that the acts and the meanings

4103.25 --> 4112.82
of like did it's more symbolic and I

4110.12 --> 4116.54
used to have like a perfect control over

4112.82 --> 4119.2699999999995
this and then freaking Jesuit guy happen

4116.54 --> 4126.56
and then I got meddled with and I kind

4119.27 --> 4130.870000000001
of lost the understanding that that

4126.56 --> 4136.22
allowed me to control that situation and

4130.87 --> 4139.5199999999995
maybe it's slowly coming back to me so

4136.22 --> 4141.92
that I can just forget all these like

4139.52 --> 4145.67
these yeah if you don't have the grip

4141.92 --> 4148.91
over that thing then it becomes like

4145.67 --> 4151.91
haunting nightmares to you if you don't

4148.91 --> 4154.94
if you don't really deep inside realize

4151.91 --> 4159.139999999999
what they are and just cannot beat this

4154.94 --> 4160.82
they cannot be dissuaded that it might

4159.14 --> 4163.93
be something else because I was

4160.82 --> 4167.469999999999
dissuaded that it was something else and

4163.93 --> 4170.650000000001
that's really what caused so much chaos

4167.47 --> 4170.650000000001
for me

4173.56 --> 4184.009
but I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna restore it

4177.23 --> 4188.178999999999
I am restoring it I'm restoring it

4184.009 --> 4190.96
openly and with that comes a challenge

4188.179 --> 4194.389
like oh really you you want to try to

4190.96 --> 4199.369
distort it [ __ ] with my mind again like

4194.389 --> 4203.2300000000005
that no that's no this time I'm gonna

4199.369 --> 4207.71
take it all on there's no there's no

4203.23 --> 4212.83
psychological barrier really for me left

4207.71 --> 4212.83
now now that I've been through all this

4217.0 --> 4224.449
I'd have had these this heavy heavy

4220.9 --> 4229.25
psychological test on me I feel

4224.449 --> 4232.4
unbreakable like that and effectively I

4229.25 --> 4236.929
haven't broken in a long time now and

4232.4 --> 4240.23
like less and less like effectively

4236.929 --> 4242.4490000000005
breaking but even in the swings that I

4240.23 --> 4244.669999999999
still they'll still do experience I

4242.449 --> 4247.4
don't even get to the breaking point

4244.67 --> 4254.4800000000005
anymore I've got it under control that

4247.4 --> 4256.909
much despite all the yeah situation like

4254.48 --> 4259.61
financially and just my way of going

4256.909 --> 4263.57
about hasn't really changed that much it

4259.61 --> 4267.489
has changed is this project doing this

4263.57 --> 4271.159
with you people and me going out

4267.489 --> 4272.69
watching things thinking about it see

4271.159 --> 4275.2699999999995
where people are going and then

4272.69 --> 4277.04
reporting on it as part of the show it's

4275.27 --> 4279.830000000001
part of what I do and being part of the

4277.04 --> 4282.31
Flat Earth debates of course and working

4279.83 --> 4282.3099999999995
on those things

4289.93 --> 4292.999000000001
[Music]

4294.48 --> 4300.49
dude jeffrey bill you've you've

4297.07 --> 4304.509999999999
contracted a squirt fetish have you I

4300.49 --> 4308.8
mean the word squirt I kind of had it do

4304.51 --> 4311.5
for for a few days but then I realized

4308.8 --> 4314.77
if you talk about squirt all the time

4311.5 --> 4318.22
then you become squirt don't talk about

4314.77 --> 4322.27
squirt too much unless you're Big Bear

4318.22 --> 4325.360000000001
and it's the right moment that it just

4322.27 --> 4328.31
kidding man I there's been some

4325.36 --> 4331.419
squirters here in the chat earlier

4328.31 --> 4331.419000000001
[Music]

4337.979 --> 4341.579000000001
okay a gem

4346.63 --> 4351.96
okay I just come back okay it's fine

4355.9 --> 4360.58
all right but just a warning if every

4358.719 --> 4365.38
sentence you put out there has the word

4360.58 --> 4373.03
squirt in it then you risk becoming a

4365.38 --> 4383.92
square that's kind of a joke but

4373.03 --> 4386.219
seriously watch it where's everybody

4383.92 --> 4386.219
alone

4438.59 --> 4444.2
it's so interesting good servant thank

4442.59 --> 4447.42
you for yeah

4444.2 --> 4449.88
we but I'm gonna be weird for a little

4447.42 --> 4455.52
moment and what you just said is from

4449.88 --> 4459.9890000000005
the Bible right but I certainly saw it

4455.52 --> 4463.71
from a different way as usual I saw it

4459.989 --> 4467.339999999999
from a frequency perspective and then

4463.71 --> 4472.08
realized that what it said there is like

4467.34 --> 4475.05
a metaphor also that is interesting

4472.08 --> 4478.32
because it is about like become the

4475.05 --> 4481.92
effective conversion from the darkness

4478.32 --> 4485.3099999999995
that if thou shalt confess with thy

4481.92 --> 4489.12
mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe

4485.31 --> 4492.2390000000005
in thine heart that God hath raised him

4489.12 --> 4495.69
from the dead thou shalt be safe so that

4492.239 --> 4500.54
is a very typical almost like a sayin

4495.69 --> 4504.96
thing right but it is old exit earrings

4500.54 --> 4509.61
because if you read that in a different

4504.96 --> 4514.8
type of way and that is like if you

4509.61 --> 4518.599999999999
confess your mistake with with your

4514.8 --> 4522.150000000001
mouth if you speak the truth like

4518.6 --> 4524.700000000001
confess to the Lord that's like speak

4522.15 --> 4532.2
the truth it's like connect speak the

4524.7 --> 4534.929999999999
truth then in your heart you God has

4532.2 --> 4538.91
raised hidden Christ the truth in your

4534.93 --> 4545.820000000001
heart could be raised from the death

4538.91 --> 4548.87
yeah you will be saved from being

4545.82 --> 4548.87
dragged down I

4551.469 --> 4562.2300000000005
is it just me or does that really

4554.65 --> 4562.23
describe how the personal process works

4563.73 --> 4575.29
maybe it's just me maybe I'm being a bit

4568.51 --> 4578.46
of a gnostic or whatever about this but

4575.29 --> 4578.46
I see that in there

4580.18 --> 4584.799
[Music]

4606.9 --> 4612.0199999999995
all right Jeffrey Bell that's right yep

4612.89 --> 4616.71
yeah but the wrench is all about the

4615.3 --> 4618.900000000001
discipline though you know there are

4616.71 --> 4621.9
still schools quarters are technically

4618.9 --> 4624.96
allowed in chat as long as they have a

4621.9 --> 4627.719999999999
point or want to try to make a point

4624.96 --> 4631.32
it's just you know the wrenches really

4627.72 --> 4634.62
are for the people that are are there to

4631.32 --> 4636.57
really try to destroy the show that

4634.62 --> 4639.2699999999995
they're really spamming or disgusting

4636.57 --> 4641.28
[ __ ] then it's like click just like that

4639.27 --> 4643.05
if it's blatantly obvious that they're

4641.28 --> 4645.12
trying now if you're reading into

4643.05 --> 4647.04
something that has already been kind of

4645.12 --> 4649.22
in a conversation maybe they may be a

4647.04 --> 4652.05
little bit triggered or something and

4649.22 --> 4654.18
then they might use a couple of slightly

4652.05 --> 4657.66
dirty words then that's not directly

4654.18 --> 4660.41
just instant timeout or ban because then

4657.66 --> 4663.93
that is a genuine person may be using

4660.41 --> 4668.46
yeah going a little bit far right that's

4663.93 --> 4671.04
different so I don't know it's it's yeah

4668.46 --> 4674.37
using a wrench in my chat is it's kind

4671.04 --> 4677.88
of difficult but especially if there is

4674.37 --> 4680.13
just a conversation going that's not

4677.88 --> 4684.72
being super politicized or polarized

4680.13 --> 4691.74
then then I appreciate it if you don't

4684.72 --> 4695.75
ban them or time them out reporting for

4691.74 --> 4697.8
duty this is a bit of heaven right

4695.75 --> 4700.43
squirters can be entertaining to watch

4697.8 --> 4708.3
them self-destruct yeah that that too

4700.43 --> 4711.450000000001
that too you know when when a squirter

4708.3 --> 4716.1
is detected in chat when it is a proper

4711.45 --> 4719.429999999999
squirter they have like this pattern of

4716.1 --> 4721.77
their squirt and it's always almost to

4719.43 --> 4724.17
me like wow if it's like a real squirter

4721.77 --> 4726.09
then you can time them out right away

4724.17 --> 4728.7300000000005
because it's like no they have to show

4726.09 --> 4730.68
you have to prove to people that they

4728.73 --> 4732.249
are squirters and what that is and how

4730.68 --> 4738.55
typical it is

4732.249 --> 4740.619
no did before you bet now you got to

4738.55 --> 4745.929
show them like yeah this is what a

4740.619 --> 4748.719
squirt or no it's like a biology class

4745.929 --> 4756.369
example almost yeah you got to let it do

4748.719 --> 4763.21
its trick no you don't ever rent you

4756.369 --> 4765.509999999999
jeffrey bill you may get it back but not

4763.21 --> 4765.51
right now

4767.54 --> 4770.659
[Music]

4774.07 --> 4780.639999999999
well Ben efendim I just pretty much gave

4778.15 --> 4783.25
an entirely different interpretation as

4780.64 --> 4786.09
to what that means Jesus being raised

4783.25 --> 4786.09
from the dead right

4786.6 --> 4793.450000000001
they said it it could be interpreted it

4790.69 --> 4796.48
Jesus is the truth the frequency of

4793.45 --> 4798.96
truth and now the esoteric effects that

4796.48 --> 4802.139999999999
come with it raised from the dead

4798.96 --> 4805.21
basically be to return so if somebody's

4802.14 --> 4811.72
completely stuck in lies in the trap and

4805.21 --> 4814.27
all gravel up then Jesus could still be

4811.72 --> 4819.280000000001
raised from the death this truth could

4814.27 --> 4822.070000000001
still fix it and then what good servant

4819.28 --> 4825.15
said earlier can describe exactly how

4822.07 --> 4828.009999999999
that works so it's almost like a

4825.15 --> 4830.879999999999
transformation description to me that's

4828.01 --> 4830.88
how I read it

4841.8 --> 4844.919
[Music]

4845.02 --> 4850.870000000001
Christ consciousness well you could call

4848.08 --> 4853.38
it Christ consciousness it or you could

4850.87 --> 4856.69
call it the natural consequence of

4853.38 --> 4860.77
really dedicating to truth because it is

4856.69 --> 4862.989
a dedication it is literally every part

4860.77 --> 4866.14
of truth is sacrifices there's also

4862.989 --> 4871.69
there's so much you give up but if you

4866.14 --> 4874.3
do then the rewards that are normally

4871.69 --> 4876.3099999999995
just unfathomable ungraspable you can't

4874.3 --> 4879.76
grasp it from the darkness they just

4876.31 --> 4885.150000000001
come and then they change your entire

4879.76 --> 4885.150000000001
way of view the experience

4895.17 --> 4900.15
I don't know about that secret agent man

4897.48 --> 4903.5
that that wasn't the the metaphor that I

4900.15 --> 4903.5
was trying to give

4927.51 --> 4930.320000000001
hmm

4935.53 --> 4946.2
okay okay Jeffrey bill stop it we're not

4942.94 --> 4946.2
talking about squirting

4950.32 --> 4956.38
yeah batch batch scored is kind of like

4953.35 --> 4962.1
squid I talked about that a couple of

4956.38 --> 4968.56
days ago my show the squirting squids

4962.1 --> 4971.89
squirt digital ink in check and it is

4968.56 --> 4974.38
like it's like a squid squirt ink this

4971.89 --> 4977.9800000000005
has the same function it's kinda too in

4974.38 --> 4983.13
it's a defense mechanism squirt to get

4977.98 --> 4983.129999999999
away because it's scary is scary

5010.87 --> 5015.07
no don't that's right

5030.12 --> 5037.41
I don't like the mix of these two

5033.33 --> 5044.43
subjects really they should be there

5037.41 --> 5048.92
together in the same conversation okay

5044.43 --> 5048.92

5060.46 --> 5067.61
okay beta phantom I don't know I haven't

5065.63 --> 5073.79
really noticed the only thing I noticed

5067.61 --> 5077.9
from walk-down is that there's just some

5073.79 --> 5081.62
naughty like loops circus situations

5077.9 --> 5085.66
going on in how you have to go in stores

5081.62 --> 5085.66
