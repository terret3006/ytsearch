6.52 --> 41.59
[Music]

37.23 --> 45.849999999999994
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.59 --> 52.899
early-bird number 106 I'm your host

45.85 --> 55.059
Arwen and today is a beautiful day it's

52.899 --> 61.829
kind of weird it's kind of a trick day

55.059 --> 61.82899999999999
because just look at this this outside

63.89 --> 72.56
look at that isn't that beautiful but oh

68.39 --> 82.369
look at that look at that and then look

72.56 --> 87.56
at this and oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] it's really

82.369 --> 91.31
funny it's like in a way it seems they

87.56 --> 93.679
kept this patch clear it's real it's

91.31 --> 95.96000000000001
like their own let me show again it's

93.679 --> 98.2
like even planes flying over right there

95.96 --> 98.19999999999999
and

101.67 --> 106.62
yeah I apparently see but yeah there's

105.33 --> 109.88
planes flying and they're not really

106.62 --> 112.47
leaving any serious chemtrails but like

109.88 --> 113.39999999999999
on the other side on the other side of

112.47 --> 116.17999999999999
the building

113.4 --> 121.25
like pretty early on there were like big

116.18 --> 126.36000000000001
cross works of chemtrails out there and

121.25 --> 127.97
they're flowing slowly this way probably

126.36 --> 130.259
by the end of the show it's been a

127.97 --> 135.239
beautiful blue patch over there it's

130.259 --> 137.04
gonna be gone but yeah for now it looks

135.239 --> 139.709
really nice and the Sun is just nice and

137.04 --> 145.44
bright out there and birds everywhere

139.709 --> 149.33
and start out bits but yesterday like

145.44 --> 152.97
after the show ended I decided like yeah

149.33 --> 154.739
okay no debates apparently although in

152.97 --> 157.55
retrospect there seemed to have been

154.739 --> 160.11
debates but then I joined in late and

157.55 --> 163.20000000000002
was no room on the panel so I couldn't

160.11 --> 165.57000000000002
really get on but yeah I had this

163.2 --> 168.04899999999998
opportunity and I took it to just get

165.57 --> 168.049
outside

168.65 --> 175.70000000000002
pre-roll a few basic cigarettes and take

172.94 --> 181.269
a great walk outside in that Sun in the

175.7 --> 184.159
beautiful Sun towards a yeah a small

181.269 --> 190.37
patch of some force not really force

184.159 --> 193.64
it's like countryside and I love walking

190.37 --> 196.12900000000002
that little little route it's a little

193.64 --> 199.01
forest walking route and whoa so many

196.129 --> 202.879
people so many people were walking there

199.01 --> 206.14999999999998
and like on the way there's this typical

202.879 --> 210.41
patch or this piece of road right next

206.15 --> 215.44
to the river that's flowing past my my

210.41 --> 220.01
house almost and it's like full of geese

215.44 --> 221.659
just not a few like maybe like a hundred

220.01 --> 225.07899999999998
of them and they're spread all over the

221.659 --> 228.17
place and it's lovely it's really cool

225.079 --> 231.40900000000002
to see so many of them just chilling you

228.17 --> 233.51
needs and doing their geese thing it's

231.409 --> 237.62
funny because geese are pretty

233.51 --> 240.53
territorial and so yeah you can't just

237.62 --> 242.75
walk right past them without expecting

240.53 --> 246.879
one of them to go like oh yeah yeah yeah

242.75 --> 246.879
you disrespecting me and then just

247.48 --> 254.98899999999998
that's what Keys do and it's funny

250.91 --> 257.959
because like the way back there's like

254.989 --> 260.56
this family young bikes mother and a

257.959 --> 264.289
father and a little kid and little kid

260.56 --> 265.97
and they were like yeah stopping at the

264.289 --> 269.449
road and just look like look at those

265.97 --> 273.05
keys and it started to make G sound well

269.449 --> 275.32
yeah the geese were like what what you

273.05 --> 278.479
challenging me bro

275.32 --> 281.24
and the family can didn't get it

278.479 --> 283.34
that yes they were imitating these geese

281.24 --> 286.34000000000003
the geese were like getting really

283.34 --> 290.0
alerted and loud and starting to move as

286.34 --> 292.96999999999997
a group towards them were like you might

290.0 --> 295.94
wanna move on at some point or you're

292.97 --> 298.58000000000004
gonna be loose warmed by geese these

295.94 --> 302.539
people didn't really know

298.58 --> 305.27
didn't really get like how G's work but

302.539 --> 308.18
they were just amused by by the glory of

305.27 --> 310.34
it and being a bit naive and its

308.18 --> 314.12
innocent it's kind of funny

310.34 --> 317.599
but I had this great walk and I saw all

314.12 --> 320.15
kinds of birds amazing like the small

317.599 --> 322.099
ones of course lots of them around

320.15 --> 328.87899999999996
they're really having a good time

322.099 --> 335.24
I also saw buzzards like a couple of

328.879 --> 339.22
them like flying high and just keeping a

335.24 --> 342.319
lookout probably hunting for like small

339.22 --> 344.53900000000004
small rodents or whatever see if they

342.319 --> 347.0
could get something didn't really catch

344.539 --> 350.84
them catching anything but yeah that was

347.0 --> 351.94
cool to see and storks you don't see

350.84 --> 357.229
them too often

351.94 --> 362.599
there were storks and even like had a

357.229 --> 367.159
nest top of a small old castle thing

362.599 --> 370.759
still in use that castle countryside

367.159 --> 372.229
small castle and you can even visit that

370.759 --> 374.36
place apparently I've never been there

372.229 --> 379.25
before inside of it but I bumped into

374.36 --> 381.62
this is very talkative nice lady with

379.25 --> 383.84
dogs and we had like a long talk about

381.62 --> 388.699
all kinds of things about birds about

383.84 --> 391.56899999999996
springtime about yeah so beautiful and I

388.699 --> 394.099
hope they don't go insane and like

391.569 --> 396.199
destroy it all to make more buildings

394.099 --> 398.349
for more people because it'll just ruin

396.199 --> 402.05
the whole value of the entire place

398.349 --> 403.94
because yeah this place these buildings

402.05 --> 405.14
have value because it is beautiful

403.94 --> 408.77
around here

405.14 --> 411.89
so it was really cool oh yeah he even

408.77 --> 415.52
saw Starks mating see that every year

411.89 --> 418.87
every so often that was really good

415.52 --> 418.87
experience loved it

422.08 --> 429.039
so yeah that's that was happening

424.659 --> 432.569
yesterday yeah Daniel field Utrecht

429.039 --> 432.56899999999996
the north part of it

439.26 --> 442.34
yeah that was nice

445.68 --> 451.31
afterward I had pretty much a big bit of

449.07 --> 457.08
a repeat of the day before just

451.31 --> 462.27
listening new music picking up taking it

457.08 --> 465.03
back up them again and just partying but

462.27 --> 467.46
on my own and having great fun having

465.03 --> 472.59
picked out new great songs for my

467.46 --> 476.69899999999996
database like this is like database the

472.59 --> 479.42999999999995
best songs that don't have errors and it

476.699 --> 482.61
or like two creepy suggestions that are

479.43 --> 485.639
just that can't be looked at in the

482.61 --> 487.35
other way I collect them it's very hard

485.639 --> 490.44
to find the really good ones in between

487.35 --> 493.05
the more creepy ones because the other

490.44 --> 495.75
in-between there as well I love that

493.05 --> 500.49
music posted some of it in the Skype

495.75 --> 505.47
chat and let's see

500.49 --> 509.539
yeah then this morning woke up early

505.47 --> 509.53900000000004
again so usually do when a drink wine

510.169 --> 518.4789999999999
oh yeah he got up started watching Owen

514.909 --> 521.659
Benjamin from yesterday let's be like

518.479 --> 525.0500000000001
three hours so I didn't even get to

521.659 --> 528.41
halfway but it was really intense really

525.05 --> 530.42
really intense but a comedian guy that

528.41 --> 533.24
to be fair I don't really know all that

530.42 --> 536.149
well but it was one of Owen Benjamin's

533.24 --> 540.8290000000001
friend and apparently he had supposedly

536.149 --> 546.05
committed suicide and was terrible of

540.829 --> 549.019
course but also yeah just Owen really

546.05 --> 552.1099999999999
got it in a wide way and he explains so

549.019 --> 554.39
much about how people respond to this I

552.11 --> 562.63
have to conceptualize it it's just very

554.39 --> 562.63
very rich very intense human man

563.79 --> 572.8199999999999
yeah I keep on watching him for a good

566.94 --> 578.34
reason it's just so he's so real in his

572.82 --> 586.22
own way it's amazing stuff anyway let's

578.34 --> 594.45
see who was in chat day and Grif Steve

586.22 --> 600.87
Daniel field on the ship Oh can't see a

594.45 --> 606.9000000000001
J M the empty matrix uber McCool peanuts

600.87 --> 610.58
Clarke 101 rock hound that's a Smasher

606.9 --> 613.53
Shadowcat yeah good to see you all so I

610.58 --> 616.59
I'm gonna get a guest on already gave

613.53 --> 619.1999999999999
him the link she I don't know when he's

616.59 --> 622.77
gonna appear it's like a guy it's been

619.2 --> 624.33
on the flatter scene or looking on the

622.77 --> 629.88
flattered scene for a while for like

624.33 --> 631.5600000000001
five years he said from Bulgaria and he

629.88 --> 636.03
has some science background and he had a

631.56 --> 638.78
lot of inputs on what's happening on the

636.03 --> 641.73
Flat Earth debates and the physics of it

638.78 --> 644.31
yeah we had a Skype call like before

641.73 --> 646.1700000000001
this but it was so rich so intense that

644.31 --> 649.5799999999999
it's like oh my god it's almost a waste

646.17 --> 652.53
and not put that live on air cuz pretty

649.58 --> 656.58
pretty good stuff I hope to yeah I hope

652.53 --> 659.03
you'll join soon we can continue this

656.58 --> 659.0300000000001
discussion

672.04 --> 674.8199999999999
mmm

678.63 --> 684.62
look at all these planes flying over but

682.139 --> 689.699
not really leaving any chemtrails it's

684.62 --> 693.63
so ironic how that works sometimes yeah

689.699 --> 696.3
they spray it spray big lines sometimes

693.63 --> 699.98
said they're just flying by and leaving

696.3 --> 699.9799999999999
a comp trail that just evaporates

701.05 --> 708.8199999999999
I really do wonder sometimes if these

704.709 --> 712.18
pilots even know you know what they're

708.82 --> 714.7
doing or if they're just following their

712.18 --> 722.0999999999999
instructions and the spraying is done

714.7 --> 725.08
fully automated so a days young yep oh

722.1 --> 728.89
yeah you're the one also that yeah

725.08 --> 732.4590000000001
dictation gif is that the right

728.89 --> 736.5699999999999
pronunciation it's actually without J

732.459 --> 737.709
it's just a young I don't know if you

736.57 --> 744.0400000000001
can pronounce it though

737.709 --> 746.17
try the just I am Dan yeah yeah that's

744.04 --> 747.3389999999999
right you can go for it dan Daniel world

746.17 --> 750.16
whatever

747.339 --> 756.0600000000001
go whine all right I think it's a cool

750.16 --> 761.38
name actually so it's very East European

756.06 --> 763.42
Slovak yeah yeah like right right so

761.38 --> 766.66
yeah how are you doing man thanks I'm

763.42 --> 770.16
fine just so I was just really ready to

766.66 --> 774.3389999999999
get back from work Joy said you wanna

770.16 --> 776.67
ruin your plans so I hope I made it

774.339 --> 776.6700000000001
quick enough

777.12 --> 782.22
I'm sorry but there's this weird thing

779.709 --> 784.9499999999999
about your camera this seems like it's

782.22 --> 788.11
look like her to Elizabeth

784.95 --> 791.1400000000001
well it's presenting you a bit like a

788.11 --> 797.649
stylized act at Correll painting for

791.14 --> 801.49
some reason I just turned off I don't

797.649 --> 803.68
know it's just the camera oh you know it

801.49 --> 806.8290000000001
looks like a filter - I think it was

803.68 --> 809.14
Lloyd that looks fine but it's just odd

806.829 --> 814.17
yeah yeah I saw myself in the cart one

809.14 --> 820.42
of it fit strange so I don't know is it

814.17 --> 822.579
an issue war I don't know maybe it's

820.42 --> 826.029
part of the camera itself it's just a

822.579 --> 828.9399999999999
standard program it may be running maybe

826.029 --> 834.13
yeah what are you using a standard web

828.94 --> 834.85
cam or no camera sorry it's the laptop

834.13 --> 840.639
camera

834.85 --> 841.4200000000001
right probably nothing yeah I don't know

840.639 --> 847.5600000000001
why that is

841.42 --> 849.7299999999999
I've seen it before but it's just why no

847.56 --> 852.7299999999999
button yeah it's fine it's it's not

849.73 --> 855.339
really that distractive so yeah let's

852.73 --> 857.889
get into the conversation I almost felt

855.339 --> 860.23
a bit guilty because yeah in our Skype

857.889 --> 862.38
call you you brought out such powerful

860.23 --> 868.899
stuff there's like oh my god

862.38 --> 872.319
this should be recorded it wasn't yeah

868.899 --> 876.1
so we'll start all over again just maybe

872.319 --> 878.74
getting a bit more in depth yeah make it

876.1 --> 881.37
a bit slower because we're just talking

878.74 --> 884.5
between us so we don't need that much

881.37 --> 886.2090000000001
you know the time to actually explain to

884.5 --> 888.49
each other what we're talking about this

886.209 --> 892.3889999999999
you don't know right so but probably for

888.49 --> 896.61
your audience to be placing just we go

892.389 --> 899.35
slower and expand upon we talked about

896.61 --> 902.649
just trying to do the same thing just

899.35 --> 906.13
start out by explaining who you are how

902.649 --> 910.899
you came to Flat Earth and what have you

906.13 --> 914.62
been focusing on well let me just change

910.899 --> 917.139
the angle was like well I I can't put

914.62 --> 921.939
about five years ago when when they

917.139 --> 926.23
started the first Facebook group which

921.939 --> 929.41
at that time I I have already worked was

926.23 --> 931.899
aware it just like I've tried to online

929.41 --> 935.279
if there's anything going on with that

931.899 --> 939.25
sub judice as soul was probably not

935.279 --> 941.819
hoping into conspiracies the idea is

939.25 --> 945.61
that I was a huge space

941.819 --> 949.899
you know I can say that third I was

945.61 --> 953.069
obsessed about space and no aliens and

949.899 --> 960.06
stuff like that and man's greatest

953.069 --> 962.889
achievements achievements and so when I

960.06 --> 965.7689999999999
stumble the one weather video YouTube

962.889 --> 968.29
and this happened I was watching the

965.769 --> 970.269
European Space Agency

968.29 --> 972.939
with about the Rosetta mission when they

970.269 --> 974.649
plan on asteroid and there was a bill

972.939 --> 977.649
talking to the side liking the

974.649 --> 980.079
recommendation about leather and they've

977.649 --> 982.809
always known since I was young that all

980.079 --> 984.669
the thousands of years ago people knew

982.809 --> 990.699
dirt splat so I just thought it's

984.669 --> 993.16
something for sure father so I didn't

990.699 --> 997.889
pay attention I didn't watch any of

993.16 --> 1000.959
those I was watching this Eastview for

997.889 --> 1003.689
like multiple times and then once I just

1000.959 --> 1007.2289999999999
studied at all entertain myself so I

1003.689 --> 1010.139
clicked on the third video and then five

1007.229 --> 1012.749
minutes into it I was already into shock

1010.139 --> 1016.049
because I was very good at physics and

1012.749 --> 1019.8290000000001
geometry at that point I stuck in Matt's

1016.049 --> 1022.889
like a big-time cannot put two and two

1019.829 --> 1026.549
together but no geometry and physics I

1022.889 --> 1030.169
was just very good so immediately

1026.549 --> 1033.709
started cracking up my mind I was like I

1030.169 --> 1036.72
was overwhelmed with emotions and

1033.709 --> 1042.059
information so I just immediately

1036.72 --> 1044.519
started you know the stuff that were

1042.059 --> 1046.769
shot it was mostly about the perspective

1044.519 --> 1049.5
and I immediately connected adults and

1046.769 --> 1053.0
in the end of the video it was about 15

1049.5 --> 1056.669
minutes so I ran outside screaming just

1053.0 --> 1058.44
it was summer so I just went outside and

1056.669 --> 1061.6200000000001
I looked at the sky was like planes buy

1058.44 --> 1064.679
more so I immediately started looking at

1061.62 --> 1066.649
the place on the trails no contrails or

1064.679 --> 1069.8090000000002
the entrails

1066.649 --> 1071.549
think we're getting that later and I

1069.809 --> 1074.37
started looking at them and I was like

1071.549 --> 1078.24
well yeah that's perspective and effect

1074.37 --> 1080.789
but wait if there's perspective there

1078.24 --> 1083.25
should be another aspect perspective

1080.789 --> 1086.429
around the ball and I immediately

1083.25 --> 1088.889
realized that it's missing it's not

1086.429 --> 1091.1390000000001
there because planes are not flying

1088.889 --> 1093.299
those down I'll just start to see their

1091.139 --> 1096.019
bellies their own one and it was funny

1093.299 --> 1098.96
isn't it like horizon they don't fly

1096.019 --> 1101.96
like that

1098.96 --> 1104.57
Oh they'd rather flight like oh I'm

1101.96 --> 1107.54
sorry think they're up earlier when we

1104.57 --> 1110.96
[ __ ] comes back I got and I ever

1107.54 --> 1116.72
actually sorry I almost kind I ever

1110.96 --> 1120.29
actually oh yes so yeah I had no great

1116.72 --> 1123.47
knew about I was just talking about like

1120.29 --> 1125.6299999999999
how it looked as a airplane flies into

1123.47 --> 1128.06
the distance it doesn't look like if you

1125.63 --> 1131.63
see the horizon it doesn't look like

1128.06 --> 1133.79
they're going like yeah and then it

1131.63 --> 1135.8600000000001
really looks rather like they're going

1133.79 --> 1138.23
to the horizon and then actually

1135.86 --> 1140.36
leveling out going slow yeah like

1138.23 --> 1142.34
they're going into the distance and

1140.36 --> 1146.81
that's typically yeah the perspective

1142.34 --> 1148.1299999999999
effect yeah yes it works above you as

1146.81 --> 1159.8899999999999
well as below you

1148.13 --> 1162.49
mmhmm yeah slant effective apparent yeah

1159.89 --> 1165.65
it's amazing

1162.49 --> 1169.97
paralyzing it's just in that moment I

1165.65 --> 1173.8400000000001
was like it took me two and a half hours

1169.97 --> 1176.48
to to get to all the tests that I need

1173.84 --> 1180.08
to do and then it took me two weeks to

1176.48 --> 1183.8
perform it for myself so I'm certain and

1180.08 --> 1187.49
then it took me three months to mentally

1183.8 --> 1189.9199999999998
and emotionally accept and that was like

1187.49 --> 1194.27
huge and then I joined this Facebook

1189.92 --> 1197.1200000000001
group and then I was like one of the

1194.27 --> 1199.91
it's up I don't wanna see it as a

1197.12 --> 1203.4799999999998
contribution or anything you just I was

1199.91 --> 1208.3100000000002
looking at discussions under so I was

1203.48 --> 1212.48
seeing people talking about no lies and

1208.31 --> 1216.1699999999998
deceit and money and some certain space

1212.48 --> 1223.55
agencies nothing associated with spaces

1216.17 --> 1226.04
from any agency that masseter nothing

1223.55 --> 1227.06
associated with space in astronomy or

1226.04 --> 1230.18
astrology

1227.06 --> 1231.71
yeah that's NASA so it was talking about

1230.18 --> 1235.04
NASA so then I

1231.71 --> 1237.44
right somebody was thinking about the

1235.04 --> 1239.51
money they spent in and I went from

1237.44 --> 1242.42
NASA's website and some other websites

1239.51 --> 1245.72
and I calculate the date all the money

1242.42 --> 1249.02
they've spent since the forming machine

1245.72 --> 1252.83
had posted in this page and it was for

1249.02 --> 1254.68
Marvel if it just took off I just posted

1252.83 --> 1258.71
it and didn't even know it

1254.68 --> 1261.53
it went huge on its own now it's like so

1258.71 --> 1265.25
happy to watch it go and you know much

1261.53 --> 1270.56
smarter people than me taking it and

1265.25 --> 1273.8
then you know applying all the all the

1270.56 --> 1277.52
logic to it like when describing and mr.

1273.8 --> 1279.86
Smith was I just I just noticed it

1277.52 --> 1282.83
because there's lack of information and

1279.86 --> 1285.56
I did it but then I'm fine with smarter

1282.83 --> 1287.9299999999998
people than me carrying on for the

1285.56 --> 1291.11
future which is pretty hilarious and

1287.93 --> 1293.48
then I started pointing out pictures

1291.11 --> 1295.79
that I discussed with my former physics

1293.48 --> 1299.17
teacher about perspective and angles on

1295.79 --> 1301.7
the width of the human vision so I

1299.17 --> 1304.39
started posting one of the first means

1301.7 --> 1307.94
with angles and distances and

1304.39 --> 1310.16
perspective and stuff that work how fast

1307.94 --> 1314.69
both work in the distance with angles

1310.16 --> 1316.88
and mobile parent rising yeah I took

1314.69 --> 1319.94
really long spoke that night

1316.88 --> 1322.64
yeah let me see if I can get that

1319.94 --> 1325.79
picture presented you wanted me to do

1322.64 --> 1334.76
that that oh yeah the other the nice

1325.79 --> 1337.22
picture are you just the voice would are

1334.76 --> 1340.19
you going with the camera or it's just

1337.22 --> 1343.28
the voice in ya know the camera is fine

1340.19 --> 1345.1100000000001
but your voice does seem

1343.28 --> 1347.0
a little bit muffled made me like the

1345.11 --> 1350.54
sharp tones aren't coming through

1347.0 --> 1352.1
perfectly but yeah I don't know I could

1350.54 --> 1355.3999999999999
still make out what you're saying I

1352.1 --> 1358.25
think the the so can be can the

1355.4 --> 1361.49
listeners alright though I'm gonna

1358.25 --> 1364.27
present your picture for a moment so

1361.49 --> 1364.27
there you go

1364.33 --> 1367.78
it's really good

1369.59 --> 1375.6699999999998
it took me two days to find that picture

1377.86 --> 1384.7099999999998
it was so many of them in guro and now

1381.43 --> 1389.51
there's not even one and I found it from

1384.71 --> 1394.31
the Bulgarian Facebook page but versus

1389.51 --> 1397.7
both quite downloaded from there it's

1394.31 --> 1400.01
really good it's just one of those minor

1397.7 --> 1402.44
details that's actually not really a

1400.01 --> 1408.14
minor detail it's yeah quite in your

1402.44 --> 1414.53
face but yeah people tend to glance over

1408.14 --> 1417.64
it hmm but yeah yeah definitely like the

1414.53 --> 1421.94
way the Sun reflects whatever it is okay

1417.64 --> 1424.5200000000002
the reflection is not on a ball yeah is

1421.94 --> 1427.54
it your nose print no no I am presented

1424.52 --> 1430.52
it again I can move it again if you want

1427.54 --> 1433.79
no because I haven't seen it at all yeah

1430.52 --> 1437.3
no you look you're in the Hangout panel

1433.79 --> 1439.52
huh it doesn't show it dang alright it's

1437.3 --> 1442.24
like a sub thing so I can have guests

1439.52 --> 1445.43
but yeah if you want to actually see

1442.24 --> 1448.07
doing you have to go to the the actual

1445.43 --> 1450.5900000000001
YouTube broadcast voted and then you can

1448.07 --> 1452.6
follow it there I have it open also yeah

1450.59 --> 1454.55
this is the part that I wasn't getting

1452.6 --> 1458.23
with hell that works with hangouts new

1454.55 --> 1461.69
mm yeah actually what's going on yeah

1458.23 --> 1463.46
it's not one unified program yeah yeah

1461.69 --> 1466.46
no but it makes perfect sense to me now

1463.46 --> 1470.0
it's so fine it's I grabbed it

1466.46 --> 1472.19
so yeah the picture is actually was both

1470.0 --> 1475.73
a reflection of light and then a flat

1472.19 --> 1478.64
surface reflecting light so there's like

1475.73 --> 1481.91
in sense that what we've talked about

1478.64 --> 1488.0600000000002
earlier that for example on Nathan's

1481.91 --> 1491.3300000000002
show when you him and Aaron and Anthony

1488.06 --> 1494.9299999999998
are discussing would go pets or globe

1491.33 --> 1497.9199999999998
believers that about the parent horizon

1494.93 --> 1501.3500000000001
optical phenomenon of diffraction

1497.92 --> 1503.03
reaction distraction I like the Schwartz

1501.35 --> 1505.01
along the boson

1503.03 --> 1508.6399999999999
it's like they just want to use this

1505.01 --> 1511.19
distraction right from Suffern oh yeah

1508.64 --> 1515.0
bypassing the argument with red herrings

1511.19 --> 1517.91
and straw men yeah exactly so basically

1515.0 --> 1521.9
the point that I made to you earlier was

1517.91 --> 1525.89
that it's a we have to take a step back

1521.9 --> 1529.76
with discussing this covers because you

1525.89 --> 1532.64
know there is no bendy water so my point

1529.76 --> 1536.69
was that when actually Nathan goes into

1532.64 --> 1539.63
arguments with anybody

1536.69 --> 1541.91
concerning footage taken over long

1539.63 --> 1545.0900000000001
distances over water or even over

1541.91 --> 1549.1100000000001
flatlander them on both water mostly is

1545.09 --> 1552.73
that it's like giving them art or

1549.11 --> 1557.33
assuming art because we actually did not

1552.73 --> 1560.48
we have to let's say proof that mirages

1557.33 --> 1567.4099999999999
and all those optical effects are

1560.48 --> 1569.45
possible on a curved area of water and

1567.41 --> 1572.3600000000001
we don't know that because movies is

1569.45 --> 1575.72
flat so blackness is making them

1572.36 --> 1578.84
possible so that's a curved surface I

1575.72 --> 1581.6000000000001
doubt who you City drank we have

1578.84 --> 1584.27
animation but there's so much we

1581.6 --> 1587.51
wouldn't see that we do because you're

1584.27 --> 1589.61
Nathan likes to remind everybody timing

1587.51 --> 1591.35
again that yeah if you're standing on a

1589.61 --> 1593.8999999999999
ball if you look at the horizon you're

1591.35 --> 1596.48
going to be looking downwards yeah of

1593.9 --> 1603.3500000000001
course and you know that never really

1596.48 --> 1606.05
happens so we should all be staring down

1603.35 --> 1612.1999999999998
on it from the plane but it's outside of

1606.05 --> 1615.4099999999999
the window right yeah but that kind of

1612.2 --> 1618.79
basic hardcore facts doesn't really stop

1615.41 --> 1622.7900000000002
the whole process because yeah in a way

1618.79 --> 1625.1599999999999
their question baggers and if you don't

1622.79 --> 1626.96
allow them they'll go nuts and there

1625.16 --> 1629.15
will be no more discussion they'll just

1626.96 --> 1631.64
be fuming at foaming-at-the-mouth being

1629.15 --> 1632.9
really pissed off like you're not giving

1631.64 --> 1635.63
us an inch

1632.9 --> 1640.22
it's like yeah but you're taking the

1635.63 --> 1642.23
wrong inch you just want more and that's

1640.22 --> 1643.25
it that's the whole neurotic process and

1642.23 --> 1644.63
you don't even get it

1643.25 --> 1647.78
you don't know what you're doing

1644.63 --> 1650.5100000000002
literally you're letting yourself be

1647.78 --> 1653.1499999999999
guided by a religious dream and trying

1650.51 --> 1654.58
to make headway make more room for the

1653.15 --> 1657.23
dream and you're not actually

1654.58 --> 1658.28
assimilating facts and details that are

1657.23 --> 1660.92
being presented to you

1658.28 --> 1662.96
you're both passing them we're

1660.92 --> 1665.3600000000001
overcoming them to get to that point

1662.96 --> 1669.47
that you can again make more room for

1665.36 --> 1671.2099999999998
the dream yeah that's right expand upon

1669.47 --> 1674.78
the dream and there is a positional

1671.21 --> 1677.38
systems that it's based on yeah

1674.78 --> 1680.1499999999999
psychology is amazing

1677.38 --> 1686.8400000000001
absolutely you know cannot agree more

1680.15 --> 1690.23
I'm sorry if I'm causing just like I

1686.84 --> 1692.6899999999998
can't see myself you know I just stopped

1690.23 --> 1698.809
the audio yeah it's a bit funny though

1692.69 --> 1702.3500000000001
the way I look yeah that's okay you're a

1698.809 --> 1705.5
pretty handsome guy thanks very Slavic

1702.35 --> 1708.32
you know you know and you got a mustache

1705.5 --> 1714.8
that's the most important

1708.32 --> 1718.34
that's that's a compliment - bro - I I

1714.8 --> 1719.96
keep it like it was most in the fan you

1718.34 --> 1723.74
know the other day I was listening on of

1719.96 --> 1727.67
this feather debates and I had the idea

1723.74 --> 1729.98
that when Nathan asks for any signs of

1727.67 --> 1732.17
hurt elbow ya think I know something

1729.98 --> 1738.32
I've heard you say them on like yeah

1732.17 --> 1741.22
Aaron that's right that's so good you

1738.32 --> 1741.22
just have to bring it up

1746.38 --> 1752.7990000000002
I think I missed what you're saying the

1749.95 --> 1756.6390000000001
the when Natan asks for sign of

1752.799 --> 1760.059
curvature and you said on on females

1756.639 --> 1762.4289999999999
that found curvature I was thinking

1760.059 --> 1764.62
about saying that but then I I've

1762.429 --> 1766.3300000000002
listened to another show I've heard you

1764.62 --> 1770.799
saying that now like yeah that's right

1766.33 --> 1774.46
Allen me

1770.799 --> 1778.69
did I say curvature yeah you said I'm a

1774.46 --> 1781.059
female body oh yeah yeah well curvature

1778.69 --> 1784.1200000000001
so low for the human body it's just not

1781.059 --> 1786.22
on the earth you know yeah you can't go

1784.12 --> 1798.4799999999998
looking for curvature mother has he got

1786.22 --> 1801.73
a look at on the humans is Monday so

1798.48 --> 1804.519
what you know the topic I think you

1801.73 --> 1808.74
because we talked about planes a bit and

1804.519 --> 1811.96
I mentioned that I was either work.we I

1808.74 --> 1816.159
think you brought the topic about planes

1811.96 --> 1818.6490000000001
in a big old er show about them flying

1816.159 --> 1822.49
with some certain technology that's not

1818.649 --> 1826.029
this post or Matthews you write the the

1822.49 --> 1829.289
hidden modernized engines yeah that the

1826.029 --> 1832.809
probably the the vacuum compressed

1829.289 --> 1836.139
engines that yeah yeah barely need any

1832.809 --> 1840.519
fuel source to to do what they do and

1836.139 --> 1844.059
they have natural levitation effect so

1840.519 --> 1847.1200000000001
that planes can just almost just hover

1844.059 --> 1850.72
help yeah they are not really that

1847.12 --> 1853.4089999999999
dependent on the aerodynamics of being

1850.72 --> 1857.519
propelled that much it's it's amazing

1853.409 --> 1860.019
yeah yeah they are there they are

1857.519 --> 1862.059
yeah the bigger ones it is I don't know

1860.019 --> 1863.139
about the smaller planes but the the big

1862.059 --> 1865.99
jets

1863.139 --> 1869.9499999999998
they make maneuvers that just don't make

1865.99 --> 1872.5
any sense and you know and we seen the

1869.95 --> 1875.5900000000001
video of the year was a created a big

1872.5 --> 1879.15
one when it's on a air show and it's

1875.59 --> 1882.4199999999998
flying like 4050 miles

1879.15 --> 1885.5590000000002
about 40 50 miles per hour above the

1882.42 --> 1889.5900000000001
crowd like very low it's like almost

1885.559 --> 1893.1
stopped in the mirror now I didn't see

1889.59 --> 1896.22
that but I can't imagine yeah you could

1893.1 --> 1901.4399999999998
do that just ridiculous it's like you're

1896.22 --> 1904.58
watching this you know this starts with

1901.44 --> 1906.5700000000002
Z it's like elongated the helium thing

1904.58 --> 1908.61
sorry

1906.57 --> 1910.71
you know these you don't get it you

1908.61 --> 1920.37
don't get it helium balloons that they

1910.71 --> 1922.92
use for limbs like later no I use it as

1920.37 --> 1926.4899999999998
a kind of transportation device back in

1922.92 --> 1928.559
the days boom a long one and it has this

1926.49 --> 1932.25
fault with the people underneath it

1928.559 --> 1937.02
alright what's it called again not a

1932.25 --> 1940.559
blimp yeah no is abloom all right light

1937.02 --> 1943.679
bulb like the Heisenberg basically yeah

1940.559 --> 1949.6789999999999
so you know it's kind of it looks like a

1943.679 --> 1952.74
blimp just not that moving like how it

1949.679 --> 1955.38
should be weighing something about 330

1952.74 --> 1958.95
tons and it's sitting in one place and

1955.38 --> 1966.14
it needs the minimal takeoff speed 270

1958.95 --> 1971.49
kilometers right well i theorize pretty

1966.14 --> 1978.47
that why that works is because field it

1971.49 --> 1978.47
generates that its weight is relieved

1979.46 --> 1983.71
well I think it has something to do with

1983.83 --> 1988.9099999999999
the front part of the turbine which is

1986.57 --> 1990.74
compressing the air I have seen some

1988.91 --> 1992.6000000000001
videos in their work showing that they

1990.74 --> 1996.76
make some certain sound in their range

1992.6 --> 2001.6599999999999
in an order they go from being really

1996.76 --> 2003.04
big to becoming really small so it's

2001.66 --> 2006.52
like the piano keys

2003.04 --> 2009.22
if you move your finger finger along and

2006.52 --> 2012.28
they start from a high note and then it

2009.22 --> 2014.68
goes too low no I think there's it

2012.28 --> 2017.47
there's something something to do with

2014.68 --> 2019.69
that and then there's the other part

2017.47 --> 2022.51
that I've heard that the hyper excite

2019.69 --> 2025.5700000000002
nitrogen in the atmosphere and nitrogen

2022.51 --> 2026.44
actually improves it doesn't export it

2025.57 --> 2029.11
implodes

2026.44 --> 2031.3
so in the vacuum chamber you actually

2029.11 --> 2034.78
introduce an implosion which creates a

2031.3 --> 2036.94
vacuum which tries to sit even more of

2034.78 --> 2040.48
the upcoming year and actually I think

2036.94 --> 2042.99
as part of mix makes some logic I

2040.48 --> 2046.51
haven't moved that that that's also how

2042.99 --> 2050.53
is the name again how turbos work I

2046.51 --> 2054.43
think how jet engines even work

2050.53 --> 2057.55
they have like a pre step technological

2054.43 --> 2060.1
wise that kind of already used that it's

2057.55 --> 2064.02
just like a jet engines just a giant

2060.1 --> 2067.24
sucking to basically like super powerful

2064.02 --> 2072.03
- that just sucks the air through it and

2067.24 --> 2074.5299999999997
that's the engine of a jet and they

2072.03 --> 2079.8300000000004
expanded upon this probably and then

2074.53 --> 2079.8300000000004
applied it to these jumbo jet planes

2079.95 --> 2089.85
yeah they do it they went from jets to

2085.32 --> 2092.01
turbofan so it they're the same but

2089.85 --> 2096.81
there is a smaller current better

2092.01 --> 2098.9700000000003
yeah the one the older ones are called

2096.81 --> 2100.89
turbojet engines and other to the fan

2098.97 --> 2103.5
because they're actually using the

2100.89 --> 2106.47
folder to push instead of out there and

2103.5 --> 2112.49
back in the days this only hotel pushing

2106.47 --> 2115.1699999999996
so probably this advancement created or

2112.49 --> 2116.3999999999996
energy or fuel efficient because if you

2115.17 --> 2122.01
look at the structure of this aircraft

2116.4 --> 2126.48
there is no way that it can support 120

2122.01 --> 2127.25
tons in each wing yeah as a fuel no no

2126.48 --> 2131.67
way

2127.25 --> 2136.29
66 66 tons of aluminum cannot support

2131.67 --> 2139.38
hundred and 20 tons of fuel with I don't

2136.29 --> 2142.38
know what was like they were not on with

2139.38 --> 2143.85
our severe torsion yes that would that

2142.38 --> 2146.52
all that weight would be sitting

2143.85 --> 2148.38
supposedly in these wings that would

2146.52 --> 2151.92
makes the wings would make the wings

2148.38 --> 2156.21
really heavy and clunky and like in the

2151.92 --> 2159.7400000000002
way yeah that's like when I kiss my Lori

2156.21 --> 2159.7400000000002
a coconut not not really but

2162.25 --> 2169.69
yeah it would be overweight it will

2165.01 --> 2172.51
create torsion yeah definitely

2169.69 --> 2175.87
and there was a guy post to the video

2172.51 --> 2178.63
about a fight that he was getting on and

2175.87 --> 2180.43
he he asked the guy that was feeling the

2178.63 --> 2185.35
pain how much fuel they happened to set

2180.43 --> 2188.3799999999997
something like 4,600 meters which is

2185.35 --> 2191.44
like a very very small amount like

2188.38 --> 2195.1
insanely small compared what they should

2191.44 --> 2199.29
have and it's like a three four-hour

2195.1 --> 2199.29
flight it doesn't make any sense

2199.65 --> 2208.96
well not if you assume that it's just

2202.66 --> 2210.43
all old technology nearly but yeah hey

2208.96 --> 2213.75
I'm the other hand I'm kind of glad that

2210.43 --> 2215.04
they Utley that they do have it you know

2213.75 --> 2218.86
mm-hmm

2215.04 --> 2220.72
it sounds like a really good efficient

2218.86 --> 2222.19
technology and I'm kind of glad that

2220.72 --> 2224.7999999999997
they're using it even though they're

2222.19 --> 2227.4
trying to hide it from us yeah it's good

2224.8 --> 2231.27
to know when I play now I'm like

2227.4 --> 2235.06
marveling it than much more it's like

2231.27 --> 2238.33
it's much more than that you thought it

2235.06 --> 2245.71
is it's actually incredibly amazing that

2238.33 --> 2249.85
piece of machinery you see the part of

2245.71 --> 2250.36
my room which many years before I become

2249.85 --> 2262.0299999999997
a platter

2250.36 --> 2268.54
all right I don't know if that it does

2262.03 --> 2271.09
just I just want it to look like that I

2268.54 --> 2278.58
don't know why it is these are nice and

2271.09 --> 2278.58
then it don't mom me wait don't you yeah

2278.88 --> 2285.2200000000003
and there's I want to show you another

2281.14 --> 2287.68
thing sorry for the mess a picture for a

2285.22 --> 2290.7999999999997
few seconds but then there's this thing

2287.68 --> 2294.14
just with my laptop then there's this

2290.8 --> 2299.299
thing on the wall that I

2294.14 --> 2303.44
I'm just trying I'm currently looking at

2299.299 --> 2305.96
YouTube I should transfer to the the

2303.44 --> 2308.599
live feed because it's like a jigsaw

2305.96 --> 2308.96
related I don't know how many yeah I see

2308.599 --> 2312.259
it

2308.96 --> 2315.589
dolphins in outer space and and then

2312.259 --> 2318.799
getting into water that's really getting

2315.589 --> 2322.42
into flat earth and time to hear the

2318.799 --> 2322.42
stuff about the Bible and the water is

2322.96 --> 2328.759
like I have this for so long it's been

2326.329 --> 2331.849
just seeing for all this time about my

2328.759 --> 2334.869
headings like it stuff like that just a

2331.849 --> 2337.2200000000003
coincidence or it's just like the

2334.869 --> 2342.4990000000003
intelligence that created this is Frank

2337.22 --> 2346.1189999999997
show you something I don't know I wonder

2342.499 --> 2350.269
sometimes how ideas even arrive to

2346.119 --> 2353.38
individual Minds like like dill from

2350.269 --> 2360.9199999999996
Scotland goes and asks people original

2353.38 --> 2367.039
just you know the rest original thought

2360.92 --> 2371.509
or it's a programmed response I don't

2367.039 --> 2376.2200000000003
know like inspiration is original really

2371.509 --> 2380.9
comes from your own heart but where is

2376.22 --> 2386.049
that input coming from you know is that

2380.9 --> 2389.599
just the program the creator gives us

2386.049 --> 2395.18
and and it is actually secretly a part

2389.599 --> 2397.9990000000003
in in a much wider picture and it has

2395.18 --> 2400.3089999999997
things hidden in it that yeah at the

2397.999 --> 2402.2
time you get it you don't or you

2400.309 --> 2407.42
probably won't even fully understand

2402.2 --> 2411.41
what it means but it was thought out on

2407.42 --> 2414.41
the other side so later you may realize

2411.41 --> 2416.49
like what whoa what is this that I did

2414.41 --> 2420.42
and I have this very blade

2416.49 --> 2423.1189999999997
li with but with my goldsmithing and my

2420.42 --> 2427.41
symbolics research which I did like in

2423.119 --> 2430.4100000000003
2006 mmm and even then I knew like oh my

2427.41 --> 2433.44
god I got this these symbols and I'm

2430.41 --> 2435.21
seeing this incredible stuff and thought

2433.44 --> 2437.66
of like all the sleepers and awakened

2435.21 --> 2440.64
and that's gonna happen it's like a

2437.66 --> 2443.0
cultural mental thing that's gonna

2440.64 --> 2445.17
happen and I didn't even really

2443.0 --> 2447.99
consciously know about Flat Earth or

2445.17 --> 2450.08
anything I had no idea of the depth no

2447.99 --> 2456.06
idea of the details but I already saw

2450.08 --> 2458.8199999999997
the movie the shape of things about to

2456.06 --> 2460.2599999999998
unfold back then it's it was an amazing

2458.82 --> 2464.4900000000002
experience but yeah

2460.26 --> 2466.6800000000003
the more you got to get to see the more

2464.49 --> 2470.2799999999997
I get the feeling like yeah it's not

2466.68 --> 2474.4199999999996
actually mine it's just being handed to

2470.28 --> 2477.119
me by the Creator I think it's like you

2474.42 --> 2481.4900000000002
know Nikola Tesla the my neighbor the

2477.119 --> 2485.84
Serbian guy he he got everything into

2481.49 --> 2488.8399999999997
his dreams thinks that in his dreams

2485.84 --> 2488.84
made

2494.839 --> 2502.249
so where did that the information

2496.849 --> 2507.469
careful well I would say from the

2502.249 --> 2510.529
Akashic library yeah you you get a book

2507.469 --> 2514.549
from that library then you get to read

2510.529 --> 2517.089
it and it you can it inspires you you

2514.549 --> 2523.939
can do something with it

2517.089 --> 2528.439
but yeah it's the library is just huge

2523.939 --> 2529.009
is all-encompassing and you can't handle

2528.439 --> 2532.459
it all

2529.009 --> 2536.7690000000002
nobody really can yeah you can only take

2532.459 --> 2539.839
fragments of it until you are obviously

2536.769 --> 2543.019
instinctively saturated and then you

2539.839 --> 2546.799
drop it then you you just deal with what

2543.019 --> 2548.8999999999996
you got from it okay that all that other

2546.799 --> 2552.409
stuff I'll leave that to other people or

2548.9 --> 2553.13
it will come later yeah because we're

2552.409 --> 2561.799
only human

2553.13 --> 2565.849
yeah of course bullet all at once all

2561.799 --> 2568.189
right sorry tonight when I because I

2565.849 --> 2574.089
said information and when it's coming

2568.189 --> 2578.1789999999996
from just wanna bring that top it's like

2574.089 --> 2581.719
the argument where is it evolution or

2578.179 --> 2584.509
you know or creation and then the Big

2581.719 --> 2587.929
Bang or creation which like Big Bang in

2584.509 --> 2590.39
the world small thing you should sorry I

2587.929 --> 2595.64
don't know swearing it's right just

2590.39 --> 2598.969
don't make a habit of it no I'm just

2595.64 --> 2603.609
thinking about it that place won't speak

2598.969 --> 2607.7290000000003
it out that way so let's say for example

2603.609 --> 2610.419
if everything exploded out of nothing

2607.729 --> 2613.0389999999998
which was never certain nature about

2610.419 --> 2616.749
something getting created by nothing so

2613.039 --> 2622.4500000000003
is something that creates something and

2616.749 --> 2626.74
then if if that was the case there

2622.45 --> 2630.8489999999997
the book had deletes when it exploded

2626.74 --> 2634.359
where did it go the information from how

2630.849 --> 2635.65
to arrange itself and stuff oh I can

2634.359 --> 2639.819
respond to that from a global

2635.65 --> 2643.809
perspective perspective the information

2639.819 --> 2648.96
was inherent to it all alone it's all

2643.809 --> 2654.4500000000003
part of the pattern of it all okay so

2648.96 --> 2660.819
information was wasn't affected by the

2654.45 --> 2663.0
worst of it by the singular the scene

2660.819 --> 2665.92
you know the singularity singularity

2663.0 --> 2668.41
yeah that first we don't affect the

2665.92 --> 2672.9
information so I transferred matter so

2668.41 --> 2675.49
it already knew how to render well

2672.9 --> 2677.65
knowing how to arrange itself it's more

2675.49 --> 2680.89
in from my philosophical point of view

2677.65 --> 2682.329
in that and I I've had that concept for

2680.89 --> 2684.46
over twenty years

2682.329 --> 2688.2400000000002
like into my teens I thought of pattern

2684.46 --> 2690.609
ISM and the pattern of it all then the

2688.24 --> 2695.609
information is always there whatever

2690.609 --> 2699.339
happens to it it's just ingrained in

2695.609 --> 2702.609
matter and energy itself yeah that's

2699.339 --> 2704.64
just how things crystallize yeah exactly

2702.609 --> 2707.619
I will just some help to point out our

2704.64 --> 2709.72
water list crystallizes when it gets

2707.619 --> 2712.299
older and older it you know the shame

2709.72 --> 2714.3689999999997
that it wants to take and we all know

2712.299 --> 2717.16
that in the information is already there

2714.369 --> 2718.839
is just them trying to tell us that it

2717.16 --> 2724.74
came from a big back he's just

2718.839 --> 2724.74
absolutely because it's just nonsense

2725.19 --> 2736.119
yeah well yeah I think I fetched it it's

2731.74 --> 2738.2799999999997
like how do you even begin to move

2736.119 --> 2739.9500000000003
beyond some kind of presupposition at

2738.28 --> 2743.309
that and actually

2739.95 --> 2746.16
get some tangible proof for that that

2743.309 --> 2749.369
are not just oh look at the red the red

2746.16 --> 2751.799
shift and the blue shift and of what is

2749.369 --> 2753.54
supposedly out there prisoners I think

2751.799 --> 2757.02
that's actually physical matter and

2753.54 --> 2759.96
everything yeah

2757.02 --> 2763.109
our owner never get to that point yeah

2759.96 --> 2765.9
never through this endless space you can

2763.109 --> 2770.19
observe endlessly you'll never get to it

2765.9 --> 2776.1600000000003
right I really are you familiar with the

2770.19 --> 2779.16
motor Russell not in a direct sense the

2776.16 --> 2783.69
name rings a bell can you explain it was

2779.16 --> 2788.3999999999996
a scientist actually and there's a book

2783.69 --> 2791.579
that he published I don't know 19th

2788.4 --> 2795.63
century and then there's a guy on

2791.579 --> 2797.76
YouTube that's made a video and he's

2795.63 --> 2799.319
narrating the video and he's showing

2797.76 --> 2802.26
stuff from the book and explaining

2799.319 --> 2804.7799999999997
Walter Russell sport and it has to do

2802.26 --> 2806.67
with actually what we're just speaking

2804.78 --> 2809.52
about so maybe for the audience on

2806.67 --> 2812.549
YouTube it just go and have a look it's

2809.52 --> 2815.4
called water also new concept from for

2812.549 --> 2817.14
the universe for new concept universe

2815.4 --> 2820.71
something like that you just find it

2817.14 --> 2825.839
it's like four part video and then it's

2820.71 --> 2832.049
just explained how everything is

2825.839 --> 2835.589
arranged first in energetical state and

2832.049 --> 2838.23
then it condenses the certain amount of

2835.589 --> 2840.42
electricity would actually create is the

2838.23 --> 2841.92
visible matter and they just explain

2840.42 --> 2845.9700000000003
that everything is just electrical

2841.92 --> 2849.599
charge it's really interesting stuff and

2845.97 --> 2851.609
he actually created the know the

2849.599 --> 2857.88
periodic table of the elements long

2851.609 --> 2859.5
before Mendeleev did sorry I didn't

2857.88 --> 2861.9
catch that last part

2859.5 --> 2863.7
he created the periodic table of the

2861.9 --> 2866.64
elements way before

2863.7 --> 2870.0
Mendeleev so you ready yeah and it

2866.64 --> 2873.71
starts with either the first element Wow

2870.0 --> 2883.2
and it's only five very very well with

2873.71 --> 2884.55
wavelengths every single kind of the

2883.2 --> 2885.77
different parts of them you know the

2884.55 --> 2887.849
different elements they're all

2885.77 --> 2892.22
everything described about them

2887.849 --> 2894.63
different they're like all the physical

2892.22 --> 2897.6299999999997
aspects they have to them there

2894.63 --> 2899.4300000000003
it's just I'm not that smart I'm just

2897.63 --> 2902.609
good at foreign stuff off the people

2899.43 --> 2905.31
what they can going oh it sounds really

2902.609 --> 2907.5299999999997
fascinating you look if you if you can

2905.31 --> 2911.73
find a direct link you know it's right

2907.53 --> 2914.09
so drink your milk Chuck what where I'll

2911.73 --> 2917.46
have to post the link in the chat nah

2914.09 --> 2920.609
you're just nothing will post it in our

2917.46 --> 2923.52
Skype feed all right and I'll post it in

2920.609 --> 2927.89
chat all right just give me one second

2923.52 --> 2927.89
III watch these recent like two days ago

2932.84 --> 2939.9700000000003
the concept of the University of

2934.82 --> 2946.76
Waterloo so the channel name is 7 7 g

2939.97 --> 2949.64
slinger just put those two the guy that

2946.76 --> 2952.46
made the videos highly appreciated that

2949.64 --> 2954.44
put the time and effort for people like

2952.46 --> 2958.9
me that won't be able to understand when

2954.44 --> 2963.92
everything when they read that book so

2958.9 --> 2976.79
I'm I'm saying over Skype you want yes

2963.92 --> 2982.07
in our one-on-one Skype feed yeah but

2976.79 --> 2984.29
actually in you like it proves the

2982.07 --> 2987.2000000000003
creator or God as you want to look at it

2984.29 --> 2990.11
in his first sentence like the made the

2987.2 --> 2993.98
biggest misconception of Sciences he

2990.11 --> 2996.29
says that shut down creator out of his

2993.98 --> 3004.39
creation and they that's why they cannot

2996.29 --> 3006.1
understand and explain how support by

3004.39 --> 3008.71
the way Thank You Daniel field for the

3006.1 --> 3010.45
super chat earlier it's too much in a

3008.71 --> 3014.59
conversation to address it but thank you

3010.45 --> 3017.77
very much for that sorry feel free to

3014.59 --> 3020.7400000000002
interrupt me need time no but yeah I

3017.77 --> 3024.12
feel free but it's just tough to do cuz

3020.74 --> 3028.72
it's really interesting part to bring

3024.12 --> 3031.0
I'll be sticking around on your show as

3028.72 --> 3032.6499999999996
as as long as you like me to be in it

3031.0 --> 3035.05
it's just if you ask

3032.65 --> 3038.7400000000002
I have no no issues with it he'll be

3035.05 --> 3041.6200000000003
Afghani time and then on Nathan's show I

3038.74 --> 3048.2799999999997
started getting fed up with Rovers last

3041.62 --> 3050.7999999999997
year so I'm now being I'll be not

3048.28 --> 3054.1600000000003
helping them let's say in any way shape

3050.8 --> 3056.67
or form I can say the same for myself

3054.16 --> 3056.67
though

3056.94 --> 3069.18
like I yeah they're devious but I don't

3063.15 --> 3073.14
know I have like I don't even know how

3069.18 --> 3075.18
to explain it it's just that I was so

3073.14 --> 3078.0299999999997
disappointed that I couldn't actually be

3075.18 --> 3080.25
part of NASA oh my god

3078.03 --> 3085.5
that I'm like from the Flat Earth side

3080.25 --> 3090.42
trying to make my revenge by improving

3085.5 --> 3093.42
their system from the other side yeah

3090.42 --> 3096.06
this doesn't work and this is right and

3093.42 --> 3098.01
if you had only presuppose it in a

3096.06 --> 3101.37
different way then much more will

3098.01 --> 3103.9500000000003
actually work out because get it I get

3101.37 --> 3107.3399999999997
how it works I get how they do it and I

3103.95 --> 3110.91
love doing it like as a weird hobby I

3107.34 --> 3121.6800000000003
guess yeah to me the whole NASA space

3110.91 --> 3124.79
stuffer is like the ultimate Legos just

3121.68 --> 3127.44
trying to help me from the site awesome

3124.79 --> 3129.39
look I'm not gonna lie about everything

3127.44 --> 3133.02
I'm absolutely not gonna be silent about

3129.39 --> 3136.65
Flat Earth because I can't

3133.02 --> 3139.29
yeah but we like we know the way among

3136.65 --> 3142.98
guys you could do better than that old

3139.29 --> 3147.3
[ __ ] yeah and they're being so political

3142.98 --> 3150.51
about it and it doesn't work people are

3147.3 --> 3153.6600000000003
wising up on so many levels and that

3150.51 --> 3156.21
just doesn't work anymore may have

3153.66 --> 3158.5499999999997
worked in the 70s in the 80s and but now

3156.21 --> 3162.9
no too much has happened too much has

3158.55 --> 3165.6600000000003
been learned and when you learn some

3162.9 --> 3170.67
stuff you not only learn them that's

3165.66 --> 3173.8199999999997
right I I say that five years down the

3170.67 --> 3175.8
road it will be the ballers that will

3173.82 --> 3178.1400000000003
have those debates instead of other

3175.8 --> 3182.1600000000003
girls I think will be man not mainstream

3178.14 --> 3184.5899999999997
but widely accepted I don't see it more

3182.16 --> 3188.85
than five years I think it's about two

3184.59 --> 3190.6600000000003
years that will be everywhere mainstream

3188.85 --> 3196.9
everything will be about

3190.66 --> 3199.45
if I almost shiver at the idea of it yes

3196.9 --> 3201.9100000000003
when you think about it cuz these groups

3199.45 --> 3203.339
that have done that there will be under

3201.91 --> 3206.6499999999996
so much pressure

3203.339 --> 3210.099
yeah it will be disruptive about the way

3206.65 --> 3216.46
of life actually very disruptive but

3210.099 --> 3220.869
that's reality I just I just cannot

3216.46 --> 3223.69
avoid it I see it I can help cannot help

3220.869 --> 3227.859
myself I just hate being like I cannot

3223.69 --> 3234.91
stand it right and we just want to move

3227.859 --> 3237.8489999999997
on yeah progress look thanks for like

3234.91 --> 3241.1189999999997
not working thing to do alright

3237.849 --> 3243.9700000000003
and also like a financial system all

3241.119 --> 3247.539
that it's being compressed so we don't

3243.97 --> 3250.779
have room to just throw away giant piles

3247.539 --> 3253.42
of money into some dream yeah well we

3250.779 --> 3256.92
could use that to actually improve the

3253.42 --> 3259.75
world with real knowledge and real

3256.92 --> 3265.2690000000002
technical progress that makes much more

3259.75 --> 3266.98
sense instead of yeah latching all on to

3265.269 --> 3276.3689999999997
that dream as everything crumbles around

3266.98 --> 3279.64
us yeah but in a way yeah it's almost

3276.369 --> 3281.8900000000003
kind of sad to me because maybe it's the

3279.64 --> 3284.3489999999997
wrong word it's just like I still do

3281.89 --> 3288.0989999999997
love the whole space concept and I think

3284.349 --> 3291.88
that was glorious and I wouldn't want to

3288.099 --> 3295.1800000000003
say that like being banned or something

3291.88 --> 3298.42
you know I can yeah it's all a lie no

3295.18 --> 3299.98
more science fiction no I know what the

3298.42 --> 3303.2200000000003
hell what are you doing

3299.98 --> 3303.97
it's a storytelling yeah and it's

3303.22 --> 3306.97
amazing

3303.97 --> 3309.1899999999996
I enjoy every sci-fi movie I'm still

3306.97 --> 3310.9599999999996
digging today I know the concept I know

3309.19 --> 3312.67
how it should work so it's fine with

3310.96 --> 3314.589
this by the Fisher world that they

3312.67 --> 3318.039
failed though just that's not confusing

3314.589 --> 3321.22
but we ought but I still watch Star Wars

3318.039 --> 3325.6600000000003
as too much you know every every bit of

3321.22 --> 3330.0699999999997
space thing like box art Ram

3325.66 --> 3331.99
yeah I love the Star Trek series Star

3330.07 --> 3335.77
Trek is awesome as well yeah although

3331.99 --> 3343.06
they are really pushing it harder harder

3335.77 --> 3346.21
there's a cultural like come on don't do

3343.06 --> 3348.0099999999998
that come on do it like they did it in

3346.21 --> 3350.29
the 90s it was so good it was so

3348.01 --> 3352.5400000000004
sensible everybody was so civilized so

3350.29 --> 3360.63
hopeful why are you all turning into

3352.54 --> 3363.61
these conflicted sighs people yeah I

3360.63 --> 3365.71
remember when I was young and I used to

3363.61 --> 3368.56
watch the world it's like every every

3365.71 --> 3372.28
Syfy show that we did back in the day

3368.56 --> 3375.43
it's like cuz I'm I'm Bolin 86 so I'm

3372.28 --> 3379.98
like 30 in a few days I'll be 33 years

3375.43 --> 3379.98
old no say ah well that's 33 dude guys

3381.03 --> 3391.9300000000003
we got another one you're taking over

3387.19 --> 3395.8
role because he just turned 34 so you're

3391.93 --> 3397.96
taking over oh I'm sorry

3395.8 --> 3399.94
yeah Reese only sheeple can see he's

3397.96 --> 3403.81
been on the show many times well I

3399.94 --> 3406.48
turned 34 was it yesterday or the day

3403.81 --> 3409.36
before so you're taking over here oh

3406.48 --> 3415.75
yeah please my star sign

3409.36 --> 3418.3
fish minds I'm a water guy I carry the

3415.75 --> 3420.6
artery and make flasks on my head

3418.3 --> 3420.6000000000004
apparently

3423.2 --> 3440.6699999999996
so there was something interesting that

3428.19 --> 3445.05
was wanted to say out of my head in our

3440.67 --> 3452.67
ass in what direction there's something

3445.05 --> 3457.32
something to do it right oh yes it was

3452.67 --> 3460.5
something was about the the horizon

3457.32 --> 3465.15
perspective type issues about we had

3460.5 --> 3467.25
that puzzle optics no no more about the

3465.15 --> 3471.1800000000003
the information and how life started

3467.25 --> 3474.38
yeah I think you mean life yeah now I

3471.18 --> 3478.1699999999996
remember I remember now it was about the

3474.38 --> 3482.089
thing with the evolution like when it

3478.17 --> 3484.44
began like the official narrative it's

3482.089 --> 3487.95
absolutely impossible cuz they want to

3484.44 --> 3489.9900000000002
tell you that in water so amino acid

3487.95 --> 3495.2999999999997
started forming and they formed small

3489.99 --> 3497.339
cell organisms and so on and so yeah and

3495.3 --> 3498.9900000000002
then okay

3497.339 --> 3502.71
let's give them that they actually

3498.99 --> 3504.4799999999996
formed and they can now have to prove

3502.71 --> 3510.45
how long can a single cell organism

3504.48 --> 3514.44
survive how long it will take for

3510.45 --> 3518.6299999999997
another one you create nothing if the

3514.44 --> 3521.04
first one dies and then why is it

3518.63 --> 3522.9300000000003
stopped why is it not happening now

3521.04 --> 3527.92
single celled organisms should be

3522.93 --> 3530.999
appearing everywhere in water no water

3527.92 --> 3530.9990000000003
[Music]

3531.53 --> 3537.2400000000002
sort of no yes so they say they say yeah

3535.17 --> 3539.79
that's the bacteria and yet yes because

3537.24 --> 3544.95
being contaminated but if it's like

3539.79 --> 3548.099
motive fresh or saltwater that's outside

3544.95 --> 3551.3999999999996
somewhere it's a natural occurring body

3548.099 --> 3555.27
of water it's a full pass right the

3551.4 --> 3556.29
swipe is actually water basically first

3555.27 --> 3562.55
of all

3556.29 --> 3571.109
and then water with a wall yeah isn't it

3562.55 --> 3573.44
yeah yep yeah but are they as heavy

3571.109 --> 3573.44
stuff

3575.79 --> 3582.22
it's just that the the whole the the

3579.43 --> 3584.2599999999998
large species the species evolution

3582.22 --> 3587.1699999999996
especially if you're gonna try to point

3584.26 --> 3590.71
at the beginnings of it that story is

3587.17 --> 3597.2200000000003
just so convoluted you know we can

3590.71 --> 3600.61
definitely prove adaption and like when

3597.22 --> 3605.9199999999996
yeah more complex organisms are involved

3600.61 --> 3607.96
like mammals humans that adaptation is a

3605.92 --> 3611.11
thing that they're simply even like

3607.96 --> 3613.2400000000002
genetic modification people that study

3611.11 --> 3617.86
this [ __ ] even confirm this it's like

3613.24 --> 3621.49
yeah if the blueprint is too far out of

3617.86 --> 3624.01
the original then you get side effects

3621.49 --> 3628.7999999999997
you get things like become sterile or

3624.01 --> 3633.4
behavior becomes erratic or certain

3628.8 --> 3637.3900000000003
behavioral or metabolic aspects like

3633.4 --> 3640.2400000000002
start missing and then if the original

3637.39 --> 3642.64
blueprint is evaded from too far then it

3640.24 --> 3646.0
just no longer functions as a successful

3642.64 --> 3653.29
organism and it dies out and yeah

3646.0 --> 3656.95
species adapt so a people could live

3653.29 --> 3658.81
widely and then [ __ ] happens war happens

3656.95 --> 3660.85
and they'll be driven off and they'll

3658.81 --> 3663.97
maybe be forced to live in like a really

3660.85 --> 3668.44
hostile place but they will adapt and

3663.97 --> 3671.0499999999997
then over the the ages their physiology

3668.44 --> 3673.359
will actually adapt to that location

3671.05 --> 3676.619
making them slightly different with the

3673.359 --> 3679.96
same genetics but with other switches

3676.619 --> 3682.3
within them it's so fascinating how that

3679.96 --> 3686.369
works but that is not evolution that is

3682.3 --> 3691.3590000000004
adaption yeah and that same group can

3686.369 --> 3694.449
adapt back again if they want to if

3691.359 --> 3702.249
they're allowed to to move back

3694.449 --> 3704.9
it's fascinating how that works I'm 100%

3702.249 --> 3707.089
with you on that point

3704.9 --> 3712.039
adaptation is the thing it's fascinating

3707.089 --> 3714.439
was the week it's quick yeah it's really

3712.039 --> 3718.6400000000003
fast it can happen over just two or

3714.439 --> 3721.549
three generations and logical because

3718.64 --> 3725.15
yeah adaptation the faster you go the

3721.549 --> 3727.099
more survival opportunity so it would

3725.15 --> 3731.9
have to be fast if you're gonna adapt

3727.099 --> 3733.759
really slow it's not gonna cut it this

3731.9 --> 3736.219
is one of the biggest problem and where

3733.759 --> 3738.7690000000002
they have the stupid evolution thing is

3736.219 --> 3742.64
that let's say for a certain amount of

3738.769 --> 3744.799
time a species needs to hope but then

3742.64 --> 3750.819
there is a big Cataclysm and that

3744.799 --> 3754.7889999999998
species that species is not in any way

3750.819 --> 3757.64
capable of reaching let's say other land

3754.789 --> 3760.699
or other locations to fit so they die

3757.64 --> 3764.359
off so how can they evolve they die off

3760.699 --> 3766.849
in expect those long periods and those

3764.359 --> 3769.299
millions of years it's impossible to

3766.849 --> 3772.6090000000004
retain as a species for that long so

3769.299 --> 3776.299
adapt and evolve it's just ridiculous

3772.609 --> 3778.759
even think about it the old died out

3776.299 --> 3782.359
before they can evolve if evolution is

3778.759 --> 3788.209
ever possible which is not still it's

3782.359 --> 3794.0589999999997
just good sci-fi script evolution or

3788.209 --> 3796.5389999999998
movies but let's go on this yeah but

3794.059 --> 3801.079
then remains of course is like yeah

3796.539 --> 3803.179
where did it start or who is the creator

3801.079 --> 3806.779
when you go into the personification

3803.179 --> 3810.049
mode like who is the creator or how or

3806.779 --> 3813.679
if there's not just a outside thing that

3810.049 --> 3818.39
did like make the designs then how did

3813.679 --> 3822.77
it come into being the way it did

3818.39 --> 3825.98
and that's just like what that's why

3822.77 --> 3827.99
that's why I shared this water rustle

3825.98 --> 3831.23
video with you because this is the main

3827.99 --> 3833.6899999999996
subject is about how it all started and

3831.23 --> 3837.31
it really has to do with what he

3833.69 --> 3840.32
described and I was researching and

3837.31 --> 3841.73
translating viktor schauberger powerful

3840.32 --> 3844.04
for my father

3841.73 --> 3846.86
cuz he's into the he's more into the

3844.04 --> 3849.77
free energy stuff so I was translating a

3846.86 --> 3852.29
book written by an Australian guy about

3849.77 --> 3854.84
the word viktor schauberger in minutes

3852.29 --> 3857.21
same stuff that water rose was talking

3854.84 --> 3860.03
about and it's really interesting and i

3857.21 --> 3862.4
have it on my computer I send it to you

3860.03 --> 3867.59
and I have the whole book in a PDF tao

3862.4 --> 3869.6
and i read just like the first maybe 20

3867.59 --> 3871.9100000000003
to 30 pages and I've learned so much

3869.6 --> 3875.87
stuff and actually understood so many

3871.91 --> 3880.3399999999997
stuff that I could never dreamed of

3875.87 --> 3883.7
understanding and just amazing you you

3880.34 --> 3885.6200000000003
have it in a PDF file you say yeah yeah

3883.7 --> 3889.52
well we would yeah I'm not much for

3885.62 --> 3892.6
books but sometimes I huh the only three

3889.52 --> 3895.72
long is just the descriptions that

3892.6 --> 3899.27
viktor schauberger that when he was

3895.72 --> 3901.6699999999996
observing natural phenomena to be clear

3899.27 --> 3905.5099999999998
about it first of all when to observe

3901.67 --> 3907.82
natural phenomena before actually you

3905.51 --> 3910.7900000000004
know missing a few steps in a very

3907.82 --> 3912.92
important piece of doing experiments

3910.79 --> 3917.72
with certain people around the flat

3912.92 --> 3921.62
plain look like this science i joke the

3917.72 --> 3926.87
bull art just an experiment so they

3921.62 --> 3928.3399999999997
tremble when they hear that and viktor

3926.87 --> 3931.46
schauberger actually made the

3928.34 --> 3934.4900000000002
observations hughes thing like four

3931.46 --> 3937.01
hours an hour just watching ponds and

3934.49 --> 3940.1
rivers in the mountain how they flow and

3937.01 --> 3942.2900000000004
to just start being carried out in his

3940.1 --> 3946.7
mind and started writing this stuff down

3942.29 --> 3951.34
and he started visually imagining how it

3946.7 --> 3958.27
all works and when you go and he raped

3951.34 --> 3961.6000000000004
what'd he look like absurd or as you say

3958.27 --> 3964.48
when you write from something or deduced

3961.6 --> 3966.58
he did use the elements from the model

3964.48 --> 3969.27
he tried to simulate of it all in his

3966.58 --> 3971.65
mind he try to simulate a

3969.27 --> 3975.97
reverse-engineer conceptualization of

3971.65 --> 3977.9500000000003
how it all works this heavy stuff and

3975.97 --> 3981.1
I'd have to do it myself

3977.95 --> 3982.93
yeah he was actually tracking back

3981.1 --> 3985.12
engineer nature because he figured

3982.93 --> 3987.58
that's the only way you can ever have

3985.12 --> 3990.0699999999997
real technologies actually looking for

3987.58 --> 3992.74
nature is them going because nature and

3990.07 --> 3996.51
Sun it's a technology it's nothing else

3992.74 --> 3999.22
a life isn't technology to be honest

3996.51 --> 4002.82
although I don't like particularly that

3999.22 --> 4006.29
term but that's true we cannot just

4002.82 --> 4009.1200000000003
thought technically it is yeah

4006.29 --> 4012.3
technically but there's just so much

4009.12 --> 4014.6099999999997
more to it it's not just technology

4012.3 --> 4019.4300000000003
we're not biological machines and that's

4014.61 --> 4024.96
it no no no we are connected there's

4019.43 --> 4029.31
like trans-time influences and it's just

4024.96 --> 4031.91
life it's not just a basic technology it

4029.31 --> 4034.5
is the most complex most advanced

4031.91 --> 4037.95
technology that we will never fully

4034.5 --> 4041.18
understand yeah and it's like the visual

4037.95 --> 4043.71
Specter white that this is like zeroes

4041.18 --> 4048.7799999999997
0.06 a column of visible light so

4043.71 --> 4050.55
imagine for the amount of stuff that's

4048.78 --> 4052.6200000000003
going on around us but we cannot

4050.55 --> 4055.2000000000003
comprehend because our eyes were made

4052.62 --> 4059.19
specifically for where that that

4055.2 --> 4062.18
percentage so they can actually our eyes

4059.19 --> 4065.1
and brain system that create reality by

4062.18 --> 4068.24
encoding reality in our heads yeah

4065.1 --> 4071.85
they're adapted or designed for or both

4068.24 --> 4075.2
to what is relevant to beings of our

4071.85 --> 4077.67
type to give us access to the fields of

4075.2 --> 4079.06
reality that we can actually do

4077.67 --> 4081.23
something with

4079.06 --> 4083.5099999999998
because why would you need to see

4081.23 --> 4087.26
something that that has no meaning to

4083.51 --> 4090.19
you yeah and then your psychology and I

4087.26 --> 4095.9900000000002
knew God you realize oh [ __ ] that's

4090.19 --> 4099.04
there as well it's just the amounts of

4095.99 --> 4103.04
information than the hours of I'm going

4099.04 --> 4105.65
thinking about it it's just astonishing

4103.04 --> 4109.13
but I love actually being carried out on

4105.65 --> 4111.95
this subject because actually it's like

4109.13 --> 4115.85
that third debate yeah I love that I

4111.95 --> 4119.3589999999995
mean but then it's so part of life how

4115.85 --> 4121.58
can take stuff out of life and just

4119.359 --> 4124.700000000001
speak about one puppet all the time it's

4121.58 --> 4126.859
it's part of life it's why you need to

4124.7 --> 4130.58
speak for it because the more change

4126.859 --> 4132.35
life with it so we have to mention all

4130.58 --> 4134.8099999999995
the other stuff from time to time it's

4132.35 --> 4138.83
working we are it's a learning process

4134.81 --> 4141.950000000001
it's Nick you know that's an example if

4138.83 --> 4144.589
you'd have a kid like a little kid and

4141.95 --> 4147.139999999999
they're like fooling around and playing

4144.589 --> 4149.0599999999995
with their fantasy things you're not

4147.14 --> 4152.27
gonna like that's that's all a lie

4149.06 --> 4155.950000000001
that's a lie you can't do that you you

4152.27 --> 4158.6900000000005
gotta let them do their thing and then

4155.95 --> 4161.24
figure it out slowly and you might even

4158.69 --> 4165.169999999999
help them with it with with the things

4161.24 --> 4167.089
that they deal with in their minds can't

4165.17 --> 4170.299
just punish them because you know it's

4167.089 --> 4173.9
wrong yeah it kind of falls back to the

4170.299 --> 4176.99
same concept is you gotta let people

4173.9 --> 4179.83
make their mistakes yeah worse because

4176.99 --> 4181.389999999999
if you take that away from them then

4179.83 --> 4185.75
what it is

4181.39 --> 4191.75
well no just fail completely you don't

4185.75 --> 4193.819
make mistakes right the learning right

4191.75 --> 4196.94
but yeah in another way

4193.819 --> 4198.89
look it's these ballers even though they

4196.94 --> 4202.94
behave absolutely juvenile and like

4198.89 --> 4205.29
idiot kids some of them you can't punish

4202.94 --> 4207.69
them for believing and

4205.29 --> 4210.0
that is starting to become kind of a

4207.69 --> 4213.87
thing that's gradually getting accepted

4210.0 --> 4217.53
it's the bad behavior and the knowing

4213.87 --> 4220.32
deception the evil that they use the

4217.53 --> 4223.17
hold on that's the bad part

4220.32 --> 4226.2
yeah they have certainly most of them

4223.17 --> 4228.21
they have an agenda I think I will

4226.2 --> 4230.16
assume our private conversation to help

4228.21 --> 4233.85
reporters know that I've listened to the

4230.16 --> 4237.21
past three months of Nathan's show with

4233.85 --> 4240.240000000001
you and Anthony and Nathan having all

4237.21 --> 4243.15
these discussions and it seems like some

4240.24 --> 4245.37
of them you can see a pattern if you

4243.15 --> 4247.799999999999
listen to all of it for like that short

4245.37 --> 4252.0
amount thank you can see a pattern yeah

4247.8 --> 4254.76
it's it's like the strategy just you

4252.0 --> 4257.22
know get everybody distracted and

4254.76 --> 4259.2
getting this pessimist specific topic

4257.22 --> 4261.93
they're not actually aligned for

4259.2 --> 4267.05
allowing for that say normal people that

4261.93 --> 4270.360000000001
may or will understand what's being

4267.05 --> 4273.06
shown to them or discussed with them

4270.36 --> 4276.24
they just seem to want to block it and

4273.06 --> 4278.21
have it in their own small you know it's

4276.24 --> 4280.74
like putting a leash on it and just

4278.21 --> 4283.92
pulling it into a certain direction like

4280.74 --> 4286.469999999999
although right they just want more room

4283.92 --> 4288.87
for their dream it's merely the

4286.47 --> 4293.34
beginning it's they really don't care

4288.87 --> 4296.67
about that about what's out there that

4293.34 --> 4299.52
doesn't make it work any more in the way

4296.67 --> 4302.85
they want it like they really want it to

4299.52 --> 4305.55
be the truth the more true of the

4302.85 --> 4307.8
foundation and it doesn't really work so

4305.55 --> 4310.68
they will then fight off everything that

4307.8 --> 4316.16
suggests the contrary they will just

4310.68 --> 4319.62
dismiss it outright and just make room

4316.16 --> 4321.99
builds castle walls around it off

4319.62 --> 4325.74
devious deception techniques and red

4321.99 --> 4328.88
herrings to keep that container within

4325.74 --> 4330.71
safe where they can just play with

4328.88 --> 4335.179
dream and try to build that dream castle

4330.71 --> 4337.34
up it's a fascinating yeah they're

4335.179 --> 4339.679
they're always looking outwards it's

4337.34 --> 4342.38
like people like us like you spell that

4339.679 --> 4350.15
movies business part of it or more of it

4342.38 --> 4353.57
it's looking inwards yes very well isn't

4350.15 --> 4356.75
that even a an ancient philosophical

4353.57 --> 4360.049999999999
truth that reflects among the wisest in

4356.75 --> 4363.59
the religions is that if you're gonna

4360.05 --> 4366.7390000000005
look for the truth or knowledge you have

4363.59 --> 4369.88
to look inside yeah you can only find it

4366.739 --> 4373.489
inside you can't find it out there yeah

4369.88 --> 4375.56
that's what it comes down to and it's

4373.489 --> 4378.44
like I'm sorry if I'm interrupting

4375.56 --> 4381.650000000001
something but good point

4378.44 --> 4383.178999999999
oh not in my mind it's like let's say

4381.65 --> 4386.2699999999995
for example because skin words

4383.179 --> 4389.929
everything has the information contained

4386.27 --> 4392.6900000000005
into it so let's say for example the

4389.929 --> 4395.4800000000005
quality of buoyancy top quality of the

4392.69 --> 4397.339999999999
ship its quality of the object of the

4395.48 --> 4399.83
water sorry

4397.34 --> 4403.1900000000005
it doesn't ship that has the bones its

4399.83 --> 4409.3099999999995
water that can provide the ship to use

4403.19 --> 4414.65
buoyancy and it's like for example water

4409.31 --> 4417.71
being like you know under under under

4414.65 --> 4421.009999999999
ground currents or underground flows of

4417.71 --> 4425.3
water and they raise up where the soil

4421.01 --> 4427.1900000000005
is hydroscopic so it's not actually a

4425.3 --> 4429.7390000000005
quality of the soul it's both of the

4427.19 --> 4432.589999999999
water to climb up so how does it require

4429.739 --> 4438.138999999999
movements gravity that's how yes higher

4432.59 --> 4440.4490000000005
that's unique workings of the Keppler

4438.139 --> 4442.639
working I think it's maybe that's too

4440.449 --> 4446.36
specific but it is the unique ability

4442.639 --> 4449.3
for water and liquids of all kinds to

4446.36 --> 4451.549999999999
really worm themselves through tiny

4449.3 --> 4453.570000000001
spaces and the more tiny the space is

4451.55 --> 4456.4800000000005
the more attractive it will

4453.57 --> 4458.88
and the liquid to insert themselves into

4456.48 --> 4460.619
and it is actually like a miniature

4458.88 --> 4463.26
force yeah

4460.619 --> 4466.17
and if insiders know we're into to the

4463.26 --> 4469.889
structure it's fascinating

4466.17 --> 4472.1990000000005
I learn about this stuff in my yeah in

4469.889 --> 4474.21
my years as a goldsmith you learn about

4472.199 --> 4477.719
how that works and you actually have to

4474.21 --> 4480.27
use that effect to your advantage as you

4477.719 --> 4482.7300000000005
design stuff like how are you going to

4480.27 --> 4486.9890000000005
solder these pieces together you do it

4482.73 --> 4489.2699999999995
by making the seam as seamless as

4486.989 --> 4492.8099999999995
possible and if you do that it's very

4489.27 --> 4495.869000000001
close and close enough then you put the

4492.81 --> 4498.9890000000005
solder just at one spot you liquefy it

4495.869 --> 4501.96
and then it shoots up because of the

4498.989 --> 4502.678999999999
capital are working now huh oh that's

4501.96 --> 4504.96
really interesting

4502.679 --> 4508.889
how do you know that yeah it's magic

4504.96 --> 4510.36
it's the magic of matter it's a line

4508.889 --> 4513.659000000001
it's everywhere that kind of I think

4510.36 --> 4517.679
it's also part of even how trees suck up

4513.659 --> 4520.138999999999
the water out of the ground well I think

4517.679 --> 4523.8
I think there's like a pump going on I

4520.139 --> 4527.579
think it's just the space is made for it

4523.8 --> 4530.7300000000005
to naturally draw itself upwards I think

4527.579 --> 4532.889
it's just right and so I think group

4530.73 --> 4535.79
again Island yourself I'll forget it I

4532.889 --> 4539.400000000001
get this is destructive really sorry

4535.79 --> 4542.13
it's what it's described in in viktor

4539.4 --> 4544.53
schauberger x' work and actually parts

4542.13 --> 4546.54
and the water rustles that actually but

4544.53 --> 4549.36
mainly in viktor schauberger now semi

4546.54 --> 4551.699
you know we can do another show some

4549.36 --> 4556.259999999999
time to talk specifically about that

4551.699 --> 4559.949
about water but then it's a when for

4556.26 --> 4562.860000000001
example something is about to occur it's

4559.949 --> 4565.44
only to do with the differences in

4562.86 --> 4567.449
temperatures of the different layers in

4565.44 --> 4569.759999999999
water this is what causes movement and

4567.449 --> 4575.549999999999
actually flow of water it's very well

4569.76 --> 4577.860000000001
discharges yeah well in different layers

4575.55 --> 4579.75
of water when they change temperature

4577.86 --> 4583.619
they actually that missus well produces

4579.75 --> 4586.29
the motion and it's for example trees

4583.619 --> 4587.369
they they're just the information that

4586.29 --> 4594.449
it's calling trees

4587.369 --> 4596.848999999999
oh they'll create a certain and I forgot

4594.449 --> 4599.339999999999
the English what about that it's really

4596.849 --> 4601.6990000000005
nice this is very specific order I'm

4599.34 --> 4604.619000000001
sorry

4601.699 --> 4606.089999999999
when when you'll do something and you

4604.619 --> 4608.61
want to happen a certain way and you

4606.09 --> 4610.29
create everything for it about to happen

4608.61 --> 4621.8099999999995
that specific way how will you spread

4610.29 --> 4625.28
that not free it's pretty simple oh just

4621.81 --> 4627.17
going a little bit translated story

4625.28 --> 4638.429
[Music]

4627.17 --> 4639.9890000000005
prescient know so many pre words just

4638.429 --> 4646.099
take your time don't worry the

4639.989 --> 4649.53
prerequisite up so the tree knows how to

4646.099 --> 4651.659000000001
create a prerequisite for the water to

4649.53 --> 4653.96
use so it's not actually the tree

4651.659 --> 4656.67
pumping the water up is actually tree

4653.96 --> 4661.679
creating this and knowing that water

4656.67 --> 4663.9
will on its own start climbing oh yeah

4661.679 --> 4666.6900000000005
well that's funny because that's kind of

4663.9 --> 4668.909
what I described earlier it so well

4666.69 --> 4671.638999999999
maybe we're not most in translation or

4668.909 --> 4674.67
terms no I just described it from

4671.639 --> 4679.02
another angle you but that's yeah you're

4674.67 --> 4682.1990000000005
right that that is a thing tree doesn't

4679.02 --> 4687.119000000001
mechanically do a lot it just uses the

4682.199 --> 4691.469
natural effect of water and apply it the

4687.119 --> 4693.659
most efficient in its system because you

4691.469 --> 4696.869
know that you can get a piece of tissue

4693.659 --> 4699.0
and put one side of it into water and

4696.869 --> 4700.71
then the other side into a container

4699.0 --> 4705.51
that's higher up and it will start to

4700.71 --> 4708.4800000000005
fill because of the its hygroscopic but

4705.51 --> 4710.219
that's actually the water quality that's

4708.48 --> 4712.98
doing it it's not the tissue because

4710.219 --> 4715.2300000000005
issue is not a light thing it maybe was

4712.98 --> 4719.66
a tree but now it's a paper tissue and

4715.23 --> 4722.419999999999
it's dead so we doesn't have no

4719.66 --> 4725.96
no electric charges that a tree house or

4722.42 --> 4731.05
the know the bio forces that I treat us

4725.96 --> 4733.85
but it has to high grow idris copy fiber

4731.05 --> 4736.64
elements still to it yeah and that is

4733.85 --> 4739.070000000001
what the that is what actually is

4736.64 --> 4741.58
derived about it from the trees because

4739.07 --> 4744.44
they're matter has that ability

4741.58 --> 4748.58
naturally and we're basically using that

4744.44 --> 4751.849999999999
ability to then make paper of it that

4748.58 --> 4755.09
can do that absorb things quickly be

4751.85 --> 4759.02
hydroscopic mmm but it's a natural

4755.09 --> 4761.81
ability to those fibers that allow that

4759.02 --> 4763.6
if you can do it too with plastic yeah

4761.81 --> 4766.580000000001
that's not gonna work okay

4763.6 --> 4768.620000000001
cloths not gonna do that

4766.58 --> 4771.5599999999995
yes a certain type of clothes will

4768.62 --> 4774.88
bullet actually is well yeah but not

4771.56 --> 4777.71
plastic really no plastic is hydrophobic

4774.88 --> 4781.85
plastic and metal Sam yeah not there of

4777.71 --> 4783.56
course there's other like the other

4781.85 --> 4786.950000000001
plant-based fabrics

4783.56 --> 4792.29
yeah and all that that also have

4786.95 --> 4800.48
hygroscopic or any more for days fabric

4792.29 --> 4802.79
also good that's tough cuz many animal

4800.48 --> 4805.16
based fabrics are actually hydrophobic

4802.79 --> 4809.33
naturally especially if they're hairs or

4805.16 --> 4811.55
skin because it's meant to keep out you

4809.33 --> 4815.99
have there are sites in it and

4811.55 --> 4819.110000000001
everything or I'm just I think there

4815.99 --> 4822.11
were some I remember God seeing

4819.11 --> 4824.089999999999
something about or maybe they were

4822.11 --> 4828.65
treated in a certain way right may be

4824.09 --> 4831.05
mistaken but but then the the thing is

4828.65 --> 4833.21
that it fascinates me the most is when

4831.05 --> 4837.4400000000005
he'll when I speak with other people

4833.21 --> 4843.28
Barbie they think that it's actually the

4837.44 --> 4845.66
the the not the solids that are actually

4843.28 --> 4849.91
extracting the water is actually water

4845.66 --> 4849.91
on its own going up on solids

4850.719 --> 4858.82
yeah yeah that's the there's no amazing

4855.88 --> 4860.9490000000005
part of working that yeah that's all I I

4858.82 --> 4864.63
don't even I don't I know the Dutch

4860.949 --> 4864.629999999999
terminology let's just see

4871.099 --> 4876.899
mmm doesn't seem to understand the word

4875.51 --> 4880.289000000001
where is it

4876.899 --> 4882.149
capillary action yeah yeah it's

4880.289 --> 4887.249
capillary action that's the right word

4882.149 --> 4892.859
for it post the link in chet people to

4887.249 --> 4896.449
see ya in dutch we call it the copy

4892.859 --> 4900.329000000001
layer very keen and apparently

4896.449 --> 4903.629
yeah it's called capillary action yeah

4900.329 --> 4906.119
yeah that's right i watch the ball

4903.629 --> 4908.929
fluids the other day like surface

4906.119 --> 4911.098999999999
tension is what actually positive

4908.929 --> 4913.589
because you know the meniscus on the

4911.099 --> 4917.839
sides and it's like grabbing with its

4913.589 --> 4917.839
own hands and started starting to climb

4918.799 --> 4922.229
yeah

4919.979 --> 4924.329000000001
it was a really interesting video but

4922.229 --> 4927.629
like i don't like i'm not able to find

4924.329 --> 4931.289
it now it's uh it's like very small

4927.629 --> 4934.829
piece of wood that it's been carved into

4931.289 --> 4939.509999999999
a screw and they put it inside a bucket

4934.829 --> 4942.329
of water and they start pouring water on

4939.51 --> 4944.939
top of it it's lying down flat on the

4942.329 --> 4948.3589999999995
surface of water it's being buoyant it's

4944.939 --> 4950.609
wood and soap and then when it's when

4948.359 --> 4953.249000000001
the other water starts going on top of

4950.609 --> 4957.209000000001
it actually starts spinning then turns

4953.249 --> 4960.148999999999
vertically and then starts climbing the

4957.209 --> 4963.03
water that's being pulling down directly

4960.149 --> 4966.929
climbs up oh you got video I gotta see

4963.03 --> 4971.759999999999
that it's this is how you know trout the

4966.929 --> 4974.249
fish trout that's actually jumping up

4971.76 --> 4976.979
the streams well fish is actually

4974.249 --> 4978.419
actually not doing anything water does

4976.979 --> 4980.819
everything for the fish

4978.419 --> 4983.159
you just have to move their tail

4980.819 --> 4985.379000000001
slightly left and right and that's it

4983.159 --> 4987.1089999999995
they don't need to put any effort but

4985.379 --> 4992.429
everything else is done by the water

4987.109 --> 4994.169000000001
we're like almost propelled as if well

4992.429 --> 4998.249
by actually at pushing off another

4994.169 --> 5001.099
magnet that type well well actually it's

4998.249 --> 5004.46
very easy I can explain it it's you know

5001.099 --> 5005.900000000001
their their back fin creates

5004.46 --> 5008.06
movement to the left to the right so

5005.9 --> 5010.219
water's being pushed left and right and

5008.06 --> 5012.7390000000005
then the skills are actually doing the

5010.219 --> 5015.14
big part the skills around their body so

5012.739 --> 5017.8099999999995
you know they have smaller skills next

5015.14 --> 5021.02
to the back in the tail and then a

5017.81 --> 5023.3
bigger scale next to to their gills

5021.02 --> 5026.660000000001
where they breathe and they expel the

5023.3 --> 5029.0
water without the oxygen so starting

5026.66 --> 5034.5199999999995
with the small ones date between each

5029.0 --> 5036.32
scale is small vortex created and it

5034.52 --> 5039.17
it's a Pyrrhic is it to create the

5036.32 --> 5041.96
bigger vortex on the next bigger scale

5039.17 --> 5045.5
and in front of the fish actually what's

5041.96 --> 5047.51
generated at the end on the left in the

5045.5 --> 5049.969
right side of his head is just one

5047.51 --> 5051.8
vortex and another vortex and it's

5049.969 --> 5053.69
actually like a tornado and if you get

5051.8 --> 5057.320000000001
too close to a tornado it sucks you in

5053.69 --> 5058.94
and just fish just know how to when you

5057.32 --> 5061.79
put behind the water in front of them

5058.94 --> 5063.469
and then just water sucking them here

5061.79 --> 5065.9
doesn't actually propel itself at all

5063.469 --> 5067.969
they don't swim that's crazy

5065.9 --> 5071.78
you just blew my mind that's just like

5067.969 --> 5074.87
as crazy as why the bumblebee fleas so

5071.78 --> 5077.2699999999995
there's pictures they're using under

5074.87 --> 5079.34
static properties like it's super high

5077.27 --> 5082.7300000000005
tech and it's just part of these

5079.34 --> 5085.96
creatures it's just amazing and that's

5082.73 --> 5089.718999999999
that's all fish is good

5085.96 --> 5092.33
it's not just trout jumping up on the

5089.719 --> 5093.83
springs is just all fish know that this

5092.33 --> 5096.0199999999995
is the way they swim they know it for

5093.83 --> 5099.62
themselves they can tell it with their

5096.02 --> 5103.4800000000005
bodies that when they you know they will

5099.62 --> 5107.51
move their head like this and they'll

5103.48 --> 5109.25
waggle the tail this is because the head

5107.51 --> 5110.84
head moves to left into the right

5109.25 --> 5112.63
because they're trying to stay close

5110.84 --> 5115.610000000001
with were things that they've created

5112.63 --> 5117.62
they're doing a dance with the forces

5115.61 --> 5123.08
basically hold the board is actually one

5117.62 --> 5125.12
easier that's the pulling force by the

5123.08 --> 5128.84
way Thank You Daniel field for the super

5125.12 --> 5133.099999999999
chat donation but just really do my mind

5128.84 --> 5134.9490000000005
is like I had some kind of suspicion

5133.1 --> 5137.7390000000005
there so there was something

5134.949 --> 5140.409
to it there's something there but that

5137.739 --> 5144.249
that's actually been figured out that is

5140.409 --> 5146.829
Wow and and that that was figuring out

5144.249 --> 5151.239
like a long long time ago

5146.829 --> 5154.119
of course when I'm able to find the

5151.239 --> 5156.579
video with the wooden scrutiny I'll send

5154.119 --> 5158.38
it to a minute it's I've tried to find

5156.579 --> 5161.549999999999
it now but it's so many of them it's

5158.38 --> 5163.1990000000005
like he'll take me ages and then

5161.55 --> 5166.869000000001
everybody

5163.199 --> 5171.518999999999
subscribe to our ones channel like but

5166.869 --> 5174.098999999999
for sure to show donate thank you thank

5171.519 --> 5177.459
you yeah indeed also Karen B was

5174.099 --> 5180.28
interested in Who am I talking to

5177.459 --> 5182.38
so maybe you could post something in the

5180.28 --> 5186.099
chat so they can actually link to your

5182.38 --> 5188.32
channel that's no I think you got the

5186.099 --> 5194.17
attention of some people that's my

5188.32 --> 5198.34
official name so and just fine yeah but

5194.17 --> 5200.65
the chats completely full so if you

5198.34 --> 5204.219
could comment again just say hello or

5200.65 --> 5211.478999999999
whatever in the in the actual YouTube

5204.219 --> 5214.05
chat channel my channel that there is no

5211.479 --> 5218.9400000000005
my channel it just might

5214.05 --> 5221.889
I'm I don't know what I don't know what

5218.94 --> 5225.4
stuff I just I pointed out to people

5221.889 --> 5228.55
like you and like Nathan so they're much

5225.4 --> 5230.32
more in do some feather stuff alright

5228.55 --> 5233.139
okay I just got the point before into

5230.32 --> 5234.4
the right direction in this well they're

5233.139 --> 5237.959
smarter than me and they keep going

5234.4 --> 5240.789
further away that I can I just points oh

5237.959 --> 5247.949
well you know what I'll do it another

5240.789 --> 5247.949
way I'll just put you

5247.969 --> 5256.31
then Georgia

5252.86 --> 5259.5199999999995
Dejan George F I just look you it

5256.31 --> 5261.9490000000005
sorry it's little rusty

5259.52 --> 5266.81
I'll put you in the early bird chat

5261.949 --> 5269.989
Karen B is also in there and yeah you

5266.81 --> 5272.4800000000005
can post stuff in there as well if

5269.989 --> 5275.599999999999
they're foreign cultures what do people

5272.48 --> 5278.9
watch an award well they're interested

5275.6 --> 5281.719
in talking to you obviously all right so

5278.9 --> 5283.94
I added you in the skype group Karen B

5281.719 --> 5287.27
is also there so you can just say hello

5283.94 --> 5290.239
alright alright or at your own time

5287.27 --> 5295.43
don't worry about its no haste but yeah

5290.239 --> 5299.03
do you got the attention you really know

5295.43 --> 5303.92
some good stuff you know well nature is

5299.03 --> 5307.36
amazing and there's so much more that we

5303.92 --> 5310.85
can actually use to improve industry

5307.36 --> 5313.699
that's one of my personal missions even

5310.85 --> 5316.910000000001
well well I think implied nature to just

5313.699 --> 5319.129999999999
fix this world I think they've already

5316.91 --> 5320.75
done it but we just don't know I think

5319.13 --> 5324.64
they're they're doing it for the past

5320.75 --> 5330.35
it's donal years how jesus well maybe

5324.64 --> 5333.29
what I want to do myself oh and I got my

5330.35 --> 5337.25
plan so I thought of things that kind of

5333.29 --> 5340.04
fall into this type of category like how

5337.25 --> 5345.46
could we more efficiently filter water

5340.04 --> 5349.91
without expanding oh yeah without

5345.46 --> 5352.13
expanding raw materials just using and

5349.91 --> 5354.98
my idea was was very it's kind of

5352.13 --> 5357.89
primitive idea but like what if we would

5354.98 --> 5361.25
study how kidneys work and how they

5357.89 --> 5364.34
actually manage to filter out specific

5361.25 --> 5366.199
type of toxins how does that work and if

5364.34 --> 5369.71
we could back engineer that we might be

5366.199 --> 5371.679999999999
able to build just mechanical artificial

5369.71 --> 5374.33
kidneys that we could for example

5371.68 --> 5376.64
install in rivers

5374.33 --> 5379.79
and don't just have automatic water

5376.64 --> 5383.4800000000005
filters so all the junk could be taken

5379.79 --> 5386.51
out and we could reuse it again for a

5383.48 --> 5389.929999999999
fishery and all that that kind of just

5386.51 --> 5392.27
net innate your application to make

5389.93 --> 5395.72
everything better but that's just one of

5392.27 --> 5397.9400000000005
my concepts that yeah it's very close to

5395.72 --> 5402.05
my heart and I'm still looking into that

5397.94 --> 5403.49
kind of stuff a lot anyway well you're

5402.05 --> 5405.71
on the right point and that's that's

5403.49 --> 5407.389999999999
also covered in the in the book that I

5405.71 --> 5409.28
just found it out and I'll send it to

5407.39 --> 5413.84
you in the PDF

5409.28 --> 5416.78
I'm putting put into Skype now I put it

5413.84 --> 5419.02
in the the group so everybody can get

5416.78 --> 5422.509999999999
ahold of it

5419.02 --> 5428.96
yeah I also post your video today to

5422.51 --> 5429.320000000001
Walter Russell in there and also oh all

5428.96 --> 5433.55
right

5429.32 --> 5437.45
and then if it's consumed it's in the

5433.55 --> 5441.68
book how shall Berger describes how you

5437.45 --> 5444.679999999999
require water it's like so easy you know

5441.68 --> 5448.610000000001
John I remember that name from that's a

5444.68 --> 5452.83
long time I thought my mother knew about

5448.61 --> 5455.66
that like 30 years ago

5452.83 --> 5458.84
well viktor schauberger yeah

5455.66 --> 5462.23
yeah I assisted distinctly remember the

5458.84 --> 5464.87
name but well yeah I was still in my

5462.23 --> 5473.48
whole space thingies and transformers

5464.87 --> 5478.12
and [ __ ] lemurs don't hate on new people

5473.48 --> 5484.58
I just sort of all their space right

5478.12 --> 5488.42
Cybertron yeah I mean it's a it's a good

5484.58 --> 5491.2699999999995
exercise for the eye there's another

5488.42 --> 5494.2300000000005
term for it but I won't say it is it's

5491.27 --> 5494.2300000000005
inappropriate okay

5495.14 --> 5499.12
yeah fuchsia

5501.09 --> 5507.21
man we've been going for one half hour

5504.449 --> 5510.48
and I don't think nathan is doing a flat

5507.21 --> 5512.67
earth debates just a rerun I was just

5510.48 --> 5515.759999999999
about to ask we know it he's doing

5512.67 --> 5520.65
anything no is no idea what he's doing

5515.76 --> 5523.02
it usually starts right an hour after I

5520.65 --> 5526.5
start the show that was the kind of the

5523.02 --> 5529.079000000001
original plan mm-hmm how we set it up

5526.5 --> 5530.82
like yeah I'll do it and show the early

5529.079 --> 5532.739
bird show one hour before the debates

5530.82 --> 5536.13
that's how it started and we stuck with

5532.739 --> 5538.888999999999
that sort of but yeah because of all the

5536.13 --> 5542.88
intensity and his family and a new kid

5538.889 --> 5544.92
coming probably he's decided to take the

5542.88 --> 5548.7300000000005
weekends off and only do restream

5544.92 --> 5551.88
premieres so he can get some of his life

5548.73 --> 5553.829
back yeah it's probably better because

5551.88 --> 5557.55
yeah since he started doing that last

5553.829 --> 5560.369
week he's been much more on top of

5557.55 --> 5563.1900000000005
things and more energy because yeah you

5560.369 --> 5565.199
need a break when you go that's all the

5563.19 --> 5569.4
time you know so I think it's a good

5565.199 --> 5573.058999999999
decision a pragmatic decision but yeah

5569.4 --> 5576.989
no debates in the weekends although I'm

5573.059 --> 5580.25
not sure if there was if it was there

5576.989 --> 5583.259999999999
then it was late very unusual time and

5580.25 --> 5586.02
yeah I think it was I think it was usual

5583.26 --> 5588.360000000001
time I don't know what he's gonna do

5586.02 --> 5591.719
maybe we'll do that again today I have a

5588.36 --> 5595.199
late debate or maybe just not but he

5591.719 --> 5603.57
will definitely be back tomorrow well if

5595.199 --> 5607.65
there's not I'm not able to get right to

5603.57 --> 5611.73
today how I'll just open it tomorrow I'm

5607.65 --> 5613.259999999999
able to so some of the issue I mean

5611.73 --> 5617.098999999999
we're in touch now so it's much easier

5613.26 --> 5622.559
than trying to get a hold of some of you

5617.099 --> 5625.38
guys it took me some time like so and

5622.559 --> 5627.389
the thing is that I just used messenger

5625.38 --> 5629.400000000001
and Facebook and apparently nobody's

5627.389 --> 5632.099
using it that much I haven't used Skype

5629.4 --> 5633.7699999999995
in like seven or eight years since

5632.099 --> 5637.38
yesterday

5633.77 --> 5641.030000000001
mmm in it it was a bit confusing with

5637.38 --> 5647.27
all the hangouts thing I didn't work so

5641.03 --> 5650.55
that took me some figuring out all right

5647.27 --> 5653.790000000001
well yeah you're in there now and yeah a

5650.55 --> 5656.13
lot of flat earthers most of the debate

5653.79 --> 5657.69
crew we have been using Skype for a long

5656.13 --> 5660.6900000000005
time it's always been a great platform

5657.69 --> 5664.259999999999
to stay in touch all these different

5660.69 --> 5665.969999999999
rooms and people bring up new videos or

5664.26 --> 5670.530000000001
like oh look there's livestream here

5665.97 --> 5674.34
right now and yeah it's been a very good

5670.53 --> 5678.9
platform to us or to me at least I'm

5674.34 --> 5681.4800000000005
very satisfied with Skype I used to be

5678.9 --> 5684.179999999999
technical problems though like a year

5681.48 --> 5687.599999999999
ago but everything seems to be smoothing

5684.18 --> 5689.280000000001
out right now so it's good I haven't

5687.6 --> 5691.530000000001
been really up to date I've always liked

5689.28 --> 5693.87
that it's always been useful

5691.53 --> 5697.08
I just haven't used it no Facebook and

5693.87 --> 5702.72
messenger and just like stuff like that

5697.08 --> 5704.91
like viber like MSN Messenger that like

5702.72 --> 5708.990000000001
facebook Messenger actually Facebook

5704.91 --> 5710.849999999999
okay I don't know about that it's like a

5708.99 --> 5713.25
chat that you can have a messenger but

5710.85 --> 5716.7300000000005
in it phones like a separate app on your

5713.25 --> 5719.67
phone yeah it's like a chatting apple

5716.73 --> 5721.469999999999
yeah right yeah oh there's so many chat

5719.67 --> 5724.1900000000005
apps right there I don't think it's

5721.47 --> 5726.96
everywhere chat rooms is like the new

5724.19 --> 5729.54
medium you know we used to have text

5726.96 --> 5731.4
messages I still use that but now

5729.54 --> 5735.2699999999995
there's just chat rooms and you can get

5731.4 --> 5737.58
it on anything like before no time like

5735.27 --> 5742.02
even standard basic calculators we'll

5737.58 --> 5746.4
have chat rooms because everybody does

5742.02 --> 5748.4400000000005
it yeah yeah whatsapp exactly it's like

5746.4 --> 5752.129999999999
everybody in the Netherlands uses

5748.44 --> 5756.0
whatsapp it's just it's weird it's like

5752.13 --> 5757.5
oh like even my landlord uses what's app

5756.0 --> 5759.33
to communicate with

5757.5 --> 5763.68
with people that are living here like

5759.33 --> 5767.82
everybody uses that for work and I don't

5763.68 --> 5770.91
use it but I probably kind of should but

5767.82 --> 5775.29
it's almost like I don't want it I don't

5770.91 --> 5780.0599999999995
want it but now it's it's still a useful

5775.29 --> 5781.38
tool for communication yeah well it is

5780.06 --> 5782.820000000001
that was the same with the Viper I

5781.38 --> 5787.05
didn't want to use viber at the

5782.82 --> 5789.24
beginning of then I have to have big

5787.05 --> 5792.6
bigger with choice so I had well now I'm

5789.24 --> 5793.32
just kind of getting used to it - what

5792.6 --> 5796.620000000001
sorry

5793.32 --> 5801.24
it's a Viper it's if somebody has your

5796.62 --> 5804.15
phone number it goes and send you good

5801.24 --> 5806.7
you can chat with him and call him

5804.15 --> 5808.889999999999
like Skype could you just need the phone

5806.7 --> 5811.91
number instead of the name of the person

5808.89 --> 5817.56
other you're trying to reach

5811.91 --> 5819.51
okay that's new yeah so it's just if I

5817.56 --> 5821.76
have your phone number we can use it

5819.51 --> 5824.79
like on our phones to text and make

5821.76 --> 5827.6900000000005
video calls and all sorts oh of course

5824.79 --> 5832.98
over the internet without actually

5827.69 --> 5835.5599999999995
paying just a cup free yeah like the

5832.98 --> 5837.45
Skype call yeah yeah this is that it's

5835.56 --> 5839.85
actually the same you just use the phone

5837.45 --> 5842.91
number instead of the user's name or

5839.85 --> 5845.52
their is that we yeah but it is like

5842.91 --> 5847.32
exclusively found based then yeah yeah I

5845.52 --> 5848.64
gotta have internet on your phone or

5847.32 --> 5855.719999999999
something you can't do it on your

5848.64 --> 5859.02
desktop computer yeah yeah okay that's

5855.72 --> 5860.52
cool so I think I'm gonna round out the

5859.02 --> 5864.63
show now it's yeah we could probably

5860.52 --> 5866.790000000001
keep on going but no yeah Rachel I
