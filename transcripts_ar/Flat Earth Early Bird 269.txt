187.54 --> 193.45
be life but it wasn't then I didn't

189.58 --> 196.57000000000002
notice that it's just not been paying a

193.45 --> 199.38
lot of attention and I don't know I felt

196.57 --> 202.92
like oh why didn't they invite me again

199.38 --> 208.10999999999999
but it was just me not paying attention

202.92 --> 216.54
silly stuff hello ego playing anchor

208.11 --> 216.54000000000002
good to see you huh what else happened

218.35 --> 221.66899999999998
[Music]

229.28 --> 235.43
let me try to catch up I just been

232.64 --> 238.82
browsing a Roth I've just been browsing

235.43 --> 245.5
around with a lot of news channels that

238.82 --> 249.14
I look into like Artie and Infowars

245.5 --> 257.41
natural news but I don't know I've been

249.14 --> 257.40999999999997
dwelling a bit Oh God

269.96 --> 274.729
all right you really want me to address

272.33 --> 276.94
that right I haven't even seen it but I

274.729 --> 282.919
already know what that is because yeah

276.94 --> 288.44
right to head and Brenda it's bottom off

282.919 --> 292.84999999999997
the barrel stuff so yeah right the head

288.44 --> 295.82
is a total dick and he'll just stab with

292.85 --> 299.84000000000003
whatever weapon he sees without any kind

295.82 --> 302.509
of etiquette or anything he is maximum

299.84 --> 306.02
Sivan yay and yeah Brenda will of course

302.509 --> 307.72900000000004
get triggered by that but yeah if she

306.02 --> 312.289
wouldn't then it would just be stupid

307.729 --> 317.03
Brenda broken record player routine over

312.289 --> 324.15999999999997
and over so it's gonna yeah it wasn't

317.03 --> 328.48999999999995
gonna go anywhere anyway probably and I

324.16 --> 333.05
don't know it's it's [ __ ] showing and

328.49 --> 337.43
you could say oh this funny oh look yeah

333.05 --> 339.83
it draws a crowd but it's really a waste

337.43 --> 342.789
of time in my opinion and I like to

339.83 --> 342.789
avoid that [ __ ]

343.57 --> 353.539
yeah well reckoner Stefan Alderson

346.52 --> 357.44
why wouldn't I say it okay he treated me

353.539 --> 360.169
just awful

357.44 --> 363.889
I tried to have a conversation with him

360.169 --> 368.56
and he just went all aggressive for no

363.889 --> 372.59000000000003
reason with well I adhere on my show

368.56 --> 376.009
leaving these piles of really nasty or

372.59 --> 379.42999999999995
they attempting to be nasty messages to

376.009 --> 381.46000000000004
me and just in an obsessive manner so

379.43 --> 385.789
that is what he does he just attacks

381.46 --> 389.75
attacks everyone the guy is probably

385.789 --> 391.849
just permanently paranoid and he just

389.75 --> 393.8
tries to hold it back every time until

391.849 --> 397.659
something triggers him and then he just

393.8 --> 397.659
goes full-on attack everything

406.39 --> 409.579
[Music]

413.27 --> 422.15
I'm sure they did I don't know if that's

416.33 --> 424.31
true look super chats but Who am I

422.15 --> 426.289
kidding okay you guys know this [ __ ]

424.31 --> 430.25
what I'm just gonna tell you here and

426.289 --> 433.13
that is there is a concerted attempt

430.25 --> 436.43
from multiple angles from multiple

433.13 --> 440.18
sources within the youtuber community

436.43 --> 442.52
and from the funders of it and from

440.18 --> 447.58
probably YouTube itself and from all

442.52 --> 450.46999999999997
kinds of angles that are loving this

447.58 --> 452.599
this lack of cohesion within the Flat

450.47 --> 457.19000000000005
Earth community and they want nothing

452.599 --> 461.24
more than to convolute the [ __ ] out of

457.19 --> 463.849
it and turn it into a [ __ ] clown

461.24 --> 466.55
battle festival where everybody just

463.849 --> 469.069
shows their most disgusting demonic

466.55 --> 470.87
behavior at a constant basis so people

469.069 --> 473.96000000000004
don't get there for the information

470.87 --> 478.12
anymore no they get there to associate

473.96 --> 481.789
Flat Earth with antisocial mad people

478.12 --> 485.389
that are just behaving miserably and

481.789 --> 487.789
disgustingly to no end and to no purpose

485.389 --> 490.40000000000003
and that is why what they really want

487.789 --> 492.32
and that is I'm not saying that

490.4 --> 496.07
everybody that gives super chats or

492.32 --> 499.19
drops piles of money is in for that

496.07 --> 501.919
for example Sam heinous doesn't seem to

499.19 --> 505.009
be like that at all if you follow his

501.919 --> 506.419
money dropping behavior but I'll bet you

505.009 --> 508.69
there are some people out there that

506.419 --> 512.0889999999999
just love this [ __ ] they're literally

508.69 --> 514.7
your enemies with too much money they

512.089 --> 516.1690000000001
don't care about the money and they're

514.7 --> 518.36
just looking oh wow

516.169 --> 521.149
this guy is making a [ __ ] out of his

518.36 --> 523.61
show love it let's give him some money

521.149 --> 527.72
let's actually see if he's stupid enough

523.61 --> 530.66
to bite that and corrupt himself in the

527.72 --> 532.9100000000001
process they love that [ __ ] it's a

530.66 --> 535.79
market it's a the market for corruption

532.91 --> 539.4499999999999
and it's open season to anyone we'll

535.79 --> 542.18
take it you know just take it there's

539.45 --> 545.3290000000001
lots of fancy pants and lollipops out

542.18 --> 546.4699999999999
there for you just to just for the grabs

545.329 --> 550.9399999999999
you just have to take

546.47 --> 554.87
that's all so yeah success success means

550.94 --> 557.3900000000001
money success means subscribers and hey

554.87 --> 560.5600000000001
if you have to get completely maniacal

557.39 --> 563.66
[ __ ] disingenuous manipulative and

560.56 --> 568.3399999999999
monstrous overall for it to achieve that

563.66 --> 570.68
you have my blessings you know you gotta

568.34 --> 579.83
go where you gotta go to get that to get

570.68 --> 581.3299999999999
that ching ching right I should take

579.83 --> 593.44
your wrench away for that remark

581.33 --> 597.9200000000001
sleeping warrior but it's you and the

593.44 --> 600.62
funny or tragic thing about it you don't

597.92 --> 603.77
need some contract with a small hat to

600.62 --> 607.22
do this it's just open market the

603.77 --> 609.56
framework is there just stimulate

607.22 --> 611.72
whatever you like stimulate cool

609.56 --> 614.8699999999999
behavior see how long you can keep it up

611.72 --> 617.4200000000001
how to work stimulate and I'm talking

614.87 --> 622.3
financially or stimulate a [ __ ] show and

617.42 --> 625.6999999999999
see if you can get this this momentum of

622.3 --> 628.2199999999999
anxiety and pressure going and form this

625.7 --> 632.1800000000001
natural arena for the masses who like to

628.22 --> 634.0400000000001
delve into just devouring [ __ ] so they

632.18 --> 637.7299999999999
don't have to feel how stupid and

634.04 --> 640.16
useless and and slave they are so it's

637.73 --> 642.08
an open market you don't need to have a

640.16 --> 644.99
contract with somebody you just follow

642.08 --> 647.87
the code the behavior the direction the

644.99 --> 650.15
objectives and you get there all by

647.87 --> 651.77
yourself you don't have to write you

650.15 --> 657.3199999999999
don't have to cite anywhere your

651.77 --> 659.9499999999999
behavior is the signing so there is my

657.32 --> 659.95
analysis

663.79 --> 676.4599999999999
lovely Tamera coffee that was it

668.08 --> 678.26
aunty not a lot of edibles or any that

676.46 --> 678.83
Tamera coffee did tasted really good

678.26 --> 681.59
though

678.83 --> 686.8100000000001
and with this rainy weather I must feel

681.59 --> 689.74
like I need to get another one but it

686.81 --> 689.7399999999999
probably shouldn't do that

692.72 --> 695.899
[Music]

698.94 --> 709.5500000000001
really okay well sleeping work I've seen

704.82 --> 713.36
Brenda lose it pretty badly before so I

709.55 --> 718.26
have no idea how bad that went that she

713.36 --> 726.71
went in full Marxist or something what

718.26 --> 728.67
yeah what do you expect I would ban you

726.71 --> 731.7800000000001
that's what I would do

728.67 --> 731.78
captain [ __ ]

756.4 --> 769.0
yeah bilgey well sorry I prefer to spend

763.9 --> 771.5699999999999
my time a little bit more amusingly if

769.0 --> 771.57
you don't mind

782.17 --> 791.4399999999999
oh yes sir surah t Cosentino all right

789.64 --> 794.46
when is it gonna go mainstream it is

791.44 --> 798.97
already mainstream it's just not

794.46 --> 802.96
accepted or is is that what you mean

798.97 --> 808.72
when is Flat Earth going to be accepted

802.96 --> 811.63
by by the authority right oh look

808.72 --> 813.64
everybody could there could be Flat

811.63 --> 816.37
Earth being taught in schools it could

813.64 --> 819.79
be all kinds of things that doesn't mean

816.37 --> 822.28
that the authority is ever necessarily

819.79 --> 826.39
going to declassify it it's just gonna

822.28 --> 828.73
be their story like the framework you're

826.39 --> 832.33
gonna have to go with legally in order

828.73 --> 835.48
to interface and they'll probably never

832.33 --> 838.12
give it up but that doesn't mean that

835.48 --> 840.37
it's not going mainstream that it's not

838.12 --> 842.08
spread wide and far and everybody in the

840.37 --> 844.21
world now has heard of it one way or the

842.08 --> 848.8000000000001
other and has their opinion about it has

844.21 --> 850.4200000000001
a certain degree of knowledge so it all

848.8 --> 864.12
depends by what standards you're gonna

850.42 --> 870.04
go now that that's right cation catenin

864.12 --> 876.27
what it will get you banned oh right the

870.04 --> 876.27
wrong band I think Obama Co was first

878.79 --> 882.91
they don't have to say sorry that's

881.02 --> 884.47
exactly what I wanted to do but the

882.91 --> 884.9499999999999
option wasn't there because you were

884.47 --> 891.03
first

884.95 --> 891.0300000000001
so I time them up still ban though

901.92 --> 906.2199999999999
[Music]

903.79 --> 908.11
all right I don't know if your guys not

906.22 --> 910.63
talking among yourselves or if you're

908.11 --> 912.7
addressing me but five angels yes I've

910.63 --> 916.42
had a run-in with Brenda she's been on

912.7 --> 921.9100000000001
this show multiple times and with other

916.42 --> 923.7099999999999
people and I don't allow people to kick

921.91 --> 926.8
in open goals you know it's no use

923.71 --> 930.07
attacking her for that thing that she's

926.8 --> 932.3499999999999
decided to do in her life what the

930.07 --> 935.7700000000001
hell's the use of that I'd rather

932.35 --> 938.25
address her on her technicals and code

935.77 --> 941.23
of conduct if you know what I mean

938.25 --> 944.55
because there's the troubles there are

941.23 --> 947.5500000000001
much more blatant and much more

944.55 --> 947.55
aggressive

954.4 --> 963.27
oh really sleeping warrior huh okay

959.59 --> 963.27
anyway in bad goody

965.01 --> 969.66
does it really even matter nobody even

967.57 --> 973.5400000000001
know it's what she looks like

969.66 --> 984.4
woo a person with a voice screamed on

973.54 --> 988.3199999999999
the Internet goodie yeah that's my

984.4 --> 988.3199999999999
opinion to a reckoner Steffen Alderson

1002.78 --> 1009.47
a Thank You Jennifer winter burn for a

1006.41 --> 1012.73
one-pound 99 pence superjet donation

1009.47 --> 1026.06
thank you and hello to you too

1012.73 --> 1029.75
thanks well mark colored as I said there

1026.06 --> 1032.569
is a concerted efforts from from many

1029.75 --> 1035.3
angles like a priority to get things

1032.569 --> 1039.98
moving on where they beyond where they

1035.3 --> 1043.069
are which is currently the wave of

1039.98 --> 1048.079
activity the development basically is

1043.069 --> 1054.37
resting upon the inside and the attitude

1048.079 --> 1060.3799999999999
of just a few people maybe 10 people and

1054.37 --> 1062.87
this this of course it's not like the

1060.38 --> 1067.25
entire flattered or rests on 10 people

1062.87 --> 1070.3999999999999
no it's um for example our known circle

1067.25 --> 1072.14
and other circles may have maybe 10

1070.4 --> 1074.9
people that are doing in that over there

1072.14 --> 1077.18
but the problem is is that the dynamics

1074.9 --> 1078.95
from outside from those who want to make

1077.18 --> 1081.8
money who want to keep things rolling

1078.95 --> 1084.2
they've lost control to these couple of

1081.8 --> 1088.46
individuals that just are doing it right

1084.2 --> 1091.1000000000001
and guarding their ground guarding the

1088.46 --> 1093.29
purity of the development so what they

1091.1 --> 1094.9699999999998
want they want things rolling they just

1093.29 --> 1097.01
want development they don't care where

1094.97 --> 1099.6200000000001
it's going whether people are developing

1097.01 --> 1101.42
towards their grave or anywhere else

1099.62 --> 1103.31
they don't give a [ __ ] as long as it's

1101.42 --> 1106.5500000000002
developing as long as it will draw an

1103.31 --> 1109.0
attention and that includes the trolls

1106.55 --> 1112.7
personal agenda also by the way not just

1109.0 --> 1115.22
moneymakers so there is a concerted

1112.7 --> 1117.73
effort just to push corruption in any

1115.22 --> 1120.2
way possible through financial through

1117.73 --> 1123.65
financial drops through censorship

1120.2 --> 1125.6000000000001
through trolling just to screw up all

1123.65 --> 1129.0500000000002
the developments and get that control

1125.6 --> 1133.01
away from these core individuals that

1129.05 --> 1136.28
are upholding the development by

1133.01 --> 1139.67
agitating and just discouraging them

1136.28 --> 1141.92
get out and get out of the way like a

1139.67 --> 1143.8400000000001
rough example what happened with

1141.92 --> 1145.67
Patricia stare she was one of these

1143.84 --> 1147.9199999999998
individuals even though she wasn't all

1145.67 --> 1151.91
that technical she was an individual

1147.92 --> 1155.98
that was literally up holding dragging

1151.91 --> 1159.23
the net with all the fishies with us

1155.98 --> 1162.68
kind of keeping it together there was a

1159.23 --> 1164.81
function and because of all the bullying

1162.68 --> 1168.5
and [ __ ] that went away we lost that

1164.81 --> 1171.62
level we lost a one of the Nets one of

1168.5 --> 1173.75
the cohesion factors and that is their

1171.62 --> 1176.75
tactic just bully the [ __ ] out of

1173.75 --> 1180.59
everyone censor things troll Stockham

1176.75 --> 1184.1
and get it out of the way so that the

1180.59 --> 1187.34
the demons will be left just to devour

1184.1 --> 1189.83
it all and destroy it all and blacken

1187.34 --> 1192.9199999999998
the interest and the reputation forever

1189.83 --> 1195.35
so there will be a decade of shame upon

1192.92 --> 1198.65
the very concept because they're the

1195.35 --> 1202.04
ones that are there to show the world

1198.65 --> 1205.21
how disgusting people can get placed

1202.04 --> 1209.69
right under the attack that we try to

1205.21 --> 1212.0900000000001
together lift up be a symbol of truth

1209.69 --> 1215.54
and freedom and personal development and

1212.09 --> 1218.27
that what I described is what they want

1215.54 --> 1220.04
it to become so it's up to all of you

1218.27 --> 1221.75
it's much more serious than you even

1220.04 --> 1224.96
realize you think that some of these

1221.75 --> 1227.0
things are entertaining when people

1224.96 --> 1228.8
start misbehaving and violently

1227.0 --> 1230.69
threatening others it's so amusing

1228.8 --> 1234.5
always losing in control oh look at the

1230.69 --> 1237.17
cloud but you don't realize in the

1234.5 --> 1238.76
thread of it all in the framework of

1237.17 --> 1242.3000000000002
everything that's happening what that

1238.76 --> 1245.69
influence will do and every time that

1242.3 --> 1248.18
happens what what does that do it's

1245.69 --> 1250.97
corrupting it corrupts everyone

1248.18 --> 1254.39
involving with them they get a release

1250.97 --> 1256.52
of all kinds of feelings and yeah they

1254.39 --> 1258.89
kept on moving it maybe even somewhat

1256.52 --> 1261.83
inspirational for a moment but at the

1258.89 --> 1264.23
same time the calm thought that actually

1261.83 --> 1267.8899999999999
helps focus reaching the insights that

1264.23 --> 1269.75
are very hard to attain they that energy

1267.89 --> 1272.75
from that moment every time

1269.75 --> 1276.5
we'll waiver it will detract itself

1272.75 --> 1280.79
people that go after clown shows lose

1276.5 --> 1282.8
their mind they lose their focus they

1280.79 --> 1285.47
lose their ability to attain that

1282.8 --> 1287.45
insight that is what happens and the

1285.47 --> 1289.4
funny thing is there's a lot of admits

1287.45 --> 1292.94
are tragic there's a lot of people out

1289.4 --> 1295.8200000000002
there that then choose that because they

1292.94 --> 1299.6000000000001
feel I can deal with this I could never

1295.82 --> 1302.1499999999999
be smart enough to get that but they

1299.6 --> 1303.9199999999998
don't realize it is because of the

1302.15 --> 1306.02
poison they are drinking because of the

1303.92 --> 1307.8500000000001
bad behaviors they are reproducing and

1306.02 --> 1309.86
following that is the thing that is

1307.85 --> 1314.1499999999999
preventing them from attaining that pure

1309.86 --> 1317.57
insight it is their straying of the path

1314.15 --> 1321.71
for themselves that is causing that not

1317.57 --> 1323.72
a general incapability know it is their

1321.71 --> 1328.3400000000001
choice is their delusion their errors

1323.72 --> 1333.59
that made attaining that insight

1328.34 --> 1335.84
impossible that is my opinion and I've

1333.59 --> 1339.98
seen the transition I've seen people

1335.84 --> 1343.1
from being insecure trolls that last you

1339.98 --> 1345.92
out just because they were insecure from

1343.1 --> 1350.84
focusing and certainly understanding

1345.92 --> 1352.8500000000001
higher levels of information or before

1350.84 --> 1356.9599999999998
they had no grip because their energies

1352.85 --> 1359.75
could not they were too diffused they

1356.96 --> 1362.72
couldn't reach that critical peak in

1359.75 --> 1365.6
order to attain the inside so when you

1362.72 --> 1370.46
then help these people manage their own

1365.6 --> 1372.5
energies cure their ailments cure their

1370.46 --> 1375.1000000000001
insecurities then suddenly they may

1372.5 --> 1375.1
attain it

1378.53 --> 1386.6
so enough preaching about that for now

1381.41 --> 1386.6000000000001
I'm definitely not gonna invite Brenda I

1389.42 --> 1395.46
don't think Brenda probably wants to be

1392.25 --> 1397.83
on shows she's gonna be scoffed at by

1395.46 --> 1399.39
everyone even the ballers now so she's

1397.83 --> 1402.87
probably just gonna take a break or

1399.39 --> 1408.92
maybe she's just gonna I don't know what

1402.87 --> 1411.57
the hell she's gonna do but I shouldn't

1408.92 --> 1414.96
even if I wanted to shouldn't talk to

1411.57 --> 1418.74
her at this moment before seeing what

1414.96 --> 1421.23
actually happened just to know the level

1418.74 --> 1423.81
of impact it would have made otherwise

1421.23 --> 1429.3600000000001
I'm just gonna size up the situation

1423.81 --> 1432.84
wrong then again I really just don't

1429.36 --> 1433.84
want to talk to Brenda never leads

1432.84 --> 1436.9199999999998
anywhere really

1433.84 --> 1436.9199999999998
[Music]

1442.0 --> 1455.54
she melted if you try to wax sculpt

1452.18 --> 1459.55
yourself into your own fantasy then yeah

1455.54 --> 1459.55
the heat turns up you will start to melt

1486.759 --> 1491.23
ah

1487.04 --> 1491.23
[Music]

1499.49 --> 1519.24
five angels come on yeah you're right

1509.07 --> 1522.1799999999998
but it's so obvious like it's not like

1519.24 --> 1525.63
she's trying to hide that wound that she

1522.18 --> 1528.0600000000002
really is stupid that she really doesn't

1525.63 --> 1532.0200000000002
get things that she memorizes things but

1528.06 --> 1535.2
she just doesn't get it she can only

1532.02 --> 1537.27
mimic it seems the understandings of

1535.2 --> 1540.39
others and doesn't really get a total

1537.27 --> 1541.34
cohesion of these things not a strong

1540.39 --> 1544.49
one anyway

1541.34 --> 1544.49
[Music]

1549.97 --> 1554.1100000000001
and hey you can get very far with

1552.34 --> 1557.879
memorization you know if you're very

1554.11 --> 1563.379
good at it yeah you could literally

1557.879 --> 1564.9699999999998
pretend to know or yeah you you can

1563.379 --> 1566.799
pretend pretty much anything you could

1564.97 --> 1569.019
just learn it whatever you think you're

1566.799 --> 1571.929
going to need and then pretend to be

1569.019 --> 1574.36
super smart at it until you actually get

1571.929 --> 1578.22
tested and then you crash because you

1574.36 --> 1580.899
don't you don't have the relevant data

1578.22 --> 1582.21
memorized and then you're going to be

1580.899 --> 1584.5
thrown back on your actual

1582.21 --> 1588.3400000000001
understandings of these things which is

1584.5 --> 1590.2
feeble if you ran out in this case

1588.34 --> 1592.6589999999999
because most people that have eidetic

1590.2 --> 1595.45
memory also have a certain level of

1592.659 --> 1597.5800000000002
insight not necessarily there's people

1595.45 --> 1600.269
that really have the memory and just not

1597.58 --> 1600.269
that insight

1616.16 --> 1623.0
now reckoner Stefan hey listen I have

1618.95 --> 1627.0800000000002
listened and I've recognized that her

1623.0 --> 1630.17
ideas are not original and I can even

1627.08 --> 1634.61
trace back very easily what she's trying

1630.17 --> 1636.95
to do she's literally trying to starting

1634.61 --> 1639.86
out with the scientific method but also

1636.95 --> 1642.6200000000001
every everything else and trying to

1639.86 --> 1647.99
attempting to basically doing it drawing

1642.62 --> 1651.4599999999998
it into the philosophical realm and that

1647.99 --> 1654.6200000000001
is kind of a red herring to do that

1651.46 --> 1656.8400000000001
taking it away from the tangible from

1654.62 --> 1658.6399999999999
that strict adherence into the

1656.84 --> 1661.28
philosophical where all kinds of things

1658.64 --> 1664.7800000000002
become possible and that's what she's

1661.28 --> 1670.1299999999999
doing every time and it's totally

1664.78 --> 1674.45
useless what she's doing is at the root

1670.13 --> 1678.8300000000002
cause of the very problems that riddled

1674.45 --> 1682.79
that the scientific literature what

1678.83 --> 1685.1
Feynman is like half his stuff is all

1682.79 --> 1687.44
about it's all about is freaking math

1685.1 --> 1690.2199999999998
obsession with things that can never be

1687.44 --> 1692.9
proven that aren't even that relevant so

1690.22 --> 1696.19
presuppositional house a card building

1692.9 --> 1696.19
it's useless

1711.12 --> 1716.3999999999999
no no that's not true magnet pulls

1713.57 --> 1719.46
magnet spool absolutely not you know

1716.4 --> 1724.0500000000002
that's a lie it's a straight face lie

1719.46 --> 1728.19
I don't spout any of that

1724.05 --> 1730.29
I freaking figure it out relative

1728.19 --> 1734.01
density beyond anything they've

1730.29 --> 1736.26
originally brought to the table as they

1734.01 --> 1738.33
were trying to even explain everything

1736.26 --> 1742.92
surrounding it they mostly just stepped

1738.33 --> 1744.48
away said no not necessary or just threw

1742.92 --> 1746.73
out whatever because they didn't even

1744.48 --> 1749.07
consider it I actually am the one that

1746.73 --> 1752.88
totally figured it out and put it down

1749.07 --> 1757.62
piece by piece okay that's not mimicking

1752.88 --> 1761.0700000000002
Nathan or QE I did that I did that by

1757.62 --> 1762.9299999999998
myself that maybe a little help from

1761.07 --> 1767.87
sleeping warrior who did kind of think

1762.93 --> 1767.8700000000001
along with me and that was very nice

1771.62 --> 1780.83
well maybe magnet but maybe it's because

1776.19 --> 1783.8600000000001
it wasn't life because it was a premiere

1780.83 --> 1789.09
it's how do you get invited to a

1783.86 --> 1793.6499999999999
pre-recorded thing and before I didn't

1789.09 --> 1795.6
go there I didn't join it at first I

1793.65 --> 1800.4
didn't join it on purpose then later I

1795.6 --> 1803.73
just didn't really I wasn't I wasn't in

1800.4 --> 1806.69
the QE Skype room anymore because I left

1803.73 --> 1811.38
because of some issues back then

1806.69 --> 1814.5
slick James Johnson I think he also left

1811.38 --> 1816.96
in the meantime that's the reason why

1814.5 --> 1818.55
it's what we saw yesterday I didn't even

1816.96 --> 1821.3400000000001
know at the time because I didn't pay

1818.55 --> 1823.6399999999999
too much attention it was from a while

1821.34 --> 1823.6399999999999
back

1826.23 --> 1832.47
and I don't know if I'm gonna be invited

1829.02 --> 1834.8899999999999
on any new ballbuster show life we'll

1832.47 --> 1834.89
see

1846.51 --> 1855.54
I don't think so magnet spool don't

1849.27 --> 1859.1399999999999
think so but they thought he would could

1855.54 --> 1861.93
be an interesting win wingman because of

1859.14 --> 1865.46
his his personal philosophical approach

1861.93 --> 1865.46
to thinks they thought that was amusing

1868.37 --> 1874.28
but and Yin didn't really work out all

1871.29 --> 1876.12
that well if you paid any attention but

1874.28 --> 1878.07
I'm still there

1876.12 --> 1889.8899999999999
I've been on the flat earth debate since

1878.07 --> 1892.32
episode 50 or something yeah okay it's

1889.89 --> 1894.18
time for you to piss off troll I know

1892.32 --> 1896.61
you're a troll and you're constantly

1894.18 --> 1901.16
drawing my attention with your whining

1896.61 --> 1901.1599999999999
in your manipulation attempts [ __ ] off

1902.81 --> 1909.44
[Music]

1904.97 --> 1912.44
gamma wanker why don't you make a show

1909.44 --> 1912.44
[ __ ]

1920.69 --> 1929.5990000000002
oh he is

1926.509 --> 1932.919
well okay mark tailors also a wanker so

1929.599 --> 1932.9189999999999
that would fit perfectly then

1944.24 --> 1947.41
[Music]

1949.2 --> 1953.79
all right yeah look I don't mind if

1951.69 --> 1956.8400000000001
people ask me a couple of questions but

1953.79 --> 1960.81
he was literally almost like newspaper

1956.84 --> 1964.59
prepared level lines of questions like

1960.81 --> 1967.1699999999998
what can be asked to Arwen in order to

1964.59 --> 1969.3799999999999
gas like the [ __ ] out of the situation

1967.17 --> 1972.21
try to make me feel unappreciated

1969.38 --> 1974.5200000000002
miserable uncertain about myself in

1972.21 --> 1976.92
order just create that correct because

1974.52 --> 1980.19
they can't help it it's Satan it's Satan

1976.92 --> 1983.19
they have to break it everything has to

1980.19 --> 1985.68
be put there just to break it apart cuz

1983.19 --> 1989.46
they can't stand they can't stand our I

1985.68 --> 1993.8400000000001
keep keep it straight they can't stand

1989.46 --> 1996.27
it no no they want that a winning rage

1993.84 --> 1997.6499999999999
because it's so funny and oh come on

1996.27 --> 2000.05
come on are we just getting angry

1997.65 --> 2002.75
because so funny when you get angry in a

2000.05 --> 2004.76
hood you get more people more trolls

2002.75 --> 2007.34
will subscribe to you so you can get a

2004.76 --> 2009.41
temporary boost of confidence so they

2007.34 --> 2012.28
can take away again and maybe cause more

2009.41 --> 2014.51
Rachel can be in our winni enrage engine

2012.28 --> 2017.12
going back and forth that's what they

2014.51 --> 2019.85
want well go screw yourself

2017.12 --> 2022.04
I'm not doing it as soon as I found out

2019.85 --> 2025.54
somebody is trying to systematically

2022.04 --> 2025.54
manipulate me band

2033.09 --> 2038.9499999999998
so yeah I do know what you're doing even

2037.09 --> 2045.37
though you think you can hide that I can

2038.95 --> 2049.11
read it what you're doing there's no

2045.37 --> 2049.1099999999997
escaping from that [ __ ]

2056.94 --> 2060.9
[Music]

2063.46 --> 2067.73
right five angels but yeah that's the

2066.26 --> 2073.7900000000004
thing about you

2067.73 --> 2078.5
you're also a troll [ __ ] and I don't

2073.79 --> 2080.929
know it's only a matter of time at this

2078.5 --> 2083.21
point before I also ban you I don't know

2080.929 --> 2085.369
even why you came here you're one of

2083.21 --> 2087.71
those flattered debate trolls that like

2085.369 --> 2092.389
to keep hanging around there and just so

2087.71 --> 2095.049
as much misery as you can well I don't

2092.389 --> 2095.049
really care

2100.34 --> 2106.4
you know what you can follow whoever you

2102.8 --> 2108.02
like there's some pretty bad [ __ ] out

2106.4 --> 2110.6600000000003
there hey if you want some crazy

2108.02 --> 2113.39
amusement I'm sure you'll be able to

2110.66 --> 2116.93
define some kind of YouTube or source

2113.39 --> 2120.1
out there that borders or crosses many

2116.93 --> 2123.08
borders reaching into the illegal and

2120.1 --> 2126.7999999999997
he'll they'll be very amusing just go

2123.08 --> 2130.61
there just go there go go to the madman

2126.8 --> 2133.82
it's it's right up your alley

2130.61 --> 2133.82
[Music]

2136.06 --> 2149.0
but not in here in here I don't give a

2144.17 --> 2152.77
crap I'd rather be bored not talk a lot

2149.0 --> 2159.14
not have subjects to talk about than

2152.77 --> 2163.97
entertaining or feeding trolls I may

2159.14 --> 2165.92
address them just just to give a hint to

2163.97 --> 2167.6299999999997
my audience that I'm not scared and that

2165.92 --> 2171.89
I'm very serious about this that I do

2167.63 --> 2175.04
see them as a threat but that I am NOT

2171.89 --> 2178.22
gonna be fooled into troll baiting in

2175.04 --> 2185.06
the way that they want people to troll

2178.22 --> 2189.43
bait and I reckon our Stefan Alderson

2185.06 --> 2189.43
you're not really a troll not really

2189.61 --> 2196.3700000000003
that's not a troll a real troll are

2192.35 --> 2198.3199999999997
people that are miserable you have to be

2196.37 --> 2200.2999999999997
if you're not miserable you're not a

2198.32 --> 2203.9
troll it doesn't work have to be

2200.3 --> 2207.77
miserable somehow in order to fuel an

2203.9 --> 2209.27
obsessive need to say things that try to

2207.77 --> 2212.53
bring somebody out of balance

2209.27 --> 2215.48
that's the troll so you're constantly

2212.53 --> 2217.1600000000003
testing their earthing constant there it

2215.48 --> 2219.8
is if you're a troll you can't have

2217.16 --> 2225.7999999999997
respect for people that conflict you

2219.8 --> 2228.11
can't be respectful they that usually

2225.8 --> 2230.69
just completely bypassed that pretty

2228.11 --> 2232.76
fault that's the real troll if you're a

2230.69 --> 2233.7200000000003
bit of a smartass and you like to point

2232.76 --> 2235.3100000000004
out people are

2233.72 --> 2241.1299999999997
being stupid when they're being stupid

2235.31 --> 2246.859
that's not a troll real trolls are

2241.13 --> 2249.2000000000003
really miserable people it's almost an

2246.859 --> 2251.0299999999997
uncomfortable truth if you touch upon it

2249.2 --> 2253.79
because you see it you know it kind of

2251.03 --> 2256.73
but you don't like to look there because

2253.79 --> 2260.93
of the severity of how bad it actually

2256.73 --> 2264.59
is with these people and that they allow

2260.93 --> 2266.8399999999997
that to themselves that's a pretty

2264.59 --> 2270.08
miserable thing to realize so most

2266.84 --> 2275.109
people just dumb I'd like to look too

2270.08 --> 2275.109
close because you get sick it's natural

2278.32 --> 2284.0
all right yes your check oh yeah people

2281.39 --> 2286.1299999999997
you can be trolling to others but if you

2284.0 --> 2289.04
do that face-to-face it's only a matter

2286.13 --> 2292.9100000000003
of time before you get a punched in the

2289.04 --> 2295.55
face so hey that's worth the risk for

2292.91 --> 2300.1299999999997
you go ahead and be true in in normal

2295.55 --> 2300.13
life it's up to you

2305.52 --> 2313.87
well no right look Ragnar Stefan he'll

2310.87 --> 2316.6
listen right the hand doesn't completely

2313.87 --> 2319.5099999999998
fit that description cuz he does

2316.6 --> 2328.2999999999997
actually try to build something it's

2319.51 --> 2329.5600000000004
just that he has no self-control none

2328.3 --> 2332.71
none whatsoever

2329.56 --> 2334.81
and he surrender to that so he will

2332.71 --> 2338.05
basically be pushed around by his inner

2334.81 --> 2343.09
self to become like a troll to fight on

2338.05 --> 2346.0
the level of a troll but he's not he's

2343.09 --> 2349.3
not devoid of of it all

2346.0 --> 2351.13
a real troll doesn't have a life a real

2349.3 --> 2355.48
troll would never show their face a real

2351.13 --> 2357.96
troll would never try to engage to

2355.48 --> 2361.18
actually really build something or

2357.96 --> 2363.19
inspire they just go out to try and

2361.18 --> 2366.8199999999997
destroy everything now right the hand

2363.19 --> 2374.08
does that a lot but he mostly does it

2366.82 --> 2380.0800000000004
out of like paranoia so I know it's not

2374.08 --> 2387.46
a he's not not really a troll but he

2380.08 --> 2390.19
does troll so let's just say right the

2387.46 --> 2394.32
hand is not a troll but you can think of

2390.19 --> 2394.32
him as a troll how about that money

2399.32 --> 2402.32
yeah

2408.74 --> 2411.3689999999997
yeah

2414.09 --> 2424.1200000000003
anyway I know you people like me to

2419.5 --> 2427.03
analyze others but it is kind of yeah

2424.12 --> 2429.43
now I'm gonna end up this becoming my

2427.03 --> 2431.2000000000003
thing and me being the psycho and a list

2429.43 --> 2432.7
of people others out there and it's not

2431.2 --> 2434.5899999999997
gonna make a lot of Flat Earth is

2432.7 --> 2437.8199999999997
comfortable with me they'll be afraid

2434.59 --> 2441.94
maybe to be psychoanalyzed I guess

2437.82 --> 2445.06
unless they are actually wise and

2441.94 --> 2447.4
sensible and not haunted by some weird

2445.06 --> 2449.89
problems in themselves and with troll

2447.4 --> 2451.96
behavior and then they may recognize let

2449.89 --> 2454.48
yeah he's really trying to do the right

2451.96 --> 2456.9700000000003
thing being honest giving credit where

2454.48 --> 2462.07
credit is due and attacking misbehavior

2456.97 --> 2464.1099999999997
and then they would know okay I'm trying

2462.07 --> 2468.55
to do the right thing I have problems I

2464.11 --> 2471.13
recognize them I try to improve them if

2468.55 --> 2473.2000000000003
they're like that you have no problem

2471.13 --> 2479.4100000000003
with me I'll be the one actually having

2473.2 --> 2481.7799999999997
more problems because yeah because if

2479.41 --> 2484.42
somebody's doing really well and being a

2481.78 --> 2486.67
good person then I feel like yeah I'm

2484.42 --> 2488.11
being a good person but am I really

2486.67 --> 2491.5
doing well mm-hmm

2488.11 --> 2495.85
I guess could be worse so that would be

2491.5 --> 2497.53
the issue then but nobody that is a good

2495.85 --> 2500.44
person really trying to do the right

2497.53 --> 2504.8500000000004
thing and not trying to be kinda a money

2500.44 --> 2509.4
sponge somehow bypassing the things that

2504.85 --> 2514.7799999999997
really matter there should be no problem

2509.4 --> 2517.39
in your dealings with me and well I

2514.78 --> 2521.59
think for example ego playing an anchor

2517.39 --> 2523.98
kind of tone to that right should still

2521.59 --> 2523.98
be here

2524.119 --> 2530.0190000000002
and I hope that many others will also

2527.059 --> 2530.0190000000002
atone to that

2539.309 --> 2545.029
uh-huh that sucks peanuts Claire

2550.87 --> 2561.42
whoo man I'm taking off this thing

2554.02 --> 2561.42
because I'm it's getting way too moist

2565.93 --> 2569.12
[Music]

2580.2 --> 2586.6
no no I'm gonna leave it to that it's

2584.56 --> 2593.22
definitely not warm enough to take off

2586.6 --> 2593.22
my shirt as well yeah

2606.859 --> 2616.95
mmm-hmm now infinite Lottie society

2613.859 --> 2622.89
you're not really cool but at least you

2616.95 --> 2625.7
behave so that's a good thing

2622.89 --> 2625.7
keep it up

2626.48 --> 2630.139
[Music]

2640.21 --> 2652.13
mm oh yeah I've been also watching some

2649.67 --> 2655.48
more Owen Benjamin it's yeah II really

2652.13 --> 2655.48
isn't live-streaming anymore

2659.53 --> 2669.38
but okay as I showed yesterday there's

2665.63 --> 2671.09
still the link to an authorized TV and

2669.38 --> 2675.5
you can still watch it so I have watched

2671.09 --> 2680.21
it and still good but I do miss being

2675.5 --> 2685.84
able to join it live to see it as it

2680.21 --> 2692.45
goes so I think well I'm thinking like

2685.84 --> 2695.86
could I maybe subscribe and would it be

2692.45 --> 2695.8599999999997
worth it what do you guys think

2701.219 --> 2707.259
yeah God but yeah yeah but I'm

2705.099 --> 2710.1090000000004
definitely not gonna join Instagram

2707.259 --> 2712.14
Hannah bear pretty sure I'm not gonna do

2710.109 --> 2712.14
that

2718.48 --> 2726.609
unless you can do that without having

2722.5 --> 2729.18
some kind of account oh that might be

2726.609 --> 2729.18
worth it

2751.28 --> 2754.28
okay

2760.24 --> 2767.77
yeah I think I'm mostly just hot not so

2764.08 --> 2773.4
are not so much hot as very moist it is

2767.77 --> 2773.4
really moist outside so yeah

2781.21 --> 2789.11
by the way I did listen back to

2785.3 --> 2795.25
yesterday's show and I was pretty

2789.11 --> 2801.29
shocked to hear what I put down as in

2795.25 --> 2803.33
how good it was I put out some trains of

2801.29 --> 2805.7599999999998
thought and they were really good in

2803.33 --> 2807.92
retrospect it's funny because as I was

2805.76 --> 2811.28
doing it it didn't seem like too much of

2807.92 --> 2817.7000000000003
a big deal but I I wonder if you guys

2811.28 --> 2819.8
agree if you even caught it but I feel

2817.7 --> 2830.06
there is at least some improvement in

2819.8 --> 2832.8500000000004
the way I explained things I don't know

2830.06 --> 2837.29
maybe I'm just now being all oh look at

2832.85 --> 2838.69
me and I'm improving I'm good right this

2837.29 --> 2841.07
is all worth it

2838.69 --> 2843.32
that is all worth it because I love

2841.07 --> 2845.81
having you guys around and I really do

2843.32 --> 2850.15
appreciate all the support and even if

2845.81 --> 2853.82
it is just emotional support or just

2850.15 --> 2856.46
having my back again some other trolls

2853.82 --> 2859.76
that that really does feel good and I

2856.46 --> 2863.78
really do like doing the show just for

2859.76 --> 2866.42
that as well but at the same time I do

2863.78 --> 2868.3700000000003
have my own pride and I want to be

2866.42 --> 2871.69
developing I want to be getting better

2868.37 --> 2875.87
at what I do

2871.69 --> 2878.4500000000003
and hope that at some point there will

2875.87 --> 2882.2
be others that would like to try out

2878.45 --> 2885.3199999999997
things in conjunction with me as a as a

2882.2 --> 2888.49
youtuber besides Nathan I will always

2885.32 --> 2888.4900000000002
ask me honest panelists

2891.89 --> 2903.0989999999997
ah just in time to fix like this like

2897.859 --> 2910.7
ratio yeah that thing is messy as crap

2903.099 --> 2913.7000000000003
did let's see that was crazy

2910.7 --> 2916.269
yesterday's show that didn't make any

2913.7 --> 2916.269
damn sense

2916.989 --> 2923.15
there was like oh right well when I

2920.45 --> 2925.97
ended it and I refreshed and everything

2923.15 --> 2930.079
it said it had three up votes while I

2925.97 --> 2931.819
had at least 50 live viewers so and I'm

2930.079 --> 2935.509
pretty sure that I counted more than

2931.819 --> 2938.21
three people that I do appreciate in my

2935.509 --> 2940.609
chat so it does just didn't make any

2938.21 --> 2943.5190000000002
damn sense to have ended with three

2940.609 --> 2946.3089999999997
votes up and not that it really matters

2943.519 --> 2948.529
it's just this little extra thing they

2946.309 --> 2951.4100000000003
like to do just to see if they can get

2948.529 --> 2957.94
to me whoever is doing that and whatever

2951.41 --> 2963.739
screwing around with the with the data

2957.94 --> 2965.989
at YouTube's but now it's at three and

2963.739 --> 2971.93
at eleven fo it's still not super

2965.989 --> 2975.38
impressive but sometimes it just it just

2971.93 --> 2978.6499999999996
gets blatantly illogical and wrong to

2975.38 --> 2985.2490000000003
your face Wow oh thanks right away guys

2978.65 --> 2988.64
for the up votes right now alright and

2985.249 --> 2990.5589999999997
once again at once again happened before

2988.64 --> 2994.7889999999998
at least three or four times I'm

2990.559 --> 3000.309
approaching the 1,400 again it's been

2994.789 --> 3002.8590000000004
down to thirteen hundred and eighty-five

3000.309 --> 3005.619
votes in the last week I think and I was

3002.859 --> 3008.2889999999998
going back up again so we'll see if I

3005.619 --> 3009.94
get past that 1400 mark not that it

3008.289 --> 3013.0890000000004
really matters but it's almost like a

3009.94 --> 3016.779
curiosity to me now because it just

3013.089 --> 3018.869
doesn't seem logical to me that that

3016.779 --> 3022.809
that is really the amount of people

3018.869 --> 3025.21
subscribing to me it just doesn't match

3022.809 --> 3040.4100000000003
up but everything else out there

3025.21 --> 3040.41
oh well it is what it is hello neil w

3052.0 --> 3061.24
all right that's right gleam and it I

3058.02 --> 3064.619
think I also know how they do it because

3061.24 --> 3069.609
this thing happened before like it

3064.619 --> 3074.8900000000003
almost a decade ago I think in no wait

3069.609 --> 3077.23
no no if a few years ago like two years

3074.89 --> 3082.14
this seems like a decade ago it happened

3077.23 --> 3083.43
to YouTube channels that try to stream

3082.14 --> 3086.859
Infowars

3083.43 --> 3088.8999999999996
show like streaming on their YouTube

3086.859 --> 3091.96
channel with full permission and then

3088.9 --> 3093.9100000000003
they would screw the votes like like

3091.96 --> 3096.52
just like this we're like really really

3093.91 --> 3098.6499999999996
down made no sense chat was just

3096.52 --> 3103.42
exploding with activity and it just

3098.65 --> 3105.19
couldn't go past what is it 11 up votes

3103.42 --> 3108.58
or something it just never went past

3105.19 --> 3112.29
that didn't make any damn sense but then

3108.58 --> 3117.0989999999997
after a while like after a long time

3112.29 --> 3120.339
suddenly the actual votes would be

3117.099 --> 3122.7400000000002
restored so it's like the fake mask the

3120.339 --> 3125.08
little board with what you're supposed

3122.74 --> 3126.91
to be believing that was put in front of

3125.08 --> 3128.77
it with the fake amount of votes was

3126.91 --> 3131.3799999999997
just taken away so you could see what

3128.77 --> 3133.359
was actually done and then it turned out

3131.38 --> 3136.75
to be a lot more of course so I wonder

3133.359 --> 3139.859
is that is is that what's happening with

3136.75 --> 3143.5
my votes and if I'm gonna look back

3139.859 --> 3146.7999999999997
after maybe half a year that these

3143.5 --> 3149.02
videos will they have the real amount of

3146.8 --> 3152.4700000000003
votes it's not gonna matter anymore for

3149.02 --> 3158.74
these trending situation so I wonder if

3152.47 --> 3162.33
they do that just artificial stifling to

3158.74 --> 3162.33
make me look not interesting

3170.45 --> 3180.859
keep two topics right well the topic so

3176.089 --> 3183.2889999999998
far have been the more chaos between

3180.859 --> 3186.049
ballers and flat-earthers and crazy

3183.289 --> 3191.7400000000002
misbehaviors and raging and I don't know

3186.049 --> 3194.18
I don't that's not even really on topic

3191.74 --> 3205.8489999999997
it's just meta talked about the

3194.18 --> 3208.3089999999997
community and no crazy everybody is as

3205.849 --> 3211.069
for the actual flatter topics the

3208.309 --> 3213.88
flatter developments new tests and

3211.069 --> 3216.95
things and there's a lot still pending

3213.88 --> 3218.96
there's just a lot of new ideas projects

3216.95 --> 3221.029
people are trying new things out and

3218.96 --> 3223.039
it's just all in the work so there's not

3221.029 --> 3232.519
a lot of current things that's like oh

3223.039 --> 3234.23
wow it's just happen that I hope maybe

3232.519 --> 3236.14
I'm just wrong right now and then I

3234.23 --> 3240.14
completely missed out certain things

3236.14 --> 3242.96
because I don't know as I said I go to

3240.14 --> 3245.66
bed very early and a lot of flat

3242.96 --> 3248.9900000000002
earthers which are Americans do

3245.66 --> 3253.5389999999998
typically get active after 12 o'clock

3248.99 --> 3262.75
Dutch time after midnight for me so I am

3253.539 --> 3262.75
not fully aware of who who's doing what

3263.71 --> 3267.609
as much as I used

3276.97 --> 3279.6899999999996
hmm

3286.23 --> 3295.17
all right oh well maybe there is little

3290.16 --> 3298.0789999999997
on topic thing I'm I'm gonna round the

3295.17 --> 3300.96
shell out not too long anyway about five

3298.079 --> 3302.9700000000003
minutes or so so but as I've been

3300.96 --> 3306.869
sharing I've been watching The Big Bang

3302.97 --> 3309.66
Theory kind of as a hobby side project

3306.869 --> 3312.4500000000003
it is amusing I am comfortable with

3309.66 --> 3315.72
hanging around with geeks from my past

3312.45 --> 3317.72
so I don't have this standard repulsion

3315.72 --> 3320.97
that maybe a lot of people would have I

3317.72 --> 3321.8689999999997
don't have any nerd honor issues either

3320.97 --> 3324.2999999999997
anymore

3321.869 --> 3326.25
so to me it is still very amusing and

3324.3 --> 3329.01
there is a lot happening in there that

3326.25 --> 3334.02
has to do with cultural programming too

3329.01 --> 3335.7900000000004
and to me it's a gem mine with the

3334.02 --> 3338.25
current understanding I have and I like

3335.79 --> 3341.25
to watch it that way and racing the

3338.25 --> 3343.67
recent few episodes like yeah the guy

3341.25 --> 3348.089
that I talked about yesterday even the

3343.67 --> 3351.4500000000003
Wolowitz the technician guy he actually

3348.089 --> 3354.06
it was all filmed and everything he was

3351.45 --> 3355.77
launched in a rocket and he was it was

3354.06 --> 3356.31
so funny because he was so scared and

3355.77 --> 3360.17
blah blah blah

3356.31 --> 3362.64
and then there were scenes where he was

3360.17 --> 3365.2200000000003
in the International Space Station

3362.64 --> 3368.16
having back and forth calls with his

3365.22 --> 3371.1899999999996
mother and his girlfriend and hahaha the

3368.16 --> 3373.47
issues like he could never get away from

3371.19 --> 3375.7200000000003
that even though while he's in space

3373.47 --> 3379.6699999999996
that was the joke but at the same time I

3375.72 --> 3382.819
was just looking what they did because

3379.67 --> 3386.31
you'd think oh yeah sure whatever well

3382.819 --> 3389.609
he in those scenes was literally

3386.31 --> 3394.73
floating around and I was really

3389.609 --> 3394.73
impressed in how well they did that and

3395.569 --> 3400.5
I'm really wondering how did they do

3398.04 --> 3405.99
that because it looked really good how

3400.5 --> 3409.29
did they set it up it was to me much

3405.99 --> 3413.4599999999996
more believable if you yeah then any

3409.29 --> 3415.859
life thing from the ISS so you yeah

3413.46 --> 3418.85
maybe it's worth taking a look if you

3415.859 --> 3428.54
have enough Netflix or something it was

3418.85 --> 3433.5699999999997
let's see yet it's the ending of season

3428.54 --> 3436.58
5 maybe up until the start of season 6

3433.57 --> 3439.04
he's there doing stuff and it's just

3436.58 --> 3441.59
what if you don't like the series just

3439.04 --> 3445.0299999999997
take a look at the trickery of how he's

3441.59 --> 3447.86
doing stuff and having zero gravity

3445.03 --> 3450.17
interactions with pens in the air and

3447.86 --> 3450.86
and just how he moves around how that

3450.17 --> 3456.9700000000003
looks

3450.86 --> 3456.9700000000003
it looks really well done for a series

3470.15 --> 3475.4500000000003
yeah then it was I don't be a smartass

3479.95 --> 3491.48
right yeah in a way I have outgrown that

3483.23 --> 3493.73
stuff but yeah that doesn't mean that

3491.48 --> 3496.759
I'll never go there I was just sick of

3493.73 --> 3499.4
it back then it's it's so weird how I

3496.759 --> 3503.119
can be in a certain mood like two weeks

3499.4 --> 3506.6600000000003
ago and just be really sick of listening

3503.119 --> 3508.4900000000002
to the same whining of Brenda or schema

3506.66 --> 3511.94
with all their nonsense on the debates

3508.49 --> 3515.39
for hours on end yeah I got sick of that

3511.94 --> 3520.66
and that's why I said I just don't want

3515.39 --> 3524.39
that [ __ ] anymore but yeah I went back

3520.66 --> 3526.67
because I do still like interactions

3524.39 --> 3538.4
there and there's some good discussions

3526.67 --> 3541.009
and I have input yeah but hey it's no

3538.4 --> 3543.319
guarantee that I'm just gonna now all

3541.009 --> 3546.349
I'm gonna stay there forever look it's

3543.319 --> 3549.049
gonna be continued was [ __ ] showing with

3546.349 --> 3552.7690000000002
Brandon's for schema and all that all

3549.049 --> 3554.119
the time yeah I'll just maybe I'll be

3552.769 --> 3555.1299999999997
there as an I can I'll just go do

3554.119 --> 3558.0190000000002
something else

3555.13 --> 3560.329
or I'll just leave and be like yeah I I

3558.019 --> 3562.7889999999998
don't I don't feel like going through

3560.329 --> 3565.549
this [ __ ] right now I don't want to hear

3562.789 --> 3570.19
another two hours of that [ __ ] that

3565.549 --> 3570.19
I knew every single detail off by now

3570.759 --> 3578.809
yeah and also I can't snipe anymore the

3576.68 --> 3582.41
system that Nathan is using now for the

3578.809 --> 3586.009
back panel I it doesn't have the snipe

3582.41 --> 3587.5989999999997
function I can't do it so if somebody's

3586.009 --> 3589.489
going to be in there and doing that

3587.599 --> 3591.849
there's nothing really I can do about it

3589.489 --> 3591.849
anymore

3613.56 --> 3618.14
yeah that's right gleam all of those

3616.26 --> 3621.21
characters all of them

3618.14 --> 3623.8199999999997
I've already seen Neil deGrasse Tyson in

3621.21 --> 3626.43
there and and Stephen Hawking's the

3623.82 --> 3630.06
other ones I don't even know what those

3626.43 --> 3633.87
supposed to be but yeah they're in there

3630.06 --> 3640.83
just cameos though and the funny thing

3633.87 --> 3643.83
was is they were they weren't yeah they

3640.83 --> 3647.19
were kind of being supposedly themselves

3643.83 --> 3650.5699999999997
in it so it was just cameos cameos with

3647.19 --> 3650.57
science people

3666.51 --> 3669.23
huh

3669.519 --> 3678.8289999999997
no not really over Mukul that's a gross

3673.539 --> 3683.2990000000004
overgeneralization fukushima did not

3678.829 --> 3686.15
cause germans energy policy okay they

3683.299 --> 3688.7
were already on to that for a long time

3686.15 --> 3690.7690000000002
they want they were one of the first

3688.7 --> 3693.109
yeah they really went into the green

3690.769 --> 3696.4399999999996
thing and made it possible for everybody

3693.109 --> 3698.15
to get solar panels to become more

3696.44 --> 3701.029
self-sufficient through that and all

3698.15 --> 3704.839
that and they put a lot of effort into

3701.029 --> 3708.529
it and they stepped away from nuclear

3704.839 --> 3710.72
power really because of just the

3708.529 --> 3713.989
pollution and the issues and all kinds

3710.72 --> 3717.22
of things but it wasn't because of

3713.989 --> 3722.9
Fukushima they went to that transition

3717.22 --> 3725.979
way before Fukushima happen probably a

3722.9 --> 3725.9790000000003
decade before that

3747.9 --> 3750.65
right

3756.72 --> 3760.6099999999997
hmm

3758.3 --> 3763.61
okay glad to hear that gaining wisdom

3760.61 --> 3766.55
and yeah the no topic thing it has its

3763.61 --> 3768.9500000000003
ups and it down in its downs but I'm

3766.55 --> 3772.46
look I have a show here every day now

3768.95 --> 3774.56
and if I just be feeling that show up

3772.46 --> 3777.29
with telling a story doing a

3774.56 --> 3780.92
presentation I'm gonna run out and

3777.29 --> 3782.8
become morbidly bored really quickly so

3780.92 --> 3786.6800000000003
this is just a way that I'm gonna do it

3782.8 --> 3789.0800000000004
I'm very good at improvising explaining

3786.68 --> 3792.2
things anyway so I just like to back up

3789.08 --> 3793.0699999999997
forth with the channel unless there is

3792.2 --> 3795.68
something

3793.07 --> 3798.0800000000004
oh really relevant and actual going on

3795.68 --> 3803.2999999999997
that I could treat as a subject and then

3798.08 --> 3804.83
I do that but yeah there's almost no

3803.3 --> 3807.8
subject out there that can make me

3804.83 --> 3811.0099999999998
literally feel our with improvised

3807.8 --> 3812.9300000000003
treating that subject it's just yeah

3811.01 --> 3817.3700000000003
that's not gonna work or rarely will

3812.93 --> 3821.21
anyway I'm gonna round out the show it

3817.37 --> 3825.43
was pretty good I think it's quite a lot

3821.21 --> 3825.43
of infighting subjects and all that I

3825.58 --> 3830.2999999999997
picked the topic of the day well that

3827.69 --> 3832.34
could be anything but picking a topic of

3830.3 --> 3836.1200000000003
the days doesn't mean that that's gonna

3832.34 --> 3838.07
work out if there is a topic that people

3836.12 --> 3840.7999999999997
want to really delve into they'll bring

3838.07 --> 3842.63
it up and if it works then I'll take

3840.8 --> 3843.92
that subject and then we'll do a back

3842.63 --> 3847.82
and forth that's how it works

3843.92 --> 3850.9700000000003
so anyway I hope to see you guys all

3847.82 --> 3853.3300000000004
back tomorrow again on the Saturday flat

3860.93 --> 3863.81
you haven't already subscribed to my

3862.28 --> 3865.82
