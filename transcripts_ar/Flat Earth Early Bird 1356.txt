95.2 --> 97.60000000000001
warm

99.52 --> 103.84
kind of same as yesterday although yeah

102.0 --> 106.88
a lot more wind

103.84 --> 109.92
which is very nice

106.88 --> 112.64
but yeah still trails have been done i

109.92 --> 114.72
noticed earlier and yeah you have this

112.64 --> 116.56
peculiar

114.72 --> 118.24
type of cloud formation over there can

116.56 --> 121.28
you see that

118.24 --> 121.28
it looks really weird

122.719 --> 126.83999999999999
i don't think the webcam

125.04 --> 129.84
can pick up the

126.84 --> 130.56
peculiarity that i'm seeing

129.84 --> 134.08
just

130.56 --> 134.08
very oddly shaped

136.239 --> 141.28
but yeah the sun's still coming through

139.52 --> 144.64000000000001
clear

141.28 --> 144.64000000000001
and it is kind of warm

145.76 --> 149.599
but yeah wind is blowing

151.04 --> 156.76
also everybody's home so i'm keeping my

153.44 --> 156.76
door closed

165.2 --> 170.76
hello pjcnet first in chat good to see

167.76 --> 170.76
you

171.519 --> 177.959
it is tuesday the 6th of september 2022

183.599 --> 187.83999999999997
let's see what kind of show we're gonna

185.2 --> 190.48
have today

187.84 --> 194.239
right well first of all

190.48 --> 197.04
went on jim bob's again yesterday

194.239 --> 199.519
we teamed up against the yeah

197.04 --> 201.44
like this distinct globe believing

199.519 --> 203.59900000000002
atheist guy

201.44 --> 205.28
who was trying to reapply space-time

203.599 --> 208.48
into being

205.28 --> 211.2
science and physically proven and all

208.48 --> 213.10999999999999
all kinds of weird hyper-speculative

211.2 --> 216.22899999999998
direction

213.11 --> 216.229
[Music]

231.28 --> 237.12
he was a vervant believer of

233.519 --> 237.12
science philosophy

238.959 --> 243.28
and yeah we had to basically put him in

240.959 --> 244.159
this place so i i went at it

243.28 --> 246.08
yeah

244.159 --> 248.72
grilling him over the scientific method

246.08 --> 250.87900000000002
and together with jim bob it was great

248.72 --> 252.159
although listening back to it and i did

250.879 --> 253.439
listen to

252.159 --> 256.239
like

253.439 --> 258.56
two-thirds of it

256.239 --> 260.4
yeah my sound did get cut out all the

258.56 --> 261.84
time like as soon as anybody else spoke

260.4 --> 262.79999999999995
it just kind of got muffled in the

261.84 --> 264.63899999999995
background that was kind of

262.8 --> 266.56
disappointing

264.639 --> 268.96000000000004
but other than that it was great it was

266.56 --> 270.88
a lot of fun and i did have a lot of

268.96 --> 273.19899999999996
well i was on camera so i could just

270.88 --> 275.04
give visual expression right i didn't

273.199 --> 277.04
even have to say anything a lot of the

275.04 --> 279.84000000000003
time

277.04 --> 279.84000000000003
but that was fun

281.36 --> 286.32
check it out

282.72 --> 288.24
the whole show was fun by the way but

286.32 --> 291.59999999999997
this one is time stamped to when i come

288.24 --> 291.6
in if you want to check it out

292.479 --> 296.96
sound is great here

294.4 --> 298.15999999999997
yeah no not on my own show on gym bobs i

296.96 --> 300.63899999999995
meant

298.16 --> 302.08000000000004
sound in there was just

300.639 --> 305.44
i kept

302.08 --> 305.44
being pushed to the background

306.4 --> 310.479
this is kind of disappointing

308.479 --> 313.28
in retrospect but yeah it was still fun

310.479 --> 313.28
to be on there

314.72 --> 318.44000000000005
i like doing that

324.96 --> 327.919
right yeah

326.08 --> 330.71999999999997
flat earth debate yesterday was also

327.919 --> 332.639
good but the after show lasted very

330.72 --> 335.28000000000003
short only half an hour and then nathan

332.639 --> 337.199
rounded out

335.28 --> 340.55999999999995
but we did hang out

337.199 --> 340.56
quite long afterward

342.4 --> 351.15999999999997
hey mike sadinick good to see you

345.759 --> 351.16
iron 26 good to see you too

364.5 --> 369.68
[Music]

367.44 --> 372.71999999999997
what

369.68 --> 372.72
talking about england

373.199 --> 378.47
oh is that is that so

375.68 --> 381.759
huh

378.47 --> 381.759
[Music]

382.88 --> 385.52
i didn't know

385.84 --> 389.0
i guess

403.52 --> 407.68
yeah boris johnson's back to toilet

405.6 --> 410.91900000000004
brush duty

407.68 --> 410.919
i guess

436.4 --> 440.31899999999996
right yeah pjc net yeah that's that's

438.96 --> 442.63899999999995
fair enough but

440.319 --> 444.319
look if you want to send

442.639 --> 446.319
the criminals in your government that

444.319 --> 448.319
are doing these things to jail you're

446.319 --> 449.68
gonna have to like sack the entire

448.319 --> 452.24
government

449.68 --> 453.52
because they're all in on it

452.24 --> 458.0
even if they

453.52 --> 458.0
in my opinion supposedly oppose it

459.599 --> 461.919
because

463.44 --> 468.879
just taking in a stance that is

466.24 --> 471.68
like popular doesn't automatically mean

468.879 --> 473.52000000000004
that you really are gonna push to do

471.68 --> 475.599
that

473.52 --> 476.96
if there's even talk of arrest like

475.599 --> 479.84
somewhere

476.96 --> 482.0
among politics there

479.84 --> 482.0
so

486.0 --> 490.199
they're just all in on it

492.879 --> 499.319
it's a big club and you ain't in it

496.319 --> 499.319
anyway

518.479 --> 521.479
and

535.519 --> 540.64
right but yeah over here there's also

537.92 --> 544.16
the [ __ ] still going and they're just

540.64 --> 546.48
the government is now the

544.16 --> 548.7199999999999
well economic forum people are now

546.48 --> 552.9590000000001
rolling out like oh yeah we need to

548.72 --> 552.9590000000001
prepare to go to food stamps

553.6 --> 557.839
like they're literally just

556.0 --> 563.32
pushing that like you need to prepare

557.839 --> 563.32
for that because they're wrecking it

563.36 --> 567.839
and they're just not taking the

564.56 --> 569.5189999999999
responsibility for it at all

567.839 --> 571.2790000000001
just saying oh like yeah we're yeah

569.519 --> 575.88
we're wrecking it and this is what

571.279 --> 575.88
you're gonna have to need to prepare for

576.72 --> 579.76
it's atrocious

582.0 --> 587.64
so yeah i hope that my

584.32 --> 592.48
minor call on my show for

587.64 --> 596.6
totalitarian civil resistance

592.48 --> 596.6
hope that that's going to be heard

608.8 --> 614.5999999999999
no screen frozen all right right thanks

611.12 --> 614.6
for telling me

634.8 --> 638.4799999999999
hey susie s good to see you

645.68 --> 650.079
have you succeeded in the download yet

654.399 --> 659.279
start back up the torrent

657.519 --> 662.32
because there was a lot of downloading

659.279 --> 662.32
activity going on

663.519 --> 666.8
but yeah

664.72 --> 669.6
don't know if you're all done yet or

666.8 --> 671.3599999999999
like how much how the speed is with the

669.6 --> 674.16
download of blueberry remember from

671.36 --> 676.5600000000001
yesterday

674.16 --> 676.56
anyway

677.6 --> 681.0
let me know

688.72 --> 694.0790000000001
oh you were watching this show before

691.839 --> 697.48
you were watching it before in my show

694.079 --> 697.4799999999999
yeah okay

702.399 --> 706.32
right

703.279 --> 709.12
so i guess you're gonna finish that up

706.32 --> 709.12
after i'm done

714.639 --> 718.16
it's great so far yeah i know

719.2 --> 723.36
and it's like that all the way it's not

721.2 --> 725.839
like oh the first part is like really

723.36 --> 727.44
awesome and then it turns to [ __ ] no no

725.839 --> 730.0
it's all

727.44 --> 732.8800000000001
pretty much like that

730.0 --> 732.88
very enjoyable

734.32 --> 736.639
anyway

738.959 --> 744.76
got up to when he goes back to town

741.76 --> 744.76
right

750.16 --> 755.36
yeah that's like one-third in

753.04 --> 755.36
about

755.44 --> 760.72
ever considering adding discord no

758.88 --> 762.959
but i do have a discord channel but i'm

760.72 --> 765.2
just not going to use it you see i don't

762.959 --> 767.92
want to make room for other people to

765.2 --> 771.519
just start blabbering over me

767.92 --> 773.92
because they want my show

771.519 --> 777.12
yeah if you have something to say you

773.92 --> 777.12
can just say it in chat

781.279 --> 786.639
and if i really really want somebody on

783.76 --> 789.6
the show then i will just

786.639 --> 791.6800000000001
get them on the show

789.6 --> 794.72
talking of which i think

791.68 --> 796.8
still oh seeking star wars show

794.72 --> 800.36
but then she had to unexpectedly move

796.8 --> 800.3599999999999
and all that so

803.519 --> 807.399
we'll see when that happens

818.48 --> 824.6800000000001
i presume food stamps happen

821.68 --> 824.68
no

828.16 --> 832.639
no we don't have food stamps professor

830.16 --> 832.639
phil bell

833.519 --> 838.639
and we yeah we don't use that no it was

836.079 --> 842.8389999999999
meant for the general public

838.639 --> 842.839
not just for poor people

856.48 --> 863.8000000000001
yeah that's it correct matthew hall

859.6 --> 863.8000000000001
oh there it goes again

889.199 --> 893.279
right so yeah what do you guys want to

891.12 --> 895.6
talk about i feel pretty good

893.279 --> 897.4399999999999
interesting by the way because got up

895.6 --> 900.639
it's really hot it felt kind of

897.44 --> 902.72
nauseated i had my supplements i had a

900.639 --> 905.6
illuminati croissant and was just like

902.72 --> 907.12
oh it's not feel good still

905.6 --> 908.48
it's not gonna be one of those days

907.12 --> 911.04
right

908.48 --> 914.0
and then i actually took another little

911.04 --> 918.48
scoop of eater food and it immediately

914.0 --> 918.48
went away so this is just like wow

920.399 --> 926.639
i feel pretty good but it is still hot

923.199 --> 931.519
and i did have kind of a late night

926.639 --> 931.519
i drank a coffee before going on gymbop

931.6 --> 936.16
and

933.04 --> 937.92
not super super too late but still late

936.16 --> 941.48
enough that it did kind of keep me up

937.92 --> 941.4799999999999
until three o'clock

942.8 --> 947.079
what still slept fine

958.079 --> 963.279
oh yeah thank you susie s no but don't

960.8 --> 966.279
worry too much though i i'm always like

963.279 --> 966.279
that

968.48 --> 972.0790000000001
it's just

969.92 --> 975.519
unfortunate side effect of being an

972.079 --> 977.519
empath you you tend to get sick quickly

975.519 --> 980.48
well

977.519 --> 982.8
like from stress

980.48 --> 982.8000000000001
and so

986.399 --> 991.6
i've been like that since

989.04 --> 993.8389999999999
since a little kid i think

991.6 --> 996.0790000000001
but i just was always like yeah i can

993.839 --> 998.399
get super mopey over the times i feel

996.079 --> 1000.959
sick or i could just be enjoy the times

998.399 --> 1004.079
that i don't feel sick and i

1000.959 --> 1006.3199999999999
like it's more

1004.079 --> 1006.3199999999999
right

1007.36 --> 1012.88
when i'm in the flow i got so much

1010.399 --> 1014.72
energy and ability available to me even

1012.88 --> 1017.519
as a very young kid that i was just

1014.72 --> 1019.6
always like okay just ignore the bad

1017.519 --> 1022.32
side and just enjoy the good side and

1019.6 --> 1022.32
build on that

1022.72 --> 1027.6000000000001
so you can imagine it took me quite a t

1024.88 --> 1028.64
some time before i could even

1027.6 --> 1031.4389999999999
admit

1028.64 --> 1033.679
that i even had like the bad side

1031.439 --> 1036.72
to the outside world because i was just

1033.679 --> 1036.72
trying to ignore it

1037.439 --> 1041.6000000000001
all right although yeah you can't ignore

1039.839 --> 1043.6
it too much because

1041.6 --> 1045.9189999999999
you just start having terrible food

1043.6 --> 1048.0
habits and just shoving

1045.919 --> 1050.48
toxic candy down your throat you're

1048.0 --> 1052.88
gonna get sick even quicker and

1050.48 --> 1055.1200000000001
so

1052.88 --> 1055.1200000000001
right

1059.44 --> 1064.679
yeah yeah matthew hall how are you doing

1061.36 --> 1064.6789999999999
by the way

1069.44 --> 1073.44
i remember you having an issue with like

1072.0 --> 1076.0
a pet

1073.44 --> 1076.0
your dog

1077.28 --> 1080.8799999999999
that that's like a a week ago or

1079.84 --> 1083.78
something

1080.88 --> 1086.95
how are you now

1083.78 --> 1086.95
[Music]

1103.039 --> 1108.559
all right but anyway yeah the inner

1105.039 --> 1110.72
foods working out great for me

1108.559 --> 1113.44
and again i think it's just so funny

1110.72 --> 1115.1200000000001
that i just i had that stuff for like 10

1113.44 --> 1118.0800000000002
years

1115.12 --> 1121.799
and barely or pretty much never touched

1118.08 --> 1121.799
it in eight years

1127.28 --> 1129.6
hello

1135.039 --> 1137.84
hmm

1150.48 --> 1154.3600000000001
what are you talking about

1166.08 --> 1169.1999999999998
yeah good to hear matthew

1172.96 --> 1176.24
work you've got to work

1177.36 --> 1181.12
okay well go ahead then

1184.4 --> 1191.3200000000002
don't know why you needed to enter my

1186.48 --> 1191.32
chat saying that but yeah go ahead

1197.28 --> 1204.44
all right so yeah hello lva paul

1200.4 --> 1204.44
why not with the playmorphism

1205.6 --> 1210.3999999999999
somatic cycle no

1207.84 --> 1212.24
not really

1210.4 --> 1214.159
maybe if i understood the context i

1212.24 --> 1216.72
could probably

1214.159 --> 1219.2800000000002
say something about it but yeah just

1216.72 --> 1221.84
those words yeah they don't mean a whole

1219.28 --> 1221.84
lot to me

1222.48 --> 1227.44
although

1223.679 --> 1230.5590000000002
yeah pleo morpheus morphism i have heard

1227.44 --> 1230.559
the word before

1231.36 --> 1237.6789999999999
but that's about it

1235.28 --> 1239.84
i mean you could google it

1237.679 --> 1244.44
but why would i

1239.84 --> 1244.4399999999998
you just dumped it in my chat

1250.0 --> 1255.08
hey dank

1251.6 --> 1255.08
good to see you

1287.44 --> 1290.44
fluffy

1290.799 --> 1295.6
right so yeah

1292.72 --> 1299.1200000000001
want me to discuss anything

1295.6 --> 1300.799
did anybody see me on gymbops yesterday

1299.12 --> 1304.6
i linked that at the beginning of the

1300.799 --> 1304.6
show i could do it again

1329.039 --> 1333.84
oh so it's medical related you say

1334.559 --> 1339.52
okay then those words mean even less to

1337.36 --> 1341.4399999999998
me

1339.52 --> 1344.48
but hey yeah if it's anywhere in the

1341.44 --> 1347.8400000000001
direction of terrain theory

1344.48 --> 1347.84
then i'm all for it

1348.0 --> 1351.919
i mean

1348.96 --> 1354.64
you got to realize that like

1351.919 --> 1358.5590000000002
germ theory and virus theory

1354.64 --> 1359.679
haven't actually been provided proof

1358.559 --> 1362.24
right

1359.679 --> 1364.24
so every time somebody comes up with an

1362.24 --> 1365.36
alternative and like the ring theory

1364.24 --> 1368.32
related

1365.36 --> 1371.28
it's like oh this pro this proves

1368.32 --> 1373.6
the other theory no not really it's

1371.28 --> 1375.9189999999999
might it might be a more viable

1373.6 --> 1379.28
hypothesis

1375.919 --> 1381.3600000000001
but there was never a hypothesis

1379.28 --> 1385.12
actually done

1381.36 --> 1386.7199999999998
for virus theory like none at all

1385.12 --> 1390.0
and yeah

1386.72 --> 1392.96
there's a strong suspicion of fraud when

1390.0 --> 1397.64
it comes to the germ theory

1392.96 --> 1397.64
but anyway i'm just being nitpicky here

1403.84 --> 1407.6789999999999
they're not pathogens yes i agree

1408.64 --> 1412.48
right although look not all of it is

1411.52 --> 1413.6
good

1412.48 --> 1418.48
but

1413.6 --> 1419.6789999999999
we colonize it we colonize all those

1418.48 --> 1422.4
micro

1419.679 --> 1425.4
organisms

1422.4 --> 1425.4
right

1432.4 --> 1434.72
what

1436.48 --> 1439.48
oh

1442.0 --> 1448.44
[Music]

1445.44 --> 1448.44
ugh

1464.559 --> 1468.8799999999999
ah

1465.84 --> 1470.08
you mean quiet not quite

1468.88 --> 1472.5590000000002
that's fine

1470.08 --> 1475.36
right yeah yeah yeah welcome back

1472.559 --> 1475.36
matthew mitchell

1475.45 --> 1480.239
[Music]

1480.72 --> 1484.24
this is food yeah yeah yeah i know i

1483.2 --> 1486.64
know

1484.24 --> 1490.559
i but the funny thing is lvapo i've

1486.64 --> 1492.7990000000002
known that like since i was a little kid

1490.559 --> 1496.24
and that's how it my parents told me

1492.799 --> 1498.1589999999999
even like yeah when meat

1496.24 --> 1501.1200000000001
gets too old

1498.159 --> 1503.2
it gets toxic because of the bacteria

1501.12 --> 1506.6399999999999
that are just like

1503.2 --> 1508.0800000000002
chewing on it inside

1506.64 --> 1510.4
that's how we learn it's like yeah the

1508.08 --> 1512.559
toxins come from the bacteria and i even

1510.4 --> 1513.3600000000001
heard like yeah how do you deal with

1512.559 --> 1516.32
like

1513.36 --> 1518.1589999999999
chicken that might be on the risk factor

1516.32 --> 1518.96
i don't know by the way don't take this

1518.159 --> 1520.96
tip

1518.96 --> 1523.3600000000001
from me directly this is just something

1520.96 --> 1524.159
i heard back then that i can tie in with

1523.36 --> 1526.24
this

1524.159 --> 1528.72
it's like yeah if you chicken and it

1526.24 --> 1531.6
might be over dead just wash it if it

1528.72 --> 1533.84
smells weird just wash it with water

1531.6 --> 1535.12
until it doesn't smell so

1533.84 --> 1537.1999999999998
rancid

1535.12 --> 1539.9189999999999
and then you could probably still eat it

1537.2 --> 1542.0800000000002
without getting food poison that's

1539.919 --> 1544.48
right because that's what it always it's

1542.08 --> 1546.799
like yeah the toxins

1544.48 --> 1549.679
not the bacteria the bacteria in there

1546.799 --> 1551.52
are no problem at all it's when you just

1549.679 --> 1553.679
leave them chowing

1551.52 --> 1556.48
on the food

1553.679 --> 1559.5500000000002
and then they poop and that poop is

1556.48 --> 1562.74
actually the toxin

1559.55 --> 1562.74
[Music]

1565.679 --> 1571.2
here's the curry food yeah well that

1567.84 --> 1572.48
would probably work or

1571.2 --> 1574.96
look

1572.48 --> 1576.08
or how about just

1574.96 --> 1579.279
well

1576.08 --> 1581.279
just boil it really hard

1579.279 --> 1582.48
but the problem is you got to kind of

1581.279 --> 1584.559
wash it

1582.48 --> 1586.96
at least if you're not just gonna chug

1584.559 --> 1586.96
it away

1587.76 --> 1591.2
and then you could just like i don't

1589.84 --> 1594.24
know

1591.2 --> 1596.4
fry it or something

1594.24 --> 1598.88
make sure that every part of it actually

1596.4 --> 1601.44
gets heated properly

1598.88 --> 1604.3200000000002
right don't leave any chance to have

1601.44 --> 1606.0
some little bit of raw part right that

1604.32 --> 1608.48
would be my approach

1606.0 --> 1611.039
and if you don't wash it

1608.48 --> 1615.279
then all that bacteria poo is still like

1611.039 --> 1617.279
going to eventually dissolve in

1615.279 --> 1621.12
in it in the fat or something you're

1617.279 --> 1623.12
using and it's gonna like stay there

1621.12 --> 1626.2399999999998
right so unless you plan to like throw

1623.12 --> 1629.76
all the fat away afterwards

1626.24 --> 1629.76
it's better to just wash it

1631.44 --> 1635.3600000000001
anyway

1633.44 --> 1638.0800000000002
like giving really weird food tips for

1635.36 --> 1638.08
old meats but

1638.84 --> 1646.36
right the germs themselves are not scary

1642.96 --> 1646.3600000000001
it's the toxins

1662.24 --> 1665.44
seen a lot of people promoting eating

1663.84 --> 1669.12
raw meat

1665.44 --> 1671.8400000000001
yeah well pj cena look

1669.12 --> 1674.799
it could work

1671.84 --> 1676.0
if it's really fresh

1674.799 --> 1677.679
right

1676.0 --> 1680.08
problem is is that with typical

1677.679 --> 1682.88
store-bought meat even the organic ones

1680.08 --> 1686.48
although those tend to be a lot better

1682.88 --> 1686.48
they're not super fresh

1686.88 --> 1692.3990000000001
right you would like have to like get it

1689.52 --> 1694.08
straight off the slaughterhouse almost

1692.399 --> 1697.36
to eat it raw

1694.08 --> 1700.24
if i would ever consider going to such a

1697.36 --> 1701.6
diet which i don't have any plans to

1700.24 --> 1704.08
that's how i would do it i would

1701.6 --> 1706.87
definitely not just take store-bought

1704.08 --> 1709.9099999999999
meat and then eat it raw

1706.87 --> 1709.9099999999999
[Music]

1714.08 --> 1720.799
if i tried it with anything i would try

1716.799 --> 1722.6399999999999
it first with uh actual steak

1720.799 --> 1724.399
because steak is just

1722.64 --> 1726.7990000000002
it is really

1724.399 --> 1729.279
a unique type of meat that you could

1726.799 --> 1730.8799999999999
almost literally eat raw it

1729.279 --> 1733.52
it doesn't even

1730.88 --> 1736.5200000000002
taste weird

1733.52 --> 1736.52
anyway

1739.919 --> 1745.3600000000001
red blood cells can morph into bacterium

1742.24 --> 1745.36
back fascinating

1745.679 --> 1751.039
well i do know that their bacteria have

1747.84 --> 1754.72
all kinds of bizarre cycles

1751.039 --> 1756.279
like even if they get like attacked

1754.72 --> 1759.2
that they just like

1756.279 --> 1761.039
metamorphize into some kind of spore or

1759.2 --> 1764.0
something and that the spore is

1761.039 --> 1766.64
absolutely indestructible

1764.0 --> 1769.279
and then at other conditions can make it

1766.64 --> 1771.919
turn back into a bacteria fascinating

1769.279 --> 1775.12
stuff i mean the microbiology in the

1771.919 --> 1775.1200000000001
body is just like

1776.24 --> 1782.64
dude

1778.48 --> 1782.64
so extensive it's just insane

1783.2 --> 1787.1200000000001
it's like the the

1785.2 --> 1789.2
micro world

1787.12 --> 1792.08
of biology is like

1789.2 --> 1794.0800000000002
more complex than the macro world

1792.08 --> 1796.6399999999999
that's what it feels like to me it's

1794.08 --> 1797.36
just more complicated more extensive

1796.64 --> 1801.3600000000001
it's

1797.36 --> 1803.6
and more organized which is even crazier

1801.36 --> 1805.9189999999999
but uh

1803.6 --> 1805.9189999999999
yeah

1806.64 --> 1810.3200000000002
eating raw chicken eel

1814.96 --> 1821.64
hey the new pad files and gadget

1817.279 --> 1821.64
inspector not dark yet

1822.08 --> 1825.279
would it have to be fresh

1827.919 --> 1834.6000000000001
because i guess

1830.0 --> 1834.6
your body would assimilate it better

1836.32 --> 1839.4399999999998
because it is

1839.919 --> 1844.96
still somewhat alive

1843.12 --> 1845.9189999999999
i mean meat

1844.96 --> 1847.2
like

1845.919 --> 1851.44
yeah it's not

1847.2 --> 1854.159
driven anymore by it by the sentience

1851.44 --> 1855.76
by a nerve system but it is still like

1854.159 --> 1857.6000000000001
living matter

1855.76 --> 1861.039
until you heat it and then yeah

1857.6 --> 1861.039
definitely dies in that moment

1861.12 --> 1866.7199999999998
but if you just wait long it's still

1863.6 --> 1869.84
slowly dying also yeah bacteria poop

1866.72 --> 1869.84
build up so

1873.76 --> 1879.1589999999999
that's why it would have to be fresh not

1875.84 --> 1879.1589999999999
dark yet

1880.88 --> 1886.64
is there a difference between age meat

1882.96 --> 1886.64
and free yeah i just told you

1890.32 --> 1896.399
fresh meat is still alive aged meat not

1893.919 --> 1898.64
alive

1896.399 --> 1901.1999999999998
either you eat it when it's really fresh

1898.64 --> 1903.44
or you have to like process it i guess

1901.2 --> 1906.32
through heat or something

1903.44 --> 1909.679
i mean you could like sun dry meat as

1906.32 --> 1912.96
well right old tradition

1909.679 --> 1912.96
beef jerky and all that

1918.159 --> 1921.8400000000001
what point does it die there's no

1919.84 --> 1924.799
specific point it's not an on and off

1921.84 --> 1927.799
switch it's not a one and a zero it's a

1924.799 --> 1927.799
transition

1937.36 --> 1942.4799999999998
right when it comes to microbiology

1940.48 --> 1945.279
there's not just a simple on and off

1942.48 --> 1946.72
switch there's like multiple layers and

1945.279 --> 1950.399
then a whole

1946.72 --> 1953.919
staircase from fully alive to dead

1950.399 --> 1956.799
and that staircase is literally even

1953.919 --> 1959.3600000000001
during being alive because the staircase

1956.799 --> 1961.679
just keeps going you can be barely alive

1959.36 --> 1963.12
up until like fully

1961.679 --> 1965.2
efficient

1963.12 --> 1969.279
right

1965.2 --> 1972.0800000000002
living being alive is really a gradient

1969.279 --> 1976.2
when you look into the microbiological

1972.08 --> 1976.1999999999998
it's not that oversimplifiable

1981.679 --> 1985.3200000000002
anyway in my opinion

1992.399 --> 1997.6789999999999
some

1993.519 --> 1997.679
fish raw right yeah like sushi

1998.08 --> 2003.4399999999998
i mean if you can eat raw fish if it's

2000.88 --> 2005.679
very fresh too i mean the japanese do it

2003.44 --> 2009.1200000000001
all the time all kinds of asian

2005.679 --> 2009.1200000000001
cultures do that by the way

2010.799 --> 2017.24
but

2011.6 --> 2017.24
they know it has to be super fresh

2022.0 --> 2025.0
right

2054.079 --> 2058.32
raw lamb

2055.599 --> 2061.2000000000003
what susias

2058.32 --> 2064.159
uh

2061.2 --> 2064.1589999999997
don't know about that

2065.28 --> 2071.44
well i don't like lamb in general

2068.159 --> 2071.44
i don't like the taste of it

2071.679 --> 2075.599
but ross

2073.52 --> 2078.48
okay

2075.599 --> 2081.28
no but i'm not a raw meat fan or

2078.48 --> 2087.0
anything i i know it's out there i know

2081.28 --> 2087.0
it it works i just don't like it

2100.64 --> 2103.96
[ __ ] god

2128.4 --> 2133.119
i do not appreciate your dumb

2130.8 --> 2135.599
pranks of something that somebody said

2133.119 --> 2136.96
supposedly out there dude that that's

2135.599 --> 2139.04
been done like

2136.96 --> 2142.4
50 times or something

2139.04 --> 2144.56
i don't care it's not funny

2142.4 --> 2147.2000000000003
either you do it and then you show a

2144.56 --> 2149.359
video of it or shut the [ __ ] up and stop

2147.2 --> 2151.2799999999997
making up stupid [ __ ] about me that

2149.359 --> 2152.64
supposedly happens out there which

2151.28 --> 2155.2000000000003
doesn't

2152.64 --> 2155.2
stop it

2157.119 --> 2161.88
don't have patience for that nonsense

2158.88 --> 2161.88
anymore

2165.63 --> 2168.829
[Music]

2173.68 --> 2180.68
which it did my voice last night really

2177.68 --> 2180.68
wow

2190.56 --> 2196.7999999999997
he did

2191.92 --> 2196.8
a live yes yes gadget inspector

2196.88 --> 2203.28
he did a live i'm sure he did a live

2201.119 --> 2208.119
can you please just

2203.28 --> 2208.119
type coherent sentences thank you

2227.28 --> 2232.5600000000004
okay so he did a troll stream against me

2229.839 --> 2235.2799999999997
wow i guess i really really got to him

2232.56 --> 2237.92
when i called him gay and said that they

2235.28 --> 2240.96
don't debate [ __ ]

2237.92 --> 2243.52
which i stand behind

2240.96 --> 2244.8
when you act like a [ __ ] like he did

2243.52 --> 2246.4
in the chat

2244.8 --> 2249.119
on ball busters

2246.4 --> 2250.88
yeah then i start talking to you like

2249.119 --> 2252.0
that

2250.88 --> 2254.8
i mean

2252.0 --> 2257.76
i'd rather have

2254.8 --> 2261.2000000000003
a live show together with rumpus than

2257.76 --> 2261.2000000000003
with wits it at this point

2262.32 --> 2266.88
because i know with rumpus at least i'm

2264.8 --> 2267.8390000000004
gonna get some funny moments out of it

2266.88 --> 2272.7200000000003
that are

2267.839 --> 2272.72
interesting and mutually beneficial

2279.28 --> 2283.3590000000004
you did

2280.88 --> 2285.839
not just chew my name okay so he named

2283.359 --> 2289.44
me a list of baddies did he so he's gone

2285.839 --> 2289.44
full savage mode as he

2289.599 --> 2296.3590000000004
which it gets it's the next

2292.4 --> 2296.359
right the hand is he

2306.0 --> 2309.839
so okay last question about this

2308.56 --> 2313.04
nonsense

2309.839 --> 2317.04
he said he did my voice right

2313.04 --> 2317.04
did it sound anything like me

2322.0 --> 2327.599
like anything at all

2324.64 --> 2329.2
or did he just think he was smart saying

2327.599 --> 2330.7200000000003
repeating something that i would

2329.2 --> 2332.64
typically say

2330.72 --> 2334.0
not sounding like me

2332.64 --> 2336.3199999999997
because

2334.0 --> 2337.68
the way i speak is not that easy to

2336.32 --> 2341.3590000000004
emulate

2337.68 --> 2344.0789999999997
it really is not

2341.359 --> 2347.7999999999997
it's hard enough to just point pinpoint

2344.079 --> 2347.8
point it down so

2361.359 --> 2364.48
wow

2362.32 --> 2366.079
oh that's lame then i mean if you're

2364.48 --> 2368.4
gonna try to

2366.079 --> 2372.6400000000003
do my voice then you can at least try

2368.4 --> 2374.96
this make it somewhat sound like me

2372.64 --> 2374.96
uh

2376.96 --> 2380.0
like

2377.68 --> 2381.7599999999998
if i couldn't properly emulate a voice

2380.0 --> 2383.359
of somebody or i didn't want to would

2381.76 --> 2386.0
because it would make me feel gay

2383.359 --> 2389.7599999999998
because their voice is gay

2386.0 --> 2389.76
then i typically don't do it

2389.92 --> 2393.44
because i'm not that desperate

2393.76 --> 2397.7200000000003
i have my own show

2413.119 --> 2419.1600000000003
the hammers perfect it follows the video

2416.16 --> 2419.16
okay

2423.79 --> 2428.4
[Music]

2426.319 --> 2430.48
you want to talk more calmly about the

2428.4 --> 2432.96
ether well you can talk

2430.48 --> 2435.68
calmly about it all you want as long as

2432.96 --> 2437.28
you realize it's an aberration it's not

2435.68 --> 2439.5989999999997
scientific

2437.28 --> 2442.079
there's actually nothing about it really

2439.599 --> 2442.079
proven

2442.24 --> 2446.72
it's just an aberration

2445.28 --> 2448.96
and

2446.72 --> 2452.24
a whole bunch of different things that

2448.96 --> 2454.8
have absolutely no relation no direct

2452.24 --> 2454.7999999999997
relation

2455.04 --> 2459.7599999999998
completely different feels all tied in

2457.44 --> 2462.0
together because of some

2459.76 --> 2464.079
suggestion of a pattern

2462.0 --> 2466.56
just like gravity

2464.079 --> 2468.6400000000003
the other aberration

2466.56 --> 2470.56
you can talk about it all you like as

2468.64 --> 2472.64
long as you don't start to reify

2470.56 --> 2476.72
anything about it

2472.64 --> 2479.68
problem is that's what ethereans do

2476.72 --> 2482.24
they worship the ether

2479.68 --> 2484.64
they declare it god they declare it to

2482.24 --> 2487.359
be all that is

2484.64 --> 2489.5989999999997
where there is nothing god

2487.359 --> 2492.24
the creator they make it into that they

2489.599 --> 2495.119
worship it they reify it

2492.24 --> 2497.7599999999998
and they attempt to replace the creator

2495.119 --> 2502.6400000000003
in my opinion it is

2497.76 --> 2502.6400000000003
like an intellectual form of idolatry

2503.359 --> 2509.52
which is typically what aberrations lead

2506.0 --> 2511.76
to by the way they'd always end up doing

2509.52 --> 2511.7599999999998
that

2519.04 --> 2523.839
neither are electrons and photons though

2527.359 --> 2532.96
but it depends on what about it

2530.64 --> 2534.64
i mean photons just a

2532.96 --> 2536.48
quanta

2534.64 --> 2537.7599999999998
it's not a

2536.48 --> 2540.56
yeah not a

2537.76 --> 2542.7200000000003
border down particle right but there's

2540.56 --> 2547.359
more testing to be done i mean

2542.72 --> 2547.359
not all research has actually been done

2548.4 --> 2553.359
i've conceived of tests

2551.359 --> 2554.64
that could further the understanding of

2553.359 --> 2556.48
light

2554.64 --> 2558.4
laid them down many times i'm not gonna

2556.48 --> 2560.48
keep repeating that on my show like a

2558.4 --> 2561.839
thousand times

2560.48 --> 2566.4
but

2561.839 --> 2566.4
maybe like a hundred times this

2572.079 --> 2577.76
right so yeah electrons

2574.4 --> 2579.359
and even photons work just fine as a

2577.76 --> 2581.2000000000003
convention

2579.359 --> 2584.88
problem is that when you start to

2581.2 --> 2588.16
approach photons like they are atoms

2584.88 --> 2589.52
start to reify them into exa being the

2588.16 --> 2591.2799999999997
same thing

2589.52 --> 2593.92
that's when you run into the actual

2591.28 --> 2596.1600000000003
problems that's where you start to reify

2593.92 --> 2596.16
so

2596.24 --> 2600.72
nature of light is just not fully

2598.4 --> 2602.96
understood and

2600.72 --> 2604.3999999999996
a lot of its mechanisms

2602.96 --> 2606.56
have been

2604.4 --> 2609.04
described

2606.56 --> 2610.48
through wave abilities

2609.04 --> 2615.04
which is

2610.48 --> 2615.04
wrong like that's not actually correct

2615.2 --> 2618.319
really

2616.24 --> 2621.839
it's no proof that any of those things

2618.319 --> 2621.839
frequency spectrum

2622.96 --> 2625.839
oscillation

2626.079 --> 2630.079
all these things

2627.68 --> 2632.16
that there's actual

2630.079 --> 2634.88
waves involved

2632.16 --> 2637.5989999999997
but they just use those words for the

2634.88 --> 2641.0
foundation of the descriptions of light

2637.599 --> 2641.0
and its abilities

2653.04 --> 2657.599
what can we what the [ __ ] are you

2654.72 --> 2657.5989999999997
talking about then

2658.48 --> 2665.359
autoelectric effect yeah that's cute

2661.119 --> 2666.7200000000003
photoelectric effect does not prove

2665.359 --> 2668.4
that light

2666.72 --> 2671.359
has a exact

2668.4 --> 2673.6800000000003
minimal size

2671.359 --> 2676.48
it just proves that there is

2673.68 --> 2679.2799999999997
a physical reaction caused by light and

2676.48 --> 2682.319
a photon is the quanta

2679.28 --> 2684.88
that is required the minimum quanta in

2682.319 --> 2687.119
order to trigger the photoelectric

2684.88 --> 2689.119
reaction

2687.119 --> 2692.7200000000003
that does not prove that light

2689.119 --> 2692.7200000000003
cannot be smaller than that

2693.839 --> 2699.7999999999997
that's part of my

2696.079 --> 2699.8
theory about it

2713.04 --> 2715.2
[ __ ] dude

2714.4 --> 2717.6800000000003
just

2715.2 --> 2717.68
stop

2717.839 --> 2720.64
just stop

2726.64 --> 2730.24
not really about either more interested

2728.72 --> 2732.24
in the link between linda yeah yeah

2730.24 --> 2733.9199999999996
that's the whole point that's what

2732.24 --> 2735.9199999999996
ethereans do

2733.92 --> 2737.92
they think it's all connected they think

2735.92 --> 2741.92
it's all one thing

2737.92 --> 2746.7200000000003
that's the point of ether

2741.92 --> 2749.76
it is the virtual unifier of all things

2746.72 --> 2754.16
the ultimate reification

2749.76 --> 2757.28
that's where the whole [ __ ] show started

2754.16 --> 2760.0
by trying to mend

2757.28 --> 2763.76
the the gaps between all these

2760.0 --> 2763.76
fundamentally different things

2772.72 --> 2775.839
hey jedo good to see you

2789.119 --> 2791.44
what

2795.599 --> 2800.839
okay judo i don't know what you're

2797.2 --> 2800.839
talking about though

2805.599 --> 2808.8
all right but hey if you want to talk

2807.599 --> 2810.48
about that

2808.8 --> 2811.8390000000004
then just do that on the flat earth

2810.48 --> 2814.319
debates

2811.839 --> 2814.319
you know

2815.52 --> 2822.079
although you yeah now you probably get

2818.96 --> 2822.079
a lot of resistance

2823.119 --> 2827.76
it's just that look all this free

2825.599 --> 2828.56
speculation of ether

2827.76 --> 2832.2400000000002
i

2828.56 --> 2833.68
guarantee you is completely a waste of

2832.24 --> 2835.9199999999996
time

2833.68 --> 2838.319
it's not going to lead to anything if it

2835.92 --> 2841.599
would have it would have happened a

2838.319 --> 2843.68
hundred years ago

2841.599 --> 2848.1600000000003
it didn't

2843.68 --> 2850.7999999999997
because there is only dead ends

2848.16 --> 2852.0
it's an aberration it doesn't actually

2850.8 --> 2855.599
yield

2852.0 --> 2859.8
it just sends you on an endless journey

2855.599 --> 2859.8
that never amounts to anything

2890.559 --> 2894.7200000000003
wage is just a way to describe

2895.28 --> 2899.559
yes matthew mitchell

2900.48 --> 2905.04
although it is

2903.2 --> 2906.72
basically misleading

2905.04 --> 2909.2799999999997
but that's what it is that's what they

2906.72 --> 2910.319
did they described everything about life

2909.28 --> 2911.92
using the

2910.319 --> 2914.8
lingo

2911.92 --> 2916.88
of waves

2914.8 --> 2919.599
that it is in the way

2916.88 --> 2922.4
it's just another micro attribute that

2919.599 --> 2926.559
they didn't know how else to classify

2922.4 --> 2928.079
that's why it's all been wave mechanized

2926.559 --> 2931.28
because they just didn't know how to

2928.079 --> 2934.599
freaking classify it in a different way

2931.28 --> 2934.599
at the time

2948.48 --> 2952.96
all right yeah pjc net

2950.64 --> 2952.96
look

2954.48 --> 2962.8
it's just the same type of nonsense [ __ ]

2958.96 --> 2965.359
it's the whole dielectric incoherent

2962.8 --> 2967.8390000000004
acceleration nonsense it's the same type

2965.359 --> 2967.839
of [ __ ]

2968.72 --> 2974.64
same process they're just like how dare

2971.28 --> 2976.1600000000003
you oh you're strumming me

2974.64 --> 2978.4
you know you don't know what the [ __ ]

2976.16 --> 2980.48
you're talking about

2978.4 --> 2982.839
you're just writing science fiction

2980.48 --> 2985.44
using established lingo

2982.839 --> 2987.92
incorrectly and then you say we're straw

2985.44 --> 2990.64
manning you no that's just called

2987.92 --> 2994.839
incoherent fantasizing

2990.64 --> 2994.839
that is just sowing confusion

3016.24 --> 3020.16
tesla's very interesting yes i know

3018.16 --> 3022.5589999999997
tesla is very interesting

3020.16 --> 3027.24
he was also wise enough never to start

3022.559 --> 3027.2400000000002
claiming a hypothesis for ether

3027.599 --> 3033.839
but yes he too

3029.76 --> 3038.2400000000002
bumped into the aberration of the ether

3033.839 --> 3038.24
as a lot of scientists have

3038.48 --> 3044.119
for over a hundred years that's why i

3040.96 --> 3044.119
say that

3064.4 --> 3068.839
get some fresh air cook in here

3085.599 --> 3091.7200000000003
oh there's a nice little cloud in front

3087.599 --> 3091.7200000000003
of that sun right now

3129.92 --> 3135.119
right yeah that's right lva paul it's

3132.24 --> 3138.72
just a diffraction pattern it's the way

3135.119 --> 3141.119
it's splitting up

3138.72 --> 3144.9599999999996
so you could say that the diffraction

3141.119 --> 3147.359
has sort of a wavy like influence

3144.96 --> 3149.359
but isn't that even that would be unwise

3147.359 --> 3151.44
to call it that because there is

3149.359 --> 3152.5589999999997
actually no wave going on it's all just

3151.44 --> 3154.079
beams

3152.559 --> 3155.52
all of it

3154.079 --> 3158.559
and the way

3155.52 --> 3161.2
infinitely divisible beam splits up

3158.559 --> 3163.52
becomes constant more concentrated or

3161.2 --> 3164.72
concentrated enough

3163.52 --> 3168.24
for there

3164.72 --> 3172.0
to form well quanta

3168.24 --> 3174.319
amounts of light on the other side

3172.0 --> 3177.44
in the very division that causes the

3174.319 --> 3177.44
diffraction pattern

3177.92 --> 3181.28
the wave function

3179.68 --> 3184.96
right

3181.28 --> 3188.48
it's all just straight lines doing that

3184.96 --> 3191.359
i mean you could technically

3188.48 --> 3193.52
take a light from a double slit

3191.359 --> 3195.04
right that goes out in a pattern like

3193.52 --> 3197.2
that

3195.04 --> 3199.119
install it in a specific position and

3197.2 --> 3202.24
then right behind it

3199.119 --> 3204.559
take like pillars and stick them right

3202.24 --> 3206.8799999999997
in between

3204.559 --> 3208.4
the the voids

3206.88 --> 3210.6400000000003
right the voids

3208.4 --> 3213.2000000000003
of the beams that you know are going to

3210.64 --> 3214.8799999999997
end up there right you can do that well

3213.2 --> 3217.359
if you do it too close to it then there

3214.88 --> 3218.6400000000003
might be some diffraction it might split

3217.359 --> 3219.44
up even more

3218.64 --> 3221.2
but

3219.44 --> 3222.559
if you just put it in between there

3221.2 --> 3226.16
they're just going to go straight

3222.559 --> 3228.48
through without any difference visually

3226.16 --> 3233.1189999999997
you see because they're all straight

3228.48 --> 3233.119
lines there is no wave no wave

3233.359 --> 3236.72
straight lines

3234.8 --> 3239.52
light is all straight lines

3236.72 --> 3242.48
just changes angle sometimes due to

3239.52 --> 3244.96
diffraction over fraction

3242.48 --> 3248.319
by changing

3244.96 --> 3252.16
or passing through into another

3248.319 --> 3253.68
a completely different type of medium

3252.16 --> 3255.44
like water

3253.68 --> 3258.24
and air or

3255.44 --> 3260.64
air in glass

3258.24 --> 3262.0
and then the angle changes upon entering

3260.64 --> 3264.7999999999997
the new medium

3262.0 --> 3267.44
but after the entry point it doesn't

3264.8 --> 3269.6800000000003
keep changing it just changes the angle

3267.44 --> 3271.52
in one way and then goes in straight

3269.68 --> 3276.2799999999997
line on from there

3271.52 --> 3276.28
because it's all straight lines beams

3287.2 --> 3291.359
why does the angle change between

3288.88 --> 3291.359
mediums

3291.44 --> 3296.2400000000002
because that's what happens

3293.52 --> 3298.24
it's they call it refraction

3296.24 --> 3299.4399999999996
it's what happens

3298.24 --> 3302.0789999999997
why

3299.44 --> 3304.799
because that's what happens

3302.079 --> 3306.559
i mean why does water boil

3304.799 --> 3309.52
when you heat it up

3306.559 --> 3309.52
because it does

3310.0 --> 3314.4
it keeps happening

3311.599 --> 3317.52
it can be described it can be predicted

3314.4 --> 3319.52
exactly how and how much

3317.52 --> 3320.88
well the same thing goes for

3319.52 --> 3323.68
refraction

3320.88 --> 3326.079
it's been tested it's it's been indexed

3323.68 --> 3328.5589999999997
literally it's called the refraction

3326.079 --> 3328.559
index

3331.04 --> 3335.2799999999997
right

3332.24 --> 3338.319
it's been quantified how much the angle

3335.28 --> 3341.119
will change depending on

3338.319 --> 3342.96
the different mediums it might transit

3341.119 --> 3345.2000000000003
how much is it going to change it's a

3342.96 --> 3349.28
calculable that's why

3345.2 --> 3350.799
realistic 3d ray tracing programs

3349.28 --> 3352.559
actually work

3350.799 --> 3355.28
why they can

3352.559 --> 3357.599
manipulate even transparent materials

3355.28 --> 3361.2000000000003
and make it look really real because

3357.599 --> 3365.52
they have a refraction index

3361.2 --> 3368.48
factor calculated in the rendering

3365.52 --> 3371.599
it's very easy to have light

3368.48 --> 3374.16
enter a plane a light ray in this case a

3371.599 --> 3378.319
ray in the ray tracing system a plane is

3374.16 --> 3380.0
just a polygon and a polygon then

3378.319 --> 3383.2
says to

3380.0 --> 3385.2
the situation beyond this point this is

3383.2 --> 3389.2
how much refraction index this is how

3385.2 --> 3391.4399999999996
much transparency you're going to reveal

3389.2 --> 3393.5989999999997
and then the ray continues on with those

3391.44 --> 3396.319
parameters like as if the entire

3393.599 --> 3397.2000000000003
material was solid like that's

3396.319 --> 3400.079
how

3397.2 --> 3401.839
it works i've seen it i've literally

3400.079 --> 3403.599
like tested it

3401.839 --> 3407.2799999999997
myself

3403.599 --> 3409.119
with freaking old 90s computers that

3407.28 --> 3412.079
would take me like

3409.119 --> 3415.52
an hour minimum to even calculate a

3412.079 --> 3415.52
singular ray trace picture

3415.76 --> 3420.7990000000004
i tested it that's what it is

3418.96 --> 3425.3
that's how how it works

3420.799 --> 3427.44
it's fascinating i used imagine 3d

3425.3 --> 3428.7200000000003
[Music]

3427.44 --> 3430.88
yeah that's like

3428.72 --> 3434.9599999999996
i think that

3430.88 --> 3438.079
babylon 5 graphics were actually made

3434.96 --> 3438.079
with imagine 3d

3438.88 --> 3442.0
which were by the way astounding for the

3441.04 --> 3444.799
time

3442.0 --> 3444.799
really awesome

3445.359 --> 3449.68
i mean it's nothing like what we got now

3447.44 --> 3449.68
but

3450.88 --> 3455.119
still

3452.72 --> 3455.1189999999997
anyway

3456.079 --> 3461.44
it's nerds no expensive speed and light

3459.28 --> 3462.48
yes yes so what's the measured speed of

3461.44 --> 3464.799
light

3462.48 --> 3466.319
can you give me a quote

3464.799 --> 3467.599
on the

3466.319 --> 3470.16
one-way

3467.599 --> 3473.44
speed of light measurement

3470.16 --> 3474.96
not a calculation not a derivation but a

3473.44 --> 3475.76
measurement as in

3474.96 --> 3478.2400000000002
you

3475.76 --> 3479.3590000000004
actually detect it and you measure the

3478.24 --> 3481.68
speed

3479.359 --> 3483.2
can you give me any data on that not

3481.68 --> 3485.839
dark yet

3483.2 --> 3489.5589999999997
before you shove in snell's law with

3485.839 --> 3489.5589999999997
speed of light reification

3500.88 --> 3503.839
and don't call me paul

3506.0 --> 3510.0
my name is arwyn online

3513.68 --> 3518.16
i'm just saying what snell's law is

3515.599 --> 3519.04
based on yeah just like kepler's laws

3518.16 --> 3521.5989999999997
right

3519.04 --> 3523.52
you know what kepler's laws are based on

3521.599 --> 3526.6400000000003
yeah yeah yeah

3523.52 --> 3530.24
yeah on reification

3526.64 --> 3532.4
oh okay you were addressing elvis fine

3530.24 --> 3535.3999999999996
i'm having a conversation with you now

3532.4 --> 3535.4
so

3548.079 --> 3552.0
imagine 3d was originally for the amiga

3550.799 --> 3555.96
i know

3552.0 --> 3555.96
i had it on my amiga

3558.559 --> 3565.0400000000004
guess what the first thing i was doing

3561.44 --> 3567.599
on imagine 3d on my amiga

3565.04 --> 3569.7599999999998
making a spaceship

3567.599 --> 3574.2400000000002
of course

3569.76 --> 3574.2400000000002
i still literally have like the 3d

3574.319 --> 3578.799
model for it on paper

3576.24 --> 3582.359
of what i made

3578.799 --> 3582.359
still have that

3601.599 --> 3605.119
i was

3602.559 --> 3606.96
asking you to explain why yeah and i

3605.119 --> 3611.6400000000003
said i don't know why it's just what it

3606.96 --> 3611.64
does why would i know that

3612.54 --> 3618.24
[Music]

3615.359 --> 3621.119
why would i know why light changes

3618.24 --> 3623.4399999999996
angles between mediums i just know it

3621.119 --> 3623.44
does

3623.599 --> 3628.48
yeah and my infinitely divisible

3626.16 --> 3631.5989999999997
instantaneous beam

3628.48 --> 3634.079
conception of light works absolutely

3631.599 --> 3637.079
perfectly with that there's no issues

3634.079 --> 3637.079
whatsoever

3653.68 --> 3659.839
thanks for your for giving an honest

3655.92 --> 3659.839
answer yeah but the point is

3660.64 --> 3664.48
if there was an answer to this don't you

3663.04 --> 3668.2799999999997
think it would be

3664.48 --> 3668.28
out there and confirmed

3671.28 --> 3673.52
right

3679.119 --> 3682.6400000000003
right like you can't

3683.28 --> 3688.0
it's just an establishment of

3686.24 --> 3690.0
an effect

3688.0 --> 3691.92
you can very manipulate it within

3690.0 --> 3694.079
science by literally changing the

3691.92 --> 3697.2000000000003
refraction index

3694.079 --> 3700.799
but that will only show you

3697.2 --> 3703.52
the phenomenon which is refraction

3700.799 --> 3704.72
altering because of the refraction index

3703.52 --> 3706.72
that you're manipulating as the

3704.72 --> 3709.52
experimenter but that doesn't actually

3706.72 --> 3712.0789999999997
explain to you why that happens it just

3709.52 --> 3714.24
shows you that it happens and how it

3712.079 --> 3717.599
happens

3714.24 --> 3720.319
what thing is causing the effect the

3717.599 --> 3725.6400000000003
phenomenon

3720.319 --> 3725.64
it doesn't tell you why it does that

3726.0 --> 3730.799
that's not really what science is about

3735.839 --> 3740.0
it's just established a cause of an

3738.24 --> 3741.4399999999996
effect

3740.0 --> 3742.559
and

3741.44 --> 3745.599
what is

3742.559 --> 3746.6400000000003
on on the side

3745.599 --> 3748.1600000000003
right

3746.64 --> 3750.72
why

3748.16 --> 3755.799
why is it like that

3750.72 --> 3755.799
because that's not a that's not physics

3761.28 --> 3763.92
right

3762.16 --> 3765.68
you could go in all directions with that

3763.92 --> 3767.44
but it's all going to be philosophy

3765.68 --> 3770.0
because this is just like this is how it

3767.44 --> 3772.2400000000002
works why does it work like that

3770.0 --> 3774.24
because that's how it works it's like

3772.24 --> 3776.799
why entropy

3774.24 --> 3779.0389999999998
well that's what happens

3776.799 --> 3783.0
yeah but why does it happen

3779.039 --> 3783.0
because that's what happens

3798.48 --> 3804.2400000000002
the relative change in speed of light no

3802.079 --> 3807.119
there is no measured speed of light and

3804.24 --> 3810.4799999999996
there's no alteration of this

3807.119 --> 3814.559
claimed to be speed of light this is all

3810.48 --> 3816.72
virtual blabber mouthing nonsense

3814.559 --> 3818.559
you could say oh look it has a speed oh

3816.72 --> 3821.0389999999998
look we're changing the speed and that's

3818.559 --> 3822.96
changing the light it's all virtual

3821.039 --> 3824.96
nonsense there is no speed of light

3822.96 --> 3827.599
there's no measurement of this no

3824.96 --> 3829.76
physical proof so somebody just claims

3827.599 --> 3831.44
it has a speed oh look the speed is

3829.76 --> 3832.7990000000004
changing and that's changing the light

3831.44 --> 3834.0
it's just all

3832.799 --> 3835.839
virtual

3834.0 --> 3837.52
nonsense

3835.839 --> 3839.359
all of it

3837.52 --> 3842.0
it's basically mathematical

3839.359 --> 3845.0
extrapolation based on presuppositions

3842.0 --> 3845.0
again

3866.799 --> 3869.52
right anyway if you're appreciating my

3868.72 --> 3871.9199999999996
show

3869.52 --> 3873.44
you like what i do then please consider

3871.92 --> 3875.76
supporting me

3873.44 --> 3878.88
with paypal mostly

3875.76 --> 3881.28
patreon is also welcome

3878.88 --> 3883.119
because

3881.28 --> 3885.6800000000003
yeah i do need

3883.119 --> 3887.359
some extra on the side income just to

3885.68 --> 3889.68
get by and

3887.359 --> 3892.5589999999997
stay fed

3889.68 --> 3895.52
as in food

3892.559 --> 3898.079
so yeah please donate to my paypal keep

3895.52 --> 3898.079
me going

3898.16 --> 3900.64
this is

3901.839 --> 3906.5589999999997
the demand i must make in order to do

3904.079 --> 3909.3590000000004
what i do

3906.559 --> 3911.76
don't particularly like it if i just had

3909.359 --> 3914.0
a stable income and all the time in the

3911.76 --> 3915.6800000000003
world then i would just do this without

3914.0 --> 3919.119
ever complaining about money

3915.68 --> 3920.839
unfortunately i'm not in that package

3919.119 --> 3924.319
so i just have to

3920.839 --> 3926.96
ask and i hope that my activities will

3924.319 --> 3926.96
be worth it

3928.4 --> 3932.1600000000003
do my best

3929.92 --> 3934.319
that includes participation in other

3932.16 --> 3937.839
shows like the flat earth debates

3934.319 --> 3937.839
and made by jim bob

3938.0 --> 3945.119
i really appreciate that he has me on

3941.68 --> 3949.16
it's great i really like doing that

3945.119 --> 3949.1600000000003
when i have the energy for it

3950.72 --> 3956.64
you agree with me but wonder what kiwi

3953.119 --> 3956.6400000000003
would say about what

3957.839 --> 3962.4
i don't think you'd disagree with

3959.52 --> 3962.4
anything i just said

3963.599 --> 3969.44
except maybe that the the infinitely

3966.319 --> 3971.7599999999998
divisible beam is just my own idea of

3969.44 --> 3973.92
light

3971.76 --> 3975.8390000000004
right but i technically even got the

3973.92 --> 3978.079
conception of photon correct i

3975.839 --> 3980.0789999999997
understand that convention it's just

3978.079 --> 3982.7200000000003
that there are so many misconceptions

3980.079 --> 3982.7200000000003
about it

3983.52 --> 3987.52
like that it is like a

3985.599 --> 3989.3590000000004
molecule or an atom or something it

3987.52 --> 3992.0
isn't

3989.359 --> 3993.52
it's a quanta the contact can be less

3992.0 --> 3996.24
it's just then

3993.52 --> 3999.839
how will the matter that you're using to

3996.24 --> 4002.0
register it how will it register when

3999.839 --> 4003.839
when it's not enough to trigger that

4002.0 --> 4007.119
actual photoelectric effect which

4003.839 --> 4010.799
happens in the material which presumed

4007.119 --> 4013.119
to be has a finite size

4010.799 --> 4016.24
and therefore requires a very specific

4013.119 --> 4019.039
amount of energy threshold which would

4016.24 --> 4021.2799999999997
be that quanta of light

4019.039 --> 4024.0
well there's other ways to test whether

4021.28 --> 4026.7200000000003
that quantified you truly is the

4024.0 --> 4028.64
smallest unit

4026.72 --> 4030.64
because i don't think it is and i've

4028.64 --> 4031.52
laid that down even for qe and i think

4030.64 --> 4035.44
that he

4031.52 --> 4037.28
he kind of does respect it

4035.44 --> 4039.28
but he's just like yeah just show the

4037.28 --> 4041.28
experiment already just where's the

4039.28 --> 4045.3590000000004
experiment do it then he's like yeah

4041.28 --> 4047.6800000000003
thanks kiwi i don't have millions

4045.359 --> 4051.2
available to me to just get to argon

4047.68 --> 4051.2
pump lasers and just do it

4055.68 --> 4060.2799999999997
but if i did then i could

4066.24 --> 4071.68
it reifies light into particles yeah but

4068.559 --> 4075.52
only for convenience of

4071.68 --> 4077.44
the material that is learned godzilla

4075.52 --> 4078.61
it's only for the convenience of quantum

4077.44 --> 4081.9790000000003
mechanics

4078.61 --> 4081.9790000000003
[Music]

4082.64 --> 4087.92
but it technically there is no necessity

4086.72 --> 4092.72
to even

4087.92 --> 4092.7200000000003
assume light is particles

4093.039 --> 4102.2390000000005
especially because he knows kiwi knows

4098.799 --> 4106.319
that light doesn't have a speed

4102.239 --> 4109.12
and therefore the idea of particles

4106.319 --> 4111.120000000001
is kind of like

4109.12 --> 4114.12
it doesn't make sense anyway he knows

4111.12 --> 4114.12
that

4118.0 --> 4121.679
he's just like

4119.199 --> 4124.48
he doesn't really know how to maneuver

4121.679 --> 4126.96
his way through that so he just doesn't

4124.48 --> 4126.959999999999
go there

4130.799 --> 4135.6
contest the smallest they have detected

4132.719 --> 4137.92
so maybe not a particle then yeah i

4135.6 --> 4140.319
don't think light is a particle

4137.92 --> 4143.4400000000005
i think it is infinitely divisible in

4140.319 --> 4144.56
nature and it is instantaneous has no

4143.44 --> 4147.919999999999
speed

4144.56 --> 4150.4800000000005
and i would describe it

4147.92 --> 4151.4400000000005
not as a wave not as a particle like

4150.48 --> 4155.199
matter

4151.44 --> 4155.199
i would describe it as a beam

4157.04 --> 4162.0
i would say ray but ray is a

4159.04 --> 4164.0
mathematical construct like a line which

4162.0 --> 4166.719
is a

4164.0 --> 4168.719
one-dimensional construct would be array

4166.719 --> 4169.92
that cannot exist

4168.719 --> 4172.96
it's never

4169.92 --> 4175.6
like just a one-dimensional line that

4172.96 --> 4178.719
that's not what light is

4175.6 --> 4181.6
in any circumstance

4178.719 --> 4183.04
so a beam would be the best solution for

4181.6 --> 4186.08
a description

4183.04 --> 4186.08
yeah in my opinion

4187.04 --> 4190.719
does time

4188.799 --> 4192.08
have a speed what the [ __ ] are you

4190.719 --> 4194.4
talking about

4192.08 --> 4197.84
so that's another nonsense comment dude

4194.4 --> 4200.0
are you freaking high again

4197.84 --> 4202.32
it's a second nonsense comments you

4200.0 --> 4205.32
you've posted here dusty grapples

4202.32 --> 4205.32
whatever

4230.0 --> 4234.32
right yes matthew i'm glad you enjoyed

4232.719 --> 4236.159
it

4234.32 --> 4238.159
it's been very technical today i like

4236.159 --> 4242.36
that

4238.159 --> 4242.36
i hope you're enjoying it as well

4245.199 --> 4248.639999999999
hello mark sherry

4256.719 --> 4261.52
oh my god

4258.72 --> 4265.6
[Music]

4261.52 --> 4270.2390000000005
no lva pole that's incorrect

4265.6 --> 4273.52
quantum mechanics does rule out either

4270.239 --> 4276.08
it does there's no reason for ether to

4273.52 --> 4276.080000000001
be there

4276.88 --> 4283.28
it's specifically incorrect

4280.48 --> 4284.5599999999995
the entire nonsense

4283.28 --> 4288.5599999999995
of

4284.56 --> 4291.92
ether came out of the misinterpretation

4288.56 --> 4295.1990000000005
of the wave function of light that was

4291.92 --> 4300.04
discovered in quantum mechanics

4295.199 --> 4303.46
i mean you're exactly wrong

4300.04 --> 4303.46
[Music]

4310.0 --> 4316.08
and why the hell would anybody dismiss

4312.239 --> 4316.08
quantum mechanics it is what it is

4317.04 --> 4322.56
the test results were the test results

4320.0 --> 4324.719
they figured out what they did now all

4322.56 --> 4327.6
their conclusions

4324.719 --> 4330.4800000000005
could still be disputed right because

4327.6 --> 4333.360000000001
the conclusions from the data

4330.48 --> 4337.36
that is where misconceptions typically

4333.36 --> 4339.5199999999995
leak in based on the contemporary views

4337.36 --> 4341.679
that drove the people

4339.52 --> 4344.64
that were doing that right they have to

4341.679 --> 4347.12
model it in their mind

4344.64 --> 4349.280000000001
somehow they have to quantify it somehow

4347.12 --> 4352.5199999999995
as to what they're trying to figure out

4349.28 --> 4352.5199999999995
that's contemporary

4361.52 --> 4365.360000000001
right

4362.96 --> 4367.36
but yeah i think that a lot of weird

4365.36 --> 4369.199
conclusions also came out of quantum

4367.36 --> 4372.48
mechanics

4369.199 --> 4374.879999999999
with wild speculations based on very

4372.48 --> 4376.159
rigid more mathematical approaches of

4374.88 --> 4378.08
some of the

4376.159 --> 4379.92
things that they were testing

4378.08 --> 4381.04
but i think that that is more science

4379.92 --> 4383.12
fiction like

4381.04 --> 4386.719
the most predominant example of that

4383.12 --> 4386.719
would be the reification of

4386.8 --> 4391.52
what is it quantum entanglement and like

4390.0 --> 4392.32
oh there's

4391.52 --> 4394.8
a

4392.32 --> 4395.599999999999
light is a particle and then it splits

4394.8 --> 4397.360000000001
up

4395.6 --> 4398.8
and it is in the particle and then it

4397.36 --> 4401.5199999999995
comes back together and then it's a

4398.8 --> 4407.04
particle again right those are the types

4401.52 --> 4407.040000000001
of re interpretations and i say [ __ ]

4407.199 --> 4411.759999999999
[ __ ]

4408.56 --> 4415.120000000001
total horseshit science fiction nonsense

4411.76 --> 4416.08
thinking einstein [ __ ]

4415.12 --> 4418.64
yeah

4416.08 --> 4422.159
that doesn't mean that the physical

4418.64 --> 4425.6
experiments that were performed

4422.159 --> 4428.0
were not real they did what they did the

4425.6 --> 4430.320000000001
results were the results and there's a

4428.0 --> 4431.199
lot to be learned from that

4430.32 --> 4433.599999999999
and

4431.199 --> 4437.12
potentially a great place to even

4433.6 --> 4439.280000000001
revisit with new angles of approach new

4437.12 --> 4442.719
ideas no over

4439.28 --> 4444.5599999999995
arching ideas to figure out like hey

4442.719 --> 4447.199
maybe there's another way to interpret

4444.56 --> 4447.1990000000005
this data

4452.159 --> 4457.12
quantum field theories cosmo yes exactly

4455.199 --> 4459.199
exactly

4457.12 --> 4463.04
quantum field theory is cosmology

4459.199 --> 4463.04
nonsense you are correct lva paul

4466.239 --> 4472.48
see so

4469.679 --> 4475.6
if you just go by the actual experiments

4472.48 --> 4477.28
the physical demonstrations and all that

4475.6 --> 4478.400000000001
look at what they did look at how they

4477.28 --> 4480.5599999999995
did it

4478.4 --> 4482.879999999999
there's lot you can learn it's just that

4480.56 --> 4485.84
there's been a lot of theoretical

4482.88 --> 4486.719
nonsense that came dripping out of all

4485.84 --> 4488.88
that

4486.719 --> 4491.44
it was all so popular i said oh look

4488.88 --> 4493.12
it's it's a quantum

4491.44 --> 4495.5199999999995
it's a quantum

4493.12 --> 4498.64
quantum it's so that means it's super

4495.52 --> 4499.4400000000005
advanced and special and all magical

4498.64 --> 4501.4400000000005
looks

4499.44 --> 4504.719
things can be at two places at the same

4501.44 --> 4508.5599999999995
time it must be quantum

4504.719 --> 4511.12
nonsense absolute science fiction horse

4508.56 --> 4515.2390000000005
[ __ ]

4511.12 --> 4515.239
that's what came out of it too

4519.04 --> 4522.35
[Music]

4536.48 --> 4538.718999999999
right

4537.84 --> 4541.96
anyway

4538.719 --> 4541.96
hey kevlar

4556.32 --> 4560.239
yeah

4557.679 --> 4562.159
snell's law is she

4560.239 --> 4565.199
it's based on the presupposition that

4562.159 --> 4568.0
there has no proof

4565.199 --> 4571.759999999999
light speed never measured you can't

4568.0 --> 4571.76
measure it it's instantaneous

4572.48 --> 4578.5599999999995
those there's even arguments about like

4575.44 --> 4582.4
one way speed of light two-way speed of

4578.56 --> 4585.76
light it's so far down the drain guys

4582.4 --> 4589.28
this speed of light nonsense

4585.76 --> 4589.280000000001
it's so far down the drain

4589.29 --> 4595.92
[Music]

4593.84 --> 4598.159000000001
did i ever see the guy again from the

4595.92 --> 4600.64
church no i haven't seen him

4598.159 --> 4602.32
gadget inspector

4600.64 --> 4606.280000000001
then again i haven't really made a lot

4602.32 --> 4606.28
of walks out there

4614.32 --> 4620.159
can we mention snell's law no speed like

4617.04 --> 4622.719
yeah i don't know why man dude look i am

4620.159 --> 4625.759999999999
not like qe's handler or anything i

4622.719 --> 4627.84
don't know why he does things

4625.76 --> 4630.64
sometimes okay

4627.84 --> 4634.88
and i am assuming that he is very much

4630.64 --> 4637.6
still capable of making mistakes

4634.88 --> 4639.52
so i don't know man

4637.6 --> 4642.84
he might have said that

4639.52 --> 4642.84
i don't know

4654.48 --> 4659.36
i'm pretty sure kiwi is still learning

4658.4 --> 4661.12
he was

4659.36 --> 4662.88
way ahead

4661.12 --> 4665.599999999999
of most of us

4662.88 --> 4669.6
but he is still learning if he wasn't

4665.6 --> 4669.6
now then there would be a problem

4671.679 --> 4674.96
but kiwi is

4673.28 --> 4676.639999999999
still learning

4674.96 --> 4678.8
so

4676.64 --> 4681.52
right

4678.8 --> 4684.64
i mean maybe kiwi will eventually even

4681.52 --> 4684.64
just like kind of

4684.8 --> 4689.84
drop his position

4687.28 --> 4692.4
on well the reification of light into a

4689.84 --> 4694.719
literal particle like that

4692.4 --> 4697.839999999999
even though he has a lot of writing work

4694.719 --> 4700.0
to reference if he wants to do that

4697.84 --> 4702.0
but i think that he will probably drop

4700.0 --> 4705.4
it when he just realized that it is just

4702.0 --> 4705.4
old conjecture

4713.28 --> 4718.28
okay hello tara 306 what

4728.56 --> 4732.280000000001

though i mean we have that one

4743.36 --> 4749.28
photograph that we assume is him

4746.88 --> 4750.8
the way that looks that's probably him

4749.28 --> 4753.92
when he was like

4750.8 --> 4753.92
20 or something

4754.08 --> 4758.48
i mean he's not going to be looking like

4756.32 --> 4763.5599999999995

it was him

really diddy now gadget inspector

4803.52 --> 4809.159000000001

4822.639 --> 4826.159000000001

rompers

4828.719 --> 4831.719
dude

4834.239 --> 4839.5199999999995
i can't believe it i didn't realize that

4836.8 --> 4842.400000000001
rumpus would actually meet somebody in

4839.52 --> 4846.159000000001
person that he would go there

4842.4 --> 4847.92
wow i am astounded i had not expected

4846.159 --> 4850.96
that i thought he was gonna like remain

4847.92 --> 4850.96
anonymous forever

4853.6 --> 4857.52
cool well what does it look like

4859.52 --> 4864.2390000000005

4861.28 --> 4864.239
kind of curious now

4870.159 --> 4875.0

4872.0 --> 4875.0
um

4879.44 --> 4883.5199999999995
i don't think uh rumpus is overall very

4881.84 --> 4888.12
good with ladies

4883.52 --> 4888.120000000001
i mean his voice is really annoying

4890.32 --> 4896.639
it looks like a malnourished what okay

4894.32 --> 4900.0
so he isn't fat okay i thought it would

4896.639 --> 4900.0
be fat or something huh

4900.48 --> 4903.199

4922.0 --> 4926.48
yeah but yeah susie if you want to learn

4924.48 --> 4928.638999999999
something about rumpus then go to

4926.48 --> 4930.4
quantum erasers channel and

4928.639 --> 4933.28
like dig into the old

4930.4 --> 4936.96
rumpus numpty clips

4933.28 --> 4936.96
i think there should be some of those

4940.48 --> 4946.0
i mean rumpus just has this really

4944.199 --> 4950.48
patronizing

4946.0 --> 4950.48
wannabe high society british voice

4951.84 --> 4956.32
it's just

4953.52 --> 4958.8
yeah it is just rumpus i don't exactly

4956.32 --> 4963.28
know how to how to describe it but it is

4958.8 --> 4963.28
a very specific type of way of speaking

4965.5 --> 4969.92

4966.96 --> 4972.2390000000005

perfect story until you just kind of

4974.8 --> 4978.400000000001
start to like oh but i'm actually going

4976.719 --> 4979.84
to hold you to what you're saying and

4978.4 --> 4981.5199999999995
then you're like

4979.84 --> 4984.2390000000005

5024.88 --> 5028.1990000000005

ew

5157.36 --> 5159.759999999999

okay

5165.199 --> 5171.44
okay i'm gonna regret asking this kevlar

5167.92 --> 5172.92
but does bev actually enjoy brenda doing

5171.44 --> 5176.599999999999
that

5172.92 --> 5176.6
[Music]

5187.52 --> 5190.52

5215.76 --> 5218.08
wow so

5217.28 --> 5219.92
bev

5218.08 --> 5222.239
i thought like maybe bev is like a

5219.92 --> 5224.08
weirdo that would actually enjoy that

5222.239 --> 5225.199
because this weirdo narcissist or

5224.08 --> 5226.719
whatever

5225.199 --> 5227.839999999999
but i guess

5226.719 --> 5229.679
then

5227.84 --> 5233.04
that brenda is just

5229.679 --> 5235.36
sexually harassing him

5233.04 --> 5235.36
what

5236.0 --> 5241.52
yeah no [ __ ] she's brand up oh she's

5238.48 --> 5241.5199999999995
messed up yeah

that's a tactic you use that's just

5251.84 --> 5254.32
[ __ ] up

5254.4 --> 5260.599999999999
brenda is such a scumbag

5270.88 --> 5275.04
unbelievable like where doesn't she go

5278.0 --> 5282.48

i don't want to think about it i just

5285.44 --> 5291.12
don't care just want to get rid of it

5288.56 --> 5292.400000000001
so just call it her i don't care if it's

really he

5292.4 --> 5295.839999999999

5299.36 --> 5305.759999999999
anything it always ends up in just some

5302.239 --> 5308.32
atrocity it just says something really

if he wants to

5367.199 --> 5370.719
right there's no respect

5369.84 --> 5373.1990000000005
for

science

5373.199 --> 5377.32
arguments anything

against the black swan argument which is

5386.239 --> 5390.48
ridiculous

5388.239 --> 5394.839999999999
there's no logical reason to even do

of the early bird show i even had brenda

5550.8 --> 5557.4800000000005

you're not dynamic you don't adapt

6188.159 --> 6193.92
you're ego driven you're driven

6190.639 --> 6196.08
by your own longing of the contemporary

6193.92 --> 6198.56
situation

6196.08 --> 6199.36
you don't have any cohesion on the long

6198.56 --> 6202.159000000001
run

6199.36 --> 6204.32
you contradict yourself constantly

6202.159 --> 6207.839999999999
and then just brush over it like it's

6204.32 --> 6211.5599999999995
your right to be self-contradicting

6207.84 --> 6211.56
bev is ridiculous

6222.639 --> 6228.56
oh water level test wow

6225.199 --> 6231.5599999999995

6228.56 --> 6231.56
yes

6235.84 --> 6240.4800000000005
yes you're driven by your own ego

6238.88 --> 6243.84
whether you're going to agree with

6240.48 --> 6247.44
something and then spend a year

6243.84 --> 6249.52
on blabbering on incoherently about your

6247.44 --> 6251.839999999999
reason why you disagree with something

6249.52 --> 6253.92
when there's absolutely no [ __ ] good

6251.84 --> 6257.28
reason for you to ever have done that in

6253.92 --> 6259.76
the first instance but no no you can't

6257.28 --> 6262.639
agree with the black swan no let's

6259.76 --> 6265.280000000001
blabber on endlessly about how you don't

6262.639 --> 6267.04
[ __ ] understand the thing about it

6265.28 --> 6268.88
yeah

6267.04 --> 6271.679
what's ego yeah that thing that you

6268.88 --> 6272.719

6271.679 --> 6274.56
thing

6272.719 --> 6278.52
that thing that you are

6274.56 --> 6278.52

i find bev extremely

excruciatingly annoying

6360.719 --> 6367.199
i find the impulses that drive him

6364.28 --> 6371.5199999999995
excruciatingly annoying i think that he

6367.199 --> 6373.919999999999
is a self-imposed hipster

6371.52 --> 6375.92
that thinks he's super special because

6373.92 --> 6377.76
he can do everything his own way by

6375.92 --> 6379.36
ignoring everything else and getting

6377.76 --> 6381.6

correcting himself

6381.6 --> 6384.8

6384.8 --> 6389.4400000000005

stop

6485.92 --> 6491.76
nagging me with your [ __ ]

6488.4 --> 6495.759999999999

6539.52 --> 6543.84
had to rebut that

6541.199 --> 6545.599999999999
until apparently it became so important

6543.84 --> 6547.76
that you would have to just do it
