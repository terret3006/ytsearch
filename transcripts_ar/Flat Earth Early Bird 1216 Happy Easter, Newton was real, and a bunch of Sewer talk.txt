the most beautiful I've seen thus far

104.22 --> 108.119
this year

106.38 --> 110.33999999999999
yeah

108.119 --> 113.64
No Doubt

110.34 --> 115.57900000000001
it's the most blossomy sunny

113.64 --> 121.399
Blue Sky

115.579 --> 121.399
beautiful Easter day that I can remember

122.159 --> 127.07900000000001
pretty much universally

124.92 --> 129.84
it's yeah it could have been perfectly

127.079 --> 132.239
blue but there's obvious that there are

129.84 --> 135.20000000000002
Trail remnants still hanging there I

132.239 --> 135.20000000000002
don't see anything

135.54 --> 142.379
currently though there are some planes

139.44 --> 144.85999999999999
they're over there in the distance

142.379 --> 147.66
right there

144.86 --> 152.16000000000003
and two over there but they're not

147.66 --> 154.2
leaving trails that don't dissipate

152.16 --> 157.019
so whatever has been sprayed has been

154.2 --> 159.0
sprayed probably a lot earlier

157.019 --> 161.239
right now there's nothing really being

159.0 --> 161.239
done

161.94 --> 167.879
it's really an amazing day

165.239 --> 169.739
amazing

167.879 --> 172.94
and on top of that

169.739 --> 172.94
I feel great

179.34 --> 184.8
static almost

181.8 --> 184.8
huh

185.519 --> 192.86
hello Jeff gashead Matthew Hall

189.36 --> 192.86
Jeff gassad first in chat

193.86 --> 203.12
it is Sunday the 17th of April 2022

200.28 --> 203.12
Easter day

204.72 --> 209.04
and yeah

206.76 --> 211.98
I thought

209.04 --> 215.35999999999999
it was small time

211.98 --> 215.35999999999999
ritual enactment

216.239 --> 219.92000000000002
breaking the croissant

220.799 --> 229.019
and drinking the blood orange juice

226.22 --> 232.099
both to remember Christ

229.019 --> 232.09900000000002
as he told us

232.14 --> 238.57999999999998
so cheers everybody

234.739 --> 238.58
to health and Christ

244.68 --> 249.42000000000002
I love that stuff

247.98 --> 251.879
um

249.42 --> 255.23899999999998
no it's going to be messy

251.879 --> 256.739
whatever maybe actual bread would have

255.239 --> 260.16
been better

256.739 --> 261.239
but hey I eat so

260.16 --> 263.72
um

261.239 --> 263.71999999999997
cheers

277.62 --> 282.979
so this morning I was delighted to find

280.44 --> 282.979
out that

284.1 --> 289.74
the

285.86 --> 292.68
abscess has pretty much become

289.74 --> 294.72
like it yeah

292.68 --> 296.759
it's pretty much over it's just now

294.72 --> 299.96000000000004
there's there doesn't seem to be any

296.759 --> 299.96000000000004
more real inflammation

301.68 --> 304.34000000000003
and

304.56 --> 309.919
yeah it's nothing like it was yesterday

306.419 --> 309.919
in the two days before that

310.139 --> 316.919
it like my cheek is still a bit

314.16 --> 319.68
uh like swollen but it's I think it's

316.919 --> 321.65999999999997
mostly just uh

319.68 --> 323.28000000000003
just lymph

321.66 --> 326.03900000000004
juices

323.28 --> 328.5
still there probably can't just massage

326.039 --> 330.36
it away in the next couple of days but

328.5 --> 332.699
it's just like oh my God it's finally

330.36 --> 335.639
over I can eat again I actually ate

332.699 --> 337.259
broccoli chicken yesterday night in the

335.639 --> 339.539
night

337.259 --> 342.90000000000003
it really hit the spot

339.539 --> 344.94
no I don't watch football sleeping

342.9 --> 347.78
Warrior

344.94 --> 347.78
oh

352.86 --> 356.539
happy Easter to you too

357.06 --> 360.5
and welcome to the chat

366.06 --> 368.419
oh

375.84 --> 378.79999999999995
I'm okay

379.319 --> 382.1
uh

382.199 --> 387.0
every time somebody from England does

384.6 --> 390.91900000000004
that starts talking about football I

387.0 --> 390.919
just have to think of the I.T crowd

391.38 --> 397.639
you see that Ludacris ludicrous display

394.919 --> 397.639
last night

399.419 --> 404.639
what was he thinking

401.639 --> 404.639
sorry

405.0 --> 409.5
because

407.039 --> 411.419
I'm just really not into football like

409.5 --> 413.22
that I mean I like watching football

411.419 --> 414.539
games especially when it's kind of

413.22 --> 417.78000000000003
tournament

414.539 --> 420.36
prominent things but

417.78 --> 421.979
anything other than that it's just like

420.36 --> 423.90000000000003
oh

421.979 --> 426.62
I just don't have the patience for it

423.9 --> 426.62
I'm not interested

434.58 --> 440.52
but I guess it was a a great enjoyable

437.58 --> 443.84
game for you so yeah happy about that

440.52 --> 443.84
glad you enjoyed it

445.68 --> 451.759
a seeking star water good to see you

447.66 --> 451.759
also by the way pjc net

460.259 --> 467.78000000000003
I love my British accent

463.62 --> 467.78000000000003
you love my British accent

476.58 --> 479.9
well I've had a lot of practice

480.06 --> 483.06
and then a lot of examples to basically

482.099 --> 486.539
take

483.06 --> 489.0
details from I mean I got like a wide

486.539 --> 493.02
range of British people that I'd talk

489.0 --> 496.139
with on like a higher technical level on

493.02 --> 498.479
a daily basis now for years

496.139 --> 501.78000000000003
it's the best English teacher I could

498.479 --> 505.37899999999996
have ever wished for like that situation

501.78 --> 509.69899999999996
I'm learning so much about English

505.379 --> 512.4590000000001
it's like subconsciously you see because

509.699 --> 514.5
instead of having a basic reference

512.459 --> 516.5989999999999
frame to reflect upon like oh that's

514.5 --> 518.94
English no I got a whole range so it

516.599 --> 522.12
suddenly becomes much more of a chiseled

518.94 --> 524.6400000000001
clear image and start to distinguish

522.12 --> 527.82
like why this accent there why that

524.64 --> 530.88
there like what is this spirit

527.82 --> 533.22
I'm just learning so much on a spiritual

530.88 --> 534.66
level about English like that and the

533.22 --> 537.74
English people

534.66 --> 537.74
how it works

540.72 --> 545.64
of course it also helped that

543.36 --> 547.38
like Monty Python

545.64 --> 549.899
and all that

547.38 --> 552.98
that really helped me a lot just being

549.899 --> 556.16
very interested in in British language

552.98 --> 556.16
in general

556.44 --> 561.12
especially the Holy Grail

558.54 --> 562.8299999999999
at the time it's just like wildly

561.12 --> 563.94
popular

562.83 --> 567.32
[Music]

563.94 --> 567.32
here in the Netherlands too

569.58 --> 573.2
among my circles anyway

587.399 --> 589.519
um

591.959 --> 598.9799999999999
yeah yeah I agree pjc net the whole

594.86 --> 602.24
internationalization has kind of made it

598.98 --> 602.24
more corporate

603.18 --> 607.88
right but it it all depends though you

605.519 --> 607.88
know because

608.88 --> 613.32
if that is what the people want you know

611.76 --> 617.279
but there are countries that have

613.32 --> 620.6400000000001
football clubs that are like really just

617.279 --> 623.82
have people from their country

620.64 --> 625.079
and they don't get Outsiders in that

623.82 --> 627.779
would kind of like

625.079 --> 630.14
disrupt the cohesion the spirit of what

627.779 --> 630.14
they do

630.779 --> 636.72
right but yeah it's freaking England

634.56 --> 639.18
like

636.72 --> 642.6
like yeah

639.18 --> 645.06
you know what's going down there

642.6 --> 647.88
so of course they're just always going

645.06 --> 650.579
to try to draw an international players

647.88 --> 654.86
from everywhere

650.579 --> 654.8599999999999
with some vague connection to England

665.22 --> 669.5
full of evil signs what

689.1 --> 693.48
I

690.42 --> 696.24
how is it full of evil signs Jeff gas

693.48 --> 697.019
had I mean there is of course like the

696.24 --> 699.62
in

697.019 --> 699.62
typical

699.72 --> 705.1800000000001
typical symbols

702.48 --> 707.519
five rings with Olympics and all that

705.18 --> 710.399
and I don't know yeah there's all kinds

707.519 --> 713.22
of symbols with International Sports

710.399 --> 717.899
but just in the sport itself during the

713.22 --> 720.12
game what what is it Jeff gashead

717.899 --> 721.98
don't just put down something like that

720.12 --> 724.38
and then just

721.98 --> 727.339
stop talking about it

724.38 --> 727.3389999999999
inform us

740.779 --> 745.459
okay so you can stop order no problem

743.1 --> 745.4590000000001
yeah

745.74 --> 752.6
your tarot handbook you're working on

748.68 --> 752.5999999999999
that and that's epic cool man

755.76 --> 760.1
in the symbols not the what

761.76 --> 764.66
was not the game

768.18 --> 773.399
right but but why is that evil why are

771.42 --> 776.16
you automatically assuming that those

773.399 --> 778.86
symbols are evil

776.16 --> 781.92
right why are symbols evil just because

778.86 --> 785.12
evil people end up using them

781.92 --> 785.12
ever thought of that

866.279 --> 869.12
what

872.399 --> 876.92
I'm sorry Jeff guess that you seem to be

874.92 --> 880.74
in like a really

876.92 --> 883.04
Brody mood or something I I don't see it

880.74 --> 883.04
at all

885.24 --> 890.3
I don't I disagree

887.16 --> 890.3
it's just a game

898.62 --> 903.72
I mean there are some weird qualities to

901.26 --> 907.98
the game you know

903.72 --> 911.279
I mean you keep focusing on a ball

907.98 --> 914.339
I realize that that by watching the game

911.279 --> 916.32
people are all focusing on the ball

914.339 --> 917.1
what the ball is doing the ball and the

916.32 --> 921.019
man

917.1 --> 921.019
that's Wheeling it but mostly the ball

922.139 --> 926.339
no that's not entirely true it's mostly

924.0 --> 928.92
the people but effectively like the ball

926.339 --> 930.899
is the main focal point

928.92 --> 934.019
so you're watching at a

930.899 --> 936.959
flying spinning often ball

934.019 --> 940.199
ever thought of that

936.959 --> 943.459
dude Matthew what the hell

940.199 --> 943.459
why are you bringing that up

955.68 --> 961.8599999999999
what what the hell are you talking about

958.44 --> 965.3000000000001

yeah stop that's right

1024.319 --> 1031.1789999999999
stop but first tell me what the [ __ ] are

1028.459 --> 1031.179
you talking about

1031.6 --> 1038.0
Chrome football is a symbol for entry

1034.76 --> 1041.319
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

1038.0 --> 1041.319

1041.66 --> 1047.1200000000001
junk attacks explain what the hell are

1045.079 --> 1049.52

1047.12 --> 1051.6789999999999
what the [ __ ] is this

1049.52 --> 1055.1
how did you come up with this did you

1051.679 --> 1058.6000000000001
watch some crazy ass paranoid conspiracy

1055.1 --> 1058.6
[ __ ] video or something

1058.7 --> 1063.559
where did you get this [ __ ] how how

1061.88 --> 1067.1000000000001
does it

1063.559 --> 1069.02
stop copying random [ __ ] from nutcases

1067.1 --> 1072.3999999999999
on the internet that are just

1069.02 --> 1076.52
discernably Nut Cases stop copying

1072.4 --> 1079.6000000000001
nonsense remarks from these people yeah

1076.52 --> 1079.6
don't do that

1088.16 --> 1095.24
and if it isn't then explain how

1093.2 --> 1099.14
you can't just say something like that

1095.24 --> 1102.5
and just not explain it

1099.14 --> 1105.38
I wouldn't dare to say something like

1102.5 --> 1108.86
that in any chat to anyone for any

1105.38 --> 1112.5200000000002
reason unless I could in detail make

1108.86 --> 1116.3799999999999
them understand why that's real

1112.52 --> 1116.3799999999999
I'm serious Jeff gashead

1117.679 --> 1122.299
you need to you need to spill the beans

1120.26 --> 1125.539
right here you need to lay it down you

1122.299 --> 1129.1399999999999
you set something pretty extreme

1125.539 --> 1131.539
and now you need to justify it

1129.14 --> 1133.4
did you just hear it off some random

1131.539 --> 1135.62
crazy video

1133.4 --> 1138.2
and you didn't think about like maybe I

1135.62 --> 1140.78
should just like not watch those and now

1138.2 --> 1143.539
you're blabbering it and on an ultimate

1140.78 --> 1146.539
autopilot or something or is it an

1143.539 --> 1151.179
actual concept that you dug into

1146.539 --> 1151.179
and well lay down the details then

1156.919 --> 1161.7800000000002
sorry to yeah raise my voice to you like

1160.039 --> 1164.74
this but

1161.78 --> 1164.74
come on man

1174.26 --> 1181.66
from a video from last year

1177.14 --> 1181.66
what video and what

1182.12 --> 1188.4799999999998
I still don't even understand what it is

1184.94 --> 1192.919
you're actually trying to communicate

1188.48 --> 1196.58
football symbolism adrenochrome what how

1192.919 --> 1198.0800000000002
how what are the the trigger points

1196.58 --> 1199.9399999999998
what's the connection what's the

1198.08 --> 1201.86
framework I have no idea what you're

1199.94 --> 1204.0800000000002
talking about

1201.86 --> 1209.1999999999998
this just seems like straight out

1204.08 --> 1209.1999999999998
slander to me at this point straight out

1214.159 --> 1216.7
foreign

1247.159 --> 1250.7600000000002
okay

1249.26 --> 1253.6589999999999
okay what the hell does that have to do

1250.76 --> 1253.6589999999999
with adrenochrome

1257.539 --> 1261.26
as far as I remember the adrenal gland

1259.82 --> 1263.72
is like

1261.26 --> 1266.0
right next to your kidneys

1263.72 --> 1269.14
that's not adrenochrome what the hell

1266.0 --> 1269.14
does that have to do with it

1278.299 --> 1284.6
wow

1280.659 --> 1288.0800000000002
looks like you dove into a mind twist

1284.6 --> 1290.4189999999999
video Jeff gashead

1288.08 --> 1292.22
I tried to delete that from your memory

1290.419 --> 1294.7990000000002
if I could because it sounds like

1292.22 --> 1298.039
absolute horse [ __ ]

1294.799 --> 1300.62
one of those brain Scramblers

1298.039 --> 1303.679
that just makes you completely go ape

1300.62 --> 1306.039
[ __ ] on things based on absolutely

1303.679 --> 1306.039
nothing

1322.88 --> 1330.5800000000002
if this is all you can provide for

1327.44 --> 1330.5800000000002
and reflection

1339.02 --> 1341.62
all right

1377.78 --> 1384.44
no Jeff gas I'm glad you agree but it's

1381.02 --> 1387.98
not silly it's disgusting

1384.44 --> 1390.02
yeah it's like oh oh look what you need

1387.98 --> 1393.02
to do with oh look oh look at this

1390.02 --> 1394.76
detail oh this is the torture procedure

1393.02 --> 1399.28
that they like to do with the little

1394.76 --> 1399.28
kids oh look at all man can you imagine

1399.86 --> 1404.7199999999998
[Music]

1401.24 --> 1406.059
why the [ __ ] would you watch something

1404.72 --> 1409.52
like that

1406.059 --> 1413.12
why why do you do that to yourself you

1409.52 --> 1416.799
should smack your face into a wall three

1413.12 --> 1420.1399999999999
times before you ever consider

1416.799 --> 1422.0
not instantly within a quarter of a

1420.14 --> 1424.96
second clicking such things away and

1422.0 --> 1429.5
deleting whatever lead you had to that

1424.96 --> 1432.2
forever immediately right

1429.5 --> 1433.94
why the [ __ ] would you watch such

1432.2 --> 1436.3600000000001
garbage

1433.94 --> 1436.3600000000001
ever

1436.64 --> 1443.48
there is no way ever you could ever

1440.6 --> 1446.0
confirm any of it ever

1443.48 --> 1449.539
that it even happens or it wasn't just

1446.0 --> 1452.299
made up some by some psychopath to mind

1449.539 --> 1454.4
twist people that can't handle that [ __ ]

1452.299 --> 1456.98
and they're certainly never gonna

1454.4 --> 1458.779
actually know whether it's true and that

1456.98 --> 1461.299
it even happens

1458.779 --> 1464.0
really there you're gonna go out and

1461.299 --> 1466.76
actually now then yeah

1464.0 --> 1468.98
approach actual Psychopaths to see if

1466.76 --> 1471.799
they actually do that or what a great

1468.98 --> 1474.98
idea that's such a good course in your

1471.799 --> 1476.6
life to go on a research for that man

1474.98 --> 1479.3600000000001
your life is definitely going to get

1476.6 --> 1483.76
better when you do that yeah

1479.36 --> 1483.76
it's a psychopath trap

1484.279 --> 1489.22
never watch any of that ever

1502.299 --> 1505.36
thank you

1510.2 --> 1519.14
name one single thing one thing

1515.539 --> 1521.0
that knowing supposedly knowing these

1519.14 --> 1522.7990000000002
things that you you are hopefully not

1521.0 --> 1524.179
gonna try to confirm whether it's even

1522.799 --> 1526.94
true or not

1524.179 --> 1528.6200000000001
tell me one thing ever that you can

1526.94 --> 1531.3200000000002
imagine

1528.62 --> 1535.82
that some kind of good could come out of

1531.32 --> 1538.52
knowing such things one thing ever in

1535.82 --> 1540.32
any imaginable circumstance tell me one

1538.52 --> 1543.26
thing

1540.32 --> 1546.1399999999999
that that would be good that can come

1543.26 --> 1548.299
out of knowing that ever under any

1546.14 --> 1552.88
circumstance

1548.299 --> 1552.8799999999999
nothing absolutely nothing

1555.2 --> 1558.259
[Music]

1575.179 --> 1579.5
good

1576.26 --> 1580.64
never watch it again and never mention

1579.5 --> 1583.82
it again

1580.64 --> 1586.72
don't ever think about it again just

1583.82 --> 1586.72
erase it

1592.34 --> 1596.059
and if all possible if you're willing to

1594.26 --> 1598.8799999999999
go there

1596.059 --> 1602.12
vent that position like I do

1598.88 --> 1605.779
get pissed off when people have the gall

1602.12 --> 1607.52
to bring up those [ __ ] mind twist

1605.779 --> 1611.24
traps

1607.52 --> 1612.86
put there by Psychopaths to make people

1611.24 --> 1617.02
deranged

1612.86 --> 1617.02
it's an offense it's a curse

1673.64 --> 1675.94
foreign

1693.38 --> 1696.88
whoa you've been drinking

1699.02 --> 1701.86
wow

1703.1 --> 1707.02
Saturday night partying eh

1736.059 --> 1740.72
right

1737.84 --> 1743.0
okay so yeah I'm gonna try to let that

1740.72 --> 1746.059
ruin my mood although it's already a bit

1743.0 --> 1748.94
too late for that reason

1746.059 --> 1751.58
because that was absolutely something I

1748.94 --> 1754.22
did not want to talk about pretty much

1751.58 --> 1756.9189999999999
like the exact opposite of everything

1754.22 --> 1759.46
that I wanted to talk about was that

1756.919 --> 1759.46
thanks

1760.46 --> 1765.94
for a second I actually considered just

1762.559 --> 1765.94
Banning you did you know that

1768.14 --> 1774.44
but I knew it was just a mistake a

1771.62 --> 1776.9799999999998
really stupid mistake but

1774.44 --> 1776.98
whatever

1781.84 --> 1787.52
I mean what the [ __ ] man

1784.94 --> 1790.039
is that what you would do like oh oh

1787.52 --> 1792.74
there's Sunday church service it's

1790.039 --> 1796.1589999999999
Easter let's come together hey did you

1792.74 --> 1799.7
know football is a symbol for adrenicron

1796.159 --> 1802.7600000000002
which the elite extract from torture

1799.7 --> 1805.82
children like what the [ __ ] man you

1802.76 --> 1808.8799999999999
bring that up during Easter what the

1805.82 --> 1813.46
hell is wrong with you seriously

1808.88 --> 1813.46
sorry I'm not letting it go oh

1817.1 --> 1819.76
God

1822.5 --> 1827.12
I'm not gonna hold a grudge over this

1824.36 --> 1829.36
Jeff's but I am absolutely baffled about

1827.12 --> 1829.36
it

1846.14 --> 1849.1000000000001
huh

1855.14 --> 1859.3990000000001
let's talk Easter

1857.72 --> 1862.659
what do you mean

1859.399 --> 1862.6589999999999
George Sanford

1885.019 --> 1888.019
foreign

1900.76 --> 1906.82
anyway

1902.539 --> 1906.82
yeah yesterday's show was great

1907.82 --> 1913.519
besides the freaking

1910.159 --> 1918.3200000000002
sick bastard getting in there and

1913.519 --> 1920.179
making me say certain harsh things

1918.32 --> 1922.1589999999999
but yeah the whole fabric of the

1920.179 --> 1925.3400000000001
consciousness

1922.159 --> 1929.7990000000002
like that it's really

1925.34 --> 1929.799
yeah this is my new Turf basically

1929.899 --> 1934.34
this is my new thing

1931.7 --> 1938.24
it is a thing like this is not just oh

1934.34 --> 1939.6789999999999
Arwin says something very complex and oh

1938.24 --> 1942.919
it's so

1939.679 --> 1946.3400000000001
oh insightful but yet mysterious no no

1942.919 --> 1949.76
this is actually something real

1946.34 --> 1953.0
it's like an an entire framework

1949.76 --> 1955.899
situation for the the pattern of the

1953.0 --> 1955.899
Consciousness itself

1956.12 --> 1961.6999999999998
and yeah I also I think I got onto 24 7

1959.659 --> 1965.38
Discord a bit

1961.7 --> 1965.38
again talking about it

1966.919 --> 1972.0800000000002
so yeah as I have in the past started

1970.1 --> 1974.12
like the sun is holographic it's

1972.08 --> 1976.22
non-local apparition

1974.12 --> 1978.32
blah blah blah

1976.22 --> 1981.2
this is something that's going to be

1978.32 --> 1984.08
part of my new repertoire

1981.2 --> 1985.7
of conceptions and this one is very this

1984.08 --> 1989.799
is basically a thing in the spirit

1985.7 --> 1989.799
mechanics this is the thing now

1990.799 --> 1993.279
right

1993.799 --> 2001.9189999999999
fabric of the Consciousness is comprised

1997.279 --> 2001.919
of reflections of the material Realm

2003.159 --> 2008.8600000000001
I couldn't put the comprised of part in

2006.519 --> 2010.659
in the text from yesterday's show

2008.86 --> 2012.6399999999999
because then would be over 100

2010.659 --> 2016.38
characters

2012.64 --> 2016.38
but that is what it's supposed to say

2017.019 --> 2021.539
and I'm really thinking about it a lot

2019.059 --> 2024.1589999999999
now and it's pretty miraculous because

2021.539 --> 2027.1589999999999
this is not just a general oversight

2024.159 --> 2029.5
like this is like me completely back

2027.159 --> 2031.419
engineering everything I've ever

2029.5 --> 2033.46
experienced

2031.419 --> 2035.8600000000001
ever

2033.46 --> 2037.779
I'm literally digging like through

2035.86 --> 2041.4399999999998
everything including my Dark World

2037.779 --> 2044.94
Visions because those two and already

2041.44 --> 2047.019
drew that conclusion much earlier

2044.94 --> 2048.52
Reflections from the physical world

2047.019 --> 2050.32
right

2048.52 --> 2052.359
that's why I said like oh this is like a

2050.32 --> 2055.96
Holodeck experience and it just things

2052.359 --> 2057.879
from The Real World are shown to me and

2055.96 --> 2061.079
like I even get to experience other

2057.879 --> 2061.0789999999997
people's experiences

2061.119 --> 2064.839
seemingly

2062.98 --> 2068.46
right but it might have been like

2064.839 --> 2070.419
artificial like they can manipulate

2068.46 --> 2072.52
experiences

2070.419 --> 2074.919
like there would be a video of it in a

2072.52 --> 2076.839
cartoon then I get to experience it from

2074.919 --> 2079.839
a first person perspective of a

2076.839 --> 2083.379
character but with real life people

2079.839 --> 2085.72
which makes absolutely no sense

2083.379 --> 2088.54
like

2085.72 --> 2091.839
well yeah it makes no sense

2088.54 --> 2094.24
like it's not just a recorded image

2091.839 --> 2096.7
something is done inside of the brain

2094.24 --> 2099.64
with the imagery

2096.7 --> 2101.68
apparently and then my experience

2099.64 --> 2103.9
basically pointed at what could be

2101.68 --> 2106.24
creatively done with the data that we

2103.9 --> 2108.64
receive

2106.24 --> 2111.18
and that gave the Dark World Holodeck

2108.64 --> 2111.18
experience

2111.88 --> 2117.6400000000003
but with guidance like there are things

2114.82 --> 2120.46
there there are

2117.64 --> 2123.0989999999997
entities outside of the material realm

2120.46 --> 2125.92
then the spirit Realm

2123.099 --> 2129.94
and whether they are part of you

2125.92 --> 2132.88
or like we're all we might all simply be

2129.94 --> 2136.06
like cells in a singular body in a way

2132.88 --> 2139.26
with our spirits

2136.06 --> 2139.2599999999998
I'm not even joking

2140.5 --> 2146.26
right here we are separated

2143.38 --> 2150.339
but on a spiritual level we might

2146.26 --> 2154.079
actually be more closely comparable to

2150.339 --> 2154.0789999999997
cells in a singular body

2154.18 --> 2159.52
that are like right next to one or like

2156.52 --> 2162.04
we are part of an organism really and on

2159.52 --> 2164.68
the spiritual level we do know that and

2162.04 --> 2166.06
we function like that spiritually that's

2164.68 --> 2169.4199999999996
the weird part

2166.06 --> 2172.119
right another

2169.42 --> 2174.579
gory is inside literally just rolled out

2172.119 --> 2176.02
of my head

2174.579 --> 2178.0
but yeah

2176.02 --> 2180.64
it's also thanks to just the

2178.0 --> 2183.28
understanding now of metaphors

2180.64 --> 2185.98
why do metaphors work

2183.28 --> 2188.6800000000003
it's because of the very nature of the

2185.98 --> 2190.42
fabric of our spirits

2188.68 --> 2191.98
all of it

2190.42 --> 2195.2200000000003
I mean

2191.98 --> 2197.5
if animals could understand some form of

2195.22 --> 2200.14
language then I'm pretty damn sure that

2197.5 --> 2202.8
they use metaphors too

2200.14 --> 2206.02
because metaphor is

2202.8 --> 2208.599
derived from the mechanics of our basic

2206.02 --> 2211.42
experiences like the experience that

2208.599 --> 2215.56
when very little kids are just still

2211.42 --> 2219.42
like to try to move around and learn how

2215.56 --> 2222.16
to crawl and walk and like do stuff with

2219.42 --> 2223.359
objects and really try to see what is

2222.16 --> 2226.54
this right

2223.359 --> 2228.04
it's basically from that stage in a way

2226.54 --> 2230.92
I think

2228.04 --> 2233.859
where just this Universal understanding

2230.92 --> 2235.48
of metaphors why that works with

2233.859 --> 2238.2
everybody

2235.48 --> 2241.92
you can even use it to to bridge

2238.2 --> 2241.9199999999996
language barriers

2258.52 --> 2262.66
yeah it's actually seeing Justice in

2260.68 --> 2265.4199999999996
front but oh Matthew is that what you

2262.66 --> 2269.2599999999998
want to do right is that the moment

2265.42 --> 2272.26
when we're going to remember Christ's

2269.26 --> 2275.1400000000003
rising from the dead it's like oh oh

2272.26 --> 2277.0
there's Injustice okay well we're

2275.14 --> 2277.839
celebrating Christ returning from the

2277.0 --> 2280.9
dead

2277.839 --> 2283.24
let's go to war right now let's do

2280.9 --> 2286.6800000000003
something about it immediately literally

2283.24 --> 2286.68
get out your weapons

2286.8 --> 2293.5600000000004
arrange Vehicles go to a location and

2290.38 --> 2295.42
start start War like oh really is that

2293.56 --> 2296.92
what you're gonna do then is so is that

2295.42 --> 2298.78
the good reason to bring it up because

2296.92 --> 2301.119
we're immediately going to do something

2298.78 --> 2304.5400000000004
about that right now is that the time

2301.119 --> 2308.5
for it no no it's never the time for

2304.54 --> 2310.96
that it's only disruptive

2308.5 --> 2313.3
like nobody's ever going to bring up

2310.96 --> 2318.82
something like that during a ritual

2313.3 --> 2318.82
times and then actually accomplish

2319.5 --> 2325.18
the potential reason why you would bring

2322.24 --> 2326.7999999999997
it up because it is massive Injustice

2325.18 --> 2330.46
and something needs to be done right now

2326.8 --> 2332.8
yeah well guess what it isn't

2330.46 --> 2334.839
and you don't even know how much of it

2332.8 --> 2338.04
is actually real

2334.839 --> 2338.04
you don't know

2351.94 --> 2356.56
can you imagine

2353.859 --> 2358.5989999999997
I'm sorry and

2356.56 --> 2360.7
do you have gas at please

2358.599 --> 2363.88
at this point it's no longer really

2360.7 --> 2365.3199999999997
about what you did okay I forgive you I

2363.88 --> 2367.78
mean it I forgive you

2365.32 --> 2369.6400000000003
you already said you're sorry you proved

2367.78 --> 2370.8390000000004
that it you kind of slept It Out by

2369.64 --> 2373.18
accident

2370.839 --> 2375.22
this is just you're probably not the

2373.18 --> 2377.0789999999997
only one you see that does that

2375.22 --> 2379.48
I've seen it happen before just great

2377.079 --> 2381.2200000000003
people like oh did you read about this

2379.48 --> 2383.38
and I was like dude what the hell have

2381.22 --> 2386.2
you been looking at

2383.38 --> 2388.359
don't do that what are you gonna do with

2386.2 --> 2391.24
that it's just gonna haunt you that's

2388.359 --> 2393.2799999999997
all it's just going to haunt you you're

2391.24 --> 2395.0789999999997
not gonna even be able to test whether

2393.28 --> 2397.2400000000002
it's real or not

2395.079 --> 2400.32
why the hell would you subject yourself

2397.24 --> 2400.3199999999997
to something like that

2401.26 --> 2405.4
right

2402.82 --> 2407.2000000000003
so this is that I'm going on and on

2405.4 --> 2408.579
about it's not about because I want to

2407.2 --> 2411.64
just

2408.579 --> 2415.5
punish you Jeff right don't take it

2411.64 --> 2415.5
personal it's Universal

2415.54 --> 2420.7
but can you imagine that

2418.119 --> 2423.4
Christ just got

2420.7 --> 2425.6189999999997
like the tomb open Christ is not there

2423.4 --> 2428.8
and then he appears he comes walking up

2425.619 --> 2430.7200000000003
and everybody's like oh my god he has

2428.8 --> 2433.3
returned it's a miracle

2430.72 --> 2436.7799999999997
and like crying and one of the guys

2433.3 --> 2439.42
could have Jesus did you know

2436.78 --> 2441.4
that in the future they're going to

2439.42 --> 2443.7400000000002
literally torture children and then

2441.4 --> 2445.9
drink their adrenalized blood and have

2443.74 --> 2448.72
all these hallucinations and [ __ ] like

2445.9 --> 2451.3
and Jesus would freaking smack that

2448.72 --> 2453.8799999999997
person in the face

2451.3 --> 2455.8
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you get the

2453.88 --> 2460.599
[ __ ] out of here

2455.8 --> 2462.6400000000003
I just returned from the dead you freak

2460.599 --> 2465.76
right

2462.64 --> 2469.02
so don't take it personal Geographic

2465.76 --> 2469.0200000000004
there's a bit of a joke

2469.599 --> 2472.92
I'm I'm okay now

2481.72 --> 2487.0789999999997
I mean everybody know Jeff is a pretty

2484.48 --> 2487.079
awesome guy

2488.02 --> 2492.88
but I guess he gets a bit carried away

2489.819 --> 2494.38
sometimes but yeah most of us do at

2492.88 --> 2498.839
times

2494.38 --> 2498.839
all right myself more than most

2502.839 --> 2507.7
all right good to hear Jeff

2505.54 --> 2509.619
I hope you're doing okay

2507.7 --> 2513.1189999999997
just try to get that [ __ ] out of your

2509.619 --> 2513.119
mind man it's for the best

2524.98 --> 2527.94
what the hell

2530.8 --> 2533.46
did

2541.18 --> 2547.8999999999996
I don't want to know what that even is

2545.26 --> 2550.1800000000003
Terry 306 why the hell would you bring

2547.9 --> 2551.5
that up

2550.18 --> 2554.14

2551.5 --> 2557.16
is that some kind of animal torture dude

2554.14 --> 2557.16

2566.38 --> 2572.819
I don't want that kind of suggestions in

2568.9 --> 2572.819

2584.94 --> 2590.819
Godzilla YouTube delete that

2594.099 --> 2597.839
what the hell is wrong with you guys

2598.1 --> 2601.219
[Music]

2607.18 --> 2610.18
foreign

2615.88 --> 2619.42
yeah

2617.22 --> 2620.7999999999997
anti-flat earthers are complete dick

2619.42 --> 2622.119
weeds

2620.8 --> 2623.38
and they don't know what the hell

2622.119 --> 2625.9
they're doing

2623.38 --> 2627.359
but I don't see them like

2625.9 --> 2629.8
they're not

2627.359 --> 2631.96
sadistic they're not like gonna torture

2629.8 --> 2636.2200000000003
creatures or anything that that's just

2631.96 --> 2639.04
way over the top like no they don't

2636.22 --> 2642.3999999999996
I mean some of these freaky trolls might

2639.04 --> 2645.2799999999997
have such sick habits right

2642.4 --> 2647.319
but not the anti-flat earthers

2645.28 --> 2650.079
now they're much more in a [ __ ] position

2647.319 --> 2653.5
they like to trigger people and then

2650.079 --> 2655.42
make them go off on them right they

2653.5 --> 2656.98
don't mind being punished

2655.42 --> 2658.78
so they're not say that they're much

2656.98 --> 2661.66
more like

2658.78 --> 2664.5400000000004
masochists

2661.66 --> 2667.5
you have to be in order to keep going as

2664.54 --> 2667.5
an anti-flat earther

2672.76 --> 2677.38
are the trolls

2675.7 --> 2679.06
right

2677.38 --> 2684.2200000000003
yeah just don't

2679.06 --> 2686.2
don't actually describe it thanks right

2684.22 --> 2688.359
I mean if you just would have said like

2686.2 --> 2690.339
oh they tortured animals I'd be like

2688.359 --> 2692.98
that's already horrific enough okay you

2690.339 --> 2697.68
don't need to describe what type of

2692.98 --> 2697.68
action yeah just don't do that

2698.92 --> 2704.04
like

2700.96 --> 2704.04
it's unhealthy

2707.02 --> 2716.8
what the hell's in the air man

2709.65 --> 2716.8
[Music]

2724.54 --> 2730.66
I mean seriously isn't this the day that

2727.54 --> 2732.4
Christ basically just returned why is

2730.66 --> 2736.0
everybody

2732.4 --> 2738.52
this weird Darkness [ __ ]

2736.0 --> 2740.7
don't get it I don't feel like that at

2738.52 --> 2740.7
all

2744.339 --> 2746.94
hmm

2755.14 --> 2758.68
by the way you're not the only ones

2757.3 --> 2761.319
probably

2758.68 --> 2765.819
because I have more Associated memories

2761.319 --> 2772.02
in the past of people just getting oddly

2765.819 --> 2772.02
dark during Easter like on Easter

2774.04 --> 2781.56
and I never was like that I always it it

2778.3 --> 2781.5600000000004
doesn't happen to me

2783.099 --> 2785.6400000000003
it's weird

2788.14 --> 2792.52
full moon yeah there is a full moon

2790.3 --> 2796.0600000000004
that's right oh yesterday man yesterday

2792.52 --> 2799.68
night was pretty amazing

2796.06 --> 2799.68
hello by the way tominoid

2800.8 --> 2807.3390000000004
yeah yesterday clear skies

2804.339 --> 2810.64
Sun lasted very long and then in the

2807.339 --> 2812.74
night or even like before the sun went

2810.64 --> 2815.68
was completely gone

2812.74 --> 2818.3999999999996
the moon came up super bright started

2815.68 --> 2818.3999999999996
out kind of Orange

2819.76 --> 2825.76
but it was exhilarating like I had a

2822.64 --> 2827.6189999999997
really great night also watched

2825.76 --> 2830.079
funny movie

2827.619 --> 2833.2000000000003
it's been a long time since I watched

2830.079 --> 2837.2200000000003
that Spaceballs God

2833.2 --> 2840.46
it's goofy as [ __ ] but it's so detailed

2837.22 --> 2843.1189999999997
there's so much detail in that movie so

2840.46 --> 2846.94
many references some of them very

2843.119 --> 2850.6600000000003
contemporary like 80s others

2846.94 --> 2853.8
like oh man the mega maid scene

2850.66 --> 2856.839
sucking off the air it's just

2853.8 --> 2859.1800000000003
it's hysterical

2856.839 --> 2862.66
amazing

2859.18 --> 2865.0
and they just man it's such a quality

2862.66 --> 2868.96
movie anyways it's amazing Ludicrous

2865.0 --> 2870.96
Speed go yep

2868.96 --> 2870.96
yep

2872.44 --> 2877.98
oh what a great movie that was a true

2875.44 --> 2877.98
genius

2878.25 --> 2883.599
[Music]

2880.839 --> 2884.859
like they had so much fun making this

2883.599 --> 2887.579
thing

2884.859 --> 2887.5789999999997
and

2887.68 --> 2897.22
and it was just like it's not dark

2893.319 --> 2899.5
it's not that dark

2897.22 --> 2901.8999999999996
it's actually quite light-hearted in

2899.5 --> 2904.9
ways it's all like oh we're the baddies

2901.9 --> 2907.3
and then just making endless amounts of

2904.9 --> 2910.42
fun about that but even like how this

2907.3 --> 2911.98
Spaceball Empire works it's kind of

2910.42 --> 2913.48
fascinating

2911.98 --> 2916.599
like they're

2913.48 --> 2919.8
you know what they reminded me of

2916.599 --> 2919.8
the Spaceballs

2919.839 --> 2926.52
the freaking Empire right now this that

2923.02 --> 2926.52
was President Biden

2928.78 --> 2934.059
well not as bad as President Biden but

2931.9 --> 2937.2400000000002
it was basically him before he went

2934.059 --> 2938.8590000000004
demented or something it's just

2937.24 --> 2940.2999999999997
and just

2938.859 --> 2943.0
yeah

2940.3 --> 2947.28
like that's the new world order it's the

2943.0 --> 2947.28
Spaceballs complete retards

2947.5 --> 2951.52
and they got all the technology but they

2949.72 --> 2954.54
don't have leadership they don't have

2951.52 --> 2956.079
Focus it's just complete

2954.54 --> 2958.96
disarray

2956.079 --> 2960.96
in many ways but they have technology

2958.96 --> 2963.819
somehow

2960.96 --> 2966.3
Aaron account

2963.819 --> 2966.3
right

2968.2 --> 2972.8799999999997
anyway that was great

2970.3 --> 2975.7000000000003
also watch another series which opened

2972.88 --> 2978.78
up a whole can of surreal to me because

2975.7 --> 2978.7799999999997
I recognized it

2981.04 --> 2985.72
it's a Netflix series

2983.859 --> 2987.7599999999998
didn't watch Spaceballs on Netflix had

2985.72 --> 2990.5989999999997
to download that

2987.76 --> 2990.599
uh

2990.88 --> 2994.559
it's called the husband

2995.92 --> 3000.54
like a

2997.3 --> 3002.6400000000003
so yeah it's a

3000.54 --> 3004.319
kind of an anime but it's more like an

3002.64 --> 3007.16
animated

3004.319 --> 3007.16
uh

3008.819 --> 3014.16
an animated manga it's more like

3011.28 --> 3016.7400000000002
literally a comic book

3014.16 --> 3020.46
that has movement in it because there's

3016.74 --> 3025.64
no real fluid animated things in there

3020.46 --> 3025.64
but it's a it's crazy and over the top

3026.04 --> 3030.72
and

3027.42 --> 3033.3
quite astounding in ways it's like

3030.72 --> 3035.8799999999997
the guy that's the main character is

3033.3 --> 3037.2200000000003
literally completely bonkers

3035.88 --> 3040.02
like some

3037.22 --> 3043.6189999999997
ex-jakuza demonically possessed person

3040.02 --> 3044.9
kind of that's just trying to be a super

3043.619 --> 3047.52
neurotic

3044.9 --> 3051.2400000000002
extremely dedicated

3047.52 --> 3055.619
like a housewife but a man

3051.24 --> 3057.7799999999997
that to me is kind of hysterical because

3055.619 --> 3058.619
by the way that's kind of what I was

3057.78 --> 3062.579
like

3058.619 --> 3066.119
but not as insane as this guy

3062.579 --> 3068.7000000000003
and also it it reminds me because I

3066.119 --> 3072.48
think it's based on an actual manga

3068.7 --> 3074.64
series that I knew somebody in my past

3072.48 --> 3077.4
that actually watched that and then they

3074.64 --> 3080.7599999999998
showed it to me and I was just like

3077.4 --> 3082.98
this is creepy

3080.76 --> 3085.38
didn't know how to read it it was

3082.98 --> 3087.119
actually in Japanese and she was reading

3085.38 --> 3089.4
that

3087.119 --> 3092.1600000000003
and I'm like oh this I don't like the

3089.4 --> 3094.579
this is psycho but I didn't understand

3092.16 --> 3098.339
that it was all a joke I just couldn't

3094.579 --> 3102.6800000000003
grasp it but in this series it's in

3098.339 --> 3102.68
English or English subtitles

3102.839 --> 3108.54
and now I really get the joke so it's

3105.119 --> 3110.76
like almost like a 20-year delayed

3108.54 --> 3114.9
joke that I'm finally getting about

3110.76 --> 3116.579
something it's quite trippy

3114.9 --> 3118.559
anyway

3116.579 --> 3119.88
that's another thing that I was watching

3118.559 --> 3123.079
yesterday

3119.88 --> 3123.079
and the husband

3128.7 --> 3133.64
it might not be for you but I thought it

3131.099 --> 3133.6400000000003
was hilarious

3134.4 --> 3141.38
like I mean not as cool and

3137.76 --> 3141.38
fascinating as like

3144.619 --> 3148.92
turmer romanee

3147.359 --> 3151.2599999999998
no way

3148.92 --> 3154.02
because that is like really I love that

3151.26 --> 3157.6800000000003
series it's awesome

3154.02 --> 3160.579
but yeah this is kind of funny

3157.68 --> 3160.5789999999997
watching that

3166.14 --> 3171.2599999999998
else I've been watching things on

3168.359 --> 3171.2599999999998
YouTube I think

3177.96 --> 3183.2
yeah more Clips concerning mctoon

3183.72 --> 3189.0
who had yeah this amazing moment where

3186.78 --> 3191.0400000000004
he basically by accident starts

3189.0 --> 3192.92
explaining like oh this is how it would

3191.04 --> 3195.24
work on a flat plane and

3192.92 --> 3197.04
realizing like he couldn't actually

3195.24 --> 3199.2599999999998
point at any mistake because they were

3197.04 --> 3201.72
there he would there wasn't any

3199.26 --> 3203.46
so then he accidentally clicked on a

3201.72 --> 3205.8799999999997
video and then forgot what he was

3203.46 --> 3205.88
talking about

3207.599 --> 3212.6400000000003
hysterical

3210.3 --> 3215.3590000000004
like that that genuinely made me laugh

3212.64 --> 3215.359
several times

3218.46 --> 3224.0
oh yeah I watched something on Paul

3220.619 --> 3224.0
cooked I don't know if you know them

3224.16 --> 3230.04
was exploring some star Fort that was

3226.74 --> 3232.02
actually like mud bar buried partially

3230.04 --> 3235.2799999999997
really weird

3232.02 --> 3235.28
interesting video

3237.54 --> 3243.119
if you want to look at some bizarre Rune

3240.66 --> 3246.5
explorations

3243.119 --> 3246.5
I'll link you up with that

3246.96 --> 3250.4
okay I hadn't seen this before

3253.5 --> 3257.3
what's going on with my chat

3276.96 --> 3281.28
Man On The Edge for me Easter always

3279.059 --> 3282.9
meant eating too much chocolate yeah

3281.28 --> 3286.28
yeah

3282.9 --> 3286.28
I sure remember that

3288.72 --> 3292.5789999999997
yeah I don't eat chocolate anymore

3296.28 --> 3301.1600000000003
though I've ate a lot of chocolate in my

3299.04 --> 3301.16
life

3321.599 --> 3325.46
okay where did everybody go

3344.76 --> 3349.1400000000003
ah

3346.2 --> 3351.06
good to see you

3349.14 --> 3354.199
right

3351.06 --> 3354.199
[Music]

3366.119 --> 3368.54
right right

3375.78 --> 3380.5400000000004
right so what were you all up to

3381.599 --> 3384.319
yesterday

3385.98 --> 3391.859
anything I missed out on

3389.46 --> 3395.96
some anti-flatter did something nutty

3391.859 --> 3395.96
again or nothing remarkable

3420.24 --> 3422.7799999999997
all right

3441.78 --> 3446.48
still here watching oh okay yeah

3450.119 --> 3454.6800000000003
right I'm not telling you to like watch

3452.4 --> 3456.96
that video now it's a

3454.68 --> 3460.68
it's just kind of a tunnel exploration

3456.96 --> 3463.799
video with commentary

3460.68 --> 3467.22
but yeah it is

3463.799 --> 3469.14
like not a super short video

3467.22 --> 3471.1189999999997
so don't go watch it right now it's just

3469.14 --> 3472.319
something that I watched yesterday and I

3471.119 --> 3477.299
thought

3472.319 --> 3480.299
that like you guys might appreciate that

3477.299 --> 3482.4
it is the exploration of a star Fort but

3480.299 --> 3484.2
yeah it's not like the first time it's

3482.4 --> 3487.38
opened or anything and there's like even

3484.2 --> 3489.7799999999997
gravity and all that crap in there

3487.38 --> 3492.619
but it is really interesting the way

3489.78 --> 3492.619
it's just built

3493.2 --> 3495.68
right

3508.14 --> 3510.68
hmm

3531.96 --> 3536.819
freaking hate Jose

3534.0 --> 3539.42
all right well I don't hate him it's

3536.819 --> 3539.42
just that

3540.119 --> 3544.38
just don't trust him

3542.28 --> 3545.88
and you'll be all right like he won't

3544.38 --> 3548.4
even like

3545.88 --> 3550.6800000000003
disturb you or anything if you're gonna

3548.4 --> 3551.64
like try to hold him to task on

3550.68 --> 3553.98
something

3551.64 --> 3557.42
yeah then he's gonna just become like an

3553.98 --> 3557.42
anti-flatter all of a sudden

3557.46 --> 3562.38
so I'm like no no no I'm not going to

3560.04 --> 3564.9
take your ball away from you Jose

3562.38 --> 3567.0
now it's your ball and you're gonna keep

3564.9 --> 3570.7200000000003
it and yeah you're the one that's going

3567.0 --> 3573.9
to have to keep it yeah I I'm not gonna

3570.72 --> 3576.5989999999997
my hands are off

3573.9 --> 3579.02
deal with it yourself it's your freaking

3576.599 --> 3579.02
belief

3589.68 --> 3592.3999999999996
hmm

3611.339 --> 3616.799
right yeah and Jose has been like pretty

3614.46 --> 3619.14
partial to me

3616.799 --> 3620.16
but it is I guess because I just get him

3619.14 --> 3622.799
now

3620.16 --> 3627.1189999999997
I used to be like really pissed off when

3622.799 --> 3629.64
he basically he betrayed Flat Earth

3627.119 --> 3631.2000000000003
because I had like pretty high hopes for

3629.64 --> 3633.1189999999997
that guy I thought like this guy is

3631.2 --> 3635.339
talented

3633.119 --> 3637.44
because he kind of was in a way like he

3635.339 --> 3640.0789999999997
was away with words and then like he

3637.44 --> 3643.14
seemed to just get it

3640.079 --> 3646.98
and I had like this is awesome

3643.14 --> 3650.04
this could be our guy their next guy and

3646.98 --> 3653.94
then yeah we'd suddenly turn against it

3650.04 --> 3656.64
and start to become trollish and [ __ ]

3653.94 --> 3658.68
and that was like it hurt me personally

3656.64 --> 3661.5
like a betrayal

3658.68 --> 3664.2
but now that's like some time ago he

3661.5 --> 3666.18
hasn't really tried to get under my skin

3664.2 --> 3669.859
or under even

3666.18 --> 3669.859
anybody else's skin too much

3672.119 --> 3676.6800000000003
like on the flatter side

3674.04 --> 3679.5589999999997
so I just like nah

3676.68 --> 3681.1189999999997
I don't mind I even every now and then

3679.559 --> 3685.1600000000003
go over to him just to see what he's

3681.119 --> 3685.1600000000003
doing it's not that bad

3685.92 --> 3691.2000000000003
yeah ranty is much worse I I can't stand

3689.579 --> 3693.299
Randy

3691.2 --> 3695.3999999999996
I'm not going to watch that because

3693.299 --> 3696.72
every time I turn it on it's just like

3695.4 --> 3699.5
Ugh

3696.72 --> 3699.5
terrible

3752.4 --> 3756.2000000000003
okay

3753.539 --> 3756.2000000000003
right

3756.9 --> 3761.539
let's get some tea

3758.88 --> 3761.539
cheers

3766.81 --> 3769.909
[Music]

3777.0 --> 3781.26
imagine knowing the truth and then lying

3779.339 --> 3783.42
about it

3781.26 --> 3784.6800000000003
well it depends on why you're lying

3783.42 --> 3787.4
about it right

3784.68 --> 3789.1189999999997
if you knew something you figured it out

3787.4 --> 3791.76
and then

3789.119 --> 3793.98
realized that if you shared it it would

3791.76 --> 3797.039
literally make people go insane

3793.98 --> 3798.78
immediately like not so I'm not talking

3797.039 --> 3800.6400000000003
about a real life example here

3798.78 --> 3803.039
metaphorically

3800.64 --> 3805.5589999999997
like conceptually

3803.039 --> 3808.26
what-if situation you learn something

3805.559 --> 3810.119
you can handle it but if you knew that

3808.26 --> 3812.6400000000003
you would spread it people would

3810.119 --> 3814.859
immediately go insane like it would be

3812.64 --> 3816.66
very bad for them to know it they

3814.859 --> 3819.44
wouldn't be able to do anything build

3816.66 --> 3819.44
anything with it

3820.02 --> 3824.64
yeah then not

3822.299 --> 3827.339
sharing it

3824.64 --> 3831.5
is absolutely the best solution

3827.339 --> 3831.5
maybe even forget about it

3833.22 --> 3838.2
so

3834.539 --> 3840.539
but if he like already admittedly has

3838.2 --> 3843.48
done it for money

3840.539 --> 3845.88
then basically not sharing information

3843.48 --> 3848.599
because of money that's really

3845.88 --> 3848.599
disgusting

3849.839 --> 3855.599
like unless you could like make a quick

3852.24 --> 3859.4399999999996
profit out of it perhaps and then

3855.599 --> 3863.4
afterward just get real again

3859.44 --> 3866.46
but to literally get just because you

3863.4 --> 3868.619
could get extra payout you keep holding

3866.46 --> 3870.9
withholding information

3868.619 --> 3873.299
that's a pretty [ __ ] up way to go

3870.9 --> 3875.52
about for yourself

3873.299 --> 3877.38
is that really worth it I mean if you

3875.52 --> 3879.359
just hold your tongue for a moment to

3877.38 --> 3881.4
get a big profit in the go right and

3879.359 --> 3883.5
then afterwards you can just speak up

3881.4 --> 3886.26
again I mean

3883.5 --> 3887.94
might not be the most moral thing out

3886.26 --> 3889.559
there but yeah then who you know

3887.94 --> 3891.059
business

3889.559 --> 3895.079
I get it

3891.059 --> 3897.299
but to continually do something and then

3895.079 --> 3900.0
never be able to speak the truth like

3897.299 --> 3901.74
why the hell would anybody sign up for

3900.0 --> 3905.78
that

3901.74 --> 3905.7799999999997
I can't even imagine that

3906.9 --> 3910.28
lying is always wrong

3912.48 --> 3916.5
well

3913.559 --> 3919.2000000000003
by the mechanical definition yeah

3916.5 --> 3920.94
speaking non-truth

3919.2 --> 3924.0589999999997
indeed

3920.94 --> 3927.48
but yeah withholding information could

3924.059 --> 3933.02
also be considered lying

3927.48 --> 3933.02
but that's different right it's just

3936.46 --> 3939.55
[Music]

3951.42 --> 3956.94
what are you talking about Derek

3954.78 --> 3958.579
Stole My Money Oh you mean your tax

3956.94 --> 3962.42
money

3958.579 --> 3962.42
yeah no

3963.059 --> 3968.6600000000003
no he applied for the job

3965.94 --> 3968.66
that's all

3974.28 --> 3977.3990000000003
[Music]

3984.42 --> 3987.859
don't address him

3988.16 --> 3993.24
[Music]

3991.26 --> 3996.26
yeah I get it I

3993.24 --> 3996.2599999999998
don't want it

4096.859 --> 4099.859
foreign

4150.38 --> 4155.0
you know what

4151.94 --> 4157.759
I'm just gonna be silent for 20 minutes

4155.0 --> 4159.859
and see if anybody's gonna say anything

4157.759 --> 4163.94
in my chat ever

4159.859 --> 4167.299
if I just don't say anything right

4163.94 --> 4171.08
because like waiting three minutes on

4167.299 --> 4174.88
end before somebody says something again

4171.08 --> 4174.88
it's getting kind of annoying

4175.159 --> 4181.159
I mean my chat is like the slowest chat

4178.52 --> 4183.080000000001
I've ever come across on YouTube and I

4181.159 --> 4185.3589999999995
know you guys are there

4183.08 --> 4189.259
and you are smart

4185.359 --> 4192.259
and then you just don't say anything for

4189.259 --> 4194.48
several minutes on end like what the

4192.259 --> 4197.78
[ __ ] am I supposed to do then

4194.48 --> 4199.82
right I function literally on the

4197.78 --> 4202.82
interaction with the chat

4199.82 --> 4206.179
and you just don't say anything

4202.82 --> 4208.699
like have you ever seen Jim Bob's chat

4206.179 --> 4212.4800000000005
there's like literally a single year

4208.699 --> 4217.9
singular message popping up every two

4212.48 --> 4217.9
seconds every two seconds okay

4218.42 --> 4221.62
what's going on

4224.84 --> 4231.14
I mean I'm specifically a channel that

4228.5 --> 4233.3
interacts with my chat

4231.14 --> 4235.64
very directly it's not like I have a

4233.3 --> 4238.3
program and a chat on the side no I do

4235.64 --> 4238.3
it with my chat

4239.179 --> 4243.9800000000005
it doesn't work if you're just gonna not

4241.76 --> 4246.320000000001
do anything then

4243.98 --> 4248.599999999999
it's just gonna be me silent maybe you

4246.32 --> 4250.5199999999995
like that maybe you just like the idea

4248.6 --> 4254.320000000001
that it's just silent and it's okay

4250.52 --> 4254.320000000001
maybe that's fine I don't know

4256.94 --> 4263.0599999999995
but yeah

4259.52 --> 4265.820000000001
this keeps up I'll just test it out and

4263.06 --> 4268.280000000001
just like going to be silent for minutes

4265.82 --> 4271.46
and minutes and 10 minutes and 20

4268.28 --> 4275.62
minutes until somebody gets the idea to

4271.46 --> 4275.62
actually say something in my chat

4278.96 --> 4286.219
other than uh Audrina Crow football

4282.86 --> 4288.679
right because that's not the [ __ ] I want

4286.219 --> 4293.14
to talk about that's not inspiring

4288.679 --> 4293.14
it's not productive thinking

4299.42 --> 4304.1
still awake after sleepy

4301.46 --> 4307.78
okay

4304.1 --> 4307.780000000001
what time is it in India

4308.6 --> 4313.9400000000005
is it like six o'clock

4311.84 --> 4317.679
in the evening or something

4313.94 --> 4317.678999999999
no idea what time it is there

4322.92 --> 4329.38
[Music]

4324.44 --> 4329.379999999999
you were at the door okay PJ seen it

4334.82 --> 4339.38
and don't address people that I

4337.4 --> 4342.08
immediately delete just don't talk about

4339.38 --> 4345.28
them don't mention their names they

4342.08 --> 4345.28
don't exist you see

4350.54 --> 4352.719
foreign

4375.159 --> 4382.159
you realize I'm going to do it again

4379.219 --> 4385.04
I will be silent for 20 minutes straight

4382.159 --> 4387.28
if there's not stuff happening in my

4385.04 --> 4387.28
chat

4393.49 --> 4396.5599999999995
[Music]

4397.28 --> 4399.88
hmm

4405.08 --> 4409.46
all right preparing for Easter lunch

4407.36 --> 4413.38
okay that's reasonable Matthew Hall

4409.46 --> 4413.38
that's absolutely reasonable

4421.94 --> 4426.62
should learn more about gravity not

4423.98 --> 4429.82
being as we told

4426.62 --> 4429.82
As Told to us

4431.3 --> 4435.159000000001
and how to explain it to others

4437.96 --> 4441.5
well

4439.699 --> 4444.44
it's always going to be kind of

4441.5 --> 4448.52
difficult to explain exactly why what

4444.44 --> 4450.62
people think gravity is actually is not

4448.52 --> 4451.9400000000005
it's always going to come down to like

4450.62 --> 4454.159
yeah

4451.94 --> 4458.419999999999
I know that's what you get taught in

4454.159 --> 4462.199
school apple fall onto Newton's head

4458.42 --> 4464.9
and that there is like this Force

4462.199 --> 4467.239
that pulls or

4464.9 --> 4469.58
you know it has to be pull pull at the

4467.239 --> 4472.099999999999
distance right

4469.58 --> 4474.38
but yeah not everybody apparently in

4472.1 --> 4477.1990000000005
schools get informed at the end of the

4474.38 --> 4480.28
trip like yeah it's actually just an old

4477.199 --> 4480.28
model it's not real

4481.1 --> 4486.56
there's something else called Einstein

4483.38 --> 4488.6
gravity and usually at that age you

4486.56 --> 4490.76
don't get to be told exactly what it is

4488.6 --> 4493.780000000001
because it's like that's this Advanced

4490.76 --> 4493.780000000001
University stuff

4494.3 --> 4498.08
and then people don't really learn about

4496.219 --> 4500.12
that

4498.08 --> 4502.64
right so then

4500.12 --> 4504.5599999999995
just kind of forget about it hold on to

4502.64 --> 4507.320000000001
like oh what they learned in school the

4504.56 --> 4510.5
basic gravity concept but

4507.32 --> 4513.0199999999995
that's never even within their lifetime

4510.5 --> 4515.0
it's never been accepted as actually

4513.02 --> 4518.0
real you see

4515.0 --> 4521.78
it's only because of just

4518.0 --> 4523.82
the folklore that comes out of teaching

4521.78 --> 4525.8
it in schools that makes people believe

4523.82 --> 4527.719
that's real

4525.8 --> 4531.5
even though while they're being taught

4527.719 --> 4533.719
it it's already often admitted not to be

4531.5 --> 4535.82
real

4533.719 --> 4538.76
so it just becomes like this folklore

4535.82 --> 4540.5
myth the gravity how that works the

4538.76 --> 4543.56
mechanisms and then people just think

4540.5 --> 4545.9
that that's the real thing

4543.56 --> 4549.1990000000005
if you can explain in that

4545.9 --> 4551.599999999999
then you'll get a very far right but it

4549.199 --> 4553.82
will immediately reveal a huge problem

4551.6 --> 4555.679
if you do that because where's the

4553.82 --> 4557.9
problem the problem is is that schools

4555.679 --> 4562.52
are literally teaching something

4557.9 --> 4564.98
that they know isn't real

4562.52 --> 4568.34
and that's problem that's a problem

4564.98 --> 4572.12
right people when you face make them

4568.34 --> 4574.82
face that they will feel a problem

4572.12 --> 4577.4
a big problem like there's a systemic

4574.82 --> 4579.5
error in the education system that will

4577.4 --> 4581.659
not come out

4579.5 --> 4583.1
why won't it come out and then they'll

4581.659 --> 4584.599999999999
get a headache because they'll realize

4583.1 --> 4587.120000000001
like all these people that are like

4584.6 --> 4589.219
fanatically protecting it

4587.12 --> 4591.5599999999995
and it doesn't make sense

4589.219 --> 4593.42
and they don't want to get involved

4591.56 --> 4594.9800000000005
and then they'll forget about it and

4593.42 --> 4597.38
they'll just say oh I'll just believe a

4594.98 --> 4600.08
new tone and gravity and it's outdated

4597.38 --> 4602.719
that's what's gonna happen

4600.08 --> 4604.88
when Newton went full

4602.719 --> 4607.76
tart apple what

4604.88 --> 4610.28
no Newton did not go for [ __ ] nilton

4607.76 --> 4613.04
never claimed the hypothesis for his

4610.28 --> 4615.44
conception in the first instance

4613.04 --> 4617.06
there is an officially Written Letter

4615.44 --> 4619.96
that

4617.06 --> 4619.96
proves that

4620.54 --> 4625.4
where he with great Passion denounce the

4623.239 --> 4627.5199999999995
notion that it is a hypothesis a

4625.4 --> 4630.86
scientific hypothesis

4627.52 --> 4633.34
so it never really was real in the first

4630.86 --> 4633.339999999999
place

4639.92 --> 4643.179
okay turret

4646.34 --> 4651.5
right but Newtonian mechanics are just

4649.28 --> 4654.98
conceptual mechanics

4651.5 --> 4658.159
what Newton did was display that he was

4654.98 --> 4660.86
really good in mechanical thinking into

4658.159 --> 4663.5599999999995
deriving patterns

4660.86 --> 4665.42
and then formulating them in systems

4663.56 --> 4668.4800000000005
that's what he did right in Newtonian

4665.42 --> 4671.719
mechanics were great it just excluded

4668.48 --> 4673.28
gas behavior that's all which is of

4671.719 --> 4675.08
course that's all what do you mean

4673.28 --> 4678.98
that's all that's like a third of

4675.08 --> 4680.48
everything yeah right indeed and it is

4678.98 --> 4683.299999999999
critical

4680.48 --> 4685.699
but if you can Overlook that then what

4683.3 --> 4687.26
he made out of it is kind of cool and

4685.699 --> 4688.879999999999
useful

4687.26 --> 4691.1
and

4688.88 --> 4693.8
it works well enough

4691.1 --> 4696.8
right an architect could use those

4693.8 --> 4699.02
Concepts and it works well enough very

4696.8 --> 4701.6
easy

4699.02 --> 4704.659000000001
right so that conception like oh there's

4701.6 --> 4705.92
a downward Factor this much

4704.659 --> 4709.879999999999
yeah

4705.92 --> 4712.88
kind of works out you can use that

4709.88 --> 4715.6990000000005
in architecture and engineering

4712.88 --> 4719.179
now as soon as you're going to have like

4715.699 --> 4721.94
gas pressure Dynamics or whatever

4719.179 --> 4725.54
get involved then it doesn't really work

4721.94 --> 4728.48
anymore that's the issue right

4725.54 --> 4730.88
but yeah most architecture doesn't

4728.48 --> 4733.5199999999995
really have any

4730.88 --> 4736.34
thing with gases right they don't have

4733.52 --> 4739.280000000001
isolated pressure

4736.34 --> 4742.1
it's usually just solids

4739.28 --> 4743.12
so Newtonian mechanic work works fine on

4742.1 --> 4745.219
that

4743.12 --> 4749.96
it's very useful

4745.219 --> 4753.08
but as a physics system like a real

4749.96 --> 4755.06
natural world description mechanism it's

4753.08 --> 4758.0599999999995
just incomplete it's always going to be

4755.06 --> 4760.2390000000005
incomplete and it was never complete you

4758.06 --> 4760.2390000000005
see

4760.46 --> 4764.6
and then at some point during Einstein's

4763.4 --> 4768.0199999999995
time

4764.6 --> 4771.320000000001
they just like okay we're going to just

4768.02 --> 4774.8
try to hand the solution as to this

4771.32 --> 4776.96
model that's not really complete but

4774.8 --> 4779.96
that we need

4776.96 --> 4782.0
for like the heliocentric religion

4779.96 --> 4784.46
so then he invented a completely new

4782.0 --> 4788.12
medium with math

4784.46 --> 4791.2390000000005
right Newton was at least trying to test

4788.12 --> 4794.12
his model empirically right he would do

4791.239 --> 4796.879999999999
things with objects to test it and

4794.12 --> 4799.58
measure it and calculate it

4796.88 --> 4802.400000000001
Einstein is just pure conceptual it's

4799.58 --> 4805.46
like he didn't do anything other than

4802.4 --> 4807.86
maybe draw some numbers up on paper

4805.46 --> 4810.86
like Einstein never did any empirical

4807.86 --> 4813.32
testing for his supposed gravity ever it

4810.86 --> 4814.88
was just a calculation system and that's

4813.32 --> 4817.159
all

4814.88 --> 4820.76
yeah thank you by the way Chow you and

4817.159 --> 4823.4
Cat for the seven seven

4820.76 --> 4827.92
Super Chat donation

4823.4 --> 4827.92
he's not here he has risen

4831.679 --> 4834.34
okay

4836.179 --> 4838.78
all right

4838.82 --> 4844.04
happy Resurrection Sunday

4840.98 --> 4845.419999999999
that's right he's back that's hence the

4844.04 --> 4848.32
title of my show

4845.42 --> 4848.32
good to see you

4888.86 --> 4891.46
hmm

4892.73 --> 4897.5689999999995
[Music]

4901.52 --> 4906.200000000001
[Music]

4944.179 --> 4947.179
hmm

4948.98 --> 4953.9
find it difficult to explain to others

4951.139 --> 4956.78
yeah but it is difficult because the

4953.9 --> 4960.138999999999
issue isn't mechanical you see

4956.78 --> 4962.78
the issue is

4960.139 --> 4965.12
what it is actually what it actually is

4962.78 --> 4967.5199999999995
that is being taught like what is

4965.12 --> 4969.32
Newtonian mechanics right what is

4967.52 --> 4971.3
Einstein gravity

4969.32 --> 4973.34
that's the biggest problem is that

4971.3 --> 4976.58
people don't really understand what it

4973.34 --> 4979.58
is what it really represents

4976.58 --> 4981.199
so it is more really about historical

4979.58 --> 4983.3
knowledge about it

4981.199 --> 4985.638999999999
then even at how it's supposed to work

4983.3 --> 4987.1990000000005
because how Newtonian mechanics really

4985.639 --> 4988.76
works in the tail

4987.199 --> 4990.86
it's not really that important it is

4988.76 --> 4993.8
important to understand how he

4990.86 --> 4996.799999999999
established it through empirical testing

4993.8 --> 4999.139
so he did empiricism with it right he

4996.8 --> 5001.2390000000005
did absolutely test

4999.139 --> 5005.400000000001
the the math

5001.239 --> 5005.4
through physical testing

5006.159 --> 5010.96
right

5008.38 --> 5013.6
but yeah he didn't apply gas pressure

5010.96 --> 5015.639
thus it's not a complete model that

5013.6 --> 5018.9400000000005
could really represent

5015.639 --> 5021.58
the four mechanisms of nature

5018.94 --> 5026.919999999999
in the real world

5021.58 --> 5029.739
and he even disclaimed that he knew that

5026.92 --> 5032.139
yet it is being taught in school as if

5029.739 --> 5035.138999999999
like yeah

5032.139 --> 5038.56
nobody ever talks about him saying that

5035.139 --> 5041.38
it's just saying like that right

5038.56 --> 5043.42
it's important to know but people don't

5041.38 --> 5047.02
really move on though

5043.42 --> 5049.96
right so in the end it is like

5047.02 --> 5051.6990000000005
the mechanism is just kind of useful and

5049.96 --> 5053.86
people like it and then they don't

5051.699 --> 5056.5
really care

5053.86 --> 5059.08
that's the main issue is that people

5056.5 --> 5063.88
once they read like Newtonian mechanics

5059.08 --> 5066.5199999999995
isn't really complete they lose interest

5063.88 --> 5069.88
it's like they're like but this is kind

5066.52 --> 5073.120000000001
of understandable this is all empirical

5069.88 --> 5075.159000000001
why are you now telling me it's wrong

5073.12 --> 5078.639
why are you doing that to me now I'm I'm

5075.159 --> 5082.719
not interested anymore like oh

5078.639 --> 5084.58
it doesn't work well then I don't care

5082.719 --> 5086.62
and then they just forget about it and

5084.58 --> 5088.96
just like they learn still like oh no

5086.62 --> 5092.159
gravity into mechanics

5088.96 --> 5092.159
that just don't care

5105.4 --> 5108.4
Jesus

5114.1 --> 5117.1
what

5118.0 --> 5123.659
okay never heard that one before that's

5121.36 --> 5123.659
weird

5136.54 --> 5141.94
is that metaphorical or do you think

5139.12 --> 5145.78
it's like a a non-existent character

5141.94 --> 5149.5
that they designed to replace Jesus

5145.78 --> 5152.94
somehow tominoid like how is this how

5149.5 --> 5152.94
should I see what you just said

5158.98 --> 5163.678999999999
what are these wondrous Miracles you're

5161.26 --> 5163.679
talking about

5178.3 --> 5181.02
hmm

5184.42 --> 5189.88
character that takes biblical element

5186.639 --> 5192.1
well tominoid if I remember correctly he

5189.88 --> 5194.32
was actually really into like

5192.1 --> 5195.6990000000005
Christianity and especially esoterics

5194.32 --> 5198.34
and all that

5195.699 --> 5200.799999999999
and symbols he was like a whole called

5198.34 --> 5202.12
researcher and he was very deeply into

5200.8 --> 5205.139
the Bible

5202.12 --> 5205.139
so maybe

5205.54 --> 5212.32
that's just how he tried to be biblical

5209.8 --> 5214.6
right maybe he was trying to

5212.32 --> 5217.659
do that on purpose

5214.6 --> 5219.639
not to be like oh I want to be the Jesus

5217.659 --> 5221.5599999999995
of science

5219.639 --> 5223.719
right maybe they made him into but maybe

5221.56 --> 5226.2390000000005
he was just like oh this is how I honor

5223.719 --> 5230.02
Christ right I'm not gonna like screw

5226.239 --> 5233.259999999999
the church they're all just psychos and

5230.02 --> 5235.360000000001
like politicians I'm going to follow the

5233.26 --> 5238.4400000000005
path of Christ this way I'm going to be

5235.36 --> 5238.44
sheep farmer and

5239.02 --> 5243.3
the birthday thing is kind of remarkable

5241.0 --> 5243.3
though

5245.02 --> 5248.580000000001
like really the same birthday

5251.26 --> 5255.6
all of his signs Miracles yeah

5257.08 --> 5259.86
I don't know

5266.62 --> 5269.98
hit with the apollon knowledge yeah but

5268.6 --> 5272.1990000000005
that what does that have to do with

5269.98 --> 5274.919999999999
Jesus though right

5272.199 --> 5274.919999999999
serious

5275.199 --> 5280.48
nothing that's

5277.42 --> 5282.639
I take it a reference to Adam and Eve

5280.48 --> 5285.839999999999
that has nothing to do with Jesus not

5282.639 --> 5285.84
the same figure so

5286.42 --> 5293.679
right if you'd say biblically inspired

5290.38 --> 5296.1990000000005
well that only makes sense he was like

5293.679 --> 5299.62
an esoteric Christian eclectic he was

5296.199 --> 5302.5599999999995
just like I'm gonna do it my way

5299.62 --> 5304.659
right that doesn't mean like haha I'm

5302.56 --> 5305.620000000001
going to be a Jesus impersonator of

5304.659 --> 5309.94
science

5305.62 --> 5312.58
although yeah that people later ages

5309.94 --> 5315.4
ball Fanatics would have been like oh

5312.58 --> 5318.88
yeah this guy you know

5315.4 --> 5321.46
maybe he's our Jesus because they would

5318.88 --> 5324.159000000001
want to support the Bible unlike Newton

5321.46 --> 5326.9800000000005
pretty sure Newton didn't want that he

5324.159 --> 5330.659
just wanted to subvert the freaking

5326.98 --> 5330.659
priesthood power structure

5331.84 --> 5339.639
come on Newton how do you know turret

5336.639 --> 5342.58
there's literal letters multiple letters

5339.639 --> 5344.5
not just one there's a whole bunch of

5342.58 --> 5347.32
writing from Newton

5344.5 --> 5350.639
like with subject material how can you

5347.32 --> 5350.639
say he doesn't exist

5360.46 --> 5363.4800000000005
come on Terry

5372.28 --> 5379.54
not proof excuse me hand written letters

5377.34 --> 5382.42
a lot

5379.54 --> 5383.98
same handwriting from the same era on

5382.42 --> 5385.2390000000005
the same

5383.98 --> 5387.879999999999
time

5385.239 --> 5392.699
based paper

5387.88 --> 5392.6990000000005
that's not proof excuse me

5393.46 --> 5397.4800000000005
I don't understand

5395.08 --> 5402.94
like what is your

5397.48 --> 5406.36
what is your basis for accepting proof

5402.94 --> 5411.159
I meant not enough dude

5406.36 --> 5412.54
how how many stacks of paper do you need

5411.159 --> 5417.179
foreign

5412.54 --> 5417.179
I mean the guy wrote tons of letters

5419.199 --> 5423.219
it's evident to be fair but not proof

5421.6 --> 5425.1990000000005
yeah

5423.219 --> 5429.659
excuse me

5425.199 --> 5429.659
I'm sorry what else are you gonna get

5429.76 --> 5436.4800000000005
I mean you you need like a skeletal

5432.76 --> 5440.62
remain and then like what

5436.48 --> 5443.199
I mean letters guys letters what better

5440.62 --> 5446.199
type of proof

5443.199 --> 5448.0599999999995
letters about the subjects he was doing

5446.199 --> 5450.099999999999
like

5448.06 --> 5452.38
I don't get it

5450.1 --> 5457.0
the only alternative is that somebody

5452.38 --> 5459.52
like made massive effort massive to

5457.0 --> 5463.179
completely fake that character and

5459.52 --> 5465.06
simulate create it with

5463.179 --> 5468.76
tangible

5465.06 --> 5473.26
historical documents that are consistent

5468.76 --> 5475.84
with everything like that what the hell

5473.26 --> 5477.9400000000005
like that's more complicated than

5475.84 --> 5479.02
creating Shakespeare as a fictional

5477.94 --> 5482.08
character

5479.02 --> 5486.46
to supposedly write that

5482.08 --> 5490.98
that's more complex guys like what

5486.46 --> 5490.9800000000005
why why would anybody do that

5507.639 --> 5512.38
I think he was the top man in the well

5509.8 --> 5513.6990000000005
there you go even look if the if the

5512.38 --> 5516.34
person

5513.699 --> 5518.739
at some point you just gotta surrender

5516.34 --> 5522.04
to yeah you're never going to actually

5518.739 --> 5524.199
physically meet the guy okay if that is

5522.04 --> 5526.84
what you need like I want him to see him

5524.199 --> 5528.759999999999
living like he has to be a real person

5526.84 --> 5530.7390000000005
and I want to see him

5528.76 --> 5533.639
I want to see his dead body or something

5530.739 --> 5533.638999999999
right dude

5533.86 --> 5538.9
all that writing

5536.5 --> 5542.679
subject consistent

5538.9 --> 5544.44
right like singular person like at some

5542.679 --> 5547.2390000000005
point you're just going to have to admit

5544.44 --> 5550.599999999999
that's historically real

5547.239 --> 5555.159
not what people say about him

5550.6 --> 5558.9400000000005
but there was a person he left writing

5555.159 --> 5560.86
he was doing things in a time and that

5558.94 --> 5564.879999999999
time period and everything that came

5560.86 --> 5566.739
with it rubs off on what he left it has

5564.88 --> 5569.08
to be real

5566.739 --> 5571.48
good to be in doubt no it isn't it's not

5569.08 --> 5572.92
good to be in doubt when you shouldn't

5571.48 --> 5575.379999999999
be

5572.92 --> 5578.32
at some point you're going to just have

5575.38 --> 5581.08
to admit like no there at some point it

5578.32 --> 5583.12
just piles on and if it remains

5581.08 --> 5585.82
consistent the bigger the pile grows

5583.12 --> 5588.699
you're gonna have to admit it's real

5585.82 --> 5591.159
right if the pile grows and it all

5588.699 --> 5593.08
becomes super chaotic and on one side is

5591.159 --> 5596.259999999999
completely different than the other then

5593.08 --> 5598.239
I'd be like yeah that looks like it's a

5596.26 --> 5599.02
weird kind of pyramid scheme or

5598.239 --> 5602.44
something

5599.02 --> 5606.88
of History right but that's not the case

5602.44 --> 5609.638999999999
here his writings are very consistent

5606.88 --> 5612.400000000001
and there's a lot of it

5609.639 --> 5615.46
trust there's not experts this is just

5612.4 --> 5619.5
logical consistency

5615.46 --> 5621.34
just about logical consistency

5619.5 --> 5623.52
[Music]

5621.34 --> 5623.52
foreign

5624.72 --> 5627.77
[Music]

5636.82 --> 5640.78
and he didn't exist after all

5639.46 --> 5643.9
yeah

5640.78 --> 5648.219
well wouldn't it be more funny if it

5643.9 --> 5650.799999999999
turned out that the actual creation that

5648.219 --> 5653.62
we're sitting in is not older than 200

5650.8 --> 5656.56
years and that nothing ever existed

5653.62 --> 5658.239
including matter itself before 200 years

5656.56 --> 5662.139
ago yeah

5658.239 --> 5665.199
does that mean you need to be in doubt

5662.139 --> 5668.02
in the face of very persistent logical

5665.199 --> 5670.0
consistency no

5668.02 --> 5672.1
yeah what if

5670.0 --> 5674.98
if at some point what if is the only

5672.1 --> 5676.84
thing you got then you gotta take it

5674.98 --> 5679.54
which is still have to be logically

5676.84 --> 5681.159000000001
consistent with it that's the only way

5679.54 --> 5685.32
you're going to

5681.159 --> 5685.32
get the right end of it right

5686.86 --> 5692.199
otherwise you're just gonna end up like

5688.719 --> 5695.26
a solipsist and then everything becomes

5692.199 --> 5696.219
like no I don't believe it it might be

5695.26 --> 5698.8
fake

5696.219 --> 5700.54
what if there's something that you

5698.8 --> 5702.400000000001
didn't really think of that you really

5700.54 --> 5704.86
believed in and you're like yeah I'm on

5702.4 --> 5706.78
to that or what if somebody then told

5704.86 --> 5708.04
you like yeah but

5706.78 --> 5710.98
look

5708.04 --> 5715.179
it might not be real

5710.98 --> 5716.739
are you then honestly going to let it go

5715.179 --> 5719.32
no

5716.739 --> 5721.299999999999
I wouldn't

5719.32 --> 5724.48
because it's close to you right you're

5721.3 --> 5728.26
gonna have to let it go skepticism

5724.48 --> 5730.239
like absolute skepticism like that like

5728.26 --> 5731.860000000001
it could be fake so I can't believe in

5730.239 --> 5737.0199999999995
it

5731.86 --> 5737.0199999999995
somehow it could be fake a supposedly

5737.739 --> 5741.699
what's the point you're just gonna

5739.239 --> 5744.36
become solipsistic

5741.699 --> 5744.36
it's not good

5744.639 --> 5748.8
I'm convinced Newton is real

5749.08 --> 5753.58
weirdly enough got a lot of leads I had

5751.78 --> 5754.96
conversation with the guy in my

5753.58 --> 5757.239
divisions

5754.96 --> 5759.54
I was very into Newton also when I was

5757.239 --> 5759.54
younger

5760.36 --> 5767.98
and yes a lot was going down in that

5764.56 --> 5771.159000000001
time is Super mixed like the reporting

5767.98 --> 5774.94
on it is super mixed right and we say oh

5771.159 --> 5778.78
the church was oh fighting against

5774.94 --> 5781.48
science and this crazy heretic ideas and

5778.78 --> 5784.48
oh yeah really well we learned that it

5781.48 --> 5787.959999999999
was actually the church Catholicism that

5784.48 --> 5790.54
was introducing those [ __ ] ideas yeah

5787.96 --> 5793.679
they were literally top-down coordinated

5790.54 --> 5797.86
it wasn't some Fringe

5793.679 --> 5800.26
Fringe wizards no it was the [ __ ]

5797.86 --> 5803.739
Catholic Church yeah

5800.26 --> 5806.4400000000005
right well just because that is a rude

5803.739 --> 5808.5599999999995
switch around of reality does it mean

5806.44 --> 5812.138999999999
that nothing is real nothing no no

5808.56 --> 5815.139
people were there they were still doing

5812.139 --> 5818.7390000000005
their thing right despite the story

5815.139 --> 5821.679
about the entire context it's been a lie

5818.739 --> 5824.5
yeah it was absolutely there people did

5821.679 --> 5825.639
things Newton was right in the middle of

5824.5 --> 5828.219
all that

5825.639 --> 5832.679
you had to deal with it in his own way

5828.219 --> 5832.679
and he was probably a separatist

5833.44 --> 5837.219
he was a church separatist he was

5835.78 --> 5841.239
eclectic

5837.219 --> 5845.1
it would have to be if you're that smart

5841.239 --> 5845.099999999999
did aristotenuse exist

5846.46 --> 5851.92
well that's one figure that yeah there's

5849.52 --> 5853.900000000001
much more doubt about that right because

5851.92 --> 5856.9
there is almost nothing about him it's

5853.9 --> 5859.179
more like a myth story it's just

5856.9 --> 5861.58
he could have been just a conjured

5859.179 --> 5865.42
symbolic figure

5861.58 --> 5866.98
as far as I know right Newton has a huge

5865.42 --> 5870.54
amount of writing

5866.98 --> 5872.86
hand writing

5870.54 --> 5874.96
Aristotle's as far as I've heard and I

5872.86 --> 5877.54
haven't really dug into it or anything

5874.96 --> 5880.719
too deeply but on the surface from what

5877.54 --> 5884.44
I heard there's like nothing

5880.719 --> 5885.94
Batman yeah that's not historical

5884.44 --> 5888.28
terminoid

5885.94 --> 5891.04
yeah

5888.28 --> 5893.259999999999
that's not historical that's literal

5891.04 --> 5896.44
fictional writing

5893.26 --> 5900.46
that's not letters with addresses and

5896.44 --> 5904.599999999999
stamps and locations and payment systems

5900.46 --> 5907.06
involved and everything registers

5904.6 --> 5909.88
yeah

5907.06 --> 5912.580000000001
that's not fiction if it's completely

5909.88 --> 5916.08
integrated into the real world with

5912.58 --> 5919.54
contemporary situations and Technology

5916.08 --> 5922.98
that's not fiction that's something that

5919.54 --> 5922.98
literally happened there

5923.139 --> 5928.6
right this is not some random piece of

5926.5 --> 5931.239
paper somebody found

5928.6 --> 5934.0
in it in a chest

5931.239 --> 5935.86
although he has a lot of writing that he

5934.0 --> 5939.219
probably did keep in the chest but he's

5935.86 --> 5943.739
sent letters he's received letters from

5939.219 --> 5943.7390000000005
different figures from that time

5948.46 --> 5955.179
so yeah Newton was real I'm very certain

5951.94 --> 5957.04
all these figures that are like weirdly

5955.179 --> 5959.92
involved with heliocentrism out there

5957.04 --> 5962.8
I'm very certain that Newton was real

5959.92 --> 5964.0
and I'm also certain he was actually a

5962.8 --> 5966.159000000001
good guy

5964.0 --> 5969.04
not perfect he might have done some

5966.159 --> 5972.04
weird dubious [ __ ] at some point

5969.04 --> 5974.8
out of curiosity it seems like he's an

5972.04 --> 5976.48
overall good guy in nature

5974.8 --> 5979.4800000000005
and he was rebellious against

5976.48 --> 5979.48
authoritarianism

5980.86 --> 5985.839999999999
and I like him I think he's awesome

5983.8 --> 5987.6990000000005
I'm a fan of Newton

5985.84 --> 5991.0
what can you do

5987.699 --> 5993.36
what I've allowed myself to become a fan

5991.0 --> 5993.36
of him

5994.0 --> 5998.679
and then face like oh but what if he

5995.92 --> 6000.6
wasn't real I faced that okay like when

5998.679 --> 6002.219
this whole Flat Earth thing happened oh

6000.6 --> 6004.26
yeah people just say oh nudes fake

6002.219 --> 6006.06
they're all fake and I'm like

6004.26 --> 6009.360000000001
really

6006.06 --> 6012.4800000000005
is that true and I dug a bit and then it

6009.36 --> 6015.119
became a subject also on fed and there's

6012.48 --> 6016.678999999999
just a whole bunch of writing there's a

6015.119 --> 6019.5599999999995
whole bunch of writing historical

6016.679 --> 6020.6990000000005
letters that have woman stamped and all

6019.56 --> 6024.54
that [ __ ]

6020.699 --> 6026.78
like that can't you can't just fake all

6024.54 --> 6026.78
that

6026.82 --> 6032.0
no way

6028.44 --> 6032.0
it's a registered person

6032.04 --> 6038.28
so no I like Newton and I think he is

6036.3 --> 6040.1990000000005
real I think there's sufficient

6038.28 --> 6042.96
historical evidence to prove that he was

6040.199 --> 6045.178999999999
a real person in that era busying

6042.96 --> 6047.04
himself with well what we know now is

6045.179 --> 6051.119
Newtonian mechanics

6047.04 --> 6054.36
astrology and esoteric Christianity and

6051.119 --> 6055.619
some occult research and all that so

6054.36 --> 6058.199
yeah

6055.619 --> 6060.119
I think he's real

6058.199 --> 6062.82
doesn't mean that others like

6060.119 --> 6067.28
aristotonies are also real because well

6062.82 --> 6069.719
they have so very little historic

6067.28 --> 6071.82
evidence-based references

6069.719 --> 6075.44
right if there's nothing about a person

6071.82 --> 6075.44
then is he real right

6075.54 --> 6080.28
if you can't even name like their place

6077.639 --> 6082.679
of birth and in there is no registry of

6080.28 --> 6087.659
that person ever

6082.679 --> 6091.32
orders like other stories like sometimes

6087.659 --> 6093.0
you got folklore myths right and like a

6091.32 --> 6095.34
village somewhere in the middle of

6093.0 --> 6098.88
nowhere can just or in a more popular

6095.34 --> 6101.34
populated region can just make up like a

6098.88 --> 6103.38
local myth of a guy that's like amazing

6101.34 --> 6106.860000000001
and he does something

6103.38 --> 6109.139
and then that they can basically make a

6106.86 --> 6112.619
stories up about that that become like

6109.139 --> 6115.32
official like a a totem of the town

6112.619 --> 6117.239
well then much much later like hundreds

6115.32 --> 6119.58
of years later

6117.239 --> 6121.379999999999
somebody could basically screw with that

6119.58 --> 6124.199
and say like oh that was a real person

6121.38 --> 6125.88
look at all this evidence yeah

6124.199 --> 6128.28
but

6125.88 --> 6130.679
if you then go by the original records

6128.28 --> 6133.5
it would have still shown that it's

6130.679 --> 6136.619
actually a myth

6133.5 --> 6137.46
like Robin Hood exactly Robin Hood is a

6136.619 --> 6140.339999999999
myth

6137.46 --> 6141.9
so folklore myth very popular though

6140.34 --> 6143.58
right

6141.9 --> 6147.719
it's even more likely if they're very

6143.58 --> 6149.5199999999995
popular that they are actually folklore

6147.719 --> 6152.34
because it's they people create

6149.52 --> 6155.52
something that they need

6152.34 --> 6158.58
an idea an ideal and then you make a

6155.52 --> 6163.46
story and then there's use that story

6158.58 --> 6163.46
to like to spice up their morality

6164.1 --> 6170.1
right but

6167.1 --> 6171.719
if they're real then there will be

6170.1 --> 6175.26
registered

6171.719 --> 6176.88
physical real life interactions of that

6175.26 --> 6178.8
person right

6176.88 --> 6180.6
that's a whole different type of

6178.8 --> 6183.179
evidence

6180.6 --> 6185.639
and Newton has that evidence

6183.179 --> 6188.639
luckily enough like what if Newton was

6185.639 --> 6190.679
like 200 years before that might have

6188.639 --> 6192.36
been a lot more difficult to find proper

6190.679 --> 6194.0
evidence

6192.36 --> 6196.679
right

6194.0 --> 6200.1
because he was right in that time period

6196.679 --> 6204.36
where things were getting industrious

6200.1 --> 6205.679
like not industrial era industrious

6204.36 --> 6207.36
but just

6205.679 --> 6209.6990000000005
Renaissance

6207.36 --> 6212.94
where suddenly communication and writing

6209.699 --> 6215.4
was all getting more refined and

6212.94 --> 6216.48
and there was just more success more

6215.4 --> 6219.54

6216.48 --> 6222.0

6222.0 --> 6226.46
exotic Goods

6223.92 --> 6226.46
right

6230.699 --> 6235.08
anyway I guess that's enough about

6233.1 --> 6239.42
Newton

6235.08 --> 6239.42
Tycho bride didn't exist I don't know

6242.699 --> 6245.36
I don't know

6245.94 --> 6249.138999999999
why would you say that

6260.58 --> 6266.82
I mean you look at this point you can't

6264.26 --> 6269.6
just say

6266.82 --> 6273.659
it was fake that's not a real person

6269.6 --> 6276.780000000001
unless you have like direct leads

6273.659 --> 6278.879999999999
to that you can't just start pointing at

6276.78 --> 6281.46
things saying oh it's fake

6278.88 --> 6283.7390000000005
that kind of makes you a conspiratory if

6281.46 --> 6288.06
you do that if you don't have very

6283.739 --> 6290.339999999999
direct leads why they would be fake not

6288.06 --> 6291.84
because they were wrong or they're wrong

6290.34 --> 6297.1990000000005
now

6291.84 --> 6297.1990000000005

what dude you do realize that that's

6328.86 --> 6333.679
just a spot

6331.679 --> 6337.139
in the numerous

6333.679 --> 6339.54
numerological order right I mean there

6337.139 --> 6341.88
would have been a lot of people born in

6339.54 --> 6345.619
1666.

6341.88 --> 6345.619

whatever man I don't know I don't even

6366.42 --> 6369.36
know if that ever really happened like

6368.28 --> 6372.239
that

6369.36 --> 6374.82
like that or maybe they Unleashed it on

6372.239 --> 6378.839999999999
purpose because of numerological worship

6374.82 --> 6380.82
maybe they were trying to invoke that

6378.84 --> 6384.6
but that doesn't mean oh if something

6380.82 --> 6388.259999999999
somebody was born in 6066 that means

6384.6 --> 6391.139
he's fake it's a plant it's just oh it's

6388.26 --> 6396.84
just fake no

6391.139 --> 6396.84
people were actually born in 1666.

6399.48 --> 6405.98
can't you realize it could have just

6401.46 --> 6405.9800000000005
been on that date too

6406.38 --> 6413.1
a number is not a lead I mean it might

6410.34 --> 6417.2390000000005
Rouse a bit of Suspicion right it's like

6413.1 --> 6419.76
hmm okay I get it I get especially now

6417.239 --> 6421.638999999999
in this era where like numerology like

6419.76 --> 6425.04
that is constantly slapped in your face

6421.639 --> 6427.5
that doesn't automatically mean it's

6425.04 --> 6431.88
that is the number

6427.5 --> 6433.86
of somebody's birthday birth date that

6431.88 --> 6436.5
that automatically means if they're all

6433.86 --> 6440.28
faked I mean a lot of people were still

6436.5 --> 6440.28
born in 6066.

[Music]

6658.619 --> 6666.48
please start man

6662.28 --> 6668.84
but I wonder cyber I wonder then

6666.48 --> 6672.0
all the plague started

6668.84 --> 6675.7390000000005
when did it start saying that

6672.0 --> 6675.739
seriously when

6677.34 --> 6680.96
did it always say that

6681.239 --> 6687.839999999999
somebody should look like in uh

6684.54 --> 6691.5
old encyclopedias paper encyclopedias

6687.84 --> 6692.639
and actually look up the plague medieval

6691.5 --> 6695.219
plague

6692.639 --> 6698.4800000000005
where did it start will it actually say

6695.219 --> 6698.4800000000005
it started in China

6699.9 --> 6705.78
and if not when did they start saying

6702.48 --> 6708.54
that was that like a recent update

6705.78 --> 6712.38
are they now saying that it started in

6708.54 --> 6714.36
China supposedly now they know

6712.38 --> 6717.119
that's

6714.36 --> 6719.4
quite remarkable

6717.119 --> 6721.44
because I've never heard anybody say

6719.4 --> 6724.259999999999
that before

6721.44 --> 6727.138999999999
right as far as I know

6724.26 --> 6730.04
plague was kind of just a mystery where

6727.139 --> 6730.04
it really started

6732.719 --> 6735.5
supposedly

6738.659 --> 6743.339999999999
personally I think that it is not even

6741.48 --> 6747.259999999999
like

6743.34 --> 6747.26
I think it's probably just

6748.82 --> 6754.5599999999995
mostly because of terrain Theory effects

6752.34 --> 6757.7390000000005
it went completely out of control

6754.56 --> 6760.26
because of the terrible conditions that

6757.739 --> 6762.48
the people lived in

6760.26 --> 6766.8
right terrible living conditions

6762.48 --> 6768.839999999999
conditions terrible hygiene the rats

6766.8 --> 6774.4400000000005
right you know

6768.84 --> 6774.4400000000005
rat feces is a hazard is a health hazard

6774.719 --> 6779.219
understand so if red fishes constantly

6777.48 --> 6781.86
gets involved

6779.219 --> 6784.56
in food production for example like

6781.86 --> 6786.0
bread making that's really it starts to

6784.56 --> 6788.96
pile up

6786.0 --> 6794.099
like this sort of allergens

6788.96 --> 6794.099
inflam yeah inflammation burdening

6794.159 --> 6801.659
right so if then yeah people get sick

6798.96 --> 6804.3
because of a rat plague and then they

6801.659 --> 6806.04
start to blame the cats

6804.3 --> 6808.5
and then kill them

6806.04 --> 6810.179
because they're [ __ ] retards and

6808.5 --> 6813.42
sadists

6810.179 --> 6816.06
yeah guess what's gonna happen more rats

6813.42 --> 6820.86
right let's just

6816.06 --> 6823.4400000000005
and that's also what just pisses me off

6820.86 --> 6825.54
when I saw that [ __ ] from Shanghai that

6823.44 --> 6828.119
they're actually just freaking killing

6825.54 --> 6829.5
pets including cats

6828.119 --> 6831.96
like

6829.5 --> 6834.9
you're you're doing it on purpose

6831.96 --> 6837.84
they're doing it on purpose they're

6834.9 --> 6841.08
literally making a field

6837.84 --> 6844.5
a feudal sorry move

6841.08 --> 6847.199
they're literally trying to like

6844.5 --> 6849.0
do that [ __ ] again

6847.199 --> 6851.638999999999
right

6849.0 --> 6853.8
in the Modern Age it's crazy

6851.639 --> 6855.599
they're just trying to create toxic

6853.8 --> 6858.320000000001
conditions so that [ __ ] like that

6855.599 --> 6858.32
happens again

6860.219 --> 6865.92
and who knows maybe even back then maybe

6863.04 --> 6870.42
they did that on purpose too right maybe

6865.92 --> 6874.5
the plague broke out because of satanic

6870.42 --> 6874.5
you get proto-eugenics

6874.56 --> 6881.159000000001
freaks they were like yeah we got the

6878.04 --> 6884.5199999999995
power now let's literally starve

6881.159 --> 6886.44
everybody and get them sick right oh oh

6884.52 --> 6888.179
they yeah they want sewers well guess

6886.44 --> 6890.699
what we're not gonna build that for you

6888.179 --> 6893.4
you can go [ __ ] yourselves

6890.699 --> 6895.5599999999995
and we're gonna take most of your food

6893.4 --> 6897.0599999999995
and we're gonna blame the cats for

6895.56 --> 6900.3
disease

6897.06 --> 6901.619000000001
so let them get sick then they all start

6900.3 --> 6905.820000000001
to die

6901.619 --> 6907.98
and then we can blame it as a curse on

6905.82 --> 6909.54
our political opponent and then go to

6907.98 --> 6911.5199999999995
war with them

6909.54 --> 6913.38
yeah

6911.52 --> 6915.780000000001
and then everybody's gonna be all

6913.38 --> 6918.900000000001
religious like oh it's a religious War

6915.78 --> 6922.0199999999995
wow everybody dies that's staying behind

6918.9 --> 6923.339999999999
pretty much from the conditions

6922.02 --> 6925.8
right

6923.34 --> 6927.3
that's what I think they were doing and

6925.8 --> 6928.92
in a way it's almost like that's

6927.3 --> 6931.08
happening again

6928.92 --> 6933.42
and if you realize that a lot of the

6931.08 --> 6936.599
mechanisms of what is taking place is

6933.42 --> 6938.52
effectively neo-fugalism

6936.599 --> 6940.92
then

6938.52 --> 6942.84
it's not even like an analogy anymore

6940.92 --> 6945.96
it's just like yeah that's literally

6942.84 --> 6947.9400000000005
what it is it's literally that that's

6945.96 --> 6951.659
literally what's happening

6947.94 --> 6953.879999999999
this is the same [ __ ] tactics being

6951.659 --> 6958.0199999999995
applied from medieval

6953.88 --> 6960.96
nobility [ __ ] their their their peons

6958.02 --> 6964.38
over like literally trying to make

6960.96 --> 6966.719
people into peons again that if they

6964.38 --> 6971.04
wanted the nobility they could literally

6966.719 --> 6974.28
just like hack a citizen to death right

6971.04 --> 6976.98
on the street as nobility and nobody

6974.28 --> 6980.58
could do [ __ ] about it

6976.98 --> 6982.98
right people wouldn't even please don't

6980.58 --> 6986.159
do that ask they wouldn't even back to

6982.98 --> 6988.678999999999
them because they knew like these people

6986.159 --> 6991.138999999999
just they hate everybody they're

6988.679 --> 6994.7390000000005
practically demon-possessed and they

6991.139 --> 6997.7390000000005
don't give a [ __ ] about anybody else but

6994.739 --> 6999.78
they're [ __ ] little nobility Circle

6997.739 --> 7003.259999999999
and it seems like that's

6999.78 --> 7006.259999999999
the new trend of today

7003.26 --> 7008.900000000001
with the new oligarchy whatever you're

7006.26 --> 7010.76
gonna call them the nouveau riche

7008.9 --> 7012.86
it's the old the new thing they think

7010.76 --> 7014.96
they're the new nobility and they want a

7012.86 --> 7017.48
neo-fuel system and they're doing it

7014.96 --> 7021.7390000000005
they're doing the same actions that led

7017.48 --> 7025.58
to the same conditions and scenarios of

7021.739 --> 7028.759999999999
medieval times we're getting there right

7025.58 --> 7030.98
now except now we got this magical

7028.76 --> 7034.639
scrying devices

7030.98 --> 7036.98
that we summarize as media so we can

7034.639 --> 7039.38
actually see it

7036.98 --> 7043.339999999999
see it Beyond

7039.38 --> 7045.139
the still seemingly good well taken care

7043.34 --> 7047.2390000000005
of region we can just see what's

7045.139 --> 7050.119
happening we can see them doing it now

7047.239 --> 7052.699
we don't have to be a traveler to know

7050.119 --> 7055.639
that and then spread the word by word of

7052.699 --> 7058.58
mouth in taverns now we got this weird

7055.639 --> 7061.52
scrying devices with which we can just

7058.58 --> 7064.659
instantly communicate this

7061.52 --> 7064.659000000001
that's the big difference

7069.619 --> 7074.0599999999995
hey Mr Cheswick good to see you yeah I'm

7072.139 --> 7077.84
doing pretty good

7074.06 --> 7080.119000000001
I am almost almost fully recovered I'd

7077.84 --> 7083.4800000000005
say like two more days and it probably

7080.119 --> 7084.619
maybe more maybe three or probably not

7083.48 --> 7086.54
even like

7084.619 --> 7088.759999999999
I wouldn't even know that it ever

7086.54 --> 7091.219
happened

7088.76 --> 7093.92
so it's definitely

7091.219 --> 7097.28
in the yeah in the better healing phase

7093.92 --> 7099.8
and I feel like static

7097.28 --> 7102.139
I really feel great in such beautiful

7099.8 --> 7105.38
weather man it's amazing look it's it's

7102.139 --> 7108.28
even more beautiful than

7105.38 --> 7108.28
look at this

7110.06 --> 7114.9400000000005

7112.04 --> 7114.94
astounding

7116.36 --> 7118.9

7122.239 --> 7126.759999999999

7198.44 --> 7204.678999999999
good good right good point

7201.02 --> 7207.38
what if they just turn it off

7204.679 --> 7208.52
what if they just closed it off

7207.38 --> 7210.56
right

7208.52 --> 7214.3
what if

7210.56 --> 7214.3
they blamed it

7214.82 --> 7221.48
or maybe also possibility maybe their

7218.599 --> 7225.5
sewer systems actually got like really

7221.48 --> 7227.299999999999
invaded by rat plagues like that at

7225.5 --> 7229.88
first it wasn't too much of a problem

7227.3 --> 7233.42
but that they didn't take good enough

7229.88 --> 7235.76
care of it clean it out enough

7233.42 --> 7238.88
and that then

7235.76 --> 7241.52
it did become like infested with rats

7238.88 --> 7243.92
and then they might have just not known

7241.52 --> 7245.2390000000005
how to deal with it and they just closed

7243.92 --> 7249.6990000000005
it off

7245.239 --> 7249.699
and like okay we're closing it off

7249.92 --> 7254.96
and then it didn't go away

7252.56 --> 7257.179
but they were like not gonna open it up

7254.96 --> 7258.7390000000005
because like like thousands of rat would

7257.179 --> 7260.719
be shooting up

7258.739 --> 7262.218999999999
starting attacking people or something

7260.719 --> 7264.02
right

7262.219 --> 7266.42
I don't know but it is a good question

7264.02 --> 7269.3
though like how did they not have sewers

7266.42 --> 7272.06
there at that time in general

7269.3 --> 7274.159000000001
like how could that be

7272.06 --> 7276.4400000000005
right if it would have been during the

7274.159 --> 7278.54
mud flood era which is much later that

7276.44 --> 7280.82
would be like explainable because like

7278.54 --> 7283.58
yeah oh the sewer suddenly got buried in

7280.82 --> 7284.48
mud like yeah you don't you can't reach

7283.58 --> 7287.36
it

7284.48 --> 7289.82
right

7287.36 --> 7291.739
something like that or giant earthquakes

7289.82 --> 7293.96
or something

7291.739 --> 7297.138999999999
but

7293.96 --> 7299.719
yeah they they didn't really seem to be

7297.139 --> 7302.5
using it

7299.719 --> 7302.5
at all

7303.5 --> 7308.26
and I really do Wonder like how could

7305.78 --> 7308.259999999999
that be

7308.78 --> 7311.92
it is curious

7328.04 --> 7333.58
it's it's me it might be something to be

7331.84 --> 7336.4400000000005
worthwhile

7333.58 --> 7337.82
digging into actually

7336.44 --> 7340.339999999999
like

7337.82 --> 7341.54
what happened in medieval times with the

7340.34 --> 7344.599
sewer system

7341.54 --> 7346.46
that might be actually a worthwhile Ruta

7344.599 --> 7351.099
Discovery for those that are kind of

7346.46 --> 7351.099
good at historical digging I am not

7351.32 --> 7355.78
I get everything through everybody else

7353.179 --> 7355.78
pretty much

7358.76 --> 7363.9400000000005
but yeah

7360.38 --> 7363.9400000000005
I'm curious about that now

7366.199 --> 7372.138999999999
so if anybody finds any interesting

7368.42 --> 7376.0
leads on that please let me know

7372.139 --> 7376.0
and we might learn something more

7404.72 --> 7407.829000000001
[Music]

7409.46 --> 7417.199
by the way seriously the person

7412.88 --> 7420.1990000000005
that originally came up with like

7417.199 --> 7423.259999999999
water guided sewer systems

7420.199 --> 7425.299999999999
is a freaking genius

7423.26 --> 7428.780000000001
like that's like one of the most

7425.3 --> 7430.76
brilliant inventions man has ever made I

7428.78 --> 7432.5599999999995
think really when you think about it

7430.76 --> 7434.84
long when you think about it long enough

7432.56 --> 7437.360000000001
then you realize that that's absolutely

7434.84 --> 7438.5
true like what are you gonna do without

7437.36 --> 7440.36
it

7438.5 --> 7443.0
this is

7440.36 --> 7446.299999999999
you're not gonna come that far like

7443.0 --> 7450.079
without a sewer system building

7446.3 --> 7453.1990000000005
a populated dense area is always going

7450.079 --> 7454.88
to turn into a nightmare as [ __ ] smelly

7453.199 --> 7457.879999999999
nightmare

7454.88 --> 7457.88
enigenic

7459.26 --> 7461.7390000000005
right

7462.02 --> 7464.7390000000005
brilliant

7473.48 --> 7477.379999999999
mm-hmm

7475.159 --> 7479.239
yes like Barrett that's funny you say

7477.38 --> 7481.9400000000005
that I actually did say that like about

7479.239 --> 7483.5599999999995
five minutes ago that I think that might

7481.94 --> 7485.659
have been the issue

7483.56 --> 7488.719
that they just closed it off that they

7485.659 --> 7491.179
blamed it for something

7488.719 --> 7493.639
but maybe it was just pure evil maybe it

7491.179 --> 7496.46
was just like yeah

7493.639 --> 7499.42
you can't use it anymore which is like

7496.46 --> 7499.42
yeah

7499.699 --> 7503.78
you

7501.079 --> 7506.78
you just can't use shoes anymore now

7503.78 --> 7508.219
right maybe it was just like a fee a

7506.78 --> 7510.92
feudal move

7508.219 --> 7514.34
where they were just like excessively

7510.92 --> 7518.06
just like exerting power like yeah you

7514.34 --> 7520.6990000000005
can't use the sewers anymore now peons

7518.06 --> 7522.4400000000005
like yeah you figure it out or like

7520.699 --> 7525.5599999999995
choke on your own feet it's like super

7522.44 --> 7528.759999999999
hard Super Evil

7525.56 --> 7528.76
maybe that was it

7529.34 --> 7535.34
maybe that was actually how it happened

7531.5 --> 7538.28
I'd like to know more about it is there

7535.34 --> 7541.9400000000005
historical references to the sewer

7538.28 --> 7545.44
system and why people weren't using them

7541.94 --> 7545.44
I'd be very interested

7571.07 --> 7574.2
[Music]

7584.84 --> 7590.2390000000005
right so I'm glad you guys are catching

7587.659 --> 7594.44
on to this this is something interesting

7590.239 --> 7597.379999999999
to be figured out right this is like a

7594.44 --> 7598.579
a research project that people that are

7597.38 --> 7601.46
interested

7598.579 --> 7603.619
in the past could actually perform

7601.46 --> 7605.54
because it seems like it's all kind of

7603.619 --> 7607.4
weird from what I'm getting now in

7605.54 --> 7610.36
feedback in the chat thank you very much

7607.4 --> 7610.36
for that by the way

7629.0 --> 7632.659
really how's the house domestics I get

7631.699 --> 7635.36
that

7632.659 --> 7636.739
Emma

7635.36 --> 7639.5199999999995
right

7636.739 --> 7641.718999999999
but even such

7639.52 --> 7643.579000000001
non-domestic sewer system would have

7641.719 --> 7647.9800000000005
already

7643.579 --> 7647.98
been just much better for everybody

7648.38 --> 7651.6990000000005
so did they have that

7652.28 --> 7656.0199999999995
in those times in the plague times

7656.42 --> 7661.76
I mean was like maybe maybe I'm just

7659.659 --> 7663.92
getting it not in a complete picture

7661.76 --> 7667.34
maybe they did have like

7663.92 --> 7672.56
a sewer system that's like in the street

7667.34 --> 7675.38
and you just like throw it into a hole

7672.56 --> 7678.9800000000005
which is like a bigger pipe sewer system

7675.38 --> 7681.02
then is that how they did it because I

7678.98 --> 7683.919999999999
got imagery where people would literally

7681.02 --> 7686.599
just throw it in a moat on the street

7683.92 --> 7690.4
like that was their sewer system which

7686.599 --> 7690.400000000001
is like potentially disastrous

7693.079 --> 7697.04
right

7695.0 --> 7699.139
because it's going to literally be

7697.04 --> 7702.26
exposed to the air constantly

7699.139 --> 7705.679
like that and thus all the good fumes

7702.26 --> 7707.96
and whatever bad not good

7705.679 --> 7711.219
especially if suddenly people get sick

7707.96 --> 7711.219
all at the same time

7722.54 --> 7726.639
basil get I don't know what that means

7740.3 --> 7746.360000000001
oh bjcina that's interesting

7744.32 --> 7749.5599999999995
that's another way to think about that

7746.36 --> 7749.5599999999995
very interesting

7769.82 --> 7772.42
hmm

7784.94 --> 7787.94
interesting

7799.88 --> 7802.88
hmm

7803.84 --> 7808.6990000000005
right Emma Peel yeah yeah

7806.599 --> 7811.099
that's the thing you know

7808.699 --> 7813.199
the Romans like within the boundaries of

7811.099 --> 7816.679
their own empire were constantly

7813.199 --> 7819.86
updating they were super industrious and

7816.679 --> 7821.2390000000005
they would update their [ __ ] right they

7819.86 --> 7825.799999999999
would build

7821.239 --> 7828.138999999999
their devices to accommodate certain

7825.8 --> 7831.079000000001
amounts of people and then oh this is

7828.139 --> 7834.76
growing well you have to then update and

7831.079 --> 7837.619
they would do it right they would update

7834.76 --> 7841.52
architecture constantly they would they

7837.619 --> 7844.4
had a lot of building going on a lot

7841.52 --> 7846.9800000000005
but yeah if then another

7844.4 --> 7849.739
in another era people would use their

7846.98 --> 7851.718999999999
stuff and then grow in population they

7849.739 --> 7853.759999999999
aren't gonna update it

7851.719 --> 7855.56
that's right because they're not the

7853.76 --> 7857.179
designers of it

7855.56 --> 7859.280000000001
and then they just think like oh yeah

7857.179 --> 7861.4400000000005
sure it could take more no no it can't

7859.28 --> 7862.88
and the original designer would have

7861.44 --> 7865.28
known that

7862.88 --> 7868.84
right but he didn't build it to

7865.28 --> 7868.84
accommodate for a Metropole

7868.88 --> 7871.88
interesting

7876.98 --> 7880.36
hey Goldie mckernan

7905.3 --> 7908.02
hmm

7947.119 --> 7953.598999999999
right anyway yeah all these gross things

7950.3 --> 7955.88
you know it is still very

7953.599 --> 7958.6990000000005
interesting

7955.88 --> 7960.619
for me to think about like

7958.699 --> 7962.96
it's like yeah people don't want to

7960.619 --> 7966.5
think about that but somebody has to

7962.96 --> 7968.119
right somebody has to and I think it's

7966.5 --> 7971.0
interesting it's it's kind of weird

7968.119 --> 7974.119
maybe I have like a bit of a sewer

7971.0 --> 7976.46
architecture thing inside of me like

7974.119 --> 7980.119
even when I would be like

7976.46 --> 7983.4800000000005
uh if for my DND game like designing

7980.119 --> 7986.239
castles right I would always be like

7983.48 --> 7989.839999999999
okay somebody's gonna be living there

7986.239 --> 7991.759999999999
how where are they gonna [ __ ] right I

7989.84 --> 7993.619000000001
would always build in toilets and like

7991.76 --> 7995.4800000000005
really think about that every time

7993.619 --> 7997.94
because it's like yeah

7995.48 --> 8001.419999999999
that's gonna happen

7997.94 --> 8005.28
you can't just not just imagine like

8001.42 --> 8005.28
people don't do that they do

8014.38 --> 8018.36
right so how are you gonna do it

8030.46 --> 8032.639
foreign

8043.01 --> 8046.289000000001
[Music]

8053.139 --> 8057.76
I'm really glad that it turned out into

8055.48 --> 8060.699
a show like this

8057.76 --> 8063.4800000000005
because it started out kind of like

8060.699 --> 8063.48
yeah

8063.94 --> 8068.138999999999
started out like bad news but this is

8066.219 --> 8071.02
cool stuff this is interesting to talk

8068.139 --> 8074.76
about first talk about Newton

8071.02 --> 8074.76
how do you know somebody's real

8075.04 --> 8082.5
and how about sewer systems and Romans

8078.099 --> 8082.5
and why the plague how did that happen

8082.96 --> 8086.94
I'm still interested in it like

8098.98 --> 8103.54
like also why wasn't anything being done

8102.46 --> 8105.639
about it

8103.54 --> 8107.739
didn't like they had a lot of people

8105.639 --> 8110.079
right people

8107.739 --> 8112.0
the Romans would basically consider that

8110.079 --> 8114.34
a slave but the Romans would just use

8112.0 --> 8116.38
people to build all their [ __ ] whether

8114.34 --> 8119.5
they were slaves

8116.38 --> 8122.7390000000005
well yeah or just building like

8119.5 --> 8125.679
professional builders

8122.739 --> 8128.079
I understand why

8125.679 --> 8130.3
if it was getting so much more populated

8128.079 --> 8132.4
in those times

8130.3 --> 8135.9400000000005
why the

8132.4 --> 8138.879999999999
leadership or whatever didn't just say

8135.94 --> 8141.638999999999
like okay we're gonna have to expand

8138.88 --> 8145.56
this sewer system and just like okay

8141.639 --> 8145.56
you're gonna do it now people

8149.079 --> 8154.0
so

8150.46 --> 8158.02
didn't they expand it on purpose like a

8154.0 --> 8161.56
Eugenics or proto-eugenics move

8158.02 --> 8164.5
or were they simply incompetent

8161.56 --> 8167.320000000001
and kind of like oh no it'll be fine

8164.5 --> 8169.36
whatever for whatever reason

8167.32 --> 8171.88
which one would have would it have been

8169.36 --> 8173.5
right I thought always like no they did

8171.88 --> 8175.0
it on purpose they just wanted to kill

8173.5 --> 8176.8
everybody off

8175.0 --> 8179.079
but

8176.8 --> 8181.3
is there even like any historically

8179.079 --> 8184.48
recorded

8181.3 --> 8186.46
letters about that or anything that

8184.48 --> 8187.419999999999
actually indicates that they did it on

8186.46 --> 8189.219
purpose

8187.42 --> 8191.56
I'm not sure

8189.219 --> 8194.679
I mean it makes sense to me

8191.56 --> 8196.719000000001
but it could also just be gross gross

8194.679 --> 8199.2
incompetence

8196.719 --> 8199.199999999999
so

8202.0 --> 8205.26
apparently they had flush

8206.019 --> 8210.84
wow

8208.12 --> 8210.84
what the [ __ ]

8215.319 --> 8220.74
why are you getting that from flatter

8217.359 --> 8220.74
Sage that's surreal

8232.78 --> 8239.399000000001
hmm no I have not heard of that Terror

8235.899 --> 8239.399
306 sounds interesting

8268.0 --> 8270.54
hmm

8272.859 --> 8279.519
okay yeah what

8275.139 --> 8282.88
if just Wiki is all you got that's

8279.519 --> 8285.460000000001
unless it has some actual palpable leads

8282.88 --> 8287.559
or evidence supposedly like what did

8285.46 --> 8289.419999999998
they find one

8287.559 --> 8292.24
how was it established that it was

8289.42 --> 8293.38
actually a functioning toilet flush

8292.24 --> 8296.139
system

8293.38 --> 8299.199999999999
and that it was that old like how what

8296.139 --> 8302.259999999998
where what's the actual lead right

8299.2 --> 8305.019
just Wiki saying that it is there it's

8302.26 --> 8307.979
not really helpful unless they have well

8305.019 --> 8307.979
some leads

8334.059 --> 8341.018999999998
hmm

8336.28 --> 8341.019
King minnows of great cool

8349.3 --> 8352.559
right yeah yeah

8352.719 --> 8358.779999999999
I agree yeah Tarot

8356.38 --> 8363.3
like there was really Advanced Water

8358.78 --> 8363.300000000001
Management in very old times

8363.399 --> 8368.559
where they even had like understanding

8365.8 --> 8371.619999999999
of like how Stone and

8368.559 --> 8374.199999999999
everything influences it so there has

8371.62 --> 8377.019
been a lot of like knowledge about how

8374.2 --> 8378.819000000001
to deal and store water from very

8377.019 --> 8380.62
ancient times from the times where the

8378.819 --> 8384.46
technology was more focused on like

8380.62 --> 8385.660000000002
electricity and the abilities of stone

8384.46 --> 8388.72
right

8385.66 --> 8391.06
a lot of technology has flown forth from

8388.72 --> 8393.279999999999
that era

8391.06 --> 8396.24
but the more time passes the more has

8393.28 --> 8396.24
been lost about it

8397.359 --> 8401.74
that very sophisticated Water Management

8399.58 --> 8404.399
Systems in ancient times like very

8401.74 --> 8404.399
ancient times

8404.8 --> 8409.92
the the evidence is just there

8407.26 --> 8409.92
still there

8410.38 --> 8416.0
[Music]

8439.3 --> 8441.96
hmm

8443.859 --> 8449.380000000001
yeah good one Matthew Matthew all that

8446.8 --> 8451.479
is indeed yeah dude

8449.38 --> 8454.479
you can make it like an improvisation

8451.479 --> 8458.319
toilet indeed with like

8454.479 --> 8461.199999999999
just a a bucket system scooping up water

8458.319 --> 8464.74
like that and then on a on a pipe so

8461.2 --> 8467.58
yeah all kinds of things

8464.74 --> 8467.58
fascinating

8469.66 --> 8474.06
oh look we got an empty alert

8484.66 --> 8487.2
hmm

8495.7 --> 8498.479000000001
what

8500.14 --> 8506.519999999999
to feel the Avatar The Last piece what

8503.08 --> 8506.52
are you talking about tarot

8508.0 --> 8514.479
why would I think that

8510.52 --> 8518.819000000001
and even if I did like how

8514.479 --> 8518.819
it's so far away

8519.16 --> 8522.84
I mean like

8523.66 --> 8529.899
a weird question to ask

8526.84 --> 8533.319
how is it historical

8529.899 --> 8536.68
like what how where where is it where's

8533.319 --> 8539.5
the history where's any lead of that

8536.68 --> 8541.92
that that's like literally what was

8539.5 --> 8541.92
happening

8542.02 --> 8545.460000000001
yeah of course I've seen it

8549.04 --> 8555.580000000002
but that's not the point though you

8551.92 --> 8558.52
asked me like actual history like what

8555.58 --> 8561.479
where are you getting that from why why

8558.52 --> 8561.479000000001
