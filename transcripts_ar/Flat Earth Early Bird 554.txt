521.59 --> 533.0400000000001
a lot and yeah some of you might have

525.97 --> 536.74
seen the Brian had a live presentation

533.04 --> 540.1899999999999
Nathan's yesterday it was it was a bit

536.74 --> 542.59
long in the sense that yeah he expected

540.19 --> 544.8100000000001
what it was going to be that it was

542.59 --> 548.26
going to be extremely technical and he

544.81 --> 550.8399999999999
was gonna have problems like keeping it

548.26 --> 553.63
all together because of just the thick

550.84 --> 556.63
the yeah the concentration of data that

553.63 --> 558.46
he had gathered so yeah the story

556.63 --> 561.67
structure was a bit lacking but the

558.46 --> 563.1700000000001
technical data was very rich and he knew

561.67 --> 565.39
we was going to have a bit of a problem

563.17 --> 568.2099999999999
with presenting it

565.39 --> 574.43
but yeah he I thought he did a great job

568.21 --> 577.6600000000001
and yeah I was on there as well but yeah

574.43 --> 581.81
I didn't say too much because I was just

577.66 --> 584.51
very audibly drunk this is like my mind

581.81 --> 592.0999999999999
was still I was my mind was doing fine

584.51 --> 596.18
it's just an jazzy con the voice this is

592.1 --> 597.9200000000001
I was almost like damn I'm so drunk

596.18 --> 600.8599999999999
maybe I should just act like I'm jazz

597.92 --> 603.92
akanda it was kind of silly so I just

600.86 --> 609.62
stopped because he would yeah I was just

603.92 --> 613.52
distracting the trolls a lot I don't

609.62 --> 615.71
know what that is sometimes the alcohol

613.52 --> 621.0699999999999
it doesn't really slow my mind down it

615.71 --> 623.63
just slows down my tongue just get all

621.07 --> 629.21
it's almost literally like my muscles

623.63 --> 637.76
get tired it's odd how that works I will

629.21 --> 640.94
I was pickled I love drunk I guess it

637.76 --> 646.81
can be a bit it can be a bit fun but the

640.94 --> 649.1
problem is I'm just yeah like as a

646.81 --> 659.0
information conveyor I'm not as

649.1 --> 662.15
effective I think but yeah unless I feel

659.0 --> 665.56
like I'm really stumbling bad I'm

662.15 --> 666.86
usually pretty happy or happy I'm just

665.56 --> 671.3299999999999
yeah

666.86 --> 673.7
I think somehow call me does as long as

671.33 --> 677.09
I don't hang on to that for a very long

673.7 --> 680.6600000000001
time you know if I just let it be this

677.09 --> 684.94
moment yeah I'm having a lot of fun at

680.66 --> 689.0899999999999
it it's also in a way like being able to

684.94 --> 692.12
put down the responsibility up to a

689.09 --> 694.13
certain degree for a moment and just

692.12 --> 697.36
being able to have fun just soaking

694.13 --> 697.36
things up like that

699.35 --> 708.4200000000001
but yeah I should I shouldn't do that so

703.71 --> 710.45
regularly in a way I'm I'm trying to cut

708.42 --> 710.4499999999999
down

711.26 --> 726.42
hmm but yeah yesterday yeah that's right

722.99 --> 730.35
pickled hammer it's loaded pissed drunk

726.42 --> 735.5899999999999
as a skunk er okay mm-hmm well at least

730.35 --> 738.59
yeah I sound very drunk but the thing is

735.59 --> 744.3000000000001
I'm not even gonna be tested on this but

738.59 --> 748.0500000000001
like I can keep my balance up to amazing

744.3 --> 750.4799999999999
levels when I'm drunk like amazing not

748.05 --> 754.6099999999999
saying that I can court dance well I can

750.48 --> 759.15
barely even court dance when I'm sober

754.61 --> 761.67
but I don't get unbalanced only thing is

759.15 --> 764.91
is that my muscles all get a little bit

761.67 --> 766.74
more was it

764.91 --> 770.4
yeah they feel like they're a bit tired

766.74 --> 775.35
but yeah my balance does it I don't lose

770.4 --> 778.56
it unless like it's really spinning but

775.35 --> 782.48
that only happens when I yeah drink too

778.56 --> 782.4799999999999
much and I rarely do that

791.05 --> 794.05
lubricated

802.98 --> 808.26
comes back to what you're drinking yeah

805.29 --> 811.91
and also how well you're eating next to

808.26 --> 815.61
that for me

811.91 --> 820.709
drinking it can be a bit of a hassle

815.61 --> 826.5600000000001
because also it's it kind of feeds me I

820.709 --> 828.5999999999999
guess there yeah and that makes me often

826.56 --> 830.91
less hungry I'll be more inclined to

828.6 --> 833.16
just skip a meal but yeah if you don't

830.91 --> 837.54
if you do that too often it's just not

833.16 --> 840.66
healthy at all because you do need kind

837.54 --> 843.36
of a some food in there as well that's

840.66 --> 846.36
better for your body when you drink I'll

843.36 --> 849.32
go like drinking on an empty stomach is

846.36 --> 849.32
not good

857.07 --> 868.019
but yeah yesterday I was I was basically

860.759 --> 870.029
drinking wine red wine Evelina before

868.019 --> 872.43
that I was drinking beer I just had two

870.029 --> 875.069
beers and I had an extra bottle of wine

872.43 --> 878.2199999999999
and it just was really in the mood for

875.069 --> 881.13
it and it like it felt good it's funny

878.22 --> 885.9300000000001
how that works for some reason red wine

881.13 --> 890.759
as long as I don't overdo it it syncs

885.93 --> 893.6099999999999
better maybe it's because of the that

890.759 --> 894.47
there is like certain types of what is

893.61 --> 898.6800000000001
it

894.47 --> 901.139
substances in there that that can be

898.68 --> 904.2299999999999
used effectively as sort of a vitamin C

901.139 --> 908.009
situation and beer doesn't have that

904.23 --> 911.399
much beer is like liquid bread it does

908.009 --> 914.37
feed you but yeah it doesn't really add

911.399 --> 919.889
any kind of vitamin situation or

914.37 --> 924.18
anything the red wine yeah can be

919.889 --> 926.779
actually nutritious if you eat properly

924.18 --> 926.779
with it

932.68 --> 939.529
so yeah I had some pasta yesterday like

937.36 --> 942.13
what is it how do you call that like

939.529 --> 945.579
those noodle things with spinach in and

942.13 --> 949.389
and yeah and some red wine along it was

945.579 --> 949.3889999999999
it was very nice

953.8 --> 960.2299999999999
alright so despite all that drink I feel

957.399 --> 962.18
because I have had technically a

960.23 --> 967.9590000000001
substantial amount of alcohol yesterday

962.18 --> 970.6389999999999
but despite that I feel fine yeah I

967.959 --> 973.04
don't even have a hangover I don't have

970.639 --> 976.279
some thing in my head where it feels

973.04 --> 978.769
like ooh my head feels like it's a

976.279 --> 987.829
hammer or something no not at all

978.769 --> 989.87
I think I did feel a little bit more

987.829 --> 992.93
sweaty than usual I think that is what

989.87 --> 996.339
red wine does when it's warm so I didn't

992.93 --> 996.3389999999999
also get a shower

1000.85 --> 1018.16
anyway I'm just talking about nothing

1007.059 --> 1027.029
now uh so tortellinis right right yeah I

1018.16 --> 1029.289
like those sometimes it's like yeah

1027.029 --> 1032.289
tortellinis with some spinach in them

1029.289 --> 1035.1
and I put some ketchup on there it's a

1032.289 --> 1035.1
really great combination

1039.029 --> 1043.5
all organic of course by the way

1047.959 --> 1056.8990000000001
trying to get [ __ ] up okay yeah that's

1053.419 --> 1061.5200000000002
like that's chugging that's basically to

1056.899 --> 1070.899
get the drunken States to to seek the

1061.52 --> 1070.899
release yeah I don't drink like that

1071.169 --> 1076.94
like when I drink it I'm usually

1074.27 --> 1080.779
engaging it something like watching the

1076.94 --> 1085.549
show watching a program or having a

1080.779 --> 1088.46
conversation you know often I break open

1085.549 --> 1091.49
a beer when the Flat Earth debate after

1088.46 --> 1093.26
show is over and then like yes us guys

1091.49 --> 1096.429
hanging back they're like Brian and

1093.26 --> 1100.8799999999999
chocolate and at a meeting sometimes and

1096.429 --> 1102.98
and then yeah we we sometimes have long

1100.88 --> 1105.3500000000001
conversations afterwards not always you

1102.98 --> 1107.1490000000001
know now that everybody has the time but

1105.35 --> 1109.49
sometimes we just hang around there for

1107.149 --> 1111.7099999999998
an hour and it's it's great fun it's

1109.49 --> 1115.51
almost a waste that it's not being

1111.71 --> 1115.51
recorded but it's just between us

1117.73 --> 1123.409
because yeah we try out almost like

1120.919 --> 1127.8700000000001
on-the-spot presentation explanations

1123.409 --> 1131.2700000000002
about things all the time it's like

1127.87 --> 1134.51
giving a small presentation is just a

1131.27 --> 1138.039
thing that you do eventually when you

1134.51 --> 1138.039
learn about all of this so many times

1152.23 --> 1156.94
check skype messages okay

1172.11 --> 1179.0089999999998
huh

1174.69 --> 1185.029
all right yeah I'll keep your identity

1179.009 --> 1188.039
to put to ourselves yeah

1185.029 --> 1192.779
you want to talk at some point sure why

1188.039 --> 1198.299
not want to discuss it just over Skype

1192.779 --> 1202.259
that's fine but yeah I'm I'm doing the

1198.299 --> 1205.259
show now so maybe after the show

1202.259 --> 1206.669
somewhere although I'll probably go out

1205.259 --> 1212.039
for groceries

1206.669 --> 1214.46
right after I end the show it should be

1212.039 --> 1217.529
in at least another hour

1214.46 --> 1217.529
[Music]

1219.81 --> 1223.329
[Music]

1229.66 --> 1238.1100000000001
what what are you talking about a minion

1232.81 --> 1238.11
you used to three-year-olds

1247.299 --> 1252.22
walk toolbar sober everything looks crap

1250.149 --> 1257.6399999999999
few beers later it's the best place ever

1252.22 --> 1257.64
I don't know

1267.22 --> 1278.94
oh you were a juggler - Amanda you all

1276.73 --> 1278.94
right

1285.1 --> 1291.2199999999998
I don't know I never really used to do

1287.98 --> 1296.35
that because it I just respond so bad to

1291.22 --> 1299.6200000000001
it you know I like drinking alcohol in

1296.35 --> 1301.9599999999998
the day especially just never really

1299.62 --> 1307.03
hits well it was like never it always

1301.96 --> 1311.919
just liked to warm and [ __ ] and just

1307.03 --> 1314.59
makes me feel very poisoned but yeah

1311.919 --> 1316.929
back in the day I didn't like chug

1314.59 --> 1320.35
drinks but what I did do is like yeah

1316.929 --> 1324.72
smoke joints a lot I was like dad that

1320.35 --> 1326.82
was all the thing you know like when I

1324.72 --> 1329.559
was 18

1326.82 --> 1334.6589999999999
yeah coffee shops were like really a

1329.559 --> 1337.78
thing now so it was like open up like

1334.659 --> 1340.8090000000002
that that yeah you could do that instead

1337.78 --> 1342.6689999999999
of being a drinker you could be a kind

1340.809 --> 1345.309
of a smoker and I want to was one of

1342.669 --> 1347.26
those and I've met many people that kind

1345.309 --> 1351.7
of were into that or would like to try

1347.26 --> 1356.8799999999999
that and so I was usually the guy

1351.7 --> 1359.6200000000001
rolling joints I'm very good at it but

1356.88 --> 1362.2
I've never really been like a party

1359.62 --> 1365.02
drinker I would drink some but I would

1362.2 --> 1367.53
then usually end up just rolling a lot

1365.02 --> 1367.53
of joints

1374.35 --> 1383.83
yeah besides most people like when they

1380.71 --> 1388.57
drink a lot it usually doesn't really

1383.83 --> 1390.82
lead to good things anyway you know it's

1388.57 --> 1393.1899999999998
pretty universal that the more alcohol

1390.82 --> 1398.049
you get that most people just become

1393.19 --> 1402.5800000000002
dumb and yeah they may experience that

1398.049 --> 1404.649
as having fun but yeah it's only in

1402.58 --> 1411.789
their minds pretty much that it's a lot

1404.649 --> 1414.0089999999998
of fun at that moment and yeah I don't

1411.789 --> 1417.73
know I've never had much fun of that Wow

1414.009 --> 1418.929
when you smoke it's when everybody's

1417.73 --> 1421.509
smoking is something completely

1418.929 --> 1423.669
different happens some people experience

1421.509 --> 1426.3700000000001
like personal issues you know some

1423.669 --> 1428.95
people may get bad Trapster [ __ ] but

1426.37 --> 1432.07
often the people that do they see that

1428.95 --> 1434.669
coming eventually there's a field and

1432.07 --> 1436.75
the moment you know there's something

1434.669 --> 1438.669
especially when I was younger it's just

1436.75 --> 1440.5
important to know like is this a good

1438.669 --> 1442.8090000000002
moment to smoke or should I not do it

1440.5 --> 1444.73
depending on like the inner chemistry

1442.809 --> 1449.1689999999999
and a lot of people didn't realize that

1444.73 --> 1451.96
I didn't realize it that well because I

1449.169 --> 1454.45
would just smoke a lot even like when I

1451.96 --> 1457.509
probably shouldn't and that was a big

1454.45 --> 1459.5800000000002
problem for me really because I yeah I

1457.509 --> 1462.6390000000001
effectively did use it as an escapist

1459.58 --> 1464.32
tool and it would also make people break

1462.639 --> 1466.6899999999998
away from me because they just noticed

1464.32 --> 1472.59
that guy is kind of like addicted to

1466.69 --> 1475.6290000000001
smoking he's not very sociable alright

1472.59 --> 1478.629
but on the other hand there were groups

1475.629 --> 1484.62
of people that would yeah kind of loved

1478.629 --> 1486.9089999999999
it and even want an excuse to basically

1484.62 --> 1489.059
yeah move up to me and start a

1486.909 --> 1492.97
conversation under those conditions

1489.059 --> 1496.0
because yeah if I don't know for me

1492.97 --> 1499.929
smoking together with other people has

1496.0 --> 1502.52
been for me mostly an opportunity to get

1499.929 --> 1505.89
close to people

1502.52 --> 1508.3799999999999
because and everybody's drinking you get

1505.89 --> 1509.91
stupid when everybody's smoking yeah

1508.38 --> 1512.5200000000002
they may get some personal issues but

1509.91 --> 1514.919
people rarely get really stupid unless

1512.52 --> 1517.74
they start in like a blabbering fast

1514.919 --> 1519.8400000000001
because some people get can get like

1517.74 --> 1523.19
Getti and extremely talky and they don't

1519.84 --> 1527.61
shut up that's kind of annoying this is

1523.19 --> 1530.46
but not a lot of them and most people

1527.61 --> 1534.9289999999999
kind of just are able to pay more

1530.46 --> 1538.08
attention they're more able to zoom into

1534.929 --> 1540.71
a story and hey guess what I'm a

1538.08 --> 1543.6299999999999
storyteller I tell a lot of stories so

1540.71 --> 1546.72
for me that was always yeah it's like

1543.63 --> 1553.0490000000002
yeah if I smoke a lot of people listen

1546.72 --> 1558.799
to me yeah but anyway I'm not like that

1553.049 --> 1562.23
anymore and I don't I wouldn't advertise

1558.799 --> 1564.84
being like a cannabis smoker in just

1562.23 --> 1569.07
person-to-person social contact anymore

1564.84 --> 1571.4399999999998
i would admit that i am a smoker but i

1569.07 --> 1576.45
try to keep it out of the social

1571.44 --> 1579.0
interactions as much as possible that's

1576.45 --> 1582.57
just how I do it now I'm not like a

1579.0 --> 1585.539
proud smoker that's like yeah smoking

1582.57 --> 1589.53
joints is a social affair you should

1585.539 --> 1592.95
just do it like that no but I do think

1589.53 --> 1596.3999999999999
that there is there's special thing to

1592.95 --> 1598.14
just having a smoking circle you know

1596.4 --> 1600.419
sitting in the garden somewhere and

1598.14 --> 1602.3090000000002
doing that and having conversation or

1600.419 --> 1604.409
just relaxing yeah there's something to

1602.309 --> 1608.76
that but that's for a moment it's not

1604.409 --> 1611.5490000000002
something that should be the default but

1608.76 --> 1614.78
I started out thinking that that that

1611.549 --> 1617.85
was the default because it was my entry

1614.78 --> 1620.1299999999999
into having social connections where

1617.85 --> 1623.039
before I would just be isolated and not

1620.13 --> 1626.0100000000002
know what the [ __ ] to say and that is

1623.039 --> 1629.37
kind of still a problem because I can be

1626.01 --> 1631.35
like hello I'm always very polite I open

1629.37 --> 1633.57
doors for people I'm like never gonna

1631.35 --> 1634.83
get in somebody's way like a feral most

1633.57 --> 1639.1499999999999
neurotic about it

1634.83 --> 1642.1799999999998
but s to really like reaching out and

1639.15 --> 1645.1200000000001
really trying to address somebody more

1642.18 --> 1646.29
personally that's like that that makes

1645.12 --> 1653.1
me very nervous

1646.29 --> 1656.19
like yeah it's different always was a

1653.1 --> 1657.9599999999998
bit troubling for me and there's people

1656.19 --> 1660.6000000000001
out there that just do it they just do

1657.96 --> 1662.67
it instantly they don't have any

1660.6 --> 1665.9399999999998
objections they don't have any problems

1662.67 --> 1669.0900000000001
doing that and you can feel it about

1665.94 --> 1671.46
them but that comes with an entire

1669.09 --> 1675.36
setting of doing things and being in a

1671.46 --> 1680.04
certain way and that's not available to

1675.36 --> 1682.56
me due to how I am what I do it just

1680.04 --> 1687.56
doesn't work for my spiritual chemistry

1682.56 --> 1690.1799999999998
as well so for me I don't know really

1687.56 --> 1693.71
getting to know somebody is a big deal

1690.18 --> 1693.71
it kind of always has been

1699.47 --> 1710.74
baller sound drunk everyday oh that chai

1704.57 --> 1713.48
key know that chai key what a weird of a

1710.74 --> 1715.4
chai tea yesterday sounded literally

1713.48 --> 1719.83
like he was on some kind of new

1715.4 --> 1719.8300000000002
medication or something he said like I

1722.23 --> 1727.4
don't know what he's on but it just

1725.75 --> 1729.61
sounds like he's tripping half of the

1727.4 --> 1729.6100000000001
time

1742.68 --> 1745.8690000000001
[Music]

1757.419 --> 1768.789
right a gem yeah and another issue that

1762.099 --> 1774.489
I've kind of noticed is the distance of

1768.789 --> 1781.989
people in general that it seems like so

1774.489 --> 1785.32
many people especially like women around

1781.989 --> 1789.809
their 30s I think and maybe 20s but

1785.32 --> 1789.809
especially around 30s for some reason

1789.899 --> 1795.9089999999999
they're very rejected rejecting it seems

1794.649 --> 1800.139
it's something that I've started

1795.909 --> 1803.0990000000002
noticing it's like many women just seem

1800.139 --> 1806.9189999999999
to be very rejecting of a lot of people

1803.099 --> 1809.019
and for some political thing or maybe

1806.919 --> 1811.7990000000002
their mood is just out of control or

1809.019 --> 1815.6490000000001
something something squirty is

1811.799 --> 1818.969
preventing them from just being nice and

1815.649 --> 1818.9689999999998
open to people

1825.88 --> 1835.179
right I don't not all of them though

1830.37 --> 1838.7099999999998
it's just something I don't know maybe

1835.179 --> 1847.77
they're just rejecting me because I'm I

1838.71 --> 1852.669
I don't look like a standard [ __ ] I try

1847.77 --> 1855.07
not to look like that but on the other

1852.669 --> 1859.3600000000001
hand yeah there's been so many people

1855.07 --> 1864.1
that many there's been is that your crow

1859.36 --> 1867.2199999999998
no there is no crow the crows have yeah

1864.1 --> 1870.1
mr. crow Georgie haven't seen him in a

1867.22 --> 1873.159
long time so he's been gone for for a

1870.1 --> 1874.8999999999999
long time now these are the jackdaws and

1873.159 --> 1879.2800000000002
there's a jacked off family still in

1874.9 --> 1881.049
there in the chimney and I think it's

1879.28 --> 1884.5
like one of the Young's is like in his

1881.049 --> 1886.6589999999999
teenage phase so he's very chatty and a

1884.5 --> 1888.549
lot of other jackdaws come to visit and

1886.659 --> 1894.1200000000001
then everybody's yeah you start to hear

1888.549 --> 1894.12
that get very chatty

1903.5 --> 1911.18
yet that so what you're hearing is is

1907.61 --> 1916.76
daddy that's that's dad's voice

1911.18 --> 1918.97
it's like dad being nice I recognize the

1916.76 --> 1918.97
sound

1923.47 --> 1930.25
because he doesn't sound like that when

1925.389 --> 1931.9289999999999
he's addressing other jackdaws because

1930.25 --> 1934.57
he does guard the place he's like

1931.929 --> 1937.1200000000001
constantly showy puffing himself of the

1934.57 --> 1939.61
just show like hey hello it's it's okay

1937.12 --> 1948.9699999999998
but this is my territory you have to be

1939.61 --> 1949.769
aware of that but that little sound

1948.97 --> 1952.69
there

1949.769 --> 1955.679
that's the sound he makes when he kind

1952.69 --> 1955.679
of talks to the lil one

1966.14 --> 1969.14
okay

1972.93 --> 1981.39
what nationality is Brian I'm pretty

1978.04 --> 1981.3899999999999
sure he's Irish

1990.929 --> 2000.1290000000001
Oh God really

1995.07 --> 2000.129
what is a Karen Oh God

2006.49 --> 2015.35
yeah Karen that's the word they gave to

2009.919 --> 2019.8200000000002
typical women better like over 40 or

2015.35 --> 2022.37
something that are very much cut to to

2019.82 --> 2025.84
like government policy dance including

2022.37 --> 2029.9899999999998
the corona situation so yeah did they

2025.84 --> 2033.1689999999999
know certain types of people as a meme

2029.99 --> 2035.9
started calling it Karen's like your

2033.169 --> 2037.76
Karen if you complain to other people

2035.9 --> 2040.48
that they're not social distancing

2037.76 --> 2040.48
enough and all that

2048.69 --> 2057.98
that's a Karen apparently it's been used

2054.6 --> 2057.98
for a few years is it

2083.38 --> 2087.6
no idea what you're talking about a gym

2100.27 --> 2106.57
right yeah George Sanford I think it's

2102.61 --> 2114.06
mostly a an England thing there's a lot

2106.57 --> 2114.06
of Carens in England those types that is

2116.88 --> 2121.9900000000002
although I think that in the United

2119.35 --> 2130.0299999999997
States especially in the big city areas

2121.99 --> 2134.7999999999997
there's also plenty of huh yes

2130.03 --> 2138.3
hm I know Paul Joseph Watson is always

2134.8 --> 2138.3
on to those types of memes

2149.03 --> 2152.159
[Music]

2174.44 --> 2179.91
yes AGM I did watch the video i watch

2177.78 --> 2182.8100000000004
his videos every every time they come

2179.91 --> 2185.2799999999997
out pretty much the minute they come out

2182.81 --> 2192.74
then subscribe to his channel for a long

2185.28 --> 2192.7400000000002
time but I can't say I fell off my chair

2206.619 --> 2215.7290000000003
my wife all their sister sisters in-laws

2210.089 --> 2215.729
all Karen's okay goody

2222.16 --> 2228.43
you know what I think that this this

2224.95 --> 2240.3689999999997
meme of the karent's kind of falls under

2228.43 --> 2244.299
the category of like the the grassroot

2240.369 --> 2248.069
blabbers like they're they're not any a

2244.299 --> 2252.43
rich blabla or something but it's like

2248.069 --> 2255.25
the blabla format that is like a natural

2252.43 --> 2257.6499999999996
consequence of just copying [ __ ] off

2255.25 --> 2262.72
Society in taking over bad habits from

2257.65 --> 2269.579
media [ __ ] so it's like a Karen would be

2262.72 --> 2269.5789999999997
like a damn i blabla yeah

2277.9 --> 2290.32
Carla always doing stupid is that a Karl

2285.02 --> 2290.32
I this is okay if you say so you have I

2294.61 --> 2301.04
thought that was like renamed into a

2297.17 --> 2306.53
Leroy because that's been such as a

2301.04 --> 2310.2799999999997
familiar example now you know Leroy

2306.53 --> 2314.8
Jenkins it's like you haven't heard of

2310.28 --> 2318.3500000000004
that then I don't know

2314.8 --> 2325.4300000000003
and Karl is probably a very old

2318.35 --> 2328.9
terminology that's right that belongs to

2325.43 --> 2328.8999999999996
World of Warcraft that's correct

2343.44 --> 2351.119
right but if you're gonna say don't be a

2346.02 --> 2356.0389999999998
Leroy then it's much much more likely

2351.119 --> 2360.869
that anybody I don't know pretty much of

2356.039 --> 2364.23
any age up until like 50 at least should

2360.869 --> 2365.46
know what that means instantly if you're

2364.23 --> 2367.859
gonna say a Karl

2365.46 --> 2370.4700000000003
well yeah you might have some old

2367.859 --> 2372.39
veterans soldiers or something that are

2370.47 --> 2374.609
going to be like oh yeah the Karl yeah

2372.39 --> 2376.3489999999997
yeah nobody talks about that anymore

2374.609 --> 2379.859
because everybody's in the computer

2376.349 --> 2385.6090000000004
games now but yeah that's probably more

2379.859 --> 2385.609
more an old block phrase

2454.56 --> 2458.23
[Music]

2482.66 --> 2485.5299999999997
hmm

2491.82 --> 2499.0
and it was such another age wasn't it

2496.41 --> 2503.98
like television back then they were

2499.0 --> 2509.32
really at times just putting in effort

2503.98 --> 2514.06
to to bring out good educational little

2509.32 --> 2516.67
things at times to really try to get a

2514.06 --> 2524.19
message across for the better you know

2516.67 --> 2527.14
and all of that has changed so much like

2524.19 --> 2534.07
there's no yeah it doesn't really happen

2527.14 --> 2536.14
anymore like now there's no loose little

2534.07 --> 2539.56
things no it's all placed into this

2536.14 --> 2544.93
wider context of how reality is supposed

2539.56 --> 2546.0299999999997
to be now in the modern world and it's

2544.93 --> 2552.3999999999996
different

2546.03 --> 2554.7400000000002
so yeah in the old days on the

2552.4 --> 2558.2200000000003
television sometimes there were just

2554.74 --> 2560.3489999999997
these moments of just genuine goodness

2558.22 --> 2564.43
and a good advising wisdom that would

2560.349 --> 2567.7000000000003
shine through that were real now it's

2564.43 --> 2569.47
kind of tough to find and a lot of the

2567.7 --> 2574.0299999999997
times when you think you found something

2569.47 --> 2576.75
like that you end up weirdly feeling

2574.03 --> 2579.9100000000003
like somehow it has been artificially

2576.75 --> 2583.33
arranged to specifically be like that

2579.91 --> 2587.41
just to manipulate you and not because

2583.33 --> 2592.69
it's just a genuine human moment I don't

2587.41 --> 2594.97
know if ya see more of that like

2592.69 --> 2597.599
artificial morality or not natural

2594.97 --> 2597.5989999999997
morality

2607.63 --> 2611.08
no swearing

2616.25 --> 2623.83
right well they're respecting parents

2618.53 --> 2626.69
and elders was always very complicated

2623.83 --> 2628.34
because what about them do you respect

2626.69 --> 2632.15
you know and that's always the issue

2628.34 --> 2635.3900000000003
with kids they always get stuck up on on

2632.15 --> 2639.56
the parts that they can't respect about

2635.39 --> 2640.94
their parents and then overlook a lot of

2639.56 --> 2643.16
the times the things that they should

2640.94 --> 2647.81
respect about them because they're

2643.16 --> 2654.52
staring blind at the bad parts typical

2647.81 --> 2654.52
teenage mode and back in the day

2654.609 --> 2660.83
well concerning the age the information

2658.28 --> 2662.9300000000003
that was the ad the age of illusions

2660.83 --> 2665.41
breaking open more than ever you know

2662.93 --> 2667.73
moon-landing [ __ ] and hippies and

2665.41 --> 2670.52
parents really didn't know what the [ __ ]

2667.73 --> 2676.01
to do with that they didn't really have

2670.52 --> 2678.89
a proper answer like they didn't have a

2676.01 --> 2680.6600000000003
good answer to the Revolution the

2678.89 --> 2683.48
Cultural Revolution that was being

2680.66 --> 2686.48
unleashed on them on their kids they

2683.48 --> 2687.68
didn't have an answer to it they didn't

2686.48 --> 2690.8
know what the hell to do with it they

2687.68 --> 2693.6499999999996
just had the old mechanisms and yeah the

2690.8 --> 2697.7000000000003
revolution mentally out did so much and

2693.65 --> 2700.099
just and on the other hand also drug

2697.7 --> 2703.0989999999997
people in just completely away from

2700.099 --> 2705.73
being decent and all that as well as it

2703.099 --> 2705.73
was chaos

2705.75 --> 2712.51
[Music]

2708.21 --> 2715.39
so chorus Socrates complained about the

2712.51 --> 2718.92
youths back in the day I bet he did this

2715.39 --> 2718.92
I bet he did

2723.38 --> 2728.96
[Music]

2725.96 --> 2733.69
but yeah I think that people should keep

2728.96 --> 2736.73
this in mind that in the 60s and 70s

2733.69 --> 2742.309
there was so much cultural revolution

2736.73 --> 2747.26
happening that most parents just didn't

2742.309 --> 2750.559
have an answer to what was happening to

2747.26 --> 2755.71
the world and their kids they didn't

2750.559 --> 2758.9900000000002
really know how to deal with it and that

2755.71 --> 2763.19
created more chaos that set more of the

2758.99 --> 2767.089
kids adrift into the weird Cultural

2763.19 --> 2768.8
Revolution which also tires eventually

2767.089 --> 2770.7799999999997
gets tied in some really creepy things

2768.8 --> 2775.849
as we all know the Tavistock Institute

2770.78 --> 2777.26
has a great and in the whole thing and

2775.849 --> 2781.099
with it

2777.26 --> 2783.7400000000002
dark influences and just on purpose

2781.099 --> 2791.599
manipulation towards a not so bright

2783.74 --> 2794.049
future except for those in control of

2791.599 --> 2794.049
the dream

2814.679 --> 2819.67
all right I have it look I think there's

2817.9 --> 2823.109
something interesting about that whole

2819.67 --> 2827.9790000000003
thing about why teenagers typically

2823.109 --> 2830.709
rebel in a way they need to you know

2827.979 --> 2833.9489999999996
there's a purpose to it it a development

2830.709 --> 2837.219
process of which that is a part because

2833.949 --> 2840.9990000000003
yeah it's also the time when the kid

2837.219 --> 2847.049
starts to realize this ego then

2840.999 --> 2850.839
eventually they may be in control and

2847.049 --> 2855.369
then they seek out the flaws of the old

2850.839 --> 2858.699
order to try and out climb that but in

2855.369 --> 2861.069
doing so they often overlook wisdom it's

2858.699 --> 2862.809
natural because you got to break

2861.069 --> 2864.67
everything down to get a clear new

2862.809 --> 2869.079
picture that's that's kind of how that

2864.67 --> 2872.529
works but yeah if a teenager doesn't

2869.079 --> 2878.7090000000003
really rebel then they kind of become

2872.529 --> 2881.65
slaves they become slavish types and in

2878.709 --> 2886.209
a way unfortunately I was kind of like

2881.65 --> 2889.42
that but it's because I don't know my

2886.209 --> 2891.759
parents were so liberal and you know

2889.42 --> 2894.099
there was nothing to rebel against

2891.759 --> 2899.65
except that they were too liberal with

2894.099 --> 2901.8900000000003
yeah I didn't even understand that felt

2899.65 --> 2901.89
it

2907.49 --> 2914.0899999999997
and I know they were trying to do the

2909.65 --> 2916.84
right thing but they were yeah lost in a

2914.09 --> 2916.84
lot as well

2954.22 --> 2958.9599999999996
spellchecker always types Ichabod

2979.609 --> 2985.729
yeah Missouri bear stop please he's not

2982.849 --> 2987.9100000000003

3034.63 --> 3045.62
hmm I don't know who a Chabad is that I

3042.65 --> 3050.2400000000002
did hear the name it's probably not a

3045.62 --> 3053.23
very nice character but I can recall

3050.24 --> 3053.2299999999996
that story

3080.24 --> 3084.9399999999996
okay nobody's gonna say anything I'll

3083.069 --> 3088.949

3094.28 --> 3098.26

3113.03 --> 3116.8900000000003
where is the glory and that's weird

3123.36 --> 3128.9100000000003
that's pretty bizarre like why would you

3125.82 --> 3133.38
be called that by your parents in that

3128.91 --> 3140.79
language is that like why would you call

3133.38 --> 3142.94
your your kid no glory the [ __ ] and get

3140.79 --> 3142.94
it

3164.52 --> 3167.39

3233.19 --> 3240.44
Halloween story really

3244.36 --> 3254.26

3249.33 --> 3257.11
immediately a Hebrew and it's apparently

3254.26 --> 3261.2200000000003
mentioned in the book of Samuel I don't

3257.11 --> 3264.7200000000003
even know which one that is so I think

3261.22 --> 3264.72
there is a nick about there

3293.93 --> 3301.39
[Music]

3298.39 --> 3301.39

3355.14 --> 3366.94

3360.1 --> 3371.31
not a yeah he's not a sodomite promoter

3366.94 --> 3371.31

3399.21 --> 3402.46

3413.53 --> 3426.07

3426.07 --> 3435.1200000000003
would you say that why would you put

3428.17 --> 3435.12
yourself among that group I don't

3468.5 --> 3475.01
the wrong thing well maybe he just

3471.89 --> 3478.69
doesn't want to be you know since he is

3475.01 --> 3483.1400000000003
in Germany I think it's not the same

3478.69 --> 3489.55
he's not surrounded by fervent Christian

3483.14 --> 3489.5499999999997
gun-wielding Americans okay doesn't work

3494.619 --> 3500.1800000000003
if you start shouting that stuff like

3497.96 --> 3504.7400000000002
Owen Benjamin level here on the streets

3500.18 --> 3508.6699999999996
you're gonna get in real trouble it's

3504.74 --> 3511.43
just a fact so don't try to force that

3508.67 --> 3516.16
out of people's mouths if they don't

3511.43 --> 3516.16
want that just don't

3519.69 --> 3523.69

3555.66 --> 3562.0499999999997
the weather you had pretty bad weather I

3558.96 --> 3564.92
heard I hope it said it's kind of

3562.05 --> 3564.92
turning around Oh

3568.16 --> 3572.089
Norwegian way up north right

3577.93 --> 3592.069
yeah it's still something that's not

3585.7 --> 3594.8489999999997
like I don't know how strict there is

3592.069 --> 3599.259
any rules about expression over there

3594.849 --> 3599.259
about saying these types of things I

3599.619 --> 3605.329
think I'm pretty sure that it's over

3602.749 --> 3609.3489999999997
here as well it's just that I don't care

3605.329 --> 3611.299
I don't like to prod people like a

3609.349 --> 3613.19
savonia all day long and say like

3611.299 --> 3615.349
everything that's wrong just to be

3613.19 --> 3618.7290000000003
outrageous and there's plenty of Dutch

3615.349 --> 3622.549
people doing that it's absurdly annoying

3618.729 --> 3628.279
so I try not to do that but at the same

3622.549 --> 3632.18
time I am NOT gonna adapt absolutely not

3628.279 --> 3638.569
I will Express exactly what I feel when

3632.18 --> 3640.279
I feel it and justify it and I have my

3638.569 --> 3645.2
opinions and I will stick to those

3640.279 --> 3649.069
opinions at the same time I'm also gonna

3645.2 --> 3651.529
be realistic and eventually it comes

3649.069 --> 3655.3089999999997
down to yeah people make mistakes a lot

3651.529 --> 3657.589
of them sometimes they double down very

3655.309 --> 3659.1800000000003
badly and eventually they will pay the

3657.589 --> 3661.7889999999998
price it's not something that has to be

3659.18 --> 3666.519
done to them by an outsider it will

3661.789 --> 3670.0890000000004
happen to them from the inside and

3666.519 --> 3670.089
that's how I see it

3677.29 --> 3682.38
[Music]

3679.32 --> 3685.53
yeah and when you make up when you make

3682.38 --> 3689.2200000000003
a mistake you don't see the mistake and

3685.53 --> 3692.67
you double down on the mistake then

3689.22 --> 3696.5099999999998
eventually the mistake becomes you and

3692.67 --> 3699.38
then you become the mistake and when it

3696.51 --> 3702.9300000000003
gets that bad yeah then eventually

3699.38 --> 3707.85
something might have to be done about it

3702.93 --> 3713.85
if things get bad enough but yeah when

3707.85 --> 3717.0299999999997
somebody risks getting close to that

3713.85 --> 3719.31
type of way of doing things there's

3717.03 --> 3721.71
really nothing you can do but just tell

3719.31 --> 3724.98
them like this is not gonna be good for

3721.71 --> 3728.88
you and try to compare show them what's

3724.98 --> 3730.56
probably gonna happen relating it with

3728.88 --> 3732.53
other experiences from other people you

3730.56 --> 3737.64
had or maybe your own experiences

3732.53 --> 3741.0800000000004
because you can't force them it's their

3737.64 --> 3741.08
mistake to make

3745.609 --> 3751.239
like if you literally try to forbid them

3751.9 --> 3759.38
even on the surface then it's they're

3756.23 --> 3762.039
just gonna double down much worse much

3759.38 --> 3762.039
much worse

3795.64 --> 3801.0899999999997
I had a cousin on the other side who

3798.07 --> 3801.09
went to the moon daddy

3843.02 --> 3846.82
yeah that's right

3844.01 --> 3850.1600000000003
facial hair it's the elephant traits I

3846.82 --> 3856.9700000000003
have to say my facial hair isn't very

3850.16 --> 3859.31
brilliant either even though yeah for me

3856.97 --> 3863.48
it's the Asian traits which by the way

3859.31 --> 3865.04
is the same effective traits there in

3863.48 --> 3867.47
Native Americans because of it

3865.04 --> 3871.49
originally the Native Americans had a

3867.47 --> 3873.7599999999998
lot of Asian in them in the Territorian

3922.98 --> 3934.01
of mountains a lot of fresh air and a

3927.06 --> 3938.46
lot of echoes and like really fresh

3934.01 --> 3941.19
spring water streams and stuff and yeah

3938.46 --> 3942.84
that's Switzerland I also hear by the

3941.19 --> 3949.83
way that they've fluoridate their water

3942.84 --> 3953.96
which is kind of a huge bummer I have no

3949.83 --> 3956.46
idea what's in their mind doing that

3953.96 --> 3957.6
well it's gonna be fluoride it's just

3956.46 --> 3960.86
stupid

3957.6 --> 3960.86
what a waste

3961.94 --> 3965.059
[Music]

3980.88 --> 3986.1800000000003
whoa that's freaky I have no idea if

3984.599 --> 3991.319
that's real or not

3986.18 --> 3994.16
but that sounds messed up unintended

3991.319 --> 3994.16
consequences

4024.069 --> 4030.829
what are you getting Missouri bear all

4030.259 --> 4032.9
right

4030.829 --> 4038.7200000000003
- you asked about you were the one

4032.9 --> 4043.7000000000003
asking about Switzerland yeah it's

4038.72 --> 4047.089
really a beautiful country in a way for

4043.7 --> 4051.14
me like the only problem is is mostly

4047.089 --> 4053.8089999999997
just german-speaking [ __ ] but otherwise

4051.14 --> 4055.6299999999997
I would have loved to like going to live

4053.809 --> 4059.3900000000003
there

4055.63 --> 4064.13
because it is an amazing amazing country

4059.39 --> 4066.3489999999997
and like yeah they still have their

4064.13 --> 4068.349
freakin Second Amendment it's it's even

4066.349 --> 4072.4990000000003
better than that it's just like a

4068.349 --> 4078.259
militia duty it's a civil duty there now

4072.499 --> 4081.279
that's you should do it and I'm like

4078.259 --> 4081.279
kind of jealous of that

4085.41 --> 4092.64
it's like yeah yeah that that's right

4088.08 --> 4095.5499999999997
the government orders you to have

4092.64 --> 4098.49
freaking grenade launchers as it were

4095.55 --> 4102.93
it's like yeah you must have them as

4098.49 --> 4117.719999999999
your civil duty to defend the now that's

4102.93 --> 4120.54
a Second Amendment by the way I don't

4117.72 --> 4123.3
know like grenade launcher but like it's

4120.54 --> 4125.58
more than just freaking hand guns they

4123.3 --> 4132.21
really make you stock up on several

4125.58 --> 4134.93
equipment I don't know what the package

4132.21 --> 4134.93
is exactly

4148.16 --> 4155.2699999999995
great but yeah personally I would think

4152.45 --> 4160.45
that would be amazing too

4155.27 --> 4163.7300000000005
for example I guess be able to work at

4160.45 --> 4166.07
like a health resort in Switzerland you

4163.73 --> 4169.929999999999
know one of those high mountainous areas

4166.07 --> 4173.8099999999995
just they're usually very beautiful and

4169.93 --> 4175.88
great air very healthy and yeah of

4173.81 --> 4179.150000000001
course I would want to go through that

4175.88 --> 4182.18
myself sometime when I get money for

4179.15 --> 4192.98
that but like that would be pretty cool

4182.18 --> 4199.280000000001
place to work just that set up I don't

4192.98 --> 4201.139999999999
know maybe I could do something but yeah

4199.28 --> 4205.099999999999
at this point it's just all very very

4201.14 --> 4208.570000000001
remote dreams I just really like yeah

4205.1 --> 4208.570000000001
like the looks of that country

4209.56 --> 4214.990000000001
I was still talking about Switzerland by

4213.73 --> 4218.41
the way

4214.99 --> 4218.41
[Music]

4223.79 --> 4226.989
[Music]

4249.87 --> 4252.59
hmm

4275.57 --> 4280.759999999999
I just said with the official native

4278.06 --> 4283.610000000001
tribes yeah but what is that now you

4280.76 --> 4286.400000000001
know I don't want to be prodding too

4283.61 --> 4289.339999999999
much into things that are literally not

4286.4 --> 4292.94
any of my business but I get this

4289.34 --> 4295.1900000000005
feeling about the whole the native tribe

4292.94 --> 4298.129999999999
situation now it's almost like it's

4295.19 --> 4299.98
become a guild like is that really a

4298.13 --> 4304.7300000000005
tribe it's more almost like a

4299.98 --> 4310.968999999999
corporation that's like managing the the

4304.73 --> 4313.339999999999
legacy right but it feels so off it's

4310.969 --> 4315.909
like is that really what the Native

4313.34 --> 4320.860000000001
American spirit and all that is about

4315.909 --> 4325.21
it's almost more like it's become just

4320.86 --> 4329.089999999999
decorations rather than the actual

4325.21 --> 4336.25
spirit of what it's supposed to be you

4329.09 --> 4347.96
know what I mean yeah but my feelings

4336.25 --> 4352.25
yeah like do any of them really even

4347.96 --> 4356.869
care or are they just they're trying to

4352.25 --> 4358.969
defend against power and and using their

4356.869 --> 4363.619
status in their native american whatever

4358.969 --> 4366.19
thing is for yeah for graveling

4363.619 --> 4366.19
basically

4376.469 --> 4383.33
Wow Nate natives are sovereign with

4379.77 --> 4386.580000000001
their own rules and laws well yeah

4383.33 --> 4389.5199999999995
that's pretty cool that that still

4386.58 --> 4393.48
exists in Canada I don't think it's like

4389.52 --> 4393.9890000000005
that in the United States it's very

4393.48 --> 4405.5
different

4393.989 --> 4405.5
I think no casinos and whatnot

4414.4 --> 4422.53
and I find it completely bizarre like

4419.61 --> 4424.87
suppose yeah it's almost like stereotype

4422.53 --> 4426.909
now that Native Americans to run casinos

4424.87 --> 4432.01
because they're allowed to do that and

4426.909 --> 4434.3099999999995
yeah but that that's almost like yeah

4432.01 --> 4436.54
all the Native Americans now all have

4434.31 --> 4439.0
the best booze

4436.54 --> 4443.38
they're like specialized in making

4439.0 --> 4448.75
alcohol or something it's like why are

4443.38 --> 4452.7390000000005
they masters of things that well

4448.75 --> 4454.929
probably contributed to the destruction

4452.739 --> 4456.839999999999
of their original culture in the first

4454.929 --> 4459.55
place

4456.84 --> 4463.08
now with alcohol that would be much more

4459.55 --> 4466.33
apparent but yeah gambling oh yes

4463.08 --> 4471.239
especially the combination alcohol and

4466.33 --> 4478.11
gambling has created all kinds of chaos

4471.239 --> 4482.29
with Native Americans and made yeah like

4478.11 --> 4486.009999999999
tried leader selling off [ __ ] through

4482.29 --> 4489.07
gambling so it's like bizarre to me that

4486.01 --> 4493.27
there are now all masters of casinos

4489.07 --> 4496.5599999999995
it's just what is this like how are they

4493.27 --> 4496.56
ok with all that ah

4506.659 --> 4509.259999999999
yeah

4514.47 --> 4521.599
[Music]

4515.559 --> 4528.169
like where are all the the spiritual

4521.599 --> 4530.689
places the the nature temples not

4528.169 --> 4532.849
talking about disgusting for disgusting

4530.689 --> 4538.309
things sacrifices or that kind of

4532.849 --> 4541.76
nonsense but just the old animist type

4538.309 --> 4544.519
things and just nature places and beauty

4541.76 --> 4547.909000000001
and peace and meditating with the

4544.519 --> 4552.229
spirits and like is that now is that

4547.909 --> 4554.239
just all ancient past now to them it's

4552.229 --> 4558.309
like the old ways nobody cares because

4554.239 --> 4558.308999999999
they're all too busy being grabbers

4562.909 --> 4571.33
they are master debauchery this okay

4567.59 --> 4571.33
start the rest ahead if you say so

4580.41 --> 4585.84
come over and overturn your culture

4583.09 --> 4585.84
within a few decades

4591.829 --> 4600.32
yeah well if if you don't have a strong

4595.489 --> 4604.339999999999
counterculture to prevent alteration

4600.32 --> 4607.219
from the outside like too much

4604.34 --> 4608.42
adaptation to the moment yeah then yeah

4607.219 --> 4610.52
of course

4608.42 --> 4612.7390000000005
groups of people are gonna get in and

4610.52 --> 4614.119000000001
just dictate to you like no everything's

4612.739 --> 4616.098999999999
going to be different we're gonna do it

4614.119 --> 4619.04
in this age like this and you got a we

4616.099 --> 4621.469
we're helping you by helping you adapt

4619.04 --> 4626.179
to what must be done yeah that's gonna

4621.469 --> 4628.67
happen then constantly until generation

4626.179 --> 4630.65
upon generation of people will be left

4628.67 --> 4633.7390000000005
that literally don't even realize that

4630.65 --> 4637.369
they had a culture that they try to hold

4633.739 --> 4639.579
on to that's right that's what's gonna

4637.369 --> 4639.579
happen

4658.55 --> 4662.96
all right

4660.92 --> 4667.16
well you know what an intended

4662.96 --> 4670.18
consequence I think that all these

4667.16 --> 4673.13
things you dis list you're naming right

4670.18 --> 4676.18
that's that's coming from somewhere it's

4673.13 --> 4680.39
not coming from them being victimized

4676.18 --> 4682.7300000000005
it's I think it is all that poverty

4680.39 --> 4687.950000000001
drugs alcoholism and fear and all that

4682.73 --> 4690.83
[ __ ] I think it is more because they

4687.95 --> 4693.29
have a fighting spirit in them that kept

4690.83 --> 4697.37
them alive and in the tribes over the

4693.29 --> 4699.62
generations the centuries ago and they

4697.37 --> 4702.98
don't have any room for it anymore so

4699.62 --> 4705.62
they're just squirting out instinctively

4702.98 --> 4709.5199999999995
all day long because they're like they

4705.62 --> 4712.3099999999995
have need to wage war to be a warrior

4709.52 --> 4714.650000000001
and they can't because that doesn't

4712.31 --> 4716.3
exist anymore you're not allowed to do

4714.65 --> 4719.23
that and you're not allowed to go into a

4716.3 --> 4722.45
blood frenzy anymore against your enemy

4719.23 --> 4724.339999999999
see well yeah what you're gonna do then

4722.45 --> 4728.15
with all that suppressed spirit you're

4724.34 --> 4730.13
gonna go on drugs you're gonna be

4728.15 --> 4733.16
getting into fights and not being able

4730.13 --> 4735.5
to hold a job you're yeah you're gonna

4733.16 --> 4737.36
feel very hopeless and out of place in a

4735.5 --> 4739.31
way that's kind of like what it was like

4737.36 --> 4742.849999999999
for me because I have a very strong

4739.31 --> 4745.280000000001
fighting spirit and the world was just

4742.85 --> 4747.910000000001
corrupted and everybody the only advice

4745.28 --> 4753.5
was I ever got is to just let it go just

4747.91 --> 4756.07
drop it just surrender that's really all

4753.5 --> 4760.82
the advice I ever got from the outside

4756.07 --> 4765.5599999999995
it's not very satisfying and like was

4760.82 --> 4767.69
very dangerous to me so yeah I'm not

4765.56 --> 4771.650000000001
surprised but it is kind of like they

4767.69 --> 4775.03
need to figure out how to get that

4771.65 --> 4780.44
purpose back they need a new tradition a

4775.03 --> 4784.4
tradition or maybe just like a heavy

4780.44 --> 4787.73
sports you know trials like obstacle

4784.4 --> 4790.599999999999
like heavy obstacle courses like a real

4787.73 --> 4793.94
trial feel where you really where yeah

4790.6 --> 4798.219
didn't the guys could blow up

4793.94 --> 4801.61
and show off because that doing that is

4798.219 --> 4804.17
fulfilling the people that have

4801.61 --> 4807.91
inherited fighter spirit in them

4804.17 --> 4813.08
I think this Native Americans should

4807.91 --> 4818.75
just get it back get back what you had

4813.08 --> 4822.32
build a new tradition that fulfills the

4818.75 --> 4822.91
purpose that is now left open that's my

4822.32 --> 4825.5599999999995
advice

4822.91 --> 4830.12
build build it back build back a

4825.56 --> 4835.820000000001
brotherhood build back trials for the

4830.12 --> 4837.89
spirit and the body you know and you

4835.82 --> 4840.29
don't have to do it all old fashioned

4837.89 --> 4842.719
style nature if you don't want to but

4840.29 --> 4846.5
get it back I think that by the way

4842.719 --> 4849.17
there's plenty of Native Americans that

4846.5 --> 4854.17
are also just into guns a lot and all

4849.17 --> 4854.17
that and that would be logical

4874.53 --> 4880.46
- few of them left no that's not it's

4878.07 --> 4880.46
not true

4881.719 --> 4889.679
no look just because the spirit was

4885.869 --> 4891.989
broken in a way don't rather the pride

4889.679 --> 4895.11
you notice you can't really break the

4891.989 --> 4897.209999999999
spirit permanently custard the spirit

4895.11 --> 4899.848999999999
will simply be reborn in a new person

4897.21 --> 4902.28
and then it may be broken again or it

4899.849 --> 4905.28
may survive you can break the spirit but

4902.28 --> 4910.11
you can break the pride you can break

4905.28 --> 4913.61
break like the spirit of the entire

4910.11 --> 4917.009999999999
tribe and like they lose their pride and

4913.61 --> 4919.23
that's yeah you can't really take that

4917.01 --> 4921.0
away unless you completely conquer it

4919.23 --> 4923.428999999999
and rebuild it up and that takes a lot

4921.0 --> 4932.61
longer than it takes for it to be taken

4923.429 --> 4934.71
away but it's not too late it's it's

4932.61 --> 4939.869
just something that has to be realized

4934.71 --> 4945.139
like among all of you just like you have

4939.869 --> 4949.98
to it's critical that you give the kids

4945.139 --> 4954.150000000001
and the teens like proper challenges not

4949.98 --> 4956.129999999999
just challenges in Word but like a real

4954.15 --> 4958.65
serious challenge it channels where you

4956.13 --> 4961.77
could for example get wounded and not be

4958.65 --> 4963.75
all little squirty about it like oh my

4961.77 --> 4968.099
god can't take it no no no they need a

4963.75 --> 4970.289
real trial that it feels real and then

4968.099 --> 4972.9890000000005
it it's really real and then it actually

4970.289 --> 4977.88
satisfies and feeds the spirit and they

4972.989 --> 4980.489
need it it's my personal pro gnosis for

4977.88 --> 4985.52
a Native Americans they just need proper

4980.489 --> 4985.5199999999995
challenge especially when they're young

4987.99 --> 4998.26
all right and and like the best thing

4992.44 --> 5001.879999999999
ever ever for the Native American

4998.26 --> 5004.77
culture would be if they literally

5001.88 --> 5008.58
exorcise everything social justice

5004.77 --> 5010.59
warrior out of everything within their

5008.58 --> 5013.89
community within every individuals

5010.59 --> 5018.24
forever as exercising a demon because it

5013.89 --> 5022.5
is the absolute worst for them ever like

5018.24 --> 5026.48
communism is is murderous for the Native

5022.5 --> 5030.09
Americans it's terrible

5026.48 --> 5035.58
did they just need to be natural and and

5030.09 --> 5041.43
maybe sensible and just get that out get

5035.58 --> 5044.84
that [ __ ] out its or if ik because I

5041.43 --> 5047.16
know there are among them as well but

5044.84 --> 5049.56
obsessed social justice warrior types

5047.16 --> 5051.15
and again it's the warrior it's the need

5049.56 --> 5052.89
for a warrior now they've become a

5051.15 --> 5054.96
mental warrior but unfortunately they

5052.89 --> 5058.740000000001
got caught up in a program making them a

5054.96 --> 5061.08
warrior on the wrong side okay that's

5058.74 --> 5063.48
what that is and then it just needs to

5061.08 --> 5066.8099999999995
be prevented at all cost because nothing

5063.48 --> 5068.78
is going to destroy the Native American

5066.81 --> 5071.1900000000005
spirit on the long run more than

5068.78 --> 5074.34
persistent social justice warrior

5071.19 --> 5076.549999999999
influence nothing is going to destroy

5074.34 --> 5083.81
the Native Americans more than that

5076.55 --> 5083.81
nothing like yeah

5100.41 --> 5107.19
now but social justice word is it's not

5104.37 --> 5111.599999999999
a misnomer it's it's an a perfect double

5107.19 --> 5114.509999999999
speak and it is communist it's a

5111.6 --> 5120.72
communist control mechanism it's a

5114.51 --> 5130.26
social program like a game you trap a

5120.72 --> 5134.490000000001
person into so it's almost like a spell

5130.26 --> 5136.67
a game you impose upon somebody you tell

5134.49 --> 5141.96
them you must do this and if they then

5136.67 --> 5145.11
believe it they make that mistake then

5141.96 --> 5147.38
it literally enters them and it becomes

5145.11 --> 5149.339999999999
like a game they can do and it

5147.38 --> 5152.28
artificially seems like they're doing

5149.34 --> 5154.89
something good when they do it and then

5152.28 --> 5158.3099999999995
their ways get real routed into that

5154.89 --> 5161.240000000001
thought and the natural aspects their

5158.31 --> 5163.7300000000005
person gets shaved on off bit by bit

5161.24 --> 5167.5199999999995
until there's nothing left but that

5163.73 --> 5170.25
structure and what then drives the

5167.52 --> 5174.42
person will be the lust for power and

5170.25 --> 5180.0
control instead of natural impulses and

5174.42 --> 5183.59
that's exactly what that does the social

5180.0 --> 5183.59
justice warrior teachings

5193.25 --> 5196.35
[Music]

5202.33 --> 5208.43
[Music]

5209.519 --> 5218.400000000001
yeah so yeah that that's why I am that

5214.38 --> 5219.900000000001
outspoken it's like I don't hate on a

5218.4 --> 5224.61
lot of things you might have noticed

5219.9 --> 5227.07
like almost surreal how little I do but

5224.61 --> 5231.389
there are some things out there that I'm

5227.07 --> 5233.909
just basically declaring war on for real

5231.389 --> 5236.099
and yeah

5233.909 --> 5240.989
the social justice warrior mindset is

5236.099 --> 5244.289
one of them it is it is like Sauron to

5240.989 --> 5246.69
me it is just it's absolute evil it's a

5244.289 --> 5249.059
robot mechanism it's a robot program

5246.69 --> 5253.009999999999
that dehumanize is the person and then

5249.059 --> 5255.539
makes them perpetuate that

5253.01 --> 5258.269
dehumanization within themselves like a

5255.539 --> 5259.768999999999
chant they just tell you know this is

5258.269 --> 5263.88
important this is important they

5259.769 --> 5267.749
indoctrinate themselves with what now is

5263.88 --> 5270.809
important instead of letting it ride

5267.749 --> 5273.21
through their instinct and then they

5270.809 --> 5275.88
yeah they program themselves to follow

5273.21 --> 5278.01
this game the r8 games of the rules of

5275.88 --> 5284.07
the game and then they become that game

5278.01 --> 5290.55
and they lose all sense abilities they

5284.07 --> 5293.549999999999
literally destroy their own senses at

5290.55 --> 5296.039
first it's turned off then it stops

5293.55 --> 5299.599
developing and then if it persists long

5296.039 --> 5304.559
enough those senses may actually be

5299.599 --> 5307.9800000000005
destroyed don't know if people realize

5304.559 --> 5310.59
how real that is it's not just like

5307.98 --> 5317.629999999999
they're choosing not to do it no those

5310.59 --> 5317.63
senses are destroyed understand

5317.809 --> 5327.2300000000005
destroyed almost like as if they were

5321.11 --> 5327.23
cut off like with lobotomy that's real

5328.91 --> 5334.5199999999995
and it's extremely rare you get it back

5341.57 --> 5344.57
yeah

5359.579 --> 5365.67
yeah and the same by the way goes for

5363.079 --> 5370.7699999999995
teaching yourself to ignore your

5365.67 --> 5372.329
conscience that also burns it out and by

5370.77 --> 5374.400000000001
the way in a way that's kind of what the

5372.329 --> 5376.829
social justice warrior mechanism does

5374.4 --> 5378.719
but it doesn't do it in a direct way it

5376.829 --> 5381.329
doesn't literally make you extinguish

5378.719 --> 5383.67
your own conscience note it falsely

5381.329 --> 5387.36
overlays another program and then

5383.67 --> 5390.079
suggest this is a better conscience than

5387.36 --> 5394.23
your actual natural-born conscience and

5390.079 --> 5397.699
they try to reroute it and then that

5394.23 --> 5401.699
effectively outside of your con

5397.699 --> 5404.579
consensus knowledge just destroys part

5401.699 --> 5407.638999999999
of your instinct that you can no longer

5404.579 --> 5411.53
even find those impulses no longer reach

5407.639 --> 5411.53
you you forget that that exists

5423.05 --> 5429.35
like for example virtues people can be

5426.05 --> 5432.29
made to forget the value of virtues real

5429.35 --> 5435.200000000001
virtues like common things not just

5432.29 --> 5436.91
doing on showing off like oh I am so

5435.2 --> 5439.25
liberal blah blah blah or whatever I'm

5436.91 --> 5443.62
so with the day on camera for my company

5439.25 --> 5447.68
but not that virtue actual virtue just

5443.62 --> 5449.99
being a person going around seeing

5447.68 --> 5454.01
something happening and then responding

5449.99 --> 5457.099999999999
properly it can be very little things it

5454.01 --> 5459.02
can be bigger things that's normal

5457.1 --> 5466.52
that's a virtue and virtuous behavior

5459.02 --> 5473.84
and it's kind of been programmed out

5466.52 --> 5475.55
it's like virtue is being shamed do you

5473.84 --> 5478.79
see it as part of the social justice

5475.55 --> 5487.1900000000005
warrior deprogramming virtue is being

5478.79 --> 5490.39
shamed and shameless behavior is being

5487.19 --> 5495.46
promoted saying it's liberating

5490.39 --> 5495.46
it's a liberating from the conscious

5496.09 --> 5501.56
like you don't have to feel guilty for

5498.83 --> 5503.75
this anymore it's ok now you can do this

5501.56 --> 5508.400000000001
it's no longer immoral because we say

5503.75 --> 5511.52
it's not and at the same time what's

5508.4 --> 5513.589999999999
that natural impulse what this kid does

5511.52 --> 5516.410000000001
that and it feels really good about it

5513.59 --> 5519.9800000000005
afterward that's not allowed you can't

5516.41 --> 5522.889999999999
do that you can't act like a man or

5519.98 --> 5526.58
something you can't open that door for

5522.89 --> 5528.8
that woman how dare you that's like are

5526.58 --> 5532.55
they are you saying they're too weak to

5528.8 --> 5534.92
open it up themselves no no no that's

5532.55 --> 5537.9800000000005
just a virtue it's just a normal

5534.92 --> 5542.6
behavior that is part of our instincts

5537.98 --> 5545.509999999999
too everybody thrives on that but no

5542.6 --> 5549.200000000001
they want that all away take away the

5545.51 --> 5554.14
virtues and shame them then they give

5549.2 --> 5556.88
you suggestions of terrible behavior or

5554.14 --> 5559.34
just immoral things and

5556.88 --> 5563.87
then say it's okay now it's okay now to

5559.34 --> 5568.07
do this it's no longer immoral because

5563.87 --> 5571.219
we say it isn't just don't think about

5568.07 --> 5574.94
it you can do it now it's okay it's okay

5571.219 --> 5578.719
just let yourself go that's what they're

5574.94 --> 5584.199
doing it's been doing they've been doing

5578.719 --> 5588.53
that for a long time and I absolutely

5584.199 --> 5592.25
despise it every time I see that happen

5588.53 --> 5595.82
like that I get these impulses of like

5592.25 --> 5600.77
extreme violent outbursts that are just

5595.82 --> 5602.989
waiting like to basically jump on them

5600.77 --> 5604.280000000001
and then start bashing like right as

5602.989 --> 5606.62
they're just talking on the microphone

5604.28 --> 5609.159
what it just I know it's ridiculous they

5606.62 --> 5614.2699999999995
would never do that it's it's like ape

5609.159 --> 5617.54
instinct violence almost but that I have

5614.27 --> 5621.320000000001
that instinctive response that is

5617.54 --> 5624.17
actually natural I shouldn't do it

5621.32 --> 5626.84
it's not productive but that I have that

5624.17 --> 5630.679
response is actually a sign like yes it

5626.84 --> 5633.469
really is that [ __ ] up and people

5630.679 --> 5638.06
don't even see it they don't even see

5633.469 --> 5641.42
what's happening I see it though I feel

5638.06 --> 5643.63
it makes me very pissed off when I see

5641.42 --> 5643.63
that

5676.34 --> 5682.52
now Elin didn't say it's fake it just oh

5679.7 --> 5691.19
wait are you talking about Corona you

5682.52 --> 5694.55
know he did kind of say that yeah well

5691.19 --> 5699.61
Elon did say he didn't say it was fake

5694.55 --> 5703.75
his car he just said it looked fake

5699.61 --> 5703.75
that's effectively what he said

5723.849 --> 5730.09
all right anyway yeah my show has been

5727.189 --> 5730.09
all over the place today

5733.269 --> 5742.579000000001
Native Americans social justice warrior

5738.699 --> 5744.888999999999
programming and how that all works what

5742.579 --> 5748.518999999999
it does to you and why I freaking hate

5744.889 --> 5751.429
it so much because I don't do it because

5748.519 --> 5753.579000000001
I just have this random allergy that

5751.429 --> 5758.78
every time I hear it I just get really

5753.579 --> 5761.949
outraged no it's a genuinely despise it

5758.78 --> 5766.15
I see it as absolute concentrated evil

5761.949 --> 5769.638999999999
it's one of the most evil things and

5766.15 --> 5775.03
people don't even realize it that's the

5769.639 --> 5778.82
problem all right
