169.73 --> 176.81
watch back yesterday and I don't know I

174.2 --> 183.01899999999998
didn't like my show too much let's just

176.81 --> 185.33
do too messy hmm I don't know I wasn't

183.019 --> 188.209
that my mind was just not that orderly

185.33 --> 192.68
yesterday in contrast to the days before

188.209 --> 194.51
that I don't know why maybe it's because

192.68 --> 198.11
of this yeah there's some miserable

194.51 --> 200.35
weather it does tend to distract me a

198.11 --> 200.35000000000002
lot

203.81 --> 213.62
okay hello stallion 8012

207.92 --> 217.31
yeah I appreciate the apology yeah it's

213.62 --> 235.34
the timing was just bad but okay that's

217.31 --> 237.83
that's fine right oh dammit I completely

235.34 --> 240.26
forgot to make notes I don't know why oh

237.83 --> 244.489
wait I do know why because it was

240.26 --> 246.29
Wednesday and it was too distracted like

244.489 --> 249.04
I was really not looking forward to

246.29 --> 251.959
doing my newspaper round but first

249.04 --> 255.41
somehow I managed to keep it completely

251.959 --> 261.13
dry during that thing which was during

255.41 --> 263.75
the Flat Earth debates after show and

261.13 --> 266.27
afterwards yeah I had a lot of fun after

263.75 --> 271.19
the recording was over with chocolate

266.27 --> 274.88
and Brian typical that we hang around in

271.19 --> 277.46
the after chat in the after panel but

274.88 --> 281.93
yeah like I didn't know chocolate

277.46 --> 285.15999999999997
actually did a rap that he made it was

281.93 --> 288.08
really freaky good it's like what bros

285.16 --> 290.75
since when are you doing rap but it was

288.08 --> 293.539
like he made that I was really inspired

290.75 --> 295.07
and was really awesome I don't know if I

293.539 --> 297.56
even should be telling this to everybody

295.07 --> 302.99
you I don't know it'll probably leak out

297.56 --> 310.19
I'm not gonna it's his work but it was

302.99 --> 315.83
just really awesome after that one

310.19 --> 319.58
Benjamin oh yeah D livestream is really

315.83 --> 322.19
giving me a hard time like it's so

319.58 --> 324.59
annoying when it just starts to lag

322.19 --> 327.02
right in the middle of a joke and all

324.59 --> 329.06
that you know and then soon yeah I have

327.02 --> 331.96999999999997
to reload and when it reloads it's over

329.06 --> 332.669
it and that's been happening like six to

331.97 --> 335.96900000000005
ten

332.669 --> 337.94899999999996
in the stream it's it's kind of

335.969 --> 340.56
aggravating but it's not opens fall of

337.949 --> 348.09000000000003
course steel life I don't know why does

340.56 --> 352.25
that uh was it again

348.09 --> 354.539
oh yeah the the the mask responses right

352.25 --> 359.58
those were some funny videos

354.539 --> 363.08
I still remember that one because he

359.58 --> 367.81899999999996
played it like four times or something

363.08 --> 367.81899999999996
so I've definitely seen that completely

373.18 --> 389.22
let's see after that didn't it I go to

384.25 --> 389.22
bed like around 1 o'clock I think

392.96 --> 399.59
they're reading up on some more Dutch

394.97 --> 401.41900000000004
news it's just like yeah the farmers you

399.59 --> 402.85999999999996
know the pharmacy in the Netherlands

401.419 --> 407.35999999999996
they're they're really getting a

402.86 --> 410.03000000000003
whooping and it's just bad it's not good

407.36 --> 414.5
and there's other words there's just

410.03 --> 417.44
this conspiracy basically revealing

414.5 --> 420.5
itself in many ways and it's like

417.44 --> 422.18
gripping in almost every political party

420.5 --> 425.36
too and you know and people have known

422.18 --> 429.669
that for a while sort of indirectly that

425.36 --> 433.19
there's like this group playing around

429.669 --> 437.44899999999996
but now it's getting really up front

433.19 --> 439.52
like it's just getting very blatant so

437.449 --> 443.15000000000003
apparently they're yeah one of the ways

439.52 --> 446.83
these things are revealed is that in one

443.15 --> 453.71
of the political parties the Christian

446.83 --> 456.68
part what is CDA yeah the Christian

453.71 --> 459.919
Democratic appeal basically translated

456.68 --> 463.81
and yeah it's supposedly the prim the

459.919 --> 466.82
main Christian party sort of but it's

463.81 --> 468.59
it's already a bit dubious like I've had

466.82 --> 471.229
issues with that party for a long time

468.59 --> 475.52
like they don't seem very Christian a

471.229 --> 478.13
lot of the times but yeah there's this

475.52 --> 480.74
guy in there I don't even know you know

478.13 --> 484.909
I I don't look into this [ __ ] it just

480.74 --> 490.52
popped up in oh sweet there was a this

484.909 --> 491.84
dude a board vote like who was going to

490.52 --> 495.08
be in control of the board

491.84 --> 496.58
and yeah this one guy who see I've been

495.08 --> 499.039
looking at a photo of him he looks like

496.58 --> 501.5
a really awesome guy like he's really

499.039 --> 504.59
shining I don't know who he is you know

501.5 --> 506.81
but they apparently said no no no we

504.59 --> 510.77
have to redo this because there were

506.81 --> 515.36
like the the votes are wrong because

510.77 --> 516.86
this guy was basically on top of it so

515.36 --> 519.5600000000001
they're gonna redo the vote because he

516.86 --> 523.4590000000001
wasn't supposed to win and yeah that's

519.56 --> 524.9799999999999
now how the Netherlands apparently does

523.459 --> 527.4799999999999
things here it is

524.98 --> 531.37
just makes me want to throw up that kind

527.48 --> 534.6800000000001
of situation it's just so corrupt look

531.37 --> 536.45
and I don't even care you know really

534.68 --> 538.5799999999999
because I don't know this guy might be

536.45 --> 540.47
just completely apologetic about it or

538.58 --> 543.44
he might get really pissed off with the

540.47 --> 549.08
party I don't know Dutch politics it's

543.44 --> 553.4000000000001
like it's bad but that's it going on I'm

549.08 --> 559.34
I think there's just a lot of heating up

553.4 --> 562.04
going on here so I'm gonna try to look

559.34 --> 567.1700000000001
into it a little more source a little

562.04 --> 570.4399999999999
better but it's tough on me because I've

567.17 --> 572.93
been avoiding Dutch news for my entire

570.44 --> 574.97
well known for twenty years like pretty

572.93 --> 581.8599999999999
much after Alex Jones I really started

574.97 --> 581.86
avoiding it because it's just terrible

589.0 --> 596.649
so anyway you're looking into that debts

591.98 --> 596.649
yeah that was movies

609.91 --> 620.41
watch oh hey Thank You Alan beard for

616.3 --> 626.8199999999999
the 172 pounds super shadow nation much

620.41 --> 626.8199999999999
appreciated welcome to the stream

635.78 --> 648.26
yeah Missouri berry you told us

637.79 --> 650.81
yesterday pretty ridiculous yet the

648.26 --> 653.36
whole mask situation like in the in the

650.81 --> 655.8499999999999
United States it's really bad like in

653.36 --> 657.62
the Netherlands it's barely there and I

655.85 --> 661.85
think that I don't know about for

657.62 --> 664.55
example Germany or England I'm not too

661.85 --> 667.0400000000001
sure I'd have to hear from you how it's

664.55 --> 669.7099999999999
going there but over here this is just

667.04 --> 676.13
there's barely people wearing masks

669.71 --> 678.2
anyway now that's the last of my Google

676.13 --> 681.71
valence meager pickings all right well

678.2 --> 687.6800000000001
thank you appreciate it that you thought

681.71 --> 691.8100000000001
I was worth yeah donating to my

687.68 --> 691.81
Airstream Thank You Ellen burn

700.51 --> 708.1
all right yeah and what do you guys

704.05 --> 710.65
think like this is through Infowars and

708.1 --> 712.65
such which is still followed just yeah

710.65 --> 715.0
just keep tabs

712.65 --> 718.12
apparently now the whole Kanye West's

715.0 --> 721.09
like he's getting easily making a move

718.12 --> 723.22
and he's suggesting that he might become

721.09 --> 728.61
president and like what do you guys

723.22 --> 731.74
think of that in all seriousness like I

728.61 --> 733.78
don't know I I'm I'm I'm trying to

731.74 --> 738.13
picture in my mind like what would that

733.78 --> 744.67
be like would it be just me more of the

738.13 --> 747.43
same would it just be this guy basically

744.67 --> 749.14
just like Trump being put in place and

747.43 --> 751.3299999999999
maybe surrounded by a couple of good

749.14 --> 753.0699999999999
people and if things could go wrong and

751.33 --> 760.96
then suddenly it's the same [ __ ] over

753.07 --> 763.09
again idiot okey dokey well that

760.96 --> 766.36
certainly does make him a good candidate

763.09 --> 769.09
then oh thank you by the way good

766.36 --> 771.75
servant for the one dollar 73 super

769.09 --> 771.75
chair donation

773.5 --> 776.71
[Music]

781.78 --> 787.769
[Music]

784.189 --> 790.86
right yeah and yeah guys by the way I

787.769 --> 797.339
don't I know there is a lot of stuff

790.86 --> 799.259
happening in flat earth land more people

797.339 --> 803.5790000000001
going at it and with the ballers and

799.259 --> 807.259
even like for example Spurs chemos has

803.579 --> 813.8889999999999
really gone at it with that PhD guy and

807.259 --> 819.029
I don't know I'm I'm being kind of like

813.889 --> 821.61
we say resistant a little oh well thank

819.029 --> 825.629
you Tom Parker for the $5 super jetta

821.61 --> 833.6990000000001
nation thanks for all your hard work

825.629 --> 835.589
well the hard work come on is what I do

833.699 --> 838.3499999999999
what try to do my best but I'm not

835.589 --> 843.6890000000001
really that much of a hard worker to be

838.35 --> 846.4490000000001
fair it makes me nervous when I think

843.689 --> 853.139
about it in the face of God you know

846.449 --> 855.24
because yeah you know I'm certainly

853.139 --> 859.23
trying to work on it's just that my

855.24 --> 861.269
system is not very it's just one of my

859.23 --> 866.61
problems it's one of my general life

861.269 --> 869.009
challenges at least I see it as one it's

866.61 --> 874.069
already one step further than most

869.009 --> 874.069
people that have the same problem

878.47 --> 883.9300000000001
oh yeah Kanye is playing the god card

881.56 --> 886.3599999999999
which plays into the Bible Belt

883.93 --> 890.65
Americans yes he is that's absolutely a

886.36 --> 894.73
strategy but he is really playing into

890.65 --> 897.31
the yeah I don't even want to call it

894.73 --> 902.6800000000001
that but it he is playing like into the

897.31 --> 905.68
the [ __ ] Christian the the Christian

902.68 --> 908.3199999999999
cattle not saying that all Christians

905.68 --> 910.9
are cattle absolutely not of course I

908.32 --> 914.1
myself call myself a Christian and I

910.9 --> 916.42
explain it it's just that because of the

914.1 --> 919.57
standardization of Christian churches

916.42 --> 921.88
and the way things go about and tax

919.57 --> 925.87
situation yeah that's a lot of people

921.88 --> 930.37
just turn into that in America it just

925.87 --> 934.8100000000001
happens and yeah he is playing into that

930.37 --> 939.43
and that seems like I don't know wrong

934.81 --> 942.3399999999999
or off to I guess people like us and

939.43 --> 946.63
he's also like a space fan and all that

942.34 --> 949.39
you know like big bodies Elon Musk and

946.63 --> 951.79
Alex Jones and you can already see Alex

949.39 --> 954.22
Jones just having this vision oh man he

951.79 --> 960.9599999999999
could finally make it like serious

954.22 --> 960.96
that's part of this thing you know so

961.29 --> 964.29
yeah

968.93 --> 974.6289999999999
although yeah I'm not I'm not gonna say

971.569 --> 979.009
that the guy is like evil but he

974.629 --> 983.54
certainly does have some he is off in

979.009 --> 987.019
certain ways but I think that deep

983.54 --> 989.529
inside he really is doing his best to do

987.019 --> 991.91
things right but he's just in

989.529 --> 995.8389999999999
compromising you know that's that's the

991.91 --> 998.8689999999999
habit game and there's only so many

995.839 --> 1002.74
compromises you can make before you get

998.869 --> 1006.9390000000001
dragged down and basically transform

1002.74 --> 1015.73
into a grappler so there's that risk

1006.939 --> 1017.92
still the thing about it Connie is a

1015.73 --> 1018.309
lots about entertainment right well nak

1017.92 --> 1021.16
sir

1018.309 --> 1025.75
you know hey remember Ronald Reagan he's

1021.16 --> 1028.4189999999999
an actor so you gotta realize to you

1025.75 --> 1034.48
know what is a president what are they

1028.419 --> 1037.24
supposed to do you could almost say that

1034.48 --> 1039.52
in that sense Kanye West is an ideal

1037.24 --> 1041.559
candidate for being president because he

1039.52 --> 1044.589
is the kind of an actor entertainer and

1041.559 --> 1046.449
a good guy he's trying to be and he is

1044.589 --> 1051.309
compromising somewhat to kind of

1046.449 --> 1055.5700000000002
financially blah blah blah so oh right

1051.309 --> 1058.33
Tom Parker ah I completely forgot

1055.57 --> 1060.73
I did have the window open but it

1058.33 --> 1066.6689999999999
completely slipped me by sorry Tom

1060.73 --> 1068.38
Parker I should have watched it I did

1066.669 --> 1071.49
check out his channel for a bit but it

1068.38 --> 1071.49
didn't really watch the video

1071.7 --> 1078.3990000000001
so really yeah Gideon's like yeah you

1074.26 --> 1080.289
can call it puppet no problem it's just

1078.399 --> 1083.1399999999999
that the function of the president is

1080.289 --> 1087.19
been kind of mythologized into this

1083.14 --> 1090.5490000000002
emperor position that is like kingly

1087.19 --> 1095.3200000000002
control when that's like not the case at

1090.549 --> 1099.34
all but this image and the and the flare

1095.32 --> 1101.35
about it and it's just being so put out

1099.34 --> 1102.55
there that that is what people believe

1101.35 --> 1110.4099999999999
instead of the

1102.55 --> 1113.59
chill function really and yeah by that

1110.41 --> 1124.1200000000001
standard I think that Kanye West would

1113.59 --> 1127.9499999999998
be a fine president I guess certainly be

1124.12 --> 1127.9499999999998
yeah better than Obama

1131.55 --> 1136.4099999999999
Jesus is not about Flair yeah that's

1134.14 --> 1136.41
true

1142.96 --> 1149.88
right but it's as long as he's not gonna

1145.63 --> 1155.0500000000002
push the moral boundaries like within

1149.88 --> 1158.3200000000002
his situation any further then I don't

1155.05 --> 1161.9199999999998
know then yeah it's not perfect

1158.32 --> 1165.22
definitely but it could be okay yeah I

1161.92 --> 1171.8700000000001
don't know Who am I to judge this you

1165.22 --> 1175.3500000000001
know I'm not even American so just just

1171.87 --> 1175.35
presupposing basically

1180.9 --> 1195.0900000000001
if you believe the American politics is

1183.48 --> 1198.95
real well not really not in the way they

1195.09 --> 1198.9499999999998
want you to believe it is real anyway

1211.51 --> 1218.02
hmm okay a man like me that's an

1214.18 --> 1220.9
interesting perspective thank you for

1218.02 --> 1227.8
actually thinking along you may have a

1220.9 --> 1230.44
good point let's just say that if little

1227.8 --> 1232.6
old me would ever really go to a

1230.44 --> 1234.8200000000002
position like that I would first try to

1232.6 --> 1237.4299999999998
like just manage the city first as well

1234.82 --> 1240.33
just you know you can't just from

1237.43 --> 1243.55
nowhere just become president like that

1240.33 --> 1246.31
or or you just won't have a good grip on

1243.55 --> 1249.82
the situation you wouldn't know like how

1246.31 --> 1254.26
the weight of things really are then you

1249.82 --> 1259.35
have to first test it in my opinion

1254.26 --> 1259.35
that's how I will do it right

1265.68 --> 1271.5800000000002
Oh Cleary don't call me sire

1271.73 --> 1278.3
I'm not a lord the governor of Alaska

1282.11 --> 1295.56
well I don't know this kind of remote

1289.35 --> 1300.24
isn't it and cold yeah it's easy but

1295.56 --> 1308.79
what is he gonna do I don't know I'll

1300.24 --> 1314.85
leave it up to you guys right Robin

1308.79 --> 1321.33
Stanley kanya left California and he did

1314.85 --> 1324.6599999999999
not stay to use his influence I think

1321.33 --> 1327.12
that probably facing yeah all the other

1324.66 --> 1329.8500000000001
media influence that is there he just

1327.12 --> 1331.53
thought that he would not be able to and

1329.85 --> 1336.0
it would be an endless war

1331.53 --> 1337.74
I don't know I'm I'm divining things now

1336.0 --> 1347.64
very superficially I don't even know too

1337.74 --> 1350.07
much about it but yeah I don't know you

1347.64 --> 1352.88
know I definitely know that Kenya is not

1350.07 --> 1352.8799999999999
a perfect guy

1367.25 --> 1369.97
hmm

1376.08 --> 1382.07
he not an ordinary man what do you mean

1392.39 --> 1402.5300000000002
arts and crafts although yeah he does

1395.45 --> 1407.56
dabble into that [ __ ] that's true he's

1402.53 --> 1407.56
like very into the occult

1429.93 --> 1437.5700000000002
he's a freak really I'll stay out of it

1438.12 --> 1444.29
I don't know man I don't know how far

1440.85 --> 1444.29
he's gone I'd just

1451.65 --> 1457.71
they just can't get the fish sticks joke

1454.65 --> 1467.19
yet oh that's a good one Thank You

1457.71 --> 1470.299
Matthew Mitchell that's really yeah yeah

1467.19 --> 1470.299
that's from South Park

1473.58 --> 1476.6699999999998
[Music]

1480.71 --> 1492.049
what is perverse good servant talking

1485.33 --> 1496.12
about a gay fish why did this it's a

1492.049 --> 1496.12
joke oh come on

1507.57 --> 1533.4099999999999
all right I thought the fish sticks

1518.35 --> 1536.7099999999998
episode was hilarious yeah and you know

1533.41 --> 1542.02
in a way the funny thing is in that

1536.71 --> 1545.83
episode yeah he's not a bad guy like

1542.02 --> 1548.86
he's not a a scumbag or anything in that

1545.83 --> 1551.74
right he's just kind of like a a bit

1548.86 --> 1553.4499999999998
deluded and a bit like naive that's how

1551.74 --> 1557.98
they portray them in that episode that's

1553.45 --> 1560.29
not nefarious so yeah I thought it was

1557.98 --> 1564.64
like pretty special and it probably has

1560.29 --> 1566.56
helped him become more known via the

1564.64 --> 1570.13
South Park episode because it wasn't in

1566.56 --> 1572.49
an evil way it was just joking around

1570.13 --> 1572.49
with him

1584.45 --> 1588.0800000000002
afghani I wanted to be politically

1586.79 --> 1591.58
influenced he would have been better

1588.08 --> 1594.8
staying with the Kardashians Oh God

1591.58 --> 1597.11
yeah but you'd have the problem is

1594.8 --> 1601.45
Michael work you would have to stay with

1597.11 --> 1601.4499999999998

right what a man like me look if there

1652.32 --> 1658.23
wasn't any truth in the joke then it

1654.9 --> 1660.48
wouldn't be as funny it's funny because

1658.23 --> 1663.9
it's like ooh ooh that's kind of true

1660.48 --> 1666.06
and that kind of makes yeah that makes

1663.9 --> 1667.5300000000002
it like really funny and it's like oh is

1666.06 --> 1670.71
he going to be pissed off is it going to

1667.53 --> 1674.07
be pissed off yeah that's because it's

1670.71 --> 1677.1200000000001
there is some truth in it that's what

1674.07 --> 1677.12
makes it funny that's right

[Music]

1683.9 --> 1689.48

1744.97 --> 1753.14
right

1747.62 --> 1755.5
yes a man like me I remember that also

1753.14 --> 1758.39
the right of Kings is basically

1755.5 --> 1761.48
originally I think it might be slightly

1758.39 --> 1764.0900000000001
off I haven't bright this is basically

1761.48 --> 1765.8600000000001
coming out of my sleeve it's been dusty

1764.09 --> 1768.9499999999998
for a long time but I think the right of

1765.86 --> 1773.9599999999998
Kings is basically that you're saying

1768.95 --> 1781.3700000000001
yeah I am being appointed by God to

1773.96 --> 1783.44
perform the duty which would be for

1781.37 --> 1787.9899999999998
Christian Kings at least in the name of

1783.44 --> 1787.99
Christ the King of Kings

1794.79 --> 1797.94
[Music]

1798.08 --> 1809.75
Jesus is the Sun that's probably how the

1805.65 --> 1809.75
pagans would do it I think

1829.01 --> 1833.48
that what does that mean Gillian sick

1831.05 --> 1837.37
when you have no self-image or self

1833.48 --> 1837.3700000000001
serving you are Lord what

1857.38 --> 1863.8100000000002
hmm yeah George Sanford I know all

1861.32 --> 1867.79
religious tell the same story because

1863.81 --> 1871.6399999999999
all the religions have been visited and

1867.79 --> 1875.6
touched by Jesuits that went around the

1871.64 --> 1878.15
world I think that they're probably the

1875.6 --> 1881.03
cause of the fast synchronization within

1878.15 --> 1884.5300000000002
the stories like there were probably

1881.03 --> 1890.81
other versions as well and then those

1884.53 --> 1892.55
were basically removed and then this is

1890.81 --> 1899.27
what was left so that it does

1892.55 --> 1901.37
synchronize but that doesn't mean that

1899.27 --> 1906.47
that is the only truth that just means

1901.37 --> 1908.9899999999998
that that system is woven within it it's

1906.47 --> 1913.48
basically a cult knowledge that is made

1908.99 --> 1913.48
part of it to make it last forever you

1915.67 --> 1920.14
call it pagan roots if you like

1923.1 --> 1930.9499999999998
[Music]

1927.289 --> 1930.95
hey Denis Kang

1950.26 --> 1953.44
[Music]

1957.54 --> 1963.51
possibly their story was one story well

1961.25 --> 1967.799
yeah that's how it could have started

1963.51 --> 1970.5
out and that over the ages like yeah

1967.799 --> 1973.46
because of the the different cultures it

1970.5 --> 1978.48
just underwent transformations and

1973.46 --> 1981.6000000000001
political polarization against other

1978.48 --> 1984.6
groups because of situations and then

1981.6 --> 1986.82
yeah it just gains its its own identity

1984.6 --> 1991.32
and it's probably going to be drawn more

1986.82 --> 1995.28
towards well where that religion

1991.32 --> 2000.3799999999999
typically is upheld as the roots of all

1995.28 --> 2005.48
things that's very typical but it could

2000.38 --> 2008.0900000000001
definitely be yeah or it like bigger

2005.48 --> 2012.65
parts of the more older stories could

2008.09 --> 2015.3999999999999
definitely have come from a singular

2012.65 --> 2015.4
source perhaps

2021.12 --> 2027.87
but yeah then again was that source

2024.54 --> 2030.96
they're really all the time or was it

2027.87 --> 2040.53
edited in when the Jesuits went around

2030.96 --> 2042.93
the world see not sure I'm really not

2040.53 --> 2045.0
sure it could have been afterwards

2042.93 --> 2046.65
altered like they literally forced

2045.0 --> 2049.5
everyone you know you like they

2046.65 --> 2053.1
basically infiltrate and just force it

2049.5 --> 2053.76
to alter and because especially back in

2053.1 --> 2056.85
the days

2053.76 --> 2061.32
a lot of priesthoods were based on

2056.85 --> 2064.0499999999997
secrecy and having secret inside most

2061.32 --> 2066.36
people wouldn't even realize because

2064.05 --> 2069.21
they never got to see those books at

2066.36 --> 2072.21
that time now everything is pretty much

2069.21 --> 2075.21
put out in the open but that wasn't like

2072.21 --> 2078.14
that back then so they basically used

2075.21 --> 2080.4
the secrecy to just alter it without

2078.14 --> 2084.0299999999997
without the majority of the world even

2080.4 --> 2090.12
realizing that it had happened because

2084.03 --> 2093.42
nobody gets to see it see how that works

2090.12 --> 2093.42
[Music]

2098.74 --> 2102.2799999999997
[Music]

2131.54 --> 2134.599
[Music]

2136.23 --> 2138.89
yeah

2139.65 --> 2144.84
anyway yeah yeah what I just said I

2142.89 --> 2147.48
think that's really I don't think it

2144.84 --> 2150.15
really has an original source that was

2147.48 --> 2152.43
in those religions since the beginning I

2150.15 --> 2155.07
think it was edited I think they forced

2152.43 --> 2158.37
everyone to synchronize like okay you

2155.07 --> 2161.67
have to adapt these specific stories to

2158.37 --> 2164.31
the celestial timings system just like

2161.67 --> 2167.19
happen in the Bible like you must adapt

2164.31 --> 2168.7799999999997
your religion to this in some way and if

2167.19 --> 2176.52
they refused they would just kill them

2168.78 --> 2180.5400000000004
and that's yeah and I don't know some

2176.52 --> 2184.17
religious people keepers of that type of

2180.54 --> 2187.71
lore maybe not didn't even realize what

2184.17 --> 2190.59
was yeah the the wider importance of

2187.71 --> 2192.2
that act they just said okay fine

2190.59 --> 2194.67
whatever

2192.2 --> 2198.27
because they didn't even realize what it

2194.67 --> 2200.91
was that was being done like how that

2198.27 --> 2202.83
alteration really mattered what the

2200.91 --> 2206.46
long-term plan was they might not have

2202.83 --> 2208.62
been in the known of it and hey if they

2206.46 --> 2210.87
were yeah they probably died in that way

2208.62 --> 2213.69
like people with real oversight that

2210.87 --> 2216.9
could really make long-term predictions

2213.69 --> 2218.76
that could keep dispelling the whole set

2216.9 --> 2221.9100000000003
up like five hundred years in advance

2218.76 --> 2224.5200000000004
they killed him I'm pretty sure they did

2221.91 --> 2227.96
they were probably much more ruthless

2224.52 --> 2233.19
back then because just yeah the the

2227.96 --> 2237.26
earlier on the plan is set the more

2233.19 --> 2239.9700000000003
importance the secrecy is is like yeah

2237.26 --> 2245.9300000000003
lethally important that like nothing

2239.97 --> 2245.93
slips out at the beginning this big plan

2245.99 --> 2249.1499999999996
[Music]

2263.88 --> 2265.9100000000003
Oh

2268.56 --> 2272.91
the whole truth of being religious is to

2271.41 --> 2279.12
become one at the moment

2272.91 --> 2283.46
everything else is confusion what if if

2279.12 --> 2286.04
you mean yeah to just live your life and

2283.46 --> 2290.1
yeah I kind of be in the moment be

2286.04 --> 2292.59
yourself realize what you want make good

2290.1 --> 2295.19
decisions don't be distracted yeah then

2292.59 --> 2295.19
I agree

2314.45 --> 2321.02
what

2316.73 --> 2323.66
yeah yeah or guys if you're gonna say

2321.02 --> 2327.49
what Jesus is it's kind of dubious then

2323.66 --> 2330.77
I could say that Jesus is a method

2327.49 --> 2334.25
that's kind of like effectively the

2330.77 --> 2337.64
frequency consequence is you'd call it

2334.25 --> 2341.81
the method but yeah unless you have that

2337.64 --> 2344.15
spirit then the method not fueled by

2341.81 --> 2347.93
spirit is gonna buckle because without

2344.15 --> 2350.56
the spirit the method doesn't work you

2347.93 --> 2350.56
can't fake it

2384.06 --> 2388.37
okay Gideon's sick if you say so

2389.06 --> 2392.79
[Music]

2400.72 --> 2405.859
right look George Sanford if you're

2403.43 --> 2408.9199999999996
going to literally say he is the Sun

2405.859 --> 2410.93
then you're like threading them yeah

2408.92 --> 2412.849
strange grounds you know if you want to

2410.93 --> 2415.1299999999997
keep on references like oh Jesus

2412.849 --> 2417.4700000000003
actually represents the celestial Sun

2415.13 --> 2420.109
body that's one thing but if you're

2417.47 --> 2422.1499999999996
going to say literally he is the Sun

2420.109 --> 2423.92
well what is the Sun the Sun is an

2422.15 --> 2427.7000000000003
apparition it's not even a physical

2423.92 --> 2432.619
object it's just a side effect of

2427.7 --> 2437.72
daylight manifests oh yeah maybe don't

2432.619 --> 2445.309
do that you don't even know what the Sun

2437.72 --> 2447.74
is it's light but it's not just like

2445.309 --> 2451.329
it's a very strange type of light

2447.74 --> 2456.47
because it's a light without a direct

2451.329 --> 2459.2000000000003
pinpoint able physical source and add it

2456.47 --> 2460.1899999999996
that's a unique thing about the globe of

2459.2 --> 2463.069
the heavens all of it

2460.19 --> 2465.71
it's unique compared to terrestrial

2463.069 --> 2468.319
light which we can make several ways

2465.71 --> 2473.599
using fire or electricity or whatever

2468.319 --> 2476.0589999999997
chemistry but that light behaves very

2473.599 --> 2479.2400000000002
differently celestial light and

2476.059 --> 2481.46
terrestrial light you could devise it

2479.24 --> 2485.0589999999997
like that celestial light terrestrial

2481.46 --> 2488.9
light celestial light is technically or

2485.059 --> 2490.25
seems to be so far there's no evidence

2488.9 --> 2492.5
to the contrary it seems to be

2490.25 --> 2493.339
holographic completely unique to

2492.5 --> 2495.65
observers

2493.339 --> 2500.299
there's no pinpoint of all source so

2495.65 --> 2506.119
it's like a light manifests with a yeah

2500.299 --> 2510.549
apparent source for that light in form

2506.119 --> 2516.2200000000003
of a yeah the holographic blip a star or

2510.549 --> 2516.22
yeah a certain type of imagery traits

2517.0 --> 2522.5
that are visible at the epicenter of the

2519.619 --> 2525.4700000000003
that specific light type direction it's

2522.5 --> 2528.319
yeah it's it's super weird compared to

2525.47 --> 2530.75
just a retro light that's all coming

2528.319 --> 2532.94
from specific pinpoint able locations

2530.75 --> 2538.17
that have distances

2532.94 --> 2544.02
that can be figure it out

2538.17 --> 2546.84
with optics to really establish like how

2544.02 --> 2550.77
it works the intensity that it's coming

2546.84 --> 2554.61
from there the spectrum with distances

2550.77 --> 2559.2599999999998
there's no light spectrum in a in a

2554.61 --> 2561.3900000000003
distance sense you know there is just an

2559.26 --> 2563.9700000000003
analysis here on the earth of the

2561.39 --> 2565.92
intensity of that light supposedly

2563.97 --> 2567.8399999999997
isolated in some way by having like a

2565.92 --> 2569.73
tube that only aims at the star or

2567.84 --> 2578.07
whatever then you get that specific

2569.73 --> 2582.54
light in the tube but yeah it it it's

2578.07 --> 2586.77
not gonna be more light as you bring

2582.54 --> 2588.69
that tube supposedly closer to the where

2586.77 --> 2592.62
you presume to be this whether you

2588.69 --> 2594.32
presume the star to be it's not gonna

2592.62 --> 2597.18
get more intense there's no proof that

2594.32 --> 2601.6200000000003
lights Celestia like gets more intense

2597.18 --> 2605.8199999999997
when you when you think you're getting

2601.62 --> 2608.91
closer to it now with terrestrial light

2605.82 --> 2611.7000000000003
that is very much confirmable that there

2608.91 --> 2617.46
is the word even is a law for it if I'm

2611.7 --> 2623.58
not mistaken I don't remember which one

2617.46 --> 2626.4
it was but yeah I'm going to in the

2623.58 --> 2629.1
future make a distinct difference with

2626.4 --> 2631.4
that terrestrial light celestial light

2629.1 --> 2635.48
the rest your light is what we can make

2631.4 --> 2638.37
Celestia light is this ever-present

2635.48 --> 2642.53
light from the heavens in a damaged

2638.37 --> 2642.5299999999997
sphere visible including the Sun

2663.52 --> 2670.83
Oh wasn't that in an accident all right

2667.96 --> 2670.83
i'll unban him

2683.54 --> 2688.37
it happens don't worry about it

2706.44 --> 2722.9700000000003
Amanda you you're late no oh wait no you

2713.589 --> 2722.97
were already here hmm

2723.029 --> 2728.069
modern English is barely eight hundred

2725.38 --> 2728.069
years old yeah

2739.549 --> 2755.43
hmm all right so see Sanskrit yeah but

2753.089 --> 2757.7
nobody knows how to speak Sanskrit

2755.43 --> 2757.7
though

2769.86 --> 2778.79
also by the way I wonder sometimes now

2775.59 --> 2784.2200000000003
this is just fake speculation now but

2778.79 --> 2788.49
look maybe the most ancient languages

2784.22 --> 2792.45
were never spoken languages like they

2788.49 --> 2794.64
were only written you know how that

2792.45 --> 2798.7799999999997
could be how that could even be like how

2794.64 --> 2802.79
can you just write a language without

2798.78 --> 2807.1000000000004
there being a spoken for a variety of it

2802.79 --> 2810.27
how would that work what you guys think

2807.1 --> 2810.27
[Music]

2816.72 --> 2819.799
I'm asking

2821.07 --> 2824.4500000000003
or I could just say it

2828.48 --> 2836.7400000000002
all right well it could be that the most

2832.45 --> 2840.04
ancient languages were not spoken up

2836.74 --> 2844.18
because of isolation but simply because

2840.04 --> 2847.06
there was no physical need for speaking

2844.18 --> 2851.95
because maybe the default starting out

2847.06 --> 2854.0499999999997
was just telepathy you know and then you

2851.95 --> 2856.2999999999997
might have a need to record something

2854.05 --> 2861.25
outside of a living consciousness you

2856.3 --> 2863.8900000000003
might need writing to yet do that

2861.25 --> 2866.26
but you wouldn't have the need to speak

2863.89 --> 2868.14
it because you could just in the

2866.26 --> 2876.73
presence of another person

2868.14 --> 2878.8289999999997
telepathically communicated see we have

2876.73 --> 2883.03
to take that into account and look at

2878.829 --> 2888.579
the overall like even it's sort of

2883.03 --> 2890.38
proven is it's entropy that genetic

2888.579 --> 2892.1090000000004
design over the age only really

2890.38 --> 2895.38
degenerates

2892.109 --> 2898.66
unless it's artificially altered and

2895.38 --> 2901.06
that we probably our original blueprints

2898.66 --> 2903.0099999999998
were probably like mightily efficient

2901.06 --> 2904.7799999999997
like so much better and it's not just

2903.01 --> 2906.6400000000003
degenerating because of freaking

2904.78 --> 2911.17
vaccines and bad food and [ __ ] and

2906.64 --> 2914.77
psychological warfare but just gradual

2911.17 --> 2918.9
damage over the ages that yeah a certain

2914.77 --> 2921.579
point certain peak traits are kind of

2918.9 --> 2928.05
they're kind of damaged out of existence

2921.579 --> 2931.6600000000003
and we may still have like the scarred

2928.05 --> 2933.6090000000004
remnants of them so it would be like

2931.66 --> 2937.93
exactly the other way around of

2933.609 --> 2939.16
evolution instead of new things arriving

2937.93 --> 2941.1699999999996
out of nothing no it's the other way

2939.16 --> 2945.359
around no we probably have these amazing

2941.17 --> 2950.5
traits but they've retracted into a

2945.359 --> 2952.15
mutant remnant as it were within the

2950.5 --> 2956.8
spectrum of our abilities which are

2952.15 --> 2959.44
still still pretty amazing but I think

2956.8 --> 2961.8
it's very likely that originally we were

2959.44 --> 2964.27
probably just telepathic

2961.8 --> 2965.9500000000003
and I also think that it's great

2964.27 --> 2969.099
likelihood that there's animals out

2965.95 --> 2974.29
there that are telepathic too or have

2969.099 --> 2976.98
certain telepathic abilities and I think

2974.29 --> 2979.5099999999998
that even humans still do have certain

2976.98 --> 2982.15
correlating abilities to like that have

2979.51 --> 2984.46
to do with your instincts and sensing

2982.15 --> 2987.099
somebody coming and all that that does

2984.46 --> 2989.71
route into telepathy it's just not a

2987.099 --> 2992.7000000000003
direct tap into and communicate for

2989.71 --> 3000.29
rinde of it but it is basically the same

2992.7 --> 3000.29
route ability in my opinion so yeah

3007.64 --> 3013.91
yeah and that by the way just imagine

3011.06 --> 3015.7999999999997
that now that I'm thinking about it when

3013.91 --> 3019.97
I'm approaching this situation and

3015.8 --> 3021.8900000000003
Babylon then maybe they simply didn't

3019.97 --> 3024.3199999999997
need to speak a language because they

3021.89 --> 3026.99
just were telepathic it's like a

3024.32 --> 3029.0
universal translator in Star Trek except

3026.99 --> 3035.8999999999996
it was in their heads and it had always

3029.0 --> 3038.51
been there and then if suddenly is it no

3035.9 --> 3041.75
longer works what the [ __ ]

3038.51 --> 3048.32
then suddenly everybody resorts has to

3041.75 --> 3053.84
figure out how to yeah how to do it in

3048.32 --> 3056.53
another way how to communicate out of

3053.84 --> 3056.53
nothing basically

3066.08 --> 3071.9
now Gideon's sake instincts do or at

3069.77 --> 3074.45
least it depends you know instinct is a

3071.9 --> 3078.02
wider concept but there are definitely

3074.45 --> 3082.12
things that some people can do have

3078.02 --> 3087.98
access to with their instincts that

3082.12 --> 3092.66
border telepathy abilities like in yeah

3087.98 --> 3097.03
sensory super perceptual sensory

3092.66 --> 3097.0299999999997
abilities and animals have it too

3121.19 --> 3128.69
all right good servant but yeah but when

3123.65 --> 3134.39
God spoke would that be wouldn't that

3128.69 --> 3137.75
logically be not necessarily why would

3134.39 --> 3139.5989999999997
he speak with a mouth isn't it just the

3137.75 --> 3142.99
thought isn't it basically just

3139.599 --> 3142.9900000000002
manifesting thought

3158.16 --> 3165.39
but yeah who knows maybe originally

3161.22 --> 3167.22
things like speaking or conveying in

3165.39 --> 3170.089
communication the words that were used

3167.22 --> 3174.89
weren't even necessarily meant for

3170.089 --> 3177.9
verbal communication it's simply about

3174.89 --> 3180.089
communication it could have started out

3177.9 --> 3184.2000000000003
like that and then when the telepathy

3180.089 --> 3186.66
was kind of lost that it been the

3184.2 --> 3191.21
meaning simply moved on to verbal

3186.66 --> 3191.21
communication never considered that all

3195.41 --> 3200.779
right we do have vocal cords that's

3198.539 --> 3200.779
right

3203.8 --> 3212.5600000000004
but yeah so do animals they don't speak

3208.09 --> 3218.34
languages they do communicate they give

3212.56 --> 3222.5099999999998
the its expression based and procreation

3218.34 --> 3222.51
involvement and all that you know

3241.44 --> 3244.44
okay

3244.56 --> 3252.18
right well they speak their own language

3248.04 --> 3255.15
is now but you know maybe if it was just

3252.18 --> 3257.91
a thing that God altered with life

3255.15 --> 3262.07
itself then maybe the animals were

3257.91 --> 3264.66
telepathic and humans maybe all mammals

3262.07 --> 3266.8500000000004
in that direction like intelligent

3264.66 --> 3271.0699999999997
animals were telepathic and then it all

3266.85 --> 3271.0699999999997
changed and it all had to adapt

3291.83 --> 3295.1
they spoke like men they didn't in the

3293.54 --> 3301.13
garden of egen well there you go Tom

3295.1 --> 3303.38
Parker see this is what I do there's

3301.13 --> 3306.29
just things in there you don't even

3303.38 --> 3308.48
realize could be there and this is one

3306.29 --> 3311.69
of them it's like yeah it could be that

3308.48 --> 3313.88
originally telepathic communication was

3311.69 --> 3316.19
the standard and then just realize what

3313.88 --> 3317.7200000000003
if that were the case what would be the

3316.19 --> 3319.46
result well there would be no spoken

3317.72 --> 3326.06
language and would still be written

3319.46 --> 3329.66
language and and the same goes for

3326.06 --> 3331.7
animals and who knows maybe at that

3329.66 --> 3333.98
point yeah well if people could

3331.7 --> 3336.77
communicate telepathically with animals

3333.98 --> 3338.42
saying that they could speak then maybe

3336.77 --> 3341.21
animals could do that with one another

3338.42 --> 3343.82
and maybe thinking about that yeah what

3341.21 --> 3346.93
if that suddenly went away well an

3343.82 --> 3349.3700000000003
animal if they couldn't basically

3346.93 --> 3350.1499999999996
communicate directly with another animal

3349.37 --> 3354.17
anymore

3350.15 --> 3360.82
might be less reluctant to kill and eat

3354.17 --> 3363.82
that animal see it's just practical

3360.82 --> 3363.82
consequences

3364.45 --> 3371.64
this is yeah this is an interesting idea

3367.56 --> 3379.15
just came afloat

3371.64 --> 3381.96
Tower of Babel and yeah the Adam and Eve

3379.15 --> 3381.96
situation

3389.47 --> 3393.64
anyway I'm gonna round out the show but

3391.45 --> 3396.5989999999997
that was an interesting way to end the

3393.64 --> 3399.97
show I'm gonna think about this one

3396.599 --> 3403.3
anyway thanks everyone for coming I hope

3399.97 --> 3405.069
you guys liked the show if you did then

3432.069 --> 3439.81
number 594 on the Friday edition and I'm

3436.24 --> 3442.7099999999996
gonna join the Flat Earth debates right

3439.81 --> 3447.16
after this it's start up any second

3442.71 --> 3450.55
hashtag MIFA indeed steve michael roark

3447.16 --> 3452.8289999999997
good servant Amanda young alright I

3450.55 --> 3456.6400000000003
really gotta have that hat made at some

3452.829 --> 3459.94
point it's been laying in the back of

3456.64 --> 3461.6189999999997
the store the store of ideas for a long

3459.94 --> 3464.17
time I should really get that hat at

3461.619 --> 3468.069
some point I think I might be able to

3464.17 --> 3471.2200000000003
finance it because I had to like order

3468.069 --> 3473.95
at least a hundred and that was kind of

3471.22 --> 3476.6189999999997
expensive well maybe that will get in

3473.95 --> 3484.48
range a little better to actually try

3476.619 --> 3486.76
that so we'll see no not Mika kind of

3484.48 --> 3491.5
time you I if you say that again

3486.76 --> 3494.3100000000004
anyway right until the next video keep

3491.5 --> 3524.65
it flat

3494.31 --> 3524.65
