269.24 --> 274.12
heard good things about it and so I

277.16 --> 280.639
watched it and yeah it was

good like it was basically nothing like

287.52 --> 290.35999999999996
that was really

293.4 --> 299.0
annoying

294.96 --> 301.68
H and there was like endless references

299.0 --> 303.72
to like the games endless endless

301.68 --> 306.24
references

303.72 --> 308.56
music as to like the things that were

306.24 --> 311.72
there everything was from all the Mario

308.56 --> 314.36

you

342.79 --> 349.699
[Music]

358.479 --> 361.479
uh

364.08 --> 366.4
where is

371.72 --> 375.16
it

373.28 --> 378.67999999999995
uh damn

375.16 --> 380.36
it there's another movie I watched which

378.68 --> 383.759
I thought was kind of going to be shitty

380.36 --> 383.759
but it turned out to be pretty

384.24 --> 388.24
good I forgot the dam

388.4 --> 391.4
name

395.56 --> 398.639
see if I can find

418.4 --> 421.4
it

428.96 --> 432.039
this is

432.44 --> 440.199
crazy I type a Word I'm sure is in

436.319 --> 444.56
name and it literally shows me

440.199 --> 446.52000000000004
like 50 other things that don't have

444.56 --> 451.319
that word in the

446.52 --> 451.31899999999996
name instead of it

463.68 --> 466.52
let try

478.319 --> 481.319
this

486.4 --> 490.12
it's

487.599 --> 493.56
literally a movie I watched just

490.12 --> 497.52
yesterday and again on Netflix Oh try to

493.56 --> 500.599
find the name try to find the name it's

497.52 --> 502.71999999999997
like it does its absolute best to just

500.599 --> 505.56
prevent you from figuring out what you

502.72 --> 508.24
watch the previous

505.56 --> 511.24
day I

508.24 --> 511.24
mean

511.84 --> 516.8389999999999
the the algorithm is just like yeah go

514.479 --> 519.6800000000001
screw yourself we don't want you to

516.839 --> 523.24
remember what you watched I mean if

519.68 --> 526.959
somebody's going to type the name in a

523.24 --> 529.48
search that has reminiscence to

526.959 --> 532.0
something you watched the day before

529.48 --> 534.24
wouldn't the algorithm automatically

532.0 --> 536.279
isn't it supposed to conclude like oh

534.24 --> 538.48
he's trying to figure out what he just

536.279 --> 542.36
watched It's like oh what did you just

538.48 --> 545.16
type in right right no no it doesn't do

542.36 --> 545.16
that at

545.399 --> 550.2
all it's like oh no we have no idea what

548.64 --> 554.16
you were talking about the thing that

550.2 --> 554.1600000000001
you just watched not even eight hours

555.64 --> 558.64
ago

560.079 --> 568.12
uh yeah they

563.279 --> 571.12
do they do hide the things you

568.12 --> 571.12
watch

572.2 --> 576.32
and there is a way to get it I

579.12 --> 585.72
think but

581.519 --> 585.72
it's it's a massive

598.12 --> 601.12
hassle

628.04 --> 631.04
[ __ ]

631.36 --> 633.88
oh my

647.16 --> 650.6
God wait is

650.88 --> 654.2
it wait

655.079 --> 660.7199999999999
what

658.04 --> 663.12
oh

660.72 --> 665.44
I'm sorry guys this is like ruining the

663.12 --> 668.36
start of the

665.44 --> 673.399
show if you watched it in the browser it

668.36 --> 677.72
would be that's a good point dank that's

673.399 --> 680.399
I I hadn't even thought of that

677.72 --> 685.0790000000001
yeah I feel kind of stupid that I didn't

680.399 --> 687.6
come up with that you're right

685.079 --> 691.8389999999999
although the problem

687.6 --> 695.9590000000001
is like in the browser data it it

691.839 --> 695.9590000000001
doesn't it just says

696.88 --> 704.36
Netflix it I don't think it like

701.48 --> 706.44
directly links to like the thing that

704.36 --> 709.32
you were

706.44 --> 712.36
watching

709.32 --> 714.6
yeah like if I do this I'm pretty sure

712.36 --> 717.6
at this point I was watching that

714.6 --> 717.6
movie

717.959 --> 723.0
and

719.88 --> 725.279
oh wait is it

723.0 --> 729.73
actually oh didn't show that in the

725.279 --> 732.879
browser data but I I guess that

729.73 --> 732.879
[Music]

733.839 --> 741.8000000000001
yeah ah there you go

737.839 --> 741.8000000000001
right there you go I found

745.76 --> 753.24
it uh I know my own browser is stuck

749.959 --> 753.2399999999999
yeah it was called money

754.0 --> 759.079
monster and it was like sort of a

756.16 --> 761.36
hostage thing but it

759.079 --> 763.56
was kind of

761.36 --> 765.5600000000001
interesting like it's interesting how

763.56 --> 767.0
they managed to make an entire movie

765.56 --> 770.959
around

767.0 --> 773.56
it but it was like a George Clooney

770.959 --> 776.56
movie with Sandra Bullock I think in

773.56 --> 781.199
there or was it somebody else I think it

776.56 --> 783.16
was her but it was was surprisingly

781.199 --> 784.8
interesting like at the start of it I

783.16 --> 789.0
thought like oh god what the [ __ ] is

784.8 --> 792.7199999999999
this going to be but then like one third

789.0 --> 796.16
in it was like yeah this is this is

792.72 --> 799.76
interesting it took like psychological

796.16 --> 799.76
turns you not really

800.6 --> 806.48
expect yeah but yeah hey dank it worked

803.68 --> 808.4399999999999
I'm going to try to remember that one

806.48 --> 809.279
you can just go in the browser history

808.44 --> 811.839
and then

809.279 --> 813.959
even though it doesn't say what it is

811.839 --> 816.24
when you do click it it does go back to

813.959 --> 820.079
that movie that you watch that's a good

816.24 --> 822.76
one I'll try to remember that it'll save

820.079 --> 822.76
me a lot of

827.279 --> 831.6
time right anyway who's in

834.92 --> 840.759
here hello

837.759 --> 840.759
Wrath

857.36 --> 860.0790000000001
all right well

861.8 --> 866.3199999999999
whatever YouTube just keeps on freezing

865.0 --> 870.68
the the

866.32 --> 870.6800000000001
video it's annoying

870.839 --> 875.5600000000001
right as long as the OBS just keeps

872.639 --> 877.279
stable that's all fine though I don't

875.56 --> 879.68
know if your you guys are having some

877.279 --> 881.639
trouble like with

879.68 --> 884.7589999999999
the with the

881.639 --> 887.759
feed I hope

884.759 --> 887.759
not

893.24 --> 896.24
anyhow

897.68 --> 900.68
hey

910.32 --> 918.279
the pathless path

913.519 --> 918.279
okay that sounds kind of contradictory

924.08 --> 927.269
[Music]

927.6 --> 930.6
Wrath

931.19 --> 934.399
[Music]

947.24 --> 949.92
all right all

957.6 --> 960.6
right

983.8 --> 986.3599999999999
all right all

987.519 --> 990.519
right

992.91 --> 995.9599999999999
[Music]

1003.16 --> 1010.7199999999999
it's about realizing that we are all one

1006.639 --> 1010.72
Consciousness where are you getting that

1017.48 --> 1022.1990000000001
from

1019.24 --> 1026.0
like it's a really bizarre thing to say

1022.199 --> 1028.36
that we are one Consciousness when our

1026.0 --> 1031.799
Consciousness being our own unique

1028.36 --> 1035.1989999999998
experience is what really keeps us

1031.799 --> 1039.12
apart like we're not one

1035.199 --> 1042.28
Consciousness just because our

1039.12 --> 1044.3999999999999
consciouses are very similar and like

1042.28 --> 1046.8799999999999
they always kind of follow the same type

1044.4 --> 1049.5590000000002
of patterns with like

1046.88 --> 1051.44
side side pattern

1049.559 --> 1054.6789999999999
like another way of doing

1051.44 --> 1057.44
it like how the conscious

1054.679 --> 1061.039
functions is practically the

1057.44 --> 1065.3600000000001
same like you can test that with

1061.039 --> 1067.799
people but I mean we're literally not

1065.36 --> 1067.799
want

1070.32 --> 1075.36
Consciousness like the whole point about

1072.48 --> 1078.96
the Consciousness is that it is

1075.36 --> 1081.1589999999999
conscious that it's like one thing right

1078.96 --> 1084.799
there right

1081.159 --> 1087.44
then it's the separation that makes it

1084.799 --> 1087.44
unique

1089.48 --> 1096.64
so but I mean on the other hand we are

1092.84 --> 1098.6
all connected to the designer to the

1096.64 --> 1101.72
Creator so we

1098.6 --> 1104.24
all come from the same Consciousness You

1101.72 --> 1107.28
could argue right we you can argue we

1104.24 --> 1107.28
all come from the

1107.32 --> 1110.32
designer

1112.52 --> 1116.679
but we're not literally

1120.799 --> 1127.48
one separated from God and one another

1123.6 --> 1127.48
no no that that you don't have to do

1128.0 --> 1134.36
that you can connect up but that doesn't

1130.84 --> 1136.6
mean that you are the same it just means

1134.36 --> 1139.3999999999999
you can connect up and

1136.6 --> 1141.9189999999999
people tend to

1139.4 --> 1144.2
underestimate their own abilities with

1141.919 --> 1144.2
their

1146.76 --> 1152.1589999999999
Spirit but that doesn't mean we are all

1149.4 --> 1155.039
one Consciousness that's like

1152.159 --> 1157.0
a kind of a hippie dippy phrase that's

1155.039 --> 1160.64
been

1157.0 --> 1165.08
outdated like that's like just no just

1160.64 --> 1168.8400000000001
no it's literally no that's like it

1165.08 --> 1172.039
defies the very Core Essence of what

1168.84 --> 1172.039
what a conscious

1172.08 --> 1178.24
is it doesn't do that it's separated

1176.0 --> 1180.76
that it's separated is what makes it a

1178.24 --> 1182.1200000000001
conscious if it's not separated then

1180.76 --> 1185.679
you're just a

1182.12 --> 1188.2399999999998
collective we aren't a collective we are

1185.679 --> 1191.6000000000001
a separate

1188.24 --> 1193.0
individual hey yeah I knew I was

1191.6 --> 1195.7199999999998
wondering when you're going to show up

1193.0 --> 1195.72
seeking star

1197.24 --> 1200.24
water

1201.919 --> 1209.44
welcome is the life within you different

1205.48 --> 1212.44
from the life within someone else

1209.44 --> 1212.44
yeah

1213.44 --> 1221.72
definitely yeah if that someone else

1217.52 --> 1224.32
died I can go on perfectly fine if I

1221.72 --> 1226.52
died then potentially that someone else

1224.32 --> 1230.1589999999999
could just go on without ever even

1226.52 --> 1230.1589999999999
knowing yeah

1234.159 --> 1241.0390000000002
yeah the life within me is different

1237.4 --> 1241.039
from the life within somebody

1244.919 --> 1252.88
else they're a separate life now the The

1248.48 --> 1256.76
Roots may all sh we may share a common

1252.88 --> 1260.6000000000001
ancestral root with arguably

1256.76 --> 1263.32
everything but Our Roots doesn't mean

1260.6 --> 1266.84
that we're all

1263.32 --> 1269.8799999999999
one maybe from the perspective of the

1266.84 --> 1273.1589999999999
Timeless Dimension which is not where we

1269.88 --> 1275.679
live actually it's a part of us is

1273.159 --> 1277.919
there but our Consciousness is mostly

1275.679 --> 1282.679
within the time linear

1277.919 --> 1282.679
space and yeah we are separate

1287.039 --> 1290.039
there

1293.159 --> 1297.0390000000002
it's the same energy that animates

1298.039 --> 1305.12
everyone yeah but that's an external

1302.48 --> 1307.279
influence you could say or unless if

1305.12 --> 1308.559
you're talking about the very thing that

1307.279 --> 1312.559
keeps them

1308.559 --> 1316.08
alive no that's not the same energy it's

1312.559 --> 1319.12
the same system it's it's like saying oh

1316.08 --> 1321.0
this engine is the same as that engine

1319.12 --> 1322.9189999999999
they came from the same

1321.0 --> 1325.799
Factory but

1322.919 --> 1327.44
yeah this engine is in that car of that

1325.799 --> 1329.4
guy and that engine is in that car of

1327.44 --> 1330.64
that guy and now that engine oh yeah

1329.4 --> 1333.279
it's breaking

1330.64 --> 1335.5200000000002
down does that mean that all engines are

1333.279 --> 1339.559
all now going to break down immediately

1335.52 --> 1342.08
no because they're not the same

1339.559 --> 1346.2
things just because you come from the

1342.08 --> 1346.1999999999998
same thing doesn't mean you're the same

1346.96 --> 1349.96
thing

1352.159 --> 1357.159
I mean you could think of them as the

1353.76 --> 1359.76
same thing in like a hippie dippy over

1357.159 --> 1362.6000000000001
generalization but they aren't they're

1359.76 --> 1362.6
two separate

1373.039 --> 1379.48
things right it always makes me think

1376.6 --> 1381.9599999999998
like like the just really bad at math or

1379.48 --> 1385.64
something it's like oh yeah we're two

1381.96 --> 1390.679
but we're actually one like no two is

1385.64 --> 1393.0800000000002
two one is one two consists of two * one

1390.679 --> 1397.2
like you're not going to make it

1393.08 --> 1399.0
one just like 2 plus 2 isn't five like

1397.2 --> 1402.24
just

1399.0 --> 1405.32
no it is what it is you can't change

1402.24 --> 1406.24
what it is how it works cuz it is what

1405.32 --> 1408.48
it

1406.24 --> 1410.919
is can't just

1408.48 --> 1413.72
rearrange everything to make it into

1410.919 --> 1417.6000000000001
something else because your mind in that

1413.72 --> 1419.3600000000001
moment sought the need to be a God and

1417.6 --> 1424.039

part of their yeah no they were mearian

1522.279 --> 1527.84
almost right but yeah I mean ter I don't

1525.52 --> 1530.8799999999999
know everything about Vikings just so

1527.84 --> 1530.8799999999999
know I'm no Viking

1531.72 --> 1536.96
expert I've been a bit interested

1534.32 --> 1540.36
because of the the self-sufficiency

1536.96 --> 1542.76
factor that they did have in a

1540.36 --> 1546.1589999999999
way there's plenty of other things that

1542.76 --> 1546.1589999999999
I really didn't like about

1550.12 --> 1558.7199999999998
him wanted to try snake meat

1554.559 --> 1561.0
okay or inquire you mean in chire you

1558.72 --> 1563.64
wanted to know about snake meat okay

1561.0 --> 1566.399
well snake meat from what I I've never

1563.64 --> 1570.039
tasted it but it it from what I heard it

1566.399 --> 1572.799
tastes like chicken but has like the

1570.039 --> 1578.44
substance like a an old

1572.799 --> 1578.44
tire so it's kind of rubbery as

1580.2 --> 1583.76
meat hope that

1586.6 --> 1589.6
helps

1607.399 --> 1613.8799999999999
do restaurants here serve it I don't

1610.12 --> 1618.52
think so I mean there might be some like

1613.88 --> 1621.24
Niche super Niche meat restaurant thing

1618.52 --> 1624.84
where you might be able to order

1621.24 --> 1627.48
it but I mean it's not definitely not a

1624.84 --> 1630.039
common thing we we don't have snakes all

1627.48 --> 1633.64
over the place

1630.039 --> 1637.2
here to eat besides

1633.64 --> 1639.3200000000002
like chicken tastes a lot better like

1637.2 --> 1641.8400000000001
chicken tastes like chicken too except

1639.32 --> 1645.0
it it's not like

1641.84 --> 1649.039
robber now snakes I

1645.0 --> 1651.279
mean you can eat snakes but I don't know

1649.039 --> 1653.64
for the life of me why somebody would

1651.279 --> 1656.799
want to industrialize that so that

1653.64 --> 1658.7990000000002
everybody could keep eating snakes like

1656.799 --> 1661.32
it's not that

1658.799 --> 1664.12
good I mean if you're starving in the

1661.32 --> 1667.48
middle of like the desert and and you

1664.12 --> 1671.559
had had a meal in like days then yeah

1667.48 --> 1674.45
snake meat's going to be epic but other

2050.119 --> 2053.639
just on the other side we're

2056.839 --> 2064.159

what are you doing on twitch that's the

2110.96 --> 2114.88
somebody playing a video game and then

2112.839 --> 2118.52
you brought up Flat Earth or

2114.88 --> 2118.52
something that might do

2125.8 --> 2128.8
it

2135.88 --> 2141.04
is is jeem Panda doing gaming streams

2151.319 --> 2157.24
yet just playing play Space games on

with Globes all day long and talk about

2157.24 --> 2164.2799999999997
how flat earthers are stupid I mean they

2160.24 --> 2167.4399999999996
probably should do that just do it go do

2164.28 --> 2167.44
that why

2181.76 --> 2185.5600000000004
not twitch is for

2185.72 --> 2188.72
tweakers

2207.96 --> 2213.92
very perceptive there tomino 3 I was

2211.52 --> 2217.68
harping on about that in

2213.92 --> 2221.2400000000002
2016 can you believe it

2217.68 --> 2222.319
but yeah no no that specifically isn't

2221.24 --> 2224.9199999999996
isn't that

2222.319 --> 2227.92
interesting they don't know how to

2224.92 --> 2231.76
transition

2227.92 --> 2234.92
from getting off the Earth and into

2231.76 --> 2237.3590000000004
space and it becoming a ball they always

2234.92 --> 2241.28
switch

2237.359 --> 2244.839
scenes right in every series every

2241.28 --> 2246.96
movie even the good ones like you have

2244.839 --> 2249.72
to separate scenes you can't have it in

2246.96 --> 2249.7200000000003
a singular

2249.839 --> 2255.359
shot cuz that'll make like that'll like

2252.839 --> 2258.599
warp your

2255.359 --> 2260.88
mind like if you can actually see it

2258.599 --> 2264.8
like you'll know like this is fake

2260.88 --> 2264.8
you'll see that it was being

2266.92 --> 2270.599
bent because at the ground level it's

2269.359 --> 2273.0789999999997
not

2270.599 --> 2275.1600000000003
curved doesn't really curve when you go

2273.079 --> 2277.8390000000004
up you just see that Horizon and then

2275.16 --> 2280.92
they have to like just like oh you have

2277.839 --> 2283.56
the high and the Horizon then it's like

2280.92 --> 2285.319
okay another scene from another angle

2283.56 --> 2287.0
and then oh oh it's oh it's now it's

2285.319 --> 2287.96
spherical you got enough distance and

2287.0 --> 2290.68
now it's

2287.96 --> 2294.28
spherical with the scene switch they

2290.68 --> 2296.68
have to do that you can't do it another

2294.28 --> 2300.44
way otherwise you just see like Yep

2296.68 --> 2303.1189999999997
they're just bending the the straight

2300.44 --> 2308.04
lines because yeah they don't want you

2303.119 --> 2310.8
to see that part to figure that out

2308.04 --> 2310.8
it breaks the

2320.04 --> 2326.359
spell but in movies intros they move

2323.48 --> 2328.48
from space to the ground on Earth yeah

2326.359 --> 2330.7999999999997
but that's just a stupid zoom in trick

2328.48 --> 2330.8
that's

2335.52 --> 2338.52
different

2339.28 --> 2345.079
you can't just zoom out and then claim

2342.319 --> 2348.4
you're traveling everybody knows that

2345.079 --> 2348.4
like no that's not what that

2362.04 --> 2367.96

late I literally woke up exactly at

2454.8 --> 2461.48
1:00 and then I just just like oh but

2457.92 --> 2463.64
with energy though but yeah that's late

2461.48 --> 2466.2
and then it's like ah got to put it

2463.64 --> 2468.48
together and quick but I did kind of

2466.2 --> 2470.7999999999997
stay focused at least sometimes it's

2468.48 --> 2474.16
just like when I get up it's

2470.8 --> 2478.119
like I get distracted and then like time

2474.16 --> 2478.1189999999997
just flies but it it wasn't like

2485.24 --> 2488.24
that

2497.28 --> 2502.48
right but anyway guys I don't really

2500.0 --> 2504.4
have something new to talk about or

2502.48 --> 2506.599
anything other than oh movies I watch

2504.4 --> 2506.599
the

2507.359 --> 2512.68
movies nothing else is really popping in

2509.839 --> 2514.44
my mind and I'm sure it will again

2512.68 --> 2516.96
tomorrow so if there's anything you

2514.44 --> 2519.56
specifically want to talk about that I

2516.96 --> 2520.76
talked about recently want me to dig

2519.56 --> 2523.52
through

2520.76 --> 2527.2400000000002
it then just

2523.52 --> 2527.24
ask and we'll go through

2529.92 --> 2535.079
it my shows recently are getting good

2532.96 --> 2538.079
views aren't

2535.079 --> 2538.079
they

2538.68 --> 2544.839
like 300

2542.2 --> 2546.5589999999997
260 we getting good pretty good views I

2544.839 --> 2549.0
guess it's because of the Christmas time

2546.559 --> 2551.63
because there's not that many other

2549.0 --> 2554.689
streams I think not

2551.63 --> 2554.6890000000003
[Music]

2554.839 --> 2561.68
sure anyway any all the new subscribers

2558.4 --> 2563.44
welcome to the early word show hey

2561.68 --> 2565.64
mystical Rock hounds and fossil good to

2563.44 --> 2565.64
see

2566.04 --> 2572.2
you the shows are now one hour no ter

2569.48 --> 2575.8
I'm just terrible I'm just late every

2572.2 --> 2578.04
time they're not just one hour that that

2575.8 --> 2583.44
was a bit of an

2578.04 --> 2586.359
idea like in this like a week ago but no

2583.44 --> 2588.7200000000003
I'm I'm actually trying to be on

2586.359 --> 2591.839
time it's just

2588.72 --> 2594.9599999999996
that with all those storms going on like

2591.839 --> 2596.29
all night long it's really tough to like

2594.96 --> 2600.919
get to

2596.29 --> 2600.919
[Music]

2604.599 --> 2610.28
bed right so technically it's a 2hour

2607.8 --> 2614.8390000000004
show but it often ends up being one and

2610.28 --> 2615.92
a half hour show around that 20 minutes

2614.839 --> 2619.119
140

2615.92 --> 2622.83
minutes but I mean I try to make up in

2619.119 --> 2625.04
the weekends by doing like three hour

2622.83 --> 2629.319
[Music]

2625.04 --> 2632.7599999999998
shows right because the issue also is

2629.319 --> 2636.68
that weekdays I

2632.76 --> 2638.96
am in front of the Flat Earth debates

2636.68 --> 2641.24
and Nathan does definitely always start

2638.96 --> 2641.2400000000002
on

2642.33 --> 2647.7999999999997
[Music]

2645.0 --> 2650.52
time so if I'm late then it's just going

2647.8 --> 2653.7200000000003
to be shorter unless Nathan doesn't have

2650.52 --> 2658.599
a show but he mostly

2653.72 --> 2658.5989999999997
does Fallout more oh

2662.72 --> 2667.2799999999997
[Music]

2665.0 --> 2671.319
God

2667.28 --> 2672.2900000000004
H okay D okay what whatever you like if

2671.319 --> 2674.16
you think that's

2672.29 --> 2676.5589999999997
[Music]

2674.16 --> 2680.8799999999997
fun I almost thought I could like play

2676.559 --> 2683.0
Diablo 4 but it requires Windows

2680.88 --> 2684.359
10 yeah [ __ ]

2683.0 --> 2687.4
[Music]

2684.359 --> 2689.0
you let me first say no it doesn't

2687.4 --> 2691.62
that's a

2689.0 --> 2694.96
lie you just made it like

2691.62 --> 2697.8399999999997
[Music]

2694.96 --> 2701.559
that

2697.84 --> 2703.48
[Music]

2701.559 --> 2705.0
and from everything I've seen it doesn't

2703.48 --> 2708.4
even look all that

2705.0 --> 2711.48
impressive compared to the previous

2708.4 --> 2714.48
one but the game play might be better or

2711.48 --> 2716.16
something who cares I'm not going to

2714.48 --> 2718.2400000000002
play it because I'm not going to upgrade

2716.16 --> 2720.839
to Windows

2718.24 --> 2723.5589999999997
10 not with this computer anyway I

2720.839 --> 2726.92
wouldn't want to risk like a setting

2723.559 --> 2729.52
that's been stable for like 10 years

2726.92 --> 2732.76
definitely not oh just upgrading the

2729.52 --> 2736.16
operating system what could go wrong

2732.76 --> 2736.1600000000003
except absolutely

2737.24 --> 2741.16
everything right so if I'm going to do

2739.319 --> 2743.68
that I'll have to like make a new

2741.16 --> 2747.64
operating

2743.68 --> 2747.64
system and then I might try

2748.8 --> 2755.0
it like I might try it out like oh I'll

2751.76 --> 2758.559
just have a install of Windows 10 or

2755.0 --> 2761.359
whatever and then plug it in and let's

2758.559 --> 2764.559
see like what that's

2761.359 --> 2767.52
like keeping my

2764.559 --> 2770.59
old disc you know so they could just

2767.52 --> 2776.939
always just click back to the old

2770.59 --> 2776.9390000000003
[Music]

2784.8 --> 2791.1600000000003
system

2786.76 --> 2791.1600000000003
which brand of physics you find

2791.2 --> 2798.16
fascinating

2793.52 --> 2798.16
uh me personally I'm very interested in

2801.0 --> 2808.44
turbulence like turbulence is really one

2803.68 --> 2808.44
of the most fascinating properties of

2809.079 --> 2817.8
matter right and it is like mostly even

2813.8 --> 2817.8
within air

2819.24 --> 2824.5989999999997
and gases are when you really think

2822.44 --> 2827.359
about it gases are actually kind of

2824.599 --> 2831.92
mysterious like the form of gases are

2827.359 --> 2834.5589999999997
it's really weird it is really

2831.92 --> 2837.44
weird I mean when you really think about

2834.559 --> 2839.599
it it's logical that it took a while

2837.44 --> 2841.319
before the Ancients even figured out it

2839.599 --> 2844.7200000000003
was

2841.319 --> 2847.72
something because it's so

2844.72 --> 2847.72
elusive

2847.96 --> 2854.48
but turbulence studies

2851.64 --> 2857.52
aerodynamics like there's very specific

2854.48 --> 2860.359
patterns that happen with gases as they

2857.52 --> 2863.48
move and that's turbulence and I find

2860.359 --> 2865.4
how that works and the details of it

2863.48 --> 2868.4
very very

2865.4 --> 2871.48
fascinating because if you truly Master

2868.4 --> 2874.7200000000003
it then you can like have engineering

2871.48 --> 2877.04
Feats that just seem completely

2874.72 --> 2879.4399999999996
impossible you can just do it with it

2877.04 --> 2882.119
because you got the turbulence like you

2879.44 --> 2884.92
totally designed something with that and

2882.119 --> 2888.1600000000003
create an effect and it's just like

2884.92 --> 2891.04
what how's that happening yeah that's

2888.16 --> 2894.7599999999998
the shape turbulence air is keeping it

2891.04 --> 2899.389
like that right that sort of thing

2894.76 --> 2899.389
[Music]

2900.24 --> 2906.3999999999996
amazing so turbulence

2902.88 --> 2910.6800000000003
physics and Engineering very

2906.4 --> 2914.119
awesome had iced coffee

2910.68 --> 2917.3399999999997
okay pool is

2914.119 --> 2920.409
fun yeah I played a lot of pool in the

2917.34 --> 2920.409
[Music]

2921.359 --> 2928.68
past like we had we even had like a pool

2925.319 --> 2930.839
table at my grandmother's old

2928.68 --> 2934.52
farmhouse when we all got together there

2930.839 --> 2934.52
there was a pool table that was pretty

2934.599 --> 2937.599
cool

2943.2 --> 2946.8799999999997
I'm going to get my coffee be right

2948.63 --> 2964.199
[Music]

2964.52 --> 2967.52
back

2973.69 --> 2986.92
[Music]

2994.52 --> 2997.52
for

3005.079 --> 3011.119
so hilarious man the white cat sitting

3008.0 --> 3011.119
in front of the window

3013.92 --> 3018.44
again he's always doing that so that

3016.68 --> 3020.7599999999998
it's like oh let me in and then I let

3018.44 --> 3023.4
him in but sometimes he's just in a

3020.76 --> 3025.7200000000003
weird mood and he's like he thinks he

3023.4 --> 3029.04
can mind control me he's like sitting

3025.72 --> 3033.799
there and just like like you are going

3029.04 --> 3036.04
to open it up for me and like no I'm not

3033.799 --> 3037.88
he's like trying to hypnotize me like

3036.04 --> 3041.48
sitting there looking in a very specific

3037.88 --> 3045.44
way like you really want to open the

3041.48 --> 3047.04
door like no I really don't but

3045.44 --> 3048.119
sometimes I really do it does actually

3047.04 --> 3052.5589999999997
work

3048.119 --> 3054.44
sometimes I mean that cat's like a

3052.559 --> 3056.6400000000003
sophisticated

3054.44 --> 3058.7200000000003
manipulator

3056.64 --> 3061.359
it's like one of those entertainment

3058.72 --> 3064.16
cats that's really aware of its

3061.359 --> 3064.16
influence on

3064.28 --> 3068.119
humans that white cat's

3071.079 --> 3075.079
awesome

3072.88 --> 3077.2400000000002
[Music]

3075.079 --> 3080.76
anyway don't think today's show is going

3077.24 --> 3080.7599999999998
to have a title it's all over the

3081.64 --> 3087.359
place cats love doing the Mind

3084.359 --> 3087.359
meld

3096.88 --> 3101.28
indeed God this thing is making a lot of

3106.799 --> 3110.599
noise that's helps at

3111.839 --> 3117.359
least what's

3114.359 --> 3117.359
that

3119.119 --> 3126.79
yeah sorry guys just wasting everybody's

3124.359 --> 3130.65
time uh all

3126.79 --> 3130.65
[Music]

3130.96 --> 3136.839
right cats know we have a shared

3133.88 --> 3136.839
Consciousness

3139.88 --> 3147.28
no but cats are very strong on the other

3144.28 --> 3147.28
side

3147.599 --> 3150.4
my cats have

3150.799 --> 3157.119
a they just have a very strong

3154.44 --> 3160.41
awareness cats have a very high

3157.119 --> 3163.48
awareness and a very specific

3160.41 --> 3163.48
[Music]

3169.599 --> 3175.799
type this whole shared Consciousness uh

3172.88 --> 3177.559
it's nonsense rra it really is

3175.799 --> 3179.119
we don't share Consciousness the whole

3177.559 --> 3179.98
point about your Consciousness is that

3179.119 --> 3183.03
it's

3179.98 --> 3183.03
[Music]

3184.0 --> 3189.0
yours yeah if you share your

3186.96 --> 3192.0
Consciousness you know what that is

3189.0 --> 3192.0
that's called being

3193.799 --> 3198.44
possessed yeah you can share your

3196.319 --> 3201.319
Consciousness you have can have

3198.44 --> 3204.48
something else sit inside of

3201.319 --> 3208.14
you and pull your strings yeah that's

3204.48 --> 3214.32
sharing your that's called being

3208.14 --> 3214.3199999999997
[Music]

3214.599 --> 3220.3590000000004
possessed right but if you mean that

3217.88 --> 3220.359
cats

3220.4 --> 3226.839
can at a high rate like derive

3225.16 --> 3230.0
behavioral

3226.839 --> 3232.5589999999997
patterns from humans and figure out

3230.0 --> 3235.4
humans behavioral patterns and then play

3232.559 --> 3237.96
into them to manipulate them to get more

3235.4 --> 3241.119
what they want yes they're absolute

3237.96 --> 3242.7200000000003
Masters at that cats are Masters at

3241.119 --> 3245.6800000000003
behavioral

3242.72 --> 3246.8799999999997
study it really is true they do they

3245.68 --> 3249.64
have that

3246.88 --> 3251.96
instinct and they know how to use it on

3249.64 --> 3255.04
humans

3251.96 --> 3258.04
too but what they do not do is share a

3255.04 --> 3258.04
Consciousness

3259.559 --> 3263.079
because that would be

3264.079 --> 3270.079
creepy although cats can be possessed

3267.2 --> 3272.52
too and you could argue that you as a

3270.079 --> 3276.079
person could even like astrally project

3272.52 --> 3279.079
and then possess a cat although I doubt

3276.079 --> 3282.079
that's that's a nice thing for the

3279.079 --> 3282.079
cat

3287.799 --> 3294.079
anyway H

3290.92 --> 3297.079
WD mentality what do you

3294.079 --> 3297.079
mean

3304.4 --> 3310.64
I don't know what Mass Consciousness

3306.44 --> 3313.76
really is teret I think wrath is into it

3310.64 --> 3316.4
he brought it to the table and I'm

3313.76 --> 3317.7200000000003
immediately like all my warning signs go

3316.4 --> 3322.319
off it's

3317.72 --> 3324.48
like faulty faulty Foundation completely

3322.319 --> 3327.52
wrong completely misinterpreting what it

3324.48 --> 3327.52
really is how it really

3329.44 --> 3334.7200000000003
works yeah so for example if you say

3332.599 --> 3335.76
Mass Consciousness that's already kind

3334.72 --> 3338.839
of

3335.76 --> 3342.5200000000004
contradictory because Consciousness does

3338.839 --> 3345.839
not Heap up in a mass it does not

3342.52 --> 3350.2
uniform if you are part of a massive

3345.839 --> 3352.48
group and you're acting in lock step

3350.2 --> 3357.2799999999997
that's not a massive Consciousness

3352.48 --> 3357.28
that's literally another part of of

3358.0 --> 3365.119
you those are that's your

3360.599 --> 3369.28
group system your group part it's

3365.119 --> 3371.559
another part of you that can like hook

3369.28 --> 3373.3590000000004
together and then you form a flock it's

3371.559 --> 3376.3190000000004
like your flock

3373.359 --> 3378.48
system your Consciousness is very much

3376.319 --> 3381.72
separate when that happens right but it

3378.48 --> 3384.48
doesn't mean that you have to like

3381.72 --> 3387.24
actively task your Consciousness while

3384.48 --> 3388.799
you do it it but you could you could be

3387.24 --> 3391.24
like Oh I'm going to be part of this

3388.799 --> 3394.68
community just go along with the flow

3391.24 --> 3398.0
but still be very studying while you are

3394.68 --> 3400.24
a part of it I have done those kinds of

3398.0 --> 3401.48
things it has nothing to do with your

3400.24 --> 3406.68
Consciousness

3401.48 --> 3411.0
it's group dynamics it's your flock

3406.68 --> 3413.8799999999997
systems it's different it's not your

3411.0 --> 3417.28
Consciousness it's just a system

3413.88 --> 3421.0
that's on top of it and you can just

3417.28 --> 3424.44
like become part of a group and act like

3421.0 --> 3424.44
that that's not your

3425.24 --> 3433.2799999999997
Consciousness your Consciousness is you

3428.92 --> 3436.839
here like being actively awake thinking

3433.28 --> 3439.44
realizing that you are an

3436.839 --> 3442.319
individual like realizing what is

3439.44 --> 3446.52
happening to you like your Consciousness

3442.319 --> 3448.96
can Point At You remind you of what's

3446.52 --> 3452.24
happening when you are partaking in

3448.96 --> 3455.64
group dynamic actions like when you're

3452.24 --> 3457.9199999999996
being pull along to like act for the

3455.64 --> 3460.839
group you can then still use your

3457.92 --> 3463.48
Consciousness to study what it actually

3460.839 --> 3465.72
is you're doing how it's feeling and to

3463.48 --> 3468.2400000000002
realize like hey this is kind of

3465.72 --> 3470.0
different yeah that's your Consciousness

3468.24 --> 3473.24
which is completely

3470.0 --> 3476.799
separated that can do that separate from

3473.24 --> 3476.799
the group dynamic Behavior

3477.16 --> 3483.92
Behavior unless you're like not very

3481.2 --> 3487.1189999999997
strong with it and then just you just

3483.92 --> 3489.119
like loosen the rins and you just go

3487.119 --> 3492.079
with the flow and then you're not really

3489.119 --> 3495.1600000000003
conscious

3492.079 --> 3498.92
yeah the group

3495.16 --> 3502.0789999999997
dynamic can take you over and you can

3498.92 --> 3504.88
dissolve in it by basically letting your

3502.079 --> 3506.52
Consciousness down by like I'm just not

3504.88 --> 3508.559
going to be self I'm just not going to

3506.52 --> 3510.88
think about how I look that I'm an

3508.559 --> 3512.6800000000003
individual what people think about me

3510.88 --> 3515.559
all those things I'm going to abandon

3512.68 --> 3518.1189999999997
them and just be part of the group and

3515.559 --> 3521.119
whatever impulse happens happens yeah

3518.119 --> 3523.48
well that's then you become truly like a

3521.119 --> 3526.52
flock but you lose your Consciousness in

3523.48 --> 3530.799
the process this happens to like all

3526.52 --> 3533.72
animals which do have limited conscious

3530.799 --> 3535.839
as an individual like tactical they use

3533.72 --> 3541.1189999999997
it

3535.839 --> 3543.0389999999998
social tactical but you can dissolve

3541.119 --> 3544.96
into a group by letting your

3543.039 --> 3549.48
Consciousness

3544.96 --> 3552.52
down mutually aware yeah that's

3549.48 --> 3555.039
cute you know what mutually aware is

3552.52 --> 3557.2
it's two

3555.039 --> 3561.2400000000002
consciousnesses being

3557.2 --> 3563.319
aware not one if it's mutual it's not

3561.24 --> 3567.2799999999997
one

3563.319 --> 3571.48
mutual the of the word

3567.28 --> 3571.48
specifically requires more than

3578.0 --> 3585.559
one mono I that's weird

3583.599 --> 3588.2000000000003
ter all right so I'm going to keep

3585.559 --> 3592.6800000000003
conscious like arguing against what

3588.2 --> 3594.24
you're saying oh poetry oh yes yes yeah

3592.68 --> 3595.52
but Consciousness is definitely a

3594.24 --> 3598.2799999999997
mechanism is

3595.52 --> 3602.799
M and so are the other things and it's

3598.28 --> 3605.52
not one provably not one it's it's like

3602.799 --> 3607.68
it's not literally tangible but within

3605.52 --> 3610.88
the spirit mechanics it's very reliable

3607.68 --> 3613.96
and it is kind of tangible and on this

3610.88 --> 3616.2400000000002
in a spiritual way it is

3613.96 --> 3619.079
tangible that's really a pointless thing

3616.24 --> 3621.4799999999996
to say but I'm trying to communicate

3619.079 --> 3621.48
something

3623.559 --> 3626.559
and

3629.82 --> 3634.44
[Music]

3631.2 --> 3637.3999999999996
I mean the Consciousness is not

3634.44 --> 3639.119
completely mysterious just because we

3637.4 --> 3642.2400000000002
don't understand it doesn't mean that we

3639.119 --> 3642.2400000000002
don't know anything about

3642.4 --> 3647.64
it

3645.079 --> 3651.96
see and the things we do know about it

3647.64 --> 3653.0789999999997
is it's you it's the unique perspective

3651.96 --> 3656.76
of

3653.079 --> 3659.28
you and if if it's one with other things

3656.76 --> 3663.039
then guess what that's not you then

3659.28 --> 3666.88
that's your Consciousness not

3663.039 --> 3666.88
being not being

3667.24 --> 3675.4399999999996
conscious yeah you can't be

3672.079 --> 3677.1600000000003
one with everything and be conscious

3675.44 --> 3680.28
that's the

3677.16 --> 3685.0789999999997
point now you can feel

3680.28 --> 3687.079
connected with the energies of things

3685.079 --> 3688.8390000000004
I feel one with all it's like all

3687.079 --> 3691.799
everything all the energy in the world

3688.839 --> 3694.72
is all connecting to my heart right oh

3691.799 --> 3697.4
sounds hippie dippy that's but it

3694.72 --> 3701.68
is that's something that you can

3697.4 --> 3704.6800000000003
experience has absolutely nothing to do

3701.68 --> 3707.16
with your Consciousness being one with

3704.68 --> 3712.0389999999998
everything else no it's simply your

3707.16 --> 3715.52
Consciousness becoming conscious of how

3712.039 --> 3719.92
other things not you other other things

3715.52 --> 3726.119
connect to you other things you

3719.92 --> 3729.64
Consciousness awareness see not one

3726.119 --> 3734.039
thing you and other

3729.64 --> 3734.0389999999998
things and you can become aware of

3739.64 --> 3745.64
that on the physical plan Consciousness

3742.319 --> 3748.079
seems individual on any PL Consciousness

3745.64 --> 3750.839
seems individual because that is what

3748.079 --> 3750.8390000000004
Consciousness

3751.2 --> 3760.5989999999997
is now that Consciousness can

3754.839 --> 3762.64
be almost identical or like synchronous

3760.599 --> 3763.92
with another Consciousness so let's say

3762.64 --> 3766.279
these fingers here this is a

3763.92 --> 3768.52
Consciousness this is me I'm having an

3766.279 --> 3770.559
idea in a certain moment somebody else

3768.52 --> 3772.839
has exactly the same idea in that same

3770.559 --> 3776.079
moment does that mean we're one

3772.839 --> 3778.72
Consciousness no it just means you're to

3776.079 --> 3781.0
Consciousness and you're synchronizing

3778.72 --> 3783.7599999999998
just like birds in the fight the giant

3781.0 --> 3785.24
flock they all synchronized that kind of

3783.76 --> 3787.3590000000004
keep the same distance so they don't

3785.24 --> 3790.0389999999998
keep bumping into one another yeah

3787.359 --> 3791.799
they're all separate though yeah it's

3790.039 --> 3793.1600000000003
called synchronizing it's something you

3791.799 --> 3795.319
can

3793.16 --> 3798.48
do it can

3795.319 --> 3800.96
happen energy synchronized somebody does

3798.48 --> 3801.799
something in a very specific way then

3800.96 --> 3804.92
that

3801.799 --> 3807.52
changes the energies and will

3804.92 --> 3809.64
give tendency to other people to do it

3807.52 --> 3812.92
the exact same way as well because the

3809.64 --> 3815.16
energies are now inviting you to do it

3812.92 --> 3815.16
that

3817.96 --> 3824.2
way has absolutely nothing to do with

3821.0 --> 3827.079
the Consciousness being one it

3824.2 --> 3830.0789999999997
isn't I'm going to start

3827.079 --> 3836.119
yelling I'm going to start yelling over

3830.079 --> 3839.4
it not one Consciousness not one lie not

3836.119 --> 3843.079
one specifically that not one you mean

3839.4 --> 3845.359
you can unify all things but not the

3843.079 --> 3849.079
Consciousness the entire point of the

3845.359 --> 3853.16
Consciousness is that it is separate

3849.079 --> 3853.1600000000003
that's what makes it a

3854.76 --> 3859.48
Consciousness if you're not separate

3857.2 --> 3865.16
then you don't have

3859.48 --> 3867.88
one you turn it off you let it down

3865.16 --> 3871.72
you chose not to separate

3867.88 --> 3875.0
then and then you're not

3871.72 --> 3880.7599999999998
conscious that's the point you can't

3875.0 --> 3880.76
have it like that it mechanically is

3887.559 --> 3892.1600000000003
illogical

3890.319 --> 3894.279
anagram

3892.16 --> 3897.279
what what are you guys talking about

3894.279 --> 3899.92
loud obviously something

3897.279 --> 3904.279
else don't scream so

3899.92 --> 3904.279
loud it's not that loud come

3905.24 --> 3911.279
on why

3907.4 --> 3914.48
are also sort of electric

3911.279 --> 3915.319
what we are also sort of electric no we

3914.48 --> 3918.72
have

3915.319 --> 3918.72
electricity we have

3923.079 --> 3927.2400000000002
it

3924.599 --> 3930.119
but electricity is not our Consciousness

3927.24 --> 3933.319
electricity is our

3930.119 --> 3936.76
energy it's it's the thing that

3933.319 --> 3938.64
polarizes the spirit it's so it is like

3936.76 --> 3940.7200000000003
connected to our being which is

3938.64 --> 3943.64
connected to our

3940.72 --> 3946.5989999999997
Consciousness but it isn't our

3943.64 --> 3951.7599999999998
Consciousness Consciousness is not to be

3946.599 --> 3951.76
found in other things only within our

3953.079 --> 3958.559
experience

3955.119 --> 3960.559
it's like only something that is

3958.559 --> 3963.92
conscious

3960.559 --> 3967.2400000000002
can prove it's

3963.92 --> 3969.2400000000002
conscious it's a bit

3967.24 --> 3972.799
complicated but yeah that's why there's

3969.24 --> 3972.799
like an tests for

3973.44 --> 3976.639
[Music]

3977.359 --> 3981.799
that look pules no they

3983.0 --> 3986.0
don't

3987.72 --> 3991.0389999999998
senses are electric

3994.16 --> 4001.64
signals maybe correlation not

3998.359 --> 4001.64
causation I'd

4003.039 --> 4008.7990000000004
say because there's another perspective

4005.88 --> 4011.2000000000003
on this and that is that the spirit is

4008.799 --> 4015.0389999999998
actually the real nervous system and the

4011.2 --> 4017.8799999999997
nervous system is merely a like a a

4015.039 --> 4017.88
registry

4017.96 --> 4023.359
system or maybe the batteries for the

4024.279 --> 4029.24
spirit right spear is energy where is it

4026.839 --> 4034.96
getting it

4029.24 --> 4034.9599999999996
from well nerves are like wires

4035.359 --> 4040.839
so but I mean technically the nerves

4038.76 --> 4045.44
like even like touching

4040.839 --> 4047.319
nerves you sense something

4045.44 --> 4050.76
before the

4047.319 --> 4053.359
nerve of that location that felt it can

4050.76 --> 4055.88
actually mechanically communicated

4053.359 --> 4058.319
towards the brain and that's a

4055.88 --> 4060.0
scientific

4058.319 --> 4063.24
fact

4060.0 --> 4064.92
understand do you know that did you know

4063.24 --> 4068.72
that

4064.92 --> 4071.5
like signal transfer through the nervous

4068.72 --> 4072.7599999999998
system is too

4071.5 --> 4075.76
[Music]

4072.76 --> 4078.76
slow which which means they got it all

4075.76 --> 4082.2000000000003
wrong cuz it's not like oh it's a

4078.76 --> 4085.3590000000004
communication oh beep oh oh touch

4082.2 --> 4089.279
something oh touch something touch

4085.359 --> 4092.24
something touch something no

4089.279 --> 4095.0
no touch

4092.24 --> 4096.5199999999995
something yeah you touch something

4095.0 --> 4100.44
that's what's really

4096.52 --> 4103.6
happening it's instant how can you have

4100.44 --> 4107.08
reflexes do incredible things with your

4103.6 --> 4107.08
cont ious and lock step with your

4107.159 --> 4113.3589999999995
body it goes faster than your nervous

4110.56 --> 4116.1990000000005
system okay because the nervous system

4113.359 --> 4118.88
is not the thing that's communicating it

4116.199 --> 4122.599999999999
to your brain your spirit

4118.88 --> 4123.92
is instant instant instant instant

4122.6 --> 4128.08
there's

4123.92 --> 4130.319
no travel time instant it's there it's

4128.08 --> 4134.359
like light it's just there

4130.319 --> 4136.64
bang and then and then

4134.359 --> 4138.759
there's a feedback with the nervous

4136.64 --> 4141.799
system yeah it's

4138.759 --> 4144.56
secondary it's like a jit the nervous

4141.799 --> 4146.239
system is more like a discharge system

4144.56 --> 4149.56
for the

4146.239 --> 4152.959999999999
spirit it's not your internet wire to

4149.56 --> 4155.02
your to your sensories and your muscles

4152.96 --> 4159.63
it's not an internet

4155.02 --> 4159.63
[Music]

4162.719 --> 4167.679
wire

4164.92 --> 4167.679
right it's

4167.92 --> 4173.92
secondary your reflexes are faster than

4171.239 --> 4173.919999999999
your nerve

4174.56 --> 4181.04
speed because it's your spirit that's

4177.4 --> 4184.2789999999995
doing it and then there's a registry

4181.04 --> 4186.92
process which is like helps you know why

4184.279 --> 4190.4800000000005
it helps with muscle training it's like

4186.92 --> 4193.08
you do something then it's registered

4190.48 --> 4195.36
it's it's done that you've done that oh

4193.08 --> 4197.679
why did you do that what do you need for

4195.36 --> 4199.96
that could you adapt to doing that

4197.679 --> 4201.88
better yeah that's what your nerve

4199.96 --> 4205.0
system is really

4201.88 --> 4208.84
for it's to adapt to the things that you

4205.0 --> 4211.08
do instantaneously with your with your

4208.84 --> 4213.1990000000005
Consciousness you make it happen you

4211.08 --> 4215.8
feel something

4213.199 --> 4219.4
immediately and then your nervous system

4215.8 --> 4222.28
registered it to basically help your

4219.4 --> 4225.639999999999
body adapt to it there is no Spirit yes

4222.28 --> 4225.639999999999
there [ __ ] is

4228.56 --> 4235.96
idiot the spirit is literally in your

4232.88 --> 4238.1990000000005
body literally there literally

4235.96 --> 4242.0
connecting yeah you think it's all

4238.199 --> 4247.799999999999
physical wiring no it's nonphysical

4242.0 --> 4250.8
wiring it's Spirit wiring it's energy

4247.8 --> 4254.1990000000005
wiring and it goes very

4250.8 --> 4258.12
quick it stares you on a cellular level

4254.199 --> 4260.678999999999
your spirit stes your cellular processes

4258.12 --> 4264.5199999999995
without your spirit it all

4260.679 --> 4268.12
dies it all decays entropy sets in yeah

4264.52 --> 4271.400000000001
your spirit is the thing that prevents

4268.12 --> 4274.5599999999995
entropy from demolishing your

4271.4 --> 4277.679
body that's literally what that

4274.56 --> 4279.679
is yeah in accordance to rudol Steiner

4277.679 --> 4281.88
mechanisms in accordance to the

4279.679 --> 4285.32
technique that I apply this is exactly

4281.88 --> 4287.159000000001
how it is you can say n there isn't go

4285.32 --> 4290.159
[ __ ] yourself I know what the [ __ ] I'm

4287.159 --> 4293.36
talking about I live this it works like

4290.159 --> 4297.96
this and yeah what I'm talking about is

4293.36 --> 4300.839999999999
true yeah instant you feel it instant

4297.96 --> 4303.44
yeah oh yeah but we dissected it and it

4300.84 --> 4307.360000000001
should take like this yeah yeah but you

4303.44 --> 4309.599999999999
had it instant so it doesn't travel

4307.36 --> 4311.4
through your nerves to get to your brain

4309.6 --> 4314.360000000001
yeah no it's

4311.4 --> 4317.239
instant and this nerve connect contion

4314.36 --> 4319.96
is something

4317.239 --> 4323.5599999999995
else something

4319.96 --> 4326.4
else not the thing not the thing that

4323.56 --> 4329.0
made you conscious it's something

4326.4 --> 4332.638999999999
else it's a secondary thing that's

4329.0 --> 4334.679
happening there not the thing that made

4332.639 --> 4337.679
you detect what you

4334.679 --> 4337.679
felt

4342.48 --> 4345.48
yeah

4373.199 --> 4379.0
so I'm going to put this in title and I

4376.56 --> 4382.639
got a title and we'll

4379.0 --> 4382.639
see it's true

4384.88 --> 4390.2390000000005
though this topic gets AR what the [ __ ]

4387.56 --> 4392.4400000000005
are you whining about this is just what

4390.239 --> 4392.44
it

4394.239 --> 4399.32
is they going to take your soul they can

4397.6 --> 4401.84
take all those things like I'm not

4399.32 --> 4405.32
formatting this in a Christian sense

4401.84 --> 4409.52
guys when I talk about Spirit Soul I'm

4405.32 --> 4411.239
not talking about your biblical hor [ __ ]

4409.52 --> 4414.88
yeah I'm not talking about something

4411.239 --> 4414.879999999999
that you can sell to an

4415.52 --> 4422.4800000000005
entity I'm talking about the very

4419.76 --> 4425.2390000000005
substances that you in your spiritual

4422.48 --> 4429.0
form are comprised of that actually

4425.239 --> 4431.599999999999
interface with this TR Throne of

4429.0 --> 4435.08
Flesh that you

4431.6 --> 4437.56
have yeah your energy

4435.08 --> 4441.32
counterpart with your Consciousness at

4437.56 --> 4443.639
the center interfacing with this Throne

4441.32 --> 4445.88
of dirt

4443.639 --> 4448.4800000000005
dust

4445.88 --> 4449.52
flesh how that works Rudolph Steiner

4448.48 --> 4453.48
worked it

4449.52 --> 4456.76
out and he got it and he got it

4453.48 --> 4460.759999999999
right and he made systems with it on how

4456.76 --> 4463.92
to do things how to fix things like

4460.76 --> 4465.320000000001
magically fix them

4463.92 --> 4468.4800000000005
way

4465.32 --> 4471.12
past like any [ __ ] movie could ever

4468.48 --> 4471.12
make up

4471.239 --> 4474.48
yeah it

4476.96 --> 4483.92
[Music]

4480.679 --> 4485.719
works Don't Force It [ __ ] you dude I'm

4483.92 --> 4487.52
not forcing anything I'm just telling

4485.719 --> 4490.639
you how it

4487.52 --> 4494.1900000000005
works how I understand it how I lived it

4490.639 --> 4495.4400000000005
how I used it how I tested

4494.19 --> 4499.48
[Music]

4495.44 --> 4502.32
it and how I've come to understand it

4499.48 --> 4504.919999999999
yeah nothing inconsistent about this

4502.32 --> 4507.719
I've talked about this very subject

4504.92 --> 4510.679
since the beginning of my

4507.719 --> 4514.84
channel I'm not forcing my ideas on

4510.679 --> 4516.56
anybody I'm simply elucidating you about

4514.84 --> 4519.679
something that

4516.56 --> 4521.8
works it's but it's all different yeah

4519.679 --> 4525.88
yeah it is all different because that

4521.8 --> 4529.1990000000005
thing you thought was normal

4525.88 --> 4531.92
sucks right everybody knows that

4529.199 --> 4536.32
thing if if everybody knows it well

4531.92 --> 4538.28
guess what big chance it sucks because a

4536.32 --> 4539.96
lot of things suck especially things

4538.28 --> 4542.679
that everybody just

4539.96 --> 4544.84
starts leaning on when they don't

4542.679 --> 4546.36
understand it yeah those things end up

4544.84 --> 4549.719
sucking a

4546.36 --> 4551.92
lot like ridiculous Notions that your

4549.719 --> 4553.6
your Consciousness is one with all

4551.92 --> 4557.04
Consciousness no it isn't that's

4553.6 --> 4559.639
specifically what it is it now you as an

4557.04 --> 4561.639
entity that's one thing right like what

4559.639 --> 4563.2390000000005
happens with you as an entity after

4561.639 --> 4564.679
death and this you can argue all kinds

4563.239 --> 4567.759999999999
of things with

4564.679 --> 4568.92
that but what you cannot argue is what

4567.76 --> 4571.400000000001
what

4568.92 --> 4573.719
defines

4571.4 --> 4575.96
Consciousness and then

4573.719 --> 4579.44
logically

4575.96 --> 4582.12
realize that it is separate and that is

4579.44 --> 4585.12
what is what makes it a

4582.12 --> 4585.12
consciousness

4585.48 --> 4591.44
and that well if it's not separate then

4588.36 --> 4594.88
it's not a conscious then it's something

4591.44 --> 4601.239
else oh you got

4594.88 --> 4601.2390000000005
in white cat got in tricked him

4602.84 --> 4608.4800000000005
somewh I'm not okay well whatever

4612.08 --> 4615.08
man

4616.48 --> 4619.799999999999
I don't really care I don't care if you

4618.4 --> 4623.5199999999995
don't like

4619.8 --> 4626.159000000001
it I'm going to keep reiterating it and

4623.52 --> 4628.040000000001
I'll be more aggressive about it if you

4626.159 --> 4629.32
think that pushing back like this is

4628.04 --> 4633.4
going to make me

4629.32 --> 4635.44
stop yeah how many times have I brought

4633.4 --> 4638.5599999999995
something to the table and somebody else

4635.44 --> 4640.44
thought this is not good how many times

4638.56 --> 4643.070000000001
did they

4640.44 --> 4646.12
succeed in making me stop

4643.07 --> 4646.12
[Music]

4648.6 --> 4654.92

4682.639 --> 4690.12

for no explicable reason why you object

4690.12 --> 4696.679
for what well doesn't say just object

4695.04 --> 4697.48
not for a good reason that's fine you

4697.48 --> 4703.04
object not for a good reason just if you

4700.6 --> 4705.88
don't have a good reason don't expect me

4703.04 --> 4707.719
need to like actually care about that

4705.88 --> 4710.33

Luke Kramer thank you very much you

4917.56 --> 4926.4800000000005
agree we have the Ultron arcade game

4921.32 --> 4928.92
wow like a real original one that's

4926.48 --> 4931.839999999999
amazing I mean it's still kind of really

4928.92 --> 4934.4
old the game but to just have that is

4931.84 --> 4934.400000000001
pretty damn

4934.76 --> 4939.76
cool unless you move around a lot and

4937.239 --> 4942.04
then you have to like get that giant box

4939.76 --> 4943.280000000001
for a super outdated game moving it with

4942.04 --> 4947.4
you all the time

4943.28 --> 4951.4
time oh emulator said oh okay I thought

4947.4 --> 4953.96
you had the actual arcade box and

4951.4 --> 4956.599999999999
everything wish you had the original

4953.96 --> 4959.28
well if you can afford it I mean there's

4956.6 --> 4961.96
people that literally make those like

4959.28 --> 4963.639
remake from scratch those types of

4961.96 --> 4965.88
arcade

4963.639 --> 4967.76
boxes anyway I'm going to round out the

4965.88 --> 4971.84
show Nathan's already started up the

so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

4982.96 --> 4989.159
like this show it's a bit weird but uh

4986.92 --> 4991.28
interesting though especially a part

4989.159 --> 4993.96
with the Consciousness I mean that I

4991.28 --> 4995.639
have a really good point there it's very

4993.96 --> 4998.4800000000005
like that's a real point it's not just

4995.639 --> 5002.639
me being oh Arwin has to be different no

4998.48 --> 5004.08
no no this is this a reason out point

5002.639 --> 5007.0
but it doesn't mean that you will have

5004.08 --> 5010.08
to accept that right away or anything

5007.0 --> 5012.96
right but hopefully over time you will

5010.08 --> 5014.88
realize why I made such a point out of

5012.96 --> 5017.28
it

5014.88 --> 5019.56
