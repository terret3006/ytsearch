the sun is out it's quite a remarkable

92.159 --> 95.43900000000001
day

93.52 --> 97.28
because there's still the snow out there

95.439 --> 99.27999999999999
a lot of it

97.28 --> 101.04
and it's still cold outside but there is

99.28 --> 103.2
this beautiful sun

101.04 --> 104.72000000000001
it's been shining all morning and just

103.2 --> 106.479
super bright

104.72 --> 108.32
all that sunlight reflecting off the

106.479 --> 111.6
snow

108.32 --> 111.6
it was really intense

113.28 --> 117.43900000000001
like inside where there's a mirror in

115.6 --> 118.88
the bathroom with that light over there

117.439 --> 122.24
like i can barely see

118.88 --> 123.19999999999999
anything in the bathroom light because

122.24 --> 125.6
of just

123.2 --> 128.239
being used to a heavy light from the

125.6 --> 131.28
outside i could barely see anything

128.239 --> 134.31900000000002
well yeah it's good

131.28 --> 143.84
i like it when it's that bright so

134.319 --> 143.83999999999997
quite a beautiful day

148.64 --> 151.51999999999998
right so

153.04 --> 159.76
hello dank first in chat good to see you

156.64 --> 162.64
good morning got

159.76 --> 162.64
green tea with me

165.76 --> 171.84
hey ajam

182.84 --> 185.84
um

188.64 --> 191.35999999999999
ah so

191.76 --> 195.04
yeah it's really nice

195.12 --> 198.64000000000001
i feel good it's really good to have the

197.519 --> 201.44
sun

198.64 --> 201.44
shining again

210.08 --> 216.0
yesterday was a day that fared a lot

212.64 --> 216.0
better than the day before

225.36 --> 229.36
i made a lot of notes and i'm filling up

227.44 --> 233.35999999999999
those notes

229.36 --> 238.48000000000002
now because i was pretty

233.36 --> 238.48000000000002
late pretty i was up until pretty late

238.84 --> 241.84
ah

244.0 --> 250.239
anyway yeah yesterday flutter

247.04 --> 251.84
early birds was pretty decent flatters

250.239 --> 253.92000000000002
debate i

251.84 --> 254.879
it's kind of silly because i wasn't

253.92 --> 257.44
there at all

254.879 --> 258.71999999999997
i think i say it said hello during the

257.44 --> 261.519
live show and that's it

258.72 --> 262.56
like once because i didn't really get

261.519 --> 264.8
involved

262.56 --> 266.56
a lot with the rest they were just doing

264.8 --> 268.88
their thing

266.56 --> 269.759
and then i went out for groceries but

268.88 --> 272.8
walking and

269.759 --> 273.68
yeah that takes a lot longer than going

272.8 --> 276.639
by bike

273.68 --> 278.479
so when i got back yeah even the after

276.639 --> 283.84000000000003
show was over so but i i

278.479 --> 286.96
hang around in the uh just in the panel

283.84 --> 289.67999999999995
and yeah talk with brian and chocolate

286.96 --> 290.96
and and meekin i think he was there

289.68 --> 293.52
right

290.96 --> 295.44
the sleeping warrior was there yeah so i

293.52 --> 296.0
still had a good talk afterwards but i

295.44 --> 299.199
didn't see

296.0 --> 302.32
the show because yeah went out

299.199 --> 302.32
and it took a long time

302.56 --> 306.8
it's like it takes at least one and a

304.4 --> 310.15999999999997
half hour this way

306.8 --> 313.6
instead of was it a 30

310.16 --> 316.08000000000004
40 50 minutes that normally

313.6 --> 319.199
going my bike does although i think i'm

316.08 --> 323.12
probably today gonna try going by bike

319.199 --> 325.759
again because at least the roads

323.12 --> 328.24
seem to be cleared of ice now thanks for

325.759 --> 328.24
the sun

329.44 --> 336.56
uh right anyway yeah after that

333.28 --> 338.15999999999997
i watched some alex jones to get

336.56 --> 341.28000000000003
informed what's going down

338.16 --> 345.36
out there uh

341.28 --> 347.59999999999997
oh yeah oh i had a call from my healer

345.36 --> 350.84000000000003
finally

347.6 --> 353.84000000000003
because he's been very busy

350.84 --> 355.67999999999995
uh but i had called him like the day

353.84 --> 358.96
before because of like stress

355.68 --> 360.0
situations and all that things going

358.96 --> 361.919
wrong

360.0 --> 366.8
so i got a healing and that was very

361.919 --> 370.96
good like i really needed that

366.8 --> 370.96000000000004
and so again i feel very strong now

371.68 --> 378.96
that much more stable which is great

375.039 --> 378.96
yeah and the sun helps a lot too

379.12 --> 382.319
and then after that

382.88 --> 386.479
i had yeah my friend from neymar called

385.68 --> 389.36
me again

386.479 --> 390.71999999999997
a very long conversation man it was up

389.36 --> 395.199
until

390.72 --> 398.8
half past one at night

395.199 --> 398.8
but yeah she really needed it

399.28 --> 404.71999999999997
and i am here for her and as long as i

401.84 --> 409.599
wasn't keeping anybody else up

404.72 --> 412.319
that's just fine

409.599 --> 412.319
hello zach

413.52 --> 417.68
be careful yeah i am careful

418.16 --> 422.16
when i call my my friend i'm not gonna

419.919 --> 425.919
get super angry or anything that's

422.16 --> 425.91900000000004
that can that doesn't ever happen

426.96 --> 431.599
but if we're like having too much fun i

428.96 --> 433.599
might yeah keep somebody else awake but

431.599 --> 436.88
they were still up so i wasn't getting

433.599 --> 439.52
in their way

436.88 --> 441.759
be careful on that bike oh yeah yeah i

439.52 --> 441.75899999999996
will

442.96 --> 446.479
yeah and besides like if it doesn't

444.8 --> 448.639
really work out if it's too much of a

446.479 --> 450.96
hassle i'll just go and walk the rest of

448.639 --> 454.639
the way

450.96 --> 456.08
you know the walking with the bike

454.639 --> 459.599
doesn't necessarily take

456.08 --> 465.84
longer than just walking well anyway

459.599 --> 465.84
we'll see what i'm gonna do out there

467.68 --> 473.52
yeah one bit of a minus point

471.039 --> 476.24
it's just detail like one of the

473.52 --> 479.35999999999996
roommates is moving out

476.24 --> 479.84000000000003
i can't say that i'm really gonna miss

479.36 --> 481.68
them

479.84 --> 483.919
because i think that they were very

481.68 --> 486.40000000000003
snitchy towards my landlord

483.919 --> 486.96
about everything and that's that was

486.4 --> 491.28
very

486.96 --> 494.87899999999996
inconvenient like that uh

491.28 --> 496.08
the new roommate so it happens to be

494.879 --> 498.08000000000004
here right now

496.08 --> 500.71999999999997
just checking it out and pretty cool

498.08 --> 500.71999999999997
guys so

501.84 --> 508.31899999999996
i think that's gonna be better

506.16 --> 509.759
but yeah the old roommate guy is taking

508.319 --> 514.159
away the oven

509.759 --> 516.24
the oven for my buns damn it

514.159 --> 518.0
so i'm going to be in an oven-less

516.24 --> 519.919
situation again

518.0 --> 521.519
i'll survive but it is kind of a

519.919 --> 524.64
nuisance

521.519 --> 527.92
so maybe i'll get together and figure

524.64 --> 527.92
out how to get a new oven

528.8 --> 535.8389999999999
no car no bike walk everywhere all right

535.92 --> 539.92
yeah why not if you like it if you got

537.839 --> 542.8800000000001
the time

539.92 --> 545.4399999999999
i don't mind walking i actually enjoyed

542.88 --> 545.4399999999999
the walks

546.08 --> 551.44
and besides yeah yesterday

549.279 --> 552.88
i do enjoy the walk but with when it's

551.44 --> 553.2
this cold it does seem to be a little

552.88 --> 556.64
bit

553.2 --> 556.6400000000001
hassle for my bladder

556.959 --> 562.7199999999999
but yesterday i will manage to be able

560.839 --> 565.519
to

562.72 --> 567.0400000000001
take a leak in the grocery store in

565.519 --> 571.12
their toilet by the way

567.04 --> 573.279
after asking so i that way prevented the

571.12 --> 574.5600000000001
similar situation from happening as the

573.279 --> 577.8389999999999
day before

574.56 --> 577.8389999999999
very thankful for that

579.279 --> 583.6
and uh yeah we'll see what happens today

585.839 --> 590.32
right so after the telephone call i

588.16 --> 594.64
still watched a bit of lift the veil

590.32 --> 597.6
it's very interesting to keep track of

594.64 --> 599.68
in the recent days and heard there that

597.6 --> 602.88
apparently elon musk

599.68 --> 607.3599999999999
bought 10 billion dollars

602.88 --> 610.079
worth of bitcoin that's crazy stuff

607.36 --> 612.32
it's like a pretty radical shift like

610.079 --> 612.3199999999999
that

612.56 --> 615.92
so for those that hadn't taken notice of

615.44 --> 619.839
that

615.92 --> 619.8389999999999
that happened apparently yesterday too

620.88 --> 632.079
ah right and that's pretty much it

625.04 --> 634.079
for what i was doing

632.079 --> 636.88
oh wait yeah i think yeah i watched the

634.079 --> 636.88
matrix too

638.16 --> 643.8389999999999
yeah now wait i did that yesterday

641.36 --> 643.839
didn't i

645.44 --> 649.2790000000001
right i'm in a bit of a confusion

648.24 --> 652.24
because i pretty much

649.279 --> 654.32
laid out yesterday's day to my friend

652.24 --> 656.0790000000001
over the phone so now it feels like it's

654.32 --> 657.839
an extra day ago because i already

656.079 --> 660.2399999999999
talked about it in a very similar

657.839 --> 663.9200000000001
fashion as i would on my show

660.24 --> 675.839
it's waiting me out but yeah that was

663.92 --> 675.8389999999999
all yesterday

676.8 --> 681.12
yeah also it was good to

681.76 --> 685.68
like the talk with my healer was very

683.6 --> 688.64
helpful because then

685.68 --> 689.12
i can really size up if my reaction is

688.64 --> 692.24
like

689.12 --> 693.76
overboard or not in in face of what is

692.24 --> 697.6
happening out there in the world

693.76 --> 700.079
but even my healer like

697.6 --> 702.24
he would come to me about like the

700.079 --> 705.92
issues in the world so he is very much

702.24 --> 708.9590000000001
on top of the yeah the

705.92 --> 712.399
corona situation what it isn't

708.959 --> 715.1999999999999
you know hey i got part of that

712.399 --> 716.16
from him like the virus is not really

715.2 --> 718.48
really

716.16 --> 719.279
being infectious and all that but being

718.48 --> 722.399
an inherent

719.279 --> 727.76
immune system part like

722.399 --> 727.76
yeah i got that mostly through him

728.8 --> 733.68
and it was just interesting to hear that

732.0 --> 736.399
despite all that knowledge it doesn't

733.68 --> 739.3599999999999
prevent you from kind of

736.399 --> 740.639
being burdened up by it from the outside

739.36 --> 745.839
world

740.639 --> 745.839
yes healer yes that's right

750.24 --> 754.0790000000001
yeah i call him my healer i'm not gonna

752.0 --> 757.68
name him by name

754.079 --> 760.959
but he's a lifelong experienced person

757.68 --> 764.959
my dad trusted him

760.959 --> 769.8389999999999
like years ago i went to him shaman

764.959 --> 769.8389999999999
uh no not really not like that

771.6 --> 777.12
it's it's complicated he's like a

781.36 --> 786.639
it is complicated it's just it's a

784.839 --> 788.8800000000001
healer

786.639 --> 789.6800000000001
that is a lot of what he does and the

788.88 --> 793.36
way he does it

789.68 --> 793.3599999999999
is through kind of like

794.079 --> 800.8
very similar to what i do except he

797.6 --> 804.5600000000001
uses it his analytical skills and his

800.8 --> 808.8
visualization skills to basically

804.56 --> 811.04
do it like that it's look dude

808.8 --> 813.76
to me it's still kind of a miracle that

811.04 --> 816.0
he can even do it the way he does

813.76 --> 819.279
magical powers from the devil

816.0 --> 821.6
no no no no no he calls upon

819.279 --> 824.0
christ every single time and he even

821.6 --> 828.0790000000001
like pushes that towards me

824.0 --> 830.88
right so no not powers from the devil

828.079 --> 831.8389999999999
yeah healing just healing the same way i

830.88 --> 834.959
can

831.839 --> 837.44
do minor things like that

834.959 --> 839.279
i just don't focus a lot on it i'm a lot

837.44 --> 843.839
more preoccupied with

839.279 --> 843.8389999999999
the mind

844.88 --> 848.16
and rather what is it the damage

847.199 --> 850.56
prevention

848.16 --> 853.4399999999999
hopefully i don't know i might trigger a

850.56 --> 853.4399999999999
lot of people too

854.56 --> 857.8389999999999
because of the subjects

865.279 --> 875.119
all right but yeah i feel great today

871.33 --> 875.119
[Music]

876.32 --> 878.639
ah

882.8 --> 889.8389999999999
so is anybody gonna say something

886.399 --> 889.839
yes ordinary bear

890.079 --> 895.5999999999999
amazing synchronicities recently okay

893.04 --> 899.8389999999999
good to hear

895.6 --> 899.839
what about

903.839 --> 907.7600000000001
do you still think you love to be 200

906.0 --> 910.24
years old well that depends on how

907.76 --> 914.24
things are going to unroll

910.24 --> 914.24
you know if the world is good then sure

914.88 --> 919.4399999999999
but if this nonsense is like going to

917.36 --> 922.639
increase and get worse

919.44 --> 924.32
only and never going to stop not even in

922.639 --> 928.16
200 years

924.32 --> 931.839
then probably getting being 200 years

928.16 --> 931.8389999999999
is going to be a major challenge

932.0 --> 936.72
corona gonna catch you corona doesn't

934.24 --> 936.72
exist

938.0 --> 941.68
there's no virus that's going to catch

940.88 --> 943.759
me

941.68 --> 945.12
because the virus is already inside

943.759 --> 948.24
everybody

945.12 --> 951.92
it's a natural part of your system

948.24 --> 955.279
a microbiological scale

951.92 --> 958.3199999999999
but yeah it can be it can get out

955.279 --> 959.759
in a response psychosomatically and then

958.32 --> 961.9200000000001
yeah you get a cold you

959.759 --> 963.36
you get sick because your body's

961.92 --> 966.399
cleaning up

963.36 --> 968.9590000000001
whatever you've built up

966.399 --> 970.0
in toxins in your body in a very

968.959 --> 973.279
specific

970.0 --> 976.079
type of cell on a cellular level that

973.279 --> 977.92
your body normally cannot eject this

976.079 --> 981.519
type of toxin

977.92 --> 982.399
but the viruses the cleanup crew the

981.519 --> 983.92
robots

982.399 --> 986.959
inside of your body that will be

983.92 --> 990.0
summoned when you get sick like that

986.959 --> 990.399
they actually do clean it up and that's

990.0 --> 994.24
why

990.399 --> 997.199
people that get sick very usually

994.24 --> 999.6800000000001
very likely end up after they get better

997.199 --> 1002.7199999999999
feeling better than they did before

999.68 --> 1003.92
they got sick because that is what it is

1002.72 --> 1006.9590000000001
for

1003.92 --> 1006.959
i'm not afraid of it

1008.72 --> 1012.639
yes viruses are part of the immune

1011.04 --> 1016.0
system sort of

1012.639 --> 1018.0790000000001
well there the viruses don't spend time

1016.0 --> 1020.8
attacking things like bacteria which

1018.079 --> 1024.1599999999999
yeah bacteria can

1020.8 --> 1027.28
actually be considered some of them

1024.16 --> 1028.88
in certain circumstances as in invasive

1027.28 --> 1031.36
thing right right they can

1028.88 --> 1033.2800000000002
self-procreate they feed off

1031.36 --> 1036.9589999999998
viruses are a part of your system but

1033.28 --> 1042.48
it's not even the immune system it is

1036.959 --> 1045.6000000000001
cleanup crew that's what it does really

1042.48 --> 1045.919
so if you get yourself poisoned you'll

1045.6 --> 1049.52
get

1045.919 --> 1052.0800000000002
sick or you could get sick afterwards

1049.52 --> 1053.84
because your body is trying to clean up

1052.08 --> 1056.08
the mess

1053.84 --> 1056.08
see

1061.76 --> 1067.84
hey julia pepin and navy tax

1064.84 --> 1067.84
37

1069.52 --> 1081.84
a real joe

1092.72 --> 1098.4
what about t cells what is that

1096.08 --> 1099.28
what is that again i don't remember what

1098.4 --> 1101.679
is it again t

1099.28 --> 1101.6789999999999
cells

1102.48 --> 1105.599
[Music]

1107.679 --> 1111.76
oh yeah yeah blind white blood cells

1118.16 --> 1123.8400000000001
yet i think that t cells are really for

1120.96 --> 1123.8400000000001
bacteria

1123.919 --> 1128.0800000000002
because that does exist bacteria do

1126.72 --> 1132.48
exist

1128.08 --> 1132.48
like in in that sense i even believe

1133.52 --> 1137.679
germ theory it's i think it's

1135.6 --> 1139.039
scientifically proven it's been tested

1137.679 --> 1142.24
demonstrated

1139.039 --> 1142.96
it's just that this virus thing this

1142.24 --> 1146.559
micro

1142.96 --> 1149.1200000000001
thing which it's made into a micro

1146.559 --> 1150.32
bacteria that's what they portray

1149.12 --> 1153.36
viruses to be

1150.32 --> 1154.24
well they're not right and it doesn't

1153.36 --> 1157.28
mean that

1154.24 --> 1158.0
diseases associated with viruses are not

1157.28 --> 1160.799
diseases

1158.0 --> 1160.799
it just means

1162.08 --> 1167.36
what is suggested of what is going on

1165.36 --> 1170.9599999999998
doesn't really happen like that

1167.36 --> 1173.28
so they're basically blaming viruses

1170.96 --> 1174.32
for something when it's very likely that

1173.28 --> 1176.32
the viruses are just

1174.32 --> 1177.52
a side effect and maybe they can't

1176.32 --> 1181.28
explain it

1177.52 --> 1182.32
you know maybe their understanding of

1181.28 --> 1184.48
biology just

1182.32 --> 1185.9189999999999
can't really explain it through that

1184.48 --> 1188.24
system as to

1185.919 --> 1193.3600000000001
why certain types of diseases that are

1188.24 --> 1195.1200000000001
associated with viruses

1193.36 --> 1197.6
and in that sense yeah the medical

1195.12 --> 1200.08
system is not

1197.6 --> 1202.7199999999998
not complete it there's a lot of things

1200.08 --> 1204.8799999999999
that they're basically just

1202.72 --> 1206.72
they just have a theory about it and

1204.88 --> 1210.3200000000002
they try certain things

1206.72 --> 1210.72
but the theory doesn't have to actually

1210.32 --> 1214.48
be

1210.72 --> 1215.84
real sounds kind of like astrophysics

1214.48 --> 1218.0
that way sometimes

1215.84 --> 1220.08
so they just go by treatments and but

1218.0 --> 1221.919
yeah if you go by a model that's not

1220.08 --> 1223.28
actually real then you might have some

1221.919 --> 1224.48
treatments but because you don't

1223.28 --> 1226.559
understand it

1224.48 --> 1227.6
because you got the wrong model of

1226.559 --> 1229.52
what's going on

1227.6 --> 1232.0
it there's much more likelihood that

1229.52 --> 1234.96
things will go wrong

1232.0 --> 1237.679
because they're not sizing the situation

1234.96 --> 1240.72
up for what it really is

1237.679 --> 1244.0
right person may definitely be ill

1240.72 --> 1248.72
and then a virus idea but is that

1244.0 --> 1251.84
the invasion thing no

1248.72 --> 1251.84
it's the reaction

1255.679 --> 1258.0
right

1258.72 --> 1262.559
they think everything then no now they

1261.84 --> 1264.72
just use

1262.559 --> 1266.8799999999999
models that are heavily outdated and

1264.72 --> 1270.4
unproven

1266.88 --> 1273.679
the people that do most of that

1270.4 --> 1276.88
just believe in it right they're not

1273.679 --> 1279.3600000000001
faking it they're just going by a broken

1276.88 --> 1281.7600000000002
model and nobody's correcting it

1279.36 --> 1284.08
or well people are trying to correct it

1281.76 --> 1288.84
but it's not being accepted

1284.08 --> 1291.84
like in the official in the official

1288.84 --> 1291.84
objectives

1298.48 --> 1301.84
but yeah you could suggest that the

1300.72 --> 1305.28
people

1301.84 --> 1305.76
that decide on the medical standards as

1305.28 --> 1308.32
it were

1305.76 --> 1310.799
so it's probably going to be boards or

1308.32 --> 1310.799
something

1312.24 --> 1317.28
those people should absolutely know

1315.52 --> 1320.1589999999999
better

1317.28 --> 1320.559
so if anybody is lying then it's those

1320.159 --> 1324.0800000000002
that

1320.559 --> 1328.96
keep the models in place

1324.08 --> 1332.0
and help contribute to suppressing

1328.96 --> 1335.28
alternatives those people could be

1332.0 --> 1338.559
considered to be actually nefarious but

1335.28 --> 1341.28
most of the doctors and and all that

1338.559 --> 1341.76
that work with it they don't really have

1341.28 --> 1344.32
to

1341.76 --> 1345.76
know they might not even have time in

1344.32 --> 1347.6
their life

1345.76 --> 1349.28
to find out because they're just too

1347.6 --> 1349.9189999999999
busy and they just go with what they've

1349.28 --> 1355.44
learned

1349.919 --> 1355.44
they trust it right you gotta realize

1358.84 --> 1364.24
that

1361.28 --> 1366.6399999999999
and it's very difficult to then learn

1364.24 --> 1369.28
about these alternatives

1366.64 --> 1371.2800000000002
and still stay in the medical system

1369.28 --> 1373.12
because if you're going to go against it

1371.28 --> 1376.1589999999999
where you see there's flaws

1373.12 --> 1379.36
based on another model yeah

1376.159 --> 1381.0390000000002
the the system the board

1379.36 --> 1383.039
the rules of the board that have been

1381.039 --> 1386.24
carried out

1383.039 --> 1389.84
they will work against you then

1386.24 --> 1393.039
so it's tough it's tough

1389.84 --> 1395.4399999999998
as a medical profession to really be

1393.039 --> 1396.48
in the know because the system they work

1395.44 --> 1403.8400000000001
with

1396.48 --> 1403.84
will start to work against them

1409.76 --> 1413.679
all right hey nathan oakley good to see

1414.84 --> 1417.84
you

1421.039 --> 1423.36
ah

1434.72 --> 1441.279
yeah i want to shout out to nathan

1438.159 --> 1443.2
like i don't know how he does it on a

1441.279 --> 1445.679
daily basis

1443.2 --> 1446.32
deal with ballers on that energy level i

1445.679 --> 1449.3600000000001
don't know

1446.32 --> 1453.36
where you're getting it from nathan i

1449.36 --> 1453.36
would get so tired out from that

1456.559 --> 1463.039
but you're really dedicated to teaching

1459.919 --> 1465.679
the dumbest of them and it's really

1463.039 --> 1465.679
remarkable

1469.44 --> 1476.24
second nature now yeah yeah it must be

1473.2 --> 1476.24
i i bet that

1476.32 --> 1481.52
like it can be a little it must be

1478.72 --> 1484.799
sometimes a little bit troublesome

1481.52 --> 1485.2
when you for example notice that i don't

1484.799 --> 1487.9189999999999
know

1485.2 --> 1488.799
somebody important or yeah i don't know

1487.919 --> 1491.919
somebody

1488.799 --> 1494.8799999999999
you don't have complete freedom from

1491.919 --> 1496.72
starts blabbering on about the ball and

1494.88 --> 1498.64
you just want to correct them

1496.72 --> 1500.4
as you would normally well if you're

1498.64 --> 1502.48
gonna do that like that they're probably

1500.4 --> 1504.64
gonna get very pissed off

1502.48 --> 1506.24
right but you you probably have that

1504.64 --> 1508.3200000000002
tendency now

1506.24 --> 1511.039
so you have to hold it back a little i

1508.32 --> 1511.039
can't imagine

1513.36 --> 1516.9599999999998
because it is second nature now

1517.2 --> 1519.919
but then again

1520.799 --> 1525.2
you do manage to really keep apart

1524.32 --> 1527.6
normal

1525.2 --> 1529.76
misconception and misunderstanding away

1527.6 --> 1532.24
from zealot doubling down

1529.76 --> 1532.799
behavior so maybe it is not as much a

1532.24 --> 1536.48
problem

1532.799 --> 1538.24
as i would imagine maybe if a zealot

1536.48 --> 1539.039
bumps into you and they're just some

1538.24 --> 1541.2
random guy

1539.039 --> 1543.679
and they won't let go you you would be

1541.2 --> 1545.279
able to do it face to face

1543.679 --> 1548.159
because you would know like they are

1545.279 --> 1548.159
really a zealot

1551.84 --> 1554.9299999999998
[Music]

1555.679 --> 1560.24
right you focus your energy on the show

1566.159 --> 1574.88
whoa i am the cornerstone really nathan

1570.48 --> 1581.2
wow i am honored and a little scared

1574.88 --> 1581.2
no it's fine but i'm very glad that i

1582.48 --> 1588.0
yeah that that you think so i'm honored

1585.12 --> 1588.0
and i hope to

1588.08 --> 1600.62
continue that

1598.64 --> 1603.8000000000002
right

1600.62 --> 1603.8
[Music]

1607.26 --> 1611.279
[Music]

1609.52 --> 1612.72
right well you certainly have been a

1611.279 --> 1615.76
cornerstone for me too

1612.72 --> 1619.6000000000001
by the way nathan because

1615.76 --> 1621.52
that you do it on that level out there

1619.6 --> 1622.7199999999998
every weekdays like that and with the

1621.52 --> 1625.44
after with the

1622.72 --> 1628.159
premieres it's really good that that's

1625.44 --> 1628.159
around because

1628.4 --> 1635.6000000000001
it's like it sets the bar

1631.919 --> 1637.44
as it were for the energy

1635.6 --> 1638.7199999999998
of what's going down it's like if the

1637.44 --> 1641.8400000000001
flight of the bait wasn't

1638.72 --> 1641.84
out there then

1644.88 --> 1648.64
i think most flat earthers would now be

1647.679 --> 1652.3200000000002
a lot more like

1648.64 --> 1655.1200000000001
oh like more over careful

1652.32 --> 1656.08
less coming from a confident point

1655.12 --> 1659.12
standpoint

1656.08 --> 1660.24
because what what you've done really has

1659.12 --> 1663.4399999999998
just

1660.24 --> 1666.72
brought a lot of confidence and

1663.44 --> 1667.2
emphasis on yes flat earth has actually

1666.72 --> 1671.76
won

1667.2 --> 1674.799
and all they're doing is is tricking us

1671.76 --> 1677.36
but showing how so that it's not just a

1674.799 --> 1678.8799999999999
feeling of i recognize that that the guy

1677.36 --> 1682.7199999999998
is fooling themselves now you

1678.88 --> 1683.5200000000002
we and you like i do it a lot on your

1682.72 --> 1686.64
show

1683.52 --> 1689.84
point out exactly how that works

1686.64 --> 1690.88
so that you don't just feel it when that

1689.84 --> 1694.399
happens

1690.88 --> 1697.279
you know exactly how it happens

1694.399 --> 1698.799
what's going on inside of them even

1697.279 --> 1700.559
though they're not even conscious about

1698.799 --> 1701.9189999999999
it themselves but just from past

1700.559 --> 1704.24
experiences you can just

1701.919 --> 1705.919
point it out like this is currently

1704.24 --> 1709.76
happening in them and i

1705.919 --> 1710.64
myself can even reflect back very

1709.76 --> 1713.76
eloquently

1710.64 --> 1716.159
as to when i was a baller how i did it

1713.76 --> 1717.44
and i even sometimes now express it into

1716.159 --> 1721.2
an act

1717.44 --> 1724.799
as balwin and what i basically do

1721.2 --> 1727.039
in that case is act myself as how i was

1724.799 --> 1729.52
in the past it's like a simulation of a

1727.039 --> 1732.799
former self

1729.52 --> 1736.08
what i basically do it's weird is i

1732.799 --> 1736.08
unleash certain

1738.159 --> 1742.0800000000002
yeah i was kind of a magical thinker way

1741.679 --> 1744.3200000000002
back

1742.08 --> 1746.0
and i really believed in the energy so

1744.32 --> 1749.039
much i just

1746.0 --> 1750.24
i lost grip a little didn't go psychotic

1749.039 --> 1752.8799999999999
or anything

1750.24 --> 1754.3990000000001
but i would become very dreamy because

1752.88 --> 1758.3990000000001
of it

1754.399 --> 1761.4399999999998
that allows suspense of disbelief more

1758.399 --> 1763.6
and i would just dedicate

1761.44 --> 1765.279
to the ball system in many ways and even

1763.6 --> 1766.399
to the construction of it because i

1765.279 --> 1768.08
could even see

1766.399 --> 1770.7199999999998
like this is something we're all

1768.08 --> 1773.6
building and i didn't realize like we're

1770.72 --> 1773.6000000000001
all building this

1773.679 --> 1778.72
because we believe it has to be

1776.799 --> 1781.84
what we're what we're actually building

1778.72 --> 1781.84
like it's this thing

1782.559 --> 1786.24
that we know is going to be and you

1784.799 --> 1789.6
build towards that

1786.24 --> 1790.159
and i didn't realize what that was i was

1789.6 --> 1792.7199999999998
just

1790.159 --> 1793.7600000000002
very happy i understood it and could do

1792.72 --> 1796.96
something with it

1793.76 --> 1800.48
i didn't even realize back then like

1796.96 --> 1803.039
this is illogical if it was real

1800.48 --> 1805.279
you wouldn't be building towards it you

1803.039 --> 1808.799
would just be

1805.279 --> 1810.32
gathering what you know and how you know

1808.799 --> 1812.399
it and then

1810.32 --> 1813.4399999999998
with that knowledge putting the pieces

1812.399 --> 1816.08
together like in

1813.44 --> 1818.3200000000002
physics for real i didn't understand

1816.08 --> 1818.96
that no it's just like no it has to be a

1818.32 --> 1822.72
ball

1818.96 --> 1825.44
or everything else is wrong that i know

1822.72 --> 1826.24
so you then just think no no what's the

1825.44 --> 1830.159
best way

1826.24 --> 1830.159
to explain how it has to be a ball

1830.88 --> 1835.5200000000002
and that's what the ballers the zealots

1833.679 --> 1838.48
especially are really stuck in

1835.52 --> 1841.76
it's like you know you have to do it or

1838.48 --> 1844.3990000000001
everything else we know is wrong

1841.76 --> 1844.399
it can't be

1849.6 --> 1854.8799999999999
right but anyway very happy

1853.279 --> 1858.559
at the flat of the bates channel and

1854.88 --> 1858.5590000000002
what nathan oakley does on there

1858.64 --> 1866.0800000000002
because in a way it sets the bar

1862.08 --> 1868.24
as to where we as flat earthers can go

1866.08 --> 1869.76
and what we're really dealing with and

1868.24 --> 1871.919
it's good

1869.76 --> 1875.039
it's very good also for a lot of flat

1871.919 --> 1875.039
earthers out there

1875.44 --> 1880.96
that aren't as forward and communicative

1878.799 --> 1883.76
and making flat earth their lives

1880.96 --> 1885.44
right but that still have to deal with

1883.76 --> 1889.6
ballers

1885.44 --> 1890.0
it's good that they have more to reflect

1889.6 --> 1893.4399999999998
on

1890.0 --> 1895.84
and more material to

1893.44 --> 1897.6000000000001
learn how to deal with it without

1895.84 --> 1899.6
necessarily

1897.6 --> 1902.7199999999998
have to having to verbally defend

1899.6 --> 1902.7199999999998
yourself constantly

1903.039 --> 1907.519
if you just know you don't have to

1905.6 --> 1910.559
necessarily

1907.519 --> 1913.039
test somebody out as much and poke them

1910.559 --> 1914.72
about their beliefs and all that you

1913.039 --> 1918.08
just you can just think like

1914.72 --> 1921.1200000000001
yeah this is probably

1918.08 --> 1922.08
where they're at mentally this is what's

1921.12 --> 1925.36
gonna happen

1922.08 --> 1927.12
if i start to get medley with it is it

1925.36 --> 1928.08
really necessary is there something

1927.12 --> 1931.4399999999998
really

1928.08 --> 1933.76
in the moment critical that i need

1931.44 --> 1936.24
to wake them up and potentially trigger

1933.76 --> 1936.24
them for

1936.399 --> 1940.08
like i would for example potentially do

1939.36 --> 1941.9189999999999
that with

1940.08 --> 1944.08
people that i wouldn't know all that

1941.919 --> 1947.2
much if

1944.08 --> 1950.399
if they showed

1947.2 --> 1951.2
like yeah i'm i'm going to invest giants

1950.399 --> 1954.7199999999998
amount of money

1951.2 --> 1954.72
like all my savings into

1955.6 --> 1959.12
yeah into some space project or

1957.519 --> 1962.3990000000001
something

1959.12 --> 1964.9599999999998
you know then i'd be like dude are you

1962.399 --> 1966.8799999999999
like why is that really necessary for

1964.96 --> 1969.279
you like

1966.88 --> 1970.7990000000002
then i would really start to get in

1969.279 --> 1973.6
there and and try to

1970.799 --> 1975.2
dissuade them not necessarily at first

1973.6 --> 1978.9599999999998
saying yeah but it's all fake

1975.2 --> 1978.96
because then they'll just be triggered

1981.519 --> 1983.76
right

1987.84 --> 1991.84
ballers never speak against government

1992.32 --> 1995.519
yet they do have a lot of statist

1994.32 --> 2004.32
tendencies

1995.519 --> 2008.0
that's right

2004.32 --> 2008.0
amen bear de la

2014.48 --> 2019.84
they wear masks while chatting no no i

2017.12 --> 2019.84
doubt that

2022.399 --> 2025.76
i don't know man i think that most

2024.08 --> 2028.8799999999999
ballers

2025.76 --> 2030.08
like the the real ballers the trenches i

2028.88 --> 2033.8400000000001
think that they

2030.08 --> 2033.84
they know it's fake

2035.2 --> 2040.96
because they had they have to have

2038.72 --> 2042.32
skills to defend themselves

2040.96 --> 2044.24
psychologically

2042.32 --> 2046.24
in a flat earth in a debate against the

2044.24 --> 2047.84
flat earther on a trench level

2046.24 --> 2049.359
they have to be informed to a certain

2047.84 --> 2052.48
level and they must have

2049.359 --> 2054.0
caught on that it's actually fake

2052.48 --> 2056.079
and that doesn't mean that they don't

2054.0 --> 2057.839
believe in viruses even necessarily

2056.079 --> 2060.7200000000003
they just know that what is happening

2057.839 --> 2063.2799999999997
out there is fake whether you believe in

2060.72 --> 2066.879
viruses or not

2063.28 --> 2067.76
right now that doesn't mean that they're

2066.879 --> 2070.879
going to then

2067.76 --> 2072.159
say to everybody that it's all fake out

2070.879 --> 2075.04
there

2072.159 --> 2076.7200000000003
but like i i don't believe there's any

2075.04 --> 2080.159
ballers that we deal with that

2076.72 --> 2082.7999999999997
really believe corona measures

2080.159 --> 2083.28
work and then we all need a vaccine that

2082.8 --> 2085.44
they would

2083.28 --> 2088.7200000000003
actually mean that they might say it to

2085.44 --> 2093.2000000000003
troll us to trigger us to be like

2088.72 --> 2093.2
yeah like hahaha

2094.48 --> 2103.839
but i don't see them

2099.119 --> 2103.839
like actually taking the vaccine

2107.839 --> 2113.2
all i the only one that i've come across

2110.88 --> 2115.28
over here on the internet really that

2113.2 --> 2119.1189999999997
said that they're gonna take the vaccine

2115.28 --> 2120.7200000000003
is tiny wumble who sometimes hangs

2119.119 --> 2122.1600000000003
around in my chat he's the only one

2120.72 --> 2124.7999999999997
who's actually said like yeah yeah i'm

2122.16 --> 2127.92
gonna do that

2124.8 --> 2129.6800000000003
not to be shocking or anything but just

2127.92 --> 2132.56
because he genuinely

2129.68 --> 2132.56
was gonna do that

2137.599 --> 2145.839
yes you

2150.64 --> 2154.0
they lie about getting the facts well

2152.64 --> 2155.68
maybe maybe yes

2154.0 --> 2157.68
there is a lot of just going along

2155.68 --> 2159.1189999999997
virtue signaling like yeah we'll do this

2157.68 --> 2160.72
we'll do that

2159.119 --> 2162.6400000000003
they don't plan to take it but they're

2160.72 --> 2164.72
just too afraid to go against

2162.64 --> 2165.839
it to go against an area yeah there's a

2164.72 --> 2173.839
lot of

2165.839 --> 2173.839
narrative cocking going on like that

2176.96 --> 2182.16
but yeah that doesn't mean that there

2178.64 --> 2182.16
that they would actually do it

2182.88 --> 2187.839
or that they would want to like that

2198.839 --> 2203.52
right

2200.16 --> 2206.16
i had a really good sleep this night

2203.52 --> 2208.4
also had a shower before that probably

2206.16 --> 2208.3999999999996
helped

2210.88 --> 2216.0
it's like yeah it's a

2214.4 --> 2218.079
good moment to take a shower when you

2216.0 --> 2219.839
just well when i was just healed because

2218.079 --> 2222.8
then

2219.839 --> 2223.599
yeah i can wash it all out all the

2222.8 --> 2226.6400000000003
remnant

2223.599 --> 2229.28
issues so i i slept

2226.64 --> 2231.7599999999998
really well this night very very well

2229.28 --> 2231.76
rested

2234.32 --> 2238.96
but i am still a bit like oh yeah i

2236.8 --> 2240.5600000000004
might just go lie

2238.96 --> 2257.839
sleep a little more but i'm not gonna do

2240.56 --> 2257.839
it but i do still feel it like

2282.839 --> 2285.839
what

2286.48 --> 2291.119
well tera36 are you serious is that a

2296.839 --> 2313.839
thing

2298.48 --> 2313.839
huh that's funny i didn't know that

2323.839 --> 2330.0789999999997
all right well by that standard tiny one

2326.48 --> 2330.079
was actually kind of a nice name

2338.839 --> 2341.839
but

2350.96 --> 2358.079
hey thomas larson busters

2354.88 --> 2361.2000000000003
i haven't seen glow busters

2358.079 --> 2363.6800000000003
is glowbuster still live because i know

2361.2 --> 2364.72
jaren is still doing live things and

2363.68 --> 2367.1189999999997
last time

2364.72 --> 2368.48
this there was no globus it's just jaren

2367.119 --> 2372.56
live and

2368.48 --> 2372.56
bob was also on there

2374.079 --> 2383.8390000000004
did you mean that

2384.43 --> 2390.72
[Music]

2387.359 --> 2393.839
all right a real joe yeah yeah

2390.72 --> 2395.359
maybe if they want to why not

2393.839 --> 2396.64
i don't know if they want to do a show

2395.359 --> 2399.7599999999998
together though

2396.64 --> 2399.7599999999998
[Music]

2402.16 --> 2411.839
glow busters was on last sunday well

2405.68 --> 2411.839
i didn't see it all i saw was jaron live

2412.64 --> 2416.8799999999997
maybe people now just call it glow

2414.88 --> 2419.52
busters

2416.88 --> 2425.839
no matter what it is actually called i

2419.52 --> 2425.839
don't know

2428.24 --> 2432.3999999999996
or maybe i saw the wrong thing and just

2430.56 --> 2433.359
thought that that was glow busses okay

2432.4 --> 2439.839
well whatever i

2433.359 --> 2439.839
i haven't seen it

2446.64 --> 2452.96
yes and concerning the parallax i've

2449.76 --> 2454.8
here i've heard that

2452.96 --> 2467.839
through flat earth debates plenty of

2454.8 --> 2467.8390000000004
times already so

2478.839 --> 2481.839
okay

2492.16 --> 2495.839
no son come back

2505.84 --> 2509.219
[Music]

2525.359 --> 2537.839
what this is even slapper

2529.68 --> 2537.839
what is that

2538.32 --> 2541.4390000000003
[Music]

2555.599 --> 2558.56
oh it's a mouse

2562.64 --> 2567.2799999999997
or a type of it looks more like a

2564.72 --> 2568.8799999999997
squirrel really

2567.28 --> 2571.44
sort of in between a mouse and a

2568.88 --> 2571.44
squirrel

2572.079 --> 2579.8390000000004
the furry tail

2580.16 --> 2583.839
seven months per year wow

2585.68 --> 2588.24
that's cool

2590.8 --> 2593.8390000000004
okay tiny one more

2605.28 --> 2621.8390000000004
hello the beauty of nature

2628.4 --> 2635.839
ill and conspicuous

2632.64 --> 2635.839
me hello

2638.4 --> 2643.04
hmm i'm getting all kinds of new people

2641.599 --> 2649.599
in my chat that's good

2643.04 --> 2653.359
good to see you

2649.599 --> 2655.599
so i still got an hour and 12 minutes to

2653.359 --> 2655.5989999999997
go

2656.48 --> 2663.839
so i'm pretty much up for subjects

2660.0 --> 2663.839
for all sorts

2664.72 --> 2677.839
flat earth or otherwise

2684.48 --> 2686.88
okay

2688.24 --> 2705.839
or inconspicuous me you seem to have

2692.24 --> 2705.839
misspelled yourself

2733.599 --> 2739.119
yeah that's cute but you got an i

2736.96 --> 2747.839
then an l and then an n so you

2739.119 --> 2747.839
misspelled yourself

2755.359 --> 2762.4
oh well in that case there is a a

2758.56 --> 2765.52
small i and then a capital i

2762.4 --> 2765.52
it's still misspelled

2765.599 --> 2775.839
yeah that's called misspelling

2790.12 --> 2795.409
[Music]

2798.03 --> 2801.2290000000003
[Music]

2801.839 --> 2804.24
okay

2806.72 --> 2810.72
ah hey thank you ordinary bear see you

2809.599 --> 2812.53
later

2810.72 --> 2814.839
you keep crushing it too

2812.53 --> 2817.8390000000004
[Music]

2814.839 --> 2817.839
oh

2828.53 --> 2831.659
[Music]

2845.68 --> 2851.16
yeah i thought that maybe you would

2849.44 --> 2852.96
want to call yourself a little

2851.16 --> 2856.16
inconspicuous me

2852.96 --> 2858.64
because then it's actually a sentence

2856.16 --> 2860.72
or a description now it's just something

2858.64 --> 2863.2799999999997
that's really confusing at the start

2860.72 --> 2864.48
because yeah capital i in the middle of

2863.28 --> 2868.48
a word

2864.48 --> 2873.839
definitely looks like an l right

2868.48 --> 2873.839
so very nice intentions

2881.68 --> 2888.24
but whatever it's your account name

2885.92 --> 2888.2400000000002
right

2890.319 --> 2894.16
need more snow no

2895.359 --> 2901.839
enough of that

2915.52 --> 2923.2
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

2919.119 --> 2926.2400000000002
jared werner falsifies evidence what are

2923.2 --> 2926.24
this is nonsense

2927.04 --> 2931.52
why do you think trolls come in my chat

2929.44 --> 2935.44
and just start to straw man

2931.52 --> 2939.2
accuse people no backing

2935.44 --> 2940.8
why do you think that happens because

2939.2 --> 2942.7999999999997
yeah those people just make flat

2940.8 --> 2945.44
earthers look

2942.8 --> 2947.76
like there's a good reason to be there

2945.44 --> 2950.64
because people attacking

2947.76 --> 2957.8390000000004
and slandering for no reason why do you

2950.64 --> 2957.839
think that is jared werner

2967.92 --> 2972.8
not flat side admitted where are you

2970.0 --> 2972.8
getting that from

2973.359 --> 2978.7999999999997
what he's supposed to what has he

2975.2 --> 2980.8799999999997
supposed to have falsified then

2978.8 --> 2981.92
this is ridiculous why would we even

2980.88 --> 2985.119
need to

2981.92 --> 2989.28
like anyone what would we need

2985.119 --> 2993.44
to falsify there is nothing

2989.28 --> 2993.44
that we there is no need

2993.52 --> 2997.119
because where we won understand the

2996.64 --> 3001.04
earth

2997.119 --> 3004.7200000000003
is actually flat and not a globe

3001.04 --> 3008.24
we don't need to falsify anything

3004.72 --> 3008.24
there's no need for that at all

3010.24 --> 3014.24
all we have to do is continue figuring

3013.76 --> 3018.2400000000002
out

3014.24 --> 3018.24
more that's it

3018.64 --> 3022.48
it's no need for anything to be

3024.839 --> 3027.839
falsified

3040.4 --> 3044.88
where are you where did you hear that

3042.48 --> 3044.88
jared

3052.839 --> 3055.839
where

3074.8 --> 3079.119
your history oh so it's not even what

3079.2 --> 3085.5989999999997
okay well look

3082.559 --> 3087.28
maybe flat side like in the past at some

3085.599 --> 3090.559
point had been fooling around and just

3087.28 --> 3092.6400000000003
wanted to poke globers and maybe he did

3090.559 --> 3094.6400000000003
then screw around a little with that

3092.64 --> 3096.48
just to poke some harder well that's not

3094.64 --> 3099.68
very productive if he done that

3096.48 --> 3101.599
and i hope he never does that again

3099.68 --> 3103.839
but maybe he has done something like

3101.599 --> 3103.839
that

3103.92 --> 3108.2400000000002
i don't know what though like how are

3107.44 --> 3109.839
you even

3108.24 --> 3111.5989999999997
like what what are you supposed to

3109.839 --> 3114.64
falsify

3111.599 --> 3117.6800000000003
why would you need to ever

3114.64 --> 3117.68
i don't understand

3123.68 --> 3129.839
maybe control up done what that's

3126.88 --> 3129.839
ridiculous

3131.2 --> 3134.96
why now if he was control opposition he

3134.48 --> 3138.64
would

3134.96 --> 3142.48
constantly be trying

3138.64 --> 3142.96
to push it to push something wrong to

3142.48 --> 3146.2400000000002
push

3142.96 --> 3149.119
annoying things to to force it in

3146.24 --> 3151.04
that's not what he's doing at all like

3149.119 --> 3153.04
but he's still a human being so

3151.04 --> 3154.24
yeah maybe he might get overly

3153.04 --> 3156.079
frustrated and do

3154.24 --> 3159.2799999999997
do something that is actually kind of

3156.079 --> 3159.28
regrettable afterward

3159.44 --> 3163.76
you know we're all people everybody can

3162.8 --> 3165.6800000000003
make mistakes

3163.76 --> 3168.6400000000003
can be seduced to do something that they

3165.68 --> 3171.52
will end up regretting

3168.64 --> 3172.64
but that doesn't make them control

3171.52 --> 3176.319
opposition that's

3172.64 --> 3176.319
a little over dramatic there

3178.24 --> 3181.9199999999996
and besides if he's already like

3181.04 --> 3185.119
admitted it

3181.92 --> 3186.64
as you say then well that's a

3185.119 --> 3189.839
recognition that there is

3186.64 --> 3190.24
that he did something wrong a sign that

3189.839 --> 3192.16
he's

3190.24 --> 3194.16
very unlikely to do it again so i don't

3192.16 --> 3197.2799999999997
see a problem here at all

3194.16 --> 3209.839
and flat side is a pretty awesome guy

3197.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
he has very good videos

3211.839 --> 3214.0789999999997
what

3216.24 --> 3222.24
how flat oh wow okay so

3219.68 --> 3225.52
glad you are in the know julio pabin so

3222.24 --> 3228.8799999999997
this guy is basically misinterpreting

3225.52 --> 3237.839
like a presuppositional situation

3228.88 --> 3237.839
flat so it was sketching

3248.839 --> 3251.839
wow

3252.16 --> 3257.839
all right whatever

3255.92 --> 3259.28
fletcher is awesome and hey if he

3257.839 --> 3263.04
becomes less awesome

3259.28 --> 3265.28
i will notice you know look guys i've

3263.04 --> 3268.48
been here also with nathan in the flat

3265.28 --> 3271.3590000000004
earth debates for a long time now

3268.48 --> 3271.92
there's been plenty of people that came

3271.359 --> 3274.4
in

3271.92 --> 3275.76
and went away again sometimes in a

3274.4 --> 3278.2400000000002
really bad way

3275.76 --> 3280.48
yeah so i know every person that comes

3278.24 --> 3282.16
on hopson can be great and then at some

3280.48 --> 3284.079
point they just change their i have a

3282.16 --> 3285.92
change of heart

3284.079 --> 3288.2400000000002
right it's happened to quite a few

3285.92 --> 3288.2400000000002
people

3290.4 --> 3295.76
and yeah i still remember it of course

3292.88 --> 3299.44
the jose jg gonzalez

3295.76 --> 3304.2400000000002
ranty most notably

3299.44 --> 3306.4
right so hey if somebody just turns

3304.24 --> 3308.4799999999996
disinterested and goes away or starts to

3306.4 --> 3309.92
get like i'm superman and oakley of all

3308.48 --> 3310.88
this ranting or what yeah that can

3309.92 --> 3313.599
happen

3310.88 --> 3316.2400000000002
some people just grow sick of it then

3313.599 --> 3316.2400000000002
they go away

3317.2 --> 3322.0
they have a change of heart somehow but

3319.52 --> 3324.559
i don't think so i think flat side is

3322.0 --> 3325.76
is pretty comfortable right now with the

3324.559 --> 3330.079
show

3325.76 --> 3330.079
and the flat earth debate he's on pretty

3332.839 --> 3335.839
regularly

3339.92 --> 3343.599
is ranty a baller now no

3344.0 --> 3348.0
no he's just he doesn't want to deal

3346.799 --> 3351.839
with it anymore i think

3348.0 --> 3351.839
he's just trying to focus on other

3360.839 --> 3363.839
things

3365.68 --> 3372.769
[Music]

3389.28 --> 3391.44
uh

3393.2 --> 3397.839
no whatever jared look

3399.359 --> 3402.799
i don't see i don't even know who that

3402.4 --> 3404.559
is

3402.799 --> 3406.16
you know anybody could freaking call

3404.559 --> 3408.4
themselves whatever and then do all

3406.16 --> 3419.839
kinds of crazy [ __ ]

3408.4 --> 3419.839
i've never even heard of that guy

3427.54 --> 3430.9
[Music]

3442.16 --> 3445.2799999999997
just saying you're right about certain

3443.44 --> 3447.839
people being bad okay well good

3445.28 --> 3447.8390000000004
good on you

3449.68 --> 3454.24
right although look

3455.119 --> 3461.599
that sort of stuff i nah

3458.16 --> 3462.96
did that the guy you're talking about

3461.599 --> 3466.799
the canadian like

3462.96 --> 3470.799
i don't see that happening uh

3466.799 --> 3473.7599999999998
like that a lot what i was emphasizing

3470.799 --> 3475.92
more is just a change of heart

3473.76 --> 3478.1600000000003
not people coming out to be complete

3475.92 --> 3479.839
[ __ ] up creeps or whatever but

3478.16 --> 3483.52
rather just a change of heart and then

3479.839 --> 3486.16
the psychological polarization happens

3483.52 --> 3488.079
and they turn opponent or hostile with

3486.16 --> 3489.92
all the psychological warfare going

3488.079 --> 3490.6400000000003
around in the flat earth debates and all

3489.92 --> 3494.799
that

3490.64 --> 3502.5589999999997
in general yeah that then happens

3494.799 --> 3507.119
that sort of thing that can happen

3502.559 --> 3507.119
but yeah what you are describing that's

3508.799 --> 3511.119
that

3512.48 --> 3531.839
that's not common if that is even real i

3515.44 --> 3531.839
don't know who that guy is

3538.559 --> 3545.3590000000004
right but i i hope

3541.76 --> 3548.4
in general we can i can safely state

3545.359 --> 3551.7599999999998
that flat earth

3548.4 --> 3555.04
right flat earthers flat earth community

3551.76 --> 3558.079
does not in any way condone

3555.04 --> 3562.0
or accept pedophilia

3558.079 --> 3564.48
in any form at all

3562.0 --> 3565.28
right there's nobody that's going to do

3564.48 --> 3567.28
that

3565.28 --> 3568.48
because if they would we would freaking

3567.28 --> 3572.7200000000003
get on their asses

3568.48 --> 3576.559
and yeah reveal them for what they are

3572.72 --> 3581.2799999999997
so is he a plant

3576.559 --> 3583.52
or maybe yeah just a guy with issues

3581.28 --> 3585.52
that doesn't know how to handle those

3583.52 --> 3587.68
issues and then

3585.52 --> 3589.2
proceeds getting into flat earth just as

3587.68 --> 3590.5589999999997
a hobby or something you know what else

3589.2 --> 3593.04
are you going to do with your time

3590.559 --> 3593.0400000000004
perhaps

3599.68 --> 3604.16
but yeah he may be a plant i don't know

3602.48 --> 3605.68
george sanford i don't know the guy i

3604.16 --> 3607.5989999999997
don't really want to talk about this guy

3605.68 --> 3609.52
i've literally never heard of

3607.599 --> 3611.6800000000003
being accused by somebody in my chat

3609.52 --> 3615.68
that i've never spoken to

3611.68 --> 3617.52
right it's kind of a waste of my time a

3615.68 --> 3620.0789999999997
bit

3617.52 --> 3620.079
what is that

3621.92 --> 3629.839
terry 306 what

3646.72 --> 3651.2799999999997
yeah i knew about that

3652.16 --> 3660.24
yeah like flashiness

3655.2 --> 3660.24
and [ __ ] all that it has an effect

3660.96 --> 3663.68
it's interesting

3664.559 --> 3671.8390000000004
i didn't know was patented bizarre

3696.839 --> 3699.839
hmm

3708.0 --> 3713.839
okay interesting

3714.72 --> 3727.839
you think smartphones read thoughts what

3730.319 --> 3741.839
oh okay jared werner sure

3733.359 --> 3741.839
i didn't know that

3748.72 --> 3753.2799999999997
right all right jared look i didn't know

3751.68 --> 3754.3999999999996
i thought you were just some troll

3753.28 --> 3756.799
trying to smear

3754.4 --> 3757.76
flat earthers because that happens every

3756.799 --> 3760.079
now and then

3757.76 --> 3761.119
and apparently this is something real

3760.079 --> 3762.799
that's fine

3761.119 --> 3764.559
i really don't have anything to say

3762.799 --> 3765.119
about it i've never heard of the guy

3764.559 --> 3769.3590000000004
before

3765.119 --> 3772.88
now as you say flat earth folker

3769.359 --> 3773.5989999999997
and brian stathley did know him so yeah

3772.88 --> 3775.6800000000003
that

3773.599 --> 3777.3590000000004
asked them they knew him i have never

3775.68 --> 3781.2
heard of that person before

3777.359 --> 3797.839
so what use is my commentary on it

3781.2 --> 3797.839
you yeah

3808.839 --> 3814.48
right

3811.44 --> 3815.839
right yeah that's true yeah tara three

3814.48 --> 3819.359
or six like

3815.839 --> 3822.64
reading thoughts you don't need

3819.359 --> 3824.319
to read thoughts if you have a full grip

3822.64 --> 3827.44
of metadata

3824.319 --> 3830.72
because right

3827.44 --> 3834.7200000000003
what transpires in somebody's head

3830.72 --> 3838.799
is kind of a lot more predictable than

3834.72 --> 3840.48
we humans take for granted right

3838.799 --> 3842.16
computers that have oversight over

3840.48 --> 3846.079
metadata can

3842.16 --> 3848.3999999999996
predicts astoundingly accurate exactly

3846.079 --> 3850.6400000000003
what you're going to do based on and

3848.4 --> 3853.76
what you're going to think even

3850.64 --> 3856.64
it's pretty astounding how that works

3853.76 --> 3857.44
so all they need to do is just listen in

3856.64 --> 3862.5589999999997
in a

3857.44 --> 3866.559
very funnily similar way i do the same

3862.559 --> 3869.599
with me i just have to hear a person

3866.559 --> 3872.6400000000003
speak and potentially also

3869.599 --> 3876.48
see them and then just from that

3872.64 --> 3878.16
audio i can make up a whole damn lot

3876.48 --> 3880.0
i've just built this skill through my

3878.16 --> 3883.1189999999997
subconscious i can do that

3880.0 --> 3887.44
it's feels similar as to

3883.119 --> 3887.44
what the algorithm can do

3887.599 --> 3891.599
they just do it mechanically through

3890.0 --> 3894.319
preponderance of data

3891.599 --> 3898.0
and understanding that data having

3894.319 --> 3898.0
figured out how these things work

3905.68 --> 3910.48
never speak in front of my phone well

3907.2 --> 3914.16
you'd have to completely cover it up

3910.48 --> 3915.76
in order for it not to hear things right

3914.16 --> 3917.5989999999997
and it's not just your phone by the way

3915.76 --> 3921.119
it's most equipment

3917.599 --> 3923.2000000000003
most electronic equipment has some kind

3921.119 --> 3926.48
of computer

3923.2 --> 3929.2
thing in it yeah just

3926.48 --> 3930.559
even just a digital display of some kind

3929.2 --> 3935.1189999999997
with numbers

3930.559 --> 3935.119
like potentially up to calculators

3935.359 --> 3940.0
if they're somehow plugged into the

3937.119 --> 3941.6800000000003
electric net they don't run battery only

3940.0 --> 3944.319
and they don't like phones have of

3941.68 --> 3947.7599999999998
course wireless capability

3944.319 --> 3950.24
but yeah a lot of equipment doesn't

3947.76 --> 3952.079
but if they then can still plug into the

3950.24 --> 3956.16
electric net

3952.079 --> 3958.4
then they have spy capability potential

3956.16 --> 3960.48
and most equipment electronic equipment

3958.4 --> 3962.559
and especially computer equipment after

3960.48 --> 3965.92
2010

3962.559 --> 3967.1600000000003
or even before that has all of it it's

3965.92 --> 3971.039
in everything

3967.16 --> 3972.799
everything everything you'd literally

3971.039 --> 3975.76
have to make a machine

3972.799 --> 3978.16
completely from square scratch including

3975.76 --> 3982.4
the very electronics

3978.16 --> 3993.5989999999997
to avoid it everything has it in it

3982.4 --> 3995.44
it's standardized

3993.599 --> 3998.48
or at least i was made to believe and i

3995.44 --> 3998.48
wouldn't be surprised

4001.599 --> 4011.28
the internet of things is part of that

4007.2 --> 4011.2799999999997
that same potential

4016.64 --> 4023.839
yeah and besides like even

4020.24 --> 4027.0389999999998
freaking light bulbs okay yeah

4023.839 --> 4031.0389999999998
would you believe that light bulbs

4027.039 --> 4034.48
have information gathering capabilities

4031.039 --> 4036.3190000000004
right not talking about the

4034.48 --> 4039.68
old-fashioned light bulbs but i'm

4036.319 --> 4043.0389999999998
talking about like the more modern ones

4039.68 --> 4046.0
they have it every freaking

4043.039 --> 4046.96
light bulb has information gathering

4046.0 --> 4048.64
capabilities

4046.96 --> 4063.839
okay so yeah it's going to be a little

4048.64 --> 4063.839
difficult to get around that

4074.839 --> 4077.839
hmm

4081.68 --> 4085.1189999999997
that's right dr gonzo

4088.319 --> 4093.2
there i bet there have been pretty big

4090.96 --> 4095.119
lizards though a couple

4093.2 --> 4096.799
i think that some point there were

4095.119 --> 4100.400000000001
pretty big lizards not as

4096.799 --> 4102.48
huge as the mega dinosaurs perhaps

4100.4 --> 4104.08
maybe there were some of them around but

4102.48 --> 4105.5199999999995
they were just in the middle of

4104.08 --> 4108.5599999999995
everything else

4105.52 --> 4110.56
they were just the big reptiles among

4108.56 --> 4113.759
all the other animals so it was never

4110.56 --> 4116.400000000001
like before

4113.759 --> 4118.319
before the mammal or something you know

4116.4 --> 4121.599999999999
that's how they portray that

4118.319 --> 4123.92
to abide with evolution idea

4121.6 --> 4125.839
no if there were any kind of like big

4123.92 --> 4128.88
lizards they were just there

4125.839 --> 4130.88
with all the other creatures

4128.88 --> 4132.0
and i think that probably at some point

4130.88 --> 4135.4400000000005
during the atlantean

4132.0 --> 4139.04
age or whatever like there were even

4135.44 --> 4142.159
humans riding lizards

4139.04 --> 4143.6
they would use them as quick riding

4142.159 --> 4147.5199999999995
animals

4143.6 --> 4149.4400000000005
i think that happened

4147.52 --> 4151.1990000000005
not i don't have elaborate evidence for

4149.44 --> 4154.5599999999995
it but hey if there were these freaking

4151.199 --> 4157.44
lizards out there and you could

4154.56 --> 4160.319
would be pretty badass to write one of

4157.44 --> 4162.96
those especially if they had like a

4160.319 --> 4164.319
potential poisonous bite or anything on

4162.96 --> 4166.719
top of that too

4164.319 --> 4168.2390000000005
you know you can really have like a

4166.719 --> 4172.319
battle animal like that

4168.239 --> 4172.3189999999995
so yeah who knows

4172.88 --> 4179.359
okay voynich sure you do

4176.88 --> 4180.4800000000005
huh but i think that there were big

4179.359 --> 4183.679
lizards but

4180.48 --> 4184.799
the dinosaurs as they say that never

4183.679 --> 4187.279
existed

4184.799 --> 4188.799
and creatures like the t-rex absolutely

4187.279 --> 4191.6
never exists it's absolutely

4188.799 --> 4191.6
preposterous

4193.92 --> 4203.84
the giant angry chicken with big teeth

4208.239 --> 4212.08
hey i could kill the hope good to see

4212.71 --> 4217.84
[Music]

4214.84 --> 4217.84
you

4221.23 --> 4231.839999999999
[Music]

4228.84 --> 4231.84
so

4234.32 --> 4240.08
yeah how are you doing there in the

4237.44 --> 4240.08
in the east

4242.64 --> 4245.84
in the east of the netherlands

4249.84 --> 4254.719
hey seeking star wars rob h good to see

4256.84 --> 4260.8
you

4258.88 --> 4263.36
missing all the lockdown [ __ ] yeah that

4260.8 --> 4263.360000000001
is awesome

4264.08 --> 4267.04
moving inwards

4270.96 --> 4275.199
yeah that was great timing man for you

4273.28 --> 4279.36
to go there at that point

4275.199 --> 4280.879999999999
that's like i'd almost say you lucky

4279.36 --> 4287.36
bastard

4280.88 --> 4289.92
but yeah it was meant to be

4287.36 --> 4291.04
but anyway over here right now it's not

4289.92 --> 4292.88
even that bad

4291.04 --> 4296.96
it's still very annoying though i don't

4292.88 --> 4296.96
like the the curfew is really

4298.84 --> 4301.84
annoying

4327.199 --> 4331.04
titans roam the earth oh yeah thomas

4330.0 --> 4333.199
larson

4331.04 --> 4335.44
that's funny because i have a period for

4333.199 --> 4335.44
this

4336.64 --> 4343.4400000000005
it's the age of wonders when

4340.08 --> 4343.84
just incredibly when all the powers were

4343.44 --> 4347.919999999999
just

4343.84 --> 4350.8
everywhere and giant titans indeed were

4347.92 --> 4350.8
roaming the earth

4353.36 --> 4357.28
and then they were destroyed and from

4355.36 --> 4360.32
that came the atlantean

4357.28 --> 4360.32
empire pretty much

4360.8 --> 4366.4800000000005
and then the flood and then yeah the

4363.44 --> 4366.48
post-flood world

4368.239 --> 4371.839999999999
i've got it all mapped out

4385.679 --> 4391.12
fossils are fake as well no things can

4389.28 --> 4395.36
be fossilized

4391.12 --> 4397.679
dr gonzo definitely thing is though

4395.36 --> 4399.759999999999
you things can get fossilized really

4397.679 --> 4403.679
quickly

4399.76 --> 4407.04
like really quickly in a matter of weeks

4403.679 --> 4410.88
right so fossilization process is not

4407.04 --> 4412.32
the inevitable end result of being very

4410.88 --> 4414.400000000001
very old

4412.32 --> 4417.12
because once something petrifies you

4414.4 --> 4420.5599999999995
can't really

4417.12 --> 4421.199
chemically or otherwise measure how old

4420.56 --> 4427.84
they are

4421.199 --> 4427.839999999999
anymore because they're petrified

4438.84 --> 4441.84
right

4447.76 --> 4452.320000000001
oh growing fish in high pressure tanks

4450.64 --> 4455.12
makes them big that is

4452.32 --> 4458.239
very interesting alkyl though but isn't

4455.12 --> 4460.159
it a bit of a hassle to feed them

4458.239 --> 4464.0
how do you feed them if they are in a

4460.159 --> 4464.0
tank that is constantly pressurized

4464.719 --> 4468.88
because i don't think that

4466.52 --> 4470.56
depressurizing them every time

4468.88 --> 4472.64
when you feed them is going to be good

4470.56 --> 4474.400000000001
for them

4472.64 --> 4483.84
but maybe i'm wrong but it sounds

4474.4 --> 4483.839999999999
interesting i've never heard of that

4484.8 --> 4488.0
oh what's going on

4491.36 --> 4498.799999999999
oh flat earth turret

4494.84 --> 4501.04
tarot project is going to be published

4498.8 --> 4503.679
wakey wakey has joined my project oh

4501.04 --> 4503.679
that is cool

4508.84 --> 4511.84
huh

4530.239 --> 4533.36
but yeah congratulations there seeking

4532.56 --> 4536.0
star wars

4533.36 --> 4536.0
very cool

4536.56 --> 4540.96
but yeah i would definitely be honored

4539.84 --> 4545.12
if you would

4540.96 --> 4545.12
get on my show to maybe promote it

4550.84 --> 4553.84
sometime

4568.56 --> 4572.2390000000005
awesome hey i can't freaking talk about

4571.36 --> 4575.28
tarot i don't

4572.239 --> 4576.959999999999
typically do it because to me it's not a

4575.28 --> 4578.88
very conscious process

4576.96 --> 4581.12
it's just like yeah every time tarot

4578.88 --> 4584.96
happens i take it seriously like

4581.12 --> 4584.96
incredible things come rolling out

4586.0 --> 4590.32
but i try to do it the least as possible

4589.12 --> 4592.32
i'm not a guy that's going to be

4590.32 --> 4595.84
oh i'm going to road today i'm going to

4592.32 --> 4595.84
do it tomorrow no no

4596.08 --> 4599.76
it's like i only do it when it's

4597.76 --> 4601.679
necessary

4599.76 --> 4609.84
right that sounds kind of weird perhaps

4601.679 --> 4609.84
to people but that's how i do it

4620.239 --> 4626.32
right yeah sick star water if you wanna

4623.28 --> 4626.32
or when you're ready

4626.719 --> 4633.36

oh hand drawn by you wow

4636.4 --> 4641.759999999999
oh that i now i really want you on the

4639.76 --> 4643.92

take your time

4644.8 --> 4648.96
as much as you need but just so you know

4647.199 --> 4651.678999999999
i'm definitely up for

4648.96 --> 4654.2390000000005
having you on the show for that it'll be

4651.679 --> 4654.2390000000005
very cool

4661.04 --> 4679.84
do i go on any flat earth discords jml

4666.159 --> 4679.839999999999
or jm laylor right yes i do sometimes

4683.92 --> 4689.04
right yeah seeking star wars like i want

4686.64 --> 4691.84
to see it and if it's really good

4689.04 --> 4694.32
i would even go to some other guys

4691.84 --> 4694.32
perhaps

4694.64 --> 4700.8
like maybe talk to i don't know david

4698.239 --> 4702.32
weiss perhaps like he is very well in

4700.8 --> 4705.679
know of the scene

4702.32 --> 4708.88
with this sort of thing and uh

4705.679 --> 4712.2390000000005
i know maybe crow triple seven

4708.88 --> 4714.08
he is into tarot so i bet he would be

4712.239 --> 4715.599999999999
interested to at least have you on about

4714.08 --> 4717.5199999999995
it

4715.6 --> 4720.4800000000005
to make a whole tour around the scenes

4717.52 --> 4723.679
with it

4720.48 --> 4723.678999999999
if you want to that is

4732.08 --> 4749.76
maybe even mark sargent will have you on

4734.4 --> 4763.839999999999
i bet he wouldn't object

4749.76 --> 4763.84
all right awesome man that's really cool

4780.159 --> 4784.0
yeah dr gonzo yeah yeah taro they're

4782.88 --> 4787.4400000000005
cards

4784.0 --> 4787.44
they definitely exist

4787.92 --> 4791.84
people do things with them

4792.0 --> 4796.4
and some people like it some don't it's

4795.199 --> 4799.44
all about its

4796.4 --> 4802.839999999999
information it's all information

4799.44 --> 4804.159
and yeah it may be very weird to some

4802.84 --> 4805.92
people

4804.159 --> 4808.0
but others yeah they know what to do

4805.92 --> 4810.96
with it and it is there

4808.0 --> 4811.52
that tarot is there people have these

4810.96 --> 4813.199
cards

4811.52 --> 4814.96
they do say things they have

4813.199 --> 4816.32
instructions whether you believe it or

4814.96 --> 4819.84
not is something else

4816.32 --> 4820.799999999999
what it says but it exists we know it

4819.84 --> 4825.6
does

4820.8 --> 4828.96
right on the other hand outer space

4825.6 --> 4831.92
a vacuum outer space dinosaurs

4828.96 --> 4834.32
those are concepts and there's no real

4831.92 --> 4837.679
evidence for it

4834.32 --> 4839.12
and outer space is even like a physical

4837.679 --> 4840.96
impossibility

4839.12 --> 4842.719
the gas would fill the space we there

4840.96 --> 4844.84
can't be in outer space

4842.719 --> 4847.199
if we have gas pressure here that we can

4844.84 --> 4847.84
breathe right with dinosaurs it's a

4847.199 --> 4849.759999999999
little bit

4847.84 --> 4852.2390000000005
more complicated but there's just

4849.76 --> 4854.96
overwhelming

4852.239 --> 4856.799999999999
evidence from a critical viewers

4854.96 --> 4859.6
standpoint

4856.8 --> 4862.320000000001
that a lot has been falsified concerning

4859.6 --> 4862.320000000001
dinosaurs

4862.4 --> 4867.36
it's almost almost public knowledge by

4865.12 --> 4867.36
now

4871.92 --> 4875.1990000000005
like in the past when you go into the

4873.679 --> 4877.76
past with

4875.199 --> 4879.759999999999
dinosaur museum exhibitions and all that

4877.76 --> 4881.76
yeah they never actually show any real

4879.76 --> 4884.08
bones and make up all kinds of weird

4881.76 --> 4887.4400000000005
excuses about radiation or

4884.08 --> 4888.0
whatever they can to not show the actual

4887.44 --> 4891.44
bones for

4888.0 --> 4893.84
testing every single time

4891.44 --> 4894.879999999999
so that is extremely suspicious that

4893.84 --> 4898.56
that happens

4894.88 --> 4902.0
and that it is accepted by the wider

4898.56 --> 4904.639
museum community right what's it called

4902.0 --> 4904.639
again the uh

4906.719 --> 4917.84
you know which one i mean from that's a

4909.52 --> 4917.84
name again

4918.96 --> 4933.199
what's the name again guys

4930.56 --> 4934.400000000001
can i have your attention please right

4933.199 --> 4939.44
now

4934.4 --> 4939.44
it's the name again the institute

4940.239 --> 4947.36
the museum institute that is

4944.159 --> 4950.08
basically well falsified this dinosaur

4947.36 --> 4951.28
stuff smithsonian that's right that's

4950.08 --> 4953.76
the one yes

4951.28 --> 4953.759999999999
thank you

4955.44 --> 4960.4
all right so it's not fake in the sense

4959.12 --> 4962.639
as space is fake

4960.4 --> 4964.96
space is just something you believe is

4962.639 --> 4968.0
possible but when you figure it out it's

4964.96 --> 4969.679
literally impossible dinosaurs is a

4968.0 --> 4970.639
little bit more difficult because who's

4969.679 --> 4972.96
to say that

4970.639 --> 4974.08
giant lizards might not have existed at

4972.96 --> 4977.04
some point

4974.08 --> 4979.36
it's just that how they present it is

4977.04 --> 4983.12
definitely not true

4979.36 --> 4986.08
like definitely not true it definitely

4983.12 --> 4987.5199999999995
did not happen that way right so who

4986.08 --> 4991.36
knows big lizards

4987.52 --> 4994.56
some sorts have existed at some point

4991.36 --> 4995.92
yeah they didn't pre-exist and roamed

4994.56 --> 4998.320000000001
and ruled the world

4995.92 --> 4999.04
everywhere when there was barely any

4998.32 --> 5000.799999999999
mammals

4999.04 --> 5002.08
and then they died out because of some

5000.8 --> 5004.719
cataclysmic event

5002.08 --> 5005.5199999999995
and then millions and millions of years

5004.719 --> 5008.0
for the

5005.52 --> 5009.280000000001
mammals to evolve and overtake as the

5008.0 --> 5015.28
prime species yeah

5009.28 --> 5018.8
that story is absolute [ __ ]

5015.28 --> 5020.0
absolute [ __ ] right doesn't mean

5018.8 --> 5023.12
that there haven't

5020.0 --> 5025.92
existed any kind of giant lizards

5023.12 --> 5026.48
that doesn't mean that at all it's just

5025.92 --> 5029.08
that

5026.48 --> 5031.28
the way the story they roll it out that

5029.08 --> 5035.84
absolutely did not happen

5031.28 --> 5035.84
not a chance that's complete fiction

5040.88 --> 5044.400000000001
i'm certified mandela affected what is

5043.679 --> 5049.6
that

5044.4 --> 5049.599999999999
what the hell voinich are you blabbering

5054.84 --> 5057.84
about

5061.36 --> 5065.44
yeah dinosaur bones were made of giant

5064.48 --> 5068.48
humans because

5065.44 --> 5071.5199999999995
human giants yeah they existed

5068.48 --> 5073.839999999999
guaranteed hundred percent existed yeah

5071.52 --> 5075.360000000001
it's quite the opposite there right so

5073.84 --> 5077.12
many giant bones

5075.36 --> 5080.48
been discarded destroyed by the

5077.12 --> 5083.599999999999
smithsonian are hidden

5080.48 --> 5086.239
not addressed not dug up

5083.6 --> 5087.76
to be displayed for everybody because

5086.239 --> 5089.28
when somebody would do that they would

5087.76 --> 5093.280000000001
come in and literally

5089.28 --> 5097.599999999999
confiscate it and destroy it total

5093.28 --> 5101.199
total violation in so many ways it's

5097.6 --> 5101.92
it's like really evil to do that to hide

5101.199 --> 5104.719
information

5101.92 --> 5105.28
and destroy just p people's resting

5104.719 --> 5108.2390000000005
place

5105.28 --> 5109.04
like that dishonor them by literally

5108.239 --> 5112.0
erasing

5109.04 --> 5113.679
their very existence that they have ever

5112.0 --> 5117.28
been right

5113.679 --> 5119.6
because yeah even if you die

5117.28 --> 5120.48
whatever physically is left of you is

5119.6 --> 5123.679
proof

5120.48 --> 5125.5199999999995
that you existed in some way

5123.679 --> 5128.12
if that's literally going to be erased

5125.52 --> 5141.84
that's just that is so evil

5128.12 --> 5141.84
unbelievably evil

5142.8 --> 5146.0
i think it's more evil to literally

5145.199 --> 5149.44
erase

5146.0 --> 5152.159
the existence of something than it is to

5149.44 --> 5153.44
create something false and suggest that

5152.159 --> 5155.759999999999
it exists

5153.44 --> 5156.638999999999
because at least you can disprove that

5155.76 --> 5160.0
but

5156.639 --> 5163.52
something that is erased from

5160.0 --> 5166.159
yeah from proof of being there

5163.52 --> 5167.6
how will the future ever find out it was

5166.159 --> 5169.759999999999
there in the first place

5167.6 --> 5170.639
and not just the made-up story by then

5169.76 --> 5173.280000000001
right

5170.639 --> 5173.84
so the damage is much more irreparable

5173.28 --> 5177.12
that way

5173.84 --> 5180.2390000000005
than if some institute or some group

5177.12 --> 5181.44
conspires to make up a fake story about

5180.239 --> 5183.839999999999
something

5181.44 --> 5183.839999999999
right

5186.02 --> 5189.189
[Music]

5192.76 --> 5198.1990000000005
[Music]

5202.32 --> 5206.08
all right i'm not convinced of giant

5204.239 --> 5209.44
people great men of renown

5206.08 --> 5212.48
can just mean fame and no no

5209.44 --> 5216.159
now giants absolutely very

5212.48 --> 5219.839999999999
very large humans

5216.159 --> 5224.08
very large up to 20 meters tall

5219.84 --> 5227.360000000001
there's many a testimony of that

5224.08 --> 5230.4
like in ancient literature even

5227.36 --> 5232.799999999999
figureheads historical figures that were

5230.4 --> 5235.679
literally giants nobody likes to talk

5232.8 --> 5235.679
about that part

5235.84 --> 5242.08
like historical individuals with like

5239.04 --> 5244.639
plenty of evidence and even like

5242.08 --> 5246.159
noted testimonies about confrontations

5244.639 --> 5247.04
about being astounded that he's so

5246.159 --> 5250.4
freaking big

5247.04 --> 5252.96
right yeah and not just like

5250.4 --> 5253.839999999999
big bear owen benjamin sized large

5252.96 --> 5256.639
people

5253.84 --> 5257.28
like half giants as you would say but

5256.639 --> 5260.32
like

5257.28 --> 5263.36
really freaking twice or more

5260.32 --> 5266.08
tall than regular people right

5263.36 --> 5267.04
giants yeah they existed they existed

5266.08 --> 5269.44
after the flood

5267.04 --> 5271.28
plenty until they were all wiped out

5269.44 --> 5273.919999999999
pretty much by

5271.28 --> 5277.199
the roman empire probably i suspect them

5273.92 --> 5277.1990000000005
the most of having done that

5277.36 --> 5282.4
if that even was a thing the very roman

5279.679 --> 5286.4
empire might be a giant cover story

5282.4 --> 5290.799999999999
but whoever was there and part of that

5286.4 --> 5294.08
probably did that right

5290.8 --> 5296.0
human superior superiorists

5294.08 --> 5298.48
it would just eradicate the giants maybe

5296.0 --> 5300.88
they even used the bible as an excuse to

5298.48 --> 5300.879999999999
do it

5301.199 --> 5309.839999999999
or the pre-bible the torah

5304.239 --> 5309.839999999999
i don't know

5312.63 --> 5318.159000000001
[Music]

5315.28 --> 5320.639
giant bones weren't real [ __ ]

5318.159 --> 5324.32
they're all over the freaking place

5320.639 --> 5327.84
howard moore everywhere

5324.32 --> 5329.92
it's not fake real bones

5327.84 --> 5330.88
and they're still there they still get

5329.92 --> 5332.8
dug up

5330.88 --> 5334.400000000001
because there will a whole damn lot of

5332.8 --> 5336.96
them everywhere

5334.4 --> 5338.08
everywhere different giant tribes around

5336.96 --> 5341.12
the world

5338.08 --> 5342.0
sighted historical like even in the

5341.12 --> 5346.0
netherlands

5342.0 --> 5348.32
okay there is very old history

5346.0 --> 5350.639
that involves giants that were just like

5348.32 --> 5351.44
yeah they were there yeah they were a

5350.639 --> 5354.56
nuisance

5351.44 --> 5358.239
yeah but they were freaking there right

5354.56 --> 5361.679
so yeah giants real they were actually

5358.239 --> 5363.599999999999
real and i know historians

5361.679 --> 5366.159
and people in school would love to are

5363.6 --> 5369.120000000001
so symbolic oh they were just

5366.159 --> 5370.5599999999995
very big man no they were freaking

5369.12 --> 5374.08
giants they were very

5370.56 --> 5377.1990000000005
very large physically large humans

5374.08 --> 5381.12
yeah giants not metaphorical

5377.199 --> 5383.919999999999
literal giants yeah they were there

5381.12 --> 5384.639
and there probably still are some

5383.92 --> 5387.4400000000005
somewhere

5384.639 --> 5388.400000000001
and i'm also pretty sure that a whole

5387.44 --> 5392.159
lot of them

5388.4 --> 5395.36
mix in with humans so that some people

5392.159 --> 5398.48
will just be bigger

5395.36 --> 5402.08
than the average no proof that yeah

5398.48 --> 5402.799999999999
yeah yeah it's everywhere i'm not even

5402.08 --> 5405.36
going to

5402.8 --> 5406.2390000000005
basically try to defend against your

5405.36 --> 5409.759999999999
skepticism

5406.239 --> 5413.04
i know they were there

5409.76 --> 5416.08
yeah i know it i

5413.04 --> 5418.96
know it nobody's going to dissuade that

5416.08 --> 5420.0
from me show us then well hey if i if i

5418.96 --> 5422.159
run into an actual

5420.0 --> 5423.76
giant some point i might go looking for

5422.159 --> 5426.159
them maybe

5423.76 --> 5428.639
when i know it's safe if like the empire

5426.159 --> 5430.4
is absolutely dead and no freaking

5428.639 --> 5432.84
jesuit agent is gonna follow in my

5430.4 --> 5436.4
footsteps to kill it all off

5432.84 --> 5439.76
right when i know they're gone

5436.4 --> 5442.159
the evil is finally absolutely destroyed

5439.76 --> 5445.280000000001
forever with no more capabilities of

5442.159 --> 5446.839999999999
ever continuing their evil plans their

5445.28 --> 5448.159
plans of world domination and

5446.84 --> 5451.28
destruction

5448.159 --> 5453.759999999999
then yeah who knows how many things are

5451.28 --> 5458.48
going to come out of the shadows

5453.76 --> 5461.360000000001
yeah like if this real new world order

5458.48 --> 5462.0
devil thing that is plaguing humanity

5461.36 --> 5465.36
for the last

5462.0 --> 5467.92
few centuries at least if it is

5465.36 --> 5470.0
absolutely over with and like literally

5467.92 --> 5472.88
all the darkness is unv

5470.0 --> 5475.199
unveiled and destroyed civil war

5472.88 --> 5476.56
whatever the [ __ ] it's gonna take

5475.199 --> 5478.32
then there's a big chance that

5476.56 --> 5480.56
afterwards when things really

5478.32 --> 5481.92
turn out to now be stable and over with

5480.56 --> 5483.92
and people can finally

5481.92 --> 5485.52
move on with just being normal human

5483.92 --> 5487.36
beings you'll see

5485.52 --> 5489.1990000000005
all kinds of freaking weird things

5487.36 --> 5491.599999999999
coming out of the shadows

5489.199 --> 5492.48
they were literally hiding from the

5491.6 --> 5494.639
devil

5492.48 --> 5496.0
that would destroy them if they would

5494.639 --> 5499.1990000000005
reveal themselves

5496.0 --> 5502.4
okay so i'll bet you

5499.199 --> 5504.48
if we ever live to see the day where the

5502.4 --> 5506.638999999999
new world order is truly

5504.48 --> 5508.48
and permanently destroyed and everything

5506.639 --> 5509.6
around us literally changes

5508.48 --> 5511.599999999999
psychologically

5509.6 --> 5514.0
like everything will change because of

5511.6 --> 5517.1990000000005
that pressure falling away

5514.0 --> 5520.08
then yeah that might be

5517.199 --> 5521.599999999999
the time where literally giants will

5520.08 --> 5524.159
start to come out of their caves and

5521.6 --> 5527.1990000000005
just show themselves to media

5524.159 --> 5530.159
like hi yes is it finally over

5527.199 --> 5530.839999999999
can we can we please have a right to

5530.159 --> 5533.839999999999
live

5530.84 --> 5533.84
now

5557.44 --> 5562.4
yeah that's right julio pebbin bible

5560.32 --> 5565.679
supports giants

5562.4 --> 5569.599999999999
and there is no reason for

5565.679 --> 5573.12
it to have it in there if there weren't

5569.6 --> 5576.320000000001
giants there's no

5573.12 --> 5580.96
reason to make

5576.32 --> 5583.679
it up there's no reason for it

5580.96 --> 5585.28
like in a story like it might be a

5583.679 --> 5587.6
reason like you might use oh

5585.28 --> 5590.32
giants is a straw man or something to

5587.6 --> 5592.88
get people riled up in a local situation

5590.32 --> 5593.759999999999
temporary when it comes down to like a

5592.88 --> 5596.719
what is

5593.76 --> 5597.92
considerably a historical document in

5596.719 --> 5600.84
many ways

5597.92 --> 5603.76
there's no damn reason to put it all in

5600.84 --> 5606.8
there

5603.76 --> 5609.1990000000005
why why would they have done that then

5606.8 --> 5610.96
makes no damn sense no no no giants were

5609.199 --> 5614.4
absolutely real

5610.96 --> 5616.96
they were there and now

5614.4 --> 5619.679
yeah not so much anymore there might

5616.96 --> 5621.84
still be some around

5619.679 --> 5623.04
but yeah humanity has absolutely

5621.84 --> 5625.84
overtaken

5623.04 --> 5627.44
the world because i'm pretty sure that

5625.84 --> 5629.679
way back

5627.44 --> 5631.839999999999
giants were probably dominating they

5629.679 --> 5632.88
were probably the leaders among people

5631.84 --> 5645.84
even within

5632.88 --> 5645.84
the atlantean empire

5656.239 --> 5661.5199999999995
yes i know terry 306 yeah i remember

5659.36 --> 5661.5199999999995
that

5665.36 --> 5669.199
and maybe as you say everybody was

5667.36 --> 5671.199
giants maybe i don't know

5669.199 --> 5673.759999999999
i think that people are getting smaller

5671.199 --> 5674.5599999999995
over time but i also think it is because

5673.76 --> 5676.400000000001
of the beast

5674.56 --> 5679.52
it is because we are literally being

5676.4 --> 5683.199
screwed around with and poisoned

5679.52 --> 5683.1990000000005
and it is like even

5684.8 --> 5692.96
the book brave new world literally

5689.199 --> 5696.719
tells you in detail on how

5692.96 --> 5699.28
poisoning people during like their

5696.719 --> 5701.28
development stage in pregnancy and all

5699.28 --> 5703.599999999999
that and although they breed them

5701.28 --> 5705.599999999999
in that book by that time right how

5703.6 --> 5709.360000000001
poisoning you make you smaller

5705.6 --> 5712.639
they literally tell it to you right so

5709.36 --> 5716.0
yeah what's gonna happen if the beast

5712.639 --> 5719.679
psychopath system is

5716.0 --> 5722.159
controlling the world from the shadows

5719.679 --> 5722.96
or even overtly and just gradually

5722.159 --> 5725.36
poisoning

5722.96 --> 5726.2390000000005
everyone and everything constantly

5725.36 --> 5729.28
trying to get

5726.239 --> 5730.48
some level of poison through in whatever

5729.28 --> 5733.119
way

5730.48 --> 5735.599999999999
they seem fit and just making people

5733.119 --> 5738.0
accept it that yeah over time

5735.6 --> 5739.84
continually getting poisoned slightly

5738.0 --> 5743.84
it's not surprising that humans are

5739.84 --> 5743.84
becoming smaller and smaller over time

5745.44 --> 5749.599999999999
maybe if we stopped getting poisoned on

5747.84 --> 5752.96
a continual basis from

5749.6 --> 5754.0
all sides in every spectrum that it

5752.96 --> 5757.199
would reverse

5754.0 --> 5760.56
that we would actually grow larger again

5757.199 --> 5764.879999999999
when i was young i even heard this story

5760.56 --> 5767.6
said like yeah if you just eat healthier

5764.88 --> 5771.84
get less poison then you'll probably

5767.6 --> 5771.84
grow bigger

5774.159 --> 5778.799999999999
and hey i wanted to become bigger and i

5776.56 --> 5778.8
did

5778.96 --> 5784.2390000000005
because i heard that like in pre-teen

5780.8 --> 5785.679
time but it really stuck to me like that

5784.239 --> 5787.28
was the analysis

5785.679 --> 5791.4400000000005
of the preponderance of all this

5787.28 --> 5795.04
information by my parents at the time

5791.44 --> 5795.04
before the internet no less

5796.159 --> 5802.4
the poison keeps you small if you

5799.679 --> 5803.6
get poison during growth you the growth

5802.4 --> 5807.199
doesn't

5803.6 --> 5809.4400000000005
grow as much that's it that's why it's

5807.199 --> 5812.159
kind of critical to not drink alcohol

5809.44 --> 5813.678999999999
during growth periods that's why it's

5812.159 --> 5817.5199999999995
also extremely damaging for

5813.679 --> 5821.84
yeah for non-adults to drink alcohol

5817.52 --> 5821.84
it's literally going to damage their

5824.84 --> 5827.84
growth

5853.119 --> 5856.96
they took over the masonry they cannot

5855.04 --> 5860.08
build yeah

5856.96 --> 5860.96
well i suggested that things like the

5860.08 --> 5864.159
pyramids

5860.96 --> 5867.36
that the pre-flood

5864.159 --> 5870.96
things out there that they were

5867.36 --> 5873.08
built by giants for giants

5870.96 --> 5874.719
like they were energy energy

5873.08 --> 5877.84
distributors

5874.719 --> 5879.76
that would feed the giants

5877.84 --> 5881.76
so that they would not have to eat as

5879.76 --> 5883.84
much they would feed

5881.76 --> 5886.2390000000005
them electrically because being a very

5883.84 --> 5890.2390000000005
large giant

5886.239 --> 5894.159
will yeah the bigger you get the more

5890.239 --> 5896.239
food you need to survive being that big

5894.159 --> 5897.759999999999
unless you're like really slow that's

5896.239 --> 5900.718999999999
why really big

5897.76 --> 5901.76
big animals out there whales giant

5900.719 --> 5905.679
elephants

5901.76 --> 5907.76
why they're always kind of slow because

5905.679 --> 5909.36
if they get into action they literally

5907.76 --> 5913.04
break themselves up because

5909.36 --> 5914.239
being big you either have to eat a giant

5913.04 --> 5917.28
amount to basically

5914.239 --> 5918.879999999999
be strong and armored and repaired

5917.28 --> 5921.28
constantly

5918.88 --> 5923.119
or you know you become kind of fragile

5921.28 --> 5925.599999999999
and you have to be slow or you're going

5923.119 --> 5929.119
to implode or damage

5925.6 --> 5932.56
right so the giants might have fixed

5929.119 --> 5935.36
that issue by creating pyramidal energy

5932.56 --> 5937.4400000000005
generators utilizing streaming water

5935.36 --> 5939.119
amplifying the electric tension from

5937.44 --> 5942.0
that through stone

5939.119 --> 5943.28
technology electrical stone knowing how

5942.0 --> 5945.119
to work that

5943.28 --> 5947.84
that would cause like a tesla coil

5945.119 --> 5948.48
effect and send out energy in the local

5947.84 --> 5951.119000000001
area

5948.48 --> 5953.44
that the giants would be able to use to

5951.119 --> 5956.96
nourish themselves slightly like eating

5953.44 --> 5959.04
mana so that they wouldn't just go out

5956.96 --> 5961.92
and hunting all day long and start

5959.04 --> 5961.92
eating everyone

5962.56 --> 5967.119000000001
right and that's even described in the

5965.199 --> 5970.08
bible post flood

5967.119 --> 5970.88
how when the flood came down whoever was

5970.08 --> 5973.119
surviving

5970.88 --> 5974.159000000001
the giants were all maniacs they would

5973.119 --> 5976.799999999999
start to eat

5974.159 --> 5976.799999999999
everybody

5977.28 --> 5980.32
why would that be well maybe because the

5979.199 --> 5983.199
flood

5980.32 --> 5983.5199999999995
destroyed all the energy generators made

5983.199 --> 5985.678999999999
them

5983.52 --> 5987.92
incapable made sure that there was no

5985.679 --> 5990.08
water stream underneath anymore

5987.92 --> 5991.1990000000005
so all that power output stopped all the

5990.08 --> 5993.04
giants got hungry

5991.199 --> 5994.879999999999
and then started eating everyone until

5993.04 --> 5998.719
they got killed

5994.88 --> 6002.8
right yeah i thought about this a lot

5998.719 --> 6002.8
it's a developed theory of mine

6005.52 --> 6009.84
steamy traveler i don't know if there is

6007.36 --> 6013.04
an antarctic ice wall

6009.84 --> 6014.96
there might be a nice barrier it

6013.04 --> 6017.199
you don't know if it was always like

6014.96 --> 6020.639
that you know

6017.199 --> 6023.04
the ice wall might might have grown

6020.639 --> 6024.96
in recent centuries and that it might

6023.04 --> 6027.199
have not even been there before that

6024.96 --> 6027.199
time

6031.84 --> 6037.84
gulliver stroller yeah

6052.56 --> 6055.679
offspring of the fallen angels yeah yeah

6054.88 --> 6059.04
yeah

6055.679 --> 6061.04
or or it's just really tough to be a

6059.04 --> 6063.679
really big giants they were just smart

6061.04 --> 6065.679
enough to fix that with technology

6063.679 --> 6067.6
that allowed them to be really big and

6065.679 --> 6070.96
still kind of benevolent

6067.6 --> 6073.1990000000005
and then it was destroyed and then

6070.96 --> 6074.0
suddenly they turned into monsters maybe

6073.199 --> 6076.879999999999
that is

6074.0 --> 6077.36
what's really going down you know i

6076.88 --> 6079.84
don't

6077.36 --> 6081.5199999999995
think that giants are per definition

6079.84 --> 6085.28
evil but i think that if they

6081.52 --> 6087.4400000000005
suffer a lot for all kinds of reasons

6085.28 --> 6089.28
then just like a human being that

6087.44 --> 6091.919999999999
suffers a lot yeah you can

6089.28 --> 6093.92
turn pretty damn dark that's right does

6091.92 --> 6094.88
that make them the offspring of the

6093.92 --> 6099.1990000000005
devil

6094.88 --> 6102.32
because of that i don't see that

6099.199 --> 6104.48
i don't see that part i think that the

6102.32 --> 6105.5199999999995
offspring of the fallen angel is not

6104.48 --> 6108.4
necessarily oh

6105.52 --> 6109.4400000000005
the giants i think or those they might

6108.4 --> 6111.44
have been

6109.44 --> 6114.32
you know i think it is the spirit is the

6111.44 --> 6118.159
spirit of psychopathy

6114.32 --> 6120.96
and yeah i have no doubt that

6118.159 --> 6123.04
back then since the giants were very

6120.96 --> 6125.52
dominant and big and could rule

6123.04 --> 6128.159
it's very likely that there were well

6125.52 --> 6129.76
psychopath giants ruling over everybody

6128.159 --> 6132.5599999999995
just like they're psychopath

6129.76 --> 6134.159000000001
humans now ruling over everyone right

6132.56 --> 6135.92
it's not because

6134.159 --> 6137.759999999999
they were giants no it's because the

6135.92 --> 6138.719
giants were just naturally more dominant

6137.76 --> 6141.4400000000005
to rule

6138.719 --> 6142.8
and they would end up like psychopaths

6141.44 --> 6145.28
or the psychopath

6142.8 --> 6147.1990000000005
one in the giants takes over because

6145.28 --> 6151.36
he's a psychopath right

6147.199 --> 6154.08
so i don't want to attribute some

6151.36 --> 6155.28
inevitable doom due to a bloodline

6154.08 --> 6160.08
because of the devil

6155.28 --> 6162.88
physically procreating in the world

6160.08 --> 6163.76
like i really dislike that story it's

6162.88 --> 6167.4400000000005
still

6163.76 --> 6167.76
relevant to keep in in mind i just don't

6167.44 --> 6170.96
think

6167.76 --> 6173.280000000001
it's very productive to think like that

6170.96 --> 6173.28
even

6174.56 --> 6178.2390000000005
you know you will know them by their

6176.639 --> 6180.08
actions

6178.239 --> 6181.919999999999
if they are acting like psychopaths

6180.08 --> 6183.76
whether they're giants

6181.92 --> 6185.84
whether they're just regular humans or

6183.76 --> 6187.119000000001
whether they're leprechaun sized it

6185.84 --> 6189.28
doesn't really matter

6187.119 --> 6190.88
only thing that really matters is their

6189.28 --> 6192.5599999999995
actions

6190.88 --> 6195.04
what did they do what spirit do they

6192.56 --> 6196.400000000001
carry within them

6195.04 --> 6198.56
what are their principles their

6196.4 --> 6202.239
objectives who taught

6198.56 --> 6202.2390000000005
them how to live

6202.96 --> 6205.84
that's the really only thing that

6204.4 --> 6219.839999999999
matters it doesn't matter what type of

6205.84 --> 6219.84
creature you are in my opinion

6230.84 --> 6233.84
so

6237.28 --> 6243.599999999999
the stuff outside of them the dome

6241.679 --> 6246.639
oh who says there is anything outside of

6243.6 --> 6250.08
the dome

6246.639 --> 6252.639
if it is even a dome i don't know what

6250.08 --> 6254.719
is outside

6252.639 --> 6256.8
currently i'm resting on the concept

6254.719 --> 6260.159
that there's simply a limited amount of

6256.8 --> 6262.320000000001
space for matter to exist within

6260.159 --> 6263.599999999999
however that space is interconnected

6262.32 --> 6266.639
with everything

6263.6 --> 6269.280000000001
within it i don't know for sure

6266.639 --> 6271.6
but i am assuming there's just simply a

6269.28 --> 6274.48
limited amount of volume for matter to

6271.6 --> 6276.96
exist within

6274.48 --> 6277.678999999999
that's what i'm assuming right now so

6276.96 --> 6280.2390000000005
there is

6277.679 --> 6282.08
not anything beyond it's simply there is

6280.239 --> 6284.159
no more physical space

6282.08 --> 6285.6
i'm assuming there is a limited amount

6284.159 --> 6289.28
of physical space

6285.6 --> 6290.2390000000005
like in its entirety it's not like oh

6289.28 --> 6291.599999999999
there's a space

6290.239 --> 6293.28
here and there's a bit of space no

6291.6 --> 6296.2390000000005
there's literally

6293.28 --> 6297.199
no more physical volume than a certain

6296.239 --> 6300.32
amount

6297.199 --> 6302.879999999999
in all of existence that's what i'm

6300.32 --> 6306.32
assuming right now

6302.88 --> 6307.1990000000005
right yeah everybody's been spoiled by

6306.32 --> 6311.5199999999995
this ideal

6307.199 --> 6313.44
idea of eternal space forever things

6311.52 --> 6317.84
yeah yeah i think that that is probably

6313.44 --> 6317.839999999999
the biggest lie of all

6320.56 --> 6327.679
physicality and unlimited

6324.56 --> 6331.84
endless amounts does not go together

6327.679 --> 6331.84
it's like it's illogical

6342.8 --> 6347.6
crystallizes on the plane of inertia

6345.28 --> 6347.599999999999
what

6353.199 --> 6359.28
there is more just not accessible

6356.88 --> 6360.4800000000005
right well look there may be

6359.28 --> 6363.84
compartments

6360.48 --> 6365.599999999999
it is a possibility right and the other

6363.84 --> 6366.08
people have addressed it too that there

6365.6 --> 6369.52
is

6366.08 --> 6371.679
indeed the inner terror

6369.52 --> 6373.6
where there might be a dome or whatever

6371.679 --> 6376.32
some kind of tunnel or a dome

6373.6 --> 6377.119000000001
something where the earth realm is

6376.32 --> 6379.28
within

6377.119 --> 6381.5199999999995
and that there's literally more room

6379.28 --> 6382.88
beyond but you can't physically get

6381.52 --> 6385.84
there

6382.88 --> 6387.6
but things can be there inherently and

6385.84 --> 6389.28
have always been there

6387.6 --> 6391.04
that there is a separate barrier and who

6389.28 --> 6393.28
knows the barrier might have been lifted

6391.04 --> 6395.76
or can be lifted

6393.28 --> 6397.5199999999995
and that it's like a realm stuck within

6395.76 --> 6400.08
another realm

6397.52 --> 6401.119000000001
but at some point there cannot be

6400.08 --> 6404.639
another realm

6401.119 --> 6407.119
within which all the other realms

6404.639 --> 6408.0
reside and there would simply be no more

6407.119 --> 6411.199
space

6408.0 --> 6414.8
for matter to exist in at some point

6411.199 --> 6416.96
has to be has to be there is no

6414.8 --> 6418.0
other option that cannot be unlimited

6416.96 --> 6429.84
physical

6418.0 --> 6429.84
it's impossible

6434.239 --> 6438.879999999999
infinite space within right yeah yeah

6436.639 --> 6439.76
well i've heard that message for a long

6438.88 --> 6441.6
time

6439.76 --> 6443.52
it's like there is no unlimited space

6441.6 --> 6457.84
outwards but there may be unlimited

6443.52 --> 6457.84
space inward

6463.21 --> 6468.109
[Music]

6477.92 --> 6481.76
matter is fake yeah yeah that's

6482.84 --> 6485.84
ridiculous

6493.199 --> 6498.799999999999
what kind of a claim is that dr gunn so

6496.159 --> 6500.96
that's ridiculous

6498.8 --> 6501.92
i think substance is definitely

6500.96 --> 6504.88
described

6501.92 --> 6513.84
in the bible and the distinction between

6504.88 --> 6513.84
physical substance and spirit

6526.639 --> 6529.6
i don't know what you're trying to

6527.76 --> 6532.08
achieve now but it's it's kind of

6529.6 --> 6532.08
annoying

6533.44 --> 6545.119
like you're saying these things not me

6541.77 --> 6547.1990000000005
[Music]

6545.119 --> 6550.799999999999
right now but steamy traveler it was

6547.199 --> 6550.799999999999
actually described in the bible

6551.44 --> 6558.32
i'm not entirely sure though but

6554.599 --> 6561.4400000000005
metaphorically a lot

6558.32 --> 6561.44
has been described

6563.199 --> 6569.119
like the idea of instant communication

6565.92 --> 6571.84
while not physically face to face

6569.119 --> 6573.598999999999
that is out there i think they have

6571.84 --> 6576.400000000001
described it

6573.599 --> 6578.719
it's just that a lot of what is written

6576.4 --> 6581.04
down is written down in a very long time

6578.719 --> 6581.04
ago

6581.28 --> 6585.199
where they did not know how to even

6584.4 --> 6589.598999999999
describe

6585.199 --> 6589.598999999999
what they were perceiving right

6591.36 --> 6595.44
they didn't understand what they were

6593.119 --> 6597.839999999999
seeing in the future

6595.44 --> 6599.919999999999
so they could only try to describe it by

6597.84 --> 6600.639
their own level of understanding of how

6599.92 --> 6611.84
things work

6600.639 --> 6611.84
at that time

6635.28 --> 6643.759999999999
now the bible is a book

6639.36 --> 6643.759999999999
testimonies and descriptions

6651.119 --> 6657.199
okay seeking star wars that will be cool

6654.639 --> 6667.84
yeah you have my email right so yeah i i

6657.199 --> 6667.839999999999
will be looking at that

6668.08 --> 6673.28
yeah well dr gonzo things like god's

6670.8 --> 6676.56
word above everything all these

6673.28 --> 6676.88
christian tropes the people that use

6676.56 --> 6678.8
that

6676.88 --> 6680.2390000000005
don't even freaking understand what

6678.8 --> 6682.719
they're saying okay they

6680.239 --> 6684.718999999999
literally don't understand what they're

6682.719 --> 6687.36
saying

6684.719 --> 6689.199
somebody says that most people they

6687.36 --> 6690.639
don't understand what that actually

6689.199 --> 6694.48
means

6690.639 --> 6698.0
so they basically reify

6694.48 --> 6699.04
things in to a on to specifics that are

6698.0 --> 6701.76
not actually

6699.04 --> 6703.76
what it means because of exoterics

6701.76 --> 6706.8
esoteric habits

6703.76 --> 6709.360000000001
right and the vatican has

6706.8 --> 6710.4800000000005
added on yeah the catholicism and all

6709.36 --> 6712.88
the priesthood has

6710.48 --> 6716.08
done a lot of that for people to latch

6712.88 --> 6716.08
on to exoterics

6719.679 --> 6723.119
no dr gonzo and you're one step away

6722.32 --> 6726.239
from getting

6723.119 --> 6726.239
a timeout

6727.04 --> 6735.679
[ __ ] no the word of god

6731.679 --> 6738.56
is a very complicated thing

6735.679 --> 6738.56
and god

6738.8 --> 6745.119000000001
being truth that part is

6742.159 --> 6748.32
literal but you don't understand unless

6745.119 --> 6751.679
you understand esoterics

6748.32 --> 6754.5599999999995
it's like the essence of it all outside

6751.679 --> 6756.0
of information as outside of the

6754.56 --> 6758.0
conscious grabbing onto

6756.0 --> 6760.239
information there is esoterics there's a

6758.0 --> 6764.0
deeper meaning that has no description

6760.239 --> 6769.119
or words

6764.0 --> 6769.119
and when you say god is truth

6769.28 --> 6772.4
it's quite literal

6772.719 --> 6776.0
now that doesn't mean that everything

6774.76 --> 6779.119000000001
associated

6776.0 --> 6781.84
by people with that is absolute truth no

6779.119 --> 6784.799999999999
the fact is the other way around

6781.84 --> 6786.719
the truth makes it god it it connects

6784.8 --> 6792.2390000000005
that power

6786.719 --> 6795.44
that is there

6792.239 --> 6797.5199999999995
right just because you associate with

6795.44 --> 6798.5599999999995
that if you don't understand it if you

6797.52 --> 6800.56
don't live it

6798.56 --> 6802.56
you can say it all you like it doesn't

6800.56 --> 6803.84
mean anything then

6802.56 --> 6806.080000000001
if you don't understand what you're

6803.84 --> 6809.1990000000005
saying then it doesn't do anything it

6806.08 --> 6821.84
just becomes a trope

6809.199 --> 6821.839999999999
a dogma

6825.119 --> 6835.839999999999
does god occupy physical space

6828.32 --> 6835.84
i don't think so

6852.719 --> 6859.28
like some i've theorized like

6856.32 --> 6859.92
the hands of creation might have been

6859.28 --> 6862.88
physical

6859.92 --> 6864.56
like the elohim they're called they

6862.88 --> 6865.679
might have been physical the hands of

6864.56 --> 6868.8
the creator

6865.679 --> 6869.599
i think that the prime architect is

6868.8 --> 6874.0
outside

6869.599 --> 6876.159000000001
of the physical realm on his throne

6874.0 --> 6877.679
in the spiritual realm above the

6876.159 --> 6891.839999999999
physical

6877.679 --> 6891.84
right as described

6894.159 --> 6898.159
all right so i'm gonna round out the

6895.84 --> 6900.8
