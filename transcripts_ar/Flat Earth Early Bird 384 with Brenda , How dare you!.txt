[Music]

31.27 --> 33.33
you

44.2 --> 51.739000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

48.41 --> 53.66
early-bird number 384 I'm your host

51.739 --> 55.519999999999996
Arwen and before we start to show please

53.66 --> 57.26
don't forget to share it on any platform

55.52 --> 59.120000000000005
you deem fit and if you haven't already

57.26 --> 60.8
subscribed to my channel and hit the

59.12 --> 62.839999999999996
bell notification so you know when I'm

60.8 --> 65.81
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

62.84 --> 68.84
Amsterdam time every day and please also

65.81 --> 71.36
do support me and my channel so the

68.84 --> 75.02000000000001
paypal patron my GoFundMe slide update

71.36 --> 76.22
and my GoFundMe and the super chats that

75.02 --> 80.24
would be much appreciated

76.22 --> 83.84
yeah about the GoFundMe I updated I I

80.24 --> 85.94
don't know how to reset the funds like

83.84 --> 88.04
they just keep on filing in you don't

85.94 --> 90.77
scratch him away or you don't out date

88.04 --> 95.80000000000001
them or anything so what I changed it

90.77 --> 98.24
updated it to a microphone arm so this

95.8 --> 99.95
nonsense doesn't happen anymore it's

98.24 --> 103.66999999999999
really annoying every time I hear that

99.95 --> 107.75
back and a microphone arm it's slightly

103.67 --> 110.319
expensive 85 euros it's well known to be

107.75 --> 114.11
expensive but it is extremely effective

110.319 --> 115.75
so I'm hoping to maybe over the course

114.11 --> 120.47
of the winter

115.75 --> 122.45
get some enthusiasm about that but we'll

120.47 --> 128.179
see at least I updated the pages so

122.45 --> 132.62
today weather is it's nice it's kind of

128.179 --> 135.17000000000002
mixed it cloudy here and there but still

132.62 --> 137.77
some nice Sun cold wind it is really

135.17 --> 137.76999999999998
cold though

140.17 --> 155.23
all right today I just got tea minty

147.23 --> 158.26999999999998
that's it so let's see who is in chat I

155.23 --> 162.38
may get Brenda on a little bit later

158.27 --> 164.33
see how my that can go anyway Tom Parker

162.38 --> 168.53
what was first I thought for a moment

164.33 --> 173.36
that YouTube had like completely caught

168.53 --> 177.05
off the entire entrance to the stream or

173.36 --> 179.99
something because yeah up until like 10

177.05 --> 182.75
minutes before to Amsterdam time there

179.99 --> 185.86
was literally only one waiting where

182.75 --> 189.32
there was probably me and I was like

185.86 --> 191.87
usually people leak in pretty early

189.32 --> 196.04
especially when I already prepare the

191.87 --> 201.4
hangout pretty early on but but yeah

196.04 --> 204.38
it's full now so welcome everyone anyway

201.4 --> 209.66
Tom Parker was first more coloured Rena

204.38 --> 212.29
from von essen silver umbrella the

209.66 --> 217.66
studio 68 8:00 a.m.

212.29 --> 217.66
Robin Stanley over moku

219.78 --> 233.97
Harry's egg hunt demanda you Peter

226.299 --> 243.37
Dostoevsky julieopp Evan 101 rock on

233.97 --> 250.03
gern Abdal and James Mason yeah good to

243.37 --> 250.51
see you all so yesterday it was just so

250.03 --> 256.989
Mimi

250.51 --> 259.81
it was crazy yeah it was we have been

256.989 --> 267.06
watching a lot of D life recently left

259.81 --> 270.61
to fail again and Owen Benjamin there's

267.06 --> 274.03000000000003
like this concert effort you could say

270.61 --> 278.44
or it's just it was meant to be the

274.03 --> 282.78
whole how dare you mean exploding out

278.44 --> 282.78
there seen such hilarious things

288.879 --> 293.129
yeah one thing in

300.13 --> 305.94
yeah from anchor bear the how dare you

304.09 --> 309.64
one hour version

305.94 --> 311.71
it's a it gets a little old after a

309.64 --> 317.53
while if you play it too long but it's

311.71 --> 323.5
just it's so amazing it's freakin

317.53 --> 325.41999999999996
hilarious I put out the Lincoln Chatham

323.5 --> 327.37
and they actually play it in the

325.42 --> 333.58000000000004
background at some point for comedic

327.37 --> 337.05
effect but anyway let's see what you

333.58 --> 337.05
guys and girls are talking about

366.45 --> 376.74
oh yeah and of course yesterday also on

370.32 --> 379.71
YouTube still grantees triggered earther

376.74 --> 383.76
of the Year awards oh my god and yeah of

379.71 --> 386.82
course I was on that I'm glad he took

383.76 --> 390.71999999999997
that particular clip which was from

386.82 --> 393.33
pretty long ago and it was that silly so

390.72 --> 395.01000000000005
yeah I totally deserve to get that

393.33 --> 397.44
smacked in my face I kind of

395.01 --> 402.08
conveniently forgot about it because it

397.44 --> 402.08
was just really silly in retrospect

410.15 --> 417.10999999999996
yeah I know it was so silly but I still

414.65 --> 419.479
remember their frustration because I was

417.11 --> 421.94
really trying to I had more energy back

419.479 --> 423.919
then in the sense that I didn't do daily

421.94 --> 426.74
shows yet but I did put in a lot of

423.919 --> 429.04999999999995
effort to really put in new subjects put

426.74 --> 431.96000000000004
it down there with a lot of energy and I

429.05 --> 434.03000000000003
yam I said something was screwing with

431.96 --> 439.31
my subscribers and trolls were screwing

434.03 --> 441.169
with it like constantly subscribing and

439.31 --> 442.52
then when I really did go and get some

441.169 --> 444.94899999999996
new subscribers they would unsubscribe

442.52 --> 447.889
and it really kind of got to me back

444.949 --> 450.83000000000004
then now it really doesn't matter too

447.889 --> 455.72
much anymore I yeah I am monetized that

450.83 --> 458.06
what that was what that was for but yeah

455.72 --> 460.43
I was so frustrated and it felt like I

458.06 --> 463.46
was getting bullied and that kind of

460.43 --> 465.53000000000003
radiates off it and it's just so silly

463.46 --> 467.21
and hilarious and especially because not

465.53 --> 470.59999999999997
too long after I got my thousand

467.21 --> 472.76
subscribers pretty quickly I almost felt

470.6 --> 474.62
like extra embarrassed like oh yeah

472.76 --> 477.65
because I did that

474.62 --> 481.7
now people subscribe because I thought

477.65 --> 484.63899999999995
it was hilarious not because because of

481.7 --> 488.5
the content other than me being silly

484.639 --> 488.5
Arwen which I am sometimes

494.02 --> 497.07
[Music]

499.159 --> 504.919
but yeah I've had plenty of pretty

502.55 --> 510.289
brutally triggered moments other than

504.919 --> 511.429
that like I thought one was I can't I

510.289 --> 514.519
wouldn't be able to find it back

511.429 --> 518.649
although I might have it download it not

514.519 --> 521.69
too sure but one point at Jose's I got

518.649 --> 524.839
usually I get really foaming at the

521.69 --> 527.089
mouth pissed off at ballers almost

524.839 --> 529.4590000000001
Nathan level in Jose's chat or in the

527.089 --> 533.75
past I'd kind of stay away from it now

529.459 --> 536.029
it's just not pleasant there but one

533.75 --> 538.79
time I got into the Hangout and then

536.029 --> 542.99
everybody started pooh-poohing on me

538.79 --> 548.389
very nastily and yeah then I went off

542.99 --> 551.66
like yeah hell-bent like pretty savagely

548.389 --> 555.069
that was triggered as well but I don't

551.66 --> 557.6
think they all the guys have seen that

555.069 --> 559.8499999999999
so that was mentioned worthy as well

557.6 --> 562.339
that wasn't just personal you know it

559.85 --> 565.759
would be stupid to have my own personal

562.339 --> 570.8290000000001
struggles that I do explain and that are

565.759 --> 575.0600000000001
really not about the outside world or

570.829 --> 577.06
other people so much concerning flat

575.06 --> 580.8499999999999
earth it first is the globe and all that

577.06 --> 582.529
to put that that up because yeah it is

580.85 --> 587.0600000000001
kind of meant to be funny and and those

582.529 --> 590.079
things are really not that funny unless

587.06 --> 590.079
your psychopath

590.44 --> 598.0500000000001
yeah yeah who is 8

594.66 --> 598.05
remember that guy

610.82 --> 622.6500000000001
yes Fyodor Dostoevsky thanks for your

615.59 --> 624.4100000000001
rendered judgment but I I think I can

622.65 --> 629.88
handle it

624.41 --> 635.99
as for the good person it's a little

629.88 --> 635.99
complicated but a shoot

644.16 --> 646.85
it's

648.28 --> 658.68
anyway yeah I was planning to get ran

651.19 --> 661.8900000000001
down just to see what's gonna happen so

658.68 --> 661.89
all right

666.71 --> 669.58
okay

673.89 --> 677.71
[Music]

678.19 --> 687.4100000000001
hello the good morning can you hear me

682.97 --> 689.84
yes I can can you hear me yes

687.41 --> 695.06
ah good talk coming through loud and

689.84 --> 700.4
clear alright ah hold on let me get try

695.06 --> 703.9599999999999
to get all the volumes right it's always

700.4 --> 705.77
a bit tricky Jack can't speak up again

703.96 --> 707.9000000000001
yes I'm right here

705.77 --> 710.36
testing one two three testing one two

707.9 --> 710.81
three all right yeah that's good that's

710.36 --> 715.73
good

710.81 --> 717.92
all right yeah so welcome Oh welcome how

715.73 --> 722.39
are you doing I'm doing pretty good

717.92 --> 728.0899999999999
actually yeah I had a bit of a late

722.39 --> 731.36
night but yeah still doing good yeah

728.09 --> 733.0400000000001
we've got lots of snow here snow you've

731.36 --> 736.88
got a couple inches couple inches of

733.04 --> 742.28
snow hmm I haven't had any snow so far

736.88 --> 744.32
over here although I had a month ago or

742.28 --> 747.56
something in France there was snow

744.32 --> 752.2600000000001
apparently and I don't know but yeah

747.56 --> 752.26
snow has avoided the Netherlands so far

752.68 --> 765.6999999999999
so and it's 22 below zero Celsius seven

759.47 --> 769.76
degrees below Fahrenheit 22 below zero

765.7 --> 772.1
zero Celsius yeah I assume that you

769.76 --> 775.79
being in Denmark you are in Celsius so

772.1 --> 779.84
yes Celsius is 22 below 8 degrees below

775.79 --> 785.3
zero by Fahrenheit over there holy that

779.84 --> 791.99
is incredibly cold that's like it's

785.3 --> 795.5899999999999
Minnesota oh right right yeah that yeah

791.99 --> 799.49
that can get very cold it's just like my

795.59 --> 802.1
buddy mark he's oh yeah he's kind of

799.49 --> 803.87
homesteaded and he also has a lot of

802.1 --> 805.34
work like getting the snow and the ice

803.87 --> 808.0600000000001
out of the way preventing

805.34 --> 811.7
things from breaking down from freezing

808.06 --> 815.0
so and that's also somewhere in that in

811.7 --> 823.5500000000001
in the north in the Mid North I think

815.0 --> 827.17
right is Minnesota yes where yes yeah

823.55 --> 830.81
can't get very cold at winter over there

827.17 --> 833.9
so I hope all your heating is a is all

830.81 --> 834.14
working yeah it's fine it's fine thank

833.9 --> 836.87
you

834.14 --> 839.42
so yeah anything other than the weather

836.87 --> 841.55
you want to talk about coming on my show

839.42 --> 842.8
well I've been going on I've been going

841.55 --> 847.3399999999999
on

842.8 --> 850.9399999999999
Nathan's after show a bit I think those

847.34 --> 857.0300000000001
have been good I have won every debate

850.94 --> 861.2
I've ever had with Nathan Oakley say

857.03 --> 864.4599999999999
again I have won every debate I've ever

861.2 --> 869.75
had with Nathan or quantum eraser or

864.46 --> 875.84
frankly any flat earther some okay what

869.75 --> 878.2
did you win yeah I won the debate you

875.84 --> 881.72
know I'm right that's what I mean right

878.2 --> 885.85
about rise right about what that the

881.72 --> 889.7900000000001
earth is flat is round it's not flat

885.85 --> 892.49
gravity is real all those things

889.79 --> 894.62
there's yes of course it is okay all

892.49 --> 897.17
those things oh that's hot how do you

894.62 --> 899.96
know what is it if it's real because

897.17 --> 903.65
it's true because it's true yeah but

899.96 --> 906.86
what is true do you understand what what

903.65 --> 909.4399999999999
is true how do you know yes I didn't

906.86 --> 914.0
understand I don't know I'm asking how

909.44 --> 916.19
do you know it is true what is it that

914.0 --> 920.36
just how do I know that the that the

916.19 --> 925.4300000000001
earth is in fact a globe no grandpa does

920.36 --> 929.39
oh yeah you just said it's true it's

925.43 --> 933.05
there so but like with the globe earth

929.39 --> 935.84
okay at least we get what it's supposed

933.05 --> 937.76
to be what is supposed to be what with

935.84 --> 940.07
gravity however

937.76 --> 942.29
there's more problems than just that

940.07 --> 945.95
just making a stance the problem is is

942.29 --> 949.13
that the good in the globe system it's

945.95 --> 953.2
not really too well understood what it

949.13 --> 957.5
really is what it does how it ties in

953.2 --> 959.3000000000001
because look in the whole body of

957.5 --> 962.11
science and all the developments in

959.3 --> 969.2299999999999
astrophysics even though there's a a

962.11 --> 971.51
mismatch in the base of it well yeah one

969.23 --> 974.9300000000001
gravity and then there's Newtonian

971.51 --> 976.97
gravity and they don't match up

974.93 --> 979.8499999999999
they don't have actually connect they

976.97 --> 982.4
they can be said like oh yeah this it

979.85 --> 984.7
does that this is that but there's

982.4 --> 987.11
technically not really a connect

984.7 --> 989.69
yeah there's that's not a problem oh

987.11 --> 992.27
really right how is that not a problem

989.69 --> 994.2800000000001
so they're those things that are

992.27 --> 997.01
completely different in the foundation

994.28 --> 999.14
and it yeah you could just say it's the

997.01 --> 1004.03
same but how where does it actually

999.14 --> 1007.4399999999999
connect because it doesn't work well one

1004.03 --> 1011.89
is a description of how gravity actually

1007.44 --> 1015.6400000000001
behaves and the other Einstein's theory

1011.89 --> 1017.59
of relativity is an attempt at a theory

1015.64 --> 1021.28
that would that would explain how

1017.59 --> 1023.5600000000001
gravity actually works so there's a

1021.28 --> 1026.23
difference between an explanation so

1023.56 --> 1029.29
laws don't really explain things they

1026.23 --> 1032.35
describe things and then theories

1029.29 --> 1035.53
attempt to explain the observations that

1032.35 --> 1038.05
we make and so there's really no problem

1035.53 --> 1039.8799999999999
there's really no product nose yeah but

1038.05 --> 1042.61
that's just speculation that's all

1039.88 --> 1046.0
speculation that's not really scientific

1042.61 --> 1049.1799999999998
theory you know the foundation of these

1046.0 --> 1054.76
things are all based in actual empirical

1049.18 --> 1058.24
data where you interact with the

1054.76 --> 1060.07
phenomenon you know to change yeah yeah

1058.24 --> 1062.71
but yeah we were like out about it where

1060.07 --> 1065.6799999999998
do you do that well you pick up a pencil

1062.71 --> 1068.29
and you drop it and it falls that's

1065.68 --> 1070.7
gravity yeah but how are you influencing

1068.29 --> 1073.82
the phenomena that causes this

1070.7 --> 1077.48
because it is but you don't just things

1073.82 --> 1080.9299999999998
drop stuff and other things go up right

1077.48 --> 1084.25
so how are you manipulating the

1080.93 --> 1087.41
phenomena not an object that is

1084.25 --> 1090.31
supposedly in this phenomena in this

1087.41 --> 1092.63
field present right how are you actually

1090.31 --> 1095.9199999999998
influencing the field in order to

1092.63 --> 1099.38
establish empirically that it is there

1095.92 --> 1102.3500000000001
because interacting with objects that's

1099.38 --> 1104.3600000000001
something that you presuppose those

1102.35 --> 1108.49
objects are being subjected to it it

1104.36 --> 1111.2299999999998
doesn't influence the actual phenomenon

1108.49 --> 1114.23
what we don't presuppose it we observe

1111.23 --> 1116.84
it you pick up a pencil and you drop it

1114.23 --> 1119.0
that's a gravity that's the phenomenon

1116.84 --> 1120.9499999999998
that we seek to describe and to explain

1119.0 --> 1122.75
and so then what you can do from there

1120.95 --> 1124.82
is you could tell no but you're not

1122.75 --> 1127.31
actually changing the phenomena

1124.82 --> 1129.49
you're just displacing stuff and it's

1127.31 --> 1132.59
being subjected to this placement as

1129.49 --> 1135.68
works naturally in this realm up and

1132.59 --> 1137.78
down depending on their density that's

1135.68 --> 1141.53
essentially dose available in empirical

1137.78 --> 1144.1299999999999
base based reasoning density doesn't

1141.53 --> 1147.77
have anything to do with gravity Arwen I

1144.13 --> 1150.2900000000002
know that's why it works because it

1147.77 --> 1154.07
doesn't need gravity in order to explain

1150.29 --> 1156.29
the phenomena and actually interact it

1154.07 --> 1158.96
allows you to actually manipulate the

1156.29 --> 1162.23
phenomena you can actually change

1158.96 --> 1164.66
dentist densities which is the ground

1162.23 --> 1166.52
for the cause of the displacement the

1164.66 --> 1170.1200000000001
density in relation to the rest of the

1166.52 --> 1172.1299999999999
dance so you can change that correlation

1170.12 --> 1174.08
between the medium and the density by

1172.13 --> 1176.0300000000002
replacing it or introducing some other

1174.08 --> 1178.55
substance that change the average

1176.03 --> 1181.46
density and then displacement will

1178.55 --> 1182.93
engage accordingly this is all based in

1181.46 --> 1186.95
empirical data it doesn't require

1182.93 --> 1189.5600000000002
gravity and you don't really the

1186.95 --> 1191.95
dropping things does not prove gravity

1189.56 --> 1195.8899999999999
according to size because you're not

1191.95 --> 1197.81
changing the presupposed for this

1195.89 --> 1200.24
equilibrium field but you should check

1197.81 --> 1202.01
it is right that would mechanically make

1200.24 --> 1203.2
it work but you can't alter it you can

1202.01 --> 1206.86
point at it

1203.2 --> 1209.5
you can't actually a self catch that it

1206.86 --> 1211.81
is there through science yes yes we can

1209.5 --> 1213.01
no you can't done it hundreds of years

1211.81 --> 1215.1399999999999
ago it's been done

1213.01 --> 1217.78
what density doesn't explain anything

1215.14 --> 1221.0200000000002
are with us yes yes I just explained it

1217.78 --> 1223.17
to you I just explained settlers but now

1221.02 --> 1227.2
I don't know how you gave an explanation

1223.17 --> 1229.75
step by step no how did you end it

1227.2 --> 1231.88
elated how you adapt to the actual

1229.75 --> 1236.05
scientific method that's not just words

1231.88 --> 1237.96
that's a grounded based explanation

1236.05 --> 1240.3
based in important core identity

1237.96 --> 1244.0
scientists what is density Carwin

1240.3 --> 1248.1
density is the falou make mass it's the

1244.0 --> 1252.88
relation between a certain volume and

1248.1 --> 1254.9199999999998
the mass of the substance within yeah

1252.88 --> 1260.17
yeah it's the mountain it's amount of

1254.92 --> 1263.2
mass per cubic measurements whether it's

1260.17 --> 1265.99
cubic centimeter cubic meter cubic mile

1263.2 --> 1267.82
yeah all right and so that doesn't that

1265.99 --> 1271.39
doesn't do anything that doesn't cause

1267.82 --> 1274.99
anything it in itself doesn't do

1271.39 --> 1277.69
anything it is a relation between its

1274.99 --> 1281.38
density and the medium it is in it's no

1277.69 --> 1285.1000000000001
it's not a relation yes yes that is what

1281.38 --> 1287.8200000000002
that system is grounded in specifically

1285.1 --> 1291.34
as mentioned in every single explanation

1287.82 --> 1293.32
specifically the relation between the

1291.34 --> 1298.3899999999999
density of an object and the density of

1293.32 --> 1303.55
its medium that had nothing with all of

1298.39 --> 1307.0600000000002
the displacements yes Arwen a thing has

1303.55 --> 1310.27
density regardless of what medium it's

1307.06 --> 1313.75
in yes it does yes so there's no

1310.27 --> 1316.42
relation going on yes that's all yes no

1313.75 --> 1318.25
that that's complete that doesn't make

1316.42 --> 1321.16
any sense what you just said you're just

1318.25 --> 1324.54
narrowing it I understand is a relation

1321.16 --> 1328.3300000000002
and that relation is what causes the

1324.54 --> 1331.0
displacements no yes it doesn't yes it

1328.33 --> 1333.6999999999998
does provably so demonstratively so why

1331.0 --> 1335.89
don't you go over to Riley's he has tons

1333.7 --> 1338.98
and tons of demonstrations

1335.89 --> 1340.8090000000002
right it's a fool and a clown but it

1338.98 --> 1343.21
doesn't matter what his character is

1340.809 --> 1345.549
like and what his opinions are he

1343.21 --> 1349.6000000000001
actually did the physical demonstration

1345.549 --> 1352.809
he did the experiments yeah yeah yeah so

1349.6 --> 1354.9089999999999
that makes it experimentally viable a

1352.809 --> 1358.09
viable hypothesis confirmed by

1354.909 --> 1359.5900000000001
experiment scientifically viable Arwen

1358.09 --> 1362.82
relative density theory is

1359.59 --> 1366.6399999999999
scientifically viable gravity is not

1362.82 --> 1369.25
well we've we've positively done

1366.64 --> 1371.98
experiments with gravity what what Riley

1369.25 --> 1375.94
did is something that five-year-olds do

1371.98 --> 1378.039
oh this is something that five-year-olds

1375.94 --> 1380.3500000000001
talk about the egg think somebody put an

1378.039 --> 1381.8799999999999
egg put an egg in in some water and add

1380.35 --> 1384.73
some salt to it that's something that

1381.88 --> 1387.25
five-year-olds can do yeah this is not

1384.73 --> 1389.6490000000001
yeah that's why that's why it's so great

1387.25 --> 1392.35
because it's so easy to do the

1389.649 --> 1394.6
complicate the complicatedness of an

1392.35 --> 1401.11
experiment is actually a detriment to

1394.6 --> 1402.85
its to its to its work because if it's

1401.11 --> 1403.6899999999998
very can I finish please if it's very

1402.85 --> 1407.08
simple

1403.69 --> 1410.799
and a kid can do it that makes it all

1407.08 --> 1412.6299999999999
the more viable because hey you can if

1410.799 --> 1415.24
you really disagree with it try to

1412.63 --> 1418.269
disprove it will try to go ahead go

1415.24 --> 1419.6490000000001
ahead I don't I haven't ever even seen a

1418.269 --> 1422.38
baller really tried to demonstrate

1419.649 --> 1424.9599999999998
against the stalk around and say no it

1422.38 --> 1428.529
is gravity and then they don't back up

1424.96 --> 1430.48
their assertion we do that there are

1428.529 --> 1433.21
hundreds and thousands of experiments on

1430.48 --> 1436.419
gravity done every day in universities

1433.21 --> 1439.1200000000001
around the around the globe around the

1436.419 --> 1441.25
globe students yeah yeah well microphone

1439.12 --> 1443.9189999999999
dropping a rock dropping and all that is

1441.25 --> 1446.11
not actually changing the independent

1443.919 --> 1449.289
variable which is presumed to be gravity

1446.11 --> 1451.12
you're not actually changing the gravity

1449.289 --> 1453.25
which you presume to be the cause no

1451.12 --> 1456.1
you're changing something that you

1453.25 --> 1459.789
presume is being subjected to it that is

1456.1 --> 1461.3799999999999
not actually changing gravity in order

1459.789 --> 1463.269
to establish that is really you're not

1461.38 --> 1465.49
you're not interactive

1463.269 --> 1468.68
you're not interacting with it you're

1465.49 --> 1472.46
just letting stuff be subjected with too

1468.68 --> 1474.92
you presume to be there yeah the way

1472.46 --> 1477.02
science is done are when is you you make

1474.92 --> 1479.51
observations and you have a form of

1477.02 --> 1482.03
hypothesis and you then you test the

1479.51 --> 1484.76
hypothesis you take the measurement

1482.03 --> 1486.86
ation but yeah yeah by vector acting

1484.76 --> 1490.34
remember with the independent variable

1486.86 --> 1497.6
they presume to be cause yeah that's how

1490.34 --> 1501.4299999999998
anybody so the way it's team the

1497.6 --> 1505.24
Cavendish experiments conclusively shows

1501.43 --> 1508.76
what the value of little G is

1505.24 --> 1512.93
gravitational constant let's go off to

1508.76 --> 1517.82
these days benders Air Force you can

1512.93 --> 1522.29
think of it as a force of space-time

1517.82 --> 1524.51
yeah is it force or is it an effect you

1522.29 --> 1526.67
can think of it as a fourtner's you can

1524.51 --> 1531.77
describe force or is in effect it's one

1526.67 --> 1535.6100000000001
of the other you know that you

1531.77 --> 1538.61
understand that an effect can have a

1535.61 --> 1541.28
prior cause and then that effect can be

1538.61 --> 1543.56
the cause to another effect right right

1541.28 --> 1545.78
so then the answer would be it would be

1543.56 --> 1549.95
a colles then wouldn't it so what what

1545.78 --> 1554.21
happens what happens our Riley is that

1549.95 --> 1557.0800000000002
mass causes spacetime to bend and that's

1554.21 --> 1560.45
the effect of it which in turn causes

1557.08 --> 1563.4199999999998
other objects within that gravitational

1560.45 --> 1565.01
field tomorrow right so in the Cavendish

1563.42 --> 1566.48
experiment did they manipulate bendy

1565.01 --> 1567.52
space time to make the objects move

1566.48 --> 1571.85
towards each other

1567.52 --> 1575.78
because that's what they are is that the

1571.85 --> 1579.35
mass does that so they they altered the

1575.78 --> 1581.24
distance between the the the spheres the

1579.35 --> 1585.8899999999999
way that's that's not manipulating the

1581.24 --> 1587.99
presumed cause independence hey if I may

1585.89 --> 1591.38
for a second I mean that's my show I can

1587.99 --> 1593.63
do this I can interrupt right so look if

1591.38 --> 1595.5200000000002
if you really want to presume that mass

1593.63 --> 1598.1000000000001
is supposedly the cause of this

1595.52 --> 1600.19
attraction right of this gravity well

1598.1 --> 1602.34
why wasn't the Cavendish experiment

1600.19 --> 1603.9
which is not even in the next

1602.34 --> 1605.76
to prove gravity in the first place but

1603.9 --> 1607.5900000000001
just balls being interacted see what not

1605.76 --> 1609.6299999999999
no no it's not no it's not no that

1607.59 --> 1611.76
wasn't the hypothesis no it wasn't no

1609.63 --> 1615.1200000000001
yes well actually what stopped Randa I

1611.76 --> 1617.1
wasn't certain I would like to continue

1615.12 --> 1620.039
my explanation now and not get

1617.1 --> 1622.1999999999998
sidetracked to this right ok so in order

1620.039 --> 1626.1589999999999
to if you would like to prove that then

1622.2 --> 1628.1100000000001
you should alter the masses not just a

1626.159 --> 1630.029
bigger ball smaller ball no you should

1628.11 --> 1631.86
scale it up big time

1630.029 --> 1634.44
because the bigger it is the more

1631.86 --> 1638.52
powerful they suppose a pole should

1634.44 --> 1642.72
become okay yeah less and less and hold

1638.52 --> 1645.3899999999999
on hold on unless like officially is

1642.72 --> 1648.059
kind of declared erection that's why

1645.39 --> 1651.5700000000002
it's not used officially as an argument

1648.059 --> 1655.5
for gravity because the actual pole was

1651.57 --> 1658.83
technically so insignificant that yeah

1655.5 --> 1661.08
the scale didn't really effectively

1658.83 --> 1664.26
matter it would get in the way of the

1661.08 --> 1666.75
motion it would get yes weight was

1664.26 --> 1669.75
bigger so it doesn't hold any weights

1666.75 --> 1671.39
pun intended actually does it's the the

1669.75 --> 1673.38
Cavendish experiment is done by

1671.39 --> 1675.5900000000001
engineering students and science

1673.38 --> 1682.44
students in almost every University

1675.59 --> 1685.4289999999999
around the globe what what you vary is

1682.44 --> 1687.26
the distance between the two sets of

1685.429 --> 1690.929
spheres

1687.26 --> 1693.21
yeah what was the distance of suppose

1690.929 --> 1695.0700000000002
that gravity is supposed to be

1693.21 --> 1701.22
incredible it's supposed to reach up

1695.07 --> 1704.73
hundreds miles or more yes yes so then

1701.22 --> 1707.97
like you say this micro distance that

1704.73 --> 1711.289
shouldn't have any effect in the besides

1707.97 --> 1713.94
its changing the distance is not a valid

1711.289 --> 1717.899
independent variable for an experiment

1713.94 --> 1722.52
you gotta actually change the thing that

1717.899 --> 1725.1
is causing on it not a distance so Arwen

1722.52 --> 1728.01
if I want to measure mass or the gravity

1725.1 --> 1731.1299999999999
or something if I want to measure the

1728.01 --> 1733.83
strength of a magnet the way I would do

1731.13 --> 1734.89
that is by bearing the distance from the

1733.83 --> 1736.299
magnet

1734.89 --> 1738.49
to the to the thing that's being

1736.299 --> 1741.01
attracted by the magnet right I know but

1738.49 --> 1742.69
there's a sitting difference there

1741.01 --> 1745.48
there's a succinct difference

1742.69 --> 1749.049
no that is that magnetism is can be

1745.48 --> 1751.8700000000001
proven physically that is actually a

1749.049 --> 1755.62
force of gravity the exact same way or

1751.87 --> 1759.07
no no it's not by varying the distance

1755.62 --> 1762.78
between the objects just like in

1759.07 --> 1765.9399999999998
magnetism the strength of the field

1762.78 --> 1769.0
depent is a function of the distance

1765.94 --> 1771.99
between the two objects with the kavanah

1769.0 --> 1776.049
set up and how that rotation even works

1771.99 --> 1778.48
you know you can even exclude that it

1776.049 --> 1781.15
could be like static electricity for

1778.48 --> 1783.549
starters or whatever them balls are like

1781.15 --> 1787.72
they're there they use metal ball so

1783.549 --> 1790.51
there could be magnetical rigging they

1787.72 --> 1792.84
use only issues led weights they can use

1790.51 --> 1800.95
lead weights you can use non-magnetic

1792.84 --> 1804.37
materials Arwen there's no static it's a

1800.95 --> 1809.22
very finicky experiment and it's very

1804.37 --> 1809.2199999999998
needs to be very attention to detail

1809.7 --> 1815.3500000000001
these results are not that

1812.08 --> 1817.99
straightforward unless it's rigged yes

1815.35 --> 1821.83
it's a difficult experiment to pull off

1817.99 --> 1825.33
it's it's hard because they're they cost

1821.83 --> 1829.3899999999999
results and to be kind of inconclusive

1825.33 --> 1834.52
50/50 which puts it on the scale of yeah

1829.39 --> 1836.44
random for hundreds of years now Arwen

1834.52 --> 1838.24
and people it's not people are getting

1836.44 --> 1840.5800000000002
the results it's something that students

1838.24 --> 1843.34
do in in university all the time

1840.58 --> 1845.62
so Brenda given the current science for

1843.34 --> 1849.76
gravity is not a force

1845.62 --> 1852.4289999999999
why do you dismiss Einstein I don't

1849.76 --> 1853.6299999999999
dismiss Einstein but he said it wasn't a

1852.429 --> 1856.0590000000002
force but you're telling us that

1853.63 --> 1857.65
students all over the globe do this test

1856.059 --> 1860.71
all the time to make a defense of

1857.65 --> 1863.2
gravity but gravity is not a force but

1860.71 --> 1866.23
it can be it can be treated as if it's a

1863.2 --> 1868.3600000000001
force because the equations under

1866.23 --> 1872.049
nonrelativistic

1868.36 --> 1874.51
situations balance out to be equivalent

1872.049 --> 1877.029
to Newton's equations okay so I

1874.51 --> 1879.309
basically interact with something that

1877.029 --> 1882.25
you can think of is a force but isn't

1879.309 --> 1884.71
how do you interact with that because

1882.25 --> 1887.2
Einstein's equations now there's no

1884.71 --> 1889.539
non-traveling how do you interact with

1887.2 --> 1892.0900000000001
something that you can think of as a

1889.539 --> 1895.6
force but isn't how do you interact with

1892.09 --> 1899.25
that how does it interact just by

1895.6 --> 1899.25
picking up a pencil and letting it go

1900.57 --> 1905.35
you're presuming it is a force if you

1903.22 --> 1908.59
presume that that displacement that

1905.35 --> 1910.389
happens is caused by a force force field

1908.59 --> 1915.4599999999998
is of this equilibrium present at all

1910.389 --> 1918.399
times then you are actually assuming

1915.46 --> 1921.519
that is gravity causing a force well

1918.399 --> 1924.1899999999998
Einstein said it's not it's not hey and

1921.519 --> 1926.59
you can think of it as it is that it is

1924.19 --> 1930.039
but it's not it's not a force so it's a

1926.59 --> 1933.34
mystery it's a fantasy your example of

1930.039 --> 1937.6
dropping things is a fantasy no it's not

1933.34 --> 1940.809
as it is it is by Einsteins declaration

1937.6 --> 1944.049
it is you can think of whatever but it

1940.809 --> 1946.96
is no it's not yes always it are we are

1944.049 --> 1949.539
when I said that gravity can be

1946.96 --> 1951.429
considered a force yeah but it isn't you

1949.539 --> 1951.8799999999999
can consider a lot of things what it

1951.429 --> 1955.269
isn't

1951.88 --> 1958.179
I admit that so how can you then Shlaim

1955.269 --> 1960.909
that displacement tying in with forces

1958.179 --> 1962.8890000000001
is caused by it when gravity is not a

1960.909 --> 1965.6490000000001
force even though you can think of it as

1962.889 --> 1969.1899999999998
such it's not how so how are you tying

1965.649 --> 1973.2399999999998
that in would you like me to explain it

1969.19 --> 1977.3400000000001
yeah okay because Newton's equations

1973.24 --> 1980.5
that describe the bending of space-time

1977.34 --> 1982.6
reduces to I'm sorry Einstein's

1980.5 --> 1985.029
equations describing the bending of

1982.6 --> 1987.809
space-time reduced to Newton's equations

1985.029 --> 1991.269
when you're not traveling a significant

1987.809 --> 1993.7
percentage of the speed of light okay so

1991.269 --> 1996.01
it was just equals four and one plus

1993.7 --> 1998.6490000000001
three also a cause for design of

1996.01 --> 2002.22
considered to be true these aren't these

1998.649 --> 2005.6689999999999
aren't two and two yes Robin

2002.22 --> 2014.159
these are complex Tony these are tents

2005.669 --> 2016.1100000000001
this is tensor calculus yes Erica we

2014.159 --> 2016.98
don't need to drown ourselves in math

2016.11 --> 2019.86
nonsense

2016.98 --> 2022.1100000000001
thank you very much the description of

2019.86 --> 2025.62
reality yeah but if we don't care about

2022.11 --> 2029.4189999999999
descriptions we want some proof we want

2025.62 --> 2033.149
empirical proof yes we have it we have

2029.419 --> 2036.48
no you don't can you have empirical

2033.149 --> 2039.0
proof based on something being a force

2036.48 --> 2041.46
by you assuming that it is a force when

2039.0 --> 2043.559
in actuality it isn't a force it

2041.46 --> 2045.96
officially heard a four so why are you

2043.559 --> 2049.05
claiming that these things

2045.96 --> 2051.54
I'm not lacing it's a force is caused by

2049.05 --> 2054.1490000000003
gravity when gravity is not a force in

2051.54 --> 2055.619
order to displace these nuts I mean our

2054.149 --> 2059.0989999999997
gravity is a force

2055.619 --> 2061.589
Arwen listen to me you are my drawing

2059.099 --> 2064.139
things that is a claim look the

2061.589 --> 2066.359
displacement it were dropping right the

2064.139 --> 2068.6690000000003
dropping the displacement is caused by

2066.359 --> 2071.0099999999998
gravity so you're claiming a

2068.669 --> 2073.0789999999997
displacement is caused by gravity so

2071.01 --> 2075.4500000000003
that yeah basically claiming it is a

2073.079 --> 2079.1690000000003
force because no ours causes

2075.45 --> 2082.0789999999997
displacement yes yes Myranda force

2079.169 --> 2086.19
causes displacement that's therefore

2082.079 --> 2090.03
must be a force then right no Arwen just

2086.19 --> 2092.79
proved gravity no no but it is a force

2090.03 --> 2094.23
it isn't a force that's the issue yeah

2092.79 --> 2096.45
there's some force there there is a

2094.23 --> 2098.73
force there I know I know it's caused by

2096.45 --> 2101.5499999999997
relative density disequilibrium that's

2098.73 --> 2104.16
the cause of a force yes right your

2101.55 --> 2106.53
gravity is not a force you can think of

2104.16 --> 2109.44
it as a force but I do not say it's not

2106.53 --> 2113.13
a force so Arwen show me something

2109.44 --> 2115.849
displacing is not proof for your gravity

2113.13 --> 2117.9
because your gravity is in the force I

2115.849 --> 2120.69
never said it was

2117.9 --> 2123.63
Arwen but that's what you're trying to

2120.69 --> 2126.7200000000003
demonstrate unless you are if you drop

2123.63 --> 2128.67
something that's the sensor displacement

2126.72 --> 2132.24
you claim that is caused by gravity so

2128.67 --> 2134.76
you are well aiming a force I'm no I'm

2132.24 --> 2136.0499999999997
claiming that the displacement is caused

2134.76 --> 2139.8300000000004
by the bending of

2136.05 --> 2141.78
base time which can be described or

2139.83 --> 2143.49
thought of as a force

2141.78 --> 2144.8100000000004
no no it's that's thought of as a

2143.49 --> 2146.6699999999996
calculation it's not a cause-and-effect

2144.81 --> 2148.86
relationship it's a calculation in

2146.67 --> 2152.67
relationship it is a cause-and-effect

2148.86 --> 2155.7000000000003
the bending of space-time causes things

2152.67 --> 2158.07
to move noble space times a conceptual

2155.7 --> 2162.12
medium the only existence mine though

2158.07 --> 2164.1000000000004
it's not mine is real physical part of

2162.12 --> 2166.1099999999997
the universe it isn't it's a conceptual

2164.1 --> 2168.5699999999997
medium that I only exists in Einstein's

2166.11 --> 2172.44
mind and it is expressed truthfully

2168.57 --> 2176.76
that's not true it's true it's no it's

2172.44 --> 2179.64
not true space-time is is part of the

2176.76 --> 2183.7200000000003
physical universe it's it's a game it's

2179.64 --> 2186.5699999999997
not physical Brenda please tell me how

2183.72 --> 2192.8399999999997
much time fits in a cubic meter okay how

2186.57 --> 2196.29
much T in a cubic meter time not an

2192.84 --> 2199.4300000000003
object traveling within that space but

2196.29 --> 2204.96
the cubic meter itself how much time

2199.43 --> 2207.48
time not proximity or time within a

2204.96 --> 2209.13
cubic meter tell me that that is

2207.48 --> 2212.16
something that you need to resolve in

2209.13 --> 2215.78
order to start and proof that space-time

2212.16 --> 2221.16
is real what is the actual name claims

2215.78 --> 2225.2400000000002
so it's tangible I'm so time is simply

2221.16 --> 2228.1499999999996
the speed of causality that's not an

2225.24 --> 2230.04
answer to the question it is you know

2228.15 --> 2233.1600000000003
it's not an answer to the question I'm

2230.04 --> 2236.73
not asking what time is I'm asking you

2233.16 --> 2240.24
how much time is in a cubic meter yeah

2236.73 --> 2242.88
not the what time supposedly is how much

2240.24 --> 2246.1499999999996
time it's a how much question how much

2242.88 --> 2248.76
time is in a cubic meter well what time

2246.15 --> 2251.07
is measured in seconds so it would be

2248.76 --> 2254.4
the amount of time it takes you to get

2251.07 --> 2256.23
from point A to point B so time is an

2254.4 --> 2259.37
answer to the question I'm not asking

2256.23 --> 2264.36
instance question I'm asking how much

2259.37 --> 2267.8399999999997
quantitative time fits in a cubic meter

2264.36 --> 2270.07
we see are when the word is space time

2267.84 --> 2273.75
there are two two things together

2270.07 --> 2277.9
they're together space and time are

2273.75 --> 2281.68
intrinsically linked together so time is

2277.9 --> 2285.1
simply a distance that light travels and

2281.68 --> 2291.85
and that an event a can cause event B

2285.1 --> 2293.83
that's what time is I yeah I don't know

2291.85 --> 2295.87
what to do with this [ __ ] anymore it's

2293.83 --> 2297.61
just so everything that's just no you're

2295.87 --> 2299.56
not answering the question you're just

2297.61 --> 2301.3900000000003
spinning more [ __ ] I'm just giving

2299.56 --> 2303.07
you the criterion you're giving me the

2301.39 --> 2304.18
claims I know but you're not answering

2303.07 --> 2307.8700000000003
the question

2304.18 --> 2310.66
I told you specifically not to tell me

2307.87 --> 2314.0099999999998
something about a distance between

2310.66 --> 2317.17
objects I asked you a numerical

2314.01 --> 2323.8
quantitative question about how much

2317.17 --> 2326.98
time physical substance time fits in a

2323.8 --> 2331.42
cubic metre a very specific defined

2326.98 --> 2335.14
amount of space yeah so I'm not asking

2331.42 --> 2338.91
about the transit of some things within

2335.14 --> 2344.7999999999997
a freaking cubic meter I'm asking a

2338.91 --> 2345.46
quantitative amount of time in a cubic

2344.8 --> 2350.2000000000003
meter

2345.46 --> 2352.87
don't don't red herring me again but

2350.2 --> 2355.5099999999998
that's what the word space-time means it

2352.87 --> 2358.87
has to not ask you to explain the

2355.51 --> 2362.0200000000004
meaning of things I'm asking you to

2358.87 --> 2367.48
answer the question a quantitative

2362.02 --> 2369.4
amount of time in a cubic metre it it's

2367.48 --> 2372.13
the amount of time it would take light

2369.4 --> 2374.1600000000003
to travel between point a and point B in

2372.13 --> 2377.25
order for the event

2374.16 --> 2377.25
[Music]

2388.05 --> 2406.6000000000004
[Music]

2402.09 --> 2410.86
see anyway yeah I'm done with that [ __ ]

2406.6 --> 2412.71
she I'm not she was gonna go on and on

2410.86 --> 2419.86
and make me blow out my voice probably

2412.71 --> 2424.2
because she's a repulsive person very

2419.86 --> 2427.78
very much so but yeah it was good to

2424.2 --> 2434.35
have her uninterrupted and clearly put

2427.78 --> 2435.9100000000003
our out her total delusional crap here

2434.35 --> 2438.36
on this show so everybody could take a

2435.91 --> 2438.3599999999997
good look

2443.43 --> 2446.8999999999996
finally some peace and quiet

2451.23 --> 2460.5
attorneys having a field day with her

2453.45 --> 2465.839
probably but anyway yeah I thought it

2460.5 --> 2469.589
was the interesting but now I'm not

2465.839 --> 2471.15
ragequitting I'm just you know it was

2469.589 --> 2474.0299999999997
just gonna be the same [ __ ] over and

2471.15 --> 2478.44
over and over again you know I was

2474.03 --> 2482.0400000000004
extremely specific and ever warning down

2478.44 --> 2485.39
red herring me again no explanations I

2482.04 --> 2488.88
want a quantitative amount and yeah but

2485.39 --> 2490.799
she can't just answer that question she

2488.88 --> 2493.67
has to give us an explanation that's

2490.799 --> 2493.67
about something else

2499.38 --> 2508.529
No

2501.66 --> 2510.8089999999997
I'm not gonna invite Bob well maybe

2508.529 --> 2514.039
maybe at some point I will but yeah

2510.809 --> 2516.809
after this I need a little break it

2514.039 --> 2519.529
because otherwise they're just gonna get

2516.809 --> 2519.529
on my nerves

2532.22 --> 2539.8689999999997
yes para music tough isn't it yeah

2535.64 --> 2541.73
that's yeah I just pay very careful

2539.869 --> 2547.21
attention to the things that really

2541.73 --> 2547.21
matter and I've taken it upon me to

2547.93 --> 2555.46
scientifically reconstruct a more

2550.819 --> 2559.0389999999998
scientifically based approach of

2555.46 --> 2562.01
cosmogony of this realm so and I take

2559.039 --> 2566.75
great pride in the precision in getting

2562.01 --> 2568.8190000000004
things right so yeah you can say I'm the

2566.75 --> 2571.7
arbiter of all knowledge well compared

2568.819 --> 2576.2599999999998
to you guys you ballers oh yeah I am I

2571.7 --> 2578.99
am I absolutely am I get your freaking

2576.26 --> 2583.46
knowledge your model and the problems

2578.99 --> 2587.24
and even the potential solutions so much

2583.46 --> 2592.819
more clear than any of you ball tarts

2587.24 --> 2596.5389999999998
and that's not gonna change no matter

2592.819 --> 2600.97
how much spin doctoring you do to try to

2596.539 --> 2605.2990000000004
run around answering questions straight

2600.97 --> 2608.1189999999997
it's just gonna get worse so yeah it's

2605.299 --> 2611.21
very painful it's very painful to see

2608.119 --> 2615.4900000000002
that somebody that's not on your ball

2611.21 --> 2620.119
train all right not going with the globe

2615.49 --> 2624.319
that actually can be very direct very

2620.119 --> 2627.77
precise it's very tough so then you're

2624.319 --> 2629.779
gonna have to like put some dark shade

2627.77 --> 2631.73
on my character in the comments there of

2629.779 --> 2635.51
people that are usually kind of neutral

2631.73 --> 2637.789
because they are like puppets they're

2635.51 --> 2641.8390000000004
normal people sometimes and then you

2637.789 --> 2646.25
subject them to well and kind of adult

2641.839 --> 2649.279
level of stress pointing that what they

2646.25 --> 2651.92
really got to do and then they start to

2649.279 --> 2653.809
shake like puppets it's like a mini

2651.92 --> 2655.579
social justice where your trigger but in

2653.809 --> 2659.17
this is in another region and more

2655.579 --> 2659.17
people have it they just go

2666.26 --> 2674.6400000000003
yeah kind of sounded like Dell Dell the

2670.74 --> 2677.04
dolphin but yeah that's what they do and

2674.64 --> 2679.17
even yeah normally when I don't do this

2677.04 --> 2682.56
kind of thing when I don't Ram things

2679.17 --> 2687.51
straight in front of your face then

2682.56 --> 2690.15
they'll just go normal and normal talk

2687.51 --> 2694.4700000000003
about some things in your self-important

2690.15 --> 2697.23
opinions despite not actually getting

2694.47 --> 2701.9399999999996
over massive delusions in plain sight

2697.23 --> 2704.52
that a lot of people see now you're

2701.94 --> 2708.119
going with that but still yeah you have

2704.52 --> 2714.869
some self imagined weight with the other

2708.119 --> 2716.9700000000003
subjects you don't really really know

2714.869 --> 2719.2400000000002
where you get these opinions from anyway

2716.97 --> 2721.95
you're just grabbing it out of thin air

2719.24 --> 2723.4799999999996
hoping you won't accidentally see too

2721.95 --> 2726.06
far that's really what it practically

2723.48 --> 2727.68
comes down to a concerning information

2726.06 --> 2731.2799999999997
gathering as a bottom baller

2727.68 --> 2734.79
so just deepen the technicals don't look

2731.28 --> 2737.57
too far keep on building those

2734.79 --> 2737.57
machinations

2748.14 --> 2756.6299999999997
ranty yeah that was a fun show yesterday

stoic then than her him whatever but she

2818.089 --> 2826.14
sees parameter good bye bye anymore

2823.68 --> 2828.2
ballers that I've tolerated in the last

2826.14 --> 2838.73
few months that want to get banned

2828.2 --> 2841.97
because ready to do some cleaning so

2838.73 --> 2845.39
coming up say something that is totally

2841.97 --> 2848.45
just wrong out of place

2845.39 --> 2851.4
exaggerated overly politicized

2848.45 --> 2855.95
unreasonably negative towards me come on

2851.4 --> 2855.9500000000003
ballers put it in there you can do it

2859.97 --> 2868.0299999999997
come on yeah maybe it's a good time to

2864.89 --> 2868.0299999999997
share a little video

2873.369 --> 2876.509
let's see

2885.22 --> 2911.1099999999997
[Music]

2913.95 --> 2959.1
[Music]

2961.93 --> 2983.089
[Music]

2983.93 --> 2990.6499999999996
yeah it's a little loop but it's great

2996.94 --> 3003.559
Thank You anchor bear for that don't

3000.21 --> 3003.559
forget to subscribe to him

3019.99 --> 3029.41
it ain't no Musa rabbit true it's just a

3025.0 --> 3032.23
very Mimi loop and seriously I think

3029.41 --> 3034.72
that in not too in the not-too-distant

3032.23 --> 3036.73
future it could be like even seriously

3034.72 --> 3039.58
expanded upon there must be more of

3036.73 --> 3043.38
these types of idiots that were caught

3039.58 --> 3043.38
doing this kind of thing on camera

3072.27 --> 3078.84
yeah I wonder by the way how talked a

3076.53 --> 3080.3700000000003
little bit thinking I have been thinking

3078.84 --> 3083.82
about D live more and more I really

3080.37 --> 3086.43
wonder like what their overall policy is

3083.82 --> 3090.6000000000004
using music like if they really go

3086.43 --> 3093.6299999999997
striking people for using music or if

3090.6 --> 3096.81
they they have some other way of dealing

3093.63 --> 3100.17
with it or just ignore it because yeah

3096.81 --> 3103.47
I've been avoiding playing music for a

3100.17 --> 3105.39
long time because every time I do I have

3103.47 --> 3110.5499999999997
to take it out again and it's just a

3105.39 --> 3111.72
whole in show but or maybe on D life I

3110.55 --> 3116.3700000000003
could be a little bit more liberal

3111.72 --> 3121.1699999999996
concerning my music use because I love a

3116.37 --> 3125.6099999999997
lot of music all kinds of music like I

3121.17 --> 3127.4300000000003
have a lot of favorite songs and I just

3125.61 --> 3130.5
want to play around with them sometimes

3127.43 --> 3133.3399999999997
but I can't really do that on YouTube

3130.5 --> 3133.34
I get the feeling

3173.41 --> 3182.23
auntie moon-landing song what's this

3176.839 --> 3182.23
hey ISA morning

3184.36 --> 3188.52
what is that take a look

3201.47 --> 3204.6299999999997
[Music]

3213.52 --> 3228.13
all right okay some officials I'll take

3221.5 --> 3230.05
a look at it some later point it's yeah

3228.13 --> 3231.52
I've been pretty damn sure if I'm gonna

3230.05 --> 3234.55
play this on the show then I'll

3231.52 --> 3237.85
definitely it'll definitely get taken

3234.55 --> 3240.63
down for that so since this is just

3237.85 --> 3240.63
fresh out

3258.76 --> 3261.76
Wow

3289.78 --> 3296.7400000000002
more colored michael roark put out the

3293.71 --> 3299.85
link in chat I don't see why you need to

3296.74 --> 3299.85
put it out again

3339.44 --> 3353.109
yeah yeah you saw yeah you definitely

3350.299 --> 3353.109
deserve that

3357.73 --> 3370.839
so do you a Robin Stanley yeah and I

3366.89 --> 3370.839
think rikiya life kind of does as well

3384.019 --> 3388.8289999999997
yeah I'm gonna round out the show pretty

3386.219 --> 3393.119
quick now but I was just thinking like I

3388.829 --> 3397.9100000000003
really wonder how long this this

3393.119 --> 3397.9100000000003
partnership with you two will persist if

3400.4 --> 3406.65
in a way I am kind of curious to try out

3403.469 --> 3410.279
the life to kind of see if the numbers

3406.65 --> 3413.7290000000003
of typical followers of me are indeed

3410.279 --> 3417.63
suppressed or not they should be a

3413.729 --> 3419.999
little at least but I wonder if when I

3417.63 --> 3422.969
actually do it if it's actually not that

3419.999 --> 3427.109
bad compared to some others and

3422.969 --> 3430.739
imagining like I'm this big big person

3427.109 --> 3433.38
out there you know I'm just primarily a

3430.739 --> 3435.93
guy talking here and sharing his ideas

3433.38 --> 3444.059
trying to do his best and sharing his

3435.93 --> 3448.3489999999997
pain but yeah anyway I am gonna run out
