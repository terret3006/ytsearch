90.0 --> 94.4
yeah

91.36 --> 94.4
very much use it

96.56 --> 101.07900000000001
man prices have been going up

101.2 --> 107.759
like even in the supermarket where i go

105.119 --> 110.0
it's kind of brutal

107.759 --> 112.159
like this is gonna be problematic in the

110.0 --> 113.04
in the near future i don't know how

112.159 --> 117.52000000000001
that's

113.04 --> 117.52000000000001
is gonna balance out in the end but

119.2 --> 124.24000000000001
much choice now do i

121.28 --> 126.64
just keep going

124.24 --> 130.319
tightening the belt i guess

126.64 --> 130.319
anyhow the weather today is

131.44 --> 136.879
hot

133.599 --> 139.2
it started out super clear

136.879 --> 142.599
but now it's kind of like covered in

139.2 --> 142.599
sheep clouds

143.28 --> 146.16
cheap clouds

146.959 --> 150.8
accompanied by a couple of bigger ones

153.76 --> 157.56
very wind still

158.4 --> 160.56
so

161.04 --> 168.04
all right but despite that it's still

162.959 --> 168.04
pretty damn warm let me check it

172.56 --> 177.2
hello elise g first in chat good to see

175.04 --> 177.2
you

178.64 --> 184.76
it is thursday the 14th of july 2022

188.82 --> 195.04
[Music]

191.76 --> 195.04
it's 24 degrees

197.04 --> 199.84
could be worse

205.12 --> 210.31900000000002
wow

207.2 --> 212.48
what uh it says that the coming tuesday

210.319 --> 215.35999999999999
will be 35

212.48 --> 216.79899999999998
degrees what the

215.36 --> 218.799
wow

216.799 --> 220.56
that's

218.799 --> 221.92000000000002
that's quite extreme for the netherlands

220.56 --> 226.04
i wonder if that's actually going to

221.92 --> 226.04
come true but we'll see

227.68 --> 233.0
right

230.0 --> 233.0
anyway

243.599 --> 249.35999999999999
right so it's pretty

245.84 --> 252.72
up pretty early today

249.36 --> 252.72000000000003
to visit the

253.28 --> 258.88
uh the county

256.4 --> 261.44
the government

258.88 --> 264.32
for like a social

261.44 --> 266.479
welfare checkup apparently a routine

264.32 --> 269.199
thing that they do now i mean the the

266.479 --> 270.96
routines are constantly changed

269.199 --> 272.56
but yeah this is what they do you have

270.96 --> 274.0
to do that every year it's just a

272.56 --> 275.6
checkup and

274.0 --> 278.8
the guys that

275.6 --> 280.56
checked me up were pretty nice

278.8 --> 281.52000000000004
like very

280.56 --> 283.84
very

281.52 --> 287.03999999999996
soft and careful

283.84 --> 289.19899999999996
and yeah not that i that i was like in a

287.04 --> 290.32
bad mood or anything usually pretty

289.199 --> 292.479
nervous

290.32 --> 294.15999999999997
but yeah they were just trying to figure

292.479 --> 295.35999999999996
out like hey what are you doing is it

294.16 --> 297.91900000000004
successful

295.36 --> 299.199
maybe you need a job on the site

297.919 --> 301.039
or something

299.199 --> 303.12
just they didn't know anything about me

301.039 --> 305.68
pretty much so i actually

303.12 --> 310.4
laid it down like what am i doing here

305.68 --> 312.479
compared to previous job experiences and

310.4 --> 316.08
how i'm building up and learning a skill

312.479 --> 317.28
and now i still have the belief

316.08 --> 319.28
that

317.28 --> 321.039
i can break out

319.28 --> 323.75899999999996
somehow

321.039 --> 326.88
but that is mostly google

323.759 --> 329.84000000000003
i suspect like keeping down my numbers

326.88 --> 332.639
and that is preventing well effectively

329.84 --> 336.32
the ad money from increasing

332.639 --> 338.32
to actual viable levels

336.32 --> 341.44
i explained this to them and yeah they

338.32 --> 341.44
were agreeing

341.52 --> 345.75899999999996
also yeah they

343.6 --> 347.84000000000003
heard me out a little like well what is

345.759 --> 350.84000000000003
it that you talk about and you know what

347.84 --> 354.15999999999997
happens when somebody asked me that

350.84 --> 357.84
right because it's always like

354.16 --> 360.24
you have no idea what you just asked

357.84 --> 363.67999999999995
i talk about a lot

360.24 --> 366.479
a lot of very unusual things

363.68 --> 368.639
for the regular person

366.479 --> 370.8
and i'm kind of foul-mouthed and i even

368.639 --> 372.16
shared with them like oh yeah one guy

370.8 --> 374.479
was gonna check it out and i told him

372.16 --> 376.16
like okay just be careful i can't be a

374.479 --> 379.36
bit homophobic

376.16 --> 380.40000000000003
but it has a good reason

379.36 --> 382.88
because of

380.4 --> 385.28
it's like real it's not me trying to be

382.88 --> 388.96
tough guys like

385.28 --> 391.11999999999995
i actually have homophobia

388.96 --> 392.96
right so that turned out to be a good

391.12 --> 395.039
conversation i wonder if he's listening

392.96 --> 397.919
in probably not

395.039 --> 397.919
but we'll see

398.4 --> 403.12
it's raining here in new hampshire

400.639 --> 403.12
all right

404.56 --> 408.88
all right

406.4 --> 409.9
bitter rain is not bad in the summer

408.88 --> 412.99
right

409.9 --> 412.98999999999995
[Music]

413.36 --> 417.44
so that was what i was doing this

415.039 --> 417.44
morning

418.88 --> 425.199
uh yesterday

421.84 --> 425.19899999999996
a pretty intense day

425.36 --> 431.039
i had some tensions too even though my

428.08 --> 432.56
own live show yesterday was pretty good

431.039 --> 434.24
i thought

432.56 --> 437.12
oh by the way

434.24 --> 440.24
google apparently took note as well

437.12 --> 443.28000000000003
because it put my uploads to

440.24 --> 443.28000000000003
one again

443.68 --> 448.24
it's that it was apparently that time of

446.4 --> 450.4
the month or something for google

448.24 --> 453.36
because also

450.4 --> 455.67999999999995
letter of debates had like a thousand

453.36 --> 458.88
upvotes

455.68 --> 458.88
even during the live show

459.36 --> 463.28000000000003
so yeah

460.56 --> 466.24
flat earth early bird number 1202

463.28 --> 469.19899999999996
light has no speed einstein

466.24 --> 471.68
was the gandhi of math

469.199 --> 474.319
apparently that now has only one vote oh

471.68 --> 476.639
no they got my

474.319 --> 478.96000000000004
again not that it technically matters

476.639 --> 481.44
but it is kind of like okay

478.96 --> 484.31899999999996
all right then

481.44 --> 485.599
sure that with 218 views there's only

484.319 --> 489.28000000000003
one upload

485.599 --> 492.28
that should be real right

489.28 --> 492.28
now

492.4 --> 496.15999999999997
hey amanda young

494.479 --> 499.28
good to see you

496.16 --> 499.28000000000003
there 306

504.08 --> 509.28
yeah i know jared it's ridiculous

512.08 --> 514.8000000000001
whatever man

517.36 --> 521.08
it was a good show

526.32 --> 531.519
right but

528.16 --> 534.399
i'm certainly making a case

531.519 --> 536.48
when i said like yeah google is

534.399 --> 539.519
like holding me back

536.48 --> 541.76
i'm putting in everything i got

539.519 --> 545.519
and they are effectively making it

541.76 --> 545.519
impossible for me for me to

546.16 --> 553.1999999999999
become professional in this

549.2 --> 553.2
even though i am making that effort

554.8 --> 559.12
so yeah now the government knows

557.76 --> 561.76
indirectly

559.12 --> 563.6
who knows what's going to happen

561.76 --> 566.3199999999999
because the netherlands the government

563.6 --> 568.48
doesn't always agree with google

566.32 --> 572.44
so

568.48 --> 572.44
who knows what's gonna happen

576.519 --> 580.08
974 like okay

580.16 --> 584.48
right but

581.6 --> 587.6800000000001
look i'm not like how dare they do that

584.48 --> 589.279
to nathan and not me oh no no it doesn't

587.68 --> 591.519
matter it's

589.279 --> 594.0
it's just manipulation and it makes no

591.519 --> 595.839
sense and even nathan has shared on the

594.0 --> 598.32
show that he doesn't like it when that

595.839 --> 600.8800000000001
happens because it sends his stats into

598.32 --> 600.88
disarray

601.68 --> 607.68
so it's actually bad for him

604.88 --> 607.68
that that happens

610.079 --> 614.0
it happened to my show once

615.2 --> 618.5600000000001
i don't know

617.04 --> 621.12
has it actually

618.56 --> 623.1999999999999
or did i don't think so

621.12 --> 624.9590000000001
i mean i did have like a show with

623.2 --> 628.32
nathan one time

624.959 --> 630.88
in the flat earth talks days

628.32 --> 634.32
vladimir the the mother of all truth

630.88 --> 638.24
bombs right that had a had a huge view

634.32 --> 638.24
count and upvote count but

639.12 --> 646.839
that was because it was just a really

641.76 --> 646.8389999999999
good show and it was the right timing

654.399 --> 660.0
anyway look

656.079 --> 662.959
nathan's show is much more focused

660.0 --> 666.16
he technically does put a lot more work

662.959 --> 669.04
into it than i do

666.16 --> 671.68
with my shows

669.04 --> 673.76
technically because he just is working

671.68 --> 674.7199999999999
on the computer

673.76 --> 677.4399999999999
doing

674.72 --> 679.36
yeah a lot of things with that editing

677.44 --> 682.0
and all that i don't

679.36 --> 684.88
really do that

682.0 --> 686.959
and he does it all the time

684.88 --> 689.6
so he deserves

686.959 --> 692.56
to actually get more

689.6 --> 695.36
attention like that he just does and hey

692.56 --> 697.1999999999999
the panel's great is what that i'm part

695.36 --> 698.88
of the panel very happy to be part of

697.2 --> 700.399
his panel

698.88 --> 704.399
no sometimes

700.399 --> 704.399
he can really pissed me off

705.45 --> 708.8000000000001
[Music]

706.8 --> 711.3599999999999
and yeah yesterday's show that did also

708.8 --> 713.8389999999999
happen by the way in the after show i i

711.36 --> 715.6
kind of exploded because i was just

713.839 --> 717.839
pissed off that

715.6 --> 718.72
i felt like i was being treated like a

717.839 --> 720.5600000000001
second

718.72 --> 722.24
class

720.56 --> 724.079
panelist

722.24 --> 726.16
and it was a bit of an exaggerated

724.079 --> 726.8
reaction

726.16 --> 730.079
i

726.8 --> 732.56
yeah but then 10th man jumped all over

730.079 --> 735.12
it again i just shut up after that point

732.56 --> 737.1199999999999
because all i i just wanted to express

735.12 --> 739.12
how i felt about it

737.12 --> 741.68
and everybody started complaining and i

739.12 --> 744.079
just shut up until it shut up and i

741.68 --> 745.8389999999999
asked nathan also through skype could

744.079 --> 747.68
you please just cut that part out

745.839 --> 750.0790000000001
because

747.68 --> 753.8389999999999
it's a really good show

750.079 --> 753.8389999999999
after that point it is

754.399 --> 760.959
i mean it was a very long show very long

757.68 --> 764.5999999999999
after show and it was really focused

760.959 --> 764.5999999999999
was a lot of energy

777.44 --> 783.2
content is mostly essential right well i

780.079 --> 786.0
do have content as well it's just that

783.2 --> 789.2
my content compared to nathan's content

786.0 --> 789.2
is less organized

789.44 --> 793.6
effectively

790.959 --> 794.6389999999999
i mean i have titles

793.6 --> 797.839
but

794.639 --> 799.44
i don't have like separate clips

797.839 --> 802.8800000000001
or anything

799.44 --> 802.8800000000001
i don't do that it's

808.959 --> 815.3599999999999
i just never i was always like i'm gonna

811.839 --> 818.9590000000001
do everything live because also i want

815.36 --> 821.92
to learn to be able to

818.959 --> 821.92
improvise it

822.399 --> 827.6
i don't want to rely on certain moments

824.56 --> 829.8389999999999
where i think i said something good

827.6 --> 833.1990000000001
and then edit that and use that all the

829.839 --> 835.12
time i just want to be able to say it

833.199 --> 837.3599999999999
fresh from the tongue

835.12 --> 840.72
just like that

837.36 --> 841.6
it's part of my skill learning curve

840.72 --> 844.1600000000001
how

841.6 --> 846.9590000000001
how i do things

844.16 --> 851.68
with my channel

846.959 --> 851.68
but yeah it does have downsides though

851.91 --> 854.98
[Music]

855.44 --> 859.12
because

857.519 --> 861.199
yeah

859.12 --> 864.76
not everybody has that level of

861.199 --> 864.76
attention span

877.279 --> 879.76
anyhow

882.959 --> 885.8389999999999
uh

888.959 --> 892.279
let's see

905.04 --> 908.8
what was i watching yesterday

910.56 --> 914.16
i didn't go to bed very late because i

912.399 --> 915.76
had to get up early

914.16 --> 919.48
and that worked out

915.76 --> 919.48
i had a good sleep

937.92 --> 942.639
yeah that wasn't there wasn't much going

939.839 --> 942.639
on yesterday

944.959 --> 952.3789999999999
hey mike seduc good to see you

949.2 --> 952.379
[Music]

962.32 --> 968.6
right so yeah yesterday hello white

965.6 --> 968.6
pigeon

did post a picture of himself in george

1234.4 --> 1236.72
okay

1246.72 --> 1251.039
i don't think that's the reason why he

1248.48 --> 1252.96
got suspended though

1251.039 --> 1255.76
maybe he's just

1252.96 --> 1260.039
it's like a you can't live stream type

1255.76 --> 1260.039
of thing you can still upload

1268.0 --> 1272.08
oh okay pgc net see you later

1307.12 --> 1309.84
right so

1311.12 --> 1316.08
yeah i'm i'm kind of shy for a subject

1313.36 --> 1316.08
to talk about

1317.28 --> 1320.72
i could just

1318.559 --> 1323.76
recycle stuff that i had been talking

1320.72 --> 1323.76
about again but

1325.12 --> 1330.0
i know i feel there's something out

1327.679 --> 1330.0
there

1330.799 --> 1336.12
that could be interesting i just have to

1332.799 --> 1336.12
find it

1350.08 --> 1352.0
huh

1350.88 --> 1355.6000000000001
okay

1352.0 --> 1358.32
according to news flashes apparently

1355.6 --> 1363.039
france's government has

1358.32 --> 1363.039
banned vaccine passports yay

1363.36 --> 1367.84
yes it is

1364.799 --> 1367.84
good enough i guess

1368.08 --> 1372.24
it's just ridiculous that

1370.32 --> 1374.72
it's being tried

1372.24 --> 1375.76
in the first place

1374.72 --> 1378.48

1375.76 --> 1378.48
that's the thing

roasting him for wearing jerks yeah of

that's what owen does though

1399.039 --> 1405.84
right but at least

1401.44 --> 1407.76
jim bob doesn't iron his shorts

1405.84 --> 1409.52
his jaws i mean

1407.76 --> 1412.48
because then that's

1409.52 --> 1415.28
that's bad news

1412.48 --> 1417.28
like those guys that were complaining

1415.28 --> 1420.48
with the government

1417.28 --> 1422.8799999999999
uh over uh

1420.48 --> 1425.279
over at where own benjamin is

1422.88 --> 1427.1200000000001

wearing iron

1444.96 --> 1450.72
george sanford

1447.76 --> 1452.1589999999999
it's not about them getting the

it's about you

to their

1457.2 --> 1462.559
medical authority

1460.08 --> 1465.12
to become part of their system that is

1462.559 --> 1466.559
what it's about it's not about attaining

1465.12 --> 1468.799
information

1466.559 --> 1471.44
from the person

1468.799 --> 1473.84
don't you understand george sanford has

1471.44 --> 1476.96
nothing to do with oh they need that

1473.84 --> 1479.84
information no no they don't

1476.96 --> 1482.72
they need you to comply

1479.84 --> 1486.1589999999999
to their new medical authority that they

1482.72 --> 1488.88
are trying to invoke conjure up that's

1486.159 --> 1488.88
what it's about

[Music]

1491.279 --> 1497.36
took a jab they are in or

1494.48 --> 1497.3600000000001
arguably

1497.679 --> 1501.919
but that's not what the vaccine passport

1500.0 --> 1503.679
is about it's about

1501.919 --> 1506.0800000000002
making you submit to their medical

1503.679 --> 1507.3600000000001
authority

1506.08 --> 1509.76
right

1507.36 --> 1510.7199999999998
when you do that the rules change for

1509.76 --> 1512.559
you

1510.72 --> 1515.84
not in a good way

1512.559 --> 1515.84
that's how it works

1518.88 --> 1522.7990000000002
when will the government again relaunch

1520.799 --> 1524.48
the pandemic drama when it is most

1522.799 --> 1528.36
convenient for them

1524.48 --> 1528.3600000000001
to unroll that distraction

1537.279 --> 1544.0
the whole covet [ __ ]

1540.159 --> 1545.3600000000001
what it effectively is is a new form of

1544.0 --> 1547.52
priesthood

1545.36 --> 1550.24
this priesthood

1547.52 --> 1551.12
is basing its power

1550.24 --> 1552.159
on

1551.12 --> 1554.84
the

1552.159 --> 1556.72
yeah the fictional

1554.84 --> 1559.1999999999998
medical

1556.72 --> 1561.679
theories

1559.2 --> 1563.2
that aren't actually scientifically

1561.679 --> 1566.0
proven even

1563.2 --> 1568.4
entirely it's entirely debunked

1566.0 --> 1570.24
they have no proof but they claim to

1568.4 --> 1572.5590000000002
have it

1570.24 --> 1572.559
and

1573.039 --> 1576.72
yeah they just

1574.64 --> 1579.6000000000001
want that power

1576.72 --> 1582.88
over the people but for them to get it

1579.6 --> 1585.6
the people must submit to them

1582.88 --> 1588.159
submit to their authority take the mark

1585.6 --> 1588.1589999999999
if you will

1589.039 --> 1592.96
and that has legal implications

1597.52 --> 1602.1589999999999
so that's what the vaccine passport is

1599.76 --> 1602.1589999999999

1652.08 --> 1658.61

from the windows and blah blah

make sure there's no

1669.039 --> 1675.679
live g-tower the g5 towers around

1675.679 --> 1679.039
just fine

out from

it's all fiction

it's very convenient though to scare you

1696.24 --> 1701.76
back into that house

1698.399 --> 1703.039
be afraid be afraid of the outside it's

1701.76 --> 1706.1589999999999
very

1703.039 --> 1708.1589999999999
resonating with the general scenario of

1706.159 --> 1710.48
lockdowns isn't it

1708.159 --> 1711.2
it's like oh well if you don't believe

1710.48 --> 1713.84
in

1711.2 --> 1715.679
been scary viruses

1713.84 --> 1717.76
coming for you

1715.679 --> 1719.3600000000001
doing nothing but still have to be

1717.76 --> 1720.799
scared

1719.36 --> 1722.9599999999998
if you're not going to lock yourself

1720.799 --> 1726.24
inside your home for that anymore well

1722.96 --> 1729.44
then maybe is somewhere in the future

1726.24 --> 1731.2
there might be a nuke threat

1729.44 --> 1733.76
and then you have to get inside of your

1731.2 --> 1736.0
house for that right and you already had

1733.76 --> 1737.84
halfway training to that

1736.0 --> 1738.559
to that conditioning and so they can

1737.84 --> 1741.039
just

1738.559 --> 1744.559
switch the story

1741.039 --> 1744.559
isn't that just convenient

1746.48 --> 1750.84
all right

1747.6 --> 1754.1589999999999
just want you to get inside be

1750.84 --> 1754.1589999999999
afraid and

1755.12 --> 1758.0
just

1756.72 --> 1760.32
let

1758.0 --> 1762.08
government and the corporations do

1760.32 --> 1764.96
whatever they want

1762.08 --> 1764.96
that's what they want

1765.52 --> 1770.12
weapons of mass distraction indeed

1778.14 --> 1781.3190000000002
[Music]

1792.399 --> 1797.6
right so

1794.559 --> 1797.6
it could be that

1798.08 --> 1802.0
the

1799.12 --> 1803.9189999999999
covet spell and including the monkey

1802.0 --> 1806.08
pucks and all that

1803.919 --> 1807.44
that the the power

1806.08 --> 1810.08
the momentum

1807.44 --> 1812.3200000000002
of the medical spell

1810.08 --> 1814.32
the medical indoctrination spells are

1812.32 --> 1816.08
faltering

1814.32 --> 1818.799
right they have been for a while but

1816.08 --> 1820.6399999999999
that they are faltering to a a critical

1818.799 --> 1823.2
mass level where they just

1820.64 --> 1826.72
can't

1823.2 --> 1826.72
really do it anymore

1826.799 --> 1831.9189999999999
that the repercussions would be make it

1828.72 --> 1833.84
not worth it trying it

1831.919 --> 1837.1200000000001
and so then they're probably going to

1833.84 --> 1839.52
move on to another fictional medium to

1837.12 --> 1841.36
attempt the same thing with

1839.52 --> 1844.0
and that could be

1841.36 --> 1846.1589999999999
very much like the cold war scare

1844.0 --> 1848.159
nuclear threat

1846.159 --> 1849.279
right talk about it all the time show

1848.159 --> 1852.0800000000002
the bombs

1849.279 --> 1853.039
look at all that oh

1852.08 --> 1855.039
and then

1853.039 --> 1857.6
instead of

1855.039 --> 1859.44
being commanded to look be locked inside

1857.6 --> 1861.76
of your home because the medical

1859.44 --> 1863.6000000000001
establishment have foreseen and the

1861.76 --> 1865.76
virus on the loose

1863.6 --> 1869.279
now you're gonna be like oh oh no

1865.76 --> 1873.44
there's no potential nuke threat

1869.279 --> 1873.44
get in you have to stay inside today

1874.559 --> 1881.76
because there might have just been

1878.64 --> 1883.8400000000001
some potential nuclear threat or

1881.76 --> 1886.0
you you don't know where it's gonna go

1883.84 --> 1888.08
they could make up all kinds of crazy

1886.0 --> 1890.88
things

1888.08 --> 1893.84
even besides just a noob

1890.88 --> 1893.8400000000001
so

1895.519 --> 1901.2
it all comes down they just want you

1897.279 --> 1907.08
inside your house and shut the hell up

1901.2 --> 1907.0800000000002
and if all possible just starve to death

1922.72 --> 1926.96
all right and i i hope that

1925.519 --> 1928.64
even those

1926.96 --> 1930.159
attempts to

1928.64 --> 1933.2
bridge

1930.159 --> 1935.279
to change the story base

1933.2 --> 1937.2
for the actions

1935.279 --> 1939.679
that even the changing of that is not

1937.2 --> 1942.64
going to work i really hope so i hope it

1939.679 --> 1945.2
i hope their power is just going to be

1942.64 --> 1945.2
done now

1947.76 --> 1952.1589999999999
mind control wise

1949.679 --> 1952.159
we'll see

1953.44 --> 1957.919
realize that even all the people that

1955.44 --> 1959.679
are in that system that are doing the

1957.919 --> 1961.76
work that are doing the announcements

1959.679 --> 1963.2
that are planning

1961.76 --> 1965.84
the things

1963.2 --> 1969.519
concerning the medical threats

1965.84 --> 1972.08
that they too have opportunity

1969.519 --> 1975.6
to learn about what it is

1972.08 --> 1977.76
that they're actually teaching

1975.6 --> 1980.9599999999998
they have this opportunity over time

1977.76 --> 1983.76
they have opportunities to bump into

1980.96 --> 1983.76
alternative

1984.799 --> 1989.6
medical people

1987.6 --> 1992.32
and get to learn like this is all

1989.6 --> 1995.6
nonsense it's like viruses don't even

1992.32 --> 1997.84
exist it's a conceptual

1995.6 --> 1997.84
thing

1998.08 --> 2002.24
for which there is no scientific

1999.76 --> 2002.24
evidence

2003.12 --> 2009.6
they just call things viruses

2006.96 --> 2012.72
they aren't actually viruses

2009.6 --> 2016.24
there is no such thing as a virus

2012.72 --> 2018.559
it's all fiction it's all conceptual

2016.24 --> 2021.279
started out very early

2018.559 --> 2024.24
during the age of futurism

2021.279 --> 2027.039
in like the early 20th century

2024.24 --> 2029.36
and echoed on in the science fiction

2027.039 --> 2030.72
and then

2029.36 --> 2033.76
they just

2030.72 --> 2036.08
normalized it

2033.76 --> 2038.559
like throughout the

2036.08 --> 2040.559
the atomic age it's just normal it's

2038.559 --> 2042.8799999999999
like oh yeah they're real now you're

2040.559 --> 2046.559
we're just gonna act like they're real

2042.88 --> 2049.599
now and and everybody went with it

2046.559 --> 2052.48
for almost a century now

2049.599 --> 2055.44
people just went with it even though

2052.48 --> 2059.119
there is absolutely no viable scientific

2055.44 --> 2061.359
evidence that viruses even exist

2059.119 --> 2065.9190000000003
in accordance to their model like there

2061.359 --> 2065.919
is no such thing no such effect

2068.0 --> 2070.96
right there's medical conditions for

2069.919 --> 2072.7999999999997
sure

2070.96 --> 2075.04
and there's all kinds of weird things

2072.8 --> 2077.28
that happen in your body during medical

2075.04 --> 2079.44
conditions like

2077.28 --> 2081.679
clean up processes

2079.44 --> 2084.56
emergency

2081.679 --> 2085.919
redistribution

2084.56 --> 2088.32
of like

2085.919 --> 2091.3199999999997
substances that you need for

2088.32 --> 2091.32
regeneration

2092.56 --> 2099.7599999999998
different cycles there's look medical

2096.8 --> 2103.8
what the medical reality of our bodies

2099.76 --> 2103.8
is very complicated

2103.839 --> 2107.68
and

2104.8 --> 2110.32
the medical establishment likes to make

2107.68 --> 2112.48
everybody believe like they have it all

2110.32 --> 2114.0
figured out where did we hear that

2112.48 --> 2116.64
before right

2114.0 --> 2118.24
huh globe earth oh we know it all we've

2116.64 --> 2120.72
seen it all oh yes it's all been

2118.24 --> 2122.64
explored no no

2120.72 --> 2124.7999999999997
no and neither

2122.64 --> 2127.7599999999998
with the functioning of biology on a

2124.8 --> 2130.8
micro level it is

2127.76 --> 2133.76
almost intanable like alternative

2130.8 --> 2135.599
medical researchers that have dug really

2133.76 --> 2136.48
deep into it and made it their life's

2135.599 --> 2139.2000000000003
work

2136.48 --> 2140.8
it shines on through them like

2139.2 --> 2144.64
this is so much

2140.8 --> 2147.3590000000004
it can never be mastered

2144.64 --> 2150.24
but we can figure things out that's just

2147.359 --> 2153.68
the reality it's the reality it's too

2150.24 --> 2155.1189999999997
complex you can't put it in an easy

2153.68 --> 2156.7999999999997
model

2155.119 --> 2159.44
like this

2156.8 --> 2163.8390000000004
like the virus theory and all that

2159.44 --> 2163.839
and the immune system in that sense

2165.04 --> 2169.2
right

2166.56 --> 2171.2
the best most viable approach in general

2169.2 --> 2172.96
in order to figure out whether there are

2171.2 --> 2176.24
conditions you have and the cause of

2172.96 --> 2178.4
them would be the terrain theory

2176.24 --> 2179.839
the alternative medical model to the

2178.4 --> 2182.2400000000002
virus

2179.839 --> 2182.24
theory

2182.96 --> 2187.599
and

2184.56 --> 2190.4
uh but even the germ theory

2187.599 --> 2191.6800000000003
is the yeah the terrain theory

2190.4 --> 2194.1600000000003
that one

2191.68 --> 2196.24
is the most useful

2194.16 --> 2197.68
because it's it really works it's all

2196.24 --> 2201.5989999999997
about the terrain it's all about the

2197.68 --> 2205.359
conditions all the conditions compound

2201.599 --> 2206.2400000000002
that compounding then brings your

2205.359 --> 2208.88
body

2206.24 --> 2211.9199999999996
effectively into different states of

2208.88 --> 2214.48
emergency where in every state

2211.92 --> 2216.2400000000002
things become slightly different

2214.48 --> 2218.079
your body works differently under

2216.24 --> 2220.7999999999997
certain levels of stress your body works

2218.079 --> 2225.119
differently when you take in

2220.8 --> 2225.119
pharmaceutical drugs for whatever reason

2225.28 --> 2228.28
and

2228.56 --> 2233.359
unhealthy substances in your food all of

2231.52 --> 2235.92
this compounds

2233.359 --> 2237.5989999999997
these create conditions

2235.92 --> 2240.079
that will

2237.599 --> 2241.04
give rise

2240.079 --> 2243.8390000000004
to

2241.04 --> 2243.839
well illness

2244.0 --> 2248.72
sickness

2246.0 --> 2250.64
and certain type of conditions

2248.72 --> 2252.3199999999997
like even aids

2250.64 --> 2254.24
is a condition

2252.32 --> 2257.3590000000004
now that's been claimed that it's caused

2254.24 --> 2259.839
by a virus hiv virus

2257.359 --> 2263.119
it's kind of

2259.839 --> 2264.88
but yeah the aids condition auto immune

2263.119 --> 2268.079
disorder

2264.88 --> 2268.839
is a real condition it's basically

2268.079 --> 2271.599
your

2268.839 --> 2273.7599999999998
body's micro

2271.599 --> 2276.0
systems have collapsed and you can't

2273.76 --> 2277.8390000000004
regenerate anymore that's pretty much

2276.0 --> 2280.16
what aids is

2277.839 --> 2284.04
but it's not caused by a virus it's

2280.16 --> 2284.04
caused by poisoning

2285.2 --> 2292.3199999999997
right these terrible aids victims

2289.359 --> 2294.3199999999997
from what was it the 80s

2292.32 --> 2295.44
from the gay scene

2294.32 --> 2298.48
yeah

2295.44 --> 2300.56
that wasn't

2298.48 --> 2301.52
because of a virus

2300.56 --> 2304.4
you see

2301.52 --> 2307.04
it was because of terrible living

2304.4 --> 2309.76
conditions

2307.04 --> 2312.88
using too much drugs having not enough

2309.76 --> 2316.1600000000003
sleep and you know what

2312.88 --> 2317.92
sodomy very unhealthy especially if you

2316.16 --> 2320.72
do it a lot

2317.92 --> 2322.56
gross also right

2320.72 --> 2324.64
that arises to

2322.56 --> 2326.72
a terrible condition

2324.64 --> 2329.68
and if you then get convinced by the

2326.72 --> 2332.24
doctor oh you have uh this or that you

2329.68 --> 2334.96
need to take this ramdas if you

2332.24 --> 2336.72
ah what was it a azt

2334.96 --> 2339.52
sorry not ram that it's almost it's

2336.72 --> 2341.7599999999998
terrible but act take this

2339.52 --> 2343.52
this is the anti-age drug guess what you

2341.76 --> 2344.5600000000004
get from that

2343.52 --> 2346.48
total

2344.56 --> 2349.359
system collapse

2346.48 --> 2353.2
and now you actually have aids

2349.359 --> 2356.64
because of that disgusting poison

2353.2 --> 2357.4399999999996
that was advised by doctors for people

2356.64 --> 2360.72
that

2357.44 --> 2360.7200000000003
thought they had hiv

2364.16 --> 2370.16
right but hey magic johnson

2367.44 --> 2373.04
i think he's still around

2370.16 --> 2377.2
he also allegedly had aids

2373.04 --> 2379.92
and he never took azt he rejected that

2377.2 --> 2382.3199999999997
and he's still he's right there right

2379.92 --> 2385.359
now he's not even doing bad i think he's

2382.32 --> 2387.52
not like in a degenerating condition

2385.359 --> 2390.52
he's doing fine

2387.52 --> 2390.52
right

2401.599 --> 2404.8
so

2402.64 --> 2406.0789999999997
yeah that's what it is it's a mind

2404.8 --> 2408.8
control

2406.079 --> 2411.119
system a new priesthood

2408.8 --> 2413.76
based in medical authority

2411.119 --> 2417.839
but you have to give it to them

2413.76 --> 2420.4
in order for them to actually be able to

2417.839 --> 2422.96
screw around with you

2420.4 --> 2425.28
if you just don't give in

2422.96 --> 2428.48
then there is nothing they can do but

2425.28 --> 2428.48
just try to scare you

2430.8 --> 2436.8
or heighten the restriction levels for

2433.52 --> 2439.359
their own following for those that have

2436.8 --> 2441.52
given into their medical authority right

2439.359 --> 2443.68
oh you're gonna you've got to be vexed

2441.52 --> 2445.44
now to get in this place well that's

2443.68 --> 2447.2
because the owner of that place made

2445.44 --> 2449.839
that deal

2447.2 --> 2452.839
to do that probably for financial

2449.839 --> 2452.839
benefits

2453.04 --> 2456.8
that's like the worst they can do

2454.64 --> 2459.5989999999997
suddenly this place you apparently like

2456.8 --> 2462.0
to visit you can't go there now

2459.599 --> 2466.3590000000004
because the owner bought into the

2462.0 --> 2466.359
medical establishment authority

2466.48 --> 2471.359
right they can't do anything to you

2468.96 --> 2473.68
except scare you and try to cut you off

2471.359 --> 2478.68
public places

2473.68 --> 2478.68
which they effectively bribe to do that

2482.16 --> 2488.1299999999997
allegedly anyway

2484.95 --> 2488.1299999999997
[Music]

2493.76 --> 2496.88
right but there people are realizing

2495.92 --> 2499.44
this

2496.88 --> 2501.44
even as i'm explaining it what i'm

2499.44 --> 2503.28
explaining is not even that

2501.44 --> 2506.0
revolutionary

2503.28 --> 2508.48
i mean it is i'm very proud to be able

2506.0 --> 2510.88
to explain it like this it is still

2508.48 --> 2512.88
revolutionary but it's not new i mean

2510.88 --> 2514.0
there is

2512.88 --> 2516.1600000000003
there are

2514.0 --> 2519.119
thousands and thousands of people out

2516.16 --> 2521.839
there that do media that are making

2519.119 --> 2524.4
videos that are having live shows

2521.839 --> 2527.2799999999997
that really get this now

2524.4 --> 2530.1600000000003
universal like there's a priesthood

2527.28 --> 2534.2400000000002
they try to mind control everybody

2530.16 --> 2536.0
into giving them authority

2534.24 --> 2538.9599999999996
that's the trick that's the big

2536.0 --> 2538.96
magician's trick

2541.839 --> 2545.7
so just don't give it to them just live

2544.48 --> 2547.92
your own life

2545.7 --> 2550.64
[Music]

2547.92 --> 2552.56
realize god's laws

2550.64 --> 2555.839
the design what you're supposed to be

2552.56 --> 2559.68
doing with your life in general

2555.839 --> 2561.68
and then do your best to pursue that

2559.68 --> 2564.24
don't get distracted

2561.68 --> 2567.1189999999997
or caught up with these mind control

2564.24 --> 2569.839
programs they might even suggest that

2567.119 --> 2571.28
you'll get power if you buy into them

2569.839 --> 2573.04
right

2571.28 --> 2575.76
well you won't

2573.04 --> 2578.56
you only have petty power over those

2575.76 --> 2579.599
within

2578.56 --> 2581.44
the group

2579.599 --> 2583.44
that has basically given into their

2581.44 --> 2585.359
authority

2583.44 --> 2586.64
those aren't even people you really want

2585.359 --> 2588.96
to

2586.64 --> 2590.8799999999997
interact with in my opinion

2588.96 --> 2593.2
all slaves what you want power over

2590.88 --> 2594.7200000000003
slaves how about power over yourself how

2593.2 --> 2597.4399999999996
about power

2594.72 --> 2600.3999999999996
to actually be free and

2597.44 --> 2602.319
retain your critical thinking ability

2600.4 --> 2603.839
not have your critical thinking

2602.319 --> 2606.4
outsourced

2603.839 --> 2608.96
by mega corporation

2606.4 --> 2610.4
mind control programming right because

2608.96 --> 2613.2
it is what it is isn't it it's

2610.4 --> 2613.2000000000003
outsourcing

2615.359 --> 2621.5989999999997
you're not doing it yourself anymore you

2618.079 --> 2623.119
give that task over to something else

2621.599 --> 2625.52
the programming

2623.119 --> 2628.0
you just start copying them you think

2625.52 --> 2629.68
you're supposed to do that

2628.0 --> 2632.839
it's outsourcing

2629.68 --> 2635.839
outsourcing your critical

2632.839 --> 2638.16
thinking don't do that

2635.839 --> 2640.319
or at least try not to do that sometimes

2638.16 --> 2643.68
people just do it by habit and by

2640.319 --> 2646.88
accident they don't even realize it well

2643.68 --> 2648.64
get on to that realize it realize what

2646.88 --> 2651.04
you're doing realize

2648.64 --> 2653.2799999999997
how it isn't in your best interest to do

2651.04 --> 2653.2799999999997
that

2654.56 --> 2661.44
and stop it step away from it

2657.76 --> 2664.4
reveal your regret about it

2661.44 --> 2665.599
try to atone for it to the best of your

2664.4 --> 2668.7200000000003
abilities

2665.599 --> 2671.52
but at least step away

2668.72 --> 2674.0789999999997
more step away the less authority

2671.52 --> 2676.079
they have over the people

2674.079 --> 2678.2400000000002
basically the less people will give in

2676.079 --> 2680.1600000000003
to their authority and then

2678.24 --> 2681.7599999999998
all their dictates it doesn't mean

2680.16 --> 2683.44
anything because they don't have the

2681.76 --> 2685.0400000000004
numbers anymore they don't have the

2683.44 --> 2687.119
followers

2685.04 --> 2689.599
it's not going to work anymore then

2687.119 --> 2691.44
it'll just be blah blah blah blah blah

2689.599 --> 2693.44
from some tower

2691.44 --> 2696.319
somewhere

2693.44 --> 2696.319
and it doesn't matter

2701.04 --> 2706.4
hey godzilla

2702.4 --> 2708.7200000000003
and fine big pine sailing

2706.4 --> 2708.7200000000003
what

2716.48 --> 2719.839
what are you talking about

2722.0 --> 2726.64
27 courses or fee

2724.96 --> 2728.0
what

2726.64 --> 2731.0
really

2728.0 --> 2731.0
ugh

2743.599 --> 2748.06
right so

2744.96 --> 2751.23
glad to have laid that down

2748.06 --> 2751.23
[Music]

2755.2 --> 2761.5989999999997
and i think we're all doing good

2757.68 --> 2766.0
right just be careful right

2761.599 --> 2766.0
i mean it is in our nature to basically

2766.24 --> 2771.359
just for learning to follow people

2769.119 --> 2773.6800000000003
follow what they're saying follow their

2771.359 --> 2775.52
character build up their

2773.68 --> 2777.1189999999997
thinking

2775.52 --> 2778.88
and their ideas

2777.119 --> 2779.92
it's in their nature it's how we learn a

2778.88 --> 2781.6800000000003
lot

2779.92 --> 2785.44
but be careful

2781.68 --> 2787.2
not to basically seek out another priest

2785.44 --> 2788.7200000000003
to worship

2787.2 --> 2791.1189999999997
right

2788.72 --> 2793.9199999999996
there's a lot of people

2791.119 --> 2797.04
including among flat earth

2793.92 --> 2798.56
that have a tendency to kind of make a

2797.04 --> 2800.16
new

2798.56 --> 2802.64
story

2800.16 --> 2806.24
and then reify it

2802.64 --> 2809.68
reify parts about it without proving it

2806.24 --> 2812.0
but to always like keep the same story

2809.68 --> 2814.0789999999997
well that's effectively

2812.0 --> 2816.56
whether they realize it or not like

2814.079 --> 2818.96
conjuring a new form of priesthood and

2816.56 --> 2821.359
the people that follow that then fall

2818.96 --> 2823.92
into the same trap

2821.359 --> 2825.359
you might not be a male malevolent

2823.92 --> 2827.44
grabbler

2825.359 --> 2829.7599999999998
you or you could be

2827.44 --> 2832.48
trying to mind control people i think

2829.76 --> 2836.96
that like rv is one of those people like

2832.48 --> 2840.72
he does that he is trying to be a priest

2836.96 --> 2842.559
and he is not trustworthy

2840.72 --> 2843.359
at all

2842.559 --> 2846.079
right

2843.359 --> 2848.0789999999997
but he's not like an organization

2846.079 --> 2850.559
it's not like a satanic organization

2848.079 --> 2852.2400000000002
just trying to create a flock

2850.559 --> 2854.6400000000003
to like

2852.24 --> 2858.319
really crush down on

2854.64 --> 2860.0
on the long run but it is still like

2858.319 --> 2862.88
playing into that

2860.0 --> 2865.76
tendency for people to oh

2862.88 --> 2867.92
oh we lost we lost her outer space in

2865.76 --> 2870.48
the globe story but that was so great i

2867.92 --> 2872.7200000000003
gotta find a new storyteller what is

2870.48 --> 2875.04
this flat earther storyteller

2872.72 --> 2877.68
yes that's the new storyteller we've

2875.04 --> 2880.8
been looking for

2877.68 --> 2882.24
oh so you're not then actually gonna try

2880.8 --> 2884.8
to figure out

2882.24 --> 2887.68
what that was and why you got stuck in

2884.8 --> 2888.6400000000003
it and sharpen your critical thinking

2887.68 --> 2890.319
skills

2888.64 --> 2892.4
you're just gonna follow a new

2890.319 --> 2894.16
storyteller and just ah

2892.4 --> 2896.2400000000002
oh wow

2894.16 --> 2898.48
oh wow let's not question that but it's

2896.24 --> 2900.3999999999996
so great

2898.48 --> 2902.88
that's what a lot of people do

2900.4 --> 2904.96
and it's not good it's not good for you

2902.88 --> 2907.76
it's not good for the world because

2904.96 --> 2909.52
nothing happens

2907.76 --> 2912.0
when you do that

2909.52 --> 2913.28
nothing changes it's just

2912.0 --> 2915.04
one problem

2913.28 --> 2917.6800000000003
you thought you stepped out of the

2915.04 --> 2920.48
problem but then you created the problem

2917.68 --> 2922.5589999999997
in another format right

2920.48 --> 2924.2400000000002
right next to it

2922.559 --> 2926.96
and then you think you solved the first

2924.24 --> 2931.2799999999997
problem but you didn't you just

2926.96 --> 2931.28
took on another problem of the same sort

2933.76 --> 2938.1600000000003
right

2935.52 --> 2940.559
effectively the problem is not

2938.16 --> 2941.7599999999998
the information within the priesthood

2940.559 --> 2945.0400000000004
lies

2941.76 --> 2948.559
the problem is the lack of critical

2945.04 --> 2951.52
thinking skills in the people that is

2948.559 --> 2952.88
the main problem it always was it always

2951.52 --> 2953.92
will be

2952.88 --> 2955.599
right

2953.92 --> 2957.119
if you have critical thinking skills

2955.599 --> 2959.119
then it doesn't matter if the

2957.119 --> 2961.359
information of some organization does

2959.119 --> 2964.079
make any sense because you will be able

2961.359 --> 2966.319
to very quickly figure that out using

2964.079 --> 2968.079
your critical thinking

2966.319 --> 2971.2799999999997
if you don't have critical thinking then

2968.079 --> 2973.92
you can't tell

2971.28 --> 2976.0
whether an organization is really good

2973.92 --> 2977.839
or actually

2976.0 --> 2980.64
like a trap

2977.839 --> 2982.7999999999997
trying to feed off you

2980.64 --> 2985.1189999999997
you need that critical thinking

2982.8 --> 2986.96
right so never forget it's not about the

2985.119 --> 2989.359
information it's about your critical

2986.96 --> 2991.92
thinking concerning the information that

2989.359 --> 2993.68
is the more important part every time

2991.92 --> 2997.0
every time

2993.68 --> 2997.0
don't forget

3000.64 --> 3004.72
rb gerund no i don't think jaren is a

3003.04 --> 3007.04
cult of personality

3004.72 --> 3008.72
i mean he has a he is a

3007.04 --> 3010.319
an interesting person

3008.72 --> 3015.4399999999996
in his own way

3010.319 --> 3015.44
rv yeah jaren no i don't think so

3021.68 --> 3025.2
jaren has

3022.96 --> 3026.64
critical thinking skills

3025.2 --> 3029.4399999999996
well developed

3026.64 --> 3029.44
very careful

3030.48 --> 3034.4
and he does share that

3033.28 --> 3039.0400000000004
so

3034.4 --> 3042.319
i disagree on that big pint sailing

3039.04 --> 3042.319
rv definitely

3042.48 --> 3046.48
[Music]

3047.04 --> 3051.68
they don't have critical thinking they

3049.28 --> 3053.119
will also most likely not be listening

3051.68 --> 3054.64
now

3053.119 --> 3056.6400000000003
maybe

3054.64 --> 3058.8799999999997
but curiosity

3056.64 --> 3061.839
even without critical thinking can pull

3058.88 --> 3063.839
people very far

3061.839 --> 3066.64
and gives them a new opportunity to

3063.839 --> 3067.68
rekindle to reignite critical thinking

3066.64 --> 3069.92
right

3067.68 --> 3072.3999999999996
critical thinking

3069.92 --> 3074.8
is kind of dependent on curiosity if you

3072.4 --> 3076.319
don't have natural curiosity then you

3074.8 --> 3078.7200000000003
then how are you going to develop

3076.319 --> 3079.92
critical thinking you don't have the

3078.72 --> 3082.3999999999996
impulse

3079.92 --> 3084.7200000000003
to start that process

3082.4 --> 3086.319
you see

3084.72 --> 3088.5589999999997
it's kind of all tied in with one

3086.319 --> 3089.52
another

3088.559 --> 3091.28
but

3089.52 --> 3093.44
i think there's plenty of people that

3091.28 --> 3095.3590000000004
watch me that that do have critical

3093.44 --> 3097.599
thinking skills

3095.359 --> 3098.5589999999997
you would kinda have to

3097.599 --> 3100.88
because

3098.559 --> 3103.28
i can be

3100.88 --> 3106.96
very out of order

3103.28 --> 3110.0
compared to how most people act

3106.96 --> 3112.48
like and it's not even like that i do

3110.0 --> 3113.52
things unjustified it's just that i'm

3112.48 --> 3116.8
very

3113.52 --> 3120.319
in the way that i conduct myself

3116.8 --> 3122.559
i up the spectrum of possibilities i get

3120.319 --> 3124.72
a lot more angry i get a lot more

3122.559 --> 3128.96
dominant i get a lot more

3124.72 --> 3128.9599999999996
emotional about things in general

3130.079 --> 3133.92
right

3131.04 --> 3135.04
not because i'm losing control when that

3133.92 --> 3137.52
happens

3135.04 --> 3139.2799999999997
i can control my emotions it's because i

3137.52 --> 3140.88
choose

3139.28 --> 3143.119
to let that

3140.88 --> 3145.76
be manifested

3143.119 --> 3148.319
i'm making a point doing that

3145.76 --> 3151.5200000000004
also it is therapeutical because being

3148.319 --> 3153.839
introvert naturally

3151.52 --> 3155.44
right having that in you to kind of lock

3153.839 --> 3158.72
yourself in and just

3155.44 --> 3161.599
just be the observer and not a reactor

3158.72 --> 3164.9599999999996
has been very unhealthy for me in my

3161.599 --> 3167.44
life very unhealthy

3164.96 --> 3170.64
so i'm doing this to kind of to save my

3167.44 --> 3173.839
own ass even save my own health

3170.64 --> 3177.44
and while i do that

3173.839 --> 3179.04
be an expose show what it is to be human

3177.44 --> 3181.04
like this

3179.04 --> 3183.119
show what is real

3181.04 --> 3187.119
to remind people

3183.119 --> 3189.52
what real feelings and real passions are

3187.119 --> 3190.48
and that they can definitely be a good

3189.52 --> 3193.28
thing

3190.48 --> 3195.2
when the mind is guided by

3193.28 --> 3197.52
good principles

3195.2 --> 3199.68
and when you can learn to admit a

3197.52 --> 3202.079
mistake when you made it

3199.68 --> 3205.5989999999997
that's a very important part that

3202.079 --> 3205.599
admitting a mistake part

3207.04 --> 3211.2799999999997
do i ever get loud with people in person

3212.8 --> 3218.0
well not as quickly as i tend to do here

3215.28 --> 3218.0
online no

3218.96 --> 3226.0
i can't be a bit dominant but even then

3221.92 --> 3228.2400000000002
i like don't i don't do it loud

3226.0 --> 3230.4
usually when things get loud is like

3228.24 --> 3231.9199999999996
when i'm anticipating like

3230.4 --> 3234.92
that there's gonna be violence or

3231.92 --> 3234.92
something

3239.2 --> 3242.0
so no

3240.64 --> 3246.0789999999997
it's

3242.0 --> 3246.079
me getting loud is extremely rare

3246.24 --> 3251.839
outside of

3248.079 --> 3251.8390000000004
facing the webcam and the mic

3254.59 --> 3257.7490000000003
[Music]

3260.64 --> 3265.68
dude but steamy trav like i'm kind of

3263.119 --> 3267.599
sensitive so i can't even afford that

3265.68 --> 3270.0789999999997
right there's people that can just be

3267.599 --> 3272.8
asses out there to face-to-face

3270.079 --> 3274.6400000000003
situations and like yeah

3272.8 --> 3279.52
i'm like dude

3274.64 --> 3280.48
if i am even grumpy like

3279.52 --> 3281.44
and

3280.48 --> 3285.2
like

3281.44 --> 3287.44
i snap a little at somebody in some way

3285.2 --> 3290.16
right here in the real world i almost

3287.44 --> 3291.44
get nightmares from that because it's

3290.16 --> 3295.52
like

3291.44 --> 3295.52
[ __ ] why wasn't i just polite

3296.079 --> 3301.2000000000003
like i really don't allow myself to like

3300.079 --> 3305.079
do that

3301.2 --> 3305.0789999999997
in face-to-face situations

3306.24 --> 3312.799
because i like get so nervous afterwards

3308.88 --> 3315.0
like what if i really hurt him

3312.799 --> 3318.059
or her

3315.0 --> 3318.059
[Music]

3320.88 --> 3325.76
right but online is different

3323.04 --> 3328.64
or when i'm with friends it's different

3325.76 --> 3329.599
because that's the one big difference

3328.64 --> 3331.839
with

3329.599 --> 3335.04
people that i actually really trust to a

3331.839 --> 3336.799
spiritual level i do like do that i do

3335.04 --> 3339.119
do the same thing as

3336.799 --> 3339.119
here

3339.2 --> 3343.9199999999996
because i am naturally

3341.92 --> 3346.0
loud

3343.92 --> 3348.799
and a lot

3346.0 --> 3351.599
i used to say i'm three people i'm three

3348.799 --> 3354.24
people stuck in one

3351.599 --> 3356.079
and yeah there's some weird implications

3354.24 --> 3358.4799999999996
with that but

3356.079 --> 3360.1600000000003
it is i'm like too much for the average

3358.48 --> 3362.72
person

3360.16 --> 3366.16
you could call that hyperactive

3362.72 --> 3368.72
it effectively is although i'm not like

3366.16 --> 3368.72
not like that

3368.799 --> 3373.7599999999998
not hyperactive like that but

3371.839 --> 3375.2799999999997
it's like i took that

3373.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
loose

3375.28 --> 3379.6800000000003
hyperactivism

3377.839 --> 3382.5589999999997
chained it and then

3379.68 --> 3384.24
compacted it all into a normal format

3382.559 --> 3388.92
and that's what i am

3384.24 --> 3388.9199999999996
that's how i am i'm just more intense

3392.0 --> 3394.24
uh

3396.319 --> 3400.92
i'll take that as a compliment then yeah

3404.0 --> 3409.44
i never get furious to anybody that i

3406.4 --> 3409.44
don't really trust

3412.48 --> 3419.079
will the real arwen please stand up i'm

3415.04 --> 3419.079
real i'm right here

3419.2 --> 3422.799
i don't know why i should stand up but

3428.72 --> 3433.839
oh

3429.68 --> 3433.839
my god i thought it was my computer

3440.24 --> 3443.52
which is the real person

3444.64 --> 3447.64
both

3452.24 --> 3456.839
yes it is g trinity indeed

3486.839 --> 3491.839
look

3488.4 --> 3493.44
me getting loud online is not extremely

3491.839 --> 3495.2
rare

3493.44 --> 3498.319
me getting loud in face-to-face

3495.2 --> 3500.0789999999997
situations is extremely rare because

3498.319 --> 3502.72
even if i

3500.079 --> 3505.28
like heighten my tone beyond how i'm

3502.72 --> 3507.5989999999997
talking right now if i get a little bit

3505.28 --> 3508.88
more enthusiastic people already get

3507.599 --> 3510.7200000000003
nervous

3508.88 --> 3512.799
okay

3510.72 --> 3515.359
can you imagine what would happen when i

3512.799 --> 3518.72
go full rate you into somebody's face

3515.359 --> 3519.839
they'll [ __ ] their pants dude

3518.72 --> 3524.16
they will

3519.839 --> 3528.359
they will be genuinely frightened and

3524.16 --> 3528.359
why the hell would i do that

3543.839 --> 3549.119
yes i know it was a joke godzilla you

3546.48 --> 3550.319
know that i like to take jokes

3549.119 --> 3552.0
then

3550.319 --> 3554.24
erase

3552.0 --> 3556.64
the information about it being a joke

3554.24 --> 3559.839
from my mind and then give it a full

3556.64 --> 3559.839
analysis and reply

3698.88 --> 3703.92
but they look see it like this they know

3702.0 --> 3706.079
they've lost

3703.92 --> 3709.76
so this is all just like

3706.079 --> 3711.8390000000004
oh oh we have not lost hahaha

3709.76 --> 3714.48
but they know they've lost that why they

3711.839 --> 3717.0389999999998
don't come in

3714.48 --> 3719.2
it's all bluff now

3717.039 --> 3722.4
it was always all bluff right the entire

3719.2 --> 3724.64
globe religion is a giant bluff but

3722.4 --> 3726.88
what they're doing now is just bluffing

3724.64 --> 3729.5989999999997
to kind of like

3726.88 --> 3730.48
gaslight themselves

3729.599 --> 3732.079
like

3730.48 --> 3734.16
like they can they're still on the

3732.079 --> 3738.28
winning side they're just gaslighting

3734.16 --> 3738.2799999999997
themselves again

3747.92 --> 3755.039
but you gotta realize too gortilla that

3751.839 --> 3757.68
it is perfectly fine to just make fun of

3755.039 --> 3761.3590000000004
them being chat skanks and never

3757.68 --> 3762.8799999999997
actually joining the show so

3761.359 --> 3767.24
you know

3762.88 --> 3767.2400000000002
i mean they're still gonna feel that

3768.559 --> 3771.92
and eventually there's always going to

3770.16 --> 3775.2799999999997
be somebody that's going to roll in

3771.92 --> 3777.76
there like a kumu virus or a

3775.28 --> 3780.92

3817.599 --> 3824.76
you don't go there

3820.4 --> 3824.76
talking about fed chat

3827.599 --> 3831.76
right well i do go there because i have

3829.28 --> 3834.88
a moderator function but

3831.76 --> 3837.5200000000004
yeah it's just the place where the

3834.88 --> 3840.2400000000002
like chat scanker is allowed that's what

3837.52 --> 3842.0
what that chat is for like i allow

3840.24 --> 3844.0
ballers in my chat

3842.0 --> 3845.359
but i do not allow them behaving

3844.0 --> 3847.92
terribly

3845.359 --> 3850.24
so if they have some kind of

3847.92 --> 3850.2400000000002
beef

3850.319 --> 3856.079
based on the philosophical convictions

3854.0 --> 3857.359
like they're gonna have to keep a bit of

3856.079 --> 3858.1600000000003
a lid on it

3857.359 --> 3860.16
right

3858.16 --> 3862.24
and that also means that we don't poke

3860.16 --> 3864.48
them too hard

3862.24 --> 3868.24
sure we can make fun of ballers in here

3864.48 --> 3870.799
you do but just don't overdo it right

3868.24 --> 3874.16
don't be like

3870.799 --> 3874.16
don't be a monster about it

3875.039 --> 3878.4
but you guys i think most of you guys in

3876.799 --> 3881.0389999999998
chat really get that

3878.4 --> 3884.7200000000003
i mean sometimes terror 306 gets a bit

3881.039 --> 3884.7200000000003
carried away right territ

3887.44 --> 3894.88
or gadget inspector you know what i mean

3890.799 --> 3898.48
but most of you get it this is a place

3894.88 --> 3901.52
where philosophical convictions

3898.48 --> 3901.52
come secondary

3902.64 --> 3907.44
you go after virus a lot i know godzilla

3905.839 --> 3910.799
but he likes that though you got to

3907.44 --> 3913.52
realize that he is like a ragdoll figure

3910.799 --> 3915.68
he like he is perfectly fine with people

3913.52 --> 3919.599
attacking him like he kind of likes it

3915.68 --> 3923.839
he's a bit of a masochist like that

3919.599 --> 3927.2000000000003
did i call you yeah yeah

3923.839 --> 3927.2
now i was just saying that

3927.44 --> 3933.039
you can sometimes get a little bit over

3930.0 --> 3936.0
the top pissed off at like ballers even

3933.039 --> 3937.76
in my chat

3936.0 --> 3940.88
and that i get that

3937.76 --> 3944.3590000000004
like we're anticipating that

3940.88 --> 3944.359
so that's fine

3952.0 --> 3956.319
just playing his role i don't know

3954.799 --> 3958.079
is it a role

3956.319 --> 3962.22
i think it's really him

3958.079 --> 3964.079
i mean i think he is really like that

3962.22 --> 3966.8799999999997
[Music]

3964.079 --> 3968.6400000000003
i mean his personality doesn't seem

3966.88 --> 3969.92
unnatural to me

3968.64 --> 3970.799
seems very

3969.92 --> 3973.839
much

3970.799 --> 3976.16
naturally like that

3973.839 --> 3979.16
he's probably exactly like that in real

3976.16 --> 3979.16
life

3983.119 --> 3987.44
i hate the regular actors no genuine

3984.96 --> 3990.0
ballers left well they're left

3987.44 --> 3992.7200000000003
they're just not seeking out flat earth

3990.0 --> 3994.799
debate because then

3992.72 --> 3999.0389999999998
they either turn into an anti-flat

3994.799 --> 4001.28
earther or they become a flat earther

3999.039 --> 4001.28
right

4001.359 --> 4007.839
so we're just dealing with like the

4003.76 --> 4008.96
anti-flat earther leftovers

4007.839 --> 4012.0
there is

4008.96 --> 4014.88
ballers bumping into fed

4012.0 --> 4017.52
and then they start to figure things out

4014.88 --> 4021.2000000000003
very quickly and look it up and then

4017.52 --> 4023.28
realize like oh [ __ ] this is not what i

4021.2 --> 4025.1189999999997
thought it was

4023.28 --> 4028.2400000000002
it's fake

4025.119 --> 4028.2400000000002
like they tricked us

4029.52 --> 4035.28
and then they're not

4031.76 --> 4037.599
actual ballers anymore

4035.28 --> 4039.8390000000004
right but the ones that can't handle

4037.599 --> 4041.44
that and will double down on it anyway

4039.839 --> 4042.799
those are the anti-flat earthers and

4041.44 --> 4046.2400000000002
that's the one you get to see

4042.799 --> 4049.359
unfortunately terra 306 it's

4046.24 --> 4051.5989999999997
it's meant to be

4049.359 --> 4053.839
hey susie s

4051.599 --> 4053.839
what

4053.92 --> 4056.16
is it

4057.68 --> 4060.68
sometimes

4062.16 --> 4068.319
i i mean yeah can't deny that sometimes

4065.039 --> 4070.3190000000004
he acts like very bad

4068.319 --> 4072.4
has a weird poison

4070.319 --> 4074.88
streak to him sometimes

4072.4 --> 4076.7200000000003
it gets very bitter and dark

4074.88 --> 4080.6400000000003
but

4076.72 --> 4083.1189999999997
in general i i don't see him as

4080.64 --> 4087.72
like terrible

4083.119 --> 4087.7200000000003
i mean on the internet that is

4091.2 --> 4094.5589999999997

4093.52 --> 4097.04
like

4094.559 --> 4100.159000000001
what tara 306 says like fight the flat

4097.04 --> 4103.359

4108.159 --> 4113.92
phil b is like yeah

4110.799 --> 4114.84

yeah territories yeah phil b yeah you

4152.719 --> 4157.04
could definitely consider him to be well

4154.64 --> 4160.839

4188.88 --> 4192.4800000000005
i don't get it

4190.799 --> 4194.48

you

4194.48 --> 4197.12
yeah

4195.52 --> 4199.360000000001

4199.36 --> 4204.639999999999
earthers and globals

4201.36 --> 4204.639999999999

psychological warfare inside

4227.199 --> 4231.759999999999
have anything to do with their cosmology

4229.12 --> 4234.08
really are expanding their

4231.76 --> 4236.159000000001
psychological warfare tactics to keep

4234.08 --> 4239.12
themselves and others their followers

4236.159 --> 4241.759999999999
ignorant in a more efficient manner

there is constant development

4241.76 --> 4245.84
completely different directions

4246.4 --> 4251.5199999999995

brutally

4252.8 --> 4257.52
complete and total utter victory

getting a bit bored a bit disappointed

4307.52 --> 4313.1990000000005

4309.92 --> 4314.719

4313.199 --> 4316.159
all corpses

4314.719 --> 4317.92
lying dead

4602.48 --> 4606.5599999999995
have to sleep through all the heat

4604.56 --> 4608.56
that's terrible

4606.56 --> 4611.360000000001
so when when's this hot i really try to

4608.56 --> 4613.04
go to bed early

4611.36 --> 4616.08
it's much better

4613.04 --> 4616.08
you sleep much better

4617.73 --> 4620.849999999999
[Music]

4621.76 --> 4626.400000000001
all right see you later godzilla thanks

4623.679 --> 4628.8
for popping by

4626.4 --> 4633.36
right so i am almost going to round out

4628.8 --> 4633.360000000001
the show but first i want to ask again

4635.6 --> 4642.2390000000005
your show starts at 4am here oh

4639.52 --> 4645.1990000000005
oh you're on the

4642.239 --> 4647.5199999999995
on the west coast of the us

4645.199 --> 4651.839999999999
yeah i'm sorry i can't help you

4647.52 --> 4651.84
it's just really freaking early then

4653.92 --> 4659.6
i appreciate you getting up at that time

4658.0 --> 4661.199
but if you're going to get up at that

4659.6 --> 4664.8
time then also make sure you're going to

4661.199 --> 4664.799999999999
go to bed very early because

4668.08 --> 4672.0
you don't want to deprive yourself of

4670.159 --> 4674.239
the essential sleep

4672.0 --> 4676.8
especially if you're going to watch me

4674.239 --> 4680.239
because i do kind of tend to demand a

4676.8 --> 4684.400000000001
certain level of brain activity

4680.239 --> 4684.4
and you need plenty of sleep for that

4684.56 --> 4687.6
you're welcome son

4688.96 --> 4694.8
or should i say daughter

4691.28 --> 4694.8
uh anyhow

4695.52 --> 4700.96
yeah i wanted to ask again guys

4698.4 --> 4702.879999999999
i could really use some support if you

4700.96 --> 4706.32
like what i do

4702.88 --> 4708.719
i'm like that broke right now

4706.32 --> 4710.48
still gonna have like 15 euros tomorrow

4708.719 --> 4712.4800000000005
if i'm lucky

4710.48 --> 4714.799999999999
but yeah that's not

4712.48 --> 4716.5599999999995
enough to get me through another week if

4714.8 --> 4720.0
you know what i mean

4716.56 --> 4721.280000000001
so please i urge you if you can to

4720.0 --> 4723.28
support me

4721.28 --> 4724.8
through the paypal

4723.28 --> 4726.719
it's the only way i'm gonna get it quick

4724.8 --> 4731.1990000000005
enough

4726.719 --> 4731.199
otherwise i i will get hungry

4731.36 --> 4735.92
at the same time yeah prices of food

4734.239 --> 4739.28
here have risen

4735.92 --> 4739.28
pretty dramatically

4739.36 --> 4743.839999999999
it's a it's a

4741.36 --> 4746.96
problematic situation

4743.84 --> 4749.84
so i could really really use the support

4746.96 --> 4749.84
desperately

4754.8 --> 4758.96
please support your local arwin

4759.679 --> 4763.84
i don't know how long i can hold on here

4765.199 --> 4770.48
does dutch government give cost of

4767.6 --> 4771.679
living increases

4770.48 --> 4774.48
uh

4771.679 --> 4776.64
well they gave some like temporary bonus

4774.48 --> 4777.839999999999
thing

4776.64 --> 4780.08
but

4777.84 --> 4782.159000000001
yeah

4780.08 --> 4785.36
i don't know if that's enough it doesn't

4782.159 --> 4785.36
really seem like it

4789.76 --> 4794.64
so yeah i've had had some compensation

4792.8 --> 4796.56
but yeah i don't know if that actually

4794.64 --> 4798.64
measured up at the effective price

4796.56 --> 4801.120000000001
increase of the food

4798.64 --> 4801.12
right so

4803.199 --> 4808.5599999999995
i need support

4806.159 --> 4811.199
i kind of realized that my social

4808.56 --> 4813.360000000001
welfare has never been fully enough for

4811.199 --> 4815.759999999999
me to get around and that was always a

4813.36 --> 4815.759999999999
problem

4816.32 --> 4822.08
especially when i wasn't doing

4818.4 --> 4822.08
this when i wasn't doing youtube

4825.76 --> 4829.76
anyhow please support me if you can i

4828.159 --> 4832.799999999999
hope it's worth it i

4829.76 --> 4834.88
i do really do my best to put down

4832.8 --> 4837.1990000000005
interesting information and trains of

4834.88 --> 4840.4800000000005
thinking

4837.199 --> 4842.0
to hopefully spark your

4840.48 --> 4843.199
train of thinking

4842.0 --> 4845.6
into

4843.199 --> 4847.759999999999
taking ideas into directions that you

4845.6 --> 4850.0
normally don't really see out there

4847.76 --> 4852.08
because everybody just follows standard

4850.0 --> 4854.639
narrative structures

4852.08 --> 4856.4
it's just boring same old right well i

4854.639 --> 4860.12
like to really

4856.4 --> 4860.12
figure things out

4861.6 --> 4865.679
but i can't do it without some

4863.52 --> 4868.719
sponsorship

4865.679 --> 4870.159
so please donate to my paypal if you can

4868.719 --> 4872.56
little bits

4870.159 --> 4875.839999999999
or a big chunk

4872.56 --> 4875.84
anything would be great

4883.52 --> 4887.56
and let me know in chat

4898.32 --> 4900.639
what

4901.36 --> 4903.839999999999
bollywood

4910.159 --> 4915.199
okay so it's just

4912.159 --> 4917.839999999999
an indian space movie

4915.199 --> 4917.839999999999
oh yeah

4936.08 --> 4938.639
interesting

4938.96 --> 4941.6
cgi

4942.48 --> 4945.638999999999
is hilarious

4951.6 --> 4956.84
so that's like a genuine bollywood space

4954.48 --> 4960.879999999999
movie i guess

4956.84 --> 4962.4800000000005
huh thank you for that trailer terra 306

4960.88 --> 4966.679
funny

4962.48 --> 4966.678999999999
when is it supposed to come out

4988.0 --> 4991.6
am i watching the dr yeah i flicked

4989.84 --> 4994.96
through it i'm not literally gonna watch

4991.6 --> 4999.280000000001
it terri it's i can't listen to sound

4994.96 --> 5002.4
without having it play over the show so

4999.28 --> 5002.4
not a space movie

5004.719 --> 5009.04
an espionage

5006.96 --> 5012.639
within

5009.04 --> 5015.84
supposed space [ __ ] okay

5012.639 --> 5015.84
well that's unexpected

5016.719 --> 5019.36
all right

5017.6 --> 5021.84
watch it later then

5019.36 --> 5025.32
yeah i will

5021.84 --> 5025.32
thank you for that

5048.4 --> 5052.96
so did everybody just leave after i

5050.639 --> 5057.12
started asking for paypal donations

5052.96 --> 5060.639
again did did you all just leave

5057.12 --> 5060.639
are you all doing that bad

5061.92 --> 5064.639
i mean maybe

5065.84 --> 5068.4800000000005
changing up

5069.52 --> 5073.52
the bridge arc is the brick arch is

5072.239 --> 5076.32
getting old

5073.52 --> 5078.4800000000005
you know what i agree a bit

5076.32 --> 5081.36
steamy traveler i kind of want the arch

5078.48 --> 5083.599999999999
out of the way myself

5081.36 --> 5085.36
although it is still kind of nice it is

5083.6 --> 5087.92
i it's not getting that old but i kind

5085.36 --> 5090.08
of would like a little bit more of hand

5087.92 --> 5094.4400000000005
room if you know what i mean

5090.08 --> 5094.44
you're here ah good to see you

5102.639 --> 5109.36
all right but steamy traveler maybe like

5105.199 --> 5110.839999999999
in the after summer there might be a

5109.36 --> 5113.12
some

5110.84 --> 5115.12
transformation don't think like not

5113.12 --> 5117.199
during this heat

5115.12 --> 5120.159
but as soon as it starts to cool off

5117.199 --> 5122.719
like the summer's growing at an end

5120.159 --> 5124.08
i think there i'm i had already some

5122.719 --> 5127.04
ideas of

5124.08 --> 5129.5199999999995
like changing it around a bit

5127.04 --> 5130.8
so that will happen eventually

5129.52 --> 5133.280000000001
don't worry about it it's not going to

5130.8 --> 5136.92
be like exactly these visuals for

5133.28 --> 5136.92
another two years

5141.04 --> 5145.44
although i really do like my background

5143.199 --> 5145.44
uh

5146.159 --> 5150.159
the mountainscape the trees and all that

5148.48 --> 5153.799999999999
i really do like that so i'm definitely

5150.159 --> 5153.799999999999
gonna keep that one

5155.79 --> 5159.0
[Music]

5162.32 --> 5169.799999999999
something involving fractals no

5166.08 --> 5169.8
absolutely not

5171.92 --> 5177.88
no i'm not gonna do that

5174.0 --> 5177.88
i'm not gonna go abstract

5181.54 --> 5184.729
[Music]

5185.199 --> 5189.919999999999
no the fractal thinking is in the mind

5192.639 --> 5196.639
so unless you mean fractal in a sense of

5195.52 --> 5200.2390000000005
like

5196.639 --> 5203.12
jugand steel which has like a weird

5200.239 --> 5204.32
fractal nature to it in a way the way

5203.12 --> 5205.5199999999995
it's

5204.32 --> 5207.599999999999
designed

5205.52 --> 5208.96
that sort of style

5207.6 --> 5210.88
but

5208.96 --> 5213.36
no just no i'm not going to like oh

5210.88 --> 5216.56
mandelbrot

5213.36 --> 5216.5599999999995
pattern no

5217.6 --> 5222.8
that falls under abstract i'm not going

5220.0 --> 5224.88
to do that i don't like that as a visual

5222.8 --> 5227.76
it's good to be reminded about what it

5224.88 --> 5230.159000000001
is and what it does

5227.76 --> 5235.08
it's not a thing that necessarily would

5230.159 --> 5235.08
like a poster off or anything

5246.08 --> 5253.719
but maybe something like a wood frame

5249.44 --> 5253.719
instead of this stone arch

5270.08 --> 5275.04
looping earth graphic

5272.88 --> 5275.04
no

5276.96 --> 5282.08
there you dude

5279.76 --> 5283.84
don't know if you've taken notice but

5282.08 --> 5286.159
the standard

5283.84 --> 5288.719
video picture

5286.159 --> 5290.638999999999
the thumbnail for all my early bird

5288.719 --> 5295.84
shows are

5290.639 --> 5295.84
the rectangular looping model with space

5297.679 --> 5302.4400000000005
never thought of merch oh god

5309.92 --> 5315.1990000000005
yeah i thought about it

5312.159 --> 5317.28
but uh yeah it's not working i had a

5315.199 --> 5320.638999999999
like in the early bird show like in the

5317.28 --> 5320.639
early hundreds and all that

5321.199 --> 5325.36
i did kind of like try to think of

5323.44 --> 5327.5199999999995
something that i could do like

5325.36 --> 5329.679
merchandising

5327.52 --> 5332.400000000001
it's just

5329.679 --> 5334.4
i just don't want to do it

5332.4 --> 5336.719
like i feel like whatever i'm gonna do

5334.4 --> 5339.199
i'm gonna be sorry about it

5336.719 --> 5342.639
so far

5339.199 --> 5342.638999999999
buy an arwin t-shirt

5344.08 --> 5348.159
but it's not fair

5346.0 --> 5353.04
i

5348.159 --> 5355.759999999999
i don't wear printed t-shirts i don't

5353.04 --> 5358.159
try to take a notice of that

5355.76 --> 5358.159000000001
you know

5358.719 --> 5364.639
bubble hat for my never

5362.32 --> 5367.28
stevie traveler

5364.639 --> 5372.36
that's never

5367.28 --> 5372.36
i am not gonna be a freaking bobble head

5385.199 --> 5389.28
ridiculous no i'm not gonna do that

5389.52 --> 5392.92
a t

5393.84 --> 5397.679
that says keep it flat

5396.719 --> 5400.0
sure

5397.679 --> 5402.639
t-shirt right but

5400.0 --> 5404.88
that's fine but it's not i like i didn't

5402.639 --> 5406.88
even invent that

5404.88 --> 5408.08
keep it flat i got that from mark

5406.88 --> 5410.2390000000005
sergeant

5408.08 --> 5412.639
he's the one that said that

5410.239 --> 5416.919999999999
and patricia's there too and i was just

5412.639 --> 5416.92
like okay i say that now

5435.04 --> 5437.199
but

5436.32 --> 5438.0
maybe

5437.199 --> 5440.159
right

5438.0 --> 5442.239
things like the arwynian paradox or

5440.159 --> 5446.36
something i mean that would be worthy of

5442.239 --> 5446.36
putting on a t-shirt i guess

5451.76 --> 5456.0
maybe i have to like reconsider maybe i

5454.08 --> 5458.08
will at some point do something like

5456.0 --> 5459.28
that

5458.08 --> 5461.44
i just

5459.28 --> 5465.8
yeah

5461.44 --> 5465.799999999999
a bit headstrong about it

5494.0 --> 5497.92
yep no i will think about it

5499.199 --> 5505.678999999999
but right now like yeah this is all like

5502.4 --> 5508.0
things oh that might work

5505.679 --> 5509.679
right now it's not really going to work

5508.0 --> 5513.199
so right now

5509.679 --> 5513.1990000000005
didn't need money for food

5513.92 --> 5517.52
physicality assumption bias

5533.84 --> 5536.85
or

5534.719 --> 5539.12
yeah

5536.85 --> 5542.76
[Music]

5539.12 --> 5542.76
how about like

5546.08 --> 5550.239
celestial non-local hologram

5556.639 --> 5562.400000000001
i mean just those words would be like

5560.08 --> 5562.4
what

5562.48 --> 5567.879999999999
it's gonna be

5563.76 --> 5567.88
it's gonna draw people's attention

5568.02 --> 5578.8
[Music]

5575.36 --> 5580.799999999999
dude if you'd say like the sun is a

5578.8 --> 5583.4400000000005
non-local hologram that's gonna make

5580.8 --> 5583.4400000000005
people like

5584.159 --> 5587.28
spazz out maybe

5587.44 --> 5590.879999999999
i don't know

5588.96 --> 5594.0
but yeah there are things that i could

5590.88 --> 5594.0
put on a t-shirt

5594.08 --> 5600.12
and then perhaps sell it as

5597.12 --> 5600.12
merchandising

5607.35 --> 5610.499000000001
[Music]

5612.88 --> 5618.719
that will be funny by the way

5615.52 --> 5618.719
it's not even about it like

5619.52 --> 5623.280000000001
if you had like a t-shirt and on the

5621.36 --> 5627.04
front it would say

5623.28 --> 5628.719
the sun is a non-local hologram

5627.04 --> 5632.08
and then on the back

5628.719 --> 5633.6
it would say i'm not
