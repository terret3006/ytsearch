174.239 --> 177.76
wind and it's just

178.72 --> 183.68

cool off in a chair or something

187.92 --> 191.83999999999997
until like the rain hits and then yeah

232.48 --> 235.51899999999998
and yeah

235.84 --> 242.08
this show can

238.159 --> 243.84
basically become an extended show

242.08 --> 245.59900000000002
because nathan oakley is not doing a

243.84 --> 249.519
live show today

245.599 --> 251.2
he's celebrating eleanor's birthday

249.519 --> 254.239
oldest daughter

251.2 --> 256.079
so yeah i could just keep going if i

254.239 --> 258.23900000000003
feel like it

256.079 --> 261.44
i got an

258.239 --> 265.96
illuminati casa

261.44 --> 265.96
for backup i get hungry

266.08 --> 271.28
[Music]

269.12 --> 274.72
and i even got green tea because that's

271.28 --> 274.71999999999997
very doable with this weather

276.88 --> 282.56
right

279.04 --> 286.16
hello susie s

282.56 --> 286.16
you getting a wrench suzy

289.6 --> 294.759
i'm glad to have you in my chat these

291.759 --> 294.759
days

298.4 --> 304.63899999999995
right so first off

301.919 --> 306.79999999999995
i kind of want to to do a little test

304.639 --> 308.8
again

306.8 --> 310.479
because

308.8 --> 312.639
remember yesterday the

310.479 --> 315.039
my comment on quantum of consciousness

312.639 --> 315.039
video

315.919 --> 318.88
and

317.919 --> 324.35999999999996
well

318.88 --> 324.36
i'm wondering if it's stalling again

324.639 --> 328.08
because it seems yeah i just wanted to

327.12 --> 330.8
check

328.08 --> 333.12
if you guys can see my comment there

330.8 --> 333.12
still

333.199 --> 336.91900000000004
and if you can get enough

340.8 --> 344.8
so i'm going to put the link to the

342.479 --> 348.639
video i want you to kind of check you

344.8 --> 348.639
see my comment in chat

348.88 --> 353.8
brenda commented on it by the way

354.16 --> 357.44
but after that point it just

356.639 --> 361.52
seems

357.44 --> 361.52
i think it might be shadow banned again

361.68 --> 367.84000000000003
and that makes me think maybe this was

363.84 --> 367.84
actually matt himself doing that

369.919 --> 373.35999999999996
if that's the case i'm not sure

376.4 --> 378.63899999999995
hey

378.8 --> 382.88
you already checked i knew it

386.08 --> 389.56
what the hell

391.7 --> 394.75
[Music]

410.0 --> 415.12
right it seems that brenda commented

412.8 --> 416.319
like two hours after the comment was

415.12 --> 420.599
made

416.319 --> 420.599
and then it was locked up again

426.639 --> 430.28000000000003
what's going on

444.479 --> 446.479
right

445.599 --> 448.71999999999997
yeah

446.479 --> 450.71999999999997
can't say was my way too impressed by

448.72 --> 452.72
his video

450.72 --> 456.40000000000003
from yesterday

452.72 --> 456.40000000000003
so i don't know maybe he's

456.8 --> 460.88
i'm checking like all the comments by

458.8 --> 462.639
the way in the comment section they're

460.88 --> 465.36
all

462.639 --> 466.639
just like uh science is just completely

465.36 --> 469.639
useless they don't know what they're

466.639 --> 469.639
doing

490.16 --> 494.879
i think

491.36 --> 497.12
matt might be just going onto a tangent

494.879 --> 499.44
here

497.12 --> 501.36
in which case that means that i won't

499.44 --> 503.68
like him anymore

501.36 --> 506.68
if he's like truly just

503.68 --> 506.68
rejecting

506.879 --> 510.72
just the understanding of what science

509.039 --> 514.159
even is and he's

510.72 --> 518.8000000000001
i don't know like i don't

514.159 --> 518.8
it seems so such a way so useless

519.12 --> 521.839
dishonest

522.159 --> 528.56
like why is my comment getting removed

526.64 --> 530.54
shadowban

528.56 --> 533.7199999999999
why

530.54 --> 533.7199999999999
[Music]

537.2 --> 542.9590000000001
nathan's oakley's comment was visible

539.279 --> 542.959
and brenda left yes i know

546.0 --> 552.56
what are you saying you can still see

548.16 --> 552.56

554.64 --> 557.64
mike

569.69 --> 572.869
[Music]

585.68 --> 588.2399999999999
wait what

589.76 --> 593.2
what do you mean on nathan's

591.76 --> 594.48
are you saying nathan made his own

593.2 --> 597.48
comment

594.48 --> 597.48
separately

611.279 --> 614.279
hmm

616.3 --> 619.3499999999999
[Music]

620.399 --> 623.519
i'm not finding it

627.92 --> 631.88

635.97 --> 646.15
[Music]

651.519 --> 655.5600000000001
right yeah i see is coming

666.56 --> 671.0
like why is this why is this happening

683.2 --> 688.5600000000001
why why are my comments like this is

685.92 --> 691.4399999999999
like very frustrating

688.56 --> 691.4399999999999
like this hurts

691.519 --> 697.2
i just want to communicate

693.76 --> 701.88
why why is it getting removed

697.2 --> 701.88
like what the hell is going on here

733.6 --> 738.72
i delete comments

735.839 --> 741.44
oh you mean really disgusting

738.72 --> 745.839
sickening evil comments

741.44 --> 745.839
that are just personal attacks

746.72 --> 750.24
yeah

747.92 --> 750.24
i do

754.8 --> 760.079
what the [ __ ]

756.32 --> 762.24
does that have to do with anything

760.079 --> 764.56
what you think other people on youtube

762.24 --> 769.24
don't delete comments from troll

764.56 --> 769.2399999999999
[ __ ] you think so

781.839 --> 787.839
have i noticed it on any other channels

785.519 --> 787.839
no

788.32 --> 795.519
but i rarely even leave comments

792.32 --> 797.519
it's very rare when i do it i do it with

795.519 --> 800.16
a good reason and i'm like

797.519 --> 802.72
having attention for it right like i did

800.16 --> 802.7199999999999
yesterday

803.04 --> 807.12
especially if i'm sort of reaching out

813.36 --> 817.44
i delete stuff i don't agree with

818.88 --> 822.72
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

822.88 --> 828.68
you're still here and you're just a

825.199 --> 831.68
stupid ass

828.68 --> 835.12
[Music]

831.68 --> 837.519
you're just at homing whining like oh i

835.12 --> 840.0
delete videos oh that's a good enough

837.519 --> 842.639
reason to just get shadow man because i

840.0 --> 844.16
delete pieces of [ __ ] troll

842.639 --> 847.279
comments oh

844.16 --> 847.279
yes of course

848.56 --> 853.1199999999999
you're not insulting me okay so what the

850.639 --> 855.279
[ __ ] is the point then you really think

853.12 --> 857.6
that that is the reason you think that

855.279 --> 860.8
matt is shadow banning me out of

857.6 --> 863.1990000000001
principle because he's so angry that i

860.8 --> 864.639
delete troll comments

863.199 --> 869.079
really

864.639 --> 869.0790000000001
is that your argument here

874.89 --> 878.08
[Music]

883.12 --> 890.5600000000001
they are restricting my channel

886.72 --> 890.5600000000001
how what what's going on

890.72 --> 894.76
how are they even doing that

901.76 --> 905.6
and how is that even possible

909.92 --> 914.16
i mean they could like try to report me

912.8 --> 916.56
everywhere

914.16 --> 919.199
but if it's just [ __ ] and is

916.56 --> 921.92
obviously not true

919.199 --> 924.7199999999999
all they're gonna get is getting flagged

921.92 --> 927.12
for falsely reporting

924.72 --> 929.519
that's what happens when you just report

927.12 --> 932.519
everything from somebody it makes no

929.519 --> 932.519
sense

948.16 --> 952.8389999999999
they flag my channel how

957.44 --> 965.519
re so gadget you you really think that

960.0 --> 965.519
this is the ballers doing do you gadget

966.56 --> 970.399
i mean what the hell does this have to

968.24 --> 973.36
do with

970.399 --> 977.8
my comment getting shadow banned

973.36 --> 977.8000000000001
on quantum of consciousness channel

1010.399 --> 1014.32
this is all nonsense like matt doesn't

1012.48 --> 1016.88
even have

1014.32 --> 1021.24
wait until approved

1016.88 --> 1021.24
comments it's you make a comment

1039.28 --> 1045.039
they said they have my channel

1041.679 --> 1047.2800000000002
restricted oh really they said that yeah

1045.039 --> 1050.16
they also say you can

1047.28 --> 1053.36
you can get a uh

1050.16 --> 1056.0800000000002
elevation height angle of elevation from

1053.36 --> 1058.6399999999999
a curved baseline they also say that

1056.08 --> 1061.9189999999999
gadget inspector they say a lot of very

1058.64 --> 1064.16
stupid things and then they believe that

1061.919 --> 1066.72
it's true

1064.16 --> 1069.1200000000001
you shouldn't fall for their own gas

1066.72 --> 1069.1200000000001
lighting

1074.96 --> 1079.919
i mean the only way they could

1077.679 --> 1081.44
restrict my channel is from actually

1079.919 --> 1082.4
getting me

1081.44 --> 1084.72
banned

1082.4 --> 1086.64
getting me struck whatever and then it's

1084.72 --> 1088.72
gone like that's the only thing that

1086.64 --> 1089.8400000000001
could actually be the result of

1088.72 --> 1093.039
something

1089.84 --> 1096.1599999999999
that they wanted to do

1093.039 --> 1099.4
i'm not getting bad like they can't it's

1096.16 --> 1099.4
not happening

1106.99 --> 1110.17
[Music]

1127.93 --> 1131.1190000000001
[Music]

1134.64 --> 1139.2800000000002
not nice being shadow man no it's not

1137.2 --> 1142.72
just not nice

1139.28 --> 1142.72
it's borderline criminal

1147.44 --> 1152.24
i mean censorship is one thing but if

1149.919 --> 1153.3600000000001
you're being shadow banned secretly

1152.24 --> 1154.48
removed

1153.36 --> 1157.1999999999998
without

1154.48 --> 1158.799
you actually noticing it unless you test

1157.2 --> 1160.96
it

1158.799 --> 1165.0
that's just evil

1160.96 --> 1165.0
it's just evil

1186.64 --> 1189.64
um

1200.64 --> 1205.24
lots of effie channels do what

1206.64 --> 1210.7990000000002
shadow band people

1208.24 --> 1213.2
yeah those channels suck

1210.799 --> 1215.76
i hate those channels

1213.2 --> 1218.8400000000001
i don't watch those channels those are

1215.76 --> 1222.24
actual circle circle

1218.84 --> 1224.3999999999999
jerking echo chambers

1222.24 --> 1227.039
that really suck and become very

1224.4 --> 1227.039
degenerate

1229.039 --> 1233.44
i mean every channels that have like

1231.2 --> 1237.919
live shows and live chats that shadow

1233.44 --> 1237.919
band me i just don't watch them anymore

1245.679 --> 1251.76
i have things to say i'm not a troll

1251.84 --> 1255.12
i have

1252.799 --> 1257.679
insights

1255.12 --> 1260.6399999999999
i have ideas

1257.679 --> 1262.799
and i want to share them

1260.64 --> 1264.159
and if people don't want that and they

1262.799 --> 1267.36
don't want me

1264.159 --> 1267.3600000000001
then i don't want them

1267.84 --> 1272.3999999999999
then you can just sit in your weird

1270.64 --> 1275.4
little

1272.4 --> 1275.4
circle

1277.36 --> 1283.36
and let entropy do the rest because

1279.44 --> 1283.3600000000001
you're not like you're not open

1284.96 --> 1289.2
how many people have i banned i think

1286.799 --> 1291.84
about

1289.2 --> 1291.8400000000001
10 probably

1294.0 --> 1300.0
about 10 people

1296.48 --> 1302.72
in the last in this year

1300.0 --> 1304.4
and the rest it's all stock accounts

1302.72 --> 1306.64
it's all the same people

1304.4 --> 1309.2800000000002
it's just the same people making more

1306.64 --> 1309.2800000000002
sock accounts

1310.96 --> 1315.44
so

1313.12 --> 1317.52

1465.039 --> 1470.08
point about anything ever

1467.44 --> 1473.8400000000001
but whining about how somebody conducts

1470.08 --> 1473.84
themselves in their show

1474.88 --> 1479.3600000000001
yeah

1476.799 --> 1481.36

you

1481.36 --> 1486.3999999999999

1808.88 --> 1813.2
without any paypals or anything i mean

1814.88 --> 1821.7990000000002
not getting any richer doing this

1818.32 --> 1821.799
without that

1823.039 --> 1828.399
but yeah i mean the temperature is great

1827.279 --> 1830.159
i don't

1828.399 --> 1832.7199999999998
the funny thing is i kind of did my

1830.159 --> 1835.8600000000001
groceries yesterday for today it's

1832.72 --> 1838.799
almost like i knew it was coming

1835.86 --> 1842.4799999999998
[Music]

1838.799 --> 1842.48
but i had a really good sleep

1845.679 --> 1853.8400000000001
and i feel pretty awake right now

1849.36 --> 1853.84
so could going keep going quickly

1859.039 --> 1863.12
hmm

1860.159 --> 1865.44
okay was it yeah well there's sometimes

1863.12 --> 1868.7199999999998
it's weird

1865.44 --> 1870.88
it's like even live chats

1868.72 --> 1873.76
sometimes i'm somewhere like for example

1870.88 --> 1875.2
on jim bob's it seems to happen a lot

1873.76 --> 1876.399
it has nothing to do with him i'm

1875.2 --> 1881.039
certain

1876.399 --> 1883.6
where i comment and then it just like

1881.039 --> 1885.76
waits a few seconds and then it's like

1883.6 --> 1886.7199999999998
it appears in gray like oh there's an

1885.76 --> 1890.0
error

1886.72 --> 1893.76
error try again

1890.0 --> 1897.84
like where the hell did that come from

1893.76 --> 1897.84
it's super obstructive

1899.84 --> 1904.559
i've had it lit that that happens like

1901.76 --> 1906.559
three times in a row it made no sense

1904.559 --> 1907.84
because everybody else just continues

1906.559 --> 1909.12
commenting

1907.84 --> 1912.12
or chatting

1909.12 --> 1912.12

1948.72 --> 1954.159
oh really george okay so you buy big and

1951.679 --> 1956.799
then you store it right if you have the

1954.159 --> 1956.7990000000002
room for that

1957.76 --> 1962.039

1969.519 --> 1972.96
right but anyway glad to hear that my

1971.279 --> 1977.08

1991.91 --> 1997.76
[Music]

1994.799 --> 2000.8799999999999

1997.76 --> 2003.2
that matt would give a reply to it

2000.88 --> 2007.72
he has given replies to others but i

2003.2 --> 2007.72
guess his mind is not added

2010.83 --> 2013.8899999999999
[Music]

2070.48 --> 2074.48

2361.359 --> 2366.16
is there a specific list of words banned

2363.52 --> 2366.16
on youtube

2370.96 --> 2374.0
i don't i don't know if it's official

2372.8 --> 2375.8390000000004
though they just

2374.0 --> 2379.2
they just did it they just make it

2375.839 --> 2381.359
impossible for you to type those words

2379.2 --> 2384.3199999999997
it's different per platform other

2381.359 --> 2387.68
platforms also have certain words banned

2384.32 --> 2387.6800000000003
different words even so

2387.92 --> 2392.88
but yeah the word [ __ ]

2391.04 --> 2397.0
is definitely one of those words in the

2392.88 --> 2397.0
youtube chats and all that

2423.28 --> 2426.7200000000003
oh big clouds coming over

2429.119 --> 2431.839
remember yesterday i talked about those

2431.04 --> 2433.599
big

2431.839 --> 2435.34
billowing clouds

2433.599 --> 2438.6690000000003
look at that

2435.34 --> 2438.6690000000003

2438.96 --> 2442.599
oh that's a cloud

2463.599 --> 2467.839
it's great though

2465.119 --> 2467.839
i do not mind

2473.76 --> 2478.7200000000003
and like i'm seeing birds also just

2476.64 --> 2480.96
really like

2478.72 --> 2482.1699999999996
sitting in places and just sitting there

2480.96 --> 2483.359
letting the wind just go

2482.17 --> 2486.64
[Music]

2483.359 --> 2488.4
i'm seeing it all the time

2486.64 --> 2490.319
especially this morning just the birds

2488.4 --> 2492.0
just sitting there in the wind just like

2490.319 --> 2495.48
oh

2492.0 --> 2495.48
this is nice

2495.68 --> 2502.0789999999997
is it supposed to storm up today yeah

2499.04 --> 2505.88
over here it is at least

2502.079 --> 2505.88
i don't know about australia

2512.079 --> 2516.2000000000003
public hair what

2523.76 --> 2526.7200000000003
none of them are getting yeah tear it no

2525.68 --> 2529.1189999999997
it's just

2526.72 --> 2532.4399999999996
that they just don't want that

2529.119 --> 2532.44
in the chat

2572.319 --> 2575.319
huh

2587.76 --> 2593.2400000000002
okay

2589.359 --> 2593.24
yeah tear it that

2593.76 --> 2597.7200000000003
that could work i guess

2606.64 --> 2612.24
if you defend someone they should have a

2609.28 --> 2612.2400000000002
right to redress

2612.48 --> 2618.079
well i didn't really defame

2615.04 --> 2621.92
anybody it's just called criticism

2618.079 --> 2624.6400000000003
i mean i leave proper criticism in my

2621.92 --> 2626.4
comment section too there's guys that do

2624.64 --> 2628.64
that

2626.4 --> 2633.0
sometimes it's even a bit annoying and i

2628.64 --> 2633.0
still just gonna like leave it

2634.72 --> 2638.0789999999997
bundle of sticks yeah you could use you

2636.48 --> 2639.839
could describe it that way i mean

2638.079 --> 2642.2400000000002
there's

2639.839 --> 2645.74
plenty of alternative descriptions that

2642.24 --> 2648.83
would be pointers at the word [ __ ]

2665.86 --> 2669.079
[Music]

2674.079 --> 2680.1600000000003
yeah well in this case i thought that

2677.68 --> 2682.56
i just thought that

2680.16 --> 2685.7599999999998
what matt did especially in the face of

2682.56 --> 2687.68
feynman feinman was just

2685.76 --> 2689.3590000000004
of poor taste

2687.68 --> 2692.48
and i didn't really think it was funny

2689.359 --> 2695.839
so i just felt like i had to

2692.48 --> 2695.839
address the entire thing

2696.64 --> 2703.1189999999997
it was just downplaying it

2700.079 --> 2705.44
not giving it the credit it deserves and

2703.119 --> 2706.2400000000002
yeah that's why i just had to comment on

2705.44 --> 2707.68
it

2706.24 --> 2710.0789999999997
and it got shadow banned and i thought

2707.68 --> 2712.0789999999997
it was got that it got shadow banned the

2710.079 --> 2714.6400000000003
second time but apparently it's not

2712.079 --> 2717.119
thank goodness

2714.64 --> 2719.839
people have still been able to find it

2717.119 --> 2719.839
back

2725.68 --> 2728.0
right

2727.2 --> 2730.96
look

2728.0 --> 2733.68
professor phil bell i'm not saying that

2730.96 --> 2735.04
nobody should have the right to moderate

2733.68 --> 2737.5989999999997
right

2735.04 --> 2737.599
of course

2743.28 --> 2751.0400000000004
but look if somebody's gonna troll

2746.56 --> 2751.04
and it is cheap and it's annoying

2751.119 --> 2755.119
then yeah

2752.4 --> 2757.92
who why would you then talk to them like

2755.119 --> 2759.44
hey could you please not talk to me in

2757.92 --> 2762.2400000000002
that tone

2759.44 --> 2764.319
no you'd [ __ ] kick them out but

2762.24 --> 2767.2799999999997
that's why i don't

2764.319 --> 2768.16
talk like that in comments to anybody

2767.28 --> 2771.599
ever

2768.16 --> 2771.5989999999997
i really don't do that

2771.839 --> 2775.359
and

2772.64 --> 2778.7999999999997
so then when my comments get removed it

2775.359 --> 2778.7999999999997
feels like what what the hell

2781.359 --> 2787.0
like i'm not just a troll why did you

2783.599 --> 2787.0
remove that

2790.88 --> 2796.0
barely make comments anyway

2793.76 --> 2798.96
it's not like i'm constantly

2796.0 --> 2802.4
talking somebody constantly with on a

2798.96 --> 2806.76
daily basis with shitty comments i but i

2802.4 --> 2806.76
got plenty of those on my back

2820.64 --> 2826.16
oh okay psych bear

2823.839 --> 2831.0789999999997
they got a list of quotes

2826.16 --> 2831.0789999999997
yeah well that list is pretty big

2834.16 --> 2836.3999999999996
what

2839.2 --> 2843.0
yeah with two g's

2856.319 --> 2860.8
but yeah was it that is that it will

2858.96 --> 2862.48
work

2860.8 --> 2865.04
if you want to say the word you could

2862.48 --> 2867.68
just use two g's and then it means

2865.04 --> 2867.68
something else

2868.48 --> 2873.319
according to the algorithm so yeah

2889.359 --> 2893.359
it's very fun to hear it in baller

2891.68 --> 2894.8799999999997
priest's own word yeah of course it's

2893.359 --> 2897.04
amazing

2894.88 --> 2899.6800000000003
i prefer personally i prefer like

2897.04 --> 2901.599
quantum erasers numpty clips

2899.68 --> 2903.9199999999996
because he's been collecting them for a

2901.599 --> 2907.52

2903.92 --> 2907.52
hilarious videos with them

2907.599 --> 2915.839
have you ever checked them out psycbear

i doubt it

2996.64 --> 3001.5989999999997
yeah that's you again with the bi flat

2998.64 --> 3002.96
[ __ ] i'm not gonna kick you by the way

3001.599 --> 3006.6400000000003
but

3002.96 --> 3006.64
it makes no sense

3006.72 --> 3010.9599999999996
like

3007.68 --> 3012.5589999999997
this is this can never be united

3010.96 --> 3015.359
within physics

3012.559 --> 3015.3590000000004
you could never

3015.52 --> 3021.68
justify

3017.92 --> 3024.88
the idea of two opposing flat disks it's

3021.68 --> 3024.8799999999997
ridiculous i'm sorry

3025.2 --> 3029.04
that's just not the physical reality

3030.079 --> 3033.04
they're french yeah

3034.079 --> 3038.8390000000004
and so is gadget inspector by the way or

3036.64 --> 3041.2
at least he's an

3038.839 --> 3045.4
irishman that's

3041.2 --> 3045.3999999999996
adapted to being french

3067.599 --> 3071.04
i wait

3068.96 --> 3074.079
a week you're proof that it's not you

3071.04 --> 3076.48
don't have it's ridiculous it's not two

3074.079 --> 3079.52
opposing planes

3076.48 --> 3081.28
the earth is flat it's flat and level

3079.52 --> 3083.599
and parallel

3081.28 --> 3086.6400000000003
all the way

3083.599 --> 3090.2400000000002
you can't have two sides of the same

3086.64 --> 3092.72
coin being parallel

3090.24 --> 3094.4799999999996
it's one flat thing

3092.72 --> 3098.16
not

3094.48 --> 3100.48
too flat on the opposing sides it's just

3098.16 --> 3100.48
dude

3101.52 --> 3105.079
makes no sense

3122.079 --> 3125.079
hmm

3130.72 --> 3137.3999999999996
i'm a small potato

3133.28 --> 3137.4
okay matthew hall

3146.24 --> 3150.9599999999996
just three reasons why i already gave

3148.64 --> 3152.7999999999997
you them

3150.96 --> 3155.359
you can't have

3152.8 --> 3158.48
a flat plane

3155.359 --> 3161.359
being in opposition to itself

3158.48 --> 3162.8
it's flat all the way it's not going in

3161.359 --> 3165.92
a corner

3162.8 --> 3166.8
or suddenly you have to make a 180

3165.92 --> 3169.119
degree

3166.8 --> 3169.119
turn

3169.359 --> 3174.7999999999997
divide it over whatever space in order

3171.839 --> 3178.4
to reach the other flat side it just

3174.8 --> 3178.4
makes absolutely no sense

3178.72 --> 3182.3999999999996
so let's celestials fear this and that

3180.0 --> 3184.72
yeah yeah but that's oh yeah oh it works

3182.4 --> 3186.8
so nice is that just cute yeah that's

3184.72 --> 3190.64
the nice thing

3186.8 --> 3193.3590000000004
about celestial projections yeah

3190.64 --> 3195.68
it's a map projection it's the same

3193.359 --> 3197.839
problem like with every map

3195.68 --> 3200.72
it's not the terrain

3197.839 --> 3204.16
so oh it works so well wow that's really

3200.72 --> 3205.359
nice yeah so did the globe sort of

3204.16 --> 3208.96
but

3205.359 --> 3211.44
it isn't that though it's flat all the

3208.96 --> 3213.359
way so it's really nice how it works

3211.44 --> 3215.92
it's very useful for

3213.359 --> 3218.88
for navigation i guess your model that's

3215.92 --> 3221.04
nice oh cool very cool flat navigation

3218.88 --> 3224.1600000000003
model or something

3221.04 --> 3226.48
but it isn't literally that that's not

3224.16 --> 3229.2
the realm that's not physical euclidean

3226.48 --> 3229.2
reality

3229.28 --> 3234.7200000000003
doesn't matter if it works really well

3232.319 --> 3237.44
with celestial navigation i don't know

3234.72 --> 3239.7599999999998
if it even does but you say it is

3237.44 --> 3242.559
it doesn't matter it's not physical

3239.76 --> 3246.7200000000003
reality the earth is not

3242.559 --> 3248.96
two flat plains opposing one another

3246.72 --> 3252.8799999999997
and then having a weird little corner

3248.96 --> 3252.88
somewhere that makes absolutely no sense

3253.28 --> 3255.76
serious

3256.8 --> 3260.96
i have an alternative that's much more

3258.64 --> 3263.1189999999997
viable and that is a rectangular looping

3260.96 --> 3265.119
confined

3263.119 --> 3267.92
oh

3265.119 --> 3270.96
yeah loop oh yeah loop well i'm sorry

3267.92 --> 3273.44
that you don't like loop some of you

3270.96 --> 3275.839
it's just ah that makes no sense i mean

3273.44 --> 3279.68
i can't imagine yeah you can it's been

3275.839 --> 3283.2
even displayed in science fiction series

3279.68 --> 3284.8799999999997
and movies like the matrix

3283.2 --> 3287.52
and star trek

3284.88 --> 3290.2400000000002
even the original series

3287.52 --> 3291.7599999999998
it's looping space it's the space itself

3290.24 --> 3294.4799999999996
is the wormhole

3291.76 --> 3297.0400000000004
the realm would be a wormhole

3294.48 --> 3301.04
like if the entire thing is a wormhole

3297.04 --> 3303.119
loops the space loops in on itself

3301.04 --> 3305.359
it's just continual with the limited

3303.119 --> 3308.559
amount of volume

3305.359 --> 3308.5589999999997
a continual loop

3309.04 --> 3314.72
and all of it confined within a very

3311.68 --> 3316.24
specific volume

3314.72 --> 3318.9599999999996
that's what i think

3316.24 --> 3321.359
that what my model for the realm is i of

3318.96 --> 3323.2
course can't like prove it within

3321.359 --> 3327.119
physics but

3323.2 --> 3328.16
it is definitely falsifiable

3327.119 --> 3331.119
yeah

3328.16 --> 3335.839
that doesn't mean it's false it means

3331.119 --> 3335.839
you can test whether it is true or not

3337.76 --> 3341.28
worked very hard on figuring out how to

3340.24 --> 3343.4399999999996
do that

3341.28 --> 3347.1600000000003
is a sphere a loop no a sphere is a

3343.44 --> 3347.16
geometric shape

3353.359 --> 3358.72
not talking about a shape of earth it

3356.0 --> 3361.04
would be flat it's flat

3358.72 --> 3363.04
rectangular

3361.04 --> 3364.72
the volumetric

3363.04 --> 3368.0
content

3364.72 --> 3369.7599999999998
and it has a looping factor or multiple

3368.0 --> 3371.76
looping factors

3369.76 --> 3373.599
but with a minimum of one

3371.76 --> 3374.559
is the west

3373.599 --> 3378.1600000000003
where

3374.559 --> 3380.96
the whole flat thing flat every way

3378.16 --> 3383.68
you know this way you end up on the

3380.96 --> 3386.799
other side of that same flat face and

3383.68 --> 3389.52
you just keep on going keep on going

3386.799 --> 3392.0
in the same volume

3389.52 --> 3395.839
moving past the same regions again and

3392.0 --> 3398.319
again eternally if you choose to move

3395.839 --> 3398.319
like that

3398.48 --> 3405.119
looping a looping rectangular confine

3402.72 --> 3407.2799999999997
like every show i have on here on

3405.119 --> 3410.079
youtube here

3407.28 --> 3412.2400000000002
the the thumbnail that's it

3410.079 --> 3414.88
that's the model

3412.24 --> 3416.24
my model is literally the thumbnail for

3414.88 --> 3419.839
my show

3416.24 --> 3419.839
i've had it for quite a while

3422.079 --> 3427.76
right and it's only a model i can't

3425.44 --> 3431.2000000000003
prove it in science because science

3427.76 --> 3433.119
doesn't deal with what is situations

3431.2 --> 3437.0789999999997
so it's just not even relevant to

3433.119 --> 3437.079
science at all

3450.079 --> 3454.799
no it's continual

3452.72 --> 3456.3999999999996
there's no portal

3454.799 --> 3459.52
there's no line

3456.4 --> 3462.079
it is continual

3459.52 --> 3464.24
the realm itself is

3462.079 --> 3467.52
the loophole

3464.24 --> 3471.2
the entire thing is like a wormhole

3467.52 --> 3471.2
the space interconnects you have

3472.96 --> 3479.799
just yeah i mean how many times do i

3475.2 --> 3479.799
have to demonstrate it come on

3484.31 --> 3487.619
[Music]

3489.52 --> 3492.16
it's just

3490.799 --> 3493.44
there's

3492.16 --> 3495.359
a space

3493.44 --> 3497.28
the space interconnects

3495.359 --> 3500.24
with itself

3497.28 --> 3504.0
right so it's one continual space

3500.24 --> 3506.4799999999996
a looping space or a wormhole if you

3504.0 --> 3509.2
want to use the that particular

3506.48 --> 3509.2
vernacular

3509.359 --> 3513.44
and it's just permanent there's no

3510.88 --> 3515.92
waiting line there's no special magic

3513.44 --> 3517.92
line you have to cross it's continual

3515.92 --> 3520.48
the entire thing

3517.92 --> 3522.48
is the loop

3520.48 --> 3524.799
you understand

3522.48 --> 3527.119
like a sphere yeah except it's not a

3524.799 --> 3528.16
sphere because a sphere is a geometry a

3527.119 --> 3531.119
loop

3528.16 --> 3533.44
is a spatial dynamic

3531.119 --> 3535.92
which isn't technically not even like a

3533.44 --> 3538.96
defined term really

3535.92 --> 3541.119
outside well in physics

3538.96 --> 3543.599
it is in science fiction but they use it

3541.119 --> 3545.839
within pseudo-romanian four space i

3543.599 --> 3547.92
literally exclude time from being a

3545.839 --> 3550.16
factor and that's why i just call it

3547.92 --> 3554.7200000000003
spatial dynamics

3550.16 --> 3558.839
the dynamics of the space that exists

3554.72 --> 3558.839
and mainly how it interconnects

3559.52 --> 3563.2
a loop

3560.799 --> 3565.28
a continuum

3563.2 --> 3568.72
looping continuum is

3565.28 --> 3568.7200000000003
a spatial dynamic

3569.119 --> 3573.28
that's what it is

3571.04 --> 3577.2
an effect that just happens with the

3573.28 --> 3577.2000000000003
available space it interconnects

3581.68 --> 3585.3999999999996
it's not like a sphere

3590.4 --> 3593.04
hey guys

3596.4 --> 3601.839
hey here we go again

3598.4 --> 3601.839
good to have you here back

3618.64 --> 3622.2799999999997
my model is a well-known projection of

3621.28 --> 3624.6400000000003
the glow oh

3622.28 --> 3628.6800000000003
[Music]

3624.64 --> 3628.68
i've got some glovers here

3629.2 --> 3633.04
sphere is continuous so house loop

3631.04 --> 3636.799
different because it's flat

3633.04 --> 3636.799
it's not a geometric shape

3637.04 --> 3642.5589999999997
earth is not a geometric shape it's a

3639.92 --> 3644.96
realm it's an available volume and what

3642.559 --> 3646.079
is inside of that volume

3644.96 --> 3648.799
earth

3646.079 --> 3651.799
water air

3648.799 --> 3651.799
life

3676.72 --> 3680.24
sun overhead no

3681.2 --> 3685.2799999999997
sun is not an object hovering over a

3684.4 --> 3688.2400000000002
disc

3685.28 --> 3688.2400000000002
hill to the chaff

3691.359 --> 3696.52
it was probably

3693.04 --> 3696.52
a sock account

3698.88 --> 3701.28
yep

3704.82 --> 3708.88
[Music]

3707.44 --> 3710.839
yeah

3708.88 --> 3712.4
why don't you take a look at my

3710.839 --> 3714.48
thumbnail

3712.4 --> 3717.839
my show

3714.48 --> 3721.68
do you see the sun

3717.839 --> 3724.16
hovering over that flat surface do you

3721.68 --> 3726.64
do you see it

3724.16 --> 3728.16
in my thumbnail

3726.64 --> 3732.24
no

3728.16 --> 3734.96
because it isn't it's not a object in

3732.24 --> 3738.0789999999997
euclidean space

3734.96 --> 3740.64
that is radiating off this light like a

3738.079 --> 3742.6400000000003
giant light bulb

3740.64 --> 3744.24
that's not what the sun is neither are

3742.64 --> 3747.2
any of the celestials they're all

3744.24 --> 3750.0789999999997
non-local holograms

3747.2 --> 3752.5589999999997
they only have apparent distances

3750.079 --> 3755.559
and you can only determine angular

3752.559 --> 3755.559
relations

3755.76 --> 3760.3190000000004
throughout

3757.2 --> 3763.2799999999997
the space over the flat realm and

3760.319 --> 3765.7599999999998
throughout the passage of time

3763.28 --> 3767.599
those are the two factors in which the

3765.76 --> 3770.2400000000002
angular positions

3767.599 --> 3773.119
of the celestial's altar

3770.24 --> 3775.5989999999997
but you can never reach them

3773.119 --> 3778.7200000000003
you can never touch them

3775.599 --> 3781.92
and you'll never see an angular size

3778.72 --> 3784.16
increase due to a literal approach of it

3781.92 --> 3786.4
as an object because it isn't it's a

3784.16 --> 3788.799
non-local hologram all of the celestial

3786.4 --> 3793.96
lights are non-local holograms including

3788.799 --> 3793.96
the moon and including the sun

3800.83 --> 3804.0
[Music]

3813.92 --> 3816.92
hmm

3827.2 --> 3832.0
like scooby-doo when they keep running

3829.68 --> 3836.16
past the same side table and vase that's

3832.0 --> 3838.72
hilarious orinoco bombo but yeah

3836.16 --> 3841.52
that's right

3838.72 --> 3844.16
it's looping is not that complicated it

3841.52 --> 3846.88
really isn't

3844.16 --> 3851.16
we we deal with it all the time and we

3846.88 --> 3851.1600000000003
just think of it as a joke

3852.24 --> 3855.799
just very typical

3875.28 --> 3884.55
hmm

3876.73 --> 3884.55
[Music]

3887.76 --> 3892.92
rectangular looping flat earth

3894.72 --> 3899.1189999999997
with

3895.76 --> 3901.76
non-local holographic celestials

3899.119 --> 3903.92
it's very specific and like

3901.76 --> 3906.4
that combination is the only way it

3903.92 --> 3906.4
could work

3906.48 --> 3911.92
it's the only way it can work oh and

3909.119 --> 3916.799
also flat top

3911.92 --> 3916.799
i'm fairly certain it has a flat top

3917.68 --> 3922.64
besides it having a flat top is the only

3921.119 --> 3925.2000000000003
way

3922.64 --> 3928.24
that there is even a remote possibility

3925.2 --> 3931.52
that there are other realm segments

3928.24 --> 3933.9199999999996
that might be locked off out of the loop

3931.52 --> 3937.28
for now

3933.92 --> 3938.96
which would be why we have these maps

3937.28 --> 3942.6400000000003
of regions that

3938.96 --> 3942.64
well don't seem to be there

3946.079 --> 3949.28
right now at least

3947.599 --> 3952.799
or maybe they still are and they're just

3949.28 --> 3952.799
being hidden from us i don't know

3955.039 --> 3961.599
but there cannot be a dome if there is a

3957.76 --> 3964.2400000000002
dome then there then really

3961.599 --> 3966.079
the amount of land available cannot be

3964.24 --> 3968.9599999999996
outside of that though so i don't think

3966.079 --> 3972.079
there is a dome i think that

3968.96 --> 3973.92
the firmament has been reified into a

3972.079 --> 3975.76
dome

3973.92 --> 3976.799
because of the realization of gas

3975.76 --> 3979.039
pressure

3976.799 --> 3980.48
originally i think that the ancient ones

3979.039 --> 3981.92
even figured that out

3980.48 --> 3983.92
[Music]

3981.92 --> 3986.16
and because it's a physical structure

3983.92 --> 3987.52
and because of the celestials that

3986.16 --> 3990.24
appeared to you

3987.52 --> 3992.079
in the form of like a dome

3990.24 --> 3994.16
and i think that it just like over

3992.079 --> 3996.799
connected it they made mention of it and

3994.16 --> 3999.0389999999998
then it was got over connected

3996.799 --> 3999.0389999999998
right

3999.92 --> 4005.76
i think the firmament really just

4001.839 --> 4009.2799999999997
indicates like the stars and so

4005.76 --> 4013.119
is not actually a physical object

4009.28 --> 4013.119
not within the physical realm at least

4016.16 --> 4020.72
right but that doesn't take away from

4018.72 --> 4022.72
the fact that there has to be a

4020.72 --> 4026.24
limitation to the amount of volume in

4022.72 --> 4026.24
order to have gas pressure

4026.88 --> 4030.1600000000003
but i think that

4028.72 --> 4032.72
the way that is

4030.16 --> 4036.96
achieved is through a flat top like a

4032.72 --> 4036.9599999999996
giant table it's just sitting there

4037.359 --> 4041.7599999999998
it may literally have

4039.839 --> 4044.4
not even half points where it touches

4041.76 --> 4046.7990000000004
down which is extremely surreal it's

4044.4 --> 4050.2400000000002
just this eternally looping flat top

4046.799 --> 4052.96
it's it's a table without feet it's just

4050.24 --> 4055.839
there it's just up there and because

4052.96 --> 4058.4
every part would loop

4055.839 --> 4060.96
it's just always up there it doesn't

4058.4 --> 4063.44
come down there's nothing to connect it

4060.96 --> 4066.079
it's just a top that's there

4063.44 --> 4067.76
which is freaking surreal

4066.079 --> 4070.0
to think about it but i think that

4067.76 --> 4073.559
that's actually the case that's what the

4070.0 --> 4073.559
condition is

4076.16 --> 4080.64
we find the touchdown point right maybe

4078.72 --> 4083.2799999999997
there is like

4080.64 --> 4085.2799999999997
pillars in the corner of earth

4083.28 --> 4089.119
something weird like that maybe there is

4085.28 --> 4090.4
like a spot like one single foot

4089.119 --> 4091.52
that makes it

4090.4 --> 4093.52
connect

4091.52 --> 4096.159
and like that foot is indestructible

4093.52 --> 4097.92
because it's basically like

4096.159 --> 4100.159
non-space

4097.92 --> 4100.96
like it's a connection of non-space it's

4100.159 --> 4104.159
a

4100.96 --> 4105.52
foot that is made of non-volume

4104.159 --> 4107.44
so

4105.52 --> 4109.279
like the top would be

4107.44 --> 4111.599999999999
like a super hard barrier that's not

4109.279 --> 4114.2390000000005
actually buried simply that there is no

4111.6 --> 4116.159000000001
volume beyond it so it would be

4114.239 --> 4119.199
effectively like a super hard barrier

4116.159 --> 4121.679
well maybe the connector pillar

4119.199 --> 4124.0
if there even is any would also be

4121.679 --> 4126.319
non-volume it would literally be not

4124.0 --> 4129.04
material but just

4126.319 --> 4132.319
indestructible non-space

4129.04 --> 4134.0
this is getting very surreal but yeah

4132.319 --> 4136.319
i've thought about that

4134.0 --> 4138.799
before so it's not new to me as a

4136.319 --> 4138.799
concept

4144.839 --> 4150.159
right and by the way non-space could

4147.839 --> 4152.5599999999995
never be

4150.159 --> 4154.719
like it is absolutely immovable that's

4152.56 --> 4157.679
the whole point of non-space it's not

4154.719 --> 4159.679
like i got a cube of non-space it's

4157.679 --> 4161.759
impenetrable like the ultimate

4159.679 --> 4163.679
indestructible cube

4161.759 --> 4167.759
but yeah you can move it around that

4163.679 --> 4170.4800000000005
makes no sense non-space is literally

4167.759 --> 4172.719
a part where there is no volume for

4170.48 --> 4175.44
matter to be in

4172.719 --> 4177.279
that's not going to be mobile it's not

4175.44 --> 4180.879999999999
going to be a portable piece of

4177.279 --> 4183.359
non-space that can move within

4180.88 --> 4183.359
space

4183.6 --> 4188.52
yeah this might be starting to sound a

4185.839 --> 4191.199
little bit like

4188.52 --> 4193.6
astrophysicist weirdo theoretical

4191.199 --> 4196.0
physicist type talk i don't mean to this

4193.6 --> 4198.719
i'm still trying to make it very much

4196.0 --> 4203.159
based on physical reality

4198.719 --> 4203.159
i'm just considering these things

4205.679 --> 4210.4800000000005
you are making up ideas to fit what you

4207.84 --> 4212.2390000000005
believe rather than go with the evidence

4210.48 --> 4216.959999999999
to what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

4212.239 --> 4219.28
about orinoco wombo what evidence

4216.96 --> 4221.76
am i not going with

4219.28 --> 4224.8
ari knuckle womble

4221.76 --> 4224.8
the [ __ ] is this

4227.36 --> 4230.88
yeah i'm going off on a tangent based on

4230.0 --> 4232.48
my

4230.88 --> 4235.12
on my model

4232.48 --> 4238.239
and the things that we might come across

4235.12 --> 4239.44
as we explore it

4238.239 --> 4243.36
how does that

4239.44 --> 4246.32
make me ignore evidence how just dude

4243.36 --> 4248.239
how [ __ ] dare you tell me that

4246.32 --> 4250.0
what evidence am i ignoring what

4248.239 --> 4252.48
evidence did i ever

4250.0 --> 4252.48
ignore

4253.04 --> 4257.04
you can't doesn't matter if you say that

4254.96 --> 4259.28
with respect

4257.04 --> 4261.84
you told me that i'm ignoring evidence

4259.28 --> 4261.84
what the hell

4262.4 --> 4267.199
it's just like steamy traveler two days

4264.64 --> 4269.04
ago telling me i was circular reasoning

4267.199 --> 4273.0
what the [ __ ] is this with these

4269.04 --> 4273.0
ridiculous accusations

4278.08 --> 4280.64
what

4279.36 --> 4283.759999999999
evidence

4280.64 --> 4283.76
am i ignoring

4283.84 --> 4287.64
aren't good womble

4301.17 --> 4304.319
[Music]

4311.76 --> 4318.360000000001
yeah i think i'm gonna just title the

4314.0 --> 4318.36
show this will be good

4336.48 --> 4341.199
that's certainly a proper science

4339.36 --> 4343.92
fiction title

4341.199 --> 4347.159
but hey i feel like it today so

4343.92 --> 4347.159
why not

4359.76 --> 4364.400000000001
okay matthew well maybe he was making a

4362.48 --> 4366.639999999999
joke but that would have been a terrible

4364.4 --> 4369.04
moment to do that

4366.64 --> 4370.56
like i'm very serious when i talk about

4369.04 --> 4371.76
these things

4370.56 --> 4373.280000000001
it's not the

4371.76 --> 4377.04
like

4373.28 --> 4378.4
i am not a comedian trying to bring you

4377.04 --> 4380.64
jokes

4378.4 --> 4383.36
about the future now this is literally

4380.64 --> 4385.76
me putting down a concept that is just

4383.36 --> 4389.12
ahead of its time it was ahead of its

4385.76 --> 4389.12
time 20 years ago

4392.4 --> 4396.159
when i had when i hadn't really

4394.159 --> 4399.199
consciously grabbed it all that much but

4396.159 --> 4401.759999999999
when i already noticed first traits of

4399.199 --> 4403.5199999999995
like wait

4401.76 --> 4405.360000000001
sun is holographic

4403.52 --> 4407.040000000001
there's something really weird about the

4405.36 --> 4410.5199999999995
celestial lights

4407.04 --> 4410.5199999999995
really odd

4414.08 --> 4418.88
not to be fair i didn't know a

4415.84 --> 4421.12
rectangular looping nature back then

4418.88 --> 4423.4400000000005
but on the other hand i did have visions

4421.12 --> 4425.12
about it i just didn't understand it

4423.44 --> 4427.5199999999995
when i had it

4425.12 --> 4428.5599999999995
so freaky when you have literal

4427.52 --> 4431.280000000001
knowledge

4428.56 --> 4434.56
available in your actions

4431.28 --> 4436.719
that you don't understand

4434.56 --> 4438.719
it's like yeah i'm arbitrary all this

4436.719 --> 4441.52
knowledge i can do all this stuff oh

4438.719 --> 4444.0
it's such a great oversight

4441.52 --> 4447.84
but literally i don't understand what it

4444.0 --> 4449.679
is even that i know i'm just using it

4447.84 --> 4452.64
and this is all dark world by the way

4449.679 --> 4455.1990000000005
it's not in the physical reality

4452.64 --> 4457.12
god it's so weird

4455.199 --> 4459.36
okay i'm not helping the weirdness

4457.12 --> 4460.5599999999995
factor in my show this way by bringing

4459.36 --> 4462.48
that up

4460.56 --> 4464.320000000001
but my point is is that

4462.48 --> 4464.69
this idea has been building for a long

4464.32 --> 4466.159
time

4464.69 --> 4467.28
[Music]

4466.159 --> 4468.48
and this is

4467.28 --> 4470.08
i genuinely

4468.48 --> 4472.32
think that this is what the physical

4470.08 --> 4477.239
reality is

4472.32 --> 4477.239
i really think it is that way

4487.84 --> 4493.76
the looping wormhole space

4490.4 --> 4495.92
and potential non-space

4493.76 --> 4497.1990000000005
right the whole point about the looping

4495.92 --> 4499.76
confine

4497.199 --> 4503.36
is to take away the physicality

4499.76 --> 4503.360000000001
assumption bias born

4503.44 --> 4508.879999999999
heavily rubbed in through literature

4506.32 --> 4511.44
idea that there is an infinite volume in

4508.88 --> 4513.76
any form

4511.44 --> 4516.879999999999
not even talking about the realm but

4513.76 --> 4519.52
even the domers the flutter domers they

4516.88 --> 4521.1990000000005
just can't help it but imagine what it's

4519.52 --> 4523.6
out shaded to do

4521.199 --> 4525.759999999999
it's just the same stupid space [ __ ]

4523.6 --> 4527.679
over and over again i think sometimes

4525.76 --> 4530.4800000000005
that they literally

4527.679 --> 4534.2390000000005
invented infinite space just to make

4530.48 --> 4536.08
people shut the [ __ ] up about what is

4534.239 --> 4540.879999999999
outstanding there

4536.08 --> 4544.0
wasn't no more no just [ __ ] off

4540.88 --> 4545.679
there is no infinite infinity there is

4544.0 --> 4548.88
no physical infinity there is no

4545.679 --> 4552.0
infinite volume it cannot be

4548.88 --> 4556.64
physically impossible logically

4552.0 --> 4556.64
impossible materially impossible

4560.88 --> 4565.04
infinity

4562.56 --> 4567.679
cannot be designed

4565.04 --> 4571.0
physically

4567.679 --> 4571.0
it's impossible

4571.52 --> 4575.76
but in people's mind they only always

4573.6 --> 4578.0
want to know what's more what is

4575.76 --> 4582.2390000000005
what is here in between this what what

4578.0 --> 4582.239
is beyond that thing oh

4582.4 --> 4587.12
right always keep on going so oh even

4585.12 --> 4589.92
with your flat earth and the dome the

4587.12 --> 4591.679
doom is like oh yeah guess what now

4589.92 --> 4594.4
you're going to be wondering

4591.679 --> 4598.08
what's outside of the door it never

4594.4 --> 4602.08
stops it never stops the whining

4598.08 --> 4605.84
what's outside what is outside yeah

4602.08 --> 4609.84
there is no outside there is no space

4605.84 --> 4609.84
outside of the realm

4610.48 --> 4616.4
it's literally not endless nothing it is

4614.719 --> 4618.0
just nothing

4616.4 --> 4620.4
nothing endless

4618.0 --> 4623.199
no nothing to be able to fill it up

4620.4 --> 4625.839999999999
there is no more space

4623.199 --> 4629.12
material cannot move there

4625.84 --> 4629.12
there is just nothing

4632.159 --> 4637.599999999999
it's not volume for you to be able to go

4634.56 --> 4641.1990000000005
into or escape into or to evacuate into

4637.6 --> 4645.360000000001
is just nothing no space nothing

4641.199 --> 4647.07
material cannot go there is just nothing

4645.36 --> 4650.219999999999

4654.56 --> 4660.6
not the infinite vacuum of space and oh

4658.64 --> 4663.76
look the hazard oh you could just

4660.6 --> 4666.400000000001
depressurize and freeze up and block no

4663.76 --> 4669.320000000001
there's just no volume there

4666.4 --> 4673.96
material cannot go there it's just

4669.32 --> 4673.96
inaccessible it's non-space

4694.08 --> 4698.08
yeah you've seen it yeah the original

4699.28 --> 4704.0
space shuttle stuff looked really

4700.88 --> 4705.679
[ __ ] but the cgi

4704.0 --> 4707.84
things that they've done with it also

4705.679 --> 4711.2390000000005
through hollywood did make it look a lot

4707.84 --> 4711.2390000000005
better though

4712.11 --> 4721.21
[Music]

4726.48 --> 4735.4
wow i see the chat has quickly moved on

4731.04 --> 4735.4
from the complicated and surreal

4744.719 --> 4748.4
yeah by the way i don't know if you

4746.4 --> 4750.32
realized even like what i'm talking

4748.4 --> 4754.4
about non-space

4750.32 --> 4754.4
that's actually a thing in my model

4754.64 --> 4760.64
and non-space is the exact diametric

4757.76 --> 4762.400000000001
opposite of a vacuum of space

4760.64 --> 4764.96
even thought about that it's the exact

4762.4 --> 4764.96
opposite

4766.159 --> 4772.639999999999
because a vacuum of space is

4768.96 --> 4775.52
well materially infinitely accessible it

4772.64 --> 4778.400000000001
just wants to be filled up right

4775.52 --> 4780.56
none space is literally 100 percent

4778.4 --> 4782.719
inaccessible for material so it's the

4780.56 --> 4784.8
exact opposite

4782.719 --> 4789.2390000000005
none in space

trademark arwin 2020.

4791.6 --> 4795.360000000001
and i mean it

4793.12 --> 4796.4
i mean that's

4795.36 --> 4798.5599999999995
even if

4796.4 --> 4800.719
none of you believe it it's still like a

4798.56 --> 4803.719
pretty revolutionary science fiction

4800.719 --> 4803.719
concept

4817.28 --> 4821.44
yeah pjc net but that you know there's

4819.12 --> 4824.159
an interaction between

4821.44 --> 4825.599999999999
hollywood movies and supposed space

4824.159 --> 4828.32
missions

4825.6 --> 4830.8
space missions just do stuff

4828.32 --> 4833.12
then hollywood movies tries to glory

4830.8 --> 4835.12
that's glorified that stuff

4833.12 --> 4837.84
making it more beautiful making it more

4835.12 --> 4840.32
exciting making it look more realistic

4837.84 --> 4842.2390000000005
to the mind's eye

4840.32 --> 4844.88
than this like the hollywood movies from

4842.239 --> 4847.199
that and then

4844.88 --> 4849.6
the space mission people

4847.199 --> 4850.719
look at the hollywood movies and see how

4849.6 --> 4853.6
can we

4850.719 --> 4855.28
adapt to that to basically perfect the

4853.6 --> 4857.679
thing that was inspired on what we

4855.28 --> 4861.04
originally did

4857.679 --> 4863.36
they should at least that only makes

4861.04 --> 4863.36
sense

4865.44 --> 4869.599999999999
but if there's no space how is phil b

4867.76 --> 4872.0
gonna squirt

4869.6 --> 4875.320000000001
well not in that no space i mean there's

4872.0 --> 4875.32
still space

4877.36 --> 4882.48
but in no in non-space there's just yeah

4880.88 --> 4885.88
there's nothing you can do there it's

4882.48 --> 4885.879999999999
just inaccessible

4895.04 --> 4898.96
oh you were literally talking about no

4897.12 --> 4900.719
space

4898.96 --> 4904.32
well there's always space in your mind

4900.719 --> 4904.32
you know what's that

4905.199 --> 4910.5199999999995
why are you dropping links in my chat

4926.239 --> 4929.799999999999
[ __ ] is the point

4931.04 --> 4934.32
high altitude balloon

4935.6 --> 4937.92
so

4939.12 --> 4942.4
does that prove anything

4942.88 --> 4947.4400000000005
wow is that

4944.48 --> 4949.12
like the sun

4947.44 --> 4950.638999999999
almost

4949.12 --> 4953.28
above it

4950.639 --> 4955.84
that still looks just like infinitely

4953.28 --> 4955.84
far away

4957.36 --> 4960.799999999999
but that is well aimed though

4962.239 --> 4968.759999999999
like they really got the balloon to rise

4964.4 --> 4968.759999999999
exactly underneath it

4972.0 --> 4975.76
that's actually not a bad video

4978.56 --> 4981.04
yeah

4979.44 --> 4983.199
you're still gonna get a timeout for

4981.04 --> 4983.199
that

4983.28 --> 4988.32
i'll just post a link

4985.6 --> 4990.2390000000005
you stop it

4988.32 --> 4992.719
because i still think like it's a very

4990.239 --> 4994.959999999999
short video yeah it might be posted by

4992.719 --> 4996.32
some ass hat

4994.96 --> 4997.92
i don't care

4996.32 --> 5001.84
it's pretty cool footage it's just a

4997.92 --> 5003.76
balloon footage where the video

5001.84 --> 5006.400000000001
pointing upwards shows that it was let

5003.76 --> 5008.2390000000005
up well exactly where the sun is

5006.4 --> 5010.799999999999
directly overhead so that is pretty

5008.239 --> 5010.799999999999
impressive

5011.52 --> 5016.56
it doesn't prove the freaking globe

5014.88 --> 5020.2390000000005
at all

5016.56 --> 5022.719
it actually kind of proves my concept

5020.239 --> 5027.879999999999
about the sun being non-local hologram

5022.719 --> 5027.88
because it doesn't seem close at all

5052.27 --> 5056.009
[Music]

5111.36 --> 5117.4
13 37 is what are you talking about you

5130.8 --> 5135.0
like what are you talking about

5147.12 --> 5152.719
yes professor phil well you go ahead

5150.239 --> 5154.5599999999995
you go and do that

5152.719 --> 5157.92
oh my god

5154.56 --> 5157.92
this never stops

5158.4 --> 5162.599999999999
i'm gonna take a breather

5266.48 --> 5270.678999999999
sequence all the time why

5300.639 --> 5305.43
you don't need an angle

5303.28 --> 5308.7699999999995
god

5305.43 --> 5308.77
[Music]

5308.88 --> 5311.4400000000005
of course

5312.08 --> 5317.92
i mean this is what happens when nathan

5314.0 --> 5320.159
just doesn't go live for one day

5317.92 --> 5321.679
well

5320.159 --> 5324.638999999999
they all just

5321.679 --> 5327.88
immediately fall back to as if nothing

5324.639 --> 5327.88
ever happened

5343.44 --> 5347.159
oh god

5351.84 --> 5357.28
nathan missed a day yeah there's no live

5354.32 --> 5357.28
show today akumu

5358.719 --> 5365.84
so of course you would all feel that out

5361.04 --> 5365.84
and immediately go maximum ballistic

5368.88 --> 5373.0
because that always happens

5384.08 --> 5388.88
hope he's good yeah i know it's good

5386.0 --> 5389.679
it's his daughter's birthday

5388.88 --> 5392.16
so

5389.679 --> 5395.29
there's nothing wrong

5392.16 --> 5395.29

5418.239 --> 5423.759999999999
ah guys i can't even really talk

5421.76 --> 5426.0
like i

5423.76 --> 5426.0
ah

5426.32 --> 5430.88
like this is not the [ __ ] i talk about i

5428.4 --> 5432.32
mean it's so straightforward in your

5430.88 --> 5435.84
face i just

5432.32 --> 5435.84
i can't deal with this anymore

5438.08 --> 5442.88
can i just talk about my looping

5439.92 --> 5445.28
wormholes and non-space again i mean

5442.88 --> 5448.96
that's interesting that's new

5445.28 --> 5452.08
it's not just the endless

5448.96 --> 5455.6
cultist gibberish repeating the same old

5452.08 --> 5458.159
[ __ ] over and over again

5455.6 --> 5460.159000000001
i mean there's no use to even address

5458.159 --> 5462.879999999999
that at this point

5460.159 --> 5466.08
just be glad that you get it

5462.88 --> 5466.08
they're not gonna get it

5468.89 --> 5472.159000000001
[Music]

5470.4 --> 5474.96
been buffering for five well that's

5472.159 --> 5478.239
usually i think it's just your computer

5474.96 --> 5480.32
or your internet connection enterprise

5478.239 --> 5482.48
because that's only you you've said that

5480.32 --> 5486.199
for quite a while that that happens it's

5482.48 --> 5486.199
really only you

5500.8 --> 5505.4400000000005
for the looping theory wouldn't there be

5502.719 --> 5508.08
some observable curvature no

5505.44 --> 5508.08
not at all

5511.6 --> 5516.8
no it's more like a

5514.4 --> 5519.12
looking into a tunnel of mirrors

5516.8 --> 5521.76
right to opposing mirrors you look into

5519.12 --> 5524.239
it you see yourself constantly

5521.76 --> 5526.320000000001
that's what it's like

5524.239 --> 5529.12
except

5526.32 --> 5532.48
everybody's in within that

5529.12 --> 5533.679
visual loop is not facing a post one to

5532.48 --> 5535.759999999999
one another

5533.679 --> 5537.52
they're all facing the exact same way

5535.76 --> 5540.4800000000005
that's what it would look like

5537.52 --> 5542.96
if you could like over bridge the entire

5540.48 --> 5547.799999999999
distance with your optics

5542.96 --> 5547.8
i don't think that's possible so

5562.0 --> 5567.199
only on this show weird price fathom i

5564.56 --> 5567.1990000000005
don't get it

5571.679 --> 5575.52
the looping makes more sense than it's

5573.44 --> 5577.36
going around yeah

5575.52 --> 5580.0
it does make sense

5577.36 --> 5583.36
and besides the circle

5580.0 --> 5584.639
disc is a reification

5583.36 --> 5587.12
the map

5584.639 --> 5589.84
is not to scale

5587.12 --> 5589.84
it doesn't fit

5591.36 --> 5595.839999999999
the outside parts of that projection are

5594.48 --> 5599.199
stretched

5595.84 --> 5601.84
and the inside parts of that projection

5599.199 --> 5604.799999999999
are cramped it doesn't fit it's it

5601.84 --> 5608.639
cannot be literally that

5604.8 --> 5611.360000000001
the disc shaped map is not a euclidean

5608.639 --> 5614.08
presentation of the of the terrain it's

5611.36 --> 5614.08
just a fact

5615.679 --> 5620.32
even though it's a very usable map right

5618.48 --> 5622.638999999999
not disagreeing with that

5620.32 --> 5625.84
reusable

5622.639 --> 5627.84
it's just not literal

5625.84 --> 5630.84
i don't even think it's disk oriented at

5627.84 --> 5630.84
all

5632.239 --> 5639.169999999999
i think it's rectangular

[Music]

5644.29 --> 5647.369
[Music]

5657.199 --> 5660.4
okay

5658.4 --> 5661.36
well since you're five minutes behind

5660.4 --> 5663.599999999999
adam

5661.36 --> 5665.92
i'm just gonna let you catch up with

5663.6 --> 5667.84
your very late questions

5665.92 --> 5671.719
on the video

5667.84 --> 5671.719
i do address it

5673.6 --> 5678.679
wait i addressed it like 15 minutes ago

5707.119 --> 5711.5199999999995
you don't know how lucky or the

5708.639 --> 5715.679
calculators exist no

5711.52 --> 5717.679
your dad was a fool phil your dad was a

5715.679 --> 5720.08
fool

5717.679 --> 5722.719
oh wait i mean you'd you actually said

5720.08 --> 5725.119
no your dad is a fool you'd

5722.719 --> 5726.96
because calculators have actually taken

5725.119 --> 5727.759999999999
away

5726.96 --> 5731.84
like

5727.76 --> 5731.84
calculation ability from people

5732.32 --> 5738.0
if you learn to deal with a calculator

5734.4 --> 5740.96
before you learn to get math the basics

5738.0 --> 5744.0
then you will never get it and without

5740.96 --> 5747.28
it you won't be able to do [ __ ]

5744.0 --> 5751.52
you'll be like oh where's my computer

5747.28 --> 5751.5199999999995
i can't calculate stupid [ __ ]

5752.48 --> 5758.5599999999995
i'm very glad that i grew up

5755.44 --> 5760.4
well kind of pre-computer age like that

5758.56 --> 5762.56
where not like

5760.4 --> 5764.638999999999
where it's just not everybody just gets

5762.56 --> 5766.56
standard calculator everywhere on your

5764.639 --> 5769.28
computer

5766.56 --> 5770.8
i thought that was great because i liked

5769.28 --> 5773.679
training

5770.8 --> 5777.28
basic math skills i like doing that and

5773.679 --> 5778.719
i'm still relatively good at it

5777.28 --> 5783.0
like i'm not

5778.719 --> 5783.0
totally dependent on calculators

5784.08 --> 5788.88
was making a terry games

5786.4 --> 5791.119
oh oh so if you make a terry games that

5788.88 --> 5794.159000000001
means you're not a fool

5791.119 --> 5794.159
excuse me yut

5795.76 --> 5801.679
are you saying that computer programmers

5799.28 --> 5804.0
because they're so good at that that

5801.679 --> 5806.08
they are stars and everything else in

5804.0 --> 5808.48
life's wisdom are they

5806.08 --> 5808.48
cute

5809.04 --> 5812.04
no

5816.88 --> 5820.639
now they just took their chance with the

5818.88 --> 5824.32
computer age

5820.639 --> 5826.96
but they did probably not envision

5824.32 --> 5829.599999999999
how freaking dumb people would become

5826.96 --> 5830.4800000000005
because of it

5829.6 --> 5834.08
yeah

5830.48 --> 5836.879999999999
computers have made us dumber

5834.08 --> 5838.719
because they do things for us now so

5836.88 --> 5841.119
easily

5838.719 --> 5842.8
we are not forced to do it with our own

5841.119 --> 5844.88
heads anymore

5842.8 --> 5848.08
that makes us stupid

5844.88 --> 5851.4400000000005
come lazy complacent it's so too easy to

5848.08 --> 5854.48
just make something else do it instantly

5851.44 --> 5857.678999999999
so if you don't train it you lose it

5854.48 --> 5857.678999999999
and you become dumb

5861.6 --> 5866.76
right i'm glad you agree on that then

5863.76 --> 5866.76
youtube

5874.159 --> 5877.92
is it still remembered trigonometric

5876.0 --> 5880.0
tables no

5877.92 --> 5882.56
no that's actually the part where i

5880.0 --> 5884.8
literally broke off with my interest in

5882.56 --> 5888.56
math i freaking hate

5884.8 --> 5890.719
sine cosine tangent i hate that [ __ ]

5888.56 --> 5894.320000000001
gives me a headache i like i just

5890.719 --> 5894.32
couldn't get that [ __ ] in

5894.4 --> 5899.199
it's like i don't want to understand

5896.0 --> 5899.199
it's just too annoying

5899.84 --> 5903.28
are you dumb now

5901.44 --> 5905.678999999999
well

5903.28 --> 5908.159
if you're gonna ask that question

5905.679 --> 5910.0
then i'd say yes

5908.159 --> 5912.239
because that's a pretty dumb question to

5910.0 --> 5912.239
ask

5919.119 --> 5923.48
hey yeah though good to see you

5949.76 --> 5952.76
hmm

5958.0 --> 5964.48
always seem to do what nathan does

5961.36 --> 5966.799999999999
well you don't really seem to be paying

5964.48 --> 5970.159
too much attention then because i

5966.8 --> 5971.1990000000005
absolutely don't always do what nathan

5970.159 --> 5973.36
does

5971.199 --> 5977.759999999999
quite to the contrary

5973.36 --> 5977.759999999999
i'm kind of the guy that tends to like

5977.84 --> 5982.88
get in the opposition

5980.8 --> 5987.04
make things naughty

5982.88 --> 5987.04
get weird and like

5987.84 --> 5996.0
try to get in odd concept no it's like

5992.56 --> 5998.0
like nathan and me are nothing alike

5996.0 --> 6000.4
we're completely different in our

5998.0 --> 6002.88
approach in our styles and even like

6000.4 --> 6005.199
social positions how we react

6002.88 --> 6007.28
in social situations we're totally

6005.199 --> 6010.08
different

6007.28 --> 6012.88
face group that is pondering upon

6010.08 --> 6015.84
if we're fancying because we're so much

6012.88 --> 6017.4400000000005
alike is just [ __ ] wrong and [ __ ]

6015.84 --> 6021.159000000001
because we're not

6017.44 --> 6021.159
it's a false premise

6038.239 --> 6041.04
right

6039.119 --> 6044.5599999999995
i introduced bowen

6041.04 --> 6045.36
did nathan introduce baldwin

6044.56 --> 6048.8
no

6045.36 --> 6051.599999999999
he was [ __ ] annoyed by it

6048.8 --> 6053.84
even thought that i went rogue at times

6051.6 --> 6055.679
he sometimes attacks me for being

6053.84 --> 6057.52
ballwin when i'm not even acting like

6055.679 --> 6060.0
balwin because he's just kind of

6057.52 --> 6062.719
paranoid that i'm doing it again

6060.0 --> 6064.56
yeah that's how much nathan and me are

6062.719 --> 6067.76
alike

6064.56 --> 6070.76
not alike

6067.76 --> 6070.76
stupid

6085.04 --> 6087.36
okay

6090.719 --> 6093.719
hello

6108.719 --> 6113.04
anything to change the focus from

6110.239 --> 6115.759999999999
cognitive painful conclusion right

6113.04 --> 6118.239
but the pain just makes them start to

6115.76 --> 6119.92
think about porn official nomad that's

6118.239 --> 6121.599999999999
how it works that's how gamma squirt

6119.92 --> 6123.04
boys work

6121.6 --> 6125.280000000001
they get pain

6123.04 --> 6126.639
from the content from the ideas from the

6125.28 --> 6130.239
conclusions

6126.639 --> 6132.0
and then they have to go square

6130.239 --> 6133.5199999999995
but

6132.0 --> 6134.639
so yeah

6133.52 --> 6136.96
i guess

6134.639 --> 6138.719
that they're then just gonna take the

6136.96 --> 6141.28
ones that are the cause of the pain and

6138.719 --> 6143.36
just start to fantasize about porn with

6141.28 --> 6144.96
them that's how they deal with their

6143.36 --> 6146.88
problems

6144.96 --> 6148.639
i'm really wondering like what it would

6146.88 --> 6151.52
have been like with them in school did

6148.639 --> 6153.92
they do that with the teachers too

6151.52 --> 6156.2390000000005
that were kind of strict and not buying

6153.92 --> 6158.4800000000005
their [ __ ] attitudes are they

6156.239 --> 6161.04
secretly like

6158.48 --> 6163.5199999999995
masturbating on

6161.04 --> 6166.159
their teachers too like god these people

6163.52 --> 6169.52
are so gross

6166.159 --> 6169.5199999999995
so gross

6171.69 --> 6176.96
[Music]

6174.88 --> 6179.36
nathan is locking himself into his

6176.96 --> 6182.4800000000005
housekeeping

6179.36 --> 6185.5199999999995
pass-through date no no no yeah though

6182.48 --> 6187.678999999999
i disagree it's gonna keep going

6185.52 --> 6188.84
until the end

6187.679 --> 6191.4400000000005
of the

6188.84 --> 6193.119000000001
internet no the housekeeping is never

6191.44 --> 6195.5199999999995
getting old just like

6193.119 --> 6197.759999999999
housekeeping

6195.52 --> 6200.080000000001
never stops

6197.76 --> 6202.8
like it should never stop because if you

6200.08 --> 6205.92
stop housekeeping in like a hotel or a

6202.8 --> 6207.04
house it becomes a piece of [ __ ]

6205.92 --> 6209.119
you see

6207.04 --> 6210.8
it's why you can't stop housekeeping you

6209.119 --> 6213.199
have to keep going

6210.8 --> 6215.52
that's the point

6213.199 --> 6217.04
and it's never getting old it's not past

6215.52 --> 6219.92
due date it's

6217.04 --> 6222.48
very fresh very relevant very painful

6219.92 --> 6224.88
for globe religion

6222.48 --> 6227.599999999999
i mean yeah okay it might get a little

6224.88 --> 6229.679
annoying for us guys that are already

6227.6 --> 6231.92
getting it right

6229.679 --> 6233.36
i mean we don't all just want to become

6231.92 --> 6237.92
housekeeping

6233.36 --> 6240.0
housekeeping like yeah that's annoying

6237.92 --> 6241.76
not everybody wants to do that all the

6240.0 --> 6244.4
time but it is very important that it

6241.76 --> 6244.400000000001
keeps going

6244.8 --> 6250.2390000000005
one shawn no no but it don't get though

6247.679 --> 6251.92
the point is that it's every day

6250.239 --> 6255.5199999999995
it's so imp

6251.92 --> 6257.76
look if you don't like it i get it

6255.52 --> 6259.52
if you're getting sick of it and you're

6257.76 --> 6261.76
like ugh i don't want to hear about it

6259.52 --> 6263.679
for a while just just stick to the flat

6261.76 --> 6265.6
earth early bird show and i'm just not

6263.679 --> 6268.96
gonna go to the flat earth debates for

6265.6 --> 6272.04
like a week or two a week i get it

6268.96 --> 6274.8
it's not gonna stop it's critical

6272.04 --> 6278.8
housekeeping questions where the best

6274.8 --> 6281.04
thing that ever happened to fed

6278.8 --> 6283.360000000001
is the winning formula and it's gonna

6281.04 --> 6286.32
keep going

6283.36 --> 6288.4
and it might even have new elements

6286.32 --> 6290.159
still that are gonna pop up and add on

6288.4 --> 6293.28
to it i mean

6290.159 --> 6294.96
it's not been this this stale

6293.28 --> 6296.96
same kind of thing

6294.96 --> 6299.52
for years now

6296.96 --> 6301.76
new things are figured out and

6299.52 --> 6303.52
added on

6301.76 --> 6306.08
all the housekeeping questions get

6303.52 --> 6306.080000000001
refined

6311.119 --> 6317.4
best shows are where he lets adlib

6314.4 --> 6317.4
sure

6321.04 --> 6327.44
i'm just saying it's not going to stop

6324.32 --> 6329.679
and there's no point in wanting that

6327.44 --> 6332.638999999999
if you're getting sick of it just go do

6329.679 --> 6335.679
something else for a while

6332.639 --> 6335.679
it's not gonna stop

6337.119 --> 6341.199
seeing people answered the same question

6338.88 --> 6342.96
show off the show yeah we play around

6341.199 --> 6345.839999999999
with it i play around with it all the

6342.96 --> 6345.84
time

6356.0 --> 6362.0
i mean i'm not super interested in the

6358.4 --> 6365.5199999999995
housekeeping questions every single show

6362.0 --> 6366.719
right i don't always pike up

6365.52 --> 6370.56
i get it

6366.719 --> 6374.96
but it's not gonna go away though

6370.56 --> 6374.96
it really it's really not it's important

6376.639 --> 6381.6
viewers does it get on his youtube live

6378.96 --> 6385.04
streams uh depends

6381.6 --> 6387.52
is usually around like uh

6385.04 --> 6390.48
between 15 and 100

6387.52 --> 6390.4800000000005
sometimes more

6393.84 --> 6399.88
but yeah nathan does get a reasonable

6396.159 --> 6399.879999999999
amount of live viewers

6402.0 --> 6406.88
by the way 37 watching right now

6404.719 --> 6410.36
thanks

6406.88 --> 6410.36
share the show

6414.8 --> 6420.639
and ask a question

6417.92 --> 6424.2390000000005
especially if it's about looping worm

6420.639 --> 6426.96
all space and non-space because if you

6424.239 --> 6428.48
just oh of course non-space yeah sure we

6426.96 --> 6430.4
know what that is right

6428.48 --> 6432.32
means it's just a general concept it's

6430.4 --> 6435.199
like everywhere you could just google it

6432.32 --> 6436.799999999999
and yeah non-space of course right

6435.199 --> 6438.239
no no

6436.8 --> 6441.1990000000005
no that's new

6438.239 --> 6444.08
it doesn't actually exist before

6441.199 --> 6446.4
today this is the first day ever that

6444.08 --> 6450.5599999999995
i've called it non-space

6446.4 --> 6452.638999999999
i was finally able to figure out a name

6450.56 --> 6456.080000000001
i named it now

6452.639 --> 6458.400000000001
i mean the effect existed in my head now

6456.08 --> 6460.239
it's got a name non-space

6458.4 --> 6464.44
if you have any questions about that i

6460.239 --> 6464.44
will be happy to answer them

6478.32 --> 6485.599999999999
oh my god bill bell

6481.679 --> 6487.76
stop being a dumb ass

6485.6 --> 6490.2390000000005
breaking housekeeping questions don't

6487.76 --> 6492.320000000001
apply to the flat earth because there is

6490.239 --> 6493.599999999999
no

6492.32 --> 6495.759999999999
claim

6493.6 --> 6498.76
that matches those housekeeping

6495.76 --> 6498.76
questions

6500.48 --> 6502.799999999999
right

6503.119 --> 6507.36
yeah you could try to have a couple of

6505.28 --> 6508.5599999999995
housekeeping questions for the flat

6507.36 --> 6511.28
earth

6508.56 --> 6513.280000000001
and then we'd answer it we've won

6511.28 --> 6515.199
professor phil bell it's over the

6513.28 --> 6517.199
housekeeping questions

6515.199 --> 6521.119
is basically just

6517.199 --> 6523.839999999999
monument cleaning duty because we've won

6521.119 --> 6525.199
there's no more battles to be done

6523.84 --> 6527.52
you can't

6525.199 --> 6529.199
say oh we're just going to do that with

6527.52 --> 6531.119000000001
the flat earth now we're just going to

6529.199 --> 6533.04
have housekeeping question for the

6531.119 --> 6535.119
flatter yeah it's not going to work

6533.04 --> 6536.96
you're going to be defeated every single

6535.119 --> 6538.839999999999
time you're going to have to actually

6536.96 --> 6541.6
mute us

6538.84 --> 6544.0
lie lie with the straight face to

6541.6 --> 6546.639
everybody every time you do that

6544.0 --> 6549.04
you're gonna have to keep doing that

6546.639 --> 6553.1990000000005
because the housekeeping questions that

6549.04 --> 6555.199
we ask the globers about the globe earth

6553.199 --> 6556.719
they don't apply to the flat earth

6555.199 --> 6559.04
because the flat earth has

6556.719 --> 6561.599
does not have those claims

6559.04 --> 6563.92
there's barely any claims for the flat

6561.599 --> 6567.119000000001
earth or flat earth models

6563.92 --> 6568.4
and besides there are a couple of silly

6567.119 --> 6571.759999999999
claims

6568.4 --> 6573.5199999999995
tied into typical flat earth disc model

6571.76 --> 6575.360000000001
with a dome

6573.52 --> 6576.96
as i said silly

6575.36 --> 6578.159
and reified

6576.96 --> 6581.04
and

6578.159 --> 6583.679
why would anybody defend that

6581.04 --> 6587.119
because it makes no sense and you can

6583.679 --> 6588.8
constantly try to uphold that thing

6587.119 --> 6591.04
that a lot of people still believe out

6588.8 --> 6593.1990000000005
there

6591.04 --> 6595.84
and then drag in the silly assertions

6593.199 --> 6597.598999999999
about that but what's the point what's

6595.84 --> 6599.679
the point for us

6597.599 --> 6602.32
it's the point for me for nathan oakley

6599.679 --> 6604.159
and crew like why

6602.32 --> 6606.88
like we don't make that claim we know

6604.159 --> 6607.92
it's stupid

6606.88 --> 6610.2390000000005
yeah

6607.92 --> 6612.32
now the housekeeping questions that we

6610.239 --> 6615.36
ask for the globe however

6612.32 --> 6618.48
are not stupid because those are very

6615.36 --> 6620.32
relevant and are still based on claims

6618.48 --> 6623.04
of the globe earth

6620.32 --> 6625.28
that were made over half a century ago

6623.04 --> 6626.8
and that's still standing that are still

6625.28 --> 6630.159
being

6626.8 --> 6633.1990000000005
foretold by globe priests on television

6630.159 --> 6635.679
and the internet to this day

6633.199 --> 6637.44
so you can't say oh but we have the same

6635.679 --> 6639.119
thing we don't make those claims yes you

6637.44 --> 6640.638999999999
do

6639.119 --> 6642.96
and if you don't you're an anti-flat

6640.639 --> 6646.0
earther and a heretic

6642.96 --> 6646.0
to your own religion

6648.96 --> 6653.92
now start working on a useful model that

6651.44 --> 6656.239
teach us at the universe fine well i

6653.92 --> 6659.52
already got one professor phil i'm

6656.239 --> 6659.5199999999995
talking about it today

6660.4 --> 6664.96
all right hey if anybody wants to work

6662.639 --> 6667.92
that out dude i could use a couple of

6664.96 --> 6670.4800000000005
mathematicians and cartographers

6667.92 --> 6672.159
physicists with open minds that aren't

6670.48 --> 6673.919999999999
going to be globe condition and

6672.159 --> 6676.48
squirting every time i bring up

6673.92 --> 6678.639
something like looping

6676.48 --> 6681.598999999999
hey if they want to work it out with me

6678.639 --> 6684.2390000000005
then i could finalize a model i could do

6681.599 --> 6684.2390000000005
that yeah

6685.44 --> 6692.839999999999
i've got enough details together

6689.679 --> 6696.56
in my head at least on how to do

6692.84 --> 6698.25
it i think my model conceptions are very

6696.56 --> 6700.400000000001
viable

6698.25 --> 6703.44
[Music]

6700.4 --> 6706.638999999999
so yeah i could do that but

6703.44 --> 6709.839999999999
who's gonna pay for that

6706.639 --> 6709.84
i'm not

6713.199 --> 6718.36
nathan is on yeah it's not a live show

6725.22 --> 6729.319
[Music]

6736.159 --> 6740.239
you could do the mathematic that's cute

6740.719 --> 6744.599
i'll keep that in mind

6753.33 --> 6758.619
[Music]

6760.96 --> 6767.119
any comments on the balloon video youth

6764.32 --> 6770.32
i already answered that myself why don't

6767.119 --> 6775.0
you leave youth alone

6770.32 --> 6775.0
stop harassing people in my chat

6781.09 --> 6784.34
[Music]

6802.88 --> 6806.96
all right why not

6804.4 --> 6809.5599999999995
why not ask does anybody else support

6806.96 --> 6812.639
the concept of looping as being a vile

6809.56 --> 6817.320000000001
possibility possibility

6812.639 --> 6817.32
for the reality of this realm

6821.52 --> 6827.040000000001
hey at least you could see you

6824.719 --> 6829.599
so yeah you don't i'm not going to be

6827.04 --> 6831.04
pissed off if you don't think so

6829.599 --> 6833.679
but why not

6831.04 --> 6835.599
why not yeah

6833.679 --> 6837.76
so

6835.599 --> 6839.92
if you think it's a viable potential

6837.76 --> 6841.280000000001
possibility

6839.92 --> 6843.599
press one

6841.28 --> 6846.48
if you really think it's absolutely out

6843.599 --> 6847.84
of the order and like it there's no way

6846.48 --> 6850.239
it could be true

6847.84 --> 6850.2390000000005
zero

6853.599 --> 6857.28
and if you're a stock account that just

6855.36 --> 6860.839999999999
gonna pike in just to do that that means

6857.28 --> 6860.84
you're gonna be deleted

6865.52 --> 6869.52
oh wow you think so professor phil okay

6867.92 --> 6871.04
that's cool

6869.52 --> 6873.4400000000005
that's very interesting that you

6871.04 --> 6876.4
actually entertain that concept

6873.44 --> 6880.879999999999
didn't know you had it in yet

6876.4 --> 6880.879999999999
it's really tough it's mind-bending so

6885.28 --> 6888.28
hmm

6890.239 --> 6895.119
you need the height of the sun no you

6892.32 --> 6897.28
don't there is no height of the sun

6895.119 --> 6900.48
it's a non-local hologram

6897.28 --> 6903.04
right we're talking about my model right

6900.48 --> 6905.839999999999
there is no location for the sun in my

6903.04 --> 6905.84
model

6906.8 --> 6913.0
it's just the holographic map of angular

6909.119 --> 6913.0
appearance that's all

6921.119 --> 6924.88
hmm interesting okay well it seems like

6923.84 --> 6928.52
it

6924.88 --> 6928.52
evenly divided

6933.199 --> 6937.119
and by the way akuma virus i find that

6935.36 --> 6938.5599999999995
very sensible that you

6937.119 --> 6940.48
say one

6938.56 --> 6942.4800000000005
specifically because you say you don't

6940.48 --> 6943.839999999999
fully understand that that is very

6942.48 --> 6946.0
honest of you

6943.84 --> 6947.599
and a sensible position you shouldn't

6946.0 --> 6950.32
exclude something if you don't

6947.599 --> 6954.639
completely if you don't understand it

6950.32 --> 6954.639
that's that's actually kind of wise

6955.92 --> 6959.599
yeah

6957.52 --> 6961.84
yeah new people

6959.599 --> 6961.84
don't

6962.639 --> 6966.159000000001
as i said this is not the time to pike

6965.199 --> 6969.159
up

6966.159 --> 6969.159
huh

6989.84 --> 6993.4400000000005
all right well that was interesting

6997.95 --> 7002.8
[Music]

6999.76 --> 7006.1990000000005
actually expected less so that's kind of

7002.8 --> 7006.1990000000005
a happy surprise

7007.04 --> 7010.31
[Music]

7016.02 --> 7022.029
[Music]

7035.599 --> 7040.719
yeah pgc net that's correct that was the

7038.32 --> 7040.719
question

7041.92 --> 7047.76
do i mean like the game asteroids well

7045.04 --> 7050.639
there's many video games especially the

7047.76 --> 7053.360000000001
older ones that have looping screams

7050.639 --> 7055.52
screens right

7053.36 --> 7057.598999999999
i mean what video game didn't have some

7055.52 --> 7059.599
looping screen effect

7057.599 --> 7061.04
right whether it is focused on the ship

7059.599 --> 7062.32
and like

7061.04 --> 7065.5199999999995
it

7062.32 --> 7067.679
because a lot of games had like

7065.52 --> 7069.76
like a bar of looping space and it would

7067.679 --> 7072.08
follow the ship around

7069.76 --> 7074.0
like space invaders had that where you

7072.08 --> 7076.08
would fly around you would move over the

7074.0 --> 7078.0
screen but the screen would then loop

7076.08 --> 7079.92
back in the same room

7078.0 --> 7081.76
right but you have that or whether you

7079.92 --> 7084.4
have the pac-man where the screen is

7081.76 --> 7087.04
still and you literally move over it and

7084.4 --> 7089.839999999999
then from one side to the other

7087.04 --> 7092.4
right either way looping it's happened

7089.84 --> 7092.400000000001
many times

7097.36 --> 7102.4
why delete votes because you're a piece

7099.199 --> 7105.44
of [ __ ] troll that needs to [ __ ] off

7102.4 --> 7108.4
i specifically said don't pike up with

7105.44 --> 7111.04
your stupid little sock account to add

7108.4 --> 7112.96
to the vote you hear me [ __ ] face i'll

7111.04 --> 7117.719
piss off

7112.96 --> 7117.719
i wasn't asking you troll [ __ ]

7139.52 --> 7143.320000000001
get contained indeed

7147.84 --> 7152.119000000001
and thanks for the modding by the way

7161.36 --> 7166.96
yeah george sandra i don't know why they

7163.119 --> 7166.96
do it it's ridiculous to me

7167.76 --> 7171.52
what happens with the looping model at

7169.599 --> 7174.88
the corners

7171.52 --> 7174.88
there aren't any corners

7175.44 --> 7180.638999999999
it's a continual tunnel

7178.56 --> 7182.56
there's no corners there's no actual

7180.639 --> 7186.639
border

7182.56 --> 7186.639
it's continual it's looping

7187.679 --> 7193.679
yeah it's not a box oh and the box just

7191.599 --> 7195.76
happens to connect there and there's a

7193.679 --> 7197.84
little hole from one side to the other

7195.76 --> 7200.320000000001
or you'll walk through it and like oh

7197.84 --> 7203.360000000001
i'm on the other side now no it's

7200.32 --> 7205.28
continual it just keeps on going and

7203.36 --> 7207.679
going and going and going within the

7205.28 --> 7209.84
same space

7207.679 --> 7214.639
continue there's no line there's no

7209.84 --> 7214.639
border there's no corner it's continual

7215.02 --> 7218.069
[Music]

7224.159 --> 7228.96
and i don't know if the loop is north to

7226.8 --> 7231.119000000001
south as well

7228.96 --> 7233.44
if it were then there might be more

7231.119 --> 7236.08
regions that are actually sitting in

7233.44 --> 7239.28
between

7236.08 --> 7241.5199999999995
beyond the north beyond the south before

7239.28 --> 7244.4
we can actually come back on the other

7241.52 --> 7246.080000000001
side if that is even possible right

7244.4 --> 7247.839999999999
because i don't know

7246.08 --> 7249.5199999999995
if the loop is

7247.84 --> 7250.400000000001
to all sides

7249.52 --> 7252.639
i

7250.4 --> 7254.96
i know if there is a loop that it has to

7252.639 --> 7258.639
be east to west absolutely

7254.96 --> 7260.4
but north to south is not necessarily

7258.639 --> 7262.88
a critical

7260.4 --> 7266.48
factor it doesn't have to be like that

7262.88 --> 7269.76
it could be that there is a barrier

7266.48 --> 7271.678999999999
like just this wall

7269.76 --> 7274.719
so that it would be more like a tunnel

7271.679 --> 7276.159
but i don't know if there is like a

7274.719 --> 7279.119
barrier

7276.159 --> 7282.32
it could be that indeed it also loops

7279.119 --> 7285.92
from north to south

7282.32 --> 7288.32
i don't know if it does but it could

7285.92 --> 7291.28
but there's any anyhow you twist it

7288.32 --> 7291.28
there's no corners

7292.159 --> 7297.04
get it a looping space

7294.56 --> 7300.4800000000005
does not have corners

7297.04 --> 7304.08
this specifically does not

7300.48 --> 7304.08
otherwise there is no loop

7307.36 --> 7315.44
sounds fourth dimensional what no

7311.679 --> 7315.4400000000005
no it is three dimensional

7315.52 --> 7321.040000000001
looping is three dimensional it is

7318.639 --> 7324.32
within 3d space

7321.04 --> 7326.639
it's a spatial dynamic setup that's what

7324.32 --> 7329.84
it is

that's all

quantum entanglement

7356.96 --> 7363.52
yeah but elise g quantum entanglement

7360.88 --> 7367.599
is kind of a numpty [ __ ] story that

7363.52 --> 7370.400000000001
makes absolutely no sense whatsoever

7367.599 --> 7373.96
it's a hokey quantum

7370.4 --> 7376.879999999999
mechanic sci-fi story based on false

7373.96 --> 7379.52
presuppositions if you know what i mean

7376.88 --> 7380.4800000000005
it's derived from the ridiculous notion

7379.52 --> 7382.8
that

7380.48 --> 7384.879999999999
two particles could be at the same place

7382.8 --> 7387.28
or at different places at the same time

7384.88 --> 7390.2390000000005
one one particle two different spots

7387.28 --> 7392.719
it's all quantum [ __ ] talk

7390.239 --> 7394.159
like that has to be a false premise

7392.719 --> 7396.8
because that's not possible it's

7394.159 --> 7400.08
illogical

7396.8 --> 7403.21
physical reality cannot

7400.08 --> 7404.719
be in contradiction to logic

7403.21 --> 7406.56
[Music]

7404.719 --> 7409.84
because it is

7406.56 --> 7412.159000000001
designed upon those rules

7409.84 --> 7414.08
it just it's a nonsense story it's a

7412.159 --> 7415.679
make believe oh two things at the same

7414.08 --> 7418.08
time why

7415.679 --> 7420.0
is it because you're assuming that light

7418.08 --> 7422.0
is a particle and then certainly in some

7420.0 --> 7423.76
kind of a test it just seems like wow

7422.0 --> 7426.239
but it's in

7423.76 --> 7428.719
can we conclude that the light particle

7426.239 --> 7430.879999999999
is in two places at the same time

7428.719 --> 7433.44
yes with the presupposition that light

7430.88 --> 7435.599
is a particle you can conclude based on

7433.44 --> 7436.879999999999
this test that it is in two spots at the

7435.599 --> 7439.04
same time

7436.88 --> 7441.92
or the entire premise is just wrong and

7439.04 --> 7444.719
it isn't a particle and it isn't a wave

7441.92 --> 7447.119
it's just infinitely divisible beams

7444.719 --> 7450.4
and that whatever you do with it

7447.119 --> 7453.5199999999995
yeah it can definitely seem to be at two

7450.4 --> 7455.679
different spots at the same time

7453.52 --> 7458.96
because it's infinitely divisible and

7455.679 --> 7460.32
not a finite sized particle that

7458.96 --> 7462.88
how could it be

7460.32 --> 7465.599
how could be a minimum size thing be it

7462.88 --> 7469.28
two spots at the same time yeah it can't

7465.599 --> 7471.599
because it isn't a minimum size thing

incorrect and everybody's all squirting

over it like they broke reality or

something like oh we just tamed reality

we can make things happen that are in

we have mastered the universe no you

were just wrong and everybody's going

with it and they're stupid and they

7538.88 --> 7542.4800000000005
it

7540.639 --> 7546.88
because it's everywhere

it's the new hot thing quantum [ __ ]

it's quantum now then it's super science

right because nobody understands it yeah

yeah that makes it very very special

doesn't it nobody understands it

7558.48 --> 7565.678999999999
well then you could seem extremely smart

7561.44 --> 7566.5599999999995
not just science smart but quantum smart

7565.679 --> 7568.56
oh

7566.56 --> 7570.079000000001
makes you even seem smarter even though

you don't understand what the [ __ ]

do i really have to read that professor

7608.32 --> 7612.0
phil

7609.599 --> 7614.0
really

7612.0 --> 7618.079
it could be

7614.0 --> 7619.119
the sun is affected by some magnetic

7618.079 --> 7621.04
force

7619.119 --> 7625.28
under the earth

7621.04 --> 7626.239
so it appears on the other side

7625.28 --> 7629.84
at the

7626.239 --> 7632.4
speed of light what speed of light

7629.84 --> 7635.04
there is no speed of light

7632.4 --> 7637.839999999999
it's a fictional concept

7635.04 --> 7640.32
it's freaking calculated arbitrarily

7637.84 --> 7641.76
chosen it's [ __ ] there is no speed

7640.32 --> 7643.119
of light there's no measured speed of

7641.76 --> 7645.119000000001
light

7643.119 --> 7648.32
and besides if you're going to involve

7645.119 --> 7650.4
magnetic forces does that mean

7648.32 --> 7652.88
you're going to reify the sun as a

7650.4 --> 7655.5199999999995
physical object

7652.88 --> 7658.0
like being put on a magnetic rail that's

really cute that's like rob skiba level

model which for the time being was

7660.32 --> 7665.28
pretty impressive

7662.56 --> 7667.52
is wrong though because the sun is not

7665.28 --> 7671.5199999999995
an object in a position it's a

7667.52 --> 7672.8
holographic phenomena

7671.52 --> 7676.159000000001
it just

7672.8 --> 7679.119000000001
appears it's visual there is no

7676.159 --> 7681.759999999999
object being magnetically held in a

7679.119 --> 7681.759999999999

7683.76 --> 7687.280000000001
now you're working on looping for me

7685.679 --> 7690.639
well there's no need

7687.28 --> 7692.96
you don't need to frame any

7690.639 --> 7695.36
physical based mechanism

7692.96 --> 7697.28
like that in order to

7695.36 --> 7700.4
propel or

7697.28 --> 7702.32
make the celestial lights

7700.4 --> 7704.32
move in their trajectories because

7702.32 --> 7706.48
they're not physical you don't need

7704.32 --> 7709.759999999999
anything to put them in their place

7706.48 --> 7713.919999999999
somehow because they're not objects

7709.76 --> 7713.92
they're holographic phenomena

7714.0 --> 7720.96
non-local they don't have a location

7716.32 --> 7720.96
it's just something that appears to us

i don't know how

7723.119 --> 7727.119
but it doesn't mean that because i don't

7724.96 --> 7729.76
know how i'm then going to reified into

7727.119 --> 7730.719
physical objects just so i can work on

at least

very close

i always keep forgetting the name

i'll

7764.48 --> 7766.959999999999
find it

i always forget

7772.639 --> 7776.719
what it's called

7773.92 --> 7780.679
but it's out there

7776.719 --> 7780.679
anyway i'll present that

7794.48 --> 7798.199
and that's this one

7799.16 --> 7803.199
[Music]

7801.199 --> 7806.239
i think this from all the projections

7803.199 --> 7807.598999999999
this is probably the most euclidium of

7806.239 --> 7810.159
them all

7807.599 --> 7813.719
but it's still not exactly the scale it

that's what it's called

7849.199 --> 7854.079
within the wiki that's all derived from

7851.76 --> 7856.079000000001
the sphere

7854.079 --> 7859.92
which is incorrect because it's derived

7856.079 --> 7862.48
from the celestial sphere in relation to

7859.92 --> 7863.28
the flat earth underneath it

7862.48 --> 7865.36
right

7863.28 --> 7869.719

7865.36 --> 7869.719
they don't say that in the wiki

no corners

you're having trouble

visualizing a rectangle shape with no

corners

well it's not a shape

it's very simple you take

7989.92 --> 7994.0
one end of the map

7991.92 --> 7996.96
you attach it to the other side and then

7994.0 --> 7999.04
you just keep scrolling

it's not that difficult

do i need to drag a literal animation in

8141.92 --> 8147.679
google immediately as soon as i

clicked in the box it immediately picked

8147.679 --> 8152.639
up the word square earth cosmology

8150.56 --> 8155.76
then they do the youtube search and it's

8152.639 --> 8155.76
just not there

it should still say a deleted channel

the best animation of it that i've ever

8300.16 --> 8303.399
a video

8304.639 --> 8309.679
in this presentation oh there will be a

8307.12 --> 8312.319000000001
lot more crap

8309.679 --> 8313.92
yeah that's another one

8312.319 --> 8317.719
it's not

8313.92 --> 8317.719000000001
what i'm looking for

8323.679 --> 8328.88
i don't get it where the hell are these

8326.08 --> 8331.88
videos like why aren't they even into my

8328.88 --> 8331.88
list

8343.04 --> 8349.12
like where the [ __ ] are my bookmarks

8346.96 --> 8353.559
i had all these bookmarks from this

8349.12 --> 8353.559000000001
channel where the hell are they

8374.0 --> 8378.639
okay now i'm gonna check out my freaking

8376.08 --> 8378.639
computer

8379.519 --> 8384.12
gotta at least still have the video

8409.84 --> 8413.399
what the [ __ ]

8426.319 --> 8430.279999999999
dammit i have a lot of movies

8432.479 --> 8436.399
okay

8434.0 --> 8439.68
this is really stressing me out

8436.399 --> 8439.68
like where the hell

8440.08 --> 8444.52
where the hell is this channel gone

8479.28 --> 8484.16
okay let me check the chat again if

8481.2 --> 8487.479000000001
you're still out here

8484.16 --> 8487.479
what's that

8496.72 --> 8499.72
no

8500.96 --> 8504.56
that's not it at all

8504.64 --> 8510.64
thanks for the link though but that's

8506.24 --> 8510.64
absolutely not the one i'm looking for

8513.12 --> 8515.76
square earth

8517.6 --> 8522.08
this has to be it

8519.6 --> 8522.08
hold on

8522.399 --> 8526.319
yeah take your sweet ass time

8526.96 --> 8532.399
yes oh my god i still have the video at

8530.16 --> 8532.399
least

8532.72 --> 8536.76
i'm gonna show it to you

8544.96 --> 8549.0
what are you all talking about

8562.0 --> 8564.319
all right

8566.0 --> 8568.24
so

8568.479 --> 8573.92
yeah this was one of his videos

8571.12 --> 8573.92
free energy

8574.24 --> 8579.76
right this shows you how you can imagine

8577.28 --> 8581.92
it looping

8579.76 --> 8585.84
we had like the whole thing modeled out

8581.92 --> 8585.84
pretty amazingly as well

8595.12 --> 8600.240000000002
i mean i wish i had this model that's

8597.12 --> 8600.240000000002
pretty freaking awesome

8602.16 --> 8607.039999999999
let's do it move in come on

8605.439 --> 8608.0
right see

8607.04 --> 8609.92
this

8608.0 --> 8612.56
is

8609.92 --> 8614.56
how we do loop there is no corner it's

8612.56 --> 8617.439
just interconnected

8614.56 --> 8621.439
the volume is rectangular but it is not

8617.439 --> 8625.880000000001
a rectangle it's not rectangle shaped

8621.439 --> 8625.880000000001
it's just the volume is rectangular

8626.16 --> 8629.16
see

8648.24 --> 8652.08
if somebody can help me find this

8650.479 --> 8653.76
channel back

8652.08 --> 8656.16
really appreciate it

8653.76 --> 8659.28
you'll recognize it by this

8656.16 --> 8659.28
quality animation

8666.96 --> 8671.679999999998
that's some amazing side views of this

8669.439 --> 8671.68
too

8679.359 --> 8686.2
oh wait yeah it's actually turning it

8681.28 --> 8686.2
right now this is just so cool man

8697.68 --> 8702.16
like he even has like the holographics

8700.88 --> 8704.479
of the sun

8702.16 --> 8706.08
right what you're seeing there

8704.479 --> 8707.438999999998
like this tent

8706.08 --> 8709.68
type shape

8707.439 --> 8713.28
that's literally the angle from where

8709.68 --> 8716.24
the sun is coming within space

8713.28 --> 8718.720000000001
so this is not like a little tunnel

8716.24 --> 8720.8
that's coming out of the literal sun now

8718.72 --> 8722.96
this is the hollow map yeah the

8720.8 --> 8725.039999999999
holographic manifestation pattern he

8722.96 --> 8727.438999999998
already got that right

8725.04 --> 8729.28
it's freaking amazing

8727.439 --> 8732.319
and this is like

8729.28 --> 8735.560000000001
a video from five years ago or something

8732.319 --> 8735.56
or more

8746.479 --> 8750.84
it's the only other guy that i've even

8748.24 --> 8754.96
come across that is just really

8750.84 --> 8758.960000000001
taking this serious the looping factor

8754.96 --> 8761.519999999999
and then yeah it's the only other guy

8758.96 --> 8763.039999999999
i never even met him never even seen his

8761.52 --> 8765.2
face

8763.04 --> 8767.76
there was some other guys that were

8765.2 --> 8770.560000000001
trying to also kind of do with it but

8767.76 --> 8774.64
they were just hippie dippy weirdos that

8770.56 --> 8777.439
just were not cohesive at all

8774.64 --> 8779.68
so yeah

8777.439 --> 8781.359
it's kind of hard to find anybody that's

8779.68 --> 8783.19
serious about

8781.359 --> 8786.389000000001
the looping realm

8783.19 --> 8786.389000000001
[Music]

8789.7 --> 8794.319000000001
[Music]

8791.92 --> 8798.24
dude what the [ __ ] are you talking about

8794.319 --> 8798.24
this vegan [ __ ] in my chat

8798.479 --> 8805.279999999999
did you just waste

8800.399 --> 8807.119999999999
my time by talking about vegan [ __ ]

8805.28 --> 8809.84
well i'm literally

8807.12 --> 8809.84
trying to find

8810.16 --> 8816.56
like something that was integral to my

8812.8 --> 8816.56
understanding of the looping realm

8817.28 --> 8820.76
thanks a lot

8827.2 --> 8831.319000000001
where's everybody else gone

8845.8 --> 8848.949999999999
[Music]

8849.04 --> 8853.6
all right anyhow i'm gonna take two

8851.12 --> 8855.68
minute break and i'll be right back whoa

8853.6 --> 8858.800000000001
now what

8855.68 --> 8861.04
i've been going for two hours 25 minutes

8858.8 --> 8861.039999999999
wow

8861.84 --> 8867.24
it doesn't feel like that anyway i'll be

8864.0 --> 8867.24
right back

8973.84 --> 8976.84
mm-hmm

8977.359 --> 8981.52
by the way if anybody's interested in

8979.52 --> 8983.6
getting this video which apparently is

8981.52 --> 8988.12
no longer online

8983.6 --> 8988.12
i can send it to you over skype

8991.84 --> 8994.16
oops

8996.08 --> 9002.6
hmm almost shut down oh yes

8998.92 --> 9002.6
[Music]

9006.64 --> 9011.92
awake souls well awake souls i don't

9009.6 --> 9013.28
know what the hell he's doing but he's

9011.92 --> 9018.04
just

9013.28 --> 9018.04
he can't really deal with him

9018.8 --> 9024.16
he has some notion that it might be

9021.76 --> 9025.28
looping or holographic the celestials

9024.16 --> 9027.76
but

9025.28 --> 9028.800000000001
it's just he's doing his own thing and

9027.76 --> 9032.800000000001
he's

9028.8 --> 9034.64
going sideways in many ways

9032.8 --> 9036.08
i do not really

9034.64 --> 9039.92
want to deal with him

9036.08 --> 9040.96
yeah i already watched that link thanks

9039.92 --> 9043.04
but

9040.96 --> 9045.119999999999
yeah it's not helping this is just

9043.04 --> 9048.319000000001
conceptual this is pseudo-romanian

9045.12 --> 9048.319000000001
force-based thinking

9048.72 --> 9052.199999999999
it's not helping

9073.439 --> 9076.16
did always say the name of that chat

9075.28 --> 9077.52
yeah

9076.16 --> 9080.56
i have

9077.52 --> 9080.560000000001
what weren't you there

9082.24 --> 9087.359
the video that i was trying to find that

9085.28 --> 9089.28
i eventually had to plug for my video

9087.359 --> 9092.16
storage

9089.28 --> 9094.16
was from free energy that's what he used

9092.16 --> 9097.84
to be called then he changed his name to

9094.16 --> 9100.84
square cosmology square earth cosmology

9097.84 --> 9103.76
like that's literally the title of his

9100.84 --> 9106.0
channel and now it's gone i can't find

9103.76 --> 9106.0
him

9106.56 --> 9111.119999999999
i couldn't even find it like in my

9108.56 --> 9114.6
subscription list

9111.12 --> 9114.6
it's just gone

9121.93 --> 9125.1
[Music]

9127.88 --> 9141.958999999999
[Music]

9142.96 --> 9145.839999999998
hmm

9164.88 --> 9169.519999999999
2020 nothing since yeah well i don't

9167.84 --> 9171.2
know what's happened dude that guy could

9169.52 --> 9173.84
could be like

9171.2 --> 9176.240000000002
dead from the facts

9173.84 --> 9177.52
he could literally be dead

9176.24 --> 9179.52
i don't know

9177.52 --> 9183.6
i don't know anything about the guy i

9179.52 --> 9185.92
don't know how wise he was or

9183.6 --> 9190.16
like i don't know anything about that

9185.92 --> 9192.08
guy at all i just know that he was doing

9190.16 --> 9194.479
this model thing

9192.08 --> 9197.039999999999
in very impressive visuals

9194.479 --> 9199.039999999999
he had very elaborate ideas about it too

9197.04 --> 9201.52
like even about like

9199.04 --> 9205.359
firmament and that they were like layers

9201.52 --> 9208.0
where angels would be and like very

9205.359 --> 9210.399000000001
very extensive

9208.0 --> 9212.84
did not really believe any of that but

9210.399 --> 9215.039999999999
it was interesting i've never seen

9212.84 --> 9217.52
anybody do that

9215.04 --> 9217.52
like that

9223.68 --> 9228.880000000001
but yeah i just

9226.08 --> 9231.2
okay he'll do the chef so can you find

9228.88 --> 9236.279999999999
his channel or are you confirming that

9231.2 --> 9236.28
his channel isn't doesn't exist anymore

9261.2 --> 9264.2
hmm

9306.479 --> 9311.358999999999
right

9308.72 --> 9313.519999999999
so anyhow yeah i hope everybody

9311.359 --> 9315.52
appreciates this show

9313.52 --> 9319.359
what i'm doing my theme for today

9315.52 --> 9324.0
getting into like actual themes

9319.359 --> 9324.0
not just blabbering about random [ __ ]

9324.319 --> 9330.16
if you really appreciate it

9327.359 --> 9331.52
then yeah please consider donating to my

9330.16 --> 9336.52
paypal

9331.52 --> 9336.52
that keeps me financially afloat

9340.319 --> 9344.68
any bit would be great

9354.399 --> 9356.72
what

9358.319 --> 9361.199999999999
oh there's a book

9361.6 --> 9365.12
no i was not aware of that

9366.84 --> 9370.960000000001
interesting suppression of high physics

9369.68 --> 9373.04
right

9370.96 --> 9375.119999999999
does he mean like a higher dimensional

9373.04 --> 9378.800000000001
physics because he had this idea about

9375.12 --> 9382.479000000001
how light was like fourth dimensional

9378.8 --> 9385.759999999998
like not space dimensional but actual

9382.479 --> 9388.319
higher spatial dimension was very

9385.76 --> 9391.2
interesting and i for me it was a

9388.319 --> 9392.319
connector like yeah

9391.2 --> 9394.960000000001
could be

9392.319 --> 9397.439
right it's non-local holographic well

9394.96 --> 9399.519999999999
how could it be non-local holographic

9397.439 --> 9401.92
well maybe because it's actually fourth

9399.52 --> 9404.720000000001
dimensional

9401.92 --> 9407.960000000001
and yeah

9404.72 --> 9407.96
could be

9414.24 --> 9417.479
wait what

9439.18 --> 9444.12
[Music]

9441.12 --> 9444.12
um

9448.78 --> 9451.979000000001
[Music]

9462.96 --> 9468.96
wait what

9465.439 --> 9468.960000000001
why is he called roman

9469.84 --> 9472.8
oh

9470.72 --> 9476.08
and i'm already subscribed what the hell

9472.8 --> 9476.08
so he changed the name

9476.16 --> 9480.0
okay well at least the channel still why

9477.92 --> 9481.439
the [ __ ] would he just call himself

9480.0 --> 9483.84
roman that's like the most

9481.439 --> 9486.960000000001
indistinguishable

9483.84 --> 9488.8
name ever okay thank you thank you

9486.96 --> 9490.96
thank you for figuring that out for me

9488.8 --> 9492.319
hill to the chef i really appreciate it

9490.96 --> 9494.24
yeah

9492.319 --> 9497.519999999999
his channel name is still called free

9494.24 --> 9498.56
energy but like the title now is roman

9497.52 --> 9501.359
with an

9498.56 --> 9501.359
orange r

9502.24 --> 9507.039999999999
okay well at least the channel still

9504.08 --> 9509.12
exists that that's a big relief

9507.04 --> 9510.319000000001
thank you for figuring that out hell to

9509.12 --> 9511.84
the chef

9510.319 --> 9513.84
that's awesome

9511.84 --> 9516.08
i'll link

9513.84 --> 9518.64
it up for you guys to check it out

9516.08 --> 9519.68
there's many animations there

9518.64 --> 9524.399
the one i

9519.68 --> 9524.399
showed earlier was also made by him

9529.12 --> 9534.0
is a book from true yeah

9530.88 --> 9534.839999999998
i'd love to have that book

9534.0 --> 9537.439
if

9534.84 --> 9539.6
anybody would

9537.439 --> 9542.56
get it for me and send it to me i'm not

9539.6 --> 9542.56
gonna pay for that

9543.359 --> 9547.92
but it

9544.479 --> 9547.92
like i would like to have it

9548.56 --> 9553.279999999999
just can't really afford to spend money

9550.96 --> 9553.279999999999
on it

9555.359 --> 9561.569
but anyway thanks that's a big relief

9558.41 --> 9561.569
[Music]

9561.84 --> 9567.12
suppression of the ether oh dear

9564.72 --> 9568.88
well look he might call it the electric

9567.12 --> 9571.359
ether

9568.88 --> 9573.199999999999
i certainly hope it's not gonna be any

9571.359 --> 9575.56
freaking light either that would be very

9573.2 --> 9578.62
wacky

9575.56 --> 9578.619999999999
[Music]

9581.04 --> 9585.359
although dude maybe if it light is

9583.359 --> 9589.04
fourth dimensional maybe then the ether

9585.359 --> 9591.76
works like really well i don't know

9589.04 --> 9593.6
i i stay away from the concept of

9591.76 --> 9596.399
light-based ether so

9593.6 --> 9598.24
it's just pointless it's only reified

9596.399 --> 9600.319
that's the only thing it is it's reified

9598.24 --> 9602.16
it's a reification based on a false

9600.319 --> 9603.119999999999
assumption of what light is in the first

9602.16 --> 9604.16
place

9603.12 --> 9607.12
namely

9604.16 --> 9609.039999999999
that it is just as matter

9607.12 --> 9611.68
like an atom

9609.04 --> 9611.68
which it isn't

9613.359 --> 9617.12
but

9614.16 --> 9619.119999999999
okay it's that atom atomized thing or

9617.12 --> 9620.800000000001
it's a wave and then it makes absolutely

9619.12 --> 9622.720000000001
no sense and you have to literally

9620.8 --> 9624.72
conjure up a medium in order for it to

9622.72 --> 9627.92
be a wave that's where the light ether

9624.72 --> 9632.92
comes from it's a completely pointless

9627.92 --> 9632.92
concept based on a false premise

9661.439 --> 9666.479000000001
traditional

9662.88 --> 9671.358999999999
chinese square of course what

9666.479 --> 9675.399
what since when the traditional what

9671.359 --> 9675.399000000001
i didn't know they have one

9678.72 --> 9680.96
huh

9683.92 --> 9688.08
but yeah no surprise the jesuits are per

9686.399 --> 9690.16
definition the ones that are just

9688.08 --> 9693.76
destroying knowledge they always have

9690.16 --> 9693.76
and they will continue to do so

9693.92 --> 9697.76
so yeah oh if the jesuits are against

9696.72 --> 9700.0
something

9697.76 --> 9702.880000000001
you better damn well believe that there

9700.0 --> 9704.8
is some real important truth there

9702.88 --> 9708.399
because that's the only thing jesuits

9704.8 --> 9711.278999999999
ever do attack the truth

9708.399 --> 9714.08
like the truth that nobody wants to know

9711.279 --> 9716.399000000001
about especially that truth

9714.08 --> 9718.24
that's what they attack

9716.399 --> 9721.64
it's what they've been doing since they

9718.24 --> 9727.93
came into being

9721.64 --> 9727.93
[Music]

9748.88 --> 9754.0
interesting anyway

9750.8 --> 9756.56
i think i'm going to round out the show

9754.0 --> 9758.56
going for

9756.56 --> 9760.8
two hours 40 minutes it's been

9758.56 --> 9762.8
interesting though and it's good to yeah

9760.8 --> 9765.039999999999
it's good to have you in here

9762.8 --> 9767.119999999999
ill to the chef i was almost gonna ban

9765.04 --> 9770.6
you earlier

9767.12 --> 9770.6
glad i didn't

9780.319 --> 9784.0
their own title is a lie yes because

9782.399 --> 9788.08
they are

9784.0 --> 9790.24
satanists priests

9788.08 --> 9792.56
and oh yes they might look the thing

9790.24 --> 9796.399
about those types is that they don't

9792.56 --> 9796.399
always know even what they are

9797.04 --> 9801.12
not really

9798.88 --> 9802.64
or they might literally be hiding it

9801.12 --> 9804.880000000001
from their own consciousness that

9802.64 --> 9806.8
they're actually evil because they don't

9804.88 --> 9808.96
want to believe their evil but they'll

9806.8 --> 9811.438999999998
still do the things that

9808.96 --> 9813.278999999999
you do as a jesuit

9811.439 --> 9817.2
you just don't want to know about it

9813.279 --> 9819.52
consciously that can happen too that's

9817.2 --> 9819.52
yeah

9822.479 --> 9828.0
but everything they do is always evil

9825.68 --> 9830.399
always destruction of knowledge always

9828.0 --> 9832.64
moving away from god always

9830.399 --> 9835.92
destroyer of insights

9832.64 --> 9835.92
that's what the jesuits are

9841.68 --> 9845.84
and uh

9844.8 --> 9847.679999999998
