7.77 --> 42.42
[Music]

38.57 --> 46.829
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.42 --> 52.769000000000005
early-bird number 152 I'm your host

46.829 --> 56.61
Arwen and today yeah it's kind of same

52.769 --> 60.149
weathers yesterday fresh but still nice

56.61 --> 67.08
and sunny a couple of clouds I can't see

60.149 --> 73.05
and he camp drills so far hold on let me

67.08 --> 76.369
show you I had a sentence behind the

73.05 --> 76.369
clouds currently

84.59 --> 97.46000000000001
still yeah nice spring day so let's see

91.579 --> 103.149
who's here hello righteous force Juan

97.46 --> 111.58999999999999
Carlos Daniel Orinoco Womble Glassjaw

103.149 --> 127.819
James Mays Rambo Shambo Oprah Mukul four

111.59 --> 130.06900000000002
in each some mas yeah so yeah I just

127.819 --> 132.44
figured out that Nathan for some reason

130.069 --> 135.56
went live in an hour early which is

132.44 --> 139.79
quite weird for him to do that on a

135.56 --> 146.87
Thursday I don't know why I'm actually

139.79 --> 151.67
gonna just check it out what maybe he

146.87 --> 153.829
has something very special I didn't see

151.67 --> 160.06
the article but that was very concise

153.829 --> 160.06
anyway so okay right

169.4 --> 177.53
let's see I don't know does he wants a

173.45 --> 181.099
challenge my show and see what my

177.53 --> 185.0
audience would prefer to watch maybe I

181.099 --> 187.79
don't know I don't know what I asked him

185.0 --> 189.709
on skype hey why are you going live in

187.79 --> 197.84
our early no response

189.709 --> 201.95
so whatever all I know is that I went to

197.84 --> 204.47
bed pretty early for my doing and now it

201.95 --> 209.569
turns out that like right after that all

204.47 --> 211.489
these interesting videos went life so I

209.569 --> 216.95
miss those yeah but I would have had to

211.489 --> 218.959
stay up for till four o'clock so I'm not

216.95 --> 221.569
too sorry that and didn't see it at the

218.959 --> 224.56900000000002
time anyway Oh Owen Benjamin did

221.569 --> 230.06
something hang out apparently about the

224.569 --> 231.70899999999997
meaning of words my god 3 hours and 21

230.06 --> 234.56
minutes 22 minutes

231.709 --> 239.06
it's crazy long but it's bound to be

234.56 --> 243.669
very interesting and also yeah there's

239.06 --> 248.18
this kind of not too widely mentioned

243.669 --> 253.31
video of Eddie Bravo and Alex Jones

248.18 --> 259.25
doing a tinfoil hat with Sam Tripoli

253.31 --> 261.979
a podcast it's kind of has the same kind

259.25 --> 266.419
of feel as with the Joe Rogan except

261.979 --> 269.96
it's more more slang ish like a lot of

266.419 --> 274.669
cursing goes on and yeah but I don't

269.96 --> 276.62
know I'm at 35 minutes now yeah the

274.669 --> 278.599
video was disrupted for some reason

276.62 --> 283.4
yesterday so I couldn't finish watching

278.599 --> 285.26
it and it's pretty interesting I'll link

283.4 --> 287.65
it in chat so you guys can take a look

285.26 --> 287.65
at it

289.89 --> 300.55
that's a pretty good podcast when was it

297.03 --> 302.59
yeah it's three days old now I don't

300.55 --> 307.59000000000003
know maybe yes some of you have seen it

302.59 --> 310.86999999999995
already but yeah that happened and I

307.59 --> 316.81
completely missed out on a secret show

310.87 --> 319.39
from Patricia and Marx Arjun I have a

316.81 --> 322.06
couple of hours to catch up on I don't

319.39 --> 324.28
know if any of you have watched it if

322.06 --> 326.64
you could give me an update that would

324.28 --> 326.64
be nice

327.01 --> 331.38
oh yeah hello Julie Bennett by the way

338.48 --> 349.85
baby day for Nathan you mean he's his

346.85 --> 352.18
wife is giving birth then tomorrow

349.85 --> 356.41
supposedly huh

352.18 --> 356.41
okay didn't know that

380.999 --> 389.399
hmm right yeah Daniel that's that's an

386.729 --> 394.049
interesting deduction based piece of

389.399 --> 396.059
reasoning I'd have to yeah I mentioned

394.049 --> 401.93899999999996
he counters my argument that light

396.059 --> 405.16900000000004
travels instantaneously by laser speed

401.939 --> 405.16900000000004
measuring devices

411.349 --> 419.24
it is kind of interesting although look

413.869 --> 422.93
I think I can still explain explain how

419.24 --> 426.11
that could have been deduced because

422.93 --> 428.659
yeah light can still in my opinion

426.11 --> 435.83000000000004
travel instantaneous but yeah if it's

428.659 --> 440.569
going to be hitting an object then if

435.83 --> 443.68899999999996
that object is moving yeah that may have

440.569 --> 447.319
like a kind of almost like a prismatic

443.689 --> 449.569
effect where it would somehow increase

447.319 --> 453.83000000000004
the frequency because of the speed and

449.569 --> 460.209
they could potentially deduce a speed

453.83 --> 463.849
ratio from this effect so I don't think

460.209 --> 468.319
they measure it by the distance or the

463.849 --> 471.229
speed of the light merely the frequency

468.319 --> 475.159
change due to the involvement of a

471.229 --> 477.86
motioning object I don't know maybe yeah

475.159 --> 482.029
maybe that does maybe it's just crazy I

477.86 --> 483.74
don't know I think I have to look a

482.029 --> 487.05899999999997
little bit more detailed into how the

483.74 --> 489.889
measuring process actually takes place

487.059 --> 492.74
what they actually do not just point a

489.889 --> 495.8
laser at it and there's a readout you

492.74 --> 499.039
know I want to know how they measure

495.8 --> 501.519
that in order to figure out how that

499.039 --> 501.519
works

508.15 --> 519.0
okay Ragnar I have no idea I have no

515.11 --> 519.0
memory of blocking anyone

526.62 --> 529.73
let me check

580.869 --> 583.869
nope

586.55 --> 595.66
no I don't know why you said that but I

591.29 --> 595.66
don't see you blocked here nope

599.03 --> 602.159
[Music]

603.37 --> 607.76
all right

604.82 --> 611.3900000000001
I think you're a fake troll because yeah

607.76 --> 616.12
you're I know who you are and it's not

611.39 --> 616.12
in there so

633.92 --> 639.3499999999999
okay your and you don't seem to be a

637.459 --> 641.029
fake sock account at least so I don't

639.35 --> 643.759
know what's going on but I just look

641.029 --> 646.67
through my blocked list all the sucks

643.759 --> 648.379
that I've been hiding from channel and

646.67 --> 651.829
you're not in there

648.379 --> 653.779
nobody by your name or even close so I

651.829 --> 655.399
don't know what's going on you know

653.779 --> 666.939
maybe it's just YouTube screwing around

655.399 --> 666.939
I don't know right

677.65 --> 682.8
[Music]

680.05 --> 682.8
ah really

685.59 --> 688.7
ah [ __ ]

691.76 --> 704.8389999999999
oh damn it okay Julian Assange has been

697.699 --> 708.649
arrested because Ecuador tore up the

704.839 --> 711.6990000000001
asylum deal goody oh my god he doesn't

708.649 --> 718.25
look very good by the way

711.699 --> 725.649
looks kind of messed up that must be a

718.25 --> 725.649
huge shock let's see

734.199 --> 742.18
share it for a moment yeah that sucks

743.23 --> 745.86
huh

752.579 --> 758.769
okay well I'll keep an eye on that

755.85 --> 761.1990000000001
because I don't wish the guy any harm I

758.769 --> 765.19
don't think he's done anything wrong

761.199 --> 768.43
it's been extremely mild but I don't

765.19 --> 772.72
know maybe they got some plan for him as

768.43 --> 774.9699999999999
creative force him out of actual

772.72 --> 778.72
integrity freedom and force him on the

774.97 --> 780.37
political rail or something through a

778.72 --> 784.23
deal I don't know where where it's gonna

780.37 --> 784.23
go with him I hope you'll be all right

794.82 --> 801.72
yeah well it's just on the news right

798.04 --> 801.7199999999999
now so just happen

816.56 --> 820.3889999999999
yeah that's just insane

828.75 --> 839.92
yeah Trump better damn well pardon him

832.449 --> 842.17
and stop him just don't leave the

839.92 --> 845.759
tension on there too much because like

842.17 --> 845.759
this guy really doesn't deserve it

871.2 --> 877.9000000000001
mmm yeah our Ramo Jambo reality is a

875.68 --> 883.9
distraction everything is a distraction

877.9 --> 888.6899999999999
to them they turn standard proceedings

883.9 --> 893.0699999999999
through timing into a distraction so

888.69 --> 893.07
yeah probably

900.67 --> 907.0889999999999
so yeah I am open for guests

909.98 --> 922.22
I really nathan is kicking ass you say

914.709 --> 924.56
let's see so they claim that obstruction

922.22 --> 927.5600000000001
at the horizon is earth curving so it's

924.56 --> 928.13
only in one axis as you look out in this

927.56 --> 931.5999999999999
picture

928.13 --> 934.899
alright he's up against glowers alright

931.6 --> 934.899
duty for him

946.15 --> 950.64
yeah panel let's see

969.45 --> 974.49
okay I just put out the link in the

971.55 --> 979.459
master beat yet I might just throw it in

974.49 --> 981.839
chat over here you know because yeah

979.459 --> 985.4699999999999
lots of things that I kind of want to

981.839 --> 988.0790000000001
watch but yeah that I haven't watched I

985.47 --> 996.899
don't have a lot of things to talk about

988.079 --> 1000.17
yeah I've been through my own journey in

996.899 --> 1004.94
a way it's very fascinating rats I read

1000.17 --> 1007.899
up on some articles about psionic

1004.94 --> 1011.0600000000001
testing in the military

1007.899 --> 1013.85
apparently yeah in Russia it's very

1011.06 --> 1016.9699999999999
fascinating in what they describe about

1013.85 --> 1020.2090000000001
things that they were supposedly capable

1016.97 --> 1023.2090000000001
of doing just try to cross-reference

1020.209 --> 1027.079
that with my own experience and I think

1023.209 --> 1030.4099999999999
that yeah you know what that kind of

1027.079 --> 1032.0
training that could work whatever

1030.41 --> 1035.5690000000002
they're doing I hope it's not too

1032.0 --> 1038.419
gruesome but if it's some certain types

1035.569 --> 1043.04
of disciplines or like patterns of focus

1038.419 --> 1046.939
in order to be able to control all these

1043.04 --> 1049.7
effects just natural aside effects it

1046.939 --> 1052.22
seems for me at least I don't know with

1049.7 --> 1053.96
other people might work differently but

1052.22 --> 1056.69
MIT just makes me think like yeah well

1053.96 --> 1058.88
maybe all these side effects that I've

1056.69 --> 1062.54
been having those could be developed

1058.88 --> 1064.8700000000001
into real psionic skills that would be

1062.54 --> 1064.87
fascinating

1071.779 --> 1081.69
anyway yeah other than that I don't have

1075.539 --> 1084.99
a lot a lot of relevant news about Flat

1081.69 --> 1089.94
Earth yeah except yesterday it was a

1084.99 --> 1094.049
pretty heavy hangout and the Bates were

1089.94 --> 1097.529
also interesting anyway I'm putting the

1094.049 --> 1100.8899999999999
link out in public for now so anyone who

1097.529 --> 1104.34
wants to join my panel flat earther

1100.89 --> 1109.95
globe or whoever Jessica Murphy wants to

1104.34 --> 1111.48
come on sure anyone is welcome except if

1109.95 --> 1114.1200000000001
you're just gonna be an ass

1111.48 --> 1118.94
then I will snipe you out pretty quickly

1114.12 --> 1118.9399999999998
so please do behave

1119.37 --> 1123.56
[Music]

1141.32 --> 1148.27
yeah

1143.87 --> 1148.27
sure P Mars wants to come on

1155.89 --> 1162.9
I don't see him lurking or is he lurking

1158.65 --> 1162.9
at the Flat Earth debates I don't know

1163.02 --> 1173.41
anyway yeah I've been thinking also I

1171.34 --> 1175.6299999999999
should probably be we trying to

1173.41 --> 1180.8200000000002
rearrange how I do certain things in

1175.63 --> 1182.92
this show and like ask for subscribing

1180.82 --> 1184.6
and plugging and all that at the

1182.92 --> 1190.39
beginning of the show and not just do

1184.6 --> 1192.61
the weather report so I'm gonna try to

1190.39 --> 1194.3200000000002
remember I'm just gonna make another

1192.61 --> 1197.05
list and just remind myself

1194.32 --> 1200.77
oh yes start out doing that but anyway

1197.05 --> 1203.4099999999999
I'm gonna do it now so yeah please I'm

1200.77 --> 1206.62
still gonna continue the video but

1203.41 --> 1208.63
please upload it if you're liking it so

1206.62 --> 1210.6399999999999
far and download it if you're a troll or

1208.63 --> 1214.75
whatever and you can also come on the

1210.64 --> 1218.5200000000002
panel and share with me what's bothering

1214.75 --> 1222.18
you about my show or about what I do or

1218.52 --> 1226.3
some arguments you want to put forth and

1222.18 --> 1229.5700000000002
yeah share the show especially yeah

1226.3 --> 1232.3899999999999
afterwards of course also but especially

1229.57 --> 1235.72
during because then other people may may

1232.39 --> 1239.47
want to interact while it's still going

1235.72 --> 1241.54
so please share the show and yeah add me

1239.47 --> 1244.89
on skype my skype address is in the

1241.54 --> 1248.28
description box below that's a way to

1244.89 --> 1252.3400000000001
contact me on a regular basis and

1248.28 --> 1255.16
discuss things and get you this the best

1252.34 --> 1257.53
way to get a one-on-one interview set up

1255.16 --> 1264.72
if that is what you prefer and not so

1257.53 --> 1268.1499999999999
open in a panel and yeah I I do ask

1264.72 --> 1271.1200000000001
financial contribution on a voluntary

1268.15 --> 1272.8600000000001
basis so anyone that would like to hit

1271.12 --> 1275.4399999999998
the super chat I would very much

1272.86 --> 1278.3799999999999
appreciate it I will name you I will

1275.44 --> 1281.23
shout you out and I will read out the

1278.38 --> 1283.24
text whatever it may be if it's just if

paypal which is very useful to me and

1297.75 --> 1303.61
for the progress of the show and the

1300.28 --> 1308.26
technology that I can acquire to improve

1303.61 --> 1310.08
it still on the long run trying to save

1308.26 --> 1313.6
up for that p900

1310.08 --> 1317.5
so I can do other videos and continue

1313.6 --> 1320.08
some real useful moon footage videos

1317.5 --> 1322.9
that so far it just been webcam based

1320.08 --> 1325.6299999999999
and there's barely anything really so

1322.9 --> 1330.01
yeah please donate to my super chat and

1325.63 --> 1342.22
too much to my paper so let's continue

1330.01 --> 1345.91
the show mmm I'm completely open four

1342.22 --> 1349.17
panels for panel members I'm just gonna

1345.91 --> 1349.17
read through the chat right now

1358.95 --> 1364.95
ha

1360.6 --> 1368.81
okay and Jason McCormick wife one wants

1380.289 --> 1385.989
offering I haven't considered patreon so

1383.229 --> 1389.289
far there's a lot of other people I know

1385.989 --> 1393.489
that I've seen that do do that yeah I

1389.289 --> 1396.129
might at this point I don't know if it

1393.489 --> 1398.549
is more convenient for some people to do

1396.129 --> 1401.6789999999999
it through that system than just donate

1398.549 --> 1406.539
whenever they want through PayPal then

1401.679 --> 1409.0590000000002
yeah I might also do that why not oh I

1406.539 --> 1410.59
should at least look into it look into

1409.059 --> 1414.549
the conditions and everything and just

1410.59 --> 1418.389
see see if I should do something with

1414.549 --> 1425.379
that or not you know maybe it's just an

1418.389 --> 1431.7289999999998
extra option why not really you think so

1425.379 --> 1431.7289999999998
Daniel okay okay if you say so

1443.37 --> 1452.9399999999998
huh all right well maybe I will thank

1448.38 --> 1456.21
you for the tip I guess I'll have to

1452.94 --> 1460.76
remind myself that I I'm gonna look into

1456.21 --> 1460.76
that just gonna make a newt

1467.94 --> 1478.6200000000001
alright okay let's see

1485.2 --> 1490.66
we're the subjects yesterday on the show

1487.66 --> 1496.0600000000002
I was talking about the whole light

1490.66 --> 1503.01
concept about if anybody could 'forward

1496.06 --> 1503.01
some kind of proof of an indivisible

1503.64 --> 1512.71
light yeah light quantity unit which

1509.83 --> 1516.76
would be required nante seating for an

1512.71 --> 1519.31
actual yeah indivisible particle concept

1516.76 --> 1521.97
for light i would ya asking for that

1519.31 --> 1529.69
still yeah that's gonna take some time

1521.97 --> 1535.21
before people figure that out enough

1529.69 --> 1539.88
that they can look into it and other

1535.21 --> 1539.88
than that what was it

1543.47 --> 1549.8790000000001
I had talked about gas pressure

1546.309 --> 1549.879
presuppositional systems

1555.6 --> 1563.279
I don't know I guess the usual and I

1560.129 --> 1565.9499999999998
think I I didn't even watch my own show

1563.279 --> 1569.07
back it's terrible I'm being really

1565.95 --> 1571.6190000000001
sloppy not doing my homework I should

1569.07 --> 1573.6
watch it back but I think I did a couple

1571.619 --> 1573.9599999999998
of really good explanations here and

1573.6 --> 1577.83
there

1573.96 --> 1579.69
it felt really high energy when I was

1577.83 --> 1582.72
doing it I just don't exactly remember

1579.69 --> 1586.44
what it was because I haven't watched it

1582.72 --> 1589.169
back and yeah I do a lot of things very

1586.44 --> 1592.95
intuitively it really just happens in

1589.169 --> 1596.419
the moment and then afterwards I can

1592.95 --> 1599.849
kind of let it sink in what happened

1596.419 --> 1601.71
unless during the process I have to

1599.849 --> 1606.859
repeat it over and over and over again

1601.71 --> 1610.019
and then yeah it will stick very much so

1606.859 --> 1612.6589999999999
whether it was created intuitively or

1610.019 --> 1615.749
not oh yeah and I I now remember I did

1612.659 --> 1618.3590000000002
the a very elaborate relative density

1615.749 --> 1623.1290000000001
explanation but that was on the debates

1618.359 --> 1626.779
I was really proud of that I didn't get

1623.129 --> 1629.879
any feedback though because I did yeah

1626.779 --> 1634.139
kind of made both claims with it in the

1629.879 --> 1639.869
relative density Theory a scientific

1634.139 --> 1644.2489999999998
theory and yeah still waiting for

1639.869 --> 1647.099
feedback about that like okay do you

1644.249 --> 1650.479
guys agree with that did I explain it

1647.099 --> 1653.639
right the yeah the relative density

1650.479 --> 1658.349
equilibrium spectrum the spectrum of all

1653.639 --> 1661.889
things in which every every piece of

1658.349 --> 1665.369
matter will try to find its relative

1661.889 --> 1668.309
density equilibrium point within the

1665.369 --> 1675.619
scale spectrum within within the

1668.309 --> 1675.619
gradient of relative density yeah

1681.4 --> 1689.3200000000002
it's funny because like a year ago I

1686.25 --> 1691.72
didn't I had a lot of trouble with the

1689.32 --> 1694.0
relative density concept like I was

1691.72 --> 1696.67
really struggling with that I kind of

1694.0 --> 1702.25
got it but it pissed me off and the

1696.67 --> 1708.19
whole relative concept like it felt like

1702.25 --> 1713.92
it was being unnecessarily confusing but

1708.19 --> 1715.9
the more I've let it just sink in now I

1713.92 --> 1718.18
really get it it's like a whole

1715.9 --> 1724.69
different angle to approaching at all

1718.18 --> 1727.48
and it crystallizes very clearly

1724.69 --> 1729.43
actually it's interesting it's just I

1727.48 --> 1733.27
get it now it took it it took some time

1729.43 --> 1737.38
but I get relative density now and I

1733.27 --> 1740.53
still get how gravity is yeah I wouldn't

1737.38 --> 1743.92
say gravity is completely superfluous

1740.53 --> 1747.85
it's just another approach to it without

1743.92 --> 1751.89
yeah basically building and harness on

1747.85 --> 1754.7199999999998
the aberration of it it still works

1751.89 --> 1758.5900000000001
unless you're gonna build all these

1754.72 --> 1761.29
weird mutations like mass attracting

1758.59 --> 1764.1699999999998
mass and bending of space-time and all

1761.29 --> 1767.35
these priests yeah elaborations on the

1764.17 --> 1770.5900000000001
presupposition that gravity is literally

1767.35 --> 1775.8
a thing and that's when it gets really

1770.59 --> 1778.1499999999999
crazy and out there and science fictiony

1775.8 --> 1782.3999999999999
and you don't have that with relative

1778.15 --> 1782.4
density because it just doesn't address

1784.3 --> 1793.3899999999999
it doesn't address it all the yeah it

1788.47 --> 1796.51
doesn't even proclaim a cause as to why

1793.39 --> 1798.5800000000002
things are the way they are what propels

1796.51 --> 1801.52
it it just points at look there's

1798.58 --> 1805.27
relative density it it's causing

1801.52 --> 1807.76
displacement the force and this is how

1805.27 --> 1810.8799999999999
it behaves in this very specific type of

1807.76 --> 1812.8
way and that's provable you can very

1810.88 --> 1815.17
manipulate the independent variable and

1812.8 --> 1817.69
it works out exactly as predicted and

1815.17 --> 1825.01
that makes it scientific and that's the

1817.69 --> 1828.4
difference and it's just funny how yeah

1825.01 --> 1833.59
how it's so contrasting in its nature

1828.4 --> 1836.44
yet it does just work but it's a little

1833.59 --> 1840.809
confusing if you're used to entertaining

1836.44 --> 1840.809
the conceptualization of gravity

1846.49 --> 1852.34
how do I explain the direction of it

1849.55 --> 1854.86
though yeah well that's just how the

1852.34 --> 1857.5
gradient is that's that's how the

1854.86 --> 1861.58
relative density gradients appears to be

1857.5 --> 1866.38
and there is no cause for that it's just

1861.58 --> 1869.5
the way it is naturally perceived the

1866.38 --> 1873.8500000000001
higher densities seem to order

1869.5 --> 1877.42
themselves as much there as they can and

1873.85 --> 1880.6299999999999
the lighter densities there in a

1877.42 --> 1882.8400000000001
spectrum if you have to order yeah you

1880.63 --> 1886.7800000000002
can clearly order you can make a

1882.84 --> 1889.33
spectrum of relative density types and

1886.78 --> 1891.3999999999999
you can categorize all kinds of

1889.33 --> 1894.6399999999999
materials within them and just say yeah

1891.4 --> 1896.26
if they were all just roughly mixed

1894.64 --> 1898.45
together this is how it would order

1896.26 --> 1900.61
themselves because of their relative

1898.45 --> 1902.92
density relations with each other

1900.61 --> 1905.26
because it's always relative to the rest

1902.92 --> 1908.01
of matter that's the way it is

1905.26 --> 1908.01
conceptualized

1916.74 --> 1927.39
yeah I I I'm not lying and I'm taking as

1921.299 --> 1932.6589999999999
far as I can which is - yeah - its

1927.39 --> 1937.3200000000002
conclusion - this is how it works okay

1932.659 --> 1941.669
that's that science it's a self-standing

1937.32 --> 1944.49
system that yeah abides by the

1941.669 --> 1947.429
scientific method and that works and it

1944.49 --> 1949.38
doesn't matter it really doesn't even

1947.429 --> 1953.21
matter where it comes from

1949.38 --> 1954.63
that's if you're gonna do that then yeah

1953.21 --> 1957.029
you would

1954.63 --> 1958.98
whatever you're gonna conceive is always

1957.029 --> 1961.409
gonna end up at some place where you

1958.98 --> 1969.059
don't know and then it doesn't work out

1961.409 --> 1971.5200000000002
really it's like asking from a

1969.059 --> 1977.21
heliocentric perspective perspective

1971.52 --> 1980.73
why does mass cause gravity supposedly

1977.21 --> 1985.409
in your conceptualization of it not even

1980.73 --> 1987.98
in the actual systems but why does it do

1985.409 --> 1987.98
that yeah

1993.17 --> 2000.65
supposedly right well if you don't have

1998.67 --> 2002.8400000000001
an answer to that then why should we

2000.65 --> 2009.0400000000002
have an answer as to why relative

2002.84 --> 2009.04
density causes displacement you know

2014.769 --> 2019.58
that's not what science is even about

2017.24 --> 2021.679
it's not about the total structure of it

2019.58 --> 2024.97
and however we would like it to be no

2021.679 --> 2029.659
it's about taking a separate thing and

2024.97 --> 2033.019
then just making sure that is correct

2029.659 --> 2036.5
and that it always works out and that is

2033.019 --> 2040.269
how you build science the real science

2036.5 --> 2040.269
using the scientific method

2041.18 --> 2044.499
[Music]

2048.84 --> 2052.739
[Music]

2057.59 --> 2064.29
and what

2059.88 --> 2068.96
right flirty bean avakov oh well thank

2064.29 --> 2074.97
you for your input and I'm not attacking

2068.96 --> 2079.56
Brenda I well I try not to look she's

2074.97 --> 2082.02
just a weird person and she has serious

2079.56 --> 2084.66
issues which are part of her character

2082.02 --> 2087.33
and she even does her best in her own

2084.66 --> 2090.42
way and it's very hard to even take

2087.33 --> 2096.35
notice of that because she always kind

2090.42 --> 2099.69
of sounds the same but yeah I've had

2096.35 --> 2101.94
relatively good conversations with her

2099.69 --> 2103.7400000000002
but if she's gonna yeah if she's gonna

2101.94 --> 2106.92
be like grilled by Nathan yeah she's

2103.74 --> 2109.08
gonna go totally tilt and there's

2106.92 --> 2111.9300000000003
nothing really to be done about it it's

2109.08 --> 2113.85
just all I can do basically it's just

2111.93 --> 2117.3799999999997
laugh about it because it's just out of

2113.85 --> 2125.33
control and silly really

2117.38 --> 2125.33
so I'm not really on a bandwagon

2129.8 --> 2137.6000000000004
yeah Juan Carlos I wouldn't know I've

2132.65 --> 2140.9300000000003
never seen an image of her she calls her

2137.6 --> 2144.3399999999997
at her and whatever voice is I don't

2140.93 --> 2147.1699999999996
know if she was born a he I don't know

2144.34 --> 2149.96
maybe I don't think so

2147.17 --> 2157.66
I don't know I don't care that much

2149.96 --> 2159.13
really it's just a stupid distraction

2157.66 --> 2162.77
[Music]

2159.13 --> 2167.56
I'm more interested just in her

2162.77 --> 2173.84
knowledge and how she categorizes things

2167.56 --> 2180.14
and yeah not so much in her as a person

2173.84 --> 2183.83
oh really

2180.14 --> 2189.37
holy [ __ ] I don't know if that's true

2183.83 --> 2189.37
but you must have missed that part

2205.72 --> 2217.2799999999997
so yeah I've put the link out here still

2209.059 --> 2220.27
nobody's joining come on guys or you

2217.28 --> 2220.27
don't feel like it

2224.33 --> 2229.67
right oh yeah and I kind of missed yeah

2227.48 --> 2233.14
I had a list when I talked to her about

2229.67 --> 2238.55
that and I missed one because there is

2233.14 --> 2244.22
yeah you're the way you're born there is

2238.55 --> 2245.8100000000004
your sexual preference sort of but

2244.22 --> 2249.37
that's not really gender I don't know

2245.81 --> 2253.49
but it is very important to what yeah

2249.37 --> 2255.95
how you become and then there is how you

2253.49 --> 2258.7099999999996
regard yourself and that is

2255.95 --> 2261.35
psychological and that goes all over the

2258.71 --> 2264.86
place and that is will be new gender is

2261.35 --> 2272.33
emphasized so yeah I missed out on one

2264.86 --> 2274.9100000000003
but well it's so weird every time I see

2272.33 --> 2281.39
somebody and that is like that it's just

2274.91 --> 2285.29
I yeah look who's talking the flatter

2281.39 --> 2286.97
through the societal outcast sort of the

2285.29 --> 2289.79
well-behaved societal healthcast

2286.97 --> 2294.74
whatever but every time I see these

2289.79 --> 2302.24
people it's just like it's like an open

2294.74 --> 2305.81
insanity and like I personally don't

2302.24 --> 2309.3399999999997
even mind but it's just open insanity in

2305.81 --> 2316.18
a way like yeah it's kind of crazy but

2309.34 --> 2316.1800000000003
that's allowed now and it's okay and you

2318.01 --> 2325.13
know it is like with these with these

2321.74 --> 2327.6699999999996
transgenders or even transsexuals or

2325.13 --> 2331.63
whatever if they were just really

2327.67 --> 2334.16
civilized and well behaved then I have

2331.63 --> 2337.4900000000002
absolutely no problem with them and

2334.16 --> 2339.85
that's the funny thing because yeah one

2337.49 --> 2343.1499999999996
of my friends it was an older

2339.85 --> 2348.14
transsexual from an older generation and

2343.15 --> 2350.3
she or originally he but yeah it does

2348.14 --> 2352.31
feel like is she it like I don't regard

2350.3 --> 2354.0800000000004
her in any way as a man it just doesn't

2352.31 --> 2357.92
feel like that but it's taken a lot of

2354.08 --> 2361.39
time but she's extremely civilized and

2357.92 --> 2365.4500000000003
polite and really nice to everyone

2361.39 --> 2367.7599999999998
never has outbursts ever and that's like

2365.45 --> 2372.6099999999997
wow that's awesome that's how it should

2367.76 --> 2375.17
be and that she's kind of yeah bit odd

2372.61 --> 2377.42
it's all transsexuals have to always

2375.17 --> 2379.46
have something odd about them unless

2377.42 --> 2382.82
they have like huge amounts of money to

2379.46 --> 2387.56
spend on cosmetics and everything not

2382.82 --> 2390.6200000000003
this one and but still just a great a

2387.56 --> 2393.56
nice person to interact with beside the

2390.62 --> 2396.5899999999997
oddities and there's not any perversion

2393.56 --> 2399.14
they're not that bad not sexual actually

2396.59 --> 2400.4500000000003
they're not sexual minded or anything at

2399.14 --> 2406.49
all

2400.45 --> 2409.9399999999996
so it's see it is possible you can have

2406.49 --> 2413.83
a civilized transsexual but yeah what we

2409.94 --> 2416.41
get to see is just these crazy

2413.83 --> 2419.75
misbehaving people that are like

2416.41 --> 2423.89
cloaking themselves more they don't

2419.75 --> 2427.43
really like these men saying then that

2423.89 --> 2431.12
they're a woman they don't act womanly

2427.43 --> 2436.85
at all so it seems almost more like a

2431.12 --> 2441.0499999999997
cloak an excuse to claim power it's not

2436.85 --> 2443.8399999999997
genuine it's not the real thing it's a

2441.05 --> 2446.38
manipulation it's wizardry it just feels

2443.84 --> 2446.38
so wrong

2446.51 --> 2449.5
and yeah

2457.91 --> 2464.27
[Music]

2460.21 --> 2466.39
all right Daniel I kind of tend to agree

2464.27 --> 2469.69
because here in the Netherlands there's

2466.39 --> 2473.93
quite a substantial amount of

2469.69 --> 2476.7200000000003
transsexuals including very young ones

2473.93 --> 2478.1299999999997
which is extremely dubious I don't I

2476.72 --> 2482.5
that creeps me out

2478.13 --> 2484.9700000000003
I feel like feels wrong in a way but

2482.5 --> 2487.64
there's literally nothing I can do about

2484.97 --> 2491.54
that except just say it I think that's

2487.64 --> 2494.14
wrong the trans transexual is transit a

2491.54 --> 2500.24
child for any reason it's just wrong

2494.14 --> 2502.79
doesn't make any sense to me but yeah

2500.24 --> 2505.85
there's a lot of them and yeah most of

2502.79 --> 2512.33
them are just I don't know goofy or

2505.85 --> 2513.38
something or tend to behave in a sort of

2512.33 --> 2517.52
like woman act

2513.38 --> 2520.28
maybe but yeah they're there civilized

2517.52 --> 2522.98
people sort of accept yeah they do have

2520.28 --> 2525.02
like these severe many of them many

2522.98 --> 2527.95
transsexuals that are like of the

2525.02 --> 2534.29
younger generations have severe allergic

2527.95 --> 2538.25
reactions so if you yeah if you behave

2534.29 --> 2539.63
in old-fashioned or right-wing ways they

2538.25 --> 2543.2
can't handle that things like

2539.63 --> 2545.09
mansplaining and that kind of thing they

2543.2 --> 2547.7
hate it so badly you should they have

2545.09 --> 2550.73
like extra bad reactions that's weird

2547.7 --> 2552.7999999999997
because normal people that might be

2550.73 --> 2555.05
liberal may just be annoyed by it but

2552.8 --> 2558.0800000000004
many transsexuals just get really pissed

2555.05 --> 2564.4100000000003
off before by it somehow and that by the

2558.08 --> 2567.68
way includes yeah the transsexual that

2564.41 --> 2570.0499999999997
is in my group but in my gaming group

2567.68 --> 2571.79
because she sometimes mentions these

2570.05 --> 2575.0
type of scenarios where she gets really

2571.79 --> 2582.1
pissed off right now AE are so confusing

2575.0 --> 2584.87
to me but not that he has very outspoken

2582.1 --> 2589.49
feminine qualities but is basically

2584.87 --> 2591.24
going through the transition and yeah

2589.49 --> 2594.5099999999998
basically I

2591.24 --> 2597.2099999999996
knew her before they did that and that's

2594.51 --> 2599.28
very confusing to my intuition so I

2597.21 --> 2602.119
constantly make the mistake and like

2599.28 --> 2604.92
[ __ ] that's gonna piss him off

2602.119 --> 2607.17
every time I do it it's like I sorry I

2604.92 --> 2608.51
keep doing it though it's really like ah

2607.17 --> 2614.04
stop it

2608.51 --> 2619.11
my intuition has to give me a break just

2614.04 --> 2621.0
adapt but yeah they're all over the

2619.11 --> 2625.02
place here and they're quite civilized

2621.0 --> 2628.1
until you kind of step on the toes so

2625.02 --> 2631.619
yeah that smile talk about transgenders

2628.1 --> 2633.5699999999997
general and they're not all maniacs at

2631.619 --> 2636.1800000000003
least not here in the Netherlands so far

2633.57 --> 2639.51
that I can see they do creeped me out

2636.18 --> 2644.1
sometimes like the whole freakin bearded

2639.51 --> 2652.07
lady thing that just gah that freaks me

2644.1 --> 2656.5499999999997
the hell out it's so creepy yeah that

2652.07 --> 2658.29
but yeah what we see in America that

2656.55 --> 2665.34
really goes far they they get violent

2658.29 --> 2668.43
and [ __ ] and crazy and busy working yeah

2665.34 --> 2671.67
I don't think we ever have that here and

2668.43 --> 2673.77
if we do it's capture shush and like

2671.67 --> 2677.19
stop it stop doing that highly

2673.77 --> 2682.47
discourage don't get don't get violent

2677.19 --> 2684.06
even for political reasons yeah in the

2682.47 --> 2686.6699999999996
Netherlands that definitely do not like

2684.06 --> 2688.68
violence okay by the way I think yeah

2686.67 --> 2692.75
sorry for keeping you waiting but we've

2688.68 --> 2699.18
been joined by jazz' Conda hello jazz

2692.75 --> 2701.78
welcome back to the panel you're on mute

2699.18 --> 2701.7799999999997
I think

2705.11 --> 2722.57
it's hard to have kept you waiting jazz

2710.63 --> 2731.7200000000003
you there did you fall asleep ah yeah

2722.57 --> 2735.2000000000003
can hear you how are you doing yeah good

2731.72 --> 2735.77
good it's so like going from the bottom

2735.2 --> 2740.33
of the world

2735.77 --> 2745.13
and you're you're kind of muffled I can

2740.33 --> 2747.65
barely make out what you're saying what

2745.13 --> 2749.92
a bit now is it yeah better much better

2747.65 --> 2749.92
much better

2750.1 --> 2759.46
so what he's in on I was just calling in

2754.46 --> 2761.84
from the bottom of the world the yeah

2759.46 --> 2769.2200000000003
the thing of it I just saw on the other

2761.84 --> 2774.7400000000002
side it was odd you know I'm the other

2769.22 --> 2779.27
side in the plane yeah they'd said she

2774.74 --> 2781.39
what caused me to call and was you were

2779.27 --> 2787.6
talking about density and buoyancy again

2781.39 --> 2789.92
now relative density point attendant

2787.6 --> 2792.35
it's one thing I can't get my head

2789.92 --> 2796.37
around because when i if i'm and my

2792.35 --> 2798.88
airplane and i roll to the right let's

2796.37 --> 2802.85
say so my wings

2798.88 --> 2804.86
Harel l to the ground and i put a mix

2802.85 --> 2805.6
right tutor and i'm going three days on

2804.86 --> 2809.27
the jury

2805.6 --> 2813.5
you're constantly slapping your mic with

2809.27 --> 2816.56
your breath so you try to say that it

2813.5 --> 2820.58
yeah it's better to just talk past it

2816.56 --> 2826.64
and not directly in it so but yeah

2820.58 --> 2832.0099999999998
continue um and if i pull us it's it's

2826.64 --> 2835.7599999999998
cold a 3g turn right leaning okay that's

2832.01 --> 2838.2200000000003
it pretty heavy I said more he died oh

2835.76 --> 2842.1800000000003
what a human head weighs come

2838.22 --> 2844.8799999999997
five to six pounds weighs three times

2842.18 --> 2848.5699999999997
that during the five seconds that I'm

2844.88 --> 2851.7200000000003
making that turn right that's what the G

2848.57 --> 2855.9100000000003
is pre supposedly based upon there's a

2851.72 --> 2858.62
measurement it's very convenient

2855.91 --> 2861.73
yeah but here how would you how would

2858.62 --> 2868.3399999999997
you otherwise explain it other than

2861.73 --> 2870.17
might other than my kit is supposed to

2868.34 --> 2872.15
be attached to the center of the earth

2870.17 --> 2874.9
and then armored eminently changing its

2872.15 --> 2878.81
motion well it's very simple you

2874.9 --> 2881.03
separate relative density concept and

2878.81 --> 2885.65
the forces of displacement that happened

2881.03 --> 2889.34
over there from actual provable forces

2885.65 --> 2894.59
applying positing motion besides

2889.34 --> 2898.42
relative density and yeah it's gonna be

2894.59 --> 2901.8500000000004
a certain quantity that is comparable to

2898.42 --> 2903.5
how pressures are divided in a natural

2901.85 --> 2905.9
state in the world when you're basically

2903.5 --> 2910.34
standing on the ground for example yeah

2905.9 --> 2912.8
then you can create a deduction based

2910.34 --> 2915.05
measurement on the normal state and then

2912.8 --> 2917.6600000000003
multiplied and ya say like yeah it's

2915.05 --> 2919.9700000000003
three times as much and if you're gonna

2917.66 --> 2922.19
call it G because your structure that

2919.97 --> 2924.7099999999996
you're basing it on is on the gravity

2922.19 --> 2928.76
assumption yeah this G oh it fits there

2924.71 --> 2931.13
because yeah it's that's this the system

2928.76 --> 2933.5
that's used to calculate that but you

2931.13 --> 2937.12
can definitely insert relative density

2933.5 --> 2942.82
in there as well just the normal

2937.12 --> 2947.63
pressure that is exerted when you're in

2942.82 --> 2950.3300000000004
the sea floor level state basically and

2947.63 --> 2955.04
then just say well multiply normal

2950.33 --> 2957.83
pressure normal no it it's not it's not

2955.04 --> 2961.45
pressure though it's that force it's the

2957.83 --> 2966.14
parent force that it's a velocity victor

2961.45 --> 2967.9399999999996
acceleration away from where that victor

2966.14 --> 2970.64
walls straight down to the center of the

2967.94 --> 2974.7490000000003
earth that's what's causing the Jesus

2970.64 --> 2978.14
now that's completely assumed that is

2974.749 --> 2980.3289999999997
but I know for that at all well it is

2978.14 --> 2982.5789999999997
because it's no Claire's no cross for

2980.329 --> 2986.6600000000003
that and it's good and it's constantly

2982.579 --> 2990.559
the same every time yeah but there is no

2986.66 --> 2993.91
proof of the piece of reasoning that you

2990.559 --> 3002.8590000000004
assume to cause that

2993.91 --> 3005.95
assuming that it is a thing but I you on

3002.859 --> 3008.0789999999997
the flip side are you guys not assuming

3005.95 --> 3013.359
that it's what you're saying because

3008.079 --> 3015.489
that no no we're proving an actual

3013.359 --> 3018.7
cause-and-effect relationship with

3015.489 --> 3024.279
relative densities no but you know

3018.7 --> 3026.71
because yes we are yes we are in C have

3024.279 --> 3030.549
an independent variable that we vary and

3026.71 --> 3033.549
manipulate to prove the cause yes we do

3030.549 --> 3037.93
no you don't yes he's not a constant yes

3033.549 --> 3042.309
it's not a cop you yes we do we prove

3037.93 --> 3044.2
relative density well how is relative

3042.309 --> 3046.1800000000003
density you're talking about density

3044.2 --> 3048.7889999999998
which is the oppression temperature and

3046.18 --> 3050.68
humidity how is that a constant on a day

3048.789 --> 3054.1800000000003
to day changing basis where all those

3050.68 --> 3057.43
factors change how is that a constant a

3054.18 --> 3061.39
constant we're not talking about a

3057.43 --> 3064.18
constant gravity is a constant it's

3061.39 --> 3068.44
relative a relative to watch everything

3064.18 --> 3071.319
else your gravity is a supposed

3068.44 --> 3073.2690000000002
constants but it doesn't exist you can't

3071.319 --> 3075.7889999999998
prove it you can't very manipulate it

3073.269 --> 3077.5589999999997
the relative data is relative and it's

3075.789 --> 3080.67
all relative to everything else and yeah

3077.559 --> 3084.099
there are a lot of influence that change

3080.67 --> 3087.7200000000003
the relative density itself and then it

3084.099 --> 3091.989
will continue still trying to find its

3087.72 --> 3094.5389999999998
new relative density equilibrium points

3091.989 --> 3099.13
in relation to everything else the

3094.539 --> 3100.9300000000003
spectrum of all things well that's what

3099.13 --> 3103.27
I'm having trouble with because if if it

3100.93 --> 3109.69
is relative density

3103.27 --> 3115.21
then let's for example the zero g plane

3109.69 --> 3118.57
to vomit comment would have to fly many

3115.21 --> 3121.27
different parabolas on any given day

3118.57 --> 3128.4900000000002
during due to temperature humidity and

3121.27 --> 3132.55
density to create zero gravity right

3128.49 --> 3135.7599999999998
well that zero gravity again applies the

3132.55 --> 3138.4
assumption of the gravity system based

3135.76 --> 3140.9500000000003
on that to counter it and yeah I agree

3138.4 --> 3144.7000000000003
if there is a certain amount of force

3140.95 --> 3147.46
you apply for acceleration in a

3144.7 --> 3152.68
direction all that then for some reason

3147.46 --> 3155.589
the provable forces that arise in

3152.68 --> 3159.22
relative density in matter itself in

3155.589 --> 3162.22
mass that those forces suddenly are

3159.22 --> 3166.18
negated so there is a completely free

3162.22 --> 3174.0099999999998
float and the relative density effects

3166.18 --> 3177.5989999999997
are negated I agree yes I but you agree

3174.01 --> 3185.82
so how does that work that's yours flat

3177.599 --> 3188.4
because it it works perfectly fine a

3185.82 --> 3193.57
logical question that is just [ __ ]

3188.4 --> 3194.77
really well it's a straw man who doesn't

3193.57 --> 3198.5800000000004
make any damn sense

3194.77 --> 3201.43
has no bearing I just explained to you

3198.58 --> 3203.92
exactly how relative density functions

3201.43 --> 3205.66
with all the aberrations that so

3203.92 --> 3208.06
hopefully suggests gravity that I know

3205.66 --> 3210.0989999999997
everything about you haven't even

3208.06 --> 3212.44
mentioned all the examples you could

3210.099 --> 3215.38
have given and I know them all because

3212.44 --> 3218.619
it's been my focus to actually figure

3215.38 --> 3221.98
out gravity and I I did it's an

3218.619 --> 3224.4100000000003
aberration and I just explained to you

3221.98 --> 3227.97
how relative density explains the

3224.41 --> 3232.66
aberrations basically through a

3227.97 --> 3235.72
scientifically provable system known

3232.66 --> 3241.0299999999997
cause to the forces that can be

3235.72 --> 3242.83
manipulated yes I weren't Allen you're

3241.03 --> 3244.84
an awesome dude and I appreciate talking

3242.83 --> 3249.22
to you but you haven't explained gravity

3244.84 --> 3252.7000000000003
at all because like I was saying before

3249.22 --> 3254.74
with a 3G tune in an Arab land what what

3252.7 --> 3257.0989999999997
happens to a fighter pilot and then 16

3254.74 --> 3259.8399999999997
when they're pulling the 9g max return

3257.099 --> 3262.59
what force is acting on them to weigh

3259.84 --> 3263.83
nine times what they weigh on the ground

3262.59 --> 3268.06
yeah

3263.83 --> 3273.52
acceleration it's a rim velocity that's

3268.06 --> 3276.57
what causes that so if it's the light

3273.52 --> 3280.24
it's a lot of force from actual motion

3276.57 --> 3283.48
provable motion so if that's what you're

3280.24 --> 3288.43
saying by energy by energy from the jet

3283.48 --> 3291.97
fuel and everything no because yes fuel

3288.43 --> 3296.109
creates propulsion by energy

3291.97 --> 3300.04
transformation and that cardio motion in

3296.109 --> 3302.56
its turn could cause us forces depending

3300.04 --> 3305.02
on the trajectory may just be standard

3302.56 --> 3307.21
acceleration in a line or if you're

3305.02 --> 3308.68
gonna make a turn or a very sharp turn

3307.21 --> 3310.69
then there's going to be centripetal

3308.68 --> 3314.47
forces because suddenly there's a

3310.69 --> 3316.66
circular motion gee it feels that she

3314.47 --> 3319.48
got nothing to do with it that has to do

3316.66 --> 3322.1499999999996
with propulsion and velocity but once

3319.48 --> 3326.08
you're at velocity from what you're

3322.15 --> 3328.9900000000002
saying in terms of a fighter jet in if

3326.08 --> 3330.8489999999997
you were on a train every turn you take

3328.99 --> 3337.4199999999996
you're gonna be in your seat that's not

3330.849 --> 3339.28
the case yes it is no turns yeah you're

3337.42 --> 3345.4300000000003
gonna be pushed aside that's what

3339.28 --> 3347.8900000000003
happens yeah same goes for a car or a

3345.43 --> 3349.5099999999998
bus or whatever if you're gonna go in a

3347.89 --> 3351.8199999999997
circular motion there's gonna be

3349.51 --> 3353.8
centripetal forces pushing you to one

3351.82 --> 3359.32
side because you are moving in a circle

3353.8 --> 3361.6600000000003
in a circular pattern yeah but once

3359.32 --> 3366.3900000000003
you're established and that circle

3361.66 --> 3369.0389999999998
you're not accelerating nor decelerating

3366.39 --> 3370.749
you're in a constant vector

3369.039 --> 3372.1890000000003
that changes you will feel the force

3370.749 --> 3374.259
that's right

3372.189 --> 3376.239
acceleration if you're in a constant

3374.259 --> 3378.809
motion then you don't have any forces

3376.239 --> 3381.2490000000003
applied except for air friction or

3378.809 --> 3383.259
whatever time so it's a thing you're

3381.249 --> 3384.549
going through and at the same time but

3383.259 --> 3387.16
if you're going to go in a circular

3384.549 --> 3389.679
motion then there is a constant apparent

3387.16 --> 3392.199
acceleration happening so there will be

3389.679 --> 3394.839
constant push as long as you move in

3392.199 --> 3397.929
that circular motion even at a constant

3394.839 --> 3400.8089999999997
speed so that's exactly what a fighter

3397.929 --> 3403.839
pilot feels you know and they lift off

3400.809 --> 3407.829
the ground five feet above the ground

3403.839 --> 3411.099
Will's up accelerate at 500 knots pull

3407.829 --> 3412.799
back on the step nine G's what's the

3411.099 --> 3417.1890000000003
force

3412.799 --> 3421.419
slamming them into their seat it's

3417.189 --> 3424.779
definitely not into their Moysey all

3421.419 --> 3428.65
right cuz it comes there because we have

3424.779 --> 3431.349
dismissal and red-herring of course it's

3428.65 --> 3435.159
not a rate hearing it yeah yeah it's

3431.349 --> 3437.619
just a blank out of nothing statement no

3435.159 --> 3439.329
it's not the reason you gave for it it

3437.619 --> 3442.659
doesn't even have any logical

3439.329 --> 3445.119
consistency build-up to the conclusion

3442.659 --> 3447.329
so it's just a ridiculous made-up

3445.119 --> 3450.609
statement that doesn't make any sense

3447.329 --> 3452.2490000000003
we're talking about a vanilla did it do

3450.609 --> 3455.259
we know hip for the poets in the world

3452.249 --> 3457.8089999999997
it has nothing to do with the validity

3455.259 --> 3461.229
of your statement this is this is what

3457.809 --> 3464.259
we've been talking about no it's not it

3461.229 --> 3466.359
has nothing to do we for avid ER

3464.259 --> 3469.63
relative density if you're gonna measure

3466.359 --> 3472.779
force in gravity units then you're

3469.63 --> 3475.4990000000003
assuming that gravity is a thing to

3472.779 --> 3478.589
begin with it's just a measurement stick

3475.499 --> 3483.3689999999997
to measure out how much force is applied

3478.589 --> 3486.219
using G as the SB system of measurement

3483.369 --> 3487.7090000000003
units doesn't mean that it is real it

3486.219 --> 3491.14
just means that you use that

3487.709 --> 3493.479
presuppositional system to measure to

3491.14 --> 3495.7889999999998
quantify the amount of force being

3493.479 --> 3499.6299999999997
applied has nothing to do with freaking

3495.789 --> 3501.8190000000004
gravity or density and buoyancy okay

3499.63 --> 3503.2200000000003
well this is forces this is actual

3501.819 --> 3505.45
provable for

3503.22 --> 3509.02
nothing should do with the natural state

3505.45 --> 3511.1099999999997
in the world it does but should we move

3509.02 --> 3518.2
no he does not

3511.11 --> 3524.67
okay it doesn't should we move on to do

3518.2 --> 3524.6699999999996
you know the guy my perspective yeah

3525.63 --> 3537.85
yeah do you know her do you know how

3530.35 --> 3539.5299999999997
helicopters work because he doesn't I'm

3537.85 --> 3541.75
just I'm just asking you can see thinks

3539.53 --> 3543.25
the helicopters should be able to lift

3541.75 --> 3545.89
off the ground and the earth will spin

3543.25 --> 3549.28
under it and then you yeah if the earth

3545.89 --> 3553.24
was spinning definitely and assume

3549.28 --> 3556.2400000000002
unless you're gonna assume that the gas

3553.24 --> 3558.1
of the atmosphere is traveling lockstep

3556.24 --> 3560.1099999999997
with the rotation of the earth in which

3558.1 --> 3562.81
case there would never be a Coriolis

3560.11 --> 3564.4
effect even if you just shot a bullet or

3562.81 --> 3567.0299999999997
anything because everything would be

3564.4 --> 3569.8
moving lockstep with the earth rotation

3567.03 --> 3572.1400000000003
so yeah the Coriolis effect let's not

3569.8 --> 3574.03
get all mingled up with that one in my

3572.14 --> 3576.37
show thank you very much I can do that

3574.03 --> 3578.7900000000004
on the device if you just have 30

3576.37 --> 3581.83
seconds I'll just tell you about how

3578.79 --> 3590.65
that actually works if you've got 30

3581.83 --> 3593.59
seconds just definition of a helicopter

3590.65 --> 3600.82
hovering I'll just explain to you how

3593.59 --> 3603.4300000000003
that works how a helicopter works it's

3600.82 --> 3608.53
engineering it's not relevant to

3603.43 --> 3611.71
anything so it's okay me I don't I want

3608.53 --> 3614.3500000000004
to go there I went very quickly 20

3611.71 --> 3617.7400000000002
seconds if a helicopters hovering on the

3614.35 --> 3619.96
land on a wharf let's say and there's an

3617.74 --> 3621.7299999999996
aircraft carrier going past at 30 knots

3619.96 --> 3623.35
and there's a helicopter staying right

3621.73 --> 3624.06
above the same spot on the aircraft

3623.35 --> 3630.0699999999997
carrier

3624.06 --> 3632.35
what helicopters hovering well

3630.07 --> 3634.9300000000003
helicopters would naturally hover it

3632.35 --> 3637.5099999999998
unless there is a constant wind blowing

3634.93 --> 3640.5699999999997
and then they would need to correct for

3637.51 --> 3643.3300000000004
that slightly and they can still hover

3640.57 --> 3645.13
just at a slight angle as it were as if

3643.33 --> 3645.7
they were traveling to compensate for

3645.13 --> 3649.84
the win

3645.7 --> 3652.21
oh I'll give you the answer the

3649.84 --> 3654.6400000000003
helicopter hovering on the wharf right

3652.21 --> 3658.18
next to the crane not moving an inch and

3654.64 --> 3659.95
the helicopter moving at 55 kilometers

3658.18 --> 3660.73
an hour hovering above the deck of an

3659.95 --> 3663.3999999999996
aircraft carrier

3660.73 --> 3666.28
they're both hovering as they're

3663.4 --> 3668.7400000000002
hovering at a root a hover as a

3666.28 --> 3671.4100000000003
reference point above the surface that

3668.74 --> 3675.22
they are above whether it's moving or

3671.41 --> 3679.0
not right if that's exactly what I just

3675.22 --> 3680.5899999999997
said only more technical no you can say

3679.0 --> 3684.55
they can come to safety for whatever

3680.59 --> 3688.48
wind is going on so you just you just

3684.55 --> 3691.17
said to me that a helicopter my example

3688.48 --> 3694.38
just proved that a helicopter can hover

3691.17 --> 3697.12
next to a helicopter on your flat earth

3694.38 --> 3699.37
mixed to a wharf next to a crane without

3697.12 --> 3702.81
moving can hover on a spinning earth

3699.37 --> 3705.58
right Posada in there both hovering

3702.81 --> 3709.12
because a hover is in reference to a

3705.58 --> 3713.5299999999997
datum or a specific point above the

3709.12 --> 3717.2799999999997
ground that's what a hover is thanks

3713.53 --> 3721.0
thanks for that I know I know what

3717.28 --> 3724.6000000000004
hovering is well then why he is bring up

3721.0 --> 3730.12
that point it's the stupidest thing ever

3724.6 --> 3732.85
you brought it up Jess you learn it on

3730.12 --> 3735.43
about my perspective view and then bring

3732.85 --> 3737.14
out how he supposed to doesn't

3735.43 --> 3738.8799999999997
understand helicopters now you're

3737.14 --> 3740.5299999999997
explaining it to me and you're accusing

3738.88 --> 3743.02
me of bringing it up

3740.53 --> 3745.63
no no no it's yourself check man Owen

3743.02 --> 3748.9
Owen I'm not accusing you I'm just

3745.63 --> 3752.59
saying that my perspective cheerin isms

3748.9 --> 3754.69
brought up Bob knodell at globe Buster's

3752.59 --> 3756.7000000000003
portal up it's not a friggin pilot to

3754.69 --> 3758.86
say this what you know what you know why

3756.7 --> 3761.0499999999997
they do that because they're trying to

3758.86 --> 3763.2400000000002
make a point that's not related even to

3761.05 --> 3766.3300000000004
the technical functions of

3763.24 --> 3768.7599999999998
yeah correction stability correction of

3766.33 --> 3772.24
helicopters it's just about why the

3768.76 --> 3775.0
Coriolis effect is not present naturally

3772.24 --> 3778.75
that's what it's about it

3775.0 --> 3780.97
you're totally angling it wrong you're

3778.75 --> 3783.79
approaching it from a technical like all

3780.97 --> 3785.7999999999997
helicopters are designed to do this but

3783.79 --> 3787.45
that's not a point I want to make

3785.8 --> 3789.67
they're trying to make a point that

3787.45 --> 3793.99
there is no Coriolis effect because then

3789.67 --> 3797.26
things would displace cuz the earth

3793.99 --> 3799.5699999999997
would be turning underneath it I had no

3797.26 --> 3803.8300000000004
idea that they were trying to prove that

3799.57 --> 3805.6600000000003
is a is a NT Coriolis effect then I'm

3803.83 --> 3807.52
pretty sure they they will because

3805.66 --> 3811.1499999999996
that's usually when the helicopter is

3807.52 --> 3812.98
brought up in arguments but I was

3811.15 --> 3816.82
running late dumbest thing I've ever

3812.98 --> 3820.0
heard of I've heard Dumber things coming

3816.82 --> 3829.2000000000003
from you really yeah a lot dumber like

3820.0 --> 3835.81
what what Dumber things of us in truth

3829.2 --> 3838.3199999999997
no and I'm too tired to even it's just

3835.81 --> 3841.44
so embarrassing that you don't even know

3838.32 --> 3845.29
what you do on a daily basis make

3841.44 --> 3847.21
ridiculous statements you just did it

3845.29 --> 3848.56
here on this show you don't even know it

3847.21 --> 3851.619
or you don't remember it I don't know

3848.56 --> 3856.2999999999997
what's going on with you man but it's

3851.619 --> 3859.21
terrible I would recommend you pursue

3856.3 --> 3861.19
another course in your life than doing

3859.21 --> 3864.4
this because you're terrible at it

3861.19 --> 3866.5
and maybe you're getting some kind of

3864.4 --> 3871.15
gratification out of doing it but it's

3866.5 --> 3876.03
just look at yourself man I'm serious

3871.15 --> 3883.69
why are you doing this what why do I

3876.03 --> 3887.71
talk to flat-earthers why are you

3883.69 --> 3889.18
pursuing this why are you yeah bothering

3887.71 --> 3891.82
the flattered if there's getting being

3889.18 --> 3895.0
talky and making an absolute ass out of

3891.82 --> 3897.3900000000003
yourself a lot and not just towards

3895.0 --> 3900.97
flat-earthers but towards everyone

3897.39 --> 3903.94
you come in assess it how much use dro

3900.97 --> 3905.859
and look I'm not so that you are but

3903.94 --> 3907.93
that's exactly how you come across and

3905.859 --> 3910.66
you make a sloppy mess out of things you

3907.93 --> 3912.43
ask questions that barely make any damn

3910.66 --> 3915.8199999999997
sense you draw conclusions that are

3912.43 --> 3919.99
openly broken like it's normal that's

3915.82 --> 3921.94
like it's normal oh I are you doing this

3919.99 --> 3924.1899999999996
why are you continuing doing this you

3921.94 --> 3928.48
just make an absolute fool out of

3924.19 --> 3933.79
yourself when you just said which is

3928.48 --> 3939.03
funk what eliris as I'm you just sit boy

3933.79 --> 3941.95
: and Mike claims to the Flat Earth

3939.03 --> 3947.4
community if you like and you said

3941.95 --> 3951.6699999999996
everyone yeah everyone ballers included

3947.4 --> 3955.3
do you know what you just said then yes

3951.67 --> 3956.65
you and we have everyone hearing you I

3955.3 --> 3958.69
don't think you're gonna have a lot of

3956.65 --> 3959.94
people out always kind of connect you

3958.69 --> 3963.04
really

3959.94 --> 3966.34
Owen you just included the whole world

3963.04 --> 3968.38
and your conversation do you realize

3966.34 --> 3973.51
that do you know what the population in

3968.38 --> 3976.69
the world is or what your guess I don't

3973.51 --> 3978.46
know a lot how is that one thing how is

3976.69 --> 3981.43
that relevant anyone that's gonna watch

3978.46 --> 3984.01
this or you anywhere on any kind of

3981.43 --> 3990.0099999999998
flatter of the related debate or panel

3984.01 --> 3995.26
any woman oh and what you just stated is

3990.01 --> 3997.3900000000003
that you believe the globe the who the

3995.26 --> 3999.28
flatters I'll give it to you you believe

3997.39 --> 4008.73
the population of the Flat Earth let's

3999.28 --> 4011.3590000000004
listen freakin two billion people does

4008.73 --> 4015.27
Maxine know you're making your total

4011.359 --> 4018.33
ridiculous straw man point it's your

4015.27 --> 4020.91
statement just said that you think the

4018.33 --> 4025.41
majority the globe the majority of the

4020.91 --> 4027.39
world Flat Earth whatever this no that's

4025.41 --> 4030.29
not what that said at all that's a

4027.39 --> 4033.95
ridiculous assumption

4030.29 --> 4039.47
it's not I'm talking about their their

4033.95 --> 4042.2
perception of you personally not divided

4039.47 --> 4044.5699999999997
things in flat earthers or non flat

4042.2 --> 4046.18
earthers why are you getting this I'm

4044.57 --> 4050.54
talking about how people are perceiving

4046.18 --> 4052.19
you and what you do don't you know

4050.54 --> 4056.99
you're making yourself look like a

4052.19 --> 4058.9900000000002
complete buffoon every time I alrighty

4056.99 --> 4062.1189999999997
the flatter it is that's there's no

4058.99 --> 4064.7599999999998
everyone everyone that sees you that

4062.119 --> 4068.21
gets some kind of look like who is this

4064.76 --> 4070.369
who's this blabbering drunken idiot that

4068.21 --> 4075.43
just constantly makes himself look like

4070.369 --> 4075.4300000000003
a total idiot just is about to pass out

4075.73 --> 4084.5
yeah that's what people get from that

4081.04 --> 4086.84
from what you're doing why because you

4084.5 --> 4088.97
can't be wrong no because you're a

4086.84 --> 4091.94
blithering idiot and you're constantly

4088.97 --> 4095.66
making nonsensical points and bringing

4091.94 --> 4100.1900000000005
out blatantly obvious almost on fire

4095.66 --> 4104.33
level visual strawman arguments it's

4100.19 --> 4108.65
just terrible none of my I'm not good at

4104.33 --> 4110.299
woman your um at all discs of you one

4108.65 --> 4114.62
more before I go if you don't cut me off

4110.299 --> 4126.259
which you normally do I'll give you a

4114.62 --> 4129.1089999999995
chance to cut me off in a day um why why

4126.259 --> 4135.79
would they why would the government let

4129.109 --> 4138.56
Kim trails the earth blood chemtrails

4135.79 --> 4141.5289999999995
why would government do chemtrails is

4138.56 --> 4143.0
that your question yeah why would they

4141.529 --> 4145.43
let chemtrails they don't they're not

4143.0 --> 4146.96
Kim trouser contrails but why would they

4145.43 --> 4154.1900000000005
let them car they're not contrails

4146.96 --> 4154.67
Trails don't lasts and waver out pretty

4154.19 --> 4157.0689999999995
quickly

4154.67 --> 4159.529
yep you're right the chemtrails so why

4157.069 --> 4163.389
would they let Kim Trails curves on the

4159.529 --> 4167.409000000001
horizon as Kim Charles profuse clothes

4163.389 --> 4169.509
why would they do that Nicholas you can

4167.409 --> 4172.21
look at yourself do you run research I

4169.509 --> 4174.46
do do my own research and I do weather

4172.21 --> 4177.19
reports every day on this show and I

4174.46 --> 4180.25
look around me a lot especially in the

4177.19 --> 4182.5599999999995
sky and you just ignore the King Charles

4180.25 --> 4183.509
the curve on the horizon do you no they

4182.56 --> 4187.35
don't

4183.509 --> 4192.9
what why do they they curve concave

4187.35 --> 4197.05
apparently because yes and then go level

4192.9 --> 4199.21
yeah so they do curve concave wise

4197.05 --> 4201.88
because that is how perspective makes

4199.21 --> 4203.92
that looks makes that look when things

4201.88 --> 4206.7390000000005
you're way above you move into the

4203.92 --> 4209.139
distance you're looking you're like a

4206.739 --> 4216.19
SWAT team that was a good that was a

4209.139 --> 4221.05
good I could take down from the VIX to

4216.19 --> 4224.169999999999
the concave no okay let talking about

4221.05 --> 4227.139
it's the appearance the appearance of it

4224.17 --> 4229.3
how it looks and it looks when

4227.139 --> 4232.0
chemtrails goes into the distant it

4229.3 --> 4234.55
looks like it is curving concave wise

4232.0 --> 4237.719
because of perspective it's actually

4234.55 --> 4240.51
going in a straight line it doesn't go

4237.719 --> 4243.52
over the horizon never does it always

4240.51 --> 4247.119000000001
goes into the distance and then goes

4243.52 --> 4248.889
levels out that's how it looks like our

4247.119 --> 4252.009999999999
trucks are you taiking because from

4248.889 --> 4253.719
where I am at the airplane takes off at

4252.01 --> 4255.9400000000005
a coin stand looks like it's taking off

4253.719 --> 4258.19
like a spicy shuttle goes right I have a

4255.94 --> 4262.33
telephone my head indices down into

4258.19 --> 4264.69
cross-strait well I wonder what drugs

4262.33 --> 4267.909
you're taking or whatever medication

4264.69 --> 4269.619
because I don't I have a very good eyes

4267.909 --> 4271.03
and this is how it always looks this is

4269.619 --> 4274.03
how perspective works

4271.03 --> 4277.69
everyone has ever seen a chem trail or a

4274.03 --> 4282.61
tone to this they never go into a curve

4277.69 --> 4286.78
into the distance no they always go down

4282.61 --> 4288.699
and then even out as they get disappear

4286.78 --> 4292.119
in the horizon because of lack of air

4288.699 --> 4293.389999999999
clarity or behind buildings that are

4292.119 --> 4299.929999999999
closer by

4293.39 --> 4302.780000000001
whatever iya particle be so I've gotta

4299.93 --> 4307.610000000001
round out the show no you're an artist

4302.78 --> 4311.8099999999995
okay um thanks for joining Jess

4307.61 --> 4317.48
it was interesting while it lasted as

4311.81 --> 4324.85
though and yeah I'm just kind of done

4317.48 --> 4330.44
with this for now let's get back right

4324.85 --> 4332.990000000001
hmm so thank you all for coming I hope

4330.44 --> 4336.41
this was an interesting hangout I had a

4332.99 --> 4338.75
couple of silent pauses and yeah I did

4336.41 --> 4343.639999999999
little bit here with jazz barely it

4338.75 --> 4345.5
mainly just shell showed him the cold

4343.64 --> 4347.360000000001
harsh truth but he doesn't seem to

4345.5 --> 4349.7
really respond to it I think this guy is

4347.36 --> 4351.74
perpetually delusional not even

4349.7 --> 4354.47
necessarily in a global way but just in

4351.74 --> 4360.17
it like a permanent cognitive dissonance

4354.47 --> 4362.33
state it's very sad definitely falls

4360.17 --> 4364.3
into the mental illness category of some

4362.33 --> 4371.0
kind but it may be physical in nature

4364.3 --> 4372.83
it's just terrible so yeah please upload

4371.0 --> 4375.77
