40.36 --> 43.39
[Music]

67.32 --> 71.6
good morning

69.52 --> 74.96
welcome to flat earth early bird number

71.6 --> 76.72
1108 i'm your host irwin and before we

74.96 --> 79.03999999999999
start the show please don't forget to

76.72 --> 81.28

79.04 --> 83.36000000000001
and if you haven't already subscribe to

81.28 --> 85.43900000000001

85.439 --> 89.52
normally 1 p.m amsterdam time in the

87.439 --> 92.32
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time and

89.52 --> 95.19999999999999
weekend and please also do support me

92.32 --> 96.72
through the paypal patreon

95.2 --> 98.72
crypto wallet super chat and a

96.72 --> 101.52
membership system join button

98.72 --> 106.399
they'll be much appreciated

101.52 --> 106.399
so yeah starting a little late today

108.96 --> 114.72
because i was out for groceries

112.079 --> 118.55999999999999
beautiful sunny weather

114.72 --> 118.56
there's some clouds this time though

119.439 --> 124.79899999999999
potentially formed by trails as you can

122.079 --> 124.79899999999999
see up there

125.2 --> 129.84
this time they are staying behind

130.8 --> 135.44
and yeah

132.0 --> 136.72
quite so as you can see like

135.44 --> 138.879
yeah

136.72 --> 141.04
yesterday was all clear it stayed all

138.879 --> 143.84
clear all day

141.04 --> 143.84
but today

144.64 --> 150.72
it's trail day apparently

148.8 --> 152.72
all right well there's still plenty of

150.72 --> 155.04
sun coming through and

152.72 --> 159.12
it's been very pleasant even though it

155.04 --> 161.519
is yeah literally freezing now i think

159.12 --> 164.0
probably like one degree celsius or

161.519 --> 168.04
something i'll i'll look it up

164.0 --> 168.04
but yeah there's ice everywhere

170.879 --> 174.959
like puddles are all frozen up

175.68 --> 179.44
so yeah it seems like we're gonna have a

180.08 --> 183.68
maybe

181.68 --> 185.519
snow

183.68 --> 187.92000000000002
we might actually get snow this

185.519 --> 189.519
christmas which is very rare

187.92 --> 191.11999999999998
in the netherlands

189.519 --> 193.92000000000002
and if not it's probably going to be

191.12 --> 197.36
freezing like this

193.92 --> 200.0
hello crockett first in chat

197.36 --> 200.0
good to see you

202.56 --> 210.04
it is wednesday the 22nd

205.92 --> 210.04
of december 2021

213.12 --> 216.31900000000002
just

214.319 --> 217.51899999999998
a little more than a week and it's

216.319 --> 220.51899999999998
already

217.519 --> 220.519
2022.

220.879 --> 228.39999999999998
how this year's rushed by

224.4 --> 228.4
to me that is just yeah

229.92 --> 234.72
but i'm feeling great today

231.84 --> 237.439
kind of like yesterday maybe it's like i

234.72 --> 239.76
kind of needed the freezing or something

237.439 --> 240.4
i don't know what it is

239.76 --> 243.439
but

240.4 --> 246.56
yeah whatever was bothering me in the

243.439 --> 249.35999999999999
last month

246.56 --> 251.84
seems to be kind of like gone now

249.36 --> 253.84
hope it stays that way so yeah maybe

251.84 --> 257.76
maybe that means end of the ancestral

253.84 --> 257.76
winds i'm not entirely sure it's just

260.079 --> 263.68
yeah

261.359 --> 265.35999999999996
different

263.68 --> 266.8
but good

265.36 --> 269.8
uh let's see

266.8 --> 269.8
temperature

270.16 --> 275.04
what is

272.8 --> 277.68
yeah yeah i was right it's one degree

275.04 --> 277.68
fahrenheit

280.84 --> 286.63899999999995
and from friday on it's gonna be minus

284.32 --> 286.639
one

291.68 --> 296.24
looking fresh yeah well i went out for

294.24 --> 298.72
groceries

296.24 --> 301.44
and it was kind of cold

298.72 --> 303.68
but that definitely woke me up

301.44 --> 306.4
i thought i'm gonna do that

303.68 --> 306.40000000000003
so that i can

307.6 --> 311.84000000000003
be part of the flat earth debate

310.24 --> 313.68
completely without going out for

311.84 --> 317.11999999999995
groceries yesterday i kind of missed

313.68 --> 317.12
most of the show because of that

317.28 --> 319.52
so

320.4 --> 323.96
yeah not today

325.6 --> 329.44
right

327.12 --> 332.479
so yeah yesterday's flat earth early

329.44 --> 332.479
bird was great

334.8 --> 338.96000000000004
really happy i think i i watched it all

337.6 --> 341.759
back

338.96 --> 344.0
but it was a really good show

341.759 --> 345.6
i did make a couple of mistakes here and

344.0 --> 346.56
there

345.6 --> 350.08000000000004
but

346.56 --> 350.08
overall i was just very

350.84 --> 355.28
explanatory very mechanical

355.44 --> 358.8
yeah holographic sun

359.36 --> 363.039
it's quite the subject

361.36 --> 367.8
it's quite confusing

363.039 --> 367.8
and yeah i like to deal with it

368.56 --> 372.56
so that's what i did yesterday

370.88 --> 375.6
and we'll see what we're going to be

372.56 --> 375.6
talking about today

375.919 --> 381.44
could potentially go

378.96 --> 384.0
to something similar

381.44 --> 387.28
because i feel strong

384.0 --> 388.72
well rested i ate a lot yesterday by the

387.28 --> 393.31899999999996
way

388.72 --> 393.319
i pretty much had like double dinner

394.479 --> 401.919
but i think that yeah my body was just

397.199 --> 401.91900000000004
like okay it's the time to like stock up

402.4 --> 406.15999999999997
and yeah i think i've already pretty

404.08 --> 409.71999999999997
much got enough food for most of

406.16 --> 409.72
christmas now

414.08 --> 421.0
i'm looking forward to going to my dad

416.319 --> 421.0
already communicated with him about it

435.28 --> 439.44
still

436.88 --> 442.08
gonna stick to no coffee in the morning

439.44 --> 442.08
for a while

446.08 --> 449.31899999999996
and minty

450.96 --> 454.71999999999997
so where's everybody

463.28 --> 466.63899999999995
is it just you crockett no there's 10

465.52 --> 469.039
watching

466.639 --> 469.039
11.

476.16 --> 479.16
right

481.12 --> 486.56
uh

482.319 --> 486.56
let's see what happened yesterday

487.28 --> 491.08
yeah flattered bait

492.4 --> 497.19899999999996
but yeah mostly just spent listening to

494.96 --> 498.79999999999995
it also when i came back i was like

497.199 --> 500.96000000000004
really tired

498.8 --> 502.879
and nathan shut down the room like

500.96 --> 505.599
immediately after the after show

502.879 --> 508.96000000000004
recording was over so

505.599 --> 510.87899999999996
yeah that was weird

508.96 --> 512.88
like we're just about to start up a

510.879 --> 515.519
conversation

512.88 --> 516.719
and then blink it's gone

515.519 --> 518.8
anyway

516.719 --> 521.839
uh

518.8 --> 525.88
yeah kiwi life was also there i just

521.839 --> 525.8800000000001
kind of hang around in chat

534.32 --> 539.9590000000001
hey mike seduc

536.399 --> 539.959
good to see you

566.64 --> 572.76
so yeah what do you guys have been what

568.64 --> 572.76
have you guys been up to

584.16 --> 587.16
hmm

590.08 --> 592.399
right

593.04 --> 597.92
yeah

594.72 --> 599.9200000000001
i've been dreaming more

597.92 --> 601.04
very dreamy

599.92 --> 604.36
last

601.04 --> 604.36
few days

605.2 --> 611.32
so constantly just

607.6 --> 611.32
dreaming about women

624.0 --> 629.8
hello wrath snowbirds good to see you

634.24 --> 637.24
hmm

673.04 --> 676.64
oh and yeah when i was listening back

674.959 --> 681.5189999999999
yesterday show us

676.64 --> 684.0
shocked as to how accurate my you knew

681.519 --> 686.72
really was it's just that the scratchy

684.0 --> 686.72
part of uh

687.519 --> 691.839
jim bob's reenactment of

689.92 --> 693.279
peterson

691.839 --> 695.2
is like

693.279 --> 698.32
but i actually did train it for a bit

695.2 --> 698.32
and it's really tough

700.079 --> 704.2399999999999
hey tony whitcomb what's up

704.959 --> 708.4799999999999
good afternoon for me

724.8 --> 731.0
gas pressure based on a weight of

727.279 --> 731.0
mercury what

734.48 --> 738.12
how does that work

758.32 --> 762.88
what are you getting at from wrath never

760.32 --> 762.88
heard of that

765.44 --> 773.839
atmospheric pressure is determined

769.519 --> 773.839
by the weight of mercury what

775.04 --> 778.639
you mean how it's derived

784.24 --> 790.16
look into it you mean just

787.279 --> 791.279
barometric

790.16 --> 794.279
systems

791.279 --> 794.279
right

804.399 --> 810.0
a presuppose no not really

807.2 --> 814.279
it's just a derived

810.0 --> 814.279
pressure it's mechanical

828.48 --> 833.12
it's kind of weird though like

830.72 --> 835.36
how would the

833.12 --> 835.36
like

835.6 --> 840.88
i guess that

836.88 --> 843.519
unlike water except for when it's frozen

840.88 --> 845.68
it's like incompatible that mercury does

843.519 --> 847.68
kind of expand when it gets hotter and

845.68 --> 851.04
all that

847.68 --> 853.76
i mean it's used in thermometers

851.04 --> 856.16
because it does actually expand

853.76 --> 859.6
right that's the point

856.16 --> 863.12
so i guess that you can also use that to

859.6 --> 863.12
kind of determine the pressure

865.6 --> 869.0
of the air

883.279 --> 886.959
no carrots on fire

888.24 --> 892.24
no it's just

889.839 --> 895.6800000000001
pressure differential

892.24 --> 898.88
if anything there's no weight

895.68 --> 902.0
there's no use saying oh there's air

898.88 --> 903.4399999999999
pressing on top of it because of weights

902.0 --> 905.44
because of gravity that's all

903.44 --> 909.0790000000001
presupposed nonsense it doesn't get

905.44 --> 909.0790000000001
involved at all

912.56 --> 915.3599999999999
hello again

920.0 --> 927.839
hello skeptic 936.

923.04 --> 927.8389999999999
i said 939 yesterday for some reason

969.36 --> 973.5600000000001
you answer to either okay

984.639 --> 987.639
okay

1011.44 --> 1014.24
it's a bit weird though

1013.279 --> 1016.72
so

1014.24 --> 1019.12
the mercury

1016.72 --> 1021.9200000000001
like does that mean it's directly

1019.12 --> 1021.92
exposed

1022.88 --> 1026.319
to the air right

1028.4 --> 1032.5590000000002
or is it in some kind of a flexible

1031.28 --> 1034.3999999999999
container

1032.559 --> 1036.799
because mercury

1034.4 --> 1039.799
like out in the open that's not very

1036.799 --> 1039.799
healthy

1040.72 --> 1044.959
like i mean it can actually evaporate

1043.36 --> 1049.6399999999999
and all that

1044.959 --> 1049.64
over time it's quite toxic

1052.32 --> 1059.559
yeah makes me want to look it up

1054.96 --> 1059.559
what does the device like that look like

1078.96 --> 1083.4
okay it's not closed off

1106.64 --> 1112.72
but i guess that you could just use it

1109.679 --> 1116.6000000000001
for both temperature indication and for

1112.72 --> 1116.6000000000001
pressure it makes sense

1129.84 --> 1135.32
is there no iv they can manipulate what

1176.16 --> 1180.16
okay don't know where that i don't

1178.799 --> 1182.32
fully

1180.16 --> 1184.48
understand the context of all that wrath

1182.32 --> 1184.48
but

1185.44 --> 1190.799
right look it doesn't really matter

1188.0 --> 1192.799
whether even google searches say oh it's

1190.799 --> 1194.96
used to measure atmospheric crash it's

1192.799 --> 1197.76
just the insertion

1194.96 --> 1197.76
atmospheric

1197.919 --> 1204.88
right it's just gas pressure the average

1200.799 --> 1206.6399999999999
gas pressure and i guess that it is

1204.88 --> 1208.96
well

1206.64 --> 1211.44
it's

1208.96 --> 1213.8400000000001
influenceable by pressure

1211.44 --> 1215.2
it's compressible i guess

1213.84 --> 1217.6789999999999
and it's

1215.2 --> 1219.52
heavily influenceable by temperature but

1217.679 --> 1221.919
yeah since temperature already

1219.52 --> 1223.679
influences gas pressure i guess that you

1221.919 --> 1226.24
could both calibrate it

1223.679 --> 1229.2800000000002
to measure just temperature

1226.24 --> 1230.72
or set it to measure the pressure

1229.28 --> 1235.84
both

1230.72 --> 1235.84
but not with like the same thing i guess

1238.0 --> 1243.44
not with the same mercury compartment

1241.52 --> 1246.1589999999999
i'm not entirely sure but

1243.44 --> 1249.159
it's seems like it's the both the same

1246.159 --> 1249.159
system

1265.44 --> 1269.3600000000001
gas doesn't expand it what

1268.559 --> 1272.08
no

1269.36 --> 1272.08
no it does

1272.559 --> 1275.28
it doesn't mean that it's all going to

1274.4 --> 1278.4
be

1275.28 --> 1282.6399999999999
pressure all equal pressure everywhere

1278.4 --> 1282.64
but it will expand in all directions

1283.039 --> 1287.36
until it finds well the pressure

1284.96 --> 1289.039
equilibrium and then depending on the

1287.36 --> 1291.1999999999998
circumstances

1289.039 --> 1294.799
gradiations may form

1291.2 --> 1294.799
con yeah persistently

1294.88 --> 1297.0390000000002
but

1296.0 --> 1299.52
yeah

1297.039 --> 1301.919
that's a secondary effect it already

1299.52 --> 1306.1589999999999
expanded in all directions if if it

1301.919 --> 1306.159
hadn't it can't even form a gradient

1315.52 --> 1318.799
normal dave i don't know what the hell

1317.28 --> 1321.52
you're blabbering about but this is

1318.799 --> 1321.52
ridiculous

1331.12 --> 1335.84
columns are you really like are you a

1334.0 --> 1338.08
baller or something are you trying to

1335.84 --> 1340.24
like draw on these ridiculous anti-flat

1338.08 --> 1343.36
earther machinations

1340.24 --> 1347.24
the column of air

1343.36 --> 1347.24
there's no such thing

1351.12 --> 1354.8799999999999
the air doesn't separate into columns it

1353.28 --> 1358.6789999999999
doesn't behave like columns it doesn't

1354.88 --> 1358.679
have weight like columns

1361.44 --> 1365.8400000000001
it just has pressure in all directions

1364.08 --> 1366.72
and then

1365.84 --> 1369.1999999999998
yeah

1366.72 --> 1372.08
other influences can cause the pressure

1369.2 --> 1376.32
division to rearrange

1372.08 --> 1376.32
it yeah resulting in gradation

1377.76 --> 1382.1589999999999
no it doesn't have weight i explained

1380.0 --> 1384.08
this yesterday to no end i'm not gonna

1382.159 --> 1387.3200000000002
go through all that again air does not

1384.08 --> 1387.32
have weight

1390.159 --> 1395.2
can't have weight because weight is air

1392.88 --> 1395.2
weight

1395.52 --> 1403.9189999999999
air doesn't have a differential with air

1400.32 --> 1407.36
unless it is unnaturally pressurized

1403.919 --> 1407.3600000000001
in a separate container

1408.48 --> 1413.3600000000001
because then there will be a

1409.919 --> 1414.7990000000002
differential between that particular air

1413.36 --> 1417.12
pressure

1414.799 --> 1418.559
and the rest of the normal

1417.12 --> 1422.12
air pressure

1418.559 --> 1422.12
at ground level

1438.88 --> 1447.5200000000002
is the gas in my room expanding yeah

1444.4 --> 1450.0
or rather it has expanded it's all

1447.52 --> 1451.6
sitting there having been expanded in

1450.0 --> 1455.039
all directions

1451.6 --> 1457.279
and it kind of just moves around

1455.039 --> 1460.64
like every part of it moves in all

1457.279 --> 1462.72
directions all the time

1460.64 --> 1464.24
but since there's no direct pressure

1462.72 --> 1466.08
differentials there's not going to be

1464.24 --> 1471.2
wind because that requires pressure

1466.08 --> 1474.3999999999999
differentials but effectively every gas

1471.2 --> 1478.159
is moving in all directions all the time

1474.4 --> 1478.159
like all directions all the time

1478.4 --> 1484.64
that's what the well that's what the

1480.4 --> 1484.64
model of the gas particles do

1485.6 --> 1492.559
but you don't necessarily even feel that

1487.76 --> 1495.52
you just feel the overall pressure of it

1492.559 --> 1495.52
the gas pressure

1497.44 --> 1500.64
right yeah you don't even feel look if

1499.44 --> 1502.48
there's stable pressure you don't

1500.64 --> 1504.159
effectively feel it you start to feel it

1502.48 --> 1507.279
when there's differences that's when you

1504.159 --> 1509.0390000000002
feel it like hey it's different

1507.279 --> 1512.159
my body has to adapt to the different

1509.039 --> 1512.1589999999999
pressure that's what you feel

1513.12 --> 1517.4399999999998
once it this pressure is relatively

1515.12 --> 1521.12
stable you just

1517.44 --> 1521.1200000000001
don't really pick up on it anymore

1523.2 --> 1529.919
air is heavier than empty space

1526.84 --> 1529.9189999999999
that's ugh

1532.559 --> 1536.08
yeah

1533.36 --> 1539.279
sure air

1536.08 --> 1541.1999999999998
in a tanker whatever weight in a vacuum

1539.279 --> 1544.24
is gonna weigh something because yeah

1541.2 --> 1547.1200000000001
the medium is a vacuum

1544.24 --> 1551.88
but that weight will not correlate with

1547.12 --> 1551.8799999999999
regular weight which is air weight

1567.44 --> 1573.3600000000001
right so just to point it out every time

1570.72 --> 1575.1200000000001
somebody says anybody says air has

1573.36 --> 1578.0
weight

1575.12 --> 1580.08
it's probably a baller

1578.0 --> 1582.96
because they want to

1580.08 --> 1586.559
interpret that meaning of weight as if

1582.96 --> 1588.799
it is subjected to gravity

1586.559 --> 1590.8799999999999
that's what they want

1588.799 --> 1592.799
even though that's not what weight

1590.88 --> 1594.0800000000002
really is weight is just relative

1592.799 --> 1595.9189999999999
density

1594.08 --> 1597.52
this equilibrium

1595.919 --> 1602.0
pressure

1597.52 --> 1602.0
in a medium of air that's weight

1610.88 --> 1615.44
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

1613.12 --> 1615.4399999999998
wrath

1621.279 --> 1626.12
gasps pressure guess that's the [ __ ]

1635.279 --> 1639.84
dude what have you been

1637.12 --> 1641.52
watching or smoking

1639.84 --> 1644.52
i'm not following what you're talking

1641.52 --> 1644.52
about

1667.84 --> 1669.9189999999999
you

1688.32 --> 1693.36
yeah tony whitcomb me too i dude i don't

1691.2 --> 1696.919
know like wrath like what the [ __ ] are

1693.36 --> 1696.9189999999999
you talking about

1722.799 --> 1728.48
the heirs around us is governed by

1725.52 --> 1730.799
static charge

1728.48 --> 1730.799
what

1730.96 --> 1735.52
pressure is in effect what the [ __ ] are

1733.679 --> 1738.52
you talking about

1735.52 --> 1738.52
what

1740.0 --> 1746.399
are you actually attributing

1743.2 --> 1747.6000000000001
pressure from gases to something

1746.399 --> 1751.559
electric

1747.6 --> 1751.559
can't be serious man

1754.399 --> 1761.76
like no no it's just gas pressure

1758.159 --> 1764.72
it's a pressure unique to gas

1761.76 --> 1767.52
to matter in the gaseous state

1764.72 --> 1769.76
it causes a pressure yeah yeah you can

1767.52 --> 1772.559
translate that pressure into something

1769.76 --> 1775.039
that is comparable to weight

1772.559 --> 1777.36
yeah the pounds or whatever

1775.039 --> 1778.84
it's still just gas pressure it's very

1777.36 --> 1783.36
different from

1778.84 --> 1785.52
regular pressure from this equilibrium

1783.36 --> 1787.76
from relative density this equilibrium

1785.52 --> 1791.559
right which is also

1787.76 --> 1791.559
measured through pressure

1800.88 --> 1808.3200000000002
hurricanes are fueled by the same no

1805.2 --> 1810.3990000000001
no no they aren't

1808.32 --> 1812.1589999999999
electrics have very little to do with

1810.399 --> 1816.08
that

1812.159 --> 1816.0800000000002
like electrics don't cause

1816.159 --> 1819.1200000000001
like hurricanes

1820.08 --> 1824.799
that's really bizarre

1822.24 --> 1827.2
like a hurricane is in effect it's a

1824.799 --> 1830.0
direct side effect

1827.2 --> 1832.88
the clashing of two

1830.0 --> 1832.88
weather fronts

1835.039 --> 1841.2
and then it's basically a turbulence

1837.84 --> 1843.12
aerodynamic effect like how it all mixes

1841.2 --> 1845.6000000000001
in how the flow

1843.12 --> 1847.36
of two different fronts

1845.6 --> 1849.12
influence one another that's what

1847.36 --> 1852.0
creates the hurricane has nothing to do

1849.12 --> 1852.0
with electrics

1854.64 --> 1860.7990000000002
right electrics come

1856.96 --> 1863.6000000000001
out of it like storms as a side effect

1860.799 --> 1868.0
the electrics don't cause the storm the

1863.6 --> 1868.0
storm causes the electrics come on

1869.36 --> 1873.24
hey jeff guess it

1882.32 --> 1887.6
yeah friction creates the electricity

1885.519 --> 1890.559
not the other way around

1887.6 --> 1891.519
electricity doesn't cause the storm

1890.559 --> 1894.24
storm

1891.519 --> 1895.44
causes air to move past

1894.24 --> 1900.0
each other

1895.44 --> 1900.0
past objects it might create friction

1900.48 --> 1905.3600000000001
and that might create electricity like

1902.64 --> 1908.3200000000002
lightning and all that

1905.36 --> 1909.76
it's not the other way around

1908.32 --> 1912.559
the lightning

1909.76 --> 1915.039
doesn't cause electricity which doesn't

1912.559 --> 1916.399
cause friction which doesn't cause the

1915.039 --> 1921.0
storm

1916.399 --> 1921.0
that's a really weird thing to assert

1952.96 --> 1955.2
no

1956.799 --> 1962.1589999999999
no it isn't

1959.279 --> 1965.36
dude have you been like watching ken

1962.159 --> 1970.48
wheeler crap or something

1965.36 --> 1970.4799999999998
bob no dell not like this is ridiculous

1971.039 --> 1975.44
i'm getting offended by this [ __ ] like

1973.6 --> 1978.24
this is ridiculous what you're saying

1975.44 --> 1978.24
wrath it is

1978.96 --> 1985.279
electricity does not cause

1982.399 --> 1985.279
air pressure

1987.679 --> 1991.679
right

1988.559 --> 1993.279
like a lightning strike at best

1991.679 --> 1995.039
might cause a

1993.279 --> 1996.159
temporary

1995.039 --> 1998.279
pressure

1996.159 --> 2000.0800000000002
because it is basically well

1998.279 --> 2003.679
electrifying

2000.08 --> 2005.6789999999999
gas which then kind of explodes in a

2003.679 --> 2009.1200000000001
turning into plasma which then gives all

2005.679 --> 2011.919
the lighter etc and that yeah that

2009.12 --> 2014.0
thunder strike sound

2011.919 --> 2016.159
that's basically a slight pressure if

2014.0 --> 2018.32
it's a shock wave because of the sudden

2016.159 --> 2020.24
pressure

2018.32 --> 2024.08
of the like that the lightning causes in

2020.24 --> 2024.08
the gas through which it goes

2024.88 --> 2029.519
right

2026.08 --> 2031.84
but that's just the thunder strike

2029.519 --> 2034.88
it doesn't like push

2031.84 --> 2037.8799999999999
things around gradually that's not what

2034.88 --> 2037.88
happens

2059.119 --> 2061.839
hello jose

2062.639 --> 2066.8
no worse than saying the earth has no

2064.639 --> 2069.04
weight excuse me did i say anything like

2066.8 --> 2069.04
that

2070.48 --> 2073.04
earth dirt

2072.079 --> 2075.04
rock

2073.04 --> 2076.48
yeah it does have weight you know what

2075.04 --> 2078.96
weight is

2076.48 --> 2081.52
it's air weight it's relative density

2078.96 --> 2084.32
this equilibrium pressure

2081.52 --> 2087.44
that you can measure

2084.32 --> 2087.44
yeah through a scale

2087.599 --> 2094.56
and that works great with earth

2090.639 --> 2096.8
because it is denser than the gas

2094.56 --> 2098.48
that typically surrounds it when you

2096.8 --> 2100.8
weigh it

2098.48 --> 2103.52
it's a pretty stable relation the

2100.8 --> 2105.3590000000004
densities giving a pretty stable amount

2103.52 --> 2106.32
of pressure and that's yeah that's

2105.359 --> 2110.5989999999997
weight

2106.32 --> 2110.599
never said it doesn't have weight

2117.119 --> 2122.0
to learn it from cleary

2120.16 --> 2126.1189999999997
jesus i don't know what clear he's been

2122.0 --> 2126.119
up to man but that's ridiculous

2142.32 --> 2145.32
uh

2152.56 --> 2158.599
oh meant to say air oh so you're just

2154.72 --> 2158.5989999999997
gonna be a troll then

2166.16 --> 2171.2
yeah i've already addressed it i don't

2168.4 --> 2174.0
want to be spending this entire show

2171.2 --> 2176.3999999999996
just listening to whiny trolls

2174.0 --> 2180.079
that are gonna just chant the same [ __ ]

2176.4 --> 2180.079
over and over again not listen

2183.2 --> 2190.64
yeah wait is a convention

2185.839 --> 2193.599
it it's not a thing right a a real thing

2190.64 --> 2196.1189999999997
it's a derived measurement

2193.599 --> 2198.8
what it's based on is relative density

2196.119 --> 2201.6800000000003
disequilibrium pressure in

2198.8 --> 2204.1600000000003
in a medium of air

2201.68 --> 2206.56
that's what it is

2204.16 --> 2210.96
it's a convention

2206.56 --> 2215.64
it's not a natural system

2210.96 --> 2215.64
because it's different right

2216.16 --> 2219.68
you can't weigh

2218.64 --> 2222.3199999999997
things

2219.68 --> 2224.3999999999996
that are actually less dense than air

2222.32 --> 2227.52
you can't weigh that

2224.4 --> 2227.52
it doesn't register

2227.68 --> 2232.24
it doesn't correlate with like atomic

2230.16 --> 2233.52
weight

2232.24 --> 2238.0789999999997
which yeah

2233.52 --> 2238.079
it's kind of a weird concept by itself

2240.32 --> 2245.599
there did these nonsense well you're

2242.32 --> 2247.839
banned it's scientific fact

2245.599 --> 2250.4
i will not tolerate

2247.839 --> 2252.44
[ __ ] that are gonna just die

2250.4 --> 2254.7200000000003
directly deny

2252.44 --> 2256.2400000000002
demonstrable scientific evidence

2254.72 --> 2259.359
evidence-based

2256.24 --> 2262.0789999999997
systems yeah that have literally been

2259.359 --> 2264.0789999999997
demonstrated to no end with video

2262.079 --> 2266.1600000000003
examples and everything by multiple

2264.079 --> 2268.4
people to be real if you're gonna say

2266.16 --> 2271.5989999999997
it's nonsense you're out of here

2268.4 --> 2274.8
get the [ __ ] out

2271.599 --> 2275.839
not gonna have actual signs denying

2274.8 --> 2279.76
right

2275.839 --> 2281.2
do not tolerate actual signs deniers

2279.76 --> 2284.1600000000003
you understand

2281.2 --> 2287.839
that's not your narrative bald heart

2284.16 --> 2293.04
[ __ ] story science it's actual

2287.839 --> 2293.04
empirical experimentation based science

2296.96 --> 2300.599
hello m appeal

2320.0 --> 2326.0
the water at rest is horizontal yeah

2325.2 --> 2329.52
on

2326.0 --> 2331.839
an even altitude of presupposed

2329.52 --> 2331.839
what

2332.839 --> 2338.96
hydrostatic at equilibrium you mean the

2335.76 --> 2341.2000000000003
excuse that ballers give as to how it

2338.96 --> 2343.92
all sits equally yeah yeah they give it

2341.2 --> 2347.04
nice names it's very easy

2343.92 --> 2348.2400000000002
it really to me still it's super easy to

2347.04 --> 2350.96
imagine

2348.24 --> 2354.0
how it can all equally sit on a ball

2350.96 --> 2356.0
yeah i know it is ridiculous i've been

2354.0 --> 2357.839
very much trained into thinking like

2356.0 --> 2359.68
that it's like yeah you just bend

2357.839 --> 2361.52
everything in a ball it's very simple

2359.68 --> 2363.44
everything you see you just bend it in

2361.52 --> 2365.599
the ball it can work because i can

2363.44 --> 2367.599
imagine it to work

2365.599 --> 2369.599
it's not a ball though

2367.599 --> 2372.32
so it's completely pointless to

2369.599 --> 2375.2000000000003
entertain any of that

2372.32 --> 2376.8
right it's even more pointless than to

2375.2 --> 2378.56
entertain on

2376.8 --> 2382.079
what

2378.56 --> 2383.92
an iss would be designed like

2382.079 --> 2386.4
which i actually take kind of serious

2383.92 --> 2389.359
because it is the well the design

2386.4 --> 2391.6800000000003
functionality of a device i find that

2389.359 --> 2393.52
much more interesting

2391.68 --> 2396.16
then oh i'm gonna

2393.52 --> 2397.119
figure out how the physics would work on

2396.16 --> 2399.92
the ball

2397.119 --> 2399.92
which it isn't

2401.359 --> 2405.68
so why why would i do that

2407.599 --> 2411.839
right

2408.96 --> 2415.359
space station in a vacuum

2411.839 --> 2418.0
without relative density making it go in

2415.359 --> 2419.5989999999997
a direction in relation to the medium it

2418.0 --> 2422.0
is in

2419.599 --> 2424.48
now that's an interesting fictional

2422.0 --> 2428.319
medium to think like okay how would you

2424.48 --> 2428.319
design a device in this

2430.88 --> 2434.48
that sort of thing i do think is

2432.48 --> 2436.16
interesting because that's just science

2434.48 --> 2439.2
fiction

2436.16 --> 2441.1189999999997
but to imagine what the earth must be

2439.2 --> 2445.1189999999997
like if it was a ball

2441.119 --> 2445.119
no that's that's kind of stupid

2445.28 --> 2450.6400000000003
except maybe when i'm baldwin and um

2448.24 --> 2452.8799999999997
have to counter some impossible

2450.64 --> 2454.96
flattered argument

2452.88 --> 2457.2000000000003
and with impossible i mean impossible to

2454.96 --> 2460.2400000000002
counter and i'm like yeah but i can do

2457.2 --> 2463.1189999999997
it anyway because i can do it

2460.24 --> 2463.1189999999997
because i want to

2464.0 --> 2467.76
i mean it's not going to make any

2465.44 --> 2469.839
legitimate sense but it's gonna be make

2467.76 --> 2471.76
more sense than the average [ __ ]

2469.839 --> 2474.48
excuse any baller out there is gonna

2471.76 --> 2476.1600000000003
make because they're just not very good

2474.48 --> 2477.359
at what they do

2476.16 --> 2480.24
i am

2477.359 --> 2482.4
i'm very good at ball machinations very

2480.24 --> 2484.4799999999996
very very good

2482.4 --> 2487.76
not mathematically right i'm not

2484.48 --> 2490.56
concerned with trying to hide

2487.76 --> 2492.88
details and and you use like

2490.56 --> 2494.56
switcheroo tricks to kind of fool people

2492.88 --> 2495.52
into not picking up on the missing

2494.56 --> 2497.839
detail

2495.52 --> 2500.64
any sort of thing concerning that i just

2497.839 --> 2502.7999999999997
do it fully automatically i i don't even

2500.64 --> 2504.48
notice when i do that

2502.8 --> 2506.8390000000004
when i'm acting like ballwood i

2504.48 --> 2509.599
literally don't notice it's fully

2506.839 --> 2511.92
automated my consciousness is not

2509.599 --> 2514.4
puzzling anything it's not even making

2511.92 --> 2517.2000000000003
choices it's just fully automated it's

2514.4 --> 2517.2000000000003
very easy

2521.359 --> 2524.24
but it's just

2524.88 --> 2529.2000000000003
why would i want to imagine oh how is

2527.359 --> 2531.68
the earth ball oh and i'm just going to

2529.2 --> 2534.0
imagine oh that could work

2531.68 --> 2537.04
no it can't work nothing about the ball

2534.0 --> 2538.88
really works it's completely pointless

2537.04 --> 2541.2799999999997
like it's pointless to even try to

2538.88 --> 2544.079
figure out how it would work

2541.28 --> 2545.92
because there is no way to even simulate

2544.079 --> 2548.6400000000003
it

2545.92 --> 2551.6800000000003
to make it work like literally guys

2548.64 --> 2552.96
literally i'm very convinced at this

2551.68 --> 2554.16
point

2552.96 --> 2556.88
that

2554.16 --> 2559.04
this physical simulation which it

2556.88 --> 2564.079
arguably is

2559.04 --> 2567.119
could never in any arrangement in any

2564.079 --> 2570.1600000000003
sort of rearrangement of everything in

2567.119 --> 2571.839
this setting it could never be a ball in

2570.16 --> 2572.72
outer space

2571.839 --> 2576.0789999999997
like

2572.72 --> 2577.5989999999997
that is simply never possible beyond the

2576.079 --> 2579.599
imagination

2577.599 --> 2580.56
there is no way

2579.599 --> 2584.0
to

2580.56 --> 2586.48
to redefine the workings of matter

2584.0 --> 2589.44
by god through simulation through

2586.48 --> 2592.0
structural simulation to accomplish that

2589.44 --> 2595.119
it's just not possible it's never gonna

2592.0 --> 2596.88
be possible no matter what

2595.119 --> 2598.1600000000003
even if the freaking

2596.88 --> 2599.119
universe

2598.16 --> 2603.1189999999997
if

2599.119 --> 2605.52
the realm ended was like de-resoluted

2603.119 --> 2608.0
it's over the rest of it's over like no

2605.52 --> 2609.7599999999998
more realm it literally doesn't exist

2608.0 --> 2612.4
anymore and god's gonna be like okay

2609.76 --> 2614.48
let's do it again oh everybody wants it

2612.4 --> 2616.56
to be a ball

2614.48 --> 2619.119
that's impossible

2616.56 --> 2622.24
like god can't make the earth into a

2619.119 --> 2626.599
ball even if he wanted to you get it

2622.24 --> 2626.5989999999997
it's not a ball

2637.04 --> 2640.04
ah

2660.24 --> 2663.839
hey ask your receive

2670.88 --> 2676.079
citation for us why why would i need to

2673.76 --> 2678.599
do that oh you need some official

2676.079 --> 2680.319
registry for something that is

2678.599 --> 2682.88
demonstrable

2680.319 --> 2685.359
that can literally be demonstrated every

2682.88 --> 2687.52
single time and yeah you can pile on

2685.359 --> 2690.88
with a thousand

2687.52 --> 2693.52
slaughter worthy gamma pieces of [ __ ]

2690.88 --> 2695.6800000000003
and start whining all day and bullying

2693.52 --> 2698.64
and threatening hey you just asked me

2695.68 --> 2700.3999999999996
his name real yeah like

2698.64 --> 2702.7999999999997
like sleeping warrior gets who's

2700.4 --> 2705.04
actually done the effort to

2702.8 --> 2708.079
make physical proof

2705.04 --> 2711.599
to actually do an experiment

2708.079 --> 2715.8390000000004
write it all down ever show every part

2711.599 --> 2717.3590000000004
multiple times yeah that's my citation

2715.839 --> 2719.52
because it's actually

2717.359 --> 2722.4
physically demonstrated it's not just

2719.52 --> 2723.7599999999998
some blabbering scientist supposed

2722.4 --> 2725.92
scientist

2723.76 --> 2728.2400000000002
with all these degrees that's declaring

2725.92 --> 2730.48
that

2728.24 --> 2732.8799999999997
it wouldn't even matter like what the

2730.48 --> 2735.44
who gives a [ __ ] if some

2732.88 --> 2738.319
person with a piece of paper

2735.44 --> 2740.56
and mechanical insight is gonna say

2738.319 --> 2743.52
something who gives a [ __ ]

2740.56 --> 2746.64
when there's actual on-screen

2743.52 --> 2749.2
repeatable demonstrations

2746.64 --> 2752.0
who gives a [ __ ] for a citation when

2749.2 --> 2753.2799999999997
there's actual physical demonstrations

2752.0 --> 2756.48
right there

2753.28 --> 2756.48
and you can do them too

2757.92 --> 2764.16
can't god do anything he wants no no he

2761.76 --> 2764.1600000000003
can't

2764.64 --> 2767.7599999999998
he's a designer

2770.319 --> 2774.8
design

2771.44 --> 2778.079
has to abide by logic

2774.8 --> 2781.599
by structural logic

2778.079 --> 2787.2400000000002
this is not some fantasy [ __ ]

2781.599 --> 2787.2400000000002
it's all way too structurally integrated

2788.24 --> 2796.9599999999996
things work the way they do because of

2791.44 --> 2796.96
this structural nature of reality itself

2797.68 --> 2804.24
you can't rearrange how the structural

2801.2 --> 2806.16
pathways of things in reality work they

2804.24 --> 2807.839
work the way they work

2806.16 --> 2809.1189999999997
that cannot change

2807.839 --> 2811.2799999999997
right you can't

2809.119 --> 2813.599
rearrange

2811.28 --> 2816.0
the content

2813.599 --> 2820.2400000000002
scoop it around or whatever it's you

2816.0 --> 2821.359
can't make gas stick to a ball versus a

2820.24 --> 2823.68
giant

2821.359 --> 2827.92
room of emptiness

2823.68 --> 2830.7999999999997
you just can't do that god can't do that

2827.92 --> 2834.7200000000003
nothing can do that only your [ __ ]

2830.8 --> 2834.7200000000003
imagination can do that

2838.88 --> 2845.4
god makes logic so he can change it no

2842.079 --> 2845.4
he can't

2850.17 --> 2853.239
[Music]

2857.52 --> 2862.83
no

2859.72 --> 2862.83
[Music]

2865.28 --> 2870.8390000000004
cannot change

2867.52 --> 2873.2
right that would literally give a

2870.839 --> 2877.44
syntax error

2873.2 --> 2879.2799999999997
in the simulation literally

2877.44 --> 2883.2000000000003
it can't work

2879.28 --> 2886.48
things that can't work can't work

2883.2 --> 2889.85
doesn't matter who tries to make it work

2886.48 --> 2892.96
if it can't work it can

2889.85 --> 2892.96
[Music]

2895.359 --> 2901.0789999999997
powerful good

2897.96 --> 2901.079
[Music]

2903.76 --> 2908.659
could

2905.56 --> 2908.659
[Music]

2911.2 --> 2915.839
can simply

2912.48 --> 2915.839
never work

2931.04 --> 2935.52
sorry m appeal i'm mostly responding to

2937.359 --> 2942.2
some crazy assertions here in chat

2948.88 --> 2954.319
you're pushing it by saying yeah but

2951.52 --> 2959.44
it's logic

2954.319 --> 2962.5589999999997
god made the rules right he laid it out

2959.44 --> 2962.559
that can't change

2965.28 --> 2969.2000000000003
things working the way they do can't

2967.44 --> 2972.0
change

2969.2 --> 2974.3999999999996
unless you start to like totally [ __ ]

2972.0 --> 2977.359
around with the simulation and guess

2974.4 --> 2979.44
what syntax error

2977.359 --> 2981.92
you can't make

2979.44 --> 2981.92
something

2982.72 --> 2988.7999999999997
that's just impossible to make

2986.64 --> 2991.44
nothing can do that

2988.8 --> 2993.8390000000004
if it is physically impossible then it

2991.44 --> 2993.839
can't

2996.839 --> 3003.7599999999998
be doesn't mean that

2999.599 --> 3003.76
yeah a lot of things can be

3004.319 --> 3008.92
right some things just can't

3016.24 --> 3020.8799999999997
right

3017.2 --> 3022.96
like yeah sodom and gomorrah can never

3020.88 --> 3025.599
be like heaven

3022.96 --> 3027.44
just can't it can never be like that

3025.599 --> 3029.04
it's not one of those things oh you want

3027.44 --> 3032.0
it to be

3029.04 --> 3034.319
no we just in our heads redefine it yeah

3032.0 --> 3036.64
well it's still gonna be hell but you

3034.319 --> 3039.2
can think of it as heaven

3036.64 --> 3041.2
right yeah in your [ __ ] imagination

3039.2 --> 3044.64
you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want it

3041.2 --> 3044.64
doesn't have to make sense

3044.96 --> 3050.2400000000002
in physical reality though

3047.2 --> 3052.8799999999997
in this simulatory existence

3050.24 --> 3055.839
yeah things can only work if they can

3052.88 --> 3055.839
work

3060.72 --> 3064.7599999999998
no no we can't

3076.72 --> 3083.2799999999997
but i guess that any

3079.28 --> 3085.0400000000004
highly indoctrinated ignorant person

3083.28 --> 3087.0400000000004
or an atheist

3085.04 --> 3089.119
similarly ignorant

3087.04 --> 3090.96
can think that god can do anything

3089.119 --> 3093.76
because you don't understand what it

3090.96 --> 3096.859
even is

3093.76 --> 3096.8590000000004
[Music]

3101.68 --> 3104.68
so

3107.64 --> 3127.04
[Music]

3123.839 --> 3130.16
yeah you yeah you'd have confused yeah

3127.04 --> 3131.68
that's right m appeal

3130.16 --> 3134.319
no

3131.68 --> 3138.96
it has to exist

3134.319 --> 3141.97
existence cannot be there without him

3138.96 --> 3143.52
he's a part of it

3141.97 --> 3146.16
[Music]

3143.52 --> 3147.52
but that doesn't mean he can just

3146.16 --> 3150.319
like

3147.52 --> 3150.319
do whatever

3150.559 --> 3154.8
like random total chaos [ __ ] out of

3153.599 --> 3156.6400000000003
nowhere

3154.8 --> 3161.319
things that are like completely

3156.64 --> 3161.319
illogical no that doesn't happen

3172.72 --> 3178.52
how do i know it's he because i choose

3175.52 --> 3178.52
to

3181.28 --> 3186.88
because i don't give a [ __ ]

3183.119 --> 3188.8
i'm gonna call it a he ahi yeah

3186.88 --> 3191.2000000000003
creator of all things has a freaking

3188.8 --> 3193.28
penis you get it

3191.2 --> 3194.96
i don't give a [ __ ] if it makes no sense

3193.28 --> 3196.96
i'm gonna call it a he

3194.96 --> 3197.76
and i think everybody that whines about

3196.96 --> 3200.0
that

3197.76 --> 3202.7200000000003
just [ __ ] off i don't care what you

3200.0 --> 3206.0
think about it i'm gonna call him a he

3202.72 --> 3208.5589999999997
you get it he god a he

3206.0 --> 3209.92
a man with a dick

3208.559 --> 3214.3190000000004
all right

3209.92 --> 3217.359
god has a penis get over it

3214.319 --> 3220.4
he doesn't actually have one

3217.359 --> 3225.0789999999997
but i think of him as having one and if

3220.4 --> 3225.079
you can't handle that then [ __ ] off

3247.359 --> 3251.68
ah

3249.599 --> 3254.559
bet it's massive dude

3251.68 --> 3256.48
what do you think you're standing on

3254.559 --> 3258.88
dick earth

3256.48 --> 3261.28
that's god's dick you're standing on

3258.88 --> 3264.92
right now yeah that's how freaking

3261.28 --> 3264.92
massive it is

3266.64 --> 3270.44
and it's rock solid

3275.49 --> 3278.52
[Music]

3280.88 --> 3283.88
uh

3293.68 --> 3299.2799999999997
no no you just need to [ __ ] off

3296.72 --> 3299.2799999999997
wanker

3300.16 --> 3306.68
only god gets the squirt

3303.359 --> 3306.68
not you

3306.72 --> 3310.5989999999997
hold on be right back

3342.319 --> 3345.319
there

3348.96 --> 3353.52
god has a penis yeah but i'm not gonna

3351.119 --> 3353.52
do that

3360.079 --> 3363.799
dick earth skepticism

3364.64 --> 3368.4
well it is very confusing is because

3366.319 --> 3371.359
it's still all flat

3368.4 --> 3373.119
right but yeah even who knows man maybe

3371.359 --> 3375.359
the

3373.119 --> 3378.319
you could geometrically deduce earth to

3375.359 --> 3378.319
be dick shaped

3379.68 --> 3383.48
even though it's all flat

3399.92 --> 3405.16
yeah no i'm not gonna put that in the

3401.76 --> 3405.1600000000003
title thanks

3422.559 --> 3425.559
so

3428.88 --> 3435.599
[Music]

3433.52 --> 3438.319
man i could make so many smutty jokes

3435.599 --> 3438.319
with that [ __ ]

3441.04 --> 3446.16
like every time there's an earthquake

3443.52 --> 3447.52
gods getting excited

3446.16 --> 3450.96
kind of [ __ ]

3447.52 --> 3450.96
dude never stops

3451.119 --> 3456.48
it's once you go there

3454.4 --> 3458.7200000000003
no girl what's a flat dick

3456.48 --> 3460.559
well you don't know matt maybe

3458.72 --> 3463.04
lady god likes it

3460.559 --> 3464.48
maybe he made it just to try and impress

3463.04 --> 3466.319
her or something

3464.48 --> 3467.839
i don't know man this is getting really

3466.319 --> 3469.68
ridiculous but

3467.839 --> 3472.92
i guess there's a time and place for

3469.68 --> 3472.9199999999996
that too

3491.03 --> 3494.1090000000004
[Music]

3497.839 --> 3502.4
earth to globe from space as the

3500.079 --> 3504.7200000000003
dependent variable

3502.4 --> 3504.7200000000003
what

3506.58 --> 3513.96
[Music]

3510.64 --> 3513.96
that's hilarious

3517.18 --> 3531.6989999999996
[Music]

3535.44 --> 3538.319
right

3536.24 --> 3540.72
yeah but yeah you see look the whole

3538.319 --> 3543.359
thing is just very freaking complicated

3540.72 --> 3545.68
when it concerns to well the philosophy

3543.359 --> 3548.64
overarching things

3545.68 --> 3550.3999999999996
like god the creator

3548.64 --> 3552.8799999999997
uh yeah

3550.4 --> 3554.2400000000002
we don't know

3552.88 --> 3557.28
we don't know

3554.24 --> 3559.2
what is beyond god there could literally

3557.28 --> 3562.1600000000003
be

3559.2 --> 3562.16
god could be just

3562.559 --> 3565.76
just

3563.52 --> 3570.319
a god

3565.76 --> 3572.7990000000004
in his society of gods we don't know he

3570.319 --> 3573.7599999999998
might be all alone and earth is all he

3572.799 --> 3575.04
has

3573.76 --> 3577.92
or

3575.04 --> 3580.1
this is just his special broad project

3577.92 --> 3581.76
among the creators

3580.1 --> 3583.2799999999997
[Music]

3581.76 --> 3587.8390000000004
we don't know

3583.28 --> 3587.8390000000004
there's there's no way to tell

3587.92 --> 3592.559
like maybe we get the answers for that

3590.24 --> 3597.2
after death maybe

3592.559 --> 3600.599
or maybe we're simply confined to this

3597.2 --> 3600.5989999999997
to this realm

3602.0 --> 3608.88
or yeah to be just like beside him

3606.0 --> 3612.88
as he is the counterpart in existence of

3608.88 --> 3612.88
the realm we don't know i don't know

3613.119 --> 3616.96
like

3614.64 --> 3616.96
yeah

3617.28 --> 3623.52
makes me feel sometimes like oh yeah

3619.44 --> 3626.16
we're ants in an ant form wondering

3623.52 --> 3627.119
whether the one maintaining us

3626.16 --> 3630.96
like

3627.119 --> 3631.92
does there exist anything beyond

3630.96 --> 3634.48
like

3631.92 --> 3640.52
the ant farm and the one maintaining it

3634.48 --> 3640.52
right we don't know we just don't know

3647.52 --> 3652.68
he might be gay

3649.68 --> 3652.68
no

3656.799 --> 3663.28
oh great leaf blowers yeah

3660.0 --> 3663.28
that's just great man

3664.21 --> 3667.36
[Music]

3668.24 --> 3673.52
no but there's a good chance though that

3670.48 --> 3674.799
just even the concept of sexuality and

3673.52 --> 3678.0
like the

3674.799 --> 3680.559
split up and even procreation are all

3678.0 --> 3683.599
earthly concepts that doesn't apply to

3680.559 --> 3683.599
the realm of gods

3683.76 --> 3687.28
including the creator

3686.48 --> 3690.2400000000002
right

3687.28 --> 3691.3590000000004
so maybe there is no sexuality at all

3690.24 --> 3693.5989999999997
really

3691.359 --> 3695.92
when i said like god has a penis i'm

3693.599 --> 3695.92
just

3696.16 --> 3703.48
i'm just doing that to to poke around

3699.359 --> 3703.48
like i don't think he actually

3718.24 --> 3720.9599999999996
great

3719.2 --> 3723.96
couldn't he just started a half an hour

3720.96 --> 3723.96
later

3731.36 --> 3736.1
[Music]

3736.48 --> 3740.2400000000002
agents did think there was more than one

3738.64 --> 3741.68
god

3740.24 --> 3742.9599999999996
the ancients

3741.68 --> 3745.2799999999997
well look

3742.96 --> 3748.48
the thing is

3745.28 --> 3749.76
it's different right the pantheon for

3748.48 --> 3750.64
example

3749.76 --> 3752.88
are

3750.64 --> 3756.4
earthly gods

3752.88 --> 3759.28
they are gods that are

3756.4 --> 3762.0
intertwined with the management of the

3759.28 --> 3764.4
affairs of things happening on earth

3762.0 --> 3765.76
right pantheon gods

3764.4 --> 3766.839
that's different

3765.76 --> 3770.7200000000003
those are

3766.839 --> 3774.4
effectively sub gods under the creator

3770.72 --> 3776.0
the creator is the full alpha omega of

3774.4 --> 3778.079
the realm

3776.0 --> 3781.119
it's his realm

3778.079 --> 3784.7200000000003
there's only one of them of him

3781.119 --> 3786.28
the god that created it

3784.72 --> 3789.1189999999997
right but

3786.28 --> 3793.6800000000003
outside of the realm we don't know what

3789.119 --> 3793.6800000000003
there is we don't know the frequency

3794.079 --> 3800.1600000000003
that god in its own being is operating

3797.2 --> 3802.96
in there might be others like him that

3800.16 --> 3804.96
have like their own realm

3802.96 --> 3807.359
of which they are the creator god it

3804.96 --> 3808.88
might be very similar to this or like

3807.359 --> 3812.0789999999997
slightly different

3808.88 --> 3813.92
but like we can't even get in yeah we

3812.079 --> 3817.2000000000003
can't even touch that

3813.92 --> 3819.44
like our simulation is not compatible

3817.2 --> 3820.3999999999996
i would probably say

3819.44 --> 3822.4
why

3820.4 --> 3825.839
i'm saying

3822.4 --> 3825.839
weird choice of words there

3828.48 --> 3834.48
so yeah we have the pantheonic gods but

3831.039 --> 3836.8390000000004
they are basically sub gods they are

3834.48 --> 3839.599
gods within this realm

3836.839 --> 3842.48
right so it's almost like the children

3839.599 --> 3842.48
of god or something

3843.039 --> 3846.0
but they are

3844.079 --> 3849.039
bound to this realm

3846.0 --> 3850.839
in even in their descriptions

3849.039 --> 3855.039
when i say other

3850.839 --> 3858.4
gods like the creator

3855.039 --> 3862.0
they have nothing to do with us

3858.4 --> 3863.52
like we would never learn about them

3862.0 --> 3866.16
ever

3863.52 --> 3869.52
because they're not involved they they

3866.16 --> 3870.799
don't even probably take a peek inside

3869.52 --> 3872.72
this realm

3870.799 --> 3876.24
and god is like damn it why is nobody

3872.72 --> 3878.0789999999997
looking at my special boy project

3876.24 --> 3882.64
because they don't care

3878.079 --> 3882.6400000000003
they're doing other stuff something

3889.76 --> 3894.48
yeah sorry creator for calling earth

3892.079 --> 3897.2000000000003
your special boy project that's a

3894.48 --> 3899.359
bit off i'm sorry

3897.2 --> 3901.52
it's too far

3899.359 --> 3904.22
it's just that this kind of getting kind

3901.52 --> 3906.839
of silly anyway

3904.22 --> 3912.359
[Music]

3906.839 --> 3912.359
so it's kind of funny though right

3922.72 --> 3927.52
devil worshipers make penis-shaped

3924.96 --> 3931.48
things to worship what

3927.52 --> 3931.48
why are you getting that from

3932.0 --> 3935.059
[Music]

3936.4 --> 3942.319
suck god and the flat dick yeah that

3939.52 --> 3942.319
sounds gross

3943.52 --> 3947.88
that sounds really trashy

3989.359 --> 3993.68
better than nicole

3991.359 --> 3994.96

youtube's got

4002.24 --> 4007.839
better than a coal i guess i don't know

4004.48 --> 4011.039
a coal is more

4007.839 --> 4013.52
warm warming but it's okay

4011.039 --> 4016.4
and it's a funny super chat

4013.52 --> 4019.7599999999998

4016.4 --> 4022.7200000000003
well unexpected bonuses

4019.76 --> 4022.7200000000003
it seems like

4023.599 --> 4028.2400000000002
yeah i

4025.119 --> 4029.6800000000003
oversized my financial situation to the

4028.24 --> 4031.0389999999998
government

4029.68 --> 4034.64
so

4031.039 --> 4038.1600000000003
they determined that they owed me more

4034.64 --> 4041.2799999999997
which was really unexpected and very

4038.16 --> 4041.2799999999997
very convenient

4046.96 --> 4051.28
like i didn't even realize that i'm that

4049.2 --> 4053.2
good with money i don't even realize

4051.28 --> 4054.799
that [ __ ] yeah

4053.2 --> 4058.0
that that's how

4054.799 --> 4058.0
good i am with money

4058.319 --> 4062.16
right anyway

4060.16 --> 4064.96
i'm doing great and i got the all yeah i

4067.119 --> 4070.799
of support from you guys like even

4069.039 --> 4073.2000000000003
through the hungry times i had a hungry

4070.799 --> 4073.2
weekend

4073.599 --> 4076.559
but

4074.319 --> 4078.5589999999997
that i guess that was

4076.559 --> 4080.7200000000003
even when that happened i just felt like

4078.559 --> 4082.96
i need to do this

4080.72 --> 4085.2
like i need to be

4082.96 --> 4088.079
really minimum no

4085.2 --> 4090.48
drinking no smoking anything and i had

4088.079 --> 4091.599
been like all stressful that time before

4090.48 --> 4095.359
that

4091.599 --> 4097.52
and now i feel like so much better

4095.359 --> 4097.5199999999995
so

4100.159 --> 4107.04
20 canadian dollars is like

4103.52 --> 4107.040000000001
50 i don't know what that means

4111.52 --> 4117.96
pesos rockets monuments

4114.56 --> 4117.96
tall buildings

4121.04 --> 4124.48
i don't know jeff gas head

4127.92 --> 4132.56
are you sure yeah well the ibiza's

4130.08 --> 4135.2789999999995
rocket okay okay yeah definitely but

4132.56 --> 4138.159000000001
yeah that guy's gay so

4135.279 --> 4141.159000000001
it's not surprising

4138.159 --> 4141.159
but

4148.319 --> 4153.52
i'm not even sure like is that like

4150.64 --> 4156.4800000000005
devil worship

4153.52 --> 4158.56
or is that something else

4156.48 --> 4161.12
i mean

4158.56 --> 4164.96
were the egyptians literally devil

4161.12 --> 4165.759
worshippers the ancient ones literally

4164.96 --> 4168.88
or

4165.759 --> 4172.4
did they just have this

4168.88 --> 4172.400000000001
thing with architecture

4172.719 --> 4176.64
and like

4174.88 --> 4178.96
yeah

4176.64 --> 4178.96
again

4179.199 --> 4183.759
hermetics and all that i don't know

4181.52 --> 4186.2390000000005
necessarily yeah like if it was

4183.759 --> 4188.799
literally penises dude then they would

4186.239 --> 4191.3589999999995
literally make it look like that

4188.799 --> 4193.199
i'm pretty sure that well besides basis

4191.359 --> 4195.4400000000005
rockets

4193.199 --> 4197.12
it doesn't all literally look that like

4195.44 --> 4199.839999999999
that now there's some buildings out

4197.12 --> 4202.5599999999995
there that kind of are suspiciously like

4199.84 --> 4205.679
very much like a penis

4202.56 --> 4207.6
but that's not all of them right

4205.679 --> 4209.6
it's a couple out there

4207.6 --> 4211.4400000000005
that really do look like that owen

4209.6 --> 4214.2390000000005
benjamin had this whole slideshow

4211.44 --> 4215.678999999999
presentation about it one time

4214.239 --> 4217.919999999999
and it does happen out there i just

4215.679 --> 4220.64
don't see it as like that is devil

4217.92 --> 4223.1990000000005
worship i don't see that

4220.64 --> 4223.1990000000005
i think it's

4226.0 --> 4228.4
more just

4227.12 --> 4230.719
like

4228.4 --> 4234.799999999999
kind of basic pagan tendency or

4230.719 --> 4237.52
something it's just more about like oh

4234.8 --> 4238.64
making something appealing on an earthly

4237.52 --> 4241.6
level

4238.64 --> 4245.84
without people realizing it

4241.6 --> 4245.84
i don't know it's not really worship

4247.28 --> 4250.4
hey steamy traveler

4254.719 --> 4259.28
i mean but you can think of it as such

4256.8 --> 4260.719
and it's really funny to do that right

4259.28 --> 4264.32
and then you get

4260.719 --> 4266.2390000000005
ira involved and yeah jesus you know

4264.32 --> 4268.08
that and yeah that's real it's funny to

4266.239 --> 4270.4
think about it like that

4268.08 --> 4273.76
but does it mean that that's absolutely

4270.4 --> 4275.839999999999
real or that's like oh

4273.76 --> 4278.88
devil worshipers are trying to make

4275.84 --> 4282.4800000000005
everything into penises that sounds

4278.88 --> 4282.4800000000005
kind of ridiculous and

4283.04 --> 4286.04
like

4286.239 --> 4291.678999999999
i don't know when like real devil [ __ ]

4289.679 --> 4295.52
is somewhere

4291.679 --> 4297.92
it's kind of in your face like yeah

4295.52 --> 4300.56
[ __ ] psycho

4297.92 --> 4302.96
and like overt

4300.56 --> 4305.6
like yeah it actually looks like a dick

4302.96 --> 4308.8
or a freaking rape or some nightmare

4305.6 --> 4311.1990000000005
torture [ __ ] like it's pretty up front

4308.8 --> 4313.4400000000005
when it is like that right they don't

4311.199 --> 4315.759999999999
exactly hide that

4313.44 --> 4318.32
right so yeah i just

4315.76 --> 4321.04
it doesn't make logical sense to say

4318.32 --> 4321.04
that to me

4321.92 --> 4328.84
this is a really weird show today

4325.52 --> 4328.84
but funny

4332.4 --> 4338.4
i'm still really amazed by my own joke

4336.159 --> 4338.4
like

4338.8 --> 4343.6
the creation is god's special boy

4341.76 --> 4345.12
project

4343.6 --> 4346.8
like

4345.12 --> 4349.679
when you think about the consideration

4346.8 --> 4352.64
that he might be the creator of this

4349.679 --> 4354.88
realm exclusively it's his special boy

4352.64 --> 4356.320000000001
project but there might be others

4354.88 --> 4358.96
doing their own thing and then they

4356.32 --> 4360.32
would regard this realm as his special

4358.96 --> 4362.159
boy project

4360.32 --> 4364.5599999999995
it i don't know it's just

4362.159 --> 4366.879999999999
kind of funny in my head i don't know i

4364.56 --> 4370.080000000001
really don't mean blasphemy

4366.88 --> 4372.32
god i look i am in your design this

4370.08 --> 4373.5199999999995
might be your special boy project but oh

4372.32 --> 4376.719
my god

4373.52 --> 4378.56
you're a you're an amazing designer

4376.719 --> 4380.96
so yeah

4378.56 --> 4384.76
i respect it but it's really funny to

4380.96 --> 4384.76
think about it like this

4401.28 --> 4407.32
so many crude jokes oh yeah i really got

4403.52 --> 4407.320000000001
you going didn't i

4421.76 --> 4425.8
350 what

4429.44 --> 4433.08
oh right

4444.8 --> 4448.320000000001
do you wonder about all the suffering

4446.4 --> 4451.199
why is it necessary

4448.32 --> 4452.88
because it's part of the design

4451.199 --> 4455.759999999999
that's just what it is

4452.88 --> 4457.4400000000005
no i don't wonder about it i wonder why

4455.76 --> 4460.0
anybody

4457.44 --> 4463.12
would be so

4460.0 --> 4465.76
naive to think that anything could exist

4463.12 --> 4465.76
without it

4467.84 --> 4473.679
yeah like in nature

4470.32 --> 4476.639999999999
suffering is standard like nothing in

4473.679 --> 4478.32
nature complains about the suffering

4476.64 --> 4482.96
have you ever paid attention to that

4478.32 --> 4485.199
it's there no no creature ever is like

4482.96 --> 4487.679
like yeah if they've been like

4485.199 --> 4490.5599999999995
in a super traumatic situation they get

4487.679 --> 4492.2390000000005
all blue they can get crazy from it they

4490.56 --> 4494.64
could even die from that because they

4492.239 --> 4497.04
can't recover but even if they recover

4494.64 --> 4500.4800000000005
it's like yeah

4497.04 --> 4503.5199999999995
creatures animals don't complain

4500.48 --> 4508.28
about suffering it just is it's part of

4503.52 --> 4508.280000000001
it it has it it's there

4511.36 --> 4514.639999999999
it's never going to be pleasant

4514.719 --> 4518.84
but it's there for a reason

4524.32 --> 4528.08
right

4525.84 --> 4531.52
like witnessing of suffering is like a

4528.08 --> 4532.32
kick in the butt to people's spirit

4531.52 --> 4535.120000000001
like

4532.32 --> 4535.12
do something

4535.92 --> 4539.56
that's what it is

4542.32 --> 4546.96
right if there was no suffering if it

4544.48 --> 4548.239
wasn't even part of the design

4546.96 --> 4552.2390000000005
then

4548.239 --> 4554.08
nobody nothing would do anything nothing

4552.239 --> 4557.28
would have a point

4554.08 --> 4561.5199999999995
there would be no reason for emotion for

4557.28 --> 4561.5199999999995
change nothing everything would just

4561.679 --> 4565.0
do nothing

4570.719 --> 4574.96
so it's incorporated it's incorporate

4573.28 --> 4577.28
everybody

4574.96 --> 4579.6
everything

4577.28 --> 4582.159
within their lifespan

4579.6 --> 4587.120000000001
will know suffering it's part of the

4582.159 --> 4592.92
design it like it can't logically work

4587.12 --> 4592.92
to the depth that it can without it

4596.719 --> 4601.199
no we cannot do anything

4599.199 --> 4603.36
professor phil well you don't even

4601.199 --> 4605.759999999999
believe in god what the hell are you

4603.36 --> 4605.759999999999
saying

4606.0 --> 4610.48
at least i think you don't maybe you do

4608.239 --> 4612.718999999999
but it's weird

4610.48 --> 4617.199
weird to hear you say that

4612.719 --> 4621.0
but no god cannot do everything

4617.199 --> 4621.0
he designed it

4622.239 --> 4626.0
can't just like bloop oh it's different

4624.64 --> 4628.320000000001
now no

4626.0 --> 4628.32
never

4628.64 --> 4632.88
like

4629.52 --> 4632.88
the way things work

4633.76 --> 4638.88
the design itself

4635.679 --> 4641.92
can change a lot

4638.88 --> 4644.159000000001
way beyond our primitive typical comfort

4641.92 --> 4645.28
zone based comprehension

4644.159 --> 4648.08
yeah

4645.28 --> 4651.84
that's not god the designer that had

4648.08 --> 4651.84
designed it all going there like

4652.08 --> 4657.44
i'm gonna do this now no

4655.6 --> 4661.2390000000005
[ __ ]

4657.44 --> 4661.239
it's all incorporated

4674.0 --> 4677.0
right

4679.76 --> 4684.0
this myth

4681.12 --> 4687.12
that you can supposedly just get the

4684.0 --> 4692.44
designer in on your side to change

4687.12 --> 4692.44
things radically is is ridiculous

4694.0 --> 4698.159
no

4695.36 --> 4699.839999999999
things change as they have been set into

4698.159 --> 4702.639999999999
motion

4699.84 --> 4705.28
as the design

4702.64 --> 4706.8
and the whole point is to understand how

4705.28 --> 4709.5199999999995
things go

4706.8 --> 4711.76
and how they unravel

4709.52 --> 4714.64
and what you can do

4711.76 --> 4714.64
by your will

4717.12 --> 4722.8
like if anything your will can change

4719.76 --> 4722.8
things in this world

4723.199 --> 4727.919999999999
and then you could arguably speculate

4725.92 --> 4730.32
that like yeah but what is our

4727.92 --> 4733.1990000000005
consciousness and our will in each

4730.32 --> 4735.599999999999
individual maybe there is a part of god

4733.199 --> 4737.28
there and then i'd say like yeah yeah

4735.6 --> 4738.4800000000005
you have a point i think that the

4737.28 --> 4740.96
creator

4738.48 --> 4743.12
made us all and we are all basically

4740.96 --> 4744.96
fragments of god

4743.12 --> 4748.64
and that

4744.96 --> 4750.96
yeah through us god's will can manifest

4748.64 --> 4753.280000000001
but it's part of the design we are part

4750.96 --> 4756.4800000000005
of the design so god's not gonna

4753.28 --> 4758.719
separately like a separate entity going

4756.48 --> 4762.239
to interfere

4758.719 --> 4763.52
i don't think he does

4762.239 --> 4765.759999999999
i think he's

4763.52 --> 4768.2390000000005
just on the outside having pre-designed

4765.76 --> 4768.2390000000005
everything

4770.159 --> 4773.36
and at best he can

4772.48 --> 4777.759999999999
share

4773.36 --> 4780.4
information with his creations man

4777.76 --> 4782.4800000000005
is the source of information and he can

4780.4 --> 4785.5199999999995
enlighten us

4782.48 --> 4788.639999999999
with the glory of the design

4785.52 --> 4792.0
and then we can manifest change

4788.64 --> 4795.92
from within the design

4792.0 --> 4795.92
doesn't that seem a lot more logical

4798.48 --> 4802.08
anyway i'm gonna round out the show it's

4800.719 --> 4805.12
weird

4802.08 --> 4807.36
weird little funny show

4805.12 --> 4809.92
i'm not gonna get over the

4807.36 --> 4812.799999999999
god's little special boy project

4809.92 --> 4814.56
it's hilarious

4812.8 --> 4816.88
but anyway

4814.56 --> 4818.96
