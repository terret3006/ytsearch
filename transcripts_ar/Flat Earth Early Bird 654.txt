81.2 --> 91.119
earth early bird number 654

86.56 --> 91.119
know why

91.36 --> 98.479
it took the old title again

94.799 --> 100.73
i don't get it so let me change that for

98.479 --> 102.799
a second

100.73 --> 105.52000000000001
[Music]

[Music]

111.439 --> 117.36
right there you go so anyway uh

114.88 --> 117.89999999999999
yeah the weather today is quite changed

117.36 --> 119.439
around

117.9 --> 122.32000000000001
[Music]

119.439 --> 124.719
it's clouded it's windy and it's kind of

122.32 --> 124.719
cold

125.36 --> 129.92
so yeah very different from yesterday in

129.119 --> 133.039
the

129.92 --> 133.039
two days before that

137.04 --> 143.76
it's a very much like a

140.319 --> 147.28
work days weather because

143.76 --> 147.28
yeah this would be pretty good

147.36 --> 156.0
whether to basically do work

150.56 --> 159.28
stay very active

156.0 --> 159.28
right so anyway

160.16 --> 165.04
we're turning on some engine right when

163.519 --> 168.16
it started to show so that

165.04 --> 171.84
yeah close the door anyway let's see

168.16 --> 171.84
who's in chat

175.93 --> 181.76000000000002
[Music]

177.76 --> 185.84
ubfm was first lou

181.76 --> 190.159
tom parker good servant over mccool

185.84 --> 191.84
yeah good to see you so far i started on

190.159 --> 195.67999999999998
time this time

191.84 --> 195.68
how about that exactly on time

196.48 --> 203.84
so how are you guys i got

200.0 --> 203.84
just green tea with me no coffee

204.0 --> 207.36
because i don't need any more coffee i

206.159 --> 210.239
got i got up

207.36 --> 213.84
like really late i did go to bed kind of

210.239 --> 213.84
late as well

219.84 --> 223.28
so yeah yesterday

223.68 --> 228.08
yeah yesterday flatters debates were

225.76 --> 232.239
kind of good

228.08 --> 234.56
really good got a lot of say in there

232.239 --> 236.08
although uh yeah after the show ended

234.56 --> 239.36
that was a weird man

236.08 --> 242.959
like um chocolate brian and me

239.36 --> 245.84
kind of hanged hung around afterward

242.959 --> 246.64000000000001
and then i got a bit pissed off at them

245.84 --> 249.92000000000002
because

246.64 --> 251.599
yeah i tried to explain to them

249.92 --> 253.28
it's not like it's the first time been

251.599 --> 254.879
doing that even before the flat earth

253.28 --> 258.16
debate

254.879 --> 260.4
how yeah an angular size

258.16 --> 261.68
change of the sun at any point is

260.4 --> 264.79999999999995
absolutely not

261.68 --> 268.24
proof of a of it

264.8 --> 270.16
going into the distance son or the moon

268.24 --> 271.84000000000003
any celestial object it's not proof of

270.16 --> 273.68
going to the distance because the

271.84 --> 276.79999999999995
angular speed

273.68 --> 280.0
is not changing the angular speed

276.8 --> 281.52000000000004
remains consistent so yeah that doesn't

280.0 --> 283.36
correlate

281.52 --> 285.12
with something moving into the distance

283.36 --> 287.04
if something is growing smaller because

285.12 --> 289.52
it's moving into the distance then the

287.04 --> 292.56
angular speed

289.52 --> 294.32
should also be changing and it's not

292.56 --> 296.08
angular speeds of all the celestial

294.32 --> 299.12
bodies are pretty much

296.08 --> 299.12
exactly the same

299.52 --> 304.96
at all points even at the horizon so

303.039 --> 306.8
and they didn't get it and i had to like

304.96 --> 310.56
explain them four times and then i just

306.8 --> 314.16
got sick of it

310.56 --> 314.16
a police in there what

315.759 --> 322.72
what are you talking about good servant

319.28 --> 322.71999999999997
and thanks for sharing the link by the

322.84 --> 325.84
way

329.52 --> 331.84
right

335.84 --> 340.63899999999995
hey emmanuel by the way

347.6 --> 351.12
oh right to smiley

351.68 --> 358.8
if a police girl smiley

354.72 --> 367.84000000000003
in there that's funny

358.8 --> 367.84000000000003
yeah i see it now

369.35 --> 374.8
[Music]

371.12 --> 374.8
all right so anyway uh yeah

375.44 --> 379.12
flat of debates it was pretty good i was

377.84 --> 381.84
very fired up

379.12 --> 381.84000000000003
pretty much

382.16 --> 388.96000000000004
the most of it and uh

385.759 --> 393.039
yeah after that was it again

388.96 --> 393.039
oh yeah uh nathan

393.12 --> 398.8
restreamed his under the dome

396.24 --> 400.72
stream with paul on the plane and

398.8 --> 403.68
mitchell from australia if i

400.72 --> 404.96000000000004
remember that correctly and yeah i

403.68 --> 406.639
didn't get to

404.96 --> 408.31899999999996
watch it through and through because

406.639 --> 411.84000000000003
like after what is it

408.319 --> 414.08000000000004
after like a half an hour or less

411.84 --> 416.88
20 minutes like my friend from them

414.08 --> 420.0
called me up again and we had like a

416.88 --> 423.759
one half hour conversation

420.0 --> 427.12
yeah you'll be fm look it's happening

423.759 --> 432.08000000000004
it's eight now by the way but

427.12 --> 432.08
yeah it's interesting

434.24 --> 439.039
yeah by the way you be you are a baller

437.039 --> 443.52
right you you kind of told me

439.039 --> 446.8
in the comment section not that i mind

443.52 --> 450.479
because i do appreciate that you're

446.8 --> 454.479
basically complaining against

450.479 --> 456.71999999999997
you just this youtube activity choking

454.479 --> 457.84
it because it's it's bad news all of it

456.72 --> 461.28000000000003
it's

457.84 --> 465.11999999999995
and it's happening constantly now

461.28 --> 468.15999999999997
like you know i used to think that

465.12 --> 471.039
maybe youtube was

468.16 --> 473.03900000000004
like slowing my progress overall little

471.039 --> 475.599
and then i got really pissed off with

473.039 --> 477.36
the 5 000 subscriber rant as everybody

475.599 --> 479.28
remembers of course on the entire

477.36 --> 481.28000000000003
youtube

479.28 --> 482.71999999999997
still like to remind me of that and i

481.28 --> 485.599
don't care because

482.72 --> 486.879
yeah it is funny that i did that it was

485.599 --> 489.199
also very much

486.879 --> 490.319
meant because i was really pissed off

489.199 --> 492.08
about it at the time

490.319 --> 494.96000000000004
and had to do with just my option to

492.08 --> 494.96
monetize so

498.879 --> 505.199
but yeah these days it's it's much worse

502.16 --> 508.879
they're they're rigging it badly

505.199 --> 512.08
nowadays let me check

508.879 --> 512.08
yesterday shows that

512.159 --> 516.3199999999999
right yeah yesterday's show is now set

514.719 --> 519.36
at three up votes ooh

516.32 --> 521.839
they were generous this time and 26 down

519.36 --> 521.839
votes

526.48 --> 531.44
so let's see what uh

531.839 --> 538.9590000000001
religion goes down goes boom boom

535.519 --> 543.2
episode is now like all right still

538.959 --> 549.8389999999999
only two up votes and 45 down

543.2 --> 549.839
even though it has 364 views now

553.36 --> 559.279
so i guess only two people in the entire

556.24 --> 560.88
world from the 364 that saw it

559.279 --> 562.88
must have liked that show and everybody

560.88 --> 564.0
else must have hated it or didn't care

562.88 --> 569.519
right

564.0 --> 569.519
because that's what this system suggests

570.16 --> 573.12
the way that it's looking

573.44 --> 578.24
yeah anyway i'm not gonna spend the

575.36 --> 580.88
entire episode complaining

578.24 --> 582.48
about the rigging but it is really

580.88 --> 591.8389999999999
happening

582.48 --> 591.839
and i wish it did just stop it

593.2 --> 597.44
all right well yeah tiny one ball that

595.839 --> 599.36
is interesting i didn't know you had a

597.44 --> 602.72
music channel

599.36 --> 606.64
and yes it is a lot of work to do that

602.72 --> 608.8000000000001
you have a lot of competition though and

606.64 --> 611.519
yeah i know how tough it is to start up

608.8 --> 613.92
like nathan has given many

611.519 --> 615.76
speeches about this you could say about

613.92 --> 618.88
how tough it is to really get

615.76 --> 621.76
a youtube rolling but

618.88 --> 622.56
yeah hey arguably my youtube has been

621.76 --> 625.6
rolling

622.56 --> 629.3599999999999
for a long time now five years

625.6 --> 632.5600000000001
three of which every day every day

629.36 --> 634.24
live okay imagine so

632.56 --> 636.399
and i've reached that thousand

634.24 --> 639.6
subscriber mark a long time ago but now

636.399 --> 639.6
yeah it's it's just stuck

640.88 --> 647.279
it's like literally stuck at

644.839 --> 649.36
1760 subscribers

647.279 --> 650.64
even though yeah i actually meet people

649.36 --> 655.2
in discord and in

650.64 --> 657.1999999999999
other other youtube chats

655.2 --> 658.48
that literally tell me like hey whoa

657.2 --> 660.399
this is

658.48 --> 662.48
yeah i like what you have to say i'll

660.399 --> 665.12
check out your channel and subscribe

662.48 --> 666.24
well youtube subscriber amount's not

665.12 --> 669.279
reflecting it because

666.24 --> 674.16
yeah just like two months ago maybe more

669.279 --> 678.399
it's still set to 1760.

674.16 --> 678.399
it's not rigged at all

678.959 --> 684.4799999999999
so yeah not everybody has that sort of

681.76 --> 684.48
thing going on

687.6 --> 692.0790000000001
right and yeah tiny one more added as

691.279 --> 696.0
well

692.079 --> 699.12
there's not a lot of yeah academic level

696.0 --> 702.16
cosmogonical theorists out there or

699.12 --> 703.12
any if you met some that would be

702.16 --> 706.3199999999999
interesting to hear

703.12 --> 709.6
i haven't met anyone that focuses

706.32 --> 717.839
as much and in as in depth

709.6 --> 717.839
on that sort of subject as i do

718.56 --> 722.4799999999999
although yeah arguably qe basically does

721.68 --> 725.4399999999999
that

722.48 --> 726.0
as well he does really purely focus on

725.44 --> 727.6
it

726.0 --> 731.76
but then again he's not much of a

727.6 --> 734.8000000000001
theorist he's just an academic it just

731.76 --> 736.0
teaches about that now i adapt those

734.8 --> 739.279
teachings

736.0 --> 741.68
but at the same time i i also keep on

739.279 --> 743.4399999999999
modeling and conceptualizing about the

741.68 --> 746.079
remaining possibilities

743.44 --> 747.44
how that works and yeah don't see a lot

746.079 --> 750.079
of that

747.44 --> 751.6
so yeah i got a relatively unique little

750.079 --> 755.4399999999999
corner that i

751.6 --> 757.839
basically created corner in

755.44 --> 759.6800000000001
in the market you could say but yeah

757.839 --> 760.32
youtube doesn't seem to really care

759.68 --> 763.3599999999999
about that

760.32 --> 764.0790000000001
at all they'd like it to go away

763.36 --> 766.24
apparently

764.079 --> 768.079
they don't want some new field of study

766.24 --> 771.519
to basically open up so they're choking

768.079 --> 771.519
me they're choking me hard

771.68 --> 777.12
and that they'd rather just give some

774.8 --> 779.519
random guys out there that are making

777.12 --> 781.36
standard videos about subjects that have

779.519 --> 783.839
all been talked about a hundred or a

781.36 --> 787.2
thousand times over

783.839 --> 790.639
by innumerable amounts of people

787.2 --> 793.2
since five years ago now they'll they'll

790.639 --> 794.48
they'll let them go you know as long as

793.2 --> 797.6800000000001
it's old

794.48 --> 800.32
everybody's already known that

797.68 --> 802.3199999999999
as long as it just seems outdated

800.32 --> 805.0400000000001
somehow though give it

802.32 --> 807.0400000000001
the front row seats you know outdated

805.04 --> 808.639
information is just great they they want

807.04 --> 812.079
that out there

808.639 --> 815.6800000000001
you know the more mistakes you make

812.079 --> 818.88
considering like flat earth

815.68 --> 820.399
and even yeah medical situ anything that

818.88 --> 822.079
is just really outdated

820.399 --> 824.399
it's going to be shoved forward you know

822.079 --> 825.519
people chat they'll they'll get it

824.399 --> 827.04
they'll appreciate they don't even

825.519 --> 828.5600000000001
recognize like you know that may be

827.04 --> 830.7199999999999
a bit old you know because there's

828.56 --> 832.959
plenty of people around that do keep

830.72 --> 835.1990000000001
track

832.959 --> 838.0
of that sort of thing but youtube

835.199 --> 838.0
doesn't like it

839.92 --> 846.3199999999999
and yeah especially if you are like a

843.279 --> 849.68
doctor they'll just take you off

846.32 --> 852.399
at this point i don't proclaim to be a

849.68 --> 856.3199999999999
medical doctor

852.399 --> 860.959
i just say no i declare myself

856.32 --> 865.1990000000001
my own doctor and i have done and acted

860.959 --> 865.199
as such for for quite a while now

866.72 --> 870.0
but yeah that's something else so i

868.56 --> 872.0
don't think they really care about

870.0 --> 873.36
that and i still got plenty of problems

872.0 --> 876.0
you know so

873.36 --> 876.88
for the general image people out there

876.0 --> 878.72
and of how

876.88 --> 880.0
businesses work and how the medical

878.72 --> 884.0
industrial complex

880.0 --> 886.399
works the allopathics you know

884.0 --> 888.24
if you're gonna say like yeah yeah i

886.399 --> 891.36
handle my own health my own

888.24 --> 894.0
problems medically

891.36 --> 895.839
and you're just saying yeah i still have

894.0 --> 896.959
a lot of problems this is how i treat it

895.839 --> 900.32
yeah i don't

896.959 --> 902.2399999999999
go like i suffer through

900.32 --> 903.519
certain things because i believe that's

902.24 --> 906.399
actually better for you

903.519 --> 907.279
well that is to i guess the widest

906.399 --> 910.32
amount of people

907.279 --> 912.079
so unappealing that they'll just be like

910.32 --> 915.12
oh yeah yeah sure you say that

912.079 --> 919.4399999999999
because that'll put everyone off

915.12 --> 921.92
although yeah that is that may be true

919.44 --> 923.0400000000001
but then again there's plenty of people

921.92 --> 925.199
that

923.04 --> 926.8
really trying to learn trying to pay

925.199 --> 930.16
attention and they'll try to

926.8 --> 932.0
see like hmm why why is he doing that

930.16 --> 934.88
what am i referencing like things like

932.0 --> 936.88
german new medicine very alternative

934.88 --> 938.56
very very counter opposite to

936.88 --> 941.92
allopathics

938.56 --> 944.6389999999999
and they will appreciate

941.92 --> 946.88
what i do and and keep closer track and

944.639 --> 950.5600000000001
see if they can like puzzle it out like

946.88 --> 953.519
i try to puzzle out what's going on

950.56 --> 954.3199999999999
so yeah it's a weird little balance my

953.519 --> 957.36
channel

954.32 --> 960.72
and what i talk about but

957.36 --> 964.639
yeah overall despite me not being

960.72 --> 967.9200000000001
too much of a danger i think

964.639 --> 970.32
to the the most at hand plans being

967.92 --> 972.4799999999999
rolled out by the system

970.32 --> 974.0
the corporate megacorp yeah the mega

972.48 --> 976.639
corporations

974.0 --> 977.6
they still don't like me they don't want

976.639 --> 980.639
me

977.6 --> 982.9590000000001
further at the further in view

980.639 --> 985.199
for the for the for the world as it were

982.959 --> 985.199
so

985.6 --> 991.12
that's why i guess they choked me they

988.32 --> 991.12
choked my channel

991.839 --> 995.2790000000001
it doesn't really matter though because

993.519 --> 997.04
yeah there's so many people that know me

995.279 --> 999.759
now that have heard of me that'll

997.04 --> 1002.8
recognize even the way i speak

999.759 --> 1006.24
or and

1002.8 --> 1007.3599999999999
become expectant even like oh arwyn's

1006.24 --> 1009.279
there

1007.36 --> 1011.04
what is he gonna bring up this time what

1009.279 --> 1013.519
am i going to think of this time

1011.04 --> 1016.959
because i do think of good ideas or like

1013.519 --> 1019.68
good ways to say certain things

1016.959 --> 1022.3199999999999
good way to summarize things now

1019.68 --> 1024.72
everybody can do that of course but

1022.32 --> 1026.559
i don't know i have this weird little

1024.72 --> 1029.3600000000001
thing routed in my ego

1026.559 --> 1031.6789999999999
no less that i want to be the best at

1029.36 --> 1031.6789999999999
that

1032.079 --> 1035.4389999999999
it's actually kind of an annoying trait

1033.919 --> 1037.6000000000001
but i managed to now

1035.439 --> 1040.4
use it for something good instead of

1037.6 --> 1042.1599999999999
just annoying people all the time

1040.4 --> 1044.24
well there's plenty of bowlers that are

1042.16 --> 1047.52
still going to be annoyed as [ __ ] by me

1044.24 --> 1047.52
of course but that's okay

1048.96 --> 1053.3600000000001
oh well gortel yander if you don't think

1051.84 --> 1056.48
google worries about me then

1053.36 --> 1059.4399999999998
why have i been stuck to 1760

1056.48 --> 1063.039
subscribers for two or three months

1059.44 --> 1066.48
non-stop unchanging when

1063.039 --> 1068.799
i've literally spoken to new people

1066.48 --> 1070.4
seen them join the show seem then come

1068.799 --> 1072.799
in my chat

1070.4 --> 1074.88
having said their subscribers for

1072.799 --> 1076.559
there's no reason for me to

1074.88 --> 1079.3600000000001
think they're not subscribing because

1076.559 --> 1081.6789999999999
they're just acting like good people

1079.36 --> 1083.12
and yeah the the amount of subscribers

1081.679 --> 1084.72
hasn't changed for three months even

1083.12 --> 1088.559
though there's probably been like

1084.72 --> 1091.28
20 30 40 people at least joined me

1088.559 --> 1091.84
that even kind of were verbal about it

1091.28 --> 1094.0
so

1091.84 --> 1096.1599999999999
you really think google doesn't worry

1094.0 --> 1100.48
about our windshield

1096.16 --> 1102.799
then then why then why cut it off

1100.48 --> 1102.799
you know

1103.84 --> 1109.84
can you can you answer that quartal

1106.84 --> 1109.84
gender

1140.4 --> 1143.3600000000001
social blade

1146.96 --> 1151.8400000000001
so no response nothing

1152.11 --> 1155.1799999999998
[Music]

1157.919 --> 1162.5590000000002
i'm flagged what does that mean matthew

1162.84 --> 1165.84
mitchell

1188.88 --> 1193.8400000000001
the subject matter

1196.72 --> 1200.64
so you think it's purely because of that

1199.6 --> 1203.4399999999998
i'm just

1200.64 --> 1205.679
you're we're not supposed to be allowed

1203.44 --> 1206.0800000000002
to talk about flat earth in general and

1205.679 --> 1209.1200000000001
if you

1206.08 --> 1210.48
are without ridicule then are you saying

1209.12 --> 1213.52
it's standard policy

1210.48 --> 1215.039
that just you're just not gonna be

1213.52 --> 1218.32
you're not gonna have any new

1215.039 --> 1220.1589999999999
subscribers be registered

1218.32 --> 1222.1589999999999
and they're gonna screw with your voting

1220.159 --> 1222.88
system is that what you're saying is

1222.159 --> 1227.5200000000002
that

1222.88 --> 1230.0800000000002
official does everybody have that

1227.52 --> 1231.52
i don't think so there's look there's

1230.08 --> 1235.84
flat earthers out there that have

1231.52 --> 1235.84
huge channels huge

1236.0 --> 1249.84
so yeah explain that to me then

1263.84 --> 1268.24
yeah and tiny wombo ooh nathan gets more

1266.4 --> 1271.2
subscribers because

1268.24 --> 1272.48
people just like to hear morons being

1271.2 --> 1276.4
ravaged

1272.48 --> 1278.4
yeah i could argue for that sure but hey

1276.4 --> 1282.72
i do that too you know

1278.4 --> 1284.5590000000002
and yeah even two days ago the sunday

1282.72 --> 1288.0
episode

1284.559 --> 1292.32
right it got a lot of views still

1288.0 --> 1295.679
no alteration whatsoever besides that

1292.32 --> 1295.6789999999999
so how does that work

1297.12 --> 1299.9189999999999
yeah william

1300.559 --> 1303.52
get the [ __ ] out

1303.6 --> 1307.4399999999998
i'm not talking about dinner here

1309.039 --> 1319.84
stop wasting my time

1321.84 --> 1327.52
no but golden border yeah promoting flat

1325.52 --> 1328.4
earth channels that's all very cute and

1327.52 --> 1331.679
nice you know i

1328.4 --> 1332.159
yeah i don't expect that my videos or my

1331.679 --> 1334.3200000000002
channel

1332.159 --> 1336.5590000000002
is going to pop up in the suggestion

1334.32 --> 1339.6789999999999
list of the general youtube public

1336.559 --> 1342.72
yeah i'm not even talking about that

1339.679 --> 1344.159
i don't care you know i expect that only

1342.72 --> 1347.3600000000001
people that'll look

1344.159 --> 1349.1200000000001
me out look me up will find me that's

1347.36 --> 1350.7199999999998
not what i'm talking about i'm talking

1349.12 --> 1354.3999999999999
about

1350.72 --> 1357.84
no growth in the channel visible

1354.4 --> 1360.3200000000002
even though i am like provably growing

1357.84 --> 1362.08
i'm expanding i'm getting more known

1360.32 --> 1365.84
people literally telling me i'm

1362.08 --> 1369.9189999999999
subscribing new people in the chat

1365.84 --> 1369.9189999999999
so how does that make any liquor sense

1370.72 --> 1377.3600000000001
that's that's not promotion that's not

1374.4 --> 1377.8400000000001
they don't promote me no they're choking

1377.36 --> 1380.24
me

1377.84 --> 1382.799
that's not the same as not promoting you

1380.24 --> 1385.84
know i understand they don't promote me

1382.799 --> 1389.6
i don't care never did because i'm

1385.84 --> 1392.799
promoting myself by my actions and my

1389.6 --> 1396.7199999999998
my dealings on other channels

1392.799 --> 1396.72
and i spent a lot of time on that

1398.24 --> 1402.159
i think that overall my amount of

1400.4 --> 1405.3600000000001
speaking on youtube

1402.159 --> 1409.1200000000001
in general is probably over

1405.36 --> 1412.1589999999999
over 5 000 hours in total

1409.12 --> 1414.84
spread out incredible

1412.159 --> 1417.44
amount of youtube presence incredible

1414.84 --> 1421.1999999999998
amount

1417.44 --> 1421.2
even for a flat earther so

1421.279 --> 1424.96
yeah i don't need that promotion i

1423.84 --> 1427.6
promote myself

1424.96 --> 1430.159
but what i do need is just for them to

1427.6 --> 1434.48
stop choking my channel

1430.159 --> 1434.48
and stop rigging the numbers

1438.88 --> 1445.8400000000001
yeah right tom parker i know

1447.2 --> 1452.159
what flat earth channel is huge many and

1450.32 --> 1454.1589999999999
i'm not talking about millions okay

1452.159 --> 1455.279
that don't even care about that but

1454.159 --> 1457.3600000000001
there's just

1455.279 --> 1461.2
loads of people that have 10 thousand

1457.36 --> 1461.1999999999998
subscribers a hundred thousand

1461.36 --> 1465.12
plenty plenty

1465.2 --> 1472.64
like hundreds

1468.32 --> 1474.48
so why is my channel specifically stuck

1472.64 --> 1476.0800000000002
for over three months not the first time

1474.48 --> 1479.2
they kept me stuck at a number

1476.08 --> 1481.1999999999998
why is it stuck at 70 60 for over three

1479.2 --> 1487.8400000000001
months

1481.2 --> 1487.8400000000001
makes no damn sense

1488.799 --> 1492.6399999999999
yeah but matthew mitchell yeah i know

1490.64 --> 1494.5590000000002
owen talked about the algorithm

1492.64 --> 1496.3200000000002
and for people like owen that's even

1494.559 --> 1499.6789999999999
more logical because he's kind of a

1496.32 --> 1503.279
famous comedian so yeah

1499.679 --> 1506.0
that becomes even more blatantly obvious

1503.279 --> 1508.48
i'm not a famous comedian i'm just a

1506.0 --> 1511.84
youtuber

1508.48 --> 1514.96
flat earther theoretical cosmogenic

1511.84 --> 1519.039
cosmo yeah cosmogenist so

1514.96 --> 1521.6000000000001
just a guy but

1519.039 --> 1522.64
i don't expect to be promoted but this

1521.6 --> 1525.039
choking

1522.64 --> 1529.8400000000001
the choking of my channel that makes no

1525.039 --> 1529.84
[ __ ] sense

1537.12 --> 1543.6
yeah and it doesn't really matter matter

1540.72 --> 1545.76
whether i swear or not by the way like

1543.6 --> 1548.7199999999998
youtube doesn't give a [ __ ]

1545.76 --> 1550.72
at all like nothing i don't even have

1548.72 --> 1553.679
any advertisement issues

1550.72 --> 1555.44
when i swear did you know that the

1553.679 --> 1558.48
sunday episode

1555.44 --> 1561.1200000000001
they didn't even like give me like oh

1558.48 --> 1562.4
not all companies want to advertise for

1561.12 --> 1566.559
this because

1562.4 --> 1570.4
no nothing they don't care

1566.559 --> 1573.9189999999999
at all at all no no no but they will

1570.4 --> 1577.679
choke me they will just say no nobody

1573.919 --> 1580.0800000000002
will be added on to that nothing

1577.679 --> 1581.8400000000001
but hey i can damn well monetize all my

1580.08 --> 1584.8799999999999
videos and all that advertisement yeah

1581.84 --> 1588.1589999999999
that keeps on rolling it does

1584.88 --> 1591.44
so they're gladly just siphon off me

1588.159 --> 1593.679
some of my work make money from it

1591.44 --> 1594.799
but they won't allow my channel to grow

1593.679 --> 1613.8400000000001
so why

1594.799 --> 1613.84
why is that why is that youtube

1615.36 --> 1621.1999999999998
block anything against the grain but

1617.44 --> 1621.2
that's technically just not true

1621.919 --> 1628.3200000000002
there is so much

1625.2 --> 1632.799
out there that goes against the grain

1628.32 --> 1636.799
a lot of people and growing

1632.799 --> 1638.8799999999999
so how am i going against the grain is

1636.799 --> 1639.679
it because i'm saying the earth is not a

1638.88 --> 1642.3200000000002
disk

1639.679 --> 1643.44
is it that is that too controversial for

1642.32 --> 1646.559
youtube

1643.44 --> 1648.799
like if i just say if i just declare one

1646.559 --> 1652.399
day okay guys

1648.799 --> 1654.8799999999999
given it a lot of thought and

1652.399 --> 1655.6
yeah my earlier assessments you know

1654.88 --> 1657.7600000000002
about

1655.6 --> 1658.799
potential looping realms that's just

1657.76 --> 1662.1589999999999
wrong because it's

1658.799 --> 1664.1589999999999
just a disc with the dome it's just

1662.159 --> 1666.8400000000001
this with the dumb does that mean that

1664.159 --> 1669.44
youtube's then gonna

1666.84 --> 1672.559
unleash unleash it again

1669.44 --> 1675.039
is that the condition youtube

1672.559 --> 1675.84
if i just say okay yeah screw screw all

1675.039 --> 1678.559
these ideas

1675.84 --> 1679.6789999999999
it's just a freaking snow globe dome

1678.559 --> 1681.12
with a disc

1679.679 --> 1683.8400000000001
is that good enough for your youtube

1681.12 --> 1683.84
does that mean

1685.52 --> 1697.84
that'll that you'll leave me alone is

1688.08 --> 1697.84
that how it works youtube

1702.559 --> 1711.84
what the [ __ ] become a jew

1706.08 --> 1711.84
that's ridiculous

1713.36 --> 1717.4399999999998
you know what what does that even mean

1715.84 --> 1720.0
you mean go through the weird little

1717.44 --> 1720.0
rituals

1721.44 --> 1725.8400000000001
like reading that book backwards and all

1723.44 --> 1725.8400000000001
that [ __ ]

1728.88 --> 1731.8400000000001
i i don't get it

1736.0 --> 1740.08
because if you're just looking by my

1738.08 --> 1740.96
intellectual legacy the way i think the

1740.08 --> 1744.399
way i approach

1740.96 --> 1746.559
things yeah

1744.399 --> 1749.039
i i'm not gonna be alone out there i i

1746.559 --> 1752.08
bet there's probably plenty of

1749.039 --> 1754.8799999999999
like a free-minded

1752.08 --> 1755.6789999999999
jewish people maybe sort of liberal but

1754.88 --> 1758.7990000000002
not

1755.679 --> 1760.88
like yeah communist liberal they'll

1758.799 --> 1762.8799999999999
probably think like yeah i like the way

1760.88 --> 1765.2
this guy talks

1762.88 --> 1766.3200000000002
i kind of think like that as well and

1765.2 --> 1768.24
yeah in the past

1766.32 --> 1770.1589999999999
i kind of thought like hey yeah jews are

1768.24 --> 1772.96
kind of awesome

1770.159 --> 1776.5590000000002
some of those that i met and yeah my

1772.96 --> 1776.559
family was with that as well

1776.64 --> 1779.76
and then yeah you figure out oh wait

1778.24 --> 1782.3990000000001
there's also psycho

1779.76 --> 1784.559
psychotic grabblers and they're

1782.399 --> 1787.6
manipulating the [ __ ] and they're like

1784.559 --> 1790.8799999999999
pushing the real jews around

1787.6 --> 1793.36
as it were right so yeah

1790.88 --> 1795.0390000000002
you you could almost already say that i

1793.36 --> 1798.8799999999999
am kind of a jew

1795.039 --> 1801.52
yeah hear that everyone i might be a jew

1798.88 --> 1801.5200000000002
i might be

1802.799 --> 1810.08
so yeah you you make up your mind

1806.799 --> 1811.679
right i don't think it helps i don't

1810.08 --> 1813.039
think any of that helps you know you

1811.679 --> 1824.159
could say all kinds of

1813.039 --> 1824.1589999999999
silly things it's not gonna matter right

1830.159 --> 1833.8400000000001
i don't think that it works like that

1832.88 --> 1837.279
it's not like oh

1833.84 --> 1840.399
okay you're a jew now hmm

1837.279 --> 1841.679
well that means we can't bother you

1840.399 --> 1844.8799999999999
anymore then

1841.679 --> 1845.44
no absolutely not doesn't matter if

1844.88 --> 1849.2
you're

1845.44 --> 1850.88
you if you are and you're going to be

1849.2 --> 1853.919
promoting flat earth out there they're

1850.88 --> 1858.159
just going to choke you

1853.919 --> 1858.159
there's i'm pretty sure they still will

1859.12 --> 1862.9599999999998
although i should probably nah that's

1862.64 --> 1866.159
not

1862.96 --> 1868.64
that shouldn't that's not logical

1866.159 --> 1869.519
i'd say david weiss but yeah david wise

1868.64 --> 1872.7990000000002
is

1869.519 --> 1874.88
basically a self-professed christian

1872.799 --> 1877.2
are you then a jew does it work like

1874.88 --> 1878.5590000000002
that or you have to be born like one i

1877.2 --> 1880.88
don't know man

1878.559 --> 1883.279
i don't even know like what the people

1880.88 --> 1885.919
that have these controls

1883.279 --> 1886.399
over all these systems how they even see

1885.919 --> 1888.3990000000001
it

1886.399 --> 1890.8799999999999
because i don't think it has anything to

1888.399 --> 1894.08
do with actual reality it's just

1890.88 --> 1895.7600000000002
how they think reality is it

1894.08 --> 1897.6
that does kind of happen with grabblers

1895.76 --> 1899.84
you know when you completely turn the

1897.6 --> 1902.48
entire world inside out

1899.84 --> 1904.399
and just make everybody believe lies

1902.48 --> 1907.279
then they're gonna have their own

1904.399 --> 1908.9599999999998
reversed sub world that they presume

1907.279 --> 1910.64
reality is but

1908.96 --> 1913.1200000000001
what's who's to say that that is

1910.64 --> 1914.7990000000002
actually the real real that's actually

1913.12 --> 1918.6399999999999
grounded in any sort of reality it's

1914.799 --> 1921.6
more like a secret convention

1918.64 --> 1924.48
like that doesn't have to do anything

1921.6 --> 1926.6399999999999
with reality at all

1924.48 --> 1930.88
and yeah who's there to correct them if

1926.64 --> 1930.88
no if almost nobody knows about it you

1932.84 --> 1935.84
know

1938.32 --> 1940.6399999999999
what

1944.399 --> 1950.559
choose look

1948.08 --> 1950.559
okay

1958.32 --> 1968.48
no agm where are you getting this

1963.039 --> 1972.24
look he was born in a jewish family

1968.48 --> 1974.64
right so by that standard yeah

1972.24 --> 1975.279
but technically hey it's a religion

1974.64 --> 1979.039
right so

1975.279 --> 1979.039
you can't be born like that

1979.679 --> 1983.6000000000001
technically although they will just

1982.24 --> 1985.279
consider it

1983.6 --> 1989.279
if you approach it like it's some kind

1985.279 --> 1992.32
of genetic inheritance or something

1989.279 --> 1994.88
but i'm pretty damn sure that he is a

1992.32 --> 1994.8799999999999
christian

1995.039 --> 2005.84
as far as i know at least so i don't

1997.84 --> 2005.84
know where you're getting that

2016.84 --> 2019.84
hmm

2025.6 --> 2032.1599999999999
yeah michael rook look it doesn't make a

2027.679 --> 2035.3390000000002
whole lot of sense

2032.16 --> 2035.3390000000002
[Music]

2090.96 --> 2103.839
pk wasn't saying too much i i don't know

2094.159 --> 2103.839
what you're talking about

2105.98 --> 2109.17
[Music]

2112.23 --> 2115.489
[Music]

2127.76 --> 2131.76
what are you blabbering about reptilians

2130.16 --> 2134.8799999999997
grace

2131.76 --> 2136.48
that's all heliocentric c.i.a fantasy

2134.88 --> 2138.96
[ __ ]

2136.48 --> 2140.48
all derived from extra-dimensional

2138.96 --> 2143.28
spiritual

2140.48 --> 2144.079
sights and experiences there's nothing

2143.28 --> 2150.079
literal about

2144.079 --> 2150.079
it there's no freaking evidence

2156.839 --> 2161.0789999999997
whatsoever

2157.9 --> 2161.079
[Music]

2173.079 --> 2177.92
abbreviate it what tiny one more

2184.32 --> 2201.839
where are you getting this nonsense

2208.56 --> 2212.7999999999997
yeah i bet she was amanda young because

2210.72 --> 2213.68
that's the new religion that's the new

2212.8 --> 2216.48
legacy

2213.68 --> 2219.9199999999996
right first they told the world was a

2216.48 --> 2223.119
globe and that god didn't exist

2219.92 --> 2224.2400000000002
then they were all like oh aliens look

2223.119 --> 2227.44
ufos

2224.24 --> 2228.3999999999996
this visitors from another world and now

2227.44 --> 2230.96
it's like oh let's

2228.4 --> 2231.6800000000003
standardize that let's expand upon that

2230.96 --> 2234.96
yeah yeah

2231.68 --> 2236.24
these are the type of aliens that exist

2234.96 --> 2238.96
that's what they've been working on the

2236.24 --> 2241.7599999999998
last 30 years

2238.96 --> 2243.52
right it's all [ __ ] there's no

2241.76 --> 2246.0
evidence of any of this

2243.52 --> 2246.0
at all

2250.56 --> 2257.839
uh what okay i don't know where you're

2254.48 --> 2257.839
getting that george sanford

2258.72 --> 2260.9599999999996
no

2267.28 --> 2273.0400000000004
yeah it's it's very simple

2270.96 --> 2274.56
you can think about it all day and

2273.04 --> 2277.839
fantasize all day you're

2274.56 --> 2282.0
never ever nobody in this world is

2277.839 --> 2285.839
ever going to meet a reptilian or a gray

2282.0 --> 2288.4
in the real time-bound 3d

2285.839 --> 2289.119
physical reality world it's never going

2288.4 --> 2292.8
to happen

2289.119 --> 2296.32
ever ever you get it

2292.8 --> 2299.44
because they don't exist they're not

2296.32 --> 2302.88
physical real things they're made up

2299.44 --> 2305.44
stories false equivocations

2302.88 --> 2307.839
like reified into physical reality

2305.44 --> 2311.119
storytelling tradition

2307.839 --> 2313.839
from spiritual experiences

2311.119 --> 2313.839
spiritual

2316.56 --> 2322.48
because yeah you bet your ass there's

2318.96 --> 2324.56
all kinds of weird spirits out there

2322.48 --> 2326.4
different levels of frequencies and it's

2324.56 --> 2328.48
really weird because yeah

2326.4 --> 2331.04
spiritualists that deal with that and

2328.48 --> 2334.16
realize it is spirits they even

2331.04 --> 2337.2799999999997
refer to them as specific

2334.16 --> 2339.04
planet people yeah

2337.28 --> 2341.0400000000004
but yeah guess what those planets are

2339.04 --> 2343.44
not actually physical

2341.04 --> 2344.48
in a physical outer space it's like a

2343.44 --> 2347.599
spiritual

2344.48 --> 2351.28
thing it's frequencies and

2347.599 --> 2351.28
yeah a certain frequency then

2352.839 --> 2360.0789999999997
hosts certain types of mindset

2357.04 --> 2363.52
creatures spirits non-humans

2360.079 --> 2365.6800000000003
not living right

2363.52 --> 2367.599
and they are at that frequency and that

2365.68 --> 2368.0
could be considered a planet it makes it

2367.599 --> 2370.96
much

2368.0 --> 2371.359
easier for people to visualize it but

2370.96 --> 2375.44
it's

2371.359 --> 2377.839
not physical none of it ever was

2375.44 --> 2377.839
ever

2379.68 --> 2385.2799999999997
yeah when do you get when do you get the

2382.16 --> 2387.2799999999997
most alien sightings right

2385.28 --> 2388.5600000000004
is it in periods when people suddenly

2387.28 --> 2389.6800000000003
start to experiment him with

2388.56 --> 2393.52
hallucinogenic

2389.68 --> 2396.8799999999997
drugs why would that be

2393.52 --> 2399.119
is it because it is on their mind

2396.88 --> 2400.7200000000003
or is it because yeah that sort of stuff

2399.119 --> 2403.839
typically

2400.72 --> 2405.68
breaks out your spirit puts it on

2403.839 --> 2406.319
another frequency where you suddenly

2405.68 --> 2409.44
start to see

2406.319 --> 2409.44
spiritual things

2409.68 --> 2415.04
and yeah there's definitely spirits out

2412.079 --> 2415.04
there i believe

2415.44 --> 2418.64
and yeah in the right state you can

2417.2 --> 2421.52
actually see them goody

2418.64 --> 2421.92
it's not going to do you a lot of good

2421.52 --> 2424.16
though

2421.92 --> 2424.96
there's not no no thing you can get out

2424.16 --> 2428.8799999999997
of it except

2424.96 --> 2431.119
i don't know degrading yourself to

2428.88 --> 2432.96
their spiritual frequencies which is

2431.119 --> 2434.96
usually not a very good idea and then

2432.96 --> 2436.7200000000003
you might get some idea of well i don't

2434.96 --> 2438.96
know i could use this

2436.72 --> 2439.9199999999996
yeah it's effectively just the same as

2438.96 --> 2442.56
yeah

2439.92 --> 2443.6800000000003
ticket of the devil doesn't matter if

2442.56 --> 2447.44
it's

2443.68 --> 2449.44
presented as some species or something

2447.44 --> 2450.96
it's stepping away from your humanity

2449.44 --> 2452.88
when you do that because they're not

2450.96 --> 2456.96
human

2452.88 --> 2460.6400000000003
and adapting to them is not a good idea

2456.96 --> 2460.64
so yeah non-physical

2462.8 --> 2472.0
physical aliens reptiles

2467.44 --> 2472.0
and grays don't exist

2472.64 --> 2476.319
but there are spirits out there that

2474.64 --> 2481.839
yeah do kind of

2476.319 --> 2481.839
abide by the descriptions

2486.11 --> 2489.7490000000003
[Music]

2497.44 --> 2504.56
oh sure i'm a cabra militia

2501.04 --> 2506.56
what kind of name is that yeah sure

2504.56 --> 2507.68
yeah those spirits hey it's they're

2506.56 --> 2509.7599999999998
spirits right

2507.68 --> 2511.44
well the bible can't told you about that

2509.76 --> 2514.3190000000004
what spirits typically do

2511.44 --> 2515.44
so yeah that makes sense i'll bet you

2514.319 --> 2517.359
now i've never

2515.44 --> 2519.359
faced a face in a spiritual experience

2517.359 --> 2520.0789999999997
and walked up to a reptilian or a gray

2519.359 --> 2521.839
and talked

2520.079 --> 2523.3590000000004
and asked them what they believed

2521.839 --> 2525.44
because i already knew that just by

2523.359 --> 2528.64
looking at it in the frequency because

2525.44 --> 2531.119
i am a powerful spirit my observation

2528.64 --> 2532.96
senses go beyond communication

2531.119 --> 2534.1600000000003
especially in the spirit realm it's a

2532.96 --> 2536.48
unique trait i have

2534.16 --> 2538.0
very lucky with that or cursed however

2536.48 --> 2539.44
you're going to regard that

2538.0 --> 2540.24
but yeah i'm damn well sure that if

2539.44 --> 2541.119
you're going to have a spiritual

2540.24 --> 2542.3999999999996
experience you're going to talk with

2541.119 --> 2544.1600000000003
them and they're going to say oh yeah of

2542.4 --> 2546.2400000000002
course there is a goal whoa

2544.16 --> 2547.52
god what is this nonsense no we're our

2546.24 --> 2551.359
own gods yeah it's

2547.52 --> 2553.68
it of course duh of course that's the

2551.359 --> 2553.68
case

2557.76 --> 2561.8390000000004
it doesn't matter in what cloak or in

2559.68 --> 2566.0789999999997
what backstory they come you will know

2561.839 --> 2569.04
them by the essence of it

2566.079 --> 2569.04
it's very easy

2571.04 --> 2573.839
if you focus

2577.28 --> 2581.92
that the guys who think rocks are alive

2586.4 --> 2590.7200000000003
well i think that rocks are like a

2589.359 --> 2594.72
mineral life form

2590.72 --> 2597.839
but yeah sort of they're not really

2594.72 --> 2600.8799999999997
sentient but they do like

2597.839 --> 2604.0789999999997
there is a like a spiritual

2600.88 --> 2607.2000000000003
crystalline effect

2604.079 --> 2610.88
with them and some

2607.2 --> 2610.8799999999997
stones actually do grow

2611.76 --> 2618.0
and even like multiply so

2614.8 --> 2618.8
yeah that exists of course that's sort

2618.0 --> 2621.68
of

2618.8 --> 2626.1600000000003
consideration of a life form is yeah

2621.68 --> 2626.16
it's very far away even from plant life

2626.56 --> 2632.0
but yeah you could classify it as like a

2628.96 --> 2634.64
minor life form very minor

2632.0 --> 2636.4
so i don't know i don't object to people

2634.64 --> 2639.5989999999997
saying that rocks are alive it's

2636.4 --> 2643.04
it's just that people that suggest that

2639.599 --> 2646.079
they themselves are evolved from

2643.04 --> 2648.319
very complicated rocks now that's

2646.079 --> 2650.4
where it becomes ridiculous especially

2648.319 --> 2651.2
because evolution is complete [ __ ]

2650.4 --> 2654.2000000000003
and has no

2651.2 --> 2656.24
evidence for it whatsoever it's a

2654.2 --> 2659.359
eugenics-based

2656.24 --> 2663.839
anti-god fantasy story

2659.359 --> 2663.839
that's absolutely ridiculous

2664.48 --> 2668.079
made by a very hateful person that at

2667.2 --> 2671.5989999999997
the time was

2668.079 --> 2674.8
very hated nobody liked him

2671.599 --> 2676.56
everybody hated that guy darwin because

2674.8 --> 2680.8
he was a complete [ __ ]

2676.56 --> 2684.72
and disgusting and a racist a eugenicist

2680.8 --> 2685.599
he almost created it like he was one of

2684.72 --> 2688.3999999999996
the first

2685.599 --> 2690.3700000000003
to really put that into into society

2688.4 --> 2693.55
like that

2690.37 --> 2693.5499999999997
[Music]

2698.8 --> 2705.44
giant dragons from the past well

2702.16 --> 2706.319
who knows happy look in pre-atlantean

2705.44 --> 2709.68
age

2706.319 --> 2713.7599999999998
there went some really weird [ __ ] down

2709.68 --> 2717.5989999999997
so yeah i think that the idea

2713.76 --> 2720.1600000000003
the concept that giant mountain

2717.599 --> 2720.6400000000003
rock formations out there might actually

2720.16 --> 2724.0
be

2720.64 --> 2727.04
sort of a petrified or

2724.0 --> 2729.92
minerally transmutated

2727.04 --> 2732.0
ancient life forms yeah i could

2729.92 --> 2734.56
absolutely go with that

2732.0 --> 2736.72
there's just mind-boggling amounts of

2734.56 --> 2739.68
indications for that like even the way

2736.72 --> 2740.319
certain rocks when you open them up that

2739.68 --> 2743.359
they just

2740.319 --> 2747.119
resemble joint systems like

2743.359 --> 2749.04
different types of tissue will reflect

2747.119 --> 2751.76
themselves in the type of mineral

2749.04 --> 2753.04
sediment within very specific locations

2751.76 --> 2757.599
in certain

2753.04 --> 2758.88
stones so yeah yeah i can absolutely go

2757.599 --> 2761.599
with that

2758.88 --> 2763.52
absolutely it's a thousand times more

2761.599 --> 2768.6400000000003
likely than

2763.52 --> 2772.8
physical reptilian and grays

2768.64 --> 2775.839
existing physically in the realm

2772.8 --> 2775.8390000000004
yeah that's right

2777.74 --> 2780.81
[Music]

2784.96 --> 2790.7200000000003
no macabre and with that name

2788.079 --> 2792.079
you know you're not even gonna say

2790.72 --> 2794.8799999999997
anything about it

2792.079 --> 2796.0
when you carry a name like that yeah

2794.88 --> 2799.599
that's

2796.0 --> 2801.2
that's a satanist name you do realize

2799.599 --> 2802.96
that right

2801.2 --> 2805.1189999999997
i know a lot of trolls do it like that

2802.96 --> 2808.359
but yeah

2805.119 --> 2810.96
no darwin

2808.359 --> 2811.7599999999998
egalitarian whatever blah blah blah no

2810.96 --> 2816.16
no

2811.76 --> 2820.1600000000003
he was a disgusting racist individual

2816.16 --> 2824.24
probably not only a eugenicist but

2820.16 --> 2828.16
also in the crowd that actually created

2824.24 --> 2831.5989999999997
marxism yeah

2828.16 --> 2834.56
one of those one of the worst scumbags

2831.599 --> 2844.88
that ever roamed the earth

2834.56 --> 2849.44
so yeah

2844.88 --> 2854.1600000000003
the origin of species oh my god

2849.44 --> 2854.16
that's one of the worst books

2856.839 --> 2860.5589999999997
ever

2858.4 --> 2862.48
that's actually portrayed to be some

2860.559 --> 2873.8390000000004
kind of study

2862.48 --> 2873.839
absolutely ridiculous

2876.8 --> 2881.04
yeah that's right i never read it or

2879.28 --> 2884.2400000000002
maybe i have i just

2881.04 --> 2887.04
just forgot about it but i've studied up

2884.24 --> 2889.1189999999997
on darwin plenty

2887.04 --> 2890.96
and yeah the connections are there the

2889.119 --> 2893.28
communications are there there

2890.96 --> 2894.48
there's letters back and forth all that

2893.28 --> 2897.2000000000003
is all registered

2894.48 --> 2898.16
right yeah yeah i'm pretty sure that he

2897.2 --> 2901.839
was

2898.16 --> 2901.839
exactly how i described him

2902.559 --> 2906.559
and yeah when you're like that that

2904.88 --> 2909.52
point it doesn't even matter

2906.559 --> 2912.1600000000003
anymore how they write a book you know

2909.52 --> 2915.839
what it's going to be

2912.16 --> 2915.839
you know what came out of him

2920.75 --> 2923.88
[Music]

2940.839 --> 2943.839
do

2944.4 --> 2948.7200000000003
jesus are you actually one of the sad

2947.359 --> 2950.7999999999997
people out there that has

2948.72 --> 2956.24
studied that [ __ ] do you actually

2950.8 --> 2959.2000000000003
believe evolution

2956.24 --> 2961.9199999999996
one of the most [ __ ] theories ever

2959.2 --> 2961.9199999999996
conceived

2969.359 --> 2973.7599999999998
you do realize that the study of

2971.44 --> 2977.52
genetics and then the follow-up

2973.76 --> 2980.8
epigenetics adamantly

2977.52 --> 2983.119
and absolutely undeniably disproved

2980.8 --> 2986.559
evolution

2983.119 --> 2989.599
entropy makes evolution

2986.559 --> 2992.1600000000003
impossible it's not

2989.599 --> 2992.1600000000003
possible

2992.64 --> 2997.68
where genetics work how they actually

2995.52 --> 3000.8
tend to degenerate over time

2997.68 --> 3001.2
how mutation works all of biology all of

3000.8 --> 3004.7200000000003
it

3001.2 --> 3006.96
completely disproves evolution every

3004.72 --> 3007.839
step of the way if you don't want to

3006.96 --> 3009.92
know that

3007.839 --> 3013.839
then you're just as dumb as a globe

3009.92 --> 3013.839
believer really

3017.93 --> 3021.1
[Music]

3023.24 --> 3026.5099999999998
[Music]

3033.359 --> 3040.72
yeah well macabre mulifica

3037.76 --> 3041.28
god get another name man yeah spencer

3040.72 --> 3044.24
may have

3041.28 --> 3045.8390000000004
literally drew out the eugenics tree in

3044.24 --> 3048.9599999999996
those plants

3045.839 --> 3049.92
but darwin look it's a mindset man don't

3048.96 --> 3053.44
you even see it

3049.92 --> 3058.7200000000003
it's the mindset it's the idea it's

3053.44 --> 3062.96
the arrogance the arrogance and just

3058.72 --> 3064.8799999999997
putting one over the other that

3062.96 --> 3066.96
is what darwin is a part of that's what

3064.88 --> 3068.6400000000003
he did and then spencer may have written

3066.96 --> 3070.64
it out and all that

3068.64 --> 3071.839
yeah the laws of thermodynamics yeah

3070.64 --> 3074.0
yeah no no it's not

3071.839 --> 3075.359
it's not about gas pressure expansion

3074.0 --> 3077.92
okay it's not even from

3075.359 --> 3078.72
heat going to cold no it's just entropy

3077.92 --> 3081.92
in

3078.72 --> 3086.24
in general that things degenerate and

3081.92 --> 3086.2400000000002
how genetics actually turned out to work

3086.48 --> 3094.079
it can't evolve it can only degenerate

3090.48 --> 3097.2
and perhaps find the least

3094.079 --> 3099.92
damaged prince and then

3097.2 --> 3102.16
create a new species that's more like

3099.92 --> 3105.2000000000003
the old purer better

3102.16 --> 3108.72
because old is better undamaged

3105.2 --> 3111.7599999999998
is better mutation is not good mutation

3108.72 --> 3115.2
leads to sterilization if for

3111.76 --> 3117.599
infertility always and

3115.2 --> 3119.5989999999997
to erratic and often destructive

3117.599 --> 3125.44
behavior

3119.599 --> 3128.6400000000003
yeah that's what real mutation does

3125.44 --> 3129.559
which is basically damaging genes and

3128.64 --> 3132.24
then

3129.559 --> 3135.92
miraculously surviving with the damaged

3132.24 --> 3138.64
genes that that's exactly what it does

3135.92 --> 3138.96
there's no proof to the contrary of that

3138.64 --> 3142.72
at

3138.96 --> 3143.599
all now of course you can basically try

3142.72 --> 3146.7999999999997
to

3143.599 --> 3150.559
from scratch build some new kind of gene

3146.8 --> 3154.0
thing and that hey it might do something

3150.559 --> 3156.96
but the overall entropy considering what

3154.0 --> 3159.28
i just described is absolutely true

3156.96 --> 3162.2400000000002
the more it evades from the original

3159.28 --> 3165.599
print the more damage the more

3162.24 --> 3168.64
yeah afterward alterations

3165.599 --> 3171.04
further away from the design-centric

3168.64 --> 3171.92
blueprint the original blueprint the

3171.04 --> 3175.119
more

3171.92 --> 3178.0
becomes infertile the more erratic the

3175.119 --> 3178.0
behavior becomes

3178.48 --> 3181.839
and that's how it works

3186.24 --> 3189.5989999999997
yeah keep squirting buddy

3190.319 --> 3193.44
it's not anti-evolutionist you don't

3193.04 --> 3196.079
need

3193.44 --> 3198.4
anti-evolutionist it's wrong it's not

3196.079 --> 3201.119
proven that it's called a theory

3198.4 --> 3201.599
colloquially because there is no proof

3201.119 --> 3204.96
for it

3201.599 --> 3207.52
yet people persist believing in it

3204.96 --> 3208.96
no proof and every time some kind of

3207.52 --> 3210.64
proof is trying

3208.96 --> 3212.079
trying to be discovered as it were by

3210.64 --> 3215.2
these people

3212.079 --> 3218.4
it proves them wrong again every

3215.2 --> 3223.04
freaking time for over a

3218.4 --> 3227.2000000000003
hundred years evolutionist

3223.04 --> 3227.2
believer idiot

3228.079 --> 3234.88
yeah it's just [ __ ] off man blapper

3233.119 --> 3237.839
you're probably that dick again aren't

3234.88 --> 3237.839
you

3238.48 --> 3243.119
i recognize your words sound all started

3241.28 --> 3244.6400000000003
oh you read all that [ __ ] you just

3243.119 --> 3246.559
didn't get any of it because you're a

3244.64 --> 3248.8799999999997
freaking computer that just absorbs

3246.559 --> 3250.4
information and that doesn't put what it

3248.88 --> 3252.88
went together

3250.4 --> 3252.88
are you

3253.44 --> 3259.28
ugh yeah there is no proof for evolution

3261.119 --> 3267.92
and creation is an ontological primitive

3264.96 --> 3270.4
for existence

3267.92 --> 3272.64
the way things are it can only ever have

3270.4 --> 3275.839
been created and therefore only ever

3272.64 --> 3275.839
have been designed

3275.92 --> 3279.839
yeah you can go to

3283.33 --> 3286.46
[Applause]

3287.52 --> 3292.0
yeah i don't need pieces of [ __ ] to

3290.559 --> 3295.44
subscribe to me you get

3292.0 --> 3298.079
it it's not gonna register or maybe

3295.44 --> 3299.28
youtube now only registers pieces of

3298.079 --> 3301.28
[ __ ]

3299.28 --> 3303.6800000000003
being subscribed because they say no no

3301.28 --> 3305.2000000000003
people that actually have sense in them

3303.68 --> 3308.0789999999997
somehow they don't count

3305.2 --> 3309.2799999999997
so we're only going to count troll

3308.079 --> 3311.599
pieces of [ __ ]

3309.28 --> 3313.44
that disagree with you and they're very

3311.599 --> 3314.7200000000003
good at acting like they're smart and

3313.44 --> 3316.799
well read

3314.72 --> 3318.319
so that they can fill your chat and make

3316.799 --> 3320.64
you look dumb

3318.319 --> 3322.0
even though i'm not i know what the [ __ ]

3320.64 --> 3323.359
i'm talking about

3322.0 --> 3325.44
maybe that's what they're trying to do

3323.359 --> 3328.72
well [ __ ] you get the

3325.44 --> 3329.92
[ __ ] out of here man i don't need your

3328.72 --> 3333.2799999999997
[ __ ]

3329.92 --> 3335.28
idiocy in here i don't need your stupid

3333.28 --> 3338.799
luciferian defiance

3335.28 --> 3340.48
and your satanic nihilism [ __ ] get the

3338.799 --> 3348.24
[ __ ] out of this world

3340.48 --> 3351.599
i don't need you

3348.24 --> 3351.5989999999997
tiny one well that's hilarious

3351.92 --> 3356.559
thank you thank you for that that made

3354.16 --> 3356.5589999999997
my day

3357.119 --> 3362.1600000000003
yeah but look just because you believe

3359.68 --> 3363.9199999999996
in the globe

3362.16 --> 3366.0
you know it's very hard to let that one

3363.92 --> 3369.6800000000003
go i watched

3366.0 --> 3369.68
interstellar again yesterday

3370.88 --> 3375.44
and then yeah i got this moment yeah

3373.2 --> 3377.04
yeah i all the ballers are gonna squirt

3375.44 --> 3379.68
so bad over this yeah yeah

3377.04 --> 3380.4
i was watching that like especially with

3379.68 --> 3382.96
the

3380.4 --> 3384.96
tesseract scene and all that and then

3382.96 --> 3387.04
for a moment i was looking outside and

3384.96 --> 3390.48
saw the moon and the stars

3387.04 --> 3392.72
and for just a second i imagined

3390.48 --> 3395.119
like they were actually balls in outer

3392.72 --> 3396.319
space it worked for a second by accident

3395.119 --> 3399.52
it was so funny

3396.319 --> 3402.72
then i realized uh wow

3399.52 --> 3407.44
it's it's really that powerful the spell

3402.72 --> 3407.4399999999996
because it is a spell it is a spell

3409.2 --> 3412.5589999999997
the magic spell based on words and

3411.839 --> 3415.599
thoughts

3412.559 --> 3419.119
specifically taylor designed

3415.599 --> 3422.2400000000002
for the human mind

3419.119 --> 3425.119
for the visual mechanics

3422.24 --> 3426.799
and the social mechanics within the

3425.119 --> 3429.599
human mind

3426.799 --> 3431.04
that's the heliocentric spell it's what

3429.599 --> 3434.1600000000003
it's designed for

3431.04 --> 3435.04
it's the biggest project for mind

3434.16 --> 3438.0
control

3435.04 --> 3439.839
ever devised by human beings or satan if

3438.0 --> 3443.52
you want to see it like that

3439.839 --> 3446.64
spirit of satan certainly lies

3443.52 --> 3448.72
control through lies right so yeah i

3446.64 --> 3450.319
watched it it even worked for a second

3450.319 --> 3456.24
can't let go of the ball

3451.76 --> 3459.0400000000004
it just makes you a bad person if you

3456.24 --> 3459.839
get caught literally provably lying

3459.04 --> 3463.119
about things

3459.839 --> 3466.16
inexcusably and then denying that

3463.119 --> 3466.96
that's that's the bad part if you're

3466.16 --> 3470.24
just

3466.96 --> 3472.079
if you just can't you just like no no no

3470.24 --> 3475.04

believe in the ball that's fine you know

3475.04 --> 3480.48

3478.319 --> 3482.0
but that's not inexcusable no no it's

3480.48 --> 3485.44
just when you literally

3482.0 --> 3487.44
knowingly lie about things to defend

3485.44 --> 3489.599
that belief that image that you don't

3487.44 --> 3491.839
want to let go that's when things become

3489.599 --> 3491.839
bad

3495.119 --> 3503.839
