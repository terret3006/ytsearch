117.299 --> 123.119
like this sleet this wet snow that's

120.72 --> 125.46
sometimes coming down a bit

123.119 --> 127.619
it snowed like all night

125.46 --> 129.539
but I mean in the morning it melted away

127.619 --> 132.06
again

129.539 --> 133.85999999999999
but they're still still like dripping

132.06 --> 135.72
out there I'm not very happy about this

133.86 --> 138.56
because I actually need to go out for

135.72 --> 138.56
groceries later

139.099 --> 145.379
foreign and kind of sucks going on my

142.92 --> 148.39999999999998
bicycle through this weather

145.379 --> 148.39999999999998

[Music]

162.06 --> 165.06

200.4 --> 204.06
about whatever

202.26 --> 207.959
oh also

204.06 --> 210.84

207.959 --> 215.12
stasmorets might be coming on the show

216.36 --> 218.65900000000002

222.659 --> 226.85999999999999
wanted to talk about

225.0 --> 229.019
but uh yeah

226.86 --> 231.59900000000002

229.019 --> 233.84
fun having somebody here on with me

231.599 --> 233.84
again

236.4 --> 239.4
after

237.18 --> 240.84
really try out like stream yard or

239.4 --> 242.76000000000002

Skype interface did not work great last

245.099 --> 247.34
time

253.319 --> 255.79899999999998

[Music]

297.84 --> 302.09999999999997

300.06 --> 304.44
day I didn't really watch my many videos

302.1 --> 307.74
or anything I did watch The Rainmaker

304.44 --> 311.36
movie again which is like I think it's

307.74 --> 311.36
probably one of my favorite movies

313.259 --> 318.90000000000003
it's just a very

316.02 --> 320.639
fun movie to watch

318.9 --> 323.23999999999995
and interesting

320.639 --> 323.24
uh

323.58 --> 326.06
right

328.38 --> 333.979
so when is somebody gonna show up in my

331.8 --> 333.979
chat

346.38 --> 349.58
seven watching

357.479 --> 363.0
so yeah I'm gonna I've been thinking a

360.36 --> 367.139
lot about my show and about what what

363.0 --> 370.02
like what it is hey Richard G

367.139 --> 372.25
I don't recognize you

370.02 --> 375.399
do you change your name

372.25 --> 375.399
[Music]

375.6 --> 379.40000000000003
hello anyway first in chat

391.199 --> 396.12
right but I've been thinking about uh

393.36 --> 399.41900000000004
like this show and it seems like my

396.12 --> 401.34000000000003
audience seems to be mostly American

399.419 --> 403.19899999999996
so

401.34 --> 406.02
I need to just

403.199 --> 407.699
adapt to that and realize that people

406.02 --> 409.79999999999995
that are going to be watching and

407.699 --> 411.0
visiting my show are gonna be like it's

409.8 --> 414.56
in the morning and they're going to be

411.0 --> 414.56
sleepy I shouldn't be yelling

414.6 --> 420.0
at them

417.06 --> 424.16
for not being awake enough

420.0 --> 424.16
ah Richard turn that okay okay

428.419 --> 434.88
yeah you're trying not to be a dick guy

431.6 --> 437.24
that was a fun name though but

434.88 --> 440.21999999999997
oh wait

437.24 --> 441.84000000000003
I don't know what I meant to say is all

440.22 --> 444.8
right

441.84 --> 444.79999999999995
now I know

451.979 --> 457.62
right but anyway yeah the internet ex

454.44 --> 460.139
email exchanges have been fun I like it

457.62 --> 464.0
when people email me when they actually

460.139 --> 464.0
are not just trolls

467.639 --> 471.56
so yeah thanks for the emails

472.68 --> 478.40000000000003
the the guy from The Flat Earth TV guy

475.68 --> 478.40000000000003
was actually

480.18 --> 487.34000000000003
really desperate for a job as a web

483.06 --> 487.34
designer so I gave him some tips but

493.68 --> 496.58
let's see

498.0 --> 503.58
I said that I would link up

500.639 --> 508.52
is fed

503.58 --> 508.52
Flat Earth TV Guide so here it is

510.68 --> 515.419
yeah I'm just boring old Richard okay

521.909 --> 524.999
[Music]

530.1 --> 535.26
yeah by the way Richard where where are

532.38 --> 537.98
you from is it are you British or

535.26 --> 537.98
American

542.94 --> 546.2600000000001
I don't think anybody ever asked

550.85 --> 554.029
[Music]

556.69 --> 559.7790000000001
[Music]

572.519 --> 577.5600000000001
so it seems like it's going to be kind

574.5 --> 581.72
of a slow start today

577.56 --> 581.7199999999999
although yeah at least Richard showed up

582.24 --> 584.48
foreign

585.08 --> 591.1800000000001
people will join and then I can really

589.14 --> 594.1999999999999
start a conversation

591.18 --> 594.1999999999999
our discussion

597.96 --> 601.119
[Music]

614.959 --> 621.5999999999999
right I'm very surprised by the little

618.0 --> 625.8
amount of feedback I actually got

621.6 --> 628.62
from my thermosphere show only people

625.8 --> 630.66
complaining Stone monkey which is like

628.62 --> 633.42
I'm really getting sick of that guy yeah

630.66 --> 637.3389999999999
you heard me I'm getting kind of sick of

633.42 --> 637.3389999999999
you because you're just whining now

637.5 --> 643.08
whining about oh yeah this show is oh

641.04 --> 645.42
you're just like Nathan Oakley I don't

643.08 --> 647.22
like it oh this show is better because

645.42 --> 649.079
you weren't like Nathan Uncle maybe you

647.22 --> 651.6600000000001
should just go [ __ ] yourself

649.079 --> 654.5999999999999
then

651.66 --> 656.64
if that is all you [ __ ] care about

654.6 --> 659.22
if you don't have any arguments you're

656.64 --> 663.12
just hanging around whining

659.22 --> 663.12
whining about people

666.3 --> 670.26
it's kind of annoying because like I

668.579 --> 672.4799999999999
thought that at first a lot of these

670.26 --> 675.54
Ballers that would keep hanging around

672.48 --> 678.0600000000001
and not be just over trolls

675.54 --> 679.8
I thought that they would like kind of

678.06 --> 682.8599999999999
like

679.8 --> 685.14
become real people at some point

682.86 --> 688.38
but unfortunately a lot of them just

685.14 --> 691.26
turn into whining Gammas that just whine

688.38 --> 694.22
about format

691.26 --> 694.22
and that's it

695.16 --> 700.4399999999999
it's like what

697.62 --> 703.5600000000001
what a waste of time

700.44 --> 706.9200000000001
I'm I'm starting to get sorry that I

703.56 --> 709.8
even started this Duo cosmogonical thing

706.92 --> 712.2199999999999
I really am because the Ballers just

709.8 --> 714.24
really suck

712.22 --> 716.22
they do

714.24 --> 718.5600000000001
and even the ones that actually like to

716.22 --> 720.6
hang around here I mean yeah they're

718.56 --> 722.05
fairly decent but when you push them

720.6 --> 724.019
they also suck

722.05 --> 727.019
[Music]

724.019 --> 727.019
foreign

728.1 --> 733.74
you don't have any arguments it's just

730.8 --> 735.54
hanging around on the street for the

733.74 --> 738.6
baller so apparently they like to hang

735.54 --> 741.7199999999999
around just to hang around

738.6 --> 744.72
because they're lonely or something

741.72 --> 748.2
which is quite bizarre

744.72 --> 752.24
since I'm the flat earther and am I not

748.2 --> 752.24
the one so isolated from society

756.54 --> 761.0999999999999
shouldn't there be flat earthers moving

759.06 --> 763.26
in like oh finally we had some place to

761.1 --> 765.839
hang around but no no it's actually the

763.26 --> 768.0
Ballers that want to be in my chat and

765.839 --> 770.82
they get very complaining

768.0 --> 774.0
when they can't be in my chat whining

770.82 --> 775.9200000000001
and making gamma remarks and then they

774.0 --> 778.44
get banned

775.92 --> 782.639
but I mean flat earthers I don't know

778.44 --> 784.98
they don't come around here often

782.639 --> 788.76
maybe it's because they can't just oh

784.98 --> 790.98
flutter flatter than no thinking stupid

788.76 --> 791.76
arguments and then they're okay with

790.98 --> 794.279
that

791.76 --> 796.98
so maybe

794.279 --> 799.56
flat earthers have just become on

796.98 --> 802.5
average way too spoiled

799.56 --> 805.4399999999999
to even take criticism they just think

802.5 --> 809.54
no we believe in Flat Earth so that

805.44 --> 809.5400000000001
means that everything we say is right

811.44 --> 817.44
and yeah I'll be there to to show you

815.16 --> 820.139
the reality of how that's absolutely not

817.44 --> 824.1600000000001
true in many ways and

820.139 --> 826.26
a lot of them don't like it I think

824.16 --> 828.98
it doesn't make them eager to speak up

826.26 --> 828.98
at least

829.5 --> 834.079
which is a shame because I mean yeah the

832.2 --> 836.5790000000001
Earth is flat but

834.079 --> 839.16
isn't there like much more to actually

836.579 --> 841.38
work out and misunderstandings to get

839.16 --> 844.4399999999999
out of the way not just oh we're just

841.38 --> 847.62
going to build some story so that we

844.44 --> 850.3800000000001
have some story to say in response to

847.62 --> 852.42
ball machination [ __ ]

850.38 --> 854.3389999999999
because Ballers claim to have figured

852.42 --> 856.76
out everything which is complete

854.339 --> 856.7600000000001
nonsense

856.98 --> 862.0790000000001
yeah you don't have to compete that by

859.339 --> 863.82
now suddenly having an answer for

862.079 --> 865.3199999999999
everything

863.82 --> 867.3000000000001
you want

865.32 --> 869.88
the truth

867.3 --> 872.0999999999999
if you are truthful

869.88 --> 874.079
about what we know about this world then

872.1 --> 875.76
you would know that we do not know

874.079 --> 878.0999999999999
everything and that a lot of these

875.76 --> 881.76
assumptions that flat earthers roll out

878.1 --> 885.3000000000001
about a disc and about Sun and Moon Over

881.76 --> 887.399
the disk it's complete horshit

885.3 --> 889.9799999999999
there's no evidence for that whatsoever

887.399 --> 893.279
yet Flat Earth is love to regurgitate

889.98 --> 896.22
that [ __ ] and roll it out in a hardcore

893.279 --> 899.3389999999999
debate even like they're so proud of

896.22 --> 902.0400000000001
their stupid incomplete argument just

899.339 --> 905.36
because it it gives an alternative view

902.04 --> 908.76
to the nonsense globers say

905.36 --> 911.72
oh yes so that means it's the truth then

908.76 --> 911.72
no it's not

912.6 --> 917.88
yeah

914.339 --> 922.1990000000001
you want to be on the side of truth then

917.88 --> 924.12
stop asserting things that aren't true

922.199 --> 926.42
just because you want to have some

924.12 --> 926.42
answer

931.68 --> 936.2399999999999
what you think that because you're a

933.839 --> 938.94
flat earther now suddenly you can't be

936.24 --> 941.82
[ __ ] anymore you can't make other

938.94 --> 943.44
flat earthers look stupid oh yeah you

941.82 --> 945.839
can

943.44 --> 948.44
by asserting things that you have no

945.839 --> 948.44
evidence for

954.3 --> 960.779
yeah Richard I know Eric Dubai is a

958.199 --> 963.7199999999999
wanker like that he's never gonna let go

960.779 --> 965.82
of those [ __ ] assertions because he

963.72 --> 967.86
has to have it filled in

965.82 --> 970.38
because if he just starts to say like

967.86 --> 973.019
yeah we're assuming this but actually

970.38 --> 975.0
it's not really there it's not measured

973.019 --> 978.12
it's just calculated just like the

975.0 --> 982.019
globers with another presupposition

978.12 --> 984.0
and yeah if he did that no his massive

982.019 --> 986.519
massive audience would suddenly be like

984.0 --> 989.22
oh he's not a God he doesn't have all

986.519 --> 991.86
the truth oh no

989.22 --> 994.5600000000001
I can't live anymore with myself I

991.86 --> 998.42
thought Eric was so good

994.56 --> 1001.579
because he claimed he knows everything

998.42 --> 1005.079
because you're [ __ ] retards I don't

1001.579 --> 1005.079
care if you're a flat earther

1005.12 --> 1010.519
I don't care

1007.279 --> 1013.279
you just [ __ ] if you just bite

1010.519 --> 1016.6
anything from a flat Earth that it has

1013.279 --> 1016.6
not actually been proven

1018.56 --> 1020.8
foreign

1030.1 --> 1034.819
they all do

1032.179 --> 1037.22
all of them

1034.819 --> 1039.4389999999999
they don't let it go

1037.22 --> 1041.48
they're not gonna let go they're stupid

1039.439 --> 1045.14
assertions that have not been proven

1041.48 --> 1047.299
because they want to be NASA yeah that's

1045.14 --> 1049.8390000000002
the problem this first wave flat

1047.299 --> 1049.839
earthers

1050.179 --> 1058.2800000000002
the whole club buses team they all all

1053.66 --> 1061.16
of them want to replace NASA they all

1058.28 --> 1063.98
want to replace NASA do you get it they

1061.16 --> 1067.28
want to have their Flat Earth [ __ ]

1063.98 --> 1070.66
stories replace NASA's [ __ ] stories

1067.28 --> 1070.66
and that's always been the problem

1071.66 --> 1079.24
Yeah by fighting the Demon they

1074.66 --> 1079.24
immediately sought to replace the demon

1086.679 --> 1093.7
as you can starwater good CEO mystical

1089.419 --> 1093.7
rockhound Terry 306 finally

1093.74 --> 1099.22
finally somebody's else is arriving

1096.02 --> 1099.22
beside Richard

1099.44 --> 1102.4
anyway welcome

1104.96 --> 1108.559
all right

1106.88 --> 1110.96
but I mean

1108.559 --> 1113.36
I don't even watch Eric Dubai's videos

1110.96 --> 1115.4
anymore when he actually talks about oh

1113.36 --> 1117.3799999999999
what is it really like yeah you don't

1115.4 --> 1120.6200000000001
[ __ ] know you're start you're just

1117.38 --> 1122.9
reasserting the same garbage the same

1120.62 --> 1126.3799999999999
unproven garbage as the rest of them

1122.9 --> 1128.8400000000001
Eric I mean I like a lot of your videos

1126.38 --> 1131.66
but when it comes to oh this is what the

1128.84 --> 1134.84
Earth is really like go [ __ ] yourself

1131.66 --> 1139.64
you're reifying ass

1134.84 --> 1142.34
Eric Dubai Eric Dubai the reifying ass

1139.64 --> 1145.76
rolling out repeatedly indoctrinating

1142.34 --> 1147.559
people with an alternative view that has

1145.76 --> 1149.9
not been proven

1147.559 --> 1153.5
you have no confirmation for any of that

1149.9 --> 1156.919
Eric you assert things as if they are

1153.5 --> 1160.28
true when you have no evidence for them

1156.919 --> 1163.46
what is your evidence do you even know

1160.28 --> 1166.52
how to prove things or are you just

1163.46 --> 1168.32
there to assert things and then have

1166.52 --> 1170.36
everybody worship you

1168.32 --> 1172.6399999999999
like anything that comes out of your

1170.36 --> 1175.299
mouth has to be true is that what you

1172.64 --> 1175.2990000000002
like to do Eric

1177.919 --> 1182.98
because it's not helping

1180.98 --> 1186.8600000000001
only thing you're doing is just

1182.98 --> 1191.08
satisfying the demons in ignorant people

1186.86 --> 1191.08
that consider themselves flatter others

1199.6 --> 1205.58
ah okay turret don't know what him not

1204.02 --> 1209.9189999999999
showing up anywhere has to do with

1205.58 --> 1209.9189999999999
anything that I said so far but sure

1210.88 --> 1214.0
all right

1221.08 --> 1228.26
manipulation yeah but it's all horseshit

1224.36 --> 1230.36
it's just sci-fi stories I mean

1228.26 --> 1233.66
Eric the way might have just as well

1230.36 --> 1237.74
become a Sci-Fi Rider using a

1233.66 --> 1239.6000000000001
sci-fi model of Flat Earth

1237.74 --> 1242.799
because he doesn't have proof for the

1239.6 --> 1242.799
things that he claims about it

1244.36 --> 1251.6
so yeah why not go into manipulation of

1248.72 --> 1254.02
time which is literally impossible and

1251.6 --> 1254.02
nonsense

1254.72 --> 1259.94
time isn't even a thing to manipulate

1257.0 --> 1262.46
you can't manipulate time time only

1259.94 --> 1264.98
exists as a substance within

1262.46 --> 1267.98
pseudo-ramonian Force Base Einstein

1264.98 --> 1271.48
Legacy thinking okay

1267.98 --> 1271.48
there's nothing to manipulate

1273.38 --> 1280.2990000000002
it's not a model that that oh wait it's

1277.76 --> 1285.26
not a table it's a piece of furniture

1280.299 --> 1287.48
okay okay sure yes

1285.26 --> 1290.74
mystical Rock hunts

1287.48 --> 1290.74
hey seismrets

1303.98 --> 1309.679
my virtual Summit no I didn't know about

1306.679 --> 1314.799
that turret and I don't give a [ __ ]

1309.679 --> 1314.799
these people are delusional Mystics

1318.22 --> 1324.559
I don't care what they blabber on about

1321.32 --> 1327.2
reifying their stupid [ __ ] I don't care

1324.559 --> 1330.02
I don't care what they do

1327.2 --> 1332.72
they're occult at this point I consider

1330.02 --> 1335.78
them a cult yeah and I'm a flat earther

1332.72 --> 1339.02
I consider

1335.78 --> 1340.46
all of those people

1339.02 --> 1343.22
right

1340.46 --> 1344.96
even Mark sergeant

1343.22 --> 1348.6200000000001
Karen B

1344.96 --> 1351.08
Eren Bob from globusters

1348.62 --> 1354.559
and Eric Dubey

1351.08 --> 1356.36
they're like a cult they just reify the

1354.559 --> 1358.46
same [ __ ] and they all look to each

1356.36 --> 1361.1
other like are you reifying the same

1358.46 --> 1363.919
[ __ ] as we are reifying okay then you're

1361.1 --> 1366.6789999999999
one of us oh no not the Nathan Oakley

1363.919 --> 1369.6200000000001
though because he doesn't reify our

1366.679 --> 1373.1200000000001
[ __ ] assertions so he's not part of

1369.62 --> 1377.1789999999999
his oh he's a scammer he's a chill

1373.12 --> 1381.86
he's there to take down Flat Earth

1377.179 --> 1384.44
yeah no your cultists and your liars and

1381.86 --> 1387.26
you reify [ __ ] you're just trying to

1384.44 --> 1390.0800000000002
compete with NASA with your own [ __ ]

1387.26 --> 1392.86
reification okay that's what you're

1390.08 --> 1392.86
actually doing

1392.96 --> 1397.48
and I want no part of it

1400.14 --> 1403.189
[Music]

1404.559 --> 1410.44
super proud at Santa's Shadow oh well

1407.78 --> 1410.44
good on him

1412.1 --> 1416.62
I think Santa's is a repulsive man

1422.96 --> 1428.38
I would not be proud to even be

1425.0 --> 1431.36
mentioned by Santos I mean [ __ ] that guy

1428.38 --> 1434.44
he is disgusting I don't want to have

1431.36 --> 1434.4399999999998
anything to do with him

1437.66 --> 1443.96
[Music]

1440.679 --> 1447.039
electromagnetics no electromagnetics

1443.96 --> 1447.039
isn't a thing

1447.4 --> 1452.799
electromagnetism however

1449.9 --> 1458.2
yeah that's the thing

1452.799 --> 1458.2
electromagnetics is not a proper word

1465.21 --> 1469.159
[Music]

1467.179 --> 1471.2
tomorrow

1469.159 --> 1474.3400000000001
companies navigate all the way yeah

1471.2 --> 1474.3400000000001
they're using Maps

1474.86 --> 1479.78
and they cross-reference these maps and

1477.32 --> 1482.78
it doesn't tell them what the shape of

1479.78 --> 1485.3799999999999
the earth is they just use the maps for

1482.78 --> 1485.3799999999999
coordination

1485.6 --> 1491.299
right although those Maps will have to

1488.72 --> 1492.8600000000001
have been designed based on of a flat

1491.299 --> 1495.5
plane

1492.86 --> 1496.3999999999999
because of the celestial GP points and

1495.5 --> 1499.52
all that

1496.4 --> 1502.22
it works with a flat plane so yeah all

1499.52 --> 1504.799
the maps are based off flat planes

1502.22 --> 1506.48
because Celestial navigation that

1504.799 --> 1509.179
orientation system and the map

1506.48 --> 1511.64
projections wouldn't work

1509.179 --> 1513.98
if it wasn't based off a flat plane you

1511.64 --> 1516.88
wouldn't have these end results of the

1513.98 --> 1516.88
maps that we have

1517.64 --> 1525.6200000000001
right but they don't use a flat model

1522.559 --> 1529.58
for navigation they don't give a [ __ ]

1525.62 --> 1532.9599999999998
they're just you be using GPS and [ __ ]

1529.58 --> 1536.36
yeah nobody exclusively goes around

1532.96 --> 1537.679
using sextants anymore

1536.36 --> 1540.3799999999999
because

1537.679 --> 1542.72
you got Electronics now

1540.38 --> 1545.0590000000002
yeah and the electronics will tell you

1542.72 --> 1547.279
oh look it's a globe projection really

1545.059 --> 1549.08
you just have to trust us we're saying

1547.279 --> 1551.36
it's a globe projection even though it's

1549.08 --> 1553.279
all based off a flat plane how they

1551.36 --> 1555.62
actually measured these things to

1553.279 --> 1557.24
coordinate them and project it into the

1555.62 --> 1559.52
map projection

1557.24 --> 1563.2
right

1559.52 --> 1563.2
so yeah lull it all up

1573.5 --> 1578.779
where's philby I don't care where Phil B

1576.32 --> 1582.46
is he is a delusional [ __ ] and he

1578.779 --> 1582.46
needs to go to an old man's home

1582.86 --> 1588.4399999999998
I mean I'd send him to a Asylum a

1585.919 --> 1590.659
lunatic asylum but he's just too old for

1588.44 --> 1593.9
that he just needs

1590.659 --> 1596.48
needs a nurse to change his diapers

1593.9 --> 1598.5800000000002
and I don't know getting plenty of

1596.48 --> 1600.98
sunlight and fresh air and just wheel

1598.58 --> 1604.6
him out of the room and back and all

1600.98 --> 1607.46
that [ __ ] I mean who gives a [ __ ] about

1604.6 --> 1612.58
psychotic Phil B at this point

1607.46 --> 1612.58
he's lying like a freaking six year old

1612.86 --> 1617.1399999999999
it's not even amusing anymore man

1620.11 --> 1623.25
[Music]

1629.72 --> 1636.38
All Ships have to require Sexton or just

1633.14 --> 1638.8600000000001
in case okay stash Moretz maybe maybe

1636.38 --> 1638.8600000000001
they do

1639.02 --> 1645.1399999999999
what I mean that's not generally the

1642.919 --> 1647.38
standard go-to piece of equipment now is

1645.14 --> 1647.38
it

1655.4 --> 1660.679
we all can have our model yeah you can

1658.52 --> 1664.1
have whatever you want but if you're

1660.679 --> 1666.14
going to reify things from your model as

1664.1 --> 1667.58
if it were real when you have no

1666.14 --> 1669.2
evidence for it

1667.58 --> 1672.26
then

1669.2 --> 1674.9
you should shut the [ __ ] up

1672.26 --> 1678.3799999999999
if you're gonna assert something as as

1674.9 --> 1681.14
it really is like it's this the sun is

1678.38 --> 1684.7990000000002
3000 Miles up it's bare in a circle over

1681.14 --> 1688.279
the disc then you're a reifying [ __ ]

1684.799 --> 1690.98
and potentially a liar

1688.279 --> 1693.08
because you should know that that's

1690.98 --> 1696.32
[ __ ] at this point there's already

1693.08 --> 1698.779
counter claims against it

1696.32 --> 1701.6589999999999
yeah not from ballers

1698.779 --> 1704.32
from other flat earthers who know it's

1701.659 --> 1704.3200000000002
[ __ ]

1722.84 --> 1726.4599999999998
you think he's stuck

1729.98 --> 1734.74
yes what

1731.659 --> 1734.74
I'm gonna say uh

1735.14 --> 1740.14
oh right okay

1737.659 --> 1740.14
anyway

1743.419 --> 1748.159
David why is it setting up a communal a

1745.7 --> 1751.22
little good for him man y'all go you

1748.159 --> 1753.679
make your communes I told you these

1751.22 --> 1758.419
people are all a bunch of cult leaders

1753.679 --> 1763.1200000000001
yeah they want to replace NASA NASA it's

1758.419 --> 1763.1200000000001
a call too and it had a lot of fanboys

1763.159 --> 1768.0800000000002
they'll just listen and take whatever

1765.14 --> 1771.159
they say right and that's like freaking

1768.08 --> 1771.1589999999999
50 years ago

1773.779 --> 1778.82
and now it's happening all over again

1775.399 --> 1782.779
with these new stupid reified Flat Earth

1778.82 --> 1785.779
disc models and nonsense

1782.779 --> 1788.0
yeah your disc mode this is it this is

1785.779 --> 1790.22
the real thing except it's not the scale

1788.0 --> 1792.08
but we're still going to assert like

1790.22 --> 1794.059
it's the real thing by clicking oh look

1792.08 --> 1795.1999999999998
it's literally there yeah yeah except

1794.059 --> 1797.779
it's not

1795.2 --> 1800.779
in a consistent scale at all

1797.779 --> 1803.48
which you know and you don't mention

1800.779 --> 1805.399
because if you'd mention it every time

1803.48 --> 1809.059
you brought something up

1805.399 --> 1812.4799999999998
about your model everybody would realize

1809.059 --> 1815.1789999999999
it's just another [ __ ] model

1812.48 --> 1819.22
that you're trying to reify into reality

1815.179 --> 1819.22
just like what the globers do

1834.08 --> 1836.5
foreign

1837.279 --> 1842.48
Flat Earth you fell for Dave dude I fell

1840.32 --> 1846.08
for Dave I thought Dave was really

1842.48 --> 1850.159
awesome I still think he's kind of cool

1846.08 --> 1855.9399999999998
but he's a bit of a [ __ ] and he is

1850.159 --> 1855.94
a cuckish part of this NASA group

1856.159 --> 1861.2
this alternative NASA the Flat Earth

1858.62 --> 1864.1399999999999
NASA

1861.2 --> 1868.039
he is part of that

1864.14 --> 1870.5200000000002
he's building his business within that

1868.039 --> 1870.52
system

1875.659 --> 1881.8600000000001
our qualified electrician okay mystical

1878.659 --> 1881.8600000000001
Rock hounds good and you

1882.559 --> 1889.96
there's a small ad no he doesn't

1885.919 --> 1889.96
Dave doesn't wear a small hat

1890.72 --> 1898.039
and yes he comes from a Jewish family

1894.1 --> 1900.26
but he is well self-declared effectively

1898.039 --> 1901.179
a Christian now what does that mean

1900.26 --> 1904.6589999999999
anymore

1901.179 --> 1904.659
absolutely nothing

1904.7 --> 1908.779
I mean what the [ __ ] does it even mean

1906.44 --> 1910.52
if you call yourself a Christian like

1908.779 --> 1912.74
one Christian doesn't even recognize

1910.52 --> 1914.4189999999999
another Christian because they do it

1912.74 --> 1917.08
slightly different so it's all just

1914.419 --> 1917.0800000000002
[ __ ]

1918.62 --> 1923.84
yeah

1920.539 --> 1925.96
I mean I'm not even gonna call myself a

1923.84 --> 1928.299
Christian anymore I just follow Christ

1925.96 --> 1931.76
Christians don't follow Christ

1928.299 --> 1934.52
Christians follow the priesthood that

1931.76 --> 1937.22
surround Christ that tell you that

1934.52 --> 1939.3799999999999
Christ was wrong

1937.22 --> 1941.24
but he's God though

1939.38 --> 1943.0390000000002
yeah he's he's God even though he said

1941.24 --> 1945.279
he isn't God

1943.039 --> 1947.299
and he's the Trinity he's his father

1945.279 --> 1949.7
but he

1947.299 --> 1952.279
he's also wrong about certain things

1949.7 --> 1954.2
right because Paul had to come in and

1952.279 --> 1956.299
correct him yeah and now everybody

1954.2 --> 1959.48
believes that yeah and that's a

1956.299 --> 1962.36
Christian only through that system are

1959.48 --> 1965.72
you a Christian yeah so a Christian is

1962.36 --> 1969.74
actually an anti-christian a Christian

1965.72 --> 1972.6200000000001
is one who claims to follow Christ and

1969.74 --> 1976.36
defiles his legacy

1972.62 --> 1976.36
yeah that's a Christian

1981.919 --> 1986.779
so I'd rather be a Jew at this point I'm

1984.86 --> 1989.539
going with Owen Benjamin on that I'd

1986.779 --> 1992.539
rather be a freaking Jew

1989.539 --> 1992.539
foreign

1998.02 --> 2003.1589999999999
[Music]

2000.88 --> 2005.5
follow Christ I just follow his words

2003.159 --> 2007.3600000000001
his teachings fascinated by him

2005.5 --> 2008.919
fascinated by him as a person I think he

2007.36 --> 2011.58
was the best

2008.919 --> 2011.5800000000002
of us

2011.919 --> 2019.72
he he was the Enlightenment he came in

2015.1 --> 2021.6399999999999
and he brought an enlightened View

2019.72 --> 2025.32
divine

2021.64 --> 2025.3200000000002
that changed everything

2025.899 --> 2030.8799999999999
not because he came and he changed

2028.6 --> 2034.0
something energy no it's because he came

2030.88 --> 2035.2600000000002
and brought the information that changes

2034.0 --> 2038.32
everything

2035.26 --> 2042.46
that's what he did he brought the

2038.32 --> 2045.76
information that changes everything

2042.46 --> 2047.08
through us through the assimilation of

2045.76 --> 2048.339
his information

2047.08 --> 2050.859
yeah

2048.339 --> 2055.0
and the entire church

2050.859 --> 2058.839
systems that grew after that all they

2055.0 --> 2060.82
ever do is to take away that information

2058.839 --> 2063.7
from the public

2060.82 --> 2066.3990000000003
to make them believe something else to

2063.7 --> 2069.58
reinterpret what he says in order to

2066.399 --> 2071.8199999999997
negate what he said all they ever do is

2069.58 --> 2071.8199999999997
that

2076.32 --> 2079.7400000000002
Jews hate Christ

2081.159 --> 2085.54
I don't know do they do they actually or

2083.8 --> 2088.7400000000002
do they just hate Christians because

2085.54 --> 2090.879
they're double speaking lying freaks

2088.74 --> 2092.7999999999997
that don't know what the [ __ ] they're

2090.879 --> 2094.98
doing that don't know who their leaders

2092.8 --> 2094.98
are

2098.26 --> 2102.6400000000003
yeah I'm never gonna hate Grace it's

2100.24 --> 2105.3999999999996
ridiculous

2102.64 --> 2108.8199999999997
but I am kind of

2105.4 --> 2110.079
[ __ ] annoyed by Christians a lot of

2108.82 --> 2112.0
them

2110.079 --> 2114.599
the ones that get in your face are

2112.0 --> 2114.599
unbearable

2114.82 --> 2118.839
they're patronizing they're unbearable

2116.98 --> 2120.82
they're arrogant and they're

2118.839 --> 2124.54
hypocritical

2120.82 --> 2125.92
and they suck they are Pharisees

2124.54 --> 2129.4
yeah

2125.92 --> 2131.7400000000002
he's in your face Christians are

2129.4 --> 2134.5
Pharisees

2131.74 --> 2137.2
they don't follow the teachings of

2134.5 --> 2139.839
Christ they oppose the teachings of

2137.2 --> 2142.06
Christ at every corner yet double

2139.839 --> 2145.7799999999997
speakingly claim that they follow Christ

2142.06 --> 2147.52
their complete pharisaic Liars

2145.78 --> 2150.88
and idiots

2147.52 --> 2154.2
they don't even realize anymore that

2150.88 --> 2157.48
just being on a bandwagon of some kind

2154.2 --> 2159.8799999999997
doesn't allow you give you God's

2157.48 --> 2162.72
permission to act like a double speaking

2159.88 --> 2162.7200000000003
[ __ ] demon

2176.8 --> 2179.76
right

2185.88 --> 2190.32
Jewish genetic no

2190.96 --> 2194.88
hello classical homeopath by the way

2194.98 --> 2200.079
hey they might say it's a bloodline

2196.839 --> 2202.66
thing but that's nonsense I mean Jews

2200.079 --> 2206.099
say a lot of nonsensical things too I'm

2202.66 --> 2206.0989999999997
not saying that they are perfect

2214.839 --> 2220.0
but at least they don't

2217.96 --> 2222.52
at least they're

2220.0 --> 2223.839
I guess more honest with their disdain

2222.52 --> 2226.06
for Christ

2223.839 --> 2230.099
than people that follow him and

2226.06 --> 2230.099
basically refers everything about him

2235.66 --> 2241.48
right I'd rather just have a wolf

2239.079 --> 2244.32
than a wolf in sheep's clothing

2241.48 --> 2244.32
Sage

2245.68 --> 2250.1189999999997
right because the wolf is just a wolf

2247.54 --> 2252.82
you know there's a wolf right if it's a

2250.119 --> 2254.92
wolf that's pretending to be a sheep

2252.82 --> 2257.619
that's much more dangerous you don't

2254.92 --> 2258.94
notice at first they're still gonna eat

2257.619 --> 2261.04
the other sheep though they're gonna

2258.94 --> 2262.9
[ __ ] them up

2261.04 --> 2264.52
if you just know it's a wolf then you

2262.9 --> 2266.079
know oh that's a freaking wolf and you

2264.52 --> 2267.64
know like okay I gotta keep that wolf

2266.079 --> 2269.8
away

2267.64 --> 2273.46
right

2269.8 --> 2276.9
so yeah I'd rather have a Jew than a

2273.46 --> 2276.9
Christian at this point

2279.099 --> 2284.32
like well yeah

2281.56 --> 2286.839
it's complicated though because it's

2284.32 --> 2288.7000000000003
just these devil persecuting

2286.839 --> 2291.64
double speaking

2288.7 --> 2294.2799999999997
freak Christians and then you have

2291.64 --> 2296.14
modest Christians that actually don't

2294.28 --> 2298.78
really give a [ __ ] about priesthood

2296.14 --> 2301.48
power or anything or some kind of

2298.78 --> 2303.46
Spiritual Authority even

2301.48 --> 2306.4
over others

2303.46 --> 2308.7400000000002
they just try to do their best to be a

2306.4 --> 2311.5
good person and and be inspired by

2308.74 --> 2313.66
Christ right that's much more of a real

2311.5 --> 2317.5
Christian but those are not the people

2313.66 --> 2319.2999999999997
in control of these churches

2317.5 --> 2321.82
those aren't

2319.3 --> 2325.0
the good Christians people in control of

2321.82 --> 2327.28
the churches are demonic devil

2325.0 --> 2330.76
persecutors

2327.28 --> 2334.8590000000004
that lie and are pharisaic and that

2330.76 --> 2334.8590000000004
violate the teachings of Christ

2337.18 --> 2341.859
meanwhile pretending to lead it I mean I

2339.76 --> 2345.7000000000003
cannot think of a more pharisaic thing

2341.859 --> 2348.359
than that I mean I I'll take a a Jew

2345.7 --> 2351.64
that's just honestly hating on Christ

2348.359 --> 2357.2999999999997
over some pharisaic

2351.64 --> 2357.2999999999997
Christ violating double speaking scumbag

2362.079 --> 2367.1800000000003
what's the latest between Owen and gmob

2364.3 --> 2369.82
I don't know I'm not I'm getting kind of

2367.18 --> 2372.46
bored about it on Owens but he's getting

2369.82 --> 2373.96
other like so he's just I don't care I

2372.46 --> 2376.839
don't want to know about Jimbo anymore

2373.96 --> 2378.94
you can go [ __ ] himself

2376.839 --> 2380.68
I'm unsubscribing I don't want to have

2378.94 --> 2382.06
anything to do with him it's [ __ ]

2380.68 --> 2384.7
disgusting

2382.06 --> 2386.98
it's so bad what he does now

2384.7 --> 2389.98
I feel embarrassed for having associated

2386.98 --> 2392.02
with him in the past it's that bad just

2389.98 --> 2394.78
don't go there don't check out his

2392.02 --> 2400.24
channel it's [ __ ] gross

2394.78 --> 2403.78
it's gross it's [ __ ] and gross

2400.24 --> 2406.3799999999997
he's like an orthodox ashy aw

2403.78 --> 2406.38
okay

2406.96 --> 2410.98
keep that in mind if you're gonna check

2408.64 --> 2415.24
it out and you'll see what I mean he is

2410.98 --> 2418.2
an orthodox Ashley W now it's [ __ ]

2415.24 --> 2418.2
disgusting

2425.859 --> 2429.46
right so everything that I'm saying

2427.72 --> 2431.7999999999997
about oh Christians are [ __ ] up I'm

2429.46 --> 2433.42
not even talking about Jim Bob in a

2431.8 --> 2436.119
different I mean yeah he is a prime

2433.42 --> 2438.579
example of everything that I said

2436.119 --> 2441.1600000000003
it's not all about him it's in general

2438.579 --> 2443.1400000000003
there's a lot of those people out there

2441.16 --> 2446.8199999999997
huge

2443.14 --> 2450.04
swaths of people like that

2446.82 --> 2451.3
hundreds of thousands of people like

2450.04 --> 2453.579
that

2451.3 --> 2457.0600000000004
all gamma

2453.579 --> 2458.92
all unbearable all double speaking

2457.06 --> 2460.56
all hypocrites

2458.92 --> 2463.66
terrible

2460.56 --> 2465.4
they're out there they're finding each

2463.66 --> 2468.5989999999997
other and they're making other people's

2465.4 --> 2468.599
lives miserable

2471.339 --> 2475.06
what about met from Quantum of conscious

2473.44 --> 2479.7000000000003
math is cool

2475.06 --> 2479.7
but he's not a Christian in that sense

2483.579 --> 2492.76
I think that above anything he is

2488.14 --> 2492.7599999999998
a more real agnostic

2498.4 --> 2503.079
he is not a Christian and definitely not

2501.339 --> 2506.0789999999997
a devil persecutor

2503.079 --> 2508.7400000000002
definitely not like that

2506.079 --> 2508.7400000000002
so

2510.4 --> 2512.94
foreign

2513.599 --> 2518.26
with Matt

2515.44 --> 2520.66
other than that yeah he likes to dwell a

2518.26 --> 2523.119
little on this weird solipsistic inward

2520.66 --> 2525.46
spiral sometimes

2523.119 --> 2527.2000000000003
but

2525.46 --> 2529.599
I mean at least he's not getting

2527.2 --> 2532.859
possessed by some devil persecuting

2529.599 --> 2532.8590000000004
demon you know

2533.56 --> 2536.94
and he is funny too

2538.42 --> 2543.66
it's just funny little insights so yeah

2540.76 --> 2543.6600000000003
I like math

2547.859 --> 2553.48
do I agree with no Polaris is not

2551.98 --> 2555.88
anywhere

2553.48 --> 2558.16
it's a light a holographic light that

2555.88 --> 2560.02
doesn't have an actual position if you

2558.16 --> 2562.359
go there above the North Pole and you

2560.02 --> 2566.02
travel towards Polaris it's gonna

2562.359 --> 2569.619
disappear just like all the rest of it

2566.02 --> 2572.98
Polaris is not a literal thing in a

2569.619 --> 2575.26
literal position it's just angular

2572.98 --> 2580.119
yeah the GP

2575.26 --> 2582.94
is at that presumed to be North Pole the

2580.119 --> 2585.52
North Pole concept is based on it

2582.94 --> 2588.7200000000003
so that's it

2585.52 --> 2588.72
that's what that is

2590.8 --> 2596.079
but I don't even think I flat flat oh

2593.8 --> 2598.9
holics Anonymous I don't even think that

2596.079 --> 2601.8
they really reify it to be in a literal

2598.9 --> 2601.8
position like that

2602.68 --> 2607.359
also I don't know necessarily about the

2605.26 --> 2609.7000000000003
degrees of latitude

2607.359 --> 2612.04
I don't know what it exactly is all

2609.7 --> 2615.359
these numerical details it's they're

2612.04 --> 2615.359
kind of like slipping by

2618.76 --> 2622.599
I don't pay too much attention to exact

2621.46 --> 2625.5
numbers

2622.599 --> 2625.5
in that sense

2631.119 --> 2637.54
right

2632.74 --> 2640.66
but yeah I doubt they're not saying it's

2637.54 --> 2643.359
in the center above the North Pole

2640.66 --> 2646.06
because that immediately infers a disc

2643.359 --> 2648.22
and I don't think that anybody

2646.06 --> 2651.46
on the Flat Earth debate crew is going

2648.22 --> 2652.839
to roll out a sentence like that

2651.46 --> 2655.18
so don't know where you're getting this

2652.839 --> 2657.9
from maybe this is slipped out by

2655.18 --> 2657.8999999999996
mistake or something

2658.72 --> 2663.339
right but a center

2661.599 --> 2667.6800000000003
is nonsense

2663.339 --> 2667.68
that's immediately a disk reification

2668.859 --> 2674.22
who says the north foe is a point

2671.38 --> 2674.2200000000003
who says that

2685.78 --> 2690.4
right and and how would you even confirm

2688.24 --> 2694.1189999999997
that there is a singular point above

2690.4 --> 2695.7400000000002
which the GP of Polaris is is exactly

2694.119 --> 2697.839
there

2695.74 --> 2699.8799999999997
has that been physically confirmed or

2697.839 --> 2702.5789999999997
could you move east and west

2699.88 --> 2705.1800000000003
and it's still going to be there right

2702.579 --> 2705.1800000000003
above you

2705.4 --> 2708.06
right

2709.18 --> 2714.819
what do you think you're going to arrive

2711.22 --> 2717.22
at some point on ice and then oh this is

2714.819 --> 2721.2
the exact point where Polaris is above

2717.22 --> 2721.2
you oh really where's that

2723.88 --> 2726.9
when did that happen

2733.3 --> 2737.6800000000003
they use Polaris for Celestial

2735.46 --> 2740.2
navigation yeah

2737.68 --> 2743.2
I mean it's pretty good

2740.2 --> 2746.6189999999997
it's an exact unchanging

2743.2 --> 2749.2599999999998
angular point on the celestial sphere so

2746.619 --> 2752.44
yeah I mean Polaris is definitely going

2749.26 --> 2754.3
to be above you at that

2752.44 --> 2756.4
latitude

2754.3 --> 2759.4
right

2756.4 --> 2763.92
but who's to say that that Latitude is

2759.4 --> 2763.92
actually a point on the disk

2763.96 --> 2770.68
it's just further north and then you

2767.14 --> 2772.96
reach a certain latitude North where

2770.68 --> 2775.4199999999996
Polaris is above you

2772.96 --> 2777.94
but who's to say that that's a singular

2775.42 --> 2780.52
Point as soon as you evade from it you

2777.94 --> 2783.579
immediately see Polaris

2780.52 --> 2784.54
Arch back down again oh really where is

2783.579 --> 2787.3590000000004
that

2784.54 --> 2789.7
where's that I don't think that's exists

2787.359 --> 2791.68
okay

2789.7 --> 2793.54
think you can go east and west right

2791.68 --> 2795.64
when Polaris is right above you if you

2793.54 --> 2797.619
can even reach that point because you

2795.64 --> 2799.7999999999997
might not actually be able to reach that

2797.619 --> 2799.8
point

2800.92 --> 2807.52
the celestial mechanics might even start

2803.8 --> 2810.76
to become different if you go far enough

2807.52 --> 2814.119
North or South yeah I've speculated

2810.76 --> 2816.6600000000003
about this like six years ago

2814.119 --> 2816.6600000000003
foreign

2818.2 --> 2824.9199999999996
so as soon as you're gonna say oh

2820.839 --> 2825.88
Polaris is just exactly a GP above one

2824.92 --> 2829.5
point

2825.88 --> 2829.5
well where's the evidence for that

2830.619 --> 2835.0
there is no evidence for that the

2832.72 --> 2838.0
evidence that would definitely

2835.0 --> 2840.599
be there is that if you reach that

2838.0 --> 2840.599
Latitude

2840.64 --> 2845.98
that it will be above you

2844.06 --> 2848.2
but it's not going to be a point though

2845.98 --> 2849.46
that has not been proven that it's a

2848.2 --> 2852.22
point

2849.46 --> 2854.5
it's a Latitude where it's above you

2852.22 --> 2857.0789999999997
yeah that's the evidence that is there

2854.5 --> 2859.0
that is very consistent with all the

2857.079 --> 2861.2200000000003
functioning the Practical observable

2859.0 --> 2863.319
functioning of the celestial sphere As

2861.22 --> 2866.9199999999996
you move on the Earth

2863.319 --> 2868.9
yes if you move far enough North to a

2866.92 --> 2870.4
certain latitude then Polaris will be

2868.9 --> 2873.46
above you

2870.4 --> 2876.579
is that only gonna be One Singular point

2873.46 --> 2879.16
on Earth I don't think so there's no

2876.579 --> 2882.52
evidence that that is the case I think

2879.16 --> 2885.64
you could definitely move East or West

2882.52 --> 2887.38
and Polaris will stay right above you

2885.64 --> 2889.3799999999997
yeah

2887.38 --> 2893.76
not a disc

2889.38 --> 2893.76
not a literal disc

2899.56 --> 2904.0789999999997
ah started to follow yeah flat fella I

2901.78 --> 2904.079
know man

2904.18 --> 2907.96
five fellow

2905.8 --> 2909.819
it's good to see you again but yeah I

2907.96 --> 2912.579
mean flat fellow has been following me

2909.819 --> 2914.44
for a very long time

2912.579 --> 2916.0600000000004
and supported me in the past so thank

2914.44 --> 2918.579
you for that

2916.06 --> 2921.24
but yeah I did watch my appearance on

2918.579 --> 2924.2400000000002
Flat Earth potato and other hot potatoes

2921.24 --> 2927.819
recently but man

2924.24 --> 2931.06
what a difference because I was just

2927.819 --> 2933.4
I was basically just blabbering I was

2931.06 --> 2935.38
just rolling things out like like they

2933.4 --> 2937.839
were the they were the first time when I

2935.38 --> 2940.9
was on that show with Patricia I was

2937.839 --> 2942.94
like quickly confess it before I lose

2940.9 --> 2945.76
oversight over what I'm remembering

2942.94 --> 2948.52
that's kind of what it was so it

2945.76 --> 2950.92
I was actually kind of rambly

2948.52 --> 2953.14
and trying to convey like really

2950.92 --> 2956.319
complicated internal things that I've

2953.14 --> 2957.7599999999998
experienced but hastily

2956.319 --> 2959.68
hahaha

2957.76 --> 2960.4
so it was kind of weird watching that

2959.68 --> 2962.2
back

2960.4 --> 2965.14
but I mean that was like one of the

2962.2 --> 2967.96
first times that I could ever even that

2965.14 --> 2970.2999999999997
I felt like I was facing somebody that

2967.96 --> 2972.28
could actually halfway understand what I

2970.3 --> 2974.5600000000004
was saying if I would be talking about

2972.28 --> 2977.26
such things

2974.56 --> 2981.06
I think that Patricia was decently

2977.26 --> 2981.0600000000004
capable of following what I was saying

2988.42 --> 2994.14
yeah hey Adam making I don't know where

2990.64 --> 2994.14
flataholics is getting that from

2994.839 --> 3000.68
it's been a good growth to watch thank

2996.76 --> 3000.6800000000003
you flat fellow I really appreciate that

3001.859 --> 3006.66
and yes I have grown I've changed I've

3004.56 --> 3008.819
become better more focused

3006.66 --> 3011.52
better oversight

3008.819 --> 3014.16
more pronouncingly not good at math

3011.52 --> 3016.5
because I didn't know it back then that

3014.16 --> 3019.98
I wasn't actually that good at math

3016.5 --> 3022.8
it had just been a very long time

3019.98 --> 3025.68
now I know a lot much more about like

3022.8 --> 3028.1600000000003
how I'm functioning what my capabilities

3025.68 --> 3028.16
are

3028.56 --> 3033.54
and also how to compose myself as a

3032.52 --> 3037.079
person

3033.54 --> 3040.8
because yeah six seven years ago I

3037.079 --> 3043.02
didn't really know how to present myself

3040.8 --> 3044.94
all I was thinking is like there's no

3043.02 --> 3047.7
way that people in the outside world are

3044.94 --> 3050.839
gonna accept me for exactly who I am

3047.7 --> 3050.839
is bewildered

3052.44 --> 3057.7200000000003
so I had to hold a lot back in ways

3055.2 --> 3060.4199999999996
especially emotionally right

3057.72 --> 3062.819
and that pretty much changed at 82 when

3060.42 --> 3066.1800000000003
I first really unleashed the rage win

3062.819 --> 3070.52
and that's when I really started to show

3066.18 --> 3070.52
how I connect up on the inside more

3074.52 --> 3081.9
but man if you told me

3077.46 --> 3083.88
like eight years ago like hey Arwin in a

3081.9 --> 3087.059
few years you're gonna start a show that

3083.88 --> 3090.7200000000003
you're gonna do every day

3087.059 --> 3093.26
for at least four or five years I would

3090.72 --> 3097.0789999999997
have thought like you're insane

3093.26 --> 3100.3390000000004
like there's no way I could survive that

3097.079 --> 3100.3390000000004
yet here I am

3100.859 --> 3107.819
although the survival is still somewhat

3103.559 --> 3111.5400000000004
tricky considering the finances

3107.819 --> 3113.7
so I could really use support actually

3111.54 --> 3114.599
for anybody that can help me out with

3113.7 --> 3116.2799999999997
that

3114.599 --> 3118.079
I asked at the beginning of the show but

3116.28 --> 3119.94
nobody was really there at the start so

3118.079 --> 3122.099
but I really do need support or I'm

3119.94 --> 3126.68
gonna get hungry this weekend

3122.099 --> 3126.6800000000003
little bits help too anyway

3130.8 --> 3135.8590000000004
let's

3132.66 --> 3135.859
see how many are watching

3136.4 --> 3140.119
32. not bad

3144.839 --> 3150.92
Center often

3147.26 --> 3154.8590000000004
equatorial Mount alignments what

3150.92 --> 3157.2200000000003
I what okay Adam I don't follow what you

3154.859 --> 3157.22
just said

3162.0 --> 3168.92
no it doesn't flattaholics

3164.7 --> 3168.9199999999996
Celestial navigation does not

3170.339 --> 3177.119
rely on Polaris being in an exact point

3174.9 --> 3180.7200000000003
it doesn't do that

3177.119 --> 3185.52
when it relies is that Polaris is

3180.72 --> 3187.74
exactly above a specific latitude

3185.52 --> 3190.16
yeah

3187.74 --> 3192.66
a line

3190.16 --> 3196.2799999999997
I have the map

3192.66 --> 3201.54
we have the latitudes and the altitudes

3196.28 --> 3203.46
and the latitude is a line and when the

3201.54 --> 3207.0589999999997
nose Northern line

3203.46 --> 3210.359
is when Polaris is right above above

3207.059 --> 3213.3190000000004
that line not a point

3210.359 --> 3213.319
you're wrong

3216.96 --> 3221.04
also that would immediately prove that

3219.9 --> 3225.2400000000002
there is

3221.04 --> 3227.839
a circle Centric setup which there is no

3225.24 --> 3227.839
proof for

3227.94 --> 3233.579
it doesn't fit

3229.8 --> 3237.0
if you project the earth into a disk

3233.579 --> 3241.2000000000003
then it doesn't fit

3237.0 --> 3243.839
the north doesn't fit at the center you

3241.2 --> 3247.2
get it it doesn't fit

3243.839 --> 3250.38
it's not centered around the North Pole

3247.2 --> 3253.02
Polaris star point

3250.38 --> 3256.1400000000003
it's a line

3253.02 --> 3258.48
it's not a point it's a line

3256.14 --> 3260.8799999999997
yeah latitude is a line there's no

3258.48 --> 3263.48
latitude points there's only latitude

3260.88 --> 3263.48
lines

3263.64 --> 3268.819
all right

3265.619 --> 3268.819
check Skype where

3276.119 --> 3278.48
what

3282.72 --> 3289.14
I'm not seeing a message from you

3286.14 --> 3289.14
Adam

3291.599 --> 3297.96
it's very near the pole yeah keep

3294.059 --> 3303.44
reifying that dummy keep reifying that

3297.96 --> 3306.8
yeah Polaris is over the North Pole Line

3303.44 --> 3306.8
latitude line

3311.059 --> 3317.3
up yeah

3313.52 --> 3317.3
Polaris okay

3318.839 --> 3322.92
sure Adam

3320.76 --> 3325.1400000000003
I mean that's how it presents itself on

3322.92 --> 3327.9
the celestial sphere I know

3325.14 --> 3330.24
pretty sure though that after you reach

3327.9 --> 3332.52
if that's even physically possible the

3330.24 --> 3334.5
GP point of Polaris

3332.52 --> 3338.46
I'll bet you

3334.5 --> 3342.66
any amount of money or something else

3338.46 --> 3346.26
that you can move East and West and that

3342.66 --> 3348.839
Polaris remains above you

3346.26 --> 3352.6800000000003
yeah that's my claim

3348.839 --> 3354.42
that's my claim now I it can't literally

3352.68 --> 3356.819
prove that

3354.42 --> 3359.28
because I'm not there but I'm pretty

3356.819 --> 3362.52
sure that that is going to turn out to

3359.28 --> 3365.48
be the case so it's my prediction I

3362.52 --> 3369.18
predict yeah I'm not saying it is there

3365.48 --> 3372.18
I have the proof no no I'm just saying I

3369.18 --> 3373.859
predict you go to the North Pole Polaris

3372.18 --> 3376.2599999999998
directly above you

3373.859 --> 3379.5589999999997
yeah

3376.26 --> 3381.78
it's not going to be a GP point just one

3379.559 --> 3385.579
point where it's always above you no you

3381.78 --> 3385.579
will be able to move east and west

3387.059 --> 3393.079
and then Polaris will stay above you

3389.88 --> 3393.079
that's my prediction

3397.04 --> 3401.24
hello LSG good to see you

3404.46 --> 3409.319
right so yeah hey look if you're like

3407.099 --> 3411.119
just think about it Polaris is directly

3409.319 --> 3413.96
above you and you're surrounded by these

3411.119 --> 3417.359
Stars yeah they still keep rotating

3413.96 --> 3419.099
apparently around the GP point of

3417.359 --> 3423.72
Polaris

3419.099 --> 3426.3590000000004
yeah but the sea anywhere on Earth if

3423.72 --> 3430.7999999999997
you have a certain latitude and you move

3426.359 --> 3433.74
exactly East or West guess what

3430.8 --> 3435.78
it's not changing the celestial thing is

3433.74 --> 3437.64
not changing it's just oh you move East

3435.78 --> 3440.1600000000003
or West well the rotation is either

3437.64 --> 3442.98
going to speed up a bit more or slow

3440.16 --> 3445.319
down in relation to you

3442.98 --> 3447.72
yeah that's what happens and I think

3445.319 --> 3452.0589999999997
that that happens

3447.72 --> 3452.0589999999997
the North Pole just as much

3452.28 --> 3458.5400000000004
you can move East and West at the North

3454.859 --> 3462.0589999999997
Pole and Polaris will remain above you

3458.54 --> 3465.14
simply the celestial sphere will rotate

3462.059 --> 3469.38
more or less as you move East or West

3465.14 --> 3472.02
while Polaris remains above you this is

3469.38 --> 3473.6400000000003
my arwenian prediction official

3472.02 --> 3477.2
yeah

3473.64 --> 3477.2
I'll put it in the title

3477.48 --> 3482.28
keep repeating the same garbage over and

3479.94 --> 3483.839
over again you're reifying numpty dip

3482.28 --> 3486.0
[ __ ]

3483.839 --> 3488.2799999999997
just stupid soccer counts why don't you

3486.0 --> 3491.16
just [ __ ] off

3488.28 --> 3493.44
all of you just [ __ ] off

3491.16 --> 3496.0989999999997
reefying garbage

3493.44 --> 3496.099
[ __ ] off

3501.24 --> 3506.819
yeah an official Armenian prediction

3503.52 --> 3509.94
that's right because I want people to

3506.819 --> 3513.2599999999998
stick that to me so they can like spend

3509.94 --> 3513.26
another 20 30 years

3518.94 --> 3523.7400000000002
30 years

3520.2 --> 3526.4399999999996
oh yeah yeah we we did another measuring

3523.74 --> 3529.6189999999997
tour oh yeah guess what [ __ ] Arwin

3526.44 --> 3532.26
was right yeah while you were bullying

3529.619 --> 3535.619
and nagging and whining for [ __ ] 30

3532.26 --> 3538.5
years guess what turns out our win was

3535.619 --> 3540.98
[ __ ] right [ __ ]

3538.5 --> 3540.98
okay

3541.26 --> 3545.5200000000004
there you go

3542.52 --> 3545.52
foreign

3548.01 --> 3551.139
[Applause]

3581.1 --> 3584.33
[Music]

3595.46 --> 3598.94
make you squirt

3600.359 --> 3605.0989999999997
yeah hey hey why is a trigger why is it

3603.359 --> 3608.04
triggered when people are numpty

3605.099 --> 3609.6600000000003
[ __ ] that just regurgitate garbage

3608.04 --> 3612.0
and they don't know what the [ __ ]

3609.66 --> 3614.46
they're saying it triggers me because it

3612.0 --> 3616.94
just shows you how [ __ ] [ __ ]

3614.46 --> 3622.38
people are

3616.94 --> 3627.319
I mean dogs are more [ __ ] intelligent

3622.38 --> 3629.94
than you people yeah dogs are more

3627.319 --> 3631.38
intelligent than you

3629.94 --> 3635.7200000000003
okay

3631.38 --> 3635.7200000000003
yeah I find that kind of frustrating

3639.24 --> 3648.68
man it's snowing again by the way

3642.54 --> 3648.68
big flakes big big ass snowflakes

3668.94 --> 3675.0
yep so hey the predictions is there let

3672.0 --> 3676.16
let the numpty [ __ ] squirt as much as

3675.0 --> 3678.299
they like

3676.16 --> 3680.7
doesn't know what he's talking about oh

3678.299 --> 3683.64
yeah leave the comments go squirt for me

3680.7 --> 3685.5
again you [ __ ] retards gotta leave a

3683.64 --> 3688.02
combo or he doesn't know what he's

3685.5 --> 3690.24
talking about he doesn't understand I

3688.02 --> 3692.819
[ __ ] well do understand yeah you're

3690.24 --> 3694.14
[ __ ] [ __ ] and I know what I'm

3692.819 --> 3697.92
talking about

3694.14 --> 3701.22
I can actually make a prediction

3697.92 --> 3704.7000000000003
about something that you can barely even

3701.22 --> 3709.5789999999997
grasp in your [ __ ] stupid little less

3704.7 --> 3709.5789999999997
intelligent than dog's head okay

3710.52 --> 3713.96
so keep squirting

3714.059 --> 3721.88
keep writing your whiny little comments

3716.7 --> 3721.8799999999997
about Arwen burning oppositional views

3725.839 --> 3730.98
you don't have a view you just

3728.22 --> 3734.3999999999996
regurgitate garbage nonsense that you've

3730.98 --> 3738.0
been conditioned with like a [ __ ] like

3734.4 --> 3740.7000000000003
less than intelligent dog

3738.0 --> 3744.599
yeah you're like a lassie dog really

3740.7 --> 3747.359
[ __ ] dumb dog yeah Lassie that those

3744.599 --> 3749.46
types of dogs the Lassie dog are really

3747.359 --> 3753.119
[ __ ] dumb that's where you're at

3749.46 --> 3754.26
Ballers these whiny squirty [ __ ] in

3753.119 --> 3756.299
chat

3754.26 --> 3761.579
you're that stupid

3756.299 --> 3764.46
as a lassie dog really [ __ ] dumb

3761.579 --> 3766.7400000000002
yeah those dogs are actually dumb enough

3764.46 --> 3768.48
to get themselves killed because they're

3766.74 --> 3771.0589999999997
that [ __ ] stupid

3768.48 --> 3774.26
you are that stupid as well

3771.059 --> 3774.26
so leave a comment

3776.819 --> 3783.18
did I have any pet dogs growing up nope

3779.7 --> 3787.04
no dogs only cats lots of cats

3783.18 --> 3787.04
loving cats I love cats

3788.48 --> 3796.02
I do appreciate certain types of dogs

3792.079 --> 3798.54
mainly the dogs that shut the [ __ ] up

3796.02 --> 3800.7
because I do not like bug dogs that

3798.54 --> 3804.92
always keep barking and [ __ ] I can't

3800.7 --> 3804.9199999999996
stand it find it very annoying

3807.74 --> 3811.9799999999996
yes yes but

3812.099 --> 3817.5
I'm talking about the actual dog breed

3814.74 --> 3820.74
yeah did you know that Lassie

3817.5 --> 3823.859
that that was like six dogs that all

3820.74 --> 3826.74
each learn one [ __ ] trick because

3823.859 --> 3829.02
they're so stupid that they couldn't

3826.74 --> 3831.72
find one of those types of dogs that

3829.02 --> 3834.859
could learn all those tricks real

3831.72 --> 3834.859
official truth

3835.02 --> 3837.5
yeah

3837.9 --> 3841.7400000000002
right

3839.099 --> 3844.88
but very funny remark though thank you

3841.74 --> 3844.8799999999997
for that for reminding us

3852.0 --> 3855.599
I mean a real Lassie dog you know what a

3854.099 --> 3857.94
real Lassie dog would have done when

3855.599 --> 3858.9
Timmy got stuck in the well they were

3857.94 --> 3861.839
just

3858.9 --> 3864.78
sat there above the well maybe bark some

3861.839 --> 3867.72
and then just sit there and do nothing

3864.78 --> 3869.88
and then maybe go home and then quickly

3867.72 --> 3872.2799999999997
forget that that even happened

3869.88 --> 3874.619
because those dogs are dumb

3872.28 --> 3876.7200000000003
and they don't have a very good memory

3874.619 --> 3878.28
either

3876.72 --> 3881.04
anyway

3878.28 --> 3885.48
so that's what I'm equating

3881.04 --> 3887.22
certain gamma commenters too when

3885.48 --> 3888.96
they're gonna respond to the title of

3887.22 --> 3891.18
this show

3888.96 --> 3893.579
because they are going to be very dumb

3891.18 --> 3895.319
rolling out standard conditioning

3893.579 --> 3897.599
[ __ ]

3895.319 --> 3899.46
proving that they literally don't

3897.599 --> 3901.88
understand what the [ __ ] they even

3899.46 --> 3901.88
learned

3906.079 --> 3911.579
steamy was stuck in a well that never

3908.22 --> 3914.16
happened what Mandela effect dude I

3911.579 --> 3915.38
never even watched that show I like

3914.16 --> 3919.0789999999997
watched

3915.38 --> 3924.319
Lassie like a few times when I was a

3919.079 --> 3924.319
preteen and I found it really boring

3924.599 --> 3929.2200000000003
I'd much rather watch Skippy the Bush

3927.359 --> 3932.7599999999998
Kangaroo who wasn't a kangaroo but

3929.22 --> 3934.98
actually a wallaby I like that show more

3932.76 --> 3937.079
freaking Lassie

3934.98 --> 3940.02
I mean I could see how stupid that dog

3937.079 --> 3941.94
is it's just like movie Magic pretending

3940.02 --> 3944.28
this dog is a genius when it's [ __ ]

3941.94 --> 3946.079
[ __ ] dog you could see it's a [ __ ]

3944.28 --> 3949.079
dog

3946.079 --> 3949.079
anyway

3952.2 --> 3956.839
I'm using a lot of swear words today

3958.74 --> 3963.5989999999997
there are many skippies as well yeah

3960.78 --> 3966.559
okay but that's a freaking wallaby iron

3963.599 --> 3966.559
26.

3967.2 --> 3970.64
it's a wild animal

3971.88 --> 3977.94
it's pretty special that they were even

3974.16 --> 3981.0
able to do anything with a wallaby in

3977.94 --> 3983.7000000000003
the first place in movies

3981.0 --> 3986.52
it's not a kangaroo it's a wallaby

3983.7 --> 3987.7799999999997
they call it the Bush Kangaroo and it's

3986.52 --> 3991.38
a wallaby

3987.78 --> 3994.38
it was always very annoying

3991.38 --> 3996.1800000000003
to Australians the Skippy the Bush

3994.38 --> 3998.099
Kangaroo series because it's like but

3996.18 --> 3999.8999999999996
that's not okay

3998.099 --> 4002.119
yeah that's not okay

3999.9 --> 4006.38
I can't say it in Australia

4002.119 --> 4008.7200000000003
like but I know kangaroo it's a wallaby

4006.38 --> 4011.02
why does they they have to do it all

4008.72 --> 4011.02
wrong

4011.24 --> 4013.9599999999996
you know

4014.539 --> 4019.3390000000004
okay slightly better Australian accent

4016.819 --> 4022.819
but I I even remember back then that

4019.339 --> 4026.18
Australians were agitated

4022.819 --> 4028.9
because Skippy is in the kangaroo so

4026.18 --> 4031.7
wallaby why can't they just get it right

4028.9 --> 4034.7000000000003
anyway I don't know why we're moving on

4031.7 --> 4038.72
to this subject let's go back to Polaris

4034.7 --> 4041.24
and how it isn't a point over Earth

4038.72 --> 4043.22
yeah

4041.24 --> 4047.0589999999997
it's a line

4043.22 --> 4049.9399999999996
the GP is a line

4047.059 --> 4052.88
it's above you everywhere

4049.94 --> 4053.96
at that Latitude

4052.88 --> 4056.42
yeah

4053.96 --> 4059.119
my prediction I haven't physically

4056.42 --> 4061.2200000000003
personally confirmed that

4059.119 --> 4063.38
nor do I look forward to actually

4061.22 --> 4066.5589999999997
physically confirming that because it's

4063.38 --> 4068.839
freaking cold at the North Pole in that

4066.559 --> 4071.1800000000003
region in that Latitude so

4068.839 --> 4073.599
but I'm pretty damn sure that that is

4071.18 --> 4073.5989999999997
the case

4074.359 --> 4080.42
and there is no confirmed measured proof

4077.599 --> 4083.2400000000002
that it is an actual point there's been

4080.42 --> 4085.16
no tests like oh oh we found it we found

4083.24 --> 4087.2
the North Pole okay let's move East and

4085.16 --> 4089.98
West let's see if it's still going to be

4087.2 --> 4093.6189999999997
there yeah guess what

4089.98 --> 4095.72
no no registry of that

4093.619 --> 4100.1
no report

4095.72 --> 4102.139999999999
no test officially done no they just

4100.1 --> 4103.819
went there and said this is the North

4102.14 --> 4106.9400000000005
Pole

4103.819 --> 4108.679
and that's it that's all they did they

4106.94 --> 4110.599999999999
didn't test anything about it they

4108.679 --> 4113.2390000000005
didn't confirm it was actually a point

4110.6 --> 4114.759
they just here it is that's the North

4113.239 --> 4118.0
Pole

4114.759 --> 4118.0
that's it

4125.239 --> 4130.12
Hollies

4126.679 --> 4130.12
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4137.02 --> 4140.129000000001
[Music]

4148.4 --> 4151.12
dude

4159.38 --> 4165.039
wait what

4161.88 --> 4165.039
[Music]

4165.259 --> 4170.779
okay well maybe other type of Collie

4168.679 --> 4174.4400000000005
dogs

4170.779 --> 4176.779
but like that specific type

4174.44 --> 4178.879999999999
I think it's a rough collie

4176.779 --> 4182.7390000000005
don't know why the hell the pictures are

4178.88 --> 4182.7390000000005
just blacking out weird

4186.02 --> 4190.88
but uh no I don't know what the hell

4188.6 --> 4193.58
you're talking about but that Lassie

4190.88 --> 4196.1
type dog they're really [ __ ] stupid

4193.58 --> 4198.28
they're not smart I don't know what the

4196.1 --> 4200.84
hell you're saying why are you

4198.28 --> 4203.38
contradicting reality again George

4200.84 --> 4203.38
Sanford

4206.48 --> 4211.54
they're not smart at all they don't

4208.64 --> 4211.54
learn tricks

4212.42 --> 4217.28
I mean yeah they might be good at

4214.52 --> 4219.320000000001
hurting right getting all dominant

4217.28 --> 4221.96
against sheep and all that is that

4219.32 --> 4224.36
intelligence

4221.96 --> 4226.64
or is that just a good Instinct I never

4224.36 --> 4229.46
said they had no good Instinct at it

4226.64 --> 4230.42
whatsoever I mean their dog breed for a

4229.46 --> 4234.199
reason

4230.42 --> 4237.5
but they were infamously dumb

4234.199 --> 4239.78
as in not complex thinking

4237.5 --> 4242.78
over simple

4239.78 --> 4242.78
short-sighted

4244.04 --> 4247.159
so I don't know what the hell you're

4245.6 --> 4249.34
talking about George Sanford but you're

4247.159 --> 4249.339999999999
wrong

4251.5 --> 4257.48
extremely smart

4254.54 --> 4260.98
okay well they're notoriously dumb you

4257.48 --> 4260.98
might have had some exception

4261.199 --> 4265.719
so I don't know what the [ __ ] you're

4263.239 --> 4265.718999999999
talking about

4266.9 --> 4271.78
what can cats do what can't cats do

4274.1 --> 4279.1990000000005
I mean with cats it's not about what

4276.679 --> 4281.84
they can do it's about

4279.199 --> 4285.159
can you make them do anything and the

4281.84 --> 4285.159000000001
answer is usually no

4297.44 --> 4302.239
Skippy was an Eastern gray kangaroo no

4300.08 --> 4305.84
it was a wallaby

4302.239 --> 4309.58
a really small type of kangaroo

4305.84 --> 4309.58
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4311.179 --> 4320.62
dude it was freaking TV items about it

4316.52 --> 4324.38
TV items on the television

4320.62 --> 4325.82
discussing how he wasn't a kangaroo but

4324.38 --> 4329.56
a wallaby

4325.82 --> 4329.5599999999995
so what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4333.679 --> 4336.9400000000005
what do you mean nope

4343.219 --> 4348.7390000000005
at the TVs yeah I know I know it

4346.52 --> 4351.7390000000005
went like that

4348.739 --> 4355.0599999999995
and it annoyed people because it isn't a

4351.739 --> 4355.0599999999995
kangaroo it's a wallaby

4356.56 --> 4360.38
kangaroo what did they rename the

4358.94 --> 4364.178999999999
wallaby or something

4360.38 --> 4364.179
what the [ __ ] is going on here

4371.96 --> 4380.179
what the hell is up with this [ __ ]

4374.719 --> 4382.64
picture [ __ ] why isn't Google showing it

4380.179 --> 4385.42
the [ __ ] is going on is anybody else

4382.64 --> 4385.42
having this [ __ ]

4386.12 --> 4390.219
the pictures are being blotted out

4392.06 --> 4395.360000000001
weird

4393.98 --> 4398.178999999999
yeah

4395.36 --> 4400.219
but let me compare

4398.179 --> 4403.76
what you said

4400.219 --> 4405.92
eastern gray kangaroo

4403.76 --> 4408.88
let's let's compare that

4405.92 --> 4408.88
image wise

4415.76 --> 4421.84
what the hell is why isn't it showing

4418.76 --> 4421.84
the [ __ ] pictures

4426.98 --> 4429.879999999999
uh

4432.739 --> 4438.259999999999
wow they look almost identical for

4435.8 --> 4440.78
starters wallabies and these eastern

4438.26 --> 4443.4400000000005
gray kangaroos

4440.78 --> 4443.44
but

4444.8 --> 4448.96
yeah I mean I can't tell them apart

4449.48 --> 4453.379999999999
except the eastern gray kangaroos seem

4451.64 --> 4456.58
to have a little bigger

4453.38 --> 4456.58
once I mean

4457.1 --> 4463.900000000001
wallabies are like smaller right they

4461.0 --> 4463.9
stay kind of small

4466.1 --> 4470.3
right they say they are members of the

4468.56 --> 4473.02
kangaroo

4470.3 --> 4473.02
Clan

4476.36 --> 4480.679
but I don't see a difference between a

4478.46 --> 4482.179
wallaby and an Eastern gray kangaroo

4480.679 --> 4484.719
really I don't really see the difference

4482.179 --> 4484.719
so

4486.58 --> 4491.86
only okay thank you a man like me right

4497.06 --> 4502.54
three different kangaroos yeah

4499.159 --> 4502.54
but wallabies though

4505.94 --> 4512.0
I mean you're not gonna [ __ ] around with

4508.28 --> 4513.08
things that I've like really memorized

4512.0 --> 4516.44
yeah

4513.08 --> 4519.08
Skippy was a wallaby it was an entire

4516.44 --> 4521.12
thing it was like people were annoyed

4519.08 --> 4522.62
about how it's called the Bush Kangaroo

4521.12 --> 4525.08
when it was a wallaby you're not gonna

4522.62 --> 4527.239
tell me oh no it's not a wallaby go [ __ ]

4525.08 --> 4530.0599999999995
yourself I don't care if you live in

4527.239 --> 4534.32
Australia you're wrong it was on the

4530.06 --> 4537.7390000000005
freaking television being rolled out

4534.32 --> 4541.28
in conversation talking shows

4537.739 --> 4547.839999999999
like in the freaking 90s and 80s about

4541.28 --> 4547.84
how he was not a kangaroo but a wallaby

4556.12 --> 4561.5
[Music]

4558.5 --> 4561.5
anyway

4577.76 --> 4582.679
through noisy oh yeah they did that

4579.86 --> 4584.36
stupid thing right with his hands like

4582.679 --> 4587.659
these stupid

4584.36 --> 4590.599999999999
like obviously puppeted arms of the

4587.659 --> 4593.62
wallaby and like it was really silly the

4590.6 --> 4593.620000000001
way they made it look too

4594.44 --> 4598.58
you have to defend Australia you're not

4596.54 --> 4600.38
dumb yeah but you're wrong though

4598.58 --> 4603.5199999999995
because it isn't this thing you're

4600.38 --> 4603.52
talking it's a wallaby

4609.199 --> 4613.46
to use a wallaby and then call it a kind

4611.42 --> 4617.08
yeah that's cute

4613.46 --> 4617.08
but it was a wallaby

4625.82 --> 4630.28
ah there you go thank you man like me

4627.8 --> 4630.28
yeah

4630.62 --> 4636.32
several wallabies that's right no but

4632.78 --> 4637.82
usually a TV series that have animals as

4636.32 --> 4639.139999999999
a protagonist they have multiple

4637.82 --> 4641.12
versions of them because they always

4639.14 --> 4643.64
want to make the animals looks much

4641.12 --> 4645.739
smarter than they really are

4643.64 --> 4648.88
so yeah it's logical that they have

4645.739 --> 4648.879999999999
multiple animals for it

4656.42 --> 4662.5
it's doing great

4659.02 --> 4662.5
of the series

4664.58 --> 4669.0199999999995
okay well that's conflicting information

4667.88 --> 4671.96
then

4669.02 --> 4676.219
so which one is it so there's apparently

4671.96 --> 4678.56
now two swaths of data about that series

4676.219 --> 4681.02
and one says it's a wallaby that's the

4678.56 --> 4681.6990000000005
one I was confronted with but no

4681.02 --> 4684.9800000000005
no

4681.699 --> 4686.379999999999
it's not it's normal to be for some

4684.98 --> 4689.08
[ __ ]

4686.38 --> 4692.659000000001
Mandela [ __ ] and reason or whatever

4689.08 --> 4696.0199999999995
no it's it's the other one

4692.659 --> 4697.759999999999
yeah dude I don't care anymore

4696.02 --> 4700.46
I don't care what the [ __ ] they say

4697.76 --> 4702.62
about it I always learn it was a wallaby

4700.46 --> 4705.44
it was a whole thing that's the only

4702.62 --> 4708.199
reason I even [ __ ] remember it okay

4705.44 --> 4710.719
it's the only reason I even remember

4708.199 --> 4713.419999999999
anything about it because I thought it

4710.719 --> 4715.46
was kind of a stupid series really I

4713.42 --> 4718.84
mean it was not as stupid as Lassie but

4715.46 --> 4718.84
it was still pretty damn stupid

4719.78 --> 4724.4
yeah it was a wallaby that was the whole

4722.719 --> 4727.96
thing that's the only thing that made me

4724.4 --> 4727.96
remember it in the first place

4728.5 --> 4734.92
yeah shut up iron 26 I don't care man

4731.659 --> 4734.92
just leave it alone

4737.78 --> 4742.46
wallaby is technically a kangaroo so

4740.239 --> 4744.0199999999995
stop whining about it

4742.46 --> 4746.0
please

4744.02 --> 4747.860000000001
yeah and yeah I'm talking back at myself

4746.0 --> 4749.3
as well I'm gonna stop whining about it

4747.86 --> 4752.62
I don't want to talk about freaking

4749.3 --> 4752.62
Kangaroos and wallabies

4756.219 --> 4759.46
thank you

4760.159 --> 4764.259999999999
yeah now you're just talking [ __ ]

4770.48 --> 4773.379999999999
the [ __ ]

4784.58 --> 4787.12
all right

4787.94 --> 4791.379999999999
big rabbits with long

4800.12 --> 4803.2699999999995
[Music]

4813.1 --> 4817.96
[Music]

4814.64 --> 4817.96
right anyway

4821.6 --> 4827.06
Polaris will stay above you when you

4824.78 --> 4828.98
move East or West at the North Pole

4827.06 --> 4831.14
title of my show

4828.98 --> 4832.879999999999
that's the real subject that's the real

4831.14 --> 4834.8
thing that we're talking about here on

4832.88 --> 4839.7390000000005
this show

4834.8 --> 4839.7390000000005
and not wallabies and Lassie dogs

4848.62 --> 4852.76
oh steam traveler what

4868.76 --> 4873.860000000001
oh wow Skippy to push what's from the

4872.0 --> 4877.12
70s I didn't even know it was from the

4873.86 --> 4877.12
70s makes sense though

4877.34 --> 4881.14
because of the film quality

4881.239 --> 4885.699
but yeah they played it a lot in the 80s

4886.34 --> 4892.2390000000005
on the television

4888.56 --> 4892.2390000000005
Dutch television channels

4919.28 --> 4923.54
foreign

4920.719 --> 4925.64
wait

4923.54 --> 4928.239
I think what's going I think I know

4925.64 --> 4932.06
what's going on here

4928.239 --> 4935.12
they called Skippy

4932.06 --> 4938.2390000000005
like in the series

4935.12 --> 4940.64
in the scaries he is an Eastern gray

4938.239 --> 4944.0
kangaroo

4940.64 --> 4949.280000000001
but the actual species that's playing

4944.0 --> 4953.32
this eastern gray kangaroo is a wallaby

4949.28 --> 4953.32
I think I see what's going on now

4953.78 --> 4961.219
so the character Skippy is an Eastern

4957.98 --> 4963.62
gray kangaroo but the actual species

4961.219 --> 4967.1
that is playing that eastern gray

4963.62 --> 4969.88
kangaroo is a wallaby I think I finally

4967.1 --> 4969.88
figured it out

4979.64 --> 4984.08
anyway yeah I got that from the wikileak

4981.8 --> 4986.42
it just immediately stood out to me

4984.08 --> 4988.88
like Skippy the show's namesake start is

4986.42 --> 4990.92
a female eastern gray kangaroo who is

4988.88 --> 4992.659000000001
befriended in 90 right so that's

4990.92 --> 4996.14
describing

4992.659 --> 4999.259999999999
the setting in the series doesn't say

4996.14 --> 5001.179
that that creature is actually an

4999.26 --> 5004.1990000000005
Eastern gray kangaroo

5001.179 --> 5004.1990000000005
doesn't say that

5008.739 --> 5011.739
hmm

5014.5 --> 5020.26
oh we were dropping it yeah yeah but now

5017.32 --> 5023.759999999999
I'm just correcting you again

5020.26 --> 5023.76
because I figured it out

5024.04 --> 5032.199
can we please skip be past Skippy

5028.12 --> 5036.42
okay we can Skippy past Skippy

5032.199 --> 5036.419999999999
right but I mean I fixed it anyway

5037.12 --> 5041.199
figured it out he's it's just really

5039.64 --> 5043.84
weird though like why would they take

5041.199 --> 5047.82
some species and then make it play like

5043.84 --> 5047.82
it's another species that's just weird

5051.4 --> 5056.799999999999
from a exact norc pole you can only yeah

5054.58 --> 5059.08
oh oh really

5056.8 --> 5061.719
well that that works on a globe for sure

5059.08 --> 5064.42
or on a reified disc Earth which Earth

5061.719 --> 5068.02
isn't Godzilla

5064.42 --> 5073.56
right the thing is is the North Pole

5068.02 --> 5076.84
point is a concept it's only a concept

5073.56 --> 5079.38
derived from the presupposition of a

5076.84 --> 5079.38
spare Earth

5079.54 --> 5084.28
I don't think the North Pole is a point

5082.3 --> 5086.9800000000005
at all

5084.28 --> 5089.679
I think it is a latitude

5086.98 --> 5092.799999999999
and it is effectively a line and Polaris

5089.679 --> 5097.26
will be directly above you as you move

5092.8 --> 5097.26
east or west on that latitude line

5098.98 --> 5102.599999999999
what are you talking about

5105.94 --> 5111.879999999999
two I just compared it iron to any six I

5109.84 --> 5115.32
just compared the head

5111.88 --> 5115.32
they're not that different

5118.12 --> 5125.199
so what are you talking about

5121.179 --> 5127.06
they look almost identical

5125.199 --> 5128.86
I think the wallaby is a little smaller

5127.06 --> 5131.320000000001
right

5128.86 --> 5132.82
so yeah you are done you don't know what

5131.32 --> 5135.159
the [ __ ] you're talking about I don't

5132.82 --> 5137.82
know why you insist on this [ __ ] but

5135.159 --> 5137.82
you were wrong

5143.02 --> 5149.52
yeah and a wallaby is a kangaroo

5146.62 --> 5149.5199999999995
just for the record

5163.659 --> 5166.138999999999
right

5169.659 --> 5171.719
okay

5186.82 --> 5191.44
all right so I describe those kangaroos

5189.04 --> 5194.0199999999995
but they don't mention the exact species

5191.44 --> 5198.419999999999
even in the wiki

5194.02 --> 5198.42
they're not mentioning the exact species

5210.42 --> 5216.12
nope it's not in there

5213.28 --> 5216.12
doesn't say

5217.179 --> 5221.04
damn this is a big Wiki

5233.32 --> 5239.86
yeah well look if you want to stop the

5236.26 --> 5242.1990000000005
Skippy talk then make iron 26 stop

5239.86 --> 5245.219
make him stop repeat regurgitating

5242.199 --> 5245.219
something that's wrong

5248.98 --> 5255.659
it doesn't say even in the wiki the

5251.739 --> 5255.659
exact species of

5255.76 --> 5263.8
of kangaroo that that Skippy were

5258.6 --> 5265.54
escapee actors escapee wallabies I've

5263.8 --> 5268.360000000001
heard however that they were definitely

5265.54 --> 5270.54
wallabies but I was in the 80s I heard

5268.36 --> 5270.54
that

5273.58 --> 5276.36
where

5276.58 --> 5281.219
stuffed one will that's messed up

5281.739 --> 5285.699
it's doing great where where are you

5283.6 --> 5288.659000000001
seeing this Adam Aiken where the [ __ ]

5285.699 --> 5288.659
are you reading that

5290.679 --> 5293.159
where

5294.159 --> 5297.12
where is it

5305.8 --> 5311.1990000000005
I'm scrolling through the entire

5307.659 --> 5314.199
freaking wiki page which huge and it

5311.199 --> 5316.86
doesn't say that so where the [ __ ] are

I don't know

5361.179 --> 5367.8
I'm not I'm not even seeing it

5364.54 --> 5367.8
why does it say that

5374.62 --> 5378.04

that's that information is not on the

5378.04 --> 5383.28
website you link me

the [ __ ]

5392.56 --> 5397.7390000000005
the fan website yeah so not reliable

5395.44 --> 5397.739

5399.52 --> 5404.639
and it doesn't say it I mean you said

5402.4 --> 5404.638999999999

5431.98 --> 5436.178999999999
yeah

5433.48 --> 5438.9
I'm search barring

5436.179 --> 5438.9

5446.199 --> 5451.138999999999
oh

5448.54 --> 5451.139
where is that

5451.6 --> 5454.7390000000005

5466.84 --> 5472.32
okay fine so this fan website says that

5473.08 --> 5479.58
right okay I guess uh I guess it's not

5475.78 --> 5479.58
just never gonna be resolved then

5482.98 --> 5487.299999999999
try this differently because it's just

5485.139 --> 5490.26
pissing me off I mean this whole entire

5487.3 --> 5491.400000000001
thing is pissing me off

5490.26 --> 5494.79
[Music]

5491.4 --> 5494.79
[Applause]

5494.92 --> 5497.38
dude

5496.28 --> 5499.92
[Music]

5497.38 --> 5499.92
foreign

5524.94 --> 5530.5599999999995
wallaby called Skippy but that's not the

5527.739 --> 5532.718999999999
from the series

5530.56 --> 5535.2390000000005
this is weird man I I don't know anymore

5532.719 --> 5538.0
maybe maybe I just

5535.239 --> 5540.459999999999
had complete misinformation then I don't

5538.0 --> 5543.1
know why I would think it's a wallaby

5540.46 --> 5546.58
then if it isn't a wallaby why the [ __ ]

5543.1 --> 5548.26
did I even see it on TV people saying oh

5546.58 --> 5550.239
it's an issue because it's not actually

5548.26 --> 5553.62
a kangaroo it's a wallaby why the [ __ ]

5550.239 --> 5553.62
did I even see that then

5564.76 --> 5570.719
this is just [ __ ] annoying why the

5567.52 --> 5570.719
[ __ ] did I see that then

5571.659 --> 5576.46
okay I'm dropping it okay it's not a

5574.3 --> 5578.4400000000005
[ __ ] wallaby I'll just have to erase

5576.46 --> 5581.44
something from my mind that's been there

5578.44 --> 5584.86
for 30 years then

5581.44 --> 5587.32
okay it's a [ __ ] Bush Kangaroo

5584.86 --> 5589.86
whatever the [ __ ] it is I don't care

5587.32 --> 5592.78
anymore I apparently have a memory

5589.86 --> 5595.54
that's just wrong

5592.78 --> 5598.0599999999995
just a rollout memory or the people that

5595.54 --> 5600.94
were telling me that at the time even on

5598.06 --> 5602.679
television were just wrong that could be

5600.94 --> 5604.239
too if you're very young and you're

5602.679 --> 5605.8
seeing something being said on

5604.239 --> 5608.678999999999
television you're not gonna assume that

5605.8 --> 5610.659000000001
they're gonna be wrong so maybe I just

5608.679 --> 5612.82
saw a bunch of bullshitters and they

5610.659 --> 5614.86
insisted it's a wallaby and it's just

5612.82 --> 5616.299999999999
not true and I got fooled by that that

5614.86 --> 5619.0599999999995
could be too

5616.3 --> 5621.639
it could be that too makes me really

5619.06 --> 5623.280000000001
[ __ ] pissed off though because how

5621.639 --> 5626.56
the [ __ ] am I gonna

5623.28 --> 5630.12
rely on any [ __ ] memory from the past

5626.56 --> 5630.120000000001
if the [ __ ] is just wrong

5643.12 --> 5650.28
yeah I guess so steamy traveler I'm just

5646.239 --> 5650.28
really [ __ ] annoyed

5652.659 --> 5655.659
foreign

5656.04 --> 5661.54
the [ __ ] would I think it's a wallaby

5659.08 --> 5664.84
then why was that rammed in my head

5661.54 --> 5667.9
actively who the [ __ ] did that to me

5664.84 --> 5671.139
who was lying to me then

5667.9 --> 5673.5
what [ __ ] lied to me when I was

5671.139 --> 5673.5
a kid

5680.38 --> 5687.78
yeah Ancient Aliens was a 90s thing this

5683.26 --> 5687.780000000001
is like in the 80s in the early 80s

5692.139 --> 5699.639
God damn it

5695.28 --> 5703.38
God [ __ ] damn it

5699.639 --> 5703.38
I hate it when it happens

5707.91 --> 5710.979
[Music]

5718.179 --> 5722.9800000000005
they just made a mistake well that's a

5721.06 --> 5725.620000000001
really [ __ ] stupid mistake then

5722.98 --> 5728.199

5725.62 --> 5730.12
up oh but it's wrong it's a wallaby yeah

5728.199 --> 5732.839999999999
how is that a mistake

5730.12 --> 5732.84
then

5734.199 --> 5739.659
how is somebody going to make a mistake

5736.3 --> 5742.9800000000005
by just suddenly saying no it's not that

5739.659 --> 5745.659
type how is that a mistake

5742.98 --> 5748.419999999999
insisting that something is wrong

5745.659 --> 5751.5
and then giving it another name how is

5748.42 --> 5751.5
that a mistake

5762.219 --> 5766.42
God damn it I feel so [ __ ] pissed off

5764.98 --> 5769.78
because of this

5766.42 --> 5772.719
I just I hate it when that happens I'm

5769.78 --> 5775.54
relying on my memory making it fuss over

5772.719 --> 5780.2390000000005
it and then it's just [ __ ] wrong like

5775.54 --> 5780.239
God [ __ ] damn it

5786.699 --> 5792.699
like why the [ __ ] would I even remember

5792.699 --> 5798.0599999999995
hell did somebody say that then if it's

5795.28 --> 5798.0599999999995
just wrong

5804.58 --> 5809.4
God

5806.739 --> 5809.4
just

5810.0 --> 5816.6
[ __ ] lies man everything [ __ ] lies

just live as a kid and then you'll find

5820.42 --> 5828.1
out decades later that you were just

5823.9 --> 5829.659
lied to it's just a [ __ ] made-up lie

5828.1 --> 5832.719
out of nothing

5829.659 --> 5835.54
makes no [ __ ] sense why the [ __ ] did

5832.719 --> 5837.58
somebody tell me that Skippy's a goddamn

5835.54 --> 5841.0

ever going to happen I am going to make

5908.86 --> 5915.159
[ __ ] sure that nobody lies to them if

5912.76 --> 5918.820000000001
I found out somebody just lied to my kid

5915.159 --> 5921.58
I'm gonna smack them in a [ __ ] face

5970.5 --> 5976.5
somebody told me back then it's all a b

5973.659 --> 5976.5
and it isn't

5985.36 --> 5991.86

6006.3 --> 6012.360000000001

6009.6 --> 6015.06

6015.06 --> 6020.400000000001
they die you're a pathological liar you

pathological lie and they found out that

6035.28 --> 6040.199
they were a pathological liar even as I

6037.32 --> 6043.32
was a teenager right

6040.199 --> 6046.259999999999

steamy traveler which I still wear and

6474.42 --> 6478.5
I'm really happy with that although I'd

6476.76 --> 6480.900000000001
love another one

6478.5 --> 6482.4
love another t-shirt Stevie traveler if

6480.9 --> 6484.92
she could get me another one of those

6482.4 --> 6487.92
t-shirts that would be freaking awesome

6484.92 --> 6492.26
because I do actually want another one

6487.92 --> 6492.26
also if you got it

6496.86 --> 6500.82
irritated with the whole situation yeah

6498.84 --> 6502.679
but that's the situation now it's like

6500.82 --> 6506.58
oh yeah they're lying everywhere yeah

6502.679 --> 6508.139
duh yeah they're lying a lot but this is

6506.58 --> 6511.32
from my youth

6508.139 --> 6514.139
yeah there's nothing more terrible than

6511.32 --> 6516.42
finding out that you were lied to about

6514.139 --> 6518.9400000000005
a lot of things in your youth as well

6516.42 --> 6524.179
and you didn't even realize it

6518.94 --> 6524.178999999999
it hurts it literally hurts

6529.08 --> 6535.5599999999995
also because like why why the [ __ ] did

6532.8 --> 6537.54
somebody tell me that then

6535.56 --> 6540.3
what's the [ __ ] point I mean with the

6537.54 --> 6542.159
glow I get it yeah it's a giant setup

6540.3 --> 6545.219
it's a fictional world and there's a

6542.159 --> 6547.739
giant amount of money info why the [ __ ]

6545.219 --> 6551.1
did somebody tell me Skippy was a

6547.739 --> 6555.839999999999
wallaby why the [ __ ] is that in my

6551.1 --> 6555.84
memory even I don't get it why

6561.78 --> 6566.699
anyway I am continuing rounding out the

6565.38 --> 6568.139
show

6566.699 --> 6570.839999999999
right

6568.139 --> 6572.76
I'll start over again thanks everyone

6570.84 --> 6575.28
for coming I hope you liked this show

6572.76 --> 6577.7390000000005
was a bit rowdy at the end here

6575.28 --> 6579.599999999999
I mean there's nothing more I despise

6577.739 --> 6581.099999999999
than finding out that I've been lied to

6579.6 --> 6583.820000000001
about something that's completely

6581.1 --> 6583.820000000001
pointless

6584.159 --> 6591.9
and believing it I hate that I believed

6587.88 --> 6594.4800000000005
lies that was so trusting so easy I hate

6591.9 --> 6598.82
it I really hate it because

6594.48 --> 6601.678999999999
it was unnecessarily High trust I was

6598.82 --> 6605.4
unnecessarily High trusting

6601.679 --> 6608.76
I worshiped everybody pretty much I was

6605.4 --> 6610.799999999999
like people can't lie

6608.76 --> 6613.4400000000005
I was like that

6610.8 --> 6616.320000000001
it's like yeah well they could lie but

6613.44 --> 6618.919999999999
they want because lying is bad and

6616.32 --> 6618.92
pointless

6622.639 --> 6628.38
and so I just trusted people people

6625.739 --> 6630.419999999999
saying stupid [ __ ] and then I'd be like

6628.38 --> 6632.400000000001
wow somebody said something to me I'm

6630.42 --> 6634.679
now gonna remember and cherish that

6632.4 --> 6637.739
memory of somebody saying something to

6634.679 --> 6640.4400000000005
me for the rest of my [ __ ] lie life

6637.739 --> 6643.5
and then find out 30 years later there

6640.44 --> 6645.36
was complete [ __ ] it only took me 30

6643.5 --> 6649.26
years

6645.36 --> 6649.259999999999
