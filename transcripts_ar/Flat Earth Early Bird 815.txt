membership system join button

74.96 --> 82.72
they'll be much appreciated

78.159 --> 86.08000000000001
so today the weather is quite beautiful

82.72 --> 88.88
there's trails happening though

86.08 --> 90.64
this one i literally saw as it was being

88.88 --> 93.439
sprayed so

90.64 --> 93.43900000000001
whatever it is

93.759 --> 101.759
there's some fluffy clouds

97.04 --> 105.04
and just a lot of sun

101.759 --> 108.0
so it's a really nice beautiful warm day

105.04 --> 108.0
it's very warm

110.72 --> 129.84
and yeah the wind is kind of warm

114.0 --> 129.84
it's just a really warm spring day

131.44 --> 134.72
even though it's not spring yet

138.319 --> 143.92
hello tom parker first in chat tiny

141.52 --> 143.92000000000002
womble

145.84 --> 150.31900000000002
right yeah tom parker i'm not

148.319 --> 152.319
necessarily calling them chemtrails

150.319 --> 154.79999999999998
because i don't know what it is

152.319 --> 155.76
that is being sprayed other than that

154.8 --> 159.20000000000002
it's

155.76 --> 162.0
unlikely to be just moist

159.2 --> 163.76
because that would typically evaporate

162.0 --> 165.76
pretty quickly

163.76 --> 168.64
and this doesn't but i don't know if

165.76 --> 173.12
it's chems

168.64 --> 175.67999999999998
i don't know what they're doing exactly

173.12 --> 175.68
anyway

180.159 --> 189.12
how are you all doing

185.2 --> 192.23899999999998
i'm doing okay uh

189.12 --> 194.08
still a little nervous got up early i'm

192.239 --> 195.44
doing the getting up early now as a

194.08 --> 198.8
standard thing i think

195.44 --> 200.0
for the time being and i managed to get

198.8 --> 202.959
an appointment

200.0 --> 204.319
this afternoon which is going to be

202.959 --> 206.56
after my show

204.319 --> 210.39999999999998
so yeah i'm probably not going to be

206.56 --> 210.4
there for most of the flat earth debates

210.959 --> 214.4
because it's yeah the appointment is

212.959 --> 218.0
kind of halfway the

214.4 --> 219.68
live show so i'll just probably be

218.0 --> 221.12
in there in the intro for a little and

219.68 --> 224.0
then

221.12 --> 227.04
go and then hopefully something good

224.0 --> 228.959
will come out of that

227.04 --> 230.959
and not just more of the same like oh

228.959 --> 232.799
maybe try this maybe try that and oh

230.959 --> 233.599
it's all closed due to corona that's

232.799 --> 238.239
kind of like

233.599 --> 240.79899999999998
moment yeah at this moment uh

238.239 --> 242.72
kind of a fear that's in the back of my

240.799 --> 244.4
mind a little

242.72 --> 246.879
other than that it's still pretty much

244.4 --> 246.87900000000002
the same

248.94 --> 255.84
[Music]

250.159 --> 255.84
yeah did make notes yesterday

258.56 --> 262.96
chris gross pattern oh well the trail

261.6 --> 266.47900000000004
that i showed

262.96 --> 269.52
the one right over me right over there

266.479 --> 270.71999999999997
it's weird because it's even bent like i

269.52 --> 274.15999999999997
checked out the plane

270.72 --> 277.199
flew over all like right across

274.16 --> 278.47900000000004
the sky in that direction and it seemed

277.199 --> 281.28000000000003
like it went like this

278.479 --> 283.03999999999996
and then suddenly it made it turn that

281.28 --> 285.75899999999996
was weird

283.04 --> 287.04
like in the trail it made it turn very

285.759 --> 289.84000000000003
obviously

287.04 --> 292.72
and not do too close to the horizon or

289.84 --> 292.71999999999997
anything it was still

293.199 --> 301.68
yeah very much above at least

297.52 --> 305.52
over 30 degrees from the horizon

301.68 --> 309.28000000000003
anyway uh yeah yesterday

305.52 --> 313.039
watched some owen benjamin

309.28 --> 316.08
still doing streams and it's still

313.039 --> 320.4
thankfully being uploaded on

316.08 --> 320.4
bit shoot so i'm still checking that out

320.479 --> 327.59999999999997
but yeah i do get this it's just

324.4 --> 328.63899999999995
less owen benjamin and it's i really

327.6 --> 331.759
kind of miss

328.639 --> 334.08
being there live but on the other hand

331.759 --> 334.08000000000004
you know

336.32 --> 339.84
it's not the end of the world

344.72 --> 353.84000000000003
that's stupid dr gonzo don't be annoying

356.08 --> 360.8
right so that uh then robin stanley

360.0 --> 364.08
called me up

360.8 --> 367.919
haven't heard from her in a while

364.08 --> 372.8
but apparently she's gotten into

367.919 --> 372.79999999999995
a situation herself

378.0 --> 382.56
don't want to throw out all the details

379.68 --> 386.8
i don't know if she wanted that

382.56 --> 390.88
but yeah she got into good trouble

386.8 --> 395.199
with that job that was specifically

390.88 --> 398.3
laid out for her and yeah quite a

395.199 --> 401.42
shocking situation and

398.3 --> 401.42
[Music]

403.6 --> 409.36
so she's under tension of her own

407.36 --> 411.52000000000004
but getting through it working through

409.36 --> 411.52000000000004
it

417.599 --> 422.08
how do you know it's not fake well

420.84 --> 424.96
because

422.08 --> 426.15999999999997
as in not a hologram and holograms

424.96 --> 427.919
aren't fake they're just not

426.16 --> 430.16
physical how do you know it's not fake

427.919 --> 433.919
well because there's

430.16 --> 437.59900000000005
provable proximity effects

433.919 --> 439.599
the perspective applies trail can be

437.599 --> 440.96
towards the horizon seems smaller and

439.599 --> 443.599
all that that's how you know it's not a

440.96 --> 443.599
hologram

445.36 --> 452.16
right so yeah don't uh

448.479 --> 456.56
don't be annoying please

452.16 --> 459.84000000000003
ah anyway so i had a skype call with

456.56 --> 460.319
robin stanley watch some more south park

459.84 --> 465.84
and

460.319 --> 465.84000000000003
ended up watching live the veil

465.919 --> 470.639
it's been all kinds of swings going on

467.84 --> 470.63899999999995
with crypto

471.68 --> 481.199
or with bitcoin so i heard it's a lot of

475.84 --> 481.19899999999996
like things going on with that

483.199 --> 486.639
don't have full oversight

490.16 --> 494.24
right as for my own situations it's

493.039 --> 498.479
basically

494.24 --> 498.479
well half a week now

498.96 --> 504.63899999999995
so i think that by next monday i should

502.24 --> 508.72
know more about

504.639 --> 510.8
whether the uh crypto situation from gti

508.72 --> 513.44
is going to be the way that was

510.8 --> 513.44
predicted

514.32 --> 523.0390000000001
so i was a little nervous for that

520.719 --> 523.0390000000001
uh

529.44 --> 535.839
right at the same time by the way it's

531.36 --> 535.839
like spring feelings are hitting me

536.48 --> 551.279
typically happens whenever winter's over

549.2 --> 553.519
hello gaining wisdom good to see you in

551.279 --> 553.519
chat

553.92 --> 556.8
george sanford

561.2 --> 563.839
canola

564.8 --> 569.3599999999999
is that another crypto ah there's so

568.0 --> 572.24
many out there i'm

569.36 --> 572.8000000000001
i'm barely keeping track i'm really not

572.24 --> 577.839
that

572.8 --> 577.8389999999999
great at it

581.92 --> 585.92
hello georgie mythic

586.56 --> 591.8389999999999
good to see you

616.0 --> 621.04
all right crazy stuff yeah

619.12 --> 624.24
there's another thing with the dutch

621.04 --> 627.36
politics that i just took note of

624.24 --> 627.36
it's really nutty

631.6 --> 634.8000000000001
like well first off it was kind of

633.76 --> 638.079
remarkable that

634.8 --> 641.1999999999999
the united nations man

638.079 --> 643.68
guterres says that

641.2 --> 645.839
corona measures are being used to limit

643.68 --> 648.2399999999999
human

645.839 --> 648.8800000000001
quite interesting to hear somebody at

648.24 --> 652.88
the un

648.88 --> 653.92
actually say that i'm sure it's going to

652.88 --> 660.959
be ignored

653.92 --> 665.04
as long as possible that happened

660.959 --> 665.8389999999999
right also this hearing now from this

665.04 --> 669.4399999999999
guy

665.839 --> 670.48
tarik zee who kind of like busted into

669.44 --> 673.839
the news

670.48 --> 675.76
some while back got arrested for it too

673.839 --> 679.2
he like busted in with a fake gun and

675.76 --> 681.36
that got into the news of course

679.2 --> 681.36
so

682.959 --> 687.1199999999999
seeing some of that in my typical

686.0 --> 692.16
sources and

687.12 --> 695.36
then yeah apparently the cabinet

692.16 --> 698.64
just managed to spend another 100

695.36 --> 701.92
billion euros

698.64 --> 703.1999999999999
from dutch taxes and just moving it on

701.92 --> 706.64
into europe

703.2 --> 709.6
basically donating it so they

706.64 --> 710.48
so they just quickly did that very

709.6 --> 712.9590000000001
annoying

710.48 --> 712.9590000000001
typical

714.839 --> 717.839
ridiculous

718.399 --> 723.44
right so those things kind of stood out

722.72 --> 731.839
to me

723.44 --> 731.839
other than that

738.24 --> 744.88
well good good for you i guess hope you

741.76 --> 746.959
uh you got on that bandwagon before this

744.88 --> 759.8389999999999
happened that would be nice

746.959 --> 763.5999999999999
for you at least george sanford

759.839 --> 773.839
oh what right it's a crop

763.6 --> 773.839
canadian rapeseed huh

777.36 --> 782.799
all right well sure

779.64 --> 782.799
[Music]

785.2 --> 788.5600000000001
what are we talking about today dr gonzo

787.2 --> 791.76
i don't know i'm

788.56 --> 791.76
i'm up for whatever

791.839 --> 795.9200000000001
could do back and forth with ballers

793.6 --> 795.9200000000001
again

796.079 --> 802.6389999999999
with you i'll try not to

800.079 --> 805.8389999999999
remind the ballers that they are

802.639 --> 805.839
clinically demented

806.399 --> 813.12
tried not to push that too hard on you

809.44 --> 815.2790000000001
i know it it probably hit pretty hard

813.12 --> 816.9590000000001
it is true though but that's okay you

815.279 --> 818.32
know there's a lot of people deal with a

816.959 --> 820.4799999999999
lot of mental issues

818.32 --> 822.0
fall kinds and some are considered

820.48 --> 824.9590000000001
normal and ignored

822.0 --> 826.0
and others are all oh no you can't do

824.959 --> 829.8389999999999
that

826.0 --> 829.839
right it's it's messy

842.48 --> 848.16
it yeah it's just that

846.16 --> 850.24
when i'm saying that two ballers i'm

848.16 --> 851.279
also kind of talking to myself in the

850.24 --> 854.32
past

851.279 --> 856.079
because when i was really fanatically

854.32 --> 859.279
defending the ball

856.079 --> 860.16
say 20 years ago i was also kind of

859.279 --> 863.519
demented

860.16 --> 866.079
in those moments and that does

863.519 --> 867.839
wear on you physically and i explained

866.079 --> 872.88
that even when i talked about

867.839 --> 876.8800000000001
this yesterday was the day before either

872.88 --> 877.519
by the shows if i ever considered going

876.88 --> 881.6
vegan

877.519 --> 885.839
no there's no way i have been vegetarian

881.6 --> 885.839
for a while

886.399 --> 895.519
and i guess in ways you could consider

891.36 --> 899.04
that i eat kosher sort of i try to

895.519 --> 902.399
try not to make it like keep the

899.04 --> 905.04
milk type products apart

902.399 --> 905.04
from the meat

906.24 --> 913.44
and yeah playing a bit of a a pick

910.0 --> 914.56
picking game with what type of food

913.44 --> 917.2790000000001
source i eat

914.56 --> 918.0
with a meal that sort of thing but uh

917.279 --> 927.8389999999999
yeah

918.0 --> 927.839
vegan's never gonna work not for me

928.16 --> 932.639
right so yeah i've had periods where

930.72 --> 934.88
just

932.639 --> 936.399
i think that yeah it could repeat i've

934.88 --> 938.399
had a year

936.399 --> 939.68
more than a year where i ate purely

938.399 --> 942.8
vegetarian worked out

939.68 --> 943.5999999999999
really well for me and then eventually

942.8 --> 946.8
it started

943.6 --> 950.16
kind of like yeah it

946.8 --> 952.88
did the the cohesion

950.16 --> 954.639
was lost and the necessities it's just

952.88 --> 956.079
that the body my body was just start

954.639 --> 958.32
calling like okay that's been really

956.079 --> 961.519
good but now you need this

958.32 --> 963.1990000000001
now you need this meat

961.519 --> 964.72
when before i didn't even have the

963.199 --> 966.639
impulse i explained all that

964.72 --> 968.48
when it was happening i explained all

966.639 --> 969.279
that during the show because that was in

968.48 --> 972.48
the middle of my

969.279 --> 975.519
my early bird show when i did the

972.48 --> 975.519
vegetarian thing

981.6 --> 983.839
all right

992.88 --> 997.8389999999999
bacon seed what

999.44 --> 1002.9590000000001
no i don't i don't eat bacon

1007.759 --> 1012.0790000000001
it's kind of weird how that how that has

1010.0 --> 1015.759
worked out i've avoided

1012.079 --> 1018.7199999999999
like pig meat for a very long time

1015.759 --> 1018.72
since my teens

1020.0 --> 1027.6
the kind funnily enough i kind of took

1023.199 --> 1030.6399999999999
recommendation from the jews

1027.6 --> 1032.7199999999998
and also realized oh wait yeah the

1030.64 --> 1035.919
muslims also do that why do they do that

1032.72 --> 1035.919
might that have a reason

1036.839 --> 1042.3999999999999
and

1039.679 --> 1043.199
i i kind of just stopped eating it i

1042.4 --> 1046.3190000000002
still eat

1043.199 --> 1046.319
chicken cow

1046.559 --> 1053.84
more chicken though on average

1054.88 --> 1059.679
but to me also it's weird because like

1057.28 --> 1062.48
pigs are really smart

1059.679 --> 1064.72
that's something i also discovered on

1062.48 --> 1064.72
top

1064.799 --> 1068.48
like they're they're very sentient

1066.64 --> 1072.3200000000002
creatures

1068.48 --> 1076.24
so i i i would rather see a pig

1072.32 --> 1080.0
like a pet than

1076.24 --> 1083.44
a creature to eat

1080.0 --> 1086.64
and you can train them pretty well

1083.44 --> 1086.64
if you choose to do that

1086.72 --> 1092.4
yeah you know what you're doing you know

1089.36 --> 1092.3999999999999
about animal training

1092.84 --> 1095.84
but

1096.72 --> 1103.039
yeah i'm not gonna bother other people

1100.32 --> 1109.84
telling them not to do it

1103.039 --> 1109.84
it's just that i don't want to do it

1115.6 --> 1123.84
okay dr gunzo whatever you like

1134.84 --> 1137.84
hmm

1139.98 --> 1143.13
[Music]

1149.36 --> 1154.1599999999999
i actually haven't had dinner yesterday

1151.84 --> 1154.1599999999999
at all

1156.559 --> 1161.2
i only had lunch but that's really also

1159.28 --> 1165.84
the nerves though

1161.2 --> 1165.8400000000001
it has quite a lot of impact

1174.32 --> 1178.24
but hopefully this situation will reveal

1177.52 --> 1182.08
to be

1178.24 --> 1184.08
not as stressful as it could potentially

1182.08 --> 1185.4399999999998
turn out to be even though i had

1184.08 --> 1188.3999999999999
suspicions it wouldn't

1185.44 --> 1189.039
really like as i said nothing has really

1188.4 --> 1192.72
changed

1189.039 --> 1194.799
within the setup of that but i'm still

1192.72 --> 1198.08
very nervous about it and until get some

1194.799 --> 1201.679
reassurances by a lawyer

1198.08 --> 1203.36
that indeed what i thought would be to

1201.679 --> 1204.72
it would turn out that it would be the

1203.36 --> 1206.4799999999998
case

1204.72 --> 1208.32
and then i'll probably get my hunger

1206.48 --> 1210.48
back as well

1208.32 --> 1212.08
so maybe that'll be this afternoon maybe

1210.48 --> 1214.0
that'll be later this week

1212.08 --> 1216.08
because i don't know if all that could

1214.0 --> 1220.71
be arranged just in this one appointment

1216.08 --> 1223.789
probably not

1220.71 --> 1223.789
[Music]

1228.08 --> 1238.48
the pork is good for the nerves really

1232.84 --> 1238.48
no i i don't see it

1241.28 --> 1246.6399999999999
i prefer fish oil it's much better for

1246.84 --> 1249.84
nerves

1253.2 --> 1258.559
also yeah of course things like

1256.32 --> 1259.84
getting active working out and all that

1258.559 --> 1264.799
that is also good

1259.84 --> 1264.799
for when you're nervous to get it out

1268.799 --> 1273.12
and i have been taking a few walks

1275.2 --> 1277.8400000000001
recently

1292.72 --> 1308.559
purslane it's presley

1305.28 --> 1308.559
right but

1311.12 --> 1319.84
i'll survive through it at least there's

1312.799 --> 1319.84
really good weather

1338.08 --> 1347.84
succulent what what is that

1358.84 --> 1361.84
oh

1362.96 --> 1366.64
sort of a cacti like thing

1369.84 --> 1388.9599999999998
i didn't know that was called succulent

1374.32 --> 1394.0
in english

1388.96 --> 1397.919
so kind of like a aloe vera

1394.0 --> 1397.919
that should also be a succulent type

1400.84 --> 1403.84
plan

1408.48 --> 1414.88
is my uk still around uh tom

1411.6 --> 1417.36
yeah tom parker i don't know

1414.88 --> 1418.5590000000002
i think emma uk is like really stuck to

1417.36 --> 1421.1999999999998
the

1418.559 --> 1424.1589999999999
to her discord server and still doing

1421.2 --> 1424.159
streams over there

1425.6 --> 1431.84
i haven't checked it out in a while so i

1428.08 --> 1431.84
don't know

1449.76 --> 1453.039
haven't heard of that but there's all

1452.32 --> 1459.84
kinds of

1453.039 --> 1459.84
stuff out there for nerves and all that

1462.159 --> 1468.48
i'm sure there is but for me

1465.84 --> 1469.4399999999998
like i'm not gonna really take that

1468.48 --> 1472.48
because i think

1469.44 --> 1474.799
it's good to have a little like push of

1472.48 --> 1475.6
urgency which is what the nerves really

1474.799 --> 1478.0
are

1475.6 --> 1478.7199999999998
so that i just stay on top of the

1478.0 --> 1482.159
situation

1478.72 --> 1484.159
if i if i was even able to kind of like

1482.159 --> 1487.2
get the nerves away through some kind of

1484.159 --> 1490.4
powder or a plant extract

1487.2 --> 1492.24
then i might just let it sling or

1490.4 --> 1494.24
sling around or something that's not

1492.24 --> 1496.24
good this thing just needs to be

1494.24 --> 1498.48
resolved as quickly as possible so the

1496.24 --> 1501.84
nerves are actually kind of useful

1498.48 --> 1514.0
to just force me to do it as i should as

1501.84 --> 1517.84
quickly as possible

1514.0 --> 1520.32
tablets before bed well yeah for me

1517.84 --> 1521.279
sleeping once i go to bed is never

1520.32 --> 1524.6399999999999
really a problem

1521.279 --> 1526.96
it's getting to the part where i can get

1524.64 --> 1529.1200000000001
myself to actually stop doing things and

1526.96 --> 1531.679
going to sleep

1529.12 --> 1533.1999999999998
that's more of a problem and when i'm

1531.679 --> 1535.919
nervous

1533.2 --> 1538.96
typical i just wake up earlier and i

1535.919 --> 1538.96
wake up with nerves

1539.6 --> 1544.08
but the actual going to sleep part once

1542.48 --> 1548.159
i get to that

1544.08 --> 1552.3999999999999
point that i can just stop doing things

1548.159 --> 1555.0390000000002
stop hanging on to just doing things

1552.4 --> 1555.6000000000001
instead of sleeping then yeah once i get

1555.039 --> 1559.36
into bed

1555.6 --> 1562.559
i do get get to sleep very quickly

1559.36 --> 1565.12
i never really lay weight at night

1562.559 --> 1570.72
even when i'm nervous it's just i got

1565.12 --> 1573.12
this trick

1570.72 --> 1573.919
like if it's really bad then it at some

1573.12 --> 1577.36
point

1573.919 --> 1581.44
i can just like

1577.36 --> 1585.6
manage my system in a way

1581.44 --> 1588.3200000000002
that eventually like big euphoria rushes

1585.6 --> 1591.52
will be released at some point that'll

1588.32 --> 1593.84
absolutely give a moment of

1591.52 --> 1596.799
like deep tranquility and all that i

1593.84 --> 1599.4399999999998
think it's probably like endorphins

1596.799 --> 1601.44
but yeah they will absolutely bring you

1599.44 --> 1604.88
in a sleepy

1601.44 --> 1607.039
kind of composure anyway

1604.88 --> 1609.3600000000001
so i never really have trouble going to

1607.039 --> 1612.72
sleep

1609.36 --> 1616.6399999999999
it's just that when i'm more nervous and

1612.72 --> 1620.08
all that i'll typically wake up earlier

1616.64 --> 1621.679
so i have to then really if that is

1620.08 --> 1623.76
going on for a persistent time then i

1621.679 --> 1625.52
have to kind of push myself to go to bed

1623.76 --> 1641.84
earlier

1625.52 --> 1641.84
because i will just wake up earlier

1643.919 --> 1649.039
weed helps some people well with me

1646.559 --> 1651.52
george a mithik

1649.039 --> 1653.36
like cannabis never really helped for my

1651.52 --> 1657.279
nerves

1653.36 --> 1659.1999999999998
it tends to kind of do the opposite

1657.279 --> 1660.72
it actually brings me on edge a little

1659.2 --> 1664.48
more

1660.72 --> 1669.1200000000001
although yeah when i'm not nervous then

1664.48 --> 1673.6
it kind of like opens up

1669.12 --> 1678.2399999999998
certain types of doors in my mind

1673.6 --> 1682.1589999999999
that i don't know that allow me to

1678.24 --> 1685.279
dream more detailed it's hard to explain

1682.159 --> 1685.279
what it does exactly

1686.48 --> 1689.52
but yeah it's just like oh i am nervous

1688.799 --> 1691.84
i'm nervous

1689.52 --> 1693.76
then smoking joints constantly that's a

1691.84 --> 1696.0
disaster waiting to happen for me

1693.76 --> 1697.279
like that's not good i really need to do

1696.0 --> 1699.279
something else then

1697.279 --> 1700.64
and not just nervous smoke or if it's

1699.279 --> 1702.72
really bad

1700.64 --> 1704.48
i'll just not smoke cannabis so i'll

1702.72 --> 1706.799
just leave it tobacco and

1704.48 --> 1711.44
more be like a nervous cigarette smoker

1706.799 --> 1715.76
because then at least i don't get

1711.44 --> 1718.799
like the slight anxiety

1715.76 --> 1720.559
trigger effect which does happen even

1718.799 --> 1722.8799999999999
when i'm really

1720.559 --> 1724.399
i'm really all fine then that still

1722.88 --> 1725.5200000000002
happens and it just doesn't have any

1724.399 --> 1727.76
impacts more like you

1725.52 --> 1729.9189999999999
you get woken up for a few seconds or

1727.76 --> 1732.0
for a few minutes

1729.919 --> 1733.5200000000002
and then it goes away again well when

1732.0 --> 1736.08
i'm really nervous

1733.52 --> 1737.679
it makes more impact so i have to be

1736.08 --> 1739.52
kind of careful with my smoking

1737.679 --> 1742.3990000000001
currently

1739.52 --> 1744.96
but i'm well aware of this it's not the

1742.399 --> 1744.9599999999998
first time

1745.44 --> 1748.799
right but other people i know it's just

1747.279 --> 1751.12
other people

1748.799 --> 1753.36
when they smoke cannabis they just

1751.12 --> 1755.76
mellow out

1753.36 --> 1759.279
it works really well for them sometimes

1755.76 --> 1759.279
i'm a little jealous of those people

1765.2 --> 1768.3990000000001
therefore early bird

1778.84 --> 1781.84
what

1786.48 --> 1790.88
all right hey nathan oakley

1791.2 --> 1795.8400000000001
good to see you

1803.6 --> 1807.12
right oh yeah there was a qe live

1805.76 --> 1809.36
yesterday

1807.12 --> 1811.4399999999998
and i did get in the discord for a

1809.36 --> 1815.279
moment but for some reason

1811.44 --> 1817.3600000000001
i wasn't being addressed it was weird

1815.279 --> 1818.32
and then at some point i realized like

1817.36 --> 1820.9599999999998
yeah i'm not

1818.32 --> 1823.84
really all that cohesive at that time

1820.96 --> 1823.8400000000001
anyway it was

1824.0 --> 1830.08
just too distracted and a little slow

1827.52 --> 1831.679
probably from not eating enough because

1830.08 --> 1832.6399999999999
i really haven't eaten anything

1831.679 --> 1836.0
yesterday

1832.64 --> 1839.039
after lunch i hadn't just i did

1836.0 --> 1841.6
drink a couple of beers but

1839.039 --> 1844.32
i just didn't really get any hunger

1841.6 --> 1844.32
other than that

1846.399 --> 1852.559
so i just kind of stayed out of it

1850.64 --> 1855.279
stuck to chat but it was pretty good

1852.559 --> 1855.279
when i heard

1855.679 --> 1868.3200000000002
more about the scientific method

1864.32 --> 1872.96
and also the of course the ex the

1868.32 --> 1875.4399999999998
mistakes the popular mistakes of science

1872.96 --> 1877.76
like how people just easily stamp

1875.44 --> 1880.559
science on something without the actual

1877.76 --> 1880.559
requirements

1881.2 --> 1894.3990000000001
being met

1892.32 --> 1896.48
right physical work or exercise helps

1894.399 --> 1900.7199999999998
yeah yeah

1896.48 --> 1900.72
yeah i did mention that one jojo my teak

1900.799 --> 1907.84
it does help

1912.08 --> 1918.399
beer is overall good for your well-being

1915.36 --> 1920.08
well that depends

1918.399 --> 1922.4799999999998
really on the amount you're going to be

1920.08 --> 1922.48
taking

1924.48 --> 1929.039
but i yeah i don't think i'm overdoing

1926.96 --> 1929.039
it

1933.679 --> 1936.88
but i yeah it's true

1937.039 --> 1941.84
and yeah there's been kind of a short

1939.36 --> 1944.7199999999998
period where i didn't drink at all

1941.84 --> 1946.799
like right after i got better like from

1944.72 --> 1950.48
yeah from being really sick a week

1946.799 --> 1953.519
last year in november

1950.48 --> 1956.88
i think so and i didn't drink

1953.519 --> 1958.96
also because kind of it was yeah well

1956.88 --> 1962.159
drinking that got me that sick

1958.96 --> 1964.159
that kind of triggered that sickness so

1962.159 --> 1966.64
and in all that time that i didn't drink

1964.159 --> 1968.159
i just noticed very blatantly that i was

1966.64 --> 1971.039
a lot more hungry

1968.159 --> 1971.0390000000002
so hungry

1971.6 --> 1975.36
and then eventually i decided to like

1974.32 --> 1977.4399999999998
test out

1975.36 --> 1979.76
beer and it worked really well and it

1977.44 --> 1984.3990000000001
got less hungry

1979.76 --> 1991.84
so i know i know it does

1984.399 --> 1991.84
feed a little at least

1992.799 --> 2000.32
and i take like good

1996.0 --> 2005.84
organic quality not some cheap ass

2000.32 --> 2005.84
generic beer

2022.59 --> 2025.8799999999999
[Music]

2030.84 --> 2033.84
right

2051.2 --> 2055.2
why did why do you want to know about my

2054.0 --> 2058.079
beer

2055.2 --> 2058.839
what so no not i'm so i just told you

2058.079 --> 2063.44
only

2058.839 --> 2065.2
organic they don't have that

2063.44 --> 2066.96
so it's not going to be any brand you've

2065.2 --> 2071.359
ever heard of

2066.96 --> 2075.839
very simple because they don't advertise

2071.359 --> 2075.839
like mainstream brands

2082.8 --> 2090.32
thoughts on perseverance landing uh

2085.919 --> 2091.839
what landing only thing i've seen so far

2090.32 --> 2103.839
is just cgi i haven't

2091.839 --> 2103.839
actually seen anything

2108.56 --> 2117.839
well dr gonzo you're wrong

2122.96 --> 2129.92
cato right cato died well

2126.56 --> 2132.64
it i do kind of appreciate i'm not very

2129.92 --> 2132.64
strict at it

2134.56 --> 2139.04
but funnily enough i now have a habit

2137.28 --> 2142.2400000000002
where i will

2139.04 --> 2145.04
like one part

2142.24 --> 2145.7599999999998
of the day i'll eat like french fries

2145.04 --> 2148.8
that i'd

2145.76 --> 2148.8
like that i made

2149.28 --> 2156.7200000000003
or that i fry myself all organic

2153.359 --> 2157.44
and then later i'll eat like the other

2156.72 --> 2162.16
half

2157.44 --> 2165.28
which will be meat and vegetables

2162.16 --> 2167.1189999999997
you know originally they're all kind of

2165.28 --> 2168.7200000000003
where i have been used to like always

2167.119 --> 2173.839
put that all together now i kind of

2168.72 --> 2173.839
split it apart

2175.44 --> 2187.839
and that works out great

2199.92 --> 2203.359
well you rest your case like to be

2201.599 --> 2206.88
proven wrong well

2203.359 --> 2210.0
organic right i'm not talking about

2206.88 --> 2213.52
organic versus synthetic synthetic

2210.0 --> 2213.52
right i'm not talking about

2213.599 --> 2218.96
the mechanical nature of the substance

2216.96 --> 2220.7200000000003
from a physics perspective i'm talking

2218.96 --> 2224.2400000000002
about organic

2220.72 --> 2224.24
as a specific type of

2227.28 --> 2231.8390000000004
it's not a brand it's

2231.92 --> 2238.079
it's just organic doesn't

2234.96 --> 2240.16
like it pays a lot of attention as to

2238.079 --> 2241.8390000000004
the origin of the food if there's no

2240.16 --> 2245.2
pesticides being used no

2241.839 --> 2248.4
artificial fertilizers no chemical or

2245.2 --> 2248.3999999999996
genetic tempering

2250.24 --> 2255.52
that type of organic and i've eaten

2253.92 --> 2258.48
organic for

2255.52 --> 2261.04
persistently really without real

2258.48 --> 2265.359
exceptions

2261.04 --> 2271.839
oh for well that's a long time for at

2265.359 --> 2271.839
least 13 years

2272.48 --> 2275.68
i'm very glad i did

2278.079 --> 2281.76
i don't even want to imagine like what

2280.48 --> 2284.0
type of

2281.76 --> 2285.28
physical problems i would have be i

2284.0 --> 2288.56
would be experiencing

2285.28 --> 2290.6000000000004
right now if i hadn't done that i don't

2288.56 --> 2293.73
even want to try to imagine

2290.6 --> 2293.73
[Music]

2296.64 --> 2300.8799999999997
i probably now have allergies coming out

2299.92 --> 2303.92
of my ass

2300.88 --> 2303.92
if i hadn't done that

2306.24 --> 2313.2799999999997
not literally but just like i have

2309.839 --> 2317.599
allergy sensitivity my mother was like

2313.28 --> 2320.2400000000002
yeah completely got consumed by it

2317.599 --> 2322.4
yeah like the viability it's just that

2320.24 --> 2325.2
eating really healthy

2322.4 --> 2327.359
doing the way things i do it i have it

2325.2 --> 2330.3199999999997
completely under control

2327.359 --> 2330.64
so it's really weird because things that

2330.32 --> 2332.88
just

2330.64 --> 2334.96
bothered the [ __ ] out of my mother and

2332.88 --> 2338.079
drove her completely nuts

2334.96 --> 2340.7200000000003
like she had a pretty extreme

2338.079 --> 2342.8
itching attacks for example and they

2340.72 --> 2345.5989999999997
were allergic and she then would take

2342.8 --> 2347.44
things against it pharmaceuticals to

2345.599 --> 2348.88
suppress that because it literally drove

2347.44 --> 2351.359
her nuts well

2348.88 --> 2352.079
i've just minor minor minor version of

2351.359 --> 2355.359
that

2352.079 --> 2360.6400000000003
and so it's yeah it's abs it's just

2355.359 --> 2360.64
normal it's not that bad

2361.359 --> 2364.48
there's no terrible skin rashes or

2363.76 --> 2367.96
anything

2364.48 --> 2370.96
it's just yeah i'm just doing fine

2367.96 --> 2370.96
physiologically

2372.32 --> 2378.7200000000003
but every time i do stress out

2375.359 --> 2379.839
there's overall more yeah symptoms

2378.72 --> 2382.48
rolling out of that

2379.839 --> 2383.2
so it's a universal burden on my body

2382.48 --> 2385.2
and then

2383.2 --> 2387.1189999999997
problems kind of get a little bit more

2385.2 --> 2391.4399999999996
pushy in general that's

2387.119 --> 2391.44
that's how i'm used to it that's how it

2394.839 --> 2397.839
works

2401.68 --> 2411.839
the rover is up there on mars right

2424.88 --> 2432.4
hmm oh iron 26 so there was supposed

2428.56 --> 2432.4
real footage i haven't seen that

2432.8 --> 2439.8390000000004
i've only seen cgi so far so

2447.58 --> 2451.11
[Music]

2456.07 --> 2459.219
[Music]

2481.599 --> 2487.119
oh so there's clips of rover

2487.2 --> 2492.839
that's cool so no no footage of how it

2490.96 --> 2495.04
actually landed and all that then i

2492.839 --> 2498.24
guess

2495.04 --> 2498.24
adjust the cgi

2500.0 --> 2504.56
the cgi representation as a

2502.2 --> 2509.5989999999997
visualization assistant right not the

2504.56 --> 2512.56
actual footage

2509.599 --> 2514.4
and the oh so where is it then where's

2512.56 --> 2515.04
that footage i haven't seen it i've only

2514.4 --> 2523.839
seen

2515.04 --> 2523.839
cgi representation visual assistant

2524.4 --> 2528.48
you could link it okay that would be

2526.24 --> 2528.4799999999996
cool

2531.92 --> 2537.839
i'll check it out i'll see what i think

2533.92 --> 2537.839
about it

2562.839 --> 2565.839
hmm

2577.58 --> 2580.639
[Music]

2584.319 --> 2589.839
okay well just let me know and i'll

2587.359 --> 2592.0789999999997
give you a temporary wrench so you can

2589.839 --> 2607.839
put the link out in chat

2592.079 --> 2607.8390000000004
iron 26

2618.88 --> 2627.44
nice i see so yeah

2622.96 --> 2627.44
funny clouds kind of do dissolve

2629.839 --> 2635.2799999999997
remember how that looked before

2633.04 --> 2637.7599999999998
so there's still some haziness from the

2635.28 --> 2637.76
trails

2641.599 --> 2649.839
but those puffy clouds most of them are

2643.92 --> 2649.839
now gone

2674.839 --> 2677.839
hmm

2697.359 --> 2702.0789999999997
right so while iron 26 is trying to find

2700.4 --> 2705.44
that footage

2702.079 --> 2708.5600000000004
of the actual supposed landing

2705.44 --> 2708.56
is there anything else

2708.72 --> 2712.48
any of you would like me to address

2717.119 --> 2733.839
deep space network oh my god

2733.9 --> 2740.59
[Music]

2758.839 --> 2761.839
huh

2772.839 --> 2775.839
okay

2778.56 --> 2784.319
right so a big antenna here on earth

2781.839 --> 2784.319
basically

2787.359 --> 2789.839
that's it

2790.8 --> 2796.96
dsm is nasa's international array of

2794.319 --> 2800.16
giant antennas

2796.96 --> 2802.0
that support interplanetary spacecraft

2800.16 --> 2804.3999999999996
missions off and that's just

2802.0 --> 2804.4
cute

2805.04 --> 2811.599
right so they can yeah have radio

2808.16 --> 2814.7999999999997
wherever they like right so not

2811.599 --> 2815.6800000000003
necessarily a giant amount of satellites

2814.8 --> 2819.04
they just

2815.68 --> 2830.3999999999996
have a big freaking

2819.04 --> 2832.24
antenna surprise surprise

2830.4 --> 2834.56
they don't actually show picture of it

2832.24 --> 2834.56
though

2839.2 --> 2845.839
oh wait it's different sites combined

2852.16 --> 2859.839
all right one in california one in spain

2855.68 --> 2859.839
one in australia

2866.96 --> 2873.839
all right

2877.04 --> 2887.839
okay you found it

2912.88 --> 2917.76
cool thank you check it out

2922.64 --> 2925.359
three minutes

2926.839 --> 2929.839
what

2930.64 --> 2936.8799999999997
that's it it's it's a drop

2933.76 --> 2936.88
a drop above

2937.2 --> 2943.52
that's it they just

2940.4 --> 2945.76
opened up the can and just let it go

2943.52 --> 2945.7599999999998
down

2951.92 --> 2957.839
so no approach

2969.44 --> 2973.92
yeah the supposed mars top-down camera

2971.76 --> 2976.2400000000002
it doesn't actually even show any kind

2973.92 --> 2981.04
of horizon

2976.24 --> 2985.839
of mars it's just pointing downward

2981.04 --> 2985.839
i'm scrolling through it

2989.599 --> 2994.48
it's interesting though it is an

2992.4 --> 2996.559
interesting construction but

2994.48 --> 2998.079
yeah this is not exactly what i was

2996.559 --> 3001.6800000000003
hoping for

2998.079 --> 3001.6800000000003
i was hoping for an actual

3001.839 --> 3008.96
approach footage actual

3005.839 --> 3011.52
like hey mars has a planet we're drawn

3008.96 --> 3014.8
closer oh you're going into

3011.52 --> 3015.92
the atmosphere whatever and then this

3014.8 --> 3018.88
but apparently it's

3015.92 --> 3018.88
only just the

3019.52 --> 3027.839
the landing part i guess

3059.839 --> 3069.839
just looks kind of odd though like

3063.839 --> 3069.839
is it being dropped from a balloon

3151.359 --> 3153.839
what

3154.64 --> 3157.839
oh my god

3157.92 --> 3160.2400000000002
okay

3162.4 --> 3167.28
oh the actual touchdown it's cool that

3165.599 --> 3172.04
they tried it

3167.28 --> 3175.119
but yeah i'm i'm noticing something

3172.04 --> 3178.16
immediately and that is that

3175.119 --> 3182.8
is a very small small

3178.16 --> 3186.7999999999997
lander so this seems to be more like a

3182.8 --> 3189.8390000000004
thunderbirds go type of mars landing

3186.8 --> 3193.119
because yeah the turbulence patterns

3189.839 --> 3196.319
of that sand blowing around versus just

3193.119 --> 3198.8
that lander thing or either the lander

3196.319 --> 3203.119
is this big

3198.8 --> 3206.4
or or i don't know it just

3203.119 --> 3211.119
immediately stood out like this

3206.4 --> 3213.2000000000003
is not a large spherical being drop

3211.119 --> 3214.48
immediately when i saw the sand blowing

3213.2 --> 3217.68
i just thought wait

3214.48 --> 3218.64
that's very close up that's really close

3217.68 --> 3222.24
up

3218.64 --> 3237.839
to the sand so

3222.24 --> 3237.839
that's odd

3243.76 --> 3247.599
an export and air vertices well i

3246.96 --> 3249.839
haven't

3247.599 --> 3251.28
i have a good intuition for turbulence

3249.839 --> 3254.319
patterns

3251.28 --> 3258.96
i've paid a lot of attention to it

3254.319 --> 3258.96
my entire life where whenever i spot it

3259.28 --> 3264.8
and i know scales i know turbulence

3262.319 --> 3268.64
pattern skills because there is a scale

3264.8 --> 3272.88
to these things a lot

3268.64 --> 3272.8799999999997
right just like for example

3273.359 --> 3277.119
comparing it with water there is a

3275.76 --> 3279.119
surface tension

3277.119 --> 3280.4
the surface tension is on a very

3279.119 --> 3283.44
specific skill

3280.4 --> 3286.559
yielding in very specific

3283.44 --> 3289.76
type of patterns that correlate to that

3286.559 --> 3293.44
specific size scale

3289.76 --> 3296.88
so you can see by the patterns of water

3293.44 --> 3298.88
as to how big it really is because of

3296.88 --> 3301.28
the turbulence patterns

3298.88 --> 3302.079
and that's something that i just learned

3301.28 --> 3304.8390000000004
i learned that

3302.079 --> 3307.8390000000004
the size of skill through the turbulence

3304.839 --> 3307.839
patterns

3309.599 --> 3313.76
and that really stood out to me here

3311.839 --> 3315.7599999999998
like it really hit me in the face like

3313.76 --> 3321.8390000000004
whoa

3315.76 --> 3321.8390000000004
that looks like the ladder is this big

3327.26 --> 3330.409
[Music]

3363.52 --> 3368.72
yes that's right with models burning in

3366.48 --> 3371.76
movies yes you can see it

3368.72 --> 3376.0
does it make me appreciate

3371.76 --> 3379.119
the movie less often

3376.0 --> 3382.24
know practical effects are really cool

3379.119 --> 3384.079
even if you can spot that it is just a

3382.24 --> 3388.5589999999997
model

3384.079 --> 3388.559
it can be really cool in a movie

3388.799 --> 3394.88
but i can see that now not

3392.319 --> 3396.319
everybody can probably pick up on that

3394.88 --> 3398.0
sort of thing

3396.319 --> 3400.0
especially when you're really young you

3398.0 --> 3402.24
might not really see that so your

3400.0 --> 3405.839
suspense of disbelief will make it much

3402.24 --> 3405.839
more real to you

3418.799 --> 3433.839
what looks like you could scan the

3421.68 --> 3433.839
parachute like a round barcode what

3457.599 --> 3464.2400000000002
really there's a digitally encoded

3460.88 --> 3469.92
message in the parachute really

3464.24 --> 3469.9199999999996
let me look where is that where do i see

3472.839 --> 3475.839
that

3531.76 --> 3538.1600000000003
really the lander is two meters tall

3535.2 --> 3540.8799999999997
i'm not buying it i'm just not buying

3538.16 --> 3544.5589999999997
that larry the march

3540.88 --> 3547.119
that thing is like 30 centimeters tall

3544.559 --> 3547.119
at best

3547.44 --> 3559.839
or maybe maybe like half a meter

3551.52 --> 3559.839
but 2 meters no way

3566.0 --> 3569.92
oh well tiny wobble look nasa for who

3568.96 --> 3572.96
they're going to be

3569.92 --> 3573.76
trying to convince right they'll do just

3572.96 --> 3576.2400000000002
fine

3573.76 --> 3577.5200000000004
as i look to this it was very

3576.24 --> 3581.1189999999997
entertaining

3577.52 --> 3584.16
like my ballwin from

3581.119 --> 3586.319
all those ages ago is like wow this

3584.16 --> 3586.8799999999997
looks really cool it did look really

3586.319 --> 3588.5589999999997
cool

3586.88 --> 3591.6800000000003
but then it just stood out to me like

3588.559 --> 3594.3190000000004
there's something off with the scale

3591.68 --> 3594.799
but that's just fine you know most

3594.319 --> 3597.2799999999997
people

3594.799 --> 3598.079
probably won't really pick up on it or

3597.28 --> 3600.2400000000002
maybe they do

3598.079 --> 3604.319
and they just believe it because

3600.24 --> 3607.04
otherwise it looked very entertaining

3604.319 --> 3607.839
for for somebody that's interested in

3607.04 --> 3615.839
that sort of

3607.839 --> 3615.839
science fiction

3621.359 --> 3625.92
don't need to cut snow if we really went

3624.96 --> 3629.119
to mars

3625.92 --> 3630.96
no i'm pretty sure that we can know

3629.119 --> 3633.28
once you figure out the nature of

3630.96 --> 3636.64
reality and what is

3633.28 --> 3636.6400000000003
absolutely impossible

3636.72 --> 3643.68
right so i'm sure that

3640.319 --> 3646.72
things are transpiring somewhere

3643.68 --> 3649.2
they did it wasn't cgi it wasn't

3646.72 --> 3652.0789999999997
computer generated effects

3649.2 --> 3654.0
it was physical the footage so something

3652.079 --> 3658.7200000000003
happened somewhere

3654.0 --> 3662.559
but on another planet

3658.72 --> 3665.5989999999997
on another side of a sky vacuum you say

3662.559 --> 3668.4
no that's not gonna happen

3665.599 --> 3671.839
you don't have to be a god to know that

3668.4 --> 3671.839
that's not possible

3676.8 --> 3682.079
[Music]

3679.839 --> 3683.68
well tom parker there's been worse

3682.079 --> 3687.6800000000003
footages you know

3683.68 --> 3689.839
it was very entertaining right

3687.68 --> 3692.0789999999997
if you would look at it from a science

3689.839 --> 3694.48
fiction enthusiast

3692.079 --> 3696.2400000000002
would also like those types of movies it

3694.48 --> 3698.48
looked pretty cool right

3696.24 --> 3701.04
it was entertaining now whether you

3698.48 --> 3703.92
truly believe it

3701.04 --> 3703.92
is another matter

3708.4 --> 3713.44
maybe you actually went yeah no you

3712.0 --> 3716.559
can't go

3713.44 --> 3721.119
there is no other planet

3716.559 --> 3723.599
other physical body floating in a vacuum

3721.119 --> 3724.2400000000002
right the thing you're standing on isn't

3723.599 --> 3727.28
even

3724.24 --> 3729.5989999999997
a thing a ball floating in a vacuum

3727.28 --> 3732.6400000000003
so there definitely can't be any other

3729.599 --> 3734.48
body like that out there

3732.64 --> 3737.1189999999997
why can't we go because it's physically

3734.48 --> 3737.119
impossible

3739.44 --> 3746.559
there's no place to go to

3742.48 --> 3746.559
out there like that

3752.559 --> 3759.2000000000003
it is big is it oh larry the march

3756.72 --> 3761.52
could be it could it could be that they

3759.2 --> 3764.5589999999997
have a big version

3761.52 --> 3765.2
right and then they have a smaller to

3764.559 --> 3769.119
scale

3765.2 --> 3773.359
model like a smaller downscaled model

3769.119 --> 3773.359
for the for the actual

3773.599 --> 3776.7200000000003
for the actual show just let's say it

3775.52 --> 3778.799
like that right

3776.72 --> 3781.68
just in movies this happens too right

3778.799 --> 3783.68
you have you have a vehicle

3781.68 --> 3785.839
like a special type of vehicle for like

3783.68 --> 3788.8799999999997
a special

3785.839 --> 3791.599
group or whatever and then

3788.88 --> 3792.079
if they yeah still in the in a practical

3791.599 --> 3796.559
effect

3792.079 --> 3800.2400000000002
era then they have miniatures

3796.559 --> 3803.92
then they can like oh do that miniature

3800.24 --> 3807.359
like let it roll through a huge

3803.92 --> 3807.359
explosion right

3808.0 --> 3812.799
something like that this is very rough

3809.92 --> 3815.599
example so they have a miniature

3812.799 --> 3819.28
especially because they need that they

3815.599 --> 3819.28
need that for whatever they're gonna do

3820.4 --> 3826.88
so yeah sure they have a real

3824.079 --> 3829.039
life-size version of it it's not

3826.88 --> 3830.079
impossible at all that they also built a

3829.039 --> 3833.2000000000003
miniature

3830.079 --> 3833.2000000000003
for the demonstration

3835.52 --> 3838.559
it's much more likely that they've done

3837.68 --> 3840.3999999999996
that

3838.559 --> 3842.079
not necessarily saying that it is

3840.4 --> 3843.76
absolutely certain that they've done

3842.079 --> 3845.599
that but it's much more likely they've

3843.76 --> 3848.48
done that

3845.599 --> 3850.48
than that they've sent something through

3848.48 --> 3853.839
a sky vacuum to another

3850.48 --> 3853.839
physical body

3856.96 --> 3867.839
because nasa is cinematography after all

3878.319 --> 3881.68
yeah iron 26 well i've been following

3881.28 --> 3884.4
from

3881.68 --> 3884.3999999999996
way back

3884.72 --> 3890.48
like people on the internet doing videos

3888.559 --> 3894.3190000000004
video reviewers

3890.48 --> 3894.96
and yeah multiple of them had like a gag

3894.319 --> 3898.24
like i'm

3894.96 --> 3900.64
in a cgi spaceship this is my spaceship

3898.24 --> 3901.68
i'm doing my reviews or whatever in my

3900.64 --> 3904.799
spaceship

3901.68 --> 3909.2
so and that was like

3904.799 --> 3913.7599999999998
over 10 years ago

3909.2 --> 3913.7599999999998
just kind of quickly put together

3914.0 --> 3923.839
not even with highly professional cgi

3916.64 --> 3923.839
but still pretty decent

3952.72 --> 3956.5589999999997
right i've heard it i've heard that guns

3954.799 --> 3959.359
have never run rmp

3956.559 --> 3959.3590000000004
by the way welcome

3959.839 --> 3965.839
that is on devon's island apparently

3978.72 --> 3984.5589999999997
why would anyone why would anybody

3981.839 --> 3986.0789999999997
keep asking that same question over and

3984.559 --> 3988.88
over again

3986.079 --> 3990.799
when it's been answered hundreds of

3988.88 --> 3994.88
thousands of times

3990.799 --> 3994.88
over the last decade

3995.28 --> 4000.48
why lie about anything to gain control

3998.799 --> 4001.28
if you could tell a lie that will be

4000.48 --> 4004.88
believed

4001.28 --> 4007.92
then you have control over what

4004.88 --> 4010.4
will guide those people through their

4007.92 --> 4010.4
beliefs

4011.28 --> 4016.96
and hey guess what's a lot of money lots

4014.64 --> 4020.96
and lots and lots of money

4016.96 --> 4022.64
to do that

4020.96 --> 4024.079
so why would you lie about the shape of

4022.64 --> 4035.839
the earth

4024.079 --> 4035.8390000000004
well biggest budget in human history

4036.96 --> 4045.359
just yeah dreams are big business

4041.76 --> 4047.28
so if people can be made to latch onto a

4045.359 --> 4050.16
controlled lie

4047.28 --> 4052.4
then yeah that latching onto the

4050.16 --> 4054.96
controlled lie can be financially

4052.4 --> 4056.4
exploited to no end and the more

4054.96 --> 4059.599
stubborn the people hold

4056.4 --> 4062.96
on to those lies given to them the more

4059.599 --> 4076.1800000000003
they can be financially exploited that's

4062.96 --> 4081.32
how it works

4076.18 --> 4081.3199999999997
[Music]

4088.839 --> 4091.839
hmm

4116.839 --> 4119.839
so

4120.96 --> 4128.2390000000005
oh really jose bombington so tell me how

4124.64 --> 4130.64
how do we financially exploit

4128.239 --> 4132.08
the inside that the earth is flat how do

4130.64 --> 4136.08
we financially exploit

4132.08 --> 4137.359
that the only even remote possibility to

4136.08 --> 4141.679
sort of exploit it

4137.359 --> 4143.759
is by basically yeah

4141.679 --> 4146.719
just revealing the big lie and going

4143.759 --> 4151.52
against it there's going to be a lot of

4146.719 --> 4154.799
rebellious impulses and that can be used

4151.52 --> 4157.92
to make an us group

4154.799 --> 4161.5199999999995
us against the world and the globe

4157.92 --> 4164.4
that the majority think is real

4161.52 --> 4164.719
but yeah how far can you pull that not a

4164.4 --> 4167.199
lot

4164.719 --> 4168.159
there's not a lot of conjured dreams

4167.199 --> 4170.239
that people are

4168.159 --> 4171.759
willing to relinquish a huge amount of

4170.239 --> 4175.12
cash for

4171.759 --> 4177.759
in order to reinforce

4175.12 --> 4177.759
that belief

4178.159 --> 4180.4
right

4186.4 --> 4190.639999999999
although maybe i don't know man maybe by

4188.64 --> 4194.159000000001
this time there are people that

4190.64 --> 4195.679
will just love to see like the disc

4194.159 --> 4199.92
model being promoted

4195.679 --> 4201.679
and very cool cgi for the disc model

4199.92 --> 4203.4400000000005
and they would be like yeah well at

4201.679 --> 4206.64
least it's not nasa

4203.44 --> 4210.799999999999
nonsense and they might then

4206.64 --> 4210.8
hang on to that for a very long time

4211.44 --> 4217.919999999999
despite the issues

4214.48 --> 4220.08
so that but other than that i i don't

4217.92 --> 4224.08
really see it

4220.08 --> 4226.0
because yeah such fantastical exploit

4224.08 --> 4228.719
financial exploitation of people's

4226.0 --> 4232.719
beliefs only really works

4228.719 --> 4235.84
when there is blatant falsehoods

4232.719 --> 4239.76
that are very tintillating

4235.84 --> 4239.76
very fantastical very appealing

4240.719 --> 4244.2390000000005
that give the fantasy a lot of room

4242.64 --> 4247.280000000001
that's the type of

4244.239 --> 4251.04
lies that are easy to exploit

4247.28 --> 4253.759999999999
with the flat earth there's still some

4251.04 --> 4255.12
potential things like oh is there

4253.76 --> 4257.12
another in the more

4255.12 --> 4258.88
more realm right next to us it's like

4257.12 --> 4261.12
the idea of oh

4258.88 --> 4263.76
aliens except not aliens from outer

4261.12 --> 4266.4
space but just right next door

4263.76 --> 4266.400000000001
there's that

4269.76 --> 4273.84
and other than that i don't see it

4288.8 --> 4296.719
yes yes doctor gone so they did you know

4292.88 --> 4299.76
those like people have conspired

4296.719 --> 4302.4800000000005
with like fiction

4299.76 --> 4304.56
or religious stories and then made

4302.48 --> 4305.28
miniature cults out of it that's been

4304.56 --> 4308.400000000001
happening

4305.28 --> 4313.04
forever for a

4308.4 --> 4315.92
very long time so yeah

4313.04 --> 4317.199
elitists and even nobility all kinds of

4315.92 --> 4320.0
people scam artists

4317.199 --> 4322.5599999999995
have always done that always try to

4320.0 --> 4326.84
figure out what are silly things

4322.56 --> 4328.400000000001
people will believe and how can we abuse

4326.84 --> 4330.32
that like

4328.4 --> 4333.199
their willingness to double down on the

4330.32 --> 4342.08
lie how can we financially exploit that

4333.199 --> 4357.04
they've been at that forever

4342.08 --> 4360.08
it's called grapplers

4357.04 --> 4361.44
it's really not that strange to think

4360.08 --> 4363.5199999999995
about it

4361.44 --> 4370.96
aliens right next door what do you mean

4363.52 --> 4374.080000000001
or why exactly what i said

4370.96 --> 4376.96
in the heliocentric idea there is a

4374.08 --> 4377.36
notion going on the philosophy whatever

4376.96 --> 4379.84
about

4377.36 --> 4382.639999999999
alien possibility of other lives

4379.84 --> 4385.6
bringing forth evolution wise just like

4382.64 --> 4387.52
humanity and they might be ahead

4385.6 --> 4389.52
of the curve in time in their

4387.52 --> 4392.88
evolutionary scale blah blah blah all

4389.52 --> 4395.92
the star trek idea aliens right

4392.88 --> 4399.76
other life from another planet

4395.92 --> 4403.1990000000005
right that's in heliocentrism a thing

4399.76 --> 4405.719
it's widely accepted as standard

4403.199 --> 4407.28
standard standardized idea in the

4405.719 --> 4410.64
heliocentrism now

4407.28 --> 4412.5599999999995
standardized right

4410.64 --> 4414.96
on a flat earth there is still a

4412.56 --> 4418.400000000001
possibility that there are other lands

4414.96 --> 4419.52
that might be out of reach or might even

4418.4 --> 4422.0
be temporarily

4419.52 --> 4423.360000000001
closed off because of an ice barrier or

4422.0 --> 4427.12
a

4423.36 --> 4431.599999999999
closing loop who knows

4427.12 --> 4434.96
so those idea the idea of aliens

4431.6 --> 4438.320000000001
might not be completely excluded

4434.96 --> 4441.84
in the real world in the flat earth

4438.32 --> 4444.48
because it might be out there and then

4441.84 --> 4447.12
very close to us as in directly

4444.48 --> 4455.839999999999
physically connected

4447.12 --> 4455.84
not with a giant space vacuum in between

4457.84 --> 4461.92
who makes money out of pretending the

4459.28 --> 4461.92
earth is round

4462.96 --> 4466.56
people in media

4464.62 --> 4470.239
[Music]

4466.56 --> 4473.1990000000005
people in the radio business radio

4470.239 --> 4473.199
communication

4473.28 --> 4480.639999999999
people in

4477.12 --> 4483.84
well astronomy all of that

4480.64 --> 4487.280000000001
there's a whole range of jobs

4483.84 --> 4487.92
specifically based on the earth being a

4487.28 --> 4490.32
globe

4487.92 --> 4492.719
and reinforcing that somehow for some

4490.32 --> 4492.719
reason

4495.44 --> 4500.0
why is the sun fake what do you mean

4498.64 --> 4502.4800000000005
with fake

4500.0 --> 4504.239
it's just a parrot it's it's an apparent

4502.48 --> 4507.28
thing you see

4504.239 --> 4508.959999999999
and there is light reaching us being

4507.28 --> 4511.679
absorbed

4508.96 --> 4512.32
that's what we know about it now you

4511.679 --> 4514.4800000000005
can't

4512.32 --> 4517.5199999999995
actually prove that this visual

4514.48 --> 4520.718999999999
phenomena is even the cause

4517.52 --> 4521.52
of the daylight reaching us from any

4520.719 --> 4524.32
physical

4521.52 --> 4526.2390000000005
literal proximity from yeah from any

4524.32 --> 4528.719
euclidean point in space

4526.239 --> 4530.718999999999
that's just this apparent disk i

4528.719 --> 4533.84
concluded that the apparent disk

4530.719 --> 4537.76
is rather a side effect

4533.84 --> 4541.12
of looking in the direction from where

4537.76 --> 4553.4400000000005
the daylight appears to manifest

4541.12 --> 4567.84
and then reaches us

4553.44 --> 4567.839999999999
right so the sun is a real phenomenon

4578.84 --> 4581.84
right

4583.28 --> 4587.04
still be loads to discover well the

4586.159 --> 4590.4
thing is

4587.04 --> 4594.0
there is so much already discovered

4590.4 --> 4595.28
that the availability of knowledge and

4594.0 --> 4599.52
the potential for

4595.28 --> 4602.5599999999995
spiritual and mental ascension

4599.52 --> 4605.280000000001
is almost already maxed out

4602.56 --> 4607.52
it's just there is another side issue

4605.28 --> 4612.08
and that is

4607.52 --> 4615.280000000001
human culture personal

4612.08 --> 4617.28
reflection critical thinking and so yeah

4615.28 --> 4620.4
with all the availability of

4617.28 --> 4622.5599999999995
everything does it mean that people will

4620.4 --> 4625.759999999999
automatically be susceptible

4622.56 --> 4629.04
to to actually embrace it and and

4625.76 --> 4631.92
figure it out correctly

4629.04 --> 4634.239
right because a lot of people literally

4631.92 --> 4637.36
can't handle the truth

4634.239 --> 4639.36
there's certain degrees of truth that

4637.36 --> 4640.239
some people just walk away from every

4639.36 --> 4642.639999999999
time

4640.239 --> 4643.759999999999
and it it's different for different

4642.64 --> 4646.64
people

4643.76 --> 4648.64
some people can handle a lot of truth

4646.64 --> 4649.04
and then they have to handle the people

4648.64 --> 4652.08
that

4649.04 --> 4652.64
can't handle that level of truth and

4652.08 --> 4655.92
thus

4652.64 --> 4657.360000000001
it's constantly like that on the entire

4655.92 --> 4665.84
staircase

4657.36 --> 4665.839999999999
of insight

4673.12 --> 4678.64
what are you blabbering about

4676.32 --> 4680.239
making money out of pretending the earth

4678.64 --> 4683.280000000001
is led oh really

4680.239 --> 4686.159
how about the arguments then right

4683.28 --> 4687.84
arguments are not pretense it's not an

4686.159 --> 4690.32
act

4687.84 --> 4691.1990000000005
it's not pretending the earth is flat it

4690.32 --> 4694.96
is

4691.199 --> 4698.159
putting the data together

4694.96 --> 4701.44
and then drawing a logical conclusion

4698.159 --> 4707.839999999999
without bias based on

4701.44 --> 4707.839999999999
religious necessity

4720.32 --> 4723.36
hello getting wisdom

4732.0 --> 4737.12
why why would we do that for you dr

4734.8 --> 4740.56
gonzo are we here to entertain

4737.12 --> 4746.5599999999995
your unwillingness to believe

4740.56 --> 4746.56
really why would we do that what's the

4746.84 --> 4749.84
point

4758.64 --> 4761.84
i mean it could be cool it could be a

4761.52 --> 4764.88
cool

4761.84 --> 4766.56
experience to one time in my life like

4764.88 --> 4769.36
see the ice wall

4766.56 --> 4771.360000000001
in person but not to be like oh i'm

4769.36 --> 4773.36
gonna be also vanier and

4771.36 --> 4776.159
oh i'm going to figure out the scene but

4773.36 --> 4778.96
just to see that it's actually there

4776.159 --> 4781.28
that would be interesting to like have

4778.96 --> 4783.199
confirmed yes there is a nice wall

4781.28 --> 4784.88
it's still there it's not just something

4783.199 --> 4786.5599999999995
from the past

4784.88 --> 4790.2390000000005
that would be kind of cool to experience

4786.56 --> 4793.52
one time other than that i really don't

4790.239 --> 4797.12
don't care too much for that region

4793.52 --> 4797.120000000001
because i don't like cold a lot

4798.32 --> 4802.719
and for me my priorities as to the

4801.679 --> 4804.64
exploration

4802.719 --> 4805.84
of the nature of the realm i'd be more

4804.64 --> 4807.679
interested

4805.84 --> 4809.12
oh shut up an iphone so it's just

4807.679 --> 4812.88
annoying it's not

4809.12 --> 4812.88
funny it's just annoying

4813.679 --> 4819.36
if you continue that sort of thing i'm

4815.12 --> 4833.84
just gonna throw you out

4819.36 --> 4833.839999999999
oh god i hear a cat

4839.52 --> 4847.84
i lost track

4849.12 --> 4852.48
uh yeah ice wall

4853.04 --> 4858.56
would be good to see it someday

4856.639 --> 4862.32
other than that i'm more interested in

4858.56 --> 4865.280000000001
figuring out the geometrical orientation

4862.32 --> 4866.639
things like the equator line so things

4865.28 --> 4870.0
i'm more

4866.639 --> 4873.76
my priorities for true exploration

4870.0 --> 4876.08
are the realm itself the realm we know

4873.76 --> 4877.360000000001
what is the actual orientation right

4876.08 --> 4879.6
everybody's constantly

4877.36 --> 4880.88
just brushing past that it's just like

4879.6 --> 4881.360000000001
oh it's like this oh it's like there's

4880.88 --> 4883.6
no

4881.36 --> 4885.36
reasons counter reasons oh things that

4883.6 --> 4886.159000000001
miss we're just gonna go with this

4885.36 --> 4889.04
anyway

4886.159 --> 4889.599999999999
well how about actually really figuring

4889.04 --> 4892.639
it out

4889.6 --> 4894.8
and not trying to fit it together with

4892.639 --> 4898.56
some presuppositional vantage point

4894.8 --> 4901.28
how about that it's very tough

4898.56 --> 4902.96
just to mentally latch on to that to

4901.28 --> 4907.36
really be

4902.96 --> 4910.4800000000005
absolutely empirical like that

4907.36 --> 4913.5199999999995
right without presupposition

4910.48 --> 4915.759999999999
but that is what is necessary not to to

4913.52 --> 4920.400000000001
look at the ice wall

4915.76 --> 4920.400000000001
to find some edge or a dome

4920.48 --> 4923.678999999999
now i prioritize to actually figure out

4923.36 --> 4926.159
the

4923.679 --> 4927.28
literal geometrical orientation of

4926.159 --> 4931.839999999999
everything that is

4927.28 --> 4931.84
here in the realm

4950.32 --> 4953.679
yeah well why not donate a couple of

4952.719 --> 4956.32
billion

4953.679 --> 4959.84
to my paypal account dr ganzo and i'll

4956.32 --> 4959.84
consider it

4974.08 --> 4978.0
i don't know what the cat's name is it's

4975.76 --> 4980.8
not my cat

4978.0 --> 4982.0
he's just trying to get me to give him

4980.8 --> 4984.320000000001
food again

4982.0 --> 4987.84
because he's always doing that it's the

4984.32 --> 5001.84
only thing he ever does

4987.84 --> 5001.84
but i'm in the middle of the show

5002.24 --> 5005.478999999999
[Music]

5017.36 --> 5022.799999999999
well dr gunzo that's that's very nice

5020.96 --> 5024.8
you do have to realize though that the

5022.8 --> 5026.320000000001
entire world right now is being

5024.8 --> 5029.12
psychologically attacked

5026.32 --> 5029.92
and financially attacked and there is

5029.12 --> 5033.12
like a

5029.92 --> 5036.88
big neo-feudal coup

5033.12 --> 5038.5599999999995
going on worldwide it's being through

5036.88 --> 5041.52
corporations and media

5038.56 --> 5042.080000000001
and politics it's being enforced i think

5041.52 --> 5045.76
we have

5042.08 --> 5049.28
other freaking priorities now then to go

5045.76 --> 5051.52
all in and just

5049.28 --> 5054.159
let's deal with the freaking realm we're

5051.52 --> 5057.1990000000005
living in first yeah

5054.159 --> 5059.92
how about that before we go

5057.199 --> 5071.839999999999
all in into something that's not right

5059.92 --> 5071.84
in front of our noses how about that

5073.28 --> 5076.48
well how about the survival of humanity

5075.6 --> 5080.96
the

5076.48 --> 5083.678999999999
retaining of the individual spirit

5080.96 --> 5084.08
critical thinking right human culture

5083.679 --> 5087.28
that

5084.08 --> 5092.159
the sensible ones

5087.28 --> 5094.96
which are well mostly the older ones

5092.159 --> 5096.638999999999
just the survival of humanity i think it

5094.96 --> 5100.88
is more important than

5096.639 --> 5100.88
fe yeah dr gonzo

5101.36 --> 5104.5599999999995
let's just survive first yeah it's

5103.36 --> 5106.799999999999
really cool to

5104.56 --> 5108.320000000001
figure out flat earth but if that means

5106.8 --> 5111.92
everybody freaking

5108.32 --> 5113.199
dies i think we have other priorities

5111.92 --> 5116.8
yeah

5113.199 --> 5116.799999999999
so stop whining about that

5117.679 --> 5127.84
to deal with the freaking land you're

5120.239 --> 5127.839999999999
standing on

5131.6 --> 5135.85
[Music]

5137.52 --> 5144.159000000001
yeah if we die we die well yeah go ahead

5141.84 --> 5147.1990000000005
you're gonna be like that yeah then why

5144.159 --> 5148.799999999999
not inject yourself with provable poison

5147.199 --> 5150.719
that is said to be something that

5148.8 --> 5153.679
technically it isn't

5150.719 --> 5154.0
admittedly so yeah sure if we die we die

5153.679 --> 5157.6
well

5154.0 --> 5160.8
go ahead then if you want to

5157.6 --> 5166.2390000000005
die for your denial then

5160.8 --> 5166.2390000000005
go ahead i don't care

5166.32 --> 5172.639
your unwillingness to face

5169.36 --> 5183.839999999999
the facts to save your own skin

5172.639 --> 5183.84
is not my freaking problem

5189.16 --> 5192.199
[Music]

5212.88 --> 5220.2390000000005
yeah i know iron 26

5216.96 --> 5223.679
they did do that i was there

5220.239 --> 5227.12
or well i was watching wasn't really

5223.679 --> 5229.36
participating in it but yes there were

5227.12 --> 5229.84
some interesting revelations about the

5229.36 --> 5233.04
sun's

5229.84 --> 5236.84
orientation over the earth and it didn't

5233.04 --> 5240.88
really match up any standardized

5236.84 --> 5243.04
maps that's very fascinating

5240.88 --> 5244.8
and it's just the beginning it just

5243.04 --> 5245.76
reveals like there's something weird

5244.8 --> 5248.96
going on

5245.76 --> 5252.0
with the layout and the celestials

5248.96 --> 5255.12
look guys maybe

5252.0 --> 5258.8
the celestial orientation

5255.12 --> 5262.32
the heavenly bodies are not

5258.8 --> 5265.6
as euclidean linear

5262.32 --> 5268.239
as we have been told they are ever

5265.6 --> 5270.88
considered that

5268.239 --> 5273.599999999999
maybe the equator line is not even a

5270.88 --> 5276.8
perfectly straight line in any form

5273.6 --> 5280.08
maybe it's actually kind of irregular

5276.8 --> 5281.360000000001
it's just that for convenience of the

5280.08 --> 5285.08
belief the earth being in

5281.36 --> 5288.4
ball spinning underneath it's all been

5285.08 --> 5290.88
equalized on the map in order to

5288.4 --> 5293.5199999999995
make that sun appear to go like a

5290.88 --> 5296.639
perfect straight line over the earth

5293.52 --> 5299.120000000001
right so maybe the celestial

5296.639 --> 5299.84
orientation of the lights isn't even as

5299.12 --> 5304.48
perfectly

5299.84 --> 5307.28
linearly consistent as we believe it is

5304.48 --> 5308.08
ever thought of that yeah then it gets

5307.28 --> 5311.44
really

5308.08 --> 5314.48
weird even tougher

5311.44 --> 5315.199
even tougher to figure out but it could

5314.48 --> 5317.36
be

5315.199 --> 5319.879999999999
and that's why it's very important to

5317.36 --> 5322.96
figure out

5319.88 --> 5327.04
orientation of the equator line as a

5322.96 --> 5331.28
vantage point as a start just the start

5327.04 --> 5334.08
doesn't end it it's just the start

5331.28 --> 5335.12
then we can figure out okay what what is

5334.08 --> 5338.5599999999995
this place

5335.12 --> 5340.88
the one that we are in what is it

5338.56 --> 5343.1990000000005
besides flat how does this all

5340.88 --> 5346.719
interconnect what is the actual

5343.199 --> 5349.199
celestial orientation there may be an

5346.719 --> 5350.08
irregular pattern the way the celestial

5349.199 --> 5352.159
bodies display

5350.08 --> 5354.5599999999995
themselves in relation to the earth and

5352.159 --> 5355.599999999999
it might not be as perfectly linearly

5354.56 --> 5359.92
connected

5355.6 --> 5365.84
as i personally have assumed always yeah

5359.92 --> 5365.84
we don't know

5372.239 --> 5376.4
no it wouldn't dr gonzo it would never

5374.96 --> 5379.84
end

5376.4 --> 5382.638999999999
glowers will never concede

5379.84 --> 5383.28
ever doesn't matter what happens could

5382.639 --> 5387.36
literally

5383.28 --> 5389.44
be an yeah a humanoid species coming

5387.36 --> 5391.679
into the realm from another island

5389.44 --> 5395.36
documenting their entire travel

5391.679 --> 5398.32
explaining how that works

5395.36 --> 5398.96
and the freaking globbers would still

5398.32 --> 5402.0
say

5398.96 --> 5403.12
the earth is a [ __ ] globe okay it

5402.0 --> 5404.96
doesn't matter

5403.12 --> 5406.239
it doesn't matter what is done you'll

5404.96 --> 5408.32
never stop saying

5406.239 --> 5410.32
the earth is a globe because you have no

5408.32 --> 5414.48
choice

5410.32 --> 5414.48
you prioritized actually knowing

5414.88 --> 5422.2390000000005
under a very specific outcome

5420.08 --> 5423.6
that's what religion does and there's a

5422.239 --> 5425.599999999999
lot of people like that

5423.6 --> 5428.56
so it's not gonna matter whatever

5425.6 --> 5430.719
happens it doesn't matter you'll still

5428.56 --> 5432.96
say the earth could be a globe you'll

5430.719 --> 5435.28
still say it

5432.96 --> 5437.36
because it will never stop does it

5435.28 --> 5440.239
doesn't matter what happens

5437.36 --> 5440.88
people will always there will always be

5440.239 --> 5443.12
people

5440.88 --> 5444.639
that say the earth is a globe always

5443.12 --> 5449.84
forever

5444.639 --> 5449.84
until the end of the last human being

5458.85 --> 5463.52
[Music]

5460.159 --> 5468.799999999999
yeah well i don't need you dr gonzo

5463.52 --> 5468.8
you see i don't give a [ __ ] what you do

5468.88 --> 5472.08
yeah i don't give a [ __ ] whether you

5471.36 --> 5475.599999999999
believe

5472.08 --> 5478.719
in flat earth or the globe i don't care

5475.6 --> 5481.92
it's your problem yeah

5478.719 --> 5486.0
i'm not gonna dedicate my entire

5481.92 --> 5488.2390000000005
life to your psychological problem

5486.0 --> 5490.96
like that yeah that's not what i'm doing

5488.239 --> 5495.36
this way i'm giving you the opportunity

5490.96 --> 5497.44
to do it yourself right your problem

5495.36 --> 5500.48
yeah it is your problem your global

5497.44 --> 5503.599999999999
belief is your problem

5500.48 --> 5508.48
that's right you're the one that is

5503.6 --> 5508.4800000000005
allowing amnesia to erase

5515.53 --> 5519.84
[Music]

5516.84 --> 5519.84
facts

5536.639 --> 5547.84
yeah iron 26 it's the story of my life

5547.93 --> 5551.049
[Music]

5574.8 --> 5580.08
you're right yeah earth's larp dumpster

5578.159 --> 5582.08
fire

5580.08 --> 5584.48
yeah billionaires don't give a [ __ ]

5582.08 --> 5587.44
about the truth because the truth

5584.48 --> 5588.638999999999
only takes away from their power over

5587.44 --> 5591.44
people that are

5588.639 --> 5593.84
saturated with delusion so they

5591.44 --> 5595.12
literally don't really have a priority

5593.84 --> 5597.84
to find out

5595.12 --> 5597.84
it's actually

5598.159 --> 5605.839999999999
yeah in the priority in their priorities

5602.96 --> 5605.84
that it doesn't

5608.08 --> 5612.4
that it that it that it's not progress

5610.88 --> 5615.4400000000005
that just sticks to what it is

5612.4 --> 5618.4
or hopefully degenerates further

5615.44 --> 5619.759999999999
because the the very powerful in control

5618.4 --> 5621.759999999999
people that

5619.76 --> 5623.76
basically have declared war against the

5621.76 --> 5626.2390000000005
entirety of humanity

5623.76 --> 5628.08
with them on top parasiting on them like

5626.239 --> 5631.199
slaves

5628.08 --> 5634.96
and cattle

5631.199 --> 5637.28
they they don't care they don't care if

5634.96 --> 5638.4
you are a literal brain dead zombie as

5637.28 --> 5641.44
long as you do

5638.4 --> 5641.92
what the [ __ ] they want you to do you

5641.44 --> 5645.12
get it

5641.92 --> 5645.6
they don't care they don't care they

5645.12 --> 5647.599999999999
don't

5645.6 --> 5649.52
care so of course they're not going to

5647.6 --> 5653.120000000001
spend money

5649.52 --> 5656.2390000000005
on things they'll actually take

5653.12 --> 5658.8
humanity or some people in humanity away

5656.239 --> 5660.799999999999
from being brain dead zombie they're not

5658.8 --> 5663.84
gonna spend money on that they're only

5660.8 --> 5664.400000000001
going to spend money on showing how

5663.84 --> 5667.4400000000005
[ __ ]

5664.4 --> 5669.199
egocentric and rich they are

5667.44 --> 5670.638999999999
and that they're better than you because

5669.199 --> 5673.12
they are rich and you are

5670.639 --> 5674.88
poor because they tell you how to be

5673.12 --> 5676.159
poor because you have to be otherwise

5674.88 --> 5687.84
you're guilty

5676.159 --> 5687.839999999999
yeah that's what they do

5688.17 --> 5691.369
[Music]

5696.14 --> 5701.039000000001
[Music]

5723.199 --> 5727.36
oh dr gonzo if you want to see the ice

5725.679 --> 5730.639
wall so badly

5727.36 --> 5743.839999999999
go and see the ice woman but

5730.639 --> 5743.84
you go to the ice wall and see it

5755.84 --> 5757.92
you

5771.04 --> 5777.679
no no it wouldn't dr gunzo nothing

5774.239 --> 5783.119
is going to end your ball belief

5777.679 --> 5783.119
nothing nothing nothing

5783.6 --> 5799.84
you could always reason your way out of

5785.36 --> 5799.839999999999
it you know it

5810.84 --> 5813.84
so

5824.84 --> 5827.84
hmm

5827.92 --> 5833.04
know why the gradient

5831.6 --> 5835.6
well probably because of relative

5833.04 --> 5838.8
density

5835.6 --> 5841.84
which tends to split things up into

5838.8 --> 5846.2390000000005
different densities and then of course

5841.84 --> 5846.2390000000005
there's the dynamic influence of heat

5846.32 --> 5849.199
at ground level

5849.76 --> 5855.76
but yeah gradients set in that's what

5852.0 --> 5859.119
they do

5855.76 --> 5860.96
but they only do that if the available

5859.119 --> 5863.44
volume of a container is met

5860.96 --> 5865.119
that's when gradients happen with

5863.44 --> 5866.638999999999
anything

5865.119 --> 5883.839999999999
there's a vacuum somewhere it's not

5866.639 --> 5883.84
gonna happen it's gonna rush into it

5891.199 --> 5898.239
so is the pressure increasing no

5894.96 --> 5904.0
it's pretty stable that's

5898.239 --> 5904.0
but it is fluctuating on a daily cycle

5904.159 --> 5907.28
if it cools down the pressure is going

5906.0 --> 5908.96
to change slightly

5907.28 --> 5912.5599999999995
and if it warms up the pressure is going

5908.96 --> 5912.56
to change slightly that's just what

5922.84 --> 5925.84
happens

5935.679 --> 5940.2390000000005
yes i was a bummington because gas is

5938.48 --> 5944.04
not only being produced

5940.239 --> 5947.04
at ground level it's also being

5944.04 --> 5950.8
reabsorbed and transformed

5947.04 --> 5956.159
at ground level yeah

5950.8 --> 5956.159000000001
it's a lot of cycling going on at ground

5964.84 --> 5967.84
level

5975.16 --> 5978.32
[Music]

5976.56 --> 5979.84
and then no additional pressure at

5978.32 --> 5980.799999999999
ground level yes there is because

5979.84 --> 5984.0
there's constant

5980.8 --> 5987.76
or well there's regular heat down there

5984.0 --> 5990.88
right and the heat the daily heat

5987.76 --> 5994.0
for whatever amount is generated it

5990.88 --> 5999.52
it causes pressure

5994.0 --> 5999.52
locally it just does

6004.239 --> 6007.718999999999
then that pressure is within the

6006.639 --> 6011.76
container

6007.719 --> 6012.719
redistributed and that contributes to

6011.76 --> 6015.1990000000005
the gradient

6012.719 --> 6016.159
but even if there wasn't this situation

6015.199 --> 6017.839999999999
going on

6016.159 --> 6021.28
there would still be a gradient because

6017.84 --> 6023.1990000000005
it's a very large container

6021.28 --> 6027.44
and yeah there's a lot of room for

6023.199 --> 6027.44
relative density to have an influence

6034.08 --> 6037.84
what the [ __ ] are you blaming about

6043.119 --> 6050.4
okay colin jowly please stop

6046.8 --> 6065.84
posting one word posts

6050.4 --> 6065.839999999999
thank you very much

6071.119 --> 6074.32
oh really pressure doesn't change so

6073.119 --> 6078.119
what about weather

6074.32 --> 6081.5199999999995
then what about the actual registered

6078.119 --> 6083.119
meteorological pressure changes

6081.52 --> 6084.719
that doesn't happen either larry the

6083.119 --> 6088.239
march

6084.719 --> 6092.0
so there's no winds caused by

6088.239 --> 6096.0
pressure change is there

6092.0 --> 6100.88
larry the march i think you made a

6096.0 --> 6100.88
little mistake there pretty sure there

6104.84 --> 6107.84
is

6109.84 --> 6112.159000000001
okay

6117.28 --> 6120.48
you can be suck somewhere else and if

6120.239 --> 6122.239
you

6120.48 --> 6124.4
got something to share then just put it

6122.239 --> 6126.959999999999
all in one sentence and don't spam my

6124.4 --> 6134.08
chat with singular word posts thank you

6126.96 --> 6136.4
very much

6134.08 --> 6137.92
larry tomorrow so there is a change then

6136.4 --> 6138.638999999999
yeah there is pressure change isn't

6137.92 --> 6142.08
there because

6138.639 --> 6144.56
we got wind sometimes and storms

6142.08 --> 6146.84
yeah you know what that's from pressure

6144.56 --> 6149.04
differentials

6146.84 --> 6163.84
yeah i know

6149.04 --> 6163.84
i know you were wrong i know

6165.04 --> 6167.36
what

6171.44 --> 6178.32
protein pills what the [ __ ]

6174.96 --> 6182.4800000000005
i don't take protein pills

6178.32 --> 6191.84
take vitamin pills herb pills no protein

6182.48 --> 6191.839999999999
thanks although i do take fish oil

6192.56 --> 6198.159000000001
and i don't put a helmet on i'm not a

6195.52 --> 6198.159000000001
helmet guy

6199.199 --> 6205.839999999999
unless i'm on a motorcycle

6213.32 --> 6219.92
meteorological trading

6216.239 --> 6224.0
you mean training ah

6219.92 --> 6228.0
basic meteorology oh i'm wrong

6224.0 --> 6231.04
oh larry march says i'm wrong because

6228.0 --> 6234.159
winds and storms are

6231.04 --> 6238.48
not caused by

6234.159 --> 6241.92
pressure differential in the air

6238.48 --> 6247.119
you know how they show those lower

6241.92 --> 6250.4
and higher pressure charts on the news

6247.119 --> 6252.719
during the weather report yeah

6250.4 --> 6253.679
yeah i don't need meteorological

6252.719 --> 6256.88
training

6253.679 --> 6260.2390000000005
to recognize the l

6256.88 --> 6263.639
and the h for low

6260.239 --> 6265.919999999999
and high pressure yeah i don't need

6263.639 --> 6267.119
meteorological training for that larry

6265.92 --> 6269.1990000000005
the march

6267.119 --> 6270.5599999999995
i just know there is pressure

6269.199 --> 6276.638999999999
differentials and it

6270.56 --> 6276.639
is the cause of wind and storms

6285.199 --> 6293.599999999999
hey dan winfield

6289.679 --> 6293.6
is that you long time no see man

6295.92 --> 6300.84
get a headache from pressure change yes

6298.32 --> 6303.84
yes you can get a headache from that

6300.84 --> 6303.84
definitely

6305.76 --> 6309.76
weather has nothing to do with vertical

6307.6 --> 6314.84
pressure gradient

6309.76 --> 6318.159000000001
oh really so what about the pressure

6314.84 --> 6320.8
changes that causes

6318.159 --> 6320.799999999999
storms

6321.199 --> 6325.28
i'm pretty sure that that's a different

6323.44 --> 6327.36
pressure right so if there's a pressure

6325.28 --> 6331.04
gradient

6327.36 --> 6332.239
well does it not include the pressure

6331.04 --> 6335.84
changes

6332.239 --> 6337.44
close to ground does that is that

6335.84 --> 6339.76
is that not pressure is there no

6337.44 --> 6342.0
pressure difference there

6339.76 --> 6343.280000000001
how can you just say that it has nothing

6342.0 --> 6345.119
to do with

6343.28 --> 6347.679
any gradient because i'm pretty sure

6345.119 --> 6349.36
that a pressure gradient

6347.679 --> 6352.32
is going to be influenced by any

6349.36 --> 6352.32
pressure changes

6357.36 --> 6363.199
yes really oh no oh sure

6360.48 --> 6363.199
whatever man

6366.0 --> 6369.84
you can't fix stupid guys

6370.639 --> 6376.56
my remarks is going to insist

6374.32 --> 6378.719
there is no pressure differential on

6376.56 --> 6381.52
earth

6378.719 --> 6382.719
that doesn't prove the gradients it's

6381.52 --> 6384.56
all very nice

6382.719 --> 6387.84
but yeah i'm done wasting my time on

6384.56 --> 6387.84
that thanks

6399.199 --> 6405.5199999999995
you're stealing that iron

6402.32 --> 6406.5599999999995
26 well it's not really like yeah it's

6405.52 --> 6408.719
oh it's old

6406.56 --> 6410.0
can't fix stupid like one of the first

6408.719 --> 6414.88
internet memes ever

6410.0 --> 6417.84
was can't fix stupid

6414.88 --> 6420.4800000000005
so that's been around for a while but if

6417.84 --> 6420.4800000000005
you like it

6421.119 --> 6429.839999999999
it certainly does seem to be applicable

6425.28 --> 6429.84
to modern day society now doesn't it

6435.14 --> 6439.119000000001
[Music]

6436.96 --> 6441.6
are they even pressure gradients that go

6439.119 --> 6442.88
sideways or just up and down no just up

6441.6 --> 6445.76
and down

6442.88 --> 6445.76
no sideways

6446.4 --> 6449.679
that's the funny thing about it

6450.719 --> 6454.4800000000005
that's why i'm saying that pretty damn

6453.36 --> 6457.04
sure because of the

6454.48 --> 6458.08
share just the orientation alone of

6457.04 --> 6461.04
gradients

6458.08 --> 6463.5199999999995
any gradient that is caused by relative

6461.04 --> 6463.5199999999995
density

6463.92 --> 6466.96
the pressure gradient

6468.48 --> 6475.0599999999995
because yeah the relative density is

6471.52 --> 6478.349
ordered in in that fashion as well

6475.06 --> 6478.349
[Music]

6478.719 --> 6483.199
so yeah if the relative density

6483.4 --> 6490.638999999999
displacement axis

6487.199 --> 6493.678999999999
is vertical

6490.639 --> 6497.6
and every gradient

6493.679 --> 6502.159
ever formed is stacked up

6497.6 --> 6503.76
vertical do you know anything else that

6502.159 --> 6507.599999999999
is so specifically

6503.76 --> 6509.92
vertical in axis in its ordering

6507.6 --> 6512.400000000001
i don't know anything else so i one

6509.92 --> 6514.719
would only have to conclude that

6512.4 --> 6517.36
this case correlation might actually be

6514.719 --> 6517.36
causation

6517.84 --> 6522.4800000000005
right because you have any other

6520.639 --> 6527.84
explanation for that

6522.48 --> 6527.839999999999
i don't

6528.719 --> 6533.679
why is it vertical because that's the

6530.4 --> 6536.4
way it is wilma willington

6533.679 --> 6538.56
wilmington that's the way it's

6536.4 --> 6542.0
orientated

6538.56 --> 6555.84
provably so i'm not gonna waste my time

6542.0 --> 6555.84
on figuring out why

6558.23 --> 6563.759999999999
[Music]

6560.08 --> 6563.76
what is the causation for down

6564.239 --> 6570.718999999999
um density

6568.0 --> 6572.0
of object being higher than density of

6570.719 --> 6583.84
medium

6572.0 --> 6583.84
that's causation for down

6584.8 --> 6597.84
why does something go down because it's

6586.4 --> 6597.839999999999
denser than the medium it's in

6617.44 --> 6625.598999999999
why why because

6621.04 --> 6627.84
who gives a [ __ ] why

6625.599 --> 6629.119000000001
you yeah sorry i'm not gonna help your

6627.84 --> 6633.4400000000005
six years

6629.119 --> 6636.639
you're sick you're six years old self

6633.44 --> 6637.44
with endless why why why whining

6636.639 --> 6639.679
questions

6637.44 --> 6641.04
i can't help you with that at some point

6639.679 --> 6641.84
you're not going to get an answer

6641.04 --> 6644.88
anymore

6641.84 --> 6648.2390000000005
and you will never have your why

6644.88 --> 6651.119
answered so stop whining to me

6648.239 --> 6653.04
about why why the axis why that

6651.119 --> 6656.159
direction yeah i don't know

6653.04 --> 6656.639
you could fantasize all day long about

6656.159 --> 6659.44
it

6656.639 --> 6661.92
give you all kinds of great conceptual

6659.44 --> 6664.5599999999995
structural explanations really cute

6661.92 --> 6666.2390000000005
i can't prove it though so i'm not going

6664.56 --> 6681.84
to waste my time on that

6666.239 --> 6681.839999999999
i just know the way it works

6696.4 --> 6703.36
why do vacuums go up what

6699.92 --> 6705.76
no vacuums don't go up vacuums

6703.36 --> 6707.199
are not things they are the absence of

6705.76 --> 6709.52
pressure

6707.199 --> 6712.0
and they don't go in any direction they

6709.52 --> 6713.84
are simply filled up

6712.0 --> 6715.44
and then whatever it is filled up with

6713.84 --> 6719.679
is going to settle

6715.44 --> 6725.199
and redistribute itself into a gradient

6719.679 --> 6725.1990000000005
if it has the stability to do so

6730.96 --> 6734.719
hello adam meakin by the way good to see

6734.84 --> 6737.84
you

6776.84 --> 6779.84
hmm

6785.84 --> 6792.159000000001
yeah colin jolie it's not that type of a

6788.239 --> 6794.48
law though

6792.159 --> 6795.28
natural laws you can't break because as

6794.48 --> 6797.28
soon as you

6795.28 --> 6800.719
you're able to break a natural law it's

6797.28 --> 6800.719
not a natural law anymore

6802.08 --> 6805.36
but yeah the ones that have been

6803.92 --> 6807.4400000000005
established

6805.36 --> 6809.679
could yeah it could be safely said that

6807.44 --> 6810.879999999999
once it is established something is a

6809.679 --> 6813.92
natural law

6810.88 --> 6816.8
with empirical proof for that

6813.92 --> 6817.84
then it's never going to change ever

6816.8 --> 6820.400000000001
again

6817.84 --> 6821.84
unless like the entire function of the

6820.4 --> 6825.598999999999
realm changes

6821.84 --> 6830.8
somehow dramatically and that

6825.599 --> 6830.8
that doesn't really help as far as i

6832.84 --> 6835.84
know

6882.56 --> 6891.84
oh come on get out of here

6893.84 --> 6897.04

how things are going to roll out in the

6951.36 --> 6955.44
next month

6953.199 --> 6956.239
because it could be quite chaotic i

6955.44 --> 6958.0
don't know yet

6956.239 --> 6960.32
that's also part of reason why i'm kind

6958.0 --> 6964.08
of nervous right but i am going to

6960.32 --> 6967.84
go to the appointment in half an hour
