79.439 --> 82.15899999999999
weather today

82.24 --> 87.83999999999999
it kind of started out a bit cloudy but

84.159 --> 87.84
right now there's this beautiful

88.799 --> 92.72000000000001
blue spot with nice some

93.52 --> 97.03999999999999
it's been raining

95.759 --> 99.2
here and there

97.04 --> 101.84
even during the night

99.2 --> 101.84
not a lot though

102.479 --> 109.799
still some wind but it's yeah it's not

105.28 --> 109.799
like constant anymore at least

114.32 --> 119.15899999999999
so yeah it looks

115.84 --> 119.159
pretty beautiful

129.2 --> 134.23899999999998
hello america silva patriot first in

131.2 --> 141.07999999999998
chat how are you doing

134.239 --> 141.08
it is friday the 25th of february 2022

146.56 --> 152.239
i feel a bit better than yesterday

149.04 --> 156.76
although not a lot i'm still

152.239 --> 156.76
there's something's going on down there

157.28 --> 161.519
so

158.8 --> 165.28
i'm rolling i'm enrolling myself in my

161.519 --> 165.28
own made recovery program

166.64 --> 170.55999999999997
and i i really do think it's mostly just

169.36 --> 173.36
stress

170.56 --> 175.92000000000002
including like dark world related stress

173.36 --> 178.8
because it is very stressful

175.92 --> 181.44
that's why yesterday i said like i wish

178.8 --> 185.15900000000002
i i'd never

181.44 --> 185.159
that that never happened

186.8 --> 191.44
because it's just very burdensome at

189.44 --> 195.28
times

191.44 --> 195.28
like when things are stressing out

195.92 --> 201.67999999999998
it's like tapping into it is actually

199.04 --> 201.67999999999998
almost like

201.76 --> 205.84
normal people would just go crazy

204.48 --> 208.959
with me

205.84 --> 211.519
what happens is this thing manifests

208.959 --> 213.28
more clearly to my conscious

211.519 --> 217.04
and it is crazy

213.28 --> 220.64000000000001
but it is also kind of cohesive but

217.04 --> 222.319
not as much as i'd like to

220.64 --> 225.11999999999998
it's almost like

222.319 --> 228.48
somehow i managed to control my own

225.12 --> 230.87900000000002
insanity it's very weird

228.48 --> 235.11999999999998
and it's not healthy it's not healthy to

230.879 --> 238.0
do that so especially when i'm weakened

235.12 --> 240.72
yeah i could technically jump right in

238.0 --> 241.92
but it's really bad for me

240.72 --> 245.439
understand

241.92 --> 247.28
it's bad it's physically

245.439 --> 249.35999999999999
well burdensome

247.28 --> 250.56
and when i'm not strong it's actually

249.36 --> 252.799
damaging

250.56 --> 254.72
so that's tough because when everybody

252.799 --> 255.84
stresses out everyone is looking for

254.72 --> 257.68
answers

255.84 --> 260.959
so that's exactly

257.68 --> 263.68
when i'll typically be called to do that

260.959 --> 266.72
it's actually not a very healthy setup

263.68 --> 266.72
when i think about it

267.12 --> 269.84000000000003
but

272.4 --> 278.56
i guess that

275.199 --> 281.759
when my brilliant

278.56 --> 284.24
subconscious desire yeah

281.759 --> 286.47900000000004
this so he didn't think it through that

284.24 --> 286.479
much

287.44 --> 291.44
just goes to show lack of wisdom

295.36 --> 300.24
in my past when i made these decisions

301.12 --> 305.919
and i i literally rushed it

304.08 --> 310.08
i didn't have the wisdom

305.919 --> 313.12
and i'm very sorry towards myself

310.08 --> 313.12
and towards god

321.199 --> 325.68
hello mike

322.84 --> 327.919
sedonach right but yeah yesterday i was

325.68 --> 329.199
just

327.919 --> 332.639
the tension

329.199 --> 332.639
was still hanging around

334.16 --> 339.6
and then i literally just like my food

337.68 --> 341.52
wasn't digesting it was just sitting

339.6 --> 344.0
there in my stomach and then i got sick

341.52 --> 346.4
and i threw it all up and then i didn't

344.0 --> 349.199
need anything after that point

346.4 --> 350.32
but i felt fine though

349.199 --> 353.199
it's like

350.32 --> 355.84
it just wouldn't it just wouldn't go

353.199 --> 357.84000000000003
through like it was blocked

355.84 --> 361.71999999999997
and i was just not hungry even though i

357.84 --> 361.71999999999997
was eating it's weird

366.72 --> 371.28000000000003
don't over stress

368.319 --> 371.28000000000003
i'm trying not to

377.919 --> 380.919
right

382.56 --> 387.759
it's just there is a lot going on in the

384.96 --> 389.039
world right now

387.759 --> 391.039
and i'm just

389.039 --> 393.59999999999997
kind of like

391.039 --> 396.0
i'm not really totally in it i'm like a

393.6 --> 397.91900000000004
little bit on the sideline wondering

396.0 --> 400.24
should i

397.919 --> 402.56
dig into this

400.24 --> 405.8
with what i do

402.56 --> 405.8
i'm hesitant

408.0 --> 412.08
when i yeah i first realized that was

410.319 --> 413.91900000000004
basically the moment that on my show i

412.08 --> 417.68
said i can't handle this anymore it's

413.919 --> 417.68
like i feel like i'm not

418.96 --> 423.68
supposed to

421.12 --> 426.319
deal with this

423.68 --> 426.319
it's odd

429.12 --> 433.599
but yeah

430.8 --> 437.44
i'm kind of indirectly forced to do

433.599 --> 439.759
something with it anyway

437.44 --> 442.0
because everybody's now thinking about

439.759 --> 442.8
what's going on in the world and canada

442.0 --> 445.36
and

442.8 --> 445.36
russia

447.44 --> 449.68
right

448.8 --> 454.52000000000004
so

449.68 --> 454.52
borders boy the other andrew

473.44 --> 481.52
right so i'm gonna have to basically

476.879 --> 481.52000000000004
be very careful with my food management

482.24 --> 486.96000000000004
because i feel like i can eat less

485.52 --> 489.12
it's like

486.96 --> 492.23999999999995
it's like when

489.12 --> 495.52
you're sick

492.24 --> 498.72
except it's just like the recovery cycle

495.52 --> 501.35999999999996
and not like oh i have this very

498.72 --> 502.72
blatantly obvious sickness symptoms or

501.36 --> 506.08000000000004
anything

502.72 --> 508.319
like oh i have to coughs or if oh if

506.08 --> 510.71999999999997
sinus infection or any no it's nothing

508.319 --> 512.399
like that but

510.72 --> 515.44
the rest

512.399 --> 515.44
seems to be there

516.159 --> 523.36
like my body is going in a regeneration

518.959 --> 525.68
thing it's it's very odd it's very odd

523.36 --> 527.6800000000001
for me to like

525.68 --> 530.16
size up what's really happening to me

527.68 --> 530.16
sometimes

532.88 --> 537.76
oh price

534.88 --> 540.0
where's that borders boy

537.76 --> 542.08
yeah there's there's inflation stuff

540.0 --> 545.519
happening all over the place

542.08 --> 548.519
i'm noticing it here too it's it's very

545.519 --> 548.519
unnerving

549.44 --> 554.8000000000001
hey steamy traveler

551.839 --> 556.72
yeah by the way i want to fl he's not

554.8 --> 559.3599999999999

556.72 --> 562.88

575.44 --> 579.6
so happy to have you flatter sage

580.16 --> 583.4399999999999
the guy really gets it

586.399 --> 590.08
and he does it's not just saying that

588.16 --> 591.92
because he's giving me money he actually

590.08 --> 594.24
i feel it like

591.92 --> 596.3199999999999
when i roll out things like complicated

594.24 --> 599.04
subtle things he picks up on it i can

596.32 --> 600.88
feel it i can feel it through

599.04 --> 602.8389999999999
the timing

600.88 --> 606.64
and the frequency

602.839 --> 611.2
like the energy behind his responses

606.64 --> 613.12
and a lot of you by the way but he's

611.2 --> 614.88
he's sharp but he's also got a lot of

613.12 --> 617.279
great energy i love it

614.88 --> 617.279
anyway

617.6 --> 620.88
uh

618.959 --> 624.64
hi steamy traveler

620.88 --> 624.64
hope i'm feeling better yeah a little

630.72 --> 636.48
fruits and vegetables they get infested

633.36 --> 636.48
doesn't stay fresh

637.2 --> 640.399
okay that's not very specific though a

639.279 --> 641.6
uk

640.399 --> 643.839
right

641.6 --> 643.839
uh

649.2 --> 654.0
well that's the thing about war

652.0 --> 657.12
wars always

654.0 --> 661.72
base yeah whatever is going on like with

657.12 --> 661.72
actual soldiers and weapons

661.92 --> 666.64
the economics always is like the most

665.36 --> 669.839
noticeable

666.64 --> 671.4399999999999
about wars what happens

669.839 --> 674.6400000000001
like certain

671.44 --> 676.9590000000001
transports are cut off

674.64 --> 679.36
like so you thought that oh supplying

676.959 --> 681.68
chain issues right due to stupid

679.36 --> 684.48
lockdowns and all that that that was a

681.68 --> 686.88
problem well guess what

684.48 --> 689.2
wars

686.88 --> 691.36
tend to like do that

689.2 --> 693.519
a lot more

691.36 --> 694.48
and there's already yeah this yeah but

693.519 --> 696.079
there's so

694.48 --> 698.8000000000001
there's a lot of screwing around

696.079 --> 700.8389999999999
happening there's like sabotage there's

698.8 --> 705.12
economic industrial

700.839 --> 705.12
self-sabotage happening around the world

705.68 --> 710.6389999999999
like these gas and oil

708.32 --> 712.0
pipelines are just cut off for no damn

710.639 --> 715.279
reason

712.0 --> 718.399
or for supposed climate demands which is

715.279 --> 721.4399999999999
absolutely idiotic

718.399 --> 724.959
like doesn't make any sense like

721.44 --> 726.8000000000001
the actual pollution caused by

724.959 --> 729.5189999999999
the damage

726.8 --> 731.3599999999999
the backlash of just

729.519 --> 733.6
a whole bunch of people counting on it

731.36 --> 735.36
not being able to get around anymore

733.6 --> 738.16
they all have to like

735.36 --> 740.0
do radical things that they normally

738.16 --> 741.8389999999999
wouldn't never do

740.0 --> 746.16
and those things are actually more

741.839 --> 746.1600000000001
polluting on average yeah

746.56 --> 750.2399999999999
right

747.519 --> 753.839
so it's even environmentally completely

750.24 --> 753.839
counterproductive to do this

753.92 --> 757.519
if the if they're actually going to use

755.6 --> 760.0
that as an excuse

757.519 --> 762.88
it's just pure sabotage and it's

760.0 --> 762.88
terrible like

764.639 --> 769.5600000000001
in a way you could almost say that

766.72 --> 772.9590000000001
because they've like yeah the

769.56 --> 776.88
globalists have done that

772.959 --> 781.4399999999999
it it kind of gave putin just a

776.88 --> 783.12
yeah a clean opportunity to just do this

781.44 --> 784.8000000000001
because there's going to be backlashes

783.12 --> 787.12
anyway he was going to get blamed for

784.8 --> 789.4399999999999
whatever is going to happen anyway so he

787.12 --> 792.32
can just get away with it it's

789.44 --> 792.32
complicated

796.399 --> 799.399
right

801.76 --> 804.16
anyway

804.56 --> 807.92
putin can kiss my ass

808.32 --> 814.0400000000001
dude

809.839 --> 814.0400000000001
you're an idiot baldy cats

816.399 --> 821.36
now putin's definitely a man that

818.639 --> 823.76
deserves respect he's very good at what

821.36 --> 823.76
he does

823.839 --> 828.519
and he is remarkably honest

828.8 --> 835.199
for a political leader he really is

831.44 --> 835.1990000000001
he's tactical but he is

835.279 --> 837.4399999999999
like

838.32 --> 844.5600000000001
he's not nefarious he actually wants to

840.8 --> 844.56
stabilize things on average

846.56 --> 849.68
no lolly cats

850.56 --> 853.959
no he doesn't

860.32 --> 865.12
hey flatter sage thanks for the paypal

862.88 --> 865.12
man

867.199 --> 872.4799999999999
yeah oh oh he said that did he baldy

870.0 --> 876.079
cats yeah that's called strategy it's

872.48 --> 876.0790000000001
called strategy dumbass

876.16 --> 879.48
hold on

887.199 --> 891.7199999999999
all right goddamn troll again

903.76 --> 907.199
it's also called lying

908.0 --> 913.6
now it's it's called minimizing damage

910.839 --> 916.48
yeah it's called

913.6 --> 919.12
we don't want to start a panic so just

916.48 --> 922.0
quickly do it

919.12 --> 925.0
it's government he's still a government

922.0 --> 925.0

963.44 --> 969.0400000000001

hey thank you bex for the

please tell me yeah

1016.0 --> 1019.199
well support him it's none of my

1018.0 --> 1022.48
business

1019.199 --> 1022.4799999999999
it's none of your business

1023.04 --> 1027.28
yeah the geopolitical situation is what

1025.36 --> 1029.9189999999999
has been happening over there

1027.28 --> 1032.6399999999999
it's been quite egregious for a while

1029.919 --> 1035.76
against russia

1032.64 --> 1038.0790000000002
like nato has been breaking deals

1035.76 --> 1039.6
and they're slandering constantly and

1038.079 --> 1042.3999999999999
they're censoring and they're like

1039.6 --> 1044.799
literally lying

1042.4 --> 1046.5590000000002
about what is said in in mainstream

1044.799 --> 1049.36
media that gets spread around to

1046.559 --> 1053.48
everybody it's egregious

1049.36 --> 1053.4799999999998
so putin is being

1053.679 --> 1058.72
actually quite

1055.84 --> 1058.72
quite measured

1060.559 --> 1063.6
about his actions

1063.84 --> 1066.799
okay

1065.12 --> 1070.3999999999999
yeah but they're trying to they were

1066.799 --> 1071.6
trying to get that to happen

1070.4 --> 1074.48
right

1071.6 --> 1077.28
and moving in weapons just giving them

1074.48 --> 1079.52
giant amounts of weapons

1077.28 --> 1081.6789999999999
yeah

1079.52 --> 1084.08
oh oh they don't officially well if

1081.679 --> 1085.039
they're going to effectively become like

1084.08 --> 1087.4399999999998
a

1085.039 --> 1089.2
weaponized front for nato doesn't matter

1087.44 --> 1091.52
if they're gonna sign on to some

1089.2 --> 1093.6000000000001
agreement or not

1091.52 --> 1095.28
it's it's all the same

1093.6 --> 1098.0
right because the whole agreement was

1095.28 --> 1100.3999999999999
about where you moved the weapons

1098.0 --> 1103.919
and russia just the part of the treaty

1100.4 --> 1104.88
was core part is not to have nato move

1103.919 --> 1107.2
in

1104.88 --> 1109.919
a lot of weapons at the edge of russia's

1107.2 --> 1112.559
border that was it that was always it

1109.919 --> 1114.5590000000002
and they've been constantly

1112.559 --> 1119.12
chipping and nato has been chipping away

1114.559 --> 1121.84
at that and just acting super arrogant

1119.12 --> 1123.28
so russia russia's response is very

1121.84 --> 1125.76
measured

1123.28 --> 1129.039
and justified in my opinion

1125.76 --> 1131.76
not saying that i like it

1129.039 --> 1133.36
it doesn't yeah it is worrisome

1131.76 --> 1134.799
it's always worse than when these kind

1133.36 --> 1137.84
of things happen but

1134.799 --> 1137.84
it's very measured

1143.52 --> 1149.12
it doesn't matter it's not about that

1145.679 --> 1150.72
bali cats and by the way nato has been

1149.12 --> 1153.52
ravaging

1150.72 --> 1153.52
the middle east

1153.679 --> 1158.3200000000002
and

1155.2 --> 1160.72
what is it uh libya so yeah that that

1158.32 --> 1164.76
was the last time several times in the

1160.72 --> 1164.76
last two decades yeah

1165.2 --> 1170.0
is not on the border but moving in

1167.2 --> 1172.64
weapons was part of that deal

1170.0 --> 1176.6
not to do that and they and nato broke

1172.64 --> 1176.6000000000001
it so it doesn't matter

1179.679 --> 1182.679
okay

1208.24 --> 1213.36
yeah borders boy that's right and i

1210.48 --> 1213.3600000000001
warned about this

1213.76 --> 1217.6
most of the war is going to be deep

1215.44 --> 1219.76
faked

1217.6 --> 1221.52
it's just constantly like oh troops

1219.76 --> 1225.36
everything's blowing up

1221.52 --> 1227.9189999999999
it's just not happening like that at all

1225.36 --> 1229.76
russians don't have an interest putin

1227.919 --> 1232.0
doesn't have an interest in destroying

1229.76 --> 1232.84
ukraine

1232.0 --> 1234.64
you

1232.84 --> 1236.72
understand

1234.64 --> 1238.48
they don't want to destroy it

1236.72 --> 1241.2
like russians work there they have

1238.48 --> 1243.1200000000001
families there like it's

1241.2 --> 1246.0800000000002
they have very

1243.12 --> 1247.76
close ties everywhere that you just

1246.08 --> 1249.84
don't understand what the [ __ ] this

1247.76 --> 1253.12
situation really is you've been

1249.84 --> 1255.36
indoctrinated by the deep fake media

1253.12 --> 1257.039
that is just constantly

1255.36 --> 1260.799
hyping it up

1257.039 --> 1260.799
rolling out fear porn about it

1260.96 --> 1266.159
did you not watch me yeah i did

1264.08 --> 1268.96
watched every one of them and it's all

1266.159 --> 1268.96
super measured

1271.919 --> 1277.7990000000002
yeah orange revolution ukraine was it

1274.08 --> 1277.799
was a giant mess

1278.559 --> 1283.12
like there's don't you guys get it you

1297.6 --> 1302.32
guys don't know

1300.08 --> 1306.24
what that actually means

1302.32 --> 1306.24
like what those types of people do

1306.32 --> 1310.28
you have no idea

1319.12 --> 1325.6
right i'm not talking about

1321.52 --> 1327.52
stupid media accusation nazis or sjw

1325.6 --> 1331.28
that call everybody nazis that's

1327.52 --> 1333.2
complete horseshit no actual

1331.28 --> 1335.12
the actual

1333.2 --> 1338.0800000000002
code

1335.12 --> 1340.8799999999999
of how like ss and all that were trained

1338.08 --> 1347.08
and then modernized and weird and

1340.88 --> 1347.0800000000002
liberalized ugh sorry it's just ah

1354.48 --> 1358.48
should we invade holland huh

1358.88 --> 1364.72
why are they a threat

1361.36 --> 1367.6789999999999
are they in the government openly saying

1364.72 --> 1372.24
openly taking control

1367.679 --> 1372.24
because that was happening in ukraine

1372.96 --> 1377.76
they like have a military force there

1387.28 --> 1389.84
right

1392.24 --> 1396.4
by the way i'd like to say that i really

1394.4 --> 1398.799
even though i consciously didn't even

1396.4 --> 1401.6000000000001
understand it deeply but i did watch

1398.799 --> 1402.72
carefully i really called the deep fake

1401.6 --> 1405.28
war

1402.72 --> 1406.64
i really really called it i knew it was

1405.28 --> 1410.8799999999999
gonna happen

1406.64 --> 1410.88
like it's even happening on alex jones

1412.72 --> 1416.039
even there

1418.08 --> 1422.32
and they'll still give like some honest

1420.4 --> 1425.1200000000001
smart criticism in between but not

1422.32 --> 1426.72
before they roll out all the footage and

1425.12 --> 1428.84
the explosions oh look at the

1426.72 --> 1431.84
helicopters look at all the flares oh no

1428.84 --> 1434.48

a psych bear

1458.559 --> 1461.76
ah man i'm

1460.4 --> 1463.8400000000001
certainly feeling stronger than

1461.76 --> 1465.919
yesterday it's good

1463.84 --> 1470.36
i guess i'm picking up where i left off

1465.919 --> 1470.3600000000001
except now i'm more cohesive

1479.279 --> 1482.48
that's right borders boy

1485.039 --> 1490.559
like why would they even do that right

1488.24 --> 1493.36

is literally gonna make everybody super

1493.36 --> 1498.32

1498.96 --> 1502.559
like how is that going to stabilize

1500.559 --> 1505.6
things it wouldn't that's why they don't

1502.559 --> 1507.6
do it even though oh russia's attacking

1505.6 --> 1510.24

question because i know you don't have

1538.4 --> 1543.279
the faculties or like the will

1541.44 --> 1545.1200000000001
to actually get a grip on how that

1543.279 --> 1547.84
really works bali cats

1595.12 --> 1598.9599999999998
restrained very alert

always remember it's

1598.96 --> 1604.64
you're there to keep order

1601.279 --> 1606.88
not to just show off your power

1604.64 --> 1606.88
right

1609.679 --> 1613.8400000000001
right because i'll take it away just as

1611.279 --> 1613.84
easily

1626.83 --> 1630.03
[Music]

1636.24 --> 1641.36
what disorder existed in ukraine

1639.2 --> 1646.159
uh media

1641.36 --> 1646.1589999999999
literally calling for war with russia

1649.6 --> 1655.039
as they were getting weapons new weapons

1652.64 --> 1657.6000000000001
updated weaponry

1655.039 --> 1661.76
from the west

1657.6 --> 1661.76
yeah let's call that a disorder

1662.24 --> 1667.3990000000001
but you didn't know anything about that

1664.159 --> 1667.3990000000001
did you

1674.159 --> 1677.1200000000001
when did the mean

1675.52 --> 1679.36
well it might have not been like the

1677.12 --> 1681.1999999999998
state media

1679.36 --> 1683.1999999999998
but groups

1681.2 --> 1687.1200000000001
let's just say through social media

1683.2 --> 1687.1200000000001
there was things being organized there

1690.559 --> 1695.12
right the fact remains is that there's a

1692.48 --> 1697.3600000000001
lot of weapons that basically moved into

1695.12 --> 1700.32
the country

1697.36 --> 1704.0

1700.32 --> 1704.0

1746.64 --> 1750.0

if you actually care about the subject

1752.72 --> 1759.1200000000001
you clearly don't you're just panicking

1755.84 --> 1759.12

1831.84 --> 1838.72
real expert but compared to

1834.84 --> 1840.559
you they are

1838.72 --> 1842.799
they're actually people that like to

1840.559 --> 1845.36
generally be informed about what they're

1842.799 --> 1848.48
talking about and not just resort to

1845.36 --> 1848.4799999999998
mass hysteria

1849.36 --> 1853.4799999999998

1974.0 --> 1979.44
lot of that in the past

1976.72 --> 1982.3990000000001
in other regions in the world

1979.44 --> 1985.039
right like iraq and afghanistan and

1982.399 --> 1987.36
syria

1985.039 --> 1988.84
libya yeah there's a lot of that over

1987.36 --> 1990.399
there

1988.84 --> 1992.559
huh

1990.399 --> 1994.32
yeah no but they don't actually blow up

1992.559 --> 1997.12
people's houses

1994.32 --> 1999.12
because most of those people are

1997.12 --> 2000.9599999999998
literally related they don't want to

1999.12 --> 2003.12
blow up people's houses they don't want

2000.96 --> 2005.1200000000001
to blow up weddings they don't want to

2003.12 --> 2007.6789999999999
create a war they want to stabilize it

2005.12 --> 2010.0
they don't want to destabilize it

2007.679 --> 2013.64
you have no idea what you're talking

2010.0 --> 2013.64
about bolly cats

2020.88 --> 2023.88
so

2037.519 --> 2040.519
hey

2056.159 --> 2062.0
how do you stabilize a civilized country

2059.28 --> 2065.9190000000003
by invading it and forcing people who do

2062.0 --> 2068.8
not want to be invaded to flee

2065.919 --> 2072.879
how do you do that

2068.8 --> 2072.8790000000004
well you just need enough people

2073.679 --> 2078.96
to actually want it in a way it's kind

2076.639 --> 2081.9190000000003
of democratic isn't that ironic right

2078.96 --> 2085.28
there's a democratic element to invasion

2081.919 --> 2088.7999999999997
right if the majority

2085.28 --> 2092.159
is okay with it and are willing to live

2088.8 --> 2094.639
in a future based on such a prospect

2092.159 --> 2096.96
then it'll work it'll stabilize right is

2094.639 --> 2101.04
it like can we miss these

2096.96 --> 2101.04
opponents these are the opposition

2101.28 --> 2104.96
can we live without that

2102.96 --> 2106.079
yeah okay

2104.96 --> 2108.4
go

2106.079 --> 2108.4
do it

2108.48 --> 2112.88
i have to work a little harder for the

2110.16 --> 2115.04
restorations afterward or something but

2112.88 --> 2117.839
yeah that's fine right at least we won't

2115.04 --> 2119.92
have those people here anymore

2117.839 --> 2122.48
that's how you do it it's actually kind

2119.92 --> 2122.48
of simple

2129.52 --> 2135.04
they're signing up to fight injured what

2132.0 --> 2137.839
are you blabbering about

2135.04 --> 2137.839
where's your proof

2138.64 --> 2144.0789999999997
i mean the invasion's happening right

2140.64 --> 2146.48
where's the death count

2144.079 --> 2148.0
right signing up huge numbers oh really

2146.48 --> 2150.0
so they're just gonna march a bunch of

2148.0 --> 2151.68
troops so that means that they're the

2150.0 --> 2153.119
more troops

2151.68 --> 2156.0789999999997
in a war

2153.119 --> 2157.6800000000003
that means the more killed right so

2156.079 --> 2159.92
really

2157.68 --> 2161.839
where the tens of thousands of dead

2159.92 --> 2164.16
people

2161.839 --> 2167.52
you literally don't know what the [ __ ]

2164.16 --> 2171.72
you're talking about bolly cats

2167.52 --> 2171.72
you're spouting propaganda

2182.48 --> 2187.119
yeah dude i'm gonna give you a timeout

2184.8 --> 2189.92
if you don't stop squirting it's getting

2187.119 --> 2189.92
really annoying

2190.64 --> 2195.44
i think this [ __ ]

2192.56 --> 2198.48
has run its course here

2195.44 --> 2203.2000000000003
who said that yeah that's what happens

2198.48 --> 2205.119
when a lot of people sign up yeah

2203.2 --> 2207.2
unless they didn't actually do that and

2205.119 --> 2208.96
it was just a bluff it was just a

2207.2 --> 2210.96
showcase

2208.96 --> 2215.32
a demonstration

2210.96 --> 2215.32
to sort of not lose face

2215.359 --> 2219.44
you have no idea how this world works

2218.079 --> 2222.1600000000003
body cats you

2219.44 --> 2224.0
literally don't know

2222.16 --> 2227.1189999999997
seem to have like the

2224.0 --> 2229.04
inside of it of a 12 year old although i

2227.119 --> 2231.44
think that a lot of 12 year olds these

2229.04 --> 2234.44
days are probably a lot wiser than you

2231.44 --> 2234.44
are

2248.48 --> 2251.599
yeah it's like where he is

2252.72 --> 2258.56
yeah okay it's time to go bye

2255.76 --> 2260.48
my [ __ ] go panic and spiral like a

2258.56 --> 2263.52
[ __ ] somewhere else

2260.48 --> 2265.28
go squirt in your in your fear porn

2263.52 --> 2267.599
forums or whatever

2265.28 --> 2269.76
go fantasize about how the world's gonna

2267.599 --> 2273.2000000000003
end because everybody's gonna get nuked

2269.76 --> 2277.32
to death and blah blah dude

2273.2 --> 2277.3199999999997
i don't have time for this [ __ ]

2289.28 --> 2296.28
right

2291.44 --> 2296.28
so that was that hey adam price

2309.68 --> 2312.56
well i've known him for quite a while

2311.44 --> 2316.16
actually

2312.56 --> 2316.16
he is kind of like that

2322.4 --> 2328.8
this is not like the first like

2324.88 --> 2330.0
gamma spiraling cycle i've seen from him

2328.8 --> 2332.4
when he gets like that it's just

2330.0 --> 2334.64
intentional it just never stops just you

2332.4 --> 2339.04
gotta kick him because it's just yeah it

2334.64 --> 2343.359
is just non-stop squirting

2339.04 --> 2345.44
right he's basically effectively a

2343.359 --> 2347.119
psycho engineered

2345.44 --> 2350.079
pawn

2347.119 --> 2351.2000000000003
part of the weapon of mass destruction

2350.079 --> 2354.2400000000002
right

2351.2 --> 2356.48
he plant the sea the panic and the lies

2354.24 --> 2358.0
and the suggestions of how terrible it

2356.48 --> 2360.88
could be through

2358.0 --> 2363.52
mass media

2360.88 --> 2367.599
right speaking points

2363.52 --> 2369.44
agreed upon lies to roll out and then

2367.599 --> 2371.119
the people

2369.44 --> 2373.839
accept that

2371.119 --> 2377.44
they lock themselves in psychologically

2373.839 --> 2377.44
and then they spread the panic

2380.32 --> 2386.56
that's how it works that's weapons of

2383.119 --> 2389.04
mass distraction the the eventual like

2386.56 --> 2390.48
the actual damage explosion are the

2389.04 --> 2391.92
people

2390.48 --> 2396.28
that bought it

2391.92 --> 2396.28
they're the ones that do the most damage

2397.44 --> 2401.68
they're the ones that cause a ruckus

2399.28 --> 2404.8
that are gonna hype up

2401.68 --> 2406.56
get everybody all angry and [ __ ] right

2404.8 --> 2408.4
that's how it works

2406.56 --> 2411.4
that's how weapons of mass distraction

2408.4 --> 2411.4
work

2465.44 --> 2468.4
once you understand they lie about the

2467.04 --> 2470.24
curve

2468.4 --> 2474.1600000000003
their fear point is no longer effective

2470.24 --> 2474.16
that not entirely true rig back

2474.319 --> 2479.04
but it will

2475.92 --> 2482.0
give you a little bit of an edge like

2479.04 --> 2484.4
you you will know like yeah everybody

2482.0 --> 2486.24
like it's rife with lies so doesn't

2484.4 --> 2489.76
always mean that you will automatically

2486.24 --> 2489.7599999999998
pick up on whatever lies

2490.48 --> 2494.92
but it'll help a little at least

2519.359 --> 2523.839
and what madam price what

2527.28 --> 2530.8390000000004
that would be weird

2549.68 --> 2552.72
ah

2550.48 --> 2554.16
yeah it's good to get a breather

2552.72 --> 2558.16
breather

2554.16 --> 2558.16
after squirting funny like that

2559.839 --> 2563.04
because you know we was just gonna do

2561.599 --> 2565.3590000000004
more of that right

2563.04 --> 2567.2
just gonna keep on going so

2565.359 --> 2568.24
it's enough

2567.2 --> 2570.319
i think

2568.24 --> 2573.359
we discussed everything that's really

2570.319 --> 2573.359
relevant about it

2576.48 --> 2579.839
hey slow mo moon buggy

2582.16 --> 2588.319
right i watched the movie yesterday

2585.44 --> 2588.319
it was pretty cool

2589.68 --> 2593.9199999999996
uh

2591.599 --> 2597.2000000000003
free guy

2593.92 --> 2600.0
had had heard some good things about it

2597.2 --> 2602.56
and even um benjamin was

2600.0 --> 2604.4
comp he had a compliment about it when

2602.56 --> 2606.72
he watched it the first time some time

2604.4 --> 2610.96
ago and i've seen some reviews but just

2606.72 --> 2610.9599999999996
never really got to it i watched it

2611.04 --> 2617.68
and yeah was actually kind of nice

2614.72 --> 2617.68
it was interesting

2619.119 --> 2626.52
is university freedom no it isn't

2622.4 --> 2626.52
hello professor phil bell

2635.92 --> 2641.76
right well borders boy

2638.4 --> 2645.76
let me give you an even more important

2641.76 --> 2645.76
detail on how to know

2646.079 --> 2650.5600000000004
the best way to discern the truth is not

2648.4 --> 2652.4
just to follow

2650.56 --> 2655.119
all that

2652.4 --> 2656.0
but to follow people that are really

2655.119 --> 2658.48
that

2656.0 --> 2662.599
are not sure that are trying to find out

2658.48 --> 2662.599
and are sharing that with you

2664.56 --> 2669.359
and that you can that are just where in

2666.8 --> 2671.44
which you can see as they're basically

2669.359 --> 2673.2
life crunching it for themselves kind of

2671.44 --> 2675.599
like what i'm doing

2673.2 --> 2678.0789999999997
already yeah had been thinking about it

2675.599 --> 2679.76
for a while

2678.079 --> 2680.5600000000004
because

2679.76 --> 2682.88
if

2680.56 --> 2686.0
somebody just has a very roll out

2682.88 --> 2688.88
opinion and they always know where to go

2686.0 --> 2692.16
it could be another propaganda speaking

2688.88 --> 2694.1600000000003
point that was decided upon

2692.16 --> 2696.16
so somebody like in the field that

2694.16 --> 2698.16
doesn't exactly know what what's going

2696.16 --> 2701.5989999999997
on they're just going to give you their

2698.16 --> 2704.72
raw in the moment analysis of things

2701.599 --> 2706.88
which is the best data it is the

2704.72 --> 2708.64
unrefined data

2706.88 --> 2711.6800000000003
through people that are

2708.64 --> 2715.2
in the moment attempting honest inquiry

2711.68 --> 2718.8799999999997
that actually deliver the best

2715.2 --> 2720.3999999999996
spiritual including data where you just

2718.88 --> 2722.56
get to really figure out what's

2720.4 --> 2724.8
happening and also then how the

2722.56 --> 2726.56
illusions fit on top of that like where

2724.8 --> 2728.8
the

2726.56 --> 2731.7999999999997
what's being lied about because of that

2728.8 --> 2731.8
right

2737.2 --> 2742.7999999999997
yeah flatter sage no it was it was kind

2739.28 --> 2747.6400000000003
of cute yeah it was really nice movie

2742.8 --> 2747.6400000000003
like it's worth watching again sometime

2750.4 --> 2756.1600000000003
by the way the the main

2752.64 --> 2758.839
villain guy the the trendy company owner

2756.16 --> 2761.52
was like so over the top

2758.839 --> 2763.839
hilarious so over the top such a

2761.52 --> 2765.28
cartoonish

2763.839 --> 2768.24
figure

2765.28 --> 2770.4
but it was kind of amazing

2768.24 --> 2772.72
like embodiment of what's wrong with

2770.4 --> 2776.1600000000003
corporate

2772.72 --> 2777.7599999999998
gamer like game corporate

2776.16 --> 2780.24
people

2777.76 --> 2780.2400000000002
brilliant

2780.8 --> 2786.8
so yeah i think that the guys that made

2783.52 --> 2788.4
that movie definitely were about gaming

2786.8 --> 2791.599
like they they

2788.4 --> 2791.599
they did some research

2792.319 --> 2797.119
they know programmers and

2795.04 --> 2799.2799999999997
and game companies and how that works

2797.119 --> 2802.839
they did actual study

2799.28 --> 2802.8390000000004
it was pretty cool

2804.319 --> 2808.8
get people on low income get a

2806.16 --> 2809.7599999999998
university education

2808.8 --> 2813.8390000000004
no

2809.76 --> 2816.4
unless they get like a special boy grant

2813.839 --> 2818.56
basically if somebody gives it to them

2816.4 --> 2822.319
because they're like super good or super

2818.56 --> 2822.319
connected you know how that goes

2824.56 --> 2831.44
my brother did actually go to university

2826.96 --> 2833.599
but he also paid for that

2831.44 --> 2835.68
partially i think that if you're really

2833.599 --> 2839.44
young

2835.68 --> 2839.44
and you score really high that

2839.839 --> 2845.359
yeah but eventually like ah

2842.8 --> 2848.1600000000003
it's never just free

2845.359 --> 2848.16
and it shouldn't be

2851.119 --> 2856.0
because then you just end up with like

2853.839 --> 2858.4
like anything that's just purely free is

2856.0 --> 2860.64
going to end up rife

2858.4 --> 2864.44
with propaganda

2860.64 --> 2864.44
trying to make you deranged

2893.04 --> 2895.2
all right

2894.24 --> 2897.52
i mean

2895.2 --> 2899.68
technically

2897.52 --> 2902.079
the better and more dedicated any

2899.68 --> 2904.319
teachers are in any school

2902.079 --> 2907.3590000000004
the more money it's going to cost and if

2904.319 --> 2909.04
they get their money elsewhere

2907.359 --> 2910.24
that means that they're

2909.04 --> 2912.079
not

2910.24 --> 2913.68
that they have mixed priorities

2912.079 --> 2916.4
effectively

2913.68 --> 2919.2
right if the students are the ones

2916.4 --> 2921.28
actually paying their salaries

2919.2 --> 2923.5989999999997
then they will be more loyal to the

2921.28 --> 2926.1600000000003
students naturally because they're like

2923.599 --> 2929.839
financially dependent

2926.16 --> 2929.839
it just works better

2930.8 --> 2935.119
right if there's some free university

2933.119 --> 2936.96
then like why would the teachers

2935.119 --> 2939.119
technically they wouldn't have to give a

2936.96 --> 2941.44
[ __ ] about the students

2939.119 --> 2943.28
i mean they could if they wanted to but

2941.44 --> 2946.0
there's no

2943.28 --> 2952.44
like no binding contract to actually

2946.0 --> 2952.44
reinforce that will that impulse you see

2961.44 --> 2964.88
oh my god

2962.64 --> 2968.359
said squirty boy again

2964.88 --> 2968.359
get out of here

2973.2 --> 2978.24
yeah it doesn't work i know what you're

2975.599 --> 2978.2400000000002
trying to do

2980.079 --> 2984.88
creepy

2982.319 --> 2987.7599999999998
i think that i think the guy's just cia

2984.88 --> 2990.8
or something he's he's literally just

2987.76 --> 2990.8
attempting to

2990.88 --> 2997.52
really put an effort in to

2993.319 --> 3000.24
psychologically create crevices

2997.52 --> 3000.24
the scatter

3000.319 --> 3005.04
so whoever that guy is that including

3002.64 --> 3007.68
like tries to call me on my phone i

3005.04 --> 3009.839
think that he is actually a paid agent

3007.68 --> 3012.16
of disruption

3009.839 --> 3014.72
that's not just somebody that does that

3012.16 --> 3016.72
on because he doesn't like me now he's

3014.72 --> 3018.7999999999997
actually paid

3016.72 --> 3021.5989999999997
to disrupt me somehow and he's doing

3018.8 --> 3024.079
that he's attempting that constantly

3021.599 --> 3026.6400000000003
periodically it's like oh

3024.079 --> 3030.559
we have to disrupt are we now send the

3026.64 --> 3030.5589999999997
guy in again to nag him

3033.2 --> 3036.72
i highly doubt this is yeah you don't

3035.119 --> 3037.76
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

3036.72 --> 3039.68
dude

3037.76 --> 3042.079
you don't know where they go and what

3039.68 --> 3042.0789999999997
they do

3042.559 --> 3047.44
cia is always studying people

3052.96 --> 3059.599
now you doubt paid agents or come here

3055.119 --> 3059.599
too oh well maybe you're one of them

3065.68 --> 3070.72
do you know

3067.119 --> 3072.319
well i have a good sense about it yeah

3070.72 --> 3075.1189999999997
i've suspected

3072.319 --> 3077.7599999999998
that there's agencies

3075.119 --> 3079.44
having an interest in to like

3077.76 --> 3081.5200000000004
[ __ ] around with me

3079.44 --> 3084.0
push me around

3081.52 --> 3086.48
because i'm kind of presenting myself as

3084.0 --> 3089.44
really open and so they almost like have

3086.48 --> 3089.44
to do it and

3089.68 --> 3094.16
like it's not like money is an issue to

3092.16 --> 3096.96
them

3094.16 --> 3098.5589999999997
like i almost welcome it i almost

3096.96 --> 3100.88
welcome it like why don't you try why

3098.559 --> 3101.8390000000004
don't you try to influence me

3100.88 --> 3106.079
yeah

3101.839 --> 3108.0
i will literally dig inside of your head

3106.079 --> 3111.28
and figure out things that you thought

3108.0 --> 3112.64
you could hide from me

3111.28 --> 3115.28
yeah

3112.64 --> 3118.72
effectively telepathic when

3115.28 --> 3118.7200000000003
when i actually want to

3119.68 --> 3124.48
so yeah oh oh this that no i'm

3122.48 --> 3126.64
definitely going to say that that guy is

3124.48 --> 3128.559
not just doing that because he's bored

3126.64 --> 3130.16
or he just doesn't like me i'm pretty

3128.559 --> 3132.8
sure that

3130.16 --> 3134.24
he's a guy that periodically

3132.8 --> 3135.92
is set

3134.24 --> 3139.16
to harass me

3135.92 --> 3139.16
very specifically

3149.599 --> 3155.3590000000004
suspected but not proof yeah yeah i

3152.16 --> 3157.52
don't need that yeah i work through

3155.359 --> 3160.0789999999997
energy

3157.52 --> 3162.16
i'm not here to provide scientific proof

3160.079 --> 3164.319
for every [ __ ] thing

3162.16 --> 3166.0
just because you want that as a standard

3164.319 --> 3167.52
even though you don't personally uphold

3166.0 --> 3170.0
that as a standard

3167.52 --> 3172.24
you actually go by consensus [ __ ] if

3170.0 --> 3174.96
somebody just claims it and it's

3172.24 --> 3178.0
approved oh is allowed to claim that

3174.96 --> 3181.04
[ __ ] then it's good to you yeah well

3178.0 --> 3183.04
i don't go by that standard i go by my

3181.04 --> 3185.839
own standard

3183.04 --> 3187.2
that standard is figuring it out

3185.839 --> 3189.68
and not

3187.2 --> 3193.04
not being dissuaded

3189.68 --> 3194.5589999999997
if i came up with it naturally

3193.04 --> 3196.0
it's not through somebody else's

3194.559 --> 3198.8
suggestion

3196.0 --> 3201.04
then i tend to rely upon that

3198.8 --> 3204.079
idea that came into me because all

3201.04 --> 3206.0
information comes from god

3204.079 --> 3208.4
right and i'd like to have my

3206.0 --> 3211.92
information from god and not through

3208.4 --> 3214.559
somebody else rose color darkly

3211.92 --> 3216.319
with their intentions

3214.559 --> 3217.8390000000004
put on top of that to attempt to

3216.319 --> 3221.119
manipulate me

3217.839 --> 3223.44
so i trust my insights

3221.119 --> 3225.839
right even if i don't have any proofread

3223.44 --> 3228.559
because i don't give a [ __ ]

3225.839 --> 3230.48
that you are demanding that in chat you

3228.559 --> 3233.119
see

3230.48 --> 3236.079
if i feel something out i'll say it

3233.119 --> 3238.96
and i will be prepared to back it up

3236.079 --> 3242.079
because i am aware of just how saying

3238.96 --> 3245.2
things has an influence on people

3242.079 --> 3245.2000000000003
throughout time

3246.0 --> 3251.8
yeah

3247.119 --> 3251.8
it's called actual control

3260.559 --> 3264.8
right and if you don't want to believe

3262.72 --> 3266.48
me then don't

3264.8 --> 3268.48
good

3266.48 --> 3270.2400000000002
let's move on to the next subject and

3268.48 --> 3271.76
we'll see over time

3270.24 --> 3273.68
who was right

3271.76 --> 3275.92
that's how it always works that's even

3273.68 --> 3275.9199999999996
how

3276.0 --> 3279.92
basic

3277.76 --> 3282.559
data gathering works

3279.92 --> 3285.119
or experimentation you figure it out

3282.559 --> 3286.7200000000003
over time right it starts with an idea

3285.119 --> 3288.6400000000003
then you test that idea how are you

3286.72 --> 3291.68
going to test it well sometimes you just

3288.64 --> 3294.319
have to wait a while for things to

3291.68 --> 3296.799
transform on their own yeah it's not

3294.319 --> 3299.04
scientific because you're not actually

3296.799 --> 3301.2
very manipulating anything

3299.04 --> 3303.7599999999998
but it is a

3301.2 --> 3303.7599999999998
what is

3304.88 --> 3311.76
it is a what is inquiry

3308.16 --> 3311.7599999999998
and that works with psychology

3311.839 --> 3315.92
and it works with the intuition

3318.88 --> 3321.839
ah

3336.799 --> 3341.28
why would he be interested well why are

3338.64 --> 3343.52
you interested why are you here rocket

3341.28 --> 3343.52
man

3344.799 --> 3348.48
right

3346.64 --> 3351.04
why didn't you just start answering your

3348.48 --> 3354.799
own questions you just ask these stupid

3351.04 --> 3357.119
questions like an ignorant hmong

3354.799 --> 3359.359
instead of just like hey well why am i

3357.119 --> 3359.359
here

3361.119 --> 3368.119
because you enjoy my content why

3363.92 --> 3368.119
why do you enjoy my content

3377.599 --> 3382.799
do you enjoy art like impressionists

3381.119 --> 3384.559
so there's something you could get out

3382.799 --> 3387.44
of it right

3384.559 --> 3389.8390000000004
well maybe

3387.44 --> 3392.88
if there's something that you as just a

3389.839 --> 3396.0789999999997
general person can get out of me

3392.88 --> 3399.6800000000003
then maybe that has the interest right

3396.079 --> 3403.2000000000003
of an agency that's what do they do

3399.68 --> 3405.52
spread lies influence people so if i am

3403.2 --> 3409.4399999999996
effectively influencing somebody that's

3405.52 --> 3411.68
even on a philosophical arch enemy list

3409.44 --> 3413.52
officially this is what ball is supposed

3411.68 --> 3415.9199999999996
to be

3413.52 --> 3417.839
and you're still here in my chat and

3415.92 --> 3419.359
generally communicating all right well

3417.839 --> 3421.2
maybe that's going to pique their

3419.359 --> 3424.4
interest have you ever thought about

3421.2 --> 3426.319
that no no you haven't didn't you

3424.4 --> 3428.7200000000003
you're too concerned trying to prove how

3426.319 --> 3431.72
i'm wrong because you couldn't handle

3428.72 --> 3431.72
something

3437.839 --> 3444.4
no bar this boy is not rocket man rocket

3440.4 --> 3444.4
man is not the other baldy cats guy

3444.88 --> 3448.88
they've been both in chat simultaneously

3453.839 --> 3458.5589999999997
but i have thought about rocketman as

3455.839 --> 3461.839
being potentially

3458.559 --> 3461.8390000000004
agent adjacent

3465.28 --> 3470.559
certainly not a guy that i

3467.119 --> 3470.559
straightforward trust

3472.079 --> 3475.6800000000003
now it's up to me to figure out whether

3473.839 --> 3477.7599999999998
that is because he is just very

3475.68 --> 3480.319
programmed

3477.76 --> 3483.5200000000004
or whether he actually is here with a

3480.319 --> 3483.52
mission to influence

3485.68 --> 3489.7599999999998
right

3486.88 --> 3493.559
but yeah we'll see over time

3489.76 --> 3493.559
as we always do

3504.079 --> 3508.079
right well there you go you've answered

3506.16 --> 3510.64
your question why would an agency be

3508.079 --> 3510.6400000000003
interested

3514.88 --> 3519.2000000000003
because of my ability to express views

3521.119 --> 3526.2400000000002
isn't that something that they would be

3523.599 --> 3529.3590000000004
interested in since they are the ones

3526.24 --> 3533.2
constantly trying to construct

3529.359 --> 3533.2
machinations and distractions

3534.48 --> 3539.68
now what better to enforce a good

3536.72 --> 3540.3999999999996
distraction by being to able to explain

3539.68 --> 3543.7599999999998
it

3540.4 --> 3543.76
in a high quality way

3545.359 --> 3550.799
there you go

3546.48 --> 3550.799
studying me could potentially help them

3551.52 --> 3557.28
refine their own propaganda

3553.76 --> 3560.48
there's nothing really i can do about it

3557.28 --> 3563.52
except trusting god

3560.48 --> 3568.319
right because there is that effect

3563.52 --> 3569.7599999999998
if you utilize refined skills like this

3568.319 --> 3572.88
for

3569.76 --> 3575.2000000000003
earthly gains or power

3572.88 --> 3578.4
then that has consequences which will

3575.2 --> 3581.4399999999996
automatically pollute the quality of the

3578.4 --> 3585.119
trait right which is why i don't do that

3581.44 --> 3587.04
so i can keep the quality of that trait

3585.119 --> 3589.2000000000003
right so i'm trusting that even though

3587.04 --> 3591.2799999999997
i'm sharing high quality

3589.2 --> 3593.2
communication skill in a way that people

3591.28 --> 3596.079
could potentially copy that if it were

3593.2 --> 3598.64
to be abused that the quality of what

3596.079 --> 3600.799
i'm doing will automatically dissipate

3598.64 --> 3603.1189999999997
and that is the the thing the mechanism

3600.799 --> 3605.04
that i trust

3603.119 --> 3608.88
in order to be able to do this without

3605.04 --> 3608.88
destroying the world potentially

3609.92 --> 3614.119
that's the mechanism i trust

3619.28 --> 3624.96
because i'm all about honesty and if you

3623.44 --> 3629.52
are not

3624.96 --> 3631.839
then what i do doesn't work as well

3629.52 --> 3633.7599999999998
it will dissipate

3631.839 --> 3637.04
it will scatter up

3633.76 --> 3639.0400000000004
become it will unravel in its cohesion

3637.04 --> 3640.96
as soon as you attempt to explain

3639.04 --> 3644.64
anything and find the tail

3640.96 --> 3644.64
but actually use it to lie

3644.72 --> 3651.04
then it the power of that will dissipate

3647.92 --> 3651.04
that's what i'm trusting

3651.68 --> 3654.9199999999996
that effect

3662.72 --> 3667.64
you like chatting that's good for you

3664.64 --> 3667.64
trillian

3678.799 --> 3685.599
challenge you everything we're told in

3681.28 --> 3687.599
the same way you challenge what

3685.599 --> 3691.28
you challenge

3687.599 --> 3691.28
me and my members in chat

3691.44 --> 3695.839
the way

3693.52 --> 3698.559
we challenge mates excuse me am i

3695.839 --> 3701.2
challenging mainstream media am i

3698.559 --> 3703.8390000000004
actually saying or repeating anything

3701.2 --> 3705.52
that they say

3703.839 --> 3707.68
no i'm just

3705.52 --> 3708.799
pointing at the motivation the back

3707.68 --> 3710.96
lying

3708.799 --> 3712.96
mechanism

3710.96 --> 3716.079
what's going on i'm not addressing their

3712.96 --> 3718.319
propaganda at all

3716.079 --> 3720.48
i'm just trying to describe what it is

3718.319 --> 3722.5589999999997
that's happening

3720.48 --> 3724.319
in which it is a part of that but i'm

3722.559 --> 3726.2400000000002
not actually addressing their lies that

3724.319 --> 3728.48
would be a complete waste of time every

3726.24 --> 3730.24
time

3728.48 --> 3732.48
right so that's not what you're actually

3730.24 --> 3735.2
doing

3732.48 --> 3738.48
because you are actually addressing or

3735.2 --> 3740.0
trying to address everything i say

3738.48 --> 3742.96
which is not what i'm doing with

3740.0 --> 3742.96
mainstream media

3743.76 --> 3748.2400000000002
so you're already technically incorrect

3746.0 --> 3748.24
there

3748.48 --> 3752.839
fe is a direct challenge to mainstream

3751.2 --> 3756.64
no no it's

3752.839 --> 3758.48
not it's just a philosophical

3756.64 --> 3760.64
struggle

3758.48 --> 3763.599
that's all

3760.64 --> 3766.24
it's about the worldview

3763.599 --> 3768.6400000000003
and the nature of physical reality the

3766.24 --> 3769.52
background to whatever is happening

3768.64 --> 3772.0
right

3769.52 --> 3774.72
mainstream

3772.0 --> 3776.559
like people in mainstream media they

3774.72 --> 3781.0789999999997
mostly just

3776.559 --> 3781.079
they're not addressing any of that

3783.359 --> 3787.0
they rarely do

3798.64 --> 3806.5589999999997
fb challenges everybody

3802.0 --> 3806.559
what we think we know right

3807.76 --> 3813.28
you're exercising your right to question

3809.839 --> 3816.64
you know fine wow

3813.28 --> 3816.6400000000003
so politically correct

3821.039 --> 3825.0
hey light before the tunnel

3840.88 --> 3843.119
what

3843.2 --> 3849.68
the fourth state of matter what

3847.68 --> 3850.8799999999997
but that's incorrect that can't be

3849.68 --> 3853.839
because there is a fourth state of

3850.88 --> 3853.839
matter it's called plasma

3854.88 --> 3858.0
what

3856.559 --> 3861.88
why are you getting this slo-mo moon

3858.0 --> 3861.88
buggy that's really weird

3877.76 --> 3881.6800000000003
yeah sure my slow mo buggy yeah do that

3880.319 --> 3885.72
send that link

3881.68 --> 3885.72
i'll be right back at two minutes

3954.24 --> 3957.24
so

3976.4 --> 3979.4
hmm

3980.64 --> 3982.8799999999997
ah

3985.039 --> 3988.88
okay adam price yeah i have a good power

3987.039 --> 3990.96
nap

3988.88 --> 3993.839
let me check that link there slow mo

3990.96 --> 3993.839
moon buggy

4002.079 --> 4007.039
that could be okay this is a purely

4004.559 --> 4008.559
hypothetical article

4007.039 --> 4012.1600000000003
literally the first sentence the

4008.559 --> 4014.799
structure of earth's core could be

4012.16 --> 4018.5589999999997
unlike this

4014.799 --> 4020.799
this is like a ballwin story

4018.559 --> 4023.119
first sentence could be yeah that means

4020.799 --> 4026.0
it's not actually real

4023.119 --> 4030.76
this is just the hypothetical

4026.0 --> 4030.76
link but funny though thanks for that

4046.839 --> 4052.96
yeah the internet is monitored yeah but

4050.319 --> 4056.0
this is not about monitoring rocket man

4052.96 --> 4059.839
i didn't say that there's agents in

4056.0 --> 4061.76
chats to monitor people

4059.839 --> 4064.799
nobody said that

4061.76 --> 4064.7990000000004
i didn't say that

4065.76 --> 4069.3590000000004
yeah

4067.359 --> 4072.48
influencers

4069.359 --> 4076.5989999999997
not to keep track but to influence

4072.48 --> 4076.599
that's a very different function

4089.359 --> 4093.5989999999997
yeah well rocket man i didn't

4096.96 --> 4101.4800000000005
hey geoshifter good to see you

4106.859 --> 4110.069
[Music]

4114.0 --> 4117.0
hmm

4124.159 --> 4129.4
ah man

4126.4 --> 4129.4
fluff

4176.719 --> 4179.719
hmm

4192.88 --> 4197.84
really did they say that kevlar

4195.28 --> 4202.159
that's hilarious but yeah for me like

4197.84 --> 4203.360000000001
the the article completely

4202.159 --> 4205.599999999999
was just

4203.36 --> 4207.759999999999
immediately dismissible by how the first

4205.6 --> 4209.280000000001
sentence started

4207.76 --> 4210.320000000001
it's a could be

4209.28 --> 4214.5599999999995
article

4210.32 --> 4214.5599999999995
so it wasn't actually even making a

4214.84 --> 4220.76
claim it's just theoretical squirting

4233.36 --> 4238.5599999999995
i mean by the same type of approach of

4236.239 --> 4241.239
reasoning like that

4238.56 --> 4245.52
you could be like oh i'm gonna oh

4241.239 --> 4248.799999999999
revolutionary new astrophysicist idea

4245.52 --> 4253.84
what if all planetary bodies actually

4248.8 --> 4255.52
have a small black hole inside of them

4253.84 --> 4257.52
right

4255.52 --> 4260.400000000001
that is the thing that pulls it all

4257.52 --> 4261.6
there and it then just locks in and then

4260.4 --> 4266.4
yeah

4261.6 --> 4266.400000000001
planet forms either collapses or

4266.8 --> 4272.08
it just sticks around the black hole and

4269.199 --> 4273.599999999999
that's like why the sun is all black on

4272.08 --> 4275.76
the inside right

4273.6 --> 4275.76
like

4276.56 --> 4280.080000000001
it's really not that difficult to just

4279.04 --> 4283.76
start

4280.08 --> 4286.48
sci-fi science fiction fantasizing about

4283.76 --> 4289.679
what could be in this theoretical ball

4286.48 --> 4290.799999999999
in the theoretical outer space universe

4289.679 --> 4292.2390000000005
right

4290.8 --> 4294.8
it's not that difficult to make

4292.239 --> 4294.799999999999
something up

4296.159 --> 4300.4
right i literally just said it like yeah

4297.84 --> 4302.400000000001
what if all planets and moons all with

4300.4 --> 4303.759999999999
what if all spherical bodies are

4302.4 --> 4305.44
actually

4303.76 --> 4309.4400000000005
counteracted

4305.44 --> 4312.5599999999995
by a miniature black hole that like

4309.44 --> 4314.719
exactly opposes their mass

4312.56 --> 4317.280000000001
and that could be the thing that

4314.719 --> 4319.28
actually keeps a planet to the size they

4317.28 --> 4321.5199999999995
are without just dispersing blah blah

4319.28 --> 4323.679
blah and then ooh space-time bending

4321.52 --> 4325.360000000001
that would explain how

4323.679 --> 4327.76
this is so weird because this is even

4325.36 --> 4329.679
like a ballwin theory from long time ago

4327.76 --> 4332.2390000000005
that i reason out

4329.679 --> 4335.679
with einstein gravity it's like

4332.239 --> 4338.4
no it's just holes in space

4335.679 --> 4340.4
planets are not just mass attracting

4338.4 --> 4342.879999999999
mass bodies and that's how they then

4340.4 --> 4344.799999999999
form and just randomly gets together

4342.88 --> 4348.08
forms balls no

4344.8 --> 4350.4800000000005
they're literally like holes in space in

4348.08 --> 4352.5599999999995
which all matter gather

4350.48 --> 4354.839999999999
everywhere in these holes in space that

4352.56 --> 4356.719
have this perfectly

4354.84 --> 4358.32
cyclical

4356.719 --> 4360.0
distribution

4358.32 --> 4362.48
in the galactic

4360.0 --> 4362.48
system

4363.679 --> 4367.84
and that's

4365.28 --> 4369.92
why those planets and moons and all that

4367.84 --> 4372.2390000000005
that's why they have formed into a

4369.92 --> 4374.64
planet because they basically were a

4372.239 --> 4376.5599999999995
hole in space which filled up with

4374.64 --> 4378.320000000001
matter because that's the thing that

4376.56 --> 4380.64
actually attracts the matter not the

4378.32 --> 4380.639999999999
mass

4381.12 --> 4386.4
right and well if i then

4383.76 --> 4389.1990000000005
continuate that train of thinking then

4386.4 --> 4392.48
yeah having miniature black holes inside

4389.199 --> 4393.759999999999
of every planet makes perfect sense

4392.48 --> 4396.639999999999
because

4393.76 --> 4399.92
that's what would have formed the planet

4396.64 --> 4401.84
in the first place huh huh there you go

4399.92 --> 4404.4800000000005
see

4401.84 --> 4407.4400000000005
it's really easy well it's easy for me

4404.48 --> 4410.48
because i'm kind of like yeah i have a

4407.44 --> 4413.28
ball win inside of me

4410.48 --> 4415.28
see

4413.28 --> 4417.84
it seems like that's what the person in

4415.28 --> 4420.88
the article was doing

4417.84 --> 4423.360000000001
it's just pure theoretics in a moment

4420.88 --> 4425.52
you like that idea i bet you do

4423.36 --> 4427.36
i have a lot of solutions

4425.52 --> 4430.96
i've a lot of solutions for nepal

4427.36 --> 4433.199
religion right i've basically said yeah

4430.96 --> 4434.64
i've given the room if the world is good

4433.199 --> 4437.28
enough

4434.64 --> 4439.679
i could keep the myth going forever the

4437.28 --> 4442.4
rest of my life

4439.679 --> 4445.52
but will i want to will the people that

4442.4 --> 4448.239
actually uphold the dream be worth it

4445.52 --> 4452.88
or will they all just become complete

4448.239 --> 4455.28
delusional demons and destroy themselves

4452.88 --> 4457.6
i don't want to be a an arbiter of doom

4455.28 --> 4459.599999999999
like that

4457.6 --> 4461.84
right

4459.6 --> 4463.679
the duo cosmogonical society goes both

4461.84 --> 4465.92
ways

4463.679 --> 4468.61
the ballers have to be good enough to

4465.92 --> 4471.04
actually

4468.61 --> 4472.32
[Music]

4471.04 --> 4473.5199999999995
earn

4472.32 --> 4475.04
the dream

4473.52 --> 4475.84
to continue

4475.04 --> 4477.679
right

4475.84 --> 4479.1990000000005
you don't just get the dream for free

4477.679 --> 4481.4400000000005
and then oh everything is going to be

4479.199 --> 4484.799999999999
all right no no no no

4481.44 --> 4484.799999999999
you have to work for the dream

4486.0 --> 4490.8
you have to be

4488.159 --> 4494.92
a good human being

4490.8 --> 4494.92
in order to deserve that

4497.36 --> 4500.36
ugh

4512.4 --> 4516.96
yeah but i bet you like that idea

4514.32 --> 4519.92
professor phil bell just know that it's

4516.96 --> 4524.199
my freaking idea i came up with that

4519.92 --> 4524.1990000000005
like 25 years ago

4525.76 --> 4530.96
upon my very very first encounter with

4529.04 --> 4532.4
the concept of einstein gravity

4530.96 --> 4536.679
immediately

4532.4 --> 4536.679
that was my conclusion instantly

4545.28 --> 4549.28
do your own research don't let arwens

4547.44 --> 4552.678999999999
what are you talking about

4549.28 --> 4552.679
rocket man

4561.76 --> 4565.4400000000005
like what do you mean don't let me see

4564.08 --> 4569.36
that what

4565.44 --> 4571.04
so i can ban you for being an ass

4569.36 --> 4573.679
what the hell are you talking about of

4571.04 --> 4576.56
course do your own research but you got

4573.679 --> 4578.4
to know your sources though

4576.56 --> 4579.120000000001
yeah do your own research it doesn't

4578.4 --> 4582.32
mean

4579.12 --> 4582.32
put on cnn

4582.56 --> 4587.92
right doing your own research doesn't

4584.56 --> 4590.159000000001
mean go on facebook to approved

4587.92 --> 4592.96
news forums

4590.159 --> 4595.199
do your own research is actually do your

4592.96 --> 4597.44
own research that means

4595.199 --> 4599.759999999999
like internally

4597.44 --> 4602.0
internally you do your own research you

4599.76 --> 4605.12
wean yourself off

4602.0 --> 4607.199
cookie cutter information providers that

4605.12 --> 4608.48
will deliver you everything like you're

4607.199 --> 4610.0
a baby

4608.48 --> 4613.04
and determined for you what you should

4610.0 --> 4616.159
know and don't and actually become a

4613.04 --> 4618.719
personal information collector that

4616.159 --> 4620.96
refines their own view that learns how

4618.719 --> 4623.6
to distinguish when somebody's giving an

4620.96 --> 4625.12
honest opinion or is sharing their

4623.6 --> 4628.159000000001
expertise

4625.12 --> 4631.36
and then you

4628.159 --> 4633.36
from scratch reconstruct everything over

4631.36 --> 4635.759999999999
and over and over and over again until

4633.36 --> 4638.239
it becomes so cohesive all the combined

4635.76 --> 4640.159000000001
information of everything you gathered

4638.239 --> 4642.08
that you just get a clear

4640.159 --> 4643.36
intuitive picture of what's actually

4642.08 --> 4644.48
going on

4643.36 --> 4646.639999999999
that's

4644.48 --> 4649.36
doing your own research it pretty much

4646.64 --> 4649.360000000001
requires

4649.76 --> 4652.88
lifetime dedication

4653.12 --> 4658.64
doing your own research is not just

4655.36 --> 4660.719
going to cookie cutter news providers

4658.64 --> 4664.360000000001
and then that's how it is that's not

4660.719 --> 4664.36
doing your own research

4672.719 --> 4678.64
not providing source well i'm sorry

4674.96 --> 4682.08
rocket man you're in a chat you can't

4678.64 --> 4685.12
expect people to just roll out

4682.08 --> 4687.44
sources within a debate like that right

4685.12 --> 4689.12
unless you're like officially agreeing

4687.44 --> 4691.199
we're gonna do a debate you're gonna

4689.12 --> 4694.239
have to have sources you can't just

4691.199 --> 4698.4
expect that from people in chat on an

4694.239 --> 4698.4
underrun conversation that's ridiculous

4699.36 --> 4704.639999999999
like even if he had the sources if he'd

4702.08 --> 4707.64
start providing that you wouldn't grab

4704.64 --> 4707.64
it

4708.8 --> 4713.679
it would

4710.56 --> 4713.679
become its own thing

4714.56 --> 4719.04
right if you really want

4716.4 --> 4719.04
that debate

4719.44 --> 4723.12
with borders boy

4721.04 --> 4724.88
then why don't you fire up a stream and

4723.12 --> 4726.159
you start debating that on your own

4724.88 --> 4729.8
stream and then

4726.159 --> 4729.799999999999
get in some sources

4736.0 --> 4740.88
you would reject all sources well at

4738.56 --> 4743.280000000001
least it would be you on camera

4740.88 --> 4745.76
providing your research

4743.28 --> 4746.96
it will give us all a better insight on

4745.76 --> 4748.96
where you are

4746.96 --> 4751.92
at mentally

4748.96 --> 4753.76
and how you your growth curve we could

4751.92 --> 4756.2390000000005
learn about that out of it and even if

4753.76 --> 4759.04
he ignore it all

4756.239 --> 4759.04
that wouldn't matter

4759.6 --> 4762.96
right and if you're just gonna throw

4761.36 --> 4765.04
yeah you wouldn't make that kind of

4762.96 --> 4767.679
effort just in some random chat with

4765.04 --> 4770.239
some guy you know you barely know

4767.679 --> 4773.76
i get that he's just being a whiner they

4770.239 --> 4773.759999999999
do this to me all the time

4774.4 --> 4777.12
like

4775.12 --> 4779.84
no i'm not gonna provide sources oh

4777.12 --> 4780.64
quotation please yeah i am the quotation

4779.84 --> 4782.8
yeah

4780.64 --> 4784.719
you can quote me in 10 years when it

4782.8 --> 4787.28
turns out i was right

4784.719 --> 4790.28
i am the quotation

4787.28 --> 4790.28
yeah

4790.4 --> 4797.239
my research is mostly spiritual

4793.6 --> 4797.2390000000005
it's very elusive

4805.52 --> 4808.56
okay service day

4810.88 --> 4814.88
really good nap

4812.48 --> 4817.28
god am i so boring i mean do i have to

4814.88 --> 4819.4400000000005
be a rage win to wake people up

4817.28 --> 4820.48
i mean i'm trying not to i'm trying to

4819.44 --> 4822.159
be

4820.48 --> 4825.36
well i don't even have to try just

4822.159 --> 4825.36
working naturally i'm just

4826.639 --> 4830.679
being

4827.679 --> 4830.679
stable

4834.719 --> 4841.04
wikileaks is a psyop well it's a

4838.56 --> 4843.52
an okay source for information but it's

4841.04 --> 4847.36
been widely corrupted like back like

4843.52 --> 4849.92
even 10 years ago or more

4847.36 --> 4853.04
it was blatantly obvious that there were

4849.92 --> 4855.92
people that had access to wiki

4853.04 --> 4858.48
waiting wikileaks no not wikileaks

4855.92 --> 4861.4400000000005
wikipedia i'm sorry i mixed it up

4858.48 --> 4864.5599999999995
wikipedia

4861.44 --> 4866.799999999999
that people would just like add provable

4864.56 --> 4869.1990000000005
information with sources and then like

4866.8 --> 4872.08
within half an hour somebody would move

4869.199 --> 4874.879999999999
in and delete it all

4872.08 --> 4876.719
right and that's a public information

4874.88 --> 4880.159000000001
thing

4876.719 --> 4882.2390000000005
that's been happening like over a decade

4880.159 --> 4885.12
like there's certain things you're not

4882.239 --> 4887.839999999999
allowed to share wikipedia will delete

4885.12 --> 4889.44
it very quickly and not even mention

4887.84 --> 4891.360000000001
that it happened not even like hey you

4889.44 --> 4893.599999999999
don't do that no it's just like oh that

4891.36 --> 4896.4
didn't exist

4893.6 --> 4896.400000000001
very quickly

4897.28 --> 4900.5599999999995
right and wikileaks

4900.88 --> 4903.84
is it a psyop

4904.32 --> 4908.5599999999995
yes and no

4906.159 --> 4911.5199999999995
it was a revealing and then

4908.56 --> 4914.52
forged into a psyop and a countersight

4911.52 --> 4914.52
up

4916.8 --> 4921.1990000000005
try and develop my ideas for what are

4918.96 --> 4923.28
you talking about professor filwell did

4921.199 --> 4925.12
i enchant you with my

4923.28 --> 4926.639
black holes at the center of every

4925.12 --> 4929.04
planet idea

4926.639 --> 4929.04
did i

4929.36 --> 4935.5199999999995
you don't seem to understand though that

4932.88 --> 4937.679
the whole developing part

4935.52 --> 4940.2390000000005
that's not what i do

4937.679 --> 4943.36
that's what like nerds that like to

4940.239 --> 4946.4
stare at fictional math do

4943.36 --> 4948.639
right you go develop it you go and

4946.4 --> 4950.719
calculate it how that's supposed to work

4948.639 --> 4953.4400000000005
i'm not going to do the math

4950.719 --> 4954.8
i'm just here to basically forge the

4953.44 --> 4956.32
ideas

4954.8 --> 4958.96
i'm not going to calculate i'm not going

4956.32 --> 4961.36
to model that i'll just

4958.96 --> 4964.36
lay out i'll just explain it

4961.36 --> 4964.36
done

4976.4 --> 4980.719
right but it does make sense there's

4978.32 --> 4982.799999999999
holes in space

4980.719 --> 4985.28
even dust would gather there then at

4982.8 --> 4987.28
first those holes would not be strong

4985.28 --> 4989.36
enough

4987.28 --> 4991.5199999999995
to like like they're not critical mass

4989.36 --> 4994.239
strong enough to actually create like a

4991.52 --> 4996.4800000000005
matter implosion like a black hole

4994.239 --> 4998.718999999999
so stuff would just gather

4996.48 --> 5002.239
and then as more and more gathers it

4998.719 --> 5003.199
starts to get more force it compacts and

5002.239 --> 5005.839999999999
then

5003.199 --> 5009.199
eventually micro black hole might form

5005.84 --> 5012.08
at the center and maybe even absorb

5009.199 --> 5012.08
some of the matter

5012.159 --> 5016.4
but it would all be so compacted that it

5014.239 --> 5017.678999999999
would just rest there it wouldn't like

5016.4 --> 5019.04
break off

5017.679 --> 5021.36
because it's not strong enough for that

5019.04 --> 5022.56
then it would just collapse

5021.36 --> 5025.12
and perhaps

5022.56 --> 5026.84
yeah turn into a sun or something

5025.12 --> 5029.84
i don't

5026.84 --> 5032.719
know that this could even explain the

5029.84 --> 5034.32
myth of how jupiter might one day become

5032.719 --> 5035.92
a second son

5034.32 --> 5037.759999999999
remember that one

5035.92 --> 5039.6
yeah maybe the critical mass is just

5037.76 --> 5041.52
like oh

5039.6 --> 5044.0
and then

5041.52 --> 5045.76
it ignites and then you have a sun with

5044.0 --> 5048.4
a black hole inside just like all the

5045.76 --> 5049.92
suns or the cgi's of the sun that we get

5048.4 --> 5052.239
see

5049.92 --> 5052.2390000000005
right

5053.6 --> 5059.360000000001
this holodeck program needs work

5056.639 --> 5059.36
this is what

5069.84 --> 5072.88
the sun is showing itself on the huddle

5071.44 --> 5074.719
deck

5072.88 --> 5076.400000000001
it's not a holodeck

5074.719 --> 5079.04
it's just that the celestials are

5076.4 --> 5081.679
holographic this is not a holodeck it's

5079.04 --> 5083.12
actually the real thing it's just that

5081.679 --> 5085.28
the lights are

5083.12 --> 5087.04
holographic

5085.28 --> 5088.88
i guess you could call it a holodeck but

5087.04 --> 5091.5199999999995
it's only the celestials that are the

5088.88 --> 5095.400000000001
whole the holographic part of it

5091.52 --> 5095.400000000001
it's just the lighting is holographic

5128.56 --> 5132.2390000000005
you don't know what holographic is

5131.36 --> 5134.0
uh

5132.239 --> 5136.48
so i guess you haven't really been

5134.0 --> 5137.84
following my channel

5136.48 --> 5140.0
since i've been

5137.84 --> 5143.04
explaining that sort of a thing for the

5140.0 --> 5147.159
last five years on a regular basis

5143.04 --> 5147.159
including on the flat earth debates

5164.48 --> 5171.44
oh by the way i'm gonna

5166.8 --> 5171.4400000000005
have special here i got some apple pie

5175.44 --> 5179.839999999999
it wasn't a discount so like

5177.52 --> 5183.6
literally like cost me a euro for this

5179.84 --> 5186.08
big chunk of apple pie

5183.6 --> 5189.04
but i can't leave it in the

5186.08 --> 5191.04
in the cooler for too long

5189.04 --> 5193.28
then it'll expire so i'm just gonna

5191.04 --> 5195.76
since i am kind of hungry and i did have

5193.28 --> 5199.679
it just sitting there

5195.76 --> 5203.12
i'm gonna eat a bit of apple pie

5199.679 --> 5203.12
it's been a long time

5208.32 --> 5210.799999999999
right

5209.28 --> 5211.84
and seriously

5210.8 --> 5214.639
this

5211.84 --> 5216.96
this entire thing for just a euro that's

5214.639 --> 5219.52
incredible it's organic

5216.96 --> 5219.52
incredible

5220.8 --> 5226.4800000000005
that's a really big chunk i i won't be

5222.88 --> 5226.4800000000005
able to eat this all in one go

5227.679 --> 5233.04
i skipped my lunch to watch this show

5229.52 --> 5233.040000000001
sorry about that geo shifter

5234.88 --> 5237.88
hmm

5240.159 --> 5242.4
hmm

5242.96 --> 5247.719
that's good

5244.08 --> 5247.719
it's not too sweet

5253.52 --> 5255.76
oh

5255.84 --> 5262.679
wow that

5258.4 --> 5262.679
that's really good apple pie

5269.679 --> 5272.719
and just look at that

5272.88 --> 5276.4400000000005
that's just delicious

5290.719 --> 5293.719
hmm

5295.84 --> 5300.639
yeah thank you service day

5297.679 --> 5300.639
i am enjoying it

5305.84 --> 5310.159000000001
i like cream pies yeah i mean not so

5307.92 --> 5310.159
much

5313.92 --> 5317.4400000000005
but i really do like apple pie but only

5315.92 --> 5320.639
when it's made

5317.44 --> 5320.638999999999
when it's made correctly

5321.12 --> 5325.199
and this one's great

5323.52 --> 5327.040000000001
but i'm already kind of full i just had

5325.199 --> 5330.48
two bites out of it and i'm like yeah

5327.04 --> 5330.48
that's good i'm good

5331.28 --> 5335.04
oh but that really did hit the spot

5335.199 --> 5338.5599999999995
technically i haven't really eaten

5337.04 --> 5341.199
anything in

5338.56 --> 5344.8
at least 12 hours so

5341.199 --> 5344.799999999999
wait no me way more

5346.639 --> 5350.6
16 hours so

5350.8 --> 5354.320000000001
right

5352.32 --> 5357.84
because i for some reason there's

5354.32 --> 5357.84
something going on down there

5359.12 --> 5362.4
yesterday evening yeah

5362.96 --> 5366.719
i had like a big dinner

5364.8 --> 5369.360000000001
and then it just

5366.719 --> 5371.6
i was too full and it just wouldn't sink

5369.36 --> 5372.96
like and after two hours after i had

5371.6 --> 5375.84
eaten it

5372.96 --> 5375.84
i threw it up

5376.08 --> 5379.92
and then i felt so much better and it

5377.84 --> 5382.88
just hadn't eaten anything after that so

5379.92 --> 5384.719
i don't know what's going on down there

5382.88 --> 5387.679
maybe it has to do something with me not

5384.719 --> 5389.84
taking vitamin d3 i'm kind of gonna ask

5387.679 --> 5393.639
my healer about it as soon as i can get

5389.84 --> 5393.639
him on the line

5393.76 --> 5396.159000000001
it's just

5397.6 --> 5403.52
right but whatever is going on at least

5399.52 --> 5403.52
my focus is not disrupted

5405.76 --> 5410.400000000001
except when i eat too much

5408.32 --> 5413.36
because then it literally hurt it like

5410.4 --> 5413.36
physically hurt me

5417.6 --> 5423.280000000001
i want one of the star trek food

5419.28 --> 5423.28
replicators bad decision

5424.0 --> 5427.679
you have to realize that everything that

5425.6 --> 5430.2390000000005
comes out of those things is non-living

5427.679 --> 5433.12
food it's all dead

5430.239 --> 5435.678999999999
it's artificially assembled it was never

5433.12 --> 5438.48
a living thing

5435.679 --> 5438.4800000000005
that doesn't work

5446.32 --> 5451.5199999999995
it's kind of funny because even in uh

5448.88 --> 5453.36
star trek voyager the series they even

5451.52 --> 5455.4400000000005
recognize that right that's why they

5453.36 --> 5458.799999999999
have their own cook that actually like

5455.44 --> 5460.96
every time they go to some planet they

5458.8 --> 5465.360000000001
they like skirmish for

5460.96 --> 5467.92
or the nelix skirmishes for local

5465.36 --> 5469.759999999999
fauna and flora for the food because

5467.92 --> 5472.56
it's fresh and it's better and like

5469.76 --> 5476.639
everybody agrees to that yeah i pay

5472.56 --> 5478.4800000000005
attention to those kind of things

5476.639 --> 5481.28
it could feed the masses yeah and then

5478.48 --> 5484.759999999999
everybody would just be

5481.28 --> 5484.759999999999
equally miserable

5505.04 --> 5508.32
people who say you do your own research

5507.04 --> 5510.48
is annoying

5508.32 --> 5513.92
well when they're saying it right in the

5510.48 --> 5516.48
middle of a verbal debate

5513.92 --> 5519.1990000000005
right when you're in chat

5516.48 --> 5520.718999999999
that's literally like yeah

5519.199 --> 5522.879999999999
get off my back

5520.719 --> 5526.32
i'm not gonna explain every freaking

5522.88 --> 5528.8
detail to you random person in chat that

5526.32 --> 5532.799999999999
doesn't actually care that much that's

5528.8 --> 5534.96
just trying to get in my way

5532.8 --> 5537.6
yeah that is annoying

5534.96 --> 5540.8
when you're actually in a face-to-face

5537.6 --> 5543.76
debate right when you're actually in a

5540.8 --> 5543.76
on a live stream

5544.0 --> 5547.84
and you ask them a question

5548.4 --> 5552.159
and then they say do your own research

5550.08 --> 5553.28
yeah that is kind of annoying

5552.159 --> 5555.44
if they just

5553.28 --> 5557.36
use it as an excuse not to explain it

5555.44 --> 5560.159
when they're supposed to because you're

5557.36 --> 5561.759999999999
in a stream together to do that yeah

5560.159 --> 5563.679
then it's annoying

5561.76 --> 5566.08
in chat

5563.679 --> 5568.4800000000005
it's just a way to just let somebody

5566.08 --> 5570.4
know like yeah you really want to know

5568.48 --> 5571.919999999999
well do your own research

5570.4 --> 5574.159
i'm not going to tell you because i

5571.92 --> 5579.08
don't give a [ __ ] about you random

5574.159 --> 5579.08
person in chat that's just nagging me

5598.96 --> 5603.6
you agree that it was annoying inside

5601.199 --> 5607.28
yet no no you're taking my words out of

5603.6 --> 5607.280000000001
whack now that's not what i said

5610.08 --> 5614.32
i mean i don't like the phrase i don't

5612.639 --> 5615.92
use it i don't tell people to do their

5614.32 --> 5617.44
own research because if they really

5615.92 --> 5619.6
wanted to know

5617.44 --> 5622.32
i would have already figured that out

5619.6 --> 5624.159000000001
through the way they talk to me

5622.32 --> 5626.4
usually when people say do your own

5624.159 --> 5629.759999999999
research it means get the [ __ ] off my

5626.4 --> 5632.239
back you whining gamma wanker

5629.76 --> 5634.159000000001
that's what that means

5632.239 --> 5636.0
if you really wanted to be informed you

5634.159 --> 5639.48
would have proven that by the way you

5636.0 --> 5639.48
addressed me

5653.44 --> 5658.799999999999
compelling internet content indeed

5656.639 --> 5660.8
i basically revolutionized the entire

5658.8 --> 5661.84
heliocentric model

5660.8 --> 5663.84
today

5661.84 --> 5666.400000000001
in a whimsy

5663.84 --> 5668.400000000001
in a whimsy i just did that

5666.4 --> 5670.159
because i felt like it

5668.4 --> 5673.159
kind of wanted to show off against phil

5670.159 --> 5673.159
bell

5674.0 --> 5680.28
which is a really silly thing to want

5676.96 --> 5680.28
by the way

5692.639 --> 5698.0
yeah seeking star wars isn't that always

5695.52 --> 5699.4400000000005
it's always the people that are in the

5698.0 --> 5702.8
show

5699.44 --> 5704.32
complaining about how it's boring

5702.8 --> 5705.84
but

5704.32 --> 5707.84
they could just

5705.84 --> 5710.08
do something else right there's other

5707.84 --> 5712.400000000001
streams there's like millions and

5710.08 --> 5714.32
millions of live streams going on right

5712.4 --> 5715.599999999999
now all over the place about all kinds

5714.32 --> 5718.4
of things

5715.6 --> 5720.320000000001
right but no no you had to come here and

5718.4 --> 5725.5599999999995
tell us how

5720.32 --> 5725.5599999999995
or sarcastically how compelling it was

5736.32 --> 5742.159
who unless you weren't being sarcastic

5738.639 --> 5746.32
and english is not your first language

5742.159 --> 5746.32
and you were being literal i don't know

5747.28 --> 5752.92
doesn't seem like it to me

5749.52 --> 5752.92
at this moment

5757.76 --> 5763.119000000001
they also could just finally prove their

5760.48 --> 5766.799999999999
globe model and it for us

5763.119 --> 5766.799999999999
oh yeah i have another one for you

5767.119 --> 5771.5199999999995
let's let's get this crazy model going

5770.4 --> 5772.48
right

5771.52 --> 5774.4800000000005
so

5772.48 --> 5776.638999999999
i figured out that if there's going to

5774.48 --> 5776.638999999999
be

5777.119 --> 5781.5199999999995
micro black holes at the center of every

5779.6 --> 5783.280000000001
planet and that would also be the thing

5781.52 --> 5785.360000000001
that's

5783.28 --> 5787.599999999999
keeping it together and that maybe keeps

5785.36 --> 5789.599999999999
the atmosphere to it

5787.6 --> 5791.360000000001
well then maybe it's the

5789.6 --> 5793.280000000001
that black hole

5791.36 --> 5796.88
space-time bending that's actually

5793.28 --> 5796.88
causing terrestrial refraction

5796.96 --> 5801.89
duh

5798.73 --> 5801.889999999999
[Music]

5820.32 --> 5824.159
yeah who've ever thought that

5822.08 --> 5827.84
terrestrial refraction was actually

5824.159 --> 5827.839999999999
caused by the bending of space time

5827.92 --> 5832.04
that's pretty riveting right

5841.36 --> 5844.639
yeah kevlar i know

5845.84 --> 5850.56
but that's fine right

5848.4 --> 5852.839999999999
as long as they know everything i've

5850.56 --> 5855.1990000000005
said ever by

5852.84 --> 5857.28
heart that's okay they don't have to

5855.199 --> 5859.119
understand it as long as they just

5857.28 --> 5861.199
contain

5859.119 --> 5863.119
my information in their memory and then

5861.199 --> 5865.919999999999
later somebody will figure out how to

5863.119 --> 5865.92
get it out of them

5866.84 --> 5870.639
right

5868.719 --> 5873.52
this is actually very encouraging when

5870.639 --> 5875.28
somebody in chat that's like whiney

5873.52 --> 5877.6
actually suddenly proves in a moment

5875.28 --> 5879.599999999999
that they know very a lot of detail

5877.6 --> 5881.679
about something that i said at some

5879.6 --> 5885.119000000001
point

5881.679 --> 5885.119
it's kind of fascinating to me

5885.679 --> 5890.2390000000005
it's like oh you have so much trouble

5887.92 --> 5891.28
gripping something but then when you

5890.239 --> 5892.638999999999
suddenly

5891.28 --> 5895.36
notice like

5892.639 --> 5897.679
like who you can

5895.36 --> 5900.0
prove somebody wrong

5897.679 --> 5901.119
then suddenly you know every freaking

5900.0 --> 5903.04
detail

5901.119 --> 5905.44
it's kind of fascinating to me when that

5903.04 --> 5905.44
happens

5907.119 --> 5911.36
and it's kind of stupid when they're

5908.8 --> 5915.4400000000005
just completely wrong which then proves

5911.36 --> 5915.44
that they haven't paid attention at all

5920.4 --> 5925.839999999999
okay jose

5922.159 --> 5925.839999999999
you voca now

5928.0 --> 5933.92
please give rectangular looping earth a

5930.32 --> 5933.92
shout out sure why not

5934.159 --> 5938.119
it's only a model though

5949.6 --> 5953.159000000001
sextant offenders

5982.96 --> 5987.6
they have a lot of trouble

5985.52 --> 5989.4400000000005
with that with the sexton they really

5987.6 --> 5991.280000000001
just they're just at this point just

5989.44 --> 5992.159
gaslighting themselves like saying like

5991.28 --> 5995.119
oh

5992.159 --> 5997.28
just upholding the myth and the story

5995.119 --> 5998.639
like no it does actually work on the

5997.28 --> 6000.48
globe

5998.639 --> 6002.159000000001
and that's just all they do it's not

6000.48 --> 6005.36
just us and then they start to like

6002.159 --> 6009.04
supposedly roll out how they're doing it

6005.36 --> 6010.96
and then they overlook all these details

6009.04 --> 6012.159
about how it doesn't work so they just

6010.96 --> 6015.84
like

6012.159 --> 6019.119
breakingly do it they do it broken on

6015.84 --> 6021.1990000000005
purpose to kind of like not let it sink

6019.119 --> 6024.239
in that it actually does require a flat

6021.199 --> 6026.48
plate in every conceivable up yeah

6024.239 --> 6027.759999999999
every conceivable way it does require a

6026.48 --> 6030.08
flat plane

6027.76 --> 6032.4800000000005
to operate a sextant right i've even

6030.08 --> 6035.199
tried to bypass it with terrestrial

6032.48 --> 6036.718999999999
refraction kind of effectively it's it's

6035.199 --> 6039.28
giving nathan a headache every time i

6036.719 --> 6039.28
bring it up

6040.8 --> 6046.2390000000005
but nobody seems to care

6043.44 --> 6048.4
like seriously they're not cohesive in

6046.239 --> 6050.799999999999
their response they just try to

6048.4 --> 6052.799999999999
maneuver their way through kind of half

6050.8 --> 6054.2390000000005
ignorant and just like make a whole

6052.8 --> 6056.0
bunch of mistakes but because there's

6054.239 --> 6057.5199999999995
nobody there to tell them about how

6056.0 --> 6060.32
they're making a mistake about it in the

6057.52 --> 6063.119000000001
moment that's why it works

6060.32 --> 6065.36
so in a way it's almost like the boats

6063.119 --> 6067.119
going over the horizon proving earth

6065.36 --> 6068.88
curve once again

6067.119 --> 6071.44
it's that level of ignorance that's how

6068.88 --> 6072.88
they're treating the sextant

6071.44 --> 6074.239
so they're constantly saying no it works

6072.88 --> 6076.88
like hey if

6074.239 --> 6079.678999999999
20 anti-flat earthers make

6076.88 --> 6081.84
10 videos over the course of a year

6079.679 --> 6083.36
so very confidently exclaiming no this

6081.84 --> 6085.76
is all ridiculous these flat earths are

6083.36 --> 6087.44
crazy sex didn't work on the globe of

6085.76 --> 6088.96
course they do look this is what you do

6087.44 --> 6090.96
that's what you do

6088.96 --> 6094.0
and then it doesn't technically make any

6090.96 --> 6094.96
sense but most people again they don't

6094.0 --> 6097.52
have

6094.96 --> 6100.88
the yeah the knowledge

6097.52 --> 6102.639
the acumen to actually see that

6100.88 --> 6103.76
unless they follow the flat earth

6102.639 --> 6106.4800000000005
debates

6103.76 --> 6108.8
and then they know every sickening

6106.48 --> 6110.959999999999
boring yeah sometimes boring little

6108.8 --> 6112.320000000001
technical detail about it and how it is

6110.96 --> 6113.92
wrong and then they can certainly point

6112.32 --> 6116.799999999999
that like i'll fight the flat earth or

6113.92 --> 6120.08
simon down or any of these idiots

6116.8 --> 6122.4800000000005
oh they're just doing it wrong just

6120.08 --> 6122.48
wrong

6127.119 --> 6130.839999999999
it's what it is

6134.239 --> 6139.5199999999995
yeah lydia logs

6136.96 --> 6142.159
you can stop spamming that

6139.52 --> 6145.360000000001
misinformation he's never gonna give

6142.159 --> 6145.36
that money to anybody

6146.84 --> 6151.76
ever i don't think he even has that kind

6149.44 --> 6154.96
of money and if he did it would be

6151.76 --> 6158.4400000000005
absolutely insane to just

6154.96 --> 6158.44
hand that out

6169.04 --> 6174.719
right yes len lenox definitely i could

6172.0 --> 6179.04
sir use paypal donations i still need it

6174.719 --> 6180.0
i got debts i need to get rid of them

6179.04 --> 6182.32
before

6180.0 --> 6182.32
yeah

6182.96 --> 6189.88
before my entire financial situation

6186.0 --> 6189.88
just completely implodes

6193.52 --> 6196.88
which will still take some time but it

6196.0 --> 6200.08
will

6196.88 --> 6202.639
get to that point if i don't like

6200.08 --> 6205.04
get rid of these debts

6202.639 --> 6206.96
so i'd really appreciate the support

6205.04 --> 6209.36
through paypal

6206.96 --> 6211.52
and i want to again thank flatter sage

6209.36 --> 6213.5199999999995

in recent times and really helping me

6213.52 --> 6219.92
out helping me to get by

6216.32 --> 6223.28

6219.92 --> 6223.28
so thank you for that my friend

6236.4 --> 6241.44
in american written with ck but that's

6239.199 --> 6244.159
fine

6241.44 --> 6247.839999999999
right yeah have a good day

6244.159 --> 6247.839999999999
i think i'm gonna round out the show

we live in the goldilocks zone

6259.52 --> 6265.1990000000005
science that's larry that's a hilarious

6261.44 --> 6265.199
thing to say rath it is

really receive it right i try to remind

6339.04 --> 6345.239
everybody you hate paypal but

6341.52 --> 6345.2390000000005
get some of this

6345.36 --> 6350.08
yeah look

6346.8 --> 6352.320000000001
i'm not exactly a fan of like paypal's

6350.08 --> 6354.5599999999995
management but they've kind of left me

6352.32 --> 6356.84
alone at least

6354.56 --> 6359.92
so it's just really worked out for me

6356.84 --> 6362.0
technically i i don't morally support

6359.92 --> 6363.04
like the paypal

6362.0 --> 6365.36
people

6363.04 --> 6367.92
the management but at least they've left

6365.36 --> 6367.92
me alone

6368.96 --> 6373.44
right

6370.4 --> 6375.599999999999
and yeah it's what it is

6373.44 --> 6377.599999999999
right anyway thanks everyone for coming

6406.4 --> 6411.04
thought it was interesting it's very

6408.4 --> 6413.119
focused good i was kind of worried

6411.04 --> 6415.36
yesterday night that i might not do a

6413.119 --> 6419.44
stream but then

6415.36 --> 6420.88
this morning i felt a lot better so

6419.44 --> 6422.879999999999
right yeah

6420.88 --> 6424.4800000000005
i'm gonna join the flat earth debates

6422.88 --> 6426.96
right after this it should start up in

6424.48 --> 6430.0
about five minutes on nathan oakley 9080

6426.96 --> 6430.96
channel to see you there in chat

6430.0 --> 6433.04
and

6430.96 --> 6436.02
until the next video

6433.04 --> 6446.8
keep it flat

6436.02 --> 6449.570000000001
[Music]

6446.8 --> 6467.31
[ __ ]

6449.57 --> 6467.3099999999995
[Music]

6479.679 --> 6483.679
if the surface of earth is flat i've

6481.76 --> 6485.119000000001
already stated that several times now

6483.679 --> 6486.96
you're talking about beach balls and

6485.119 --> 6488.32
begging the question of spheres you

6486.96 --> 6489.52
still haven't acknowledged whether or

6488.32 --> 6492.88
not you understand what a begging the

6489.52 --> 6494.96
question fallacy is do you or don't you

6492.88 --> 6496.56
i absolutely do what's the beginning the

6494.96 --> 6498.88
question fallacy

6496.56 --> 6500.4800000000005
i believe you're doing it i'm not doing

6498.88 --> 6502.639
anything i'm talking about triangulation

6500.48 --> 6505.44
that's facts not begging the question of

6502.639 --> 6508.32
anything if you are triangulating you

6505.44 --> 6509.919999999999
will fact have a straight flat baseline

6508.32 --> 6512.159
that's not begging the question that's a

6509.92 --> 6514.2390000000005
fact

6512.159 --> 6516.159
agree with that one right so now when

6514.239 --> 6517.599999999999
you say if we're negotiating a sphere

6516.159 --> 6519.5199999999995
that's you begging the question do you

6517.6 --> 6523.4400000000005
understand

6519.52 --> 6525.76
but you're saying do you understand

6523.44 --> 6528.0
of course i do so don't beg the question

6525.76 --> 6529.52
here [ __ ] don't be a [ __ ] using

6528.0 --> 6530.639
logical fallacies like assuming you're

6529.52 --> 6531.360000000001
on a sphere when you're trying to prove

6530.639 --> 6533.36
it

6531.36 --> 6535.599999999999
it's a logical fallacy wait a minute

6533.36 --> 6539.719
stop talking through the middle of me

6535.6 --> 6539.719
stop talking through me

6544.719 --> 6546.8
you
