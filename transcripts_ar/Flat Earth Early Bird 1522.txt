7.79 --> 37.159
[Music]

87.119 --> 90.96
I can always use the support

89.88 --> 94.439
right

90.96 --> 96.55999999999999
so today the weather's very much turned

94.439 --> 96.55999999999999
around

96.659 --> 101.93900000000001
it's well right now it's kind of nice

100.38 --> 105.42
and sunny and

101.939 --> 107.22
just a few clouds but

105.42 --> 110.6
earlier

107.22 --> 112.79899999999999
what is it now one and a half hours ago

110.6 --> 115.91999999999999
it was actually

112.799 --> 116.93900000000001
there was big clouds and hail came out

115.92 --> 119.88
of it

116.939 --> 122.6
but it's pretty much all melted away was

119.88 --> 122.6
just very short

125.52 --> 130.16
so yeah definitely signs of spring

127.799 --> 130.16
coming

131.28 --> 135.599
it's really nice and clear

133.86 --> 139.22000000000003
though

135.599 --> 139.22
how blue that sky is

142.68 --> 144.86
thank you

149.819 --> 154.099
pretty beautiful

151.5 --> 154.099
anyway

164.519 --> 171.84
it's Saturday the 25th of

167.879 --> 171.84
February 2023

173.099 --> 176.17999999999998
check the temperature

180.8 --> 185.78
what is this

183.06 --> 185.78
why doesn't

189.48 --> 194.94
Google doesn't do any more Auto roll

191.94 --> 194.94
rollouts

195.78 --> 202.34
automatically it's weird

198.48 --> 202.34
anyway it's seven degrees Celsius

208.86 --> 211.58
right

212.099 --> 219.01899999999998
just a little clouded we'll see anyway

215.879 --> 219.01899999999998
yeah I'm actually

220.14 --> 223.879
really energized today

223.98 --> 229.099
I mean I'm starting to write a script

226.44 --> 229.099
for this game

229.62 --> 234.84
I'm already at a full page

232.92 --> 237.79899999999998
and it's like

234.84 --> 241.14000000000001
kind of getting to me

237.799 --> 244.5
I mean this could be pretty freaking

241.14 --> 245.94
amazing but man it's gonna be a a big

244.5 --> 248.099
thing

245.94 --> 249.299
so I'm gonna have to be very tactical

248.099 --> 252.23899999999998
about

249.299 --> 255.0
keeping it simple I mean that's always

252.239 --> 257.4
been the beginning of the game

255.0 --> 260.76
more convoluted Things become and people

257.4 --> 262.73999999999995
lose their focus also the designers will

260.76 --> 266.21999999999997
lose their focus

262.74 --> 267.3
becomes just too much

266.22 --> 271.38000000000005
right

267.3 --> 274.08
so the story power has to

271.38 --> 276.54
basically be

274.08 --> 279.65999999999997
stronger even then

276.54 --> 281.759
how elaborate it is

279.66 --> 284.52000000000004
and I'm really getting onto something

281.759 --> 287.41900000000004
weird anyway hey Adam making first to

284.52 --> 287.419
chat good to see you man

288.18 --> 290.78000000000003
uh

296.16 --> 301.02000000000004
like already got five chapters and I

298.56 --> 302.82
even got I like there's not enough space

301.02 --> 305.479
to write everything down that's in my

302.82 --> 305.479
mind right now

305.58 --> 310.56
I have to let like Let It settle down

308.46 --> 314.21999999999997
first a little

310.56 --> 317.04
before I can start just manifesting it

314.22 --> 319.52000000000004
because I got really elaborate ideas

317.04 --> 319.52000000000004
it's

328.199 --> 334.58000000000004
hey James Mays good to see you

331.74 --> 334.58
foreign

336.8 --> 340.34000000000003
to talk about it

357.18 --> 363.24
right but anyway hey LSG good to see you

360.72 --> 365.58000000000004
happy Saturday yeah

363.24 --> 367.919
seems to be a very happy Saturday for me

365.58 --> 370.68
at least

367.919 --> 373.039
yesterday was great at the Flat Earth

370.68 --> 373.039
debate

375.5 --> 378.74
good energy

380.759 --> 384.56
great conversation afterward

387.96 --> 393.71999999999997
and despite their seeming to be some

391.38 --> 396.3
conflict going on I mean apparently

393.72 --> 398.88000000000005
Michael Khan is now really pissed off

396.3 --> 401.22
with me or something he even left master

398.88 --> 405.1
B

401.22 --> 409.259
the Skype chat so I'm like whoa okay

405.1 --> 412.02000000000004
[Music]

409.259 --> 413.34000000000003
not particularly happy about that and in

412.02 --> 416.039
the meantime like

413.34 --> 418.02
Jim Bob is going completely ballistic so

416.039 --> 420.5
it seems to be a time of polarization

418.02 --> 420.5
and

422.88 --> 425.539
shifting

427.259 --> 432.319
and we'll see if they shift back when

429.84 --> 432.31899999999996
it's over

433.5 --> 437.699
so I think that a lot of people around

435.479 --> 440.15999999999997
are probably going ballistic

437.699 --> 442.759
in their own way and I mean this has

440.16 --> 442.759
happened before

447.479 --> 453.06
tensions are pretty damn high right now

449.94 --> 456.539
and they're being played up very high in

453.06 --> 456.539
the media so

457.8 --> 462.78000000000003
it's not illogical

460.02 --> 464.88
for people to basically go ballistic in

462.78 --> 467.539
that sense pressure is just becoming too

464.88 --> 467.539
much everywhere

467.94 --> 470.94
foreign

476.639 --> 481.8
and if you don't have a very clear cut

479.639 --> 484.319
mission

481.8 --> 487.8
to do certain things that are really

484.319 --> 490.02000000000004
gonna occupy your consciousness

487.8 --> 491.18
then you're gonna get caught up in the

490.02 --> 492.539
Maelstrom

491.18 --> 496.099
[Music]

492.539 --> 499.08
of the madness and basically

496.099 --> 500.94
like start to fight it and then as you

499.08 --> 503.479
fight the demon you become the demon

500.94 --> 503.479
slowly

504.199 --> 507.8
or abruptly

511.259 --> 516.839
right I basically continually risk this

514.68 --> 521.18
but yeah when I go rage win that's

516.839 --> 521.1800000000001
basically me doing that also

521.7 --> 528.36
but with the realization that

525.42 --> 531.4799999999999
like physically I don't feel I can do a

528.36 --> 533.399
lot about it although in the right

531.48 --> 536.22
circumstances I might

533.399 --> 539.6
so it's basically just role playing in a

536.22 --> 539.6
way but it's very serious

544.2 --> 547.76
and it's very real to me

548.04 --> 555.8
very honest anyway uh

552.3 --> 555.8
he's in Savage mode

558.42 --> 563.279
wait you mean Owen Benjamin or

561.36 --> 565.32
or Jim Bob

563.279 --> 567.54
I haven't even caught up that far yet

565.32 --> 570.3000000000001
I'm still I'm right now watching the

567.54 --> 572.9399999999999
episode with Gardner

570.3 --> 577.0799999999999
just started that I mean the the one

572.94 --> 582.2600000000001
before that was already pretty damn good

577.08 --> 582.26
it's in Savage mode oh so he's Terry oh

584.22 --> 589.2
so I guess the poking of the bear has uh

587.339 --> 591.6
resulted in

589.2 --> 596.4590000000001
Molly okay

591.6 --> 600.5
that's gonna be very intense then I

596.459 --> 600.5
I'll keep an eye I'll keep that in mind

600.6 --> 605.0400000000001
oh

602.04 --> 605.04
foreign

606.899 --> 612.21
I'll tell you probably tomorrow

610.2 --> 615.339
or otherwise Monday

612.21 --> 615.339
[Music]

620.72 --> 623.9590000000001
big time

625.86 --> 629.0
it okay

632.94 --> 639.32
but in what sense big time I mean

636.6 --> 639.32
man

643.339 --> 650.1800000000001
like did he go rage win or something but

647.22 --> 650.1800000000001
Bard Style

656.94 --> 661.44
whoa

658.44 --> 661.44
okay

662.279 --> 665.279
damn

665.76 --> 672.12
I'm very curious to see that actually

668.76 --> 674.779
but uh yeah I mean I'm just gonna

672.12 --> 674.779
first

674.82 --> 680.1800000000001
I'll get to it anyway thanks for the uh

677.519 --> 680.18
heads up

680.22 --> 685.86
huh

681.6 --> 690.0600000000001
in a way I he had it coming I mean

685.86 --> 692.88
look I've just had a slight Gaze on what

690.06 --> 696.3599999999999
Jim Bob has actually been doing

692.88 --> 698.16
in the recent videos I I like last few I

696.36 --> 701.6
didn't I could wouldn't even click on it

698.16 --> 701.6
it just felt so

702.24 --> 704.36
thank you

704.66 --> 712.14
so tense

707.7 --> 715.2
and negative that I'm like Ruth

712.14 --> 717.18
like this is bad I don't even need to to

715.2 --> 719.94
actually watch it to see how bad it is

717.18 --> 722.959
because I can already feel like this is

719.94 --> 722.9590000000001
not good

724.34 --> 729.839
[Music]

726.839 --> 733.5600000000001
so I can imagine that Owen probably did

729.839 --> 736.94
watch it just to see how how far Jim Bob

733.56 --> 736.9399999999999
would slide and

738.58 --> 741.7
[Music]

742.38 --> 747.8389999999999
four hours what the hell really damn

748.74 --> 754.5790000000001
the noble savage yeah four hours

751.98 --> 754.5790000000001
oh

757.68 --> 763.76
well to be fair the one with the

759.779 --> 763.76
gardener is also like four hours

763.93 --> 766.9899999999999
[Music]

769.26 --> 771.8
huh

784.16 --> 787.6999999999999
yeah intense

789.36 --> 793.15
you know what I was actually thinking

791.22 --> 794.5790000000001
but the ass is my little thing

793.15 --> 796.68
[Music]

794.579 --> 800.04
I mean

796.68 --> 802.5
technically in the Baldur's Gate three

800.04 --> 804.06
game that I'm envisioning you you can

802.5 --> 807.24
pick

804.06 --> 810.899
any type of deity you want to become

807.24 --> 814.6800000000001
right that includes bard

810.899 --> 816.779
and I was thinking like if you're gonna

814.68 --> 819.68
be like a

816.779 --> 822.18
hard God

819.68 --> 825.899
which would basically like a god of

822.18 --> 830.0999999999999
Muses and creativity and comedy

825.899 --> 833.16
well there should be then of course a

830.1 --> 838.019
specific Tinker Tailor to that kind of

833.16 --> 840.24
deity role by challenges like

838.019 --> 843.18
a comedy standoff

840.24 --> 845.04
and music creativity

843.18 --> 846.18
but like

845.04 --> 849.36
yeah

846.18 --> 851.279
which would probably mostly be like even

849.36 --> 853.5600000000001
basically

851.279 --> 856.4399999999999
animated pieces like it doesn't have to

853.56 --> 859.4399999999999
even be like a piece of the game or it

856.44 --> 862.2600000000001
could be like with comedy that it's just

859.44 --> 865.0790000000001
like an event and it could be voice and

862.26 --> 869.16
oh my God it would be so awesome if oh

865.079 --> 871.3199999999999
Benjamin could be like The Bard King

869.16 --> 872.88
Like A Champion of

871.32 --> 876.5
well of

872.88 --> 876.5
probably of the opponent

877.68 --> 882.899
and then ah I don't know maybe I'm just

880.139 --> 886.26
dreaming a bit too much

882.899 --> 888.54
but because I mean he would if he would

886.26 --> 891.959
be drawn into that and not just think

888.54 --> 895.019
it's okay because it's India but hey

891.959 --> 898.68
um I mean oh my God what would be more

895.019 --> 903.0600000000001
awesome than Owen Benjamin in Baldur's

898.68 --> 907.079
Gate game like Battle of the deities

903.06 --> 910.4399999999999
and music and a barred off

907.079 --> 913.56
to then have jokes about how gay the

910.44 --> 916.4590000000001
endears are because I would absolutely

913.56 --> 916.459
permit that

916.519 --> 920.639
I mean bro

921.839 --> 927.12
I think he would agree to do that

924.899 --> 928.26
because he would get it would be very

927.12 --> 931.26
him

928.26 --> 933.48
and yeah he could do his thing like

931.26 --> 936.8
within the game just have

933.48 --> 936.8000000000001
a couple of routines

937.199 --> 940.5
and he would re like with his voice and

939.72 --> 943.26
everything

940.5 --> 945.66
yeah no [ __ ] that would be epic

943.26 --> 947.54
and it's like made for him it's like

945.66 --> 949.74
part of the Gods

947.54 --> 952.92
[Music]

949.74 --> 955.32
a God himself

952.92 --> 957.4799999999999
or well maybe he could maybe he would

955.32 --> 960.98
even strike up for that as a possibility

957.48 --> 960.98
to be like an opponent

961.019 --> 965.66
God but I mean he would not be the

963.42 --> 968.279
player character right so

965.66 --> 970.079
player characters

968.279 --> 972.899
I mean that would be weird because then

970.079 --> 976.199
anybody could like oh

972.899 --> 979.32
if he's your Bard in the game

976.199 --> 981.7199999999999
then anybody can just pick him out and

979.32 --> 985.139
like be all gamma with him or whatever

981.72 --> 987.3000000000001
right that's annoying

985.139 --> 990.42
what if he's an opponent then it's much

987.3 --> 994.199
more set as how he will behave and like

990.42 --> 996.24
his message will be his message right

994.199 --> 998.9399999999999
and it will be freaking funny and

996.24 --> 1001.779
confrontational and

998.94 --> 1001.7790000000001
foreign

1005.259 --> 1010.6990000000001
we're so funny and everybody laughs but

1008.72 --> 1014.62
actual jokes

1010.699 --> 1014.62
that are not just superficial

1016.16 --> 1021.259
right anyway

1018.32 --> 1022.82
that would be like an element to it I

1021.259 --> 1025.459
mean because there's going to be so many

1022.82 --> 1026.48
different types of deities you could

1025.459 --> 1029.419
become

1026.48 --> 1033.14
I mean very nature themed

1029.419 --> 1035.1200000000001
very magic theme very technology scene

1033.14 --> 1037.939
then there would be

1035.12 --> 1040.04
oppositions

1037.939 --> 1043.699
like natural and like whatever you're

1040.04 --> 1046.28
gonna pick deities that have

1043.699 --> 1048.0790000000002
like oppositional positions will then

1046.28 --> 1050.66
become naturally

1048.079 --> 1052.6399999999999
a bit of your opponent and or contested

1050.66 --> 1056.0
and you can have like

1052.64 --> 1057.919
just like Kingswood contracts on how to

1056.0 --> 1060.38
deal

1057.919 --> 1063.98
but yeah basically deals with each other

1060.38 --> 1067.46
to keep the peace or to set like the the

1063.98 --> 1068.9
settings for war between however you're

1067.46 --> 1071.6000000000001
going to deal with it right

1068.9 --> 1074.0800000000002
and to basically do that on a deity

1071.6 --> 1074.08
scale

1076.039 --> 1081.22
mocking multiplier times what

1087.86 --> 1092.0
I wasn't really thinking of Owen

1089.96 --> 1094.52
Benjamin like as an adventure character

1092.0 --> 1096.86
that would be smashing already maybe

1094.52 --> 1099.1399999999999
he'd go for that maybe you could

1096.86 --> 1101.8999999999999
actually be a Bard in the in the game

1099.14 --> 1105.3200000000002
like just like Minsk

1101.9 --> 1107.7800000000002
the crazy Ranger with the hamster who is

1105.32 --> 1110.059
freaking hilarious really in my opinion

1107.78 --> 1113.539
I really love that character

1110.059 --> 1116.48
it's so rambunctious is so spontaneous

1113.539 --> 1118.039
and silly but really serious at the same

1116.48 --> 1119.6
time I love it

1118.039 --> 1121.58
right I mean there's some really

1119.6 --> 1122.7199999999998
interesting developed characters in

1121.58 --> 1126.26
there

1122.72 --> 1128.1200000000001
and oh yeah but I mean

1126.26 --> 1131.48
I don't think Owen would ever like

1128.12 --> 1134.2399999999998
really want to be a character like that

1131.48 --> 1138.02
I think but I think he would love to be

1134.24 --> 1141.679
like the face of high comedy at the

1138.02 --> 1144.799
Battle of the bards basically

1141.679 --> 1146.0590000000002
I think he would want to take part in

1144.799 --> 1148.52
that

1146.059 --> 1150.9189999999999
and I'd probably give him like a leading

1148.52 --> 1152.72
role which he would deserve

1150.919 --> 1154.94
like within the game

1152.72 --> 1159.7
it would be The Bard King absolutely

1154.94 --> 1159.7
anyway it's I'm just dreaming right now

1167.84 --> 1173.299
I'm just taking it all in an insanely

1170.539 --> 1176.48
grandiose scale but I mean

1173.299 --> 1178.52
to really accomplish that it takes so

1176.48 --> 1180.44
much work and creativity because I will

1178.52 --> 1182.9
want a high standard I mean it's going

1180.44 --> 1185.24
to be like freaking game of the Gods is

1182.9 --> 1187.039
not to be taken lightly

1185.24 --> 1191.799
I mean

1187.039 --> 1191.799
all of d d is watching basically

1192.74 --> 1197.36
I just think that well there's a good

1195.32 --> 1199.1
chance that I would have to be involved

1197.36 --> 1201.559
with Wizards of the Coast since it is

1199.1 --> 1204.08
well there

1201.559 --> 1206.6789999999999
Heritage their intellectual Heritage

1204.08 --> 1206.6789999999999
basically

1207.5 --> 1212.84
that's going to be an issue

1210.08 --> 1215.48
because otherwise if there's no point

1212.84 --> 1217.1
like it has to be a continuation of that

1215.48 --> 1219.08
universe

1217.1 --> 1220.82
and I don't even know everything about

1219.08 --> 1222.74
that Universe there would be a lot I

1220.82 --> 1223.52
would have to catch up on to but what I

1222.74 --> 1227.299
want

1223.52 --> 1229.6
it to be is to really be an extension of

1227.299 --> 1229.6
that

1230.48 --> 1233.2
in a way

1233.419 --> 1238.76
and so I there's probably much to learn

1235.94 --> 1243.02
even about how people

1238.76 --> 1246.74
in the DND Community have been seeing

1243.02 --> 1247.82
the roles and functioning of those Gods

1246.74 --> 1249.919
what they're like they're probably

1247.82 --> 1251.72
already have been many people that have

1249.919 --> 1252.8600000000001
attempted to assign certain types of

1251.72 --> 1255.14
personality

1252.86 --> 1256.6999999999998
so I it would be great to be able to

1255.14 --> 1261.14
figure that out

1256.7 --> 1261.14
in order to really not

1262.4 --> 1265.5800000000002
yeah

1263.78 --> 1268.7
it

1265.58 --> 1270.62
the Gods in there that are going to be

1268.7 --> 1274.22
dealt with will have would have to be

1270.62 --> 1277.9399999999998
relatable to the original

1274.22 --> 1280.82
thinking Heritage of that Realm

1277.94 --> 1285.28
and I am not the most fanatical

1280.82 --> 1285.28
Forgotten Realms expert to be fair

1288.2 --> 1295.4
because it's a different type of

1291.08 --> 1297.5
more elaborate more detailed universe as

1295.4 --> 1299.6000000000001
just the standard Dungeons and Dragons

1297.5 --> 1303.039
deity cosmology even though it's

1299.6 --> 1303.039
definitely based on that

1306.2 --> 1308.8600000000001
anyway

1312.14 --> 1317.8400000000001
right but because if it wasn't Baldur's

1315.5 --> 1320.72
Gate it then

1317.84 --> 1323.72
it just like it would be just oh like oh

1320.72 --> 1325.94
become a Pantheon deity and oh but yeah

1323.72 --> 1330.88
it might be cool

1325.94 --> 1330.88
but it would then just be another game

1335.78 --> 1340.3999999999999
it would probably be more like an

1338.0 --> 1342.62
advanced Dragon Age game or something

1340.4 --> 1344.799
and it's just uh

1342.62 --> 1344.799
foreign

1346.179 --> 1353.3600000000001
as you get in game that's that elaborate

1350.12 --> 1356.9599999999998
with like full 3d Graphics it becomes

1353.36 --> 1358.8799999999999
just such a huge colossal thing it's

1356.96 --> 1361.3600000000001
like very unlikely to be accomplished

1358.88 --> 1361.3600000000001
that's why

1361.4 --> 1366.02
I really kind of want to hold on to the

1364.4 --> 1368.74
original

1366.02 --> 1368.74
format

1371.24 --> 1379.76
and just have more

1375.2 --> 1384.0800000000002
like video clips in between and a vast

1379.76 --> 1386.0
Library basically of different type like

1384.08 --> 1388.58
chapter changes

1386.0 --> 1391.1
but then like different routes of

1388.58 --> 1394.58
chapters isn't so it would be yeah it's

1391.1 --> 1398.8999999999999
not just a linear thing anymore

1394.58 --> 1402.3999999999999
but like multiple linear systems that

1398.9 --> 1405.6200000000001
could like rearrange certain locations

1402.4 --> 1408.38
in a slightly different setting but

1405.62 --> 1411.26
mostly the same characters right because

1408.38 --> 1414.44
it's like as an ID you're gonna like

1411.26 --> 1417.2
completely be influencing

1414.44 --> 1419.6000000000001
how everything works

1417.2 --> 1422.419
out there in the realm

1419.6 --> 1425.0
and yeah so to have kind of a system for

1422.419 --> 1428.5
that I've got it kind of puzzled out

1425.0 --> 1428.5
roughly in my mind anyway

1428.78 --> 1431.32
ah

1436.1 --> 1442.58
right but because there's gonna be so

1438.38 --> 1444.98
such a wide variety of the way things

1442.58 --> 1446.96
could roll out as a story

1444.98 --> 1449.78
it's going to be basically multiple

1446.96 --> 1452.539
storyline branches that do not connect

1449.78 --> 1455.08
up necessarily or but they don't have to

1452.539 --> 1457.7
because it's all about how everything

1455.08 --> 1459.32
interconnects among the deities and in

1457.7 --> 1463.179
the realm

1459.32 --> 1465.5
and then it would move towards standard

1463.179 --> 1468.94
outcome results

1465.5 --> 1468.94
is basically like okay

1469.58 --> 1476.36
big evil Fortress

1472.9 --> 1478.159
free lands and who is actually taking up

1476.36 --> 1481.039
that evil Fortress and who is actually

1478.159 --> 1483.7
in opposition and then with their Styles

1481.039 --> 1483.7
and techniques

1487.58 --> 1492.039
but I mean dude there's like already

1493.58 --> 1500.299
like what I've worked on five chapters

1496.64 --> 1502.22
that's just like one full game and it's

1500.299 --> 1504.52
already so much happening in there it's

1502.22 --> 1504.52
crazy

1505.22 --> 1510.26
ah

1507.74 --> 1511.76
like I'm afraid to even make it bigger

1510.26 --> 1514.72
like it couldn't be One gaming where

1511.76 --> 1514.72
it's just too freaking big

1519.76 --> 1523.6589999999999
anyway hey tiger bear

1527.58 --> 1530.6899999999998
[Music]

1539.059 --> 1543.66
foreign

1540.2 --> 1543.66
[Music]

1550.82 --> 1555.62
just staring at my script I'm like I

1553.22 --> 1557.299
kind of want to write more I I don't

1555.62 --> 1560.6
know I think I might be in the real

1557.299 --> 1563.32
creative flow all of a sudden

1560.6 --> 1563.32
it's been a while

1572.299 --> 1577.94
anyway

1575.179 --> 1580.52
feeling great but I'm getting a little

1577.94 --> 1583.76
obsessive with this

1580.52 --> 1586.6
do you write stories

1583.76 --> 1586.6
uh

1586.88 --> 1589.6000000000001
no

1590.24 --> 1594.4
I like stories to write themselves

1594.44 --> 1598.76
it's just I write setups

1599.779 --> 1605.9
it's like that's how the whole

1602.659 --> 1607.64
game went with my game yeah with my d d

1605.9 --> 1611.539
group

1607.64 --> 1614.6200000000001
is I just write the setup and then they

1611.539 --> 1614.62
write the story

1614.72 --> 1620.679
basically they basically yeah determine

1617.6 --> 1620.6789999999999
what the characters do

1623.29 --> 1626.3899999999999
[Music]

1627.02 --> 1631.24
right

1628.159 --> 1631.24
that's the whole point

1633.98 --> 1638.419
in d d anyway uh

1640.34 --> 1645.02
but yeah as a game master you can

1642.44 --> 1647.48
improvise a lot more of course you you

1645.02 --> 1649.76
can imagine entire characters and

1647.48 --> 1653.059
stories and backgrounds right out of

1649.76 --> 1655.94
your ass as an improvisation

1653.059 --> 1661.12
literally yeah in an actual computer

1655.94 --> 1661.1200000000001
game that's not doable

1667.46 --> 1672.159
or if it would be it would scare me

1669.5 --> 1672.159
anyway

1673.88 --> 1676.88
foreign

1677.86 --> 1684.6789999999999
yeah exactly that's what I do

1681.38 --> 1687.64
a LSG you want to read

1684.679 --> 1687.64
this one too

1690.26 --> 1692.919
send it

1705.26 --> 1707.86
foreign

1717.5 --> 1723.2
this is what I got so far

1720.32 --> 1726.559
it's gonna extend this is like the third

1723.2 --> 1728.779
version already so I I got it back

1726.559 --> 1733.1
that's what happens I write just a few

1728.779 --> 1735.08
sentence then just expands expands like

1733.1 --> 1737.36
I first just thought I'm just going to

1735.08 --> 1739.6999999999998
make a note on paper

1737.36 --> 1741.3799999999999
and then it just wouldn't stop

1739.7 --> 1743.24
and then I realized I gotta get to

1741.38 --> 1747.38
computer because

1743.24 --> 1749.5
you could just make space

1747.38 --> 1753.3400000000001
instead of having to rewrite everything

1749.5 --> 1753.34
on a new piece of paper

1753.62 --> 1756.1
so

1757.7 --> 1761.779
right yeah tell me what you think at

1760.279 --> 1764.36
least

1761.779 --> 1766.779
I mean it's still very much lacking in

1764.36 --> 1766.779
detail

1766.88 --> 1773.2990000000002
but let's just say siric is a god of

1770.6 --> 1775.399
betrayal and I intend to use him in that

1773.299 --> 1777.02
sense is that

1775.399 --> 1779.2399999999998
he doesn't like

1777.02 --> 1780.44
create an army and overtly attack is

1779.24 --> 1782.72
just that

1780.44 --> 1785.96
order becomes

1782.72 --> 1789.26
disrupted through sudden betrayal like

1785.96 --> 1792.74
people become possessed yeah and I even

1789.26 --> 1795.74
want to kind of I could mimic

1792.74 --> 1797.84
the psychological War situation that's

1795.74 --> 1799.039
now happening in the world to a certain

1797.84 --> 1803.1999999999998
extent

1799.039 --> 1803.2
but in the DND world

1803.6 --> 1810.039
as part of deity play I mean dude that's

1806.6 --> 1810.039
going to be killer

1811.279 --> 1816.26
cyric is the main opponent and he is

1813.559 --> 1819.1589999999999
like the god of betrayal

1816.26 --> 1819.1589999999999
is evil

1820.7 --> 1827.539
and he was bowel's arch nemesis

1824.299 --> 1831.22
or rival and he betrayed him right guess

1827.539 --> 1831.22
what yeah that's what Siri does

1832.399 --> 1837.3799999999999
so he's going to definitely end up being

1835.46 --> 1838.94
becoming the main opponent in this

1837.38 --> 1843.7600000000002
because it would

1838.94 --> 1843.76
give a dynamic that would actually allow

1844.279 --> 1849.44
more

1845.84 --> 1851.059
yeah more meaning for doing things as a

1849.44 --> 1853.76
deity in there

1851.059 --> 1855.98
like on a grander scale like there would

1853.76 --> 1858.919
be it wouldn't just be like oh you're

1855.98 --> 1860.84
walking around as a character

1858.919 --> 1862.88
or as an avatar basically with

1860.84 --> 1864.5
adventurers doing things that that

1862.88 --> 1866.179
wouldn't be the only thing you're gonna

1864.5 --> 1867.919
do there's also going to be like an

1866.179 --> 1870.14
overview map

1867.919 --> 1874.7
which is going to be like

1870.14 --> 1877.179
deity blessings influences like more a

1874.7 --> 1877.179
roughly

1878.779 --> 1885.26
like a long-term strategy settings like

1881.539 --> 1888.14
how what is your home plane gonna do

1885.26 --> 1891.34
how much power does it have like a bit

1888.14 --> 1891.3400000000001
of a strategy side

1891.559 --> 1894.1589999999999
to it

1894.86 --> 1899.12
that yeah

1896.48 --> 1901.3990000000001
in that sense it's kind of reminiscent

1899.12 --> 1904.539
to like the original Doom 2 game where

1901.399 --> 1904.539
you just have a big map

1905.24 --> 1909.08
then you have to go that's super basic I

1907.52 --> 1911.12
mean it's just like oh you click this

1909.08 --> 1912.559
and oh they attack that

1911.12 --> 1914.6589999999999
but

1912.559 --> 1917.0
that

1914.659 --> 1920.0590000000002
a more complex setting with much more

1917.0 --> 1923.299
meaning and Beauty do it

1920.059 --> 1926.72

2050.74 --> 2054.58
it's eight categorizations that don't

2310.48 --> 2314.46
it was all rainy yesterday

2317.44 --> 2321.42

2333.76 --> 2336.48
duh

2342.4 --> 2351.3
I mean it's it's the bricks the bricks

2347.02 --> 2351.3

2386.92 --> 2390.28
they were trying to broke her piece yeah

2388.72 --> 2393.3999999999996
but what do you think of that what

2390.28 --> 2396.099
happens if that fails

2393.4 --> 2400.56
it's interesting though that solensky is

2396.099 --> 2400.56
actually willing to even meet with China

2406.48 --> 2411.94
that probably means things are pretty

2408.76 --> 2415.3
serious right do you understand that

2411.94 --> 2417.4
because he's been unwilling to do any

2415.3 --> 2420.94
kind of Peace meetings

2417.4 --> 2423.1600000000003
with Russia so if he's then willing to

2420.94 --> 2424.9
do that with China well that means that

2423.16 --> 2426.16
China is going to get involved and it's

2424.9 --> 2429.48
basically gonna

2426.16 --> 2429.48
put an ultimatum

2431.56 --> 2437.5
yeah

2433.18 --> 2440.2799999999997

2494.94 --> 2502.48
yeah what could also be happening

2499.619 --> 2504.94

2502.48 --> 2507.96
though after everything has happened

2504.94 --> 2507.96
that would be crazy

2508.839 --> 2511.44
I mean

2511.92 --> 2515.52
they could be

2515.68 --> 2520.06
basically

2517.66 --> 2523.7799999999997
changing the whole thing up I mean if so

2520.06 --> 2525.7599999999998

there's something molten there

like that

it's all nonsense none of it is actually

thing that I copied somehow whatever

3303.66 --> 3307.46
yeah I'm posting your link

3310.099 --> 3316.4

3312.599 --> 3316.4
relevant to the guys over at fed

it's just gross

like half of the FED shows or something

3372.0 --> 3377.22
I'm out for groceries and then yeah I

3374.7 --> 3379.819
miss most of the live show

3377.22 --> 3379.819
so

3382.26 --> 3385.7400000000002
sometimes they're just not aware of

3384.3 --> 3390.92
what's going on

in the chat over at fvd sorry about that

3401.099 --> 3405.78
right but yeah it's ridiculous and I

3404.28 --> 3409.5
guess that's still happening out there

3405.78 --> 3414.7200000000003
it's just still

3409.5 --> 3419.839
figuring out also known as making up

3414.72 --> 3419.839
what the presupposed bow Earth score is

3422.94 --> 3430.4
and probably with it

3426.3 --> 3433.559
With a Purpose with a goal of trying to

3430.4 --> 3436.559
justify how it is supposedly causing

3433.559 --> 3436.559
magnetism

3439.26 --> 3443.76
here it's almost summer really

3444.9 --> 3450.9
and you trick no this is still like

3448.38 --> 3453.2400000000002
in between winter and spring

3450.9 --> 3456.8
it's getting a little better but it's

3453.24 --> 3456.7999999999997
not exactly spring just yet

3457.559 --> 3461.2400000000002
it still freezes at night

3462.839 --> 3465.92
Some Nights

3469.859 --> 3474.2999999999997
right and then in March there will be

3472.319 --> 3476.46
like the spring break moment

3474.3 --> 3478.7400000000002
or it's going to be kind of like a

3476.46 --> 3481.44
little bit of summer for a bit for like

3478.74 --> 3483.6189999999997
a week and then gets a bit colder again

3481.44 --> 3486.78
then usually the storm season happens

3483.619 --> 3489.26
for real with more hail and more actual

3486.78 --> 3489.26
storms

3491.72 --> 3496.2
and after that's done that's when the

3494.52 --> 3498.42
real spring starts

3496.2 --> 3500.9399999999996
and

3498.42 --> 3502.44
that can quickly turn into summer I mean

3500.94 --> 3505.14
some of the

3502.44 --> 3507.9
May Seasons here

3505.14 --> 3510.359
our full-blown summer

3507.9 --> 3512.96
but not all of them sometimes it can be

3510.359 --> 3512.96
kind of rainy

3517.26 --> 3519.7400000000002
anyway

3521.04 --> 3526.04
but a March is almost here

3526.74 --> 3532.5
I'm looking forward to the spring again

3530.28 --> 3534.8390000000004
and I feel that I did actually just

3532.5 --> 3539.299
survive the winter

3534.839 --> 3539.299
better than in previous times even

3544.5 --> 3549.14
creative inspiration is returning to me

3556.52 --> 3562.619
temperate zone climate

3559.92 --> 3566.599
for you it's cool yeah but that's

3562.619 --> 3566.599
because you're in India territory

3571.619 --> 3576.42

3573.839 --> 3578.099

3576.42 --> 3580.44
pure silver

3578.099 --> 3583.8590000000004

3613.079 --> 3616.079

3628.04 --> 3632.43
is there supposed to be more

3630.059 --> 3634.2000000000003

3632.43 --> 3636.859
[Music]

3634.2 --> 3636.859
obvious

3641.94 --> 3649.64
it's pure silver

3644.52 --> 3649.64
it's the Flower of Life I made it myself

3655.02 --> 3658.339
you figure it out

3658.5 --> 3661.46
ah

3662.819 --> 3666.14
pretty cool yeah thanks

3683.16 --> 3686.16

3703.04 --> 3709.14

3706.68 --> 3711.8999999999996
you may think the Netherlands is colder

3709.14 --> 3714.5589999999997
but I mean compare that to like Norway

3711.9 --> 3714.559
okay

3716.16 --> 3719.16
foreign

3721.92 --> 3726.66
oh well yeah that you could take it a

3724.319 --> 3729.72
step worse of course

3726.66 --> 3733.2799999999997
Go arctic but I mean

3729.72 --> 3733.2799999999997
think you probably wouldn't want to

3733.98 --> 3740.16
and really neither do I I'm not a huge

3737.579 --> 3742.94
fan of extremely cold

3740.16 --> 3742.94

3750.26 --> 3753.26
thank you

3756.839 --> 3762.02
45 degrees on this temperature here

3762.24 --> 3766.7
but how this ever been recorded was like

3766.98 --> 3772.4
I don't know I don't remember

3769.92 --> 3772.4
wait

3773.64 --> 3778.799

3778.799 --> 3784.92
that's extremely hot for a summer

3782.099 --> 3787.88
but I think it has been like that

3784.92 --> 3787.88
a couple of times

3788.04 --> 3792.42
but usually it's more it's like

3790.02 --> 3795.559
somewhere in the 20s and just really

3792.42 --> 3795.559
nice and warm and

3797.46 --> 3803.339
or rainy and still a bit warm

3801.119 --> 3806.359

I have to see it

3932.22 --> 3937.6189999999997
I mean I'm not like a florist minded

3934.799 --> 3939.859
person like that

3937.619 --> 3939.859
foreign

3957.38 --> 3963.619
I'm not a vegan woodworking gummy bear

3996.42 --> 4002.02
what are you doing

3998.64 --> 4002.02
you know I'm not a vegan

4004.039 --> 4011.9
I ate this sausage yesterday

4007.94 --> 4013.339
like with mashed potatoes and kale and

4011.9 --> 4016.119
butter

4013.339 --> 4016.119
I love it

4020.98 --> 4028.28
so yeah I'm not a vegan and I've never

4024.92 --> 4030.5
heard that the Flower of Life is the

4028.28 --> 4032.2400000000002
symbol for veganism like what the [ __ ]

4030.5 --> 4034.52
are you blabbering about

4032.24 --> 4036.4399999999996
where are you getting that from there's

4034.52 --> 4038.24
somebody on the internet saying that it

4036.44 --> 4042.2000000000003
is so

4038.24 --> 4043.8799999999997
they're claiming that how cute

4042.2 --> 4047.66
maybe they should go [ __ ] themselves

4043.88 --> 4050.059
because I am going to eat meat

4047.66 --> 4054.16
very picky about it

4050.059 --> 4054.1600000000003
I really only eat chicken and beef

4059.72 --> 4064.7599999999998
although yeah I mean

4061.88 --> 4066.7400000000002
I am not like oh prohibited to really

4064.76 --> 4069.619
take other things

4066.74 --> 4072.0389999999998
like I might eat wild deer or something

4069.619 --> 4072.039
or

4072.559 --> 4080.6600000000003
maybe try wild hog but I would never eat

4075.68 --> 4083.68
like an actual like Farm bread Pig

4080.66 --> 4083.68
I don't eat pork

4102.4 --> 4109.219
right and it takes fish oil of course

4107.179 --> 4113.08
I mean that's the thing I really need I

4109.219 --> 4113.08
don't like eating fish but I need it

4126.799 --> 4131.56
so where are you you're just joking

4132.739 --> 4135.459999999999
okay

4149.779 --> 4155.359
a good huge steamy traveler Seafood

4152.48 --> 4158.678999999999
freaks me the [ __ ] up

4155.359 --> 4158.679
like squid

4160.759 --> 4168.52
Lobster oh my God

4163.339 --> 4168.5199999999995
no thanks I mean I'll eat crab chips

4169.58 --> 4173.96
although yeah I still wonder sometimes

4172.279 --> 4176.540000000001
like

4173.96 --> 4179.179
are we not supposed to eat that or are

4176.54 --> 4181.64
we According To Jesus

4179.179 --> 4184.16
and what why why did you say that was it

4181.64 --> 4186.04
circumstantial was it Universal and I

4184.16 --> 4190.58
don't give a [ __ ] about some

4186.04 --> 4193.5199999999995
hermeneutical interpretation of all that

4190.58 --> 4195.679
I want a

4193.52 --> 4198.64
a more fresh

4195.679 --> 4198.64
perspective

4206.12 --> 4210.08
anyway

4207.4 --> 4212.48
across the station what the [ __ ] that

4210.08 --> 4213.8
sounds gross Cleary

4212.48 --> 4216.938999999999
what whatever

4213.8 --> 4216.939
[Music]

4222.5 --> 4226.94
Jesus liked fish

4225.02 --> 4229.64
yeah

4226.94 --> 4231.799999999999
but it all it could also be that the

4229.64 --> 4235.6
fish were relatively safe to eat

4231.8 --> 4235.6
compared to shellfish

4237.679 --> 4243.9800000000005
right shellfish are bottom dwellers

4241.94 --> 4246.94
if you have

4243.98 --> 4249.379999999999
industrial activity

4246.94 --> 4252.32
especially in the old days where they

4249.38 --> 4253.9400000000005
would just like use mercury

4252.32 --> 4255.92
the

4253.94 --> 4258.739
to like get gold and all that yeah

4255.92 --> 4260.2390000000005
you're gonna get runoff [ __ ] that's

4258.739 --> 4263.36
really toxic

4260.239 --> 4264.678999999999
and that's gonna like [ __ ] up especially

4263.36 --> 4267.44
the shellfish

4264.679 --> 4270.26
right so that's been like a thought of

4267.44 --> 4271.5199999999995
like is that why is that why Jesus said

4270.26 --> 4273.679
that

4271.52 --> 4275.4800000000005
because he didn't mind any fish but the

4273.679 --> 4277.76
shellfish he recommended again so is

4275.48 --> 4280.459999999999
that what it's about or is it really

4277.76 --> 4283.360000000001
like a a Divine thing

4280.46 --> 4283.36
not sure

4283.88 --> 4288.7390000000005
I mean I don't feel like really sinful

4286.64 --> 4290.96
when I eat crab chips

4288.739 --> 4293.36
but I still like there's a bit of

4290.96 --> 4295.159
tension there like there's contention I

4293.36 --> 4297.94
guess and it brings a little tension so

4295.159 --> 4297.94
I'm just not sure

4301.28 --> 4307.639999999999
huh yeah

4303.28 --> 4310.719
Carpenter Shepard fisherman Messiah

4307.64 --> 4310.719
I agree clearly

4314.3 --> 4319.46
fish is separate from meat yeah but I

4317.0 --> 4321.62
mean Thor KC in a way that is kind of

4319.46 --> 4323.179
correct I mean fish are pretty freaking

4321.62 --> 4324.86
weird man

4323.179 --> 4329.2390000000005
foreign

4324.86 --> 4331.58
I mean fish don't even have red blood a

4329.239 --> 4335.5
lot of them

4331.58 --> 4335.5
they have really weird creatures

4349.64 --> 4353.3
right and shellfish and insects are even

4352.04 --> 4355.9
weirder

4353.3 --> 4355.900000000001
anyway

4359.96 --> 4365.44
he didn't want people to eat it so no

4365.96 --> 4372.5
now Jesus would never just use a

4369.14 --> 4373.76
personal preference to make people stop

4372.5 --> 4377.62
doing that

4373.76 --> 4377.62
there would have been a logical reason

4381.58 --> 4387.0199999999995
otherwise he would have said I'm sorry I

4384.8 --> 4389.54
am kind of disgusted by that could you

4387.02 --> 4391.76
please not eat that air

4389.54 --> 4394.219
right you wouldn't just say oh this is

4391.76 --> 4396.14
bad I mean that's that's what a

4394.219 --> 4399.02
charlatan would say

4396.14 --> 4402.14
that that motivation Jesus I think was

4399.02 --> 4404.900000000001
definitely not a charlatan

4402.14 --> 4409.12
that's a really creepy thing to say

4404.9 --> 4409.12
actually or although infer

4409.52 --> 4413.7390000000005
not saying that you think that but I

4411.62 --> 4413.739
mean

4418.88 --> 4427.82
right so was Jesus Christ vegan and did

4422.9 --> 4430.04
he see that as part of the of being pure

4427.82 --> 4435.219
or was he just pragmatic and really

4430.04 --> 4435.219
Health focused which would make sense

4436.28 --> 4439.3
which one is it

4453.02 --> 4455.679
what

4456.219 --> 4460.94
are you mocking the Bible woodworking

4458.96 --> 4463.6
anywhere

4460.94 --> 4463.599999999999
wow

4480.08 --> 4485.12
Leviticus talks about childish

4482.659 --> 4487.599999999999
also was Leviticus now Jesus

4485.12 --> 4487.599999999999
okay

4498.44 --> 4505.159
um yeah chapter 15. yeah but you know

4502.52 --> 4508.34
that's not Jesus that's freaking Paul

4505.159 --> 4511.04
that's post I'm not interested in what

4508.34 --> 4515.08
the other Apostles think

4511.04 --> 4515.08
I'm interested in what Jesus

4515.179 --> 4518.4800000000005
thought

4516.32 --> 4520.699
which we can really only derive from

4518.48 --> 4523.459999999999
what he said

4520.699 --> 4525.678999999999
okay I don't care for what all the other

4523.46 --> 4529.159
nonsense that's come since that that

4525.679 --> 4534.52
literally just betrayed him

4529.159 --> 4534.5199999999995
by declaring him a freaking the God okay

4534.739 --> 4539.659
which he specifically on record

4537.34 --> 4542.0
instructed not to do it happens

4539.659 --> 4544.699
literally in the Bible

4542.0 --> 4547.94
so not you could say like he didn't only

4544.699 --> 4550.04
predict his crucifixion death and

4547.94 --> 4553.219
Resurrection or whatever he also

4550.04 --> 4556.34
predicted that he would become

4553.219 --> 4558.38
an idol that is Blasphemous and a

4556.34 --> 4560.4800000000005
counter opposite to who he actually

4558.38 --> 4563.62
served I mean that is what he

4560.48 --> 4563.62
effectively predicted

4566.36 --> 4573.44
and it's in the Bible all of it it's

4569.659 --> 4574.82
right there like don't I'm like it's my

4573.44 --> 4577.639999999999
father not me

4574.82 --> 4580.159
right paraphrasing perhaps slightly but

4577.64 --> 4582.8
it's very clearly all there

4580.159 --> 4586.58
Jesus said that

4582.8 --> 4589.06
and then other people they interpret oh

4586.58 --> 4591.44
no no but he didn't mean that it was

4589.06 --> 4593.179
fulfilling something

4591.44 --> 4595.639999999999
or whatever

4593.179 --> 4599.719
yeah that's

4595.64 --> 4602.1990000000005
Pauline Christianity what yeah is a lie

4599.719 --> 4602.199
exactly

4602.6 --> 4607.900000000001
it's a misdirection it's a challenge

4604.64 --> 4607.900000000001
within the very book

4607.94 --> 4610.659
foreign

4615.94 --> 4621.139999999999
what the [ __ ] you dude get the [ __ ] out

4618.679 --> 4623.9
of here since when did you become such a

4621.14 --> 4626.6
gamma [ __ ]

4623.9 --> 4630.82
get the [ __ ] up man

4626.6 --> 4630.820000000001
you are not a bear

4638.42 --> 4641.38
foreign

4653.98 --> 4659.678999999999
that name

4656.42 --> 4659.679
that kind of attitude

4666.56 --> 4671.360000000001
yeah what you trying to shame me for

4669.86 --> 4675.0199999999995
actually

4671.36 --> 4677.42
figuring out things about the Bible

4675.02 --> 4678.5
and having my own interpretation how

4677.42 --> 4681.8
dare you

4678.5 --> 4684.679
oh how dare you

4681.8 --> 4687.14
yeah thanks I'll be having and

4684.679 --> 4689.42
continuing my own interpretation thank

4687.14 --> 4692.179
you very much

4689.42 --> 4695.02
yeah as Christ in his own words

4692.179 --> 4695.02
instructed

4695.719 --> 4701.12
yeah you have to be your own priest

4698.06 --> 4702.8
don't look to a group

4701.12 --> 4706.04
priesthood

4702.8 --> 4708.56
or even another person

4706.04 --> 4710.179
reflect

4708.56 --> 4714.679
don't follow

4710.179 --> 4716.9
only follow God yeah I'm doing that

4714.679 --> 4720.26
I'm figuring it out

4716.9 --> 4722.54
figuring out what Jesus what really was

4720.26 --> 4724.34
what happened to him and how it's all

4722.54 --> 4726.08
right there in plain sight and people

4724.34 --> 4729.08
still Overlook it

4726.08 --> 4732.0199999999995
I mean the Bible is technically a

4729.08 --> 4735.14
massive psychological challenge

4732.02 --> 4737.42
and the majority of people never get

4735.14 --> 4740.4800000000005
never succeed

4737.42 --> 4745.06
they Overlook it all they get caught up

4740.48 --> 4745.0599999999995
in a certain polarized kind of position

4745.4 --> 4750.799999999999
they're fooled

4748.04 --> 4754.1
by Priestly interpretations and

4750.8 --> 4755.96
anticipations for that interpretation

4754.1 --> 4757.88
and they don't really get what's going

4755.96 --> 4760.12
on there

4757.88 --> 4763.46
the bigger picture

4760.12 --> 4766.42
contradictions in plain sight with how

4763.46 --> 4766.42
people interpret it

4770.25 --> 4773.78
[Music]

4771.5 --> 4776.92
people

4773.78 --> 4776.92
total ban

4778.94 --> 4786.0199999999995
he has been yeah but hey look Randy was

4782.9 --> 4788.36
a good chat member too yeah and then he

4786.02 --> 4790.76
suddenly became a total dick

4788.36 --> 4795.04
and a troll well that's not true he was

4790.76 --> 4795.04
always kind of a troll but no

4796.34 --> 4804.28
he's literally mocking like a gamma

4800.659 --> 4804.28
okay do I need to say it again

4804.38 --> 4809.179
I would however mock man's attempt to

4807.08 --> 4812.96
interpret it the Bible

4809.179 --> 4815.6
especially Dopey interpretations

4812.96 --> 4817.64
and then about his bacon

4815.6 --> 4819.7390000000005
yeah

4817.64 --> 4822.34
I don't want people that talk like that

4819.739 --> 4822.339999999999
around here

4822.92 --> 4827.6
it's contagious and it brings out other

4825.14 --> 4829.820000000001
Gammas that then think oh it's okay to

4827.6 --> 4833.8
be a piece of [ __ ] now yeah no it's not

4829.82 --> 4833.799999999999
okay it's not okay in this chat

4837.73 --> 4842.299999999999
[Music]

4840.199 --> 4844.58
yeah all right and when there's a big

4842.3 --> 4846.14
unbanning wave happening out in ban him

4844.58 --> 4848.0
again but I don't want to talk to him

4846.14 --> 4851.780000000001
right now I think he's probably caught

4848.0 --> 4854.78
up with the whole gymbop BS gamma

4851.78 --> 4854.78
explosion

4855.76 --> 4860.54
hangs around there a lot and he's

4858.199 --> 4863.86
probably been caught up in it and so now

4860.54 --> 4863.86
he is one of them

4879.38 --> 4884.26
he did say I not you what are you

4881.84 --> 4884.26
talking about

4894.92 --> 4897.64
foreign

4914.719 --> 4919.9
what

4916.179 --> 4919.9
I'm doing right now

4924.14 --> 4930.219
you want to leave him around

4927.38 --> 4930.219
really

4937.04 --> 4940.42
he's acting like a troll

4943.219 --> 4948.9800000000005
this is not a oh I just immediately

4945.679 --> 4953.179
banned him for one bad mouth situation

4948.98 --> 4955.099999999999
he's been talking kind of shitty

4953.179 --> 4957.82
and dressed him back and forth and it

4955.1 --> 4957.820000000001
got worse

4958.46 --> 4963.5
Are you seriously saying oh no I mean

4961.159 --> 4964.82
let's just let people talk complete [ __ ]

4963.5 --> 4968.26
in my chat

4964.82 --> 4968.259999999999
without any respect

4983.06 --> 4987.679
or or do you agree with him you think

4985.28 --> 4990.08
that saying oh this is Dopey

4987.679 --> 4991.9400000000005
interpretations you think that that's

4990.08 --> 4994.58
that that's cool you think my

4991.94 --> 4996.139999999999
interpretations are Dopey Cleary

4994.58 --> 4998.78
steamy Traveler

4996.14 --> 5001.26
think that's normal to say something

4998.78 --> 5001.259999999999
like that

5013.659 --> 5018.12
no right so there you go

5020.44 --> 5025.98
no you're not gonna get banned steamy

5022.719 --> 5025.9800000000005
traveler don't be such a

5027.04 --> 5032.199
don't

5028.719 --> 5034.44
Don't Be Afraid like what the [ __ ] is

5032.199 --> 5034.44
this

5041.92 --> 5046.86
right you're not gonna give me a gamma

5044.199 --> 5046.86
rant right

5048.04 --> 5053.92
that now I'm all stupid because there's

5050.02 --> 5055.540000000001
something you disagree with about

5053.92 --> 5057.6990000000005
instead of actually like oh

5055.54 --> 5061.5
participating sharing your view right

5057.699 --> 5061.5
which I definitely allow

5062.56 --> 5066.84
you guys do realize that right

5090.58 --> 5093.179
okay

5097.0 --> 5099.659
all right

5100.42 --> 5104.8
19 watching fine

5111.58 --> 5118.14
right anyway I do appreciate those that

5114.1 --> 5118.14
have actually given me feedback here

5119.98 --> 5125.5599999999995
to be more precise as to like a whole

5123.28 --> 5129.659
shellfish [ __ ] situation apparently

5125.56 --> 5129.659000000001
Jesus himself did not say it

5130.0 --> 5132.3
foreign

5136.239 --> 5141.099999999999
or am I now misinterpreting what you

5138.76 --> 5143.26
guys said I don't know it's hard to tell

5141.1 --> 5146.64
when just

5143.26 --> 5146.64
people don't really talk

5149.14 --> 5153.6
not

5150.1 --> 5153.6
picking up what we're talking about

5162.699 --> 5164.879999999999
thank you

5175.239 --> 5180.459999999999
yeah sorry Casey because

5178.36 --> 5183.28
the guys like in

5180.46 --> 5186.1
I mean he was just joking I was just

5183.28 --> 5188.259999999999
joking I'm a vegan oh so he continued

5186.1 --> 5190.900000000001
that joke well he knows I'm not a vegan

5188.26 --> 5194.08
I don't like people

5190.9 --> 5196.42
Miss portraying me especially in my own

5194.08 --> 5200.0199999999995
chat

5196.42 --> 5202.179
I don't eat bacon I don't like it I

5200.02 --> 5204.76
don't think it's healthy for me

5202.179 --> 5207.36
I avoid it for that reason for health

5204.76 --> 5207.360000000001
reasons

5207.52 --> 5215.280000000001
yeah I'm not a freaking vegan it's just

5210.4 --> 5215.28
making up all that [ __ ] being nasty

5215.8 --> 5220.900000000001
I mean I don't see why you guys don't

5217.9 --> 5222.5199999999995
see that from the start I saw as there's

5220.9 --> 5224.5599999999995
something wrong with him the way he's

5222.52 --> 5226.6
just talking

5224.56 --> 5228.219
it's been like that before so something

5226.6 --> 5230.320000000001
happened

5228.219 --> 5231.4
I think it probably has to do with the

5230.32 --> 5234.46
whole

5231.4 --> 5238.299999999999
gym Bob situation because he did hang

5234.46 --> 5242.199
around there we did chat there

5238.3 --> 5244.360000000001
but he was also well mucking around a

5242.199 --> 5245.678999999999
bit at times like he thought it was

5244.36 --> 5247.42
funny

5245.679 --> 5249.4
to call me a vegan and I didn't

5247.42 --> 5251.82
appreciate it didn't appreciate it a

5249.4 --> 5251.82
single time

5261.639 --> 5264.54
foreign

5270.219 --> 5274.84
so yeah division in the lands on more

5272.8 --> 5277.6
division

5274.84 --> 5280.2390000000005
and people are just going off polarizing

5277.6 --> 5282.46
and getting into fights and

5280.239 --> 5286.12
[ __ ] off

5282.46 --> 5288.9
and maybe they'll come back someday

5286.12 --> 5288.9
or maybe not

5293.739 --> 5298.178999999999
but yeah I mean I don't think it's gonna

5295.84 --> 5299.860000000001
end well for Jim Bob I did predict that

5298.179 --> 5303.1
by the way

5299.86 --> 5305.08
even even still went home Benjamin was

5303.1 --> 5308.56
still being kind of protective I already

5305.08 --> 5311.08
said like no this is [ __ ]

5308.56 --> 5313.92
made a very clear statement in a very

5311.08 --> 5313.92
specific timing

5314.02 --> 5319.42
then yeah I mean it's it's going it's

5317.08 --> 5321.719
going down it's a drama I mean it's not

5319.42 --> 5321.719
good

5326.679 --> 5330.12
Jim Bob is not

5330.76 --> 5336.6990000000005
who he seem to be acting like and now

5334.179 --> 5339.1
he's showing that side of him and that's

5336.699 --> 5341.259999999999
not gonna end well

5339.1 --> 5343.360000000001
because she can't just put the mask back

5341.26 --> 5345.34
on

5343.36 --> 5348.04
CE you let that go

5345.34 --> 5350.82
there's no putting the genie back in the

5348.04 --> 5350.82
bottle basically

5353.76 --> 5358.2390000000005
because people know that now they know

5356.38 --> 5361.36
you they have you have that in that in

5358.239 --> 5365.159
you and so you can't make fun of those

5361.36 --> 5368.38
traits anymore because you

5365.159 --> 5370.54
violated the spiritual agreement to not

5368.38 --> 5372.76
do that in order to be able to make fun

5370.54 --> 5374.62
of it

5372.76 --> 5376.659000000001
yeah you can't make fun of Hypocrites

5374.62 --> 5378.76
when you're a hypocrite

5376.659 --> 5381.82
can't make fun of people

5378.76 --> 5384.76
for being illogical and delusional when

5381.82 --> 5385.98
you yourself are provably illogical and

5384.76 --> 5390.84
delusional

5385.98 --> 5390.839999999999
doesn't work like that it won't be fun

5391.3 --> 5396.04
this is being extremely foolish and

5393.52 --> 5399.040000000001
headstrong about this and he's gonna

5396.04 --> 5403.42
snap out of it very badly with a lot of

5399.04 --> 5405.659
loss that are not restorable

5403.42 --> 5405.659
foreign

5410.159 --> 5414.94
after this

5412.0 --> 5418.0
sorry this that's how it works it's not

5414.94 --> 5421.0599999999995
me declaring or putting a Spell on You

5418.0 --> 5423.6
as a dark magician no this is just how

5421.06 --> 5423.6
it works

5423.94 --> 5430.599999999999
you've done it to yourself and you're

5425.679 --> 5433.06
locking yourself into this attitude

5430.6 --> 5435.9400000000005
while in the real world

5433.06 --> 5437.4400000000005
everybody sees it for what it is like it

5435.94 --> 5439.839999999999
doesn't matter that you will see it

5437.44 --> 5442.719
differently everybody else sees it for

5439.84 --> 5446.38
what's really happening

5442.719 --> 5448.3
you can avoid your consciousness of that

5446.38 --> 5450.6990000000005
to get around

5448.3 --> 5453.6990000000005
but if you then just go off

5450.699 --> 5455.919999999999
continually and guard gamma ranting then

5453.699 --> 5460.98
that will

5455.92 --> 5460.9800000000005
like set into your spirit

5461.199 --> 5467.379999999999
and then people will just see that

5464.44 --> 5468.58
only that all the other things that were

5467.38 --> 5471.219
fun

5468.58 --> 5476.26
and funny and hilarious and and

5471.219 --> 5477.78
interesting well be all clouded by that

5476.26 --> 5482.4400000000005
by that

5477.78 --> 5484.78
unrelenting gamma-spastic Behavior

5482.44 --> 5486.879999999999
that's how it works right

5484.78 --> 5488.44
I mean I have to be very careful with my

5486.88 --> 5492.52
rage win too

5488.44 --> 5493.659
like because that too clouds how people

5492.52 --> 5496.360000000001
see me

5493.659 --> 5498.879999999999
in a way

5496.36 --> 5500.86
so it's not raging to me it's not like

5498.88 --> 5502.54
oh that's just the time where I explode

5500.86 --> 5506.139
and I throw everything out because then

5502.54 --> 5509.44
I basically end up very similar to Jim

5506.139 --> 5511.0
Bob or more emotional or hysterical it

5509.44 --> 5513.28
would not be good it would just make me

5511.0 --> 5514.36
seem extremely unstable so now when it

5513.28 --> 5517.36
happens

5514.36 --> 5520.48
I make heavy effort

5517.36 --> 5522.48
to actually Channel it into a more

5520.48 --> 5525.459999999999
constructive frequency

5522.48 --> 5528.218999999999
as it's happening

5525.46 --> 5529.78
to have a plan on what to do when it

5528.219 --> 5532.06
happens

5529.78 --> 5535.179
that is completely compartmentalized

5532.06 --> 5537.1
from my regular more regular states of

5535.179 --> 5539.4400000000005
mind

5537.1 --> 5541.3
to turn it to basically shape it

5539.44 --> 5544.299999999999
creatively as it happens instead of just

5541.3 --> 5547.1990000000005
letting it grow wild and polluting right

5544.3 --> 5547.1990000000005
anyway

5548.02 --> 5553.959000000001
welcome back OSG

5550.72 --> 5553.959
[Music]

5564.69 --> 5567.759999999999
[Music]

5565.9 --> 5570.28
right

5567.76 --> 5572.320000000001
now of course for the record yeah meet

5570.28 --> 5575.139
me Banning gunny bear here

5572.32 --> 5577.84
it's because of the very unique position

5575.139 --> 5581.32
that I have her as a channel owner

5577.84 --> 5585.219
and as the show host

5581.32 --> 5587.5599999999995
if I were were to have like a wrench

5585.219 --> 5589.659
in another chat

5587.56 --> 5590.9800000000005
and woodworking gummy bear would say

5589.659 --> 5593.0199999999995
that to me

5590.98 --> 5595.959999999999
then I wouldn't

5593.02 --> 5597.9400000000005
like time him out even or ban him

5595.96 --> 5602.04
especially I wouldn't do that you see

5597.94 --> 5602.04
because it's not my place

5602.44 --> 5606.28
because

5603.58 --> 5609.58
he might have an opinion

5606.28 --> 5611.139
and I'm really just a moderator

5609.58 --> 5613.84
I mean if he's gonna go really

5611.139 --> 5614.92
disgusting or whatever like really try

5613.84 --> 5616.659000000001
to

5614.92 --> 5619.9
gross me out

5616.659 --> 5621.759999999999
or get super offensive yeah then I'll

5619.9 --> 5624.46
kick him

5621.76 --> 5626.7390000000005
but I mean not for what he just said

5624.46 --> 5629.08
that's just oh he's in the shitty mood

5626.739 --> 5634.36
I'm just not gonna talk to him

5629.08 --> 5636.46
but because this is my chat my show I do

5634.36 --> 5640.92
definitely get hard

5636.46 --> 5640.92
if people start to mock me in my chat

5643.92 --> 5649.96
Jim Bob says Owen doesn't do anything

5646.44 --> 5652.299999999999
Jim Buffs has a lot of delusional things

5649.96 --> 5655.62
currently I think I don't know because I

5652.3 --> 5655.62
haven't watched any of his streams

5656.38 --> 5662.26
since the stream after that one stream

5659.92 --> 5665.139
after yeah the show they did together

5662.26 --> 5668.02
that's the show after that when he

5665.139 --> 5670.12
started to basically try to justify

5668.02 --> 5671.860000000001
everything that's the last stream I

5670.12 --> 5676.54
watched after that it's just it was so

5671.86 --> 5679.12
ruined he literally threatened to ban me

5676.54 --> 5681.4
oh wait I did go back like another

5679.12 --> 5684.03
stream for a bit

5681.4 --> 5685.12
but it's just I don't feel

5684.03 --> 5687.5199999999995
[Music]

5685.12 --> 5689.38
like I feel like if I now am honest and

5687.52 --> 5691.659000000001
saying things I could probably get

5689.38 --> 5693.400000000001
kicked out

5691.659 --> 5696.099999999999
so it's just not the same place anymore

5693.4 --> 5699.28
I'm not free to say what's on my mind

5696.1 --> 5702.84
there any longer

5699.28 --> 5702.84
so I don't really watch it

5703.239 --> 5708.339999999999
I'm getting like secondhand information

5705.4 --> 5711.099999999999
through Owen Benjamin

5708.34 --> 5712.54
about what it's like and that's good

5711.1 --> 5716.26
enough for me because I don't want to

5712.54 --> 5719.44
watch kimbap act like a complete gamma

5716.26 --> 5722.38
spaz I don't want to see it it's very

5719.44 --> 5725.638999999999
embarrassing and disappointing

5722.38 --> 5725.639
and aggravating

5745.12 --> 5748.139
all right

5759.58 --> 5764.159
all right anyway it's ridiculous

5764.56 --> 5769.780000000001
oh and Benjamin definitely does a lot of

5767.56 --> 5772.92
farm work

5769.78 --> 5772.92
pretty sure he does

5784.84 --> 5789.400000000001
globe

5787.36 --> 5793.259999999999
backwards

5789.4 --> 5793.259999999999
Bay look yeah but it isn't though

5794.98 --> 5800.98
it would be ableg e-book glow backwards

5799.36 --> 5804.179
is not Bay log

5800.98 --> 5804.178999999999
don't know where you're getting that

5804.58 --> 5807.58
foreign

5815.98 --> 5823.62
in German is not literally glow they

5820.54 --> 5823.62
have another word for it

5828.4 --> 5835.32
although the other word

5831.04 --> 5835.32
is ball well yeah

5836.739 --> 5843.419999999999
but Globe is very English we have ball

5843.699 --> 5846.719
or sphere

5848.44 --> 5852.638999999999
but we don't have globe

5851.02 --> 5855.42
as a word

5852.639 --> 5855.42
that's English

5855.46 --> 5858.96
that's kind of unique to English

5862.0 --> 5866.199
Jesus

5863.34 --> 5868.42
37 of the [ __ ]

5866.199 --> 5870.759999999999
is it true I don't know I'm not like

5868.42 --> 5873.159
keeping super close tabs or anything

5870.76 --> 5876.659000000001
turret but could be

5873.159 --> 5878.98
man that's crazy

5876.659 --> 5880.659
Globus in German what are you getting

5878.98 --> 5884.7
that from

5880.659 --> 5887.7789999999995
I don't think so let me test it

5884.7 --> 5887.7789999999995
[Music]

5888.4 --> 5890.879999999999
oh

5891.76 --> 5896.139
okay I guess they do have a word for

5894.1 --> 5899.46
that I've never actually heard a German

5896.139 --> 5899.46
person ever say that

5899.8 --> 5908.58
I get yeah in Dutch there is a word

5903.04 --> 5908.58
Globe 2 Globe but that's like

5908.98 --> 5914.44
nobody ever uses that internet nobody

5911.86 --> 5916.48
ever calls it a globe

5914.44 --> 5919.379999999999
we say ball

5916.48 --> 5919.379999999999
of sphere

5920.139 --> 5924.88
so

5921.34 --> 5928.06
but I guess there is a word for it

5924.88 --> 5929.9800000000005
huh never realized that

5928.06 --> 5932.139
never thought of that because it had

5929.98 --> 5933.459999999999
hurt like older teachers and all that

5932.139 --> 5935.9800000000005
use the word

5933.46 --> 5938.82
Clover I would start it was like that

5935.98 --> 5938.82
sounds so awkward

5940.54 --> 5947.26
weird old-fashioned awkward

5943.84 --> 5950.58
I in the newer times I've never heard

5947.26 --> 5950.58
anybody use that word

5966.159 --> 5969.82
right but yeah Gemini Luna you're

5968.8 --> 5974.46
correct

5969.82 --> 5974.46
there was a word for it hmm

5983.739 --> 5988.419999999999
but yeah the Dutch version and a we're

5986.38 --> 5991.4800000000005
neighbors of German and there's a lot of

5988.42 --> 5995.4400000000005
similarities in many ways that well

5991.48 --> 5997.78
Dutch people can spot easily

5995.44 --> 5999.879999999999
Americans and all that probably can't

5997.78 --> 6002.78
spot it as easily

5999.88 --> 6002.78
or even English

6003.12 --> 6010.8
but yeah we don't use the word globe

6006.96 --> 6012.96
typically like that's nobody uses that

6010.8 --> 6016.02
word in the Netherlands

6012.96 --> 6018.42
except for like Old Sock

6016.02 --> 6022.02
people like

6018.42 --> 6023.219
just weird Old Sock people

6022.02 --> 6024.540000000001
I don't know if they're even around

6023.219 --> 6027.179
anymore

6024.54 --> 6030.179
but like from the 80s some people would

6027.179 --> 6033.56
have said that but nowadays nobody uses

6030.179 --> 6037.9400000000005
that word the Dutch version of it

6033.56 --> 6037.9400000000005
Globe it just sounds weird

6045.12 --> 6047.659
oh

6047.88 --> 6050.659000000001
the [ __ ]

6052.5 --> 6056.96
Jesus

6054.0 --> 6056.96
where is it though

6062.04 --> 6064.639
bro

6077.82 --> 6080.82
foreign

6084.98 --> 6090.5
there's gonna be like almost an exodus

6087.78 --> 6090.5
of Turks

6091.739 --> 6095.299999999999
I guess where they're gonna go

6103.26 --> 6107.2390000000005
like that doesn't bode well

6108.3 --> 6113.119000000001
it's this natural no doesn't sound

6110.34 --> 6113.119000000001
natural at all

6117.06 --> 6120.84
but it already didn't sound natural

6118.92 --> 6122.76
before when there was like this

6120.84 --> 6124.92
earthquake that is like in a straight

6122.76 --> 6127.5
line

6124.92 --> 6129.719
and it doesn't happen like that so yeah

6127.5 --> 6131.58
but apparently if it keeps going that's

6129.719 --> 6133.86
definitely not natural

6131.58 --> 6136.8
earthquakes don't just keep on going and

6133.86 --> 6140.0599999999995
going and going like that

6136.8 --> 6140.06
with that kind of force

6147.06 --> 6154.34
a new plate boundary is for what

6151.8 --> 6154.34
really

6168.9 --> 6172.739
it's uh this is a glober though this

6171.78 --> 6175.679
channel

6172.739 --> 6177.78
very very obviously I hope you realize

6175.679 --> 6180.3
that

6177.78 --> 6182.719
right so maybe they have a new narrative

6180.3 --> 6182.719
for that

6189.36 --> 6195.48
we'll see

6191.34 --> 6198.4800000000005
look I don't even fully understand like

6195.48 --> 6201.119
how what is now called plate tectonics

6198.48 --> 6203.36
actually works in reality because that

6201.119 --> 6205.98
is all resting on a lot of

6203.36 --> 6208.619
presuppositions and it's

6205.98 --> 6212.099999999999
in its conception but there does seem to

6208.619 --> 6214.46
be what I call segments segments of the

6212.1 --> 6214.46
realm

6214.679 --> 6219.96
I don't know why though like what that

6217.619 --> 6221.88
really is but

6219.96 --> 6225.619
there is apparently divisions in the

6221.88 --> 6225.619
earth and they do kind of like move

6227.04 --> 6233.639
there's tension on things like that so

6229.86 --> 6236.159
but what they are like is that

6233.639 --> 6238.02
is it really like plates and no they're

6236.159 --> 6239.4
bumping into each other like they say in

6238.02 --> 6241.619000000001
the graphs like that I think that's

6239.4 --> 6243.299999999999
complete nonsense but what it could be

6241.619 --> 6248.48
maybe is like

6243.3 --> 6248.4800000000005
they're like stems almost

6248.52 --> 6255.42
like stems of a of a bark or something

6251.96 --> 6257.639
of wood and yeah like what if it was

6255.42 --> 6260.58
like segments of wood that are just

6257.639 --> 6263.58
colossal and they're like

6260.58 --> 6265.8
a bit mobile so that it would be like

6263.58 --> 6267.3
yeah stems all the way down

6265.8 --> 6270.179
and they're like

6267.3 --> 6272.159000000001
kind of separately movable like that's

6270.179 --> 6274.08
yeah stems like this they're just

6272.159 --> 6276.659
separately movable and that

6274.08 --> 6279.179
maybe that is what it is I think that it

6276.659 --> 6280.679
could be something like that

6279.179 --> 6283.02
I don't know

6280.679 --> 6287.46
it's definitely not like

6283.02 --> 6290.3
plates floating on some magma or

6287.46 --> 6290.3
whatever they think

6291.239 --> 6294.5599999999995
that doesn't make any sense

6297.96 --> 6302.159
I think magma is mostly like locally

6300.36 --> 6305.28
created

6302.159 --> 6308.339999999999
or formed might be purely natural might

6305.28 --> 6310.679
be something weirder happening part of

6308.34 --> 6313.38
the realm design

6310.679 --> 6315.719
but yeah it's not floating on magma

6313.38 --> 6318.78
that's for sure so it might be just like

6315.719 --> 6321.84
stem like stems from a plant segments

6318.78 --> 6323.219
that are separate pillars that are

6321.84 --> 6325.02
separately

6323.219 --> 6327.4800000000005
moving and having friction with one

6325.02 --> 6331.400000000001
another so it could be that that's what

6327.48 --> 6331.4
I've been speculating recently

6332.219 --> 6338.6
to work Under Pressure turns mold them

6335.159 --> 6338.599999999999
well it has to be a lot of pressure

6349.92 --> 6357.56
right and whatever's going on that there

6353.4 --> 6357.5599999999995
is no magma everywhere down there

6362.94 --> 6365.659
foreign

6370.28 --> 6375.599999999999
it wouldn't make any sense if there were

6372.84 --> 6378.139
you see

6375.6 --> 6378.139
like

6379.199 --> 6383.48
there are things that are just really

6381.119 --> 6383.48
old

6392.28 --> 6397.619
I mean there's rock out there that is

6394.98 --> 6400.44
like incredibly old

6397.619 --> 6402.96
like that doesn't make sense if that all

6400.44 --> 6405.78
came out of lava like there's there's

6402.96 --> 6408.96
only so much you can actually create

6405.78 --> 6410.82
with lava under conditions right there's

6408.96 --> 6413.58
rock out there that could never have

6410.82 --> 6417.92
been lava

6413.58 --> 6417.92
or Molten in any way

6418.679 --> 6423.6
like rock with polonium rings in them

6421.02 --> 6427.5
right there's no way that could have

6423.6 --> 6431.84
ever been eaten it was always there so

6427.5 --> 6436.199
it can be molten down there

6431.84 --> 6437.88
that might like solidify as it goes up

6436.199 --> 6440.159
the surface because

6437.88 --> 6443.06
makes no sense

6440.159 --> 6443.0599999999995
mechanically

6444.36 --> 6449.659
yeah doesn't matter if things have

6446.58 --> 6449.659
melting points

6450.0 --> 6457.1
there is rock that has never been molted

6452.699 --> 6457.099999999999
melted it's just not possible

6462.239 --> 6467.5199999999995
in that setup

6464.04 --> 6469.739
in that Assumption of the cosmogeny that

6467.52 --> 6472.080000000001
there is rock that has never been malted

6469.739 --> 6475.0199999999995
and that's just a fact so you can't say

6472.08 --> 6479.42
it all came out of molten stuff

6475.02 --> 6479.42
to the surface like no it makes no sense

6483.56 --> 6488.2390000000005
Rock evaporates what

6489.0 --> 6494.78
uh

6491.76 --> 6494.780000000001
not literally

6498.239 --> 6503.82
I mean if you extremely heat it I mean

6501.42 --> 6507.86
yeah you can like make it white hot and

6503.82 --> 6507.86
then eventually it will evaporate but

6508.199 --> 6512.599999999999
and you have erosion also yeah

6512.88 --> 6517.4400000000005
the point is it cannot be all molten

6515.58 --> 6521.46
down there and that we're like slowly

6517.44 --> 6523.199
grinding downwards over the Millennia or

6521.46 --> 6526.5
however long

6523.199 --> 6529.138999999999
right and that's like oh well you're

6526.5 --> 6532.139
getting closer downwards so that means

6529.139 --> 6535.04
that more lava or whatever under there

6532.139 --> 6537.139
is going to solidify it makes no sense

6535.04 --> 6538.86
there's been

6537.139 --> 6545.76
rocks

6538.86 --> 6550.159
I have never ever been Molten

6545.76 --> 6550.159000000001
so it cannot be that

6568.56 --> 6573.360000000001
they can predict yeah

6571.139 --> 6575.219
I know

6573.36 --> 6577.82
there are certain things that you can

6575.219 --> 6577.82
figure out

6578.04 --> 6583.44
it's very interesting up to a certain

6581.159 --> 6585.9
depth right after certain depth doesn't

6583.44 --> 6587.58
work anymore at all

6585.9 --> 6591.739
but yeah on the surface there's

6587.58 --> 6591.739
information you can derive certainly

6601.56 --> 6608.04
what you can't do however is

6604.86 --> 6611.4
scan deeper and deeper and deeper and

6608.04 --> 6615.119
then find oh [ __ ] we've just reached

6611.4 --> 6616.92
a place where it's liquid

6615.119 --> 6619.08
the signals we're getting back means

6616.92 --> 6622.679
it's liquid no no that doesn't exist

6619.08 --> 6626.84
that might happen when you're like doing

6622.679 --> 6626.84
it near a volcanic area or whatever

6627.119 --> 6633.179
but other than that

6629.82 --> 6634.98
in non-volcanic area you don't have that

6633.179 --> 6637.619
you don't come across that you can't

6634.98 --> 6638.638999999999
just poke a hole through this apparent

6637.619 --> 6642.179
plate

6638.639 --> 6643.86
and then have volcanoes basically form

6642.179 --> 6646.9400000000005
there because you poke the hole through

6643.86 --> 6646.94
it doesn't exist

6655.08 --> 6659.76
I mean

6657.239 --> 6663.599999999999
when there's like fissures happening

6659.76 --> 6666.54
right Rocco is a park

6663.6 --> 6670.26
does lava come out

6666.54 --> 6671.58
or does that only happen in fantasy

6670.26 --> 6672.54
movies

6671.58 --> 6674.639
foreign

6672.54 --> 6677.159
magic and all that

6674.639 --> 6680.88
right is there any record of ever a

6677.159 --> 6684.5599999999995
Fisher in Earth opening somewhere

6680.88 --> 6684.56
and lava coming out

6686.699 --> 6689.78
I don't think so

6702.96 --> 6706.4
pretty yeah I know

6706.679 --> 6712.26
so there is no evidence that there that

6708.96 --> 6715.199
it's all resting on some kind of lava or

6712.26 --> 6717.360000000001
molten rock there's no evidence for it

6715.199 --> 6720.299999999999
at all then is real

6717.36 --> 6723.36
because there is Rock

6720.3 --> 6724.860000000001
that has never been Molten

6723.36 --> 6727.259999999999
so that

6724.86 --> 6730.739
like immediately contradicts the entire

6727.26 --> 6732.96
notion but also it's never actually been

6730.739 --> 6735.0
scanned you've never been to a place

6732.96 --> 6738.3
that isn't

6735.0 --> 6741.0
where there's a fault line or volcano

6738.3 --> 6743.400000000001
where you could go deep enough and then

6741.0 --> 6746.28
actually prove like wow it is actually

6743.4 --> 6752.5199999999995
resting on this molten layer

6746.28 --> 6752.5199999999995
there's no evidence for that whatsoever

6753.06 --> 6759.3
making it very much possible for my

6756.0 --> 6762.86
model of not plates

6759.3 --> 6766.56
floating but stems

6762.86 --> 6770.28
big rock pillars you could say

6766.56 --> 6772.56
that have separations between them and

6770.28 --> 6776.34
they can move like independently and

6772.56 --> 6778.320000000001
might that might be involved with what

6776.34 --> 6780.84
causes earthquakes

6778.32 --> 6784.679
as an alternative to oh they're crashing

6780.84 --> 6787.02
into each other and like that no no

6784.679 --> 6789.9
much deeper much more fundamental which

6787.02 --> 6792.4800000000005
would always mean that yeah earthquakes

6789.9 --> 6795.719
are always going to be in the same

6792.48 --> 6798.718999999999
locations because that's

6795.719 --> 6801.119
where the stems are separated

6798.719 --> 6803.58
so it might move around a little but

6801.119 --> 6806.219
it's always going to be at the spot

6803.58 --> 6811.5199999999995
where the stems are separated

6806.219 --> 6811.52
right so that's my alternative model

6812.58 --> 6816.32
that's what I think about it right now

6827.79 --> 6830.88
[Music]

6831.119 --> 6835.92
anyway

6832.679 --> 6838.4400000000005
man time has flown though most of them

6835.92 --> 6840.119
are gonna round out the show

6838.44 --> 6841.919999999999
although it's getting a bit interesting

6840.119 --> 6843.54
huh

6841.92 --> 6845.6990000000005
maybe I'll hang around a bit longer I'm

6843.54 --> 6849.679
gonna go to toilet

6845.699 --> 6849.678999999999
and be right back

6914.04 --> 6917.0
foreign

6945.78 --> 6948.5
foreign

6961.0 --> 6964.069
[Music]

6967.88 --> 6972.3
yeah but you're just presupposing it's a

6970.679 --> 6974.6990000000005
fault line

6972.3 --> 6976.7390000000005
in the sense that you're presupposing

6974.699 --> 6979.759999999999
it's a plate

6976.739 --> 6979.759999999999
there's no proof

6991.44 --> 6997.32
how did the scientists gain confidence

6994.08 --> 6998.04
for a solid metal ball layer as the

6997.32 --> 7000.86
Earth

6998.04 --> 7003.86
they didn't it's all theorizing it's

7000.86 --> 7007.82
like astrophysics except it's basically

7003.86 --> 7010.5199999999995
terrestrial physics like that it's like

7007.82 --> 7013.099999999999
they're just speculating and like how

7010.52 --> 7015.52
could it be and have been at it for a

7013.1 --> 7015.52
while now

7015.86 --> 7021.099999999999
right I mean the story is continually

7017.96 --> 7024.02
changing because they don't [ __ ] know

7021.1 --> 7026.780000000001
they're just making it up they're just

7024.02 --> 7030.76
trying to figure out what could it be in

7026.78 --> 7030.759999999999
order to fit whatever we want it to be

7032.42 --> 7035.679
aerial photos

7035.84 --> 7039.400000000001
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

7056.96 --> 7063.699
and Jude what what are you talking about

7060.38 --> 7063.6990000000005
then Israel

7082.82 --> 7085.0
foreign

7095.02 --> 7098.9800000000005
you didn't add much

7101.36 --> 7106.4
you just Spam some other spam you just

7104.54 --> 7107.599
said like oh it's a smaller just get the

7106.4 --> 7110.719
comp

7107.599 --> 7113.619000000001
blah blah blah you didn't say anything

7110.719 --> 7113.619
real

7127.34 --> 7132.52
you're talking about aerial photos of

7130.219 --> 7132.52
what

7133.94 --> 7141.259999999999
don't believe in magma what

7137.54 --> 7143.9
why do you even don't believe in magma I

7141.26 --> 7147.76
didn't say magma doesn't exist you dummy

7143.9 --> 7147.759999999999
what the hell are you talking about

7147.86 --> 7154.28
fault lines bro yeah I know bro I know

7150.92 --> 7158.06
lava does exist it's just not what the

7154.28 --> 7160.84
Earth crust that you presuppose is

7158.06 --> 7160.84
floating on

7162.86 --> 7168.44
it's only at these separations the

7166.159 --> 7170.54
segment separations where they are

7168.44 --> 7173.419999999999
crushing

7170.54 --> 7175.699
and creating friction or something else

7173.42 --> 7176.84
in those locations that's actually

7175.699 --> 7182.259999999999
causing

7176.84 --> 7182.26
magma to form it's only in those places

7184.28 --> 7188.599
yeah I never said magma doesn't exist

7187.04 --> 7191.26
like where the hell did you get that

7188.599 --> 7191.26
idea from

7196.4 --> 7200.0
that's because magma is beneath it no

7198.56 --> 7203.96
that's because

7200.0 --> 7208.76
it's in between it it's there it's where

7203.96 --> 7211.76
the segments are having friction yeah

7208.76 --> 7214.2390000000005
that's where then magma starts to form

7211.76 --> 7214.2390000000005
in between

7214.76 --> 7220.58
and that gets pressurized locally

7217.699 --> 7223.759999999999
because it's not there if it would be

7220.58 --> 7226.699
all the way through to the molten core

7223.76 --> 7228.8
or whatever yeah it wouldn't even build

7226.699 --> 7231.879999999999
that pressure it would just equalize the

7228.8 --> 7231.88
pressure with everything else

7232.54 --> 7238.099
yeah not even including second law of

7235.28 --> 7242.119
Thermodynamics influence it doesn't make

7238.099 --> 7246.32
anything about it work as a sphere but

7242.119 --> 7249.38
the magma is local it's right there in

7246.32 --> 7251.799999999999
that spot it's not a all the way through

7249.38 --> 7251.8
thing

7257.179 --> 7261.619
no that's not how it works at all break

7259.82 --> 7264.199
in the crust and the magma leaks out

7261.619 --> 7266.42
that's not how it works yeah there is

7264.199 --> 7270.5599999999995
places where there's literally fissures

7266.42 --> 7273.4400000000005
that means the alleged crust moving away

7270.56 --> 7275.4800000000005
from one another and creating giant

7273.44 --> 7277.119
Rifts yeah

7275.48 --> 7282.5599999999995
guess what

7277.119 --> 7284.42
lava never comes out of those

7282.56 --> 7287.659000000001
yeah

7284.42 --> 7291.32
like to see some evidence that there's a

7287.659 --> 7293.42
fissure forming somewhere on Earth and

7291.32 --> 7295.639
that there's lava coming out of it

7293.42 --> 7297.619
because that's never happened that only

7295.639 --> 7298.76
happens in movies

7297.619 --> 7301.339999999999
yeah

7298.76 --> 7303.320000000001
lava never comes out of fissures it only

7301.34 --> 7305.179
comes out of

7303.32 --> 7307.34
pressing

7305.179 --> 7310.4
that's where the pressure spills up the

7307.34 --> 7313.04
magma forms and then it comes out

7310.4 --> 7317.0599999999995
because of the pressure yeah eight

7313.04 --> 7320.179
Fisher never opens up and lava comes out

7317.06 --> 7323.139
that's never happened ever

7320.179 --> 7325.88
or I'd like to see some evidence

7323.139 --> 7328.119
I've never actually seen anything like

7325.88 --> 7328.119
that

7328.46 --> 7335.2390000000005
except for maybe a volcano heavy or if

7332.36 --> 7337.5199999999995
it is at a already known volcano if it's

7335.239 --> 7340.879999999999
on a fault line yeah a giant earthquake

7337.52 --> 7343.280000000001
made actually rupture even part of the

7340.88 --> 7346.219
volcano and then revealing some lava

7343.28 --> 7349.28
that was actually underneath it because

7346.219 --> 7351.56
it's directly at a volcano

7349.28 --> 7353.9
something like that might happen but

7351.56 --> 7355.46
it's never like somewhere land inwards

7353.9 --> 7356.839999999999
in another region where there's no

7355.46 --> 7359.96
volcanoes

7356.84 --> 7362.119000000001
at all or suddenly the ground ruptures

7359.96 --> 7364.719
like a fissure and lava comes out that's

7362.119 --> 7364.719
never happened

7365.0 --> 7370.46
show up more Freak No they only show up

7369.139 --> 7372.86
there

7370.46 --> 7375.7390000000005
don't you get a Dennis reel they only

7372.86 --> 7378.44
show up there

7375.739 --> 7381.098999999999
they don't just randomly show up in the

7378.44 --> 7381.098999999999
middle of something

7382.219 --> 7386.54
this is literally yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock

7385.219 --> 7388.76
hey

7386.54 --> 7391.9
don't talk to me like I'm not getting it

7388.76 --> 7391.900000000001
you dumbass

7391.94 --> 7397.299999999999
I've been looking into this a lot more

7394.82 --> 7400.04
than you have over the past few years

7397.3 --> 7401.96
you already said I'm just getting this

7400.04 --> 7403.639
from eighth grade what I got taught in

7401.96 --> 7406.159
school all those years ago well guess

7403.639 --> 7407.96
what I did a lot more looking into it

7406.159 --> 7410.239
than just that

7407.96 --> 7414.199
in the last few years I've got dedicated

7410.239 --> 7417.619
episodes to what are volcanoes yeah that

7414.199 --> 7419.54
was like six years ago now

7417.619 --> 7422.139
I've been on to this for a lot longer

7419.54 --> 7422.139
than you have

7433.31 --> 7436.379000000001
[Music]

7441.98 --> 7446.839999999999
yeah and you already said it does

7444.02 --> 7449.42
actually well show me yeah point point

7446.84 --> 7452.360000000001
me at the right spot

7449.42 --> 7455.119
reveal the photograph or the footage

7452.36 --> 7459.86
film footage

7455.119 --> 7462.98
of a Fisher opening not at a volcano not

7459.86 --> 7464.119
beside it or whatever but way outside of

7462.98 --> 7466.58
this

7464.119 --> 7469.639
circle of fire and all that right where

7466.58 --> 7471.92
the volcanoes are not there

7469.639 --> 7474.1990000000005
but completely somewhere else ground

7471.92 --> 7476.54
splitting up and suddenly a volcano

7474.199 --> 7479.0199999999995
forms there

7476.54 --> 7479.0199999999995
right

7479.06 --> 7484.88
show me

7481.46 --> 7487.34
or name the location they might look at

7484.88 --> 7489.679
it through Google Maps or something but

7487.34 --> 7491.78
just say something because you said it

7489.679 --> 7493.88
does actually but you

7491.78 --> 7497.08
you've yet to actually

7493.88 --> 7497.08
give an example

7512.599 --> 7517.329
foreign

7514.25 --> 7517.329
[Music]

7518.239 --> 7522.5
still got some time before I round out

7520.88 --> 7525.139
the show

7522.5 --> 7527.78
or you could send me an email if you

7525.139 --> 7530.36
really have it because I dude I love

7527.78 --> 7532.099
being proven wrong I love asserting

7530.36 --> 7534.08
something

7532.099 --> 7536.360000000001
and then somebody shoving in my face

7534.08 --> 7539.48
direct evidence that I'm wrong I like

7536.36 --> 7541.04
that because then I can update my

7539.48 --> 7543.5
insight

7541.04 --> 7547.159
nothing better to update my insight than

7543.5 --> 7549.26
just being openly humiliated in a minor

7547.159 --> 7550.699
Way by just being incorrect

7549.26 --> 7553.88
I love it

7550.699 --> 7555.259999999999
you can show me if I'm wrong show me

7553.88 --> 7557.06
then

7555.26 --> 7560.4800000000005
right but you gotta actually prove it

7557.06 --> 7563.179
just saying it doesn't really

7560.48 --> 7566.48
prove anything

7563.179 --> 7570.679
you have to actually show it then

7566.48 --> 7573.5599999999995
right and I can't really show my model I

7570.679 --> 7576.1990000000005
can only because it's just an idea I

7573.56 --> 7577.159000000001
don't have any tangible evidence just

7576.199 --> 7579.379999999999
have

7577.159 --> 7582.08
scatter data that I'm trying to put

7579.38 --> 7585.679
together and modeling it so I have a for

7582.08 --> 7588.0199999999995
another alternative conception of what

7585.679 --> 7588.9400000000005
it could all be instead of tectonic

7588.02 --> 7591.56
plates

7588.94 --> 7593.9
segments like stems

7591.56 --> 7596.360000000001
like they're basically all pillars

7593.9 --> 7598.879999999999
crammed together and at some part

7596.36 --> 7600.38
they're just really stick together in

7598.88 --> 7601.82
other parts they don't really stick

7600.38 --> 7604.34
together and that's where you get the

7601.82 --> 7606.259999999999
fault lines what what is called fault

7604.34 --> 7609.26
lines that's where the volcanic activity

7606.26 --> 7612.4400000000005
is because that's where it is most

7609.26 --> 7616.04
flexible most moving of all that Earth

7612.44 --> 7618.58
and rock in relation to another part

7616.04 --> 7622.219
yeah the segments

7618.58 --> 7625.46
that's a logical construction to

7622.219 --> 7630.8
envisage on how a lab I would be forming

7625.46 --> 7630.8
there locally and not underneath it huh

7632.9 --> 7635.9
foreign

7636.46 --> 7639.499
[Music]

7642.159 --> 7648.32
have been molted melted it cannot be

7646.639 --> 7651.02
it's impossible

7648.32 --> 7655.58
because there is Rock

7651.02 --> 7658.46
there has never been Molten it exists

7655.58 --> 7660.8
is provable that's never been more

7658.46 --> 7663.38
so that means it can't all just be

7660.8 --> 7666.400000000001
solidified magma

7663.38 --> 7666.400000000001
it's impossible

7667.58 --> 7672.199
there's Rock here on Earth that has

7670.34 --> 7673.28
never been Molten

7672.199 --> 7675.379999999999
ever

7673.28 --> 7678.0199999999995
in existence

7675.38 --> 7681.02
it's never been Molten

7678.02 --> 7685.179
there's basic logical conclusions that

7681.02 --> 7685.179
can be drawn from that existence

7685.52 --> 7689.719
and that is

7687.44 --> 7692.78
all of Earth cannot have formed from

7689.719 --> 7694.699
molten rock

7692.78 --> 7697.04
cannot be that because there's Rock

7694.699 --> 7699.678999999999
that's never been Molten

7697.04 --> 7701.48
there you go anyway I'm running out to

7699.679 --> 7704.119
show

7701.48 --> 7705.5599999999995
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7704.119 --> 7708.679
liked this show I thought it was pretty

7705.56 --> 7712.639
good I'm very inspired

7708.679 --> 7715.159
still with my Baldur's Gate 3 idea

7712.639 --> 7718.34
hope to get some feedback I did get some

7715.159 --> 7721.699
feedback from LSG

7718.34 --> 7724.76
although it wasn't really detailed

7721.699 --> 7727.339999999999
but yeah I'm gonna see if I can if I'm

7724.76 --> 7731.38
gonna let it lay there or if I'm already

7727.34 --> 7731.38
ready to expand some more

7731.9 --> 7737.9
uh anyway but anyway thanks everyone for

7735.86 --> 7739.639
coming I hope you liked the show if you

7737.9 --> 7741.379999999999
did then please don't forget to rogans

7739.639 --> 7743.4800000000005

7769.659 --> 7776.719
1523 on the Sunday hopefully it'll be

7773.0 --> 7778.58
just as nice weather as it is right now

hope to see you there in chat oh yeah

7778.58 --> 7783.38
also later this evening there will be

7780.56 --> 7785.3
ball busters live I will be on it

7783.38 --> 7787.96
I hope to see you there over at Quantum
