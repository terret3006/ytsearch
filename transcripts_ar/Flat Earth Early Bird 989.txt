108.159 --> 113.52000000000001
goes back and forth to

110.32 --> 117.19999999999999
slight rain to heavy rain

113.52 --> 117.2
but yeah it's pretty constant

118.159 --> 123.84
so right not the sunniest of sundays

125.28 --> 130.8
but it'll have to do

129.119 --> 135.12
right

130.8 --> 136.31900000000002
hello jason brown pj krishan

135.12 --> 139.20000000000002
rob h

good to see you guys

140.84 --> 149.31900000000002
uh it is

143.599 --> 149.319
sunday the 22nd of august 2021.

151.12 --> 154.879
and yeah i'll be doing a pretty short

153.36 --> 156.87900000000002
show

154.879 --> 159.28
especially compared to yesterday's two

156.879 --> 159.28
hours

160.08 --> 163.84
but yeah i'm

161.44 --> 166.8
usually

163.84 --> 169.04
ex uh expand another half hour so this

166.8 --> 171.76000000000002
is gonna be like slightly more than an

169.04 --> 174.239
hour show

171.76 --> 176.959
ah it's been raining there too

174.239 --> 178.8
did you cree shank

176.959 --> 181.36
yeah

178.8 --> 181.36
i'll bet

182.84 --> 188.08
boy

184.4 --> 188.08
so part of the reason i was late

188.4 --> 194.56
it was pretty late last night i tried

191.519 --> 196.8
not to but it just

194.56 --> 199.68
yeah

196.8 --> 201.59900000000002
it yeah it stayed up till five i don't

199.68 --> 204.959
know how i even did that

201.599 --> 206.959
without like falling asleep but i did

204.959 --> 208.0
and then this morning my alarm clock

206.959 --> 209.84
went off

208.0 --> 213.1
at the earlier site

209.84 --> 215.20000000000002
at the earlier time and then i was like

213.1 --> 217.44
[Music]

215.2 --> 219.44
but it's sunday

217.44 --> 222.4
and then i just slept kind of through it

219.44 --> 222.4
and then i

222.64 --> 227.83999999999997
woke up

224.08 --> 227.84
what is now an hour ago

229.84 --> 232.239
right

234.08 --> 240.76000000000002
ah that was deliberate i was delivered

237.519 --> 240.76000000000002
not really

247.76 --> 250.239
but yeah

251.12 --> 256.079
home benjamin did another stream like a

253.439 --> 259.359
saturday stream that's very unusual

256.079 --> 261.919
but yeah he followed up the stream

259.359 --> 265.03999999999996
from previous time

261.919 --> 265.03999999999996
with uh what

267.12 --> 270.08
what's the name again

270.24 --> 274.40000000000003
chris gardner

271.84 --> 274.4
that was it

274.639 --> 278.88
yeah he did a follow-up stream with it

277.28 --> 281.11999999999995
and was pretty

278.88 --> 283.84
interesting

281.12 --> 283.84000000000003
again

284.479 --> 292.0
like the guy was getting into his

287.919 --> 294.08
insights on like how allegedly the nazis

292.0 --> 295.04
won world war two it's

294.08 --> 297.84
quite

295.04 --> 297.84000000000003
well developed

301.52 --> 306.88
so yeah that was an unexpected bonus

304.72 --> 309.6
we'll see what happens today he's gonna

306.88 --> 313.039
do that again or

309.6 --> 315.28000000000003
we'll just see wait and see

313.039 --> 315.28
uh

316.56 --> 320.16
let's see what else is going down

321.44 --> 324.8
uh

322.24 --> 328.8
mitchell from australia

324.8 --> 328.8
another show but i completely missed it

329.039 --> 334.88
oh yeah martin litke of course

332.56 --> 338.52
flat earth british

334.88 --> 338.52
flatter day night

340.8 --> 343.44
that was fun

343.6 --> 348.16
oh yeah also dell went live on his own

345.919 --> 349.59999999999997
show he he actually visited my chat

348.16 --> 353.24
yesterday

349.6 --> 353.24
that was pretty cool

356.16 --> 359.84000000000003
but he did his own stream as well

360.08 --> 364.08
uh

361.6 --> 364.08000000000004
what else

364.72 --> 371.36
all right yeah flat side uploaded a

368.56 --> 374.56
a or i don't know if it's his video but

371.36 --> 376.88
he re-uploaded it anyway

374.56 --> 378.72
about the new moon

376.88 --> 382.479
and how it's supposed to be there and he

378.72 --> 385.03900000000004
put a filter on his camera and

382.479 --> 387.199
stared at the sun and then yeah no moon

385.039 --> 389.759
no moon shadow nothing

387.199 --> 393.52000000000004
when supposedly the sun glare is the

389.759 --> 395.52000000000004
thing that would make the moon invisible

393.52 --> 398.56
not seeable well with the filter that

395.52 --> 400.0
problem shouldn't be there yet no new

398.56 --> 402.479
moon

400.0 --> 405.039
so that was flat side he uploaded that

402.479 --> 405.039
this morning

405.12 --> 410.8
check it out

407.44 --> 410.8
pretty short video but good

414.24 --> 418.759
hey flat sorry talk about the devil

422.4 --> 424.71999999999997
right

435.039 --> 442.44
right i see montreal that's the guy

439.039 --> 442.44
from the video

458.96 --> 463.71999999999997
yeah also i got this weird sensation

466.56 --> 471.84
like remember i brought up like the

469.039 --> 473.599
taliban photograph with the ice creams

471.84 --> 475.35999999999996
to mark biden

473.599 --> 476.24
well i think that's

475.36 --> 478.72
like

476.24 --> 480.56
the first in a series or something i i

478.72 --> 483.44000000000005
think that the taliban is actually

480.56 --> 485.44
engaging in memetic warfare

483.44 --> 486.8
because they're they're doing all these

485.44 --> 489.36
kinds of

486.8 --> 491.28000000000003
mockery photographs now

489.36 --> 494.24
apparently they

491.28 --> 496.96
recently made a photograph

494.24 --> 496.96000000000004
so again

498.8 --> 505.16
yeah mocking the iojima

502.16 --> 505.16
flag

506.16 --> 509.68
that was made also into a statue

508.72 --> 512.32
so they

509.68 --> 514.479
yeah they're they're engaging in memetic

512.32 --> 515.7600000000001
warfare it's pretty bizarre

514.479 --> 518.5600000000001
and

515.76 --> 520.159
in a way it's not really that bizarre

518.56 --> 522.7189999999999
it seems like they're just getting with

520.159 --> 522.7189999999999
the times

525.36 --> 528.8000000000001
right

526.32 --> 532.44
i'll link you up

528.8 --> 532.4399999999999
let's check it out

540.64 --> 542.88
uh

546.959 --> 552.4799999999999
hey amanda young

549.68 --> 555.959
return to normal

552.48 --> 555.9590000000001
good to see you

564.32 --> 566.5600000000001
uh

568.8 --> 571.5999999999999
right so

570.72 --> 573.6
yeah

571.6 --> 576.0
i don't know if today's show is gonna be

573.6 --> 577.44
as interesting as yesterday's show

576.0 --> 580.16
because i really thought yesterday's

577.44 --> 580.1600000000001
show was great

580.56 --> 583.92
i think

581.44 --> 587.1600000000001
yeah i did also watch it back it was

583.92 --> 587.16
good stuff

599.92 --> 604.3199999999999
all right also i found this really

602.0 --> 606.24
bizarre

604.32 --> 609.7600000000001
little article that

606.24 --> 609.76
it's like super sneaky

610.88 --> 613.36
series

614.079 --> 618.56
only infowars but like this this has to

616.48 --> 620.88
be trickery right

618.56 --> 623.04
yeah let's see if you figure it out

620.88 --> 625.12
so apparently

623.04 --> 627.519
they found

625.12 --> 630.079
a letter

627.519 --> 630.839
from bin laden

630.079 --> 635.76
in

630.839 --> 639.2
2010 describing how biden will lead the

635.76 --> 639.2
us into crisis

643.2 --> 647.519
and now of course if you're just gonna

644.8 --> 649.4399999999999
take it for granted

647.519 --> 651.68
that's kind of interesting

649.44 --> 653.6800000000001
but then again

651.68 --> 656.3199999999999
i'm pretty sure that it's been figured

653.68 --> 658.8389999999999
out for a while now that bin laden

656.32 --> 661.7600000000001
actually died much earlier than

658.839 --> 664.8800000000001
that like on a kidney dialysis machine

661.76 --> 667.6
like what was it in 2003 or something

664.88 --> 670.88
and that the whole oh we got him

667.6 --> 672.32
under a biden was basically a a stage

670.88 --> 675.36
act

672.32 --> 677.6
so yeah where bin laden wrote this

675.36 --> 680.6
letter 2010 you say

677.6 --> 680.6
hmm

690.959 --> 693.3599999999999
right

693.6 --> 697.64
so here's the link to that

705.279 --> 709.56
there's some games being played

716.88 --> 719.8389999999999
anyway

717.92 --> 722.399
i'm not gonna like do the entire show

719.839 --> 727.24
about that or anything

722.399 --> 727.24
it was benny bin laden what's

749.519 --> 754.079
anyway according to that supposed letter

752.72 --> 756.72
bin laden

754.079 --> 759.12
deemed obama as a bigger threat than he

756.72 --> 761.36
did biden

759.12 --> 761.36
right

763.279 --> 769.04
it's just weird to think about like but

766.079 --> 773.04
who actually then wrote that letter

769.04 --> 775.5999999999999
what is this is this like some cia story

773.04 --> 778.079
draft thing

775.6 --> 780.88
or or is it like

778.079 --> 783.8389999999999
actually another like i don't know the

780.88 --> 786.0
the next contact i don't know man it is

783.839 --> 787.839
a bit of a mystery

786.0 --> 789.92
but yeah i don't know i don't know if

787.839 --> 793.7600000000001
you guys really care that much this is

789.92 --> 798.079
not really flat earth related at all

793.76 --> 798.079
but anyway it did stand out to me

798.399 --> 802.24
all right yeah yeah that happened too

800.24 --> 804.72
almost forgot about it yeah owen troyer

802.24 --> 807.2
arrest warren

804.72 --> 807.2
and like

808.56 --> 813.7199999999999
the most ridiculous reason for it

815.44 --> 819.2790000000001
like

816.639 --> 820.399
alex jones was like completely like

819.279 --> 823.04
totally

820.399 --> 824.8
in stutter overkill like he was really

823.04 --> 829.8
nervous

824.8 --> 829.8
in that report yesterday about it

834.16 --> 838.8389999999999
he might be next

835.839 --> 838.839
dude

848.639 --> 853.76
i i don't know what it is

851.12 --> 856.399
i don't know if they have a real inkling

853.76 --> 858.24
as to what that is

856.399 --> 860.959
like is this

858.24 --> 863.6
kind of like the same type of

860.959 --> 866.88
approach as was done with roger stone

863.6 --> 868.0
who's been like nagged

866.88 --> 869.4399999999999
and

868.0 --> 872.16
harassed

869.44 --> 874.72
through the legal system for such a long

872.16 --> 874.7199999999999
time now

874.8 --> 880.16
like aren't they basically pulling owen

877.519 --> 883.44
troyer in to do something similar like

880.16 --> 886.3199999999999
is he gonna get it now right

883.44 --> 888.639
i bet owen is very worried about that

886.32 --> 890.72
that that might happen to him now like

888.639 --> 893.92
he's not looking forward to that it's

890.72 --> 893.9200000000001
super big hassle

896.48 --> 899.36
right

897.36 --> 902.0790000000001
but i do feel for the guy right he

899.36 --> 904.0790000000001
definitely didn't deserve that

902.079 --> 907.199
definitely not

904.079 --> 907.199
owen is a good guy

911.44 --> 916.24
and like even the footage of that day

914.24 --> 918.9590000000001
and all that reveals

916.24 --> 920.9590000000001
that he was like really obsessed with

918.959 --> 923.8389999999999
keeping the peace he was acting like a

920.959 --> 926.959
peacekeeper a natural peacekeeper a lot

923.839 --> 930.0790000000001
alex too by the way but he definitely he

926.959 --> 930.079
just had that energy

930.959 --> 934.959
all right

932.639 --> 937.279
so yeah that is kind of an unnerving

934.959 --> 939.5189999999999
situation for them i bet

937.279 --> 941.36
i hope things work out and it's it's

939.519 --> 944.24
just

941.36 --> 946.8000000000001
a bit of a jump scare and not a horror

944.24 --> 948.5600000000001
story right

946.8 --> 952.5999999999999
i guess that's what they're hoping for i

948.56 --> 952.5999999999999
hope it for them as well

962.56 --> 968.68
hello jehua is king

965.199 --> 968.68
welcome to chat

978.8 --> 982.8
right yeah i was thinking about that

981.04 --> 985.04
return to normal

982.8 --> 986.8
i don't i have no idea of the

985.04 --> 987.5999999999999
implications right

986.8 --> 990.16
but

987.6 --> 993.279
couldn't he technically like

990.16 --> 993.279
flee to mexico

993.519 --> 997.6
might not really work out all that well

995.6 --> 999.6
i don't know they have better oversight

997.6 --> 1002.639
as to how that what kind of

999.6 --> 1004.88
complications come with that but

1002.639 --> 1006.9590000000001
like yeah i wouldn't want to be turning

1004.88 --> 1011.6
myself over to that either

1006.959 --> 1014.56
like every thing about that process

1011.6 --> 1017.1990000000001
is just totally unreasonable

1014.56 --> 1022.6389999999999
and slanderous and

1017.199 --> 1022.639
just bureaucracy on top of bureaucracy

1023.36 --> 1027.4
that's right he was press

1047.069 --> 1050.229
[Music]

1052.72 --> 1058.559
yeah like or maybe not mexico maybe you

1055.919 --> 1060.88
could like i have no idea how this works

1058.559 --> 1062.72
by the way this is just spitballing

1060.88 --> 1065.1200000000001
maybe you could like go to brazil or

1062.72 --> 1067.84
something

1065.12 --> 1067.84
like i know

1068.4 --> 1073.8400000000001
bolshinero is is kind of a fan of

1071.36 --> 1075.84
infowars so he would definitely give

1073.84 --> 1077.76
them like cover

1075.84 --> 1080.48
honest cover

1077.76 --> 1083.12
he would recognize them as press right

1080.48 --> 1086.24
so maybe that's an option i don't know

1083.12 --> 1086.2399999999998
just thinking out loud

1091.52 --> 1097.36
i'm pretty sure if that could work

1094.72 --> 1098.88
that boston arrow would absolutely just

1097.36 --> 1102.32
allow

1098.88 --> 1104.5590000000002
owen and who knows who else

1102.32 --> 1106.84
to basically set up like an infowars

1104.559 --> 1109.36
broadcast station in

1106.84 --> 1110.799
brazil and just keep going there or

1109.36 --> 1114.08
something i don't know i'm

1110.799 --> 1114.08
again thinking out loud

1116.48 --> 1120.08
who knows what's going to happen maybe

1118.24 --> 1122.48
it's all just a bit of a dud

1120.08 --> 1125.1999999999998
just this a little jump scare right we

1122.48 --> 1125.2
don't know yet

1135.12 --> 1138.32
hey david weiss

1142.32 --> 1148.559
fed is flat earth debate and flat earth

1145.52 --> 1148.559
death oh

1149.44 --> 1153.919
yeah but flattered the base was first

1151.679 --> 1153.919
though

1155.679 --> 1161.96
it's the original fed dave i know you

1158.559 --> 1161.96
wants it

1170.559 --> 1175.48
hey stas moretz good to see you

1189.28 --> 1194.72
right

1190.32 --> 1195.84
yeah it seems like fed is getting some

1194.72 --> 1198.48
well

1195.84 --> 1200.08
i guess you could say higher tier influx

1198.48 --> 1202.32
of people

1200.08 --> 1202.32
like

1202.72 --> 1207.52
a couple of owen of owens own benjamin's

1206.159 --> 1208.64
friends

1207.52 --> 1209.84
i think

1208.64 --> 1212.5590000000002
yeah

1209.84 --> 1214.799
they are like jim bob like jim bob seems

1212.559 --> 1218.44
to be really into flat earth debates now

1214.799 --> 1218.44
which is pretty awesome

1220.48 --> 1227.52
and i bet it's going to have a like a a

1223.36 --> 1227.52
what do you call that a pulling effect

1228.64 --> 1232.72
so i bet it's going to be interesting

1230.48 --> 1235.84
times overall at the flat earth debates

1232.72 --> 1235.84
in the coming months

1238.72 --> 1244.84
and with you too of course with

1241.84 --> 1244.84
david

1256.559 --> 1261.8799999999999
where did you dig up that postal guy

1258.88 --> 1261.88
what

1301.679 --> 1307.3600000000001
all

1302.84 --> 1307.36
right what else what's happening

1308.88 --> 1316.5200000000002
all right yeah of course anti lockdown

1311.44 --> 1316.52
protests everywhere keeps going

1319.919 --> 1324.5590000000002
so i'm going really hard at it in

1322.24 --> 1326.64
australia recently

1324.559 --> 1328.8799999999999
like really hard

1326.64 --> 1328.88
like

1330.48 --> 1334.96
some of it almost seems like actual

1332.559 --> 1334.96
riots

1336.559 --> 1341.2
because uh the australian police is just

1339.12 --> 1344.1589999999999
so unreasonable

1341.2 --> 1347.039
they are they are acting such like such

1344.159 --> 1350.0
thugs man it's unbelievable like it's

1347.039 --> 1352.64
not really great every anywhere but over

1350.0 --> 1354.799
there they're just like total

1352.64 --> 1359.5200000000002
well nazis they're just acting like

1354.799 --> 1359.52
nazis being completely insensitive

1359.6 --> 1365.12
it's disgusting

1362.159 --> 1367.2
so yeah i'm glad australians are

1365.12 --> 1371.4399999999998
starting to understand like yeah this

1367.2 --> 1371.44
you you cannot just sit through that

1372.84 --> 1379.84
[ __ ] and in france they're still

1375.52 --> 1379.84
protesting the the passport thing

1380.0 --> 1384.48
all right you know the french once they

1382.08 --> 1386.96
are once they start a protest they they

1384.48 --> 1388.88
usually finish it

1386.96 --> 1391.3600000000001
they can keep on going for a long time

1388.88 --> 1393.2800000000002
over there it's a tradition

1391.36 --> 1395.76
and

1393.28 --> 1396.799
yeah england as well it's dude it's

1395.76 --> 1400.6
everywhere

1396.799 --> 1400.6
it's getting pretty heavy

1413.919 --> 1418.7990000000002
they put wristbands on the vaccine what

1428.559 --> 1436.6399999999999
media turn them into bad dude the media

1432.96 --> 1439.8400000000001
in these bad areas

1436.64 --> 1442.64
are the media is so terrible

1439.84 --> 1445.6
that like even little kids should be

1442.64 --> 1447.3600000000001
feeling it like they're liars

1445.6 --> 1448.24
like they're such

1447.36 --> 1450.3999999999999
like

1448.24 --> 1453.1200000000001
liars to a level where they're basically

1450.4 --> 1455.279
just making little [ __ ] accusations

1453.12 --> 1456.6399999999999
they're acting almost like trolls but

1455.279 --> 1458.559
the trolls

1456.64 --> 1462.0
are in control

1458.559 --> 1466.3999999999999
that's a big problem for everybody

1462.0 --> 1469.76
it makes everybody just nasty and dumb

1466.4 --> 1472.4
with stupid accusations constantly and

1469.76 --> 1474.64
constantly turning everything inside out

1472.4 --> 1477.039
blaming all the problems on the ones not

1474.64 --> 1479.76
cooperating when it's obviously

1477.039 --> 1481.919
the problems are caused by by

1479.76 --> 1484.64
cooperating

1481.919 --> 1487.8400000000001
it's pretty sick

1484.64 --> 1487.8400000000001
the media is the virus

1502.88 --> 1505.8400000000001
right well look

1504.799 --> 1509.6
they can

1505.84 --> 1512.84
screw around with the supposed passport

1509.6 --> 1514.3999999999999
all they want it's not gonna happen

1512.84 --> 1517.1999999999998
right

1514.4 --> 1518.5590000000002
specific regions might be locked in and

1517.2 --> 1521.1200000000001
tricked

1518.559 --> 1522.48
but that that's going to be small things

1521.12 --> 1525.6789999999999
and it's going to be

1522.48 --> 1527.76
private it's going to be

1525.679 --> 1530.3200000000002
well like cities that are basically in

1527.76 --> 1533.2
control of somebody that just enforces

1530.32 --> 1535.12
that and they're legally locked in

1533.2 --> 1537.6000000000001
but they can never

1535.12 --> 1539.36
do that everywhere they cannot just do

1537.6 --> 1542.36
something like that nationwide it's

1539.36 --> 1542.36
impossible

1564.0 --> 1568.559
international brotherhood of police

1566.159 --> 1568.5590000000002
chiefs

1568.84 --> 1575.12
yeah a lot of them especially in the

1572.72 --> 1576.88
regions where this [ __ ] is happening are

1575.12 --> 1579.84
indeed

1576.88 --> 1583.4
in the club they're part of it

1579.84 --> 1583.3999999999999
they have to be

1585.2 --> 1589.039
but that doesn't mean that literally all

1587.44 --> 1591.679
police chiefs

1589.039 --> 1594.1589999999999
police chiefs in the world are

1591.679 --> 1596.64
in on it though

1594.159 --> 1599.8400000000001
they're still human

1596.64 --> 1599.8400000000001
they still have a choice

1604.96 --> 1610.3600000000001
hey gaining wisdom by the way good to

1607.2 --> 1610.3600000000001
see you

1659.6 --> 1664.039
yeah that's right return to normal

1690.96 --> 1694.6000000000001
uh what

1696.64 --> 1700.279
i don't get it dominoid

1702.88 --> 1706.009
[Music]

1725.6 --> 1730.08
right anyway

1727.279 --> 1732.24
yeah other than just describing what's

1730.08 --> 1733.6
going on

1732.24 --> 1735.919
i don't really have

1733.6 --> 1738.0
ideas to contribute

1735.919 --> 1742.679
about it

1738.0 --> 1742.679
no use just dwelling on all that

1765.36 --> 1767.84
hmm

1792.24 --> 1796.64
oh i like this one

1795.44 --> 1799.52
it's just

1796.64 --> 1802.3990000000001
rhetoric but

1799.52 --> 1802.399
i do like it

1805.679 --> 1809.76
i think

1806.84 --> 1813.76
yeah it's kind of obvious by now but

1809.76 --> 1813.76
it's good to hear that he said that

1821.279 --> 1824.08
wait maybe i should

1824.799 --> 1829.84
link just to the video it's no that's

1830.559 --> 1833.6
yeah i'll just link to this video

1832.48 --> 1837.039
directly

1833.6 --> 1840.6
instead of that page

1837.039 --> 1840.6
it's much better

1867.6 --> 1870.6
so

1891.84 --> 1897.559
yeah woke is weak

1894.32 --> 1897.559
it is

1918.559 --> 1921.279
what

1919.519 --> 1924.08
the rally

1921.279 --> 1927.2
what the rally

1924.08 --> 1927.1999999999998
which rally is that

1930.799 --> 1933.799
what

1937.44 --> 1942.0
um

1939.6 --> 1943.9189999999999
i think a fire just broke out somewhere

1942.0 --> 1945.84
here

1943.919 --> 1948.5590000000002
not in this

1945.84 --> 1951.9599999999998
just there's a lot of

1948.559 --> 1951.96
fire trucks

1965.64 --> 1968.739
[Music]

1969.279 --> 1973.64
that's not anywhere near here

1979.44 --> 1984.0
all right you watch the the trump rally

1981.679 --> 1984.0
right

1986.08 --> 1992.0
it's hard to not think of them as the

1988.159 --> 1993.919
greatest visa well yeah dude the problem

1992.0 --> 1995.44
is he's a chill

1993.919 --> 1997.3600000000001
trump

1995.44 --> 2001.1200000000001
is like a salesman

1997.36 --> 2001.12
and that like that effect

2001.2 --> 2005.6000000000001
is like really

2002.88 --> 2007.8400000000001
core so he like

2005.6 --> 2009.9189999999999
he just fell for it and he had to go

2007.84 --> 2014.6
along with it

2009.919 --> 2014.6000000000001
but he's not proud of it

2019.36 --> 2026.24
but yeah effectively by doing that he

2021.919 --> 2029.519
absolutely poisoned his own well

2026.24 --> 2032.159
because nobody

2029.519 --> 2034.3990000000001
that was with trump was gonna agree with

2032.159 --> 2034.3990000000001
that

2040.559 --> 2044.8799999999999
like anybody that was informed was just

2042.64 --> 2047.279
gonna be like that's

2044.88 --> 2050.0
a really stupid move

2047.279 --> 2052.24
everybody said that i said that alex

2050.0 --> 2054.0
jones said it on troya said it like all

2052.24 --> 2057.1189999999997
of them everybody

2054.0 --> 2059.359
out there knew trump what the [ __ ] are

2057.119 --> 2063.44
you doing you idiot

2059.359 --> 2063.44
you unbelievable shill

2063.76 --> 2068.7200000000003
and he stuck to it too

2065.919 --> 2070.56
but he knows now he he's probably like

2068.72 --> 2073.4399999999996
the smokes cleared up he

2070.56 --> 2075.839
he does realize he shut off his own foot

2073.44 --> 2075.839
with that

2076.399 --> 2080.04
i think he knows

2108.64 --> 2112.0
right well tricked

2110.96 --> 2114.48
i

2112.0 --> 2117.119
it would have to be trick but he also

2114.48 --> 2119.2
doubled down like a salesman like the

2117.119 --> 2120.7200000000003
salesman that he is right that's also

2119.2 --> 2121.7599999999998
part of the problem

2120.72 --> 2124.0789999999997
but yeah

2121.76 --> 2126.48
that's just the thing he that's how he

2124.079 --> 2130.599
operates right once once you choose

2126.48 --> 2130.599
something you go with it

2131.92 --> 2136.839
and it was a very bad call on his part

2157.839 --> 2162.44
hello clary good to see you

2204.4 --> 2208.56
right so yeah guys gals

2209.76 --> 2214.92
anything else

2211.119 --> 2214.92
you want me to discuss

2235.359 --> 2240.3199999999997
i'm kind of hoping to hear back from

2238.0 --> 2241.28
clutch bear i wonder if he successfully

2240.32 --> 2245.76
can

2241.28 --> 2245.76
relayed my show to mountain bear

2248.0 --> 2251.56
yesterday show

2313.76 --> 2317.92
or we could have

2315.28 --> 2320.96
a brilliant three-minute silence in chat

2317.92 --> 2323.119
that's all so fine why not it is sunday

2320.96 --> 2327.839
after all

2323.119 --> 2327.839
hey tony whitcomb good to see you

2342.8 --> 2348.32
any protests over there

2345.599 --> 2350.079
you mean over here

2348.32 --> 2355.44
uh

2350.079 --> 2358.48
there are a couple of organized ones

2355.44 --> 2361.839
but yeah not in this very city

2358.48 --> 2363.76
that i know that i know of anyway

2361.839 --> 2366.0
you're focused on your coffee cleary

2363.76 --> 2366.0
okay

2367.52 --> 2374.0
right but return to normal like protests

2371.44 --> 2377.28
there is a lot of awareness against

2374.0 --> 2379.599
what's going on and there's a lot of

2377.28 --> 2381.2000000000003
like also political inquiry there's a

2379.599 --> 2383.92
lot of people like

2381.2 --> 2387.04
being journalists

2383.92 --> 2387.04
right on top of it

2392.56 --> 2396.96
like

2394.079 --> 2399.2000000000003
we the politicians here still try to do

2396.96 --> 2401.359
sneaky [ __ ]

2399.2 --> 2403.7599999999998
like i heard recently

2401.359 --> 2403.7599999999998
like the

2404.24 --> 2409.359
our prime minister which isn't even

2406.56 --> 2411.2
officially in function right it's just

2409.359 --> 2413.52
the missionary

2411.2 --> 2416.3999999999996
a temporary sit-in because actually the

2413.52 --> 2418.079
government is not officially formed

2416.4 --> 2420.8
because of a scandal

2418.079 --> 2423.52
that he was at the head of right but he

2420.8 --> 2424.48
recently just appointed a minister just

2423.52 --> 2425.92
like that

2424.48 --> 2428.56
like

2425.92 --> 2431.2000000000003
with executive order

2428.56 --> 2432.319
and nobody really knows what to do about

2431.2 --> 2434.0789999999997
it

2432.319 --> 2435.599
that was a bit freaky

2434.079 --> 2436.6400000000003
i think that was like a week ago or

2435.599 --> 2437.599
something

2436.64 --> 2440.7999999999997
but

2437.599 --> 2440.8
other than that like

2441.119 --> 2449.839
our government like is try just trying

2446.16 --> 2453.5989999999997
to constantly push it through somehow

2449.839 --> 2456.24
but they're getting a lot of resistance

2453.599 --> 2459.28
on pretty high levels

2456.24 --> 2463.2
so overall yeah we don't have

2459.28 --> 2466.0
mask mandates social distance mandates

2463.2 --> 2467.359
vaccine mandates at all here like

2466.0 --> 2470.64
nothing

2467.359 --> 2472.7999999999997
but there st there is still issues with

2470.64 --> 2475.2799999999997
corporations

2472.8 --> 2479.48
demanding it for their company right

2475.28 --> 2479.48
that is still there

2481.28 --> 2487.8390000000004
but even those are getting issues

2485.76 --> 2491.76
from it because people are not just like

2487.839 --> 2493.839
oh yes please please give it to me right

2491.76 --> 2496.079
away i don't want to risk losing my

2493.839 --> 2497.359
precious job now that's not happening

2496.079 --> 2500.5600000000004
either

2497.359 --> 2500.56
i mean there's some of those

2500.8 --> 2504.8
but it's not like all of them at all

2505.2 --> 2512.24
and there is a lot of

2509.2 --> 2513.7599999999998
awareness that has been seeping through

2512.24 --> 2516.72
over the last year

2513.76 --> 2518.3190000000004
through alternative media like

2516.72 --> 2519.5989999999997
and in

2518.319 --> 2523.04
in a way

2519.599 --> 2525.28
like the the mainstream media spell

2523.04 --> 2527.92
about it like it's all good

2525.28 --> 2530.8
like it is people are starting to see

2527.92 --> 2533.28
through it like even the stupid ones

2530.8 --> 2536.1600000000003
right so eventually it's only the ones

2533.28 --> 2538.88
that are will just not be able to handle

2536.16 --> 2541.44
reality at all not even recognize that

2538.88 --> 2543.52
the media is lying that it's all wrong

2541.44 --> 2545.68
those might still get caught up in the

2543.52 --> 2549.119
[ __ ] and do something really stupid

2545.68 --> 2551.52
to themselves because of it

2549.119 --> 2553.92
but overall people are just catching on

2551.52 --> 2555.7599999999998
like yeah this is so

2553.92 --> 2558.2400000000002
bad business

2555.76 --> 2562.0
the government is the problem or rather

2558.24 --> 2562.0
the people right now in government

2563.44 --> 2565.839
so

2570.319 --> 2574.319
so i think like you could i guess you

2572.64 --> 2575.92
could say we have kind of a good start

2574.319 --> 2579.359
with the public

2575.92 --> 2581.76
but it's not over yet

2579.359 --> 2583.68
the grapplers up there still have a

2581.76 --> 2586.6800000000003
whole bunch a whole range of sneaky

2583.68 --> 2586.68
tricks

2594.0 --> 2597.44
there is the titan

2600.56 --> 2604.4
we need to separate the hurt no aries

2603.359 --> 2607.4
that's

2604.4 --> 2607.4
preposterous

2610.4 --> 2613.44
no

2611.119 --> 2615.839
we don't need to do anything

2613.44 --> 2617.68
the vax that are out of their minds that

2615.839 --> 2618.88
want more and more and more until they

2617.68 --> 2621.839
die

2618.88 --> 2623.28
they will separate themselves out out of

2621.839 --> 2625.599
paranoia

2623.28 --> 2626.96
of the non-vexed

2625.599 --> 2628.6400000000003
right

2626.96 --> 2630.16
we don't need to be

2628.64 --> 2632.7999999999997
paranoid

2630.16 --> 2635.2799999999997
a lot of it is [ __ ]

2632.8 --> 2637.04
like really bad [ __ ] and like even

2635.28 --> 2639.52
rumors

2637.04 --> 2642.0
like this whole

2639.52 --> 2644.4
shedding thing

2642.0 --> 2646.48
i don't believe it

2644.4 --> 2648.079
i think it has to do with frequency

2646.48 --> 2651.92
resonance i think it has to do with

2648.079 --> 2651.92
personal energy field which this

2652.079 --> 2656.5600000000004
v

2654.0 --> 2658.88
also has an influence on

2656.56 --> 2661.599
like already measurably reportedly has

2658.88 --> 2664.319
influence like on how people feel and

2661.599 --> 2668.8
like even freaking magnetic oh

2664.319 --> 2668.8
talking about which i almost forgot

2669.119 --> 2672.56
i got a special package today in the

2671.44 --> 2675.56
mail

2672.56 --> 2675.56
yesterday

2676.64 --> 2682.24
from mark smylier i take it there's

2679.04 --> 2685.2
something heavy in there

2682.24 --> 2687.2
so yeah i think he did actually send

2685.2 --> 2690.96
those magnets

2687.2 --> 2693.7599999999998
i'll unpack them after this

2690.96 --> 2693.76
i almost forgot

2695.92 --> 2699.44
right but i think that this whole

2698.319 --> 2701.359
shedding

2699.44 --> 2703.2000000000003
of somebody else gets sick when they

2701.359 --> 2705.839
didn't get the v

2703.2 --> 2708.0
i think that it's not because of an

2705.839 --> 2709.839
infection i think it is due to resonance

2708.0 --> 2713.119
so yeah if you're going to hang around

2709.839 --> 2715.839
with hysterical people

2713.119 --> 2720.319
that have poison in them

2715.839 --> 2722.24
and are just weird insane

2720.319 --> 2724.72
and you know you you've learned to

2722.24 --> 2726.3999999999996
tolerate that yeah yeah well

2724.72 --> 2727.68
i think that just hanging around with

2726.4 --> 2730.0
that

2727.68 --> 2734.319
that can cause like damage to your

2730.0 --> 2734.319
spirit body and make you sick

2737.68 --> 2743.04
but that has more to do with just

2740.88 --> 2745.599
those people

2743.04 --> 2748.72
how they are and not like whether they

2745.599 --> 2751.119
were vaccinated or not because there are

2748.72 --> 2753.7599999999998
people out there that have like taken

2751.119 --> 2755.52
the first fee and they

2753.76 --> 2757.92
realized what the what the hell was

2755.52 --> 2759.68
going on they were warned and then they

2757.92 --> 2762.319
don't take another and then they just

2759.68 --> 2764.3999999999996
kind of like yeah okay i

2762.319 --> 2766.48
that's not what i thought it was

2764.4 --> 2768.96
are those people gonna shed i don't

2766.48 --> 2768.96
think so

2769.28 --> 2773.92
right why would we

2771.599 --> 2777.44
want it all to separate up like that no

2773.92 --> 2780.48
no just let the paranoid

2777.44 --> 2781.68
insane people separate themselves from

2780.48 --> 2783.76
us

2781.68 --> 2788.0
let them do it right

2783.76 --> 2790.96
all the supposed camps that are built

2788.0 --> 2795.359
it's not for us it's for them

2790.96 --> 2799.079
they will want to go there you see

2795.359 --> 2799.0789999999997
that's how this works

2808.0 --> 2811.68
he has seeking star wars i know

2813.28 --> 2816.28
i've

2816.64 --> 2824.04
spike protein yeah yeah

2820.0 --> 2824.04
that's all internal though

2851.2 --> 2856.64
what would you guess the v uptake in

2853.68 --> 2856.64
holland is uh

2857.52 --> 2860.72
it's still pretty high

2862.72 --> 2868.64
and because unfortunately a lot of

2865.28 --> 2870.2400000000002
people did just like a run for it like

2868.64 --> 2873.839
ran to get it

2870.24 --> 2873.839
they were very stupid

2875.359 --> 2879.7599999999998
and there's still people that just take

2877.599 --> 2880.559
it

2879.76 --> 2882.7200000000003
that

2880.559 --> 2885.599
unfortunately the country does know a

2882.72 --> 2887.5989999999997
lot of gullible people like really

2885.599 --> 2891.119
really gullible

2887.599 --> 2894.0
because they're they're raised

2891.119 --> 2895.76
very liberal and part of that is you

2894.0 --> 2897.2
believe there's nothing wrong with

2895.76 --> 2901.28
anything

2897.2 --> 2904.7599999999998
except if you are against that freedom

2901.28 --> 2904.76
to be an idiot

2915.68 --> 2919.7599999999998
so yeah there's still plenty people that

2917.44 --> 2922.4
got it here and there will

2919.76 --> 2924.7200000000003
absolutely guarantee

2922.4 --> 2928.04
be a medical crisis because of it in the

2924.72 --> 2928.04
near future

2929.52 --> 2932.079
guarantee

2933.599 --> 2939.319
but i don't know the extent of it yet

2948.4 --> 2953.76
you mean entire cities

2950.8 --> 2957.8390000000004
no but that's different though that's

2953.76 --> 2957.8390000000004
those are just like city states

2958.079 --> 2964.96
that already basically collect

2961.52 --> 2967.119
those naughty type of npc people let's

2964.96 --> 2970.4
just degrade them a little bit let's

2967.119 --> 2973.44
just call them npcs yes

2970.4 --> 2977.44
mega cities will be filled with npcs the

2973.44 --> 2977.44
npcs will be the ones that have

2977.92 --> 2984.88
are more likely to have taken it

2980.88 --> 2986.7200000000003
and so they will just like become

2984.88 --> 2988.96
v cities

2986.72 --> 2991.52
and i think like in america that's like

2988.96 --> 2991.52
new york

2991.92 --> 2994.4
and

2992.25 --> 2998.04
[Music]

2994.4 --> 2998.04
like san francisco

3000.0 --> 3005.119
not sure but new york seems to be very

3002.559 --> 3007.52
much on the list for becoming complete v

3005.119 --> 3007.52
cities

3008.4 --> 3012.7200000000003
check out doctor

3010.079 --> 3016.2000000000003
yeah yeah that's

3012.72 --> 3016.2
it's all fine

3035.839 --> 3039.04
yeah she's pretty epic

3039.839 --> 3045.7599999999998
she's been at this for so long like even

3042.96 --> 3048.96
in 2010

3045.76 --> 3051.28
when i wasn't into flat earth yet

3048.96 --> 3052.4
now there were the the anti-vaxxers

3051.28 --> 3054.7200000000003
there were the

3052.4 --> 3057.28
again at the time it was like the swine

3054.72 --> 3059.359
flu and the bird flu [ __ ]

3057.28 --> 3060.48
and dr timpini was on top of that as

3059.359 --> 3061.839
well

3060.48 --> 3064.4
back then

3061.839 --> 3066.7999999999997
and was like even used as sources even

3064.4 --> 3069.04
back then so yeah she's been at it for a

3066.8 --> 3071.44
long long time she's really she's really

3069.04 --> 3075.2
good at what she does

3071.44 --> 3075.2000000000003
i definitely appreciate her

3076.0 --> 3080.4
very strong and brave woman

3079.04 --> 3084.079
and not just

3080.4 --> 3086.319
virtue signal is saying it actually

3084.079 --> 3089.28
but yeah if you have the senses then you

3086.319 --> 3092.68
can tell that just by

3089.28 --> 3092.6800000000003
watching her

3105.119 --> 3108.119
uh

3119.28 --> 3124.8
right but

3121.44 --> 3124.8
it's good to store that link

3138.72 --> 3143.9199999999996
okay well poku chai dort [ __ ]

3144.0 --> 3148.319
that sounds really nice of you but

3153.68 --> 3158.16
you could have done it in another way

3155.839 --> 3158.16
though

3161.839 --> 3167.599
right you're not actually helping your

3164.96 --> 3171.119
kid those kids by taking it

3167.599 --> 3173.28
by taking it you actually risk them fro

3171.119 --> 3177.28
from becoming

3173.28 --> 3178.6400000000003
well shedded on as it is identified now

3177.28 --> 3180.8
right

3178.64 --> 3182.64
so yeah you think you wanted to help

3180.8 --> 3185.6800000000003
that's how you saw that in your head but

3182.64 --> 3188.0
did you really help them

3185.68 --> 3190.3999999999996
how about in 10 years

3188.0 --> 3193.76
how about in 10 years will you still be

3190.4 --> 3195.52
able to help them when they grow older

3193.76 --> 3196.88
how about then have you thought about

3195.52 --> 3199.2
that

3196.88 --> 3201.119
or were you a little rash and you just

3199.2 --> 3203.359
thought that you could just casually

3201.119 --> 3205.2000000000003
sacrifice your own health

3203.359 --> 3207.2799999999997
like that because you have a strong

3205.2 --> 3209.839
heart right now

3207.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
right

3213.359 --> 3220.72
how long do you think that's gonna last

3217.04 --> 3223.04
like spike proteins actually attack that

3220.72 --> 3225.2799999999997
right oh you could have the strongest

3223.04 --> 3228.24
heart in the world well if then suddenly

3225.28 --> 3230.48
the protein basis of its strength is

3228.24 --> 3234.16
going to be attacked

3230.48 --> 3234.16
how strong do you think it will be then

3234.72 --> 3237.2
yeah

3235.599 --> 3238.6400000000003
yeah you never thought about that that's

3237.2 --> 3241.359
the problem

3238.64 --> 3243.839
everybody just thinks they can casually

3241.359 --> 3247.04
sacrifice their health to solve some

3243.839 --> 3250.839
temporary situation oh it's just me you

3247.04 --> 3250.839
don't know what you're doing

3251.04 --> 3253.92
that's the problem

3254.88 --> 3258.2400000000002
you think you can just

3258.8 --> 3263.119
sacrifice

3260.64 --> 3266.0
yourself in ways you don't even fully

3263.119 --> 3268.6400000000003
understand but you knew already there

3266.0 --> 3272.0
were risks it was already a sacrifice to

3268.64 --> 3274.0789999999997
and you just casually decided that you

3272.0 --> 3276.559
that it's good to do that

3274.079 --> 3278.6400000000003
how how is it good i don't think you

3276.559 --> 3280.4
really thought about i think you just

3278.64 --> 3282.96
actually

3280.4 --> 3284.1600000000003
wanted to move on and not let it be an

3282.96 --> 3287.2
issue

3284.16 --> 3288.8799999999997
and thus surrendered to it i think that

3287.2 --> 3293.0789999999997
is what you really did

3288.88 --> 3293.079
sorry to bring it to you like that

3303.359 --> 3309.2799999999997
what link what did i miss lou rockwell

3308.4 --> 3311.599
uh

3309.28 --> 3311.599
okay

3312.799 --> 3318.72
nothing can stop when it's coming

3316.4 --> 3318.7200000000003
uh

3319.359 --> 3324.48
there's nothing there

3322.559 --> 3327.44
oh wait there's a video four minute

3324.48 --> 3331.28
video yeah i'm not gonna watch that

3327.44 --> 3333.04
i'm not gonna watch a audio only

3331.28 --> 3336.1600000000003
video

3333.04 --> 3336.16
during my live show

3339.119 --> 3343.92
right an article sure i can read that

3341.68 --> 3346.3999999999996
i'm not gonna play some video i don't

3343.92 --> 3350.2400000000002
know on my show

3346.4 --> 3350.2400000000002
wanna get me into trouble or something

3356.88 --> 3360.6400000000003
what's the average time it takes to die

3359.28 --> 3363.2000000000003
from the jeep

3360.64 --> 3364.5589999999997
i don't know

3363.2 --> 3367.9199999999996
and look

3364.559 --> 3370.4
dr tim penny has a very well

3367.92 --> 3372.2400000000002
studied well formulated opinion about

3370.4 --> 3375.2000000000003
that

3372.24 --> 3376.8799999999997
i'm basically copying my judgment of

3375.2 --> 3379.52
that

3376.88 --> 3380.839
because she is like she actually knows

3379.52 --> 3383.04
the

3380.839 --> 3384.5589999999997
microbiology details of it and has an

3383.04 --> 3388.0
oversight i

3384.559 --> 3390.079
kind of have a preliminary model

3388.0 --> 3392.319
in my mind and i know it's good i'm very

3390.079 --> 3395.44
good at doing that

3392.319 --> 3395.44
but i'm not like

3395.76 --> 3402.3190000000004
as medically studied as she is

3399.599 --> 3405.119
she's and she's really well studied

3402.319 --> 3407.2799999999997
right but she said from what i remember

3405.119 --> 3409.04
like yeah it can be you could instantly

3407.28 --> 3410.96
just your body can't collapse under it

3409.04 --> 3413.52
especially during the

3410.96 --> 3416.0
well when it's still very poison

3413.52 --> 3419.839
but la yeah the spike protein buildup

3416.0 --> 3419.839
that can range from

3420.559 --> 3424.48
well anywhere between the moment you

3422.88 --> 3425.2000000000003
took it

3424.48 --> 3426.559
to

3425.2 --> 3428.799
5

3426.559 --> 3431.6800000000003
years

3428.799 --> 3433.68
10 years 15 years if you're really lucky

3431.68 --> 3435.359
it all depends also on

3433.68 --> 3437.7599999999998
like

3435.359 --> 3440.48
how much

3437.76 --> 3442.7990000000004
production of it is actually caused like

3440.48 --> 3445.2
how many cells have been transformed

3442.799 --> 3447.44
because of the v to produce that right

3445.2 --> 3450.0
what is the quantity of it and also how

3447.44 --> 3452.64
much can your body

3450.0 --> 3455.04
process it out of your system

3452.64 --> 3458.16
during the so it all depends on those

3455.04 --> 3460.24
like parameters and it can take from

3458.16 --> 3464.0
very short that your body collapses

3460.24 --> 3464.0
under it to quite a long time

3465.119 --> 3468.4
all right

3466.319 --> 3471.119
anyway

3468.4 --> 3471.119
check this out

3471.44 --> 3475.839
there's some easy way to open this thing

3484.0 --> 3489.64
magnets oh guess what it's not sticking

3486.48 --> 3489.64
to me

3489.68 --> 3495.9199999999996
oh those are pretty heavy magnets

3494.24 --> 3499.4399999999996
interesting

3495.92 --> 3499.44
thank you mark smiler

3501.599 --> 3506.079
damn these things are strong

3504.24 --> 3508.16
like that's those are some strong

3506.079 --> 3509.44
freaking magnets

3508.16 --> 3512.64
right

3509.44 --> 3516.0
so let's get this [ __ ] rumor out of

3512.64 --> 3517.2
the way once and for jesus christ let's

3516.0 --> 3519.44
think straight

3517.2 --> 3522.24
let's get out the way the rumors once

3519.44 --> 3522.2400000000002
forever for all

3523.119 --> 3525.44
right

3527.119 --> 3532.4
oh no i'm magnetic

3529.52 --> 3532.4
oh no i'm not

3537.92 --> 3542.839
right

3540.0 --> 3547.119
let's check it out

3542.839 --> 3548.319
man oh god oh no am i

3547.119 --> 3552.079
magnetic

3548.319 --> 3552.079
oh no no i'm not

3552.559 --> 3558.4
all right trust me this thing

3554.799 --> 3559.9
this thing's freaking sticks

3558.4 --> 3561.119
yeah so

3559.9 --> 3563.28
[Music]

3561.119 --> 3567.599

3563.28 --> 3569.44
can you stop it now mark can you stop

3567.599 --> 3573.1600000000003
the [ __ ]

3569.44 --> 3573.16
damn look at this

3576.4 --> 3583.04
i thank you for the magnets

3579.839 --> 3585.52
i however am not magnetic but i like

3583.04 --> 3589.34
having this giant magnet wand almost

3585.52 --> 3592.559
feels like a fascist or something

3589.34 --> 3592.559
[Music]

3596.319 --> 3600.72
oh no

3597.52 --> 3603.44
my spell wand oh

3600.72 --> 3603.4399999999996
and it's back

3604.799 --> 3610.24
yeah thank you

so yeah i thank you mark and i hope that

3663.52 --> 3668.64
laid

3665.599 --> 3673.52
your conspiracy theory about me secretly

3668.64 --> 3676.0
having been part of a testing operation

3673.52 --> 3678.16
i've not been injected

3676.0 --> 3680.64
wrench him

3678.16 --> 3682.16
uh no he just got in here

3680.64 --> 3685.839
amanda young i'm not gonna wrench

3682.16 --> 3685.839
somebody that just joined

3690.96 --> 3695.28
right membership systems don't

3692.72 --> 3699.72
automatically come with wrenches but i

3695.28 --> 3699.7200000000003
appreciate the gesture at least

3700.16 --> 3705.2
and hey if you're a cool guy

3702.799 --> 3708.72
i get a sense that i can trust you over

3705.2 --> 3711.68
time then i will give you a wrench

3708.72 --> 3711.68
and if you're very

3711.839 --> 3716.24
easily lashing out individual like some

3714.24 --> 3719.1189999999997
people that follow me

3716.24 --> 3721.5989999999997
then you're not gonna get a wrench

3719.119 --> 3721.599
we'll see

3722.72 --> 3726.2
hello jackson

3735.039 --> 3739.599
all right man

3737.359 --> 3741.2
this kind of looks like what's that that

3739.599 --> 3744.96
tower name again

3741.2 --> 3744.96
is it like the taipei tower

3746.079 --> 3749.52
what's it called again

3748.48 --> 3753.039
that

3749.52 --> 3756.64
is it like in dubai or something

3753.039 --> 3756.6400000000003
hey what's this

3757.2 --> 3763.5989999999997
oh man

3759.359 --> 3763.5989999999997
these magnets are like really tough

3764.16 --> 3769.5989999999997
like you have to actually really exert

3767.119 --> 3772.799
some force to get them off one way let's

3769.599 --> 3772.799
see how this works with that

3775.44 --> 3782.4
let's see there's a magnetite here

3779.2 --> 3782.3999999999996
oh what's going to happen

3785.039 --> 3793.059
that's hilarious

3787.17 --> 3793.059
[Music]

3796.96 --> 3802.039
oh

3797.76 --> 3802.039
that's too much weight for it

3810.559 --> 3815.44
let's see the other side

3812.48 --> 3816.64
yeah that works better

3815.44 --> 3819.44
dude

3816.64 --> 3819.44
what the hell

3820.0 --> 3825.039
ah

3822.16 --> 3828.5589999999997
what the [ __ ]

3825.039 --> 3831.8390000000004
okay these magnets are brittle

3828.559 --> 3836.4
the back one literally broke

3831.839 --> 3839.839
what the [ __ ] like broke into pieces

3836.4 --> 3839.839
what the hell

3842.0 --> 3849.96
what the [ __ ]

3845.28 --> 3849.96
i've never seen that happen before

3855.44 --> 3861.039
i guess i have to be kind of

3857.599 --> 3861.039
careful with that [ __ ]

3864.16 --> 3868.16
okay so these are not like things you

3866.0 --> 3870.24
want to [ __ ] around with because it can

3868.16 --> 3871.7599999999998
break apparently

3870.24 --> 3875.1189999999997
oh

3871.76 --> 3875.119
get off there damn it

3879.039 --> 3882.4
[ __ ]

3881.28 --> 3884.48
whoa

3882.4 --> 3886.1600000000003
damn it pulled it like from 10

3884.48 --> 3891.48
centimeters away

3886.16 --> 3891.48
that's these magnets are strong as [ __ ]

3903.44 --> 3905.76
god

3906.799 --> 3910.64
let's just put it back in there

3908.48 --> 3914.039
carefully

3910.64 --> 3914.0389999999998
oh man

3930.88 --> 3936.2000000000003
it is incredible how strong these things

3933.2 --> 3936.2
are

3936.24 --> 3941.2799999999997
like these things like what

3939.359 --> 3943.2799999999997
no way

3941.28 --> 3945.44
no way

3943.28 --> 3947.78
wow

3945.44 --> 3950.889
holy [ __ ]

3947.78 --> 3950.889
[Music]

3953.28 --> 3956.6400000000003
okay

3954.16 --> 3959.1189999999997
so see that little that little shard

3956.64 --> 3959.1189999999997
over there

3959.92 --> 3962.079
uh

3960.88 --> 3965.119
right

3962.079 --> 3967.119
okay now look what happens when i take

3965.119 --> 3970.4
this rod part

3967.119 --> 3973.4
and hold it over there over that thing

3970.4 --> 3973.4
look

3978.24 --> 3984.3999999999996
doing it all the way over here

3982.24 --> 3986.5589999999997
this is what i'm doing

3984.4 --> 3988.079
all the way over here see

3986.559 --> 3990.559
and that's

3988.079 --> 3990.559
literally

3991.119 --> 3993.839
what

4004.559 --> 4008.3190000000004
i've never seen anything like that

4006.16 --> 4009.5989999999997
before

4008.319 --> 4013.64
it's just

4009.599 --> 4013.6400000000003
so bizarre to see

4020.24 --> 4025.359
neodymium magnets i think they are

4022.4 --> 4025.359
steamy traveler

4025.52 --> 4031.559
that's pretty cool

4027.039 --> 4031.559
i've never had neodym demian

4036.48 --> 4041.52
but yeah that stuff is brittle man

4039.2 --> 4044.8799999999997
because that last magnet part literally

4041.52 --> 4048.2
broke it broke

4044.88 --> 4048.2000000000003
just cracked

4056.319 --> 4059.799
oh jesus

4068.4 --> 4070.88
all right

4074.96 --> 4080.559
magnets

4077.52 --> 4080.559
they did something

4085.839 --> 4090.4
so yeah thank you mark smilier for

4088.24 --> 4093.4399999999996
sending me the magnets

4090.4 --> 4096.2390000000005
to allow me to absolutely disprove your

4093.44 --> 4097.839
theory about me

4096.239 --> 4099.04
and in a way i'm actually kind of

4097.839 --> 4100.719
relieved

4099.04 --> 4103.2789999999995
because i had a whole bunch of weird

4100.719 --> 4106.4800000000005
dark whales vision [ __ ] that actually

4103.279 --> 4108.2390000000005
kind of hinted as if i had done that

4106.48 --> 4110.4
it's just that

4108.239 --> 4113.12
dark world visions especially in those

4110.4 --> 4115.5199999999995
moments are lies

4113.12 --> 4116.239
it's pure demonic nightmare to confuse

4115.52 --> 4118.799000000001
me

4116.239 --> 4120.5599999999995
and i have re started to realize that

4118.799 --> 4122.719
about it

4120.56 --> 4125.4400000000005
like years ago when i first started to

4122.719 --> 4127.359
talk about my visions

4125.44 --> 4130.799
so i already know like yeah in my

4127.359 --> 4132.4800000000005
visions i seem to there's a suggestion

4130.799 --> 4135.359
like i've done a whole bunch of things

4132.48 --> 4138.159
that i actually haven't done

4135.359 --> 4139.759
thank god for that

4138.159 --> 4142.2789999999995
right

4139.759 --> 4145.52
so yeah i definitely did not take a

4142.279 --> 4147.92
experimental early version

4145.52 --> 4149.1990000000005
of this v

4147.92 --> 4151.1990000000005
like

4149.199 --> 4153.04
what would it it would have to be like

4151.199 --> 4155.3589999999995
15 years ago or something now that

4153.04 --> 4158.29
definitely didn't happen thank god it

4155.359 --> 4161.35
didn't

4158.29 --> 4161.35
[Music]

4170.0 --> 4173.0
what

4179.44 --> 4185.2789999999995
right stephen trail yeah yeah

4181.44 --> 4185.2789999999995
yeah i know about neodymium

4185.359 --> 4191.4400000000005
natural extremely strong magnets

4189.359 --> 4192.88
like they have very fascinating

4191.44 --> 4194.48
applications

4192.88 --> 4196.159000000001
because they're so strong even when

4194.48 --> 4198.08
they're very small

4196.159 --> 4201.04
that gives it like interesting

4198.08 --> 4205.44
technological applications

4201.04 --> 4205.44
like for electronic locks i think

4212.32 --> 4215.679
and

4213.52 --> 4218.400000000001
they have properties that i don't even

4215.679 --> 4219.6
know about fully okay like

4218.4 --> 4220.32
just a

4219.6 --> 4221.84
s

4220.32 --> 4224.96
a random

4221.84 --> 4227.360000000001
thought example like maybe if you like

4224.96 --> 4229.04
put electricity through it then it will

4227.36 --> 4231.28
be demagnetized

4229.04 --> 4234.0
right until you let it go i don't know

4231.28 --> 4236.32
if it does that at all it's just that

4234.0 --> 4240.4
these types of weird

4236.32 --> 4241.199
little abilities tend to pop up

4240.4 --> 4243.28
with

4241.199 --> 4246.32
special types of metal

4243.28 --> 4247.28
odd abilities which are very useful by

4246.32 --> 4248.239
the way

4247.28 --> 4251.759999999999
right

4248.239 --> 4251.759999999999
i don't know exactly what it does

4251.92 --> 4254.88
it's just very strong

4253.84 --> 4257.88
magnet

4254.88 --> 4257.88
naturally

4276.8 --> 4283.320000000001
no

4278.64 --> 4283.320000000001
no seeking style water no you're not

4292.64 --> 4300.84
but yeah you do need to stop straw

4295.199 --> 4300.839999999999
manning against your aryan people

4301.76 --> 4306.400000000001
right

4303.36 --> 4307.28
if you really are this aryan you say you

4306.4 --> 4310.159
are

4307.28 --> 4312.88
then this type of behavior should be

4310.159 --> 4312.879999999999
below you

4312.96 --> 4317.44
so don't get all high and mighty on us

4320.0 --> 4324.239
yeah you

4321.52 --> 4325.360000000001
even if you are an aryan as you say you

4324.239 --> 4329.639999999999
are

4325.36 --> 4329.639999999999
you didn't build [ __ ]

4332.96 --> 4340.56
to say something like that is like being

4335.84 --> 4343.6
this spoiled little brat grandson

4340.56 --> 4346.56
of a legend that's like

4343.6 --> 4348.719
done incredible things and bravery and

4346.56 --> 4352.159000000001
war heroes and then you're the grandson

4348.719 --> 4353.44
like i did all that no you didn't you

4352.159 --> 4356.08
dummy

4353.44 --> 4358.08
you didn't build all that yeah even if

4356.08 --> 4360.719
you believe the aryans did and you think

4358.08 --> 4364.0
you're an area no you didn't do that

4360.719 --> 4364.0
you're just a descendant

4367.04 --> 4374.48
oh thank you for the five dollar super

4369.6 --> 4374.4800000000005
chat donation poku shell dart [ __ ]

4377.36 --> 4382.32
by the way yeah what what kind of a name

4379.44 --> 4385.04
is that is that your actual name

4382.32 --> 4388.199
or does it mean something what language

4385.04 --> 4388.199
is that

4403.199 --> 4408.879999999999
i am the keeper of my realm but thanks

4405.679 --> 4408.88
for being so racist

4409.04 --> 4412.04
uh

4412.64 --> 4415.679
although aryan is not really a race

4414.56 --> 4420.0
though

4415.679 --> 4420.0
it's more like a tribe an ancient tribe

4423.28 --> 4426.48
right

4424.56 --> 4430.4800000000005
and there's aryans all over are the

4426.48 --> 4430.48
aryan tribe roots all over the world

4434.8 --> 4439.8
coe is your name okay cool

4442.8 --> 4447.679
three favorite basketball players okay

4445.28 --> 4447.679
okay

4448.239 --> 4451.959999999999
that makes sense then

4460.92 --> 4464.069
[Music]

4499.28 --> 4503.679
native with native blood

4501.679 --> 4504.96
no french

4503.679 --> 4509.0
okay

4504.96 --> 4509.0
so are you canadian

4510.48 --> 4516.239
since you mentioned native and french

4513.36 --> 4518.159
that immediately reminds me that

4516.239 --> 4521.4
you might be canadian

4518.159 --> 4521.4
am i correct

4531.28 --> 4535.96
american

4532.96 --> 4535.96
okay

4546.64 --> 4552.4400000000005
all right so you are like in the north

4548.719 --> 4552.44
part then i guess

4554.56 --> 4558.719
do neodymium magnets lose their

4556.719 --> 4560.4
magnetism over time i have no idea

4558.719 --> 4563.8
steamy traveler

4560.4 --> 4563.799999999999
i don't know

4566.08 --> 4572.239
if i'd have to guess

4568.4 --> 4572.239
i'd say probably not

4572.8 --> 4577.84
but i'm not sure

4575.04 --> 4580.48
right other things can be magnetized

4577.84 --> 4583.12
like you can magnetize iron it has

4580.48 --> 4587.12
things like magnetite

4583.12 --> 4589.92
but neodymium is like its own element

4587.12 --> 4592.8
so if it is really that powerfully

4589.92 --> 4594.4800000000005
magnetic then i don't see how it could

4592.8 --> 4597.04
change that

4594.48 --> 4601.12
unless it literally

4597.04 --> 4601.12
transformed into another metal like

4604.08 --> 4610.32
that it had like a

4607.04 --> 4612.48
like a radioactive decay

4610.32 --> 4614.48
and then it changes slightly changes it

4612.48 --> 4616.239
slightly into another metal maybe that

4614.48 --> 4620.28
happens i don't know i don't know how

4616.239 --> 4620.28
stable the element is

4622.239 --> 4627.04
i'm already pretty proud from just

4624.32 --> 4629.44
knowing that neodymium is magnet is a

4627.04 --> 4629.44
magnet

4635.76 --> 4640.4800000000005
but this is the first time i've

4637.28 --> 4643.44
knowingly had one of them i've never had

4640.48 --> 4643.44
that before so

4646.64 --> 4652.2390000000005
drop those in in copper pi yeah yeah

4649.84 --> 4653.76
i've seen those as well yeah weird [ __ ]

4652.239 --> 4655.599999999999
man

4653.76 --> 4658.400000000001
weird

4655.6 --> 4658.400000000001
fascinating

4661.199 --> 4665.839999999999
i'm still tripping out from seeing what

4663.52 --> 4667.120000000001
i just saw that i'm just like

4665.84 --> 4668.96
magnetic

4667.12 --> 4671.199
moving a magnet

4668.96 --> 4673.04
like 20 centimeters away and you could

4671.199 --> 4675.44
just see

4673.04 --> 4677.6
this thing just spinning you you you

4675.44 --> 4679.28
that that was weird

4677.6 --> 4682.52
never seen anything like that with my

4679.28 --> 4682.5199999999995
own eyes

4696.88 --> 4699.76
really aries

4700.96 --> 4705.84
okay that is interesting

4703.44 --> 4707.04
right but yeah a story

4705.84 --> 4709.04
tradition

4707.04 --> 4710.8
in your family that's fascinating by the

4709.04 --> 4712.239
way it is i really do think that's

4710.8 --> 4714.4800000000005
fascinating

4712.239 --> 4717.04
a real family

4714.48 --> 4719.04
tradition thing that's cool you don't

4717.04 --> 4721.5199999999995
see that anymore that much

4719.04 --> 4725.28
the internet and all

4721.52 --> 4726.88
but yeah that still doesn't make you

4725.28 --> 4729.92
having done that

4726.88 --> 4729.92
it's just you

4730.4 --> 4734.719
basically

4731.76 --> 4736.64
being part of a chain of

4734.719 --> 4737.44
oral tradition

4736.64 --> 4741.280000000001
right

4737.44 --> 4743.199
that doesn't make you the actor right

4741.28 --> 4744.719
just because you know something just

4743.199 --> 4748.239
because your

4744.719 --> 4752.0
great great great great great granddaddy

4748.239 --> 4754.879999999999
did something doesn't make that you

4752.0 --> 4756.8
it was him you are you you're here

4754.88 --> 4758.96
as you in this time

4756.8 --> 4764.320000000001
with your heritage

4758.96 --> 4764.32
and it's up to you what you do right

4773.04 --> 4776.04
clutch

4777.28 --> 4779.599999999999
oh

4779.76 --> 4783.52
change the path of the modern one

4788.84 --> 4793.92
okay dude i'm sure it did

4792.159 --> 4796.4
look the aryans were extremely

4793.92 --> 4798.08
influential at the time right

4796.4 --> 4799.759999999999
but that's not

4798.08 --> 4804.88
up to

4799.76 --> 4807.84
associate with you you are

4804.88 --> 4810.8
many many generations later influenced

4807.84 --> 4812.639
by many many things in another

4810.8 --> 4814.8
celestial cycle

4812.639 --> 4817.4400000000005
so many energies are different

4814.8 --> 4818.639
that's not you

4817.44 --> 4823.12
right

4818.639 --> 4823.12
because hey by that standard i could say

4823.6 --> 4827.84
remember adam

4825.6 --> 4831.1990000000005
remember that first human

4827.84 --> 4833.12
from everything came from him well i'm

4831.199 --> 4834.08
i'm his ancestor

4833.12 --> 4837.199
i'm

4834.08 --> 4838.88
dude i am just as powerful as adam man i

4837.199 --> 4841.04
am

4838.88 --> 4841.84
i um

4841.04 --> 4844.84
yeah

4841.84 --> 4847.76
that's ridiculous isn't it isn't

4844.84 --> 4852.52
it well that's kind of like how you're

4847.76 --> 4852.52
signing right now that air is the titan

4867.199 --> 4869.599999999999
you know

4870.48 --> 4875.839999999999
family history is not

4873.76 --> 4875.84
a

4876.159 --> 4880.96
like a badge that gives you

4878.88 --> 4883.679
weight over others

4880.96 --> 4887.679
it's just something you can use to

4883.679 --> 4889.52
reflect yourself on to find more power

4887.679 --> 4892.639
in yourself

4889.52 --> 4895.6
just having it doesn't give you power it

4892.639 --> 4897.04
gives you an opportunity to attain power

4895.6 --> 4900.0
inside

4897.04 --> 4901.76
but for that you have to first

4900.0 --> 4903.28
realize that

4901.76 --> 4905.280000000001
and stop

4903.28 --> 4907.5199999999995
pulling in things

4905.28 --> 4909.679
for your own ego

4907.52 --> 4914.1990000000005
that you never did

4909.679 --> 4914.1990000000005
you as a person never did that

4925.84 --> 4930.08
your clan

4928.4 --> 4931.28
what

4930.08 --> 4935.199
uh

4931.28 --> 4935.199
clans are not aryan

4936.239 --> 4938.879999999999
what the hell

4937.679 --> 4941.1990000000005
yeah this

4938.88 --> 4945.4800000000005
guy is tripping bro

4941.199 --> 4945.48
anyway i'll be back in two minutes

5029.04 --> 5032.04
um

5045.84 --> 5050.0
he was just being broaching braveheart

5048.639 --> 5050.88
right

5050.0 --> 5052.0
because

5050.88 --> 5053.76
clans

5052.0 --> 5055.52
are not aryan

5053.76 --> 5057.280000000001
dummy

5055.52 --> 5059.76
i think you've been larping a little bit

5057.28 --> 5059.759999999999
too much

5065.84 --> 5069.88
oh my god

5093.76 --> 5096.56
all right

5094.8 --> 5101.12
yeah sure dude

5096.56 --> 5101.120000000001
i totally agree uh go goey

5101.36 --> 5105.28
joey how do you pronounce that

5108.96 --> 5112.8
right

5110.0 --> 5113.679
all that history all the tradition

5112.8 --> 5117.12
yeah

5113.679 --> 5120.0
it's something to reflect on

5117.12 --> 5124.239
it's not you though and it's not

5120.0 --> 5124.239
doesn't give you any kind of rights

5124.48 --> 5128.32
or honor

5126.32 --> 5129.84
it's just something that's good to

5128.32 --> 5131.36
reflect on

5129.84 --> 5135.96
goei okay

5131.36 --> 5135.96
okay go eat i'll take it

5148.96 --> 5151.96
ah

5170.56 --> 5174.639
aries you think so

5173.84 --> 5177.360000000001
well

5174.639 --> 5178.639
i don't think so you know why because i

5177.36 --> 5181.44
think that

5178.639 --> 5186.28
our world's realm

5181.44 --> 5186.28
was atlantis all of it

5196.4 --> 5200.719
right

5197.76 --> 5202.56
i think that what is seen as like the

5200.719 --> 5204.719
city of atlantis

5202.56 --> 5207.4400000000005
i think that might have been like the

5204.719 --> 5207.44
the giant

5208.56 --> 5214.719
the main energy system like the whole

5212.239 --> 5216.48
ring city well what if that thing was

5214.719 --> 5218.8
actually like

5216.48 --> 5221.44
the center point

5218.8 --> 5224.8
for energy transference

5221.44 --> 5225.759999999999
maybe that was the main internet hub

5224.8 --> 5229.28
let's just

5225.76 --> 5229.280000000001
put in that metaphor right

5230.8 --> 5235.1990000000005
maybe who knows man maybe they did have

5232.96 --> 5235.199
like

5235.44 --> 5239.678999999999
electric communication

5237.44 --> 5242.799999999999
even back then just not through wires

5239.679 --> 5244.639
maybe maybe they did have internet in

5242.8 --> 5245.92
their own form just not based on

5244.639 --> 5248.88
electronics

5245.92 --> 5250.88
maybe just based on wireless energy

5248.88 --> 5252.639
we don't know how can you trace that

5250.88 --> 5256.4800000000005
back

5252.639 --> 5256.4800000000005
it would just be person to person

5257.84 --> 5260.08
so

5262.32 --> 5267.679
atlantis spent the entire

5265.28 --> 5270.4
known realms that's what i think and

5267.679 --> 5272.4800000000005
maybe beyond maybe the the lands beyond

5270.4 --> 5274.08
as well

5272.48 --> 5276.718999999999
this is everywhere where there's

5274.08 --> 5278.159
pyramids

5276.719 --> 5279.6
there is

5278.159 --> 5283.44
atlantis

5279.6 --> 5283.4400000000005
it's all atlantean technology

5284.88 --> 5289.12
going on two hours

5287.12 --> 5291.04
thanks amanda young for the five dollars

5289.12 --> 5294.8
of chat donation

5291.04 --> 5296.8
two hours now i started late anyway

5294.8 --> 5299.52
but yeah now that it's going i'm just

5296.8 --> 5301.76
hanging in there

5299.52 --> 5301.76
got

5301.92 --> 5304.96
the magnets

5306.159 --> 5312.96
it's pretty cool though i do a genuinely

5308.88 --> 5315.4400000000005
thank mark smylier for sending me them

5312.96 --> 5318.08
and i really really hope that now he can

5315.44 --> 5320.48
finally let his silly conspiracy theory

5318.08 --> 5321.6
about me the rest

5320.48 --> 5325.678999999999
because i

5321.6 --> 5328.08
demonstrated that it's not true

5325.679 --> 5329.52
he said that oh just stick these magnets

5328.08 --> 5331.76
on you and it's

5329.52 --> 5334.88
and you'll see that you've been vexed

5331.76 --> 5337.84
that's what he said it's like no

5334.88 --> 5337.84
no

5347.04 --> 5350.96
culturalist marxist

5349.199 --> 5354.638999999999
whitney

5350.96 --> 5354.639
what do you mean which whitney

5355.199 --> 5359.879999999999
i mean like whitney houston or something

5366.159 --> 5370.92
require yeah i'm aquarius too

5412.56 --> 5417.88
ew

5413.92 --> 5417.88
you're a creep aries

5421.199 --> 5427.759999999999
that's creepy that you even

5423.679 --> 5430.159
like to brag about that that is

5427.76 --> 5430.159000000001
creepy

5432.96 --> 5441.199
right and by the way

5435.679 --> 5443.36
you can do that with dark brown eyes too

5441.199 --> 5446.5599999999995
it's not really about the eyes it's

5443.36 --> 5447.5199999999995
about the spirit

5446.56 --> 5449.679
right

5447.52 --> 5452.400000000001
you can have all the blue eyes in the

5449.679 --> 5453.36
world or all the deep brown eyes in the

5452.4 --> 5456.879999999999
world

5453.36 --> 5459.759999999999
if you're a weak [ __ ]

5456.88 --> 5461.76
that will radiate off you

5459.76 --> 5464.56
now if somebody's going to be hypnotized

5461.76 --> 5467.76
by a weak [ __ ]

5464.56 --> 5470.2390000000005
then yeah that'll work but

5467.76 --> 5473.280000000001
if they're actually going after like a

5470.239 --> 5475.44
sense of confidence

5473.28 --> 5477.92
then that's not going to work no matter

5475.44 --> 5481.159
how beautifully blue your eyes are or

5477.92 --> 5481.159
deep brown

5492.4 --> 5497.08
yeah february 6th that's right

5526.639 --> 5529.92
a party trick

5530.159 --> 5533.159
wow

5538.56 --> 5544.080000000001
so i guess

5540.48 --> 5547.839999999999
you're a magician aries the titan

5544.08 --> 5547.84
knowing party tricks

5550.32 --> 5554.5199999999995
you do card tricks too

5576.08 --> 5580.8
equators are good people most of the

5578.48 --> 5585.159
time emmanuel and there's when there's a

5580.8 --> 5585.159000000001
bad one you got a problem though

5603.28 --> 5607.679
you can juggle that you're only trick

5604.88 --> 5607.679
hey that's cool

5609.12 --> 5615.159
dude i can do all kinds of tricks i just

5611.84 --> 5615.159000000001
learned that

5616.8 --> 5620.320000000001
just don't use it

5618.639 --> 5622.8
it's like

5620.32 --> 5626.08
magic

5622.8 --> 5628.320000000001
the best way to apply magic is to not

5626.08 --> 5631.36
use it

5628.32 --> 5633.199
and only when the moment calls

5631.36 --> 5636.639
specifically when it's actually

5633.199 --> 5639.12
important that's when

5636.639 --> 5640.56
the abilities come out it's the yoda

5639.12 --> 5643.36
effect

5640.56 --> 5644.4800000000005
right i'm using that example or that

5643.36 --> 5646.639
metaphor

5644.48 --> 5648.4
because people actually get that right

5646.639 --> 5650.159000000001
yoda

5648.4 --> 5652.48
fragile little

5650.159 --> 5653.5199999999995
old man alien

5652.48 --> 5656.0
but then

5653.52 --> 5658.96
when [ __ ] hits the fans suddenly springs

5656.0 --> 5661.679
into action into this versatile agile

5658.96 --> 5663.52
bouncy ball

5661.679 --> 5665.52
wizard fighter right

5663.52 --> 5667.76
it's that effect that's how you should

5665.52 --> 5670.88
actually use power

5667.76 --> 5673.84
because if you're gonna use party tricks

5670.88 --> 5673.84
that's

5676.48 --> 5680.48
it's not going to be good

5678.4 --> 5682.74
but anyway whatever man

5680.48 --> 5685.849999999999
not trying to

5682.74 --> 5685.849999999999
[Music]

5699.36 --> 5704.08
yep emmanuel yes they can i know

5705.36 --> 5711.719
i can be brutal

5707.84 --> 5711.719
try not to be though

5730.159 --> 5734.799999999999
all right anyway it's

5732.0 --> 5736.84
it's all fine if every

5734.8 --> 5740.2390000000005
wants to live in a

5736.84 --> 5740.2390000000005
semi-magical dream

5741.36 --> 5746.239
and it's in the family to do that then

5743.76 --> 5747.679
who are we to disrupt that tradition

5746.239 --> 5748.959999999999
right

5747.679 --> 5751.4400000000005
but

5748.96 --> 5752.719
we're not gonna fall for it though

5751.44 --> 5754.96
right

5752.719 --> 5756.88
you can believe that

5754.96 --> 5757.84
you can hang all this

5756.88 --> 5759.92
weight

5757.84 --> 5764.52
onto it

5759.92 --> 5764.52
that is not going to impress us

5781.28 --> 5784.28
hmm

5788.4 --> 5791.599999999999
right but hey

5789.84 --> 5794.2390000000005
dude i compare

5791.6 --> 5796.4800000000005
almost everything to dungeons and

5794.239 --> 5799.678999999999
dragons and that includes all the forms

5796.48 --> 5801.5199999999995
of magic and trickery and everything

5799.679 --> 5803.6
it's all in there everything is in there

5801.52 --> 5807.360000000001
everything everything you could ever

5803.6 --> 5807.360000000001
conceive of is in there

5807.44 --> 5810.0
the spell

5810.159 --> 5816.239
all the spell schools

5813.28 --> 5816.239
so i get that

5823.04 --> 5828.159
i'm enchanted

5825.04 --> 5830.32
give me a break dude you cannot overcome

5828.159 --> 5833.28
my spell resistance

5830.32 --> 5834.719
don't kid yourself

5833.28 --> 5836.639
like if you're gonna cause some

5834.719 --> 5839.44
enchantment spell

5836.639 --> 5841.36
yeah you might be susceptible to that

5839.44 --> 5843.36
and believe it and that might even

5841.36 --> 5845.44
halfway reinforce the notion that it

5843.36 --> 5847.599999999999
could be real right for those that are

5845.44 --> 5851.799999999999
slightly less vulnerable

5847.6 --> 5851.8
it's not going to work on me though

5860.159 --> 5864.638999999999
all right clutch bear see you later
