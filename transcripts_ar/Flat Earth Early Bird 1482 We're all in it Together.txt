thank you

so please keep it coming right yeah the

128.16 --> 132.35999999999999
weather today is kind of a bit bizarre

130.319 --> 134.879
it's like

132.36 --> 137.459
one moment it's

134.879 --> 139.2
clouded and raining and then it's like

137.459 --> 142.68
this again so

139.2 --> 145.2
wind is blowing up there pretty fast

142.68 --> 148.94
and carrying clouds with rain and then

145.2 --> 148.94
it's a piece of clear sky and sun

150.0 --> 155.459
like this

152.16 --> 159.739
and then it's like quickly gone again

155.459 --> 159.739
but yes interesting weather

160.68 --> 163.62
at least it's not like raining

162.3 --> 166.019
continually

163.62 --> 168.56
that's something

166.019 --> 168.56
right

170.83 --> 174.03900000000002
[Music]

178.44 --> 182.22
so

179.76 --> 186.56
hello Nathan R first in chat good to see

182.22 --> 186.56
you Captain Caveman huh

188.04 --> 195.959
what are you doing

189.48 --> 195.959
it is Sunday the 15th of January 2023

197.819 --> 200.54
wait a month

202.739 --> 208.98000000000002
and yeah I'm doing pretty good

205.98 --> 213.5
as I said I would didn't get any beers

208.98 --> 213.5
yesterday and I feel great this morning

214.319 --> 219.319
so I think I'm gonna actually stick to

217.08 --> 219.31900000000002
this

231.299 --> 235.739
yeah

232.62 --> 238.5
because overall yesterday I was just the

235.739 --> 241.019
entire evening able to

238.5 --> 242.94
pay attention to whatever I was doing a

241.019 --> 245.81900000000002
lot more

242.94 --> 247.62
so I'm just noticing like I had more

245.819 --> 251.04
capacity

247.62 --> 254.04
and yeah I cannot deny the

251.04 --> 255.72
advantage of that which is kind of what

254.04 --> 258.71999999999997
I need

255.72 --> 258.72
so

259.26 --> 265.94
yeah I'm gonna stick to that

262.8 --> 265.94
no more beers

268.08 --> 272.69899999999996
and we'll see what happens

270.72 --> 274.97900000000004
I mean this is technically still

272.699 --> 277.199
preliminary I don't know maybe like in a

274.979 --> 278.639
week I'll start to feel like oh I really

277.199 --> 281.88
need it or something I don't know if

278.639 --> 284.22
that's gonna happen we'll see

281.88 --> 286.979
you know I have no guarantees on what's

284.22 --> 289.08000000000004
gonna happen but from the preliminaries

286.979 --> 291.06
it sounds like a very good idea for me

289.08 --> 293.82
to just stop

291.06 --> 295.38
because I got more available to me and I

293.82 --> 298.02
can do more with it

295.38 --> 300.65999999999997
in the past and I'm talking like 20

298.02 --> 301.5
years ago and such a lot of times I

300.66 --> 303.90000000000003
would

301.5 --> 305.759
drink

303.9 --> 307.44
especially drink

305.759 --> 311.28000000000003
kind of because

307.44 --> 313.259
if I didn't I had all like this energy

311.28 --> 315.96
yet no grip

313.259 --> 318.72
on the world and it was really painful

315.96 --> 321.59999999999997
and embarrassing to me is like feeling

318.72 --> 322.97900000000004
like wow I can do anything but I can't

321.6 --> 325.759
do anything

322.979 --> 325.75899999999996
terrible

326.52 --> 329.69899999999996
just

327.66 --> 331.62
couldn't do it like the only thing I

329.699 --> 334.16
could do was just like degrade myself

331.62 --> 334.16
with it

334.32 --> 338.58
out there

335.88 --> 340.5
nobody would want to accept me in that

338.58 --> 342.3
state

340.5 --> 344.88
everybody would just get jealous and

342.3 --> 347.66
embarrassed and they were that did

344.88 --> 347.65999999999997
actually happen

348.3 --> 351.32
it's annoying

351.479 --> 356.639
right or they would think I was arrogant

353.58 --> 359.039
and in a way I was because I was just

356.639 --> 362.82
very confident about myself even though

359.039 --> 365.0
I did not base that confidence on having

362.82 --> 368.419
all this

365.0 --> 368.419
accomplishments out there

368.82 --> 373.4
I based it on the accomplishment in here

373.56 --> 378.9
right but then yeah that didn't work so

376.44 --> 381.78
a lot of times I would drink

378.9 --> 385.02
so I would become more preoccupied with

381.78 --> 387.65999999999997
the well results of that

385.02 --> 389.21999999999997
so I'd have something more close at home

387.66 --> 391.62
to worry about

389.22 --> 393.36
instead of just facing the embarrassment

391.62 --> 395.6
that I couldn't do anything with my

393.36 --> 398.639
skill

395.6 --> 400.86
I'm in my scale with my talent you could

398.639 --> 403.259
say it wasn't a skill yet if it was then

400.86 --> 405.47900000000004
it could do something with it right

403.259 --> 406.5
the only real skills I had at the time

405.479 --> 408.65999999999997
was

406.5 --> 409.59
figuring out stuff

408.66 --> 412.97900000000004
and like

409.59 --> 414.479
[Music]

412.979 --> 416.639
right yeah

414.479 --> 419.34
but I did

416.639 --> 422.46000000000004
productively with all that time

419.34 --> 425.4
basically was right stuff like I made my

422.46 --> 429.18
websited and I did some goldsmithing and

425.4 --> 432.17999999999995
some designing on that and

429.18 --> 435.479
then started writing a DND technical

432.18 --> 439.139
rule book right which like do you have

435.479 --> 442.08
no idea how unimaginably complicated

439.139 --> 445.08
that really is the oversight part I mean

442.08 --> 447.35999999999996
just read it just read some of the pages

445.08 --> 449.52
there and you already see just because

447.36 --> 452.699
of the structure of it if you have the

449.52 --> 453.599
talent the spot that that it's like holy

452.699 --> 457.199
[ __ ]

453.599 --> 458.819
yeah I did absolutely like write every

457.199 --> 461.3
piece of that

458.819 --> 466.22
oops

461.3 --> 469.8
I basically designed a way of writing it

466.22 --> 474.44000000000005
or rather took good designs that were

469.8 --> 474.44
already present and then perfected them

474.78 --> 480.479
based on like yeah the standard DND Rule

478.38 --> 483.12
books and how they describe things which

480.479 --> 484.74
had a point to it only it was sometimes

483.12 --> 487.68
it just

484.74 --> 490.74
would be different for no reason and it

487.68 --> 493.38
was made it less cohesive

490.74 --> 494.88
so that's yeah anyway I spend a lot of

493.38 --> 497.36
time on that but yeah nobody gives a

494.88 --> 500.21999999999997
[ __ ] out there right I mean literally

497.36 --> 501.72
what do people care about

500.22 --> 504.41900000000004
that they're gonna have trouble

501.72 --> 508.46000000000004
understanding so but I still thought

504.419 --> 508.46
like yeah but I am really smart

509.94 --> 514.14
anyway

511.979 --> 516.539
now

514.14 --> 520.3199999999999
in this time

516.539 --> 522.7189999999999
now I can finally apply

520.32 --> 524.399
my talent through the skill that I've

522.719 --> 527.279
built

524.399 --> 528.54
so now technically based on this

527.279 --> 530.82
reasoning

528.54 --> 533.3
the original reason why I started

530.82 --> 534.98
drinking has been negated

533.3 --> 537.779
[Music]

534.98 --> 539.7
that routine of suppressing so I

537.779 --> 542.459
wouldn't be so embarrassed

539.7 --> 545.839
about where I was at

542.459 --> 545.8389999999999
doesn't apply anymore

547.26 --> 552.3
and so I can just let it go it's not

550.019 --> 554.04
like oh I have to stop drinking oh why

552.3 --> 558.3
do I want to keep going back right no no

554.04 --> 561.5999999999999
no no no because the reason

558.3 --> 564.14
the reason why I did that

561.6 --> 564.14
and

566.58 --> 569.779
isn't that interesting

571.16 --> 575.1
drinking spirit's not good for the

573.48 --> 577.32
spirit

575.1 --> 578.88
well it did help me through some rough

577.32 --> 581.6400000000001
times

578.88 --> 582.779
to be fair where I was absolutely that

581.64 --> 585.36
stuck

582.779 --> 589.5
and I would have like tortured myself

585.36 --> 592.22
over that if I wasn't drinking I would I

589.5 --> 595.32
would I was like

592.22 --> 599.0
really hurts

595.32 --> 599.0
by my inabilities

602.22 --> 606.3000000000001
and alcohol just made it a bit easier

604.8 --> 608.6999999999999
it's just like okay well it doesn't

606.3 --> 611.519
matter as much anymore like yeah it's

608.7 --> 614.58
screwed but let's just see what you can

611.519 --> 616.68
make with what you got left

614.58 --> 618.5400000000001
and then you don't have all that weight

616.68 --> 620.519
on it

618.54 --> 623.519
now not that I was like drunk all the

620.519 --> 627.0
time but even just with the regular like

623.519 --> 629.16
drinking One Moment in a day

627.0 --> 631.88
then still like that influences

629.16 --> 631.88
everything else

636.3 --> 638.8389999999999
anyway

639.94 --> 645.1800000000001
[Music]

643.019 --> 645.95
so it did definitely serve a function

645.18 --> 648.4799999999999
and I mean

645.95 --> 652.4590000000001
[Music]

648.48 --> 652.4590000000001
it really was out of pragmatism

655.56 --> 662.399
because I needed to prevent myself from

658.44 --> 666.7790000000001
getting emotionally hurt all the time

662.399 --> 668.7
I mean I might have become like suicidal

666.779 --> 672.3
if I hadn't

668.7 --> 674.839
just taking a beer and basically take a

672.3 --> 674.8389999999999
step down

677.579 --> 681.4399999999999
because I couldn't do anything with it

684.12 --> 689.399
it's the frustration anyway

687.42 --> 691.019
it's different now

689.399 --> 693.0
so yeah I thought that was an

691.019 --> 695.54
interesting point to make at the start

693.0 --> 695.54
of my show

696.12 --> 700.98
right

698.32 --> 703.38
[Music]

700.98 --> 705.36
feels so much more focused it's really

703.38 --> 707.64
remarkable

705.36 --> 710.519
also still not drinking green tea and

707.64 --> 713.519
I'm not even missing it that much

710.519 --> 715.68
so I I I'm gonna do this I'm gonna stop

713.519 --> 718.38
drinking beers and I'm gonna just drink

715.68 --> 720.8389999999999
mint tea from now on

718.38 --> 723.06
it'll save me cause I've actually even

720.839 --> 724.86
like with the smoking of cannabis which

723.06 --> 727.3199999999999
I do still do

724.86 --> 732.32
I smoke less

727.32 --> 732.32
I I measured it it's like what

732.839 --> 738.24
this is going to turn out to be the best

736.079 --> 741.7199999999999
decision ever this year

738.24 --> 744.44
this is my New Year's resolution

741.72 --> 744.44
for myself

748.26 --> 754.8
I'm a bit late I guess but yeah

752.22 --> 757.9200000000001
better late than never I mean you could

754.8 --> 760.68
say I'm 20 years late but yeah

757.92 --> 763.68
better late than never

760.68 --> 763.68
anyway

765.36 --> 769.0790000000001
doesn't have to be the main subject of

767.519 --> 772.62
what we're talking about here I don't

769.079 --> 775.68
want to talk about I mean yeah

772.62 --> 778.019
alcohol the influence but I just wanted

775.68 --> 780.779
to highlight this specifically because

778.019 --> 783.48
it applies to me and I'm going through

780.779 --> 785.519
it I'm basically here part of the open

783.48 --> 787.86
experiment

785.519 --> 790.74
of just showing my life and what I'm

787.86 --> 792.839
going through and this is part of it

790.74 --> 795.12
right hey Michael Com

792.839 --> 796.62
are you doing Michael Khan got a strike

795.12 --> 798.54
again

796.62 --> 802.1
uh

798.54 --> 802.0999999999999
from an anti-flat earther

802.68 --> 807.2399999999999
they always pick on you don't they but

805.44 --> 809.899
then again you do kind of pick on them

807.24 --> 809.899
too so

814.92 --> 819.5999999999999
but yeah arguably they deserve that but

818.399 --> 822.0
still

819.6 --> 824.7
triggered Ballers yeah yeah

822.0 --> 826.98
right anyway uh yeah yes they've been

824.7 --> 828.0300000000001
watching a whole bunch of movies

826.98 --> 829.6800000000001
uh

828.03 --> 833.519
[Music]

829.68 --> 834.4799999999999
and of course at the end very late Jim

833.519 --> 837.6
Bob

834.48 --> 839.22
and Posh had a debate against Nathan

837.6 --> 840.839
Thompson and some other guy don't

839.22 --> 845.519
recognize

840.839 --> 849.7790000000001
about veganism and it got all biblical

845.519 --> 852.42
and really biblical and philosophical it

849.779 --> 855.6
was quite intriguing actually

852.42 --> 857.959
and Nathan Thompson was just very Nathan

855.6 --> 857.9590000000001
Thompson

858.12 --> 862.86
straw Manning shock jockey is what I

860.82 --> 865.0790000000001
called it this is what he does and he

862.86 --> 867.48
always does that and he's he's kind of

865.079 --> 870.2399999999999
effective at it

867.48 --> 872.279
from that perspective

870.24 --> 874.92
but yeah it looks it does look

872.279 --> 880.199
ridiculous in the face of like what Jim

874.92 --> 882.06
Bob put down we'll stay like really like

880.199 --> 885.199
perfectly sewing

882.06 --> 885.199
it's very impressive

885.66 --> 891.8389999999999
veganism but yeah dude dude just watch

889.38 --> 893.3389999999999
watch that debate they go through a lot

891.839 --> 896.0400000000001
of it

893.339 --> 898.94
in fact I'll link it up if you haven't

896.04 --> 898.9399999999999
actually watched it

904.519 --> 908.839
oh wait that's not the one

913.32 --> 921.0600000000001
this is the one it's yeah it's almost

916.5 --> 924.26
four hours the three and a half hours so

921.06 --> 924.26
it's a big chunk

926.22 --> 932.5790000000001
I was commenting about yeah on on their

929.76 --> 934.139
like until halfway I didn't I only

932.579 --> 935.8199999999999
watched the first half because it was

934.139 --> 939.92
freaking in the middle of the night

935.82 --> 939.9200000000001
I have to go to bed sometime

940.62 --> 946.019
which by the way I feel remarkably

943.139 --> 948.12
little burden over I literally went to

946.019 --> 953.36
bed four o'clock and I feel this good

948.12 --> 953.36
like bro bro there's

953.88 --> 958.32
it's

955.68 --> 962.04
like

958.32 --> 965.1600000000001
another world to me this

962.04 --> 968.459
because every time in the last few years

965.16 --> 971.9399999999999
if I go to bed like four o'clock I would

968.459 --> 974.04
feel kind of wonky in the morning

971.94 --> 977.399
even though the beer that I would be

974.04 --> 978.779
drinking would be like 12 hours before

977.399 --> 980.399
that

978.779 --> 982.98
literally

980.399 --> 985.74
like way before that and and out of my

982.98 --> 987.4200000000001
system and then still the combination of

985.74 --> 991.44
that would make me feel wonky in the

987.42 --> 994.399
morning it doesn't now at all

991.44 --> 994.399
whoa

996.24 --> 1000.73
[Music]

1000.98 --> 1003.639
whoa it's itching

1007.04 --> 1009.759
okay

1014.06 --> 1019.3389999999999
sounds a bit weird maybe but have you

1015.98 --> 1021.88
like tried oiling it up with coconut oil

1019.339 --> 1021.8800000000001
or something

1027.319 --> 1032.959
and yeah besides like

1030.439 --> 1034.3390000000002
with itches I have issues with the two

1032.959 --> 1037.04
sometimes you used to have a lot more

1034.339 --> 1039.799
because of what I eat

1037.04 --> 1043.339
when I was younger now I don't as much

1039.799 --> 1048.319
but still like once it gets going it is

1043.339 --> 1050.36
like part body situation and part mental

1048.319 --> 1052.82
triggering process just kind of like

1050.36 --> 1054.86
sneezing is in a way right

1052.82 --> 1057.039
you got to remember that like once you

1054.86 --> 1060.5
start to think of it

1057.039 --> 1063.08
then like your entire body just is like

1060.5 --> 1066.14
oh we want a scratch routine too why

1063.08 --> 1067.9399999999998
because it makes the blood flow so it

1066.14 --> 1072.46
can be good but not if it doesn't go

1067.94 --> 1072.46
away then because of your skin condition

1074.24 --> 1077.86
so I'll go ahead and Skype right

1078.32 --> 1081.1
indeed

1086.059 --> 1090.28
but yeah

1087.62 --> 1090.28
diet

1091.4 --> 1096.3200000000002
or yeah as we spoke about but also

1094.28 --> 1099.18
coconut oil

1096.32 --> 1103.039
it really does help

1099.18 --> 1108.16
[Music]

1103.039 --> 1108.16
right it's it's just like coconut fat

1110.419 --> 1115.2800000000002
the denature I saw you don't smell it

1112.94 --> 1117.98
unless you like that unless you like

1115.28 --> 1120.3999999999999
smelling like coconut but

1117.98 --> 1120.4
anyway

1120.5 --> 1127.299
hey LSG Jason Brown

1124.46 --> 1127.299
good to see you

1134.179 --> 1140.299
give anything a go it's okay okay well

1138.62 --> 1143.78
again

1140.299 --> 1147.94
try something similar to what I have and

1143.78 --> 1147.94
get rid of all forms of caffeine

1148.64 --> 1152.419
now coffee

1150.14 --> 1154.64
no tea

1152.419 --> 1158.9
no

1154.64 --> 1161.24
caffeine in things like Cola like avoid

1158.9 --> 1162.8600000000001
it all together for a while you'll be

1161.24 --> 1164.539
surprised

1162.86 --> 1166.1599999999999
but that's part of it because those are

1164.539 --> 1167.9
the things that typically hang around

1166.16 --> 1170.96
the longest I mean when you go for

1167.9 --> 1174.26
careful diet you already start to

1170.96 --> 1177.28
step away from things like MSG which is

1174.26 --> 1177.28
also an influence

1178.28 --> 1181.059
a bad one

1181.88 --> 1184.3600000000001
right

1185.36 --> 1189.9799999999998
but caffeine

1188.299 --> 1192.679
in all forms

1189.98 --> 1195.919
does have an influence

1192.679 --> 1199.039
I mean literally if I like check this

1195.919 --> 1201.919
like this is a miracle to me guys

1199.039 --> 1203.66
look look at this look at my shoulder or

1201.919 --> 1207.7990000000002
my elbow

1203.66 --> 1208.88
see yeah look how incredibly good that

1207.799 --> 1212.4189999999999
looks

1208.88 --> 1213.74
compared to like yeah it's a bit colored

1212.419 --> 1214.94
and [ __ ]

1213.74 --> 1216.86
but

1214.94 --> 1220.4
this

1216.86 --> 1222.08
that that was a lot worse

1220.4 --> 1223.8200000000002
for

1222.08 --> 1227.02
what is it

1223.82 --> 1227.02
four years or something

1232.1 --> 1236.36
my skin is in great condition actually

1235.52 --> 1239.12
foreign

1236.36 --> 1241.58
you do take a lot of caffeine well there

1239.12 --> 1243.1999999999998
you go buddy

1241.58 --> 1245.6
it's going to be tough

1243.2 --> 1248.6000000000001
caffeine like if if you take a lot of it

1245.6 --> 1251.3799999999999
that's a very tough addiction

1248.6 --> 1251.3799999999999
arguably

1251.66 --> 1255.3400000000001
yeah

1252.799 --> 1255.34
but

1255.5 --> 1258.76
it's going to be part of it

1261.5 --> 1266.0
right

1262.76 --> 1268.28
but look look at how long it's taken me

1266.0 --> 1270.44
to even like step away because I've

1268.28 --> 1272.36
drank coffee remember to mirror coffee

1270.44 --> 1275.059
at the early bird show that's what I

1272.36 --> 1277.82
used to drink every time

1275.059 --> 1281.539
then I couldn't take it anymore

1277.82 --> 1284.96
and they just stuck to green tea only

1281.539 --> 1286.82
and now that has become even a bit of a

1284.96 --> 1291.159
burden even though that's much less

1286.82 --> 1291.1589999999999
harmful than coffee in my opinion

1295.34 --> 1302.4189999999999
right so so cut it step by step

1300.26 --> 1304.1589999999999
you can't just say boom no more coffee

1302.419 --> 1306.7990000000002
all of a sudden dude you're gonna get

1304.159 --> 1309.98
shakes and [ __ ] right you gotta build it

1306.799 --> 1312.74
down just build it down and be aware of

1309.98 --> 1315.02
it start to become aware of like your

1312.74 --> 1317.559
habit of doing it and how you arrange it

1315.02 --> 1317.559
in your day

1317.78 --> 1323.539
start with that and then carefully build

1320.539 --> 1325.7
it down also start to pay attention to

1323.539 --> 1328.64
symptoms

1325.7 --> 1330.74
versus when you drink the coffee be very

1328.64 --> 1333.0200000000002
careful like you have to basically start

1330.74 --> 1335.0
start studying yourself medically like

1333.02 --> 1337.6
that

1335.0 --> 1337.6
if you do that

1338.24 --> 1343.84
I guarantee you you're you're gonna

1340.299 --> 1343.84
develop out of it

1350.059 --> 1353.84
uh he's taking star water

1351.62 --> 1357.039
[Music]

1353.84 --> 1357.039
and Amanda you

1367.96 --> 1372.22
colloid me what

1372.32 --> 1375.22
what is that

1377.96 --> 1383.24
what

1379.94 --> 1385.6000000000001
how can you have colloidal oatmeal what

1383.24 --> 1385.6
the hell

1387.5 --> 1390.4
okay

1393.26 --> 1398.299
that is so bizarre that is something

1395.48 --> 1399.679
that you would find isn't it seeking

1398.299 --> 1402.4
style water

1399.679 --> 1405.919
colloid what

1402.4 --> 1408.14
okay interesting never heard of that

1405.919 --> 1408.75
that sounds really funny to me by the

1408.14 --> 1411.8190000000002
way

1408.75 --> 1411.819
[Music]

1414.32 --> 1420.74
so it's like fine powdered oatmeal

1417.5 --> 1422.059
like really fine powder that's really

1420.74 --> 1424.22
weird

1422.059 --> 1427.94
but funny

1424.22 --> 1429.5
and well cool if it really works never

1427.94 --> 1431.78
heard of it

1429.5 --> 1433.76
right so yeah Michael come you could

1431.78 --> 1436.1789999999999
perhaps try that

1433.76 --> 1436.179
do

1437.24 --> 1440.2
on the short run

1440.419 --> 1445.8200000000002
but I'd still go for like at least the

1443.659 --> 1447.5590000000002
studying of your own coffee habits and

1445.82 --> 1451.48
all that

1447.559 --> 1451.48
I I do that no matter what

1451.76 --> 1458.0
right to see like if it because with me

1455.059 --> 1460.6399999999999
the coffee how I how I stopped drinking

1458.0 --> 1463.28
coffee is by noticing a cuteness the

1460.64 --> 1467.0
acuteness of drinking coffee and like

1463.28 --> 1469.36
within 15 minutes I get like this itch

1467.0 --> 1469.36
Rush

1473.059 --> 1478.22
very now I have the discipline but I

1476.24 --> 1480.98
don't recommend it necessary this is my

1478.22 --> 1483.08
particular talent I guess that I can

1480.98 --> 1486.679
literally ignore it in the same way that

1483.08 --> 1489.26
I can prevent myself from coughing

1486.679 --> 1492.6200000000001
like I don't need to cough

1489.26 --> 1495.02
like even that's why I don't have a lot

1492.62 --> 1497.36
of throat issues anymore

1495.02 --> 1499.22
and when I get sick it's usually just

1497.36 --> 1502.039
sneezing and never my throat anymore

1499.22 --> 1504.6200000000001
despite me being a smoker

1502.039 --> 1507.02
is because of discipline and the same

1504.62 --> 1509.1789999999999
way I could basically ignore the itch

1507.02 --> 1512.179
rushes and all that that I did get from

1509.179 --> 1514.7800000000002
the coffee but at the last Parts it got

1512.179 --> 1514.7800000000002
so bad

1515.299 --> 1519.44
that even with the discipline I couldn't

1517.4 --> 1520.88
suppress it anymore and that was really

1519.44 --> 1522.919
because of the coffee and the weird

1520.88 --> 1524.24
thing is even in the past that had

1522.919 --> 1527.2990000000002
happened

1524.24 --> 1529.159
but then it would go away again

1527.299 --> 1531.08
and I would just continue what I would

1529.159 --> 1533.8400000000001
do

1531.08 --> 1535.9399999999998
but like in the period I stopped

1533.84 --> 1538.58
drinking coffee I couldn't it wouldn't

1535.94 --> 1541.22
go it would happen every single time in

1538.58 --> 1545.26
the at the end

1541.22 --> 1545.26
you smoke too could that be a factor

1553.48 --> 1557.6200000000001
not sure maybe

1558.2 --> 1564.44
I mean smoking tobaccos is not good for

1561.799 --> 1566.779
your skin overall like it's not gonna

1564.44 --> 1569.299
help it but I don't know if that's

1566.779 --> 1570.62
directly connected to like itchy rushes

1569.299 --> 1573.58
and all that

1570.62 --> 1573.58
I don't think so

1579.44 --> 1586.64
I really think it's the caffeine

1581.9 --> 1590.179
that's what I got out of my experience

1586.64 --> 1593.0590000000002
and by the way it's all on cap I I

1590.179 --> 1595.64
talked about this stuff in the last few

1593.059 --> 1598.22
years like this is the knowledge I

1595.64 --> 1600.98
gather by just oh orange talking about

1598.22 --> 1602.659
his conditions again oh yeah yeah well

1600.98 --> 1606.2
it's actually a log it's a medical

1602.659 --> 1609.39
journal in that sense

1606.2 --> 1611.179
and look at what I've learned from it

1609.39 --> 1613.3400000000001
[Music]

1611.179 --> 1614.539
do you shower before bed

1613.34 --> 1618.33
what

1614.539 --> 1621.44
no I don't but I wash my feet

1618.33 --> 1621.4399999999998
[Music]

1634.58 --> 1641.24
yeah wow if it's that bad dude if if

1637.76 --> 1644.059
it's that bad Mike will come you really

1641.24 --> 1647.779
gotta stop cut down on the coffee

1644.059 --> 1650.059
prompt I mean serious if it's that bad

1647.779 --> 1651.559
that you you don't even like water on

1650.059 --> 1655.3999999999999
your skin

1651.559 --> 1659.1789999999999
you gotta stop the coffee quick

1655.4 --> 1662.8400000000001
well still probably build it down but

1659.179 --> 1665.6000000000001
once you catch on that it's acute

1662.84 --> 1667.1589999999999
you gotta go for it if if you're if it's

1665.6 --> 1669.559
that bad man

1667.159 --> 1673.0390000000002
dude

1669.559 --> 1675.3799999999999
it is okay then yeah then take the

1673.039 --> 1676.0
advice even more seriously that I gave

1675.38 --> 1678.74
you

1676.0 --> 1681.44
[Music]

1678.74 --> 1683.919
what shower make anyone itchy it doesn't

1681.44 --> 1683.919
with me

1686.6 --> 1694.539
in the past it has like but that's like

1689.539 --> 1694.539
in my teens when I was still eating like

1695.14 --> 1701.0590000000002
mainstream paprika chips

1698.14 --> 1703.46
with all the MSG and all that when I was

1701.059 --> 1707.059
still doing all that yeah then sometimes

1703.46 --> 1710.44
showers could be super itchy but I

1707.059 --> 1710.44
haven't had that since my teens

1713.539 --> 1716.3799999999999
foreign

1716.48 --> 1722.299
but I don't shower that much I wash my

1719.48 --> 1725.6
feet every night that way

1722.299 --> 1727.34
I still get to basically have an extra

1725.6 --> 1730.2199999999998
cleansing

1727.34 --> 1732.5
because when you I condition my to wash

1730.22 --> 1736.58
my feet and what happens then is that

1732.5 --> 1741.2
those feet become dumping grounds they

1736.58 --> 1743.96
your body anticipates like oh that time

1741.2 --> 1746.74
of the day there's an opportunity to

1743.96 --> 1746.74
dump some stuff

1747.62 --> 1753.7399999999998
there on that location with the feet not

1750.919 --> 1757.1000000000001
the rest of the body but the feet and

1753.74 --> 1762.02
you have conditioned that since my teens

1757.1 --> 1764.4189999999999
and it works amazingly but yeah that's

1762.02 --> 1765.76
done that for a very long time

1764.419 --> 1769.179
yeah

1765.76 --> 1769.179
oh my God

1775.82 --> 1780.34
bro

1777.559 --> 1780.34
row

1783.02 --> 1788.02
hasn't your doctor told you to stop

1785.299 --> 1788.02
drinking coffee

1789.38 --> 1794.0800000000002
I mean if you even

1791.539 --> 1794.08
oh

1799.1 --> 1804.02
yeah

1801.559 --> 1806.24
there's your problem no no but George

1804.02 --> 1808.399
Sanford if he's taking that that means

1806.24 --> 1810.44
it's already so bad

1808.399 --> 1813.3799999999999
that he's taking that

1810.44 --> 1816.3200000000002
'll be very careful with that like it's

1813.38 --> 1818.179
not like antihistamines is a symptom

1816.32 --> 1821.0
fighter

1818.179 --> 1825.26
it's not gonna fix the problem

1821.0 --> 1829.299
the doctor hasn't what the [ __ ]

1825.26 --> 1829.299
what the [ __ ] kind of doctor is that

1836.0 --> 1838.84
wow

1842.779 --> 1847.1
sounds more like a pillslinger to me

1845.059 --> 1850.46
then I mean that's

1847.1 --> 1854.98
dude that's logical advice oh you got

1850.46 --> 1854.98
severe skin problems with rashes and

1855.08 --> 1861.279
and do

1857.779 --> 1861.279
check your caffeine

1861.74 --> 1865.48
cut down on the coffees

1868.039 --> 1872.96
it's like that's a standard advice oh

1870.62 --> 1874.779
well I thought it was at least like what

1872.96 --> 1878.539
the hell

1874.779 --> 1881.6
that's the advice that I've been given a

1878.539 --> 1884.6
few times in the past

1881.6 --> 1885.74
not sure if it was by official dark no

1884.6 --> 1888.5
wait

1885.74 --> 1890.36
I'm not

1888.5 --> 1892.399
well it's the advice I've been given

1890.36 --> 1893.9599999999998
like through my dad at least he doesn't

1892.399 --> 1895.299
drink coffee anymore for a very long

1893.96 --> 1899.919
time

1895.299 --> 1899.9189999999999
and other people too I think

1901.039 --> 1905.6589999999999
anyway

1903.02 --> 1910.299
that's pretty messed up dude you gotta

1905.659 --> 1910.2990000000002
you gotta get control over the situation

1912.38 --> 1915.6200000000001
can't just keep shoving it in the

1914.179 --> 1918.0800000000002
background

1915.62 --> 1920.4799999999998
and using like

1918.08 --> 1924.1589999999999
you gotta change your ways all right

1920.48 --> 1924.159
it's only going to get worse

1929.0 --> 1931.779
right

1935.12 --> 1937.779
what

1940.58 --> 1947.34
okay

1942.38 --> 1947.3400000000001
[Music]

1948.02 --> 1950.679
foreign

1964.1 --> 1969.1399999999999
but yeah

1965.779 --> 1973.46
classical music but also coffee is like

1969.14 --> 1975.8600000000001
chemically known to cause histamine

1973.46 --> 1981.1000000000001
right what the antihistamines are

1975.86 --> 1981.1
supposedly for well it does exactly that

1981.919 --> 1985.94
it's known to do that that's really

1984.14 --> 1989.2990000000002
bizarre that somebody would give you

1985.94 --> 1991.7
that and not tell you like hey uh

1989.299 --> 1994.399
coffee actually might be the cause of

1991.7 --> 1997.659
that have you tried cutting down

1994.399 --> 1997.6589999999999
I mean that's

1999.919 --> 2004.3200000000002
what the hell man what kind of a doctor

2001.779 --> 2004.32
is that

2007.0 --> 2014.72
[Music]

2013.659 --> 2017.94
foreign

2014.72 --> 2017.94
[Music]

2023.1 --> 2029.5
so if you want any

2026.38 --> 2030.64
proper advice even though I'm not a

2029.5 --> 2033.399
doctor

2030.64 --> 2035.44
I'll give you whatever you need man I'll

2033.399 --> 2037.0
tell you whatever I know and I know a

2035.44 --> 2040.179
lot

2037.0 --> 2041.799
and you'll all get it for free

2040.179 --> 2044.5590000000002
because if you're in a crippled

2041.799 --> 2047.5
condition I'm not gonna get anything out

2044.559 --> 2049.06
of it now if you're thriving then I

2047.5 --> 2051.76
might get out something out of it I'll

2049.06 --> 2054.2799999999997
get a brother that is strong in arms out

2051.76 --> 2055.599
of it at least right so you know my

2054.28 --> 2058.96
motivations

2055.599 --> 2061.4190000000003
are at least pure versus doctors which

2058.96 --> 2065.02
might be entangled in all kinds of

2061.419 --> 2065.02
creepy contracts

2070.24 --> 2074.9399999999996
to reduce the release of History oh

2072.7 --> 2074.9399999999996
really

2084.28 --> 2088.7200000000003
hmm

2086.32 --> 2091.78
okay

2088.72 --> 2094.2599999999998
that's not a thank you Adam eiken I

2091.78 --> 2094.26
didn't know that

2098.38 --> 2103.78
how odd

2100.9 --> 2106.1800000000003
but if it is constantly technically

2103.78 --> 2109.0
doing that to the cells and all that

2106.18 --> 2111.2799999999997
right Adam then that means that if you

2109.0 --> 2113.859
like really overuse it for a very long

2111.28 --> 2117.099
time it's probably gonna have

2113.859 --> 2118.9
a a backlash influence on that level

2117.099 --> 2121.1800000000003
wouldn't it because that is what

2118.9 --> 2123.599
typically happens with with all forms of

2121.18 --> 2123.5989999999997
drugs

2124.359 --> 2129.52
you get this effect but if you then

2126.64 --> 2132.64
overuse it you you lose the effect and

2129.52 --> 2134.2599999999998
you only get the detriment

2132.64 --> 2137.52
so

2134.26 --> 2137.5200000000004
that makes sense right

2137.619 --> 2141.76
anyway look since I stopped drinking

2140.079 --> 2145.2000000000003
coffee personally

2141.76 --> 2145.2000000000003
the rushes went away

2148.839 --> 2156.16
so I have my personal empirical evidence

2153.28 --> 2158.52
for to back it up on that level at least

2156.16 --> 2158.52
right

2165.099 --> 2167.94
foreign

2174.9 --> 2180.76
statistical field research for yourself

2177.94 --> 2183.46
and just see out there okay

2180.76 --> 2185.92
all the people you bump into that drink

2183.46 --> 2188.38
a lot of coffee and they're like not

2185.92 --> 2190.96
super young anymore like that are in

2188.38 --> 2193.9
their 30s that drink a lot of coffee

2190.96 --> 2195.7
okay the 30s and above

2193.9 --> 2199.44
just look at them

2195.7 --> 2199.4399999999996
do they have pristine skin

2200.859 --> 2208.96
or do none of them have pristine skin

2205.119 --> 2209.4500000000003
versus those that do not like drink tons

2208.96 --> 2212.26
of coffee

2209.45 --> 2215.56
[Music]

2212.26 --> 2217.2400000000002
remember in the beginning dude when's

2215.56 --> 2219.16
the last time that I had serious skin

2217.24 --> 2221.74
issues

2219.16 --> 2224.5
remember like even in the flatter talks

2221.74 --> 2226.54
I had like horrible blister type skin

2224.5 --> 2228.88
issues at time

2226.54 --> 2230.98
that was when I was drinking coffee and

2228.88 --> 2233.859
I even had moments that when I drank the

2230.98 --> 2234.94
coffee that immediately it would start

2233.859 --> 2238.18
to hurt

2234.94 --> 2240.82
the second I had the coffee in

2238.18 --> 2245.5789999999997
so direct correlation that it was very

2240.82 --> 2245.579
stubborn to overlook for quite some time

2249.22 --> 2253.839
but I haven't had that since since I

2251.859 --> 2256.3199999999997
stopped drinking coffee

2253.839 --> 2256.32
right

2261.339 --> 2266.2
anyway thanks for the input

2263.57 --> 2269.26
[Music]

2266.2 --> 2271.5989999999997
personal experiences came yes yes yes

2269.26 --> 2275.32
but it is interesting to see if it is

2271.599 --> 2277.54
universal and not just my experience

2275.32 --> 2279.7000000000003
right but you got to start somewhere I

2277.54 --> 2281.8
mean it's ridiculous to say oh this

2279.7 --> 2283.72
applies to everybody if it doesn't even

2281.8 --> 2285.9
if you can't even prove it to apply to

2283.72 --> 2285.8999999999996
you

2289.48 --> 2293.579
a diuretic I do it yeah

2295.839 --> 2300.4
yeah you're welcome Michael Khan I mean

2298.42 --> 2302.44
just believe

2300.4 --> 2305.2200000000003
take the knowledge

2302.44 --> 2305.2200000000003
don't

2305.44 --> 2312.099
like you could actually get out of this

2307.66 --> 2314.2
okay I had like painful blister type

2312.099 --> 2318.42
skin issues

2314.2 --> 2318.4199999999996
in the [ __ ] face dude

2323.14 --> 2328.48
like yeah

2325.72 --> 2332.5
so I get it and that's like really

2328.48 --> 2335.38
[ __ ] up but you you I completely got

2332.5 --> 2337.48
out of it like nothing like that

2335.38 --> 2340.26
has returned

2337.48 --> 2340.26
for years

2342.71 --> 2345.78
[Music]

2349.06 --> 2352.68
so you can get out of it

2354.52 --> 2359.92
but start to cut down on the coffee and

2357.4 --> 2362.079
then if all possible stop taking the

2359.92 --> 2365.099
antihistamine if you're noticing that

2362.079 --> 2365.099
it's at least getting less

2365.26 --> 2370.2400000000002
and then

2367.06 --> 2372.64
well start recovery start start

2370.24 --> 2374.859
remembering what it is like to just have

2372.64 --> 2377.2
normal skin again

2374.859 --> 2378.7599999999998
and rebuild yourself up and make sure it

2377.2 --> 2383.02
doesn't happen again

2378.76 --> 2385.9
that you avoid those things that well

2383.02 --> 2387.339
with you have strong correlations that

2385.9 --> 2390.64
they cause it

2387.339 --> 2393.94
yeah strong indications that there is a

2390.64 --> 2396.24
causation there right so yeah good luck

watching movies too I actually watched

2788.68 --> 2792.8799999999997
two complete movies

2790.599 --> 2795.1600000000003
uh

2792.88 --> 2797.319
one of them I don't remember the name

2795.16 --> 2798.94

2800.98 --> 2805.9

watched list no it doesn't have that

2814.359 --> 2818.0789999999997
uh

2816.04 --> 2820.74
at least not that I've been able to

2818.079 --> 2820.7400000000002
figure out yet

2821.859 --> 2825.88
yeah Quantum of conscious had an

2823.66 --> 2827.859
interesting video this time I mean he's

2825.88 --> 2829.42
usually on about the same team though

2827.859 --> 2831.5789999999997
this ain't real and

2829.42 --> 2833.319
the not milk system

2831.579 --> 2835.48
but this time he had a really

2833.319 --> 2837.88
interesting

2835.48 --> 2840.46
analysis on it

2837.88 --> 2844.6600000000003
he's really trying to figure out like

2840.46 --> 2847.0
archetypes of well participants of not

2844.66 --> 2850.2999999999997
an elk system like he's really trying to

2847.0 --> 2853.48
figure out like how that works and this

2850.3 --> 2856.48
one was particularly interesting so

2853.48 --> 2858.579
Quantum of conscious

2856.48 --> 2861.359
always keeps you intellectually

2858.579 --> 2861.3590000000004
ventilated

2863.8 --> 2867.819
that's why oh yeah the movies

2865.9 --> 2871.26
yeah watch day

2867.819 --> 2871.2599999999998
I think pretty recent movie

2871.54 --> 2877.72
was seemingly very British but yeah it

2875.44 --> 2880.78
was uh the ritual

2877.72 --> 2882.8799999999997
and it was about well a bunch of British

2880.78 --> 2886.5400000000004
guys basically getting lost in the woods

2882.88 --> 2889.8
in Norway and ending up in some really

2886.54 --> 2889.8
freaky situation

2889.96 --> 2898.839
that movie was really really scary

2895.72 --> 2901.9199999999996
and the actors like were so good I mean

2898.839 --> 2901.92
this movie is

2902.02 --> 2906.52
like there's a lot of really shitty

2903.88 --> 2908.44
horror movies out there right with like

2906.52 --> 2910.359
annoying characters and then you just

2908.44 --> 2912.04
want them to you want to strangle them

2910.359 --> 2915.7
and then like when they get killed by

2912.04 --> 2918.339
the slasher you're like yay finally and

2915.7 --> 2920.5
yeah it's not good for you to watch it

2918.339 --> 2922.96
well this one like they're really

2920.5 --> 2924.16
awesome well developed well-rounded

2922.96 --> 2925.78
characters

2924.16 --> 2930.2999999999997
and it's

2925.78 --> 2930.3
it's all very scary and tragic

2931.359 --> 2940.44
right so if you want to see a scared ass

2935.44 --> 2940.44
good horror thriller movie

2940.599 --> 2945.04
with like

2942.76 --> 2947.3190000000004
with a fair amount of Gore but it's not

2945.04 --> 2950.98
like oh he's ripping it apart and you

2947.319 --> 2953.44
see it's not like Gore horror right it's

2950.98 --> 2956.98
it's much more scary

2953.44 --> 2959.64
and the music is like really [ __ ]

2956.98 --> 2962.56
ominous like freaking

2959.64 --> 2965.6189999999997
drums and [ __ ] drums from the deep

2962.56 --> 2968.68
Norway style it's like

2965.619 --> 2970.26
it's very tribal it's like a tribal

2968.68 --> 2974.2
Thriller

2970.26 --> 2975.7000000000003
really scary at times and ugh still

2974.2 --> 2977.4399999999996
thinking back to it like that thing

2975.7 --> 2979.0
scared the [ __ ] out of me like I

2977.44 --> 2982.42
literally had to watch another movie

2979.0 --> 2985.119
that was a scary movie but much older

2982.42 --> 2988.56
just to get that freaking movie off my

2985.119 --> 2988.56
mind before I went to sleep

2990.339 --> 2998.16
the ritual it's scary it's really scary

2995.98 --> 2998.16
foreign

3001.5 --> 3006.96
so yeah don't what that well yeah you

3004.5 --> 3008.28
probably will I I warned you enough I

3006.96 --> 3011.119
think I'm not gonna give any more

3008.28 --> 3011.119
spoilers to it

3014.819 --> 3019.14
but it was it was really well acted

3017.28 --> 3021.8390000000004
because like at the beginning it's just

3019.14 --> 3023.46
like yeah there's some personal drama in

3021.839 --> 3025.5
their lives

3023.46 --> 3027.54
it starts out with that and then they

3025.5 --> 3028.8
kind of like go on the trip to get over

3027.54 --> 3031.74
that

3028.8 --> 3034.98
right very standard setup and they're

3031.74 --> 3037.2
all just like uh casual and

3034.98 --> 3040.319
and then like as the movie progresses

3037.2 --> 3044.22
like that really shifts very logically

3040.319 --> 3047.7
they go on to every staircase of the way

3044.22 --> 3050.819
and like they all show like how they are

3047.7 --> 3054.24
and how they're changing through the

3050.819 --> 3056.22
the stress the the compounding stresses

3054.24 --> 3058.9799999999996
of what happens

3056.22 --> 3061.74
because it gets more and more and more

3058.98 --> 3065.3
and more [ __ ] up

3061.74 --> 3065.2999999999997
it's really scary

3067.44 --> 3075.38
and they all really seem very

3070.859 --> 3075.38
realistically there so it yeah

3076.619 --> 3081.38
it but yeah scary movie the ritual

3083.099 --> 3091.02
but well crafted scary movie actually

3086.7 --> 3093.4199999999996
scary and not just like horror like

3091.02 --> 3096.119
no

3093.42 --> 3098.099
stupid zombie slasher or something right

3096.119 --> 3100.619
that's not it

3098.099 --> 3102.3590000000004
it's it's [ __ ] scary anyway enough

3100.619 --> 3106.2000000000003
about that that wasn't the first one the

3102.359 --> 3108.48
other one ah let me figure out if I can

3106.2 --> 3112.7599999999998
remember the name it was with Charles

3108.48 --> 3112.76
Heston so it's an older movie

3112.8 --> 3117.78
about like

3115.38 --> 3121.2000000000003
egyptology

3117.78 --> 3123.9
like making some yeah it's like a curse

3121.2 --> 3126.6189999999997
of the Mummy type setup but it was very

3123.9 --> 3126.619
sophisticated

3126.96 --> 3131.339
it's probably a relatively famous movie

3129.359 --> 3134.72
but I don't remember the name so I'm

3131.339 --> 3134.72
gonna try to find it

3137.46 --> 3141.9
let's see

3139.319 --> 3145.05
I'm gonna try to find it back

3141.9 --> 3145.05
[Music]

3145.38 --> 3148.28
where is it where is it

3153.9 --> 3160.859
maybe if I just say recently

3156.9 --> 3164.42
watched does that work no it does not

3160.859 --> 3164.42
that's just [ __ ] great

3165.359 --> 3169.68
I didn't put it in the list

3167.52 --> 3171.3
it's like if you even want to remember

3169.68 --> 3173.04
what the hell you've been watching you

3171.3 --> 3176.42
have to put it in your list

3173.04 --> 3176.42
otherwise it's just gone

3190.619 --> 3193.1600000000003
all right

3193.8 --> 3201.3
I could also just search an IMDb

3198.059 --> 3205.0400000000004
for Charles Heston

3201.3 --> 3205.04
but man he's made so much

3222.96 --> 3229.319
sorry for uh for the hold up here I'm

3226.74 --> 3232.7
trying to find back the movie

3229.319 --> 3232.7
this is not easy

3250.64 --> 3256.7799999999997
okay right so I guess I'll just go in

3254.819 --> 3258.359
IMDb search it then

3256.78 --> 3261.78
[Music]

3258.359 --> 3263.2799999999997
I mean what the [ __ ] Netflix what the

3261.78 --> 3265.8590000000004
[ __ ]

3263.28 --> 3267.7200000000003
how can something be so incredibly hard

3265.859 --> 3270.119
to find back when you watched it that's

3267.72 --> 3272.8599999999997
just ridiculous

3270.119 --> 3275.949
uh

3272.86 --> 3275.949
[Music]

3282.98 --> 3286.34
[Music]

3288.18 --> 3292.16
is he called Charles Heston

3295.02 --> 3299.64
no

3296.64 --> 3303.74
wait did I even get the name wrong it's

3299.64 --> 3303.74
like that famous actor uh

3305.72 --> 3313.14
charting sorry yeah Charlton Heston

3309.599 --> 3316.579
yeah stupid

3313.14 --> 3316.5789999999997
uh thank you

3321.599 --> 3326.099
foreign

3323.339 --> 3328.7999999999997
that's right

3326.099 --> 3331.52
what an epic guy

3328.8 --> 3331.52
Epic

3331.98 --> 3335.54
uh let's see

3351.839 --> 3356.339
oh my God this is going to take a while

3354.359 --> 3359.72
scrolling through all this

3356.339 --> 3359.72
the guy made so many

3366.18 --> 3371.839
oh but it wasn't oh yeah I can scroll

3368.099 --> 3371.839
way back because it's much older movie

3372.54 --> 3375.5
uh

3380.52 --> 3384.2599999999998
sorry that green awesome

3387.72 --> 3390.859
is that it

3391.68 --> 3394.52
foreign

3398.339 --> 3402.5
that's hilarious yeah

3411.66 --> 3415.2799999999997
ah I think I found it

3419.0 --> 3425.059
yeah it the Awakening it's the Awakening

3425.3 --> 3429.619
1980 that's hilarious

3430.8 --> 3434.2200000000003
year of my birth

3432.66 --> 3436.5589999999997
yeah

3434.22 --> 3439.2
but seriously that was a very

3436.559 --> 3440.099
interesting movie for a relatively older

3439.2 --> 3443.839
movie

3440.099 --> 3443.839
I did I thought it was even older

3444.119 --> 3449.339
but it's not like it doesn't have like

3445.92 --> 3453.1800000000003
the goofy 80s style music it's like more

3449.339 --> 3454.92
with classical music very well made I

3453.18 --> 3456.44
like the music a lot

3454.92 --> 3460.26
all right

3456.44 --> 3463.14
and the acting was

3460.26 --> 3466.3190000000004
just interesting

3463.14 --> 3469.5
it's more like 70s style that way

3466.319 --> 3472.68
right so the Awakening I watched the

3469.5 --> 3473.56
ritual and The Awakening

3472.68 --> 3477.06
in that order

3473.56 --> 3477.06
[Music]

3487.08 --> 3501.15
[Music]

3500.04 --> 3506.52
what

3501.15 --> 3509.42
[Music]

3506.52 --> 3509.42
oh

3511.26 --> 3515.96
what's that the mystery of these things

3516.059 --> 3520.8190000000004
and

3518.64 --> 3520.819
thank you

3526.92 --> 3530.78
it's Sheldon has to do that

3531.69 --> 3536.7000000000003
[Music]

3533.7 --> 3539.1189999999997
okay that's not what I was talking about

3536.7 --> 3539.1189999999997
but

3551.04 --> 3554.46
right so that's the movies I've been

3552.9 --> 3557.819
watching yesterday

3554.46 --> 3560.16
very interesting and

3557.819 --> 3562.5
well the ritual was pretty freaking

3560.16 --> 3564.8999999999996
scary like

3562.5 --> 3567.319
like I did kind of like really feel

3564.9 --> 3571.7400000000002
uncomfortable I mean that's a movie you

3567.319 --> 3572.7
definitely should not allow children to

3571.74 --> 3576.72
watch

3572.7 --> 3578.52
like really don't it's not funny oh just

3576.72 --> 3581.359
watch it yourself and you'll figure that

3578.52 --> 3581.359
out yourself

3582.119 --> 3589.6800000000003
the other one yeah I mean with

3587.04 --> 3591.299
it's it's still kind of ominous and

3589.68 --> 3594.0589999999997
scary

3591.299 --> 3596.66
but it's more about like Egyptian lore

3594.059 --> 3596.6600000000003
and Magic

3599.28 --> 3604.26
it's less it's not a horror I mean

3602.22 --> 3607.2
there's a couple of terrible accidents

3604.26 --> 3610.579
that are like really well crafted I mean

3607.2 --> 3610.5789999999997
that looked pretty damn real

3613.079 --> 3618.7400000000002
but it's not like a horror movie like

3616.2 --> 3618.74
that at all

3621.77 --> 3627.54
[Music]

3624.9 --> 3631.6800000000003
now God Amanda Jung don't bring that up

3627.54 --> 3634.52
please please don't do that

3631.68 --> 3634.52
please don't

3635.04 --> 3639.48
dude

3637.02 --> 3643.619
I know all the worst of the worst movies

3639.48 --> 3645.72
thanks to a certain reviewer that I know

3643.619 --> 3647.52
and yeah that one is in the list but

3645.72 --> 3649.2599999999998
it's not the worst one out there though

3647.52 --> 3652.38
it's

3649.26 --> 3654.2400000000002
but nobody should know

3652.38 --> 3657.119
shouldn't care about what the worst

3654.24 --> 3658.4399999999996
movie is you just shouldn't watch crap

3657.119 --> 3660.6600000000003
like that

3658.44 --> 3662.4
because that movie is crap that you just

3660.66 --> 3665.1189999999997
brought up

3662.4 --> 3665.119
literally

3667.27 --> 3671.94
[Music]

3669.599 --> 3673.6800000000003
it's even secret yeah so who cares why

3671.94 --> 3675.08
did you even watch it

3673.68 --> 3682.2599999999998
it just sucks

3675.08 --> 3686.4
[Music]

3682.26 --> 3690.48
crap butt sick no it is sick and crap

3686.4 --> 3692.46
and it is crap because it is sick

3690.48 --> 3694.619
there's nothing redeemable about is

3692.46 --> 3699.92
nothing you can learn about it

3694.619 --> 3699.92
it's just [ __ ] gross and insane

3701.28 --> 3707.28
yeah the ritual

3703.859 --> 3709.799
is [ __ ] scary but there's absolutely

3707.28 --> 3712.92
things you can learn from watching it

3709.799 --> 3716.579
because everybody's behaving pretty damn

3712.92 --> 3719.78
natural it is really

3716.579 --> 3719.78
good like that

3720.42 --> 3726.059
right there's no stupid [ __ ]

3724.2 --> 3727.74
like everything that happened when

3726.059 --> 3729.78
somebody does something stupid it's

3727.74 --> 3731.7
because they are legitimately panicking

3729.78 --> 3733.98
and everybody would

3731.7 --> 3738.54
that sort of thing it's really natural

3733.98 --> 3741.559
in that sense right totally unlike what

3738.54 --> 3741.5589999999997
you just mentioned

3742.799 --> 3748.38
that category is more like torture porn

3744.96 --> 3748.38
so gross

3748.75 --> 3757.319
[Music]

3755.099 --> 3760.28
the South Park version yeah the human

3757.319 --> 3760.2799999999997
Sentai pad

3760.52 --> 3767.18
even though that even that version is

3763.44 --> 3767.18
still just gross and [ __ ] up

3769.13 --> 3772.1890000000003
[Music]

3773.4 --> 3780.359
so let's not lower

3776.16 --> 3781.68
the show to that level how about that

3780.359 --> 3785.2799999999997
huh

3781.68 --> 3788.69
let's not drag garbage

3785.28 --> 3791.7490000000003
indoor how about that

3788.69 --> 3791.7490000000003
[Music]

I mean you don't have your balls hanging

4410.6 --> 4416.179
under your butt right

4413.54 --> 4418.58

your legs I mean

4418.58 --> 4424.219
I disagree steamy trap

4421.34 --> 4425.96
but the idea I mean when you are

4424.219 --> 4428.54
splitting you are kind of vulnerable

4425.96 --> 4430.719
when you do that so in that sense I get

4428.54 --> 4430.719
it

4431.42 --> 4437.4400000000005
right while you do that yeah you can't

5362.679 --> 5368.7390000000005
myself out about Nathan

5365.26 --> 5370.12
well the situation I think got resolved

5368.739 --> 5373.54
I

5370.12 --> 5376.42
set what I needed to say

5373.54 --> 5378.219
and well Nathan kind of like immediately

5376.42 --> 5380.5
went on that

5378.219 --> 5383.139
pretty heavy debate

5380.5 --> 5385.3
that was amazing

5383.139 --> 5387.82
and yeah

5385.3 --> 5389.320000000001
but I mean it everything is still what

5387.82 --> 5393.46
it is

5389.32 --> 5397.54
I'm not gonna do Bowl win unless

5393.46 --> 5400.36
yeah unless I'm not going to be rumpus

5397.54 --> 5403.06
like that's not gonna change

5400.36 --> 5405.58
but yeah Nathan has shown that

5403.06 --> 5409.06
he can definitely

5405.58 --> 5410.139
do that that he can withhold himself

5409.06 --> 5413.04
right

5410.139 --> 5413.04
even on camera

5416.88 --> 5423.42

5668.86 --> 5673.78
I mean it's good to spread information

5670.78 --> 5676.639999999999

you're not polarizing oh really so

5696.46 --> 5700.84
telling people you shouldn't include

5699.1 --> 5702.88
that number

5700.84 --> 5704.9800000000005
because of something terrible that

5702.88 --> 5707.9800000000005

5729.88 --> 5734.56
way in or something you seem

5731.199 --> 5738.339999999999
legitimately wanting to do this

5734.56 --> 5739.719
but hey you are selling yourself

5738.34 --> 5742.54
doing that

5739.719 --> 5744.719
just like I'm selling myself doing all

5742.54 --> 5744.719

5795.4 --> 5801.159
yeah there's nothing wrong with selling

5798.04 --> 5803.56

5801.159 --> 5806.138999999999
things or ideas

5803.56 --> 5808.3
yeah selling an idea

5806.139 --> 5810.88
do you know that expression selling an

5808.3 --> 5814.3
idea yeah

5810.88 --> 5818.6990000000005
that's not about money exchange for the

5814.3 --> 5818.6990000000005
idea that's about convincing people

5821.86 --> 5824.46

better

5863.62 --> 5870.219
as it has been over time

5866.38 --> 5873.52
right A lot of my older ideas are also

5870.219 --> 5876.34
well I've sold them yeah I put them down

5873.52 --> 5880.06
put it down like years and years ago

5876.34 --> 5883.0
five years ago seven years ago put it

5880.06 --> 5883.719
down on camera in titles spread it

5883.0 --> 5886.0
around

5883.719 --> 5889.06
and it's now coming to fruition people

5886.0 --> 5892.26
are finally recognizing it

5889.06 --> 5892.26
that I was right

5896.44 --> 5904.96
because I sold them in I I put down the

5901.42 --> 5908.26
idea I made it convincing compelling

5904.96 --> 5910.84
even though very Niche not something you

5908.26 --> 5912.219
easily graphed into your daily habits or

5910.84 --> 5914.5
whatever

5912.219 --> 5916.7390000000005
and just kept doing that and it's

5914.5 --> 5916.739
working

5924.34 --> 5928.56
okay rest that yeah

5928.78 --> 5931.199
cute

5931.719 --> 5936.34
maybe maybe at some point I will

5934.3 --> 5938.56
see

5936.34 --> 5940.6
I'm still yeah I'm still kind of

5938.56 --> 5942.9400000000005
exploring myself what it's like not

5940.6 --> 5945.88
drinking anymore so we'll see what

5942.94 --> 5948.219
happens maybe I will

5945.88 --> 5952.26
of them absolutely not guaranteeing

5948.219 --> 5952.26
anything I'm not making any promises so

5954.1 --> 5958.1990000000005
and concerns the p900

5970.74 --> 5973.88
[Music]

5982.659 --> 5988.259999999999

[Music]

5997.36 --> 6004.28
it's not about being right oh really

6000.3 --> 6004.28
it's not about being right okay

6010.28 --> 6015.84
let me lead the truth

6013.139 --> 6018.86
it makes no sense if you speak the truth

6015.84 --> 6018.860000000001
then you're right

6019.86 --> 6024.48
if you're not right

6022.199 --> 6025.98
about what you're talking about then how

6024.48 --> 6029.12
can you say that you're speaking the

6025.98 --> 6029.12
truth that makes no sense

6040.139 --> 6044.84
why would it be on your hands in the

6042.36 --> 6044.839999999999
first place

6045.48 --> 6049.5
but just because you know now you're

6047.639 --> 6052.400000000001
certainly responsible for all of them

6049.5 --> 6052.4
are you serious

6052.98 --> 6056.659
that's not how that works at all

6060.179 --> 6065.82
I mean you will carry responsibility

6062.52 --> 6067.56
with your interactions with them sure

6065.82 --> 6070.34
but you

6067.56 --> 6070.34
just ridiculous

6072.48 --> 6077.48
yeah but you're not responsible for any

6075.06 --> 6077.4800000000005
of them

6077.94 --> 6083.48
you're only responsible for yourself and

6080.699 --> 6083.48
your interaction

6083.52 --> 6086.540000000001
with those people

6088.44 --> 6093.419999999999
yeah they're not giving it to you you

6090.9 --> 6096.36
can't just

6093.42 --> 6098.219
claim responsibility yeah it's like oh

6096.36 --> 6099.96
yeah I have responsibility for you yeah

6098.219 --> 6101.76
I'll just tell you get the [ __ ] out here

6099.96 --> 6106.58

6132.08 --> 6136.38
besides there's technically nothing

6134.1 --> 6138.54
wrong in believing in the globe

6136.38 --> 6139.5
there's nothing wrong with that it's

6138.54 --> 6142.56
only

6139.5 --> 6145.32
when you're faced with the truth

6142.56 --> 6147.6
that you start lying

6145.32 --> 6150.36
about it right when you lie and

6147.6 --> 6155.34
manipulate that is where the sin comes

6150.36 --> 6157.199
in just believing in it is not evil it's

6155.34 --> 6159.659000000001
just a mistake

6157.199 --> 6164.54
sometimes a very tenacious mistake that

6159.659 --> 6164.54
can seduce you into becoming demonic

6165.9 --> 6169.699
that's not a guarantee though

6184.619 --> 6188.759999999999
you are heaviness that way on your heart

6186.3 --> 6190.860000000001
yeah well that's your heaviness that's

6188.76 --> 6194.96
that's yours

6190.86 --> 6194.96
it's not their happiness that's you

6196.38 --> 6200.639
yeah just because you suddenly feel all

6199.26 --> 6202.8
that weight through your realization

6200.639 --> 6204.78
doesn't mean that the world has changed

6202.8 --> 6207.8
it just means that you're looking at it

6204.78 --> 6207.8
from a different angle

6215.06 --> 6221.9400000000005
right upon realization of anything you

6219.119 --> 6223.5599999999995
should always realize it was always like

6221.94 --> 6226.739
that

6223.56 --> 6228.42
you just didn't see it that's how it

6226.739 --> 6231.0
really works

6228.42 --> 6232.679
things don't change the world doesn't

6231.0 --> 6236.84
change just because you realize

6232.679 --> 6236.84
something no it's you that changed

[Music]

6261.3 --> 6266.1
foreign

6263.34 --> 6270.42
I mean if you with your messages want to

6266.1 --> 6272.6990000000005
like help a flat earthers to feel more

6270.42 --> 6274.8
comfortable about being a flat earther

6272.699 --> 6277.32
and like less

6274.8 --> 6279.6
worried about oh globers are looking

6277.32 --> 6282.36
down on them and [ __ ] all over them

6279.6 --> 6285.119000000001
yeah then I get it right

6282.36 --> 6290.0
I mean it's nice to feel like yeah we're

6285.119 --> 6290.0
on the winning side and like I get it

6292.619 --> 6297.299999999999
what I like to do rather is just kind of

6295.92 --> 6300.2390000000005
mend

6297.3 --> 6301.92
the issues that are in both parties

6300.239 --> 6306.178999999999
towards one another

6301.92 --> 6308.34
to get an understanding from both sides

6306.179 --> 6310.32
like the Ballers realized like yeah we

6308.34 --> 6312.84
kind of need the flat earthers they

6310.32 --> 6315.48
understand things that we cannot see

6312.84 --> 6317.76
but that do work out and we don't like

6315.48 --> 6320.759999999999
that we'll never like

6317.76 --> 6322.860000000001
want to give them credit for it but we

6320.76 --> 6326.6990000000005
know we got to keep them around and not

6322.86 --> 6328.86
just try to kill them off or something

6326.699 --> 6331.44
right

6328.86 --> 6333.54
well for the flat earthers well the same

6331.44 --> 6336.96
should be there I mean the globe

6333.54 --> 6339.06
religion is there for a reason is the

6336.96 --> 6341.4
widely integrated we're gonna have to

6339.06 --> 6344.9400000000005
deal with it for a long time to come

6341.4 --> 6349.5599999999995
so wouldn't it be better to find

6344.94 --> 6352.44
Common Ground like I have tried here

6349.56 --> 6354.659000000001
figure out that there is more to life

6352.44 --> 6357.36
than just the philosophical difference

6354.659 --> 6359.96
of the nature of the ground we're

6357.36 --> 6359.96
standing on

6365.0 --> 6369.96
there's actually

6367.56 --> 6371.46
worse things happening out there right

6369.96 --> 6373.56
now

6371.46 --> 6376.159

you just keep doing what you're doing

6405.96 --> 6411.06
but do realize that you are polarizing

6408.84 --> 6414.8
and that that is actually counter

6411.06 --> 6414.8
opposite to what I'm trying to achieve

6422.699 --> 6426.78
so I don't particularly resonate with

6425.58 --> 6428.82
what you're doing

6426.78 --> 6432.84
even though I do recognize you're doing

6428.82 --> 6435.54
it from a good place in your heart

6432.84 --> 6438.0
which feels very young

6435.54 --> 6441.36
it's a very young type of spirit

6438.0 --> 6444.719
with some naivety in it try to relay

6441.36 --> 6447.38
that but you're just hot in in it so you

6444.719 --> 6447.38
just keep going

6447.9 --> 6454.199
but be wary

6450.54 --> 6455.82
don't yeah don't don't start a war this

6454.199 --> 6458.78
is right don't start some like

6455.82 --> 6462.0
philosophical Civil War or something

6458.78 --> 6465.8
doing it the nobody needs that that's

6462.0 --> 6465.8
that's only gonna make it worse

6465.9 --> 6472.5599999999995
right

6468.42 --> 6476.88
it's only gonna give the globe religious

6472.56 --> 6479.46
people it really like a a good reason

6476.88 --> 6480.78
to basically get along with each other

6479.46 --> 6484.5
better

6480.78 --> 6486.84
with the common threats opposing them

6484.5 --> 6490.02
more than just flat Earth there's not

6486.84 --> 6492.96
having the right opinion right so don't

6490.02 --> 6496.76
give them what they need

6492.96 --> 6500.6
to retain their power

6496.76 --> 6500.6
let them crumble

6501.3 --> 6505.76
the power runs

6503.28 --> 6505.759999999999
anyway

6533.34 --> 6535.52
thank you

6541.739 --> 6546.678999999999
well yeah clearly that's blatantly

6544.32 --> 6546.679
obvious

6547.02 --> 6553.92
but that's part of what I'm that's part

6549.719 --> 6556.199
of my directive it's like just don't

6553.92 --> 6558.4800000000005
make peace between the philosophies and

6556.199 --> 6560.46
realize that there's more

6558.48 --> 6563.099999999999
there's more

6560.46 --> 6565.139
is more pressing issues out there right

6563.1 --> 6566.76
now even though this is a continuing

6565.139 --> 6568.9800000000005
issue it's not going to go away Flat

6566.76 --> 6573.5
Earth versus globe

6568.98 --> 6573.5
right but we're not gonna win it

6593.219 --> 6599.04
lies are not power oh really they're not

6597.06 --> 6601.219
well it seems to be working out just

6599.04 --> 6601.219
fine

6606.239 --> 6612.239
and lies our power

6609.42 --> 6615.179
but truth carries something different

6612.239 --> 6618.379999999999
than just power it carries strength

6615.179 --> 6620.9400000000005
carries cohesion it carries fractal

6618.38 --> 6622.8
long-term viability

6620.94 --> 6625.86
and that is something that lies do not

6622.8 --> 6628.7390000000005
hold but lies definitely our power

6625.86 --> 6631.739
they're just short-term power and they

6628.739 --> 6634.5199999999995
have a like a

6631.739 --> 6634.5199999999995
price

6635.04 --> 6641.34
the growing of Darkness bad yeah more

6638.639 --> 6643.619
obstacles for you to overcome

6641.34 --> 6645.3
and if you don't then you slide deeper

6643.619 --> 6647.28
into darkness

6645.3 --> 6649.4400000000005
but there is definitely power there on

6647.28 --> 6652.199
the short run that's like the the thing

6649.44 --> 6654.178999999999
about lying is that it does have

6652.199 --> 6655.98
short-term power that is why it is

6654.179 --> 6658.679
seductive and that is why people become

6655.98 --> 6660.239
Liars because of the power of it it's

6658.679 --> 6661.9800000000005
ridiculous to say it doesn't have power

6660.239 --> 6666.32
it does

6661.98 --> 6666.32
it just doesn't give you strength

6687.96 --> 6694.38
yeah don't talk about that

6691.38 --> 6696.54
no don't mention that here I don't want

6694.38 --> 6697.7390000000005
it

6696.54 --> 6701.76
right

6697.739 --> 6704.5199999999995
I can reference medical experimentation

6701.76 --> 6707.219
and that's it I don't want any other

6704.52 --> 6710.46
word associate or

6707.219 --> 6713.84
messed up cryptic sized word I don't

6710.46 --> 6713.84
want it don't mention it

6717.78 --> 6720.739
let me translate indeed

6722.46 --> 6725.52
all right anyway it's been an

6723.659 --> 6728.48
interesting back and forth though even

6725.52 --> 6728.4800000000005
though we're kind of like

6728.88 --> 6734.1
like not getting together it's

6731.52 --> 6737.719
interesting hearing you say that and

6734.1 --> 6737.719
because then I can respond to it

6737.88 --> 6743.6990000000005
