61.54 --> 67.39
Super chats PayPal patreon and my

63.58 --> 77.74
GoFundMe much appreciated if you do so

67.39 --> 81.43
today the weather is poof hot comparing

77.74 --> 84.91
to earlier as this morning it was very

81.43 --> 87.67
hot not so cloudy though but they did

84.91 --> 90.16
Kemp drilled the [ __ ] out of the places

87.67 --> 94.06
I'm really surprised to even see a piece

90.16 --> 96.34
of blue right there but yeah they kept

94.06 --> 100.63
trailed big-time it was all blue in the

96.34 --> 106.15
morning and yeah I guess there's clouds

100.63 --> 108.82
now so maybe that's what they sprayed I

106.15 --> 113.56
guess I don't know or it all blew away

108.82 --> 116.82
because it is quite windy winds blown

113.56 --> 116.82000000000001
pretty pretty hard

120.6 --> 127.229
but yeah lovely sunny day and people are

123.96 --> 129.17
all out in their t-shirt strolling

127.229 --> 132.24
around slowly

129.17 --> 135.92999999999998
enjoying the heat or rather enjoying the

132.24 --> 138.23000000000002
shadow and being like oh hot but lovely

135.93 --> 138.23000000000002
day

141.53 --> 153.65
so let's see who is in chat yeah earlier

149.24 --> 156.29000000000002
stone monkey 3d got in then Mateus the

153.65 --> 159.89000000000001
walking witness they lie oh hi o

156.29 --> 165.56
righteous force lady I am Steve Ben

159.89 --> 171.82
Adams a McKenzie Amanda young

165.56 --> 175.4
hmm drunken bullet for one one Steve

171.82 --> 177.29
Hannah bear and I was good to see

175.4 --> 181.489
another bear here Fyodor Dostoevsky

177.29 --> 182.35999999999999
hello Jason Cormac I killed the hope on

181.489 --> 185.78
a one rockhound

182.36 --> 193.34
wow so many people is good to see you

185.78 --> 194.06
all yeah today with me I got some stuff

193.34 --> 203.51
I got

194.06 --> 205.82
Tamara coffee I got tea have imported in

203.51 --> 209.89999999999998
it in retrospect it's kind of way too

205.82 --> 212.66
hot for tea that still got water though

209.9 --> 216.61
take a sip of that anyway I do also have

212.66 --> 221.69
an apple not overkill sighs this one a

216.61 --> 225.41000000000003
banana and a remnant of Illuminati

221.69 --> 227.18
croissant didn't finish it out that was

225.41 --> 230.63
part of my early lunch

227.18 --> 233.9
so I got up incredibly early today it

230.63 --> 237.079
was really almost unsettling but it was

233.9 --> 240.41
weird like I got up at a half past seven

237.079 --> 244.459
and I just looked at a clock and it was

240.41 --> 248.329
like no I no way no no can't be right

244.459 --> 251.51
because I never get up that early but I

248.329 --> 253.82
was just ready to go so maybe that's

251.51 --> 257.18
still the Alpha power that I took

253.82 --> 262.43
yesterday I think kind of is because I

257.18 --> 264.71
feel like really good all day a few

262.43 --> 268.03000000000003
really strong had great conversations

264.71 --> 268.03
with a lot of confidence and

268.43 --> 276.169
and done some interesting things for

271.58 --> 278.65
example let's see now roughly an hour

276.169 --> 278.65
ago

279.55 --> 285.68
maybe more my roommate downstairs who's

283.13 --> 287.71999999999997
moving out she had an accident like

285.68 --> 291.47
something fell over actually was trying

287.72 --> 292.78900000000004
to move it almost crashed into a window

291.47 --> 295.25
with her head but that didn't happen

292.789 --> 299.65999999999997
fortunately but she did with her shoes

295.25 --> 303.02
step into like a a wire frame thing you

299.66 --> 304.07000000000005
suspend to put like things on hang them

303.02 --> 309.26
um

304.07 --> 312.26
so on Iren iron sorry and I ruined great

309.26 --> 314.75
and had hooks in it and she stepped with

312.26 --> 317.389
almost on her heel right into it went

314.75 --> 319.55
right through her shoe into a hearse in

317.389 --> 321.62
yeah right before her he'll not inner

319.55 --> 326.05
heel she's really looking for that

321.62 --> 329.21
because then she'd be in big trouble and

326.05 --> 330.979
yeah she totally panicked yeah and when

329.21 --> 333.71
I rushed downstairs because she was

330.979 --> 335.93
literally screaming in fear and agony I

333.71 --> 339.04999999999995
was like oh [ __ ] I hope she's not like

335.93 --> 340.849
really seriously wounded but mostly

339.05 --> 343.31
panicking didn't know what to do and

340.849 --> 346.19
call an ambulance I was there and like

343.31 --> 347.27
uh let me I can pull it out probably it

346.19 --> 349.669
doesn't look too bad

347.27 --> 352.31
and I checked it out compared it with my

349.669 --> 355.49
own foot just to see like where is that

352.31 --> 359.599
and it I in retrospect it seemed like it

355.49 --> 361.729
was not in the heel but it went like

359.599 --> 365.99
right before it into the soft tissue

361.729 --> 370.58
wait yeah right before it so she was

365.99 --> 372.86
kind of lucky and then I used a wrench

370.58 --> 374.9
basically to get in between the hook and

372.86 --> 377.27000000000004
then quickly pulled it out and didn't

374.9 --> 379.88
even hurt that much in retrospect was

377.27 --> 382.52
just a lot of panic and I helped her out

379.88 --> 385.61
and it was really nice to do that I

382.52 --> 386.78
liked that and I felt very confident I

385.61 --> 388.82
just like yeah I know

386.78 --> 391.19
she's panicking I just have to calm her

388.82 --> 393.949
down and it's not that bad and I'm very

391.19 --> 396.289
confident of my analysis of that and I

393.949 --> 398.81
tested it like how much does this hurt

396.289 --> 400.97999999999996
can you basically gave her example like

398.81 --> 404.87
okay do you feel it and it's like

400.98 --> 407.22
or is it like really subtly excruciating

404.87 --> 409.32
like your yeah

407.22 --> 413.91
like you're being poked here or

409.32 --> 416.7
something and well she understood and

413.91 --> 419.04
communication was great I even smoked a

416.7 --> 421.2
joint with her right before hit before

419.04 --> 422.64000000000004
this with her downstairs because yes she

421.2 --> 424.53
was moving she's not moving now

422.64 --> 426.21
basically the rest of her family and

424.53 --> 430.2
friends were taking over and she's just

426.21 --> 435.59999999999997
sitting there bandage on her foot but

430.2 --> 439.77
yeah it's nice it was nice to do and I

435.6 --> 441.83000000000004
feel good I feel like I can do that

439.77 --> 441.83
again

443.24 --> 452.37
our weenie and pay no meter well I just

447.84 --> 455.21999999999997
I know how to explain the different type

452.37 --> 457.05
of pain sensations and I pretty much

455.22 --> 461.25
know from experience where they come

457.05 --> 463.83
from and I kind of know how to try yeah

461.25 --> 465.6
how to help people that don't really

463.83 --> 468.83
aren't used to explaining themselves

465.6 --> 471.6
like that give them something that is

468.83 --> 474.57
easily understandable for them so they

471.6 --> 475.86
they they get the picture I'm kind of

474.57 --> 479.49
good at that it's what I've been

475.86 --> 481.8
practicing for years now so anyway it

479.49 --> 487.31
was good hello by the way a Rasta hat

481.8 --> 487.31
and ranty good to see you both

501.389 --> 512.07
our winni an apple time you indeed it's

508.439 --> 530.04
even read like your Apple little more

him sweet and just a little bit fresh

537.63 --> 542.99
sorry

538.31 --> 542.9899999999999
hey hello Sleeping warrior good morning

543.709 --> 549.7199999999999
so hey do you guys know what's going on

547.74 --> 553.529
now with the debates how it's supposed

549.72 --> 555.57
to be working now is it still is Nathan

553.529 --> 558.24
still posting the Hangout link in the

555.57 --> 562.649
master V chats before the show starts or

558.24 --> 565.13
is that over now I have no idea do you

562.649 --> 565.13
guys know

580.55 --> 589.4499999999999
twenties July that's a revelation that

585.29 --> 589.4499999999999
expected on 20 July what

594.57 --> 599.49
you have to unlike me what I apparently

597.209 --> 601.079
meant with that I don't remember that

599.49 --> 603.589
specific what do you mean

601.079 --> 603.5889999999999
white bear

610.37 --> 613.12
thank you

620.72 --> 624.4100000000001
hmm okay hello righteous force by the

624.05 --> 632.53
way

624.41 --> 635.8399999999999
Oh the moon landing anniversary yeah

632.53 --> 639.05
well I gave options with that I get I

635.84 --> 644.6
always keep it safe I said like they

639.05 --> 647.9
could use it for something to reinforce

644.6 --> 650.36
it or it's just same old same old

647.9 --> 652.1899999999999
like nothing special or they or they

650.36 --> 655.1800000000001
could have Declassified it or something

652.19 --> 657.7700000000001
and gave it up today uh apparently

655.18 --> 662.54
nothing really special happened I don't

657.77 --> 665.06
know yet I maybe you could help in for

662.54 --> 668.48
me I've been kind of busy reading up on

665.06 --> 671.8699999999999
quantum mechanics and it's interesting

668.48 --> 676.6700000000001
because I already found flaws a bit in

671.87 --> 685.33
the intro of it it's all over the telly

676.67 --> 688.76
in the US okay so it's just a general

685.33 --> 691.1600000000001
special like oh the moon landings what

688.76 --> 694.31
they did for America the same old story

691.16 --> 696.8299999999999
is is that what it is or is it more

694.31 --> 699.6199999999999
focused on oh this is what the US is

696.83 --> 704.0
going to do now in the near future what

699.62 --> 708.4
is it like I don't have United States

704.0 --> 708.4
television available to me

714.59 --> 718.1800000000001
hello the enemy Caen

726.14 --> 732.1999999999999
I knew double down on the moon yep hey

729.8 --> 734.54
Thank You Amanda young for a $5 ship

732.2 --> 736.4590000000001
chatter nation if you're not going to

734.54 --> 740.38
Nathan I'm not going so I don't know

736.459 --> 740.38
what's going on huh

744.74 --> 755.3
what you know come on you the debates is

752.6 --> 759.2900000000001
still the debates without me right it's

755.3 --> 766.43
not like I'm that important I know I do

759.29 --> 768.11
contribute something but I don't we'll

766.43 --> 769.91
see what happens I don't know if I'm

768.11 --> 772.61
gonna join the debates if I can we'll

769.91 --> 775.31
see I'll probably try it out it's just

772.61 --> 776.87
that I might end up just doing the same

775.31 --> 779.1199999999999
thing again just maybe say something

776.87 --> 780.83
somewhere and then at some point I'm

779.12 --> 786.14
just kind of getting sick of it and then

780.83 --> 789.89
leave that that's it that's basically

786.14 --> 794.4399999999999
all I probably have to offer if things

789.89 --> 794.4399999999999
keep on going as they have so

799.79 --> 805.279
come on I'm not really boycotting the

803.069 --> 805.279
show

833.81 --> 836.91
yeah I don't know what to say every it's

836.28 --> 839.0699999999999
just that

836.91 --> 843.27
look I'm not really boycotting the show

839.07 --> 845.07
and yeah I don't want to talk bad about

843.27 --> 848.13
the show you know I just have my

845.07 --> 851.49
personal complaints and analysis and all

848.13 --> 854.82
that and I don't know I just feel like I

851.49 --> 857.61
need a break at that specifically and I

854.82 --> 860.4000000000001
want to spend my time in a more

857.61 --> 864.75
productive way so yeah I have literally

860.4 --> 873.27
engaged in oh thanks thanks rest ahead

864.75 --> 878.46
smoke one with me with you yeah okay

873.27 --> 880.65
we you have to visit me to do that but

878.46 --> 883.98
thanks for the superjet the nation I

880.65 --> 887.4
might throw one somewhere at some point

883.98 --> 889.59
just because I feel like it anyway oh my

887.4 --> 895.55
god this door needs to stay open it's a

889.59 --> 895.5500000000001
lot fish

897.51 --> 904.62
yeah I'm gonna take off my shoes and he

902.22 --> 911.73
was them to keep the door open it's way

904.62 --> 913.41
too hot for shoes anyway this gets any

911.73 --> 924.9200000000001
worse I'll have to take off my shirt or

913.41 --> 928.8299999999999
something but what was I talking about

924.92 --> 931.41
yeah the debates I feel like I need a

928.83 --> 933.69
little break and I am literally engaging

931.41 --> 937.62
now in a new project and it's gonna take

933.69 --> 940.3800000000001
some concentration so I already feel

937.62 --> 944.25
like oh [ __ ] I remember this I had this

940.38 --> 946.08
in front of my face before and then I

944.25 --> 946.65
couldn't handle it it was too much

946.08 --> 950.22
pressure

946.65 --> 952.1999999999999
so I disengaged it's very quickly but I

950.22 --> 954.09
am gonna read it now and it's so funny

952.2 --> 956.4000000000001
because I got so much more to reflect

954.09 --> 959.25
upon and I've already found in the

956.4 --> 964.68
introduction page pretty serious flaws

959.25 --> 969.81
in arguments basically they the guy

964.68 --> 974.3399999999999
claimed that it's a given that mass in

969.81 --> 976.14
matter increases when extreme velocities

974.34 --> 978.51
are reached mainly the suppose at

976.14 --> 980.6999999999999
Lightspeed and that's just a claim out

978.51 --> 981.74
of nothing there's absolutely nothing to

980.7 --> 985.26
support that

981.74 --> 987.03
nothing matter proven to be matter has

985.26 --> 990.0
probably ever been accelerated to that

987.03 --> 991.65
kind of speed I don't believe that maybe

990.0 --> 997.92
that suggests that with the cyclotron

991.65 --> 1001.36
and you know that but it just it seems

997.92 --> 1001.36
very unfounded and

1010.74 --> 1016.87
yeah I will be but first I have to get

1013.81 --> 1018.7299999999999
through it and I'm just gonna be a bit

1016.87 --> 1021.399
of a complaining pants maybe at first

1018.73 --> 1024.28
because I see flaws and then later get

1021.399 --> 1026.799
why why that it was a Miss assumption

1024.28 --> 1030.3999999999999
maybe that'll happen I'm just giving you

1026.799 --> 1032.439
preliminary readings things like it

1030.4 --> 1042.189
seemed like there were Stein Steinem

1032.439 --> 1046.48
assumptions in there so trying to

1042.189 --> 1049.3600000000001
basically put light within a spectrum

1046.48 --> 1052.24
with matter like it is connected and I

1049.36 --> 1055.8999999999999
don't think it is but it seems like he

1052.24 --> 1059.14
was trying to give you that that

1055.9 --> 1062.5
suggestion through the intro and I

1059.14 --> 1065.3500000000001
definitely noticed that and yeah it's

1062.5 --> 1067.03
very suspicious about that but yeah I've

1065.35 --> 1069.1899999999998
got through the first page it was

1067.03 --> 1078.22
basically a revisiting of general

1069.19 --> 1081.0700000000002
chemistry and general things and yeah it

1078.22 --> 1086.309
was pretty interesting but that's what I

1081.07 --> 1086.309
did this morning I'll keep you updated

1092.49 --> 1097.74
is it all vibrations well yes they

1095.16 --> 1101.0400000000002
explained that it was really interesting

1097.74 --> 1103.56
because the way he depicted the

1101.04 --> 1105.99
fine-tuned workings of chemistry and

1103.56 --> 1108.12
like the different levels of approach of

1105.99 --> 1111.77
what we generally get to observe and

1108.12 --> 1114.9899999999998
what actually is pretty much going on

1111.77 --> 1117.96
about how matter literally how pressure

1114.99 --> 1121.8
works that molecules are basically

1117.96 --> 1125.04
bumping into one another and that causes

1121.8 --> 1127.08
certain effects that are not that

1125.04 --> 1131.67
apparent was very interesting at one

1127.08 --> 1135.51
point he explained how water dissolves

1131.67 --> 1138.99
gradually how that works and then yeah

1135.51 --> 1141.6299999999999
that water vapor basically mixes in with

1138.99 --> 1144.5
the air and how that were how it settled

1141.63 --> 1147.0600000000002
how there is an exchange rate between

1144.5 --> 1150.6
evaporation and rhe condensation it was

1147.06 --> 1153.03
just a very good oversight in how that

1150.6 --> 1156.3899999999999
it was it was very enlightening to read

1153.03 --> 1158.34
that so I am definitely captivated by

1156.39 --> 1161.4
this writer and the way the depth that

1158.34 --> 1165.0
he has in his description it's good very

1161.4 --> 1168.0600000000002
very interesting but it's it's still

1165.0 --> 1169.56
just the first page it's a big page but

1168.06 --> 1173.94
it's still just the first page and now

1169.56 --> 1175.79
like into the second one and we'll see

1173.94 --> 1178.26
where it goes

1175.79 --> 1180.6299999999999
but I'm definitely going to engage in

1178.26 --> 1183.08
try to read through as much of it as I

1180.63 --> 1186.0300000000002
can by the way thank you Colin Turner

1183.08 --> 1190.29
for the 5-pound super chat donation much

1186.03 --> 1194.0
appreciated Wow getting super chats all

1190.29 --> 1194.0
over the place thanks guys

1201.41 --> 1211.53
but yeah I really feel the bigger issue

1206.91 --> 1213.5700000000002
more and more it's it's I'm starting to

1211.53 --> 1216.6
differentiate between the bodies of

1213.57 --> 1219.36
science and the original spirit of the

1216.6 --> 1224.28
foundations that of on which it all

1219.36 --> 1230.4299999999998
rests and that is I feel the task and

1224.28 --> 1232.95
the method that I will have and it's

1230.43 --> 1238.55
basically one of the important aspect of

1232.95 --> 1241.95
it is to recognize and route Einsteinian

1238.55 --> 1246.1499999999999
assumptions because Einstein is where a

1241.95 --> 1248.25
lot went wrong where we're really

1246.15 --> 1251.3700000000001
science got derailed more than ever

1248.25 --> 1255.09
before and put into the realm of

1251.37 --> 1259.1399999999999
fictional pseudoscience and vast amounts

1255.09 --> 1261.1799999999998
of assumption based reasoning that is

1259.14 --> 1264.63
where that started and you can recognize

1261.18 --> 1266.97
it I recognize it now just by being

1264.63 --> 1270.3300000000002
confronted with the data and I recognise

1266.97 --> 1272.64
it in where it's talked about where

1270.33 --> 1274.83
these assumptions are routed and then I

1272.64 --> 1277.1100000000001
start to figure out when I recognize it

1274.83 --> 1282.27
what are the consequences of this

1277.11 --> 1284.76
misconception does it leave nowhere is

1282.27 --> 1288.2
there a seeming connection that is not

1284.76 --> 1291.06
actually true that is how I literally

1288.2 --> 1293.73
rearranged the entire thing in my mind

1291.06 --> 1296.1299999999999
to see how valid it is when you

1293.73 --> 1298.6100000000001
literally erase certain key words that's

1296.13 --> 1301.5
basically the what the process is like

1298.61 --> 1303.4499999999998
erase certain concepts that are definite

1301.5 --> 1306.65
that I'm gonna assume are not true

1303.45 --> 1309.54
because I have reasons to do that and

1306.65 --> 1311.3600000000001
that's what I'm gonna be doing and I'm

1309.54 --> 1314.06
really really looking forward to it it's

1311.36 --> 1317.04
maybe that is why I feel such a kick

1314.06 --> 1320.99
because when I decided to take this on

1317.04 --> 1323.67
it was like finally a real serious task

1320.99 --> 1326.85
something that's gonna require my full

1323.67 --> 1328.63
mind to get it it's actually gonna be a

1326.85 --> 1330.1299999999999
challenge of some sorts

1328.63 --> 1332.5
and I'm really happy about it my

1330.13 --> 1335.2900000000002
subconscious seems very accelerated and

1332.5 --> 1338.62
is rewarding me with a great boost of

1335.29 --> 1342.22
confidence so yeah that's what I'm gonna

1338.62 --> 1345.25
be doing going through these studies and

1342.22 --> 1347.1100000000001
maybe it'll go pretty quick since I seem

1345.25 --> 1349.42
to be very enthusiastic and then I'll

1347.11 --> 1352.0
pick up another type of book from

1349.42 --> 1354.5500000000002
another writer maybe I'll get through

1352.0 --> 1357.52
more of it and I'll just be reporting

1354.55 --> 1359.62
openly about my study progress in

1357.52 --> 1361.15
quantum mechanics and try to relay some

1359.62 --> 1363.6
of the things that I've learned and seen

1361.15 --> 1367.5400000000002
so I hope you find that interesting

1363.6 --> 1369.34
maybe I'll be able to help you to get a

1367.54 --> 1371.2
little bit more grip on quantum

1369.34 --> 1373.84
mechanics because that is in general it

1371.2 --> 1377.3500000000001
seems to be at least a big problem for a

1373.84 --> 1379.6299999999999
lot of people that it's just it seems a

1377.35 --> 1382.54
little too hard and you just can't get a

1379.63 --> 1384.0700000000002
grip on it and that's the problem with a

1382.54 --> 1386.4099999999999
lot of people it's a problem I used to

1384.07 --> 1391.9299999999998
have but I'm finally in a stage where

1386.41 --> 1396.3400000000001
I'm ready to now really dig into it so I

1391.93 --> 1402.16
hope to help you guys as I dig into this

1396.34 --> 1405.1599999999999
project with that atomism indeed and by

1402.16 --> 1407.3500000000001
the way that is also addressed the clear

1405.16 --> 1409.96
it was interesting because he brought in

1407.35 --> 1412.6299999999999
different branches of philosophical

1409.96 --> 1414.8500000000001
approach and atomism was one of them

1412.63 --> 1420.21
didn't widely address it when he brought

1414.85 --> 1425.28
it up at least not yet but it was good

1420.21 --> 1428.56
just very wide thinking and I like that

1425.28 --> 1430.27
can I help write to hands I don't think

1428.56 --> 1431.47
anyone can help write that and I think

1430.27 --> 1439.47
the only one that can help write the

1431.47 --> 1439.47
hand is right to hand you know

1447.1 --> 1455.2099999999998
yep that's right : Turner as a baller

1450.2 --> 1460.19
repellant QE is definitely functional

1455.21 --> 1463.58
and willing he has the the anima the

1460.19 --> 1466.19
animal to keep going at him he's a very

1463.58 --> 1468.23
aggressive guard dog he just doesn't

1466.19 --> 1471.05
deal well with friendlies

1468.23 --> 1475.3700000000001
that's his issue so if you want a guard

1471.05 --> 1488.6299999999999
dog yeah that's what is good for if you

1475.37 --> 1491.3
want a think tank not so much right well

1488.63 --> 1495.25
Ben Adams nathan is goat you say

1491.3 --> 1500.47
covering up he is he is exciting with

1495.25 --> 1503.09
with John because I think that Nathan

1500.47 --> 1507.71
definitely doesn't get quantum mechanics

1503.09 --> 1510.77
and yeah that that threshold that I just

1507.71 --> 1512.9
spoke about that people just it's just a

1510.77 --> 1514.97
little bit too difficult and people just

1512.9 --> 1517.0400000000002
bounce off it they don't they don't let

1514.97 --> 1520.01
it in they don't want to engage and I

1517.04 --> 1523.49
think Nathan has that he's given off the

1520.01 --> 1525.86
signs like when I tried to discuss

1523.49 --> 1527.9
quantum mechanical things the doubts I I

1525.86 --> 1530.4499999999998
said it on the show several times and it

1527.9 --> 1534.89
didn't stick like he couldn't hear it

1530.45 --> 1536.69
so I think he has this as well it just

1534.89 --> 1538.3100000000002
it deflects off him he just doesn't get

1536.69 --> 1540.91
it and he's siding with somebody that he

1538.31 --> 1545.45
trusts understands it well enough I

1540.91 --> 1549.95
think that's why he's doing that but

1545.45 --> 1554.42
that's what I think I guess I could ask

1549.95 --> 1556.6100000000001
him maybe or you guys could ask him in

1554.42 --> 1559.16
chat if he's gonna respond there's

1556.61 --> 1563.35
another thing or maybe you could get

1559.16 --> 1565.25
chocolates saying to ask I don't know

1563.35 --> 1567.32
although it's gonna be pretty difficult

1565.25 --> 1571.07
for anyone to basically make a statement

1567.32 --> 1573.56
like that if they themselves don't have

1571.07 --> 1575.09
confidence that they have any kind of

1573.56 --> 1577.61
understanding about quantum mechanics

1575.09 --> 1579.98
then it's very hard to bring that forth

1577.61 --> 1585.9189999999999
so maybe it is pointed to me

1579.98 --> 1588.08
to do that we'll see I don't feel any

1585.919 --> 1590.9
obligations to hurry it up you know

1588.08 --> 1594.32
Nathan is Nathan it's his show it's his

1590.9 --> 1597.0800000000002
life if there's something he really

1594.32 --> 1600.8899999999999
needs from me he can always ask he's

1597.08 --> 1603.9499999999998
helped me quite a lot in the past pretty

1600.89 --> 1607.13
much in yeah encouraged me to get on

1603.95 --> 1609.22
YouTube I'll never forget that I'll

1607.13 --> 1614.2700000000002
always be thankful for that know

1609.22 --> 1616.88
whatever happens like even where you say

1614.27 --> 1621.98
you were to go like really dark for some

1616.88 --> 1624.8600000000001
reason that'll hurt but I'd never forget

1621.98 --> 1627.38
that he literally helped me so that

1624.86 --> 1630.53
remains so but let's not assume anything

1627.38 --> 1632.21
dark will happen like that I don't think

1630.53 --> 1644.809
yeah I don't see anything like that

1632.21 --> 1646.04
looming on the horizon but yeah oh yeah

1644.809 --> 1648.44
by the way I did

1646.04 --> 1652.61
oh I kept stuck to YouTube yesterday

1648.44 --> 1654.02
because I'm Rob Skiba at a live stream

1652.61 --> 1656.84
pretty long one

1654.02 --> 1659.69
and I was pretty active in chat it was

1656.84 --> 1663.1
good had some really good discussions

1659.69 --> 1667.179
showed some very interesting

1663.1 --> 1670.549
presentations about ufologists and

1667.179 --> 1673.6000000000001
ancient aliens and yeah the guy with the

1670.549 --> 1676.309
goofy hair from that show was even in it

1673.6 --> 1679.6399999999999
and it was really fascinating because

1676.309 --> 1683.78
yeah look as I say you know I pick up

1679.64 --> 1686.419
things like I sense spiritual things

1683.78 --> 1688.6299999999999
going on and while Rob Skiba already

1686.419 --> 1692.419
explained like yeah these people also

1688.63 --> 1694.669
probably use ayahuasca get into the

1692.419 --> 1696.5590000000002
other dimension pretty much the dark

1694.669 --> 1698.45
world was described in detail it's

1696.559 --> 1701.96
pretty freaky when you get to the hair

1698.45 --> 1704.48
that so yeah that's definitely very

1701.96 --> 1708.02
similar it's like it was really hooked I

1704.48 --> 1712.58
couldn't stop watching but I picked up

1708.02 --> 1713.27
certain things when I listened to a

1712.58 --> 1715.07
couple

1713.27 --> 1718.43
the individuals that were very good

1715.07 --> 1720.23
people so not all of them were all evil

1718.43 --> 1724.64
like that they weren't all like

1720.23 --> 1726.65
knowingly bald illusion spreaders some

1724.64 --> 1730.13
of them were pretty naughty okay and and

1726.65 --> 1732.73
dwelling and and had Luciferian ideas

1730.13 --> 1734.93
definitely but there were some real

1732.73 --> 1737.24
humanists that were just generally

1734.93 --> 1739.46
curious about spirituality and how it

1737.24 --> 1741.98
works and that's resonates heavily with

1739.46 --> 1744.3700000000001
me so I picked a couple of very

1741.98 --> 1748.67
interesting things when they talked

1744.37 --> 1751.07
actually had spiritual messages like

1748.67 --> 1752.78
yeah it's not like I hear a voice but

1751.07 --> 1756.77
it's like somebody's telling me

1752.78 --> 1764.11
something like I remember it it's very

1756.77 --> 1770.42
fascinating and that also gave me a huge

1764.11 --> 1773.6299999999999
drive out of nothing I was suddenly like

1770.42 --> 1776.1200000000001
yeah I'm gonna get a job right now

1773.63 --> 1777.44
and like I'm gonna freakin enjoy it even

1776.12 --> 1779.4499999999998
though I'm supposed to hate it I'm gonna

1777.44 --> 1783.0800000000002
enjoy it and I'm gonna get really good

1779.45 --> 1787.19
at it and like I was in a mania rush

1783.08 --> 1789.3799999999999
almost because of it because at one

1787.19 --> 1791.45
point they explained something about the

1789.38 --> 1794.2700000000002
experience and what the entities do how

1791.45 --> 1796.55
they interact and that was so close that

1794.27 --> 1801.02
was so incredibly close to what I

1796.55 --> 1802.99
experienced in that huge thing I could

1801.02 --> 1807.26
even understand more details about it

1802.99 --> 1809.75
that they didn't elaborate on because it

1807.26 --> 1813.2
can get pretty complex but that other

1809.75 --> 1816.38
world that parallel spiritual dimension

1813.2 --> 1822.14
that you can share with others and what

1816.38 --> 1825.2600000000002
the entities do how that works and for

1822.14 --> 1829.19
the first time maybe yeah for the first

1825.26 --> 1832.34
time for real something switched in me

1829.19 --> 1836.24
it's pretty significant this is not like

1832.34 --> 1837.59
a general realization no it's people

1836.24 --> 1840.08
have been telling me this for a long

1837.59 --> 1842.81
time because my memories of my dark

1840.08 --> 1845.4199999999998
world experiences sometimes really haunt

1842.81 --> 1847.1299999999999
me because they feel like they were

1845.42 --> 1849.8600000000001
absolutely real

1847.13 --> 1851.8100000000002
and they make me very paranoid sometimes

1849.86 --> 1854.35
especially when I said they don't feel

1851.81 --> 1857.0
very confident or well it happens and

1854.35 --> 1860.2099999999998
yeah like my dad it was pretty much the

1857.0 --> 1862.43
first one that I started talking about

1860.21 --> 1868.01
these experiences and that's that's

1862.43 --> 1870.95
almost 20 years ago or no yeah yeah yeah

1868.01 --> 1872.47
when I was 19 I think I told him I kind

1870.95 --> 1874.88
of secretly didn't tell anyone else

1872.47 --> 1876.65
because I was really scared and they

1874.88 --> 1880.5500000000002
were hunting me telling me not to share

1876.65 --> 1882.5300000000002
it with anyone it's that weird but he

1880.55 --> 1887.6599999999999
was the first to tell me like yeah it's

1882.53 --> 1891.17
not real and a genuine reflection to the

1887.66 --> 1894.2
energy that I was outputting but even

1891.17 --> 1896.54
though I got that I couldn't break loose

1894.2 --> 1899.42
from the concept that there was just two

1896.54 --> 1902.3899999999999
worlds and that one side would always

1899.42 --> 1904.3400000000001
oppose the other and and vice versa so I

1902.39 --> 1906.44
couldn't really distinct it was so

1904.34 --> 1908.6299999999999
impressive to me that I couldn't really

1906.44 --> 1911.5700000000002
make up my mind about it

1908.63 --> 1914.2700000000002
so I just like okay as long as I

1911.57 --> 1916.25
experience linear reality I have to act

1914.27 --> 1919.19
according to how people in linear

1916.25 --> 1922.46
reality accepted yet that much in fact

1919.19 --> 1926.0
okay basically it's a miracle I didn't

1922.46 --> 1931.13
go completely insane but it had a lot of

1926.0 --> 1934.07
impact now it chemically meditate no it

1931.13 --> 1935.69
was I was given ayahuasca and I had no

1934.07 --> 1938.4099999999999
idea what I was getting into and the

1935.69 --> 1941.93
people were not particularly

1938.41 --> 1945.19
well-meaning with me they were like

1941.93 --> 1949.64
testing me and I kind of allowed it

1945.19 --> 1952.22
because I thought I was a god

1949.64 --> 1954.3200000000002
I was very arrogant I was megalomaniacal

1952.22 --> 1957.08
I thought I felt so strong I thought I

1954.32 --> 1961.8799999999999
could do anything I thought I would be

1957.08 --> 1963.6499999999999
the one that kind of [ __ ] and yeah then

1961.88 --> 1966.279
I experienced the whole thing and I

1963.65 --> 1972.279
definitely figured out like yeah

1966.279 --> 1978.549
No so and yeah came out of it a broken

1972.279 --> 1983.83
guy and was very confused for a long

1978.549 --> 1986.2
time also pretty much broke up the

1983.83 --> 1988.529
entire period where normally people of

1986.2 --> 1991.559
my of that age would go and get jobs I

1988.529 --> 1994.659
isolated myself I was like completely

1991.559 --> 1999.729
derailed from that experience for a long

1994.659 --> 2002.429
time so that's yeah I've talked about

1999.729 --> 2005.219
the general experience itself a lot a

2002.429 --> 2009.3890000000001
lot but this yeah it had made a huge

2005.219 --> 2011.8490000000002
impact on my life and not all that great

2009.389 --> 2014.57
although I guess in retrospect after all

2011.849 --> 2017.849
this time it has been a pretty

2014.57 --> 2019.95
magnificent lesson because I'm very

2017.849 --> 2022.619
sharp with these things where most

2019.95 --> 2026.999
people just don't even know how to look

2022.619 --> 2035.269
there but it I paid a very big price for

2026.999 --> 2035.269
it a big chunk of my life so

2035.84 --> 2041.75
but it was fascinating because it can

2039.56 --> 2043.6699999999998
get back to what I was talking about my

2041.75 --> 2048.59
dad was the first to tell me like yeah

2043.67 --> 2050.51
that's not real that's like a lie and I

2048.59 --> 2052.4300000000003
couldn't couldn't accept

2050.51 --> 2053.8100000000004
it's very almost like the balls thing

2052.43 --> 2057.5899999999997
you know they're spinning ball it's like

2053.81 --> 2061.0099999999998
yeah they can no you know it was similar

2057.59 --> 2063.5
like no that's not real that's like a

2061.01 --> 2067.01
lying illusion but it's so convincing I

2063.5 --> 2069.26
couldn't accept it and now a lot of

2067.01 --> 2071.6600000000003
times past I've already realized and

2069.26 --> 2074.36
figured out technically that some things

2071.66 --> 2076.37
were definitely provably just by that by

2074.36 --> 2079.28
the consequence of things that happened

2076.37 --> 2082.25
were lies so that was a reinsurance for

2079.28 --> 2084.4700000000003
myself like yeah they really are despite

2082.25 --> 2087.71
them being so convincing and now I

2084.47 --> 2090.1099999999997
listened they talked about it um through

2087.71 --> 2092.36
other people's experience that these

2090.11 --> 2096.1400000000003
persons some of these people have

2092.36 --> 2098.54
studied dozens of people going through

2096.14 --> 2101.69
these things and I could see it I could

2098.54 --> 2103.73
literally see it as in their eyes as

2101.69 --> 2107.27
they talked about I could see how white

2103.73 --> 2110.27
and cross-reference their insight was it

2107.27 --> 2112.97
was pretty incredible and when she said

2110.27 --> 2115.85
those things with her full conclusion it

2112.97 --> 2121.0299999999997
really finally set in she said like

2115.85 --> 2125.14
those things are lies this is out and

2121.03 --> 2128.6200000000003
for the first time that I heard this I

2125.14 --> 2130.97
truly felt that it was true it

2128.62 --> 2134.0
completely went through me and I was

2130.97 --> 2137.33
almost unleashed like the nightmare has

2134.0 --> 2143.03
by finally been dispelled for real this

2137.33 --> 2143.89
time I don't I'm not afraid of it

2143.03 --> 2147.4300000000003
anymore

2143.89 --> 2147.43
any of it

2149.29 --> 2156.73
but I will be vigilant forever but I

2153.37 --> 2159.25
will never let it I will the fear that

2156.73 --> 2161.98
came with it will never be unleashed

2159.25 --> 2165.64
upon me again but I will sometimes have

2161.98 --> 2167.5
doubts and references and I will be

2165.64 --> 2172.74
vigilant because of it but it will never

2167.5 --> 2176.92
be going into that fear assumption again

2172.74 --> 2178.6
and that happened when I walked Krupski

2176.92 --> 2181.21
by yesterday when he showed

2178.6 --> 2184.66
presentations by these these people

2181.21 --> 2186.58
these kind of alien cultists some of

2184.66 --> 2189.31
them some of them were pretty freaky

2186.58 --> 2192.0699999999997
they were and how it was explained to

2189.31 --> 2194.83
like you go to entities and you can

2192.07 --> 2197.7400000000002
basically bind with them exchange things

2194.83 --> 2201.43
but that's binding and I think that's

2197.74 --> 2204.25
very bad I think that's that is what

2201.43 --> 2207.43
actually like you know it might work for

2204.25 --> 2210.73
a for a time but then when frequencies

2207.43 --> 2213.3399999999997
change spirits can shift and then when

2210.73 --> 2216.43
you're still tied into is something that

2213.34 --> 2218.86
something may change and I think that is

2216.43 --> 2220.87
the overall risk that all these people

2218.86 --> 2222.67
are taking without realizing it that it

2220.87 --> 2225.52
could suddenly turn around and that's

2222.67 --> 2229.96
maybe kind of similar to what sort of

2225.52 --> 2232.38
happens to the upper echelons of the

2229.96 --> 2234.7
Democratic Party although they probably

2232.38 --> 2240.31
underwent that kind of a spiritual

2234.7 --> 2242.89
sudden switch pretty early on but it all

2240.31 --> 2245.89
depends on how the wide swath of people

2242.89 --> 2248.7999999999997
how far they will go in trusting what

2245.89 --> 2251.1099999999997
the spirits tell them to do and if they

2248.8 --> 2253.4500000000003
will trust blindly or if they will

2251.11 --> 2255.61
actually understand the path the

2253.45 --> 2258.85
frequency and recognize when you should

2255.61 --> 2262.78
not follow because that's going to be

2258.85 --> 2266.11
critical for their survival it's a very

2262.78 --> 2267.88
fascinating thing to think about that

2266.11 --> 2270.82
there is a swath of people out there

2267.88 --> 2274.6
growing that is doing that that is

2270.82 --> 2278.53
undergoing this this spiritual discovery

2274.6 --> 2281.98
and connection open Armand Lee it is

2278.53 --> 2283.48
almost like the hippie revival to the

2281.98 --> 2286.46
spiritual realm

2283.48 --> 2290.05
but that's very dangerous because we

2286.46 --> 2292.46
know what happens with that type of move

2290.05 --> 2295.4900000000002
what happens after that

2292.46 --> 2297.7400000000002
so the dangers are already kind of

2295.49 --> 2300.4399999999996
apparent to me as I explained right

2297.74 --> 2303.1699999999996
before this it's fascinating that whole

2300.44 --> 2305.9
speech if you haven't seen Rob's Kiba if

2303.17 --> 2309.5
you if anybody doesn't know Rob's Kiba

2305.9 --> 2311.06
check him out just go for Rob's Kiba you

2309.5 --> 2313.25
know what I'll link him up I got it I

2311.06 --> 2315.74
got the right channel I'm subscribed to

2313.25 --> 2318.38
him is it good he's he's the FIR is one

2315.74 --> 2321.4399999999996
of the first wave he's been around since

2318.38 --> 2323.69
the beginning he had a lot of doubts

2321.44 --> 2327.26
about Flat Earth at first he was a globe

2323.69 --> 2330.86
er then he jumped back I and I think

2327.26 --> 2332.51
that he's kind of like not really

2330.86 --> 2337.2400000000002
dealing with it anymore I'm mostly

2332.51 --> 2341.03
focusing on the deceptions and and

2337.24 --> 2343.1
atheism versus Christianity that kind of

2341.03 --> 2345.98
thing and not focusing on Flat Earth

2343.1 --> 2348.11
itself so much although he did speak

2345.98 --> 2354.26
about it's somewhat let's see well let

2348.11 --> 2357.52
me find the channel why didn't it

2354.26 --> 2357.5200000000004
register I upload it

2358.66 --> 2360.69
ah

2369.94 --> 2374.819
and I got so many people I'm subscribed

2372.7 --> 2374.819
to

2390.57 --> 2393.6200000000003
yeah there is

2396.94 --> 2408.77
yeah exposing the evolution ancient oh

2401.859 --> 2413.08
my god okay it's in total a seven and a

2408.77 --> 2416.02
half hour hangout it's quite a big one I

2413.08 --> 2420.19
don't think I saw all of it

2416.02 --> 2423.32
so yeah here this is the video I watched

2420.19 --> 2428.48
you might find me in the chat replay at

2423.32 --> 2430.7000000000003
some point it's yeah the part of the

2428.48 --> 2433.55
pieces that I saw were in incredibly

2430.7 --> 2435.64
interesting very elaborate presentations

2433.55 --> 2438.4700000000003
from these ufologists and everything

2435.64 --> 2441.92
worth a watch if you can find the time

2438.47 --> 2443.6899999999996
and subscribe to his channel is yeah he

2441.92 --> 2446.17
it's been around forever he's a good

2443.69 --> 2446.17
Christian

2447.13 --> 2452.63
so yeah that's Rob's Kiba and I've yeah

2450.47 --> 2455.7999999999997
it's I was very lucky to catch him life

2452.63 --> 2455.8
he doesn't go live a lot

2467.46 --> 2476.64
well power bottom Jesus I don't look he

2473.64 --> 2478.859
can be graduate of whatever he likes I'm

2476.64 --> 2482.8799999999997
gonna judge people by their message in

2478.859 --> 2485.88
their work and overall he's not a

2482.88 --> 2488.79
flawless person he has some issues but I

2485.88 --> 2491.25
think he's done great and he's always it

2488.79 --> 2494.73
does definitely work on himself I can

2491.25 --> 2496.77
see it he does work on himself he's

2494.73 --> 2499.43
really trying to do his best so I think

2496.77 --> 2499.43
he's a good guy

2516.8 --> 2520.88
yeah oh by the way there was also a

2519.08 --> 2524.45
parts of Star Trek The Next Generation

2520.88 --> 2526.4
he showed where they had quantum

2524.45 --> 2528.5
technobabble ideas in there it was

2526.4 --> 2531.7400000000002
really cool to see that with the fresh

2528.5 --> 2533.81
eyes you know look at that hangout

2531.74 --> 2536.0899999999997
a lot of it a lot of interesting

2533.81 --> 2537.62
separate video so I think probably the

2536.09 --> 2540.17
entire thing is pretty much worth

2537.62 --> 2554.5699999999997
watching it was really good

2540.17 --> 2572.6
I'm just surprising what's how long 40

2554.57 --> 2575.7400000000002
minutes pseudoscience is a minor branch

2572.6 --> 2578.74
of the magical arts that's that's lovely

2575.74 --> 2584.3599999999997
well pseudoscience is basically Mesmer

2578.74 --> 2588.2299999999996
it is mind trickery to suggest solid

2584.36 --> 2591.53
sound logic where in actuality there is

2588.23 --> 2595.31
machinations so it is wizardry it is

2591.53 --> 2599.5400000000004
magic but it's a very specific type it's

2595.31 --> 2602.99
Mesmer mesmerize ation ordering the

2599.54 --> 2605.54
words in a way that mistakes are gonna

2602.99 --> 2607.25
be made automatically it's counting on

2605.54 --> 2609.5
it the structure the machination is

2607.25 --> 2611.93
counting on people to overlook certain

2609.5 --> 2614.36
things and to automatically assume

2611.93 --> 2618.02
things because it knows the nature of

2614.36 --> 2620.6
people it was designed with the nature

2618.02 --> 2624.19
of people in mind that's why it's a

2620.6 --> 2626.7799999999997
mecha nation so every time for example

2624.19 --> 2630.4700000000003
Owen Benjamin says wizards and their

2626.78 --> 2632.1400000000003
wizards is I'm always like ah I wish it

2630.47 --> 2635.06
should know better

2632.14 --> 2637.2799999999997
it's not wizardry it's Mesmer it's this

2635.06 --> 2639.65
very specific school of magic very

2637.28 --> 2643.8500000000004
specific falls under the illusion class

2639.65 --> 2646.28
and it is to confuse so it's not

2643.85 --> 2649.58
wizardry all of it there's a lot of

2646.28 --> 2650.5600000000004
wizardry yielding knowledge could also

2649.58 --> 2656.98
technically

2650.56 --> 2661.12
seen as wizardry and plant knowledge all

2656.98 --> 2664.38
that so but anyway I call it Mesmer but

2661.12 --> 2667.08
I will use the word wizardry sometimes

2664.38 --> 2670.21
because it's a lot quicker and more

2667.08 --> 2679.36
up-to-date with the modern lingo that's

2670.21 --> 2683.73
the own Benjamin no it's it's not Harry

2679.36 --> 2687.9700000000003
Potter style magic saucy London it's

2683.73 --> 2692.23
it's actually science it's magic with

2687.97 --> 2694.87
words it's trickery with words not using

2692.23 --> 2699.64
the actual original purpose of the words

2694.87 --> 2703.87
but using the mentality of people that

2699.64 --> 2708.2799999999997
deal with the words and reverse-engineer

2703.87 --> 2711.67
mechanics in order to auto real people

2708.28 --> 2715.77
into a certain belief structure provide

2711.67 --> 2719.83
that real road for them and that is

2715.77 --> 2723.06
wizardry it is it's trickery

2719.83 --> 2723.06
it's Mesmer

2733.5 --> 2742.6
it's bypassing reality with illusion and

2740.1 --> 2749.2
making people believe the illusion is

2742.6 --> 2752.17
reality or a part of reality so that

2749.2 --> 2755.56
people will from thereon assume that

2752.17 --> 2758.19
part to be part of reality and then they

2755.56 --> 2758.19
are mesmerised

2781.85 --> 2790.67
okey right guys seems to be going at

2787.8 --> 2790.67
each other s cat

2816.88 --> 2831.099
yeah yeah 63 watching thanks everyone

2822.22 --> 2833.41
I hope I I am here to amuse but yeah if

2831.099 --> 2835.539
anyone has any questions because I'm now

2833.41 --> 2837.549
trying to catch up on in chat but you

2835.539 --> 2840.2690000000002
people seem to be debating some things

2837.549 --> 2840.269
among yourselves

2840.989 --> 2846.67
where is Jaime Brown I have no idea I

2844.15 --> 2850.539
haven't seen that guy in a long time but

2846.67 --> 2859.9
I'm presuming his life hang outing

2850.539 --> 2863.4100000000003
somewhere I don't know didn't he turn

2859.9 --> 2869.2000000000003
into a baller again I think I remember

2863.41 --> 2872.769
he let himself be pulled to the baller

2869.2 --> 2874.479
side again that was a while ago a few

2872.769 --> 2876.93
months I think or half a year something

2874.479 --> 2876.93
like that

2886.13 --> 2893.119
mm-hmm this is a very chill the channel

2889.91 --> 2895.1299999999997
is it called a Turner well it is a

2893.119 --> 2899.809
breakfast show it's supposed to be just

2895.13 --> 2902.059
calm and I said no no anxiety and hustle

2899.809 --> 2912.13
all that so you could just wake up and

2902.059 --> 2916.989
get your mind going so no Jason I am NOT

2912.13 --> 2916.989
down don't go back on that road

2917.44 --> 2921.94
you know what happens when you do that

2939.81 --> 2948.91
by the way strangely enough and I

2947.17 --> 2951.2200000000003
probably shouldn't bring this up but I

2948.91 --> 2963.52
can't help it's the freaking

2951.22 --> 2967.72
intellectual honesty i weirdly weirdly

2963.52 --> 2970.62
enough in the intro text I found a

2967.72 --> 2976.1499999999996
couple of very interesting statements

2970.62 --> 2980.95
that actually gives well a slight hint

2976.15 --> 2985.1800000000003
of credence to what Spurs kemo is trying

2980.95 --> 2989.0699999999997
to do but only a slight hint it's like I

2985.18 --> 2993.91
was kind of surprised by what was said

2989.07 --> 2997.3
but it's no in no way a a fruitful

2993.91 --> 3000.48
foundation can be considered like that

2997.3 --> 3001.92
but it we're kind of hints like almost

3000.48 --> 3004.37
seems like there's something to it

3001.92 --> 3007.23
because pressure increase decrease

3004.37 --> 3015.2
apparently does directly correlate with

3007.23 --> 3015.2
temperature they say but

3016.0 --> 3022.17
how do you approach that I just wonder

3018.91 --> 3025.859
if you could probably test it with a

3022.17 --> 3027.79
chamber with gas pressure in it a

3025.859 --> 3031.63
temperature changer and a pressure

3027.79 --> 3036.7599999999998
increase and just see how linear the

3031.63 --> 3039.07
effect is like if you're stiff you fire

3036.76 --> 3040.9
up the heater and it heats up the air

3039.07 --> 3049.9
well the PIA the pressure will probably

3040.9 --> 3053.2000000000003
increase but will it increase as much as

3049.9 --> 3055.359
the temperature increases compared to

3053.2 --> 3059.02
when you don't heat up the heater but

3055.359 --> 3063.16
literally increase the pressure thus the

3059.02 --> 3065.17
overall air heat up just as much as the

3063.16 --> 3068.02
correlating outcoming pressure and I

3065.17 --> 3070.48
don't think so I think that he'd

3068.02 --> 3078.73
probably creates pressure as a side

3070.48 --> 3083.349
effect much less then no weight add the

3078.73 --> 3085.839
other way around that pressure as a side

3083.349 --> 3089.2200000000003
effect of heat is probably a lot less

3085.839 --> 3094.24
than heat as a side effect of pressure

3089.22 --> 3098.859
or I don't know for some reason I am not

3094.24 --> 3101.109
getting this straight out yeah I just

3098.859 --> 3103.5699999999997
think that there's an asymmetrical

3101.109 --> 3105.97
relation it's not directly linear which

3103.57 --> 3108.5800000000004
would be required to completely attempt

3105.97 --> 3113.0699999999997
to nullify one of the sides and I don't

3108.58 --> 3113.0699999999997
think that correlation is that linear I

3113.79 --> 3119.65
think the other side always comes after

3117.089 --> 3122.7599999999998
it's always going to be a side now it's

3119.65 --> 3127.06
less than the first factor you influence

3122.76 --> 3129.3390000000004
so if you increase the heat then the

3127.06 --> 3131.23
pressure will increase but not at much

3129.339 --> 3133.63
as the heat will be increased and if you

3131.23 --> 3135.97
increase the pressure then heat may

3133.63 --> 3138.3
increase but not as much as the pressure

3135.97 --> 3143.0499999999997
increases yes that's the way to say it

3138.3 --> 3146.23
that's it that's my point and that kind

3143.05 --> 3148.63
of really breaks at the very foundations

3146.23 --> 3151.06
of parts for schemas attempt

3148.63 --> 3154.7200000000003
nullifies gas pressure because the

3151.06 --> 3157.93
correlation is not linear the one is

3154.72 --> 3160.39
always a side effect of the other there

3157.93 --> 3162.79
are correlation but sucide effect

3160.39 --> 3165.7599999999998
relation not a direct linear relation in

3162.79 --> 3168.43
every case so yeah that was interesting

3165.76 --> 3173.44
that I got that also from reading

3168.43 --> 3177.1
through that intro oh god push full oh

3173.44 --> 3181.03
no right now I remember I actually

3177.1 --> 3185.11
visited Dell for a second it was kind of

3181.03 --> 3187.98
funny and I asked him how many grams of

3185.11 --> 3190.63
cannabis do you smoke each day

3187.98 --> 3192.85
overlooking that apparently he doesn't

3190.63 --> 3197.17
smoke that and he's always just smoking

3192.85 --> 3199.27
cigarettes so he says but he got all

3197.17 --> 3201.82
pissy and tied me out because he then

3199.27 --> 3205.36
started to talk for five minutes oh I am

3201.82 --> 3206.17
trying to frame him by suggesting he's a

3205.36 --> 3211.0
drug user

3206.17 --> 3213.79
like right oh that's what you get when

3211.0 --> 3217.0
you ask tell a question and spritz Kimo

3213.79 --> 3218.56
got on there too right and they started

3217.0 --> 3222.87
to go with the gas pressure thing I

3218.56 --> 3222.87
think it was totally silly

3226.97 --> 3231.3799999999997
oh I just didn't go to slander I asked

3229.79 --> 3234.23
him a question and it was a mistaken

3231.38 --> 3237.02
question I was just wondering hey I was

3234.23 --> 3240.41
presuming he smokes and I was just

3237.02 --> 3242.45
asking how much but that was based on a

3240.41 --> 3246.3799999999997
wrong assumption namely that he dots the

3242.45 --> 3249.589
smoke and it was an honest mistake you

3246.38 --> 3253.55
know just I just possibly ask questions

3249.589 --> 3257.0499999999997
sometimes with people that I don't

3253.55 --> 3267.5890000000004
connect to all that well like they'll so

3257.05 --> 3270.71
no harm meant anyway that was just way

3267.589 --> 3273.68
too paranoid and it's very odd when he

3270.71 --> 3276.29
shows photos of himself as a little kid

3273.68 --> 3284.89
and then it calls himself a young God

3276.29 --> 3284.89
and all that seems a bit wrong

3294.57 --> 3303.3300000000004
it push your pool nope

3300.75 --> 3308.91
I think push-and-pull fall under

3303.33 --> 3310.86
mechanical displacement and I don't

3308.91 --> 3314.43
think there's such a thing as within the

3310.86 --> 3316.53
relative density theory and gravity

3314.43 --> 3318.48
suggest something like that that's

3316.53 --> 3321.84
completely irrelevant because gravity is

3318.48 --> 3324.27
not a thing it's an aberration it's a

3321.84 --> 3326.04
bunch of side effects that heavily

3324.27 --> 3330.84
suggests there is a unified force

3326.04 --> 3335.67
disequilibrium going on which if there

3330.84 --> 3337.29
were would be a push lab just kidding it

3335.67 --> 3340.05
wouldn't matter push or pull it's all

3337.29 --> 3342.59
relative it's all its push pull is the

3340.05 --> 3345.48
mechanical description for displacement

3342.59 --> 3347.58
the fact is there's displacement and the

3345.48 --> 3352.07
cause of that displacement can be proven

3347.58 --> 3352.0699999999997
to be relative density disequilibrium

3356.29 --> 3362.56
and there is no pusher pool it displaces

3358.75 --> 3369.94
it it moves towards its relative density

3362.56 --> 3372.07
equilibrium point no push no pour so

3369.94 --> 3376.38
that's a relative approach it's not

3372.07 --> 3376.38
relevant to the phenomena

3384.79 --> 3388.96
I'm sure it does Daniel

3416.44 --> 3421.4900000000002
yeah Bar Nona it's just that

3419.5 --> 3424.329
apparently a lot of the flat-earthers

3421.49 --> 3426.769
that have wrenches normally are probably

3424.329 --> 3429.2000000000003
now on the panel at the Flat Earth

3426.769 --> 3431.0589999999997
debates because they were in my chat

3429.2 --> 3433.43
earlier but now

3431.059 --> 3436.099
fyodor dostoyevsky is the only one with

3433.43 --> 3438.109
a wrench currently but I don't mind I'm

3436.099 --> 3440.65
paying attention so I will moderate if

3438.109 --> 3440.65
necessary

3455.74 --> 3459.4799999999996
oh my god Wiggles

3466.339 --> 3476.119
that's ridiculous first off 1d space is

3471.949 --> 3479.619
a purely conceptual medium as in it

3476.119 --> 3484.969
there is never been proven to exist

3479.619 --> 3490.099
literally and in that conceptual medium

3484.969 --> 3493.16
a force doesn't make any sense because

3490.099 --> 3495.789
there's no force requires matter matter

3493.16 --> 3498.949
is 3d

3495.789 --> 3503.2090000000003
you can't even claim anything to be a

3498.949 --> 3506.15
force within the concept of 1d realm so

3503.209 --> 3510.1299999999997
the entire setup you presume is totally

3506.15 --> 3510.13
ridiculous and out of proportion

3516.369 --> 3523.4500000000003
yeah well thanks but you gave me the

3521.259 --> 3526.119
wrong description because forces don't

3523.45 --> 3529.779
apply to anything other than the 3d

3526.119 --> 3534.329
realm Wiggles that's the only place

3529.779 --> 3538.21
where we can even confirm that it exists

3534.329 --> 3541.059
and whatever is speculated in this

3538.21 --> 3544.799
multifractal kind of thinking so nice

3541.059 --> 3552.4300000000003
and well but Einstein tried to do that

3544.799 --> 3554.89
it doesn't really help anyone just makes

3552.43 --> 3558.39
you wander off into distractions that

3554.89 --> 3558.39
you'll never be able to prove so

3570.22 --> 3579.3599999999997
I don't think anything about geese a

3574.48 --> 3579.36
copy I think he's dead and that's it

3599.21 --> 3604.78
Hey okay what right he called me what's

3602.599 --> 3604.78
this

3618.66 --> 3625.99
hey I'll do how's it going yeah doing

3623.71 --> 3628.93
great I was actually gonna run out to

3625.99 --> 3631.8999999999996
show what you call me I did yeah just

3628.93 --> 3632.89
that but chat we're see how things are

3631.9 --> 3634.81
going all right

3632.89 --> 3636.4
so you hold and fought down on your own

3634.81 --> 3640.08
for a full hour it's pretty tough to do

3636.4 --> 3643.7200000000003
that you know wha it all depends on um

3640.08 --> 3647.5299999999997
my approach like I have Friday I had two

3643.72 --> 3650.41
and a half hour show it's just that I'm

3647.53 --> 3654.1000000000004
really used to quit immediately after

3650.41 --> 3659.62
the baits start but yeah I have my

3654.1 --> 3660.66
doubts about that now so I know I might

3659.62 --> 3663.04
do it more often

3660.66 --> 3669.37
what [ __ ] what's the problem with the

3663.04 --> 3673.09
debate well I'm outgrowing it that's the

3669.37 --> 3677.5
problem with the debates I think you've

3673.09 --> 3681.55
had similar issues yeah well I mean

3677.5 --> 3685.03
there's only so much non debate you can

3681.55 --> 3686.6800000000003
have it becomes an anon debate that's

3685.03 --> 3688.6000000000004
the way it doesn't feel like it's a

3686.68 --> 3694.39
debate anymore all right it's mostly

3688.6 --> 3697.5099999999998
recycling old stuff and yeah it's

3694.39 --> 3704.3199999999997
getting really old certain individuals

3697.51 --> 3706.8700000000003
especially like Brenda just it's it

3704.32 --> 3709.42
would be interesting to maybe try and do

3706.87 --> 3711.58
a voice recording of everything she says

3709.42 --> 3714.76
and then literally put it next to one

3711.58 --> 3716.83
another and you might up literally being

3714.76 --> 3718.6600000000003
able to copy paste and most of the

3716.83 --> 3720.94
things that she said over one another

3718.66 --> 3724.42
and it would sound perfectly synchronous

3720.94 --> 3727.38
because she's such a drone says things

3724.42 --> 3727.38
the same way every time

3730.86 --> 3736.09
yes I mean don't get me wrong it's good

3734.26 --> 3738.4900000000002
for what it does it has an audience you

3736.09 --> 3742.2400000000002
know but we're not learning anything new

3738.49 --> 3743.95
I mean it was they reacted a little just

3742.24 --> 3744.4599999999996
boils down to the scientific proof and

3743.95 --> 3745.93
yeah

3744.46 --> 3747.91
we can bash them around the head all day

3745.93 --> 3750.19
long about having no scientific proofs

3747.91 --> 3752.29
of the globe or then again if the globe

3750.19 --> 3754.12
has turned it around and and did the

3752.29 --> 3755.59
same so well they could literally bashes

3754.12 --> 3757.9
round the head and say we've got no

3755.59 --> 3760.06
scientific proof for Flat Earth you know

3757.9 --> 3762.04
it's exactly the same you know it makes

3760.06 --> 3766.21
it makes no difference it's just it is

3762.04 --> 3768.58
very one-sided like I say I mean the you

3766.21 --> 3770.14
can't use a scientific method to to

3768.58 --> 3771.5499999999997
prove the shape of the earth in any

3770.14 --> 3772.87
respect whether it's flat earth well

3771.55 --> 3774.19
birth hollow earth it doesn't make any

3772.87 --> 3776.14
difference you're never going to prove

3774.19 --> 3778.21
the earth scientifically with it so

3776.14 --> 3779.65
obviously going down that route is a

3778.21 --> 3781.45
winning argument but then again it's a

3779.65 --> 3783.4300000000003
winning argument for the globus tomb and

3781.45 --> 3785.56
they could have a similar show that

3783.43 --> 3787.21
invaded Flat Earth is in and then they

3785.56 --> 3788.62
could treat them the same way and they

3787.21 --> 3790.09
would get exactly the same results

3788.62 --> 3792.3399999999997
because you could literally pin it down

3790.09 --> 3795.28
to the scientific proof you know dude

3792.34 --> 3797.44
quantity raisers like this the non

3795.28 --> 3800.8900000000003
sequitur each other like a non sequitur

3797.44 --> 3802.51
that's pretty much what they do but I

3800.89 --> 3803.7999999999997
mean you know I mean it's not knocking

3802.51 --> 3806.53
the show I mean the show has got to

3803.8 --> 3808.09
where it is now from you like me and you

3806.53 --> 3811.09
with regular participants for the

3808.09 --> 3813.13
longest of times you know and I'm still

3811.09 --> 3816.31
happy to jump on now and then but

3813.13 --> 3817.9900000000002
ultimately there's there's nothing you

3816.31 --> 3819.52
know the dolt that they don't want the

3817.99 --> 3821.56
evidence that I've got essentially which

3819.52 --> 3824.17
is optical you know I mean because the

3821.56 --> 3826.5099999999998
moving away from that more to thee to

3824.17 --> 3829.12
the word the phrasing of words and the

3826.51 --> 3831.5800000000004
scientific method so you know producing

3829.12 --> 3834.85
stuff that I produce which is more of

3831.58 --> 3836.3199999999997
the optical stuff and doesn't really fit

3834.85 --> 3838.54
in with the genre that they're going

3836.32 --> 3840.01
down anymore so I see where you go you

3838.54 --> 3842.02
know you do feel a little bit pushed to

3840.01 --> 3844.2400000000002
the side in that respect so alright you

3842.02 --> 3845.62
know I mean the show will continue very

3844.24 --> 3846.4599999999996
well as it is and it is it's absolutely

3845.62 --> 3850.5099999999998
I'm tired

3846.46 --> 3852.82
well I'm feeling well yeah but you know

3850.51 --> 3855.55
like you said you know maybe we just

3852.82 --> 3858.28
need to drift for a different different

3855.55 --> 3860.29
down a different road right I originally

3858.28 --> 3863.2000000000003
wanted to kind of do it on the debates

3860.29 --> 3866.08
but with quantum eraser there it's just

3863.2 --> 3869.22
not possible to do that because I am now

3866.08 --> 3872.77
digging into quantum mechanics and and

3869.22 --> 3876.0899999999997
he doesn't tolerate that he gets in the

3872.77 --> 3876.09
way every time I bring it up

3876.45 --> 3883.21
yeah it's like I say he has taken over

3880.24 --> 3885.0699999999997
the show in some respects it's like you

3883.21 --> 3887.05
know if you hit if he was gonna do if

3885.07 --> 3888.82
you had a quantum eraser on for instance

3887.05 --> 3890.9500000000003
and he said oh how can we find quantum

3888.82 --> 3892.7200000000003
eraser you know what what channel is

3890.95 --> 3894.04
your name you know you could literally

3892.72 --> 3896.68
just link it to next and hopefully

3894.04 --> 3899.11
channel and say this is the channel the

3896.68 --> 3900.58
quantum eraser because he doesn't do

3899.11 --> 3903.19
anything on his own channel you know he

3900.58 --> 3904.96
does it on Nathan and Nathan looks like

3903.19 --> 3907.33
you know because like he's always said

3904.96 --> 3909.31
he said you know the least work he does

3907.33 --> 3910.5099999999998
the better you know more people do more

3909.31 --> 3913.2999999999997
work and he doesn't have to do any

3910.51 --> 3915.1000000000004
that's great and you can't you can't

3913.3 --> 3916.27
knock the guy for having that the loss

3915.1 --> 3918.13
of people the people are willing to

3916.27 --> 3920.23
carry the heavy load and do all the work

3918.13 --> 3922.7200000000003
then and you can sit down and you know

3920.23 --> 3925.84
benefit from that why not you know right

3922.72 --> 3927.72
and you know so with quantum yeah he's

3925.84 --> 3930.46
got some great points he puts a lots of

3927.72 --> 3934.54
effort into his presentations for sure

3930.46 --> 3937.2400000000002
he goes through every Globo presentation

3934.54 --> 3939.55
or different channel presentation a bit

3937.24 --> 3941.9199999999996
by a bit mine you to the to the to the

3939.55 --> 3945.79
wording even you know and he picks it

3941.92 --> 3947.29
apart he disseminate it look again it's

3945.79 --> 3950.17
just to play on words if you think about

3947.29 --> 3952.21
it it's not taken contextually as the

3950.17 --> 3954.58
whole meaning of the the entire argument

3952.21 --> 3956.98
you know it's it's broken down into his

3954.58 --> 3960.13
comment into its little part basically

3956.98 --> 3963.13
and I don't think that's I don't think

3960.13 --> 3965.59
that format is gonna wash too well with

3963.13 --> 3967.27
the globe is much longer so essentially

3965.59 --> 3969.55
we will get an audience of people and

3967.27 --> 3973.09
you'll probably keep getting is 300 350

3969.55 --> 3975.13
people watching or whatever oh I can't

3973.09 --> 3977.17
see it growing much more than that

3975.13 --> 3979.7200000000003
because the little cover point where

3977.17 --> 3981.64
people just say hey you know what it's

3979.72 --> 3983.98
the same show it's the same show day

3981.64 --> 3987.58
right well no on the other hand there is

3983.98 --> 3990.4900000000002
he does have kind of a market it I don't

3987.58 --> 3993.04
want to be negative about it but he has

3990.49 --> 3996.0899999999997
kind of built his own unique Jerry

3993.04 --> 3998.95
Springer Show and don't underestimate

3996.09 --> 4002.9100000000003
how freaking popular that was at the

3998.95 --> 4006.5099999999998
time okay so and it is really like that

4002.91 --> 4008.85
that it can definitely be approached as

4006.51 --> 4009.42
easy amusement people just arguing like

4008.85 --> 4012.0299999999997
crazy

4009.42 --> 4015.12
that's very amusing for a lot of people

4012.03 --> 4016.7400000000002
to just like walk in and just see like

4015.12 --> 4021.45
oh haha they're at it again and walk

4016.74 --> 4023.6699999999996
away and so despite their not being a

4021.45 --> 4025.3799999999997
huge amount of progress and development

4023.67 --> 4027.4500000000003
at some point there will still be these

4025.38 --> 4029.28
people that will just know like oh yeah

4027.45 --> 4033.0
they always go at each other there let's

4029.28 --> 4034.38
see what's going on we can say caught

4033.0 --> 4036.75
you can't knock the amount of work that

4034.38 --> 4038.82
QE port Sydney Carton och his delivery

4036.75 --> 4043.53
his deliveries excellent it's on point

4038.82 --> 4044.82
he's very witty in his delivery and you

4043.53 --> 4046.59
know he always brings the winning

4044.82 --> 4049.77
arguments but essentially he could have

4046.59 --> 4052.6200000000003
a QE on the other side of the argument

4049.77 --> 4054.87
another QE Winston to who acted exactly

4052.62 --> 4057.99
the same or turned it around on flat

4054.87 --> 4059.58
earthers using the same same store and

4057.99 --> 4061.3799999999997
saying exactly the same so it's

4059.58 --> 4063.18
literally equals you can word it

4061.38 --> 4066.35
slightly differently and apply it to

4063.18 --> 4068.79
both sides really because like I say me

4066.35 --> 4070.65
for instance well Buster's for instance

4068.79 --> 4073.44
you know they would work on probability

4070.65 --> 4075.21
rather than scientific proof you know

4073.44 --> 4077.13
and I think that's how progress is made

4075.21 --> 4080.01
essentially it's like you know you look

4077.13 --> 4085.76
at the laws of what's the most probable

4080.01 --> 4089.9100000000003
with 999,999 whatever out of the million

4085.76 --> 4092.5800000000004
it is one against one well you can take

4089.91 --> 4094.56
the you know the largest percentage is

4092.58 --> 4096.09
probably be in the most accurate you

4094.56 --> 4098.13
know you don't have to have definitive

4096.09 --> 4102.06
proof you know but you can have a good

4098.13 --> 4104.06
indication of stuff look an Indic it's

4102.06 --> 4107.820000000001
on there are several steps and

4104.06 --> 4111.6
definitely an estimation of finding a

4107.82 --> 4113.7
viable course to pursue requires yeah

4111.6 --> 4116.280000000001
the the chance estimation as you

4113.7 --> 4119.46
described but that's not the end of it

4116.28 --> 4122.91
because if you don't actually then find

4119.46 --> 4125.43
some empirical evidence to so confirm

4122.91 --> 4128.16
that directly then it's just gonna be

4125.43 --> 4133.110000000001
like good I got this idea just like

4128.16 --> 4134.79
Einstein did you know like I say I mean

4133.11 --> 4136.44
we're never gonna get scientific proof

4134.79 --> 4138.12
for the shape of the earth we're never

4136.44 --> 4140.429999999999
gonna get that I mean the only way we're

4138.12 --> 4141.409
really gonna get it is when we actually

4140.43 --> 4143.929
get into a

4141.409 --> 4145.759
craft of some sort and see how high we

4143.929 --> 4147.2300000000005
can go and now that we're gonna go high

4145.759 --> 4149.179
enough where we can look back and see

4147.23 --> 4151.04
the entire shape of the planet that's

4149.179 --> 4152.96
still nice that's not scientific

4151.04 --> 4155.96
evidence though all we're going to hit

4152.96 --> 4157.819
something you know or we're just gonna

4155.96 --> 4161.0
blow whichever we're just never gonna

4157.819 --> 4163.299
get anything unless we can look back at

4161.0 --> 4166.279
where we live with eyes that are

4163.299 --> 4168.409
controlled by anyone other than the

4166.279 --> 4171.139
camera ya know the camera just shows it

4168.409 --> 4173.888999999999
as it is right no interference just this

4171.139 --> 4176.359
is where we live you know seen from say

4173.889 --> 4179.150000000001
provided we can get that high let's say

4176.359 --> 4181.069
we could go to 5,000 miles away let's

4179.15 --> 4182.87
suppose and we could go that far if we

4181.069 --> 4185.179
have a cord and we could look back and

4182.87 --> 4187.0689999999995
take a look at it we'll either hit

4185.179 --> 4189.35
something on the way up the ladder blow

4187.069 --> 4190.609
up or we'll get there so it's one of

4189.35 --> 4192.5
these you know it's one of those things

4190.609 --> 4194.659000000001
because trying to rely on the scientific

4192.5 --> 4196.4
method it's just not going to work but

4194.659 --> 4198.62
then again you can apply a lot of other

4196.4 --> 4200.388999999999
things the dot they exclude the

4198.62 --> 4202.5199999999995
scientific method but there also a

4200.389 --> 4203.87
correlation of other things that can

4202.52 --> 4207.469
lead you in a direction

4203.87 --> 4209.989
yeah geometrical deductions empirical

4207.469 --> 4213.08
based day data and then just putting it

4209.989 --> 4217.699
together and yeah that's what I've been

4213.08 --> 4220.28
doing that science is just not look the

4217.699 --> 4222.44
the problem is not even that Earth's

4220.28 --> 4225.92
shape cannot be scientifically proven

4222.44 --> 4228.53
the problem is is that people are made

4225.92 --> 4230.63
to believe that science the scientific

4228.53 --> 4234.29
method could actually prove anything

4230.63 --> 4238.6900000000005
like that that's the real problem it's

4234.29 --> 4242.2699999999995
the complete disc on torsion of science

4238.69 --> 4245.78
into nonsense and that that is allowed

4242.27 --> 4248.63
that it is accepted that is the bit that

4245.78 --> 4250.5199999999995
is the biggest problem we got and you

4248.63 --> 4256.96
find it everywhere you find the symptoms

4250.52 --> 4260.830000000001
everywhere I'm just gonna respond to a

4256.96 --> 4265.07
message from peach no god are you sure

4260.83 --> 4268.699
yeah which one hang on wait a minute

4265.07 --> 4271.36
he's talking about wide awake so I just

4268.699 --> 4273.86
want to put him in touch with this

4271.36 --> 4275.03
presentation that somebody did this this

4273.86 --> 4280.099999999999
video

4275.03 --> 4283.67
and here we go so let me get the video

4280.1 --> 4287.54
up actually you could play this are you

4283.67 --> 4292.25
sure yeah yeah yeah you can play this

4287.54 --> 4295.43
jump it asunder you in Skype you know

4292.25 --> 4305.84
you could present it perhaps you're

4295.43 --> 4307.31
already on screen so yeah so I open up

4305.84 --> 4307.85
another one hang on just I get this

4307.31 --> 4312.830000000001
right

4307.85 --> 4321.29
um new window right boom here we go pop

4312.83 --> 4322.67
that over there paste that go this is

4321.29 --> 4325.04
gonna intro speech oh you might have

4322.67 --> 4326.45
seen this video and I don't know I doubt

4325.04 --> 4330.98
it

4326.45 --> 4334.79
let's get my screen sharing share screen

4330.98 --> 4339.139999999999
boom stop sharing right tell me when you

4334.79 --> 4340.5199999999995
can see this yep okay so you're gonna

4339.14 --> 4342.860000000001
like this actually because it gives you

4340.52 --> 4346.34
this kind of angle so what he's done

4342.86 --> 4348.469999999999
here is he's put a flat table together

4346.34 --> 4349.76
and it is a really flat table it's a

4348.47 --> 4351.650000000001
solid probably inch and a half thick

4349.76 --> 4354.08
piece of wood that he's laid across

4351.65 --> 4355.49
these to tailor these two chairs and

4354.08 --> 4360.32
what he's done is he's built this ramp

4355.49 --> 4362.24
and it's it's angled ever so slightly to

4360.32 --> 4363.74
give you an effect of the mood water

4362.24 --> 4367.07
layer so this is a mirror that he's

4363.74 --> 4370.73
gonna push up and he's going to use some

4367.07 --> 4373.13
kind of representation of a bolt as he

4370.73 --> 4374.36
pushes into it so let me see if I can

4373.13 --> 4376.82
get to the point where he actually

4374.36 --> 4380.179999999999
starts doing this so here we go

4376.82 --> 4384.37
let's put it on full screen so it's

4380.18 --> 4387.35
gonna push into it and push into it and

4384.37 --> 4389.51
what I simulating here is the is like

4387.35 --> 4392.06
the evaporative properties of the water

4389.51 --> 4394.7
so you've got the evaporation going on

4392.06 --> 4396.29
over a distance and it builds up and it

4394.7 --> 4398.09
builds up and the further you're looking

4396.29 --> 4399.74
away from yourself near the boat the

4398.09 --> 4403.24
further the boat is away you're looking

4399.74 --> 4405.26
over a thicker mirrored water layer so

4403.24 --> 4407.03
what will happen is he's gonna be

4405.26 --> 4408.530000000001
simulating the bolt being pushed further

4407.03 --> 4408.83
away in the moment you'll get to see

4408.53 --> 4412.19
there

4408.83 --> 4415.85
you're gonna push it and this is exactly

4412.19 --> 4420.469999999999
what you see when you look in through

4415.85 --> 4422.33
the p1000 or the p900 which other and it

4420.47 --> 4424.76
is it's a pretty you know it's a pretty

4422.33 --> 4427.97
spot-on example in my opinion of what

4424.76 --> 4432.17
actually happens and I can see it

4427.97 --> 4435.41
actually happening I totally agree it's

4432.17 --> 4438.62
a really good one that's what he's doing

4435.41 --> 4440.78
it yeah flat flat mirror surface and

4438.62 --> 4442.2699999999995
that's where we see that's the merit the

4440.78 --> 4444.94
Marashi effect

4442.27 --> 4447.71
well this object that is pushing is

4444.94 --> 4449.629999999999
staying flat at the table and his camera

4447.71 --> 4452.15
is fixed at the same height the only

4449.63 --> 4455.87
thing that is adjusting is the thickness

4452.15 --> 4458.389999999999
of the of the water layer so obviously

4455.87 --> 4460.55
we know evaporation happens over over

4458.39 --> 4462.650000000001
water we know evaporation happens so

4460.55 --> 4463.97
over a long distance if you're looking

4462.65 --> 4466.429999999999
through say miles and miles of

4463.97 --> 4469.7300000000005
evaporation it's gonna create this fake

4466.43 --> 4472.070000000001
watered mirror layer right what is

4469.73 --> 4474.7699999999995
simulating here is the bowl in the

4472.07 --> 4476.24
distance behind the atmosphere so again

4474.77 --> 4479.09
this is still atmospheres this is the

4476.24 --> 4481.04
true horizon down here this is this is

4479.09 --> 4483.53
the mirrored water layer there's the

4481.04 --> 4485.21
bowl and because of this mirrored water

4483.53 --> 4487.07
layer we're getting this effect of the

4485.21 --> 4489.14
inferior Mirage now this is exactly what

4487.07 --> 4491.59
I've been saying that it happens in the

4489.14 --> 4494.570000000001
atmosphere and it could be caused by

4491.59 --> 4497.27
evaporation stuff like this and this

4494.57 --> 4501.95
demonstration shows it really really

4497.27 --> 4503.4800000000005
well the channel name is no fanfare if

4501.95 --> 4507.74
anybody's interested in going and having

4503.48 --> 4511.639999999999
a look at this video just just really

4507.74 --> 4513.83
good really good fascinating it's

4511.64 --> 4518.54
fascinating that it can be so lively

4513.83 --> 4521.45
emulated in a really small scale it

4518.54 --> 4524.21
really does like it's kind of funny

4521.45 --> 4526.04
though because remember my optical

4524.21 --> 4529.19
explanation the optical slant with a

4526.04 --> 4531.65
yeah with a slice out of sight well that

4529.19 --> 4533.78
mirror is basically literally the slice

4531.65 --> 4538.45
insula is moving up over the distance

4533.78 --> 4541.32
now so this is perfect

4538.45 --> 4543.36
bizarre that it works that way though

4541.32 --> 4544.799999999999
and he's pushing it back so he's pushing

4543.36 --> 4546.9
it back so it's going through less of

4544.8 --> 4548.9400000000005
this mirror or the optical slamming last

4546.9 --> 4550.7699999999995
of this mirrored water layer and it gets

4548.94 --> 4552.419999999999
near a two-year it's going through less

4550.77 --> 4555.120000000001
of it so the mirrored water layer is

4552.42 --> 4556.71
lower down however it is still on an

4555.12 --> 4560.04
angle so you know we're talking about

4556.71 --> 4563.19
angles so let's go back to thee to the

4560.04 --> 4565.2
actual setup here so he's got this angle

4563.19 --> 4566.58
going off and this angle going up on

4565.2 --> 4569.07
both sides so this is where it's gonna

4566.58 --> 4571.71
push the mirror up well let's just say

4569.07 --> 4573.57
that give it an arbitrary 5 degrees

4571.71 --> 4575.67
let's just say it's set to 5 degrees

4573.57 --> 4578.19
well it's five degrees the entire way

4575.67 --> 4580.17
it's 5 degrees at the very start and

4578.19 --> 4581.639999999999
it's 5 degrees at halfway at it's five

4580.17 --> 4584.67
degrees at the very end it's still just

4581.64 --> 4586.530000000001
a 5 degree angle but the further away he

4584.67 --> 4588.81
goes the deeper he goes into the

4586.53 --> 4592.889999999999
mirrored water layer because he's going

4588.81 --> 4594.96
further away so the the angle creeps up

4592.89 --> 4598.5
higher and higher and higher up the bowl

4594.96 --> 4601.53
it's exactly what we've been saying it's

4598.5 --> 4604.11
really cool so just awesome I love this

4601.53 --> 4606.96
and pumpkin don't be such a complaining

4604.11 --> 4608.28
pants is a great video I'm very glad you

4606.96 --> 4612.24
brought this to my attention it's

4608.28 --> 4614.73
awesome it's almost so good that you

4612.24 --> 4619.44
could now probably do miniatures for

4614.73 --> 4620.879999999999
movies you know over the sea well this

4619.44 --> 4623.28
needs to I think this needs to be

4620.88 --> 4626.52
expanded upon this type of presentation

4623.28 --> 4628.08
because it demonstrates very very very

4626.52 --> 4630.900000000001
well what we've been saying right it's

4628.08 --> 4632.82
emulation it's emulation smalls putting

4630.9 --> 4636.32
it down to scale and that's really how

4632.82 --> 4638.849999999999
you figure out a lot of the more complex

4636.32 --> 4641.549999999999
observations it's also what is

4638.85 --> 4645.51
absolutely necessary in my opinion in my

4641.55 --> 4647.900000000001
view to eventually prove how those

4645.51 --> 4651.360000000001
lights of the globe of the heavens are

4647.9 --> 4655.11
visible how that works it could probably

4651.36 --> 4657.12
only be emulated so maybe somebody is

4655.11 --> 4660.03
gonna like figure it out so some kind of

4657.12 --> 4661.95
setup that manna videos that we have a

4660.03 --> 4666.0599999999995
mini camera at the center and actually

4661.95 --> 4669.2699999999995
see very much like we see he's got that

4666.06 --> 4670.8
he's done a presentation I think it was

4669.27 --> 4673.070000000001
him that did a presentation let me just

4670.8 --> 4673.070000000001
see

4673.81 --> 4680.71
Oh crikey once all these videos sort by

4676.71 --> 4682.21
oldest first it might not be him that's

4680.71 --> 4684.31
done it to be fair because I think it

4682.21 --> 4688.33
was about two or three years ago and he

4684.31 --> 4692.110000000001
created this black jar that was

4688.33 --> 4694.54
simulating you know all the all the

4692.11 --> 4697.36
celestial bodies and he's able to

4694.54 --> 4699.67
demonstrate spinning in the southern

4697.36 --> 4701.71
hemisphere a different spinning in the

4699.67 --> 4703.75
northern hemisphere interesting okay

4701.71 --> 4706.89
that's a good start although that can

4703.75 --> 4712.45
also already be done pretty much in any

4706.89 --> 4716.4400000000005
what is it the name the planetarium they

4712.45 --> 4725.5199999999995
can also do that pretty well by the way

4716.44 --> 4728.049999999999
actually um the channel must have a look

4725.52 --> 4729.790000000001
videos it was of something from about

4728.05 --> 4738.55
three years ago I remember that I am

4729.79 --> 4740.38
sort by oldest no hmm there was no

4738.55 --> 4741.91
there's only a year ago so that the

4740.38 --> 4746.29
video that I watched was definitely

4741.91 --> 4749.82
about a year ago and that doesn't look

4746.29 --> 4756.21
like the original wide awake actually

4749.82 --> 4756.21
maybe it is mm-hmm bang uest

4757.77 --> 4762.820000000001
you know that doesn't look like that

4759.78 --> 4768.849999999999
maybe he maybe we'll save that for

4762.82 --> 4771.219999999999
another time but it's interesting look I

4768.85 --> 4774.160000000001
even remember seeing something like that

4771.22 --> 4776.47
a long time ago before the freaking

4774.16 --> 4779.47
Internet somebody built something and

4776.47 --> 4784.42
then it looked very much like the globe

4779.47 --> 4787.39
of the heavens but in a small yeah I

4784.42 --> 4792.28
know let me see I mean this guy does an

4787.39 --> 4795.06
awful lot of work I have to say yeah

4792.28 --> 4795.0599999999995
lots of videos

4795.28 --> 4807.88
and I need to bring it up immediately

4805.75 --> 4810.57
I like looking through all this what you

4807.88 --> 4811.93
liked it to have a talk with Brenda

4810.57 --> 4814.42
water

4811.93 --> 4818.25
this is yes and ask me again if she

4814.42 --> 4820.81
wants to go it invite me in please

4818.25 --> 4824.92
that breaker I'm serious

4820.81 --> 4826.75
yeah bring her up okay let's see what

4824.92 --> 4831.64
she's got this time I can always just

4826.75 --> 4835.32
cut it off and round out the show all

4831.64 --> 4835.320000000001
right okay

4845.369 --> 4855.749
hello Brenda

4850.78 --> 4855.749
I think your mic is off

4858.69 --> 4867.04
hello hello can you hear me yes okay

4863.76 --> 4867.31
you're us yeah let's hope yes I can hear

4867.04 --> 4873.01
you

4867.31 --> 4876.490000000001
good so what brings you here oh you

4873.01 --> 4879.34
still I was wondering I was hoping to

4876.49 --> 4882.58
talk to you and Ryan tea um but okay

4879.34 --> 4885.07
Randy's still here I can't hear him he's

4882.58 --> 4889.21
not talking oh okay

4885.07 --> 4892.57
hello Brenda good good morning good

4889.21 --> 4896.44
afternoon yeah so the the demonstration

4892.57 --> 4901.0599999999995
that you had there doesn't represent the

4896.44 --> 4903.19
Flat Earth why isn't it because the

4901.06 --> 4906.13
mirror isn't flat oh really

4903.19 --> 4909.299999999999
isn't it huh well no the mirror was

4906.13 --> 4912.31
angled to simulate the effect of

4909.3 --> 4915.04
atmosphere and the effects of the

4912.31 --> 4917.68
evaporation happening as a gradual

4915.04 --> 4920.41
percentage over distance Brenda yeah

4917.68 --> 4923.41
yeah yeah so it's it doesn't represent

4920.41 --> 4925.599999999999
reality it doesn't represent the reality

4923.41 --> 4927.099999999999
on a flat earth it's an emulation and

4925.6 --> 4929.29
I'm pretty sure the mirror was not

4927.1 --> 4931.54
curved it was a flat mirror and looked

4929.29 --> 4933.46
very much like the real observations

4931.54 --> 4935.8
that Randy has done with the camera in

4933.46 --> 4938.71
the real world so that was the point

4935.8 --> 4939.85
it's an emulation yeah but it's not flat

4938.71 --> 4944.11
oh really

4939.85 --> 4946.96
so branti was that mirror curved no it

4944.11 --> 4949.0
was a flat mirror yeah but it's not flat

4946.96 --> 4951.84
it doesn't that's flat on a flat plane

4949.0 --> 4955.48
it doesn't travel on a flat plane oh

4951.84 --> 4958.360000000001
it's the boat was on a flat plane and

4955.48 --> 4960.49
the camera was set level looking at the

4958.36 --> 4963.94
boat the only thing that changed was the

4960.49 --> 4967.45
ramping up of the mirror to simulate to

4963.94 --> 4972.339999999999
simulate as you do in experiments to

4967.45 --> 4974.429999999999
simulate the effects of evaporation so

4972.34 --> 4977.860000000001
does everybody run around with these

4974.43 --> 4980.59
ramp ramps in their eyes is that what

4977.86 --> 4982.15
you think then because two different two

4980.59 --> 4984.52
different observers from different

4982.15 --> 4987.25
points of view would would see it

4984.52 --> 4989.47
differently so how do how does how in

4987.25 --> 4990.679
physical reality are all these different

4989.47 --> 4993.5
ramps

4990.679 --> 4994.909
around in in the real world that's the

4993.5 --> 4997.79
moist that's the whole point

4994.909 --> 5000.849999999999
it's the moist the moist losses this

4997.79 --> 5002.86
let's have some questions and so Brenda

5000.85 --> 5005.679
do you know the evaporation happens over

5002.86 --> 5010.32
the oceans no well of course it does do

5005.679 --> 5013.6
you know the water is reflective yeah

5010.32 --> 5019.69
okay so yeah so if you're looking across

5013.6 --> 5021.31
a humid with lots of evaporated you've

5019.69 --> 5024.07
got a humid area with lots of your

5021.31 --> 5026.429
vaporators going on would you expect to

5024.07 --> 5030.699
see some kind of mirrored reflection

5026.429 --> 5035.65
yeah on the water which is is the water

5030.699 --> 5038.0199999999995
flat yes yeah so so why isn't it flat in

5035.65 --> 5041.589999999999
your demonstration because it isn't the

5038.02 --> 5044.7390000000005
mirror it is all Adam but when it's not

5041.59 --> 5046.84
curved Brenda its flat is the is the

5044.739 --> 5049.0599999999995
boat in the demonstration on the water

5046.84 --> 5053.5
or is it on something else it's on the

5049.06 --> 5056.14
water then why isn't the mirror a flat

5053.5 --> 5058.719
on the water why is it up in the air oh

5056.14 --> 5061.780000000001
you mean parallel you know parallel to

5058.719 --> 5064.15
the water it's not it's not curved

5061.78 --> 5068.409
Brenda it's still flat it's just not

5064.15 --> 5070.36
parallel flat earth on the flat earth if

5068.409 --> 5074.259999999999
its water that's causing the mirroring

5070.36 --> 5080.5599999999995
effect you know represent that the

5074.26 --> 5082.6900000000005
mirror should be no it's the evaporation

5080.56 --> 5087.159000000001
Brenda that's causing the mirror

5082.69 --> 5090.339999999999
reflection so it's an the water it's the

5087.159 --> 5092.469
water not the evaporation no it's the no

5090.34 --> 5095.679
it's my presentation and it's his

5092.469 --> 5098.08
presentation and we so we already have

5095.679 --> 5099.9400000000005
assumed and put the mirror there to

5098.08 --> 5103.2699999999995
simulate the atmosphere and the

5099.94 --> 5106.239
atmospheric reflection of evaporation of

5103.27 --> 5108.88
water above the water which actually

5106.239 --> 5111.459999999999
isn't a water so it's the evaporation in

5108.88 --> 5113.26
this atmospheric so we're both quite an

5111.46 --> 5115.57
agreement with this is the presentation

5113.26 --> 5118.3
that's being shown to you and you're now

5115.57 --> 5119.949
trying to say that no that's the the

5118.3 --> 5122.62
water itself right

5119.949 --> 5124.54
you know if it's the water that is

5122.62 --> 5126.82
mirroring light then

5124.54 --> 5129.25
the mirror in your demonstration needs

5126.82 --> 5132.04
to be perfectly flat and level with the

5129.25 --> 5135.22
table but that's not how the effect is

5132.04 --> 5138.34
manifesting so we're not claiming that

5135.22 --> 5140.650000000001
there's water vapor giving a literal

5138.34 --> 5142.57
mirror hanging parallel to the water no

5140.65 --> 5144.5199999999995
there is a distance

5142.57 --> 5147.34
there's an old on Brenda there is a

5144.52 --> 5151.6900000000005
distance relation effect going on

5147.34 --> 5156.04
so the mirroring aggravates the further

5151.69 --> 5157.719999999999
you go yes well there is effectively

5156.04 --> 5161.47
putting it at a slant

5157.72 --> 5163.45
remember the optical slant yes there is

5161.47 --> 5166.4800000000005
that's enough it's a description of the

5163.45 --> 5170.5
observation yes it is yeah in normal

5166.48 --> 5174.4
circumstances when when you have say a

5170.5 --> 5177.25
warm surface like like the surface of

5174.4 --> 5181.54
the ocean you get a evaporation and that

5177.25 --> 5185.92
causes a layer of warmed water above a

5181.54 --> 5189.67
warmed air above the water which is what

5185.92 --> 5192.4
causes a mirage but that layer of warm

5189.67 --> 5195.16
air just above the surface of the ocean

5192.4 --> 5197.5599999999995
it's going to remain flat and level with

5195.16 --> 5200.349999999999
the ocean yeah you have it you have it

5197.56 --> 5202.84
climbing up in the air and that doesn't

5200.35 --> 5206.08
represent physical reality because what

5202.84 --> 5208.0
you see is not a geometrical

5206.08 --> 5210.22
representation it's not autographic view

5208.0 --> 5214.36
based there's perspective at play and

5210.22 --> 5216.280000000001
again the distance to that layer has an

5214.36 --> 5217.99
influence as to how it's going to

5216.28 --> 5220.8099999999995
reflect things so the further away you

5217.99 --> 5224.08
go the higher up the reflection

5220.81 --> 5226.0
effectively starts okay so Wiggles makes

5224.08 --> 5228.15
a very good point he says can you

5226.0 --> 5231.37
explain to Brenda that the table

5228.15 --> 5236.469999999999
represents the water not right a mirror

5231.37 --> 5239.0199999999995
not the mirror all right so you do want

5236.47 --> 5241.93
them I do understand that yeah so the

5239.02 --> 5245.580000000001
reflective layer represents what the

5241.93 --> 5248.62
mirror represents what evaporation yes

5245.58 --> 5252.13
the effect so the observed effect it's

5248.62 --> 5254.7699999999995
an emulation of the observation no it's

5252.13 --> 5256.66
what physically does the mirror

5254.77 --> 5259.580000000001
represent

5256.66 --> 5261.92
evaporating water Brenda that reflects

5259.58 --> 5263.66
in Spanish conditions so is there a

5261.92 --> 5267.65
difference between evaporated water

5263.66 --> 5269.69
which is more gassy than the solid world

5267.65 --> 5272.719999999999
not a solid but the the liquid of the

5269.69 --> 5275.389999999999
ocean does different things yeah so it's

5272.72 --> 5277.58
like but the kettle boiling the kettle

5275.39 --> 5279.38
the water that's in the kettle is the

5277.58 --> 5281.78
water in the kettle and the steam coming

5279.38 --> 5283.61
off of it is the steam so as to know

5281.78 --> 5286.61
things so I will look at this

5283.61 --> 5291.07
presentation the table is the water in

5286.61 --> 5293.96
the kettle and the mirror is the steam

5291.07 --> 5298.87
different separate things completely I

5293.96 --> 5302.21
understand it forms a layer of warm a

5298.87 --> 5305.42
water vapor just above the surface of

5302.21 --> 5308.57
the water but that layer is going to be

5305.42 --> 5309.65
flat and level with the water it's not

5308.57 --> 5313.25
gonna ramp up

5309.65 --> 5317.179999999999
that's correct Brenda the layer is but

5313.25 --> 5320.48
the visual effects is not because that

5317.18 --> 5322.34
is dependent on the distance because

5320.48 --> 5324.98
it's angle is an angle you see that's

5322.34 --> 5327.02
why I made sure to show you the angle it

5324.98 --> 5330.58
was set to roughly 5 degrees and it was

5327.02 --> 5333.830000000001
5 degrees the entire way there was no

5330.58 --> 5336.68
extra angle as it goes further and

5333.83 --> 5338.78
further away it was just a set angle and

5336.68 --> 5340.64
that set angle was able to hide the

5338.78 --> 5344.33
entire boat behind the inferior Mirage

5340.64 --> 5346.9400000000005
so why do you think that as you go

5344.33 --> 5350.48
further away from an object from from

5346.94 --> 5355.219999999999
somebody visually that the layer of

5350.48 --> 5357.62
water warmed water vapor above the the

5355.22 --> 5361.13
wall of the ocean that it gets higher

5357.62 --> 5363.44
and higher because let's supposing

5361.13 --> 5365.39
you're stood three foot away from the

5363.44 --> 5367.849999999999
lamppost and you're trying to look at

5365.39 --> 5370.1
something that's 5% five degree well

5367.85 --> 5371.660000000001
five degrees of the one post and then

5370.1 --> 5373.280000000001
you want to look at Mount Everest and

5371.66 --> 5375.2
you want to work out what five degrees

5373.28 --> 5377.599999999999
of Mount Everest you're going to have

5375.2 --> 5379.58
two different and height values even

5377.6 --> 5381.29
though there's still five degrees you're

5379.58 --> 5384.29
going to have two separate values so

5381.29 --> 5387.8
it's exactly the same render now I don't

5384.29 --> 5389.34
understand that if the lamppost and the

5387.8 --> 5393.81
Mount Everest are

5389.34 --> 5395.610000000001
on a perfectly flat surface there are

5393.81 --> 5398.370000000001
five degrees is five degrees what are

5395.61 --> 5403.62
you talking about can you see mine can

5398.37 --> 5407.13
you see my screen Brenda yeah I can't

5403.62 --> 5410.19
cool right so what we have here is the

5407.13 --> 5411.99
simulation so we have five degrees the

5410.19 --> 5415.65
entire way so it's five degrees the

5411.99 --> 5417.87
entire way well halfway it's maybe let's

5415.65 --> 5420.089999999999
just give it an arbitrary value of say

5417.87 --> 5421.47
two inches in height let's just say it's

5420.09 --> 5422.43
two inches in height we don't know for

5421.47 --> 5425.1900000000005
sure it's two inches

5422.43 --> 5428.91
well it's certainly lower than the end

5425.19 --> 5431.25
of the ramp which is further away but

5428.91 --> 5433.83
it's still on the same angle so it might

5431.25 --> 5436.23
be two inches here but at the end of the

5433.83 --> 5438.36
ramp render it could be four inches even

5436.23 --> 5439.29
though it's still on the same angle does

5438.36 --> 5441.87
that make sense

5439.29 --> 5443.55
at the star zero you won't be able to

5441.87 --> 5445.59
fit this on direct paper underneath that

5443.55 --> 5445.89
but you go a quarter of the way it's an

5445.59 --> 5448.53
inch

5445.89 --> 5450.75
halfway to two inches two-thirds it's

5448.53 --> 5454.59
three inches at the end it's four inches

5450.75 --> 5456.24
yeah I understand it's an ID if there's

5454.59 --> 5459.24
some angle I understand there's an angle

5456.24 --> 5462.66
but what it represents in reality so if

5459.24 --> 5465.48
you was to push this to a mile away then

5462.66 --> 5467.43
it will be able to hide a let's say a

5465.48 --> 5470.3099999999995
house you could have a house hidden

5467.43 --> 5472.530000000001
behind it if you so wish you could hide

5470.31 --> 5474.360000000001
a house it's all to do you know it's an

5472.53 --> 5476.61
angle Brenda doesn't make it angle

5474.36 --> 5479.58
doesn't change so once you've got your

5476.61 --> 5481.98
set angle for the mirrored water layer

5479.58 --> 5485.3099999999995
things get hidden behind it it could be

5481.98 --> 5486.959999999999
warning it could be one degree you know

5485.31 --> 5489.63
this is just a simulation over a very

5486.96 --> 5492.57
short distance it could be a tenth of

5489.63 --> 5495.0
one degree it could be 0.1 of a degree

5492.57 --> 5496.7699999999995
or point zero zero or one of a degree

5495.0 --> 5498.51
doesn't make any difference because that

5496.77 --> 5501.6
will be constant throughout the entire

5498.51 --> 5505.110000000001
footage and eventually a mountain will

5501.6 --> 5509.400000000001
get hidden behind the optical vote what

5505.11 --> 5512.46
does the the angle represent the

5509.4 --> 5521.19
mirrored water layer Brenda for the 55th

5512.46 --> 5522.81
time but on a flash so the table is the

5521.19 --> 5526.589999999999
water in the kettle

5522.81 --> 5528.84
- RAM is the steam so the water that the

5526.59 --> 5533.24
boat is sitting on is the table and the

5528.84 --> 5537.59
evaporation of the water is the ramp

5533.24 --> 5540.51
what we were observing reality it's

5537.59 --> 5543.150000000001
pretty damn close I have to say oh no

5540.51 --> 5545.9400000000005
that's not that's not true oh really oh

5543.15 --> 5548.009999999999
really well I I disagree because this

5545.94 --> 5550.2
looks exactly like some of Ron T's

5548.01 --> 5552.900000000001
footage where he films a boat that's

5550.2 --> 5554.79
moving parallel like that but still

5552.9 --> 5556.589999999999
going into the distance and then that

5554.79 --> 5559.11
mirror line goes up and up and up

5556.59 --> 5562.02
exactly like he's demonstrating here so

5559.11 --> 5565.32
I totally disagree with you I mean

5562.02 --> 5567.450000000001
something else what I mean is is it what

5565.32 --> 5571.049999999999
we observe in reality that there is

5567.45 --> 5573.72
always a small amount of steam coming

5571.05 --> 5575.84
off a boiling kettle when it's close to

5573.72 --> 5583.17
you and it gets higher and higher

5575.84 --> 5585.4800000000005
farther away from you well that's what

5583.17 --> 5588.02
that's what the ramp does it gets higher

5585.48 --> 5594.719999999999
and higher the further away from you

5588.02 --> 5597.27
yeah I know you don't observe anything

5594.72 --> 5599.9400000000005
you don't observe err it's a simulation

5597.27 --> 5600.870000000001
it's not a literal representation of

5599.94 --> 5604.53
that material

5600.87 --> 5607.5
exactly like that okay random it's a

5604.53 --> 5610.469999999999
representation I understand the air in

5607.5 --> 5612.51
of the water in the air layer and this

5610.47 --> 5616.02
is what the effect that comes out of

5612.51 --> 5618.84
that seems to look like like a ramp it's

5616.02 --> 5623.25
not literally around it just looks like

5618.84 --> 5626.82
around if you have if I have a huge a

5623.25 --> 5629.46
very large a 30-foot kettle with hot

5626.82 --> 5632.61
water and the steam is coming off and it

5629.46 --> 5635.34
forms a layer of hot water vapor just

5632.61 --> 5639.21
above the surface of the the water in

5635.34 --> 5643.8
the kettle right how thick is that layer

5639.21 --> 5645.84
going to be when it's close to me versus

5643.8 --> 5649.05
away from me it's going to be let's say

5645.84 --> 5650.88
it's half an inch or even a quarter of

5649.05 --> 5653.04
an inch above the surface of the kettle

5650.88 --> 5653.63
of water it's going to be a quarter of

5653.04 --> 5656.749
an inch

5653.63 --> 5660.38
everywhere on off the surface of that

5656.749 --> 5662.929
it's not going to be ramped up now but

5660.38 --> 5667.28
look what the ramp up really stands for

5662.929 --> 5670.6990000000005
is the accumulating amount of water

5667.28 --> 5672.92
vapor you are looking through because

5670.699 --> 5675.53
the further the distance is the more

5672.92 --> 5678.639
water vapor you are looking through and

5675.53 --> 5682.03
that is what effectively is causing that

5678.639 --> 5687.769
reflection point to increase in height

5682.03 --> 5689.57
yeah that is the effect that is how this

5687.769 --> 5693.499
seems to work because it looks exactly

5689.57 --> 5696.86
like this so the the demonstration

5693.499 --> 5699.289
doesn't represent reality because it has

5696.86 --> 5701.329
the mirror slanting away from from the

5699.289 --> 5704.449
observed yeah we don't you know we are

5701.329 --> 5707.71
not trying to test a reality overlooking

5704.449 --> 5711.228999999999
a literal mirror it's a simulation again

5707.71 --> 5713.619
don't strawman the setup for a literal

5711.229 --> 5716.9890000000005
miniature of reality it's an emulation

5713.619 --> 5721.28
specifically designated to back engineer

5716.989 --> 5724.369
the visual effect pretty successfully

5721.28 --> 5728.659
ask me if you're emulating something you

5724.369 --> 5731.63
have to represent reality you can't

5728.659 --> 5734.21
emulate we're emulating my fact we're

5731.63 --> 5736.55
not emulating the entirety of reality we

5734.21 --> 5739.789
are emulating the effects specifically

5736.55 --> 5743.03
and it's a successful emulation because

5739.789 --> 5746.889
of darkness so if you've got a visual

5743.03 --> 5749.869
image of the solar system or any kind of

5746.889 --> 5752.2390000000005
sort of demonstration that you can show

5749.869 --> 5756.65
us visually of how the solar system

5752.239 --> 5758.78
works yeah you can make physical

5756.65 --> 5762.949
representations of the solar system

5758.78 --> 5765.739
scaled down to something that you can

5762.949 --> 5769.549999999999
see but it's it's very yes people have

5765.739 --> 5772.579
done that right but it likes it's like

5769.55 --> 5775.1900000000005
maybe a grape and abanda and a tennis

5772.579 --> 5777.409
ball inside an auditorium for just two

5775.19 --> 5780.249
planets I mean the solar system is huge

5777.409 --> 5782.388999999999
so you don't have any problem with that

5780.249 --> 5785.239
right because that's a matter of scale

5782.389 --> 5788.479
that's directly scaling down right so

5785.239 --> 5790.249
you know this is maybe this isn't it's

5788.479 --> 5792.38
right on it

5790.249 --> 5795.978999999999
so there's gonna be skill issues so

5792.38 --> 5798.32
that's what it's trying to count for but

5795.979 --> 5800.659000000001
there's no five degree rampion reality

5798.32 --> 5804.59
well effectively there seems to be

5800.659 --> 5807.469
exactly that due to the accumulating

5804.59 --> 5812.59
amount of water vapor you look through

5807.469 --> 5815.78
over distance so yes there is well

5812.59 --> 5818.26
that's not how reality works because in

5815.78 --> 5822.17
reality you would have a thin layer of

5818.26 --> 5824.119000000001
warmed air just above a surface it would

5822.17 --> 5826.579
be if it's one inch close to you it's

5824.119 --> 5828.139
still gonna be one inch far away from

5826.579 --> 5830.239
you it's not gonna wrap up five degrees

5828.139 --> 5832.82
okay well that's good you know hey if

5830.239 --> 5835.4
you have a problem with this set up why

5832.82 --> 5837.469
don't you build your own setup that

5835.4 --> 5839.598999999999
could do it better more according to how

5837.469 --> 5841.61
you see the world working and let's see

5839.599 --> 5845.57
how well that matches up to actual

5841.61 --> 5847.46
observations okay Brenda well it doesn't

5845.57 --> 5849.349
you know if you're gonna match up with

5847.46 --> 5851.749
reality you have to represent reality

5849.349 --> 5854.6900000000005
and you have to account for everything

5851.749 --> 5856.94
so there is no no you don't reality

5854.69 --> 5859.07
there's no you know the five no you

5856.94 --> 5860.839999999999
don't when you have an emulation you

5859.07 --> 5863.268999999999
don't take account for everything in

5860.84 --> 5865.749
reality because if you scale down then

5863.269 --> 5868.610000000001
everything there's so many complications

5865.749 --> 5871.34
that's never done it's just not true

5868.61 --> 5875.539
it's an emulation for a very specific

5871.34 --> 5877.4890000000005
effect that's yes it doesn't have to

5875.539 --> 5879.92
take into account the entirety of

5877.489 --> 5882.65
reality you know then you would have to

5879.92 --> 5884.9890000000005
do it in a gas pressure chamber and all

5882.65 --> 5888.079
that it would be a crazy setup no it's

5884.989 --> 5891.079
just an emulation to simulate this

5888.079 --> 5894.079
visual effect and see if it matches

5891.079 --> 5896.03
reality and that's doing what you don't

5894.079 --> 5898.759999999999
just doing it backwards though you're

5896.03 --> 5900.38
making but for one thing you don't have

5898.76 --> 5902.869000000001
you're correct that you don't have to

5900.38 --> 5904.249
have every elements in it in a in a

5902.869 --> 5905.989
demonstration you don't have to have

5904.249 --> 5909.499
every element but the elements that you

5905.989 --> 5912.32
do have have to represent reality and

5909.499 --> 5914.329
the five degree ramp that you have

5912.32 --> 5916.67
doesn't right you're not listening

5914.329 --> 5919.549999999999
Brenda I'm getting sick of this you're

5916.67 --> 5922.61
not listening Arwen are when you're not

5919.55 --> 5924.17
listening we just told you I just told

5922.61 --> 5926.42
you it doesn't have

5924.17 --> 5928.4
to be physically matching reality

5926.42 --> 5930.9800000000005
because then you would also have to

5928.4 --> 5933.53
input the gas pressure all that and

5930.98 --> 5936.349999999999
maybe if you did all that you would have

5933.53 --> 5939.05
it naturally manifest in the miniature

5936.35 --> 5941.93
in a very complex difficult setup to

5939.05 --> 5943.64
emulate the entire reality emulation in

5941.93 --> 5947.06
miniature setting it's ridiculous and

5943.64 --> 5950.93
ever so we just import the guy from the

5947.06 --> 5952.97
video improvised and used the ramp

5950.93 --> 5956.0
effect instead and guess what

5952.97 --> 5958.79
it matches the observation that's what

5956.0 --> 5959.63
it's all about so why would you even

5958.79 --> 5962.72
care

5959.63 --> 5965.09
it matches the observation you're you

5962.72 --> 5968.63
are correct that you don't have to

5965.09 --> 5972.17
emulate every single part of reality but

5968.63 --> 5975.05
the parts that are that you do represent

5972.17 --> 5979.6900000000005
have to correspond to something in

5975.05 --> 5983.360000000001
reality and it yes it looks just like

5979.69 --> 5985.7
that's backwards now look Brenda if we

5983.36 --> 5988.099999999999
go by that demand that you're setting

5985.7 --> 5990.71
there then you can never do this

5988.1 --> 5993.35
experiment without a pressure chamber

5990.71 --> 5998.15
because of the miniaturization you have

5993.35 --> 6001.42
to put yeah put a similar refraction

5998.15 --> 6003.46
effect on the very air itself to scale

6001.42 --> 6008.13
it all down otherwise it's never gonna

6003.46 --> 6011.2
be correct so you are making this claim

6008.13 --> 6014.11
basically rendering it impossible to do

6011.2 --> 6016.87
any kind of emulation I agree with you I

6014.11 --> 6020.23
agree with you that you don't have to

6016.87 --> 6022.33
represent all of reality but the parts

6020.23 --> 6027.36
that you do have in your demonstration

6022.33 --> 6033.54
must correspond with reality I

6027.36 --> 6033.54
Fock sake just not

6037.02 --> 6060.4800000000005
oh right okay Randy is still in

6052.59 --> 6062.85
discussion whatever uh yeah like yeah

6060.48 --> 6064.11
when Brenda says the same [ __ ] over and

6062.85 --> 6066.0
over and over again

6064.11 --> 6068.13
like three or four times I get kind of

6066.0 --> 6070.68
sick of it I'm not gonna spend another

6068.13 --> 6073.05
half-hour repeating that same [ __ ] over

6070.68 --> 6079.62
and over again despite it being a pretty

6073.05 --> 6083.34
good conversation uh it's just the way

6079.62 --> 6087.78
it's gonna be unfortunately the god

6083.34 --> 6092.7
they're still in discussion maybe maybe

6087.78 --> 6094.5599999999995
Randy is gonna record it and have a

6092.7 --> 6096.57
separate video put on his channel

6094.56 --> 6098.55
I wouldn't mind if he did I don't mind

6096.57 --> 6104.63
anyway I am gonna round out the show

6098.55 --> 6113.0
I've been going 40 minutes getting

6104.63 --> 6113.0
groped okay you're yeah no no Randy

6123.62 --> 6129.53
hello hello welcome I'm not sure who

6127.37 --> 6131.66
tried to somebody tried to call me end

6129.53 --> 6136.04
up kicking people out you want to add

6131.66 --> 6140.42
Brenda again no no I left because I yeah

6136.04 --> 6142.34
I left I was done with her yet still

6140.42 --> 6143.89
life I wasn't gonna round out but hey

6142.34 --> 6146.96
you're back

6143.89 --> 6148.67
let's let's keep it going well

6146.96 --> 6150.9800000000005
ultimately it was about it was about

6148.67 --> 6152.39
this image here this water vapor so it

6150.98 --> 6154.25
was just conceded with Brenda that you

6152.39 --> 6156.14
can't see very far when it's raining

6154.25 --> 6157.64
heavily yeah mm-hmm look she on the look

6156.14 --> 6159.47
through rain was obviously a point where

6157.64 --> 6160.610000000001
you can't look through any further so

6159.47 --> 6162.650000000001
what that will come is it you'll be just

6160.61 --> 6166.58
be a physical blockage of water so it

6162.65 --> 6168.29
will become water blockage right so I'm

6166.58 --> 6170.09
looking over evaporation we've got

6168.29 --> 6175.7
liquid water and we've got water vapor

6170.09 --> 6177.14
so the h2o essentially yeah I hate to

6175.7 --> 6180.139999999999
out what they're in two different forms

6177.14 --> 6182.51
ones are liquid and ones vapor and this

6180.14 --> 6184.43
is indicative exactly what you'd see

6182.51 --> 6185.900000000001
with it when it's raining except that it

6184.43 --> 6188.990000000001
happened all most of it happened was

6185.9 --> 6190.7
very close to the to the water and half

6188.99 --> 6192.62
of it all if not most of it falls back

6190.7 --> 6194.69
down again and some of the water vapor

6192.62 --> 6196.82
escapes and forms the clouds but the

6194.69 --> 6199.4
most of this churning and stuff happens

6196.82 --> 6201.349999999999
right at the water's edge right right

6199.4 --> 6203.21
above the water you know the first few

6201.35 --> 6205.04
inches and that's what we're talking

6203.21 --> 6207.28
about that's what we're trying to

6205.04 --> 6211.58
describe is that this evaporation

6207.28 --> 6214.37
becomes the new solid so to speak

6211.58 --> 6218.42
optically it's not the solid in reality

6214.37 --> 6222.38
but it's a solid in in optics you know I

6218.42 --> 6224.6
had it will influence visuals basic as

6222.38 --> 6226.4800000000005
that even though it is kind of in a

6224.6 --> 6229.1
gaseous state it'll still have a

6226.48 --> 6233.03
significant effect on how lights

6229.1 --> 6235.55
transfers through it yeah exactly and

6233.03 --> 6237.83
and reflects off it obviously you know I

6235.55 --> 6239.54
mean I mean I would imagine that Brenda

6237.83 --> 6241.79
would have some way of obfuscate in that

6239.54 --> 6243.23
point again but it's very obvious to the

6241.79 --> 6245.42
to the people are watching right now

6243.23 --> 6247.58
that this is exactly what happens you

6245.42 --> 6249.2300000000005
can't see forever on there on any kind

6247.58 --> 6251.72
of surface especially when you've got

6249.23 --> 6253.37
water vapor in the air so you know the

6251.72 --> 6253.820000000001
point where you can't see through it

6253.37 --> 6256.28
anymore

6253.82 --> 6257.21
eventually the you just see a gray soup

6256.28 --> 6260.15
and

6257.21 --> 6265.58
missed yeah and the majority of that

6260.15 --> 6268.639999999999
happens right above the water so yeah

6265.58 --> 6270.41
there we go basically and it was a great

6268.64 --> 6274.1900000000005
presentation by no fanfare as well I

6270.41 --> 6276.59
have to say he did a great tester that

6274.19 --> 6278.2699999999995
simulates very closely what we see and

6276.59 --> 6279.7390000000005
the stuff that we've been talking about

6278.27 --> 6281.719
with its mirrored water layer in the

6279.739 --> 6283.82
evaporation and the churning that goes

6281.719 --> 6286.969
on it just above the water all that kind

6283.82 --> 6289.88
of atmospheric stuff that goes on and it

6286.969 --> 6292.88
quite clearly represented that you know

6289.88 --> 6294.32
the mirror was just a example of the

6292.88 --> 6298.79
stuff that's going on just above the

6294.32 --> 6300.62
water and yeah kudos kudos and he's all

6298.79 --> 6302.06
about that that angle of attack as well

6300.62 --> 6303.95
with Nathan you know the angle of attack

6302.06 --> 6306.59
still an angle you know it's an angle

6303.95 --> 6310.91
regardless right but it was a stunning

6306.59 --> 6314.75
match like you it's stunning and I it's

6310.91 --> 6318.11
just like yeah that looks really a lot

6314.75 --> 6320.66
like it so much and if you had a really

6318.11 --> 6322.96
good boat miniature and you did this

6320.66 --> 6325.969
thing and you wouldn't tell somebody

6322.96 --> 6330.14
they probably had trouble spotting in

6325.969 --> 6331.94
was a miniature it's that good that's

6330.14 --> 6333.8
telling when the mind starts to have

6331.94 --> 6336.3099999999995
trouble distinguish it from the real

6333.8 --> 6341.570000000001
thing that's when you know it's really

6336.31 --> 6343.79
really alike so great find great good

6341.57 --> 6347.299999999999
stuff no worries no worries

6343.79 --> 6349.1
right he grabbed it then yeah I will hey

6347.3 --> 6351.92
thanks Randy for popping by that wasn't

6349.1 --> 6353.51
really good no worries nice little back

6351.92 --> 6357.71
and forth with Brenda until got

6353.51 --> 6359.570000000001
repetitive was good I'll catch you in a

6357.71 --> 6360.92
bit then all right see you later

6359.57 --> 6362.69
everyone as well in the trial and by the

6360.92 --> 6364.1900000000005
way sleeping warriors coming on at 10

6362.69 --> 6367.089999999999
p.m. tonight on my channel

6364.19 --> 6369.95
so Randy father's the round table show

6367.09 --> 6373.79
is it gonna be about relative density

6369.95 --> 6375.17
about gravity ah okay look or went to it

6373.79 --> 6376.55
that should be an interesting

6375.17 --> 6378.68
presentation and let's see what he

6376.55 --> 6382.39
brings to the table right pretty bit

6378.68 --> 6385.6900000000005
guys all right thanks for coming Randy

6382.39 --> 6392.13
yeah that was good

6385.69 --> 6392.129999999999
ah Wow yeah that was pretty good show

6395.1 --> 6400.39
good show good weather good day I hope

6397.96 --> 6405.06
everybody's having a as good a day as I

6400.39 --> 6408.52
am because I just feel great good stuff

6405.06 --> 6411.31
things look forward to and yet again I

6408.52 --> 6414.370000000001
love these miniature simulation

6411.31 --> 6417.219
experiments that is just the best that

6414.37 --> 6421.86
is the best thing and I'll bet you that

6417.219 --> 6425.26
all the people at NASA and trickery

6421.86 --> 6427.87
stages and like Steven Spielberg and all

6425.26 --> 6430.21
those people they know everything about

6427.87 --> 6432.67
this stuff they know how to build those

6430.21 --> 6434.949
miniatures because it's their their

6432.67 --> 6438.46
profession to make it look so real that

6434.949 --> 6440.71
you can distinguish it so it's it's just

6438.46 --> 6443.62
very interesting to get through this

6440.71 --> 6445.96
kind of setup and experiment and then

6443.62 --> 6447.88
just see that it really matches because

6445.96 --> 6449.62
sometimes people try these things even

6447.88 --> 6453.01
like it's getting presented on the baits

6449.62 --> 6455.41
and it's like yeah it's kind of like it

6453.01 --> 6459.969
you're like yeah close but with this one

6455.41 --> 6461.86
it was like wow that is like uncanny so

6459.969 --> 6465.34
it's very interesting to bump in that

6461.86 --> 6467.11
kind of thing when it really matches so

6465.34 --> 6469.09
thanks again Randy for coming on and

6467.11 --> 6470.98
presenting that and being part of the

6469.09 --> 6472.96
little debate with Brenda was kind of

6470.98 --> 6475.449
amusing I don't like to go at it with

6472.96 --> 6477.85
her alone but with like God someone like

6475.449 --> 6483.28
you at my side so is fun to do it for a

6477.85 --> 6485.9490000000005
bit so rounding out the show thanks

6483.28 --> 6487.57
everyone for coming if you liked the

6485.949 --> 6490.69
video please don't forget to upload it

6487.57 --> 6492.989
and see the trolls got their first yeah

6490.69 --> 6495.549999999999
please don't forget it

6492.989 --> 6497.468999999999
also because if you do then it's like

6495.55 --> 6499.96
set in your youtube channel that helps

6497.469 --> 6503.26
then other people can see that you watch

6499.96 --> 6505.3
that show and that might lead them to me

6503.26 --> 6507.18
also so it does a definitely help if you

6505.3 --> 6509.77
upload it so please don't forget to and

6507.18 --> 6511.42
if you haven't already subscribe to my

6509.77 --> 6512.68
channel and hit the bell notification so

6511.42 --> 6514.87
you know when I'm going live which is

6512.68 --> 6517.929
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

6514.87 --> 6519.19
day and usually go for an hour but these

6517.929 --> 6522.9400000000005
days I tend to go

6519.19 --> 6527.699
longer I'm gonna join the Flat Earth

6522.94 --> 6532.0599999999995
debates I think I don't know if I can I

6527.699 --> 6534.07
know I wait yeah Nathan did throughout

6532.06 --> 6538.3
hangout link okay I guess I'll join

6534.07 --> 6539.59
whatever's left and I will be back

6538.3 --> 6541.150000000001
tomorrow with Flat Earth

6539.59 --> 6548.9490000000005
early-bird number two hundred and

6541.15 --> 6551.739
fifty-three fifty-three and yeah thanks

6548.949 --> 6554.73
again everyone for coming and doing this

6551.739 --> 6556.989
great show with me until the next time

6554.73 --> 6560.759999999999
keep it flat

6556.989 --> 6560.759999999999
oh yeah and hashtag MIFA
