very much needed

84.88 --> 89.52
right

86.96 --> 92.96
i'm gonna spend too much time on it but

89.52 --> 95.52
i literally have five euros

92.96 --> 95.52
that's it

96.079 --> 99.759
that's it right now

99.759 --> 102.96
getting in

100.88 --> 104.64
hope it's gonna be tuesday but that's

102.96 --> 106.72
literally

104.64 --> 110.88
it's gonna get complicated

106.72 --> 114.399
so i can really seriously use a

110.88 --> 118.24
big donation if all possible

114.399 --> 120.159
feels kind of weird to ask

118.24 --> 122.479
but yeah i think you guys are kind of

120.159 --> 125.04
used to it by now from me and at least i

122.479 --> 126.0
am consistent within the times of the

125.04 --> 129.20000000000002
month

126.0 --> 131.52
at it right anyway

129.2 --> 131.51999999999998
right

131.84 --> 134.48
it is

133.44 --> 139.92
sunday

134.48 --> 141.67999999999998
the 12th of september 2021

139.92 --> 146.07999999999998
weather is

141.68 --> 146.08
very similar to yesterday it's cloudy

147.76 --> 153.92
it's cool off a little it's still kind

150.8 --> 153.92000000000002
of nice but

154.4 --> 158.64000000000001
it's slowly cooling off with all this

156.72 --> 161.35999999999999
clouded weather

158.64 --> 164.95899999999997
also it's been raining yesterday too

161.36 --> 167.36
like but not very long

164.959 --> 170.4
when i went out for groceries i had to

167.36 --> 173.12
go through the rain a bit but yeah it's

170.4 --> 174.64000000000001
not that terrible

173.12 --> 177.519
right a little bit of water is not going

174.64 --> 177.51899999999998
to hurt anybody

183.28 --> 187.519
as long as it's just a little bit

188.319 --> 191.319
right

198.239 --> 202.56
okay nobody in chat just yet

202.959 --> 207.599
all right i was watching my show back

204.72 --> 207.599
from yesterday

207.84 --> 212.56
and i got mixed feelings about it one

210.879 --> 214.959
hand it was really good

212.56 --> 216.72
on the other hand oh my god

214.959 --> 218.48
i totally called it

216.72 --> 221.12
when i said it at the start of the show

218.48 --> 223.76
i was kind of low energy

221.12 --> 226.159
so it was kind of a bit like even the

223.76 --> 230.0
when i was pretty enthusiastic i really

226.159 --> 230.0
like had to push the energy out

231.519 --> 235.36
so that was kind of a bit of a

233.2 --> 238.959
disappointment but

235.36 --> 241.84
as to what i was communicating

238.959 --> 241.84
that was good

242.159 --> 245.439
i really

243.68 --> 247.76000000000002
dug up some

245.439 --> 250.56
deeper philosophy

247.76 --> 255.07999999999998
reflections of myself

250.56 --> 255.08
onto afterlife and all that

256.72 --> 262.88000000000005
so yeah i hope to get more feedback i

258.88 --> 262.88
really hope to kind of trigger people's

263.68 --> 269.199
imagination

266.32 --> 271.759
but in all seriousness it's not like a

269.199 --> 271.759
joke to me

273.199 --> 279.44
and yeah get more responses about this

276.24 --> 280.96000000000004
get get a discussion going

279.44 --> 284.639
seems very tough

280.96 --> 286.32
anyway hello moon shadow first in chat

284.639 --> 288.32
good to see you

286.32 --> 290.639
so as you can probably hear by my voice

288.32 --> 292.8
i am more energetic now

290.639 --> 294.96000000000004
because i did manage to go to bed not

292.8 --> 297.6
too late finally

294.96 --> 299.68
was still pretty late but not like five

297.6 --> 303.36
o'clock which when i go about five

299.68 --> 303.36
o'clock it's usually not good

304.479 --> 310.919
at a very

306.0 --> 310.919
intense day overall yesterday

311.52 --> 314.32
even though i was basically alone at

313.36 --> 316.47900000000004
home

314.32 --> 320.56
and i'm still alone at home

316.479 --> 320.56
so i can be loud in whatever i like

320.639 --> 325.039
but yeah ball buster's life

323.52 --> 327.59999999999997
and i was there

325.039 --> 329.36
wasn't super active it was mostly just

327.6 --> 332.16
going to get through the scientific

329.36 --> 332.16
method again and

332.32 --> 336.56
that was good but

334.16 --> 340.47900000000004
here's the funny part

336.56 --> 341.6
after the show was over recording

340.479 --> 344.08
we kind of

341.6 --> 347.36
hung around

344.08 --> 349.75899999999996
for three hours

347.36 --> 351.199
like really long

349.759 --> 354.32
till

351.199 --> 354.32
what for me was

356.24 --> 360.08
like

357.28 --> 361.919
until two o'clock or something at night

360.08 --> 363.44
and it was

361.919 --> 365.35999999999996
interesting

363.44 --> 367.84
is that herbal tea no it's just green

365.36 --> 370.639
tea it's always just green tea

367.84 --> 373.44
i drink green tea always just green tea

370.639 --> 376.08
i've been drinking just green tea and

373.44 --> 380.16
sometimes tomara coffee

376.08 --> 382.0
since the very first shows

380.16 --> 384.96000000000004
since even before the flat earth early

382.0 --> 388.16
beard it's just green d

384.96 --> 389.84
i never drink anything else

388.16 --> 392.24
that is just

389.84 --> 393.75899999999996
the anything other than just green tea

392.24 --> 395.759
okay

393.759 --> 397.6
unless it doesn't just look like green

395.759 --> 400.08000000000004
tea

397.6 --> 402.96000000000004
anyway hello stop traffic in my rasta

400.08 --> 405.039
hat steamy traveler

402.96 --> 406.79999999999995
right but anyway

405.039 --> 408.4
hung around

406.8 --> 410.96000000000004
in the discord

408.4 --> 413.84
with kiwi and adam

410.96 --> 413.84
kiwi was like

414.639 --> 419.84000000000003
well he basically

417.199 --> 422.08000000000004
got kind of riled up because he didn't

419.84 --> 424.23999999999995
have proper lunch then you could

422.08 --> 425.199
literally hear him eating lunch at some

424.24 --> 427.28000000000003
point

425.199 --> 429.039
and then like 10 minutes after that he

427.28 --> 431.28
suddenly all calmed down

429.039 --> 434.28
so that was very telling

431.28 --> 434.28
but

439.919 --> 442.88
that's just great

443.36 --> 449.36
uh

445.199 --> 452.0
bob the science guy got in

449.36 --> 454.24
and yeah bit of a spoiler alert

452.0 --> 456.24
because i think that kiwi is gonna

454.24 --> 457.759
definitely roll out an empty clip of

456.24 --> 458.88
this

457.759 --> 460.56
soon

458.88 --> 463.28
but yeah

460.56 --> 466.0
bob the science guy

463.28 --> 468.87899999999996
thinks and double down on

466.0 --> 468.879
what he said

469.599 --> 474.4
and that is basically

471.36 --> 477.40000000000003
the second sextant doesn't use

474.4 --> 477.4
trigonometry

479.84 --> 484.15999999999997
yeah

481.039 --> 485.84
so that's going to be special

484.16 --> 488.639
when you think that they can't get more

485.84 --> 490.15999999999997
ridiculous they prove you wrong

488.639 --> 493.68
right so

490.16 --> 495.28000000000003
that's going to be the new

493.68 --> 496.479
[ __ ]

495.28 --> 499.75899999999996
right

496.479 --> 502.15999999999997
yeah i know right rasta hat

499.759 --> 504.16
it's like ugh

502.16 --> 506.72
i i don't even wanna explain it because

504.16 --> 510.59900000000005
it's so basic you should be laughing

506.72 --> 510.59900000000005
after i've said that

520.24 --> 525.2
almost like saying like oh yeah

522.719 --> 526.48
you're not supposed to roll

525.2 --> 530.24
the wheel

526.48 --> 532.5600000000001
the wheel wasn't designed for rolling

530.24 --> 534.48
that's basically the level of statement

532.56 --> 536.399
that falls under

534.48 --> 537.76
it's so silly

536.399 --> 540.32
anyway

537.76 --> 543.04
right and after that we had kind of more

540.32 --> 545.6800000000001
more of a psychological session because

543.04 --> 550.959
bev got in there

545.68 --> 552.8
and beth has some really odd behaviors

550.959 --> 556.88
odd convictions

552.8 --> 556.88
and what i came to name

557.12 --> 563.839
he is a

559.88 --> 563.8389999999999
terrestrial agnostic

564.64 --> 570.16
that's really what it is like he refuses

568.56 --> 573.76
to call it flat

570.16 --> 576.16
he refuses to describe

573.76 --> 580.16
any kind of geometry

576.16 --> 583.519
or shape or anything substantial

580.16 --> 585.12
about it and like he neurotically avoids

583.519 --> 588.64
that like

585.12 --> 591.12
almost anti-flat earther level evasion

588.64 --> 592.959
of questions scattergunning with new

591.12 --> 595.6
detail questions

592.959 --> 595.5999999999999
answering

596.24 --> 601.76
but with not answers

599.36 --> 604.8000000000001
with yeah that's what he was doing

601.76 --> 606.88
constantly because he just refused to

604.8 --> 609.3599999999999
call the earth flat even though we made

606.88 --> 611.8389999999999
technical arguments me and adam

609.36 --> 613.36
as to like yeah but

611.839 --> 615.2
you're just

613.36 --> 618.32
a necessity

615.2 --> 620.5600000000001
unnecessarily trying to avoid calling it

618.32 --> 622.88
that when

620.56 --> 624.3199999999999
it's just a geometric aspect but he just

622.88 --> 627.519
refused

624.32 --> 630.6400000000001
so that happened as well after the

627.519 --> 630.64
bob the science guy

630.959 --> 635.4399999999999
stated that

632.56 --> 636.399
sexton's don't use trigonometry

635.44 --> 638.8800000000001
uh

636.399 --> 641.44
it was yeah it was pretty intense

638.88 --> 643.279
for that late but it was fun

641.44 --> 646.2790000000001
and interesting

643.279 --> 646.279
right

648.88 --> 654.16
oh god yeah you get out of here

651.839 --> 658.2790000000001
it's a disgusting slander

654.16 --> 658.279
all right hello george sanford

664.72 --> 671.36
why are you addressing that

667.2 --> 671.36
it's just a disgusting slanderer

673.519 --> 677.2
right hello eagle plane and anchor james

675.92 --> 680.76
mason

677.2 --> 680.76
good to see you

697.12 --> 700.12
uh

703.04 --> 707.8389999999999
yeah yeah it's it's your context it's

705.36 --> 709.279
the context that you are trying to carry

707.839 --> 711.6800000000001
through

709.279 --> 714.16
you're trying to show it like it's an

711.68 --> 717.279
attack right i know what you do this is

714.16 --> 721.4399999999999

725.04 --> 728.8
disgusting demonic people

728.0 --> 731.36
do

728.8 --> 733.76
and i recognize it instantly

731.36 --> 735.839
so you don't have to try to semantically

733.76 --> 736.959
justify what you're saying

879.44 --> 885.12
sarcasm because he can be an absolute

882.079 --> 887.5999999999999

that's fine

920.32 --> 924.279
i don't know about it

933.279 --> 938.4399999999999
talking to him in the skype chat right

935.44 --> 938.44
now

940.13 --> 947.99
[Applause]

950.98 --> 956.539
[Applause]

957.79 --> 960.9699999999999
[Music]

971.279 --> 976.8
yeah i am asking him

974.0 --> 980.44
self vendel comptie you don't have to

976.8 --> 980.4399999999999
tell me yeah

982.0 --> 986.0
asking him right now in chat

986.24 --> 991.759
dude i'll freaking call him up on the

988.48 --> 991.759
show if necessary

994.88 --> 998.8
yeah i know moonshadow he's a complete

997.6 --> 1001.1990000000001
ogre

998.8 --> 1003.519
it's really annoying at times because

1001.199 --> 1007.12
all the freaking

1003.519 --> 1010.079
wannabe cnn news anchor piece of [ __ ]

1007.12 --> 1012.5600000000001
troll scumbags out there are immediately

1010.079 --> 1015.04
gonna make a new new story out of

1012.56 --> 1016.7199999999999
something stupid he said yeah

1015.04 --> 1019.04
and then i have to deal with it because

1016.72 --> 1021.36
they're gonna be whining in my chat and

1019.04 --> 1023.68
everywhere constantly

1021.36 --> 1027.88
so thanks sleeping warrior thanks for

1023.68 --> 1027.8799999999999
your tactical genius

1050.799 --> 1053.799
uh

1060.85 --> 1064.9599999999998
[Music]

1063.12 --> 1067.84
all right just trying to get his

1064.96 --> 1067.8400000000001
attention

1080.08 --> 1083.08
uh

1104.4 --> 1107.3600000000001
dude

1106.559 --> 1109.6789999999999
like

1107.36 --> 1112.799
i think i know what this just he just

1109.679 --> 1115.039
tried out something and he just

1112.799 --> 1117.12
just does that right

1115.039 --> 1120.559
because any

1117.12 --> 1122.4799999999998
non-flat earth related person could just

1120.559 --> 1124.72
do that and as long as they didn't do

1122.48 --> 1127.84
anything disgusting sexual

1124.72 --> 1130.64
nobody would have a problem with it

1127.84 --> 1134.32
yeah but of course because he's a flat

1130.64 --> 1135.76
earther oh my god there's a bladder

1134.32 --> 1138.48
yeah yeah yeah that's going to be

1135.76 --> 1140.16
squirting a lot of anti-flat earther

1138.48 --> 1142.96
troll [ __ ] are going to be

1140.16 --> 1142.96
squirting now

1154.16 --> 1159.3200000000002
anyway hopefully he's gonna show up in

1156.08 --> 1159.32
my chat

1181.919 --> 1186.1200000000001
right so i've got anything else

1192.64 --> 1199.1200000000001
oh well i'm okay then ares the cursive

1195.919 --> 1202.3200000000002
man that's really cool

1199.12 --> 1204.9599999999998
that you're gonna stick up for what you

1202.32 --> 1207.84
think he's doing is wrong

1204.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
that's really nice

1241.28 --> 1245.6789999999999
yeah sure it was harmless probably

1246.4 --> 1249.44
because

1247.2 --> 1252.8400000000001
dude he doesn't do

1249.44 --> 1252.8400000000001
bad things

1261.25 --> 1266.159
[Music]

1263.2 --> 1270.0
yeah you know what is also weird

1266.159 --> 1272.96
people in chats constantly whining about

1270.0 --> 1276.159
somebody else doing something when it's

1272.96 --> 1280.24
obviously taking out a context

1276.159 --> 1280.24
because you know this guy you know

1280.48 --> 1287.679
he's not like you're suggesting through

1284.0 --> 1290.64
all that what everybody's gonna be

1287.679 --> 1293.52
over yeah you know he's not doing that

1290.64 --> 1296.24
you know that so you're just a whiny

1293.52 --> 1300.4
chat person

1296.24 --> 1302.4
that is being a complainy pants

1300.4 --> 1305.8400000000001
for no good reason just to be a

1302.4 --> 1305.8400000000001
complainy pants

1312.799 --> 1317.039
online physics classes

1315.52 --> 1320.48
have you thought about

1317.039 --> 1322.72
online uh

1320.48 --> 1325.6
sure

1322.72 --> 1327.919
i mean i practically do online physics

1325.6 --> 1330.84
classes it's part of what i do it's just

1327.919 --> 1333.44
that yeah i'm not just

1330.84 --> 1334.799
gonna just do that

1333.44 --> 1336.559
right

1334.799 --> 1338.799
it all depends if somebody's going to

1336.559 --> 1340.559
get in here and then going to ask me

1338.799 --> 1342.32
about that

1340.559 --> 1345.6789999999999
then

1342.32 --> 1348.1589999999999
i will give you physics classes

1345.679 --> 1348.159
that's it

1348.72 --> 1350.96
what

1353.36 --> 1356.84
a fifth time

1375.76 --> 1379.44
all right you're talking about aries

1379.76 --> 1384.2
the complainy pants of men

1390.24 --> 1393.24
right

1431.919 --> 1436.0800000000002
do you think a knowledge of physics is

1433.84 --> 1439.279
necessary to believe in flat earth well

1436.08 --> 1439.279
that's a trick question

1442.64 --> 1448.0800000000002
but yeah a knowledge of physics

1446.32 --> 1451.36
kind of leads to

1448.08 --> 1454.1589999999999
figuring out the earth is flat

1451.36 --> 1458.12
so if you had if you had phrased it like

1454.159 --> 1458.1200000000001
that then yes

1459.84 --> 1464.24
because

1460.799 --> 1467.36
once you figure out physics

1464.24 --> 1470.08
you realize that the globe earth model

1467.36 --> 1471.279
conceptions and the popular stories

1470.08 --> 1475.08
about that

1471.279 --> 1475.08
is completely impossible

1487.44 --> 1495.1200000000001
a knowledge of mainstream physics what

1492.159 --> 1495.1200000000001
what does that mean

1495.84 --> 1500.72
is it as knowledge of physics or

1498.559 --> 1503.12
non-physics are you talking about

1500.72 --> 1506.08
pseudoscience physics

1503.12 --> 1506.08
globe physics

1509.76 --> 1514.72
whatever happened to seeking star wars i

1511.6 --> 1516.1589999999999
don't know

1514.72 --> 1517.52
i think i might have robbed her the

1516.159 --> 1518.5590000000002
wrong way

1517.52 --> 1520.4
and

1518.559 --> 1522.32
she just moved on or something i don't

1520.4 --> 1524.72
know what it what it is

1522.32 --> 1526.6399999999999
we did we did kind of she did kind of

1524.72 --> 1528.96
clash

1526.64 --> 1530.88
here and there when i

1528.96 --> 1533.44
made certain statements

1530.88 --> 1533.44
i don't know

1535.2 --> 1539.2
i mean she's not banned or anything

1536.88 --> 1541.6000000000001
she's still welcome but yeah people come

1539.2 --> 1545.279
and go

1541.6 --> 1545.279
that's that's what happens here

1551.52 --> 1554.72
it's okay stop the traffic and arrest

1553.44 --> 1557.72
that

1554.72 --> 1557.72
okay

1566.559 --> 1571.36
yeah hey aries cursive man yeah james

1568.799 --> 1573.279
mason is not a troll

1571.36 --> 1576.4799999999998
yeah you're the troll

1573.279 --> 1579.679
okay james mason is somebody i've known

1576.48 --> 1582.559
quite a while he's an actual supporter

1579.679 --> 1585.919
of my channel and nathan's channel

1582.559 --> 1588.0
and he's very defensive of people that

1585.919 --> 1590.0800000000002
he knows and cares about

1588.0 --> 1595.76
yeah so if you're constantly gonna

1590.08 --> 1598.08
slander somebody by suggesting indecency

1595.76 --> 1599.76
right when it's more like just

1598.08 --> 1602.0
clumsiness

1599.76 --> 1605.6
if you're gonna constantly repeat

1602.0 --> 1607.76
certain statements suggesting indecency

1605.6 --> 1610.48
yeah he's gonna get pissed off i get

1607.76 --> 1614.559
pissed off because i know

1610.48 --> 1614.559
sleeping warrior is not like that

1615.2 --> 1617.6000000000001
all right

1618.96 --> 1623.159
yeah let's get out of here

1639.12 --> 1643.279
oh yeah that's a good way of saying at

1640.64 --> 1646.5200000000002
the classical homeopath welcome to chat

1643.279 --> 1646.52
by the way

1657.919 --> 1663.039
oh you said it poor judgment and well

1660.88 --> 1664.96
yeah yeah okay yeah so yeah he has poor

1663.039 --> 1667.2
judgment and is a little weird sometimes

1664.96 --> 1668.64
yeah

1667.2 --> 1671.919
hey

1668.64 --> 1671.919
i make mistakes too

1672.24 --> 1674.48
right

1675.12 --> 1682.399
so is that real is that really worth

1678.24 --> 1685.279
like writing a piece on it in my chat is

1682.399 --> 1685.279
that really worth it

1687.52 --> 1691.9189999999999
i mean why don't you start a blog about

1690.96 --> 1694.159
about

1691.919 --> 1696.3990000000001
sleeping warrior and how

1694.159 --> 1699.0390000000002
wrong that all is why did you just write

1696.399 --> 1702.039
a blog about him or something

1699.039 --> 1702.039
god

1739.44 --> 1745.2
my favorite physics and scientific

1742.559 --> 1745.2
experiments

1746.32 --> 1749.96
not really experiments

1753.6 --> 1757.6789999999999
but yeah things

1755.6 --> 1761.279
like there's just a lot of things in

1757.679 --> 1764.0
which you can see like how material and

1761.279 --> 1765.6
properties of material and all that work

1764.0 --> 1768.399
right that's just testing yeah there's

1765.6 --> 1770.6399999999999
so much so much you could do

1768.399 --> 1772.559
but i usually it it comes rolling out

1770.64 --> 1774.96
during flat earth debates

1772.559 --> 1776.799
most of it

1774.96 --> 1778.559
just like uh

1776.799 --> 1779.679
from friday's show which we should be

1778.559 --> 1782.399
hearing

1779.679 --> 1785.44
somewhere this afternoon in the premiere

1782.399 --> 1786.4799999999998
over nathaniel please

1785.44 --> 1788.48
about

1786.48 --> 1789.52
uh gas

1788.48 --> 1792.24
and

1789.52 --> 1794.24
like how gas in tanks

1792.24 --> 1796.64
could still be considered to have some

1794.24 --> 1799.1200000000001
weight and then basically

1796.64 --> 1802.0
like how that effectively isn't the case

1799.12 --> 1804.2399999999998
because it that's not how gas is even

1802.0 --> 1806.24
stored in tanks it becomes compressed

1804.24 --> 1807.6
and then it's a liquid so it has a mass

1806.24 --> 1810.72
again

1807.6 --> 1812.32
right that discussion it will come up

1810.72 --> 1813.6000000000001
on today's premiere

1812.32 --> 1815.84
pretty sure

1813.6 --> 1817.84
but in that i also said like okay yeah

1815.84 --> 1820.399
yeah where do the droplets form no they

1817.84 --> 1823.4399999999998
don't form at the bottom

1820.399 --> 1826.799
they form at the container wall because

1823.44 --> 1828.72
when they transit from gaseous to liquid

1826.799 --> 1830.08
state

1828.72 --> 1831.52
like

1830.08 --> 1836.08
it doesn't

1831.52 --> 1838.1589999999999
compact at the bottom because gases are

1836.08 --> 1841.84
not susceptible by momentum they don't

1838.159 --> 1844.96
have inertia they don't have mass

1841.84 --> 1847.52
so the droplets would then form

1844.96 --> 1850.88
all over the tank including the top and

1847.52 --> 1854.0
then once they are sufficiently liquid

1850.88 --> 1856.159
the mass would cause it to basically

1854.0 --> 1859.039
roll down the side

1856.159 --> 1859.0390000000002
like droplets

1861.039 --> 1865.84
they denied the phase change well they'd

1863.039 --> 1865.84
overlook it

1866.08 --> 1869.6
they overlook the phase change

1871.6 --> 1878.08
because if there's only gas in a tanker

1875.12 --> 1881.4399999999998
like there's not sufficient pressure on

1878.08 --> 1883.039
the tanker to make the gas in there into

1881.44 --> 1884.0
a liquid

1883.039 --> 1888.0
then

1884.0 --> 1890.72
that weight is going to be negligible

1888.0 --> 1893.36
because the gas inside the tank in its

1890.72 --> 1895.76
gaseous form is probably not really

1893.36 --> 1895.76
going to be

1896.32 --> 1901.36
all that much denser than the

1898.799 --> 1904.72
surrounding air

1901.36 --> 1907.519
so it will not show its atomic weight it

1904.72 --> 1909.679
might offset something versus if there

1907.519 --> 1911.76
was a pure vacuum in there

1909.679 --> 1914.0800000000002
but it's not going to be a proper weight

1911.76 --> 1915.2
it's not going to be a linear relation

1914.08 --> 1917.36
to

1915.2 --> 1918.96
things that weigh things normally like

1917.36 --> 1921.76
liquids and

1918.96 --> 1924.48
solid matter

1921.76 --> 1924.48
what is mass

1924.72 --> 1928.159
right

1926.0 --> 1932.84
well mass

1928.159 --> 1938.48
is a derived part of density

1932.84 --> 1938.48
that it basically describes the ability

1938.88 --> 1943.6000000000001
to be susceptible to momentum and as i

1941.919 --> 1947.44
originally call it and what's the other

1943.6 --> 1947.4399999999998
name again i keep forgetting

1947.6 --> 1953.12
inertia right it it basically is the

1951.519 --> 1955.44
ability

1953.12 --> 1957.36
to be affected by inertia

1955.44 --> 1959.679
to have that

1957.36 --> 1961.1999999999998
that's really what effectively defines

1959.679 --> 1964.64
it

1961.2 --> 1964.64
and gases don't have that

1970.48 --> 1974.84
right

1971.44 --> 1976.72
now what all matter does have in any

1974.84 --> 1979.6789999999999
circumstances

1976.72 --> 1983.279
in any circumstance is

1979.679 --> 1985.8400000000001
a density because gases do have density

1983.279 --> 1988.159
and the density is not a derived thing

1985.84 --> 1990.399
it's still going to have that density

1988.159 --> 1992.3990000000001
right the density is the density this is

1990.399 --> 1995.039
universal

1992.399 --> 1997.039
all matter has density all of it

1995.039 --> 1999.919
no exception

1997.039 --> 2003.12
but not all matter has mass

1999.919 --> 2005.3600000000001
a derived concept

2003.12 --> 2008.399
gas doesn't have mass because it doesn't

2005.36 --> 2008.399
have inertia so

2008.559 --> 2013.519
it's not gonna continue a pathway it's

2010.96 --> 2013.519
not gonna

2015.76 --> 2019.559
cause a weight

2025.44 --> 2029.44
what about the forces created by we

2027.44 --> 2031.44
never said that gases can't create

2029.44 --> 2034.3200000000002
forces

2031.44 --> 2038.0800000000002
right the air pressure differential is

2034.32 --> 2038.08
definitely going to exert a force

2041.519 --> 2048.56
but it's just going to be yeah a force

2045.44 --> 2049.839
to equalize the local gas pressure

2048.56 --> 2052.0
differential

2049.839 --> 2054.48
and then when it's equalized with its

2052.0 --> 2056.24
body with the rest of the gas it's going

2054.48 --> 2058.639
to be gone and

2056.24 --> 2061.2
it's not going to be a wave of gas

2058.639 --> 2062.7200000000003
that's going to keep on moving

2061.2 --> 2064.6389999999997
like an object

2062.72 --> 2066.56
or liquid

2064.639 --> 2071.0
so as soon as the pressure is equalized

2066.56 --> 2071.0
it just stops there's no more force

2074.48 --> 2078.96
what are the units of dense dude i don't

2077.76 --> 2082.5600000000004
know

2078.96 --> 2082.56
what are the units of a density

2084.56 --> 2089.839
god

2086.159 --> 2089.839
getting a little mathematical here

2092.56 --> 2097.359
right yeah gas is also unbonded that's

2095.119 --> 2097.359
right

2098.8 --> 2102.3590000000004
goes in all directions

2104.64 --> 2111.2
no mass without containment no it still

2107.119 --> 2111.2000000000003
doesn't have mass with containment

2113.76 --> 2118.88
right the mass

2115.44 --> 2120.7200000000003
will not be proportional

2118.88 --> 2123.04
right there might it might be

2120.72 --> 2125.4399999999996
there might be pressure

2123.04 --> 2128.0
weight registered

2125.44 --> 2130.2400000000002
but that number is not going to be

2128.0 --> 2132.32
proportional to the material to the

2130.24 --> 2134.24
gas's density

2132.32 --> 2137.44
that's what i say

2134.24 --> 2139.4399999999996
right so you can't say that's mass

2137.44 --> 2142.16
because it's just it's a pressure

2139.44 --> 2143.599
registry device that's what a scale is

2142.16 --> 2145.44
right and there might be some pressure

2143.599 --> 2147.28
but that pressure is not going to be

2145.44 --> 2149.76
proportional

2147.28 --> 2150.88
to the atomic mass the density of the

2149.76 --> 2153.92
gas

2150.88 --> 2156.2400000000002
because it is only an offset between the

2153.92 --> 2160.48
gas contained

2156.24 --> 2163.04
and the medium gas it is sitting in

2160.48 --> 2165.119
and that's not gonna yield to the

2163.04 --> 2169.119
typical

2165.119 --> 2169.119
proportional weight result

2169.52 --> 2172.92
to its density

2178.56 --> 2185.88
density is a measure of compactness what

2181.839 --> 2185.88
the compactness is a description

2207.2 --> 2211.48
no that's incorrect moon shadow

2216.16 --> 2220.56
i think

2218.32 --> 2220.56
wait

2224.16 --> 2227.04
it's mess

2227.599 --> 2234.4
is that does is it represented

2230.079 --> 2236.6400000000003
numerically in in grams and kilograms

2234.4 --> 2236.64
hmm

2236.8 --> 2242.76
right okay in that case it would be

2238.96 --> 2242.76
considered weight

2243.2 --> 2245.4399999999996
okay

2245.76 --> 2250.1600000000003
right but it's an extracted value so

2255.44 --> 2260.2400000000002
how can gas have density if it has no

2257.44 --> 2262.8
mass well because mass is not really a

2260.24 --> 2266.8799999999997
universal aspect it's not

2262.8 --> 2269.6800000000003
a natural thing that all matter has mass

2266.88 --> 2272.96
is a derivative it's derived

2269.68 --> 2273.839
from the relative density offset of

2272.96 --> 2275.04
it

2273.839 --> 2277.92
the gas

2275.04 --> 2281.2
and the medium it is in

2277.92 --> 2284.2000000000003
which is presumed to also be gas

2281.2 --> 2284.2
right

2303.28 --> 2308.2400000000002
pressurized oxygen but yeah but a

2305.119 --> 2311.2000000000003
pressurized oxygen bottle is not gas

2308.24 --> 2314.0
because pressurized gas

2311.2 --> 2316.96
is no longer gas it becomes a liquid and

2314.0 --> 2319.04
then it does gain mass

2316.96 --> 2321.76
and that mass will be proportional to

2319.04 --> 2325.68
its atomic weight

2321.76 --> 2327.8390000000004
unlike when it is in pure gaseous state

2325.68 --> 2327.839
right

2332.72 --> 2334.9599999999996
yeah

2333.599 --> 2338.2400000000002
we get it

2334.96 --> 2342.16
bigly and best we get it we know the

2338.24 --> 2347.04
formula yeah we know it yeah density is

2342.16 --> 2347.04
mass per unit volume we know we know

2348.16 --> 2352.24
but that doesn't mean that all things

2350.4 --> 2354.2400000000002
have mass it's just like oh you're

2352.24 --> 2356.3999999999996
trying to explain density well that is

2354.24 --> 2359.2799999999997
how you would typically explain it

2356.4 --> 2363.92
problem is that mass is still rooted in

2359.28 --> 2363.92
the assumption of gravity originally

2364.48 --> 2368.88
it yeah just becomes kind of complicated

2367.359 --> 2371.359
like that

2368.88 --> 2374.7200000000003
even though it seems so simple all you

2371.359 --> 2377.359
have to do is just assume gravity is a

2374.72 --> 2380.0789999999997
thing right and then it all works out

2377.359 --> 2382.24
according to the formulas yeah we know

2380.079 --> 2383.599
they did that on purpose the [ __ ] with

2382.24 --> 2386.9599999999996
your mind

2383.599 --> 2386.96
so you'll never get out

2387.76 --> 2390.0
right

2395.28 --> 2399.92
well you don't understand what relative

2397.28 --> 2401.6800000000003
density offset means

2399.92 --> 2405.6800000000003
it's the differential

2401.68 --> 2405.68
relative density differential

2405.76 --> 2412.5600000000004
the offset which would be okay

2409.68 --> 2414.72
how much more dense is this gas inside

2412.56 --> 2417.359
of the balloon or whatever versus the

2414.72 --> 2420.9599999999996
gas of the medium and then the offset

2417.359 --> 2420.96
the density differentials

2421.04 --> 2424.4
which is what that is right density

2423.2 --> 2426.319
offset

2424.4 --> 2429.119
is the differential

2426.319 --> 2430.0
between the gas of the medium and the

2429.119 --> 2431.44
gas

2430.0 --> 2434.88
that is being

2431.44 --> 2434.88
measured or yeah

2435.28 --> 2438.599
being weighed

2442.96 --> 2446.599
i hope that clarifies

2462.64 --> 2467.56
sl units or established okay

2471.68 --> 2477.7599999999998
the wind feels like no that's not mass

2475.359 --> 2479.44
oh that's pressure

2477.76 --> 2481.8390000000004
right

2479.44 --> 2484.8
you're not if you feel wind on your skin

2481.839 --> 2486.4
that's not a a mass that's literally the

2484.8 --> 2488.88
continual

2486.4 --> 2490.8
motion of gas moving past it

2488.88 --> 2495.079
pressurizing it that's what you then

2490.8 --> 2495.079
feel that's not mass

2504.079 --> 2507.6800000000003
right

2505.04 --> 2510.0
when you lie on the ground and there is

2507.68 --> 2511.5989999999997
you don't feel the air weighing on you

2510.0 --> 2514.88
now if you

2511.599 --> 2516.96
lie in the water like under water you

2514.88 --> 2520.079
will feel the weight of the water

2516.96 --> 2520.079
because it's a liquid

2521.28 --> 2528.6400000000003
and it does have mass and it will press

2524.0 --> 2528.64
onto you gas doesn't do that

2530.56 --> 2534.24
it only

2532.0 --> 2536.079
presses when there is a local air

2534.24 --> 2537.9199999999996
pressure differential and it just starts

2536.079 --> 2541.04
to move in a certain direction and then

2537.92 --> 2542.48
it's going to exert pressure

2541.04 --> 2546.0
doesn't just in

2542.48 --> 2546.0
a static state doesn't do that

2547.92 --> 2553.04
it just presses in all directions within

2550.0 --> 2557.319
the available container but that's not a

2553.04 --> 2557.319
weight type of pressure

2568.48 --> 2574.16
do molecules have mass

2571.92 --> 2574.16
no

2574.96 --> 2579.359
not always not when they're in a gaseous

2577.359 --> 2582.88
state

2579.359 --> 2585.7599999999998
right they might have an atomic mass

2582.88 --> 2588.1600000000003
pretty sure that's not based on gaseous

2585.76 --> 2588.1600000000003
states

2589.76 --> 2594.8
right there's no gas

2592.88 --> 2598.6400000000003
as far as i know that cannot be

2594.8 --> 2598.6400000000003
compacted into a liquid

2599.119 --> 2604.1600000000003
so they can always get the atomic mass

2601.68 --> 2604.16
that way

2604.72 --> 2608.9599999999996
but effectively it doesn't have mass

2606.72 --> 2611.1189999999997
while in gaseous state because that's

2608.96 --> 2614.2400000000002
just doesn't do that

2611.119 --> 2614.2400000000002
doesn't have inertia

2616.56 --> 2621.839
what pushes the mercury up in a mercury

2619.119 --> 2621.839
barometer

2625.839 --> 2630.7999999999997
i think it's the intermolecular bond

2628.48 --> 2633.8
pressure right because mercury it

2630.8 --> 2633.8
expands

2635.599 --> 2641.76
if i'm not mistaken it expands within

2637.92 --> 2641.76
the very limited container and then

2642.16 --> 2648.52
pushes upwards into the vacuum

2645.04 --> 2648.52
part of the tube

2648.64 --> 2654.56
but real small yeah that's really cute

2652.0 --> 2657.359
but yeah that gas with the mass is

2654.56 --> 2659.839
really small it's also not proportional

2657.359 --> 2663.839
when you actually weigh it yeah it's not

2659.839 --> 2665.359
proportional to the atomic mass

2663.839 --> 2666.64
you get that

2665.359 --> 2668.4
gas

2666.64 --> 2672.64
when you weigh it

2668.4 --> 2675.28
is not proportional to the atomic mass

2672.64 --> 2678.72
understand because it doesn't actually

2675.28 --> 2681.119
have mass the material has mass

2678.72 --> 2682.64
but not in a gaseous state

2681.119 --> 2685.88
because in a gaseous state it doesn't

2682.64 --> 2685.8799999999997
have inertia

2690.88 --> 2694.4
it's the difference between atomic mass

2692.8 --> 2696.6400000000003
and just mass

2694.4 --> 2701.1600000000003
thought i tried to explain that

2696.64 --> 2701.16
like not even five minutes ago

2704.319 --> 2712.319
right atomic mass is

2707.04 --> 2715.44
the matter type the molecule the atoms

2712.319 --> 2721.359
calculated derived weight

2715.44 --> 2721.359
for an assumed singular atom or molecule

2721.839 --> 2724.0789999999997
right

2725.44 --> 2731.04
but that would have had to been derived

2730.0 --> 2733.599
through

2731.04 --> 2735.44
the material being in a liquid state or

2733.599 --> 2736.319
solid

2735.44 --> 2737.44
because

2736.319 --> 2740.0
if you

2737.44 --> 2741.28
have a material that is a gas and you

2740.0 --> 2744.24
cannot

2741.28 --> 2745.599
make that gas into anything other than a

2744.24 --> 2751.2
gaseous state

2745.599 --> 2751.2000000000003
you couldn't even derive the atomic mass

2751.839 --> 2756.24
think about it

2753.92 --> 2758.96
you need it to be in liquid form in

2756.24 --> 2760.4799999999996
order to truly establish

2758.96 --> 2763.76
its mass

2760.48 --> 2767.64
versus the volume to get its density to

2763.76 --> 2767.6400000000003
get the atomic mass

2783.359 --> 2788.24
or maybe it's worse maybe even have to

2785.359 --> 2790.7999999999997
get it into the solid state specifically

2788.24 --> 2790.7999999999997
i don't know i

2793.76 --> 2797.2000000000003
i used to know this sort of thing in

2795.44 --> 2798.88
detail

2797.2 --> 2800.48
back in school because i was really

2798.88 --> 2803.839
fanatical about it

2800.48 --> 2803.839
it's been a while

2807.44 --> 2812.0
put everything on his yeah that would he

2809.52 --> 2815.119
can try out yeah you don't have to tell

2812.0 --> 2817.04
me gary i know that

2815.119 --> 2818.88
yeah i know

2817.04 --> 2821.04
it's trying to make me do that but i've

2818.88 --> 2823.52
already addressed it yeah you can put

2821.04 --> 2825.52
gases on the scale if you contain it if

2823.52 --> 2827.92
you don't contain it you you're not

2825.52 --> 2831.2
gonna measure any weight anything ever

2827.92 --> 2833.119
because it's not gonna sit there

2831.2 --> 2836.8799999999997
right

2833.119 --> 2838.7200000000003
i'm stating and i'd like to

2836.88 --> 2841.359
see some

2838.72 --> 2843.68
roll out of physical evidence that i'm

2841.359 --> 2845.04
perhaps might be wrong

2843.68 --> 2846.5589999999997
and that is that

2845.04 --> 2848.64
the weight

2846.559 --> 2852.559
that you get

2848.64 --> 2854.96
from an object filled with gas

2852.559 --> 2856.559
is not going to be proportional to its

2854.96 --> 2858.7200000000003
atomic mass

2856.559 --> 2861.2000000000003
if it is a gas

2858.72 --> 2863.839
it might register some extra pressure it

2861.2 --> 2867.359
might have some weight but the weight is

2863.839 --> 2867.359
not going to be proportional

2867.599 --> 2871.6800000000003
that's my

2868.96 --> 2874.319
prediction this is my claim i'm so

2871.68 --> 2876.319
confident about this i'm willing to just

2874.319 --> 2877.68
make it a claim

2876.319 --> 2878.88
just like that

2877.68 --> 2883.2
right

2878.88 --> 2884.88
gas when weighed in gaseous state

2883.2 --> 2888.24
the weight is not going to be

2884.88 --> 2890.7200000000003
proportional to the atomic mass yeah i'm

2888.24 --> 2892.319
just saying it just like that

2890.72 --> 2896.319
prove me wrong

2892.319 --> 2899.359
prove me wrong with a demonstration

2896.319 --> 2901.119
weighing the gas and the weight being

2899.359 --> 2903.7599999999998
measured from that

2901.119 --> 2907.52
being directly proportional to the

2903.76 --> 2909.8390000000004
material the gases atomic weight

2907.52 --> 2913.04
demonstrate it to me

2909.839 --> 2914.4
and i'll retract my statement

2913.04 --> 2916.48
and be very

2914.4 --> 2918.4
flustered and confused as to why i

2916.48 --> 2920.559
thought that

2918.4 --> 2923.2000000000003
but i do think that

2920.559 --> 2925.2000000000003
and i have never seen anybody basically

2923.2 --> 2929.839
do that shove that in my face to

2925.2 --> 2929.839
disprove my assertion about it

2940.0 --> 2944.96
what

2941.359 --> 2947.359
carbon dioxide cannot form a liquid

2944.96 --> 2947.359
what

2947.76 --> 2950.88
what are you getting that

2955.839 --> 2960.48
no that's that doesn't make any sense

2967.359 --> 2974.0
is that really true

2970.96 --> 2974.0
i've never heard of that

2976.079 --> 2979.3590000000004
but anyway yeah

2977.52 --> 2982.24
in a solid form yeah you can also

2979.359 --> 2985.7599999999998
establish an atomic mass

2982.24 --> 2988.0
or yeah yeah so

2985.76 --> 2990.7200000000003
the only the whole point is you can't

2988.0 --> 2993.04
establish it through just a gas only

2990.72 --> 2993.04
state

2996.079 --> 3003.04
will there be some extra weight

2999.359 --> 3003.04
even though it's not proportional

3005.68 --> 3011.52
it depends

3008.0 --> 3013.04
if that gas in

3011.52 --> 3014.72
in a container

3013.04 --> 3017.599
is actually

3014.72 --> 3021.04
less dense than the regular air that

3017.599 --> 3022.6400000000003
surrounds it while it's being weighed

3021.04 --> 3024.8
then

3022.64 --> 3027.68
perhaps it will not even

3024.8 --> 3029.8390000000004
it will give anti-weight

3027.68 --> 3031.52
it will actually relieve some of the

3029.839 --> 3034.7999999999997
weight

3031.52 --> 3039.0
because yeah it is being calculated

3034.8 --> 3039.0
through the offset with the medium

3072.64 --> 3074.96
hmm

3081.44 --> 3083.839
what

3086.64 --> 3089.359
oh god

3089.839 --> 3095.52
yeah sorry dude i am not a star at like

3092.64 --> 3098.319
the formula shorts in physics that was

3095.52 --> 3098.319
never my thing

3107.52 --> 3111.48
yeah

3108.48 --> 3111.48
okay

3118.88 --> 3123.28
it's impossible from a solid to gas

3121.28 --> 3126.0
without first being liquid no that's not

3123.28 --> 3127.52
true it's actually that's i don't know

3126.0 --> 3129.599
where you're getting that information

3127.52 --> 3132.8
from gary

3129.599 --> 3135.119
but it actually is has a special name

3132.8 --> 3137.92
the effects

3135.119 --> 3140.8
from a solid directly into a gas

3137.92 --> 3143.599
actually has its own name

3140.8 --> 3145.52
okay and the reverse from a gas directly

3143.599 --> 3147.119
into a solid as well

3145.52 --> 3150.319
so i don't know where you're getting

3147.119 --> 3153.2000000000003
that information from but that's very

3150.319 --> 3156.64
very wrong

3153.2 --> 3158.5589999999997
it is absolutely not impossible from

3156.64 --> 3161.359
for a solid to go

3158.559 --> 3163.119
directly into gaseous state without a

3161.359 --> 3167.64
liquid transition

3163.119 --> 3167.6400000000003
right it has its own freaking name

3172.8 --> 3180.54
let me look up what that name is

3177.43 --> 3180.54
[Applause]

3181.599 --> 3187.599
sublimation that's right that's the word

3185.119 --> 3191.2000000000003
it's called sublimation

3187.599 --> 3193.839
yeah so if it if that effect has its own

3191.2 --> 3196.24
name officially

3193.839 --> 3198.16
it's pretty safe to say that you do have

3196.24 --> 3203.24
that i don't know where you said that

3198.16 --> 3203.24
gary makes you sound very ill-informed

3226.88 --> 3233.2000000000003
yeah and from a gas directly into a

3229.76 --> 3233.2000000000003
solid is called deep

3234.839 --> 3241.52
position based on depositing

3238.079 --> 3241.52
right so that is also a thing

3244.079 --> 3248.559
now

3245.359 --> 3252.88
from a gas to a solid is the position

3248.559 --> 3255.119
from a solid directly into a gas is

3252.88 --> 3257.92
sublimation

3255.119 --> 3257.92
right that's why

3292.72 --> 3297.4399999999996
yeah now gary you were just monumentally

3295.92 --> 3299.04
wrong

3297.44 --> 3300.64
and you didn't double check what you

3299.04 --> 3306.0
were saying

3300.64 --> 3307.839
yeah it's not the first time yeah dude

3306.0 --> 3310.559
to everybody in chat you might not be

3307.839 --> 3315.7599999999998
aware of this but here gary here

3310.559 --> 3315.76
is sending me like pretty insane emails

3317.76 --> 3324.079
like pages of [ __ ] just like mark smiler

3321.359 --> 3326.72
even though he's not identifying as him

3324.079 --> 3330.0
not even talking about magnets but he's

3326.72 --> 3330.0
trying to pull just

3330.079 --> 3334.799
dude you you're not

3333.2 --> 3337.4399999999996
as smart

3334.799 --> 3339.52
as you think you are yeah i don't think

3337.44 --> 3341.44
there's anything i can personally learn

3339.52 --> 3343.68
from you

3341.44 --> 3346.2400000000002

the email to everybody on screen

3361.599 --> 3364.6400000000003
because like that's

3363.839 --> 3368.0789999999997

i'm not gonna read it out loud you're

3799.119 --> 3805.2000000000003
gonna have to zoom in and maybe

3802.64 --> 3808.68
halt the stream put it on pause so you

3805.2 --> 3808.68
can read it

3815.44 --> 3820.4
you clearly have a mental delusion that

3818.0 --> 3823.2
is forcing you into the worst possible

3820.4 --> 3825.44
financial situation you can possibly

3823.2 --> 3828.0789999999997
come up with

3825.44 --> 3829.119
all the while screaming you would like

3828.079 --> 3830.96
to get

3829.119 --> 3834.2400000000002

do i do i scream about wanting to get

3834.24 --> 3837.4399999999996
out of my situation

3836.24 --> 3839.9199999999996
do i

3837.44 --> 3842.319
or do i just ask hey

to the freaking demonic beast world out

3888.88 --> 3891.44
there

3889.76 --> 3893.8390000000004
where everybody thinks they can just

3891.44 --> 3896.079
chisel away at everything natural about

3893.839 --> 3897.2
them until they become this freaking

3896.079 --> 3900.079
drone

3897.2 --> 3901.5989999999997
that can get around in society have this

3900.079 --> 3904.559
apparent

3901.599 --> 3907.52
respect from people

3904.559 --> 3910.48
while they're all filled with delusions

3907.52 --> 3912.88
and envy and hatred

3910.48 --> 3916.2400000000002
disrespect

3912.88 --> 3916.2400000000002

3928.16 --> 3932.48
worries about money

3929.92 --> 3936.96
yeah but i do this because i like doing

3932.48 --> 3938.96

3936.96 --> 3941.28
in this situation where i don't have all

3938.96 --> 3943.039
the money in the world i like doing this

3941.28 --> 3946.48

pointless because i can't make a really

4316.08 --> 4321.12
good point with it he's just he's just

4318.56 --> 4324.8
at homing this is everything he said is

4321.12 --> 4327.199

4324.8 --> 4327.1990000000005
even

4327.36 --> 4331.839999999999
in physics so he literally doesn't even

4329.92 --> 4334.08
know physics all that well and you're

4331.84 --> 4337.1990000000005
gonna manage me are you

4334.08 --> 4339.04

4450.64 --> 4455.84
best show on the end i appreciate that

4452.48 --> 4458.718999999999
steamy traveler i really do

4455.84 --> 4458.719
i don't know though

4459.199 --> 4464.159
i mean i do like to think of myself as a

4462.08 --> 4466.159
person of interest for a whole bunch of

4464.159 --> 4469.759999999999
people out there especially those that

4466.159 --> 4473.199
like to get a grip on fractal thinking

4469.76 --> 4474.64
basically other dimensional interfacing

4473.199 --> 4476.0
waking

4474.64 --> 4477.280000000001
through understanding yeah i know

4476.0 --> 4478.8
there's a whole bunch of people that

4477.28 --> 4482.199
must be

4478.8 --> 4482.1990000000005
very interested

4482.88 --> 4489.679
is it the best show on the internet

4486.8 --> 4489.679
i don't know man

4491.44 --> 4496.0
maybe to some

4494.08 --> 4498.8
i mean i don't think i'm the best show

4496.0 --> 4501.12
on the internet when i watch it back but

4498.8 --> 4503.4400000000005
i have really good moments though i

4501.12 --> 4507.44
really do i'm very proud of them

4503.44 --> 4510.159
it's just not like a consistent thing

4507.44 --> 4512.719
just distinct ups and downs periods when

4510.159 --> 4513.599999999999
i get kind of boring periods when i get

4512.719 --> 4515.92
a bit

4513.6 --> 4518.08
overly rowdy

4515.92 --> 4518.8
kind of like now

4518.08 --> 4521.92
and

4518.8 --> 4524.8
yeah so i am a complete person i

4521.92 --> 4526.0
i am full i am i have a lot of things to

4524.8 --> 4527.84
me

4526.0 --> 4530.8
but is the show

4527.84 --> 4531.92
the best on the in the internet

4530.8 --> 4534.159000000001
i don't know

4531.92 --> 4534.96
maybe on the long run maybe on the long

4534.159 --> 4537.5199999999995
run

4534.96 --> 4539.84
you know maybe in the long run i will

4537.52 --> 4543.4400000000005
turn out to have like a collection of

4539.84 --> 4543.4400000000005
very interesting information

4544.56 --> 4546.719
but

4550.84 --> 4555.04
yeah

4552.48 --> 4555.04
i don't know

4559.76 --> 4565.280000000001
best of arwin comp steamy traveler i

4562.56 --> 4567.280000000001
have actually thought about that but

4565.28 --> 4569.84
i don't even have the patience to like

4567.28 --> 4572.5599999999995
put that all that together

4569.84 --> 4577.12
like do you know how many hours of life

4572.56 --> 4577.120000000001
[ __ ] i have is unbelievable

4579.6 --> 4584.2390000000005
it's like too much

4581.28 --> 4587.04
i think it would literally be easier if

4584.239 --> 4591.678999999999
i literally summarized it

4587.04 --> 4591.679
just verbally myself just redo it

4592.56 --> 4595.6
hey dusty ryder

4599.199 --> 4606.5199999999995
what's gary with no r's

yay yeah yeah yeah good point

4621.04 --> 4623.84

4625.52 --> 4630.320000000001
it's so disgusting man i'm still creeped

4628.0 --> 4633.04

4630.32 --> 4634.799999999999

4633.04 --> 4638.56
don't care

just like i i'm not looking for some

4638.56 --> 4647.320000000001
daddy to manage me okay

4643.04 --> 4647.32
i [ __ ] hate that

4652.64 --> 4659.76
i am not some hollywood tool

4657.04 --> 4663.88
yeah i'm not a tool

4659.76 --> 4663.88
that needs managing

4664.56 --> 4670.4800000000005
i just need finances just that

4668.08 --> 4673.44
and it's never gonna be ideal and in a

4670.48 --> 4676.639999999999
way maybe it's not supposed to be maybe

4673.44 --> 4679.12
right maybe if i get too much money it

4676.64 --> 4681.679
would interrupt what i do

4679.12 --> 4683.44
and the way i do it maybe that's it

4681.679 --> 4685.679
maybe

4683.44 --> 4687.839999999999
i will get it at some point and maybe

4685.679 --> 4690.64
it's only at the time when i'm finally

4687.84 --> 4692.88
ready for that it's just i don't

4690.64 --> 4697.1990000000005
want to think

4692.88 --> 4701.4400000000005
about and prioritize money it gets in my

4697.199 --> 4705.04
way it distracts me it changes my mind

4701.44 --> 4708.08
and heart i don't like it

4705.04 --> 4710.32
but i don't like starving either

4708.08 --> 4710.32
right

4713.84 --> 4720.76
it's always been kind of a tough balance

4716.8 --> 4720.76
to figure out for me

4728.48 --> 4733.919999999999
no i'm the talent wow okay thank you

4731.44 --> 4736.4
steamy traveler i appreciate that

4733.92 --> 4740.0
compliment

4736.4 --> 4742.799999999999
audio visual folks yeah yeah i do

4740.0 --> 4742.8
absolutely

4745.52 --> 4751.360000000001
but hey i have it in a way partially you

4749.44 --> 4753.12
know i've had a mikan adam meekin is

4751.36 --> 4756.159
awesome and he helped me out all the

4753.12 --> 4760.12
time he made the title card again

4756.159 --> 4760.12
with today's title guard

4764.48 --> 4769.04
and he's like a great colleague and a

4767.44 --> 4771.678999999999
friend and

4769.04 --> 4774.8
a champion a fellow champion i really do

4771.679 --> 4776.4800000000005
see adam as a champion

4774.8 --> 4778.96
in all of this

4776.48 --> 4780.08
because he's really good he's really

4778.96 --> 4782.8
careful

4780.08 --> 4785.28
he's much much better at math than i am

4782.8 --> 4787.52
much better and look i am not a star at

4785.28 --> 4789.04
math okay

4787.52 --> 4791.679
i never was

4789.04 --> 4793.12
i got it in school i got through it but

4791.679 --> 4796.64
i got through it on my freaking

4793.12 --> 4799.04
intuition okay not actually on real math

4796.64 --> 4801.1990000000005
skills so much

4799.04 --> 4801.199
just

4802.32 --> 4805.84
it's not my format

4810.0 --> 4812.4
anyway

4818.32 --> 4823.28
but yeah the idea hiring a crew is

4821.679 --> 4825.1990000000005
interesting but yeah you need freaking

4823.28 --> 4826.88
money for that so

4825.199 --> 4830.08
that's gonna have to then change

4826.88 --> 4830.08
everything that i do

4831.28 --> 4834.239
do i want that

4834.48 --> 4836.799999999999
no

4837.28 --> 4841.84
i like this raw freedom

4842.32 --> 4847.12
and in a way i am trying to represent

4844.56 --> 4851.52
something i'm trying to represent a raw

4847.12 --> 4852.639
freedom that is not altered by the world

4851.52 --> 4855.92
as in

4852.639 --> 4858.400000000001
it has to change a way to adapt no i

4855.92 --> 4861.28
like that rawness and it's actually much

4858.4 --> 4864.08
more difficult than you can imagine to

4861.28 --> 4867.04
retain it in the face of everything that

4864.08 --> 4870.239
happens you see almost everybody that

4867.04 --> 4872.159
gets into a media thing

4870.239 --> 4876.5599999999995
videos

4872.159 --> 4878.879999999999
they always end up adapting and becoming

4876.56 --> 4882.56
some standard blend

4878.88 --> 4885.4400000000005
a blend of media to kind of oh but that

4882.56 --> 4888.719

4885.44 --> 4891.28
to adapt it so that we don't offend this

4888.719 --> 4894.88
and that and it all becomes a giant

4891.28 --> 4897.04
convoluted stupid soup of information

4894.88 --> 4901.04
with barely anything interesting that's

4897.04 --> 4903.12

whatever or if you're like

4991.04 --> 4995.6
if you only wouldn't do that

4993.6 --> 4997.679
yeah i don't really know i just do what

4995.6 --> 5001.84
i do when i do it

4997.679 --> 5001.84
and hopefully it'll be worth it

5001.92 --> 5007.36
but yeah overall i did have a lot of

5005.04 --> 5009.44
activities out there

5007.36 --> 5011.12
yesterday evening

5009.44 --> 5015.678999999999
the whole night

5011.12 --> 5017.679
like even in the recording of uh

5015.679 --> 5019.84
kiwi's numpty clip

5017.679 --> 5023.36
with bob the pseudoscience i am in there

5019.84 --> 5025.360000000001
i was there it was it was fun by the way

5023.36 --> 5027.36
i think i'm gonna try to seek out those

5025.36 --> 5029.199
types of rooms more often because it was

5027.36 --> 5032.32
just a very interesting heated

5029.199 --> 5032.32
conversation in there

5032.56 --> 5035.719
all right

5044.96 --> 5050.2390000000005
right so again

5047.199 --> 5052.4
if you like what i do

5050.239 --> 5057.28
you might not always like it but if you

5052.4 --> 5060.5599999999995
still over time appreciate my influence

5057.28 --> 5063.44
on here on the flat earth debates and on

5060.56 --> 5064.4800000000005
in other places ball busters

5063.44 --> 5065.5199999999995
chats

5064.48 --> 5068.5599999999995
maybe

5065.52 --> 5070.639
me getting to certain types of anti-flat

5068.56 --> 5073.1990000000005
earthers maybe you like that right i am

5070.639 --> 5075.52
kind of a lightning rod like that

5073.199 --> 5076.32
if you like that the by all means you

5075.52 --> 5078.080000000001
know

5076.32 --> 5081.92
support me

5078.08 --> 5083.84
because i really do need support

5081.92 --> 5086.4800000000005
right and unfortunately i have no

5083.84 --> 5089.1990000000005
products for sale

5086.48 --> 5091.759999999999
not like that i give it for free me

5089.199 --> 5093.678999999999
doing shows be being active at it that

5091.76 --> 5097.1990000000005
is my product

5093.679 --> 5099.1990000000005
and i unfortunately can't just

5097.199 --> 5101.12
auto cache it

5099.199 --> 5103.5199999999995
doesn't work like that it's gonna have

5101.12 --> 5105.84
to be voluntary

5103.52 --> 5108.56
and i really hope you guys

5105.84 --> 5110.96
will continue supporting me

5108.56 --> 5112.719
and on a regular basis like

5110.96 --> 5115.6
sometimes i almost feel like it's

5112.719 --> 5118.159
unreasonable asking what i do

5115.6 --> 5119.120000000001
because i don't know if i would

5118.159 --> 5121.12
do it

5119.12 --> 5123.679
but then again i'm not in that position

5121.12 --> 5126.4
in order to properly judge the balance

5123.679 --> 5129.28
of that situation because i am kind of

5126.4 --> 5132.08
like the poor one here

5129.28 --> 5132.08
it's difficult

5133.679 --> 5138.08
but yeah please donate to my paypal i

5136.239 --> 5141.919999999999
really need it

5138.08 --> 5144.32
and it will help the quality of what i

5141.92 --> 5146.88
do it really does it has in the past

5144.32 --> 5146.88
palpably

5147.44 --> 5152.32
the immediate sigh of relief immediate

5150.08 --> 5154.88
refocus

5152.32 --> 5157.199
usually drive yeah

5154.88 --> 5159.36
not having to worry about money usually

5157.199 --> 5161.759999999999
immediately stares my mind this is not

5159.36 --> 5163.92
even something that i plan it literally

5161.76 --> 5166.96
just works like that it just immediately

5163.92 --> 5168.96
steers my mind away from

5166.96 --> 5171.44
more agitated

5168.96 --> 5175.199
subjects into work towards more

5171.44 --> 5175.199
interesting curiosities

5176.48 --> 5179.199
so yeah

5179.6 --> 5183.56
that's just how it works

5186.56 --> 5192.04
i didn't have much to add to this one

5189.04 --> 5192.04
lol

5196.32 --> 5201.12
yeah

5197.92 --> 5202.159
