you

42.61 --> 44.67
you

45.41 --> 49.66
Guu

47.44 --> 52.51
morning welcome to Flat Earth early-bird

49.66 --> 54.01
number 419 I'm your host

52.51 --> 55.75
Arwen and before we start the show

54.01 --> 57.849999999999994
please don't forget to share it on any

55.75 --> 59.62
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

57.85 --> 61.269
already subscribed to my channel and hit

59.62 --> 63.159
the bell notification so you know when

61.269 --> 66.61
I'm going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

63.159 --> 69.82
Amsterdam time every day although today

66.61 --> 71.71
is a little bit early yeah usually 2

69.82 --> 74.13999999999999
p.m. after damn time and yeah please

71.71 --> 76.99
also do support me through the paypal

74.14 --> 81.07
patreon my GoFundMe and the super Jets I

76.99 --> 83.05
kind of need it again because yeah I had

81.07 --> 87.369
some support and that was very useful

83.05 --> 92.17
what its kind of run out sorry to say

87.369 --> 95.289
I've been trying to do very very small

92.17 --> 98.409
time so smart investing food and all

95.289 --> 101.229
that but yeah it's just so please guys

98.409 --> 105.159
girls support me if you can especially

101.229 --> 109.539
through the paypal yes

105.159 --> 112.119
so today the weather is the it's rainy

109.539 --> 115.209
you can you can see the droplets on the

112.119 --> 122.849
window there it's just kind of raining

115.209 --> 122.849
all the time not very hard but yeah

123.51 --> 127.95
not the most appealing of weathers to go

126.0 --> 130.89
through I don't have to do my newspaper

127.95 --> 131.76
rounds today great but oh well is what

130.89 --> 137.60999999999999
it is

131.76 --> 139.76999999999998
Thank You Nathan for the points seven

137.61 --> 146.06
nine pound super chat donation much

139.77 --> 146.06
appreciated yeah let's go through jet

150.86 --> 160.17000000000002
Martin Ellen was first Tom Parker dank

155.03 --> 160.71
mark Marshall Amanda young Joseph three

160.17 --> 165.48
six nine

160.71 --> 167.52
he's an Oakley over McCool good to see

165.48 --> 171.63
you all sir

167.52 --> 174.51000000000002
yeah start a bit early though man yeah

171.63 --> 179.25
I've been up way too late again yes it

174.51 --> 182.97
was just stupid but I did have a lot of

179.25 --> 187.83
fun you had this game this new game it

182.97 --> 191.45
is kind of a fun new distraction yeah

187.83 --> 194.28
should be playing it so long non-stop

191.45 --> 196.709
but yes new games what'd you get it's

194.28 --> 200.63
kind of fun though it's it's pretty

196.709 --> 203.88
basic game but it's still fun

200.63 --> 206.28
so yeah other than that I haven't really

203.88 --> 208.41
watched too many hangouts I didn't watch

206.28 --> 211.02
ran T's though up until the point where

208.41 --> 213.84
Brenda got on and then I thought like

211.02 --> 216.209
yeah I'm not gonna sit through that

213.84 --> 218.37
because Brenda as expected

216.209 --> 220.14000000000001
did what she always does according to

218.37 --> 220.98000000000002
her methods you know which one I'm

220.14 --> 224.16
talking about

220.98 --> 226.53
just get in and just start out declaring

224.16 --> 232.17
oh no it's got it all wrong everything

226.53 --> 234.27
is wrong yes at this point soon as

232.17 --> 239.92999999999998
Brenda joins anything it's instantly a

234.27 --> 239.93
waste of time she's become that bad

240.09 --> 244.44
love letters spaceman

255.78 --> 258.819
[Music]

262.3 --> 265.05
so

268.92 --> 277.35
hey five to eight I start a bit early so

274.47 --> 281.13000000000005
then yeah usually the the downfall pile

277.35 --> 286.35
comes exactly at two o'clock or right

281.13 --> 289.29
before it but anyway doesn't really

286.35 --> 291.09000000000003
matter too much it's just I yeah I just

289.29 --> 302.37
hope that people don't forget to have

291.09 --> 308.96999999999997
that's all was very active at the debate

302.37 --> 313.85
yesterday kind of blank at the moment as

308.97 --> 313.85
to what it was even about at the time

316.09 --> 320.08
oh yeah there wasn't happy ever after

318.22 --> 328.6
show as well I don't know if Randy's

320.08 --> 330.78
played it yet Jack no I don't think he

328.6 --> 330.78000000000003
has

333.11 --> 337.24
right it's just Brian

354.1 --> 365.67
hey Laurie hey if you can do better you

357.24 --> 365.67
know Hey look who's talking Laurie

373.51 --> 381.53999999999996
and by the way welcome to jet Oh mother

377.41 --> 381.54
Salim is also here in YouTube

384.78 --> 391.9
yeah well nathan has done better in the

387.31 --> 394.26
past as well so you know no Fyodor

391.9 --> 394.26
Dostoevsky

406.54 --> 409.68
hello ranty

413.62 --> 416.62
yeah

427.86 --> 430.67
see

433.71 --> 444.68
oh yeah well Nathan Oakley I think he

440.91 --> 444.68
did he did one time yes

451.09 --> 454.19
[Music]

461.52 --> 467.389
yeah I didn't watch your video feed or

464.49 --> 467.389
sorry

487.57 --> 496.33
hey the studio 68 all right well anyway

493.6 --> 498.70000000000005
yeah concerning the ferry they

496.33 --> 502.39
happy-ever-after show or the after show

498.7 --> 506.5
after party I asked Adam to make an

502.39 --> 510.72999999999996
animation for me and he just did it like

506.5 --> 513.34
really quickly and yeah I will sometimes

510.73 --> 520.09
I guess in the evenings be premiering

513.34 --> 522.25
the the ever after show and yeah

520.09 --> 526.4200000000001
sometimes right Randy had this great

522.25 --> 529.06
idea that we could roulette everybody

526.42 --> 532.3299999999999
could do a stream that is typically only

529.06 --> 533.8599999999999
I have ever after show to stream it

532.33 --> 537.97
every now and then I thought it was a

533.86 --> 541.72
great idea but yeah at for the starters

537.97 --> 544.48
I kind of wouldn't mind back and forth

541.72 --> 547.02
thing with him with you Randy that would

544.48 --> 547.02
be great

555.11 --> 561.36
[Music]

557.14 --> 564.36
oh and also thank you for the wrench I

561.36 --> 564.36
guess

567.19 --> 586.5100000000001
you kind of earned one as well anyway

581.85 --> 592.38
yeah there's some more people that kind

586.51 --> 592.38
of deserve it see

605.86 --> 608.86
yeah

615.02 --> 618.09
[Music]

629.29 --> 641.14
well mother Salim in the earth is a

631.33 --> 643.69
closed system it always was yeah and for

641.14 --> 645.6999999999999
you guys in the chat and everybody

643.69 --> 647.1700000000001
watching yes sir I'm kind of blanked out

645.7 --> 653.11
right now so I'm gonna be very

647.17 --> 654.91
reflective towards Jeff I don't know

653.11 --> 661.9
everything I've heard in the last few

654.91 --> 664.4499999999999
days has been so developed that I'm

661.9 --> 668.9499999999999
having a big trouble now kind of sizing

664.45 --> 674.86
up it's like it seems so many things are

668.95 --> 680.23
just yeah well basically going right in

674.86 --> 682.6
a way you could say yeah although

680.23 --> 685.74
there's there's just so much stuff going

682.6 --> 689.35
on also in politics Iran it's just

685.74 --> 691.77
getting pretty bizarre and interesting

689.35 --> 694.89
and but

691.77 --> 694.89
[Music]

695.58 --> 700.6500000000001
I don't know I don't exactly have a

698.49 --> 703.32
story on my chest that I need to tell at

700.65 --> 706.22
the moment but definitely up for

703.32 --> 706.22
questions though

724.83 --> 732.0600000000001
and Orthodox oh are you still subscribed

729.63 --> 739.26
and and everything through the show or

732.06 --> 743.79
not oh yeah right I thought I thought

739.26 --> 745.65
you meant that the Glovers are going all

743.79 --> 751.3499999999999
over the place but yeah they get they

745.65 --> 756.66
gotta go somewhere and well it usually

751.35 --> 759.36
ends up in more doublespeak positions in

756.66 --> 761.4599999999999
certain arguments like with the Coriolis

759.36 --> 764.49
effect doublespeak position everybody

761.46 --> 766.529
kind of was like open Glo system rumpus

764.49 --> 768.21
was already switching called he was

766.529 --> 771.99
already kind of double speaking on it

768.21 --> 773.85
and it's got to get more drastic I think

771.99 --> 775.62
that more other people are also gonna

773.85 --> 777.779
get the same type of issue gonna follow

775.62 --> 783.63
in his tracks whether they like it or

777.779 --> 785.43
not and I don't know I think it's gonna

783.63 --> 788.0889999999999
be pretty much same old same old

785.43 --> 788.0889999999999
eventually

799.43 --> 803.4499999999999
all right now I remember something yeah

801.83 --> 805.49
it was interesting wasn't on the ever

803.45 --> 808.61
after show or was it um just you have to

805.49 --> 817.67
show I don't remember but yeah

808.61 --> 821.36
anakata yeah well you deserve it yeah I

817.67 --> 824.4499999999999
had an interesting kind of a new insight

821.36 --> 828.85
that she had completely new lights have

824.45 --> 836.24
unintended on the situation concerning

828.85 --> 841.61
the double-slit experiment the the the

836.24 --> 844.46
refraction effect because there are some

841.61 --> 848.72
weird things going on and this is just

844.46 --> 851.1800000000001
serious and I started asking John about

848.72 --> 853.52
it and he was very forthcoming and just

851.18 --> 856.1899999999999
so he was like it eager moment when

853.52 --> 859.31
finally that hole opens up and like whoa

856.19 --> 863.3800000000001
dig dang and I got some really

859.31 --> 868.04
interesting concepts out of it because

863.38 --> 870.41
yeah weirdly enough we all know roughly

868.04 --> 873.5
now about light go through double slits

870.41 --> 877.25
if it is a very specific spectrum of

873.5 --> 880.88
light it will diffract in a very

877.25 --> 885.14
specific wave-like pattern not wave it's

880.88 --> 887.72
just yeah you can extrapolate the

885.14 --> 889.31
pattern and then falsely concludes a

887.72 --> 893.0
wave because it's wave-like it's not a

889.31 --> 896.42
wave the result just seemed like as if

893.0 --> 901.16
it were with but it's not and deeper

896.42 --> 903.38
testing would would show that but what I

901.16 --> 905.63
thought was so interesting just looking

903.38 --> 907.55
at the mechanic itself mechanic itself

905.63 --> 909.65
because what basically happens is that

907.55 --> 912.68
it doesn't really even matter too much

909.65 --> 914.6899999999999
what you presume you are shooting

912.68 --> 916.3399999999999
through those double slits and not

914.69 --> 919.85
talking about the quantum eraser now

916.34 --> 924.2
thing the knowing which path but just

919.85 --> 927.2
purely the diffracting effect so with

924.2 --> 929.57
light it does that well apparently up to

927.2 --> 931.0500000000001
a certain degree with matter it does the

929.57 --> 938.25
same thing

931.05 --> 942.9599999999999
not but yeah the wave effect comes into

938.25 --> 946.41
play how about that so actual multi

942.96 --> 950.13
molecular part or yeah what is it multi

946.41 --> 955.5
atomic particles right multi atomic

950.13 --> 959.31
would also start refracting by the

955.5 --> 961.89
double slit in the Saved wave alike

959.31 --> 963.2399999999999
pattern how how fascinating is that and

961.89 --> 966.87
there is even a direct correlation

963.24 --> 969.99
between and this is the big thing

966.87 --> 975.84
it's not about mass or size or no it's

969.99 --> 979.23
about relative speed that was really

975.84 --> 980.5500000000001
something that really hit me so it

979.23 --> 983.4
doesn't really matter what you're gonna

980.55 --> 985.68
shoot through these slits whether it's a

983.4 --> 987.87
particle or whether it is light which I

985.68 --> 990.5699999999999
definitely think is not like molecules

987.87 --> 994.08
not like atoms not of the same nature

990.57 --> 996.1800000000001
but it does have a speed and that speed

994.08 --> 1001.64
can slow down and speed up how about

996.18 --> 1008.26
that and all of the combination of the

1001.64 --> 1014.87
speed right the combination of the speed

1008.26 --> 1019.13
matters in how much it waves out how

1014.87 --> 1023.54
wide how basically how deep the

1019.13 --> 1025.9
refraction effect is because well you

1023.54 --> 1025.8999999999999
could say

1027.66 --> 1033.8200000000002
the slower it goes like red light while

1031.6 --> 1038.4099999999999
blue light goes faster this red light

1033.82 --> 1041.9399999999998
will wave out wider a blue light is

1038.41 --> 1045.3390000000002
faster so it will it will deflect less

1041.94 --> 1047.0800000000002
let's go faster and it's yeah that the

1045.339 --> 1049.4199999999998
funny thing is you could compare it and

1047.08 --> 1054.25
I even said it at the time it's just

1049.42 --> 1057.5500000000002
like shooting past specifically past a

1054.25 --> 1061.21
flat surface even if it is relatively

1057.55 --> 1063.1299999999999
short and afterwards like shooting over

1061.21 --> 1067.99
a table or something and just really

1063.13 --> 1071.19
close by over it passing by it and yeah

1067.99 --> 1073.57
will alter the path oh yeah like

1071.19 --> 1076.5700000000002
refraction it will offer the path and

1073.57 --> 1078.6699999999998
you could give several such kinds of

1076.57 --> 1081.6
reason as to why one of them would be

1078.67 --> 1084.9
that the turbulence effect will be

1081.6 --> 1087.9399999999998
unbalanced because the pressures will

1084.9 --> 1090.01
surrounding that bullet will not be the

1087.94 --> 1093.43
same because it's going past that flat

1090.01 --> 1097.27
surface there will not be any as much

1093.43 --> 1099.5800000000002
pressure build-up from the air getting

1097.27 --> 1102.25
compressed because there's less air

1099.58 --> 1104.1999999999998
there so that the pressure higher will

1102.25 --> 1107.92
be more and then it will deflect

1104.2 --> 1110.17
downwards yes and that's exactly just

1107.92 --> 1113.74
like things through the double slit it's

1110.17 --> 1117.22
amazing the correlation but here's the

1113.74 --> 1120.79
big thing doesn't really help prove the

1117.22 --> 1123.49
nature of these things it only shows the

1120.79 --> 1126.87
correlation of deflection through

1123.49 --> 1130.0
refraction and speed is involved

1126.87 --> 1134.86
linearly in a way now there are

1130.0 --> 1137.68
something so it doesn't prove whether

1134.86 --> 1141.4299999999998
it's apart because particles and light

1137.68 --> 1146.49
and anything you fire through there will

1141.43 --> 1146.49
do that how about that

1147.149 --> 1160.57
just blew my mind really but yeah light

1157.899 --> 1163.1999999999998
is not a wave just to point at it again

1160.57 --> 1168.9399999999998
light is definitely not a wave because

1163.2 --> 1171.669
waves propel through matter and if there

1168.94 --> 1173.3200000000002
is no more matter to propel through or

1171.669 --> 1175.99
it is not strong enough then it will

1173.32 --> 1179.6789999999999
dissipate and will fade out it will

1175.99 --> 1184.02
literally die and light is exactly the

1179.679 --> 1184.02
opposite it's exactly the opposite

1184.169 --> 1190.99
it doesn't necessarily die down well it

1188.35 --> 1194.6789999999999
reflects from its path or it gets

1190.99 --> 1198.97
absorbed and the less matter is there in

1194.679 --> 1202.299
order to do that reflect or absorb the

1198.97 --> 1206.5
less energy it will lose actually they

1202.299 --> 1210.52
may even speed up relatively to thicker

1206.5 --> 1212.38
mediums so it's completely the opposite

1210.52 --> 1216.8799999999999
of what waves are like it actually

1212.38 --> 1218.679
doesn't yeah the contrary so it's yeah

1216.88 --> 1223.72
it's no matter how you look at it lights

1218.679 --> 1228.25
not a wave but it's not like matter

1223.72 --> 1232.48
either so that's why I have to say yeah

1228.25 --> 1235.57
yeah I think think presume that I'm

1232.48 --> 1242.08
aiming for it that light is a infinitely

1235.57 --> 1245.86
divisible beam of energy it does have a

1242.08 --> 1248.5
speed and you could say okay infinitely

1245.86 --> 1251.83
split a particle but that that kind of

1248.5 --> 1253.72
contradicts what we typically assume

1251.83 --> 1256.12
with particles in the first place and

1253.72 --> 1260.52
that is an indivisible nature so by

1256.12 --> 1264.52
taking that away a beam a vector a line

1260.52 --> 1267.1299999999999
of energy that can be infinitely thin I

1264.52 --> 1270.029
think to me is more sensible to think it

1267.13 --> 1270.029
like about it like that

1274.61 --> 1277.79
[Music]

1288.51 --> 1291.64
[Music]

1298.67 --> 1310.3400000000001
now wave is an effect a wave is an

1302.6 --> 1313.01
effect it's not a substance it's an

1310.34 --> 1318.05
effect subjected to something else

1313.01 --> 1323.0
matter and light is its own energy it

1318.05 --> 1326.48
definitely has its own energy and that

1323.0 --> 1329.09
energy kind of opposes matter it opposes

1326.48 --> 1332.24
in the sense that it will be absorbed by

1329.09 --> 1334.07
that matter changing it somewhat the

1332.24 --> 1338.15
electrics and all that for the electrics

1334.07 --> 1344.6899999999998
or it will be deflected reflected all

1338.15 --> 1347.9
kinds of things but light is not an

1344.69 --> 1352.3
effect matter is subjected to it is its

1347.9 --> 1352.3000000000002
own energy something separate

1357.36 --> 1366.79
so like with a wave say sound wave you

1362.11 --> 1368.7099999999998
can't size up the or you can literally

1366.79 --> 1372.61
measure the energy you know you can only

1368.71 --> 1375.6100000000001
deduce the force of it you could say by

1372.61 --> 1378.1899999999998
the amplitude and by how much force the

1375.61 --> 1382.53
material is being subjected to because

1378.19 --> 1387.19
of the intensity of the wave but that's

1382.53 --> 1389.92
still an effect its energy the matter is

1387.19 --> 1394.72
objected to because a wave is not a

1389.92 --> 1395.66
thing it's an effect the light is not

1394.72 --> 1398.809
the same

1395.66 --> 1398.809
[Music]

1420.51 --> 1429.39
oh and by the way all of this what I've

1425.13 --> 1433.679
just said and my statements don't mean

1429.39 --> 1436.5590000000002
that now I'm you know that I'm siding

1433.679 --> 1439.049
with John or anything for those that may

1436.559 --> 1442.6499999999999
still think out that out there because I

1439.049 --> 1445.41
am still kind of holding back though in

1442.65 --> 1447.5400000000002
wait because there's at this moment not

1445.41 --> 1451.3200000000002
a lot I can do but I'm kind of still

1447.54 --> 1455.82
waiting for that and real empirical

1451.32 --> 1458.6689999999999
proof that what satisfied me convinced

1455.82 --> 1462.049
me not just some reports it has to be

1458.669 --> 1467.1000000000001
actual like video evidence or something

1462.049 --> 1473.01
something real that the knowing which

1467.1 --> 1475.559
path phenomena is real the wave function

1473.01 --> 1478.64
the wave function the apparent wave

1475.559 --> 1483.09
collapse the way the refraction effect

1478.64 --> 1484.7700000000002
collapse that that is a real thing I you

1483.09 --> 1486.33
know I know how it's supposed to work I

1484.77 --> 1489.179
get the mechanics I get all the

1486.33 --> 1492.12
complications I also see that there's a

1489.179 --> 1494.1000000000001
big issue even reports out there of

1492.12 --> 1497.6599999999999
people that have actually been trying to

1494.1 --> 1503.9399999999998
do it with equipment so there's an issue

1497.66 --> 1506.15
concerning what is a light particle with

1503.94 --> 1506.15
it

1507.45 --> 1514.26
so but yeah I haven't I just haven't

1512.13 --> 1518.25
personally seen it so I can't just say

1514.26 --> 1521.04
yes I that's a real thing I'm gonna lean

1518.25 --> 1522.75
on that for the structures that I'm

1521.04 --> 1525.24
gonna reason about no I don't do that

1522.75 --> 1527.67
because I haven't really seen it proven

1525.24 --> 1529.92
to be fair I have totally get the

1527.67 --> 1532.23
concept by now though it took some time

1529.92 --> 1535.17
it is difficult even to just get it

1532.23 --> 1540.1200000000001
but actually see the proof I haven't I

1535.17 --> 1542.16
really haven't so far so yeah all of

1540.12 --> 1545.01
this is not over yet but I will

1542.16 --> 1547.8600000000001
absolutely stand by John's side every

1545.01 --> 1550.14
time some idiot starts to assert that

1547.86 --> 1557.2199999999998
light is supposedly a wave because it's

1550.14 --> 1560.13
not and I know exactly why it isn't well

1557.22 --> 1567.1200000000001
Martin Ellen look he did try you know

1560.13 --> 1571.14
it's it's like something that yeah it's

1567.12 --> 1574.1399999999999
just they do especially John does like

1571.14 --> 1576.8700000000001
the kind of at times push me away talk

1574.14 --> 1582.1100000000001
down to me and then immediately rub over

1576.87 --> 1585.27
his specific assertions about things and

1582.11 --> 1586.9499999999998
yeah and if I go against that he'll

1585.27 --> 1589.26
start comparing me to a non-linearity

1586.95 --> 1591.24
it's just stupid it's annoying

1589.26 --> 1594.33
I can always start yeah and you know if

1591.24 --> 1596.7
I keep on defending every time he does

1594.33 --> 1601.56
that then we'll just be fighting

1596.7 --> 1604.0800000000002
constantly as long as I can just clear

1601.56 --> 1606.0
things up every now and then and hey I

1604.08 --> 1612.24
have my show to do it too you know so

1606.0 --> 1614.13
it's up to him but yes I do find it very

1612.24 --> 1616.94
annoying when he does that kind of stuff

1614.13 --> 1616.94
I do

1621.94 --> 1628.539
[Music]

1624.7 --> 1637.239
and I don't think I would [ __ ] qyup

1628.539 --> 1641.34
Martin Ellen you know I may have more

1637.239 --> 1644.98
social capability you could say right

1641.34 --> 1649.119
but I'm pretty sure that that cue is

1644.98 --> 1652.08
probably more more combatant as has

1649.119 --> 1657.82
probably had some training at least and

1652.08 --> 1658.57
so if I but I don't wanna I don't wanna

1657.82 --> 1663.07
fight

1658.57 --> 1674.109
why would I it's waste of my energy but

1663.07 --> 1675.82
metaphorically right yeah same team it

1674.109 --> 1679.119
is kind of funny that you mentioned I

1675.82 --> 1681.97
and silly yeah I watched stripes again

1679.119 --> 1684.4889999999998
my god that movie is so silly

1681.97 --> 1688.33
but it kind of reminds me of that yeah

1684.489 --> 1690.519
the wiseass guy and then the sergeant

1688.33 --> 1694.259
and then that time where he's basically

1690.519 --> 1698.249
saying Oh take punch take a punch at me

1694.259 --> 1700.629
yeah that was a complete waste of energy

1698.249 --> 1706.2
from that guy who got punched in the

1700.629 --> 1706.1999999999998
stomach so

1707.76 --> 1715.59
but after that point he didn't stop

1710.35 --> 1719.53
being a wiseass against him though so I

1715.59 --> 1722.1999999999998
did I I thought it was very interesting

1719.53 --> 1729.91
or all put together and also like the

1722.2 --> 1733.75
sergeant like they didn't like really

1729.91 --> 1735.88
make him into an idiot no he was

1733.75 --> 1739.78
actually just a very serious military

1735.88 --> 1742.24
guy and quite competent really he just

1739.78 --> 1745.21
got some idiotic bad luck from that

1742.24 --> 1747.4
other doofus who was hilarious by the

1745.21 --> 1752.05
way especially at that time when he was

1747.4 --> 1754.27
looking through through a telescope at

1752.05 --> 1756.52
these naked girls showering and then the

1754.27 --> 1758.98
other sergeant comes in and runs it

1756.52 --> 1764.02
through the window that was so freaky I

1758.98 --> 1766.99
left my ass off Oh God that movie is

1764.02 --> 1770.25
just so silly the whole premise of that

1766.99 --> 1774.97
super special bus is just ridiculous

1770.25 --> 1777.19
doesn't work because as soon as it's as

1774.97 --> 1781.42
soon as it's revealed like yeah and any

1777.19 --> 1785.14
kind of reproduction is immediately

1781.42 --> 1792.0
known so it's just silly but it was a

1785.14 --> 1792.0
funny movie oh very goofy anyway

1806.92 --> 1813.76
what do I do for work don't you know

1809.38 --> 1816.7
that I do this spend a lot of time on

1813.76 --> 1822.929
the debate scenes and I'm basically a

1816.7 --> 1826.48
layman scientist doing study for free

1822.929 --> 1829.51
right yeah and other than that I'm on

1826.48 --> 1832.75
social welfare and I do have a couple of

1829.51 --> 1837.91
side jobs on that but they're not even

1832.75 --> 1841.45
enough to get out of it so yeah and that

1837.91 --> 1845.5800000000002
is also why I ask for financial support

1841.45 --> 1849.07
it's kind of unusual but I'm literally

1845.58 --> 1853.299
dedicating everything I got to this

1849.07 --> 1855.82
everything I got because I think I can

1853.299 --> 1857.8899999999999
do a lot of good but at the same time

1855.82 --> 1859.99
yeah I'm not financially stable I've

1857.89 --> 1862.929
been very open and clear and honest

1859.99 --> 1867.19
about is also that I'm not proud of it

1862.929 --> 1871.45
it's because of yeah big mistakes I made

1867.19 --> 1874.9
in earlier in life that kind of changed

1871.45 --> 1877.299
me in a way that I now regret was

1874.9 --> 1881.679
foolish of me as [ __ ] but it is what it

1877.299 --> 1884.11
is and hey if I want to get out I've

1881.679 --> 1887.5300000000002
been trying to get out of this financial

1884.11 --> 1889.99
predicament even before I did the early

1887.53 --> 1892.1789999999999
bird show and I did have a couple of

1889.99 --> 1895.059
jobs but it just didn't really work this

1892.179 --> 1899.3500000000001
just I don't have the background it's

1895.059 --> 1904.299
not working it's too many papers needed

1899.35 --> 1906.58
everywhere and yeah so I'm just doing

1904.299 --> 1909.8799999999999
this but I do need financial support

1906.58 --> 1911.77
it's so annoying and in a way I wish

1909.88 --> 1913.63
that instead I could have basically sell

1911.77 --> 1919.059
products that would be a little bit more

1913.63 --> 1922.48
gracious I guess but yeah I don't have

1919.059 --> 1924.25
the capacity at the time although I yeah

1922.48 --> 1926.95
for the long run I do have ideas and

1924.25 --> 1930.49
also because I am pretty much doubling

1926.95 --> 1932.1100000000001
down on doing this I also realized okay

1930.49 --> 1935.32
I have to get more professional I really

1932.11 --> 1937.28
have to push myself to expand and kind

1935.32 --> 1941.1799999999998
of do build things on top of

1937.28 --> 1946.28
kind of like Nathan has though not in

1941.18 --> 1949.66
the way he does but in the meantime I

1946.28 --> 1953.0
still have to get by so sorry about that

1949.66 --> 1957.3200000000002
but I really do need it like kind of

1953.0 --> 1958.94
right now or I'm gonna have to pull some

1957.32 --> 1960.74
strings again and see if there's

1958.94 --> 1971.96
anything left or if I'm gonna get an

1960.74 --> 1974.3
envelope my head yeah because I have to

1971.96 --> 1976.6000000000001
hold out in some way at least another

1974.3 --> 1976.6
week

1978.65 --> 1981.8190000000002
[Music]

1986.81 --> 1989.3799999999999
Wow

1993.44 --> 1998.96
so you think all of this is silly Fiona

1996.14 --> 2005.6200000000001
James you think it is silly I'm all just

1998.96 --> 2008.95
wasting my time that that's seriously

2005.62 --> 2011.59
insulting so you think that well for

2008.95 --> 2014.38
example my research in light and the

2011.59 --> 2016.84
nature of matter and figuring out the

2014.38 --> 2018.96
aberration of gravity and the potential

2016.84 --> 2021.76
new arriving Arab eration

2018.96 --> 2024.07
realization of the ether although it

2021.76 --> 2028.21
could turn out not to be but it just

2024.07 --> 2031.32
seems preliminary ly for a while like it

2028.21 --> 2033.58
is just like gravity another aberration

2031.32 --> 2037.36
doesn't mean that there isn't more to

2033.58 --> 2041.6499999999999
figure out you know we have figured out

2037.36 --> 2043.8899999999999
what is basically behind gravity all the

2041.65 --> 2046.6000000000001
elements what causes them in a way

2043.89 --> 2049.21
relative density and there's still some

2046.6 --> 2053.77
mysteries why the alignment why up and

2049.21 --> 2058.83
down but yeah there's just no way to at

2053.77 --> 2061.09
this point even test anything about that

2058.83 --> 2064.929
really it's just all gonna be

2061.09 --> 2067.179
presuppositional ideals concepts but

2064.929 --> 2069.1600000000003
yeah I do figure out a lot

2067.179 --> 2071.919
because I spent time because I talk

2069.16 --> 2076.3599999999997
about it because ideas pop into my head

2071.919 --> 2083.41
because I spent all this time and energy

2076.36 --> 2085.36
I take my research very seriously and I

2083.41 --> 2087.97
think that I'm potentially learning more

2085.36 --> 2090.3700000000003
here than I would even if I'd had gone

2087.97 --> 2093.1899999999996
to a university because then I would try

2090.37 --> 2096.6099999999997
to memorize stuff but it wouldn't have

2093.19 --> 2099.13
the proper context in order to stick for

2096.61 --> 2102.28
me so then I'd know some structures but

2099.13 --> 2105.46
they would probably mostly fade away as

2102.28 --> 2108.9700000000003
most really to be honest what I learned

2105.46 --> 2113.35
in school most of it has faded away but

2108.97 --> 2118.7999999999997
if I could find a proper framework

2113.35 --> 2121.45
between it all then an extract a derived

2118.8 --> 2123.52
extract component will still remain in

2121.45 --> 2125.0499999999997
my memory and then it's only a matter of

2123.52 --> 2126.43
just looking back at it

2125.05 --> 2132.42
looking it up and they're remembering

2126.43 --> 2135.97
again but I am learning so much from

2132.42 --> 2140.11
doing this so that's why I'm asking

2135.97 --> 2143.3199999999997
please please if you got anything you

2140.11 --> 2151.02
know just just five bucks to PayPal or

2143.32 --> 2151.02
something anything it will matter a lot

2151.74 --> 2158.3399999999997
[Music]

2161.21 --> 2167.46
anyway enough with the bagging I'd only

2165.299 --> 2177.019
do it because I because I have no choice

2167.46 --> 2177.0190000000002
but yeah I gotta get around somehow

2177.47 --> 2185.839
thank you the studio 68 for the ten

2180.809 --> 2185.8390000000004
Australian dollars much appreciated

2200.73 --> 2203.21
right

2205.15 --> 2212.2000000000003
but yeah just remember I'm specifically

2208.72 --> 2214.3289999999997
addressing PayPal because that money

2212.2 --> 2219.7
basically arrives one or two days later

2214.329 --> 2221.799
and super chats are cool but yeah they

2219.7 --> 2225.22
come in with the paycheck and that's

2221.799 --> 2230.529
usually after all the other money's

2225.22 --> 2233.2
already gotten in so and in this case

2230.529 --> 2235.45
it's really for the next week someone I

2233.2 --> 2241.839
have to get by in a way and I don't

2235.45 --> 2248.1299999999997
really know how I'm gonna try but thank

2241.839 --> 2248.13
you know on the long run it still helps

2252.78 --> 2265.15
yeah unorthodox exactly that that's also

2257.74 --> 2268.6299999999997
there yes okay well hey if your Globo

2265.15 --> 2271.87
and you feel you need to help us well

2268.63 --> 2275.44
that would be great you know it's not

2271.87 --> 2278.1099999999997
easy being a flat earther not because of

2275.44 --> 2283.78
mental problems or whatever but because

2278.11 --> 2286.08
society just not not willing to be as

2283.78 --> 2286.0800000000004
helpful

2293.04 --> 2296.39
that's not funny

2300.78 --> 2308.07
yes Marceline I have but it wouldn't

2305.28 --> 2311.9700000000003
help a part-time job is not gonna get me

2308.07 --> 2315.51
out of the Social Welfare minimum that's

2311.97 --> 2317.6699999999996
the problem so yeah I can do that

2315.51 --> 2323.7900000000004
what it's gonna effectively do is cost

2317.67 --> 2327.12
more time cost more energy and not

2323.79 --> 2330.54
actually give me more money and then I

2327.12 --> 2333.96
have a choice to make either I just do

2330.54 --> 2336.48
it because I'm training myself or

2333.96 --> 2339.93
whatever or I have to move on to

2336.48 --> 2342.63
full-time to make it worth it and then

2339.93 --> 2344.91
it's just done then I have no more time

2342.63 --> 2347.37
and I'll probably not have a lot of

2344.91 --> 2350.3399999999997
energy left to do anything except maybe

2347.37 --> 2354.39
a few comments in chat every now and

2350.34 --> 2356.2200000000003
then that's just a reality of it because

2354.39 --> 2362.6099999999997
in the past when I did jobs it would

2356.22 --> 2366.45
absolutely drain me big time especially

2362.61 --> 2369.77
because I'm not used to it to really

2366.45 --> 2369.77
working around the clock like that

2374.0 --> 2379.38
all right yeah

2376.34 --> 2381.8700000000003
unorthodox hey if you get if you have

2379.38 --> 2384.83
patreon I have a patreon I could

2381.87 --> 2387.48
definitely use your support over there

2384.83 --> 2390.86
people want to donate to patreon and not

2387.48 --> 2394.56
use paypal then that's great

2390.86 --> 2398.4
well Conoco ala patreon is different

2394.56 --> 2401.67
from PayPal but my patreon for words its

2398.4 --> 2406.04
donation to my paypal effectively the

2401.67 --> 2412.53
patreon is just a platform where you can

2406.04 --> 2416.7
give regular donations like monthly it's

2412.53 --> 2419.0600000000004
I can automate a donation system PayPal

2416.7 --> 2422.2999999999997
is basically just the internet bank

2419.06 --> 2422.2999999999997
that's it

2442.94 --> 2449.75
and Lori whatever you want man but I'm

2447.769 --> 2451.3089999999997
just saying hey if you really like this

2449.75 --> 2453.109
show and you're like being a chattin you

2451.309 --> 2456.38
like asking me questions and getting

2453.109 --> 2460.16
answers and hearing updates and what

2456.38 --> 2463.099
I've been doing in my views then yeah I

2460.16 --> 2466.5389999999998
do need the nation's I'm so sorry I'm

2463.099 --> 2466.539
keeping on harping about this

2479.04 --> 2484.22
yes the studio 68 that's right

2486.45 --> 2489.6499999999996
[Music]

2492.5 --> 2495.61
[Music]

2506.86 --> 2512.6800000000003
uh George Sanford yeah that video from a

2510.4 --> 2515.32
while back I think I've seen that even a

2512.68 --> 2517.66
longer time ago it's interesting but it

2515.32 --> 2526.84
yeah don't doesn't mean a lot to me

2517.66 --> 2529.87
really yes screw you an orthodox what'd

2526.84 --> 2531.82
you just give it up just stop talking

2529.87 --> 2533.29
about Flat Earth say uh you know what I

2531.82 --> 2536.98
was wrong

2533.29 --> 2539.77
there's just useless or whatever reason

2536.98 --> 2543.82
and then go out yeah well screw it oh

2539.77 --> 2545.91
I'm just gonna give it all up and do

2543.82 --> 2548.32
whatever is necessary and become

2545.91 --> 2550.33
obsessed with rank and money and all

2548.32 --> 2555.13
that [ __ ] and just go along to get along

2550.33 --> 2558.24
until yeah when they look in the mirror

2555.13 --> 2565.03
I don't even know who I am anymore right

2558.24 --> 2568.0499999999997
that what you like more no no now

2565.03 --> 2568.05
there's no backing down

2575.29 --> 2581.65
now it's not funny in Orthodox you think

2578.92 --> 2584.25
it's funny to live like this to

2581.65 --> 2589.5
constantly have financial worries and

2584.25 --> 2593.47
basically beg friends and even my dad

2589.5 --> 2596.95
doesn't have anything right now because

2593.47 --> 2600.25
he there's yeah he's not all sad or

2596.95 --> 2603.22
anything you know and so you think

2600.25 --> 2607.27
that's funny to me no it's not

2603.22 --> 2610.54
to be fair I can barely contain my

2607.27 --> 2613.24
financial phobia which has dramatically

2610.54 --> 2615.43
decreased though since the seven chakras

2613.24 --> 2620.3399999999997
kicked back in 15 December I'm noticing

2615.43 --> 2620.3399999999997
that but yeah the situation is there

2635.39 --> 2642.31
Thank You crankiest for ztm I appreciate

2640.28 --> 2642.3100000000004
that

2660.99 --> 2665.7599999999998
well unorthodox maybe I'm just not

2663.839 --> 2666.24
really in the mood for your joke right

2665.76 --> 2669.23
now

2666.24 --> 2669.2299999999996
never thought about that

2677.78 --> 2682.57
but yeah whatever it's all good

2715.09 --> 2720.88
well mother Salim you back to different

2718.51 --> 2725.7400000000002
no you're pretty much in agreeance and I

2720.88 --> 2730.6
said I just explained it all you know

2725.74 --> 2732.3399999999997
what the hell I explained yes in a way

2730.6 --> 2736.74
in the past I made some really bad

2732.34 --> 2740.6200000000003
decisions but now I'm left with this gap

2736.74 --> 2743.49
and while I've built up all this

2740.62 --> 2748.18
knowledge and the faculties and all that

2743.49 --> 2750.0699999999997
anywhere I'm gonna go with jobs that are

2748.18 --> 2754.0299999999997
kind of more available because there's

2750.07 --> 2757.57
not that many around ok they will not

2754.03 --> 2760.84
allow me to basically apply myself

2757.57 --> 2764.44
none of them we're all going to force me

2760.84 --> 2767.92
in some kind of pattern that's really

2764.44 --> 2769.84
unnatural that wastes my energy and my

2767.92 --> 2775.14
skill and forces me to do with and

2769.84 --> 2779.6200000000003
things that seem contrary intuitive bad

2775.14 --> 2781.8599999999997
but that's just what happens but a lot

2779.62 --> 2781.8599999999997
of them

2781.95 --> 2787.799
and yeah self-inflicted well because I

2785.46 --> 2790.109
stepped away early and if I hadn't if I

2787.799 --> 2793.64
just forced myself to let myself get

2790.109 --> 2796.47
enslaved by that just cut over it

2793.64 --> 2799.17
earlier the earlier age well then I'd

2796.47 --> 2802.1699999999996
have a basic career to refer back to it

2799.17 --> 2804.63
and then every time I brought up my my

2802.17 --> 2807.27
paper anyone who's going to look at that

2804.63 --> 2809.1600000000003
isn't gonna say like hmm what the hell

2807.27 --> 2812.64
has he really been doing all that time

2809.16 --> 2815.46
and get doubts no matter what and then

2812.64 --> 2817.73
just discard it for somebody that has 20

2815.46 --> 2821.2400000000002
years experience or whatever you know

2817.73 --> 2821.2400000000002
that happens

2830.329 --> 2837.1890000000003
now I've talked about wasting energy and

2832.939 --> 2840.189
time in the jobs that I could get

2837.189 --> 2840.189
Marceline

2843.84 --> 2850.11
so hey if you could point out a job that

2847.02 --> 2852.78
would be fitting to me and my skills and

2850.11 --> 2855.1800000000003
what I could do and that wouldn't just

2852.78 --> 2858.8700000000003
force me to follow the beast system in

2855.18 --> 2862.77
some terrible terrible way staining my

2858.87 --> 2866.0699999999997
intellect and my my honesty in what I

2862.77 --> 2869.22
have to say to people like a regular

2866.07 --> 2871.23
teacher or whatever then by all means

2869.22 --> 2874.4399999999996
please tell me what it is and tell me

2871.23 --> 2875.91
how to get it and hey yeah there are

2874.44 --> 2878.2200000000003
some interesting stuff out there guess

2875.91 --> 2880.2599999999998
what you need papers for that a lot of

2878.22 --> 2883.77
them and study and money to get there

2880.26 --> 2889.0200000000004
yeah all of it it's always the bump I

2883.77 --> 2891.27
ran into every time yeah that's really

2889.02 --> 2894.42
nice unorthodox are you gonna pay for my

2891.27 --> 2896.46
study to become an engineer because I

2894.42 --> 2899.37
can't get any more funds for that and

2896.46 --> 2900.9
even if I could yeah I'd have to pay it

2899.37 --> 2903.27
back so it's not gonna work it's just

2900.9 --> 2905.28
not gonna work that's the problem

2903.27 --> 2907.14
because I screwed up when I was young

2905.28 --> 2910.92
and I could have gotten it right

2907.14 --> 2913.35
and I didn't and I'm screwed at it now I

2910.92 --> 2918.5
have to figure it all up from the bottom

2913.35 --> 2918.5
up live like this

2918.65 --> 2924.06
and if I want to force myself afterward

2922.08 --> 2926.73
well it's gonna take up everything I got

2924.06 --> 2931.44
everything including my mind and my

2926.73 --> 2933.63
heart not gonna have anything left if I

2931.44 --> 2937.1
want to do it like that it's been uh

2933.63 --> 2939.84
--then gonna be left I'm gonna be so

2937.1 --> 2943.23
shocked constantly and disappointed and

2939.84 --> 2945.36
just panicky because of the constant

2943.23 --> 2946.89
[ __ ] that you have to go through when

2945.36 --> 2948.84
things started when you suddenly get

2946.89 --> 2950.43
fired because oh it's just not

2948.84 --> 2951.96
convenient to hire your longer than a

2950.43 --> 2954.21
month and then I have to instantly get

2951.96 --> 2958.14
another job and go through all of that

2954.21 --> 2961.32
again and again and again and again and

2958.14 --> 2964.3799999999997
again and then I'm lucky if I if I hold

2961.32 --> 2967.44
that up after a year I'm not gonna

2964.38 --> 2970.35
basically split my head up and banging

2967.44 --> 2972.15
it against the wall because I got such a

2970.35 --> 2973.0699999999997
freakin headache and I'm sick of

2972.15 --> 2976.76
everything

2973.07 --> 2978.17
I tried it's sort of before well I

2976.76 --> 2981.71
didn't bang my head against the wall

2978.17 --> 2985.64
like that I did such elaborate job

2981.71 --> 2989.45
search it like took me a year did so

2985.64 --> 2991.6099999999997
many letters so many angles to it like

2989.45 --> 2995.12
talked with it about people about how to

2991.61 --> 2998.8700000000003
do it another approach with anything a

2995.12 --> 3003.7599999999998
year I didn't get a single freaking call

2998.87 --> 3005.7999999999997
back except one and it was yeah I went

3003.76 --> 3009.25
there and it didn't fit and I collapsed

3005.8 --> 3011.8
I collapsed from the stress literally

3009.25 --> 3014.53
broke out in tears how about that yeah

3011.8 --> 3020.9100000000003
it's great it's great looking for jobs

3014.53 --> 3025.7400000000002
lovely lovely way to go and sing so yeah

3020.91 --> 3025.74
that's my experience it sucks

3030.6 --> 3035.91
and I can't take it or I haven't been

3033.81 --> 3040.95
able to take it who knows maybe now it's

3035.91 --> 3042.75
just I don't know I don't know my

3040.95 --> 3045.06
capacity is you really anymore because

3042.75 --> 3049.8
since the 15 things have changed I could

3045.06 --> 3053.31
try it just can't say I'd be happy about

3049.8 --> 3055.59
it like even if I consider really doing

3053.31 --> 3057.36
that I'd be just pissed off against the

3055.59 --> 3059.8500000000004
world at the first place that I would be

3057.36 --> 3061.92
in some way feeling forced to do that

3059.85 --> 3064.14
because I want to do this I want to do

3061.92 --> 3067.89
this and I want to get financially by is

3064.14 --> 3075.29
that so tough to ask for is that so

3067.89 --> 3075.29
tough is that unreasonable

3085.75 --> 3090.429
[Music]

3103.32 --> 3108.21
now I'm not talking myself out of trying

3105.99 --> 3113.43
I'm just very well aware of the

3108.21 --> 3115.68
consequence and it's not to an appealing

3113.43 --> 3118.1699999999996
choice to me at this point because I

3115.68 --> 3121.5299999999997
want to continue this I'm gonna keep on

3118.17 --> 3123.92
doing this it's not gonna happen if I do

3121.53 --> 3123.92
that

3127.95 --> 3133.1699999999996
you think that's just something I say to

3130.799 --> 3135.589
sabotage myself now it's because I know

3133.17 --> 3135.589
myself

3146.12 --> 3153.8599999999997
do I make anything out of this well it

3150.11 --> 3155.78
helps me get by a little look if I

3153.86 --> 3157.9100000000003
didn't do it I still wouldn't

3155.78 --> 3160.6400000000003
financially get by unless I got that

3157.91 --> 3165.23
tried go for it for a job big time

3160.64 --> 3167.89
whatever right but what I get out of

3165.23 --> 3172.28
this is that I am getting myself

3167.89 --> 3176.77
educated very detailed about a lot of

3172.28 --> 3176.77
things that who knows when I can use it

3186.86 --> 3192.4300000000003
but yeah

3188.96 --> 3192.43
that's what I get out of it

3201.34 --> 3207.52
right yeah YouTube I know hey if they do

3205.69 --> 3213.9700000000003
that and I will migrate to another

3207.52 --> 3217.36
platform and I will still be asking for

3213.97 --> 3221.97
a PayPal donations then and hope to be

3217.36 --> 3224.8900000000003
getting them because yeah I already said

3221.97 --> 3226.5099999999998
even with all the super jet down Asians

3224.89 --> 3227.8599999999997
and everything in the income I get from

3226.51 --> 3231.67
Google they just take it out of my

3227.86 --> 3235.9300000000003
social welfare almost all of it just

3231.67 --> 3238.2400000000002
almost almost everything barely anything

3235.93 --> 3240.16
left of it and that means the

3238.24 --> 3243.0099999999998
advertisement donations that means the

3240.16 --> 3246.43
super chat donations the advertisement

3243.01 --> 3250.0200000000004
money so that's just that's just what it

3246.43 --> 3254.2599999999998
is it unfortunately is what it is

3250.02 --> 3261.16
that's why PayPal and patreon even

3254.26 --> 3264.1600000000003
GoFundMe works much much better but hey

3261.16 --> 3267.46
would I ever get in some way out of my

3264.16 --> 3270.64
financial read situation and I would

3267.46 --> 3273.04
have my own income then it would be a

3270.64 --> 3275.5
different game then any income from

3273.04 --> 3277.93
Google would literally add on to it but

3275.5 --> 3281.44
because I am in the red I am relying on

3277.93 --> 3284.71
social welfare it's literally just it's

3281.44 --> 3287.14
like a in every two week loan that I got

3284.71 --> 3290.08
a pay back so I get money at at some

3287.14 --> 3296.41
time extra but then it's gonna go back

3290.08 --> 3298.18
anyway so that's what it is you'd love

3296.41 --> 3300.2799999999997
to talk to me in person well that's fine

3298.18 --> 3302.91
if you want to talk to me in person then

3300.28 --> 3302.9100000000003
add me on skype

3334.67 --> 3337.33
did

3341.95 --> 3344.46
yes

3347.34 --> 3350.34
right

3367.42 --> 3378.76
I'm not in Amsterdam happy Kim Amsterdam

3374.71 --> 3382.42
and there's look you think there's any

3378.76 --> 3389.59
room in the cannabis business no there's

3382.42 --> 3392.53
not that market is saturated as it can

3389.59 --> 3396.34
get and they're all groups all

3392.53 --> 3398.8300000000004
safeguarding their own very careful

3396.34 --> 3402.73
there's no way I could get a job there

3398.83 --> 3405.31
and hey you know I'm good I read

3402.73 --> 3407.86
cannabis plants but you gotta have a

3405.31 --> 3410.14
garden for it I don't I'm not in the

3407.86 --> 3413.35
position to do any of it so yeah there

3410.14 --> 3416.5899999999997
is so much I could potentially do

3413.35 --> 3421.0899999999997
if only I'd get out of this financial

3416.59 --> 3423.28
read yeah I know that's great so love to

3421.09 --> 3424.9300000000003
just be reminded about all look at

3423.28 --> 3428.0400000000004
what's all out there out of reach yeah

3424.93 --> 3428.04
that's just freaking great

3433.07 --> 3437.369
[Music]

3442.74 --> 3446.1699999999996
[Music]

3446.66 --> 3451.3089999999997
oh right yeah that's another one tiny

3450.289 --> 3455.9900000000002
bumble yeah

3451.309 --> 3458.0890000000004
well it's because the Netherlands is

3455.99 --> 3465.5
just completely saturated with

3458.089 --> 3469.009
Goldsmith's it's totally saturated and I

3465.5 --> 3471.95
have tried I've actually applied for

3469.009 --> 3477.71
jobs at that part as well couldn't

3471.95 --> 3479.839
couldn't get it but who knows I might

3477.71 --> 3481.43
try again but then again it's been such

3479.839 --> 3485.619
a long time now that it had some real

3481.43 --> 3490.0389999999998
experience it's like five years ago alas

3485.619 --> 3494.75
you know and I I am good at what I

3490.039 --> 3497.2400000000002
learned for a detail but then again yeah

3494.75 --> 3499.24
I'm not really super up-to-date even

3497.24 --> 3501.7099999999996
with all the possibilities I've never

3499.24 --> 3506.45
there's so many things I have never even

3501.71 --> 3508.19
done as a goldsmith I don't know I I

3506.45 --> 3510.3489999999997
guess on average I would have a little

3508.19 --> 3513.38
bit more of a chance since I do have a

3510.349 --> 3515.2690000000002
lot of experience concerning that but

3513.38 --> 3518.75
still it's good it would be very tough

3515.269 --> 3525.2299999999996
but who knows maybe maybe it is worth a

3518.75 --> 3528.039
shot to try that specifically yeah as a

3525.23 --> 3531.41
goldsmith you're very much going to be

3528.039 --> 3533.75
relying mostly on your own devices and

3531.41 --> 3537.2
not so much on some social nonsense

3533.75 --> 3541.16
so yeah maybe maybe it's worth trying

3537.2 --> 3543.6699999999996
are looking out there yeah I'll make a

3541.16 --> 3543.67
note of it

3546.72 --> 3552.7799999999997
yeah because also with goldsmithing it

3549.43 --> 3555.85
can just be very different it's more

3552.78 --> 3560.02
usually more assignment based not so

3555.85 --> 3561.91
much a nine-to-five job situation

3560.02 --> 3565.38
sometimes I don't know it all depends

3561.91 --> 3565.3799999999997
I'll try looking around

3576.019 --> 3581.0989999999997
yeah but that does that's that's very

3579.029 --> 3583.049
specifically to be Cleary that's not

3581.099 --> 3587.339
gonna mean that I'm suddenly gonna have

3583.049 --> 3588.99
a goldsmith business where I'm gonna do

3587.339 --> 3593.19
things now that means that I'll be

3588.99 --> 3595.589
working for someone else and doing what

3593.19 --> 3601.98
they assign me to do that's what that

3595.589 --> 3608.609
means or who knows maybe it could even

3601.98 --> 3610.17
have like a a an assignment based kind

3608.609 --> 3613.109
of relation like oh you're a goldsmith

3610.17 --> 3614.91
okay we have a lot of assignments are

3613.109 --> 3616.499
you willing to take this assignment for

3614.91 --> 3619.95
I don't know what's that wow it works

3616.499 --> 3622.6499999999996
we'll find out I guess now I've never

3619.95 --> 3627.0589999999997
had officially a job as a goldsmith no I

3622.65 --> 3630.059
just worked as a goldsmith for myself

3627.059 --> 3632.8190000000004
and I did do things with that I've never

3630.059 --> 3644.579
worked for somebody else at it who knows

3632.819 --> 3646.619
I guess I'll try or I could get some

3644.579 --> 3650.96
more support from you guys and it'd

3646.619 --> 3650.96
probably just keep on going doing this

3693.079 --> 3697.63
weights Underwood's are you saying that

3695.269 --> 3697.6299999999997
to me

3706.45 --> 3710.73
wait you're talking to Douglas

3728.29 --> 3734.52
this expert in stuffing your face - what

3732.31 --> 3734.52

3737.82 --> 3740.929
[Music]

3744.089 --> 3750.8289999999997
don't go there Tom Parker come on don't

3748.5 --> 3750.829
do that

3759.82 --> 3768.6600000000003
and I'm pretty sure that big jungus is

3765.34 --> 3768.6600000000003
not P Mars

3778.809 --> 3784.9
whoo hey a freak em sounds lovely how's

3783.069 --> 3793.5589999999997
that actually gonna help me get an

3784.9 --> 3793.559
income because then I'd need a a place

3794.039 --> 3803.1090000000004
it's a lovely idea I thought about it

3797.4 --> 3805.029
but yeah how's that gonna help my

3803.109 --> 3809.969
situation it's probably gonna help the

3805.029 --> 3809.969
cafe though if they accept that

3830.39 --> 3833.54
[Music]

3836.77 --> 3843.42
hmm

3838.95 --> 3845.3689999999997
yeah unicorn Slayer well that was kind

3843.42 --> 3848.42
of my setup as well as a goldsmith

3845.369 --> 3851.039
because I just do the work on myself I

3848.42 --> 3852.4500000000003
only have to get materials every now and

3851.039 --> 3855.2690000000002
then and it just do everything myself

3852.45 --> 3858.029
and then hey if somebody's interested a

3855.269 --> 3858.8289999999997
customer then I went over there that's

3858.029 --> 3861.65
it

3858.829 --> 3866.069
but I didn't really mingle with other

3861.65 --> 3869.21
others of my profession a lot except

3866.069 --> 3871.769
well except for this girl

3869.21 --> 3876.299
but that was not for professional

3871.769 --> 3878.5989999999997
reasons I was very honest about that too

3876.299 --> 3878.599
by the way

3905.41 --> 3913.24
right anyway I think I'm gonna round out

3908.41 --> 3915.8199999999997
the show sixty five minutes and then I

3913.24 --> 3918.72
got a flutter at the bed the Flat Earth

thanks everyone for coming I hope you

3922.3 --> 3927.88

3924.91 --> 3932.56

3932.56 --> 3939.07
