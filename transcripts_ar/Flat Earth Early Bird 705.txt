uh yeah starting a little early today as

81.04 --> 85.52000000000001
promised on

82.0 --> 87.2
yesterday's test stream because i

85.52 --> 91.19999999999999
didn't have a show yesterday because of

87.2 --> 91.2
technical difficulties as i explained

92.4 --> 96.32000000000001
and i said i would start or i would go a

94.799 --> 98.56
little longer because i thought it was

96.32 --> 100.079
friday for some reason well actually now

98.56 --> 102.99000000000001
it's friday

100.079 --> 104.55999999999999
so i'm instead starting a little earlier

102.99 --> 108.32
[Music]

104.56 --> 111.52
audio please what is with the audio

108.32 --> 111.52
audio issues what

112.0 --> 117.36
are you guys not hearing me

115.119 --> 119.84
are you guys not hearing me well i am

117.36 --> 119.84
hearing me

119.97 --> 126.84
[Music]

122.399 --> 129.84
whatever um right

126.84 --> 129.84
so

131.44 --> 134.8
i got green tea with me

137.76 --> 141.44
but yeah what happened yesterday was the

139.92 --> 143.44
the interface

141.44 --> 144.56
which i normally use to basically start

143.44 --> 146.64
up a hangout

144.56 --> 148.8
from of youtube it was just gone gave me

146.64 --> 152.16
a blank page very confusing got me

148.8 --> 153.92000000000002
totally flustered and i thank nathan for

152.16 --> 155.519
his patience because he called me on the

153.92 --> 157.28
skype call but because i was so

155.519 --> 158.959
flustered he was just trying to point me

157.28 --> 162.0
and i was basically panicking

158.959 --> 164.0
kind of embarrassing but yeah that

162.0 --> 165.519
happens with me unfortunately but i

164.0 --> 168.08
thank him for

165.519 --> 168.8
bearing with me and pointing out exactly

168.08 --> 172.64000000000001
how

168.8 --> 175.28
i should instead find that same page

172.64 --> 176.07999999999998
and yeah it worked eventually but it was

175.28 --> 178.0
so late that

176.08 --> 181.12
it wasn't really worth starting up a

178.0 --> 184.72
stream at that point

181.12 --> 188.0
anyway right

184.72 --> 191.35999999999999
hello let's see who's in chat so far

188.0 --> 191.36
brend m was first

191.44 --> 202.56
santos russian whatever good servant

196.84 --> 202.56
ajm yeah good to see you all so far

202.8 --> 205.76000000000002
on this friday

212.08 --> 215.59900000000002
it was a little typical though that

213.92 --> 217.67999999999998
because i don't know on wednesday i

215.599 --> 218.64
think i was bragging towards a baller at

217.68 --> 221.04000000000002
some point that

218.64 --> 222.55999999999997
i have a stream every single day no

221.04 --> 224.48
exception and then

222.56 --> 227.519
the next day my stream is cancelled due

224.48 --> 229.51899999999998
to technical difficulties it is

227.519 --> 231.12
it's like a little pointer of god i see

229.519 --> 235.92000000000002
it like that like yeah

231.12 --> 235.92000000000002
yeah don't don't brag don't brag

236.0 --> 241.439
shouldn't even though i am proud of yeah

239.76 --> 243.599
what i've accomplished so far and at the

241.439 --> 245.76
same time it was really tough to

243.599 --> 248.56
basically

245.76 --> 248.56
attain that

249.36 --> 254.0
because i never had a really high

250.799 --> 258.639
opinion of myself naturally

254.0 --> 259.35
so but yeah i've got it under control

258.639 --> 262.48900000000003
right

259.35 --> 262.48900000000003
[Music]

263.919 --> 268.0
i did not make a long note list

266.84 --> 271.67999999999995
yesterday

268.0 --> 275.12
at all but i don't know

271.68 --> 278.40000000000003
i don't think there were too many

275.12 --> 281.68
very interesting streams for some reason

278.4 --> 282.15999999999997
or i missed them i could be but yeah the

281.68 --> 285.199
fv

282.16 --> 290.16
the flat earth debates was just epic

285.199 --> 293.28000000000003
long was one half hours extra

290.16 --> 295.28000000000003
pretty damn long and yeah with two

293.28 --> 300.23999999999995
ballers on there

295.28 --> 303.44
so that's gonna be very promising

300.24 --> 311.84000000000003
for saturday i think ah

303.44 --> 311.84
okay good to hear that santosh russian

314.93 --> 324.16
[Music]

320.4 --> 326.4
what was i doing

324.16 --> 328.16
yeah i remember i watched back a

326.4 --> 333.44
wednesday show

328.16 --> 335.84000000000003
yesterday watched it back completely

333.44 --> 337.84
and it was freaking good also was very

335.84 --> 338.88
telling that i only had one upvote on

337.84 --> 341.84
the thing

338.88 --> 343.68
displayed to me at least very typical

341.84 --> 347.59999999999997
because it was a very

343.68 --> 347.6
strong show with a lot of activity and

348.639 --> 352.96000000000004
and it was really well in my

350.72 --> 355.28000000000003
explanations and yeah it was really good

352.96 --> 357.35999999999996
hang out in retrospect

355.28 --> 359.84
definitely worth giving it a title

357.36 --> 362.319
because that's really what i do if i

359.84 --> 364.23999999999995
look i have so many shows now it's it's

362.319 --> 367.44
literally a chore

364.24 --> 369.68
to figure out a name for a show

367.44 --> 372.8
and somehow make it memorable and not

369.68 --> 375.68
just a random blurred out text

372.8 --> 376.96000000000004
that's been repeated endlessly you know

375.68 --> 379.039
so

376.96 --> 380.08
i really only designate names to my

379.039 --> 383.36
hangouts that

380.08 --> 385.68
i find particularly memorable

383.36 --> 387.91900000000004
and i use the title as an anchor point

385.68 --> 389.44
because it makes it easier to find

387.919 --> 391.28
when i'm browsing through it and then

389.44 --> 393.759
like oh yeah that that reminds me of

391.28 --> 397.28
that specific thing

393.759 --> 397.91900000000004
and that works for me now sometimes i

397.28 --> 400.23999999999995
give

397.919 --> 401.039
multiple hangouts names and sometimes i

400.24 --> 403.84000000000003
don't

401.039 --> 405.44
and when i don't it's usually because

403.84 --> 406.08
like there might have been good moments

405.44 --> 408.479
and then

406.08 --> 411.52
really bad moments or things that really

408.479 --> 413.919
have nothing to do with anything

411.52 --> 415.919
and then i just don't really feel like

413.919 --> 419.75899999999996
giving it a name

415.919 --> 422.15999999999997
anyway miserable wet week in the uk

419.759 --> 424.47900000000004
this week yeah agm with with me here in

422.16 --> 426.8
the netherlands as well

424.479 --> 428.88
on average and wednesday was too so

426.8 --> 430.479
terrible that yeah i actually skipped my

428.88 --> 433.68
newspaper rounds

430.479 --> 436.0
because of that it was so terrible it's

433.68 --> 438.08
like okay if i'm gonna go out there

436.0 --> 440.8
like every single newspaper i'm gonna

438.08 --> 440.8
put down the

441.44 --> 447.28
gonna deliver is gonna be pretty soaked

445.12 --> 448.84000000000003
probably damaged when i have to put it

447.28 --> 452.31899999999996
through the thing

448.84 --> 453.919
so yeah

452.319 --> 456.56
it was really shitty weather and just

453.919 --> 456.56
didn't stop

464.46 --> 469.28
[Music]

465.919 --> 469.28
uh no agm

470.879 --> 477.12
i don't know how long you know me but

474.24 --> 480.319
that is something i don't do i don't

477.12 --> 480.319
really care for that

480.4 --> 484.71999999999997
now it's fine if somebody else does it

482.879 --> 488.24
even here in chat as long as they don't

484.72 --> 490.47900000000004
spam my chat full with that stuff

488.24 --> 492.0
and then i'll address it for sure but i

490.479 --> 497.52
am not somebody that does

492.0 --> 497.52
that it's i work on what i work on

498.08 --> 501.68
and i know kind of what the bible is

500.24 --> 504.24
esoterically

501.68 --> 504.8
and i i trust on it and on the frequency

504.24 --> 508.0
and its

504.8 --> 508.24
influence in the world on the good side

508.0 --> 511.52
and

508.24 --> 511.84000000000003
on the bad side i understand this i'm

511.52 --> 513.519
not

511.84 --> 515.4399999999999
somebody that's going to read things and

513.519 --> 517.36
then highlight specific things

515.44 --> 518.8000000000001
even too much it's other there's plenty

517.36 --> 523.44
of people that

518.8 --> 523.4399999999999
made it their lives work to do that

523.839 --> 529.519
yeah i'm not one of those people sorry

526.72 --> 535.839
i'm not an exit terrorist

529.519 --> 540.8
it's just not my thing

535.839 --> 540.8000000000001
anyway huh

541.59 --> 544.799
[Music]

546.0 --> 550.72
yeah i know it's worth a try for you and

548.72 --> 552.399
hey if you have some specific bible

550.72 --> 553.76
verse and you think it's like super

552.399 --> 557.44
relevant or

553.76 --> 559.279
existential in its meaning in the moment

557.44 --> 560.8000000000001
then sure share it i have no problem

559.279 --> 563.8389999999999
with that as long as you don't

560.8 --> 565.8389999999999
start obsessing over cross-referencing

563.839 --> 567.0400000000001
every freaking thing that's going on

565.839 --> 568.8800000000001
with bible rep

567.04 --> 571.519
with bible verses because that's just

568.88 --> 576.24
that gets tedious pretty quick

571.519 --> 576.9590000000001
for me sorry you know that's that sort

576.24 --> 580.16
of thing is

576.959 --> 580.8
like over at paula's hangouts bible

580.16 --> 582.64
literally

580.8 --> 584.24
although i think you might be banned

582.64 --> 586.48
there i don't know aja

584.24 --> 590.5600000000001
but that's because you have trouble

586.48 --> 594.399
holding your tongue at times

590.56 --> 598.2399999999999
right ah hello mr jones

594.399 --> 600.0
yeah remember that i

598.24 --> 601.44
replied with my comment that i would

600.0 --> 606.32
remember

601.44 --> 606.32
what you said there i do yeah

607.12 --> 613.12
yeah you revealed yourself there buddy

610.48 --> 615.76
that was a really stupid thing to do to

613.12 --> 619.6
make such comments

615.76 --> 622.0
after after the careful

619.6 --> 623.36
relation we've been building here in

622.0 --> 626.079
chat

623.36 --> 628.16
with some mutual levels of respect and

626.079 --> 630.0
then you go and say that in my

628.16 --> 633.8389999999999
comment section you think that's just

630.0 --> 633.839
gonna slip me by

635.2 --> 647.839
so what do you have to say for yourself

636.8 --> 647.8389999999999
mister mr jones

649.04 --> 665.4399999999999
hello rob h

661.76 --> 665.4399999999999
um keep it spherical so

666.48 --> 672.0790000000001
it's okay to basically start

669.6 --> 672.64
breaking bonds of trust and shaming

672.079 --> 675.76
people

672.64 --> 677.279
behind their backs effectively probably

675.76 --> 680.88
to you

677.279 --> 681.68
in their space in my comment section

680.88 --> 683.6
that you know

681.68 --> 685.8389999999999
that you should know that i'm gonna see

683.6 --> 685.839
that

685.92 --> 694.079
so is is that keeping it spherical

690.88 --> 698.16
is that it is that your justification

694.079 --> 698.16
it's not a very good justification mr

700.839 --> 703.839
jones

703.92 --> 710.399
yeah i know it's public

707.04 --> 712.959
and i'm i'm trying to highlight

710.399 --> 714.839
yeah yeah with with this freedom comes a

712.959 --> 717.04
certain level of

714.839 --> 719.0400000000001
responsibility and

717.04 --> 720.8
you just proved in that comment section

719.04 --> 725.4399999999999
that you are not

720.8 --> 725.4399999999999
actually respecting me

726.32 --> 734.1600000000001
so in a really stupid

730.959 --> 738.399
way you know i'll just look it up

734.16 --> 738.399
and just read out what you put there

742.839 --> 748.24
right

745.519 --> 748.24
where was that

752.959 --> 758.88
703 oh no no no wait it was

757.04 --> 760.16
yeah yeah it was in the test stream i

758.88 --> 763.76
remember

760.16 --> 763.76
it's very silly thing of you to do

768.8 --> 776.56
right it's very silly thing to say

773.399 --> 778.24
704 early birds and you still don't know

776.56 --> 781.5999999999999
how to live stream

778.24 --> 787.839
it's very cute it's very cute that you

781.6 --> 787.839
would say that

802.24 --> 804.72
banter

806.079 --> 810.079
so it's just you're stupid you don't

808.88 --> 813.36
even know how to do

810.079 --> 815.279
something that that's banter to you is

813.36 --> 817.6
it is it mr jones

815.279 --> 818.48
is that how you banter with people do

817.6 --> 822.0
you do that

818.48 --> 824.0
everyone must be quite a hassle to go

822.0 --> 829.839
around

824.0 --> 829.839
and to get around for you

833.6 --> 838.32
oh really so what what what did you

836.959 --> 842.0
think

838.32 --> 844.0
it would imply then

842.0 --> 846.0
after so long are we indeed doesn't even

844.0 --> 848.8
know how to start up a live stream

846.0 --> 857.839
what does that imply does that imply

848.8 --> 857.8389999999999
that i'm competent

871.04 --> 876.959
right yeah yeah well i can

874.24 --> 877.92
read behind the line so yeah these

876.959 --> 881.8389999999999
backhanded

877.92 --> 883.36
types of yeah social shaming jokes

881.839 --> 885.0400000000001
i don't really appreciate them

883.36 --> 889.76
especially from somebody

885.04 --> 893.519
like yourself it's already kind of

889.76 --> 896.0
on the border of getting banned someday

893.519 --> 897.519
but you've managed to so far kind of

896.0 --> 901.199
behave

897.519 --> 904.399
civil enough to keep you around

901.199 --> 908.16
but yeah these sort of things yeah

904.399 --> 910.639
i pay attention you know i if you're

908.16 --> 911.36
if i'm going to tolerate you and your

910.639 --> 913.839
beliefs

911.36 --> 916.0790000000001
and the tenacity that comes with them i

913.839 --> 918.399
will uphold a certain standard

916.079 --> 920.88
i'm gonna be extremely strict i'm gonna

918.399 --> 922.959
be that [ __ ] up teacher

920.88 --> 924.16
that literally has eyes in their back of

922.959 --> 926.4799999999999
their head i know

924.16 --> 928.3199999999999
things about people that i pay attention

926.48 --> 932.32
to and they can't figure out how

928.32 --> 935.9200000000001
but i do that's the type of teacher i am

932.32 --> 939.6
and that's i will how i will do things

935.92 --> 943.5999999999999
here with ball believers

939.6 --> 946.88
and i very much focus on social behavior

943.6 --> 949.44
because i why do i do this because i

946.88 --> 952.16
want a world

949.44 --> 953.12
where flat earthers and ballers can have

952.16 --> 956.079
their beliefs

953.12 --> 957.519
and still have civil discussions learn

956.079 --> 961.04
how to do this

957.519 --> 963.6
with the friction of the the conflicting

961.04 --> 964.959
beliefs as it is seen it's very

963.6 --> 968.48
important to me

964.959 --> 971.3599999999999
because otherwise it'll yeah it could

968.48 --> 973.759
just cause too much chaos and then at

971.36 --> 975.04
some point maybe that freedom of speech

973.759 --> 977.279
might be taken away

975.04 --> 979.279
in some way and i don't want that i want

977.279 --> 981.279
it to stay open

979.279 --> 984.079
i believe there will always be baller

981.279 --> 986.16
believers no matter what

984.079 --> 987.519
even if there wasn't any school

986.16 --> 990.3199999999999
teachings of it

987.519 --> 991.279
like in the past i think they will still

990.32 --> 993.839
be there

991.279 --> 995.68
it would simply go more underground they

993.839 --> 996.0790000000001
would still be willing believers it's

995.68 --> 999.7589999999999
still

996.079 --> 1002.88
a designed thing taylor

999.759 --> 1005.279
made for the human mind so

1002.88 --> 1006.48
it will appeal even if you won't be

1005.279 --> 1010.639
taught about it

1006.48 --> 1014.16
in school as a kid see

1010.639 --> 1014.16
it will still be appealing

1014.24 --> 1019.6800000000001
to some uniquely more than

1017.36 --> 1021.1990000000001
some more than others but that's what i

1019.68 --> 1023.04
believe and i think it's extremely

1021.199 --> 1026.079
important that we all learn to

1023.04 --> 1029.199
deal with our beliefs and still live

1026.079 --> 1030.559
in a nice world where not everybody's

1029.199 --> 1032.319
constantly yelling at

1030.559 --> 1034.959
you each other like a bunch of demons or

1032.319 --> 1039.839
goblins it's it's [ __ ] up i don't want

1034.959 --> 1039.8390000000002
the world to be like that

1044.88 --> 1052.88
good mr jones glad you want that too

1050.4 --> 1054.48
if you really mean that then you gotta

1052.88 --> 1058.64
work at it

1054.48 --> 1058.64
no more backhanded comments

1059.919 --> 1065.2800000000002
unless unless you really want to say

1062.96 --> 1065.76
that as a joke and then if you think it

1065.28 --> 1068.32
might be

1065.76 --> 1068.8799999999999
interpreted as a backhanded comment then

1068.32 --> 1072.32
yeah

1068.88 --> 1074.96
put little tags disclaimer this is a

1072.32 --> 1076.1599999999999
joke this sounds really silly to do i do

1074.96 --> 1079.6000000000001
it sometimes too

1076.16 --> 1079.6000000000001
in certain comment sections

1079.679 --> 1086.16
because sometimes i i make pretty

1083.2 --> 1087.52
i try to be like on the yeah edge of

1086.16 --> 1090.48
triggering people

1087.52 --> 1092.6399999999999
with jokes but it could be interpreted

1090.48 --> 1094.96
as something really [ __ ] up

1092.64 --> 1097.1200000000001
then i have to just say this is a joke

1094.96 --> 1100.16
or if it's a very sensitive it might be

1097.12 --> 1104.3999999999999
sensitive to certain people that

1100.16 --> 1104.4
are more involved in it see it's just

1104.72 --> 1111.52
be careful with people's feelings

1108.16 --> 1114.48
if you feel that something might be

1111.52 --> 1116.799
tense in this situation that that's all

1114.48 --> 1116.799
right

1118.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
i don't agree with oakley then no no no

1121.44 --> 1126.88
no everything has a time and a place

1123.84 --> 1129.36
and what nathan oakley does is something

1126.88 --> 1132.64
else is what i'm doing

1129.36 --> 1134.24
look i'm more in the middle of the

1132.64 --> 1138.0800000000002
spectrum i'm

1134.24 --> 1140.08
dealing with flat earthers that

1138.08 --> 1142.1599999999999
are willing to deal with ballers and

1140.08 --> 1144.0
ballers that are willing to deal with

1142.16 --> 1147.3600000000001
flat earthers nathan

1144.0 --> 1150.559
is all the way to the top

1147.36 --> 1152.08
more with we really want to know

1150.559 --> 1154.48
we really want to figure out well i'm

1152.08 --> 1157.36
part of that too but also

1154.48 --> 1160.559
that unique really don't want to know

1157.36 --> 1163.52
the really super stubborn idiots

1160.559 --> 1164.0
the the the cream of the crop or yeah

1163.52 --> 1166.08
the

1164.0 --> 1168.32
the turd that floats to the top however

1166.08 --> 1170.1599999999999
you see it

1168.32 --> 1171.4399999999998
the ones that won't give up and then

1170.16 --> 1174.799
show that then

1171.44 --> 1178.0
show the actual conflict and also show

1174.799 --> 1181.6
like basically why you really don't

1178.0 --> 1184.24
want to go there why

1181.6 --> 1184.6399999999999
it'll just drive you nuts and it'll just

1184.24 --> 1187.52
be

1184.64 --> 1190.0
the most tenacious level of secret

1187.52 --> 1192.0
bullying back and forth in ways

1190.0 --> 1193.679
that you can ever imagine so it's kind

1192.0 --> 1197.52
of a showcase

1193.679 --> 1200.0800000000002
as a repellent to religious

1197.52 --> 1202.6399999999999
fanaticism and that is what i really

1200.08 --> 1206.559
like about the flat earth debates

1202.64 --> 1209.44
it's not my field although i can

1206.559 --> 1209.9189999999999
very much thrive with my expertise there

1209.44 --> 1212.159
and i

1209.919 --> 1213.76
love that aspect of it it's high energy

1212.159 --> 1218.0
and i like that

1213.76 --> 1220.48
but yes what nathan does is not my thing

1218.0 --> 1221.76
i can do it in certain rage win moments

1220.48 --> 1224.24
but it's not healthy

1221.76 --> 1226.96
and more importantly it's not helpful

1224.24 --> 1229.679
for me on the long run

1226.96 --> 1231.919
and the only reasons i even kind of

1229.679 --> 1234.48
pushed myself to show more of that

1231.919 --> 1237.919
is because i wanted to show what i do

1234.48 --> 1237.919
have in that i do have it

1238.0 --> 1246.559
it's like it's my bio defense mechanism

1242.559 --> 1249.28
like i'm a very civil guy and i love

1246.559 --> 1250.96
things i'm very sensitive but if you

1249.28 --> 1252.72
think that that means i'm weak and

1250.96 --> 1254.72
you're gonna [ __ ] with me well you're

1252.72 --> 1256.159
gonna see a monster you've never

1254.72 --> 1259.2
imagined

1256.159 --> 1263.3600000000001
maybe literally in your dreams

1259.2 --> 1266.48
because yeah when the tension grows high

1263.36 --> 1268.7199999999998
weird [ __ ] can happen

1266.48 --> 1268.72
so

1271.28 --> 1277.84
right so that's it

1280.96 --> 1287.2
irwin do you think the way nathan spoke

1283.36 --> 1290.799
on to the guy on his channel yesterday

1287.2 --> 1293.1200000000001
that's not a question

1290.799 --> 1293.12
what

1295.679 --> 1302.0
what do i think of the way nathan spoke

1298.799 --> 1302.0
to the guy yesterday on his channel

1302.84 --> 1308.3999999999999
uh

1305.12 --> 1309.84
it was a little confusing you see nathan

1308.4 --> 1312.2
is not perfect

1309.84 --> 1314.08
you have to remember nathan is a

1312.2 --> 1317.2
methodologist

1314.08 --> 1318.3999999999999
he's really the methodologist with the

1317.2 --> 1321.919
technicals that's

1318.4 --> 1325.1200000000001
his that's his his blade his

1321.919 --> 1325.5200000000002
sharpest this is his weapon it's what he

1325.12 --> 1328.559
does

1325.52 --> 1331.76
that's what he's good at and he can

1328.559 --> 1334.8799999999999
mistake certain things

1331.76 --> 1336.48
for a baller secretly

1334.88 --> 1338.24
acting trying to be something else

1336.48 --> 1339.84
because that happens a lot

1338.24 --> 1342.24
especially in the past there were just

1339.84 --> 1344.6399999999999
people trying to trick us

1342.24 --> 1345.76
trying to pretend they were something

1344.64 --> 1348.0
else first off

1345.76 --> 1349.84
in chat but all kinds of things so he's

1348.0 --> 1352.72
super sharp on the technicals and when

1349.84 --> 1355.36
you hear somebody basically uttering

1352.72 --> 1356.48
mind mistakes he immediately addresses

1355.36 --> 1358.32
that

1356.48 --> 1360.4
and if he then doesn't get a chance to

1358.32 --> 1362.24
do that then it turns into a rumpus fest

1360.4 --> 1365.1200000000001
and he gets super atta

1362.24 --> 1366.72
yeah agitated and you know what happens

1365.12 --> 1370.2399999999998
afterward

1366.72 --> 1371.3600000000001
but if yeah if he gets a chance to

1370.24 --> 1376.24
address it

1371.36 --> 1378.08
and the person does actually respond

1376.24 --> 1379.52
then things are all right so this has

1378.08 --> 1382.24
even happened to me

1379.52 --> 1383.9189999999999
like when i get a little enthusiastic it

1382.24 --> 1384.48
doesn't really happen as much anymore

1383.919 --> 1386.7990000000002
but like

1384.48 --> 1389.039
years ago on the flat earth debates even

1386.799 --> 1391.2
when i was very enthusiastic i would be

1389.039 --> 1393.039
like fearful i was not able to bring out

1391.2 --> 1393.76
my point which was kind of unique back

1393.039 --> 1397.44
then

1393.76 --> 1398.8799999999999
from a unique flat earth angle of things

1397.44 --> 1401.1200000000001
and was just afraid i couldn't put it

1398.88 --> 1402.96
out so i would kind of yell and rumpus

1401.12 --> 1404.1589999999999
it sometimes if nathan would get

1402.96 --> 1406.799
technical with me

1404.159 --> 1407.2800000000002
and point that i didn't really think

1406.799 --> 1409.84
through

1407.28 --> 1411.2
everything perfectly yet because i

1409.84 --> 1413.12
didn't have a full technical

1411.2 --> 1415.52
understanding of physics and what it all

1413.12 --> 1417.12
actually is and the gravity situation

1415.52 --> 1419.6
for example

1417.12 --> 1421.6789999999999
and then he would act to me as if i was

1419.6 --> 1422.3999999999999
a baller very shaming sometimes very

1421.679 --> 1424.0800000000002
painful

1422.4 --> 1426.5590000000002
to me when i could feel that i'm

1424.08 --> 1430.72
sensitive so

1426.559 --> 1432.799
but i've managed to fix it i responded

1430.72 --> 1433.84
to it eventually when i thought okay i

1432.799 --> 1436.559
got it out at least

1433.84 --> 1437.279
and then i let it sink and was like wait

1436.559 --> 1439.039
it was

1437.279 --> 1440.32
actually right i think i understand it

1439.039 --> 1443.12
now

1440.32 --> 1444.799
and then i adapt it my inside my

1443.12 --> 1448.039
technicals

1444.799 --> 1452.1589999999999
and now i can even dig into the

1448.039 --> 1454.24
presuppositional space cosmology effects

1452.159 --> 1456.8400000000001
to quite some detail up to science

1454.24 --> 1460.4
fiction levels

1456.84 --> 1462.3999999999999
because i can build a proper foundation

1460.4 --> 1465.2
to basically mention this and say that

1462.4 --> 1468.64
it is presuppositional to basically

1465.2 --> 1471.039
put a disclaimer before i speak about

1468.64 --> 1472.64
this is not actually real this is based

1471.039 --> 1475.679
on a mind experiment

1472.64 --> 1478.88
and because i do that yeah

1475.679 --> 1482.96
it's not the fooling the people

1478.88 --> 1485.2
wizardly effect there is a disclaimer

1482.96 --> 1486.0
i do that i build that into these types

1485.2 --> 1489.679
of

1486.0 --> 1490.96
stories and nathan appreciates that and

1489.679 --> 1493.3600000000001
respects that if i

1490.96 --> 1494.88
don't constantly ramble on because

1493.36 --> 1496.8799999999999
eventually you start to talk about

1494.88 --> 1499.96
unicorn farts or whatever because

1496.88 --> 1501.8400000000001
if i ramble two on on too long with

1499.96 --> 1503.8400000000001
presuppositional

1501.84 --> 1506.32
concepts then eventually he does get

1503.84 --> 1506.32
annoyed

1507.6 --> 1515.84
but yeah it's all about

1511.679 --> 1517.8400000000001
responding and answering questions

1515.84 --> 1519.4399999999998
and when people don't do that on

1517.84 --> 1521.84
nathan's show yeah

1519.44 --> 1523.44
yeah he gets eventually starts to get

1521.84 --> 1528.3999999999999
very nasty because

1523.44 --> 1531.2
it's like talking to a

1528.4 --> 1533.6000000000001
like somebody who's stuck in their heads

1531.2 --> 1535.679
what do you call that it's just

1533.6 --> 1536.799
weird mumbling people mumbling just

1535.679 --> 1538.72
thinking not

1536.799 --> 1540.8799999999999
really communicating just stuck in their

1538.72 --> 1542.0
heads and that's super annoying and he's

1540.88 --> 1545.44
basically getting so

1542.0 --> 1547.039
rough so shaving to kind of try to break

1545.44 --> 1548.72
that open

1547.039 --> 1552.0
and then when it breaks open it'll

1548.72 --> 1554.559
scatter and yeah

1552.0 --> 1555.76
but that might not be the best for those

1554.559 --> 1559.2
people but those people

1555.76 --> 1561.6
are so immoral

1559.2 --> 1564.159
with lies that it's really not they're

1561.6 --> 1566.08
not really worth saving anymore the only

1564.159 --> 1567.3600000000001
way they think they can be saved is just

1566.08 --> 1569.039
by breaking them and then

1567.36 --> 1571.84
hoping that they'll snap out of it

1569.039 --> 1575.2
somehow and then if they do

1571.84 --> 1579.039
then we'll try to actually

1575.2 --> 1581.1200000000001
help them but it so rarely happens

1579.039 --> 1583.44
so rarely although it does happen

1581.12 --> 1586.32
sometimes tommy for example he came on

1583.44 --> 1588.0800000000002
like a month ago or something

1586.32 --> 1590.08
say yeah i'm flat earther now very

1588.08 --> 1592.0
enthusiastic flat earther

1590.08 --> 1593.279
and when he came on the first time which

1592.0 --> 1596.0
was years ago

1593.279 --> 1597.52
he was a very enthusiastic baller very

1596.0 --> 1599.44
triggered at times

1597.52 --> 1601.76
and even talked about it so it does

1599.44 --> 1604.4
happen sometimes if you just get real

1601.76 --> 1607.039
with people if you actually attempt to

1604.4 --> 1609.76
reach them and not just pour on more

1607.039 --> 1611.279
story material for them to dream about

1609.76 --> 1613.12
because that people don't learn from

1611.279 --> 1614.88
that they just get distracted by the

1613.12 --> 1617.039
dream more

1614.88 --> 1617.0390000000002
so

1619.83 --> 1622.99
[Music]

1623.76 --> 1626.8799999999999
you'll debate me on the flight of the

1626.0 --> 1628.72
page well hey

1626.88 --> 1630.7990000000002
you're welcome to come on there in the

1628.72 --> 1632.72
discord panel mr jones

1630.799 --> 1635.039
go ahead we got the housekeeping

1632.72 --> 1637.52
questions if you got answers

1635.039 --> 1639.2
yeah you will get an opportunity to give

1637.52 --> 1642.799
those answers

1639.2 --> 1644.72
so yeah just join discord

1642.799 --> 1654.399
and yeah i'll see you in the flat earth

1644.72 --> 1657.52
debates sounds very interesting

1654.399 --> 1662.1589999999999
yeah well mr jones

1657.52 --> 1665.12
we don't really use videos

1662.159 --> 1666.0
as an evidence for flat earth we use

1665.12 --> 1670.0
physics

1666.0 --> 1674.48
and natural law established

1670.0 --> 1677.76
facts conventions realizations

1674.48 --> 1680.799
that's our foundation for a flat earth

1677.76 --> 1686.0
not a video it's a

1680.799 --> 1686.0
very nice straw man there it's incorrect

1692.159 --> 1694.96
on my chat

1695.679 --> 1701.679
okay okay well

1699.2 --> 1704.159
i don't think he'll do that but i'll

1701.679 --> 1707.279
suggest it to him

1704.159 --> 1711.0390000000002
he's debated uh ballers on

1707.279 --> 1714.24
other channels before and i know he will

1711.039 --> 1716.799
he will know that i am going to be

1714.24 --> 1718.0
a good moderator so who knows he might

1716.799 --> 1721.12
he might actually do that

1718.0 --> 1725.84
might be interesting i'll ask

1721.12 --> 1725.84
when the flat earth debates start

1728.88 --> 1733.1200000000001
[Music]

1730.0 --> 1733.6
right yeah well mr jones technically it

1733.12 --> 1736.1589999999999
is

1733.6 --> 1738.799
the videos that show you something that

1736.159 --> 1740.7990000000002
just seems out of place but is real

1738.799 --> 1742.32
that does kind of snap you out of the

1740.799 --> 1745.679
auto assumption dream

1742.32 --> 1748.08
of heliocentrism so at that

1745.679 --> 1749.52
it was also a youtube video in a way

1748.08 --> 1753.52
that snapped me out of it

1749.52 --> 1755.6
even though the one where the sun

1753.52 --> 1756.8799999999999
yeah was giving like a giant sunspot

1755.6 --> 1758.799
it's the most surreal thing i've ever

1756.88 --> 1759.44
seen and don't even know a video is

1758.799 --> 1762.32
actually

1759.44 --> 1763.1200000000001
real but i do know is that just seeing

1762.32 --> 1764.6399999999999
that

1763.12 --> 1766.559
and the music that was part of it and

1764.64 --> 1770.0
the rest of the video just really

1766.559 --> 1770.559
snapped me out of it so the video the

1770.0 --> 1774.159
visual

1770.559 --> 1776.48
snapped me out of it i guess in a shock

1774.159 --> 1777.919
move when i was ready for it i allowed

1776.48 --> 1780.32
it to snap me out of it otherwise it

1777.919 --> 1783.76
just flicked away

1780.32 --> 1784.399
so in a way yes a video has snapped us

1783.76 --> 1786.8799999999999
out of it

1784.399 --> 1788.32
me at least but as for actually

1786.88 --> 1791.1200000000001
understanding

1788.32 --> 1792.6399999999999
what's going on and finding yeah the

1791.12 --> 1795.6789999999999
reality

1792.64 --> 1799.1200000000001
through alternative routes through yeah

1795.679 --> 1801.8400000000001
bottoms up physics

1799.12 --> 1802.6399999999999
natural all that yeah that's taken some

1801.84 --> 1804.72
time

1802.64 --> 1806.64
that's not just the video but it it was

1804.72 --> 1809.559
for me the video that snapped me

1806.64 --> 1812.5590000000002
out of it out of the auto assumption of

1809.559 --> 1812.559
heliocentrism

1813.44 --> 1818.54
and now i'm not talking about a disc

1815.84 --> 1820.84
video that did not snap me out of it at

1818.54 --> 1822.32
[Music]

1820.84 --> 1826.32
all

1822.32 --> 1829.4399999999998
but high altitude balloon footage

1826.32 --> 1830.399
with a giant sun apparent sun and which

1829.44 --> 1832.0800000000002
is weird

1830.399 --> 1833.52
it was the first time i noticed like

1832.08 --> 1838.1589999999999
this this is

1833.52 --> 1840.08
this can't be real this is impossible

1838.159 --> 1842.0
it's kind of it's kind of the first hint

1840.08 --> 1842.559
i guess that i noticed that there's just

1842.0 --> 1844.48
something

1842.559 --> 1846.24
really off about by the sun and that

1844.48 --> 1849.2
it's just not

1846.24 --> 1851.039
literal it's not the light as you see it

1849.2 --> 1854.48
is

1851.039 --> 1854.48
not universal

1854.559 --> 1859.44
the way you see it is unique because in

1857.12 --> 1863.76
that video there was this giant

1859.44 --> 1865.679
circle of sunlight down there

1863.76 --> 1866.799
and that just doesn't make any sense

1865.679 --> 1870.3990000000001
that's not

1866.799 --> 1874.799
what you see on the ground it makes no

1870.399 --> 1874.799
freaking sense but it happened

1875.84 --> 1879.12
it that's what is that that's what was

1878.159 --> 1881.2
visible and that

1879.12 --> 1882.799
really snapped me out of it not even

1881.2 --> 1883.6000000000001
think oh must be three thousand miles

1882.799 --> 1885.039
away

1883.6 --> 1887.4399999999998
like a lot of people were saying no no

1885.039 --> 1889.6
it was just like whoa

1887.44 --> 1891.679
there's something really freaking weird

1889.6 --> 1895.039
about the sunlight and

1891.679 --> 1895.519
that i guess what snapped me out of it

1895.039 --> 1898.08
is

1895.519 --> 1899.919
that i saw that that i saw something

1898.08 --> 1902.399
unique that i thought that probably

1899.919 --> 1905.919
nobody would ever understand and i can

1902.399 --> 1908.1589999999999
i can bring it and i have holographic

1905.919 --> 1908.159
sun

1908.32 --> 1912.8799999999999
the sun is holographic that's how it

1910.08 --> 1916.559
started that's how i started in chat

1912.88 --> 1917.6000000000001
sun is holographic that's really what

1916.559 --> 1921.84
pulled me in

1917.6 --> 1921.84
that realization i think

1922.36 --> 1925.5
[Music]

1931.44 --> 1939.8400000000001
uh no no francis paisley absolutely not

1936.64 --> 1942.5590000000002
nope oh nathan is king

1939.84 --> 1943.84
on his platform it's his platform it's

1942.559 --> 1946.8799999999999
his freaking show

1943.84 --> 1950.799
he will do whatever the [ __ ] he wants

1946.88 --> 1953.2
whatever the [ __ ] he wants

1950.799 --> 1954.72
in the [ __ ] way he wants to [ __ ]

1953.2 --> 1956.88
do it

1954.72 --> 1958.3990000000001
swearing not swearing getting really or

1956.88 --> 1961.8400000000001
disgusting

1958.399 --> 1965.5189999999998
getting really mean-spirited it's

1961.84 --> 1967.039
what he wants to do it's how he devises

1965.519 --> 1967.679
what he is doing because there is a

1967.039 --> 1969.519
method to

1967.679 --> 1971.519
everything he's doing nothing he does

1969.519 --> 1974.48
randomly

1971.519 --> 1975.2
it's all he has a method in everything

1974.48 --> 1977.679
he does

1975.2 --> 1980.3990000000001
and i it's what it works it's doing

1977.679 --> 1983.279
something it's doing something good it's

1980.399 --> 1985.279
strengthening tightening condensing

1983.279 --> 1989.279
things the energy

1985.279 --> 1989.279
and no i will not

1989.44 --> 1993.3600000000001
absolutely not condem nathan for that

1992.559 --> 1998.24
behavior

1993.36 --> 2001.36
because he doesn't do that outside of

1998.24 --> 2005.039
outside you know unless he's

2001.36 --> 2007.039
expected to perform as nathan oakley

2005.039 --> 2008.96
and that is like if he comes on

2007.039 --> 2009.919
somewhere new you know that where people

2008.96 --> 2014.08
don't know him

2009.919 --> 2015.3600000000001
jumps in now if it's just a random kind

2014.08 --> 2018.1589999999999
of hangout place

2015.36 --> 2019.519
like 24 7 discord i don't think well he

2018.159 --> 2020.3200000000002
might have been there at some i don't

2019.519 --> 2023.519
know

2020.32 --> 2026.399
then yeah he might go right right out

2023.519 --> 2027.519
because he's just wanting to bite down

2026.399 --> 2030.08
that he does

2027.519 --> 2032.32
that's his business but if he's actually

2030.08 --> 2033.84
on a serious hangout somewhere

2032.32 --> 2035.6
with people he doesn't know he's not

2033.84 --> 2037.1999999999998
gonna he's gonna be very

2035.6 --> 2040.24
well behaved very polite because he

2037.2 --> 2042.72
knows this is not my platform

2040.24 --> 2044.3990000000001
he understands that he respects that

2042.72 --> 2046.0
he's proven that before and he's even

2044.399 --> 2049.359
explained that

2046.0 --> 2052.48
but this is his platform he

2049.359 --> 2052.96
does the things as he sees fit and

2052.48 --> 2057.52
there's

2052.96 --> 2057.52
nothing anybody can do about it

2057.599 --> 2063.119
and hey youtube doesn't seem to mind

2060.639 --> 2064.56
where that is immoral that's up for

2063.119 --> 2067.52
debate

2064.56 --> 2069.2
but it works i don't think he takes it

2067.52 --> 2071.359
too far and if he

2069.2 --> 2075.4399999999996
if it seems to me that he does then i

2071.359 --> 2079.52
will eventually try to break it up

2075.44 --> 2082.96
but it very rarely even had the tendency

2079.52 --> 2082.96
to do that because it's just not

2086.839 --> 2103.839
necessary

2089.76 --> 2103.8390000000004
okay well your troll piss off

2104.72 --> 2108.3199999999997
the light doesn't have a shape yeah

2115.359 --> 2121.2799999999997
well light shape

2119.28 --> 2122.48
look a shape is kind of a geometrical

2121.28 --> 2125.119
concept so

2122.48 --> 2125.119
good servant

2127.76 --> 2134.96
you could visualize light

2131.52 --> 2138.4
as a shape but it doesn't mean that it's

2134.96 --> 2141.44
literally that shape it's just an assist

2138.4 --> 2145.839
to the visualization process

2141.44 --> 2145.839
because light is intangible

[Music]

2163.28 --> 2166.6400000000003
where are these lawsuits anyone winning

2165.119 --> 2169.92
them yeah

2166.64 --> 2169.92
well they're in the works

2171.2 --> 2175.839
and usually when lawsuits like these

2173.44 --> 2175.839
happen

2176.48 --> 2180.0
they don't initiate unless they know

2178.48 --> 2182.64
they can win

2180.0 --> 2183.52
because there are these stupid

2182.64 --> 2186.16
exemptions

2183.52 --> 2187.92
for certain companies when they are used

2186.16 --> 2189.7599999999998
in four vaccines

2187.92 --> 2191.119
yeah that's not yeah you can't engage in

2189.76 --> 2194.4
that

2191.119 --> 2196.96
that's because yeah

2194.4 --> 2199.839
they had waivers against it or how

2196.96 --> 2202.0
whatever you call that

2199.839 --> 2203.359
but if there's gonna be a lawsuit then

2202.0 --> 2206.32
they will

2203.359 --> 2210.0
of course have viable grounds to do that

2206.32 --> 2210.0
or it would make no sense to engage with

2212.839 --> 2215.839
that

2261.839 --> 2266.88
do i believe relative density is

2264.32 --> 2269.76
equilibrium

2266.88 --> 2271.28
as a concept well i understand it it's

2269.76 --> 2273.8390000000004
scientifically proven

2271.28 --> 2275.6800000000003
it's scientifically valid and repeatable

2273.839 --> 2277.599
for anyone who wants to

2275.68 --> 2278.7999999999997
test whether relative density really

2277.599 --> 2281.839
exists

2278.8 --> 2284.8
is physically real scientifically viable

2281.839 --> 2284.7999999999997
yeah they can test that

2287.92 --> 2291.2000000000003
okay mr jones somebody else just gave

2290.72 --> 2295.7599999999998
you

2291.2 --> 2295.7599999999998
a very specific example of a court case

2296.56 --> 2301.2999999999997

an

2312.0 --> 2327.839
i'll give you a wrench for that

2315.04 --> 2327.839
i think you deserve that wrench anyway

2336.96 --> 2341.839
do you have any here we go again that

2338.72 --> 2341.839
would be interesting

this happening all the time with ballers

2379.839 --> 2386.72
and normies that that work like that

2383.28 --> 2388.0
from the school minds every time every

2386.72 --> 2389.5989999999997
time you even say

2388.0 --> 2391.839
anything about anything out there in the

2389.599 --> 2394.0
world you immediately have to present

2391.839 --> 2398.16
the full data for everything it's like

2394.0 --> 2398.16
oh really do you have that

2398.64 --> 2403.359
do you have such available data every

2401.68 --> 2406.16
time you make a remark

2403.359 --> 2406.16
mr jones

2406.48 --> 2425.839
is that reasonable hey what's that

2412.079 --> 2425.8390000000004
check it out

2428.4 --> 2435.28
okay is this a documentary about

2432.56 --> 2439.839
or does it actually mention the specific

2435.28 --> 2439.8390000000004
case there here we go again

2452.0 --> 2456.72
it's yeah sure informative but

2457.2 --> 2461.52
does it actually address a specific

2464.839 --> 2467.839
lawsuit

2468.0 --> 2481.839
hey julia kevin

2492.839 --> 2495.839
oh

2496.8 --> 2509.8390000000004
okay entire list that's interesting

2512.8 --> 2516.2400000000002
yeah that'll do it

2514.5 --> 2520.319
[Music]

2516.24 --> 2520.319
right thank you for that

2521.2 --> 2525.5989999999997
so i hope that mr jones now bites his

2524.319 --> 2530.16
tongue and

2525.599 --> 2530.1600000000003
withdraws from such statements in the

2531.08 --> 2534.21
[Music]

2534.839 --> 2537.839
future

2566.48 --> 2571.28
didn't mention vexical cares what you

2568.72 --> 2574.0789999999997
mentioned you said any lawsuits

2571.28 --> 2574.079
so there it is

2575.52 --> 2579.52
it doesn't matter if you weren't

2577.2 --> 2583.4399999999996
specific

2579.52 --> 2583.44
you were general that that only made it

2590.839 --> 2593.839
easier

2598.56 --> 2602.56
okay well mr jones that's really funny

2600.88 --> 2605.2000000000003
because out there

2602.56 --> 2606.16
that is that is placed under the

2605.2 --> 2609.4399999999996
designation

2606.16 --> 2610.3999999999996
science as well the science of vaccines

2609.44 --> 2613.68
right

2610.4 --> 2620.1600000000003
so yeah i think that's probably why it

2613.68 --> 2623.7599999999998
was brought up

2620.16 --> 2634.3999999999996
medical signs right but there's also

2623.76 --> 2649.8390000000004
medical pseudoscience

2634.4 --> 2649.839
that that also happens it's very tough

2653.52 --> 2657.599
no medical pseudoscience like faith

2656.24 --> 2659.9199999999996
healers you don't know what the [ __ ]

2657.599 --> 2661.92
you're talking about

2659.92 --> 2664.079
first of all that doesn't fall under

2661.92 --> 2667.599
medical that's just healing

2664.079 --> 2669.52
natural healing and that deals a lot

2667.599 --> 2671.92
with psychosomatics which is

2669.52 --> 2673.2
a proper foundation even within the

2671.92 --> 2677.359
medical system

2673.2 --> 2680.0789999999997
i have to keep track of that huh huh

2677.359 --> 2681.119
placebo effect and all that right

2680.079 --> 2684.319
psychosomatic

2681.119 --> 2686.88
so yeah faith healers

2684.319 --> 2689.04
yeah it's yeah you can't really pinpoint

2686.88 --> 2692.4
how they do that right it's just hey

2689.04 --> 2695.7599999999998
the person's doing something and it can

2692.4 --> 2698.1600000000003
help or it might not help but hey

2695.76 --> 2700.1600000000003
something's happening a lot of the time

2698.16 --> 2701.92
so yeah isn't it helping well yeah it

2700.16 --> 2702.64
doesn't fall under science i get that

2701.92 --> 2705.839
doesn't mean

2702.64 --> 2705.839
it doesn't work

2706.56 --> 2710.0789999999997
whatever yeah you call faith healing you

2708.88 --> 2712.48
know

2710.079 --> 2713.92
what exactly is faith healing is it just

2712.48 --> 2716.96
prayer or is it

2713.92 --> 2718.16
lay on hands or is it reiki is it

2716.96 --> 2721.359
magnetization

2718.16 --> 2722.319
is it meditation like what you know it's

2721.359 --> 2724.88
kind of broad

2722.319 --> 2724.88
like that

2729.92 --> 2734.16
[Music]

2731.68 --> 2737.2799999999997
now don't time anyone out good servant

2734.16 --> 2737.2799999999997
i'm gonna take your wrench

2741.52 --> 2747.839
and don't don't poke him mr jones

2749.23 --> 2752.84
[Music]

2756.23 --> 2762.239
[Music]

2763.92 --> 2766.16
well

2768.96 --> 2775.839
well it's none of your concern really

2770.96 --> 2775.839
what he should do

2790.6 --> 2794.88
[Music]

2792.079 --> 2797.04
yep have to remember good servant is a

2794.88 --> 2800.1600000000003
very devout christian

2797.04 --> 2801.7599999999998
it's very personal to him so don't don't

2800.16 --> 2805.04
do that

2801.76 --> 2805.0400000000004
if you start to nag

2805.68 --> 2810.7999999999997
people in my chat that yeah you have

2809.04 --> 2812.24
been loyal followers for a long time if

2810.8 --> 2814.0
you're gonna nag them like that i will

2812.24 --> 2817.839
just kick you for that eventually

2814.0 --> 2817.839
so don't just don't

2819.04 --> 2825.44
a good conversation if a discussion

2822.16 --> 2831.839
can even get heated if you just

2825.44 --> 2831.839
stay civil in the process

2837.04 --> 2841.44
oh really so tiny wumbo how is it not

2839.2 --> 2843.9199999999996
effective

2841.44 --> 2844.48
it's kind of almost a self-contradictory

2843.92 --> 2847.28
statement

2844.48 --> 2847.28
if it's real

2850.319 --> 2854.16
if it's not if it's not doing anything

2852.4 --> 2859.839
then how can you say it's real

2854.16 --> 2859.839
that doesn't make any sense

2863.2 --> 2872.5589999999997
yeah well mr jones nobody's claiming

2866.8 --> 2875.76
faith healing is science okay

2872.559 --> 2875.76
now what is claiming that

2884.16 --> 2889.04
now i'm addressing mr jones tiny womble

2890.319 --> 2903.52
oh right right

2901.28 --> 2906.0
oh okay so you're done yeah you're just

2903.52 --> 2908.24
a skeptic tiny well that's really cute

2906.0 --> 2910.319
it's really cute you don't believe in it

2908.24 --> 2913.839
don't give a [ __ ] that just means that

2910.319 --> 2915.599
you're blocked yeah i've done my

2913.839 --> 2917.359
magnetization on people that were

2915.599 --> 2919.6800000000003
skeptical against it

2917.359 --> 2921.5989999999997
and even though they freaking did feel

2919.68 --> 2924.64
something absolutely

2921.599 --> 2928.1600000000003
they just rejected it they just say no

2924.64 --> 2931.68
that doesn't mean anything

2928.16 --> 2931.68
because they don't want to know

2931.92 --> 2943.839
so that's cute

2950.88 --> 2955.44
you can't cure someone's cancer by

2953.28 --> 2957.8390000000004
placing your hands on that person that's

2955.44 --> 2957.839
right

2960.8 --> 2965.28
that's not how that works that's correct

2963.68 --> 2969.04
although

2965.28 --> 2971.599
yeah with proper training and proper

2969.04 --> 2974.48
momentum there might be people out there

2971.599 --> 2976.6400000000003
that are like very high spirited very

2974.48 --> 2979.52
pure that might actually do that and

2976.64 --> 2979.52
literally just

2979.76 --> 2985.8390000000004
displace it out of existence

2986.24 --> 2990.319
i've seen that one time on a video now

2988.4 --> 2992.64
yeah it's disputable because it was on a

2990.319 --> 2994.64
video but i have seen some

2992.64 --> 2997.1189999999997
and experienced some pretty incredible

2994.64 --> 3000.319
[ __ ] like that

2997.119 --> 3000.319
including with myself

3003.04 --> 3006.4
it's never happened so far well that's

3004.96 --> 3008.8
because you don't even freaking

3006.4 --> 3013.839
understand what cancer is buddy

3008.8 --> 3013.8390000000004
yeah i'm pretty sure i've had it

3015.92 --> 3019.76
because yeah everybody has it by the way

3018.4 --> 3022.8
all their lives

3019.76 --> 3024.8
20 types at least right

3022.8 --> 3027.599
and i think that it did manifest at some

3024.8 --> 3031.119
point due to incredible stress

3027.599 --> 3033.52
but because i didn't go to doctors with

3031.119 --> 3036.079
that [ __ ] and panic

3033.52 --> 3037.52
i did kind of panic but i sat through it

3036.079 --> 3039.44
and just thought like okay

3037.52 --> 3040.88
well i'm just gonna go through the

3039.44 --> 3044.48
strain of this all

3040.88 --> 3047.119
and either i will die and snap or

3044.48 --> 3048.0
or i will just one day wake up and it'll

3047.119 --> 3051.52
be done

3048.0 --> 3055.839
it'll be better again and it did

3051.52 --> 3055.839
so yeah

3067.68 --> 3074.5589999999997
yeah oh viruses

3071.2 --> 3077.359
aren't really even what they say it is

3074.559 --> 3077.3590000000004
mr jones

3080.88 --> 3086.48
no i think i have cancer because i

3082.72 --> 3086.48
understand what it is and how it works

3089.2 --> 3093.2
because i've learned that through my dad

3091.44 --> 3094.88
through german new medicine was very

3093.2 --> 3096.319
tough pill for me to swallow that

3094.88 --> 3098.88
because it's so

3096.319 --> 3100.64
in contrast to the medical system how we

3098.88 --> 3105.76
are used to seeing things

3100.64 --> 3109.359
it is absolutely real and scientifically

3105.76 --> 3111.5200000000004
proven [ __ ] yeah

3109.359 --> 3112.5589999999997
in court he was dragged in court for

3111.52 --> 3114.96
that

3112.559 --> 3116.1600000000003
dr hammer he was dragged in court over

3114.96 --> 3117.68
german new medicine

3116.16 --> 3119.839
it wasn't called german new medic it was

3117.68 --> 3123.68
just called new medicine back then

3119.839 --> 3126.96
dragged into court and he [ __ ] won

3123.68 --> 3130.16
[ __ ] he won

3126.96 --> 3131.56
yeah because it was real what he did his

3130.16 --> 3133.68
studies were real

3131.56 --> 3136.0
[Music]

3133.68 --> 3137.5989999999997
can't handle that can't handle the truth

3136.0 --> 3139.839
so as soon as he won it was just

3137.599 --> 3141.04
shoved it under the carpet nobody ever

3139.839 --> 3142.7999999999997
heard of him

3141.04 --> 3145.2
in the media i was never mentioned it

3142.8 --> 3153.8390000000004
didn't happen

3145.2 --> 3153.839
it happened this century yeah

3154.559 --> 3157.76
i think or was it even last century ah

3156.4 --> 3159.92
[ __ ] i should

3157.76 --> 3162.0
read up on it again when it exact i know

3159.92 --> 3164.2400000000002
that he worked on the german medicine

3162.0 --> 3164.24
like

3164.64 --> 3170.8799999999997
80s and 90s or something right then

3167.92 --> 3172.8
but there was a court case and he

3170.88 --> 3176.6400000000003
[ __ ] won

3172.8 --> 3179.119
well he was being sued for malpractice

3176.64 --> 3181.04
and pseudoscience i think for a

3179.119 --> 3183.52
falsifying things and [ __ ]

3181.04 --> 3185.839
they they threw the books at him he had

3183.52 --> 3187.04
like like a whole machine of lawyers

3185.839 --> 3188.88
after him

3187.04 --> 3191.04
because he was basically effectively

3188.88 --> 3192.1600000000003
competing with the entire world medical

3191.04 --> 3194.319
system

3192.16 --> 3196.7999999999997
with his works like the entire thing

3194.319 --> 3199.52
it's super opposing

3196.8 --> 3200.8
but it worked what he did worked was

3199.52 --> 3204.319
repeatable

3200.8 --> 3209.04
testable many many many

3204.319 --> 3211.44
decades of testing decades

3209.04 --> 3212.48
hundreds of people thousands even i

3211.44 --> 3215.92
think

3212.48 --> 3217.28
decades of testing yeah the german new

3215.92 --> 3220.559
medicine

3217.28 --> 3223.76
system the configuration of what's

3220.559 --> 3227.76
actually going on with the body

3223.76 --> 3231.76
why we get diseases why we get cancer

3227.76 --> 3235.8390000000004
where how when how the cycles work

3231.76 --> 3239.119
the whole thing german new medicine

3235.839 --> 3241.68
been out there for decades it's shoved

3239.119 --> 3244.48
under the carpet dramatically

3241.68 --> 3245.52
they tried to sue him out of existence

3244.48 --> 3248.079
and he won

3245.52 --> 3250.0
he freaking won they couldn't do [ __ ]

3248.079 --> 3253.3590000000004
after that

3250.0 --> 3255.76
so it's just never heard of him

3253.359 --> 3258.319
his websites get banned his works when

3255.76 --> 3261.3590000000004
put online get banned and this is

3258.319 --> 3263.119
this is very like it's so banned

3261.359 --> 3264.7999999999997
we don't even get to hear about it here

3263.119 --> 3266.96
in the alternative sector where we talk

3264.8 --> 3269.04
about how certain videos got bad no no

3266.96 --> 3270.64
we don't even hear about that [ __ ] that

3269.04 --> 3279.839
[ __ ] got banned to go

3270.64 --> 3279.839
instantly 10 years ago and more

3284.84 --> 3287.8990000000003
[Music]

3295.76 --> 3307.8390000000004
right did you also know that he appealed

3327.839 --> 3331.2799999999997
anyway if you're yeah it's very nice

3329.839 --> 3334.799
rocket man very cute

3331.28 --> 3338.3190000000004
but you can also actually do some

3334.799 --> 3340.24
background research on the whole thing

3338.319 --> 3341.599
go through the evidence that was

3340.24 --> 3344.9599999999996
presented in court

3341.599 --> 3349.839
and then actually figure out how they

3344.96 --> 3349.839
went after him

3352.96 --> 3356.559
what are you talking about here we go

3354.319 --> 3356.5589999999997
again

3357.04 --> 3365.7599999999998
i don't i don't know rick simpson

3362.559 --> 3365.76
all right rocketman thanks

3369.2 --> 3374.72
i always thought he won but it might be

3371.28 --> 3374.7200000000003
that he won on the

3375.359 --> 3378.24
it's been a while

3379.04 --> 3384.72
it's been like five years since i even

3383.04 --> 3386.4
last read up on that

3384.72 --> 3387.839
because there are websites that

3386.4 --> 3390.64
basically help you

3387.839 --> 3392.72
figure out basic sort of like how to

3390.64 --> 3393.52
triangulate a certain issue and like

3392.72 --> 3395.1189999999997
reflect

3393.52 --> 3397.68
it'll tell you basically where it's

3395.119 --> 3399.839
coming from

3397.68 --> 3400.72
and then you i can pinpoint it's very

3399.839 --> 3402.48
useful

3400.72 --> 3404.64
but actually the background works i

3402.48 --> 3407.839
haven't read that

3404.64 --> 3410.64
all of it read through some of it

3407.839 --> 3411.92
i heard my dad out about it and i think

3410.64 --> 3414.24
that he

3411.92 --> 3416.48
i don't know how it eventually went down

3414.24 --> 3418.319
if he actually did get convicted

3416.48 --> 3419.839
but i'm pretty sure that in the key

3418.319 --> 3423.2
points

3419.839 --> 3426.64
they could not disprove his works

3423.2 --> 3429.2
as it were they could not falsify

3426.64 --> 3430.48
or they yeah it could not be proven to

3429.2 --> 3432.5589999999997
be false

3430.48 --> 3434.88
the actual works that's what i remember

3432.559 --> 3434.88
of it

3435.92 --> 3443.44
cbd oil treatment for cancer yeah

3439.52 --> 3446.96
also helps but germany medicine

3443.44 --> 3449.599
approaches it even differently it's very

3446.96 --> 3449.599
fascinating

3450.4 --> 3457.839
right but yes a lot of yeah unique

3454.4 --> 3458.799
nutritions can help the body in all

3457.839 --> 3461.04
kinds of ways

3458.799 --> 3462.559
including with cancer situations because

3461.04 --> 3465.92
cancer is just a

3462.559 --> 3465.92
mechanism of the body

3466.48 --> 3472.48
it's actually a clean up mechanism

3469.599 --> 3474.799
also kind of like viruses but it's even

3472.48 --> 3477.68
tied in with like there are viruses

3474.799 --> 3479.599
and cancer it's like another compartment

3477.68 --> 3481.9199999999996
it's like viruses are the local cleanup

3479.599 --> 3483.839
mechanism and cancer is another type is

3481.92 --> 3487.839
more like an encapsulating

3483.839 --> 3490.64
mechanism and how it usually works is

3487.839 --> 3492.24
something get extremely inflamed

3490.64 --> 3494.16
and then if the inflammation like

3492.24 --> 3497.2
reaches sort of a

3494.16 --> 3498.72
critical situation i don't exactly know

3497.2 --> 3501.1189999999997
how it works biochem

3498.72 --> 3502.0789999999997
chemically then the cancer just breaks

3501.119 --> 3505.119
out

3502.079 --> 3506.96
and starts to and try to encapsulate the

3505.119 --> 3509.599
situation

3506.96 --> 3510.799
and what dr hammer tied it into is to

3509.599 --> 3514.079
emotional

3510.799 --> 3518.4
trauma the experience of it and

3514.079 --> 3521.3590000000004
the psychological resolving of that

3518.4 --> 3523.04
it's fascinating yeah that's right i

3521.359 --> 3524.0789999999997
told viruses are not what they're being

3523.04 --> 3526.72
told that's right

3524.079 --> 3530.799
cleanup mechanism i just said it

3526.72 --> 3533.5989999999997
starting to piss me off mr jones

3530.799 --> 3536.079
you're just saying [ __ ] no to every

3533.599 --> 3538.1600000000003
single thing i put forward

3536.079 --> 3539.76
are you even interested in figuring out

3538.16 --> 3541.5989999999997
what the [ __ ] is going on in this world

3539.76 --> 3544.13
at this point man

3541.599 --> 3547.28
starting to get really sick in me

3544.13 --> 3547.28
[Music]

3551.38 --> 3559.839
[Music]

3554.799 --> 3559.839
wow weather isn't exactly helping either

3567.28 --> 3587.8390000000004
raining and storming in the yuck um

3598.839 --> 3601.839
right

3605.27 --> 3609.92
[Music]

3606.4 --> 3613.76
right yeah you know viruses

3609.92 --> 3614.559
if you give it a name i designate them

3613.76 --> 3618.079
uh

3614.559 --> 3618.079
damn it no i lost it

3620.4 --> 3629.839
i had such a good word in my head now i

3622.16 --> 3629.839
lost it dammit

3640.839 --> 3643.839
hmm

3644.559 --> 3647.76
right it's a cellular metabolic

3646.88 --> 3657.839
emergency

3647.76 --> 3657.8390000000004
response mechanism that's it

3682.839 --> 3685.839
right

3698.48 --> 3703.92
hmm simpson oil yeah yeah yeah i

3701.28 --> 3703.92
remember that

3704.24 --> 3709.52
i still remember like the cure for all

3706.72 --> 3713.839
cancers and it was also in there

3709.52 --> 3713.839
good stuff

3716.48 --> 3720.4
there used to be like this movie on

3718.799 --> 3724.48
google video remember

3720.4 --> 3728.079
google video last seen in 2010

3724.48 --> 3731.68
where there was a movie on there called

3728.079 --> 3735.44
a hundred cures for cancer and it's

3731.68 --> 3738.319
not it's not an exaggeration

3735.44 --> 3740.0
it was a sum up of like all these

3738.319 --> 3743.7599999999998
different types of approaches like the

3740.0 --> 3744.559
whole works it's insane how much of it

3743.76 --> 3748.559
is out there

3744.559 --> 3748.559
it's just insane how many ways

3751.44 --> 3757.68
like from really common ways of

3754.88 --> 3759.28
doing it with herbs and [ __ ] to like

3757.68 --> 3762.0789999999997
advanced medical

3759.28 --> 3762.079
alternatives

3763.76 --> 3770.2400000000002
dr brzezinski was in there and uh

3770.96 --> 3777.68
and simpson man oh yeah

3774.24 --> 3779.7599999999998
yeah and also using uh electric

3777.68 --> 3782.0789999999997
pulses so what's it called again oh yeah

3779.76 --> 3786.0
she she died some time ago

3782.079 --> 3788.48
there's so many things it's just nuts

3786.0 --> 3790.16
but it kind of been slipping my mind i'm

3788.48 --> 3790.799
really sorry i didn't download that

3790.16 --> 3792.799
video

3790.799 --> 3794.0
although i might have downloaded that

3792.799 --> 3797.599
video and now that means

3794.0 --> 3799.68
it it got on another hard disk

3797.599 --> 3801.039
i think the one that actually crashed i

3799.68 --> 3804.319
think yeah because one time

3801.039 --> 3804.3190000000004
one of my storage disks

3805.44 --> 3810.48
it just didn't work anymore very sad

3808.24 --> 3814.0
although most of it was just regular

3810.48 --> 3814.0
downloaded movies and all that

3817.76 --> 3825.8390000000004
did she die of cancer i don't know i

3820.24 --> 3825.839
don't remember

3828.88 --> 3835.52
might be but it was really interesting

3833.52 --> 3836.88
and then there's the rife machine which

3835.52 --> 3838.24
is kind of similar

3836.88 --> 3840.6400000000003
principles it's just using

3838.24 --> 3844.4799999999996
electrostatics to basically

3840.64 --> 3848.16
help the body naturally purge toxins

3844.48 --> 3852.48
it does work i've tested it myself

3848.16 --> 3853.359
and it's pretty astounding a quick

3852.48 --> 3855.039
result but

3853.359 --> 3857.839
yeah it's not something that i would

3855.039 --> 3867.8390000000004
want to do like for a prolonged period

3857.839 --> 3867.839
but it was kind of cleansing anyway

3874.079 --> 3877.119
something will get us you don't really

3875.839 --> 3880.88
die of old age

3877.119 --> 3884.1600000000003
well what is old age

3880.88 --> 3886.88
old age is your system just not

3884.16 --> 3888.72
losing its optimal function eventually

3886.88 --> 3892.1600000000003
aspect of that system

3888.72 --> 3895.2
will break

3892.16 --> 3896.5589999999997
or break out and that can be your organs

3895.2 --> 3898.68
failing or it can be

3896.559 --> 3901.119
yeah literally on the micro

3898.68 --> 3904.96
microcellular level

3901.119 --> 3907.6800000000003
the cancer eventually might just

3904.96 --> 3908.64
happen anyway or because there's just

3907.68 --> 3911.2799999999997
nothing to

3908.64 --> 3911.7599999999998
prevent all that from going it's like

3911.28 --> 3915.92
yeah

3911.76 --> 3923.8390000000004
like a dying empire yeah

3915.92 --> 3923.839
but in this case an old person so yeah

3932.64 --> 3936.0789999999997
no tiny womble i think it's an absolute

3935.52 --> 3939.7599999999998
[ __ ]

3936.079 --> 3941.2000000000003
story 40 years old in medieval times no

3939.76 --> 3943.44
no no no

3941.2 --> 3946.96
i i bet there were periods where people

3943.44 --> 3949.039
were literally treated so terribly

3946.96 --> 3950.079
and deprived of food that they would

3949.039 --> 3952.1600000000003
simply not be able to

3950.079 --> 3953.119
live very long but it's only because of

3952.16 --> 3955.7599999999998
the slave

3953.119 --> 3956.1600000000003
conditions that were considered normal

3955.76 --> 3959.44
for

3956.16 --> 3961.92
some time but before that it's total

3959.44 --> 3964.319
nonsense

3961.92 --> 3966.079
and there were still kind of free

3964.319 --> 3967.119
roaming people that would stay in the

3966.079 --> 3970.2400000000002
wilderness

3967.119 --> 3971.92
that would live very long

3970.24 --> 3973.839
because they wouldn't be depraved

3971.92 --> 3975.2000000000003
because they would be free and able to

3973.839 --> 3979.839
find

3975.2 --> 3979.839
whatever food they needed

3985.359 --> 3992.0789999999997
there were much more wild spots

3989.359 --> 3994.16
in europe during medieval times more

3992.079 --> 3997.28
forests

3994.16 --> 4000.16
more wild places more swamps

3997.28 --> 4000.7200000000003
so yeah plenty of life around to survive

4000.16 --> 4004.48
on

4000.72 --> 4005.799
and berries and whatever

4004.48 --> 4008.96
now of course after the

4005.799 --> 4014.16
industrialization that all changed

4008.96 --> 4017.68
so much was ruined and yeah

4014.16 --> 4021.839
transformed into living grounds and

4017.68 --> 4021.839
farms and all that

4024.96 --> 4029.28
but that story oh people didn't get that

4027.2 --> 4031.52
old i think it's total [ __ ]

4029.28 --> 4034.7200000000003
that's only in places where people were

4031.52 --> 4038.48
just deprived

4034.72 --> 4038.48
by their by their rulers

4040.079 --> 4043.76
no one lived till 900 years old that's

4042.48 --> 4046.64
for sure oh really

4043.76 --> 4047.119
what about have you have you seen the

4046.64 --> 4050.96
bible

4047.119 --> 4054.0
how old people in this extremely ancient

4050.96 --> 4057.52
times actually got to live

4054.0 --> 4060.24
said to have lived for is it hundreds of

4057.52 --> 4060.24
years some of

4060.96 --> 4066.2400000000002
no the boom them fables oh you're gonna

4063.599 --> 4070.0
get a timeout for that

4066.24 --> 4070.0
that's yeah

4070.799 --> 4077.119
yeah just because you think it's fables

4074.4 --> 4078.48
doesn't mean it is you don't know what

4077.119 --> 4080.079
it is

4078.48 --> 4081.76
because if you would say that then you

4080.079 --> 4083.44
don't know what it is you don't know

4081.76 --> 4085.3590000000004
what the bible is you have no freaking

4083.44 --> 4087.68
clue

4085.359 --> 4088.799
you don't understand it because you

4087.68 --> 4090.96
think it's fables

4088.799 --> 4094.799
and if you knew what the bible was you

4090.96 --> 4094.799
would never just call it fables

4098.0 --> 4104.64
the bible is evidence well

4101.12 --> 4107.5199999999995
it has evidence it has testimonies it

4104.64 --> 4110.88
has descriptions that are quite

4107.52 --> 4115.1990000000005
unique and very old made

4110.88 --> 4115.1990000000005
in old times by old mindsets

4117.44 --> 4123.2789999999995
and as i don't know for we have whatever

4120.56 --> 4125.92
you consider it worth that that is

4123.279 --> 4133.279
at least partial historical evidence

4125.92 --> 4135.839
just by the essence

4133.279 --> 4137.0
although it yeah it has been prone to

4135.839 --> 4140.88
political

4137.0 --> 4142.719
reinterpretation and all that of course

4140.88 --> 4144.4800000000005
but that doesn't mean that the essence

4142.719 --> 4145.92
of it all is completely lost it's just

4144.48 --> 4149.599999999999
that it's somewhat blurred

4145.92 --> 4150.4800000000005
out it's not entirely clear anymore it

4149.6 --> 4153.759
becomes more

4150.48 --> 4154.4
exoteric as that happens more about

4153.759 --> 4157.839
control

4154.4 --> 4159.199
and about specifics and distracting

4157.839 --> 4161.679
details

4159.199 --> 4162.879999999999
instead of the core essence the esoteric

4161.679 --> 4165.679
original

4162.88 --> 4165.679
essence of it all

4169.759 --> 4173.359
anyway i'm gonna round out the show so

4171.52 --> 4175.279
thanks everyone for coming
