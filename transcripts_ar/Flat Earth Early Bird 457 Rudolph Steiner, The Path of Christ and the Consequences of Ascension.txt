so

82.0 --> 85.439
morning everyone

84.0 --> 87.6
let's see

85.439 --> 89.27999999999999
but the weather is out there

87.6 --> 92.32
it's

89.28 --> 94.32000000000001
very very windy

92.32 --> 97.52
again

94.32 --> 101.36
pretty constant gale

97.52 --> 103.52
and sometimes pretty pretty pretty hard

101.36 --> 103.52
so

104.479 --> 109.759
but no rain yet at least

106.96 --> 109.759
that's all fine

112.0 --> 117.68
as you can see if you look carefully

114.159 --> 119.43900000000001
that the clouds are rushing up there

117.68 --> 121.28
very fast

119.439 --> 122.79899999999999
so yeah we'll see what the

121.28 --> 125.52
saturday is going to be like it feels a

122.799 --> 126.84
bit restless i woke up this day very

125.52 --> 130.239
very

126.84 --> 131.92000000000002
restless extremely

130.239 --> 134.48000000000002
but i

131.92 --> 138.64
managed to call my healer

134.48 --> 140.72
let's see like two hours ago and

138.64 --> 144.07999999999998
that completely turned things around for

140.72 --> 146.64
me so i feel so much better now

144.08 --> 150.239
i just had a lot of pressure on me

146.64 --> 152.16
from very complex high esoteric things

150.239 --> 154.84
energy things and

152.16 --> 156.56
yeah he totally got it

154.84 --> 158.4
and

156.56 --> 161.28
that's that's part of the thing it's

158.4 --> 163.84
like it's pretty tough for me to find

161.28 --> 165.2
people that can

163.84 --> 168.72
handle

165.2 --> 170.64
the impact of like the very heavy

168.72 --> 172.879
top things that i deal with and the

170.64 --> 174.72
complexities that come with them and

172.879 --> 175.51899999999998
he's one of the few that can really do

174.72 --> 177.44
that

175.519 --> 179.04
and be an effective healer at the same

177.44 --> 181.44
time so

179.04 --> 184.56
and he yeah i guess it's in a way

181.44 --> 187.44
exhilarating for him as well because

184.56 --> 189.2
he really takes me seriously

187.44 --> 190.0
and

189.2 --> 191.51899999999998
yeah

190.0 --> 193.44
and

191.519 --> 195.36
at the same time he's for me a valuable

193.44 --> 196.959
source

195.36 --> 198.87900000000002
for

196.959 --> 201.519
for the teachings of rudolf steiner

198.879 --> 204.959
which just keep on coming back and yeah

201.519 --> 207.36
i keep on bringing them back as well

204.959 --> 208.72
such a

207.36 --> 211.72000000000003
all

208.72 --> 211.72
culture

212.159 --> 216.159
there's something really magical about

214.0 --> 216.159
it

216.4 --> 220.72
and i'm doing my best to embrace it and

218.56 --> 222.4
understand it better

220.72 --> 225.04
and it's

222.4 --> 228.31900000000002
yeah part of the reason that spawned my

225.04 --> 231.12
concept even of the path of christ which

228.319 --> 234.48
i think that rudolf steiner was

231.12 --> 236.72
kind of on the same road

234.48 --> 236.72
so

237.76 --> 243.92
yeah so did i get in sick

240.72 --> 243.92
but i was kind of

244.959 --> 251.92000000000002
i was also very much into heliocentrism

248.159 --> 251.92
and outer space at the same time

253.84 --> 258.479
it was all very complex the situation

256.16 --> 260.959
was very complex i got confronted with

258.479 --> 262.079
like pretty deep issues

260.959 --> 264.24
from the

262.079 --> 266.72
people that went to those schools there

264.24 --> 268.639
and they're kind of raising

266.72 --> 269.84000000000003
some of them were apparently i think

268.639 --> 272.16
jewish

269.84 --> 274.88
and christian

272.16 --> 277.52000000000004
from uh

274.88 --> 280.0
from different angles it's like and some

277.52 --> 283.68
were kind of liberal and it

280.0 --> 286.88
it wasn't yeah it's it was mixed but

283.68 --> 288.479
just the program and how i responded to

286.88 --> 292.08
it because they were

288.479 --> 293.84
not focused on heliocentrism at all

292.08 --> 296.32
not really

293.84 --> 298.23999999999995
they were kind of giving an alternative

296.32 --> 300.32
culture as it was they have an

298.24 --> 302.639
alternative school culture it is very

300.32 --> 305.12
fascinating it is so different

302.639 --> 307.12
but it it is kind of useful especially

305.12 --> 309.12
if you're a sensitive person

307.12 --> 312.24
but at the same time

309.12 --> 314.24
yeah if you're surrounded by a

312.24 --> 316.40000000000003
class full of kids

314.24 --> 318.40000000000003
they're going to make fun of you if you

316.4 --> 320.08
show to be sensitive and that is kind of

318.4 --> 322.479
what happened to me

320.08 --> 322.479
and

322.84 --> 327.28
yeah so

325.84 --> 330.56
yeah you're still gonna have to deal

327.28 --> 333.75899999999996
with human nature no matter what

330.56 --> 335.6
what it comes down to but yeah i i

333.759 --> 338.32
resisted

335.6 --> 340.32000000000005
a lot of what

338.32 --> 342.71999999999997
that type of schooling had to offer in a

340.32 --> 345.44
way like i embrace certain parts very

342.72 --> 347.28000000000003
deeply like even the esoteric

345.44 --> 350.24
things like the

347.28 --> 351.35999999999996
just the feel and energy and

350.24 --> 353.919
all that

351.36 --> 357.6
proper hippie culture well maybe maybe

353.919 --> 358.71999999999997
in a way it is very sensitive feely also

357.6 --> 360.319
that is

358.72 --> 361.84000000000003
an odd thing that i've noticed in

360.319 --> 365.08000000000004
general

361.84 --> 365.08
is that

367.6 --> 371.91900000000004
all

368.72 --> 373.52000000000004
things that are typically anthroposophic

371.919 --> 376.56
related to that

373.52 --> 377.59999999999997
they're all so incredibly soft and

376.56 --> 378.4
gentle

377.6 --> 381.03900000000004
like

378.4 --> 382.63899999999995
really seriously and it is kind of weird

381.039 --> 384.639
in a way

382.639 --> 386.319
to me it was almost like too soft like

384.639 --> 389.199
they're too softy and that is something

386.319 --> 392.08000000000004
that is yeah it's a young man

389.199 --> 393.84000000000003
you know with manly pride and

392.08 --> 397.44
i want to be man

393.84 --> 397.44
yeah that that's not very cool

398.88 --> 401.84
so

400.08 --> 404.08
and also there was a bit of a problem

401.84 --> 406.479
with the more generalized hippie culture

404.08 --> 409.44
as well it's like yeah it's

406.479 --> 412.56
too softy

409.44 --> 415.039
but at at the same time there is

412.56 --> 419.36
even for me there is a place and a time

415.039 --> 419.36
for that level of sensitivity as well

419.44 --> 424.24
right so it

420.84 --> 426.23999999999995
anyway yeah i got i got dipped back into

424.24 --> 427.84000000000003
that for a moment yeah like our

426.24 --> 430.0
conversation with him

427.84 --> 430.0
no

435.199 --> 437.84000000000003
and the thing is

437.919 --> 441.75899999999996
from my position there's just things

439.52 --> 444.79999999999995
that i can personally do with it and

441.759 --> 447.12
that culture because i do get it

444.8 --> 448.96000000000004
and i'm also like dipping into the

447.12 --> 451.36
higher teachings

448.96 --> 454.23999999999995
while not being immersed in the culture

451.36 --> 456.47900000000004
from bottom up as it were i haven't been

454.24 --> 458.8
raised in that type of atmosphere all my

456.479 --> 460.8
life it was a certain period

458.8 --> 462.72
i went to that school and i kind of got

460.8 --> 463.68
into it and my parents got kind of into

462.72 --> 464.879
it

463.68 --> 466.879
but

464.879 --> 468.8
it wasn't all of it like after that

466.879 --> 471.68
dropped then

468.8 --> 474.319
things became different

471.68 --> 477.68
and i had a lot of problems like i had

474.319 --> 478.879
super painful serious social problems

477.68 --> 481.28000000000003
there

478.879 --> 482.96000000000004
like i had moments

481.28 --> 485.039
where i would be home and i would be

482.96 --> 487.28
almost catatonic and my parents would be

485.039 --> 489.28
like are you all right yeah yeah yeah

487.28 --> 492.0
and i just would not would be so closed

489.28 --> 493.599
off with because i was so embarrassed

492.0 --> 495.84
about

493.599 --> 496.96
what a shameful position i seem to have

495.84 --> 499.35999999999996
been

496.96 --> 501.44
put into for example by a lot of my

499.36 --> 502.96000000000004
classmates and been publicly embarrassed

501.44 --> 504.0
and didn't know how to respond to that

502.96 --> 505.28
[ __ ]

504.0 --> 507.52
you know

505.28 --> 509.75899999999996
and that is also because i went through

507.52 --> 511.35999999999996
such a rough time

509.759 --> 513.599
that also made me kind of like yeah i

511.36 --> 515.599
don't want that anymore

513.599 --> 519.44
because of the personal experiences that

515.599 --> 519.44
i had it was too rough on me in a way

519.519 --> 523.36
but under yeah at the same time i was in

522.399 --> 524.32
a period

523.36 --> 526.16
teen

524.32 --> 527.6
being a teen

526.16 --> 531.1999999999999
preteen bit

527.6 --> 533.519
and i was very rough on myself so

531.2 --> 536.8000000000001
anyway

533.519 --> 539.12
but i i do get it i do get what they are

536.8 --> 539.12
like

540.16 --> 545.04
and in a way yes i understand and i

542.48 --> 546.24
encouraging it i do encourage it there's

545.04 --> 548.48
not real

546.24 --> 550.16
harm in it although look and this is

548.48 --> 551.76
something that rudel steiner teaches

550.16 --> 553.92
also is that there's always this

551.76 --> 556.56
delicate balance and if you're gonna

553.92 --> 559.1999999999999
fill everything with light

556.56 --> 561.5189999999999
around you and positivity and soft

559.2 --> 564.6400000000001
softness then

561.519 --> 566.64
the darkness will still try to slip in

564.64 --> 570.3199999999999
through other routes

566.64 --> 572.399
into your personal behavior for example

570.32 --> 574.48
so yeah root of steiner's message was

572.399 --> 576.399
basically always be on your guard

574.48 --> 578.399
especially concerning yourself on what

576.399 --> 580.399
you do

578.399 --> 582.72
and mistakes you know everybody makes

580.399 --> 585.839
mistake constantly like our very

582.72 --> 587.9200000000001
development rests on making mistakes

585.839 --> 590.399
fundamentally practically

587.92 --> 593.1999999999999
but doesn't mean that you're gonna yeah

590.399 --> 595.2
a mistake is is only effective to

593.2 --> 596.8000000000001
develop from if you

595.2 --> 599.44
get over it

596.8 --> 601.04
that's the trick

599.44 --> 602.8000000000001
just because the mistake has been made

601.04 --> 605.5999999999999
doesn't mean that you're gonna learn

602.8 --> 608.079
from it no that's the decision you have

605.6 --> 610.32
to make when you figure out that it is a

608.079 --> 612.7199999999999
mistake and sometimes a very tough

610.32 --> 615.36
choice for people that's where lucifer

612.72 --> 617.6
comes in and seduces you to bypass

615.36 --> 619.839
reality and pretend

617.6 --> 621.519
like it's not a mistake like no there is

619.839 --> 623.44
some purpose to it

621.519 --> 624.48
even though all signs say it is a

623.44 --> 627.36
mistake

624.48 --> 629.36
and you bypass it

627.36 --> 632.32
that's lucifer that's a spirit of loser

629.36 --> 634.72
not some entity that's the seduction

632.32 --> 636.0
energy that is part of

634.72 --> 638.64
human

636.0 --> 641.04
nature we have to deal with that all our

638.64 --> 641.04
lives

641.68 --> 644.68
right

648.21 --> 655.519
[Music]

650.88 --> 655.519
lucy effect fire no

656.48 --> 662.24
no but it yeah this lucifer is esoteric

659.36 --> 665.44
it's the esoteric lucifer

662.24 --> 667.36
it's not ascribed to even a specific

665.44 --> 669.6
entity

667.36 --> 672.16
although there are and this is where

669.6 --> 676.0790000000001
things get really weird out there in

672.16 --> 677.68
in what my healer deals with it's

676.079 --> 679.3599999999999
there are like

677.68 --> 682.2399999999999
non-human spirits out there that are

679.36 --> 682.24
literally not

682.399 --> 688.399
approaching you from another person

686.16 --> 690.88
and those those are the ones eventually

688.399 --> 694.48
that try to become part of you in order

690.88 --> 697.92
to meddle with others through you

694.48 --> 701.6800000000001
and they kind of land your abilities

697.92 --> 704.4799999999999
but they are not lucifer lucifer is in

701.68 --> 706.399
the in the proposed setup is more about

704.48 --> 708.399
the frequency it is all about the

706.399 --> 710.399
frequency of it all and

708.399 --> 712.88
the best frequency is the frequency of

710.399 --> 714.839
christ it's the middle path

712.88 --> 716.8
not the middle path as in

714.839 --> 719.6800000000001
a what is it

716.8 --> 721.519
a lesser of two evils no

719.68 --> 723.519
it is

721.519 --> 726.5600000000001
just not

723.519 --> 730.24
finding a middle another way basically

726.56 --> 732.2399999999999
ascending above a earthly conflict

730.24 --> 734.8
finding another way that's kind of the

732.24 --> 736.72
christ way it's the ascending

734.8 --> 739.76
overcoming the problem

736.72 --> 741.0400000000001
not by taking a lesser of two evils that

739.76 --> 744.399
is like

741.04 --> 746.639
yeah it's much sought-after moments for

744.399 --> 747.44
individuals

746.639 --> 749.76
and

747.44 --> 751.6800000000001
the yeah the christ

749.76 --> 753.68
frequency

751.68 --> 756.0
helps that

753.68 --> 759.3599999999999
and yeah if you stray from the path from

756.0 --> 761.839
that frequency it will be through arimon

759.36 --> 763.76
or it will be through lucifer and

761.839 --> 766.48
and they work hand in hand

763.76 --> 768.56
so lucifer seduces you it is in your

766.48 --> 771.2
nature to be seduced

768.56 --> 773.3599999999999
to think of yourself more than others

771.2 --> 775.2
for example in a way or even just in a

773.36 --> 778.72
moment you know it doesn't have to be a

775.2 --> 780.0790000000001
conscious thing it could be a pure feel

778.72 --> 783.36
thing like me

780.079 --> 785.04
no i am better and in a way that doesn't

783.36 --> 787.04
mean that you can't basically size

785.04 --> 788.959
yourself your qualities up and compare

787.04 --> 790.88
them to others and say look i'm better

788.959 --> 792.4799999999999
at this than this person

790.88 --> 793.76
that's not the same

792.48 --> 795.6800000000001
so when your

793.76 --> 797.36
inner feelings in your heart and your

795.68 --> 798.56
ego your

797.36 --> 801.04
your me

798.56 --> 803.76
your social position tells you no you

801.04 --> 806.3199999999999
are worth more than the other you're on

803.76 --> 809.36
another scale that's another process a

806.32 --> 812.0790000000001
sizing up value of content of somebody

809.36 --> 815.519
and that is lucifer basically giving you

812.079 --> 818.079
a false idea from the inside it's kind

815.519 --> 820.72
of built into us as part of the social

818.079 --> 822.6389999999999
mechanisms that we have

820.72 --> 825.519
and it's a luciferian

822.639 --> 826.9590000000001
spirit that seduces you metaphorically

825.519 --> 830.079
esoterically

826.959 --> 832.6389999999999
so an ironman is the

830.079 --> 835.12
a seeming counter opposite it is the it

832.639 --> 837.279
is not a subduction it is more like

835.12 --> 839.519
giving up it is depression it is

837.279 --> 842.88
destroying things ending it's the end it

839.519 --> 845.44
is like the final end and there lies a

842.88 --> 847.519
philosophical bizarre thing as well

845.44 --> 849.519
because technically everyone in the end

847.519 --> 852.5600000000001
only always wins but

849.519 --> 852.5600000000001
as life goes

852.88 --> 856.399
yeah and

854.24 --> 858.16
when you look at the way i just put

856.399 --> 862.16
these things down the middle path right

858.16 --> 865.92
christ the the way out the ascension the

862.16 --> 867.6
the end and the the disrupter the

865.92 --> 870.399
seducer the

867.6 --> 873.519
the delusion

870.399 --> 875.04
it kind of almost feels trinity like not

873.519 --> 877.92
saying that it is

875.04 --> 878.959
but and it also reminds me a little of

877.92 --> 880.88
the

878.959 --> 882.8389999999999
hindu

880.88 --> 887.36
try like the

882.839 --> 889.839
creator the destroyer and the maintainer

887.36 --> 892.48
it i don't know maybe it's just the

889.839 --> 892.48
three thing

893.839 --> 897.839
but

895.199 --> 901.519
it's fascinating how it's seemingly

897.839 --> 904.9000000000001
resonates at least on the on the surface

901.519 --> 906.639
no arie man

904.9 --> 909.199
[Music]

906.639 --> 911.279
it's yeah i know it's not a family i

909.199 --> 914.7199999999999
think it is something that

911.279 --> 916.32
rudolf steiner basically

914.72 --> 918.48
gave it that name

916.32 --> 921.519
or although there may be some more

918.48 --> 923.9200000000001
complex pretty

921.519 --> 926.48
like obscured roots

923.92 --> 928.639
spiritually like through i don't know

926.48 --> 930.72
germanic traditions where it was lent

928.639 --> 933.279
from something i don't know exactly the

930.72 --> 936.48
origin of the word arimon

933.279 --> 936.48
just spell it like this

937.05 --> 941.7199999999999
[Music]

938.56 --> 941.7199999999999
i think

944.639 --> 952.0
i should double check that

948.54 --> 952.0
[Music]

955.92 --> 958.24
yes

961.759 --> 965.839
yeah i got it right

963.44 --> 970.0790000000001
it's fascinating

965.839 --> 972.9590000000001
and also if you think about the iron man

970.079 --> 975.279
it also reminds a lot just that spirit

972.959 --> 978.8
is very much

975.279 --> 982.399
what kind of the the new reborn idea

978.8 --> 985.4399999999999
through alternative sources of the the

982.399 --> 988.72
phoenicians are the phoenicians are very

985.44 --> 989.839
aromantic in nature they

988.72 --> 992.639
they're

989.839 --> 994.399
all about that all about the end and

992.639 --> 997.36
ending things and

994.399 --> 999.839
and control through ending

997.36 --> 1001.6800000000001
it's it creepy as [ __ ]

999.839 --> 1004.9590000000001
but

1001.68 --> 1008.3199999999999
i don't know if i don't know how far

1004.959 --> 1011.5189999999999
rudolf steiner even went as to correlate

1008.32 --> 1013.9200000000001
this concept with historical issues but

1011.519 --> 1015.44
i could imagine that it's quite easy to

1013.92 --> 1016.7199999999999
do because it is

1015.44 --> 1019.519
very

1016.72 --> 1019.519
refined

1020.639 --> 1024.36
spiritual model

1026.559 --> 1033.36
anyway yeah you can look for this stuff

1030.799 --> 1033.36
what's this

1034.079 --> 1038.52
all right

1035.52 --> 1038.52
yeah

1039.439 --> 1042.799
here's a link

1040.88 --> 1046.959
in chat for anyone just

1042.799 --> 1046.959
it's an online thing you can read

1051.84 --> 1056.8799999999999
there's more of these there's like all

1053.6 --> 1056.8799999999999
of these like pages

1063.919 --> 1067.76
and yeah anyway

1065.679 --> 1069.52
there is a lot more of this stuff out

1067.76 --> 1074.24
there it's just that

1069.52 --> 1076.559
i'm pretty damn damn certain that

1074.24 --> 1079.039
the elite the controllers the ones that

1076.559 --> 1081.76
really program the

1079.039 --> 1083.84
the outlets in a way

1081.76 --> 1085.679
and that are controlling even well

1083.84 --> 1088.72
google probably

1085.679 --> 1090.96
that they just completely censor them in

1088.72 --> 1092.799
the sense that they never

1090.96 --> 1094.32
let it leak through to anyone if

1092.799 --> 1095.9189999999999
somebody's gonna search for it they'll

1094.32 --> 1097.6
probably find it

1095.919 --> 1100.24
but they never

1097.6 --> 1102.6399999999999
never suggest it never

1100.24 --> 1104.16
i've never seen it suggested before i

1102.64 --> 1105.44
started looking and even when i start

1104.16 --> 1107.76
looking into it

1105.44 --> 1110.96
eventually it drops off

1107.76 --> 1112.799
the results and suggestions very quickly

1110.96 --> 1114.799
very very quickly

1112.799 --> 1116.72
so just noticing that

1114.799 --> 1120.6399999999999
so if you think that's just flat earth

1116.72 --> 1123.039
well no this guy and and the teachings

1120.64 --> 1125.1200000000001
is huge preponderance of writings that

1123.039 --> 1127.52
he didn't like great insane amount of

1125.12 --> 1129.6789999999999
books i'll i'd never

1127.52 --> 1132.0
i'd never get like that

1129.679 --> 1134.3200000000002
i'm not i'm not much of a

1132.0 --> 1137.84
book guy anyway i'm much more about the

1134.32 --> 1137.84
verbal traditions

1140.559 --> 1146.3999999999999
but yeah this is something that every

1143.2 --> 1148.24
time i bring something up relating to it

1146.4 --> 1149.6000000000001
i don't hear a lot back about it

1148.24 --> 1151.36
although

1149.6 --> 1154.08
i think i guess in the netherlands

1151.36 --> 1157.039
especially maybe in germany a little

1154.08 --> 1158.72
it is kind of known that it exists and

1157.039 --> 1161.039
people do come out like oh yeah i went

1158.72 --> 1162.4
to a school like that no oh yeah that's

1161.039 --> 1164.32
kind of funny

1162.4 --> 1165.039
and oh yeah they are kind of soft in a

1164.32 --> 1168.1599999999999
way

1165.039 --> 1170.799
that so but other than that

1168.16 --> 1173.3600000000001
seems like very

1170.799 --> 1174.32
not to the foreground and has good

1173.36 --> 1175.76
reason

1174.32 --> 1177.12
too because

1175.76 --> 1180.32
these people

1177.12 --> 1183.28
get a lot of trouble from the system

1180.32 --> 1184.799
they really have to defend their culture

1183.28 --> 1188.32
in a way

1184.799 --> 1189.36
very carefully because

1188.32 --> 1190.559
they get

1189.36 --> 1193.12
like

1190.559 --> 1195.52
lawsuit issues

1193.12 --> 1197.28
like people are really all looking on

1195.52 --> 1198.4
their fingers if they're doing something

1197.28 --> 1200.0
wrong

1198.4 --> 1200.96
there's there's like lawyers out there

1200.0 --> 1202.08
that do

1200.96 --> 1203.76
they are

1202.08 --> 1207.52
they have been barraged pretty much

1203.76 --> 1209.44
since they came into being

1207.52 --> 1211.039
so i just wanted to put a little

1209.44 --> 1213.44
attention on that

1211.039 --> 1216.4
that yeah there is this thing out there

1213.44 --> 1217.3600000000001
and it's just kind of overlooked

1216.4 --> 1220.64
but

1217.36 --> 1223.4399999999998
there is a lot of value in there in a

1220.64 --> 1223.44
positive way

1229.2 --> 1234.02
yeah anyway

1230.79 --> 1234.02
[Music]

1236.08 --> 1241.1999999999998
love steiner's take on the anti-chambers

1239.44 --> 1244.0
birth and death

1241.2 --> 1244.0
oh huh

1244.24 --> 1248.039
i haven't read that

1254.72 --> 1260.6000000000001
what

1255.919 --> 1260.6000000000001
what does that mean gideon's sick

1274.08 --> 1278.799
anyway yeah did i go through chat

1277.679 --> 1282.0
already

1278.799 --> 1284.32
i i think i completely forgot about it

1282.0 --> 1286.799
let's go through chad

1284.32 --> 1288.72
i've got 40 watching anyway most people

1286.799 --> 1291.84
are just probably going to be listening

1288.72 --> 1295.52
to me that's it because this is all just

1291.84 --> 1295.52
pretty like what i know

1296.32 --> 1301.6789999999999
like even when i listen

1299.36 --> 1303.76
to people that are like my healer who is

1301.679 --> 1306.48
into this culture as well when they

1303.76 --> 1310.559
really get into the deeper

1306.48 --> 1310.559
cultural because they have their own

1310.96 --> 1314.64
well not literally but their own kind of

1312.799 --> 1317.6
slang their own

1314.64 --> 1319.44
cult it it's they have a lot of detail

1317.6 --> 1322.08
in there that's like their thing their

1319.44 --> 1324.3200000000002
way of thinking and speaking almost it's

1322.08 --> 1326.1589999999999
pretty fascinating and it is not it's

1324.32 --> 1328.32
not delusional

1326.159 --> 1330.0
it's just more ethereal sometimes if

1328.32 --> 1333.2
it's yeah and

1330.0 --> 1334.96
every when my healer then gets into

1333.2 --> 1337.44
something more intricate and he starts

1334.96 --> 1339.52
really using that type of thing and

1337.44 --> 1341.1200000000001
speak and he doesn't often do that

1339.52 --> 1342.32
sometimes there's just no other way to

1341.12 --> 1343.4399999999998
explain it

1342.32 --> 1345.4399999999998
for him

1343.44 --> 1348.3200000000002
and then it's like wow

1345.44 --> 1348.3200000000002
i get like the

1349.679 --> 1354.48
like the cough

1351.2 --> 1356.559
that cultural flare on it for a moment

1354.48 --> 1359.559
it's just fascinating how it works

1356.559 --> 1359.559
anyway

1361.84 --> 1365.12
yes gideon sick

1366.0 --> 1369.039
right

1366.96 --> 1371.28
yeah well i

1369.039 --> 1372.24
have experienced that kind of back that

1371.28 --> 1375.559
up

1372.24 --> 1375.559
in a way

1377.36 --> 1381.36
and i really and there's more people

1379.36 --> 1383.52
people that i know

1381.36 --> 1384.559
that haven't

1383.52 --> 1388.6399999999999
been

1384.559 --> 1390.08
raised in enterprise schools or anything

1388.64 --> 1392.96
but

1390.08 --> 1395.52
that believed that kind of naturally by

1392.96 --> 1397.3600000000001
themselves and they like yeah i believe

1395.52 --> 1399.6
that and

1397.36 --> 1401.039
and they noticed just elements about it

1399.6 --> 1402.799
when they had yeah

1401.039 --> 1405.84
for example

1402.799 --> 1407.679
my friend over in naimei

1405.84 --> 1409.12
who has a kid

1407.679 --> 1410.48
young kid

1409.12 --> 1413.52
and she

1410.48 --> 1415.679
leaves like that as well and she talks

1413.52 --> 1418.1589999999999
about it and i've heard many other women

1415.679 --> 1420.4
talk about that aren't necessarily

1418.159 --> 1422.72
raised with that culture specifically

1420.4 --> 1426.88
and so it is almost

1422.72 --> 1429.6000000000001
natural and i do believe that indeed

1426.88 --> 1431.3600000000001
kids choose their parents they are like

1429.6 --> 1433.1999999999998
summoned

1431.36 --> 1436.08
and but it's

1433.2 --> 1436.0800000000002
yeah they choose

1442.0 --> 1446.799
and hey when they then

1444.48 --> 1449.1200000000001
get in that life then at certain points

1446.799 --> 1449.9189999999999
in their life they're gonna be

1449.12 --> 1451.36
like

1449.919 --> 1453.3600000000001
like why

1451.36 --> 1454.8799999999999
why am i going through this because

1453.36 --> 1457.279
they're going through something really

1454.88 --> 1458.88
shitty and then maybe they'll be really

1457.279 --> 1461.2
disappointed for example in their

1458.88 --> 1463.279
parents in certain moments or

1461.2 --> 1466.559
something bad and they'll be like

1463.279 --> 1467.679
why why is this overcoming me

1466.559 --> 1469.84
well

1467.679 --> 1473.039
that's kind of the challenge that they

1469.84 --> 1474.799
took and when they chose they knew all

1473.039 --> 1478.1589999999999
of that

1474.799 --> 1482.48
or they saw it and they thought

1478.159 --> 1482.48
well the good moments are just worth it

1482.64 --> 1488.0800000000002
and it's all about figuring that out

1486.24 --> 1490.48
in the actual conscious experience and

1488.08 --> 1493.6789999999999

yeah now i'm kind of embarrassed there

1506.4 --> 1510.24
seems to be people knowing a lot more

1508.159 --> 1511.6000000000001
about this in my chat than me this is

1510.24 --> 1514.6

1893.76 --> 1898.08
two minutes

1895.44 --> 1899.8400000000001
25 seconds

1898.08 --> 1902.559

1962.72 --> 1966.6000000000001
damn it hold on

1980.48 --> 1983.84
all right

1981.519 --> 1985.36
there we go

1983.84 --> 1986.9599999999998
work sardines

1985.36 --> 1988.6399999999999
now we can see things way way further

1986.96 --> 1990.3990000000001
it's a wonderful working done by nathan

1988.64 --> 1992.96
oakley and some uk teams where they're

1990.399 --> 1997.32
actually seeing a horizon behind oil

1992.96 --> 1997.32
platforms at 10 15 20.

2012.88 --> 2017.44
a massive congratulations to

2015.76 --> 2020.08
national geographic mark sergeant

2017.44 --> 2022.559
patricia steer and all of the team out

2020.08 --> 2025.4399999999998
at the lake trying to prove the earth is

2022.559 --> 2028.08
a sphere and inadvertently capturing a

2025.44 --> 2030.159
rather excellent black swan so these

2028.08 --> 2032.32
guys went down to the lake obviously

2030.159 --> 2034.0800000000002
trying to prove the physical geometry of

2032.32 --> 2036.32
the earth curve obstruction we know as a

2034.08 --> 2038.6399999999999
geometric horizon in their model and

2036.32 --> 2040.399
they unfortunately filmed something they

2038.64 --> 2041.919
weren't expecting unfortunately they

2040.399 --> 2044.2399999999998
don't give us the exact mass for where

2041.919 --> 2046.0
they claim these stripes on this board

2044.24 --> 2047.679
are actually being obscured by what they

2046.0 --> 2049.28
claim is the curve of the earth when

2047.679 --> 2051.04
they reach the most limited angle and

2049.28 --> 2054.8
seem to have compression

2051.04 --> 2056.399
they also have a horizon directly behind

2054.8 --> 2058.32
the actual claim of earth curve

2056.399 --> 2059.919
obstruction in the near foreground

2058.32 --> 2062.0
despite the fact that the horizon that

2059.919 --> 2064.6389999999997
should be obscuring it is actually

2062.0 --> 2065.76
behind it so this is a rather excellent

2064.639 --> 2068.48
capture

2065.76 --> 2070.8790000000004
of a black swan another congratulations

2068.48 --> 2072.48
to national geographic mark sergeant and

2070.879 --> 2074.3199999999997
all the guys who didn't even realize

2072.48 --> 2077.2

you're right

2190.0 --> 2194.92
yeah i did put it on mute i forgot

2205.52 --> 2211.04
no i wasn't reading anything specific i

2208.16 --> 2211.04
was just saying that

2211.76 --> 2219.32
that yeah that shout out was pretty cool

2215.839 --> 2219.32
from eddie bravo

2231.119 --> 2236.56
yeah and hey nathan oakley you know

2234.48 --> 2238.2400000000002
i've been there for a while

2236.56 --> 2238.96
on the debates and it's a good place

2238.24 --> 2241.2
it's

2238.96 --> 2243.359
yeah it's very informative it's very

2241.2 --> 2244.7999999999997
clear it's very

2243.359 --> 2247.359
exact

2244.8 --> 2249.599
and persistent and good elements and i

2247.359 --> 2252.0789999999997
think it's just getting the momentum

2249.599 --> 2254.1600000000003
that it really deserves it's like

2252.079 --> 2256.4
keeping the same form and then

2254.16 --> 2258.16
eventually things start oscillating and

2256.4 --> 2261.44
then resonating into the world and

2258.16 --> 2264.839
people out there are recognizing it

2261.44 --> 2264.839
and yeah

2275.28 --> 2279.3590000000004
so yeah nathan oakley is ace

2279.68 --> 2282.56
i totally agree

2283.359 --> 2287.92
subscribe to him now

2285.839 --> 2289.599
because he's not chilling enough for

2287.92 --> 2291.28

2289.599 --> 2294.96

2349.68 --> 2355.0789999999997
and hey thanks for letting me be part of

2351.92 --> 2355.079
the show

2356.64 --> 2360.3199999999997
you know being there does inspire me

2358.72 --> 2362.9599999999996
also and

2360.32 --> 2362.96
i know it's

2363.28 --> 2368.32
it's a good place to hang around and

2365.44 --> 2370.4
where thoughts can get pretty sharp and

2368.32 --> 2372.56
seen and i like that

2370.4 --> 2372.56
so

2372.64 --> 2377.5989999999997
yeah i've definitely

2374.88 --> 2380.48
reaped my benefits from the show as well

2377.599 --> 2382.48
and i'm glad to be a part of it

2380.48 --> 2386.079
and yeah of course there's ups and down

2382.48 --> 2389.599
moments in uh as all individually

2386.079 --> 2392.7200000000003
and in the social setup situation

2389.599 --> 2393.839
but yeah we're all taking what we do

2392.72 --> 2396.72
serious

2393.839 --> 2398.16
and making sure that we can move forward

2396.72 --> 2400.56
in some way

2398.16 --> 2402.16
and you don't take each other too

2400.56 --> 2404.64
lightly and that's

2402.16 --> 2408.7999999999997
you take other people serious for for

2404.64 --> 2408.7999999999997
what they are really doing as well

2408.88 --> 2413.92
and yeah that's good

2411.599 --> 2417.28
i appreciate that

2413.92 --> 2419.359
it gives me more room to grow as well

2417.28 --> 2421.3590000000004
in my own development and my own ideas

2419.359 --> 2425.48
and what i'm

2421.359 --> 2425.48
deciding on putting forward

2428.56 --> 2432.64
yeah

2430.4 --> 2434.1600000000003
oh that's just logical the more you're

2432.64 --> 2436.96
surrounded

2434.16 --> 2440.319
the more you will truth the more the

2436.96 --> 2444.359
moths will be drawn to the flame

2440.319 --> 2444.359
and start cluttering you

2454.96 --> 2460.2400000000002
and some of them are very big and they

2458.079 --> 2463.44
keep coming back and you set them aflame

2460.24 --> 2464.64
but they just keep on coming back

2463.44 --> 2466.7200000000003
you know

2464.64 --> 2469.359
they're like professional straw man

2466.72 --> 2473.5989999999997
crafters that have made the crafting of

2469.359 --> 2473.5989999999997
straw man into a precise art

2491.27 --> 2496.319
[Music]

2494.0 --> 2500.72
right and in a way you could say it is

2496.319 --> 2501.599
also a great opportunity to expose

2500.72 --> 2505.04
a

2501.599 --> 2507.76
somewhat before concealed part

2505.04 --> 2510.16
of human nature and just reveal how it

2507.76 --> 2512.5600000000004
works what happens

2510.16 --> 2514.24
at taco yeah give it a bit more

2512.56 --> 2516.64
direction for people to understand

2514.24 --> 2518.8799999999997
what's going on so they can

2516.64 --> 2520.319
spot it themselves and all that so in a

2518.88 --> 2523.28
way we're like

2520.319 --> 2524.24
exposing a piece publicly and hey these

2523.28 --> 2526.079
people

2524.24 --> 2528.8799999999997
are all par they do it

2526.079 --> 2530.4
they go alive and get subjected to

2528.88 --> 2532.319
everything they get subjected to and

2530.4 --> 2534.079
they do everything they do

2532.319 --> 2536.079
it's their choice

2534.079 --> 2537.52
you know whether that's like compulsive

2536.079 --> 2540.2400000000002
psychologically

2537.52 --> 2541.7599999999998
deranged that they keep on doing it

2540.24 --> 2544.56
that's

2541.76 --> 2547.599
but that's their personal life issue if

2544.56 --> 2549.04
hey if they truly realize like what have

2547.599 --> 2551.3590000000004
i done

2549.04 --> 2553.599
then they could potentially technically

2551.359 --> 2556.4
choose to step away but they don't

2553.599 --> 2558.319
really want to and to be fair in a way

2556.4 --> 2561.359
flat earthers don't really want them to

2558.319 --> 2563.7599999999998
do that either because it is

2561.359 --> 2567.04
fascinating to see them

2563.76 --> 2568.88
struggle to defend their religion

2567.04 --> 2570.0
and it just reveals a lot about human

2568.88 --> 2572.2400000000002
nature

2570.0 --> 2578.04
and tricks that are in there that people

2572.24 --> 2578.04
have and to learn from it all of us

2581.28 --> 2586.3190000000004
and as more of us learn and start to see

2584.319 --> 2588.64
more and more refined more sharpness

2586.319 --> 2591.599
into this image around us

2588.64 --> 2593.68
the energy of what people do

2591.599 --> 2597.28
also the more flaws

2593.68 --> 2600.64
will be exposed

2597.28 --> 2601.8390000000004
of individuals themselves that are even

2600.64 --> 2603.5989999999997
part of

2601.839 --> 2606.16
the truthers

2603.599 --> 2609.2000000000003
and they will be forced to deal with it

2606.16 --> 2611.04
will they double down on their

2609.2 --> 2613.7599999999998
concealment what they're hiding from

2611.04 --> 2617.359
themselves in time trying to portray to

2613.76 --> 2619.599
the world or are they going to

2617.359 --> 2622.56
get over it and it's one of the toughest

2619.599 --> 2623.6800000000003
things in the world especially if you're

2622.56 --> 2625.68
you've kind of

2623.68 --> 2627.7599999999998
rearranged yourself to be in a certain

2625.68 --> 2631.2799999999997
way to uphold something i know all about

2627.76 --> 2632.8390000000004
it in a way i'm doing it myself

2631.28 --> 2635.6800000000003
and i've explained

2632.839 --> 2638.48
this but if you don't get over these

2635.68 --> 2640.16
obstacles then the more

2638.48 --> 2642.4
the light will shine the more people

2640.16 --> 2644.0789999999997
will start to understand psychology and

2642.4 --> 2646.56
how people cover up things and make

2644.079 --> 2649.76
mistakes and cover for them

2646.56 --> 2652.72
the more yeah people's errors will

2649.76 --> 2655.28
become exposed and they must deal with

2652.72 --> 2657.4399999999996
it one way or the other they can turn to

2655.28 --> 2658.4
the darkness into more denial and more

2657.44 --> 2660.4
deceit

2658.4 --> 2663.28
or they can

2660.4 --> 2665.599
let it be what it is and like try to

2663.28 --> 2667.92
heal it and maybe even try to resolve it

2665.599 --> 2671.44
and there is even

2667.92 --> 2674.16
help out there just of the people on the

2671.44 --> 2676.88
net themselves there's just

2674.16 --> 2679.5989999999997
people out there there's

2676.88 --> 2683.359
it is easier than you would imagine

2679.599 --> 2683.3590000000004
having kept everything in

2684.079 --> 2688.2400000000002
so

2685.359 --> 2690.7999999999997
yeah the more we become awake

2688.24 --> 2692.4799999999996
and and teach each other how to see more

2690.8 --> 2694.88
refined more sharp

2692.48 --> 2697.76
and to distinguish the things and when

2694.88 --> 2700.2400000000002
things get personal to notice that to

2697.76 --> 2702.2400000000002
feel that you and then technically point

2700.24 --> 2704.4799999999996
it out but also to feel that is very

2702.24 --> 2707.4399999999996
important to get the census for it then

2704.48 --> 2709.839
eventually yeah people's flaws and

2707.44 --> 2712.48
mistakes and cover-ups for themselves

2709.839 --> 2714.88
will also become more lit upon

2712.48 --> 2717.92
more scrutinized more people will become

2714.88 --> 2720.079
more comfortable honestly scrutinizing

2717.92 --> 2722.079
people for their real flaws

2720.079 --> 2725.04
without necessarily judging them even

2722.079 --> 2726.8
although the savage yes first comes to

2725.04 --> 2728.72
savage

2726.8 --> 2731.119
they figure it out attack attack attack

2728.72 --> 2734.24
attack attack get kick kick him down

2731.119 --> 2735.599
kick him down quickly savannah attack

2734.24 --> 2737.839
very toxic

2735.599 --> 2740.8
but afterwards the people that don't do

2737.839 --> 2743.119
that and they get ignored or safani's

2740.8 --> 2744.8390000000004
and all that they just do their their

2743.119 --> 2748.7200000000003
crap in their own little

2744.839 --> 2750.48
spaces and with people that like that

2748.72 --> 2751.52
and yeah

2750.48 --> 2754.2400000000002
we

2751.52 --> 2756.56
then the people that remain will

2754.24 --> 2759.7599999999998
suddenly be able to

2756.56 --> 2760.7999999999997
deal with it and basically broaden our

2759.76 --> 2763.92
reach

2760.8 --> 2765.76
socially and sense sensibly among one

2763.92 --> 2768.48
another through the internet even though

2765.76 --> 2770.8
some of us may never physically meet

2768.48 --> 2773.04
it it all becomes possible because of

2770.8 --> 2774.8
the consciousness expanding seeing more

2773.04 --> 2777.839
detail

2774.8 --> 2780.079
you figure things out anyway

2777.839 --> 2782.96
yeah my little speech

2780.079 --> 2782.96
about awakening

2783.359 --> 2790.16
and it's real it's absolutely real

2787.119 --> 2792.4
but it also depends on can you get

2790.16 --> 2794.72
onto that level because there's a lot of

2792.4 --> 2795.599
energy going around when you really peak

2794.72 --> 2797.2
there

2795.599 --> 2799.76
can you take

2797.2 --> 2804.56
the storm

2799.76 --> 2804.5600000000004
or will you buckle or blow up or

2805.04 --> 2808.88
and you gotta

2806.56 --> 2811.04
like a tree just grow slowly you know if

2808.88 --> 2815.119
a tree would grow

2811.04 --> 2817.2
50 meters long in in 10 days yeah just

2815.119 --> 2819.76
one little blow of a wind

2817.2 --> 2822.3999999999996
it's gonna break you know this but

2819.76 --> 2823.44
if a tree glows slowly and expands and

2822.4 --> 2826.0
widens

2823.44 --> 2828.0
and the higher it goes the more it feels

2826.0 --> 2830.88
starts to feel slowly because it goes

2828.0 --> 2832.24
slowly and suddenly like the bounce

2830.88 --> 2834.0
and the structural

2832.24 --> 2837.839
integrity gets stronger it gets more

2834.0 --> 2840.4
sturdy so because it grows slowly

2837.839 --> 2842.48
it reaches high and then as because it's

2840.4 --> 2845.359
grown it can take

2842.48 --> 2846.88
all that wind if it just grows in 10

2845.359 --> 2848.16
days all that length it's not going to

2846.88 --> 2849.2000000000003
have that strength and it's going to

2848.16 --> 2851.2
break

2849.2 --> 2854.24
that's kind of the lesson of it of the

2851.2 --> 2855.1189999999997
awakening and that's also why i've

2854.24 --> 2858.64
even

2855.119 --> 2860.8
started out saying no i'm a slow grower

2858.64 --> 2864.48
i need to do slow

2860.8 --> 2864.48
because i take a lot of wind up there

2864.96 --> 2868.8
do you see

2866.24 --> 2871.1189999999997
i have to be sturdy i have to be strong

2868.8 --> 2873.8390000000004
because the winds just get insane up

2871.119 --> 2873.839
there

2874.079 --> 2878.4
so yeah that's metaphorical by the way

2876.16 --> 2881.96
esoterically metaphorical i hope you

2878.4 --> 2881.96
appreciate it

2882.73 --> 2886.38
[Music]

2888.48 --> 2893.04
and this is

2890.0 --> 2894.96
this is basically old folklore in a way

2893.04 --> 2897.2
about the trees the tree metaphor the

2894.96 --> 2899.52
slow growth this is old old old

2897.2 --> 2902.3999999999996
knowledge so we've been with humans

2899.52 --> 2903.68
forever since humans have had have

2902.4 --> 2905.28
had eyes

2903.68 --> 2908.16
to see

2905.28 --> 2910.1600000000003
and live and see trees grow

2908.16 --> 2912.64
they could figure it out and i bet that

2910.16 --> 2914.8799999999997
even in their own way animals have this

2912.64 --> 2915.92
lore as well

2914.88 --> 2918.1600000000003
it's just

2915.92 --> 2920.559
you start to feel it eventually you

2918.16 --> 2922.72
don't need to be super super intelligent

2920.559 --> 2925.3590000000004
to get this

2922.72 --> 2929.839
but you can be very very very distracted

2925.359 --> 2929.839
away from it and not learn the lesson

2938.88 --> 2941.88
right

2945.76 --> 2948.88
leave the juice alone

2949.359 --> 2952.359
this

2960.48 --> 2964.0
cranky anchors what the

2967.599 --> 2972.839
i have no idea what that is more colored

2984.24 --> 2987.4399999999996
okay okay

2988.24 --> 2991.52
oh sorry if i'm slurping too much you

2990.319 --> 2994.71
know

2991.52 --> 2998.21
it's just

2994.71 --> 2998.21
[Music]

2999.76 --> 3005.2000000000003
that's why we got slurp win even though

3001.92 --> 3005.2000000000003
he's banned in this chat

3005.68 --> 3010.48
anyway yeah i've heard some things about

3007.839 --> 3015.359
the adl as well

3010.48 --> 3015.359
they're under some scrutiny i think

3016.0 --> 3018.96
a good servant

3021.839 --> 3026.2799999999997
don't need adl on her ass

3026.64 --> 3029.839
there's some yeah i have barely talked

3028.64 --> 3032.0789999999997
about it

3029.839 --> 3034.319
surprisingly because there was a lot of

3032.079 --> 3035.2000000000003
stuff just going on

3034.319 --> 3038.16
in

3035.2 --> 3038.96
on the alex jones show and

3038.16 --> 3041.2799999999997
on

3038.96 --> 3043.68
owen benjamin i think

3041.28 --> 3044.8
i think i saw that right

3043.68 --> 3046.96
it's just

3044.8 --> 3050.079
yeah i've been kind of up there with my

3046.96 --> 3051.839
mind so every time they touch upon

3050.079 --> 3054.079
the bigger thing as well but then it

3051.839 --> 3057.04
kind of eventually blurs up and it's

3054.079 --> 3059.3590000000004
like what actually happened during that

3057.04 --> 3061.839
show i don't remember the details again

3059.359 --> 3064.4
i just remember it was good and then of

3061.839 --> 3066.0789999999997
course if i see a fragment of it

3064.4 --> 3068.2400000000002
and unfortunately i can't because it's

3066.079 --> 3070.079
on d live but if i see a fragment of it

3068.24 --> 3072.24
then i'll instantly be reminded of

3070.079 --> 3074.88
everything probably that's usually how

3072.24 --> 3074.8799999999997
it works for me

3076.16 --> 3079.99
but

3077.599 --> 3083.0800000000004
yeah

3079.99 --> 3083.08
[Music]

3083.2 --> 3087.8799999999997
it's just a lot of movement

3109.28 --> 3112.09
right

3111.52 --> 3113.44
also

3112.09 --> 3114.6400000000003
[Music]

3113.44 --> 3117.04
yeah

3114.64 --> 3117.04
i don't know

3118.8 --> 3123.2000000000003
there's this weird situation going on

3120.96 --> 3125.2
and it seems all very politically

3123.2 --> 3127.5989999999997
theatrical in a way

3125.2 --> 3130.319
but i wonder sometimes and that's

3127.599 --> 3132.8
this yeah the roger stone guy

3130.319 --> 3134.72
you know and he's been i've i've been

3132.8 --> 3137.6800000000003
watching i watch the alex jones show

3134.72 --> 3139.839
when he was on there and

3137.68 --> 3139.839
yeah

3140.0 --> 3144.72
like from what i could see he's not a

3142.079 --> 3147.04
bad guy at all

3144.72 --> 3149.7599999999998
and but there's just this weird

3147.04 --> 3151.839
entanglements and stuff and

3149.76 --> 3154.0
i don't i don't know too much about him

3151.839 --> 3155.44
to be fair except for what i've for what

3154.0 --> 3157.359
he's shown and

3155.44 --> 3159.76
and he's apparent yeah he's getting this

3157.359 --> 3161.839
full barrage thing

3159.76 --> 3163.76
although i seem

3161.839 --> 3164.839
roger's doing this yeah so it's it's

3163.76 --> 3168.1600000000003
being

3164.839 --> 3170.319
so put up there it that's makes it feel

3168.16 --> 3172.64
so theatrical

3170.319 --> 3174.8
but i do cut and it's also the reason

3172.64 --> 3177.68
why i kind of don't mention it too much

3174.8 --> 3179.92
because it just feels like i'm

3177.68 --> 3182.16
playing into theatrics and i don't

3179.92 --> 3185.28
really want that it seems sort of

3182.16 --> 3189.68
superfluous but it has to be said

3185.28 --> 3189.6800000000003
master of manipulation really

3190.48 --> 3194.96
or maybe he is a bit of a player but he

3192.559 --> 3198.48
doesn't seem like a bad guy

3194.96 --> 3200.4
and i just thought it needed to be said

3198.48 --> 3203.2
like

3200.4 --> 3206.1600000000003
yeah it should just be

3203.2 --> 3206.16
released it's all

3206.839 --> 3212.16
nonsense and i think that there's some

3209.839 --> 3216.0
signs that trump is doing something

3212.16 --> 3216.0
about it oh god and now i said it

3217.92 --> 3222.559
so it's just gonna it's all gonna it

3220.88 --> 3224.1600000000003
seems like it's getting resolved

3222.559 --> 3226.3190000000004
eventually and

3224.16 --> 3229.5989999999997
i think that originally trump that this

3226.319 --> 3232.5589999999997
is what i heard is that trump wanted to

3229.599 --> 3234.6400000000003
see if the system would do as it's

3232.559 --> 3238.3190000000004
supposed to do

3234.64 --> 3238.319
to make it be like a test

3239.2 --> 3243.5989999999997
to the to the judicial system

3241.92 --> 3245.359
if they would handle it properly i don't

3243.599 --> 3247.92
know so

3245.359 --> 3248.96
highest paid actor ever

3247.92 --> 3252.319
okay

3248.96 --> 3252.319
okay could be

3253.599 --> 3258.1600000000003
it is kind of weird i admit it it all of

3256.319 --> 3260.319
it

3258.16 --> 3263.2
does it seems

3260.319 --> 3265.04
overblown but at the same time yeah if

3263.2 --> 3267.359
it wasn't let's presuppose that

3265.04 --> 3269.52
everything about that is real then yeah

3267.359 --> 3272.16
it's plenty obvious to say that yeah of

3269.52 --> 3274.559
course the guy should be released

3272.16 --> 3277.5589999999997
based on the information we've

3274.559 --> 3277.559
received

3279.76 --> 3284.0
so

3280.799 --> 3287.599
that's it that's pretty much it and

3284.0 --> 3288.96
yeah and the adl was talked about again

3287.599 --> 3291.44
indeed

3288.96 --> 3293.44
it was odd because alex jones even kind

3291.44 --> 3296.319
of

3293.44 --> 3298.4
defended them in a way that was kind of

3296.319 --> 3300.64
eloquent saying that like yeah at first

3298.4 --> 3301.92
they may have started out as pretty

3300.64 --> 3304.0
noble

3301.92 --> 3306.0
really trying to do the best but then

3304.0 --> 3307.68
they've become politicized that is

3306.0 --> 3309.2
technically what happened so alex just

3307.68 --> 3310.72
completely right even though there's

3309.2 --> 3313.5989999999997
some more

3310.72 --> 3316.319
complex issues concerning

3313.599 --> 3319.04
israeli influences for example

3316.319 --> 3322.48
as we all know

3319.04 --> 3324.16
but yeah it is getting

3322.48 --> 3325.04
it seems like there's going to just be

3324.16 --> 3327.359
some

3325.04 --> 3329.359
move at trying to fix

3327.359 --> 3332.839
situations

3329.359 --> 3332.839
in a good way

3335.52 --> 3338.72
from the

3336.64 --> 3339.52
trump administration i guess you could

3338.72 --> 3342.48
say

3339.52 --> 3345.7599999999998
also they brought for their new

3342.48 --> 3345.76
what did they call it again

3346.96 --> 3352.319
they echoed that on like a new judge guy

3350.48 --> 3354.2400000000002
that was

3352.319 --> 3356.4
they called it something very specific

3354.24 --> 3359.6899999999996
not pro-trump but a

3356.4 --> 3360.88
trump sympathizer or what's today

3359.69 --> 3362.96
[Music]

3360.88 --> 3365.04
yeah but apparently this guy just seems

3362.96 --> 3367.44
like he's yeah it's fine

3365.04 --> 3370.079
that's a good spark to him

3367.44 --> 3372.4
doesn't seem too polluted to me on

3370.079 --> 3373.52
preliminary i don't know in the long run

3372.4 --> 3375.6800000000003
you know but

3373.52 --> 3379.119
so

3375.68 --> 3379.1189999999997
it seems like there's some

3379.28 --> 3384.079
a few steps towards the good direction

3381.92 --> 3389.0
maybe that that is my

3384.079 --> 3389.0
four card the arwinian forecast

3393.599 --> 3400.52
yeah and problems with the republican

3396.4 --> 3400.52
party are also being addressed

3408.4 --> 3411.76
so it

3409.76 --> 3414.1600000000003
yeah that's the way it kind of gave me a

3411.76 --> 3416.559
good feeling even though it's like yeah

3414.16 --> 3418.48
it's not over yet and not i'm not

3416.559 --> 3419.6800000000003
talking about the dichotomy that's

3418.48 --> 3421.76
playing out

3419.68 --> 3424.24
that seems to be going towards it but it

3421.76 --> 3425.92
doesn't mean it's over yet

3424.24 --> 3428.0
because what is going to happen after

3425.92 --> 3431.7200000000003

3428.0 --> 3431.72
