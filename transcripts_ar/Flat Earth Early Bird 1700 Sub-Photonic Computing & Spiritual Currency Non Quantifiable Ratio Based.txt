[Music]

61.94 --> 69.6
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

65.519 --> 71.159
bird Number 1700 I'm your host Arwin and

69.6 --> 73.25999999999999
before we start the show please don't

71.159 --> 75.92
forget to share it on any platform

73.26 --> 78.18
medium fit and if you haven't already

75.92 --> 80.52
subscribe to my channel hit the Bell

78.18 --> 83.22000000000001
notification so you know when I'm going

80.52 --> 86.52
live which is normally 1pm Amsterdam

83.22 --> 88.979
time and weekdays and 2 p.m Amsterdam

86.52 --> 91.19999999999999
time in a weekend and please also do

88.979 --> 93.479
support me through the PayPal and the

91.2 --> 95.82000000000001
patreon that would much appreciate it

93.479 --> 98.52
and and really you still use the sport

95.82 --> 101.69999999999999
even though I'm all right right now

98.52 --> 104.64
not starving but

101.7 --> 106.68
yeah everything is still expensive

104.64 --> 109.2
right anyway

106.68 --> 110.7
s

109.2 --> 113.299
yeah

110.7 --> 113.299
that

114.18 --> 119.64
it's very cloudy

117.299 --> 122.72000000000001
and very moist

119.64 --> 122.72
not so hot

126.119 --> 129.72
although yeah I'm like whoa it's a

128.16 --> 133.07999999999998
little bit cold I'm not gonna wear like

129.72 --> 136.8
long pants long sleeve pants with the

133.08 --> 139.62
sweater because it just gets so sticky

136.8 --> 141.92000000000002
so this is kind of like a cloudy sticky

139.62 --> 141.92000000000002
day

144.319 --> 147.379
all right

147.739 --> 155.28
so it is Friday the 25th of August 2023

159.36 --> 164.519
temperature 23 degrees 80 humidity yeah

163.319 --> 167.29999999999998
it makes sense

164.519 --> 167.3
low wind

168.8 --> 173.34
the prediction says it's going to be

171.12 --> 176.459
like thunder

173.34 --> 178.26
storming this weekend

176.459 --> 181.2
we'll see

178.26 --> 185.34
I wouldn't mind

181.2 --> 188.89999999999998
anyway hello speed ER first in chat

185.34 --> 188.9
house with see you

199.68 --> 205.019
yeah welcome to the 1700th episode

203.099 --> 206.34
that actually had a title before I

205.019 --> 208.11
started the show

206.34 --> 210.72
how about that

208.11 --> 213.20000000000002
[Music]

210.72 --> 213.2
uh

216.08 --> 221.70000000000002
so yeah I'm fully stocked up

219.54 --> 223.67999999999998
who's the energy drink probably gonna

221.7 --> 226.11999999999998
need that

223.68 --> 228.68
last of the rookola

226.12 --> 231.659
[Music]

228.68 --> 233.28
Illuminati Castle but look forward to

231.659 --> 238.28
that one

233.28 --> 238.28
I did not eat a lot yesterday so

238.379 --> 243.239
I did eat a pizza and I've already that

241.08 --> 245.28
was weird like I haven't eaten a pizza

243.239 --> 249.739
like in

245.28 --> 249.739
at least a month probably more

250.2 --> 255.659
and

252.84 --> 257.519
and yeah that wasn't too great I mean it

255.659 --> 260.94
tasted all nice and all that it's just

257.519 --> 263.58
the way it sat in me it it kind of

260.94 --> 266.3
bogged me down I just noticed

263.58 --> 266.3
so I'm gonna

266.699 --> 270.66
try to stick to the food model that I

269.04 --> 271.8
have been sticking to in the last month

270.66 --> 275.46000000000004
because

271.8 --> 279.06
not eating pizzas anymore it

275.46 --> 282.12
I even had trouble even finishing it

279.06 --> 284.639
but then I basically like oh first AF in

282.12 --> 287.24
the afternoon second half lit much later

284.639 --> 287.24
in the evening

287.699 --> 292.68
and that besides the Illuminati Hassan

290.759 --> 295.259
that was pretty much everything I ate

292.68 --> 298.759
that day yesterday

295.259 --> 298.759
and it was good enough

299.96 --> 303.68
but uh yeah

306.12 --> 315.199
I need to eat something else eventually

310.08 --> 315.19899999999996
right you know hello Richard G it's you

318.36 --> 320.78000000000003
oh

328.979 --> 331.94
how are you guys doing

332.52 --> 341.29999999999995
is listening to own Benjamin

336.18 --> 341.3
from yesterday he's like on about this

342.9 --> 348.9
orange man set yeah orange man sad this

346.979 --> 352.25899999999996
guy that's like a sort of a country

348.9 --> 355.08
music guy that's being super propped up

352.259 --> 358.039
out of nowhere and his song like his

355.08 --> 358.039
text really sucks

358.74 --> 364.02
but also yeah Flat Earth stuff in

361.5 --> 366.539
between Owen's been talking plenty about

364.02 --> 369.25899999999996
that and it does really seem like he is

366.539 --> 369.259
paying attention

372.36 --> 377.039
and like

374.12 --> 378.96
recently he rolled into like talking

377.039 --> 381.0
about the sun and the distance to the

378.96 --> 383.23999999999995
Sun a kind of whole item about it

381.0 --> 383.24
yesterday

384.8 --> 390.06
including recognizing like yeah maybe it

387.78 --> 391.919
doesn't have a distance

390.06 --> 394.68
so I think that's the first time I saw

391.919 --> 400.139
him say that

394.68 --> 403.68
so it took him long enough but yeah hey

400.139 --> 406.08
I call it a non-local hologram

403.68 --> 408.38
because I don't think there is an actual

406.08 --> 408.38
distance

408.419 --> 415.58
it's just an apparent distance and

411.24 --> 415.58
the only real thing we got is an angle

421.02 --> 426.56
right anyway hello moon buggy good to

424.259 --> 426.56
see you

427.44 --> 431.21999999999997
so I thought for the 1700th episode I'd

430.139 --> 433.74
uh

431.22 --> 437.16
fish back into the past

433.74 --> 439.16
to some of these Sci-Fi technologies

437.16 --> 441.84000000000003
that I basically

439.16 --> 444.90000000000003
thought up

441.84 --> 448.56
like in response to

444.9 --> 450.08
uh yeah my my investigation about the

448.56 --> 451.919
nature of light

450.08 --> 453.96
mainly

451.919 --> 458.9
like

453.96 --> 458.9
is a photon really the smallest amount

459.12 --> 468.479
or is that minimum amount directly

464.699 --> 470.28000000000003
intricately tied in with the material

468.479 --> 472.8
like

470.28 --> 476.0
the material can't be any smaller than

472.8 --> 479.639
those atoms so when it's going to

476.0 --> 483.18
respond to energy to cause that

479.639 --> 488.22
transition effect photoelectric effect

483.18 --> 490.62
well any light that's gonna arrive there

488.22 --> 492.84000000000003
is like it's not going to be sufficient

490.62 --> 496.68
until it builds up that critical mass

492.84 --> 497.69899999999996
that directly resonates with the atomic

496.68 --> 498.96
size

497.699 --> 501.90000000000003
right

498.96 --> 506.23999999999995
so thereby the conclusion would be for

501.9 --> 506.23999999999995
me is that photon is not a minimum unit

506.46 --> 510.06
right but

508.8 --> 512.0600000000001
in order

510.06 --> 512.06
for

512.339 --> 517.5600000000001
in order to register

514.86 --> 521.159
the the smallest amount of light the

517.56 --> 524.5799999999999
photoelectric effect is used

521.159 --> 527.04
because theoretically it can be smaller

524.58 --> 529.32
and well

527.04 --> 531.7199999999999
I've devised tests to actually prove

529.32 --> 533.5400000000001
that it could be smaller and like still

531.72 --> 536.0400000000001
existent

533.54 --> 539.88
I haven't actually performed the test

536.04 --> 542.42
yes because I don't have to argon pump

539.88 --> 542.42
lasers

543.66 --> 550.8
right but what if I was right what if

548.22 --> 552.9590000000001
light is smaller than a photon well

550.8 --> 556.38
if it is if we're dealing with an

552.959 --> 559.3389999999999
infinite smallness then

556.38 --> 559.3389999999999
that gives

559.38 --> 564.18
like an infinite fractal

562.44 --> 566.339
creativity

564.18 --> 569.8199999999999
like it gives you room to build

566.339 --> 572.82
potentially infinite complexity within a

569.82 --> 574.74
very finite amount of space even that's

572.82 --> 576.2
if that's not already happening like

574.74 --> 580.74
with

576.2 --> 584.0
with modern computers with the chips

580.74 --> 586.5
except that's electric based

584.0 --> 589.44
right but

586.5 --> 592.2
if you'd have sub photonic Computing

589.44 --> 595.1400000000001
like a computer that isn't like electric

592.2 --> 598.08
based but actually like based right

595.14 --> 601.74
we're already using light

598.08 --> 604.9200000000001
for data communication right

601.74 --> 608.7
fiber optics is is light based

604.92 --> 611.2199999999999
so what if you'd make like a chip that

608.7 --> 613.44
is light based so there is because

611.22 --> 614.58
there's this funny Advantage you see

613.44 --> 616.5
about light

614.58 --> 620.4590000000001
and that is that

616.5 --> 624.24
it doesn't build up as much much heat

620.459 --> 626.6999999999999
because you can very easily like

624.24 --> 627.899
use certain types of light that simply

626.7 --> 630.1800000000001
don't

627.899 --> 632.519
generate types of light that don't

630.18 --> 635.8199999999999
really give off heat

632.519 --> 637.86
but they are like instantaneous

635.82 --> 639.899
so what if you could use that to

637.86 --> 642.6
actually build microchips that are

639.899 --> 647.48
purely light based

642.6 --> 647.48
and could be so micronically small

647.88 --> 652.32
that I don't know

649.86 --> 655.5
I'm not an engineer I don't exactly know

652.32 --> 657.899
like how that chip would work

655.5 --> 660.959
I'm just kind of reimagining the

657.899 --> 665.519
framework being Electrics

660.959 --> 669.4799999999999
switch to light and thereby eliminating

665.519 --> 672.48
a lot of like uh energy loss issues

669.48 --> 675.0
right they're computers like ooh they

672.48 --> 677.16
heat up yeah it's because all that

675.0 --> 679.32
electricity is all being active in there

677.16 --> 681.42
it's heating it up

679.32 --> 684.899
well what if you had

681.42 --> 686.76
a light based chip I don't know how that

684.899 --> 689.76
could work by the way how you could

686.76 --> 691.98
actually have Micro

689.76 --> 695.04
light generators

691.98 --> 698.16
that's a big challenge

695.04 --> 700.62
if it's even like logical to pursue

698.16 --> 702.18
because I mean of course first it would

700.62 --> 705.42
have to be established that light is

702.18 --> 708.7199999999999
indeed smaller than a photon

705.42 --> 711.4799999999999
right and then you could proceed

708.72 --> 714.0
to attempt to build something like that

711.48 --> 716.22
with it and I thought well yeah that's

714.0 --> 719.1
very interesting and

716.22 --> 721.88
a potential technological advantage that

719.1 --> 721.88
could come out of

724.8 --> 729.3
yeah I'd say scientific discovery in

727.5 --> 733.22
this case although it's more like a what

729.3 --> 733.2199999999999
is question out of this

733.44 --> 738.0600000000001
test

735.6 --> 741.14
right so I thought it's worth mentioning

738.06 --> 741.14
again on this episode

742.26 --> 748.5
it's critical mass equal to one Photon

745.2 --> 751.8000000000001
well the idea would be with the figuring

748.5 --> 753.72
out how small a photon really is the

751.8 --> 756.899
critical mass that I mentioned is

753.72 --> 759.9590000000001
dependent it's the critical mass

756.899 --> 762.24
for the particular atom

759.959 --> 765.8599999999999
with which the

762.24 --> 765.86
photon is interacting

771.44 --> 777.6600000000001
what I how would your double laser test

774.959 --> 779.8199999999999
work well the idea was you take two pump

777.66 --> 781.92
argon lasers

779.82 --> 784.5
or I can pump out whatever you call that

781.92 --> 785.8199999999999
it's the device that's able to actually

784.5 --> 788.76
like

785.82 --> 792.0600000000001
have controlled burst of alleged one

788.76 --> 794.66
Photon and potentially modify it

792.06 --> 794.66
whatever

795.24 --> 803.639
enable the Argon pump laser to exert

800.0 --> 806.519
photonic energy for less than one Photon

803.639 --> 810.6800000000001
I'm sure it should be possible slider

806.519 --> 810.68
wise like I mean you're

811.2 --> 815.519
and then logically like yeah why would

813.6 --> 818.16
you do that is not producing a file yeah

815.519 --> 823.68
yeah just oh bear with me and then make

818.16 --> 826.019
it produce let's say 60 to 75 of a

823.68 --> 828.18
photon so that when you fire it on a

826.019 --> 830.1
photoelectric plate it's not gonna

828.18 --> 831.8389999999999
register like it doesn't matter how many

830.1 --> 833.82
times you do that

831.839 --> 837.9590000000001
it's not going to register

833.82 --> 839.639
then you take two of those lasers

837.959 --> 842.9399999999999
is that damn it

839.639 --> 847.0790000000001
60 to 75 percent

842.94 --> 849.839
and then aim them at exactly the right

847.079 --> 852.3599999999999
spot and this is gonna be like super

849.839 --> 855.48
super exact

852.36 --> 859.44
I mean unbelievably exact

855.48 --> 860.82
has to be like the micrometer exact if

859.44 --> 863.4590000000001
possible

860.82 --> 864.9590000000001
so you aim to pump argon lasers at the

863.459 --> 867.899
same spot

864.959 --> 870.06
generate less than a photon worth of

867.899 --> 873.24
photonic energy

870.06 --> 876.66
light energy and aimed at the exact same

873.24 --> 878.94
spot now if the photon is indeed a

876.66 --> 882.0
minimum unit

878.94 --> 885.36
that literally doesn't exist

882.0 --> 888.0
Beyond those minimum limitations then

885.36 --> 892.139
nothing should happen there should be no

888.0 --> 894.6
registry when two photonic

892.139 --> 896.88
uh yeah went to Urban Farm places fire

894.6 --> 898.44
less than a photon worth of energy at

896.88 --> 901.92
exactly the same spot

898.44 --> 903.5400000000001
but if my idea my model for light was

901.92 --> 905.3389999999999
correct

903.54 --> 908.3389999999999
then

905.339 --> 910.6800000000001
a photon should register even though

908.339 --> 914.7790000000001
when fired separately a photon wouldn't

910.68 --> 917.9399999999999
register but combined if they register

914.779 --> 919.68
then my assessment about light is

917.94 --> 922.32
correct and it is

919.68 --> 924.8389999999999
infinitely divisible

922.32 --> 928.019
there is no minimum size

924.839 --> 932.1600000000001
there is no minimum quanta the quanta

928.019 --> 935.16
was simply limited to the material

932.16 --> 935.16
interaction

935.279 --> 940.68
because the material would not there

937.98 --> 943.74
would be no smaller material that would

940.68 --> 947.54
require a less photonic energy to have

943.74 --> 947.54
the reaction like that's not available

948.12 --> 953.88
right so that's where the that's what my

951.18 --> 957.8599999999999
test was involved

953.88 --> 957.86
hope that's understood now

963.839 --> 967.32
take

964.8 --> 969.4799999999999
criticism from a [ __ ] Sean Hawkins

967.32 --> 971.72
[ __ ] about this [ __ ] you've never done

969.48 --> 971.72
anything

971.88 --> 977.0
so don't you project your

974.76 --> 977.0
foreign

978.0 --> 981.6
your lack of having done anything unto

980.519 --> 984.079
me thanks

981.6 --> 984.0790000000001
John

986.22 --> 991.9200000000001
how do partial photons combine to create

988.74 --> 994.44
a new Photon well it's simple if they

991.92 --> 997.3199999999999
are aim that let's just say the exact

994.44 --> 1000.22
same atom photoelectric

997.32 --> 1000.22
material

1000.56 --> 1008.1389999999999
then the photonic energy is basically

1003.74 --> 1008.139
absorbed by the atom

1008.32 --> 1013.9590000000001
simultaneously so both photonic energies

1011.959 --> 1017.4399999999999
are

1013.959 --> 1020.5999999999999
infusing the same atom and thereby

1017.44 --> 1023.899
creating more than a photon worth of

1020.6 --> 1026.3600000000001
energy being absorbed causing the X

1023.899 --> 1029.26
causing the triggering causing the

1026.36 --> 1029.26
photoelectric effect

1029.36 --> 1032.1399999999999
that's how

1045.74 --> 1047.98
foreign

1048.079 --> 1052.76
yeah I know I I belong at a university

1051.5 --> 1054.919
but

1052.76 --> 1056.72
it's not happening I mean if they'd

1054.919 --> 1059.9
invite me if somebody's actually like

1056.72 --> 1063.58
hey that's actually a really brilliant

1059.9 --> 1063.5800000000002
investigative idea Arwen

1065.179 --> 1069.679
probably you weren't a flat Earth or we

1067.34 --> 1072.02
wouldn't have so much hassle

1069.679 --> 1075.7
getting you in or something involved

1072.02 --> 1075.7
like oh yeah sure

1078.799 --> 1083.72
just let it or well I don't have to say

1081.38 --> 1086.1200000000001
let it be on record it is on record that

1083.72 --> 1088.28
I definitely figured this out I

1086.12 --> 1091.1599999999999
presented it all on my shows in the last

1088.28 --> 1093.08
seven years six years I don't know when

1091.16 --> 1095.5
I started to talk about this subject

1093.08 --> 1098.539
specifically it might be like around

1095.5 --> 1101.059
three years ago I'm not sure

1098.539 --> 1104.9
it's not an subject that I addressed

1101.059 --> 1107.84
from the very start from the very get-go

1104.9 --> 1110.299
but uh yeah I definitely figured that

1107.84 --> 1113.799
out that was me so anybody else that

1110.299 --> 1117.3799999999999
might like oh wow I just figured out a

1113.799 --> 1120.2
reassessment of light look at this yeah

1117.38 --> 1122.6000000000001
guess what yeah they probably stole that

1120.2 --> 1124.82
from me unless they said like yeah I was

1122.6 --> 1126.799
inspired by somebody online here he is

1124.82 --> 1131.559
that's Arwin

1126.799 --> 1131.559
and then I'm very okay with that

1137.66 --> 1140.26
anyway

1143.6 --> 1149.4189999999999
you don't understand how to modify a

1146.419 --> 1152.7800000000002
pump laser to pump partial photon

1149.419 --> 1156.14
well it's just an energy activator I

1152.78 --> 1158.48
mean photons are not like balls

1156.14 --> 1160.6000000000001
that are being shot out of like a tennis

1158.48 --> 1164.72
ball shooting machine or something okay

1160.6 --> 1166.4599999999998
it's Just Energy buildup

1164.72 --> 1170.78
and that

1166.46 --> 1172.4
like unleashes the photon right that's

1170.78 --> 1175.039
what happens

1172.4 --> 1178.4
so the amount of energy you're gonna

1175.039 --> 1182.5
insert well is so controllable that an

1178.4 --> 1182.5
exact Photon worth of energy can be

1183.14 --> 1191.14
released

1184.7 --> 1193.46
so why not slightly less than right

1191.14 --> 1197.5590000000002
it's that's it shouldn't be that

1193.46 --> 1197.559
complicated to do that speed or

1199.6 --> 1205.6399999999999
two ideas yeah that's really cute Aries

1202.7 --> 1206.78
106 but let's time stamp that then

1205.64 --> 1208.88
yeah

1206.78 --> 1211.3999999999999
it's really cute that somebody else came

1208.88 --> 1214.46
up on the same idea while somebody is

1211.4 --> 1216.6200000000001
publicly for free

1214.46 --> 1220.3400000000001
spouting out their ideas on the internet

1216.62 --> 1223.4599999999998
getting very little attention

1220.34 --> 1225.1999999999998
yeah I came up with it first well then I

1223.46 --> 1227.1200000000001
came up with it first I don't give a

1225.2 --> 1229.76
[ __ ] if somebody else says they've never

1227.12 --> 1233.299
heard of me before

1229.76 --> 1236.12
I came up with it first

1233.299 --> 1238.6399999999999
it's literally my project part of my

1236.12 --> 1239.539
life's work discovering the nature of

1238.64 --> 1241.5200000000002
light

1239.539 --> 1243.5
yeah that I started like when I was

1241.52 --> 1246.94
seven

1243.5 --> 1246.94
this is mine

1264.4 --> 1271.48
and literature is literature there is

1268.28 --> 1271.48
106. I mean

1272.9 --> 1276.64
we're not talking literature

1277.4 --> 1280.72
talking physics

1284.539 --> 1290.24
I've applied for patents no how the [ __ ]

1287.78 --> 1292.46
do I I don't even know how to do that

1290.24 --> 1295.299
and I'd probably have to pay money for

1292.46 --> 1295.299
that that I can't

1310.039 --> 1316.179
Alfred what the [ __ ] Alfred I what the

1313.22 --> 1316.179
hell does that mean Oz

1322.039 --> 1327.74
yeah I know Aries 106. so hey

1325.34 --> 1329.84
anybody out there wants to help me out

1327.74 --> 1332.539
test this

1329.84 --> 1335.08
as two argon pump lasers available that

1332.539 --> 1335.08
would be great

1335.12 --> 1341.6589999999999
refracted curvature John actually almost

1338.659 --> 1345.14
helped me to prove this and then he kind

1341.659 --> 1347.659
of just backed out it was really [ __ ]

1345.14 --> 1350.0590000000002
disappointing

1347.659 --> 1354.2800000000002
because he does actually have access to

1350.059 --> 1354.28
an argon pump laser but only just one

1365.0 --> 1369.32
and it seems like he's just completely

1367.22 --> 1371.419
lost interest for some reason

1369.32 --> 1372.6789999999999
even though we talked about it for like

1371.419 --> 1375.88
a year

1372.679 --> 1375.88
behind the scenes

1376.58 --> 1381.02
and then friction and whatever and then

1379.52 --> 1382.8799999999999
he just like

1381.02 --> 1386.44
didn't seem to be interested anymore

1382.88 --> 1386.44
didn't talk to me about it

1395.72 --> 1399.159
but yeah what can you do

1399.82 --> 1403.0
all right

1418.7 --> 1425.679
split the boom beam and no

1422.419 --> 1425.679
no that wouldn't work

1435.26 --> 1440.179
that way we're talking about singular

1438.5 --> 1443.96
photon

1440.179 --> 1446.9
there's not gonna be splitting

1443.96 --> 1449.179
that's just not gonna work

1446.9 --> 1452.419
I mean it's already we're gonna try to

1449.179 --> 1453.8600000000001
exert one less than one photons worth of

1452.419 --> 1456.14
light so

1453.86 --> 1457.9399999999998
splitting yeah good [ __ ] luck with

1456.14 --> 1460.039
that

1457.94 --> 1463.039
if you can figure out how to do that

1460.039 --> 1465.46
you'd probably like win a Nobel Prize

1463.039 --> 1468.8799999999999
for just being able to do that

1465.46 --> 1468.88
so no

1469.16 --> 1472.269
[Music]

1472.9 --> 1475.9
thank you

1479.24 --> 1483.32
I mean if you figure out how to split

1481.76 --> 1486.799
his photon

1483.32 --> 1490.78
and then recombine it good bro go for it

1486.799 --> 1490.78
man that sounds really heavy

1491.539 --> 1496.82
why can't you split

1494.24 --> 1497.6
because how the [ __ ] are you gonna do

1496.82 --> 1499.76
that

1497.6 --> 1502.1589999999999
oh why can't you do it yeah because I

1499.76 --> 1505.4
don't know how if you figure out how

1502.159 --> 1507.679
then go ahead just do it I'm not talking

1505.4 --> 1510.74
about the billions and billions of

1507.679 --> 1513.94
possibilities if it were possible

1510.74 --> 1513.94
I'm not there

1516.02 --> 1520.94
right I'm not gonna treat this like it's

1518.179 --> 1522.26
like looping mechanics within the realm

1520.94 --> 1524.0
or something look at all these

1522.26 --> 1528.32
possibilities and that possibility yeah

1524.0 --> 1531.74
like uh no this is physics I'm not

1528.32 --> 1534.799
I'm not gonna take Liberties and steps

1531.74 --> 1537.32
ahead on what would be possible if yeah

1534.799 --> 1540.3799999999999
I thought that sub photonic Computing is

1537.32 --> 1542.6
already pretty pretty far ahead

1540.38 --> 1544.64
it's pretty wild

1542.6 --> 1548.059
I'm Gonna Leave it to that

1544.64 --> 1551.3600000000001
let's just see if there is any validity

1548.059 --> 1554.24
to the idea at all

1551.36 --> 1556.82
by the test and the test is relatively

1554.24 --> 1558.679
simple I don't have to split up a photon

1556.82 --> 1560.72
you just have to exert less than a

1558.679 --> 1562.5800000000002
photon worth of energy with a pump argon

1560.72 --> 1564.919
laser two of them

1562.58 --> 1567.32
that's it

1564.919 --> 1569.0590000000002
sounds reasonable

1567.32 --> 1570.08
[Music]

1569.059 --> 1572.299
okay

1570.08 --> 1574.9399999999998
saying oh let's just split a photon and

1572.299 --> 1577.34
recombine it is not reasonable

1574.94 --> 1579.98
you can't even physically describe how

1577.34 --> 1581.779
you would do that material wise like

1579.98 --> 1585.88
what are you gonna do to do that exactly

1581.779 --> 1585.88
yeah yeah that's the problem

1591.039 --> 1596.32
anyway the decent questions by the way

1593.72 --> 1596.32
speeder

1605.48 --> 1608.679
where the hell is everybody

1614.24 --> 1617.679
it's a half hour in

1618.08 --> 1621.52
where's my wrenches

1635.86 --> 1642.799
not splitting a [ __ ] no a photon is not

1639.08 --> 1647.6789999999999
a molecule speeder a photon

1642.799 --> 1647.679
is just a quanta of energy

1647.84 --> 1656.02
it's not a thing that is technically

1652.039 --> 1656.02
like an atom that you split

1658.94 --> 1665.919
Googling two Arkham lasers why the [ __ ]

1662.36 --> 1665.9189999999999
are you googling that Aries

1666.38 --> 1670.88
I don't think that's in a title anywhere

1668.659 --> 1674.1200000000001
that's you can't find that in text form

1670.88 --> 1678.2
I've only ever just spoken it on my

1674.12 --> 1680.6789999999999
shows you can't Google sound recordings

1678.2 --> 1680.679
laughs

1708.799 --> 1714.74
yeah and by the way the word sub

1711.559 --> 1717.6789999999999
photonic is not a word that's going to

1714.74 --> 1720.02
be used it's literally science fiction

1717.679 --> 1723.0800000000002
word

1720.02 --> 1725.84
right that's why I use that in the title

1723.08 --> 1729.26
sub photonic computing

1725.84 --> 1734.02
it's based on the assumption that

1729.26 --> 1734.02
there is smaller than photon

1739.34 --> 1745.1589999999999
but yeah you're not gonna find that word

1742.4 --> 1747.98
in a little physics experiment because

1745.159 --> 1749.6000000000001
in order to find that word in a literal

1747.98 --> 1751.659
physics experiment

1749.6 --> 1755.12
well it would be fact

1751.659 --> 1757.64
it's that simple otherwise you're not

1755.12 --> 1760.2399999999998
gonna find that

1757.64 --> 1760.24
foreign

1763.1 --> 1767.6
if you'd find an experiment that mean

1765.38 --> 1769.22
that I was correct and that my theory

1767.6 --> 1773.1789999999999
has been proven

1769.22 --> 1776.779
that that light is smaller than a photon

1773.179 --> 1778.7
and potentially infinitely small but I

1776.779 --> 1781.34
mean yeah you can do further testing you

1778.7 --> 1785.419
know because hey if you find that two

1781.34 --> 1786.98
argon pump lasers are able to create a

1785.419 --> 1788.96
photon together

1786.98 --> 1791.3600000000001
with less than a photon worth of energy

1788.96 --> 1794.48
well then you can scale up the

1791.36 --> 1797.6
experiment and see how far you can go

1794.48 --> 1799.64
like what about then this is insane like

1797.6 --> 1802.6399999999999
cost wise but

1799.64 --> 1804.14
a hundred argon pump lasers and they all

1802.64 --> 1806.0
shoot

1804.14 --> 1811.3990000000001
like

1806.0 --> 1815.24
what is it one and a quarter a hundredth

1811.399 --> 1815.2399999999998
so it's like 1.25

1816.1 --> 1823.1
of an atom worth of

1820.24 --> 1825.26
photonic energy and they all fired that

1823.1 --> 1828.1999999999998
little amount and then see if it still

1825.26 --> 1831.74
recombines into a photon right the C

1828.2 --> 1834.98
does it indeed scale down potentially

1831.74 --> 1838.039
infinitely how far does it scale down

1834.98 --> 1841.159
right it might not work after

1838.039 --> 1843.44
less than one tenth of a photonic worth

1841.159 --> 1846.0200000000002
of energy it won't

1843.44 --> 1848.299
work anymore it there might still be

1846.02 --> 1850.72
limitations so who knows you know that's

1848.299 --> 1850.72
the point

1851.899 --> 1857.7399999999998
could it be

1854.12 --> 1857.7399999999998
infinitely divisible

1857.96 --> 1862.64
I think it could be

1860.179 --> 1866.1200000000001
there is no Direct

1862.64 --> 1867.98
barrier staring at me at in the distance

1866.12 --> 1870.1999999999998
or in the depths that's like yeah it's

1867.98 --> 1872.1200000000001
definitely gonna halt after that I don't

1870.2 --> 1874.039
know it could literally be infinitely

1872.12 --> 1876.1399999999999
divisible

1874.039 --> 1878.419
it's just not really relevant anymore

1876.14 --> 1880.64
because yeah if it's infinitely small

1878.419 --> 1882.38
then its influence is going to be

1880.64 --> 1883.8200000000002
infinitely small

1882.38 --> 1885.64
you're not going to be able to actually

1883.82 --> 1887.32
perceive anything

1885.64 --> 1890.0590000000002
right

1887.32 --> 1893.0
with just that amount the only way to

1890.059 --> 1896.12
even perceive it is to become well one

1893.0 --> 1898.279
photonic Photon worth of energy so that

1896.12 --> 1899.7199999999998
a photoelectric effect can react and

1898.279 --> 1901.039
then you know ah there's definitely

1899.72 --> 1903.7
something there

1901.039 --> 1903.7
see

1907.279 --> 1913.539
but for light to be there even though

1910.58 --> 1913.539
not detectable

1914.6 --> 1918.1999999999998
yeah

1916.36 --> 1922.1
recombine it

1918.2 --> 1924.52
and see if it is still there

1922.1 --> 1924.52
right

1924.919 --> 1932.72
60 to 75 percent of one Photon worth of

1928.88 --> 1938.2
energy fire two times from two separate

1932.72 --> 1938.2
lasers onto one atom

1938.32 --> 1944.0
photoelectric effect

1940.82 --> 1950.1789999999999
to create that yeah

1944.0 --> 1950.179
anyway hey steamy traveler Terry 306 LSG

1952.1 --> 1955.899
C some wrenches in here

1963.279 --> 1967.279
right yeah yesterday's show uh there's

1965.84 --> 1969.86
some drilling by the way I don't know if

1967.279 --> 1973.039
you guys are hearing it hope not

1969.86 --> 1975.6789999999999
[Music]

1973.039 --> 1979.399
a little probably

1975.679 --> 1981.5590000000002
I can live with it anyway uh

1979.399 --> 1984.1999999999998
laughs

1981.559 --> 1987.3799999999999
yeah steamy traveler had a great video

1984.2 --> 1990.559
that he found yesterday he posted it in

1987.38 --> 1994.64
the comment section after my request

1990.559 --> 1997.6
of a slo-mo videoed lightning strike and

1994.64 --> 1997.6000000000001
it's so fascinating

1997.76 --> 2001.919
because I did it all by memory

2002.14 --> 2007.8990000000001
and to then just see it like that it's

2004.539 --> 2009.899
like oh a plasma reaction is crawling

2007.899 --> 2013.6589999999999
and it's like

2009.899 --> 2016.059
and then it touches It and Bang instant

2013.659 --> 2018.1000000000001
I mean that lightning is freaking ins

2016.059 --> 2020.1399999999999
there's no speed

2018.1 --> 2021.279
the speed from one side to the other

2020.14 --> 2023.94
it's

2021.279 --> 2023.94
bomb

2028.899 --> 2033.58
so yeah check out that little video

2031.72 --> 2036.3600000000001
that steamy traveler posted on

2033.58 --> 2036.36
yesterday's show

2037.779 --> 2041.799
maybe that can further

2040.059 --> 2043.4189999999999
the understanding of what I was talking

2041.799 --> 2045.34
about yesterday

2043.419 --> 2049.26
I think yesterday was actually probably

2045.34 --> 2049.2599999999998
one of my most interesting shows

2049.54 --> 2052.02
ever

2054.04 --> 2057.58
Maybe

2055.48 --> 2059.619
definitely one of the more interesting

2057.58 --> 2062.5
ones

2059.619 --> 2064.4190000000003
because I'm just making Headway as to

2062.5 --> 2065.679
figure out the understanding of what's

2064.419 --> 2069.58
Happening

2065.679 --> 2071.32
with light why this apparent type of

2069.58 --> 2073.5989999999997
speed why do you see that when you're

2071.32 --> 2077.679
looking from the side right

2073.599 --> 2080.98
while arguably the photon has already

2077.679 --> 2082.679
arrived and that's so fascinating that's

2080.98 --> 2085.359
like everybody's like

2082.679 --> 2088.54
that's how can it be arriving and then

2085.359 --> 2090.7
seeing it can pass like

2088.54 --> 2092.74
like yeah because that's not actually

2090.7 --> 2096.1589999999997
the light you're seeing

2092.74 --> 2097.54
it's the response from the material to

2096.159 --> 2100.06
the light

2097.54 --> 2101.94
's already there it's already on the

2100.06 --> 2105.099
other side it's instant

2101.94 --> 2107.7000000000003
but the material is responding

2105.099 --> 2107.7000000000003
slowly

2108.4 --> 2112.859
it requires some time to get excited

2115.46 --> 2118.829
[Music]

2119.22 --> 2124.74
spontaneous parametric down conversion

2122.079 --> 2124.7400000000002
what the [ __ ]

2124.839 --> 2130.0
uh can you tell me what that's about

2127.0 --> 2130.0
aries106

2130.119 --> 2134.339
that's a lot of shows yeah it is isn't

2132.28 --> 2134.3390000000004
it

2135.099 --> 2140.76
and I can't believe how

2137.68 --> 2140.7599999999998
how well it's going

2140.92 --> 2146.56
like these last this last month I've

2143.68 --> 2148.48
been doing like way better than any

2146.56 --> 2151.0789999999997
other period during the Flat Earth early

2148.48 --> 2151.079
bird show

2152.339 --> 2157.44
splinting photons what the hell Aries

2164.079 --> 2167.88
um I whatever

2169.38 --> 2174.46
there might look there's some

2171.7 --> 2176.9199999999996
theoretical stuff with that and

2174.46 --> 2179.7400000000002
like it's just like the more complex

2176.92 --> 2181.06
quantum mechanics related stuff like

2179.74 --> 2182.04
supposed

2181.06 --> 2185.74
to

2182.04 --> 2188.5
delay whatever it's like dude

2185.74 --> 2191.5
it's I don't get that yeah let's just

2188.5 --> 2194.68
I'll be honest I don't really get that

2191.5 --> 2197.22
as in like I can't get a grip on like

2194.68 --> 2201.16
what the [ __ ] they're even talking about

2197.22 --> 2203.3799999999997
so I'm not going with that I'm going

2201.16 --> 2206.14
with my own view here and my own

2203.38 --> 2209.619
investigation and I think that

2206.14 --> 2211.54
the suggested setup is viable I'm not

2209.619 --> 2214.079
really concerned with trying to split

2211.54 --> 2214.079
photons

2215.32 --> 2219.94
like I'm not gonna like cheat and say oh

2218.14 --> 2223.42
well let's start out with a photon that

2219.94 --> 2225.46
is registerable and then split it up or

2223.42 --> 2227.8
whatever oh it's not register anymore oh

2225.46 --> 2230.32
we recombine oh it's registered it's

2227.8 --> 2234.3390000000004
like that's cute

2230.32 --> 2235.98
but I want it to be like something that

2234.339 --> 2240.339
was originally

2235.98 --> 2242.98
not complete a photon

2240.339 --> 2245.38
so that it is a the point is to prove

2242.98 --> 2248.44
that it is a thing even when it isn't

2245.38 --> 2251.04
complete yeah that's the point of the

2248.44 --> 2251.04
the test

2251.92 --> 2257.02
so if it starts out in a photo and then

2254.38 --> 2259.2400000000002
oh then you use technology to do

2257.02 --> 2260.98
something with it and then assume it is

2259.24 --> 2264.3999999999996
in the photo that yeah that's all like

2260.98 --> 2268.3
ah whole literal Hall of Mirrors okay

2264.4 --> 2271.42
literally it's not even a joke I mean

2268.3 --> 2273.28
let's not do that and just say let's

2271.42 --> 2277.079
generate less than a photon worth of

2273.28 --> 2277.079
energy let's just go with that

2277.3 --> 2284.7400000000002
and then we can do Hall of mirror tests

2280.18 --> 2287.64
all after that if there's any kind of

2284.74 --> 2287.64
well if there's anything

2288.04 --> 2292.72
it doesn't I mean it sounds interesting

2290.14 --> 2299.2799999999997
but it's not the number one priority

2292.72 --> 2299.2799999999997
it's not how I prove my my model

2304.68 --> 2311.7599999999998
how do I get recognized a lot when I'm

2307.3 --> 2311.76
not in public through the internet

2312.0 --> 2318.64
I don't know because people take notice

2315.16 --> 2320.74
because people are curious and they want

2318.64 --> 2323.94
to find good sources of people with

2320.74 --> 2323.9399999999996
really high level ideas

2324.3 --> 2330.04
that just keep spouting them out

2327.46 --> 2333.04
barely taking credit for it

2330.04 --> 2335.2599999999998
or when they do it's not really like not

2333.04 --> 2339.04
actually a big price to pay they don't

2335.26 --> 2341.1400000000003
make your life a living hell

2339.04 --> 2343.599
for their credit

2341.14 --> 2345.2799999999997
or there isn't a big pay wall for like

2343.599 --> 2348.2200000000003
you have to pay at least two hundred

2345.28 --> 2351.46
dollars to listen in on this information

2348.22 --> 2354.18
yeah no that's not there

2351.46 --> 2354.18
so

2354.339 --> 2361.18
people that really want to figure out

2356.859 --> 2364.119
who who has good ideas they will find me

2361.18 --> 2367.06
they will not be able to lift me out of

2364.119 --> 2369.76
anonymity and why would they they got a

2367.06 --> 2372.24
perfect source that almost nobody seems

2369.76 --> 2372.2400000000002
to know about

2375.7 --> 2382.14
like why ruin it by making Arwen super

2379.119 --> 2385.48
popular all of a sudden I mean

2382.14 --> 2387.52
most people that are really super good

2385.48 --> 2391.119
at what they do and then they become

2387.52 --> 2394.599
famous guess what happens oh oh you

2391.119 --> 2397.2400000000002
didn't know yeah they start to suck yeah

2394.599 --> 2401.38
sounds familiar sounds familiar yeah

2397.24 --> 2405.5789999999997
that's literally the story of a lifetime

2401.38 --> 2408.1800000000003
for like at least half the people

2405.579 --> 2410.26
that get involved in media isn't it

2408.18 --> 2412.96
isn't it

2410.26 --> 2417.6600000000003
how many people do you know that were

2412.96 --> 2420.64
just fantastic are as sharp as a knife

2417.66 --> 2423.2799999999997
gleeful positive

2420.64 --> 2426.5789999999997
creative and then they got famous they

2423.28 --> 2428.5
got a big paycheck and then they suck

2426.579 --> 2429.7000000000003
sounds familiar

2428.5 --> 2432.52
yeah

2429.7 --> 2433.72
well guess what people that are really

2432.52 --> 2436.18
smart

2433.72 --> 2438.8199999999997
know that

2436.18 --> 2442.66
yeah

2438.82 --> 2446.26
and even Grapplers know that yeah

2442.66 --> 2448.24
they pile on lots of money

2446.26 --> 2449.92
with people that are seem to be

2448.24 --> 2451.7799999999997
Fantastical and Brilliant and

2449.92 --> 2454.0
self-sufficient

2451.78 --> 2456.1800000000003
to break them

2454.0 --> 2456.18
foreign

2462.099 --> 2467.7400000000002
it's that simple

2464.68 --> 2471.0989999999997
and it worked so many people why they

2467.74 --> 2474.3999999999996
think oh oh I scored big I got the big

2471.099 --> 2476.7400000000002
check that means I have achieved the

2474.4 --> 2478.7200000000003
ultimate success yeah yeah

2476.74 --> 2480.2799999999997
well say goodbye to everything that was

2478.72 --> 2482.2
actually valuable about you because

2480.28 --> 2486.0
that's gonna go now

2482.2 --> 2486.0
bye say goodbye

2489.64 --> 2494.68
yeah

2491.44 --> 2496.42
cause why why would that be why do

2494.68 --> 2498.52
people just try to no they don't want to

2496.42 --> 2502.359
throw their creativity away they don't

2498.52 --> 2503.56
want to throw that it's just that it was

2502.359 --> 2508.0
there

2503.56 --> 2509.74
for a reason because if you're tight if

2508.0 --> 2513.22
you feel like

2509.74 --> 2514.4799999999996
I'm not full if you have to struggle for

2513.22 --> 2518.3199999999997
it

2514.48 --> 2520.96
that purifies it if suddenly uh no more

2518.32 --> 2523.0
struggle you won you won the jackpot you

2520.96 --> 2524.859
got a big score oh you got all this

2523.0 --> 2526.599
money now everything comes easy all of a

2524.859 --> 2528.52
sudden oh you're all popular all these

2526.599 --> 2530.56
people want your attention they're gonna

2528.52 --> 2532.72
distract you we're gonna try to throw

2530.56 --> 2534.46
their ideas into you try to program you

2532.72 --> 2537.0989999999997
yeah yeah all of a suddenly everything

2534.46 --> 2540.94
is completely different now

2537.099 --> 2542.8590000000004
and you don't have that calm

2540.94 --> 2545.44
etern internal Flame

2542.859 --> 2547.24
because you were tight

2545.44 --> 2552.04
you don't have that it doesn't work

2547.24 --> 2555.5789999999997
you're not free from the Beast anymore

2552.04 --> 2557.44
you've got the money now the money is

2555.579 --> 2559.7200000000003
the Beast

2557.44 --> 2562.7200000000003
if you take from the Beast you become

2559.72 --> 2564.8199999999997
the Beast it's just money itself it's

2562.72 --> 2567.9399999999996
not even about who you're getting it

2564.82 --> 2572.02
from it's just that it is [ __ ] money

2567.94 --> 2574.66
yeah it is the Beast

2572.02 --> 2576.64
and the more you got of it the more you

2574.66 --> 2579.0989999999997
become the Beast and there's nothing

2576.64 --> 2582.64
anybody in the [ __ ] world can ever do

2579.099 --> 2585.6400000000003
about it that's just how it works

2582.64 --> 2585.64
right

2586.9 --> 2590.6800000000003
you get the money you lose everything

2589.119 --> 2593.319
that's valuable

2590.68 --> 2595.54
that's how it works and I know that and

2593.319 --> 2599.099
that's why I effectively did it

2595.54 --> 2599.099
a vow of poverty

2602.2 --> 2608.6189999999997
because I knew if I am going to use my

2605.619 --> 2610.6600000000003
brains that actually actually Master

2608.619 --> 2612.52
this world you know what's gonna happen

2610.66 --> 2616.0
to good old Arwin

2612.52 --> 2619.72
I'll literally be a [ __ ] hand rubbing

2616.0 --> 2623.92
Grappler looking like this behind my

2619.72 --> 2626.9199999999996
screen as I plot to deprive everybody of

2623.92 --> 2630.7000000000003
their wealth so that I can get it yeah

2626.92 --> 2633.2200000000003
that's what that will would happen

2630.7 --> 2636.5789999999997
that's what would have happened I've

2633.22 --> 2637.4199999999996
seen it happen to me before when I was

2636.579 --> 2639.819
young

2637.42 --> 2643.2400000000002
I turn into a [ __ ] Grappler I don't

2639.819 --> 2646.48
want to do that I don't want to be that

2643.24 --> 2650.5
I want the Brilliance I want the freedom

2646.48 --> 2652.66
of mind that's my value

2650.5 --> 2655.72
and I give up all the money in the world

2652.66 --> 2658.72
to have just that just that even if I'm

2655.72 --> 2661.5989999999997
starving even if I'm desperate I'll have

2658.72 --> 2662.74
that and nobody's gonna take that away

2661.599 --> 2665.98
from me

2662.74 --> 2669.359
you can't steal my wealth

2665.98 --> 2669.359
you can't steal it

2669.819 --> 2676.92
no manner of peer pressure trolls

2673.72 --> 2676.9199999999996
it doesn't matter

2680.5 --> 2685.98
what about middle class instead of Rich

2682.66 --> 2685.98
that would be cool

2687.04 --> 2691.839
I mean I didn't say you're automatically

2690.099 --> 2696.839
freaking evil

2691.839 --> 2696.839
if you're if you have any kind of income

2696.94 --> 2701.319
right because

2698.98 --> 2703.359
you're middle class and you're like

2701.319 --> 2706.0
being busy you got the good morale and

2703.359 --> 2709.119
you are doing it you're maintaining care

2706.0 --> 2711.579
for your workers and all that and you

2709.119 --> 2713.44
like take it serious yeah that's good

2711.579 --> 2716.079
you're still

2713.44 --> 2718.9
struggling you're still

2716.079 --> 2721.98
battling you're gonna yeah you're still

2718.9 --> 2721.98
that's that's good

2722.5 --> 2725.74
right

2723.52 --> 2728.2
just because you have some money it

2725.74 --> 2731.02
doesn't make you bad it's just that for

2728.2 --> 2732.339
me it was like if I surrender to like

2731.02 --> 2736.119
this

2732.339 --> 2738.94
money frenzy I'll turn into a Grappler

2736.119 --> 2740.859
I'll become really fanatically greedy

2738.94 --> 2742.3
all of a sudden I have said that's

2740.859 --> 2745.48
happened

2742.3 --> 2747.579
I become so greedy it's like the winning

2745.48 --> 2750.04
game for money and then when I get into

2747.579 --> 2751.599
that I literally stop caring about

2750.04 --> 2753.4
anybody

2751.599 --> 2755.44
it's like no it doesn't matter anymore

2753.4 --> 2758.7400000000002
that it's like

2755.44 --> 2762.66
I I win it's like I literally turn into

2758.74 --> 2762.66
a [ __ ] Grappler I don't want that

2763.24 --> 2766.319
I don't want it

2776.28 --> 2782.2200000000003
hbd what is that

2779.74 --> 2782.22
anyway

2785.44 --> 2788.44
phenomenamer

2791.26 --> 2794.579
that's that's funny

2798.94 --> 2803.64
but so you would be a phenomena

2809.68 --> 2812.22
laughs

2814.66 --> 2821.2799999999997
all right like a psychotomer

2817.48 --> 2821.28
I'm a bit of a psychonymer

2822.819 --> 2828.64
oh did I get so much money in the past

2825.819 --> 2831.96
my mother died

2828.64 --> 2831.96
and she had a life insurance

2841.18 --> 2847.7799999999997
right but I I never really got to it

2845.5 --> 2849.94
I've had many points especially in my

2847.78 --> 2851.2000000000003
teens where I was seduced all over the

2849.94 --> 2852.94
place

2851.2 --> 2855.2799999999997
it's like oh you want to get big money

2852.94 --> 2857.8
this is what we do and it's just like

2855.28 --> 2860.3190000000004
that's so [ __ ] up

2857.8 --> 2862.48
it's all just you want money you have to

2860.319 --> 2864.72
do really [ __ ] up stuff

2862.48 --> 2867.04
you have to effectively

2864.72 --> 2869.859
manipulate people

2867.04 --> 2872.44
[ __ ] themselves over so that you get the

2869.859 --> 2875.02
money and they'll be fooled and they

2872.44 --> 2877.96
want and they want they will be two

2875.02 --> 2881.099
proud to even admit they were full so

2877.96 --> 2881.099
you just get clean away

2881.26 --> 2887.079
you'll feel more paranoid for having

2884.26 --> 2889.3
gotten away with evil

2887.079 --> 2892.54
yeah

2889.3 --> 2894.6400000000003
that's what what Grappler suffer from is

2892.54 --> 2897.22
that paranoia from having gotten away

2894.64 --> 2900.1189999999997
with all that evil it's like they're too

2897.22 --> 2903.7599999999998
good and it's worrisome it scares them

2900.119 --> 2905.02
because God sees and they know

2903.76 --> 2907.0600000000004
like

2905.02 --> 2910.02
doesn't matter that they don't believe

2907.06 --> 2910.02
in it they know

2910.54 --> 2913.8
and that's what haunts them

2914.98 --> 2918.599
and I saw that very early

2929.079 --> 2934.98
a weird symbology on a five dollar

2930.88 --> 2934.98
twenty dollar bill right slow mo

2940.54 --> 2943.7799999999997
right but

2941.8 --> 2945.52
another approach with the whole money

2943.78 --> 2948.0400000000004
and the corruption thing you could see

2945.52 --> 2950.74
is that

2948.04 --> 2953.98
the money is actually the fake currency

2950.74 --> 2955.18
the real currency is your spirit

2953.98 --> 2959.14
yeah

2955.18 --> 2962.2
and if you trade your spirit

2959.14 --> 2964.839
for the the squares the magic squares is

2962.2 --> 2966.7599999999998
oh we'll call it the physical money then

2964.839 --> 2969.2799999999997
you literally

2966.76 --> 2973.0600000000004
threw away the most valuable thing you

2969.28 --> 2976.0600000000004
had for the fake money

2973.06 --> 2979.0
right if you can't get the fake money

2976.06 --> 2981.46
and not throw away your spirit

2979.0 --> 2983.98
like get it naturally it's like a side

2981.46 --> 2986.2
effect then to your actual currency the

2983.98 --> 2988.42
spirit being strong well then it's like

2986.2 --> 2990.64
wow it's bonus right it's money bonus

2988.42 --> 2993.2200000000003
money is a bonus

2990.64 --> 2995.5
but if you literally have to what they

2993.22 --> 2997.8999999999996
say sell your soul which could be

2995.5 --> 2999.64
considered as like you're gonna have to

2997.9 --> 3001.619
do things that are against your nature

2999.64 --> 3003.2999999999997
and like stick to that

3001.619 --> 3005.46
well then you're breaking with your

3003.3 --> 3007.5
nature so you're breaking with your

3005.46 --> 3009.2400000000002
spirit your spirit will decrease you

3007.5 --> 3011.46
will become more miserable you're

3009.24 --> 3013.4399999999996
sticking to doing something that's bad

3011.46 --> 3016.319
and you can feel it

3013.44 --> 3018.359
well now you're gonna deplete what to

3016.319 --> 3020.339
get the fake money what are you gonna do

3018.359 --> 3023.22
with all that fake money when your

3020.339 --> 3025.14
spirit's gone and you literally don't

3023.22 --> 3027.4199999999996
even want to enjoy the money anymore

3025.14 --> 3029.339
yeah that's the problem with them they

3027.42 --> 3032.88
lose their Spirit they got all this

3029.339 --> 3034.619
money and all that's left for them is to

3032.88 --> 3036.7200000000003
just want more money

3034.619 --> 3039.6600000000003
because they don't they can't [ __ ]

3036.72 --> 3042.66
even enjoy it anymore

3039.66 --> 3042.66
ah

3043.079 --> 3050.3390000000004
how's those riches eh

3045.78 --> 3054.48
enjoying it no I know I know you're not

3050.339 --> 3057.66
the only way you can enjoy it is to act

3054.48 --> 3058.92
like you're enjoying it towards poor

3057.66 --> 3061.92
people

3058.92 --> 3064.92
the only joy you get out of it is to

3061.92 --> 3067.8
gloat with it because on your own

3064.92 --> 3071.2200000000003
you don't feel a thing with it it's not

3067.8 --> 3073.619
making you happy I know only the

3071.22 --> 3077.04
gloating towards those that have none

3073.619 --> 3081.6800000000003
makes you happy anymore doesn't it yeah

3077.04 --> 3081.68
I know it's very tragic

3092.22 --> 3095.22
uh-huh

3107.16 --> 3113.5789999999997
right but yeah

3110.579 --> 3116.099
so my life's priority is definitely the

3113.579 --> 3118.6800000000003
spirit currency and not the physical

3116.099 --> 3122.52
currency but unfortunately yeah you

3118.68 --> 3125.2999999999997
still need physical currency so

3122.52 --> 3128.22
I'm still going to be very thankful

3125.3 --> 3129.6600000000003
for any physical support I get like

3128.22 --> 3131.8799999999997
through the PayPal

3129.66 --> 3133.68
I still need it

3131.88 --> 3135.9
I mean

3133.68 --> 3138.5989999999997
for the record

3135.9 --> 3142.26
I don't like being poor like this

3138.599 --> 3144.42
I mean I'm not shaming myself anymore I

3142.26 --> 3148.26
used to do that it used to be family

3144.42 --> 3151.6800000000003
Staples like like

3148.26 --> 3154.26
only weak people live off welfare like

3151.68 --> 3156.4199999999996
you're automatically you suck if you do

3154.26 --> 3159.1800000000003
that and like

3156.42 --> 3161.94
yeah but that with that attitude I'm

3159.18 --> 3164.5789999999997
never gonna get out of it so I'm just my

3161.94 --> 3167.46
tactic is like yeah I know this is not

3164.579 --> 3170.119
the way to go technically

3167.46 --> 3170.119
but

3170.46 --> 3175.859
I think I can be more productive this

3173.339 --> 3178.68
way I can

3175.859 --> 3180.839
bypass on like the massive amounts of

3178.68 --> 3184.319
stress that would have to deal with just

3180.839 --> 3186.359
dealing with people at work and this

3184.319 --> 3190.619
always was the [ __ ] problem in the

3186.359 --> 3192.96
past every every [ __ ] [ __ ] time I

3190.619 --> 3194.28
try to get a [ __ ] job yeah no matter

3192.96 --> 3196.819
where

3194.28 --> 3199.7000000000003
no matter where like Administration

3196.819 --> 3202.5
metal work

3199.7 --> 3204.96
delivering packages anything

3202.5 --> 3207.44
it's always the [ __ ] people

3204.96 --> 3211.079
would always be some piece of [ __ ] there

3207.44 --> 3213.839
that just didn't like the look of me

3211.079 --> 3215.6600000000003
and it would never even talk to me and

3213.839 --> 3219.66
they'd just like

3215.66 --> 3221.8799999999997
ensured that everybody somehow ended up

3219.66 --> 3224.2799999999997
looking down on me

3221.88 --> 3227.099
and I had times where I was just there

3224.28 --> 3228.96
and I would get inspired by an idea like

3227.099 --> 3230.6400000000003
something or like I liked or something

3228.96 --> 3232.44
right like then something physics

3230.64 --> 3234.7799999999997
related I wouldn't like to talk about

3232.44 --> 3236.76
Flat Earth I never did that at work I

3234.78 --> 3238.5
wasn't consciously aware of it but even

3236.76 --> 3242.4
if I had known I wouldn't start talking

3238.5 --> 3244.98
about that on the job floor right

3242.4 --> 3246.54
but even if I just had regular smart

3244.98 --> 3248.94
ideas

3246.54 --> 3251.4
there would be people there that would

3248.94 --> 3253.98
get so [ __ ] jealous they would

3251.4 --> 3257.64
literally like make up [ __ ] about me

3253.98 --> 3260.099
talk to the boss and then get me fired

3257.64 --> 3262.2
like make up [ __ ]

3260.099 --> 3266.2200000000003
to get me fired because it pissed them

3262.2 --> 3272.22
off somewhere it's like do guys

3266.22 --> 3274.3799999999997
work for me is Hell unless I am in

3272.22 --> 3278.8799999999997
control

3274.38 --> 3282.42
because nobody can [ __ ] responsibly

3278.88 --> 3284.6400000000003
handle with me and deal with me without

3282.42 --> 3285.96
getting freaking nervous breakdowns and

3284.64 --> 3288.2999999999997
having to send me away because

3285.96 --> 3289.46
everybody's going insane because of my

3288.3 --> 3293.28
presence

3289.46 --> 3296.94
I'm so [ __ ] done with that

3293.28 --> 3298.6800000000003
I'm so done with it I can't do that

3296.94 --> 3302.94
anymore

3298.68 --> 3305.64
I've been humiliated like throughout my

3302.94 --> 3307.859
teens and in early 20s because of this

3305.64 --> 3309.359
[ __ ] and at some point you're just gonna

3307.859 --> 3315.119
say

3309.359 --> 3318.72
[ __ ] all of you I'm gonna rest on my

3315.119 --> 3321.48
[ __ ] constitutional right of social

3318.72 --> 3324.0
welfare which is literally in the

3321.48 --> 3327.9
Constitution for Baton you have the

3324.0 --> 3332.64
right on the minimum no questions

3327.9 --> 3335.2200000000003
yeah no conditions I am appealing to

3332.64 --> 3337.64
that right and I will never stop

3335.22 --> 3341.4599999999996
appealing to that right until I can

3337.64 --> 3343.2799999999997
naturally without being contracted to

3341.46 --> 3347.16
anybody else

3343.28 --> 3348.8390000000004
make the money to be able to get out of

3347.16 --> 3352.14
the welfare

3348.839 --> 3354.0
and until then I will appeal to that

3352.14 --> 3357.1189999999997
constitutional right that is

3354.0 --> 3359.48
unconditional and I will remain doing

3357.119 --> 3359.48
that

3360.839 --> 3366.48
and I do it because this is the way I

3363.599 --> 3369.02
think I can make the most out of my

3366.48 --> 3372.599
unique talents

3369.02 --> 3374.88
any other way and it will not work I

3372.599 --> 3377.7200000000003
will not be able to reveal the pick the

3374.88 --> 3377.7200000000003
peak insights

3378.599 --> 3381.079
anyway

3384.859 --> 3390.72
Who Wants To Be A Spiritual millionaire

3387.9 --> 3392.7000000000003
well that's already quantification I

3390.72 --> 3396.319
mean the spiritual currency there is no

3392.7 --> 3396.319
quantification there is no

3396.619 --> 3402.599
amounts

3398.579 --> 3406.8
it's just more or less that's that's

3402.599 --> 3409.76
what exists there's no numerical value

3406.8 --> 3409.76
within the spirit

3410.099 --> 3416.339
it's just more or less and you can only

3413.16 --> 3418.2599999999998
know by comparing so you could say that

3416.339 --> 3421.68
any values

3418.26 --> 3425.3390000000004
that could be attained or sized up or

3421.68 --> 3426.8999999999996
estimated within the spirit would be

3425.339 --> 3428.64
uh

3426.9 --> 3431.88
what do they call it again

3428.64 --> 3434.16
ratio based would be ratio based

3431.88 --> 3436.559
comparing one to the other and then you

3434.16 --> 3438.72
know this is more than that there's no

3436.559 --> 3442.44
numerical value involved in spirit

3438.72 --> 3444.48
currency it's just more

3442.44 --> 3447.619
or less

3444.48 --> 3447.619
ratio based

3450.72 --> 3456.66
right any numerical value that you that

3454.14 --> 3459.42
you put to it just do it in your mind

3456.66 --> 3461.8999999999996
and you will feel kind of stupid for it

3459.42 --> 3461.9
afterward

3462.059 --> 3466.98
I mean you won't feel like ashamed but

3464.28 --> 3470.0400000000004
you'll feel like it is kind of pointless

3466.98 --> 3472.98
like it Spirits spirit is not really

3470.04 --> 3475.5
like expressible in numerical value is

3472.98 --> 3477.3
it ironically that's also even part of

3475.5 --> 3480.0
the saying like

3477.3 --> 3483.0
you can express your spirit in numerical

3480.0 --> 3485.819
value you can't put a price

3483.0 --> 3488.9
to your soul literally like it is

3485.819 --> 3492.7799999999997
invaluable you can't you can't

3488.9 --> 3497.119
say this much if you do

3492.78 --> 3497.119
then you literally degrade

3497.52 --> 3502.74
the

3500.119 --> 3506.2200000000003
considerably infinite value of your

3502.74 --> 3508.4599999999996
spirit right it's not expressible in in

3506.22 --> 3508.4599999999996
numbers

3513.7 --> 3516.83
[Music]

3518.64 --> 3522.9
good thing with spiritual currencies you

3520.859 --> 3524.2799999999997
get to keep it not just you get to keep

3522.9 --> 3526.319
it turret

3524.28 --> 3527.7000000000003
there's interest

3526.319 --> 3531.619
yeah

3527.7 --> 3531.6189999999997
spiritual currency has interest

3533.04 --> 3536.2799999999997
Bank

3534.42 --> 3538.819
you get more

3536.28 --> 3538.8190000000004
huh

3544.5 --> 3549.079
it's it's the one currency

3550.38 --> 3559.1600000000003
that just it keeps creating itself like

3556.2 --> 3562.6189999999997
the idea that you like

3559.16 --> 3564.18
give away that you would decrease your

3562.619 --> 3567.299
spiritual currency

3564.18 --> 3569.52
to do something is kind of ridiculous

3567.299 --> 3573.54
when you think about it you never give

3569.52 --> 3577.14
away your spirit you just let it be as

3573.54 --> 3579.359
much as it is grow it and apply it it

3577.14 --> 3582.96
doesn't go away you just apply it it's

3579.359 --> 3585.0
just like it manifests it does its thing

3582.96 --> 3587.7
it's not gonna go away it's not

3585.0 --> 3590.819
depleting because of those actions

3587.7 --> 3593.819
now it isn't like physical money when

3590.819 --> 3597.359
you spend money that money is gone

3593.819 --> 3599.579
it's now metaphysically transformed into

3597.359 --> 3601.5
what you spent it on

3599.579 --> 3603.54
with Spirit currency doesn't work like

3601.5 --> 3607.02
that

3603.54 --> 3609.359
you just have it and you apply it it

3607.02 --> 3611.88
doesn't go away it's not how it works it

3609.359 --> 3614.819
only goes away if you let if you give it

3611.88 --> 3617.2200000000003
away if you trade it

3614.819 --> 3623.0589999999997
if you downsize it if you allow yourself

3617.22 --> 3623.0589999999997
to downsize by any kind of rules

3623.94 --> 3631.26
that you impose upon yourself based on

3626.76 --> 3633.98
contractual obligation or whatever

3631.26 --> 3633.98
right

3639.0 --> 3645.74
Jesus and Buddha who are one of the most

3641.22 --> 3645.74
spiritual Niche which yeah yeah

3648.78 --> 3653.2200000000003
and I bet that they still had a lot of

3651.0 --> 3655.38
arguments together I mean I don't think

3653.22 --> 3658.2599999999998
I mean Jesus bought a very likely met

3655.38 --> 3660.2400000000002
but they also would

3658.26 --> 3663.059
I bet that they had some time together

3660.24 --> 3665.22
where they were epic but then as time

3663.059 --> 3667.079
passed that they would start to notice

3665.22 --> 3669.839
each other's differences and I bet that

3667.079 --> 3673.98
Jesus got really annoyed with Buddha for

3669.839 --> 3677.04
basically not recognizing evil

3673.98 --> 3680.099
for eventually like why do you always

3677.04 --> 3681.48
have to like deny that what is what it's

3680.099 --> 3684.54
like no

3681.48 --> 3687.18
yes evil might lead to good but it isn't

3684.54 --> 3691.579
good when it's evil

3687.18 --> 3691.5789999999997
and like we're fighting principalities

3691.799 --> 3697.14
right and the principalities come you're

3694.26 --> 3698.46
fighting the the evil like if you don't

3697.14 --> 3700.68
find the evil because you don't

3698.46 --> 3702.42
recognize it's evil one then the evil

3700.68 --> 3703.98
just takes you you let the evil just

3702.42 --> 3706.02
take you

3703.98 --> 3707.579
well then you do damage and you have to

3706.02 --> 3710.579
deal with it afterward

3707.579 --> 3712.1400000000003
and now you might then say Oh it's all

3710.579 --> 3714.059
the same like I just happened what

3712.14 --> 3715.5589999999997
happened well you still did that damage

3714.059 --> 3718.2000000000003
people are still going to see that you

3715.559 --> 3719.579
did that so now you've sinned and that's

3718.2 --> 3722.0989999999997
going to be associated with you like

3719.579 --> 3724.1600000000003
Jesus would like get issues with

3722.099 --> 3728.28
Buddha's reasoning

3724.16 --> 3730.5
it's like yeah neutrality no I'd like to

3728.28 --> 3733.799
emphasize more on like how good is good

3730.5 --> 3736.26
and how evil is evil that's my thing you

3733.799 --> 3740.28
know I'm Jesus Christ I that's what I do

3736.26 --> 3744.92
that's the clarity that I bring

3740.28 --> 3744.92
to know what is good and what is evil

3745.7 --> 3750.89
so that it cannot be misunderstood in

3748.92 --> 3752.94
the future

3750.89 --> 3754.92
[Music]

3752.94 --> 3758.16
Buddha believed that suffering was the

3754.92 --> 3760.02
root of all evil and that's idiocy

3758.16 --> 3762.0
that's not that's just wrong because

3760.02 --> 3765.2599999999998
suffering

3762.0 --> 3769.04
is the root of all growth

3765.26 --> 3772.619
suffering is the spark

3769.04 --> 3773.64
that will enable you to find a way

3772.619 --> 3775.619
through

3773.64 --> 3778.16
without suffering

3775.619 --> 3782.1600000000003
there is no

3778.16 --> 3786.1189999999997
matter excitation

3782.16 --> 3787.319
in order to do the thing that they can

3786.119 --> 3788.6400000000003
do

3787.319 --> 3792.48
yeah

3788.64 --> 3795.299
so Buddha was a fool

3792.48 --> 3798.119
if that's literally what he said

3795.299 --> 3800.96
if suffering is the root of all evil

3798.119 --> 3804.96
then

3800.96 --> 3806.28
growth is evil

3804.96 --> 3809.46
because

3806.28 --> 3812.2200000000003
without suffering there is no growth

3809.46 --> 3815.579
without suffering there are only only

3812.22 --> 3818.4199999999996
thing that spawns is delusion

3815.579 --> 3818.42
arrogance

3818.64 --> 3821.64
short-sightedness

3821.819 --> 3824.359
huh

3831.78 --> 3839.299
it's a bit deeper well maybe it is but

3835.74 --> 3839.299
everything I said is correct

3840.359 --> 3846.2
and as I said Jesus and Buddha were

3842.76 --> 3846.2000000000003
probably friends

3846.42 --> 3852.2400000000002
but it's only logical that eventually

3849.72 --> 3855.319
the differences would just make them go

3852.24 --> 3855.319
their own ways again

3855.599 --> 3860.1800000000003
because there are very distinct

3857.7 --> 3860.18
differences

3864.48 --> 3868.92
anyway I'm gonna take a bite of this

3866.28 --> 3870.7200000000003
croissant before it gets uh it is

3868.92 --> 3872.52
already cold damn it

3870.72 --> 3873.7799999999997
okay I'm gonna put it back in the oven

3872.52 --> 3877.04
then

3873.78 --> 3877.0400000000004
we'll be right back

3895.52 --> 3899.849
[Music]

3906.96 --> 3910.349
[Music]

3916.859 --> 3921.839
okay

3919.14 --> 3924.5
all right

3921.839 --> 3928.339
right hope you guys uh are finding this

3924.5 --> 3928.339
1700th show interesting

3929.099 --> 3932.099
foreign

3940.799 --> 3946.02
I should put some of this subject in the

3943.2 --> 3948.72
title to maybe the model for non-local

3946.02 --> 3950.46
holographic excitation it was kind of a

3948.72 --> 3954.24
bluff anyway because I don't actually

3950.46 --> 3956.099
have a model for that it's just that I

3954.24 --> 3958.4399999999996
kind of want to have that model but I

3956.099 --> 3960.98
don't have it

3958.44 --> 3960.98
hmm

3961.38 --> 3964.52
hey dank thanks

3965.4 --> 3968.059
okay

3973.11 --> 3976.719
[Music]

3977.52 --> 3988.9
[Applause]

3991.079 --> 3995.28
yeah I'll add this

3993.72 --> 3998.339
because I like this was a very

3995.28 --> 4000.079
interesting subject that I did not

3998.339 --> 4003.5589999999997
anticipate happening

4000.079 --> 4007.1600000000003
but yeah sub photonic Computing and

4003.559 --> 4010.119
spiritual currency cannot be Quantified

4007.16 --> 4010.1189999999997
isn't that a good one

4010.46 --> 4016.119
isn't that interesting as a title guys

4013.46 --> 4016.119
what do you think

4022.46 --> 4027.2
right

4024.2 --> 4030.9199999999996
and I love it that I literally just

4027.2 --> 4033.4399999999996
actually explained exactly how and why

4030.92 --> 4035.1800000000003
it cannot be Quantified and I'm kind of

4033.44 --> 4036.7000000000003
impressed by myself that I have to say

4035.18 --> 4039.98
so myself

4036.7 --> 4042.5589999999997
for being able to do that

4039.98 --> 4046.18
I mean I can't explain things that are

4042.559 --> 4046.1800000000003
like incredibly complicated

4046.22 --> 4049.8799999999997
that most people they can't think about

4048.2 --> 4052.46
it they might even understand some of it

4049.88 --> 4055.1600000000003
but they still like they don't see like

4052.46 --> 4057.7400000000002
the important details and how the

4055.16 --> 4060.74
pattern of it all works until

4057.74 --> 4062.5389999999998
maybe you have already on your own but I

4060.74 --> 4065.0
definitely contribute to this to those

4062.539 --> 4066.5
that don't see those details but

4065.0 --> 4068.42
basically it's like here's the framework

4066.5 --> 4071.119
on how to look at the whole thing see

4068.42 --> 4073.06
see how it all makes sense now

4071.119 --> 4075.26
I do that

4073.06 --> 4078.2599999999998
[Music]

4075.26 --> 4080.539
and I think I'm I'm I'm decently good at

4078.26 --> 4083.42
it would you not say

4080.539 --> 4085.039
I certainly get enough responses from

4083.42 --> 4089.42
people

4085.039 --> 4091.76
to tell me that I am I am succeeding

4089.42 --> 4095.119
in making things comprehensible which is

4091.76 --> 4096.859
like one of my life's missions Universal

4095.119 --> 4099.259
just with everything making things

4096.859 --> 4103.299
understandable

4099.259 --> 4103.299
that's that's my life job

4103.64 --> 4108.799
like it doesn't even matter what it is

4105.98 --> 4112.12
it's just make things comprehensible

4108.799 --> 4112.12
whatever it is

4119.5 --> 4125.98
how long did it take to reach 1 million

4122.54 --> 4125.98
views of I don't remember

4126.38 --> 4131.2390000000005
any low fruit

4129.319 --> 4132.189
I don't even know how many views I got

4131.239 --> 4135.489
let me check

4132.189 --> 4135.4890000000005
[Music]

4144.38 --> 4147.52
why do you see that

4148.04 --> 4150.94
foreign

4151.0 --> 4154.239
tics right

4155.779 --> 4158.799000000001
for a few

4164.299 --> 4168.04
why do you just see the total

4168.739 --> 4176.259
why is it so difficult to just

4171.679 --> 4176.259
wait ah here it is Lifetime

4177.98 --> 4184.48
what uh yeah I haven't reached a million

4180.799 --> 4184.48
views apparently according to

4185.06 --> 4188.9800000000005
the channel analytics I'm at

4189.04 --> 4194.9
515

4190.96 --> 4199.4800000000005
704 views

4194.9 --> 4199.48
okay that's what it says

4204.98 --> 4211.16
there apparently Peak viewing

4208.04 --> 4213.56
happened around 2019 the most that's

4211.16 --> 4216.46
when I got Peak viewing after that it

4213.56 --> 4216.46
kind of died off

4219.2 --> 4223.699
[Music]

4221.6 --> 4227.08
so maybe that was like the 2019

4223.699 --> 4227.08
conference that caused that

4229.88 --> 4232.659000000001
I don't know

4235.34 --> 4240.82
according to a site I have

4238.219 --> 4240.82
what

4241.04 --> 4245.08
what side are you talking about

4252.199 --> 4256.46
you were here and they were you really

4254.42 --> 4258.26
well I know that you were like I

4256.46 --> 4261.159
remember you being there like in the

4258.26 --> 4261.159000000001
flatter talks days

4261.62 --> 4265.46
I'd have to check the live chat if it

4263.84 --> 4268.719
even is still there on like the first

4265.46 --> 4268.719
letter talks to know

4270.62 --> 4276.88
tours that you do

4273.98 --> 4276.879999999999
hell is that

4277.52 --> 4281.5
oh my God the [ __ ]

4289.76 --> 4292.76
okay

4297.95 --> 4301.09
[Music]

4303.4 --> 4307.54
my net worth is

4308.02 --> 4314.0
2858 dollars

4311.54 --> 4316.46
that's like nothing

4314.0 --> 4319.76
bro

4316.46 --> 4324.92
by that standard like

4319.76 --> 4327.92
my video output is like lower than like

4324.92 --> 4330.82
some third world country streamer that's

4327.92 --> 4330.82
like absurd

4332.54 --> 4338.0
wow

4334.52 --> 4340.280000000001
I make two dollar a day it's literally

4338.0 --> 4343.179
third world country

4340.28 --> 4343.179
the [ __ ]

4347.48 --> 4353.739
are these stats purely based on like the

4350.659 --> 4353.739
YouTube income

4354.8 --> 4357.64
hmm

4381.62 --> 4385.9
right but yeah Terry I don't know where

4383.78 --> 4388.82
the hell they get the

4385.9 --> 4392.219999999999
1461 videos because

4388.82 --> 4395.728999999999
like blatantly not true

4392.22 --> 4395.729
[Music]

4402.56 --> 4406.3
it's not the latest update okay

4416.84 --> 4422.06
707

4419.84 --> 4424.46
backup chat well that's a fair

4422.06 --> 4425.900000000001
assessment 707

4424.46 --> 4428.0
yeah it is

4425.9 --> 4431.239
you gotta realize some showers have been

4428.0 --> 4434.12
split apart because of Internet cutoffs

4431.239 --> 4436.639999999999
and the Flat Earth talks

4434.12 --> 4439.599999999999
which were like 60 shows or something

4436.64 --> 4439.6
and I

4439.699 --> 4444.46
I of course skipped three months

4444.739 --> 4448.12
so that all makes sense

4449.06 --> 4454.780000000001
I think I'm a good teacher oh thanks

4471.679 --> 4476.3
want to do that you want to do that I

4473.36 --> 4480.4
mean so many people do that I'm just

4476.3 --> 4480.400000000001
like so freaking bored

4483.82 --> 4490.099999999999
alrighty then well at least the YouTube

4486.739 --> 4493.239
video didn't get cut off

4490.1 --> 4493.2390000000005
so I'm back

4497.84 --> 4500.860000000001
yeah I was internet

4501.32 --> 4504.94
all right what that was I saying

4510.32 --> 4516.28
whatever

4512.48 --> 4516.28
I'm gonna get my Illuminati Castle

4524.239 --> 4527.239
questions

4573.85 --> 4577.02
[Music]

4590.239 --> 4592.9
thank you

4598.75 --> 4605.12
[Music]

4607.28 --> 4609.88
okay

4616.1 --> 4619.2390000000005
[Music]

4630.08 --> 4633.08
hmm

4654.32 --> 4659.299999999999
okay A little addendum I wanted the

4657.38 --> 4661.58
ratio based

4659.3 --> 4663.1990000000005
part in the title concerning spiritual

4661.58 --> 4665.659
currency because it's really important

4663.199 --> 4668.0
it's a it's an important realization

4665.659 --> 4671.739
that it is ratio based just like

4668.0 --> 4671.739
chemistry isn't that interesting

4675.26 --> 4680.719
right so now it's

4677.9 --> 4682.179
sub photonic Computing and spiritual

4680.719 --> 4685.58
currency

4682.179 --> 4688.52
non-quantifiable ratio based

4685.58 --> 4690.5
I wish I could have put like sentence

4688.52 --> 4692.900000000001
words in there but I mean I can only fit

4690.5 --> 4694.94
100 characters so

4692.9 --> 4699.219
this is the best I could make out of it

4694.94 --> 4701.839999999999
having all the keywords present

4699.219 --> 4703.76
all right anyway

4701.84 --> 4708.219
what do you want about

4703.76 --> 4708.219
net worth of Simon bro

4708.5 --> 4714.94
I don't care like let him freaking drown

4712.64 --> 4714.9400000000005
man

4716.179 --> 4721.159
you know who's probably worth a lot more

4718.64 --> 4722.659000000001
even look at freaking Tim pool look at

4721.159 --> 4724.699
where he is at

4722.659 --> 4727.0599999999995
does he look like he's happy with all

4724.699 --> 4727.0599999999995
that money

4731.6 --> 4736.52
bro I like I don't

4734.179 --> 4738.86
care you shouldn't care like oh that's

4736.52 --> 4742.6990000000005
disgusting that this scumbag has that

4738.86 --> 4745.94
one like laugh at it it's like ah that

4742.699 --> 4748.219
[ __ ] [ __ ] he got himself cursed

4745.94 --> 4750.199
he was dumb enough

4748.219 --> 4755.2390000000005
to trade

4750.199 --> 4760.9
the invaluable spiritual currency

4755.239 --> 4760.9
to for a bunch of dumb physical money

4761.179 --> 4765.52
like that happened it happened

4765.8 --> 4771.14
right and now he's gonna have to be

4767.9 --> 4774.32
somebody that's wealthy

4771.14 --> 4776.360000000001
that nobody nobody respects them yeah

4774.32 --> 4780.5199999999995
you know how much it sucks to be wealthy

4776.36 --> 4780.5199999999995
and have everybody not respect you

4783.14 --> 4785.7390000000005
sucks

4793.32 --> 4797.36
[Music]

4795.26 --> 4800.0
to go back and watch it started yeah low

4797.36 --> 4803.739
freed no definitely do it so it's been a

4800.0 --> 4803.739
great show overall great show

4804.32 --> 4808.759999999999
and I intended it to be I thought like

4806.48 --> 4810.32
70 I'm gonna make this special and when

4808.76 --> 4813.1990000000005
I say I'm gonna make it special that

4810.32 --> 4815.96
does me oh I'm gonna put on some stupid

4813.199 --> 4818.0
cloak or whatever be goofy or oh

4815.96 --> 4819.8
something think no I'm just gonna make

4818.0 --> 4823.76
it a really good show

4819.8 --> 4825.5
because I build up to it yesterday was

4823.76 --> 4828.679
the start of it and I knew like I'm

4825.5 --> 4831.86
gonna this is gonna be a big one

4828.679 --> 4836.5
and it is very interesting stuff both

4831.86 --> 4840.32
physics related like physics on the edge

4836.5 --> 4842.12
theorizing On The Edge on what is on the

4840.32 --> 4843.259999999999
edge of what is known about the physical

4842.12 --> 4846.08
world

4843.26 --> 4847.9400000000005
and then at the same time some spiritual

4846.08 --> 4850.64
banking like hey a spiritual currency

4847.94 --> 4853.699
how does it actually work how can you

4850.64 --> 4855.9800000000005
judge people size them up not

4853.699 --> 4859.4
necessarily judge

4855.98 --> 4860.78
as in judicial but size up like where

4859.4 --> 4862.82
are they at that their spiritual

4860.78 --> 4864.5
currency versus their actual money

4862.82 --> 4867.44
currency what does actual money currency

4864.5 --> 4870.26
do to you like what is real about it

4867.44 --> 4872.48
people have ideas about money and wealth

4870.26 --> 4873.320000000001
but do they actually know what it is

4872.48 --> 4875.36
like

4873.32 --> 4877.88
if you'd have like their real

4875.36 --> 4880.4
sensitivity the empathy type sensitivity

4877.88 --> 4883.28
senses

4880.4 --> 4885.5599999999995
and you'd meet a rich person like some

4883.28 --> 4889.099999999999
of those they like to flaunt around in

4885.56 --> 4890.0
movies or whatever you can feel their

4889.1 --> 4892.52
pain

4890.0 --> 4897.44
they might look all fabulous and all

4892.52 --> 4899.96
that all but you'll feel the pain

4897.44 --> 4901.339999999999
oozing off them

4899.96 --> 4905.719
because

4901.34 --> 4906.82
in my entire life the more wealthy the

4905.719 --> 4911.9
person

4906.82 --> 4915.86
the more they are in pain that's my

4911.9 --> 4918.139999999999
personal actual experience with other

4915.86 --> 4921.259999999999
people

4918.14 --> 4923.2390000000005
the ones that felt the best

4921.26 --> 4925.76
and the most

4923.239 --> 4928.28
relieved like the greatest were always

4925.76 --> 4930.9800000000005
the poor guys

4928.28 --> 4934.159
the ones that had all the hope all the

4930.98 --> 4937.218999999999
room in their head all the

4934.159 --> 4941.32
positive trusts in the good nature of

4937.219 --> 4941.32
people though are the poor guys

4941.719 --> 4946.34
the rich guys

4943.42 --> 4948.38
they never trust anybody because they're

4946.34 --> 4950.7390000000005
so used to everybody just trying to pick

4948.38 --> 4953.36
off them like vultures

4950.739 --> 4955.159
manipulate them to get them to do things

4953.36 --> 4956.78
all the time

4955.159 --> 4959.12
they're in pain

4956.78 --> 4962.42
their life sucks and they know it the

4959.12 --> 4963.26
really wise rich people they know it and

4962.42 --> 4965.6
they

4963.26 --> 4967.58
teach their kids very carefully

4965.6 --> 4969.92
carefully like

4967.58 --> 4972.92
most rich people don't really force

4969.92 --> 4974.659
their kids to like you have to take over

4972.92 --> 4976.88
my business

4974.659 --> 4981.04
because it sucks and they don't want

4976.88 --> 4981.04
their kids to live a life that sucks

4984.92 --> 4990.7390000000005
right A lot of the times

4987.199 --> 4992.96
a rich guy will like oh I'll do I'll

4990.739 --> 4995.0
I'll take that fall for the rest of the

4992.96 --> 4997.159
family I'll build the wealth so that the

4995.0 --> 4998.54
rest can actually do what what makes

4997.159 --> 5000.58
them happy

4998.54 --> 5002.679
happens too a lot of

5000.58 --> 5004.84
people that build a lot of wealth do

5002.679 --> 5006.88
that too it's really the ones that just

5004.84 --> 5009.159000000001
keep going and going and going that just

5006.88 --> 5011.62
force their family to get sucked in with

5009.159 --> 5013.54
it like Banker families and such like

5011.62 --> 5015.219
it's like no you are going to be part of

5013.54 --> 5018.5199999999995
this business

5015.219 --> 5019.719
or like you're or like you're going to

5018.52 --> 5021.6990000000005
be written out of the will because

5019.719 --> 5023.38
there's like too much riding on this

5021.699 --> 5026.62
this is just a family business

5023.38 --> 5028.4800000000005
responsibility then right like you're

5026.62 --> 5031.0599999999995
far part of that family business you're

5028.48 --> 5032.678999999999
gonna pay that spiritual currency then

5031.06 --> 5035.320000000001
you're gonna pay it just like everybody

5032.679 --> 5037.3
else that's part of that because now you

5035.32 --> 5038.5599999999995
have this mission to uphold that is

5037.3 --> 5041.320000000001
there

5038.56 --> 5043.860000000001
to maintain the wealth your family has

5041.32 --> 5043.86
amassed

5044.679 --> 5048.76
and you're soon gonna find yourself in

5046.84 --> 5052.96
positions where you have to do things

5048.76 --> 5055.659000000001
that are deplorable

5052.96 --> 5058.78
but you can't question this because if

5055.659 --> 5061.48
you went against doing that

5058.78 --> 5064.199
like all the power within the family

5061.48 --> 5064.199
blows up

5067.9 --> 5070.44
anyway

5075.64 --> 5079.96
right

5077.44 --> 5082.659
so and look

5079.96 --> 5085.719
just because wealthy people in my

5082.659 --> 5088.179
experience are all under pain compared

5085.719 --> 5091.9
to the poorer people doesn't mean that

5088.179 --> 5095.5
you cannot have actual wealth

5091.9 --> 5098.94
and and be doomed to always suffer pain

5095.5 --> 5098.94
it's not like that

5099.28 --> 5105.58
it is just like that most of the time

5101.4 --> 5107.099999999999
you can actually attain big amounts of

5105.58 --> 5110.62
money

5107.1 --> 5114.159000000001
and not become corrupted by it

5110.62 --> 5117.5199999999995
but it's only if you basically follow

5114.159 --> 5118.54
one very specific instruction for

5117.52 --> 5122.26
yourself

5118.54 --> 5124.36
that is that you regard the money

5122.26 --> 5127.12
as a means to an end

5124.36 --> 5129.04
the only way you can prevent money from

5127.12 --> 5131.159
completely corrupting your spirit like

5129.04 --> 5133.96
that when it becomes in a huge quantity

5131.159 --> 5136.36
is if you just see it as coming and

5133.96 --> 5139.0
going if you don't see it as I have this

5136.36 --> 5140.92
wealth but no it's something that's

5139.0 --> 5142.78
happening it's just changing something

5140.92 --> 5146.14
around you

5142.78 --> 5149.259999999999
like it's not really yours

5146.14 --> 5152.02
I mean you have control over it but it's

5149.26 --> 5153.88
just that it's just something happening

5152.02 --> 5155.860000000001
right

5153.88 --> 5158.08
and then you can like use money to

5155.86 --> 5158.92
change things perhaps for the better and

5158.08 --> 5160.9
all that

5158.92 --> 5165.219
but

5160.9 --> 5169.0
the money itself doesn't become

5165.219 --> 5170.8
isolated and it doesn't attain its own

5169.0 --> 5173.26
spiritual life

5170.8 --> 5175.719
in your mind

5173.26 --> 5177.820000000001
it's just a means to an end and if you

5175.719 --> 5180.28
see it like that then you can certainly

5177.82 --> 5182.139
have giant amounts of wealth involved or

5180.28 --> 5184.84
like through a business right you become

5182.139 --> 5186.6990000000005
a suddenly out of nowhere it's like you

5184.84 --> 5188.56
attain managing position because people

5186.699 --> 5190.36
really respected your talents and

5188.56 --> 5191.679
insights and you're going to do these

5190.36 --> 5194.0199999999995
things then suddenly it's like yeah you

5191.679 --> 5195.52
get a big salary all of a sudden it's

5194.02 --> 5198.1
like oh you get to make all these big

5195.52 --> 5199.719
decisions even with money it's gonna

5198.1 --> 5202.860000000001
seduce you it's gonna stare you in the

5199.719 --> 5206.139
face like oh you're the big shot now

5202.86 --> 5209.32
oh you are better you're better than

5206.139 --> 5211.36
ever yeah you have to face that then

5209.32 --> 5213.82
but if you ignore all that and you just

5211.36 --> 5216.339999999999
say no no it's like it's nothing it's

5213.82 --> 5218.5
just [ __ ] money is just [ __ ] it's just a

5216.34 --> 5221.02
means to an end it's just

5218.5 --> 5223.42
it's not the money it's the thing that's

5221.02 --> 5225.1
gonna be done with it that's the thing

5223.42 --> 5227.62
that's the real thing

5225.1 --> 5231.58
the money is nothing it doesn't exist to

5227.62 --> 5233.86
me it's just a means to an end

5231.58 --> 5235.659
well if you have that attitude towards

5233.86 --> 5237.28
money then you can deal with large

5235.659 --> 5240.46
quantities

5237.28 --> 5243.12
with much less risk of it corrupting

5240.46 --> 5243.12
your soul

5248.92 --> 5255.9400000000005
and I really wish I would have had that

5252.28 --> 5259.42
Insight well to that Clarity level when

5255.94 --> 5260.98
I actually inherited my mother's money

5259.42 --> 5262.42
because

5260.98 --> 5265.12
I didn't

5262.42 --> 5265.96
and I really did think I was suddenly

5265.12 --> 5268.84
better

5265.96 --> 5270.219
than other people because I had all this

5268.84 --> 5271.78
freedom

5270.219 --> 5274.659
even though it was relatively

5271.78 --> 5276.4
short-lived and kind of a embarrassment

5274.659 --> 5278.92
afterward

5276.4 --> 5280.839999999999
I did learn a lot though I learned a lot

5278.92 --> 5283.9800000000005
about myself I learned a lot about what

5280.84 --> 5283.9800000000005
is actually possible

5285.58 --> 5291.699
when you're in that position

5288.52 --> 5294.52
but I definitely also felt that the

5291.699 --> 5297.759999999999
money itself and that that freedom like

5294.52 --> 5301.0
that that it did corrupt me and it it

5297.76 --> 5303.58
was gonna like try to manipulate me to

5301.0 --> 5305.76
like ensure that it's gonna stay like

5303.58 --> 5305.76
that

5306.52 --> 5312.9400000000005
and I I didn't give in to that

5310.42 --> 5315.46
because I was actually for a while

5312.94 --> 5318.4
seduced to invest some of that money

5315.46 --> 5321.12
into the medical industrial complex and

5318.4 --> 5321.12
I'm talking about

5321.48 --> 5325.48
2009 2010.

5325.9 --> 5331.239
so it was well before the medic yeah

5328.6 --> 5333.76
before the great medical experiment

5331.239 --> 5336.099999999999
but even knowing like yeah they do

5333.76 --> 5338.860000000001
vaccine and [ __ ] and like

5336.1 --> 5341.8
flu shots and [ __ ] I knew it was bad but

5338.86 --> 5344.679
it was seduced for a bit like yeah but

5341.8 --> 5347.8
but I I need to make sure this money

5344.679 --> 5349.9
just does doesn't just go away so I was

5347.8 --> 5352.54
actually seduced

5349.9 --> 5354.28
internally for a while but I never gave

5352.54 --> 5356.62
into it

5354.28 --> 5360.46
and just so like I know I'm just gonna

5356.62 --> 5364.239
focus on I'm just using this moment to

5360.46 --> 5366.28
to create things and to create ideas and

5364.239 --> 5370.239
styles and

5366.28 --> 5373.179
and find my identity also within my own

5370.239 --> 5375.879999999999
creativity like what is it that I do

5373.179 --> 5379.54
what is my style

5375.88 --> 5383.08
also like in spiritual things what is my

5379.54 --> 5385.96
actual style if I see myself as a shaman

5383.08 --> 5390.46
what is my style

5385.96 --> 5394.0
so that's what I really spent most of my

5390.46 --> 5396.52
attention on in those times

5394.0 --> 5400.0
instead of obsessing over how I could

5396.52 --> 5402.1
manage to maintain the wealth

5400.0 --> 5404.56
and yeah

5402.1 --> 5407.320000000001
on one hand I think it was time well

5404.56 --> 5408.6990000000005
spent on the other I still am kind of

5407.32 --> 5412.679
sorry that

5408.699 --> 5412.678999999999
I didn't try something

5413.02 --> 5419.92
I should have tried something to make it

5416.44 --> 5423.159
decrease less so that I would eventually

5419.92 --> 5425.26
build up enough wisdom to actually know

5423.159 --> 5428.86
how to properly apply it instead of just

5425.26 --> 5430.84
sitting on it seeing it slowly go away

5428.86 --> 5433.54
because that's kind of what I did with

5430.84 --> 5436.06
it I just sat on it and just spent it's

5433.54 --> 5439.06
as slow as I could but it did go away

5436.06 --> 5439.06
terrible

5440.02 --> 5443.7390000000005
any Graveler that's gonna hear that's

5441.76 --> 5446.62
gonna have like oh why did you have to

5443.739 --> 5448.78
say that that's just horrifying

5446.62 --> 5451.42
I'm just sitting on the money letting it

5448.78 --> 5452.98
slowly disappear that's like torture how

5451.42 --> 5456.54
dare you Arwin

5452.98 --> 5456.54
you never deserve that money

5464.679 --> 5471.719

5655.48 --> 5660.759999999999
that is messed up dude

5658.78 --> 5664.36
yeah it sounds like he had a bit of a

5660.76 --> 5667.54
Dark World Vision premonition of hell

5664.36 --> 5670.239
so that's the hell

5667.54 --> 5673.239
that's gonna wait for him

5670.239 --> 5675.5199999999995
or rather it is the hell that is now an

5673.239 --> 5678.58
existence parallel

5675.52 --> 5681.0
to his life like that's now

5678.58 --> 5681.0
there

5681.58 --> 5684.9
heavy [ __ ] indeed

5689.86 --> 5694.96
I've had Visions like that too by the

5692.44 --> 5697.659
way but never when I've never actually

5694.96 --> 5699.46
created corpses like that

5697.659 --> 5703.62
it's just that

5699.46 --> 5703.62
I created a lot of weakness

5705.76 --> 5711.9400000000005
I got like nightmare Visions because of

5710.139 --> 5714.52
my weakness

5711.94 --> 5716.5599999999995
it's like yeah you could do so much more

5714.52 --> 5718.120000000001
you did nothing you did nothing or when

5716.56 --> 5719.860000000001
you did nothing when you were young you

5718.12 --> 5723.4
were a [ __ ] coward

5719.86 --> 5726.639
and I regret this heavily

5723.4 --> 5730.239
in retrospect I wish I

5726.639 --> 5732.04
like in my mind now I wish I would have

5730.239 --> 5734.259999999999
done it completely different and it

5732.04 --> 5736.36
would have been very well worth it to

5734.26 --> 5739.6
literally bleed

5736.36 --> 5743.44
for having made more effort

5739.6 --> 5745.900000000001
but no I was so [ __ ] scared I was so

5743.44 --> 5749.62
scared

5745.9 --> 5752.5599999999995
[ __ ] little coward

5749.62 --> 5754.719
I wish I had somebody around me that had

5752.56 --> 5757.4800000000005
would have been actually Brave that

5754.719 --> 5759.1
would have like dragged me along

5757.48 --> 5761.199
I didn't

5759.1 --> 5763.96
everybody I [ __ ] knew was all a

5761.199 --> 5766.48
coward every [ __ ] person in my

5763.96 --> 5771.46
[ __ ] life that I knew was a complete

5766.48 --> 5774.699
[ __ ] coward every [ __ ] person

5771.46 --> 5777.12
everyone I ever knew was a [ __ ]

5774.699 --> 5777.12
coward

5781.239 --> 5786.36
so who the hell could I even pulled

5783.639 --> 5786.36
myself up to

5787.54 --> 5793.36
people I didn't know

5789.639 --> 5796.96
people on the on Natalie

5793.36 --> 5800.679
on the internet yeah well no [ __ ]

5796.96 --> 5804.42
person I ever knew in person was not a

5800.679 --> 5804.42
[ __ ] coward for some reason

5809.8 --> 5814.78
ah you got archive 81

5811.84 --> 5817.62
[ __ ] creepy yeah

5814.78 --> 5817.62
I know

5818.92 --> 5822.0
intense right

5828.28 --> 5832.54
you get the feeling though right

5830.62 --> 5835.12
I mean there's some [ __ ] in there

5832.54 --> 5838.86
there's some serious in plain cider

5835.12 --> 5838.86
called [ __ ] happening in that series

5841.48 --> 5846.159
like you can feel the Freemason

5843.52 --> 5848.1990000000005
symbology just dripping off the whole

5846.159 --> 5851.199
thing

5848.199 --> 5851.199
foreign

5855.179 --> 5861.1
just the whole occult stuff

5857.98 --> 5863.919999999999
like all bad stuff if theosophical

5861.1 --> 5867.04
Society all that is all like

5863.92 --> 5869.76
creepy [ __ ] up occult [ __ ]

5867.04 --> 5872.0199999999995
that's what that archive 81 is all about

5869.76 --> 5874.2390000000005
very interesting though

5872.02 --> 5877.4800000000005
do you own your failures

5874.239 --> 5880.12
are you blaming others

5877.48 --> 5882.299999999999
I'm just disappointed in reality in this

5880.12 --> 5882.3
case

5882.34 --> 5886.96
but hey I said I'm a [ __ ] coward

5885.159 --> 5890.679
first

5886.96 --> 5893.86
I got if I got the nightmare Visions

5890.679 --> 5896.26
like the hell visions that told me

5893.86 --> 5900.159
your negligent you're a [ __ ] coward

5896.26 --> 5902.62
you think I'm gonna blame other people

5900.159 --> 5904.96
I'm not a pathetic Grappler

5902.62 --> 5908.0199999999995
speeder

5904.96 --> 5911.5
I don't blame others for my own failures

5908.02 --> 5915.219
I'm just disappointed I I just wish I

5911.5 --> 5918.639
wish not everybody was a [ __ ] wussy

5915.219 --> 5921.28
and that I'd had somebody to pull up on

5918.639 --> 5923.9400000000005
and in a way for a while I did find

5921.28 --> 5929.0199999999995
somebody like that

5923.94 --> 5930.699
in 2010 I did find somebody like that

5929.02 --> 5933.580000000001
right

5930.699 --> 5936.4
who I even like explored a bit of Flat

5933.58 --> 5938.5
Earth and and physics

5936.4 --> 5940.54
he was actually the first guy that

5938.5 --> 5942.94
re-alerted me on the scientific method

5940.54 --> 5945.1
and how within University it's just not

5942.94 --> 5947.379999999999
being applied it's all astrophysics

5945.1 --> 5949.0
nonsense now that was before a flat

5947.38 --> 5951.76
Earth debate that was a guy I knew in

5949.0 --> 5954.4
2010 2011.

5951.76 --> 5956.7390000000005
he's the guy that had that book of Eric

5954.4 --> 5959.739
Dubai

5956.739 --> 5961.78
the Atlantean conspiracy in a time when

5959.739 --> 5963.759999999999
that wasn't even [ __ ] published and

5961.78 --> 5966.5199999999995
it's still a bizarre mystery to me like

5963.76 --> 5967.84
how is that physically possible how did

5966.52 --> 5970.659000000001
he have a book that wasn't even

5967.84 --> 5973.84
published yet what the [ __ ] is going on

5970.659 --> 5975.5199999999995
here right but he had that

5973.84 --> 5979.1990000000005
at this

5975.52 --> 5982.0
little meeting in his store

5979.199 --> 5985.178999999999
and Flat Earth was discussed in there

5982.0 --> 5987.58
this is like in 2011

5985.179 --> 5989.4400000000005
and then some Freemason weirdo with a

5987.58 --> 5992.92
lot of medals

5989.44 --> 5995.799999999999
like literally took him to the side I

5992.92 --> 5999.6990000000005
listened to that and the guy threatened

5995.8 --> 6002.42
to take his child it's like if you don't

5999.699 --> 6005.58
stop talking about this flatter thing

6002.42 --> 6007.26
like we're going to take your child when

6005.58 --> 6009.3
it's born

6007.26 --> 6012.179
and after that point the guy did not

6009.3 --> 6014.820000000001
want to ever discuss Flat Earth again

6012.179 --> 6017.159
that happened I can't really call him a

6014.82 --> 6019.5
coward but he was a guy that I was

6017.159 --> 6020.638999999999
pulling myself up on he was exactly what

6019.5 --> 6023.639
I needed

6020.639 --> 6025.38
and they broke him they literally broke

6023.639 --> 6029.1
him

6025.38 --> 6031.139
he only listened to is to uh Kent hovind

6029.1 --> 6033.6
after that point because he was very

6031.139 --> 6035.82
much about creationism

6033.6 --> 6037.9800000000005
but the Flat Earth is like no it's a

6035.82 --> 6041.48
it's a glow because don't ever talk

6037.98 --> 6041.48
about Flat Earth again to me

6045.239 --> 6049.58
very very traumatic for me

6058.5 --> 6063.84
I just

6060.06 --> 6067.320000000001
I should have just dude I should have

6063.84 --> 6069.360000000001
just done things and be very [ __ ]

6067.32 --> 6071.219
afraid and it's like yeah I'm gonna now

6069.36 --> 6073.32
stand on the street and start saying

6071.219 --> 6076.62
things loudly that I know are gonna

6073.32 --> 6078.54
terrify people I'm gonna sweat the [ __ ]

6076.62 --> 6080.4
out of me I'm gonna feel like this

6078.54 --> 6082.62
punching bag

6080.4 --> 6085.5
there's gonna be hammered by a bunch of

6082.62 --> 6087.84
people that are gonna just jump out of

6085.5 --> 6091.139
the bushes and just beat me to death and

6087.84 --> 6093.3
I should have just [ __ ] done it

6091.139 --> 6095.9400000000005
anyway

6093.3 --> 6098.1
just [ __ ] done it just done it in the

6095.94 --> 6100.98
attention in the news like walking

6098.1 --> 6103.320000000001
towards [ __ ] up news people and just

6100.98 --> 6105.599999999999
get in there and just say things

6103.32 --> 6107.34
like the [ __ ] Earth is flat this and

6105.6 --> 6109.139
that just I should have [ __ ] done it

6107.34 --> 6111.42
[ __ ] in their faces in their [ __ ]

6109.139 --> 6113.76
faces I wish I'd done that I wish I'd

6111.42 --> 6118.1990000000005
done it to the point where I got [ __ ]

6113.76 --> 6121.1990000000005
arrested for it I wish I'd done that

6118.199 --> 6124.28
instead of just being [ __ ] coward in

6121.199 --> 6124.28
the shadows all the time

6124.8 --> 6127.28
oh

6132.42 --> 6137.34
because if I had done that now I would

6134.76 --> 6140.280000000001
now have more credit I would now have

6137.34 --> 6143.28
something to brag about in my past I

6140.28 --> 6145.98
don't because I was a [ __ ] sniveling

6143.28 --> 6148.159
coward

6145.98 --> 6148.159
foreign

6185.84 --> 6190.619000000001
to leave your little turd in my chat do

6189.719 --> 6193.9800000000005
you

6190.619 --> 6196.86
Tim no you're out of here scum

6193.98 --> 6201.239

6196.86 --> 6205.199
I don't make things up I don't I swear

6201.239 --> 6209.28
it on my life may God strike me dead may

6205.199 --> 6211.5
I burn in hell for all eternity

6209.28 --> 6215.88
if I'm lying

6211.5 --> 6219.54
I had Eric's dubey's book the Atlantean

6215.88 --> 6223.02
conspiracy in my hand I still remember

6219.54 --> 6226.26
the feeling of the plastic cover of it

6223.02 --> 6229.4400000000005
on my hand I remember flicking through

6226.26 --> 6231.6
it I remember looking into it and then

6229.44 --> 6234.659
realizing that I didn't think it was

6231.6 --> 6237.96
written that well yeah that's how

6234.659 --> 6240.659
[ __ ] real it was there in my [ __ ]

6237.96 --> 6243.54
hands in 2011.

6240.659 --> 6246.239
it was there I don't give a [ __ ] if you

6243.54 --> 6248.5199999999995
believe it or not go [ __ ] yourself it

6246.239 --> 6250.759999999999
was there it was in my hands I know the

6248.52 --> 6250.76
location

6251.1 --> 6256.8
I know how I got there where how I went

6253.92 --> 6258.3
away from there it was all real all of

6256.8 --> 6261.06
it

6258.3 --> 6263.88
I can potentially contact the guy

6261.06 --> 6266.46
leaving out Flat Earth and ask him did

6263.88 --> 6269.159000000001
you did I did you really have that book

6266.46 --> 6272.119
back then did I really hold it and just

6269.159 --> 6272.119
to see what he would say

6273.199 --> 6280.5
thank you

6276.26 --> 6283.219
isn't he that guy from fpd trans yes

6280.5 --> 6286.38
yes he is

6283.219 --> 6289.08
he's the guy that tells you that nobody

6286.38 --> 6292.139
claims the geometric Horizon as he

6289.08 --> 6293.94
literally shows you what he claims is

6292.139 --> 6296.28
the geometric Horizon

6293.94 --> 6298.58
with a Drone footage flying over a flat

6296.28 --> 6298.58
plane

6299.699 --> 6304.28
yeah that's that Tim Osman that's him

6306.6 --> 6312.2390000000005
yeah but people like that are not

6309.719 --> 6315.4800000000005
welcome if they're just only there to

6312.239 --> 6319.5199999999995
say sounds made up because

6315.48 --> 6319.5199999999995
nobody gives a [ __ ] about you dude

6323.04 --> 6329.119
I know what I know

6325.56 --> 6329.119000000001
and I am telling it

6335.45 --> 6338.59
[Music]

6343.92 --> 6346.04
um

6362.659 --> 6369.199
isn't it slow mo

6365.76 --> 6369.1990000000005
let's just unhide him

6370.739 --> 6373.919999999999
it's basically not even a ban worthy

6373.08 --> 6376.08
thing

6373.92 --> 6378.96
it's just I [ __ ] hate it when people

6376.08 --> 6381.3
like never say anything and they just

6378.96 --> 6383.78
drop one [ __ ] sentence out of nowhere

6381.3 --> 6383.78
like that

6385.619 --> 6389.4
it's like if you're standing by all the

6387.84 --> 6390.84
time and that's the only thing you're

6389.4 --> 6392.94
gonna come out with

6390.84 --> 6395.96
in the real world dude I'd freaking

6392.94 --> 6395.96
punch you in the face

6398.88 --> 6403.88
or push your air push your ass into the

6401.699 --> 6403.879999999999
water

6407.82 --> 6410.96
go take a swim

6415.92 --> 6421.1990000000005
by the way I'm watching a bit of a new

6418.26 --> 6422.9400000000005
series on Netflix I seem to be finding

6421.199 --> 6424.98
all kinds

6422.94 --> 6427.138999999999
and this one is a little bit different

6424.98 --> 6429.78
tone it is

6427.139 --> 6434.179
not horror oriented

6429.78 --> 6434.179
it is very magical oriented though

6434.219 --> 6440.159
it's called lock and key and it's about

6436.56 --> 6443.52
basically this weird magical house

6440.159 --> 6446.638999999999
with magical keys in them that do

6443.52 --> 6449.639
literal magic I mean it is like oh the

6446.639 --> 6451.8
key of this heavy magical power a key of

6449.639 --> 6452.9400000000005
that and heavy magical power and the way

6451.8 --> 6457.76
they

6452.94 --> 6457.759999999999
use it it's very interesting

6459.119 --> 6462.78
it's very I thought it's very

6461.219 --> 6465.2390000000005
interesting the characters in it are

6462.78 --> 6467.159
very interesting I mean they have like a

6465.239 --> 6469.44
little boy in there

6467.159 --> 6471.96
and that little boy is kind of weird and

6469.44 --> 6474.659
he's really my kind of weird I really

6471.96 --> 6476.699
like that kid that kid kind of reminds

6474.659 --> 6480.599999999999
me of me in ways when I was little

6476.699 --> 6483.839999999999
because he's really freaking smart

6480.6 --> 6486.5
like I like that it's an actually smart

6483.84 --> 6486.5
little kid

6486.84 --> 6491.46
like I'm pretty sure he is also in the

6489.119 --> 6493.0199999999995
real world kind of smart it just looks

6491.46 --> 6496.5
like that

6493.02 --> 6497.6990000000005
and I like this series lock and lock and

6496.5 --> 6499.98
key

6497.699 --> 6502.739
so far I'm like in the third episode in

6499.98 --> 6505.638999999999
but it's like very intense there's like

6502.739 --> 6505.638999999999
a lot of things

6505.679 --> 6508.639
happening in there

6509.04 --> 6514.08
is interesting

6510.6 --> 6516.780000000001
that show is awesome you know that one

6514.08 --> 6519.179
I'd never seen that before

6516.78 --> 6521.46
I don't know how old it is

6519.179 --> 6524.219
but I decided to watch it it seems like

6521.46 --> 6526.92
it's very interesting

6524.219 --> 6528.84
very magical it it's like

6526.92 --> 6530.639
it could be like almost Dungeons and

6528.84 --> 6533.639
Dragons Magic

6530.639 --> 6536.46
like those those keys that they use I

6533.639 --> 6539.6
mean that seriously reminds me of like

6536.46 --> 6541.92
magical items that you can craft

6539.6 --> 6544.139
magically within Dungeons and Dragons

6541.92 --> 6546.32
It's like wow that is definitely a

6544.139 --> 6548.639
magical item that has that spell

6546.32 --> 6551.159
encounted into it and this is how it

6548.639 --> 6552.900000000001
works it's like well yeah that is just a

6551.159 --> 6555.44
Dungeons and Dragons magical items

6552.9 --> 6555.44
fascinating

6555.78 --> 6558.48
so yeah I'm looking forward to the rest

6557.639 --> 6560.88
of it

6558.48 --> 6562.98
well that is what I've been watching

6560.88 --> 6565.5
the last two days

6562.98 --> 6567.659
and at first I was like I never like

6565.5 --> 6569.1
tell about a series when I only watch

6567.659 --> 6571.259999999999
one show

6569.1 --> 6575.42
I have to watch more because sometimes

6571.26 --> 6575.42
the show just halfway starts to suck

6575.82 --> 6580.94
but with this one it doesn't seem like

6577.619 --> 6580.94
it it's very compelling

6583.26 --> 6590.159000000001
the head key is to yeah the freaking

6585.9 --> 6594.0
that but amazing though I mean seriously

6590.159 --> 6596.82
the head key you literally go into the

6594.0 --> 6598.139
Dark World representation of your inner

6596.82 --> 6603.0599999999995
self

6598.139 --> 6606.42
a [ __ ] amazing I mean

6603.06 --> 6607.56
those representations really aren't that

6606.42 --> 6609.719
far off

6607.56 --> 6612.4800000000005
as like having it

6609.719 --> 6615.119
an Ayahuasca trip into your inner mind

6612.48 --> 6617.599999999999
it's not that far off guys it really

6615.119 --> 6617.599999999999
isn't

6621.48 --> 6627.178999999999
it parents ever hire a magician or one

6625.08 --> 6629.699
of my birth no no we never had a

6627.179 --> 6631.679
magician we my parents didn't hire

6629.699 --> 6635.119
anybody

6631.679 --> 6635.119
as an Entertainer

6635.76 --> 6641.76
we didn't really do that because I just

6638.76 --> 6644.780000000001
be scared of the stranger I mean my

6641.76 --> 6644.780000000001
parents would do the thing

6649.619 --> 6654.78
and like besides you know all they

6652.56 --> 6658.02
really had to do is just like throw me

6654.78 --> 6660.0
some Legos and I'd be occupied for like

6658.02 --> 6662.52
10 hours

6660.0 --> 6666.48
so

6662.52 --> 6669.2390000000005
I was not easily bored as a kid

6666.48 --> 6671.839999999999
you just give me Legos and everything is

6669.239 --> 6671.839999999999
all right

6672.119 --> 6677.699
but uh

6674.4 --> 6679.5599999999995
no no they never like got a magician for

6677.699 --> 6681.9
tricks I never was a big fan of

6679.56 --> 6684.06
magicians tricks I don't like card and

6681.9 --> 6685.98
coin trick I don't like it I don't like

6684.06 --> 6689.52
any of it

6685.98 --> 6692.218999999999
I I just it I don't like it it's not

6689.52 --> 6694.139
because of a principle or I I just it

6692.219 --> 6697.56
doesn't feel right it's like I am

6694.139 --> 6700.82
annoyed I'm annoyed at at it I don't

6697.56 --> 6700.820000000001
like magician trickery

6701.52 --> 6707.639
I like actual magic that's what I like

6704.219 --> 6710.52
actual magic where it is like yeah can

6707.639 --> 6714.0
you feel that thing coming out of my

6710.52 --> 6718.040000000001
hand at 10 centimeter distance can you

6714.0 --> 6721.679
feel me feeling inside of your body yeah

6718.04 --> 6723.42
that magic that's actual man that's not

6721.679 --> 6725.88
a trick that's something that's actually

6723.42 --> 6727.32
happening actual magic yeah that's my

6725.88 --> 6730.8
thing

6727.32 --> 6732.84
right but my parents did at times when I

6730.8 --> 6735.54
was after 12

6732.84 --> 6737.52
after I was 12 they did like invite a

6735.54 --> 6740.699
couple of weird people

6737.52 --> 6742.860000000001
we got a guru one time and we yeah some

6740.699 --> 6744.78
freaking luciferians

6742.86 --> 6748.259999999999
I told you that story before that was

6744.78 --> 6749.5199999999995
[ __ ] weird man that was really weird

6748.26 --> 6753.179
so

6749.52 --> 6756.659000000001
we had like actual magicians not

6753.179 --> 6759.08
freaking parlor trick magicians but like

6756.659 --> 6762.619
actual people that claim to do magic

6759.08 --> 6762.619
cabalists and [ __ ]

6763.08 --> 6767.84
that's right Jews luciferians

6769.08 --> 6774.36
like

6770.36 --> 6774.36
Hindu priests

6779.159 --> 6782.28
that's the kind of thing I was really

6780.96 --> 6783.96
interested in

6782.28 --> 6786.0599999999995
have your magical abilities ever made

6783.96 --> 6789.119
independently verified

6786.06 --> 6790.860000000001
uh I'd love to

6789.119 --> 6796.46
sure

6790.86 --> 6796.46
but I mean it's hereditary my dad has it

6798.659 --> 6803.5199999999995
I recogn like I learned the trick

6801.659 --> 6805.679
actually for my first girlfriend who

6803.52 --> 6807.0
apparently was able to do that herself I

6805.679 --> 6809.9400000000005
didn't even know that

6807.0 --> 6811.5
then I became conscious of it then I

6809.94 --> 6814.919999999999
started like hey I can do this talk

6811.5 --> 6817.94
about it and then my dad's like yeah

6814.92 --> 6817.9400000000005
I do that too

6818.1 --> 6822.780000000001
so

6820.08 --> 6825.54
I genetically am disposed

6822.78 --> 6828.42
predisposed for being able to do it

6825.54 --> 6831.0
but I mean yeah I can absolutely verify

6828.42 --> 6832.5
like technically I don't even need to do

6831.0 --> 6835.38
it guys

6832.5 --> 6837.719
I use my ability on myself

6835.38 --> 6838.92
if I didn't have that ability I'd be

6837.719 --> 6843.179
[ __ ] dead

6838.92 --> 6846.179
because I've had a lot of pain yeah

6843.179 --> 6848.76
I've not been to a dentist

6846.179 --> 6851.52
in eight years I've literally had part

6848.76 --> 6855.119000000001
of my teeth falling out in the last few

6851.52 --> 6856.580000000001
years yeah multiple

6855.119 --> 6859.0199999999995
pain

6856.58 --> 6861.6
inflammations that got really terrible

6859.02 --> 6863.52
dude if I didn't have this ability I'd

6861.6 --> 6865.679
literally be dead

6863.52 --> 6868.52
okay

6865.679 --> 6871.38
because I don't take pain medication

6868.52 --> 6874.1
the only thing I take is my own

6871.38 --> 6874.1
magnetization

6877.199 --> 6882.0
that's what I do that's how I managed to

6879.96 --> 6883.86
avoid pain medication and its negative

6882.0 --> 6887.82
influences

6883.86 --> 6890.54
so but sure if somebody wants me to

6887.82 --> 6890.54
demonstrate

6890.76 --> 6896.159000000001
right I'd be up for that

6893.4 --> 6898.5
because I am a hundred percent assured

6896.159 --> 6901.0199999999995
that I'll have this ability until I'm

6898.5 --> 6902.699
dead or until my freaking hands get

6901.02 --> 6906.4800000000005
chopped off

6902.699 --> 6908.339999999999
until if let's just not say until just

6906.48 --> 6914.0
if

6908.34 --> 6914.0
because that would be intainable to me

6915.239 --> 6919.739
so I know what I can do

6917.82 --> 6922.46
and I am very well willing to

6919.739 --> 6922.459999999999
demonstrate it

6923.52 --> 6928.4400000000005
pain meds are the devil yeah I know

6926.52 --> 6930.719
right but I am gonna ground out the show

6928.44 --> 6933.119
now man this show has really flown by

6930.719 --> 6934.92
quickly

6933.119 --> 6938.46
how to measure the mat now first you

6934.92 --> 6942.02
have to pick up that it's there yeah

6938.46 --> 6942.02
first you have to know it's there

6944.82 --> 6951.42
right so let's say let's say as an

6947.94 --> 6954.08
example speeder somebody has a typical

6951.42 --> 6957.719
joint pain it's like

6954.08 --> 6961.0199999999995
boom out out right it's like oh my

6957.719 --> 6962.639
shoulder's bad The Joint you know that's

6961.02 --> 6965.88
gonna stay

6962.639 --> 6967.56
it's that day it's bad and maybe in a

6965.88 --> 6969.900000000001
few days it will be less right that's a

6967.56 --> 6971.580000000001
very typical scenario so somebody's like

6969.9 --> 6972.78
I

6971.58 --> 6975.3
sweat

6972.78 --> 6979.08
you can go to that person and I it's

6975.3 --> 6982.5
like oh okay let me feel that

6979.08 --> 6983.54
um right let me feel that all right now

6982.5 --> 6987.96
move it around

6983.54 --> 6990.48
oh oh that's going on oh I'm literally

6987.96 --> 6992.94
now getting shocks in my hand from

6990.48 --> 6994.678999999999
residual pains that I'm kind of used to

6992.94 --> 6997.799999999999
from my shoulder I'm literally by

6994.679 --> 6999.4800000000005
accident just actually ow doing that

6997.8 --> 7001.52
because I've had a lot of shoulder

6999.48 --> 7003.32
issues well guess what I could do that

7001.52 --> 7007.280000000001
with another person and they will

7003.32 --> 7010.46
literally as I do that move around and

7007.28 --> 7012.679
not feel any pain are winning and

7010.46 --> 7014.96
guarantee I guarantee it as they're

7012.679 --> 7017.0
moving around and I absorb any

7014.96 --> 7020.96
everything they will not feel the pain

7017.0 --> 7023.56
that's how literal it works

7020.96 --> 7023.56
right

7023.659 --> 7028.46
because I literally reroute the very

7026.78 --> 7030.08
impulse

7028.46 --> 7032.36
the tension

7030.08 --> 7033.98
that's causing that's like happening in

7032.36 --> 7036.86
the nerves in those region that is

7033.98 --> 7040.098999999999
registering pain I'm re-routing it

7036.86 --> 7042.739
I'm literally like bypassing the circuit

7040.099 --> 7045.619000000001
making it go somewhere else to my hand

7042.739 --> 7048.0199999999995
which then registers like it is having

7045.619 --> 7050.78
pain the exact same type

7048.02 --> 7052.88
because I'm taking the energy pulse that

7050.78 --> 7055.58
directly correlates with that form of

7052.88 --> 7057.7390000000005
pain so that's why in my hand I feel

7055.58 --> 7060.8
exactly the form of pain that is

7057.739 --> 7064.5199999999995
happening there because I

7060.8 --> 7066.08
miss it yeah make the energy go in

7064.52 --> 7068.42
another Direction

7066.08 --> 7071.599
getting absorbed by my hand instead of

7068.42 --> 7074.56
that region where it's being spawned

7071.599 --> 7077.119000000001
yeah that's what I can do

7074.56 --> 7079.099
and I'd love to demonstrate it to

7077.119 --> 7081.98
anybody who would be willing or

7079.099 --> 7084.88
interested to see and test it

7081.98 --> 7084.879999999999
right here

7086.36 --> 7091.4
wish you could do that with my knee

7089.719 --> 7093.5
I can try

7091.4 --> 7097.339999999999
there's one thing though

7093.5 --> 7100.699
I can absorb the pain all that I can't

7097.34 --> 7102.679
like absorbing it is not gonna make any

7100.699 --> 7104.239
standard situation that's happening

7102.679 --> 7106.88
there go away

7104.239 --> 7110.48
right the only thing I can do is make

7106.88 --> 7112.34
the inflammation stop but for example if

7110.48 --> 7113.419999999999
you have arthritis

7112.34 --> 7115.58
right

7113.42 --> 7116.9
I can't make your arthritis go away

7115.58 --> 7119.5599999999995
sorry

7116.9 --> 7119.5599999999995
actually

7119.78 --> 7126.0199999999995
I arguably am very very slowly

7123.4 --> 7128.839999999999
developing some arthritis which I'm not

7126.02 --> 7131.540000000001
exactly thrilled about but it was to be

7128.84 --> 7132.860000000001
expected my mother had it my grandmother

7131.54 --> 7135.44
had it

7132.86 --> 7137.839999999999
I just hope it's not gonna be very very

7135.44 --> 7139.759999999999
terrible and there's chances that it

7137.84 --> 7141.92
won't be that terrible because my diet

7139.76 --> 7144.9800000000005
is so much more conscious than

7141.92 --> 7148.639
of my mother and my grandmothers

7144.98 --> 7151.218999999999
because arthritis is like aggravated it

7148.639 --> 7153.46
gets worse by eating eating certain

7151.219 --> 7153.46
things

7153.56 --> 7159.080000000001
right so

7156.739 --> 7160.94
yeah I am actually gonna round out the

7159.08 --> 7162.619
show now I wish I could just go on

7160.94 --> 7166.28
forever

7162.619 --> 7168.98
but yeah that'll have to be tomorrow

7166.28 --> 7171.139
on a Saturday show I can do a Saturday

7168.98 --> 7173.299999999999
show maybe again four hours if it's

7171.139 --> 7175.219
gonna be this inspired I might just be

7173.3 --> 7179.54
