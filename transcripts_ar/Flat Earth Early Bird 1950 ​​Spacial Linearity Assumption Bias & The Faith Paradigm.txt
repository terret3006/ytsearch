281.68 --> 285.8
yeah I can certainly feel

295.12 --> 302.12
that kind of looks like it's going to be

297.479 --> 302.12
this kind of weather theed rest of the

303.36 --> 309.56
week warm but with rain and all that so

307.6 --> 313.47900000000004

had a really good sleep this

332.68 --> 336.52
time feel much more

338.62 --> 343.399
[Music]

349.759 --> 356.68
rested right so stuff has happened

353.36 --> 359.28000000000003
yesterday lots of that

356.68 --> 362.88
probably has has found your way has

359.28 --> 365.08
found it way to your

362.88 --> 367.319
attention like this attempt at

365.08 --> 371.19899999999996
assassination of the Slovakian prime

367.319 --> 371.199
minister that was pretty messed

372.4 --> 377.4
up now of course the

374.919 --> 379.919
painting I was there

377.4 --> 382.35999999999996
first but yeah that's all over the place

379.919 --> 385.479
and even they live truth has a review

382.36 --> 387.88
about it but I mean even Alex Jones

385.479 --> 390.8
reviewed it like

387.88 --> 392.36
that oh there's a bit demons in there I

390.8 --> 395.639
mean I don't even need to look for

392.36 --> 395.639
demons in that thing to

396.039 --> 402.88
just just feel

399.36 --> 405.039
it I mean actual demon faces in there

402.88 --> 406.96
and all that that's all super

405.039 --> 412.0
cute but I

406.96 --> 414.23999999999995
mean just look at it oh don't but you

412.0 --> 417.12
don't need to see any patterns in there

414.24 --> 421.44
to just feel that

417.12 --> 421.44
[ __ ] that's gross

423.879 --> 426.879
anyway

428.19 --> 431.31
[Music]

449.8 --> 453.40000000000003
yeah it's just the usual

459.199 --> 466.68
stuff this nonsense out there about

461.759 --> 466.68
supposed bird flu I mean it's it is just

472.52 --> 476.52
nonsense uh

505.52 --> 515.519
and of course the universal slogan just

510.12 --> 515.519
more people need to wake up oh

519.279 --> 527.399
really you think anymore

523.64 --> 529.72
could you think it's a matter of having

527.399 --> 532.279
to be confronted with information in

529.72 --> 535.36
order for you to wake up at this

532.279 --> 537.24
point or anybody out there that you

535.36 --> 539.04
might know like you really think that

537.24 --> 542.44
more information is going to change

539.04 --> 542.4399999999999
their mind minds or their

542.839 --> 548.36
attitudes at this point I don't know

545.839 --> 552.12
maybe it will maybe some people are

548.36 --> 555.88
just really not on top of things I don't

552.12 --> 558.279
know but I find the whole slogan a

555.88 --> 558.279
little

566.519 --> 571.36
tiresome anyway hey Thor

578.2 --> 583.1600000000001
KC yeah yeah that's a funny joke thanks

582.12 --> 585.72
for

583.16 --> 590.279
that when pigs

585.72 --> 595.12
fly and then swine flu right yeah you

590.279 --> 595.12
could think of it like that for sure

605.44 --> 610.0400000000001
I I I truly just don't understand what

608.279 --> 613.64
this

610.04 --> 616.519
whole idea about flu even is why why

613.64 --> 618.13
people are so damn afraid of that I just

616.519 --> 621.32
don't get it

618.13 --> 621.32
[Music]

634.88 --> 639.36
I mean at this point with everything

636.6 --> 642.24
that's happened and that anybody out

639.36 --> 646.12
there could witness about anybody around

642.24 --> 648.0790000000001
them is that you should just on an

646.12 --> 651.12
intuitive level be

648.079 --> 652.079
more afraid of medical interventions of

651.12 --> 655.04
some

652.079 --> 658.079
kind

655.04 --> 661.519
CU just like how many people that

658.079 --> 664.4799999999999
actually seek medical

661.519 --> 667.36
help versus the people that might get

664.48 --> 669.6800000000001
sick or whatever and that just like

667.36 --> 672.279
completely stick to

669.68 --> 674.6389999999999
themselves who you think on average is

672.279 --> 674.639
better

678.72 --> 683.1600000000001
off on the long run

683.76 --> 689.72
right I mean you got to see a pattern at

686.44 --> 689.72
some point

691.519 --> 695.639
anyway I didn't really want to talk

693.76 --> 699.76
about that but I mean it is like this

695.639 --> 703.0
ongoing issue and wh is trying

699.76 --> 706.279
to make its power

703.0 --> 711.519
move trying to take over the

706.279 --> 711.519
world with it's absolute nonsense

724.279 --> 730.48
right anyway yeah yesterday's show was

728.079 --> 733.079
hilarious it's been a it's been a while

730.48 --> 735.9200000000001
since I was able to get that silly

733.079 --> 740.4399999999999
without it being ruined

735.92 --> 742.5999999999999
somehow but yeah I managed and it was

740.44 --> 744.9200000000001
hilarious definitely not something I'm

742.6 --> 750.0790000000001
going to be doing every day

744.92 --> 750.079
but it was fun while it lasted

757.24 --> 762.9590000000001
here that refuses to go

759.639 --> 765.36
away door is open why did you just get

762.959 --> 765.3599999999999
out of

772.0 --> 776.68
here try catch it

793.12 --> 795.68
a damn

801.36 --> 804.9590000000001
it door is not

806.68 --> 810.68
helping open

810.88 --> 814.36
all right it's very windy out

822.12 --> 827.079
there

824.49 --> 831.72
[Music]

827.079 --> 831.7199999999999
anyhow got my coffee

831.92 --> 835.199
here

833.12 --> 839.199
[Music]

835.199 --> 842.199
my Illuminati C

839.199 --> 842.199
m

847.54 --> 850.63
[Music]

864.95 --> 868.349
[Music]

880.36 --> 884.279
right in the meantime the Earth is

885.399 --> 893.279
flat and most of the things

890.24 --> 897.759
that media and

893.279 --> 900.16
government try to unroll to try to stare

897.759 --> 904.1990000000001
our ways and

900.16 --> 908.48
control our minds to make us do

904.199 --> 908.4799999999999
things is mostly science

908.759 --> 916.12
fiction lots of Medical Science Fiction

912.36 --> 918.0790000000001
and of course the oldtime favorite

916.12 --> 922.5600000000001
the

918.079 --> 922.56
futuristic cosmological science

923.279 --> 928.68
fiction we'll get there one day we'll

926.04 --> 930.04
get to that magical non-existing place

928.68 --> 934.0
one

930.04 --> 938.079
day right we have all the CGI to keep

934.0 --> 938.079
you occupied and

938.199 --> 943.319
believing and I mean like I'm watching

940.68 --> 945.5999999999999
Star Trek Voyager again and it like it

943.319 --> 947.68
literally just makes me believe again

945.6 --> 950.1990000000001
while I'm watching that it's

947.68 --> 952.8389999999999
like the suspense of disbelief just

950.199 --> 952.8389999999999
works so

956.36 --> 961.92
well but yeah no knowing that the Earth

959.68 --> 964.56
is actually flat how I deal with it is

961.92 --> 968.519
just compartmentalize it I just like

964.56 --> 968.5189999999999
yeah that's the space

969.839 --> 976.6
world like a

972.12 --> 980.199
hypothetical room of how things work in

976.6 --> 983.44
which people just do things like as if

980.199 --> 983.4399999999999
they were scouting the

986.68 --> 990.92
land exploring

990.959 --> 997.56
woohoo so exciting right but I mean it

994.759 --> 1002.8000000000001
is in a place that doesn't exist it

997.56 --> 1002.8
never does never has never will

1003.279 --> 1010.279
couldn't but if you just fil the

1006.839 --> 1010.2790000000001
hypothetical science

1011.199 --> 1016.4399999999999
fiction

1012.92 --> 1020.399
playground into a story ground for

1016.44 --> 1024.319
people that act like people

1020.399 --> 1026.52
and live then suddenly yeah it works

1024.319 --> 1030.52
together it's like no no you could live

1026.52 --> 1030.52
there too I mean it's so

1032.039 --> 1037.24
natural right I

1034.039 --> 1039.72
mean all these space series like what

1037.24 --> 1042.439
makes them good is compelling characters

1039.72 --> 1044.3600000000001
compelling character

1042.439 --> 1049.8400000000001
development and

1044.36 --> 1053.08
just yeah good writing Etc of

1049.84 --> 1056.36
course but it's like space movies that

1053.08 --> 1059.32
have sucky characters in

1056.36 --> 1061.4799999999998
them or actors that are just not very

1059.32 --> 1063.559
appealing yeah they don't they don't

1061.48 --> 1066.32
work very well do

1063.559 --> 1067.8799999999999
they so it's really the person that kind

1066.32 --> 1071.4399999999998
of carries

1067.88 --> 1074.16
it that makes that

1071.44 --> 1076.88
work it's like oh well if enough really

1074.16 --> 1079.24
nice people just tell you like no no

1076.88 --> 1080.8400000000001
we're going there oh we're trying to

1079.24 --> 1085.6
wake break the bar

1080.84 --> 1085.6
barrier and we can go infinite

1086.0 --> 1091.039
speed and I'm hearing it I'm like oh

1088.559 --> 1093.6399999999999
that sounds a little bit barded

1091.039 --> 1097.12
there probably didn't really think that

1093.64 --> 1099.5590000000002
through too much but I'm almost like

1097.12 --> 1101.799
subc compartmentalizing the Techno bble

1099.559 --> 1104.08
on Star Trek and just making them

1101.799 --> 1107.6
treating them like now that's what they

1104.08 --> 1111.6
think it is they probably genuinely

1107.6 --> 1111.6
think that and it's kind of silly that

1111.88 --> 1119.5590000000002
they still carry their false

1116.679 --> 1120.5590000000002
ideas through mathematics and mechanics

1119.559 --> 1123.28
and

1120.559 --> 1126.32
conceptions like even within the science

1123.28 --> 1127.28
fiction Universe where most of it

1126.32 --> 1130.1589999999999
actually

1127.28 --> 1133.8799999999999
works it just can't help it but be a

1130.159 --> 1137.0800000000002
little bit delusional about

1133.88 --> 1140.72
it but I guess that's just Ballwin

1137.08 --> 1140.72
telling me that

1145.2 --> 1149.28
but yeah I am enjoying that series once

1150.919 --> 1156.0800000000002
again I we like be putting other stuff

1154.2 --> 1159.44
on hold for a bit I mean I still want to

1156.08 --> 1159.4399999999998
continue watching the

1160.919 --> 1168.3600000000001
uh is it the the the Greek god animated

1165.36 --> 1169.9599999999998
series thing cuz that first part was

1168.36 --> 1172.32
really

1169.96 --> 1176.64
impressive but yeah I'm putting that on

1172.32 --> 1176.6399999999999
hold until I'm like satisfied with this

1178.24 --> 1185.72
stuff but I mean it it's weird and it's

1182.919 --> 1187.64
in a way kind of sad that it does kind

1185.72 --> 1191.08
of just watching it it just makes it

1187.64 --> 1194.0800000000002
feel like they're they're like a

1191.08 --> 1194.08
family

1194.44 --> 1199.3200000000002
like it is in a way yeah like a family

1198.24 --> 1201.96
replace

1199.32 --> 1203.8799999999999
thing that they emulate there you do

1201.96 --> 1207.4
feel part of the family when you watch

1203.88 --> 1209.8400000000001
it and I think that that is probably the

1207.4 --> 1209.8400000000001
social

1212.6 --> 1217.1999999999998
component that makes it work and of

1215.32 --> 1220.799
course the characters being likable and

1217.2 --> 1223.6000000000001
having good developed principles Etc I

1220.799 --> 1226.44
mean like cultural

1223.6 --> 1228.9599999999998
socially like Voyager particularly is

1226.44 --> 1231.679
really welldeveloped compared to the

1228.96 --> 1233.96
others which are like decently developed

1231.679 --> 1237.1200000000001
or there's some development or a hint of

1233.96 --> 1239.559
it but I mean like it's pretty

1237.12 --> 1239.559
welldeveloped

1244.48 --> 1251.28
like in different directions like like

1248.28 --> 1256.32
they actually do have some incling of

1251.28 --> 1256.32
understanding and respect for

1256.799 --> 1263.679
beliefs like there's

1259.76 --> 1265.919
very little Prejudice in it and there's

1263.679 --> 1268.3600000000001
not even like polarized prejudice

1265.919 --> 1271.3600000000001
against people that have Prejudice that

1268.36 --> 1275.8799999999999
much like even those people do like get

1271.36 --> 1278.52
the opportunity to learn from their

1275.88 --> 1281.0800000000002
mistakes or their ways in a way it like

1278.52 --> 1281.08
it's all

1284.44 --> 1291.6000000000001
so honest and politically neutral like

1289.159 --> 1293.8400000000001
that's really that part really stands

1291.6 --> 1295.8799999999999
out to me with Star Trek Voyager is that

1293.84 --> 1299.0
it is so

1295.88 --> 1303.44
delightfully politically

real

1381.08 --> 1385.799
hey

1382.32 --> 1390.2
doons that planet sounds

1385.799 --> 1390.2
gay yeah and very bad for your

1396.84 --> 1402.48
teeth but sounds it's more like it looks

1399.88 --> 1404.0
gay just look at that photo and the link

1402.48 --> 1408.0
that clearly

1404.0 --> 1408.0
posted uh

1414.59 --> 1417.9299999999998
[Music]

1438.12 --> 1441.1589999999999
uh yeah yeah t casc by the way what you

1440.12 --> 1445.6399999999999
said

1441.159 --> 1448.6000000000001
earlier somebody abuses their

1445.64 --> 1453.0
body and becomes 100 a somebody else

1448.6 --> 1455.36
Strokes out at 18 yeah not really like

1453.0 --> 1455.36
that

1457.159 --> 1464.7990000000002
though I mean what is abuse right I mean

1462.52 --> 1468.0
have you ever like considered to take a

1464.799 --> 1471.76
step back and and actually look at what

1468.0 --> 1471.76
people call abuse of their

1472.76 --> 1479.679
body and what people Overlook as being

1476.48 --> 1479.679
actual abuse of their

1480.799 --> 1489.24
body

1483.52 --> 1490.96
right people call smoking abuse of their

1489.24 --> 1497.72
body

1490.96 --> 1497.72
but based on what on what perspective

1500.399 --> 1505.279
right I just don't have those same views

1503.2 --> 1508.159
and like what people call

1505.279 --> 1510.919
abuse I mean it could just if you just

1508.159 --> 1510.919
do the right

1511.559 --> 1516.559
things

1513.52 --> 1519.279
like just consider

1516.559 --> 1523.039
that having moral

1519.279 --> 1523.039
stability and proper

1524.159 --> 1528.3990000000001
motivation and a sense that you're

1526.24 --> 1530.48
holding on to your principles and that

1528.399 --> 1534.2399999999998
it's doing some good and all that good

1530.48 --> 1538.559
moral uplifting spirit that that is

1534.24 --> 1541.84
like practically in my view thus

1538.559 --> 1545.72
far way more

1541.84 --> 1548.36
influential than whatever chemical

1545.72 --> 1550.52
inconvenient chemicals or whatever you

1548.36 --> 1554.4399999999998
subject yourself

1550.52 --> 1557.0
to on a regular basis like pollution

1554.44 --> 1559.3990000000001
basic pollution which smoking arguably

1557.0 --> 1564.2
contains I mean it does contain these

1559.399 --> 1564.1999999999998
chemicals and so you could see it like

1582.52 --> 1589.76
that right and the idea of sickness and

1586.44 --> 1591.72
how it is a cleanup mechanism

1589.76 --> 1594.52
like what that does and like what

1591.72 --> 1596.64
happens when it's when that doesn't

1594.52 --> 1599.36
happen like the damage could be more

1596.64 --> 1600.44
substantial if you don't get sick when

1599.36 --> 1603.8799999999999
you

1600.44 --> 1605.8400000000001
should because you're like polluted

1603.88 --> 1609.159
somehow right and then there's the

1605.84 --> 1613.8799999999999
German new medicine consideration of

1609.159 --> 1613.88
the psychological emotional

1615.559 --> 1623.32
turmoil and the physical response after

1620.48 --> 1626.32
that and then if you then all put that

1623.32 --> 1630.76
all that knowledge together roughly like

1626.32 --> 1634.84
what do you get well you get a a really

1630.76 --> 1637.399
a person that's just finding a delicate

1634.84 --> 1640.1589999999999
balance between all of

1637.399 --> 1643.32
it a person that would stress themselves

1640.159 --> 1646.3600000000001
out just frantically trying to cut off

1643.32 --> 1648.36
any tox toxic influences from Habits or

1646.36 --> 1650.6399999999999
food

1648.36 --> 1654.1589999999999
but like being quite fearful and

1650.64 --> 1657.48
paranoid because of that you think that

1654.159 --> 1660.6000000000001
they have a healthier

1657.48 --> 1663.76
Constitution than somebody that's just

1660.6 --> 1665.6
like thinking about no I'm just like

1663.76 --> 1668.32
thinking about the good things in this

1665.6 --> 1672.08
food and then like amplifying that and

1668.32 --> 1673.8799999999999
just like forgiving the bad side and

1672.08 --> 1675.8799999999999
then like those people might eat

1673.88 --> 1680.1200000000001
non-organic even and

1675.88 --> 1680.1200000000001
still be fine

1680.399 --> 1686.799
right and by the way that wouldn't apply

1682.399 --> 1689.2399999999998
to me because I like I eat Strictly

1686.799 --> 1692.24
Organic and for me like eating

1689.24 --> 1692.24
nonorganic

1693.799 --> 1700.96
like the backlash from that is literally

1697.84 --> 1702.72
more baked in psychological than it is

1700.96 --> 1704.6000000000001
will be physical but there will be a

1702.72 --> 1708.919
physical response it's also because I'm

1704.6 --> 1712.32
not used to how that works

1708.919 --> 1714.64
to how yeah how non-organic food

1712.32 --> 1717.039
typically

1714.64 --> 1720.24
is so there's like the

1717.039 --> 1722.1589999999999
adjustment issue with that but also just

1720.24 --> 1725.32
the psychological barrier because it's

1722.159 --> 1728.8400000000001
such a strong decision for me and it's

1725.32 --> 1728.84
all an influence

1742.679 --> 1747.3600000000001
it's like what type of gamble do you

1745.48 --> 1749.3600000000001
really want to take with your life do

1747.36 --> 1752.7199999999998
you want to gamble with being super

1749.36 --> 1755.279
strict and having tension because of the

1752.72 --> 1758.84
discipline or do you want to gamble with

1755.279 --> 1763.36
being super relaxed super loose

1758.84 --> 1767.039
but more Wild on the

1763.36 --> 1770.0
influx which could then more randomly

1767.039 --> 1772.12
lead to you making a foolish decision

1770.0 --> 1775.919
that your body simply can't

1772.12 --> 1780.1589999999999
handle right which one do you choose I

1775.919 --> 1780.159
much more of the disciplined

1781.159 --> 1785.679
side and having those issues

1787.12 --> 1793.799
too like if you're really strict on your

1790.159 --> 1799.3200000000002
health and you're very have a lot of

1793.799 --> 1804.279
attention spent on that then

1799.32 --> 1804.279
the problems will come forth from the

1807.08 --> 1811.9189999999999
tension right in contrast the person

1809.919 --> 1814.3990000000001
that absolutely doesn't do that is just

1811.919 --> 1817.279
like no I'll just eat

1814.399 --> 1821.36
whatever well they'll just not have

1817.279 --> 1824.679
tension like that just go about and then

1821.36 --> 1826.6789999999999
they'll have like unforeseen unexpected

1824.679 --> 1829.76
backlash

1826.679 --> 1833.159
from the not so great food quality that

1829.76 --> 1833.1589999999999
they might consume

1833.36 --> 1839.84
sometimes so they'll have like more

1836.519 --> 1842.84
physical toxic backlash on

1839.84 --> 1845.1589999999999
average right so they'll have the food

1842.84 --> 1847.72
based toxic

1845.159 --> 1849.6000000000001
backlash and the person that's really

1847.72 --> 1851.88
strict on it will have more of this

1849.6 --> 1855.12
psychological

1851.88 --> 1859.3200000000002
strain influence

1855.12 --> 1863.559
backlash so it's really choice of like

1859.32 --> 1863.559
which works best for

1864.6 --> 1870.799
you because it's not like oh no it's

1867.84 --> 1875.1999999999998
definitely that one way and everybody

1870.799 --> 1875.2
should do it that one way no no no cuz

1876.32 --> 1883.24
it's if you're just a person that like

1879.159 --> 1888.3600000000001
naturally is not very good at focusing

1883.24 --> 1889.72
or keeping track of things than having a

1888.36 --> 1893.0
like a

1889.72 --> 1894.72
strict diet lifestyle is just a

1893.0 --> 1897.36
nightmare to those

1894.72 --> 1899.72
people they'll have Psy psychological

1897.36 --> 1902.399
strain just from trying

1899.72 --> 1905.679
that they'll naturally feel miserable

1902.399 --> 1910.1589999999999
but if you're like a very organized

1905.679 --> 1913.799
conscious reflecting type of mind then

1910.159 --> 1917.679
living like that is actually stimulating

1913.799 --> 1917.679
and give you structure

1920.559 --> 1927.72
which in a way relieves some of the

1924.08 --> 1927.72
excess tension that could build

1929.24 --> 1937.32
up right so it's all about the balance

1934.2 --> 1940.3990000000001
between psychological strain and tension

1937.32 --> 1946.1589999999999
over how you're doing things and what

1940.399 --> 1948.76
you're worrying about versus the toxic

1946.159 --> 1950.6390000000001
influence of

1948.76 --> 1953.6
food additives

1950.639 --> 1956.1999999999998
Etc God forbid medical experimentation I

1953.6 --> 1961.1999999999998
mean this really

1956.2 --> 1964.2
matters for every person to consider

1961.2 --> 1964.2
that

1965.399 --> 1971.08
what what the [ __ ] duper why the hell

1968.159 --> 1975.44
are you bringing what the

1971.08 --> 1978.4399999999998
[ __ ] cow is used for what's gross about

1975.44 --> 1978.44
that

1993.6 --> 1996.24
I I don't get

1996.48 --> 2003.08
it it's po well it's fermented for

2000.36 --> 2005.039
starters and it's extremely nutritious

2003.08 --> 2009.76
to

2005.039 --> 2009.76
plants I I don't see why that's gross

2012.679 --> 2021.279
it's very strange duper I mean you do

2015.919 --> 2021.279
know how like basic agriculture works

2026.919 --> 2033.2
right to me it's gross okay well I guess

2030.36 --> 2035.6789999999999
you're not a big agricultural natural

2033.2 --> 2039.2
Talent

2035.679 --> 2042.5590000000002
then cuz it isn't gross I mean it's

2039.2 --> 2042.559
fermented it's very

2056.359 --> 2063.639
different I mean it's stimulating to

2059.119 --> 2066.76
plants through the root system Etc it's

2063.639 --> 2068.2400000000002
like like steroids for plants that just

2066.76 --> 2072.3990000000003
beefs them up

2068.24 --> 2075.4799999999996
that's good right of course most

2072.399 --> 2078.3199999999997
important factors usually are like the

2075.48 --> 2081.32
minerals and all

2078.32 --> 2085.3590000000004
that and hey even people can eat those

2081.32 --> 2089.76
components like you can

2085.359 --> 2091.7999999999997
eat like plants that are like grow Clay

2089.76 --> 2096.3590000000004
and they're going to be very mineral

2091.8 --> 2097.92
rich or you can literally just eat the

2096.359 --> 2099.88
clay

2097.92 --> 2104.119
just scoop it

2099.88 --> 2104.119
up don't bite too hard on

2105.04 --> 2110.96
it like that's actually can be healthy

2108.839 --> 2116.0789999999997
depending on the type of clay I

2110.96 --> 2116.079
mean natural like River

2116.4 --> 2123.64
clay like don't use

2119.72 --> 2126.7599999999998
a like oil

2123.64 --> 2128.56
based clay that that's not that's

2126.76 --> 2133.88
definitely unhealthy

2128.56 --> 2133.88
what's fermented bro duper you are

2134.0 --> 2141.24
like have you ever planted a

2138.52 --> 2144.28
plant have your parents ever made you

2141.24 --> 2146.2
like work in a garden or

2144.28 --> 2148.8390000000004
something I mean you don't even know

2146.2 --> 2151.839
what ferment it is

2148.839 --> 2155.16
really well first off you could Google

2151.839 --> 2158.2
that right but fermented is

2155.16 --> 2160.7999999999997
basically having fungi and back

2158.2 --> 2162.68
bacteria that are out there in nature

2160.8 --> 2166.079
transform

2162.68 --> 2168.839
it and the the fermentation process

2166.079 --> 2171.7200000000003
typically

2168.839 --> 2174.44
universally makes

2171.72 --> 2177.24
nutrients and minerals and components

2174.44 --> 2178.48
more available bioavailable is what they

2177.24 --> 2182.4799999999996
call

2178.48 --> 2187.839
it so the fermentation process just

2182.48 --> 2191.16
causes the manure to suddenly be very us

2187.839 --> 2193.599
and absorbable by the plant roots

2191.16 --> 2196.52
because if you just poo direct like just

2193.599 --> 2200.3590000000004
AER directly on plants or plant roots

2196.52 --> 2203.079
that's not good has like

2200.359 --> 2206.359
just yeah it can even like

2203.079 --> 2207.4
disease can disease a plant make it rot

2206.359 --> 2211.839
or

2207.4 --> 2214.4
something isn't fungus bad no no fungus

2211.839 --> 2218.359
is essential

2214.4 --> 2221.079
duper did you not know that like Forest

2218.359 --> 2223.359
ground have like tons of different types

2221.079 --> 2227.48
of fungi in them that's why mushrooms

2223.359 --> 2232.119
can grow there right without the fungus

2227.48 --> 2236.16
it would all die all of it all the

2232.119 --> 2241.599
plants they need it the fungi literally

2236.16 --> 2241.5989999999997
help transform the ground all the

2244.92 --> 2250.8
time if food has fungus in it it means

2248.44 --> 2253.839
it's spoiled well it just means that

2250.8 --> 2257.3590000000004
it's already like like fungi basically

2253.839 --> 2261.96
just digest the food and transform it

2257.359 --> 2265.2
and there is fermented food and you know

2261.96 --> 2267.44
what fermented food actually is

2265.2 --> 2270.4399999999996
incredibly

2267.44 --> 2274.319
healthy the idea of it is gross it might

2270.44 --> 2277.079
even like smell or taste like not super

2274.319 --> 2279.48
great but it actually tends to be

2277.079 --> 2281.44
extreme healthy and there's the whole

2279.48 --> 2285.96
traditions of

2281.44 --> 2285.96
fermenting certain types of

2286.16 --> 2291.2
foods

2288.44 --> 2293.8
herbs that you then eat in the fermented

2291.2 --> 2298.68
State and that actually is great oh oh

2293.8 --> 2303.2000000000003
and you might know one of the oldtime

2298.68 --> 2308.48
fermented food Classics it's called

2303.2 --> 2312.56
cheese yeah what is cheese ferment

2308.48 --> 2312.56
milk that's literally what it

2319.8 --> 2327.319
is

2322.0 --> 2330.64
yeah it's so typical so classic that

2327.319 --> 2332.8
like arguably even medieval people oh

2330.64 --> 2335.7999999999997
those barbarians what yeah I don't think

2332.8 --> 2338.079
that's it was really like that even they

2335.8 --> 2340.599
know know about it

2338.079 --> 2343.6400000000003
just like fungus you

2340.599 --> 2345.44
use some fungus can be toxic and other

2343.64 --> 2347.7999999999997
fungus

2345.44 --> 2353.44
actually

2347.8 --> 2353.44
transforms nutrients into becoming more

2356.88 --> 2362.7200000000003
absorbable right but yeah if you leave

2359.079 --> 2365.4
certain types of food out then

2362.72 --> 2368.1189999999997
eventually it yeah fungus can take hold

2365.4 --> 2369.7200000000003
of it and just start eating away at it

2368.119 --> 2374.2000000000003
and that's called spoiled and those

2369.72 --> 2377.2799999999997
types of fungus like you shouldn't eat

2374.2 --> 2380.2
that like those are basically the the

2377.28 --> 2382.44
Hostile type of fungi usually the not so

2380.2 --> 2382.4399999999996
good

2390.24 --> 2399.319
ones right but I mean as I said fungi

2394.119 --> 2399.319
come in in a wide range of types

2401.0 --> 2405.599
and plenty of them are actually not that

2403.2 --> 2405.5989999999997
bad at

2409.119 --> 2416.04
all so yeah maybe that'll give you a new

2413.8 --> 2418.28
look on things

2416.04 --> 2421.68
duper kind of surprised you didn't know

2418.28 --> 2424.76
about that then again you are very

2421.68 --> 2426.2
young right anyway I'm going to take a

2424.76 --> 2430.4
bite out of this before it becomes

2426.2 --> 2430.3999999999996
completely cold cheers is

2477.0 --> 2483.119
H okay Moxy you're going to stop smoking

2479.96 --> 2483.119
tomorrow good

2483.76 --> 2488.4
luck yeah I'm not there

2492.68 --> 2498.839
in fact I really hope to

2494.839 --> 2498.839
get PayPal donation

2499.319 --> 2506.079
today

2501.96 --> 2506.079
cuz I'm

2506.48 --> 2512.4
yeah I'm like through my tobacco I'd

2510.2 --> 2514.52
really like a fresh packet otherwise I'd

2512.4 --> 2519.119
have to like recycle and

2514.52 --> 2521.48
[ __ ] like the old stuff and that's

2519.119 --> 2525.2400000000002
sucks I mean it's better than nothing

2521.48 --> 2525.2400000000002
but not exactly

2531.68 --> 2536.8799999999997
Pleasant so please donate to my PayPal

2534.4 --> 2536.88
that would be

2540.44 --> 2545.16
great and don't forget the Rogan's up

2542.839 --> 2547.88
the show of

2545.16 --> 2550.8799999999997
course hits what are you talking about

2547.88 --> 2550.88
Jason

2593.599 --> 2598.6800000000003
right yeah sure Jason I mean don't

2596.48 --> 2601.72
really need to hear

2598.68 --> 2603.839
about drug desperation habits that's

2601.72 --> 2607.0789999999997
great I know everything about how that

2603.839 --> 2609.599
works scraping a bowls a bong that's

2607.079 --> 2613.04
it's really [ __ ]

2609.599 --> 2613.04
gross but

2613.48 --> 2619.4
uh I usually

2616.0 --> 2619.4
scrape like the

2625.4 --> 2628.839
grinder but

2632.76 --> 2638.3190000000004
uh yeah I don't smoke much these days

2635.48 --> 2643.52
anyway

2638.319 --> 2643.52
dosages are low and that saves a lot of

2645.0 --> 2650.64
cost the tobacco though is getting like

2647.8 --> 2653.1600000000003
outrageously

2650.64 --> 2654.92
expensive it hasn't switched yet to the

2653.16 --> 2658.92
new price but I mean that's pretty

2654.92 --> 2658.92
messed up how expensive it's

2660.68 --> 2668.0789999999997
getting roach

2663.24 --> 2670.3999999999996
CH wow that is that is incredibly that's

2668.079 --> 2673.579
Jason I'm not that

2670.4 --> 2673.579
[Music]

2678.98 --> 2682.119
[Music]

2683.599 --> 2688.839
desperate I

2685.559 --> 2690.2000000000003
mean I'm like that with tobacco but it's

2688.839 --> 2692.44
just

2690.2 --> 2695.72
like eventually the

2692.44 --> 2699.0
tobacco in pouches like it kind of

2695.72 --> 2700.359
becomes dust

2699.0 --> 2703.839
and like

2700.359 --> 2706.5589999999997
not not structured

2703.839 --> 2708.7999999999997
anymore and yeah that sucks that part

2706.559 --> 2712.599
you don't like go to the

2708.8 --> 2715.319
last little bit of

2712.599 --> 2719.0
dust because it sucks that last part but

2715.319 --> 2719.0
I do tend to save it

2721.319 --> 2728.48
up for more desperate times I mean why

2724.4 --> 2730.1600000000003
not just basically have a pouch full of

2728.48 --> 2733.28
just

2730.16 --> 2735.44
dust of like the lower quality Remnant

2733.28 --> 2739.1600000000003
type stuff but I mean it it stays just

2735.44 --> 2741.599
fine for an extremely long time like

2739.16 --> 2743.5589999999997
it's not really going to dry up anymore

2741.599 --> 2745.7200000000003
than it did

2743.559 --> 2748.2400000000002
already right so that's kind of an

2745.72 --> 2748.24
efficient

2749.16 --> 2754.48
way to have emergency tobacco

2757.48 --> 2764.96
but with cannabis not so

2760.24 --> 2764.9599999999996
much all right anyway

2814.04 --> 2818.839
man Illuminati catons are just

2841.99 --> 2845.14
[Music]

2845.839 --> 2849.88
great for

2895.319 --> 2899.2
all right so yeah Jason now that you're

2901.04 --> 2905.68
here any new developments

2907.24 --> 2912.839
any new progress in

2909.44 --> 2916.8
your there I even draw it in in the

2912.839 --> 2916.7999999999997
picture again with your concave

2917.48 --> 2922.2400000000002
beliefs or is it still just a thing that

2920.2 --> 2925.5989999999997
you

2922.24 --> 2929.52
just believe per default and it's like

2925.599 --> 2929.52
not changing at all

2938.76 --> 2946.119
or have you given up on the concave

2941.559 --> 2946.119
nonsense yeah and it is no

2957.52 --> 2962.68
curvature ask Lord Steven Christ wasn't

2961.079 --> 2967.96
he still in

2962.68 --> 2967.96
jail why the hell would I ask that guy

2975.28 --> 2981.599
I never even like heard a satisfactory

2977.799 --> 2983.24
explanation about how the celestials are

2981.599 --> 2986.28
supposed to be

2983.24 --> 2989.9199999999996
working on the inside of

2986.28 --> 2995.3190000000004
the the concave ball

2989.92 --> 2995.319
Earth he died in jail oh [ __ ]

2996.839 --> 3002.2
okay well then in that case his spirit

2999.599 --> 3005.96
is still dwelling in that jail damn I

3002.2 --> 3005.96
didn't know he died the

3017.92 --> 3023.559
[Music]

3020.44 --> 3028.52
[ __ ] the celestial

3023.559 --> 3030.4
spheres sphere is what spins

3028.52 --> 3034.04
yeah but how is that supposed to be

3030.4 --> 3037.119
seemingly enveloping us when we're on

3034.04 --> 3037.119
the inside of a

3041.28 --> 3047.44
ball herose again after 3

3044.319 --> 3050.119
days okay

3047.44 --> 3052.799
clear take it easy there you are talking

3050.119 --> 3056.7200000000003
about a real world person that actually

3052.799 --> 3056.72
died is not really

3056.96 --> 3063.88
something you should be joking

3060.359 --> 3063.88
about to be

3080.0 --> 3085.64
fair this so yeah yeah absolutely

3087.13 --> 3090.3
[Music]

3096.68 --> 3101.8799999999997
okay Jason yeah I

3098.76 --> 3104.88
don't thanks for the uh the update I

3101.88 --> 3108.34
don't need any uh more information about

3104.88 --> 3111.57
that I I got an idea

3108.34 --> 3111.57
[Music]

3119.799 --> 3123.44
right so yeah no solution

3125.4 --> 3130.88
then how is a celestial sphere supposed

3128.44 --> 3133.559
to surround you when you're on the

3130.88 --> 3133.559
inside of a

3137.4 --> 3142.76
ball unless you're going for my

3140.119 --> 3144.1600000000003
conception of the non-local holographic

3142.76 --> 3147.5200000000004
angular

3144.16 --> 3150.96
manifestations cuz hey nonlocal

3147.52 --> 3153.319
angular manifestations can just

3150.96 --> 3157.079
technically work in

3153.319 --> 3157.079
anything and I mean

3159.319 --> 3168.839
anything like it can even work on a

3163.2 --> 3168.839
globe in a globe on a flat Earth of any

3169.119 --> 3176.2000000000003
size that's the kind

3171.319 --> 3176.2
of funny thing about it

3177.319 --> 3183.0
right because the one thing that does is

3180.319 --> 3184.359
take away any physically assumption bias

3183.0 --> 3187.799
you might

3184.359 --> 3190.48
have with which you would

3187.799 --> 3194.559
relate what you see out there of the

3190.48 --> 3197.599
celestials with how you regard the Earth

3194.559 --> 3201.4
like the heliocentric ball Earth

3197.599 --> 3201.4
cosmology specifically

3202.119 --> 3207.6400000000003
does right once as soon as you think of

3205.559 --> 3209.3590000000004
the celestial say nonlocal holographic

3207.64 --> 3211.1189999999997
angular

3209.359 --> 3214.16
manifestations then

3211.119 --> 3218.359
suddenly it is truly cut

3214.16 --> 3221.799
off from having any ties to what the

3218.359 --> 3221.799
Earth you're standing on is

3229.48 --> 3237.52
like the celestial sphere is in the

3233.079 --> 3239.96
middle of the inside of the sphere Earth

3237.52 --> 3243.319
okay yeah but Jason if that were the

3239.96 --> 3247.4
case then why wouldn't we at all times

3243.319 --> 3247.4
see a celestial

3247.68 --> 3255.3999999999996
sphere like above us not enveloping us

3252.16 --> 3258.7599999999998
like over us like an apparent Dome of

3255.4 --> 3261.92
Lights why wouldn't we then look against

3258.76 --> 3263.76
a sphere that's hanging above us you see

3261.92 --> 3267.28
it it seems like you didn't really think

3263.76 --> 3271.559
about it that much like all cers don't

3267.28 --> 3271.559
really think much about their

3273.599 --> 3278.48
conclusions that's why I

3275.76 --> 3282.2000000000003
asked how can the celestial

3278.48 --> 3286.0
sphere that we see with our

3282.2 --> 3288.5589999999997
eyes cover us envelop

3286.0 --> 3290.68
us while it's supposed to be on the

3288.559 --> 3291.92
inside of a sphere you're standing on

3290.68 --> 3295.799
the inside

3291.92 --> 3297.319
of wouldn't you then see a celestial

3295.799 --> 3299.599
sphere

3297.319 --> 3302.5589999999997
above you like a ball of stars and

3299.599 --> 3306.319
lights that's just above you well we

3302.559 --> 3308.48
don't see that we see it not go this we

3306.319 --> 3312.599
see it go

3308.48 --> 3314.04
this to our Horizon so how does that

3312.599 --> 3317.48
work

3314.04 --> 3317.48
then that's my

3318.799 --> 3327.079
question I mean you concers have had

3322.28 --> 3327.079
over a decade to think about this

3346.48 --> 3352.2
or is it not really about technical

3349.119 --> 3355.2000000000003
logic is it more about holding on to the

3352.2 --> 3355.2
faith

3357.4 --> 3361.76
it doesn't have to make sense you just

3359.119 --> 3361.76
have to believe

3362.76 --> 3369.3190000000004
it cuz that's been my

3366.44 --> 3371.88
impression in all this time that I have

3369.319 --> 3376.119
from concav it's part of the reason why

3371.88 --> 3380.039
I found it so obnoxious and that's why I

3376.119 --> 3380.039
kept kicking you out

3380.839 --> 3387.2
earlier which I don't think that's

3382.799 --> 3391.0
necessary anymore but I I

3387.2 --> 3393.799
I take cosmology very serious and it's

3391.0 --> 3396.4
like I just like to see it more

3393.799 --> 3398.88
developed what from whatever vantage

3396.4 --> 3400.76
point I mean just look at what I've

3398.88 --> 3404.319
built

3400.76 --> 3406.7200000000003
right how could the Earth be all these

3404.319 --> 3408.52
unknown factors and then just filling in

3406.72 --> 3411.3999999999996
all the unknown factors like I've done

3408.52 --> 3413.64
that I don't understand why other people

3411.4 --> 3417.0
and their specific cosmology believes

3413.64 --> 3420.24
why they don't do that why aren't you

3417.0 --> 3425.359
doing that why aren't you tinkering the

3420.24 --> 3425.359
details getting it more logically

3431.799 --> 3437.72
functional i' look at all the the

3435.48 --> 3440.319
brilliant from a science fiction

3437.72 --> 3442.4399999999996
perspective alone brilliant and I'm very

3440.319 --> 3445.5589999999997
impressed by them Concepts that I've put

3442.44 --> 3447.68
forth like the non-local holographic

3445.559 --> 3450.76
angular man

3447.68 --> 3452.7599999999998
but also conceptions like non-space like

3450.76 --> 3456.44
I'm very proud of that

3452.76 --> 3460.8390000000004
non-space like that's not out

3456.44 --> 3467.039
there yeah science fiction is not filled

3460.839 --> 3468.7599999999998
with oh the non space no no no it is not

3467.039 --> 3471.2000000000003
but it is definitely something to

3468.76 --> 3476.4
consider like my conception of

3471.2 --> 3479.5589999999997
non-space in a way comes in its when you

3476.4 --> 3483.0
compare the forms of it comes almost

3479.559 --> 3483.0
close to something like dark

3483.28 --> 3489.2400000000002
matter except dark matter is just

3486.839 --> 3493.24
compensation for mathematical

3489.24 --> 3495.9199999999996
incompetence basically of the entire

3493.24 --> 3498.7599999999998
system well the non-space is just like

3495.92 --> 3498.76
The Logical

3500.72 --> 3508.0389999999998
Remnant like what exists and then

3504.319 --> 3512.16
outside of what exists nons space

3508.039 --> 3514.4
there's nothing there is no volume for

3512.16 --> 3519.0389999999998
matter to exist

3514.4 --> 3519.039
in and it might be rigidly

3526.2 --> 3533.68
placed very happy

3528.44 --> 3533.68
about G giving it a name as well

3541.88 --> 3546.88
now of course I'm also kind of proud

3544.48 --> 3550.0
about just like looping

3546.88 --> 3552.76
Dynamics like being fluid about spal

3550.0 --> 3556.4
Dynamics like yeah oh you have a map

3552.76 --> 3559.76
it's all linear but in this location

3556.4 --> 3562.7200000000003
yeah you might just end up traveling to

3559.76 --> 3565.3590000000004
that point a lot

3562.72 --> 3567.4399999999996
farther from anywhere there like it's

3565.359 --> 3569.799
almost like your traveling inside of a

3567.44 --> 3572.28
tunnel there might be an island

3569.799 --> 3574.48
somewhere like in a tunnel and the

3572.28 --> 3578.4
distance you have to go to actually

3574.48 --> 3582.28
reach it is like illogically far well

3578.4 --> 3585.44
that would also be like special

3582.28 --> 3588.559
nonlinearity you have the map you have a

3585.44 --> 3590.799
island registered there but then you

3588.559 --> 3593.3190000000004
want to get there and it just takes way

3590.799 --> 3595.48
longer from any distance way longer to

3593.319 --> 3596.68
actually get there and to get back

3595.48 --> 3599.72
anywhere else

3596.68 --> 3602.64
else even though like yeah if you move

3599.72 --> 3604.799
around it it's not that far right well

3602.64 --> 3607.16
that would be a sign of spal

3604.799 --> 3608.64
nonlinearity like there's a tunnel there

3607.16 --> 3612.2
and it just

3608.64 --> 3613.48
takes a further horizontal distance to

3612.2 --> 3616.3999999999996
get to that

3613.48 --> 3618.92
point even though when you go around it

3616.4 --> 3623.0
it wouldn't take that long to go around

3618.92 --> 3625.16
it right that's sign of spatial

3623.0 --> 3626.52
nonlinearity right and that may be the

3625.16 --> 3630.48
case on Earth

3626.52 --> 3634.119
entirely especially in the northern

3630.48 --> 3635.4
part that if you think of the Earth as a

3634.119 --> 3638.0
this

3635.4 --> 3639.96
projection that the north simply

3638.0 --> 3643.079
contains more

3639.96 --> 3646.88
volume than should logically

3643.079 --> 3650.6800000000003
fit inside of the disc and that

3646.88 --> 3653.119
potentially this the outer ring right

3650.68 --> 3657.0389999999998
this the southern hemisphere as the

3653.119 --> 3662.079
globers would call it that it

3657.039 --> 3664.079
is not long enough to able to be

3662.079 --> 3668.3590000000004
logically

3664.079 --> 3668.3590000000004
fitting on the outside of a

3669.319 --> 3675.4
disc like these are suspicions I've had

3672.839 --> 3680.0789999999997
that I've not been able to

3675.4 --> 3684.079
confirm too much but not

3680.079 --> 3684.079
like dispel them

3684.76 --> 3689.079
either and and so you get what do you

3687.52 --> 3692.44
end up

3689.079 --> 3693.599
with well realization that yeah the

3692.44 --> 3697.359
Earth is

3693.599 --> 3698.559
flat the geometry of the earth's surface

3697.359 --> 3703.2799999999997
is all

3698.559 --> 3705.52
parallel but that it's not all exactly

3703.28 --> 3705.52
as

3709.0 --> 3715.2
is right it's all

3711.88 --> 3718.119
horizontal but one distance in this

3715.2 --> 3722.0
location to towards that other place

3718.119 --> 3724.44
might be different from a distance to

3722.0 --> 3724.44
another

3724.64 --> 3729.96
location even though when you then try

3727.0 --> 3733.119
to put it all together like exactly to

3729.96 --> 3736.52
scale then you end up just not being

3733.119 --> 3738.88
able to fit it like it yet it overshot

3736.52 --> 3739.88
the distance like I can't make it fit

3738.88 --> 3742.6800000000003
like a

3739.88 --> 3745.319
puzzle even from like when you put it

3742.68 --> 3747.16
together flat it can't fit how is that

3745.319 --> 3750.68
possible

3747.16 --> 3753.64
even though it's all geometrically

3750.68 --> 3757.44
flat how could you not make this the

3753.64 --> 3757.44
surface of Earth

3757.48 --> 3763.52
fit well the only reason I could find

3760.48 --> 3765.16
for that to not be possible is if space

3763.52 --> 3767.7599999999998
was not entirely

3765.16 --> 3769.1189999999997
linear I I used to talk about that at

3767.76 --> 3771.079
the

3769.119 --> 3772.88
beginning like during the Flat Earth

3771.079 --> 3776.119
talks days one of my

3772.88 --> 3777.319
first approaches to the to the Flat

3776.119 --> 3780.2000000000003
Earth

3777.319 --> 3783.279
scene not like even

3780.2 --> 3785.2
pre-loop just realize like yeah what if

3783.279 --> 3787.72
it's just not

3785.2 --> 3791.279
linear we assume that everything is

3787.72 --> 3791.279
linear that everything is as

3791.4 --> 3797.0
linear as this plate just have this

3794.64 --> 3800.0389999999998
plate and you have this distance and

3797.0 --> 3802.68
this distance here is the same as this

3800.039 --> 3804.279
distance there it's exactly the same

3802.68 --> 3808.359
distance

3804.279 --> 3814.48
right but what if on the earth this

3808.359 --> 3814.48
distance here would be that distance

3814.839 --> 3818.4
there see the

3822.0 --> 3829.68
problem it's all flat it's all parallel

3826.24 --> 3831.8799999999997
it is all flat but how could a distance

3829.68 --> 3837.72
in one part of the

3831.88 --> 3837.7200000000003
hole be different in another part

3838.4 --> 3844.92
spatial nonlinearity and it's very

3842.24 --> 3846.64
confusing and counterintuitive too I

3844.92 --> 3850.6800000000003
mean

3846.64 --> 3853.0789999999997
this it plays directly

3850.68 --> 3856.2
against the most classic form of

3853.079 --> 3858.599
physicality assumption bias it's

3856.2 --> 3862.68
like it's not even physicality

3858.599 --> 3866.319
assumption bias it's physical linearity

3862.68 --> 3866.319
assumption bias

3867.16 --> 3871.48
the Assumption or spal linearity

3869.24 --> 3874.24
assumption bias but I mean to even call

3871.48 --> 3874.2400000000002
it that it's kind of

3876.37 --> 3883.409
[Music]

3880.23 --> 3883.409
[Applause]

3884.52 --> 3889.799
weird think I'm going to put that in the

3886.799 --> 3889.799
title

3914.4 --> 3918.839
saying the Earth is flat is essentially

3916.2 --> 3921.1189999999997
saying that a horizontal Baseline exists

3918.839 --> 3921.119
as a

3924.2 --> 3931.319
foundation I I

3927.24 --> 3935.319
guess but it's but what it mostly is is

3931.319 --> 3937.119
a geometric Constitution it's a

3935.319 --> 3940.24
geometric

3937.119 --> 3944.119
foundation so a geometric aspect about

3940.24 --> 3946.0
the whole that comes absolute yeah the

3944.119 --> 3948.799
geometric orientation of the earth's

3946.0 --> 3951.4
surface is flat that means that every

3948.799 --> 3953.64
part of the earth the geometric

3951.4 --> 3956.799
orientation of it is

3953.64 --> 3960.799
exactly parallel to every

3956.799 --> 3962.319
other geometric orientation average of

3960.799 --> 3964.72
the Earth

3962.319 --> 3967.96
surface and that doesn't say anything

3964.72 --> 3971.0789999999997
about how space is

3967.96 --> 3975.68
or what the distances are or anything it

3971.079 --> 3975.6800000000003
just says it about like no it's all

3980.799 --> 3986.52
parallel what are you doing duper no

3983.039 --> 3986.5200000000004
it's not snap

3989.76 --> 3996.3190000000004
what no it's not

3993.319 --> 3996.319
snap

3996.64 --> 4002.24
slab where the hell are you getting the

3998.68 --> 4002.24
end from duper

4033.279 --> 4037.24
okay bux that's no I'm not going to ban

4035.0 --> 4039.16
you for it it's just something that I

4037.24 --> 4044.72
don't give a [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ]

4039.16 --> 4044.72
about what you think this nonsense

4053.839 --> 4057.52
yeah you know what I am going to ban you

4055.44 --> 4059.0
for it [ __ ] off what the hell are you

4057.52 --> 4064.0
doing here with your

4059.0 --> 4064.0
[ __ ] yeah go and whine to his

4064.44 --> 4069.2400000000002
videos oh he gets it wrong I don't give

4067.279 --> 4072.119
a

4069.24 --> 4076.4399999999996
[ __ ] I'm not even talking about that hor

4072.119 --> 4078.76
[ __ ] yeah Earth is flat it's not a bat

4076.44 --> 4081.88
I don't care how you think things are

4078.76 --> 4084.8390000000004
supposed to be working on it it's not a

4081.88 --> 4084.839
ball

4085.96 --> 4092.64
dumbass I don't care if your math

4089.44 --> 4096.079
seemingly works out on a ball don't give

4092.64 --> 4096.079
a [ __ ]

4128.48 --> 4135.599999999999
yeah math our math works oh yeah sure

4132.199 --> 4139.159
it's like terrestrial refraction math

4135.6 --> 4144.319
right no no I don't

4139.159 --> 4148.839
care I don't care that you think you're

4144.319 --> 4151.759
succeeding or winning by pretending like

4148.839 --> 4154.96
some stupid math

4151.759 --> 4157.88
formula prove the Earth is a ball it's

4154.96 --> 4157.88
not a ball it's

4158.239 --> 4165.4
flat and not a ball there's no curvature

4161.88 --> 4165.400000000001
it's not a ball

4169.279 --> 4172.040000000001
yeah Celestial navigation doesn't work

4171.12 --> 4175.88
on a

4172.04 --> 4178.12
ball you don't use an arbitrary line to

4175.88 --> 4181.400000000001
the middle of the sky with celestian

4178.12 --> 4181.4
navigation you use the

4181.759 --> 4187.319
Horizon and then angle to it to a flat

4189.759 --> 4195.52
Baseline definitely looks flat to you oh

4192.759 --> 4197.239
well that's

4195.52 --> 4201.320000000001
that I guess you could call that

4197.239 --> 4201.32
progress Jason glad to hear

4201.8 --> 4204.8
it

4208.0 --> 4213.32
although i' I'd love to see a better

4211.0 --> 4216.239
developed

4213.32 --> 4218.239
concave cosmology system I mean you

4216.239 --> 4221.08
could do

4218.239 --> 4223.4
that but I'm not going to play concave

4221.08 --> 4226.679
win for you just because I know I could

4223.4 --> 4226.679
do that

4241.64 --> 4244.92
panity right

4251.199 --> 4256.96
clear but it is very typical clearly

4253.92 --> 4259.76
like through the priesthood of

4256.96 --> 4262.28
Christianity that yeah you have to

4259.76 --> 4264.4800000000005
believe even if you can't make sense of

4262.28 --> 4268.04
it you have to believe okay well if you

4264.48 --> 4270.159
have to believe then you could have to

4268.04 --> 4272.12
believe it's a globe too you know

4270.159 --> 4275.759999999999
without any evidence that fits right

4272.12 --> 4278.4
alongside it oh you believe in that you

4275.76 --> 4280.92
have to Chance some nonsensical things

4278.4 --> 4282.5199999999995
that are logically self-contradicting

4280.92 --> 4285.32
and you have to believe it or everything

4282.52 --> 4287.92
goes wrong well then why not believe

4285.32 --> 4290.88
believe in a nonsensical ball that

4287.92 --> 4293.12
contradicts all physics and law of

4290.88 --> 4294.36
Nature and all that right why not do

4293.12 --> 4298.12
that

4294.36 --> 4301.719
then yeah that's how you know the ball

4298.12 --> 4303.719
earth like was always an invention by

4301.719 --> 4306.719
the Catholic

4303.719 --> 4309.639
Church the Catholic Church who took the

4306.719 --> 4314.12
real wisdom out of

4309.639 --> 4315.719
Christianity and replaced it with faith

4314.12 --> 4317.719
faith in something that they don't even

4315.719 --> 4320.2390000000005
claim is literally real

4317.719 --> 4322.44
anymore so if you have to have faith

4320.239 --> 4325.718999999999
then why not have faith in the ball that

4322.44 --> 4328.719
you can disprove is a

4325.719 --> 4328.719
ball

4331.12 --> 4337.12
right I mean if you believe in one

4334.12 --> 4342.5599999999995
self-contradicting nonsensical claim

4337.12 --> 4342.5599999999995
then why not believe in another easily

4343.52 --> 4349.56
disprovable physical nature

4345.56 --> 4349.56
contradicting claim you

4358.88 --> 4363.679
know cuz as soon as you're going to be

4362.0 --> 4366.679
confronted with any kind of faith that

4363.679 --> 4367.84
tells you you have to believe even if it

4366.679 --> 4370.84
makes no

4367.84 --> 4370.84
sense

4371.36 --> 4377.599999999999
really because I could address what

4374.8 --> 4380.2390000000005
that's probably about in a way better

4377.6 --> 4382.719
way cuz I never say you have to believe

4380.239 --> 4387.239
in something you can't make sense of

4382.719 --> 4390.96
it's just that you could go with a

4387.239 --> 4396.12
feeling if your cognition hasn't been

4390.96 --> 4399.08
able to catch up on it yet you can trust

4396.12 --> 4401.8
your intuition to a certain degree when

4399.08 --> 4405.639
your cognition isn't ready yet to

4401.8 --> 4408.52
basically oversee how it all works l

4405.639 --> 4411.0
ically yeah that's but that's different

4408.52 --> 4412.84
then you're going by Trust on your

4411.0 --> 4414.96
intuition you're going to go by trust

4412.84 --> 4417.0
that you're going to figure it out which

4414.96 --> 4417.76
you usually then do or figure out you

4417.0 --> 4421.239
were

4417.76 --> 4424.08
wrong right but that's different in as

4421.239 --> 4428.08
in like trusting on

4424.08 --> 4430.199
something that makes no sense but you're

4428.08 --> 4433.8
going to trust on it because you feel

4430.199 --> 4433.799999999999
you have to

4435.719 --> 4439.56
how is that going to lead to anything

4441.36 --> 4444.36
good

4447.719 --> 4456.88
right why not if it's all about faith

4451.679 --> 4460.12
then why would you allow illogical

4456.88 --> 4462.12
reasoning to have to be accepted in

4460.12 --> 4467.239
order

4462.12 --> 4470.5199999999995
to keep the buzz going keep the the flow

4467.239 --> 4470.5199999999995
going of

4471.639 --> 4477.400000000001
non-cognitive things right why not cut

4475.719 --> 4481.56
it off

4477.4 --> 4483.799999999999
then like why would there that just is

4481.56 --> 4486.719
no good reason

4483.8 --> 4489.4400000000005
ever to have to believe something that

4486.719 --> 4490.6
doesn't make any logical sense to me

4489.44 --> 4496.199
that's

4490.6 --> 4496.1990000000005
like is an affront to God itself

4496.239 --> 4503.599999999999
to the truth to logic which is made by

4500.32 --> 4508.199
God it's part of the how things

4503.6 --> 4511.0
work all of it it's it's an affront to

4508.199 --> 4514.678999999999
Creation to have to have faith in

4511.0 --> 4518.8
something that doesn't make logical

4514.679 --> 4521.32
sense right and you have to understand

4518.8 --> 4523.92
though like what does make logical sense

4521.32 --> 4528.08
really means right that doesn't mean

4523.92 --> 4531.679
like oh with how I think of things I

4528.08 --> 4534.719
can't make it fit but

4531.679 --> 4538.4
then I'm going to fill it in and then

4534.719 --> 4541.12
just say like this does make sense even

4538.4 --> 4544.44
though from your perspective it

4541.12 --> 4548.96
doesn't cuz

4544.44 --> 4553.08
like that's stupid but if you actually

4548.96 --> 4555.679
think like no with what I know and how I

4553.08 --> 4559.239
see things I can feel about this

4555.679 --> 4561.679
particular instance that what is

4559.239 --> 4564.759999999999
actually carrying that thing to be the

4561.679 --> 4566.159
way it is is based on things that I have

4564.76 --> 4571.12
no knowledge

4566.159 --> 4574.839999999999
of that you know you are not in the

4571.12 --> 4576.96
know and then trust that there is

4574.84 --> 4579.56
something that makes it work the way it

4576.96 --> 4582.84
does and it's not based on things that

4579.56 --> 4586.52
you know see see how incredibly

4582.84 --> 4586.52
different that is

4587.52 --> 4592.320000000001
if you could just accept with something

4589.6 --> 4594.719
like uh well this is what people say

4592.32 --> 4598.5199999999995
about it but that makes no damn logical

4594.719 --> 4601.88
sense so maybe it is something different

4598.52 --> 4604.92
another energy is carrying this thing

4601.88 --> 4609.08
forth and basic

4604.92 --> 4613.32
reasoning from our perspective

4609.08 --> 4615.159
can't clarify what it is and how it is

4613.32 --> 4617.799999999999
but there must be something that makes

4615.159 --> 4617.799999999999
it what it

4618.08 --> 4625.12
is now that could be considered

4622.88 --> 4626.84
reasonable cuz you're just being honest

4625.12 --> 4629.88
like yeah everything has a reason the

4626.84 --> 4632.92
way it is you might not always

4629.88 --> 4634.76
understand that reason and the knowledge

4632.92 --> 4637.84
that you have in order to try to

4634.76 --> 4640.6
approach an understanding of it might be

4637.84 --> 4642.88
so flawed that you

4640.6 --> 4645.0
simply you're looking in the wrong

4642.88 --> 4647.96
Corner you're approaching it from the

4645.0 --> 4649.12
wrong angle and so you completely miss

4647.96 --> 4652.32
any kind

4649.12 --> 4654.96
of touching

4652.32 --> 4657.239
ground you completely miss it so you

4654.96 --> 4661.52
can't make it logically work with the

4657.239 --> 4664.5199999999995
knowledge you have if you realize

4661.52 --> 4667.52
that then you can

4664.52 --> 4667.52
bypass

4667.56 --> 4676.8
like believing that which makes no

4672.08 --> 4680.0
sense because then you detach [ __ ] from

4676.8 --> 4682.4400000000005
that making sense from your Vantage

4680.0 --> 4686.08
Point by realizing like no that entire

4682.44 --> 4688.239
reason is just wrong and it's based on

4686.08 --> 4691.199
knowledge that I have and I can't make

4688.239 --> 4692.959999999999
it fit so I'm not going to accept it

4691.199 --> 4695.44
just because it's

4692.96 --> 4697.4800000000005
there I'm not going to accept the

4695.44 --> 4703.239
reasoning that is faulty that came out

4697.48 --> 4707.12
of me to try to explain it and instead

4703.239 --> 4710.718999999999
realize I don't have the knowledge or

4707.12 --> 4714.76
Insight in order to

4710.719 --> 4714.76
explain what that thing

4724.84 --> 4729.52
is something to think about very

4727.96 --> 4734.719
inspired for some

4729.52 --> 4734.719
reason today that's cool

4738.0 --> 4741.8
so yeah if you find this very inspiring

4739.96 --> 4743.92
as well don't forget to rogans it up and

4741.8 --> 4746.8
share

4743.92 --> 4750.4400000000005
it and hopefully somebody will donate to

4746.8 --> 4753.92
my PayPal today because I can really use

4750.44 --> 4753.919999999999
it like a

4756.48 --> 4762.919999999999
lot still have like uh what is it slight

4760.44 --> 4767.28
less less than a week

4762.92 --> 4768.8
to that I have to make it so please some

4767.28 --> 4772.8
support would be

4768.8 --> 4774.96
fantastic Jason is rich is he rich I

4772.8 --> 4777.159000000001
don't know if he is but I mean if

4774.96 --> 4781.36
somebody is

4777.159 --> 4786.0
Rich and you appreciate what I'm saying

4781.36 --> 4786.0
it's helping you understand

4786.12 --> 4791.0
things understanding yourself and like

4788.76 --> 4793.360000000001
the paradigms you're dealing with that

4791.0 --> 4795.239
you didn't really find a solution you

4793.36 --> 4797.36
couldn't find a way through

4795.239 --> 4799.678999999999
with what was available to you well then

4797.36 --> 4802.32
maybe I have helped you

4799.679 --> 4806.28
to take a few steps in the right

4802.32 --> 4808.32
direction of actually becoming capable

4806.28 --> 4814.199
of finding a way

4808.32 --> 4814.199
through it's part of what I intend to do

4818.6 --> 4827.280000000001
here all

4820.56 --> 4827.280000000001
right don't have faith in that which you

4827.76 --> 4833.76
can't which you

4829.679 --> 4836.56
can't make yeah it's what you can't make

4833.76 --> 4836.56
logical sense

4837.679 --> 4847.0
of like don't then accept the illogic of

4843.6 --> 4850.360000000001
it and then think you have to believe it

4847.0 --> 4853.6
instead realize that the origin of

4850.36 --> 4855.719
something may simply defy your

4853.6 --> 4859.400000000001
understanding and your knowledge

4855.719 --> 4861.76
base and has probably been misled by the

4859.4 --> 4863.92
people that talk about it like they

4861.76 --> 4865.8
don't have the knowledge base either but

4863.92 --> 4867.92
a lot of people just have this tendency

4865.8 --> 4871.360000000001
like no we have to understand it we have

4867.92 --> 4873.8
to be on top of it so if we can't make

4871.36 --> 4877.48
sense of it with what knowledge we have

4873.8 --> 4879.6
available then we'll just try to force

4877.48 --> 4880.638999999999
it by saying like no you have to have

4879.6 --> 4883.400000000001
faith in

4880.639 --> 4885.96
this why because otherwise you're not on

4883.4 --> 4887.599999999999
top of it

4885.96 --> 4889.84
well maybe you could just accept you're

4887.6 --> 4892.52
not on top of it and that there's

4889.84 --> 4895.56
something there that you don't

4892.52 --> 4899.040000000001
understand I mean is that so heart

4895.56 --> 4901.84
destroying oh my God there's something

4899.04 --> 4903.6
there you don't understand how this is

4901.84 --> 4906.32
oh this is

4903.6 --> 4909.400000000001
unacceptable I mean my status is being

4906.32 --> 4911.799999999999
an almighty God on Earth that knows

4909.4 --> 4914.679
everything is being compromised I might

4911.8 --> 4918.96
not be the ultimate power in control in

4914.679 --> 4921.4
my own mind anymore if I if I surrender

4918.96 --> 4923.12
to the notion that I might not be able

4921.4 --> 4927.799999999999
to understand something with the

4923.12 --> 4927.8
knowledge I have available to me oh my

4928.36 --> 4933.599999999999
God see what I

4931.8 --> 4937.4400000000005
mean I

4933.6 --> 4941.08
mean that's Lucifer guys that's

4937.44 --> 4946.44
Lucifer comes in on the in the back

4941.08 --> 4946.44
door that's Lucifer inside of you

4948.32 --> 4953.679
it's not acceptable that I don't have

4950.56 --> 4956.4400000000005
control over everything because I don't

4953.679 --> 4957.36
have the means available to me to figure

4956.44 --> 4960.839999999999
it

4957.36 --> 4963.639
out so let's just make it up

4960.84 --> 4965.08
then so that I have that feeling again

4963.639 --> 4967.6
like I am in

4965.08 --> 4969.88
control that sounds a lot like Lucifer

4967.6 --> 4969.88
doesn't

4973.0 --> 4979.56
it is that just a seduction a s slight

4976.88 --> 4981.719
seduction of slight lies and alterations

4979.56 --> 4986.56
just so that you can have that sensory

4981.719 --> 4986.56
of being a god being in

4994.52 --> 4997.52
control

5003.12 --> 5007.96
yeah okay debatable t

5008.08 --> 5017.28
uh yeah gifts and go already has a a

5012.48 --> 5017.28
prayer system in it debatable so

5018.04 --> 5026.56
yeah I mean check it out give send go it

5022.96 --> 5028.159
literally has a prayer system in it so

5026.56 --> 5031.159000000001
you're not the first one to think of

5028.159 --> 5031.159
that

5039.04 --> 5043.239
right but yeah I don't really need

5040.639 --> 5046.4800000000005
prayers right now I mean prayers are

5043.239 --> 5049.12
nice it's a good intention it's all cute

5046.48 --> 5053.879999999999
what I really need is some financial

5049.12 --> 5053.88
support that would be really helpful

5091.48 --> 5094.48
ah

5109.35 --> 5115.04
[Music]

5110.6 --> 5115.04
okay I guess not

5129.199 --> 5132.199
okay

5141.95 --> 5145.0199999999995
[Applause]

5162.28 --> 5165.28
for

5187.49 --> 5190.5689999999995
[Music]

5196.52 --> 5202.92
yeah spal linearity assumption bias and

5199.48 --> 5206.5599999999995
the faith Paradigm I like it like the

5202.92 --> 5211.08
title very inspired

5206.56 --> 5211.080000000001
today hey stepen Jaris

5215.239 --> 5220.839999999999
can one with the FL no Steph Joe no I'm

5218.36 --> 5220.839999999999
done with

5239.08 --> 5246.08
that closet wow debatable D that sounds

5242.8 --> 5248.92
kind of gay

5246.08 --> 5251.92
but I think there's already things like

5248.92 --> 5251.92
that

5291.55 --> 5296.96
[Music]

5294.6 --> 5299.400000000001
you just realized that you're three

5296.96 --> 5299.4
minutes

5299.76 --> 5302.76
behind

5303.119 --> 5307.08
okay for

5334.52 --> 5339.56
but can I get some feedback from all of

5336.6 --> 5342.56
you guys about

5339.56 --> 5342.56
faith

5343.84 --> 5348.159000000001
right faith that something can exist

5346.52 --> 5349.92
even though you don't understand it with

5348.159 --> 5353.839999999999
the knowledge you have

5349.92 --> 5358.0
available and that Faith shouldn't

5353.84 --> 5360.96
be a justification of something that

5358.0 --> 5365.119
doesn't make any sense that you be

5360.96 --> 5365.119
intimidated or fearful

5365.76 --> 5371.0
to

5367.48 --> 5371.0
not declare

5376.4 --> 5381.759999999999
it

5378.159 --> 5383.92
right like don't accept something that

5381.76 --> 5388.639
you can't make sense

5383.92 --> 5388.639
of because you feel you have

5392.0 --> 5398.52
to it's like the the the Trinity or the

5395.679 --> 5401.0
yeah the that kind of thing like with

5398.52 --> 5403.639
the logical explanations that are now be

5401.0 --> 5405.6
going around about it with Jesus Christ

5403.639 --> 5408.119
being the Trinity and all that like yeah

5405.6 --> 5411.52
logically that makes absolutely no sense

5408.119 --> 5416.48
whatsoever so why would

5411.52 --> 5419.92
you then Echo those illogical

5416.48 --> 5422.638999999999
things when there could be something

5419.92 --> 5425.96
there something that's really important

5422.639 --> 5425.96
in a way

5426.52 --> 5435.0
but it wouldn't be the illogical things

5432.159 --> 5439.32
that could be said about

5435.0 --> 5442.6
it so why not just instead say like

5439.32 --> 5445.48
no there's something there something I

5442.6 --> 5450.76
don't really understand but I can feel

5445.48 --> 5453.239
it and I'm not going to try to justify

5450.76 --> 5455.400000000001
it or fill it in with the things that

5453.239 --> 5459.119
are being said about it because that's

5455.4 --> 5461.48
illogical and technically anything

5459.119 --> 5465.92
illogical is not of

5461.48 --> 5468.28
God like it's not the truth illogic is

5465.92 --> 5468.28
not

5468.4 --> 5475.36
truth broken logic it's not part of the

5471.56 --> 5476.2390000000005
akashic record it's wrong it's the devil

5475.36 --> 5479.48
it's

5476.239 --> 5485.159
Satan illogic can never be

5479.48 --> 5485.159
God like a paradox can never be reality

5485.28 --> 5491.96
but there could be something there that

5488.52 --> 5495.1990000000005
you simply don't have the tools or the

5491.96 --> 5496.0
knowledge to properly explain it or fill

5495.199 --> 5500.199
it

5496.0 --> 5504.199
in because if you tried it you'd end

5500.199 --> 5505.879999999999
up contradicting yourself with it and

5504.199 --> 5507.678999999999
then if you're contradicting yourself

5505.88 --> 5510.08
why would you accept a

5507.679 --> 5513.4800000000005
self-contradiction or illogic or a

5510.08 --> 5516.28
paradox as truth because you would have

5513.48 --> 5519.4
to like that makes no

5516.28 --> 5523.5599999999995
sense instead I would recommend just

5519.4 --> 5525.04
retract the attempt to make sense of it

5523.56 --> 5527.400000000001
with the knowledge you have available

5525.04 --> 5528.76
and instead trust no there's something

5527.4 --> 5532.159
there I can feel

5528.76 --> 5537.400000000001
it I just don't know how to explain

5532.159 --> 5542.32
it wouldn't that be more honest with

5537.4 --> 5542.32
yourself and towards God

5550.239 --> 5556.04
right clutch yeah I know I know you you

5553.04 --> 5556.04
are you get

5561.04 --> 5566.84
it I wouldn't even consider God as a

5563.84 --> 5569.84
person I think that person calling God

5566.84 --> 5572.4800000000005
the designer a person is like a

5569.84 --> 5575.0
downgrade like a massive

5572.48 --> 5577.839999999999
downgrade it's it's like a goldfish

5575.0 --> 5580.32
looking up to a a human and thinking

5577.84 --> 5583.4400000000005
like what kind of goldfish is that it's

5580.32 --> 5588.159
a very big goldfish like no it's not a

5583.44 --> 5590.839999999999
goldfish not even close right but I mean

5588.159 --> 5595.08
that that's me and how I perceive it I

5590.84 --> 5595.08
take it all very heavy

5611.679 --> 5615.56
like to me like this might yeah it's a

5613.76 --> 5618.360000000001
bit personal but it sounds a bit weird

5615.56 --> 5622.1990000000005
perhaps but in a way like I

5618.36 --> 5625.639
don't really pray to God

5622.199 --> 5627.678999999999
directly unless I'm like really at at at

5625.639 --> 5631.08
the bottom like unless I'm like feeling

5627.679 --> 5631.08
like I'm about to die or

5631.52 --> 5638.719
something but like I don't appeal to God

5635.84 --> 5640.84
because I feel like I'm just an ant

5638.719 --> 5644.0
that's walking up to a King trying to

5640.84 --> 5648.119000000001
make demands or something I like

5644.0 --> 5650.32
feel or I'm aware of my

5648.119 --> 5653.599999999999
unworthiness so I'm like I'm not going

5650.32 --> 5654.799999999999
to bother God I will just I will

5653.6 --> 5659.280000000001
definitely

5654.8 --> 5663.119000000001
be very happy with the default help that

5659.28 --> 5664.96
God will give me through his angels and

5663.119 --> 5667.639
through the Great of Jesus Christ which

5664.96 --> 5671.2390000000005
is basically part of

5667.639 --> 5672.639
that so I'm very much satisfied to

5671.239 --> 5675.04
settle with

5672.639 --> 5680.88
Representatives indirect representatives

5675.04 --> 5680.88
and and not like the actual God which

5681.199 --> 5687.159
is like it feels to me insane that

5684.56 --> 5690.56
somebody would like literally petition

5687.159 --> 5695.5199999999995
the god like are you

5690.56 --> 5699.679
nuts but that's just how I see it

5695.52 --> 5703.080000000001
like my God my view of actual creation

5699.679 --> 5706.1990000000005
God is is truly all

5703.08 --> 5708.119
powerful and when you say that like

5706.199 --> 5710.48
people tend to think like oh it's all

5708.119 --> 5713.199
powerful all knowing oh but yet you'll

5710.48 --> 5715.599999999999
still talk directly oh oh God will you

5713.199 --> 5720.799999999999
help me this oh I just wanted to live

5715.6 --> 5723.08
nice and I'm like dude that's insane to

5720.8 --> 5727.04
me that that's from my personal

5723.08 --> 5729.88
perspective like I'm like wow you think

5727.04 --> 5731.84
all of that but yet you're going to

5729.88 --> 5734.4800000000005
approach him almost like an

5731.84 --> 5738.04
equal that's

5734.48 --> 5738.04
crazy from my

5743.159 --> 5750.92
perspective but yeah I mean I guess

5746.36 --> 5750.92
that's part of how I see God

5766.4 --> 5773.04
yeah clutch now that sense did make it

5769.0 --> 5779.36
sense it just really sopic phonetic

5773.04 --> 5779.36
talk it's more a sign that Moxy is just

5779.8 --> 5785.88
dislexic not very good at English that's

5783.639 --> 5785.88
what that

5802.92 --> 5811.52
CHS cat SP is a

5806.76 --> 5816.360000000001
cat dog Dog Father must be

5811.52 --> 5816.360000000001
humanoid yeah or father is simply a

5823.36 --> 5831.08
title but I mean our father like how is

5828.32 --> 5835.04
that like what is our father then right

5831.08 --> 5837.96
is the father is that the designer the

5835.04 --> 5840.159
mind or is it the shaper the one that

5837.96 --> 5842.719
actually put the body

5840.159 --> 5844.879999999999
together that made the physical vessel

5842.719 --> 5846.199
see see where the complication already

5844.88 --> 5849.8
gets in there

5846.199 --> 5853.119
right so yeah maybe the Shapers that

5849.8 --> 5857.119000000001
made us the Elohim that manifested on

5853.119 --> 5860.32
the earth shaped it and then made humans

5857.119 --> 5862.4
from clay as they say maybe they were

5860.32 --> 5866.199
humanoid

5862.4 --> 5869.32
indeed does that mean that the original

5866.199 --> 5873.5599999999995
God the designer who outside of physical

5869.32 --> 5877.5199999999995
reality is humanoid too or is he just

5873.56 --> 5877.52
in spirit very similar to

5879.719 --> 5884.52
humanoid see how complicate complicated

5882.8 --> 5888.4800000000005
that

5884.52 --> 5890.320000000001
gets like which which parent do you mean

5888.48 --> 5892.08
do you mean the the father of the

5890.32 --> 5893.96
physical vessel or do you mean the

5892.08 --> 5896.84
father of the

5893.96 --> 5901.88
spirit gets a little complicated there

5896.84 --> 5901.88
right not so straightforward now

5911.36 --> 5915.639
hey gaining wisdom good to see you

5934.76 --> 5938.4800000000005
the hell are you talking about

5945.28 --> 5953.679
duper the name no duper stop trying to

5948.96 --> 5953.679
remember things you suck at it

5974.159 --> 5978.598999999999
no duper I'm not going to look it up and

5983.0 --> 5990.4
stupid I mean I got it directly from the

5986.76 --> 5996.92
Bible in this case the Elohim from the

5990.4 --> 5996.92
Bible not the name of a Pagan God

6035.84 --> 6039.8
who

6036.88 --> 6042.1990000000005
says the [ __ ] does that have to do with

6039.8 --> 6042.1990000000005
anything

6042.92 --> 6047.8
duper we're talking about the meaning of

6045.599 --> 6051.360000000001
a word in the

6047.8 --> 6054.2390000000005
origin not whether the Bible was altered

6051.36 --> 6059.48
or not like I say the B's alar has

6054.239 --> 6059.48
nothing to do with the use of the word

6082.239 --> 6086.28
Elohim for

6142.159 --> 6146.159
wow for

6178.28 --> 6186.48
no he doesn't debatable

6182.8 --> 6189.400000000001
D no he's exactly

6186.48 --> 6191.839999999999
right you sound a

6189.4 --> 6194.839999999999
little Annoying

6191.84 --> 6194.84
there

6199.719 --> 6203.96
obnoxious what the

6204.2 --> 6207.398999999999
[Music]

6224.8 --> 6230.400000000001
literally what the Gnostic said so

6246.719 --> 6254.56
am I into the mandal of Moxy could you

6250.719 --> 6256.52
just stop could you just stop typing

6254.56 --> 6259.360000000001
until you get out of the damn car this

6256.52 --> 6263.679
is just embarrassing

6259.36 --> 6263.679
dude just stop

6276.48 --> 6281.44
he sounded a little Gnostic yeah well

6279.48 --> 6283.598999999999
I'm

6281.44 --> 6286.159
sorry I don't know what the hell that

6283.599 --> 6289.4400000000005
has to do like sounded a little Gnostic

6286.159 --> 6292.799999999999
Oh you mean the Gnostic which denies the

6289.44 --> 6295.879999999999
existence of any God and claims that you

6292.8 --> 6297.92
are are the God if you just realize it

6295.88 --> 6299.679
like why the hell would you draw a word

6297.92 --> 6302.56
in like

6299.679 --> 6304.679
that just because you caught some of

6302.56 --> 6308.719
them saying something similar that's

6304.679 --> 6311.32
just super rude debatable D it's super

6308.719 --> 6311.32
super

6315.36 --> 6321.759999999999
rude unless it's just the the goto

6318.8 --> 6326.119000000001
phrase for anybody that like oh so you

6321.76 --> 6328.639
don't chant the hardcore Faith

6326.119 --> 6331.199
nonsense so you don't chant the exact

6328.639 --> 6333.76
chant so you're going to go to hell and

6331.199 --> 6336.159
if you if you think something slightly

6333.76 --> 6338.04
different as what what you have to chant

6336.159 --> 6340.799999999999
well then you're Gnostic yeah unless

6338.04 --> 6344.56
you're one of those types debatable D

6340.8 --> 6344.56
you better just stop

6351.0 --> 6356.96
talking read up another tic

6354.199 --> 6361.4
tradition sounds like you've read up a

6356.96 --> 6361.4
gnostic tradition there de B

6397.1 --> 6401.88
[Music]

6398.88 --> 6401.88
in

6413.44 --> 6419.5599999999995
yeah well CL debatable D you sound a

6416.36 --> 6423.36
little divisive and satanic is that is

6419.56 --> 6426.280000000001
that good with you huh you sound just

6423.36 --> 6430.799999999999
like a Satanist cuz you're bringing up a

6426.28 --> 6432.88
a very obviously divisive Point has no

6430.8 --> 6436.400000000001
point to be made other than to be

6432.88 --> 6439.28
divisive yeah this little value can you

6436.4 --> 6442.0
can get out of your statement other than

6439.28 --> 6444.719
the division it creates sounds a little

6442.0 --> 6446.08
satanic does it debatable D yeah are you

6444.719 --> 6447.36
going to agree to that too that you

6446.08 --> 6450.679
sound a little

6447.36 --> 6454.36
satanic with what you've

6450.679 --> 6457.36
said a little divisive for no damn

6454.36 --> 6457.36
reason

6464.36 --> 6470.36
yeah or or you think that's too far you

6468.199 --> 6473.879999999999
don't like to

6470.36 --> 6477.239
be compared to say

6473.88 --> 6479.719
satanists because you sound a little bit

6477.239 --> 6482.718999999999
like something that they would do is

6479.719 --> 6486.4800000000005
that going too far for

6482.719 --> 6489.159
you cuz yeah people that take Christ

6486.48 --> 6492.159
serious they don't like to be called

6489.159 --> 6492.159
gnostics

6496.48 --> 6502.119
yeah can't speak your mind no no you

6499.88 --> 6504.679
can't speak your mind it's just what's

6502.119 --> 6508.04
the point of calling him a

6504.679 --> 6513.36
gnostic not even call saying associating

6508.04 --> 6516.36
gnosticism with him because he said

6513.36 --> 6516.36
something

6518.199 --> 6524.119
yeah so so now you think that you can't

6521.0 --> 6526.8
speak your mind what because I did the

6524.119 --> 6529.719
same thing to you that you did to

6526.8 --> 6534.2390000000005
him I mean what's the problem I mean you

6529.719 --> 6537.0
only sounded a little satanic only just

6534.239 --> 6538.919999999999
a little bit of divisiveness for no damn

6537.0 --> 6541.28
reason no constructive reason to bring

6538.92 --> 6543.08
it up at all I mean what's the problem

6541.28 --> 6544.28
it just sounded a little satanic

6543.08 --> 6549.5199999999995
debatable

6544.28 --> 6549.5199999999995
D why are you so triggered over that

6549.8 --> 6556.0
right I mean I'm merely reflecting back

6552.96 --> 6557.84
onto you exactly what you just did

6556.0 --> 6562.199
that's

6557.84 --> 6564.08
all right just relax I mean all that

6562.199 --> 6566.839999999999
I've said is that you sounded a little

6564.08 --> 6569.36
satanic there I mean what's the

6566.84 --> 6572.4400000000005
problem right that doesn't mean anything

6569.36 --> 6574.679
that shouldn't have any impact on you

6572.44 --> 6576.919999999999
why are you so responsive to it just

6574.679 --> 6578.04
relax right I mean you just get called a

6576.92 --> 6580.56
little

6578.04 --> 6582.92
satanic just sounded like it I'm not

6580.56 --> 6584.96
saying you're a Satanist it's just that

6582.92 --> 6587.88
oh well the way that you acted is well

6584.96 --> 6591.4800000000005
very similar to what satanists do and

6587.88 --> 6594.639
and that's all why would you be insulted

6591.48 --> 6594.638999999999
by that right

6600.679 --> 6606.36
yeah yeah keep keep doubling down

6603.56 --> 6609.8
debatable D keep doubling down on your

6606.36 --> 6612.36
hor [ __ ] don't ever learn

6609.8 --> 6614.4800000000005
anything especially when it's shoved

6612.36 --> 6616.799999999999
right in your face never learn anything

6614.48 --> 6620.28
debatable D keep it

6616.8 --> 6624.639
up just double down on your hor

6620.28 --> 6624.639
[ __ ] don't learn any lesson

6624.88 --> 6629.88

6654.48 --> 6658.36
D does sound a little belly Bubby yeah I

6657.04 --> 6660.639
don't know why you would get all

6658.36 --> 6663.199
insulted I mean what's the problem it

6660.639 --> 6665.599
just sounded a little bit like that

6663.199 --> 6667.48
right I mean don't know why he's just

6665.599 --> 6669.599
suddenly so defensive all of a sudden I

6667.48 --> 6673.36
mean I'm only saying you sound a little

6669.599 --> 6677.04
satanic I mean what's so bad about that

6673.36 --> 6679.639
right just like clutch just sound a

6677.04 --> 6681.8
little Gnostic I mean what's the problem

6679.639 --> 6683.96
why is would he have any response to

6681.8 --> 6686.96
that whatsoever

6683.96 --> 6689.32
oh maybe for the same reason why you're

6686.96 --> 6691.4
being a little responsive to me saying

6689.32 --> 6695.84
that you sounded a little satanic with

6691.4 --> 6695.839999999999
actual reasoning behind it as well

6696.079 --> 6702.759999999999

6735.8 --> 6742.56
denialism is that is offensive to me

6740.4 --> 6744.96
like the way he responded to all that is

6742.56 --> 6747.76
more offensive to me than actually

6744.96 --> 6750.079
calling you a gnostic indirectly oh you

6747.76 --> 6751.8
only sounded like one oh really yeah

6750.079 --> 6754.159
yeah

6751.8 --> 6758.320000000001

6961.679 --> 6966.56
notice you do that more often I will ban

6964.159 --> 6970.879999999999
you because you're only here to be a

6966.56 --> 6972.360000000001
troll then okay carrots got banned did

6970.88 --> 6976.28
Gary do

6972.36 --> 6978.119
music so I'll see you tomorrow perhaps

6976.28 --> 6979.639
if I notice you do that again and that's

6978.119 --> 6983.88
the only thing you're going to pipe up

6979.639 --> 6987.079
for I will com complete ban

6983.88 --> 6990.159000000001
you yeah cuz I'm having a a serious

6987.079 --> 6991.4
discussion here and addressed somebody

6990.159 --> 6994.119
on their

6991.4 --> 6996.119
behavior they refused to learn got

6994.119 --> 7000.159
arrogant as [ __ ] over

6996.119 --> 7003.639
it then I reprimand them yeah that's not

7000.159 --> 7006.0
your time to pipe up and be an [ __ ]

7003.639 --> 7011.76
to undermine me some

7006.0 --> 7011.76
more yeah my point that I made was legit

7034.84 --> 7041.400000000001
all right I'm L just fine with clutch

7037.56 --> 7041.400000000001
and clear here

7049.48 --> 7053.638999999999
freaking

7050.599 --> 7057.56
nostics I mean I kind of like a lot

7053.639 --> 7059.599
about gnosticism except their

7057.56 --> 7063.400000000001
foundations if that even is their

7059.599 --> 7066.04
foundations because like is nosism even

7063.4 --> 7068.5599999999995
a consistent

7066.04 --> 7071.5199999999995
definable philosophy anymore at this

7068.56 --> 7074.119000000001
point it's all universally associated

7071.52 --> 7077.4400000000005
with like all you don't believe in a

7074.119 --> 7080.799999999999
universal God and you think that you're

7077.44 --> 7083.239
the God and you just have to realize it

7080.8 --> 7085.84
well I just fundamentally disagree with

7083.239 --> 7090.159
that entire perspective and absolutely

7085.84 --> 7090.159000000001
there is a God outside of my

7091.599 --> 7098.2390000000005
Consciousness but that's about it like

7095.88 --> 7100.159000000001
like the very Foundation which in this

7098.239 --> 7102.598999999999
case is assumed that that is the

7100.159 --> 7106.079
foundation is just complet completely

7102.599 --> 7106.079
wrong from my

7106.4 --> 7114.44
perspective but whatever other ideas

7109.679 --> 7114.4400000000005
gnostics May typically have can be very

7114.56 --> 7120.119000000001
interesting but because of that

7116.76 --> 7122.679
foundational view saying that you you

7120.119 --> 7124.159
sound a little Gnostic well what's the

7122.679 --> 7127.4400000000005
only thing that's like really

7124.159 --> 7129.44
consistently known about gnostics or

7127.44 --> 7132.719
assumed about them well that

7129.44 --> 7136.5599999999995
foundational philosophical View right

7132.719 --> 7139.119
because everything else they think and

7136.56 --> 7141.76
talk about is very broad so there's no

7139.119 --> 7143.719
thing you can really sing aloud except

7141.76 --> 7146.88
the foundational

7143.719 --> 7149.119
philosophy which is kind of

7146.88 --> 7151.8
insulting to anybody that actually

7149.119 --> 7151.799999999999
believes in

7155.159 --> 7161.239
God gnostics and copics are great

7159.36 --> 7164.32
because they aren't pans anything that's

7161.239 --> 7164.32
not poan is

7168.079 --> 7171.679
great Paul and

7174.44 --> 7180.36
suck wasn't Paul like

7177.159 --> 7184.0
also responsible for basically

7180.36 --> 7186.679
Christians having to have faith in that

7184.0 --> 7188.719
which makes no sense it's that's

7186.679 --> 7192.76
basically his fault isn't

7188.719 --> 7193.8
it terrible absolutely terrible

7192.76 --> 7197.159000000001
I

7193.8 --> 7200.1990000000005
mean by all means if you have any

7197.159 --> 7203.44
problems with that then just see it like

7200.199 --> 7206.598999999999
I explained earlier right from when I

7203.44 --> 7211.239
started to talk about the faith

7206.599 --> 7213.639
Paradigm something could be

7211.239 --> 7216.718999999999
there and you could feel that it's

7213.639 --> 7219.52
really important but then don't try to

7216.719 --> 7222.28
explain it from your Vantage Point if

7219.52 --> 7225.52
that explanation leads to it making no

7222.28 --> 7227.32
damn sense and then feel forced to

7225.52 --> 7229.599
accept that thing that doesn't make

7227.32 --> 7231.88
sense you should never do that you

7229.599 --> 7234.52
should then just leave out the attempt

7231.88 --> 7236.28
of explanation and just say there is

7234.52 --> 7239.400000000001
something there that I can't fully

7236.28 --> 7241.639
explain but I definitely think it's

7239.4 --> 7245.0
real like that's

7241.639 --> 7245.0
honesty that's

7246.04 --> 7252.639
humility don't fill it in if the fill in

7249.119 --> 7254.799999999999
makes no sense don't say that it does

7252.639 --> 7257.159000000001
make sense even though it doesn't just

7254.8 --> 7262.400000000001
because you feel like you need to have

7257.159 --> 7262.4
that grip that control that power over

7273.44 --> 7276.44
it

7276.679 --> 7282.04
God that's not a

7279.239 --> 7286.32
poon Moxy just could you just stop

7282.04 --> 7286.32
trying to type this is

7286.4 --> 7293.079
terrible yeah aolan is is like a

7290.0 --> 7297.239
Christian that specifically follows

7293.079 --> 7300.0
Paul Saul Paul in the

7297.239 --> 7306.44
Bible and that believes that Paul

7300.0 --> 7306.44
supersedes Jesus Christ that say paulan

7322.28 --> 7329.599
where did Paul say he met

7324.56 --> 7329.599
him on the road to Damascus wasn't

7333.48 --> 7341.638999999999
it in the desert that's that's a

7337.76 --> 7341.639
interesting point clutch

7351.28 --> 7356.84
huh that's that's fascinating like I

7354.079 --> 7358.48
never heard of that before but I mean

7356.84 --> 7362.32
yeah the

7358.48 --> 7362.32
Bible is full of

7363.04 --> 7368.719
stuff interesting esoteric puzzles

7377.719 --> 7384.84
and it's full of hints I mean if you

7381.32 --> 7386.4
really really look specifically at Jesus

7384.84 --> 7389.400000000001
Christ's

7386.4 --> 7392.638999999999
words then you will start to figure out

7389.4 --> 7393.879999999999
how Jesus Christ is being encapsulated

7392.639 --> 7398.76
and

7393.88 --> 7398.76
ignored by other forces even within the

7399.44 --> 7405.079
book Jesus like basically tell tells you

7402.28 --> 7405.079
how he is

7406.84 --> 7413.4800000000005
captured how he's captured and ignored

7409.44 --> 7416.598999999999
and distorted he he tells

7413.48 --> 7420.5199999999995
you he warns about

7416.599 --> 7420.52
it warns about the

7420.8 --> 7425.84
future he he tells you the the

7423.88 --> 7429.559
parameters of how it really is and

7425.84 --> 7433.400000000001
should be and look what's happened with

7429.559 --> 7436.599
that it's all been discarded

7433.4 --> 7439.759999999999
downplayed like Jesus's statements that

7436.599 --> 7442.559
are like incredible are downplayed they

7439.76 --> 7445.360000000001
declare him literally a God and then

7442.559 --> 7450.1990000000005
they downplay the words of the the one

7445.36 --> 7454.159
that they declared a God I mean it's all

7450.199 --> 7456.5199999999995
terrible it's all inverted it's evil

7454.159 --> 7456.5199999999995
it's

7457.679 --> 7462.36
anti-christian it's all distorted and

7459.88 --> 7466.119
they did it on purpose and people don't

7462.36 --> 7466.119
even realize that that's what it

7478.0 --> 7485.199
is James the just got erased from the

7481.4 --> 7485.199
new religion what

7517.0 --> 7523.04
a lot gets erased I

7519.679 --> 7526.4800000000005
mean they erased everything

7523.04 --> 7529.599
like before they erased history and then

7526.48 --> 7533.159
the things that they filled it in

7529.599 --> 7536.96
with even those things get

7533.159 --> 7539.32
erased get left out like it doesn't fit

7536.96 --> 7543.599
anymore what it doesn't fit with what

7539.32 --> 7545.96
you want it to fit now or it fits with

7543.599 --> 7547.360000000001
things that you don't want people to

7545.96 --> 7550.04
know

7547.36 --> 7552.199
existed is that why he has to go away

7550.04 --> 7554.5199999999995
because of what's directly what it fits

7552.199 --> 7557.558999999999
in with you don't want people to see

7554.52 --> 7560.040000000001
that hey this fits with another history

7557.559 --> 7560.04
that's not

7560.48 --> 7564.159
told there's a lot of

7565.119 --> 7570.36
it right like hey what are the loose

7567.88 --> 7573.400000000001
ends in this story what are they a part

7570.36 --> 7576.0
of what are what were they connected to

7573.4 --> 7579.879999999999
cuz it doesn't fit in everything else

7576.0 --> 7582.28
right well that's called an open end and

7579.88 --> 7584.1990000000005
that leads the people people trying to

7582.28 --> 7587.0
figure out what those open ends are

7584.199 --> 7587.919999999999
connected to so they get another piece

7587.0 --> 7592.719
of

7587.92 --> 7592.719
history that doesn't fit the main

7597.28 --> 7601.28
story right

7609.21 --> 7612.289
[Music]

7615.639 --> 7618.92
all right anyway hope you are all

7617.04 --> 7622.4
enjoying the

7618.92 --> 7622.4
show it's been

7623.8 --> 7629.119000000001
interesting if you liked it then don't

7626.28 --> 7631.199

7631.199 --> 7636.799999999999
patreon would be very much appreciated

7642.32 --> 7645.32
you

7661.81 --> 7667.21
[Music]

7687.4 --> 7690.4
no

7699.719 --> 7705.04
okay yeah clear exactly yeah that's what

7702.639 --> 7708.76
it started with it's all lazy and it all

7705.04 --> 7712.159
became well what Paul did

7708.76 --> 7714.88
was politicize their

7712.159 --> 7719.44
religion make it

7714.88 --> 7722.1990000000005
a yes or no situation right not a

7719.44 --> 7724.36
struggle that you have to like face you

7722.199 --> 7726.32
have to face the challenges and and do

7724.36 --> 7729.839999999999
your best and keep that tight Middle

7726.32 --> 7732.199
Road no it's about do you accept this

7729.84 --> 7734.360000000001
thing yes oh that's all good oh you

7732.199 --> 7736.879999999999
don't accept it or struggle against

7734.36 --> 7740.759999999999
somehow then you're the bitter bitter

7736.88 --> 7741.96
evil so it it turned it political that's

7740.76 --> 7746.4400000000005
what Paul

7741.96 --> 7749.8
did with his paradigm shift and it's the

7746.44 --> 7752.28
worst it's potentially a justification

7749.8 --> 7754.88
for

7752.28 --> 7757.199
innumerable atrocities that the Catholic

7754.88 --> 7757.1990000000005
Church

7757.92 --> 7766.8
committed a lot of the atrocity

7762.239 --> 7769.44
perpetrators back then would have fallen

7766.8 --> 7772.159000000001
back to Paul's

7769.44 --> 7775.5199999999995
Paradigm just to

7772.159 --> 7775.5199999999995
justify the

7776.84 --> 7784.0
gross yeah political

7781.44 --> 7786.598999999999
violation that they

7784.0 --> 7790.0
did he made it possible for them he

7786.599 --> 7792.119000000001
justified it through those through those

7790.0 --> 7797.639
statements

7792.119 --> 7800.079
Saul Paul made it into a political

7797.639 --> 7803.079
system instead of an

7800.079 --> 7803.079
individual

7804.04 --> 7807.32
journey and

7810.76 --> 7816.96
test yeah and it crazy yeah it is so

7814.44 --> 7819.96
crazy that like even on record there

7816.96 --> 7822.96
it's like yeah Paul killed a whole bunch

7819.96 --> 7825.0
of Christians like oh well that's

7822.96 --> 7827.8
definitely the one we should trust that

7825.0 --> 7829.639
they saw Christ and suddenly said

7827.8 --> 7831.599
everything is different I mean yes of

7829.639 --> 7833.4400000000005
course the one that actually killed a

7831.599 --> 7835.8
whole bunch of Christians why why don't

7833.44 --> 7839.159
we trust him to be the new religious

7835.8 --> 7844.719
leader like

7839.159 --> 7844.719
what how could you fall for that [ __ ]

7852.44 --> 7854.839999999999
oh hold

7880.239 --> 7884.28
on e

7933.98 --> 7939.28
[Music]

7935.84 --> 7942.679
oh you're right thanks clutch yeah I was

7939.28 --> 7945.5199999999995
muted no that that it's not just on your

7942.679 --> 7949.119
end yeah but I was saying like I'm

7945.52 --> 7949.119000000001
probably going to round out the show

7952.28 --> 7956.04
soon even though it's still

7960.84 --> 7965.28
early why would CHR say those with ears

7964.199 --> 7970.919999999999
and

7965.28 --> 7970.92
eyes what does that mean for the others

7972.719 --> 7975.119
what

7981.639 --> 7987.92
what what do you mean gaining wisdom you

7984.84 --> 7987.92
have to be a little bit more

7988.239 --> 7991.879999999999
elaborate do you mean eyes to see ears

7991.119 --> 7994.48
to

7991.88 --> 7996.88
hear well that's basically those that

7994.48 --> 8003.119
are not deafened or

7996.88 --> 8003.119
blinded because of imposed upon riddles

8004.4 --> 8007.28
blinded by

8008.52 --> 8013.040000000001
conditioning right and by the way under

8010.88 --> 8015.719
such conditioning also

8013.04 --> 8018.119
falls effects that relate to physicality

8015.719 --> 8019.599
assumption bias or special linearity

8018.119 --> 8024.88
assumption

8019.599 --> 8024.88
bias like those are kind of baked into

8025.119 --> 8030.799999999999
it just the way that we are raised and

8028.159 --> 8033.04
how how we assume things are and should

8030.8 --> 8033.04
be

8045.4 --> 8051.32
all right see through the delusion see

8048.199 --> 8055.598999999999
through the imposed upon societal

8051.32 --> 8055.599
Norms think that

8062.88 --> 8070.0
wisdom speaks in riddles sometimes

8067.4 --> 8073.92
yeah it likes to make it into a little

8070.0 --> 8076.32
bit of a puzzle but I mean I do that too

8073.92 --> 8079.1990000000005
or I have done that a lot I don't really

8076.32 --> 8079.199
do it as much

8079.92 --> 8086.04
now but I probably will do so more

8114.639 --> 8117.84
all right

8124.82 --> 8127.92
[Music]

8145.04 --> 8152.0
e just don't doer don't bring that

8149.36 --> 8155.28
[ __ ] word up

8152.0 --> 8155.28
don't bring that up

8165.76 --> 8171.280000000001
duper yeah good and hey if Nathan wants

8168.52 --> 8174.119000000001
to do all that crap on his show and he

8171.28 --> 8178.36
wants to be associated with that that's

8174.119 --> 8182.558999999999
his disgusting problem yeah not mine

8178.36 --> 8186.4
yeah I don't have to be part of his team

8182.559 --> 8186.400000000001
in which he says that kind of

8186.96 --> 8193.359
crap yeah he can do that he could be

8190.4 --> 8195.199999999999
dude he can be a [ __ ] statan as far

8193.359 --> 8198.559000000001
as I'm concerned he can become part of

8195.2 --> 8201.960000000001
the BBC or the freaking UK government

8198.559 --> 8205.479
all he likes I don't have to know about

8201.96 --> 8205.479
it it's not my problem

8205.92 --> 8214.439
anymore I certainly don't accept it

8211.439 --> 8214.439
yo

8241.519 --> 8245.479
he would but taste

8263.96 --> 8269.96
what de ARA Christ yeah

8274.12 --> 8279.439
yeah it's complicated clutch but I mean

8276.479 --> 8283.039999999999
Christ was very likely there a thousand

8279.439 --> 8283.04
years ago not 2,000 years

8283.559 --> 8287.559
ago right

8303.04 --> 8307.160000000002
in the short season I don't exactly what

8305.2 --> 8310.12
the short season is but I mean it

8307.16 --> 8314.08
certainly does seem like this 21st

8310.12 --> 8317.12
century is the unfolding of Satan's plan

8314.08 --> 8318.679
to conquer us through mind control and

8317.12 --> 8321.399000000001
lies and

8318.679 --> 8325.8
complicated technological advancement

8321.399 --> 8325.8
and lots and lots of delusion

8333.08 --> 8337.679
oh really the wolf pack okay thanks for

8336.28 --> 8340.479000000001
tell yeah sure I'll have sleeping

8337.679 --> 8340.479
Warrior on why

8342.04 --> 8347.399000000001
not although yeah I think he has me

8345.12 --> 8350.0
potentially like blocked on Skype though

8347.399 --> 8353.439
I don't know why I've said to him hello

8350.0 --> 8353.439
a while ago

8362.319 --> 8366.319
message him uh he's not

8378.92 --> 8383.76
responding so wolf I appreciate you

8381.84 --> 8385.880000000001
reaching out and all that but I mean if

8383.76 --> 8389.2
you could like address him again and

8385.88 --> 8394.839999999998
tell him to like

8389.2 --> 8400.16
just open up Skype or find me by my name

8394.84 --> 8404.6
there and then unhide it right you can

8400.16 --> 8407.64
do that you can like search search Skype

8404.6 --> 8410.359
get the right name open it up and then

8407.64 --> 8412.358999999999
unhide it because if he hit it or

8410.359 --> 8417.24
something or blocked it then it's all

8412.359 --> 8420.84
just going to be not in the list for him

8417.24 --> 8420.84
I've had that issue

8424.84 --> 8430.2
guests are great yeah we'll try oh

8427.24 --> 8433.119999999999
thanks Wolfpack I appreciate

8430.2 --> 8435.399000000001
that but yeah now it would be fine if if

8433.12 --> 8436.960000000001
he wants to come on but I mean it could

8435.399 --> 8438.88
be that this weekend there's not going

8436.96 --> 8440.479
to be like a night all show there

8438.88 --> 8442.279999999999
definitely no guarantee that there's

8440.479 --> 8445.279999999999
going to be like a night all show every

8442.28 --> 8445.28
weekend

8467.0 --> 8471.96
oh okay wow is that so

8473.64 --> 8480.599999999999
clutch huh well in that case clutch I'd

8477.64 --> 8485.08
say that yeah we are in that short

8480.6 --> 8486.76
season like very very up up front in

8485.08 --> 8491.52
your

8486.76 --> 8491.52
faces wouldn't you say that

8515.72 --> 8520.92
struggle with the but why though I mean

8518.8 --> 8524.319
if that is something that was said a

8520.92 --> 8526.399
thousand years and you kind of know you

8524.319 --> 8530.399
should know

8526.399 --> 8534.68
that Christ was a thousand years ago not

8530.399 --> 8536.439
2,000 and just look at what they did 911

8534.68 --> 8539.56
on

8536.439 --> 8541.319
2001 it's almost like announcing like

8539.56 --> 8544.72
hey the devil is back back we're going

8541.319 --> 8544.72
to do it on Christ's

8546.68 --> 8554.2
birthday and they haven't stopped ever

8550.8 --> 8554.199999999999
since still

8569.439 --> 8572.439
happening

8595.01 --> 8598.139000000001
[Music]

8599.439 --> 8607.349
for e

8602.31 --> 8607.349
[Applause]

8612.27 --> 8616.549
[Music]

8618.02 --> 8621.139000000001
[Applause]

8636.0 --> 8640.319
that he came back and reigned a

8648.279 --> 8651.279
thousand

8656.16 --> 8663.56
yeah the Thousand yeah but I mean he

8658.76 --> 8663.56
didn't he did he effectively do

8664.359 --> 8670.279
that and I mean as far as I'm concerned

8667.399 --> 8674.358999999999
that Jesus was actually a thousand years

8670.279 --> 8677.0
ago like I I can't even see the world

8674.359 --> 8679.800000000001
different anymore from that like I know

8677.0 --> 8682.8
it is that I know it was a thousand

8679.8 --> 8686.8
years ago like everything that's kind of

8682.8 --> 8690.438999999998
happened makes way more sense that

8686.8 --> 8691.96
way like the religious fanaticism

8690.439 --> 8695.24
makes

8691.96 --> 8700.519999999999
absolutely way more

8695.24 --> 8702.88
sense in the late medieval

8700.52 --> 8704.2
period like it makes all the sense in

8702.88 --> 8707.039999999999
the

8704.2 --> 8710.319000000001
world it also kind of makes sense that

8707.04 --> 8712.439
before that time there were the Romans

8710.319 --> 8715.0
and then after Christ the Romans

8712.439 --> 8717.439
basically transformed themselves into a

8715.0 --> 8721.439
religious

8717.439 --> 8724.960000000001
order and assimilated Chris and turn it

8721.439 --> 8730.6
into their Antichrist Christianity like

8724.96 --> 8730.599999999999
all of that just all fits perfectly

8734.68 --> 8740.6
logically and it reveals how just so

8738.08 --> 8744.72
much has been completely made

8740.6 --> 8746.84
up how they forged most of History even

8744.72 --> 8750.8
the ancient

8746.84 --> 8754.04
past like ancient Greece may be like a

8750.8 --> 8756.519999999999
myth that they made

8754.04 --> 8760.68
entirely a lot of ancient things may

8756.52 --> 8763.439
have been invented to eventually

8760.68 --> 8766.68
replace the ancient things that were

8763.439 --> 8769.319
really there and they were like

8766.68 --> 8771.279
considered like the enemy to those

8769.319 --> 8773.64
people who rewrote the

8771.279 --> 8775.720000000001
history so

8773.64 --> 8778.68
they

8775.72 --> 8782.08
replaced it with their own

8778.68 --> 8783.960000000001
fiction they erased the enemy erased

8782.08 --> 8787.439
them from history and replace them with

8783.96 --> 8787.438999999998
their own fiction

8839.16 --> 8843.16
that for

8882.89 --> 8886.24
[Music]

8899.12 --> 8902.12
that

8929.04 --> 8933.080000000002
for e

8979.0 --> 8984.52
goodie sorry I'm getting distracted here

9009.04 --> 9013.76
yeah yeah yeah clear absolutely you can

9010.88 --> 9017.599999999999
hear it by the tone of

9013.76 --> 9018.56
it like I mean I have spiritual senses

9017.6 --> 9023.04
and all

9018.56 --> 9026.08
that I could just hear it you can

9023.04 --> 9028.68
hear what it's trying to push on you and

9026.08 --> 9028.68
you can just

9033.319 --> 9038.319
tell right the closer it is to Christ

9036.08 --> 9039.92
the more it's just saying things that

9038.319 --> 9043.08
are fractally

9039.92 --> 9046.359
implic that will have eternal value in

9043.08 --> 9049.399
reflection to whatever you think

9046.359 --> 9051.640000000001
of and the further away it goes from

9049.399 --> 9054.119999999999
Christ the more poly in it becomes the

9051.64 --> 9056.319
more it's trying to impose a very

9054.12 --> 9058.92
specific framework of feeling and

9056.319 --> 9062.199999999999
thinking and responding on you a

9058.92 --> 9065.24
programming and you can feel that you

9062.2 --> 9067.800000000001
can feel it from the very scripture and

9065.24 --> 9067.8
how it is

9073.439 --> 9080.279
written yeah very [ __ ] funny Deb D

9076.479 --> 9080.278999999999
don't call it that

9081.16 --> 9085.439
you're not funny you got

9086.319 --> 9089.68
it just

9105.52 --> 9110.24
annoying definitely the one that tries

9107.72 --> 9113.76
to make him yeah

9110.24 --> 9115.88
but you could just feel it out it's just

9113.76 --> 9120.319
the way that is written about Christ

9115.88 --> 9120.319
tells you how close it is to True

9120.56 --> 9125.92
Christ you can tell by what it is trying

9123.52 --> 9129.439
to impose on you what it is trying to

9125.92 --> 9132.76
accomplish it's trying to give you

9129.439 --> 9135.720000000001
fractally implic insights that will last

9132.76 --> 9138.439
forever as long as you don't disregard

9135.72 --> 9141.16
them or ignore them or is it trying to

9138.439 --> 9145.0
impose a certain

9141.16 --> 9147.24
certain General view of how to look how

9145.0 --> 9150.6
to filter

9147.24 --> 9150.6
information on

9154.08 --> 9160.039999999999
you you could call it spiritual

9157.6 --> 9162.640000000001
enrichment it's like oh no no you have

9160.04 --> 9167.640000000001
to think of it like this spiritual

9162.64 --> 9171.24
enrichment extra clutter extra nonsense

9167.64 --> 9173.199999999999
distractions superfluous esoterics

9171.24 --> 9177.399
that's actually a really good way to say

9173.2 --> 9177.399000000001
it Superfluous

9180.16 --> 9185.96
esoterics yeah like oh Jesus Christ is

9183.279 --> 9188.960000000001
God that's

9185.96 --> 9188.96
Superfluous

9189.24 --> 9192.76
esoterics what's the

9194.479 --> 9201.16
point but to distract you and to like

9198.56 --> 9204.16
elevated Beyond

9201.16 --> 9204.16
beond

9205.35 --> 9217.099
[Music]

9228.72 --> 9232.76
necessity for

9268.08 --> 9271.359
all right yeah it's been a very

9269.2 --> 9275.04
stimulating show thus far I really

9271.359 --> 9278.439
appreciate clutch and clear both

9275.04 --> 9282.92
you contributing to

9278.439 --> 9286.16
it and yeah I think I'm I'm getting

9282.92 --> 9288.92
clear and in the flow and all that more

9286.16 --> 9291.52
than in recent days so maybe like some

9288.92 --> 9292.92
of this Haze and clutter in my head is

9291.52 --> 9296.6
finally

9292.92 --> 9296.6
like stopping a

9302.72 --> 9310.039999999999
bit Jesus said don't tell the people

9305.359 --> 9310.04
that I am the Messiah amazing

9318.359 --> 9324.92
L right and I mean oh he said that well

9322.16 --> 9327.119999999999
then definitely Trust on the man that

9324.92 --> 9329.84
says that he is God and everything and

9327.12 --> 9333.2
the fulfiller and we have to follow that

9329.84 --> 9336.439
one not to Jesus actually saying theyy

9333.2 --> 9336.439
don't don't tell him

9341.8 --> 9347.399
that I mean how crazy is that right you

9345.479 --> 9350.16
have this book you have to have absolute

9347.399 --> 9353.84
faith in it and in the book The person

9350.16 --> 9356.279
that is elevated to

9353.84 --> 9359.76
godhood literally says certain things

9356.279 --> 9365.359
like hey don't do this don't do that and

9359.76 --> 9369.0
then others in it say that you do do

9365.359 --> 9373.399000000001
that and then that is what priests in

9369.0 --> 9377.6
the religion say like that's the actual

9373.399 --> 9381.278999999999
rules not what Jesus Christ himself said

9377.6 --> 9383.6
that you collectively elevated to God's

9381.279 --> 9385.560000000001
status like don't listen to the one that

9383.6 --> 9388.16
you're actually elevating to God's

9385.56 --> 9390.64
status and basically committing idolatry

9388.16 --> 9393.119999999999
in the process don't listen to the god

9390.64 --> 9396.84
that you believe in no listen to what

9393.12 --> 9401.279
other people that elevated him to God's

9396.84 --> 9406.56
status say about what you should do I

9401.279 --> 9406.560000000001
mean people fall for this [ __ ]

9410.0 --> 9415.2
H how how how did this

9436.04 --> 9443.960000000001
happen so do you believe them or not can

9440.359 --> 9443.960000000001
we Cherry fig

9484.88 --> 9490.92
right yeah the B I mean

9488.12 --> 9494.92
esoterics like what did he actually mean

9490.92 --> 9499.08
with that could be a whole bunch of

9494.92 --> 9502.64
Priestly code words in there that simply

9499.08 --> 9506.52
we do not have the full context

9502.64 --> 9509.08
to but they kept it as is because it was

9506.52 --> 9509.08
Jesus's

9509.6 --> 9515.960000000001
words and even though everything else

9513.12 --> 9518.52
around him and where it was was probably

9515.96 --> 9522.479
all rearranged and

9518.52 --> 9523.720000000001
erased what he actually said could not

9522.479 --> 9526.119999999999
be

9523.72 --> 9529.119999999999
altered I think that that's what

9526.12 --> 9529.12
happened

9531.16 --> 9537.24
and so there is a lot of esoterics that

9533.56 --> 9539.479
are left in there that are

9537.24 --> 9542.199999999999
referencing things that would have

9539.479 --> 9545.399
actually been real but that are

9542.2 --> 9548.359
not written about in the Bible because

9545.399 --> 9550.8
it is a rewrite it's a rearrangement of

9548.359 --> 9553.880000000001
what actually happened so there's all

9550.8 --> 9556.84
these missing

9553.88 --> 9558.759999999998
connections to another history that

9556.84 --> 9561.359
you're not informed about and that the

9558.76 --> 9561.359
rest of the book

9566.96 --> 9571.56
contradicts yeah whatever duper

9597.439 --> 9601.880000000001
don't know you're a little confused yeah

9599.359 --> 9605.24
I'm sure you are you get confused very

9601.88 --> 9605.24
easily the b

9606.2 --> 9613.560000000001
d i mean I don't know why you would be

9609.399 --> 9615.92
confused or perceive it in any form as a

9613.56 --> 9618.199999999999
contradiction somehow what I just said

9615.92 --> 9620.8
and what you repeated yeah but

9618.2 --> 9623.800000000001
apparently for you you that's

9620.8 --> 9623.8
incompatible

9626.64 --> 9631.96
somehow when you make contrad yeah

9629.52 --> 9634.560000000001
except I didn't make a

9631.96 --> 9638.039999999999
contradiction you're just desperate to

9634.56 --> 9638.039999999999
try to undermind me

9640.01 --> 9643.129
[Music]

9644.359 --> 9652.439
again oh really so gaining

9647.72 --> 9652.438999999998
wisdom clutch want to assist me in

9653.12 --> 9659.720000000001
that this [ __ ] over here says that

9656.04 --> 9662.880000000001
I'm contradicting something that I said

9659.72 --> 9665.438999999998
previously have I have I

9662.88 --> 9667.8
contradicted

9665.439 --> 9671.08
fundamental

9667.8 --> 9671.08
perspective of

9671.26 --> 9674.579
[Music]

9676.6 --> 9683.640000000001
this yeah debatable yeah I will because

9679.84 --> 9687.960000000001
I am right yeah you you can try to be

9683.64 --> 9689.88
all evasive and like want to be academic

9687.96 --> 9692.119999999999
about it you're not going to succeed I

9689.88 --> 9695.119999999999
know exactly what the [ __ ] it is that

9692.12 --> 9697.08
you do I know why you do it I know what

9695.12 --> 9701.68
you're doing and I know what why you're

9697.08 --> 9701.68
doing it what it's going to lead to

9704.24 --> 9710.88
yeah yeah I have not contradicted a

9707.399 --> 9714.119999999999
thing and there is no no contradictory

9710.88 --> 9718.399
contrast between what I'm saying

9714.12 --> 9721.08
now and between what I've said something

9718.399 --> 9723.08
in another stream concerning the same

9721.08 --> 9727.319
subject

9723.08 --> 9729.399
yeah so so you can seiz your

9727.319 --> 9732.278999999999
attempt to

9729.399 --> 9735.56
undermine my

9732.279 --> 9739.52
consistency with your false

9735.56 --> 9741.76
ridiculous claims here about what I've

9739.52 --> 9743.800000000001
said which you have not

9741.76 --> 9746.04
specified yeah and then you're just

9743.8 --> 9747.599999999999
stating oh I contradicted myself no I

9746.04 --> 9750.960000000001
did not contradict

9747.6 --> 9754.0
myself did I contradict myself

9750.96 --> 9756.358999999999
clearly I mean you've been there I've

9754.0 --> 9759.72
been rolling out the same position for

9756.359 --> 9762.359
like over a year years

9759.72 --> 9765.08
potentially I've definitely not

9762.359 --> 9767.279
contradicted anything with the

9765.08 --> 9772.08
statements that I've

9767.279 --> 9775.0
made with a a Pro previous revealing of

9772.08 --> 9775.0
my views on

9775.4 --> 9778.49
[Music]

9778.56 --> 9784.399
it yeah to me this is just debatable D

9781.68 --> 9787.800000000001
finding another desperate

9784.399 --> 9790.358999999999
attempt to try to undermine my logical

9787.8 --> 9792.319
consistency like he has to like declare

9790.359 --> 9795.0
that I'm crazy

9792.319 --> 9797.64
somehow like I'm not stable like I I

9795.0 --> 9800.399
don't really know what I'm talking about

9797.64 --> 9803.08
right it's the baller inside you just

9800.399 --> 9806.519999999999
have to chip at the foundations even if

9803.08 --> 9808.92
you have to lie for it lie like a

9806.52 --> 9808.92
[ __ ]

9809.319 --> 9815.278999999999
[ __ ] H debatable D you never said

9815.72 --> 9820.679999999998
that dude if I could if you were

9818.359 --> 9823.640000000001
literally on a mic you'd be stuttering

9820.68 --> 9825.800000000001
like a [ __ ] right

9823.64 --> 9829.8
now

9825.8 --> 9829.8
unbelievable pathetic

9850.52 --> 9855.720000000001
yeah so Ju Just imply right I mean oh

9853.8 --> 9857.759999999998
you're a little confused when you make

9855.72 --> 9859.92
contradictions what contradictions not

9857.76 --> 9861.479
mention oh yeah you're confused because

9859.92 --> 9863.72
you're not understanding my position

9861.479 --> 9866.278999999999
between what I said today and the

9863.72 --> 9868.8
previous stream even though you don't

9866.279 --> 9870.24
actually say what it is that I said and

9868.8 --> 9874.88
how it was different from what I'm

9870.24 --> 9877.84
saying now oh I'm Arwin is oh you're

9874.88 --> 9881.64
assuming my position oh really debatable

9877.84 --> 9883.8
D no no I'm not assuming your position

9881.64 --> 9886.72
it's the only position that could be

9883.8 --> 9889.56
interpreted from what you've

9886.72 --> 9891.24
said yeah a cont

9889.56 --> 9895.92
contentless

9891.24 --> 9899.279
referenceless accusation of

9895.92 --> 9902.0
contradiction yeah it's called

9899.279 --> 9906.399000000001
undermining like a

9902.0 --> 9906.399
[ __ ] without

9908.88 --> 9913.479
content you never said that but okay

9911.56 --> 9915.519999999999
yeah yeah yeah yeah except that's the

9913.479 --> 9917.679999999998
only way anybody could ever interpret

9915.52 --> 9922.319000000001
what you just

9917.68 --> 9922.319
said good did say what it was oh

9922.439 --> 9928.279
really in the previous you

9925.319 --> 9930.68
said the same thing is now about the

9928.279 --> 9932.560000000001
missing context and connection but you

9930.68 --> 9934.76
also said that we should listen to the

9932.56 --> 9937.0
words of Jesus did I say not to listen

9934.76 --> 9941.04
to the words of

9937.0 --> 9944.319
Jesus yeah are are you a [ __ ]

9941.04 --> 9946.279
liar could it be that you're a liar did

9944.319 --> 9950.039999999999
I did I say not to listen to the words

9946.279 --> 9951.76
of Jesus or did I say

9950.04 --> 9953.399000000001
that

9951.76 --> 9957.56
churchians

9953.399 --> 9961.358999999999
pans don't listen to the words of Jesus

9957.56 --> 9964.16
in favor of people that declare him a

9961.359 --> 9966.720000000001
God yeah because that's not my position

9964.16 --> 9970.319
I definitely say to listen to the words

9966.72 --> 9972.08
of Jesus so you just falsely accused me

9970.319 --> 9976.64
of something

9972.08 --> 9976.64
that came out of nowhere

9980.439 --> 9984.08
yeah we should we I said we should

9982.279 --> 9989.0
listen to the words of Jesus so when did

9984.08 --> 9992.08
I not say that yeah you bring up a

9989.0 --> 9996.12
contradiction supposedly as I just read

9992.08 --> 9998.8
it out what you said and oh no it's not

9996.12 --> 10001.880000000001
a contradiction are you having a little

9998.8 --> 10004.479
bit of a consistency problem there

10001.88 --> 10004.479
debatable

10005.0 --> 10011.359
D cuz this just starts to feel feel like

10009.279 --> 10015.16
you're just a couple of steps away from

10011.359 --> 10018.56
going into a psychotic break should keep

10015.16 --> 10018.56
flip-flopping your

10037.479 --> 10044.16
position yeah yeah you wrote you read

10040.84 --> 10045.68
wrote something out that he said then I

10044.16 --> 10048.319
said whoa there's like a lot of

10045.68 --> 10051.92
esoterics in there and explained like

10048.319 --> 10051.92
yeah there's bunch of whole stuff

10052.64 --> 10058.56
missing because of the

10055.08 --> 10062.72
context that's missing yeah does that

10058.56 --> 10065.319
mean don't listen to it does that mean

10062.72 --> 10068.358999999999
that or is it just you that's [ __ ]

10065.319 --> 10070.16
[ __ ] and somehow interpreting my

10068.359 --> 10071.720000000001
response of saying like oh what Jesus

10070.16 --> 10072.84
said there is really esoterical we're

10071.72 --> 10075.358999999999
missing

10072.84 --> 10077.8
context you interpret that as like oh

10075.359 --> 10079.800000000001
don't listen to him even though I

10077.8 --> 10081.96
clearly always say yeah definitely

10079.8 --> 10083.96
listen to him and just gave a little bit

10081.96 --> 10085.679999999998
more background information as to the

10083.96 --> 10088.88
angle of approach of what you're reading

10085.68 --> 10090.56
there but to you that means that I'm

10088.88 --> 10096.759999999998
contradicting

10090.56 --> 10100.08
myself yes of course debatable D

10096.76 --> 10102.319
no see where you can you see where the

10100.08 --> 10104.359
confusion comes from yeah I can see

10102.319 --> 10107.359
where the confusion comes from I just

10104.359 --> 10109.16
literally explained it to you but I bet

10107.359 --> 10110.960000000001
you're not listening to what I'm saying

10109.16 --> 10112.92
because you haven't been listening to

10110.96 --> 10114.16
what I'm saying ever since you roll out

10112.92 --> 10117.16
this

10114.16 --> 10117.16
ridiculous

10117.96 --> 10126.119999999999
accusation of being

10121.0 --> 10126.12
inconsistent which I have not been

10141.399 --> 10146.358999999999
yeah that's right clutch yeah that's

10143.84 --> 10149.12
right missing codes Priestly

10146.359 --> 10151.56
codes missing contacts Priestly codes

10149.12 --> 10157.08
yeah and when it comes to Priestly codes

10151.56 --> 10160.0
yeah that's not codes for the Catholic

10157.08 --> 10163.239
Church who wrote all this [ __ ] did all

10160.0 --> 10165.479
this yeah when I mean Priestly codes I

10163.239 --> 10167.68
mean the

10165.479 --> 10173.08
priesthood that

10167.68 --> 10177.479000000001
existed back then when Jesus was alive

10173.08 --> 10181.92
the real original Priestly codes which

10177.479 --> 10185.239
is not in the Bible yeah the missing

10181.92 --> 10188.960000000001
esoterics of the Priestly codes of

10185.239 --> 10194.479
Christ's actual time yeah that's what I

10188.96 --> 10197.358999999999
was referencing to yeah not the Catholic

10194.479 --> 10200.319
priesthood

10197.359 --> 10203.52
codes oh

10200.319 --> 10205.56
oh too difficult too difficult for you

10203.52 --> 10208.960000000001
to bable

10205.56 --> 10215.0
D was was that too complicated for you

10208.96 --> 10215.0
to logically conclude that out of what I

10217.279 --> 10223.16
said I guess you were kind of desperate

10221.04 --> 10225.0
to find some kind of flaws in my

10223.16 --> 10227.399
reasoning so you could claim that I

10225.0 --> 10230.52
contradicted myself because you are

10227.399 --> 10233.0
desperate you're desperate to see Arwin

10230.52 --> 10236.92
contradict himself oh my God you need to

10233.0 --> 10238.68
undermine that quickly right

10236.92 --> 10240.960000000001
quickly

10238.68 --> 10243.92
yes yeah I know what you're doing the

10240.96 --> 10244.88
bet d I know the game you're playing and

10243.92 --> 10250.64
I

10244.88 --> 10250.64
have swept it all from under your

10250.88 --> 10256.519999999999
feet no no and don't [ __ ] tell me

10254.479 --> 10259.72
what to do debatable

10256.52 --> 10261.960000000001
D it's all on screen everybody can see

10259.72 --> 10264.358999999999
what you've done what you're saying it's

10261.96 --> 10265.399
all on there so even if I kick you out

10264.359 --> 10268.479000000001
after

10265.399 --> 10273.199999999999
this they can still see what you

10268.479 --> 10273.199999999999
wrote then match it with what I've

10274.399 --> 10281.199999999999
said and then see that what I said about

10277.92 --> 10281.2
that is

10282.8 --> 10288.199999999999
correct yeah yeah I know clutch yeah he

10285.359 --> 10291.84
did get confused and then he

10288.2 --> 10294.239000000001
conveniently used that confusion to

10291.84 --> 10297.04
claim that I was contradicting myself

10294.239 --> 10300.119999999999
somehow with something I said previously

10297.04 --> 10302.12
oh what a convenient go-to position

10300.12 --> 10305.04
right when you're confused about what's

10302.12 --> 10307.960000000001
being discussed looks like somebody has

10305.04 --> 10311.12
their priorities set in a very specific

10307.96 --> 10314.839999999998
way yeah instead of oh maybe I should

10311.12 --> 10318.439
try to figure out what he said better oh

10314.84 --> 10320.52
no no no no no let's let's quickly dig

10318.439 --> 10322.6
and see if I can find some kind of

10320.52 --> 10327.439
undermining

10322.6 --> 10327.439
accusation huh debatable d

10334.4 --> 10337.6
[Music]

10343.92 --> 10350.479
yes yeah clutch yeah we should all just

10346.16 --> 10354.6
let it go and just reconsider just Blank

10350.479 --> 10358.119999999999
Slate it all and just like realize how

10354.6 --> 10360.92
unbelievably [ __ ] tedious it is to

10358.12 --> 10363.880000000001
listen to debatable de right now to the

10360.92 --> 10365.68
point where we're going to decide not to

10363.88 --> 10368.759999999998
think about it anymore because it's

10365.68 --> 10371.960000000001
literally a [ __ ] waste of our time to

10368.76 --> 10374.84
try to dig through this sickening cover

10371.96 --> 10377.358999999999
up of their own

10374.84 --> 10379.16
misbehavior all this effort just to

10377.359 --> 10381.279
cover up your

10379.16 --> 10384.52
own stupid

10381.279 --> 10387.960000000001
action yeah from your Vantage Point of

10384.52 --> 10390.359
confusion you just just happen stance

10387.96 --> 10393.8
happen to come to the conclusion that I

10390.359 --> 10396.56
might be contradicting myself oh yes

10393.8 --> 10399.399
yeah yeah it's so unbelievably [ __ ]

10396.56 --> 10401.399
tedious debatable D that I'm sure we're

10399.399 --> 10402.96
not going to take our time to think

10401.399 --> 10406.358999999999
about all of this

10402.96 --> 10409.479
again cuz we really just want to move

10406.359 --> 10411.92
on to be fair right clutch I mean I want

10409.479 --> 10414.119999999999
to move on but I mean this guy's just

10411.92 --> 10416.84
not going to shut the [ __ ] up about it

10414.12 --> 10419.0
after he embarrassed himself publicly

10416.84 --> 10422.279
like

10419.0 --> 10426.72
that yeah and got

10422.279 --> 10426.720000000001
analyzed to the Bone

10431.8 --> 10434.759999999998
all right

10440.239 --> 10445.439
anyhow debatable always does this [ __ ]

10443.319 --> 10448.8
by the way it's not like the first time

10445.439 --> 10448.800000000001
this is happening

10459.08 --> 10465.52
oh yes don't understand and then insult

10462.04 --> 10467.6
you no no I pointed out how you claimed

10465.52 --> 10470.239
that I was contradicting myself you were

10467.6 --> 10472.720000000001
just very confidently saying

10470.239 --> 10476.8
that

10472.72 --> 10479.199999999999
yeah you even elaborated upon my inquiry

10476.8 --> 10482.358999999999
about the accusation and then I pointed

10479.2 --> 10486.960000000001
out in detail how you were wrong and I'm

10482.359 --> 10490.720000000001
still pissed off at that that you do

10486.96 --> 10492.839999999998
that for no no damn reason yeah just

10490.72 --> 10494.08
insert oh he could contradicted himself

10492.84 --> 10497.52
no I

10494.08 --> 10502.6
didn't I absolutely did

10497.52 --> 10504.6
not and to interpret me contradicting

10502.6 --> 10506.52
myself requires some stretch of the

10504.6 --> 10509.52
imagination and some

10506.52 --> 10512.2
desperation some need for me to

10509.52 --> 10515.08
contradict myself right the need to

10512.2 --> 10516.92
interpret it like that yeah now that's

10515.08 --> 10520.72
definitely there debatable

10516.92 --> 10520.72
D and I'm on to

10520.76 --> 10528.239
you you can't get away with this [ __ ]

10524.359 --> 10530.880000000001
without being highlighted for it yeah

10528.239 --> 10533.88
you could grubel and worm your way out

10530.88 --> 10537.199999999999
of it and deny it and confuse the [ __ ]

10533.88 --> 10539.72
out of things or say oh I I didn't I

10537.2 --> 10540.76

10539.72 --> 10543.599999999999
or I

10540.76 --> 10545.84
just yeah yeah yeah yeah all the excuses

10543.6 --> 10548.84
ain't working yeah your spirit's very

10545.84 --> 10548.84
visible

10549.239 --> 10554.84
I know what you do debatable D I know

10551.96 --> 10557.919999999998
how you do it I've seen you do it and

10554.84 --> 10557.92
you're going to keep doing

10558.439 --> 10561.439
this

10561.76 --> 10568.479
yeah this is not a sock I'm not a socker

10564.88 --> 10572.479
account I'm not a puppet I'm not an

10568.479 --> 10576.399
Ballard Incognito at all really I'm a

10572.479 --> 10579.119999999999
real person damn it I have to just say

10576.399 --> 10583.8
it right because every person on the

10579.12 --> 10583.800000000001
internet has to say I'm a real

10586.04 --> 10591.92
person all

10588.08 --> 10596.16
right okay so now that this is

10591.92 --> 10599.68
all there I'm going to run out the show

10596.16 --> 10601.399
because I'm sick of you it would be

10599.68 --> 10604.960000000001
great if YouTube had some function where

10601.399 --> 10607.278999999999
you could just like shut him the [ __ ] up

10604.96 --> 10609.96
without deleting everything that he said

10607.279 --> 10611.92
but hey YouTube do doesn't have that

10609.96 --> 10614.88
doesn't have that you can't just shut

10611.92 --> 10617.68
somebody the [ __ ] up without deleting

10614.88 --> 10620.0
all the [ __ ] from the chat and that's

10617.68 --> 10620.0
very

10620.52 --> 10628.960000000001
annoying yeah would be extremely helpful

10623.88 --> 10628.96
if YouTube had that very specific

10629.359 --> 10636.52
function right enjoyed it I'm glad you

10632.52 --> 10639.399000000001
enjoyed it it was good to just get real

10636.52 --> 10642.76
and to point out these wormy behavior

10639.399 --> 10645.278999999999
from people and be right about it and

10642.76 --> 10648.2
then see them worm even

10645.279 --> 10651.92
more that's all just fine because I know

10648.2 --> 10656.279
what I'm talking about and I'm very

10651.92 --> 10660.319
consistent very very consistent with

10656.279 --> 10663.04
what I talk about have been for years

10660.319 --> 10667.0
yeah if there even is some kind of

10663.04 --> 10669.880000000001
alteration in it then I'm very aware of

10667.0 --> 10674.76
that alteration it can even tell you

10669.88 --> 10680.56
when the alteration of my view occurred

10674.76 --> 10684.319
and why yeah cuz I'm not inconsistent I

10680.56 --> 10685.6
don't one day say one thing and then the

10684.319 --> 10688.399
next

10685.6 --> 10691.279
day say something different that

10688.399 --> 10696.119999999999
contrasts what I said before

10691.279 --> 10698.960000000001
without actually saying so or mentioning

10696.12 --> 10703.52
why or anything yeah

10698.96 --> 10706.96
I am extremely consistent you can stop

10703.52 --> 10709.6
trying to undermine me with that okay
