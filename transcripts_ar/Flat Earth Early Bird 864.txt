so

82.02 --> 87.78
whether today

84.54 --> 89.57900000000001
very similar to yesterday

87.78 --> 90.84
very similar

89.579 --> 92.39999999999999
except

90.84 --> 95.46000000000001
yeah there's

92.4 --> 98.119
a nice bit of sun right now look at that

95.46 --> 98.119
oh

99.06 --> 104.06
I got a good blue spot right now

104.1 --> 108.38
so

105.6 --> 108.38
hopefully

108.479 --> 113.64
that's gonna last longer than

110.88 --> 117.16
two minutes as there is some kind of

113.64 --> 118.56
cloud Bank coming from over there

117.16 --> 120.899
[Music]

118.56 --> 122.46000000000001
but yeah it's nice to have this sun if

120.899 --> 125.34
it's gonna get cold I'm just gonna put

122.46 --> 128.0
my sweater back on

125.34 --> 128.0
ah

129.479 --> 140.09900000000002
right so it's Thursday the fifth

133.62 --> 140.09900000000002
Thursday the 15th of April 2021

143.58 --> 147.8
hello Tom Parker first in chat

148.7 --> 157.319
C Endo Indo t

153.0 --> 159.56
hello welcome to the chat sun is near oh

157.319 --> 159.56
really

162.06 --> 167.099
I don't think the sun is in any literal

164.16 --> 171.2
position it's just an apparition anyway

167.099 --> 171.2
hello Tara 306

172.44 --> 176.35999999999999
right so today

176.879 --> 182.51899999999998
I'm gonna try

179.94 --> 184.76
to not get as pissed off as I did

182.519 --> 184.76000000000002
yesterday

186.18 --> 193.14000000000001
man I was so livid

190.2 --> 195.48
it was unhealthy

193.14 --> 199.379
and I had a whole lot of toothaches too

195.48 --> 201.35999999999999
like I bit like again

199.379 --> 203.94
on that so

201.36 --> 207.0
but it does go away again so it's not

203.94 --> 210.659
something that's permanent I saw

207.0 --> 213.239
I have to attribute it to I guess

210.659 --> 216.42
recklessness

213.239 --> 220.799
ties in with forms of mania which are

216.42 --> 223.67999999999998
probably triggered by compacted stress

220.799 --> 227.22
of from everything

223.68 --> 229.31900000000002
that is trying to find a way out

227.22 --> 231.959
while at the same time I'm in a position

229.319 --> 235.01899999999998
where I have to stay perfectly calm as

231.959 --> 237.659
many times as possible because otherwise

235.019 --> 241.799
I'll be kicked out of my house

237.659 --> 245.72
sort of indirectly so yeah

241.799 --> 245.72
maybe that explains a little

249.18 --> 253.019
some things you just can't really Escape

251.22 --> 254.939
but

253.019 --> 257.459
a very rough

254.939 --> 260.82
day yesterday overall

257.459 --> 263.699
a lot of frustrations in the night I

260.82 --> 267.96
felt when I was going to sleep I had a

263.699 --> 271.44
moment where I was absolutely miserable

267.96 --> 274.75899999999996
it's like my entire life

271.44 --> 274.759
came rolling past

275.699 --> 280.40000000000003
and

276.84 --> 280.4
[Music]

282.54 --> 289.91900000000004
yeah not a lot of good things I had

286.02 --> 293.78
feeling about that but I was basically

289.919 --> 293.78
so frustrated I

295.139 --> 299.88
I yeah I kind of like what I do

297.66 --> 301.62
sometimes here diving into the deep I

299.88 --> 305.15999999999997
did it on myself

301.62 --> 308.52
got back there and it's just

305.16 --> 312.24
it's bizarre it's very bizarre because

308.52 --> 315.24
as I was doing it gazing as how I was

312.24 --> 317.639
and like being really honest about it

315.24 --> 320.34000000000003
right because I am the way I am right

317.639 --> 321.96000000000004
now right now in this time

320.34 --> 324.78
but back then

321.96 --> 327.419
it's intenable and it's so weird

324.78 --> 328.79999999999995
because even during those times I had

327.419 --> 332.21999999999997
distinct

328.8 --> 336.32
signals signals like really from the

332.22 --> 336.32000000000005
inside that were mystical to me

336.419 --> 343.68
where I felt

339.3 --> 345.18
like I was being punished

343.68 --> 347.94
and maybe

345.18 --> 351.979
maybe that was

347.94 --> 351.979
me from now

352.8 --> 359.22
and it does feel that like

356.1 --> 362.699
a lot of the the frustrations and anger

359.22 --> 364.88000000000005
towards myself and frustration with the

362.699 --> 364.88
world

364.919 --> 370.62
I'm angry at myself for basically

367.38 --> 374.88
getting myself into this position

370.62 --> 377.22
for tactical and very untactical choices

374.88 --> 380.039
for my own life development

377.22 --> 383.03900000000004
and then i gaze back

380.039 --> 386.09999999999997
is back to how I was how I thought how I

383.039 --> 388.86
felt how I prioritized

386.1 --> 391.639
and it's also been

388.86 --> 391.639
like a

397.919 --> 403.919
like nobody stood up against

401.34 --> 406.61999999999995
what I was engaging in

403.919 --> 409.25899999999996
nobody did anything it's oh and I

406.62 --> 411.24
remember this sensation and I completely

409.259 --> 413.819
flipped it around

411.24 --> 416.819
because I interpreted back then that

413.819 --> 419.94
nobody was resisting me with their all

416.819 --> 422.28000000000003
too weak so I have to do this even

419.94 --> 425.4
though it doesn't make any sense really

422.28 --> 429.25899999999996
in a bigger picture although I kind of

425.4 --> 431.69899999999996
threw magical thinking and

429.259 --> 433.88
how you explain this

431.699 --> 433.88
foreign

436.34 --> 439.919
thought that

438.3 --> 442.38
basically

439.919 --> 445.44
making that mistake

442.38 --> 448.199
would somehow benefit me

445.44 --> 449.88
and it's tough because yes technically

448.199 --> 453.06
there is always some kind of benefit

449.88 --> 456.56
from a mistaker when you learn from it

453.06 --> 456.56
but sometimes

458.099 --> 463.139
where when you're warned and you don't

460.44 --> 465.84
take it

463.139 --> 467.879
for whatever reason because you might

465.84 --> 470.039
feel you don't have enough options left

467.879 --> 473.09900000000005
right what I did is

470.039 --> 476.28
back then I didn't trust this I didn't

473.099 --> 479.759
trust the Purity I didn't trust that God

476.28 --> 482.099
would yield I mistook purity

479.759 --> 485.58000000000004
for

482.099 --> 488.099
it was out of whack just my frequency it

485.58 --> 492.12
was out of whack and kind of the world

488.099 --> 495.12
did that to me in a way and I even like

492.12 --> 499.139
felt it like I grieved about that that

495.12 --> 502.28000000000003
was happening to me and literally nobody

499.139 --> 505.62
send me a sign that they even understood

502.28 --> 508.5
and eventually it ended up that people

505.62 --> 510.66
even close to me would just considered

508.5 --> 512.219
me insane

510.66 --> 515.519
yeah

512.219 --> 519.86
even compounding basically the

515.519 --> 519.86
inward spiral gaslighting effect

524.399 --> 530.12
so yeah in most ways I kept only myself

527.399 --> 530.12
to blame

531.12 --> 535.68
it's just that

532.86 --> 536.4590000000001
I'm having a lot of hard times accepting

535.68 --> 539.519
it

536.459 --> 541.0799999999999
and even that in acceptance is also

539.519 --> 542.4590000000001
getting in the way

541.08 --> 544.9200000000001
of

542.459 --> 548.459
moving on

544.92 --> 551.9399999999999
because rage and frustration is really

548.459 --> 555.18
not good it's like very much in the way

551.94 --> 557.22
for anything I'm gonna try to engage out

555.18 --> 559.1999999999999
there because it's gonna I'm gonna bump

557.22 --> 561.0
into that [ __ ]

559.2 --> 563.519
the problem is

561.0 --> 565.74
I don't know anything I can do about it

563.519 --> 569.6
and I'm even trying to puzzle out like

565.74 --> 569.6
what could have I have done in the past

570.92 --> 576.779
to not

574.019 --> 578.04
let it get that far

576.779 --> 581.7
without

578.04 --> 583.1999999999999
breaking or maybe I was just completely

581.7 --> 585.4200000000001
wrong

583.2 --> 588.48
and it's the fear

585.42 --> 590.76
of breaking in certain elements

588.48 --> 594.1800000000001
because not in not

590.76 --> 597.42
not in like the subtle Spirit things

594.18 --> 598.3199999999999
right not in just like feelings of guilt

597.42 --> 600.7199999999999
like

598.32 --> 605.0400000000001
never should never get rid of that

600.72 --> 607.38
completely like and people would oh so

605.04 --> 610.3199999999999
[ __ ] up

607.38 --> 613.16
people would literally tell me

610.32 --> 613.1600000000001
to do that

615.779 --> 623.1
it's like I'm in a Quantum puzzle

619.079 --> 626.279
I'm now at one side of the puzzle

623.1 --> 628.5
I need the other side but it because I

626.279 --> 632.82
need the other side

628.5 --> 634.92
or rather if I take in the other side

632.82 --> 636.48
then I would have never

634.92 --> 638.8389999999999
known

636.48 --> 644.399
it wouldn't have mattered

638.839 --> 644.399
it's an impossible puzzle guys

647.579 --> 650.779
it's impossible

652.44 --> 658.3800000000001
like

654.839 --> 661.86
because they it would have been getting

658.38 --> 665.16
good at going along to get along

661.86 --> 668.22
and that would have potentially made me

665.16 --> 670.079
Gaslight myself eventually up to the

668.22 --> 671.76
point where I would take the [ __ ]

670.079 --> 673.3199999999999
vaccine

671.76 --> 674.9399999999999
just

673.32 --> 678.36
to

674.94 --> 680.1600000000001
try to dispel the fear on it even if it

678.36 --> 682.44
would have consequences that sort of

680.16 --> 686.3389999999999
[ __ ] up [ __ ] like I would have

682.44 --> 688.7
freaking went there if I if I changed

686.339 --> 688.7
all this

689.16 --> 696.959
so even if theoretically somehow

692.579 --> 699.0
I could have I could like take go in the

696.959 --> 700.9799999999999
other dimension and kind of like do a

699.0 --> 702.6
switch around or something if that were

700.98 --> 705.12
possible and

702.6 --> 706.32
I don't know man with what I have

705.12 --> 709.079
experienced

706.32 --> 711.779
I've experienced some really weird [ __ ]

709.079 --> 713.76
so maybe even that has already happened

711.779 --> 717.079
in ways

713.76 --> 717.079
it's just that

718.5 --> 724.019
you can't really tell from a third

721.8 --> 727.3199999999999
dimensional perspective

724.019 --> 729.92
because it doesn't happen there

727.32 --> 729.9200000000001
ugh

736.56 --> 742.1999999999999
so

738.36 --> 746.04
now I'm just sitting here

742.2 --> 749.399
wondering how do I move on do I have to

746.04 --> 751.3199999999999
like is there nothing left is it really

749.399 --> 754.68
gone

751.32 --> 757.9200000000001
because of everything that I've done the

754.68 --> 760.019
time if I miss chances of chances and

757.92 --> 762.18
now there's little chances like I don't

760.019 --> 764.839
know what to do anymore guys like I'm

762.18 --> 764.8389999999999
again in

772.44 --> 777.9200000000001
I mean I will just keep on doing this

777.959 --> 784.0189999999999
during the cosmogeny right it's like to

781.86 --> 786.1800000000001
me the cause marginally the discoveries

784.019 --> 790.139
within it

786.18 --> 794.9399999999999
it's literally to me the only pure thing

790.139 --> 797.82
the only thing that I'm actually really

794.94 --> 799.8000000000001
proud of that I don't want to lose it's

797.82 --> 804.139
the only thing

799.8 --> 804.139
because everything else is just so

810.32 --> 816.24
disappointing and not what I expected

814.44 --> 819.24
and

816.24 --> 822.0600000000001
a lot of things that I think seem good

819.24 --> 824.82
about me are just fluff

822.06 --> 827.6389999999999
it doesn't really matter it's

824.82 --> 831.3000000000001
like if the tides change I change like

827.639 --> 833.699
what does it matter how good I can be in

831.3 --> 834.959
a position of weakness what does it

833.699 --> 836.9399999999999
matter

834.959 --> 841.38
because I do feel like I'm in a position

836.94 --> 844.3800000000001
of weakness in almost everything except

841.38 --> 844.38
cosmoginy

845.399 --> 852.54
except in that that intellectual

849.26 --> 855.72
spiritual path on trying to figure out

852.54 --> 857.639
the truth and holding on to it in like a

855.72 --> 860.48
esoteric battle

857.639 --> 860.48
with everything

872.579 --> 877.68
right but hello by the way Ralph

875.519 --> 882.48
Rodriguez Nathan Oakley

877.68 --> 885.0
1980 good to see you both Stars Moretz

882.48 --> 887.279
take it easy Arwin

885.0 --> 890.279
take what easy

887.279 --> 892.92
I'm sorry am I am I coming off a little

890.279 --> 895.639
too aggressive right now

892.92 --> 895.639
I'm sorry

895.8 --> 903.3
or is this little too intense

899.639 --> 905.88
maybe maybe should be talking about just

903.3 --> 907.62
oh look at the nice Birds and the fluffy

905.88 --> 911.9399999999999
clouds

907.62 --> 915.5600000000001
everything's all right don't worry

911.94 --> 915.5600000000001
everything will be all right

917.22 --> 923.339
except it's just provably a nightmare is

920.639 --> 927.62
unfolding that's gonna do so much damage

923.339 --> 927.62
it's gonna destroy so much that is good

928.079 --> 931.7399999999999
like what do you think that the mask

930.42 --> 933.42
[ __ ]

931.74 --> 939.779
and the covet

933.42 --> 941.639
fakeness is it's just the start the

939.779 --> 942.6
start you know what's gonna happen in

941.639 --> 943.74
the future

942.6 --> 946.62
right

943.74 --> 950.82
learned something we know we know that

946.62 --> 953.699
Bill Gates bought up massive amounts of

950.82 --> 957.6
land in the U.S you know he now there

953.699 --> 960.0
it's it's public now he's gonna use it

957.6 --> 963.019
for GMO crops

960.0 --> 965.339
all of that right so it's going to be

963.019 --> 969.839
the most

965.339 --> 972.839
GMO farming the United States has ever

969.839 --> 975.1800000000001
seen thanks to Bill Gates

972.839 --> 977.72
yeah yeah

975.18 --> 981.2399999999999
things that I said about him

977.72 --> 982.1990000000001
absolutely stand more more than you can

981.24 --> 983.5790000000001
imagine

982.199 --> 987.18
because you know what's gonna happen

983.579 --> 988.3199999999999
with that that food that that biofuel

987.18 --> 991.2589999999999
right

988.32 --> 993.6600000000001
that's gonna be weaponized food

991.259 --> 995.639
you think that's just gonna be biofuel

993.66 --> 997.5
no no no

995.639 --> 1000.5600000000001
what's gonna do

997.5 --> 1002.72
create a huge pile of them

1000.56 --> 1006.4399999999999
food

1002.72 --> 1008.1800000000001
right food that cannot cannot rot

1006.44 --> 1010.2790000000001
probably it'll stay like that forever

1008.18 --> 1014.0
and then

1010.279 --> 1018.38
then at some point deliberately they're

1014.0 --> 1022.459
going to try to use the geopolitical

1018.38 --> 1023.899
system to completely block food

1022.459 --> 1026.539
production

1023.899 --> 1028.28
right until there will be sure this is

1026.539 --> 1032.6
guess what's going to happen all that

1028.28 --> 1034.28
extra GMO food it's going to be

1032.6 --> 1038.9589999999998
forced

1034.28 --> 1040.939
forced on the world like people will

1038.959 --> 1044.0
through blackmail

1040.939 --> 1047.78
and sabotage of international trade

1044.0 --> 1049.82
going to be forced to eat that [ __ ]

1047.78 --> 1053.0
yeah

1049.82 --> 1056.299
oh first of all it's going to be

1053.0 --> 1058.96
really difficult to get away from it

1056.299 --> 1061.7
because of what's about to happen right

1058.96 --> 1063.799
every rule you're taking for granted

1061.7 --> 1066.8600000000001
every rule that's in place that's just

1063.799 --> 1068.84
logical right every single rule it's all

1066.86 --> 1071.9599999999998
gonna go away

1068.84 --> 1074.559
you you think it's a neofutable system

1071.96 --> 1074.559
right now

1075.08 --> 1078.799
it's going to be

1077.36 --> 1082.9399999999998
yond

1078.799 --> 1085.22
description if you think 1984 is bad

1082.94 --> 1087.5800000000002
it's going to be so much worse that

1085.22 --> 1090.5
nobody will even want to write it down

1087.58 --> 1092.539
nobody will even want to make a

1090.5 --> 1096.2
fictional thing about it because it's so

1092.539 --> 1098.299
terrible it defies the imagination it

1096.2 --> 1099.6200000000001
defies senses

1098.299 --> 1101.26
yeah

1099.62 --> 1104.12
why

1101.26 --> 1105.98
is this continuing

1104.12 --> 1109.82
why

1105.98 --> 1112.48
why isn't this stopped permanently

1109.82 --> 1116.72
why are people

1112.48 --> 1119.0
demanding absolute Doom right

1116.72 --> 1122.059
like there should be just fights

1119.0 --> 1125.059
breaking out in the streets like brutal

1122.059 --> 1129.62
over the [ __ ] mind control to get

1125.059 --> 1132.44
that Spirit of surrender to Satan out

1129.62 --> 1134.1789999999999
like I'm I'm like on the point of just

1132.44 --> 1138.26
calling

1134.179 --> 1141.14
like everything calling an Inquisition

1138.26 --> 1145.34
calling a crusade calling it Jihad

1141.14 --> 1148.5200000000002
calling all of it all of the religions

1145.34 --> 1151.52
we need to purge this

1148.52 --> 1151.52
radically

1152.0 --> 1158.24
no mercy

1153.98 --> 1161.2
it needs to be purged all of it

1158.24 --> 1161.2
quickly

1162.44 --> 1169.72
why is everybody surrendering why

1165.98 --> 1169.72
why do people do this

1175.94 --> 1179.3200000000002
yes steamy traveler it does have all our

1178.52 --> 1182.539
information

1179.32 --> 1184.84
everybody on the top has all of our

1182.539 --> 1184.84
information

1185.059 --> 1191.6
you don't there are so many sources

1188.9 --> 1195.0800000000002
so many slips through

1191.6 --> 1196.039
everybody has everybody's information up

1195.08 --> 1198.6789999999999
there

1196.039 --> 1201.5
everybody's information

1198.679 --> 1203.24
it's not windows it's everything

1201.5 --> 1205.52
everything

1203.24 --> 1208.24
There Is No Escape

1205.52 --> 1213.039
Right There Is No Escape

1208.24 --> 1213.039
confrontation or die

1213.14 --> 1220.72
that's the options confrontation or die

1217.64 --> 1220.72
that's the option

1223.88 --> 1229.4
there's no waiting

1226.64 --> 1231.5
waiting is not an option

1229.4 --> 1234.38
it's a slope

1231.5 --> 1237.039
and we're rolling right towards the

1234.38 --> 1239.419
abyss it's not going to stop rolling

1237.039 --> 1241.28
especially if your weight is going to

1239.419 --> 1243.26
accelerate only

1241.28 --> 1245.4189999999999
it has to be stopped

1243.26 --> 1248.419
waiting

1245.419 --> 1252.0200000000002
is not going to stop it

1248.419 --> 1254.8400000000001
we can't get stuck in Little Things

1252.02 --> 1257.6589999999999
anymore Little Things

1254.84 --> 1260.1789999999999
right small fights

1257.659 --> 1262.7
staking up for principles yeah it's also

1260.179 --> 1265.64
good it it strengthens it helps it

1262.7 --> 1267.159
secures it's not going to stop it's only

1265.64 --> 1271.2800000000002
going to get worse

1267.159 --> 1275.72
radical action radical like unlike we've

1271.28 --> 1279.32
ever seen all this media crap everywhere

1275.72 --> 1282.74
and even the fake Wars and [ __ ]

1279.32 --> 1285.34
crazy Opera that's that's nothing that's

1282.74 --> 1285.34
nothing

1288.02 --> 1291.8799999999999
it's all a stage Act

1294.38 --> 1298.5390000000002
radical action is required

1299.36 --> 1308.12
like like breaking and disposing of this

1305.059 --> 1310.96
Narrative of the Beast narrative it must

1308.12 --> 1310.9599999999998
stop

1314.62 --> 1320.4799999999998
it just the Beast needs a muzzle really

1318.919 --> 1322.76
quickly

1320.48 --> 1327.64
because it's going to tear up everything

1322.76 --> 1327.64
so bad there's no recovery

1328.28 --> 1333.62
we don't even have oversight about the

1331.7 --> 1336.98
damage that's going to be caused because

1333.62 --> 1340.9399999999998
the the share preponderance of all of it

1336.98 --> 1343.159
is too much for a person to get in their

1340.94 --> 1347.2
mind

1343.159 --> 1347.2
it's not a matter if

1348.02 --> 1354.86
it's not that's not the question it's

1350.48 --> 1358.64
not the question if yeah it is now what

1354.86 --> 1362.36
now what do we do how do we stop this

1358.64 --> 1365.6000000000001
like really stop this not just defend

1362.36 --> 1368.7199999999998
against it stop it how do we stop it

1365.6 --> 1370.76
defending against it will mean it will

1368.72 --> 1373.22
win

1370.76 --> 1375.919
we must stop it

1373.22 --> 1378.52
stop them

1375.919 --> 1378.5200000000002
like

1383.08 --> 1390.1399999999999
convincing people is just the time is

1386.6 --> 1391.1
over the time is over there is no more

1390.14 --> 1393.38
time

1391.1 --> 1395.36
to wake up people

1393.38 --> 1397.7
that are stuck in the Beast that have

1395.36 --> 1399.1399999999999
become surrenderists there's no more

1397.7 --> 1404.6200000000001
time

1399.14 --> 1404.6200000000001
there needs to be made radical moves

1407.36 --> 1413.1789999999999
and that's going to basically black ball

1410.299 --> 1415.34
a whole bunch of places there's already

1413.179 --> 1417.26
by the way places that are kind of being

1415.34 --> 1419.1789999999999
blackballed

1417.26 --> 1421.1589999999999
through media and you just don't really

1419.179 --> 1423.0800000000002
hear of them well those are the the

1421.159 --> 1425.24
better places where the fights are

1423.08 --> 1428.48
probably heavier

1425.24 --> 1430.7
but also the Purity is heavier and you

1428.48 --> 1432.679
don't get to hear about it that needs to

1430.7 --> 1438.26
be everywhere that needs to be

1432.679 --> 1441.02
everywhere until a completely new

1438.26 --> 1444.46
media

1441.02 --> 1447.94
spirit re-emerges and not some

1444.46 --> 1451.94
Corporation narrative not this stupid

1447.94 --> 1454.94
new right [ __ ] which is completely

1451.94 --> 1456.02
contaminated with lies as well

1454.94 --> 1460.1200000000001
right

1456.02 --> 1460.12
it has to be something really

1462.02 --> 1466.36
strong and pure somehow

1468.919 --> 1476.2990000000002
like quickly adapting

1472.94 --> 1477.5
I it's it's hard I don't know exactly

1476.299 --> 1478.9
what

1477.5 --> 1481.58
like

1478.9 --> 1484.94
in that sense like there is

1481.58 --> 1488.1399999999999
I think sometimes like this Beast system

1484.94 --> 1490.7
was specifically designed

1488.14 --> 1492.74
multi-generational to

1490.7 --> 1496.46
Force

1492.74 --> 1498.38
a correct a correcting world government

1496.46 --> 1499.88
because I don't know how else it could

1498.38 --> 1502.179
be done I don't want the world

1499.88 --> 1502.179
government

1502.22 --> 1509.0
but how else right it because this is

1505.64 --> 1510.919
like the yeah like in Star this is kind

1509.0 --> 1514.72
of right in the middle

1510.919 --> 1514.72
of the Empire moment

1517.159 --> 1521.659
right so how do we

1519.44 --> 1523.3400000000001
make that happen without

1521.659 --> 1527.5
the Sith

1523.34 --> 1527.5
taking the Helm of the empire

1527.6 --> 1533.4399999999998
can we avoid that it's kind of like at

1530.48 --> 1533.44
the helm right now

1535.76 --> 1544.6589999999999
but how do you get rid of it like yeah I

1540.44 --> 1544.659
don't even know if if the Star Wars

1544.779 --> 1552.08
Saga is a is a realistic comparison like

1549.38 --> 1554.779
in some ways it is

1552.08 --> 1557.8999999999999
because yeah after that

1554.779 --> 1559.7
like you know like well with the new

1557.9 --> 1561.3200000000002
series they made the new movies they

1559.7 --> 1563.059
made in which that's been highly

1561.32 --> 1566.48
criticized

1563.059 --> 1569.72
like so much goes wrong

1566.48 --> 1572.299
all the freaking new death stars and all

1569.72 --> 1577.299
the planets being blown up just

1572.299 --> 1577.299
endless destruction and for what

1577.4 --> 1583.64
because when yeah in a peak society when

1581.299 --> 1588.039
there's just a lot of people a lot of

1583.64 --> 1588.039
confusion very easily misled all

2353.7 --> 2359.5789999999997
all right yeah sorry for the

2356.56 --> 2359.5789999999997
intermission guys

2359.859 --> 2363.24
was highly needed

2363.7 --> 2366.06
ah

2368.56 --> 2372.94
because yeah

2370.48 --> 2375.22
like I've basically just discussed with

2372.94 --> 2379.06
him what I roughly discussed with you

2375.22 --> 2382.839
very quickly and then he looked because

2379.06 --> 2385.359
the guy has enough input by himself to

2382.839 --> 2388.06
be a YouTube channel it's just that he's

2385.359 --> 2390.8199999999997
not actually doing that

2388.06 --> 2394.5
because of the

2390.82 --> 2398.2000000000003
extra waste that comes over you

2394.5 --> 2401.38
spiritual waste because of people highly

2398.2 --> 2402.5789999999997
possessed by ariman Lucifer throwing it

2401.38 --> 2404.079
out there

2402.579 --> 2406.1800000000003
right but that's by the way not

2404.079 --> 2408.52
exclusive to like YouTube or something

2406.18 --> 2410.56
it's with everything it's even when you

2408.52 --> 2412.24
read a newspaper the energy of the

2410.56 --> 2414.099
writer

2412.24 --> 2416.6189999999997
if they are possessed if they are

2414.099 --> 2419.44
echoing something it happens too and

2416.619 --> 2422.339
apparently the source of my grease grief

2419.44 --> 2422.339
was just that

2422.38 --> 2426.4
foreign

2424.42 --> 2428.26
remember yesterday that I mentioned

2426.4 --> 2431.26
reading something in a newspaper and

2428.26 --> 2433.78
then basically going berserk well yeah

2431.26 --> 2435.76
it was just that it was something that I

2433.78 --> 2438.099
read in a newspaper that I don't

2435.76 --> 2439.0600000000004
typically pick up on it's not

2438.099 --> 2441.339
like

2439.06 --> 2445.359
yeah somebody here in the house

2441.339 --> 2448.42
apparently got that red dead and it was

2445.359 --> 2451.9
like the way it was phrased was horrific

2448.42 --> 2455.46
it was like liberal Democrat United

2451.9 --> 2460.2400000000002
States level of horrific

2455.46 --> 2462.76
total Evil Total evil like literally

2460.24 --> 2464.4399999999996
trying to make you guess like in that

2462.76 --> 2465.6400000000003
you have to force everyone to take

2464.44 --> 2467.079
vaccines

2465.64 --> 2469.06
like

2467.079 --> 2471.819
really bad

2469.06 --> 2475.7799999999997
and that the spirit of that kind of

2471.819 --> 2478.66
lashed out to me and stuck

2475.78 --> 2481.3590000000004
and have been kind of haunted by that

2478.66 --> 2484.839
including it last night where I was yeah

2481.359 --> 2487.9
full of grief like really bad

2484.839 --> 2491.4
was really like crying out

2487.9 --> 2491.4
pain of my life

2492.04 --> 2497.079
in yeah we've covered my face by the way

2495.28 --> 2501.119
I don't think I kept and everybody

2497.079 --> 2501.119
anybody awoke with that thank God

2502.839 --> 2511.42
but yeah he did his thing and it was

2505.839 --> 2513.7
good I feel a lot more tranquil now

2511.42 --> 2515.619
but also yeah

2513.7 --> 2518.9399999999996
the guy is busy

2515.619 --> 2522.819
he's like he has 300 percent

2518.94 --> 2524.44
activity now because guess what I'm not

2522.819 --> 2527.68
the only one

2524.44 --> 2529.359
right the wheel the world is just filled

2527.68 --> 2532.66
now with people

2529.359 --> 2534.42
that are getting just over exposed by

2532.66 --> 2537.2799999999997
like Supreme

2534.42 --> 2539.7400000000002
arimanian influence like there it's like

2537.28 --> 2540.8190000000004
manifesting almost like a spirit on its

2539.74 --> 2543.3999999999996
own

2540.819 --> 2546.42
like the corona death Spirit the spirit

2543.4 --> 2546.42
of the LIE

2546.52 --> 2553.3
trying to

2548.619 --> 2557.92
railroad you into a slaughterhouse

2553.3 --> 2560.76
it's really bad and yeah he also has the

2557.92 --> 2564.2200000000003
impact of that through yeah people

2560.76 --> 2566.94
calling him up a lot more

2564.22 --> 2566.9399999999996
ah

2567.54 --> 2575.099
right anyway sorry for for that what is

2571.54 --> 2575.099
it 10 minute absence

2579.339 --> 2584.74
right but also he had dude he has some

2582.4 --> 2587.619
surprising things to say to me like

2584.74 --> 2590.3799999999997
really surprising

2587.619 --> 2595.0
like things that he will just State and

2590.38 --> 2597.099
it's not like he read up on it on the

2595.0 --> 2600.339
internet somewhere or heard through some

2597.099 --> 2601.96
no he just gets it through his guides

2600.339 --> 2604.839
kind of like

2601.96 --> 2608.2
what I tried to do

2604.839 --> 2610.119
but yeah he's very trained at it like

2608.2 --> 2612.5789999999997
very very trained

2610.119 --> 2615.579
and he'll just say like no this person

2612.579 --> 2617.02
is not dead or this person is alive

2615.579 --> 2620.2000000000003
just like that

2617.02 --> 2622.98
and like yeah yeah it's pretty

2620.2 --> 2622.98
mysterious

2623.92 --> 2633.16
but I can't my feelings my senses like

2629.68 --> 2636.0989999999997
like it's not lying like he

2633.16 --> 2638.98
is getting that sign he's getting that

2636.099 --> 2642.579
information it's just

2638.98 --> 2645.52
I'm kind of marveling at at the ease

2642.579 --> 2647.8590000000004
with which he does it and how relatively

2645.52 --> 2650.74
unaffected he is like

2647.859 --> 2653.44
he's sensitive but

2650.74 --> 2655.9599999999996
probably as sensitive as me but he's

2653.44 --> 2659.099
older than me probably like 30 years old

2655.96 --> 2661.839
or somewhere and

2659.099 --> 2665.02
very good at just

2661.839 --> 2668.5
not being influenced by it at all by the

2665.02 --> 2672.339
darkness like seeing what it is and not

2668.5 --> 2676.06
not being affected by it in person even

2672.339 --> 2680.2599999999998
though still being that limited person

2676.06 --> 2684.099
in a way it's pretty remarkable

2680.26 --> 2687.6400000000003
I really look up to the guy like that

2684.099 --> 2689.8
and he he brought me Rudolph Steiner he

2687.64 --> 2692.7999999999997
brought it back in my life

2689.8 --> 2695.26
and he's also very fluent at German new

2692.8 --> 2698.2000000000003
medicine so in many ways he is kind of

2695.26 --> 2700.9
like my my teacher

2698.2 --> 2704.339
and he knows it and he's extremely

2700.9 --> 2707.319
gracious and and merciful to me because

2704.339 --> 2710.38
I don't pay him

2707.319 --> 2714.04
he's just giving me that service

2710.38 --> 2715.96
apparently that yields some spiritual

2714.04 --> 2717.94
reward

2715.96 --> 2720.099
although I tried to pay him sometimes

2717.94 --> 2722.2000000000003
because I just like when I'm doing good

2720.099 --> 2724.599
and it's not that often

2722.2 --> 2726.5789999999997
I really feel guilty it's like no but

2724.599 --> 2727.3
I'm doing better so I have to give you

2726.579 --> 2730.8
some

2727.3 --> 2730.8
and he gets that

2734.619 --> 2739.5
have I ever seen a ghost

2736.78 --> 2739.5
yes

2743.8 --> 2750.46
I saw I saw my mother's ghost

2747.579 --> 2753.119
the night that she died before I knew

2750.46 --> 2753.119
that she died

2753.579 --> 2756.94
even interfaced with her

2755.8 --> 2761.2000000000003
like

2756.94 --> 2764.26
in my head came towards me visually

2761.2 --> 2766.359
apparent like a white fail in the black

2764.26 --> 2769.5400000000004
or night outside three o'clock at night

2766.359 --> 2770.74
in the garden came up to me I saw

2769.54 --> 2772.839
something

2770.74 --> 2776.14
like a weird

2772.839 --> 2780.94
light blur moving up

2776.14 --> 2784.06
coming close I felt it was not evil

2780.94 --> 2786.2200000000003
and then came close then suddenly like

2784.06 --> 2790.359
touched me it could feel something touch

2786.22 --> 2793.2599999999998
me without a non-physical touch like in

2790.359 --> 2795.94
my head then in like an

2793.26 --> 2799.0600000000004
interface Mirage

2795.94 --> 2801.88
like I was looking in my imagination but

2799.06 --> 2804.46
that gained the priority so that it's

2801.88 --> 2807.2200000000003
like my eye view and my imagination feel

2804.46 --> 2810.52
temporarily switched a vision interface

2807.22 --> 2815.339
and then I saw her

2810.52 --> 2815.339
as if she was like 20 years old

2815.5 --> 2822.04
it was pretty impressive experience

2819.22 --> 2823.839
was definitely the turning point where I

2822.04 --> 2825.52
knew like okay

2823.839 --> 2827.38
that's real

2825.52 --> 2830.5
and there's nothing in the world that

2827.38 --> 2832.96
could ever dissuade me that this is real

2830.5 --> 2835.24
especially because like after that

2832.96 --> 2838.42
happened I was like whoa

2835.24 --> 2840.4599999999996
what just happened did my mother just

2838.42 --> 2843.7200000000003
die and then my brother came up and said

2840.46 --> 2843.7200000000003
like yeah I just got the call

2847.96 --> 2854.5
pretty remarkable experience it's a Once

2851.859 --> 2856.42
in a Lifetime obviously

2854.5 --> 2859.14
so yeah

2856.42 --> 2859.14
there you go

2867.16 --> 2872.319
that sounds awesome

2869.68 --> 2874.4199999999996
well it's not awesome

2872.319 --> 2876.66
right my mother just died that's not

2874.42 --> 2876.66
awesome

2877.839 --> 2882.46
like

2879.52 --> 2885.88
to be let's get some things straight

2882.46 --> 2888.579
super straight if you will okay

2885.88 --> 2890.319
just because one might have had an

2888.579 --> 2893.44
experience with a ghost

2890.319 --> 2896.5589999999997
in order to establish that that is real

2893.44 --> 2899.38
that doesn't make it a good thing

2896.559 --> 2902.26
that doesn't make

2899.38 --> 2903.94
it like a pleasant moment it's never

2902.26 --> 2907.7200000000003
Pleasant

2903.94 --> 2907.7200000000003
not really it's

2908.559 --> 2912.119
I don't know what it is

2916.66 --> 2920.7
but that there's something else well

2920.92 --> 2925.96
dude

2922.359 --> 2927.7
like I like my healer just basically

2925.96 --> 2930.339
laid some things on me that were

2927.7 --> 2934.0
absolutely shocking

2930.339 --> 2937.359
again because I was kind of like told

2934.0 --> 2942.18
and seduced to do certain things way

2937.359 --> 2942.18
back because of that right

2943.0 --> 2946.98
and it's just shocked to hear like

2947.14 --> 2950.339
like [ __ ]

2950.74 --> 2954.24
the most

2952.359 --> 2957.16
painful

2954.24 --> 2959.5589999999997
psychological torture that happened in

2957.16 --> 2961.66
my past

2959.559 --> 2965.02
was

2961.66 --> 2968.2
me being told the truth in moments where

2965.02 --> 2969.099
I had absolutely no ability to deal with

2968.2 --> 2971.859
it

2969.099 --> 2973.8
or rather to deal with it properly so

2971.859 --> 2977.92
that it would

2973.8 --> 2980.559
cause side effects that would make me

2977.92 --> 2982.78
lead astray instead of just taking the

2980.559 --> 2985.48
knowledge for what it is putting it in

2982.78 --> 2987.46
the background and just trusting

2985.48 --> 2990.599
whatever it is I'm doing

2987.46 --> 2990.599
yeah that [ __ ]

3009.24 --> 3014.359
is my healer a flat earther

3011.52 --> 3014.359
uh

3016.74 --> 3021.359
well he's not really concerned about

3019.28 --> 3024.6600000000003
cosmogini and

3021.359 --> 3029.52
I have told him about Flat Earth

3024.66 --> 3033.2999999999997
and he has recognized but like for him

3029.52 --> 3035.52
it's too difficult because there is like

3033.3 --> 3037.7400000000002
a spirit cosmology

3035.52 --> 3042.78
and there

3037.74 --> 3046.5589999999997
it kind of works with planets and stars

3042.78 --> 3050.0400000000004
right but he knows it's not physical

3046.559 --> 3052.1400000000003
but it's just too confusing for him

3050.04 --> 3055.98
to get into the

3052.14 --> 3058.74
more the substance of the cosmogony in

3055.98 --> 3063.72
the real world it's it's like it

3058.74 --> 3065.64
diffuses his ultimate power basically so

3063.72 --> 3068.8799999999997
yeah

3065.64 --> 3071.4
he's not really a flat earther like I am

3068.88 --> 3075.059
and the guys and

3071.4 --> 3076.92
but he he knows what it is he knows I'm

3075.059 --> 3080.1600000000003
basically

3076.92 --> 3082.38
doing a spirit thing

3080.16 --> 3085.74
and that it's good

3082.38 --> 3088.98
so he's not against it in any way like

3085.74 --> 3092.2799999999997
he recognizes like for him it is also

3088.98 --> 3095.099
just a discovery all the way about how

3092.28 --> 3097.02
many things we are being lied to about

3095.099 --> 3100.319
right and there's a lot of things he

3097.02 --> 3102.54
finds out even through his guides

3100.319 --> 3104.22
but it's always something that he is

3102.54 --> 3107.04
going to be touching upon and there's

3104.22 --> 3108.319
still a lot of things that he bumps into

3107.04 --> 3111.599
that

3108.319 --> 3114.2
turn out to be unexpected to him in that

3111.599 --> 3114.2000000000003
moment so

3117.42 --> 3123.559
dude what who is this and what are you

3120.839 --> 3123.5589999999997
blabbering about

3127.94 --> 3131.3
aoao what

3141.48 --> 3147.619
all right hey Amanda you what happened I

3144.18 --> 3147.6189999999997
got a call during the show

3157.26 --> 3161.1600000000003
if the controllers are hidden no but

3159.18 --> 3165.0589999999997
they're not hidden I'm scrolling back

3161.16 --> 3167.7
now to before the call steamy Traveler

3165.059 --> 3170.28
the controllers are not hidden they're

3167.7 --> 3173.18
never really hidden they might be hidden

3170.28 --> 3175.619
from The Superficial media control

3173.18 --> 3178.9199999999996
apparatus right

3175.619 --> 3181.2000000000003
very easy to figure out who they're all

3178.92 --> 3183.42
tied into it just gets all really

3181.2 --> 3185.16
convoluted that's the problem and that's

3183.42 --> 3187.02
why

3185.16 --> 3191.359
top need

3187.02 --> 3191.359
s stop letting that discourage you

3191.94 --> 3197.4
right

3193.319 --> 3199.619
it's like a rough comparison very rough

3197.4 --> 3203.7000000000003
ly

3199.619 --> 3206.28
it's like if you have a kid or teenager

3203.7 --> 3208.9199999999996
that's like going really astray and

3206.28 --> 3212.0400000000004
they're like not responding to your

3208.92 --> 3214.5
moral input anymore

3212.04 --> 3217.5589999999997
you got to figure out what other

3214.5 --> 3219.24
influence is working in on them

3217.559 --> 3220.92
and if you then find out that they're

3219.24 --> 3224.16
like part of a gang

3220.92 --> 3226.559
who are all terrible

3224.16 --> 3230.52
then effectively

3226.559 --> 3233.3390000000004
you can't let defining that out stop you

3230.52 --> 3235.2
from engaging and say like oh well that

3233.339 --> 3237.24
means it's too much

3235.2 --> 3239.3999999999996
that becomes too complicated it's going

3237.24 --> 3242.04
to get too much of a hassle because

3239.4 --> 3246.38
otherwise

3242.04 --> 3246.38
yeah they will take over

3246.72 --> 3251.9599999999996
some rough comparison but it's the best

3249.18 --> 3251.96
I can give you

3252.9 --> 3259.88
right so these controllers you go with

3256.02 --> 3259.88
who is executing the plants

3259.92 --> 3265.7400000000002
follow them where did they get the

3262.02 --> 3268.859
plants then who wrote the plans

3265.74 --> 3271.2
who decided upon the plants and you take

3268.859 --> 3274.14
every one of them

3271.2 --> 3275.5789999999997
and you pry all that information out of

3274.14 --> 3277.74
them because as soon as they're actually

3275.579 --> 3279.6600000000003
going to get caught there's just no way

3277.74 --> 3282.24
that they're not gonna squeal on each

3279.66 --> 3284.46
other because they all know how [ __ ]

3282.24 --> 3286.2
up it is what they've done

3284.46 --> 3289.44
they're all gonna be like oh please

3286.2 --> 3293.5789999999997
don't kill me ah I know it's so [ __ ]

3289.44 --> 3296.339
up help me I'm just a I'm just a pawn

3293.579 --> 3299.46
that's what they're all gonna do

3296.339 --> 3302.4
so that should not be difficult to

3299.46 --> 3305.28
literally round it all up that way get

3302.4 --> 3309.48
everybody that's involved

3305.28 --> 3313.799
actually did it everybody that was there

3309.48 --> 3316.7400000000002
you'll they're not hidden if they do

3313.799 --> 3318.299
things that influence the world then

3316.74 --> 3321.839
they're not hidden

3318.299 --> 3324.2
it's impossible that's a myth to believe

3321.839 --> 3324.2
that

3327.01 --> 3334.8190000000004
[Music]

3330.02 --> 3334.819
man I feel a lot better right now

3337.74 --> 3343.0789999999997
okay dude I'm I'm sorry man but

something so who are you how did you

3403.5 --> 3407.48
come

3404.28 --> 3407.48
on to this channel

3411.119 --> 3416.52
hey good servant good to see you man

3414.72 --> 3418.2599999999998
how are you doing I hope you're doing

3416.52 --> 3421.04
better you've been through some rough

3418.26 --> 3421.0400000000004
times I heard

3425.16 --> 3431.2799999999997
oh all right right well

3428.52 --> 3432.72
those do I think on average tend to heal

3431.28 --> 3436.38
better

3432.72 --> 3440.3999999999996
right because it's a really a thing like

3436.38 --> 3442.2200000000003
a a part of the body you use a lot

3440.4 --> 3445.799
will be more

3442.22 --> 3447.359
uh resilient to to fractures and all

3445.799 --> 3449.579
that and so as long as it's not like

3447.359 --> 3452.5789999999997
Snapped off or anything

3449.579 --> 3455.04
yeah it will actually even potentially

3452.579 --> 3457.1400000000003
help you get stronger

3455.04 --> 3460.38
but it would be good to look into what

3457.14 --> 3463.5
kind of nutritions you might want to

3460.38 --> 3465.48
take in while recovering things like

3463.5 --> 3468.559
bone broth

3465.48 --> 3468.559
I'd recommend it

3474.66 --> 3478.94
you're doing great good to hear Nathan

3480.599 --> 3485.299
okay you found me through Nathan Oakley

3485.96 --> 3490.52
aoao can I call you aoao

3497.099 --> 3502.319
yes that's more red yeah you're welcome

3499.14 --> 3503.4
and good luck with that also if at some

3502.319 --> 3505.5
point

3503.4 --> 3509.52
like it's

3505.5 --> 3512.22
Kelsey well Yak of course calcium also

3509.52 --> 3515.42
natural calcium I would take calcium

3512.22 --> 3515.4199999999996
through vegetables

3515.46 --> 3520.98
filtered water

3518.22 --> 3523.799
uh

3520.98 --> 3527.04
but if you for example have inflammation

3523.799 --> 3529.44
issues as like a side agitation

3527.04 --> 3532.98
then I'd go for some turmeric

3529.44 --> 3536.94
also because that both smoothens out

3532.98 --> 3539.7
inflammation helps the joints serious

3536.94 --> 3543.2000000000003
it's like yeah

3539.7 --> 3543.2
that might do really good

3550.74 --> 3556.22
it's speed

3553.2 --> 3556.22
how do you know

3558.0 --> 3565.44
like Peach Shea is not blocked I think

3562.14 --> 3568.2599999999998
here I didn't block peachy

3565.44 --> 3570.18
let me check

3568.26 --> 3573.619
we might have because he just

3570.18 --> 3573.6189999999997
did some crazy talk

3581.66 --> 3585.66
researchers what

3586.08 --> 3590.399
[Music]

3592.859 --> 3600.18
get vitamin K well yeah Vitamin K is

3596.28 --> 3604.94
well I take vitamin K combination with

3600.18 --> 3604.94
vitamin D3 because it amplifies it

3605.28 --> 3611.2200000000003
make sure you absorb it better

3608.04 --> 3614.22
right so yeah of course all the

3611.22 --> 3614.22
supplements

3615.9 --> 3620.81
that could work great

3618.96 --> 3623.869
J

3620.81 --> 3623.869
[Music]

3629.94 --> 3633.78
nope I don't have Peach a blocked so

3632.28 --> 3635.94
that makes no sense

3633.78 --> 3639.02
I don't see why he would use a soccer

3635.94 --> 3639.02
counter come on here

3639.14 --> 3642.3199999999997
[Music]

3648.2 --> 3654.359
I don't know why you would guys would

3650.7 --> 3657.96
think that aoao is Peachy because peache

3654.359 --> 3660.24
is never that short worded you know that

3657.96 --> 3663.2
every time he always has to blurt out

3660.24 --> 3663.2
some kind of puzzle

3665.04 --> 3669.859
I haven't seen this aoao guy do that yet

3672.18 --> 3677.299
Hard Time closing myself right yeah that

3674.819 --> 3677.299
makes sense

3684.78 --> 3687.44
what

3687.9 --> 3691.099
see your button

3709.5 --> 3715.14
oh okay Patricia Dockery well

3712.68 --> 3717.8999999999996
I didn't know that but then again taking

3715.14 --> 3721.02
blood thinners is bad

3717.9 --> 3724.7000000000003
and yeah

3721.02 --> 3724.7
I would never recommend that

3736.46 --> 3740.819
means

3738.119 --> 3743.359
before

3740.819 --> 3743.359
okay

3744.539 --> 3748.8590000000004
no I I didn't assume that was Irish it's

3747.119 --> 3752.52
more like

3748.859 --> 3757.44
like what is it there there

3752.52 --> 3760.4
Russian or Greek type of alphabet

3757.44 --> 3760.4
what is that

3772.14 --> 3774.6189999999997
right

3788.96 --> 3795.559
Cyrillic alphabet right right right

3792.96 --> 3795.559
anyway

3796.619 --> 3802.319
right yes Amanda you yes oh yeah taking

3799.319 --> 3805.14
vitamin D3 is good but if you take

3802.319 --> 3806.579
vitamin K K2

3805.14 --> 3810.9
with that

3806.579 --> 3813.3590000000004
then your body absorbs it a lot better

3810.9 --> 3814.44
now a lot of vitamin D3 you should check

3813.359 --> 3815.819
that

3814.44 --> 3819.539
like

3815.819 --> 3822.18
do have also okay too with them but it

3819.539 --> 3825.0
all depends like there are some formulas

3822.18 --> 3826.98
that combine it

3825.0 --> 3829.92
but if you're going to take the vitamin

3826.98 --> 3834.14
D3 then also taking vitamin K will

3829.92 --> 3834.14
definitely improve the effect

3852.4 --> 3855.889
[Music]

3859.49 --> 3863.41
[Music]

3874.5 --> 3882.44
you can get vitamin K from leafy greens

3878.22 --> 3882.4399999999996
leafy greens what's that

3883.4 --> 3887.42
oh obviously a plant

3891.12 --> 3894.27
[Music]

3895.5 --> 3901.039
oh

3896.88 --> 3901.039
just Leaf vegetables

3910.2 --> 3913.0989999999997
you must use this

3919.079 --> 3925.44
salad kale okay

3922.799 --> 3928.46
my eyes look puffy

3925.44 --> 3928.46
really they do

3930.78 --> 3936.44
am I tired

3933.42 --> 3936.44
well a little

3936.48 --> 3944.4
it's like seriously my healer just

3939.539 --> 3948.1800000000003
basically cleaned up a lot of garbage

3944.4 --> 3951.599
and because of that like a level of

3948.18 --> 3954.3799999999997
peace came rolling over me

3951.599 --> 3954.38
but yeah

3955.799 --> 3960.66
it would have been great if I had that a

3958.68 --> 3963.74
little bit earlier but yeah he's very

3960.66 --> 3963.74
busy man right now

3963.839 --> 3966.72
like At first I asked him to call me

3965.94 --> 3970.5
back

3966.72 --> 3973.64
but he was like literally too busy so it

3970.5 --> 3973.64
was either now or tomorrow

3975.0 --> 3979.44
I look tired I don't really feel that

3977.16 --> 3982.74
tired good servant I have actually slept

3979.44 --> 3987.619
really well despite like the

3982.74 --> 3987.6189999999997
night time unhappiness moment

3987.66 --> 3993.24
because as soon as I get over that like

3990.66 --> 3995.94
I sleep really well it's like even in

3993.24 --> 3998.5789999999997
the times when it was like very well for

3995.94 --> 4000.68
my level seriously depressed and I

3998.579 --> 4002.92
haven't been like that in years and

4000.68 --> 4007.16
years and decades thank God

4002.92 --> 4010.039
but even then I could always sleep it

4007.16 --> 4012.5589999999997
was the waking up part that was the part

4010.039 --> 4014.8390000000004
when I just got really

4012.559 --> 4017.059
like I hated the mornings I wouldn't go

4014.839 --> 4018.859
to bed because it's not that they

4017.059 --> 4020.78
couldn't go to sleep it's just that I

4018.859 --> 4023.119
would have to wake up again

4020.78 --> 4025.7000000000003
that's the bad that was always the the

4023.119 --> 4027.619
suckiest part getting back into the

4025.7 --> 4030.319
physical world feeling the way that I

4027.619 --> 4033.28
did because sleeping for me has never

4030.319 --> 4033.2799999999997
been a real problem

4034.22 --> 4039.68
as soon as I learned to meditate to call

4036.799 --> 4042.2
my mind to make it stop racing

4039.68 --> 4046.4199999999996
it was just smooth sailing from there

4042.2 --> 4046.4199999999996
I've never had real sleeping problems

4056.96 --> 4062.5
hey AGM don't it's the [ __ ]

4062.74 --> 4066.02
[Music]

4070.52 --> 4079.07
God Leroy helps immunity yeah sure

4075.83 --> 4079.0699999999997
[Music]

4079.099 --> 4084.6800000000003
or fish oil to me had been like was the

4083.42 --> 4087.819
thing

4084.68 --> 4090.799
that helped me solve any kind of like

4087.819 --> 4094.0589999999997
spiraling depression situation

4090.799 --> 4094.059
it was always because

4095.299 --> 4101.6
like yeah because depression Cycles one

4099.14 --> 4103.279
could say are like a spiral that slowly

4101.6 --> 4105.92
goes downward

4103.279 --> 4108.1990000000005
but it's oh every time I took fish oil

4105.92 --> 4110.54
and persistently

4108.199 --> 4113.678999999999
starting with a lot would immediately

4110.54 --> 4113.679
break me out of that

4113.719 --> 4119.719
so to me I see it like if you have

4117.14 --> 4123.5
depression influences it's probably due

4119.719 --> 4126.5
to a lack of fish oil specifically fish

4123.5 --> 4129.819
fish oil pure form

4126.5 --> 4129.819
fish or krill oil

4131.06 --> 4134.319
it has been for me

4155.0 --> 4159.4
finally back on track was good to hear

4157.219 --> 4159.4
man

4160.159 --> 4164.3189999999995
you got me a little worried last time

4164.779 --> 4168.819
but you also do feel

4171.64 --> 4176.839
like you're not being hooked and pulled

4174.62 --> 4178.58
into the darkness as much right now so

4176.839 --> 4180.3189999999995
I'm really glad for you you're doing

4178.58 --> 4183.08
better

4180.319 --> 4185.679
hey jado by the way

4183.08 --> 4185.679
see you

4190.83 --> 4196.009
[Music]

4201.62 --> 4206.8
all right

4203.84 --> 4206.8
by the way

4207.08 --> 4212.96
can I get some sort of feedback from you

4210.26 --> 4215.42
guys about yeah what I did yesterday

4212.96 --> 4219.7390000000005
just

4215.42 --> 4223.34
like was that good did I go too far

4219.739 --> 4226.218999999999
because it was Wrath and just by

4223.34 --> 4227.78
principle wrath is

4226.219 --> 4231.38
wrong

4227.78 --> 4232.5199999999995
it's difficult to size up

4231.38 --> 4235.6990000000005
because

4232.52 --> 4239.780000000001
even Jesus had his moments of Wrath like

4235.699 --> 4244.0
Justified wrath right it's not like a

4239.78 --> 4244.0
I for an eye type of ref

4245.6 --> 4248.14
but

4249.92 --> 4255.46
is it

4251.659 --> 4255.46
I'm kind of conflicted by it

4261.739 --> 4267.08
gets I know good servant

4265.699 --> 4270.199
by the way thank you for the dollar

4267.08 --> 4272.719
Super Chat donation much appreciated

4270.199 --> 4275.12
and thanks for yeah the PayPal donations

4272.719 --> 4277.42
over the last month that's been great

4275.12 --> 4277.42
man

4281.12 --> 4283.9
hey

4298.19 --> 4301.32
[Music]

4308.36 --> 4312.759999999999
but yeah is there any feedback

4314.3 --> 4319.42
from yesterday what do you guys feel

4316.94 --> 4319.419999999999
about it

4326.36 --> 4332.0
because yeah I know if you compare it

4329.12 --> 4333.199
probably to what some people do on the

4332.0 --> 4335.54
internet

4333.199 --> 4337.4
then it's like oh well it's probably not

4335.54 --> 4340.58
that bad you know compared to so much

4337.4 --> 4342.98
but yeah well just because they're all

4340.58 --> 4344.6
going completely [ __ ] up out of

4342.98 --> 4347.178999999999
control

4344.6 --> 4349.76
just being complete idiots

4347.179 --> 4353.02
does that mean that I should compare

4349.76 --> 4353.02
myself to that as well

4353.78 --> 4360.259999999999
like does them all going demonic excuse

4358.28 --> 4363.32
me

4360.26 --> 4364.76
potentially sliding sideways

4363.32 --> 4369.34
with Wrath

4364.76 --> 4369.34
like I'm maybe I'm just

4369.56 --> 4376.6990000000005
being an overly purist about it

4373.52 --> 4379.1
oh Chad's Frozen no it's not frozen it's

4376.699 --> 4381.678999999999
just a little delayed

4379.1 --> 4384.58
but yeah thanks for

4381.679 --> 4384.58
paying attention

4385.88 --> 4391.179
it hasn't Frozen on me yet since I did

4388.159 --> 4391.179
the new overhaul

4398.239 --> 4404.659
right oh hey dank not enough people are

4401.719 --> 4406.94
in the camera screaming do anything I

4404.659 --> 4409.299999999999
admire it but you beat yourself up also

4406.94 --> 4409.299999999999
okay

4411.98 --> 4416.839999999999
right

4413.96 --> 4418.82
but it's also kind of like why I let it

4416.84 --> 4421.659000000001
happen it's just that I'm kind of afraid

4418.82 --> 4424.099999999999
of doing it not afraid for this [ __ ]

4421.659 --> 4426.0199999999995
Satan machine out there

4424.1 --> 4429.219
I'm afraid of God

4426.02 --> 4429.219
I'm afraid that

4429.62 --> 4436.36
that I might be shooting myself in the

4432.38 --> 4436.36
foot spiritual wise doing it

4438.44 --> 4442.94
but maybe it's just the time and the

4440.9 --> 4445.219
place for it

4442.94 --> 4449.419999999999
but yeah every time afterwards like I

4445.219 --> 4451.78
afterward I had like this like

4449.42 --> 4455.179
foreign

4451.78 --> 4457.34
of heaviness like I just got into a

4455.179 --> 4460.1
fight with somebody and that's always

4457.34 --> 4463.42
feels bad afterwards if you if if it's

4460.1 --> 4463.42
somebody that you're kind of close to

4470.42 --> 4475.4800000000005
all right Ralph Rodriguez thank you

4476.719 --> 4480.86
trajectory is a good one you might

4479.36 --> 4482.839999999999
deviate here and there but the general

4480.86 --> 4487.48
direction is good I

4482.84 --> 4487.4800000000005
I really appreciate that I really do

4487.82 --> 4491.719
because you're trying to address really

4489.92 --> 4494.54
what is my concern

4491.719 --> 4498.76
like I'm afraid to slip away from the

4494.54 --> 4498.76
Narrow Path I'm really afraid of it

4502.94 --> 4510.5
in ways I've already slipped very far

4507.44 --> 4513.08
right there's so much

4510.5 --> 4515.78
logos I've broken off

4513.08 --> 4518.179
in the past

4515.78 --> 4519.62
making me end up in this position right

4518.179 --> 4522.34
and I explained this really at the

4519.62 --> 4522.34
beginning of the show

4523.4 --> 4529.5199999999995
and I'm like I I can't defeat any

4525.98 --> 4531.739
further I I have to get the last bit of

4529.52 --> 4534.320000000001
logos I gotta get it right I'm I'm

4531.739 --> 4537.28
seriously afraid of God guys I'm

4534.32 --> 4537.28
seriously afraid

4537.62 --> 4541.36
because I see my failures

4551.78 --> 4557.0599999999995
write your own thoughts down for people

4553.94 --> 4560.419999999999
in the future or isn't this isn't that

4557.06 --> 4562.820000000001
exactly what this show is

4560.42 --> 4564.86
practically

4562.82 --> 4567.159
who says people in the future can even

4564.86 --> 4567.159
read

4583.1 --> 4589.58
correcting our failures is the key yes

4587.0 --> 4591.5
it is

4589.58 --> 4595.46
but

4591.5 --> 4599.0
if you keep making the same mistake

4595.46 --> 4601.4
and then try to correct it afterward

4599.0 --> 4603.38
are you really learning from the mistake

4601.4 --> 4606.139999999999
or are you then actually eventually

4603.38 --> 4608.179
turning to doubling down on the mistake

4606.14 --> 4611.2390000000005
and then it becomes

4608.179 --> 4613.58
pointless to apologize for it right

4611.239 --> 4616.599999999999
where is the line

4613.58 --> 4616.6
where is it really

4627.26 --> 4631.12
maybe a power shortage what

4638.56 --> 4644.06
just for posterity

4641.48 --> 4646.699
well look if there would be some kind of

4644.06 --> 4648.56
a prolonged blackout situation

4646.699 --> 4652.46
and there would be literally no more

4648.56 --> 4656.360000000001
internet and everything not even phones

4652.46 --> 4657.44
you betcha I'll I still got blank papers

4656.36 --> 4659.839999999999
here

4657.44 --> 4662.0599999999995
I would freaking start writing because

4659.84 --> 4666.219
there's literally no other way I could

4662.06 --> 4666.219
keep my mind going anymore

4667.52 --> 4673.6990000000005
right so yeah like

4670.64 --> 4677.360000000001
it's like this apparently there's a part

4673.699 --> 4679.699
of me that just really really doesn't

4677.36 --> 4681.98
want me writing books like really

4679.699 --> 4685.219
doesn't so it'll literally have to be

4681.98 --> 4687.32
the end of the world before I start

4685.219 --> 4690.08
writing a book right

4687.32 --> 4693.679
it would literally have to be the end of

4690.08 --> 4695.0599999999995
the world before I start writing a book

4693.679 --> 4699.9400000000005
and

4695.06 --> 4699.9400000000005
maybe that's not too far into the future

4707.48 --> 4711.379999999999
and with the end of the world I don't

4709.28 --> 4714.44
mean absolute destruction of all

4711.38 --> 4716.900000000001
creation I mean like the end of just

4714.44 --> 4719.86
this civilization

4716.9 --> 4719.86
like completely

4728.96 --> 4733.46
revelation

4730.82 --> 4737.659
will happen as it is manifesting right

4733.46 --> 4741.58
before dude IGM if you say so

4737.659 --> 4741.58
at this point you know I'm

4742.88 --> 4749.06
it feels in ways like I'm so far in over

4745.88 --> 4753.46
my head like I'd welcome that like yeah

4749.06 --> 4753.46
sure I hope I'm worthy enough

4762.56 --> 4765.159000000001
okay

4796.04 --> 4801.92
red super straighter through well what

4798.44 --> 4805.239
if during a fight you fall down

4801.92 --> 4805.2390000000005
break your arm

4806.659 --> 4810.46
how are you gonna hit them harder

4810.739 --> 4815.599999999999
no you have to surrender then you have

4813.62 --> 4817.099999999999
to hope you're not going to be enslaved

4815.6 --> 4820.04
you're going to get out of it

4817.1 --> 4822.4400000000005
and then recover that arm and then it

4820.04 --> 4824.9
might if if you get through all that

4822.44 --> 4827.0
then eventually it might heal up to even

4824.9 --> 4829.82
be stronger right

4827.0 --> 4832.06
that's kind of a better comparison to my

4829.82 --> 4832.0599999999995
life

4832.82 --> 4837.98
I wanted to fight back I wanted to break

4835.52 --> 4841.400000000001
out I didn't have the power I didn't

4837.98 --> 4843.32
have it I had Purity didn't have the

4841.4 --> 4844.4
power didn't have the grip didn't have

4843.32 --> 4847.5199999999995
to

4844.4 --> 4850.5199999999995
wisdom didn't have enough information

4847.52 --> 4854.179
having passed through my Consciousness

4850.52 --> 4859.159000000001
in linear time in order to establish

4854.179 --> 4862.6990000000005
a true grip on things I didn't have it

4859.159 --> 4865.28
I was too weak it's just a fact I was

4862.699 --> 4868.219
too weak there was nothing I could have

4865.28 --> 4870.38
done I was deluded people weren't able

4868.219 --> 4873.639
to break me out I was literally

4870.38 --> 4877.82
desperate at times like can you please

4873.639 --> 4880.28
not give up on trying to make me stop

4877.82 --> 4883.82
doing this please and they will do it

4880.28 --> 4884.48
anyway because there was too much for

4883.82 --> 4887.48
them

4884.48 --> 4889.5199999999995
everybody was too weak

4887.48 --> 4891.919999999999
yeah that makes you feel like like

4889.52 --> 4894.26
everything is doomed when that happens

4891.92 --> 4896.179
and everybody like even the ones that

4894.26 --> 4899.6
shouldn't give up when you give up on

4896.179 --> 4902.179
you that feels like everything is doomed

4899.6 --> 4905.6
that's one of the things that makes you

4902.179 --> 4908.9
go off into permanent autopilot

4905.6 --> 4911.179
and then if your spark is not clear

4908.9 --> 4912.98
enough you'll go into darkness and never

4911.179 --> 4915.08
get out of it

4912.98 --> 4918.379999999999
if this spark doesn't prevent it well

4915.08 --> 4920.5
with me it prevented that I knew like I

4918.38 --> 4920.5
can't

4921.02 --> 4926.7390000000005
I can't be seduced even though I feel

4923.48 --> 4926.739
like totally broken

4929.48 --> 4934.28
but yeah because I've been like that and

4931.58 --> 4938.48
have been recovered I got maybe perhaps

4934.28 --> 4941.48
a little bit more tools available to me

4938.48 --> 4944.48
and at the same time having now

4941.48 --> 4945.678999999999
feeling like I've wasted 20 years of my

4944.48 --> 4948.62
life that

4945.679 --> 4950.96
can never be unwasted

4948.62 --> 4953.739
I can never have what I kind of

4950.96 --> 4953.7390000000005
originally wanted

4955.58 --> 4962.679
I might have something

4958.82 --> 4962.679
never have what I really wanted

4965.84 --> 4972.02
and so well the second alternative to

4969.26 --> 4974.6
that is absolute vengeance

4972.02 --> 4978.219
for everything that prevented me from

4974.6 --> 4978.219
having exactly what I wanted

4981.8 --> 4988.6990000000005
right and yeah something that I said

4985.699 --> 4990.919999999999
yesterday made me afterward feel really

4988.699 --> 4992.299999999999
stupid I have to admit this I almost

4990.92 --> 4995.3
forgot that

4992.3 --> 4998.84
when I was talking about

4995.3 --> 5001.659000000001
like they all need to just get really

4998.84 --> 5004.860000000001
punished and dirty executions I'll be

5001.659 --> 5007.299999999999
watching drooling like [ __ ]

5004.86 --> 5009.82
salude [ __ ] I've never said

5007.3 --> 5010.659000000001
something so so excited on camera in my

5009.82 --> 5014.5599999999995
life

5010.659 --> 5016.42
that's so dumb I'm really like heavily

5014.56 --> 5019.179
embarrassed on the intellectual level

5016.42 --> 5022.06
that I actually said that even though it

5019.179 --> 5025.42
was passion in the moment yeah where

5022.06 --> 5028.120000000001
that's the thing right that's the trick

5025.42 --> 5031.0
right then

5028.12 --> 5033.34
if it would like instantly happen right

5031.0 --> 5035.32
then it's like oh news announcement look

5033.34 --> 5037.6
they've been finally caught right now

5035.32 --> 5040.42
they're being executed yeah yeah then

5037.6 --> 5042.9400000000005
right which is purely theoretic would

5040.42 --> 5045.1
never ever happen like that then I might

5042.94 --> 5048.219
be drooling like because it's a sudden

5045.1 --> 5050.1990000000005
release of all this giant tension guess

5048.219 --> 5054.58
what it's never gonna happen like that

5050.199 --> 5057.638999999999
it's gonna be a slow aggravating weight

5054.58 --> 5059.86
like 40 years before the people

5057.639 --> 5062.02
responsible for this are finally gonna

5059.86 --> 5065.259999999999
get through all the [ __ ] trials and

5062.02 --> 5067.42
[ __ ] to get there probably

5065.26 --> 5070.06
the way I foresee it

5067.42 --> 5073.36
and then guess what when it's that time

5070.06 --> 5075.88
I it'll just make me feel hurt for even

5073.36 --> 5079.0
associating or putting my attention

5075.88 --> 5080.5
towards that and their execution or

5079.0 --> 5083.08
whatever

5080.5 --> 5085.36
and I would just be like no I I just

5083.08 --> 5087.94
wish I never even heard of them I don't

5085.36 --> 5091.54
even want to see them I just want them

5087.94 --> 5094.36
to have never existed right so it's so

5091.54 --> 5096.28
stupid afterward that I said that I have

5094.36 --> 5099.82
to correct that because it was just

5096.28 --> 5101.0199999999995
intellectually inept to actually go with

5099.82 --> 5104.34
that

5101.02 --> 5104.34
totally embarrassing

5104.44 --> 5107.259999999999
because the reality that could never

5106.0 --> 5109.78
happen

5107.26 --> 5112.0
I would never get to that position to

5109.78 --> 5114.099999999999
actually

5112.0 --> 5119.32
be in the mood

5114.1 --> 5121.659000000001
to well enjoy the Wrath like that no if

5119.32 --> 5122.98
it if it happens and in a way I do hope

5121.659 --> 5125.138999999999
it does happen

5122.98 --> 5127.0599999999995
it's always going to be bitter in the

5125.139 --> 5130.0
end always

5127.06 --> 5132.52
because a wrath never leads to happiness

5130.0 --> 5135.28
and that's part of the design it's part

5132.52 --> 5139.8
of the warnings it's part of logos that

5135.28 --> 5139.8
wraths never leads to happiness ever

5140.62 --> 5146.08
it's also not what it's for it's rather

5143.56 --> 5147.6990000000005
like an emergency

5146.08 --> 5150.5199999999995
operation

5147.699 --> 5153.219
like we're about to die

5150.52 --> 5155.92
we have to now do this

5153.219 --> 5159.52
or we'll die it's just survival it's

5155.92 --> 5163.56
like a survival Instinct thing

5159.52 --> 5163.56
but it never leads to happiness

5174.94 --> 5177.48
all right

5177.58 --> 5184.96
so all that passion and all that

5181.12 --> 5187.78
Fire coming out of me it worries me

5184.96 --> 5189.76
it worries me it's starting to I'm

5187.78 --> 5191.92
starting to perceive it more like a

5189.76 --> 5194.139
weakness than ever than some kind of

5191.92 --> 5196.36
thing that's cool or whatever or that

5194.139 --> 5198.46
people might appreciate originally I

5196.36 --> 5201.159
thought like yeah I can express this I

5198.46 --> 5203.32
can express the feelings that people are

5201.159 --> 5205.799999999999
probably sitting on and now I'm

5203.32 --> 5205.799999999999
wondering

5207.1 --> 5214.02
how is this gonna end well

5210.699 --> 5214.0199999999995
I don't see it anymore

5214.06 --> 5219.4800000000005
maybe I have been seduced by Lucifer to

5217.12 --> 5219.48
do that

5229.179 --> 5233.679
fight or flight Ralph Rodriguez yeah

5231.34 --> 5236.88
good point it is like a fight Instinct

5233.679 --> 5236.88
isn't it Wrath

5237.159 --> 5241.36
maybe it is indeed from the fight or

5239.38 --> 5244.32
flight Instinct that that's where it's

5241.36 --> 5244.32
come come from

5252.58 --> 5255.12
right

5255.94 --> 5261.339999999999
yeah super straight Earth you're totally

5257.98 --> 5263.099999999999
correct you know weird thing I'll share

5261.34 --> 5265.0
this

5263.1 --> 5268.4800000000005
weird thing

5265.0 --> 5271.12
like what my healer said to me

5268.48 --> 5272.86
and

5271.12 --> 5275.98
because of the context of everything

5272.86 --> 5277.239
that's out there right he basically said

5275.98 --> 5278.98
no

5277.239 --> 5282.178999999999
it's fine

5278.98 --> 5284.5
everything we see it's all going to be

5282.179 --> 5288.0
resolved like

5284.5 --> 5291.04
basically trust the plan right oh

5288.0 --> 5294.48
allergic reactions are approaching

5291.04 --> 5294.48
trusting the plan

5296.32 --> 5301.719
oh but yeah guess what

5299.199 --> 5305.08
it's from the spirit world it's not like

5301.719 --> 5306.4
people out here having a plan it's not q

5305.08 --> 5311.199
and on

5306.4 --> 5313.839999999999
their plan or the right wing Republican

5311.199 --> 5316.78
plan or any no no no

5313.84 --> 5320.4400000000005
this is like God's plan the one that I

5316.78 --> 5323.98
set like two weeks ago like was what

5320.44 --> 5325.299999999999
kind of a plan is this right in extreme

5323.98 --> 5329.28
frustration

5325.3 --> 5329.28
what kind of a plan is this well

5332.56 --> 5339.280000000001
apparently

5335.26 --> 5342.6990000000005
somehow there's a lot of people at it

5339.28 --> 5345.159
so in a way one could even say that my

5342.699 --> 5346.48
expressions and the the fire behind it

5345.159 --> 5349.719
and the Wrath

5346.48 --> 5352.239
it's not falling to death here that deaf

5349.719 --> 5355.06
ears perhaps

5352.239 --> 5358.739
perhaps there might be a lot of people

5355.06 --> 5358.7390000000005
like that are about to

5358.96 --> 5365.139
unfold

5361.48 --> 5367.78
that well for obvious reasons are

5365.139 --> 5370.900000000001
behind the scenes

5367.78 --> 5373.719
not the scenes of governments I could

5370.9 --> 5376.5599999999995
trust you on that

5373.719 --> 5376.56
and

5377.92 --> 5385.62
that have either been censored from

5381.28 --> 5385.62
Media or have avoided it on purpose

5390.82 --> 5395.44
you trusted the plan yes

5396.699 --> 5402.4
yeah ajm so that I know I know that

5399.76 --> 5403.92
that's why I said like oh great trust

5402.4 --> 5407.32
the plan

5403.92 --> 5409.42
allergic response ensues yeah that's

5407.32 --> 5413.4
totally understandable

5409.42 --> 5413.4
and Keel was a giant disaster

5413.5 --> 5420.52
Q was Steve Bannon and Flynn

5416.44 --> 5422.799999999999
well look Q is not it's not even the end

5420.52 --> 5426.219
it just didn't work out it didn't

5422.8 --> 5428.62
connect like part of things that they

5426.219 --> 5431.199
were planning crumbled right and it's

5428.62 --> 5435.179
probably thanks to Trump that it

5431.199 --> 5435.178999999999
crumbled right yeah

5436.0 --> 5439.48
by the way for those that haven't

5437.679 --> 5442.12
already look

5439.48 --> 5444.159
through the new uh hashtag list I

5442.12 --> 5448.62
updated it

5444.159 --> 5448.62
I added quite a few new things in there

5449.02 --> 5454.499000000001
and altered a couple of things

5451.34 --> 5454.499
[Music]

5460.179 --> 5465.659
so yeah

5461.86 --> 5465.659
that's something I did this morning

5468.58 --> 5473.98
but yeah if Steve Bannon and Clint Flynn

5471.639 --> 5476.9800000000005
like it's not over

5473.98 --> 5480.218999999999
these guys are still there

5476.98 --> 5482.919999999999
I've even heard through Infowars that

5480.219 --> 5484.84
Flynn might actually at some point

5482.92 --> 5487.02
consider running for president or

5484.84 --> 5487.02
something

5488.02 --> 5493.96
it was like a theme of a show one time

5491.139 --> 5498.159000000001
so who knows

5493.96 --> 5500.9800000000005
it's not over yet that it's just that

5498.159 --> 5503.699
yeah that the plan definitely like

5500.98 --> 5503.699
crashed

5504.28 --> 5508.659
recently that happened it's not over yet

5506.8 --> 5512.62
though right lost

5508.659 --> 5515.4
the battle not the war hopefully let's

5512.62 --> 5515.4
just hope that

5522.46 --> 5528.219
but yeah that's not even what my healer

5525.88 --> 5530.56
was referring to when he said like trust

5528.219 --> 5532.659
the plan he was literally talking about

5530.56 --> 5535.92
God's plan the Angels pure Spirit

5532.659 --> 5535.92
cosmology things

5541.48 --> 5548.678999999999
right non-people the the healers the

5544.96 --> 5551.8
spirit workers the the light wherever it

5548.679 --> 5553.9
may arrive wherever it pops up the the

5551.8 --> 5557.139
light web

5553.9 --> 5559.12
the web the spirit web because the light

5557.139 --> 5560.32
arrives in people

5559.12 --> 5562.54
too

5560.32 --> 5566.46
like little kids

5562.54 --> 5566.46
can just be subtly

5566.739 --> 5572.138999999999
they get a huge upload and they become

5570.28 --> 5575.44
amazing people

5572.139 --> 5579.34
even though it might be for example in a

5575.44 --> 5582.339999999999
family that's like not spiritual at all

5579.34 --> 5585.84
I call it the Matilda effect

5582.34 --> 5585.84
remember the book Matilda

5586.84 --> 5591.58
I think it's a Dutch book I'm not sure

5588.58 --> 5592.659
it could be English also but

5591.58 --> 5596.32
that

5592.659 --> 5599.46
that's part of the spirit web the Goon

5596.32 --> 5599.46
one that happens

5609.159 --> 5613.36
the plan is timeless

5614.02 --> 5619.38
who is the light of the world God Big G

5622.12 --> 5627.78
and the angels

5624.58 --> 5627.78
his angels

5637.12 --> 5641.5
I think an accident will happen to Biden

5639.46 --> 5644.08
dude

5641.5 --> 5647.76
when doesn't an accident happen to Biden

5644.08 --> 5647.76
accidents happen to him all the time

5648.4 --> 5652.719
like did you see how he tumbled down

5650.739 --> 5654.5199999999995
that staircase and all that [ __ ] like

5652.719 --> 5657.88
[ __ ] happens to him all the time my bad

5654.52 --> 5660.9400000000005
like he's barely in control anymore man

5657.88 --> 5663.159000000001
I called it I called it before the

5660.94 --> 5665.199
election remember about Biden I said

5663.159 --> 5667.0
like this guy is like ready for

5665.199 --> 5669.099999999999
retirement it's almost like a

5667.0 --> 5671.38
mean-spirited to make him president at

5669.1 --> 5675.52
this point

5671.38 --> 5677.38
and yeah wow did I call it or what

5675.52 --> 5679.96
laughs

5677.38 --> 5682.36
because we hadn't seen nothing yet up

5679.96 --> 5684.52
until that point how crazy things are

5682.36 --> 5688.36
getting with him

5684.52 --> 5691.56
it's just it's like a comedy show

5688.36 --> 5693.88
really a bad comedy like a

5691.56 --> 5696.4800000000005
mean-spirited comedy

5693.88 --> 5698.92
where the suffering

5696.48 --> 5701.799999999999
is getting kind of silly and funny

5698.92 --> 5704.679
almost because it's just so stupid

5701.8 --> 5706.4800000000005
yeah I rolled out that's that's right

5704.679 --> 5709.619
that's the Matilda I was talking about

5706.48 --> 5709.619
Carol Apple thanks

5717.119 --> 5724.239
Trump's daughter up for president ugh

5721.239 --> 5724.239
no

5725.26 --> 5728.04
please

5740.679 --> 5747.3
he wears diapers Biden

5743.739 --> 5747.299999999999
well I wouldn't be surprised

5767.26 --> 5773.76
okay hey Jim

5770.56 --> 5773.76
yeah that's gonna happen

5780.64 --> 5783.799
[Music]

5798.06 --> 5801.4800000000005
parole no

5806.38 --> 5810.42
what are you talking about Good servant

5834.119 --> 5840.339999999999
okay AGM

5836.679 --> 5842.76
whatever man dude what are we gonna do

5840.34 --> 5842.76
about it

5843.639 --> 5848.639
what are you afraid AI is gonna Target

5846.219 --> 5848.639
you

5849.88 --> 5855.6
gonna get those sniper bullets from a

5852.82 --> 5855.599999999999
hundred miles away

5873.4 --> 5876.599999999999
[Music]

5888.34 --> 5893.159000000001
that's ridiculous super straighter if

5890.32 --> 5893.159
they're seriously

5894.34 --> 5898.84
now

5895.719 --> 5901.56
now that is that is ridiculous there's

5898.84 --> 5901.56
never no

5906.04 --> 5912.58
like it doesn't work anymore it doesn't

5909.28 --> 5915.0599999999995
help it's too much

5912.58 --> 5915.0599999999995
stuff

5916.239 --> 5920.138999999999
they're already in control you might you

5918.52 --> 5923.619000000001
might have noticed that they already

5920.139 --> 5925.54
have it right they don't need to do any

5923.619 --> 5928.179
of that

5925.54 --> 5930.42
it's like the best bite is just gonna I

5928.179 --> 5930.42
don't know

5930.88 --> 5936.34
get some kind of a aneurysm or something

5934.179 --> 5939.159
or it will be sad like that you know he

5936.34 --> 5941.619000000001
doesn't he might not actually get it he

5939.159 --> 5943.48
might simply just be retired and they

5941.619 --> 5945.28
just say he gets an aneurysm or

5943.48 --> 5947.5599999999995
something and then you don't see him

5945.28 --> 5950.86
anymore except for occasionally like

5947.56 --> 5954.0
yeah yeah all right that's it they don't

5950.86 --> 5956.92
need any of that garbage they don't need

5954.0 --> 5960.639
what sacrifice their own

5956.92 --> 5962.8
just to get some temporarily crowd

5960.639 --> 5966.28
riling going no

5962.8 --> 5968.679
that's ridiculous I'd never do that it's

5966.28 --> 5972.159
way too much complications they don't

5968.679 --> 5976.1990000000005
they don't have the grip

5972.159 --> 5976.199
to even engage in anything like that

5980.02 --> 5984.88
like Democrats might be sort of at the

5983.44 --> 5988.78
helm right now

5984.88 --> 5992.5
but they're pretty feeble right

5988.78 --> 5995.08
they're feeble emperors

5992.5 --> 5997.239
they're not good

5995.08 --> 6000.54
and what they're doing they're only good

5997.239 --> 6002.699
at being Gammas and keeping control and

6000.54 --> 6004.679
just polarizing the [ __ ] out of

6002.699 --> 6006.0599999999995
everything divide and conquer that's the

6004.679 --> 6010.1990000000005
only thing they're actually good at

6006.06 --> 6011.76
they're not really good at what they do

6010.199 --> 6015.54
that's the only thing they're really

6011.76 --> 6017.280000000001
good at is just making things worse

6015.54 --> 6019.739
they don't have

6017.28 --> 6021.389999999999
real government

6019.739 --> 6023.459999999999
skills

6021.39 --> 6025.92
[Music]

6023.46 --> 6028.699
only obstruction skills and making

6025.92 --> 6028.6990000000005
things worse

6037.619 --> 6043.5
what what do you mean good servant

6041.639 --> 6046.9800000000005
100 mile shot

6043.5 --> 6049.56
proves letter well that depends if it's

6046.98 --> 6050.759999999999
I guess it does in a way yeah and good

6049.56 --> 6054.06
point

6050.76 --> 6056.1
it was just me saying just to emphasize

6054.06 --> 6057.54
like being paranoid about super

6056.1 --> 6060.3
technology

6057.54 --> 6062.04
right it's complete waste of time dude

6060.3 --> 6064.320000000001
if there's World War III and you're

6062.04 --> 6067.56
gonna die you're gonna die

6064.32 --> 6070.259999999999
it's completely pointless to want to

6067.56 --> 6074.219
worry about that ahead of time yeah it's

6070.26 --> 6078.2390000000005
gonna be so so much out of control

6074.219 --> 6082.7390000000005
literally out of your hands are you

6078.239 --> 6085.5
going to engage in that war no then why

6082.739 --> 6088.159
worry about it there's nothing you can

6085.5 --> 6088.159
do about it

6089.96 --> 6095.46
[Music]

6092.88 --> 6098.34
unless you I don't want to enlist or

6095.46 --> 6099.84
something and be Canon father for AI

6098.34 --> 6104.04
turrets

6099.84 --> 6106.58
like AGM suggested

6104.04 --> 6106.58
something

6145.4 --> 6150.619
Republicans and Democrats are acting

6147.719 --> 6150.619
puppets period

6150.719 --> 6156.08
I don't know

6153.3 --> 6160.5
they're certainly acting like puppets

6156.08 --> 6160.5
that was a joke but

6161.58 --> 6166.44
like

6162.84 --> 6168.96
they're like two two masks of the same

6166.44 --> 6171.178999999999
Empire

6168.96 --> 6174.3
right in that sense they're just acting

6171.179 --> 6176.84
that's right they're just there to

6174.3 --> 6176.84
Act

6177.42 --> 6182.34
but there's still a difference somewhat

6180.119 --> 6184.92
although right now it seems to be just

6182.34 --> 6187.32
very little in between right

6184.92 --> 6189.6
so it it's different it's like a thing

6187.32 --> 6191.639
that just sometimes they get close

6189.6 --> 6194.900000000001
together sometimes they get very far

6191.639 --> 6194.900000000001
away from one another it's

6195.48 --> 6202.218999999999
it's not entirely consistent and in

6198.239 --> 6202.218999999999
other ways it's perfectly consistent

6224.699 --> 6232.28
Revelation oh sure sure why not

6229.44 --> 6232.28
why not

6242.58 --> 6246.719
right I mean well yeah they are putting

6245.1 --> 6248.6
up a front for the masses but it's

6246.719 --> 6250.8
already because the masses have already

6248.6 --> 6254.6990000000005
degenerated in their

6250.8 --> 6257.9400000000005
mental acuity so badly that they almost

6254.699 --> 6261.199
need to be fed some kind of narrative on

6257.94 --> 6261.199
that level to keep going

6262.02 --> 6267.540000000001
it's like

6264.48 --> 6270.299999999999
yeah they've been enslaved mentally and

6267.54 --> 6272.5199999999995
now they need slave masters to present

6270.3 --> 6275.400000000001
storytellers to keep them busy or

6272.52 --> 6278.639
they'll go insane and start ripping each

6275.4 --> 6280.379999999999
other apart in the slave cage right so

6278.639 --> 6284.3
yeah at that

6280.38 --> 6284.3
I get your point Amanda Young

6288.06 --> 6292.9800000000005
I'm glad I'm coming around well good

6290.46 --> 6296.28
servant look

6292.98 --> 6298.44
as a philosophical standpoint I'm not

6296.28 --> 6300.42
really going to evade that though

6298.44 --> 6301.619
because

6300.42 --> 6304.56
like

6301.619 --> 6307.86
it's kind of like a Quantum situation

6304.56 --> 6311.400000000001
like is it is Revelations happening

6307.86 --> 6314.219
because it was ordained or was it

6311.4 --> 6316.44
ordained to happen at some point and

6314.219 --> 6319.619
then at some point certain people came

6316.44 --> 6321.96
together said screw that we are the

6319.619 --> 6324.36
devil we're going to do that because

6321.96 --> 6326.219
yeah that seems like a good plan

6324.36 --> 6329.4
and we don't give a [ __ ] about anything

6326.219 --> 6333.54
right and that made it happen does that

6329.4 --> 6335.879999999999
mean that it is the ultimate prophecy or

6333.54 --> 6338.94
does it mean that it's like

6335.88 --> 6342.900000000001
a Kickstarter

6338.94 --> 6345.78
like a first attempt

6342.9 --> 6348.259999999999
that might carry very far

6345.78 --> 6348.259999999999
right

6349.199 --> 6353.5199999999995
we don't know

6351.48 --> 6356.0
we don't know

6353.52 --> 6356.0
like

6356.1 --> 6363.860000000001
even is it a natural pattern

6360.3 --> 6366.78
when if you people decide to do that

6363.86 --> 6369.0
will it typically always unfold like

6366.78 --> 6371.34
that is that a natural is it like an

6369.0 --> 6373.44
aberration is

6371.34 --> 6377.219
end of the world

6373.44 --> 6380.339999999999
situation as prophesized is that like an

6377.219 --> 6384.78
aberration that will always happen every

6380.34 --> 6387.56
single time is that what it is

6384.78 --> 6387.5599999999995
partly

6388.56 --> 6393.42
not a lark

6390.78 --> 6394.679
well maybe it's just a LARP turned live

6393.42 --> 6397.38
action

6394.679 --> 6400.5
right maybe a lot of people thought it

6397.38 --> 6403.88
was a LARP and then by doing it even as

6400.5 --> 6403.88
a LARP it turned real

6404.82 --> 6408.659
Maybe

6406.5 --> 6411.239
that's the thing that's happening it

6408.659 --> 6414.119
turning real instead of

6411.239 --> 6416.58
it was always going to be exactly that

6414.119 --> 6418.44
moment and it couldn't be stopped maybe

6416.58 --> 6421.04
it's the other way around maybe it's

6418.44 --> 6424.638999999999
just Lucifer the spirit of Lucifer

6421.04 --> 6427.0199999999995
versus ariman and Christ

6424.639 --> 6429.659000000001
seducing people until somebody got

6427.02 --> 6433.38
arrogant enough like okay let's do this

6429.659 --> 6435.659
and that then literally triggers

6433.38 --> 6439.1990000000005
the mechanism

6435.659 --> 6441.679
of what the prophecy talked about

6439.199 --> 6441.678999999999
right

6446.699 --> 6451.32
yeah that but that's a philosophical

6448.86 --> 6454.199
question I can't I can't force that upon
