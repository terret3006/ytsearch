today I went out for groceries

97.079 --> 102.0
earlier before the show but then it took

100.72 --> 104.15899999999999
a a little

102.0 --> 107.439
longer weather

104.159 --> 110.399
today is quite beautiful again couple of

107.439 --> 113.36
clouds cute little clouds it's mostly

110.399 --> 115.52
super blue sky the

113.36 --> 117.68
moon over

115.52 --> 122.24
there you see

117.68 --> 122.24000000000001
that no not yet it's right

123.399 --> 129.399
there probably be able to see it a bit

125.799 --> 134.04000000000002
later when it's a little bit more above

129.399 --> 134.04
funny how that works right sun is

138.92 --> 145.48
nice it's just great I like this weather

142.519 --> 148.04
you get a bit dry skin from

145.48 --> 150.92
it all

148.04 --> 153.48
right no new s has fallen that I've

150.92 --> 153.48
noticed

156.92 --> 160.92
but snow is still

161.4 --> 168.59900000000002
there right so it's Friday the 19th of

166.04 --> 168.599
January

177.8 --> 183.15900000000002
2024 temperatures 4Â° C right

185.68 --> 191.76000000000002
now gruning this by Sunday it's going to

188.4 --> 193.48000000000002
get warmer again and then rainy again

191.76 --> 195.92
goody

193.48 --> 198.67999999999998
H right but for now it's still going to

195.92 --> 198.67999999999998
be nice and

198.92 --> 202.76
sunny did enjoy

207.56 --> 213.48
that right so yeah I'm stuck up again

211.76 --> 215.439
cuz yeah I didn't have any food I had to

213.48 --> 219.07999999999998
get out for groceries and so I got an

215.439 --> 221.799
Illuminati croan as well cuz I am just

219.08 --> 221.799
really hungry

226.84 --> 232.68
today I feel so much

229.84 --> 234.64000000000001
better like the whole sensitiveness is

232.68 --> 237.72
all mostly

234.64 --> 240.27999999999997
gone like no more direct

237.72 --> 243.079
responses it's still all like

240.28 --> 245.519
bit like after shaking but that's like

243.079 --> 249.0
perfectly fine I actually feel very

245.519 --> 249.0
vibrant because of

249.68 --> 254.36
that shaking loose kind of

260.079 --> 264.0
feeling right so I actually watched back

262.44 --> 266.36
yesterday's

264.0 --> 269.32
show and it was much better than I

266.36 --> 271.32
thought it was but I did make like a

269.32 --> 273.44
pretty substantial mistake which was

271.32 --> 276.199
annoying I did notice it at that time

273.44 --> 278.56
and I thought that I had corrected it

276.199 --> 281.68
but I'm not like I listened back

278.56 --> 284.479
and it seemed like I corrected it but

281.68 --> 287.08
might not because I basically in my

284.479 --> 287.08
thorough

288.32 --> 293.8
explanation

290.68 --> 297.40000000000003
um about why the Earth is flat The

293.8 --> 300.16
Horizon I said that it was slightly Bel

297.4 --> 302.56
above ey level but it's supposed to be

300.16 --> 304.47900000000004
slightly below eye level was really

302.56 --> 306.44
weird I even explained it like yeah

304.479 --> 308.44
because you're right above the ground

306.44 --> 309.479
but I said it the wrong way around that

308.44 --> 313.12
was kind of

309.479 --> 315.44
weird very typical arnian mistake

313.12 --> 318.08
also it's very

315.44 --> 320.08
annoying when that happens I mean it

318.08 --> 323.28
happened plenty of times in the

320.08 --> 325.56
past right I want to do some kind of

323.28 --> 328.19899999999996
video like a perfect

325.56 --> 331.319
explanation I could record it live but

328.199 --> 334.319
I'll if I want it perfect I'll probably

331.319 --> 337.56
have to edit it because when I roll out

334.319 --> 340.6
things life sometimes I have this weird

337.56 --> 343.24
tendency like a very complex setup of

340.6 --> 345.28000000000003
explanations that are like really well

343.24 --> 348.68
but then internally here and there

345.28 --> 352.28
without noticing I flip things around by

348.68 --> 357.919
accident which is like a very stupid

352.28 --> 359.59999999999997
mistake but if you actually know it that

357.919 --> 363.35999999999996
field what I'm explaining you

359.6 --> 365.319
immediately recognize that so I've just

363.36 --> 367.52000000000004
come to regard it as like that's like a

365.319 --> 368.88
test within the Perfection to actually

367.52 --> 371.919
see if you know what the hell I'm

368.88 --> 375.199
talking about but I mean I I don't

371.919 --> 378.599
consciously intend to do

375.199 --> 381.68
that and it it does make me look stupid

378.599 --> 384.56
at least it does to me right but yeah I

381.68 --> 384.56
mean I make

384.919 --> 391.4
mistakes even like when I'm really good

387.8 --> 391.40000000000003
at something

391.44 --> 396.24
thank God I don't make mistakes like

393.08 --> 399.639
that with like motoric

396.24 --> 401.28000000000003
issues like I don't that's like why I've

399.639 --> 403.28000000000003
like never had an

401.28 --> 405.08
accident because I don't make those

403.28 --> 407.039
mistakes there thank God not in my

405.08 --> 411.4
motoric system

407.039 --> 415.52
but in my thinking and conversation

411.4 --> 415.52
explanation system yes it does

418.4 --> 421.4
happen

421.8 --> 428.44
and especially like when I reemerge from

425.08 --> 429.52
having a really bad time it typically

428.44 --> 432.44
pops

429.52 --> 434.599
up it's almost like a something that

432.44 --> 437.599
slips in when there's a lot of

434.599 --> 441.0
experience of Freedom or relief or

437.599 --> 444.919
release then it

441.0 --> 448.199
like just does that like a little fairy

444.919 --> 450.44
just popping up and just like turning

448.199 --> 452.879
something around

450.44 --> 455.36
and I don't notice it and it all seems

452.879 --> 457.56
perfectly fine or I do notice it and

455.36 --> 459.96000000000004
then I think I correct it but I don't

457.56 --> 462.12
it's weird so that's why I'm doing it

459.96 --> 463.0
now hello Richard G first in chat good

462.12 --> 467.24
to see

463.0 --> 467.24
you glad I'm feeling better yeah me

467.36 --> 471.039
too hope you're all

475.879 --> 481.24
good I got a coffee at the standby

479.36 --> 483.84000000000003
didn't drink it during the show

481.24 --> 486.96000000000004
yesterday I did have that coffee later

483.84 --> 490.28
though and it was a bit

486.96 --> 494.4
tough but it didn't like make me

490.28 --> 499.31899999999996
sick it just made it a little bit

494.4 --> 501.28
sour like yeah acidic bit more that

499.319 --> 504.159
wasn't like so I wasn't like eager to

501.28 --> 506.96
like oh yeah Chuck that down but took me

504.159 --> 509.84
quite a while but I mean from how I feel

506.96 --> 511.4
now I know that that issue will not be

509.84 --> 513.4399999999999
there like that like I will have no

511.4 --> 518.68
issue with that now if I'm going to take

513.44 --> 518.6800000000001
it so I'm just like yeah let's

520.039 --> 526.8389999999999
go and then yesterday night I also

523.72 --> 528.6
remembered PDQ B again this is kind of

526.839 --> 530.24
funny because om Benjamin brought that

528.6 --> 532.9590000000001
up a while

530.24 --> 535.279
back which was to me like absolutely

532.959 --> 537.4399999999999
amazing because that's like one of the

535.279 --> 538.2
few things that I really remember from

537.44 --> 539.7600000000001
my

538.2 --> 542.9200000000001
childhood

539.76 --> 546.3199999999999
cuz my mother was like super into

542.92 --> 549.5999999999999
music and she tried to make me into

546.32 --> 551.6400000000001
music too like she wanted me to

549.6 --> 553.88
basically like become a musician I just

551.64 --> 555.64
it never really hit off got a bit with

553.88 --> 558.92
the

555.64 --> 562.56
flute but then I like became just more

558.92 --> 562.56
interested with talking and

564.0 --> 569.48
reasoning and that's what I get got

567.6 --> 573.44
really focused on and like try to learn

569.48 --> 576.9200000000001
English really young like which is like

573.44 --> 580.1600000000001
pretty astounding like to learn like

576.92 --> 582.4399999999999
really enthusiastically start learning

580.16 --> 584.48
English when you're not even that good

582.44 --> 586.6
at it with at Dutch

584.48 --> 590.9590000000001
yet like at

586.6 --> 593.72
6 you're not like that's when in

590.959 --> 597.0
kindergarten supposed to

593.72 --> 598.12
learn really basic stuff and but I would

597.0 --> 601.16
just be

598.12 --> 602.64
watching some television and a lot of it

601.16 --> 605.6
would be English with Dutch subtitles

602.64 --> 605.6
and I would really try

605.72 --> 611.8000000000001
it wait is that

608.48 --> 615.76
six yeah but at six it was just a mess

611.8 --> 615.76
but I already knew like I like

617.32 --> 621.8000000000001
English and it's like it was so weird

619.88 --> 624.519
because there was so much I would

621.8 --> 626.04
understand about it even though I

624.519 --> 628.399
wouldn't literally understand what

626.04 --> 631.279
they're saying it's just like how it

628.399 --> 634.32
worked felt like this is

631.279 --> 636.959
something that's going to be mine that's

634.32 --> 640.2
what I felt about it right but anyway I

636.959 --> 641.3599999999999
also have memories related to that PDQ B

640.2 --> 645.6800000000001
even

641.36 --> 645.6800000000001
found I think this is probably

645.839 --> 654.519
like a a re-execution where they redo

651.16 --> 656.8389999999999
that but the very I had like this very

654.519 --> 660.44
specific cassette

656.839 --> 663.6800000000001
tape of PDQ

660.44 --> 668.6
yeah I have no idea where it is it's

663.68 --> 670.6389999999999
probably gone it was so old but this

668.6 --> 674.399
video

670.639 --> 677.76
has that like the very specific

674.399 --> 681.72
recording that I remember in there like

677.76 --> 684.279
most of it and I I knew with with

681.72 --> 686.72
certainty when I heard like the mish

684.279 --> 688.32
mash of like all these very famous

686.72 --> 689.8000000000001
classical themes that are like all

688.32 --> 691.6800000000001
crammed together

689.8 --> 694.1999999999999
sometimes like two or three at the same

691.68 --> 696.3599999999999
time that just like totally don't fit

694.2 --> 699.639
and are all super like familiar so it's

696.36 --> 702.44
really silly to but like that thing got

699.639 --> 705.12
me through some tough times when I was

702.44 --> 707.7600000000001
really young and

705.12 --> 710.639
because what I mentioned yesterday about

707.76 --> 714.079
like how it works with me like tension

710.639 --> 717.04
on the inside it's it's like this Dynamo

714.079 --> 719.56
this Millstone and it just keeps rolling

717.04 --> 723.04
and it it like it doesn't slow down

719.56 --> 726.8389999999999
really like it it can turn on and turn

723.04 --> 728.959
off like an engine but every time every

726.839 --> 731.72
day it's turned on which is literally

728.959 --> 733.3199999999999
every day because I am me if it wouldn't

731.72 --> 737.12
turn on I would have like total

733.32 --> 741.12
depressive collapse cuz it's like a

737.12 --> 744.519
metaphysical system of like how I

741.12 --> 749.04
run and it feels like it's this wheel

744.519 --> 750.8
like a like how a D um a gyroscope one

749.04 --> 754.3199999999999
of those that you can hold in your hand

750.8 --> 757.079
become so super rigid that it that force

754.32 --> 759.88
that pushes on you as you hold it stable

757.079 --> 762.68
and keep it rolling it's kind of feels

759.88 --> 764.32
like that but it's like in my

762.68 --> 766.56
neck

764.32 --> 770.32
spiritually sort of it's not that

766.56 --> 773.4399999999999
strenuous but it it has a

770.32 --> 775.24
similarity Sensational wise so it's like

773.44 --> 776.9590000000001
a little Sun you could also compare it

775.24 --> 781.199
to and I just

776.959 --> 784.68
like every day I start becoming actively

781.199 --> 788.76
conscious that thing starts up and every

784.68 --> 792.56
day it always goes a little bit faster

788.76 --> 797.4399999999999
but minute amounts

792.56 --> 799.5189999999999
and I can like push it to go faster but

797.44 --> 802.8000000000001
then I'll get exhausted and it'll roll

799.519 --> 805.16
back but whatever I do it goes a little

802.8 --> 807.279
bit faster every day and then eventually

805.16 --> 810.399
it's like I become

807.279 --> 812.56
overwhelmed by how fast it is like the

810.399 --> 815.48
pressure it just becomes pressure on you

812.56 --> 818.04
like the gyroscope is like so strong

815.48 --> 821.12
it's like it literally does like go on

818.04 --> 823.48
my muscles like it feels like I'm just

821.12 --> 827.5600000000001
trying to stabilize a gyroscope in my

823.48 --> 830.44
head and when that happens I get like

827.56 --> 834.079
really impressive

830.44 --> 837.2790000000001
results recognizing details being very

834.079 --> 840.16
accurate on average but also then I get

837.279 --> 843.639
like mega mega

840.16 --> 845.68
megalomaniacal streaks a bit they start

843.639 --> 848.199
to slip in because I'm like really

845.68 --> 850.56
impressed by how well I do things while

848.199 --> 854.3599999999999
that happens even though the strain is

850.56 --> 856.279
there and then I tend to like like what

854.36 --> 859.639
if I took a little more I explain it

856.279 --> 862.959
yeah and then chaos happens bad things

859.639 --> 865.5600000000001
happens and sometimes like it could even

862.959 --> 868.16
break and then it's

865.56 --> 870.04
like my stomach just gives and my

868.16 --> 872.079
stomach is almost like this pillar that

870.04 --> 875.16
it's actually standing on and then it's

872.079 --> 875.16
just and

875.92 --> 880.68
it and then it's like the gyroscope

878.72 --> 883.5600000000001
suddenly stuck in my stomach and just

880.68 --> 886.7199999999999
like making it throw up it's like you're

883.56 --> 886.7199999999999
not supposed to be

886.959 --> 893.3199999999999
there yeah and that's like then I have

890.8 --> 897.079
to let the cycle collapse and but the

893.32 --> 899.8000000000001
funny thing is funny it's terrible is

897.079 --> 903.88
that that process that making me throw

899.8 --> 907.04
up is literally driven and tied into

903.88 --> 910.04
thinking so while those 12 hours are

907.04 --> 913.3199999999999
there I'm continually like very

910.04 --> 915.88
fanatically trying to meditate emptying

913.32 --> 917.6
my mind and it's a real trick because

915.88 --> 920.399
you can empty it and still have a

917.6 --> 923.24
terrible feeling there if there's some

920.399 --> 926.279
kind of resemblance trace

923.24 --> 929.36
of whatever that's terrible so it's kind

926.279 --> 930.88
of tricky Jesus what kind of

929.36 --> 934.16
oh an ugly

930.88 --> 937.0
ad Jesus the freaking ad on my own

934.16 --> 940.0
channel threw me off that is so

937.0 --> 943.8
ugly get away from

940.0 --> 945.92
me hello Tommy by the

943.8 --> 950.199
way

945.92 --> 953.4399999999999
God thanks a lot YouTube your ugly ass

950.199 --> 953.4399999999999
ad just ruined my

954.36 --> 960.48
hangout

957.04 --> 963.8389999999999
uh was I talking about yeah

960.48 --> 967.36
it's the Dynamo that basically dropped

963.839 --> 970.0
down into my stomach is still driven by

967.36 --> 972.8000000000001
thought so if I'm like actively like I'm

970.0 --> 974.88
going to try to think my way out of this

972.8 --> 976.279
like I'm going to figure out an idea

974.88 --> 978.68
that's going to relieve me and going to

976.279 --> 981.12
make it stop well guess what happens

978.68 --> 984.279
with every attempt of thought it's like

981.12 --> 986.44
it pushes the Dynamo on again but it's

984.279 --> 990.16
in my stomach so I like immediately get

986.44 --> 991.9590000000001
sick from any thought any thought and

990.16 --> 993.6
then you could think like okay well I'm

991.959 --> 996.399
going to be sick no matter what so I

993.6 --> 1001.1990000000001
just keep doing it and like try to

996.399 --> 1003.399
ignore the sickness but then like yeah I

1001.199 --> 1005.88
just throw up anyway and it'll like

1003.399 --> 1008.6
throw off the thought so it's like a

1005.88 --> 1013.279
total broken situation like

1008.6 --> 1017.16
that but it's fascinating to realize

1013.279 --> 1020.24
like it's like a a Dynamo thing

1017.16 --> 1024.079
metaphysically spiritually

1020.24 --> 1026.079
and it is like the hand that you

1024.079 --> 1030.559
normally stabilize that with when you

1026.079 --> 1033.52
try to R spin it up that's my mind doing

1030.559 --> 1036.36
that my mind is the thing that's pushing

1033.52 --> 1038.039
it and as it's going faster it's like my

1036.36 --> 1041.0
mind also

1038.039 --> 1044.319
becomes more

1041.0 --> 1049.039
energized and more

1044.319 --> 1052.96
stable but then if it goes too hard

1049.039 --> 1056.919
it's like the grip within my yeah within

1052.96 --> 1058.72
my body position like it drops and so it

1056.919 --> 1060.76
goes right to my stomach and then it's

1058.72 --> 1063.96
like that's not the place you want to

1060.76 --> 1066.32
feel that energy I want to feel it here

1063.96 --> 1069.88
or here not

1066.32 --> 1073.9189999999999
there but every thought will then push

1069.88 --> 1076.0390000000002
it more so it's like empty your mind or

1073.919 --> 1080.039
it's literal

1076.039 --> 1082.32
hell yeah and that's a real trick but

1080.039 --> 1084.08
then when you focus on that then you get

1082.32 --> 1087.72
that dream state that I mentioned

1084.08 --> 1090.9189999999999
yesterday where it's like this white

1087.72 --> 1093.159
light and that thing is like it's

1090.919 --> 1095.24
completely thoughtless it's just like

1093.159 --> 1099.7600000000002
sensory it's just like this mythical

1095.24 --> 1103.32
sensory of like seeing a really dreamy

1099.76 --> 1106.28
scene like during a spring evening in a

1103.32 --> 1109.6
forest somewhere and you hear like

1106.28 --> 1111.76
something really like so energetically

1109.6 --> 1114.8799999999999
magical that it's like you feel the

1111.76 --> 1116.96
light and that feeling is like emulated

1114.88 --> 1119.4
within that dream state and it really

1116.96 --> 1121.679
show because it's like really bright in

1119.4 --> 1124.72
there in that inv visualization that

1121.679 --> 1128.039
encompasses it that

1124.72 --> 1130.96
state and that thing is like the only

1128.039 --> 1133.84
thing that can like actually help you

1130.96 --> 1136.679
completely ignore the stomach

1133.84 --> 1138.84
region and you're not thinking in there

1136.679 --> 1141.039
so it's not accidentally

1138.84 --> 1144.6399999999999
turning on the Dynamo again and that's

1141.039 --> 1144.64
the thing that's eventually

1145.96 --> 1154.559
like whoa I think it stopped it can take

1150.08 --> 1157.6399999999999
a while to get there anyway so an even

1154.559 --> 1160.44
more detailed explanation of that entire

1157.64 --> 1163.2800000000002
thing that's happening when I basically

1160.44 --> 1163.28
got the panic

1163.44 --> 1169.0
attack this a thanks stey traveler vomit

1167.84 --> 1171.9189999999999
Chronicle

1169.0 --> 1175.039
also no it's it's kind of like how I'm

1171.919 --> 1177.3200000000002
dealing with a panic attack and not to

1175.039 --> 1179.8799999999999
reference it back to the PDQ that I

1177.32 --> 1182.52
brought up when I was really young I had

1179.88 --> 1185.3200000000002
that too I would like spin up get really

1182.52 --> 1188.9189999999999
smart but then eventually I'd get like

1185.32 --> 1192.039
overworked and I'd get anxiety just like

1188.919 --> 1196.24
H it's too much

1192.039 --> 1198.44
and PDQ B that one thing where it's like

1196.24 --> 1202.1200000000001
continually routing the different

1198.44 --> 1205.919
familiar themes was a song that like if

1202.12 --> 1208.9189999999999
I listen to that I would stop

1205.919 --> 1211.919
panicking and it wouldn't get sick and

1208.919 --> 1215.2800000000002
I'd be like really happy and energetic

1211.919 --> 1216.72
again specifically that music and there

1215.28 --> 1218.6789999999999
was nothing else that did that

1216.72 --> 1222.2
everything else just made me like

1218.679 --> 1225.3200000000002
emotional or whatever and that thing is

1222.2 --> 1227.28
like is just like oh so much distraction

1225.32 --> 1229.2
and like oh I never recognize this or I

1227.28 --> 1230.84
recognize that

1229.2 --> 1232.52
and it's like yeah that's it's kind of

1230.84 --> 1234.039
funny but it's not like oh that's so

1232.52 --> 1235.96
ridiculous it's just like yeah there's

1234.039 --> 1239.2
something there oh something there oh oh

1235.96 --> 1241.52
and it was like great as a like an

1239.2 --> 1245.28
intellectual distraction in a time when

1241.52 --> 1248.28
you're like have a tendency to

1245.28 --> 1248.28
panic

1254.76 --> 1261.679
right okay hello Brianna Johnson

1259.28 --> 1264.96
I have to go to a meeting okay good for

1261.679 --> 1267.96

1264.96 --> 1267.96
C because I'm really

1268.039 --> 1273.2
hungry I think I might turn on my coffee

1273.44 --> 1278.72

1275.96 --> 1281.919
I'll be right back so yeah I just wanted

1278.72 --> 1284.039
to put that down and oh I don't not

1281.919 --> 1286.039
really appreciate you calling that the

1284.039 --> 1286.84
vomit Chronicles Ste traveler that that

1286.039 --> 1289.76
is

1286.84 --> 1293.72
like is is that the only thing to care

1289.76 --> 1297.1589999999999
about with this yeah I'm not like trying

1293.72 --> 1298.88
to gross you out yeah I'm trying to

1297.159 --> 1302.159
share with you the things that I'm

1298.88 --> 1305.0390000000002
learning about like a devastating

1302.159 --> 1307.3600000000001
repeating event in my life that some

1305.039 --> 1311.32
people might consider committing suicide

1307.36 --> 1314.08
over yeah and I'm trying to explain to

1311.32 --> 1315.799
you exactly how it works and how I'm

1314.08 --> 1319.72
dealing with it and how it is so

1315.799 --> 1322.1589999999999
incredibly tan and acceptable

1319.72 --> 1324.76
yeah that's why I'm doing this not to

1322.159 --> 1326.96
freaking gross you out i' kind of

1324.76 --> 1328.32
appreciate if you'd understood that

1326.96 --> 1332.799
steamie

1328.32 --> 1332.799
traveler anyway I'm be right

1346.96 --> 1349.96
back

1360.44 --> 1365.279
I'm literally

1362.039 --> 1368.64
instructing giving out things that are

1365.279 --> 1371.48
associated with that process that other

1368.64 --> 1372.679
people might experience to give them a

1371.48 --> 1377.0
better

1372.679 --> 1379.039
grip or somebody explaining what that is

1377.0 --> 1381.159
so that they might be able to reference

1379.039 --> 1383.4
this little video to other people when

1381.159 --> 1386.919
they try to explain how it works with

1383.4 --> 1388.24
them yeah because this is like a very

1386.919 --> 1390.679
misunderstood

1388.24 --> 1393.4
thing for a lot of like there's people

1390.679 --> 1395.799
out there that have no idea what this is

1393.4 --> 1397.4
like and then it's like wellow he go

1395.799 --> 1399.72
just like really sick and then you might

1397.4 --> 1402.039
think oh stomach flu some people call

1399.72 --> 1405.679
this like stomach flu yeah that was no

1402.039 --> 1408.559
freaking stomach flu absolutely not it

1405.679 --> 1410.72
was an unadulterated panic attack

1408.559 --> 1415.039
that's what it is should be classified

1410.72 --> 1417.799
as cuz it like it was ignited by the

1415.039 --> 1421.919
Panic the Panic made the standard

1417.799 --> 1424.8799999999999
shatter and the the actual position the

1421.919 --> 1429.0
actual apparent position of that energy

1424.88 --> 1432.1200000000001
Vortex that I used to re-empower my mind

1429.0 --> 1435.96
dropped down from

1432.12 --> 1439.0
here to there and here it's like pulling

1435.96 --> 1442.3600000000001
all the wrong strings with what it does

1439.0 --> 1442.36
so it's like this energy

1442.559 --> 1447.9189999999999
device dropped

1444.799 --> 1451.24
down and I'm like I'm just trying to

1447.919 --> 1453.0800000000002
explain the experience and other people

1451.24 --> 1456.24
might recognize it and I'm like telling

1453.08 --> 1458.039
them like hey you've experienced certain

1456.24 --> 1460.159
sickness and those people might like

1458.039 --> 1463.12
hate it so much they never want to ever

1460.159 --> 1464.6000000000001
think about it but what if you could

1463.12 --> 1468.6399999999999
deal with

1464.6 --> 1472.0
it like I'm dealing with it you know

1468.64 --> 1473.48
there's all because every time now I

1472.0 --> 1476.08
reference it's always like oh I'm going

1473.48 --> 1480.88
to be sick oh [Â __Â ] sick is so CL so

1476.08 --> 1484.799
[Â __Â ] up but after that I feel really

1480.88 --> 1488.72
rejuvenated like actually rejuvenated

1484.799 --> 1494.279
not oh I feel better again no reu I feel

1488.72 --> 1498.279
better like way better than before

1494.279 --> 1501.12
that cuz I just got slightly B walk down

1498.279 --> 1505.36
still fine and then that entire

1501.12 --> 1508.36
cataclysm process just it like breaks

1505.36 --> 1510.6399999999999
off all the the chattin all the shells

1508.36 --> 1512.6399999999999
everything that hardened off and it's

1510.64 --> 1515.72
like you're completely young again

1512.64 --> 1516.919
underneath that energetically it it's

1515.72 --> 1520.44
there

1516.919 --> 1523.0800000000002
so like this might be a mechanism that's

1520.44 --> 1526.679
even like as like

1523.08 --> 1531.12
there to keep you

1526.679 --> 1534.72
young yeah I don't see anything that

1531.12 --> 1536.9599999999998
happens as like this is just a fluke or

1534.72 --> 1536.96
a

1537.039 --> 1542.36
mutation I see everything has a function

1540.919 --> 1545.6000000000001
the only thing that doesn't have a

1542.36 --> 1547.7199999999998
function is something that's not there

1545.6 --> 1550.039
if you're missing something that's like

1547.72 --> 1551.96
a m a mutation is like you're missing

1550.039 --> 1554.32
something something that would be

1551.96 --> 1557.44
functional with others is not there with

1554.32 --> 1560.4399999999998
you that's less but if you have some

1557.44 --> 1563.3990000000001
Weir weird spasm thing or whatever or

1560.44 --> 1565.559
even like things like epilepsy I'm I'm

1563.399 --> 1567.559
just always wondering like what is that

1565.559 --> 1570.399
actually is there some kind of

1567.559 --> 1572.559
misunderstood function behind it like

1570.399 --> 1575.7199999999998
it's a certain sensory and if you don't

1572.559 --> 1577.8799999999999
really know how to deal with it then

1575.72 --> 1578.76
sometimes it goes haywire and screws up

1577.88 --> 1582.8400000000001
your

1578.76 --> 1585.24
system right but what if it was actually

1582.84 --> 1587.36
like a metaphys a spiritual tool that

1585.24 --> 1589.6
you could use once you realize what it

1587.36 --> 1589.6
is

1594.799 --> 1600.559
anyway oh okay steam yeah that okay

1597.6 --> 1604.6399999999999
that's poor timing than you but

1600.559 --> 1604.6399999999999
fine did I ban teret

1604.84 --> 1611.32
no duper

1607.36 --> 1614.52
hello no I did not ban teret but uh yeah

1611.32 --> 1617.08
after since that last conversation

1614.52 --> 1618.6
about like things in his homeland and

1617.08 --> 1621.1589999999999
all that

1618.6 --> 1624.0
like he he just

1621.159 --> 1627.48
got I don't

1624.0 --> 1629.72
know it seemed like I was just really

1627.48 --> 1632.44
try to be

1629.72 --> 1634.44
honest and I wanted a conversation I

1632.44 --> 1636.6000000000001
wanted him to I wanted to have it back

1634.44 --> 1639.159
and forth with him about these things

1636.6 --> 1641.84
that well may be potentially

1639.159 --> 1643.7990000000002
shameful from certain perspectives but I

1641.84 --> 1646.52
wanted to argue it with him but he

1643.799 --> 1649.52
couldn't do it he

1646.52 --> 1649.52
wouldn't

1651.64 --> 1653.919
like

1654.919 --> 1662.0
he there was a conflict with him that he

1658.159 --> 1664.159
was like denying that that's real and at

1662.0 --> 1668.0
the same time

1664.159 --> 1670.279
like I felt like he wanted to be honest

1668.0 --> 1673.32
about it that there might be some weird

1670.279 --> 1673.32
Pride there

1673.559 --> 1679.519
so but yeah he didn't come back after

1676.519 --> 1679.519
that

1683.039 --> 1688.1589999999999
so yeah maybe uh I don't know man I

1686.44 --> 1690.0
thought it was better stuff than that

1688.159 --> 1693.72
but it might turn out to be just a

1690.0 --> 1696.679
full-blown pajit now like exactly like

1693.72 --> 1698.2
what Owen Benjamin keeps talking about

1696.679 --> 1700.2
it it might be that he's just a

1698.2 --> 1704.88
full-blown pet

1700.2 --> 1709.44
now which is super tragic

1704.88 --> 1709.44
really but not for me for him

1714.519 --> 1718.72
Indians are very proud people yeah

1719.799 --> 1728.1589999999999
well that's tough man so I'm very proud

1723.88 --> 1731.159
too yeah but you got to actually deserve

1728.159 --> 1733.679
the pride because the pride that's like

1731.159 --> 1734.88
if you're not honest about things well

1733.679 --> 1736.159
there's a lot of things that are just

1734.88 --> 1738.919
going to trigger you then and you're

1736.159 --> 1742.0
going to be fleeing reality

1738.919 --> 1743.919
and uh that doesn't work yeah pride is a

1742.0 --> 1746.679
very

1743.919 --> 1749.919
tough thing to

1746.679 --> 1751.519
earn actual Pride that's like that

1749.919 --> 1753.519
people will agree to that's something

1751.519 --> 1755.72
you got to earn if you're just proud

1753.519 --> 1757.679
about something cuz you're delusional

1755.72 --> 1761.6000000000001
then nobody gives a [Â __Â ] they'll just

1757.679 --> 1764.3200000000002
call you delusional and

1761.6 --> 1766.799
prideful that doesn't get anybody

1764.32 --> 1768.6789999999999
respect that's like little kid [Â __Â ]

1766.799 --> 1771.8799999999999
little kids thinking they're heroes or

1768.679 --> 1774.679
whatever right it's [Â __Â ] no if you

1771.88 --> 1779.0
want to have real Pride then you better

1774.679 --> 1780.799
damn deal deal with what's real and then

1779.0 --> 1783.64
you deserve the

1780.799 --> 1787.08
pride

1783.64 --> 1789.48
yeah no return to the black you Mac you

1787.08 --> 1789.48
figure it

1796.32 --> 1799.32
out

1801.919 --> 1806.679
so yeah he failed the test he could have

1804.519 --> 1808.519
come back immediately I mean it's not

1806.679 --> 1810.6000000000001
like the first time I've ever tested him

1808.519 --> 1813.679
but

1810.6 --> 1818.6789999999999
y apparently has scared him off so badly

1813.679 --> 1818.679
that he just went straight to a

1818.84 --> 1826.24
[Â __Â ] because that's what that guy

1822.279 --> 1829.24
is who you've mentioned there steamy

1826.24 --> 1829.24
Traveler

1829.919 --> 1835.3200000000002
so apparently he's uh okay with that

1832.6 --> 1837.9599999999998
he's okay hanging around with

1835.32 --> 1840.32
[Â __Â ] you didn't hear the word I said

1837.96 --> 1843.08
yeah pajit is it apparently I don't even

1840.32 --> 1847.039
know lit this literally just copy pasted

1843.08 --> 1847.039
from Owen Benjamin's

1847.519 --> 1852.44
streams like that's what he was talking

1849.72 --> 1856.24
about vet

1852.44 --> 1859.24
week it's a lot of [Â __Â ] talking quite

1856.24 --> 1859.24
literally

1863.12 --> 1868.6789999999999
right and I was like act this sounds

1866.48 --> 1870.88
ridiculous but during that entire thing

1868.679 --> 1872.8400000000001
you know what I was doing and I feel

1870.88 --> 1875.279
kind of stupid now you know what I was

1872.84 --> 1880.72
doing I was in a freaking Rumble chat at

1875.279 --> 1882.76
Owen Benjamin literally defending Teran

1880.72 --> 1886.2
saying like I got an Indian guy and he's

1882.76 --> 1888.399
like he's not like that he's like he's

1886.2 --> 1890.48
got way better dis iine and he's like he

1888.399 --> 1893.36
knows honor and he's

1890.48 --> 1897.279
like he's not like that at

1893.36 --> 1899.4399999999998
all like I had to because I I wanted to

1897.279 --> 1902.519
defend my friend but apparently my

1899.44 --> 1906.1200000000001
friend oh is not so much my friend now

1902.519 --> 1908.519
apparently when his dream is

1906.12 --> 1910.4399999999998
destroyed you can't face the ugliest and

1908.519 --> 1913.24
now he's not my friend anymore so yeah

1910.44 --> 1916.44
that was [Â __Â ]

1913.24 --> 1917.84
lame now I feel really stupid having

1916.44 --> 1919.96
defended

1917.84 --> 1923.279
who I thought was my Indian friend that

1919.96 --> 1927.2
apparently I can't ask anything serious

1923.279 --> 1927.2
to that hits close to

1928.159 --> 1934.6390000000001
home it's very sad for him mostly but I

1932.32 --> 1934.639
feel

1942.08 --> 1945.08
embarrassed

1946.08 --> 1951.799
right

1948.0 --> 1951.799
it's a racial slur I'm sure it

1955.519 --> 1960.88
is Jamie is brain he's a freaking [Â __Â ]

1966.0 --> 1969.0
wizard

1971.0 --> 1976.6
yeah he's like the [Â __Â ] tank that when

1974.399 --> 1979.84
you feel like [Â __Â ] you just roll right

1976.6 --> 1979.84
in and and you're like

1980.799 --> 1986.519
yeah this is this is your bottom now I

1985.0 --> 1989.639
mean it

1986.519 --> 1991.48
is I don't like what the hell is he even

1989.639 --> 1994.559
brainwashing

1991.48 --> 1996.76
with it's kind of it's just that I was

1994.559 --> 1998.84
I'm annoyed by the entire premise of his

1996.76 --> 2002.84
videos because it's just the typical

1998.84 --> 2005.12
[Â __Â ] up troll [Â __Â ] with ugly ass lame

2002.84 --> 2005.12
G

2005.2 --> 2009.799
CGI and I hate that

2007.639 --> 2012.519
I like hate everything about that about

2009.799 --> 2016.1589999999999
the style about the people that do that

2012.519 --> 2018.36
I always do like I don't need to know

2016.159 --> 2020.3990000000001
anymore to know that I just [Â __Â ] hate

2018.36 --> 2022.6
him and no matter how much time or

2020.399 --> 2024.6789999999999
consideration I give that I will always

2022.6 --> 2027.639
end up hating that

2024.679 --> 2028.3990000000001
figure because that's how that works

2027.639 --> 2031.279
with

2028.399 --> 2034.7199999999998
me but I don't know what the hell he's

2031.279 --> 2037.24
even saying does he even have a message

2034.72 --> 2039.0
or is it just random stupid puppet and

2037.24 --> 2041.24
there's no meaning I don't know I

2039.0 --> 2043.32
haven't watched a video of this a single

2041.24 --> 2045.2
time because it's like one look at it

2043.32 --> 2048.359
just ah

2045.2 --> 2050.159
no I'd rather watch Sean Hawkins on

2048.359 --> 2053.159
camera talk for five

2050.159 --> 2053.159
minutes

2062.679 --> 2067.56
seriously all DND D players are nerds

2066.079 --> 2070.159
that live in their mother

2067.56 --> 2074.72
basement I have absolutely no problem

2070.159 --> 2077.0
with that can zoom Hof I've know quite a

2074.72 --> 2079.24
few nerds that actually did live in

2077.0 --> 2082.32
their mother's basement and they were

2079.24 --> 2085.4799999999996
awesome D and D

2082.32 --> 2086.3590000000004
guys just don't talk about improving

2085.48 --> 2089.76
their

2086.359 --> 2091.44
life right and hey in a way I was a bit

2089.76 --> 2095.7200000000003
like that never lived in my mom's

2091.44 --> 2099.64
basement but I mean I really didn't want

2095.72 --> 2099.64
to go away from home all that

2102.04 --> 2109.48
much like my mother had to die before I

2104.92 --> 2109.48
actually start to live on my own

2109.599 --> 2115.48
literally otherwise I'd probably still

2111.96 --> 2117.48
be there also because I wanted to also

2115.48 --> 2119.48
take care of my mom but yeah that didn't

2117.48 --> 2122.0
really work out now they

2119.48 --> 2125.079
did

2122.0 --> 2128.8
so and why insult people saying they are

2125.079 --> 2132.28
homosexual when you're yourself out that

2128.8 --> 2134.1600000000003
oh well because they are and if you're

2132.28 --> 2137.5600000000004
going to make a video that's like

2134.16 --> 2140.2
clearly sexualizing people in a way like

2137.56 --> 2143.72
that that's definitely bordering like

2140.2 --> 2148.2
fetish homosexual fetish type

2143.72 --> 2151.7999999999997
things then that does not equate to me

2148.2 --> 2155.16
way back in the past being confused

2151.8 --> 2157.04
about am I gay what the [Â __Â ] is that oh

2155.16 --> 2160.44
it's that you're like sexual with the

2157.04 --> 2163.2
man I'm like okay I'll test it I'll kiss

2160.44 --> 2164.92
that guy one time and I'll like pick a

2163.2 --> 2167.0789999999997
guy that is like really like a guy and

2164.92 --> 2169.28
then I'll just like figure well yeah

2167.079 --> 2172.1600000000003
that did not work and then I knew like

2169.28 --> 2174.8390000000004
okay well from a really neutral

2172.16 --> 2177.7599999999998
perspective yeah [Â __Â ] gross I know it

2174.839 --> 2180.319
was so gross I almost threw up from it

2177.76 --> 2182.7200000000003
yeah [Â __Â ] face

2180.319 --> 2184.52
[Â __Â ] thanks for bringing that up again

2182.72 --> 2188.72
you [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

2184.52 --> 2188.72
[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

2189.52 --> 2196.119
yeah but at least I don't make [Â __Â ]

2193.359 --> 2197.839
gay fetish videos about other people

2196.119 --> 2202.1600000000003
like a [Â __Â ]

2197.839 --> 2207.16
gross gay bar owner yeah that's what he

2202.16 --> 2210.16
is JC level freaking online gay bar

2207.16 --> 2210.16
owner

2211.48 --> 2218.28
yeah I'd say that's way worse than

2215.119 --> 2220.359
somebody once in their life being

2218.28 --> 2223.119
confused hanging around with a lot of

2220.359 --> 2225.92
people that are like not really good for

2223.119 --> 2228.839
him cuz they're all kind of marxist and

2225.92 --> 2231.64
[Â __Â ] in

2228.839 --> 2233.24
ways and then being all liberal and

2231.64 --> 2236.0789999999997
thinking like okay I'm just going to

2233.24 --> 2239.0789999999997
test it scientifically let's

2236.079 --> 2243.96
see if this is going to be enjoyable

2239.079 --> 2243.96
well no my body said

2245.16 --> 2252.0789999999997
no I'm sorry

2247.599 --> 2252.079
I'm sorry that is so disgusting to you I

2252.92 --> 2257.96
mean at least I don't hang around at

2255.88 --> 2262.0
online gay

2257.96 --> 2265.88
bars yeah Ken Zoom

2262.0 --> 2269.24
Hof and I will damn well call JC level a

2265.88 --> 2270.599
[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] because he knows what

2269.24 --> 2272.68
he's

2270.599 --> 2274.2400000000002
doing he's

2272.68 --> 2277.3999999999996
sexualizing

2274.24 --> 2281.24
men he's a [Â __Â ]

2277.4 --> 2284.319
[Â __Â ] that's a fact when you do that

2281.24 --> 2287.359
you are a [Â __Â ] you have homosexual

2284.319 --> 2289.319
fantasies that you project onto your

2287.359 --> 2293.16
media products that you want to share

2289.319 --> 2296.119
with the world you're a [Â __Â ] yeah

2293.16 --> 2298.48
kissing a guy once to check out if it

2296.119 --> 2301.839
does anything for you not so much a

2298.48 --> 2304.599
[Â __Â ] that's just exploring that's a

2301.839 --> 2307.44
bit liberal maybe I get it I'm I'm I

2304.599 --> 2311.839
would never do that now

2307.44 --> 2314.64
yeah I was young and stupid literally

2311.839 --> 2318.2
hanging around with bad people literally

2314.64 --> 2322.0
yeah after that point never

2318.2 --> 2323.9199999999996
again I knew then like okay no I have no

2322.0 --> 2327.52
more mystery about that

2323.92 --> 2330.16
now definitely not doing that

2327.52 --> 2333.839
again yeah not a

2330.16 --> 2336.8799999999997
[Â __Â ] it's called being

2333.839 --> 2340.2
empirical yeah and not oh I'm just so so

2336.88 --> 2342.7200000000003
scared of being seen like a homosexual

2340.2 --> 2343.5989999999997
no I was just like oh am I that or am I

2342.72 --> 2345.7599999999998
not

2343.599 --> 2349.56
that I don't know

2345.76 --> 2351.599
man like I had like admiring feelings

2349.56 --> 2354.56
for a men sometimes it's like whoa

2351.599 --> 2358.319
that's like a really cool

2354.56 --> 2359.92
dude like I really want to like work for

2358.319 --> 2362.4
him or something right that kind of

2359.92 --> 2362.4
feeling

2362.599 --> 2368.28
and I was just like I don't know what

2365.319 --> 2371.0
that is like all this talk about [Â __Â ]

2368.28 --> 2373.6400000000003
gay [Â __Â ] everywhere and me not being

2371.0 --> 2376.72
homophobic yet about it but like it was

2373.64 --> 2380.64
just all weird to me like I I was like

2376.72 --> 2383.0
mystified like why what is like how is

2380.64 --> 2383.0
this

2384.119 --> 2390.44
possible because for me being in love

2387.319 --> 2392.04
with women was absolutely natural like I

2390.44 --> 2394.2000000000003
fell in love with women when I was

2392.04 --> 2396.52
freaking five I still have the

2394.2 --> 2399.1189999999997
photographs to prove it you can

2396.52 --> 2401.72
literally provably see that I'm in love

2399.119 --> 2403.88
in that photograph when I was five with

2401.72 --> 2407.2799999999997
a girl with the girl right next to me

2403.88 --> 2410.28
being a barely realizing what's going on

2407.28 --> 2414.0400000000004
right cuz when I was five I was

2410.28 --> 2415.2000000000003
fantasizing I want to marry a girl and

2414.04 --> 2419.68
have

2415.2 --> 2421.1699999999996
babies that was when I was five yeah I'm

2419.68 --> 2424.2
very much

2421.17 --> 2427.04
[Music]

2424.2 --> 2429.16
heterosexual but yeah then you get

2427.04 --> 2431.04
drenched and surrounded by freaking gay

2429.16 --> 2433.48
and oh gay is Su special oh gay needs to

2431.04 --> 2435.56
be protected the media everywhere all

2433.48 --> 2436.52
that [Â __Â ] and I didn't like it I didn't

2435.56 --> 2439.2
like

2436.52 --> 2441.04
[Â __Â ] like they're really because it

2439.2 --> 2443.3999999999996
was like some people are homosexual and

2441.04 --> 2448.079
some are like really

2443.4 --> 2450.64
gross and just like uh and it just I I

2448.079 --> 2453.6800000000003
didn't understand it like what the [Â __Â ]

2450.64 --> 2456.16
is that crazy [Â __Â ] why is it always in

2453.68 --> 2458.2799999999997
your face everywhere in the media and

2456.16 --> 2461.0789999999997
like it's gotten much worse

2458.28 --> 2464.52
now and so I just

2461.079 --> 2468.8390000000004
like am I that

2464.52 --> 2470.72
yeah okay I just test it out one time I

2468.839 --> 2473.16

2470.72 --> 2476.2799999999997
party and like I don't know any of these

2473.16 --> 2479.319
people who gives a [Â __Â ] and I did that

2476.28 --> 2481.88
and like oh gross wow okay that was

2479.319 --> 2484.52
[Â __Â ] embarrassing like I felt really

2481.88 --> 2487.1600000000003
embarrassed like oh

2484.52 --> 2491.359
no immediately after after I did regret

2487.16 --> 2493.92
it yeah but it happened what are you

2491.359 --> 2498.96
going to do now I know empirically with

2493.92 --> 2498.96
certainty so yeah that's

2500.079 --> 2508.1600000000003
it it makes me well hey Ken zuroff why

2504.68 --> 2511.2799999999997

2511.28 --> 2513.48
I

2514.359 --> 2521.04
am I'm heterosexual ual and I like women

2519.2 --> 2525.359
a

2521.04 --> 2527.56
lot and sometimes thinking that I'm not

2525.359 --> 2530.56
so easy even to connect up with women

2527.56 --> 2534.24
because they're so freaking capable of

2530.56 --> 2535.96
hurting me because I love them so

2534.24 --> 2538.9599999999996
much

2535.96 --> 2542.8
yeah so why don't you go back to your

2538.96 --> 2548.16
online gay bar and go [Â __Â ] yourself

2542.8 --> 2548.1600000000003
okay I'm heterosexual now [Â __Â ] off

2549.0 --> 2555.319

ridiculous like that's that's all that

2555.319 --> 2560.88
it is anyway I'm going to get my coffee

2558.319 --> 2560.88
be right

2575.16 --> 2578.16
back

2618.0 --> 2622.559
right and to continue on there's actual

2620.64 --> 2627.7599999999998
lore about

2622.559 --> 2630.3590000000004
this yeah by curious yeah yeah caner M

2627.76 --> 2634.119
yeah that's literally what that was I

2630.359 --> 2636.7599999999998
was curious at the time guess what

2634.119 --> 2640.88
curiosity over

2636.76 --> 2643.28
was over one kiss over immediately like

2640.88 --> 2647.4
oh all that stuff that would have been

2643.28 --> 2649.599
yeah [Â __Â ] all that over one kiss over

2647.4 --> 2653.119
yeah not

2649.599 --> 2656.119
homosexual that's when you

2653.119 --> 2656.119
know

2656.96 --> 2663.0
okay right but I even know like where

2660.119 --> 2667.839
that came from that Curiosity because my

2663.0 --> 2670.839
love for women went so far so far

2667.839 --> 2670.839
that

2671.359 --> 2676.72
like it's like this GNA sounds strange

2674.88 --> 2678.839
it's good distraction for you since

2676.72 --> 2680.839
you're a bunch of freak [Â __Â ] hanging

2678.839 --> 2683.7599999999998
around here being all obsessed with this

2680.839 --> 2687.0
[Â __Â ] cuz you have no

2683.76 --> 2691.0400000000004
life right I do like I have more of a

2687.0 --> 2693.079
life than you guys nagging me about this

2691.04 --> 2694.96
I have actual experience that I find

2693.079 --> 2696.7200000000003
interesting that are cohesive and

2694.96 --> 2698.48
consistent

2696.72 --> 2700.7599999999998
yeah and there's a logic behind it and I

2698.48 --> 2702.839
learned things from it unlike you bunch

2700.76 --> 2704.3590000000004
of freaking online

2702.839 --> 2708.359
[Â __Â ]

2704.359 --> 2710.44
yeah I loved women so much that like I

2710.44 --> 2717.2000000000003
them not I want to be a woman no I

2714.2 --> 2720.2799999999997

bodies like I wanted my spirit in their

2720.28 --> 2723.559
body and they could have my

2724.48 --> 2731.119
body because I

2726.4 --> 2735.559
just wanted to feel everything so much

2731.119 --> 2739.1600000000003
and that like it's like a bit

2735.559 --> 2741.92
Overkill I don't really don't let myself

2739.16 --> 2744.48
go that much with love anymore because

2741.92 --> 2744.48

2744.88 --> 2750.599
dangerous but uh you are CH you no

2782.4 --> 2790.2400000000002

body very very very happy it is

2804.68 --> 2814.0789999999997
perfect I feel elated that God God gave

2809.16 --> 2818.0
me this body because it is

2814.079 --> 2819.44
perfect it's the best best you can get

2818.0 --> 2822.0
out of this

2819.44 --> 2825.16
combination yeah and I'm very happy with

2822.0 --> 2827.48
it definitely don't think I was born in

2825.16 --> 2831.839
the wrong body

2827.48 --> 2833.72
yeah I just got really so obsessed with

2831.839 --> 2835.16
women and how they feel that it's like I

2833.72 --> 2838.5589999999997
want it to be

2835.16 --> 2842.2
them and so I would like sympathize

2838.559 --> 2847.7200000000003
strongly with female and I in ways like

2842.2 --> 2847.72
weirdly taken over some traits of them

2848.28 --> 2850.559
it's

2850.92 --> 2856.359
weird and

2853.559 --> 2859.559
tough because it's like I got a pretty

2856.359 --> 2863.5589999999997
weird combination of personality traits

2859.559 --> 2866.6800000000003
like that I'm trying to work it out

2863.559 --> 2869.8390000000004
man but uh yeah definitely a man it's

2866.68 --> 2871.48
more like I'm a man and I have some

2869.839 --> 2876.119
weird

2871.48 --> 2877.079
female like spiritual or social traits

2876.119 --> 2881.4
in

2877.079 --> 2884.2000000000003

you're a dumb [Â __Â ] kzone off that's why

3144.319 --> 3150.079

3150.079 --> 3156.799
a group as a project as a set of

3153.559 --> 3159.119
argumentations that's why he does that

let let's

3375.76 --> 3380.7200000000003
see how deep this [Â __Â ] hole goes with

3378.44 --> 3380.7200000000003
this

3381.86 --> 3386.92
[Music]

3383.92 --> 3386.92
guy

3390.96 --> 3395.2400000000002
hey Steven

3392.68 --> 3399.7599999999998
Jarvis who are we talking to whoever's

3395.24 --> 3399.7599999999998
listening and feels that I'm talking to

3403.44 --> 3408.7200000000003
them yeah I mean when I present

3406.559 --> 3411.039
something like that you're dealing with

3408.72 --> 3415.7599999999998
a you're either you're with me or you're

3411.039 --> 3418.76
against me Paradigm so pick a side

3415.76 --> 3420.76
yeah either you accept the way that I do

3418.76 --> 3422.8390000000004
my show or you

3420.76 --> 3425.0
don't I know you're probably going to

3422.839 --> 3426.48
end up nagging and whining about it and

3425.0 --> 3429.319
then I'm going to kick you

3426.48 --> 3434.359
out and probably end up blocking you if

3429.319 --> 3434.359
you keep whining to my face everywhere I

3443.799 --> 3446.799
go

3451.68 --> 3456.68
hey Kum

3453.68 --> 3458.8799999999997
virus and yeah see you later Return of

3456.68 --> 3458.8799999999997
the

3464.16 --> 3469.1189999999997
Mac yeah that's right ker Hof

3471.28 --> 3478.28
yeah it's not just a flatter evidence

3475.48 --> 3480.92
it's like a a geometry evidence in

3478.28 --> 3484.119
general like the existential

3480.92 --> 3484.119
consequences are

3484.799 --> 3491.44
staggering you literally would be

3488.359 --> 3494.4
incapable of creating a Celestial

3491.44 --> 3497.559
navigation system that would be reliable

3494.4 --> 3501.039
if the Earth had been a

3497.559 --> 3501.039
globe and that's

3503.72 --> 3508.64
fascinating

3505.4 --> 3511.7200000000003
I haven't even like addressed further

3508.64 --> 3514.8799999999997
things like elevation how much that

3511.72 --> 3517.52
matters right I told you yesterday very

3514.88 --> 3520.319
emphasized how the angles of the

3517.52 --> 3523.0389999999998
celestial demiere that you might see

3520.319 --> 3525.359
literally are identically around you

3523.039 --> 3527.44
identical they don't change as you go up

3525.359 --> 3532.5589999999997
even if you go up with a

3527.44 --> 3534.88
rocket it's like this lamp shade of

3532.559 --> 3536.92
Lights is just there apparently and it

3534.88 --> 3539.319
will follow you exactly as you go

3536.92 --> 3541.92
straight up it will be identical okay

3539.319 --> 3544.96
that's magical that's really

3541.92 --> 3547.96
weird especially that no new stars

3544.96 --> 3550.28
appear below you then no because it's

3547.96 --> 3553.68
yeah Horizon is not geometric it's

3550.28 --> 3555.28
slightly below eye level not above I

3553.68 --> 3558.52
said it wrong yesterday it's slightly

3555.28 --> 3560.559
below eye level but here's the thing if

3558.52 --> 3564.4
you're really high up and then you're

3560.559 --> 3567.599
going to travel a very specific distance

3564.4 --> 3569.6800000000003
guess how much much the celestial sphere

3567.599 --> 3573.28
rotates over that

3569.68 --> 3575.7599999999998
distance guess Richard I know you can

3573.28 --> 3575.76
get this

3583.76 --> 3591.079
right how much rotation of the celestial

3588.599 --> 3595.7200000000003
sphere difference is

3591.079 --> 3599.28
there when you travel high up

3595.72 --> 3599.2799999999997
as when you travel rather

3609.799 --> 3614.48
low that's

3611.88 --> 3617.96
right that's

3614.48 --> 3620.44
right celestial sphere exactly the same

3617.96 --> 3623.559
amount of rotation over exactly the same

3620.44 --> 3626.88
distance at any

3623.559 --> 3630.3190000000004
height how is that supposed to work on a

3626.88 --> 3632.599
sphere I thought that the further down

3630.319 --> 3635.079
you go the closer you get to the sphere

3632.599 --> 3637.839
and a further way you go you get

3635.079 --> 3640.2000000000003
basically layers on layers on layers on

3637.839 --> 3642.52
the sphere and so then that same

3640.2 --> 3646.3999999999996
distance over that

3642.52 --> 3648.319
sphere would be like a lot more so if

3646.4 --> 3651.039
you literally travel the same distance

3648.319 --> 3653.48
at that hide over a sphere

3651.039 --> 3655.88
then the celestial sphere that you're

3653.48 --> 3660.72
seeing around you

3655.88 --> 3662.96
should be moving way slower and over the

3660.72 --> 3664.319
actual distance that you travel at very

3662.96 --> 3668.039
high

3664.319 --> 3672.319
altitudes you would effectively travel

3668.039 --> 3674.0
less over land because you're high up on

3672.319 --> 3677.0389999999998
a

3674.0 --> 3679.2
sphere but in reality when you go up

3677.039 --> 3681.7200000000003
really high and you travel the exact

3679.2 --> 3684.24
same distance

3681.72 --> 3688.9199999999996
horizontally there is no difference as

3684.24 --> 3688.9199999999996
when you would travel driving over the

3688.96 --> 3696.119
ground no difference in celestial sphere

3691.76 --> 3698.96
rotation amount nothing why because the

3696.119 --> 3701.28
Earth is flat and

3698.96 --> 3703.52
every

3701.28 --> 3708.119
horizontal above the

3703.52 --> 3710.799
ground is parallel to every other

3708.119 --> 3713.44
horizontal over the ground everywhere

3710.799 --> 3715.92
else that's why because the Earth is

3713.44 --> 3718.44
flat and that's why there is no

3715.92 --> 3722.039
difference in celestial sphere rotation

3718.44 --> 3724.839
around you when you move a distance at a

3722.039 --> 3727.3190000000004
great height it's exactly the same

3724.839 --> 3730.0
amount of

3727.319 --> 3732.799
rotation apparent rotation of the parent

3730.0 --> 3734.68
celestial sphere because the Earth is

3732.799 --> 3738.119
flat on the

3734.68 --> 3741.16
sphere distances traveled at Great

3738.119 --> 3743.2400000000002
altitude would be have to be a lot more

3741.16 --> 3745.64
to achieve the same effective distance

3743.24 --> 3749.839
at the ground

3745.64 --> 3754.0
and the celestial sphere would rotate

3749.839 --> 3756.72
less over distance travel but the amount

3754.0 --> 3760.76
of rotations it travels over distance is

3756.72 --> 3762.4399999999996
exactly the same at any height because

3760.76 --> 3766.44
the Earth is

3762.44 --> 3769.079
flat and every horizontal over the

3766.44 --> 3771.68
ground and the ocean is perfectly

3769.079 --> 3774.4
parallel to every other

3771.68 --> 3776.96
horizontal over the ground and the ocean

3774.4 --> 3779.279
everywhere else on Earth cuz the Earth

3776.96 --> 3779.279
is

3803.279 --> 3806.279
flat

3813.44 --> 3820.599
firmament yeah I don't know I didn't did

3816.4 --> 3820.599
I involve any firmament in

3820.72 --> 3828.0789999999997
this the druish thewish

3825.52 --> 3832.16
Bible yeah I I'm sorry did I use the

3828.079 --> 3835.48
word firmament anywhere I'm just talking

3832.16 --> 3839.5589999999997
about the celestial lights the

3835.48 --> 3843.2400000000002
apparent apparent celestial sphere all

3839.559 --> 3845.559
the stars we see like that thing that we

3843.24 --> 3848.4399999999996
use in Celestial navigation right the

3845.559 --> 3853.0
Stars how they appear to us in a in a

3848.44 --> 3853.0
Demis spere at the edge of our

3860.88 --> 3866.88
vision yeah that's like yeah can zoom

3863.96 --> 3869.559
off that's that's

3866.88 --> 3873.319
right I mean you could you if you could

3869.559 --> 3875.119
demonstrate how you do that just show me

3873.319 --> 3877.599
how you're taking an elevation angle

3875.119 --> 3882.48
from a sphere then just do it then show

3877.599 --> 3885.6800000000003
it how you do that yeah get a a 3D

3882.48 --> 3885.68
program an

3885.96 --> 3890.119
animator it's like a measuring tools in

3888.4 --> 3893.92
there and and just show how you're doing

3890.119 --> 3896.319
that show how how the computer then does

3893.92 --> 3899.2000000000003
it for you right these kind of things

3896.319 --> 3901.88
could be difficult there's a lot of

3899.2 --> 3905.279
automated measuring program things for

3901.88 --> 3908.0
that just do it take that elevation

3905.279 --> 3912.72
angle from the sphere then do

3908.0 --> 3916.119
it show it show it on a

3912.72 --> 3917.839
video with GE however you want to do it

3916.119 --> 3921.92
man just

3917.839 --> 3924.16
show the computer calculating for you

3921.92 --> 3927.88
the elevation angle from the surface

3924.16 --> 3929.96
surface of a sphere show it show how you

3927.88 --> 3932.359
do that on your computer with the

3929.96 --> 3934.76
program that can do that there's there's

3932.359 --> 3937.48
there out there it's easy

3934.76 --> 3941.119
stuff can probably get it for

3937.48 --> 3944.72
free yeah just do it show then how how

3941.119 --> 3947.039
you're doing that or manually calculate

3944.72 --> 3951.319
if you will just do

3947.039 --> 3956.079
it yeah you will oh yeah good luck see

3951.319 --> 3956.079
you in 10 years maybe

3958.48 --> 3962.559
or hopefully

3959.799 --> 3966.68
never the questions you ented this chat

3962.559 --> 3966.6800000000003
with I don't really need to see you

3966.92 --> 3969.92
again

3971.119 --> 3978.2000000000003
right and definitely not coming back

3973.839 --> 3981.319
though with the Visual Evidence of how

3978.2 --> 3983.4399999999996
you calculate the elevation angle to

3981.319 --> 3985.2
that spherical surface you're definitely

3983.44 --> 3988.799
not going to come back with that because

3985.2 --> 3992.5589999999997
it's impossible to do that and that is

3988.799 --> 3996.48
the point you can't take an elevation

3992.559 --> 3998.0
angle from a curved surface it's

3996.48 --> 3999.96
mathematically

3998.0 --> 4002.319
impossible it

3999.96 --> 4004.359
violates the conditions of what an

4002.319 --> 4009.119
elevation angle

4004.359 --> 4010.68
is you can only take an elevation angle

4009.119 --> 4013.76
from a flat

4010.68 --> 4017.279
surface oh why did they have why did

4013.76 --> 4019.1600000000003
they make us take an elevation angle no

4017.279 --> 4022.359
no yeah well they they didn't give a

4019.16 --> 4024.279
[Â __Â ] about your stupid Globe faith yet

4022.359 --> 4026.319
when they devised that technique that

4024.279 --> 4029.16
allowed them to literally explore the

4026.319 --> 4030.44
entire world thousands of years ago yeah

4029.16 --> 4032.7599999999998
they didn't give a [Â __Â ] about your

4030.44 --> 4035.799
[Â __Â ] Globe belief you see they just

4032.76 --> 4038.76
used the technique that worked

4035.799 --> 4040.7599999999998
immediately and consistently and it

4038.76 --> 4044.2000000000003
could be explained across language

4040.76 --> 4046.119
barriers and culture barriers yeah they

4044.2 --> 4051.16
just did what

4046.119 --> 4054.119
worked elevation angle to the

4051.16 --> 4056.48
star on a flat Earth cuz the Earth is

4054.119 --> 4058.52
flat oh calm down I can do whatever the

4056.48 --> 4060.88
[Â __Â ] I want dude shut the [Â __Â ] up don't

4058.52 --> 4062.079
[Â __Â ] tell me to calm down [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

4060.88 --> 4066.1600000000003
get the [Â __Â ]

4062.079 --> 4070.279
out I can talk [Â __Â ] however much I want

4066.16 --> 4070.279
if I want to curse I will go [Â __Â ]

4072.92 --> 4075.92
yourself

4084.16 --> 4089.48
can you go [Â __Â ] your link you make a

4087.2 --> 4092.1189999999997
video and you demonstrated in that I'm

4089.48 --> 4094.359
not going to [Â __Â ] do your stupid math

4092.119 --> 4096.6
program to prove something that I

4094.359 --> 4098.799
already know is impossible yeah you

4096.6 --> 4099.759
can't take an elevation angle from a

4098.799 --> 4103.56
curved

4099.759 --> 4107.319
surface it's not possible it violates

4103.56 --> 4109.0
the conditions required to establish an

4107.319 --> 4112.4400000000005
elevation

4109.0 --> 4115.48
angle it will give you an

4112.44 --> 4122.159
error yeah I already know this I don't

4115.48 --> 4122.159
need to do the program for you you lazy

4123.64 --> 4130.4400000000005
[Â __Â ] you do it and you demonstrate to

4127.56 --> 4132.799
you that rinn's right and that it

4130.44 --> 4135.799
doesn't

4132.799 --> 4135.799
work

4143.199 --> 4148.0
was done on cat you're a [Â __Â ] liar at

4144.96 --> 4150.199
kumu virus you can't do it on CAD I'm

4148.0 --> 4153.359
GNA time you out for that big time

4150.199 --> 4157.4
you're a [Â __Â ] liar

4153.359 --> 4160.04
scumbag lying about math absolutely

4157.4 --> 4165.719
repulsive should be ashamed of yourself

4160.04 --> 4165.719
Akuma virus ashamed deeply ashamed

4165.759 --> 4173.759
self-proclaimed mathematics specialist

4168.56 --> 4173.759
you're a [Â __Â ] dirty dirty dirty

4174.759 --> 4183.359
liar absolutely not done in AutoCat you

4178.4 --> 4183.3589999999995
dirty dirty dirty liar Akuma

4191.759 --> 4198.28
virus yeah send it to my email them

4195.4 --> 4202.08
[Â __Â ] I'll share it with the guys so

4198.28 --> 4202.08
they can laugh over how stupid you

4211.679 --> 4217.679
are G

4214.92 --> 4219.56
gabra that

4217.679 --> 4222.28
sounds

4219.56 --> 4224.84
ridiculous but yeah you can just Bluff

4222.28 --> 4227.28
it all you want I know you don't have it

4224.84 --> 4229.12
it's physically impossible this should

4227.28 --> 4231.32
be funny now it's ridiculous he's just

4229.12 --> 4233.44
wasting everybody's time he's just like

4231.32 --> 4236.88
trying to roll out the confidence scheme

4233.44 --> 4238.96
right now that there is something I know

4236.88 --> 4244.2390000000005
it's

4238.96 --> 4248.52
impossible it's like oh just just solve

4244.239 --> 4251.159
this Paradox like yeah you can't it's a

4248.52 --> 4253.96
paradox oh but I can solve it I'll just

4251.159 --> 4256.879999999999
do this I I'll show it to you oh I'm

4253.96 --> 4260.84
going to do it right now no it's [Â __Â ]

4256.88 --> 4264.08
impossible idiot that's the whole point

4260.84 --> 4267.12
you can claim that you could do it it's

4264.08 --> 4270.36
impossible it violates the base

4267.12 --> 4272.4
conditions for it the elevation angle

4270.36 --> 4276.159
itself you can't do it on a curved

4272.4 --> 4279.96
surface there is nothing that allows you

4276.159 --> 4283.12
ever to do it off a curved surface it's

4279.96 --> 4286.92
the point there's nothing you can do

4283.12 --> 4291.44
about it it's just it doesn't work like

4286.92 --> 4291.4400000000005
that can prove the impossible that's

4293.52 --> 4297.56
right go [Â __Â ] yourself

4302.36 --> 4308.839999999999
[Â __Â ] Bunch are so dumb so [Â __Â ] dumb

4306.52 --> 4308.84
it's

4312.56 --> 4315.56
unbelievable

4322.6 --> 4328.679
the level of stupidity among you people

4324.88 --> 4334.12
with your idiocy here unwillingness to

4328.679 --> 4334.12
face blatant reality is shameful as

4335.44 --> 4341.0
hell I mean seriously at this like this

4338.52 --> 4344.2390000000005
level of stupidity it's like worse than

4341.0 --> 4347.719
[Â __Â ] eating yeah you're worse than [Â __Â ]

4344.239 --> 4351.199
eaters with what you believe what you do

4347.719 --> 4354.639
to try to enforce that belief you are

4351.199 --> 4356.759999999999
worse you're worse than that it's so

4354.639 --> 4358.639
[Â __Â ] embarrassing it's so

4356.76 --> 4360.12
embarrassing most people like they don't

4358.639 --> 4362.679
even want to

4360.12 --> 4364.84
look they just pretend it doesn't exist

4362.679 --> 4366.32
and hey it's a bit easier right because

4364.84 --> 4368.2390000000005
if you just don't listen to [Â __Â ]

4366.32 --> 4372.04
ballards in their lies all the time and

4368.239 --> 4373.44
their delusion well it's not like you're

4372.04 --> 4376.56
looking around and you're literally see

4373.44 --> 4379.199
seeing somebody shove [Â __Â ] in their face

4376.56 --> 4380.679
right so you can effectively pretend

4379.199 --> 4382.239
like they don't exist they'll just

4380.679 --> 4383.76
surround you everywhere though and you

4382.239 --> 4386.839999999999
can't have a conversation anymore

4383.76 --> 4389.92
without them trying to push their horse

4386.84 --> 4394.1990000000005
[Â __Â ] on you metaphysically with globe

4389.92 --> 4397.08
nonsense right but yeah I I think that

4394.199 --> 4401.04
you globers out there are literally

4397.08 --> 4405.4
dumber and worse societally worse than

4401.04 --> 4408.679
[Â __Â ] eaters it's so [Â __Â ] pathetic how

4405.4 --> 4411.44
you lie about

4408.679 --> 4415.88
blatantly impossible

4411.44 --> 4418.839999999999
things like no now you did not make a

4415.88 --> 4421.4400000000005
[Â __Â ] little video about how you took

4418.84 --> 4425.1990000000005
an elevation angle from a curved surface

4421.44 --> 4428.4
with some stupid program because it's

4425.199 --> 4431.4
physically impossible it's

4428.4 --> 4434.48
mathematically impossible it

4431.4 --> 4436.96
violates the condition

4434.48 --> 4439.678999999999
for the elevation

4436.96 --> 4442.2390000000005
angle if you attempt to take an

4439.679 --> 4444.56
elevation angle of a curve surface in

4442.239 --> 4448.959999999999
any mathematical program it will tell

4444.56 --> 4452.280000000001
you error you can't do

4448.96 --> 4457.2390000000005
that you can only take an elevation

4452.28 --> 4457.239
angle from a flat

4458.12 --> 4464.599999999999
surface that's the

4461.239 --> 4467.4
condition that's just how it

4464.6 --> 4469.76
is I'm sure you want to attempt to

4467.4 --> 4472.32
completely rearrange the meaning of

4469.76 --> 4477.8
words and their atmology and everything

4472.32 --> 4479.639
to try to undo that hardcore basic fact

4477.8 --> 4481.6
but it's the way it is that's what they

4479.639 --> 4483.92
use the elevation angle it's still there

4481.6 --> 4487.52
in all the manuals all the old manuals

4483.92 --> 4490.719
all the newer manuals yeah even before

4487.52 --> 4493.120000000001
[Â __Â ] bubble SE were even a thing the

4490.719 --> 4496.6
elevation angle was always there it's

4493.12 --> 4496.599999999999
the the foundational

4496.639 --> 4503.639
part yeah Earth is flat was always flat

4502.0 --> 4505.56
and in the beginning when they figured

4503.639 --> 4510.1990000000005
out Celestial navigation they didn't

4505.56 --> 4510.1990000000005
give a [Â __Â ] about your [Â __Â ] Globe

4515.199 --> 4521.36
belief a this is going to be [Â __Â ] okay

4519.08 --> 4523.76
okay [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] I'm going to I'm

4521.36 --> 4526.239
going to actually check that out it's

4523.76 --> 4529.8
going to be too [Â __Â ] for

4526.239 --> 4529.799999999999
belief I'll do it

4532.04 --> 4535.6
anyway uh

4552.199 --> 4556.678999999999
what recording

4557.48 --> 4561.28
unlisted no

4561.96 --> 4567.32
[Â __Â ] you're literally doing it on a

4564.4 --> 4568.839999999999
flat plane you [Â __Â ] you're not using the

4567.32 --> 4571.719
Horizon

4568.84 --> 4576.56
[Â __Â ] people are too

4571.719 --> 4576.56
[Â __Â ] you're so [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

4576.6 --> 4582.120000000001
dude unbelievable I can't believe you

4579.52 --> 4584.040000000001
actually did

4582.12 --> 4585.639
that

4584.04 --> 4588.96
just

4585.639 --> 4591.8
monstrously embarrassing I'll post your

4588.96 --> 4591.8
shitty ass

4592.0 --> 4596.28
link you people are the

4608.719 --> 4614.36
worst about to get a yeah but I'm not

4611.239 --> 4616.959999999999
aing him I'm not throwing up out because

4614.36 --> 4619.32
he said too much [Â __Â ] and I want don't

4616.96 --> 4619.32
want it

4620.08 --> 4625.4
deleted because go [Â __Â ] yourself [Â __Â ]

4623.28 --> 4628.159
shut your [Â __Â ] mouth stop talking to

4625.4 --> 4628.159
me [Â __Â ]

4642.0 --> 4645.0
face

4647.32 --> 4650.679
did you put my voice I don't know I

4648.96 --> 4653.159
haven't listened to the video I know

4650.679 --> 4655.36
that that's his shitty link and he

4653.159 --> 4659.239
actually yeah that video proves the GL

4655.36 --> 4659.239
yeah I know it's so [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

4660.08 --> 4666.32
unbelievable you are like Beyond

4663.48 --> 4668.759999999999
reproach your idiocy like there's only

4666.32 --> 4670.44
one place there's only one place for

4668.76 --> 4672.56
that level of delusion and that's the

4670.44 --> 4675.36
[Â __Â ] Abyss dude if you're that

4672.56 --> 4676.88
[Â __Â ] stupid then you will go to the

4675.36 --> 4679.88
abyss after you

4676.88 --> 4679.88
die

4681.76 --> 4686.8
yeah but I mean you probably don't

4684.6 --> 4689.96
believe right that the entire point of

4686.8 --> 4693.159000000001
life is trying to figure out what's real

4689.96 --> 4695.719
and if you if you find yourself in the

4693.159 --> 4699.239
in full delusion at the end of your

4695.719 --> 4701.6
life that you might not really deserve

4699.239 --> 4701.599999999999
another

4701.92 --> 4704.92
shot

4705.36 --> 4712.12
because you for personal reasons

4710.159 --> 4715.239
rejected

4712.12 --> 4718.199
reality you thought you knew better

4715.239 --> 4720.44
right like

4718.199 --> 4722.0
Lucifer your reality is better the

4720.44 --> 4723.919999999999
Inside Out reality is better yeah it

4722.0 --> 4727.0
isn't it's a

4723.92 --> 4729.2390000000005
trap if you fully buy it by the end

4727.0 --> 4730.76
you're that you're dying if you still

4729.239 --> 4734.919999999999
hold on to it as you're dying you're

4730.76 --> 4734.92
going to go to the abyss

4735.679 --> 4740.8
but I mean most people do actually at

4738.08 --> 4744.32
the very very last moment

4740.8 --> 4746.639
repent cuz God is just like

4744.32 --> 4748.599999999999
that I really think that if you're like

4746.639 --> 4749.96
that all your life you should literally

4748.6 --> 4752.4800000000005
go to

4749.96 --> 4754.2390000000005
hell but God like forgives them in the

4752.48 --> 4755.718999999999
last moment and then they see it all and

4754.239 --> 4757.28
then they're like why did I do that all

4755.719 --> 4760.159
my life and then I'm like yeah just

4757.28 --> 4763.92
[Â __Â ] die already shut the [Â __Â ]

4760.159 --> 4765.36
up you [Â __Â ] nag

4763.92 --> 4769.4800000000005
nagging

4765.36 --> 4773.5199999999995
people decades with your [Â __Â ] whining

4769.48 --> 4777.879999999999
being wrong not letting it

4773.52 --> 4777.88
go but hey I'm not

4779.239 --> 4784.799999999999
God apparently he accepts whiny pieces

4782.8 --> 4788.0
of [Â __Â ] that spent their entire life

4784.8 --> 4788.0
trying to nag other

4791.52 --> 4795.639
people can you

4793.44 --> 4798.12
Dem the light on this

4795.639 --> 4800.96
here sure you

4798.12 --> 4803.36
can but uh you can't get an elevation

4800.96 --> 4803.36
angle

4805.12 --> 4809.5199999999995
though but yeah you can use a plum and a

4807.679 --> 4812.1990000000005
Zen it it's all super cute yeah blah

4809.52 --> 4815.2390000000005
blah blah yeah but you can't get that

4812.199 --> 4815.239
elevation angle

4818.8 --> 4824.84
yeah and that's the thing you need yeah

4821.96 --> 4828.159
it needs to be heed with the Horizon you

4824.84 --> 4831.08
can't just say oh vertical I'm just

4828.159 --> 4833.159
going to take an arbitrary contrast with

4831.08 --> 4835.5599999999995
vertical the

4833.159 --> 4836.96
horizontal and like oh yeah it sticks

4835.56 --> 4839.159000000001
out over the sphere you're going to

4836.96 --> 4841.4
point at like midair with that

4839.159 --> 4843.159
technically yeah now you can't use that

4841.4 --> 4846.239
you have to use the elevation angle you

4843.159 --> 4848.44
have to tether yourself to the Horizon

4846.239 --> 4851.04
right to get that angular

4848.44 --> 4853.04
consistency so you need the elevation

4851.04 --> 4855.12
angle you can't just use the all just

4853.04 --> 4857.32
take a horizontal versus the Zen and

4855.12 --> 4860.32
then oh we're just going to not look at

4857.32 --> 4863.36
the Horizon and just use it anyway and

4860.32 --> 4867.5199999999995
no no no you need the elevation angle

4863.36 --> 4872.719
you need the Horizon to orient

4867.52 --> 4872.719
yourself yeah need an elevation

4877.6 --> 4882.1990000000005
angle

4879.76 --> 4884.639
sorry is he a comedian no he's just a

4882.199 --> 4884.638999999999
dip [Â __Â ]

4884.679 --> 4889.4800000000005
why he dip [Â __Â ] it had to bring up

4886.56 --> 4891.360000000001
[Â __Â ] gay [Â __Â ] at the beginning of my

4889.48 --> 4894.839999999999
show

4891.36 --> 4896.88
so he's a a globber and he's a [Â __Â ]

4894.84 --> 4900.719
[Â __Â ] a glober that likes to hang

4896.88 --> 4904.679
around online [Â __Â ] gay

4900.719 --> 4907.679
bars very typical a lot of globers end

4904.679 --> 4907.679
up

4907.76 --> 4913.6
[Â __Â ] cuz space is

4911.639 --> 4917.2390000000005
gay

4913.6 --> 4920.400000000001
yeah and space force is full of

4917.239 --> 4922.799999999999
[Â __Â ] oh oh yes that's real yeah yeah

4920.4 --> 4925.08
oh you had you did not know yeah space

4922.8 --> 4927.76
is gay you're

4925.08 --> 4930.6
gay you believe in something that's

4927.76 --> 4930.6
inside out

4931.0 --> 4934.44
reality you're

4938.0 --> 4944.56
gay yeah that's

4941.56 --> 4944.56
official

4944.7 --> 4947.8189999999995
[Music]

4947.92 --> 4954.639
oh homophobic too

4951.199 --> 4958.08
oh yeah yeah I'm homophobic better damn

4954.639 --> 4961.76
believe it that's called being protected

4958.08 --> 4961.76
by God with common

4965.36 --> 4971.159
sense how do you pinpoint your position

4968.159 --> 4974.159
at C if you can't see the Horizon you

4971.159 --> 4976.159
don't you wait wait until you can wait

4974.159 --> 4979.36
until a clear

4976.159 --> 4981.679
moment or you heighten your position to

4979.36 --> 4984.839999999999
like on the mass so that you might look

4981.679 --> 4988.08
over whatever clouds might be in the way

4984.84 --> 4991.76
or whatever which can be like at at sea

4988.08 --> 4993.0
level clouds can hang very low sometimes

4991.76 --> 4995.159000000001
so you just got to find the right

4993.0 --> 4997.679
position but it like I mean on the ocean

4995.159 --> 5000.879999999999
it it's pretty it has to be like super

4997.679 --> 5002.88
Misty for you to not see a horizon it's

5000.88 --> 5006.159000000001
very rare that you can't see any Horizon

5002.88 --> 5006.159000000001
at all at the

5012.679 --> 5019.2390000000005
ocean yeah and establishes Zenith to the

5016.32 --> 5021.719
Stars it's pointless you you can't

5019.239 --> 5024.638999999999
really use like a plum Bob or a

5021.719 --> 5026.6
bubble on the ocean because it's not

5024.639 --> 5029.679
going to be

5026.6 --> 5031.76
stable now actually using the Horizon

5029.679 --> 5034.04
and using your own inner air to keep it

5031.76 --> 5036.360000000001
Balan that works way

5034.04 --> 5038.76
better much more effective or you have

5036.36 --> 5041.239
to have like this super elaborate

5038.76 --> 5043.4800000000005
mechanism that will keep like something

5041.239 --> 5045.36
super free floating but yeah that's all

5043.48 --> 5050.718999999999
modern technology that's

5045.36 --> 5053.12
like that's like late 19th century Mech

5050.719 --> 5055.199
mechanisms that didn't exist during

5053.12 --> 5057.96
exploration during exploration it was

5055.199 --> 5059.36
just a guy with an eye patch to prevent

5057.96 --> 5063.04
getting blinded from having the sun

5059.36 --> 5065.719
shown directly in their eye with the

5063.04 --> 5068.56
exent just keeping balance checking the

5065.719 --> 5071.32
Horizon cross referencing the Sun or the

5068.56 --> 5073.4400000000005
Polaris whatever that's what they did

5071.32 --> 5075.32
yeah there was no elaborate heavy

5073.44 --> 5077.599999999999
mechanism built in the ship that would

5075.32 --> 5080.88
keep the perfect Bal oh they didn't have

5077.6 --> 5083.88
all of that that's all late 19th century

5080.88 --> 5087.56
technology yeah back then it's just a

5083.88 --> 5089.88
seant ey patch to prevent

5087.56 --> 5092.52
blindness that's what you did and it

5089.88 --> 5094.32
worked perfectly why because the The

5092.52 --> 5096.92
Horizon is very

5094.32 --> 5100.28
consistent you can take that elevation

5096.92 --> 5103.2390000000005
angle measurement with it super

5100.28 --> 5104.719
handy yeah inner ear that's what you use

5103.239 --> 5107.04
to keep

5104.719 --> 5110.36
balance physical

5107.04 --> 5112.8
balance it's how a waiter keeps the

5110.36 --> 5115.679
drinks on the plate perfectly stable as

5112.8 --> 5118.52
they walk around quickly through a

5115.679 --> 5118.52
crowded

5121.28 --> 5124.28
restaurant

5136.52 --> 5142.119000000001
no go [Â __Â ] yourself dude I'm not here to

5140.4 --> 5144.08
provide you with videos you go search

5142.119 --> 5146.92
the videos you want to know about sex

5144.08 --> 5151.04
how they how they're used go watch 10th

5146.92 --> 5152.28
man's Channel go watch the old fed shows

5151.04 --> 5154.56
about it where all those Pres

5152.28 --> 5159.08
presentations were given where these

5154.56 --> 5161.96
seon manuals were shown on

5159.08 --> 5165.119
video explained right out yeah I'm not

5161.96 --> 5165.119
going to do that for

5172.679 --> 5177.719
you you said your sexon yeah that's

5181.199 --> 5184.199
cute

5187.159 --> 5193.759999999999
Eclipse elements

5190.32 --> 5193.759999999999
what what is

5195.32 --> 5200.599999999999
that is that a book or something would I

5198.679 --> 5204.639
read it I don't

5200.6 --> 5205.719
know it does kind of sound a bit boring

5204.639 --> 5211.159000000001
is that

5205.719 --> 5214.199
like Geometry book yeah goodie no I

5211.159 --> 5214.199
probably would not read it

5215.36 --> 5222.44
why would I I mean I know about ukan

5219.8 --> 5224.88
space and your cartisian space what I

5222.44 --> 5224.879999999999
need to

5230.28 --> 5235.32
know the SEC can be established on a

5232.92 --> 5237.4
sphere yeah it doesn't matter because

5235.32 --> 5239.28
you can have a xen it on a sphere but

5237.4 --> 5243.92
you can't have an elevation angle on a

5239.28 --> 5248.199
sphere yeah done

5243.92 --> 5251.52
a Zenit is not a

5248.199 --> 5254.719
replacement for an elevation

5251.52 --> 5254.719
angle all

5260.719 --> 5265.639
right can you have a zened angle on the

5263.52 --> 5267.56
sphere yeah sure but you can't have an

5265.639 --> 5270.2390000000005
elevation angle in a sphere and that's

5267.56 --> 5274.679
what you need for Celestial navigation

5270.239 --> 5278.08
not a Zenit angle you got it

5274.679 --> 5279.88
[Â __Â ] are you getting it yet you're

5278.08 --> 5282.92
going to keep reinserting that [Â __Â ]

5279.88 --> 5285.2390000000005
Zenit up your ass to try to get the

5282.92 --> 5287.6
globe through again because it's not

5285.239 --> 5290.119
going to work yeah you don't need a

5287.6 --> 5291.76
Zenit angle for Celestial navigation you

5290.119 --> 5293.48
need an elevation

5291.76 --> 5299.119000000001
angle

5293.48 --> 5299.119
yeah so let's move on now okay

5301.04 --> 5304.04
dumbass

5317.8 --> 5323.360000000001
no no you

5320.28 --> 5325.28
can't you can keep yelling and whining

5323.36 --> 5328.639
that over again and you can go Jack

5325.28 --> 5331.0
yourself off like a [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] it's

5328.639 --> 5334.0
wrong that's not how it

5331.0 --> 5334.0
works

5337.119 --> 5340.719
you can go [Â __Â ] yourself too

5343.119 --> 5348.04
bro I don't care I don't care how much

5345.92 --> 5350.119
you think you've won because you spent

5348.04 --> 5353.5199999999995
all your life trying to create this

5350.119 --> 5357.32
garbage to justify your [Â __Â ] Globe

5353.52 --> 5357.320000000001
belief okay you're

5359.119 --> 5363.92
wrong yeah that's not what it is

5365.32 --> 5367.639
this

5373.52 --> 5379.92
Sky there's just no point to this he's

5377.159 --> 5381.36
just not listening yeah my kidding of

5379.92 --> 5385.0
course he's not

5381.36 --> 5388.159
listening it's just just trying to force

5385.0 --> 5391.08
the globe like a [Â __Â ]

5388.159 --> 5395.48
[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] that have

5391.08 --> 5398.08
to come roll in try to talk about [Â __Â ]

5395.48 --> 5400.839999999999
stuff yeah cuz that's what draw that's

5398.08 --> 5403.159
what draws you in right [Â __Â ]

5400.84 --> 5405.08
[Â __Â ] oh you had some rumor about

5403.159 --> 5407.04
somebody being a [Â __Â ] oh that gets you

5405.08 --> 5410.04
in right you're always like oh oh I want

5407.04 --> 5412.44
to see gay things cuz you're a

5410.04 --> 5414.719
homo you're a homo and you like the

5412.44 --> 5417.44
globe you like to shove gloves up your

5414.719 --> 5420.639
ass don't you [Â __Â ]

5417.44 --> 5422.678999999999
[Â __Â ] yeah well guess what the Earth is

5420.639 --> 5427.52
not a globe you can't off that one up

5422.679 --> 5427.52
your ass [Â __Â ] yeah it's

5428.84 --> 5434.88
flat yeah you need an elevation angle

5431.88 --> 5434.88
not a zeni

5436.36 --> 5443.48
angle yeah you can do that on a sphere

5440.6 --> 5447.96
[Â __Â ] but you don't do

5443.48 --> 5452.32
that it's not the same thing a Zenit

5447.96 --> 5455.719
angle is not an elevation angle dumbass

5452.32 --> 5457.44
and it's not just 90Â° yeah on the globe

5455.719 --> 5462.76
it

5457.44 --> 5465.599999999999
isn't yeah that's supposed it zit 90Â°

5462.76 --> 5468.320000000001
yeah that's above the Horizon everywhere

5465.6 --> 5470.679
because you're on a [Â __Â ] Globe [Â __Â ]

5468.32 --> 5472.5199999999995
so you're never going to actually have

5470.679 --> 5475.4800000000005
the Horizon then

5472.52 --> 5477.320000000001
there you don't get that you're just

5475.48 --> 5480.759999999999
trying to cheat your way through like a

5477.32 --> 5483.759999999999
[Â __Â ] Bard

5480.76 --> 5483.76
[Â __Â ]

5488.92 --> 5495.36
yeah on a flat Earth [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] it's

5492.8 --> 5499.76
exactly

5495.36 --> 5503.239
90Â° on the Flat Earth on the globe it

5499.76 --> 5503.2390000000005
isn't cuz on the

5503.32 --> 5510.759999999999
globe yeah that that perfect horizontal

5506.4 --> 5512.679
it the globe is underneath the

5510.76 --> 5516.320000000001
horizon

5512.679 --> 5516.32
geometrically it doesn't

5517.159 --> 5523.679
work no no just no you can deny that

5522.0 --> 5526.52
dude I'm so [Â __Â ] sick of you could

5523.679 --> 5528.6
you just shut the [Â __Â ] up for a second

5526.52 --> 5534.56
I'm so [Â __Â ] sick of you

5528.6 --> 5534.56
man just shut the [Â __Â ] up just shut

5540.679 --> 5543.679
up

5548.28 --> 5555.08
no it's not something new you're

5551.08 --> 5556.96
hearing you know probably well familiar

5555.08 --> 5559.44
every family member you ever had

5556.96 --> 5561.44
probably told that to you you never do

5559.44 --> 5563.599999999999
do you you're one of those guys that

5561.44 --> 5566.36
never shuts the [Â __Â ]

5563.6 --> 5569.159000000001
up always just keeps pushing and pushing

5566.36 --> 5573.679
and lying until everybody just gives up

5569.159 --> 5575.239
and you can then feel like you won

5573.679 --> 5578.96
because you just kept

5575.239 --> 5582.48
pushing you don't care about reality you

5578.96 --> 5585.96
just want to be right in that moment no

5582.48 --> 5589.199
matter what reality is you'll force it

5585.96 --> 5591.28
you'll just force all kinds of

5589.199 --> 5593.96
things

5591.28 --> 5596.96
lies shameful

5593.96 --> 5596.96
Behavior

5597.36 --> 5604.08
shaming false

5600.32 --> 5607.5199999999995
accusations like rudimentary lies about

5604.08 --> 5610.48
the functioning of things it's really

5607.52 --> 5610.4800000000005
really damning

5620.239 --> 5624.919999999999
bro yeah I'm not just not going to

5622.28 --> 5627.119
listen to this guy I'm not going to

5624.92 --> 5630.4400000000005
delete him either I'm just going to let

5627.119 --> 5630.44
that [Â __Â ] sit

5630.56 --> 5636.84
there cuz he wants me to kick him out

5633.56 --> 5638.76
but I I want that crap that he rolled

5636.84 --> 5640.88
out I want it to stay there so people

5638.76 --> 5643.4800000000005
can see that yeah that's actually a

5640.88 --> 5649.88
[Â __Â ] scumback person actually forcing

5643.48 --> 5649.879999999999
that he actually doing it terrible

5650.88 --> 5657.32
terrible there's no way around

5654.639 --> 5660.08
it dude go make a [Â __Â ] video about it

5657.32 --> 5662.92
then [Â __Â ] nobody

5660.08 --> 5667.04
cares who giv a [Â __Â ] that you could get

5662.92 --> 5670.52
a zeni angle on a sphere nobody cares

5667.04 --> 5672.4
dude you don't use a Zenit angle for

5670.52 --> 5674.360000000001
Celestial navigation that's not how it

5672.4 --> 5677.839999999999
works [Â __Â ]

5674.36 --> 5680.96
[Â __Â ] you use the elevation angle and

5677.84 --> 5683.56
you don't care how that relates

5680.96 --> 5686.2390000000005
theoretically in your mind to the Zenith

5683.56 --> 5688.56
angle you don't use the Zenith angle you

5686.239 --> 5691.04
don't establish the Zenith angle you

5688.56 --> 5693.04
establish the elevation angle not the

5691.04 --> 5695.159
zeni angle I don't care how it

5693.04 --> 5697.76
theoretically fits right next to it in

5695.159 --> 5701.119
your idiotic

5697.76 --> 5705.2390000000005
mind it's not relevant

5701.119 --> 5708.4
[Â __Â ] Zenith angle is not relevant to

5705.239 --> 5711.839999999999
Celestial navigation you don't use it

5708.4 --> 5715.719
it's not mentioned in the manuals on how

5711.84 --> 5717.639
to do it you use the elevation angle

5715.719 --> 5720.4
stupid balard

5717.639 --> 5723.400000000001
fantasist are you going to drop it

5720.4 --> 5723.4
now

5735.53 --> 5738.88
[Music]

5745.239 --> 5751.959999999999
me oh my God yeah I'm not even going

5748.199 --> 5756.04
to emphasize that again I just I just

5751.96 --> 5759.28
want to move on so done with this

5756.04 --> 5763.679
[Â __Â ] I want to watch PDQ B again that

5759.28 --> 5763.679
was way more entertaining than this ass

5770.719 --> 5775.44
wipe let you move on I don't give a [Â __Â ]

5773.36 --> 5778.04
dude you're just go spamming I'm gonna

5775.44 --> 5782.32
ignore you

5778.04 --> 5785.28
now there's nothing more I can tell you

5782.32 --> 5785.28
you're not going to listen

5792.04 --> 5796.88
anyway yeah okay [Â __Â ] off

5800.199 --> 5807.32
bye it's all on camera anyway no more

5804.119 --> 5807.32
need for this

5810.28 --> 5813.28
[Â __Â ]

5814.76 --> 5819.360000000001
ah the room all that

5827.679 --> 5830.679
room

5831.32 --> 5835.639
right I wish there was a way though that

5833.719 --> 5838.199
you could just like time somebody out

5835.639 --> 5843.1990000000005
without deleting everything that they

5838.199 --> 5843.199
written it's a really bad system

5845.719 --> 5849.28
I mean if you like straight out ban

5847.679 --> 5852.4
everybody that makes

5849.28 --> 5854.36
sense like if you ban that they then

5852.4 --> 5857.36
everything disappear I get that but I

5854.36 --> 5860.839999999999
mean why isn't it just an option like

5857.36 --> 5863.239
delete history in the channel or

5860.84 --> 5865.52
something instead of like oh you do a

5863.239 --> 5868.0
timeout you do a ban everything's gone

5865.52 --> 5870.1990000000005
in the in that chat I don't get it why

5868.0 --> 5873.199
they do

5870.199 --> 5873.199
that

5878.04 --> 5882.44
like why don't they just have like in

5883.679 --> 5889.36
yeah I don't yeah the timeout should

5886.36 --> 5892.4
just be like just time it

5889.36 --> 5896.04
out don't remove

5892.4 --> 5896.04
everything just time it

5900.119 --> 5903.119
out

5903.84 --> 5908.28
but yeah that's how YouTube does it

5906.32 --> 5911.199
whatever what the hell am I going to

5908.28 --> 5913.44
title Today's show man that's all over

5911.199 --> 5913.44
the

5930.119 --> 5933.119
place

5947.84 --> 5950.639
just keep it like

5955.36 --> 5958.36
this

5960.04 --> 5963.04
yeah

5983.239 --> 5988.32
what esoteric what the [Â __Â ] is

5988.88 --> 5995.96
that get it so s esoterics apparently

5993.04 --> 5997.8
isn't a thing it would have to be called

5995.96 --> 6001.0
esoterica well I'm not going to say

5997.8 --> 6004.96
esoterica [Â __Â ] that so I'm just Rec

6001.0 --> 6007.639
coining the word from scratch it's

6004.96 --> 6011.8
esoterics I don't care if it doesn't

6007.639 --> 6011.8
work anymore for anybody else go [Â __Â ]

6014.719 --> 6019.719
yourself esotericas just sounds

6019.96 --> 6022.96
gay

6025.32 --> 6030.119
right the esoteric nature of something

6028.8 --> 6033.4800000000005
that's not

6030.119 --> 6036.88
esoteric it's [Â __Â ] gay it's

6033.48 --> 6039.36
esoterics that makes more sense to me so

6036.88 --> 6041.159000000001
whoever like originally devised that

6039.36 --> 6043.04
language that might have been like a gay

6041.159 --> 6046.32
impulse when they were doing

6043.04 --> 6049.92
that not surprising though if you know

6046.32 --> 6052.04
like what time period in England England

6049.92 --> 6054.56
all the words were div device there were

6052.04 --> 6057.32
quite a lot of like faggies in there as

6054.56 --> 6057.320000000001
well

6075.44 --> 6081.96
so angles are from Center yeah I know

6079.92 --> 6084.32
but they just think it's just this

6081.96 --> 6087.56
stupid notion you know it's like oh you

6084.32 --> 6089.04
take a vertical oh that fixes it no it

6087.56 --> 6091.76
doesn't fix at

6089.04 --> 6095.599
all oh then you take that and you take

6091.76 --> 6100.84
90Â° yeah but guess what that's not what

6095.599 --> 6105.96
you do though yeah cuz that 90 Dee par

6100.84 --> 6105.96
yeah perpendicular line to that

6107.199 --> 6114.5599999999995
vertical that sticks it's like over The

6111.96 --> 6117.199
Horizon it'll never be the Horizon

6114.56 --> 6117.1990000000005
because you're on a

6117.36 --> 6122.639
globe so it's always going to stick out

6120.239 --> 6127.598999999999
over the horizon the globe is going to

6122.639 --> 6130.56
be underneath that line and it

6127.599 --> 6132.639
isn't it doesn't work you can't do it

6130.56 --> 6134.8
that way it's not what you're supposed

6132.639 --> 6137.52
to be doing it's not in the instructions

6134.8 --> 6137.52
of celestial

6137.639 --> 6144.52
navigation don't take it vertical and

6140.199 --> 6146.96
then try to a 90Â° to that you go to the

6144.52 --> 6150.4800000000005
Horizon that's what you

6146.96 --> 6152.28
use why because the Horizon is so

6150.48 --> 6155.799999999999
incredibly

6152.28 --> 6157.92
stable yeah a plum line especially when

6155.8 --> 6160.360000000001
you're on a boat in the ocean is not

6157.92 --> 6163.679
freaking

6160.36 --> 6166.119
stable it's ridiculous on a rocking

6163.679 --> 6168.719
ocean The Horizon is the only thing that

6166.119 --> 6170.04
is that stable it's almost like magical

6168.719 --> 6172.4
everything is moving around you the

6170.04 --> 6175.119
ocean is around Ro is back and forth but

6172.4 --> 6176.92
the Horizon Way in the distance it's all

6175.119 --> 6179.759999999999
perfectly averaged

6176.92 --> 6182.2390000000005
out right as soon as it like the waves

6179.76 --> 6184.159000000001
are not in blocking it you might need to

6182.239 --> 6186.718999999999
go up in the mass or something like it's

6184.159 --> 6189.5199999999995
really flat like even when the ocean is

6186.719 --> 6191.76
all rocking it's

6189.52 --> 6193.4400000000005
Unique that's why they use the Horizon

6191.76 --> 6195.56
because it's so freaking stable even

6193.44 --> 6197.839999999999
when the ocean is

6195.56 --> 6202.679
Rocky that's the point that's why they

6197.84 --> 6202.679
use the Horizon and not a freaking

6206.239 --> 6209.239
vertical

6213.84 --> 6218.4800000000005
right is anybody still out there did

6216.199 --> 6220.919999999999
everybody flee because of this Ken

6218.48 --> 6224.159
[Â __Â ] spamming my chat next time I'll

6220.92 --> 6224.159
not let that happen next

6224.199 --> 6228.638999999999
time anybody still here beside Richard

6229.679 --> 6232.679
G

6239.92 --> 6245.32
quiet day I guess I don't know what's

6243.119 --> 6245.32
going

6247.28 --> 6251.44
on accept the trolls

6251.76 --> 6256.04
yeah yeah that's the problem you know

6254.199 --> 6258.719
when the trolls get a lot of room

6256.04 --> 6262.599
everybody else starts shutting up that's

6258.719 --> 6262.599
kind of a problem

6264.96 --> 6271.4
to help you argue the point

6267.84 --> 6274.32
better okay Brianna Johnson look I

6271.4 --> 6277.44
appreciate the gesture I think maybe but

6274.32 --> 6280.119
I really I don't like

6277.44 --> 6283.199
reading how dare you so stupid yeah [Â __Â ]

6280.119 --> 6286.32
that it's just I don't like

6283.199 --> 6289.0
it I mean I have rud Steiner's book here

6286.32 --> 6292.44
which is a really interesting book it's

6289.0 --> 6294.52
just that I always get so dist it's like

6292.44 --> 6296.36
I see patterns in it and then it's like

6294.52 --> 6299.4800000000005
okay I already know pretty much roughly

6296.36 --> 6304.0
what it's going to say and then when I

6299.48 --> 6309.28
check that I I I actually call

6304.0 --> 6311.8
it I just if it's like really dry stuff

6309.28 --> 6313.88
like this is like pure esoterics and

6311.8 --> 6317.599
spirit mechanics rudol Stein is just

6313.88 --> 6320.76
pure Spirit mechanics and even with that

6317.599 --> 6325.1990000000005
I get distracted and kind of bored it's

6320.76 --> 6327.04
like that's just I'm not a great reader

6325.199 --> 6328.719
and if it's going to be like about dry

6327.04 --> 6330.04
geometry there's literally no way I'm

6328.719 --> 6332.08
going to get through even three

6330.04 --> 6335.4
sentences without falling

6332.08 --> 6337.4
asleep that stuff is freaking boring man

6335.4 --> 6338.4
sometimes like I see Brian or something

6337.4 --> 6340.679
do

6338.4 --> 6343.598999999999
something that references that kind of

6340.679 --> 6347.2390000000005
thing and that bores me and that's a

6343.599 --> 6347.2390000000005
video when somebody's reading it

6348.88 --> 6353.56
out yeah yeah you're not welcome here

6351.56 --> 6358.360000000001
you [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] get the [Â __Â ] out of

6353.56 --> 6358.360000000001
here [Â __Â ] shove your glove up your

6372.8 --> 6376.92
ass right so yeah you can send it to me

6375.4 --> 6379.4
but I can almost guarantee you that I'm

6376.92 --> 6382.4
not going to read

6379.4 --> 6382.4
it

6385.0 --> 6390.04
unless it's like a really thin book that

6387.52 --> 6392.8
is really to the

6390.04 --> 6396.4
point and not written by somebody that

6392.8 --> 6400.92
really likes to read themselves say

6396.4 --> 6400.92
things a lot of math stuff

6403.92 --> 6409.4800000000005
is so yeah I'm just not about that I'm

6407.0 --> 6411.599
not going to be about that you're not

6409.48 --> 6413.239
going to turn me into a mathematician

6411.599 --> 6418.1990000000005
it's not what I am it's what I don't

6413.239 --> 6418.199
want to be and I don't need to

6419.119 --> 6427.839999999999
be I don't need to know math to get it

6425.119 --> 6431.88
right I just need to know what is real

6427.84 --> 6435.0
and what is not real and then know what

6431.88 --> 6437.08
how it works in math I don't need to do

6435.0 --> 6439.8
the math I just need to know the things

6437.08 --> 6442.4
in the math that you need to know what

6439.8 --> 6444.320000000001
is possible and what is impossible like

6442.4 --> 6445.92
you can't take an elevation angle of a

6444.32 --> 6450.799999999999
curved surface

6445.92 --> 6455.159
fact Universal fact unchanging

6450.8 --> 6457.92
fact you can't reord it to fix it it is

6455.159 --> 6460.48
what it is can't take an elevation angle

6457.92 --> 6460.4800000000005
of a curved

6461.04 --> 6468.199
surface and that includes a

6464.92 --> 6470.92
globe and that's just it you don't need

6468.199 --> 6474.04
to know the procedure

6470.92 --> 6477.56
you don't need to know the numbers you

6474.04 --> 6480.08
just need to know that

6477.56 --> 6482.159000000001
fact and you can demonstrate it to

6480.08 --> 6485.44
yourself yeah just go to a program type

6482.159 --> 6489.04
it in take an elevation yeah not you

6485.44 --> 6493.119
take a and you taking 90Â° oh I cheated

6489.04 --> 6496.44
it no you tell it elevation angle off

6493.119 --> 6498.799999999999
Globe [Â __Â ] not oh I'm going to take a

6496.44 --> 6502.119
vertical and the 90Â° no that's not an

6498.8 --> 6504.28
elevation angle dumbass

6502.119 --> 6507.48
that's not the same thing it's not the

6504.28 --> 6512.0
same procedure it's not the procedure

6507.48 --> 6514.119
that Celestial Navigators use they use

6512.0 --> 6516.96
the elevation angle they don't establish

6514.119 --> 6519.639
a vertical and then take a 90 to it

6516.96 --> 6521.159
[Â __Â ] you can fantasize that all day

6519.639 --> 6524.96
long it's not what they

6521.159 --> 6529.199
do you get an elevation

6524.96 --> 6532.199
angle and you can't do that off a curved

6529.199 --> 6532.199
surface

6533.48 --> 6539.04
no it's the same hor [Â __Â ] akumu I know

6536.599 --> 6541.719
it is the same hor [Â __Â ] you can't get an

6539.04 --> 6545.8
elevation angle of a curved surface I

6541.719 --> 6545.8
don't need to see your shitty

6545.96 --> 6552.76
videos like I don't need this this is

6549.36 --> 6555.759999999999
like to me guys what Ken zum Hof and

6552.76 --> 6558.320000000001
akum are doing here is like no I we do

6555.76 --> 6561.56
have proof that we went to the moon look

6558.32 --> 6563.759999999999
at this video look it's right there it's

6561.56 --> 6566.76
in the moon that's what they're doing

6563.76 --> 6569.52
it's like no it's not possible

6566.76 --> 6574.08
dumbass you can't do

6569.52 --> 6577.96
that it can't exist the math can't

6574.08 --> 6581.4
work I don't care what you made in cat

6577.96 --> 6585.08
you can't get an elevation angle the

6581.4 --> 6587.5599999999995
name elevation angle in the description

6585.08 --> 6590.28
you didn't use that I guarantee it I

6587.56 --> 6593.8
guarantee to anybody that would actually

6590.28 --> 6595.04
want to test akumu virus the dirty dirty

6593.8 --> 6597.96
dirty

6595.04 --> 6602.44
liar which you are right now I know it

6597.96 --> 6602.44
is I know you are a dirty liar right

6603.28 --> 6608.92
now

6605.8 --> 6611.400000000001
yeah I know that whatever video you made

6608.92 --> 6615.0
you didn't use an elevation

6611.4 --> 6619.119
angle cuz if you did it would given you

6615.0 --> 6622.32
an error I know that's how it works I

6619.119 --> 6625.719
don't even need to know how it works I

6622.32 --> 6628.88
just know that that is how it

6625.719 --> 6630.28
works yeah I don't need to do it myself

6628.88 --> 6634.599
I just need to

6630.28 --> 6637.84
know that thing is not that

6634.599 --> 6640.4400000000005
thing you're going to claim that thing

6637.84 --> 6642.1990000000005
to be that thing which it isn't that's

6640.44 --> 6644.36
what's happening I don't even need to

6642.199 --> 6646.638999999999
describe what those things are I just

6644.36 --> 6648.199
need to know here's the real one that

6646.639 --> 6650.04
you use there's the one that you're

6648.199 --> 6650.799999999999
going to try to claim is the same and

6650.04 --> 6654.32
and it

6650.8 --> 6654.320000000001
isn't that's what you

6655.32 --> 6659.599
do cat proves the dirt what are you

6658.119 --> 6663.44
talking about

6659.599 --> 6667.88
clear it's a lie you didn't use an

6663.44 --> 6671.638999999999
elevation angle cat no cat you didn't

6667.88 --> 6671.639
use an elevation angle I guarantee

6674.48 --> 6679.28
it yeah some angle sure I'm sure he used

6677.44 --> 6680.879999999999
some angle but it can't be an elevation

6679.28 --> 6682.28
angle because if you're going to insert

6680.88 --> 6684.76
elevation

6682.28 --> 6686.5199999999995
angle yeah it's going to give you an

6684.76 --> 6689.280000000001
error it doesn't work off a curved

6686.52 --> 6691.1990000000005
surface you can only do it off a flat

6689.28 --> 6693.759999999999
surface and then

6691.199 --> 6696.5199999999995
afterward claim that that flat surface

6693.76 --> 6696.52
was actually

6696.639 --> 6701.88
bent right so you take the angle of the

6699.76 --> 6703.320000000001
flat surface and then presuppose it was

6701.88 --> 6705.56
curved yeah that's the way you could do

6703.32 --> 6708.759999999999
it but that's not really an angle and

6705.56 --> 6714.280000000001
it's not reality either but I know that

6708.76 --> 6714.280000000001
you don't need need reality to prove a

6728.599 --> 6731.599
globe

6738.88 --> 6741.88
no

6755.76 --> 6761.360000000001
nonsense yeah I'm going to give you

6758.76 --> 6765.4400000000005
another timeout Akuma I'm sick of your

6761.36 --> 6768.0
lies I know you're lying I don't need to

6765.44 --> 6770.44
test what it is you think you're saying

6768.0 --> 6773.639
to know you're lying

6770.44 --> 6773.638999999999
I know you're

6798.76 --> 6801.76
lying

6821.719 --> 6828.4800000000005
no way he didn't actually do

6825.119 --> 6828.48
that that's

6828.76 --> 6831.76
ridiculous

6835.44 --> 6842.04
wow they actually do it they just this

6839.079 --> 6844.96
is just so [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] it's the

6842.04 --> 6849.28
same [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] akumo virus posted

6844.96 --> 6851.599
the same [Â __Â ] type of [Â __Â ] yeah you

6849.28 --> 6853.92
take a globe and then vertigo and then

6851.599 --> 6856.639
you take a line that's not the Horizon

6853.92 --> 6859.32
is sticking way way way out of the

6856.639 --> 6861.76
Horizon and then you just use that flat

6859.32 --> 6865.28
right you take a little flat Earth with

6861.76 --> 6866.96
an angle 90Â° 180Â° and then all

6865.28 --> 6869.679
underneath that's the glob yeah that's

6866.96 --> 6872.84
not what you [Â __Â ] do yeah in reality

6869.679 --> 6876.96
you use the Horizon dip

6872.84 --> 6880.1990000000005
[Â __Â ] yeah you don't take it

6876.96 --> 6883.84
vertical and then and then make it 90Â°

6880.199 --> 6885.598999999999
to that and you use that virtual 90Â° to

6883.84 --> 6888.679
the vertical no you don't use that you

6885.599 --> 6891.679
use the Horizon you [Â __Â ]

6888.679 --> 6891.679
[Â __Â ]

6892.679 --> 6898.56
I knew it it's the same crap it's

6895.88 --> 6900.2390000000005
exactly the same type of [Â __Â ] as a

6898.56 --> 6904.84
[Â __Â ] earlier

6900.239 --> 6904.839999999999
posted Ken zoom off it's the same

6908.119 --> 6913.239
crap yeah duper shut the [Â __Â ]

6918.32 --> 6926.4
up no nobody [Â __Â ] cares about that

6923.639 --> 6929.4800000000005
now we're talking

6926.4 --> 6933.598999999999
about elevation angles not being

6929.48 --> 6938.638999999999
possible to be measured off a globe I

6933.599 --> 6938.639
don't care about who betraying

6939.48 --> 6944.759999999999
what I got my own [Â __Â ] here to deal

6942.36 --> 6944.759999999999
with right

6948.599 --> 6951.599
now

6952.719 --> 6958.0
since it is yeah that's really nice

6955.0 --> 6960.719
completely Fantastical nonsense grg

6958.0 --> 6964.079
renzel I know I know that's what you

6960.719 --> 6971.119
believe works but nobody actually does

6964.079 --> 6976.84
that because in reality we use the

6971.119 --> 6976.839999999999
Horizon and not a perpendicular to a

6978.52 --> 6981.52
vertical

6993.84 --> 6998.360000000001
how do you perform Celestial navigation

6995.719 --> 7000.719
in hilly area Oh you mean not on the

6998.36 --> 7003.32
ocean yeah well on if you're not on the

7000.719 --> 7006.719
ocean if you're on land well then you

7003.32 --> 7009.5199999999995
can use like a bubble or a plum and

7006.719 --> 7012.28
actually do that that whole process that

7009.52 --> 7014.88
works on land that's

7012.28 --> 7017.5599999999995
great you can use the bubble sex and all

7014.88 --> 7019.4400000000005
that that's what they all use on land

7017.56 --> 7022.320000000001
because hey a lot of the times it's kind

7019.44 --> 7024.0
of difficult you have like you're in a

7022.32 --> 7027.119
valley or whatever yeah you don't see

7024.0 --> 7030.119
the Horizon in The Logical location

7027.119 --> 7033.159
because it's all way higher or whatever

7030.119 --> 7035.719
and then yeah you use all those things

7033.159 --> 7035.719
it's very

7036.119 --> 7042.159
cute but that's not what they used when

7038.56 --> 7042.159000000001
they were exploring oceans

7043.159 --> 7050.719
though yeah because you don't do

7046.92 --> 7053.88
that that's a procedure that's only

7050.719 --> 7056.52
really an option when you don't have the

7053.88 --> 7058.28
Horizon available to you which in most

7056.52 --> 7060.400000000001
cases even on land you will have the

7058.28 --> 7063.4
Horizon available

7060.4 --> 7063.4
you

7065.84 --> 7071.679
right so yeah on land on land is yeah

7069.639 --> 7074.0
you can use that bubble you do the

7071.679 --> 7076.56
vertical and then the parallel but on

7074.0 --> 7081.119
the ocean you don't do that

7076.56 --> 7084.92
again they did get around the ocean

7081.119 --> 7089.04
though for months and months and months

7084.92 --> 7092.639
floating on the ocean no land in sight

7089.04 --> 7096.56
still managing to find their way without

7092.639 --> 7098.76
a moment of Stillness of the water yeah

7096.56 --> 7101.119000000001
in months and months and months but they

7098.76 --> 7103.4400000000005
still found their way perfectly using

7101.119 --> 7106.079
Celestial

7103.44 --> 7108.0
navigation why because the Horizon is

7106.079 --> 7109.5199999999995
perfectly stable no matter how rocky the

7108.0 --> 7112.679
ocean

7109.52 --> 7115.84
is all we have to do is be able to keep

7112.679 --> 7118.079
balance on the ship in order to take

7115.84 --> 7119.92
that visual reading using your sex and

7118.079 --> 7121.96
then you use your inner ear balance

7119.92 --> 7125.92
system to do

7121.96 --> 7127.28
it cuz a plum or whatever or a bubble

7125.92 --> 7128.32
yeah and it doesn't really work on a

7127.28 --> 7130.88
rocky

7128.32 --> 7133.119
ocean and what if you broke it yeah then

7130.88 --> 7134.079
you're [Â __Â ] Sextant pretty simple

7133.119 --> 7137.04
device

7134.079 --> 7139.5599999999995
relatively you can just carry it with

7137.04 --> 7143.36
you in your pocket

7139.56 --> 7143.360000000001
maybe or in the small

7143.76 --> 7147.96
bag easily replaceable

7148.28 --> 7153.199
parts and you need the Horizon that's

7150.84 --> 7157.04
how they actually explored the

7153.199 --> 7160.28
ocean and not using a the light or

7157.04 --> 7163.5199999999995
bubble or whatever cuz that only used

7160.28 --> 7166.0
for land surveying as really like a more

7163.52 --> 7166.0
modern

7169.4 --> 7174.679
thing our Plum remains vertical on the

7171.96 --> 7174.679
roing

7176.0 --> 7179.4
no no it

7180.28 --> 7185.4
doesn't it's called momentum like that

7183.48 --> 7187.4
that's absolutely wrong what the hell

7185.4 --> 7191.239
are you talking about a plum remains

7187.4 --> 7191.239
vertical on a rocking B that's

7194.119 --> 7198.04
wrong no it's going to swing all over

7196.599 --> 7201.639
the place

7198.04 --> 7204.88
that what the [Â __Â ]

7201.639 --> 7209.079
man or have to be like one hell of a

7204.88 --> 7212.159000000001
heavy Plum like really heavy to be able

7209.079 --> 7214.32
to like stabil like the one in the taipe

7212.159 --> 7215.879999999999
building you have like this giant

7214.32 --> 7218.599
pendulum in there and that's

7215.88 --> 7220.28
specifically to like help it balance

7218.599 --> 7221.360000000001
against Earth Quakes right but that

7220.28 --> 7225.5199999999995
thing is

7221.36 --> 7228.799999999999
like a 100 ton

7225.52 --> 7232.639
thing yeah you're not going to carry a

7228.8 --> 7233.8
100 [Â __Â ] ton thing in your ship yeah

7232.639 --> 7235.84
that's

7233.8 --> 7238.56
ridiculous Yeah the more heavy the more

7235.84 --> 7240.8
stable and the more load you then have

7238.56 --> 7245.639
to haul

7240.8 --> 7248.079000000001
everywhere yeah not very handy I think

7245.639 --> 7250.36
they'd prefer to have a little bit more

7248.079 --> 7254.28
cargo that you could actually make money

7250.36 --> 7257.5199999999995
with and not a giant weight just so you

7254.28 --> 7259.5599999999995
could oh so just we can get that angle

7257.52 --> 7262.400000000001
for the celestial navigation because we

7259.56 --> 7266.88
can't use the Horizon because the Earth

7262.4 --> 7268.4
can't be flat so we can't use that ah no

7266.88 --> 7271.0
they're not going to carry that giant

7268.4 --> 7274.0
weight just because they were ball

7271.0 --> 7277.079
tarded they just use the Horizon which

7274.0 --> 7277.079
works because the Earth is

7278.04 --> 7281.04
flat

7289.32 --> 7297.48
a gyroscope instead of a plum on the sh

7292.44 --> 7297.48
what no what does that have to do with

7297.52 --> 7303.56
it I mean you can have an

7300.96 --> 7307.079
orientation I guess if you spawn a

7303.56 --> 7310.079000000001
modern gyroscope up then it will

7307.079 --> 7312.639
basically keep you steady it will show

7310.079 --> 7314.719
you your orientation in ukian space

7312.639 --> 7316.4800000000005
perfectly no matter how you move around

7314.719 --> 7319.639
I guess you could establish that

7316.48 --> 7319.638999999999
vertical out of

7319.719 --> 7322.719
that

7323.76 --> 7328.76
yeah your entire orientation even within

7327.32 --> 7331.5199999999995
ukian

7328.76 --> 7334.04
space so yeah gyroscope definitely you

7331.52 --> 7334.040000000001
can use

7337.96 --> 7340.96
that

7341.52 --> 7348.119000000001
yes gr Greg brunzel I

7345.639 --> 7351.28
know I was still responding to the

7348.119 --> 7351.28
[Â __Â ] earlier in

7352.0 --> 7357.4
chat including diver de Navy vet who

7354.92 --> 7360.719
still doubling down on his idiocy I

7357.4 --> 7360.719
can't believe that I

7365.48 --> 7372.28
just I mean it's shameful to even like

7369.239 --> 7373.799999999999
go around and call yourself like remind

7372.28 --> 7376.599
people that you're a Navy vet when

7373.8 --> 7381.1990000000005
you're rolling out barded

7376.599 --> 7381.1990000000005
misinformation idiocy like that's

7385.28 --> 7392.28
shameful barded is

7389.4 --> 7395.079
shameful and potentially dangerously

7392.28 --> 7395.079
misinformative

7397.88 --> 7400.88
yeah

7427.88 --> 7436.559
yeah

7430.679 --> 7436.559
Plum line easily get elevation angle

7443.28 --> 7448.8
no the only use that if there's no

7446.159 --> 7453.04
Horizon available cuz just establishing

7448.8 --> 7455.4400000000005
The Horizon is way easier and

7453.04 --> 7457.36
quicker it's like you iMed because

7455.44 --> 7460.879999999999
you're going to have to use visuals

7457.36 --> 7463.44
anyway right why would you want a plum

7460.88 --> 7466.159000000001
to establish the the horizontal

7463.44 --> 7468.159
basically and the elevation angle when

7466.159 --> 7471.199
you're then going to measure stars or

7468.159 --> 7473.839999999999
whatever within the skies why don't you

7471.199 --> 7477.638999999999
just immediately tether your situation

7473.84 --> 7481.400000000001
by oh look there's the

7477.639 --> 7484.079
Horizon angle to Horizon yeah oh what no

7481.4 --> 7486.28
I got to first like let this thing

7484.079 --> 7488.32
dangle there to like get that vertical

7486.28 --> 7491.079
and then like in my head oh parallel oh

7488.32 --> 7494.36
that's The Horizon there oh no we got to

7491.079 --> 7497.159
use the vertic what a bunch of nonsense

7494.36 --> 7498.92
take the device oh here's the Horizon ah

7497.159 --> 7502.119
here's the thing in relation to the

7498.92 --> 7504.4400000000005
Horizon done what do you mean dangle a

7502.119 --> 7508.639
stupid weight somewhere and then oh get

7504.44 --> 7512.678999999999
a virtual perpendicular it's a

7508.639 --> 7512.679
nonsense what a bunch of

7517.679 --> 7520.679
nonsense

7524.8 --> 7531.159000000001
on land there is no flat horizontal yes

7527.32 --> 7531.159
there is are you talking

7533.76 --> 7541.1990000000005
about absolutely there

7537.159 --> 7542.879999999999
is yeah on any land go high enough The

7541.199 --> 7546.598999999999
Horizon will be

7542.88 --> 7547.84
perfectly flat everywhere right oh yeah

7546.599 --> 7549.599
when you're close to the ground yeah

7547.84 --> 7552.4800000000005
there's stuff in the way way so there's

7549.599 --> 7554.8
stuff in the way of the Horizon perhaps

7552.48 --> 7557.44
but if you then want to be sure you just

7554.8 --> 7560.1990000000005
go to like one of the highest points you

7557.44 --> 7563.32
look around you it's

7560.199 --> 7566.079
flat yeah what you're going to see in

7563.32 --> 7570.4
the distance is going to be slightly

7566.079 --> 7573.88
below eye level but above your apparent

7570.4 --> 7576.638999999999
virtual height because the

7573.88 --> 7579.599
Horizon sits always slightly below ey

7576.639 --> 7582.0
level and then as you go higher up it

7579.599 --> 7585.8
moves with you and it keeps moving with

7582.0 --> 7588.0
you and it keeps moving with you

7585.8 --> 7590.4800000000005
forever

7588.0 --> 7594.28
forever it doesn't go

7590.48 --> 7594.28
down moves with

7607.28 --> 7610.599
you what

7613.28 --> 7620.4
big hole my left yes this my

7615.96 --> 7620.4
sweater can send the patch

7620.599 --> 7624.88
what what the [Â __Â ] lamby

7627.88 --> 7632.079
no I was kind of going to patch it

7630.4 --> 7634.638999999999
eventually but just haven't really

7632.079 --> 7634.639
gotten to

7636.76 --> 7642.8
it all right but no don't send it over

7640.559 --> 7642.8
that's

7643.559 --> 7649.1990000000005
ridiculous just send support and I'll

7646.28 --> 7649.199
have it patched

7655.04 --> 7659.92
here I

7657.52 --> 7662.0
might I mean with the co it is kind of

7659.92 --> 7663.76
nice to have it patched and weirdly

7662.0 --> 7666.079
enough like my other sweater which is

7663.76 --> 7668.599
identical to this one as a hole in

7666.079 --> 7670.558999999999
exactly the same spot and that's why

7668.599 --> 7673.28
some people think oh it's such a dirty

7670.559 --> 7676.04
sweater yeah no it's two sweaters two

7673.28 --> 7678.32
exactly identical sweaters with holes in

7676.04 --> 7680.96
the same place I'll show you I'll just

7678.32 --> 7680.96
freaking show

7681.159 --> 7684.48
you where is

7685.119 --> 7689.88
it

7686.76 --> 7694.079000000001
yeah right so

7689.88 --> 7696.04
see here's the other one other

7694.079 --> 7699.48
sweater where's the

7696.04 --> 7703.04
hole did have a hole in right

7699.48 --> 7705.199
oh doesn't have a hole oh okay my

7703.04 --> 7709.599
mistake the other one doesn't have a

7705.199 --> 7713.04
hole oh wait it does ha See

7709.599 --> 7713.04
whole same

7713.32 --> 7718.44
spot right that's kind of weird

7719.28 --> 7724.32
right but yeah not the same sweater

7721.92 --> 7724.32
here's the

7727.4 --> 7730.4
evidence

7735.199 --> 7740.638999999999
I appreciate that clamy I'm just I'm a

7738.04 --> 7743.159
little rled up from all the trolls I

7740.639 --> 7746.28
know you're just trying to be

7743.159 --> 7749.4
nice I just lean on my left armor yes

7746.28 --> 7751.4
that is definitely right I do like this

7749.4 --> 7754.48
is

7751.4 --> 7756.558999999999
my this I do this I never do it on this

7754.48 --> 7759.598999999999
side always on this that's probably the

7756.559 --> 7761.8
reason why that's a hole there

7759.599 --> 7763.4800000000005
because I lean on my left arm with my

7761.8 --> 7768.159000000001
chin

7763.48 --> 7768.159
sometimes if I do it too long I get ne

7770.679 --> 7775.8
problems but I mean I don't lean on this

7773.119 --> 7779.719
arm because this arm is like it has the

7775.8 --> 7781.679
free flow this is my mouse arm so I'm

7779.719 --> 7784.159
typically not leaning on it because I

7781.679 --> 7786.88
always need to have that elbow free

7784.159 --> 7790.199
because I'm doing things always with

7786.88 --> 7794.76
this left arm I don't use any specific

7790.199 --> 7798.32
Mo fine motorics so I then have a much

7794.76 --> 7800.84
more natural tendency to lean on

7798.32 --> 7802.04
it and that's why this side doesn't have

7800.84 --> 7806.2390000000005
a

7802.04 --> 7809.5199999999995
hole Mouse arm yep oh it's pretty it's

7806.239 --> 7812.4
elaborate too because like the muscles

7809.52 --> 7814.280000000001
how the muscles work here it's very

7812.4 --> 7817.839999999999
different from how the muscles work over

7814.28 --> 7820.0
there they're like I'm asymmetrical

7817.84 --> 7822.4800000000005
because of it like how the muscles are

7820.0 --> 7824.88
and how they function is asymmetrical

7822.48 --> 7827.5199999999995
like this side is like totally different

7824.88 --> 7829.4800000000005
what it can do how it is flexible how it

7827.52 --> 7832.119000000001
is strong is completely different from

7829.48 --> 7834.718999999999
this side and as I'm growing older it's

7832.119 --> 7837.5199999999995
only it it just stands more it stands

7834.719 --> 7837.52
out more to

7840.199 --> 7844.199
me I'm like Mark stck oh well thanks a

7843.04 --> 7847.44
lot for

7844.199 --> 7850.879999999999
that yeah you look like a pale alien

7847.44 --> 7850.879999999999
[Â __Â ] okay

7851.76 --> 7857.280000000001
thanks but yeah I am pretty much I like

7855.88 --> 7859.599
identical

7857.28 --> 7863.48
clothing and I like

7859.599 --> 7867.4400000000005
black and I like wearing the exact same

7863.48 --> 7869.718999999999
thing for decades I am I always actually

7867.44 --> 7871.638999999999
equated it to more Einstein style but

7869.719 --> 7873.76
then I realized that he can't even tie

7871.639 --> 7875.4800000000005
his own shoe laes so didn't really want

7873.76 --> 7879.320000000001
to compare it all that

7875.48 --> 7881.678999999999
much but I am like yeah I like exactly

7879.32 --> 7884.84
the same outfit I i' like to have two or

7881.679 --> 7887.639
three of like identical outfits and then

7884.84 --> 7892.1990000000005
that's what I do what's my favorite

7887.639 --> 7894.76
shirt well steamy travel shirts I got

7892.199 --> 7896.839999999999
two of them I've been wearing this one

7894.76 --> 7899.88
all this winter it's been doing great

7896.84 --> 7899.88
Flat Earth Early Bird

7904.92 --> 7910.84
shirt

7906.96 --> 7915.4800000000005
but I usually don't even have like

7910.84 --> 7915.4800000000005
pictures or text or anything on my

7917.159 --> 7921.119
shirts I've always liked my clothes kind

7919.76 --> 7924.599
of

7921.119 --> 7927.598999999999
blank canvases just singular colors no

7924.599 --> 7930.2390000000005
text no things on it only thing that

7927.599 --> 7933.1990000000005
should be standing out is jewelry which

7930.239 --> 7936.0
even that is really simplistic in

7933.199 --> 7938.678999999999
nature like that's how I like it I don't

7936.0 --> 7940.639
want text on me usually

7938.679 --> 7943.92
like my early bird t-shirts and all that

7940.639 --> 7948.2390000000005
is really like one of the first t-shirts

7943.92 --> 7948.2390000000005
with text on it that I've like worn in

7951.119 --> 7956.119
decades I mean I have a t-shirt with

7954.079 --> 7958.119
text on it I just don't wear it it's

7956.119 --> 7960.799999999999
because it's like yeah this is a funny

7958.119 --> 7962.558999999999
t-shirt I don't really want to wear it I

7960.8 --> 7963.320000000001
just want to show it and then like not

7962.559 --> 7966.4800000000005
wear

7963.32 --> 7968.28
it cuz it wouldn't feel good to like

7966.48 --> 7970.04
have that continually it's like like

7968.28 --> 7971.639
that joke is like funny for like 5

7970.04 --> 7973.48
seconds and then it's like yeah I don't

7971.639 --> 7976.4800000000005
really want to wear that

7973.48 --> 7976.48
anymore

7981.639 --> 7987.1990000000005
so anyway it's been a very Rowdy show

7984.76 --> 7987.1990000000005
today

7987.48 --> 7993.4
again Sun is going under oh let's see if

7991.04 --> 7996.559
you can see the moon now

7993.4 --> 8002.799999999999
again can you see the

7996.559 --> 8002.8
Moon can you see the moon I can see the

8003.4 --> 8006.4
moon

8014.159 --> 8018.4
wooo can you see the

8020.44 --> 8027.598999999999
Moon thermos shirts yeah I guess I don't

8024.8 --> 8028.4800000000005
really have thermal shirts though would

8027.599 --> 8031.28
be cool

8028.48 --> 8033.638999999999
I guess I got a bit of a thermal blanket

8031.28 --> 8037.88
too if I really need it I got a thermal

8033.639 --> 8041.52
blanket thing it's basically like this

8037.88 --> 8041.52
aluminum foil

8042.239 --> 8047.759999999999
thing so if it's like really like gets

8044.88 --> 8049.599
like minus 15 at night sometime it's

8047.76 --> 8053.360000000001
like okay I'm just probably going to put

8049.599 --> 8053.360000000001
that thing over my bed

8053.96 --> 8059.88
sheet just to prevent cooling off more

8072.44 --> 8078.598999999999
it's meid of the afternoon here yes uh

8076.079 --> 8078.599
it's now

8078.639 --> 8084.84
825 over

8081.119 --> 8086.88
here so I've been going for 2 hours 12

8084.84 --> 8089.28
minutes I started a bit late

8086.88 --> 8093.76
though

8089.28 --> 8097.079
I have no idea if fed is still going or

8093.76 --> 8099.320000000001
not they ended early yesterday as well

8097.079 --> 8102.759999999999
so I don't know what they're

8099.32 --> 8103.96
doing but I mean I'm in a cursing mood

8102.76 --> 8106.559
and it's

8103.96 --> 8109.639
like you're looking so stupid oh you're

8106.559 --> 8112.76
giving the troll so much go [Â __Â ]

8109.639 --> 8115.84
yourself I feel like

8112.76 --> 8119.92
this I'm going to just do

8115.84 --> 8123.84
it I don't really care that much like oh

8119.92 --> 8129.0
my God but then you can't pretend to

8123.84 --> 8132.360000000001
like be more emotionally inv vulnerable

8129.0 --> 8135.079
and but I am just this I need to be

8132.36 --> 8137.799999999999
honest I'm going to be honest if people

8135.079 --> 8140.5199999999995
are going to troll me with shameful [Â __Â ]

8137.8 --> 8144.400000000001
then I have to address

8140.52 --> 8146.88
it to prove that I'm not just trying to

8144.4 --> 8148.48
flee from those things but are actually

8146.88 --> 8150.32
very confronting and that I have been

8148.48 --> 8154.28
confronting it's just that those [Â __Â ]

8150.32 --> 8156.558999999999
troll ass wipes can't handle that I just

8154.28 --> 8158.4
talked about those things I I just was

8156.559 --> 8161.52
honest about it and then they're just

8158.4 --> 8164.04
like oh my God this could never be fixed

8161.52 --> 8166.679
because there are such [Â __Â ] chronic

8164.04 --> 8168.36
cowards they got all this horrifying

8166.679 --> 8170.679
[Â __Â ] in their own life they cannot even

8168.36 --> 8173.32
admit to themselves they were

8170.679 --> 8177.1990000000005
doing and so they just can't handle that

8173.32 --> 8178.88
a guy like me will just like honestly

8177.199 --> 8180.759999999999
analyze

8178.88 --> 8183.36
weird events that are potentially

8180.76 --> 8187.639
shameful in the past

8183.36 --> 8189.079
about just to have like genuine honest

8187.639 --> 8193.24
learning from

8189.079 --> 8196.0
it which is what I do like personal

8193.24 --> 8198.96
development learning honesty

8196.0 --> 8201.639
confrontation is like the Cornerstone of

8198.96 --> 8201.639
what I do

8202.08 --> 8209.96
here it's what I do here if I avoid that

8206.479 --> 8212.479
I'd just be a worthless [Â __Â ] like all

8209.96 --> 8214.279999999999
the rest of them out there just be

8212.479 --> 8217.88
another

8214.28 --> 8222.08
generic attention grabby hyperactive

8217.88 --> 8225.559
weirdo nobody cared but I share this

8222.08 --> 8229.559
really very sensitive very close to the

8225.559 --> 8235.039999999999
Heart To Danger Zone like potential

8229.559 --> 8238.199999999999
fatal shame whatever yeah I I share that

8235.04 --> 8240.960000000001
I tell it to you I analyze it honestly

8238.2 --> 8244.679
I'm telling you where it came from and

8240.96 --> 8246.438999999998
you can't handle that but I can I can

8244.679 --> 8249.84
handle that and that is what really

8246.439 --> 8253.12
matters because it's my life my choice I

8249.84 --> 8255.479
don't care what you think

8253.12 --> 8258.479000000001
oh no just

8255.479 --> 8258.479
kidding

8258.92 --> 8266.479
just that was a uh a pit video

8264.16 --> 8269.359
reference I didn't actually mean to

8266.479 --> 8271.639
transition into that

8269.359 --> 8275.719000000001
but it it it did start to like kind of

8271.639 --> 8278.24
resemble that a bit sorry I I am weird

8275.719 --> 8282.518999999998
sometimes I just undermine myself with

8278.24 --> 8285.319
jokes it's just weird but uh yeah it's

8282.519 --> 8287.599
what I do super honesty and then

8285.319 --> 8291.16
eventually like it's like

8287.599 --> 8294.559
yeah it's good I was honest about it

8291.16 --> 8297.679
people have weird things in their lives

8294.559 --> 8300.639
and it's all about like are you going to

8297.679 --> 8303.439
deny that's real how much are you going

8300.639 --> 8306.8
to twist your life around just to be

8303.439 --> 8309.2
able to perpetuate your denial of what's

8306.8 --> 8310.88
real how much are you going to [Â __Â ]

8309.2 --> 8313.800000000001
around how much are you going to let

8310.88 --> 8316.719
yourself look like a complete deranged

8313.8 --> 8318.438999999998
lunatic not because you use swear words

8316.719 --> 8320.559
but because you continually avoid

8318.439 --> 8322.84
question you continually try to peer

8320.559 --> 8324.759999999998
pressure as soon as somebody points out

8322.84 --> 8327.0
that you're technically wrong with

8324.76 --> 8330.319
something you're just going to avoid all

8327.0 --> 8333.8
that [Â __Â ] the real derangements there is

8330.319 --> 8333.8
in your

8334.04 --> 8341.399000000001
perpetuating of of what you should know

8338.2 --> 8344.28
is true you just avoid it and you keep

8341.399 --> 8344.279999999999
perpetuating

8347.639 --> 8354.319
that oh God yeah duper

8351.16 --> 8357.8
H thanks for

8354.319 --> 8359.359
that but I mean yeah I mean I there's

8357.8 --> 8362.479
nothing is ever going to happen like

8359.359 --> 8365.679
ever it really won't I mean the best I

8362.479 --> 8367.88
could do for you is just whip you bloody

8365.679 --> 8369.519
I'll whip you bloody I'm not going to

8367.88 --> 8371.839999999998
[Â __Â ] you bloody but I'll whip you bloody

8369.519 --> 8374.2
I'll take a freaking horse I at least

8371.84 --> 8376.359
steal Whip and just keep slaping until

8374.2 --> 8378.679
you like pass out from blood loss yeah

8376.359 --> 8381.76
I'll do that for you if if that's really

8378.679 --> 8384.319
what you want you can't help yourself

8381.76 --> 8386.84
but that's that's as far as it goes dude

8384.319 --> 8388.039999999999
I'll whip you bloody and that's as far

8386.84 --> 8389.439
as it goes

8388.04 --> 8391.68
there's nothing else you're going to get

8389.439 --> 8391.68
from

8401.04 --> 8407.319000000001
me that's what you respect the most a

8404.08 --> 8410.52
thanks I do my best it's like but I have

8407.319 --> 8415.279999999999
to do it too Richard it's like it's the

8410.52 --> 8419.359
only way I'm like karmically allowed to

8415.28 --> 8419.359
retain my sensitivity

8423.28 --> 8430.0
because the sensitivity and like being

8426.84 --> 8434.439
more manly and stoic it's really

8430.0 --> 8438.04
difficult this is like counter one is in

8434.439 --> 8440.800000000001
direct burden on the other and the other

8438.04 --> 8442.640000000001
is like making the other imp it's like

8440.8 --> 8446.399
but I can still do

8442.64 --> 8451.0
it by just being brutally honest about

8446.399 --> 8454.519999999999
the feelings and like not letting that I

8451.0 --> 8458.28
have feelings get to my feeling so I'm

8454.52 --> 8459.439
stoic with honesty about the feelings

8458.28 --> 8462.76
that I

8459.439 --> 8465.399
have and that's the only way it can fit

8462.76 --> 8468.68
together it's the only way I can retain

8465.399 --> 8472.8
both it's the only way I can retain some

8468.68 --> 8474.68
inkling of stoic dignity and still have

8472.8 --> 8478.479
like lots of

8474.68 --> 8483.04
feelings it's the only way brutal

8478.479 --> 8485.679999999998
honesty and just like stoic analytics of

8483.04 --> 8487.479000000001
feelings but still having the feelings

8485.68 --> 8490.2
but when you analyze it you have to be

8487.479 --> 8491.119999999999
stoic and that's the only way it works

8490.2 --> 8493.720000000001
for

8491.12 --> 8496.92
me and I hope that other people are

8493.72 --> 8500.96
noticing that and maybe like copying

8496.92 --> 8500.960000000001
that as they test these things for

8501.28 --> 8506.24
themselves am I familiar with kofy I

8504.72 --> 8510.039999999999
don't

8506.24 --> 8510.039999999999
know can get more

8510.6 --> 8516.16
donations all take large it's not that

8513.24 --> 8519.439
large Glam me I mean PayPal is that's

8516.16 --> 8524.2
not a big cut patreon doesn't take a

8519.439 --> 8524.2
cut if you said it not to do

8525.24 --> 8529.92
that but I've not heard of Kofi wait is

8529.12 --> 8533.52
that

8529.92 --> 8536.88
like a the the coffee thing that people

8533.52 --> 8540.16
just call it coffee right get buy me a

8536.88 --> 8543.92
coffee is that cof yeah that thing is

8540.16 --> 8546.039999999999
all United States it doesn't work here

8543.92 --> 8549.2
it's like a a catch all thing you can

8546.04 --> 8552.28
like tie every type of Finance platform

8549.2 --> 8553.880000000001
into it but it technically only works

8552.28 --> 8555.800000000001
for the United States it wouldn't work

8553.88 --> 8560.56
for

8555.8 --> 8560.56
me Nathan is asking people Cofe

8561.68 --> 8564.68
donations

8566.16 --> 8575.2
okay thinking of Sophie

8570.24 --> 8575.199999999999
oh oh okay it's a different

8579.28 --> 8585.16
one okay that's something new then I

8581.64 --> 8587.68
guess I don't know hey but sure like if

8585.16 --> 8590.2
that if that works I'll take it but I

8587.68 --> 8591.960000000001
mean there shouldn't be too much issue

8590.2 --> 8594.240000000002
like if you want to donate donate to the

8591.96 --> 8596.839999999998
ppal I get it very quickly that's like

8594.24 --> 8598.52
the most precious about it I get it so

8596.84 --> 8600.399
quick

8598.52 --> 8603.08
like when I really need it like help I

8600.399 --> 8605.76
need donations now because tomorrow I'm

8603.08 --> 8608.64
going to be out of food and then when

8605.76 --> 8610.0
people donate I actually get it in time

8608.64 --> 8612.76
that's the big difference with like

8610.0 --> 8615.68
every other

8612.76 --> 8618.0
thing right and that's why I've been

8615.68 --> 8620.84
really enjoying PayPal I'm very thankful

8618.0 --> 8622.72
that despite all of my attitude and

8620.84 --> 8627.16
everything in my

8622.72 --> 8629.319
opinions yeah especially about gays and

8627.16 --> 8632.119999999999
me like having a bit of a laugh about

8629.319 --> 8635.24
Jews sometimes that they haven't like

8632.12 --> 8635.240000000002
kicked me off for all

8635.68 --> 8640.52
that I really I'm really thankful for

8641.16 --> 8650.039999999999
that right so PayPal's worked great for

8645.439 --> 8653.880000000001
me so far they haven't like blocked me

8650.04 --> 8655.68
once for years despite

8653.88 --> 8658.358999999999
everything

8655.68 --> 8661.0
so as far far as I'm concerned PayPal

8658.359 --> 8663.16
should work just fine but yeah if that

8661.0 --> 8666.2
new thing with you're saying cof

8663.16 --> 8668.56
whatever if that's cool I'd love to like

8666.2 --> 8668.560000000001
check it

8668.72 --> 8673.679999999998
out but in my experience there's like

8671.399 --> 8675.278999999999
there's a lot of different like online

8673.68 --> 8679.64
paying

8675.279 --> 8682.08
platforms but it's like 80% of all of

8679.64 --> 8684.84
those like only work in the United

8682.08 --> 8687.52
States there's a lot of special things

8684.84 --> 8689.880000000001
how to have money go back and forth over

8687.52 --> 8691.800000000001
the internet in the United States but

8689.88 --> 8693.72
there's not that many that actually go

8691.8 --> 8695.56
outside of the United States and PayPal

8693.72 --> 8698.8
is like one of the few of those that do

8695.56 --> 8698.8
that and

8699.16 --> 8705.84
patreon and gift and

8701.96 --> 8705.839999999998
go and there might be others

8705.96 --> 8710.679999999998
too but in the past I've bumped into

8708.72 --> 8712.479
many like oh I'm just using this and

8710.68 --> 8714.12
that and then like oh I try it out and

8712.479 --> 8715.88
it doesn't work it only works in the

8714.12 --> 8718.880000000001
United

8715.88 --> 8718.88
States

8719.08 --> 8723.84
but I mean a lot of different online

8721.319 --> 8725.24
paying thing platform systems have

8723.84 --> 8727.8
popped up

8725.24 --> 8730.6
so there could be like one popping up

8727.8 --> 8733.438999999998
every month I I'm not really like on the

8730.6 --> 8735.52
edge finding out but I mean there's a

8733.439 --> 8738.08
lot of development in

8735.52 --> 8739.6
that which is not strange at all since

8738.08 --> 8741.92
like the world is financially

8739.6 --> 8744.479000000001
destabilizing so the need for that kind

8741.92 --> 8748.6
of fluid Payment Systems is going to be

8744.479 --> 8750.599999999999
higher and higher cu the the the usual

8748.6 --> 8752.359
pillars that we've all rested on for so

8750.6 --> 8756.399000000001
long are all getting worse and

8752.359 --> 8759.68
destabilizing so more more fluid Payment

8756.399 --> 8763.278999999999
Systems will be in

8759.68 --> 8763.279
demand it's only

8763.84 --> 8766.84
logical

8774.0 --> 8778.08
right

8775.8 --> 8779.72
anyway

8778.08 --> 8782.96
I hope you've been enjoying the show I'm

8779.72 --> 8785.679999999998
I'm probably going to round out

8782.96 --> 8787.358999999999
now and yeah I

8785.68 --> 8790.56
mean I

8787.359 --> 8792.16
swear I swear sometimes I do it a lot

8790.56 --> 8796.0
and especially if you're going to tell

8792.16 --> 8798.24
me in the chat to not do that or oh then

8796.0 --> 8801.68
I'm like I'm going to just like triple

8798.24 --> 8804.56
pile it on then like people complaining

8801.68 --> 8807.76
about swearing makes me swear three

8804.56 --> 8810.56
times as rough it's just what I do

8807.76 --> 8813.960000000001
do because when I feel like swearing you

8810.56 --> 8816.56
you shouldn't stop me it just gets

8813.96 --> 8819.96
worse and then when I'm

8816.56 --> 8825.119999999999
done when I'm out of swearing

8819.96 --> 8828.72
moods then it's not like I like

8825.12 --> 8831.439
swearing just sometimes I need to do

8828.72 --> 8833.278999999999
that and then eventually it'll stop

8831.439 --> 8837.800000000001
right and if nobody complains about me

8833.279 --> 8842.640000000001
swear and guess what happens it ends

8837.8 --> 8845.039999999999
quicker I get back to just normal verbal

8842.64 --> 8847.519999999999
communication

8845.04 --> 8850.399000000001
quicker but you guys all know that it's

8847.52 --> 8853.12
just the trolls they just use it they

8850.399 --> 8856.08
know that by doing that they're

8853.12 --> 8859.52
provoking it they know it and I know it

8856.08 --> 8861.319
it's just I can't be ar it's like oh you

8859.52 --> 8863.720000000001
want that okay well [Â __Â ] you then I'll

8861.319 --> 8863.72
just do

8864.24 --> 8872.56
that yeah and hey it's a a 12 plus

8868.88 --> 8874.479
show so yeah I mean if you're 8 years

8872.56 --> 8877.64
old and you're like wow what is all this

8874.479 --> 8880.16
adult stuff well guess what happens very

8877.64 --> 8884.08
rough things happen sometimes verbally

8880.16 --> 8886.039999999999
very gross things sometimes very

8884.08 --> 8888.96
violent sometimes like super

8886.04 --> 8891.279
inappropriate that happens it that's why

8888.96 --> 8894.519999999999
it's 12 plus and not all

8891.279 --> 8897.800000000001
ages yeah and at 12 you should be

8894.52 --> 8900.6
expected to be able to here swearing or

8897.8 --> 8903.519999999999
somebody going really angry on somebody

8900.6 --> 8906.16
else without losing your mind and having

8903.52 --> 8908.479000000001
to be committed yeah if you have that at

8906.16 --> 8911.399
12 you have a [Â __Â ] problem and you

8908.479 --> 8914.08
should just stay away from all media

8911.399 --> 8919.119999999999
then all of it

8914.08 --> 8921.72
guaranteed okay so yeah it's not if

8919.12 --> 8927.160000000002
you're all the goody two shoes who can't

8921.72 --> 8931.438999999998
handle the word [Â __Â ] or [Â __Â ] or [Â __Â ] this

8927.16 --> 8933.08
is not the place for you those words are

8931.439 --> 8936.6
going to be

8933.08 --> 8938.039999999999
used and they're not used to insult you

8936.6 --> 8941.52
the

8938.04 --> 8946.359
listener but you will have to endure

8941.52 --> 8949.24
that if you want to partake in this show

8946.359 --> 8951.68
and keep following it's going to happen

8949.24 --> 8956.0
and you need to deal with that and you

8951.68 --> 8958.52
can't manipulate me into not doing that

8956.0 --> 8958.52
anymore

8959.08 --> 8963.08
okay just so that it's

8964.439 --> 8970.479000000001
clear right so overall very interesting

8968.359 --> 8974.24
show today the the first part I'm going

8970.479 --> 8976.479
to watch back because I was really into

8974.24 --> 8978.88
the the esoterics of that inner Dynamo

8976.479 --> 8981.358999999999
I'm fascinated because it is important

8978.88 --> 8984.479
the inner Dynamo it's already going

8981.359 --> 8986.16
decently fast but it's like at onethird

8984.479 --> 8987.88
of the cycle so I'm like at the

8986.16 --> 8991.52
beginning beginning of the spin cycle

8987.88 --> 8995.278999999999
which is already fast because I'm always

8991.52 --> 8997.0
fast it's just I'm fast or I'm so fast

8995.279 --> 8999.880000000001
that I crash and then it's off for a

8997.0 --> 9002.16
while but as soon as it gets back

8999.88 --> 9005.399
together and it goes back up it's going

9002.16 --> 9007.279
to go pretty damn fast it starts fast it

9005.399 --> 9008.76
just goes faster and faster and faster

9007.279 --> 9011.12
until it's so fast it goes out of

9008.76 --> 9013.64
control and then it falls down and then

9011.12 --> 9016.68
it crashes as soon as it gets back up

9013.64 --> 9018.119999999999
it's fast again I'm fast this is what I

9016.68 --> 9019.24
am this is how I've always been my

9018.12 --> 9022.92
spirit is

9019.24 --> 9025.64
like three times as quick as everybody

9022.92 --> 9028.56
else is I'm a fast spirit always have

9025.64 --> 9031.319
been from birth fast to catch on things

9028.56 --> 9034.8
if I care if I'm

9031.319 --> 9037.08
interested fast to understand things and

9034.8 --> 9040.679999999998
people and motivations and their actions

9037.08 --> 9043.64
if I can resonate with their frequency

9040.68 --> 9045.84
very fast I'm naturally fast it's like

9043.64 --> 9049.08
my processor is like at triple the

9045.84 --> 9053.6
normal speed speed of regular people it

9049.08 --> 9056.08
always has been but it has this system

9053.6 --> 9057.640000000001
where the inner Damo is directly

9056.08 --> 9060.72
connected it's like something an

9057.64 --> 9063.519999999999
exciting thing that's always being kept

9060.72 --> 9067.08
busy and being pushed forward by my

9063.52 --> 9070.6
thoughts to keep it up to keep my mind

9067.08 --> 9073.96
busy and not get depressed from

9070.6 --> 9075.720000000001
boredom but then eventually it just like

9073.96 --> 9077.839999999998
gives it too much force and then it

9075.72 --> 9080.039999999999
collapses and and every thought is a

9077.84 --> 9083.56
nightmare it's like ah how do I not

9080.04 --> 9085.720000000001
think how do I not think ah ah the dream

9083.56 --> 9088.24
oh I'm think I'm in the forest it's it's

9085.72 --> 9090.84
spring it's nice sun it's it's Misty

9088.24 --> 9094.359
it's warm and oh it's nothing no

9090.84 --> 9095.960000000001
thoughts and then eventually like oh oh

9094.359 --> 9098.52
my God it's

9095.96 --> 9101.119999999999
done so that's the short short short

9098.52 --> 9102.68
version summary of all that it's at the

9101.12 --> 9106.960000000001
beginning of the show I'm quite proud of

9102.68 --> 9109.880000000001
it before the freaking whining about oh

9106.96 --> 9114.0
do you kiss the guy you kiss the guy ar

9109.88 --> 9116.519999999999
oh you're so gay started

9114.0 --> 9119.04
yeah sorry about the vomic Chon that's

9116.52 --> 9121.6
fine steamie that's just

9119.04 --> 9124.080000000002
timing but I mean I did thought that the

9121.6 --> 9126.279
first segment of the show was very

9124.08 --> 9128.68
interesting like worthwhile listening

9126.279 --> 9131.68
like you if you have anything like that

9128.68 --> 9134.84
or you know a family member that has

9131.68 --> 9137.800000000001
that this is valuable information for

9134.84 --> 9140.479
you that's time it's like you only have

9137.8 --> 9144.278999999999
to learn to understand it once and when

9140.479 --> 9146.599999999999
you do that you can just change your

9144.279 --> 9148.479000000001
scope on that entire experience every

9146.6 --> 9151.359
time instead of just think oh no the

9148.479 --> 9152.96
nightmares oh everything is a nightmare

9151.359 --> 9155.08
I want to die instead of thinking like

9152.96 --> 9156.88
that it's like no there's there's it's

9155.08 --> 9159.2
happening for a reason there's something

9156.88 --> 9161.88
happening there you need to go through

9159.2 --> 9164.08
that it's like every now and then you

9161.88 --> 9166.92
need to clean out your

9164.08 --> 9170.0
machine right cuz if you don't

9166.92 --> 9172.960000000001
don't it goes and it breaks you need to

9170.0 --> 9174.68
clean it out every now and then so to do

9172.96 --> 9176.8
that yeah that's the same with your

9174.68 --> 9178.399
spirit if you're very active if you're

9176.8 --> 9180.64
like an engine if you're like always

9178.399 --> 9183.319
doing something with your mind you need

9180.64 --> 9185.519999999999
to clean it out every once in a while or

9183.319 --> 9187.199999999999
it's going to actually break and like

9185.52 --> 9191.399000000001
yield actual

9187.2 --> 9196.399000000001
psychotic things you need to clean it

9191.399 --> 9198.599999999999
out and so having this thing does that

9196.399 --> 9203.76
it

9198.6 --> 9205.68
forces the the D inner Dynamo to stop

9203.76 --> 9207.960000000001
crash and

9205.68 --> 9212.279
restart and it's like while it's

9207.96 --> 9213.72
stopping it'll make me stop reinforcing

9212.279 --> 9215.800000000001
keeping it spinning up because every

9213.72 --> 9218.76
time I do with any thought it'll make me

9215.8 --> 9221.319
throw up more so it's like oh suddenly

9218.76 --> 9225.16
the thing that always makes it work it's

9221.319 --> 9228.039999999999
forced to stop by Crashing

9225.16 --> 9230.6
Down because normally I make it keep

9228.04 --> 9232.68
going with my thoughts but if I do it

9230.6 --> 9235.76
once it crashed then it'll literally

9232.68 --> 9240.84
make me sick so there is like an

9235.76 --> 9244.359
actual tangible dare I say spiritual

9240.84 --> 9245.52
mechanics behind it it's really what I

9244.359 --> 9249.479000000001
describe

9245.52 --> 9251.880000000001
like it's not a vague General refence no

9249.479 --> 9254.438999999998
it's like the real experience the real

9251.88 --> 9256.759999999998
things that I feel happening

9254.439 --> 9260.56
there and there should be other people

9256.76 --> 9260.56
that have similar experiences with

9268.68 --> 9271.68
that

9272.64 --> 9279.68
H

9274.52 --> 9283.2
AMD Fred Ripper processor super fast

9279.68 --> 9284.68
yeah something like that oh by the way

9283.2 --> 9289.2
uh was it steamy

9284.68 --> 9291.92
traveler did you give me like that

9289.2 --> 9293.240000000002
link the video of the processor yeah

9291.92 --> 9294.76
that was you wasn't it yeah it was an

9293.24 --> 9298.6
interesting

9294.76 --> 9302.439
video it was like super nerdy

9298.6 --> 9304.04
though it's like dry mechanical

9302.439 --> 9306.04
explanation with some good visual

9304.04 --> 9306.960000000001
support it's like it was like really

9306.04 --> 9309.080000000002
like

9306.96 --> 9312.358999999999
programming interesting I watched the

9309.08 --> 9313.64
whole thing and I remembered like half

9312.359 --> 9317.0
of

9313.64 --> 9321.519999999999
it because I've seen this St I in the

9317.0 --> 9323.319
'90s I was fascinated with this not not

9321.52 --> 9324.880000000001
all that much has really even changed in

9323.319 --> 9327.479
like how Graphics are designed and

9324.88 --> 9329.599999999999
polygons like all the words they use in

9327.479 --> 9333.92
that I all recognize them from the time

9329.6 --> 9335.12
when I was working with imagine 3D on my

9333.92 --> 9337.68
igga

9335.12 --> 9341.0
1200 doing these things doing rate

9337.68 --> 9345.16
tracing making an image that would take

9341.0 --> 9347.12
like 4 hours to render it's amazing how

9345.16 --> 9349.2
much I recognize of what they explained

9347.12 --> 9352.92
in there and they do it so well it's a

9349.2 --> 9356.960000000001
great great video for the technical

9352.92 --> 9356.960000000001
explanation of how that happens very

9357.0 --> 9363.56
interesting so yeah very technical video

9360.84 --> 9365.08
from steamy traveler I appreciated that

9363.56 --> 9367.439
and I'm sharing it right here so you can

9365.08 --> 9371.319
take a look at that as I'm rounding out

9367.439 --> 9374.2
the show because yeah eventually every

9371.319 --> 9376.64
show has to

9374.2 --> 9379.6
end and it's getting kind of dark here

9376.64 --> 9382.76
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

9379.6 --> 9385.84
like this show it was plenty Rowdy I

9382.76 --> 9387.800000000001
know but I thought that was still very

9385.84 --> 9389.64
interesting and despite the rowdiness I

9387.8 --> 9393.399
think I was pretty good on

9389.64 --> 9395.72
form despite all the nagging like oh but

9393.399 --> 9397.599999999999
you can take it vertical you don't need

9395.72 --> 9399.84
an elevation angle you can take it

9397.6 --> 9401.640000000001
vertical and then then you're sticking

9399.84 --> 9404.880000000001
out over the horizon so you're going to

9401.64 --> 9408.439
do those things that you don't actually

9404.88 --> 9412.24
do you just use a horizon in

9408.439 --> 9414.24
reality right they'll keep forcing it

9412.24 --> 9415.92
and that's why there's also a lot of

9414.24 --> 9420.479
cussing in this

9415.92 --> 9422.76
video right so anyway if you liked it

9420.479 --> 9424.88
don't forget to Rogan it up and if you

9422.76 --> 9426.880000000001
haven't already subscribe to my channel

9424.88 --> 9430.24
hit the Bell notification so you know

9426.88 --> 9433.399
when I'm going live is normally 2 p.m mm

9430.24 --> 9436.76
time every day got a bit late today try

9433.399 --> 9439.96

please also do subscribe to my channel

9439.96 --> 9442.278999999999
wait

9442.399 --> 9447.88
what changing like the intro and outro

9445.64 --> 9450.599999999999
rout is like real hassle because it's

9447.88 --> 9453.119999999999
such an automated process for me I mean

9450.6 --> 9457.640000000001
I've been saying this ridd

9453.12 --> 9459.439
roughly like 1,800 times guys it's so

9457.64 --> 9460.319
automated it's really difficult to

9459.439 --> 9464.12
change

9460.319 --> 9466.319
it it really sends me into the bushes

9464.12 --> 9468.560000000001
sometimes right so uh

9466.319 --> 9470.88
normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time every day

9468.56 --> 9472.92
and please also do support me through

9470.88 --> 9475.0
the PayPal and the patreon that would be

9472.92 --> 9476.72
much appreciated and you can really

9475.0 --> 9478.16
still use the support so please keep it

9476.72 --> 9480.199999999999
coming and thanks for the little bits

9478.16 --> 9482.24
here and there the little bits here and

9480.2 --> 9486.439
there are still very helpful it still

9482.24 --> 9489.24
keeps me going right and bigger amounts

9486.439 --> 9491.92
even more right and yeah if you also

9489.24 --> 9494.96
want to see me back on

9491.92 --> 9496.84
fed I don't know if you do I'd like to

9494.96 --> 9500.24
go back

9496.84 --> 9502.880000000001
really it's just

9500.24 --> 9506.199999999999
that as some things have been

9502.88 --> 9509.64
said and uh yeah if you want to be me to

back and then everything is

9516.479 --> 9523.679999999998
fine right so I'll be back tomorrow with

9519.84 --> 9526.24
flat Earth early bird number 1840 on a

9523.68 --> 9530.56
Saturday same time same

9526.24 --> 9535.199999999999
place hope to see you all then and until
