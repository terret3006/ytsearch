good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.93 --> 47.08
early-bird number 255 this time for real

44.62 --> 49.269999999999996
yeah I started out the previous time

47.08 --> 51.879
with 55 but it was 54

49.27 --> 54.760000000000005
so anyway welcome to Flat Earth the

51.879 --> 56.41
earlybird number 255 I'm your host

54.76 --> 58.089999999999996
Arwen and before we start the show

various ways paypal superjet patreon and

74.92 --> 85.33
my GoFundMe yeah hello everyone

79.84 --> 87.34
it is freaking hot it's just not funny

85.33 --> 94.3
anymore it's it's pretty much identical

87.34 --> 96.7
weather to yesterday it's just great but

94.3 --> 101.11
not so much if you have to sit in this

96.7 --> 103.619
specific room because you get cooked the

101.11 --> 108.479
first half of the day and I did today

103.619 --> 111.429
got extremely early again I just

108.479 --> 116.289
couldn't sleep anymore from the heat not

111.429 --> 117.759
even on my not even without any sheets

116.289 --> 120.759
over me just couldn't sleep from the

117.759 --> 124.47
heat so I got some breakfast did some

120.759 --> 127.569
stuff I had a found a really nice spot

124.47 --> 134.26
over at the chimney on the on the end

127.569 --> 136.99
there on the roof yeah that was having a

134.26 --> 139.54
shadow spot that was so nice and fresh

136.99 --> 142.959
cold from the night still that it even

139.54 --> 144.76
had some moisture sitting on it so I was

142.959 --> 148.9
just sitting there in the cold shadow

144.76 --> 151.35999999999999
while it was the only cold spot and just

148.9 --> 155.20000000000002
had a nice smoke there in the morning

151.36 --> 159.88000000000002
was really nice and after that yeah I

155.2 --> 162.97
could went downstairs and just sat on

159.88 --> 165.04
our lie down on the couch there because

162.97 --> 167.549
it was a little bit cooler so I just

165.04 --> 171.57899999999998
tinea sleeping it's so freakin hot here

167.549 --> 173.469
but yeah then again my new roommate and

171.579 --> 177.549
then that moved in there it's pretty

173.469 --> 179.799
chill dude and yeah I've been sitting

177.549 --> 181.65900000000002
after that point on his balcony which is

179.799 --> 184.39000000000001
on the other side which is much nicer

181.659 --> 186.64
temperature in the mornings so that's

184.39 --> 190.29899999999998
gonna be looking forward to being able

186.64 --> 194.76
to do that more often just sit there

190.299 --> 197.889
have joined nice check with the guy I

194.76 --> 199.72
yeah he knows about Flat Earth now he

197.889 --> 203.40900000000002
started to ask some questions it was

199.72 --> 205.81
funny he was curious as to why I believe

203.409 --> 210.069
that stuff didn't go all the way into it

205.81 --> 212.019
but I did mention the the optical part

210.069 --> 215.23
about curvature how that is not actually

212.019 --> 218.079
what they claimed it is and that we see

215.23 --> 222.189
that phenomena even when we look over

218.079 --> 225.76000000000002
confirmed flat surfaces if our if the

222.189 --> 229.239
observer is the observing point is in

225.76 --> 232.409
close enough proximity to it and so ya

229.239 --> 236.129
might be able to draw him in a bit

232.409 --> 236.129
that's gonna be fun

236.879 --> 244.16899999999998
yeah after that show started so I got to

240.01 --> 251.79899999999998
Mara coffee that's it's just too hot and

244.169 --> 253.81
I got lemonade and that's it don't don't

251.799 --> 256.44
really feel like eating with this kind

253.81 --> 256.44
of heat anyway

267.78 --> 273.35999999999996
no I've never heard of that fact IRA

270.72 --> 278.82000000000005
killed a hope because it can't say that

273.36 --> 282.62
it is a fact but yeah it seems to be

278.82 --> 282.62
persisting you know this weird

284.51 --> 296.64
deconstruction of chemistry people keep

288.57 --> 298.71
on insisting on it I don't get it okay

296.64 --> 300.75
thanks a man a young for the five-dollar

298.71 --> 305.25
super chat donation no shirt and your

300.75 --> 309.69
hair down you go arwan well glad you're

305.25 --> 312.18
enjoying it it's really just because

309.69 --> 314.73
there's no other way to do it it can't

312.18 --> 317.40000000000003
survive but this kind of heat with the

314.73 --> 320.93
shirt on Oh God by the way I did my

317.4 --> 328.21999999999997
newspaper rounds yeah with the shirt on

320.93 --> 331.41
in the heat and holy [ __ ] that that was

328.22 --> 333.27000000000004
that was quite a challenge to do that

331.41 --> 335.94
and I sat through the ER was sad I

333.27 --> 339.12
walked through the challenge full out

335.94 --> 343.44
when all the way but the holy jesus I

339.12 --> 346.59000000000003
lost so much water at like the last part

343.44 --> 348.87
I literally had to just keep the

346.59 --> 351.419
newspapers away from me as I was

348.87 --> 354.54
carrying them or I would literally be

351.419 --> 356.93
dropping sweat on the papers was that

354.54 --> 356.93
hot

358.04 --> 366.33000000000004
but you had worked out finished it and

362.43 --> 369.44
it was hot glad I don't have to do that

366.33 --> 369.44
every day in this kind of heat

374.0 --> 384.449
so yeah again sorry no quantum mechanics

380.43 --> 387.3
with this heat it's just I'll talk about

384.449 --> 389.37
it sure but I'm not gonna read things

387.3 --> 393.87
can't focus with this kind of heat and

389.37 --> 398.52
to be fair in the evenings it is still

393.87 --> 400.979
too hot it's slightly less hot in order

398.52 --> 406.79999999999995
for me to be able to enjoy things at

400.979 --> 409.55
least but it's still kind of warm it

406.8 --> 412.56
throughout the night actually

409.55 --> 416.569
it was at least in this night probably

412.56 --> 416.569
gonna be the same in this night as well

424.93 --> 431.74
um let's see what did I do

433.31 --> 436.31
yesterday

439.8 --> 445.379
oh yeah I won Benjamin has another

441.69 --> 446.91
another blast it was cool oh god yeah I

445.379 --> 452.659
almost forgot about that

446.91 --> 456.87
Oh Randy fletchers Roundtable holy [ __ ]

452.659 --> 463.139
Brenda against right to hand well that

456.87 --> 465.96
was well yeah what it what it only could

463.139 --> 470.49
become a [ __ ] show a giant mess of two

465.96 --> 473.43
people that are just going at each other

470.49 --> 479.49
Randy did kind of manage it properly a

473.43 --> 481.53000000000003
pretty okay job but it would yeah I can

479.49 --> 484.349
barely even remember what it was about I

481.53 --> 487.13899999999995
just know it went all over the place and

484.349 --> 489.27
add harms and right and got very

487.139 --> 490.74
triggered and Brenda got very triggered

489.27 --> 493.969
it was just exactly what you would

490.74 --> 493.969
expect from something like that

502.54 --> 509.77000000000004
I think that's it did I did I do

507.29 --> 509.77000000000004
anything

515.54 --> 521.63
oh yeah I'm preparing a bit for Saturday

518.39 --> 526.04
because coming Saturday I'm not gonna

521.63 --> 528.4399999999999
have a early bird show so so just so you

526.04 --> 530.87
guys know because Saturday morning I'm

528.44 --> 534.9200000000001
gonna go over to my friend and I may

530.87 --> 537.13
have very early and help her out all

534.92 --> 540.68
kinds of things and meet her daughter

537.13 --> 545.15
for the first time yeah looking forward

540.68 --> 549.0799999999999
to that a lot so it's gonna be a special

545.15 --> 550.97
day out for me and yeah who knows I'm

549.08 --> 552.9200000000001
gonna enjoy seeing her again I really

550.97 --> 554.44
wonder what she is gonna look like right

552.92 --> 556.6999999999999
now

554.44 --> 562.07
last time I saw her she was still

556.7 --> 565.61
pregnant from her daughter anyway so

562.07 --> 572.1800000000001
yeah and there's some things to arrange

565.61 --> 576.94
also concerning GTI because she's coming

572.18 --> 581.41
with us at that looking forward to

576.94 --> 581.4100000000001
having her as part of the network

587.39 --> 594.23
hmm yeah more colored oh it's just

592.16 --> 600.89
typically what you'd expect it to become

594.23 --> 605.09
very messy it at points it was halfway

600.89 --> 607.75
decent and then just went red herring

605.09 --> 610.1600000000001
all over the place and just literally

607.75 --> 612.14
focusing more on the psychological

610.16 --> 614.81
tactics to try and derail one another

612.14 --> 616.4
than on actual arguments and it just

614.81 --> 618.7299999999999
went all over the place no wonder you

616.4 --> 618.73
just

628.05 --> 638.279
it is our man the Tamera coffee is not

632.339 --> 640.0200000000001
helping with the heat man as you see

638.279 --> 645.81
like literally I'm suddenly like

640.02 --> 648.3299999999999
sweating alright okay so if this

645.81 --> 650.67
heatwave persists I might have to drop

648.33 --> 656.13
Tamera coffee temporarily because it's

650.67 --> 657.17
just it's not it's not exactly what I

656.13 --> 671.7
was expecting

657.17 --> 673.17
should have known better music man I

671.7 --> 677.37
don't know exactly what the temperature

673.17 --> 685.9799999999999
is I don't have more material I think

677.37 --> 689.25
it's probably the same let's see it's 36

685.98 --> 695.2090000000001
degrees Celsius in here in Utrecht it

689.25 --> 695.209
says so yeah

714.01 --> 722.93
no not really Dave Johnson and besides a

718.82 --> 726.74
fan if I would start to use that it

722.93 --> 728.42
would it wouldn't help a lot actually it

726.74 --> 731.0600000000001
would just probably dry me out really

728.42 --> 734.03
quickly because it's gonna be blowing

731.06 --> 739.3699999999999
well warm air because there's warm air

734.03 --> 741.26
here okay so that's not super pleasant

739.37 --> 744.74
to have constant warm air being blown

741.26 --> 747.34
across your face or anything it's too

744.74 --> 747.34
warm for that

751.34 --> 754.96
oh man

760.08 --> 777.589
that Mac pie look so sad is like must be

771.3 --> 781.56
choking in this heat I give them like

777.589 --> 784.47
fresh filtered water so they and all

781.56 --> 786.18
they come constantly the the white doves

784.47 --> 787.89
and there's a whole group of them they

786.18 --> 791.51
come drinking there the Magpies come

787.89 --> 794.25
drinking there the crows come drinking

791.51 --> 796.5889999999999
so yeah they know there's there's

794.25 --> 803.12
actually fresh water here and in this

796.589 --> 803.12
weather that's really necessary to find

803.269 --> 809.07
but every field of refill the bowl

806.42 --> 811.9399999999999
probably three times a day because they

809.07 --> 816.089
just drink it all up really quickly and

811.94 --> 819.2
then one of them may also be inclined to

816.089 --> 819.2
just jump into it

826.65 --> 831.78
all right so it it seems to be hot

829.2 --> 835.2
everywhere I guess the United States

831.78 --> 839.01
included ignorant is definitely hot yeah

835.2 --> 841.74
I saw it's funny like sometimes I just

839.01 --> 845.1899999999999
go check out the channels and I checked

841.74 --> 847.61
out the news and there was a piece about

845.19 --> 851.49
the weather that is incredible heat wave

847.61 --> 853.0500000000001
it's not super record-breaking but in

851.49 --> 859.53
the last period it is pretty much like

853.05 --> 861.99
the hottest day since a while that was

859.53 --> 863.97
yesterday so I literally in the most

861.99 --> 869.21
incredible heat ever did a newspaper

863.97 --> 869.21
round yay

875.18 --> 878.18
right

879.9 --> 885.16
also looking forward to September

882.67 --> 888.52
what would this heat it's always like

885.16 --> 890.26
looking forward to a time when it's

888.52 --> 893.26
probably gonna be a little bit cooler

890.26 --> 895.87
looking forward to that anyway but also

893.26 --> 900.85
looking forward to just going to the to

895.87 --> 902.77
the convention I'm I'm curious as to who

900.85 --> 906.85
I will meet there and how many people

902.77 --> 911.23
are I will recognize and if they will

906.85 --> 911.6800000000001
recognize me and say hello that will be

911.23 --> 913.83
cool

911.68 --> 913.8299999999999
and

922.65 --> 926.73
I wonder if there's people out there

924.27 --> 931.89
that are that have like questions for me

926.73 --> 935.58
or have ideas or hey if anybody has a

931.89 --> 938.04
project concerning Flat Earth and I

935.58 --> 942.3000000000001
think I could be potentially a part of

938.04 --> 948.1999999999999
that and they'd wanted to then maybe I

942.3 --> 948.1999999999999
could get approached about that there

949.1 --> 955.5
that would be interesting I don't know

951.24 --> 958.05
maybe maybe I'm just taking it a few

955.5 --> 965.39
steps too far let's just go there for a

958.05 --> 965.39
see who's there and yeah what it's like

967.82 --> 973.4000000000001
I'll probably end up making a full

970.22 --> 977.75
report about like what I think about the

973.4 --> 981.38
quality and all that [ __ ] as to in a

977.75 --> 984.5
constructive way though a Dutch

981.38 --> 992.53
interview I might I might do that

984.5 --> 992.53
oh hello Lee okay thank you

1009.3 --> 1013.1999999999999
No oh yeah by the way talking about

1011.64 --> 1017.49
doing oh I remember now

1013.2 --> 1020.07
yeah I had a few beers yesterday after

1017.49 --> 1027.39
that newspaper round I was like okay

1020.07 --> 1028.5
screw this I need a beer I'm gonna get

1027.39 --> 1030.9
myself a beer

1028.5 --> 1032.3
so yeah I actually got six and I drank

1030.9 --> 1036.44
them all

1032.3 --> 1039.72
it wasn't even sick from it this morning

1036.44 --> 1041.3700000000001
maybe now I'm not really I don't know

1039.72 --> 1044.55
where it all went it might be because I

1041.37 --> 1048.6299999999999
just drank so much water along alongside

1044.55 --> 1051.35
that and afterwards that the overall

1048.63 --> 1054.42
impact wasn't that bad

1051.35 --> 1058.79
usually when I drink six beers I do feel

1054.42 --> 1061.3200000000002
it the next day but no I'm doing okay

1058.79 --> 1064.44
but yeah drinking with this heat can be

1061.32 --> 1066.74
can be a bit tricky wouldn't recommend

1064.44 --> 1066.74
it

1072.54 --> 1075.53
Oh God

1091.63 --> 1094.63
right

1097.91 --> 1100.91
yeah

1113.44 --> 1118.0700000000002
hmm

1115.64 --> 1121.4
right yeah well more color if you're not

1118.07 --> 1123.4099999999999
used to alcohol then indeed the impact

1121.4 --> 1127.66
especially with this heatwave is going

1123.41 --> 1127.66
to be pretty pretty heavy

1136.59 --> 1143.86
maybe I should get some kind of a fan

1140.43 --> 1151.3600000000001
well technically my air filter does have

1143.86 --> 1156.4299999999998
a fan in it but it's not really that

1151.36 --> 1158.6499999999999
strong and yeah they have to sit with my

1156.43 --> 1161.49
face right in front of it to feel

1158.65 --> 1161.49
anything from it

1172.29 --> 1181.94
yeah there's one advantage of this kind

1176.97 --> 1185.07
of heat though and that is when you I

1181.94 --> 1186.5700000000002
did it after the newspaper around and

1185.07 --> 1189.78
getting the beers and everything I just

1186.57 --> 1191.25
took a before getting before actually

1189.78 --> 1194.16
starting to drink the beers that took a

1191.25 --> 1199.95
cold shower not super cold and an icy

1194.16 --> 1201.45
cold but just not warm auto so great I'm

1199.95 --> 1205.28
probably gonna take that right after

1201.45 --> 1208.71
this as well oh geez

1205.28 --> 1211.74
really Randy aftermath show tonight with

1208.71 --> 1213.92
the rumpus oh dear god that's gonna be

1211.74 --> 1213.92
special

1220.27 --> 1226.56
hmm

1222.07 --> 1226.56
now never heard of that nickel garland

1229.17 --> 1234.8100000000002
no idea what that could be

1231.85 --> 1234.81
never heard of it

1266.5 --> 1274.89
yeah let's that's funny or funny it's

1271.69 --> 1277.78
interesting music man your theory

1274.89 --> 1280.0
music when says we live under a dome

1277.78 --> 1282.3999999999999
which leads to warming over many years

1280.0 --> 1285.88
it gets so warm that dome which is made

1282.4 --> 1291.21
from frozen gases then melts which

1285.88 --> 1297.8500000000001
floods the entire plane reset yeah

1291.21 --> 1300.159
you could be right in a way because

1297.85 --> 1302.4699999999998
that's the funny thing was about that I

1300.159 --> 1305.2
even try to put it forwards during the

1302.47 --> 1308.95
debates yesterday but the opposite

1305.2 --> 1313.02
parties didn't listen even though I was

1308.95 --> 1317.38
basically arguing for them David

1313.02 --> 1320.44
rambling on on and on but yeah that the

1317.38 --> 1323.2890000000002
logical consequence would be that the

1320.44 --> 1329.5900000000001
container or well the container for the

1323.289 --> 1332.83
gas at least would basically be ice if

1329.59 --> 1336.1299999999999
if yeah the cold level would continue it

1332.83 --> 1341.35
in a linear fashion as measured which is

1336.13 --> 1343.8090000000002
what right hand was presuming then yeah

1341.35 --> 1347.049
there would even inevitably be it would

1343.809 --> 1348.97
inevitably end up in ice that's not

1347.049 --> 1351.039
necessarily the end of it because what's

1348.97 --> 1356.049
beyond that ice and what's beyond that

1351.039 --> 1358.36
and that is another mystery if that were

1356.049 --> 1361.6299999999999
to be the case but it could be like that

1358.36 --> 1366.61
and then indeed yeah big temperature

1361.63 --> 1369.64
fluctuations could indeed melt a layer

1366.61 --> 1373.51
like if the temperature great the

1369.64 --> 1376.2700000000002
temperature influence gradient would

1373.51 --> 1379.87
shift then suddenly another layer could

1376.27 --> 1382.24
basically come undone and then start to

1379.87 --> 1385.6589999999999
fall on earth and that could in first

1382.24 --> 1390.36
instance create more pressure because

1385.659 --> 1392.679
all these solids would suddenly start to

1390.36 --> 1394.4099999999999
wine up so that's going to create more

1392.679 --> 1399.3300000000002
pressure

1394.41 --> 1404.0700000000002
and then some of it may manifest I don't

1399.33 --> 1408.059
know rain I don't know it look what is

1404.07 --> 1411.03
that ice up there is that ice it's cold

1408.059 --> 1415.53
yeah that's definitely a presupposition

1411.03 --> 1421.1689999999999
at it but that solid is that water solid

1415.53 --> 1423.539
uh it's probably super cold gas that

1421.169 --> 1425.22
just solidified in that case so mostly

1423.539 --> 1427.679
if the temperature would shift it

1425.22 --> 1431.69
wouldn't necessarily cause a flood it

1427.679 --> 1435.6000000000001
would cause a giant pressure increase if

1431.69 --> 1439.14
that setup were to be the case I don't

1435.6 --> 1444.289
see it necessarily causing a flood I

1439.14 --> 1447.539
think a flood requires other conditions

1444.289 --> 1449.6299999999999
if I would just on the spot try to

1447.539 --> 1453.6299999999999
conceptualize how that could manifest

1449.63 --> 1458.7890000000002
then it would require huge amounts of

1453.63 --> 1461.94
moisture to be in the form of gas within

1458.789 --> 1465.96
the air and then suddenly finding some

1461.94 --> 1468.48
kind of critical effect where before

1465.96 --> 1471.1200000000001
there was no particle to latch onto or

1468.48 --> 1474.299
the ionizing candy the electrical

1471.12 --> 1476.76
conditions were not suitable in order

1474.299 --> 1478.86
for the water to start condensing it

1476.76 --> 1482.19
couldn't convince and then certainly it

1478.86 --> 1484.4699999999998
triggers and almost like a giant bucket

1482.19 --> 1486.6000000000001
of water suddenly forming in the air and

1484.47 --> 1488.429
the pressure going down because all that

1486.6 --> 1492.1789999999999
gas is suddenly contracting back into

1488.429 --> 1495.69
water size pressure decrease and then a

1492.179 --> 1498.5700000000002
giant bucket of water falling on the

1495.69 --> 1502.49
entire surface of the earth could that

1498.57 --> 1502.49
be the way the flood manifested

1506.49 --> 1512.31
because that water is not gonna end up

1509.82 --> 1514.22
way up there how could it get there it

1512.31 --> 1517.35
doesn't have the right density for it

1514.22 --> 1519.6000000000001
it's already gonna solidify way before

1517.35 --> 1522.53
it reaches it presupposing the

1519.6 --> 1532.8899999999999
temperature continues in a linear rate

1522.53 --> 1538.68
the temperature drop but you guys do

1532.89 --> 1545.94
understand the concept right a lot of

1538.68 --> 1550.47
water can be mixed in with air a lot of

1545.94 --> 1552.27
it it would not automatically start

1550.47 --> 1553.95
condensing it requires certain

1552.27 --> 1559.8
conditions in order for that to happen

1553.95 --> 1564.78
so from of the factors for it to happen

1559.8 --> 1568.08
would be that it would be warmer so that

1564.78 --> 1571.37
more water could be could remain in the

1568.08 --> 1574.5
gaseous state without being lured into

1571.37 --> 1577.8
condensation again okay that's one of

1574.5 --> 1581.4
the ways so if there was persistent heat

1577.8 --> 1584.1
then a lot of moisture goods mix in with

1581.4 --> 1587.88
the air and really build up for a long

1584.1 --> 1590.58
time until the conditions would change

1587.88 --> 1592.5300000000002
and something would cause that water to

1590.58 --> 1594.21
then start compensating again that

1592.53 --> 1597.69
usually happens during well in the

1594.21 --> 1600.78
tropics so this is cyclical but what if

1597.69 --> 1603.54
that cycle suddenly was or originally or

1600.78 --> 1607.08
somehow was disrupted so that it

1603.54 --> 1608.61
wouldn't break off and cause these

1607.08 --> 1611.1599999999999
storms but it would just keep on

1608.61 --> 1614.4599999999998
accumulating like an environmental

1611.16 --> 1616.0500000000002
setting accident kind of scenario and

1614.46 --> 1618.45
then these moisture would keep

1616.05 --> 1620.3999999999999
accumulating and people be like the

1618.45 --> 1622.44
moisture in the air is extremely high

1620.4 --> 1625.6200000000001
but it's not raining why hasn't it

1622.44 --> 1627.3600000000001
rained for so long like yeah the plants

1625.62 --> 1629.3999999999999
seem to like it they can just tap it out

1627.36 --> 1631.4699999999998
of the air but it's not raining anymore

1629.4 --> 1634.3500000000001
and it keeps on the moisture level keeps

1631.47 --> 1636.06
on rising what's going on and then I

1634.35 --> 1639.1689999999999
could imagine that at some point just

1636.06 --> 1647.82
sadly it will be like

1639.169 --> 1652.289
what's happening yes maybe that is a way

1647.82 --> 1654.86
I could mechanically argue how a flood

1652.289 --> 1657.57
could have happened without some other

1654.86 --> 1659.789
compartment to literally physically

1657.57 --> 1662.1589999999999
contain the water that is how it could

1659.789 --> 1667.73
potentially manifest naturally within

1662.159 --> 1667.73
our realm wouldn't you guys agree

1676.57 --> 1682.82
magic around my neck it's just it's just

1679.88 --> 1688.929
a duel I made I've been wearing it since

1682.82 --> 1699.9399999999998
the start every single time it's like

1688.929 --> 1699.94
gold grabber II with a granite in it

1702.85 --> 1711.4599999999998
using the flexible yet sturdy nature of

1708.22 --> 1714.519
gold so that it can be used as a very

1711.46 --> 1716.529
reliable clamp so it's literally not

1714.519 --> 1719.049
physically attached and I can just walk

1716.529 --> 1723.279
around with this without risking it

1719.049 --> 1728.3799999999999
getting loose unless I purposely pull it

1723.279 --> 1736.69
out yeah designer I designed it I made

1728.38 --> 1739.5700000000002
it for me it's very easy to make jewels

1736.69 --> 1741.429
like this in general the system I could

1739.57 --> 1743.1689999999999
do this again with other things for

1741.429 --> 1756.72
other people if they wanted to I just

1743.169 --> 1756.72
eat my workshop so

1776.04 --> 1778.85
hmm

1786.69 --> 1795.3590000000002
never one well that would be extremely

1792.599 --> 1801.749
interesting I think if I got demonetized

1795.359 --> 1804.33
for as a guy to be topless on YouTube

1801.749 --> 1807.739
that that would be special don't think

1804.33 --> 1807.739
that's gonna happen anytime soon

1815.79 --> 1822.3899999999999
hey Mark taxi well what is all about me

1821.22 --> 1828.0
what are you talking about

1822.39 --> 1834.69
oh right to those who want to know the

1828.0 --> 1838.59
truth well I'm working with the

1834.69 --> 1842.66
information I have my own conclusions to

1838.59 --> 1848.34
share and I have questions to answer and

1842.66 --> 1853.8600000000001
yeah don't see if have I ever really

1848.34 --> 1856.29
failed at anything so far it's it's just

1853.86 --> 1858.6599999999999
a big development process and I've been

1856.29 --> 1861.6599999999999
part of it for a long time in the open

1858.66 --> 1865.52
for everybody to to keep track or to

1861.66 --> 1865.52
ignore as they please

1884.73 --> 1887.72
okay

1889.1 --> 1893.9499999999998
I think we got a few trolls in chat here

1907.999 --> 1923.19
all right yeah that just screwing around

1913.47 --> 1927.529
it's not even that bad right well thanks

1923.19 --> 1932.159
for at least paying attention thank you

1927.529 --> 1937.039
yeah yeah I guess that my appearance in

1932.159 --> 1937.0390000000002
this fashion will arouse a lot of trolls

1937.61 --> 1945.2589999999998
if you know what I mean mmm

1961.23 --> 1969.8700000000001
oh really really monk patrol ah you

1969.09 --> 1973.799
think so

1969.87 --> 1975.899
so that newspaper round yesterday that I

1973.799 --> 1979.889
literally make what is it

1975.899 --> 1981.899
one euro not even not even euro for each

1979.889 --> 1987.539
time I do that that I make for it I'm

1981.899 --> 1991.529
doing that for the money as well what is

1987.539 --> 1993.299
a job is it something to do is it

1991.529 --> 1996.12
something that makes money do you have

1993.299 --> 1998.76
is it required for you to do something

1996.12 --> 2001.12
in order to make that money what is a

1998.76 --> 2001.12
job

2011.04 --> 2022.5
yeah I think it's f20 band time guys so

2015.47 --> 2036.3500000000001
giving you permission to ban an ef-2 any

2022.5 --> 2036.35
sock puppets don't be such a troll Randy

2048.89 --> 2059.27
you know there used to be a time say 20

2053.42 --> 2064.88
30 years ago when men like actual men

2059.27 --> 2068.36
that weren't like what you got now out

2064.88 --> 2071.51
there a lot a lot of [ __ ] you could

2068.36 --> 2075.56
just sit there chested with one another

2071.51 --> 2081.65
maybe even arm-wrestle you know that

2075.56 --> 2087.82
kind of [ __ ] talk stuff and it wouldn't

2081.65 --> 2091.67
be gay nobody gave a [ __ ] there is no

2087.82 --> 2093.8300000000004
connection there is no kind of sexual

2091.67 --> 2100.01
trigger that's being indoctrinated on

2093.83 --> 2103.88
everybody they're literally trying to

2100.01 --> 2108.4
grow that pulse like a plant in every

2103.88 --> 2112.3900000000003
one to make you viable for being

2108.4 --> 2118.87
convinced that you're gay basically okay

2112.39 --> 2118.87
so I don't know I'm not gonna

2119.32 --> 2126.32
accommodate for that at all if you get

2123.5 --> 2128.03
triggered by me being bare-chested like

2126.32 --> 2131.75
this and I may have nipples or anything

2128.03 --> 2134.09
you know then you got a problem unless

2131.75 --> 2135.83
you're a female of course but yeah

2134.09 --> 2138.65
you're gonna not gonna say that kind of

2135.83 --> 2141.29
thing in chat in that case actually got

2138.65 --> 2144.53
a few nice remarks from people even a

2141.29 --> 2149.21
super chat so it's usually the guys that

2144.53 --> 2152.3500000000004
get all riled up about it and that's a

2149.21 --> 2156.62
sign that you got some impulses that

2152.35 --> 2159.44
well that you've apparently started to

2156.62 --> 2161.96
pay attention to and fed into and now

2159.44 --> 2163.28
that's part of you and what are you

2161.96 --> 2168.62
going to do about it are you gonna get

2163.28 --> 2170.75
gay trigger with every man that I don't

2168.62 --> 2172.16
know looks halfway decent and maybe

2170.75 --> 2174.98
bare-chested are you gonna be gay

2172.16 --> 2175.46
triggered or are you just gonna get over

2174.98 --> 2182.41
it

2175.46 --> 2185.54
and figure out what real men are like

2182.41 --> 2188.0299999999997
now I'm not giving myself as the prime

2185.54 --> 2191.3
example I am the ultimate Oh for male

2188.03 --> 2193.01
absolutely not I do my best try to

2191.3 --> 2195.6800000000003
follow the the right things but there

2193.01 --> 2198.1090000000004
are definitely issues but I have

2195.68 --> 2204.2
compared to a lot of other men that also

2198.109 --> 2207.7999999999997
have their issues that don't make me a

2204.2 --> 2210.2599999999998
prime example to everyone but at least

2207.8 --> 2214.82
in my intellectual journey I try to be

2210.26 --> 2217.5200000000004
as much as possible and so oh thank you

2214.82 --> 2220.4300000000003
by the way Leo Chi and for the $2 shop

2217.52 --> 2225.88
which a donation here's two more some

2220.43 --> 2225.8799999999997
more tea stay cool thanks

2231.53 --> 2240.9300000000003
[Music]

2237.15 --> 2243.059
all right well yeah 1.5 fault

2240.93 --> 2247.819
yeah you are typically a troll but hey

2243.059 --> 2251.9700000000003
if you're just gonna kind of act normal

2247.819 --> 2253.89
sort of normal normal enough for me then

2251.97 --> 2255.72
I have no problem you being around in my

2253.89 --> 2258.48
chat it's really when people start to

2255.72 --> 2260.7
troll and then respawn suck accounts

2258.48 --> 2262.799
when they get banned that's usually when

2260.7 --> 2265.2889999999998
I start to get annoyed

2262.799 --> 2272.64
I don't mind anyone being in my chart

2265.289 --> 2276.2400000000002
yet as long as they behave hey why

2272.64 --> 2281.18
didn't mark talks he get What did he say

2276.24 --> 2281.18
I really get a job

2283.78 --> 2292.6800000000003
really Martok see what the hell dude

2301.269 --> 2304.6299999999997
he-hello the one

2309.98 --> 2317.48
yeah that's right mark color that's what

2312.26 --> 2322.78
I'm thinking as well because it's also

2317.48 --> 2322.78
being encouraged it's being highlighted

2323.74 --> 2332.2999999999997
in culture in general social behavior

2328.49 --> 2335.5099999999998
social media it's being encouraged to be

2332.3 --> 2338.75
gay triggered like it's a thing they

2335.51 --> 2340.7000000000003
make it into a thing for men and then

2338.75 --> 2342.02
men start to think that it is a thing

2340.7 --> 2347.9199999999996
and that that's normal and then they

2342.02 --> 2352.28
attain that I'm not gonna attain that

2347.92 --> 2355.01
very aware of that kind of [ __ ] and I

2352.28 --> 2359.23
fell for it earlier because I had my own

2355.01 --> 2362.3900000000003
ideas about like yeah why not

2359.23 --> 2365.03
like there's interesting aspects about

2362.39 --> 2367.16
female characters like character traits

2365.03 --> 2369.38
that you don't typically find among

2367.16 --> 2371.27
males why not assimilate some of that

2369.38 --> 2373.13
that was my approach for me personally

2371.27 --> 2375.02
so I thought okay why do I have to

2373.13 --> 2378.2000000000003
numbed out my feelings to be all manly

2375.02 --> 2384.589
why can't I be sensitive like a kid and

2378.2 --> 2390.68
still maintain my manliness it's quite a

2384.589 --> 2393.23
task but not like Oh step away from

2390.68 --> 2396.109
being a man you got to be the exact

2393.23 --> 2398.69
opposite because that's what's really

2396.109 --> 2401.38
being pushed right now out there that's

2398.69 --> 2401.38
just ridiculous

2417.67 --> 2423.35
all right PJ that's an interesting

2420.47 --> 2425.4199999999996
question for a change what is a

2423.35 --> 2426.98
worthwhile endeavor amid all the

2425.42 --> 2429.32
deception and corruption in the world

2426.98 --> 2432.2
serious question you have a difficulty

2429.32 --> 2435.38
with that question okay well it's not

2432.2 --> 2439.49
that difficult for me it's actually

2435.38 --> 2442.04
quite simple in that world what is

2439.49 --> 2446.5099999999998
worthwhile well how about figuring out

2442.04 --> 2450.23
the truth and bypassing the deception

2446.51 --> 2452.15
but not in a way where you literally

2450.23 --> 2454.1
bypass everything because you over

2452.15 --> 2457.58
generalize and declare everything a

2454.1 --> 2460.4
deception it's literally a game what is

2457.58 --> 2464.48
true what is not true how is it not true

2460.4 --> 2467.27
where does that come from it's puzzling

2464.48 --> 2469.1
with narratives and trying to find their

2467.27 --> 2472.0099999999998
origin just like you would try to find

2469.1 --> 2473.63
the origin of words you know the

2472.01 --> 2475.07
etymology you can do that with

2473.63 --> 2480.28
narratives is what I've kind of been

2475.07 --> 2483.8900000000003
doing and that is a well worth time a

2480.28 --> 2487.3
way to spend your time in a world that

2483.89 --> 2489.89
is full of that unraveling it but

2487.3 --> 2493.1600000000003
staying focused staying honest with

2489.89 --> 2495.3799999999997
yourself and not pulling things out of

2493.16 --> 2498.08
proportion in order to make it either

2495.38 --> 2503.1400000000003
easy on yourself or to be noisy and in

2498.08 --> 2503.14
tension grabby that's the trick

2520.97 --> 2523.6899999999996
hmm

2542.44 --> 2552.1
I was poor on this and so what what do

2546.49 --> 2554.41
you mean I was pissed off at some point

2552.1 --> 2557.92
because the same girl regurgitation [ __ ]

2554.41 --> 2561.64
I'm getting sick of that Randy okay I

2557.92 --> 2566.2000000000003
don't know what what you're looking into

2561.64 --> 2568.23
or seeing you know that but I'm I'm kind

2566.2 --> 2571.27
of done with it

2568.23 --> 2573.91
people are like they're literally laying

2571.27 --> 2576.67
deception at my feet saying that what I

2573.91 --> 2578.89
experienced just doesn't exist and that

2576.67 --> 2580.9900000000002
I'm basically lying about it because

2578.89 --> 2583.2999999999997
they didn't experience it oh I have

2580.99 --> 2585.6899999999996
experienced a lot of these experiments

2583.3 --> 2588.75
proofing gas pressure and all that and

2585.69 --> 2594.43
splitting up of water into hydrogen and

2588.75 --> 2599.11
oxygen and I'm just sick of this [ __ ]

2594.43 --> 2604.48
what they're doing now Randy don't go

2599.11 --> 2607.4500000000003
there what the hell man what the hell is

2604.48 --> 2611.02
wrong with you are you seriously gonna

2607.45 --> 2616.0499999999997
go with gas doesn't exist you really

2611.02 --> 2616.05
think that's a viable course Randy

2628.25 --> 2638.79
seriously what the hell's going on with

2630.42 --> 2643.02
you man you know I have strong criticism

2638.79 --> 2647.55
in at the sense of how quantum eraser

2643.02 --> 2650.18
and Nathan deal with people okay I have

2647.55 --> 2654.3900000000003
and I do that and I keep on doing that

2650.18 --> 2656.37
that doesn't how am I supposed to

2654.39 --> 2659.8199999999997
religious follower of any of that I

2656.37 --> 2663.42
criticize them all the time I test their

2659.82 --> 2665.5800000000004
assumptions all the time on my show it's

2663.42 --> 2668.39
just no use addressing them on it just

2665.58 --> 2668.39
create fights

2669.86 --> 2681.6
exactly Colin Turner thank you it's

2678.87 --> 2684.15
worth investigating well how about

2681.6 --> 2687.72
starting with a starting point and not a

2684.15 --> 2689.7000000000003
jumbly mess like they all have the only

2687.72 --> 2694.1
claims they're making is literally

2689.7 --> 2697.0499999999997
claims from ignorance denying provable

2694.1 --> 2701.25
empirical things that can be reproduced

2697.05 --> 2703.4700000000003
it's we're literally filling in every

2701.25 --> 2707.55
question every corner and they literally

2703.47 --> 2710.64
ignore it and then continue to state we

2707.55 --> 2713.3100000000004
don't feel pressure that kind of [ __ ]

2710.64 --> 2715.35
it's nonsense rent I can't believe

2713.31 --> 2716.91
you're going with this that you think

2715.35 --> 2722.81
that's actually gonna lead something

2716.91 --> 2722.81
where where is the where is the evidence

2724.97 --> 2731.85
where is the evidence of their claim

2728.36 --> 2735.6
what is it supposed to be this claim of

2731.85 --> 2739.98
these droplets you know like they are

2735.6 --> 2741.9
micro liquid droplets really so wouldn't

2739.98 --> 2745.14
you see that are they too small to see

2741.9 --> 2748.56
does it behave like look all these

2745.14 --> 2750.75
states of all the matter are very well

2748.56 --> 2754.83
defined by their behavior and their

2750.75 --> 2757.38
response to interaction you can't just

2754.83 --> 2760.49
say oh it's micro water droplets is just

2757.38 --> 2764.75
too small to see because

2760.49 --> 2768.83
the very state and how it responds is

2764.75 --> 2770.54
what has defined it to be that state in

2768.83 --> 2772.97
the first place that is how its

2770.54 --> 2775.94
distinguished so to just say no it's

2772.97 --> 2777.859
another type of approach while

2775.94 --> 2781.089
practically not actually changing

2777.859 --> 2781.089
anything that doesn't make any sense

2782.44 --> 2789.339
it it really doesn't make any sense I've

2785.93 --> 2794.21
not heard anything from them that really

2789.339 --> 2796.52
pointed at something worth while I've

2794.21 --> 2800.03
heard some interesting analogies but

2796.52 --> 2802.0099999999998
they're just correlations mostly like

2800.03 --> 2805.73
the correlation between the gas pressure

2802.01 --> 2808.67
and the temperature which i've explained

2805.73 --> 2810.5
myself multiple times how that

2808.67 --> 2811.849
correlation is that it's not a linear

2810.5 --> 2814.79
correlation that it's not

2811.849 --> 2818.63
interchangeable one increases the other

2814.79 --> 2822.77
the other increases the one but the

2818.63 --> 2827.21
thing being increased always is ahead of

2822.77 --> 2828.41
the rise of the other factor it's never

2827.21 --> 2833.53
on the same level it's not

2828.41 --> 2836.48
interchangeable that was my argument and

2833.53 --> 2840.52
really haven't had any time with that

2836.48 --> 2844.369
whatsoever since they just keep on

2840.52 --> 2846.91
making these incomplete analogies and

2844.369 --> 2846.9100000000003
everything it's

2857.3 --> 2865.4900000000002
mark duxi what the hell is wrong with

2860.0 --> 2869.21
you man why why are you being like this

2865.49 --> 2873.77
you know I we used to just be cool

2869.21 --> 2874.85
together you know remember the times why

2873.77 --> 2877.43
are you being like this

2874.85 --> 2879.88
I don't get it I thought you were better

2877.43 --> 2879.8799999999997
than this

2906.79 --> 2915.77
yeah and for all those that seem to be

2910.16 --> 2919.04
on this anti QE camp again you know this

2915.77 --> 2922.1
weird either you are with us or you are

2919.04 --> 2928.37
against us mentality I will not stand

2922.1 --> 2931.88
for that I will not allow that to ravage

2928.37 --> 2936.71
everything for no good reason it's it's

2931.88 --> 2939.1
crazy so yeah there is stuff wrong with

2936.71 --> 2941.66
QE and I point it out

2939.1 --> 2943.79
that doesn't mean that I'm just gonna

2941.66 --> 2945.83
enjoy a bunch of loonies that are off

2943.79 --> 2949.58
the rails with their reasoning and

2945.83 --> 2951.89
applying obvious psychological tactics

2949.58 --> 2953.89
in their approach and they're not

2951.89 --> 2957.56
getting to the point and are constantly

2953.89 --> 2959.2999999999997
bound to red herring the questions I'm

2957.56 --> 2962.87
not gonna side with that group no matter

2959.3 --> 2967.07
who they oppose because that methodology

2962.87 --> 2971.42
is not part of the path it's a mistake a

2967.07 --> 2974.06
big mistake and as long as you keep on

2971.42 --> 2979.4900000000002
doubling down on that mistake you're not

2974.06 --> 2982.34
going anywhere but down I'll just keep

2979.49 --> 2984.2
on fighting my own fight and the issues

2982.34 --> 2988.3700000000003
that I have with quantum eraser and

2984.2 --> 2990.23
Nathan and if at some point I can no

2988.37 --> 2990.74
longer work together with them then I

2990.23 --> 2993.59
won't

2990.74 --> 2995.39
I will stop it and sometimes I may need

2993.59 --> 3001.1800000000003
a break and then I'll just take a break

2995.39 --> 3003.43
like last last Friday and yeah when I

3001.18 --> 3007.29
feel like it I'll go there and when I'm

3003.43 --> 3007.29
sick of it I'll leave that's it

3008.14 --> 3015.4
I don't need all this weird peer

3010.809 --> 3018.4590000000003
pressure [ __ ] either you are with us

3015.4 --> 3020.849
or you're against us well screw you in

3018.459 --> 3020.8489999999997
that case

3044.45 --> 3052.7
well that's not wrong because I was

3049.7 --> 3055.3399999999997
literally explaining what I do and I

3052.7 --> 3057.2
wasn't wrong ranty so that's a really

3055.34 --> 3060.71
weird thing to say in the first place

3057.2 --> 3063.29
and yeah I do know there are issues with

3060.71 --> 3068.51
the QE path and how they silence and how

3063.29 --> 3072.31
they break things down in a way that I

3068.51 --> 3074.9300000000003
don't really like it's not my problem

3072.31 --> 3077.24
there's nothing I can effectively do

3074.93 --> 3081.49
about it and I'm not gonna join a bunch

3077.24 --> 3085.6099999999997
of freakin ragers that are in general

3081.49 --> 3088.9399999999996
unreasonable and delusional just to try

3085.61 --> 3090.83
to break that if you really have a

3088.94 --> 3093.86
problem with it then make an alternative

3090.83 --> 3097.13
and yeah Randy you are basically doing

3093.86 --> 3099.11
that well you're not done yet let's just

3097.13 --> 3101.06
see how this works out you don't know

3099.11 --> 3105.11
what you've really engaged in yet and

3101.06 --> 3108.64
you knew that you didn't know that so

3105.11 --> 3108.6400000000003
let's just see what happens

3116.18 --> 3120.99
Wow

3118.06 --> 3120.99
how about this

3134.829 --> 3141.799
well fyodor dostoyevsky yeah you could

3138.609 --> 3144.68
you could do that I've had some nasty

3141.799 --> 3146.869
teachers in my time but you could

3144.68 --> 3152.5389999999998
actually still learn something from them

3146.869 --> 3155.449
if you could well approach them the

3152.539 --> 3159.38
right way which required some trickery

3155.449 --> 3161.359
that attitude trickery and yeah it's not

3159.38 --> 3163.4
something you don't want everybody

3161.359 --> 3172.759
you're dealing with to be like that

3163.4 --> 3175.009
absolutely but it that's not the problem

3172.759 --> 3180.249
I'm having here I already explained

3175.009 --> 3180.249
exactly what my angle to it is

3186.0 --> 3189.19
[Music]

3195.24 --> 3200.39
yeah but Hmong Patrol I'm I did that to

3198.48 --> 3204.109
mark Darcy because he is literally

3200.39 --> 3204.109
trying to attack my character

3204.74 --> 3213.1499999999996
he's just being mean and a bully for no

3209.88 --> 3215.07
reason I've done nothing to offend him

3213.15 --> 3220.619
not that I'm aware of not that he even

3215.07 --> 3222.69
shared with me so what he's doing

3220.619 --> 3224.25
there's no justification for that just

3222.69 --> 3227.19
like with right to hand oh by the way

3224.25 --> 3230.73
right to hand left new messages so keeps

3227.19 --> 3234.48
on doing it I think that's okay

3230.73 --> 3237.7400000000002
I think that's normal that's that's a

3234.48 --> 3237.7400000000002
normal person behavior

3243.69 --> 3250.89
I don't know to me that it feels one

3247.289 --> 3253.98
step away from being a stalker not

3250.89 --> 3257.96
saying that it is to get that feeling

3253.98 --> 3257.96
and definitely the obsession factor

3282.5 --> 3294.98
it's so funny saying all he literally

3290.84 --> 3298.6400000000003
spent some time yes weights today yeah

3294.98 --> 3301.369
before the show he put together a couple

3298.64 --> 3304.31
of sentences literally straw man me like

3301.369 --> 3306.6800000000003
he did yesterday trying to make me force

3304.31 --> 3309.2599999999998
me to talk about water sticking to a

3306.68 --> 3311.2999999999997
ball that kind of note he kept on straw

3309.26 --> 3315.7000000000003
Manning or gaslighting me with that [ __ ]

3311.3 --> 3318.98
and now he put it down there and then

3315.7 --> 3321.859
ends it with I love making you look

3318.98 --> 3325.46
stupid thanks for helping me so much

3321.859 --> 3327.2599999999998
with this when he's the one literally

3325.46 --> 3329.84
straw Manning me with that [ __ ] and

3327.26 --> 3338.15
bringing it up when I didn't bring it up

3329.84 --> 3340.94
it's some serious it's almost like a an

3338.15 --> 3343.369
inner monologue an inner conversation

3340.94 --> 3346.4
with a phantom version of me that he's

3343.369 --> 3350.7200000000003
having with himself presupposing

3346.4 --> 3352.9300000000003
everything that I do and it's weird it's

3350.72 --> 3352.93
creepy

3375.29 --> 3382.44
all right uh yeah white bear I think he

3380.609 --> 3384.24
did indeed the Flat Earth model in

3382.44 --> 3386.79
google blah blah blah yeah you know what

3384.24 --> 3390.4199999999996
QE has made a lot of presentations a lot

3386.79 --> 3393.92
of them and there's only very few that I

3390.42 --> 3396.48
really care about in any sort of way

3393.92 --> 3401.01
because he's done some things that are

3396.48 --> 3403.8
just like seem a bit loopy and not

3401.01 --> 3412.4300000000003
really all too relevant in my opinion

3403.8 --> 3415.5800000000004
and I'm not really too interested yeah

3412.43 --> 3415.58
you know

3438.06 --> 3443.42
[Music]

3440.39 --> 3450.2
a dome impression that's interesting yet

3443.42 --> 3456.079
is that prove an impression you do

3450.2 --> 3459.14
realize that when you actually look even

3456.079 --> 3461.2400000000002
though you kind of look like a sphere

3459.14 --> 3462.89
around you because that's the nature of

3461.24 --> 3466.0699999999997
the ice that doesn't mean that there

3462.89 --> 3468.74
isn't anything beyond that that there is

3466.07 --> 3475.94
more space beyond what you can see so

3468.74 --> 3483.3799999999997
that's yeah weird exactly the FG onsen

3475.94 --> 3485.42
doesn't make a lot of sense right so

3483.38 --> 3490.31
yeah there's a lot of complaining here

3485.42 --> 3493.7200000000003
about QE you guys really need like a

3490.31 --> 3498.2799999999997
therapy group and anti John

3493.72 --> 3503.089
post-traumatic QE therapy Center I think

3498.28 --> 3506.869
the ballers need it they need it anyway

3503.089 --> 3508.94
but I think a lot of you guys a lot of

3506.869 --> 3512.21
flat-earthers probably needed just for

3508.94 --> 3516.069
his behavior as well I don't get it why
