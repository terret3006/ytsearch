7.58 --> 41.76
[Music]

38.0 --> 45.42
good morning welcome to flatter the

41.76 --> 51.69
earlybird number 116 I'm your host

45.42 --> 57.35
Arwen and today is a dreary day so rainy

51.69 --> 57.349999999999994
and don't really mind

61.879 --> 67.07
oh yeah oh and of course today is my

64.939 --> 72.729
paper round day so that's very very

67.07 --> 72.729
typical but I don't mind yeah

76.159 --> 89.549
people in chat will yeah so I managed to

86.479 --> 92.939
do the whole window thing and I pretty

89.549 --> 97.59
much finished up 50 mins before starting

92.939 --> 101.609
his hangout so yeah I worked out really

97.59 --> 105.09
well got a little messy with the sticky

101.609 --> 108.149
stuff that stuff's nightmare even

105.09 --> 111.509
washing it off your hands just sucks but

108.149 --> 117.36
yeah it worked out great it looks fine

111.509 --> 119.819
and yeah I guess I just saved myself

117.36 --> 122.579
about a hundred and thirty euros or

119.819 --> 128.609
something so that's really nice

122.579 --> 131.84
realizing that part and yeah I was kind

128.609 --> 131.84
of interesting to do

136.099 --> 147.7
so and if you see my hangout yesterday

140.92 --> 147.7
another night owl station

149.48 --> 153.909
I remember we talked about

156.29 --> 160.4
rustle the whole

162.74 --> 168.5
yeah this it's so hard to describe it's

165.5 --> 173.3
just yeah you got to see it and get it

168.5 --> 174.35
it's ultimate duality in a way and it's

173.3 --> 176.87
just amazing

174.35 --> 179.87
but yeah during that time I was kind of

176.87 --> 184.49
drunk it's something I typically do I

179.87 --> 186.68
guess the night I'll show so I don't

184.49 --> 189.53
remember a lot of it and I I think I

186.68 --> 194.65
pretty much went to bed right after that

189.53 --> 200.48
which is extremely early for me but yeah

194.65 --> 203.93
it was pretty amazing also a realization

200.48 --> 208.03
that I like seeing it before nine years

203.93 --> 208.03
ago that's just weird

210.07 --> 214.0
what's up with the Penguins

224.94 --> 234.51
anyway and chat see you there

229.7 --> 243.54
welcome Nick leb in Adams death flaxen

234.51 --> 247.59
Voynich ute over moko DJ Adagio them

243.54 --> 254.13
exposed sassy London so yeah good to see

247.59 --> 257.58
all of you guys I'm really in for some

254.13 --> 261.81
tea but yeah you can do all that and

257.58 --> 262.89
prepare for show in 15 minutes so I'm

261.81 --> 266.24
gonna get it

262.89 --> 266.24
few minutes

274.11 --> 278.81
so yeah what's what's happening

285.479 --> 290.0
yeah

287.6 --> 294.47
you haven't sort of in this morning I

290.0 --> 298.19
was watching a bit of open Benjamin

294.47 --> 303.02000000000004
again a nerd the dome the dome in the

298.19 --> 305.75
firmament he went is pretty pretty flat

303.02 --> 312.74
earthy and then he also very interesting

305.75 --> 320.2
went into the Mandela effect again or

312.74 --> 320.2
again he went into it and yeah

320.71 --> 327.00899999999996
we recognize the same problem with it

324.34 --> 331.50899999999996
and love us and how frustrating it is

327.009 --> 335.05
and that it's very unclear as to where

331.509 --> 337.62
it's coming from what is up with these

335.05 --> 337.62
penguins

343.59 --> 353.90999999999997
I don't know who Wesley stays is I don't

348.72 --> 355.98
get why so many of you guys trolls

353.91 --> 358.889
think yeah oh yeah what do you think

355.98 --> 361.11
about this person well Arwen is usually

358.889 --> 364.11
the last person to hear about somebody

361.11 --> 368.37
so to immediately get an opinion about

364.11 --> 372.16900000000004
somebody you first gotta share with me

368.37 --> 372.169
who that person actually is

382.75 --> 387.4
strangest studio reflections

396.199 --> 403.37
now David flaxen like to be fair I don't

399.949 --> 406.18
remember you I do remember there was a

403.37 --> 406.18
David

415.36 --> 421.539
right it was like the American with the

417.699 --> 424.03000000000003
heavy accent I was very good at a trump

421.539 --> 427.289
a thing that the ballers basically at

424.03 --> 427.289
the beginning are you that guys

433.279 --> 442.489
right you're that guy hello welcome back

438.349 --> 444.969
David yeah I'm gonna get some tea so be

442.489 --> 444.969
right back

446.59 --> 450.10999999999996
[Music]

490.56 --> 493.68
[Music]

497.229 --> 503.27
looping the front door and just seeing

500.629 --> 505.78000000000003
that we know in there like nothing never

503.27 --> 505.78
happened

530.45 --> 535.74
so I've been having more complaints

533.16 --> 538.529
about my microphone because apparently

535.74 --> 544.07
it's not just the sound setting it's the

538.529 --> 547.77
microphone itself I will try to get one

544.07 --> 553.62
as soon as soon as possible we have the

547.77 --> 555.6899999999999
money yeah with all the reason to PayPal

553.62 --> 559.98
donations especially but also what's

555.69 --> 562.1700000000001
laying in wait with my super chat that I

559.98 --> 566.25
can't actually reach right now which is

562.17 --> 567.87
really frustrating I will try to get on

566.25 --> 569.52
the microphone as soon as possible

567.87 --> 574.11
because yeah it's not gonna be as

569.52 --> 580.6999999999999
expensive it's a P 900 now that's the

574.11 --> 585.36
big goal but yeah I get it and

580.7 --> 587.9100000000001
microphone shouldn't be too hard to get

585.36 --> 589.87
one that yeah doesn't make so much noise

587.91 --> 593.5899999999999
and everything

589.87 --> 593.59
that's shopping

602.72 --> 605.8290000000001
peanuts in them

606.36 --> 610.13
I rarely buy that stuff

610.66 --> 614.069
yesterday I had to

616.49 --> 623.17
oh yeah another weird realization and

619.94 --> 623.1700000000001
that makes me kind of worried

624.13 --> 626.88
again

627.23 --> 635.75
I did denied I'll show had quite a few

631.1 --> 637.28
beers for my doing six and then I went

635.75 --> 640.52
to sleep and I just didn't have any

637.28 --> 643.24
dinner at all like in the morning I

640.52 --> 648.98
would like woke up and was like okay I

643.24 --> 654.97
feel really skinny right now damn it I

648.98 --> 654.97
forgot dinner again drinking is bad

661.0 --> 665.189
I need to be a bit a bit more careful

670.99 --> 675.85
but maybe it's like the elastic effect

673.36 --> 682.96
because the day before I hadn't drunk

675.85 --> 687.089
and it felt great yesterday and then I

682.96 --> 687.089
got beers and then it got smashed

692.81 --> 700.16
Yeah right yeah I thought so too yeah

696.71 --> 705.4100000000001
beer liquid bread and hey it's organic

700.16 --> 708.3199999999999
so it's not as bad as it could be about

705.41 --> 713.75
still yeah it's only you don't get a lot

708.32 --> 716.0
of vitamins out of it but managed to

713.75 --> 718.6
compensate some of that with some

716.0 --> 718.6
supplements

718.91 --> 721.75
it does help

721.99 --> 729.28
but I wish I wouldn't be so seduced by

725.32 --> 735.58
alcohol every time and cannabis for that

729.28 --> 738.73
matter it's even annoying just talking

735.58 --> 741.7800000000001
about it you know talk is completely

738.73 --> 745.0
useless with that stuff just gotta

741.78 --> 745.63
either do it and enjoy it and then get

745.0 --> 750.15
over it

745.63 --> 757.14
or just not do it and get over

750.15 --> 757.14
that's just so I'm not gonna talk about

771.13 --> 780.04
a step-down program right yeah well in

775.93 --> 782.89
last month I my alcohol consumption had

780.04 --> 787.15
increased pretty radically four am i

782.89 --> 792.49
doing also due to the general depression

787.15 --> 794.56
like situation but yeah now that I'm

792.49 --> 799.0600000000001
getting out of it I also need to stop

794.56 --> 802.3599999999999
that doing that so I'm kind of doing the

799.06 --> 805.51
same and look I never drink a loss I

802.36 --> 808.54
just can't there there's only so much

805.51 --> 811.84
drink that can fit in Arwen after that I

808.54 --> 815.23
just go knock out or whatever this is it

811.84 --> 818.38
can't drink that much but still yeah I

815.23 --> 820.41
can't keep on pushing to that limit you

818.38 --> 820.41
know

821.96 --> 830.12
which for me usually means six beers or

825.14 --> 833.47
a bottle of wine that's it just can't

830.12 --> 833.47
have anymore just doesn't work

851.119 --> 856.179
and add four diamonds serious Nathan

860.48 --> 866.65
oh god of course for shoes

871.51 --> 878.529
yeah so if anyone anyone wants to come

875.26 --> 882.75
on the panel talk about whatever I put

878.529 --> 886.66

these groups then just tell me

913.029 --> 916.29
cannot send you a link

930.84 --> 937.39
okay Nathan yeah I know you're always

933.67 --> 940.75
busy with preparing setting up the

937.39 --> 944.6999999999999
computer so I understand you you don't

940.75 --> 944.7
have time to come on my panel it's okay

968.7 --> 978.47
okay DJ Adagio wants a chat about dreams

973.08 --> 978.47
sure you want to come on the panel

1011.67 --> 1015.56
okay I'm trying to follow what

1028.77 --> 1031.61
oh wow

1033.29 --> 1039.709
okay that sounds really fascinating did

1037.25 --> 1041.449
you add that you just said he had a very

1039.709 --> 1046.18
weird dream and five days later he

1041.449 --> 1050.42
walked into the building into the dream

1046.18 --> 1053.3
so you basically had a switch transition

1050.42 --> 1055.88
into the dark world or was the dream

1053.3 --> 1058.1599999999999
simply that building being in that

1055.88 --> 1060.3400000000001
building did you dream that how does it

1058.16 --> 1060.3400000000001
work

1063.28 --> 1065.31
ah

1072.91 --> 1080.8300000000002
are you talking about I can't follow all

1079.12 --> 1086.08
of you at the same time talking about

1080.83 --> 1088.12
different stuff yeah look the best thing

1086.08 --> 1093.25
is just come on my panel and then we can

1088.12 --> 1096.1899999999998
talk about it so because like several

1093.25 --> 1100.57
people at the same time trying to start

1096.19 --> 1103.98
a conversation that's kind of difficult

1100.57 --> 1103.98
to follow simultaneously

1112.04 --> 1115.3
they didn't

1123.36 --> 1127.85
Oh Julie Bennett

1128.22 --> 1135.659
huh okay David asks do you think flat

1133.259 --> 1141.6
earth will affect the election in 2020

1135.659 --> 1143.7890000000002
I'll bet you it will because it's

1141.6 --> 1148.98
becoming low-hanging fruits in the

1143.789 --> 1152.519
background so there's very likely gonna

1148.98 --> 1155.909
be some kind of reference one way or the

1152.519 --> 1158.19
other and look

1155.909 --> 1163.6200000000001
elections are all about it being as

1158.19 --> 1169.2
attention grab be as subhuman insanely

1163.62 --> 1172.9189999999999
possible so yeah I'll bet you there will

1169.2 --> 1179.0900000000001
be some kind of Flat Earth related issue

1172.919 --> 1179.0900000000001
or references or jokes or anything

1180.139 --> 1186.6599999999999
anything that'll

1182.91 --> 1191.16
like jolts people to pay a little bit

1186.66 --> 1196.23
more attention or to freak them out or

1191.16 --> 1199.97
you know I predict it probably like one

1196.23 --> 1206.1
of the funnier things will be just

1199.97 --> 1207.99
combining NASA things and Flat Earth but

1206.1 --> 1210.6
yeah we'll see where it goes but yeah

1207.99 --> 1216.06
with everything going on it's very hard

1210.6 --> 1218.4599999999998
to to see elections without any mention

1216.06 --> 1222.1399999999999
or reference to Flat Earth whatsoever

1218.46 --> 1225.3500000000001
it's probably gonna be a few of that I

1222.14 --> 1225.3500000000001
got a question

1225.89 --> 1232.1200000000001
all right

1228.56 --> 1237.34
well saucy London as for vaccinations

1232.12 --> 1242.7199999999998
affecting the elections yeah a lot and

1237.34 --> 1245.9499999999998
again the the climate change and g5 all

1242.72 --> 1249.26
these things and I'm being absolutely

1245.95 --> 1252.6200000000001
bombarded with those concepts from

1249.26 --> 1258.59
alternative media where I think like

1252.62 --> 1262.2199999999998
okay they they got it like these are the

1258.59 --> 1266.8999999999999
big issues like the post birth abortion

1262.22 --> 1270.26
that kind of disgusting [ __ ] all these

1266.9 --> 1273.6100000000001
main overkill subjects that are just

1270.26 --> 1279.07
there's no way to make excuses for them

1273.61 --> 1283.6999999999998
they have no logical reason to exist and

1279.07 --> 1288.71
they will all be play a part and they

1283.7 --> 1291.5
will probably be like fighting sticks in

1288.71 --> 1294.26
the political battle some people will

1291.5 --> 1300.14
pick up specific subjects and then

1294.26 --> 1305.3799999999999
champion that subject and things may

1300.14 --> 1305.38
shift also because look Paula politics

1307.59 --> 1314.59
it's it's a dance elections are like a

1311.89 --> 1317.41
dance and you dance with what you got

1314.59 --> 1319.75
and what is actually done afterwards

1317.41 --> 1326.0500000000002
yeah that's a whole different matter as

1319.75 --> 1329.2
we all have figured out pretty much it

1326.05 --> 1331.75
happens every time like try to find

1329.2 --> 1337.72
somebody that will actually do exactly

1331.75 --> 1342.73
as they promised now and that doesn't

1337.72 --> 1349.2
mean don't vote by the way it just means

1342.73 --> 1349.2
don't have your expectations up too much

1349.59 --> 1356.53
it's always going to be a balance of

1352.89 --> 1360.0700000000002
some good things and some typical

1356.53 --> 1364.6
corporate plans that are in weights that

1360.07 --> 1368.26
cannot be avoided that kind of [ __ ] so

1364.6 --> 1371.6499999999999
and yeah whether you vote or not it's

1368.26 --> 1374.22
gonna happen anyway so how do you want

1371.65 --> 1374.22
it to happen

1377.99 --> 1382.45
and that's the game that's the dance

1401.41 --> 1406.71
four in each I just do not vote look at

1404.44 --> 1411.55
what will happen nothing

1406.71 --> 1416.1000000000001
bills will run up things will break down

1411.55 --> 1416.1
and nothing

1423.98 --> 1427.45
so yeah that's all

1445.279 --> 1451.62
there's just look there's two type of

1448.289 --> 1454.3799999999999
election directions one is where most

1451.62 --> 1461.75
people care the other is where almost

1454.38 --> 1465.5590000000002
nobody cares main difference is that

1461.75 --> 1471.809
corporations will always take advantage

1465.559 --> 1477.36
when people don't care and they will try

1471.809 --> 1481.95
to steer their angle to things when

1477.36 --> 1489.6589999999999
people do care so Indians not really

1481.95 --> 1492.169
gonna matter all right no it's not not

1489.659 --> 1492.169
gonna matter

1494.21 --> 1500.8600000000001
you not voting is not gonna stop

1496.85 --> 1500.86
anything that's what I'm saying

1504.5 --> 1513.53
it's not gonna cause government to just

1507.35 --> 1518.3899999999999
stop it's gonna happen anyway voting is

1513.53 --> 1521.0
just a ritual piece of the dance if you

1518.39 --> 1523.97
want to stop the dance then you got to

1521.0 --> 1528.14
build down the dance that ritual moment

1523.97 --> 1530.72
yeah you can be in protest fruit the

1528.14 --> 1535.8400000000001
dance is still going on okay it will

1530.72 --> 1535.84
still go on so

1559.62 --> 1564.1499999999999
well yeah Cullen Turner with the dance I

1562.38 --> 1566.3090000000002
don't mean the dance of the public

1564.15 --> 1570.41
they're just the spectators in this case

1566.309 --> 1575.79
but the dance I mean corporations and

1570.41 --> 1578.63
the palate politicians they're still

1575.79 --> 1578.6299999999999
gonna do their dance

1590.64 --> 1596.88
all right that's a good point

1593.87 --> 1605.12
Sabrina Browning is a very good point

1596.88 --> 1608.5200000000002
that's the real key for me is dependency

1605.12 --> 1612.84
what makes government truly powerful is

1608.52 --> 1616.47
dependency so yeah you can say you're

1612.84 --> 1620.22
doing it wrong but yeah as long as

1616.47 --> 1622.83
you're not independent completely then

1620.22 --> 1628.23
that's just like a teenager trying to

1622.83 --> 1630.12
rebel against their parents yeah it's

1628.23 --> 1634.95
not gonna be taken very seriously as

1630.12 --> 1637.6789999999999
soon as you walk back for like oh yeah

1634.95 --> 1641.299
can you help me out for this gonna have

1637.679 --> 1644.69
some money for this you know so yeah

1641.299 --> 1648.96
being completely self-sufficient and

1644.69 --> 1651.27
doing that on a large scale and it's

1648.96 --> 1653.58
very tough and it takes time to get

1651.27 --> 1657.12
there a lot of time and you will be

1653.58 --> 1659.6899999999998
seduced along the way to get back for

1657.12 --> 1662.27
efficiency for quickness

1659.69 --> 1669.19
but yeah the more people do that and

1662.27 --> 1673.55
then band together from within a

1669.19 --> 1677.24
self-sufficient society basically there

1673.55 --> 1680.87
is like a social collective just by the

1677.24 --> 1682.91
people and their free will and just yeah

1680.87 --> 1686.3899999999999
it's good to help one another it's logos

1682.91 --> 1688.91
so self-sufficiency on a wide scale

1686.39 --> 1691.0400000000002
that's actually gonna really really

1688.91 --> 1692.66
change things and you will notice that

1691.04 --> 1696.29
the more that happens the more

1692.66 --> 1699.44
government will actually try to subvert

1696.29 --> 1703.12
that process and the and the options to

1699.44 --> 1705.65
do that because that is the real threat

1703.12 --> 1708.08
protesting is not really a real threat

1705.65 --> 1711.65
not voting is not really a real threat

1708.08 --> 1714.77
either it's actually being separate from

1711.65 --> 1718.39
the government and and truly not needing

1714.77 --> 1718.3899999999999
them anymore that is the real threat

1746.08 --> 1750.51
right now you're all making good points

1778.0 --> 1786.34
well a gem Jim makes a point everything

1781.6 --> 1790.48
that people try to do dem Devils are ten

1786.34 --> 1800.77
steps ahead it's ten steps ahead only

1790.48 --> 1804.19
because they're very systematic they can

1800.77 --> 1809.1
plan things ahead because to them

1804.19 --> 1812.26
everything is like like a flowchart like

1809.1 --> 1815.59
everything is standardized they always

1812.26 --> 1823.87
go for the default they don't really

1815.59 --> 1826.1499999999999
make real choices they just look at what

1823.87 --> 1829.3
is the technical best course of action

1826.15 --> 1832.45
and yeah there's not a lot of morals or

1829.3 --> 1837.34
anything really included it's just what

1832.45 --> 1839.74
is the most efficient what is and yeah

1837.34 --> 1845.83
what can we get away with and for how

1839.74 --> 1850.21
long then so yeah they do plan ahead a

1845.83 --> 1853.06
long time and they see things coming

1850.21 --> 1855.94
they study people they study societies

1853.06 --> 1858.73
they study even societies in the past

1855.94 --> 1861.3400000000001
and then they try to reconfirm that data

1858.73 --> 1863.29
with all the metadata now when the

1861.34 --> 1866.8
internet going on it's like huge

1863.29 --> 1871.36
studying material in how humans respond

1866.8 --> 1874.54
in a wider society and they use this to

1871.36 --> 1879.4499999999998
plan ahead because they see our

1874.54 --> 1879.45
responses and our adaptations coming

1882.97 --> 1891.34
on the other hand they're also kind of

1886.66 --> 1893.8500000000001
set so government is not very good at

1891.34 --> 1893.85
improvising

1895.99 --> 1903.159
they plan ahead but improvising is

1902.44 --> 1907.499
something else

1903.159 --> 1907.499
they suck at it a lot

1933.04 --> 1936.69
define each point

1944.429 --> 1953.169
yeah Voynich earlier said protest

1951.009 --> 1961.57
without arms is useless against police

1953.169 --> 1965.3200000000002
with arms well protest is a civil matter

1961.57 --> 1968.47
and that means that if you protest you

1965.32 --> 1973.119
do it to spread a concept bring it to

1968.47 --> 1975.97
people's attention and find a bed of the

1973.119 --> 1978.399
outraged over it and most importantly is

1975.97 --> 1980.369
signal to the government if the

1978.399 --> 1986.889
government doesn't give a [ __ ]

1980.369 --> 1991.499
obviously then it's nothing to them it's

1986.889 --> 1994.6589999999999
just a a pawn to be countered with

1991.499 --> 1997.1490000000001
autocratic forces usually police they

1994.659 --> 1998.8300000000002
just put them there it's like okay just

1997.149 --> 2004.049
wait for them to run out of steam or

1998.83 --> 2007.379
money and that's it and then protest

2004.049 --> 2011.609
becomes useless protest can be really

2007.379 --> 2014.549
good in a civil society if it's not a

2011.609 --> 2018.299
civil society it's kind of nice if it's

2014.549 --> 2022.07
still allowed but it's not gonna

2018.299 --> 2025.97
accomplish a lot unless it like really

2022.07 --> 2025.97
riles up the people

2026.46 --> 2033.8990000000001
and they go into a frenzy Pizza cute but

2030.33 --> 2037.71
then the protest is more like an intro

2033.899 --> 2041.9399999999998
phase so it's not really the same thing

2037.71 --> 2044.779
as general protesting civil Western

2041.94 --> 2044.779
protesting

2050.07 --> 2056.01
right now over McCool protests only

2053.91 --> 2060.27
works with mainstream media coverage

2056.01 --> 2061.4
now it doesn't that protest is fake it's

2060.27 --> 2067.679
a setup

2061.4 --> 2072.12
mainstream media uses things as a mind

2067.679 --> 2074.4
control maneuvering ability so they say

2072.12 --> 2076.95
look this is protest and that means it

2074.4 --> 2079.05
is important because we say so and we

2076.95 --> 2082.5
have the widest reach and the most money

2079.05 --> 2085.6200000000003
and people not a lot these days but

2082.5 --> 2087.84
people fall for that [ __ ] so yeah it

2085.62 --> 2093.96
doesn't really matter what mainstream

2087.84 --> 2096.1200000000003
media covers it's it's not really

2093.96 --> 2098.12
relevant to what they cover it's they

2096.12 --> 2102.54
just use everything to try to

2098.12 --> 2105.7799999999997
mind-control steer things around and for

2102.54 --> 2107.97
certain thinking ways on the people that

2105.78 --> 2109.98
watch them that's all they do

2107.97 --> 2112.2599999999998
doesn't really matter if something is

2109.98 --> 2114.06
covered by the mainstream media because

2112.26 --> 2116.3700000000003
the subjects gonna be completely

2114.06 --> 2119.79
irrelevant to the mainstream media they

2116.37 --> 2124.1099999999997
don't really care they only care if it

2119.79 --> 2127.17
fits their narrative in their moments so

2124.11 --> 2130.77
they can abuse it to push more mind

2127.17 --> 2136.65
control so having mainstream coverage is

2130.77 --> 2138.15
usually not very good and these days if

2136.65 --> 2139.9500000000003
you have a lot of mainstream coverage

2138.15 --> 2142.65
you just get a lot of suspicious people

2139.95 --> 2145.14
that are like are you in some kind of

2142.65 --> 2148.26
political agenda here that you're so

2145.14 --> 2151.5
mainstream have you been paid by the

2148.26 --> 2157.3
Jews and that kind of [ __ ] starts happen

2151.5 --> 2163.68
so this you know

2157.3 --> 2163.6800000000003
now mainstream media it's just it's

2164.049 --> 2170.259
there but should dancing clown puppets

2167.549 --> 2176.38
they're not they're not really regarded

2170.259 --> 2179.289
as the news anymore anyway everybody

2176.38 --> 2185.17
goes to alternative sources for for the

2179.289 --> 2188.289
news everybody except for really really

2185.17 --> 2193.089
seriously indoctrinated people that are

2188.289 --> 2200.1400000000003
just too afraid to step step outside of

2193.089 --> 2204.67
a rigid narrative even though it doesn't

2200.14 --> 2210.609
make any damn sense anymore just too

2204.67 --> 2211.029
afraid to step away the chocolates

2210.609 --> 2213.929
saying

2211.029 --> 2213.929
morning

2220.12 --> 2224.58
ah I'm eating Chuck

2236.19 --> 2239.869
yeah Joker urinate

2266.99 --> 2274.8199999999997
that's a good point there you'd it's

2269.45 --> 2278.4399999999996
fascinating how that works and it kind

2274.82 --> 2278.44
of already is happening

2280.79 --> 2290.7799999999997
there's like for example God how do you

2285.89 --> 2293.18
say it's like one government could be

2290.78 --> 2299.6600000000003
doing several things at the same time

2293.18 --> 2302.24
and in one like intervention situation

2299.66 --> 2305.75
they are pushing for they're gonna

2302.24 --> 2309.3799999999997
emphasize like yeah we're taking away

2305.75 --> 2311.18
their slavery or this they can treat

2309.38 --> 2315.77
their citizens like this and the

2311.18 --> 2318.68
government needs to change and then try

2315.77 --> 2321.47
to get in there push things around get

2318.68 --> 2324.3199999999997
allies in the surrounding while at the

2321.47 --> 2329.93
same time simultaneously in another part

2324.32 --> 2333.38
of the world they're basically messing

2329.93 --> 2336.5899999999997
around and suddenly like conflicts start

2333.38 --> 2340.31
to break out that kind of [ __ ] and

2336.59 --> 2343.73
you'll never hear the media that is like

2340.31 --> 2346.61
on this the mainstream media on the side

2343.73 --> 2349.01
of that government you'll never hear

2346.61 --> 2350.81
them mention it or barely they'll just

2349.01 --> 2353.2700000000004
give it a side note though they'll not

2350.81 --> 2354.95
lay out the connections that are really

2353.27 --> 2357.65
there that tie back into the government

2354.95 --> 2362.4199999999996
now they all specifically emphasize the

2357.65 --> 2367.28
more noble cause and this is happening

2362.42 --> 2373.63
right now and almost all the governments

2367.28 --> 2373.63
do this it's heavily politicized

2374.19 --> 2377.88
and yet

2378.25 --> 2384.43
and the same goes for technology

2381.84 --> 2389.13
situations as well is there's a certain

2384.43 --> 2389.1299999999997
type of technology being implemented

2390.36 --> 2396.88
then yeah the country that's not

2394.57 --> 2399.46
implementing it there will be a lot of

2396.88 --> 2404.25
protest against it and people will be

2399.46 --> 2407.08
loud this is bad and like yeah like 5g

2404.25 --> 2411.04
cell towers and that technology it's

2407.08 --> 2414.15
highly dangerous so as long as the

2411.04 --> 2417.91
country is not directly implementing it

2414.15 --> 2420.64
forcefully somehow then yeah the media

2417.91 --> 2422.5
or the alternative media and maybe the

2420.64 --> 2424.54
mainstream media will pick up that

2422.5 --> 2429.19
there's like we're protest while in a

2424.54 --> 2431.74
country where it is being implemented it

2429.19 --> 2433.62
will be they will try to silence it they

2431.74 --> 2438.12
will try to squeeze it in the corner

2433.62 --> 2440.95
it's how it works it's all manipulated

2438.12 --> 2445.8399999999997
depending on the agenda of what is

2440.95 --> 2447.9399999999996
happening at the time because if you're

2445.84 --> 2450.94
not implementing a specific technology

2447.94 --> 2454.51
or agenda then it is actually really

2450.94 --> 2460.21
efficient to let the people complain

2454.51 --> 2464.7700000000004
about it because that gives a sense of

2460.21 --> 2471.52
freedom and a release valve it's it's

2464.77 --> 2475.95
super efficient that way but yeah it all

2471.52 --> 2480.67
relates to what a government is gonna do

2475.95 --> 2483.93
in how they channel we are what type of

2480.67 --> 2483.9300000000003
subjects come afloat

2491.17 --> 2497.44
that's right China is doing all kinds of

2494.84 --> 2501.11
things it's so weird because of their

2497.44 --> 2503.6
communism but yeah there's their

2501.11 --> 2508.88
problems they have serious control freak

2503.6 --> 2513.86
issues the social score thing is

2508.88 --> 2516.55
terrifying and they're doing it but at

2513.86 --> 2519.26
the same time there are like

2516.55 --> 2524.4500000000003
technological enhancement and improving

2519.26 --> 2528.98
things and air quality systems that are

2524.45 --> 2531.23
being implemented and you'll never never

2528.98 --> 2535.4900000000002
never never hear it

2531.23 --> 2537.01
from the American media they're just not

2535.49 --> 2540.6499999999996
gonna talk about it because it's like

2537.01 --> 2542.3900000000003
they're just freakin jealous so they

2540.65 --> 2544.55
don't want to talk about it because yeah

2542.39 --> 2546.2
they don't have a centralized government

2544.55 --> 2549.23
that's just gonna say okay we're gonna

2546.2 --> 2552.5299999999997
implicit is now it's gonna be down now

2549.23 --> 2554.69
you're gonna do it we're doing it no

2552.53 --> 2558.5600000000004
they can't do that because you parties

2554.69 --> 2561.68
in Congress view it and that's yeah so

2558.56 --> 2563.6
you'll never hear it from them that in

2561.68 --> 2565.46
another country that's their competitor

2563.6 --> 2566.77
there's actually really awesome things

2565.46 --> 2571.09
happening as well

2566.77 --> 2571.09
it's bizarre how this works

2577.73 --> 2580.87
it's yeah

2581.65 --> 2588.9
every system has advantages and

2583.96 --> 2592.2400000000002
disadvantages the trick is to try to

2588.9 --> 2594.539
overcome the disadvantages in the system

2592.24 --> 2594.5389999999998
you got

2595.8 --> 2598.01
and

2598.75 --> 2608.17
that's it try to learn from one another

2601.72 --> 2610.0299999999997
hopefully actually help one another but

2608.17 --> 2612.869
that's the one thing that's the biggest

2610.03 --> 2615.6090000000004
problem is that the government's in

2612.869 --> 2617.88
competition with one other rarely help

2615.609 --> 2621.42
each other out where they really can

2617.88 --> 2625.06
when they should because if they do

2621.42 --> 2630.359
country will stabilize or become more

2625.06 --> 2636.75
efficient and less likely a jeté tit and

2630.359 --> 2636.75
in search of war but yeah unfortunately

2637.05 --> 2643.7200000000003
the high ups they don't want to do it

2641.07 --> 2646.3900000000003
they don't want it they don't want to

2643.72 --> 2650.109
share their toys they wanted for them

2646.39 --> 2652.48
and they want the other toys and they

2650.109 --> 2656.609
don't want them to have it it's really

2652.48 --> 2656.609
annoying how that works

2667.34 --> 2673.79
it's weird you know I have some

2669.83 --> 2675.65
suspicions about the 5g thing it's it's

2673.79 --> 2679.36
probably much more dangerous than we

2675.65 --> 2683.51
even realized because it's not like a a

2679.36 --> 2686.06
standard hazard you know like okay you

2683.51 --> 2688.28
have five key that means that everything

2686.06 --> 2692.27
is gonna be in a constant microwave no I

2688.28 --> 2695.03
don't think that's the case but I think

2692.27 --> 2697.67
that is a possibility and that is

2695.03 --> 2700.6000000000004
perhaps even more dangerous because it

2697.67 --> 2702.62
means that 5g could be slowly slowly

2700.6 --> 2706.61
implemented people would be using it

2702.62 --> 2709.1
will be working great until for some

2706.61 --> 2711.65
reason some party in control decides

2709.1 --> 2716.5699999999997
okay now we're gonna do this with it and

2711.65 --> 2720.08
suddenly everywhere some influences like

2716.57 --> 2722.84
people could die or like start to become

2720.08 --> 2725.75
mind control or weird [ __ ] out of

2722.84 --> 2728.63
nowhere that's it's not something that's

2725.75 --> 2731.0
gonna be there from the start oh my god

2728.63 --> 2734.71
because that doesn't work no it's gonna

2731.0 --> 2738.74
be an option to them that's the problem

2734.71 --> 2742.1
and if 5g is Oh total hardship

2738.74 --> 2744.35
it is so superfluous because everything

2742.1 --> 2748.1
we got now all the internet capabilities

2744.35 --> 2752.6
they're way way beyond anything we'll

2748.1 --> 2755.63
ever need okay we got so much room with

2752.6 --> 2759.62
the internet so much speed you gotta

2755.63 --> 2762.44
like make a real effort to there yeah so

2759.62 --> 2765.2
to run short on internet speed these

2762.44 --> 2766.36
days or you gotta have like really

2765.2 --> 2769.7599999999998
shitty cable

2766.36 --> 2772.1
bad connection but the problem is is

2769.76 --> 2776.3900000000003
that many of these internet relaying

2772.1 --> 2779.68
systems are being perfect purposely

2776.39 --> 2784.31
strangled they're being artificially

2779.68 --> 2787.3999999999996
closed off to create artificial Internet

2784.31 --> 2789.47
scarcity like oh we're running out of

2787.4 --> 2791.69
internet speed the pipes are getting

2789.47 --> 2799.58
clogged this is [ __ ]

2791.69 --> 2804.35
it's all unnecessary and this has been

2799.58 --> 2807.89
officially even proven that yeah

2804.35 --> 2811.31
companies technological technology

2807.89 --> 2813.92
companies do this Apple was proven to do

2811.31 --> 2817.7
this they'd have perfectly working

2813.92 --> 2822.73
systems and then they'd give you updates

2817.7 --> 2825.68
and suddenly it doesn't work anymore ah

2822.73 --> 2828.13
you have to buy the new system because

2825.68 --> 2833.54
if the old one is outdated yeah that's

2828.13 --> 2835.6400000000003
that's happening that's corporates evil

2833.54 --> 2838.85
policy and it's happening and it's

2835.64 --> 2844.91
happening with the Internet as well it's

2838.85 --> 2848.0
[ __ ] it's all [ __ ] we don't need

2844.91 --> 2849.98
it nobody really needs it the

2848.0 --> 2853.1
controllers need it because they want to

2849.98 --> 2855.5
have this power in the background that

2853.1 --> 2857.36
they can apply any moment that's the

2855.5 --> 2860.3
only reason it's really coming because

2857.36 --> 2864.4900000000002
we don't need it at all at all

2860.3 --> 2864.4900000000002
for what reason whatsoever

2866.94 --> 2874.98
right things of the nature yeah they

2871.049 --> 2880.0389999999998
just want to kill us well they just want

2874.98 --> 2884.089
to be able to kill us it's a control

2880.039 --> 2884.0890000000004
controllers they want control

2892.88 --> 2901.7690000000002
it's just control freakishness too much

2896.46 --> 2907.049
power like too much power in general and

2901.769 --> 2911.779
it turns people into control freaks they

2907.049 --> 2916.069
want more just because there is too much

2911.779 --> 2916.069
and all that's left is more

2928.73 --> 2933.239
right

2930.809 --> 2934.409
well they think that they don't need us

2933.239 --> 2936.809
but they're wrong

2934.409 --> 2938.9990000000003
they're totally wrong they have no idea

2936.809 --> 2942.8390000000004
look they have all this control but they

2938.999 --> 2945.089
don't really understand how it they

2942.839 --> 2950.069
understand the mechanisms but they don't

2945.089 --> 2952.529
understand that all of it actually only

2950.069 --> 2956.15
really works because there are so many

2952.529 --> 2959.4
humans to keep it working

2956.15 --> 2964.309
they think oh yeah I can do it all

2959.4 --> 2968.969
[ __ ] [ __ ] its total horseshit I

2964.309 --> 2971.8190000000004
don't think any robotic society could

2968.969 --> 2975.39
ever exist without humans as part of

2971.819 --> 2977.719
maintenance at any point I don't think

2975.39 --> 2977.719
it's possible

2987.66 --> 2990.2599999999998
yeah

3002.27 --> 3011.5
right the future with the flying cars

3006.97 --> 3014.24
well you know it's possible but not very

3011.5 --> 3016.94
pragmatic because yeah look at all the

3014.24 --> 3019.0299999999997
idiots out there and flying cars either

3016.94 --> 3023.51
they are not really gonna be flying cars

3019.03 --> 3028.52
they're just going to be flying compart

3023.51 --> 3032.2000000000003
train compartment systems more like that

3028.52 --> 3032.2
movie that the really good movie

3035.32 --> 3039.31
about the name with the

3039.96 --> 3047.4
with the cops that actually saw things

3043.14 --> 3051.359
coming in the future like pre-crime

3047.4 --> 3052.6800000000003
what was that movie's name again it was

3051.359 --> 3056.66
really good anyway

3052.68 --> 3059.66
that type of flying car basically or

3056.66 --> 3059.66
because

3060.8 --> 3067.3700000000003
yeah freedom and that kind of capability

3063.97 --> 3069.98
will ya that requires everyone to be a

3067.37 --> 3072.5299999999997
Minority Report that's the one but you

3069.98 --> 3075.5
have flying cars and the freedom to use

3072.53 --> 3080.9500000000003
it is gonna require everyone to be

3075.5 --> 3084.38
basically as proficient as a pilot and

3080.95 --> 3087.71
there's too many stupid people we're

3084.38 --> 3090.62
next no it's for that it's just too

3087.71 --> 3092.6
dangerous unless yeah it's fully

3090.62 --> 3095.27
automated and then it becomes more like

3092.6 --> 3097.97
a flying compartment compartment

3095.27 --> 3100.43
railroad system where you don't really

3097.97 --> 3104.3599999999997
have control over the car so it's not a

3100.43 --> 3110.06
lot of fun that it's a flying taxis no

3104.36 --> 3114.8
god fine taxi drones weird but yeah on

3110.06 --> 3118.07
the other hand you know flying personal

3114.8 --> 3121.34
skateboard [ __ ] it's already it already

3118.07 --> 3125.6000000000004
exists I want one or I want to use one

3121.34 --> 3131.6200000000003
one time probably very dangerous but

3125.6 --> 3131.62
yeah there's video of that it's amazing

3132.24 --> 3135.7999999999997
see if I can find it again

3137.58 --> 3143.119
I showed it before

3140.369 --> 3143.119
yeah

3147.769 --> 3151.0389999999998
[ __ ] so much

3156.34 --> 3164.78
but back to the future skateboards are

3159.32 --> 3169.6090000000004
for [ __ ] compared to this seriously

3164.78 --> 3175.96
you know what I'll think of I just

3169.609 --> 3175.96
presented because I want to see

3184.93 --> 3188.43
I'm gonna show the whole thing

3204.19 --> 3215.15
yeah started the video okay hold on I'm

3209.71 --> 3219.46
switching around ah

3215.15 --> 3219.46
three screens right

3220.47 --> 3228.31
[Music]

3228.39 --> 3231.799
the pker the party with wine

3232.5 --> 3236.68

[Music]

3239.13 --> 3244.84
got the lights on green and we change

3241.799 --> 3246.54
the same because Soh is the team

3244.84 --> 3250.81
[Music]

3246.54 --> 3253.5
speed throwing whoops like on the tree

3250.81 --> 3253.5
you just already

3254.69 --> 3272.68
[Music]

3273.369 --> 3279.69
if she rode me she attendees cream of

3276.309 --> 3279.69
the crop top part of me

3279.93 --> 3284.1299999999997
says hi place it down properly you and

3282.509 --> 3286.999
your joke get off my property

3284.13 --> 3286.9990000000003
I own everything

3288.6 --> 3292.11
to the gang you know wedding ring

3290.58 --> 3294.4
sipping through this paper calling

3292.11 --> 3297.4500000000003
magazine

3294.4 --> 3302.11
I'm ready for

3297.45 --> 3302.1099999999997
[Music]

3302.809 --> 3315.289
yeah yeah watch the whole video but man

3308.869 --> 3316.589
every time I see that like holy [ __ ]

3315.289 --> 3321.329
yeah

3316.589 --> 3322.979
copyright maybe I don't know just showed

3321.329 --> 3323.8390000000004
a minute of it it's just freaking

3322.979 --> 3329.239
awesome

3323.839 --> 3329.239
and it's not fake no it's not

3330.019 --> 3334.3689999999997
it's freaking expensive though

3347.73 --> 3350.72
really

3356.63 --> 3363.92
all right well if you source that [ __ ]

3359.99 --> 3366.56
to me that's fine if you can prove it

3363.92 --> 3368.66
that is fake it looked pretty damn real

3366.56 --> 3371.11
to me and from what I saw from the

3368.66 --> 3374.1099999999997
device it didn't really look that

3371.11 --> 3374.11
complicated

3380.91 --> 3389.97
I don't think it's fake I think it's

3383.249 --> 3392.0989999999997
probably using very high-tech stuff in

3389.97 --> 3395.64
it that's not really that open like the

3392.099 --> 3401.4
same kind of jet engine technology used

3395.64 --> 3403.47
in jumbo jets in the small skill and

3401.4 --> 3405.589
then you could do this kind of [ __ ] I

3403.47 --> 3408.509
know you can

3405.589 --> 3410.819
you know those engines in those big

3408.509 --> 3413.22
planes they basically make the whole

3410.819 --> 3416.999
thing levitate with that freaking weight

3413.22 --> 3417.569
so what's what's to stop you from doing

3416.999 --> 3421.319
that

3417.569 --> 3424.13
to just the human it's it's brilliant I

3421.319 --> 3424.13
think it's real

3430.93 --> 3438.8999999999996
yeah I'm not claiming a scientific

3433.63 --> 3441.46
hypothesis Elvis who for rock courage

3438.9 --> 3443.38
I'm just saying this is real I think

3441.46 --> 3447.21
it's real I think it's a real device I

3443.38 --> 3452.8900000000003
think you can actually like hire them to

3447.21 --> 3457.21
do that and I am gonna damn well try it

3452.89 --> 3459.069
since that gets in some kind of

3457.21 --> 3462.52
financial reach that might take a few

3459.069 --> 3467.46
years but I damn well want to try for

3462.52 --> 3467.46
sure because it looks freakin awesome

3472.07 --> 3475.2400000000002
no you can

3476.079 --> 3482.049
now it's not practical it's not supposed

3479.049 --> 3484.259
to be the standard transportation to

3482.049 --> 3488.229
your job you freaking idiots it's

3484.259 --> 3491.7690000000002
supposed to be like a holiday experience

3488.229 --> 3498.279
thing of course it's not efficient or

3491.769 --> 3501.3999999999996
practical the [ __ ] yeah jet skis are not

3498.279 --> 3509.829
very practical to go to work yeah duh

3501.4 --> 3511.299
cuz that's not what they're for no I

3509.829 --> 3514.599
can't prove it's real

3511.299 --> 3519.63
but yeah I will then well try at some

3514.599 --> 3519.63
point someday maybe if I'm lucky

3523.9 --> 3531.099
all right so yeah you guys can all go no

3527.619 --> 3534.099
Sophie good fake fake no no look it's

3531.099 --> 3536.619
this you go in fighting over that [ __ ] I

3534.099 --> 3541.059
made my mind up this is real

3536.619 --> 3544.15
I consider it real and I'm gonna try to

3541.059 --> 3548.71
find out if it is real because that it's

3544.15 --> 3551.4100000000003
that cool and I've seen a lot of like

3548.71 --> 3553.869
faked videos where they try like flying

3551.41 --> 3557.859
[ __ ] hoverboard [ __ ] then you could

3553.869 --> 3562.48
always see this is too much it's too

3557.859 --> 3564.999
much it's not CGI'd at all anyway that

3562.48 --> 3565.42
has nothing to do what we were talking

3564.999 --> 3569.0789999999997
about

3565.42 --> 3571.15
yeah it kind of was flying stuff flying

3569.079 --> 3573.549
cars like who needs a freaking flying

3571.15 --> 3575.6800000000003
car when you can look like a personal

3573.549 --> 3578.619
flying craft and just get it out of your

3575.68 --> 3582.49
system like yeah you can flick and fly

3578.619 --> 3585.4
now enjoy it then you're over it and you

3582.49 --> 3587.7099999999996
don't have to make society in something

3585.4 --> 3590.17
crazy because you demand to see flying

3587.71 --> 3593.339
stuff no you can just get it out of your

3590.17 --> 3593.339
system I think it's genius

3613.359 --> 3615.989
yeah

3615.99 --> 3620.1299999999997
you're gonna give me any more of the

3617.43 --> 3623.0099999999998
[ __ ] I'm gonna bend the [ __ ] out of you

3620.13 --> 3626.13
all so be happy I'm just timing you out

3623.01 --> 3628.3190000000004
but if you're gonna go and put that kind

3626.13 --> 3629.13
of attitude to me then you can go screw

3628.319 --> 3634.5
yourself

3629.13 --> 3637.17
okay I'm not trying to convince you

3634.5 --> 3639.66
something that is fake to be Rea real

3637.17 --> 3642.51
what I'm saying is I've looked into this

3639.66 --> 3647.19
on the on the surface into these

3642.51 --> 3651.2990000000004
companies and I believe that they leave

3647.19 --> 3654.119
uh it's real I don't have scientific

3651.299 --> 3657.47
evidence I'm not saying you should

3654.119 --> 3660.359
believe it I believe it and I wants it

3657.47 --> 3663.77
so if you don't like it go screw

3660.359 --> 3663.77
yourself and piss off

3674.109 --> 3676.68
yeah

3681.34 --> 3685.94
yeah

3684.02 --> 3688.73
if you're gonna [ __ ] with me you will

3685.94 --> 3691.82
get banned so I don't know if it's worth

3688.73 --> 3695.42
it to you or if you're so easily trigger

3691.82 --> 3697.28
will that whoa if that gets me burned

3695.42 --> 3701.89
then I will get banned well

3697.28 --> 3701.8900000000003
yeah get banned you know go get banned

3701.98 --> 3710.42
because I'm sick of this attitude like

3705.47 --> 3712.0989999999997
people don't you don't do that if you do

3710.42 --> 3713.9
if you do that [ __ ] you're not my friend

3712.099 --> 3717.4900000000002
I don't want you in here if you're gonna

3713.9 --> 3717.4900000000002
have that kind of attitude to me okay

3722.69 --> 3727.79
absolutely out if he hit is boy toys you
