242.599 --> 247.54899999999998
I don't know what is a bit tired I think

245.329 --> 249.469
but yeah and the other hand yeah

247.549 --> 251.269
yesterday I started out like that due to

249.469 --> 256.489
and that turned out to be a great

251.269 --> 258.889
hangout so I don't know how my mood

256.489 --> 262.60999999999996

258.889 --> 272.5
that telling for how the Hangout will

turn out right

272.57 --> 278.05
yeah I didn't make much notes yesterday

274.58 --> 278.05
I don't know I was just tired luck

279.04 --> 284.48
afterward like after the after my

282.83 --> 287.35999999999996
newspaper rounds pretty much after the

284.48 --> 289.43
Flat Earth debate but also after

287.36 --> 291.83000000000004
yesterday's hangout was pretty intense I

289.43 --> 297.62
didn't watch it all back but it was

291.83 --> 303.53
pretty intense and just tired me out

297.62 --> 312.53000000000003
afterward I think right oh yeah yeah

303.53 --> 315.83
yeah that well there was a sorry guys

312.53 --> 321.46999999999997
this is plastic all right so there was a

315.83 --> 324.4
Benjamin yesterday it was okay maybe

321.47 --> 327.83000000000004
more continuation of the same themes and

324.4 --> 330.14
a lot about bacteria of course the idea

327.83 --> 331.78999999999996
and speculating and like what is the

330.14 --> 334.88
vision of bacteria and all the head and

331.79 --> 339.85
other people's insights and musical

334.88 --> 339.85
contributions right and after that I

348.74 --> 354.199
a conversation with my dad I think no

351.53 --> 357.94899999999996
wait that was in the morning I've been

354.199 --> 361.34000000000003
doing write newspaper about uh

357.949 --> 363.53000000000003
right then watch the movie on that flex

361.34 --> 365.38899999999995
wonder there I didn't even need to watch

363.53 --> 367.94
it on Netflix but it just popped up and

365.389 --> 371.12
I thought like yeah let's do that right

367.94 --> 374.06
now so I watched Hot Fuzz again and it

371.12 --> 376.849
is a really awesome movie I like the

374.06 --> 384.71
character a lot the main character and

376.849 --> 387.38
it's so it's so proud and forceful like

384.71 --> 390.58
in a just a very gratifying way the

387.38 --> 396.919
whole movie it is such an action movie

390.58 --> 399.05
right other than that didn't do much did

396.919 --> 403.03
got about too late pretty early actually

399.05 --> 403.03000000000003
thought I needed it and I did

413.05 --> 420.07
yeah tried to continue on my book today

416.62 --> 422.05
but I got I already got stuck so I have

420.07 --> 427.71999999999997
to figuring things out and I've been

422.05 --> 429.97
kind of like this morning I had like a

427.72 --> 433.6
certain song in my mind and I didn't

429.97 --> 436.90000000000003
know exactly where it came from but I

433.6 --> 439.96000000000004
know it was related to a game or like

436.9 --> 444.82
either bhavish gate or Neverwinter and

439.96 --> 449.28999999999996
that happen really like you could almost

444.82 --> 451.78
state that those games are primarily

449.29 --> 454.24
about the music and of course the

451.78 --> 457.75
storyline and the detail work but it is

454.24 --> 459.43
really the music and and the story and

457.75 --> 460.99
how well they are attuned and the

459.43 --> 464.65000000000003
atmosphere of the muse is just

460.99 --> 467.11
unbelievable so I've been dwelling on

464.65 --> 471.72999999999996
that and trying to kind of reflect it on

467.11 --> 475.24
like me what am I gonna do here what is

471.73 --> 480.49
it my part in this world besides talking

475.24 --> 487.23
about cosmo genies and all that do we

480.49 --> 490.45
have anything other than that I hope so

487.23 --> 493.45000000000005
now in a way I kind of always had been

490.45 --> 496.69
longing to be able to make or compute or

493.45 --> 500.56
compose music but it never touched it

496.69 --> 502.96
really never really did I guess maybe

500.56 --> 506.89
mainly because it's just the music just

502.96 --> 509.65
enchants me too much so I can't really

506.89 --> 512.11
focus on the design in itself I'm just

509.65 --> 516.42
like every time I just get in and throw

512.11 --> 516.42
by the music itself it's tough

520.94 --> 526.9000000000001
ah miss Marchant Oberg

535.089 --> 537.899
hmm

546.31 --> 549.1199999999999
hmm

555.38 --> 560.75
oh right I also had computer issues now

558.68 --> 563.2099999999999
I remember it was even during Owen

560.75 --> 565.64
Benjamin but I meant to fix it it's just

563.21 --> 567.5
that if he thought at one point that I

565.64 --> 569.33
would have to replace a part of my

567.5 --> 572.09
computer because the fan just kept on

569.33 --> 573.8000000000001
making damn amount of noise it's already

572.09 --> 575.33
worried like oh no I'm not gonna have to

573.8 --> 578.3599999999999
sit through the early bird show with

575.33 --> 584.0200000000001
that right but I managed to fix it thank

578.36 --> 584.02
God so it's quiet once again

606.07 --> 608.5500000000001
pen

608.85 --> 618.389
okay now finally you read 1984 you never

611.309 --> 620.299
read that okay so we had I get the

618.389 --> 622.859
feeling like I skipped something

620.299 --> 624.329
sometimes I watch things on Netflix and

622.859 --> 627.2990000000001
then I just forget about it

624.329 --> 634.789
that I actually watched it and yeah what

627.299 --> 638.4789999999999
I wasn't exactly a a great system for

634.789 --> 638.479
remembering what you've watched

644.32 --> 653.2900000000001
although yeah I do add things to my list

647.68 --> 659.16
at least see gonna skip something I feel

653.29 --> 659.16
like I skipped something maybe not

660.24 --> 665.89
anyway

662.03 --> 665.89
[Music]

692.73 --> 698.04
I think I know why I'm feeling like a

695.46 --> 700.5
bit wobbly right now and that causes me

698.04 --> 702.3
to kind of silence because it's like I

700.5 --> 705.78
go into waiting mode until it like

702.3 --> 707.6999999999999
passes so that I can like really start

705.78 --> 714.2099999999999
up my energy you know that and it's

707.7 --> 717.0600000000001
because I ate 45 minutes ago and this

714.21 --> 719.9100000000001
pretty heavy lunch like I do my lunch is

717.06 --> 722.9399999999999
early now and this is all [ __ ] but

719.91 --> 725.43
yeah it does cause that I have to be

722.94 --> 727.5600000000001
careful about that my timings don't eat

725.43 --> 733.68
right before the show I just tires me

727.56 --> 733.9499999999999
out oh you finished Firefly so how was

733.68 --> 740.8199999999999
it

733.95 --> 743.1800000000001
Robin Stanley did you also watch the

740.82 --> 743.1800000000001
movie

762.49 --> 765.649
[Music]

768.13 --> 775.0
that fence can burn out power slip

771.67 --> 782.17
supply the what what are you talking

775.0 --> 784.95
about yard Sanford all right okay right

782.17 --> 788.29
robots soundly I'll enjoy it

784.95 --> 790.87
maybe I could probably recommend you

788.29 --> 792.79
taking like a little break between the

790.87 --> 796.63
series and the movie to really like just

792.79 --> 800.49
let it sink in for a while because

796.63 --> 800.49
things get pretty rigorous in the movie

801.54 --> 806.01
but it is a really good movie though

811.17 --> 820.049
yeah you're welcome I always like to

816.6 --> 824.269
spread around things that I think are

820.049 --> 824.269
really good because I do remember those

828.439 --> 833.2199999999999
No anakata

831.389 --> 840.179
come on you can't be serious about that

833.22 --> 844.619
I seen the Dark Crystal yeah of course I

840.179 --> 848.869
have it on blu-ray as well and I've seen

844.619 --> 848.869
part of the series but not all of it and

849.199 --> 855.059
distracted but my dad continued watching

853.139 --> 858.379
it actually he's been watching and he

855.059 --> 858.379
says it's a really good series

878.81 --> 884.79
yeah yeah Robert Stanley I know right

881.61 --> 888.23
the character development is just it's

884.79 --> 888.23
the best thing about the series

900.4 --> 903.59
[Music]

908.18 --> 913.0
see series leftovers never heard of that

915.04 --> 925.12
all right anyway right

940.19 --> 948.5600000000001
yeah flat earth land it seems to be just

944.6 --> 950.4200000000001
going steady and smooth so far and there

948.56 --> 956.8699999999999
isn't really a lot of development there

950.42 --> 960.139
seems to be more like more detailed NASA

956.87 --> 962.029
created stories coming out so I shared

960.139 --> 963.529
this I don't know put it on the after

962.029 --> 965.769
show or was it on the live show I don't

963.529 --> 973.3
remember maybe it was on the after show

965.769 --> 977.66
yesterday about like this new story the

973.3 --> 980.18
suppose it calculated history of the

977.66 --> 982.879
moon and all that that it supposedly had

980.18 --> 986.959
a sea of magma as well it's the giant

982.879 --> 989.24
piece of science fiction they had like

986.959 --> 991.31
this whole model of how the interior of

989.24 --> 994.4300000000001
the moon is and all that it was like wow

991.31 --> 996.29
okay so they they haven't really proven

994.43 --> 997.959
the molten iron core yet but they're

996.29 --> 1001.24
already well on their way of

997.959 --> 1003.189
establishing a new storyline with the

1001.24 --> 1006.36
moon concerning that and they brought in

1003.189 --> 1006.36
a Thea and all that

1015.23 --> 1018.07
mm-hmm

1018.34 --> 1024.5
okay average a I've seen The Witcher

1021.77 --> 1029.54
serie like I've seen it in there it's

1024.5 --> 1033.29
just that I really don't like it like

1029.54 --> 1036.01
the games already like I really didn't

1033.29 --> 1038.81
like them like really didn't like them

1036.01 --> 1040.6299999999999
not just because of books opposed to the

1038.81 --> 1043.339
character but the whole thing I just

1040.63 --> 1047.3290000000002
nothing about it I like it like I the

1043.339 --> 1049.52
more that game continued on and

1047.329 --> 1052.31
developed the less I started liking it

1049.52 --> 1054.2
and I've even tried some of it and that

1052.31 --> 1055.75
lasted for like 15 minutes and then I

1054.2 --> 1061.07
removed the game from my computer

1055.75 --> 1063.68
because I think it sucks and I and I

1061.07 --> 1073.6899999999998
don't like the feel of it so no not my

1063.68 --> 1073.69
thing but yeah that's me

1086.789 --> 1092.1589999999999
yeah and I've seen like part of the

1089.699 --> 1096.269
series and yeah it may be very high-tech

1092.159 --> 1100.249
and all that I just don't like it I just

1096.269 --> 1100.249
don't like it sorry

1116.0 --> 1121.43
and there's other game legends out there

1119.75 --> 1124.22
I don't even remember their name right

1121.43 --> 1127.25
now because yeah that's part of it but

1124.22 --> 1130.51
there's more of these concept figures

1127.25 --> 1133.49
from games that I just really don't like

1130.51 --> 1136.28
it's getting more rare that I like game

1133.49 --> 1140.6
characters at all because they're all

1136.28 --> 1144.6499999999999
just getting so artificial and forced

1140.6 --> 1146.83
and [ __ ] and just I don't like what

1144.65 --> 1146.8300000000002
they're doing

1157.98 --> 1166.71
then again I don't really keep track of

1161.58 --> 1170.07
it all well basically because of that

1166.71 --> 1172.2
because it just every time new game I

1170.07 --> 1175.26
looked at it review or something and

1172.2 --> 1176.88
it's just like oh yeah they're

1175.26 --> 1178.3799999999999
mentioning of the reviewers are

1176.88 --> 1180.99
mentioning all these things that are so

1178.38 --> 1185.73
cool about it and I'm just like wow I

1180.99 --> 1189.83
really don't care and yeah I don't know

1185.73 --> 1189.83
I I'm not the game where I used to be

1209.15 --> 1217.51
right here glitch huh

1219.5 --> 1229.22
never heard of that that sounds

1221.96 --> 1241.25
interesting is that on Netflix to check

1229.22 --> 1244.51
it out all right three seasons so dear

1241.25 --> 1244.51
or our great

1259.5 --> 1262.34
okay

1262.799 --> 1269.1299999999999
looks freaky maybe I'll check it out

1267.63 --> 1271.19
when I'm in the mood for that kind of

1269.13 --> 1271.19
[ __ ]

1279.7 --> 1284.49
no God there's also the cartoon series

1287.22 --> 1301.8700000000001
anyway right well Roger I used to like

1299.5 --> 1304.63
horror but I that's because I used to

1301.87 --> 1307.7099999999998
feel [ __ ] doomed and then if it has

1304.63 --> 1310.96
an interesting extra aspect about it I

1307.71 --> 1313.06
am doing whatever I can to get out of

1310.96 --> 1316.69
that and it's really tough sometimes

1313.06 --> 1319.3899999999999
still haunts me it's like literally

1316.69 --> 1322.63
things from my past are like crawling

1319.39 --> 1326.2800000000002
through my memory trying to touch me in

1322.63 --> 1329.5
the current time it's really [ __ ] up

1326.28 --> 1338.8
times feels like I literally in a battle

1329.5 --> 1340.75
with my spirit of my past so yeah I'm

1338.8 --> 1345.03
not real big fan of horror in general

1340.75 --> 1348.97
like even dark I had problems with it

1345.03 --> 1353.11
it's just that the way like it was

1348.97 --> 1356.71
really so much sci-fi about yeah this

1353.11 --> 1359.86
figure yeah structuring and all the

1356.71 --> 1361.75
trickery that comes with time travel in

1359.86 --> 1364.9299999999998
movies and that was what is interesting

1361.75 --> 1370.05
about it I didn't like the dark [ __ ] too

1364.93 --> 1370.05
much but they didn't overdo that

1373.66 --> 1382.93
huh anyway no more horror than stranger

1378.46 --> 1384.76
things right but yeah but stranger

1382.93 --> 1393.73
things is a whole different type of

1384.76 --> 1396.8799999999999
genre really that's yeah it's Stephen

1393.73 --> 1401.47
King style so it's like just kid stuff

1396.88 --> 1404.14
and then surreal horror but specifically

1401.47 --> 1407.83
surreal so it's not just bloody horror

1404.14 --> 1412.7700000000002
and like things have more meaning in

1407.83 --> 1415.9299999999998
that style and it's never

1412.77 --> 1419.95
action-oriented not really unless it is

1415.93 --> 1421.96
like ooh simple like dueling doubling

1419.95 --> 1423.55
with the teenagers thing that somebody

1421.96 --> 1426.82
has to overcome something or whatever

1423.55 --> 1431.47
and I don't know yeah it does get it as

1426.82 --> 1435.85
this stranger things develop there was

1431.47 --> 1439.3600000000001
more action but that was just I don't

1435.85 --> 1441.4299999999998
know that's how it developed it also

1439.36 --> 1443.74
just decayed in the superpower and all

1441.43 --> 1447.3100000000002
that but it's not to say it's not really

1443.74 --> 1449.83
hard so yeah I can sit through that but

1447.31 --> 1452.01
if it's like really just hard then it's

1449.83 --> 1455.74
gonna be dream it's gonna be like

1452.01 --> 1459.7
feeling less destruction and action

1455.74 --> 1461.74
usually two or just terror and paranoid

1459.7 --> 1466.38
all all the time too much I don't like

1461.74 --> 1466.38
that anymore I just done

1469.47 --> 1477.9
okay tiny one bull well it it did get

1473.29 --> 1481.18
classified by Netflix as are among other

1477.9 --> 1483.8200000000002
but yeah maybe that's just because of

1481.18 --> 1486.78
the yeah the in that situate or whatever

1483.82 --> 1489.1299999999999
that's supposed to turn out to be rising

1486.78 --> 1493.33
that's like the thing that popped up

1489.13 --> 1495.46
wasn't like an intro thingy so I don't

1493.33 --> 1500.98
know I'll check it out at some point

1495.46 --> 1512.26
we'll see you can trust me I'm a baller

1500.98 --> 1516.31
oh goody right so let's let's move on

1512.26 --> 1519.9
this this yeah talking about movies and

1516.31 --> 1523.56
series for the 600 episode is not really

1519.9 --> 1523.5600000000002
all that fantastic

1550.02 --> 1558.31
so any any other subject that I could

1554.5 --> 1560.47
touch upon that is not a subject that

1558.31 --> 1564.87
everyone constantly talks about at all

1560.47 --> 1564.8700000000001
time please what

1576.05 --> 1584.0
it's now maybe I'm just just kind of

1581.3 --> 1586.97
stuck right now concerning bigger

1584.0 --> 1589.04
picture things you know there's so many

1586.97 --> 1594.53
angles to feed things our beginnings

1589.04 --> 1600.01
getting so convoluted to me that yeah

1594.53 --> 1600.01
basically things are starting to overlap

1617.47 --> 1627.23
did that it's like big rare yesterday

1622.09 --> 1629.12
there was a really good analysis about

1627.23 --> 1639.08
the situation in the United States at

1629.12 --> 1641.6
least that yeah it is really like Trump

1639.08 --> 1644.09
and Hillary in a way are two faces of

1641.6 --> 1645.1899999999998
the same program with the same tactics

1644.09 --> 1649.37
[Music]

1645.19 --> 1653.42
targeting two opposing political groups

1649.37 --> 1656.9599999999998
as it were and they are really are like

1653.42 --> 1660.74
two faces of the same side now that's

1656.96 --> 1665.1200000000001
almost blatantly obvious but it's like

1660.74 --> 1666.92
what does that really mean and just

1665.12 --> 1676.2099999999998
start to wonder like who are these

1666.92 --> 1676.21
people really how did it get to that

1681.34 --> 1691.25
like how many people out there are even

1686.42 --> 1694.46
in control with oversight over these

1691.25 --> 1699.13
hyper complex social engineered thingies

1694.46 --> 1702.44
and tricks how many people can even

1699.13 --> 1704.72
maintain oversight over it all over the

1702.44 --> 1708.05
preponderance of the possibilities and

1704.72 --> 1710.8700000000001
all that and how to keep each other in

1708.05 --> 1717.11
line with the information concerning who

1710.87 --> 1721.9699999999998
has it it's like I'm losing

1717.11 --> 1724.9599999999998
I don't know inside that like I can't

1721.97 --> 1728.33
figure it out I'd like yeah I could

1724.96 --> 1730.73
rough roughly emulate that for example

1728.33 --> 1734.1799999999998
in a D&D game and just it would be like

1730.73 --> 1736.7
yeah it's a complex conspiracy but I

1734.18 --> 1739.52
would never be able to truly reflect an

1736.7 --> 1742.8700000000001
understanding upon it because I don't

1739.52 --> 1742.87
really get it anymore

1749.859 --> 1760.399
it's alright to me and more the more and

1757.909 --> 1761.96
more United States issues and the

1760.399 --> 1763.9699999999998
freshmen especially the federal

1761.96 --> 1769.659
government comes up it's just to me

1763.97 --> 1773.809
almost like like nobody is in control

1769.659 --> 1776.5990000000002
nobody there's not really any control

1773.809 --> 1781.039
it's like everybody sticks to what

1776.599 --> 1784.1589999999999
they're supposed to do and following

1781.039 --> 1786.349
some kind of program what I wonder if

1784.159 --> 1788.2990000000002
they even know where it's really coming

1786.349 --> 1790.879
from how that keeps on working the way

1788.299 --> 1801.139
it does and it just feels more and more

1790.879 --> 1804.4699999999998
like nobody's really in control so who

1801.139 --> 1809.6589999999999
rolls out these options and decision

1804.47 --> 1813.019
structures who who is actually giving

1809.659 --> 1815.8300000000002
the yeah the options that are basically

1813.019 --> 1815.83
orders I

1823.1 --> 1833.6589999999999
seyton yeah oh yeah sure of course

1828.11 --> 1833.6589999999999
great very convenient to think like that

1834.26 --> 1842.76
but I don't think so

1836.94 --> 1846.48
you know Satan's doing his work through

1842.76 --> 1850.4089999999999
them I'm sure you know especially

1846.48 --> 1854.279
basically giving up control to a bigger

1850.409 --> 1859.529
system yeah gifts Satan in the indirect

1854.279 --> 1863.97
grip but it's really it has to come from

1859.529 --> 1868.82
somewhere from someone you know I don't

1863.97 --> 1868.82
think Satan exists outside of humans

1869.179 --> 1876.0900000000001
like even if you would think that there

1873.48 --> 1879.8700000000001
would be some mighty artificial

1876.09 --> 1882.149
intelligence program that thing is not

1879.87 --> 1886.1
really conscious anyway no matter how

1882.149 --> 1891.389
brilliant and oversight it has it is

1886.1 --> 1894.4189999999999
crafted from the will and the spirit of

1891.389 --> 1897.539
those that have made it together and

1894.419 --> 1899.279
have designed it and designated it and

1897.539 --> 1904.889
all that it is the preponderance of

1899.279 --> 1908.88
pieces of their spirit and if there

1904.889 --> 1911.61
would be no people eventually to update

1908.88 --> 1914.3990000000001
it and to help it adapt it would no

1911.61 --> 1921.87
longer function so it is the people I'm

1914.399 --> 1925.59
convinced there is no evil without

1921.87 --> 1927.6299999999999
people not saying that that yeah you

1925.59 --> 1930.36
should draw some dramatic conclusions

1927.63 --> 1934.8300000000002
from that but I'm just wondering like

1930.36 --> 1937.07
what is keeping it all in place like

1934.83 --> 1937.07
this

1940.65 --> 1945.23
that doesn't mean anything good servant

1945.47 --> 1949.22
you're blabbering now

1955.23 --> 1958.97
Satan is a spirit

1963.85 --> 1975.58
just like Christ is a spirit the

1967.66 --> 1978.01
frequency Satan is to and yeah people

1975.58 --> 1982.56
like that typically gather up power

1978.01 --> 1986.55
because they are driven by control but

1982.56 --> 1992.46
that's not literally in yeah that's not

1986.55 --> 1995.47
the possession of Satan it's just that

1992.46 --> 1998.5
wherever he is

1995.47 --> 2005.42
there is always gathering of stuff

1998.5 --> 2009.8
happening so know this the grips so

2005.42 --> 2009.8000000000002
spirit the frequency

2018.39 --> 2023.22
is the moonlight still cold hello mr.

2021.12 --> 2027.9899999999998
gadget thank you for the $2 super jet

2023.22 --> 2034.289
donation still cold well it is presumed

2027.99 --> 2036.39
to be cold but yeah there are still some

2034.289 --> 2040.34
little details to work out in order to

2036.39 --> 2044.8090000000002
figure out what that phenomena really is

2040.34 --> 2048.839
so I haven't really done any empirical

2044.809 --> 2051.599
experiments with that yet but I do have

2048.839 --> 2062.49
like a structure for it to how to figure

2051.599 --> 2066.9500000000003
it out there is 106 it's called inertia

2062.49 --> 2066.95
what are you talking about

2080.26 --> 2093.7900000000004
oh hello Carlos I guess you have done an

2084.609 --> 2096.0099999999998
experiment that it's very cute huh Thank

2093.79 --> 2099.2799999999997
You Amelia for the six-dollar super

2096.01 --> 2101.8
jetta nation happy 600th they are Wynn

2099.28 --> 2110.9500000000003
and many more thank you very much for

2101.8 --> 2113.02
your continued support yeah guys this is

2110.95 --> 2118.0
very nice they're very cute but please

2113.02 --> 2120.7
spare me the exoteric babbling talk

2118.0 --> 2122.5
about Satan as a spirit and then talk

2120.7 --> 2126.97
about Jesus as a spirit I'm talking

2122.5 --> 2130.42
about esoterics esoterics this is not a

2126.97 --> 2136.1189999999997
historical reference here this is

2130.42 --> 2139.7400000000002
esoterics it's the spiritual structure

2136.119 --> 2144.52
and presuming the physical realm as a

2139.74 --> 2148.33
secondary effect that that's what I'm

2144.52 --> 2151.69
studying frequency frequency of

2148.33 --> 2155.38
principle will an energy in a certain

2151.69 --> 2157.57
way and the other way around the inverse

2155.38 --> 2159.369
for as you know of it and the

2157.57 --> 2162.6090000000004
consequence is how does it reflect upon

2159.369 --> 2168.07
people how does it reflect upon scenario

2162.609 --> 2172.33
changing I know that it's the light and

2168.07 --> 2174.28
the darkness you could call it as you

2172.33 --> 2179.8199999999997
can also call it yeah the the frequency

2174.28 --> 2179.82
of Jesus and the frequency of Satan

2186.58 --> 2190.39
oh by the way thank you all so Giulio

2188.77 --> 2196.02
Pavan for the $10 ship which had the

2190.39 --> 2196.02
nation hello thanks for popping by

2200.51 --> 2208.7000000000003
yeah well no drama llama an expert at

2206.75 --> 2213.92
how the world works that's kind of a

2208.7 --> 2219.2799999999997
broad term there I I do my best to

2213.92 --> 2224.14
figure it out from a very broad

2219.28 --> 2227.03
spiritually inclusive perspective and

2224.14 --> 2230.18
stepping away from unnecessarily

2227.03 --> 2236.0
unnecessary complexities which typically

2230.18 --> 2238.1189999999997
come with Exeter ISM and that's what I

2236.0 --> 2238.119
do

2245.19 --> 2251.9700000000003
I mean I know about God and creation

2249.0 --> 2258.329
it's Oh what does that make me an expert

2251.97 --> 2260.43
then no everybody can blab around all

2258.329 --> 2263.13
day long about God and creation and

2260.43 --> 2267.269
Bible referencing all day long to back

2263.13 --> 2271.1400000000003
that up whatever their claim is probably

2267.269 --> 2273.839
they're doing it well what I don't

2271.14 --> 2278.269
concern myself with those types of

2273.839 --> 2281.339
approaches I mean as a terrorist I don't

2278.269 --> 2283.799
dig too much in exit terrorism I am

2281.339 --> 2286.2
interested though I do try to keep tabs

2283.799 --> 2290.009
it's just not my focus it's not my

2286.2 --> 2293.5789999999997
approach I approach through much more

2290.009 --> 2297.7400000000002
intuitive and feeling related things and

2293.579 --> 2300.9300000000003
just from a very personal identity

2297.74 --> 2303.839
perspective and then reflecting that

2300.93 --> 2307.759
upon everything else like how does

2303.839 --> 2307.759
things affect people

2312.39 --> 2315.72
how does it affect me does it affect

2314.64 --> 2323.2999999999997
others the same way

2315.72 --> 2323.2999999999997
why anyway

2331.66 --> 2334.5299999999997
mm-hmm

2339.41 --> 2347.7599999999998
it seems to be getting colder to you is

2342.57 --> 2350.6400000000003
it it's tough to establish that you know

2347.76 --> 2356.1000000000004
when there's more moonlight or when the

2350.64 --> 2361.02
moon is the fullest yeah it there is an

2356.1 --> 2365.19
experience that is shared that it is

2361.02 --> 2368.73
more cold but yet first we have to

2365.19 --> 2373.53
really establish what the moon light

2368.73 --> 2377.42
this perceived cold really is what is

2373.53 --> 2380.6400000000003
that because cold is heat transfer you

2377.42 --> 2386.31
experience cold when heat is transferred

2380.64 --> 2390.6299999999997
through entropy from well where your

2386.31 --> 2393.99
heat sensory are in your skin away from

2390.63 --> 2396.36
it outside of your skin and that cooling

2393.99 --> 2399.47
off that is what you experience is cold

2396.36 --> 2403.4100000000003
so what exactly about the moonlight

2399.47 --> 2405.99
causes this phenomenon and that is what

2403.41 --> 2409.2
I want to study in order to yeah figure

2405.99 --> 2411.5099999999998
it out get get the misunderstandings out

2409.2 --> 2413.91
of the way once and for all because in

2411.51 --> 2416.0600000000004
our current understanding it would be

2413.91 --> 2420.33
technically impossible to have lights

2416.06 --> 2425.54
create cold energy that wouldn't make

2420.33 --> 2429.12
any sense cold energy is like a

2425.54 --> 2430.92
contradiction in terms already but there

2429.12 --> 2433.23
could be other effects happening and

2430.92 --> 2436.38
I've theorized about that how it could

2433.23 --> 2441.33
actually moonlight not contain cold

2436.38 --> 2444.42
energy or take and kahit energy away but

2441.33 --> 2446.85
that it might actually increase the

2444.42 --> 2450.81
entropy effect and heat transfer because

2446.85 --> 2453.93
if it would suddenly transfer more

2450.81 --> 2457.47
rapidly in a local position that would

2453.93 --> 2460.74
be perceived and measured as affective

2457.47 --> 2463.9199999999996
cold so I think that might that the

2460.74 --> 2465.99
light may not introduce cold energy but

2463.92 --> 2468.78
that it may simply have a unique

2465.99 --> 2470.54
property that it increases entropy and

2468.78 --> 2473.4500000000003
that makes

2470.54 --> 2477.02
out of other sense as well because it's

2473.45 --> 2480.1099999999997
also said that for example if you leave

2477.02 --> 2486.64
meat in the moonlight it will rot

2480.11 --> 2491.03
quicker and mushrooms grow better and I

2486.64 --> 2494.0299999999997
think so I'm not too sure and yeah with

2491.03 --> 2498.65
the sunlight it's the opposite it's you

2494.03 --> 2501.92
can even dry meat in the Sun and though

2498.65 --> 2504.01
it'll preserve it so yeah entropy I

2501.92 --> 2506.63
think entropy has more to do with it

2504.01 --> 2509.6200000000003
than we realize it's not as much about

2506.63 --> 2513.4700000000003
the light as it is about an entropic

2509.62 --> 2515.45
influencing effects at least concerning

2513.47 --> 2517.1299999999997
the moon but who knows once that is

2515.45 --> 2519.71
established then maybe there is

2517.13 --> 2522.34
something to that even with the Sun I've

2519.71 --> 2524.48
already stepped away from the standard

2522.34 --> 2526.1600000000003
presupposition that almost everyone in

2524.48 --> 2528.5
the world has its various tough to get

2526.16 --> 2530.21
away from that there are even physical

2528.5 --> 2534.55
objects emanating light in the first

2530.21 --> 2539.21
place they're more like manifestations

2534.55 --> 2544.25
well if there is like an intro to

2539.21 --> 2549.71
entropy influence created by electricity

2544.25 --> 2553.97
with light as side effects then suddenly

2549.71 --> 2558.56
the model starts to become more physical

2553.97 --> 2563.6899999999996
more tangible in figuring out what these

2558.56 --> 2566.21
celestial lights really are just get all

2563.69 --> 2569.56
the properties and get all the misc

2566.21 --> 2574.9700000000003
assumptions the mistakes out of the way

2569.56 --> 2577.09
and figure it out that's what I want to

2574.97 --> 2577.0899999999997
do

2585.57 --> 2595.1400000000003
Martin Tobruk no there is no absolute

2588.39 --> 2598.31
zero of physics well maybe yeah maybe

2595.14 --> 2601.68
emotional but for example in pressure

2598.31 --> 2608.94
pressure physics there is no zero it's

2601.68 --> 2615.69
impossible and I don't know about the

2608.94 --> 2618.12
physical limitations of the realm like

2615.69 --> 2621.17
how much force can it handle or pressure

2618.12 --> 2621.17
or whatever I don't know

2657.059 --> 2666.1690000000003
that's a zero yeah but net zero is not

2661.229 --> 2670.6789999999996
really zero it's a relative zero it's a

2666.169 --> 2673.0389999999998
zero from a perspective specific point

2670.679 --> 2673.039
of view

2677.93 --> 2681.0899999999997
[Music]

2686.03 --> 2692.8500000000004
well Jeff Jones shadows on the moon look

2690.6 --> 2695.88
yeah they can puzzle you all day long

2692.85 --> 2699.2599999999998
but I think part of the puzzle is that

2695.88 --> 2701.58
you are already in your minds

2699.26 --> 2704.01
determining that they are shadows to

2701.58 --> 2706.37
begin with and that it isn't some kind

2704.01 --> 2709.4100000000003
of strange likely that you're observing

2706.37 --> 2711.5099999999998
which I am convinced it is now that's of

2709.41 --> 2715.6499999999996
course kind of difficult to start to do

2711.51 --> 2719.1600000000003
that but it will certainly help you get

2715.65 --> 2729.81
out of the typical mindset that there's

2719.16 --> 2731.3999999999996
just these it's like the fourth time is

2729.81 --> 2733.88
flying in front of my camera that piece

2731.4 --> 2733.88
of [ __ ]

2762.11 --> 2766.4900000000002
shadows can be reflected no but you're

2764.81 --> 2767.7999999999997
assuming their shadows in the first

2766.49 --> 2774.37
place

2767.8 --> 2777.8900000000003
the shadow could simply mean a lack of

2774.37 --> 2781.8199999999997
light in that virtual spot as part of

2777.89 --> 2785.6299999999997
the hologram that it likely is as a side

2781.82 --> 2788.02
effect of the light manifests in your

2785.63 --> 2788.02
location

2788.14 --> 2801.2
it's the backdrop backdrop hologram

2793.27 --> 2804.65
signature of the moonlight and it nears

2801.2 --> 2808.1299999999997
that complicated fractal pattern that

2804.65 --> 2812.36
suggests some kind of object with holes

2808.13 --> 2819.02
in it and the shadow play yeah it is

2812.36 --> 2821.82
mind-boggling it is yeah makes it very

2819.02 --> 2827.53
difficult for people

2821.82 --> 2827.53
[Music]

2831.48 --> 2837.54
it was a great likelihood that even like

2834.18 --> 2840.48
thousands of years ago if it was exactly

2837.54 --> 2843.18
like this two heavenly lights that

2840.48 --> 2846.33
people even back then even though there

2843.18 --> 2851.5099999999998
probably weren't any stupid heliocentric

2846.33 --> 2851.5099999999998
teachings going around that people just

2856.55 --> 2862.619
that people by themselves would start to

2860.31 --> 2864.75
imagine that it is some kind of literal

2862.619 --> 2867.69
ball floating out there for some

2864.75 --> 2871.02
mysterious reason and that those people

2867.69 --> 2874.56
could be called lunatics because they

2871.02 --> 2876.6
had crazy ideas about that light that

2874.56 --> 2881.04
everybody at that time would simply

2876.6 --> 2885.54
reference to as the lesser light through

2881.04 --> 2889.369
the Bible or maybe from another book

2885.54 --> 2889.369
that describes it in a similar fashion

2891.32 --> 2899.4
because yeah the moon is just uncanny

2895.369 --> 2901.9500000000003
crazy the way it looks with the shadow

2899.4 --> 2908.21
plates yeah you can go nuts on that it's

2901.95 --> 2908.21
like a hologram and it's just there

2926.35 --> 2934.95
when you look at the Black Swan are the

2928.93 --> 2934.95
shadows on the horizon refracted

2938.98 --> 2947.95
yeah well the shadows are basically part

2944.589 --> 2950.099
of the site so when you look at an

2947.95 --> 2954.91
object way in the distance it has

2950.099 --> 2957.82
shadows as part of it like it is locally

2954.91 --> 2960.94
lit up it parts of it will cost shadows

2957.82 --> 2966.4300000000003
and other parts of it and that whole

2960.94 --> 2970.54
appearance will be slightly reflective

2966.43 --> 2973.8689999999997
refracted which means yeah blur it up at

2970.54 --> 2977.5
times and it might be displaced in

2973.869 --> 2981.81
relation to the horizon so yes

2977.5 --> 2981.81
shadows are just as much refracted

2982.3 --> 2985.55
[Music]

2992.62 --> 2998.5899999999997
right you could basically consider

2994.54 --> 3003.99
shadow an object that is just less lid

2998.59 --> 3006.08
up that you're seeing yes I have talked

3003.99 --> 3010.77
about the lunar waved I don't know it's

3006.08 --> 3013.83
what's there to say it happened multiple

3010.77 --> 3020.7
people have spotted it grow triple7 got

3013.83 --> 3022.65
quite famous for it and it's freaky cuz

3020.7 --> 3025.49
I learned about that in 2012 I don't

3022.65 --> 3025.4900000000002
know it made any sense

3045.29 --> 3052.52
but yeah the lunar wave was for me one

3048.47 --> 3055.73
of the earlier things that I could hold

3052.52 --> 3058.1
on to to suggest that the moon is not a

3055.73 --> 3060.02
physical object but just a light when

3058.1 --> 3065.27
everybody was still talking about

3060.02 --> 3070.07
oh it's plasma or it's a big rock or

3065.27 --> 3072.02
it's a moon base with the hollow thing

3070.07 --> 3076.61
there all this stuff about the moon

3072.02 --> 3079.46
remember that like 5 4 3 years ago up

3076.61 --> 3081.8
until then it's still at going on just

3079.46 --> 3082.9700000000003
say your weird ideas about the moon as a

3081.8 --> 3085.6400000000003
physical object

3082.97 --> 3092.5099999999998
well I or the UM just caught on like no

3085.64 --> 3094.6099999999997
I think it's a hologram and then

3092.51 --> 3098.9900000000002
eventually started like yeah and I think

3094.61 --> 3104.4500000000003
the Sun is a hologram too of course

3098.99 --> 3107.99
everybody's outraged but nowadays yeah I

3104.45 --> 3109.97
can basically say that among flat

3107.99 --> 3115.52
earthers and they respect that and they

3109.97 --> 3123.9399999999996
say yeah there's a good chance of it so

3115.52 --> 3126.23
yeah things do move slowly the insights

3123.94 --> 3127.94
then there's more to be attained and

3126.23 --> 3130.79
I've already been putting it out there

3127.94 --> 3132.9500000000003
and yeah I don't know maybe in two years

3130.79 --> 3136.0
or something maybe a year I don't know

3132.95 --> 3136.0
if how quickly will go

3161.59 --> 3164.6490000000003
[Music]

3165.03 --> 3172.3900000000003
all right a good look at Tom Parker I

3169.54 --> 3175.65
hope you'll catch a big one I don't know

3172.39 --> 3175.65
if you will

3191.71 --> 3198.13
but is there a lot of big fish there I

3194.65 --> 3199.839
don't know you know when we go out or we

3198.13 --> 3201.73
I've never even really fish but there

3199.839 --> 3204.849
are people fishing even just for the fun

3201.73 --> 3208.569
of it and there's very little fish and

3204.849 --> 3211.69
they're not very big to go to special

3208.569 --> 3216.569
palms and all that so yeah in the

3211.69 --> 3220.65
America there's a lot Wilder and bigger

3216.569 --> 3220.65
fish so I've heard

3221.19 --> 3224.67
so good luck with that

3245.46 --> 3252.21
what turns your neck what would what

3249.02 --> 3255.17
because it can be duplicate on a

3252.21 --> 3255.17
computer with one

3263.569 --> 3271.549
donar wave is a sulphide that makes no

3266.509 --> 3273.969
sense it's not being projected by your

3271.549 --> 3273.969
computer

3287.64 --> 3296.27
look it may simply be that in the whole

3291.75 --> 3302.79
effects that causes the celestial lights

3296.27 --> 3306.87
yeah there is things involved that have

3302.79 --> 3312.5099999999998
these ripples it as a as a natural

3306.87 --> 3317.72
consequence like electromagnetic cycle

3312.51 --> 3320.7000000000003
or something I don't know you know I

3317.72 --> 3324.0
can't fully explain how it works

3320.7 --> 3326.31
like the whole clock mechanism of the

3324.0 --> 3329.73
heavens and all that that and like how

3326.31 --> 3335.07
seasons shift that I can't really

3329.73 --> 3338.0
explain that it's predictable but in a

3335.07 --> 3341.6400000000003
mechanical way how light would manifest

3338.0 --> 3346.58
exactly like that from a non-local

3341.64 --> 3346.58
position dies way out of my league

3347.3 --> 3353.3
I'm just trying to establish like how is

3350.7 --> 3358.1299999999997
what is this light how is it manifesting

3353.3 --> 3365.28
without coming from a literal light

3358.13 --> 3367.4700000000003
object somewhere in the sky anyway I'm

3365.28 --> 3369.51
gonna run out the show so thanks

3367.47 --> 3373.08
everyone for coming I hope you like to

3369.51 --> 3376.26
show it was a bit slow a lot of TV

3373.08 --> 3379.67
talking series but yeah at the last

3376.26 --> 3382.61
moment at least that we did have more

3379.67 --> 3385.86
mechanical discussion so that's good

3382.61 --> 3389.31
usually does end up like this the show

3385.86 --> 3390.9900000000002
anyway if you like to show them please

3389.31 --> 3392.5499999999997
don't forget there opens it up and if

3390.99 --> 3394.2599999999998

3411.81 --> 3416.13
Saturday edition with letters the early

3413.55 --> 3419.28
bird number 601 and them that it's a

3416.13 --> 3420.6
Saturday it's Friday why do I keep

3419.28 --> 3422.1600000000003
thinking it's not

3420.6 --> 3423.9
Friday this is weird this has been

3422.16 --> 3425.79
happening to me all morning just like

3423.9 --> 3431.9700000000003
all its weekend's no it's not

3425.79 --> 3434.37
it's freaking Thursday what anyway I'll

3431.97 --> 3437.43
be back tomorrow flat earther leeward

3434.37 --> 3438.96
601 on Friday and I'm gonna join the

3437.43 --> 3442.5299999999997
Flat Earth debates right after this it's

3438.96 --> 3446.67
already started up so hashtag me fine

3442.53 --> 3449.6400000000003
indeed Oh Steve Tom Parker over Mukul my

3446.67 --> 3453.48

3449.64 --> 3454.23
lot of Memphis and yeah until the next

3453.48 --> 3457.25
