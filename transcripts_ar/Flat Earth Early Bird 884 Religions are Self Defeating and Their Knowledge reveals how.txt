stormy it's not as clouded

84.799 --> 88.24000000000001
right now but it has been like raining a

87.759 --> 91.68
lot

88.24 --> 93.03999999999999
in between this morning like really hard

91.68 --> 96.159
even

93.04 --> 101.84
but then it yeah it dried up again

96.159 --> 101.84
i was able to get groceries quick

103.2 --> 109.92
it's interesting just lots of birds are

106.56 --> 109.92
riding the wind out there

111.68 --> 115.28
up there don't know if the camera can

114.399 --> 118.159
pick him up

115.28 --> 118.159
at this distance

126.0 --> 132.239
but yeah heavy wind gusts so they keep

128.72 --> 132.239
on blowing all over the place

133.12 --> 138.959
but yeah despite that it's still kind of

135.04 --> 138.959
nice and warm with with the sun out

140.84 --> 145.28
sometimes

142.239 --> 146.239
behind it big cloud there again so maybe

145.28 --> 150.08
it's gonna go

146.239 --> 152.64000000000001
rain in just a few minutes

150.08 --> 152.64000000000001
i don't know

154.879 --> 161.64
so it's

158.239 --> 164.64000000000001
wednesday the 5th of may

161.64 --> 164.64
2021

166.239 --> 174.56
i'm decently rested today did

170.4 --> 174.56
go to bed quite early

184.64 --> 186.879
so

193.36 --> 202.4
yeah yesterday's flat earth debate

199.2 --> 206.07999999999998
was a bit of rumpus i think and

202.4 --> 207.04
sam on there again did not really

206.08 --> 210.959
participate

207.04 --> 213.519
in most of it live nathan was just

210.959 --> 216.08
going at it again chewing down on the

213.519 --> 216.08
globers

217.84 --> 225.20000000000002
and yeah nice after hang out as well

222.799 --> 226.239
uh yeah there's been a lot of live

225.2 --> 228.39999999999998
streams

226.239 --> 231.04
but i think i missed most of them for

228.4 --> 234.239
some reason i kept hanging around

231.04 --> 234.72
watching infowars and playing another

234.239 --> 240.239
game

234.72 --> 242.56
at the same time

240.239 --> 245.28
civilization five i i've played that

242.56 --> 245.28
game a lot

246.4 --> 254.159
it's just a single player game uh

250.72 --> 256.72
yeah i missed paula's

254.159 --> 258.32
live stream level up as she's called

256.72 --> 261.199
these days

258.32 --> 261.59999999999997
it was a brandon's life as well missed

261.199 --> 265.04
that

261.6 --> 268.24
martin litka i watched that back before

265.04 --> 271.52000000000004
this show pretty much most of it was

268.24 --> 275.12
very interesting like

271.52 --> 278.15999999999997
michelangelo floating cities and

275.12 --> 282.32
like the juggernaut

278.16 --> 285.68
and their great pictures

282.32 --> 288.0
it was really interesting especially

285.68 --> 290.96
like the concept of floating cities that

288.0 --> 292.639
cities would basically arrive yeah or

290.96 --> 295.44
big buildings

292.639 --> 296.16
could be transported per ship and then

295.44 --> 299.759
installed

296.16 --> 299.759
very fascinating concept

301.52 --> 305.84
and yeah could that be like post flood

304.96 --> 308.15999999999997
technology

305.84 --> 310.56
or something i don't know it was just

308.16 --> 313.36
very tintellating

310.56 --> 315.759
hello amanda young first in chat good

313.36 --> 315.759
morning

322.84 --> 325.84
uh

326.479 --> 330.56
but yeah i missed out on most other live

328.4 --> 335.35999999999996
streams it was just

330.56 --> 339.84
stuck watching infowars

335.36 --> 339.84000000000003
do their thing typically

347.36 --> 354.24
and also i noticed that like it's just

350.56 --> 354.24
really i'm noticing that

357.919 --> 360.96
it's just kind of weird to feel now that

360.56 --> 364.479
like

360.96 --> 368.56
concerning corona situation i called

364.479 --> 372.71999999999997
out so much and everybody was being all

368.56 --> 376.88
careful at the beginning

372.72 --> 380.16
like being very careful and

376.88 --> 383.44
me too in a sort of way but pretty much

380.16 --> 386.16
i also just i

383.44 --> 387.759
i split up the approach so basically one

386.16 --> 390.16
hand presupposing okay

387.759 --> 392.039
maybe some of this is real what would it

390.16 --> 394.319
be like what are the flaws within the

392.039 --> 396.24
presuppositions right of the virus

394.319 --> 397.28000000000003
theory and all that and just like my

396.24 --> 400.319
masculine work

397.28 --> 404.71999999999997
but that's been become quite

400.319 --> 404.72
mainstream and at the same time

404.8 --> 411.039
my other branch just saying like no

408.08 --> 413.52
it's very likely to all be false here is

411.039 --> 415.759
the alternative

413.52 --> 417.12
idea of what viruses are drawing in

415.759 --> 420.16
germany medicine

417.12 --> 420.16
terrain theory

420.479 --> 423.52
and just an entirely different outlook

422.88 --> 426.8
on that

423.52 --> 427.28
and yeah it's it's interesting to see

426.8 --> 429.28000000000003
how

427.28 --> 430.479
things are developing out there there's

429.28 --> 434.0
so many doctors

430.479 --> 436.479
constantly coming out and just

434.0 --> 437.759
calling out the the other corona

436.479 --> 440.24
measures and all that

437.759 --> 443.91900000000004
and all these details for what they are

440.24 --> 443.919
just complete fabrications

444.96 --> 454.15999999999997
i think probably this whole ordeal

450.0 --> 458.72
will have woken up a lot of people about

454.16 --> 460.88000000000005
just faking potentially fake nature of

458.72 --> 463.03900000000004
viruses but at least with this one it's

460.88 --> 466.08
just so telling that

463.039 --> 468.56
like there isn't really anything

466.08 --> 469.599
for such a hype there is really nothing

468.56 --> 474.479
anyway

469.599 --> 474.479
hey nathan oakley 1980 seeking star

476.84 --> 481.52
water

479.28 --> 484.96
hi you're sounds like you're in an

481.52 --> 484.96
interesting place the wilds

485.36 --> 493.84000000000003
find video ad for tom clancy okay

488.96 --> 493.84
lg phone and

494.96 --> 501.84
i get quality mainstream ads

498.319 --> 505.52000000000004
well you had like the uh

501.84 --> 507.67999999999995
the master class of what it is like to

505.52 --> 510.56
be an astronaut kind of

507.68 --> 510.56
video so

511.199 --> 515.279
i don't know do i get quality at

515.839 --> 520.32
i think ads are still kind of specific

518.399 --> 522.8
to the type of people that are going to

520.32 --> 522.8000000000001
tune in

523.839 --> 527.44
like i get a lot of kind of annoying ads

526.72 --> 531.0400000000001
of like oh

527.44 --> 535.6
how to start your basic business or

531.04 --> 537.76
how to do this how just things

535.6 --> 538.9590000000001
telling me like yeah you're not doing

537.76 --> 541.8389999999999
anything

538.959 --> 546.3199999999999
you're not doing enough why aren't you

541.839 --> 551.519
more entangled into doing everything

546.32 --> 551.519
i get nasa you get good ads okay

554.08 --> 557.6
well nathan also something that stood

556.64 --> 562.8
out to me is that

557.6 --> 565.36
you don't get this crazy downvote pylon

562.8 --> 566.88
you're you're have a lot more upvotes

565.36 --> 569.44
compared to

566.88 --> 572.8
downvotes on average with all of your

569.44 --> 572.8000000000001
street all of your streams

574.0 --> 578.32
i always wondered like why why is that

578.88 --> 582.48
what has made people that do the

581.839 --> 585.2790000000001
downfall

582.48 --> 586.5600000000001
piling or the algorithm that allows

585.279 --> 591.12
certain things to happen

586.56 --> 594.16
why why you

591.12 --> 596.399
you get depression era cooking videos

594.16 --> 596.399
what

603.04 --> 610.16
you get women diet programs

606.079 --> 610.16
and brass i don't what is brass

611.279 --> 617.4399999999999
the trolls have given up on you

614.64 --> 620.24
maybe nathan maybe you've you're just

617.44 --> 620.24
too punishing

620.56 --> 623.5189999999999
too relentless

625.12 --> 630.9590000000001
but i don't know i don't know why

628.88 --> 632.0
why it's arranged that way but it's all

630.959 --> 633.8389999999999
fine with me you know

632.0 --> 635.2
the trolls want to play a game with my

633.839 --> 638.24
channel

635.2 --> 641.44
think that they can influence me somehow

638.24 --> 647.279
well in a way they are lingerie okay

641.44 --> 649.7600000000001
seeking star wars

647.279 --> 649.76
the hell

654.959 --> 661.8389999999999
trying to encourage you to go dating or

658.839 --> 661.839
something

662.24 --> 668.16
it's weird it is kind of

666.32 --> 669.7600000000001
it can be kind of interesting to

668.16 --> 671.4399999999999
basically check out with every

669.76 --> 674.079
individual

671.44 --> 676.0790000000001
what kind of ads are you getting with

674.079 --> 678.8
what show

676.079 --> 681.4399999999999
and then figure out what made them

678.8 --> 682.88
decide for you that these ads would be

681.44 --> 685.7600000000001
appropriate

682.88 --> 686.8
it's almost like what opinions do the

685.76 --> 689.04
algorithms

686.8 --> 690.399
the organizers whoever actually is

689.04 --> 693.04
directing that have

690.399 --> 695.68
for the individual with what show what's

693.04 --> 695.68
the message

697.04 --> 701.36
because the ads play games

701.68 --> 710.4799999999999
they really do it's like they're playing

705.12 --> 710.48
chess advertisement chess sometimes i

714.839 --> 717.839
think

722.639 --> 726.16
the downvotes from multiple accounts

724.48 --> 726.9590000000001
under one email just get removed by

726.16 --> 729.6
youtube

726.959 --> 731.4399999999999
or maybe nathan but i really do get a

729.6 --> 731.839
lot of down votes but it could be that

731.44 --> 736.1600000000001
there's

731.839 --> 736.1600000000001
just this whole list

736.48 --> 741.279
where basically there is some requests

738.48 --> 744.24
like okay everybody please

741.279 --> 745.2
keep down voting it this is important

744.24 --> 747.36
something like that

745.2 --> 748.48
it could be seriously like an organized

747.36 --> 752.0
conspiracy

748.48 --> 754.48
which would be very silly by the way to

752.0 --> 754.48
do that

754.88 --> 758.8
because with me most of my down votes

757.519 --> 762.079
stay

758.8 --> 765.279
so like if i get to like minus 40

762.079 --> 765.279
it'll just stay there

767.6 --> 770.639
let's see let me check out some videos

770.079 --> 773.8389999999999
to

770.639 --> 773.839
compare it

779.82 --> 783.029
[Music]

784.839 --> 789.36
right

786.16 --> 792.639
let's look at show eight eight one yeah

789.36 --> 792.639
i got minus twenty eight

793.92 --> 803.76
eight eight two minus thirty eight

801.44 --> 805.2
celestial lights are not stars in jars

803.76 --> 810.8
that one

805.2 --> 810.8000000000001
and from yesterday minus 40. see so

810.959 --> 817.1999999999999
i don't know about these socks

814.0 --> 820.079
that get deleted i seem to just have

817.2 --> 820.0790000000001
consistently

820.24 --> 825.6
quantities of down votes

823.6 --> 829.839
you just thumbs up the video thanks

825.6 --> 829.839
nathan i do appreciate that

830.72 --> 837.6
except if you pay attention pay

834.24 --> 840.8
i'm going to ask not to use ad blocker

837.6 --> 845.519
well do uh seeking star wars

840.8 --> 847.4399999999999
if you really hate the ads

845.519 --> 848.72
i'm yeah i'm not going to stop you from

847.44 --> 853.2790000000001
using ad blocker

848.72 --> 856.32
it's just that by doing that you also

853.279 --> 860.48
cancel on the revenue that

856.32 --> 861.9200000000001
that i would get so it's not good for my

860.48 --> 865.12
stats but hey if

861.92 --> 867.92
if you insist on ad blockers then

865.12 --> 869.6
yeah i'm not going to stop you i get it

867.92 --> 870.959
it's just that i've kind of i kind of

869.6 --> 873.839
refrain from it also

870.959 --> 875.199
i find it interesting to just see like

873.839 --> 878.0
what do the ads do

875.199 --> 880.56
because there there's a there's a system

878.0 --> 880.56
behind it

882.839 --> 889.12
anyway thanks

885.12 --> 889.12
the ghost of riley's dog what

890.959 --> 902.88
which ghost

899.839 --> 902.8800000000001
hello pad fee

907.279 --> 913.8389999999999
particular soft tour you mean tor

910.839 --> 913.839
browser

914.88 --> 920.0
or is it something else anyway uh

921.12 --> 927.839
dean wright's uh try to catch up

938.0 --> 944.0
good ads low bad low revenue ads

941.839 --> 946.8000000000001
i nate i don't know which ones are

944.0 --> 949.92
what's the difference how do you

946.8 --> 953.12
figure out good ads

949.92 --> 956.639
versus the bad ads

953.12 --> 956.639
i mean take it that

957.279 --> 962.16
bad ads would be of things that are like

960.959 --> 965.279
very

962.16 --> 966.959
very niche or something right

965.279 --> 968.56
i don't know it's kind of hard to

966.959 --> 983.8389999999999
determine

968.56 --> 983.8389999999999
for me

984.0 --> 987.92
okay kind of like the idea of staying

986.0 --> 989.36
anonymous while being online

987.92 --> 992.3199999999999
well yeah it all depends on your

989.36 --> 995.44
behavior you know but anonymity can be

992.32 --> 997.44
a devilish trap too because you might

995.44 --> 999.6800000000001
get seduced to display all kinds of

997.44 --> 1000.399
behavior and then just think ah nobody

999.68 --> 1003.5999999999999
knows it

1000.399 --> 1009.199
it's me except god

1003.6 --> 1012.48
right that's why i

1009.199 --> 1014.3199999999999
i like to not be anonymous i like to

1012.48 --> 1017.36
actually carry all the weight

1014.32 --> 1017.36
of everything i've done

1017.6 --> 1025.839
when i go around

1029.439 --> 1033.52
you just thumb down this video

1036.839 --> 1043.52
okay

1038.48 --> 1047.679
why ghost of riley's dog

1043.52 --> 1047.679
can you can you tell me why you do that

1049.76 --> 1053.84
do you know why you do that

1078.84 --> 1084.3999999999999
so

1080.32 --> 1084.3999999999999
all right anyway i got green tea here

1084.96 --> 1092.16
i'm really kind of hungry at this moment

1088.799 --> 1093.2
it's very typical like i'm a little

1092.16 --> 1094.88
nervous and

1093.2 --> 1096.32
just working towards okay i'm gonna

1094.88 --> 1098.96
start the show

1096.32 --> 1102.0
then right when i'm gonna start the show

1098.96 --> 1109.44
i get really hungry it's so typical

1102.0 --> 1112.88
but yeah get over it

1109.44 --> 1116.4
man but anyway i'm glad

1112.88 --> 1118.3200000000002
i watched martin's show from yesterday

1116.4 --> 1120.24
because it really kind of changed around

1118.32 --> 1123.84
my energy

1120.24 --> 1123.84
it was it was really interesting

1126.08 --> 1129.9189999999999
and he for some reason felt really hyped

1129.28 --> 1133.12
up too

1129.919 --> 1134.96
like he felt as he said it like gonna

1133.12 --> 1138.6399999999999
have to

1134.96 --> 1141.679
get dressed drastic

1138.64 --> 1144.4
like he feels like he's stuck

1141.679 --> 1145.2800000000002
on the level he of what he's doing and

1144.4 --> 1147.919
wants to

1145.28 --> 1150.48
dig in deeper well i thought that the

1147.919 --> 1152.48
hangout and what he presented it was

1150.48 --> 1155.84
pretty

1152.48 --> 1158.559
it was pretty good it was fascinating

1155.84 --> 1159.28
gave me some material to think about the

1158.559 --> 1163.52
puzzle with

1159.28 --> 1167.2
like the concept of the the floating

1163.52 --> 1171.2
cities or basically entire buildings

1167.2 --> 1174.24
being transported by ship

1171.2 --> 1177.2
all those paintings and pictures it was

1174.24 --> 1179.039
really fascinating

1177.2 --> 1192.24
hey good servant good to see you how are

1179.039 --> 1194.08
you doing

1192.24 --> 1195.6
oh by the way i have to thank the my

1194.08 --> 1198.8799999999999
patreon supporters i

1195.6 --> 1201.36
got i got in

1198.88 --> 1202.96
the patreon support thank you very much

1201.36 --> 1207.84
everybody that supports

1202.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
me through that and that's

1210.96 --> 1214.559
seek no wait uh

1218.88 --> 1222.64
right samson gaining wisdom and brand

1221.76 --> 1224.32
brandom

1222.64 --> 1227.2
thank you very much for the continuing

1224.32 --> 1227.2
support over there

1228.4 --> 1234.4
it's very welcome i do need it a lot

1231.6 --> 1237.52
there's like a lot of weird

1234.4 --> 1240.0
money stuff bills happening

1237.52 --> 1240.0
right now

1240.88 --> 1244.88
so i can really use extra support

1243.2 --> 1248.32
because i'm pretty sure i'm like

1244.88 --> 1250.88
gonna really run out

1248.32 --> 1250.8799999999999
quickly

1253.52 --> 1257.36
but yeah this is basically this should

1255.6 --> 1259.84
be roughly the last month

1257.36 --> 1260.7199999999998
that i'm gonna have issues and then i'm

1259.84 --> 1264.1589999999999
finally gonna get

1260.72 --> 1265.84
the vacation pay i don't know why they

1264.159 --> 1268.159
have to do it like that

1265.84 --> 1269.12
and then i can finally get rid of like

1268.159 --> 1274.159
all the bills

1269.12 --> 1276.559
that are like lingering and move on

1274.159 --> 1277.6000000000001
probably not gonna be able to buy

1276.559 --> 1279.9189999999999
anything

1277.6 --> 1291.28
just paying off bills and that's gonna

1279.919 --> 1295.2
have to do

1291.28 --> 1295.2
hello superior general

1298.4 --> 1302.0800000000002
good to hear you're doing great good

1302.84 --> 1305.84
servant

1306.72 --> 1309.76
i hope your stomach is also doing much

1308.72 --> 1314.32
better

1309.76 --> 1314.32
you were mostly in recovery for that i

1316.84 --> 1319.84
heard

1344.84 --> 1347.84
right

1354.0 --> 1358.24
yeah martin litka did make me think

1356.159 --> 1359.44
again because i've pondered it on it

1358.24 --> 1362.799
before like

1359.44 --> 1363.44
how do some of these amazing pieces of

1362.799 --> 1367.44
art get

1363.44 --> 1371.44
made how does that work and

1367.44 --> 1371.44
i wonder sometimes too that if

1372.559 --> 1379.44
like there's bluffs with it happening

1376.159 --> 1382.48
like i think that way back art

1379.44 --> 1383.919
was also sometimes being used to kind of

1382.48 --> 1388.4
like

1383.919 --> 1393.679
suggest divine things by making it seem

1388.4 --> 1393.679
impossible so like with the what is it

1394.08 --> 1401.6789999999999
that massive inner dome painting

1398.0 --> 1403.52
from michelangelo like yeah how did they

1401.679 --> 1404.799
actually make that at the time how did

1403.52 --> 1407.84
they do that

1404.799 --> 1411.44
and it was supposedly done very quickly

1407.84 --> 1413.84
how does that work right it's really

1411.44 --> 1416.799
imagination defying like how how did

1413.84 --> 1421.039
they get that all right

1416.799 --> 1421.039
it's the view some very efficient

1421.44 --> 1423.919
system

1424.559 --> 1431.76
like maybe he micro modeled

1427.84 --> 1435.76
the whole thing then rough painted in it

1431.76 --> 1438.799
and then yeah maybe it was

1435.76 --> 1442.32
like more like placed painted

1438.799 --> 1446.0
fragments then pasted

1442.32 --> 1448.24
on the inside so instead of just

1446.0 --> 1449.2
literally drawing it on the spot on the

1448.24 --> 1452.64
building

1449.2 --> 1456.799
maybe there there were just pieces

1452.64 --> 1460.3200000000002
pre-painted based on the micro model

1456.799 --> 1463.36
and then just installed pretty quickly

1460.32 --> 1464.3999999999999
right that would bypass a whole lot of

1463.36 --> 1466.4799999999998
hassle

1464.4 --> 1470.0800000000002
that is something that i could imagine

1466.48 --> 1470.08
how they could have done something like

1470.84 --> 1475.4399999999998
that

1472.159 --> 1477.5200000000002
but other than that yeah how

1475.44 --> 1480.559
how does somebody make something like

1477.52 --> 1483.76
that on that quality

1480.559 --> 1484.559
sometimes you do wonder like is there

1483.76 --> 1488.96
some

1484.559 --> 1488.96
bizarre magic going on

1491.2 --> 1496.72
but i don't know my idea of how it could

1494.559 --> 1496.72
be

1496.76 --> 1505.2
pre-constructed and assembled

1500.559 --> 1505.2
like a sculpture almost

1505.679 --> 1508.4
what do you think

1511.76 --> 1517.039
right at some of the sculptor well look

1514.72 --> 1518.559
seeking start the sculptures the actual

1517.039 --> 1520.799
sculptures

1518.559 --> 1521.6
right i was talking about the the whole

1520.799 --> 1523.679
inner dome

1521.6 --> 1525.6789999999999
painting that wasn't a sculpture right

1523.679 --> 1529.2
but they could just make

1525.679 --> 1532.799
plaques pre-paint them

1529.2 --> 1535.8400000000001
and then install them piece by piece

1532.799 --> 1538.32
that would have been a lot quicker to do

1535.84 --> 1540.08
and it wouldn't be it would not be as

1538.32 --> 1543.6789999999999
disastrous like if you get

1540.08 --> 1546.08
a a panel of of that

1543.679 --> 1550.0800000000002
arrangement wrong you just make a new

1546.08 --> 1550.08
one and then paint it until it's right

1551.2 --> 1555.2
and then eventually after it's installed

1553.76 --> 1558.32
like

1555.2 --> 1559.279
make it completely seamless but i don't

1558.32 --> 1563.6789999999999
know it's an

1559.279 --> 1563.679
idea i might be completely wrong

1567.12 --> 1572.9599999999998
uh as for the yeah the real statues

1570.559 --> 1573.76
those incredible marble statues i think

1572.96 --> 1576.32
that

1573.76 --> 1579.039
i like the idea that that's all just

1576.32 --> 1585.6789999999999
carved from one piece

1579.039 --> 1588.72
i don't know about that

1585.679 --> 1592.72
i think they probably have also used

1588.72 --> 1597.84
stone molding technology like they would

1592.72 --> 1600.96
make a rough pre-sculpt and then

1597.84 --> 1605.52
find the details use the actual

1600.96 --> 1606.64
stone cutting after you've had a rough

1605.52 --> 1610.48
pre-model

1606.64 --> 1613.679
right yeah just like

1610.48 --> 1617.039
you can make limestone from

1613.679 --> 1618.64
clay and it'll be just stone well i

1617.039 --> 1621.2
think that they probably did something

1618.64 --> 1624.24
like that with a lot of marble statues

1621.2 --> 1641.8400000000001
so they pretty much clayed it

1624.24 --> 1641.84
hardened it up and then smooth it

1650.24 --> 1655.84
guess so is the medium in those wall

1653.039 --> 1655.84
panels

1659.6 --> 1664.32
i don't know what that is actually

1661.279 --> 1669.84
seeking star war what

1664.32 --> 1669.84
is that a form of plaster

1688.0 --> 1691.2
right well it was just a guess on my

1690.24 --> 1694.84
part

1691.2 --> 1697.3600000000001
like that would be a way to do it pretty

1694.84 --> 1700.1589999999999
quickly i don't know if

1697.36 --> 1701.52
it might be impossible with like how

1700.159 --> 1703.7600000000002
it's actually built

1701.52 --> 1706.8799999999999
that it might be proven that they

1703.76 --> 1711.84
actually would have had to paint it

1706.88 --> 1711.8400000000001
on there i don't know for sure

1722.55 --> 1725.809
[Music]

1728.28 --> 1732.43
[Music]

1736.96 --> 1742.3990000000001
anyway it was interesting to watch that

1747.52 --> 1752.0
so was there anything noteworthy that i

1750.88 --> 1754.88
missed because

1752.0 --> 1757.36
again i didn't watch any youtube

1754.88 --> 1757.3600000000001
yesterday

1764.84 --> 1767.84
evening

1781.12 --> 1784.8799999999999
hello rob h good to see you

1789.52 --> 1793.44
they met amazing technologies are they

1791.679 --> 1795.8400000000001
were amazing beings

1793.44 --> 1795.8400000000001
or both

1796.72 --> 1801.279
you know ingenuity is really one of the

1800.159 --> 1803.6000000000001
bigger parts of

1801.279 --> 1805.6
like the fantastical artist it's not

1803.6 --> 1807.84
just the quality of what you see it's

1805.6 --> 1810.0
also of how it's made and how it was

1807.84 --> 1814.0
planned

1810.0 --> 1818.559
and since michelangelo was definitely a

1814.0 --> 1818.799
designer it's very likely that he would

1818.559 --> 1823.12
have

1818.799 --> 1825.9189999999999
organized things so well

1823.12 --> 1827.4399999999998
the fabrication of big things because he

1825.919 --> 1829.8400000000001
was a designer so

1827.44 --> 1831.3600000000001
why yeah you're not just gonna oh let's

1829.84 --> 1833.6
just start painting

1831.36 --> 1834.4799999999998
no he would have like really pl

1833.6 --> 1838.6399999999999
pre-planned it

1834.48 --> 1844.0
and as i said maybe made a micro model

1838.64 --> 1844.0
and then painted it and then basically

1844.32 --> 1849.279
yeah took a kind of panel system

1849.84 --> 1852.9599999999998
based on that micro model and then

1852.32 --> 1857.84
painted

1852.96 --> 1861.76
every bit and then installed it

1857.84 --> 1865.36
that would probably be a lot less hassle

1861.76 --> 1868.64
but maybe i'm wrong i don't know

1865.36 --> 1871.1999999999998
nasa technology being found what slo-mo

1868.64 --> 1871.2
moon buggy

1876.84 --> 1879.84
what

1904.84 --> 1907.84
hmm

1917.519 --> 1924.24
oh the apollo technology

1920.88 --> 1925.3600000000001
what but i thought that technology was

1924.24 --> 1929.84
destroyed

1925.36 --> 1935.84
slow mo moon buggy you said they found

1929.84 --> 1935.84
they found it back

1936.799 --> 1940.32
do you know anything about astro

1938.559 --> 1943.12
projection

1940.32 --> 1943.12
well yeah

1945.919 --> 1949.8400000000001
i'm not really an expert at it i haven't

1948.72 --> 1962.0
focused much

1949.84 --> 1965.1999999999998
on doing it but i do know how it works

1962.0 --> 1977.84
it's in hollywood what the hell what are

1965.2 --> 1977.8400000000001
you talking about slow mo moon buggy

1996.24 --> 1999.279
you want to do it

2000.159 --> 2007.679
all right well if you want to do it

2004.64 --> 2009.919
i don't know why though

2007.679 --> 2009.919
but

2017.279 --> 2023.76
it's all about focus so if you're gonna

2020.48 --> 2027.919
astrally project it is kind of like

2023.76 --> 2033.84
using your imagination visualization

2027.919 --> 2033.8400000000001
and then

2037.2 --> 2042.799
kind of like yeah project that outward

2043.919 --> 2047.76
and then somehow it works for some

2046.799 --> 2052.24
people at least

2047.76 --> 2052.24
they can basically if they can

2052.48 --> 2056.2400000000002
like prevent the tension from snapping

2055.28 --> 2058.079
themselves

2056.24 --> 2060.72
their own consciousness back in their

2058.079 --> 2062.8
body you can use it to kind of like keep

2060.72 --> 2066.24
your dream hanging

2062.8 --> 2068.3990000000003
and then by focusing with your

2066.24 --> 2070.0
with literally your consciousness in the

2068.399 --> 2072.159
process focusing on

2070.0 --> 2074.639
certain type of object you're familiar

2072.159 --> 2076.2400000000002
with or a person

2074.639 --> 2079.28
but especially when this when you're

2076.24 --> 2082.24
familiar with the surrounding somewhat

2079.28 --> 2084.5600000000004
it helps you to focus to basically move

2082.24 --> 2089.839
there

2084.56 --> 2089.839
during the astral projection

2095.839 --> 2099.92
like i think i probably have done it as

2098.0 --> 2103.119
well like during sleep

2099.92 --> 2107.04
it's just that

2103.119 --> 2107.04
it kind of like happens by accident

2108.8 --> 2112.1600000000003
every time i've had it it always

2110.8 --> 2115.52
happened by accident

2112.16 --> 2119.04
it's usually because i

2115.52 --> 2120.48
yeah because it was driven by obsession

2119.04 --> 2123.2
over something

2120.48 --> 2123.2
or someone

2124.0 --> 2127.44
i don't know in my personal experience

2126.079 --> 2131.8390000000004
it's never been really

2127.44 --> 2131.839
really an appealing good thing

2136.4 --> 2145.839
dreams aren't real yeah they are

2152.64 --> 2159.2
yeah with proper astral projection

2156.0 --> 2163.68
you can actually remember details

2159.2 --> 2167.4399999999996
about a place even details that were

2163.68 --> 2170.48
altered since you last was there to

2167.44 --> 2173.92
physically observe it right

2170.48 --> 2176.72
so yeah it's real if you can get

2173.92 --> 2179.28
yourself to do it properly

2176.72 --> 2182.0
but yeah there it doesn't work for

2179.28 --> 2182.0
everyone though

2183.2 --> 2188.96
most people that i know that have like

2186.48 --> 2192.4
talent to do astral projection they kind

2188.96 --> 2194.16
of start out doing it by accident

2192.4 --> 2196.88
it just overcomes them and it's a

2194.16 --> 2201.839
special kind of sensation

2196.88 --> 2201.839
it feels different from regular dreaming

2218.64 --> 2222.72
hello barry davies yes i'm fine

2223.92 --> 2228.0
in which sense are dream real well that

2226.32 --> 2232.079
depends on what type of dream it

2228.0 --> 2236.64
is but like the experience is

2232.079 --> 2239.3590000000004
is a spiritual dynamic experience

2236.64 --> 2241.44
depending on like yeah what frequency

2239.359 --> 2244.4
you're at

2241.44 --> 2246.16
during the dream experience like the

2244.4 --> 2249.6800000000003
things that happen

2246.16 --> 2250.72
do really happen there and have an

2249.68 --> 2253.839
influence

2250.72 --> 2256.3999999999996
a palpable influence

2253.839 --> 2257.04
sometimes like entangling your mood or

2256.4 --> 2260.96
whatever

2257.04 --> 2265.2
on the long run or altering things that

2260.96 --> 2265.2
that burdened you for a long time

2265.52 --> 2271.839
so yeah i take dreams very serious

2273.839 --> 2278.16
here it takes a lot of meditation well

2276.0 --> 2281.2
yeah the meditation part amanda young is

2278.16 --> 2284.24
mostly to prevent

2281.2 --> 2288.0
the the snapping out of it right

2284.24 --> 2291.2
because i've tried it actively and that

2288.0 --> 2294.64
i would like

2291.2 --> 2297.68
it would have to be very serious for me

2294.64 --> 2300.7999999999997
to be able to not to

2297.68 --> 2303.839
yeah keep the tension off

2300.8 --> 2305.599
to make me snap out of it

2303.839 --> 2306.88
right because that's the real issue and

2305.599 --> 2308.88
yeah that's where your

2306.88 --> 2311.04
where meditation comes in it's really

2308.88 --> 2312.079
like the focus to prevent the tension

2311.04 --> 2316.079
from snapping you

2312.079 --> 2318.2400000000002
out of it to actively hold yourself in

2316.079 --> 2322.079
that dream state

2318.24 --> 2322.0789999999997
and not letting the wake-up call get to

2324.839 --> 2327.839
you

2336.88 --> 2341.839
okay agm sure

2347.119 --> 2354.2400000000002
yeah well if you're gonna go with like

2350.48 --> 2357.68
dude you can't just say okay some

2354.24 --> 2358.24
obviously evil person has this unique

2357.68 --> 2361.359
talent

2358.24 --> 2361.9199999999996
and is promoting it that means it is

2361.359 --> 2364.88
evil

2361.92 --> 2365.839
because an evil person promoted it good

2364.88 --> 2369.119
luck with that

2365.839 --> 2372.4
by that standard there is no good thing

2369.119 --> 2375.28
any person could ever do because

2372.4 --> 2376.88
there's been some evil person in history

2375.28 --> 2379.28
that has mastered it

2376.88 --> 2379.28
and then

2380.24 --> 2387.9199999999996
and then promoted it right

2383.44 --> 2387.92
everything so good luck with that

2390.88 --> 2399.079
but yeah in general astral projection

2395.599 --> 2402.079
it is it is basically

2399.079 --> 2405.3590000000004
manipulating yourself in a way

2402.079 --> 2408.319
with yeah your spirit activities

2405.359 --> 2409.2799999999997
so it's not something that i would just

2408.319 --> 2412.88
normalize

2409.28 --> 2425.8390000000004
it would never be a riskless thing

2412.88 --> 2425.839
like that

2431.68 --> 2443.52
so yeah doesn't mean it is demonic

2439.68 --> 2443.52
it's just not without its risks

2444.8 --> 2456.5600000000004
behind her eyes oh god

2453.119 --> 2456.56
was it the movie i thought it was a

2464.839 --> 2467.839
series

2494.64 --> 2500.8799999999997
night with the cows what

2498.24 --> 2500.8799999999997
[ __ ] off

2501.28 --> 2504.3190000000004
not interested

2504.48 --> 2511.119
please keep the freaking troll

2507.599 --> 2511.119
activities out of here we're not

2520.839 --> 2523.839
interested

2532.48 --> 2539.76
hmm hi nicotine

2535.599 --> 2539.76
uh good luck with that

2543.44 --> 2547.119
you know what also produces some vivid

2546.079 --> 2550.7200000000003
dreams

2547.119 --> 2552.96
magnesium taking magnesium

2550.72 --> 2554.0
before going to bed now that can deliver

2552.96 --> 2564.7200000000003
you quite some

2554.0 --> 2568.079
intense dreams

2564.72 --> 2569.4399999999996
so y'all telling me that's evil no i'm

2568.079 --> 2572.1600000000003
not telling you it's evil

2569.44 --> 2572.8
i'm just telling you it's not something

2572.16 --> 2575.44
you want to

2572.8 --> 2576.8390000000004
engage at because i don't know you're

2575.44 --> 2579.839
bored

2576.839 --> 2579.839
right

2581.44 --> 2584.7200000000003
like either you have the talent and you

2584.24 --> 2586.72
feel

2584.72 --> 2589.2
you should do something with it or it's

2586.72 --> 2593.9199999999996
gonna do something with you

2589.2 --> 2597.1189999999997
or well maybe you should try to

2593.92 --> 2597.92
not get distracted by those types of

2597.119 --> 2601.6800000000003
skills

2597.92 --> 2601.6800000000003
like it's not good for you

2604.72 --> 2608.56
right especially if you have like

2606.96 --> 2610.88
earthly

2608.56 --> 2612.72
desires or things you want to accomplish

2610.88 --> 2615.599
and then you use

2612.72 --> 2616.56
astral projection for it kind of like

2615.599 --> 2618.6400000000003
which

2616.56 --> 2622.7999999999997
it's not good thing it's not good for

2618.64 --> 2622.7999999999997
your spirit on the long run to do that

2622.88 --> 2635.839
it locks you in in a way i i recommend

2626.0 --> 2635.839
against it

2639.76 --> 2642.8
right anyway

2644.4 --> 2651.52
right so in a sense if people

2648.16 --> 2654.7999999999997
just had like astro projection

2651.52 --> 2657.44
dreams things and they're weirded out

2654.8 --> 2658.2400000000002
and they want to get it under control

2657.44 --> 2661.28
yeah i

2658.24 --> 2664.64
definitely help with that i try

2661.28 --> 2666.88
i try to help them focus but

2664.64 --> 2668.4
it's not so it's not like a skill that i

2666.88 --> 2677.839
would like oh yeah let's just teach a

2668.4 --> 2677.839
whole bunch of people to do it

2687.44 --> 2696.16
yeah agm that's nonsense it

2690.56 --> 2699.119
it's not as simple as that anything

2696.16 --> 2700.56
can open doorways for demonic spirits to

2699.119 --> 2705.839
enter you

2700.56 --> 2705.839
they do it all the time

2726.16 --> 2733.92
what's that new ecclesiastes

2730.24 --> 2747.839
i don't know that can you can you ride

2733.92 --> 2747.839
it out

2751.359 --> 2755.92
nonsense is it ask people who have

2754.56 --> 2758.24
messed with astra and hear their

2755.92 --> 2761.52
testimony i have

2758.24 --> 2763.839
like do you remember uh what's his name

2761.52 --> 2763.839
again

2768.319 --> 2770.64
ah

2772.56 --> 2776.56
it's been a while since i heard from him

2774.56 --> 2780.0
and he talked about astral projection

2776.56 --> 2780.0
all the time what was his name again

2780.8 --> 2785.28
oh yeah the horizon hori

2785.599 --> 2790.1600000000003
he he had it as a staple subject because

2788.4 --> 2793.839
he is one of those guys

2790.16 --> 2796.56
that has the skill it just overcomes him

2793.839 --> 2803.839
and he learned to control it right

2796.56 --> 2803.839
that's okay

2818.4 --> 2821.599
totally once again right well i i am

2821.2 --> 2824.96
with

2821.599 --> 2828.079
i am with you am i not warning you

2824.96 --> 2829.92
neil am i not warning you agm am i not

2828.079 --> 2831.76
saying yeah that's risky i don't

2829.92 --> 2834.56
recommend it if you don't

2831.76 --> 2836.2400000000002
already have it right if you have it

2834.56 --> 2838.64
it's happening to you

2836.24 --> 2839.2799999999997
then it's kind of useful to get control

2838.64 --> 2841.2799999999997
over it

2839.28 --> 2842.7200000000003
right or it's going to take control over

2841.28 --> 2845.8390000000004
you right

2842.72 --> 2849.2
because that gate is already opened

2845.839 --> 2849.92
right but if it's something that you

2849.2 --> 2852.24
don't have

2849.92 --> 2853.04
you don't necessarily want to break it

2852.24 --> 2855.68
open

2853.04 --> 2858.079
that might be dangerous might have

2855.68 --> 2858.48
unforeseen consequences it's gonna lock

2858.079 --> 2861.6800000000003
you

2858.48 --> 2864.96
into a spiritual trajectory right

2861.68 --> 2868.16
every power comes with a price

2864.96 --> 2870.48
that's a fact every power comes

2868.16 --> 2871.68
with a price if it's not a power you

2870.48 --> 2875.359
already have

2871.68 --> 2877.52
then attaining a power will have a price

2875.359 --> 2880.319
it doesn't really matter what it is

2877.52 --> 2881.04
whether it's really physical social

2880.319 --> 2884.4
spiritual

2881.04 --> 2886.4
magical anything if you attain a power

2884.4 --> 2889.6800000000003
that you did not already have

2886.4 --> 2889.6800000000003
there's going to be a price

2892.079 --> 2896.8
right so if you already have these types

2894.96 --> 2901.839
of experiences

2896.8 --> 2901.8390000000004
then learn to deal with them

2902.64 --> 2906.4
like you already have it what's it's

2904.96 --> 2909.599
already there

2906.4 --> 2911.119
what's gonna happen you know

2909.599 --> 2913.28
well the worst that could happen if you

2911.119 --> 2914.0
already have it is you gain control over

2913.28 --> 2917.44
it and then you

2914.0 --> 2920.559
might kind of like start abusing it

2917.44 --> 2923.119
as leverage right now that's where you

2920.559 --> 2923.76
are corrupting because of the actions

2923.119 --> 2926.8
you take

2923.76 --> 2928.2400000000002
with the power you already had but if

2926.8 --> 2930.48
you don't have that

2928.24 --> 2932.3999999999996
you have another type of balance another

2930.48 --> 2935.839
framework for your spirit

2932.4 --> 2938.96
well then attaining a new power like

2935.839 --> 2942.319
that might actually detract

2938.96 --> 2945.52
from other things

2942.319 --> 2948.88
that are there without that power right

2945.52 --> 2953.44
every power has a price

2948.88 --> 2956.8
literally you have only so much energy

2953.44 --> 2962.16
and a lot of it is in a place

2956.8 --> 2962.1600000000003
for a reason and balances how you are

2965.76 --> 2969.119
right so don't worry about it

2969.2 --> 2972.7999999999997
don't worry too much don't don't get too

2971.839 --> 2976.64
scared

2972.8 --> 2976.6400000000003
from oh if you do anything

2976.72 --> 2981.2799999999997
if you do anything that's unusual then

2979.28 --> 2983.92
oh immediately the devil

2981.28 --> 2984.4
no no that's not how it works it's just

2983.92 --> 2987.44
about

2984.4 --> 2988.48
power power corruption it's about spirit

2987.44 --> 2991.2000000000003
energy

2988.48 --> 2992.0
preponderance of it things that happen

2991.2 --> 2994.64
that you might not

2992.0 --> 2996.559
even realize or that you take for

2994.64 --> 3000.24
granted

2996.559 --> 3003.0400000000004
of which yeah if you try to grab

3000.24 --> 3003.52
some skill that is not really down your

3003.04 --> 3006.88
lane

3003.52 --> 3007.839
it's gonna basically cause you to

3006.88 --> 3009.6800000000003
rearrange

3007.839 --> 3012.48
how things work in yourself and you

3009.68 --> 3014.7999999999997
might lose certain things

3012.48 --> 3017.04
that you taken for granted you didn't

3014.8 --> 3017.599
even realize it was there until you lose

3017.04 --> 3027.839
it

3017.599 --> 3027.839
right just don't do it

3030.64 --> 3040.64
that's my teaching right

3034.079 --> 3043.92
sorry if it seems too sensible

3040.64 --> 3048.7999999999997
but i know from experience

3043.92 --> 3051.92
right i try to attain a lot of things

3048.8 --> 3052.88
and it damaged me effectively and i've

3051.92 --> 3056.8
been working my

3052.88 --> 3060.4
entire life to kind of undo the damage

3056.8 --> 3060.4
and wondering if i still can

3060.559 --> 3063.6800000000003
and all this [ __ ] happened when i was

3062.4 --> 3066.0
really young and i got

3063.68 --> 3067.04
really obsessed with magical powers like

3066.0 --> 3070.4
as a really

3067.04 --> 3073.2799999999997
really young kid pre-teen

3070.4 --> 3074.96
weird [ __ ] happened with me vision [ __ ]

3073.28 --> 3078.48
really heavy stuff

3074.96 --> 3080.2400000000002
heavy big dreams with wizards and creepy

3078.48 --> 3083.52
figures and witches

3080.24 --> 3085.1189999999997
in dreams people with pretty astounding

3083.52 --> 3088.079
looking clothing

3085.119 --> 3088.88
in the dark world that i've never seen

3088.079 --> 3091.52
ever

3088.88 --> 3092.7200000000003
i've never seen those people but i

3091.52 --> 3097.839
communicated

3092.72 --> 3097.839
with them in my dreams it's freaky

3100.0 --> 3104.16
like no no wonder you start to wonder

3101.92 --> 3106.64
like am i a sorcerer or something

3104.16 --> 3107.44
i got all these weird experiences and

3106.64 --> 3110.24
just these

3107.44 --> 3111.839
things that i'm learning and knowing

3110.24 --> 3112.5589999999997
things in the future even though i'm

3111.839 --> 3114.48
very young

3112.559 --> 3116.96
and that makes you feel rel really

3114.48 --> 3119.599
powerful but yeah i didn't even realize

3116.96 --> 3119.599
back then that

3119.92 --> 3125.28
i didn't have that power it had me

3123.44 --> 3127.599
it was all very dangerous what i was

3125.28 --> 3127.599
doing

3132.24 --> 3139.839
but it yeah just it just it happened

3142.4 --> 3147.599
and just glad that i've matured

3147.68 --> 3152.72
and i take it a lot more serious all of

3149.839 --> 3154.16
it every experience i have every dream i

3152.72 --> 3157.2
have every

3154.16 --> 3160.5589999999997
switch anything anything that happens i

3157.2 --> 3160.5589999999997
all take it very serious

3161.119 --> 3165.119
can you control your dreams with astral

3163.28 --> 3170.48
projection

3165.119 --> 3170.48
no it's the other way around

3171.04 --> 3174.8
astral projection is

3176.4 --> 3184.079
extra spiritual activity dreams

3179.76 --> 3186.6400000000003
are like the interface mechanism

3184.079 --> 3187.599
and your dreams are just purely in the

3186.64 --> 3190.7999999999997
other dimension

3187.599 --> 3194.2400000000002
it's not in the physical realm

3190.8 --> 3197.28
and yeah you can project visuals

3194.24 --> 3200.0
based on the real world into the

3197.28 --> 3201.0400000000004
extra dimensional realm where you go in

3200.0 --> 3205.52
your dreams

3201.04 --> 3206.079
simulated and that's very different from

3205.52 --> 3209.2
when you

3206.079 --> 3210.96
actually project into with your spirit

3209.2 --> 3212.96
into the real world

3210.96 --> 3215.52
to see it this very different type of

3212.96 --> 3215.52
experience

3218.559 --> 3222.559
dream control you really do through your

3220.559 --> 3225.92
own consciousness through

3222.559 --> 3226.2400000000002
awareness of dream dynamics and like the

3225.92 --> 3227.6800000000003
mo

3226.24 --> 3230.24
how to deal with the moment of

3227.68 --> 3232.7999999999997
realization it is a dream

3230.24 --> 3232.7999999999997
all that

3234.72 --> 3238.16
right one mechanism that i use to deal

3237.28 --> 3241.52
with my dreams

3238.16 --> 3243.68
is to realize that it's real

3241.52 --> 3245.839
and that when i dream i'm literally in

3243.68 --> 3248.5589999999997
another dimension

3245.839 --> 3248.5589999999997
that is real

3248.88 --> 3253.119
where i could technically bump into

3251.52 --> 3255.52
other spirits

3253.119 --> 3257.6800000000003
if i'd be open up to that and there's

3255.52 --> 3259.92
like a filter a frequency filter

3257.68 --> 3262.48
depending on your state

3259.92 --> 3264.64
and if you're very vulnerable and you by

3262.48 --> 3266.559
accident enter into a deep dream then

3264.64 --> 3267.839
they might just connect with you and

3266.559 --> 3270.079
mess with you

3267.839 --> 3271.2
that includes bad spirits that is all

3270.079 --> 3275.28
possible

3271.2 --> 3279.1189999999997
i've managed to really carefully

3275.28 --> 3282.079
build my filter to prevent

3279.119 --> 3283.6800000000003
dark entities from entering my dream

3282.079 --> 3285.52
bubble

3283.68 --> 3287.839
and it hasn't really happened in a long

3285.52 --> 3288.48
time like things get resolved when i

3287.839 --> 3292.0
sleep

3288.48 --> 3294.0
in dreams i never have like oh my god i

3292.0 --> 3294.96
have like this terrible nightmare and

3294.0 --> 3298.0
suddenly i'm

3294.96 --> 3299.44
all feeling all bad waking up no that

3298.0 --> 3303.2
doesn't happen

3299.44 --> 3305.2000000000003
ever it's always better

3303.2 --> 3307.2
i thank god for that because i've had

3305.2 --> 3309.7599999999998
some really horrific

3307.2 --> 3312.72
influence from nightmares in the past

3309.76 --> 3312.7200000000003
way in the past

3313.68 --> 3317.04
as a young kid i was often very very

3316.16 --> 3319.359
haunted like

3317.04 --> 3322.16
really terrified out of my mind because

3319.359 --> 3322.16
of my dreams

3322.559 --> 3325.599
but since i learned to take the dream

3325.2 --> 3328.5589999999997
realm

3325.599 --> 3329.6800000000003
serious and real and stop listening to

3328.559 --> 3332.079
people that tell you

3329.68 --> 3335.839
dreams aren't real don't take it serious

3332.079 --> 3339.52
that's the worst advice ever

3335.839 --> 3342.48
right that's like poo pooing like oh no

3339.52 --> 3345.04
you dr you dreamt it that means it's not

3342.48 --> 3347.28
real even though you have absolutely

3345.04 --> 3349.839
experienced it and it has a visceral

3347.28 --> 3349.8390000000004
influence

3351.119 --> 3355.28
after i started my taking my dreams a

3352.96 --> 3356.4
lot more serious and basically defending

3355.28 --> 3358.559
against that

3356.4 --> 3359.839
that stance from people dreams aren't

3358.559 --> 3362.799
real just like

3359.839 --> 3363.7599999999998
no you're just stupid not necessarily

3362.799 --> 3367.119
telling them but

3363.76 --> 3367.6800000000003
knowing that and since that i've just

3367.119 --> 3371.119
learned to

3367.68 --> 3373.2799999999997
get more control over the whole process

3371.119 --> 3374.559
and with that completely prevent

3373.28 --> 3378.079
nightmares from

3374.559 --> 3378.559
unfolding right not that i never have

3378.079 --> 3381.76
any

3378.559 --> 3384.2400000000002
bad dream like experiences anymore but

3381.76 --> 3386.4
most of them now happen while i'm awake

3384.24 --> 3388.799
and have a lot more control so i just

3386.4 --> 3390.4
dwell on things that i really don't want

3388.799 --> 3392.48
to know about

3390.4 --> 3394.64
like really don't want to know about

3392.48 --> 3397.68
terrible things sometimes

3394.64 --> 3400.48
and that's why i also never

3397.68 --> 3400.48
talk about it

3403.44 --> 3408.48
because there's just things that

3406.559 --> 3409.8390000000004
happen in the world that are just

3408.48 --> 3413.28
terrible and i like i

3409.839 --> 3416.4
cannot resolve it

3413.28 --> 3416.96
like i i cannot justify the existence

3416.4 --> 3421.28
like

3416.96 --> 3421.28
even with my fractal inside it's

3427.04 --> 3437.359
they are things that

3433.839 --> 3442.0789999999997
i don't know that make me

3437.359 --> 3447.839
doubt the creator not that he exists

3442.079 --> 3447.8390000000004
but what what he wants

3448.48 --> 3451.76
and it's not a good thing

3452.88 --> 3460.319
that i have that it's just that

3456.96 --> 3463.52
truth god is truth i i can't stop it i

3460.319 --> 3466.799
have to figure it out i it has to

3463.52 --> 3466.799
compute i have to

3468.16 --> 3472.48
i have to make it fit

3473.04 --> 3478.96
i had i need to understand the purpose

3476.16 --> 3480.319
of all that really [ __ ] up [ __ ] out

3478.96 --> 3483.52
there

3480.319 --> 3487.119
like what can justify that

3483.52 --> 3489.52
in the entirety of creation i don't know

3487.119 --> 3492.319
because i don't understand and that

3489.52 --> 3492.319
frustrates me

3500.839 --> 3503.839
right

3510.96 --> 3517.839
i think god wants us to garden earth

3513.68 --> 3517.839
well that's in the basic design yes

3518.48 --> 3525.359
that's what what is it

3522.16 --> 3528.5589999999997
a fruitful endeavor right

3525.359 --> 3530.48
that's the good things to do that

3528.559 --> 3533.28
but that's like the template that was

3530.48 --> 3536.88
like the what the template

3533.28 --> 3539.92
perfected by jesus christ handed us the

3536.88 --> 3539.92
logos template

3540.48 --> 3544.0
but that that's not in the same that is

3543.44 --> 3546.559
about what

3544.0 --> 3548.88
should you do what is the the wisest

3546.559 --> 3551.599
course of action

3548.88 --> 3553.839
that's not the same as what i'm getting

3551.599 --> 3556.88
bothered with

3553.839 --> 3560.48
it's like no figuring out

3556.88 --> 3562.799
everything that exists in all periods

3560.48 --> 3562.799
why

3563.52 --> 3569.68
like and like also i guess trying to

3566.96 --> 3571.76
against better judgment fathom cosmic

3569.68 --> 3577.1189999999997
justice like the real creators

3571.76 --> 3577.119
justice because i have trouble

3579.359 --> 3585.119
like i can't i'm losing

3582.88 --> 3586.079
often the ability to just say like now

3585.119 --> 3589.599
god

3586.079 --> 3593.28
god's got it all sorted because

3589.599 --> 3596.319
yeah that would be faith but isn't that

3593.28 --> 3601.8390000000004
wrong isn't actual knowledge and

3596.319 --> 3601.839
understanding really the key

3602.24 --> 3605.9199999999996
right it's it's a big dilemma so i'm

3604.96 --> 3610.079
just

3605.92 --> 3613.6800000000003
based on that i guess my my course

3610.079 --> 3616.4
my my wizard striving to know

3613.68 --> 3617.9199999999996
to really figure out in between where

3616.4 --> 3620.88
nobody thinks

3617.92 --> 3623.839
they just get to that position where

3620.88 --> 3623.839
they just start to

3625.44 --> 3629.44
take an action based on faith justify

3628.16 --> 3634.0789999999997
things based on faith

3629.44 --> 3637.92
instead of actually trying to understand

3634.079 --> 3638.48
it's difficult and it in a lot of ways

3637.92 --> 3640.319
it feels

3638.48 --> 3643.839
like it is kind of a waste of time but

3640.319 --> 3643.839
it is part of what i do

3658.88 --> 3662.96
right so yeah a person

3663.52 --> 3667.7599999999998
worrying and trying to puzzle out cosmic

3667.04 --> 3672.4
justice

3667.76 --> 3675.5200000000004
is it's quite a crazy task

3672.4 --> 3679.04
right it's specifically advised against

3675.52 --> 3682.64
in general like no just leave

3679.04 --> 3684.72
leave judgment to god because you can't

3682.64 --> 3688.16
handle it well i can attest to that

3684.72 --> 3690.9599999999996
yeah i know i can't handle it i am

3688.16 --> 3692.799
trying to figure it out i'm trying to

3690.96 --> 3696.0
get it better though

3692.799 --> 3699.44
to have a real earthed

3696.0 --> 3702.88
rooted confidence in when i would

3699.44 --> 3704.319
say just trust god because i need to

3702.88 --> 3707.76
kind of know

3704.319 --> 3707.7599999999998
why and

3708.72 --> 3716.64
and not just like enjoy the fruit

3712.24 --> 3720.0
and don't look at the darkness

3716.64 --> 3720.0
because it is still there

3721.359 --> 3728.24
right don't lean on my understanding

3724.48 --> 3731.52
excuse me and i will absolutely i lean

3728.24 --> 3731.52
on my own understanding

3734.16 --> 3746.799
jesus existed jesus was born in nazareth

3742.799 --> 3749.599
i think so yeah don't go

3746.799 --> 3755.839
don't go trinity chanting on me please

3749.599 --> 3755.839
good servant

3766.839 --> 3769.839
so

3777.06 --> 3780.989
[Music]

3786.48 --> 3797.839
oh by the way hello tom parker did i say

3789.44 --> 3797.839
hello yet

3850.839 --> 3856.16
uh

3853.359 --> 3856.72
but yeah the there is the risk the rule

3856.16 --> 3859.5989999999997
of fist

3856.72 --> 3861.2799999999997
it works great if you send out good

3859.599 --> 3864.319
intentions

3861.28 --> 3865.52
it will come back whether you're ready

3864.319 --> 3868.88
to receive it

3865.52 --> 3870.64
or even recognize that you could receive

3868.88 --> 3871.2000000000003
it that it is out there for you to

3870.64 --> 3874.319
receive

3871.2 --> 3877.0389999999998
is another matter right

3874.319 --> 3877.68
a lot of people are blocked by their own

3877.039 --> 3880.3190000000004
personal

3877.68 --> 3882.3999999999996
judgment preventing them from accepting

3880.319 --> 3884.88
things that they need

3882.4 --> 3886.4
because of prior judgment as a

3884.88 --> 3890.0
punishment and they don't even know it

3886.4 --> 3890.0
it's just a locked in mechanism

3890.88 --> 3898.48
but yes things always go better

3895.92 --> 3899.119
when you follow or attempt to follow

3898.48 --> 3903.2
logos

3899.119 --> 3905.359
try to find your way through with logos

3903.2 --> 3907.52
going in that direction trying it out

3905.359 --> 3910.96
somehow

3907.52 --> 3910.96
things always do go better

3911.92 --> 3921.2000000000003
so there is a cosmic justice

3917.52 --> 3924.24
in that sense it's just that

3921.2 --> 3927.0389999999998
besides that subjective personal

3924.24 --> 3928.0
view and the response of god and

3927.039 --> 3931.2000000000003
judgment

3928.0 --> 3933.2
there is also because that's like the

3931.2 --> 3936.3999999999996
part of the design that's god's design

3933.2 --> 3937.9199999999996
that makes that happen like that but

3936.4 --> 3941.2000000000003
another

3937.92 --> 3943.839
part of me is just like

3941.2 --> 3945.9199999999996
trying to zoom out and then get the

3943.839 --> 3948.0789999999997
fractal of the entire thing

3945.92 --> 3951.119
and what it means and what it means to

3948.079 --> 3955.039
those that

3951.119 --> 3957.92
seem to perish in total injustice

3955.039 --> 3958.2400000000002
like how how is that possible do they

3957.92 --> 3961.2000000000003
get

3958.24 --> 3962.8799999999997
like a prior reward from god of moments

3961.2 --> 3966.8799999999997
of glory do they

3962.88 --> 3971.039
get swept off and get extraordinary

3966.88 --> 3975.359
experiences or special reincarnations or

3971.039 --> 3978.4
something right i'm i'm just

3975.359 --> 3981.52
foolishly desperately trying to get a

3978.4 --> 3981.52
better grip on it

3984.96 --> 3991.68
and that's why i i dwell in

3989.2 --> 3993.0389999999998
creepy places with my mind sometimes

3991.68 --> 3996.799
without letting it

3993.039 --> 3999.3590000000004
damage me as i try to

3996.799 --> 4001.0389999999998
sniff the freak yes i try basically to

3999.359 --> 4004.839
hold my breath

4001.039 --> 4008.2400000000002
not absorb the frequency of that of that

4004.839 --> 4011.359
sickness it's tough it that

4008.24 --> 4015.4399999999996
has always been very tough my empathy is

4011.359 --> 4019.2799999999997
i guess i'm training my empathy with it

4015.44 --> 4023.2000000000003
to prevent absorbing

4019.28 --> 4027.119
that which i dwell upon it's tough

4023.2 --> 4027.1189999999997
but i need training i guess

4027.839 --> 4036.24
like i need to make my sensitivity

4031.52 --> 4039.68
the sharpness of the tool and not

4036.24 --> 4042.319
a tool that i constantly cut myself on

4039.68 --> 4044.64
right i need to do that i need to get

4042.319 --> 4047.92
this under control

4044.64 --> 4050.48
and it's been coming a long time i need

4047.92 --> 4050.48
to get it

4056.16 --> 4060.16
you can overthink things no [ __ ] tiny

4058.72 --> 4062.319
womble you think

4060.16 --> 4064.24
you think i can overthink things yeah

4062.319 --> 4068.5589999999997
yeah i know i can

4064.24 --> 4071.2799999999997
the thing is i'm good at it

4068.559 --> 4072.799
and i don't lose everything in the

4071.28 --> 4075.44
process i don't

4072.799 --> 4077.7599999999998
overthink things to lose track to lose

4075.44 --> 4079.359
myself no i'm actually it's in a

4077.76 --> 4082.0
controlled framework that's

4079.359 --> 4082.0
very big

4082.4 --> 4085.599
so yes it is overthinking but it serves

4084.799 --> 4088.48
a purpose

4085.599 --> 4090.7200000000003
and it is a finite process it is a

4088.48 --> 4094.2400000000002
process that could theoretically find

4090.72 --> 4097.679
completion not just wild growth

4094.24 --> 4100.88
they'll die and then leave no nothing

4097.679 --> 4102.88
i don't think like that anymore ever

4100.88 --> 4104.2390000000005
everything is part of the framework

4102.88 --> 4106.159000000001
every time i think about

4104.239 --> 4108.4
something i puzzle something it's part

4106.159 --> 4109.92
of the framework it's part of a lifelong

4108.4 --> 4113.759
mission of

4109.92 --> 4113.759
the purest of understanding

4114.799 --> 4119.839
even through into the other dimensions

4121.759 --> 4133.839
right tiny one more i appreciate that

4144.839 --> 4147.839
uh

4186.839 --> 4189.839
so

4191.359 --> 4203.84
we are in a grace period what does what

4193.359 --> 4203.84
do you mean good servant

4214.84 --> 4220.88
so

4217.6 --> 4222.8
but i mean like really look at you

4220.88 --> 4225.28
look at the world you think that that's

4222.8 --> 4231.84
grace you think that's

4225.28 --> 4231.84
there's graciousness happening out there

4237.36 --> 4241.5199999999995
it's the only grace really that's left

4240.32 --> 4244.88
is what people

4241.52 --> 4249.040000000001
hold on to for themselves in a like in

4244.88 --> 4249.04
struggle against the seductions of the

4256.84 --> 4259.84
world

4261.12 --> 4264.159
yeah well good luck with that good

4262.8 --> 4266.08
servant

4264.159 --> 4269.679
you're still going to be judged by your

4266.08 --> 4274.32
actions by god

4269.679 --> 4277.76
right jesus is not the ticket

4274.32 --> 4281.28
that just gives you a free for all

4277.76 --> 4284.2390000000005
it is not at all just believing jesus

4281.28 --> 4284.639999999999
is not going to save your soul if you're

4284.239 --> 4287.759999999999
just

4284.64 --> 4289.84
using it as an excuse to be nasty and

4287.76 --> 4292.400000000001
corrupted

4289.84 --> 4293.360000000001
the only ticket is actually following

4292.4 --> 4296.639999999999
the advice

4293.36 --> 4299.12
doing it knowing it saying it

4296.64 --> 4301.1990000000005
does nothing doing it is the only thing

4299.12 --> 4304.4
that actually does something

4301.199 --> 4315.839999999999
that has a result on the spirit and on

4304.4 --> 4315.839999999999
on your life and the afterlife

4333.12 --> 4337.679
right yeah and what does that mean agm

4336.0 --> 4340.56
does that mean you have to say

4337.679 --> 4342.4
jesus is god and his father and the holy

4340.56 --> 4344.96
spirit all at the same time

4342.4 --> 4346.0
is that the thing that that means or

4344.96 --> 4349.84
does it means

4346.0 --> 4353.679
wait no jesus actually esoterically

4349.84 --> 4356.64
found a way through the solution

4353.679 --> 4358.4
to ascend from the earthliness the

4356.64 --> 4361.360000000001
earthly spirit the

4358.4 --> 4362.159
the down below the oversimplified the

4361.36 --> 4365.199
greedy

4362.159 --> 4368.48
the short-sighted and that only

4365.199 --> 4373.04
you can reach the truth the father

4368.48 --> 4376.32
the creator through

4373.04 --> 4376.64
jesus's words through his advice through

4376.32 --> 4379.92
the

4376.64 --> 4382.320000000001
understanding yeah i don't have to chant

4379.92 --> 4384.4
jesus is this that and that and that

4382.32 --> 4386.4
means that i go to heaven and everything

4384.4 --> 4389.5199999999995
i do it's all forgiven

4386.4 --> 4393.839999999999
no way no way i'm not

4389.52 --> 4397.92
gonna be like a pr yeah that that's not

4393.84 --> 4400.159000000001
that's not correct that's what cults do

4397.92 --> 4402.08
no i'm going to just try to understand

4400.159 --> 4404.0
what it all means

4402.08 --> 4406.48
when you say those things when you use

4404.0 --> 4409.6
those tropes

4406.48 --> 4410.959999999999
i'm going to instead of just saying

4409.6 --> 4413.6
something and that's

4410.96 --> 4414.719
that's it now i'm gonna actually look at

4413.6 --> 4417.52
the words

4414.719 --> 4418.2390000000005
and then see what it really means

4417.52 --> 4421.6
besides

4418.239 --> 4423.639999999999
what you superficially thought it meant

4421.6 --> 4425.6
and then dwelled on the

4423.64 --> 4427.04
misinterpretations the esoteric

4425.6 --> 4429.280000000001
interpretation yeah

4427.04 --> 4441.84
now i'm going to dive into the actual

4429.28 --> 4441.84
meaning of things

4444.08 --> 4454.32
no if god was in charge he could remove

4448.08 --> 4456.4
evil uh no

4454.32 --> 4457.84
that's the thing everything is as it

4456.4 --> 4460.159
should be

4457.84 --> 4461.52
within the time frame everything is part

4460.159 --> 4465.759999999999
of a process

4461.52 --> 4465.76
and evil is part of that process

4466.64 --> 4469.76
it's placed there it's part of the

4468.88 --> 4473.28
design

4469.76 --> 4476.4800000000005
it does things it has a purpose

4473.28 --> 4478.159
but a purpose in the wider framework of

4476.48 --> 4480.639999999999
all things

4478.159 --> 4481.679
god can't remove it because then he

4480.64 --> 4485.76
would remove

4481.679 --> 4485.76
that which was part of the design

4489.12 --> 4495.599999999999
it's like yeah it's the test

4492.56 --> 4498.88
evil is the test

4495.6 --> 4501.1990000000005
so what what good is studying

4498.88 --> 4503.679
something and mastering something if you

4501.199 --> 4506.4
don't even get tested

4503.679 --> 4507.52
doesn't mean anything anymore it you

4506.4 --> 4509.759999999999
don't it doesn't

4507.52 --> 4511.1990000000005
you don't get the same grip on it until

4509.76 --> 4515.4400000000005
you're tested

4511.199 --> 4518.159
so yeah it's definitely

4515.44 --> 4520.0
been part of the design and that's also

4518.159 --> 4523.199
the part that i dwell on

4520.0 --> 4525.52
with my own framework understanding of

4523.199 --> 4526.4
how how can this be justified in the

4525.52 --> 4529.76
wider thing

4526.4 --> 4529.759999999999
how is this balanced out

4529.92 --> 4539.84
how is the justice truly met

4533.679 --> 4539.84
it's tough

4545.76 --> 4553.52
your actions don't count only faith no

4549.84 --> 4556.8
that's ridiculous

4553.52 --> 4558.88
that's ridiculous raziel

4556.8 --> 4560.159000000001
absolutely your actions matter your

4558.88 --> 4563.6
actions

4560.159 --> 4567.44
prove your faith don't you get it

4563.6 --> 4570.4800000000005
it's the actions that actually if you

4567.44 --> 4573.839999999999
follow the advice

4570.48 --> 4578.0
of god through jesus

4573.84 --> 4580.88
then you act on the advice

4578.0 --> 4583.28
it's the actions that actually prove the

4580.88 --> 4583.28
faith

4587.6 --> 4594.64
ask protestants uh no

4592.0 --> 4597.08
i'm not gonna ask some georgian

4594.64 --> 4599.280000000001
indoctrination group and how how they've

4597.08 --> 4601.5199999999995
degenerated from the original

4599.28 --> 4603.599999999999
philosophers

4601.52 --> 4605.280000000001
into just some standardized cookie

4603.6 --> 4607.04
cutter priest chanting

4605.28 --> 4608.5599999999995
like no this is the way you're supposed

4607.04 --> 4610.32
to do it

4608.56 --> 4612.0
and not actually attain deeper

4610.32 --> 4614.4
understanding because

4612.0 --> 4615.52
the priests are there to make it easy

4614.4 --> 4617.5199999999995
for you to get

4615.52 --> 4619.6
just you don't have to think about it

4617.52 --> 4621.120000000001
right you just do this and that and that

4619.6 --> 4622.400000000001
you live that way and then it's good

4621.12 --> 4625.04
then you go to heaven

4622.4 --> 4626.0
right yeah while the whole point is

4625.04 --> 4627.92
actually

4626.0 --> 4629.199
going through the struggle with your

4627.92 --> 4632.4800000000005
spirit and

4629.199 --> 4635.44
trying to understand it all for real

4632.48 --> 4636.239
despite what people are chanting to you

4635.44 --> 4638.879999999999
telling you

4636.239 --> 4640.32
this is how you must do it or you bet or

4638.88 --> 4642.88
you're the devil

4640.32 --> 4643.36
right that's the whole point because

4642.88 --> 4645.6
people

4643.36 --> 4646.639999999999
do do that people do start to judge

4645.6 --> 4648.4800000000005
others

4646.64 --> 4650.159000000001
because you're not doing the special boy

4648.48 --> 4652.0
trick that they demand

4650.159 --> 4653.5199999999995
you have to do because they believe that

4652.0 --> 4656.4
that is what you have to do

4653.52 --> 4657.1990000000005
no the whole point is actually digging

4656.4 --> 4660.08
through it

4657.199 --> 4661.839999999999
trying to understand it and then testing

4660.08 --> 4665.199
your knowledge

4661.84 --> 4667.360000000001
and testing your resolve with others

4665.199 --> 4668.639999999999
that are probably in those church

4667.36 --> 4672.08
communities

4668.64 --> 4674.320000000001
actually being secretly devils and they

4672.08 --> 4677.28
don't even realize it because they don't

4674.32 --> 4679.84
understand what they're doing and that

4677.28 --> 4685.199
is where the devil comes in

4679.84 --> 4688.32
you see knowledge truth is god

4685.199 --> 4691.36
lies and just not

4688.32 --> 4695.12
understanding not wanting to understand

4691.36 --> 4699.28
is the devil literally that

4695.12 --> 4702.32
literally that essence is literally that

4699.28 --> 4703.04
right you're still that person but your

4702.32 --> 4706.48
actions

4703.04 --> 4709.84
is determining what frequency

4706.48 --> 4712.48
you're actually carrying are you

4709.84 --> 4713.4400000000005
carrying the frequency of god or

4712.48 --> 4717.04
something

4713.44 --> 4720.239
as close as you can are you trying it

4717.04 --> 4723.44
or are you blocked off by

4720.239 --> 4724.159
stupid little tricks that you convinced

4723.44 --> 4726.96
yourself

4724.159 --> 4728.879999999999
are the actual process of trying to

4726.96 --> 4731.04
understand you just have to do this

4728.88 --> 4732.08
little special boy trick and that is the

4731.04 --> 4749.84
understanding

4732.08 --> 4749.84
no the understanding is understanding it

4760.84 --> 4763.84
ugh

4774.84 --> 4778.64
so

4776.719 --> 4779.84
right julie of heaven hello by the way

4778.64 --> 4783.360000000001
yeah

4779.84 --> 4784.56
that i don't know about that die for our

4783.36 --> 4787.28
sins but

4784.56 --> 4787.679
jesus i'd like to remember jesus for his

4787.28 --> 4791.36
life

4787.679 --> 4793.52
not his death right death supposed to be

4791.36 --> 4795.199
some kind of a proof that he was indeed

4793.52 --> 4798.88
divine

4795.199 --> 4801.04
i don't care i care

4798.88 --> 4803.4400000000005
about the frequency i care for the

4801.04 --> 4804.159
esoterics i care for the miracle of the

4803.44 --> 4807.759999999999
purity

4804.159 --> 4810.879999999999
of his insight and his words and actions

4807.76 --> 4813.6
that's what i care about as for the rest

4810.88 --> 4816.84
of it you're saying yeah of course

4813.6 --> 4818.159000000001
that's the process it's about the

4816.84 --> 4820.56
actions

4818.159 --> 4822.48
confessing your sins does not mean you

4820.56 --> 4823.92
walk up to a priest and you tell them

4822.48 --> 4827.199
what you've done wrong

4823.92 --> 4830.56
confessing your sins is telling

4827.199 --> 4832.32
yourself being honest with yourself

4830.56 --> 4833.639
about what you're doing what you've done

4832.32 --> 4837.04
wrong and then

4833.639 --> 4839.84
correcting it and then

4837.04 --> 4841.6
when you actually manage to correct it

4839.84 --> 4844.96
that is when your sins

4841.6 --> 4847.84
are forgiven because you stopped doing

4844.96 --> 4847.84
it

4852.96 --> 4856.8
oh razio yeah you're the special boy you

4855.36 --> 4858.96
know better

4856.8 --> 4859.84
you still believe a globe don't you yeah

4858.96 --> 4862.0
because you haven't

4859.84 --> 4864.04
ascended further into the understanding

4862.0 --> 4868.08
process and you think that just

4864.04 --> 4870.96
believing something as it is told to you

4868.08 --> 4873.199
is all you need to do because there were

4870.96 --> 4875.92
a couple of people

4873.199 --> 4877.12
that told you so and you believed him

4875.92 --> 4879.6
you believed

4877.12 --> 4881.84
something when man told you something

4879.6 --> 4881.84
yeah

4886.84 --> 4889.84
huh

4890.719 --> 4894.8
all of the world religion which one is

4893.679 --> 4896.719
the correct one

4894.8 --> 4899.12
none of them are correct they're all

4896.719 --> 4899.12
false

4899.199 --> 4905.678999999999
there is no world religion

4902.639 --> 4909.12
that is correct there's only things

4905.679 --> 4911.76
within the religions that are logos

4909.12 --> 4912.96
or there are no logos they serve a

4911.76 --> 4916.8
specific

4912.96 --> 4920.4
societal function within their choice

4916.8 --> 4921.76
good or bad and and that's what

4920.4 --> 4924.48
religions are

4921.76 --> 4925.280000000001
it it doesn't matter if you follow a

4924.48 --> 4929.28
religion

4925.28 --> 4932.4
you're wrong if you follow the religion

4929.28 --> 4935.44
but you realize what it is and you

4932.4 --> 4936.5599999999995
actually try to gain the understanding

4935.44 --> 4939.759999999999
and the inside and

4936.56 --> 4941.360000000001
figure it out the truth and you realize

4939.76 --> 4944.719
that lies and ignorance are

4941.36 --> 4947.759999999999
the devil then you're doing it

4944.719 --> 4948.56
good but not because you follow the

4947.76 --> 4951.4400000000005
religion

4948.56 --> 4951.76
whatever it is it's because you're doing

4951.44 --> 4956.839999999999
it

4951.76 --> 4959.84
right and that's the only correct

4956.84 --> 4959.84
religion

4969.12 --> 4974.719
that's right not only that clutch bear

4972.719 --> 4977.84
it's not that you don't need religion

4974.719 --> 4980.719
religion is a trap

4977.84 --> 4981.12
it's cookie cutter enlightenment and

4980.719 --> 4983.28
that's

4981.12 --> 4984.32
imp that's self-contradicting

4983.28 --> 4986.719
enlightenment is

4984.32 --> 4989.12
never cookie cutter it's always going to

4986.719 --> 4992.08
be a challenge a challenge from within

4989.12 --> 4993.04
a challenge from without that's the

4992.08 --> 4995.5199999999995
point

4993.04 --> 4996.96
the challenge is the point there is no

4995.52 --> 4999.76
cookie cutter

4996.96 --> 5001.04
thing to replace the real tough

4999.76 --> 5004.08
challenge

5001.04 --> 5005.679
that is the real thing and that's why

5004.08 --> 5008.239
religions

5005.679 --> 5008.719
tend to draw in people that actually

5008.239 --> 5010.718999999999
fail

5008.719 --> 5012.4800000000005
they just need to have an excuse to

5010.719 --> 5014.96
themselves and lie

5012.48 --> 5015.759999999999
the devil minor lie from the devil that

5014.96 --> 5018.32
tell them

5015.76 --> 5019.04
no this is the right thing you're doing

5018.32 --> 5022.719
by just

5019.04 --> 5025.44
following this bandwagon you don't need

5022.719 --> 5026.4800000000005
to attain the understanding you don't

5025.44 --> 5028.719
need to

5026.48 --> 5031.04
go further on that path and actually

5028.719 --> 5034.56
find the truth find god

5031.04 --> 5036.88
because if all these people around you

5034.56 --> 5038.320000000001
tell you you're doing good enough then

5036.88 --> 5043.84
that's good enough

5038.32 --> 5043.84
and that's what religion really is

5049.44 --> 5053.04
but if you don't need religion how do we

5052.08 --> 5055.28
know

5053.04 --> 5057.5199999999995
if we will be saved or not without any

5055.28 --> 5061.599999999999
guidance

5057.52 --> 5064.719
well you need to figure it out

5061.6 --> 5071.84
yeah that's the point you need to figure

5064.719 --> 5071.84
it out

5082.96 --> 5086.4
yeah you can [ __ ] off with your stupid

5085.44 --> 5088.879999999999
sock accounts

5086.4 --> 5091.759999999999

are

5099.76 --> 5105.12
get get an actual account name that

5102.88 --> 5106.32
actually reflects something and is not

5105.12 --> 5109.5199999999995

5106.32 --> 5113.04
stupid news trope

yeah i'm not really that triggered it's

5202.88 --> 5207.36
just that

5204.239 --> 5211.599999999999
there's nothing worse than like

5207.36 --> 5214.639
obviously like social engineering

5211.6 --> 5217.92

5214.639 --> 5221.04
cookie cutter flawless

5217.92 --> 5222.56

5225.92 --> 5230.88
hate it i want real people in my chat

5228.8 --> 5232.639
i'm having a very serious discussion

5230.88 --> 5235.1990000000005
right now about religion

5232.639 --> 5236.32
and the path of christ and confronting

5235.199 --> 5238.719
people with

5236.32 --> 5240.96
beliefs that they hold on to and it's

5238.719 --> 5243.44
been very good show

5240.96 --> 5246.0
there's nothing more than i hate and

5243.44 --> 5246.96
when stupid soccer counts with cookie

5246.0 --> 5251.76
cutter

5246.96 --> 5254.32
nonsense get in there you're not welcome

5251.76 --> 5255.12
piss off with your sick social

5254.32 --> 5267.84
engineering

5255.12 --> 5267.84
garbage get the [ __ ] out of my hangout

5274.4 --> 5278.4
if you want to be part of my hangout you

5276.4 --> 5280.719
want to actually thank me for anything

5278.4 --> 5284.159
i'm saying then make

5280.719 --> 5286.4800000000005
a real account that is actually you

5284.159 --> 5288.239
instead of hiding behind some disgusting

5286.48 --> 5291.678999999999
anonymity garbage

5288.239 --> 5297.12
and just show yourself stop

5291.679 --> 5297.12
hiding stop hiding behind this [ __ ]

5303.52 --> 5309.1990000000005
steamy traveler yeah i'm i don't really

5306.88 --> 5312.08
like gambling i think gambling is

5309.199 --> 5314.4
by definition just a parasitic industry

5312.08 --> 5314.4
really

5315.52 --> 5323.84
i don't care about lotteries

5333.12 --> 5337.92
no raziel that's a reification fallacy

5336.0 --> 5341.12
yeah religions they're not fake

5337.92 --> 5342.32
they're just a mistake holy books must

5341.12 --> 5346.159
be fake as well

5342.32 --> 5351.84
no it all depends on the wisdom

5346.159 --> 5351.839999999999
they contain

5352.8 --> 5357.52
what makes them real is the wisdom they

5355.52 --> 5359.360000000001
contain what you can learn out of it

5357.52 --> 5362.159000000001
how that cross-references with

5359.36 --> 5365.599999999999
everything that is where the wisdom lies

5362.159 --> 5369.44
right just because a religion

5365.6 --> 5372.08
is a framework for people to basically

5369.44 --> 5372.638999999999
not engage in the true ascension process

5372.08 --> 5375.44
the true

5372.639 --> 5376.2390000000005
understanding does it mean that the book

5375.44 --> 5379.44
they use

5376.239 --> 5382.879999999999
as a template for that process is

5379.44 --> 5385.28
fake that's not what it means at all

5382.88 --> 5386.0
it's just that that's what the people

5385.28 --> 5389.199
are doing

5386.0 --> 5389.84
with it and that could be considered a

5389.199 --> 5407.839999999999
dwelling

5389.84 --> 5407.84
a mistake that's the difference

5408.96 --> 5415.84
which book has the most wisdom

5412.32 --> 5415.84
well what do you mean quantity or

5418.84 --> 5423.28
quality

5420.08 --> 5425.84
there's vast quantities of wisdom in a

5423.28 --> 5429.12
lot of books

5425.84 --> 5429.12
i personally think that

5429.76 --> 5436.56
specifically jesus's words

5433.84 --> 5438.08
probably the highest quality of wisdom

5436.56 --> 5441.120000000001
and that's why they're so unique and

5438.08 --> 5445.76
they cannot be changed

5441.12 --> 5445.76
so yeah i'd go with the bible

5446.239 --> 5450.4
but that doesn't mean that other books

5449.04 --> 5450.719
are lesser because then you're going to

5450.4 --> 5453.759999999999
go

5450.719 --> 5455.92
into pecking order behavior esoterics

5453.76 --> 5458.4800000000005
are like oh let's approach this

5455.92 --> 5459.679
incredible interdimensional thing that's

5458.48 --> 5462.32
all about

5459.679 --> 5463.04
major understanding way beyond just the

5462.32 --> 5465.599999999999
normal

5463.04 --> 5466.96
thing yeah let's just treat it like it's

5465.6 --> 5468.2390000000005
a packing order thing let's

5466.96 --> 5470.0
just deal with it like a bunch of

5468.239 --> 5472.4
chickens yeah oh

5470.0 --> 5473.199
this is better than that yeah that

5472.4 --> 5475.36
that's

5473.199 --> 5476.48
i'm sure that's what ascension is all

5475.36 --> 5478.799999999999
about right that's

5476.48 --> 5480.08
attaining greater wisdom it's like no

5478.8 --> 5483.04
this is better than that

5480.08 --> 5484.159
you're bad yeah that's that's a sign of

5483.04 --> 5487.76
true wisdom

5484.159 --> 5489.679
yeah and i'm being sarcastic by the way

5487.76 --> 5491.679
yeah no i don't get caught up in

5489.679 --> 5505.84
exoteric nonsense like that

5491.679 --> 5505.84
i really don't

5508.639 --> 5512.159000000001
religion is just making you feel good

5510.8 --> 5513.84
about dying

5512.159 --> 5516.48
well that depends on what you're gonna

5513.84 --> 5520.719
do with the religion and what it's

5516.48 --> 5523.759999999999
playing into right yeah there is

5520.719 --> 5527.199
religions there are cults that do this

5523.76 --> 5530.88
right one of them is eugenics

5527.199 --> 5533.04
huh huh yeah the religion that's gonna

5530.88 --> 5535.04
make you feel good about dying

5533.04 --> 5536.88
because you're saving the planet yeah

5535.04 --> 5539.92
that's a religion too

5536.88 --> 5539.92
huh huh

5540.639 --> 5544.56
noticed anything about the people out

5543.36 --> 5548.5599999999995
there in the world

5544.56 --> 5561.84
yeah yeah it's a religion isn't it

5548.56 --> 5561.84
people do it they do it

5562.239 --> 5565.678999999999
people are sometimes scared of that no i

5564.32 --> 5568.0
think that pretty much everybody's

5565.679 --> 5568.96
scared of dying it's a it's a visceral

5568.0 --> 5571.84
mechanism

5568.96 --> 5571.84
in every person

5572.48 --> 5576.5599999999995
like people that are literally have no

5574.719 --> 5579.6
fear of death at all

5576.56 --> 5580.56
are considered broken because it's

5579.6 --> 5582.88
normal

5580.56 --> 5584.0
right now it depends on how strong those

5582.88 --> 5587.12
impulses are if

5584.0 --> 5590.56
you're gonna let that fear possess you

5587.12 --> 5592.5599999999995
constantly then yeah you're not dealing

5590.56 --> 5594.4800000000005
with it correctly

5592.56 --> 5595.84
i had a lot of fear of dying when i was

5594.48 --> 5599.36
younger a lot

5595.84 --> 5603.6
i was really afraid of it because i just

5599.36 --> 5606.32
couldn't imagine

5603.6 --> 5608.8
that existence would be like that right

5606.32 --> 5611.28
no matter what anybody said

5608.8 --> 5614.84
because i didn't have the oversight now

5611.28 --> 5617.84
i'm looking at the whole thing very

5614.84 --> 5617.84
differently

5629.12 --> 5634.08
word straight from god with a little g

5631.52 --> 5634.080000000001
razio

5638.48 --> 5644.48
right but to me i don't really care

5642.32 --> 5646.159
jesus's words are what matters the most

5644.48 --> 5649.759999999999
to me

5646.159 --> 5652.5599999999995
right and at it i might add some

5649.76 --> 5655.4400000000005
conspiracy nuttiness on top of that

5652.56 --> 5657.679
maybe the whole thing is fake it's just

5655.44 --> 5659.5199999999995
that jesus's words are the only real

5657.679 --> 5661.12
thing about it and he's actually been

5659.52 --> 5664.320000000001
extracted from another of

5661.12 --> 5666.159
other figures or something so like i

5664.32 --> 5669.199
would go as far as that

5666.159 --> 5670.08
to me it only matters only the words

5669.199 --> 5673.919999999999
matter

5670.08 --> 5676.32
only his words matter really

5673.92 --> 5676.32
to me

5678.8 --> 5682.0
i don't know man because look look who's

5681.36 --> 5685.679
been

5682.0 --> 5686.08
writing that bible look at those people

5685.679 --> 5688.4
what

5686.08 --> 5690.4
has happened to all of it over history

5688.4 --> 5692.879999999999
it's insane

5690.4 --> 5693.5199999999995
it's just guaranteed psychopaths in

5692.88 --> 5697.36
control

5693.52 --> 5700.56
all of the time all of the time

5697.36 --> 5703.759999999999
like oh really well the only thing that

5700.56 --> 5707.04
hasn't been changed are jesus's words so

5703.76 --> 5711.280000000001
whatever that entire thing is

5707.04 --> 5711.28
whatever it is made into

5712.639 --> 5716.88
there's something special about jesus's

5714.8 --> 5719.92
words it's the frequency

5716.88 --> 5722.159000000001
it's unique it's it has to be

5719.92 --> 5724.719
like that it cannot be changed so

5722.159 --> 5728.4
wherever it came from

5724.719 --> 5732.08
that thing is key is

5728.4 --> 5734.799999999999
ducky and i don't care

5732.08 --> 5735.36
what the bible really is underneath all

5734.8 --> 5737.679
that

5735.36 --> 5739.92
i don't care whether it was completely

5737.679 --> 5743.04
fabricated

5739.92 --> 5746.4800000000005
i don't care do you understand i don't

5743.04 --> 5747.119
care if it was fabricated or not i don't

5746.48 --> 5751.678999999999
care

5747.119 --> 5756.96
all i care for is the frequency

5751.679 --> 5760.0
and the words that are unaltered

5756.96 --> 5763.76
don't care where it came from all i

5760.0 --> 5771.84
care is what it is timeless

5763.76 --> 5771.84
timeless fantastical advice

5782.84 --> 5785.84
so

5796.84 --> 5799.84
so

5816.32 --> 5822.96
the [ __ ] ws god is nature

5819.679 --> 5826.8
no he's not god is the designer god

5822.96 --> 5830.159
is truth god designed nature

5826.8 --> 5833.4400000000005
nature is made by god

5830.159 --> 5836.5599999999995
it is not nature right people are made

5833.44 --> 5841.839999999999
by god that does not make people god

5836.56 --> 5841.84
either you're fundamentally incorrect

5880.84 --> 5886.56
so

5882.96 --> 5886.56
were you addressing clutch bear

5887.04 --> 5897.84
there's all kinds of people getting all

5890.56 --> 5897.84
frictionless in my chat kind of annoying

5914.48 --> 5921.759999999999
sorry but you're wrong you're provably

5918.239 --> 5924.718999999999
empirically wrong

5921.76 --> 5926.2390000000005
nature does not design itself you don't

5924.719 --> 5929.84
understand

5926.239 --> 5933.44
how it works there has to be a designer

5929.84 --> 5933.92
that's physically proven nature cannot

5933.44 --> 5936.08
design

5933.92 --> 5939.119
itself there is no proof that nature

5936.08 --> 5942.0
designs itself

5939.119 --> 5942.32
the evolution is fake it doesn't work at

5942.0 --> 5944.96
all

5942.32 --> 5946.639
not even close there's only adaptation

5944.96 --> 5950.08
even the very foundations

5946.639 --> 5953.1990000000005
of what make the building blocks prove

5950.08 --> 5954.639
there has to be a singular original

5953.199 --> 5958.32
designer that designed

5954.639 --> 5961.92
all of it throughout all time nature

5958.32 --> 5961.92
cannot design itself

5962.8 --> 5969.28
dude get

5966.0 --> 5969.28
out of here ass wipe

5977.119 --> 5983.679
how is god manifested

5980.719 --> 5986.4800000000005
what do you mean god manifested god is

5983.679 --> 5990.4
the designer he is outside of all things

5986.48 --> 5995.839999999999
he is all things considerably but only

5990.4 --> 5999.759999999999
as a whole

5995.84 --> 6003.28
god does not manifest the design

5999.76 --> 6009.84
is his manifestation he made it all he

6003.28 --> 6009.84
made it all to be

6014.159 --> 6023.839999999999
cha cha light shut up dude

6034.84 --> 6037.84
so

6056.56 --> 6062.639
well pat fee that's really cute

6059.84 --> 6063.04
that you believe that way but hey if you

6062.639 --> 6066.88
let

6063.04 --> 6068.0
nature tame you and just go with the

6066.88 --> 6069.4400000000005
flow

6068.0 --> 6071.04
yeah guess what's gonna happen you're

6069.44 --> 6074.48
not gonna ascend

6071.04 --> 6076.96
buddy yeah

6074.48 --> 6078.0
it's kind of like spiritual pacifism

6076.96 --> 6079.679
just follow nature

6078.0 --> 6082.88
oh really so you know what all the

6079.679 --> 6085.1990000000005
impulses that also come from nature

6082.88 --> 6086.8
that are not really good yeah you're

6085.199 --> 6088.4
just gonna follow them too because

6086.8 --> 6089.04
everything is okay because it's all

6088.4 --> 6090.96
natural

6089.04 --> 6093.6
because otherwise how could you come to

6090.96 --> 6107.84
it yeah great advice

6093.6 --> 6107.84
no not good advice at all

6109.6 --> 6113.92
the creator is perfect why he didn't

6112.719 --> 6116.4
create perfect things

6113.92 --> 6117.52
is the mystery well because there is no

6116.4 --> 6121.839999999999
point

6117.52 --> 6121.84
to creating perfect things

6122.239 --> 6128.32
the only perfection is the perfect

6125.36 --> 6128.32
imperfection

6129.6 --> 6149.84
because otherwise what is the point

6132.96 --> 6149.84
there is no point to perfection

6158.11 --> 6161.74
[Music]

6170.639 --> 6174.08
why go against something which will

6172.4 --> 6175.759999999999
happen regardless like that

6174.08 --> 6178.88
what do you mean why go against

6175.76 --> 6181.280000000001
something i'm not going against it

6178.88 --> 6183.04
it's just that hey if you're actually

6181.28 --> 6185.36
doing what you're supposed to be doing

6183.04 --> 6187.92
understanding figuring out finding true

6185.36 --> 6191.679
wisdom finding the path

6187.92 --> 6193.52
yeah then you gain a lot of fruit you're

6191.679 --> 6196.32
getting a lot of wisdom

6193.52 --> 6197.6
and then suddenly living longer not

6196.32 --> 6200.159
dying

6197.6 --> 6200.719
is very welcome it's very useful because

6200.159 --> 6203.599999999999
then you

6200.719 --> 6206.159
might attempt to let some of that

6203.6 --> 6209.52
insight in the teachings and the lessons

6206.159 --> 6211.92
rub off on the younger generations

6209.52 --> 6214.56
to give them a better example to look up

6211.92 --> 6217.6
towards so there is

6214.56 --> 6217.6
def it's worth

6217.679 --> 6232.88
to basically try to live longer if

6220.719 --> 6234.639
you're doing a good job

6232.88 --> 6237.76
all right not saying being scared of

6234.639 --> 6237.76
death is a good thing

6240.4 --> 6243.92
it's that's not even what i'm talk what

6242.56 --> 6244.56
i was talking about early what i was

6243.92 --> 6247.84
talking about

6244.56 --> 6251.52
is about the visceral

6247.84 --> 6254.400000000001
mechanism that's really not conscious

6251.52 --> 6254.719
that just makes you not want to die not

6254.4 --> 6258.159
just

6254.719 --> 6260.639
recklessly want to throw it away

6258.159 --> 6262.0
it's a it's a viscera it's a physical

6260.639 --> 6265.76
mechanism

6262.0 --> 6267.6
right that's also fear of death it's

6265.76 --> 6270.639
just the prevention mechanism

6267.6 --> 6275.84
right or dwelling upon it consciously

6270.639 --> 6275.84
yeah that's a that's a waste of time

6277.119 --> 6282.5599999999995
unless you want to engage some kind of

6280.4 --> 6284.719
challenge in which there is risk of

6282.56 --> 6287.6
death and then you want to puzzle it out

6284.719 --> 6290.08
how to kind of deal with it properly

6287.6 --> 6291.6
right but that's not necessarily being

6290.08 --> 6294.88
afraid of death it's just

6291.6 --> 6294.88
taking it into account

6297.44 --> 6301.119
what does god think about consuming

6299.6 --> 6304.320000000001
alcohol and drugs

6301.119 --> 6305.759999999999
uh it all depends

6304.32 --> 6308.0
what are you gonna do with it how are

6305.76 --> 6310.4800000000005
you gonna let it influence your life

6308.0 --> 6311.52
are you getting something out of it or

6310.48 --> 6313.36
is it actually

6311.52 --> 6316.4800000000005
holding you back in something that you

6313.36 --> 6318.239
shouldn't be holding back in right

6316.48 --> 6320.959999999999
what does god think about anger i don't

6318.239 --> 6325.199
think he thinks anything about anger

6320.96 --> 6327.679
anger is just another social mechanism

6325.199 --> 6328.239
and yeah if you're angry for a good

6327.679 --> 6331.04
reason

6328.239 --> 6332.159
it's just a sign it's something to to

6331.04 --> 6335.5199999999995
remind you like

6332.159 --> 6337.599999999999
yeah there is something that needs to be

6335.52 --> 6340.56
done

6337.6 --> 6341.1990000000005
if you let that anger get to you and let

6340.56 --> 6343.52
let it

6341.199 --> 6345.119
take grip of you and wreck your life

6343.52 --> 6345.6
yeah that's not you're not supposed to

6345.119 --> 6350.08
do that

6345.6 --> 6350.08
it's not effective most of the times

6350.96 --> 6355.76
right anger is there for a purpose it's

6353.44 --> 6359.199
a reminder

6355.76 --> 6359.52
it's not there just to actually act on

6359.199 --> 6361.599999999999
it

6359.52 --> 6364.8
like every time it arises that's never

6361.6 --> 6364.8
where what it was meant for

6364.88 --> 6373.52
right jesus was angry sometimes

6366.719 --> 6376.0
absolutely he was

6373.52 --> 6379.119000000001
like jesus flipping those tables was one

6376.0 --> 6379.119
of the best moments

6380.0 --> 6387.84
that that's when he was actually really

6382.4 --> 6387.839999999999
making an important stand

6398.639 --> 6402.400000000001
is hate good sometimes no

6403.36 --> 6406.639
hate is a waste of time

6410.239 --> 6416.718999999999
but hate is a natural reaction

6414.4 --> 6418.08
you can hate something because it hurts

6416.719 --> 6420.8
you

6418.08 --> 6423.28
something about it and then you should

6420.8 --> 6429.84
probably

6423.28 --> 6429.84
not approach you should go away from it

6441.36 --> 6445.5199999999995
that's a ridiculous thing to say in his

6443.6 --> 6449.6
presence

6445.52 --> 6453.6
like really so things god

6449.6 --> 6456.56
god right the creator did

6453.6 --> 6457.4400000000005
that means that anger is okay oh really

6456.56 --> 6461.1990000000005
so

6457.44 --> 6462.879999999999
that mighty over thing out there

6461.199 --> 6466.0
when he does something that means you

6462.88 --> 6469.28
can do it too oh really

6466.0 --> 6470.159
really you you think that you're

6469.28 --> 6474.96
supposed to do

6470.159 --> 6478.159
exactly like god does is that it

6474.96 --> 6480.56
huh no

6478.159 --> 6484.4
i don't think so i think there's

6480.56 --> 6499.119000000001
definitely separate rules for god

6484.4 --> 6502.32
and separate rules for mankind

6499.119 --> 6505.679
we must try and be like god no

6502.32 --> 6511.36
no wrong

6505.679 --> 6513.4400000000005
wrong wrong in his presence you're wrong

6511.36 --> 6516.32
no you have to do the right thing you

6513.44 --> 6519.44
have to follow jesus's example

6516.32 --> 6522.719
jesus is not god jesus is

6519.44 --> 6523.678999999999
jesus jesus channeled god i'm pretty

6522.719 --> 6526.719
sure he was

6523.679 --> 6528.8
unique in that aspect oh yes never never

6526.719 --> 6532.4
gonna take away from his uniqueness

6528.8 --> 6535.360000000001
oh yes right

6532.4 --> 6536.32
if you want to be like jesus okay that's

6535.36 --> 6540.0
closer

6536.32 --> 6543.199
god the creator the designer

6540.0 --> 6546.639
oh really you that's your example

6543.199 --> 6549.919999999999
yeah there's another group of people

6546.639 --> 6549.92
that also think like that

6552.84 --> 6558.0
huh

6554.08 --> 6558.0
let me remind you they're not christians

6565.599 --> 6569.599
hate is just an emotion nothing wrong

6567.36 --> 6572.239
with it oh really

6569.599 --> 6573.4400000000005
oh really you think that there's nothing

6572.239 --> 6576.718999999999
wrong with hatred

6573.44 --> 6579.199
really dwelling on hatred you know what

6576.719 --> 6582.32
that does to you iron 26

6579.199 --> 6584.32
it's really unhealthy really so if

6582.32 --> 6586.799999999999
things are really unhealthy and they

6584.32 --> 6590.639
basically wear on you

6586.8 --> 6590.639
you think that's not wrong

6591.679 --> 6594.4800000000005
i think it is

6594.96 --> 6611.84
it's literally in the design it has a

6598.0 --> 6611.84
negative influence

6617.44 --> 6622.0
are you a leading theologist in holland

6619.92 --> 6625.28
i don't know man

6622.0 --> 6626.88
dude i am nothing i'm nothing i'm just a

6625.28 --> 6632.0
freaking guy

6626.88 --> 6635.28
that's barely had a job in his life that

6632.0 --> 6637.84
considerably crazy to a lot of people

6635.28 --> 6639.759999999999
spirit journey stuff you consider me a

6637.84 --> 6641.52
shaman that might make me put it

6639.76 --> 6642.96
in a corner that kind of makes sense to

6641.52 --> 6645.4400000000005
you

6642.96 --> 6647.199
wizard perhaps i do like flat earth and

6645.44 --> 6648.48
cosmogeny and the mechanics and

6647.199 --> 6653.839999999999
structure

6648.48 --> 6653.839999999999
a lot theologist well

6653.92 --> 6660.719
i i'd like to consider dabbling in

6657.679 --> 6661.679
in some theology it's just that most of

6660.719 --> 6667.84
it

6661.679 --> 6667.84
is all exoteric dwelling to me

6667.92 --> 6672.96
so yeah as a theologist i'm not going to

6670.8 --> 6673.76
get any recognition anytime soon

6672.96 --> 6675.44
although

6673.76 --> 6677.119000000001
who knows man maybe there are people

6675.44 --> 6678.32
actually listening saying like yeah that

6677.119 --> 6681.36
makes a lot of sense

6678.32 --> 6683.92
does that make me a theologist

6681.36 --> 6683.92
i don't know

6689.92 --> 6693.679
some religions worship christ is that

6692.159 --> 6695.199
wrong that depends on how they're gonna

6693.679 --> 6697.52
do it

6695.199 --> 6700.48
steamy traveler that totally depends on

6697.52 --> 6700.4800000000005
how they're gonna do it

6701.679 --> 6709.119
look what is worshiping

6705.119 --> 6712.32
right what does that mean to worship

6709.119 --> 6712.88
does that mean follow the advice does

6712.32 --> 6717.04
that mean

6712.88 --> 6719.92
oh build momentums and and temples and

6717.04 --> 6720.88
places and a giant statue is that

6719.92 --> 6723.4400000000005
worshipping

6720.88 --> 6724.639
or is it oh let's slaughter everybody

6723.44 --> 6727.839999999999
that disagrees

6724.639 --> 6737.84
is that worship so how worship

6727.84 --> 6737.84
right how are they worshiping

6741.199 --> 6746.159
zeal you [ __ ] you want to get banned

6744.48 --> 6751.839999999999
after all this

6746.159 --> 6751.839999999999
you really do don't you

6761.199 --> 6779.839999999999
and how do you know i didn't read bible

6765.199 --> 6779.839999999999
how do you know that

6791.679 --> 6795.52
yeah mandy young it's been a very good

6793.84 --> 6798.8
show today

6795.52 --> 6798.8
it's really interesting stuff

6801.04 --> 6805.5199999999995
i'm gonna have to title it probably

6803.679 --> 6809.84
religion related

6805.52 --> 6809.84
christian related and then watch it back

6814.96 --> 6823.599
hello the ball what

6820.0 --> 6823.599
why are you calling yourself that

6829.28 --> 6833.36
all right jojo light yeah you did come

6831.28 --> 6834.5599999999995
on a little strong also you just made a

6833.36 --> 6837.839999999999
mistake look i

6834.56 --> 6841.1990000000005
really appreciate nature okay i do

6837.84 --> 6843.119000000001
i almost consider myself a druid i have

6841.199 --> 6846.32
a special connection to plants and

6843.119 --> 6848.88
animals a lot a lot

6846.32 --> 6850.799999999999
right i feel like i can get

6848.88 --> 6854.2390000000005
understanding with animals

6850.8 --> 6855.599
for real like really almost

6854.239 --> 6857.919999999999
telepathically

6855.599 --> 6858.96
okay so yeah i get it nature it's

6857.92 --> 6862.08
freaking awesome

6858.96 --> 6865.52
it's a lot less deluded than

6862.08 --> 6869.599
man mankind and women

6865.52 --> 6873.360000000001
right i get it that does not make

6869.599 --> 6876.639
god nature that's wrong it's just

6873.36 --> 6876.96
wrong and when you start to assume that

6876.639 --> 6881.119
you

6876.96 --> 6884.2390000000005
eventually run into ditches

6881.119 --> 6884.239
that make no sense

6889.119 --> 6894.88
do you think you followed the teachings

6890.96 --> 6894.88
of jesus well i certainly do my best

6895.199 --> 6899.919999999999
i do my best in many ways and failing in

6897.84 --> 6904.159000000001
certain ways i'm very well aware of that

6899.92 --> 6907.28
as well

6904.159 --> 6910.879999999999
but i do my best where i can and i

6907.28 --> 6913.28
don't accept the failure in ways i

6910.88 --> 6914.719
like i do keep in mind like i really

6913.28 --> 6917.199
really have to fix

6914.719 --> 6918.08
all these things like i'm never gonna

6917.199 --> 6921.199
give up

6918.08 --> 6922.48
on that i have to fix it i'm never gonna

6921.199 --> 6925.5199999999995
say no

6922.48 --> 6927.598999999999
i'm going to just pretend like it's not

6925.52 --> 6929.599
a mistake

6927.599 --> 6932.08
right that's the difference i'm not

6929.599 --> 6936.32
gonna pretend the things that i do wrong

6932.08 --> 6940.5599999999995
are not mistakes i do

6936.32 --> 6944.08
and i have the the self-punishing will

6940.56 --> 6946.639
to do it but it's very important

6944.08 --> 6947.28
you know why because it's important to

6946.639 --> 6950.719
know

6947.28 --> 6955.199
what is real and what is not and not

6950.719 --> 6958.32
let your desire for convenience

6955.199 --> 6959.598999999999
mental convenience dictate your reality

6958.32 --> 6962.88
but to always see

6959.599 --> 6963.76
reality exactly for what it is no matter

6962.88 --> 6966.2390000000005
how you

6963.76 --> 6967.4400000000005
want it in the moment and this is

6966.239 --> 6970.48
critical

6967.44 --> 6973.28
because the mind is way too flexible

6970.48 --> 6976.879999999999
and there's way too many things you can

6973.28 --> 6980.48
use out there to delude yourself

6976.88 --> 6982.719
so i try to prevent that

6980.48 --> 6984.638999999999
by just being honest about what am i

6982.719 --> 6986.719
doing wrong what is a minor mistake what

6984.639 --> 6988.4800000000005
is a major mistake

6986.719 --> 6990.08
am i going to talk about it or is it

6988.48 --> 6991.919999999999
only going to make things worse can i

6990.08 --> 6993.84
deal with it or do i have to put it on

6991.92 --> 6996.639
the long run

6993.84 --> 6998.0
what am i learning about engaging in the

6996.639 --> 7000.32
minor mistake

6998.0 --> 7001.76
because there's always signs like if you

7000.32 --> 7005.199
make a mistake

7001.76 --> 7008.159000000001
logos then there is

7005.199 --> 7012.5599999999995
the result the effect instantly from

7008.159 --> 7012.5599999999995
beginning to end there's a trajectory

7012.8 --> 7016.88
when you do something wrong or you do

7015.04 --> 7017.28
something right there's a trajectory

7016.88 --> 7020.56
i've

7017.28 --> 7021.04
learned to feel that out instantly that

7020.56 --> 7024.159000000001
i'd

7021.04 --> 7026.4
feel it when i make a mistake

7024.159 --> 7028.0
i feel it and i feel what the

7026.4 --> 7031.839999999999
consequences are gonna be

7028.0 --> 7035.28
fractal wise like on my mood on my

7031.84 --> 7036.4800000000005
social interaction i feel it it's very

7035.28 --> 7039.679
important to just

7036.48 --> 7041.36
know what is real and not to let

7039.679 --> 7045.92
yourself be led

7041.36 --> 7049.04
by temporary ideas of ideals

7045.92 --> 7050.639
that twist things and say no no but

7049.04 --> 7054.719
because of this and that

7050.639 --> 7056.96
it's not bad yeah it is it's always bad

7054.719 --> 7058.159
right does it mean that there's no place

7056.96 --> 7061.28
for it whatsoever

7058.159 --> 7065.119
because there is basically

7061.28 --> 7066.639
a necessity to engage in mistakes to

7065.119 --> 7069.119
learn about them it's also

7066.639 --> 7070.88
part of the design but that does not

7069.119 --> 7072.5599999999995
make the mistakes

7070.88 --> 7074.8
anything other than mistakes just

7072.56 --> 7076.88
because we're forced by the entire

7074.8 --> 7078.88
creation and set up to engage with these

7076.88 --> 7082.4800000000005
mistakes to fall for these mistakes

7078.88 --> 7083.679
doesn't justify the action it's still

7082.48 --> 7086.5599999999995
mistakes

7083.679 --> 7088.96
and that's a really key important lesson

7086.56 --> 7088.96
to me

7089.04 --> 7091.36
right

7094.48 --> 7098.879999999999
may i recommend you read the cabelli i

7096.719 --> 7101.36
the cabellian is the first video i

7098.88 --> 7102.96
uploaded on this channel jaja light i

7101.36 --> 7106.799999999999
have read it

7102.96 --> 7110.8
yeah and it's really interesting

7106.8 --> 7112.639
but doesn't mean it's perfect doesn't

7110.8 --> 7115.92
mean it's not

7112.639 --> 7117.28
like wrong in ways

7115.92 --> 7119.4400000000005
it's really interesting though it

7117.28 --> 7121.92
definitely

7119.44 --> 7122.799999999999
inspires looking deeper into the fractal

7121.92 --> 7126.84
nature of

7122.8 --> 7129.84
reality and at that it's very

7126.84 --> 7129.84
fascinating

7145.84 --> 7149.360000000001
yeah we can talk for days and this

7147.52 --> 7151.679
probably and hey i might bring it back

7149.36 --> 7153.92
up i have no objection it it seems to

7151.679 --> 7157.1990000000005
this subject seems to ins

7153.92 --> 7161.119
inspire a lot of people out here

7157.199 --> 7163.678999999999
right there's repair yeah it's probably

7161.119 --> 7166.48
there's a need for it right churches are

7163.679 --> 7167.92
not really providing

7166.48 --> 7170.08
and we're looking through the

7167.92 --> 7171.76
oversimplified versions of what they do

7170.08 --> 7174.8
i even discussed that today

7171.76 --> 7175.92
so yeah people still need an opportunity

7174.8 --> 7179.679
to reflect

7175.92 --> 7181.36
on these things to engage to engage in

7179.679 --> 7183.28
the growth in the wisdom and figuring

7181.36 --> 7186.159
out what are the mistakes

7183.28 --> 7186.96
how do you stop making the mistakes how

7186.159 --> 7189.04
do you end

7186.96 --> 7190.8
the mistakes figuring it out it's

7189.04 --> 7192.4
complicated it's always complicated and

7190.8 --> 7198.400000000001
there's always going to be

7192.4 --> 7202.48
bumping opinions and that's okay

7198.4 --> 7202.48
as long as we can prevent

7202.56 --> 7207.76
straw manning each other because that

7205.119 --> 7209.759999999999
never leads to anything

7207.76 --> 7211.52
right but i am gonna round out the show

7209.76 --> 7213.92

7211.52 --> 7215.119000000001

i don't mind either there's really

7267.599 --> 7271.360000000001
awesome globers that have supported me

and i totally appreciate that

7271.36 --> 7274.4
that gives me real respect because i

7274.0 --> 7277.92
know

7274.4 --> 7280.879999999999
how how difficult it is

7277.92 --> 7282.0
how polarizing it all is like a lot of

7280.88 --> 7285.92
flat earthers even

7282.0 --> 7288.32
have trouble complementing ballers

7285.92 --> 7290.08
because of the just the polarized setup

7288.32 --> 7292.48
of it all because of the standard

7290.08 --> 7294.48
psychological warfare engagement

7292.48 --> 7296.0
that will typically unroll it's very

7294.48 --> 7298.08
tough to help

7296.0 --> 7299.679
people on the other side and i really

7298.08 --> 7302.0
respect those that can

7299.679 --> 7304.719
and do that and do it properly and not

7302.0 --> 7306.56
just politically to suck up or anything

7304.719 --> 7308.0
i really appreciate those that can

7306.56 --> 7311.119000000001
support me that

7308.0 --> 7312.8
allow themselves to do that on the

7311.119 --> 7314.639
baller side but of course on the flat

7312.8 --> 7318.56
earth side as well

7314.639 --> 7321.599
right so i will be back tomorrow with

7318.56 --> 7324.88
flat earth early bird number 885

7321.599 --> 7326.159000000001
on the thursday edition and i'm going to

7324.88 --> 7328.719
join the flat earth debates which has

7326.159 --> 7332.159
already started up for a few minutes

7328.719 --> 7335.599
i hope to see you there hashtag mifa
