8.95 --> 40.229
[Music]

40.35 --> 49.69
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

44.379 --> 52.36
early-bird number 183 I'm your host

49.69 --> 54.43
Arwen and before we start the show

52.36 --> 57.489
please don't forget to share it on any

54.43 --> 58.96
platform you deem fit and also if you

57.489 --> 60.909
haven't already subscribed to my channel

58.96 --> 62.35
and hit the bell notification so you

60.909 --> 66.929
know when I'm going life which is

62.35 --> 71.7
normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time so today

66.929 --> 75.22
it's very similar to yesterday man like

71.7 --> 80.229
chemtrails everywhere still nice and

75.22 --> 86.02
sunny still kind of windy and yeah just

80.229 --> 89.89
take a look this it's reading out yeah

86.02 --> 94.99
yesterday on the debates also took a

89.89 --> 97.69
long shot of chemtrails literally being

94.99 --> 101.53
sprayed like a checkerboard right above

97.69 --> 105.91
me and yeah they pretty much did that

101.53 --> 108.36
again today hope they stop doing that so

105.91 --> 114.0
frequently it's really annoying and I

108.36 --> 118.39
can literally feel it to my skin outside

114.0 --> 120.069
especially in the evening it's like it

118.39 --> 126.97
gets a little bit more agitated than

120.069 --> 129.179
usual hmm so let's see who's in chat so

126.97 --> 133.44
far

129.179 --> 137.879
HM was there very early good morning

133.44 --> 144.22
x3 20 over moco a Rambo Jambo

137.879 --> 147.69
yeah well X 320 I got a regular car song

144.22 --> 151.05
today and of course tea no coffee

147.69 --> 154.989
because I actually decided to go for it

151.05 --> 157.39000000000001
yesterday I just got really curious and

154.989 --> 161.51
I thought okay I'm gonna I'm gonna

157.39 --> 165.32999999999998
really try that now so yeah

161.51 --> 169.2
rainforest I tried started on an advice

165.33 --> 172.32000000000002
I got from Rasta Hat who has been taking

169.2 --> 175.67
it or I had had taken it a while ago and

172.32 --> 180.9
he said it had long lasting effects and

175.67 --> 182.97
it's interesting I actually don't take

180.9 --> 186.8
like the entire capsule which is pretty

182.97 --> 186.8
big yeah it's no longer sealed now

188.99 --> 196.86
they're pretty big it's a big pill but

194.28 --> 200.76
the funny thing is yeah you can eat

196.86 --> 203.70000000000002
easily open them up well it's not

200.76 --> 207.42
working now anyway you can just put get

203.7 --> 210.76999999999998
it off and then put it in the orange

207.42 --> 215.30999999999997
juice so I did that I already took a

210.77 --> 219.03
pretty big sip out of it two fifths one

215.31 --> 225.69
kill and yeah yesterday I already did

219.03 --> 227.94
that even slower I don't know when you

225.69 --> 231.39
take very little I'd I don't notice that

227.94 --> 234.51
much but there was a slight tendency to

231.39 --> 237.42
just naturally be able to focus on

234.51 --> 238.07999999999998
things better just a little so it wasn't

237.42 --> 241.98
interesting

238.08 --> 246.92000000000002
it didn't feel any big things

241.98 --> 250.07999999999998
it was very subtle so yeah

246.92 --> 256.40999999999997
it's interesting so cheers guys gonna

250.08 --> 258.479
take the rest of it Hey

256.41 --> 260.459
I don't know it smells kind of funny but

258.479 --> 263.96999999999997
when you dissolve it in organic orange

260.459 --> 270.83
juice I really don't taste the

263.97 --> 270.83000000000004
difference even it's just orange juice

274.1 --> 279.36
maybe it's slightly more better because

276.99 --> 286.639
of it but it's just so subtle can barely

279.36 --> 286.639
tell the difference taste wise so yeah

287.04 --> 290.279
[Music]

292.53 --> 302.90999999999997
taken down a little no that's not

295.57 --> 305.44
ayahuasca ass that was brain force plus

302.91 --> 310.57000000000005
basically an entire capsule and you're

305.44 --> 315.96999999999997
supposed to take two I'm not a big guy

310.57 --> 318.49
so I'm not gonna take two and I don't

315.97 --> 322.78000000000003
want kind of rush I don't want to be

318.49 --> 325.56
pushed that hard in my in my mind I want

322.78 --> 328.75
to be careful with that stuff

325.56 --> 331.45
also because yeah technically I am kind

328.75 --> 335.85
of combining it with cannabis so don't

331.45 --> 340.63
wanna push both things too hard I think

335.85 --> 342.76000000000005
if you just don't drink and don't don't

340.63 --> 345.01
smoke cannabis or anything you could

342.76 --> 346.96
just probably take these to have the

345.01 --> 351.73
full effect and no side effect because

346.96 --> 353.5
of it at all I don't know maybe you can

351.73 --> 361.5
even combine it there's probably people

353.5 --> 364.15
out there that do that but you know it's

361.5 --> 366.48
nothing specifically warning about that

364.15 --> 366.47999999999996
but

385.93 --> 391.199
yeah I kind of do feel something

395.71 --> 405.07
yeah it simply hats it really does seems

398.77 --> 410.04999999999995
to be a focus and the answer mostly so I

405.07 --> 413.11
guess I want be is easily distracted as

410.05 --> 415.18
usual anyway and more people in chat and

413.11 --> 416.949
Robert gets if it's five artists labor

415.18 --> 421.53000000000003
Alex good morning or good afternoon

416.949 --> 421.53000000000003
press through this truth

425.719 --> 434.509
okay Rambo Jambo yeah you should be

433.789 --> 437.449
afraid

434.509 --> 441.139
oh and unless you really know these

437.449 --> 444.79900000000004
people you should never just go

441.139 --> 447.259
somewhere and and try it out like any

444.799 --> 450.799
event no you should definitely get to

447.259 --> 452.569
know the people that you're that you're

450.799 --> 455.32899999999995
gonna be doing it with it's very

452.569 --> 457.159
important and if it doesn't feel right

455.329 --> 459.139
they you should definitely not go but

457.159 --> 464.259
before you even consider it you need to

459.139 --> 464.259
know these people so that's my advice

473.15 --> 479.28999999999996
Oh righteous force no I haven't seen any

476.87 --> 479.29
debates

483.5 --> 488.78
my volume oh right I completely forgot

486.83 --> 492.25
about that that was so annoying yeah

488.78 --> 498.67999999999995
that was actually Riley that made me say

492.25 --> 506.33
should put my volume down let me put it

498.68 --> 512.15
back up okay how's this should probably

506.33 --> 514.9689999999999
be better right should just put it

512.15 --> 525.669
straight to 150 it wasn't 120 now it's

514.969 --> 525.6690000000001
140 just go straight to 150

528.71 --> 534.649
okay well thanks for notifying me I

532.64 --> 536.87
completely forgot that I bought to

534.649 --> 539.089
follow him down yes they already kind of

536.87 --> 543.23
noticed like hmm sounds kinda low had to

539.089 --> 545.6
put up my volume I I think it was to to

543.23 --> 556.5500000000001
even out the volume with with Jessica

545.6 --> 560.0600000000001
yeah that was it right

556.55 --> 562.43
well Voynich and most are witch doctors

560.06 --> 564.89
look at witch doctor doesn't necessarily

562.43 --> 572.18
have to be evil they can just be a

564.89 --> 574.61
shaman and those are kind of neutral you

572.18 --> 579.04
have to really size them you as I said

574.61 --> 579.04
you have to get to know them for real

580.54 --> 587.75
you have to really get them and not just

584.779 --> 593.63
be caught up in kind of like a formal

587.75 --> 595.91
act that they have which many do have

593.63 --> 597.41
like if they're professional at it that

595.91 --> 600.65
they say if they're selling their

597.41 --> 603.35
services they will have usually tend to

600.65 --> 606.65
have kind of like an act and you really

603.35 --> 610.39
have to be go beyond that really if

606.65 --> 610.39
you're wannabes if you want to be safe

622.62 --> 629.74
hmm right bandit band saw band band saw

628.42 --> 631.8399999999999
bandit right

629.74 --> 635.95
do you believe you need to tap into

631.84 --> 641.71
drugs to tap into your inner self no of

635.95 --> 644.0200000000001
course not unless you're like so

641.71 --> 647.5300000000001
neurotically incapable of doing it by

644.02 --> 653.77
yourself that you have to use drugs to

647.53 --> 656.49
basically force you to do it that can be

653.77 --> 661.84
some people it's still hard-headed

656.49 --> 665.98
it forces them hmm but you definitely

661.84 --> 671.5
don't need that technically even Alex

665.98 --> 675.76
Jones even talked about this these the

671.5 --> 680.4
DMT chemical is in your brain it is

675.76 --> 685.39
there especially when you're young and

680.4 --> 688.27
sometimes with some people more than the

685.39 --> 691.81
average I'm absolutely certain I'm one

688.27 --> 694.8
of those people because I naturally had

691.81 --> 694.8
these experiences

698.16 --> 704.98
and in retrospect in my dark world

701.59 --> 707.5300000000001
visions every time it was like a symbol

704.98 --> 712.44
like I would be getting the juice again

707.53 --> 717.97
that's the higher gestured ayahuasca but

712.44 --> 721.8100000000001
often it is so weird because time is not

717.97 --> 724.09
the same with these experiences so when

721.81 --> 726.9399999999999
I was very young in these experiences I

724.09 --> 728.74
would be bigger and older that was one

726.94 --> 732.1
of the most appealing things about it's

728.74 --> 734.17
like oh my god I am finally my true self

732.1 --> 738.3100000000001
kind of thing so that made me long for

734.17 --> 744.28
it now later it's pretty much stuck in

738.31 --> 747.25
that format so I don't have really a

744.28 --> 752.14
longing because it's yeah it's that I

747.25 --> 757.08
know what it is I've passed that phase

752.14 --> 757.08
in the three-dimensional world basically

758.78 --> 761.909
[Music]

762.39 --> 779.88
but yeah the the DMT experience can be

767.13 --> 779.88
experienced naturally lonathan in Chet

782.779 --> 788.959
really taboo conspiracy says you can

785.54 --> 791.199
marry your cousin fine that's what you

788.959 --> 791.199
want

801.42 --> 808.8
like I wouldn't try to take the stigmata

805.29 --> 812.0999999999999
away because technically marrying your

808.8 --> 817.29
own family is kind of yeah it's at least

812.1 --> 820.9200000000001
if you want to breed it's genetically

817.29 --> 823.9699999999999
dubious but to specifically forbid it

820.92 --> 827.9399999999999
I don't see the really the point at it

823.97 --> 832.86
you know but I guess that's a liberal

827.94 --> 836.3100000000001
thing from my side you know as long as

832.86 --> 837.42
you're not really bothering other people

836.31 --> 843.8589999999999
with it

837.42 --> 843.8589999999999
[Music]

850.14 --> 859.47
well just see it like this I guess not

854.07 --> 863.61
actually trying to argue for it but a if

859.47 --> 868.35
gay people can marry then why couldn't

863.61 --> 870.149
you marry your cousin you know it all

868.35 --> 873.98
depends on your view what marriage is

870.149 --> 878.1
really about and if you're very

873.98 --> 879.57
old-style like it is a family unit to

878.1 --> 881.4590000000001
make kids if you're gonna approach it

879.57 --> 883.35
from that angle while then marrying gay

881.459 --> 883.89
kind of doesn't really make any sense

883.35 --> 887.519
either

883.89 --> 889.9499999999999
and then yeah of course marrying your

887.519 --> 893.04
cousin is like for breeding especially

889.95 --> 896.7
not really wanted so then good argue

893.04 --> 899.8499999999999
okay maybe not so at all it all depends

896.7 --> 908.19
on your view on it on how that's

899.85 --> 911.269
supposed to be for me look marriage real

908.19 --> 917.24
marriage is a personal spiritual bond

911.269 --> 920.3100000000001
it's unmistakable if it's real and the

917.24 --> 923.699
societal marriage is basically an

920.31 --> 926.67
institute it's more technical it's

923.699 --> 931.16
actually even more financially technical

926.67 --> 931.16
in the Western world so

935.58 --> 940.5300000000001
yeah a lot of people in the Netherlands

938.01 --> 948.09
at least they get kids without getting

940.53 --> 953.13
married lots of them we got a lot of

948.09 --> 956.48
bastards here as they say but yeah

953.13 --> 956.48
nobody really cares about that

964.56 --> 975.4699999999999
[Music]

966.62 --> 982.37
hmm a penis clerk yeah doing good

975.47 --> 982.37
I'm trying that brain force it's okay

983.09 --> 990.89
now maybe if I like took two doses just

988.38 --> 995.37
then it would be pretty heavy experience

990.89 --> 999.12
and now it's like yeah this is pretty it

995.37 --> 1010.22
does kind of help a little helps focus a

999.12 --> 1015.91
little it evens out a sensory chaos a

1010.22 --> 1015.9100000000001
little that's nice

1022.649 --> 1025.649
Hey

1037.569 --> 1044.48
random explore I don't think marriage is

1040.01 --> 1048.47
a useless concept but since governments

1044.48 --> 1052.73
are turning towards more bureaucracy and

1048.47 --> 1055.04
autocracy tendencies that actually

1052.73 --> 1056.9
endangers marriage because marriage is

1055.04 --> 1061.6599999999999
an institute that is basically derived

1056.9 --> 1065.27
from government always has been and

1061.66 --> 1068.66
they're not exactly helping out a lot of

1065.27 --> 1072.91
them the globalists as they say don't

1068.66 --> 1072.91
are not really helping out families

1082.16 --> 1086.39
and at least in the western countries

1090.32 --> 1095.6299999999999
but I don't think marriage is a useless

1092.79 --> 1095.6299999999999
Institute

1101.6 --> 1108.6999999999998
it's just it big it's becoming a little

1105.61 --> 1113.4499999999998
superfluous with everything with how the

1108.7 --> 1116.27
dynamics of social interactions have

1113.45 --> 1118.93
changed so it makes it a little

1116.27 --> 1121.93
superfluous in that sense old-fashioned

1118.93 --> 1121.93
but

1134.92 --> 1140.5700000000002
look it all depends on your view of it

1137.81 --> 1143.3899999999999
it is like with diamond rings although

1140.57 --> 1145.4299999999998
that's much it's worse with that so like

1143.39 --> 1147.5300000000002
oh do you really like it well then you

1145.43 --> 1150.26
might find the price worth it and you'll

1147.53 --> 1153.41
probably be able to trade it for that

1150.26 --> 1156.59
price again so why not and if you like

1153.41 --> 1161.0
that do you'll do it well and there is

1156.59 --> 1165.08
still a lot of women at least with

1161.0 --> 1167.18
marriage dreams I think maybe probably

1165.08 --> 1169.22
not as much as it used to be it's not

1167.18 --> 1173.3600000000001
being promoted as much anymore because

1169.22 --> 1180.8
media promotion cultural promotion does

1173.36 --> 1185.2099999999998
really strengthen the dream with girls

1180.8 --> 1187.82
and everything toys and they are kind of

1185.21 --> 1190.01
stepping away from it so there will be

1187.82 --> 1192.61
less women with dreams of marriage

1190.01 --> 1192.61
because of that

1197.13 --> 1203.73
women with marriage dreams do often also

1200.07 --> 1213.87
have children dreams usually tied in and

1203.73 --> 1216.419
I do agree that yeah in order for us as

1213.87 --> 1219.5
a species to survive we really need to

1216.419 --> 1223.6200000000001
keep the tradition of basically breeding

1219.5 --> 1225.48
somehow keep it going because if

1223.62 --> 1230.4899999999998
nobody's motivated to do it anymore

1225.48 --> 1232.53
because it's being demotivated then yeah

1230.49 --> 1236.1
eventually we will end up with a whole

1232.53 --> 1239.37
bunch of people that might be able to do

1236.1 --> 1244.1999999999998
almost anything they like or at least a

1239.37 --> 1248.52
lot but they'll start yeah they'll all

1244.2 --> 1254.039
be missing out on certain things that

1248.52 --> 1255.99
their instincts actually want and it

1254.039 --> 1258.33
will not do society any good it would

1255.99 --> 1261.6
highly demoralize the situation because

1258.33 --> 1269.72
could eventually cause pretty sudden

1261.6 --> 1272.6689999999999
chaos because of yeah ongoing

1269.72 --> 1275.34
non-decreasing demoralization that just

1272.669 --> 1278.94
builds up eventually there's not any

1275.34 --> 1282.059
sounds of children around that has a

1278.94 --> 1286.0700000000002
long lasting echoing effect of

1282.059 --> 1286.07
psychology of an entire society

1288.65 --> 1294.47
yeah society and the psychology of

1292.309 --> 1299.66
humans and everything how it all works

1294.47 --> 1302.059
it's really complicated it's it's basic

1299.66 --> 1305.78
mechanisms but how it all works together

1302.059 --> 1309.7
is pretty damn elaborate and complicated

1305.78 --> 1309.7
so that's what I'm trying to say

1325.53 --> 1334.3
alright truth is truth well look

1331.2 --> 1338.5900000000001
diamonds there is something beautiful

1334.3 --> 1341.1399999999999
about them it it's a special art look at

1338.59 --> 1344.53
the way they carve it it has a unique

1341.14 --> 1348.0700000000002
refractive capability and it can be kind

1344.53 --> 1350.68
of emulated with a fake diamond brand

1348.07 --> 1352.98
which is also very elaborate it's still

1350.68 --> 1358.45
not the same real as a real diamond and

1352.98 --> 1361.15
diamonds are absurdly tough they're so

1358.45 --> 1364.42
hard it's a pretty unique material type

1361.15 --> 1366.16
so although it's not as rare as they

1364.42 --> 1371.3700000000001
portray it to be it can even be

1366.16 --> 1371.3700000000001
artificially made on a pretty big scale

1372.0 --> 1376.95
if they need to they wouldn't want to

1382.669 --> 1387.019
the the Omega where T

1393.1 --> 1401.519
right yeah that's you got the gist of it

1395.95 --> 1403.99
when I was saying it all sounds so

1401.519 --> 1408.46
right-wing like oh you're supposed to do

1403.99 --> 1412.57
that but there is the logos a factor the

1408.46 --> 1416.799
natural instincts that need to be

1412.57 --> 1418.84
fulfilled or there will be a gap in the

1416.799 --> 1422.259
psychological development it's just the

1418.84 --> 1424.6299999999999
reality although there are some

1422.259 --> 1429.519
exceptions but in general that is a

1424.63 --> 1432.8200000000002
reality the biological reality it's not

1429.519 --> 1435.49
like I don't want women to actually feel

1432.82 --> 1438.7
very special and capable you know like I

1435.49 --> 1440.2
love it when they enjoy themselves when

1438.7 --> 1443.6490000000001
they're actually good at it and not just

1440.2 --> 1446.919
arrogant [ __ ] because that's really

1443.649 --> 1449.32
annoying but yeah that's glorious to see

1446.919 --> 1452.95
a woman really doing something awesome I

1449.32 --> 1459.539
like capable women characters in movies

1452.95 --> 1465.1000000000001
and series as well you know that's cool

1459.539 --> 1470.4089999999999
but you shouldn't then discourage them

1465.1 --> 1473.49
at the same time from also making a

1470.409 --> 1473.49
family at some point

1474.14 --> 1479.21
you know that that should be like

1476.39 --> 1481.76
reminded like yeah look this is also

1479.21 --> 1484.04
kind of important even though it's very

1481.76 --> 1489.16
contrasting with what you've been doing

1484.04 --> 1489.1599999999999
so far you can't just ignore it

1492.1 --> 1498.98
anyway that's probably a lot of women

1495.799 --> 1501.41
that kind of do know it you can't get

1498.98 --> 1506.179
away from that instinctual realization

1501.41 --> 1509.5700000000002
really but yeah that just that it's

1506.179 --> 1513.679
being discouraged Society through media

1509.57 --> 1517.51
and through to cultural outlets like

1513.679 --> 1517.51
Hollywood and that's just terrible

1525.39 --> 1529.21
right for an itch

1527.17 --> 1530.5
yeah I've come pretty much to the same

1529.21 --> 1533.41
conclusion it's weird

1530.5 --> 1537.99
it's an instinct thing it's like a woman

1533.41 --> 1541.69
and I don't know this from reality okay

1537.99 --> 1543.76
unfortunately but I've I do have two

1541.69 --> 1546.79
centuries and I do pick it up with other

1543.76 --> 1549.27
people and it's like when a woman just

1546.79 --> 1552.43
finds a man they can suddenly just

1549.27 --> 1553.93
decide like yeah I want to chat with you

1552.43 --> 1560.74
and then suddenly energetically

1553.93 --> 1565.03
everything changes it's it's pretty

1560.74 --> 1567.79
astounding to behold but the women I

1565.03 --> 1570.1499999999999
think do decide if this is going to

1567.79 --> 1570.1499999999999
happen

1583.24 --> 1598.57
all right well vine each yes big gays

1591.07 --> 1602.4089999999999
you're always so subtle but as our own

1598.57 --> 1606.039
Benjamin says yeah that the gays just

1602.409 --> 1612.6000000000001
won a lot of sodomy and they and they're

1606.039 --> 1618.07
just opposing anything that would

1612.6 --> 1620.529
criticize them about it pretty much like

1618.07 --> 1621.399
if you don't think that is just the best

1620.529 --> 1623.89
thing ever

1621.399 --> 1632.07
then they'll start eventually to attack

1623.89 --> 1632.0700000000002
you that and yeah that's really true

1649.31 --> 1657.35
well this functional it's not literally

1653.09 --> 1661.58
like all gays okay it is mostly gay

1657.35 --> 1665.1399999999999
activist groups and yeah the social

1661.58 --> 1668.4499999999998
justice warrior the transsexual that

1665.14 --> 1671.9
that group of people that have kind of

1668.45 --> 1675.23
allied though not everybody agrees that

1671.9 --> 1677.51
of course that you're in that category

1675.23 --> 1681.14
but there's just this ban of people and

1677.51 --> 1685.37
they are just meddling politically with

1681.14 --> 1687.41
everything manipulating media

1685.37 --> 1695.1799999999998
manipulating Institute's like schools

1687.41 --> 1697.7
and companies even politicians

1695.18 --> 1702.14
themselves they they're just meddling

1697.7 --> 1707.02
with everything and yeah it is a lot of

1702.14 --> 1711.41
gay people in there that's really true

1707.02 --> 1713.9
it's just statistical because it's part

1711.41 --> 1716.45
of their thing it's like you have to be

1713.9 --> 1721.64
it almost like otherwise you're not on

1716.45 --> 1724.04
the same liberal level as it is very

1721.64 --> 1733.8500000000001
weird how it will work so the weird

1724.04 --> 1737.3
crazy basically identity politics based

1733.85 --> 1740.54
social hierarchy that's really a thing

1737.3 --> 1744.29
it's crazy and there's just people that

1740.54 --> 1747.17
really take that on it's insane

1744.29 --> 1749.8
yeah I can see you Brandon cook don't

1747.17 --> 1749.8000000000002
worry about it

1757.45 --> 1763.63
that ran slender I like that bill G that

1760.97 --> 1763.63
is awesome

1774.96 --> 1782.7
right well dysfunctional the thing is

1779.57 --> 1785.9299999999998
originally liberals like say they up

1782.7 --> 1790.46
until the 90s even they would actually

1785.93 --> 1790.46
speak for others they would test

1790.88 --> 1796.8500000000001
everyone even do like what is it

1799.1 --> 1808.4299999999998
analysis petitions and in that kind of

1805.83 --> 1812.58
there was a lot of petitions from left

1808.43 --> 1814.3500000000001
to basically size up okay how what are

1812.58 --> 1816.81
the issues what do people think that are

1814.35 --> 1819.12
the issues and then they take a subject

1816.81 --> 1820.8899999999999
that this covers as wide as much and

1819.12 --> 1824.31
then they defend it and the people kind

1820.89 --> 1827.0300000000002
of appreciate that that that is

1824.31 --> 1831.27
originally HUD liberals did it but now

1827.03 --> 1834.69
they don't really do that anymore and

1831.27 --> 1836.58
they just go overkill they just take

1834.69 --> 1840.3
something that is really extreme that

1836.58 --> 1843.21
nobody really wants that is just too

1840.3 --> 1848.49
liberal and then they peer pressure

1843.21 --> 1850.65
everyone like if you don't think that

1848.49 --> 1852.75
this is good then you're a conservative

1850.65 --> 1855.89
basically you're with us or you're with

1852.75 --> 1858.75
again you're against us with this new

1855.89 --> 1866.0700000000002
rule of how things are supposed to be

1858.75 --> 1867.9
it's a total mind warfare system it's

1866.07 --> 1870.24
nothing like the Liberals where it's

1867.9 --> 1872.5500000000002
totally flipped around it's it's

1870.24 --> 1875.25
literally like corrupted almost like

1872.55 --> 1881.01
transformed from a regular person into a

1875.25 --> 1883.61
giant vampire symbolically it's just

1881.01 --> 1888.12
totally corrupted everything is wrong it

1883.61 --> 1892.8899999999999
Marxist it marcsa fied it went

1888.12 --> 1895.77
autocratic and aggressive and and just

1892.89 --> 1899.8400000000001
total shameless lying beyond anything it

1895.77 --> 1902.61
wasn't just lying anymore to cover up

1899.84 --> 1904.8899999999999
dubious things about people in the party

1902.61 --> 1906.24
which has been going on forever in

1904.89 --> 1908.46
politics of course but liberals

1906.24 --> 1908.88
especially because there are always have

1908.46 --> 1912.0
been

1908.88 --> 1915.2700000000002
very dubious people in there but just

1912.0 --> 1920.1
the narrative itself just a total full

1915.27 --> 1924.45
in mind [ __ ] it's a total lie it is an

1920.1 --> 1934.4599999999998
attempt at corruption of common sense

1924.45 --> 1934.46
reality itself a war on mind on culture

1934.85 --> 1940.8899999999999
unconsciousness and that's what the

1938.34 --> 1942.6599999999999
Liberals now what they've become what

1940.89 --> 1944.7
they've mutated into that's what they're

1942.66 --> 1947.7
doing and it's nothing like the original

1944.7 --> 1955.6200000000001
liberals and I reject what it has become

1947.7 --> 1958.3700000000001
utterly so just a terrible terrible

1955.62 --> 1958.37
disappointment

1971.73 --> 1978.059
so yeah what they've become is nothing

1974.549 --> 1981.96
like what they were and it's all turned

1978.059 --> 1987.69
to [ __ ] and as I've been saying even

1981.96 --> 1991.019
before 82 in looking into the deep we

1987.69 --> 1995.25
have to replace the left to get it back

1991.019 --> 1998.13
the way it was unravel this monolithic

1995.25 --> 2007.88
corruption this top-down corruption

1998.13 --> 2014.71
that's just yeah it's like a coupe on

2007.88 --> 2014.71
the entire party by the inner members

2016.779 --> 2022.549
used to be good it kind of the Dark

2020.149 --> 2027.9499999999998
One's got in there and then they just

2022.549 --> 2031.49
said okay off with the with the mask our

2027.95 --> 2033.32
masks and we're in control and this is

2031.49 --> 2037.13
how it's gonna go now and we're gonna

2033.32 --> 2042.4399999999998
take over the world almost straight

2037.13 --> 2044.96
forward it's crazy

2042.44 --> 2048.05
so it should be stopped in my opinion

2044.96 --> 2051.8
and I hate that it's reached so wide

2048.05 --> 2053.8700000000003
that like it in the media around the

2051.8 --> 2059.63
world there's just so many groups that

2053.87 --> 2066.74
just are part of this insane mad driven

2059.63 --> 2069.31
cult that the left has become it's

2066.74 --> 2069.31
terrible

2074.04 --> 2086.159
you know let let's get back to defending

2079.95 --> 2092.48
the individual and truly keeping lasting

2086.159 --> 2096.44
peace and be you met a human

2092.48 --> 2098.82
humanitarian for everyone equally

2096.44 --> 2101.82
absolutely everyone equally and don't

2098.82 --> 2103.9700000000003
force equalization don't force home come

2101.82 --> 2103.9700000000003
on

2108.82 --> 2115.0800000000004
ha monetization just that it all becomes

2113.44 --> 2118.9900000000002
uniform don't do that

2115.08 --> 2121.84
let let it remain actually liberal and

2118.99 --> 2127.75
let everybody be whatever they want to

2121.84 --> 2129.4900000000002
be be liberal fine and make regular

2127.75 --> 2133.45
conditions better starting of course

2129.49 --> 2137.91
with yourself with your own country not

2133.45 --> 2142.66
necessarily the individual in politics

2137.91 --> 2146.16
but do good for the country and then the

2142.66 --> 2148.7799999999997
country does good then move on and

2146.16 --> 2149.6499999999996
suggest improve the world that's how

2148.78 --> 2151.6600000000003
it's supposed to be

2149.65 --> 2153.4300000000003
that's nothing what they're doing right

2151.66 --> 2156.19
now it's only just though communism more

2153.43 --> 2157.06
taxes or just get control over

2156.19 --> 2164.25
everything

2157.06 --> 2170.47
there the liberal parties become

2164.25 --> 2173.62
political you say mercenaries political

2170.47 --> 2177.5499999999997
mercenaries for the oligarchy that's

2173.62 --> 2179.56
what they're now doing they're not truly

2177.55 --> 2181.42
political parties in the interest of

2179.56 --> 2182.95
their countries no they don't give a

2181.42 --> 2185.41
[ __ ] really about their countries they

2182.95 --> 2188.0499999999997
just give you [ __ ] about the globalism

2185.41 --> 2190.6299999999997
and about the the oligarchy and the

2188.05 --> 2195.04
technocracy that guides it basically and

2190.63 --> 2202.06
the plan that crazy crazy New World

2195.04 --> 2206.97
Order plan so yeah that's my take on it

2202.06 --> 2206.97
that long wine if I'm gonna eat a castle

2218.51 --> 2233.119
and that's not true dysfunctional modern

2228.76 --> 2234.349
the Liberal Party leftist don't give a

2233.119 --> 2238.73
[ __ ] about anything

2234.349 --> 2245.599
they only care about control so if a big

2238.73 --> 2249.02
corporation is headed by a a Marxist

2245.599 --> 2253.75
leftist fanatic that supports the

2249.02 --> 2253.75
political agenda a lot they love them

2254.41 --> 2261.68
it's all totally politicized now there

2257.63 --> 2266.06
is no moral guidance at all it's all

2261.68 --> 2268.81
pure power politics based all of it this

2266.06 --> 2268.81
is disgusting

2283.74 --> 2289.52
hmm

2285.35 --> 2293.42
alright five artists liberality yeah you

2289.52 --> 2296.9
know that happened due to P Mars and I'm

2293.42 --> 2300.05
not opening up the panel since that I

2296.9 --> 2302.87
now I kind of I don't like the the

2300.05 --> 2307.5800000000004
Google thing anymore the Google panel

2302.87 --> 2311.93
I'm just doing it through Skype now it's

2307.58 --> 2313.85
a lot more stable and people I would

2311.93 --> 2317.21
really like on my show are in there

2313.85 --> 2319.61
anyway yeah that's why I keep on asking

2317.21 --> 2321.94
at me through Skype in the description

2319.61 --> 2321.94
box below

2327.46 --> 2336.31
if you want to be a serious guest or a

2330.77 --> 2336.31
panel member that's the way to get in

2348.02 --> 2355.57
all right well dysfunctional everyone

2352.25 --> 2360.08
has their own detailed theories about

2355.57 --> 2364.01
the dynamics of the Liberal Party I'd

2360.08 --> 2366.35
like to hear your explanation of it

2364.01 --> 2368.78
sometime maybe you could come on the

2366.35 --> 2371.0299999999997
show add me on skype you couldn't

2368.78 --> 2374.15
explain it to everyone I'd love to hear

2371.03 --> 2376.3300000000004
that I'm up for a discussion about all

2374.15 --> 2376.33
of that

2382.57 --> 2387.6800000000003
what don't eat with my fingers what the

2385.25 --> 2390.98
hell like what am I supposed to eat a

2387.68 --> 2393.7
croissant with a fork that doesn't make

2390.98 --> 2393.7
any sense to me

2434.08 --> 2437.139
[Music]

2482.87 --> 2486.4
[Music]

2495.04 --> 2498.67
now that's a silly

2507.76 --> 2518.4100000000003
hmm to be fair I I understand something

2515.29 --> 2522.07
like there's quite extensive ways you

2518.41 --> 2524.74
could have like table manners and though

2522.07 --> 2527.77
when I realized that there is really

2524.74 --> 2531.79
kind of important to do that I can do

2527.77 --> 2533.68
that I do know the rules but I to be

2531.79 --> 2537.73
fair I'm kind of an animal when it comes

2533.68 --> 2541.4199999999996
to food but that might also be because I

2537.73 --> 2545.13
just I really like my food and I do my

2541.42 --> 2550.08
best to make it absolutely awesome and

2545.13 --> 2550.08
then I just go into feeding frenzies

2550.109 --> 2554.56
although I definitely tried not to do it

2553.3 --> 2557.82
in front of other people like that

2554.56 --> 2557.82
because that's just embarrassing

2568.69 --> 2573.9500000000003
what I'm not eating like that right now

2571.64 --> 2577.42
I'm just eating a cursor okay

2573.95 --> 2580.64
I'm not eating like a beast right now

2577.42 --> 2585.2200000000003
Jesus come on I'm just eating a cow

2580.64 --> 2585.22
what's the problem I don't get it

2601.41 --> 2609.64
yep yeah x3 20 watches the show

2605.59 --> 2615.01
especially before me eating possums and

2609.64 --> 2618.64
other things apparently you're always

2615.01 --> 2622.9
welcome to reward me through the super

2618.64 --> 2626.79
chat for that by the way x3 20 if you

2622.9 --> 2635.8
really appreciate it so much because ya

2626.79 --> 2639.43
tell songs and such do cost and I just

2635.8 --> 2648.61
had a really really annoying shitty

2639.43 --> 2653.29
letter from the county basically that oh

2648.61 --> 2655.23
yeah we received your report of making

2653.29 --> 2658.23
money from Google we're gonna now take

2655.23 --> 2660.9900000000002
pretty much all of that out of your

2658.23 --> 2664.48
social welfare the next time great

2660.99 --> 2667.72
that's just absolutely fantastic that

2664.48 --> 2672.82
means that I'll probably barely be able

2667.72 --> 2678.97
to eat in two weeks that's just

2672.82 --> 2681.88
fantastic so yeah because of that I'm I

2678.97 --> 2686.3799999999997
am seriously seriously considering of

2681.88 --> 2689.04
just closing the super chat because it

2686.38 --> 2689.04
is such a waste

2691.23 --> 2696.01
although yeah it is kind of nice

2693.34 --> 2698.6800000000003
invisible and I do appreciate the

2696.01 --> 2702.9100000000003
interaction but it's it's just terrible

2698.68 --> 2705.58
to save it's just waste but on the other

2702.91 --> 2708.8799999999997
hand if you actually really want to make

2705.58 --> 2714.93
a difference donate to my paypal because

2708.88 --> 2714.9300000000003
I don't it's not involved it's just

2715.17 --> 2719.859
literally handing money it's not through

2718.03 --> 2724.2400000000002
a company it's not a paycheck

2719.859 --> 2727.3199999999997
so please please through PayPal yet some

2724.24 --> 2730.8999999999996
people some of my followers especially

2727.32 --> 2733.53
in the first three months that I opened

2730.9 --> 2737.14
up the super chat really helped me out

2733.53 --> 2741.55
before that even through PayPal that

2737.14 --> 2745.1189999999997
helped a lot I'm not getting into

2741.55 --> 2748.21
trouble because of that so if you want

2745.119 --> 2749.13
to help me out PayPal is the very best

2748.21 --> 2753.27
option

2749.13 --> 2759.01
PayPal doesn't hate me so far it seems

2753.27 --> 2760.96
so it's not yeah cutting me off or

2759.01 --> 2762.46
anything I'm not that extreme apparently

2760.96 --> 2767.349
or they just don't care I'm too small

2762.46 --> 2769.0
but donating to pay my paypal and you

2767.349 --> 2774.01
can find it in the description box below

2769.0 --> 2778.66
I too is the most the best solution for

2774.01 --> 2780.94
me so just saying and patreon I'd still

2778.66 --> 2783.73
experimental pretty much but I think

2780.94 --> 2787.23
I've linked to patreon to the PayPal so

2783.73 --> 2787.23
that should work out fine as well

2795.84 --> 2804.1800000000003
right fine each now I'm not gonna say

2799.08 --> 2805.86
[ __ ] them because I'm still getting my

2804.18 --> 2811.5899999999997
money from them and for it's an

2805.86 --> 2814.86
unfortunate truth I just hope that my

2811.59 --> 2816.9
tax guy which was basically appointed to

2814.86 --> 2822.4500000000003
me it's kind of like an extra service

2816.9 --> 2825.0
you get nothing really tax why is

2822.45 --> 2826.89
interesting to report too much but I

2825.0 --> 2833.03
hope he will kind of like work it out

2826.89 --> 2837.75
that it can be deduced somehow from my

2833.03 --> 2840.27
my tax debt that I still have basically

2837.75 --> 2843.15
that came out of the situation with my

2840.27 --> 2845.64
axe so I hope it's not gonna be a total

2843.15 --> 2850.28
100% ways that I'm literally not getting

2845.64 --> 2850.2799999999997
anything out of it on the long run but

2850.37 --> 2856.23
yeah

2853.31 --> 2862.44
PayPal much more convenient so enough

2856.23 --> 2868.38
about that I'll survive

2862.44 --> 2872.16
oh yeah I'm drawing another region like

2868.38 --> 2876.27
pretty much right next to the to the

2872.16 --> 2878.5499999999997
other thing it's basically it a well

2876.27 --> 2882.72
it's kind of like a very big wizard

2878.55 --> 2885.63
tower complex on this on the peak of a

2882.72 --> 2890.27
mountain at an ocean and here's a little

2885.63 --> 2890.27
village then to crossroads

2891.11 --> 2896.1200000000003
so yeah that's moving

2899.14 --> 2909.1099999999997
this is an old version but it basically

2903.22 --> 2911.1699999999996
interconnects like this so roughly like

2909.11 --> 2911.17
this

2915.34 --> 2926.4700000000003
so you can see the road and the

2917.38 --> 2930.33
coastline interconnect they're working

2926.47 --> 2934.8999999999996
on moving on D D so that's still

2930.33 --> 2937.69
preoccupying me a lot because it's it's

2934.9 --> 2940.06
real in my mind this is like a continuum

2937.69 --> 2947.07
and it's just crystallizing and

2940.06 --> 2950.74
manifesting almost like a matrix or I

2947.07 --> 2954.9300000000003
think could probably be very much

2950.74 --> 2954.93
compared to being the latest Tron movie

2955.02 --> 2966.34
literally a realm just manifesting

2959.2 --> 2968.47
becoming more detailed as by design so

2966.34 --> 2972.13
yeah this is just all starting to

2968.47 --> 2976.12
manifest in my mind and then I put as I

2972.13 --> 2981.28
draw it and have a lot of ideas about

2976.12 --> 2983.41
just the social ongoings I've already

2981.28 --> 2986.6800000000003
provided secret histories even because

2983.41 --> 2990.2999999999997
it's just inevitable every historical

2986.68 --> 2992.6499999999996
story about empires will be

2990.3 --> 2995.7400000000002
oversimplified and very politically

2992.65 --> 2999.21
convenient for the morale of the rulers

2995.74 --> 3003.6
and it would always be alive pretty much

2999.21 --> 3006.15
I've already settled on that so there

3003.6 --> 3010.29
will be like a cult information that is

3006.15 --> 3012.09
not supposed to be talked about because

3010.29 --> 3015.32
that just makes it more real and more

3012.09 --> 3015.32
interesting to work with

3034.29 --> 3042.45
yeah well what am i up to next year I

3039.93 --> 3047.33
have no idea it all really depends on my

3042.45 --> 3047.33
whole financial situation

3052.53 --> 3059.02
it's probably mostly gonna be the same

3055.42 --> 3061.06
maybe a little bit more maybe I'm gonna

3059.02 --> 3064.2599999999998
reach like a critical momentum and

3061.06 --> 3067.54
suddenly start doing other things

3064.26 --> 3071.65
who knows maybe somehow I will get some

3067.54 --> 3074.58
kind of job no idea I don't expect it

3071.65 --> 3078.2200000000003
I'm absolutely not counting on it but I

3074.58 --> 3082.2
know I could do it if it is actually a

3078.22 --> 3086.4599999999996
proper job for somebody like me and

3082.2 --> 3086.46
that's the more difficult part

3091.85 --> 3103.68
okay alrighty dokie okay

3099.33 --> 3106.88
the people in chat are not - they are

3103.68 --> 3106.8799999999997
all over the place today

3135.88 --> 3141.13
a movie India from the 80s okay that

3138.91 --> 3145.6299999999997
thank you for being super specific there

3141.13 --> 3149.4300000000003
five artists live rallies I'm glad it

3145.63 --> 3159.04
reminded you of a movie in the eighties

3149.43 --> 3161.49
no idea what you're talking about The

3159.04 --> 3161.49
Goonies

3169.03 --> 3173.92
that's definitely one movie from the 80s

3192.64 --> 3195.8799999999997
all right

3196.34 --> 3203.75
look are you asking me for in each what

3199.19 --> 3209.81
jobs did I have I know not a lot of

3203.75 --> 3213.08
things I've I've been or still am a

3209.81 --> 3216.16
goldsmith and I had have I did have a

3213.08 --> 3220.79
company and it did do orders quite a few

3216.16 --> 3224.33
but not up to standard to actually make

3220.79 --> 3231.47
a living off that not even close but I

3224.33 --> 3233.96
am good at it that's just that I have a

3231.47 --> 3237.68
typically more artistic approach and not

3233.96 --> 3239.27
so much a I'll make it efficient and

3237.68 --> 3241.1299999999997
just make as much money out of it as

3239.27 --> 3246.02
possible which is kind of required in

3241.13 --> 3250.85
order to just to survive on that other

3246.02 --> 3252.77
than that yeah right I'm a place totally

3250.85 --> 3255.89
silly but yeah I am a paper boy right

3252.77 --> 3258.35
now it's barely but it's like a recorded

3255.89 --> 3261.98
more as a hobby and make just a few

3258.35 --> 3263.5699999999997
bucks out of it it's literally

3261.98 --> 3269.09
insignificant but I kind of like doing

3263.57 --> 3276.25
it and yeah other than that I am now a

3269.09 --> 3279.7400000000002
Google employee live performer

3276.25 --> 3283.66
advertisement money collector and super

3279.74 --> 3283.66
jet collector that's now official so

3286.99 --> 3292.49
but yeah and the gun is gonna see very

3290.42 --> 3294.38
little from super Chad donations

3292.49 --> 3305.52

3294.38 --> 3309.05
my my social welfare unfortunately yeah
