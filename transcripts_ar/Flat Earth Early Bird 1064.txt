yeah getting up early is kind of like

182.72 --> 186.879
messed up my internal workings

188.4 --> 193.12
so we'll see what happens

191.12 --> 194.879
i might not join the flat earth debates

193.12 --> 197.76
after this i don't know

194.879 --> 199.76
depends on how it goes

197.76 --> 200.959

crockett

200.959 --> 204.519

240.319 --> 246.64
actually watched it all back

242.959 --> 246.64000000000001
i was pretty satisfied about it

249.28 --> 254.68
hello stone monkey 3d hey just stone

251.68 --> 254.68
monkey

270.479 --> 273.479
uh

287.199 --> 291.6
right so yeah

288.96 --> 291.59999999999997
shorten it

294.96 --> 299.28
right so yeah i'm not starting an hour

297.199 --> 300.40000000000003
later because of some time difference

299.28 --> 303.67999999999995
i'm just

300.4 --> 303.67999999999995
an hour late this time

305.039 --> 308.88
how's today

306.96 --> 310.4
yeah i'm a

308.88 --> 313.44
i don't know i'm a

310.4 --> 315.35999999999996
yeah a little bit wobbly

313.44 --> 317.36
because i got up really early and that

315.36 --> 319.039
kind of messed me up a little but i'm

317.36 --> 320.72
okay it's just

319.039 --> 321.919
yeah

320.72 --> 323.199
i've been like

321.919 --> 325.84
out there

323.199 --> 330.0
on my bike and like talking with service

325.84 --> 330.0
day who's sitting outside here

331.199 --> 335.36
but yeah that's kind of like throwing me

332.88 --> 335.36
off a little

336.84 --> 342.67999999999995
uh

338.72 --> 342.68
but i'm doing good overall

357.039 --> 362.56
right so yeah yesterday was relatively

359.759 --> 362.56
uneventful

362.639 --> 367.28000000000003
a lot of things

364.08 --> 369.84
going down

367.28 --> 372.96
although yeah i noticed that rv went at

369.84 --> 376.0
it again this time

372.96 --> 378.15999999999997
patricia steer a flat earth poker

376.0 --> 381.84
it i didn't really follow it but it's

378.16 --> 381.84000000000003
just like oh come on

382.72 --> 386.28000000000003
other than that

395.68 --> 398.639
yeah it's been pretty quiet day

397.36 --> 402.36
yesterday

398.639 --> 402.36
that was kind of nice

417.919 --> 424.71999999999997
as long as i'm good yeah no i'm fine

421.36 --> 424.72
just a little wobbly but

431.12 --> 434.8
i think it might have something to do

432.72 --> 436.88000000000005
with drinking that coffee unusually

434.8 --> 438.96000000000004
early

436.88 --> 442.88
usually don't respond too well to

438.96 --> 442.88
drinking coffee really early

448.639 --> 451.84000000000003
hello clutch

484.4 --> 488.08
hey elise g

486.16 --> 490.879
good to see you

488.08 --> 492.4
right so yeah it's it's monday

490.879 --> 496.72
by the way

492.4 --> 499.12
monday the 8th of november 2021

496.72 --> 503.8
it's a short show today i'll be back to

499.12 --> 503.8
my normal format tomorrow

511.28 --> 516.4789999999999
right one thing i did noticed or both of

513.279 --> 518.479
us did notice that we talked about it

516.479 --> 521.12
is that it seems like everybody like

518.479 --> 523.6800000000001
there's this stupid masks thing going on

521.12 --> 526.16
again out there

523.68 --> 527.3599999999999
but yeah i'm not wearing it and i got my

526.16 --> 529.4399999999999
card

527.36 --> 532.32
to show

529.44 --> 534.399
so yeah it's just that i

532.32 --> 536.72
it's kind of embarrassing that

534.399 --> 539.36
they're mandating that [ __ ] again it's

536.72 --> 539.36
ridiculous

540.64 --> 545.12
especially because it's pretty much on

542.8 --> 546.7199999999999
camera been admitted by like even

545.12 --> 548.48
minister of health and all that that it

546.72 --> 551.2
doesn't work

548.48 --> 555.04
so it's ridiculous the whole situation

551.2 --> 555.0400000000001
here is quite ridiculous like that

571.68 --> 575.88
all right i'll be back in two minutes

716.16 --> 718.48
right

727.6 --> 732.8000000000001
hello stazmaretz woodworking gunny bear

732.959 --> 737.68
yeah it's a it's a medical exemption car

738.72 --> 745.6
i had it for like a long time

742.399 --> 749.36
since beginning 2020 my dad came with it

745.6 --> 749.36
but it's like an official thing so

750.399 --> 753.04
yeah

751.36 --> 754.16
i don't know if you recognize it there's

753.04 --> 756.48
like a

754.16 --> 759.279
link to an official dutch government

756.48 --> 762.16
website on it and all that so

759.279 --> 762.16
yeah and that works

763.6 --> 767.2
they don't tell you about it

767.6 --> 771.0
but it's there

799.36 --> 805.2
right so yeah i got uh like roughly 45

802.72 --> 807.0400000000001
minutes i think

805.2 --> 808.0790000000001
so yeah whatever you guys want to talk

807.04 --> 812.0
about

808.079 --> 812.0
as long as it's not too dark or anything

812.24 --> 815.24
blue

826.839 --> 831.12
to check

828.8 --> 831.12
okay

832.56 --> 837.04
oh that's very distracting but that's

834.8 --> 837.04
fine

837.12 --> 844.079
you won't even notice i'm here

840.24 --> 848.0
all right i can literally see you as i

844.079 --> 848.0
stare at the screen but that's fine

849.279 --> 852.56
say hello

850.72 --> 853.6800000000001
hello

852.56 --> 857.0
good morning

853.68 --> 857.0
early birds

861.839 --> 866.8000000000001
can we talk about the the elephant in

864.399 --> 866.8
the room

867.04 --> 873.4399999999999
no that's uh that's that's dutch sailor

871.6 --> 875.36
or formerly known as dutch sailor

873.44 --> 876.9590000000001
service day

875.36 --> 877.76
like he did come by like he said he

876.959 --> 880.8
would

877.76 --> 885.48
and yeah i got a monitor

880.8 --> 885.4799999999999
i haven't tested it out yet because

886.24 --> 890.0
all right so yeah pretty cool

888.32 --> 891.519
um

890.0 --> 893.76
yeah

891.519 --> 897.36
it's like

893.76 --> 900.0
it's dirty but other than that

897.36 --> 901.04
it'll probably do just fine so i don't

900.0 --> 903.44
know

901.04 --> 906.56
all right it's got the touch uh button

903.44 --> 906.5600000000001
over here oh

907.04 --> 913.04
right so yeah i'll have that as a backup

910.0 --> 915.12
so if my like my monitor suddenly like

913.04 --> 917.199
really dies

915.12 --> 920.16
then i'll have a replacement monitor so

917.199 --> 921.76
i'm very happy with that thanks dude

920.16 --> 924.16
and uh

921.76 --> 926.3199999999999
right but i do have like the knack of

924.16 --> 928.8
how my monitor works now really under

926.32 --> 928.8000000000001
control

929.36 --> 932.32
uh

930.639 --> 935.12
so yeah i don't know how long it left

932.32 --> 937.1990000000001
maybe my seriously my monitor could

935.12 --> 939.6
potentially

937.199 --> 941.68
potentially but you never really know

939.6 --> 942.639
could maybe last for like another two

941.68 --> 944.88
years

942.639 --> 947.92
ills just always have the weird startup

944.88 --> 950.399
issues but maybe it's not gonna die out

947.92 --> 951.8389999999999
because of that maybe it's gonna last a

950.399 --> 955.56
lot longer

951.839 --> 955.5600000000001
you never really know

959.759 --> 965.92
in regard to rv truth and david wise you

962.959 --> 969.3599999999999
were right but for the wrong reason what

965.92 --> 972.16
what does that mean

969.36 --> 974.399
he sounds more dutch accent to me yeah i

972.16 --> 974.399
know

978.48 --> 982.9200000000001
yeah he is a very typical dutch jackson

986.72 --> 990.399
oh and for all the bears there

990.88 --> 994.56
he's very white

993.36 --> 995.36
and

994.56 --> 999.279
he

995.36 --> 1000.48
professionally gathers copper

999.279 --> 1003.12
scrap metal

1000.48 --> 1005.279
yep scrap metal that contains every

1003.12 --> 1006.88
metal right and he's making a killing

1005.279 --> 1008.88
from it too so

1006.88 --> 1010.56
i just thought it was really funny since

1008.88 --> 1013.04
big bear

1010.56 --> 1017.5189999999999
brought that theme up and all that

1013.04 --> 1021.04
he doesn't by the way know meth

1017.519 --> 1021.04
like but he does like his weed

1023.279 --> 1026.88
yeah

1024.72 --> 1028.48
it's just every time now i hear big bear

1026.88 --> 1031.679
talking about that i always think like

1028.48 --> 1031.679
of this guy it's like huh

1033.36 --> 1038.76
because he does really have a knack for

1035.28 --> 1038.76
finding it

1041.6 --> 1047.12
he went after david weiss character that

1043.76 --> 1047.12
deserved a face to face

1060.799 --> 1065.12
i don't know though why did you say like

1063.2 --> 1068.64
i was right but for the wrong reason

1065.12 --> 1068.6399999999999
what do you mean the wrong reason

1068.88 --> 1075.0
woodward gunny bear

1070.799 --> 1075.0
hello cbs by the way

1085.36 --> 1091.32
it's all white people

1088.16 --> 1091.3200000000002
all right

1100.64 --> 1103.919
right yeah woodworking gunny but look

1102.559 --> 1106.32
i'm just

1103.919 --> 1107.76
surprised not that i necessarily want

1106.32 --> 1110.1599999999999
him to do that

1107.76 --> 1111.52
i'm just really surprised he hasn't gone

1110.16 --> 1113.2
after me

1111.52 --> 1116.72
i mean

1113.2 --> 1119.919
i literally have 33 in my email oh and

1116.72 --> 1121.52
by the way arwyn apparently gm gmatria

1119.919 --> 1124.7990000000002
wise also

1121.52 --> 1124.799
adds up to 30.

1127.44 --> 1133.76
yeah you're definitely amazing arwen

1129.84 --> 1133.76
oh yeah oh yeah for sure

1134.84 --> 1140.72
sarcasm i mean i'm a goldsmith

1138.48 --> 1140.72
so

1141.36 --> 1144.0
i

1142.799 --> 1145.84
like

1144.0 --> 1147.679
playing characters

1145.84 --> 1151.559
i don't know it's

1147.679 --> 1151.5590000000002
but no it's like

1151.84 --> 1154.0
no

1157.039 --> 1162.8799999999999
like you have to go through some stuff

1160.4 --> 1165.039
to be amazing but it's not even just

1162.88 --> 1166.48
that it's like what are you doing are

1165.039 --> 1168.96
you

1166.48 --> 1171.84
an active mason or are you just a member

1168.96 --> 1173.919
of the club and you're like

1171.84 --> 1175.4399999999998
that's they're just your buddies that's

1173.919 --> 1176.24
it

1175.44 --> 1178.799
right

1176.24 --> 1182.88
i don't think that most people even know

1178.799 --> 1182.8799999999999
like what freemasons actually do

1183.84 --> 1188.799
like what makes them an acting arm

1189.2 --> 1194.64
because if you're just gonna go for ooh

1191.52 --> 1196.799
secret hidden thingies and sights and

1194.64 --> 1198.0
symbols and

1196.799 --> 1199.36
then

1198.0 --> 1203.28
like people

1199.36 --> 1206.32
literally know about that symbol thingy

1203.28 --> 1208.72
and the whole illuminati secret right

1206.32 --> 1211.6789999999999
that's been so out there for a while

1208.72 --> 1216.0
that people literally just start using

1211.679 --> 1216.0
it to be attention grabby

1216.64 --> 1221.76
well often they don't even really

1218.4 --> 1224.24
understand what masons even do

1221.76 --> 1225.2
for real they just go into conspirator

1224.24 --> 1228.44
land

1225.2 --> 1228.44
with it

1235.12 --> 1238.2399999999998
okay one for the unit

1241.039 --> 1245.36
yeah

1243.12 --> 1245.36
low

1246.32 --> 1249.32
okay

1250.159 --> 1254.48
well if you want to say something

1251.919 --> 1256.48
service day you can just say it yeah i

1254.48 --> 1259.1200000000001
know

1256.48 --> 1260.799

1259.12 --> 1262.9599999999998
the connection i wanted to read with

1260.799 --> 1265.52
with you but

1262.96 --> 1266.559
i have no connection it's no problem all

1265.52 --> 1268.08
right

1266.559 --> 1271.24
do your thing man

1268.08 --> 1271.24
i will

1277.919 --> 1282.0
yeah they become more apparent as you

1279.52 --> 1284.1589999999999
become tuned in to the right or wrong

1282.0 --> 1285.6
frequency well

1284.159 --> 1288.0800000000002
yes

1285.6 --> 1291.1999999999998
but it's also what

1288.08 --> 1295.36
let's just say just in media world what

1291.2 --> 1295.3600000000001
do freemasons actually do

1295.679 --> 1299.2
can anybody in chat tell me

1300.0 --> 1307.64
it should be a you should be able to

1302.159 --> 1307.64
easily summarize it with max three words

1314.46 --> 1317.559
[Music]

1318.4 --> 1322.72
right yeah well that's like what are you

1320.559 --> 1325.76
going to define and how did they build

1322.72 --> 1328.4
up their ideas etc etc what does it

1325.76 --> 1330.84
resemble yeah that's nice but

1328.4 --> 1332.48
what do freemasons

1330.84 --> 1334.32
actually

1332.48 --> 1336.64
do

1334.32 --> 1337.9189999999999
in relation to media can somebody point

1336.64 --> 1340.24
that out to me

1337.919 --> 1342.88
this would be very easy i'm asking you

1340.24 --> 1342.88
it's a test

1343.28 --> 1346.28
right

1359.12 --> 1362.7199999999998
come on guys

1361.28 --> 1363.84
i'm wonky

1362.72 --> 1364.88
but

1363.84 --> 1369.48
i don't know

1364.88 --> 1369.48
you should this is not a hard one

1382.4 --> 1385.3600000000001
right woodworking gunny bear yeah that's

1384.48 --> 1386.24
right

1385.36 --> 1388.9599999999998
that's

1386.24 --> 1391.52
the other side right but in media if

1388.96 --> 1394.24
somebody is going to be a freemason

1391.52 --> 1396.72
active on media

1394.24 --> 1398.48
what do they do

1396.72 --> 1402.3600000000001
can you tell me that

1398.48 --> 1402.3600000000001
not everything else

1418.0 --> 1422.48
yeah but see like dude that doesn't mean

1420.24 --> 1425.1200000000001
anything though if you're just like oh

1422.48 --> 1427.76
the only thing if it's like a fight club

1425.12 --> 1429.6789999999999
situation you just don't talk about it

1427.76 --> 1432.8799999999999
well what does it matter then if there's

1429.679 --> 1434.72
no distinguishable difference

1432.88 --> 1437.0390000000002
like oh you got to keep secret that

1434.72 --> 1439.2
you're in the secret club

1437.039 --> 1440.96
but

1439.2 --> 1443.44
they don't do anything

1440.96 --> 1445.8400000000001
necessarily in just a secret club that's

1443.44 --> 1445.8400000000001
not it

1448.96 --> 1452.48
you're a mason of the stone yeah but i'm

1450.88 --> 1456.1200000000001
not talking about stone masons i'm

1452.48 --> 1456.1200000000001
talking about freemasons

1459.12 --> 1465.52
they get paranoid people to chase

1461.84 --> 1468.3999999999999
pissed on broad crumbs that's

1465.52 --> 1470.32
that's a decent way to describe it yes

1468.4 --> 1472.88
it's much more integral than i expected

1470.32 --> 1475.6
as a first response

1472.88 --> 1478.0
but yes what do they do

1475.6 --> 1479.1999999999998
they create

1478.0 --> 1480.88
false

1479.2 --> 1483.6000000000001
narratives

1480.88 --> 1486.48
and then they hold on to the false

1483.6 --> 1487.84
narratives they write a story and the

1486.48 --> 1489.919
story

1487.84 --> 1494.6399999999999
is compatible

1489.919 --> 1496.96
with the other freemason stories you see

1494.64 --> 1496.96
now

1497.52 --> 1502.6399999999999
now with that realization you can start

1500.24 --> 1504.48
to point out people that you know are

1502.64 --> 1506.7990000000002
freemasons what stories are they

1504.48 --> 1509.919
upholding

1506.799 --> 1509.9189999999999
what fake narratives

1510.4 --> 1514.48
right because that is truly

1513.2 --> 1517.6000000000001
like you can

1514.48 --> 1520.88
be upholding a freemason narrative by

1517.6 --> 1521.84
accident because you believe it's real

1520.88 --> 1523.0390000000002
see

1521.84 --> 1524.8799999999999
you bought it

1523.039 --> 1527.8799999999999
and you're gonna like yeah yeah this and

1524.88 --> 1527.88
that

1528.0 --> 1535.039
right but a freemason

1531.36 --> 1536.8799999999999
is informed about what is fake

1535.039 --> 1540.48
and then they

1536.88 --> 1542.72
carry on with it they help construct the

1540.48 --> 1544.96
narrative but it has to be kind of

1542.72 --> 1547.6000000000001
compatible or you'll yeah otherwise

1544.96 --> 1547.6000000000001
you're not gonna

1548.24 --> 1553.799
get promoted or anything you're not

1550.08 --> 1553.799
gonna get a lot of connections

1559.12 --> 1562.799
see

1560.32 --> 1564.1589999999999
so how do you truly recognize a

1562.799 --> 1566.72
freemason

1564.159 --> 1567.7600000000002
you don't recognize them because in a

1566.72 --> 1570.48
goofy

1567.76 --> 1573.039
moment or attention graviness which is

1570.48 --> 1576.08
kind of petty i agree but if you're like

1573.039 --> 1578.24
oh i'm backwards on a ladder and i where

1576.08 --> 1579.4399999999998
i've got a corona in my head yeah come

1578.24 --> 1582.32
on guys

1579.44 --> 1584.3200000000002
that doesn't make you amazing

1582.32 --> 1586.24
that makes you an attention-grabby

1584.32 --> 1588.559
person

1586.24 --> 1592.24
what makes you amazing is if you are

1588.559 --> 1594.32
part of a provable false narrative

1592.24 --> 1596.88
that even when confronted with you'll be

1594.32 --> 1599.6
like no no no that's fake you're

1596.88 --> 1602.0
untrustworthy you're gonna gatekeep the

1599.6 --> 1605.84
narrative

1602.0 --> 1608.08
that's typical freemasonry

1605.84 --> 1608.08
right

1609.12 --> 1613.52
it's like when you keep a narrative that

1610.72 --> 1615.44
you know is fake and then you don't

1613.52 --> 1618.48
adapt you see

1615.44 --> 1620.88
you only adapt within the context of

1618.48 --> 1624.0
assuming the fake narrative is real so

1620.88 --> 1626.3200000000002
you help construct the narrative

1624.0 --> 1628.88
but you never allow yourself to get to

1626.32 --> 1630.3999999999999
the realization or like the the

1628.88 --> 1632.5590000000002
the honestness

1630.4 --> 1633.44
like this is actually fake or i was

1632.559 --> 1636.799
wrong

1633.44 --> 1637.919
freemasons don't do that

1636.799 --> 1641.039
not with

1637.919 --> 1643.039
like narrative involved things because

1641.039 --> 1646.08
that's part of the secrecy like you have

1643.039 --> 1648.559
to keep it a secret that it's fake

1646.08 --> 1650.799
the narrative

1648.559 --> 1650.799
those

1652.84 --> 1658.72
narratives see so yeah

1656.32 --> 1659.6789999999999
with that knowledge let's look at david

1658.72 --> 1662.72
wise

1659.679 --> 1664.96
what narrative is he upholding that is

1662.72 --> 1666.48
clearly in lockstep line with

1664.96 --> 1669.919
freemasonry

1666.48 --> 1671.679
what project from the freemasons verbal

1669.919 --> 1674.96
project

1671.679 --> 1677.3600000000001
idea project is he contributing to

1674.96 --> 1677.3600000000001
you see

1677.52 --> 1683.76
then you'll find out no he's not really

1680.159 --> 1685.8400000000001
doing that unless you are absolutely

1683.76 --> 1689.44
beyond the doubt convinced

1685.84 --> 1693.12
that like the the flat disk earth

1689.44 --> 1694.799
model promotion is kind of a freemason

1693.12 --> 1697.76
narrative

1694.799 --> 1700.6399999999999
and that's a tricky one is it

1697.76 --> 1703.2
did they kind of take it on onto them to

1700.64 --> 1703.2
do that

1703.36 --> 1708.84
to like let the flat earth awakening

1705.52 --> 1712.24
happen but really in a very

1708.84 --> 1715.1999999999998
cornered cut off way with

1712.24 --> 1719.2
their yeah a limited model

1715.2 --> 1721.279
did they do that i don't know

1719.2 --> 1724.64
i know they know about that sort of

1721.279 --> 1726.0
stuff a lot of the information that even

1724.64 --> 1728.3990000000001
we dig up

1726.0 --> 1730.0
also come through

1728.399 --> 1732.559
freemason

1730.0 --> 1734.72
group research

1732.559 --> 1738.44
right

1734.72 --> 1738.44
i'm hearing myself

1744.399 --> 1748.2399999999998
so yeah

1746.0 --> 1748.24
but

1748.559 --> 1753.9189999999999
then remains okay so

1751.279 --> 1756.48
if let's just say if

1753.919 --> 1758.88
the disc was actually a freemason

1756.48 --> 1759.679
narrative

1758.88 --> 1762.3990000000001
well

1759.679 --> 1765.1200000000001
are people adapting their understanding

1762.399 --> 1767.12
of it or are they saying yeah yeah yeah

1765.12 --> 1770.6399999999999
i know there's all kinds of ideas of

1767.12 --> 1774.08
what the earth as a flat earth could be

1770.64 --> 1776.0
but i don't trust any of them no i know

1774.08 --> 1777.9189999999999
it's the disk

1776.0 --> 1779.679
right now that would be a little

1777.919 --> 1780.3990000000001
suspicious

1779.679 --> 1783.76
but

1780.399 --> 1783.76
is david wise doing that

1783.84 --> 1787.52
or is he just like no i'm just gonna go

1786.24 --> 1789.039
with the disc

1787.52 --> 1791.6
but yeah it could turn out to be

1789.039 --> 1794.32
something else right and he is even like

1791.6 --> 1796.9599999999998
getting wilder saying like what what's

1794.32 --> 1797.84
beyond there is it like puddles

1796.96 --> 1799.279
right

1797.84 --> 1801.6
is that

1799.279 --> 1803.679
part of a freemason narrative

1801.6 --> 1805.9189999999999
development

1803.679 --> 1809.52
i don't know i don't think so it doesn't

1805.919 --> 1810.64
feel like it and the way they deal with

1809.52 --> 1813.2
it

1810.64 --> 1813.2
it's not

1813.76 --> 1817.2
it's not gate capped enough

1818.08 --> 1822.279
so yeah things get complicated

1834.96 --> 1839.6000000000001
right so yeah if you get keep that all

1838.08 --> 1841.76
in mind

1839.6 --> 1843.039
and you cross reference it to things out

1841.76 --> 1846.08
there

1843.039 --> 1850.8799999999999
then you should be very easily be able

1846.08 --> 1852.72
to see that well what people like rv do

1850.88 --> 1854.72
when they get oh look at the symbols

1852.72 --> 1856.559
he's secretly freemason

1854.72 --> 1859.76
and it's very easy to figure out that

1856.559 --> 1862.399
that's complete horseshit

1859.76 --> 1864.48
because none of the accusations that he

1862.399 --> 1869.1999999999998
typically draws into it

1864.48 --> 1869.2
actually have anything to do with it

1869.919 --> 1874.72
that's not how you recognize a freemason

1872.399 --> 1875.5189999999998
you recognize a freemason

1874.72 --> 1880.72
by

1875.519 --> 1883.919
them upholding a part of fake narrative

1880.72 --> 1887.84
building on that and gatekeeping it

1883.919 --> 1887.8400000000001
and like being inflexible about it

1889.279 --> 1892.48
right like they're almost like reading

1891.2 --> 1894.3990000000001
from a book

1892.48 --> 1896.0
like no they don't want to debate it

1894.399 --> 1897.5189999999998
they're not going to adapt their opinion

1896.0 --> 1900.08
no they're just like no i'm just going

1897.519 --> 1902.159
to do that specific narrative that would

1900.08 --> 1904.399
be a little bit of suspicious thing then

1902.159 --> 1908.24
you could say like hmm

1904.399 --> 1908.2399999999998
why is he so inflexible about it

1908.559 --> 1912.72
like

1909.44 --> 1913.519
and why is it like set by mainstream

1912.72 --> 1915.919
right

1913.519 --> 1918.08
so you could say for example

1915.919 --> 1919.6000000000001
the whole astronaut and the moon landing

1918.08 --> 1920.96
thing is a

1919.6 --> 1923.6789999999999
narrative

1920.96 --> 1926.3990000000001
dude they all literally are on camera

1923.679 --> 1928.88
with the rings like they are freemasons

1926.399 --> 1930.9599999999998
everybody kind of knows their freemasons

1928.88 --> 1934.64
and they're upholding that narrative and

1930.96 --> 1936.24
they absolutely cannot break it

1934.64 --> 1938.159
they're not allowed it's like a serious

1936.24 --> 1940.0
danger for them that's how you know

1938.159 --> 1942.24
that's a freemason

1940.0 --> 1944.24
it's not because oh they had the secret

1942.24 --> 1946.3990000000001
thingy

1944.24 --> 1948.96
no it's because they're upholding a

1946.399 --> 1952.0
narrative and they can't break it

1948.96 --> 1953.8400000000001
even though when it becomes dispelled

1952.0 --> 1955.919
they can't just say okay it was i was

1953.84 --> 1957.36
wrong or this is actually fake now they

1955.919 --> 1959.679
can't say it

1957.36 --> 1962.4799999999998
that's how you know they're

1959.679 --> 1964.72
a freemason they're an active freemason

1962.48 --> 1966.559
upholding a narrative

1964.72 --> 1968.96
that's part of the system

1966.559 --> 1968.96
you see

1972.399 --> 1976.4799999999998
right and there's other things too it's

1974.48 --> 1979.679
like

1976.48 --> 1982.72
i personally believe

1979.679 --> 1984.799
based on my own cross references

1982.72 --> 1986.799
that the whole

1984.799 --> 1989.36
virus agenda

1986.799 --> 1991.279
and like oh it actually came from this

1989.36 --> 1994.32
laboratory and that and i think that

1991.279 --> 1996.24
that is an entire freemason construction

1994.32 --> 1998.0
it's a fake narrative

1996.24 --> 2001.6
because

1998.0 --> 2004.32
none of that idea of those planted ideas

2001.6 --> 2006.7199999999998
have any relevance to what's actually

2004.32 --> 2007.6
happening at all

2006.72 --> 2010.96
it's

2007.6 --> 2013.039
sowing fear that there's all this danger

2010.96 --> 2015.1200000000001
in these laboratories

2013.039 --> 2017.919
better than oh my god it's exploding

2015.12 --> 2019.84
into the world when none of that is real

2017.919 --> 2022.3990000000001
none

2019.84 --> 2022.399
none of it

2024.159 --> 2029.8400000000001
right i don't think anything happened i

2026.72 --> 2032.159
think that it was a chosen narrative

2029.84 --> 2033.6
that it was secretly like that so that

2032.159 --> 2036.0
when things

2033.6 --> 2037.12
go south and people start to

2036.0 --> 2040.0
find

2037.12 --> 2041.6789999999999
somebody to accuse for the situation

2040.0 --> 2043.44
that they would have something to

2041.679 --> 2047.279
present like oh there's this secret

2043.44 --> 2049.52
thing that happened there to blame

2047.279 --> 2052.96
and then they could even like work that

2049.52 --> 2055.599
out into like a a war confrontation

2052.96 --> 2058.0
agenda eventually if they needed to see

2055.599 --> 2061.3590000000004
that's like state building using

2058.0 --> 2062.24
narrative based on things that aren't

2061.359 --> 2063.7599999999998
real

2062.24 --> 2066.24
that's

2063.76 --> 2067.0400000000004
what freemasons do

2066.24 --> 2069.839
right

2067.04 --> 2073.2799999999997
because their narrative stories

2069.839 --> 2074.56
reach into the deepest

2073.28 --> 2077.8390000000004
regions

2074.56 --> 2080.639
of government policy

2077.839 --> 2080.639
and narrative

2081.119 --> 2085.44
right so now when you know that

2083.44 --> 2087.04
you really think david wise is a

2085.44 --> 2089.359
freemason

2087.04 --> 2092.0
or jaron

2089.359 --> 2094.24
like could you even like think of one

2092.0 --> 2095.599
thing that would like yeah man dude they

2094.24 --> 2097.9199999999996
totally

2095.599 --> 2099.839
are like one of that those type of free

2097.92 --> 2104.96
medicines with that narrative like oh

2099.839 --> 2104.96
really explain that to me lay it down

2107.119 --> 2114.079
and so yeah rv is kind of ridiculous

2110.88 --> 2117.76
and if anybody in the flat earth scene

2114.079 --> 2120.48
in all honesty is it freemason

2117.76 --> 2123.3590000000004
it's probably rv

2120.48 --> 2123.359
yeah i said it

2125.04 --> 2127.44
right

2125.839 --> 2129.2799999999997
because why

2127.44 --> 2132.079
he's gatekeeping

2129.28 --> 2135.28
he is reinforcing

2132.079 --> 2136.96
obviously planted false narrative

2135.28 --> 2138.96
conspirators

2136.96 --> 2141.92
right i think that the whole

2138.96 --> 2146.0
everybody is a [ __ ] i think that's a

2141.92 --> 2147.52
freemason invention yeah because it's

2146.0 --> 2150.16
ridiculous

2147.52 --> 2151.68
it makes people stupid it makes people

2150.16 --> 2155.1189999999997
paranoia

2151.68 --> 2156.72
and people that hold on to that tightly

2155.119 --> 2158.56
they

2156.72 --> 2160.0789999999997
literally

2158.56 --> 2162.24
like they don't

2160.079 --> 2164.48
present evidence and they go after you

2162.24 --> 2167.2
if you disagree that somebody they

2164.48 --> 2168.72
suspect being a [ __ ]

2167.2 --> 2171.52
if you disagree with that then they say

2168.72 --> 2173.52
oh you're a conspirator too well that's

2171.52 --> 2175.599
you know

2173.52 --> 2177.44
you could simply be kind of a paranoid

2175.599 --> 2179.44
delusional idiot

2177.44 --> 2180.64
and then like fall into that type of

2179.44 --> 2183.2000000000003
behavior

2180.64 --> 2187.7599999999998
or if you have like a big crowd and

2183.2 --> 2190.3199999999997
constantly do that like for five years

2187.76 --> 2193.119
periodically and you do it exactly the

2190.32 --> 2195.119
same way on the same level not adapting

2193.119 --> 2197.2000000000003
not learning not apologizing not

2195.119 --> 2199.44
reflecting personally

2197.2 --> 2201.52
like to what have i done is this the

2199.44 --> 2204.88
right thing that they don't even openly

2201.52 --> 2208.4
ask am i doing the right thing

2204.88 --> 2210.6400000000003
well then that becomes suspicious

2208.4 --> 2212.839
that it might be

2210.64 --> 2214.64
kind of a freemason

2212.839 --> 2216.56
activity

2214.64 --> 2219.04
or simply somebody that kind of like

2216.56 --> 2221.68
wants a numpty cult for themselves that

2219.04 --> 2222.88
they're just like scooping up paranoid

2221.68 --> 2225.1189999999997
people

2222.88 --> 2226.96
to keep riling them up and then they get

2225.119 --> 2229.119
addicted to it

2226.96 --> 2231.52
right it's not x it's like not

2229.119 --> 2233.52
definitive proof i'm not saying like oh

2231.52 --> 2235.119
my god i know

2233.52 --> 2238.32
i know

2235.119 --> 2240.2400000000002
rv is actually the mason i don't know

2238.32 --> 2243.04
but

2240.24 --> 2244.9599999999996
he's showing more signs of it

2243.04 --> 2247.04
than anybody i've ever met on the flat

2244.96 --> 2251.359
earth debates

2247.04 --> 2251.359
except well maybe patricia

2251.68 --> 2257.44
right

2252.88 --> 2259.839
like because she's had quite absorb yeah

2257.44 --> 2262.7200000000003
extreme amounts

2259.839 --> 2263.92
of virtue signaling like that

2262.72 --> 2267.68
but

2263.92 --> 2270.48
and yeah she is from a radio family

2267.68 --> 2272.8799999999997
that's also like yeah that's like almost

2270.48 --> 2273.92
how do you not get into that sort of

2272.88 --> 2276.8
thing

2273.92 --> 2278.2400000000002
if you're still gonna go for radio

2276.8 --> 2281.52
yourself

2278.24 --> 2286.4799999999996
it's tough but i don't really care

2281.52 --> 2289.599
with patricia because patricia herself

2286.48 --> 2291.92
is like she had like weird moments where

2289.599 --> 2294.32
she gets a little creepy but it's more

2291.92 --> 2296.88
like for the fun of it i guess just like

2294.32 --> 2299.44
mark sergeant has these moods and

2296.88 --> 2301.44
hey dude i get creepy moods myself it's

2299.44 --> 2304.32
just not in that sort of thing i don't

2301.44 --> 2308.16
play around with creepiness

2304.32 --> 2310.2400000000002
like i just kind of get a bit creepy

2308.16 --> 2312.64
and then afterwards i kind of apologize

2310.24 --> 2316.4799999999996
for it or try to reflect on it

2312.64 --> 2316.48
they don't really do that but

2318.8 --> 2324.2400000000002
like i don't think that if patricia is

2321.76 --> 2326.4
actually a freemason i don't think she's

2324.24 --> 2329.839
like an active one

2326.4 --> 2332.0
i think she's just like from

2329.839 --> 2334.16
like a family culture maybe where that

2332.0 --> 2335.839
is just like involved and it's maybe a

2334.16 --> 2337.5989999999997
part of business write the business

2335.839 --> 2339.7599999999998
connections and all that i'm not saying

2337.599 --> 2341.6800000000003
you are patricia and even by the way if

2339.76 --> 2345.5200000000004
you were i wouldn't mind

2341.68 --> 2345.52
i'm not scared of freemasons

2345.92 --> 2350.88
i'm just not gonna

2347.44 --> 2355.839
trust them blindly about everything

2350.88 --> 2355.839
but i rarely do that anyway with anybody

2360.64 --> 2364.56
i know mike sadoonich it's not the first

2362.56 --> 2366.16
time rv has done that with patricia's

2364.56 --> 2369.839
dear

2366.16 --> 2369.839
all right it's not the first time

2375.839 --> 2382.88
right but yeah patricia does leave has

2378.96 --> 2384.88
like left a whole bunch of sightings and

2382.88 --> 2389.04
pictures and things

2384.88 --> 2389.04
that do kind of make her suspicious but

2389.44 --> 2393.76
i have not been able to

2391.52 --> 2394.96
catch her on like

2393.76 --> 2396.88
really

2394.96 --> 2399.839
being an active

2396.88 --> 2400.96
on duty freemason

2399.839 --> 2404.72
like

2400.96 --> 2407.119
upholding a blatantly false narrative

2404.72 --> 2407.1189999999997
i mean

2407.359 --> 2411.119
unless

2408.88 --> 2412.96
and unless and that's weird you want to

2411.119 --> 2415.119
include veganism

2412.96 --> 2420.4
because i think veganism

2415.119 --> 2421.839
is secretly a freemason agenda as well

2420.4 --> 2423.6800000000003
that doesn't by the way make you

2421.839 --> 2424.88
automatically a freemason if you're a

2423.68 --> 2426.56
vegan

2424.88 --> 2429.04
but i get the feeling

2426.56 --> 2430.48
that they've ex pushed extra hard for

2429.04 --> 2434.0
that right

2430.48 --> 2434.0
it is mainstreaming

2434.64 --> 2440.0
but that doesn't mean that patricia is

2437.52 --> 2442.16
like oh she's an agent just to bring

2440.0 --> 2447.2
veganism i think that she might just

2442.16 --> 2447.2
genuinely be a vegan personally

2447.359 --> 2454.4
and she's just it's her personal passion

2449.76 --> 2457.119
again see it's it's complicated

2454.4 --> 2460.0
but yeah oh rv is not going to complain

2457.119 --> 2461.359
about that is he because he is

2460.0 --> 2466.64
a vegan

2461.359 --> 2468.7999999999997
oh yet another mark another mark

2466.64 --> 2471.44
right

2468.8 --> 2471.44
so yeah

2473.92 --> 2478.88
patricia is a

2475.52 --> 2480.96
really cool gal and she's always been a

2478.88 --> 2483.04
freedom of choice person

2480.96 --> 2485.2
like she's never gonna force anything on

2483.04 --> 2488.079
anybody and she even

2485.2 --> 2492.1189999999997
refrains from judging people for doing

2488.079 --> 2492.119
things that she doesn't like

2494.64 --> 2498.72
right

2495.68 --> 2500.64
so she's not she hasn't really been an

2498.72 --> 2503.2
active gatekeeper of any kind and that

2500.64 --> 2506.2
is kind of integral to being an active

2503.2 --> 2506.2
freemason

2510.72 --> 2514.0789999999997
right freemasons is tracked from the

2512.64 --> 2516.0
personal search for enlightenment

2514.079 --> 2518.079
absolutely that is what that comes down

2516.0 --> 2520.4
to that's why the fake narratives are

2518.079 --> 2523.119
there to distract to keep get you on

2520.4 --> 2525.04
that railroad away from personal

2523.119 --> 2527.76
reflection and enlightenment and

2525.04 --> 2530.4
patricia has been very much about

2527.76 --> 2531.28
personal development and reflection a

2530.4 --> 2536.44
lot

2531.28 --> 2536.44
i've enjoyed that super much

2543.359 --> 2548.4
right so see

2545.44 --> 2551.2000000000003
instead of just squirting over in

2548.4 --> 2553.28
fighting or accusations

2551.2 --> 2555.359
like what i do with the trolls in my

2553.28 --> 2557.6800000000003
chat sometimes

2555.359 --> 2561.5989999999997
i just analyze it

2557.68 --> 2563.44
i just analyze what is this really

2561.599 --> 2565.92
does he actually know what he's talking

2563.44 --> 2569.76
about when he's accusing people does he

2565.92 --> 2571.839
really know how to identify a freemason

2569.76 --> 2573.8390000000004
doesn't seem like it

2571.839 --> 2575.7599999999998
he's just going after the virtue

2573.839 --> 2578.319
signaling

2575.76 --> 2579.76
after the signaling the secret signaling

2578.319 --> 2583.2799999999997
[ __ ]

2579.76 --> 2585.44
that's nothing like what use is that

2583.28 --> 2586.96
somebody could be signaling all over the

2585.44 --> 2591.16
place

2586.96 --> 2591.16
and never do anything

2593.119 --> 2595.92
like

2594.079 --> 2597.599
if they don't have like a devious

2595.92 --> 2600.2400000000002
narrative or anything like how are they

2597.599 --> 2600.2400000000002
freemason

2600.64 --> 2603.92
maybe they're just

2602.16 --> 2607.2
like into the art

2603.92 --> 2609.119
they're like oh i like secret symbols

2607.2 --> 2611.4399999999996
and [ __ ]

2609.119 --> 2613.04
like i like that in art

2611.44 --> 2615.119
and so they go do that and then

2613.04 --> 2616.88
everybody oh my god look at this secret

2615.119 --> 2620.48
freemason symbol it's like yeah yeah

2616.88 --> 2622.2400000000002
yeah because he likes that you know that

2620.48 --> 2624.64
can be there too

2622.24 --> 2627.2799999999997
if he's not part of an organization

2624.64 --> 2628.64
being an active freemason

2627.28 --> 2631.52
which would imply

2628.64 --> 2634.48
rolling out a narrative of some sort and

2631.52 --> 2636.319
upholding that and gatekeeping it

2634.48 --> 2638.0
then yeah

2636.319 --> 2640.079
somebody could

2638.0 --> 2642.56
virtue signal all over the place with

2640.079 --> 2645.8390000000004
freemason symbols and it wouldn't do

2642.56 --> 2649.16
anything it wouldn't actually be proof

2645.839 --> 2649.16
their freemason

2658.24 --> 2660.72
right guns

2659.52 --> 2663.7599999999998
am i right

2660.72 --> 2665.7599999999998
i'm asking you guys too because this is

2663.76 --> 2668.0
what i think i've met

2665.76 --> 2669.6800000000003
some masons my grandfather was one i

2668.0 --> 2673.44
never met him

2669.68 --> 2676.44
but yeah i met people from his lodge

2673.44 --> 2676.44
and

2677.119 --> 2682.56
i think there is even like freemasons

2679.76 --> 2685.8390000000004
out there that are very much against

2682.56 --> 2686.64
lying in all forms and they they know

2685.839 --> 2688.96
that

2686.64 --> 2690.7999999999997
their organization is also involved in

2688.96 --> 2692.2400000000002
upholding up these lies and they don't

2690.8 --> 2694.4
like it and you don't want to be part of

2692.24 --> 2696.0789999999997
it so they stay out of it

2694.4 --> 2700.0
you see

2696.079 --> 2700.0
so i want to know guns of nephron

2701.04 --> 2705.2
am i correct with what i'm saying about

2703.76 --> 2706.96
masons

2705.2 --> 2708.8799999999997
is that correct i would really

2706.96 --> 2710.64
appreciate your input since you've just

2708.88 --> 2711.76
said that you've been around them for a

2710.64 --> 2716.5989999999997
long time

2711.76 --> 2716.599
am i correct in how i described it

2724.079 --> 2728.28
dave's extra land

2733.04 --> 2737.44
i'd be more worried about bill gates

2735.28 --> 2740.5600000000004
extra land

2737.44 --> 2742.16
like dude i want dave to have land that

2740.56 --> 2746.839
would be great

2742.16 --> 2746.839
like at least he's not gonna poison it

2754.88 --> 2759.88
the signaling is just a mocking system

2763.839 --> 2766.839
hmm

2777.28 --> 2780.4
it was not going to take over the world

2778.88 --> 2782.88
yeah but they never

2780.4 --> 2785.839
that's not what they do

2782.88 --> 2788.079
masons freemasons are not

2785.839 --> 2789.839
secret rulers

2788.079 --> 2794.0
they're not like

2789.839 --> 2794.0
the illuminati thing they are like

2795.119 --> 2800.56
the workers of the secret society

2798.8 --> 2804.079
they're not the rulers they're not the

2800.56 --> 2804.0789999999997
ones that like make

2804.56 --> 2810.0789999999997
massive decisions

2807.04 --> 2810.079
on how to proceed

2812.0 --> 2816.48
i mean they might get involved just to

2814.56 --> 2819.04
say like no we can't do that we still

2816.48 --> 2819.839
have this narrative going that

2819.04 --> 2824.0
but

2819.839 --> 2824.0
they're not the ones that really rule

2825.359 --> 2829.0789999999997
as far as i know

2832.96 --> 2836.56
maybe i'm wrong

2834.319 --> 2839.2799999999997
maybe there are like a formation class

2836.56 --> 2841.359
that does actually do that i haven't

2839.28 --> 2844.52
figured that part out yet if if that's

2841.359 --> 2844.52
the case

2848.319 --> 2851.319
mostly

2870.64 --> 2874.16
hello jeff gas head

2874.48 --> 2878.48
by the way

2875.76 --> 2880.8
yeah man time has flown

2878.48 --> 2883.359
but i wanted some feedback from you guys

2880.8 --> 2886.48
also about yesterday's show

2883.359 --> 2888.24
because i went after this

2886.48 --> 2890.72
guy

2888.24 --> 2892.9599999999996
was it red mood

2890.72 --> 2894.8799999999997
and i listened the whole thing back and

2892.96 --> 2897.119
i'm wondering like did i go too hard at

2894.88 --> 2897.119
him

2897.76 --> 2905.0400000000004
i i was being very accurate like i was

2901.76 --> 2906.559
like really analyzing that [ __ ]

2905.04 --> 2908.5589999999997
but

2906.559 --> 2912.119
i'm just hoping that i didn't really end

2908.559 --> 2912.119
up hurting him

2914.319 --> 2918.5589999999997
what do you guys think did i go too

2915.92 --> 2918.559
rough on him

2922.88 --> 2926.839
i didn't ban him or anything but he did

2924.64 --> 2931.2
just leave at some

2926.839 --> 2931.2
point was obviously triggered

2934.559 --> 2937.92
there's a master mason

2941.04 --> 2943.839
huh

2963.76 --> 2967.92
makes the world better well

2966.0 --> 2969.68
look the

2967.92 --> 2971.839
i think it might have something to do

2969.68 --> 2973.7599999999998
also with like a controlled opposition

2971.839 --> 2976.88
effect

2973.76 --> 2976.88
like they so

2976.96 --> 2981.839
the typical confusion

2979.359 --> 2982.839
to make sure nobody else

2981.839 --> 2986.5589999999997
does

2982.839 --> 2987.839
that in like a secret hostile takeover

2986.559 --> 2990.7200000000003
attempt

2987.839 --> 2992.839
basically maybe they like contribute in

2990.72 --> 2996.839
ways to preventing

2992.839 --> 3000.0
uncontrollable cult formations

2996.839 --> 3003.119
maybe or maybe they even help with

3000.0 --> 3005.52
forming them when they're like part of

3003.119 --> 3006.319
the plan to create that i don't know man

3005.52 --> 3007.68
it's

3006.319 --> 3009.839
getting a little out of my league

3007.68 --> 3012.839
perhaps

3009.839 --> 3012.839
uh

3037.119 --> 3041.0
guns is never own rp

3042.4 --> 3048.119
freudian slip there

3044.559 --> 3048.119
missing the knot

3054.4 --> 3057.839
what do you think about the nature of

3056.24 --> 3060.72
reality question

3057.839 --> 3064.44
the freemason hypnotized you into

3060.72 --> 3064.4399999999996
missing it what

3069.119 --> 3074.7200000000003
well

3070.88 --> 3074.7200000000003
yeah if you create stories

3075.44 --> 3080.319
that

3076.64 --> 3082.7999999999997
don't typically make yourself reflect

3080.319 --> 3085.2
then yeah that will stop that

3082.8 --> 3088.079
development process the personal inner

3085.2 --> 3090.72
reflection critical thinking

3088.079 --> 3092.96
and it will just make you memorize a

3090.72 --> 3094.319
narrative

3092.96 --> 3097.119
so

3094.319 --> 3099.599
you don't even have to like tinker tail

3097.119 --> 3102.079
or something to do that effect you just

3099.599 --> 3103.44
have to make up [ __ ] a narrative like a

3102.079 --> 3106.2400000000002
story

3103.44 --> 3109.599
like people addicted to

3106.24 --> 3111.839
novels that are obviously fiction not

3109.599 --> 3111.839
real

3112.88 --> 3116.8
effectively go through the same

3114.72 --> 3119.1189999999997
procedure because their mind is

3116.8 --> 3120.8
constantly at the fake story that they

3119.119 --> 3123.44
want to know more about

3120.8 --> 3125.3590000000004
now if they know it's a fake story but

3123.44 --> 3128.079
it still keeps pulling them in and

3125.359 --> 3130.16
thereby distracting them from just inner

3128.079 --> 3131.28
contemplation

3130.16 --> 3133.68
getting more

3131.28 --> 3136.6400000000003
right here right now who am i what am i

3133.68 --> 3136.64
doing is this right

3137.44 --> 3141.359
so it doesn't really matter whether it

3139.52 --> 3143.04
is a freemason

3141.359 --> 3145.68
on some media

3143.04 --> 3147.359
giving you or telling you about fake

3145.68 --> 3150.16
things or like oh

3147.359 --> 3152.7999999999997
secret alien invasion that's like

3150.16 --> 3153.839
obviously freemason creation in my

3152.8 --> 3157.04
opinion

3153.839 --> 3157.04
the whole alien thing

3160.64 --> 3164.4
so yeah whether you follow that or you

3162.96 --> 3166.96
like

3164.4 --> 3169.359
novels you like reading little fantasy

3166.96 --> 3171.76
books constantly

3169.359 --> 3174.0
that makes no difference because both

3171.76 --> 3175.3590000000004
things will distract you with the fake

3174.0 --> 3177.68
story

3175.359 --> 3179.839
from just

3177.68 --> 3181.839
focusing on yourself may that might be a

3179.839 --> 3183.92
little unpleasant right

3181.839 --> 3186.0789999999997
confronting yourself focusing just

3183.92 --> 3188.96
listening to the silence and then yo

3186.079 --> 3190.2400000000002
convenient distractions

3188.96 --> 3193.2
so yeah

3190.24 --> 3195.68
it's like almost like if they feel a

3193.2 --> 3197.7599999999998
distraction market

3195.68 --> 3200.3999999999996
in their own way but they do it

3197.76 --> 3200.4
tactically

3200.72 --> 3206.64
they're not just short-term

3203.52 --> 3209.28
like fiction

3206.64 --> 3211.2
conceivers or anything writers they they

3209.28 --> 3212.7200000000003
build with their

3211.2 --> 3215.4399999999996
narratives

3212.72 --> 3218.24
they're much more constructive with the

3215.44 --> 3220.48
with the with the narratives

3218.24 --> 3222.64
like bigger picture type narratives

3220.48 --> 3224.16
right that's kind of the trademark

3222.64 --> 3226.319
in the whole thing

3224.16 --> 3230.24
it has to connect to everything else so

3226.319 --> 3230.24
that you can actually think it's real

3230.559 --> 3233.559
anyway

3252.96 --> 3257.16
i'll just show you

3290.839 --> 3295.52
dude you have that

3293.52 --> 3298.319
10 minutes to delay you kept myself from

3295.52 --> 3298.319
the last few minutes

3299.359 --> 3302.72
the internet connect is so long

3303.119 --> 3306.28
all right

3306.799 --> 3311.04
i just hurt myself back from the last

3308.88 --> 3313.52
two minutes through his mobile

3311.04 --> 3313.52
it's fine

3314.559 --> 3319.559
right

3315.52 --> 3319.559
so we've got five more minutes

3328.88 --> 3333.52
masons are like any other society they

3331.359 --> 3335.5989999999997
are bad apples i think you meant to say

3333.52 --> 3338.599
they have bad apples right guns and

3335.599 --> 3338.599
everyone

3348.64 --> 3353.2
oh

3349.44 --> 3353.2000000000003
skinny bear leaving

3361.44 --> 3364.7200000000003
all right yeah see you later woodworking

3363.359 --> 3369.24
gunny bear thanks for being there in

3364.72 --> 3369.24
chat it's pretty good chat

3402.24 --> 3406.3999999999996
right we would all be dead if masons

3404.24 --> 3408.72
were actually evil over

3406.4 --> 3409.92
overlords

3408.72 --> 3412.0
overloads

3409.92 --> 3414.0
you seem to be having some typing issues

3412.0 --> 3415.28
today against everyone

3414.0 --> 3418.0
that's okay

3415.28 --> 3420.96
yeah but yeah

3418.0 --> 3424.799
it would end quickly

3420.96 --> 3424.799
if they were systematically evil

3425.599 --> 3428.079
and it

3428.4 --> 3433.04
well it would also be much more

3430.079 --> 3435.52
problematic in general because then

3433.04 --> 3438.319
like every family that is freemason

3435.52 --> 3441.2
would just like grow super dark

3438.319 --> 3444.319
if it was that evil

3441.2 --> 3447.4399999999996
like not just like

3444.319 --> 3449.2
had issues or like dubious moral people

3447.44 --> 3452.2400000000002
in the family but like it would go

3449.2 --> 3452.24
really [ __ ] up

3455.119 --> 3460.4
and hey there's a lot of masons out

3457.44 --> 3462.96
there so that means a whole bunch of

3460.4 --> 3464.079
like super dark hassle that's not

3462.96 --> 3466.079
happening

3464.079 --> 3469.28
thank god

3466.079 --> 3471.52
so yeah in in my view the masons have

3469.28 --> 3474.0
always been kind of a

3471.52 --> 3476.48
morally neutral organization that's not

3474.0 --> 3477.68
amoral it's just

3476.48 --> 3479.28
yeah

3477.68 --> 3481.2
there's some pretty good people in there

3479.28 --> 3482.7200000000003
and there's some kind of messed up

3481.2 --> 3484.24
people in there

3482.72 --> 3486.0789999999997
and there's people in there that are

3484.24 --> 3488.64
just like now

3486.079 --> 3490.079
we're just using the connections and

3488.64 --> 3491.7599999999998
neutral and

3490.079 --> 3493.119
so

3491.76 --> 3496.2400000000002
yeah

3493.119 --> 3496.2400000000002
it's very broad

3499.68 --> 3505.7599999999998
wonder if there's a public statistic for

3502.079 --> 3509.6400000000003
mason suicides what

3505.76 --> 3509.6400000000003
that's a creepy question

3518.48 --> 3522.119
hello jim west

3535.52 --> 3539.92
all right i'm gonna run out the show by

3537.44 --> 3539.92
the way guys

3540.079 --> 3546.0

3544.079 --> 3549.44
but tomorrow i'll be back with another

3546.0 --> 3549.44
just full two-hour show

3550.24 --> 3554.64
it's not just because of me isn't it

3553.68 --> 3556.319
i hope

3554.64 --> 3559.7599999999998
it's because of

3556.319 --> 3561.04
having to get up really early suddenly

3559.76 --> 3563.2000000000003
that's fine

3561.04 --> 3565.04
dude i'm happy you're here man

3563.2 --> 3566.8799999999997

3565.04 --> 3567.7599999999998
don't worry about it

3566.88 --> 3571.28
right

3567.76 --> 3572.7990000000004
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

3571.28 --> 3574.2400000000002
like this show even though it was a

3572.799 --> 3576.0
little short

3574.24 --> 3577.7599999999998
it's an interesting conversation about

3576.0 --> 3579.92
