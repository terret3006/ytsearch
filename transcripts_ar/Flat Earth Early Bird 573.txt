warm

and hey I don't see all that haze up

129.739 --> 134.209
there in the sky either remember

131.45 --> 138.89
yesterday there was a lot of haze now

134.209 --> 141.28
there's this one piece right there but I

138.89 --> 159.04899999999998
don't know it the majority seems to be

141.28 --> 161.17000000000002
cleared up so today I'm gonna got green

159.049 --> 164.75
tea with me

161.17 --> 169.94
that's warm enough it should be careful

164.75 --> 174.44
with the coffee when it's this warm so

169.94 --> 176.75
anyway let's see who is in chat today hm

174.44 --> 185.98
was first heat seems to be first a lot

176.75 --> 185.98
these days I'm and a young morning dank

187.629 --> 203.07899999999998
Steve / moco Missouri Bear said eat that

198.609 --> 207.37
Cosentino hello Neil random Explorer

203.079 --> 209.40900000000002
good to see you again you know what for

207.37 --> 212.37
now after yesterday I'm gonna give you a

209.409 --> 222.60899999999998
wrench let's see if you're worth it

212.37 --> 223.239
um haba Robin Stanley yeah good to see

222.609 --> 227.65
you all

223.239 --> 230.31
huh quite a full chat on the other hand

227.65 --> 230.31
it is Friday

233.189 --> 240.219
yeah yesterday's Flat Earth debate was

235.75 --> 243.519
really good there's a new rumpus on the

240.219 --> 247.329
scene it seems because this guy you know

243.519 --> 251.62
was more of an Austrian accent find me

247.329 --> 256.419
yeah or Austrian German Germanic and he

251.62 --> 258.549
was like step by step following the

256.419 --> 263.349
exact Trampas method and he had the same

258.549 --> 266.979
energy so it was like wow this is this

263.349 --> 269.889
is the second rumpus somebody's like

266.979 --> 271.449
copied his method stepping up I don't

269.889 --> 274.18
know how long he's gonna hold out though

271.449 --> 279.699
you know the rumpus is doing it for like

274.18 --> 285.07
years now almost seemingly tiresome at

279.699 --> 288.87
tirelessness or what is it tire and

285.07 --> 288.87
Leslie that's the word I'm looking for

289.81 --> 296.14
let's see how long this guy is gonna

291.52 --> 298.39
hold out so yeah that should be an

296.14 --> 300.75
interesting Flat Earth debate for the

298.39 --> 300.75
weekend

303.33 --> 308.82
right I actually made some notes this

305.95 --> 312.03999999999996
time I did it though this morning

308.82 --> 314.05
because yeah I've watched the I was up

312.04 --> 318.37
pretty early as I went bad pretty early

314.05 --> 321.73
uh yeah I really like it I really like

318.37 --> 324.31
this way yeah I like my rhythm you know

321.73 --> 328.87
it's not all good but today even I

324.31 --> 332.71
wasn't nauseated so it's like yeah those

328.87 --> 338.95
are the days when I do much more I get

332.71 --> 340.96
so much more active right

338.95 --> 344.46999999999997
yesterday was basically Flat Earth

340.96 --> 347.82
debates went on very long and then Owen

344.47 --> 350.38000000000005
Benjamin which was yet great

347.82 --> 353.38
although connection issues again but

350.38 --> 357.34
yeah it's it was a great stream when I

353.38 --> 360.76
got to follow and then unexpectedly John

357.34 --> 362.83
Dee called me on over Skype I don't know

360.76 --> 366.28
where I was already a little bit drunk

362.83 --> 372.34
but didn't matter doesn't doesn't matter

366.28 --> 376.96
like he was very cure for wordid by Adam

372.34 --> 379.98999999999995
eking of all people concerning ya my

376.96 --> 386.79999999999995
research or my insights on light and

379.99 --> 389.29
it's just really honored that yeah that

386.8 --> 391.51
had a meeting would point him to me and

389.29 --> 394.42
I did my best at a great conversation

391.51 --> 397.65999999999997
very long put down all the points all

394.42 --> 400.03000000000003
the issues and this is going to be

397.66 --> 402.88000000000005
interesting I'm very curious what to see

400.03 --> 406.69
what's gonna come out of this because

402.88 --> 411.15999999999997
John Dee got my points and he recognized

406.69 --> 412.57
like my honest approach and all that and

411.16 --> 417.33000000000004
it was great are you by the way hello

412.57 --> 417.33
over Jay Alex aleykum

421.07 --> 426.78
you got a space commercial before coming

423.81 --> 428.759
here well that's not surprising I get a

426.78 --> 433.13
lot of cooking commercials for some

428.759 --> 433.13
reason the same ones every time

439.08 --> 444.389
maybe it's trying to appeal to my

441.389 --> 447.479
singleness by consciously shoving woman

444.389 --> 454.31
women in kitchens in my face I don't

447.479 --> 454.31
know what it is I don't mind

462.059 --> 467.519
I'll point assume is that so well I

464.399 --> 470.909
don't really care I just care for

467.519 --> 473.369
people's quality of work and if they use

470.909 --> 478.99899999999997
some kind of badge or an accomplishment

473.369 --> 482.48900000000003
or a paper like the wording of it I

478.999 --> 488.459
don't like that in general people do

482.489 --> 491.87899999999996
that a lot I don't do it I you know if

488.459 --> 495.059
they literally use the content of that

491.879 --> 497.759
properly like off that badge properly

495.059 --> 500.759
and responsibly and really shape their

497.759 --> 504.29900000000004
entire way of reasoning and talking to

500.759 --> 507.029
that specifically in a good way in a

504.299 --> 509.969
hopefully somewhat flexible way so that

507.029 --> 512.579
they can actually keep on building then

509.969 --> 516.36
that's another matter but if people just

512.579 --> 518.2189999999999
use PhDs or whatever to slap somebody in

516.36 --> 519.479
the face with and like oh I'm better

518.219 --> 527.73
than you because of that

519.479 --> 530.8190000000001
yeah that's completely useless in my

527.73 --> 533.189
opinion but then again I'm kind of

530.819 --> 540.62
biased since I don't have a lot of

533.189 --> 540.62
papers I only have my words

542.13 --> 550.07
and my trains of thought and my code of

545.37 --> 550.07
conduct that's all I have to present

551.45 --> 554.599
[Music]

557.56 --> 565.959
at blocker no no don't that blocker is

563.259 --> 568.8100000000001
not good for me

565.959 --> 572.9989999999999
because I use advertisements and hey

568.81 --> 576.79
it's it's a bit of a nuisance I know but

572.999 --> 579.49
yeah what is being shoved in people's

576.79 --> 582.43
faces through these as can some can

579.49 --> 587.769
sometimes be halfway interesting because

582.43 --> 589.6289999999999
of how just from the perspective of

587.769 --> 591.819
wanting to know like how they're trying

589.629 --> 593.62
to influence you alone it's kind of

591.819 --> 595.12
interesting to do that now it's not

593.62 --> 597.189
gonna be fun if you're gonna watch like

595.12 --> 599.379
a three-hour video and it's gonna have

597.189 --> 600.9989999999999
an advertisement every 10 minutes yeah

599.379 --> 603.009
that's gonna get really freaking

600.999 --> 606.339
annoying because you're gonna get

603.009 --> 611.62
interrupted constantly but yeah ad

606.339 --> 613.72
blocker takes away the yeah the revenue

611.62 --> 618.519
stream that also contributes to my

613.72 --> 620.1700000000001
channel and the stats so yeah if you you

618.519 --> 623.589
look okay I'm not gonna stop you if

620.17 --> 628.36
you're gonna do it but I'm asking you to

623.589 --> 633.25
please don't that is all and I hope that

628.36 --> 636.61
my advertisement placement is reasonable

633.25 --> 638.5
I don't do it manually a lot because

636.61 --> 640.9590000000001
it's a much more difficult process to do

638.5 --> 642.689
now than it used to be with the the new

640.959 --> 645.6389999999999
editor to me

642.689 --> 649.059
but even then I always had a standard

645.639 --> 652.949
policy like after 10 minutes and then

649.059 --> 656.23
every 30 minutes after that I think

652.949 --> 658.649
right no every 20 minutes was it every

656.23 --> 658.649
30 minutes

662.3 --> 669.9799999999999
I'm not sure now anyway doesn't really

665.84 --> 671.99
matter I try to space it enough and

669.98 --> 678.35
recently you're probably only going to

671.99 --> 680.84
have starting ads anyway I think I got

678.35 --> 682.58
already a substantial amount of videos

680.84 --> 686.36
with advertisements that are just

682.58 --> 689.6600000000001
running and it does actually like

686.36 --> 693.7
accumulate the more things I have that

689.66 --> 693.6999999999999
are running after that it does work

698.65 --> 705.12
for me that is anyway let's get back to

705.45 --> 711.1600000000001
to the subject yeah so the call from

708.91 --> 713.1999999999999
John Dee that was very interesting very

711.16 --> 716.4699999999999
curious to see where that's gonna go I

713.2 --> 722.5
hope to be updated about that because I

716.47 --> 725.8000000000001
have much more to talk about you to

722.5 --> 729.76
premiums no ads and that created will

725.8 --> 732.88
still benefit good that's that sounds

729.76 --> 736.27
good I have actually considered also

732.88 --> 739.15
becoming or taking YouTube premium

736.27 --> 741.67
myself because apparently you can also

739.15 --> 744.13
easily download videos that way and that

741.67 --> 748.5
that's that would be very handy because

744.13 --> 752.77
currently I don't have any way to

748.5 --> 755.35
extract videos from YouTube anymore it's

752.77 --> 760.0
like the system's just broken down that

755.35 --> 762.7
I used to use for that but we'll see if

760.0 --> 768.27
I'm gonna do that or not it's not on my

762.7 --> 772.84
priority list currently anyway right so

768.27 --> 775.09
this morning also I saw two videos one

772.84 --> 780.3100000000001
was posted by paul hall in the

775.09 --> 785.32
ball-busters chat it's a video of dr.

780.31 --> 787.2099999999999
james tour I was actually studied yeah

785.32 --> 789.49
like it you could hear it

787.21 --> 792.61
later his presentation like he's a super

789.49 --> 794.89
heavy studied microbiologist and he

792.61 --> 799.1800000000001
really put down the presentation that

794.89 --> 802.24
was just a high level so I posted it in

799.18 --> 805.0899999999999
the chat earlier I recommend everybody

802.24 --> 808.3
watch that video at least once very

805.09 --> 811.69
enlightening and he basically puts down

808.3 --> 817.14
a very strong case as to the design and

811.69 --> 820.6
how without the information it cannot

817.14 --> 824.05
form even on the genetic level not not

820.6 --> 827.46
just suppose it adaptational all that

824.05 --> 827.4599999999999
but it was really

827.71 --> 836.95
yeah it was great it was at a grade

831.52 --> 839.86
level there was that

836.95 --> 841.12
and then there was not a video from New

839.86 --> 843.37
Earth who I do

841.12 --> 846.55
check out sometimes it gets a little

843.37 --> 850.0
weird over there but in a way that I can

846.55 --> 854.76
still follow it especially when there is

850.0 --> 860.529
like like religious traditions kind of

854.76 --> 864.1899999999999
phase into the explanations it gets a

860.529 --> 866.1899999999999
little complicated but that way I was a

864.19 --> 872.08
video with a lot of Vedic lore and

866.19 --> 877.3900000000001
predictions and from from the old Fettig

872.08 --> 882.279
Lords from India and cockhead from the

877.39 --> 884.38
kokis cuz they're a Caucasian apparently

882.279 --> 886.5889999999999
they're yeah but is that gonna be

884.38 --> 890.4399999999999
Bulgaria or something like that anyway

886.589 --> 894.0100000000001
yeah she's throwing a lot of stuff at me

890.44 --> 896.35
that I never really even took a look at

894.01 --> 898.45
before interesting and there's

896.35 --> 901.2090000000001
apparently a whole chain of predictions

898.45 --> 904.4200000000001
going on that she was waving through and

901.209 --> 907.77
just reflecting upon including that

904.42 --> 911.77
there would be multiple Christ's coming

907.77 --> 915.1899999999999
it's like what and also an interesting

911.77 --> 918.75
perspective which which I think I've

915.19 --> 923.1400000000001
heard that before but like that even

918.75 --> 928.51
there were three Christ's that were like

923.14 --> 930.97
all separate people that had that yeah I

928.51 --> 933.3389999999999
don't know you'd have to hear it it was

930.97 --> 939.25
I know it was something else

933.339 --> 942.2790000000001
it was quite fascinating to hear and I'm

939.25 --> 945.49
not like adapting my entire Padian to

942.279 --> 946.63
all that I would have to hear a little

945.49 --> 949.3290000000001
bit more about it

946.63 --> 953.67
before I can make up my mind but it was

949.329 --> 953.67
very fascinating at least I thought

957.06 --> 963.06
that's Nathan ever now the Missouri bear

960.16 --> 967.66
Nathan is not the guy really to seek

963.06 --> 970.3599999999999
contact with organizations he kind of

967.66 --> 972.66
waits until they contact him that's how

970.36 --> 981.96
he got that thing with Vice as well

972.66 --> 985.54
remember so he doesn't really reach out

981.96 --> 986.85
to engage with things too much but he's

985.54 --> 988.7199999999999
available

986.85 --> 992.74
who then well there's other

988.72 --> 996.0400000000001
flat-earthers that do that I think Tony

992.74 --> 1001.8
has has dabbled in doing that kind of

996.04 --> 1007.4399999999999
thing a little and Nathan Thompson does

1001.8 --> 1009.87
that sort of thing for sure yeah but

1007.44 --> 1013.08
those are just the ones that pop off pop

1009.87 --> 1016.5600000000001
up at the top of my mind there's gonna

1013.08 --> 1024.18
be more I personally haven't really done

1016.56 --> 1026.4589999999998
that but that's also because yeah in the

1024.18 --> 1029.8500000000001
Netherlands I wouldn't really know how

1026.459 --> 1032.76
to approach that unless I knew more

1029.85 --> 1036.75
Dutch people that have had their own

1032.76 --> 1040.73
tries because all my research oh my

1036.75 --> 1040.73
contacts are all over the Internet

1041.39 --> 1049.5200000000002
they're all English and American and

1045.65 --> 1052.02
Australian New Zealand and all that and

1049.52 --> 1054.48
and now I know there's a couple of Dutch

1052.02 --> 1058.05
guys that at least like hang around in

1054.48 --> 1060.08
my chat but I haven't ever met them in

1058.05 --> 1060.08
person

1063.08 --> 1067.86
I'm kind of open to meat but I'm not

1066.0 --> 1069.45
going to be like traveling somewhere

1067.86 --> 1072.75
else because that's very inconvenient

1069.45 --> 1075.179
for me cost me money you have to wear

1072.75 --> 1078.59
the stupid mask now I know I don't have

1075.179 --> 1078.5900000000001
a car so

1083.43 --> 1088.92
that you guys partake in Amsterdam

1085.86 --> 1092.6599999999999
that's you mean the Amsterdam conference

1088.92 --> 1092.66
yes I was there

1094.94 --> 1102.68
photographed and everything also met

1100.47 --> 1108.71
Nathan Oakley there by the waiting

1102.68 --> 1108.71
he gave Randy Randy scam to me

1111.71 --> 1115.92
[Music]

1119.419 --> 1126.0790000000002
and I did meet a couple of Dutch

1121.879 --> 1130.57
flat-earthers they're cool guys but

1126.079 --> 1130.57
they're not really like media people

1138.87 --> 1146.31
although there should be like guys out

1141.48 --> 1148.5
there that do have shows in Dutch but I

1146.31 --> 1150.75
don't know if there's like really more

1148.5 --> 1153.95
dedicated that there would have Flat

1150.75 --> 1156.9
Earth in the title or the plots I heart

1153.95 --> 1158.4
like I know people upload videos about

1156.9 --> 1162.66
that but there's not like a live show

1158.4 --> 1167.16
going something like the Flat Earth

1162.66 --> 1171.14
debate is or my show not that I've at

1167.16 --> 1171.14
least bumped into as of yet

1184.45 --> 1187.96
challenging their [ __ ] oh you're

1186.46 --> 1190.51
gonna look for trouble are you Missouri

1187.96 --> 1193.2
bear I'm sure they're gonna be very

1190.51 --> 1193.2
happy with you

1197.4 --> 1204.69
that it me person I wouldn't really go

1200.49 --> 1208.07
out poking physicists at universities

1204.69 --> 1211.56
necessarily unless they like recently

1208.07 --> 1213.99
bragged about so yeah I think some

1211.56 --> 1216.54
obviously fake thing accomplished or

1213.99 --> 1218.55
something you know then I'd go after

1216.54 --> 1220.74
that because then you have a reason like

1218.55 --> 1223.1399999999999
yeah you did this it's [ __ ] yeah

1220.74 --> 1226.79
yeah but just going there to just poke

1223.14 --> 1226.7900000000002
around that seems a little weird

1228.29 --> 1233.61
Dutch need to be informed in their own

1231.09 --> 1236.58
language well it's very tough because

1233.61 --> 1239.9099999999999
the Dutch mode a lot of Dutch have been

1236.58 --> 1242.6299999999999
very programmed for a very long time

1239.91 --> 1247.67
there's this whole way of speaking

1242.63 --> 1250.5900000000001
that's kind of like taking this virtual

1247.67 --> 1255.0800000000002
Authority position almost culturally

1250.59 --> 1255.08
it's weird they do it in media a lot

1260.4 --> 1266.67
physicists never brag oh really I

1263.46 --> 1266.67
wouldn't know

1274.08 --> 1281.73
right but hey Shay I am very willing to

1277.38 --> 1284.73
try but I I'm not it's not just gonna be

1281.73 --> 1288.09
freakin Arwen okay I'm not gonna do that

1284.73 --> 1290.28
on my own I need people I need people

1288.09 --> 1292.1699999999998
that are more knowledgeable in dealing

1290.28 --> 1295.44
with Dutch people than I am because I'm

1292.17 --> 1298.92
not this I've really isolated for a

1295.44 --> 1303.06
Dutch person really it's like almost

1298.92 --> 1305.43
unheard of in a way but it's not a heron

1303.06 --> 1308.46
heard of but like people that usually

1305.43 --> 1311.28
are as isolated as I am socially have

1308.46 --> 1314.91
like so much trouble psychologically and

1311.28 --> 1315.81
[ __ ] that yeah people stay away from

1314.91 --> 1318.72
them anyway

1315.81 --> 1324.81
know that but I'm not like that thank

1318.72 --> 1331.56
God I never let it slide like that I see

1324.81 --> 1333.96
my lack of social connectivity as my

1331.56 --> 1336.27
problem it's not as something that I

1333.96 --> 1339.6000000000001
blame society for although yes Society

1336.27 --> 1342.33
didn't exactly make it easy for me in a

1339.6 --> 1349.32
way that's how I see it anyway

1342.33 --> 1350.8799999999999
yeah let's connect Rocher if I'm gonna

1349.32 --> 1354.24
be doing some kind of flat earth

1350.88 --> 1357.0300000000002
speaking life stream project with

1354.24 --> 1359.46
interviews and all that it's not just

1357.03 --> 1362.31
gonna be me doing everything and then I

1359.46 --> 1363.44
want a team that can that'll actually

1362.31 --> 1365.61
assist me

1363.44 --> 1368.25
that'll figure things out for me that

1365.61 --> 1370.55
knows how to search the right things and

1368.25 --> 1370.55
all that

1375.53 --> 1382.37
and who knows what projects other people

1379.1 --> 1385.49
can get together head on to do it on to

1382.37 --> 1388.55
it and I don't know it could be like a

1385.49 --> 1393.08
season thing that we just do a season

1388.55 --> 1396.05
maybe because like starting out a daily

1393.08 --> 1398.3899999999999
show in Dutch well that's gonna then get

1396.05 --> 1402.44
in the way of the earlybird like I'm not

1398.39 --> 1405.38
gonna do two shows every day that's no

1402.44 --> 1409.5800000000002
way maybe in 20 years or something if

1405.38 --> 1415.2700000000002
this is all still going down no but my

1409.58 --> 1415.27
condition so yeah I don't know

1416.68 --> 1423.3200000000002
I'll not just close too many doors just

1420.32 --> 1426.26
yet before even seeing what any offer

1423.32 --> 1428.6299999999999
might be I'm at work now so let's

1426.26 --> 1431.03
discuss in the weekends all right I have

1428.63 --> 1437.96
this card right you have my discord good

1431.03 --> 1440.81
sure and I'm especially just very

1437.96 --> 1442.7
curious to see what the animal is like

1440.81 --> 1445.49
the flat earthers what is their ages

1442.7 --> 1451.97
what are what types are they what type

1445.49 --> 1455.51
of people are they because I the few

1451.97 --> 1461.1100000000001
that I've met were good people like they

1455.51 --> 1461.11
were yeah genuinely good people

1469.56 --> 1473.8799999999999
so I don't know if it's gonna be a big

1471.69 --> 1477.0900000000001
crowd if it's gonna be almost like a

1473.88 --> 1479.3700000000001
gang almost like the flat earthers with

1477.09 --> 1485.1599999999999
the English crowd and all that I don't

1479.37 --> 1487.6499999999999
know what's out there really because I

1485.16 --> 1490.8000000000002
don't go on like Dutch social media I

1487.65 --> 1492.5700000000002
don't have like Facebook friends circles

1490.8 --> 1494.22
oh and I know it's all going on I see

1492.57 --> 1499.32
people on their mobiles like all day

1494.22 --> 1502.77
long so I just have avoided it I avoided

1499.32 --> 1504.75
it on purpose very early on it I saw

1502.77 --> 1508.56
like this is not good this is not what I

1504.75 --> 1511.05
want I want to be with people that will

1508.56 --> 1514.3799999999999
have a habit of just looking each other

1511.05 --> 1516.6499999999999
in the eye that really pay attention to

1514.38 --> 1519.5300000000002
where people are at and not just

1516.65 --> 1523.4
constantly escape in the freaking phone

1519.53 --> 1524.42
this is just something I refuse I refuse

1523.4 --> 1527.529
that

1524.42 --> 1527.529
[Music]

1532.69 --> 1539.77
seeking star water I will help in any

1534.98 --> 1539.77
way I can out Arwen okay cool

1541.57 --> 1545.5
wait are you Dutch too

1548.44 --> 1553.45
I'm not sure what you're talking about

1550.89 --> 1556.1100000000001
but anyway appreciate the sentiment

1553.45 --> 1556.1100000000001
nonetheless

1565.12 --> 1569.639
call me one you mean over mu

1572.89 --> 1576.039
[Music]

1577.33 --> 1583.48
but so into language oh so you wanna

1580.09 --> 1587.1689999999999
tune into the Dutch spoken versions

1583.48 --> 1590.1100000000001
alright Dutch is very difficult language

1587.169 --> 1596.95
to follow but sure you're always welcome

1590.11 --> 1601.4799999999998
to to listen and all that and you know

1596.95 --> 1603.999
technically if it was like the show

1601.48 --> 1606.94
setting would be plenty scripted that I

1603.999 --> 1609.249
would yeah I get plenty of like written

1606.94 --> 1613.529
down assistance and all that reminders

1609.249 --> 1616.749
then I could even focus on doing it

1613.529 --> 1620.32
spoken English and then spoken Dutch and

1616.749 --> 1626.3500000000001
then like do everything dual language I

1620.32 --> 1627.999
can do that take some training at first

1626.35 --> 1630.84
might stumble a couple of times but I

1627.999 --> 1635.2
would get very good at it because I've

1630.84 --> 1637.2099999999998
done that in the past you know I've

1635.2 --> 1639.159
talked with a lot of English people even

1637.21 --> 1641.739
when I was really young I tried you know

1639.159 --> 1644.259
like the alternative is just not really

1641.739 --> 1646.809
talk and just screw around whatever you

1644.259 --> 1649.09
doing on the pictures or something

1646.809 --> 1651.609
but no I try to engage in speaking

1649.09 --> 1654.6999999999998
English very young because I really

1651.609 --> 1658.289
wanted to know I wanted to talk that

1654.7 --> 1663.19
language of Optimus Prime you'll hear me

1658.289 --> 1665.999
yeah that's basically what it was or how

1663.19 --> 1665.999
it started out

1669.369 --> 1674.619
so on touch one English house sure why

1673.609 --> 1677.749
not

1674.619 --> 1680.32
but I think that it would be best to

1677.749 --> 1684.409
stick to Dutch because there is a lot of

1680.32 --> 1687.259
complicated social intricacies that are

1684.409 --> 1689.2990000000002
involved in in Dutch speaking with Dutch

1687.259 --> 1691.669
it's different there's like this

1689.299 --> 1693.769
different energy level to it and if it's

1691.669 --> 1697.5490000000002
going to constantly do a language then

1693.769 --> 1699.879
some of that energy will become diffused

1697.549 --> 1699.879
so

1710.24 --> 1712.9
all right

1713.74 --> 1720.85
what could also work is just having

1716.11 --> 1724.33
English subtitles and our Dutch people

1720.85 --> 1726.61
can be very good at doing that and much

1724.33 --> 1729.09
better than any automated translator

1726.61 --> 1729.09
will do it

1739.25 --> 1748.37
you know Star Wars game for VR oh dear

1743.86 --> 1750.05
there it goes the stomach yeah it's

1748.37 --> 1754.9099999999999
probably gonna look awesome but it's

1750.05 --> 1757.49
also good yeah VR you know it's not

1754.91 --> 1760.3400000000001
gonna work for me I'll probably be in

1757.49 --> 1763.88
there and like yeah yeah that's so

1760.34 --> 1774.35
awesome I'm in space I'm Spacek after

1763.88 --> 1779.0600000000002
five minutes I get to the bathroom yeah

1774.35 --> 1782.54
it's not gonna work I think for me a

1779.06 --> 1786.5
proper space type game would work better

1782.54 --> 1789.29
if it was just like a room of screens

1786.5 --> 1791.42
more like the classic emulator setup

1789.29 --> 1795.77
that you're just sitting in a chair and

1791.42 --> 1798.47
their screens like everywhere so your 3d

1795.77 --> 1802.37
immerse not a thing on my head where

1798.47 --> 1805.06
it's gonna screw with my perspective you

1802.37 --> 1805.06
don't need that

1808.93 --> 1814.18
I always liked those even though are the

1811.57 --> 1817.09
basic arcade things of just a a chair

1814.18 --> 1821.13
thing and then there's a screen there

1817.09 --> 1821.1299999999999
that already was pretty awesome to me

1824.43 --> 1829.93
all right

1825.61 --> 1832.4799999999998
John John Mac well I I get 3d sick look

1829.93 --> 1836.5600000000002
[ __ ] now that I'm thinking about it

1832.48 --> 1839.38
suddenly hit me thinking back again and

1836.56 --> 1844.21
that was in 2010 or something half-life

1839.38 --> 1846.16
2 God like that 3d was so realistic like

1844.21 --> 1850.48
the mirror of the water and all that it

1846.16 --> 1854.3200000000002
was so unbelievably real looking that it

1850.48 --> 1856.42
made me sick a lot very quickly and

1854.32 --> 1859.59
after that I just stopped playing 3d

1856.42 --> 1863.8600000000001
games I just stopped it and I couldn't

1859.59 --> 1866.53
couldn't deal with it it's not fun if

1863.86 --> 1869.7099999999998
you're literally sick all the time you

1866.53 --> 1875.5
know so I'm not even gonna try 3d I had

1869.71 --> 1879.58
a friend that had that was again oculus

1875.5 --> 1883.93
an earlier version and yeah that too was

1879.58 --> 1887.11
just yeah make me feel it'll very

1883.93 --> 1889.0800000000002
quickly and it looked very pixelated but

1887.11 --> 1891.31
they probably got that better now

1889.08 --> 1893.4399999999998
resolution is probably better now but

1891.31 --> 1895.95
still yeah it's the same problem with

1893.44 --> 1895.95
the 3d

1914.11 --> 1921.2099999999998
you know what I'm thinking about now I

1917.19 --> 1924.13
don't know man

1921.21 --> 1926.1100000000001
but I could literally be handing the

1924.13 --> 1927.8200000000002
industry like a new idea that they'll

1926.11 --> 1931.03
just take because I'm never gonna be

1927.82 --> 1936.1499999999999
able to get this done but you could

1931.03 --> 1940.83
almost like make a half way ride

1936.15 --> 1945.3700000000001
you know like in theme parks and then

1940.83 --> 1949.54
space simulator and the right like you

1945.37 --> 1953.32
could be part of a Star Trek team where

1949.54 --> 1955.4189999999999
there's like yeah screens everywhere and

1953.32 --> 1957.309
potential physical things like I think

1955.419 --> 1966.3000000000002
I've seen that kind of thing before by

1957.309 --> 1972.57
the way what oh [ __ ]

1966.3 --> 1975.43
either that already exists vision but

1972.57 --> 1978.28
yeah that would be very much preferable

1975.43 --> 1982.92
than having some 3d thing on your head

1978.28 --> 1982.92
like that for me

1993.42 --> 1997.5900000000001
I should simulate a real spinning boerth

1996.03 --> 2004.49
where you have to survive the

1997.59 --> 2010.3
catastrophe well there are probably like

2004.49 --> 2015.24
Armageddon simulators - as like a ride

2010.3 --> 2016.75
or a room where you're standing in I

2015.24 --> 2019.85
[Music]

2016.75 --> 2026.93
don't know when the theme parks it's a

2019.85 --> 2028.2199999999998
it's a little silly it does exist yeah

2026.93 --> 2031.8200000000002
it could be it could be that I've

2028.22 --> 2036.2
actually seen it on a video like a long

2031.82 --> 2038.54
time ago maybe even ten years ago or it

2036.2 --> 2044.39
like National Geographic in some theme

2038.54 --> 2046.19
park based program or something but I

2044.39 --> 2050.9900000000002
thought that that thing was actually

2046.19 --> 2053.15
kind of really cool like it's really new

2050.99 --> 2054.6789999999996
and I don't know maybe a lot of people

2053.15 --> 2057.61
wouldn't like it but I thought it was a

2054.679 --> 2057.61
really cool idea

2066.34 --> 2070.63
now but you can't create as a true

2068.98 --> 2073.48
simulation of the spinning earth

2070.63 --> 2078.4300000000003
Missouri bear you could be try to build

2073.48 --> 2084.07
a physics engine that is like incredibly

2078.43 --> 2088.18
powerful and then try to simulate like

2084.07 --> 2092.34
basically set forces set material all

2088.18 --> 2100.24
that and just let it move in some yeah

2092.34 --> 2103.42
3d rendered thing but yeah those things

2100.24 --> 2105.9399999999996
might already exist and of course they

2103.42 --> 2108.33
don't work first thing that's going to

2105.94 --> 2111.66
happen is that all the gas is going to

2108.33 --> 2111.66
explode away

2118.28 --> 2123.0890000000004
so yeah it's very nice idea of Missouri

2121.349 --> 2127.55
bear building that but the whole point

2123.089 --> 2127.5499999999997
is they can't because it doesn't work

2129.589 --> 2134.099
otherwise it would be out there there

2132.15 --> 2136.23
would be the program that that you

2134.099 --> 2138.78
really interface with yourself and just

2136.23 --> 2140.94
think around it and then show how the

2138.78 --> 2147.48
physics work on the ball earth it

2140.94 --> 2151.4700000000003
doesn't exist yet not anything that's

2147.48 --> 2153.42
really worthwhile beyond just basic

2151.47 --> 2154.4399999999996
pictures and maybe one slide or

2153.42 --> 2159.619
something you can do

2154.44 --> 2159.619
that's it doesn't prove anything

2172.85 --> 2179.02
are you talking about a man like me what

2179.24 --> 2187.97
despite new see'em okay it's like a

2183.78 --> 2187.9700000000003
theme park museum or something weird

2188.48 --> 2195.7400000000002
called Star Trek v are all right what's

2193.62 --> 2195.74
that

2199.43 --> 2202.089
well

2205.839 --> 2211.799
okay that does actually look pretty

2209.589 --> 2211.799
decent

2214.769 --> 2220.66
a bit too many colors I think though ah

2218.68 --> 2223.1189999999997
just looking at it I'm already getting

2220.66 --> 2228.45
sick imagining like moving my head in

2223.119 --> 2231.4500000000003
this with all that color and stuff but

2228.45 --> 2231.45
anyway

2256.63 --> 2260.28
hey welcome back Amanda young

2272.82 --> 2280.88
is contain too many rocks oh sure like

2276.75 --> 2280.88
you mean the piece of wet petrified wood

2285.81 --> 2294.2599999999998
[Music]

2300.39 --> 2308.1299999999997
ha cool Missouri bear that is cute yeah

2307.14 --> 2310.71
over here

2308.13 --> 2312.36
no there's these Magpies going around

2310.71 --> 2315.89
you may hear them sometimes in the

2312.36 --> 2319.44
background because they get really loud

2315.89 --> 2321.8399999999997
and they constantly followed the parents

2319.44 --> 2323.85
around there's like two of them and you

2321.84 --> 2325.3500000000004
can literally see the parent just trying

2323.85 --> 2327.36
to get away from them just to get a

2325.35 --> 2330.0
moment of quiet and they constantly

2327.36 --> 2334.65
follow him around and start blaring blue

2330.0 --> 2337.56
blurting right next to his head it's

2334.65 --> 2341.31
kinda sad to see that but I've seen him

2337.56 --> 2344.87
I think it's a him seen him hunting for

2341.31 --> 2344.87
worms to it and one point

2349.23 --> 2356.93
but yeah Magpies are not as eloquent as

2353.93 --> 2356.93
Robins

2387.49 --> 2390.54
[Music]

2411.369 --> 2420.509
I really backed up by scientific

2415.15 --> 2420.509
evidence you say Missouri Bear mm-hmm

2425.79 --> 2432.77
I'm sure you're right though but it's

2429.6 --> 2432.77
yeah you gotta be careful

2433.41 --> 2436.46
[Music]

2454.07 --> 2459.56
the world turning into bizarre a theme

2456.59 --> 2462.56
park well yeah that that's odd that you

2459.56 --> 2469.58
say that because I had the similar

2462.56 --> 2472.52
feeling it's like the luxuries are in a

2469.58 --> 2474.74
way peaking because of the newly and

2472.52 --> 2478.1
like the phone's just the phones alone

2474.74 --> 2481.1
you know there's so much extra time and

2478.1 --> 2483.86
money on people's hands on average

2481.1 --> 2487.58
because of all that that yeah there's

2483.86 --> 2489.86
gonna be more boredom and like hanging

2487.58 --> 2492.3199999999997
around in social media all day is gonna

2489.86 --> 2497.15
drive people nuts they want to get out -

2492.32 --> 2499.9100000000003
and a theme park yeah it's very very

2497.15 --> 2501.77
basically appealing it's very easy you

2499.91 --> 2505.2799999999997
just gets it through the ride it's kind

2501.77 --> 2508.67
of like a movie and yeah people want to

2505.28 --> 2511.3700000000003
get away from screens so physical rights

2508.67 --> 2514.4900000000002
might be very appealing to them at some

2511.37 --> 2519.37
point so yeah it is kind of likely that

2514.49 --> 2519.37
there will be more theme park stuff

2520.15 --> 2529.37
because of the yeah because of things

2525.28 --> 2531.71
luxuries increasing although yeah with

2529.37 --> 2535.2799999999997
the lockdown whatever yeah that

2531.71 --> 2537.41
situation doesn't exactly help but on

2535.28 --> 2541.1800000000003
the long run it's likely that they're

2537.41 --> 2541.18
just going to be more theme park things

2564.02 --> 2570.23
do you think you can balance a bowling

2566.93 --> 2577.3399999999997
ball on the edge for a very hard and

2570.23 --> 2580.82
sharp tabletop sure if the bowling ball

2577.34 --> 2582.8900000000003
is not gonna effectively Bend anything

2580.82 --> 2587.36
about that table if it is absolutely

2582.89 --> 2591.0499999999997
adamantly rigid and inflexible then sure

2587.36 --> 2594.4100000000003
it could balance on the tippy top corner

2591.05 --> 2598.67
of it even but if it is even is

2594.41 --> 2600.6499999999996
impressed by it slightly then yeah I

2598.67 --> 2607.04
will become an even and probably drop

2600.65 --> 2609.37
off oh hey don't ever run don't worry

2607.04 --> 2609.37
about it

2610.09 --> 2613.579
[Music]

2621.96 --> 2629.61
what speed what Flat Earth speed what

2630.15 --> 2637.83
what are you talking about what

2634.3 --> 2637.8300000000004
unbalance density

2644.51 --> 2650.9900000000002
no I did not John John Mack the camera

2648.8 --> 2655.1800000000003
may just be angled slightly different as

2650.99 --> 2655.18
normal something like that

2671.28 --> 2675.5600000000004
hmm okay you have a good to know

2679.36 --> 2686.29
speed it would be if it's turning

2683.68 --> 2687.6699999999996
spinning yeah but this Flat Earth model

2686.29 --> 2690.34
you're talking about

2687.67 --> 2694.4500000000003
there is no Flat Earth model conception

2690.34 --> 2698.2000000000003
that is spinning or moving okay except

2694.45 --> 2701.4399999999996
well no there isn't it's just that the

2698.2 --> 2704.08
Flat Earth Society supposes that it is

2701.44 --> 2709.42
physically literal accelerating upwards

2704.08 --> 2712.36
in space but there are nobody from 2050

2709.42 --> 2720.91
and F er yeah as a flat earther would

2712.36 --> 2722.65
uphold that argument at this point yeah

2720.91 --> 2725.5299999999997
that's very nice that you want to make a

2722.65 --> 2727.9300000000003
flat earth micro model in a theme park

2725.53 --> 2732.5800000000004
and then make it spinning that's very

2727.93 --> 2734.3199999999997
nice abomination you wanna yeah mix in

2732.58 --> 2737.98
these things that are obviously not real

2734.32 --> 2742.1800000000003
well I don't I don't really care for a

2737.98 --> 2748.51
flat earth ride that's spinning thank

2742.18 --> 2750.7
you very much maybe a Sun and the moon

2748.51 --> 2754.8900000000003
ride on the flatter of Plateau or

2750.7 --> 2754.89
something you know that's that's fine

2755.31 --> 2764.59
but hey if the Flat Earth is stationary

2759.58 --> 2766.66
and yeah and not spinning so if you can

2764.59 --> 2770.17
hold yourself to that then it'll be all

2766.66 --> 2771.94
fine I thank you good servant for the

2770.17 --> 2775.23
dollar and five cents super chat

2771.94 --> 2775.23
donation much appreciated

2781.68 --> 2788.77
no Missouri bear that's incorrect

2785.369 --> 2792.599
physicists are not retards for the most

2788.77 --> 2795.97
part and they do know a lot they just

2792.599 --> 2797.5
might have not figured out certain

2795.97 --> 2800.89
things in between what they were

2797.5 --> 2803.02
learning that is the worst that couldn't

2800.89 --> 2805.92
happen but yeah you can't be a physicist

2803.02 --> 2810.25
and not know nothing that doesn't work

2805.92 --> 2812.98
this is not like some yeah your dad

2810.25 --> 2814.69
handing you a job type of situation no

2812.98 --> 2817.539
even if you're going to be a physicist

2814.69 --> 2819.2200000000003
then you have to be a physicist you got

2817.539 --> 2826.23
to learn all that [ __ ] so they

2819.22 --> 2828.0989999999997
definitely do know that that's yeah

2826.23 --> 2829.69
doesn't mean that they're going to be

2828.099 --> 2832.75
right about whatever they're gonna argue

2829.69 --> 2836.43
though they definitely do know stuff or

2832.75 --> 2836.43
you can't become a physicist

2869.95 --> 2872.49
yeah

2886.339 --> 2896.589
now Missouri bear it's not nonsense look

2893.269 --> 2900.3489999999997
or unless you actually meant

2896.589 --> 2902.709
astrophysicists a physicist is not

2900.349 --> 2902.7090000000003
nonsense

2902.949 --> 2911.289
okay Missouri they're astrophysicists

2907.279 --> 2916.339
however they are like theoretical

2911.289 --> 2919.4300000000003
physicists it is very specific they

2916.339 --> 2923.39
dabble into conceptual things that are

2919.43 --> 2925.5789999999997
outside of physical reality now yeah if

2923.39 --> 2930.2889999999998
you say that they learn nonsense I

2925.579 --> 2934.309
totally agree but physicists do not they

2930.289 --> 2943.3900000000003
definitely learn legitimate knowledge so

2934.309 --> 2946.9
please don't do that for your own good

2943.39 --> 2946.9
stop doing that

2951.16 --> 2954.35
[Music]

2995.59 --> 3004.6600000000003
well Missouri bear look educated people

3001.39 --> 3007.27
are not exempt from making really stupid

3004.66 --> 3009.94
mistakes and not properly figuring out

3007.27 --> 3013.3
what they're learning that doesn't mean

3009.94 --> 3015.01
they don't know anything just they don't

3013.3 --> 3018.28
know how to deal with their knowledge

3015.01 --> 3021.88
you know I said it many times before if

3018.28 --> 3024.73
you're very intelligent that means

3021.88 --> 3026.92
you're probably going to be incredibly

3024.73 --> 3031.2400000000002
stupid at certain points in your life

3026.92 --> 3037.7200000000003
it's almost inevitable because that just

3031.24 --> 3042.8799999999997
happens you know most people can't

3037.72 --> 3043.75
handle their own intelligence it's as

3042.88 --> 3045.61
simple as that

3043.75 --> 3048.57
so yeah a lot of educated people are

3045.61 --> 3051.52
probably going to have some issues

3048.57 --> 3055.1200000000003
especially when you poke in irregular

3051.52 --> 3058.32
places actually test the foundations of

3055.12 --> 3058.3199999999997
their knowledge you know that

3075.119 --> 3083.44
astrophysicist a lot of high thinking

3077.41 --> 3085.7799999999997
yeah high on a dream that's no they're

3083.44 --> 3089.099
completely wasting their own time and

3085.78 --> 3095.349
everyone's because it's the all [ __ ]

3089.099 --> 3098.799
nothing is ever gonna be proven I have

3095.349 --> 3101.4700000000003
high level thinking you know I could do

3098.799 --> 3103.63
that but yeah I don't want to waste my

3101.47 --> 3106.089
time making up all kinds of [ __ ] and

3103.63 --> 3108.069
then pretending it's real and then a

3106.089 --> 3111.13
system working along hand-in-hand with

3108.069 --> 3116.95
that saying yeah yeah it's real keep on

3111.13 --> 3119.94
going making that good good yeah now

3116.95 --> 3123.3999999999996
that's not something I was gonna do

3119.94 --> 3126.849
because I want to get real I want to

3123.4 --> 3131.67
figure out the real things don't want

3126.849 --> 3135.089
this occupation yeah occupational

3131.67 --> 3139.329
therapist I don't want to occupational

3135.089 --> 3141.7599999999998
therapy punic type of science job where

3139.329 --> 3147.099
I'm literally wasting all my time and

3141.76 --> 3151.4500000000003
everyone's it's a terrible terrible

3147.099 --> 3153.28
realization to live like that ya know

3151.45 --> 3156.9399999999996
I'd rather be stuck here in the trenches

3153.28 --> 3158.92
over at the Flat Earth debate and go

3156.94 --> 3161.9500000000003
head-to-head with people that I've

3158.92 --> 3164.4700000000003
studied and then figuring out the little

3161.95 --> 3165.5789999999997
Cornish word they didn't look that's

3164.47 --> 3170.0099999999998
what I do

3165.579 --> 3170.01
and I can do it much better over here I

3171.27 --> 3177.299
learned so much more not studying not

3175.27 --> 3180.339
actually going that standard route

3177.299 --> 3184.2
although I did yeah it read through it

3180.339 --> 3184.2
but it never really went for it I

3184.319 --> 3191.069
learned so much more I think just not

3188.349 --> 3191.069
doing all that

3202.24 --> 3209.7099999999996
when you talk about spiritual stuff then

3204.64 --> 3213.7
it is out of my imagining you mean you

3209.71 --> 3217.33
can't keep track of that you can feel

3213.7 --> 3228.1499999999996
outside of the regular physical world

3217.33 --> 3228.15
can you you can't alright

3233.03 --> 3237.8190000000004
must be very silent placed and for you

3235.9 --> 3242.349
inside of your mind

3237.819 --> 3242.349
with me it's constantly just

3247.559 --> 3253.799
you can't keep track of it I don't know

3250.259 --> 3255.599
who can keep track of it I can keep

3253.799 --> 3256.529
track of it I understand what I'm

3255.599 --> 3261.119
talking about

3256.529 --> 3263.519
it's just that yeah it's very unusual it

3261.119 --> 3265.9100000000003
is I'm really trying to mechanically

3263.519 --> 3270.569
deal with something that is yeah

3265.91 --> 3272.939
intangible in many ways that I've been

3270.569 --> 3275.609
trying that since I was 15 when I first

3272.939 --> 3278.009
figured it out that like there's

3275.609 --> 3280.64
something wrong there's like there is

3278.009 --> 3284.069
real like energies things and

3280.64 --> 3287.0389999999998
consciousness things mysteries and magic

3284.069 --> 3290.699
like magical 'no stand for in line with

3287.039 --> 3293.789
the standard science but it is there so

3290.699 --> 3296.64
why isn't it given a proper place in

3293.789 --> 3299.6400000000003
discovery and that was kind of my

3296.64 --> 3302.209
mission or early on the bridge that gap

3299.64 --> 3306.449
between magic and sciences was now

3302.209 --> 3308.1299999999997
thinking about it it's like oh [ __ ] in a

3306.449 --> 3312.199
way i really tried to play and

3308.13 --> 3316.109
accidentally into the whole system i

3312.199 --> 3319.469
realized that now but i still think it's

3316.109 --> 3322.41
just worth mechanically trying to

3319.469 --> 3324.869
understand and explore and deal with the

3322.41 --> 3328.439
ethereal and the spirit and the metaphor

3324.869 --> 3330.6600000000003
the metaphor the power of metaphors and

3328.439 --> 3334.16
how easy it can be to make people

3330.66 --> 3338.8089999999997
understand things through them and just

3334.16 --> 3341.5389999999998
the whole virtual mind and how it works

3338.809 --> 3345.63
how you remember things how you see them

3341.539 --> 3347.7290000000003
just get it all charted better to me so

3345.63 --> 3350.1890000000003
not following some standard book of

3347.729 --> 3354.3489999999997
psychology or something no and literally

3350.189 --> 3358.319
building it all virtually for myself

3354.349 --> 3360.7090000000003
every moment of the day it's just part

3358.319 --> 3360.709
of what I do

3363.12 --> 3367.93
and I'm not the only one there's other

3366.13 --> 3372.33
people doing it too and some of them are

3367.93 --> 3375.22
trying to like weave in mystery you know

3372.33 --> 3378.43
turn it more into a storytelling type of

3375.22 --> 3381.1899999999996
system I don't tend to really do that I

3378.43 --> 3383.3199999999997
don't like to play with that because I

3381.19 --> 3386.32
see it all it's like sacred information

3383.32 --> 3389.9500000000003
that I'm just that I get access to and

3386.32 --> 3391.7200000000003
feel very lucky sometimes that I could

3389.95 --> 3398.0499999999997
just touch upon these things you can see

3391.72 --> 3399.3999999999996
it thank God every day for that on the

3398.05 --> 3400.9300000000003
other hand yeah I get to see things that

3399.4 --> 3402.64
I don't really want to see not so

3400.93 --> 3403.4199999999996
thankful to God for that but yeah that's

3402.64 --> 3409.44
how it works

3403.42 --> 3409.44
this can't have one without the other

3414.45 --> 3425.73
anyway I'm gonna round out the show guys

3416.68 --> 3428.94
it was good it's still very warm here

3425.73 --> 3428.94
hold on

3434.76 --> 3442.9500000000003
yeah yeah that's called synchronicity

3438.33 --> 3446.0099999999998
Guns of Navarone look thinking patterns

3442.95 --> 3448.5299999999997
and trains of thought they're not really

3446.01 --> 3452.5200000000004
as unique as you might imagine them to

3448.53 --> 3455.2200000000003
be there's just a natural progression of

3452.52 --> 3456.63
logical thought or the systematic

3455.22 --> 3461.0699999999997
evasion they're off

3456.63 --> 3464.94
it is also systematic see it's all

3461.07 --> 3467.82
systematic every thinking pattern is

3464.94 --> 3470.46
systematic in a way so yeah the more you

3467.82 --> 3471.9300000000003
go in tune with the situation you're

3470.46 --> 3474.06
looking at and you're feeling like yeah

3471.93 --> 3476.0099999999998
this is this is something that's got to

3474.06 --> 3477.869
be said it's very likely there's gonna

3476.01 --> 3482.4
be more people that exactly the same

3477.869 --> 3482.73
time are gonna say that happens all the

3482.4 --> 3484.92
time

3482.73 --> 3488.119
especially when you're over at the old

3484.92 --> 3490.94
Benjamin's seriously just the the

3488.119 --> 3493.71
synchronicities are off the charts but

3490.94 --> 3495.63
you got to be there to realize it that

3493.71 --> 3496.89
that's real that's really happening it's

3495.63 --> 3500.369
crazy other words

3496.89 --> 3503.4
yeah the stronger the tighter the

3500.369 --> 3506.04
frequency the more this happens the more

3503.4 --> 3508.32
strength you pour into doing that more

3506.04 --> 3509.66
synchronicity start to happen it just

3508.32 --> 3512.4900000000002
happens

3509.66 --> 3514.56
right so anyway I am gonna round out the
