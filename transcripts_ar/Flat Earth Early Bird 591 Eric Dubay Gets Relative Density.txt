119.59 --> 127.83
yeah the weather today is weird yeah

123.069 --> 130.66
there was actually a huge amount of rain

127.83 --> 135.069
being splashed all over us not even two

130.66 --> 137.04999999999998
hours ago like really big you couldn't

135.069 --> 140.5
even see further than three meters in

137.05 --> 144.16000000000003
the air so much rain but now just it's

140.5 --> 147.88
that huge black wasn't even grey was

144.16 --> 149.04999999999998
just black cloud bank has moved way to

147.88 --> 152.28

isn't that just an amazing sight guys

188.4 --> 195.73000000000002
and that's just a webcam with my eyes I

192.94 --> 200.34
can actually see 3d and all that and

195.73 --> 203.04999999999998
it's just astounding what I'm seeing

200.34 --> 206.29
it's like all these different layers of

203.05 --> 209.08
clouds in it I can even see perspective

206.29 --> 212.98
basically because they're pretty far

209.08 --> 219.19
apart and it's amazing what it looks

212.98 --> 222.37
like yeah very picturesque cloud

219.19 --> 231.85

264.91 --> 268.66
was like okay I'm gonna get like

267.1 --> 277.06

right so it was flutters debate

362.569 --> 371.47900000000004

371.479 --> 377.75
think I'm sleeping warrior was in there

373.129 --> 381.68

435.319 --> 440.87
kind of fizzy don't feel too much like

437.9 --> 442.669
that right now but I might who knows

440.87 --> 446.33
otherwise I'll just save it up for next

442.669 --> 449.71
day there's no exploration data on these

446.33 --> 454.43
things as long as you don't open them

449.71 --> 458.69
yeah more left to fill right I also saw

454.43 --> 462.169
a response video from left Vale or well

458.69 --> 466.479
I saw it passing by in his reruns on the

462.169 --> 466.479
life Annie was being

467.77 --> 474.46
while he was basically being exactly

470.919 --> 478.21
like he was in that email so this I

474.46 --> 480.27
don't know not a beef starting up I

478.21 --> 480.27
think

486.99 --> 494.22
Pope gone Queen gone fed res gone what

491.01 --> 499.44
what are you talking about the English

494.22 --> 505.74
be mas compliance right yeah yeah a lot

499.44 --> 508.26
about the mask again and the open my own

505.74 --> 513.66
late stream okay I didn't see the late

508.26 --> 515.46
stream but he was also opening up some

513.66 --> 517.7099999999999
mail during the first stream I think

515.46 --> 520.3100000000001
anyway thanks for updating me about that

517.71 --> 520.3100000000001
Missouri bear

525.68 --> 533.1189999999999
oh yeah yeah that's right I was watching

529.459 --> 535.79
a Roderigo Ferrari Nunez I don't know if

533.119 --> 540.019
he thinks that's like racist if I say it

535.79 --> 543.5889999999999
like that it's just this aim is so that

540.019 --> 546.559
language I have to say it like that just

543.589 --> 550.1600000000001
like I have to say Einstein because it's

546.559 --> 552.709
German anyway I really appreciate the

550.16 --> 555.8
guy and his work and it's very

552.709 --> 560.3889999999999
persistent and he was doing a stream

555.8 --> 562.3689999999999
again but yeah I was watching that

560.389 --> 570.139
commenting a lot and he was constantly

562.369 --> 573.2900000000001
getting well like taken down for policy

570.139 --> 575.98
violation but then continued like

573.29 --> 578.509
nothing had happened so they were like

575.98 --> 582.379
copyright straight like literally like

578.509 --> 585.0790000000001
geek black screen like infringement of

582.379 --> 586.8190000000001
[ __ ] and then after two minutes or

585.079 --> 588.8889999999999
something it would start up again and

586.819 --> 593.329
that happened like three or four times

588.889 --> 596.2090000000001
it was crazy I've never seen that makes

593.329 --> 598.6099999999999
no sense because that screen only pops

596.209 --> 600.8599999999999
up like usually when you get a strike

598.61 --> 605.389
and then your channels just blocked it

600.86 --> 607.249
was so weird and did you know that no

605.389 --> 611.3290000000001
digas is living in the net what

607.249 --> 613.429
no he isn't no I asked him specifically

611.329 --> 614.959
because I thought and this is my mistake

613.429 --> 617.72
I thought that he was living in South

614.959 --> 621.8
America just like the other guy who's on

617.72 --> 623.3000000000001
globe Buster's regularly he is not I mix

621.8 --> 625.91
it up it's stupid

623.3 --> 628.99
but yeah me and all my networking skills

625.91 --> 631.85
yeah I'm so great I mix up two people

628.99 --> 635.17
after this long time I'm just stupid

631.85 --> 635.1700000000001
sorry we Rodriguez

638.72 --> 646.38
but he is living in a town in America by

643.32 --> 648.9300000000001
his own saying yeah

646.38 --> 651.45
I was mixing up with yo I think or

648.93 --> 654.27
thought that he was like also in South

651.45 --> 661.95
America or something I don't know I just

654.27 --> 663.81
mix it up stupid so I thought he did

661.95 --> 665.9100000000001
live the internet well maybe he has

663.81 --> 668.9699999999999
lived in the Netherlands for some time I

665.91 --> 672.03
don't know I haven't followed him that

668.97 --> 676.9100000000001
persistently it's only recently that I'm

672.03 --> 676.91
just starting to tap into its dreams

677.18 --> 682.9799999999999
[Music]

679.88 --> 686.55
right right Roberto yeah yeah after that

682.98 --> 688.59
also been watching the card again pretty

686.55 --> 698.3299999999999
much watched in the episode or two half

688.59 --> 700.89
episode stopped being so freaking loud I

698.33 --> 704.07
don't know if you can yeah you you are

700.89 --> 706.23
gonna hear that there's so it's like the

704.07 --> 707.7600000000001
youngsters are constantly whining to

706.23 --> 711.78
their parents that constantly it's

707.76 --> 714.48
everywhere by the way ever I go out my

711.78 --> 716.37
bike I see other Magpies doing the same

714.48 --> 723.87
thing having young son constantly

716.37 --> 725.61
whining really loud and they're doing it

723.87 --> 731.94
like right next to the head of their

725.61 --> 735.36
parents they're so annoying anyway yeah

731.94 --> 740.75
watch more Picard and a distinct

735.36 --> 746.58
patterns start to emerge in my analysis

740.75 --> 752.94
that is there's something wrong with

746.58 --> 755.4000000000001
this series like deeply it's kind of the

752.94 --> 758.58
same pattern as what happened with

755.4 --> 761.22
discovery I already said back then he

758.58 --> 764.85
had reminded me of it it's like it's

761.22 --> 769.33
made the same team it's

764.85 --> 771.73
it's slightly too manipulative it's

769.33 --> 774.12
almost like it's meant for people that

771.73 --> 779.23
are just numb down in their social

774.12 --> 783.25
interactions really cuz things were just

779.23 --> 786.1
offered traumatized it wasn't natural

783.25 --> 789.49
and the music put too much on it to like

786.1 --> 793.2090000000001
I like the music it's classical but it's

789.49 --> 795.25
it it just wasn't right there's

793.209 --> 798.9699999999999
something wrong about it it's really

795.25 --> 801.399
weird and and another thing I got a

798.97 --> 805.029
couple of really odd scenes in there

801.399 --> 807.67
like really weird like Picard went up to

805.029 --> 810.45
kid and then the kid was like yeah I

807.67 --> 815.5889999999999
heard you don't like kids too much and

810.45 --> 818.649
Picard is like well I like you so yeah

815.589 --> 822.5500000000001
apparently his character has though

818.649 --> 825.22
doesn't like kids now that didn't used

822.55 --> 830.4699999999999
to be that way because Picard in the

825.22 --> 833.649
series like didn't like didn't have any

830.47 --> 836.76
fatherly skills he said he would always

833.649 --> 839.5
approach kids on the same level right

836.76 --> 843.399
mmm whatever year you're gonna associate

839.5 --> 848.22
that with but he he but he never hated

843.399 --> 850.72
kids and he was always good to kids and

848.22 --> 852.61
then now he's not like being nasty to

850.72 --> 857.02
kids here but like that was just so

852.61 --> 860.399
weird it's almost like Picard or the

857.02 --> 860.399
actor himself

862.07 --> 869.509
there's just the atmosphere was wrong I

866.86 --> 871.79
yeah I don't know maybe you've picked up

869.509 --> 874.24
on it I mean for me it's like extra

871.79 --> 878.54
tough because I'm a pretty big fan

874.24 --> 881.9300000000001
pretty much of the next generation I

878.54 --> 885.4699999999999
thought it was really it was good

881.93 --> 889.04
despite the eugenics influences and all

885.47 --> 892.009
that and I thought that Picard as a

889.04 --> 897.05
character was always like admirable at

892.009 --> 899.6
least even with his weird liberal

897.05 --> 903.2299999999999
tendencies and all that but here I don't

899.6 --> 905.75
know it's it's not like completely wrong

903.23 --> 908.5600000000001
no no he actually does kind of defend

905.75 --> 916.36
situations but it's almost like that

908.56 --> 920.2399999999999
it's almost almost like they've tried to

916.36 --> 923.54
copy-paste the atmosphere or steal it

920.24 --> 926.389
yeah yeah it's it felt to me so strong

923.54 --> 931.42
like this is almost like they're trying

926.389 --> 938.42
to merge with what the Firefly serie was

931.42 --> 940.37
but not exactly they wanted to change

938.42 --> 944.05
the style the angle more about diplomacy

940.37 --> 947.9590000000001
of course big background stuff the card

944.05 --> 952.91
but they the team they wanted to make it

947.959 --> 955.6389999999999
more personal and it's like okay yeah

952.91 --> 963.55
the characters maybe oh they'll grow on

955.639 --> 966.7090000000001
me but it's just not as real as fluid as

963.55 --> 969.319
it was a Firefly where the characters

966.709 --> 973.31
were just absolutely real they were

969.319 --> 976.189
absolutely real was so well done and the

973.31 --> 980.93
music was perfect in Firefly they've

976.189 --> 983.3
really really complimented the

980.93 --> 985.7589999999999
atmosphere and the tone and the feel of

983.3 --> 991.37
the characters and even the funny things

985.759 --> 995.29
and here it's like they wanted to have

991.37 --> 999.29
that but it just didn't work

995.29 --> 1000.8499999999999
maybe they I'm now being just yeah I

999.29 --> 1003.73
don't know may I feel like I'm being a

1000.85 --> 1006.4
movie critic here and yeah it's up for

1003.73 --> 1008.35
interpretation right but this is like

1006.4 --> 1011.02
the impression that I'm getting now and

1008.35 --> 1015.4300000000001
it's really getting stronger like wow

1011.02 --> 1020.35
this dude's wannabe Firefly and it's

1015.43 --> 1024.48
like the chemistry isn't complete it's

1020.35 --> 1024.48
not it's not working

1030.27 --> 1036.72
anybody else got that or did you all get

1033.36 --> 1039.6889999999999
stuck on other things with that series

1036.72 --> 1042.1200000000001
has anybody seen it no it's not a net

1039.689 --> 1044.309
Netflix series its Picard it's I don't

1042.12 --> 1051.78
know where it is I'm I'm illegally

1044.309 --> 1054.69
downloading it with VPN right but I am

1051.78 --> 1056.22
every series that I find it worth the

1054.69 --> 1059.52
download I'll give it an honest review

1056.22 --> 1068.28
and I'm I am I swear I'm not

1059.52 --> 1071.4
politicizing Amazon Prime okay

1068.28 --> 1071.3999999999999
[Music]

1080.41 --> 1089.8600000000001
right well Robin Stanley there is a lot

1084.16 --> 1094.0900000000001
of good work in it Oh Oh spoilers

1089.86 --> 1101.7099999999998
minor spoilers they have a samurai

1094.09 --> 1107.1899999999998
Legolas yep

1101.71 --> 1110.02
did they do it's exactly what it is and

1107.19 --> 1111.93
there is nobody in the world that can

1110.02 --> 1114.85
prove otherwise

1111.93 --> 1119.23
everybody knows what that is it's a

1114.85 --> 1123.1299999999999
samurai Legolas and he's pretty cool bit

1119.23 --> 1125.34
out of place though what we'll see where

1123.13 --> 1125.3400000000001
that goes

1126.03 --> 1137.26
but you know what I mean right come on

1130.86 --> 1140.4399999999998
he he is and he's got the the Romulan

1137.26 --> 1143.35
ears which are like Vulcan ears they're

1140.44 --> 1148.93
basically the brother race and he's a

1143.35 --> 1152.9499999999998
samurai and honorbound fighter warrior

1148.93 --> 1157.54
master with martial arts and swords he

1152.95 --> 1160.54
is somewhere I Legolas but I actually

1157.54 --> 1164.8899999999999
think it's kind of interesting it's it's

1160.54 --> 1166.6599999999999
a bit it's a bit D&D ish but I don't

1164.89 --> 1169.5400000000002
know well see what do you make of it I

1166.66 --> 1173.8300000000002
just got one episode with him now and he

1169.54 --> 1182.04
did pretty extreme [ __ ] in there I don't

1173.83 --> 1184.75
know man so yeah again did you see it

1182.04 --> 1187.1499999999999
from what I described it seems like

1184.75 --> 1189.67
there's just things off about it but

1187.15 --> 1190.39
it's still the interesting thing to

1189.67 --> 1193.8100000000002
behold

1190.39 --> 1196.66
so far it's just not something you will

1193.81 --> 1201.37
be like oh I got a freaking watch every

1196.66 --> 1204.3100000000002
episode in a sequence now with Firefly

1201.37 --> 1208.4499999999998
that's absolutely the case once you get

1204.31 --> 1210.37
past the first episode like when you've

1208.45 --> 1213.67
basically when you've watched the first

1210.37 --> 1214.4499999999998
and the second episode of Firefly you're

1213.67 --> 1217.1490000000001
going to be

1214.45 --> 1223.3890000000001
freakin hooked if you like sci-fi if you

1217.149 --> 1224.4599999999998
like Wild Wild West atmosphere but not

1223.389 --> 1228.039
cartoony

1224.46 --> 1233.739
like the style and the music style and

1228.039 --> 1237.549
sci-fi and a band of smugglers basically

1233.739 --> 1240.359
if that appeals to you you will see the

1237.549 --> 1243.989
entire series from beginning to end and

1240.359 --> 1246.6999999999998
then the movie you will because it is

1243.989 --> 1249.789
the best science fiction series I've

1246.7 --> 1256.029
ever seen pretty much just the whole

1249.789 --> 1257.889
works certain masterpiece anyway yeah

1256.029 --> 1261.509
but that's Firefly I haven't seen in a

1257.889 --> 1265.059
while showed the the I have the blu-ray

1261.509 --> 1267.279
right so that happened then I started

1265.059 --> 1270.129
yet not a lot of Flat Earth activity

1267.279 --> 1272.409
after this point although I did in this

1270.129 --> 1275.519
morning I'll get to that then I watched

1272.409 --> 1277.779
through Netflix an older movie that I

1275.519 --> 1279.879
can't remem I've actually watch I

1277.779 --> 1282.609
thought I mistaken dinner for another

1279.879 --> 1286.9889999999998
one but I watched drunken master and

1282.609 --> 1290.109
it's like a Chinese Hollywood hybrid I

1286.989 --> 1292.45
don't know Chinese weird it was really

1290.109 --> 1297.22
really weird Chinese style with

1292.45 --> 1299.0800000000002
basically pretty bad behavior by today's

1297.22 --> 1303.039
standards but that's like in the stuff

1299.08 --> 1304.96
that movies and all that but yeah I

1303.039 --> 1306.9089999999999
thought it was the legend of the drunken

1304.96 --> 1309.7
master which is the second movie which

1306.909 --> 1313.8400000000001
is like one of the my favorite martial

1309.7 --> 1318.269
arts movies and I basically even made a

1313.84 --> 1321.759
prestige class in D&D made after that or

1318.269 --> 1325.1490000000001
rather remade it I think no I'm pretty

1321.759 --> 1327.279
sure I made it from scratch or maybe it

1325.149 --> 1330.369
was there and I just improved upon it I

1327.279 --> 1334.72
don't remember but yeah the first one

1330.369 --> 1337.269
was it was like pretty cheap compared

1334.72 --> 1340.69
and like the second one was much more

1337.269 --> 1345.8990000000001
detailed and much later because this

1340.69 --> 1345.8990000000001
movie was made in is it

1351.12 --> 1359.29
1987 or something and the other one was

1354.82 --> 1359.8
in 97 so I don't know but he had Jackie

1359.29 --> 1361.78
Chan

1359.8 --> 1363.76
they're both Jackie Chan and in the

1361.78 --> 1366.73
first one Jack hands really young and

1363.76 --> 1369.43
he's like very muscular he's like bigger

1366.73 --> 1372.79
and it's funny because like in the

1369.43 --> 1374.8300000000002
second movie he's already smaller

1372.79 --> 1375.99
because in that first one he kind of

1374.83 --> 1380.47
looks like Bruce Lee

1375.99 --> 1384.34
he's like really ripped on the on the

1380.47 --> 1388.8
upper muscles and [ __ ] and the second

1384.34 --> 1394.4499999999998
one he's he's more slim ish already

1388.8 --> 1397.35
right anyway I watch that also I thought

1394.45 --> 1400.15
that the the teacher drunken master

1397.35 --> 1401.9199999999998
character in that first movie you and

1400.15 --> 1404.14
nothing like that appeared in the second

1401.92 --> 1406.0
one it's just this just Jackie Chan in

1404.14 --> 1409.75
the second one but I thought that the

1406.0 --> 1411.49
character as a design and just in the

1409.75 --> 1413.74
movie I thought the character of the

1411.49 --> 1416.77
drunken master the old man was really

1413.74 --> 1419.38
cool I thought he reminds me of tenth

1416.77 --> 1422.59
man but like Chinese version and a

1419.38 --> 1427.8090000000002
martial artist and a drunk so I guess I

1422.59 --> 1429.4289999999999
don't know maybe yeah I guess it doesn't

1427.809 --> 1433.1789999999999
remind me too much of that man I don't

1429.429 --> 1438.8500000000001
think that man is a drunk but it's just

1433.179 --> 1441.7900000000002
a yeah spirited old man that's a little

1438.85 --> 1446.86
nutty and I don't know I thought his

1441.79 --> 1450.1789999999999
character was kind of funny name old man

1446.86 --> 1450.1789999999999
Sam seen what

1454.73 --> 1461.239
was that the name of the of the old man

1458.48 --> 1465.08
in the drunken master movie could be I

1461.239 --> 1468.44
forgot it's the movie wasn't really that

1465.08 --> 1471.35
special it was kind of a stupid story

1468.44 --> 1473.5700000000002
really made very little it was like for

1471.35 --> 1477.019
children but then it's about freakin

1473.57 --> 1481.9399999999998
drunken kung fu it makes wood the worst

1477.019 --> 1484.369
this is that's what it was like it was

1481.94 --> 1487.5800000000002
like a children's movie in like pretty

1484.369 --> 1490.249
stupid but yeah about drunken kung foo

1487.58 --> 1494.379
makes it's like the worst it's not

1490.249 --> 1494.3790000000001
something you wanted to show children

1496.239 --> 1503.859
the second one wasn't like that second

1501.2 --> 1509.749
one was just much more serious and

1503.859 --> 1513.519
comedic and I thought it was better the

1509.749 --> 1513.519
second one a lot better anyway

1513.94 --> 1521.739
Yeah right this morning Tony

1519.489 --> 1526.309
enthusiastically Skyped me about

1521.739 --> 1529.1000000000001
apparently how Eric Dubay his latest

1526.309 --> 1533.389
video had a complete description works

1529.1 --> 1535.549
of the relative density situation rent a

1533.389 --> 1538.2199999999998
relative density disequilibrium and how

1535.549 --> 1540.95
it is actual and scientifically proven

1538.22 --> 1541.429
and gravity isn't and yeah that was

1540.95 --> 1547.909
pretty cool

1541.429 --> 1549.8890000000001
oh I thought I might have gotten Tony on

1547.909 --> 1552.259
the on the show but it's kind of too

1549.889 --> 1553.6999999999998
late I think I know he'll probably talk

1552.259 --> 1557.289
about it on the flat earth debates and

1553.7 --> 1561.82
so will i but yeah that was pretty cool

1557.289 --> 1564.739
that Eric debate probably has really

1561.82 --> 1567.6689999999999
yeah has really absorbed the whole

1564.739 --> 1571.299
relative density disequilibrium system

1567.669 --> 1578.0590000000002
there's a good argument against gravity

1571.299 --> 1579.8899999999999
so that was pretty good to see oh wait

1578.059 --> 1584.87
see back

1579.89 --> 1587.95
I know if he pops up in chat uh I might

1584.87 --> 1587.9499999999998
call him up on the sky

1599.8 --> 1605.77
oh yeah yeah he was a professor Dave

1602.56 --> 1610.62
that was the target in that video that's

1605.77 --> 1614.53
right Eric Dubay every Dubey you know

1610.62 --> 1616.9199999999998
it's pretty okay Eric Dubay is pretty

1614.53 --> 1616.92
okay

1628.029 --> 1637.809
you see my colorful sweetheart what nice

1631.419 --> 1640.749
for heaven anyway oh yeah Iren works

1637.809 --> 1643.21
this morning was life I didn't know that

1640.749 --> 1645.519
but I was there in the chat and Mark

1643.21 --> 1648.219
Sargent was on life so it's interesting

1645.519 --> 1649.109
to hear from him like literally live in

1648.219 --> 1653.46
the moment

1649.109 --> 1657.519
even for him in a while it's always busy

1653.46 --> 1660.789
and he was basically trying to make a

1657.519 --> 1663.309
prediction about the covert situation

1660.789 --> 1665.2
and the government response and I

1663.309 --> 1670.299
thought I was pretty insightful what he

1665.2 --> 1672.339
had to say about it he's always like

1670.299 --> 1677.08
feeling the waters like that and he's

1672.339 --> 1680.859
pretty good at it well he what yeah the

1677.08 --> 1685.869
way he does it the how he does it what

1680.859 --> 1687.999
he talks about like in a way I do the

1685.869 --> 1695.259
same thing but I'm more I do it in a

1687.999 --> 1700.739
different way yeah okay now everybody's

1695.259 --> 1700.739
talking about martial arts movies I see

1711.75 --> 1719.57
all right so yeah that was it all right

1716.31 --> 1719.57
only took me half an hour

1745.96 --> 1754.179
and then

1748.429 --> 1754.179
Jackie Chan fighting Jet Li could be I

1754.389 --> 1759.649
haven't seen it in a while but that

1756.47 --> 1762.22
could be Guns of Navarone RFP like the

1759.649 --> 1764.6899999999998
new one is really a good movie I think

1762.22 --> 1765.559
like everything that was kind of wrong

1764.69 --> 1768.1390000000001
with the old one

1765.559 --> 1772.309
they absolutely improved upon it it made

1768.139 --> 1776.529
they made it more real the less of a

1772.309 --> 1776.529
stupid story that makes no sense

1791.93 --> 1795.019
[Music]

1811.6 --> 1816.57
music and drunken man which one the

1813.94 --> 1819.809
first one or the second one

1816.57 --> 1819.809
Gideon's sick

1826.65 --> 1833.47
right yeah and the sound effects man

1830.71 --> 1836.38
like they have like somebody basically

1833.47 --> 1838.54
banging different types of drums or

1836.38 --> 1841.47
whatever whenever they hit somebody to

1838.54 --> 1844.69
emphasize like oh how hard the hit is

1841.47 --> 1847.8700000000001
it's but you can really hear it it's

1844.69 --> 1849.64
it's like a theater play that is sort of

1847.87 --> 1853.09
turned into movie it well that's really

1849.64 --> 1859.96
the yeah that style but it is kinda

1853.09 --> 1862.32
silly like it doesn't you really have to

1859.96 --> 1865.0
have a powerful suspense of disbelief

1862.32 --> 1875.35
ability to to really take that seriously

1865.0 --> 1877.87
oh yeah also I noticed something weird

1875.35 --> 1879.76
that appear I don't know what it is but

1877.87 --> 1881.86
maybe some of like the original

1879.76 --> 1884.71
recordings were lost or something

1881.86 --> 1886.3
because I was watching the Chinese

1884.71 --> 1890.02
version and with English subtitles

1886.3 --> 1893.3799999999999
because it just wanted yeah just just do

1890.02 --> 1895.69
it in the in the Chinese language but

1893.38 --> 1900.19
there were parts when suddenly they

1895.69 --> 1902.26
started to talk English almost like yeah

1900.19 --> 1906.51
the Chinese recordings were I did not

1902.26 --> 1910.0
made or lost that was really weird

1906.51 --> 1914.32
also because they dubbed it pretty bad

1910.0 --> 1916.39
like they were be like it was blatantly

1914.32 --> 1919.4199999999998
obvious that must be people that were in

1916.39 --> 1921.16
these parts talking English literally

1919.42 --> 1925.0800000000002
didn't know how to talk English and they

1921.16 --> 1925.0800000000002
were just trying to mimic it sort of

1938.68 --> 1942.69
but how god shouting sorry

1960.93 --> 1967.3790000000001
hmm

1963.429 --> 1971.46
yeah there's a lot of those you know

1967.379 --> 1976.019
like Chinese ghost stories all those and

1971.46 --> 1980.019
yeah that I like those types of super

1976.019 --> 1982.69
supernatural crazy symbol magic [ __ ]

1980.019 --> 1983.519
that's like D&D stuff I really like

1982.69 --> 1987.8200000000002
those

1983.519 --> 1990.419
but yeah it's like a crazy fantasy thing

1987.82 --> 1994.559
but it I love - I love how that works I

1990.419 --> 1994.5590000000002
like them I appreciate them

2003.74 --> 2007.15
like the old ones

2010.929 --> 2024.0990000000002
I don't know who Trey Smith is Tom

2016.69 --> 2027.419
Parker oh holy [ __ ]

2024.099 --> 2027.4189999999999
Gideon's sick I didn't even know that

2028.409 --> 2032.9
yeah

2029.739 --> 2035.989
enter the dragon what a movie

2032.9 --> 2035.989
[Music]

2060.55 --> 2070.61
right right I think that makes sense

2066.07 --> 2072.59
because the way Jackie Chan looked in in

2070.61 --> 2076.13
the drunken master in the first one

2072.59 --> 2078.05
right that would fit in perfect I

2076.13 --> 2079.67
already said like hey he kind of looks

2078.05 --> 2082.8500000000004
like the Bruce Lee

2079.67 --> 2085.67
style so yeah he could have absolutely

2082.85 --> 2086.63
been exactly like that in anted a dragon

2085.67 --> 2089.3
that would make sense

2086.63 --> 2094.33
I might even recognize him if I'd saw it

2089.3 --> 2094.3300000000004
back huh it's funny

2364.27 --> 2368.46
a person Tom Parker I'll figure it out

2378.24 --> 2384.8399999999997
at least yeah he has a face that at

2381.94 --> 2388.69
least he's not gonna be a complete idiot

2384.84 --> 2396.1000000000004
you can't have a face like that if

2388.69 --> 2398.62
you're really freaking them so yeah

2396.1 --> 2401.5499999999997

appreciate his style and his insights

2401.55 --> 2405.15
thank you for the tip

2418.48 --> 2428.89
so also he's wearing a small hat in this

2421.63 --> 2431.32
video here like on his homepage half way

2428.89 --> 2433.33
after five and a half minutes

2431.32 --> 2436.9300000000003
yeah he's wearing a small hat during

2433.33 --> 2439.83
that whole piece I take it he's like in

2436.93 --> 2439.83
Israel there

2452.12 --> 2458.15
yeah not that I have anything against

2455.36 --> 2461.56
people that do that you know it's all

2458.15 --> 2461.56
about your actions

2463.13 --> 2466.179
[Music]

2471.46 --> 2474.969
[Music]

2487.02 --> 2490.94
are you talking about Steve

2512.39 --> 2517.43
good surfer I don't know it doesn't say

2518.99 --> 2528.54
but who knows maybe he's like Rob's key

2523.26 --> 2533.5800000000004
bow or like one of those those what

2528.54 --> 2536.1
those know it you go there a tauren

2533.58 --> 2539.5499999999997
maybe it's like that they wear small

2536.1 --> 2541.91
hats too so yeah

2539.55 --> 2541.9100000000003
nose

2547.71 --> 2553.8
he's not Rob's key he's not into

2549.6 --> 2556.3199999999997
religion a lot I don't know do life III

2553.8 --> 2560.82
have yet to watch any of his video so

2556.32 --> 2562.02
I'm just guessing here just going by

2560.82 --> 2573.3300000000004
what you're saying

2562.02 --> 2581.67
oh you're late again Amanda young well I

2573.33 --> 2583.95
was a little bit late today too so all

2581.67 --> 2593.07
right yeah an equality yeah Rob is Rob

2583.95 --> 2595.3799999999997
is okay he's cool you know some personal

2593.07 --> 2597.48
things details you know what Who am I

2595.38 --> 2600.48
you know he's he's doing what he's doing

2597.48 --> 2601.26
and he's doing it the way that he thinks

2600.48 --> 2603.84
is right

2601.26 --> 2607.44
or that his thinks is okay or should be

2603.84 --> 2609.48
so yeah he's just doing what he does and

2607.44 --> 2613.02
I'm gonna be doing it the way that I do

2609.48 --> 2616.08
and I think that the way we approach the

2613.02 --> 2620.52
Bible for one is going to be like pretty

2616.08 --> 2623.9
strong in conflict probably in certain

2620.52 --> 2628.65
ways because from what I've heard he is

2623.9 --> 2631.89
he is absolutely an exoteric interpreter

2628.65 --> 2635.9100000000003
in his own way in which he has al a very

2631.89 --> 2638.73
long journey in that process so yeah I

2635.91 --> 2640.74
can't match that I have no exoteric

2638.73 --> 2643.08
journey I only have my own life to

2640.74 --> 2645.12
reflect upon and what I've read and

2643.08 --> 2650.16
understood from the essence and of

2645.12 --> 2652.17
Christ and all that so yeah right guns

2650.16 --> 2658.2
nephron yeah well Rob look you know

2652.17 --> 2660.87
Rob's Kiva he's never even been like a

2658.2 --> 2663.54
probably how how do you say that a front

2660.87 --> 2665.2799999999997
line flat earther that much it took him

2663.54 --> 2669.0
a long time to even get to Flat Earth

2665.28 --> 2670.4700000000003
and then eventually he ended up just not

2669.0 --> 2672.45
wanting to talk about it too much

2670.47 --> 2677.0699999999997
because it was triggering too many

2672.45 --> 2679.5
people you know so he's like a silent

2677.07 --> 2680.82
flat earther more more like Patricia

2679.5 --> 2683.22
stare I guess

2680.82 --> 2686.28
they pretty much came in the same period

2683.22 --> 2688.5899999999997
and yeah that's I think that's how he's

2686.28 --> 2690.0600000000004
doing it so he's not rejecting flat

2688.59 --> 2691.65
earth he just doesn't really want to

2690.06 --> 2694.65
talk about it because everybody goes

2691.65 --> 2696.69
nuts which is very understandable

2694.65 --> 2700.26
because especially among Christians

2696.69 --> 2701.55
there is a lot of globe indoctrination

2700.26 --> 2707.19
that has sneaked in there

2701.55 --> 2710.88
a lot of it by individuals deciding that

2707.19 --> 2713.13
they will do that to save Christianity

2710.88 --> 2715.32
by bringing science in their minds

2713.13 --> 2717.12
they're literally unknowing infiltrant

2715.32 --> 2720.51
most of them and some of them may even

2717.12 --> 2723.62
be sponsored through tax [ __ ] or

2720.51 --> 2726.69
whatever it I don't know how that works

2723.62 --> 2728.49
but like even here when I went to the

2726.69 --> 2730.77
Mormon Church right across that's now

2728.49 --> 2731.43
still closed by the way for no good

2730.77 --> 2734.61
reason

2731.43 --> 2740.2999999999997
right because it should be open big

2734.61 --> 2743.94
disappointment for me towards them but

2740.3 --> 2746.82
my point again yeah in there even when I

2743.94 --> 2749.88
went there still on a weekly basis which

2746.82 --> 2752.01
was like over a year there were days

2749.88 --> 2754.26
when this guy would just start to

2752.01 --> 2756.09
blabber on about planet nonsense

2754.26 --> 2758.67
literally he would just start to bring

2756.09 --> 2761.4900000000002
in stupid planet mountains because yeah

2758.67 --> 2765.4700000000003
for some it is what they learn in school

2761.49 --> 2765.47
and then I was like this is wrong and

2765.56 --> 2770.82
they were shocked like they were

2769.11 --> 2771.6600000000003
eventually like you can't talk about

2770.82 --> 2775.26
that

2771.66 --> 2778.23
like you can't confront the main person

2775.26 --> 2780.5400000000004
about that they were basically

2778.23 --> 2782.85
responding hostile to my inquiry say

2780.54 --> 2784.95
like no the earth is absolutely not a

2782.85 --> 2788.52
globe it's scientifically impossible I

2784.95 --> 2790.6099999999997
was like that was the first that was the

2788.52 --> 2793.73
first year of the Flat Earth debates

2790.61 --> 2796.4100000000003
from the first to the second year I

2793.73 --> 2798.78
pretty much went to that church every

2796.41 --> 2804.48
week and yeah Flat Earth debate was on

2798.78 --> 2808.9900000000002
my mind Lots and I even had certain

2804.48 --> 2812.71
people there which I yak talked about it

2808.99 --> 2816.339
but you had the main people running that

2812.71 --> 2820.48
church they were really Pro glow oh no

2816.339 --> 2823.21
no not Flat Earth oh no so yeah that was

2820.48 --> 2825.94
already like oh god really and this is

2823.21 --> 2828.9700000000003
this is supposed to be a church of the

2825.94 --> 2831.91
truth right but you'll still teach the

2828.97 --> 2833.98
freaking globe in the church but I

2831.91 --> 2842.859
thought that was an abomination and I

2833.98 --> 2846.839
expressed that so so yeah you know the

2842.859 --> 2846.839
globe is sneaking back into the church

2876.43 --> 2886.22
right against never wolfurio is that

2881.24 --> 2888.9199999999996
even real you know so many of these

2886.22 --> 2892.3999999999996
people is polish out there they're just

2888.92 --> 2895.85
saying like I've done this I have this

2892.4 --> 2898.46
degree I have this and you know at this

2895.85 --> 2903.56
point I literally don't even believe

2898.46 --> 2907.58
that anymore I don't believe it anymore

2903.56 --> 2909.86
that that that's even real if somebody's

2907.58 --> 2911.39
gonna say I'm this I'm that I'm from the

2909.86 --> 2912.77
glower side I'm gonna be like oh really

2911.39 --> 2916.43
what why did you present the proof

2912.77 --> 2919.13
because pretty much everyone on your

2916.43 --> 2922.7599999999998
side of the argument here are turning

2919.13 --> 2925.4900000000002
out to be complete scam artists

2922.76 --> 2928.4900000000002
pretenders that have nothing and are

2925.49 --> 2930.6189999999997
literally making everything up from

2928.49 --> 2932.4799999999996
scratch about their entire life and

2930.619 --> 2935.51
reputation and [ __ ] they're all making

2932.48 --> 2937.73
it completely up from scratch I don't

2935.51 --> 2941.5400000000004
even think that anybody of them even has

2937.73 --> 2944.93
any degrees really at this point I don't

2941.54 --> 2947.869
think they have it they're just making

2944.93 --> 2950.06
it up they already knew yeah we can make

2947.869 --> 2951.9500000000003
up whatever the [ __ ] we want because

2950.06 --> 2954.77
we're fighting flat earth and then it's

2951.95 --> 2958.1
okay to be a complete scam artist fraud

2954.77 --> 2963.32
I think that that is actually probably

2958.1 --> 2966.71
the reality Pingping break it break the

2963.32 --> 2968.6000000000004
spell people figure it out they're not

2966.71 --> 2971.27
just liars their problem they've

2968.6 --> 2973.46
probably made up their entire lives that

2971.27 --> 2976.7599999999998
they've kind of used as some kind of

2973.46 --> 2981.92
virtual way to elbow their way up to the

2976.76 --> 2984.46
the globe authority pyramids top

2981.92 --> 2988.33
I think they've literally made up

2984.46 --> 2990.95
everything so for all these people all

2988.33 --> 2993.77
of them

2990.95 --> 2998.1189999999997
I don't think they they have degrees I

2993.77 --> 3001.96
don't think they have anything you know

2998.119 --> 3004.9
but maybe George Netanyahu has a degree

3001.96 --> 3007.66
maybe but yeah he's slided down pretty

3004.9 --> 3010.03
damn deep but the way he's explained

3007.66 --> 3012.04
certain things that gives me the

3010.03 --> 3015.0600000000004
impression that he kind of does have to

3012.04 --> 3018.2799999999997
bring for it it's just rearranged

3015.06 --> 3020.47
anyways you know but I think the

3018.28 --> 3023.02
majority of the globe is out there that

3020.47 --> 3027.7
are just like done this I've done that

3023.02 --> 3029.44
it's a bluff I don't believe [ __ ] you

3027.7 --> 3035.68
know they could have literally made all

3029.44 --> 3037.78
that [ __ ] up just even like oh I've got

3035.68 --> 3039.25
all this equipment oh really so do you

3037.78 --> 3042.099
have that equipment because it's your

3039.25 --> 3044.05
job or because I'm freaking Bank are

3042.099 --> 3045.4300000000003
told you okay you need to destroy the

3044.05 --> 3047.5
globe there's no matter the cost you're

3045.43 --> 3050.02
gonna make up your entire life I'm just

3047.5 --> 3053.47
gonna give you a million to buy whatever

3050.02 --> 3056.44
you need to make it real and you're

3053.47 --> 3058.2099999999996
gonna be this new Astro guy or whatever

3056.44 --> 3061.18
and yeah you'll have whatever you need

3058.21 --> 3064.15
and just make up whatever the [ __ ] you

3061.18 --> 3067.54
want we'll all sign it we'll sign what

3064.15 --> 3069.2200000000003
you have all this it's okay because

3067.54 --> 3072.4
we're in a hurry so hurry up we need

3069.22 --> 3073.839
globe experts quickly and we have a lot

3072.4 --> 3076.869
of money available for this you know

3073.839 --> 3079.839
space force budget and all so yeah make

3076.869 --> 3081.609
it happen make it background make a sort

3079.839 --> 3084.04
of a story we'll double-check it your

3081.609 --> 3086.14
business plan on who you're acting to be

3084.04 --> 3087.43
and the degrees you have and see if

3086.14 --> 3089.8289999999997
that's possible what you'll need for

3087.43 --> 3093.79
that you don't actually have to go

3089.829 --> 3096.25
through the education so yeah make it

3093.79 --> 3100.66
happen will sign whatever cheque you

3096.25 --> 3104.28
need I think that might actually be

3100.66 --> 3107.6189999999997
happening on the globe or side

3104.28 --> 3109.48
especially with the more new players

3107.619 --> 3113.71
come on the scene the worse it gets and

3109.48 --> 3115.51
I think that you know I don't even want

3113.71 --> 3119.349
to point at people at this point anymore

3115.51 --> 3121.01
for this but it could almost point at

3119.349 --> 3128.8590000000004
anyone

3121.01 --> 3135.3500000000004
Brenda zanuck yeah fight the flat earth

3128.859 --> 3137.39
simon dan the professor dave idiot of

3135.35 --> 3142.94
course they'll believe he's a professor

3137.39 --> 3145.2799999999997
man and yeah ten others ten others you

3142.94 --> 3146.7200000000003
know that I don't even remember because

3145.28 --> 3151.6090000000004
they just suck too much for me to

3146.72 --> 3154.7599999999998
remember I think that yeah how much

3151.609 --> 3157.49
proof has that they actually given about

3154.76 --> 3160.6400000000003
not just the lack of proof for their

3157.49 --> 3163.27
claims right right we know that but how

3160.64 --> 3166.39
about a lack of proof for their actual

3163.27 --> 3169.7
degrees and background and [ __ ] really

3166.39 --> 3173.0
the confirm the confirmation has anybody

3169.7 --> 3181.33
ever asked for it that kind of slip by

3173.0 --> 3185.24
you know is that real think about it I

3181.33 --> 3188.5699999999997
think the the con artistry goes deeper

3185.24 --> 3191.24
than we even realize because we're just

3188.57 --> 3192.77
so used to doing things as honestly as

3191.24 --> 3196.359
possible and just being straightforward

3192.77 --> 3200.21
and then you can't imagine how far a

3196.359 --> 3205.25
whole category of people can sink in

3200.21 --> 3206.93
their background scam artistry like we

3205.25 --> 3208.07
wouldn't even imagine trying to do

3206.93 --> 3211.0099999999998
something like that but the other

3208.07 --> 3213.5
there's people out there that do and I
