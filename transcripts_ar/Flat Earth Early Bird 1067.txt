84.96 --> 88.88
so i did today is

89.68 --> 93.43900000000001
big gray soup

93.759 --> 99.64
it's also almost kind of misty out there

100.96 --> 103.27999999999999
and

102.24 --> 106.079
yeah

103.28 --> 110.24
almost entirely wind still

106.079 --> 114.0
it's even more so than yesterday

110.24 --> 115.91999999999999
it's kind of cold

114.0 --> 118.399
probably also because of all the moist

115.92 --> 118.399
in the air

119.28 --> 121.52
right

124.24 --> 128.72
yeah and this this type of misty

126.799 --> 131.20000000000002
cloudiness really

128.72 --> 132.48
tends to take out the light out of the

131.2 --> 135.04
day

132.48 --> 138.48
also stood out to me yesterday

135.04 --> 138.48
because it kind of remained like that

138.64 --> 143.27999999999997
like it was just really dark throughout

141.04 --> 146.0
the entire afternoon

143.28 --> 146.0
and evening

150.16 --> 152.79999999999998
anyway

153.76 --> 156.76
uh

158.8 --> 164.64000000000001
nobody's gotten in chat just yet

162.72 --> 169.319
it's thursday

164.64 --> 169.319
the 11th of november 2021

177.68 --> 184.12
hello mike sidunich rest in chat

180.56 --> 184.12
good to see you

190.319 --> 195.92
right so yeah yesterday

193.519 --> 198.959
my show was pretty good i thought i

195.92 --> 199.76
haven't watched it back but i just yeah

198.959 --> 202.159
went

199.76 --> 202.159
great

202.239 --> 205.68
but yeah on the flat earth debate

204.879 --> 208.0
like

205.68 --> 208.0
things

209.12 --> 213.36
just didn't go the way that i thought

211.44 --> 215.2
they would

213.36 --> 216.799
i had a really good

215.2 --> 220.72
ballwin moment

216.799 --> 223.36
or i was pointing out like a

220.72 --> 227.84
a consistency within the aberration of

223.36 --> 227.84
the presuppositional ball structure

228.56 --> 233.84
and just me playing around but for some

230.72 --> 233.84
reason it like

235.28 --> 239.28
well i don't know if you've watched flat

237.2 --> 242.48
earth debate

239.28 --> 245.12
but yeah nathan didn't want any of it

242.48 --> 248.48
and i got kind of pissed off from that

245.12 --> 249.92000000000002
so i just left after being rumpus twice

248.48 --> 252.159
but here's the thing and you guys

249.92 --> 255.35999999999999
wouldn't have picked up on that

252.159 --> 259.199
i did come back in the after show

255.36 --> 260.47900000000004
and nathan immediately apologized

259.199 --> 261.759
right

260.479 --> 265.36
but

261.759 --> 266.96000000000004
yeah that didn't seem to stop the rest

265.36 --> 270.639
of the panel

266.96 --> 273.919
to like really go after me and i

270.639 --> 277.6
exploded i i literally

273.919 --> 277.59999999999997
i was so fed up with that [ __ ]

277.919 --> 281.28
because i they were literally telling me

280.479 --> 283.44
like

281.28 --> 285.75899999999996
yeah you're always doing that thing with

283.44 --> 288.479
bowen basically saying we don't want

285.759 --> 288.47900000000004
that anymore

290.4 --> 294.79999999999995
like i was getting in the way doing that

294.96 --> 300.88
and

297.759 --> 304.08000000000004
right i wasn't really in the best of

300.88 --> 307.12
moods to to just make proper judgment at

304.08 --> 309.12
that point so i just i really got

307.12 --> 312.08
i blew up

309.12 --> 312.08
got butthurt

313.199 --> 317.44
america said what kind of thing is that

315.039 --> 317.44
to say

321.039 --> 325.84
i mean i was literally attacked on my

323.12 --> 325.84000000000003
character

329.6 --> 335.759
and [ __ ] from like outside of everything

333.36 --> 339.12
outside of the actual debate got dragged

335.759 --> 342.40000000000003
in there too

339.12 --> 346.199
so yeah i want you to justify that

342.4 --> 346.19899999999996
america silver patriot

358.479 --> 362.71999999999997
i mean if you would be doing a show for

361.12 --> 364.88
like

362.72 --> 368.24
years

364.88 --> 369.84
daily with other people and you did your

368.24 --> 372.56
best to kind of like

369.84 --> 374.79999999999995
find a niche thing to do

372.56 --> 376.88
and be productive and help teach people

374.8 --> 381.0
and then you get told like

376.88 --> 381.0
you're just in the way

387.84 --> 391.44
it would have been nice if you would

389.52 --> 394.71999999999997
have stuck around

391.44 --> 396.4
and kept to your guns

394.72 --> 399.44000000000005
yeah it would have been nice indeed but

396.4 --> 399.44
i couldn't handle it

400.56 --> 405.919
like yeah if i would have just retracted

403.039 --> 409.199
i would have felt unbelievably miserable

405.919 --> 413.12
the rest of the day

409.199 --> 417.44
i just i felt like making a stand

413.12 --> 417.44
and i didn't really do that effectively

418.96 --> 423.19899999999996
in retrospect and i'm kind of

420.88 --> 424.639
embarrassed about that and i went like

423.199 --> 427.12
yeah well i

424.639 --> 428.72
i said something to 10th man in the heat

427.12 --> 431.599
of the moment that i regret and i

428.72 --> 434.08000000000004
apologized profusely

431.599 --> 434.08
for that

434.56 --> 439.52
when i came back as well

436.88 --> 441.84
but that didn't seem to stop anything

439.52 --> 441.84
though

443.759 --> 448.16
so

445.84 --> 449.75899999999996
was it 10th and paul oh no paula wasn't

448.16 --> 452.16
in there but 10th

449.759 --> 454.24
dragged her in dragged that situation

452.16 --> 456.72
into yeah

454.24 --> 460.479
i think we just wouldn't back down i was

456.72 --> 460.47900000000004
literally asking could you please stop

461.52 --> 464.639
like

462.319 --> 466.72
assaulting my character and he just

464.639 --> 469.52
wouldn't do it

466.72 --> 471.84000000000003
and he literally like actively tried to

469.52 --> 473.919
trigger me to make me blow up and then

471.84 --> 478.31899999999996
point at me oh see look he's so out of

473.919 --> 480.71999999999997
control he did that constantly

478.319 --> 481.84000000000003
he didn't help to calm me down he didn't

480.72 --> 483.84000000000003
respect

481.84 --> 486.71999999999997
anything about

483.84 --> 489.84
like me in that moment

486.72 --> 489.84000000000003
so i i lost it

491.199 --> 496.08000000000004
nathan is an asshat

493.919 --> 496.08
no

497.52 --> 502.0
no he actually apologized to me

500.24 --> 502.879
right and he

502.0 --> 505.12
made

502.879 --> 508.319
note he like made no

505.12 --> 509.28000000000003
note of it that he understood what was

508.319 --> 513.12
wrong

509.28 --> 513.12
i actually really respected that

515.44 --> 518.9190000000001
it wasn't him

520.479 --> 525.6
not on the show he did yeah right at

522.479 --> 529.44
first yeah he rumpus me twice

525.6 --> 532.64
completely unnecessarily really

529.44 --> 537.2790000000001
and i got triggered and but i left right

532.64 --> 537.279
i left isn't that the right thing to do

537.68 --> 542.0799999999999
nobody

538.8 --> 542.0799999999999
said anything about that

542.56 --> 546.3199999999999
anyway

543.519 --> 546.32
it wasn't fun

546.48 --> 552.16
it was not fun but in the after after

550.08 --> 554.32
show after the recording stop

552.16 --> 554.3199999999999
like

554.8 --> 560.0799999999999
they cut like tense men kind of try to

558.24 --> 561.04
make amends

560.08 --> 563.9200000000001
but

561.04 --> 567.12
yeah really it's it it didn't really fix

563.92 --> 567.12
the situation like

572.56 --> 577.64
hello owls g

574.64 --> 577.64
snowbirds

591.36 --> 598.32
and stuck around kept to my guns look it

594.08 --> 602.839
was just gonna be more technical

598.32 --> 602.839
the same stuff over and over again

607.12 --> 611.2
all right yeah effectively my baldwin

610.0 --> 612.24
insights

611.2 --> 616.48
helped me

612.24 --> 619.519
realize kind of a temporary safe space

616.48 --> 621.36
in relation to this accident four ball

619.519 --> 624.24
believers

621.36 --> 625.92
and i completely covered the the yeah

624.24 --> 628.9590000000001
the

625.92 --> 631.68
the presuppositional nature of it

628.959 --> 634.0
and afterward nathan literally in the

631.68 --> 637.68
aftershow gave me respect for that right

634.0 --> 637.68
so yeah i nathan

638.079 --> 640.8
i have no

642.48 --> 648.9590000000001
yeah no bad feelings towards him because

644.88 --> 648.959
he he fixed it

649.12 --> 653.279
but then the rest started to unload

654.079 --> 659.04
and yeah

656.8 --> 661.5999999999999
i got yeah i got very triggered because

659.04 --> 663.76
that remind that [ __ ] reminded me i

661.6 --> 666.0
guess back from

663.76 --> 667.519
when i was a kid at school where

666.0 --> 669.76
sometimes

667.519 --> 672.72
i'd be in kind of these types of

669.76 --> 675.6
a little bit more oversensitive moods

672.72 --> 679.44
and then everybody would just like band

675.6 --> 683.36
together and pile against me the batman

679.44 --> 686.839
and they would literally say it in group

683.36 --> 689.92
to my face and [ __ ]

686.839 --> 690.8000000000001
and that doesn't like

689.92 --> 693.12
oh

690.8 --> 694.7199999999999
maybe i'm the bad no it just really

693.12 --> 696.72
enrages me

694.72 --> 698.5600000000001
like why won't you just leave me alone

696.72 --> 700.9590000000001
let me calm down

698.56 --> 704.3199999999999
like i know i'm not in

700.959 --> 705.1999999999999
in the most stable of moods

704.32 --> 708.6400000000001
but

705.2 --> 712.399
like that's not nice to just

708.64 --> 715.399
start throwing rocks at me

712.399 --> 715.399
metaphorically

716.16 --> 718.399
right

718.72 --> 722.9590000000001
and they're all

721.2 --> 725.76
doing like

722.959 --> 727.92
what i do being a bit rumpus that goes

725.76 --> 730.079
up and down and like normally that's

727.92 --> 731.68
even recognized like yeah everybody has

730.079 --> 733.68
their moods

731.68 --> 736.2399999999999
but they just threw it at me like

733.68 --> 738.4799999999999
everything you've done is just in the

736.24 --> 741.44
way and a burden to us that's how they

738.48 --> 743.36
presented it in that moment it's just

741.44 --> 747.12
a grief is insult

743.36 --> 747.12
like really insulting

747.6 --> 753.36
like how do i not explode in the face of

750.8 --> 756.56
my colleagues basically telling me i'm

753.36 --> 758.9590000000001
in the way and completely useless

756.56 --> 761.5999999999999
i'm just a disruptive factor like and

758.959 --> 761.5999999999999
not just like

762.24 --> 766.0790000000001
today

763.36 --> 767.36
or some days but just like oh the last

766.079 --> 769.12
month

767.36 --> 770.9590000000001
oh thanks

769.12 --> 773.2
so you're saying like oh it would have

770.959 --> 775.3599999999999
been better if you just not come on for

773.2 --> 778.24
like a month because apparently in the

775.36 --> 782.279
last month i've only been in the way i'm

778.24 --> 782.279
such a burden to everybody

803.68 --> 806.8
it helps me be

807.04 --> 813.519
new to science to hear more points of

810.0 --> 815.839
view and opinions what

813.519 --> 818.16
well yeah i try to bring that in all the

815.839 --> 821.1990000000001
time

818.16 --> 822.399
right i blatantly try to

821.199 --> 824.16
take

822.399 --> 826.24
an odd position

824.16 --> 829.279
and not just be like oh yeah yeah yeah

826.24 --> 831.519
i'm not a freaking yes man

829.279 --> 832.959
like there's no real opposition from the

831.519 --> 837.16
ballers coming in

832.959 --> 837.16
so i emulate a baller

850.959 --> 855.5999999999999
right but they were

852.72 --> 858.72
throwing it at me like i was

855.6 --> 858.72
only disruptive

859.839 --> 865.0400000000001
and i mean like if i had been

862.8 --> 866.8
if it was like after the situation had

865.04 --> 869.76
been amended and they tell me like yeah

866.8 --> 872.399
sometimes you can be a bit disruptive

869.76 --> 875.6
let's see yeah yeah i know you know my

872.399 --> 876.56
mood sometimes makes me

875.6 --> 878.88
like

876.56 --> 880.7199999999999
almost step on people's toes and and

878.88 --> 882.56
then in that moment i kind of don't care

880.72 --> 885.519
because i'm just like no i have to make

882.56 --> 888.8
some moves i have to do something i

885.519 --> 891.519
can't always just stand by and be afraid

888.8 --> 893.3599999999999
to step on toes because i'll become too

891.519 --> 896.079
freaking passive and then nothing will

893.36 --> 899.399
come out of me

896.079 --> 899.399
like nothing

902.639 --> 908.44
and it's like yeah they all have their

905.44 --> 908.44
dynamics

913.519 --> 919.12
i don't know it's just

915.279 --> 919.12
the whole thing was very aggravating

922.8 --> 927.8389999999999
but yeah hopefully today things will be

925.519 --> 927.839
different

932.56 --> 936.199
hello michael khan

953.36 --> 961.279
residual from infighting cut

955.92 --> 961.279
well that's a bit of a stretch lg but

962.24 --> 967.519
yeah sort of

964.24 --> 970.48
rv is certainly not helping

967.519 --> 973.68
he is the tip of the spear of flattered

970.48 --> 975.36
infighting at this at this time and it's

973.68 --> 978.399
embarrassing to say that a whole bunch

975.36 --> 981.8000000000001
of people are siding with him

978.399 --> 981.8
and that's like

982.56 --> 986.0
i

983.279 --> 988.399
i don't want to get into it too detailed

986.0 --> 991.44
i think that

988.399 --> 992.32
well there was another stream

991.44 --> 994.48
with

992.32 --> 997.279
uh

994.48 --> 999.279
jaren and david wise and karen b was in

997.279 --> 1001.519
there and alex steen

999.279 --> 1004.72
and they discussed it

1001.519 --> 1004.72
for what it is really

1006.16 --> 1009.279
right but they're all good

1009.519 --> 1013.92
it's

1010.88 --> 1016.48
like it's not rv causing it he is just

1013.92 --> 1018.639
kind of like

1016.48 --> 1020.399
there's gunpowder everywhere now

1018.639 --> 1023.04
everything's turned to a gunpowder and

1020.399 --> 1026.24
he is just constantly trying to ignite

1023.04 --> 1026.24
all that all of us

1026.959 --> 1030.88
by all this infighting

1028.959 --> 1033.919
and maybe that is rubbing off on some

1030.88 --> 1036.959
other people i'm actively not trying to

1033.919 --> 1038.4
do that i've been very forward from the

1036.959 --> 1040.72
start

1038.4 --> 1043.199
very critical towards like what are you

1040.72 --> 1044.319
doing dude this is total [ __ ] this

1043.199 --> 1047.6000000000001
is wrong

1044.319 --> 1049.36
this is insane this is counterproductive

1047.6 --> 1051.84
even when like

1049.36 --> 1054.08
nathan was still trying to be moderate

1051.84 --> 1056.24
about it and all that yeah that's fine

1054.08 --> 1059.28
it's nathan's

1056.24 --> 1059.28
company policy

1059.84 --> 1064.6399999999999
and i guess some people do appreciate

1062.16 --> 1068.0
the guy for some of his conspiracy

1064.64 --> 1068.0
research things i

1068.64 --> 1072.72
i'm not gonna decide with that

1079.84 --> 1084.1599999999999
and yeah i'd just like to say i was

1081.919 --> 1086.24
right from the start i called it right

1084.16 --> 1088.72
away and everybody's figuring out like

1086.24 --> 1091.52
no rv is not stopping he's literally

1088.72 --> 1095.039
just going after everybody and really

1091.52 --> 1097.36
embarrassing and

1095.039 --> 1099.039
terrible way going after the recently

1097.36 --> 1101.4399999999998
deceased

1099.039 --> 1105.6
when they've been on his show apparently

1101.44 --> 1106.05
and all that is just oh my god

1105.6 --> 1109.1999999999998
like

1106.05 --> 1109.2
[Music]

1117.44 --> 1123.8400000000001
i think he's the problem in most cases

1120.48 --> 1123.84
what are you talking about

1123.919 --> 1126.5590000000002
no way is it

1129.84 --> 1136.1599999999999
yes god did inspector i saw that

1132.48 --> 1139.2
yeah as i said there's people literally

1136.16 --> 1140.799
going for that and yeah that guy

1139.2 --> 1143.8400000000001
jake

1140.799 --> 1146.0
he's he's following in

1143.84 --> 1147.9189999999999
in our of his footsteps he's doing that

1146.0 --> 1151.72
[ __ ] too yeah

1147.919 --> 1151.72
he's not the only one

1160.48 --> 1165.84
hello good servant

1162.72 --> 1165.84
george sanford

1174.0 --> 1177.48
hello cleary

1181.52 --> 1183.84
right

1188.32 --> 1193.84
oh man

1190.08 --> 1193.84
at least i did have a good night's sleep

1205.36 --> 1207.84
what

1209.919 --> 1214.3200000000002
okay somebody came in here with a

1211.679 --> 1214.3200000000002
projection

1215.76 --> 1222.48
unless you're implying that

1218.64 --> 1223.679
people not supporting each other

1222.48 --> 1225.3600000000001
would be

1223.679 --> 1227.6000000000001
considered gay

1225.36 --> 1230.08
like per big bear's newest latest

1227.6 --> 1230.08
tradition

1230.159 --> 1235.8400000000001
otherwise i have no idea what you're

1232.08 --> 1235.84
talking about golden wonder

1247.28 --> 1252.3999999999999
yes clary i did watch like half of that

1249.6 --> 1254.32
show but i i had to go to bed like it

1252.4 --> 1256.24
was kind of late and i didn't want to

1254.32 --> 1258.96
like keep up all night

1256.24 --> 1261.2
with that stuff

1258.96 --> 1263.8400000000001
but yes i did see part of that show

1261.2 --> 1263.8400000000001
clearly

1271.28 --> 1276.3999999999999
i am the only one you're not suspect of

1274.799 --> 1278.32
what

1276.4 --> 1280.48
most of the big channels are very

1278.32 --> 1282.08
suspect

1280.48 --> 1283.919
especially ben

1282.08 --> 1287.8799999999999
liaschenko i don't know who ben

1283.919 --> 1287.88
leashanko is

1299.679 --> 1303.2
oh rv right yeah

1304.0 --> 1308.0
okay i didn't realize that

1308.559 --> 1313.76
yeah but he dude

1310.559 --> 1316.24
i think if there is any freaking agent

1313.76 --> 1320.1589999999999
of some kind out there effectively

1316.24 --> 1322.4
gatekeeping yeah it's freaking rv man

1320.159 --> 1322.4
like

1323.2 --> 1327.76
doesn't mean that he is

1325.039 --> 1330.799
but if there would be one he kind of

1327.76 --> 1330.799
fits the profile

1330.88 --> 1336.159
gatekeeping sewing paranoia creating

1333.44 --> 1336.159
infighting

1339.36 --> 1345.799
has he ever shown his face no he hasn't

1342.799 --> 1345.799
ever

1356.159 --> 1360.5590000000002
right

1357.6 --> 1363.76
it's a zealous truther that never

1360.559 --> 1363.76
reveals who he is

1366.96 --> 1372.28
he's shown his face years ago oh really

1374.559 --> 1377.44
where when

1378.24 --> 1383.52
i mean if he had then people would be

1380.4 --> 1383.52
able to dig that up

1385.919 --> 1390.4
ben leashank on facebook has this

1387.919 --> 1391.3600000000001
picture he does okay well i can't go

1390.4 --> 1393.6000000000001
there

1391.36 --> 1397.84
but

1393.6 --> 1397.84
i mean is that page even still up

1399.36 --> 1404.9189999999999
that's right rv is not rowdy rowdy piper

1416.88 --> 1423.2
you can dig it up if are bothered well

1420.159 --> 1423.2
you could dig it up

1425.52 --> 1431.559
like i i can't get on facebook and i

1428.559 --> 1431.559
won't

1432.64 --> 1439.3200000000002
but hey i'm surprised that nobody's

1435.12 --> 1439.32
shoved it in my face yet

1444.159 --> 1449.7600000000002
sure does have government

1446.4 --> 1452.24
okay george sanford well maybe he does i

1449.76 --> 1452.24
don't know

1453.84 --> 1459.559
all i know is just like the average of

1456.08 --> 1459.559
what he is doing

1477.919 --> 1485.5590000000002
oh really patricia steer came on there

1482.559 --> 1485.559
huh

1492.48 --> 1497.799
oh i completely missed that part max

1494.799 --> 1497.799
dunich

1509.679 --> 1512.679
hmm

1524.4 --> 1528.5590000000002
all right well guys you suspected to me

1526.08 --> 1530.8799999999999
russian fitz like he was the guy i

1528.559 --> 1532.96
associate most directly

1530.88 --> 1537.2
with inserting the

1532.96 --> 1537.2
no trees on flat earth videos

1537.6 --> 1542.84
like he was really on to that at the

1539.84 --> 1542.84
time

1547.279 --> 1551.84
that's kind of like my first

1550.0 --> 1554.32
association

1551.84 --> 1557.84
the first realization like that who this

1554.32 --> 1557.84
guy is and

1597.76 --> 1601.919
ugh anyway

1600.08 --> 1604.6399999999999
yeah

1601.919 --> 1608.6000000000001
so a whole bunch of drama stuff

1604.64 --> 1608.6000000000001
yesterday overall

1614.48 --> 1623.64
harvey's actually some dumb guy what

1619.679 --> 1623.64
what are you talking about cleary

1628.24 --> 1632.559
oh yeah i get the inspector yeah yeah

1630.64 --> 1634.24
yeah don't worry about it yet tony is

1632.559 --> 1635.84
totally on that

1634.24 --> 1638.72
but that

1635.84 --> 1643.32
well philosophical struggle has been

1638.72 --> 1643.32
going on for quite some time

1655.2 --> 1660.24
all right but i don't really follow or

1657.679 --> 1662.88
subscribe so i didn't get in you know

1660.24 --> 1665.36
like i don't

1662.88 --> 1666.159
when it gets brought up then i'll take a

1665.36 --> 1668.9599999999998
look

1666.159 --> 1671.5200000000002
but i don't really dig

1668.96 --> 1674.3990000000001
everywhere especially not to see oh

1671.52 --> 1677.44
they've they got it wrong now

1674.399 --> 1679.6
let me make a video about it i know the

1677.44 --> 1682.159
other guys a lot of them really like to

1679.6 --> 1685.52
do that and they do it pretty decently

1682.159 --> 1688.88
and it it it is it its own thing

1685.52 --> 1691.2
it's just not really my thing

1688.88 --> 1691.2
you know

1692.32 --> 1698.0
i give my opinions about those they just

1694.96 --> 1699.8400000000001
you don't need to review the video just

1698.0 --> 1702.399
lay it out

1699.84 --> 1705.4399999999998
verbally

1702.399 --> 1708.08
and then just yeah to keep it as clear

1705.44 --> 1708.0800000000002
as possible

1709.36 --> 1716.279
then i insert my input that's it

1712.48 --> 1716.279
that's how i do things

1747.679 --> 1750.0
what

1751.2 --> 1757.52
at the fe last meetup

1755.2 --> 1757.52
what

1757.919 --> 1764.159
oh you mean it was a recorded

1759.919 --> 1764.159
presentation from a meetup

1764.72 --> 1767.72
okay

1774.88 --> 1777.1200000000001
right

1793.039 --> 1797.039
anyway yeah uh

1795.279 --> 1800.0
i also checked out mitchell from

1797.039 --> 1801.36
australia stream yesterday and that was

1800.0 --> 1803.84
pretty cool

1801.36 --> 1806.399
and i don't know mitchell is really in

1803.84 --> 1808.48
getting in the summer spirit

1806.399 --> 1810.8799999999999
the australian summer spirit because

1808.48 --> 1812.32
he's like

1810.88 --> 1815.2
he's now like

1812.32 --> 1817.279
sort of coming after anti-flat earthers

1815.2 --> 1821.0800000000002
like he's like ready to

1817.279 --> 1821.08
to play with him

1825.76 --> 1829.919
and i think that he's holding his man

1830.48 --> 1835.6
like mitch from australia is a guy that

1832.96 --> 1838.799
has a lot of energy

1835.6 --> 1840.8799999999999
and they respect that sometimes though i

1838.799 --> 1842.72
get tendency to like dude dude take it

1840.88 --> 1844.5590000000002
easy

1842.72 --> 1848.32
you might be a little bit too over

1844.559 --> 1848.32
enthusiastic about this or

1849.2 --> 1852.3990000000001
it's like almost too

1854.559 --> 1860.0
too positive to be realistic sometimes

1857.2 --> 1863.6000000000001
that's the sense i get of him but he's

1860.0 --> 1865.6
it's working out fine all of it really

1863.6 --> 1868.9599999999998
i think he's a real asset

1865.6 --> 1868.9599999999998
to the flat earth community

1869.44 --> 1872.0800000000002
in general

1875.519 --> 1881.679
is he ready to play it's not a game no

1878.96 --> 1884.159
when i mean that when i say that i mean

1881.679 --> 1887.2
he's just he has energy and he's like

1884.159 --> 1887.2
wanting to go at it

1887.36 --> 1892.6399999999999
just take on anti-flat earther nonsense

1890.24 --> 1894.48
accusations because he has a pretty

1892.64 --> 1897.039
sharp oversight

1894.48 --> 1899.44
he is actually pretty talented at

1897.039 --> 1901.44
working through machinations

1899.44 --> 1904.64
and not letting it rub off on him not

1901.44 --> 1908.64
getting distracted by it

1904.64 --> 1914.0
so he is right now just engaging

1908.64 --> 1914.0
yeah weirdos out there like mr sensible

1915.44 --> 1921.64
and they are biting

1917.44 --> 1921.64
they are doing what they do

1924.96 --> 1930.0
he has his game face on kind of game

1928.64 --> 1932.0800000000002
okay

1930.0 --> 1936.24
not sure what that means but

1932.08 --> 1936.24
if that means what i said then yeah

1937.6 --> 1943.519
i don't think anyone is proven what the

1940.24 --> 1943.519
[ __ ] get out of here

1944.159 --> 1947.88
stupid troll

1949.12 --> 1951.9189999999999
ridiculous

1957.919 --> 1964.24
that's stupid type of gas lighting

1960.159 --> 1966.24
nonsense it's uh yeah

1964.24 --> 1970.159
i'm not

1966.24 --> 1970.159
gonna let that linger in here

1971.36 --> 1977.519
no mitchell's ace he's doing great

1974.08 --> 1980.1589999999999
he's great spirit good will

1977.519 --> 1983.039
lots of energy

1980.159 --> 1984.72
yeah and especially in a time

1983.039 --> 1986.64
where a lot of us

1984.72 --> 1988.799
european and

1986.64 --> 1990.88
north of the equator folk are kind of

1988.799 --> 1993.679
like in the middle of ancestral wind

1990.88 --> 1995.919
situations so

1993.679 --> 1995.919
no

1999.039 --> 2003.799
get contained silly

2000.799 --> 2003.799
lg

2016.159 --> 2019.24
all right

2025.679 --> 2028.72
i

2026.48 --> 2031.6
i don't know by the way why

2028.72 --> 2034.799
i sent jaren this email

2031.6 --> 2036.559
i told you guys about it a few days ago

2034.799 --> 2040.72
like could you please unblock i haven't

2036.559 --> 2040.72
had no response i don't understand

2042.399 --> 2046.6
like is he avoiding me

2055.04 --> 2059.679
or is that email just so filled with

2057.839 --> 2062.48
spam that he doesn't check it anyway i

2059.679 --> 2062.48
don't understand

2066.879 --> 2072.159
or maybe like

2069.359 --> 2075.159
like the spam filter is extremely

2072.159 --> 2075.159
rough

2075.679 --> 2080.7200000000003
i

2076.72 --> 2083.6789999999996
didn't feel like i inserted

2080.72 --> 2085.52
details that would be typically

2083.679 --> 2088.8
caught in

2085.52 --> 2091.839
spam filters but yeah i don't know man

2088.8 --> 2094.079
but i'm still like blocked over on his

2091.839 --> 2095.839
chat and i'm kind of disappointed at it

2094.079 --> 2097.52
i don't know why

2095.839 --> 2100.32
don't know what i ever did to really

2097.52 --> 2103.32
deserve that i've usually been very

2100.32 --> 2103.32
supporting

2104.48 --> 2108.4
of gerund and dave

2115.2 --> 2120.7999999999997
yes gadget inspector absolutely and

2117.119 --> 2122.96
that's a sign that he's done a great job

2120.8 --> 2125.2000000000003
dude they they've done that with me as

2122.96 --> 2125.2
well

2126.4 --> 2129.52
worse even

2127.92 --> 2132.32
remember that i don't know if you've

2129.52 --> 2135.52
seen it but i i got onto

2132.32 --> 2137.599
mr sensible ugh

2135.52 --> 2139.44
i'm not gonna go after i'm not even

2137.599 --> 2142.7200000000003
gonna go into character analysis because

2139.44 --> 2142.7200000000003
that's gonna get really

2143.76 --> 2148.2400000000002
like that guy's a creep

2146.16 --> 2151.359
a genuine creep

2148.24 --> 2154.3999999999996
not necessarily evil

2151.359 --> 2156.4
death oriented creep but pretty much

2154.4 --> 2158.88
everything else creep

2156.4 --> 2161.52
but that we supposedly had a civil

2158.88 --> 2162.88
conversation live streamed

2161.52 --> 2165.599
and he

2162.88 --> 2167.119
neutral subjects right i specified like

2165.599 --> 2169.92
i don't want to like

2167.119 --> 2173.8
globe versus flat earth like more about

2169.92 --> 2173.8
cosmogeny and

2174.0 --> 2178.32
and new ideas

2175.76 --> 2180.7200000000003
and then he would ask me things and then

2178.32 --> 2183.28
literally as i responded

2180.72 --> 2185.7599999999998
start playing sound bites

2183.28 --> 2187.599
over me

2185.76 --> 2188.88
like

2187.599 --> 2190.079
immediately

2188.88 --> 2191.92
live

2190.079 --> 2196.0
and didn't tell me

2191.92 --> 2200.16
it's absolutely idiotic

2196.0 --> 2203.68
the guy is a freak a genuine freak mr

2200.16 --> 2203.68
sensible is a freak

2212.64 --> 2217.68
and he is one of the most senseless

2215.52 --> 2220.64
ballers specifically about

2217.68 --> 2223.64
sensibility right or he is absolutely

2220.64 --> 2223.64
insensible

2232.0 --> 2239.24
hey get out

2234.64 --> 2239.24
you're not welcome piss off

2242.64 --> 2247.7999999999997
don't you be throwing sock accounts at

2244.8 --> 2247.8
us

2273.119 --> 2277.44
i don't know how many soccer cards you

2274.8 --> 2278.8
got but i'm blocking them all you don't

2277.44 --> 2283.56
you're a gamma

2278.8 --> 2283.5600000000004
you understand you're not welcome here

2302.4 --> 2306.92
yeah yeah i'll see i got that

2324.96 --> 2329.359
yeah fighter flat earth is a real piece

2326.96 --> 2329.359
of work

2329.52 --> 2336.48
i don't know conspiracy cats mctoon like

2332.64 --> 2336.48
they're part of the clique too but

2337.76 --> 2343.5200000000004
but not that bad right

2340.72 --> 2345.9199999999996
i mean like there's like different

2343.52 --> 2347.599
levels of nasty within the anti-flat

2345.92 --> 2350.0
earth community

2347.599 --> 2351.6800000000003
and like

2350.0 --> 2355.28
fight the flat earth

2351.68 --> 2358.24
it and mr sensible are like definitely

2355.28 --> 2359.28
right up there at the nasty nasty top

2358.24 --> 2361.839
like

2359.28 --> 2361.8390000000004
really

2362.8 --> 2368.0
just so nasty right but people like cats

2366.079 --> 2370.4
and mattoon they're much more like

2368.0 --> 2373.44
genuine zealots and they have character

2370.4 --> 2375.359
misbehaviors and they have dwellings

2373.44 --> 2378.64
and they have nastiness but that's no

2375.359 --> 2380.839
they're not like really sny the nasty

2378.64 --> 2382.7999999999997
constantly

2380.839 --> 2384.25
right

2382.8 --> 2387.38
get out

2384.25 --> 2387.38
[Music]

2397.599 --> 2402.7200000000003
well yeah cats has his own

2400.64 --> 2406.0
like they do have severe issues in ways

2402.72 --> 2406.0
right it's just that

2408.319 --> 2411.44
i hope you understand like the

2410.24 --> 2413.9199999999996
difference of what i'm trying to

2411.44 --> 2413.92
highlight

2419.52 --> 2425.44
he was in jake's channel

2422.72 --> 2428.48
yeah the dude when when there's

2425.44 --> 2431.68
infighting around you bet your ass rant

2428.48 --> 2431.68
is gonna be right on it

2432.48 --> 2436.96
like he thinks he's like

2434.88 --> 2438.96
one of i think he probably secretly

2436.96 --> 2441.92
thinks that he's like one of the four

2438.96 --> 2443.359
horsemen of the apocalypse of flat earth

2441.92 --> 2447.76
the war

2443.359 --> 2451.2
he likes to f and fi like unroll wars

2447.76 --> 2453.0400000000004
he even did that sort of [ __ ]

2451.2 --> 2457.24
when he was still supposedly on the

2453.04 --> 2457.24
flatter side he had that tendency

2466.88 --> 2471.76
not a fan of fight the flat earth to

2468.8 --> 2474.96
anger no it's not the anger it's

2471.76 --> 2477.2000000000003
the nastiness gamma

2474.96 --> 2479.7200000000003
just that

2477.2 --> 2483.52
standardized acceptance that

2479.72 --> 2487.2799999999997
backstabbing socially is the way to go

2483.52 --> 2489.68
that's nastiness right

2487.28 --> 2491.2000000000003
that they don't even see that that's

2489.68 --> 2493.5989999999997
really nasty

2491.2 --> 2495.359
that that's normal to them that's

2493.599 --> 2498.56
fight the flat earth

2495.359 --> 2500.96
that's mr sensible

2498.56 --> 2502.56
and and that's not that's really where

2500.96 --> 2503.68
it becomes slightly different with

2502.56 --> 2505.68
mctoon

2503.68 --> 2508.64
and conspiracy cats they only do that

2505.68 --> 2512.16
sort of [ __ ] when you really

2508.64 --> 2514.319
push them like start to basically attack

2512.16 --> 2517.2799999999997
their character or like make it really

2514.319 --> 2520.16
tough on them then they might go there

2517.28 --> 2522.7200000000003
but mr sensible fight to flare they just

2520.16 --> 2524.64
do it automatically

2522.72 --> 2527.52
all the time

2524.64 --> 2527.52
that's the difference

2530.319 --> 2535.2
randy was upset when jake didn't even

2532.4 --> 2539.1600000000003
know who he was

2535.2 --> 2539.16
i bet he would be

2573.52 --> 2576.52
okay

2581.04 --> 2584.04
ugh

2595.599 --> 2597.92
ah

2599.68 --> 2601.9199999999996
but

2604.079 --> 2608.96
right it's

2606.64 --> 2610.96
i don't want to start opening wounds

2608.96 --> 2612.64
it's just that the like tenth man

2610.96 --> 2614.8
yesterday said one thing like in the

2612.64 --> 2617.68
heat of the moment

2614.8 --> 2618.8
that was so annoying

2617.68 --> 2622.48
like

2618.8 --> 2624.2400000000002
and embarrassing right he actually said

2622.48 --> 2628.0
yeah i got an

2624.24 --> 2630.3999999999996
i got a i read a comment from somebody

2628.0 --> 2633.839
i was complaining about

2630.4 --> 2636.7200000000003
why does arwen always has to be there

2633.839 --> 2640.4
he's ruining every he actually thought

2636.72 --> 2642.3999999999996
that was a an argument against me

2640.4 --> 2646.0
when trolls

2642.4 --> 2648.88
do that [ __ ] all the time

2646.0 --> 2651.48
always whining and complaining specific

2648.88 --> 2653.599
like they literally try to sow

2651.48 --> 2656.16
dissatisfaction about other people in

2653.599 --> 2659.04
the panel

2656.16 --> 2659.839
like a bunch of gammas cozying up like

2659.04 --> 2662.8
oh

2659.839 --> 2664.88
yeah i think they're really annoying too

2662.8 --> 2665.76
oh yeah we should get rid of them oh

2664.88 --> 2667.04
yeah

2665.76 --> 2669.8390000000004
like

2667.04 --> 2673.7599999999998
you can't seriously be

2669.839 --> 2677.04
referencing some random guy's comment

2673.76 --> 2679.44
about how i'm bad for the show and

2677.04 --> 2681.68
actually forward it as if it is like a

2679.44 --> 2684.8
legitimate complaint

2681.68 --> 2686.72
when he should know that everybody

2684.8 --> 2689.92
that's on that panel with nathan

2686.72 --> 2692.9599999999996
oakley's is constantly getting stalked

2689.92 --> 2695.6800000000003
and bombarded by gamma trolls that are

2692.96 --> 2698.079
trying to sow infighting

2695.68 --> 2700.16
it's blatantly obvious i can't believe

2698.079 --> 2702.96
he actually threw that out

2700.16 --> 2706.24
like it was an argument that was like

2702.96 --> 2708.56
intellectually embarrassing

2706.24 --> 2708.56
ugh

2709.04 --> 2715.2799999999997
right it's like in retrospect yeah and

2711.359 --> 2715.2799999999997
no wonder i got so freaking triggered

2715.839 --> 2719.839
still not an excuse though

2725.28 --> 2730.0
drama is no good for fe community

2728.72 --> 2732.56
no

2730.0 --> 2734.8
well i guess that maybe it is like sort

2732.56 --> 2736.0
of a brawl it does

2734.8 --> 2739.2000000000003
like

2736.0 --> 2742.64
get the adrenaline going temporarily

2739.2 --> 2745.5989999999997
but it also distracts a lot

2742.64 --> 2748.4
it distracts away from peak technical

2745.599 --> 2751.92
insight that's what drama typically does

2748.4 --> 2751.92
and that part is a problem

2754.0 --> 2757.119
right

2754.88 --> 2763.04
so pay attention

2757.119 --> 2765.2000000000003
if somebody is finding a new peak inside

2763.04 --> 2766.72
and i do that sort of thing

2765.2 --> 2769.04
sometimes

2766.72 --> 2771.52
like finding something that nobody's

2769.04 --> 2772.64
mind is even at yet but you know in the

2771.52 --> 2775.599
future

2772.64 --> 2778.0789999999997
it's probably gonna become like its

2775.599 --> 2779.599
standardized conclusion when that sort

2778.079 --> 2781.6800000000003
of thing happens

2779.599 --> 2784.2400000000002
sometimes the trolls pick up on it and

2781.68 --> 2785.1189999999997
that's when they start to like really

2784.24 --> 2788.839
take

2785.119 --> 2788.839
stabs at you

2791.28 --> 2796.5600000000004
but that's when where they try to start

2794.0 --> 2798.8
to like really throw out the seeds of

2796.56 --> 2800.52
discontent and try to make everybody

2798.8 --> 2802.599
fight against each other because they

2800.52 --> 2805.359
intuitively not even consciously

2802.599 --> 2806.6400000000003
intuitively because of their religious

2805.359 --> 2808.48
choice

2806.64 --> 2810.48
because of their base philosophy in

2808.48 --> 2812.8
their subconscious

2810.48 --> 2814.16
they know that if you just let that

2812.8 --> 2817.3590000000004
bloom

2814.16 --> 2821.2
it'll give like everybody on our side a

2817.359 --> 2822.88
huge advantage a huge leap forward

2821.2 --> 2824.72
in progression

2822.88 --> 2826.6400000000003
so that's the time when they suddenly

2824.72 --> 2829.839
start to try to make everybody

2826.64 --> 2832.0789999999997
infighting so the bloom will die out

2829.839 --> 2834.319
it's what they do this is tactical

2832.079 --> 2836.1600000000003
social engineering

2834.319 --> 2837.44
not conscious

2836.16 --> 2840.0789999999997
it's

2837.44 --> 2840.079
based on

2840.16 --> 2844.16
like

2840.88 --> 2845.599
parroting repeating

2844.16 --> 2848.7999999999997
techniques

2845.599 --> 2851.28
that are suggested that are exampled

2848.8 --> 2853.119
by potentially agents

2851.28 --> 2855.599
and some of them will never even

2853.119 --> 2858.4
necessarily know it's just like

2855.599 --> 2860.96
they roll out like tactics social

2858.4 --> 2863.599
engineering manipulative detectives that

2860.96 --> 2866.2400000000002
are kind of socially effective

2863.599 --> 2869.04
a lot of these anti-flat earthers they

2866.24 --> 2871.04
copy that behavior

2869.04 --> 2872.88
even though they don't actually

2871.04 --> 2875.359
understand what they're doing

2872.88 --> 2877.76
they like parrots just mimic it and it

2875.359 --> 2879.92
works but their conscious is never

2877.76 --> 2882.0
really pulled into the process they

2879.92 --> 2884.7200000000003
don't actually understand what they do

2882.0 --> 2887.119
when they do that you see

2884.72 --> 2889.359
they just copy

2887.119 --> 2891.92
taylor tinker tailored

2889.359 --> 2894.0789999999997
social engineering manipulative

2891.92 --> 2895.52
manipulative

2894.079 --> 2897.599
behavior

2895.52 --> 2899.68
they assimilate it without understanding

2897.599 --> 2901.28
it because it is basically just you just

2899.68 --> 2904.64
have to pay attention to certain

2901.28 --> 2907.8390000000004
feelings and then you're systematic

2904.64 --> 2909.92
about how you engage in response to that

2907.839 --> 2912.0789999999997
there's no consciousness involved in

2909.92 --> 2915.2000000000003
that doesn't have to be you just have to

2912.079 --> 2917.2000000000003
get the feel for it and mimic it so

2915.2 --> 2919.4399999999996
they're they literally

2917.2 --> 2921.2
don't understand what they do

2919.44 --> 2922.64
those trolls

2921.2 --> 2924.319
a lot of those people they don't

2922.64 --> 2926.24
understand what they're actually doing

2924.319 --> 2928.8
they don't understand how freaking

2926.24 --> 2929.68
nefarious it really is because they're

2928.8 --> 2931.76
just

2929.68 --> 2933.2
copy-pasting the behavior

2931.76 --> 2936.0
and saying oh this works i'm going to

2933.2 --> 2937.2
keep copy pasting it

2936.0 --> 2941.8
right

2937.2 --> 2941.7999999999997
that's what they do with behavior

2944.079 --> 2948.319
it's like this

2946.24 --> 2951.5989999999997
unspoken

2948.319 --> 2953.52
gamma behavior library

2951.599 --> 2955.119
that they all just keep copy pasting

2953.52 --> 2958.0
like who is the

2955.119 --> 2960.0
who is the secretest of kings who has

2958.0 --> 2962.88
destiny this tongue

2960.0 --> 2964.64
who sounds the smartest while ridiculing

2962.88 --> 2966.88
somebody else that doesn't really

2964.64 --> 2968.64
deserve it how do you do that best

2966.88 --> 2971.119
that's what they all pay attention to

2968.64 --> 2974.5589999999997
they're obsessed

2971.119 --> 2978.48
with sitting on that gamma throne

2974.559 --> 2980.6400000000003
of becoming the one secret king that can

2978.48 --> 2984.4
smooth talk his way through everything

2980.64 --> 2985.5989999999997
and make the lies into the truth and

2984.4 --> 2987.44
cut off

2985.599 --> 2990.1600000000003
those that

2987.44 --> 2991.52
that pull through it and do their own

2990.16 --> 2993.04
thing

2991.52 --> 2994.8
and they probably most of them don't

2993.04 --> 2997.8
even consciously realize what they're

2994.8 --> 2997.8
doing

2999.839 --> 3002.16
ah

3011.359 --> 3015.7599999999998
right gadget inspector

3014.0 --> 3018.96
would be better if nate didn't let the

3015.76 --> 3018.96
funniest express more

3022.079 --> 3027.8390000000004
with nathan insulting them right from

3024.0 --> 3027.839
the start but what are you talking about

3028.16 --> 3032.0789999999997
when does he do that

3029.839 --> 3034.0
he never really does that

3032.079 --> 3035.28
he always gives them some room it's just

3034.0 --> 3037.76
as soon as

3035.28 --> 3039.119
the ballers start to not answer yes or

3037.76 --> 3041.28
no questions

3039.119 --> 3044.079
then depending on how much patience he

3041.28 --> 3046.48
has at the moment

3044.079 --> 3048.6400000000003
he might start to get loud at like after

3046.48 --> 3050.319
the third question right

3048.64 --> 3052.96
when he's more patient he starts to get

3050.319 --> 3056.4
a little loud after the 10th repetition

3052.96 --> 3056.4
it all depends on his mood

3065.839 --> 3068.64
yeah

3066.88 --> 3071.359
all right guys inspector happy birthday

3068.64 --> 3071.359
with your sister

3075.68 --> 3079.52
he should give more time to the panel

3077.76 --> 3081.28
when the fundies come in that's my

3079.52 --> 3082.559
opinion

3081.28 --> 3083.76
all right

3082.559 --> 3086.96
well

3083.76 --> 3091.44
arguably gadget inspector but it is kind

3086.96 --> 3091.44
of a staple format of his show though

3095.04 --> 3102.24
nathan's rage is entertaining right

3099.76 --> 3104.4
a lot of people actually like

3102.24 --> 3107.1189999999997
listening to him do that

3104.4 --> 3109.04
myself included

3107.119 --> 3111.04
but yeah it can be frustrated if you're

3109.04 --> 3113.52
in the panel you can't really get a word

3111.04 --> 3113.52
in between

3115.04 --> 3119.119
and then everybody gets a little like

3120.16 --> 3123.839
riled up

3122.16 --> 3126.319
a little tense because of that because

3123.839 --> 3127.92
they have a lot they had couldn't get

3126.319 --> 3129.68
out

3127.92 --> 3132.16
but

3129.68 --> 3132.16
i don't know

3134.4 --> 3139.4
i mean nathan's show is what it is

3142.4 --> 3149.0
nathan oakley is an acquired taste yeah

3145.599 --> 3149.0
yeah he is

3157.92 --> 3163.92
need a revamp to win new old list well

3160.72 --> 3163.9199999999996
rick montgomery that's

3165.359 --> 3168.319
that's an opinion

3167.2 --> 3170.72
but hey

3168.319 --> 3173.04
personally i do my best to

3170.72 --> 3176.9599999999996
to contribute to that

3173.04 --> 3176.96
to actually well bring

3178.48 --> 3183.359
the cosmogeny

3180.88 --> 3187.44
struggle back in it

3183.359 --> 3187.44
to yeah the ball win

3187.68 --> 3193.44
right but then when i as baldwin if i

3191.04 --> 3195.68
certainly don't have the basically if

3193.44 --> 3198.0
i'm not allowed to do that anymore yeah

3195.68 --> 3198.0
then

3198.16 --> 3204.64
to me that's a sign like okay now it is

3201.119 --> 3207.119
really an echo chamber

3204.64 --> 3209.5989999999997
if i can't even bring in like ball

3207.119 --> 3213.52
related realizations

3209.599 --> 3216.0
while perfectly covering my tracks

3213.52 --> 3218.52
or not covering like

3216.0 --> 3220.16
making the right steps clearing up the

3218.52 --> 3222.96
presuppositions

3220.16 --> 3224.8799999999997
right in order to not

3222.96 --> 3226.16
potentially make a

3224.88 --> 3228.1600000000003
official

3226.16 --> 3230.0789999999997
claim about something

3228.16 --> 3232.3999999999996
right but if i'm not even allowed to do

3230.079 --> 3233.119
that yeah then that that's worrisome to

3232.4 --> 3235.2000000000003
me

3233.119 --> 3238.6400000000003
because that to me would mean like wow

3235.2 --> 3240.48
this is really an echo chamber now

3238.64 --> 3243.2
but

3240.48 --> 3244.16
i think nathan recognizes that too and

3243.2 --> 3245.7599999999998
again

3244.16 --> 3247.359
in the after show

3245.76 --> 3249.44
the first thing he did when it came back

3247.359 --> 3253.119
in and i got in pretty much as the after

3249.44 --> 3255.52
show started up he apologized and laid

3253.119 --> 3255.52
it out

3255.76 --> 3261.96
not just a quick sorry right so he gets

3258.96 --> 3261.96
that

3275.52 --> 3279.559
should embrace more newbies

3280.72 --> 3284.9599999999996
i don't know gadget inspector i don't

3283.2 --> 3286.24
know if he should embrace more newbies i

3284.96 --> 3288.799
mean

3286.24 --> 3290.0
us guys in the panel we really are

3288.799 --> 3291.68
trying to

3290.0 --> 3294.16
develop

3291.68 --> 3297.1189999999997
high tier

3294.16 --> 3300.48
if you get too many newbies dragged in

3297.119 --> 3300.48
then you'll just end up

3301.68 --> 3305.04
basically

3302.799 --> 3309.119
yeah

3305.04 --> 3309.119
get misunderstandings out of the way and

3310.64 --> 3313.7599999999998
and if you're yeah if you have a lot and

3312.48 --> 3316.079
if you're surrounded by newbies and

3313.76 --> 3318.88
you're going to lay down some peak

3316.079 --> 3320.4
development some peak technical insight

3318.88 --> 3321.359
a lot of them are just not going to get

3320.4 --> 3323.52
it

3321.359 --> 3325.5989999999997
they won't be able to respond with

3323.52 --> 3327.92
anything productive

3325.599 --> 3330.7200000000003
that would help you you see so i'm not

3327.92 --> 3333.119
sure about that i i kind of like the

3330.72 --> 3334.799
the wizard council set up that it is

3333.119 --> 3338.839
right now

3334.799 --> 3338.839
people that are really

3340.81 --> 3343.909
[Music]

3348.68 --> 3351.73
[Music]

3369.119 --> 3373.319
all right pj crew shank yeah

3377.76 --> 3381.599
right high level physics very hard to

3379.76 --> 3383.76
understand for non-technical people yeah

3381.599 --> 3383.76
but

3388.16 --> 3392.5589999999997
well there's nothing

3390.88 --> 3394.7200000000003
we can really do about that the

3392.559 --> 3396.7200000000003
classical homeopath we are trying to

3394.72 --> 3399.4399999999996
work out the physics

3396.72 --> 3402.48
trying to get an oversight trying to

3399.44 --> 3406.2400000000002
basically map out the physical reality

3402.48 --> 3407.839
through physics and trying to evade

3406.24 --> 3410.64
machinations

3407.839 --> 3413.359
misconceptions

3410.64 --> 3415.68
and trying to bridge the gaps

3413.359 --> 3417.68
that are left so yeah that's going to be

3415.68 --> 3420.96
high level and yeah

3417.68 --> 3422.5589999999997
non-technical people will be like what

3420.96 --> 3426.2400000000002
that there's nothing we could do about

3422.559 --> 3426.2400000000002
that that's just the way it is

3427.2 --> 3430.8799999999997
i mean

3428.64 --> 3433.359
eventually when we like mastered the

3430.88 --> 3436.0
concepts then we find and i personally

3433.359 --> 3438.48
like doing that find ways to explain it

3436.0 --> 3440.319
to less technical people

3438.48 --> 3442.2400000000002
but in the middle of the development

3440.319 --> 3443.52
process yeah it's going to be all very

3442.24 --> 3445.4399999999996
technical

3443.52 --> 3448.24
because we're literally trying to work

3445.44 --> 3451.119
out the details you know

3448.24 --> 3453.4399999999996
and that's just very technical

3451.119 --> 3453.44
anyway

3463.92 --> 3469.64
yeah it's the wizard table not the

3465.52 --> 3469.64
kindergarten class that's right

3477.53 --> 3480.5890000000004
[Music]

3484.96 --> 3490.16
non-technical people eat ice cream and

3487.52 --> 3491.359
don't look into the realm they live

3490.16 --> 3494.799
so really

3491.359 --> 3494.799
they all eat ice cream today

3501.359 --> 3506.16
yeah yeah cps look buddy you've been

3504.16 --> 3508.24
hanging around for quite a while

3506.16 --> 3510.3999999999996
that's the type of comment that gets you

3508.24 --> 3513.2
banned even though you've been around

3510.4 --> 3513.2000000000003
for quite a while

3513.52 --> 3518.72
it's straight out [ __ ]

3516.72 --> 3520.8799999999997
caught on what

3518.72 --> 3523.1189999999997
lie

3520.88 --> 3524.1600000000003
what you didn't think i'd pick up on

3523.119 --> 3527.359
that

3524.16 --> 3531.3999999999996
like what what lie cbs

3527.359 --> 3531.4
how the [ __ ] dare you

3534.64 --> 3538.72
you better lay it down right now

3539.119 --> 3543.2000000000003
or you're gonna get a timeout

3541.28 --> 3544.96
potentially a ban

3543.2 --> 3548.3999999999996
opinion

3544.96 --> 3552.2400000000002
no no no no no that's not an opinion

3548.4 --> 3555.2000000000003
that's an accusation

3552.24 --> 3557.52
that's an accusation cbs

3555.2 --> 3560.0
telling

3557.52 --> 3562.799
telling everybody like he's getting

3560.0 --> 3567.359
caught on a lie that's not an opinion

3562.799 --> 3569.359
that's called an accusation

3567.359 --> 3570.839
now lay down the proof

3569.359 --> 3575.16
for that

3570.839 --> 3575.16
accusation cbs

3590.799 --> 3594.88
yeah slander is one word for it that's

3592.64 --> 3594.8799999999997
right

3599.28 --> 3604.079
so yeah either explain that justify that

3602.16 --> 3606.5589999999997
the accusation or delete your message

3604.079 --> 3609.28
maybe you want to rewrite that rephrase

3606.559 --> 3609.28
that slightly

3610.64 --> 3616.8799999999997
right so that it is more about opinion

3613.119 --> 3616.88
instead of an accusation

3620.64 --> 3625.359
do i remember that discord chat with

3623.52 --> 3626.4
riley

3625.359 --> 3630.7599999999998
what

3626.4 --> 3630.76
what discord chat with riley

3671.76 --> 3677.599
okay harry's 106. say

3674.64 --> 3677.5989999999997
it's a little silly

3680.559 --> 3684.52
not to share the info

3684.72 --> 3689.5589999999997
okay i'm still not seeing it

3699.76 --> 3702.079
oh

3702.16 --> 3706.319
because it was a perfect globe

3704.0 --> 3709.839
so are you talking about something that

3706.319 --> 3714.64
happened like three years ago

3709.839 --> 3714.64
when we were still kind of

3714.72 --> 3719.2
trying to find our way in the dark we

3716.64 --> 3721.2799999999997
hadn't realized

3719.2 --> 3723.839
the the yeah the

3721.28 --> 3727.119
foundational arguments yet because yeah

3723.839 --> 3729.44
that did kind of happen we were worried

3727.119 --> 3732.6400000000003
we all thought as flat earthers that we

3729.44 --> 3735.039
were kind of in an equal fight

3732.64 --> 3736.96
all right so yeah we did have moments

3735.039 --> 3738.079
like don't don't talk about don't say

3736.96 --> 3741.44
that

3738.079 --> 3743.28
because they might use it yeah yeah yeah

3741.44 --> 3745.68
so did i

3743.28 --> 3748.799
so did almost everybody because we

3745.68 --> 3752.5589999999997
didn't understand yet that we had one

3748.799 --> 3754.72
we still were in the com misconception

3752.559 --> 3756.0
that the ball might

3754.72 --> 3758.319
win

3756.0 --> 3760.319
right it's different

3758.319 --> 3761.92
a couple of years ago that's right yeah

3760.319 --> 3763.2
everything was different a couple of

3761.92 --> 3764.48
years ago

3763.2 --> 3766.16
cbs

3764.48 --> 3768.319
i can't believe

3766.16 --> 3771.1189999999997
that the entire different scenario you

3768.319 --> 3774.079
would like lay that down as proof that

3771.119 --> 3774.079
nathan lies

3774.88 --> 3778.1600000000003
how is that even a lie

3778.559 --> 3782.4
telling somebody hey don't

3780.799 --> 3784.559
don't talk about that

3782.4 --> 3785.92
don't throw it out there keep it a

3784.559 --> 3789.28
secret

3785.92 --> 3791.839
how is that a lie c do you know what a

3789.28 --> 3797.3190000000004
lie is cps

3791.839 --> 3797.319
do you know it do you know what a lie is

3811.359 --> 3815.839
yeah get the [ __ ] out

3813.359 --> 3815.839
[ __ ] off

3815.92 --> 3820.799
go be triggered somewhere else dude

3819.039 --> 3822.88
take another booster shot while you're

3820.799 --> 3825.7599999999998
at it

3822.88 --> 3828.1600000000003
jesus

3825.76 --> 3831.96
ancestral winds are gonna come for you

3828.16 --> 3831.96
sooner or later dude

3845.839 --> 3848.839
uh

3853.359 --> 3857.5989999999997
yeah wow cps dude

3856.079 --> 3858.48
he's a baller

3857.599 --> 3861.52
he's

3858.48 --> 3863.76
freaking pro vax idiot

3861.52 --> 3865.92
and he does get like this just like

3863.76 --> 3867.3590000000004
everybody else right it is the time of

3865.92 --> 3868.4
the year

3867.359 --> 3871.2799999999997
yeah

3868.4 --> 3873.76
just because everybody gets like that is

3871.28 --> 3875.52
not an excuse to just

3873.76 --> 3877.6800000000003
openly behave

3875.52 --> 3880.72
like that in my chat you're going to be

3877.68 --> 3882.64
subjected to my rules for the chat and

3880.72 --> 3884.16
that eventually is going to lead to you

3882.64 --> 3887.72
getting banned

3884.16 --> 3887.72
if you don't stop

3898.48 --> 3904.559
why did you get because he's a pro

3900.72 --> 3904.5589999999997
vaxxer rick montgomery

3905.44 --> 3911.76
he's taken the shots and he's like

3908.72 --> 3914.48
bragging about it

3911.76 --> 3914.48
that's why

3921.28 --> 3926.0
i hope that clears things up mon greg

3923.44 --> 3927.599
montgomery like i wouldn't tell anybody

3926.0 --> 3929.52
to do that

3927.599 --> 3931.52
were it not that they were like oh yeah

3929.52 --> 3932.64
i took the shot oh there's nothing wrong

3931.52 --> 3935.0389999999998
with me

3932.64 --> 3939.44
and i'm gonna take the next one i can't

3935.039 --> 3943.3590000000004
wait he literally was talking in my chat

3939.44 --> 3948.0
like in april that he couldn't wait to

3943.359 --> 3948.0
finally get the next shot okay

3955.039 --> 3958.2400000000002
what's wrong with that

3962.16 --> 3965.16
oh

3971.599 --> 3975.2400000000002
oh my god

3982.319 --> 3987.359
how is that relevant to effie

3984.72 --> 3989.68
well if we want to figure out the nature

3987.359 --> 3992.0
of the world you have to freaking

3989.68 --> 3994.24
survive

3992.0 --> 3998.079
and you still have to

3994.24 --> 3998.0789999999997
keep your faculties in order

3998.4 --> 4001.44
so yeah

4003.2 --> 4008.5589999999997
your immune system is not good well

4005.839 --> 4010.799
guess what rick montgomery

4008.559 --> 4013.119
taking the shots

4010.799 --> 4015.0389999999998
doesn't help your immune system if it's

4013.119 --> 4016.88
already weakened and you take that [ __ ]

4015.039 --> 4019.2000000000003
do you have any idea what you're doing

4016.88 --> 4021.52
to yourself

4019.2 --> 4023.839
doesn't seem like it

4021.52 --> 4023.839
dude

4025.76 --> 4028.2400000000002
this

4027.2 --> 4029.52
freaking

4028.24 --> 4034.64
v

4029.52 --> 4036.96
the c situat it's a calling operation

4034.64 --> 4038.0789999999997
i can't believe you don't realize that

4036.96 --> 4040.64
yet

4038.079 --> 4043.44
like hanging around here and you don't

4040.64 --> 4047.24
realize that

4043.44 --> 4047.2400000000002
what the [ __ ] dude

4063.52 --> 4068.64
by michael well okay in that case i

4066.24 --> 4070.3999999999996
don't give a [ __ ] dude you're going to

4068.64 --> 4073.359
die

4070.4 --> 4075.2000000000003
everybody that took the shot is going to

4073.359 --> 4076.96
die

4075.2 --> 4079.52
idiot

4076.96 --> 4081.839
have you ever looked

4079.52 --> 4084.96
into like the patents

4081.839 --> 4084.96
what is in there

4085.52 --> 4093.2
have you ever listened to the people

4088.079 --> 4095.44
that helped design the [ __ ] things

4093.2 --> 4097.679
that have rolled out warnings like this

4095.44 --> 4098.56
is all wrong

4097.679 --> 4101.1990000000005
the v

4098.56 --> 4104.719
all wrong it doesn't actually help it

4101.199 --> 4107.839
destroys your immune system

4104.719 --> 4110.0
with scientific evidence backing field

4107.839 --> 4112.4
study backing for that

4110.0 --> 4114.239
also the guy that made for example the

4112.4 --> 4116.3189999999995
test right the test

4114.239 --> 4118.879999999999
he literally said like this is not

4116.319 --> 4121.1990000000005
designed to do that

4118.88 --> 4122.88
it doesn't work

4121.199 --> 4126.0
and then there's the

4122.88 --> 4128.4800000000005
outright admission

4126.0 --> 4131.12
even from freaking governments

4128.48 --> 4133.2789999999995
themselves like things like oh yeah the

4131.12 --> 4136.159
mask doesn't actually work but you gotta

4133.279 --> 4137.6
wear them you gotta wear them anyway

4136.159 --> 4142.0
right dude

4137.6 --> 4142.0
what [ __ ] world are you living in man

4145.44 --> 4149.12
yeah if we want to have a a great time

4147.92 --> 4151.279
all together

4149.12 --> 4154.159
on this flat earth and figure out like

4151.279 --> 4157.120000000001
hey what is this realm actually

4154.159 --> 4159.199
is there this ice barrier are we a pond

4157.12 --> 4160.799
or is it something different right i

4159.199 --> 4163.759
talk about this a lot

4160.799 --> 4166.239
yeah well you gotta have enough people

4163.759 --> 4169.04
surviving

4166.239 --> 4169.839
in order to achieve something there

4169.04 --> 4172.239
right

4169.839 --> 4176.0
everybody if like every country breaks

4172.239 --> 4178.0
down because people are dying everywhere

4176.0 --> 4181.839
and losing their jobs because they're

4178.0 --> 4184.48
mandated to take a suicide shot

4181.839 --> 4186.48
and then society breaks down and then

4184.48 --> 4188.799
people that are already kind of pissed

4186.48 --> 4190.239
off looking for an excuse to

4188.799 --> 4192.159
look up a fight

4190.239 --> 4194.959999999999
and trash stuff they're gonna trash

4192.159 --> 4197.36
every how is a world that's completely

4194.96 --> 4199.44
trashed gonna come together to figure

4197.36 --> 4201.759999999999
out this realm

4199.44 --> 4204.239
yeah

4201.76 --> 4205.679
you need order

4204.239 --> 4207.759999999999
you need

4205.679 --> 4210.08
certain levels of prosperity

4207.76 --> 4212.320000000001
functionality in order to achieve

4210.08 --> 4215.36
anything like that in a world that is

4212.32 --> 4217.28
completely in chaos

4215.36 --> 4219.199
where you're just too busy trying to

4217.28 --> 4222.159
survive not getting

4219.199 --> 4224.239
pillaged by a looting gang

4222.159 --> 4226.879999999999
in your neighborhood yeah you're not

4224.239 --> 4230.239
gonna have time to explore and figure

4226.88 --> 4234.6
out the realm if you know what i mean

4230.239 --> 4234.599999999999
don't take the shot

4246.88 --> 4252.64
it was clinically approved yeah yeah you

4249.199 --> 4255.5199999999995
know what is also clinically approved

4252.64 --> 4258.8
fatal intubation of people perceived to

4255.52 --> 4261.120000000001
have covet condition and then they put

4258.8 --> 4264.159000000001
them on ram deserver to put them in an

4261.12 --> 4265.28
artificial coma then force a breathing

4264.159 --> 4266.96
machine

4265.28 --> 4270.84
into them

4266.96 --> 4274.4800000000005
which is statistically

4270.84 --> 4276.4800000000005
almost more than half the times fatal

4274.48 --> 4278.32
statistically

4276.48 --> 4281.839999999999
yeah

4278.32 --> 4284.239
in response to a minor condition

4281.84 --> 4285.360000000001
that you don't that you rarely actually

4284.239 --> 4288.239
die of

4285.36 --> 4290.839999999999
and that you can treat very differently

4288.239 --> 4294.5599999999995
without procedures that are

4290.84 --> 4297.360000000001
statistically known to become fatal

4294.56 --> 4298.84
more than half the times yeah you think

4297.36 --> 4301.04
that

4298.84 --> 4303.360000000001
oh but

4301.04 --> 4304.96
it's like but but they told me it was

4303.36 --> 4307.199
good

4304.96 --> 4308.4
you say

4307.199 --> 4313.159
wow

4308.4 --> 4313.159
they told you it was good that day

4316.4 --> 4320.4
who stands to gain

4318.32 --> 4321.88
by killing 80 percent of country's

4320.4 --> 4325.12
population

4321.88 --> 4329.36
eugenicist crazy people

4325.12 --> 4331.36
that literally want to make everybody

4329.36 --> 4334.5599999999995
die

4331.36 --> 4336.48
and then rule over the rubble

4334.56 --> 4338.8
by their own freaking admission and

4336.48 --> 4341.599999999999
plans drew drawn out

4338.8 --> 4343.4400000000005
decades and decades ago with their

4341.6 --> 4345.76
signatures

4343.44 --> 4347.759999999999
and today

4345.76 --> 4350.96
and like in the last 10 years

4347.76 --> 4352.4800000000005
they [ __ ] brag about it

4350.96 --> 4354.8
on camera

4352.48 --> 4354.799999999999
yeah

4355.04 --> 4358.8
so

4356.8 --> 4360.56
i don't know what rock you've lived

4358.8 --> 4362.719
under

4360.56 --> 4362.719
but

4362.8 --> 4367.4800000000005
this world is not what you think it is

4370.48 --> 4376.0
yeah you a lot are [ __ ] either way

4372.64 --> 4378.320000000001
well guess who's [ __ ] first

4376.0 --> 4379.679
guess who's gonna die in five years very

4378.32 --> 4381.44
likely

4379.679 --> 4383.12
yeah

4381.44 --> 4385.599999999999
yeah we're [ __ ] because we're gonna

4383.12 --> 4387.84
have to deal with the backlash and the

4385.6 --> 4390.4800000000005
trash left behind

4387.84 --> 4390.4800000000005
that's right

4390.64 --> 4395.52
well i'm not gonna take

4392.4 --> 4398.5599999999995
like the suicide way out and just oh oh

4395.52 --> 4400.719
well i'm gonna just take it anyway

4398.56 --> 4402.64
and then die and leave the mess for

4400.719 --> 4404.88
everybody else to clean up how about

4402.64 --> 4404.88
that

4406.0 --> 4410.4
good luck to me there yeah i know

4408.239 --> 4413.04
yeah i'm not gonna be oh oh the world's

4410.4 --> 4414.799999999999
gonna [ __ ] oh it's time to kill myself i

4413.04 --> 4417.5199999999995
don't want to deal with it

4414.8 --> 4420.88
yeah yeah no because i'm not a [ __ ]

4417.52 --> 4422.8
coward i actually care for this world i

4420.88 --> 4425.679
actually care enough

4422.8 --> 4428.8
to take that burden

4425.679 --> 4432.0
at least mentally

4428.8 --> 4434.88
and try to use my intellect to kind of

4432.0 --> 4437.36
find a dynamic way through

4434.88 --> 4439.76
so that we can actually survive all this

4437.36 --> 4441.679
not that i have that much power or

4439.76 --> 4442.4800000000005
influence even

4441.679 --> 4444.719
but

4442.48 --> 4446.239
maybe

4444.719 --> 4448.4
people will just pick up on that

4446.239 --> 4450.5599999999995
frequency as well and and i could help

4448.4 --> 4455.08
that way i don't know i'm trying i'm

4450.56 --> 4455.080000000001
just trying to do what i can

4455.76 --> 4460.719
why five years is there a timer yeah

4458.159 --> 4462.799999999999
well why don't you look into the medical

4460.719 --> 4464.56
research about it

4462.8 --> 4465.6
you didn't do that did you

4464.56 --> 4469.320000000001
because

4465.6 --> 4469.320000000001
you got the approval

4482.32 --> 4485.199
you did actually

4485.36 --> 4490.08
oh really

4486.88 --> 4490.08
and what was the source

4491.04 --> 4494.76
was your source pubmed

4498.64 --> 4507.84
vaccines polio oh so oh you did

4503.4 --> 4507.839999999999
background research ooh

4507.92 --> 4512.159
yeah so

4509.199 --> 4516.08
you don't realize that these v's aren't

4512.159 --> 4518.32
actually vs and that only recently

4516.08 --> 4520.8
only recently

4518.32 --> 4523.44
the freaking dictionary oxford

4520.8 --> 4525.1990000000005
dictionary actually changed the meaning

4523.44 --> 4527.839999999999
of the word

4525.199 --> 4528.96
in order to now suddenly include gene

4527.84 --> 4531.84
therapy

4528.96 --> 4532.88
which was definitely not categorized as

4531.84 --> 4535.52
a v

4532.88 --> 4535.52
before

4535.679 --> 4539.4
so did you know that

4546.719 --> 4551.76
so very anti-free what anti-freedom to

4549.679 --> 4553.6
commit suicide are you [ __ ] out of

4551.76 --> 4556.08
your mind

4553.6 --> 4558.2390000000005
i don't want the world to collapse

4556.08 --> 4559.199
i want everybody to wake up so they

4558.239 --> 4562.718999999999
don't

4559.199 --> 4567.28
walk into the open trap

4562.719 --> 4568.88
designed to exterminate you

4567.28 --> 4572.639999999999
i'm sorry

4568.88 --> 4575.84
i'm sorry i'm getting involved

4572.64 --> 4578.159000000001
what you just want to comfortably walk

4575.84 --> 4580.88
into the slaughterhouse well i

4578.159 --> 4583.44
i don't like

4580.88 --> 4586.4800000000005
feeling good about myself how i'm

4583.44 --> 4588.879999999999
allowing people the freedom to just

4586.48 --> 4591.199
comfortably kill themselves

4588.88 --> 4593.52
no i don't like standing by and seeing

4591.199 --> 4596.0
that happen

4593.52 --> 4597.4400000000005
i'm sorry i don't like that

4596.0 --> 4601.44
i don't think that's freedom i think

4597.44 --> 4601.44
that's just straight out cowardice

4605.679 --> 4609.04
there's easier way to kill people off

4608.159 --> 4612.639999999999
yeah

4609.04 --> 4614.56
yeah but those easier ways

4612.64 --> 4618.4800000000005
the more overt ways

4614.56 --> 4620.0
are very high in backlash you see they

4618.48 --> 4622.48
lose control

4620.0 --> 4625.12
now instead of just like

4622.48 --> 4627.678999999999
chopping heads off and [ __ ] or just

4625.12 --> 4631.12
arresting people executing them right

4627.679 --> 4633.12
that would wake the [ __ ] up

4631.12 --> 4635.28
and it wouldn't work anymore now they're

4633.12 --> 4636.4
just like

4635.28 --> 4637.759999999999
oh just

4636.4 --> 4640.239
calm down

4637.76 --> 4643.12
don't listen to the conspiracy theories

4640.239 --> 4644.32
this is all proved it is okay just go

4643.12 --> 4647.5199999999995
along and

4644.32 --> 4648.88
we'll work it out we'll take care of the

4647.52 --> 4652.4800000000005
evil bug

4648.88 --> 4653.679
we'll figure it out just trust us

4652.48 --> 4655.12
it's okay

4653.679 --> 4657.12
it's okay oh

4655.12 --> 4658.8
oh you know people that died um yeah but

4657.12 --> 4660.64
it can happen you know and

4658.8 --> 4663.360000000001
it's probably the bug

4660.64 --> 4664.64
oh they they took the shot it can happen

4663.36 --> 4666.96
it's okay

4664.64 --> 4670.08
you know don't worry about it

4666.96 --> 4671.84
like just go along we'll take care of it

4670.08 --> 4674.5599999999995
that's what's happening right now right

4671.84 --> 4677.6
this is not overt

4674.56 --> 4679.679
genocide slaughter

4677.6 --> 4682.320000000001
because that would

4679.679 --> 4687.679
snap people out of it no no they're

4682.32 --> 4687.679
shushing everybody into a slow death

4690.8 --> 4694.88
okay that's what's going on

4692.719 --> 4697.4800000000005
overt ways

4694.88 --> 4700.2390000000005
break the whole control spell they're

4697.48 --> 4702.718999999999
hypnotizing everybody

4700.239 --> 4705.759999999999
making them walk into their death

4702.719 --> 4707.679
if they would not do that but instead

4705.76 --> 4710.719
just start killing

4707.679 --> 4712.88
people would absolutely revolt even the

4710.719 --> 4714.96
really stupid ones

4712.88 --> 4717.04
that like to be mind controlled they

4714.96 --> 4720.719
would revolt you see

4717.04 --> 4722.96
but since there is no overt

4720.719 --> 4725.92
slaughter going on and there's excuses

4722.96 --> 4729.04
being made for why people die

4725.92 --> 4730.88
switcheroo games gaslighting

4729.04 --> 4733.44
then they don't revolt they can just

4730.88 --> 4736.159000000001
comfortably keep on walking down that

4733.44 --> 4738.08
aisle into the slaughterhouse without

4736.159 --> 4740.48
feeling restless right they just

4738.08 --> 4742.719
comfortably walk to their deaths

4740.48 --> 4745.04
if you just start killing people overtly

4742.719 --> 4746.96
yeah people are gonna revolt and they're

4745.04 --> 4748.48
gonna snap out of this control spell so

4746.96 --> 4750.56
they don't want to do that don't you get

4748.48 --> 4750.5599999999995
it

4760.32 --> 4764.159
yeah my body my choice yeah that's right

4762.64 --> 4766.0
go ahead

4764.159 --> 4767.44
if you want to do that [ __ ] to yourself

4766.0 --> 4770.88
go ahead

4767.44 --> 4773.199
i'm not gonna stand by and pretend like

4770.88 --> 4776.0
it's all right

4773.199 --> 4778.639999999999
i'm gonna tell you exactly the [ __ ] that

4776.0 --> 4778.64
you're into

4782.88 --> 4785.1990000000005
wow

4785.6 --> 4790.96
yeah well you see i can still get

4788.8 --> 4792.719
offspring

4790.96 --> 4796.2390000000005
because i didn't

4792.719 --> 4798.88
poison myself

4796.239 --> 4800.239
to the level where i can no longer

4798.88 --> 4801.52
procreate

4800.239 --> 4802.32
yeah

4801.52 --> 4804.56
so

4802.32 --> 4806.159
there's anybody left out there

4804.56 --> 4808.080000000001
it's going to be wise enough not to take

4806.159 --> 4809.759999999999
any of these shots

4808.08 --> 4812.5599999999995
then i might still have a chance in the

4809.76 --> 4814.400000000001
future you see i'm i'm still very vital

4812.56 --> 4816.719
for my age

4814.4 --> 4818.5599999999995
and yeah

4816.719 --> 4821.6
it's not too late

4818.56 --> 4823.92
now for people that take these shots

4821.6 --> 4826.320000000001
if you ever even survive that long

4823.92 --> 4827.84
enough you're gonna find out if you're

4826.32 --> 4830.08
gonna try to have kids you're gonna have

4827.84 --> 4833.8
problems

4830.08 --> 4833.8
i know you will

4834.08 --> 4837.719
so good luck

4846.159 --> 4851.28
oh okay macgyver institute for nina

4848.0 --> 4855.56
techno sorry i just

4851.28 --> 4855.5599999999995
i thought it was a gamma pylon

4861.76 --> 4865.0
get contained

4874.08 --> 4878.5599999999995
lose at least like half global yeah

4876.08 --> 4880.32
probably yeah

4878.56 --> 4883.360000000001
like i can say it

4880.32 --> 4886.5599999999995
i can say it with great certainty now

4883.36 --> 4889.12
like unbelievable but it's going to be

4886.56 --> 4891.280000000001
the biggest genocide

4889.12 --> 4893.599999999999
the world has ever seen

4891.28 --> 4896.0
that's gonna happen it's you can't it

4893.6 --> 4899.280000000001
cannot be prevented any longer

4896.0 --> 4900.8
we can just try to prevent

4899.28 --> 4903.84
all of it

4900.8 --> 4906.719
from dying that's it that's the best we

4903.84 --> 4910.159000000001
could do it's already going to be

4906.719 --> 4911.12
the biggest genocide the world has ever

4910.159 --> 4912.799999999999
seen

4911.12 --> 4915.36
in history

4912.8 --> 4915.360000000001
by far

4915.6 --> 4917.92
right

4916.4 --> 4920.48
and yeah just because you don't have

4917.92 --> 4923.12
like endless footage of like soldiers

4920.48 --> 4926.0
executing civilians like for example

4923.12 --> 4927.199
what happened in china

4926.0 --> 4929.92
yeah

4927.199 --> 4931.759999999999
it's the number the shared number of

4929.92 --> 4933.92
deaths that are resulting from this

4931.76 --> 4936.320000000001
project it's gonna

4933.92 --> 4939.36
stand alone it's it's probably gonna be

4936.32 --> 4942.4
the biggest genocide in human history

4939.36 --> 4945.12
ever until the end of times okay because

4942.4 --> 4947.679
there's a likelihood that after this

4945.12 --> 4950.88
humanity won't even be able to have that

4947.679 --> 4952.4800000000005
many people around because of it because

4950.88 --> 4955.92
of the other effects because of the

4952.48 --> 4957.199
sterilizing the genetic malformation

4955.92 --> 4959.84
that it does

4957.199 --> 4961.759999999999
right there's a big chance that after

4959.84 --> 4964.88
this

4961.76 --> 4966.8
the the evil crazy eugenicists

4964.88 --> 4968.400000000001
or like satanists that just want to get

4966.8 --> 4970.159000000001
as many people killed as possible they

4968.4 --> 4973.36
don't even have some kind of managing

4970.159 --> 4975.839999999999
reasons they won't be able to trump this

4973.36 --> 4978.88
ever again because there simply will not

4975.84 --> 4981.1990000000005
be able to be enough people

4978.88 --> 4983.84
to that level again to achieve anything

4981.199 --> 4987.28
like this it's going to be the biggest

4983.84 --> 4989.679
genocide in the world's history

4987.28 --> 4992.48
until the end of earth

4989.679 --> 4992.4800000000005
you understand

4995.6 --> 5000.320000000001
can't tell

4996.719 --> 5003.28
sir yeah i am serious i am very [ __ ]

5000.32 --> 5003.28
serious right now

5007.04 --> 5014.0
yeah wow all right

5009.52 --> 5016.2390000000005
now you can wow all up all to the grave

5014.0 --> 5018.159
you can never be wowed about like wow

5016.239 --> 5019.44
this actually happened wow

5018.159 --> 5021.199
yeah

5019.44 --> 5022.719
we all died

5021.199 --> 5024.638999999999
can't believe this actually happened

5022.719 --> 5027.04
yeah yeah you're all dead

5024.639 --> 5028.8
yeah it happened it's gonna happen

5027.04 --> 5030.239
you're not dead right now you're gonna

5028.8 --> 5032.2390000000005
die

5030.239 --> 5035.12
it happened it's gonna happen it's gonna

5032.239 --> 5037.599999999999
be the biggest genocide in the world's

5035.12 --> 5040.92
history for all time

5037.6 --> 5040.92
that's right

5045.12 --> 5049.76
and it's already happened it's not

5046.639 --> 5052.08
something that's going to happen

5049.76 --> 5054.96
like it could happen we could stop it no

5052.08 --> 5056.719
it's already going to happen

5054.96 --> 5058.639
all right

5056.719 --> 5061.12
there's no more stopping that from

5058.639 --> 5062.32
happening it's going to happen

5061.12 --> 5064.719
any proof

5062.32 --> 5066.0
well why don't you come back at me in

5064.719 --> 5069.679

if you can't handle me saying that

5105.44 --> 5109.759999999999
just get the [ __ ] out

5107.76 --> 5112.1990000000005
i'm calling it right now and i don't

5112.199 --> 5117.28
inacceptance

5114.0 --> 5119.84
skepticism or scored responses why don't

5117.28 --> 5123.36

i called it for what it is and you're

5139.04 --> 5141.84
gonna see

5152.96 --> 5159.6
i'm not here for some reason oh well

5156.0 --> 5161.36
what if that you knew the reason

5159.6 --> 5163.4400000000005
how do you know that reason's gonna be

5161.36 --> 5165.12
laughable

5163.44 --> 5166.638999999999
maybe it's gonna be a terrible reason

5165.12 --> 5169.84
why i'm not here

5166.639 --> 5169.84
you're still gonna laugh then

5170.0 --> 5174.08
or maybe you're just gonna be freaked

5171.92 --> 5176.32
out because i actually called it

5174.08 --> 5179.92
straight out unapologetic not trying to

5176.32 --> 5183.12
be careful just straight out saying it

5179.92 --> 5186.88
and not even the only one dude

5183.12 --> 5188.5599999999995
there's literal doc like life doctors

5186.88 --> 5191.28
people that have been doctors their

5188.56 --> 5192.639
entire life that have been attacked by

5191.28 --> 5194.719
establishment

5192.639 --> 5197.36
for their alternative practices even

5194.719 --> 5198.4
though they've had massive results

5197.36 --> 5200.239
they

5198.4 --> 5203.28
say it yeah

5200.239 --> 5206.4
i'm not making this [ __ ] up

5203.28 --> 5208.96
i am not making it up

5206.4 --> 5211.839999999999
i'm simply relaying the horrifying

5208.96 --> 5211.84
message

5213.44 --> 5219.678999999999
thank you america silver patriot

5216.0 --> 5219.679
for the five dollar super chat donation

5220.8 --> 5224.400000000001
yeah the internet is poison people's

5222.32 --> 5226.4
mind but people people poison their own

5224.4 --> 5228.5599999999995
minds

5226.4 --> 5229.5199999999995
and doctors can be stupid too yeah i

5228.56 --> 5231.84
know

5229.52 --> 5234.96
that's why i make it my business to

5231.84 --> 5237.1990000000005
distinguish which doctors are actually

5234.96 --> 5239.92
good and which one are full of [ __ ] just

5237.199 --> 5241.599999999999
following some stupid corporate line

5239.92 --> 5243.76
yeah

5241.6 --> 5246.0
it's called distinguishing

5243.76 --> 5249.1990000000005
characteristics

5246.0 --> 5251.36
that's my freaking expertise that's my

5249.199 --> 5255.199
personal life

5251.36 --> 5258.08
expertise as a hobbyist layman

5255.199 --> 5259.199
psychologist

5258.08 --> 5261.76
yeah

5259.199 --> 5267.159
that's what i do

5261.76 --> 5267.159000000001
that's how i refine my information

5271.6 --> 5276.56
you say one thing and then demonstrate

5273.28 --> 5276.5599999999995
what what are you talking about

5278.8 --> 5282.320000000001
i say one thing and then demonstrate

5280.88 --> 5284.0
another

5282.32 --> 5286.32
you can you

5284.0 --> 5287.679
care you say you care about people not

5286.32 --> 5288.88
getting

5287.679 --> 5291.4400000000005
the v

5288.88 --> 5293.679
and then you tell people to f off and

5291.44 --> 5296.08
get the v

5293.679 --> 5298.0
yeah i say that out of frustration

5296.08 --> 5300.08
because i think that they will you know

5298.0 --> 5302.239
because if people don't snap out of it

5300.08 --> 5305.199
when i first confront them with this

5302.239 --> 5306.879999999999
it's actually likely that they do go and

5305.199 --> 5309.919999999999
run to take the v

5306.88 --> 5312.56
as their religious death cult sacrament

5309.92 --> 5314.88
to forget about it again to say no i

5312.56 --> 5317.84
trust the system i'm gonna do it i

5314.88 --> 5319.28
stress the system like yeah i know i

5317.84 --> 5321.6
gave it to my kid

5319.28 --> 5324.08
and he like got all bell's palsy or

5321.6 --> 5325.76
something terrible i'm gonna give it to

5324.08 --> 5327.5199999999995
my other kids too

5325.76 --> 5330.56
yeah that that's what i'm talking about

5327.52 --> 5333.040000000001
that's why i say that

5330.56 --> 5334.96
right because if you're already in that

5333.04 --> 5336.48
cult mindset

5334.96 --> 5338.719
then you're gone

5336.48 --> 5340.879999999999
there's nothing i can do for you

5338.719 --> 5343.12
then i give up on you and then i'm gonna

5340.88 --> 5344.96
say something like that

5343.12 --> 5346.5599999999995
because it's like yeah well if you're

5344.96 --> 5351.84
gonna go

5346.56 --> 5351.84
into that then maybe just do it quickly

5351.92 --> 5354.159
right

5355.28 --> 5360.719
so you can't linger around and let your

5358.48 --> 5361.678999999999
stupid cultishness rub off on other

5360.719 --> 5365.56
people

5361.679 --> 5365.56
that's why i say that

5380.48 --> 5384.48
there's plenty yeah but you can't name

5382.239 --> 5386.638999999999
any what are you gonna say just google

5384.48 --> 5386.638999999999
it

5386.96 --> 5392.719
you don't watch tv anymore

5389.92 --> 5396.0
twice as bad oh really so where did you

5392.719 --> 5396.0

5406.159 --> 5409.92
name the website

5408.48 --> 5411.599999999999

5409.92 --> 5413.36
did you forget

5411.6 --> 5415.52
you didn't really look anything up did

5413.36 --> 5417.44
you you just

5415.52 --> 5419.76
met a couple of doctors they seemed

5417.44 --> 5421.839999999999
really smart and energetic and you just

5419.76 --> 5424.159000000001
trusted them didn't you

5421.84 --> 5425.679
that's what really happened

5424.159 --> 5427.759999999999
same place so you look up your

5425.679 --> 5429.12
information oh really what website is

soup to you

5442.08 --> 5446.48
you don't realize that

5444.0 --> 5448.8
one source isn't the same as another

5446.48 --> 5451.5199999999995
source

5448.8 --> 5453.28
family of doctors yeah see i knew it

you were just bluffing you didn't

5453.28 --> 5457.92
research [ __ ]

5455.679 --> 5461.6
you haven't even looked anything up on

5457.92 --> 5463.04
the internet you're not naming a source

5461.6 --> 5464.96
i bet you

5463.04 --> 5465.84
this guy doesn't even know what pubmed

5464.96 --> 5467.12
is

5465.84 --> 5471.639
do you

5467.12 --> 5471.639
you don't even know what that is do you

5483.52 --> 5485.92
great

5486.32 --> 5490.719
see and that's very typical a lot of

5488.48 --> 5493.599999999999
people do that

5490.719 --> 5496.08
they went for it

5493.6 --> 5498.8
and then they just bluff no no it's all

5496.08 --> 5500.159
right like they bluff for

5498.8 --> 5501.679
their choice

5500.159 --> 5504.799999999999
because they didn't actually look

5501.679 --> 5507.84
anything up they're not even half way as

5504.8 --> 5509.52
informed as they should be before making

5507.84 --> 5512.400000000001
such a decision

5509.52 --> 5514.8
afterward they're not even that informed

5512.4 --> 5517.839999999999
right that's the problem

5514.8 --> 5520.8
he's just trying to cover for his own

5517.84 --> 5522.96
entry to the death cult

5520.8 --> 5525.12
that he refused to recognize for what it

5522.96 --> 5527.04
is

5525.12 --> 5530.239
that's what's going on because he didn't

5527.04 --> 5534.159
research anything he doesn't even know

5530.239 --> 5536.5599999999995
how to research anything on the internet

5534.159 --> 5539.199
he doesn't even know the proper sources

5536.56 --> 5541.120000000001
he doesn't even know what source sites

5539.199 --> 5543.28
are for this sort of thing you don't

5541.12 --> 5546.76
know [ __ ] dude

5543.28 --> 5546.759999999999
you're a numpty

5548.239 --> 5552.32
and you're a really bad bluffer you see

5551.04 --> 5554.159
bluff

5552.32 --> 5556.5599999999995
works pretty well with people that

5554.159 --> 5557.5199999999995
aren't informed about

5556.56 --> 5560.4800000000005
well

5557.52 --> 5561.76
the region of expertise the bluff is

5560.48 --> 5563.759999999999
sitting in

5561.76 --> 5566.159000000001
guess what

5563.76 --> 5568.08
you can't fool me buddy i know about

5566.159 --> 5570.879999999999
these things

5568.08 --> 5574.719
know about it very well and i studied

5570.88 --> 5578.400000000001
inside the psyche a lot you can't bluff

5574.719 --> 5578.4
me you don't know [ __ ]

5579.04 --> 5584.159
you don't even know where to look up

5581.04 --> 5584.159
medical information

5585.6 --> 5591.2390000000005
you're a numpty

5587.44 --> 5591.239
and you're a bad bluffer

5603.36 --> 5608.96

5836.56 --> 5840.400000000001
you don't do rick montgomery

5839.44 --> 5842.638999999999
you have

5840.4 --> 5843.839999999999
very little grip on

5842.639 --> 5846.2390000000005
medical

5843.84 --> 5848.4800000000005
things it seems

5846.239 --> 5851.44
like you don't even know

5848.48 --> 5853.678999999999
what was in that shot do you you have no

5851.44 --> 5856.48
idea what you're talking about to say

5853.679 --> 5857.92
such a thing oh let's just do it on that

5856.48 --> 5859.919999999999
on the food

5857.92 --> 5862.4800000000005
like do you even know what was in there

5859.92 --> 5866.159
i doubt it

5862.48 --> 5868.718999999999
like you see there's this thing about

5866.159 --> 5871.5199999999995
bypassing

5868.719 --> 5874.96
systems like bypassing the digestion

5871.52 --> 5878.0
system by putting it directly into you

5874.96 --> 5878.0
oh my god it's

5879.199 --> 5883.839999999999
yeah adamic i thought he was being

5880.96 --> 5883.84
sarcastic it's just

5892.48 --> 5896.799999999999
yeah i'm putting food yeah that dude we

5895.199 --> 5898.96
haven't in the slo-mo movie i haven't

5896.8 --> 5900.96
even addressed like all the nuremburg

5898.96 --> 5903.199
called violations

5900.96 --> 5904.56
like i'm i haven't even gotten that to

5903.199 --> 5906.5599999999995
that part yet

5904.56 --> 5911.080000000001
and i'm probably not going to since my

5906.56 --> 5911.080000000001
show is gonna like end in five minutes

5928.159 --> 5931.5199999999995
what the [ __ ]

5929.6 --> 5934.08
no golden wonder i have no prostate

5931.52 --> 5936.2390000000005
problem thanks for your concern though

5934.08 --> 5938.88
you know why i take trips to the toilet

5936.239 --> 5941.119
like once or twice every show

5938.88 --> 5944.0
because i drink a whole pot of tea

5941.119 --> 5944.0
during my show

5944.32 --> 5948.719
i mean if i wouldn't drink any tea i'd

5946.48 --> 5950.5599999999995
probably not go to the toilet but i do

5948.719 --> 5952.56
because i like drinking tea during the

5950.56 --> 5954.320000000001
show so i'm sorry

5952.56 --> 5957.52
i don't have a prostate problem i have

5954.32 --> 5959.759999999999
no problem in that region whatsoever

5957.52 --> 5961.360000000001
and i even take stuff

5959.76 --> 5963.1990000000005
to support

5961.36 --> 5965.679
my prostate health

5963.199 --> 5967.839999999999
saw palmetto

5965.679 --> 5970.639
so i have no problem but thanks for your

5967.84 --> 5970.639
concern though

5996.32 --> 6000.5599999999995
who cares for rules and violation of

5999.04 --> 6002.639
consent

6000.56 --> 6003.4400000000005
uh

6002.639 --> 6006.08
well

6003.44 --> 6009.678999999999
rick montgomery

6006.08 --> 6011.5199999999995
uh there is going to be a point where

6009.679 --> 6012.8
the ones that are unrolling this are

6011.52 --> 6014.8
going to

6012.8 --> 6016.88
basically be

6014.8 --> 6018.719
arrested and tried and then it does

6016.88 --> 6022.4400000000005
matter you see

6018.719 --> 6022.44
it matters a lot

6024.88 --> 6027.119
right

6027.84 --> 6033.6
because they're trying to kill us is not

6030.96 --> 6036.4800000000005
a judicial statement that doesn't mean

6033.6 --> 6039.1990000000005
anything you have to actually

6036.48 --> 6042.48
find the things that they violated

6039.199 --> 6043.5199999999995
legally in order to persecute them

6042.48 --> 6047.119
right

6043.52 --> 6051.6
so yeah consent is a really big part in

6047.119 --> 6054.639
that really really big

6051.6 --> 6055.84
it's actually the difference between

6054.639 --> 6059.1990000000005
getting a

6055.84 --> 6062.400000000001
reprimand or losing your medical license

6059.199 --> 6066.719
and the death penalty

6062.4 --> 6066.719
that's the difference it matters a lot

6071.679 --> 6076.84
right informed consent that's right they

6073.84 --> 6080.56
have to be in for you can't

6076.84 --> 6082.4800000000005
just lie about what you're doing

6080.56 --> 6083.92
and then like people like oh i'm okay

6082.48 --> 6086.48
with that and it's not actually what

6083.92 --> 6088.4
they're getting right that's also

6086.48 --> 6090.638999999999
not informed consent they have to know

6088.4 --> 6093.36
what it is they're engaging with exactly

6090.639 --> 6095.6
they can't be lied about

6093.36 --> 6096.639
they have to know

6095.6 --> 6099.360000000001
and that's

6096.639 --> 6100.719
that's the rules that's the nuremberg

6099.36 --> 6102.799999999999
code

6100.719 --> 6104.639
they did that because yeah this is not

6102.8 --> 6106.719
the first time anything

6104.639 --> 6109.76
like this is happen

6106.719 --> 6112.4
medical experimentation were

6109.76 --> 6115.119000000001
really bad

6112.4 --> 6115.119
in the uh

6116.159 --> 6119.5199999999995
yeah

6117.28 --> 6121.599999999999
during the nazi era they did that

6119.52 --> 6123.92
terribly

6121.6 --> 6125.6
on a much smaller scale by the way than

6123.92 --> 6127.679
what's happening right now

6125.6 --> 6130.2390000000005
and that's why the nuremberg code was

6127.679 --> 6132.2390000000005
devised in response to that so nothing

6130.239 --> 6134.879999999999
like that would happen again well guess

6132.239 --> 6137.28
what it happened again though but the

6134.88 --> 6139.52
code is still there to deal with it

6137.28 --> 6139.5199999999995
right

6141.199 --> 6145.919999999999
because of the code we can we don't have

6143.679 --> 6147.76
to devise the nuremberg code anymore

6145.92 --> 6149.36
like they had to back then because it

6147.76 --> 6150.96
was a new phenomenon now the code is

6149.36 --> 6152.639
just there

6150.96 --> 6154.4
you don't have to have like a whole

6152.639 --> 6156.88
bunch of

6154.4 --> 6159.679
judge intellectuals to figure out how to

6156.88 --> 6164.8
deal with it the code is already there

6159.679 --> 6164.8
to deal with this you see very important

6165.119 --> 6169.92
anyway i am rounding out this show it's

6166.8 --> 6171.92
getting really heated by the way but

6169.92 --> 6176.0
yeah dude i hope you

6171.92 --> 6178.2390000000005
actually learned something today

6176.0 --> 6178.239
but

6178.8 --> 6182.0
right

6179.679 --> 6182.0
anyway

6189.28 --> 6196.8
what shrunken heads of amazonians

6192.8 --> 6199.28
indians used as evidence against germans

6196.8 --> 6201.28
what

6199.28 --> 6202.96
what the [ __ ] are you talking about one

6201.28 --> 6205.84
for you i'd never heard of that that's

6202.96 --> 6205.84
weird

6209.36 --> 6214.239
well that threw me off anyway

6212.159 --> 6216.839999999999
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6214.239 --> 6220.718999999999
liked this show it was a little

6216.84 --> 6220.719
tense pretty harsh

6220.8 --> 6226.4800000000005
in ways but yeah it is

6223.199 --> 6229.839999999999
the truth everything i said is the truth

6226.48 --> 6233.678999999999
as i figured it out and yeah i am making

6229.84 --> 6236.400000000001
that prediction it's going to be

6233.679 --> 6238.32
the biggest human genocide in in the

6236.4 --> 6241.5199999999995
entirety of world history that will

6238.32 --> 6244.08
never be possible even to repeat that to

6241.52 --> 6245.4400000000005
that level those numbers

6244.08 --> 6248.8
that's what it's

6245.44 --> 6250.96
be that is what is happening and it

6248.8 --> 6252.0
the final stage hasn't even been entered

6250.96 --> 6253.36
yet

6252.0 --> 6256.08
right

6253.36 --> 6257.5199999999995
but these people are effectively all

6256.08 --> 6261.0
injected with

6257.52 --> 6261.0
timed bombs

6262.239 --> 6267.759999999999
and some of the bombs go off earlier

6264.159 --> 6270.08
than others but it's gonna go off

6267.76 --> 6272.96
this is like it's what it's designed for

6270.08 --> 6275.119
it's like that's oh my god you're not

6272.96 --> 6276.88
gonna do it all over again anyway
