101.159 --> 107.7
all right whether today

104.64 --> 111.92
is the

107.7 --> 111.92
very restless and moist

112.079 --> 116.69999999999999
it's like it's been

114.479 --> 118.92
raining a bit here and there but it's

116.7 --> 120.60000000000001
like yeah it's hanging in like I went

118.92 --> 123.06
out for groceries that's also part of

120.6 --> 125.52
the reason why I'm late

123.06 --> 128.58
it's just really moist out there

125.52 --> 130.97899999999998
even though it's not directly raining

128.58 --> 132.9
there's like puddles still hanging

130.979 --> 135.3
around everywhere

132.9 --> 137.04
and meanwhile up there there's no

135.3 --> 141.739
sunlight coming through this it's all

137.04 --> 141.739
clouded and it's rushing by rapidly

147.36 --> 150.37900000000002
so yeah

153.98 --> 158.599
it's just a bit Restless today

164.28 --> 168.72
right

166.26 --> 171.54
hello lhg

168.72 --> 172.85999999999999
first in chat Kevlar Jess Palmer Jeff

171.54 --> 175.879
gasshead

172.86 --> 175.87900000000002
good to see you

176.16 --> 183.42
it is Wednesday the 16th of February

180.42 --> 183.42
2022

187.92 --> 193.07999999999998
yeah and it's it's kind of restless so I

190.62 --> 196.28
feel a bit

193.08 --> 196.28
but still doing good

197.819 --> 202.26
got a nice surprise donation

200.76 --> 206.54
yesterday

202.26 --> 206.54
evening from Nerdy ee again

206.94 --> 209.9
that was pretty cool

211.739 --> 215.0
trolls are still

216.239 --> 223.4
at it

218.76 --> 223.39999999999998
I see very very quickly

230.28 --> 236.239
right but yeah it's logical they're all

232.68 --> 236.239
very very triggered

240.72 --> 247.58
for yeah blatantly obvious reasons they

243.18 --> 247.58
got nowhere to go ball has nowhere to go

259.079 --> 261.56
right

262.5 --> 265.639
hey Matthew Hall

277.38 --> 282.259
since I know you like slurping so much

279.78 --> 282.25899999999996
trolls

285.479 --> 288.32
you love it

289.44 --> 292.759
no I'm loving it anyway

292.8 --> 296.06
nice mint tea

308.46 --> 313.13899999999995
right

311.039 --> 315.479
yeah it's getting really silly with all

313.139 --> 318.78000000000003
these trolls it started up kind of like

315.479 --> 324.08
two days ago and

318.78 --> 324.08
well I'm the weird thing is

324.18 --> 328.979
I don't like it not because oh no the

327.18 --> 331.08
troll it's because

328.979 --> 335.15999999999997
they kind of

331.08 --> 337.08
gave me the tendency to bully them so I

335.16 --> 338.94
don't like these trolls

337.08 --> 342.3
not so much because they're really a

338.94 --> 343.8
burden although they are a nuisance a

342.3 --> 346.5
distraction

343.8 --> 349.139
but because they turned me into a bully

346.5 --> 353.24
against them

349.139 --> 353.24
and I don't like that

353.58 --> 362.09999999999997
I like like the the reserved

358.139 --> 365.639
more focused wisdom are win a lot more

362.1 --> 367.97900000000004
than me just digging in their heads and

365.639 --> 369.72
just crushing them

367.979 --> 371.88
right even though of course that is

369.72 --> 374.58000000000004
entertaining and all that and they

371.88 --> 377.88
deserve it

374.58 --> 381.35999999999996
it's still like I don't like doing that

377.88 --> 384.36
as much as just being with you guys

381.36 --> 386.819
and thinking

384.36 --> 391.259
thinking fast and deep

386.819 --> 393.90000000000003
I like that more anyway but yes it's a

391.259 --> 396.90000000000003
natural hazards trolls come and go

393.9 --> 399.23999999999995
they'll wake up they need to

396.9 --> 401.75899999999996
they need somebody to Rattle their cages

399.24 --> 404.28000000000003
because they are definitely in a cage

401.759 --> 408.38
for sure

404.28 --> 408.38
hey wrath and the goods

408.6 --> 411.08000000000004
right

412.5 --> 418.08
so yesterday's Flat Earth debate was

414.419 --> 420.25899999999996
pretty good although I I was barely in

418.08 --> 420.25899999999996
it

420.419 --> 424.15999999999997
I was tired a lot

427.74 --> 432.78000000000003
all that

430.38 --> 435.96
as I explained yesterday also it's like

432.78 --> 439.08
all this mathematical technicals and

435.96 --> 441.23999999999995
just like really focusing on like the

439.08 --> 444.599
perfected oversight over the

441.24 --> 447.84000000000003
consequences of it all

444.599 --> 450.96
I find it a bit tedious because it's not

447.84 --> 453.65999999999997
my main focus like even me and Brian had

450.96 --> 455.81899999999996
a conversation about it afterward that

453.66 --> 457.68
he loves that stuff he's like all about

455.819 --> 460.5
the math and he's so focused and he

457.68 --> 461.819
likes doing that he's kind of a nerd but

460.5 --> 464.639
hey

461.819 --> 467.47900000000004
great nerd and with a nerd with dignity

464.639 --> 467.479
so

468.599 --> 474.78
but I am different I'm psychology

472.62 --> 477.539
I'm all about this the spiritual

474.78 --> 480.17999999999995
mechanics and Brian recognized that

477.539 --> 481.919
about me as well so yeah

480.18 --> 484.56
I'm very glad

481.919 --> 487.979
to be surrounded by people that are very

484.56 --> 491.16
good at that it's just I'm not I'm never

487.979 --> 493.56
gonna be a real star at it it's

491.16 --> 495.24
it's also the reason why I tend to then

493.56 --> 497.819
kind of

495.24 --> 499.56
fumble a bit as I tried to like

497.819 --> 503.22
oversimplify

499.56 --> 505.919
what's going on I don't always hit hid

503.22 --> 509.96000000000004
On Target straight away

505.919 --> 509.96
but then eventually usually I do

518.039 --> 520.76
no

534.66 --> 540.26
every time the moon is full the trolls

537.12 --> 540.26
get out of control

543.839 --> 547.74
yeah they become restless and when they

545.82 --> 549.98
become Restless they just start nagging

547.74 --> 549.98
everybody

552.0 --> 555.98
that's true Ralph Rodriguez

560.16 --> 567.26
good to see you by the way

562.86 --> 567.26
hey refracted curvature hello

571.32 --> 574.1
what

574.5 --> 579.24
seriously Ballers they're now claiming

577.2 --> 580.8000000000001
position if the stars have nothing to do

579.24 --> 584.16
with the Earth's surface

580.8 --> 586.68
I'm not so sure about that

584.16 --> 589.38
hey Michael Khan

586.68 --> 595.279
good to see you dude like that video you

589.38 --> 595.279
uploaded today was really really heavy

596.459 --> 602.16
man I watch I had to watch it all the

599.279 --> 604.7
way to the end it's so intense very

602.16 --> 604.6999999999999
fascinating

604.86 --> 611.04
and like because

607.5 --> 613.26
it had all the footage right it had all

611.04 --> 614.9399999999999
like that's that's almost like

613.26 --> 617.519
perplexing right

614.94 --> 620.22
a lot of people have like written uh

617.519 --> 623.04
read the Old Testament stories

620.22 --> 625.7
and they know the descriptions and then

623.04 --> 628.86
to kind of like have things summarized

625.7 --> 631.86
with actual camera footage

628.86 --> 634.2
on what seems very much to be that

631.86 --> 635.64
location as it is being told that's like

634.2 --> 638.94
astounding

635.64 --> 640.459
that is that was really like whoa

638.94 --> 643.86
heavy

640.459 --> 646.92
right because it wasn't it it was really

643.86 --> 649.2
about the reference and about like look

646.92 --> 650.64
over here it wasn't just oh chanting

649.2 --> 653.6400000000001
chanting

650.64 --> 655.92
that sort of nonsense it was really

653.64 --> 658.5
was not about belief or about some

655.92 --> 660.959
chanting riddle it was just like yeah

658.5 --> 663.12
this it happened in the Bible they went

660.959 --> 664.56
over there and then just look look at

663.12 --> 668.3
the research we did look at that

664.56 --> 668.3
location it's just wow

668.459 --> 674.42
really heavy video I definitely

670.56 --> 674.42
recommend everybody to watch that

675.36 --> 679.82
it's very heavy

680.399 --> 683.779
I'll link your video up

685.5 --> 688.339
hey guys

689.1 --> 693.5600000000001
yeah it's an hour long but man

695.88 --> 699.3
there you go

697.68 --> 701.8199999999999
yeah that's Michael Khan's video

699.3 --> 704.0999999999999
definitely check it out somewhere

701.82 --> 707.0400000000001
today

704.1 --> 709.86
and you'll probably find it like if

707.04 --> 711.779
you're a Biblical believer you just

709.86 --> 713.76
based on that alone you'll find it worth

711.779 --> 717.2
sharing

713.76 --> 717.2
really intense anyway

735.0 --> 740.459
yeah refracted curvature yeah well

737.76 --> 743.519
that's their new that's their new tactic

740.459 --> 746.2199999999999
isn't it refracted curve

743.519 --> 748.74
they say things that are so ridiculous

746.22 --> 751.0790000000001
and self-contradicting that it's just

748.74 --> 754.32
hilarious and then they

751.079 --> 757.279
they silence Us by making us unable to

754.32 --> 757.279
stop laughing

757.86 --> 763.6800000000001
so we can't respond it's so ridiculous

760.44 --> 766.019
we we end up just laughing and then

763.68 --> 768.18
effectively conceding in the moment

766.019 --> 770.1
because of that

768.18 --> 772.4399999999999
because we just can't handle how

770.1 --> 775.6800000000001
ridiculous it is anymore

772.44 --> 778.139
and then they think they win

775.68 --> 781.38
it's a pretty sophisticated

778.139 --> 785.1800000000001
psychological warfare if you ask me I

781.38 --> 785.18
wonder if they even realize that

785.3 --> 792.7199999999999
baldjitsu yeah it's it is definitely

790.079 --> 795.019
becoming like a fighting Sports type

792.72 --> 795.019
thing

795.36 --> 801.84
no Phil from Dunner

798.72 --> 801.84
[Music]

815.94 --> 822.74
now YouTube that's that's really

818.76 --> 822.74
annoying and stupid thing to say

823.94 --> 830.1600000000001
Nostradamus is not just so it's not just

828.54 --> 833.519
a bunch of blabbering and something must

830.16 --> 836.639
be true that's not what that was at all

833.519 --> 837.66
I'm not saying that it was like Godly or

836.639 --> 840.6
anything

837.66 --> 843.24
but it wasn't just random

840.6 --> 846.44
that's the whole point about it like he

843.24 --> 846.44
did something weird

849.06 --> 854.399
it's like I think sometime like every

851.699 --> 856.26
time I talk even remotely touch anything

854.399 --> 858.019
from nostradam I get the feeling that

856.26 --> 860.76
that guy was like

858.019 --> 862.74
completely sunk into fractal thinking

860.76 --> 865.139
and he just couldn't translate it

862.74 --> 867.5600000000001
properly anymore so it almost came out

865.139 --> 867.5600000000001
in code

867.899 --> 871.5
like it was too much to handle that's

869.94 --> 873.4200000000001
what I think I think in nostradam

871.5 --> 875.579
because yeah there's a lot of just

873.42 --> 877.5
interesting patterns

875.579 --> 879.8599999999999
anyway

877.5 --> 879.86
right

880.68 --> 886.279
that's just me maybe but it wasn't just

883.8 --> 886.279
random

890.76 --> 894.3199999999999
okay Phil from Dunner

895.8 --> 900.139
I think going lawn mower all right

901.68 --> 905.88
it can't be easy using a flat Earth

904.079 --> 908.519
model to claim the Earth is a sphere

905.88 --> 910.56
while it's actually really easy all you

908.519 --> 915.12
have to do is just don't think about

910.56 --> 918.2399999999999
that part and I am confident that

915.12 --> 920.399
as they were originally learning this

918.24 --> 924.0600000000001
sort of thing in school as they started

920.399 --> 927.54
up that mechanical process of reifying

924.06 --> 930.779
they already found out

927.54 --> 933.42
that there are flat that that's that

930.779 --> 935.519
it's all based on a flat system and then

933.42 --> 937.259
they were told to ignore that and then

935.519 --> 939.24
they went with that and then they kind

937.259 --> 941.399
of forgot about that part so they kind

939.24 --> 944.279
of hid it in plain sight

941.399 --> 946.8
I think they always knew because I

944.279 --> 950.88
remember in the beginnings

946.8 --> 952.68
that I had been confronting that I was

950.88 --> 956.06
because I was always just kind of

952.68 --> 956.06
nagging testing so

956.279 --> 960.72
when I found out like wait but that

958.259 --> 962.88
means it's flat and then they just said

960.72 --> 966.48
like no you have to ignore that and then

962.88 --> 970.079
I accepted that I remember accepting it

966.48 --> 971.4590000000001
when I faced it you see I remember it as

970.079 --> 973.8
a baller

971.459 --> 975.42
that I faced it at the beginning and

973.8 --> 979.019
then I accepted it

975.42 --> 981.06
I prioritized the mission of just

979.019 --> 983.519
the process

981.06 --> 985.8
figuring it out

983.519 --> 990.12
things were overlooked

985.8 --> 993.18
I was told to and I accepted at the time

990.12 --> 996.839
and I think that most Ballers get the

993.18 --> 1000.579
face similar situations somewhere might

996.839 --> 1000.5790000000001
have been a long time ago for some

1013.639 --> 1020.899
Ballers found Fe in 2015 then jumped

1017.54 --> 1023.92
chip and then come back now yeah but

1020.899 --> 1023.92
that happens all the time

1033.26 --> 1038.48
like

1035.299 --> 1040.6399999999999
when Ball even when Ballers or anti-flat

1038.48 --> 1042.74
earthers get into this letter situation

1040.64 --> 1044.539
it is really surreal right they're

1042.74 --> 1046.76
constantly confronted with things that

1044.539 --> 1049.46
are beyond their grip

1046.76 --> 1053.419
and that almost places them in a

1049.46 --> 1055.94
completely different frequency as just

1053.419 --> 1059.48
normal societal operation

1055.94 --> 1061.52
so then when they eject because it's too

1059.48 --> 1063.559
much like their life is literally

1061.52 --> 1065.6
unraveling because they're over focused

1063.559 --> 1067.58
on the flat earthing

1065.6 --> 1069.9189999999999
then they eject then they forget all

1067.58 --> 1071.84
about it

1069.919 --> 1073.88
and then at some point they're like hmm

1071.84 --> 1076.6399999999999
oh yeah I should get back to that Flat

1073.88 --> 1078.5590000000002
Earth and then it's just like it starts

1076.64 --> 1081.5
all over again

1078.559 --> 1084.2
right because unlike

1081.5 --> 1085.94
oh me and Nathan and other like more

1084.2 --> 1087.799
dedicated flat authors that have been

1085.94 --> 1089.5
doing this and holding on for a very

1087.799 --> 1094.16
long time

1089.5 --> 1097.4
we've let it all end grain in US like

1094.16 --> 1100.039
we're not gonna lose that information

1097.4 --> 1102.8600000000001
but a lot of people they tap into it

1100.039 --> 1104.539
they just wrestle with it and then they

1102.86 --> 1106.6999999999998
drop out and then they forget all about

1104.539 --> 1108.32
it and so they start over again when

1106.7 --> 1111.7
they come back

1108.32 --> 1111.7
it only makes sense

1114.74 --> 1119.539
right and they only have that's right

1116.84 --> 1121.6399999999999
the rhetoric is all they have

1119.539 --> 1124.4
right that's all that's also part of the

1121.64 --> 1127.3400000000001
the weird part about the psychology

1124.4 --> 1129.2
if they tapped into a flat Earth thing

1127.34 --> 1131.539
as an anti-flat earther through our

1129.2 --> 1133.46
baller and then getting frustrated and

1131.539 --> 1134.96
AD homing and

1133.46 --> 1136.7
yeah getting

1134.96 --> 1138.679
caught in the nonsense when they step

1136.7 --> 1141.8600000000001
out and forget all about it then they

1138.679 --> 1144.2
still get to confront the box right they

1141.86 --> 1146.78
still got the books and the books are

1144.2 --> 1148.3400000000001
just gonna tell the same old story

1146.78 --> 1150.44
and as they're forgetting everything

1148.34 --> 1153.4399999999998
they learned they just start to believe

1150.44 --> 1156.26
that again that's how it works

1153.44 --> 1160.539
it's how it worked with me I'm I'm

1156.26 --> 1160.539
speaking from personal experience here

1166.7 --> 1169.24
right

1176.14 --> 1181.7800000000002
virtual reality will be no careful it

1178.82 --> 1181.78
will never be the norm

1182.0 --> 1190.12
now but it will just be another trendy

1186.64 --> 1190.1200000000001
unhealthy thing

1191.36 --> 1196.34
it's never going to overwhelm the world

1193.16 --> 1197.72
because dude

1196.34 --> 1199.6399999999999
like

1197.72 --> 1202.94
it doesn't work

1199.64 --> 1206.2990000000002
like you can't stay in virtual reality

1202.94 --> 1208.5800000000002
with like the visual interface

1206.299 --> 1211.6399999999999
that's really unhealthy

1208.58 --> 1214.34
like I wouldn't be able to interface

1211.64 --> 1216.5590000000002
with that like longer than just a few

1214.34 --> 1219.08
minutes

1216.559 --> 1220.7
and then I'd get really violently sick

1219.08 --> 1222.22
from it

1220.7 --> 1226.46
like feel like

1222.22 --> 1229.7
like because I I had issues just

1226.46 --> 1231.559
watching it the 3D on the screen with

1229.7 --> 1233.9
first person games

1231.559 --> 1237.3799999999999
and that's like

1233.9 --> 1239.179
14 years ago I had that I had like then

1237.38 --> 1241.8200000000002
I would be playing certain games that

1239.179 --> 1244.22
were looking just super realistic

1241.82 --> 1245.78
and they were kind of scary and then I

1244.22 --> 1248.299
just noticed like after half an hour

1245.78 --> 1249.74
like holy [ __ ] I feel like I need to

1248.299 --> 1253.46
throw up and it would be literally

1249.74 --> 1256.58
hanging over the toilet for 10 minutes

1253.46 --> 1260.78
just from watching that right so can you

1256.58 --> 1264.799
imagine having a 3D thing on your head

1260.78 --> 1267.1399999999999
this you can't stay in that like I can't

1264.799 --> 1269.059
stay in that there will be many people

1267.14 --> 1271.7800000000002
that can't stay in that there will be

1269.059 --> 1271.78
only a few

1272.179 --> 1277.64
like they're I think yeah they couldn't

1275.48 --> 1280.28
possibly be

1277.64 --> 1283.159
more than just a handful of people that

1280.28 --> 1285.559
would even physically be able

1283.159 --> 1287.6000000000001
to pull through that without some

1285.559 --> 1290.059
serious suppressing drugs or something

1287.6 --> 1292.6589999999999
to suppress the sickness and just be

1290.059 --> 1297.3799999999999
interfaced through virtual reality

1292.659 --> 1299.9
constantly 24 7. like

1297.38 --> 1302.419
it's never going to be the norm it's

1299.9 --> 1304.3400000000001
physically impossible

1302.419 --> 1307.539
you see

1304.34 --> 1307.539
this is never gonna work

1316.49 --> 1320.78
[Music]

1318.2 --> 1323.0800000000002
how do we know we're not in one well

1320.78 --> 1323.08
because

1324.62 --> 1327.34
we're not

1332.9 --> 1338.299
right May well not like a VR headset

1336.679 --> 1341.98
thing anyway

1338.299 --> 1341.98
that's blatantly obvious

1342.2 --> 1348.8600000000001
I don't know maybe they have like a

1345.28 --> 1352.299
brain interface but I think that

1348.86 --> 1352.299
I would figure that out

1352.58 --> 1357.32
like people can break their cell

1354.919 --> 1360.679
themselves right they can't do that they

1357.32 --> 1363.3799999999999
can overload their own internal systems

1360.679 --> 1365.8400000000001
if they want to like Escape something

1363.38 --> 1368.5390000000002
bad enough it's part of well Insanity

1365.84 --> 1370.9399999999998
that means that you can also break out

1368.539 --> 1374.419
of any like Matrix plug-in interface

1370.94 --> 1377.539
like that that must be possible

1374.419 --> 1379.46
it would be figured out we're not we're

1377.539 --> 1382.039
not in there

1379.46 --> 1386.539
the only Matrix we're in is the Matrix

1382.039 --> 1390.62
of this Physical Realm creation

1386.539 --> 1393.26
in which our Spirits interface on our

1390.62 --> 1395.6789999999999
seats on our Thrones that are our bodies

1393.26 --> 1395.679
so

1413.24 --> 1415.9
hmm

1421.22 --> 1427.72
no no steamy traveler they don't they

1425.0 --> 1427.72
absolutely don't

1427.82 --> 1434.8999999999999
they're only gonna make it worse

1430.7 --> 1437.779
yes connect it sure right interface

1434.9 --> 1440.419
there might be like there's radio

1437.779 --> 1441.74
receiving capability with with the

1440.419 --> 1444.3200000000002
graphene

1441.74 --> 1446.96
it's in there

1444.32 --> 1450.799
that all makes it worse that all make it

1446.96 --> 1453.799
it none of it is like Precision Nado

1450.799 --> 1457.1589999999999
Nano surgery or something

1453.799 --> 1459.32
that's gonna make you it easier for you

1457.159 --> 1463.22
to interface with freaking virtual

1459.32 --> 1466.299
reality that's not part of this

1463.22 --> 1466.299
that makes no sense

1468.86 --> 1472.779
that's not part of of the Jabs

1481.4 --> 1487.5800000000002
besides how do you even know whether you

1485.179 --> 1489.76
can remove that sickness response maybe

1487.58 --> 1494.299
that's like part of a critical system

1489.76 --> 1496.64
and if you like oh let's Nano damage it

1494.299 --> 1498.32
out of the way like eat that part of

1496.64 --> 1501.919
your brain out you know that's saying

1498.32 --> 1503.539
well what if that kills you then right

1501.919 --> 1505.88
then that means it's never going to work

1503.539 --> 1507.32
it's just going to kill everybody that

1505.88 --> 1508.94
has issues with that right it doesn't

1507.32 --> 1512.799
make any sense

1508.94 --> 1512.799
it's not that guaranteed

1512.9 --> 1516.679
right

1514.299 --> 1518.9
maybe the internet of people the

1516.679 --> 1520.76
internet of bodies yeah that that is a

1518.9 --> 1524.659
concept I've been hearing

1520.76 --> 1527.96
it could be part of of the of the Jab

1524.659 --> 1530.779
system that's been rolling out through

1527.96 --> 1534.74
the nanographene and all that

1530.779 --> 1537.44
but yeah that's an antenna that's not

1534.74 --> 1540.44
like modifying

1537.44 --> 1541.4
like brain function and all that nerve

1540.44 --> 1546.46
function

1541.4 --> 1546.46
to accommodate some kind of Technology

1552.559 --> 1558.2
drama mean okay

1556.1 --> 1560.5
okay so that's just a drug that does

1558.2 --> 1560.5
that

1560.539 --> 1563.539
you know what also removes motion

1562.279 --> 1566.32
sickness

1563.539 --> 1566.32
Ginger

1574.039 --> 1577.94
hmm

1575.6 --> 1581.0
right but I don't care because I don't

1577.94 --> 1583.3600000000001
want virtual reality screw that I don't

1581.0 --> 1583.36
want it

1597.38 --> 1602.9
I'd much rather have like a hollow deck

1600.26 --> 1605.419
like experiences right

1602.9 --> 1607.6000000000001
you have to be able to literally be your

1605.419 --> 1607.6000000000001
body

1612.14 --> 1618.2
and if if you'd be able to like have a

1615.08 --> 1622.22
room that I don't know how

1618.2 --> 1624.919
be able to basically 3D project

1622.22 --> 1628.1000000000001
things in a way that

1624.919 --> 1630.38
you would like as you remember the 3D

1628.1 --> 1632.9599999999998
picture effects

1630.38 --> 1635.72
but more sophisticated just make

1632.96 --> 1639.32
everything look like 3D to you basically

1635.72 --> 1641.24
an illusion of 3D on it onto these

1639.32 --> 1642.9189999999999
surfaces surrounding you

1641.24 --> 1646.58
think that might be much more

1642.919 --> 1651.46
interesting option for me personally

1646.58 --> 1651.46
because the goggles never worked for me

1658.279 --> 1664.659
besides it's really annoying to carry

1660.86 --> 1664.6589999999999
like a weight on your head

1665.12 --> 1667.539
like that

1671.779 --> 1676.34
real reality is virtue enough as it is

1674.299 --> 1680.559
yeah

1676.34 --> 1680.559
that's crazy enough as it is right now

1682.279 --> 1686.96
but maybe that's also part of like the

1684.679 --> 1689.24
campaign strategy is like oh look at the

1686.96 --> 1691.3990000000001
virtual reality at least this is more

1689.24 --> 1693.64
simple

1691.399 --> 1696.1399999999999
than all this sophisticated

1693.64 --> 1697.3990000000001
responsibility and all that in the real

1696.14 --> 1701.38
world

1697.399 --> 1701.3799999999999
right escapism it's always escapism

1714.44 --> 1718.8990000000001
consensus reality is virtual yeah good

1716.72 --> 1718.8990000000001
point

1746.48 --> 1749.38
okay

1767.059 --> 1772.76
all right Gil Ambrose are you okay

1770.96 --> 1775.179
might want to do something about the

1772.76 --> 1775.179
caps

1787.279 --> 1789.46
foreign

1796.899 --> 1802.2199999999998
yeah I'm sorry but I'm doing a show

1799.22 --> 1805.34
right now it yeah

1802.22 --> 1808.6000000000001
I sit around on my show that's what I do

1805.34 --> 1808.6
during my show I'm sorry

1837.38 --> 1845.2600000000002
oh yeah fast YouTube to come on

1841.34 --> 1845.26
so that endless [ __ ]

1853.36 --> 1860.4189999999999
okay you got owned man

1857.84 --> 1863.86
it's bad oh what the [ __ ] are you

1860.419 --> 1863.8600000000001
talking about yo Ambrose

1864.5 --> 1868.82
dude

1866.179 --> 1872.8600000000001
have you recently changed meds because

1868.82 --> 1872.86
you sound quite insane right now

1876.08 --> 1880.279
like

1877.279 --> 1883.22
you be my Handler really

1880.279 --> 1885.2
really you think you can handle me gil

1883.22 --> 1889.059
Ambrose

1885.2 --> 1889.059
think you're a little delusional there

1895.34 --> 1899.48
do never have dead air well do you have

1898.159 --> 1902.5
a show

1899.48 --> 1902.5
do you have anything

1911.84 --> 1916.899
what the [ __ ] well that's actually you

1917.419 --> 1924.8200000000002
all right so you do have a show

1921.08 --> 1924.82
not very regular one

1942.32 --> 1948.32
looks like you mostly talk about [ __ ]

1945.32 --> 1948.32
[ __ ]

1949.1 --> 1955.1589999999999
yeah literally you talk about the worst

1952.159 --> 1958.279
possible crap literally worst possible

1955.159 --> 1960.8600000000001
crap so I'm sorry

1958.279 --> 1964.88
I'm very glad that you can endlessly

1960.86 --> 1966.74
ramble on about literal trash things and

1964.88 --> 1970.3400000000001
trash subjects

1966.74 --> 1972.559
like a low-life scumbag but yeah I'm not

1970.34 --> 1975.08
competing with that I'm actually talking

1972.559 --> 1979.6399999999999
about more interesting things in

1975.08 --> 1983.4189999999999
sophisticated things spiritual mechanics

1979.64 --> 1984.919
right and there will be pauses because I

1983.419 --> 1987.98
don't give a [ __ ]

1984.919 --> 1990.0800000000002
I'll just sit there with my mouth closed

1987.98 --> 1993.019
staring at you for five [ __ ] minutes

1990.08 --> 1994.76
if I feel like it okay

1993.019 --> 1997.519
I can do that

1994.76 --> 1999.86
because I don't give a [ __ ] I'll just

1997.519 --> 2003.7
stare at the screen five minutes silent

1999.86 --> 2005.62
when I [ __ ] feel like it okay

2003.7 --> 2009.3990000000001
because I am not here

2005.62 --> 2012.6
two to compose myself towards some

2009.399 --> 2017.279
stupid standardized format

2012.6 --> 2017.279
media training go [ __ ] yourself

2018.46 --> 2025.8400000000001
get the [ __ ] out of here scumbag you

2021.58 --> 2030.34
filthy low-life scumbag Gil Ambrose

2025.84 --> 2032.799
you're a filthy low-life scumbag

2030.34 --> 2036.1
guys seriously check out his freaking

2032.799 --> 2040.62
Channel look at what he reviews

2036.1 --> 2043.1789999999999
that guy is a literal low-life scumbag

2040.62 --> 2047.1999999999998
trash bin

2043.179 --> 2047.2
[ __ ] face scumbag

2065.27 --> 2068.5
[Music]

2066.879 --> 2071.0789999999997
you're not going to check out his

2068.5 --> 2073.24
Channel or good I wouldn't check out but

2071.079 --> 2075.3990000000003

they are the proper priest of Christ

2570.72 --> 2577.2999999999997

2625.06 --> 2630.819
do what I was inherently born to be able

2628.42 --> 2634.3

2630.819 --> 2639.0
yeah that's called a design a design

2634.3 --> 2639.0
ability God designs our abilities

2641.859 --> 2645.5789999999997
that's not

2643.54 --> 2647.2
witchcraft that's not oh I'm

2645.579 --> 2650.1600000000003
surrendering to the devil no that's

2647.2 --> 2650.16
being born with it

2656.28 --> 2663.8190000000004
scumbag see it is it's this

2659.619 --> 2667.92

2663.819 --> 2670.119
troll scumbag guy he's literally

2667.92 --> 2671.6800000000003
slandering Christians with what he's

2670.119 --> 2675.099
doing right now

2671.68 --> 2678.339
by going in the role of a freaking

2675.099 --> 2679.54
fake Christian devil persecutor that's

2678.339 --> 2682.98
what he's doing

2679.54 --> 2682.98
it's absolute trash

2683.44 --> 2690.579
needs to be put in the trash can

2686.859 --> 2693.64
and then compacted and crushed

2690.579 --> 2697.38
and then thrown into the oven I think

2693.64 --> 2697.3799999999997
that's what should happen with you

2698.859 --> 2703.0
yeah

2700.24 --> 2706.0
I think you should be deposited in a

2703.0 --> 2707.92
garbage truck compact it and then thrown

2706.0 --> 2710.319
in the oven I think that would be a

2707.92 --> 2713.7400000000002
proper fate for a person that does what

2710.319 --> 2713.74
you do troll

2779.98 --> 2784.839
literally be a better place in many

2782.14 --> 2788.02
different ways if he did that

2784.839 --> 2791.02
he would save his the burden of his

2788.02 --> 2794.319
uselessness on society

2791.02 --> 2796.599
he would save himself in irrevocable

2794.319 --> 2799.66
anguish that he must be suffering if

2796.599 --> 2802.119
he's gonna put himself in this position

2808.54 --> 2812.8

3190.68 --> 3199.0789999999997
it's called triangle and it's about like

3192.9 --> 3202.079
this crazy sort of horror Slasher

3199.079 --> 3204.2400000000002
like it's a terrible movie but it's

3202.079 --> 3206.76
about like a Time Loop thing and it's

3204.24 --> 3210.5989999999997
called triangle and he literally just

3206.76 --> 3213.0
starts out singing triangle trying and

3210.599 --> 3215.579
it's just like oh my God that's so

3213.0 --> 3218.04
freaking appropriate it's

3215.579 --> 3220.8
like so I was spamming that link like

3218.04 --> 3223.5589999999997
check this out

3220.8 --> 3226.559
you gotta watch this and then think of

3223.559 --> 3229.559
the Flat Earth debates what's going on

3226.559 --> 3231.079
with the Triangular it's on a ship in

3229.559 --> 3234.9
the ocean guys

3231.079 --> 3238.92
seriously watch it it's

3234.9 --> 3240.119
and like the movie is [ __ ] crazy it's

3238.92 --> 3243.42
like

3240.119 --> 3247.26
so many paradoxes in that movie it's

3243.42 --> 3250.44
mind-boggling it's it's too good to be

3247.26 --> 3253.5200000000004
true on an on a fractal level

3250.44 --> 3253.52
it's crazy

3256.02 --> 3261.96
like yeah I watched the video yesterday

3257.94 --> 3265.04
and I couldn't stop thinking about it

3261.96 --> 3268.14
so check it out it's really crazy movie

3265.04 --> 3269.94
and it's like really funny when you

3268.14 --> 3271.98
compare it to what's going on at the

3269.94 --> 3274.26
Flat Earth debate scene right now

3271.98 --> 3277.859
with the triangulation doesn't require

3274.26 --> 3281.42
triangles and sextants

3277.859 --> 3284.4
that you now only use on land and it

3281.42 --> 3286.92
it's so funny

3284.4 --> 3290.299
if you lay it if you watch that and then

3286.92 --> 3290.299
compare everything that's happening

3291.42 --> 3295.02
and even like the responses from the

3293.7 --> 3299.16
reviewer

3295.02 --> 3301.559
it's seriously guys it's it's like

3299.16 --> 3303.72
another level of synchronicity that's

3301.559 --> 3306.3590000000004
just mind-boggling

3303.72 --> 3310.3999999999996
and this is like 15 years old

3306.359 --> 3310.4
or uh 12 years old

3313.14 --> 3317.5789999999997
watching all right I'm not saying to

3316.02 --> 3319.079
watch it right now well you can watch

3317.579 --> 3321.96
like the first few minutes and then

3319.079 --> 3324.78
you'll get the triangle triangle song

3321.96 --> 3326.28
that's already freaking hilarious

3324.78 --> 3328.559
because that's what I've been hearing

3326.28 --> 3330.1800000000003
every time I I hear like the Ballers not

3328.559 --> 3333.8590000000004
being able to deal with triangles and

3330.18 --> 3337.7599999999998
like triangle triangle

3333.859 --> 3337.7599999999998
yeah you'll see

3338.7 --> 3341.48
uh

3342.98 --> 3350.119
in my Nancy

3346.619 --> 3350.119
okay Michael can

3352.92 --> 3357.599
right by the way the movie he's

3355.44 --> 3361.559
reviewing I wouldn't watch that movie

3357.599 --> 3364.319
that movie looks like it really sucks

3361.559 --> 3367.0400000000004
but the review he made is freaking

3364.319 --> 3367.04
hilarious

3374.579 --> 3379.5
like the review he made is like a lot

3377.099 --> 3381.26
more funny and a lot better and a lot

3379.5 --> 3383.88
more

3381.26 --> 3386.2200000000003
sophisticated than the movie even is the

3383.88 --> 3388.799
movie is just like pretentious it's

3386.22 --> 3391.5589999999997
super pretentious Wanna Be oh we're so

3388.799 --> 3393.839
special oh we're so time loopy but it's

3391.559 --> 3396.5400000000004
really dumb and Ill thought out like

3393.839 --> 3399.54
every part of it is ill thought out

3396.54 --> 3401.339
and he reviews that really great so yeah

3399.54 --> 3403.14
check it out

3401.339 --> 3405.66
I'm surprised that nobody's actually

3403.14 --> 3407.7599999999998
watched it just yet because I was I

3405.66 --> 3409.859
posted it twice

3407.76 --> 3412.619
yesterday

3409.859 --> 3415.64
in kiwi life's chat and I posted it in

3412.619 --> 3415.6400000000003
master B even

3418.26 --> 3425.28
I guess nobody checks out my links

3421.319 --> 3428.88
unless I tell them to you did

3425.28 --> 3432.26
cool what did you think Godzilla

3428.88 --> 3432.26
was it funny or not

3434.16 --> 3438.98
a bit dark right but still funny

3439.859 --> 3444.74
still not happy that I did you thought

3442.079 --> 3444.7400000000002
it was terrible

3444.9 --> 3447.98
was it too dark

3457.859 --> 3463.859
I mean dude if you actually watch him

3460.859 --> 3465.96
you'll see where I didn't really get the

3463.859 --> 3468.619
hype

3465.96 --> 3468.619
okay

3476.04 --> 3480.42
all right well I wouldn't be surprised

3478.02 --> 3482.46
you know I've literally never ex yeah

3480.42 --> 3484.02
I've never met anybody that actually

3482.46 --> 3486.78
thought he was funny

3484.02 --> 3489.48
like all of my friends I've checked all

3486.78 --> 3492.42
of that they never liked it I'm like why

3489.48 --> 3496.02
don't you think that's funny

3492.42 --> 3500.099
I think he's freaking hilarious like a

3496.02 --> 3502.819
bit tragically hilarious maybe but

3500.099 --> 3502.819
I don't know

3504.18 --> 3511.819
one of the best films I have ever seen

3507.839 --> 3511.819
triangle you're joking right

3519.66 --> 3524.46
there's a sort of time Loop movie on a

3522.42 --> 3526.799
ship yeah no [ __ ] Stone monkey that's

3524.46 --> 3529.16
the freaking link I gave you that's the

3526.799 --> 3532.559
review of that movie

3529.16 --> 3537.0589999999997
and that movie is ridiculous

3532.559 --> 3540.059
it's absolutely insane and like it's so

3537.059 --> 3542.9
paradoxical it's almost like ball

3540.059 --> 3546.2400000000002
it's almost heliocentric model level

3542.9 --> 3548.88
paradoxical it's that stupid everything

3546.24 --> 3551.04
about it is wrong everything about it is

3548.88 --> 3552.96
wrong it's morally wrong it's

3551.04 --> 3555.24
technically wrong

3552.96 --> 3557.2200000000003
everybody's a freaking [ __ ] the

3555.24 --> 3559.68
motivations make no damn sense

3557.22 --> 3563.04
whatsoever everything about that movie

3559.68 --> 3565.5
is wrong that's why I think it's funny

3563.04 --> 3567.66
and that's why I don't recommend you to

3565.5 --> 3571.2
actually watch that movie it's stupid

3567.66 --> 3573.799
but the review Feliz made is freaking

3571.2 --> 3573.799
hilarious

3577.079 --> 3580.38
seen it loads of times I'm very sorry

3579.18 --> 3583.0789999999997
for you

3580.38 --> 3585.119
I'm very sorry

3583.079 --> 3587.3390000000004
it's really stupid

3585.119 --> 3590.2200000000003
everything about it is wrong nothing

3587.339 --> 3592.859
about that movie makes sense

3590.22 --> 3594.839
watch the review that I posted and

3592.859 --> 3597.18
you'll understand why because his

3594.839 --> 3600.24
comments are all legitimate

3597.18 --> 3605.46
that's a movie that's that guy is a real

3600.24 --> 3608.9399999999996
movie critic detail guy

3605.46 --> 3611.76
and not like oh no but he gets just into

3608.94 --> 3613.98
clown mode sarcastic about it but he is

3611.76 --> 3618.98
freaking smart

3613.98 --> 3618.98
he put a lot of effort in that video

3623.4 --> 3628.4
anyway

3625.74 --> 3628.3999999999996
uh

3637.5 --> 3642.0
you're not big on online movie reviewers

3639.9 --> 3644.579
well okay fine

3642.0 --> 3647.339
I guess that yeah I was the on I'm the

3644.579 --> 3651.26
only guy that's ever liked it

3647.339 --> 3651.2599999999998
nobody likes him for some reason

3675.42 --> 3679.6800000000003
I'm sure he has a fan base yeah yeah

3677.88 --> 3682.7400000000002
well hey why don't you

3679.68 --> 3685.5589999999997
try to find somebody that you know that

3682.74 --> 3687.7799999999997
likes him I've never met a single person

3685.559 --> 3690.8390000000004
that in face to face

3687.78 --> 3693.6600000000003
in my past that's actually like that guy

3690.839 --> 3696.42
and I'm always disappointed about it

3693.66 --> 3698.7
because I think he's really freaking

3696.42 --> 3701.099
hysterical

3698.7 --> 3703.2
in a kind of weird dark way but it's

3701.099 --> 3705.54
also just like the way he gets

3703.2 --> 3708.24
frustrated about things I resonate with

3705.54 --> 3710.96
that that's exactly how I get frustrated

3708.24 --> 3710.9599999999996
about things

3711.02 --> 3716.339
so I just have a lot of sympathetic

3713.94 --> 3719.579
resonance with him which is kind of

3716.339 --> 3722.0389999999998
weird because he is a bit of a weirdo

3719.579 --> 3724.8590000000004
and he has like

3722.039 --> 3727.8590000000004
what is self-confidence issues or not

3724.859 --> 3730.319
the self-worth issues he has that too

3727.859 --> 3732.66
and he expresses it and I have that and

3730.319 --> 3735.9
I just I like it I like the way he's

3732.66 --> 3738.359
done it over the over the ages I still

3735.9 --> 3742.46
re-watch his videos

3738.359 --> 3742.46
because they really make me laugh

3747.72 --> 3753.5
and guys that you gotta realize that's

3750.42 --> 3755.94
the guy that's made a video like

3753.5 --> 3759.24
with script and everything he is own

3755.94 --> 3761.2200000000003
acting a lot of work and he like puts

3759.24 --> 3763.4399999999996
all I think he puts like most of his

3761.22 --> 3766.14
time in the week on it right

3763.44 --> 3768.059
and he's been doing it

3766.14 --> 3770.8799999999997
since

3768.059 --> 3774.2400000000002
2000

3770.88 --> 3774.2400000000002
since 2008

3774.9 --> 3782.059
so that's the guy that's been going for

3777.42 --> 3782.059
a long time doing his thing

3787.079 --> 3792.9
and right it's yes especially his old

3789.72 --> 3794.22
work it's it's just really hardcore

3792.9 --> 3797.579
foreign

3794.22 --> 3799.859
and you can still see how we had he had

3797.579 --> 3802.02
personal issues back then like he had he

3799.859 --> 3805.14
had been suffering from depression I

3802.02 --> 3807.48
think he pretty much got over it

3805.14 --> 3809.94
but you can see that those things you

3807.48 --> 3812.76
can see just genuine personal things

3809.94 --> 3815.4
about him in how he does what he does

3812.76 --> 3818.0
whatever man I think he's freaking

3815.4 --> 3818.0
hysterical

3820.98 --> 3828.26
is that the triangle guy that's the

3824.16 --> 3828.2599999999998
reviewer that revealed triangle yes

3832.799 --> 3838.02
I don't know anybody in that stupid

3835.319 --> 3840.2
movie none of the actors I give a [ __ ]

3838.02 --> 3840.2
about

3867.0 --> 3871.859
right anyway we can still move on I

3869.76 --> 3876.119
didn't really want the entire show to be

3871.859 --> 3879.359
about that I'm just like

3876.119 --> 3881.94
every time I try like hey check this out

3879.359 --> 3885.5989999999997
what do you think like nobody [ __ ]

3881.94 --> 3888.599
response like nobody

3885.599 --> 3891.059
I literally just have to Ram everybody

3888.599 --> 3892.7000000000003
over the head with to even get a

3891.059 --> 3896.4
response about it

3892.7 --> 3898.68
every single time for like the last

3896.4 --> 3902.2400000000002
decade

3898.68 --> 3902.24
like what is this

3905.039 --> 3908.1600000000003
yeah no okay yeah you did check it out

3907.2 --> 3910.3799999999997
but

3908.16 --> 3913.52
like even you said you didn't like it

3910.38 --> 3913.52
for [ __ ] sake

3924.78 --> 3928.799
you've watched this dude before really

3926.94 --> 3931.52
at least G

3928.799 --> 3931.52
huh

3931.68 --> 3937.3999999999996
well he's been around for a long time oh

3933.96 --> 3937.4
and he's Canadian by the way

3939.599 --> 3943.7400000000002
all right Garza now I appreciate that

3941.4 --> 3945.78
look this is not this wasn't meant to be

3943.74 --> 3947.5789999999997
like a personal Guilt Trip like how dare

3945.78 --> 3949.8590000000004
you not watch that witch I have posted

3947.579 --> 3953.1600000000003
it's just a general assessment that like

3949.859 --> 3957.5989999999997
I'm weirded out every time in the last

3953.16 --> 3959.8799999999997
decade that I was like oh check this out

3957.599 --> 3963.26
nobody cares

3959.88 --> 3963.26
every single time

3964.319 --> 3968.4
I guess you watched it but it wasn't

3966.299 --> 3970.559
like hey Arwin oh yeah I watched that

3968.4 --> 3973.94
and ha that wasn't no no I had to

3970.559 --> 3973.94
literally bring it up again

3974.16 --> 3979.2
and that that was my point this is not

3976.38 --> 3981.6600000000003
personal criticism towards you Godzilla

3979.2 --> 3984.5989999999997
it's just a general

3981.66 --> 3987.2
is that the Canadian with losers

3984.599 --> 3987.2000000000003
well

3987.72 --> 3991.7599999999998
what a hoser what

3992.94 --> 3997.46
is that a Canadian thing

4013.099 --> 4018.1600000000003
oh okay

4015.38 --> 4018.1600000000003
what

4039.859 --> 4043.5789999999997
coined by Bob and Doug I never heard of

4042.92 --> 4047.6800000000003
them

4043.579 --> 4047.6800000000003
Godzilla don't know what that is

4060.02 --> 4066.859
oh is that hoser is like a word and from

4064.28 --> 4068.7200000000003
Bob and Doug McKenzie and that's like a

4066.859 --> 4072.38
Canadian show or something

4068.72 --> 4072.3799999999997
right okay

4073.16 --> 4077.7799999999997
I've heard it before I just didn't need

4075.619 --> 4080.0
to know where it came from apparently

4077.78 --> 4082.6600000000003
it's from Canada

4080.0 --> 4082.66
all right

4089.31 --> 4092.46
[Music]

4107.12 --> 4109.659
oh

4128.839 --> 4137.96
oh okay Godzilla so that's a Hosier it's

4132.62 --> 4137.96
an ice hockey related job okay

4146.48 --> 4153.879999999999
the janitor of the ice rink

4150.56 --> 4153.88
right makes sense

4162.56 --> 4167.4800000000005
I got the feeling the flatter of debates

4164.659 --> 4170.9
is going to be quite

4167.48 --> 4173.7789999999995
loud and trolley again

4170.9 --> 4176.48
because the the trolls come back right

4173.779 --> 4179.120000000001
he hasn't done anything now for at least

4176.48 --> 4183.218999999999
15 minutes so I think he's probably now

4179.12 --> 4183.219
on the Discord nagging Nathan

4183.319 --> 4185.859
foreign

4197.02 --> 4201.38
I think I'm just gonna call him akumo

4199.76 --> 4203.4800000000005
viruses [ __ ]

4201.38 --> 4206.08
I think that would be a proper title

4203.48 --> 4206.08
that will stick

4222.62 --> 4228.32
oh look Godzilla

4225.14 --> 4231.38
there's somebody that disagrees with the

4228.32 --> 4235.299999999999
origin of the word hoser Robert digital

4231.38 --> 4235.3
why don't you explain it then

4241.51 --> 4244.549
[Music]

4268.96 --> 4273.04
akumu's [ __ ] yeah that's right

4276.02 --> 4279.660000000001
foreign

4277.64 --> 4282.71
come on

4279.66 --> 4282.71
[Applause]

4308.54 --> 4315.14
no Robert why don't you just freaking

4311.48 --> 4317.5599999999995
share something yeah

4315.14 --> 4320.54
I don't like that you do that every time

4317.56 --> 4324.56
if you figure out that something

4320.54 --> 4326.9
somebody says is wrong don't just say it

4324.56 --> 4330.080000000001
knows wrong there's nothing to do

4326.9 --> 4332.36
explain where what it is then why don't

4330.08 --> 4335.0599999999995
if you know something is wrong then

4332.36 --> 4338.599999999999
actually share it

4335.06 --> 4341.42
don't tell us to look it up

4338.6 --> 4343.6990000000005
if you're gonna be a smart ass and like

4341.42 --> 4347.7390000000005
correct somebody then actually correct

4343.699 --> 4347.739
them and share what it is

4350.659 --> 4355.0599999999995
it's really annoying when you act like

4352.88 --> 4355.06
this

4357.62 --> 4363.739
yeah well I don't give a [ __ ] do your

4360.5 --> 4366.199
own research yeah

4363.739 --> 4367.94
if he knows something is wrong then

4366.199 --> 4370.759999999999
actually correct it

4367.94 --> 4373.28
don't tell us to do our own research

4370.76 --> 4376.88
right it's not even an important it's

4373.28 --> 4379.42
about a freaking comedy word origin who

4376.88 --> 4382.6990000000005
gives a [ __ ]

4379.42 --> 4385.82
seriously if it's wrong then correct us

4382.699 --> 4390.159
don't tell us to [ __ ] Google it

4385.82 --> 4390.159
it's really annoying when you do that

4403.52 --> 4408.92
the triangle guy was funny letter Sage

4406.219 --> 4411.62
oh cool you actually liked him

4408.92 --> 4415.06
huh he's called phallus by the way

4411.62 --> 4415.0599999999995
that's his character name

4428.9 --> 4432.86
anyway yeah glad you liked it I'm I'm

4431.12 --> 4436.88
stunned

4432.86 --> 4440.199
flatter Sage actually likes that wow

4436.88 --> 4440.1990000000005
that's rare

4442.94 --> 4449.08
right there's by the way like

4446.42 --> 4449.08
another

4449.12 --> 4456.0199999999995
200 videos or so

4452.96 --> 4457.94
of other movies he's reviewed

4456.02 --> 4460.280000000001
this was one of the best ones though

4457.94 --> 4462.46
this was one of his best made videos I

4460.28 --> 4462.46
thought

4485.3 --> 4490.64
so you agree people who say do your own

4487.699 --> 4493.839999999999
research are annoying yeah especially if

4490.64 --> 4493.84
they're just in chat

4494.92 --> 4500.78
especially after they have just

4497.659 --> 4502.46
criticized somebody for being wrong yeah

4500.78 --> 4506.54
if you criticize somebody for being

4502.46 --> 4509.0
wrong and then you tell them Google it

4506.54 --> 4511.699
that makes me want to tell them to well

4509.0 --> 4513.44
[ __ ] off then it's just gonna be a dick

4511.699 --> 4515.0599999999995
about it

4513.44 --> 4517.639999999999
if you're gonna correct somebody then

4515.06 --> 4521.42
actually correct them and give the data

4517.64 --> 4524.9800000000005
don't tell them to look for it

4521.42 --> 4524.9800000000005
that's really annoying

4559.699 --> 4562.659
foreign

4575.739 --> 4580.178999999999
nobody knows how to help Rocket Man

4597.5 --> 4605.48
oh [ __ ] that's a hoser James Mason it's

4602.239 --> 4608.08
a fuel stealer is that a hoser

4605.48 --> 4608.08
damn

4627.98 --> 4630.58
hmm

4654.199 --> 4658.699
all right okay well thank you for

4656.6 --> 4661.76
sharing that

4658.699 --> 4665.54
would have been nice if

4661.76 --> 4667.9400000000005
Robert would have actually just said

4665.54 --> 4672.34
that right doesn't seem like too much of

4667.94 --> 4672.339999999999
an effort to actually just say that

4674.179 --> 4681.28
but anyway now we know thanks

4677.659 --> 4681.28
thanks for sharing that detail

4688.219 --> 4691.78
right but it makes sense

4693.14 --> 4697.280000000001
because yeah somebody would that would

4695.239 --> 4700.82
do that would be not very popular

4697.28 --> 4704.599999999999
obviously it's basically like a

4700.82 --> 4707.42
a parasite Thief very annoying

4704.6 --> 4708.56
a hoser

4707.42 --> 4710.659
yeah

4708.56 --> 4713.84
well I don't know why you would like oh

4710.659 --> 4716.599999999999
look at that stupid Hoser

4713.84 --> 4719.06
flattening the ice at a hockey game oh

4716.6 --> 4721.6990000000005
that's so pathetic no no it's just just

4719.06 --> 4723.679
a job right but yeah somebody that

4721.699 --> 4726.259999999999
actually steals fuel

4723.679 --> 4728.9
from people yeah that's really freaking

4726.26 --> 4732.52
annoying so that makes much more sense

4728.9 --> 4732.5199999999995
to that it's based on that

4738.02 --> 4743.3
polite Canadian word for thief okay yeah

4740.719 --> 4745.94
exactly

4743.3 --> 4748.2390000000005
right but Petty Thief right it's a petty

4745.94 --> 4748.239
Thief

4750.92 --> 4755.4800000000005
it's not like a bank robber or something

4752.78 --> 4759.159
it's just somebody that's really yeah

4755.48 --> 4759.159
stealing fuel it's quite Petty
