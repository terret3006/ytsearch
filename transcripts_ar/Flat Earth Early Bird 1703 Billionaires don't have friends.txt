190.44 --> 196.64
20° so it's colder than yesterday but it

193.92 --> 199.64
feels warmer than yesterday

196.64 --> 199.64
okay

201.4 --> 206.84
sure yeah for some reason yesterday was

204.159 --> 210.48
just a shitty day I don't know what it

206.84 --> 214.28
was hey drunken bullet 411 good

210.48 --> 216.959
you but just something went wrong

214.28 --> 218.159
yesterday even during the show with my

216.959 --> 220.92000000000002
mood and

218.159 --> 223.56
everything it's like what I wanted to

220.92 --> 225.83999999999997
roll out didn't roll

223.56 --> 229.0
out and

225.84 --> 232.519
then it

229.0 --> 236.319
just the whole thing just became worse

232.519 --> 236.31900000000002
and worse and it just became so

238.079 --> 242.31900000000002
agitated is a real bummer

243.079 --> 247.959
yesterday especially compared to the day

245.599 --> 250.959
before like makes me look really manic

247.959 --> 254.56
depressed I mean the Saturday show was

250.959 --> 258.88
just hilarious it was I was super happy

254.56 --> 261.0
and just funny things all around and

258.88 --> 264.15999999999997
yesterday was exactly the opposite it

261.0 --> 264.16
was just

265.199 --> 271.84000000000003
cranky was

268.12 --> 273.16
weird all right so yeah I hope today

271.84 --> 275.23999999999995
well today is not going to be that long

273.16 --> 277.199
a show because yeser I just wanted to

275.24 --> 279.84000000000003
round out the show after a

277.199 --> 282.91900000000004
point but then I thought like but yeah I

279.84 --> 284.32
kind of ow you owe you guys a little bit

282.919 --> 288.479
longer

284.32 --> 291.039
show but I couldn't really make it work

288.479 --> 295.0
so sorry about

291.039 --> 295.0
that hello slow moon

297.72 --> 302.52000000000004
buggy I mean it was affect ly ranting

300.36 --> 304.24
and raving against teret even though he

302.52 --> 307.639
didn't deserve that at

304.24 --> 309.28000000000003
all but I was just frustrated in general

307.639 --> 313.639
so

309.28 --> 313.63899999999995
much of these freaking

314.16 --> 318.88000000000005
trolls actual people basically trying to

317.639 --> 322.12
slip

318.88 --> 325.52
in and then do their thing

322.12 --> 328.479
again be obstructive again in the same

325.52 --> 333.52
way secretly with a new it's just

328.479 --> 333.52
like I'm so sick of it I don't want him

335.72 --> 338.72
here

345.479 --> 350.84
like I mean if it's so fascinating and

348.56 --> 352.88
all that like he can just leave comments

350.84 --> 356.479
if he really wants to right I'm not

352.88 --> 356.479
going to delete his

357.44 --> 362.36
comments right or most troll comments

360.12 --> 364.199
unless they're just really just mean and

362.36 --> 366.84000000000003
all that I don't really remove them like

364.199 --> 368.68
if somebody has some technical objection

366.84 --> 371.35999999999996
even though it's very wrong I'll still

368.68 --> 373.68
just kind of leave it there right unless

371.36 --> 376.56
it's just presented so whiny and

373.68 --> 378.599
everything but I don't want them part of

376.56 --> 380.88
my discussion I don't want them in my

378.599 --> 380.88
live

382.28 --> 388.4
show anyway hello lumpy gas in the

385.199 --> 391.40000000000003
vacuum and slow mo moon

388.4 --> 391.4
buggy

391.91 --> 394.999
[Music]

407.0 --> 410.84
what it is I just don't feel exactly

409.28 --> 413.44
great

410.84 --> 415.75899999999996
today I mean I don't feel crank I just

413.44 --> 418.4
feel a bit nauseous

415.759 --> 420.879
weird can't really pinpoint

418.4 --> 423.0
it

420.879 --> 425.59900000000005
although maybe it's the the chocolate

423.0 --> 430.479
stuff because I got another box of

425.599 --> 433.599
the like from the supermarket bonus box

430.479 --> 433.599
there was some chocolate in

437.84 --> 443.35999999999996
it so I think I might be maybe a bit

440.879 --> 446.319
sickish from that because I'm not used

443.36 --> 447.84000000000003
to Chocolate anymore even just for the

446.319 --> 451.319
sugar that is in

447.84 --> 451.31899999999996
it h

457.479 --> 462.87899999999996
let's see what was going on yesterday

460.08 --> 462.87899999999996
beside my own

468.599 --> 474.24
show ploid had a rising upward

472.639 --> 477.479
earther

474.24 --> 477.479
on his

478.319 --> 481.319
show

482.319 --> 488.44
oh yeah yeah Quantum of conscious had a

484.36 --> 492.96000000000004
interesting video about the Indian moon

488.44 --> 495.52
landing is very funny I mean like yeah

492.96 --> 497.87899999999996
check that out cuz it's not like a

495.52 --> 501.159
typical flat earther review or whatever

497.879 --> 503.40000000000003
so it's like one of his and and that's

501.159 --> 505.639
like much more psychological oriented

503.4 --> 505.63899999999995
very

505.84 --> 511.23999999999995
interesting I mean I have him in my

508.039 --> 511.24
favorite channels for a reason

515.44 --> 519.0390000000001
right other than that there wasn't too

516.959 --> 522.3599999999999
much going on I just watched more lock

519.039 --> 526.24
and key it's a really good series even

522.36 --> 526.24
the second season is just

534.0 --> 541.2
intense and by the way I totally called

537.32 --> 541.2
it about the keys

541.24 --> 547.2
what I thought even at at like end of

543.8 --> 550.12
season one is like uh those bullets

547.2 --> 552.6800000000001
things those are the keys and guess what

550.12 --> 554.88
they make keys out of them in this

552.68 --> 558.0
season

554.88 --> 560.079
so yeah totally called it it's almost

558.0 --> 563.04
like like I could have written that

560.079 --> 565.959
story or something the story

563.04 --> 568.12
structure n it's not it feels like it

565.959 --> 569.8389999999999
it's

568.12 --> 572.8
weird

569.839 --> 576.2
like it's a very well-written

572.8 --> 579.56
story and the characters are interesting

576.2 --> 579.5600000000001
and developing

580.04 --> 583.04
interestingly

597.959 --> 602.92
anyway oh hell dank good to see you

600.56 --> 602.92
hello

622.959 --> 627.3599999999999
fruit pis movies

627.8 --> 633.04
no I don't think I well maybe I don't

633.76 --> 637.8389999999999
know what are some of his

651.519 --> 656.9590000000001
movies get out probably most famous One

655.76 --> 659.8389999999999
get

656.959 --> 663.2399999999999
out I think I have heard of that I don't

659.839 --> 663.24
think I've seen that I'm not

666.56 --> 670.3199999999999
sure maybe I've seen

687.72 --> 693.279
it right also I got creepy detail

691.639 --> 697.2
memories that I'm mostly going to keep

693.279 --> 699.48
to myself about actually like in the

697.2 --> 699.48
Dark

699.519 --> 705.44
World

701.16 --> 708.8389999999999
him showing me or basically grafting me

705.44 --> 708.839
into the series it's

711.04 --> 719.639
like like apparently the devil that I

715.24 --> 723.16
met in there really liked the devil the

719.639 --> 725.44
possessions the possessed figures in the

723.16 --> 727.8
series that become possessed by that he

725.44 --> 732.24
really liked that and he wanted to

727.8 --> 734.639
like put me in that role he always did

732.24 --> 736.36
that so [ __ ]

734.639 --> 739.24
up

736.36 --> 741.92
so cuz he would do that with like every

739.24 --> 744.399
[ __ ] movie ever like every movie I've

741.92 --> 747.7199999999999
ever seen like the devil in that Dark

744.399 --> 750.399
World Experience like showed me those

747.72 --> 752.48
things from the future

750.399 --> 755.199
that I have no idea like from when or

752.48 --> 758.36
where that even was except that like it

755.199 --> 759.8389999999999
became obvious that it was a like a

758.36 --> 763.32
theatrical

759.839 --> 766.8800000000001
production and then he put me in the

763.32 --> 770.44
evil role every [ __ ] time I'm so sick

766.88 --> 772.92
of that [ __ ] devil thing I hate

770.44 --> 776.1990000000001
it and then nothing I could do against

772.92 --> 776.199
it though was literally

777.839 --> 782.36
invulnerable

779.8 --> 785.56
but it's kind of weird to just like more

782.36 --> 787.8000000000001
concretely remember not just the series

785.56 --> 791.76
but like the ex

787.8 --> 795.079
the yeah the holographic experience Hol

791.76 --> 798.079
deck type experience being subjected to

795.079 --> 802.16
it by well the devil let's just call him

798.079 --> 802.16
that I don't know what else he

802.24 --> 808.0790000000001
is it's no good like everything about

804.959 --> 810.76
him was always Pure Evil and sadism and

808.079 --> 810.76
all that

811.32 --> 816.0400000000001
I mean not even as close as to like

814.839 --> 820.0790000000001
being

816.04 --> 823.959
entertaining or charming or whatever as

820.079 --> 827.3599999999999
as TV or writers like the devil to be

823.959 --> 832.04
portrayed as you know no he was

827.36 --> 834.0
just pure nasty and pure sadism like

832.04 --> 837.48
nothing else about

834.0 --> 840.759
it was just

837.48 --> 840.759
that he

845.68 --> 851.079
but

846.88 --> 851.079
uh maybe that's what got me

854.72 --> 860.24
upset it's like every time I do like

857.56 --> 862.079
flash have flashback memory to like a

860.24 --> 867.6800000000001
dark World Vision

862.079 --> 870.68
part it's it's usually bad on

867.68 --> 870.68
me

873.88 --> 879.24
what

875.92 --> 879.24
what oh

880.12 --> 886.9590000000001
[ __ ] how the hell did he get there see

883.88 --> 886.959
how the hell did he get on a

896.399 --> 900.68
respirator [ __ ]

910.92 --> 914.8
yeah I hope things work out too

927.6 --> 935.6
Jesus but seriously though how the hell

930.72 --> 935.6
did he like on a respirator why what

940.0 --> 943.16
happened maybe you don't want to talk

941.92 --> 946.56
about never

943.16 --> 949.079
mind anyway yeah that's tough jesz

946.56 --> 951.3599999999999
yesterday I guess was all kinds of crap

949.079 --> 951.3599999999999
in the

953.88 --> 959.16
air Darkness was apparently going around

957.16 --> 961.319
seeking damage

959.16 --> 964.759
seeking to do damage or something it

961.319 --> 964.759
really does feel like that

975.24 --> 981.04
sometimes then a ventilate right yeah I

978.72 --> 982.9590000000001
I thought I was wondering like isn't

981.04 --> 985.56
that like a a ventil but it's not the

982.959 --> 987.5189999999999
same thing because yeah ventilators are

985.56 --> 989.7589999999999
like used to

987.519 --> 994.88
basically

989.759 --> 994.88
to freaking kill Co patients

995.759 --> 1001.1990000000001
basically trouble breathing flu in

1010.68 --> 1016.8
lungs yeah SL moon buggy I bet it did

1014.88 --> 1021.68
terrible

1016.8 --> 1021.68
[ __ ] I mean a lot of lot of people were

1022.48 --> 1028.079
effectively like through the system

1025.48 --> 1033.439
murdered with all the ventilator stuff

1028.079 --> 1033.4389999999999
when was it around 2020 a lot of

1033.76 --> 1040.039
people was probably the biggest

1040.199 --> 1045.959
organized medical mass murders that the

1043.28 --> 1045.959
world has ever

1047.0 --> 1054.6
seen there were so many people subjected

1050.12 --> 1056.6399999999999
to that it was like none of them have

1054.6 --> 1059.0
actually survived the

1056.64 --> 1062.039
procedure anybody that was put on a

1059.0 --> 1064.08
ventilator they all died no exception I

1062.039 --> 1066.72
think I don't think anybody actually

1064.08 --> 1066.72
survived

1077.4 --> 1080.4
that

1120.6 --> 1124.48
right yeah I personally by the way don't

1123.0 --> 1129.12
know anybody that

1124.48 --> 1134.28
was kill that way you could say

1129.12 --> 1134.28
that oh my family they all died before

1137.32 --> 1142.6
that the ones that were at risk you

1140.36 --> 1142.6
could

1159.799 --> 1165.52
say right so but now you know it's like

1163.36 --> 1167.12
oh oh oh I'm so scared for my loved one

1165.52 --> 1169.679
yeah yeah if you bring them if they have

1167.12 --> 1175.36
trouble breathing and you bring them to

1169.679 --> 1178.44
a hospital during times of Co related

1175.36 --> 1182.6399999999999
stuff you'll literally murder them it's

1178.44 --> 1187.3200000000002
like no at this point I would literally

1182.64 --> 1189.76
risk having somebody just painfully

1187.32 --> 1192.52
choke rather than bring them to a

1189.76 --> 1195.4
hospital at this point it's

1192.52 --> 1197.12
like no you have a better chance just

1195.4 --> 1198.919
sit trying to sit through there even

1197.12 --> 1201.4399999999998
though it's really [ __ ] painful like

1198.919 --> 1205.2800000000002
a massive asthma attack or something

1201.44 --> 1209.559
right very stressful sure but at least

1205.28 --> 1209.559
you have a chance of surviving

1225.64 --> 1232.1200000000001

that you see

1775.039 --> 1781.1589999999999
that but

1777.84 --> 1784.48
uh yeah it's already healed

1781.159 --> 1785.88
up man my mint plant is just rocking it

1784.48 --> 1789.84
by the

1785.88 --> 1792.8400000000001

1817.84 --> 1823.279
grown or

1820.18 --> 1823.279
[Music]

1825.36 --> 1829.8799999999999
what guys remember me showing you

1833.76 --> 1840.039
this it's bigger

1837.44 --> 1842.799
right I mean this used to be a pretty

1840.039 --> 1845.559
small potted

1842.799 --> 1848.08
plant well the pot's really freaking big

1845.559 --> 1851.559
but the plant was

1848.08 --> 1853.6789999999999
like this big al together and now it's

1851.559 --> 1858.44
like

1853.679 --> 1861.3200000000002
poof like it's full of shoots completely

1858.44 --> 1861.3200000000002
exploding with

1861.76 --> 1867.76
shoes Mr Green th it's just a mint

1869.039 --> 1875.279
plant and it's like by the way it's

1871.24 --> 1878.72
having like all these uh what is it side

1875.279 --> 1881.559
Grapplers like little root shoots where

1878.72 --> 1883.24
they basically start digging for like

1881.559 --> 1886.8799999999999
strawberries have them

1883.24 --> 1890.88
too it's full of them so this thing is

1886.88 --> 1890.88
going to probably really

1891.2 --> 1898.24
explode with mint plants in a in a few

1895.039 --> 1898.24
weeks I

1901.279 --> 1907.36
think but yeah it's definitely feeling

1904.76 --> 1910.799
uh it's feeling

1907.36 --> 1914.08
good bit unlike my parsley plant I think

1910.799 --> 1917.679
that some kind of fungus typical fungus

1914.08 --> 1921.08
has infected The Parsley plant because

1917.679 --> 1924.279
it's just getting covered in

1921.08 --> 1927.039
like pale

1924.279 --> 1929.399
dust it's getting weak unfortunately I

1927.039 --> 1932.279
don't know what to do about

1929.399 --> 1934.799
it all right anyway but the mint plant

1932.279 --> 1934.799
is doing

1934.84 --> 1938.24
great check it

1946.08 --> 1949.08
out

1951.24 --> 1959.71
[Music]

1965.24 --> 1969.0
and the fun thing is too is that I'm

1967.2 --> 1971.919
pretty sure the mint plant will make it

1969.0 --> 1971.919
through the winter as

1971.96 --> 1979.0
well because it's basically a weed and

1974.84 --> 1981.399
it's not going to die

1979.0 --> 1983.919
so it's going to be the plant that I'm

1981.399 --> 1986.0
going to keep on my balcony for as long

1983.919 --> 1987.88
as it's possible just to see how well it

1986.0 --> 1990.039
will

1987.88 --> 1992.519
do and then maybe I'm going to

1990.039 --> 1994.48
completely reassess my original idea

1992.519 --> 1997.559
about keeping plants on the balcony

1994.48 --> 2000.2
which I was very restrained about

1997.559 --> 2002.48
because well mostly because of wind I

2000.2 --> 2004.8400000000001
mean it was pretty hazardous with the

2002.48 --> 2007.679
even with the wind now it's been quite a

2004.84 --> 2012.0
hassle have to like put the lands in

2007.679 --> 2012.0
between the railing so they don't blow

2013.72 --> 2019.76
away

2016.32 --> 2023.2
right but yeah it's been very

2019.76 --> 2025.639
entertaining and nice to have some

2023.2 --> 2028.519
plants like next to me not just

2025.639 --> 2028.519
downstairs in the

2031.72 --> 2034.96
kitchen hey

2035.96 --> 2038.96
kumus

2042.72 --> 2046.519

2049.24 --> 2053.839
night well it would be a late no he

2051.599 --> 2057.159
wouldn't have been it wouldn't be a late

2053.839 --> 2057.159
night because then he would be

2064.919 --> 2069.2
here anyway good see you team

2075.24 --> 2083.24
traveler what do I think is above our

2078.2 --> 2083.24
heads heavy metal ruined my life

2086.079 --> 2090.8790000000004
1971 what is above our

2088.399 --> 2093.72
heads

2090.879 --> 2097.64
sky

2093.72 --> 2100.9199999999996
and the end of this

2097.64 --> 2100.92
guy some

2120.359 --> 2124.359
point come on you don't want to know

2123.359 --> 2128.7999999999997
about

2124.359 --> 2128.7999999999997
that thanks

2160.839 --> 2165.7599999999998
right yeah what do you think good

2168.96 --> 2174.359
point I mean yeah I could say like yeah

2171.839 --> 2177.4
I think it's probably a flat top that's

2174.359 --> 2177.4
what I think

2185.72 --> 2188.72
hair

2190.599 --> 2196.48
the throne room

2192.76 --> 2199.2000000000003
of oh right CU you got is of course a

2196.48 --> 2199.2
physical

2200.2 --> 2203.359
being is

2215.68 --> 2218.68
it

2218.76 --> 2223.92
now I don't think well I understand

2220.96 --> 2227.48
you'd say that I don't think the throne

2223.92 --> 2231.28
room of God is a physical actual

2227.48 --> 2235.2
thing CU that's not

2231.28 --> 2238.079
relevant to the physical

2235.2 --> 2242.4399999999996
existence pretty sure there's probably

2238.079 --> 2242.44
in the in the spirit realm a throne of

2242.48 --> 2249.8
God

2244.359 --> 2249.7999999999997
but was no reason for to be exist

2255.44 --> 2261.0
physically it is physical yeah the King

2258.48 --> 2265.52
James Bible oh yes of

2261.0 --> 2268.92
course well that's the ultimate

2265.52 --> 2272.56
Arbiter Mr poofy

2268.92 --> 2272.56
pants he knows

2275.599 --> 2278.599
best

2285.079 --> 2291.48
Com or holes in oh

2288.48 --> 2291.48
God

2293.48 --> 2299.44
what doorway what doorways you can't

2296.839 --> 2301.48
have pressure without a container

2299.44 --> 2305.52
there's no

2301.48 --> 2308.52
doorways no physical doorways

2305.52 --> 2308.52
anyway

2315.319 --> 2320.52
I mean it's sounds Fantastical and all

2317.599 --> 2323.599
that but it also sounds very non

2320.52 --> 2327.52
literally nonliteral like

2323.599 --> 2327.52
non-physical that's what it sounds

2332.68 --> 2339.48
like right and since well since the

2336.92 --> 2340.92
Celestial landscape we get to see up

2339.48 --> 2346.079
there

2340.92 --> 2348.8
moves including any comets that might be

2346.079 --> 2350.52
visible yeah comets they kind of move

2348.8 --> 2355.8390000000004
like

2350.52 --> 2358.88
planets or just move with the overall

2355.839 --> 2361.68
background it's moving so that means not

2358.88 --> 2365.7200000000003
a physical doorway

2361.68 --> 2368.5989999999997
then yeah there a physical doorway is

2365.72 --> 2372.319
not going to move move over the

2368.599 --> 2372.319
container that makes no

2377.119 --> 2383.599
sense a SE glass what the [ __ ] is a SE

2386.76 --> 2395.4
glass it can't just be pieces of

2390.76 --> 2398.4
glass it has to be a closed sealed

2395.4 --> 2398.4
container

2398.599 --> 2405.2000000000003
or simply no there not existing any more

2401.76 --> 2407.6800000000003
volume for matter to to maneuver into

2405.2 --> 2410.2799999999997
right then it doesn't really matter but

2407.68 --> 2414.2799999999997
that would automatically exclude there

2410.28 --> 2416.92
from being any more room Beyond it so no

2414.28 --> 2416.92
doorway

2425.359 --> 2428.359
then

2428.72 --> 2433.48
what spent okay that's cool dude you

2431.319 --> 2437.0
seem to believe a lot of things and hey

2433.48 --> 2439.64
I have had my ideas about them too

2437.0 --> 2441.48
supposed Waters above yeah they might

2439.64 --> 2446.52
have been used during the flood like

2441.48 --> 2449.119
that's the toilet flush that flushed out

2446.52 --> 2451.48
Atlantis and now the water

2449.119 --> 2453.6800000000003
is

2451.48 --> 2456.8
down through the

2453.68 --> 2459.359
drain and maybe it's filling back up

2456.8 --> 2461.1600000000003
just like a toilet I don't know maybe

2459.359 --> 2463.16
God has a toilet

2461.16 --> 2466.7599999999998
system for

2463.16 --> 2469.359
Earth and if things get too

2466.76 --> 2473.2400000000002
shitty then he

2469.359 --> 2476.0789999999997
just great flood I mean yeah sounds kind

2473.24 --> 2477.64
of funny but it might also be quite

2476.079 --> 2480.3590000000004
literally

2477.64 --> 2482.04
true God may have designed the realm

2480.359 --> 2485.24
like a giant toilet

2482.04 --> 2487.44
system to flush us out if we get too

2485.24 --> 2490.7599999999998
shitty

2487.44 --> 2490.76
and yes pun

2505.28 --> 2508.28
intended

2509.4 --> 2517.92
right but I mean just might be this our

2514.28 --> 2520.92
way out okay yeah

2517.92 --> 2520.92
yeah

2523.72 --> 2527.56
no what do you mean way

2537.119 --> 2540.8
out way out to

2545.16 --> 2548.16
what

2564.88 --> 2570.359
yeah I know I get that heavy metal ruin

2567.16 --> 2573.5589999999997
my life yeah God or

2570.359 --> 2574.7599999999998
Jesus separate things yeah they do say

2573.559 --> 2577.7200000000003
things

2574.76 --> 2580.4
sometimes and yeah I can definitely say

2577.72 --> 2583.64
like oh yeah sure that's the word of God

2580.4 --> 2586.359
it must be true I get it does that mean

2583.64 --> 2591.2799999999997
you fully [ __ ] understand what it

2586.359 --> 2594.7999999999997
means though oh oh well it you can

2591.28 --> 2597.3190000000004
derive an explanation based on some

2594.8 --> 2599.2000000000003
self-constructed preconceived model of

2597.319 --> 2602.48
what he could be talking about and then

2599.2 --> 2604.04
compare that oh

2602.48 --> 2607.44
okay

2604.04 --> 2610.64
well ever considered that it means a

2607.44 --> 2614.96
whole giant world of other things on

2610.64 --> 2617.96
which that entire lingo is even based of

2614.96 --> 2622.4
which you are completely left out of the

2617.96 --> 2625.2
loop by God and Jesus as in they're not

2622.4 --> 2629.0
telling you they're not giving you

2625.2 --> 2631.24
fullon intro instructions how to

2629.0 --> 2633.96
understand the esoterics of what they're

2631.24 --> 2638.0789999999997
saying could it

2633.96 --> 2638.079
be could it be

2638.24 --> 2642.7599999999998
that

2639.359 --> 2646.64
oh you can only come to to the father

2642.76 --> 2650.6800000000003
through me could it be that it has a bit

2646.64 --> 2653.359
more complicated esoteric meaning to it

2650.68 --> 2657.9199999999996
and it doesn't mean oh no that means

2653.359 --> 2661.0
that I am God I am my father and I am my

2657.92 --> 2664.079
son I am the same yeah oh no that means

2661.0 --> 2666.96
that of course yes cuz that's the logic

2664.079 --> 2669.88
we got out of it because we're going to

2666.96 --> 2674.079
assume that everything that was given to

2669.88 --> 2676.4
us in speech is all all there is like

2674.079 --> 2678.319
that means there's nothing more that you

2676.4 --> 2679.839
need to know to understand that we're

2678.319 --> 2682.319
going to just assume that whatever I

2679.839 --> 2685.44
said it's just all

2682.319 --> 2688.68
self-contained so let's get literal and

2685.44 --> 2688.68
nonsensical about

2694.96 --> 2697.96
it

2701.04 --> 2706.68
this life is a litmus yeah it is that's

2703.559 --> 2711.4
right it is a litmus test it's a litmus

2706.68 --> 2716.44
test will you surrender to delusion for

2711.4 --> 2716.44
good feeling yeah that's the litmus

2717.079 --> 2724.6400000000003
test will you give into peer pressure

2720.16 --> 2727.04
and chant absolute provable hor [ __ ]

2724.64 --> 2730.839
because it makes you feel good

2727.04 --> 2735.319
good or will you

2730.839 --> 2739.4
suffer for holding on everybody goes

2735.319 --> 2741.96
against you for holding on to Pure logic

2739.4 --> 2746.0
like the thing that you can definitely

2741.96 --> 2748.76
prove and argue is created by God

2746.0 --> 2752.72
literally are you going to use the

2748.76 --> 2755.88
proven tools given to you by God or are

2752.72 --> 2759.04
you going to trade it in I just feel

2755.88 --> 2760.8
feeling good with the rest of the guys

2759.04 --> 2763.839
with your [ __ ] delusion that are

2760.8 --> 2767.8390000000004
provable delusion yeah yeah that's the

2763.839 --> 2767.839
[ __ ] litmus test

2780.49 --> 2788.8799999999997
[Music]

2784.04 --> 2788.88
yeah does a billion really have true

2789.359 --> 2795.72
friends who

2791.72 --> 2795.72
cares is their [ __ ]

2811.319 --> 2817.48
problem first thing a true friend would

2813.96 --> 2818.64
do is tell them yeah give up on the

2817.48 --> 2820.52
[ __ ]

2818.64 --> 2825.44
money give it

2820.52 --> 2828.4
up how can't like how look how can

2825.44 --> 2832.76
somebody even be friends with a

2828.4 --> 2832.76
billionaire like that tell

2833.599 --> 2839.04
me I mean it's it's [ __ ] guys

2836.68 --> 2840.96
billionaires don't have friends

2839.04 --> 2843.68
everybody is a commodity to a

2840.96 --> 2846.599
billionaire

2843.68 --> 2850.5989999999997
everybody prove me wrong

2846.599 --> 2852.6400000000003
prove me wrong and prove that

2850.599 --> 2854.7200000000003
billionaires have friends and it's not

2852.64 --> 2857.7599999999998
just Commodities to

2854.72 --> 2860.64
them CU I've never seen

2857.76 --> 2864.0400000000004
that when you have that much money you

2860.64 --> 2865.16
you don't have friends or natural

2864.04 --> 2868.599
contact

2865.16 --> 2868.5989999999997
anymore doesn't

2873.2 --> 2879.68
exist only thing you that's left is

2876.839 --> 2882.2
servants and parasites that's all you

2879.68 --> 2885.96
ever get when you're a

2882.2 --> 2885.96
billionaire servants and

2902.48 --> 2907.119
parasites you never met a billy there in

2904.96 --> 2909.64
real life well you didn't miss anything

2907.119 --> 2909.6400000000003
steamy

2913.28 --> 2918.119
traveler first thing that'll know that

2915.599 --> 2920.04
will stand out to you is about how they

2918.119 --> 2922.1600000000003
don't have a life and they just seem to

2920.04 --> 2924.72
be posing most of the

2922.16 --> 2928.04
time they

2924.72 --> 2930.64
they natural form of being and human

2928.04 --> 2934.599
expression leaves

2930.64 --> 2937.64
them you can't have that and be a

2934.599 --> 2940.6800000000003
billionaire just doesn't

2937.64 --> 2944.2799999999997
work it's stripped away from you yeah

2940.68 --> 2947.2799999999997
money takes everything from you

2944.28 --> 2951.92
everything all of

2947.28 --> 2956.0400000000004
it all your spirit and all you got left

2951.92 --> 2959.6800000000003
is just a bunch of stuff

2956.04 --> 2959.68
junk it's all the

2961.559 --> 2967.52
same it's just a bunch of stuff to

2964.079 --> 2967.52
distract you

2967.599 --> 2974.96
distract you from how your senses have

2970.92 --> 2977.6800000000003
left you because they don't work

2974.96 --> 2981.319
anymore

2977.68 --> 2984.72
yeah no I'd rather be really freaking

2981.319 --> 2987.079
poor and just be able to enjoy looking

2984.72 --> 2987.0789999999997
at a

2994.52 --> 2997.52
tree

3008.319 --> 3013.599
lowly millionaires well millionaires is

3010.44 --> 3016.52
fine I mean millionaire is just middle

3013.599 --> 3019.599
class people that are millionaires

3016.52 --> 3019.599
they're just really

3020.799 --> 3026.2
busy like as a billionaire you're not

3023.68 --> 3029.44
really busy anymore You' got other

3026.2 --> 3032.359
people to be busy for

3029.44 --> 3033.68
you mostly otherwise you're not going to

3032.359 --> 3035.16
be a billionaire but if you're a

3033.68 --> 3038.64
millionaire you're just going to be very

3035.16 --> 3040.04
busy doesn't necessarily mean I mean you

3038.64 --> 3043.319
can't

3040.04 --> 3045.64
be a very healthy spiritually healthy

3043.319 --> 3047.2799999999997
millionaire that's very doable

3045.64 --> 3051.16
billionaire

3047.28 --> 3051.1600000000003
no that's not going to work

3054.44 --> 3057.44
anymore

3057.48 --> 3063.599
right because millionaires aren't Rich

3059.76 --> 3066.6400000000003
enough to to attract only

3063.599 --> 3069.28
parasites that's the difference it's a

3066.64 --> 3070.96
billionaire you can be responsible for a

3069.28 --> 3074.2000000000003
whole bunch of people and like form a

3070.96 --> 3077.2400000000002
community with them you can be like the

3074.2 --> 3079.4399999999996
the local Banker type not even literally

3077.24 --> 3081.24
a banker but just like function because

3079.44 --> 3084.4
of the money and because of your

3081.24 --> 3087.359
business right so you'll be very

3084.4 --> 3087.359
connected

3088.599 --> 3091.96
millionaires can definitely have

3110.599 --> 3117.2000000000003
souls right so yeah see it like this

3115.0 --> 3119.28
near billionaires end up protecting

3117.2 --> 3121.8799999999997
communities and people and

3119.28 --> 3123.44
families billionaires

3121.88 --> 3128.48
often

3123.44 --> 3130.52
like just destroy entire

3128.48 --> 3135.0
communities and

3130.52 --> 3138.48
just Harvest them basically for money

3135.0 --> 3138.48
that's what billionaires that's the

3144.28 --> 3147.28
difference

3147.559 --> 3154.079
I mean I have no direct proof of it but

3151.2 --> 3158.0789999999997
if you're a billionaire then the chances

3154.079 --> 3160.92
of you not being involved in some kind

3158.079 --> 3163.6800000000003
of Industrial Level

3160.92 --> 3168.64
murder of whatever it

3163.68 --> 3171.52
is like babies Wildlife nature some

3168.64 --> 3173.5589999999997
massive scale murder then you're yeah

3171.52 --> 3176.319
that's you're going to be involved in

3173.559 --> 3180.8390000000004
that if you have that much money

3176.319 --> 3183.68
like you can't get away from that more

3180.839 --> 3186.64
money you get the more gruesome things

3183.68 --> 3189.1189999999997
you have to do to keep

3186.64 --> 3192.24
it the more of your soul you have to

3189.119 --> 3192.2400000000002
surrender to keep

3201.96 --> 3208.92
it right and other people also like they

3205.96 --> 3211.28
won't want you to have it like people

3208.92 --> 3213.76
don't want you to have anything anymore

3211.28 --> 3216.8390000000004
because you're a [ __ ] stinky rich

3213.76 --> 3218.7200000000003
person so people are going to even like

3216.839 --> 3221.799
demand things from

3218.72 --> 3224.799
you to even do business with

3221.799 --> 3224.799
you

3231.72 --> 3237.04
right unless you just have power over

3234.48 --> 3239.44
them

3237.04 --> 3241.92
as a billionaire it's like oh yeah but I

3239.44 --> 3244.04
own your town so I can literally just

3241.92 --> 3246.04
give the order and then it's just shut

3244.04 --> 3247.599
down and then it's like your town is

3246.04 --> 3250.4
going to go bust because suddenly

3247.599 --> 3251.799
there's a blockade that I managed to

3250.4 --> 3255.28
legally

3251.799 --> 3258.7599999999998
impose through my

3255.28 --> 3258.76
power that sort of

3263.2 --> 3269.96
[ __ ] like millionaire can have pretty

3266.16 --> 3272.64
good contacts contacts like even in

3269.96 --> 3276.52
police and all that billionaires tend to

3272.64 --> 3280.68
like buy up entire police

3276.52 --> 3280.68
stations for their

3281.0 --> 3285.48
ployes for for their

3294.079 --> 3297.079
tricks

3302.559 --> 3305.559
anyway

3305.92 --> 3310.28
yeah so yeah let me say something that's

3308.52 --> 3311.92
going to kind of weird you out and I bet

3310.28 --> 3315.2400000000002
there's going to be a massive gamma

3311.92 --> 3318.559
squirt Fest over it out there if even

3315.24 --> 3320.1189999999997
reaches anybody but uh

3318.559 --> 3321.799
yeah

3320.119 --> 3326.2000000000003
only

3321.799 --> 3329.0
losers aspire to be billionaire

3326.2 --> 3329.0
only

3329.4 --> 3332.4
losers

3339.48 --> 3345.64
fact they're all

3342.24 --> 3348.24
losers they're all broken

3345.64 --> 3350.5989999999997
losers the thing is you have to be

3348.24 --> 3353.52
broken when you started to even be

3350.599 --> 3356.1600000000003
stupid enough to choose to live like

3353.52 --> 3358.799
that to become that

3356.16 --> 3363.0789999999997
you have to be broken from the start to

3358.799 --> 3366.48
be able to fall for that Satan

3363.079 --> 3369.8390000000004
trap cuz if you're not weak enough when

3366.48 --> 3371.76
you're young you figure it out that

3369.839 --> 3374.52
being a billionaire is like the last

3371.76 --> 3374.5200000000004
thing you'd ever

3375.359 --> 3383.92
want so you'd have to be a

3379.76 --> 3386.92
loser in order to become a billionaire

3383.92 --> 3386.92
fact

3389.44 --> 3393.88
then why am here begging for yes yes

3391.799 --> 3397.68
because it's exactly the opposite of a

3393.88 --> 3400.4
billionaire I'd rather be begging for

3397.68 --> 3405.2799999999997
scraps every

3400.4 --> 3408.28
day for a million years than be a

3405.28 --> 3412.2000000000003
billionaire like this like what it is

3408.28 --> 3416.079
now I mean yeah I could probably find a

3412.2 --> 3419.9199999999996
purpose for money like that

3416.079 --> 3422.0
but only because I'm not just going to

3419.92 --> 3424.2400000000002
be concerned about having that much

3422.0 --> 3426.24
money I like what do I want to

3424.24 --> 3429.1189999999997
accomplish that's going to cost

3426.24 --> 3431.5989999999997
billions and then that is the project

3429.119 --> 3433.92
that is the money it's the project like

3431.599 --> 3436.44
the money itself I don't give a

3433.92 --> 3439.119
[ __ ] like money

3436.44 --> 3442.0
disintegrates it just goes

3439.119 --> 3443.76
away and if you try to prevent that well

3442.0 --> 3445.64
then you have to like Slaughter

3443.76 --> 3447.5200000000004
everything to do that

3445.64 --> 3451.0789999999997
that's what makes you so [ __ ] up and

3447.52 --> 3451.079
evil and

3451.72 --> 3456.68
drained just going to give up everything

3454.599 --> 3459.3590000000004
just to maintain the money well I'm not

3456.68 --> 3462.2799999999997
going to do that but I might be able to

3459.359 --> 3465.88
find out ways how to spend

3462.28 --> 3469.0
billions on big projects could defin

3465.88 --> 3473.28
I've already got several ideas one of

3469.0 --> 3476.28
them being remember the space launch

3473.28 --> 3479.3190000000004
emulator tunnel freef fall tunnel where

3476.28 --> 3482.52
you can have like zero g emulation like

3479.319 --> 3484.72
the best quality that will ever exist

3482.52 --> 3486.24
for several minutes

3484.72 --> 3490.359
straight

3486.24 --> 3492.5989999999997
minutes perfect Z emulation

3490.359 --> 3495.44
physically yeah that's probably going to

3492.599 --> 3499.799
cost a billion if not several to have

3495.44 --> 3503.559
that all like literally dug out of a

3499.799 --> 3505.64
mountain a giant tunnel diagonal tunnels

3503.559 --> 3507.119
through a mountain

3505.64 --> 3510.24
okay it's going to be a freaking

3507.119 --> 3514.039
expensive project yeah so but I

3510.24 --> 3518.4399999999996
can imagine things to that I would

3514.039 --> 3521.3190000000004
require like a billion dollars for to do

3518.44 --> 3523.88
that but I don't want to be a

3521.319 --> 3526.2799999999997
billionaire I just would I would love to

3523.88 --> 3530.2400000000002
have gigantic projects to do or

3526.28 --> 3530.2400000000002
something or to organize that would be

3533.72 --> 3538.9199999999996
cool

3535.92 --> 3543.28
what if I become very wealthy by

3538.92 --> 3543.28
accident well accidents can

3546.52 --> 3550.64
happen so what you're going to do with

3552.839 --> 3558.359
it

3555.48 --> 3563.52
right the point is you can have a lot of

3558.359 --> 3566.319
wealth and then the wealth will start to

3563.52 --> 3568.4
slowly go away

3566.319 --> 3572.599
that's

3568.4 --> 3576.319
it that's what happens unless you like

3572.599 --> 3578.96
decide I am going to hold on to this

3576.319 --> 3582.0
level of money well then you're going to

3578.96 --> 3585.2
have to change everything around and

3582.0 --> 3587.96
reorganize your life to be able

3585.2 --> 3591.2799999999997
to ensure that that money is going to

3587.96 --> 3594.039
stay at that level and now you are

3591.28 --> 3595.3590000000004
actively a person of that money like a

3594.039 --> 3599.0
millionaire or

3595.359 --> 3603.0789999999997
billionaire but a millionaire is very

3599.0 --> 3604.96
doable you can just be business owner

3603.079 --> 3607.1600000000003
you can have so much things you can do

3604.96 --> 3607.16
with

3607.96 --> 3614.2
that and create products put them on the

3610.799 --> 3614.2
market all that sort of

3615.16 --> 3623.5589999999997
thing don't I would ever be I don't I

3620.839 --> 3628.2
would ever be able to hold on to

3623.559 --> 3631.96
wealth right well you could do it if you

3628.2 --> 3631.96
just invest everything in Bill

3632.039 --> 3640.079
Gates or an the other the next most evil

3637.76 --> 3643.2000000000003
person you could ever

3640.079 --> 3646.6400000000003
imagine yeah if you invest everything

3643.2 --> 3649.96
there then you'll be able to maintain

3646.64 --> 3652.92
your money level just give all your

3649.96 --> 3655.16
money to the most evil person you could

3652.92 --> 3658.359
possibly imagine

3655.16 --> 3662.92
and then you can keep

3658.359 --> 3662.92
it yeah that's how this [ __ ] world

3667.079 --> 3671.4
Works

3668.839 --> 3674.4
money and more

3671.4 --> 3678.599
money the only thing you can do with it

3674.4 --> 3680.599
is just create evil and maintain evil so

3678.599 --> 3683.44
is the evil things that have all the

3680.599 --> 3686.44
money for a

3683.44 --> 3686.44
reason

3691.76 --> 3695.7090000000003
right

3692.65 --> 3695.7090000000003
[Music]

3697.48 --> 3702.559
anyway every one of my neighbors is a

3700.119 --> 3705.319
Millionaire

3702.559 --> 3708.3190000000004

3705.319 --> 3713.0389999999998
awesome as I said millionaires are

3708.319 --> 3713.0389999999998
great billionaires are completely

3713.44 --> 3719.16
[ __ ]

3715.68 --> 3722.9199999999996
millionaires create businesses create

3719.16 --> 3726.52
communities often create like just

3722.92 --> 3730.0
wealth middle class family that's a

3726.52 --> 3733.2
millionaire a billionaire is completely

3730.0 --> 3734.68
[ __ ] they're often mentally deranged

3733.2 --> 3737.8799999999997
sexually

3734.68 --> 3740.9199999999996
perverted unnatural like they don't even

3737.88 --> 3743.359
know like who the [ __ ] they are anymore

3740.92 --> 3746.319
they're they become

3743.359 --> 3748.7599999999998
deranged because you'd have to be

3746.319 --> 3754.119
deranged to even be

3748.76 --> 3754.119
capable of keeping that much

3765.2 --> 3770.9199999999996
money every day see people living in

3768.44 --> 3773.48
hell you want to help them but you can't

3770.92 --> 3775.839
right well a millionaire can and they

3773.48 --> 3779.2400000000002
know how to and they know how to do it

3775.839 --> 3782.119
carefully a billionaire just wants those

3779.24 --> 3784.64
people they see around being in Hell To

3782.119 --> 3784.6400000000003
Die

3786.0 --> 3791.24
quicker yeah so when they say oh I want

3788.88 --> 3793.359
to help all these poor people I just

3791.24 --> 3795.279
want to make sure that nobody's bothered

3793.359 --> 3798.359
by them and they can move on with their

3795.279 --> 3800.359
lives and then oh a year later oh it's

3798.359 --> 3803.279
so clean here yeah yeah where are all

3800.359 --> 3806.0
these people yeah we don't know they

3803.279 --> 3809.48
just they're

3806.0 --> 3811.44
gone somebody like somebody collected

3809.48 --> 3813.2400000000002
them with buses and stuff and now we

3811.44 --> 3816.0
just don't know where it's gone just

3813.24 --> 3816.0
like

3817.599 --> 3825.96
yes I'm sure it they're perfectly

3821.279 --> 3825.96
fine and taken care of I'm

3829.76 --> 3834.8390000000004
sure or they've been rolled into like

3833.4 --> 3838.2000000000003
weaponized

3834.839 --> 3840.359
migration programs it's like oh poor

3838.2 --> 3842.8799999999997
people hey if we give you a lot of money

3840.359 --> 3845.88
just do everything we say Okay and like

3842.88 --> 3848.319
go to these protests and these protests

3845.88 --> 3851.2000000000003
so they become part of the horde like an

3848.319 --> 3851.2
antifa like

3852.039 --> 3856.6400000000003
horde basically to give the mega

3854.559 --> 3859.48
corporations the billionaires more power

3856.64 --> 3862.8799999999997
so they'll help people all right but

3859.48 --> 3866.0
only if those people can

3862.88 --> 3868.1600000000003
then help destroy the

3866.0 --> 3870.559
billionaires help destroy the country

3868.16 --> 3870.5589999999997
for the

3873.279 --> 3880.2
billionaires cuz billionaires don't care

3876.64 --> 3882.799
about people they just don't it's

3880.2 --> 3885.24

4478.92 --> 4483.84
over and over and over and over again

4520.0 --> 4524.96

Earth it's presupposed there's no

4524.96 --> 4530.44

4531.0 --> 4537.12
it and with ever I mean

4533.719 --> 4541.56
ever never ever there will never be a

5059.199 --> 5064.5199999999995
whole McDonald's food doesn't rot was in

5063.12 --> 5067.5599999999995
the

5064.52 --> 5070.0
90s where they literally took like a

5067.56 --> 5072.639
hamburger and french fries and then left

5070.0 --> 5075.719
it in a under a

5072.639 --> 5078.1990000000005
glass for like over a

5075.719 --> 5081.0
decade compared to other things and like

5078.199 --> 5084.239
it didn't rot it didn't fungus it didn't

5081.0 --> 5087.719
do anything it looked almost the same

5084.239 --> 5090.0
after 10 years completely [ __ ]

5087.719 --> 5094.119
insane

5090.0 --> 5094.119
yeah I knew that in the '90s

5096.48 --> 5101.28
I haven't eaten at McDonald's since I

5102.28 --> 5108.0
was 12 I

5105.719 --> 5109.119
think and even then I thought it was

5108.0 --> 5111.32
[ __ ]

5109.119 --> 5113.679
disgusting it's just every time it's

5111.32 --> 5116.0
like oh the idea oh I like the idea of

5113.679 --> 5119.84
McDonald's but then oh actually eating

5116.0 --> 5124.28
at McDonald's and you're like oh my God

5119.84 --> 5124.28
why why did I get lured into this

5125.88 --> 5131.04
pretty much I'd eat anywhere else

5128.44 --> 5133.678999999999
anywhere else would be fine compared to

5131.04 --> 5137.719
McDonald's it isn't though but compared

5133.679 --> 5137.719
to McDonald's anywhere else would be

5139.95 --> 5143.16
[Music]

5148.84 --> 5154.28
fine yeah exactly Nathan r

5156.56 --> 5164.4800000000005
Burger King is much

5158.84 --> 5164.4800000000005
better it's less horrendously terrible

5167.32 --> 5173.599999999999
correct it's still not good for you I

5169.84 --> 5173.6
mean that meat is still pretty

5173.92 --> 5180.119
[ __ ] like that's torture

5177.8 --> 5183.4800000000005
meat just so you know and you're going

5180.119 --> 5185.96
to you're going to feel estamine and all

5183.48 --> 5187.718999999999
that in your system you're like oh why

5185.96 --> 5190.719
I'm feeling it yeah that's literally

5187.719 --> 5193.719
because those cows were practically

5190.719 --> 5193.719
tortured

5194.08 --> 5197.96
okay that's what you're

5198.239 --> 5204.5199999999995
feeling like the only thing that even

5200.679 --> 5206.88
makes up with that slightly for me with

5204.52 --> 5209.639
Burger King was that they had so much

5206.88 --> 5212.4800000000005
lattice and tomato and stuff so much

5209.639 --> 5216.52
vegetable stuff with it that made it all

5212.48 --> 5216.5199999999995
right because it usually was kind of

5218.92 --> 5224.88
fresh but I

5221.679 --> 5227.0
mean I'm never eating there again either

5224.88 --> 5228.56
like I'll make a freaking hamburger

5227.0 --> 5232.04
myself all

5228.56 --> 5235.719
organic yeah I mean that is like a

5232.04 --> 5239.44
thousand times better than any fast food

5235.719 --> 5239.44
restaurant you just make it

5239.56 --> 5247.4400000000005
yourself you take bread

5243.76 --> 5251.2390000000005
you take hamburger meat

5247.44 --> 5252.96
organic a bunch of lettuce a tomato some

5251.239 --> 5257.119
onion you

5252.96 --> 5258.92
bake or you yeah you do the hamburger

5257.119 --> 5263.32
with pepper and

5258.92 --> 5266.2390000000005
some salt in

5263.32 --> 5268.32
butter mostly butter and a little no

5266.239 --> 5270.638999999999
wait you can do yeah no I do it in olive

5268.32 --> 5273.799999999999
oil actually works better cuz I also

5270.639 --> 5277.36
then alongside the hamburger fry the

5273.8 --> 5277.360000000001
onions with it with the

5278.44 --> 5284.0
hamburger right and then yeah you

5282.6 --> 5288.6
assemble

5284.0 --> 5291.0
it with lots of different sauces lattice

5288.6 --> 5294.0
tomato baked

5291.0 --> 5294.0
onions

5295.8 --> 5301.1990000000005
uh anything yeah you could potentially

5298.44 --> 5304.839999999999
put pickles on there or something I mean

5301.199 --> 5308.719
nothing beats that that

5304.84 --> 5312.1990000000005
nothing it's a thousand times better and

5308.719 --> 5315.92
more nourishing than any freaking fast

5312.199 --> 5315.919999999999
food hamburger

5322.48 --> 5329.5199999999995

bread yeah man no me and my bread are

5512.76 --> 5516.76
very close I always back my

5518.76 --> 5525.639
bread I mean bread and me are best

5522.56 --> 5528.8
buddies I

5525.639 --> 5531.28
would like never let bread down I always

5528.8 --> 5531.28
got his

5540.679 --> 5543.679
back

5545.0 --> 5550.04
but no I'm not I mean I like the idea of

5548.639 --> 5552.4800000000005
breaking your own

5550.04 --> 5555.32
bread but that's something that I

5552.48 --> 5557.4
definitely leave to the wife like even

5555.32 --> 5560.08
with my ex like she did that a couple of

5557.4 --> 5562.638999999999
times and I'm just like I just don't

5560.08 --> 5562.639
like doing

5564.96 --> 5569.199
this smart ass when

5570.639 --> 5573.639
yeah

5581.119 --> 5586.679
now baking your own bread is pretty

5583.48 --> 5590.04
cool but I mean it is like more for like

5586.679 --> 5592.119
a more Homestead type

5590.04 --> 5594.28
situation there's a lot of work that

5592.119 --> 5599.639
goes into

5594.28 --> 5602.84
it I really really prefer to buy

5599.639 --> 5605.32
my sliced r

5602.84 --> 5608.32
from the organic store it's kind of

5605.32 --> 5609.08
expensive but I don't eat that much of

5608.32 --> 5611.799999999999
it

5609.08 --> 5615.44
anyway I basically eat two slices of

5611.8 --> 5617.88
bread a day sometimes not even for my

5615.44 --> 5620.5199999999995
baked eggs that's it that's the only

5617.88 --> 5623.04
bread I even consume so yeah it's kind

5620.52 --> 5627.0
of expensive it's also organic it's

5623.04 --> 5629.639
spelled it's sour though it's freaking

5627.0 --> 5631.88
amazing it like the best bread I've ever

5629.639 --> 5633.719
tasted I buy from a store that that's

5631.88 --> 5636.4800000000005
amazing

5633.719 --> 5640.76
usually it's not the best bread ever

5636.48 --> 5643.239
well this one particular Baker is really

5640.76 --> 5643.2390000000005
really

5644.32 --> 5647.599999999999
good not

5647.92 --> 5654.84
cornbread but yeah you might like

5650.679 --> 5657.4800000000005
that and that's all I need and then I

5654.84 --> 5659.76
have like one bread a week which would

5657.48 --> 5663.678999999999
cost me

5659.76 --> 5667.52
like5 $450 yes it everything's become

5663.679 --> 5670.08
like insanely expensive here

5667.52 --> 5672.6
everything dude it won't be long before

5670.08 --> 5676.5599999999995
a glass of water is going to cost you

5714.4 --> 5717.599999999999
dim sun

5718.119 --> 5723.4
what what is that

5720.4 --> 5723.4
skeptic

5730.4 --> 5737.239
you love to learn how to make

5732.48 --> 5739.759999999999
sourdough well you just have to find the

5737.239 --> 5743.919999999999
right bacteria

5739.76 --> 5746.6
basically and then you just keep keep it

5743.92 --> 5750.4
alive so it's like you just take a piece

5746.6 --> 5753.76
of sour dough you put it into the new

5750.4 --> 5756.159
bread then you take a piece of it and

5753.76 --> 5758.320000000001
you keep it separate and then you use

5756.159 --> 5759.96
that for the next one and you just keep

5758.32 --> 5765.5599999999995
using it over and over and over again

5759.96 --> 5767.76
the same piece of piece of what is it it

5765.56 --> 5770.639
isn't yeast

5767.76 --> 5774.360000000001
right I'm confused I know very little

5770.639 --> 5774.36
about souro I just know it's

5775.56 --> 5780.320000000001
great yeah what I described is actually

5778.159 --> 5783.32
yeast which isn't

5780.32 --> 5783.32
sourdo

5784.0 --> 5789.119
right sourdough culture but it isn't

5787.88 --> 5792.56
yeast

5789.119 --> 5792.5599999999995
right n I'm

5797.04 --> 5803.36
confused but it's it's very

5800.159 --> 5805.96
similar to yeast it just it's not

5803.36 --> 5805.96
exactly the

5810.28 --> 5813.28
same

5823.36 --> 5828.679
fermented yeast isn't that

5825.679 --> 5828.679
like

5829.679 --> 5837.08
double isn't yeast the thing that is

5832.92 --> 5839.36
actually ferment like put the yeast is

5837.08 --> 5839.36
Def

5840.199 --> 5843.199
ferment

5844.4 --> 5850.159
fermenting yeast kind of sounds like wet

5847.28 --> 5850.159
water to

5870.199 --> 5873.199
me

5878.28 --> 5883.5599999999995
someone asked py bread

5880.36 --> 5883.5599999999995

5897.76 --> 5903.1990000000005
one oh man that Illuminati cound did

5901.239 --> 5906.5599999999995
definitely hit the

5903.199 --> 5910.4
spot I feel so much

5906.56 --> 5912.4800000000005
better I still felt weird this morning I

5910.4 --> 5915.08
don't know what it was though where

5912.48 --> 5915.08
that's coming

5916.56 --> 5922.92
from but I felt that yesterday too and

5919.04 --> 5922.92
it just made me so

5924.239 --> 5928.638999999999
negative and I felt that this morning

5926.4 --> 5930.119
too but I'm struggling against it and I

5928.639 --> 5933.119
think that I'm

5930.119 --> 5933.119
winning

5934.04 --> 5937.92
it's just that in my memory it's just I

5936.119 --> 5941.5599999999995
really [ __ ] up yesterday and like

5937.92 --> 5944.04
yesterday was just kind of a shitty

5941.56 --> 5946.2390000000005
show which is like really disappointing

5944.04 --> 5947.84
because the shows before that were

5946.239 --> 5951.32
absolutely

5947.84 --> 5951.32
fabulous they were

5960.04 --> 5963.04
great

5970.44 --> 5974.28
H okay seeking star water that's

5974.32 --> 5980.5599999999995
interesting I guess you the Betty bread

5977.199 --> 5980.5599999999995
maker that was

5981.84 --> 5988.159000000001
summoned you see Dell is live yeah now

5984.76 --> 5992.1990000000005
Dell is still just screaming little

5988.159 --> 5995.28
baby he wants his upward accelerating

5992.199 --> 5998.28
Earth the stationary

5995.28 --> 5998.28
earthers

6013.719 --> 6019.96
you but yeah I'm not really I don't care

6016.8 --> 6022.08
if D's life I don't care what when is

6019.96 --> 6023.679
just whining about aboard moving Earth

6022.08 --> 6027.08
and there's no

6023.679 --> 6029.76
proof I've already like I don't want to

6027.08 --> 6033.08
say it over and over and over again I

6029.76 --> 6035.1990000000005
said it right when it came out put it in

6033.08 --> 6038.8
the title of my

6035.199 --> 6042.119
show like there's nothing else to

6038.8 --> 6043.639
add i' just be repeating that over and

6042.119 --> 6046.679
over

6043.639 --> 6048.36
again and Del doesn't listen he has

6046.679 --> 6051.92
never

6048.36 --> 6057.5599999999995
responded to anything I said

6051.92 --> 6060.92
even once he never responded even

6057.56 --> 6064.159000000001
once to my explanation as to why you

6060.92 --> 6065.639
couldn't prove it it it just not even

6064.159 --> 6068.5599999999995
responded

6065.639 --> 6071.08
once so he's not interested he just

6068.56 --> 6071.080000000001
wants to

6072.159 --> 6077.0
break Flat Earth again he just wants to

6075.199 --> 6079.839999999999
break it it's like

6077.0 --> 6081.56
no no you don't have to have you don't

6079.84 --> 6084.4400000000005
have to have science

6081.56 --> 6086.92
anything is just you're wrong because

6084.44 --> 6090.119
you're Nathan Oakley and

6086.92 --> 6093.719
fed you're just wrong because we're here

6090.119 --> 6095.88
to destroy it because we're Gatekeepers

6093.719 --> 6100.119
yeah D's a [ __ ] gatekeeper if I ever

6095.88 --> 6103.36
saw one most distinct gatekeeper that's

6100.119 --> 6103.36
out there in Flat

6109.84 --> 6113.4800000000005
Earth

6112.04 --> 6115.96
like what what are you going to learn

6113.48 --> 6115.959999999999
from that

6118.199 --> 6122.678999999999
guy right let me just ask the

6122.92 --> 6131.4400000000005
chat try and dig deep to

6127.44 --> 6136.48
any like flat earth related physics

6131.44 --> 6137.879999999999
related anything ever that you learned

6136.48 --> 6141.4
directly from

6137.88 --> 6144.36
now name one thing

6141.4 --> 6145.96
one thing that you specifically learned

6144.36 --> 6149.5199999999995
from

6145.96 --> 6149.52
Dell just one

6151.52 --> 6157.52
thing and with one thing I don't mean

6154.239 --> 6160.44
unproven nonsense statements but any

6157.52 --> 6163.52
actual things that we're still like

6160.44 --> 6163.5199999999995
carrying forth

6164.44 --> 6169.759999999999
altogether he was the best flat Smacker

6167.44 --> 6174.159
I ever heard

6169.76 --> 6176.56
before he went over the ice

6174.159 --> 6179.5599999999995
wall yeah no he had some interesting

6176.56 --> 6182.280000000001
street videos Street activist video I

6179.56 --> 6185.2390000000005
agree he like the way he talked to to

6182.28 --> 6187.44
those teenagers and all that that worked

6185.239 --> 6189.718999999999
he was kind of good at

6187.44 --> 6194.159
that problem is he's just [ __ ]

6189.719 --> 6196.88
[ __ ] so yeah he might be very good

6194.159 --> 6199.0
socially to be able to explain it to

6196.88 --> 6202.679
younger Teena he might be very good at

6199.0 --> 6205.719
that problem is he's cogn L [ __ ]

6202.679 --> 6208.08
[ __ ] so those teenagers were

6205.719 --> 6211.76
basically lucky that his head wasn't

6208.08 --> 6214.679
filled with absolute horeshit at the

6211.76 --> 6216.4400000000005
time but actually the more logical

6214.679 --> 6218.599
argumentation though they were just

6216.44 --> 6222.159
lucky that he wasn't [ __ ] full-blown

6218.599 --> 6224.159000000001
[ __ ] when he was doing that like now

6222.159 --> 6226.199
can you imagine Dell with this hor [ __ ]

6224.159 --> 6230.159
going on the street talking to teens and

6226.199 --> 6231.44
all that [ __ ] dude they they'd ignore

6230.159 --> 6234.48
him and walk walk

6231.44 --> 6238.48
away that's what would happen right

6234.48 --> 6241.759999999999
now cuz he's [ __ ] out of

6238.48 --> 6243.799999999999
control out of control of

6241.76 --> 6246.76
himself doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's

6243.8 --> 6249.76
doing anymore he's just obsessed

6246.76 --> 6249.76
frustrated

6251.679 --> 6255.159
blindsided there's no

6256.36 --> 6263.598999999999
calm no

6259.159 --> 6263.598999999999
Clarity nothing just whining

6267.679 --> 6273.679
bickering your Scottish impression got

6270.599 --> 6273.679
better from watching

6282.84 --> 6287.96
him SE Clans St

6289.56 --> 6294.719
what

6292.52 --> 6297.400000000001
did I meet Dell at the Amsterdam

6294.719 --> 6297.4
conference

6298.56 --> 6303.280000000001
no I don't think Dell actually goes

6304.84 --> 6310.599
anywhere did anybody ever meet D I mean

6308.52 --> 6312.360000000001
he meets up with like his Scottish

6310.599 --> 6314.52
buddies or

6312.36 --> 6316.5199999999995
whatever I don't think he's ever

6314.52 --> 6318.320000000001
actually like went to a conference or

6316.52 --> 6321.52
met other flat

6318.32 --> 6324.04
earthers I don't think he ever has

6321.52 --> 6328.1990000000005
I think he's actually met more anti flat

6324.04 --> 6328.199
earthers than actual flat earthers in

6328.4 --> 6334.839999999999
person that's because I by now am coming

6332.239 --> 6337.598999999999
to the conclusion that Dell is actually

6334.84 --> 6341.8
an anti flat earther

6337.599 --> 6341.8
gatekeeper and he's probably

6347.76 --> 6352.4800000000005
connected he might be MI

6353.44 --> 6359.719
a public

6355.44 --> 6361.799999999999
face to draw attention distract the real

6359.719 --> 6364.639
gatekeep and I think that's what Dell is

6361.8 --> 6364.639
it's is proving

6373.36 --> 6379.639
it right and and the simplest of simple

6377.199 --> 6381.199
tests that you can do to point any of

6379.639 --> 6384.400000000001
this out is that

6381.199 --> 6388.4
can he admit when he's wrong and then

6384.4 --> 6391.48
adapt to the updated

6388.4 --> 6396.759999999999
information can you do

6391.48 --> 6396.759999999999
that D adapt to being

6397.0 --> 6403.119
wrong

6398.52 --> 6405.56
oh wow can you imagine Dell actually

6403.119 --> 6405.5599999999995
doing

6405.679 --> 6412.4
that yeah no that that doesn't happen

6408.679 --> 6412.4
that doesn't actually happen

6418.32 --> 6423.08
cuz if you're a proper gatekeeper then

6420.52 --> 6425.2390000000005
you can never admit that you're wrong

6423.08 --> 6426.719
right cuz if you admit that you're wrong

6425.239 --> 6429.638999999999
well then a whole bunch of people that

6426.719 --> 6431.88
are on autopilot trusting you as the

6429.639 --> 6435.52
expert in your field they're suddenly

6431.88 --> 6436.679
going to hear like wait you're wrong so

6435.52 --> 6439.040000000001
that means that you could have been

6436.679 --> 6441.08
wrong and then they immediately lose

6439.04 --> 6444.28
intuitive blind

6441.08 --> 6448.599
trust so a proper gatekeeper is in the

6444.28 --> 6450.199
field can never ever admit they're wrong

6448.599 --> 6453.28
under any

6450.199 --> 6456.0
circumstance like even under threat of

6453.28 --> 6459.679
death can never admit they're wrong

6456.0 --> 6462.88
because then they break that

6459.679 --> 6466.08
spell which is their function to keep a

6462.88 --> 6469.32
bunch of autopilot goers going behind

6466.08 --> 6472.32
you to drag them behind you like a

6469.32 --> 6472.32
net

6473.719 --> 6476.679
that's what Gatekeepers do so they can

6475.159 --> 6480.5199999999995
never admit they're wrong because if

6476.679 --> 6483.56
they do then they lose their gatekeeper

6480.52 --> 6487.76
function right if they don't

6483.56 --> 6490.280000000001
adapt to the mistake and correct it and

6487.76 --> 6493.2390000000005
keep admitting that that's like yeah I'm

6490.28 --> 6496.199
permanently going to reference that time

6493.239 --> 6500.5599999999995
when I was wrong and then had to correct

6496.199 --> 6502.879999999999
myself yeah that it never disappears in

6500.56 --> 6504.52
in the memory hole it's like no it's on

6502.88 --> 6507.84
record

6504.52 --> 6510.320000000001
forever that I was wrong and that I

6507.84 --> 6514.119000000001
corrected myself yeah you're never going

6510.32 --> 6514.119
to hear a gatekeeper say such a

6514.4 --> 6518.08
thing they don't do

6527.04 --> 6534.159
that they much rather reference how they

6529.76 --> 6537.08
were banned for their truths for their

6534.159 --> 6539.5599999999995
vague ambiguous truths that they're not

6537.08 --> 6542.599
actually going to describe in the moment

6539.56 --> 6545.76
of bragging about how they got banned

6542.599 --> 6548.119000000001
right no it's just for the

6545.76 --> 6549.88
truth which includes all the [ __ ]

6548.119 --> 6551.32
[ __ ] that they were actually gatekeeping

6549.88 --> 6552.599
and completely wrong about and people

6551.32 --> 6554.44
criticized them about and then they

6552.599 --> 6556.84
ignored it and banned them and just

6554.44 --> 6557.919999999999
moved on like nothing ever happened yeah

6556.84 --> 6562.119000000001
that

6557.92 --> 6562.119
truth yeah

6578.239 --> 6584.239
the most famous ever who gives a [ __ ]

6582.04 --> 6586.0
famous F

6584.239 --> 6589.0
years come

6586.0 --> 6589.0
on

6589.119 --> 6592.119
dude

6596.199 --> 6603.239
it was in 2009 like nobody's famous I

6599.76 --> 6606.719
mean now they sort of sort of might be a

6603.239 --> 6610.04
little but nobody's freaking famous okay

6606.719 --> 6612.08
in Flat Earth so just that's nonsense to

6610.04 --> 6616.56
say it like that

6612.08 --> 6620.84
but I met Adam mein I met Nathan Oakley

6616.56 --> 6624.1990000000005
I think I met Mark Sargeant I met

6620.84 --> 6626.76
jiren meeting is a big

6624.199 --> 6631.36
word

6626.76 --> 6631.360000000001
uh I think I at least saw Bob

6631.76 --> 6640.0
noell

6633.44 --> 6642.879999999999
and what else Karen B definitely met

6640.0 --> 6644.719
Nora bunch of other people that I kind

6642.88 --> 6650.2390000000005
of sort of

6644.719 --> 6652.0
forgot but yeah I mean famous that's

6650.239 --> 6654.239
huge

6652.0 --> 6655.159
exaggeration but I met met a whole bunch

6654.239 --> 6658.36
of

6655.159 --> 6663.719
them who I specifically didn't

6658.36 --> 6663.719
meet was Martin litka and Patricia

6664.88 --> 6670.36
ster it would have been cool to meet

6667.079 --> 6672.599
Martin leka back then and I really

6670.36 --> 6674.839999999999
wanted to meet Patricia steer but that

6672.599 --> 6677.679
didn't happen that was like a massive

6674.84 --> 6677.679
disappointment to

6678.96 --> 6681.96
me

6684.88 --> 6692.4400000000005
what was the Dracula guy's name what are

6688.0 --> 6692.44
you talking about dang

6694.28 --> 6698.719
what you're scared of Karen

6705.48 --> 6711.959999999999
why why are you scared of Karen what's

6708.4 --> 6711.96
the scary about her

6725.44 --> 6729.759999999999
the most of the more well-known are

6727.56 --> 6733.280000000001
suspect to you okay fair enough Richard

6729.76 --> 6733.280000000001
G that's usually how that

6738.88 --> 6745.599
works

6741.8 --> 6745.599
had I had him on the show

6751.679 --> 6759.8
what I don't remember Dan it's

6756.639 --> 6762.52
weird oh scuba Dracula you mean yeah

6759.8 --> 6765.0
that guy he's not exactly famous but

6762.52 --> 6767.2390000000005
he's a pretty cool guy very is like such

6765.0 --> 6771.679
an

6767.239 --> 6776.239
activist yeah the Canadian

6771.679 --> 6776.2390000000005

6777.239 --> 6780.4
cool I

6780.92 --> 6786.4800000000005
think yeah but but it was scuba Dracula

6784.28 --> 6788.44
I'm still subscribed to him by the way

6786.48 --> 6790.0
so you can find him in my subscribers

6788.44 --> 6793.089999999999
list I

6790.0 --> 6793.09
[Music]

6794.32 --> 6799.96
think what a name by the way is who

6797.84 --> 6803.400000000001
comes up with the names like that oh I

6799.96 --> 6803.4
don't know if his Channel's still out

6807.0 --> 6811.28
there it could be that he's been removed

6809.44 --> 6814.4
he had been engaging in a lot of

6811.28 --> 6814.4
political related

6816.119 --> 6822.36
videosa yeah I did also met meet Rob he

6819.04 --> 6825.8
was also there I think rska was there

6822.36 --> 6825.799999999999
right wasn't he I don't

6828.159 --> 6833.4
remember but yeah no Mark Sergeant is a

6830.88 --> 6833.400000000001
really cool

6837.199 --> 6843.678999999999
dude like a lot of people are sort of

6839.719 --> 6848.2390000000005
suspicious about him which I get I get

6843.679 --> 6852.079
why you have that I actually do trust

6848.239 --> 6855.638999999999
him like as in his

6852.079 --> 6860.28
person he probably knows [ __ ] he

6855.639 --> 6862.159000000001
probably knows Secret Service people and

6860.28 --> 6865.48
all that [ __ ] I don't think he's

6862.159 --> 6865.48
literally a part of

6865.88 --> 6872.04
it but he probably knows some secret

6869.679 --> 6874.96
people that are like yeah I can talk

6872.04 --> 6877.679
about that they get in

6874.96 --> 6883.199
trouble but I mean he's a really nice

6877.679 --> 6883.1990000000005
