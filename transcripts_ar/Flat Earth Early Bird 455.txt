you

47.8 --> 55.089999999999996
good morning welcome to flatter the

51.71 --> 57.05
earlybird number Wow

55.09 --> 58.46
455 I'm your host

57.05 --> 60.26
Arwen and before we start the show

58.46 --> 62.39
please don't forget to share it on any

60.26 --> 64.16
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

62.39 --> 65.81
already subscribed to my channel hit the

64.16 --> 67.61
bell notification so you know when I'm

65.81 --> 70.46000000000001
going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

67.61 --> 72.53
Amsterdam time every day and please also

70.46 --> 74.33
do support me through the paypal patreon

72.53 --> 77.81
my GoFundMe and the super chat that

74.33 --> 81.259
would be much appreciated so yeah today

77.81 --> 86.119
the weather is that's a little bit more

81.259 --> 91.34
cloudy again no rain so far also wind is

86.119 --> 103.31
not as bad but it's kind of like water

91.34 --> 104.99000000000001
cold a little I've noticed yeah they're

103.31 --> 107.75
planting even more trees back there

104.99 --> 110.69
apparently they decided that next to the

107.75 --> 113.33
water that is beyond this part maybe you

110.69 --> 117.49
can see little piece there they're

113.33 --> 126.86
planting whole rows of new trees ok fine

117.49 --> 130.63
why not gather like they're doing all

126.86 --> 134.59
kinds of things with this place first it

130.63 --> 137.75
that plain ground now

134.59 --> 143.56900000000002
yeah and then the bridge on the other

137.75 --> 146.0
side and anyway it is kind of

143.569 --> 150.70899999999997
interesting to follow it over the over

146.0 --> 158.75
the years now so yeah today I have with

150.709 --> 169.31
me just green tea let's see was in chat

158.75 --> 169.549
I hope it's not stuck we'll figure it

169.31 --> 177.47
out

169.549 --> 186.18900000000002
anyway yeah see all right so a GM was

177.47 --> 186.189
first they lie Ohio J Omega James Mason

187.359 --> 195.79000000000002
Obama Co Giulio Pavan good servant

200.28 --> 209.409
mark colors the atom ikan yeah good to

206.2 --> 214.2
see you all this it's Thursday already

209.409 --> 221.68
madness this week is flown by here I see

214.2 --> 229.17999999999998
that they're bringing in a new tree see

221.68 --> 229.68900000000002
that tree by tree that transported like

229.18 --> 231.43
this

229.689 --> 240.34
I guess when they're still that size

231.43 --> 243.4
it's very doable yeah but it's kind of

240.34 --> 245.26
funny out of works that it seems like

243.4 --> 250.739
they've really figured out how to kind

245.26 --> 255.97
of industrialize the the tree system in

250.739 --> 258.009
in the city in it ya know I don't like

255.97 --> 260.68
when they cut down big trees I never

258.009 --> 264.58000000000004
liked it but at least they're putting

260.68 --> 267.55
some trees back that that tractor is a

264.58 --> 274.62
New Holland teeth 5 yeah it does look

267.55 --> 274.62
kind of high-tech I guess it is

282.78 --> 290.94
I'm not too familiar with with tractors

286.11 --> 294.99
but yeah they're getting all the hype

290.94 --> 296.96999999999997
now because it's you know farmers farmer

294.99 --> 304.62
equipment farmer technology it's all

296.97 --> 307.86
awesome it's all super useful so yeah

304.62 --> 311.79
it's very yeah it resonates with the

307.86 --> 314.37
typical logos being based in

311.79 --> 315.87
homesteading so tractors yeah there's

314.37 --> 317.43
going to be more and more people that

315.87 --> 321.51
know a lot about tractors and that's a

317.43 --> 328.89
good thing because there are awesome

321.51 --> 333.44
pieces of Technology farming simulator

328.89 --> 333.44
okay huh I didn't even know

338.919 --> 344.169
well I should have known probably

341.039 --> 348.34
considering like how I remember like how

344.169 --> 351.21
crazy the whole like one of the first

348.34 --> 354.48999999999995
like online gaming addictions that game

351.21 --> 356.169
that became really widely known that God

354.49 --> 360.25
attention was this I don't even remember

356.169 --> 363.849
the name this one basic farming game on

360.25 --> 365.469
Facebook that was free and everybody or

363.849 --> 370.0
a lot of people would come to get

365.469 --> 372.46
completely obsessed over it like even

370.0 --> 373.93
Alex Jones did stories about that like

372.46 --> 375.81899999999996
ten years ago what is the name again

373.93 --> 381.069
anyway so yeah

375.819 --> 384.0
farming games have been also yeah been a

381.069 --> 386.65000000000003
things or farmville yeah that's the one

384.0 --> 388.599
it's probably still going I don't know I

386.65 --> 393.60999999999996
don't keep track and I'm never joined

388.599 --> 395.229
Facebook so I don't know this but that's

393.61 --> 396.849
been going on for a while but yeah I

395.229 --> 399.87899999999996
could imagine that there could be much

396.849 --> 407.169
more serious farming simulator type

399.879 --> 409.15000000000003
games and yeah if they're if they're

407.169 --> 412.27
well researched then it can even be

409.15 --> 418.29999999999995
halfway interesting you could actually

412.27 --> 425.69899999999996
learn a few things from it love Amanda

418.3 --> 425.699
you James Mason studied Cosentino

428.0 --> 437.93
and the Koala right so yesterday

452.74 --> 455.52
all right

457.52 --> 465.43
hmm not good to hear you slept well I'm

460.19 --> 465.43
into you yeah I slept pretty well myself

468.37 --> 475.009
didn't make it too late but didn't make

471.289 --> 483.68
it too early either there was just a lot

475.009 --> 487.509
of stuff going on very late oh yeah now

483.68 --> 491.81
I remember that wood that was so odd

487.509 --> 496.06
right so there's all kinds of stuff

491.81 --> 500.11
going going down on the internet but

496.06 --> 503.03000000000003
yeah eventually I kind of at the end of

500.11 --> 506.3
everything that was doing at yeah played

503.03 --> 513.8199999999999
games again but also watch stuff here

506.3 --> 517.01
and there okay let's take for you to

513.82 --> 518.75
even watch a bit of Randy just to see

517.01 --> 522.289
yeah I try to keep pulse

518.75 --> 525.589
what's going on with Randy because I

522.289 --> 527.48
don't like all the sceptic nonsense but

525.589 --> 534.94
on the other hand it seems to be some

527.48 --> 536.99
kind of like maybe it's just like Oh

534.94 --> 538.4590000000001
gases are bubbling up and it's

536.99 --> 543.62
transforming I don't know where it's

538.459 --> 545.42
going where he is going but yeah you

543.62 --> 548.32
know maybe this whole corona nonsense

545.42 --> 548.3199999999999
it's just a phase

550.12 --> 557.45
but anyway yeah I ended up with lift a

553.1 --> 558.0500000000001
veil and unexpectedly yeah god that's

557.45 --> 562.779
right

558.05 --> 567.9399999999999
yeah just psychological warfare man I

562.779 --> 567.9399999999999
didn't really like that Hey

568.31 --> 573.949
right I almost thought there was a delay

570.589 --> 578.509
in OBS but it's just a trick of mine

573.949 --> 582.579
yeah but yeah weirdly enough I got kind

578.509 --> 587.4490000000001
of he put his livestream like on a live

582.579 --> 593.269
streamed democratic debate and it was

587.449 --> 596.24
like oh what serious but it actually

593.269 --> 598.879
turned out to be halfway interesting now

596.24 --> 607.4300000000001
it was absolutely ridiculous of course

598.879 --> 609.74
most of it didn't but it's the only way

607.43 --> 611.809
yeah the the saw something a process

609.74 --> 613.97
happening like they were all at each

611.809 --> 617.329
other's throats in a way that was a sign

613.97 --> 621.4390000000001
of tension was pretty high and they were

617.329 --> 624.2299999999999
all doing their utmost best like in a

621.439 --> 625.79
way but yeah from their own perspective

624.23 --> 630.0790000000001
and it was actually kind of fascinating

625.79 --> 634.61
to behold what was transpiring like the

630.079 --> 637.37
game they were trying to play and yeah I

634.61 --> 639.8290000000001
didn't expect that I'd actually keep

637.37 --> 641.9590000000001
watching just to see what was going on

639.829 --> 643.519
there even though yeah political wise

641.959 --> 648.7399999999999
it's just all bad news

643.519 --> 653.6
this is but they would even attack one

648.74 --> 656.689
another on with actual yeah with actual

653.6 --> 659.24
issues and errors and and it got like

656.689 --> 661.25
almost in yeah it reminded me a little

659.24 --> 664.399
bit about ballers like getting in each

661.25 --> 666.199
other's hair because for example because

664.399 --> 667.67
of the issue with the geometrical curve

666.199 --> 673.87
no longer being there it kind of

667.67 --> 677.0
reminded me of that like and this is

673.87 --> 682.179
yeah it came off very wrong I know

677.0 --> 685.61
Sarita Cosentino I know yeah but I

682.179 --> 689.389
didn't expect to be kind of interested

685.61 --> 693.0790000000001
and also yeah there's a there's some

689.389 --> 696.49
really creepy players in town that's

693.079 --> 696.4899999999999
what I get to feel like

699.97 --> 704.03
but because they were at each other's

702.56 --> 706.64
throat it was kind of funny

704.03 --> 708.26
it was almost yeah now I remember it was

706.64 --> 709.85
almost like they were trying to pull a

708.26 --> 712.79
trump on one another

709.85 --> 714.71
remember how Trump like got this this

712.79 --> 718.0699999999999
insane momentum because he certainly

714.71 --> 720.47
just broke with the theaters baseline

718.07 --> 722.5100000000001
and started directly attacking with

720.47 --> 725.63
truthful things that weren't supposed to

722.51 --> 728.24
be talked about as it were that kind of

725.63 --> 730.37
thing and that really pulled in a lot of

728.24 --> 731.96
momentum for Trump because he did it

730.37 --> 734.33
exactly at the right time he really

731.96 --> 737.8100000000001
started their big risk and it paid off

734.33 --> 741.4100000000001
big time and it seems almost like

737.81 --> 744.3199999999999
they're envious and they won a sort of

741.41 --> 746.27
get the same glory but they don't have

744.32 --> 748.6700000000001
the base because it's all just

746.27 --> 755.12
doublethink lies most of it and it's

748.67 --> 757.49
everything they want is crazy and also

755.12 --> 762.35
one thing that got me really agitated is

757.49 --> 765.34
just this this phony environmentalism

762.35 --> 768.65
that I got off them it was really bad

765.34 --> 772.15
like well we have two carbon neutral oh

768.65 --> 776.54
I hate it it's so stupid

772.15 --> 778.79
like first you get to hear like well

776.54 --> 780.7099999999999
there were so many of actual pollutions

778.79 --> 783.7099999999999
and issues so you know those are real

780.71 --> 786.08
issues but then no we got the solution

783.71 --> 788.4200000000001
make everything carbon neutral well that

786.08 --> 790.4300000000001
doesn't actually solve the pollution

788.42 --> 793.91
that's the freakin problem it actually

790.43 --> 796.91
makes it worse and as time has

793.91 --> 802.03
progressed and like the fruits are being

796.91 --> 804.5
reaped from from what do you say the the

802.03 --> 807.86
tryouts of all the new environmental

804.5 --> 810.62
things like this solar panels and wind

807.86 --> 813.02
turbines and all that yeah it's just

810.62 --> 817.27
getting figured out like it's not really

813.02 --> 821.84
effective so carbon neutral is just a

817.27 --> 823.46
technical some that that can be used as

821.84 --> 826.07
a label on top of it all but it is

823.46 --> 828.889
actually not environmentally friendly at

826.07 --> 833.5690000000001
all and especially doesn't help

828.889 --> 836.72
lucien at all and there's more problems

833.569 --> 839.389
for example with electric cars well you

836.72 --> 842.6
know there's like once it hazardous

839.389 --> 843.0790000000001
dangerous dangers like get exploding

842.6 --> 844.85
[ __ ]

843.079 --> 848.6289999999999
although yeah it depends on the

844.85 --> 851.48
manufacturing but there's just now a

848.629 --> 853.279
more general problem that in regions

851.48 --> 856.759
where a lot of people use electric cars

853.279 --> 859.959
when they all for example come home and

856.759 --> 862.749
start loading up especially in cities

859.959 --> 865.6389999999999
there's brown outs and I think that I

862.749 --> 867.889
potentially am even noticing that that

865.639 --> 870.859
just suddenly things starts glitching

867.889 --> 872.989
and that it seems like a brownout I'm

870.859 --> 875.359
very glad my computer has a system to

872.989 --> 878.3290000000001
make sure it doesn't it's not affected

875.359 --> 880.7900000000001
by that otherwise it would be screwed

878.329 --> 884.169
but yeah Brown outs are happening and

880.79 --> 887.569
it's probably has to do something with

884.169 --> 891.759
all the electric cars that just drain

887.569 --> 891.759
huge amount of electricity from the net

894.519 --> 901.069
right and the production of it is also

897.889 --> 903.41
it takes more minute yeah it is a rough

901.069 --> 906.079
some it's not it's not more efficient

903.41 --> 911.259
it's not actually dreamed because

906.079 --> 914.54
production and expenditure of resources

911.259 --> 918.679
is basically what real environmental

914.54 --> 921.41
friendly industry comes down to to get

918.679 --> 924.879
it all as efficient as possible with the

921.41 --> 928.04
least amount of side waste so and that's

924.879 --> 930.23
this isn't working it in my personal

928.04 --> 936.049
opinion it's much more sensible to

930.23 --> 939.679
continue the the oil-based fuel system

936.049 --> 943.279
and gas and and all that all these types

939.679 --> 946.309
of resources but especially feel

943.279 --> 949.549
petroleum because it's getting better

946.309 --> 953.569
it's getting more refined and there is

949.549 --> 956.059
definitely a hope that also the side

953.569 --> 959.51
waste product issue that is an issue

956.059 --> 964.5699999999999
with with kerosene and all that

959.51 --> 968.51
that there can be a solution to that

964.57 --> 970.4300000000001
yeah instead of that it's de sub the

968.51 --> 972.26
toxic substances are being abused which

970.43 --> 974.81
is what kind of the elites also have

972.26 --> 976.22
done like fluoride in a way is a bit of

974.81 --> 980.9499999999999
a side product and it's being used

976.22 --> 984.65
literally that the poison people and

980.95 --> 987.08
yeah and there's much more that that is

984.65 --> 989.99
a side waste issue with with it with it

987.08 --> 992.7800000000001
but still effectively as to how much

989.99 --> 996.13
energy is expended and how efficient it

992.78 --> 1002.17
is fuel is really the most efficient and

996.13 --> 1005.77
durable transport fuel transportable

1002.17 --> 1008.55
fuel it's not a big battery that's not

1005.77 --> 1011.86
as efficient for transport issues

1008.55 --> 1015.8499999999999
battery systems are much more useful for

1011.86 --> 1019.2
reliable electric self-sufficiency for

1015.85 --> 1021.88
example when electric is predominant in

1019.2 --> 1024.43
like for example big buildings it was

1021.88 --> 1031.24
good to have a big battery charge or

1024.43 --> 1034.8100000000002
whatever but yeah in a car fuel is

1031.24 --> 1038.3700000000001
extremely more efficient really and it

1034.81 --> 1042.31
can become much better much less toxic

1038.37 --> 1044.5
yeah industry has technically already

1042.31 --> 1047.1599999999999
prepared progressed to the point where

1044.5 --> 1051.49
all the toxic site waste that comes from

1047.16 --> 1054.39
this using it can all be filtered out so

1051.49 --> 1058.27
that effectively only co2 and water

1054.39 --> 1061.96
would come out and those are not toxic

1058.27 --> 1065.41
and then of course there would be

1061.96 --> 1067.69
sideways still but it would be in the

1065.41 --> 1071.5
filters it would not be actually

1067.69 --> 1073.96
toxifying the people and so I think that

1071.5 --> 1077.35
is more sensible direction for like this

1073.96 --> 1080.17
age at least for the baseline and then

1077.35 --> 1086.4099999999999
yeah whatever else can develop all on

1080.17 --> 1088.3600000000001
top of that it is really a technological

1086.41 --> 1091.48
issue it is almost the idea like you

1088.36 --> 1096.4599999999998
know in a way see

1091.48 --> 1099.6100000000001
or rather dvds are kind of outdated you

1096.46 --> 1103.57
know since we have like USB sticks and

1099.61 --> 1107.1999999999998
everything but still there are things

1103.57 --> 1109.84
about it that are kind of different from

1107.2 --> 1113.77
USB from more pure electronic based

1109.84 --> 1115.8999999999999
storage systems that make it a little

1113.77 --> 1120.73
bit more durable insert the situation so

1115.9 --> 1127.15
to completely then take it out is just

1120.73 --> 1131.2
not like yeah you should kind of keep it

1127.15 --> 1133.72
in in a way for a long run and then

1131.2 --> 1137.56
eventually it might become so completely

1133.72 --> 1139.84
outdated because something else provides

1137.56 --> 1142.03
the function that it really has in

1139.84 --> 1144.04
opposition to the new developments even

1142.03 --> 1145.6
better and then it can be kind of

1144.04 --> 1149.59
scrapped it's kind of like how tape

1145.6 --> 1151.8999999999999
recording has been scrapped because it

1149.59 --> 1154.03
because of the many disadvantages is

1151.9 --> 1157.3300000000002
just completely unnecessary in the face

1154.03 --> 1161.71
of the new possibilities and so that is

1157.33 --> 1163.87
how I think that that fossil fuel based

1161.71 --> 1169.75
engine systems and everything should be

1163.87 --> 1171.4299999999998
kept until it is truly outdated and it

1169.75 --> 1173.68
isn't for this time because it is still

1171.43 --> 1177.3100000000002
extremely efficient for the issues that

1173.68 --> 1180.3600000000001
we have now and how industry and society

1177.31 --> 1184.1499999999999
goes about so that's my view

1180.36 --> 1186.9099999999999
environmentally on what the focus should

1184.15 --> 1190.38
be in environmental movement's and in

1186.91 --> 1197.3500000000001
just the this period of of that will and

1190.38 --> 1201.67
not nonsense about co2 you know co2 is

1197.35 --> 1205.4699999999998
not a toxic waste it's the one thing

1201.67 --> 1205.47
that's basically not a toxic waste

1210.57 --> 1217.32
so all right well typically that is

1215.58 --> 1219.24
something that stands out with me

1217.32 --> 1223.769
because I care I am kind of an

1219.24 --> 1226.35
environmental caring person I'm all for

1223.769 --> 1230.73
recycling even though it has limited

1226.35 --> 1233.1
uses effectively industry but it's just

1230.73 --> 1236.429
room for more development there's so

1233.1 --> 1239.82
much more look a big issue with human

1236.429 --> 1243.5
society is busying therapy well why

1239.82 --> 1246.21
don't you use all that busying therapy

1243.5 --> 1250.62
instead of wasting it on pure fantasy

1246.21 --> 1255.2
nonsense why don't you just use it to

1250.62 --> 1258.539
actually deepen figuring out how to

1255.2 --> 1260.3400000000001
actually be more durable for real and

1258.539 --> 1265.61
not just trendy not just virtuous

1260.34 --> 1265.61
sickening not just going with some fake

1266.0 --> 1273.559
financial baseline narrative just to get

1271.2 --> 1276.1490000000001
ahead or some because that is all fake

1273.559 --> 1278.46
environmentalism like the whole carbon

1276.149 --> 1282.6899999999998
credit system is a financial scam and

1278.46 --> 1285.0900000000001
it's basically destroying the actual

1282.69 --> 1288.45
environmental movement and its spirit

1285.09 --> 1290.549
from the inside out from the financial

1288.45 --> 1293.3890000000001
core inside out and it's built it's

1290.549 --> 1295.529
destroying its gonna destroy it

1293.389 --> 1297.389
environmental consciousness people are

1295.529 --> 1301.259
just gonna do crazy things because they

1297.389 --> 1305.84
completely got things dis contoured it

1301.259 --> 1311.129
because it's just been people been

1305.84 --> 1312.33
derailed concerning real priorities when

1311.129 --> 1316.4399999999998
it comes to pollution and

1312.33 --> 1318.779
environmentalism and now people that

1316.44 --> 1321.029
really care and that are a lot smarter

1318.779 --> 1323.519
they they want to be so easily tricked

1321.029 --> 1326.309
but a lot of people don't have that much

1323.519 --> 1330.559
attention so they will be fooled and

1326.309 --> 1333.48
it's a problem it's a big problem yeah

1330.559 --> 1336.87
it's because things are kind of

1333.48 --> 1339.3600000000001
complicated on that level and so people

1336.87 --> 1342.029
will be more easily fooled than

1339.36 --> 1344.4399999999998
intelligent people would probably expect

1342.029 --> 1346.63
and but on the other hand you

1344.44 --> 1349.0900000000001
the proofs in the pudding we can already

1346.63 --> 1351.0700000000002
see how easily society is manipulated

1349.09 --> 1354.58
how easy people step forward and just

1351.07 --> 1358.54
pair it totally nonsense because it'll

1354.58 --> 1361.06
bring them some cameras some camera

1358.54 --> 1363.7
attention or something anyway yeah

1361.06 --> 1365.9199999999998
that's enough about me and my response

1363.7 --> 1369.01
to the Democratic debates and that I

1365.92 --> 1376.9
watch live it was it was a unique

1369.01 --> 1379.09
experience well yeah just all so each

1376.9 --> 1382.75
character there just had their own weird

1379.09 --> 1391.3899999999999
creepy little thing this is she was

1382.75 --> 1393.19
fascinating and I understand now much

1391.39 --> 1396.22
more like the whole rumors concerning

1393.19 --> 1398.38
vibe I'm starting Biden like that guy he

1396.22 --> 1400.96
really does seem like he's turning more

1398.38 --> 1408.99
and more into Palpatine so weird

1400.96 --> 1412.3
this is Oh God and what's his name again

1408.99 --> 1414.91
that the dragon from New York that's

1412.3 --> 1418.12
what I'm gonna call him it's his name

1414.91 --> 1421.24
again that guy is well he is pretty

1418.12 --> 1428.37
intense but he's just he is like a

1421.24 --> 1428.3700000000001
dragon but not a very good hearted one

1428.86 --> 1439.58
name again Bloomberg right man they

1435.59 --> 1443.84
really they really knew how to they

1439.58 --> 1446.36
really jabbed at him with odd Trump

1443.84 --> 1449.539
related things oh god yes I almost

1446.36 --> 1452.33
forgot why I wanted to forget but holy

1449.539 --> 1455.269
[ __ ] they use Trump issues as a straw

1452.33 --> 1457.6399999999999
man it was like literally the trauma

1455.269 --> 1460.46
weapon it's like the Trump Club and like

1457.64 --> 1465.3700000000001
everybody had to go with you did this

1460.46 --> 1475.76
wrong to job you said Trump Trump Trump

1465.37 --> 1478.4289999999999
it was so so silly to see Bloomberg

1475.76 --> 1482.6299999999999
defending war crimes I have no idea he

1478.429 --> 1485.529
was pretty as I said he was like a

1482.63 --> 1485.529
dragon there

1496.0 --> 1501.07
and you know dragon doesn't necessarily

1498.88 --> 1504.1000000000001
have to be a good creature there's

1501.07 --> 1506.6799999999998
different this is spiritual metaphor

1504.1 --> 1508.6299999999999
this is esoterics right dragons are to

1506.68 --> 1512.71
me pretty much people that are very

1508.63 --> 1514.5400000000002
condensed but dragons what really makes

1512.71 --> 1518.23
dragons dragons what makes them stand

1514.54 --> 1521.35
out as dragons is that they are that

1518.23 --> 1524.92
they usually have big egos that they

1521.35 --> 1527.29
kind of have under control but also the

1524.92 --> 1529.0600000000002
other way around and it's just a unique

1527.29 --> 1534.8799999999999
type of setup and they have a lot of

1529.06 --> 1539.47
energy available to them like real

1534.88 --> 1542.14
dragons do have pride and it's real to

1539.47 --> 1547.96
them it's it's fascinating it's

1542.14 --> 1551.71
complicated but yeah and Dragons sit on

1547.96 --> 1554.5900000000001
gold absolutely yeah and Dragons will

1551.71 --> 1558.82
manipulate the [ __ ] out of everyone and

1554.59 --> 1563.86
everything in a very clever way clever

1558.82 --> 1567.34
clever undetectable schemes and [ __ ] but

1563.86 --> 1571.5
yeah for me it's metaphorical so it's

1567.34 --> 1574.5
esoteric it's or yeah it's ethereal

1571.5 --> 1574.5
anyway

1576.05 --> 1584.6299999999999
[Music]

1581.26 --> 1588.62
right bait 60 RMC fossil fuels will

1584.63 --> 1592.63
never deplete that's right pretty sure

1588.62 --> 1595.1899999999998
that fossil fuels will exist be there

1592.63 --> 1598.49
maybe not in unlimited amounts

1595.19 --> 1599.66
constantly but you don't know you don't

1598.49 --> 1601.82
know what's gonna happen it could be

1599.66 --> 1604.01
even that the more you start to mind

1601.82 --> 1605.8999999999999
them the more comes out of it maybe

1604.01 --> 1608.54
there is a relation between the general

1605.9 --> 1610.7900000000002
pressure build-up of the oil and that if

1608.54 --> 1612.8
it goes under certain pressure that the

1610.79 --> 1615.5
bacteria that actually created from the

1612.8 --> 1619.73
rock and whatever that they will start

1615.5 --> 1621.83
producing more so that if they are being

1619.73 --> 1624.83
conditioned constantly to produce more

1621.83 --> 1630.1299999999999
that they'll get even stronger and more

1624.83 --> 1633.62
oil so the yeah you don't know for sure

1630.13 --> 1636.65
but it is certainly a resource that as

1633.62 --> 1645.59
long as this earth exists I think it

1636.65 --> 1648.77
will be there although it's not yeah the

1645.59 --> 1650.78
nature of some of its substance however

1648.77 --> 1653.99
for example could potentially change

1650.78 --> 1656.5
over time you're not there is always

1653.99 --> 1663.71
unexpected things that can happen

1656.5 --> 1665.72
don't forget but the substance itself

1663.71 --> 1667.49
that rough oil I think yeah it is

1665.72 --> 1672.49
probably something that just keeps on

1667.49 --> 1675.52
coming forever and before it was used

1672.49 --> 1678.41
when people didn't really use it

1675.52 --> 1681.17
eventually then just tar pits would

1678.41 --> 1683.8100000000002
start to pump up and there would be like

1681.17 --> 1685.76
yeah there's a tar pit there and even

1683.81 --> 1688.1
people would start out using that

1685.76 --> 1690.95
knowledge yeah I do for all kinds of

1688.1 --> 1692.48
things and no that's how it kind of

1690.95 --> 1694.4
started and then people start to say hey

1692.48 --> 1697.04
if you could cook it like this then

1694.4 --> 1699.0500000000002
there's like this lightest options and

1697.04 --> 1700.85
it burns really well yeah I get smoky

1699.05 --> 1705.3799999999999
and that is eventually how they figured

1700.85 --> 1706.8799999999999
out oil not because they had to dig in

1705.38 --> 1710.2800000000002
its like oh my god we found these

1706.88 --> 1715.3500000000001
miracle substance no it's just the oil

1710.28 --> 1718.11
eventually there's oil there's tar pits

1715.35 --> 1721.08
and that's how they figured it out and

1718.11 --> 1722.61
then they've raided our wait where is

1721.08 --> 1724.47
this coming from this is coming from

1722.61 --> 1727.289
really deep so that means there's down

1724.47 --> 1731.7
there okay well maybe if we start to

1727.289 --> 1734.039
drill a giant hole in the vicinity of

1731.7 --> 1736.049
such a tar pit we'll get to a good

1734.039 --> 1739.02
source of it and then be able to pump it

1736.049 --> 1741.72
out I'm pretty sure that's probably how

1739.02 --> 1744.929
they originally devised the oil pumping

1741.72 --> 1747.77
mechanisms like in the early industry

1744.929 --> 1750.179
even maybe even before the 19th century

1747.77 --> 1752.4189999999999
makes a lot of sense if you think about

1750.179 --> 1752.419
it

1764.97 --> 1775.309
what no no sledgehammer yeah come on

1780.01 --> 1783.069
[Music]

1790.17 --> 1797.429
did your your entangling two things that

1795.69 --> 1802.8500000000001
have very little to do with one another

1797.429 --> 1805.799
like information in consciousness

1802.85 --> 1811.26
they're not you could say they are not

1805.799 --> 1815.28
natural not in the physical sense you

1811.26 --> 1818.94
know so whatever the conscious of the

1815.28 --> 1824.22
soul or whatever does it doesn't advise

1818.94 --> 1829.23
to the by to the laws of nature because

1824.22 --> 1836.75
it is disk imported from nature when you

1829.23 --> 1836.75
die so it nature no longer applies

1837.62 --> 1848.87
exactly dramatic information is not

1840.299 --> 1848.87
matter yeah really

1850.29 --> 1853.96
[Music]

1861.45 --> 1867.18
ah write them here now that's actually

1865.02 --> 1870.6
an interesting question one that I've

1867.18 --> 1873.3
asked for years how come I don't have

1870.6 --> 1873.98
any more subscribers I know it is weird

1873.3 --> 1877.9199999999998
isn't it

1873.98 --> 1881.31
but I guess I love my show and what I do

1877.92 --> 1884.8100000000002
has certain types of issues that I can

1881.31 --> 1887.31
point out have pointed out that may be

1884.81 --> 1893.85
the cause of me not expanding as much

1887.31 --> 1898.47
and that is I am not very yeah I'm not

1893.85 --> 1900.54
really pre formatting my show enough to

1898.47 --> 1903.54
make it super super entertaining I'm

1900.54 --> 1907.23
really I've always talked to be to be

1903.54 --> 1910.23
the entertainment myself completely as

1907.23 --> 1912.33
much as possible to make it about me to

1910.23 --> 1917.43
make it more like a street performance

1912.33 --> 1919.77
type of setup on YouTube and yeah that's

1917.43 --> 1922.98
gonna exclude certain people that are

1919.77 --> 1926.67
really used to getting prefab little

1922.98 --> 1930.45
video parts or a lot of visuals you know

1926.67 --> 1932.01
and so yeah that way there's a lot of

1930.45 --> 1934.92
people that I think I think are wins

1932.01 --> 1935.46
kind of boring and I get that and on the

1934.92 --> 1938.93
other hand

1935.46 --> 1943.8
yeah there's issues with me being

1938.93 --> 1947.16
ruthlessly honest and some people just

1943.8 --> 1948.87
can't handle it that well because they

1947.16 --> 1950.49
can be good people but they can be

1948.87 --> 1954.1499999999999
dealing with certain things and then

1950.49 --> 1956.04
somebody that is the way I am it kind of

1954.15 --> 1958.0500000000002
rubs them the wrong way or it makes it

1956.04 --> 1961.34
difficult to them so they kind of stay

1958.05 --> 1964.44
away for that and on the other hand at

1961.34 --> 1966.99
the same time because of the combination

1964.44 --> 1971.6000000000001
of all these things of it just being me

1966.99 --> 1975.51
of it being me also thrown out

1971.6 --> 1977.85
spontaneous unique ideas and crystals

1975.51 --> 1979.89
out of nothing literally out of nothing

1977.85 --> 1982.4099999999999
that's what it's like to me it's it

1979.89 --> 1985.2
feels like that's just God God's just

1982.41 --> 1988.3200000000002
it's the creation it just manifests and

1985.2 --> 1990.57
it's miraculous to me sometimes too and

1988.32 --> 1992.4299999999998
I think that a lot of people are kind of

1990.57 --> 1995.309
aware of that and they're kind of

1992.43 --> 1999.289
keeping tabs and I think that I

1995.309 --> 2004.4289999999999
probably have a lot of secret followers

1999.289 --> 2006.529
that don't want to be kind of directly

2004.429 --> 2012.3790000000001
associated but that are very very

2006.529 --> 2016.73
interested and oddly enough and yet this

2012.379 --> 2020.87
can be this could be a mental a personal

2016.73 --> 2023.84
related issue but I I get so many

2020.87 --> 2026.5089999999998
feelings regularly I look out into the

2023.84 --> 2028.549
world i watch other videos i watch other

2026.509 --> 2030.8890000000001
people do streams i watch bigger

2028.549 --> 2033.08
productive watch alex jones still watch

2030.889 --> 2036.2299999999998
a lot of things and I just get this very

2033.08 --> 2038.869
very odd feeling so many times like

2036.23 --> 2044.539
people have been paying attention to me

2038.869 --> 2046.9089999999999
I can't escape it like it's such a weird

2044.539 --> 2050.47
sensation that I just get the feeling

2046.909 --> 2050.4700000000003
like Dave

2055.79 --> 2062.48
and sometimes they can literally point

2058.1 --> 2067.19
at it but yeah what is that is that they

2062.48 --> 2070.79
are there's three approaches to this it

2067.19 --> 2072.83
could be that they are technically

2070.79 --> 2074.63
responding to me because they've seen it

2072.83 --> 2078.56
they've been inspired and they're kind

2074.63 --> 2081.62
of like trying it out it could be that I

2078.56 --> 2086.81
have originally experienced their

2081.62 --> 2089.33
experience and kind of in my visions

2086.81 --> 2093.62
right because I've seen it insane amount

2089.33 --> 2097.94
of things in my vid just literally so

2093.62 --> 2100.7599999999998
many experiences and that I have kind of

2097.94 --> 2103.67
manifested it from them retro actively

2100.76 --> 2105.65
back in time and that I've arrived with

2103.67 --> 2110.27
this spontaneous direction at the same

2105.65 --> 2114.38
time or a third explanation it could be

2110.27 --> 2118.43
that this is some simply a natural

2114.38 --> 2121.9700000000003
consequence of of the Ascension of the

2118.43 --> 2125.4199999999996
frequency and the energy and that we're

2121.97 --> 2128.54
all kind of dipping dipping into the

2125.42 --> 2130.9700000000003
peak or certain individual certain

2128.54 --> 2133.04
connections dipping into that same peak

2130.97 --> 2137.0299999999997
at the same time so things naturally

2133.04 --> 2140.18
come out the same and that that is what

2137.03 --> 2143.42
I'm feeling to me it's very complicated

2140.18 --> 2149.87
and I get flustered a little sometimes

2143.42 --> 2152.81
like what no no that's creepy today did

2149.87 --> 2155.5699999999997
they get that for me so anyway yeah

2152.81 --> 2163.07
that's on top of it sounds pretty crazy

2155.57 --> 2165.1600000000003
right yeah there you go with brutal

2163.07 --> 2165.1600000000003
honesty

2166.02 --> 2172.14
but yeah yeah sensitivity you know it's

2172.56 --> 2180.07
it brings you some really unexpected

2175.45 --> 2182.77
impulses sometimes and I just feel

2180.07 --> 2185.17
sometimes like my intuition has a grab a

2182.77 --> 2188.8
grasp on higher dimensional things that

2185.17 --> 2190.87
my actual conscious has no direct

2188.8 --> 2193.6000000000004
oversight over it kind of almost leaves

2190.87 --> 2196.0
it to my intuition it and I've kind of I

2193.6 --> 2199.3199999999997
kind of trust it too but it's it also

2196.0 --> 2199.32
creeps me out sometimes

2224.39 --> 2229.8689999999997
Oh God

2226.88 --> 2229.869
it's him again

2231.19 --> 2237.849
all right yeah

2234.25 --> 2240.099
and to be fair you know the format that

2237.849 --> 2242.6400000000003
I've engaged in specifically with the

2240.099 --> 2247.29
early bird show it is probably also it

2242.64 --> 2250.69
it has a cap effect because I try to

2247.29 --> 2252.579
draw in the people from my chat in the

2250.69 --> 2257.079
conversations like make them a part of

2252.579 --> 2260.23
it so they can kind of carry the energy

2257.079 --> 2264.13
a little and then hopefully it'll get

2260.23 --> 2266.95
stronger and they can assist me more on

2264.13 --> 2268.569
the level that I need that's kind of

2266.95 --> 2271.359
what I'm hoping for but at the same time

2268.569 --> 2273.31
yeah it still leaves room for trolls to

2271.359 --> 2275.3489999999997
get in a way and actually do the

2273.31 --> 2278.44
opposite and that has a bit of a cap

2275.349 --> 2284.26
effect now one way to avenge yeah the

2278.44 --> 2286.96
one way I could have overcome this is by

2284.26 --> 2292.51
having a lot more subscribers and then a

2286.96 --> 2294.79
membership system you know but that's so

2292.51 --> 2299.05
far out of reach you know ten thousand

2294.79 --> 2308.2799999999997
subscribers yeah how many decades is

2299.05 --> 2308.28
that going to take at this rate so yeah

2319.05 --> 2328.44
yeah yeah yeah I even call them fossil

2323.31 --> 2333.24
fuels not even realizing that because it

2328.44 --> 2339.96
is that's been just the way it's it's

2333.24 --> 2342.08
been kind of introduced but it's

2339.96 --> 2344.85
technically not fossil fuels it's just

2342.08 --> 2349.73
it's much more it's much much better

2344.85 --> 2349.73
designated designated abiotic oil

2359.14 --> 2362.16
likes wins

2378.57 --> 2381.23
yeah

2381.35 --> 2386.75
he had the whole fossil fuel I did like

2384.34 --> 2389.06
literally that story's just so

2386.75 --> 2392.89
ridiculous and she's probably not true

2389.06 --> 2395.57
it's literally provably not true

2392.89 --> 2400.06
because even if you look at the actual

2395.57 --> 2405.6200000000003
abiotic oil substance there's no organic

2400.06 --> 2411.08
components in there not that are that

2405.62 --> 2413.5099999999998
come from typical well rotting of actual

2411.08 --> 2415.7599999999998
flesh subsidy yeah yeah anyway it's

2413.51 --> 2418.55
literally not the same kinda like there

2415.76 --> 2420.9500000000003
is rotting go because it's bacteria so

2418.55 --> 2423.29
there are certain types of substances

2420.95 --> 2425.81
that definitely are in between there but

2423.29 --> 2431.72
there is no little literal traces of

2425.81 --> 2433.73
these actual decayed rotting that

2431.72 --> 2436.6299999999997
there's no traces of any kind of cell

2433.73 --> 2441.71
structure or anything like that see see

2436.63 --> 2444.26
because it's not rotting dinosaur

2441.71 --> 2450.31
corpses or even forests or plants or

2444.26 --> 2450.3100000000004
anything swamps or nothing like that

2455.39 --> 2462.5589999999997
it's just bacteria that under great

2459.41 --> 2465.6189999999997
pressure and he'd apparently start

2462.559 --> 2468.799
transforming certain types of rock into

2465.619 --> 2471.25
a biotic oil until the pressure becomes

2468.799 --> 2471.25
too much

2475.09 --> 2478.1690000000003
[Music]

2526.53 --> 2529.699
[Music]

2535.86 --> 2546.29
you know that symbols for being other

2541.86 --> 2546.29
than that know it no harm done but

2546.64 --> 2549.81
[Music]

2553.53 --> 2556.6090000000004
[Music]

2559.37 --> 2567.89
oh whoa damn hard the time has flown

2561.23 --> 2570.26
yeah hmm let's see

2567.89 --> 2572.16
yeah talked a lot about environmental

2570.26 --> 2575.3500000000004
stuff oil

2572.16 --> 2575.35
[Music]

2582.73 --> 2588.5
all right well in a way to me this is

2585.83 --> 2591.38
kind of also good to get things that I

2588.5 --> 2593.869
am truly interested in kind of off my

2591.38 --> 2596.21
chest a little before I go into the

2593.869 --> 2598.52
Bates where they're obviously got to be

2596.21 --> 2602.8
talking about ballers and like what

2598.52 --> 2602.8
crazy thing they did now again

2603.76 --> 2609.51
which is kind of fun as well

2606.41 --> 2609.5099999999998
[Music]

2640.97 --> 2655.1
the crown dad I am I a biologist no but

2651.29 --> 2658.82
I have had biology in school pretty

2655.1 --> 2661.1
decent at it and I've been interested in

2658.82 --> 2664.61
biology all my life and have dipped into

2661.1 --> 2667.58
all kinds of studies it's like dipped

2664.61 --> 2670.25
into it or God basically was dealing

2667.58 --> 2673.09
with people that have been engaging in

2670.25 --> 2673.09
studies in all directions

2706.38 --> 2718.88
hmm okay hey Paul Roberts you know what

2713.39 --> 2718.8799999999997
that it could literally be tested right

2721.809 --> 2729.13
it's not impossible to actually register

2725.279 --> 2732.249
light-speed like and be able to very

2729.13 --> 2733.9590000000003
manipulate it on the spot and yeah just

2732.249 --> 2738.4889999999996
have an aquarium with filled with water

2733.959 --> 2741.5789999999997
in between the detector and the light

2738.489 --> 2744.339
emitter and then move it out move it out

2741.579 --> 2747.239
of between them and then move it in

2744.339 --> 2747.239
between and you'll see

2754.35 --> 2757.409
[Music]

2771.089 --> 2773.8089999999997
what

2787.83 --> 2799.77
antara bail really alight is instant and

2790.77 --> 2803.55
ice now light is not instantaneous sorry

2799.77 --> 2811.74
I thought it was at first but I've seen

2803.55 --> 2814.61
it that it's not it could dig up the

2811.74 --> 2814.6099999999997
video again

2837.21 --> 2842.71
depends on what light the source is well

2840.1 --> 2843.22
no I don't think there is instantaneous

2842.71 --> 2845.85
light

2843.22 --> 2845.85
really

2860.6 --> 2865.7599999999998
I don't think that energy of any kind is

2863.69 --> 2870.67
is absolutely instantaneous it is

2865.76 --> 2876.8300000000004
electricity absolutely instantaneous or

2870.67 --> 2878.54
yeah you know like even the lightning

2876.83 --> 2880.64
strike has a speed although it could be

2878.54 --> 2883.91
considered that the actual reaction that

2880.64 --> 2886.4
causes the light that we see is a

2883.91 --> 2889.52
secondary process to the electrical

2886.4 --> 2893.26
connection that manifests and then chain

2889.52 --> 2899.99
reacts its bay way back through the

2893.26 --> 2902.4500000000003
electrified air but yeah that process

2899.99 --> 2906.0699999999997
the visual process that is not

2902.45 --> 2906.0699999999997
instantaneous it has a speed

2915.469 --> 2921.829
geoffery bill I'm pretty sure that

2917.67 --> 2921.829
lightning is not a man-made concept

2938.9 --> 2943.909
[Music]

2958.17 --> 2966.779
yeah yes a little Constantino I I heard

2962.039 --> 2970.829
that yesterday PJ says that the the B is

2966.779 --> 2974.089
that Black Swan is a red herring he

2970.829 --> 2978.69
isn't a red herring and he knows it

2974.089 --> 2988.349
slippery little bugger PJ is the red

2978.69 --> 2992.73
herring because only a fool and a red

2988.349 --> 2995.73
herring would say that it is useless

2992.73 --> 2999.45
when it is anything but useless it's not

2995.73 --> 3003.529
it actually does address the core of the

2999.45 --> 3007.3999999999996
points like it's I think that statement

3003.529 --> 3015.23
was probably typically driven by PJ and

3007.4 --> 3018.01
V like but it was absolutely ridiculous

3015.23 --> 3018.01
that he said that

3021.96 --> 3026.369
yeah and he just wants to talk about

3023.76 --> 3027.8390000000004
Aristarchus and he and and all that in

3026.369 --> 3030.119
the dodo and he doesn't even want to

3027.839 --> 3033.48
talk about he just wants to say the

3030.119 --> 3035.73
story and have variations on the way he

3033.48 --> 3037.589
says the story because he doesn't

3035.73 --> 3040.8
develop the story he doesn't actually

3037.589 --> 3046.17
figure out a lot beyond just basic

3040.8 --> 3051.119
correlation geometry Estelle and even

3046.17 --> 3052.4700000000003
into the total psychotic so that's just

3051.119 --> 3053.67
what he does and he doesn't actually

3052.47 --> 3058.47
develop it

3053.67 --> 3060.03
just wants to talk about his story he

3058.47 --> 3062.0989999999997
doesn't like actual technical

3060.03 --> 3065.4900000000002
developments he doesn't like academics

3062.099 --> 3069.079
it's like those are things he can kind

3065.49 --> 3069.0789999999997
of deal with but he doesn't wanna

3089.44 --> 3097.509
appears now no its regice its register

3093.999 --> 3102.1899999999996
ibly slowing down it's not doesn't

3097.509 --> 3107.41
appear don't sneak a pair in there it's

3102.19 --> 3109.569
measurable pretty sure but they test it

3107.41 --> 3113.0789999999997
you know there's a literal way to find

3109.569 --> 3115.749
it out test it do it on camera get it

3113.079 --> 3118.569
out of the way but I'm pretty confident

3115.749 --> 3121.5989999999997
that since light does have a speed then

3118.569 --> 3124.42
the sayings about that things like water

3121.599 --> 3126.9100000000003
slow light down well then there must be

3124.42 --> 3131.259
some kind of legitimacy to it although

3126.91 --> 3133.449
there's other effects that also happen

3131.259 --> 3135.729
when light goes through water and higher

3133.449 --> 3139.799
refraction index based substances that

3135.729 --> 3144.39
effect it much more like the angle

3139.799 --> 3147.609
change the refraction index and the

3144.39 --> 3150.249
refraction blurring up eventually if the

3147.609 --> 3152.219
distance of that medium is far enough so

3150.249 --> 3155.589
it also determines like a lid it's a

3152.219 --> 3157.599
effective limiter to light as well so

3155.589 --> 3161.0389999999998
those are two other types of effects

3157.599 --> 3163.989
that are much more noticeable about it

3161.039 --> 3166.8390000000004
then the actual speed of light which is

3163.989 --> 3170.43
very complicated - you have to like

3166.839 --> 3173.17
really electronically measure it or

3170.43 --> 3176.499
because yeah you can't sense it's just

3173.17 --> 3179.4300000000003
way too fast to even distinguish for the

3176.499 --> 3179.43
regular senses

3187.5 --> 3195.82
sunlight is instant tonight yes sure it

3193.42 --> 3202.0
would be great if you'd actually just

3195.82 --> 3205.2400000000002
spelled it right what yeah the problem

3202.0 --> 3207.19
is you can't really determine the the

3205.24 --> 3209.68
the light speed of the Sun because you

3207.19 --> 3213.76
can't even determine the origin point

3209.68 --> 3215.8289999999997
and I'm even I even go as far as to say

3213.76 --> 3226.2700000000004
that there is no literal origin point

3215.829 --> 3229.3900000000003
it's just manifest it's mysterious but

3226.27 --> 3231.43
with things that we with devices that

3229.39 --> 3235.359
generate light yeah it definitely has a

3231.43 --> 3238.5699999999997
speed measurably so and you can deduce

3235.359 --> 3241.3289999999997
that speed by electronics because you

3238.57 --> 3244.63
have these known factors that it's this

3241.329 --> 3246.7000000000003
the light is here the receiver is there

3244.63 --> 3249.609
well if you don't know where the light

no base the found your deduction on it

3256.18 --> 3261.609
would be arbitrary it would be Oh what

is the distance to the Sun okay Google

3261.609 --> 3265.93
says this is the distance to the Sun

3263.26 --> 3267.67
okay that is going to be what I'm going

3265.93 --> 3269.0789999999997
to use as a foundation because there is

3267.67 --> 3273.819
nothing else that's probably what most

3269.079 --> 3278.619
people end up doing that don't really
