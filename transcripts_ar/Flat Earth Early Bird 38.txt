3.21 --> 11.469999999999999
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.509 --> 17.5
early-bird number 38 I'm your host

11.47 --> 20.92
Arwen and yep well the winter has

17.5 --> 23.41
absolutely broken through this time

20.92 --> 28.150000000000002
because yesterday night it started

23.41 --> 33.870000000000005
snowing and it kept on snowing and

28.15 --> 38.219
snowing and snowing some of it is now

33.87 --> 41.949
yeah not as bad as was yesterday because

38.219 --> 44.859
everything was completely white I wish

41.949 --> 48.329
I'd had a proper camera to fill it to

44.859 --> 53.260000000000005
film it because it was really beautiful

48.329 --> 58.209
but you had the snowflake were blowing

53.26 --> 60.369
in through the window even like big

58.209 --> 63.969
snowflakes all over the place so it was

60.369 --> 66.009
kind of messy here because I didn't

63.969 --> 71.31
realize that yeah I wanted some fresh

66.009 --> 71.31
air so I kept the window open on there a

71.369 --> 77.229
little bit but yeah the snow just came

75.31 --> 80.56
flying right through it so like a pool

77.229 --> 83.53
of molten snow would it was eventually

80.56 --> 87.52
forming at the my floor right in front

83.53 --> 91.119
of my door which is also my window so

87.52 --> 95.499
yeah winter is finally arrived the real

91.119 --> 100.65899999999999
one snow and we're gonna have a white

95.499 --> 101.999
Christmas after all so so racist no just

100.659 --> 107.97900000000001
kidding

101.999 --> 112.03
but yeah I like it though if we want to

107.979 --> 115.719
chat going up back in stop traffic in my

112.03 --> 118.09
rest i hat under seis a few diplomat

115.719 --> 127.29899999999999
david read mr. Rick's

118.09 --> 133.45
GMAC hello so yeah yesterday I pretty

127.299 --> 135.28
much decided I don't I don't even know

133.45 --> 140.44
why I just

135.28 --> 143.26
felt called to finally triac the self

140.44 --> 148.209
force which is like the DNA force plus

143.26 --> 153.069
earlier version limited-edition and just

148.209 --> 159.67000000000002
like screw it I'm gonna try it and that

153.069 --> 165.79
is something special right it is really

159.67 --> 171.64
interesting what it does because I feel

165.79 --> 174.85
as it were as my senses like always

171.64 --> 177.39999999999998
reach out into my body and just try to

174.85 --> 181.15
manage things and like see okay how

177.4 --> 185.14000000000001
stable is this how stable is that how

181.15 --> 187.47
much energy is gathered up here is it a

185.14 --> 192.19
problematic all that thing well when I

187.47 --> 194.1
check my senses now it's almost in

192.19 --> 198.01
recognizable to myself because

194.1 --> 201.85
everything seems so incredibly unusually

198.01 --> 206.32
stable physically like even my voice

201.85 --> 212.95
just almost doesn't seem like my own

206.32 --> 220.66
voice it is such a bizarre experience

212.95 --> 224.5
really but this stuff yeah it has some

220.66 --> 226.989
very serious impact on the shorter and

224.5 --> 228.97
at least and it's supposed to be

226.989 --> 233.609
influencing pretty much everything from

228.97 --> 233.609
heart condition to mental state and

234.69 --> 245.38
condition and well certainly seems to be

237.94 --> 251.95
doing that no problem with confusion I

245.38 --> 255.07
had an incredible night sleep which was

251.95 --> 260.2
pretty much up to one hour ago so I

255.07 --> 263.83
slept like I think like at least 11

260.2 --> 268.5
hours straight without any problem and

263.83 --> 270.45
it was really good but yeah

268.5 --> 273.93
doesn't that he started the show it's a

270.45 --> 284.82
little bit messy because didn't have the

273.93 --> 288.57
proper preparation time yep self force

284.82 --> 292.59
self force yeah it's no longer for sale

288.57 --> 295.02
this was like a limited edition when the

292.59 --> 298.34999999999997
first step after DNA forced the original

295.02 --> 301.04999999999995
formula this is like step up and now it

298.35 --> 302.46000000000004
is what is for sale now that is

301.05 --> 305.19
practically the same thing

302.46 --> 309.12
is called DNA force plus and you get it

305.19 --> 310.29
at the info war store it is incredibly

309.12 --> 316.53000000000003
expensive

310.29 --> 318.99
yeah it's $115 150 but yeah if you're

316.53 --> 320.90999999999997
lucky you can get it on the every

318.99 --> 325.23
discount day and then you can get it for

320.91 --> 331.94
75 bucks which I did by the way I got

325.23 --> 331.94
this one for 75 and there's 120 in these

332.24 --> 342.0
so yeah it is not a I a common folk good

338.76 --> 345.77
it is just really freaking expensive

342.0 --> 350.1
although yeah one could consider okay

345.77 --> 352.979
how much health care crap are you

350.1 --> 354.93
investing in now or what are you

352.979 --> 356.58
thinking oh yeah everything's so good I

354.93 --> 360.84000000000003
got so much money could poor do you ever

356.58 --> 363.45
do and we'll see about my health later

360.84 --> 366.33
well if you just decide you know what

363.45 --> 369.39
I'm gonna spend kind of set aside a

366.33 --> 372.57
little bit of money for this stuff then

369.39 --> 378.15
you're likely over the course of your

372.57 --> 380.04
life to be saving money on misery and um

378.15 --> 383.60999999999996
health care costs that's what I predict

380.04 --> 387.21000000000004
well I don't know of course specifically

383.61 --> 389.7
about this one yet I've only tested it

387.21 --> 392.76
or for a day but I'm pretty convinced

389.7 --> 395.21999999999997
that it will do as advertised as all the

392.76 --> 399.0
enforced our products so far have done

395.22 --> 402.24
and this is my method I'm I'm just

399.0 --> 405.57
saying no I I refuse

402.24 --> 411.36
to be part of the mainstream medical

405.57 --> 413.76
system with yeah that's all about

411.36 --> 417.389
symptoms and that's not about the

413.76 --> 421.74
holistic approach and just let myself be

417.389 --> 424.23
degraded until my symptoms are not

421.74 --> 428.25
stable enough so that yeah I'd have to

424.23 --> 430.65000000000003
be subjected to surgery and all kinds of

428.25 --> 433.8
medical procedures and crap until I'm

430.65 --> 436.67999999999995
just it's half dead corpse in the body

433.8 --> 439.02000000000004
with breathing equipment because that is

436.68 --> 443.22
the future if you trust the medical

439.02 --> 447.33
system it is so and I'm never gonna do

443.22 --> 450.36
that so yeah pretty much

447.33 --> 455.49
declaring it publicly look if I have a

450.36 --> 457.88
real issue or a more more pressing issue

455.49 --> 461.04
than just regular little pains or

457.88 --> 463.83
psychosomatic issues and doctors will

461.04 --> 466.55
tell me or you have to do this so you

463.83 --> 469.46999999999997
can take the risk or you might die is

466.55 --> 474.44
picture blah blah I'll say yeah you know

469.47 --> 480.41900000000004
what I'd rather die in horrible agony

474.44 --> 484.11
suffering then actually surrender to the

480.419 --> 487.08
allopathic medical system I really do

484.11 --> 491.24
not that it's necessary because as long

487.08 --> 496.10999999999996
as I have a consciousness to think and

491.24 --> 498.72
muscles to move I will probably be able

496.11 --> 500.76
to just fix myself up no matter the

498.72 --> 504.03000000000003
conditions that I come in that I bump

500.76 --> 506.49
into that I contract I will be able to

504.03 --> 514.1899999999999
take care of them and survive and thrive

506.49 --> 514.19
as I have so far so yeah

515.68 --> 533.89
little health wrens yeah the diet is a

531.08 --> 538.94
very important in the enteric question

533.89 --> 542.33
but supplements can be awesome

538.94 --> 548.0300000000001
the issue with supplements is if you eat

542.33 --> 551.33
shitty crappy snack food and just

548.03 --> 555.41
regular chemical Laden chips and all

551.33 --> 557.69
that junk junk food yeah you'll need

555.41 --> 560.66
some supplements just to survive that

557.69 --> 563.21
and not turn into a bloated fat [ __ ]

560.66 --> 564.53
yeah that's literally what happens when

563.21 --> 569.0300000000001
you do that sorry

564.53 --> 571.99
not trying to be mean that's just the

569.03 --> 576.7099999999999
freaking reality that's why there's

571.99 --> 579.65
stupid fat people in like not super

576.71 --> 580.9300000000001
young because that is what they eat that

579.65 --> 586.04
is what you turn into

580.93 --> 588.65
sorry it's just the freakin reality so

586.04 --> 590.7199999999999
yeah supplements aren't literally gonna

588.65 --> 594.17
help you out of that you'll have to

590.72 --> 596.96
change your diet but supplements will

594.17 --> 600.29
make changing your diet a lot easier and

596.96 --> 604.7
it'll help to restore a lot of the

600.29 --> 609.77
damage a lot quicker when you do change

604.7 --> 613.5500000000001
your diet and once you've changed your

609.77 --> 615.8299999999999
diet it will be such a massive plus one

613.55 --> 617.93
of the things about eating healthy and

615.83 --> 620.6
combining it with supplements is that if

617.93 --> 624.26
you apply the supplements properly and

620.6 --> 627.2
don't take it excessively or just become

624.26 --> 629.66
too lean on it like every single day

627.2 --> 630.08
there's always as long as you don't do

629.66 --> 634.0699999999999
that

630.08 --> 639.25
either of those things then it can

634.07 --> 642.9200000000001
actually save you money money on food

639.25 --> 646.16
because hey if it is super concentrated

642.92 --> 647.49
super concentrated food basically these

646.16 --> 652.0799999999999
supplements

647.49 --> 654.87
yeah that that'll save your body the

652.08 --> 657.75
need to get some of those nutrition's

654.87 --> 660.99
out of food so yeah it's just gonna be

657.75 --> 663.66
added on to it I experienced this like

660.99 --> 665.99
last year where I was taking a lot of

663.66 --> 671.13
new supplements and I just noticed that

665.99 --> 673.89
like every two days I just skipped

671.13 --> 676.5
dinner because I just wasn't hungry I

673.89 --> 678.36
just didn't need it and I had no

676.5 --> 680.55
repercussions whatsoever

678.36 --> 683.49
because I was taking all these

680.55 --> 686.55
supplements and just they don't need as

683.49 --> 689.64
much nutrition from food when you take a

686.55 --> 694.709
lot of them so not recommended though

689.64 --> 697.4399999999999
that one would completely switch out on

694.709 --> 699.9799999999999
a regular food with all supplements I

697.44 --> 703.08
don't know if that's a really smart idea

699.98 --> 707.64
there are still some basic nutritions

703.08 --> 709.98
that yeah that are on average just best

707.64 --> 720.23
taken out of regular food also you don't

709.98 --> 727.64
want your yeah you don't want your guts

720.23 --> 730.2
to stop being used to processing food or

727.64 --> 731.31
yeah once you do start eating food it

730.2 --> 732.3900000000001
might have a lot of trouble with it

731.31 --> 736.9799999999999
which is annoying

732.39 --> 741.99
although yeah one could go completely to

736.98 --> 743.6700000000001
the other side and that is become a

741.99 --> 747.45
breath terian and just stop eating

743.67 --> 751.52
altogether yeah people gonna be

747.45 --> 754.8000000000001
triggered now and yeah it is a thing

751.52 --> 757.3199999999999
yeah but part of it is just basically

754.8 --> 762.54
stop eating and yeah your intestines

757.32 --> 766.37
will stop processing food and it'll work

762.54 --> 769.23
differently and yeah now all your

766.37 --> 772.5600000000001
presuppositional thinking in accepting

769.23 --> 778.3100000000001
that we are a machine and we must have

772.56 --> 780.899
food by our guts and by our metabolism

778.31 --> 784.6189999999999
to process the end

780.899 --> 788.189
G from at like a like a car a biological

784.619 --> 791.759
car needing fuel to run yeah that

788.189 --> 794.67
assumption it's just one system it's

791.759 --> 798.99
just one system in the body and life

794.67 --> 804.66
especially human life is unbelievably

798.99 --> 807.029
and fathom ibly resilient and yeah our

804.66 --> 811.1
culture just like with so many other

807.029 --> 818.1
things that we deal with has taught us

811.1 --> 821.519
not to not to realize that not to accept

818.1 --> 823.22
that we are miraculous beings that can

821.519 --> 826.199
do all kinds of things and

823.22 --> 829.1890000000001
breatharianism is also act especially

826.199 --> 833.459
not accepted it is unacceptable

829.189 --> 837.1189999999999
dangerous so you could die and oh my God

833.459 --> 839.699
we're so we're such a doctor for soul

837.119 --> 841.9200000000001
care we care so much that we're not

839.699 --> 843.959
gonna allow you to do this thing I'd

841.92 --> 846.4699999999999
rather just kidnap you and put you in

843.959 --> 849.17
the hospital and force-feed you ooh

846.47 --> 853.4100000000001
thank you doctor for being so

849.17 --> 855.8389999999999
responsible well screw you let these

853.41 --> 856.709
people do what they do it's a process to

855.839 --> 858.72
figure it out

856.709 --> 860.429
breatharianism is not something you're

858.72 --> 863.73
going to do from one day to the next you

860.429 --> 866.61
have to the biggest part is the mental

863.73 --> 868.9490000000001
state the mental preparation and the

866.61 --> 872.97
mindset the entire consciousness mindset

868.949 --> 874.529
needs to be adapted in order to allow

872.97 --> 880.2900000000001
that to happen

874.529 --> 882.99
allow the material feeding the manna as

880.29 --> 889.799
they call it the the sweet sensation at

882.99 --> 893.1
the bottom of your mouth to allow that

889.799 --> 897.35
to manifest it is a thing that's real

893.1 --> 900.48
yeah yeah get over it it's freakin real

897.35 --> 903.749
okay doesn't mean that you should do

900.48 --> 908.04
that or we are must do this or we're do

903.749 --> 911.1890000000001
no it is possible it is there it's gonna

908.04 --> 913.829
be ridiculed but it works so it's all up

911.189 --> 914.579
to you what you're going to do with that

913.829 --> 917.399
knowledge

914.579 --> 920.0089999999999
I doubt that knowledge could be used for

917.399 --> 920.579
the detriment of anything yeah stop

920.009 --> 923.069
eating

920.579 --> 924.569
it could be betterment of one individual

923.069 --> 927.059
if they're not gonna do it right and if

924.569 --> 928.799
they're gonna be stubborn and you know

927.059 --> 932.9699999999999
how that goes anybody can screw

928.799 --> 933.509
themselves over if they yeah anybody can

932.97 --> 935.9390000000001
do that

933.509 --> 940.23
it's not nothing special you need for

935.939 --> 943.019
that so yeah that was me ranting on

940.23 --> 945.389
about breatharianism happened to come up

943.019 --> 949.559
in some articles and my father brought

945.389 --> 952.559
it up as a subject out for two years ago

949.559 --> 953.519
because he's also been looking into that

952.559 --> 957.11
how it works

953.519 --> 960.149
and he's interested in attempting it and

957.11 --> 963.839
I think he can absolutely do he does

960.149 --> 966.799
have the perfect mindset for it but I

963.839 --> 973.5290000000001
don't I could probably do it partially

966.799 --> 981.5889999999999
like half and half but it's very hard

973.529 --> 985.199
for me to adapt to such a thing and

981.589 --> 987.149
maybe maybe at some point I don't know

985.199 --> 989.8
but for now no I'm good just gonna be

987.149 --> 992.86
eating and see

989.8 --> 992.8599999999999
[Music]

1003.2 --> 1011.5600000000001
right and fasting yep

1006.82 --> 1018.74
fasting is a good mental bullock

1011.56 --> 1022.67
regenerative discipline and cultures all

1018.74 --> 1025.25
over the world applied all shamanic

1022.67 --> 1028.549
traditions apply fasting all of them

1025.25 --> 1030.89
without a single exception worldwide all

1028.549 --> 1034.189
human cultures all right that's for a

1030.89 --> 1037.0
good reason because it really works it

1034.189 --> 1041.959
does is it basically shuts down the

1037.0 --> 1044.24
digestion track activity allowing the

1041.959 --> 1046.3700000000001
rest of the body in your blood vessels

1044.24 --> 1049.34
absorbing all these nutrition's that

1046.37 --> 1053.2099999999998
derive from it to do their job perfectly

1049.34 --> 1055.37
without any interference of different

1053.21 --> 1060.02
type of metabolic process that are

1055.37 --> 1066.61
specifically tied into the consumption

1060.02 --> 1071.48
or did yummy my life is just anyway

1066.61 --> 1075.4399999999998
if your digestion system it has stopped

1071.48 --> 1078.91
or is going into sleep mode because

1075.44 --> 1083.02
there's no food going through it then

1078.91 --> 1087.3200000000002
the rest of your cellular systems will

1083.02 --> 1090.049
automatically use the opportunity to

1087.32 --> 1093.76
clean up to do some serious local

1090.049 --> 1096.77
cellular housekeeping everywhere to dump

1093.76 --> 1099.3799999999999
certain taxes to repair certain things

1096.77 --> 1103.34
that it would normally not have the

1099.38 --> 1106.25
opportunity to do because of the

1103.34 --> 1107.87
digestive system processes and

1106.25 --> 1110.179
everything that comes with it with the

1107.87 --> 1110.78
typical substances that are in your

1110.179 --> 1113.45
blood

1110.78 --> 1115.57
while that process is going and if that

1113.45 --> 1120.1000000000001
process stops then all these other

1115.57 --> 1123.6789999999999
interfering elements will not be there

1120.1 --> 1124.51
allowing that cellular transformation to

1123.679 --> 1128.929
take place

1124.51 --> 1133.04
fasting yes it works works for a reason

1128.929 --> 1136.3600000000001
and it works really well so yeah that's

1133.04 --> 1136.36
just fasting that's just

1136.93 --> 1142.24
partially the same concept as birthed

1139.58 --> 1146.51
Arianism but in a temporary setting

1142.24 --> 1150.71
because yeah breatharianism is pretty

1146.51 --> 1154.46
much the same effect but with some extra

1150.71 --> 1157.43
things added on it is basically you stay

1154.46 --> 1160.8400000000001
there and you need to trigger the mana

1157.43 --> 1166.0900000000001
effect and all that it is it is not

1160.84 --> 1168.77
really so straightforward and easy but

1166.09 --> 1171.8899999999999
fasting is release anyone can do it

1168.77 --> 1175.19
anyone with just the shred of discipline

1171.89 --> 1177.92
a little kid like a really little kid

1175.19 --> 1180.77
could probably not doing very well but I

1177.92 --> 1184.6100000000001
think that anybody like above 10 could

1180.77 --> 1194.6299999999999
muster the discipline to do it if they

1184.61 --> 1197.4499999999998
recognize the use for it so anyway know

1194.63 --> 1199.13
this is my breakfast I can even and get

1197.45 --> 1201.52
a chance to eat it yet before the show

1199.13 --> 1201.5200000000002
started

1211.49 --> 1214.49
right

1214.83 --> 1218.109
[Music]

1224.429 --> 1227.429
mmm

1231.52 --> 1242.22
Oh Eric you little government energy

1237.72 --> 1242.22
don't like Alex juice Oh

1242.52 --> 1251.11
organization is so terrible because it

1246.01 --> 1254.89
doesn't hate government I'm sad it's

1251.11 --> 1256.36
actually for some kind of limited

1254.89 --> 1259.6000000000001
government that makes sense in this

1256.36 --> 1262.59
nationalist then so bad yeah I'm gonna

1259.6 --> 1270.34
buy their products forever

1262.59 --> 1274.3
so yeah you just sit tight and don't buy

1270.34 --> 1276.1599999999999
anything associated with any kind of non

1274.3 --> 1280.51
total absolute anarchist organization

1276.16 --> 1282.01
and you enjoy that and I'm gonna get the

1280.51 --> 1284.22
best products in the world in the

1282.01 --> 1284.22
meantime

1302.669 --> 1309.8590000000002
right yeah drinking waters also good

1327.07 --> 1329.6399999999999
yeah

1333.59 --> 1339.32
alright David reads asking questions

1336.11 --> 1343.28
yeah if you're fasting what can you eat

1339.32 --> 1349.7
well simple nothing absolutely nothing

1343.28 --> 1354.1399999999999
solid good drink some green tea some

1349.7 --> 1358.64
water that's it no coffee no things like

1354.14 --> 1363.94
sugar nothing

1358.64 --> 1369.92
that's fasting it's just water maybe a

1363.94 --> 1373.99
little bit of herb extract like tea but

1369.92 --> 1373.99
none of the aggressive sort that's it

1374.6 --> 1379.0
that's what you need otherwise it's not

1377.179 --> 1381.2
gonna be fasting you're just gonna be

1379.0 --> 1383.409
eating very little it's not the same

1381.2 --> 1386.769
thing

1383.409 --> 1386.769
hello Eric

1390.04 --> 1403.96
hello you're on mute hey what's up even

1400.21 --> 1405.31

1408.64 --> 1417.22
you hear me yeah yeah good topic mm-hmm

1415.03 --> 1419.71
sorry I had to pick on your Alex Jones

1417.22 --> 1424.03
stuff I just hate that guy good no

1419.71 --> 1425.8
that's fine I love him yeah and they

1424.03 --> 1427.99
know there's so much wrong about him

1425.8 --> 1430.99
especially his inner character there is

1427.99 --> 1434.38
some things terribly wrong with that guy

1430.99 --> 1436.48
I don't give a [ __ ] because I love him

1434.38 --> 1441.13
and I love his products and I love his

1436.48 --> 1443.92
concept in this age okay I just don't

1441.13 --> 1446.6200000000001
everything has a place and a purpose and

1443.92 --> 1449.8200000000002
he stole Isis employees is better than

1446.62 --> 1453.25
the most people in the world right now

1449.82 --> 1457.6899999999998
okay got you hey listen I'm not saying

1453.25 --> 1458.94
that that the guy doesn't offer any

1457.69 --> 1462.7
[Music]

1458.94 --> 1464.6200000000001
valid information or suggesting you know

1462.7 --> 1467.3500000000001
good behaviors and things like that

1464.62 --> 1469.6599999999999
there's a lot of that I just what the

1467.35 --> 1472.24
stuffy he gate keeps is just some of the

1469.66 --> 1475.42
biggest problems but whatever well it's

1472.24 --> 1477.85
what you mean like every single other

1475.42 --> 1480.19
media outlet in the entire world

1477.85 --> 1482.77
so you're gonna singling I hear now

1480.19 --> 1486.01
you're gonna single him out for doing

1482.77 --> 1491.35
the exact same all other media outlets

1486.01 --> 1498.31
in the entire world do really well then

1491.35 --> 1500.8
done rink enough well I can't resist

1498.31 --> 1501.82
responding properly so just so you know

1500.8 --> 1505.3
that's what happens

1501.82 --> 1512.35
aside from diet have you ever looked

1505.3 --> 1514.45
into adjusting sleep cycles yeah duh of

1512.35 --> 1516.2199999999998
course it makes mm matters a lot I

1514.45 --> 1519.25
forget that I forget the term for it but

1516.22 --> 1523.3600000000001
there's basically a a mode where you can

1519.25 --> 1523.63
get down to about two hours a day but

1523.36 --> 1526.75
you

1523.63 --> 1528.67
space it out like every every 2 or 3

1526.75 --> 1530.2
hours you do just 15 minutes and people

1528.67 --> 1534.3100000000002
just can't imagine that they can

1530.2 --> 1537.52
actually get into a REM sleep within 15

1534.31 --> 1539.59
minutes but you can actually well you

1537.52 --> 1543.01
can do it when you have sleep problems

1539.59 --> 1547.8999999999999
in this paradise I mean seriously

1543.01 --> 1549.8799999999999
problems so many and I just I don't get

1547.9 --> 1551.68
it I mean I go through phases especially

1549.88 --> 1555.25
when winter comes worth my sleep gets my

1551.68 --> 1556.8700000000001
stuff but generally you know it's I have

1555.25 --> 1558.49
no problem falling asleep that's a

1556.87 --> 1560.7399999999998
serious health issue and then what do

1558.49 --> 1562.8700000000001
they do they give you both take some

1560.74 --> 1566.38
pharmaceuticals just know you added ya

1562.87 --> 1569.9499999999998
know but it's also a personal cultural

1566.38 --> 1572.8300000000002
problem with a lot of people it's stress

1569.95 --> 1575.14
management and it is discipline yeah

1572.83 --> 1578.08
indeed it's a no combination of these

1575.14 --> 1581.26
two being poorly that is what typically

1578.08 --> 1583.48
makes individuals just not be able to

1581.26 --> 1585.8799999999999
properly sleep and start abusing sleep

1583.48 --> 1590.47
medication so get it done which

1585.88 --> 1592.65
aggravates it even more and it's funny

1590.47 --> 1595.3600000000001
it's world worldwide they have this

1592.65 --> 1596.6200000000001
human beings need eight hours of sleep

1595.36 --> 1599.26
like it doesn't matter where you go I

1596.62 --> 1601.4799999999998
mean in the West and Asia yeah eight up

1599.26 --> 1603.85
but that's true I didn't tell people you

1601.48 --> 1606.1
don't recognize that the more sleep the

1603.85 --> 1609.58
body gets the more you want generally

1606.1 --> 1612.04
speaking yeah like I thought yeah yeah

1609.58 --> 1614.32
but you know you knew no what happens

1612.04 --> 1616.72
during sleep right more than just the

1614.32 --> 1619.6299999999999
REM there's all kinds of metabolic

1616.72 --> 1622.84
processes that do their thing and long

1619.63 --> 1626.0500000000002
sleep is healthy it's just not healthy

1622.84 --> 1629.23
when you do it all the time you need to

1626.05 --> 1632.3799999999999
counterbalance life activity for it so

1629.23 --> 1635.29
long sleep is really good if you have a

1632.38 --> 1637.69
massively physically active day very

1635.29 --> 1641.32
long if you're like eight hour 10-hour

1637.69 --> 1643.45
workday yeah you are gonna need that six

1641.32 --> 1646.09
to eight hours sleep absolutely or you

1643.45 --> 1649.54
gonna break but if you're just a regular

1646.09 --> 1652.57
guy not doing a lot of things and you

1649.54 --> 1656.11
don't need that much sleep no I know

1652.57 --> 1656.96
it's just I mean you know you can take

1656.11 --> 1659.06
supplements

1656.96 --> 1663.77
I don't find much need but I you know a

1659.06 --> 1666.6799999999998
good sleep pattern decent diet inactive

1663.77 --> 1669.56
you don't mean to join a gym I spend

1666.68 --> 1670.49
hundreds of dollars to go on up yeah I

1669.56 --> 1673.7
know I know

1670.49 --> 1678.25
yeah you know what I do you know I walk

1673.7 --> 1682.3300000000002
the stairs every day I Drive my bicycle

1678.25 --> 1686.69
above-average temple that's my sport and

1682.33 --> 1689.27
it works that's pretty much all you need

1686.69 --> 1690.71
stop driving a car everywhere I mean I

1689.27 --> 1692.78
know an even having car

1690.71 --> 1694.8500000000001
I mean you see what's going on like with

1692.78 --> 1697.28
this door - that gym does people are too

1694.85 --> 1698.54
lazy to even walk it go to it to drive

1697.28 --> 1704.27
to McDonald's and go through the

1698.54 --> 1706.9099999999999
drive-thru now that God iswhat you've

1704.27 --> 1708.8899999999999
all seen that movie what is it um set

1706.91 --> 1713.68
future movie where everyone's all really

1708.89 --> 1713.68
dumb idiocracy or something which one

1713.74 --> 1725.95
your movie where everyone's really dumb

1716.48 --> 1725.95
are you talking about fright

1725.98 --> 1730.49
Futurama that's fry that's a [ __ ] from

1729.08 --> 1732.56
the past right but the guy in the

1730.49 --> 1736.07
producer or the Creator that I think did

1732.56 --> 1738.2
this movie called idiocracy right I know

1736.07 --> 1740.24
that's pretty much where we're headed

1738.2 --> 1742.64
seriously that's the guy who made beef

1740.24 --> 1744.6200000000001
some butt head as well yeah yeah pretty

1742.64 --> 1749.18
sure Mike judge it like yeah my judge

1744.62 --> 1752.59
right I could be wrong but it was pretty

1749.18 --> 1755.9
much a mirror of like like Futurama just

1752.59 --> 1757.4599999999998
but that movie was brilliant and that's

1755.9 --> 1761.5700000000002
pretty much where we're going seriously

1757.46 --> 1763.04
you gotta get no no absolutely not it

1761.57 --> 1770.72
only appears that way on the surface

1763.04 --> 1773.24
thank God no no if things are completely

1770.72 --> 1778.1000000000001
ridiculous and trashy in idiotic that's

1773.24 --> 1783.1
only because it is set to a die down

1778.1 --> 1786.98
policy the long term global world

1783.1 --> 1788.8999999999999
corporate plan for a region will be for

1786.98 --> 1790.83
it to break down as much as possible

1788.9 --> 1793.2
because a giant

1790.83 --> 1795.33
overhaul is planned in the future where

1793.2 --> 1797.3700000000001
everything is completely reconstructed

1795.33 --> 1799.9499999999998
from scratch but then the only way to

1797.37 --> 1802.3799999999999
accomplish this on the long run is to

1799.95 --> 1804.539
first completely destroy it so there

1802.38 --> 1806.6100000000001
will be no objections for the

1804.539 --> 1809.07
transformation plan does the things are

1806.61 --> 1811.9189999999999
fixed and nice then people don't will

1809.07 --> 1813.6589999999999
they will not allow a radical

1811.919 --> 1816.0800000000002
transformation because they're satisfied

1813.659 --> 1818.159
with the region that's what happens

1816.08 --> 1819.57
that's what happened that's what

1818.159 --> 1823.2890000000002
happening in California

1819.57 --> 1836.12
big big transformative plans for the

1823.289 --> 1844.35
very long run what are you talking about

1836.12 --> 1845.82
nobody that's what you think that's what

1844.35 --> 1849.09
you think that's what you religiously

1845.82 --> 1852.09
personally believe and that's what you

1849.09 --> 1855.269
must accept in order for you to remain

1852.09 --> 1857.639
mentally stable because you have so much

1855.269 --> 1860.34
value invested in that concept that you

1857.639 --> 1862.3799999999999
can't allow yourself to realize that you

1860.34 --> 1873.029
might not be as in control as you would

1862.38 --> 1875.63
like to be already so everything I

1873.029 --> 1879.149
expressed just now that's actually

1875.63 --> 1882.0590000000002
promoting that is or am I just pointing

1879.149 --> 1884.1589999999999
out how it's really there what is

1882.059 --> 1886.1689999999999
happening that it's not political that's

1884.159 --> 1889.529
not a political idea that's just a

1886.169 --> 1893.3090000000002
conclusion of how things are working how

1889.529 --> 1895.95
things are working and are done not that

1893.309 --> 1904.039
I agree with those things but that is

1895.95 --> 1908.82
how it is done I see it I see it

1904.039 --> 1913.26
see that it I can only work in certain

1908.82 --> 1915.45
ways so ya can imagine all kinds of wild

1913.26 --> 1918.21
and realistic things to be the cause of

1915.45 --> 1919.98
that or you could just be pragmatic and

1918.21 --> 1923.6200000000001
see look this is what's going on this is

1919.98 --> 1925.24
what they're doing and that's why

1923.62 --> 1927.1
I know what you're saying and I can see

1925.24 --> 1929.59
that I can see that agenda I can see it

1927.1 --> 1933.009
being tried I don't think it's gonna

1929.59 --> 1935.4089999999999
manifest it is manifesting okay some of

1933.009 --> 1939.009
it no look but even the California thing

1935.409 --> 1940.8700000000001
is a long-term plan and it's there's

1939.009 --> 1943.3890000000001
friction right now so it's not gonna be

1940.87 --> 1946.4499999999998
so straightforward but that is how it

1943.389 --> 1949.299
was set up that's how they do things

1946.45 --> 1951.669
it's how they do things everywhere is

1949.299 --> 1955.559
how they do things in Europe in the

1951.669 --> 1959.769
Netherlands they let certain reaches

1955.559 --> 1963.22
regions dilapidate beyond all reason

1959.769 --> 1965.35
abilities so that at some point they can

1963.22 --> 1968.3500000000001
certainly do a giant overhaul with a

1965.35 --> 1971.139
high-tech newly plan thing and if they

1968.35 --> 1974.83
hadn't let that region dilapidate on

1971.139 --> 1977.9799999999998
purpose for a long time despite all the

1974.83 --> 1990.61
complaints they would never be able to

1977.98 --> 1992.47
get that done that's how it works it

1990.61 --> 1995.279
does it's part of what government does

1992.47 --> 2001.71
that's why you love it so much it is

1995.279 --> 2003.869
what it is it's what they do it's their

2001.71 --> 2007.529
strategy it's the only thing you can get

2003.869 --> 2017.039
things done as a government hey

2007.529 --> 2026.249
chocolate yeah buddy you just hear me

2017.039 --> 2040.009

2091.43 --> 2099.0499999999997
need out of just food you know even

2096.05 --> 2102.8900000000003

2099.05 --> 2106.07
really difficult you have to be you have

2102.89 --> 2108.65
to be like a high-class cook for

2106.07 --> 2111.02
yourself which is like a part-time job

2108.65 --> 2113.2400000000002
in order to get that done

2111.02 --> 2114.86
no that's true but why does nobody talk

2113.24 --> 2117.14
about how much we actually need our

2114.86 --> 2120.29
bodies of skin to be exposed to Sun

2117.14 --> 2121.94
sunlight is is and but people sit in

2120.29 --> 2123.71
offices they sit in their cars with

2121.94 --> 2126.4700000000003
their aircon they go they live in North

2123.71 --> 2128.93
Dakota where you know there's it's just

2126.47 --> 2132.0499999999997
yeah you better take some up b12 because

2128.93 --> 2132.74
now it's like the industry is trying to

2132.05 --> 2141.3700000000003
scare people

2132.74 --> 2144.5899999999997
yeah oh please please let them you know

2141.37 --> 2146.96
everybody take your sunscreen bath

2144.59 --> 2150.1400000000003
drowning it swallow some of it in the

2146.96 --> 2154.52
process and please avoid the Sun at all

2150.14 --> 2157.6099999999997
cost your entire life and leave it I'll

2154.52 --> 2159.11
be sitting there in that Sun I don't

2157.61 --> 2173.4500000000003
want to sit in the Sun but then people

2159.11 --> 2175.25
are now going into tanning salons if you

2173.45 --> 2177.02
if you if you're in the body building I

2175.25 --> 2178.42
guess you need to be in a gym but if

2177.02 --> 2182.27
you're just some regular nine-to-five

2178.42 --> 2182.599
worker seriously you're gonna go in pay

2182.27 --> 2185.69
money

2182.599 --> 2187.7000000000003
to walk on a thing I just I've never got

2185.69 --> 2190.64
that whole health health fitness club

2187.7 --> 2193.999
crap I just laugh at all that crap like

2190.64 --> 2196.97
wow walk to work I don't know it's the

2193.999 --> 2200.0589999999997
mindset no Eric you don't get it because

2196.97 --> 2204.3489999999997
you don't get the average mindset of the

2200.059 --> 2206.7200000000003
office worker these people are not very

2204.349 --> 2209.239
creative when it comes to their life

2206.72 --> 2212.45
discipline and structure so they just

2209.239 --> 2214.479
want the structure they want to know

2212.45 --> 2218.21
exactly what they're going to be doing

2214.479 --> 2220.97
exactly for a long time to come and how

2218.21 --> 2225.559
and that's what they like so they do

2220.97 --> 2227.66
stupid almost [ __ ] [ __ ] but as long

2225.559 --> 2229.0690000000004
as you can do it disciplined and they

2227.66 --> 2231.14
know it's going to yield some results

2229.069 --> 2245.799
then they're all right looking like

2231.14 --> 2250.16
complete asses the rest of their life oh

2245.799 --> 2252.38
yeah sure of course social contacts yeah

2250.16 --> 2258.979
sure but that's like yeah that's at the

2252.38 --> 2263.029
sports club as well so you know at the

2258.979 --> 2265.609
gym of course every every location where

2263.029 --> 2279.89
there's gonna be people is a new

2265.609 --> 2282.319
opportunity to get to know people so I'm

2279.89 --> 2296.499
chocolate saying I don't want to know

2282.319 --> 2298.64
you go there to be social like people

2296.499 --> 2303.2
getting pretty to go to the gym like

2298.64 --> 2305.3289999999997
that's ridiculous yeah hey some people

2303.2 --> 2308.3289999999997
who make them somewhere when they go

2305.329 --> 2311.059
there make up to go to the gym well some

2308.329 --> 2313.279
people put on fancy clothes and hats and

2311.059 --> 2315.259
makeup when they go to church others do

2313.279 --> 2316.25
it for gym it's all at the social

2315.259 --> 2318.56
occasion

2316.25 --> 2320.33
your entire plan is not sweat when

2318.56 --> 2324.5
you're at church you wouldn't go to

2320.33 --> 2326.63
church but you'll want to be spiritual

2324.5 --> 2328.73
and modest and not like a freaking

2326.63 --> 2332.02
peacock actually so it's the same kind

2328.73 --> 2332.02
of ridic ridiculousness

2333.17 --> 2341.96
[Music]

2336.19 --> 2361.64
people do really silly stuff for social

2341.96 --> 2364.88
reasoning social fishing I'm gonna get

2361.64 --> 2368.33
some tea you keep you guys you know what

2364.88 --> 2370.52
is a what is a health club membership

2368.33 --> 2372.95
cost in New York City these days but for

2370.52 --> 2375.46
a year it's got to be what a be 1,500

2372.95 --> 2385.21
2,000 3,000 bucks or something

2375.46 --> 2391.63
Jesus the wrong person I had a

2385.21 --> 2391.63
membership years ago I really like that

2394.81 --> 2401.57
just working out myself in my house yeah

2398.48 --> 2403.28
that's when I was lifting weights and

2401.57 --> 2405.44
stuff I was okay man you don't need much

2403.28 --> 2406.73
you know I had a crowbar bench when I

2405.44 --> 2408.05
would but then I got rid of the bench

2406.73 --> 2410.21
because I I didn't really want to be a

2408.05 --> 2413.02
bodybuilder I think the you know the

2410.21 --> 2418.28
curling bar is enough

2413.02 --> 2424.61
sit-ups want to be like big like that

2418.28 --> 2429.17
they want to be like Arnold yeah that

2424.61 --> 2431.4500000000003
was my goal so yeah and I pretty much

2429.17 --> 2433.4300000000003
subpoena at some point that's just

2431.45 --> 2437.75
pretty awesome good I used to be pretty

2433.43 --> 2439.3999999999996
chubby when I was a kid really yeah you

2437.75 --> 2443.51
look pretty fit now look like you got a

2439.4 --> 2445.57
nice fit yeah not bulky you're fit I

2443.51 --> 2445.57
guess

2449.75 --> 2453.64
what my avatar looks like right now so

2456.28 --> 2460.13
the thing is but you must have never

2458.33 --> 2461.5699999999997
gotten too fat like some America me

2460.13 --> 2463.4300000000003
being in New York you did a lot of

2461.57 --> 2465.26
walking your whole life likes go into

2463.43 --> 2469.3399999999997
the subways and stuff like that right

2465.26 --> 2473.26
and that alone is yeah on top of that

2469.34 --> 2473.26
like I mean every job that I've ever had

2473.8 --> 2477.65
yes it's pretty hard to get fat if you

2476.6 --> 2497.27
live in New York City

2477.65 --> 2500.4500000000003
oh hey guys how are you hey Cindy I i

2497.27 --> 2504.28
catch another conversation about the

2500.45 --> 2504.2799999999997
fitness clubs and so on

2511.37 --> 2517.67
I'd rather just write the bicycle

2515.57 --> 2521.54
somewhere I mean Zurich is kinda Haley

2517.67 --> 2524.21
so it's sometimes it's kinda an effort

2521.54 --> 2528.35
to go to go anywhere with the bicycle so

2524.21 --> 2531.38
it's kind of heated in in the winter I

2528.35 --> 2536.3199999999997
kinda do nothing I just chill and you

2531.38 --> 2540.1400000000003
know but but the fun thing about this

2536.32 --> 2545.3
stuff is I is something more ridiculous

2540.14 --> 2550.19
than those fitness clubs I bought the I

2545.3 --> 2552.11
bought VR glasses like two years ago or

2550.19 --> 2553.4
one 1/2 years ago from a friend who

2552.11 --> 2555.71
didn't need them anymore

2553.4 --> 2558.44
so he kinda gave me a discount and then

2555.71 --> 2560.12
I didn't use them for a lot of time and

2558.44 --> 2563.14
then I looked again into it and there

2560.12 --> 2567.91
was really what a walking simulator

2563.14 --> 2572.15
working in the park simulator and like

2567.91 --> 2576.35
like chalking simulator and tennis

2572.15 --> 2579.02
simulator like why why do people have to

2576.35 --> 2581.12
go into a virtual reality and do

2579.02 --> 2583.56
everything that just got to outside I

2581.12 --> 2589.0
was like

2583.56 --> 2591.4
Custer lonely really really lonely and I

2589.0 --> 2593.14
don't want to on the technology I'm sure

2591.4 --> 2595.15
there's some good applications of the

2593.14 --> 2597.73
arleigh and this idea that you just want

2595.15 --> 2600.9700000000003
to be in a climate-controlled safety of

2597.73 --> 2603.4
your your penthouse or your condo your

2600.97 --> 2606.22
house and you wonder why people get sick

2603.4 --> 2608.98
of everything every little German oh oh

2606.22 --> 2609.49
I have allergies like can't you need to

2608.98 --> 2611.44
go outside

2609.49 --> 2614.35
you need to have bacteria in your life

2611.44 --> 2619.9
you need to have that you can't be in

2614.35 --> 2622.93
climate control your whole life it is it

2619.9 --> 2624.55
gonna kill you literally I guess you

2622.93 --> 2626.47
just have to be in a sterile bubble for

2624.55 --> 2630.34
the rest of your life no no that's gonna

2626.47 --> 2632.98
kill you naturally so in the short run

2630.34 --> 2635.05
it seems like a solution but your immune

2632.98 --> 2637.39
system will only grow weaker over time

2635.05 --> 2644.05
because of this and it will kill you

2637.39 --> 2647.98
yeah so yeah a problem with a lot of

2644.05 --> 2650.02
those like hyper allergic people is the

2647.98 --> 2652.93
lack of exposure when they were young

2650.02 --> 2654.82
and sometimes it's this can never be

2652.93 --> 2657.43
fixed and that's horrifying

2654.82 --> 2659.86
oh yes but they got a vaccine damage all

2657.43 --> 2662.25
that [ __ ] and they're just terribly

2659.86 --> 2665.02
terribly weak enemies as you could

2662.25 --> 2669.51
keeping your kids from getting dirty and

2665.02 --> 2672.46
getting all that not that not exactly

2669.51 --> 2674.7400000000002
but sometimes they do get just hyper

2672.46 --> 2678.16
allergic from something like a vaccine

2674.74 --> 2680.95
and that's just terrible but it's

2678.16 --> 2683.5299999999997
practically in my opinion even better to

2680.95 --> 2685.75
them just risk it to actually let them

2683.53 --> 2689.3500000000004
still dig around in the dirt and still

2685.75 --> 2693.13
get some something out of it instead of

2689.35 --> 2695.2599999999998
just taking them away because of some

2693.13 --> 2712.78
temporary risk they need to get over

2695.26 --> 2717.21
that or seem so awesome so awesome bike

2712.78 --> 2717.21
you scream so far just had yeah

2718.32 --> 2724.36
just ask in scratch is not bad but if

2721.21 --> 2726.4900000000002
you like if it's actually pretty serious

2724.36 --> 2738.46
then you don't want that affected

2726.49 --> 2740.5
because it's still not helping just

2738.46 --> 2745.15
spray some colloidal silver over it done

2740.5 --> 2747.31
I mean of course if you see like the the

2745.15 --> 2749.05
wound is getting infected and so on and

2747.31 --> 2752.82
of course I have to get fan to buy of it

2749.05 --> 2752.82
because the kid might die but

2753.42 --> 2762.19
antibiotics no don't use antibiotics

2756.52 --> 2764.44
ever no it's not not say it's not

2762.19 --> 2767.17
effective and it's very detrimental for

2764.44 --> 2769.63
you you know all antibiotics damage your

2767.17 --> 2772.33
intestinal flora which reduces your

2769.63 --> 2773.8
overall immune system capacity so don't

2772.33 --> 2776.65
ever use it

2773.8 --> 2779.53
alright listen listen to me if if I had

2776.65 --> 2781.6600000000003
a kid and of course the kid falls down

2779.53 --> 2787.71
the bike bicycle whatever it gets a

2781.66 --> 2790.69
wound alright just clean it properly and

2787.71 --> 2792.9700000000003
digestive Lee but if the kid afterward

2790.69 --> 2795.19
starts to get severe and so on you have

2792.97 --> 2802.0
to give it antibiotic because it's an

2795.19 --> 2803.98
infection no no no no wrong you give him

2802.0 --> 2806.56
colloidal silver you give many other

2803.98 --> 2809.26
things there are options for you don't

2806.56 --> 2812.35
need to use freakin antibiotics and

2809.26 --> 2815.23
besides upon cleaning the wound and then

2812.35 --> 2818.41
eventually closing it if you just dump

2815.23 --> 2821.17
colloidal silver in there you don't have

2818.41 --> 2822.96
to be doesn't have to be a little just

2821.17 --> 2828.52
dump colloidal silver in there it's not

2822.96 --> 2830.59
gonna get infected happen I never had

2828.52 --> 2833.14
any side effects from any kind of

2830.59 --> 2835.96
antibiotic I just got it when I was

2833.14 --> 2839.16
after the dentist or so on right because

2835.96 --> 2842.8
of the infection after the operation and

2839.16 --> 2845.5299999999997
it works fine is a kid I almost never

2842.8 --> 2848.7400000000002
took antibiotic yet when I had to take

2845.53 --> 2850.36
it it was kind of useful and it isn't

2848.74 --> 2852.9399999999996
all men may in any way

2850.36 --> 2854.8900000000003
this is the nice thing about antibiotic

2852.94 --> 2858.15
the only problem with antibiotic is that

2854.89 --> 2860.47
there will be a lot of bacteria to get

2858.15 --> 2861.34
resistance towards it and then you can't

2860.47 --> 2864.8199999999997
kill them anymore

2861.34 --> 2868.75
hold on Zinder it destroys your

2864.82 --> 2872.26
intestinal flora that's an official

2868.75 --> 2876.82
side-effect okay you might not notice it

2872.26 --> 2880.3
but it does that okay and antibiotics is

2876.82 --> 2883.8700000000003
an artificially created medical product

2880.3 --> 2886.6000000000004
that was never ever necessary in the

2883.87 --> 2889.27
first place yeah it's an artificial

2886.6 --> 2892.21
creation an artificial product to create

2889.27 --> 2894.13
a market to squeeze people with when

2892.21 --> 2895.66
it's absolutely not necessary there's so

2894.13 --> 2897.94
many other things you can do colloidal

2895.66 --> 2901.81
silver silver of any kind

2897.94 --> 2902.67
pure silver so much better it's no side

2901.81 --> 2906.19
effects

2902.67 --> 2912.07
no building of resistance that seems

2906.19 --> 2916.66
right bacteria and viruses don't build

2912.07 --> 2918.73
immunity against silver ever well guess

2916.66 --> 2921.1
what was the mortality rate before

2918.73 --> 2926.23
antibiotic was invented because of

2921.1 --> 2928.81
single scratches or up again you know

2926.23 --> 2931.48
what actually did that what actually

2928.81 --> 2935.14
prevented it what what did it wrote

2931.48 --> 2937.87
about the trustor system getting a

2935.14 --> 2940.15
proper super insistence yeah and well

2937.87 --> 2942.8199999999997
the Romans had proper sewer system too

2940.15 --> 2945.61
and yet they also died from from a

2942.82 --> 2948.6400000000003
simple wound I mean of course a sewer

2945.61 --> 2952.06
system prevented diseases but where

2948.64 --> 2956.2
where they die from a simple wound in

2952.06 --> 2960.1
dusty countries like North Africa Arabia

2956.2 --> 2962.98
all there or in Europe in Europe you

2960.1 --> 2967.5099999999998
don't die from a scratchy scratchy wound

2962.98 --> 2970.96
you know that happens in countries where

2967.51 --> 2979.4500000000003
tetanus floats around in the dust and in

2970.96 --> 2980.07
jungles in the regional silver and all

2979.45 --> 2982.14
that

2980.07 --> 2983.8500000000004
and I definitely agree that there are

2982.14 --> 2988.17
other things that can be done besides

2983.85 --> 2991.23
taking antibiotics I wouldn't just out

2988.17 --> 2993.4500000000003
rights just not taking antibiotics

2991.23 --> 2997.29
well I wouldn't I mean as much as I

2993.45 --> 3000.02
don't trust I'll commit nicely as it is

2997.29 --> 3004.7599999999998
I think there are certain situations

3000.02 --> 3008.03
where it probably would be beneficial to

3004.76 --> 3009.6200000000003
take time instead of just especially

3008.03 --> 3011.15
because honestly well you're not a

3009.62 --> 3014.2
doctor you shouldn't just be telling

3011.15 --> 3020.3
people just don't take it you know I

3014.2 --> 3022.97
will tell them because I am allowed to

3020.3 --> 3025.01
do that because I'm not a doctor and I'm

3022.97 --> 3026.45
very glad that I can because it is the

3025.01 --> 3030.86
freaking truth and I recommend it

3026.45 --> 3043.6099999999997
everyone okay and you can sue me if that

3030.86 --> 3046.3700000000003
goes wrong because it wants dirty'

3043.61 --> 3049.85
around you I think you might maybe think

3046.37 --> 3053.0299999999997
about taking putting some antibiotics on

3049.85 --> 3063.14
an open wound or whatever and take no no

3053.03 --> 3065.51
no yeah yeah that's very very nice you

3063.14 --> 3067.8199999999997
guys are being really ridiculous and I'm

3065.51 --> 3071.48
starting to lose my patience here there

3067.82 --> 3073.61
are hundreds of things different you can

3071.48 --> 3075.89
do that have no negative side effects

3073.61 --> 3078.23
that will not build resistance in any

3075.89 --> 3080.69
kind of thing it is destroying that you

3078.23 --> 3083.09
can use that is a lot cheaper and it's

3080.69 --> 3086.17
been around forever colloidal silver is

3083.09 --> 3091.09
just one of these things antibiotics is

3086.17 --> 3094.28
[ __ ] it is [ __ ] and an official

3091.09 --> 3099.46
artificial creation to profit from

3094.28 --> 3102.4700000000003
humanity that is all no usual

3099.46 --> 3105.89
antibiotics but some poor person in

3102.47 --> 3107.39
Mumbai that's living in squalor doesn't

3105.89 --> 3111.0299999999997
know

3107.39 --> 3115.0499999999997
yeah well lack of knowledge will kill

3111.03 --> 3118.77
anything but but antibiotics is more

3115.05 --> 3121.32
expensive than any of these other things

3118.77 --> 3125.09
you can use that work much better that's

3121.32 --> 3143.55
the funny thing about it is dirt cheap

3125.09 --> 3146.61
dirt cheap antibiotics good very

3143.55 --> 3148.98
sensible as soon as I figured out that

3146.61 --> 3152.78
it is pure [ __ ] and every time I take it

3148.98 --> 3157.08
I become seriously sick and and ill and

3152.78 --> 3159.3300000000004
unstable metabolically for weeks after I

3157.08 --> 3161.87
figure that one out I just said no I'm

3159.33 --> 3166.98
never gonna take that crap anymore ever

3161.87 --> 3170.16
I'd rather suffer than take that I think

3166.98 --> 3173.55
it well I mean I'm going to have an

3170.16 --> 3176.0099999999998
operation like medical operation like

3173.55 --> 3178.4
next year or beginning of the next year

3176.01 --> 3181.26
and I will have to take it because

3178.4 --> 3185.9700000000003
otherwise I might die from the

3181.26 --> 3187.8
infections comm officer yeah yeah or

3185.97 --> 3190.2
you're gonna take colloidal silver and

3187.8 --> 3191.52
it's gonna be over very quickly and

3190.2 --> 3193.56
you're not gonna have negative side

3191.52 --> 3196.62
effects so I don't have you ever tried

3193.56 --> 3199.2599999999998
it simple have you ever no so you're

3196.62 --> 3201.75
gonna say no to this even though you've

3199.26 --> 3204.69
never even tried it before well I don't

3201.75 --> 3207.69
know I just like to listen to my medics

3204.69 --> 3209.9700000000003
when it comes to my life you like to

3207.69 --> 3212.55
listen to your doctors mmm well I know

3209.97 --> 3216.39
where that's all right no of course I'm

3212.55 --> 3218.79
not going to take I mean in America I

3216.39 --> 3220.5899999999997
know how a little bit of the medical

3218.79 --> 3223.32
system works they just if you are not

3220.59 --> 3232.8
polish it because they have an agreement

3223.32 --> 3236.5800000000004
with the pharmacy companies but I kinda

3232.8 --> 3239.1000000000004
I research antibiotics and I still don't

3236.58 --> 3240.109
believe that it hurts me but maybe I

3239.1 --> 3244.009
will

3240.109 --> 3247.16
don't do it and look up colloidal silver

3244.009 --> 3249.799
seriously along its colloidal silver is

3247.16 --> 3254.769
even used by the freakin military now

3249.799 --> 3254.769
because it works so well okay military

3255.369 --> 3267.079
that antibiotics is ineffective or just

3260.63 --> 3270.289
because it's expensive it's expensive it

3267.079 --> 3274.309
has negative side effects and it doesn't

3270.289 --> 3276.739
work well it only works in occasion if

3274.309 --> 3278.119
you take that these three factors okay

3276.739 --> 3281.18
you take colloidal silver

3278.119 --> 3286.2490000000003
hello they'll silver is cheap it has no

3281.18 --> 3293.18
side effects and it has a strange which

3286.249 --> 3294.6499999999996
works please I'm literally pointing here

3293.18 --> 3299.779
and my fingers and you're interrupting

3294.65 --> 3300.589
me okay that's just really rude I let me

3299.779 --> 3306.65
finish

3300.589 --> 3310.489
I finished now so cuz this is very

3306.65 --> 3312.65
important to me okay like I wanna get it

3310.489 --> 3316.4
on I'm just saying look I've used over

3312.65 --> 3318.739
before I get it like I as I started

3316.4 --> 3321.529
feeling a little a little sick I had

3318.739 --> 3322.279
some silver I took it and I actually

3321.529 --> 3324.769
felt better

3322.279 --> 3326.42
ya have to go to the doctor and I like

3324.769 --> 3332.7389999999996
that which I usually don't I'm not a

3326.42 --> 3336.289
doctor going guy you know it's alright I

3332.739 --> 3339.559
understand what you're saying no I want

3336.289 --> 3343.789
to be telling people absolutely not ever

3339.559 --> 3345.949
take it no no I will I absolutely will

3343.789 --> 3348.0190000000002
to never take it and always take an

3345.949 --> 3350.66
alternative that marks much better and

3348.019 --> 3353.3289999999997
has no side effects so yeah

3350.66 --> 3356.359
I will absolutely do that every single

3353.329 --> 3358.2490000000003
time forever as long as I'm allowed to

3356.359 --> 3362.3289999999997
another gonna be arrested for doing it I

3358.249 --> 3367.64
will do it so I'm gonna round out the

3362.329 --> 3370.009
show soon yeah I was a good talk I

3367.64 --> 3373.239
wanted to say something I forgot what it

3370.009 --> 3373.239
was damn it

3378.95 --> 3381.98
the funny thing is colloidal silver you

3380.66 --> 3384.89
can even make it yourself

3381.98 --> 3387.91
I had a device where I could make my own

3384.89 --> 3391.16
colloidal silver it cost a total of

3387.91 --> 3395.8689999999997
$1000 at the time and you can literally

3391.16 --> 3405.02
make lifetimes like hundreds of liters

3395.869 --> 3408.9100000000003
of colloidal silver it's a it's liquid

3405.02 --> 3411.41
in liquid it's just water with silver

3408.91 --> 3415.31
dissolved in that water on an atomic

3411.41 --> 3420.29
scale that's it it's you just drop it in

3415.31 --> 3422.69
your mouth now don't do we didn't just

3420.29 --> 3424.91
don't let it react with other things

3422.69 --> 3427.58
it's best to leave it as pure as

3424.91 --> 3429.74
possible and let that pure substance

3427.58 --> 3431.63
interact with your body you can apply

3429.74 --> 3435.56
topically on your skin you can take it

3431.63 --> 3437.54
digestive Lee yeah you can look you can

3435.56 --> 3440.66
even use it just to disinfect yourself

3437.54 --> 3443.3
like I do this sometimes you know when

3440.66 --> 3445.04
I've been I don't know cleaning the

3443.3 --> 3446.48
toilet or something something that's

3445.04 --> 3449.06
relatively disgusting what I do

3446.48 --> 3452.18
sometimes is just say look I'm gonna

3449.06 --> 3455.869
take this this pray with colloidal

3452.18 --> 3459.02
silver and it's just do this totally

3455.869 --> 3462.2000000000003
disinfected in a proper way in a real

3459.02 --> 3463.91
way that's not with some disgusting

3462.2 --> 3467.41
alcohol chemicals that's going to be

3463.91 --> 3470.42
absorbed by your skin and for you

3467.41 --> 3474.2
colloidal silver is such a great

3470.42 --> 3477.53
substance it's fantastic and I've known

3474.2 --> 3484.8489999999997
about it for over 12 years and been

3477.53 --> 3486.4700000000003
using it so yeah sorry this is a great

3484.849 --> 3488.75
show we would probably be able to go on

3486.47 --> 3491.18
for another half hour hour but I'm gonna
