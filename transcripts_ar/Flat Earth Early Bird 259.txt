[Music]

37.18 --> 44.51
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.91 --> 46.279999999999994
early-bird number 259 I'm your host

44.51 --> 48.08
Arwen and before we start to show up

46.28 --> 50.239000000000004
please don't forget it to share it on

48.08 --> 52.129
any platform you deem fit and also if

50.239 --> 53.839999999999996
you haven't already subscribed to my

52.129 --> 55.37
channel and hit the bell notification so

53.84 --> 57.650000000000006
you know when I'm going live which is

55.37 --> 60.11
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

57.65 --> 63.559
day also please support my channels

60.11 --> 69.38
through Super chats paypal patreon and

63.559 --> 75.32
my GoFundMe so let's see wait first the

69.38 --> 79.19
weather sorry for being a bit late yeah

75.32 --> 83.619
it's it's warm again although not as

79.19 --> 86.99
warm as the week before this but still

83.619 --> 91.19
yesterday was kind of cool compared to

86.99 --> 91.83999999999999
today it's very nice though clouds here

91.19 --> 96.71
and there

91.84 --> 101.39
nice breeze not too warm and a decent

96.71 --> 105.229
hot some but not like schooling or

101.39 --> 110.539
seething pot so great weather over here

105.229 --> 119.77
I got Tamara coffee with me mmm lemonade

110.539 --> 124.91
a tiny little apple and a cookie cookie

119.77 --> 132.25
it's like an oatmeal cookie so you might

124.91 --> 132.25
take a bite from that let's use a chat

135.24 --> 143.22
right so we got AGM in early and Amanda

140.41 --> 147.43
young stone monkey 3d more colored

143.22 --> 150.28
righteous force well who was on

147.43 --> 156.84
yesterday my way Obama cool

150.28 --> 156.84
Jason McCormack Colin or : Turner

160.02 --> 165.72
random to see ya stop a trafficking my

164.05 --> 174.22
rest a hat

165.72 --> 179.56
Tesla's Apple I thought I mentioned more

174.22 --> 184.9
colored is it because I is flat

179.56 --> 186.04
I killed the hope its McLeod pumpkin

184.9 --> 189.61
yeah

186.04 --> 200.10999999999999
Michael O'Rourke good to see you all BK

189.61 --> 201.88000000000002
k Dave yeah so yeah I thought it was

200.11 --> 205.24
still just a little bit too hard to put

201.88 --> 208.39
on a t-shirt because I could do it but

205.24 --> 211.42000000000002
then I'd be a bit overheated and I think

208.39 --> 216.27999999999997
that I'm having overheating issues in

211.42 --> 220.83999999999997
general because there's this muscle over

216.28 --> 223.2
here in a very weird place like not on

220.84 --> 225.94
the on the surface but it's pretty I

223.2 --> 231.19
think it's like one of the throat

225.94 --> 233.74
muscles that gets into my back I don't

231.19 --> 235.8
know which one it is exactly but it's

233.74 --> 238.3
killing me it's been killing me for days

235.8 --> 242.08
and it feels like there's like an

238.3 --> 245.53
inflammation there because of the heat

242.08 --> 248.77
that probably made everything swollen

245.53 --> 251.86
more than usual and these muscles just

248.77 --> 255.19
couldn't get proper blood flow during

251.86 --> 257.52000000000004
that time so they just started to gather

255.19 --> 261.1
the toxins because I still use them it's

257.52 --> 264.75
it's one of the muscles that helps me

261.1 --> 268.8
keep my head straight up

264.75 --> 275.1
one of the few and I think I've also

268.8 --> 278.40000000000003
been just stupidly being very tired late

275.1 --> 280.44
at night and just not wanting to go away

278.4 --> 283.02
from the ski screen even though you're

280.44 --> 286.05
like keeping yourself awake that's also

283.02 --> 287.72999999999996
very strenuous on those muscles so I

286.05 --> 292.77000000000004
think the combination of the heat and

287.73 --> 295.41
that probably did this and now I'm have

292.77 --> 298.44
been performing what you could say dip

295.41 --> 302.97
deep tissue massage with which is kind

298.44 --> 308.01
of painful on myself because I know if I

302.97 --> 310.53000000000003
do that it'll go away but it's very

308.01 --> 312.51
tedious to do but on the other hand

310.53 --> 315.02
otherwise I'm just gonna sit there with

312.51 --> 320.78999999999996
pain all the time it's really annoying I

315.02 --> 322.89
got some selves as well for muscle ache

320.79 --> 325.83000000000004
and all that anyway

322.89 --> 328.2
assault better God at bath how about

325.83 --> 335.3
just a bath I don't have a bath I only

328.2 --> 341.07
have a shower yeah a bath would be great

335.3 --> 344.21000000000004
with this heat in general but yeah

341.07 --> 344.21
doesn't gonna happen unfortunately

345.94 --> 352.479
yeah but this is just this is not the

350.27 --> 356.09
first time this kind of thing happened

352.479 --> 359.11
usually when I go on a vacation when I

356.09 --> 362.86999999999995
was younger as well especially after my

359.11 --> 365.84000000000003
after my teens that started happening I

362.87 --> 368.389
got like well I started to get like

365.84 --> 370.36999999999995
those weird metabolic things where

368.389 --> 374.18
subtly like and there's something that

370.37 --> 376.1
really hurts or that starts to happen

374.18 --> 379.40000000000003
with a lot of people after their teens

376.1 --> 382.72900000000004
or during their teens they get their

379.4 --> 385.13
ailments and well one of the ailments is

382.729 --> 389.03
with my muscles I have to take very

385.13 --> 393.15999999999997
careful care of them if I don't I'm

389.03 --> 396.229
gonna be like complaining old man like

393.16 --> 400.699
my mother kind of was like that so I

396.229 --> 404.11
afraid I inherited that from her but I'm

400.699 --> 404.11
much more careful with myself

410.45 --> 417.53999999999996
also have to be very careful with coffee

413.15 --> 421.14
I'm doing this now to test it with its

417.54 --> 425.22
Tamera coffee of course because coffee

421.14 --> 427.38
tends to aggravate muscle tensions so I

425.22 --> 430.44000000000005
have to be very careful with that and

427.38 --> 432.96
see if it worsens it a lot and if it

430.44 --> 435.66
will then I'll probably just cut coffee

432.96 --> 439.84999999999997
out of my diet for a while until this is

435.66 --> 442.35
back to normal again hmm

439.85 --> 449.58000000000004
which is kind of sad because I do like

442.35 --> 453.36
my coffee yoga stretching now look I

449.58 --> 457.90999999999997
don't follow any yoga disciplines but I

453.36 --> 463.11
look I do stretching like you see me

457.91 --> 471.18
lots at times I like stretching a lot

463.11 --> 473.16
it's a very pleasant feeling so but

471.18 --> 475.14
sometimes you just need a little bit

473.16 --> 479.64000000000004
extra you need to give careful attention

475.14 --> 483.22999999999996
to muscles that are difficult to even

479.64 --> 483.22999999999996
figure out that they're there

490.08 --> 502.02
foam roller well I use my fingers it has

497.61 --> 505.92
a dual function because I can literally

502.02 --> 510.75
use my magnetizing effect directly

505.92 --> 514.23
transfer pain from that location to my

510.75 --> 516.42
fingers and yeah it feels literally like

514.23 --> 518.82
somebody's standing on my fingers that's

516.42 --> 522.24
true although I don't let it get to that

518.82 --> 526.1700000000001
level of pain transfer but I'm kind of

522.24 --> 529.17
used to it I'm used to that because I've

526.17 --> 534.36
done it and trained it so much I'm used

529.17 --> 537.9599999999999
to it and it really works it's yeah

534.36 --> 541.8000000000001
normally a typical masseur will

537.96 --> 544.2900000000001
literally just Nene and displace all

541.8 --> 548.28
that stress and well the the chemicals

544.29 --> 550.29
that are presumably causing it around

548.28 --> 552.65
and move it around your body so your

550.29 --> 555.75
body will more easily absorb it back

552.65 --> 559.56
into the bloodstream and everything but

555.75 --> 565.71
the magnetizing that's something unique

559.56 --> 568.8
I don't know what how I can't really

565.71 --> 573.6600000000001
explain I can explain it through energy

568.8 --> 577.2299999999999
but I can't tie it in with how it would

573.66 --> 579.39
chemically work I have no idea what

577.23 --> 583.86
exactly happens now I don't use magnets

579.39 --> 586.92
I use my own muscle tension and a

583.86 --> 593.79
special kind of focus it's a technique I

586.92 --> 599.6999999999999
learned when I was 17 or right yeah 70

593.79 --> 602.9399999999999
18 from my first girlfriend and it's

599.7 --> 603.51
palpable other people can detect it very

602.94 --> 607.71
much so

603.51 --> 610.4399999999999
and I'm so good at it that I learned to

607.71 --> 614.37
read the types of pain so I can identify

610.44 --> 617.25
pain types even those that a man cannot

614.37 --> 621.13
even experience in person I recognize it

617.25 --> 625.48
because I have felt it

621.13 --> 627.04
and that's my skill and I'm so certain

625.48 --> 630.64
it I'd bet my life on it

627.04 --> 636.25
that certain because I've been doing it

630.64 --> 638.5
over half my life now and at first I was

636.25 --> 641.53
kind of reckless because I was like oh

638.5 --> 644.14
my god I have superpowers or something

641.53 --> 646.63
what could this turn out to be and I

644.14 --> 650.73
think like yeah I go full in and then

646.63 --> 655.75
like absorb really heavy [ __ ] like

650.73 --> 657.94
submerged PTSD trauma or something that

655.75 --> 659.89
people were suppressing and I could feel

657.94 --> 661.75
it you like it's shaking underneath and

659.89 --> 668.02
I would like say okay let it come out

661.75 --> 672.82
and now well boom it is like getting a

668.02 --> 674.62
psionic assault when you do that so I'm

672.82 --> 676.69
much more careful these days

674.62 --> 678.97
with applying it to others but the funny

676.69 --> 684.6300000000001
thing is I can apply to myself as well

678.97 --> 687.64
and yeah there's no loss of energy it's

684.63 --> 692.14
effectively as much spending of energy

687.64 --> 695.4399999999999
muscle wise as a small workout and I

692.14 --> 698.41
basically displace the effective pain

695.44 --> 701.1400000000001
and then resolve it from my hands

698.41 --> 703.4399999999999
because yeah I shake it off and that

701.14 --> 703.4399999999999
works

716.34 --> 727.4300000000001
right now but the way look why it is

723.51 --> 730.56
magnetizing how I first identified it is

727.43 --> 737.31
because you can do it without touching

730.56 --> 740.0699999999999
somebody it's you can feel that you can

737.31 --> 744.3299999999999
transfer the pain without touching

740.07 --> 748.32
somebody I basically need as much as an

744.33 --> 751.7700000000001
inch of space and that's enough to do it

748.32 --> 753.87
I could do it more or rather well then I

751.77 --> 756.3
couldn't do the magnetizing effect I

753.87 --> 759.33
couldn't draw pain out over too much of

756.3 --> 763.4399999999999
it I can draw out tension like soul

759.33 --> 765.6500000000001
tension like nervousness that I can get

763.44 --> 769.2
over ala fast distance but much muscular

765.65 --> 771.14
pain no I have to be within an inch of

769.2 --> 776.01
distance and then it can transfer you

771.14 --> 779.279
how can I show you new W you'd have to

776.01 --> 781.4399999999999
be here and then experience it you know

779.279 --> 785.1
I'll be happy to demonstrate this effect

781.44 --> 787.32
at the Flat Earth convention in

785.1 --> 789.9200000000001
Amsterdam the September's sure I'll

787.32 --> 796.4000000000001
demonstrate it yeah it's literally a

789.92 --> 799.37
skill yeah that I can do second nature

796.4 --> 802.29
but anyway to actually absorb the

799.37 --> 806.1
muscular tension I need to be within an

802.29 --> 809.52
inch but I can over faster distance up

806.1 --> 811.47
to half a meter actually project raw

809.52 --> 813.87
energy it is the other way around

811.47 --> 817.86
instead of drawing out energy

813.87 --> 821.15
I basically boost it's almost you could

817.86 --> 823.77
say well it's like an imaginary

821.15 --> 827.04
comparison to going super saiyan and

823.77 --> 832.1899999999999
just mustering a lot of energy and then

827.04 --> 835.65
projecting it and it works it works I've

832.19 --> 837.99
helped people correct very serious back

835.65 --> 839.67
problems that musters and everything

837.99 --> 843.5600000000001
couldn't get away in that they take took

839.67 --> 848.02
medication of for then I did that and

843.56 --> 856.4499999999999
after was it fifty years or something

848.02 --> 859.4499999999999
it was gone so yeah I've I've done that

856.45 --> 864.3100000000001
I've done a lot of pretty heavy healing

859.45 --> 869.2
things in my 20s in between my 20s and

864.31 --> 871.6899999999999
30s I did that all the time even just to

869.2 --> 873.94
reaffirm to myself that I can actually

871.69 --> 877.5400000000001
do it and then it works because I'm

873.94 --> 881.5290000000001
baffled that I can do it that that is

877.54 --> 884.61
something a human being can do and it

881.529 --> 884.61
happens to be me

894.86 --> 896.92
uhh

898.549 --> 906.149
I'm sorry if you don't believe it you

901.109 --> 908.969
know there's other things I can do as

906.149 --> 911.369
well but I'd have to be in the right

908.969 --> 914.099
zone I have to have it a proper feeling

911.369 --> 915.8290000000001
of trust so it's probably not gonna work

914.099 --> 918.9490000000001
all that well in public like this

915.829 --> 923.3389999999999
because if there is trolls around then

918.949 --> 929.579
it's gonna mess up my balance but I can

923.339 --> 932.849
read things over distance I can figure

929.579 --> 940.2289999999999
out people from photographs and I can

932.849 --> 943.499
even perform healing over distance it's

940.229 --> 946.0490000000001
amazing it's yeah I originally explained

943.499 --> 947.809
it through my own science fiction

946.049 --> 950.489
approach of it before all of this

947.809 --> 953.159
unfolded all this this journey of

950.489 --> 956.489
knowledge that it would be a quantum

953.159 --> 959.3389999999999
mechanical effect because of the Spirit

956.489 --> 961.5590000000001
that would be able to travel in the

959.339 --> 964.129
fourth dimension basically and instantly

961.559 --> 966.629
connect and there's a lot of New Age

964.129 --> 969.47
sciency stories that have been going

966.629 --> 975.779
around for 20 years that were kind of

969.47 --> 982.169
going after that and I well I tested it

975.779 --> 985.579
and whatever causes that it works it

982.169 --> 985.579
works a lot of the time

987.44 --> 996.1990000000001
Oh God views on the ether well that all

993.98 --> 998.72
depends on which ether you're talking

996.199 --> 1001.529
about there's the ether concerning light

998.72 --> 1004.899
within the sign within the physics field

1001.529 --> 1008.529
that either and then there's the ether

1004.899 --> 1014.35
of the the traditional spirit energy of

1008.529 --> 1017.62
the old the old ways and the alchemical

1014.35 --> 1021.16
ways you could call them that kind of

1017.62 --> 1026.65
approach to ether and then there is the

1021.16 --> 1029.74
chemical ether which happens to be yeah

1026.65 --> 1032.5590000000002
you get knocked out if you sniff that so

1029.74 --> 1040.0
what is what exactly do you want my

1032.559 --> 1044.26
views on PGA alright music man remote

1040.0 --> 1048.94
viewing is indeed a thing but what I'm

1044.26 --> 1052.12
talking about is more remote checking

1048.94 --> 1055.3300000000002
its spirit checking my Gila can do it

1052.12 --> 1059.9799999999998
like a master but I could do it before I

1055.33 --> 1063.039
even got to know him it's just you check

1059.98 --> 1067.15
out people what they're feeling like

1063.039 --> 1072.12
what their overall tension within their

1067.15 --> 1078.45
spirit is that's one of the things and

1072.12 --> 1080.559
well if you could give them energy

1078.45 --> 1083.049
although yeah if they don't know about

1080.559 --> 1086.26
it then might have unpredictable results

1083.049 --> 1089.53
but if you are with a person say on the

1086.26 --> 1092.89
phone that you're very close with that I

1089.53 --> 1096.45
have been close with like that my friend

1092.89 --> 1099.19
that I visited less this Saturday I

1096.45 --> 1103.15
could do that over the phone with her

1099.19 --> 1106.799
and she can do it with me as well it's

1103.15 --> 1106.799
really fascinating how that works

1112.22 --> 1119.63
okay music man want to do a test are we

1116.63 --> 1119.63
right

1126.12 --> 1136.4799999999998
placebo effect is universal maybe but if

1133.45 --> 1139.63
it could be it could be the placebo

1136.48 --> 1141.67
effect but why would it then affect

1139.63 --> 1145.42
somebody even if they weren't aware of

1141.67 --> 1149.2
it because the placebos rests purely on

1145.42 --> 1151.8600000000001
the conscious awareness and belief of

1149.2 --> 1151.8600000000001
the person

1166.609 --> 1177.119
now there is a a spirit contact in a way

1172.59 --> 1182.129
it exists it is I conceptualize it that

1177.119 --> 1185.309
it is our imaginary personal world where

1182.129 --> 1187.9499999999998
we conceptualize things that realm and

1185.309 --> 1193.2
where we dream things that is like a

1187.95 --> 1194.999
personal stage for everyone and as you

1193.2 --> 1196.5900000000001
grow yeah you learn to do a lot of

1194.999 --> 1199.019
things with them depending on what

1196.59 --> 1201.4499999999998
you're being confronted with and yeah

1199.019 --> 1203.759
you could use it as a switchboard you

1201.45 --> 1206.039
could use it as an oversight tool to

1203.759 --> 1209.039
have to keep track of massive amount of

1206.039 --> 1211.609
individuals for example or you could use

1209.039 --> 1214.47
it as a design platform

1211.609 --> 1216.09
there's so many ways you could use the

1214.47 --> 1218.659
imagination technically but I'm

1216.09 --> 1224.129
approaching it more concrete because the

1218.659 --> 1228.659
imagination has been so wide it's it's

1224.129 --> 1232.1899999999998
nonspecific if you say imagination but

1228.659 --> 1239.6290000000001
that tool there is something about it

1232.19 --> 1239.6290000000001
with emotions and personal focus and

1240.139 --> 1246.619
sometimes you can you connect with

1242.999 --> 1251.239
somebody and then if you have similar

1246.619 --> 1253.619
views these similar ways you are

1251.239 --> 1256.859
constructing things in your mind if that

1253.619 --> 1259.4399999999998
matches in many many functions or in

1256.859 --> 1260.519
many approaches then there is a happened

1259.44 --> 1263.45
something unique

1260.519 --> 1266.33
it is like there's a telephone

1263.45 --> 1269.489
telepathic connection like it is

1266.33 --> 1273.029
recognized by spirits by the spirits

1269.489 --> 1277.529
both that these regions are synchronized

1273.029 --> 1281.519
and other things start to happen with

1277.529 --> 1286.019
the contact that's one thing and then

1281.519 --> 1287.759
there is just there seems to be that you

1286.019 --> 1291.779
can literally connect through the

1287.759 --> 1296.129
imagination and through dreams and that

1291.779 --> 1298.32
I have had that reaffirmed by pretty

1296.129 --> 1300.09
amazing experiences that I had where

1298.32 --> 1306.299
I had shared dreams with people that

1300.09 --> 1310.98
remembered it so there is something

1306.299 --> 1313.74
within that personal realm there it's

1310.98 --> 1316.1390000000001
more than just fantasy just your

1313.74 --> 1318.1490000000001
personal fantasy bubble no it can

1316.139 --> 1324.9189999999999
there's an ethereal there is an ethereal

1318.149 --> 1328.1689999999999
or a spiritual or network connection

1324.919 --> 1334.6200000000001
with those you are synchronized with

1328.169 --> 1338.179
with those that have your frequency see

1334.62 --> 1338.1789999999999
how it all connects

1351.04 --> 1359.2
I think it is probably due to the

1353.35 --> 1363.33
natural state of information and

1359.2 --> 1366.4
intelligence itself and that as we

1363.33 --> 1368.53
attain the higher levels with the new

1366.4 --> 1371.3200000000002
oversight and the new functions that

1368.53 --> 1374.85
come with them we are equally then

1371.32 --> 1378.6699999999998
burdened and challenged by our own

1374.85 --> 1380.9199999999998
personal Devils and desires that want to

1378.67 --> 1384.22
keep things simple or that do not want

1380.92 --> 1386.74
to let certain dreams break and that

1384.22 --> 1389.23
then keeps you from attaining that

1386.74 --> 1392.89
higher consciousness because it is too

1389.23 --> 1398.01
burdensome because that is the more you

1392.89 --> 1401.92
see the more it'll weigh on you and it

1398.01 --> 1407.11
people always underestimate it if they

1401.92 --> 1418.21
haven't gone there ignorance is bliss it

1407.11 --> 1422.11
is a very specific truth all right ok I

1418.21 --> 1425.04
see Nathan is going live again a half an

1422.11 --> 1425.04
hour good to see

1431.57 --> 1439.34
well I GM I can be a psychiatrist if if

1435.889 --> 1441.35
I needed to be I am I am whatever I am a

1439.34 --> 1447.369
therapist I am a psychiatrist I am a

1441.35 --> 1451.759
masseur I am a shaman I am a Christian

1447.369 --> 1454.4599999999998
priest that basically for myself and for

1451.759 --> 1457.129
others that take my example in my own

1454.46 --> 1460.82
way the the eclectic path of Christ

1457.129 --> 1464.4989999999998
follower I am many things and whenever

1460.82 --> 1467.6899999999998
it is required of me and I am willing to

1464.499 --> 1471.249
do that with the people to engage with

1467.69 --> 1471.249
them then I will

1489.69 --> 1495.18
okay Wow

1497.279 --> 1500.7
thank you for that

1508.11 --> 1511.79
yes yes I am

1528.49 --> 1533.95
right white bear but that's why look I'm

1531.79 --> 1537.61
not gonna be a paid psychiatrist

1533.95 --> 1542.8600000000001
nobody's gonna pay me for anything but I

1537.61 --> 1548.08
can do it I can do it very well and I

1542.86 --> 1550.78
could probably just fake being one of

1548.08 --> 1552.6699999999998
those functions and then just do it and

1550.78 --> 1556.96
people wouldn't even know the difference

1552.67 --> 1562.99
even colleagues maybe things get it too

1556.96 --> 1566.3500000000001
specific but yeah the the whole paper

1562.99 --> 1568.59
issue and and what they demand your

1566.35 --> 1574.4399999999998
approach be and the code of conduct

1568.59 --> 1578.4599999999998
that's the part where I yeah that's

1574.44 --> 1578.46
where it's not gonna work out

1583.31 --> 1588.52
but I have the skill and I've applied it

1585.62 --> 1593.4499999999998
many times I applied whenever I can and

1588.52 --> 1598.52
a lot of people need it they are in need

1593.45 --> 1600.28
of it and seriously for there's maybe

1598.52 --> 1603.26
many friends that have visited

1600.28 --> 1605.02
psychiatrist and they complain to me

1603.26 --> 1608.93
about it

1605.02 --> 1611.11
because the psychiatrist just want to

1608.93 --> 1615.1100000000001
feed a few mo a lot of them they just

1611.11 --> 1618.4399999999998
want you to relax with them so you want

1615.11 --> 1621.4699999999998
to go back to them to relax and just

1618.44 --> 1623.72
keep on rambling and they might be

1621.47 --> 1627.89
helpful in certain constructive

1623.72 --> 1632.96
suggestions but truly fixing it right

1627.89 --> 1635.45
away like being parental about it

1632.96 --> 1637.97
because that is usually what people need

1635.45 --> 1639.19
and what they've lacked to get in that

1637.97 --> 1643.01
position

1639.19 --> 1647.99
psychiatrists rarely do that and I do do

1643.01 --> 1650.93
that I take what is necessary and I do

1647.99 --> 1654.68
it and I offer it to those individuals

1650.93 --> 1657.17
and some of them actually can't couldn't

1654.68 --> 1661.01
handle it and then literally deflect it

1657.17 --> 1663.17
and walked away after that because they

1661.01 --> 1667.87
were confronted that they really had an

1663.17 --> 1667.8700000000001
issue and they couldn't face it

1668.56 --> 1674.3899999999999
so that also happened but there's been

1671.48 --> 1676.91
many I think the majority of people that

1674.39 --> 1679.93
I had such that I tried something like

1676.91 --> 1683.45
that with that really did embrace it and

1679.93 --> 1689.3500000000001
got out of it better and more

1683.45 --> 1692.3500000000001
self-sufficient more disciplined and

1689.35 --> 1692.35
self-reliant

1694.33 --> 1697.53
[Music]

1697.63 --> 1704.65
it is in my experience necessity and the

1704.83 --> 1715.4299999999998
realization of necessity that spawns

1708.13 --> 1718.5500000000002
skill and confidence so it is a trick to

1715.43 --> 1722.0
make somebody realize that so they have

1718.55 --> 1725.6599999999999
an alternative state and folk state of

1722.0 --> 1729.47
mind and focus to grab on to to escape

1725.66 --> 1733.5500000000002
the old paradigm that they're trapped in

1729.47 --> 1737.74
and it needs to be very appealing very

1733.55 --> 1737.74
very alluring or they will not take it

1753.0 --> 1762.36
okay thanks music man I'm not sure about

1755.74 --> 1762.36
the PJs though but thanks for that

1770.0 --> 1786.26
by the way how is my sound see I at

1776.78 --> 1788.51
still normal good hmm Oh Steve really

1786.26 --> 1791.45
haven't seen Jose while Jose was life

1788.51 --> 1797.51
this morning he's been going live in the

1791.45 --> 1800.96
well in at night for the us or at a very

1797.51 --> 1803.45
very early mornings and he's been doing

1800.96 --> 1807.41
shows there there was another Spurs Kimo

1803.45 --> 1811.3400000000001
show today with Spurs Kimo doing what he

1807.41 --> 1814.16
does again yeah he's it I love it

1811.34 --> 1817.03
actually because I get up a lot earlier

1814.16 --> 1819.68
and then when I get on my computer then

1817.03 --> 1822.3999999999999
sometimes it turns out that Jose is life

1819.68 --> 1827.0900000000001
and I'm actually enjoying those

1822.4 --> 1828.71
discussions a lot I could say that I

1827.09 --> 1832.49
like them better in the morning then

1828.71 --> 1836.96
when he does it after the debate time in

1832.49 --> 1839.56
the evening for me so this morning was

1836.96 --> 1839.56
quite amusing

1846.169 --> 1852.6200000000001
alright by the way Colin Turner

1848.49 --> 1852.6200000000001
I hope you received my email reply

1859.399 --> 1868.83
but anyways so yeah I watched Darren's

1863.94 --> 1876.48
video of last night really good I loved

1868.83 --> 1879.299
it I had watched almost the entire way

1876.48 --> 1882.1200000000001
through but then the show yeah I had to

1879.299 --> 1888.75
start to show I loved it it was really

1882.12 --> 1891.7199999999998
good also sad to see that lift of hill

1888.75 --> 1894.96
is basically no longer going live now on

1891.72 --> 1898.76
youtube he is going live on his other

1894.96 --> 1903.3890000000001
platforms records it and then premieres

1898.76 --> 1907.049
his videos but yeah no more life

1903.389 --> 1909.899
interaction kind of sad but I think that

1907.049 --> 1916.5
he just had to bail because YouTube was

1909.899 --> 1925.9699999999998
just trying to strangle him strangle his

1916.5 --> 1929.33
channel so whoa really wow thanks man

1925.97 --> 1935.309
thank you so much you're a lifesaver

1929.33 --> 1938.99
whoo that's really awesome

1935.309 --> 1938.99
that's great relief

1944.48 --> 1947.749
[Music]

1951.39 --> 1957.2900000000002
Wow

1954.29 --> 1958.34
that's interesting my shoulder actually

1957.29 --> 1961.01
feels really good

1958.34 --> 1967.07
despite drinking the coffee maybe it

1961.01 --> 1972.44
wasn't tumeric huh yeah no it feels

1967.07 --> 1977.21
great hopefully I'll be rid of it in a

1972.44 --> 1983.0900000000001
day or so that I can move on to more

1977.21 --> 1984.95
interesting subjects all right tamarick

1983.09 --> 1995.0
is good that way also by the way it

1984.95 --> 1998.47
might have something to do with with

1995.0 --> 1998.47
this stuff what is it called

2003.61 --> 2016.6899999999998
yeah what is it yeah arnica it's arnica

2010.52 --> 2020.12
gel arnica is great for muscle pain and

2016.69 --> 2022.6000000000001
yeah specifically for this type of issue

2020.12 --> 2025.58
arnica is just great

2022.6 --> 2027.98
this isn't the best type of version that

2025.58 --> 2032.1499999999999
I've come across but it it kind of works

2027.98 --> 2039.43
so probably have to look more careful

2032.15 --> 2041.96
for more organic versions now arnica I

2039.43 --> 2054.82
don't know if the name is the same in

2041.96 --> 2062.6
English let me check it out now it is

2054.82 --> 2069.26
it's the same it's a plant of the

2062.6 --> 2077.0299999999997
sunflower family the Esther s SIA Esther

2069.26 --> 2078.98
Esther Isaiah family apparently but yeah

2077.03 --> 2082.8990000000003
it works great it's one of those plants

2078.98 --> 2082.899
another one of God's miracles

2089.23 --> 2096.2400000000002
hmm pot does the job well it can

2096.3 --> 2101.92
although I do smoke it with tobacco and

2099.04 --> 2110.2
tobacco isn't exactly the best for

2101.92 --> 2112.63
muscle aches situations but yeah well if

2110.2 --> 2116.5
you'd smoke it pure or through water

2112.63 --> 2120.13
pipe or anything yeah that definitely if

2116.5 --> 2123.19
you get a good dosage you just totally

2120.13 --> 2126.1600000000003
mellow out and then it'll definitely get

2123.19 --> 2130.4500000000003
a good chance to relax and hey good

2126.16 --> 2134.89
sleeping well also helps so I've slept

2130.45 --> 2140.9199999999996
really well this night pretty long I

2134.89 --> 2145.24
went to bed 11 o'clock so that's for me

2140.92 --> 2150.94
incredibly early and I got up wow I

2145.24 --> 2157.3289999999997
think 9 o'clock so I slept long and I

2150.94 --> 2161.099
needed it I probably need more and but

2157.329 --> 2161.099
it was a good start catching up

2174.02 --> 2181.4
I could you be more specific white bear

2177.74 --> 2183.74
how come all God's miracles are so great

2181.4 --> 2187.09
and yet all the stuff that will kill you

2183.74 --> 2193.66
is overlooked as God's creation also

2187.09 --> 2198.17
right well isn't that always the case

2193.66 --> 2200.5099999999998
it's up to the individual yeah you can

2198.17 --> 2206.32
get all sneaky and evil and poisonous

2200.51 --> 2215.44
and [ __ ] or you can just heal things

2206.32 --> 2218.4500000000003
very quickly and even help individuals

2215.44 --> 2231.53
attain certain abilities or skills

2218.45 --> 2233.6299999999997
better so it's up to the individual but

2231.53 --> 2235.67
yeah it's true God's creations are

2233.63 --> 2238.01
pretty incredible but there's also some

2235.67 --> 2239.66
weird freaky stuff out there but that's

2238.01 --> 2242.48
that's just how it works

2239.66 --> 2245.39
and look even with the freaky stuff

2242.48 --> 2247.67
sometimes things work out pretty weirdly

2245.39 --> 2251.089
as something that would have been

2247.67 --> 2254.06
considered a poison may later have been

2251.089 --> 2258.95
figured out could be applied as some

2254.06 --> 2263.57
kind of cure it that happens but even

2258.95 --> 2266.0
with snake poison it's exactly yeah but

2263.57 --> 2270.56
the thing about snake oil that's the

2266.0 --> 2273.859
ironic thing about it is it works it

2270.56 --> 2276.56
really does it's so hilarious that they

2273.859 --> 2280.66
call it snake oil salesman and that's

2276.56 --> 2284.93
supposed to be a fake because it works

2280.66 --> 2287.6299999999997
it's just the ones that sell you goat

2284.93 --> 2291.14
droppings as some kind of miracle cure

2287.63 --> 2296.53
those are the ones that are the fakers

2291.14 --> 2296.5299999999997
but snake oil actually works so

2297.93 --> 2300.68
Yeah right

2304.87 --> 2311.44
maybe not for humans necessarily exactly

2307.42 --> 2316.03
look the palette of existence is very

2311.44 --> 2319.62
complex and designed for all time and

2316.03 --> 2325.7200000000003
all development so everything has

2319.62 --> 2327.67
multi-layer purposes every aspect at one

2325.72 --> 2330.73
period something would be seen as a

2327.67 --> 2336.16
toxin and then in another period it

2330.73 --> 2339.97
would suddenly be the catalyzer for for

2336.16 --> 2345.04
a revolution of some kind and then later

2339.97 --> 2350.62
that same stuff maybe may become a huge

2345.04 --> 2354.07
problem again and then people will

2350.62 --> 2357.88
strive to no longer use it and get rid

2354.07 --> 2360.4
of it so yeah but you could fill that in

2357.88 --> 2366.09
with a lot of things and it kind of

2360.4 --> 2369.9700000000003
works like that throughout history so

2366.09 --> 2372.8500000000004
look there are things like a very very

2369.97 --> 2375.97
hostile Nate nature for example very

2372.85 --> 2379.48
poisonous creatures especially flying

2375.97 --> 2381.22
insects or like for example the

2379.48 --> 2386.7400000000002
caterpillars that have very poisonous

2381.22 --> 2389.62
hairs yeah that kind of stuff okay don't

2386.74 --> 2391.87
exterminate it but definitely just keep

2389.62 --> 2393.46
it as far away out of the way as

2391.87 --> 2396.13
possible it's not one of those things

2393.46 --> 2402.25
you want to allow to spread everywhere

2396.13 --> 2405.55
in nature but yeah who knows at one

2402.25 --> 2410.22
point some of those insects may be the

2405.55 --> 2410.2200000000003
key ingredient to some kind of new

2412.26 --> 2417.4900000000002
industrial application or technology

2415.09 --> 2421.3
that may be very good you don't know you

2417.49 --> 2422.95
could be not good but it could also be

2421.3 --> 2424.71
good you never really know it all

2422.95 --> 2427.83
depends on the individuals that are

2424.71 --> 2427.83
using it

2436.3 --> 2447.65
after when it

2438.01 --> 2450.05
that's terrible thing to say do you

2447.65 --> 2453.59
agree we should increase taxes at least

2450.05 --> 2454.51
until the wall is built well that's the

2453.59 --> 2457.19
whole thing

2454.51 --> 2460.84
the from whatever what I've understood

2457.19 --> 2468.08
is that Congress is simply blocking any

2460.84 --> 2471.02
budget attempts to fund the wall so the

2468.08 --> 2473.48
problem is it Congress and they're not

2471.02 --> 2477.53
gonna change their minds they are

2473.48 --> 2481.22
politically obsessed against having that

2477.53 --> 2484.9700000000003
wall built so what are you gonna do it's

2481.22 --> 2488.4199999999996
not look if people raked in a billion

2484.97 --> 2491.72
dollars voluntarily that freakin wall

2488.42 --> 2493.75
still not gonna get built okay not by

2491.72 --> 2496.4599999999996
the Congress not by the government

2493.75 --> 2498.2
absolutely not they're just not gonna do

2496.46 --> 2501.95
it no matter how much money you throw at

2498.2 --> 2514.04
it so the only way to do it is if it's

2501.95 --> 2516.0499999999997
done privately just you know it's like

2514.04 --> 2518.27
the public state not the deep state but

2516.05 --> 2520.1600000000003
the public state the public if the

2518.27 --> 2524.69
government doesn't do it then organize

2520.16 --> 2526.73
and just do it with something like this

2524.69 --> 2529.13
and not like you hunting parties or

2526.73 --> 2533.87
whatever but in the case of a wall I

2529.13 --> 2536.27
think just getting together get wide

2533.87 --> 2539.42
petitions get public get construction

2536.27 --> 2541.79
workers and make a giant public project

2539.42 --> 2542.77
out of it and just build it screw the

2541.79 --> 2546.29
government

2542.77 --> 2549.29
screw Congress just build a freakin

2546.29 --> 2551.42
thing and then yeah hopefully there will

2549.29 --> 2553.82
be some security guys and maybe ice will

2551.42 --> 2555.89
help they probably will help of course

2553.82 --> 2559.7200000000003
they will because there's probably gonna

2555.89 --> 2563.12
get antifa mobs in that [ __ ] and then

2559.72 --> 2564.7099999999996
the weaponized migrants cuz I'm not

2563.12 --> 2567.42
saying that all of them are military

2564.71 --> 2569.73
figures but they're definitely in the

2567.42 --> 2574.41
and then they'll Dave will get harassed

2569.73 --> 2576.39
by that so but it's the only way it's

2574.41 --> 2579.0
gonna happen because government is not

2576.39 --> 2582.21
gonna build the wall no matter how much

2579.0 --> 2585.39
Trump wants it or no matter how much he

2582.21 --> 2587.85
says he wants it they're not gonna do it

2585.39 --> 2590.49
because Congress is just blocking it and

2587.85 --> 2594.27
there is nothing that can be done to

2590.49 --> 2599.79
haste in the process they're just

2594.27 --> 2602.52
blocking it so that is my suggestion for

2599.79 --> 2608.22
the wall if you want to do it right do

2602.52 --> 2609.48
it yourself that's my advice for

2608.22 --> 2616.08
Americans

2609.48 --> 2619.41
concerning the wall hey who's that

2616.08 --> 2631.56
alright he's calling me okay I'll take

2619.41 --> 2634.47
him hello hello hey yeah doing great

2631.56 --> 2639.99
last ten minutes of the show all don't

2634.47 --> 2652.83
let me oh yeah yeah there's no problem

2639.99 --> 2658.74
right or you wanted to so yeah it is yes

2652.83 --> 2661.94
I did what yeah is what balloons the

2658.74 --> 2665.99
balloons all the frosty balloons right

2661.94 --> 2671.94
yeah yeah well that's funny it's simply

2665.99 --> 2674.49
transiting the gas back into a liquid by

2671.94 --> 2677.37
freezing it and yes small is making it

2674.49 --> 2679.7299999999996
smaller that is what happens it doesn't

2677.37 --> 2679.73
prove anything

2680.24 --> 2688.1699999999996
well it diminishes in pressure compared

2685.65 --> 2697.11
to everything outside so it's gonna get

2688.17 --> 2700.14
squished yeah the temperature is kind of

2697.11 --> 2703.5
forcing the molecules to contract

2700.14 --> 2708.0299999999997
and because it's closed off because it's

2703.5 --> 2709.62
closed off it's really gonna sit through

2708.03 --> 2717.3300000000004
that if there was any kind of opening

2709.62 --> 2719.19
that wouldn't happen so gravity

2717.33 --> 2721.7599999999998
what does gravity have to do with

2719.19 --> 2721.76
anything here

2725.63 --> 2732.1800000000003
really yeah I thought air pressure was

2729.45 --> 2735.45
there due to the container I thought the

2732.18 --> 2742.71
only real argument for a gravity well

2735.45 --> 2746.81
you can the gravity is causing because

2742.71 --> 2746.81
essentially it's calling the heavier

2746.99 --> 2754.1699999999996
particles to the floor so gravity is

2751.08 --> 2756.15
pulling it down creating a density

2754.17 --> 2758.25
gradient and it all comes down strategy

2756.15 --> 2762.75
for what was demonstrated yesterday the

2758.25 --> 2764.73
balloon was a there was no changing

2762.75 --> 2766.56
gravitated they were the same man who

2764.73 --> 2770.78
kept at the same height the only

2766.56 --> 2770.7799999999997
independent variable was the temperature

2770.99 --> 2780.3799999999997
or the density sorry or the density what

2777.54 --> 2785.93
causes Dennis to change the temperature

2780.38 --> 2785.9300000000003
right but the density is what made it

2786.08 --> 2790.16
the cause the cause

2790.43 --> 2804.12
all right so with the we know with the

2795.24 --> 2807.4199999999996
temperature change at least hmm so you

2804.12 --> 2810.54
know obviously instantly or as close to

2807.42 --> 2815.01
instantly change the temperature inside

2810.54 --> 2818.13
a balloon right and then you started to

2815.01 --> 2820.5
shrink regear reducing the pressure

2818.13 --> 2822.92
inside a balloon and then will be

2820.5 --> 2822.92
removed

2823.16 --> 2831.1499999999996
normal related so there was no change or

2829.8 --> 2834.13
the

2831.15 --> 2838.9
but the temperatures caused a crash in

2834.13 --> 2841.119
revenue yeah but it does there is a

2838.9 --> 2853.0
correlation between between temperature

2841.119 --> 2855.67
and pressure it's ridiculous this

2853.0 --> 2860.73
gravity simply just presumed to do all

2855.67 --> 2863.92
these things it's not relevant all right

2860.73 --> 2867.25
gravity is simply presumed to be the

2863.92 --> 2870.309
cause of all the things it's not it's

2867.25 --> 2877.319
completely superfluous in the entire

2870.309 --> 2879.9900000000002
setup creates the pressure gradient

2877.319 --> 2884.829
mm-hmm

2879.99 --> 2887.019
what we live it in a container it's

2884.829 --> 2890.26
warmer down here and the higher you go

2887.019 --> 2899.7299999999996
you go into the cooler and cooler all

2890.26 --> 2899.73
right so the colder means less pressure

2899.91 --> 2903.509
that depends

2904.539 --> 2915.4
yeah but did the one only follows the

2908.319 --> 2919.75
other and vice versa well just because

2915.4 --> 2923.89
for example very cold air would be less

2919.75 --> 2927.7
dense and sitting closer to it yeah

2923.89 --> 2930.42
being more compact doesn't mean anything

2927.7 --> 2939.16
if everything is pretty tied up

2930.42 --> 2941.17
compacted up there what do you mean but

2939.16 --> 2948.279
if you just approach it as a container

2941.17 --> 2961.17
then it's just gonna shrink if you

2948.279 --> 2961.17
essentially yeah when we do don't

2961.34 --> 2968.4300000000003
right so if that's the case then climate

2965.85 --> 2971.22
data sits in buoyancy when we talk about

2968.43 --> 2973.7999999999997
that in buoyancy we talk about just as

2971.22 --> 2977.6699999999996
things get a heavier fall down things

2973.8 --> 2981.2000000000003
that alive to the wall well in relation

2977.67 --> 2989.359
to its medium God really not calling you

2981.2 --> 2998.64
obviously it's down here on average yes

2989.359 --> 3009.38
so that's why we are you telling me

2998.64 --> 3010.7799999999997
because I was telling you you know

3009.38 --> 3014.23
buying into it

3010.78 --> 3016.94
checking these are different ways of

3014.23 --> 3020.17
validating that claim I think that a

3016.94 --> 3023.09
balloon on a balloon demonstration is

3020.17 --> 3025.4900000000002
pretty conclusive really essentially

3023.09 --> 3029.27
creating that vacuum almost inside the

3025.49 --> 3030.74
actual balloon itself when ensuring to

3029.27 --> 3034.82
shuttle to nothing

3030.74 --> 3040.7599999999998
he visited invited to be the normal

3034.82 --> 3046.52
warmer it reflected itself naturally he

3040.76 --> 3050.5400000000004
relays oh right yeah

3046.52 --> 3051.59
so he had to crush differentials one

3050.54 --> 3053.5099999999998
called long ha

3051.59 --> 3055.88
what was the mass it expands one was

3053.51 --> 3060.55
very tiring small one had a very little

3055.88 --> 3067.4
pressure wanna have a normal area here

3060.55 --> 3070.55
was the was the temperature right

3067.4 --> 3072.98
so that would also mean technically that

3070.55 --> 3075.77
eventually if balloons go up very high

3072.98 --> 3079.43
they and they don't burst they keep on

3075.77 --> 3090.2
going then at some point they may shrink

3079.43 --> 3094.85
again due to the temperature so it goes

3090.2 --> 3097.9399999999996
from warm air a thousand feet run about

3094.85 --> 3101.0899999999997
at minus 15 manage to 55 but then women

3097.94 --> 3103.4
go to matter to 20,000 feet suddenly

3101.09 --> 3105.9500000000003
warms up the game a little to manage 30

3103.4 --> 3109.2200000000003
or so so this is an actual increased

3105.95 --> 3114.73
heat of a ball of that layer so it goes

3109.22 --> 3117.3199999999997
from it will go through warm to cold

3114.73 --> 3120.26
really cold freezing you want to say and

3117.32 --> 3123.2000000000003
then of course that was about to really

3120.26 --> 3125.3590000000004
cold again the problem is that once you

3123.2 --> 3128.0
go through that next section into say

3125.359 --> 3130.31
minus 30 the balloon is diamond going

3128.0 --> 3131.78
into X found it's going to grow bigger

3130.31 --> 3134.24
because it's come out of the managed

3131.78 --> 3136.8500000000004
fifties with warming or but because it

3134.24 --> 3138.2299999999996
is in a little less pressurized there we

3136.85 --> 3141.29
go there's a blast pressure on the

3138.23 --> 3144.23
outside holding the balloon from

3141.29 --> 3146.93
expanding rapidly which is why it always

3144.23 --> 3150.17
seems to fail the balloons always seem

3146.93 --> 3152.8999999999996
to fail 122 longer than 23,000 feet

3150.17 --> 3157.52
that's the kind of the Goldilocks area

3152.9 --> 3160.79
where the feelings no work so they start

3157.52 --> 3164.06
to expand too rapidly and they burst

3160.79 --> 3167.54
yes that hmm so couldn't that be

3164.06 --> 3171.5299999999997
prevented but he's going over from when

3167.54 --> 3174.77
he's going on a firm why be the

3171.53 --> 3176.5890000000004
temperature is minus 30 right so it's

3174.77 --> 3182.059
minus s that a crash

3176.589 --> 3185.15
it's the NSP pressure is six point eight

3182.059 --> 3188.48
and then when he encounters master's

3185.15 --> 3191.7490000000003
degree which is above about 120,000 feet

3188.48 --> 3196.16
the EMT pressure is naught point one

3191.749 --> 3198.4399999999996
five on the outside so when it was able

3196.16 --> 3199.91
to travel through 18,000 think that

3198.44 --> 3202.099
minus 30 degrees

3199.91 --> 3204.049
it had a substantial amount of pressure

3202.099 --> 3206.809
on the outside is still containing it

3204.049 --> 3207.349
but once it next encountered a man is

3206.809 --> 3209.509
thirty

3207.349 --> 3211.67
after going through man and fifty eight

3209.509 --> 3213.349
expanding but then the pressure on the

3211.67 --> 3216.17
outside is on the normal point one five

3213.349 --> 3222.46
so it's got nothing to hold it to keep

3216.17 --> 3225.559
it from expanding rapidly in poverty hmm

3222.46 --> 3228.14
unless yeah unless that was somehow

3225.559 --> 3230.2690000000002
accounted for with a certain level of

3228.14 --> 3233.8689999999997
elasticity specifically for that but

3230.269 --> 3236.1189999999997
yeah how are you gonna it should be a

3233.869 --> 3245.48
thing that could be overcome with proper

3236.119 --> 3248.509
design well it could be awesome first

3245.48 --> 3252.289
chemo Tony yesterday we were talking

3248.509 --> 3253.789
about this for about six hours and you

3252.289 --> 3256.369
know we were going through all you know

3253.789 --> 3258.829
going through all of the the data the

3256.369 --> 3260.96
balloons going on everything that it

3258.829 --> 3263.1800000000003
could go putting it onto a little carafe

3260.96 --> 3264.829
figuring it all out and the only

3263.18 --> 3267.049
correlation like I said that we've got

3264.829 --> 3269.3590000000004
is the one six goals done hundred and

3267.049 --> 3271.549
twenty one thousand feet or so the

3269.359 --> 3275.269
temperature the pressure on the outside

3271.549 --> 3277.309
is so low against an average a rapidly

3275.269 --> 3280.16
expanding balloon because it's going

3277.309 --> 3284.299
into slightly warmer air that causes it

3280.16 --> 3288.049
to fail and that's just on them that

3284.299 --> 3294.2889999999998
would only be down to temperature alone

3288.049 --> 3297.349
hold on I think I found a solution you

3294.289 --> 3302.119
know what you could do have a very

3297.349 --> 3306.17
specifically designed emergency vent for

3302.119 --> 3309.109
when it reaches that point to prevent it

3306.17 --> 3310.85
from suddenly blowing up by releasing a

3309.109 --> 3313.25
little of the pressure

3310.85 --> 3316.27
so that it doesn't reach that critical

3313.25 --> 3320.12
blow-up point and then it could maintain

3316.27 --> 3323.68
that altitude maybe even grow go higher

3320.12 --> 3323.68
with an emergency

3324.1 --> 3333.43
never thought we would have to be that

3327.17 --> 3340.34
good where the temperatures could also

3333.43 --> 3343.43
really well vents usually real good

3340.34 --> 3345.44
vents deal with super high pressure and

3343.43 --> 3347.8999999999996
pressure differentials and freezing

3345.44 --> 3350.27
situations that usually happens with

3347.9 --> 3353.69
sudden pressure release so that it'll

3350.27 --> 3373.64
probably be the design for that by

3353.69 --> 3376.58
default with investigating when we look

3373.64 --> 3379.79
into it there is a way of demonstrating

3376.58 --> 3382.4
his point especially like with the

3379.79 --> 3386.06
balloons and stuff but it it makes sense

3382.4 --> 3388.79
it just make sense if you can exclude

3386.06 --> 3391.69
gravity completely and it fits perfectly

3388.79 --> 3395.3
with the density and buoyancy argument

3391.69 --> 3397.58
density buoyancy and temperature

3395.3 --> 3398.57
controls of pressure and all Spurs chemo

3397.58 --> 3401.33
says there's no pressure

3398.57 --> 3404.9500000000003
mm-hmm I think we have to agree that

3401.33 --> 3408.2599999999998
there is pressure you miss pressure or

3404.95 --> 3413.08
in temperature has an in flaws by the

3408.26 --> 3416.48
temperature and not gravity and buoyancy

3413.08 --> 3419.14
no pressure is not caused by temperature

3416.48 --> 3422.39
but it is absolutely influenced by it

3419.14 --> 3424.3399999999997
temperature has an important role in how

3422.39 --> 3427.0699999999997
pressure does seem to work within our

3424.34 --> 3431.27
realm absolutely that is not the cause

3427.07 --> 3434.15
not the sole cause I think is I think

3431.27 --> 3436.7
it's the primary cause I'll be honest I

3434.15 --> 3438.4700000000003
mean from what I've been looking at the

3436.7 --> 3441.91
last couple of weeks I definitely think

3438.47 --> 3443.77
it's the primary cause I could be wrong

3441.91 --> 3445.2999999999997
you know and a lot of people are

3443.77 --> 3446.77
probably laughing in your chat right now

3445.3 --> 3449.17
don't know cuz I've actually got your

3446.77 --> 3451.15
chat open so I can't actually see but

3449.17 --> 3453.31
one thing's for sure it's something

3451.15 --> 3456.94
that's not gonna go away very quickly

3453.31 --> 3459.63
this argument and I think that once

3456.94 --> 3461.35
people understand that it isn't actually

3459.63 --> 3464.8900000000003
against Flat Earth

3461.35 --> 3468.22
it actually cements the argument for

3464.89 --> 3471.7599999999998
having a density and buoyancy pressure

3468.22 --> 3473.7999999999997
gradient that is entirely influenced

3471.76 --> 3477.01
just on temperature oh absolutely I

3473.8 --> 3480.3100000000004
agree on that of course as I said

3477.01 --> 3482.7400000000002
temperature has an important role to

3480.31 --> 3486.7
play in how pressure seems to function

3482.74 --> 3488.56
within this realm absolutely another

3486.7 --> 3492.85
reason I rang it was because I saw you

3488.56 --> 3495.52
on Jose's this morning in the chat you

3492.85 --> 3498.79
were giving chemo a bit of grief I just

3495.52 --> 3502.06
thought you know I mean there's no need

3498.79 --> 3504.43
oh yeah there is I'm I'm not attacking

3502.06 --> 3508.81
in him on his argument I'm attacking him

3504.43 --> 3516.24
on the way he brings it and what he does

3508.81 --> 3518.86
I'm attacking that oh yeah oh yeah yeah

3516.24 --> 3522.6
that's nothing gonna be stopping me at

3518.86 --> 3527.77
that because he is applying weird

3522.6 --> 3530.4
techniques it's just and doesn't know

3527.77 --> 3534.58
[ __ ] he struggles but why doesn't fix it

3530.4 --> 3536.9500000000003
before he starts to see how I've

3534.58 --> 3539.5
explained it to you right now in this 15

3536.95 --> 3541.3599999999997
minutes chapter we've had essentially if

3539.5 --> 3543.34
he says if he explained it just like

3541.36 --> 3545.9500000000003
that I think people would just get it

3543.34 --> 3549.31
yeah because it would make sense but the

3545.95 --> 3551.6499999999996
brother yeah no [ __ ] that's the problem

3549.31 --> 3553.83
and he literally denies gas pressure and

3551.65 --> 3557.8
all that [ __ ] and he starts to just

3553.83 --> 3561.19
observe or sketch out scenarios and then

3557.8 --> 3564.5800000000004
try to cut the gas pressure out of it it

3561.19 --> 3567.66
doesn't make any sense is he's breaking

3564.58 --> 3570.61
up everything the correlations it's just

3567.66 --> 3575.5099999999998
look you have a point because you

3570.61 --> 3578.63
actually had a complete set up that

3575.51 --> 3581.3300000000004
recognize what gas pressure is that it

3578.63 --> 3583.34
is there okay so that made sense

3581.33 --> 3586.4
what's worse chemo does does not make

3583.34 --> 3588.8
sense with his wild perpetual claims

3586.4 --> 3590.48
that we don't experience pressure and

3588.8 --> 3592.76
all that although we do experience

3590.48 --> 3595.1
pressure in water and then he talks

3592.76 --> 3597.0200000000004
about gas pressure in his argumentation

3595.1 --> 3598.5699999999997
as to why gas pressure doesn't exist

3597.02 --> 3601.22
sorry

3598.57 --> 3604.19
it's and he's been doing this now for

3601.22 --> 3606.9199999999996
over a week exactly like this he is

3604.19 --> 3611.21
making his own weird little Brenda like

3606.92 --> 3612.89
routine out of it and it's just yeah the

3611.21 --> 3614.86
red flag is up and it's not gonna go

3612.89 --> 3618.77
down sorry

3614.86 --> 3621.86
well he stimulated an argument I think

3618.77 --> 3625.85
and maybe you know he might be he might

3621.86 --> 3627.38
be wrong on the no pressure what is when

3625.85 --> 3628.94
he's explaining temperature and he's

3627.38 --> 3631.9300000000003
going into you know his set people's

3628.94 --> 3635.03
minds thinking into a different way and

3631.93 --> 3637.2799999999997
lack of explain I think that works in

3635.03 --> 3640.8500000000004
purple it with density buoyancy mmm

3637.28 --> 3645.7400000000002
could explain everything just the

3640.85 --> 3648.17
temperature maybe maybe it could let's

3645.74 --> 3653.0899999999997
just see if we get the whole temperature

3648.17 --> 3657.89
set up right then it could give us a

3653.09 --> 3661.1200000000003
yeah a clear overview as to how the

3657.89 --> 3664.25
gradient manifests as it as it does so

3661.12 --> 3665.99
the temperature will probably the full

3664.25 --> 3668.21
understanding of the temperature how it

3665.99 --> 3671.27
all works and interacts will give us a

3668.21 --> 3673.82
much clearer view on why the gradient is

3671.27 --> 3674.32
there the way it is I'm convinced of

3673.82 --> 3677.75
that

3674.32 --> 3680.2400000000002
definitely I think sleeping warrior Tony

3677.75 --> 3683.45
is fully on board with it to now and I

3680.24 --> 3685.58
think with that important of what you

3683.45 --> 3691.0699999999997
see might be as well I'm on board with

3685.58 --> 3693.14
what you said but not frisky no he's got

3691.07 --> 3697.52
to learn to to get a grip on reality

3693.14 --> 3700.22
first and not not be so overly

3697.52 --> 3704.23
enthusiastic in his deconstructive

3700.22 --> 3706.91
approach because it's too far

3704.23 --> 3709.339
right well I better get back to work

3706.91 --> 3712.19
mate I'll never get this what he jumped

3709.339 --> 3714.98
on all right thanks for coming on and

3712.19 --> 3717.7400000000002
all I'll leave you two I think Nathan's

3714.98 --> 3720.25
live as yes he is he's gone live already

3717.74 --> 3722.4199999999996
I'm gonna join him or after this so

3720.25 --> 3724.7
don't forget to tune in tonight to watch

3722.42 --> 3727.4300000000003
my round table I've got Paul on the

3724.7 --> 3729.74
plane coming on hmm okay I will

3727.43 --> 3732.2599999999998
definitely so he's gonna be talking

3729.74 --> 3735.1299999999997
about the NASA moon landings or lack

3732.26 --> 3737.809
thereof lectures you'll say cool

3735.13 --> 3742.42
all right cool all right I'll see you

3737.809 --> 3742.42
later all right thanks for coming Randy

3744.67 --> 3749.5
so I am gonna round out the show as well

3749.829 --> 3754.28
so thanks everyone for coming if you

3752.69 --> 3756.29
like the video then please don't forget

3780.74 --> 3785.5989999999997
I indeed over Mukul and I'm gonna join

3783.77 --> 3787.579
the Flat Earth debates that have already

3785.599 --> 3789.71
started up right after this

3787.579 --> 3793.76
and I will be back tomorrow with Flat

3789.71 --> 3798.13
Earth early-bird number 260 and until

3793.76 --> 3798.13
the next time keep it flat
