84.799 --> 88.64
weather today is

87.04 --> 90.47900000000001
they didn't expect it it's quite

88.64 --> 92.0
beautiful

90.479 --> 95.119
i thought it was going to be a cloudy

92.0 --> 96.32
day because yesterday they were

95.119 --> 98.56
spraying

96.32 --> 100.479
stuff in the sky

98.56 --> 102.88
look just like dusk but it seemed to

100.479 --> 103.67999999999999
have blown away

102.88 --> 105.759
or

103.68 --> 109.759
settled

105.759 --> 112.399
and it's still a very sunny

109.759 --> 114.88
blue sky today

112.399 --> 117.68
despite yesterday so yeah that was a bit

114.88 --> 117.67999999999999
unexpected

118.719 --> 122.15899999999999
it's really beautiful outside

122.399 --> 128.959
it's still a bit of a win though

126.32 --> 131.51999999999998
so it's not like super warm

128.959 --> 134.0
despite the sun but it's still just very

131.52 --> 134.0
nice and

139.04 --> 145.2
i'm gonna enjoy getting groceries

142.4 --> 145.20000000000002
after the show

145.92 --> 149.51999999999998
because i haven't gotten them yet

149.76 --> 153.51899999999998
because i had a bit of a late night

152.08 --> 157.84
again

153.519 --> 157.84
although not as late as yesterday so

158.0 --> 162.959
hello borders boy first in chat good to

160.64 --> 166.64
see you

162.959 --> 170.44
it is thursday the 3rd of

166.64 --> 170.44
march 2022

173.92 --> 179.83999999999997
i'll be having a

176.4 --> 179.84
one and a half hour show

187.04 --> 190.239
anyway yesterday's show

189.28 --> 194.0
was

190.239 --> 197.68
despite being short was pretty good

194.0 --> 199.599
and the flat earth debate man

197.68 --> 204.48000000000002
flat earth debate

199.599 --> 204.48
well the the regular show was okay

205.12 --> 208.959
it was that kind of

207.519 --> 212.159
typical

208.959 --> 213.519
i wasn't really present most of it

212.159 --> 216.0
but

213.519 --> 218.08
yeah when the after show started

216.0 --> 220.239
that's when the real action came in like

218.08 --> 222.4
at some point akuma virus

220.239 --> 225.36
did actually get in the show

222.4 --> 228.72
in the in the discord and nathan went at

225.36 --> 229.84
it holy [ __ ]

228.72 --> 232.72
and

229.84 --> 234.72
that whole thing the whole aftershow was

232.72 --> 237.12
like

234.72 --> 240.319
pretty insane in the sense that

237.12 --> 242.72
i think it all together lasted like six

240.319 --> 245.11999999999998
hours

242.72 --> 247.599
i really wonder how how nathan's gonna

245.12 --> 250.239
cram that all in one premiere

247.599 --> 252.879
because that was the longest every day

250.239 --> 254.879
i've ever sat through

252.879 --> 257.44
it lasted to

254.879 --> 259.59999999999997
eight o'clock

257.44 --> 259.6
it's

259.68 --> 264.16
dutch time

261.04 --> 266.24
that's just like what

264.16 --> 270.0
but yeah because after kumu virus some

266.24 --> 271.759
other guy got in and he was even worse

270.0 --> 274.16
but nathan had just

271.759 --> 274.16
he just

275.199 --> 280.56
yeah

276.72 --> 280.56
i don't know he had a lot of energy

280.639 --> 285.68
it just wouldn't stop it just kept going

282.639 --> 285.68
to eight o'clock so

289.84 --> 293.84
yeah it was one another one of those

291.84 --> 295.52
days

293.84 --> 298.4
a matthew hall

295.52 --> 298.4
jeff gassett

301.12 --> 304.96
but yeah that was pretty intense

307.36 --> 310.6
hey kevlar

324.32 --> 326.56
uh

328.16 --> 332.24
but yeah it was mostly just like

332.4 --> 335.84
oh

334.4 --> 337.75899999999996
oh man

335.84 --> 339.44
hey you got another paypal from flatter

337.759 --> 341.6
sage

339.44 --> 343.84
yesterday oh yeah he said he would do

341.6 --> 343.84000000000003
that

346.4 --> 350.63899999999995
thanks thanks guys

348.24 --> 350.639
this is

350.84 --> 355.59999999999997
like really really helping me out

356.72 --> 361.36
uh

358.4 --> 361.35999999999996
hey adam price

363.36 --> 368.24
so did anybody like

366.88 --> 371.039
uh

368.24 --> 373.84000000000003
ride along in discord during the after

371.039 --> 377.28
show the fed after show yesterday it

373.84 --> 377.28
went on so long

377.6 --> 381.84000000000003
my audio seems to be clipping a bit

383.44 --> 388.639
really

385.28 --> 388.63899999999995
it doesn't look abnormal

390.56 --> 396.88
oh i did just have a

393.68 --> 398.0
an obs update again

396.88 --> 402.919
so

398.0 --> 402.919
hopefully that didn't distort anything

409.599 --> 412.88
sound okay to you all right

413.28 --> 416.79999999999995
yeah if it's clipping if it's actually

415.12 --> 419.599
clipping that's really annoying then

416.8 --> 422.8
please warn me then i have to figure out

419.599 --> 425.8
what to do about it

422.8 --> 425.8
hmm

446.08 --> 451.84
right so

447.84 --> 451.84
anything you guys want to talk about

455.36 --> 457.91900000000004
i'm a bit

458.16 --> 462.84000000000003
in a seeking star wars

465.84 --> 472.0
i'm still sort of halfway waking up but

468.16 --> 472.0
i feel that i do have a lot of energy

476.8 --> 482.879
what did you do last night

479.599 --> 482.87899999999996
uh watch movies

484.24 --> 488.24
i watched like a bit of an older movie

486.96 --> 491.79999999999995
but it was

488.24 --> 491.8
more detective

494.0 --> 497.52
was it called again

495.599 --> 502.87899999999996
zodiac

497.52 --> 505.52
and supposedly based on a real case

502.879 --> 508.16
it was pretty

505.52 --> 510.0
it was kind of scary in a way

508.16 --> 512.5600000000001
it was like about

510.0 --> 512.56
basically

514.24 --> 517.519
a psycho killers

516.32 --> 520.8000000000001
sort of

517.519 --> 522.479
or one that the yeah the people in the

520.8 --> 525.04
movie were trying to figure out at the

522.479 --> 527.6800000000001
press and at the police which were the

525.04 --> 527.68
main focus

529.519 --> 533.68
and i just noticed like how much of a

532.16 --> 534.56
freak like

533.68 --> 536.56
yeah

534.56 --> 539.1199999999999
they he was basically the

536.56 --> 541.76
killer you you never really

539.12 --> 543.6
got to know who he was by the way but

541.76 --> 546.72
just like what he was doing he was

543.6 --> 549.839
literally trolling

546.72 --> 552.32
and i like i kind of like paid attention

549.839 --> 554.8000000000001
to that

552.32 --> 554.8000000000001
i don't know

555.839 --> 559.839
what

557.2 --> 559.839
hey wrath

560.0 --> 565.6
but yeah that was the movie that i got

562.48 --> 565.6
caught watching

566.72 --> 570.32
and it was pretty interesting

571.68 --> 577.519
with some fairly decent acting

574.399 --> 580.16
big in the 70s yeah yeah well it was

577.519 --> 582.88
supposedly historically based

580.16 --> 585.1999999999999
and went through different

582.88 --> 590.08
what went through the events that are

585.2 --> 591.839
supposedly tied in with berzodiac heller

590.08 --> 594.32
not been caught yet you think that's

591.839 --> 594.32
correct

595.12 --> 600.24
it's like inconclusive

597.76 --> 602.48
it's like i have my own little weird sub

600.24 --> 604.8
theory about it just from the feels of

602.48 --> 605.6
it and that is that it was kind of like

604.8 --> 609.04
a

605.6 --> 610.32
that it might have been multiple people

609.04 --> 613.04
that

610.32 --> 616.32
conspired together

613.04 --> 619.8389999999999
to make things confusing to basically

616.32 --> 622.399
both do things

619.839 --> 625.7600000000001
kind of coordinated but coordinated

622.399 --> 628.24
through the media it was just

625.76 --> 632.3199999999999
yeah that's the idea that i got out of

628.24 --> 635.12
it because it was all pretty chaotic

632.32 --> 638.32
it's a complicated puzzle it really is

635.12 --> 638.32
what the movie presented

638.56 --> 643.4399999999999
and if that's based on

640.399 --> 646.0
the real deal then yeah that is a pretty

643.44 --> 648.399
complicated situation

646.0 --> 648.399
anyway

654.88 --> 659.12
right

657.12 --> 661.6
anyway i didn't even know that when i

659.12 --> 663.519
was actually

661.6 --> 665.9200000000001
digging into the movie

663.519 --> 670.04
i basically just

665.92 --> 670.04
kind of clicked on something

683.92 --> 688.399
right because there was a lot of

685.2 --> 690.72
theorizing they were talking about too

688.399 --> 693.279
which was like really interesting to

690.72 --> 694.32
hear that about like

693.279 --> 696.959
how

694.32 --> 699.519
some of these guys that do those letters

696.959 --> 702.3199999999999
sending them they might just be trolls

699.519 --> 704.64
that are just claiming the kills with

702.32 --> 706.6400000000001
really smart

704.64 --> 709.6
like basically back engineered

706.64 --> 712.92
situations that they would present

709.6 --> 712.9200000000001
it's just

722.399 --> 726.72
it was all quite complicated but

724.48 --> 728.8000000000001
interesting not something i really want

726.72 --> 731.8000000000001
to develop on a whole lot it was just

728.8 --> 731.8
something

731.92 --> 737.76
that was interesting to watch for me

734.94 --> 742.9200000000001
[Music]

737.76 --> 742.92
hello knocker norton by the way

763.92 --> 770.3199999999999
gone girl is pretty insane is that your

767.12 --> 774.839
indicator of a good movie

770.32 --> 774.839
it's insane what

831.04 --> 834.04
hmm

845.68 --> 848.68
so

865.12 --> 871.079
hey rick back

867.6 --> 871.0790000000001
good to see you

874.32 --> 877.389
[Music]

884.8 --> 888.959
hey professor phil bell you got an ad

887.04 --> 891.279
for prayers

888.959 --> 894.399
for effective result

891.279 --> 894.399
what do you think about that

895.839 --> 899.839
i think that's quite bizarre

905.92 --> 913.12
i mean are you really gonna pray towards

909.36 --> 916.24
that that seems selfish

913.12 --> 918.24
i mean i think that it might work but

916.24 --> 921.88
like what are you actually praying

918.24 --> 921.88
towards you know

939.12 --> 943.04
so yeah i don't really know about that

941.04 --> 947.079
ad that sounds weird though if you're

943.04 --> 947.079
gonna try that sort of thing

957.04 --> 960.079
hey james mason

962.24 --> 968.44
and flattersage welcome

964.88 --> 968.4399999999999
thanks for the paypal

975.279 --> 979.92
oh god borders boy you don't want to

977.279 --> 979.92
know about that

980.16 --> 984.48
don't talk about that in my chat please

994.079 --> 999.7589999999999
now you pay for the video and they teach

996.639 --> 1001.519
how to pray but yeah what kind of prayer

999.759 --> 1002.8000000000001
professor feel about like is it just

1001.519 --> 1005.519
like hey

1002.8 --> 1007.3599999999999
how to pray successfully to jesus christ

1005.519 --> 1011.36
or god or

1007.36 --> 1015.279
like how to kind of like

1011.36 --> 1016.88
you know when do people start praying

1015.279 --> 1019.68
right it's usually when they're in

1016.88 --> 1022.0
trouble or when they're in pain

1019.68 --> 1024.959
well

1022.0 --> 1027.52
there are probably some tips for

1024.959 --> 1031.3600000000001
yeah how to do that properly

1027.52 --> 1032.8799999999999
like even i kind of give out some sort

1031.36 --> 1034.799
of not

1032.88 --> 1038.4
very very rarely

1034.799 --> 1040.72
and really talk about it but yeah you

1038.4 --> 1043.1200000000001
could train that skill it is basically a

1040.72 --> 1043.1200000000001
skill

1044.0 --> 1049.76
but there's the issue like what are you

1046.24 --> 1053.039
praying to what frequency are you

1049.76 --> 1055.919
tapping into for the action right

1053.039 --> 1057.679
because prayer can have kind of

1055.919 --> 1060.0800000000002
yeah it's basic yeah

1057.679 --> 1062.0800000000002
is the bible warned about that what are

1060.08 --> 1064.48
you praying towards

1062.08 --> 1066.1599999999999
that's basically the question right so

1064.48 --> 1068.32
if it's just going gonna be like i want

1066.16 --> 1070.96
my business to conquer everything and

1068.32 --> 1073.36
just all my enemies to fall is that very

1070.96 --> 1075.76
christian i think that's like praying to

1073.36 --> 1078.8799999999999
another god perhaps if you're gonna get

1075.76 --> 1082.799
success in that and hey

1078.88 --> 1082.7990000000002
that usually comes with the price

1090.64 --> 1092.96
right

1093.84 --> 1100.0
if you're gonna like i'll attempt to

1096.24 --> 1101.52
basically alter reality around you

1100.0 --> 1104.08
through prayer

1101.52 --> 1106.16
that's not just prayer right then you're

1104.08 --> 1108.96
like trying to change things directly

1106.16 --> 1112.48
well how are you to try to change it

1108.96 --> 1116.559
like focusing on what

1112.48 --> 1119.6
and then yeah who like what

1116.559 --> 1121.76
up there is going to basically

1119.6 --> 1123.76
help you out you see

1121.76 --> 1124.799
you got to figure that out if you're

1123.76 --> 1126.08
going to

1124.799 --> 1128.4
if you're going to pray for something

1126.08 --> 1129.84
that's not it's kind of it sounds weird

1128.4 --> 1132.24
right it's almost like a

1129.84 --> 1134.1599999999999
spiritual bureaucracy but

1132.24 --> 1136.32
if you're praying about the wrong thing

1134.16 --> 1138.799
then you're probably gonna have a bit of

1136.32 --> 1138.799
a price

1145.28 --> 1150.76
yeah that's what i'm kind of

1147.76 --> 1150.76
assuming

1162.96 --> 1167.6000000000001
presume it's to god yeah but

1165.36 --> 1168.8799999999999
that's not i'm not talking about to

1167.6 --> 1171.6789999999999
which

1168.88 --> 1174.16
like to a little g or something or like

1171.679 --> 1176.24
a sub god or like a pantheon i'm not

1174.16 --> 1179.2
talking about it talking about

1176.24 --> 1182.0
what it actually is

1179.2 --> 1182.0
that you want

1183.84 --> 1190.3999999999999
right the nature of it to what frequency

1187.44 --> 1190.4
does it resonate

1191.44 --> 1197.2
like what's going to be the the

1193.28 --> 1198.0
influence of your success on the world

1197.2 --> 1201.52
right

1198.0 --> 1201.52
is esoterics

1205.12 --> 1211.36
anyway

1207.84 --> 1211.36
hello bill nye the science denier

1216.08 --> 1219.76
the bible teaches you to pray yeah bill

1218.08 --> 1222.6399999999999
nye designs tonight but it teaches you

1219.76 --> 1224.8799999999999
to pray in a very specific

1222.64 --> 1224.88
way

1233.2 --> 1240.32
do you think satan can give people what

1236.08 --> 1240.32
they want in exchange of their soul yeah

1240.4 --> 1245.3600000000001
effectively

1243.12 --> 1249.2399999999998
it it turns out it's actually a lot

1245.36 --> 1249.24
easier than you think

1251.76 --> 1257.52
right you want something and if you then

1254.24 --> 1259.1200000000001
hellbound focus on that

1257.52 --> 1262.559
then

1259.12 --> 1264.0
you'll probably get it except that on

1262.559 --> 1266.1589999999999
your way there

1264.0 --> 1268.72
you're probably gonna lose a whole bunch

1266.159 --> 1268.72
of things

1268.96 --> 1272.64
that were actually like the support

1271.36 --> 1275.52
energy

1272.64 --> 1277.679
to even make you want it

1275.52 --> 1281.2
so when you have it

1277.679 --> 1281.2
are you still gonna want it

1281.44 --> 1285.3200000000002
right here's the price

1293.36 --> 1298.1999999999998
it's a faustian bargain indeed exactly

1306.799 --> 1310.48
right well what is what yeah those types

1308.72 --> 1313.039
of prayers

1310.48 --> 1315.2
like poetry prayers

1313.039 --> 1317.039
that's just an expression of love that's

1315.2 --> 1319.6000000000001
always good

1317.039 --> 1321.6
or at least it it could be always good

1319.6 --> 1324.32
unless you

1321.6 --> 1326.0
create a dichotomy within it if you

1324.32 --> 1329.2
polarize it like

1326.0 --> 1331.28
this good that bad then already

1329.2 --> 1333.679
it's it's tainted

1331.28 --> 1336.6399999999999
but if it's just pure love towards god

1333.679 --> 1338.64
and and life and all that uniformly then

1336.64 --> 1342.7990000000002
yeah that's good there's no not gonna be

1338.64 --> 1342.7990000000002
a price for that probably the opposite

1344.799 --> 1347.799
right

1355.84 --> 1359.6789999999999
i swear to me what

1358.0 --> 1361.84
you shouldn't joke around with that adam

1359.679 --> 1361.8400000000001
price

1385.12 --> 1390.2399999999998
what

1386.48 --> 1390.24
some teachers are heroes

1394.48 --> 1398.08
special place in health

1401.2 --> 1406.88
special place in hell yeah it's jeff

1403.52 --> 1408.48
gassett that's kind of creepy

1406.88 --> 1410.48
to say that even though you're directing

1408.48 --> 1412.32
it at phil because i consider myself a

1410.48 --> 1416.0
teacher

1412.32 --> 1419.0
i come from a family of teachers

1416.0 --> 1419.0
thanks

1431.919 --> 1435.5200000000002
i'm a moral type well you got to be

1433.84 --> 1437.6
careful with your words even when you

1435.52 --> 1440.72
type them out when you're going to joke

1437.6 --> 1440.7199999999998
about swearing

1444.64 --> 1449.3600000000001
i wouldn't be caught saying that

1447.279 --> 1453.279
like even if it was meant as a joke it's

1449.36 --> 1456.0
not a safe joke for yourself

1453.279 --> 1459.84
not saying that oh i'm offended

1456.0 --> 1459.84
because i get it it's just

1469.6 --> 1473.84
it's what i've heard for bad teachers

1476.799 --> 1481.84
oh yeah well a teacher when they when

1479.279 --> 1484.88
they go rotten and corrupted and like

1481.84 --> 1488.48
possessed by the beast

1484.88 --> 1492.7990000000002
yeah yeah of course then those

1488.48 --> 1492.799
individuals will probably end up in hell

1493.2 --> 1496.64
or

1494.08 --> 1501.48
the abyss wherever

1496.64 --> 1501.48
because they cause a lot of damage

1528.32 --> 1530.6399999999999
hmm

1532.88 --> 1536.96
whoa

1533.76 --> 1536.96
okay kevlar that's

1537.36 --> 1540.6789999999999
that's something

1554.72 --> 1557.84
okay borders boy that's a good question

1556.72 --> 1559.919
so you do

1557.84 --> 1562.799
do you think

1559.919 --> 1564.24
that praying and asking for things

1562.799 --> 1566.08
leaves open

1564.24 --> 1569.44
to satan

1566.08 --> 1569.4399999999998
leaves one open to satan

1569.6 --> 1573.1999999999998
yeah

1570.4 --> 1573.2
potentially

1575.12 --> 1582.7199999999998
i mean especially if you let that action

1578.88 --> 1585.5200000000002
feed more greed right it's all about

1582.72 --> 1587.679
yeah what are you

1585.52 --> 1592.0
what are you gonna do after how how did

1587.679 --> 1592.0
you let it change you in the moment

1593.76 --> 1601.52
so if you're constantly praying for

1596.64 --> 1604.24
wealth for physical gains yeah that's

1601.52 --> 1606.96
you could you could say that leaves you

1604.24 --> 1609.039
open to satan or rather to greed is it

1606.96 --> 1611.039
like is that satan is that like the

1609.039 --> 1614.1589999999999
ultimate destroyer

1611.039 --> 1614.1589999999999
well it's adjacent

1620.88 --> 1625.919
right people that are super greedy that

1623.679 --> 1628.24
it's very like you can't really be a

1625.919 --> 1630.24
good guy right that's how you maintain

1628.24 --> 1632.24
the wealth by not really being a good

1630.24 --> 1634.96
guy

1632.24 --> 1639.4
that's how you stay on top of the pile

1634.96 --> 1639.4
of [ __ ] or money whatever

1640.0 --> 1644.48
right doesn't automatically make you a

1642.24 --> 1646.08
satanist

1644.48 --> 1649.76
or like

1646.08 --> 1653.24
but yeah he will play around with you

1649.76 --> 1653.24
because of that

1664.72 --> 1671.159
okay professor phil bell yeah well yeah

1667.279 --> 1671.159
don't play with those things

1694.88 --> 1698.7990000000002
yeah [ __ ]

1697.12 --> 1702.0
jbdl

1698.799 --> 1702.0
i'm not going anywhere

1707.2 --> 1713.919
i i will not freaking fight russians

1711.279 --> 1716.08
because some insane people in control

1713.919 --> 1718.3200000000002
here

1716.08 --> 1721.4399999999998
that shouldn't be

1718.32 --> 1724.8799999999999
are gonna mandate that which they want

1721.44 --> 1726.0800000000002
it would be too much chaos like it's not

1724.88 --> 1729.1200000000001
set up

1726.08 --> 1729.12
for that to work

1735.679 --> 1738.48
that's ridiculous

1737.2 --> 1741.1200000000001
you can't

1738.48 --> 1744.64
indoctrinate every all your people to

1741.12 --> 1748.2399999999998
become gay and all that trans or garbage

1744.64 --> 1752.039
and then expect a draft for a war to

1748.24 --> 1752.039
work that's preposterous

1759.52 --> 1762.1589999999999
they would be all

1760.96 --> 1764.88
weak

1762.159 --> 1767.919
and probably just cannon fodder just to

1764.88 --> 1770.5590000000002
create more outrage it would be like a

1767.919 --> 1773.76
war sacrifice like oh attack this attack

1770.559 --> 1776.0
this and then oh my god the russians did

1773.76 --> 1779.96
it oh

1776.0 --> 1779.96
it's completely pointless

1787.039 --> 1791.739
so

1788.7 --> 1791.739
[Music]

1806.72 --> 1809.72
so

1818.96 --> 1823.8400000000001
hello where's wally

1820.72 --> 1823.84
what are you doing here

1846.64 --> 1851.2
oh really professor phil bell do you

1848.88 --> 1852.72
know any

1851.2 --> 1856.799
i've heard that

1852.72 --> 1858.159
standard thing said so many times it's

1856.799 --> 1860.8799999999999
i can

1858.159 --> 1863.2
read of you right there

1860.88 --> 1866.64
that you probably don't know any yeah

1863.2 --> 1868.3990000000001
you say oh so many people

1866.64 --> 1870.88
don't have the privilege of eating every

1868.399 --> 1872.9599999999998
day oh really

1870.88 --> 1875.6000000000001
how many do you know

1872.96 --> 1879.72
or is it just a thing you like to say to

1875.6 --> 1879.7199999999998
make people feel guilty

1880.64 --> 1886.519
how many do you actually know confirm it

1898.96 --> 1903.6000000000001
have you ever met a person that didn't

1900.88 --> 1907.3200000000002
eat every day

1903.6 --> 1907.32
because they were poor

1909.36 --> 1912.9599999999998
specifically because they were poor

1917.039 --> 1922.64
i mean i sometimes bring it up over here

1920.159 --> 1924.0800000000002
to kind of like come on guys support me

1922.64 --> 1926.3990000000001
i want to eat

1924.08 --> 1929.6789999999999
and yeah i don't always eat every meal

1926.399 --> 1931.4399999999998
but i do eat or i do eat something

1929.679 --> 1933.679
every day right it's not like i'm

1931.44 --> 1936.159
literally like oh i don't even have any

1933.679 --> 1938.24
bread crumbs or anything no

1936.159 --> 1940.64
i can eat something it's just not going

1938.24 --> 1942.48
to be very good for me

1940.64 --> 1946.3600000000001
if i don't eat enough

1942.48 --> 1946.3600000000001
but it can eat something

1953.919 --> 1960.3200000000002
hello the goods

1956.559 --> 1963.32
have you got ant bad no i don't the

1960.32 --> 1963.32
goods

1967.519 --> 1974.08
any reason why not this

1969.84 --> 1974.08
yeah why do you think it's all a dud

1975.519 --> 1978.48
it's ridiculous

1979.36 --> 1985.12
you're never gonna give the money it's a

1981.519 --> 1988.32
trick setup we know it is

1985.12 --> 1990.559
ballers don't give money for challenges

1988.32 --> 1994.72
to prove the earth is flat

1990.559 --> 1997.2
they never do why would anybody

1994.72 --> 1999.1200000000001
be dumb enough to fall for a trick set

1997.2 --> 2002.0800000000002
up like that so you can

1999.12 --> 2005.5189999999998
try to reap more attention from that

2002.08 --> 2007.84
it's all garbage we're not falling for

2005.519 --> 2011.1200000000001
your stupid little traps because we're

2007.84 --> 2013.279
not [ __ ] you are [ __ ]

2011.12 --> 2018.5189999999998
for thinking that people are actually

2013.279 --> 2018.519
gonna buy such nonsense from you

2023.76 --> 2029.919
many refugees in africa oh really

2027.2 --> 2033.919
oh did you meet them

2029.919 --> 2036.64
or did you see something that was filmed

2033.919 --> 2039.6000000000001
and you can't really know

2036.64 --> 2042.6000000000001
from where or when that was actually

2039.6 --> 2042.6
filmed

2046.08 --> 2049.64
professor field

2061.52 --> 2070.0
is that my official line what

2065.76 --> 2073.0
you have met them really when

2070.0 --> 2073.0
where

2079.44 --> 2082.32
where were they from

2083.76 --> 2086.5600000000004
i mean were they

2086.839 --> 2091.7599999999998
like from

2090.159 --> 2093.52
from those areas where there's like

2091.76 --> 2095.5200000000004
tribal wars

2093.52 --> 2097.119
because yeah they get pretty brutal and

2095.52 --> 2097.92
they just starve each other out they

2097.119 --> 2100.4
just

2097.92 --> 2103.839
like run over run the village and send

2100.4 --> 2103.839
everybody into the woods

2103.92 --> 2108.96
and then they don't have any direct food

2106.56 --> 2113.52
sources anymore right that would starve

2108.96 --> 2113.52
that's a reason ethiopia

2114.079 --> 2117.8390000000004
1980s

2115.68 --> 2117.839
right

2119.119 --> 2123.359
that's in the 80s though

2121.44 --> 2125.76
yeah

2123.359 --> 2127.119
the way you presented your little

2125.76 --> 2129.28
sentence

2127.119 --> 2131.2000000000003
sounded like oh there's people starving

2129.28 --> 2133.3590000000004
right now right that was my point yeah i

2131.2 --> 2135.04
know there were definitely ethiopians

2133.359 --> 2137.2
starving in the 80s

2135.04 --> 2139.599
yeah

2137.2 --> 2142.48
i think i've even met one of those right

2139.599 --> 2145.28
there was like a whole big thing then

2142.48 --> 2147.44
but that's not the standard it's not the

2145.28 --> 2148.8
default it's not like there's countries

2147.44 --> 2152.2400000000002
where it's just yeah there's just

2148.8 --> 2154.96
constantly starving people like no

2152.24 --> 2154.9599999999996
no there isn't

2155.92 --> 2160.48
by the drought yes i know i remember

2157.92 --> 2164.48
that professor fill bell right but you

2160.48 --> 2164.48
were talking about it like it's now

2164.64 --> 2169.839
right you're bringing it up now

2167.28 --> 2171.599
oh you should be so happy

2169.839 --> 2173.44
there's people starving out there don't

2171.599 --> 2174.48
be so thankless

2173.44 --> 2177.04
really

2174.48 --> 2178.64
so do you know anybody out there right

2177.04 --> 2180.64
now

2178.64 --> 2182.64
that was actually my question not about

2180.64 --> 2185.359
what you witnessed

2182.64 --> 2190.68
40 years ago

2185.359 --> 2190.68
right it's a bit of a time gap there

2211.04 --> 2214.04
so

2214.56 --> 2220.56
for you to own no but we don't

2217.28 --> 2222.8
hey hr 42

2220.56 --> 2226.599
we don't need to

2222.8 --> 2226.599
own the globetarts

2231.119 --> 2236.4
we don't need no globe control

2235.599 --> 2239.599
yeah

2236.4 --> 2242.839
it's because we've won

2239.599 --> 2242.839
get it

2242.88 --> 2249.48
we've won

2244.72 --> 2249.48
just leave the flat earth alone

2262.16 --> 2266.7999999999997
seriously why would we

2265.2 --> 2269.839
go over

2266.8 --> 2271.2000000000003
to some silly anti-flat earther channel

2269.839 --> 2274.24
and

2271.2 --> 2276.7999999999997
participate in a challenge

2274.24 --> 2279.2799999999997
when you already know you're going to be

2276.8 --> 2281.52
made to look like an ass one way or

2279.28 --> 2284.8
another because you know that even

2281.52 --> 2287.52
though you can absolutely win in many

2284.8 --> 2289.44
ways many different ways

2287.52 --> 2292.0
it's never going to be recognized you're

2289.44 --> 2294.56
just going to have to deal with double

2292.0 --> 2296.64
speaking [ __ ] again

2294.56 --> 2299.68
and sidetracking

2296.64 --> 2302.56
endless endless side tracking

2299.68 --> 2304.64
leaving you with absolutely not getting

2302.56 --> 2307.04
that money and then

2304.64 --> 2309.1189999999997
like even if you're made it look like a

2307.04 --> 2312.48
win not getting the money is still going

2309.119 --> 2315.04
to be making you look like a fool

2312.48 --> 2318.16
gonna make me feel stupid if i do that

2315.04 --> 2320.56
so why would you do that

2318.16 --> 2321.68
what what will you get out of it like

2320.56 --> 2324.88
what

2321.68 --> 2327.2
does going on a global channel

2324.88 --> 2329.119
to supposedly prove a flat earth gonna

2327.2 --> 2330.7999999999997
get you when you know they're never

2329.119 --> 2332.079
gonna recognize it that's why they are

2330.8 --> 2334.0
what they are

2332.079 --> 2335.119
that's why they have that channel to do

2334.0 --> 2337.839
that

2335.119 --> 2340.8
they're like politically inclined to

2337.839 --> 2343.839
never surrender no matter the cost even

2340.8 --> 2347.6800000000003
if it literally costs their own mind

2343.839 --> 2347.68
why would you engage with that

2348.24 --> 2351.4399999999996
what are you going to get out of that

2350.4 --> 2353.76
nothing

2351.44 --> 2356.96
it's a waste of time definitely not

2353.76 --> 2356.96
going to get money out of it

2358.32 --> 2363.48
because

2359.599 --> 2363.48
globers don't pay

2374.64 --> 2379.1189999999997
and doesn't the same go for nathan's

2377.359 --> 2381.839
channel what

2379.119 --> 2383.839
well what money price has he promised i

2381.839 --> 2387.359
mean david weiss

2383.839 --> 2390.64
is supposedly a bitcoin challenge right

2387.359 --> 2393.7599999999998
but that's a true but that's actually a

2390.64 --> 2396.72
trick setup it's like kind of

2393.76 --> 2400.7200000000003
open like hey this is

2396.72 --> 2404.0789999999997
exactly impossible to succeed like this

2400.72 --> 2405.52
you'd have to it's a kobe marathon or

2404.079 --> 2407.8390000000004
yeah

2405.52 --> 2411.2
start it's an unwinnable scenario and

2407.839 --> 2413.2799999999997
it's laid out exactly why

2411.2 --> 2415.1189999999997
right it's not like oh we're hiding it

2413.28 --> 2417.76
no it's like this is why it's all

2415.119 --> 2417.76
impossible

2418.56 --> 2423.52
you can't overcome that you can't figure

2421.2 --> 2426.319
out a way to overcome that

2423.52 --> 2428.4
it'll just go straight into academics

2426.319 --> 2431.839
and fallacy nature

2428.4 --> 2435.76
right this it's unovercomeable

2431.839 --> 2437.599
you cannot overcome that ballers i

2435.76 --> 2440.4
as baldwin

2437.599 --> 2444.96
master of the ball universe

2440.4 --> 2448.1600000000003
i can't overcome it it's unwinnable

2444.96 --> 2449.52
it's mechanically impossible to win that

2448.16 --> 2452.0789999999997
yeah

2449.52 --> 2454.48
now we know that mctoon's challenge

2452.079 --> 2456.88
attempts to mimic like it's the same

2454.48 --> 2459.28
thing exact except it's exactly the

2456.88 --> 2461.839
opposite

2459.28 --> 2462.7200000000003
it's very winnable

2461.839 --> 2464.319
but

2462.72 --> 2466.64
we already know that

2464.319 --> 2468.48
he's never going to pay out there's just

2466.64 --> 2471.44
no way

2468.48 --> 2473.68
like why would he why would anybody do

2471.44 --> 2473.68
that

2474.4 --> 2479.28
from a baller perspective why would

2476.319 --> 2481.44
anybody do that

2479.28 --> 2484.0
you're constantly fighting against that

2481.44 --> 2486.56
which cannot be overcome just not giving

2484.0 --> 2488.88
up never give up never surrender but

2486.56 --> 2491.52
it's a lost fight though the war can

2488.88 --> 2493.52
never be won

2491.52 --> 2496.56
well why would you then just give away a

2493.52 --> 2496.56
whole bunch of money

2497.52 --> 2501.44
to

2498.4 --> 2505.319
the ones you're losing the war with

2501.44 --> 2505.319
it makes no sense

2508.96 --> 2515.7200000000003
oh [ __ ] up

2511.359 --> 2515.72
it's not wasting my time ass

2526.56 --> 2528.88
ah

2529.28 --> 2533.88
right

2530.24 --> 2533.8799999999997
hey terry 306.

2562.72 --> 2571.68
oakley is flat earth 4p i'm sure

2567.839 --> 2573.7599999999998
oh really so he just switched

2571.68 --> 2576.319
really

2573.76 --> 2578.88
oh knocker norton just goes to show you

2576.319 --> 2580.64
have very little insight on how things

2578.88 --> 2583.52
really work

2580.64 --> 2583.52
if that's what you're

2590.839 --> 2596.64
thinking so you think flat earth has won

2593.44 --> 2596.64
the war yeah

2596.8 --> 2602.4
intellectually

2598.68 --> 2606.24
argumentatively bobby steals absolutely

2602.4 --> 2606.2400000000002
we've won it 100

2607.68 --> 2611.2
we've won that

2608.88 --> 2612.56
100 percent

2611.2 --> 2614.72
it's no

2612.56 --> 2617.04
no person no one percent a half a

2614.72 --> 2618.56
percent not a millionth

2617.04 --> 2621.2799999999997
of a percent

2618.56 --> 2623.2799999999997
left

2621.28 --> 2626.2400000000002
there's no hope for the globe because

2623.28 --> 2626.2400000000002
it's not true

2626.319 --> 2629.359
and it's provable

2627.92 --> 2631.76
in every

2629.359 --> 2633.68
in every corner in every part the game

2631.76 --> 2635.599
is up

2633.68 --> 2638.0789999999997
but yeah that's not the game that you're

2635.599 --> 2641.119
playing that you're playing the game

2638.079 --> 2644.0
of let's hold on to this until we drive

2641.119 --> 2646.4
everybody insane and then use the

2644.0 --> 2648.64
amnesia momentum

2646.4 --> 2650.88
and the newly sprouted ignorance from

2648.64 --> 2652.8799999999997
sheer stress to to indoctrinate

2650.88 --> 2654.56
everybody into believing this [ __ ]

2652.88 --> 2655.76
[ __ ] again

2654.56 --> 2658.0789999999997
yeah

2655.76 --> 2663.0
that's a psychological war

2658.079 --> 2663.0
it's not an argumentative war

2663.119 --> 2667.6800000000003
it's not an intellectual word it's

2665.28 --> 2667.6800000000003
pure

2667.839 --> 2671.68
cult

2668.88 --> 2673.76
social engineering

2671.68 --> 2676.64
manipulation

2673.76 --> 2679.5200000000004
psychology based it's an infowar that

2676.64 --> 2679.52
you are committing

2681.28 --> 2685.2000000000003
what will be the effect of winning

2685.599 --> 2689.44
the effect is is that you're in a dead

2688.16 --> 2691.44
end

2689.44 --> 2692.56
intellectually

2691.44 --> 2696.079
but

2692.56 --> 2698.88
yeah since everybody is heavily

2696.079 --> 2701.04
integrated into a giant indoctrination

2698.88 --> 2705.119
system

2701.04 --> 2707.2799999999997
right from which your conviction sprouts

2705.119 --> 2709.839
well you're still gonna be able to enjoy

2707.28 --> 2712.8
that while it lasts as the entire

2709.839 --> 2716.16
society on which all that is based on is

2712.8 --> 2718.7200000000003
literally disintegrating visibly over

2716.16 --> 2723.1189999999997
time

2718.72 --> 2723.1189999999997
being driven insane it's like

2724.16 --> 2728.3999999999996
being driven insane

2726.079 --> 2731.3590000000004
being made more self-destructive like

2728.4 --> 2733.6800000000003
what's going to be left

2731.359 --> 2736.24
of this globe belief

2733.68 --> 2736.24
like this

2737.04 --> 2741.52
when the only ones that will just

2738.8 --> 2743.04
casually accept it are so demonically

2741.52 --> 2745.599
possessed

2743.04 --> 2747.2
you don't even want them associated

2745.599 --> 2748.7200000000003
that's all that's going to be all that's

2747.2 --> 2751.7599999999998
left

2748.72 --> 2752.7999999999997
to buy into that [ __ ] eventually

2751.76 --> 2755.28
just

2752.8 --> 2757.28
savage demon-possessed people

2755.28 --> 2760.079
that are a giant

2757.28 --> 2763.079
giant problem for everybody the entire

2760.079 --> 2763.079
world

2784.64 --> 2789.359
it doesn't impact anything then oh you

2786.96 --> 2792.4
think so no it does

2789.359 --> 2795.839
what it impacts is

2792.4 --> 2795.839
you're never going to escape

2796.0 --> 2800.96
a bunch of priests that are spell

2798.24 --> 2803.839
weaving what you assume to be a reality

2800.96 --> 2803.839
for you

2804.48 --> 2808.319
you're never going to grow out of it

2806.0 --> 2810.48
it's never going to actually become real

2808.319 --> 2813.04
it's always going to stay pretend every

2810.48 --> 2813.04
part of it

2813.28 --> 2816.96
every part is going to be an act every

2814.96 --> 2817.76
part is going to be a suggestive stage

2816.96 --> 2820.96
show

2817.76 --> 2824.0
to reinforce pieces of your

2820.96 --> 2827.359
dream belief

2824.0 --> 2827.359
or attempting to do that

2828.48 --> 2832.88
but it's never going to be real that's

2830.8 --> 2833.76
that's the end result

2832.88 --> 2835.2000000000003
of

2833.76 --> 2838.8
losing

2835.2 --> 2838.7999999999997
the intellectual conflict

2839.2 --> 2844.5589999999997
because when you lose the intellectual

2840.88 --> 2846.8
conflict that means that it's actually

2844.559 --> 2850.6400000000003
really flat

2846.8 --> 2853.2000000000003
like actually it's really flat like not

2850.64 --> 2858.2799999999997
oh imagine a model oh no

2853.2 --> 2858.2799999999997
look around it's actually flat

2858.88 --> 2863.2000000000003
despite everything and all your dreams

2861.119 --> 2865.44
and all the things that you want to be

2863.2 --> 2866.64
possible that you've bought into and

2865.44 --> 2869.04
it's your

2866.64 --> 2871.2799999999997
dreams that you've connected to what you

2869.04 --> 2873.119
see as potential reality

2871.28 --> 2874.7200000000003
in your dream world

2873.119 --> 2877.119
yeah

2874.72 --> 2880.0
you've connected to things based on

2877.119 --> 2882.96
faulty foundations

2880.0 --> 2885.359
and that's never gonna go away that that

2882.96 --> 2890.2
remains like that

2885.359 --> 2890.2
because the earth is actually flat

2911.119 --> 2915.6400000000003
oh sure lydia logs

2915.68 --> 2923.52
an unmanned craft to go to the moon

2919.44 --> 2928.0
test systems oh yeah

2923.52 --> 2930.64
i'm sure that's going to be very real

2928.0 --> 2932.8
it's not just going to be a complete

2930.64 --> 2933.92
staged

2932.8 --> 2935.04
like

2933.92 --> 2937.839
3d

2935.04 --> 2940.24
simulation or anything

2937.839 --> 2942.48
to make it super cheap like to really

2940.24 --> 2946.0
wreak in all that cash from everything

2942.48 --> 2949.52
and then just provide really good cgi

2946.0 --> 2951.68
which will make people buy it

2949.52 --> 2953.28
right that's the big trick giant amounts

2951.68 --> 2956.319
of money for

2953.28 --> 2958.3190000000004
supposedly being able to do something

2956.319 --> 2960.64
physically

2958.319 --> 2964.48
but then not actually doing it and

2960.64 --> 2964.48
instead presenting cgi

2964.72 --> 2971.7599999999998
that's just really convincing

2967.92 --> 2974.079
and very cheap in comparison

2971.76 --> 2976.8
that's the industry

2974.079 --> 2978.96
that's space industry

2976.8 --> 2981.04
that's the winning formula

2978.96 --> 2984.48
right it was the winning formula for the

2981.04 --> 2985.7599999999998
mars rover project remember that oh

2984.48 --> 2986.559
yeah

2985.76 --> 2989.92
yeah

2986.559 --> 2989.92
that was what it is

2990.079 --> 2994.96
it was a winning formula worked very

2992.0 --> 2998.8
effectively except in those days it was

2994.96 --> 3002.0
like almost too early to do that because

2998.8 --> 3004.88
people haven't weren't just yet super

3002.0 --> 3007.52
stressed out and deranged enough yet to

3004.88 --> 3011.119
just buy it quickly

3007.52 --> 3012.48
there were still doubts but is this real

3011.119 --> 3014.079
out there because

3012.48 --> 3016.48
the strain

3014.079 --> 3019.2000000000003
worldwide on the people wasn't high

3016.48 --> 3019.2
enough yet

3022.0 --> 3025.599
right now

3023.359 --> 3028.48
everybody's almost like halfway out of

3025.599 --> 3030.7200000000003
their minds a lot of people or like

3028.48 --> 3033.44
physically

3030.72 --> 3037.04
damaged making things worse

3033.44 --> 3039.359
so now pulling such pranks just pure cgi

3037.04 --> 3041.7599999999998
giant scoop of money and just presenting

3039.359 --> 3044.4
pure cgi it's gonna work a whole lot

3041.76 --> 3047.28
easier because people don't really have

3044.4 --> 3052.119
the faculties anymore

3047.28 --> 3052.119
to deal with figuring it out

3061.119 --> 3066.92
that's right matthew hall see how easy

3063.68 --> 3066.9199999999996
that is

3073.839 --> 3076.5589999999997
look at that

3077.76 --> 3080.8
that's just

3081.599 --> 3085.76
in funny cold

3083.119 --> 3087.2000000000003
weirdly cold project project unto me

3085.76 --> 3089.28
fundy

3087.2 --> 3090.8799999999997
project for me

3089.28 --> 3093.8390000000004
throw it all out

3090.88 --> 3096.48
now wear it the flat earth is the cold

3093.839 --> 3101.319
wear the wrong ones we don't understand

3096.48 --> 3101.319
project it onto me fundy come on

3117.2 --> 3120.2
hmm

3132.48 --> 3136.079
a cgi is real

3136.8 --> 3140.96
we should fake our own moon mission

3141.599 --> 3146.839
i don't think we're gonna get permission

3143.28 --> 3146.8390000000004
for that geoshifter

3152.72 --> 3157.7599999999998
now not if you actually want to do like

3154.88 --> 3161.599
a physical out there thing

3157.76 --> 3161.599
right to support the cgi

3161.92 --> 3167.119
i mean you could probably make a little

3164.64 --> 3170.16
movie that

3167.119 --> 3172.0
just says like oh look we're launching

3170.16 --> 3174.64
this rocket

3172.0 --> 3176.88
and it's just all cgi yeah you could try

3174.64 --> 3176.8799999999997
that

3177.92 --> 3181.2400000000002
i don't know

3182.48 --> 3185.359
it's because it's organized that it

3184.0 --> 3186.559
works so well

3185.359 --> 3188.7999999999997
anyway

3186.559 --> 3191.599
thank you jd for the

3188.8 --> 3193.44
for the super chat

3191.599 --> 3195.28

3193.44 --> 3198.079
channel though please support me through

3195.28 --> 3199.6800000000003

3202.88 --> 3206.88
because that really helps support me

3205.04 --> 3208.88
financially

3206.88 --> 3211.119
keep me going

3208.88 --> 3213.92
super chats are really only like a

3211.119 --> 3216.0
billboard i don't effectively receive

3213.92 --> 3217.6800000000003
anything out of that

3216.0 --> 3219.119
but thank you

3217.68 --> 3222.1189999999997
for the gesture

3219.119 --> 3222.119
jd

3237.92 --> 3241.92
climate scams are the new hotness

3243.599 --> 3246.0
well it's

3246.64 --> 3250.68
pretty much on the same level

3252.4 --> 3256.7200000000003
although it's much more invasive

3254.72 --> 3259.68
and destructive really

3256.72 --> 3259.68
climate scams

3260.559 --> 3266.88
i mean wasting a lot of money on cgi

3264.319 --> 3269.44
is not necessarily all that

3266.88 --> 3271.04
environmentally destructive

3269.44 --> 3271.92
right

3271.04 --> 3275.359
but

3271.92 --> 3275.359
yeah rearranging

3276.16 --> 3281.04
like factories like

3279.119 --> 3284.079
production standards

3281.04 --> 3288.599
based on a faulty premise yeah that's

3284.079 --> 3288.599
actually really bad for the environment

3301.119 --> 3305.28
poor propagandist a new thing

3303.28 --> 3307.8390000000004
now that's not new that's a very old

3305.28 --> 3307.8390000000004
thing

3317.839 --> 3323.2
i mean the medium for it changes right

3321.92 --> 3325.599
but

3323.2 --> 3327.7599999999998
like during world war ii i betcha there

3325.599 --> 3331.44
was a whole bunch of war propaganda and

3327.76 --> 3331.44
it all just went through radio

3332.72 --> 3336.8799999999997
so that's not a new thing

3334.88 --> 3337.6800000000003
it's a very old thing

3336.88 --> 3340.0
right

3337.68 --> 3341.2
they just use whatever method is

3340.0 --> 3344.559
available

3341.2 --> 3347.5989999999997
before the radio you would hand out

3344.559 --> 3347.599
printed papers

3347.76 --> 3351.3590000000004
and before there was a printing press to

3350.079 --> 3353.52
do that

3351.359 --> 3355.7599999999998
you'd have a lot of good speakers that

3353.52 --> 3358.16
would go get on street corners and just

3355.76 --> 3361.1600000000003
chant it whatever you needed

3358.16 --> 3361.16
yeah

3362.48 --> 3368.28
so

3363.44 --> 3368.28
war propaganda is very old

3398.16 --> 3402.0
how did we arrive at the point where

3399.839 --> 3405.2799999999997
western mainstream media propaganda is

3402.0 --> 3410.0
defending nazis uh

3405.28 --> 3412.559
because they were kind of always nazis

3410.0 --> 3414.48
double speaking nazis

3412.559 --> 3417.48
projecting

3414.48 --> 3417.48
right

3420.64 --> 3425.52
it's basically like the mainstream media

3423.76 --> 3427.44
is like

3425.52 --> 3429.68
the nazi propagandists that call

3427.44 --> 3431.76
everybody a nazi

3429.68 --> 3434.0
like you're it you're the nazi you're

3431.76 --> 3436.4
the bad man because you don't cooperate

3434.0 --> 3438.88
with us and that's kind of a nazi thing

3436.4 --> 3438.88
to do

3440.4 --> 3447.839
except like the nazis didn't accuse

3443.359 --> 3447.839
others of being nazis in their day

3447.92 --> 3453.599
that's the new method now

3451.359 --> 3456.799
it's nazis accusing others of being

3453.599 --> 3456.799
nazis that's what it is

3457.04 --> 3462.4
but that's what it kind of has been like

3459.359 --> 3462.4
for a while now

3462.96 --> 3469.359
it's just grown more

3465.04 --> 3473.319
it's just came out of the glo the closet

3469.359 --> 3473.319
it's more overt now

3492.799 --> 3496.68
what are you talking about

3511.6 --> 3514.739
[Music]

3515.52 --> 3520.079
oh right yeah geoshifter geoshifter was

3518.24 --> 3521.839
all over it

3520.079 --> 3524.1600000000003
with this spacecam

3521.839 --> 3525.52
yeah if you just want to make a website

3524.16 --> 3527.2
and just claim there's something

3525.52 --> 3528.4
happening yeah that's

3527.2 --> 3531.5589999999997
legal

3528.4 --> 3531.559
i guess

3531.839 --> 3535.2799999999997
i was just saying that if you wanted to

3533.599 --> 3537.76
actually have

3535.28 --> 3540.3190000000004
like some rocket launch somewhere

3537.76 --> 3543.5200000000004
physically out there right a

3540.319 --> 3544.96
balloon rocket and all that

3543.52 --> 3546.48
yeah

3544.96 --> 3548.559
that's where you need the connections

3546.48 --> 3550.4
but if you just want to make a website

3548.559 --> 3554.8390000000004
claiming their space launches and all

3550.4 --> 3554.839
that yeah that's legal apparently

3571.839 --> 3574.839
what

3600.079 --> 3603.76
a lot of mainstream media is about

3601.599 --> 3605.52
attention

3603.76 --> 3610.079
to generate cash

3605.52 --> 3610.079
right infotainment jd it has a word

3610.799 --> 3614.24
right

3611.76 --> 3615.599
i think like the early 20th century 21st

3614.24 --> 3618.0
century

3615.599 --> 3620.319
there was this thing that happened i

3618.0 --> 3622.64
still remember it even being said on

3620.319 --> 3624.799
alex jones

3622.64 --> 3626.799
how

3624.799 --> 3630.319
what was late 90s i don't remember

3626.799 --> 3632.16
somewhere it changed where news

3630.319 --> 3634.4
doesn't necessarily like a news

3632.16 --> 3637.2
organization doesn't have to tell the

3634.4 --> 3637.2000000000003
truth anymore

3638.96 --> 3644.2400000000002
it's real yeah it's like the hippocratic

3641.52 --> 3646.64
oath for doctors that suddenly you don't

3644.24 --> 3648.72
have to do that anymore which is

3646.64 --> 3650.72
absolutely insane

3648.72 --> 3652.799
well the same thing happened for news

3650.72 --> 3654.5589999999997
media they didn't necessarily have to

3652.799 --> 3659.119
tell the truth anymore

3654.559 --> 3661.599
if they would mark it as advertisement

3659.119 --> 3662.559
so that's how infotainment came into

3661.599 --> 3664.6400000000003
being

3662.559 --> 3665.92
and that's kind the infotainment was

3664.64 --> 3667.2799999999997
like the

3665.92 --> 3669.52
foundation

3667.28 --> 3672.7200000000003
for the mainstream media

3669.52 --> 3675.7599999999998
how it's grown to function legally you

3672.72 --> 3679.68
see that's their legal backing

3675.76 --> 3683.96
is that they're actually infotainment

3679.68 --> 3683.96
pretending to be news

3684.559 --> 3688.48
email check my email okay

3691.359 --> 3695.24
there's nothing in my email

3706.16 --> 3713.319
and that's something got in the spam

3708.48 --> 3713.319
folder no there's nothing here

3726.96 --> 3731.599
ah

3728.48 --> 3733.2
oh professor phil bell thanks

3731.599 --> 3736.599

yes yes sorry my sound i know

3796.72 --> 3803.2
i moved it and then it turned off again

3799.2 --> 3803.2
oh you're so reliable

3806.799 --> 3812.079
yeah it is i think it is the connection

3808.88 --> 3814.1600000000003
cable or it's rather it's not the cable

3812.079 --> 3816.6400000000003
it's the socket

3814.16 --> 3820.44
it's the socket of this mic that's kind

3816.64 --> 3820.44
of like wobbly

3851.52 --> 3856.839
hey gorzilla

3853.2 --> 3856.839
good servant too

3870.64 --> 3873.64
so

3902.799 --> 3907.48
ah man getting hungry

3913.599 --> 3916.599
um

3930.4 --> 3936.119
yeah i appreciate you guys are willing

3932.48 --> 3936.119
to kind of like

3938.72 --> 3942.16
at least like

3940.079 --> 3945.119
not go immediately into a fight with

3942.16 --> 3948.5589999999997
each other here in this chat

3945.119 --> 3950.559
like with the ballers that are just

3948.559 --> 3952.96
behaving here

3950.559 --> 3955.599
i do apprec because i know i know how

3952.96 --> 3957.599
hard things can get like in other chats

3955.599 --> 3960.0
i see you guys out there

3957.599 --> 3961.839
and i appreciate that you're like

3960.0 --> 3963.76
in understanding

3961.839 --> 3965.2
that in here we're supposed to kind of

3963.76 --> 3967.5200000000004
behave

3965.2 --> 3969.4399999999996
and i appreciate you guys like basically

3967.52 --> 3971.119
uphold your part in that

3969.44 --> 3973.839
i know it's very challenging because

3971.119 --> 3975.119
normally with these guys you go at it in

3973.839 --> 3979.839
other chats

3975.119 --> 3979.839
and i appreciate your holding back here

3979.92 --> 3985.6800000000003
i would look great on a harley davidson

3983.44 --> 3985.68
uh

3987.76 --> 3991.0
i guess

3999.599 --> 4004.599
i'm not really as a motor guy though

4010.319 --> 4014.799
and personally i think that i don't like

4012.559 --> 4018.2000000000003
how loud harley davidsons

4014.799 --> 4018.2
tend to be

4022.24 --> 4026.72
but yeah just they look like pretty cool

4025.039 --> 4028.7990000000004
machines when they're all shiny and all

4026.72 --> 4030.72
that yeah sure i'd look great on a

4028.799 --> 4032.4
harley davidson for like a photo shoot

4030.72 --> 4035.839
or something but i'm not a harley

4032.4 --> 4035.839
davidson guy really

4041.68 --> 4047.1189999999997
i love the harley sound

4044.72 --> 4050.64
yeah sure at a distance

4047.119 --> 4050.6400000000003
that's just too freaking loud

4052.0 --> 4061.0
like i have sensitive ears

4056.0 --> 4061.0
i don't like super loud [ __ ]

4070.72 --> 4077.4399999999996
right on the other hand an actual horse

4074.799 --> 4078.64
that will be epic i know actually how to

4077.44 --> 4080.96
write those

4078.64 --> 4083.96
and they don't make giant amounts of

4080.96 --> 4083.96
sound

4090.799 --> 4096.88
what sort of car do i like if what

4094.96 --> 4099.44
well that depends on if it's actually

4096.88 --> 4103.1990000000005
just a general go about car

4099.44 --> 4104.5599999999995
or if it's a giant penis uh car you know

4103.199 --> 4107.12
like

4104.56 --> 4109.279
all depends i mean i have like penis

4107.12 --> 4111.92
cars that i really like i think are

4109.279 --> 4113.52
freaking awesome

4111.92 --> 4116.08
like

4113.52 --> 4119.1990000000005
a corvette z06

4116.08 --> 4121.679
or whatever later version

4119.199 --> 4125.04
but it's the design really that's like

4121.679 --> 4126.96
oh that's freaking awesome

4125.04 --> 4128.56
right but that's not like really like oh

4126.96 --> 4131.52
yeah of course i'm gonna go for that

4128.56 --> 4136.319
card uh no

4131.52 --> 4136.319
but yeah when it comes to just a car

4137.52 --> 4142.400000000001
i don't know i really like my old car

4140.56 --> 4144.799
that i inherited from my mother was a

4142.4 --> 4146.96
great car seat sucks so it's small but

4144.799 --> 4149.44
it had a lot of power

4146.96 --> 4152.88
it's like small but feisty

4149.44 --> 4155.5199999999995
and not freaking gay in some way right

4152.88 --> 4156.56
because there's those types designs as

4155.52 --> 4158.400000000001
well

4156.56 --> 4161.839000000001
ugh

4158.4 --> 4161.839
you'd never catch me in a subaru

4163.52 --> 4167.040000000001
or yeah you know what i mean

4171.679 --> 4174.679
what

4184.48 --> 4189.599999999999
afraid of horses

4187.199 --> 4192.08
something about their no their eyes are

4189.6 --> 4194.320000000001
so good

4192.08 --> 4197.76
they're oh but you gotta realize that

4194.32 --> 4198.96
they have like a pretty big soul

4197.76 --> 4201.280000000001
right

4198.96 --> 4204.08
so that thing that's creeping you out in

4201.28 --> 4207.12
their eyes that's probably some like

4204.08 --> 4211.76
personal things that you see

4207.12 --> 4211.76
like horses can be very revealing

4214.239 --> 4218.159
spiritually they're they're kind of

4216.159 --> 4220.719
spiritual animals

4218.159 --> 4220.719
in ways

4224.56 --> 4228.2390000000005
right but the horses can for example

4226.64 --> 4230.8
actually

4228.239 --> 4232.879999999999
like contract trauma and all that and

4230.8 --> 4234.88
then they will like carry that with them

4232.88 --> 4235.92
it will start to shine out of their eyes

4234.88 --> 4238.4800000000005
it's

4235.92 --> 4239.679
they're very

4238.48 --> 4242.879999999999
open

4239.679 --> 4245.4400000000005
about their feelings what they send out

4242.88 --> 4247.6
horses

4245.44 --> 4249.599999999999
right they're very expressive i like it

4247.6 --> 4253.159000000001
about them you always know where to

4249.6 --> 4253.159000000001
stand with a horse

4259.6 --> 4265.320000000001
because you can read them easily

4262.32 --> 4265.32
anyway

4275.92 --> 4279.4800000000005
why the longest

4288.239 --> 4292.08
yeah if you guys want me to have some

4290.0 --> 4294.56
kind of big card yeah you're definitely

4292.08 --> 4296.96
gonna have to up the super chats or the

4294.56 --> 4299.52
paypals a lot

4296.96 --> 4303.36
because i

4299.52 --> 4308.080000000001
you know i have other priorities

4303.36 --> 4310.32
like hey maybe some new attire

4308.08 --> 4313.6
like that will be great new pants new

4310.32 --> 4316.32
boots maybe a new jacket

4313.6 --> 4319.120000000001
that's a little bit more in my

4316.32 --> 4323.12
like this that will be quicker into my

4319.12 --> 4323.12
price range as like a new car

4324.159 --> 4330.159
five bucks at a time well yeah if

4325.92 --> 4330.159
everybody give me five bucks like every

4330.8 --> 4335.04
every day but yeah that means like

4333.04 --> 4338.4
everybody

4335.04 --> 4340.48
yeah that would definitely work out

4338.4 --> 4343.759999999999
considering that i have like

4340.48 --> 4346.799999999999
currently 35 watching

4343.76 --> 4346.8
that would definitely help

4352.239 --> 4357.5599999999995
lydia

4353.76 --> 4357.56
ford fiesta yeah

4360.56 --> 4366.4800000000005
right but i am not really into cars that

4362.96 --> 4366.4800000000005
much right now because

4366.88 --> 4373.28
i don't want to start missing it again

4370.88 --> 4375.28
and there's no direct prospect in my

4373.28 --> 4377.84
near future where it's going to be

4375.28 --> 4379.199
available to me again so i just don't

4377.84 --> 4382.08
want to like

4379.199 --> 4385.839999999999
put seeds in the ground when i know i

4382.08 --> 4388.8
can't actually grow it

4385.84 --> 4388.8
if you know what i mean

4391.04 --> 4396.48
so i'm just sticking to my bicycle

4394.8 --> 4399.84
right now

4396.48 --> 4399.839999999999
that's gonna have to do

4404.0 --> 4410.0
love there okay

4406.48 --> 4412.32
i do not know what less that is

4410.0 --> 4413.6
but yeah i had a shower again yesterday

4412.32 --> 4415.12
night and

4413.6 --> 4418.08
my hair is

4415.12 --> 4418.08
super fluffy

4419.28 --> 4423.32
but still pretty cool

4426.719 --> 4429.719
um

4464.64 --> 4468.360000000001
oh god that

4470.96 --> 4475.28
that's

4472.8 --> 4475.28
weird

4476.159 --> 4480.759999999999
i don't think i look like that at all

4483.44 --> 4486.4
deb where

4491.36 --> 4496.32
yeah yeah he is apparently i looked it

4493.76 --> 4498.8
up on google with images and yeah that's

4496.32 --> 4500.5599999999995
definitely like that vampire character

4498.8 --> 4502.320000000001
but

4500.56 --> 4504.96
he kind of looks gay

4502.32 --> 4508.679
that's not what i look like thanks

4504.96 --> 4508.679
and he's like blonde

4514.8 --> 4520.400000000001
have i met nathan or anthony reilly yes

4517.44 --> 4520.4
i have actually

4521.199 --> 4526.96
i've met nathan face to face he's the

4523.12 --> 4529.36
one that handed me ranty's camera

4526.96 --> 4532.36
at the amsterdam conference in

4529.36 --> 4532.36
2019

4535.76 --> 4540.88
you do resemble the actor what are you

4538.32 --> 4540.88
talking about

4544.159 --> 4549.12
sorry debwayer i

4546.56 --> 4552.2390000000005
i don't know that movie

4549.12 --> 4556.0
i'm not all that interested

4552.239 --> 4556.0
in vampire characters

4562.08 --> 4565.6
i mean

4563.36 --> 4568.88
in ways i'm interested like in the

4565.6 --> 4568.88
styles right

4575.6 --> 4579.679
like clothing styles and all that

4578.96 --> 4581.84
but

4579.679 --> 4581.84
yeah

4582.4 --> 4585.12
that's about it

4588.56 --> 4594.0
that movie was a homosexual fantasy i'm

4591.12 --> 4596.719
not surprised

4594.0 --> 4599.28
like there's a lot of like vampires and

4596.719 --> 4601.52
gay [ __ ]

4599.28 --> 4604.08
like even i bumped into that it was very

4601.52 --> 4604.080000000001
annoying

4606.239 --> 4611.48
let's just say i'm not a big fan of gay

4608.48 --> 4611.48
vampires

4626.8 --> 4632.88
for the ferrari

4629.12 --> 4632.88
thank you godzilla that's hilarious

4633.28 --> 4639.36
i told you about irwin what who did you

4636.48 --> 4639.36
who are you talking to

4640.48 --> 4643.5199999999995
tom cruise

4642.8 --> 4647.04
i

4643.52 --> 4647.040000000001
don't look like tom cruise

4647.6 --> 4653.96
i'm much taller than him no i'm not

4650.719 --> 4653.96
just kidding

4676.96 --> 4681.679
didn't get gay by from that i'm not

4679.04 --> 4684.239
saying that any movie specifically is

4681.679 --> 4687.52
gay or anything it's just that my

4684.239 --> 4689.919999999999
average association with vampires

4687.52 --> 4692.400000000001
like in my goth days and it was kind of

4689.92 --> 4695.4400000000005
the theme that i was

4692.4 --> 4698.719
dabbling in i guess

4695.44 --> 4698.719
it was like a lot of gay

4700.32 --> 4705.719
but

4701.199 --> 4705.719
yeah i thought that was really annoying

4706.159 --> 4710.239
i'm not like that at all i just kind of

4708.32 --> 4712.5599999999995
like the style i like the style of like

4710.239 --> 4715.919999999999
a fade like the troubled figure that's

4712.56 --> 4719.679
in the kind of in the shadows

4715.92 --> 4720.4
because the world can't handle him right

4719.679 --> 4722.0
that

4720.4 --> 4724.48
gothic

4722.0 --> 4726.4
setup that's the thing that kind of drew

4724.48 --> 4731.599999999999
me in not

4726.4 --> 4731.599999999999
like oh now we can be gay with the devil

4732.84 --> 4738.32
yeah i hate that

4735.92 --> 4740.0
i really really

4738.32 --> 4745.08
really don't like that

4740.0 --> 4745.08
at all it always looks super gross

4763.6 --> 4770.56
but yeah to be fair like

4766.8 --> 4773.04
in ways like the setup of like a vampire

4770.56 --> 4775.360000000001
male mysterious male or whatever and

4773.04 --> 4777.6
like a woman

4775.36 --> 4780.08
that's like really attracted to that and

4777.6 --> 4783.1990000000005
like a bit scared and like a romantic

4780.08 --> 4784.88
setup like that yeah that

4783.199 --> 4787.12
in the past at least

4784.88 --> 4789.28
did appeal to me i did think that was

4787.12 --> 4792.32
pretty cool

4789.28 --> 4792.32
i was interested

4793.44 --> 4797.199
but

4794.96 --> 4797.199
like

4800.56 --> 4804.84
most of that is just in my past

4809.6 --> 4814.320000000001
i mean i did actually kind of play like

4811.92 --> 4815.36
a vampire bit just to

4814.32 --> 4817.759999999999
well

4815.36 --> 4820.239
pick up on

4817.76 --> 4822.159000000001
that i sized up to kind of be into that

4820.239 --> 4823.678999999999
and usually was correct

4822.159 --> 4825.599999999999
right

4823.679 --> 4828.96
now talking

4825.6 --> 4828.96
like two decades ago

4830.84 --> 4835.679
uh but i don't play around with that

4833.6 --> 4838.8
anymore

4835.679 --> 4840.719
i mean the real me what i am actually

4838.8 --> 4842.8
like what's happening in my head and all

4840.719 --> 4844.8
that

4842.8 --> 4847.52
like the reality is much more

4844.8 --> 4852.4800000000005
interesting than any act i can i could

4847.52 --> 4852.4800000000005
conjure up to kind of play on something

4854.0 --> 4857.44
coats not oats what

4857.679 --> 4861.52
fashion the black trench yeah the black

4859.76 --> 4864.0
trench but that's mine that's the thing

4861.52 --> 4866.4800000000005
right the matrix started that

4864.0 --> 4871.28
the matrix when i first saw it

4866.48 --> 4874.48
is i knew like that that is my style

4871.28 --> 4877.599999999999
and i like matrix because it it's not

4874.48 --> 4877.599999999999
not vampires

4879.28 --> 4883.0
it's not like that

4891.04 --> 4896.719
right i like the style not the the habit

4894.239 --> 4896.718999999999
