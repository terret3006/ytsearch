118.259 --> 123.36
and if you haven't already subscribe to

121.079 --> 125.88

125.88 --> 129.899

127.799 --> 132.239
weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

129.899 --> 135.0
weekend and please also do support me

132.239 --> 136.98000000000002

much appreciated and can always use the

136.98 --> 144.06
support really so please keep it coming

141.0 --> 147.42
right whether today is

144.06 --> 151.2
well first off extremely windy

147.42 --> 152.099
and so bad that I actually have to put

151.2 --> 155.33999999999997
my

152.099 --> 159.54
parsley plant even in between the

155.34 --> 161.76
railing or it would blow away

159.54 --> 164.099
that usually doesn't happen this because

161.76 --> 165.12
there's like real strong gusts of wind

164.099 --> 167.28
and

165.12 --> 170.459
the scenery up there is continually

167.28 --> 172.86
changing now it's super blue

170.459 --> 176.04
super blue

172.86 --> 178.019
but I mean like half an hour ago it was

176.04 --> 180.599
super clouded

178.019 --> 182.70000000000002
big cloud I thought it was going to be

180.599 --> 184.98
clouded like the entire day but

182.7 --> 186.83999999999997
apparently not it's just really big

184.98 --> 189.06
clouds flying over

186.84 --> 190.62
everything up there is rushing by you

189.06 --> 193.8
could probably see that cloud in the

190.62 --> 197.36
distance compared to the tree

193.8 --> 197.36
maybe it's a bit fake

199.56 --> 204.56
how can I do the contrast thing

207.84 --> 211.98
don't know why it works sometimes and

209.94 --> 214.62
sometimes it doesn't

211.98 --> 217.79999999999998
I don't understand how the focusing on

214.62 --> 221.48000000000002
this webcam thing works

217.8 --> 221.48000000000002
anyway it's rushing past

232.799 --> 238.459
right

234.86 --> 238.459
still kind of nice

239.519 --> 244.64000000000001
it is still decently warm

242.34 --> 247.799
but I mean

244.64 --> 249.42
not super warm

247.799 --> 254.299
okay

249.42 --> 254.29899999999998
22 degrees huh all right

262.199 --> 271.32
all right anyway

265.139 --> 271.32
it is Sunday the 16th of July 2023

272.96 --> 277.5
I'm wearing

275.52 --> 280.02
uh

277.5 --> 284.0
steamy traveler shirt

280.02 --> 284.0
my white shirt is in the wash right now

289.68 --> 294.199
hello literally first in chat

294.36 --> 298.1
letter Sage good to see you

300.78 --> 304.4
right so yeah I'm

304.74 --> 309.90000000000003
a Restless mood also because of the wind

307.259 --> 314.18
probably

309.9 --> 314.17999999999995
got really agitated earlier

314.22 --> 319.02000000000004
hope that's not gonna happen on the show

317.82 --> 320.88
um

319.02 --> 323.18
I think I almost blew my voice out

320.88 --> 323.18
actually

325.08 --> 327.919
wow anyway

329.639 --> 333.86
how are you guys doing this Sunday

336.6 --> 342.36
yesterday was really void

339.72 --> 345.5
stream wise

342.36 --> 345.5
it's barely anything

354.12 --> 357.12
uh

357.9 --> 363.06
I watched a Saturday special on Infowars

360.96 --> 366.44
and later I watched the movie on Netflix

363.06 --> 366.44
and that's pretty much it

374.28 --> 381.02
yeah vladder Sage yeah I just showed

376.86 --> 381.02000000000004
that it's very windy it's 22 degrees

386.759 --> 390.5
low borders boy Richard G

393.56 --> 396.86
right

394.74 --> 400.44
[Music]

396.86 --> 402.36
got the Illuminati Castle here I feel

400.44 --> 404.16
like eating it because I am actually

402.36 --> 406.13
kind of hungry

404.16 --> 414.06
got no Rook a lot today

406.13 --> 416.15999999999997
[Music]

414.06 --> 418.319
the movie that you watch yeah it was a

416.16 --> 419.58000000000004
bit depressing it was like this Swedish

418.319 --> 423.44
movie

419.58 --> 423.44
like a Swedish sort of

426.6 --> 430.62
three piece

428.34 --> 433.61999999999995
it's called The Way of the serpent and

430.62 --> 434.94
it was pretty much about Swedish

433.62 --> 438.3
grabblers

434.94 --> 440.699
or a Swedish grabbler and a family that

438.3 --> 443.039
was just getting

440.699 --> 445.139
well pretty rough

443.039 --> 447.479
pretty rough life

445.139 --> 452.24
but I mean it is like this really

447.479 --> 452.24
hardcore realism to to that movie

456.18 --> 461.52
right and I mean like

459.06 --> 465.599
the main antagonist if you could even

461.52 --> 469.38
call it that it was like he was

465.599 --> 470.94
such a Grappler it was like almost well

469.38 --> 472.199
it wasn't like they hadn't didn't have

470.94 --> 474.84
the looks

472.199 --> 477.06
I forgot they had it just looked like a

474.84 --> 478.67999999999995
Swedish guy that turned into a Grappler

477.06 --> 482.58
this is

478.68 --> 485.639
his dad certainly looked like a Grappler

482.58 --> 487.979
but I mean I don't know

485.639 --> 492.08
it's certainly a movie that you don't

487.979 --> 492.08
really see anything like that a lot

502.86 --> 507.44
it it also had like this weird

508.86 --> 513.599
you say that

510.419 --> 515.64
pessimism to it

513.599 --> 517.9190000000001
because

515.64 --> 520.02
like they were like yeah everything is

517.919 --> 521.6999999999999
fine and they just show that in like a

520.02 --> 523.68
two second shot like oh yeah everything

521.7 --> 525.779
is fine and then oh and here comes the

523.68 --> 527.66
[ __ ] things and it's like literally like

525.779 --> 530.279
oh he's at work

527.66 --> 531.779
dang he has an accident like

530.279 --> 534.12
it's like oh it has to work oh what is

531.779 --> 536.64
he doing oh but you don't have time

534.12 --> 539.16
really to get into it because it's just

536.64 --> 542.88
there to show you an accident basically

539.16 --> 544.62
and like the movie is really very bitter

542.88 --> 547.68
in that sense

544.62 --> 550.14
it is it was quite an experience pretty

547.68 --> 554.12
long movie too

550.14 --> 554.12
but I mean it's it's brutal

558.24 --> 565.08
but I mean it's brutal in a very like oh

561.42 --> 568.5
realistic historical way I mean

565.08 --> 571.74
they certainly don't like

568.5 --> 575.22
like flirt it up or like make it Disney

571.74 --> 577.14
fired like make it seem less harsh no no

575.22 --> 579.6600000000001
they're like no

577.14 --> 581.3389999999999
this is the [ __ ] this is the [ __ ]

579.66 --> 586.019
reality

581.339 --> 587.8800000000001
yeah it's like yeah it's brutal it's

586.019 --> 590.7
just brutal

587.88 --> 595.2
I mean let's get down to it it's pretty

590.7 --> 597.899
much about a woman whose husband like

595.2 --> 600.72
completely [ __ ] up got drunk

597.899 --> 604.32
too much in secret and then got major

600.72 --> 606.899
debt dies and then they all inherit the

604.32 --> 608.94
debt and basically the Grapplers they

606.899 --> 610.86
they started like

608.94 --> 612.899
yeah

610.86 --> 614.88
they claim the house and then they ask

612.899 --> 616.68
rent and then they can't pay the rent a

614.88 --> 619.08
lot of the time and then basically the

616.68 --> 622.1999999999999
women have to do prostitution because of

619.08 --> 624.0
that with with that guy

622.2 --> 628.1600000000001
and they're pretty [ __ ] disgusting

624.0 --> 628.16
and it's very brutal guys

628.62 --> 631.4590000000001
ah

631.5 --> 638.66
but

634.14 --> 641.88
it was just very serious and

638.66 --> 644.16
interesting it was so raw it was like

641.88 --> 646.98
super super raw

644.16 --> 649.56
and that did despite it being pretty

646.98 --> 652.62
[ __ ] up and disgusting a lot

649.56 --> 655.38
it made it interesting

652.62 --> 659.22
like it really was a look in

655.38 --> 663.12
in a far away time kind of thing

659.22 --> 667.0790000000001
they put so much effort into like making

663.12 --> 669.0600000000001
it realistic it was pretty incredible

667.079 --> 672.18
and you get a really good perspective

669.06 --> 673.56
from just yeah that woman and that

672.18 --> 675.899
family's life

673.56 --> 678.0
and how they still really make it make

675.899 --> 679.8
effort to make it work despite

678.0 --> 683.06
everything being so [ __ ] up and that

679.8 --> 683.06
is very interesting about it

686.459 --> 691.459
right but it is really pessimistic as

689.339 --> 695.339
[ __ ]

691.459 --> 697.9799999999999
I mean they're not mopey they're not

695.339 --> 701.519
like oh a depressed guy no no it's all

697.98 --> 705.24
kinds of people people come and go

701.519 --> 708.48
die get reborn grow up

705.24 --> 711.54
all all kinds of stuff

708.48 --> 714.4200000000001
but it's just the way it's filmed is

711.54 --> 716.519
really dark in a way like it's you do

714.42 --> 719.04
you just get to see you don't really get

716.519 --> 721.26
to like ah lay back and just enjoy it no

719.04 --> 724.88
no you get to see

721.26 --> 724.88
a lot of [ __ ] up things

728.76 --> 733.2
yeah reality can be pretty dark and Grim

730.8 --> 736.68
it seems like it was realistic and had

733.2 --> 738.3000000000001
this interesting after speech too

736.68 --> 740.579
like

738.3 --> 743.42
because it was apparently based on a

740.579 --> 743.42
historical record

745.2 --> 749.6400000000001
and it it's funny because in the movie

747.12 --> 751.64
they even like notif they they show you

749.64 --> 754.92
how they write things down on paper

751.64 --> 758.279
register things like who's born and

754.92 --> 761.64
who dies and like Father a known with a

758.279 --> 765.48
lot of them that sort of thing

761.64 --> 767.1
and so there is it's probably based on

765.48 --> 768.899
the historical record that they

767.1 --> 770.339
basically show How It Was Written in

768.899 --> 773.1
there too so

770.339 --> 775.5
it's it was interesting it was like a

773.1 --> 777.4200000000001
super reenactment movie in a way like

775.5 --> 780.48
that

777.42 --> 782.88
but I mean it was all pretty dark and

780.48 --> 784.74
Gravelly and

782.88 --> 787.26
but there's certainly no freaking

784.74 --> 790.86
propaganda in that [ __ ] to be found or a

787.26 --> 793.38
propagandizing message in any way

790.86 --> 798.54
in any way and that was a delight it's

793.38 --> 803.399
like oh zero percent politicism zero it

798.54 --> 805.86
was just old-fashioned dark Swedish

803.399 --> 810.24
uh right

805.86 --> 812.76
so despite it making me like Ugh

810.24 --> 814.38
haven't I have that sometimes guys when

812.76 --> 816.779
something is just [ __ ] up I just go

814.38 --> 817.8
sit with my hand in front of my eyes it

816.779 --> 819.48
just like

817.8 --> 822.24
I just want to see a little piece of

819.48 --> 825.0600000000001
this is just so [ __ ] but

822.24 --> 826.8
despite all that afterward it was like

825.06 --> 828.8389999999999
wow

826.8 --> 831.56
that was very interesting to have

828.839 --> 831.5600000000001
watched all that

834.24 --> 838.88
and it also made me think like dude

838.92 --> 845.16
why am I complaining

841.74 --> 847.86
that my life is poor and [ __ ] when you

845.16 --> 851.1
look at that dude I mean

847.86 --> 853.26
it it does like clean up some of the

851.1 --> 856.2
perspective

853.26 --> 858.36
of like what we're living through now

856.2 --> 861.36
which really is much more distraction

858.36 --> 862.8000000000001
based pollution than it is just a

861.36 --> 865.76
Baseline

862.8 --> 865.76
poverty

868.68 --> 874.079
because I can do much more live much

871.32 --> 875.94
better be much more secure than any of

874.079 --> 880.1389999999999
those people in that movie

875.94 --> 882.0600000000001
like by far and that really does that in

880.139 --> 885.0600000000001
that sense it it was actually kind of

882.06 --> 887.579
like relieving

885.06 --> 890.459
so yeah interesting movie

887.579 --> 892.199
I bet a lot of you would appreciate it

890.459 --> 895.579
for its

892.199 --> 895.579
rigidity and

896.579 --> 899.93
and how non-politicized it is

899.399 --> 903.12
anyway

899.93 --> 905.6389999999999
[Music]

903.12 --> 907.98
and the actors were all very Swedish

905.639 --> 911.339
looking too

907.98 --> 914.1
so they were probably all sweets but

911.339 --> 916.639
they were very Swedish looking too

914.1 --> 916.639
anyway

921.48 --> 924.779
hello

923.04 --> 927.3199999999999
25 years

924.779 --> 927.32
what

939.24 --> 944.6
yeah

942.0 --> 944.6
what

948.72 --> 952.279
wait it's been removed

953.399 --> 956.399
what

959.639 --> 964.139
so it's been but does it still exist out

962.639 --> 968.42
there I mean

964.139 --> 968.42
do people have it on DVDs or something

968.579 --> 973.3199999999999
or did they remove the movie like really

970.98 --> 976.76
quick after it came out and it never

973.32 --> 976.7600000000001
came on DVD or something

983.639 --> 991.199
someone okay interesting

987.66 --> 994.8199999999999
I don't know I might have seen it

991.199 --> 994.8199999999999
maybe maybe not

995.579 --> 999.959
I don't know if it's really graphic I

997.68 --> 1003.079
then I probably didn't see it I would

999.959 --> 1005.6199999999999
remember it better then if I had

1003.079 --> 1005.62
anyway

1012.079 --> 1018.38
hey Richard yeah

1014.62 --> 1020.24
disappearing it oh it's just censorship

1018.38 --> 1022.9399999999999
I mean that does happen

1020.24 --> 1025.04
and back then they did do censorship for

1022.94 --> 1028.819
reasons that most people thought were

1025.04 --> 1031.22
okay it's like oh this is too graphic to

1028.819 --> 1034.8799999999999
sexual or

1031.22 --> 1037.76
like both too criminal I mean to be fair

1034.88 --> 1039.38
I actually from a Public's perspective I

1037.76 --> 1042.26
think it's actually reasonable but

1039.38 --> 1044.9
owning from a Public's perspective right

1042.26 --> 1046.52
the Sheep like two sensor movies like

1044.9 --> 1049.52
that

1046.52 --> 1051.62
because it it just creates a lot of

1049.52 --> 1054.58
restlessness and anguish

1051.62 --> 1054.58
in sheeple

1057.679 --> 1063.02
I mean now if it happens in this time

1061.22 --> 1067.24
period it's a whole different matter

1063.02 --> 1069.559
because well a lot of it has been really

1067.24 --> 1072.08
exposed in ways

1069.559 --> 1075.44
and more upfront in the attention so the

1072.08 --> 1077.8999999999999
entire world setting is different now

1075.44 --> 1079.52
compared to 30 years ago

1077.9 --> 1081.679
it's just different

1079.52 --> 1083.72
people don't think the same way there's

1081.679 --> 1085.96
a different balance like it doesn't work

1083.72 --> 1085.96
anymore

1086.9 --> 1091.0
things have kind of already gone out of

1088.82 --> 1091.0
control

1091.039 --> 1096.14
in ways

1092.6 --> 1100.2199999999998
that well back then they try to

1096.14 --> 1102.26
basically protect the public from that

1100.22 --> 1103.94
while the Liberals were trying to be

1102.26 --> 1106.34
naughty and getting through like a

1103.94 --> 1108.74
secretly showing some things that are

1106.34 --> 1111.6789999999999
taboo right and that was still kind of

1108.74 --> 1114.16
cute back then now it's like they've

1111.679 --> 1117.919
just taken it all the way it's been

1114.16 --> 1121.52
normalized against the Public's will

1117.919 --> 1124.9
and people are going freaking insane

1121.52 --> 1124.9
and so yeah

1125.059 --> 1129.86
it's like the censorship would be

1127.1 --> 1132.1399999999999
endless now if they would try to roll it

1129.86 --> 1134.539
all back I mean just imagine like how

1132.14 --> 1136.46
many series and movies would just be

1134.539 --> 1140.86
canceled

1136.46 --> 1140.8600000000001
because they they're taking it too far

1143.36 --> 1148.4189999999999
let alone the woke [ __ ]

1145.94 --> 1148.419
anyway

1161.36 --> 1164.26
oh

1165.08 --> 1172.039
okay each other

1168.5 --> 1174.32
all right that's weird are you sure you

1172.039 --> 1177.8799999999999
actually saw it on television and not in

1174.32 --> 1177.8799999999999
an in a vision or something

1179.9 --> 1186.38
I mean I had a really weird experiences

1183.799 --> 1188.9
that were like even hard to trace that

1186.38 --> 1190.5800000000002
it was happening for me where I would

1188.9 --> 1194.48
basically like get together with the

1190.58 --> 1197.539
family watch something on television

1194.48 --> 1202.66
that was really intense and extreme and

1197.539 --> 1202.66
and then like nobody remembers that

1203.78 --> 1208.76
and I'm like what the [ __ ]

1206.059 --> 1210.6789999999999
I but we watched it together

1208.76 --> 1212.84
I remember responses and everything and

1210.679 --> 1214.76
they don't recall and it's like did I

1212.84 --> 1217.52
watch that in a dream in a dark World

1214.76 --> 1219.44
Vision or something

1217.52 --> 1223.9
I don't know maybe I'm not the only one

1219.44 --> 1223.9
that happens to it's it's so weird

1236.419 --> 1239.2
do that

1246.38 --> 1252.5
wait I do remember I do remember I think

1249.86 --> 1255.02
an American movie

1252.5 --> 1257.179
that was like that

1255.02 --> 1259.76
I'm getting some weird Associated

1257.179 --> 1261.919
imagery with what you just rolled out

1259.76 --> 1264.98
there

1261.919 --> 1268.46
I think I might vaguely through

1264.98 --> 1270.2
having seen fragments of it

1268.46 --> 1272.5
know what you're talking about it's

1270.2 --> 1272.5
weird

1277.88 --> 1281.5590000000002
do you remember the name of it

1283.28 --> 1286.539
oh Joiner

1314.539 --> 1317.62
hey Mark collard

1320.72 --> 1324.4

jedo I don't think I remember it

1375.42 --> 1378.749
[Music]

1389.78 --> 1394.34
so well Marco I think Jordan is probably

1392.419 --> 1398.0590000000002
a gamma

1394.34 --> 1402.34
and you made a joke and he

1398.059 --> 1402.34
had a gamma remark to that

1406.76 --> 1415.039
he thinks he's funny

1409.67 --> 1417.3200000000002
[Music]

1415.039 --> 1418.33
all right anyway I'm digging into this

1417.32 --> 1419.6589999999999
Illuminati Castle

1418.33 --> 1421.72
[Music]

1419.659 --> 1421.72
um

1422.12 --> 1425.8999999999999
just

1423.04 --> 1428.3799999999999
[Music]

1425.9 --> 1428.38
okay

1459.22 --> 1465.32
enough now jedo yeah I don't want to

1462.86 --> 1469.4189999999999
hear more about [ __ ] up

1465.32 --> 1469.4189999999999
child trafficking movies thanks

1469.64 --> 1478.76
could it be okay if we just

1472.88 --> 1482.96
don't directly fall into the overt

1478.76 --> 1484.94
devil sliding slope trap would be great

1482.96 --> 1487.52
if we don't all just end up talking

1484.94 --> 1489.799
about it continually like every [ __ ]

1487.52 --> 1492.2
alternative media now thinking that

1489.799 --> 1496.36
they're winning

1492.2 --> 1496.3600000000001
by bringing this [ __ ] up continually

1502.7 --> 1508.3600000000001
all right

1504.98 --> 1508.3600000000001
that's fine jedo

1510.799 --> 1516.86
I'm just saying I'm not going to talk

1513.74 --> 1518.48
about that subject

1516.86 --> 1520.52
like that

1518.48 --> 1523.84
I'm definitely not gonna have a normal

1520.52 --> 1523.84
conversation about it

1525.38 --> 1530.3200000000002
I'd like to focus attention on more

1527.539 --> 1530.32
productive things

1536.419 --> 1540.8200000000002
because you guys watching you're not

1539.12 --> 1544.3999999999999
gonna be able to do anything

1540.82 --> 1545.8999999999999
constructive with it except obsess over

1544.4 --> 1549.3200000000002
it and

1545.9 --> 1553.539
get filled with anguish and feelings of

1549.32 --> 1553.539
powerlessness and I don't want that

1559.94 --> 1564.98
and I want I want you to get used to it

1563.179 --> 1566.539
either so that you numb down and that

1564.98 --> 1570.02
you just talk about it like it's normal

1566.539 --> 1573.35
right like the Psychopaths do

1570.02 --> 1576.54
don't just just don't

1573.35 --> 1576.54
[Music]

1589.179 --> 1596.179
right by even accidentally normalizing

1593.9 --> 1599.8400000000001
this stuff

1596.179 --> 1603.919
you literally give the elite doing all

1599.84 --> 1606.799
this that Industrial Level trafficking

1603.919 --> 1609.679
you're giving them a ticket out that you

1606.799 --> 1611.0
were giving them an escape by forcing

1609.679 --> 1614.1200000000001
yourself

1611.0 --> 1617.24
to normalize it

1614.12 --> 1619.76
because you think that'll help you

1617.24 --> 1624.799
to become able to tackle it and it's not

1619.76 --> 1627.64
you want it won't help you tackle it

1624.799 --> 1627.6399999999999
knowing it

1629.48 --> 1634.6
trust me

1631.1 --> 1634.6
because I tried that

1638.72 --> 1643.539
I didn't believe it was real and then I

1641.0 --> 1643.539
faced it

1643.82 --> 1646.299
foreign

1649.94 --> 1655.159
right and I even wanted to go to like

1653.059 --> 1657.74
the police or anything to make it to

1655.159 --> 1661.4
make that situation stop that I found

1657.74 --> 1664.22
out about but it didn't work I realized

1661.4 --> 1668.8600000000001
that the entire judicial system like it

1664.22 --> 1668.8600000000001
it doesn't actually work against it

1670.82 --> 1678.08
because the people involved

1673.88 --> 1680.3600000000001
like it just doesn't work

1678.08 --> 1682.1589999999999
all the police forces most of them they

1680.36 --> 1683.539
just crumble in the face of it they

1682.159 --> 1685.46
don't respond they don't take you

1683.539 --> 1687.2
serious but not even because they really

1685.46 --> 1689.98
don't believe you but because they just

1687.2 --> 1689.98
can't handle it

1690.26 --> 1696.74
and like how it even freaking works is

1694.76 --> 1700.64
insane

1696.74 --> 1703.7
like the child literally has to

1700.64 --> 1706.7
report it well guess what happens with

1703.7 --> 1708.919
with most of them like they absolutely

1706.7 --> 1710.6000000000001
never reported and they're in full

1708.919 --> 1715.24
Stockholm

1710.6 --> 1715.24
so it just doesn't even work it's crazy

1715.82 --> 1718.82
foreign

1726.44 --> 1732.4
you can only like have a military

1728.48 --> 1732.4
solution to it effectively

1737.84 --> 1741.039
and it's not happening

1752.84 --> 1757.22
what the [ __ ] yeah more color is fine

1755.6 --> 1759.76
the guy I don't know what the [ __ ] he's

1757.22 --> 1759.76
whining about

yeah anyway

[Music]

1815.09 --> 1818.72
[Music]

1853.52 --> 1859.72
because akimbo now that name doesn't

1857.12 --> 1859.7199999999998
ring a bell

1863.48 --> 1866.02
foreign

1873.18 --> 1876.38
[Music]

1909.28 --> 1912.599
[Music]

1944.12 --> 1949.2199999999998
oh right yeah Mark yeah you did share

1946.7 --> 1951.98
that about your past yesterday

1949.22 --> 1953.419
yeah trolls don't like that at all they

1951.98 --> 1955.52
don't

1953.419 --> 1957.5
they don't like it when people reveal

1955.52 --> 1960.8799999999999
their weaknesses and then still are

1957.5 --> 1960.88
accepted and remain strong

1961.1 --> 1965.9599999999998
because they probably hung around

1963.2 --> 1968.8600000000001
bullies a lot and they just saw that as

1965.96 --> 1968.8600000000001
weakness and now

1968.899 --> 1972.039
they're just stuck

1975.38 --> 1979.88
unable to deal with their own weaknesses

1977.659 --> 1983.38
like to face it

1979.88 --> 1983.38
and to be honest about it

1985.52 --> 1990.2
and so they yeah

1988.399 --> 1992.86
they then bully you they think that

1990.2 --> 1992.8600000000001
that's weak

1993.86 --> 1997.1
right

1994.88 --> 1998.8400000000001
let's see it like this like they think

1997.1 --> 2002.32
that that's gay

1998.84 --> 2005.62
confessing a weakness you have

2002.32 --> 2008.4399999999998
like that from your past

2005.62 --> 2009.2199999999998
so that's why they then start nagging

2008.44 --> 2012.64
you

2009.22 --> 2016.44
and they've done that with me so

2012.64 --> 2016.44
plenty to nag about with me

2016.899 --> 2019.3799999999999
all right

2022.1 --> 2025.29
[Music]

2040.6 --> 2045.58
yeah smart colored right and that's the

2042.82 --> 2048.659
part that they don't get

2045.58 --> 2048.659
they don't believe it

2051.76 --> 2057.7200000000003
they don't believe you you'll be

2053.98 --> 2057.72
stronger after you confessed it

2059.56 --> 2062.82
they deny that part

2067.26 --> 2071.98
you never come back if you well I would

2070.179 --> 2074.7400000000002
I certainly hope you wouldn't have left

2071.98 --> 2076.599
I mean you could feel like afterwards

2074.74 --> 2079.5
like a [ __ ] maybe it was a bit too far

2076.599 --> 2079.5
or something but

2081.159 --> 2086.619
means nothing to leave over there's been

2083.56 --> 2088.06
other people confessing their past drug

2086.619 --> 2091.5
problems here

2088.06 --> 2091.5
plenty of people actually

2093.04 --> 2096.119
of all sorts

2104.7 --> 2108.24
Roxy what the [ __ ]

2109.9 --> 2113.1600000000003
what the hell are you talking about

2117.18 --> 2121.2
yeah I know Mark Albert

2124.06 --> 2128.04
right because then you didn't don't deal

2125.68 --> 2128.04
with it

2153.88 --> 2156.599
oh

2156.7 --> 2163.3199999999997
it's you it's a journey

2160.18 --> 2163.3199999999997
okay fine

2165.7 --> 2168.7799999999997
it's Cleary

2169.96 --> 2174.359
and you are a troll that's right

2175.9 --> 2180.7000000000003
you are

2177.94 --> 2182.619
and you have been I remember you from

2180.7 --> 2185.4399999999996
the beginning as a guy that just

2182.619 --> 2188.38
continually trolls

2185.44 --> 2191.44
this very rare exceptional moment where

2188.38 --> 2194.32
you're actually focused

2191.44 --> 2198.7000000000003
and acting like a decent human being but

2194.32 --> 2201.3
overall you are a troll an Escapist

2198.7 --> 2201.2999999999997
troll

2204.339 --> 2209.4
you don't seem to have any sense of

2206.38 --> 2209.4
loyalty anywhere

2212.5 --> 2217.54
and then yesterday you had the brilliant

2215.44 --> 2219.2200000000003
idea to confess to my face that you're

2217.54 --> 2221.079
actually gay

2219.22 --> 2223.3799999999997
which is one of the dumbest thing you

2221.079 --> 2223.38
could do

2227.7 --> 2232.859
you're lucky I don't just straight out

2230.26 --> 2232.8590000000004
ban you

the majority

2266.02 --> 2270.839
of flat earthers that I know that I've

2268.599 --> 2270.839
seen

2271.66 --> 2275.64
are idiots and dicks

2287.619 --> 2293.6800000000003
I'm very happy to have collected

2290.859 --> 2297.0
the good ones overall

2293.68 --> 2297.0
and you're not one of them

2310.56 --> 2319.56

I became homophobic okay

but it's it's this [ __ ]

2394.599 --> 2398.92
yeah

2395.88 --> 2401.38
lying sneaking

2398.92 --> 2404.579
double speaking

2401.38 --> 2404.579
I [ __ ] hate it

2410.619 --> 2415.6600000000003

but also pretending like you're not yeah

2415.66 --> 2419.16
go [ __ ] yourself yeah

2424.42 --> 2427.579
[Music]

2431.13 --> 2442.139
[Music]

2448.54 --> 2451.44
all right

2463.599 --> 2468.339
yeah AGM I mean doesn't work that way

2466.839 --> 2471.82
unfortunately because a lot of those

2468.339 --> 2474.22
people trolling me are not all

2471.82 --> 2476.02
12 year olds

2474.22 --> 2480.2799999999997
it's mostly

2476.02 --> 2482.859
older people like 40 plus

2480.28 --> 2485.1400000000003
some of them even Boomers that just they

2482.859 --> 2487.359
never changed

2485.14 --> 2489.4
and they're Never Gonna Change

2487.359 --> 2493.5
so they don't grow up

2489.4 --> 2493.5
they grow old but they don't grow up

2498.88 --> 2505.38
it's key worse than the globe

2502.0 --> 2505.38
yeah it is to me

2506.92 --> 2513.1800000000003
I don't have Globe allergies

2509.38 --> 2513.1800000000003
I do have gay allergies

2516.64 --> 2522.46
I mean I [ __ ] hate it when globers

2519.099 --> 2527.46
like do their thing and endlessly make

2522.46 --> 2527.46
scattergun [ __ ] I hate that part

2528.7 --> 2536.04
but I still have a

2531.339 --> 2536.04
measure of understanding for it

2537.64 --> 2543.9
I can still empathize to a degree that

2541.18 --> 2543.8999999999996
that's the difference

2549.83 --> 2553.0299999999997
[Music]

2564.94 --> 2570.82
[Music]

2567.94 --> 2573.339
my color he's always like that he always

2570.82 --> 2575.7400000000002
just makes jokes of everything he [ __ ]

2573.339 --> 2577.96
up and then he can't take responsibility

2575.74 --> 2580.72
he can't be serious he can't allow that

2577.96 --> 2582.76
feeling to sink to sink into the real

2580.72 --> 2585.0989999999997
place yeah

2582.76 --> 2587.2000000000003
that's the problem

2585.099 --> 2590.319
problem with a lot of gays is they can

2587.2 --> 2591.8999999999996
just never [ __ ] be honest

2590.319 --> 2595.7799999999997
and it sucks

2591.9 --> 2598.98
they suck you suck and you're [ __ ]

2595.78 --> 2598.98
band go [ __ ] yourself

2608.74 --> 2611.74
foreign

2621.46 --> 2627.96
well in a more generalized slang version

2624.88 --> 2627.96
of gay yes

2628.359 --> 2631.319
but in this case

2631.9 --> 2637.48
it was really about homosexuality in

2634.66 --> 2640.1189999999997
that case like I'm out

2637.48 --> 2641.7400000000002
or rather he's uh I don't want to deal

2640.119 --> 2643.9
with that if anybody else here is

2641.74 --> 2646.859
secretly gay well you better [ __ ]

2643.9 --> 2650.079
keep it a secret forever

2646.859 --> 2652.06
because if I find out

2650.079 --> 2655.6800000000003
you lose your Ranch

2652.06 --> 2655.68
and you're never getting it back

2675.16 --> 2679.8999999999996
yeah and there's other guys that have

2676.96 --> 2681.339
been kind of honestly out there

2679.9 --> 2684.839
and

2681.339 --> 2684.839
I'm not mean to them

2685.96 --> 2690.339
because they were honest from the start

2688.359 --> 2692.14
they just can't help it if find it

2690.339 --> 2693.94
[ __ ] gross I'll give them timeouts

2692.14 --> 2695.5
I'll yell at them I'll slap at them and

2693.94 --> 2698.26
they think it's funny

2695.5 --> 2700.3
I don't hate them necessarily

2698.26 --> 2701.8
just like these guys out there and

2700.3 --> 2704.38
they've been like around for a long time

2701.8 --> 2706.599
and they like me or whatever but at

2704.38 --> 2709.7200000000003
least they know they understand I'm

2706.599 --> 2712.54
homophobic and they don't try to get to

2709.72 --> 2715.02
me because I [ __ ] hate that I hate

2712.54 --> 2715.02
that

2720.819 --> 2726.4
and if you're just gonna shove it in my

2723.28 --> 2729.2200000000003
face like that like no you must accept

2726.4 --> 2732.48
that I'm that what were you ever bigot

2729.22 --> 2732.48
go [ __ ] yourself yeah

2732.7 --> 2737.859
I'm not having your deranged influence

2735.339 --> 2741.0
like that

2737.859 --> 2741.0
I'm not taking it

2742.48 --> 2748.44
if you got that problem then you keep it

2745.359 --> 2748.44
a secret from me

2748.599 --> 2753.339
and then we'll deal with your slightly

2750.64 --> 2754.92
awkward behavior and it's all fine as

2753.339 --> 2757.24
long as you don't

2754.92 --> 2759.28
[ __ ] tell me

2757.24 --> 2761.68
why

2759.28 --> 2765.88
if you really think it's tied in with

2761.68 --> 2768.3999999999996
that thing that Mark Mark of the Beast

2765.88 --> 2771.94
you give yourself by choosing like

2768.4 --> 2774.819
choosing being convinced like oh you're

2771.94 --> 2776.98
gay oh yeah oh you you are like yeah no

2774.819 --> 2779.52
no no that's literally a demon in your

2776.98 --> 2779.52
[ __ ] head

2779.68 --> 2785.0789999999997
that tells you it's okay to have

2781.66 --> 2788.5789999999997
deranged behavior and a deranged mindset

2785.079 --> 2788.579
and that lying is okay

2788.859 --> 2793.14
because you're a victim somehow yeah

2793.24 --> 2796.56
it's not acceptable

2797.68 --> 2803.2
not to me

2800.56 --> 2805.66
and I find it very disturbing that the

2803.2 --> 2808.5989999999997
world has normalized this in the west I

2805.66 --> 2812.14
really find it very disturbing and I

2808.599 --> 2815.1400000000003
have for like 20 years straight

2812.14 --> 2817.839
and it does not make me happy it has

2815.14 --> 2822.9
been a burden and I find I've been very

2817.839 --> 2822.9
agitated with myself that it burdens me

2825.7 --> 2833.56
it's like I wish I wasn't homophobic but

2829.0 --> 2836.74
I cannot afford to let my guard down

2833.56 --> 2839.619
and get caught up with that disgusting

2836.74 --> 2842.6189999999997
[ __ ] again because they come to me yeah

2839.619 --> 2845.2000000000003
as soon as I stop doing this they come

2842.619 --> 2848.92
to me they try to get in my [ __ ]

2845.2 --> 2851.46
pants yeah and there will be violence

2848.92 --> 2851.46
then

2852.28 --> 2858.94
I can't have it I cannot have it I have

2855.94 --> 2861.579
to announce I'm homophobic or they will

2858.94 --> 2864.66
literally try to get to me

2861.579 --> 2864.6600000000003
you get that

2874.89 --> 2878.179
[Music]

2882.099 --> 2888.88
and then even when I say it yeah then

2884.68 --> 2891.3999999999996
you get really annoyed agitated gay

2888.88 --> 2893.6800000000003
trolls or whatever that try to poke me

2891.4 --> 2896.38
with it oh they already oh look at that

2893.68 --> 2899.04
oh so funny yeah well that is a thousand

2896.38 --> 2899.04
times better

2899.26 --> 2904.6600000000003
than unwittingly getting surrounded by

2902.079 --> 2907.48
gays that are trying to like

2904.66 --> 2910.18
work you into some kind of a trap

2907.48 --> 2913.599
okay I'd rather have those [ __ ] up

2910.18 --> 2915.819
trolls telling me how gay I am and get

2913.599 --> 2918.76
pissed off over that I'd rather have

2915.819 --> 2921.16
that than to actually get caught up with

2918.76 --> 2924.96
those types of people

2921.16 --> 2924.96
that literally try to rape you

2942.88 --> 2947.079
and sometimes I wish I was like an ugly

2945.22 --> 2949.72
piece of [ __ ]

2947.079 --> 2951.6400000000003
that it was ugly looking because then at

2949.72 --> 2954.2999999999997
least a [ __ ] gays wouldn't come after

2951.64 --> 2954.2999999999997
me all the time

2958.599 --> 2963.04
I wish to me are still more women

2961.0 --> 2964.54
actually gonna have to be I don't know

2963.04 --> 2966.7
why the [ __ ]

2964.54 --> 2968.8
you know these days it's I mean out

2966.7 --> 2971.2599999999998
there now it's not that bad I'm kind of

2968.8 --> 2973.119
dropped away from the gothic stuff that

2971.26 --> 2975.6400000000003
really did not help in retrospect even

2973.119 --> 2978.46
though I really like the style in ways

2975.64 --> 2980.5
you can do the style right you can do it

2978.46 --> 2982.839
very cool and interesting

2980.5 --> 2986.28
and like intellectually stimulating it

2982.839 --> 2986.2799999999997
doesn't have to be gay

2989.68 --> 2993.339
and nowadays they don't come after me I

2991.9 --> 2995.859
mean

2993.339 --> 2999.2799999999997
I don't look anymore yeah I'm starting

2995.859 --> 3003.119
I'm looking much more like

2999.28 --> 3006.42
right wing oriented I guess although

3003.119 --> 3010.44
they're still the typical liberal traits

3006.42 --> 3013.76
wearing black a lot having the long hair

3010.44 --> 3013.76
a leather jacket

3016.44 --> 3024.14
I'm kind of really resenting my image in

3019.2 --> 3024.14
that sense the problem is I like it yeah

3024.48 --> 3029.88
and now that's a real problem like I

3027.119 --> 3033.56
like the style

3029.88 --> 3037.1400000000003
I chose that style because

3033.56 --> 3039.72
I like this style

3037.14 --> 3041.0989999999997
not because whatever the [ __ ] the world

3039.72 --> 3043.02
thinks about it

3041.099 --> 3046.02
you see

3043.02 --> 3048.359
the goddamn side effect has been that a

3046.02 --> 3051.98
lot of gays get after me and I'm [ __ ]

3048.359 --> 3051.98
pissed off to no end

3062.21 --> 3065.349
[Music]

3066.0 --> 3072.48
as much as I goddamn like

3069.48 --> 3076.64
and tricked is empty too so I can curse

3072.48 --> 3076.64
all the [ __ ] out I want

3077.78 --> 3082.4
not that that has anything to do with it

3080.04 --> 3082.4
I just

3084.72 --> 3088.14
sometimes

3086.04 --> 3090.48
I've been thinking of going back to the

3088.14 --> 3093.1189999999997
church like despite them all being

3090.48 --> 3094.68
[ __ ] up retards

3093.119 --> 3096.9
although they're not that [ __ ] up

3094.68 --> 3099.8999999999996
they're retards not really that [ __ ]

3096.9 --> 3102.7200000000003
up just dumb and uninformed and

3099.9 --> 3105.6600000000003
still very Bliss overall

3102.72 --> 3107.22
or at least that's what I remember it

3105.66 --> 3109.6189999999997
was like

3107.22 --> 3112.7999999999997
three four years ago maybe that's

3109.619 --> 3115.2000000000003
changed I should check back in

3112.8 --> 3117.78
I actually wanted to do that today but I

3115.2 --> 3120.2
forgot and I'm partially pissed off over

3117.78 --> 3120.2000000000003
that too

3120.839 --> 3123.319
oh well

3123.619 --> 3127.46
there's always more time

3160.14 --> 3166.319
maybe it has social problems think I

3163.2 --> 3168.839
don't care or call it he told me

3166.319 --> 3170.4
in the chat I'm gay and now he started

3168.839 --> 3172.74
to crawl back

3170.4 --> 3175.079
which tells me even more that he

3172.74 --> 3176.16
actually is gay because I've seen that

3175.079 --> 3178.1400000000003
happen

3176.16 --> 3180.2999999999997
yeah do you think that's the first gay

3178.14 --> 3182.64
guy that tells me that he's gay and then

3180.3 --> 3184.619
he finds out I'm homophobic

3182.64 --> 3185.94
and then he tries to pretend like that

3184.619 --> 3188.76
never happened

3185.94 --> 3191.7200000000003
yeah it's not the first [ __ ] time I

3188.76 --> 3191.7200000000003
experienced that yeah

3197.64 --> 3199.8799999999997
foreign

3201.38 --> 3204.4390000000003
[Music]

3208.16 --> 3212.24
puke but it's kind of funny

3214.92 --> 3219.0
you almost turned into a punk you just

3216.839 --> 3223.5
suddenly got a mohawk and spiked like

3219.0 --> 3226.22
yeah no I know what you mean

3223.5 --> 3226.22
yeah yeah yeah

3226.75 --> 3230.26
[Music]

3250.559 --> 3254.76
that would be funny

3252.54 --> 3255.7799999999997
yeah but it sucks for that it really

3254.76 --> 3258.3590000000004
sucks

3255.78 --> 3261.599
I mean I feel for you man

3258.359 --> 3264.5989999999997
and you know for me it's extra egregious

3261.599 --> 3264.599
because

3265.319 --> 3271.5
I like hugging

3267.78 --> 3274.26
and I'm very okay with hugging men

3271.5 --> 3277.319
and that's kind of like what I have in

3274.26 --> 3280.0200000000004
me I we identified it in a family as I'm

3277.319 --> 3282.42
like I'm very Mediterranean like that

3280.02 --> 3284.819
they even like kiss on the cheeks that

3282.42 --> 3288.1800000000003
that's like I could do that but it's not

3284.819 --> 3293.48
my style I'm not like Italian like that

3288.18 --> 3293.48
but I really like hugging like heartfelt

3293.64 --> 3298.859
I have a lot of Brotherly Love like that

3296.46 --> 3301.859
and it

3298.859 --> 3304.7999999999997
I missed mistook that when I was younger

3301.859 --> 3306.7799999999997
like around my teens people genuinely

3304.8 --> 3308.76
thought I was gay because of that but it

3306.78 --> 3310.98
was never sexual

3308.76 --> 3313.079
a hug is good I know

3310.98 --> 3315.2400000000002
and for me it's like it gets even

3313.079 --> 3318.3
emotional and [ __ ] and in that part it's

3315.24 --> 3320.819
like I have emotions that's very unusual

3318.3 --> 3324.0
for a man to

3320.819 --> 3327.0
be relatively easy in expressing that in

3324.0 --> 3329.16
having cares and [ __ ] like I'm kind of

3327.0 --> 3331.5
easy with that and that makes me feel

3329.16 --> 3333.72
like a woman sometimes it's like

3331.5 --> 3335.76
this is for real guys you could joke

3333.72 --> 3338.5789999999997
about it all you like whatever but I've

3335.76 --> 3341.2200000000003
had like with my ex watching a movie

3338.579 --> 3343.319
and then something dramatic happened and

3341.22 --> 3348.14
then I get tears and then my ex is

3343.319 --> 3348.14
looking at me like what it's like yeah

3350.339 --> 3354.72
yeah I am like that and I'm not [ __ ]

3353.22 --> 3358.0789999999997
gay

3354.72 --> 3360.7799999999997
I don't have that response in with gay

3358.079 --> 3364.7400000000002
scenes yeah no

3360.78 --> 3367.559
I do not have I did I have it with

3364.74 --> 3368.64
actual men that are trying to that are

3367.559 --> 3370.6800000000003
men

3368.64 --> 3373.5
that have trouble in life and all that

3370.68 --> 3376.8799999999997
and like have trouble finding them that

3373.5 --> 3376.88
all really gets to me

3377.9 --> 3383.76
because of empathy because I feel a lot

3381.119 --> 3386.099
of that so like the struggle of a man

3383.76 --> 3389.2200000000003
especially young man and

3386.099 --> 3393.48
getting work and and with their finding

3389.22 --> 3396.359
a wife like I really empathize with that

3393.48 --> 3397.2
and I sometimes even get emotional over

3396.359 --> 3399.72
that

3397.2 --> 3402.839
but thinking about it like almost it

3399.72 --> 3405.839
gives me but I'm no not gonna happen but

3402.839 --> 3409.16
that's real that's part of me and it's

3405.839 --> 3409.16
not gay

3411.0 --> 3415.5
yeah and I can switch from being

3413.16 --> 3419.819
emotional to being really [ __ ]

3415.5 --> 3423.3
demonic if people take it as such if

3419.819 --> 3425.579
people think that that's me showing my

3423.3 --> 3427.8590000000004
gay side and they're like oh and they

3425.579 --> 3430.619
try to kill dude I've literally smacked

3427.859 --> 3433.64
guys like really bad

3430.619 --> 3433.6400000000003
because they did that

3434.4 --> 3440.46
and I'm I hate it

3437.819 --> 3445.2799999999997
I hate this [ __ ] world with these

3440.46 --> 3445.28
[ __ ] [ __ ] everywhere I hate it

3447.72 --> 3454.3999999999996
I can't be myself with these [ __ ]

3451.2 --> 3454.3999999999996
[ __ ] everywhere

3456.119 --> 3458.6600000000003
[ __ ]

3476.7 --> 3480.359
although with most women it works just

3479.46 --> 3482.52
great

3480.359 --> 3483.54
they like it that I have a vulnerable

3482.52 --> 3486.18
side

3483.54 --> 3490.14
a lot of them they feel like I could

3486.18 --> 3493.94
really understand them and I can

3490.14 --> 3493.94
I really love women

3500.4 --> 3506.28
and it's Troublesome for me because like

3503.88 --> 3508.5
once I open my heart to that kind of

3506.28 --> 3511.1400000000003
love with a woman then it's like I feel

3508.5 --> 3513.599
responsible and then

3511.14 --> 3515.7
it can really wreck my life so I'm not

3513.599 --> 3518.28
very eager to just let anybody in

3515.7 --> 3520.859
anymore like that

3518.28 --> 3523.98
but per default I mean

3520.859 --> 3526.5589999999997
there's a lot of women of all different

3523.98 --> 3529.02
sorts and looks and like different

3526.559 --> 3531.3590000000004
levels of beauty that I like

3529.02 --> 3534.18
and it just get really impressed by and

3531.359 --> 3537.0589999999997
I'm like like you are you have such

3534.18 --> 3539.7599999999998
beauty here and there and

3537.059 --> 3541.26
like I want to make you feel happy and

3539.76 --> 3544.2200000000003
good about yourself

3541.26 --> 3544.2200000000003
I have that

3544.559 --> 3548.7200000000003
I want women to feel good about

3546.24 --> 3548.72
themselves

3553.26 --> 3558.42
but not like in a

3555.599 --> 3560.46
in a forced Wayne like I don't like

3558.42 --> 3563.2200000000003
feminism like that

3560.46 --> 3566.099
that's very incommunicated

3563.22 --> 3567.5989999999997
they don't really communicate when they

3566.099 --> 3569.63
do that when the internet's getting

3567.599 --> 3577.789
weird

3569.63 --> 3577.789
[Music]

3579.119 --> 3584.099
and this is by the way all of what I'm

3581.04 --> 3585.48
saying now is all based on interactions

3584.099 --> 3588.2400000000002
out of the past

3585.48 --> 3591.54
because like in my 20s

3588.24 --> 3593.8999999999996
I had so much more an elaborate social

3591.54 --> 3593.9
life

3595.38 --> 3598.28
so much more

3599.099 --> 3604.559
but a lot of it would be kind of aimless

3601.319 --> 3607.2
it's mostly just me studying people

3604.559 --> 3610.5
finding some ground and then finding out

3607.2 --> 3615.0789999999997
people and like how do they feel there

3610.5 --> 3615.079
like I'm just fascinated by that

3627.98 --> 3633.78
treat people as weakness

3631.5 --> 3635.64
yeah but that's just projection though

3633.78 --> 3638.4
every time our colored when people say

3635.64 --> 3639.96
it's a weakness it's just them being

3638.4 --> 3641.4500000000003
afraid

3639.96 --> 3643.44
of their weakness

3641.45 --> 3646.14
[Music]

3643.44 --> 3648.299
like if nobody ever lets you express

3646.14 --> 3650.46
anything vulnerable about yourself yeah

3648.299 --> 3653.9
then you will

3650.46 --> 3653.9
just see it as weakness

3653.94 --> 3659.099
but you will not be able to deal with it

3656.22 --> 3660.7799999999997
or evolve it just lock it up all the

3659.099 --> 3664.2200000000003
time then it doesn't evolve then that

3660.78 --> 3664.2200000000003
part of you doesn't mature

3664.74 --> 3671.16
everything has a function it's up to you

3668.339 --> 3674.04
to find out what that function is

3671.16 --> 3677.04
but if you only suppress it then how can

3674.04 --> 3680.339
you find a function for it

3677.04 --> 3683.9
yeah and one of the few things that does

3680.339 --> 3683.9
not fall under that is gay

3684.54 --> 3691.079
none of that is natural anyway

3687.78 --> 3693.0
it's all Escapist addictive behavior

3691.079 --> 3698.48
where you ignore

3693.0 --> 3698.48
things that try to cheaply emulate

3698.579 --> 3702.92
a thrilling or loving experience

3704.64 --> 3707.94
foreign

3705.89 --> 3712.04
[Music]

3707.94 --> 3712.04
that's what gays do most of the time

3715.339 --> 3718.92
okay and

3717.48 --> 3721.44
dude

3718.92 --> 3722.52
whether I like it or not I pay attention

3721.44 --> 3726.299
and

3722.52 --> 3729.0
gay roommate downstairs yeah and his

3726.299 --> 3731.4
boyfriend from recently

3729.0 --> 3733.319
he has like a boyfriend every half year

3731.4 --> 3735.78
another one or whatever

3733.319 --> 3738.66
I pay attention to that I pay attention

3735.78 --> 3742.079
to the silent moments even like between

3738.66 --> 3745.2
them like I whether I [ __ ] like it or

3742.079 --> 3747.2400000000002
not I get a look into his romance life

3745.2 --> 3748.98
and I'm really uncomfortable about him

3747.24 --> 3750.54
and I've now had to even tell him like

3748.98 --> 3753.299
close the [ __ ] door when you're

3750.54 --> 3755.94
making out okay I mean it I don't want

3753.299 --> 3758.88
to walk downstairs and subtly see two

3755.94 --> 3760.68
guys [ __ ] kissing next to me didn't

3758.88 --> 3763.2000000000003
say that part but just said like close

3760.68 --> 3766.5
the [ __ ] door

3763.2 --> 3769.5
right but beside that gross part the

3766.5 --> 3772.02
mega or whatever I get to see

3769.5 --> 3775.04
their overall stance and interaction and

3772.02 --> 3777.54
I get to see that with male and female

3775.04 --> 3781.16
relationships too like when my roommate

3777.54 --> 3781.16
has a boyfriend over right

3781.44 --> 3789.0
with these gaze it doesn't work

3785.4 --> 3792.42
they got so many unconnecting silent

3789.0 --> 3795.18
pauses like almost all of them

3792.42 --> 3798.96
it's like they're pretending to be like

3795.18 --> 3802.02
a couple but it doesn't work

3798.96 --> 3805.98
they're just pretending they're making

3802.02 --> 3808.319
it work by pretending

3805.98 --> 3810.599
to illusions

3808.319 --> 3813.92
heaped up together pretending like it's

3810.599 --> 3813.92
real and it doesn't work

3815.819 --> 3822.299
like negative frustration continually

3819.42 --> 3825.42
comes seeping out

3822.299 --> 3828.2
on the side inside of moments

3825.42 --> 3828.2000000000003
all that

3828.66 --> 3834.54
I've never seen gays that were in

3831.54 --> 3837.24
relationships that didn't have that

3834.54 --> 3838.859
they always had that

3837.24 --> 3841.74
like

3838.859 --> 3844.74
it's emotionally unstable

3841.74 --> 3846.24
like every time I've never seen like a

3844.74 --> 3847.6189999999997
really emotionally stable gay

3846.24 --> 3850.64
relationship

3847.619 --> 3850.6400000000003
never seen it

3850.98 --> 3858.7400000000002
right and I mean men and women can be

3853.799 --> 3858.74
slightly unstable too but like

3858.9 --> 3862.339
their biology

3862.38 --> 3868.26
makes it work better

3864.96 --> 3872.339
it's like the opposite hormones it's

3868.26 --> 3875.2200000000003
like they get in a fight or whatever

3872.339 --> 3877.5589999999997
Then There usually can be love afterward

3875.22 --> 3880.3799999999997
and the chemistry of all that works just

3877.559 --> 3883.579
better it just works better it that's

3880.38 --> 3883.579
how it's supposed to work

3883.74 --> 3890.299
and with men and men that doesn't work

3887.04 --> 3895.16
it doesn't work that way there's no

3890.299 --> 3895.16
natural cycle of resolve

3895.799 --> 3899.0
that's what I've seen

3901.319 --> 3908.4
like with gays the best you can get out

3904.5 --> 3911.16
of that is a really solid friendship

3908.4 --> 3912.42
and the gays that actually discontinue

3911.16 --> 3917.339
sex

3912.42 --> 3919.2000000000003
those are the ones that actually last

3917.339 --> 3922.2
those are the ones that actually stay

3919.2 --> 3925.2
together because if they're into sex

3922.2 --> 3928.68
then it just doesn't last it never does

3925.2 --> 3932.64
I've never seen it last in gay couples

3928.68 --> 3934.2
that that are like into gay sex it never

3932.64 --> 3936.9
lasts then

3934.2 --> 3939.48
because it is disrupts that potential

3936.9 --> 3942.079
for that type of friendship that can

3939.48 --> 3942.079
make it last

3945.299 --> 3951.079
anyway I I don't even want to know so

3947.94 --> 3951.079
much about this [ __ ]

3953.96 --> 3958.26
that's what you get when you're

3956.04 --> 3960.619
continually surrounded by gays for a

3958.26 --> 3960.619
decade

3964.26 --> 3970.0200000000004
and I even during that period even like

3967.079 --> 3972.7200000000003
as the years progressed I got just ever

3970.02 --> 3974.339
more intolerant for it until the last

3972.72 --> 3977.04
couple of times

3974.339 --> 3980.46
I would literally just like yell it out

3977.04 --> 3983.52
like no I don't I'm not gay get away

3980.46 --> 3985.559
from me I like At first I would be like

3983.52 --> 3987.42
yeah I'll just let them

3985.559 --> 3990.3590000000004
it's like no

3987.42 --> 3992.16
I'm I'm Stoke about it and eventually I

3990.359 --> 3994.14
just couldn't handle it anymore it was

3992.16 --> 3998.0589999999997
just like I'm so [ __ ] sick of this

3994.14 --> 3998.0589999999997
game everywhere and can't handle this

4004.94 --> 4011.38
what about Earth being flat though

4009.2 --> 4011.3799999999997
foreign

4016.48 --> 4021.98
yeah but that's like that's the slang a

4019.46 --> 4025.2200000000003
it's a weakness if you're emotionally

4021.98 --> 4027.619
unstable really badly

4025.22 --> 4029.5989999999997
that can be gay but it's mostly though

4027.619 --> 4031.7000000000003
the response to it right it's like being

4029.599 --> 4033.6400000000003
emotionally stable and then not really

4031.7 --> 4035.1189999999997
and admitting that

4033.64 --> 4037.7599999999998
[Music]

4035.119 --> 4042.92
admitting not admitting that you're

4037.76 --> 4044.42
you're not doing well with it right that

4042.92 --> 4046.94
you don't have it under control that's

4044.42 --> 4049.28
when it becomes kind of gay really

4046.94 --> 4053.2400000000002
because if somebody is just like

4049.28 --> 4056.5
unstable like that I mean that's not gay

4053.24 --> 4056.5
it's what they do with it

4059.059 --> 4064.6400000000003
are they abusing it are they like oh but

4061.4 --> 4068.42
I mentally ill so I can't help it or

4064.64 --> 4070.8799999999997
they're just like no I'm way better

4068.42 --> 4073.64
like I am much better I'm not that

4070.88 --> 4075.319
unstable and they and then they act

4073.64 --> 4079.2799999999997
unstable and then they're just like no

4075.319 --> 4081.079
I'm not unstable like that's kind of gay

4079.28 --> 4083.02
okay

4081.079 --> 4086.9
right denial

4083.02 --> 4089.2599999999998
delusion lying that's the real bad part

4086.9 --> 4089.26
of it

4094.94 --> 4098.26
[Music]

4104.6 --> 4107.679
oh zept happy

4129.259 --> 4131.98

side moxie

4136.339 --> 4140.5599999999995
I didn't really pay too much attention

4138.199 --> 4140.5599999999995
though

4152.12 --> 4154.599999999999

but I fixed it in time

4384.679 --> 4390.9800000000005
I I saved lives did I hope so lumpy gas

4388.04 --> 4392.9
in the vacuum I mean I still I'm never

4390.98 --> 4394.36
gonna forget how I was literally

4392.9 --> 4399.199
screaming

4394.36 --> 4402.44
on my show in 2020 take the facts and

4399.199 --> 4404.839999999999
die take the facts I mean I was [ __ ]

4402.44 --> 4407.9
desperate to get that out

4404.84 --> 4410.12
and I thought that with the shock

4407.9 --> 4412.639999999999
irony of it

4410.12 --> 4416.96
that that would just like really snap

4412.64 --> 4419.659000000001
people out of it and hopefully it did oh

4416.96 --> 4421.82
I hopefully I I dissuaded a whole bunch

4419.659 --> 4424.159
of people that tuned in back then to to

4421.82 --> 4426.259999999999
do it because so many people were just

4424.159 --> 4428.9
like so eager to try it

4426.26 --> 4430.280000000001
because of the potential advantages that

4428.9 --> 4431.0599999999995
they thought they would have because of

4430.28 --> 4434.239
it

4431.06 --> 4437.06
and it was [ __ ] up man

4434.239 --> 4439.339999999999
was so [ __ ] up that was going on and

4437.06 --> 4441.14
I'm really glad that it was still able

4439.34 --> 4442.52
to have a channel I mean look at all the

4441.14 --> 4444.5
people that all did all the

4442.52 --> 4446.96
presentations and they got all banned

4444.5 --> 4448.58
from YouTube so many of you flat

4446.96 --> 4450.199
earthers got banned from YouTube because

4448.58 --> 4453.92
of that remember

4450.199 --> 4457.159
not me I would just tell people take the

4453.92 --> 4460.64
facts and die then if you want it right

4457.159 --> 4464.299999999999
and later like viruses don't even exist

4460.64 --> 4467.54
and yeah I hope that enough people have

4464.3 --> 4470.4400000000005
caught on to that

4467.54 --> 4470.44
those things

4471.32 --> 4476.0
but I don't know I don't know how many

4473.3 --> 4478.04
lives I saved like that

4476.0 --> 4482.08
a lot of people probably didn't really

4478.04 --> 4482.08
tell me about it afterward

4484.699 --> 4491.599999999999
but it's also because I was I just got a

4488.84 --> 4493.64
lot of hostile attention all around even

4491.6 --> 4495.08
from Flat earthers because of like the

4493.64 --> 4497.84
whole

4495.08 --> 4498.92
Bob Empire thing going on on top of

4497.84 --> 4502.400000000001
everything

4498.92 --> 4504.14
and I would just like no but yeah they

4502.4 --> 4506.0
might think they're all my enemies but

4504.14 --> 4508.360000000001
like I have to save them because in the

4506.0 --> 4510.86
future they won't be

4508.36 --> 4512.719
they're just in a phase where they're

4510.86 --> 4515.0199999999995
stupid enough to get caught up in this

4512.719 --> 4515.02
[ __ ]

4516.08 --> 4519.92
like I have to save all those people

4518.06 --> 4522.92
that don't know what they're doing so

4519.92 --> 4527.32
that later when they will

4522.92 --> 4527.32
figure it out they're not dead

4527.659 --> 4531.699
and yeah hopefully that works

4539.179 --> 4544.78
I mean now everybody knows by now it's

4542.06 --> 4548.360000000001
like oh looks it gives you blood clots

4544.78 --> 4550.94
yeah that's like so like generic like

4548.36 --> 4553.58
everybody knows that now

4550.94 --> 4556.4
I mean you'd have to like literally live

4553.58 --> 4558.8
under a rock if you didn't know about

4556.4 --> 4560.9
that right now

4558.8 --> 4562.6990000000005
you'd have to have be cut off from the

4560.9 --> 4566.0
internet for like three years straight

4562.699 --> 4568.58
without ever leaving your place

4566.0 --> 4570.14
did not know about that and then you

4568.58 --> 4572.42
probably like gets to have somebody

4570.14 --> 4574.280000000001
deliver groceries and then they'd still

4572.42 --> 4575.96
tell you like because it's like it's

4574.28 --> 4577.88
impossible to escape this information

4575.96 --> 4580.64
right now

4577.88 --> 4582.88
but in 2020 everything was censored and

4580.64 --> 4582.88
so

4583.64 --> 4587.1990000000005
you had to be more creative

4589.58 --> 4595.82
and my creativity led me to but what if

4593.659 --> 4598.36
I'm for the vax

4595.82 --> 4601.34
and I'm just

4598.36 --> 4603.62
eugenicist on top of it look at how

4601.34 --> 4607.96
ahead of the curve I was

4603.62 --> 4607.96
just by yelling take the facts and die

4608.54 --> 4614.48
well

4609.8 --> 4615.9800000000005
maybe nah this is [ __ ] uh

4614.48 --> 4620.0199999999995
because now there's like the

4615.98 --> 4620.0199999999995
anti-population movement apparently

4621.98 --> 4628.04
this is really crazy

4624.86 --> 4631.46
but yeah by combining it by being for it

4628.04 --> 4635.679
because it was Lethal I kind of got

4631.46 --> 4635.679
through I didn't get kicked off

4637.82 --> 4642.799999999999
it's like the only time I ever even got

4640.76 --> 4644.780000000001
censored is when I

4642.8 --> 4646.52
made the joke

4644.78 --> 4648.62
right

4646.52 --> 4652.719
that the

4648.62 --> 4655.46
the virus was made up in

4652.719 --> 4658.219
but if you say that apparently that's

4655.46 --> 4659.659
like a permanent censorship tag you

4658.219 --> 4662.719
because that's like

4659.659 --> 4665.179
it's a copyrighted narrative

4662.719 --> 4667.1
that's what I think is actually what it

4665.179 --> 4669.679
is because I don't even believe any of

4667.1 --> 4671.320000000001
that is real because it's all made of

4669.679 --> 4674.12
horseshit surrounding supposed

4671.32 --> 4677.36
experimentation with viruses and none of

4674.12 --> 4680.42
it is real because viruses don't exist

4677.36 --> 4683.12
this is like oh how did the virus do

4680.42 --> 4687.56
this no

4683.12 --> 4689.84
viruses don't exist it's all fiction and

4687.56 --> 4692.6
this fiction but this particular fiction

4689.84 --> 4696.32
was copyrighted and if you mentioned

4692.6 --> 4698.6
that on any social media platform you

4696.32 --> 4703.159
got kicked off

4698.6 --> 4705.8
but why because it was secret because it

4703.159 --> 4708.879999999999
was true or because there was a serious

4705.8 --> 4708.88
copyright on it

4711.679 --> 4715.6
it's like that's their story

4716.12 --> 4720.34
that's like the future narrative story

4721.52 --> 4724.580000000001
that they're rolling out again they're

4723.38 --> 4727.219
oh they're getting all these

4724.58 --> 4730.4
recognitions in Congress oh yeah it

4727.219 --> 4732.92
really did happen oh yes yeah the

4730.4 --> 4734.9
fictional [ __ ] situation that's fake

4732.92 --> 4737.96
literally impossible oh yeah that did

4734.9 --> 4741.62
really happen wow it got censored

4737.96 --> 4745.179
because it was real yeah yeah it was

4741.62 --> 4745.179
made up all of it

4749.42 --> 4753.7390000000005
yeah nothing happened there wasn't

4752.06 --> 4757.400000000001
anything

4753.739 --> 4761.178999999999
anything influenced the world to like

4757.4 --> 4764.78
get people to get like really

4761.179 --> 4767.92
long issues then it's probably

4764.78 --> 4767.92
related to

4768.86 --> 4772.0599999999995
5G or something

4774.86 --> 4778.179
getting rolled out

4786.38 --> 4792.7390000000005
right but I'm not yeah

4788.96 --> 4796.82
I did try to wake up a lot of people and

4792.739 --> 4800.0
warn them seriously not to take it

4796.82 --> 4802.48
and then later like take it or and die

4800.0 --> 4802.48
right

4803.42 --> 4808.46
and I don't know how much I got through

4805.52 --> 4810.38
to people it's not like I was the only

4808.46 --> 4812.06
one doing it I was just the only one

4810.38 --> 4813.62
doing it and not getting kicked off

4812.06 --> 4816.679
YouTube

4813.62 --> 4818.659
because I was because of my because I

4816.679 --> 4821.0
wasn't just rolling out oh here's the

4818.659 --> 4824.0
video of the doctor oh yeah oh yeah no

4821.0 --> 4825.739
no I didn't do that because that's what

4824.0 --> 4827.42
got you kicked off so I didn't do that

4825.739 --> 4830.599999999999
because I wasn't a [ __ ] I'm like I

4827.42 --> 4832.76
have to do it right now like a soldier

4830.6 --> 4834.620000000001
like we have to fight them right now

4832.76 --> 4837.5
yeah but there's a freaking landmines

4834.62 --> 4840.38
there I have to go right there what do

4837.5 --> 4843.08
you think was gonna happen you idiot

4840.38 --> 4844.9400000000005
yeah so I didn't do that I wasn't a

4843.08 --> 4846.98
[ __ ] idiot that's just gonna step on

4844.94 --> 4848.48
a landmine

4846.98 --> 4851.36
sorry

4848.48 --> 4853.459999999999
no offense to any soldiers that had that

4851.36 --> 4855.219
happen to them terrible

4853.46 --> 4858.56
but I mean

4855.219 --> 4860.96
terrible metaphor actually I just didn't

4858.56 --> 4864.02
get kicked off but I still mentioned to

4860.96 --> 4867.14
say about it what I felt needed to be

4864.02 --> 4869.360000000001
said to try to get through to people how

4867.14 --> 4870.679
they were being fooled and being allured

4869.36 --> 4874.299999999999
in

4870.679 --> 4874.3
with false promises

4876.62 --> 4882.76
and I don't know how many people I ended

4879.32 --> 4882.759999999999
up saving doing that

4884.84 --> 4890.12
I don't know how much I was shared back

4888.14 --> 4892.64
then I don't know how many people were

4890.12 --> 4894.86
even watching you know I don't really

4892.64 --> 4896.06
know in general how many people watch my

4894.86 --> 4898.339999999999
show

4896.06 --> 4901.4800000000005
I mean right now it says 20 watching

4898.34 --> 4901.4800000000005
well that's nothing

4903.98 --> 4908.48
although my videos do get a lot more

4906.26 --> 4909.8
views after I guess it's because I'm so

4908.48 --> 4911.9
early

4909.8 --> 4914.7390000000005
a lot of people it's just too early to

4911.9 --> 4914.739
them to be there

4917.84 --> 4922.179
anyway let's read what you guys have

4919.58 --> 4922.179
been saying

4932.0 --> 4936.38
yeah yeah that's funny one more color

4934.46 --> 4939.199
yeah

4936.38 --> 4940.52
yeah I'm not even gonna get into the

4939.199 --> 4942.98
reasoning

4940.52 --> 4946.06
from the pro vaxers I'm not even getting

4942.98 --> 4946.0599999999995
into that at all

4946.34 --> 4950.659000000001
because that's all just Stockholm

4948.199 --> 4953.5
reasoning

4950.659 --> 4953.5
it all is

4956.0 --> 4961.4
right they just want it to those people

4959.179 --> 4963.8
took it and then ended up like being

4961.4 --> 4965.839999999999
bound to like they just want to be told

4963.8 --> 4968.6
it's safe right

4965.84 --> 4972.08
it's that game it's like a conditioning

4968.6 --> 4973.34
game it's like when the the doctors from

4972.08 --> 4977.42
on top

4973.34 --> 4981.1990000000005
when they say it's safe it's over that's

4977.42 --> 4984.14
when it's over and so they get into this

4981.199 --> 4986.419999999999
pyramid scheme and this pyramid scheme

4984.14 --> 4988.64
like game where it's like everybody has

4986.42 --> 4990.92
to take it because then they're finally

4988.64 --> 4993.860000000001
gonna say that it's safe

4990.92 --> 4995.96
because it's not about reality anymore

4993.86 --> 4997.88
about what actually happens and whether

4995.96 --> 5000.94
things are real and what is safe and

4997.88 --> 5003.9400000000005
what isn't it's about they just want the

5000.94 --> 5007.839999999999
game to continue and it only continues

5003.94 --> 5011.62
when it's set from top down it's finally

5007.84 --> 5013.719
done enough people have taken the shot

5011.62 --> 5016.54
it's over

5013.719 --> 5018.699
that's what they really do it for not

5016.54 --> 5020.26
for the reality they've been caught up

5018.699 --> 5022.839999999999
in the game

5020.26 --> 5024.88
mentally

5022.84 --> 5026.92
because that game is continually being

5024.88 --> 5029.5
proper yeah reinforced through

5026.92 --> 5032.1990000000005
propaganda throughout those years

5029.5 --> 5034.78
for us the two years was continual

5032.199 --> 5037.54
always there's that's a that suggestion

5034.78 --> 5039.759999999999
just be part of it and then once enough

5037.54 --> 5040.6
then it's finally safe and then we beat

5039.76 --> 5042.52
it

5040.6 --> 5044.5
but it would never happen it would

5042.52 --> 5047.56
always be more and oh yeah we need

5044.5 --> 5051.219
another one you know how this goes so

5047.56 --> 5054.34
people that end up arguing for what you

5051.219 --> 5058.179
said like everybody has to take it

5054.34 --> 5060.52
or or we're not protected it could

5058.179 --> 5063.04
mutate in you because you didn't take it

5060.52 --> 5066.1
and then we're in danger again that yeah

5063.04 --> 5068.8
that's all Stockholm reasoning

5066.1 --> 5071.56
it it comes from

5068.8 --> 5074.02
just they just need to be told from the

5071.56 --> 5075.04
boss from the one that gave them the

5074.02 --> 5077.679
thing

5075.04 --> 5080.98
the shot whatever they just need to be

5077.679 --> 5083.02
told it's finally over that's what why

5080.98 --> 5085.299999999999
it's all

5083.02 --> 5087.580000000001
the motivation they had like that's why

5085.3 --> 5089.08
they do these things why their reason is

5087.58 --> 5090.82
that why they tell other people you need

5089.08 --> 5094.12
to take it because it's about whether

5090.82 --> 5096.94
the top down will tell them it's over

5094.12 --> 5103.48
yeah

5096.94 --> 5106.44
it's a Stockholm syndrome based response

5103.48 --> 5106.44
I hope you understand

5115.719 --> 5119.62
right and that's why I don't give it any

5118.12 --> 5121.719
attention and don't complain about it

5119.62 --> 5124.0599999999995
really I mean it's good that somebody

5121.719 --> 5127.14
mentions it sometimes

5124.06 --> 5127.14
but I mean it's

5127.42 --> 5132.84
there's nothing new about it people kind

5130.0 --> 5132.84
of figured it out

5138.1 --> 5142.780000000001
and I mean I don't think anybody out

5140.32 --> 5145.0
there really even says those kinds of

5142.78 --> 5149.199
things anymore unless they are literally

5145.0 --> 5151.48
paid to as a paid chill to advertise for

5149.199 --> 5154.48
one of these

5151.48 --> 5154.48
Medical

5155.02 --> 5158.46
product companies

5160.54 --> 5164.44
and then they might still roll out the

5162.58 --> 5166.659
[ __ ] but that's literally because

5164.44 --> 5169.659
they're paid chills to do that

5166.659 --> 5171.58
because no person like out there that

5169.659 --> 5174.58
isn't being paid for it is is still

5171.58 --> 5176.28
echoing those kinds of things

5174.58 --> 5180.5199999999995
am I right

5176.28 --> 5184.86
maybe trolls on purpose

5180.52 --> 5184.860000000001
but in general I don't think so

5188.199 --> 5192.599999999999
and certainly not out there in the real

5190.36 --> 5192.599999999999
world

5199.54 --> 5202.08
hmm

5213.699 --> 5218.259999999999
yeah but

5215.739 --> 5223.32
you're saying that one brand was more

5218.26 --> 5223.320000000001
dangerous that all depends on the region

5225.34 --> 5231.76
it it really does it's like different

5229.5 --> 5234.159
batches for different regions I'm

5231.76 --> 5236.4400000000005
talking around the world like this stuff

5234.159 --> 5239.08
that was

5236.44 --> 5241.0
put into the medical experimentation in

5239.08 --> 5242.5599999999995
the United States well was very

5241.0 --> 5244.54
different per region in the United

5242.56 --> 5247.06
States but all of that was very

5244.54 --> 5249.4
different from what they actually

5247.06 --> 5251.080000000001
rolled out in Europe in European

5249.4 --> 5253.9
countries

5251.08 --> 5255.94
so it was like different everywhere you

5253.9 --> 5258.339999999999
can't say oh this was the dangerous one

5255.94 --> 5259.48
that was the same yeah that's in that

5258.34 --> 5262.6
region

5259.48 --> 5264.339999999999
but you take it another place and it's a

5262.6 --> 5266.26
completely different

5264.34 --> 5268.4800000000005
composition of what is dangerous and

5266.26 --> 5272.26
what isn't it's like

5268.48 --> 5274.299999999999
it was very wild over the place like

5272.26 --> 5278.34
they did just a wide range of

5274.3 --> 5278.34
experimentation and it was completely

5279.159 --> 5283.9
chaotically mixed

5281.5 --> 5286.32
was not just one product that everybody

5283.9 --> 5286.32
takes

5297.04 --> 5302.219
brand new yeah that's that's why I'm not

5299.139 --> 5302.219
saying the brand names

5302.92 --> 5307.139
don't want to give them any more

5304.54 --> 5307.139
advertisement

5320.02 --> 5325.06
what

5322.3 --> 5328.0
are you talking about

5325.06 --> 5330.280000000001
oh fight to Flat earthy at e advertised

5328.0 --> 5333.04
for it yeah I'm not surprised but I

5330.28 --> 5335.62
think he actually took those

5333.04 --> 5338.82
those shots

5335.62 --> 5341.98
it's probably not doing too well for him

5338.82 --> 5344.5599999999995
I mean most of the

5341.98 --> 5346.0599999999995
the batches that went to England were

5344.56 --> 5348.76
really bad

5346.06 --> 5351.96
England got like really seriously

5348.76 --> 5351.96
assaulted with that stuff

5370.48 --> 5376.0
yeah

5372.88 --> 5378.28
right yeah I lumpy and he has probably

5376.0 --> 5380.46
all kinds of physiological issues right

5378.28 --> 5380.46
now

5380.62 --> 5384.099999999999
blood issues I mean that's the first

5382.54 --> 5387.04
thing that changes right that's

5384.1 --> 5391.96
Universal if you have a non

5387.04 --> 5393.94
uh non Placebo batch saline right if you

5391.96 --> 5396.699
got saline you're just lucky you are

5393.94 --> 5398.739
just really freaking lucky

5396.699 --> 5401.32
but there's been plenty that didn't have

5398.739 --> 5403.239
saline and all of them all the ones that

5401.32 --> 5406.179
didn't get saline pretty much every

5403.239 --> 5411.659
brand they all got blood issues

5406.179 --> 5411.659
all of them like that's the first marker

5411.88 --> 5417.219
that's how you see it because there's

5414.04 --> 5420.04
nobody that got the non-saline shot that

5417.219 --> 5422.219
doesn't have weird blood issues somehow

5420.04 --> 5424.6
that's the first thing they test too

5422.219 --> 5425.5
because that's where you see what you

5424.6 --> 5428.56
got

5425.5 --> 5429.76
that's the yeah and I've seen like

5428.56 --> 5431.5
videos

5429.76 --> 5433.54
where they show it under a microscope

5431.5 --> 5438.52
the different types of blood and even

5433.54 --> 5441.1
like putting a droplet of the vaccine on

5438.52 --> 5442.659000000001
there and then see how it immediately

5441.1 --> 5445.2390000000005
changes the blood like under the

5442.659 --> 5447.339999999999
Microsoft pretty impressive information

5445.239 --> 5449.32
so but that's

5447.34 --> 5451.900000000001
that's the first place you notice it

5449.32 --> 5454.36
your blood changes and it may give all

5451.9 --> 5457.9
kinds of coagulation problems and

5454.36 --> 5459.639
well-known blood cloth issues

5457.9 --> 5462.28
but it doesn't necessarily have to be

5459.639 --> 5463.84
fatal or immediately especially if

5462.28 --> 5465.58
you're not a professional supporter

5463.84 --> 5467.6990000000005
because professional supporters they're

5465.58 --> 5470.98
the ones that are gonna get the most

5467.699 --> 5473.678999999999
detriment from the clothing effect

5470.98 --> 5476.94
they're the ones that certainly fall

5473.679 --> 5476.9400000000005
over because of that [ __ ]

5477.219 --> 5482.199
right

5478.84 --> 5484.32
because they need the blood flow the

5482.199 --> 5484.32
most

5484.48 --> 5492.339999999999
right so anyway I feel really really

5488.02 --> 5495.1
happy and I'm a pure blood or whatever

5492.34 --> 5498.179
I did actually take a couple of vaccines

5495.1 --> 5498.179
when I was younger

5499.179 --> 5503.82
but my parents were never really for it

5501.58 --> 5503.82
anyway

5506.08 --> 5510.639
I was actually like oh do I need to what

5508.42 --> 5513.219
do I need to shut it's good right like

5510.639 --> 5515.1990000000005
because Star Trek says so like all the

5513.219 --> 5516.88
Sci-Fi says that taking a shot is really

5515.199 --> 5520.0599999999995
good you need it

5516.88 --> 5522.78
I was [ __ ] up man I feel like so like

5520.06 --> 5522.780000000001
oh my God

5524.739 --> 5529.32
and my parents were kind of neutral

5526.78 --> 5529.32
about it

5529.9 --> 5534.82
or maybe they just let me ramble on as

5533.5 --> 5537.4
seeing it as like oh I'm being

5534.82 --> 5539.5599999999995
influenced by sci-fi but never really

5537.4 --> 5541.9
got any of it they would eventually

5539.56 --> 5544.360000000001
always talk me out of it

5541.9 --> 5546.82
but sometimes I watch the news and it's

5544.36 --> 5550.9
like oh this new version and I'm like oh

5546.82 --> 5553.599999999999
should I get that Mom Dad

5550.9 --> 5556.54
I was like I was like eager to get

5553.6 --> 5557.9800000000005
euthanized basically because I was a

5556.54 --> 5559.9
[ __ ] idiot

5557.98 --> 5561.459999999999
little kid that just thought that oh

5559.9 --> 5563.259999999999
it's on the television oh that's the way

5561.46 --> 5565.179
you do it and they had never thought

5563.26 --> 5567.6990000000005
that that was just there to get you

5565.179 --> 5570.82
killed that it's Eugenics programming

5567.699 --> 5573.879999999999
it's like oh this is the future you can

5570.82 --> 5576.5199999999995
trust the doctors it's also modern they

5573.88 --> 5580.4800000000005
take a shot that means you should too in

5576.52 --> 5583.719
your time and we'll get there together

5580.48 --> 5585.82
yeah I didn't realize that

5583.719 --> 5587.92
and a lot of the times I wish that I

5585.82 --> 5589.719
would just catch on to that sort of

5587.92 --> 5592.78
thing quicker

5589.719 --> 5596.5
I was so freaking naive

5592.78 --> 5598.239
and I mean really mortifyingly naive

5596.5 --> 5602.08
sometimes

5598.239 --> 5604.9
like in my pre-teens and my teens

5602.08 --> 5606.9
I had a serious nature to me too but I

5604.9 --> 5610.42
was also so

5606.9 --> 5613.12
unbelievably naive about

5610.42 --> 5616.36
like what people would do I I basically

5613.12 --> 5619.36
I couldn't handle evil I could not

5616.36 --> 5620.44
accept that it was real it had to be a

5619.36 --> 5622.48
mistake

5620.44 --> 5624.4
that's how I saw it and that's how I

5622.48 --> 5626.5599999999995
kept sorry seeing it

5624.4 --> 5629.799999999999
until

5626.56 --> 5632.92
yeah I rolled into the

5629.8 --> 5635.320000000001
into the darkness

5632.92 --> 5638.1990000000005
with these people and they basically

5635.32 --> 5639.88
just showed it where before I was all

5638.199 --> 5641.98
joking about it's like yeah that's all

5639.88 --> 5645.6990000000005
just Scare Tactics right

5641.98 --> 5648.459999999999
it's up to just to keep down the Sheep

5645.699 --> 5650.199
I was like yeah I get it I mean yeah you

5648.46 --> 5651.82
need dumb people you need them under

5650.199 --> 5654.219
control you're gonna tell it's a really

5651.82 --> 5655.599999999999
scary stories and then they

5654.219 --> 5659.08
don't

5655.6 --> 5660.820000000001
get as as open and they'd like retract

5659.08 --> 5663.04
more and they stay more close to home

5660.82 --> 5664.9
and like yeah that makes sense right but

5663.04 --> 5668.82
then it turned out that that [ __ ] really

5664.9 --> 5668.82
happens and I'm like

5669.1 --> 5676.0
foreign

5671.38 --> 5677.1
like no no my world it can't be that

5676.0 --> 5681.0
evil

5677.1 --> 5681.0
it can't be

5683.32 --> 5687.099999999999
that really [ __ ] me up

5685.54 --> 5690.48
guys

5687.1 --> 5690.4800000000005
still talking about it

5694.48 --> 5699.239
I mean that moment where that happened

5696.82 --> 5699.239
just

5699.88 --> 5704.1990000000005
I literally thought I just landed in

5702.1 --> 5706.2390000000005
hell like suddenly like all the world

5704.199 --> 5708.94
just suddenly burned up it was all

5706.239 --> 5710.98
charcoal everywhere

5708.94 --> 5713.86
like

5710.98 --> 5717.94
it's like and it

5713.86 --> 5721.0599999999995
it also made me resent God too because

5717.94 --> 5724.678999999999
in a way I was like no it has to be good

5721.06 --> 5724.679
it has to be good

5724.78 --> 5730.179
because God wouldn't make it

5727.3 --> 5733.12
any other way but I mean

5730.179 --> 5735.04
I completely misunderstood God's nature

5733.12 --> 5736.36
back then and I just thought oh it's all

5735.04 --> 5739.84
just good guy

5736.36 --> 5742.12
and technically is but it's like It's a

5739.84 --> 5745.42
combination of being a good guy but also

5742.12 --> 5750.36
being absolutely [ __ ] mercilessly

5745.42 --> 5750.36
brutally confronting and testing

5750.58 --> 5756.42
yeah and that's the part that I just

5752.56 --> 5756.42
couldn't really understand about it

5757.48 --> 5761.678999999999
about God

5759.82 --> 5763.96
and about reality

5761.679 --> 5766.42
has taken me a very long time to

5763.96 --> 5768.34
basically get used to that to be able to

5766.42 --> 5770.62
accept it and that's also part of the

5768.34 --> 5772.78
reason why even though I'm 43 I

5770.62 --> 5775.84
literally feel like I've just become

5772.78 --> 5779.139
adolescent like in an actual growth

5775.84 --> 5781.2390000000005
curve it took me so [ __ ] long guys

5779.139 --> 5783.3
but it's like yeah I think I'm finally

5781.239 --> 5785.919999999999
ready to be adult now

5783.3 --> 5787.719
adult-minded adult spirited I can

5785.92 --> 5791.1990000000005
actually

5787.719 --> 5794.76
deal with the craziness and and the

5791.199 --> 5797.799999999999
craziness that people will experience

5794.76 --> 5800.62
when they find out the world isn't the

5797.8 --> 5803.4400000000005
way that they wanted it to be and that

5800.62 --> 5805.12
they can't handle it right that I as an

5803.44 --> 5807.94
individual can now deal with other

5805.12 --> 5811.179
people dealing with that thing that I

5807.94 --> 5813.4
absolutely could not deal with when I

5811.179 --> 5815.56
was 20.

5813.4 --> 5818.379999999999
and that's the big difference and that's

5815.56 --> 5820.06
part of the reason I felt it coming I

5818.38 --> 5822.58
saw it coming even when I was younger I

5820.06 --> 5824.860000000001
knew like one day I will get it and I

5822.58 --> 5826.54
still feel young it's not like

5824.86 --> 5829.54
getting confronted with these things

5826.54 --> 5832.0
were like it sucked the life out of me

5829.54 --> 5834.82
and I suddenly became old because of the

5832.0 --> 5838.239
horror that didn't happen either I'm

5834.82 --> 5842.0199999999995
still young I still feel young it's just

5838.239 --> 5844.299999999999
that it's taken so long it's taken so

5842.02 --> 5845.679
[ __ ] long to be able to handle this

5844.3 --> 5849.84
truth

5845.679 --> 5849.84
it's taken me so long guys

5853.36 --> 5858.46
and if I ever get kids I mean I'm gonna

5855.52 --> 5859.92
make some serious work

5858.46 --> 5864.34
off

5859.92 --> 5867.54
facing that with my kid like I gotta be

5864.34 --> 5870.28
there I got to be there to like

5867.54 --> 5872.98
really prepare them

5870.28 --> 5875.92
really prepare for how [ __ ] up dark

5872.98 --> 5878.62
this world can be right and not by

5875.92 --> 5882.34
pushing the darkness onto them

5878.62 --> 5884.38
but to like be extremely Vigilant way

5882.34 --> 5886.06
more Vigilant than my parents were they

5884.38 --> 5888.54
were so loose with me they were so

5886.06 --> 5888.54
trusting

5893.56 --> 5900.0
and in retrospect it's a miracle I got

5896.86 --> 5900.0
out of any of that alive

5900.699 --> 5905.799999999999
with all that freedom and and not

5903.699 --> 5907.659
actually being able to handle reality

5905.8 --> 5910.4800000000005
because if you have a lot of freedom

5907.659 --> 5914.28
guys and you can't handle reality that's

5910.48 --> 5914.28
a super dangerous combination

5915.52 --> 5922.179
the darkness starts to meddle with you

5918.34 --> 5924.58
when you're in that position yeah

5922.179 --> 5926.92
when you have freedom but you can't

5924.58 --> 5930.54
handle reality it's a dangerous

5926.92 --> 5930.54
spiritual chemistry

5936.88 --> 5941.4400000000005
because a lot of people end up then

5939.28 --> 5944.199
starting to make like their own fantasy

5941.44 --> 5946.36
construction as a form of Escape of a

5944.199 --> 5948.759999999999
form of permanent escapism and then draw

5946.36 --> 5951.699
other people in it too I mean you could

5948.76 --> 5953.38
argue that the entire sjw movement is

5951.699 --> 5957.04
exactly that

5953.38 --> 5959.92
it's a permanent Escapist alternative

5957.04 --> 5962.56
reality interpretation

5959.92 --> 5965.32
like an alternative world of seeing

5962.56 --> 5967.84
things and was conjured by people that

5965.32 --> 5970.9
literally cannot handle reality or

5967.84 --> 5973.6
sought to create a framework for people

5970.9 --> 5975.339999999999
that cannot handle reality but with the

5973.6 --> 5977.56
end result that they can't handle it

5975.34 --> 5980.1990000000005
even worse

5977.56 --> 5982.92
that they'll be stuck within that

5980.199 --> 5985.78
framework that we enslave to that group

5982.92 --> 5988.36
mindset and they'll probably end up

5985.78 --> 5989.5599999999995
doing things that a normal person just

5988.36 --> 5992.739
wouldn't do

5989.56 --> 5996.780000000001
because normal person isn't so desperate

5992.739 --> 5996.78
to be part of such a group

6000.719 --> 6004.8
but it was based as an escape for

6003.36 --> 6008.239
reality

6004.8 --> 6008.2390000000005
it was created like that

6009.54 --> 6016.62
and if you get in it

6011.82 --> 6019.199
then the bridges between reality and

6016.62 --> 6021.9
where you're at will become longer and

6019.199 --> 6023.638999999999
eventually they'll crumble and burn

6021.9 --> 6026.5199999999995
and you won't go back you're like no

6023.639 --> 6029.639
this is it this is my group and I'll do

6026.52 --> 6031.139
everything I'll I'll kill I'll die for

6029.639 --> 6034.9800000000005
them I'll

6031.139 --> 6036.78
I'll know I'll I'll go over every border

6034.98 --> 6038.218999999999
of humiliation

6036.78 --> 6040.32
for them

6038.219 --> 6043.62
because there is no more world for them

6040.32 --> 6046.82
to return to the bridge has become the

6043.62 --> 6046.82
Gap has become too wide

6049.679 --> 6054.54
and those people do actually end up dead

6052.139 --> 6057.78
a lot of the time

6054.54 --> 6060.3
suicide mostly

6057.78 --> 6062.88
because they just can't return

6060.3 --> 6065.0
they can't return to normal they're just

6062.88 --> 6067.32
stuck in that and they went too far

6065.0 --> 6069.179
sacrificed too much for the alternative

6067.32 --> 6072.32
reality and then you can't go back to

6069.179 --> 6072.32
the normal reality anymore

6076.56 --> 6083.6990000000005
yeah sjw is a really [ __ ] up group and

6081.239 --> 6085.86

half hour show or something

6345.48 --> 6350.5199999999995

6350.52 --> 6355.580000000001
when I go dream walking I also lose

6352.92 --> 6355.58
track of time

6356.52 --> 6360.26

lot of it

6376.94 --> 6382.4
Stockholm Syndrome

f e d cutlery

6717.6 --> 6721.58
uh David that's hilarious

6722.76 --> 6727.320000000001
I would like a Nathan Oakley teaspoon

6725.4 --> 6729.0599999999995
though that would be pretty cool right

6727.32 --> 6733.099999999999
to have a teaspoon

6729.06 --> 6733.1
with Nathan Oakley's head on it

6743.34 --> 6748.159000000001
if it's silver if it's a silver coated

6745.739 --> 6752.119
spoon though

6748.159 --> 6752.119
I mean that was pretty funny

6761.639 --> 6767.159000000001
right and I mean it would be pretty

6764.219 --> 6770.04
badass even like

6767.159 --> 6772.138999999999
with Ballers you're just drinking tea

6770.04 --> 6773.639
and then they're like oh they're the

6772.139 --> 6777.1990000000005
satellites did you hear about that and

6773.639 --> 6777.1990000000005
then you're like showing them your

6777.54 --> 6782.34
your tea with the spoon and then like

6780.48 --> 6784.799999999999
Nathan Oakley staring you in the face

6782.34 --> 6787.32
with that look at the spoon will have to

6784.8 --> 6788.46
have his face with that certain look of

6787.32 --> 6789.96
course

6788.46 --> 6792.4800000000005
right

6789.96 --> 6794.28
the typical Nathan Oakley look

6792.48 --> 6796.32
and then there's a good chance that that

6794.28 --> 6797.94
person will be like

6796.32 --> 6800.78
uh

6797.94 --> 6800.78
what's that

6801.96 --> 6806.84
or like wait is that Nathan Oakleys

6809.34 --> 6812.119000000001
I don't know

6815.699 --> 6823.94
and yes I'd be willing to have my face

6818.58 --> 6823.94
used as part of an fed spoon set

6825.719 --> 6833.159
I mean why not fed Silver Spoon set

6830.58 --> 6836.639
like Nathan Oakley

6833.159 --> 6838.619
Arwin Brian's logic

6836.639 --> 6841.619
uh who else came on the car yeah

6838.619 --> 6843.239

6855.719 --> 6860.54
Silver Spoons

6857.52 --> 6860.540000000001

6868.199 --> 6873.0199999999995
exactly you get it LSG

6875.4 --> 6879.259999999999

has t-shirts and all that and

6935.88 --> 6939.02
the FED print

6942.719 --> 6947.1

6945.3 --> 6949.5
I mean he doesn't really make any money

6947.1 --> 6951.92
off it it's just like an easy merch

6949.5 --> 6951.92
system

6953.58 --> 6957.86

7009.92 --> 7016.34

7012.619 --> 7018.679
just that I mean it's an older thing

7016.34 --> 7021.34
it's from the Isle of Man days when when

7018.679 --> 7021.34
he made that

7036.92 --> 7038.9800000000005
um

7039.38 --> 7044.4800000000005

7041.84 --> 7047.360000000001
any kind of like a new project he needs

7044.48 --> 7049.5199999999995
to have that computer of his gun he

7047.36 --> 7051.259999999999
needs to have it rounded out it needs to

7049.52 --> 7053.599
be over

7051.26 --> 7056.06
because he's spending all his extra time

7053.599 --> 7059.02

7114.679 --> 7117.46
annoying

7117.86 --> 7123.0199999999995

thing that they're doing

7270.5 --> 7273.52
it's part of the stick

7281.239 --> 7285.379999999999
I don't think they ever even met face to

7283.52 --> 7288.080000000001
face

7285.38 --> 7290.179
I don't even know if QE actually knows

7288.08 --> 7292.28
what Betty's face looks like I I've

7290.179 --> 7294.08
never seen her face

7292.28 --> 7296.48
so

7294.08 --> 7298.28
yeah

7296.48 --> 7301.839999999999
yeah just the thing they're doing I

7298.28 --> 7301.84
don't I find it annoying

7321.02 --> 7325.96
yeah that's very strange Richard I don't

7323.179 --> 7325.96
know what's going on

7329.48 --> 7334.5199999999995
would I buy the 20 Globe Terminator

7333.08 --> 7338.13
pillow

7334.52 --> 7347.35
well if I had money to spend why not

7338.13 --> 7347.35
[Music]

7350.42 --> 7355.219
I mean yeah

7353.239 --> 7357.5199999999995
could be worse things to have on a

7355.219 --> 7357.52
pillow

7376.099 --> 7381.9800000000005
yeah yeah what Moxie said it could have

7379.099 --> 7384.26
been it could have been like the YouTube

7381.98 --> 7387.5
moderators

7384.26 --> 7388.76
because there's weirdos out there I

7387.5 --> 7391.159
don't think they're doing that anymore

7388.76 --> 7395.119000000001
but there was like a team

7391.159 --> 7398.42
it was probably some project

7395.119 --> 7400.098999999999
but they were just completely Reckless

7398.42 --> 7403.28
and political

7400.099 --> 7406.219
just people that are just like

7403.28 --> 7407.84
Shadow band like timing people out like

7406.219 --> 7409.699
there were moderators when they're not

7407.84 --> 7412.3
even there

7409.699 --> 7412.299999999999
like

7412.34 --> 7416.9800000000005
just [ __ ] around with people

7417.44 --> 7420.86
I've seen that happen that happened to

7419.119 --> 7424.659
me too I would get somewhere and I would

7420.86 --> 7424.659
just get I would just disappear

7427.54 --> 7433.9
what no I'm not doing a bobble head I

7430.52 --> 7433.900000000001
[ __ ] hate bobble heads

7440.36 --> 7445.699
who plays bobble head

7443.719 --> 7448.2390000000005
I would put a bobble head is in the

7445.699 --> 7448.239
fireplace

7448.88 --> 7452.08
I hate those things

7479.0 --> 7482.0
what

7482.06 --> 7485.5
a good action figure

7486.88 --> 7492.679
action figurines or whatever

7490.099 --> 7495.5
I mean yeah

7492.679 --> 7497.119
just playing with your dolls again

7495.5 --> 7500.119
right

7497.119 --> 7502.159
just like Darth helmet I mean I play

7500.119 --> 7503.9
with my dolls again it's a video game

7502.159 --> 7506.299999999999
it's pretty much that it's just all

7503.9 --> 7510.699
these figurines all this

7506.3 --> 7510.6990000000005
it's just playing with digital dolls

7514.94 --> 7520.58
but no I'm not I'm not about dolls

7518.96 --> 7523.9
thanks

7520.58 --> 7523.9
accepting video games

7523.94 --> 7529.879999999999
yeah mini statue

7527.119 --> 7532.94
look I have nothing against it

7529.88 --> 7534.92
beside that it's kind of gay

7532.94 --> 7537.379999999999
but I mean there's other things that are

7534.92 --> 7540.139
a lot more gay so

7537.38 --> 7545.26
but still it is like it is kind of

7540.139 --> 7545.26
identified as being like a little

7545.54 --> 7549.4
in the direction of you know

7556.76 --> 7564.08
but I mean I'm I wasn't the Transformers

7559.099 --> 7565.639
and they're basically many statues too

7564.08 --> 7570.199
so

7565.639 --> 7573.9800000000005
just got a tomato oh tornado warning

7570.199 --> 7577.58
but you said tomato warning

7573.98 --> 7580.178999999999
a tornado warning in New Hampshire

7577.58 --> 7580.179
what

7580.52 --> 7584.38
isn't that usually a lot more south

7611.5 --> 7616.58
okay yeah I don't know what that is more

7614.42 --> 7619.599
color but I mean I do have a couple of

7616.58 --> 7619.599
words banned

7621.199 --> 7624.28
but not a lot

7638.36 --> 7641.259999999999
okay

7653.56 --> 7656.8
which island

7664.219 --> 7668.719
hmm

7666.08 --> 7670.159
yeah that's weird Mark I mean you it

7668.719 --> 7672.44
could be a

7670.159 --> 7675.0199999999995
an internet connection type thing I've

7672.44 --> 7677.178999999999
had that at times too whereas like

7675.02 --> 7679.639
every time I try to type something it

7677.179 --> 7682.34
like it says error and then I have to do

7679.639 --> 7685.219
it again or it like doesn't show up it's

7682.34 --> 7687.26
I don't have it right now but I had that

7685.219 --> 7691.2390000000005
like a year ago where that would happen

7687.26 --> 7691.2390000000005
a lot was quite annoying

7697.699 --> 7702.138999999999
it's just another one of those weird

7699.92 --> 7703.82
things that happened in YouTube where

7702.139 --> 7706.36
you just can't really Place why that

7703.82 --> 7706.36
certainly happens

7706.42 --> 7709.619
[Music]

7710.9 --> 7713.9
okay

7732.8 --> 7736.719
yeah that's weird more colored

7760.28 --> 7762.94
hmm

7771.92 --> 7775.599
Gremlin GPC

7782.78 --> 7787.599
yeah I don't know what the hell is going

7785.0 --> 7787.599
on with that

7788.119 --> 7795.139
it's just there's all kinds of weird

7790.94 --> 7798.219
learning things happening out there with

7795.139 --> 7798.219
the robots

7800.599 --> 7806.2390000000005
I think we're probably continually being

7803.179 --> 7810.02
exposed to all kinds of like experiments

7806.239 --> 7812.48
or like learning experiments from the

7810.02 --> 7815.1990000000005
computer side and we're not even made

7812.48 --> 7815.199
aware of it

7832.04 --> 7837.86
just to see the normal responses to

7834.199 --> 7841.119
Monday things yes that could be

7837.86 --> 7841.119
yeah that's a good point

7844.04 --> 7848.06
I mean what the [ __ ] is up with those

7846.32 --> 7849.5599999999995
crazy ass

7848.06 --> 7852.5
but

7849.56 --> 7853.76
messages remember that I haven't seen

7852.5 --> 7856.46
one in a while

7853.76 --> 7859.099
but that like happens every two months

7856.46 --> 7861.619
somebody comes back gets in there and

7859.099 --> 7862.58
asks me some stupid thing about just

7861.619 --> 7866.0
like

7862.58 --> 7867.739
like oh did you see the car crash into

7866.0 --> 7869.84
the window

7867.739 --> 7873.0199999999995
that happened like

7869.84 --> 7875.659000000001
a kilometer away from you Arwin like

7873.02 --> 7878.900000000001
that sort of weird [ __ ]

7875.659 --> 7880.82
like what the [ __ ]

7878.9 --> 7883.759999999999
is that

7880.82 --> 7886.28
like nobody talks like that how the hell

7883.76 --> 7888.860000000001
did you even know anything like that

7886.28 --> 7890.54
like that's obviously like a robot

7888.86 --> 7893.179
assembled message

7890.54 --> 7895.04
why the hell does that happen here

7893.179 --> 7898.76
who the [ __ ] thinks that they can just

7895.04 --> 7901.5199999999995
send their chat GPT robot or whatever

7898.76 --> 7903.5
to communicate with me and that they're

7901.52 --> 7906.46
not just gonna get kicked off like what

7903.5 --> 7906.46
the hell is your problem

7909.98 --> 7913.82
is that somebody just trying to troll me

7912.5 --> 7916.159
you guys think

7913.82 --> 7917.659
they're like well they maybe they're

7916.159 --> 7919.4
hoping like haha we're gonna just make

7917.659 --> 7921.379999999999
him think like they were being invaded

7919.4 --> 7923.48
by robots or something

7921.38 --> 7924.8
maybe it's just that but it's just a

7923.48 --> 7926.9
troll

7924.8 --> 7929.119000000001
or maybe it's just somebody being really

7926.9 --> 7930.259999999999
weird and not really realizing what

7929.119 --> 7932.119
they're doing and they're just like oh

7930.26 --> 7933.7390000000005
I'm gonna talk through

7932.119 --> 7935.719
chat gbd

7933.739 --> 7937.339999999999
maybe somebody out there like in the

7935.719 --> 7941.54
South Park episode just can only

7937.34 --> 7943.52
communicate to me through chat GPD

7941.54 --> 7945.92
they're like no I'm never talking to

7943.52 --> 7947.4400000000005
anybody ever again except through chat

7945.92 --> 7950.179
GPT

7947.44 --> 7952.4
who knows man I mean

7950.179 --> 7954.679
if South Park had an episode about it

7952.4 --> 7956.839999999999
it's probably out there

7954.679 --> 7960.099
it's probably people that are really

7956.84 --> 7962.659000000001
doing that probably young weird people

7960.099 --> 7965.54
teenagers and [ __ ] they might actually

7962.659 --> 7968.659
be doing that sort of [ __ ] out there

7965.54 --> 7972.159
so maybe that's what's been

7968.659 --> 7972.159
getting in my Jab

8006.639 --> 8012.78
is no yeah dank that's interesting but

8015.159 --> 8019.78
no I don't think so I think people just

8017.739 --> 8022.36
need to be able to distinguish what's

8019.78 --> 8023.86
really not I mean I can freaking

8022.36 --> 8026.92
distinguish

8023.86 --> 8029.139
like oh look at my Advanced assembled

8026.92 --> 8032.7390000000005
chat GPT

8029.139 --> 8035.1990000000005
poem or something or just a little short

8032.739 --> 8037.959999999999
story and I'm like yeah there is no

8035.199 --> 8040.598999999999
[ __ ] way ever

8037.96 --> 8044.7390000000005
that I'm gonna lay eyes on that and not

8040.599 --> 8048.96
within two seconds immediately spot how

8044.739 --> 8051.879999999999
it's not man written yeah two seconds

8048.96 --> 8053.32
immediately I know that's not written by

8051.88 --> 8055.2390000000005
a person

8053.32 --> 8058.0599999999995
and the same goes for these comments

8055.239 --> 8059.5599999999995
left in my chat sometimes it's like yeah

8058.06 --> 8061.2390000000005
I just have to look at that two seconds

8059.56 --> 8063.42
and I know that's not written by a

8061.239 --> 8063.419999999999
person

8065.5 --> 8070.44
that may change no I doubt it

8085.599 --> 8090.639
that internet Theory

8087.579 --> 8091.78
yeah but I I don't think so I think that

8090.639 --> 8093.88
I know

8091.78 --> 8095.5
you know what I've been thinking about

8093.88 --> 8097.2390000000005
it some more I won't imagine brought

8095.5 --> 8099.579
that up too like oh maybe it's all

8097.239 --> 8101.5599999999995
filled with Bots like most of Twitter

8099.579 --> 8105.219
might be Bots

8101.56 --> 8108.9400000000005
well here's a reverse theory of that

8105.219 --> 8112.32
what if people are actually the ones

8108.94 --> 8112.32
that are turning into Bots

8113.619 --> 8118.0
and that these people

8115.659 --> 8122.92
look like they're Bots

8118.0 --> 8126.82
because they are acting like Bots

8122.92 --> 8130.119
not Bots acting like people but people

8126.82 --> 8132.219
acting like Bots

8130.119 --> 8134.82
think about it think about the influence

8132.219 --> 8134.82
of this world

8137.38 --> 8142.719
it is ariman yeah ariman

8140.139 --> 8147.06
what is the influence of ariman death

8142.719 --> 8147.06
first and foremost death the end

8147.3 --> 8154.84
extinguishing but it's also roboticness

8152.099 --> 8157.06
automaton optimization

8154.84 --> 8159.88
yeah people giving up on life

8157.06 --> 8162.04
demoralized they go on to an autopilot

8159.88 --> 8165.28
and they might even some of them even

8162.04 --> 8166.42
attained like autopilot traits within it

8165.28 --> 8168.579
it's like

8166.42 --> 8170.679
they don't know how to tackle the world

8168.579 --> 8172.119
anymore consciously so they're just like

8170.679 --> 8175.679
doing this

8172.119 --> 8175.679
robotic response

8175.719 --> 8179.8
and I think that that's actually what is

8178.48 --> 8182.44
happening

8179.8 --> 8184.96
there are real people in there they're

8182.44 --> 8188.32
just they lost their minds so they've

8184.96 --> 8190.9
become robots they're

8188.32 --> 8194.399
humans that lost their humanity and have

8190.9 --> 8194.399
turned into robots

8195.34 --> 8199.960000000001
slaves

8197.8 --> 8202.179
yeah that's the origin work for a robot

8199.96 --> 8204.16
if anybody doesn't know that by now then

8202.179 --> 8207.16
you know

8204.16 --> 8207.16
laughs

8208.059 --> 8212.979
like what time machine you came through

8210.519 --> 8215.58
from the past but I mean everybody knows

8212.979 --> 8215.58
that by now

8216.46 --> 8221.38
but I think that that's I think more

8218.38 --> 8222.88
people have just turned into automatons

8221.38 --> 8224.438999999998
because they can't handle reality

8222.88 --> 8226.358999999999
anymore it's kind of funny how that

8224.439 --> 8229.599
comes together with

8226.359 --> 8232.380000000001
how I started this show

8229.599 --> 8232.380000000001
isn't it

8233.439 --> 8237.58
people not being able to handle the

8235.359 --> 8240.04
truth how the world turned out not to be

8237.58 --> 8242.219
as idyllic as first perceived a lot of

8240.04 --> 8242.219000000001
people

8242.32 --> 8246.939
don't

8243.939 --> 8249.58
hold strong in the face of that

8246.939 --> 8252.460000000001
realization that the world isn't as

8249.58 --> 8256.3
idyllic as you first perceived it

8252.46 --> 8259.018999999998
they adapt in panic

8256.3 --> 8261.938999999998
and they reduce themselves to like

8259.019 --> 8264.219000000001
non-threatening robot like oh the person

8261.939 --> 8268.800000000001
will certainly not see me as a threat if

8264.219 --> 8268.8
I act like this because I'm just a robot

8268.96 --> 8273.58
predictable

8270.939 --> 8276.880000000001
it's very clear what

8273.58 --> 8278.679
what things I am distracted by it's like

8276.88 --> 8280.479
oh I'm very enraged about this well

8278.679 --> 8282.399
that's very predictable that's less

8280.479 --> 8284.26
threatening because you know that person

8282.399 --> 8286.719
is just going to be obsessed over that

8284.26 --> 8288.880000000001
stupid dichotomy it's not going to be a

8286.719 --> 8291.938999999998
threat so maybe people are literally

8288.88 --> 8296.858999999999
like in fear

8291.939 --> 8301.0
just turning themselves into robots

8296.859 --> 8304.78
just so they won't be kicked out and be

8301.0 --> 8307.479
forced to re-face the reality and face

8304.78 --> 8310.66
that it's not acceptable

8307.479 --> 8313.559
that's not acceptable to be that robot

8310.66 --> 8313.559
as part of the system

8313.899 --> 8318.16
what I think a lot of people have they

8316.12 --> 8320.320000000002
have literally just surrendered to

8318.16 --> 8322.84
ariman they basically surrendered to

8320.32 --> 8324.34
Satan and they're just like yeah I can't

8322.84 --> 8326.559
do anything about it so I'm just gonna

8324.34 --> 8328.84
do whatever it is to be part of this

8326.559 --> 8330.759999999998
swarm I'm a robot

8328.84 --> 8332.62
I'm gonna sound stupid but it doesn't

8330.76 --> 8334.479
matter because I'm not a threat to the B

8332.62 --> 8335.800000000001
system

8334.479 --> 8338.679
and

8335.8 --> 8340.719
yeah eventually they might kill you

8338.679 --> 8342.88
since you are part of the basis then

8340.719 --> 8345.039999999999
that's the way they operate but until

8342.88 --> 8347.32
that time you'll have a very strong

8345.04 --> 8350.800000000001
conviction that that that won't happen

8347.32 --> 8352.84
and that you are on The Winning Side

8350.8 --> 8354.88
and that you don't have to make all this

8352.84 --> 8358.059
effort to be a stronger person that you

8354.88 --> 8361.479
can just be that robot

8358.059 --> 8364.358999999999
you're like the winning robot yay you're

8361.479 --> 8366.46
on The Winning Side you can take on that

8364.359 --> 8368.559000000001
Glory of being stronger even though you

8366.46 --> 8370.178999999998
aren't actually that stronger but you

8368.559 --> 8371.979
can think of yourself as being that

8370.179 --> 8374.679
stronger and you can just keep going be

8371.979 --> 8376.3
that robot and then one day

8374.679 --> 8379.24
the Beast will

8376.3 --> 8381.899
chew you up all of a sudden it's like Oh

8379.24 --> 8385.32
I'm a good robot

8381.899 --> 8385.32
and you're dead

8388.24 --> 8393.66
so those robot people they don't end up

8391.42 --> 8393.66
well

8395.5 --> 8402.6
whose frustration and

8398.62 --> 8402.6
like restlessness and hurt

8403.24 --> 8409.539999999999
but they rarely stay like that for long

8406.54 --> 8413.26
eventually it starts to wear on their

8409.54 --> 8417.399000000001
health ignorance is very unhealthy

8413.26 --> 8420.82
if if you keep escaping stress

8417.399 --> 8423.82
like that degrading yourself they will

8420.82 --> 8426.939
become unhealthy and probably be forced

8423.82 --> 8429.039999999999
by the system to eventually like oh we

8426.939 --> 8431.92
need to fool everybody into some kind of

8429.04 --> 8433.960000000001
depopulation program again oh you're a

8431.92 --> 8435.82
really eager robot okay so you're gonna

8433.96 --> 8437.679999999998
be the front runner in convincing

8435.82 --> 8440.02
everybody to do that

8437.68 --> 8442.06
oh and you're actually going to do it

8440.02 --> 8443.02
and you're going to think it's the right

8442.06 --> 8446.5
thing

8443.02 --> 8448.479000000001
yeah now be a good boy and you roll out

8446.5 --> 8450.04
that project for us and oh yeah you

8448.479 --> 8452.5
might die in the process but it's all

8450.04 --> 8455.740000000002
for the greater good

8452.5 --> 8457.24
yeah and then those robots end up sick

8455.74 --> 8458.979
and dead

8457.24 --> 8462.16
or

8458.979 --> 8466.56
roll in some crazy thing

8462.16 --> 8466.56
that will [ __ ] them up even more

8480.76 --> 8485.14
right

8482.26 --> 8487.42
I mean it is in a way it is the satanic

8485.14 --> 8489.46
way it's like

8487.42 --> 8493.06
only like

8489.46 --> 8496.119999999999
if you're not infinitely evil and eager

8493.06 --> 8498.58
to exploit and destroy

8496.12 --> 8501.84
your fellow mankind then you don't

8498.58 --> 8501.84
deserve to survive

8509.08 --> 8514.899
kind of is like that that's what like if

8511.72 --> 8517.179999999998
you want to be part of the system

8514.899 --> 8519.519999999999
but you're not super brutal and

8517.18 --> 8524.1
anti-human then

8519.52 --> 8524.1
you will just end up dead eventually

8524.14 --> 8527.92
like they don't

8525.64 --> 8530.68
if you're a good willing person that's

8527.92 --> 8532.24
like too weak to face the reality and

8530.68 --> 8534.28
just like you want to be in the system

8532.24 --> 8537.399
well they you will be the first online

8534.28 --> 8539.859
to die for them foreign because they

8537.399 --> 8543.399
don't care about good willing trusting

8539.859 --> 8546.52
people they don't care about them at all

8543.399 --> 8550.72
they only care for people that are

8546.52 --> 8554.62
eager to do anything for power and to be

8550.72 --> 8555.819
as evil as imaginable

8554.62 --> 8557.979000000001
right

8555.819 --> 8560.14
those are the ones

8557.979 --> 8563.019999999999
that they give priority those are the

8560.14 --> 8565.479
ones that get really high paying jobs

8563.02 --> 8567.58
out of nowhere

8565.479 --> 8571.24
right

8567.58 --> 8573.939
those become politicians

8571.24 --> 8576.58
it's the filth that's very eager and

8573.939 --> 8578.62
Relentless it was just full-on like yes

8576.58 --> 8584.039999999999
we'll murder everybody

8578.62 --> 8584.04
yes like they'll do anything

8584.08 --> 8588.88
those are the ones that flow to the Top

8585.96 --> 8590.679999999998
If you're just eager to help out you

8588.88 --> 8591.819
just want to be helpful you just don't

8590.68 --> 8594.76
want to be a threat you want to be

8591.819 --> 8597.699999999999
helpful that's cool you join us and then

8594.76 --> 8601.06
they kill you very quickly they don't

8597.7 --> 8605.1
give a [ __ ] about good willing people

8601.06 --> 8605.1
in the B system they don't care

8605.2 --> 8613.319000000001
they only care about you if you're

8607.12 --> 8613.319000000001
willing to exploit and ruin other people

8616.78 --> 8620.92
because if you don't you're actually

8619.06 --> 8623.439
good willing then you're gonna have to

8620.92 --> 8625.479
defend and defend and eventually you'll

8623.439 --> 8628.6
find that you're not in their system at

8625.479 --> 8631.3
all they will work you out of it yeah if

8628.6 --> 8634.899000000001
you're not eagerly willing to murder

8631.3 --> 8637.119999999999
other people indirectly through crazy

8634.899 --> 8640.24
propaganda that'll get themselves killed

8637.12 --> 8643.02
or through adding poison

8640.24 --> 8643.02
somehow

8644.439 --> 8649.24
right terrible ideas or poison in the

8647.74 --> 8651.88
foot if you're not willing to contribute

8649.24 --> 8652.78
to that they will work you out of their

8651.88 --> 8657.279999999999
system

8652.78 --> 8659.439
they only want murderous monsters

8657.28 --> 8663.720000000001
those are the ones that rise to the top

8659.439 --> 8663.720000000001
that get power that get money

8663.819 --> 8670.359
right people that can relentlessly just

8667.18 --> 8673.54
have a mask and like genuinely be happy

8670.359 --> 8675.220000000001
about knowing how they are murdering

8673.54 --> 8677.740000000002
everybody yeah

8675.22 --> 8679.84
that's what you get to see now that's

8677.74 --> 8682.78
the system that's what's really there

8679.84 --> 8685.24
you can't get in it being a good person

8682.78 --> 8686.800000000001
ex thinking that you could change

8685.24 --> 8690.039999999999
anything about it

8686.8 --> 8692.74
it will only wear you down and try to

8690.04 --> 8694.979000000001
kill you and if it can't it will eject

8692.74 --> 8694.979
you

8700.3 --> 8706.14
another graphene so yeah I've seen the

8702.28 --> 8706.140000000001
videos going around that's pretty freaky

8706.72 --> 8713.26
it's like magnetic

8709.899 --> 8716.22
twirly thing yeah I've seen that

8713.26 --> 8716.22
freaky stuff

8717.46 --> 8720.0
anyway

8720.88 --> 8727.72
my point remains is that a lot of these

8724.359 --> 8730.08
people are Bots

8727.72 --> 8733.0
but they're not

8730.08 --> 8735.28
actually a computer program they're

8733.0 --> 8737.979
human Bots they're people that have just

8735.28 --> 8740.68
degraded themselves to being a robot to

8737.979 --> 8743.14
being an automaton in a system

8740.68 --> 8746.58
and this can even be like the good

8743.14 --> 8749.979
attack look at how many

8746.58 --> 8752.74
non-system propaganda based Bots there

8749.979 --> 8754.358999999999
are look at all these people responding

8752.74 --> 8756.16
to the sign of freedom and like

8754.359 --> 8758.5
supporting it and we're going to stop

8756.16 --> 8762.119999999999
them look at how much of a bot days

8758.5 --> 8762.12
people are becoming yeah

8762.479 --> 8769.358999999999
the resistance the opposition to the

8766.18 --> 8772.54
Deep State and to the New World Order

8769.359 --> 8776.56
they are becoming automatons

8772.54 --> 8779.140000000001
are you seeing it are you seeing how the

8776.56 --> 8781.66
supposed opposition

8779.14 --> 8787.66
to the evil system

8781.66 --> 8787.66
are starting to turn into automatons

8788.5 --> 8792.88
you know why

8790.06 --> 8796.899
because it's not working

8792.88 --> 8800.38
spreading the information isn't working

8796.899 --> 8805.358999999999
it's waking some people up a little

8800.38 --> 8808.119999999999
but the majority is just not responding

8805.359 --> 8811.960000000001
like the majority were just at this

8808.12 --> 8814.300000000001
point probably continue working even if

8811.96 --> 8816.64
suddenly like their neighboring town

8814.3 --> 8818.979
just got fire bombed and they just got

8816.64 --> 8821.858999999999
on the news is screaming burning people

8818.979 --> 8824.76
over the streets yeah it's

8821.859 --> 8824.76
again it's like yeah

8825.88 --> 8828.358999999999
yeah right

8828.46 --> 8833.858999999999
everybody's all hollowed out all robot

8831.28 --> 8836.2
sized Shell Shocked like they don't

8833.859 --> 8838.54
respond anymore

8836.2 --> 8842.08
and because of that

8838.54 --> 8844.78
the the alternative media people are

8842.08 --> 8846.76
getting even more noisy and more

8844.78 --> 8849.28
standardized more cookie cutter try to

8846.76 --> 8852.22
get more through to the Dumber people

8849.28 --> 8856.54
and they're all turning into robots in

8852.22 --> 8859.42
the process because it's not working

8856.54 --> 8861.939
yeah it's not

8859.42 --> 8863.68
it's not going to switch around the

8861.939 --> 8866.380000000001
system with all these people that are

8863.68 --> 8870.04
doing that they're not gonna stop doing

8866.38 --> 8871.539999999999
it just because it's known what they're

8870.04 --> 8874.78
doing

8871.54 --> 8877.84
yeah that's the difference it's not the

8874.78 --> 8881.140000000001
90s anymore yeah in the 90s is something

8877.84 --> 8883.54
really egregious came afloat in the news

8881.14 --> 8885.22
in the attention even if it were

8883.54 --> 8888.460000000001
suppressed I would have a giant shock

8885.22 --> 8891.16
wave and people would make it stop they

8888.46 --> 8894.16
would nip it in the butt now

8891.16 --> 8896.859
something horrific that is absolutely

8894.16 --> 8898.479
real comes afloat gets in the news it

8896.859 --> 8900.52
just goes around and it dissipates

8898.479 --> 8902.8
because people don't really respond

8900.52 --> 8904.84
anymore they're turning into robots more

8902.8 --> 8907.42
and more

8904.84 --> 8911.74
and the opposition to those people are

8907.42 --> 8913.72
also turning into robots because

8911.74 --> 8914.92
the other side is just not responding

8913.72 --> 8917.858999999999
anymore

8914.92 --> 8920.14
it seems like we can't wake them up out

8917.859 --> 8922.84
of it the the sleepers have have been

8920.14 --> 8925.539999999999
set in their ways they will go all the

8922.84 --> 8929.22
way to hell all the way to Hell on Earth

8925.54 --> 8929.220000000001
and they will not stop

8930.52 --> 8936.16
there's nothing you can say that will

8933.46 --> 8937.539999999999
make them stop

8936.16 --> 8941.859
you understand

8937.54 --> 8943.359
nothing you can say to make them stop

8941.859 --> 8947.1
this

8943.359 --> 8947.1
they will continue on

8948.46 --> 8952.599999999999
no matter what you say no matter what

8950.74 --> 8954.16
you do they're kind of hoping you'll

8952.6 --> 8956.859
just kill yourself

8954.16 --> 8959.02
it's just one less person they have to

8956.859 --> 8961.6
kill in the end

8959.02 --> 8965.1
that's how they see it that's how they

8961.6 --> 8965.1
actually see that

8967.479 --> 8974.38
and because of this overall situation

8970.3 --> 8977.56
it's growing worse there's only one

8974.38 --> 8979.119999999999
only one solution in the end

8977.56 --> 8982.319
and that is

8979.12 --> 8982.319000000001
Kill Them All

8983.02 --> 8989.62
foreign because it will never stop in

8987.58 --> 8992.319
any other way it's just going to keep

8989.62 --> 8995.62
rolling it's going to keep nothing that

8992.319 --> 8998.38
anybody does is going to make it stop

8995.62 --> 9000.62
only way to make it stop is to blow it

8998.38 --> 9000.619999999999
up

9000.96 --> 9005.88
is to actually

9003.02 --> 9007.859
disable those people doing it because

9005.88 --> 9013.938999999998
they are not going to stop so they will

9007.859 --> 9013.939
have to be made to stop with Force

9015.899 --> 9020.46
and there's a lot of them to be stopped

9018.359 --> 9023.54
yeah

9020.46 --> 9023.539999999999
a lot of them

9026.22 --> 9031.26
right because at first at first it might

9029.58 --> 9033.18
have been just a few really [ __ ] up

9031.26 --> 9035.22
evil people that concocted all these

9033.18 --> 9036.42
plans and made these systems a lot of

9035.22 --> 9037.92
people would just kind of work along

9036.42 --> 9040.02
with it

9037.92 --> 9042.66
they didn't really want to do it but now

9040.02 --> 9045.84
it's all been engrained for song it's

9042.66 --> 9047.64
been going for so long now if you kick

9045.84 --> 9049.56
that top off

9047.64 --> 9052.38
the rest

9049.56 --> 9054.66
still keep going

9052.38 --> 9056.699999999999
because they're just doing it now

9054.66 --> 9057.899
they're not just gonna stop because the

9056.7 --> 9060.300000000001
Top's gone

9057.899 --> 9061.979
it's big common thing it's something

9060.3 --> 9065.34
they do now

9061.979 --> 9067.019999999999
whether it was controlled top down or

9065.34 --> 9069.78
not

9067.02 --> 9073.68
and then the only way to stop it is to

9069.78 --> 9076.859
physically disable them

9073.68 --> 9079.92
and we've arrived to that point guys

9076.859 --> 9082.92
the time for a glorious sudden awaken

9079.92 --> 9085.979
that will make the Beast system fall in

9082.92 --> 9090.960000000001
on itself is over

9085.979 --> 9090.96
that can't happen anymore only

9091.319 --> 9096.319
force can make it stop now

9100.2 --> 9107.460000000001
been trying to warn people about this

9103.14 --> 9110.58
esoterically for a couple of years now

9107.46 --> 9114.08
the more time passes the more it becomes

9110.58 --> 9114.08
absolutely inevitable

9115.14 --> 9122.519999999999
because it's not gonna stop

9118.74 --> 9125.64
by just taking out the top or taking it

9122.52 --> 9129.18
over pushing it out of the way there's

9125.64 --> 9130.56
entire networks now out there yeah the

9129.18 --> 9133.68
U.N

9130.56 --> 9136.92
the U.N is providing for anti-human

9133.68 --> 9139.92
criminals on a mass scale

9136.92 --> 9142.859
like Mass murderers all over the world

9139.92 --> 9145.74
could literally get totally persecuted

9142.859 --> 9148.68
they said and they'll flee to these

9145.74 --> 9150.66
special U.N strongholds where just mass

9148.68 --> 9154.02
murders that could collectively have

9150.66 --> 9157.619999999999
murdered a billion people together and

9154.02 --> 9161.66
they'll all be kept there safe

9157.62 --> 9161.660000000002
because that's what the UN does now

9163.68 --> 9169.56
they protect criminals and people that

9166.68 --> 9170.460000000001
commit genocide that's what the U.N does

9169.56 --> 9172.619999999999
now

9170.46 --> 9174.839999999998
and that's what they will do

9172.62 --> 9177.720000000001
yeah this is no longer one [ __ ]

9174.84 --> 9181.02
Tyrant we're facing we're facing a giant

9177.72 --> 9182.899
Colossus of tyrants

9181.02 --> 9185.58
one after the other

9182.899 --> 9187.5
generations of tyrants and they're all

9185.58 --> 9192.18
banding together

9187.5 --> 9195.6
and they are going to try to destroy all

9192.18 --> 9200.460000000001
of humanity and they will not stop until

9195.6 --> 9200.460000000001
they have been physically disabled

9200.819 --> 9203.0
foreign

9209.15 --> 9216.279999999999
[Music]

9218.06 --> 9222.56
activity why don't you go look at their

9220.08 --> 9222.56
charters

9222.96 --> 9233.58
the U.N is completely depopulation gay

9226.68 --> 9236.28
now their total lgbtp yeah all of that

9233.58 --> 9238.56
haven't you seen the updates

9236.28 --> 9241.5
numpty

9238.56 --> 9243.84
yeah it's all written it's all written

9241.5 --> 9246.74
down yeah Alex Jones had a whole special

9243.84 --> 9246.74
about it yesterday

9248.1 --> 9254.640000000001
we literally see their documents yeah he

9251.64 --> 9258.019999999999
showed their documents where they say it

9254.64 --> 9258.019999999999
it's right there

9258.74 --> 9264.6
Waf is yeah the WF but that's just a

9262.2 --> 9267.84
front really it's a a front group it's

9264.6 --> 9270.18
more like a overt group

9267.84 --> 9273.06
the U.N is just a is a world

9270.18 --> 9275.720000000001
encompassing operation they're behind

9273.06 --> 9275.72
Waf

9276.06 --> 9281.039999999999
no need to be rude yeah there is a need

9278.7 --> 9283.560000000001
to be rude

9281.04 --> 9286.740000000002
there's definitely a need to be rude

9283.56 --> 9289.26
because you're [ __ ] ignorant

9286.74 --> 9293.24
if you don't know that the UN is [ __ ]

9289.26 --> 9293.24
Satan you're an idiot

9303.3 --> 9311.0
didn't call you names yeah well

9307.02 --> 9311.0
I don't care now get the [ __ ] out

9314.7 --> 9318.26
don't need no whining

9324.66 --> 9331.859
laughs

9326.899 --> 9333.96
right anyway it's not looking great

9331.859 --> 9337.5
and there probably will whenever to

9333.96 --> 9339.419999999998
leave just be a giant bloody

9337.5 --> 9342.5
situation and

9339.42 --> 9342.5
I don't know man

9344.939 --> 9350.1
I think it's probably gonna just turn

9346.859 --> 9351.6
into really big riots

9350.1 --> 9354.6
and like

9351.6 --> 9356.220000000001
people getting trampled to death

9354.6 --> 9358.640000000001
I think it's probably going to end up

9356.22 --> 9358.64
like that

9360.66 --> 9365.58
I don't know I'm not having I'm being a

9363.72 --> 9367.26
bit pessimistic right now maybe it's

9365.58 --> 9369.899
that freaking movie from yesterday yeah

9367.26 --> 9372.18
I'm gonna Blade the way up the serpent

9369.899 --> 9375.06
that thing really

9372.18 --> 9378.12
was dark

9375.06 --> 9380.34
oh yeah yeah oh oh I really think you're

9378.12 --> 9382.26
gonna stay here with that

9380.34 --> 9384.960000000001
[ __ ]

9382.26 --> 9389.899
[ __ ] little [ __ ]

9384.96 --> 9389.899
projecting little [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]

9391.26 --> 9395.42
yeah leave the Banning to me

9396.64 --> 9399.708999999999
[Music]

9402.08 --> 9405.93
don't worry about it

9405.0 --> 9409.219
all right

9405.93 --> 9409.219000000001
[Music]

9414.18 --> 9417.899
they will not know the joy that we once

9415.979 --> 9418.858999999999
had yeah that's correct more color they

9417.899 --> 9420.019999999999
want

9418.859 --> 9422.04
they will not know

9420.02 --> 9425.1
[Music]

9422.04 --> 9427.080000000002
and all we can do is really protect

9425.1 --> 9428.640000000001
their minds from the outside world and

9427.08 --> 9430.56
that means

9428.64 --> 9433.619999999999
a lot of work

9430.56 --> 9436.92
because their screens and crazy

9433.62 --> 9440.04
subliminal suggestions more weaponized

9436.92 --> 9442.8
than ever before

9440.04 --> 9445.979000000001
like they've devised things

9442.8 --> 9447.96
that they could it's like the serenity

9445.979 --> 9448.858999999999
movie from the Firefly series but the

9447.96 --> 9451.919999999998
movie

9448.859 --> 9455.52
they can literally just have a little

9451.92 --> 9457.56
short ad of like two seconds

9455.52 --> 9460.560000000001
they'll just like

9457.56 --> 9462.119999999999
do something with the mind of whoever's

9460.56 --> 9464.22
watching that especially if there are

9462.12 --> 9465.6
very little and you won't even know it

9464.22 --> 9468.06
as an adult because we're already

9465.6 --> 9470.28
saturated with influence we got all this

9468.06 --> 9472.08
shielding they won't know

9470.28 --> 9475.62
so if you bring your kid and they just

9472.08 --> 9478.56
look at a [ __ ] screen in a in a in a

9475.62 --> 9480.84
store in the electronic store that has a

9478.56 --> 9483.6
television in the window on which

9480.84 --> 9486.24
there's some ad like even that can [ __ ]

9483.6 --> 9488.220000000001
them up in that second in a [ __ ]

9486.24 --> 9491.58
second

9488.22 --> 9494.46
it's really bad guys the influence from

9491.58 --> 9496.14
media now is so atrocious like you

9494.46 --> 9498.119999999999
really need to protect your children

9496.14 --> 9500.279999999999
against that

9498.12 --> 9503.76
if you even can because if you're gonna

9500.28 --> 9506.939
like send them to public school the

9503.76 --> 9509.22
influence there is like even worse

9506.939 --> 9511.62
much more dangerous

9509.22 --> 9513.779999999999
like it's more dangerous to send your

9511.62 --> 9516.54
kid to like public school with what's

9513.78 --> 9518.76
going on there then it even is to let

9516.54 --> 9519.84
them free on the internet I'm not even

9518.76 --> 9523.16
kidding

9519.84 --> 9523.16
it's more dangerous

9523.319 --> 9527.279999999999
influence wise because there's like

9525.72 --> 9530.22
especially the United States there's

9527.28 --> 9532.979000000001
just [ __ ] pedos there in the schools

9530.22 --> 9536.039999999999
that I have records of having rape

9532.979 --> 9538.438999999998
children that are like literally

9536.04 --> 9541.380000000001
grooming your children there

9538.439 --> 9542.880000000001
and they're like you are not allowed to

9541.38 --> 9545.58
stop that

9542.88 --> 9547.74
even as a parent

9545.58 --> 9550.319
like they're allowed they're like

9547.74 --> 9552.38
getting away they're legally getting

9550.319 --> 9555.66
away through judges

9552.38 --> 9557.819
withholding information

9555.66 --> 9560.16
from parents

9557.819 --> 9563.399
involving their children I mean that's

9560.16 --> 9565.02
happening right now like

9563.399 --> 9567.3
yeah

9565.02 --> 9569.399000000001
protecting your children is like the

9567.3 --> 9570.358999999999
number one priority as any parent right

9569.399 --> 9572.46
now

9570.359 --> 9574.319
especially at that young age pre-teen

9572.46 --> 9577.5
age extremely important

9574.319 --> 9580.14
but also their entire teams like don't

9577.5 --> 9582.479
just let them go they'll want to

9580.14 --> 9585.119999999999
but I mean they'll just get a lot of

9582.479 --> 9588.358999999999
opportunities to completely [ __ ] them up

9585.12 --> 9589.740000000002
and abandon everything you taught them

9588.359 --> 9591.720000000001
yeah

9589.74 --> 9594.479
that's exactly what will happen if you

9591.72 --> 9598.56
just let them free right now out there

9594.479 --> 9601.199999999999
abandon everything you taught them step

9598.56 --> 9602.939
by step incrementally you'll think of

9601.2 --> 9604.979000000001
just oh just one little thing yeah no

9602.939 --> 9608.1
they'll throw it all overboard because

9604.979 --> 9610.56
everything out there is just pushing and

9608.1 --> 9612.78
pushing and pushing to make them throw

9610.56 --> 9614.819
it all overboard and a lot of people

9612.78 --> 9616.2
can't handle that pushing and they just

9614.819 --> 9618.0
give in

9616.2 --> 9620.939
and they become part of the swarm they

9618.0 --> 9624.26
become robotic

9620.939 --> 9624.26
and very miserable

9630.78 --> 9636.060000000001
so protect them keep them away

9632.76 --> 9639.74
homeschool and do it very serious also

9636.06 --> 9639.74
don't underestimate your child

9641.22 --> 9647.279999999999
see them as being exactly as smart as

9645.3 --> 9651.119999999999
you are

9647.28 --> 9653.819000000001
see that under the right moral guidance

9651.12 --> 9657.479000000001
they can reach and understand much

9653.819 --> 9658.5
higher than their typical age realize

9657.479 --> 9661.26
that

9658.5 --> 9663.66
But realize that in that ability of them

9661.26 --> 9665.34
to reach out like that intellectually it

9663.66 --> 9668.939
needs to be safe because if there's

9665.34 --> 9672.479
poisonous toxic influences they will

9668.939 --> 9672.479000000001
grow deranged

9675.6 --> 9682.62
so protect your children a lot

9679.859 --> 9686.04
keep them homeschooled keep them well

9682.62 --> 9689.460000000001
fed keep them away from media

9686.04 --> 9691.5
and I mean always away from it not just

9689.46 --> 9694.08
don't have the television on in your

9691.5 --> 9695.34
house like really keep media away from

9694.08 --> 9697.62
them

9695.34 --> 9699.42
don't let them even if possible don't

9697.62 --> 9701.160000000002
let them even know it can ex that

9699.42 --> 9703.979
there's something like that exists like

9701.16 --> 9706.439
hide your mobile from them never have

9703.979 --> 9709.14
your mobile on in your house so that

9706.439 --> 9711.42
they don't even know that it exists

9709.14 --> 9714.66
right if you can if that's possible

9711.42 --> 9718.14
somehow just get all of that away from

9714.66 --> 9720.319
them for as long as humanly possible

9718.14 --> 9720.319
foreign

9727.52 --> 9735.300000000001
it's a gigantic dose of poison after a

9732.66 --> 9738.0
dose of poison spiritually

9735.3 --> 9740.16
idea wise like you're not ready for it

9738.0 --> 9743.22
if you think that [ __ ] is bad out there

9740.16 --> 9746.28
right now you only have watched some of

9743.22 --> 9749.819
the layers yeah a kid will like stumble

9746.28 --> 9752.04
in it and get pulled all the way all the

9749.819 --> 9755.16
way to the end that's a pure nightmare

9752.04 --> 9757.380000000001
it's so [ __ ] surreal

9755.16 --> 9760.8
is dude

9757.38 --> 9763.22
keep your kids away from the [ __ ]

9760.8 --> 9763.22
media

9768.18 --> 9774.960000000001
yeah or before you know it your kids

9770.64 --> 9777.18
will be made to come out as demons

9774.96 --> 9778.979
they'll like get horn [ __ ]

9777.18 --> 9781.800000000001
transplants

9778.979 --> 9785.519999999999
yeah and they will say I am a demon

9781.8 --> 9787.92
that's my gender is demon yeah you think

9785.52 --> 9790.02
that's kind of silly looking silly

9787.92 --> 9793.02
sounding yeah well guess what guess what

9790.02 --> 9795.060000000001
the future is gonna hold for you exactly

9793.02 --> 9797.880000000001
that and they'll do it

9795.06 --> 9801.119999999999
and they'll do it to you

9797.88 --> 9804.24
keep your [ __ ] children away from

9801.12 --> 9806.819000000001
media press y'all as long as humanly

9804.24 --> 9809.34
possible and I think that Owen Benjamin

9806.819 --> 9811.92
by the way is doing a great job at that

9809.34 --> 9814.56
it seems like he's really keeping his

9811.92 --> 9817.5
kids away from that

9814.56 --> 9819.42
like they'll get recorded but they don't

9817.5 --> 9822.02
watch

9819.42 --> 9822.02
screens

9822.5 --> 9826.76
what the [ __ ] are you whining about

9828.479 --> 9833.84
I'll certainly keep my kids away from

9830.58 --> 9833.84
media if I ever get any

9835.92 --> 9841.74
but I mean it's

9838.38 --> 9844.679999999998
like I don't even know if I can get kids

9841.74 --> 9847.08
here in this country because they

9844.68 --> 9850.979000000001
literally force you to go to school and

9847.08 --> 9853.859
sit through sjw [ __ ] like that's they

9850.979 --> 9856.14
literally they kidnap your [ __ ] child

9853.859 --> 9859.16
they'll take your child away if you

9856.14 --> 9859.16
don't let them do that

9859.56 --> 9864.96
and I don't want to end up in jail for

9862.56 --> 9867.479
having literally beheaded [ __ ]

9864.96 --> 9869.819
pedophiles in sgw freaks that took my

9867.479 --> 9873.119999999999
channel away and then made me murder

9869.819 --> 9875.399
them yeah I don't want that to happen

9873.12 --> 9877.740000000002
because it will happen if they [ __ ]

9875.399 --> 9881.76
take my child for such a reason I will

9877.74 --> 9885.319
Slaughter you I will [ __ ] cut your

9881.76 --> 9885.319
limbs off one by one

9889.52 --> 9895.74
and I'll [ __ ] feel it and put it on

9892.38 --> 9899.358999999999
the [ __ ] internet too [ __ ] I will

9895.74 --> 9899.359
have you slaughtered

9904.34 --> 9909.28
[Music]

9909.3 --> 9914.759999999998
so yeah that's a little worrisome

9911.819 --> 9916.68
about this country if I find a wife

9914.76 --> 9919.28
there's a good chance I'm gonna go to

9916.68 --> 9919.28
another country

9919.979 --> 9925.14
just abandon this hell hole unless it

9923.399 --> 9927.84
can be turned around and I mean the

9925.14 --> 9930.599999999999
cabinet has fallen it could be that the

9927.84 --> 9932.04
whole [ __ ] transgender influence and

9930.6 --> 9934.979000000001
the

9932.04 --> 9937.68
forced sjw crap in the schools with

9934.979 --> 9939.979
little kids is gonna be made illegal

9937.68 --> 9939.979000000001
again

9953.76 --> 9956.76
foreign

9957.62 --> 9960.809000000001
[Music]

9984.08 --> 9987.8
thank you for sharing that

9991.38 --> 9996.599999999999
thankfully men can follow their children

9993.06 --> 10000.68
until they yeah they kind of can

9996.6 --> 10003.26
and it sounds really weird Mark I mean

10000.68 --> 10006.08
I feel like yet I feel I have that

10003.26 --> 10007.819
response like yeah right Arwin but I

10006.08 --> 10009.92
feel like yeah

10007.819 --> 10012.199999999999
if this [ __ ] goes over I want to like

10009.92 --> 10014.24
try to get like 10 kids

10012.2 --> 10016.04
I'll have it with multiple I like I

10014.24 --> 10018.619999999999
don't give a [ __ ] anymore guys I don't

10016.04 --> 10022.880000000001
give a [ __ ] I'll have freaking 10 kids

10018.62 --> 10025.819000000001
with three women I'll just [ __ ] do it

10022.88 --> 10027.679999999998
and people I will probably get sponsored

10025.819 --> 10029.779999999999
by this tape because of the massive

10027.68 --> 10033.2
population decline

10029.78 --> 10037.1
which is happening yeah and one should

10033.2 --> 10040.58
like no longer let all the drudges

10037.1 --> 10043.640000000001
from other countries in to try to take

10040.58 --> 10045.859
it over like in France well then you're

10043.64 --> 10047.66
really gonna need the population yeah

10045.859 --> 10051.58
and that's where I step and I'll be like

10047.66 --> 10051.58
yeah I'll make 10 kids I'll do it

10051.74 --> 10057.76
I'll start my own freaking school just

10054.2 --> 10057.76
to educate those 10 kids

10061.939 --> 10067.960000000001
but yeah it's it's a little Bravada

10065.359 --> 10067.960000000001
perhaps

10068.24 --> 10074.0
and yes if I'd had 10 kids I'd probably

10071.0 --> 10077.359
not really give them all

10074.0 --> 10079.819
the attention that they'd really require

10077.359 --> 10081.979000000001
but I mean yeah

10079.819 --> 10084.14
when you need to do it you need to do it

10081.979 --> 10087.319
you know

10084.14 --> 10092.14
and I'd be happy to provide

10087.319 --> 10092.14
for my nation in that sense at least

10093.979 --> 10101.84
they're all gonna be very talented and

10097.88 --> 10104.779999999999
creative and flexible and probably naive

10101.84 --> 10107.439
nature too but with much better guidance

10104.78 --> 10107.439
than I had

10108.8 --> 10114.14
like I'll be there to represent them and

10111.38 --> 10116.779999999999
to keep them safe

10114.14 --> 10119.0
and then much later in their 20s I'll

10116.78 --> 10121.1
dude if there be like me they'll I'd

10119.0 --> 10122.42
have kids all over me I'm gonna be

10121.1 --> 10124.7
pretty old by then

10122.42 --> 10126.979
but it'll be like oh yeah man it's like

10124.7 --> 10128.12
having 10 R wins do that all the time

10126.979 --> 10130.099999999999
around me

10128.12 --> 10133.220000000001
they're all just trying to work out and

10130.1 --> 10135.74
trying to deal with their impulses and

10133.22 --> 10137.199999999999
their insights and

10135.74 --> 10141.76
yeah

10137.2 --> 10141.76
I I actually I do that

10148.1 --> 10155.18
but I mean like I just

10152.18 --> 10157.819
if I just do even one or two children

10155.18 --> 10160.52
and and and they'd get hurt because of

10157.819 --> 10162.019999999999
some [ __ ] system I turn into a Savage

10160.52 --> 10164.54
murderer

10162.02 --> 10167.24
like I will

10164.54 --> 10169.819000000001
like I will not have my child children

10167.24 --> 10171.979
damaged

10169.819 --> 10174.019999999999
like that I will not have it happen and

10171.979 --> 10176.96
if somebody tries I will [ __ ]

10174.02 --> 10178.76
slaughter them like the whole room will

10176.96 --> 10181.64
be covered in blood

10178.76 --> 10185.42
yeah oh we have blood coming out of my

10181.64 --> 10188.08
[ __ ] nose after that

10185.42 --> 10188.08
okay

10189.26 --> 10194.300000000001
bear blood out of my nose because it's

10192.38 --> 10196.66
gonna be gushing all over the place when

10194.3 --> 10196.66
I'm done

10206.02 --> 10209.559000000001
[Music]

10211.16 --> 10215.979
how much time does one need to create 10

10213.68 --> 10215.979000000001
kids

10218.359 --> 10221.02
well

10221.899 --> 10226.819
a week two weeks

10224.96 --> 10229.279999999999
probably two weeks you're gonna need

10226.819 --> 10231.56
some travel time in between I doubt that

10229.28 --> 10233.12
they're all gonna be okay with yeah

10231.56 --> 10236.6
we're all just gonna be in this

10233.12 --> 10238.7
neighborhood each house a girlfriend I

10236.6 --> 10241.42
don't think that it will work oh who

10238.7 --> 10241.42
knows in the future

10241.7 --> 10244.42
but I don't

10245.42 --> 10251.54
either at least four well to be fair

10248.66 --> 10254.6
originally I was thinking of three

10251.54 --> 10257.300000000001
I wanted three kids

10254.6 --> 10260.78
I want an old any younger I want a

10257.3 --> 10262.938999999998
middle kid I want a young middle and an

10260.78 --> 10265.28
older kid that's how I wanted three kids

10262.939 --> 10267.62
then that's like the proper average like

10265.28 --> 10270.380000000001
if everything turns out to be that every

10267.62 --> 10272.12
stock statistic that I've ever heard my

10270.38 --> 10274.938999999998
entire [ __ ] life about population

10272.12 --> 10277.640000000001
about how the world's doing if that was

10274.939 --> 10281.720000000001
always all of it wrong and if I have

10277.64 --> 10284.3
three kids then at least I'm like having

10281.72 --> 10286.779999999999
the average population stabilizing

10284.3 --> 10286.779999999999
influence

10288.26 --> 10295.359
right so three three is like

10292.64 --> 10295.358999999999
normal

10299.359 --> 10304.18
three moms so what the timer well

10304.7 --> 10312.439
it's called polygamy Tarot

10308.66 --> 10315.14
I'm not gonna have like three moms after

10312.439 --> 10317.720000000001
like oh I'm gonna marry this girl for 10

10315.14 --> 10321.08
years have kids and then what leave them

10317.72 --> 10321.858999999999
and another girl for a Net 10 kids there

10321.08 --> 10323.72
now

10321.859 --> 10326.12
no

10323.72 --> 10327.858999999999
by that time I'll be like yeah we need

10326.12 --> 10330.319000000001
to

10327.859 --> 10333.939
I'm here to repopulate the Netherlands

10330.319 --> 10333.939
I'm here to help out

10341.12 --> 10349.899000000001
new baby every three months Jesus

10345.62 --> 10349.899000000001
well that's a bit quick there Jared

10349.939 --> 10356.18
I mean I'd give them some time in

10352.819 --> 10358.539999999999
between not just immediately one after

10356.18 --> 10358.54
another

10365.0 --> 10371.26
you could go for twin that's okay this

10367.76 --> 10371.26
is all getting really ridiculous

10372.68 --> 10377.06
three moms would take three years to get

10374.96 --> 10379.399
ten kids right

10377.06 --> 10380.359
that's a lot of that yeah no sure for

10379.399 --> 10382.039999999999
sure

10380.359 --> 10383.66
but uh

10382.04 --> 10386.779
I mean

10383.66 --> 10388.88
guys this is just like

10386.779 --> 10390.68
an idea man like I don't even know

10388.88 --> 10392.38
what's going to be left of me mentally

10390.68 --> 10395.84
after

10392.38 --> 10397.759999999998
this [ __ ] phase is over

10395.84 --> 10399.8
after the New World Order actually

10397.76 --> 10403.66
crumbles I don't know if there's any

10399.8 --> 10403.66
gonna be anything left of me

10408.979 --> 10413.24
maybe it could be that it's like I'm

10411.56 --> 10415.64
gonna have another response and that is

10413.24 --> 10418.58
ah I can finally just die and rest in

10415.64 --> 10421.099999999999
peace it could be that too guys

10418.58 --> 10423.76
I don't know I don't know what's how

10421.1 --> 10423.76
this will end

10426.68 --> 10431.84
I just know that I've kind of always

10429.56 --> 10436.34
wanted kids

10431.84 --> 10439.22
but in my 20s especially I just

10436.34 --> 10441.439
I didn't feel like I was good enough

10439.22 --> 10443.3
to be a dad I felt like you know you're

10441.439 --> 10445.58
still a teenager there's no way you

10443.3 --> 10447.319
could do a good job right now you don't

10445.58 --> 10450.7
have your right priorities I knew I

10447.319 --> 10450.699999999999
didn't have my priorities straight

10458.54 --> 10463.76
how economical is this I don't know Tara

10461.42 --> 10464.960000000001
it all depends on like how everything

10463.76 --> 10467.72
works

10464.96 --> 10471.14
I mean if there's food available

10467.72 --> 10473.179999999998
right then it could work

10471.14 --> 10475.278999999999
the only thing you really need for all

10473.18 --> 10477.979000000001
that is just food

10475.279 --> 10481.34
well if we get

10477.979 --> 10484.399
if we succeed here in restoring

10481.34 --> 10486.8
farming getting the wef out of here and

10484.399 --> 10489.858999999999
then like even like have tax reduction

10486.8 --> 10491.479
for for dude I do that like you make me

10489.859 --> 10493.939
prime minister of the Netherlands and

10491.479 --> 10497.42
I'll literally like

10493.939 --> 10502.34
I will reduce all taxation on any form

10497.42 --> 10506.18
of organic farming to zero zero taxation

10502.34 --> 10507.68
permanent whether it's small or big

10506.18 --> 10510.800000000001
yeah

10507.68 --> 10514.6
that's gonna provide enough food

10510.8 --> 10514.599999999999
for us a little baby boom

10514.939 --> 10519.26
yeah just stimulate food sources it's

10517.46 --> 10522.319
all going to be local like even if the

10519.26 --> 10524.359
entire world is in total Mayhem and War

10522.319 --> 10527.56
we could have the food production we

10524.359 --> 10527.56
could have a little baby room

10532.7 --> 10535.240000000002
right

10564.02 --> 10569.42
it's expected yeah but that's the point

10566.359 --> 10573.319
there it if I base all about numbers or

10569.42 --> 10575.779
on how the situation is now the price is

10573.319 --> 10578.42
now it's going to be blatantly obvious

10575.779 --> 10579.800000000001
that's not doable

10578.42 --> 10583.22
again

10579.8 --> 10586.22
things transition like the situation

10583.22 --> 10589.58
really flips around and farming is

10586.22 --> 10592.76
completely restored and made cheaper

10589.58 --> 10594.5
then that changes everything and I mean

10592.76 --> 10598.16
everything

10594.5 --> 10600.319
it changes the average Riches of every

10598.16 --> 10601.819
citizen

10600.319 --> 10603.859
they're certainly more food available

10601.819 --> 10606.619999999999
and it's cheaper

10603.859 --> 10608.960000000001
it changes everything so it's pointless

10606.62 --> 10611.060000000001
to start estimating what it's going to

10608.96 --> 10613.88
cost based on what's going on now it's

10611.06 --> 10617.0
completely pointless

10613.88 --> 10619.938999999998
there isn't anything you can do with the

10617.0 --> 10622.1
way it works now it's all way too

10619.939 --> 10624.14
[ __ ] expensive

10622.1 --> 10625.640000000001
you're gonna run into real serious

10624.14 --> 10627.74
trouble

10625.64 --> 10629.84
and they're probably gonna try to make

10627.74 --> 10632.92
you sell your kid to them

10629.84 --> 10632.92
I'm not even joking

10636.74 --> 10641.42
yeah they already do it with third world

10638.899 --> 10643.519999999999
country people make them sell their

10641.42 --> 10645.979
children to them and you don't want to

10643.52 --> 10648.560000000001
know how they end up

10645.979 --> 10651.679999999998
but they will want to try that with

10648.56 --> 10654.38
Europeans too but to do that they need

10651.68 --> 10657.2
to be just as poor

10654.38 --> 10658.759999999998
as third world country people

10657.2 --> 10661.300000000001
and that's what they're trying to do

10658.76 --> 10661.300000000001
right now

10662.779 --> 10667.16
yeah

10663.979 --> 10669.5
they're making us poor not so we don't

10667.16 --> 10673.1
overthrow them no they're making us poor

10669.5 --> 10676.88
so they can use us as cattle as in

10673.1 --> 10681.26
literally harvesting our meat

10676.88 --> 10685.3
our children and all of it

10681.26 --> 10685.300000000001
that's why they're doing it

10687.859 --> 10694.640000000001
they're caging you in for literal

10691.58 --> 10697.3
physical Slaughter

10694.64 --> 10697.3
you understand

10702.56 --> 10707.0
it's not just oh we just want them poor

10705.14 --> 10710.899
so they can't overthrow us no no no no

10707.0 --> 10715.819
no they they have more plans than that

10710.899 --> 10719.358999999999
yeah it's not just about keeping power

10715.819 --> 10721.1
now they have a plan for people

10719.359 --> 10724.640000000001

Serpent's ways

10755.54 --> 10761.54
that kind of happens there yeah that's

10758.72 --> 10764.599999999999
what they want it's Neo feudalism that's

10761.54 --> 10767.779
what used to happen the Nobles go around

10764.6 --> 10769.640000000001
and they just take children from their

10767.779 --> 10771.859
peasants

10769.64 --> 10774.019999999999
yeah yeah that's the part you don't

10771.859 --> 10777.62
really hear about too much because it's

10774.02 --> 10780.2
not looked upon as nostalgically

10777.62 --> 10782.060000000001
huh

10780.2 --> 10784.04
that's what they want

10782.06 --> 10788.42
you poor

10784.04 --> 10793.939
so that they can Harvest you

10788.42 --> 10797.68
they can just buy your children off you

10793.939 --> 10801.979000000001
because you can't afford to even survive

10797.68 --> 10804.5
not taking those deals yeah that's the

10801.979 --> 10806.66
future they're building on oh you

10804.5 --> 10809.479
thought oh it's just poor now it's not

10806.66 --> 10812.38
just poor no it's poor for Pure

10809.479 --> 10812.38
exploitation

10815.779 --> 10819.5
yeah

10817.58 --> 10822.439
and in the process during that

10819.5 --> 10825.08
exploitation you could like gradually

10822.439 --> 10828.380000000001
demoralize everybody so they just kill

10825.08 --> 10830.66
they kill themselves they die diseased

10828.38 --> 10831.92
because they can't handle any of it and

10830.66 --> 10833.84
they don't get the right nutrients

10831.92 --> 10836.479
anymore and like that's how they're

10833.84 --> 10838.76
gonna exterminate you yeah not like oh

10836.479 --> 10840.699999999999
you're just poor oh and then one day

10838.76 --> 10845.12
come by and shoot you no no no

10840.7 --> 10846.319000000001
they'll make you sell your children to

10845.12 --> 10849.859
them

10846.319 --> 10854.14
with deals you can't resist

10849.859 --> 10857.359
and they'll make you torture yourself

10854.14 --> 10859.278999999999
over all that and kill yourself that's

10857.359 --> 10861.2
how they want to do it they don't want

10859.279 --> 10866.439
just a clean death they want you

10861.2 --> 10866.439
miserable and in hell when you're done

10887.54 --> 10892.819000000001
it's a cattle Industries like how can

10890.3 --> 10895.64
you get them killed and still get some

10892.819 --> 10899.96
profit for it right I mean they weren't

10895.64 --> 10903.22
just gonna kill off the overpopulation

10899.96 --> 10906.38
not if they couldn't profit from it yeah

10903.22 --> 10909.619999999999
because just killing a bunch of things

10906.38 --> 10912.5
is not profitable it's only profitable

10909.62 --> 10914.779
when you can do something profitable in

10912.5 --> 10916.88
the process and these are these

10914.779 --> 10919.279
profitable factors

10916.88 --> 10921.438999999998

everybody yeah

10932.66 --> 10937.1
that's what they want and that's

10935.24 --> 10941.08
going to happen

10937.1 --> 10941.08
unless we kill them all

10952.52 --> 10957.26
because they're gonna keep doing it yeah

10954.68 --> 10958.939
all the old politicians oh we got a

10957.26 --> 10959.960000000001
couple hundred thousand people killed

10958.939 --> 10962.66
well

10959.96 --> 10965.66
they'll just resign and move to another

10962.66 --> 10966.619999999999
country U.N stronghold and then oh yeah

10965.66 --> 10969.02
we'll

10966.62 --> 10971.660000000002

again and more people are gonna die

10980.359 --> 10984.859
because oh guess what oh and then he's

10982.64 --> 10986.84
gonna retire now he's gonna go to a un

10984.859 --> 10988.460000000001
stronghold and then there's nothing

10986.84 --> 10991.18
you're gonna do about it either and it

10988.46 --> 10993.519999999999
just keeps happening and happening until

in 97

the U.N was evil in nature

and on his side

11263.56 --> 11269.979

of documentation already public

now happening like thousand times more

11306.46 --> 11310.72
than it used to

11308.439 --> 11314.62
it's because they literally just made

it's because of the humanity that they

keep coming yeah that's exactly why they

11417.22 --> 11421.96
keep coming you know when it stops when

you start Machining machine gunning them

nah

11521.319 --> 11526.899

11523.779 --> 11529.66
the point is it should just be

11526.899 --> 11531.88
have no influence it's like oh whining

11529.66 --> 11533.8
about yeah that's cool and nobody gives

a [ __ ] whine about it write about it

11533.8 --> 11537.58
some whine about it for a couple of

11537.58 --> 11542.56
like it shouldn't matter how much they

whine about it

11542.56 --> 11548.26
you're just not gonna change policy that

should be the way it works

11548.26 --> 11552.52
like yeah you know we're gonna secure

11550.899 --> 11555.58
this border now we're gonna do it like

11552.52 --> 11559.380000000001
this and it doesn't matter what any

11555.58 --> 11559.38
[ __ ] person says about it

11559.84 --> 11563.380000000001

not having any impact with doing that

want to whine all day

11571.479 --> 11575.679999999998
a lot of these liberal whiners they do

11573.76 --> 11578.26
it because they think that they are

11575.68 --> 11579.460000000001
actually achieving something with doing

11578.26 --> 11582.58
it because

11579.46 --> 11586.979
government wants them to do it to use

11582.58 --> 11586.979
that as an excuse to do their things

11587.14 --> 11591.16
and they're playing into that but if the

government doesn't play into that then

11591.16 --> 11595.479
they'll stop whining

11593.14 --> 11596.819
yeah they're only whining because this

11595.479 --> 11600.64
[ __ ] up

11596.819 --> 11604.72
liberal government is literally using

11600.64 --> 11608.22
their whining to progress their agenda

nothing but hamsters on a wheel

11618.939 --> 11625.5
running in the hamster wheel

11622.6 --> 11625.5
that simple

who gives a [ __ ] that the borders were

closed

through the borders

11659.439 --> 11663.7
legally

11660.88 --> 11666.42
yeah that's the difference

11663.7 --> 11666.42
legally

11667.0 --> 11672.46
yeah it takes a little bit more time

11668.979 --> 11675.58
then but I mean it's not like oh nobody

11672.46 --> 11677.259999999998
ever comes in or out ever again like

11675.58 --> 11679.3
what

11677.26 --> 11681.399
let's say I'm telling you to build like

11679.3 --> 11684.759999999998
a Chinese wall around the United States

11681.399 --> 11688.42
that's a bit Overkill I mean it's just

11684.76 --> 11690.7
that prevent the the people from just

11688.42 --> 11693.939
illegally running in

11690.7 --> 11695.800000000001
that's it that's pretty much it

11693.939 --> 11697.42
doesn't mean that there's no more

11695.8 --> 11701.039999999999
immigration ever

11697.42 --> 11701.04
that's kind of excessive

11704.56 --> 11708.88
right just

11706.0 --> 11712.779
that machine gun turrets at the typical

11708.88 --> 11715.66
illegal cross points Crossing points

11712.779 --> 11718.300000000001
just like have legal immigration points

11715.66 --> 11719.74
where people can check in and show their

11718.3 --> 11722.438999999998
passport

11719.74 --> 11723.76
and have background checks done on them

11722.439 --> 11726.939
and then

11723.76 --> 11728.26
they can come in or go out

11726.939 --> 11731.52
yeah

11728.26 --> 11731.52
they don't have to be shot

11733.12 --> 11739.62
it's called actual border security an

11736.479 --> 11739.619999999999
effective sort

11745.24 --> 11748.5
all the way through

11748.779 --> 11753.34
you know

11750.64 --> 11755.439
yeah well if you have good enough

11753.34 --> 11757.18
machine gun turrets they'll just shoot

11755.439 --> 11759.66
on the other side where they come out of

11757.18 --> 11759.66
the hole then

11763.359 --> 11770.319
besides a good wall is not just sitting

11766.96 --> 11775.119999999999
on the sand it goes very [ __ ] deep

11770.319 --> 11778.778999999999
you can't dig around it or underneath it

11775.12 --> 11781.479000000001
that only works with like basic barbed

11778.779 --> 11783.399000000001
wire fences and [ __ ] yeah not an

11781.479 --> 11787.42
actual one actual wall goes deep into

11783.399 --> 11790.439
the ground you can't dig underneath it

11787.42 --> 11790.439
not a real wall

11804.88 --> 11808.979
right anyway I am rounding out the show

11809.8 --> 11814.24
thanks everyone for coming

11812.08 --> 11816.58
I hope you like this show it got a bit

11814.24 --> 11819.039999999999
dark at the end

11816.58 --> 11821.52
but I mean yeah it's just how I feel

11819.04 --> 11821.52
about it

11827.26 --> 11833.2
can they just pay off work I don't know

11831.04 --> 11834.939
I'm not gonna get further into that I

11833.2 --> 11838.060000000001
mean I think that just proper machine

11834.939 --> 11839.859
gun turrets and just having a [ __ ] them

11838.06 --> 11841.84
policy like

11839.859 --> 11844.84
it's like oh no we have to save the good

11841.84 --> 11846.399
no no you literally shoot everybody that

11844.84 --> 11849.279
tries to do that it's just everybody

11846.399 --> 11851.74
just doesn't matter what comes of it it

11849.279 --> 11854.5
dies

11851.74 --> 11857.38
so that it becomes very well known if

11854.5 --> 11860.62
you try to do that you die

11857.38 --> 11861.64
yeah if that happens it's gonna stop

11860.62 --> 11864.220000000001
yeah

11861.64 --> 11866.319
the hundreds of thousands flowing in

11864.22 --> 11869.199999999999
that's gonna stop when they find out

11866.319 --> 11872.8
that they all die that they get machine

11869.2 --> 11874.84
gunned down like in World War One when

11872.8 --> 11879.3
they start to find that out it's gonna

11874.84 --> 11879.3
stop yeah it's that simple

11880.6 --> 11883.54
right

11882.279 --> 11886.12
