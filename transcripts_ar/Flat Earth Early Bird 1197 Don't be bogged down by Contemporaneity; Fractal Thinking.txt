amazing

110.399 --> 117.04
it's probably the clearest day

112.88 --> 117.03999999999999
in the la yeah in these last few weeks

118.56 --> 123.04
it's super clear even like at the

121.04 --> 125.68
horizon

123.04 --> 129.84
no trails being left whatsoever despite

125.68 --> 129.84
there being plenty of planes up there

130.64 --> 132.95899999999997
and

133.04 --> 136.07999999999998
yeah

135.2 --> 138.07999999999998
very

136.08 --> 140.84
very little wind as well

138.08 --> 143.28
so it's just seems like this

140.84 --> 145.44
astonishing sunny

143.28 --> 147.68
spring day

145.44 --> 150.07999999999998
it's like almost summer but it's just

147.68 --> 154.0
not hot enough to actually be summer yet

150.08 --> 154.0
but it damn well looks like

154.84 --> 158.8
summer really beautiful

167.92 --> 171.83999999999997
yay my camera didn't freeze

175.68 --> 179.519
hello jeff gassad first in chat

178.159 --> 182.92
good to see you

179.519 --> 182.92000000000002
how are you doing

184.239 --> 187.68
bill nye the science denier

187.84 --> 195.879
it is

190.0 --> 195.879
sunday the 27th of march 2022

196.84 --> 203.28
and yeah

199.68 --> 205.59900000000002
i think that the uh the time now changed

203.28 --> 208.319
here in europe

205.599 --> 210.64
as yeah

208.319 --> 212.72
the times were suddenly off it's like oh

210.64 --> 215.83999999999997
my alarm clock from my phone is just the

212.72 --> 217.28
same time it's not like i don't allow it

215.84 --> 219.04
to auto

217.28 --> 220.159
set because it's going to mess that up

219.04 --> 222.48
in the past

220.159 --> 224.239
so always do that manually but i noticed

222.48 --> 227.23899999999998
like hey wait it's an hour later

224.239 --> 227.239
everywhere

227.92 --> 233.51899999999998
so yeah i think that the time's now set

230.319 --> 233.51899999999998
back here in europe as well

233.68 --> 236.64000000000001
so

234.879 --> 238.0
should be more synchronized now with the

236.64 --> 239.27999999999997
us

238.0 --> 243.28
again

239.28 --> 243.28
hello terrett 306.

267.12 --> 272.479
right i got another gusto energy drink

269.759 --> 272.47900000000004
i'm just

272.88 --> 276.479
really liking these recently

277.919 --> 283.84
but yeah since it does cost some

280.88 --> 283.84
i'm trying to

283.919 --> 286.88
rearrange my

287.52 --> 290.56
my diet a little

291.28 --> 296.4
so i'm not eating pizzas anymore which

293.6 --> 299.04
worked great during the winter i'm just

296.4 --> 301.52
gonna go back to

299.04 --> 303.44
baked eggs

301.52 --> 306.24
and yeah it's springtime so it only

303.44 --> 308.24
makes sense it's cheaper again

306.24 --> 310.639
it's more nourishing than it was at

308.24 --> 313.12
times during the winter

310.639 --> 315.12
and that way yeah pizzas work a little

313.12 --> 316.16
expensive you know

315.12 --> 318.72
like not

316.16 --> 321.36
like insanely expensive it is a full

318.72 --> 321.36
meal but

322.84 --> 329.19899999999996
yeah that way it just works out and i

325.6 --> 330.72
can have a couple of gusto energy drinks

329.199 --> 332.88
or like one

330.72 --> 335.03900000000004
during the show

332.88 --> 338.36
hello nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

335.039 --> 338.36
how are you doing

342.56 --> 348.08
yeah i've got it

344.88 --> 350.0
pretty tight financially

348.08 --> 351.039
so yeah

350.0 --> 355.039
but

351.039 --> 355.039
it's gonna work the way it always does

358.639 --> 364.319
and yeah most of the time

361.6 --> 367.8
you guys do like kind of pull through

364.319 --> 367.8
for me financially

368.0 --> 372.08
although it's usually like right at the

369.759 --> 374.88
last moment when everything

372.08 --> 379.039
seems to be going to fall apart

374.88 --> 382.56
if it wouldn't so but yeah that's fine

379.039 --> 382.56
okay okay good to know

383.919 --> 388.639
how's the ribs is it is it like healing

386.24 --> 388.639
up yet

388.8 --> 393.40000000000003
might take a while though you know

398.8 --> 405.16

400.8 --> 405.16
speakers coming nathan oakley

420.88 --> 424.8

430.639 --> 435.68
hilarious

432.319 --> 436.88
little deep fake skit about nancy pelosi

this time

442.8 --> 445.44
hilarious

448.84 --> 452.919

471.36 --> 473.84000000000003
right now

474.4 --> 477.52
i feel like taking it easy which is good

476.4 --> 480.23999999999995
because

477.52 --> 482.639
this morning i feel like really restless

480.24 --> 484.639
overall

482.639 --> 486.56
kind of like dissatisfied with my

484.639 --> 488.479
situation and

486.56 --> 490.4
cranky

488.479 --> 493.12
sent you five bucks

490.4 --> 496.15999999999997
all right i appreciate that thank you

493.12 --> 498.479
like even five bucks or something

496.16 --> 498.47900000000004
you know

504.16 --> 508.24
but

505.039 --> 510.87899999999996
did the gofundme work out so far or you

508.24 --> 513.84
like halfway or like uh what give you

510.879 --> 513.84
give us an update

518.88 --> 522.24
and thank you for the paypal

527.36 --> 530.36
hmm

550.0 --> 555.2
you don't know till you get a quote

552.88 --> 555.2
what

560.399 --> 565.36
oh okay

563.04 --> 566.24
oh you mean you haven't actually gotten

565.36 --> 568.32
like

566.24 --> 569.92
the cost

568.32 --> 572.88
they haven't sized up the price for

569.92 --> 575.88
repair yet right right

572.88 --> 575.88
okay

588.88 --> 592.24
well

589.76 --> 593.12
what would it cost to like replace it

592.24 --> 594.88
new

593.12 --> 596.16
you know that's always a good kind of

594.88 --> 599.8
standard to

596.16 --> 599.8
compare it with

628.64 --> 632.56
oh 10 000

630.48 --> 633.519
jesus

632.56 --> 635.68
for

633.519 --> 638.079
what

635.68 --> 640.16
wow okay so you've got like the most

638.079 --> 642.399
expensive freaking speakers in the world

640.16 --> 645.4399999999999
well not technic i know they go like to

642.399 --> 647.2
insane pride but that's like pretty damn

645.44 --> 649.36
expensive man

647.2 --> 650.48
sheesh

649.36 --> 654.24
i mean

650.48 --> 656.399
my speakers cost like 80 euros

654.24 --> 658.8
they're great though but good enough for

656.399 --> 661.44
me i know it's probably not good enough

658.8 --> 662.959
for you with your sound room and all

661.44 --> 665.9590000000001
that but

662.959 --> 665.959
man

694.0 --> 697.0
hmm

710.24 --> 713.399
all right

722.0 --> 727.279
dude

723.76 --> 729.279
this is just way out of my range

727.279 --> 731.76
i mean

729.279 --> 735.2
i don't have to remind you of like

731.76 --> 736.639
things being overpriced in sound land

735.2 --> 738.8000000000001
and all that

736.639 --> 741.6800000000001
so i i take it you know

738.8 --> 744.399
to actually get something that's that is

741.68 --> 748.5999999999999
really worth it

744.399 --> 748.6
right but damn

765.12 --> 770.079
oh it's the latest version

767.279 --> 770.079
okay okay

770.48 --> 773.839
hey canada bear

790.0 --> 793.0
1999

793.36 --> 797.88
and what did they cost back then

801.12 --> 805.44
or did you get them like in a super deal

803.92 --> 808.399
like they were gonna put them away or

805.44 --> 810.48
something and you got it i mean

808.399 --> 812.079
that's how i would get those kinds of

810.48 --> 815.44
things

812.079 --> 819.8389999999999
like i'm not gonna pay for something new

815.44 --> 819.839
paid 800 pounds right right

821.839 --> 827.639
yeah that that makes sense all right all

824.639 --> 827.639
right

830.8 --> 836.56
still freaking expensive for a bunch for

832.959 --> 836.56
a speaker but yeah that's

839.68 --> 843.519
that's a factor

841.279 --> 846.519
better in the in a better direction

843.519 --> 846.519
anyway

856.079 --> 861.5999999999999
i was thinking but it feels silly like

858.88 --> 863.519
maybe i want to do a gofundme for new

861.6 --> 866.5600000000001
shoes

863.519 --> 868.8
which i would set at 100 euros

866.56 --> 871.3599999999999
it like it would probably cost me like

868.8 --> 874.7199999999999
80.

871.36 --> 876.88
i think unless like there was some price

874.72 --> 879.12
going up might be

876.88 --> 882.32
last time even bought it like at the guy

879.12 --> 882.32
always get my shoes

882.399 --> 886.56
like that was already like 10 years ago

886.639 --> 889.6
or more

888.0 --> 891.519
i don't even remember when's the last

889.6 --> 892.5600000000001
time i went there i hope he's still

891.519 --> 895.6
there

892.56 --> 897.8389999999999
but yeah then with like a hundred euros

895.6 --> 900.16
i would be able to cover like the the

897.839 --> 902.48
travel cost to get there through the

900.16 --> 902.48
train

903.279 --> 908.56
and then actually get those shoes

905.12 --> 911.6
because like my shoes are so freaking

908.56 --> 914.4799999999999
warm it's it's not funny anymore it's

911.6 --> 916.16
literally not funny anymore

914.48 --> 918.8000000000001
they're constantly

916.16 --> 921.199
dude i can

918.8 --> 923.12
i can literally look right through my

921.199 --> 927.3599999999999
shoe right now

923.12 --> 929.92
let me try to share that right

927.36 --> 933.36
oh look at arwen he's so poor you can

929.92 --> 935.759
literally look right through my shoe

933.36 --> 938.0790000000001
i can see my webcam through my shoe

935.759 --> 942.399
right now

938.079 --> 944.4799999999999
right yeah i think yeah you can see so

942.399 --> 947.519
and like every part of the letter is

944.48 --> 948.639
worn out i've glued this thing

947.519 --> 950.639
the sole

948.639 --> 956.399
like back together

950.639 --> 958.72
at least like 10 times by now and

956.399 --> 962.24
it just starting to look like at some

958.72 --> 966.0
point it's just not gonna stick anymore

962.24 --> 968.0
i still actually use these shoes though

966.0 --> 970.399
i think you and that's the cool thing

968.0 --> 972.88
about these types of shoes they last

970.399 --> 975.68
incredibly long

972.88 --> 978.0
but yeah after

975.68 --> 981.279
i don't know

978.0 --> 983.92
10 years maybe more of pretty much

981.279 --> 986.8
wearing them every day

983.92 --> 989.68
they yeah eventually it just breaks up

986.8 --> 989.68
it breaks apart

992.32 --> 995.839
so

993.519 --> 997.839
i was thinking maybe maybe that's the

995.839 --> 1000.32
way to do it

997.839 --> 1002.5600000000001
because like i'm still

1000.32 --> 1005.44
in the need constantly for food and all

1002.56 --> 1007.8389999999999
that that's really because

1005.44 --> 1011.2790000000001
when i ask for support on my show and i

1007.839 --> 1013.6800000000001
say i needed to eat that's not actually

1011.279 --> 1016.16
like an over exaggeration that's quite

1013.68 --> 1016.16
literal

1019.12 --> 1022.9590000000001
but

1020.079 --> 1025.12
i might be cheaper to get them rea no

1022.959 --> 1027.52
this is a reason

1025.12 --> 1030.079
that's the point it's not just the souls

1027.52 --> 1032.24
the entire leather is just there's so

1030.079 --> 1037.079
many cuts in there

1032.24 --> 1037.079
it's it's not even funny anymore like

1041.52 --> 1046.72
it's pretty much everything

1043.679 --> 1048.5590000000002
above my hand here is still kind of okay

1046.72 --> 1050.72
everything underneath there is just so

1048.559 --> 1053.6789999999999
worn out

1050.72 --> 1056.16
like even the rubber over here

1053.679 --> 1058.0800000000002
that that was like half a centimeter

1056.16 --> 1061.1200000000001
originally it's just completely starting

1058.08 --> 1061.12
to wear through like

1061.2 --> 1064.25
if i'm gonna have to wear these shoes

1062.96 --> 1065.76
for two more years

1064.25 --> 1068.08
[Music]

1065.76 --> 1071.52
literally at some point like the soul is

1068.08 --> 1073.84
gonna break in two or something

1071.52 --> 1073.84
right

1076.08 --> 1083.52
what size shoe am i

1078.84 --> 1083.52
uh i think like 43

1085.12 --> 1090.1999999999998
42 and a half if that even is a thing

1096.88 --> 1101.2800000000002
you need those shoes kind of bear do you

1100.24 --> 1105.0
well they're

1101.28 --> 1105.0
london underground

1114.559 --> 1117.039
serious

1117.44 --> 1121.0
i can see

1122.64 --> 1126.64
i've been wearing like literally this

1124.64 --> 1130.039
brand of shoes for

1126.64 --> 1130.039
20 years

1140.88 --> 1144.2
hello kevlar

1166.4 --> 1172.0800000000002
your last a year if you're lucky

1169.12 --> 1174.9599999999998
well what do you do with them i mean

1172.08 --> 1176.3999999999999
i'm kind of just like an urbanite

1174.96 --> 1178.799
with

1176.4 --> 1182.64
with these shoes right if i if i'd use

1178.799 --> 1186.32
them as like working shoes on a farm

1182.64 --> 1188.72
or like i just like say heavy job like a

1186.32 --> 1190.6399999999999
steel mill or something like that right

1188.72 --> 1192.48
they'd probably you'd probably go

1190.64 --> 1194.1200000000001
through them quicker

1192.48 --> 1196.559
so it's not like they're like

1194.12 --> 1198.3999999999999
adamantium's shoes they're just really

1196.559 --> 1200.8799999999999
sturdy

1198.4 --> 1202.3200000000002
and if you don't rough them up

1200.88 --> 1204.4
constantly

1202.32 --> 1207.12
then they'll last extremely long that's

1204.4 --> 1211.039
why i chose them

1207.12 --> 1213.039
i i a lot of the times when i get things

1211.039 --> 1214.799
like i

1213.039 --> 1217.12
pick something that i know is going to

1214.799 --> 1218.48
last like half a lifetime

1217.12 --> 1221.84
specifically

1218.48 --> 1221.84
based on that factor

1222.159 --> 1226.0
i always choose durability

1226.559 --> 1231.6789999999999
because every time i haven't i've been

1228.64 --> 1234.4
sorry right and after some

1231.679 --> 1237.2800000000002
decades of living it's just like okay

1234.4 --> 1240.48
i'm not gonna do that like that anymore

1237.28 --> 1242.72
i'm just gonna go for the durability

1240.48 --> 1247.28
the more time passes the more i'm very

1242.72 --> 1247.28
glad that i even have that objective

1249.76 --> 1254.72
farming warehouse stuff right well if

1252.559 --> 1257.039
you like work in a warehouse they'd be

1254.72 --> 1260.32
great right on a farm though yeah

1257.039 --> 1264.24
they're gonna get dirty and [ __ ]

1260.32 --> 1264.24
there might be better brands for that

1270.32 --> 1275.52
right these are not like the best shoes

1272.88 --> 1276.48
in the world they're like pretty

1275.52 --> 1278.48
average

1276.48 --> 1280.48
in quality i think

1278.48 --> 1282.72
it's just they've really worked well for

1280.48 --> 1282.72
me

1287.44 --> 1291.8400000000001
no they are not cowboy boots lol

1298.0 --> 1302.799
pay more for american made products and

1300.0 --> 1305.799
ones has this failed me

1302.799 --> 1305.799
right

1310.159 --> 1312.88
i

1310.96 --> 1314.48
i have not come across

1312.88 --> 1316.72
a lot of like

1314.48 --> 1320.4
industrial american-made products i

1316.72 --> 1322.48
don't really have the any way to compare

1320.4 --> 1325.039
right the only american products i've

1322.48 --> 1328.08
really gotten so far have been through

1325.039 --> 1330.24
infor store.com

1328.08 --> 1332.24
food supplements that were made in

1330.24 --> 1334.48
america

1332.24 --> 1335.679
and other than that

1334.48 --> 1338.32
no

1335.679 --> 1338.3200000000002
not really

1344.88 --> 1350.96
unless you include like magic cards but

1348.08 --> 1350.96
yeah that's no

1351.36 --> 1355.1999999999998
i don't even know if they're like

1352.799 --> 1356.96
physically printed out in america or if

1355.2 --> 1358.799
they do that in like south korea or

1356.96 --> 1360.96
something i have no idea

1358.799 --> 1363.36
but

1360.96 --> 1366.159
can i send you some boots

1363.36 --> 1366.1589999999999
they are brown

1367.039 --> 1372.0
i do very much appreciate the gesture

1369.679 --> 1372.0
but

1372.48 --> 1377.6
i'm not a big fan of brown boots

1376.799 --> 1380.6399999999999
that

1377.6 --> 1380.6399999999999
sounds kind of like

1380.72 --> 1385.2
yeah it's just i mean they got to be

1382.799 --> 1385.2
black

1387.28 --> 1393.039
unless they're like real

1390.799 --> 1396.32
designated working shoes or something i

1393.039 --> 1398.96
guess i could use those sure

1396.32 --> 1401.9189999999999
but for my general attire

1398.96 --> 1404.32
i really want like i just want these

1401.919 --> 1406.88
types of black boots you know i know how

1404.32 --> 1406.8799999999999
they work

1407.44 --> 1414.1200000000001
i feel really at

1409.44 --> 1414.1200000000001
ease with those types of boots

1421.2 --> 1425.76
but yeah sure guys yeah you can

1423.679 --> 1428.3200000000002
technically just send me things over the

1425.76 --> 1431.279
mail that is if you actually want to do

1428.32 --> 1433.2
that you can

1431.279 --> 1436.08
just realize if you're going to send

1433.2 --> 1439.279
things across the pond

1436.08 --> 1440.32
it might also like include a

1439.279 --> 1442.64
like

1440.32 --> 1444.96
an extra bill it usually does when you

1442.64 --> 1448.0800000000002
order things from infowars store

1444.96 --> 1448.08
it's just like there's the

1450.799 --> 1456.08
there's like customs fees

1453.36 --> 1458.6399999999999
like even if it's just the thing they're

1456.08 --> 1460.799
just ending

1458.64 --> 1460.7990000000002
so

1461.76 --> 1466.6
slightly used what

1482.64 --> 1486.0
well

1484.4 --> 1489.1200000000001
after

1486.0 --> 1489.12
second yeah

1492.0 --> 1497.2
i don't make a habit of like getting

1494.159 --> 1497.2
second hand boots

1498.48 --> 1501.84
i mean if things get

1504.08 --> 1510.6399999999999
financially bad enough out here then i

1506.72 --> 1510.64
guess that i will at that point but

1512.48 --> 1517.6
i'm like very happy with like my the the

1515.44 --> 1520.72
condition of my feet

1517.6 --> 1524.24
so i i don't typically like the idea of

1520.72 --> 1527.799
wearing secondhand boots

1524.24 --> 1527.799
if you don't mind

1536.72 --> 1542.08
power tools look like plastic lego stuff

1539.44 --> 1544.24
yeah that's over here as well kind of

1542.08 --> 1547.6789999999999
very i think it's probably worse in the

1544.24 --> 1551.1200000000001
us but yeah a lot of products in bigger

1547.679 --> 1554.4
stores over here are also

1551.12 --> 1554.3999999999999
made in china or

1555.12 --> 1561.08
although there's still a lot of made in

1556.96 --> 1561.08
germany products as well

1576.88 --> 1580.4
don't buy cheap chinese tools

1579.44 --> 1583.799
no

1580.4 --> 1583.799
no i wouldn't

1586.559 --> 1591.6789999999999
i mean if i'm gonna like get equipment

1589.039 --> 1593.679
to build

1591.679 --> 1596.4
you know maintenance equipment i

1593.679 --> 1599.1200000000001
typically choose more german brands

1596.4 --> 1601.76
they've just worked out a lot better

1599.12 --> 1601.76
on average

1604.24 --> 1608.32
they use better

1606.0 --> 1611.32
plastic qualities they don't break

1608.32 --> 1611.32
unexpectedly

1613.279 --> 1616.279
etc

1626.24 --> 1629.919
right but anyway i was just thinking

1628.32 --> 1633.039
about that

1629.919 --> 1636.96
i don't know if you guys are like

1633.039 --> 1639.44
are going to be like yeah do it darwin

1636.96 --> 1643.76
have like a sort of gofundme for new

1639.44 --> 1643.76
shoes because i can damn well use it

1651.679 --> 1656.0
for me it's not even because they look

1654.0 --> 1656.799
so trashy right

1656.0 --> 1658.08
for

1656.799 --> 1660.399
what

1658.08 --> 1663.1999999999998
the condition those shoes are actually

1660.399 --> 1665.6
in they still look fine i mean they look

1663.2 --> 1667.8400000000001
a little rugged right

1665.6 --> 1670.6399999999999
that's no prob they look

1667.84 --> 1672.559
better than they're actually

1670.64 --> 1675.44
like what the real condition is because

1672.559 --> 1677.84
when i wear them i like feel

1675.44 --> 1680.72
like ah it's so like it's like getting

1677.84 --> 1683.4399999999998
uneven and [ __ ] and it's just they're

1680.72 --> 1686.08
kind of a mess at this point but they

1683.44 --> 1689.6000000000001
still look pretty good for

1686.08 --> 1689.6
the actual condition they're in

1690.159 --> 1696.48
but yeah i do really want new shoes

1693.679 --> 1699.6000000000001
been wanting it for a while

1696.48 --> 1702.159
and now i'm coming out for it

1699.6 --> 1705.12
and to accomplish all that i'd like need

1702.159 --> 1705.1200000000001
a hundred euros

1705.679 --> 1708.3200000000002
separately

1708.72 --> 1713.919
from yeah the support i need for food

1711.36 --> 1713.9189999999999
and all that

1714.88 --> 1718.96
right but no hurry it's just an idea

1721.6 --> 1726.48
i mean i can technically still wear them

1724.24 --> 1730.32
for another two years before they

1726.48 --> 1730.32
literally break into when all that

1731.6 --> 1735.6
hopefully two years not

1733.76 --> 1738.1589999999999
less

1735.6 --> 1740.32
hey elise g that flat fellow good see

1738.159 --> 1740.3200000000002
you

1741.279 --> 1745.159
george sanford also

1764.64 --> 1767.6000000000001
right so anything you guys want to talk

1766.72 --> 1770.08
about

1767.6 --> 1772.559
i'm i'm pretty focused i got pretty much

1770.08 --> 1774.96
the entire day

1772.559 --> 1774.96
you know

1775.679 --> 1780.8400000000001
i might do a long stream as well like i

1777.6 --> 1780.84
did yesterday

1784.0 --> 1791.6
there is a lot to talk about

1787.44 --> 1794.3990000000001
like i am pretty much spinning

1791.6 --> 1796.9599999999998
in my mind in the evening

1794.399 --> 1798.6399999999999
like the last few

1796.96 --> 1800.64
last week

1798.64 --> 1802.159
because there's just a lot going on

1800.64 --> 1804.48
there's a lot happening it's just that

1802.159 --> 1805.679
typically when you start the show i kind

1804.48 --> 1808.559
of like

1805.679 --> 1810.88
forget about that it's just like

1808.559 --> 1813.6
i retract and then i focus really on

1810.88 --> 1815.7600000000002
this moment then it takes a while before

1813.6 --> 1817.6
i get a grasp back

1815.76 --> 1818.72
oh you you guys are probably used to

1817.6 --> 1822.9189999999999
that

1818.72 --> 1822.919
those that have been watching regularly

1833.679 --> 1838.48
slightly used boots waterproof up to the

1836.64 --> 1840.64
ankle okay cool

1838.48 --> 1844.48
well so are these types of shoes if they

1840.64 --> 1844.48
didn't have holes in them everywhere

1862.08 --> 1866.0
play money plastic tools holes and boots

1864.399 --> 1868.08
we are well on their way to colonizing

1866.0 --> 1870.32
mars lol

1868.08 --> 1873.72
that's hilarious

1870.32 --> 1873.72
the other andrew

1904.32 --> 1910.08
you hear that guys

1906.64 --> 1910.0800000000002
i mean did the mic pic

1912.32 --> 1918.76
it's doing it again

1914.559 --> 1918.76
like could you hear that

1921.519 --> 1927.679
it it's like it sounds like

1925.2 --> 1930.0800000000002
like the closet was like stretching like

1927.679 --> 1931.76
i would it literally sounds like that's

1930.08 --> 1935.72
so weird

1931.76 --> 1935.72
just does that out of nowhere

1958.0 --> 1962.84
so did you guys hear that or didn't you

1976.559 --> 1979.559
hello

1993.84 --> 1998.1999999999998
you didn't hear it okay

2005.679 --> 2011.039
you missed it whatever no you didn't

2007.84 --> 2014.72
hear that at all damn it

2011.039 --> 2014.72
to me it's like loud as [ __ ]

2016.24 --> 2019.6
it's basically sounding like let me

2018.559 --> 2022.24
check

2019.6 --> 2026.76
you guys could hear this

2022.24 --> 2026.76
just look at the bar of my mic

2032.72 --> 2037.519
right i can literally see it move when i

2035.2 --> 2038.799
did that so it should have picked that

2037.519 --> 2041.84
up

2038.799 --> 2044.0
because it was that that sound level

2041.84 --> 2044.0
just

2044.72 --> 2047.72
oh

2049.76 --> 2053.28
you're chewing with headphones yeah that

2051.599 --> 2055.52
doesn't help

2053.28 --> 2058.48
right

2055.52 --> 2061.359
snakes in the walls no

2058.48 --> 2062.32
it's just that that closet has a

2061.359 --> 2066.56
weird

2062.32 --> 2069.52
imbued spirit it has had that for like

2066.56 --> 2072.32
30 years i think

2069.52 --> 2072.32
it's like

2072.8 --> 2078.159
i painted that thing

2075.52 --> 2078.159
as a kid

2078.72 --> 2083.2
it's a closet my mother got somewhere

2080.72 --> 2085.7599999999998
and it's always been weird and like half

2083.2 --> 2087.839
the people that i've ever met like

2085.76 --> 2091.2000000000003
really hate that thing including my

2087.839 --> 2093.599
ex-girlfriend who hated it

2091.2 --> 2094.879
really weird

2093.599 --> 2097.6800000000003
i like it

2094.879 --> 2100.0
but it is it's a weird thing because it

2097.68 --> 2101.7599999999998
it does seem like it's alive at times it

2100.0 --> 2103.119
just may starts to make sound and

2101.76 --> 2105.76
drawers like

2103.119 --> 2108.079
open and little out of nowhere very

2105.76 --> 2108.079
weird

2108.16 --> 2112.96
there's something in there

2110.079 --> 2114.1600000000003
i don't know what it is

2112.96 --> 2119.079
but it's not

2114.16 --> 2119.0789999999997
like how to get me or something

2134.8 --> 2137.119
ah

2137.599 --> 2142.4
sun is rising for you kind of bear

2139.76 --> 2142.4
that's nice

2142.48 --> 2147.359
i hope it's going to be a beautiful day

2144.32 --> 2147.3590000000004
as it is over here

2150.88 --> 2154.56

2160.16 --> 2163.92
power winter sleep thing

2164.24 --> 2168.9599999999996
like i did what was it like three days

2166.48 --> 2168.96
ago now

2169.2 --> 2173.839

2207.2 --> 2210.2
hmm

2226.24 --> 2232.9199999999996

2255.04 --> 2259.44
but yeah like intense

2257.52 --> 2262.48
regenerative sleep

2259.44 --> 2266.0
and you you'll recognize it when your

2262.48 --> 2267.68
body like starts to call for it

2266.0 --> 2269.04
it's not something you should do like

2267.68 --> 2271.52
every day

2269.04 --> 2273.92
you know but sometimes it's like your

2271.52 --> 2275.04
body is just going to tell you like yeah

2273.92 --> 2277.359
you're in a

2275.04 --> 2281.2
in a certain type of state and you need

2277.359 --> 2285.359
to sleep to regenerate and you'll like

2281.2 --> 2287.359
pay attention you'll recognize it

2285.359 --> 2290.4
that's what happened to me on thursday

2287.359 --> 2290.4
yeah it was thursday

2293.92 --> 2299.76
and like after that like my entire jaw

2297.28 --> 2302.6400000000003
is like it it feels like it's at an is

2299.76 --> 2305.2000000000003
it's just like new

2302.64 --> 2308.4
it's a whole bunch of gum

2305.2 --> 2313.3999999999996
gums have like regrown at places even

2308.4 --> 2313.4
like very fast it's pretty remarkable

2313.52 --> 2319.52
like had been like in the same condition

2316.079 --> 2322.48
for like half a year and then it just

2319.52 --> 2325.72
like grew back like overnight

2322.48 --> 2325.72
it seems

2327.52 --> 2333.359
but that was like after that long sleep

2332.24 --> 2336.72
so yeah

2333.359 --> 2338.7999999999997
it was definitely regenerative

2336.72 --> 2339.7599999999998
and i did hear the calling so it's like

2338.8 --> 2342.4
okay

2339.76 --> 2344.7200000000003
you can just keep trying to stay awake

2342.4 --> 2348.48
or you can just go to sleep right now

2344.72 --> 2348.48
even though it's a kind of an off time

2348.56 --> 2353.96
and

2349.92 --> 2353.96
and maximize the regeneration

2364.4 --> 2371.079
boils and cools

2367.28 --> 2371.079
hello adam price

2390.0 --> 2393.119
hello rh

2393.52 --> 2399.409
right

2396.32 --> 2399.409
[Music]

2424.8 --> 2428.5600000000004
turtle doves

2427.2 --> 2431.1189999999997
hmm

2428.56 --> 2433.68
i've been seeing quite a few pigeons

2431.119 --> 2435.92
hanging around here all of a sudden

2433.68 --> 2439.1189999999997
it's kind of stayed clear of this roof

2435.92 --> 2440.96
for for most of the year but

2439.119 --> 2443.2000000000003
like in the last few days they seem to

2440.96 --> 2444.56
like come by here

2443.2 --> 2446.96
occasionally

2444.56 --> 2450.599
like the real gray

2446.96 --> 2450.599
big fat pigeons

2470.0 --> 2473.0
huh

2491.92 --> 2497.119
i think by the way that i'm not entirely

2494.72 --> 2501.2
sure but i think there's

2497.119 --> 2501.2000000000003
a crow's nest actually over there

2503.2 --> 2509.9199999999996
but yeah it's been growing bigger and i

2505.839 --> 2512.319
see the crows hang around that one a lot

2509.92 --> 2512.319
i don't know

2513.28 --> 2517.6800000000003
it's the tree directly behind the

2515.119 --> 2517.6800000000003
chimney

2518.24 --> 2522.0
right next to the the end of the

2520.16 --> 2523.68
building there's like a nest in the

2522.0 --> 2527.2
middle of it

2523.68 --> 2529.2
i think that might be a crow's nest

2527.2 --> 2531.2
because it has been growing bigger and

2529.2 --> 2534.0
yet like

2531.2 --> 2537.5989999999997
birds don't typically let other types of

2534.0 --> 2540.16
birds hang around their nest directly

2537.599 --> 2541.52
so i take it that that should make it a

2540.16 --> 2544.48
crow's nest

2541.52 --> 2544.48
which is interesting

2545.52 --> 2551.48
never ever seen a crow's nest that close

2548.24 --> 2551.4799999999996
by ooh

2554.88 --> 2559.04
oh my freaking camera froze again

2562.56 --> 2569.16
well at least it froze actually watching

2565.04 --> 2569.16
the thing that i wanted to show

2621.04 --> 2625.2
they did a cover of blue monday

2625.68 --> 2629.44
could be

2627.119 --> 2633.6800000000003
i have all their cds

2629.44 --> 2635.68
i don't listen to them anymore but yeah

2633.68 --> 2640.1189999999997
blue monday

2635.68 --> 2640.1189999999997
i can literally check that

2653.44 --> 2657.319
if i can find it

2667.2 --> 2669.68
let's see

2675.28 --> 2680.5600000000004
oh great

2676.56 --> 2684.44
make it unintelligible that helps

2680.56 --> 2684.44
no this is not it

2694.64 --> 2697.96
oh great

2730.16 --> 2736.7999999999997
wow that's i i didn't i forget how

2733.52 --> 2740.96
incredibly inconvenient these were

2736.8 --> 2742.88
on purpose just to troll you

2740.96 --> 2746.04
type of negative was definitely about

2742.88 --> 2746.04
the trolling

2753.2 --> 2760.9199999999996
god i can't i can't read that

2757.359 --> 2760.92
i just can't

2765.52 --> 2768.52
nope

2799.119 --> 2803.839
i mean

2800.319 --> 2806.56
i know that type of negative

2803.839 --> 2807.68
thanks type of negative has several

2806.56 --> 2810.88
covers

2807.68 --> 2810.8799999999997
of beetle songs

2814.96 --> 2817.839
but that's about it

2818.8 --> 2823.76
sundays aren't always calm aren't they

2826.4 --> 2829.7200000000003
what do you mean

2861.04 --> 2866.48
okay

2862.72 --> 2868.319
a pair of robins and you named them okay

2866.48 --> 2871.04
how do you know it's

2868.319 --> 2873.839
it's the same ones well they're making a

2871.04 --> 2873.839
nest that makes sense

2879.44 --> 2883.2000000000003
i always have a lot of trouble

2882.0 --> 2886.16
telling

2883.2 --> 2888.96
individual little birds apart they

2886.16 --> 2891.52
really look alike to me every time

2888.96 --> 2894.4
bigger ones i do kind of

2891.52 --> 2896.0
like i feel more of like a character

2894.4 --> 2898.319
difference in those

2896.0 --> 2900.64
the really small birds like robins i

2898.319 --> 2904.16
just can't tell one apart from the other

2900.64 --> 2907.16
i really can't they're like too

2904.16 --> 2907.16
different

2920.48 --> 2923.48
hmm

2942.319 --> 2946.96
yeah yeah rh that is kind of gross

2953.599 --> 2958.7200000000003
and i think adam price was probably

2955.44 --> 2960.2400000000002
talking about a band although

2958.72 --> 2962.7999999999997
why he would

2960.24 --> 2964.64
indulge in that

2962.8 --> 2965.599
i don't know

2964.64 --> 2969.2
i mean

2965.599 --> 2972.7200000000003
i've been like book all seen a bit sort

2969.2 --> 2974.7999999999997
of sort of not really never really a

2972.72 --> 2976.72
hardcore or anything

2974.8 --> 2979.3590000000004
and there were so many bands that just

2976.72 --> 2982.319
had names that were just a straight out

2979.359 --> 2984.72
offense to me and like i just didn't

2982.319 --> 2986.72
like them because of the name

2984.72 --> 2989.5989999999997
and it was weird because a lot of the

2986.72 --> 2991.4399999999996
time if i like heard their songs not

2989.599 --> 2995.319
knowing who they were

2991.44 --> 2995.319
i didn't like them

2998.319 --> 3002.64
like a band has to have the right name

3000.64 --> 3006.0789999999997
and that's just the fact if they don't

3002.64 --> 3009.2
it sucks if it's just gross if it's just

3006.079 --> 3010.88
oh oh we're gonna name it after an

3009.2 --> 3013.839
offensive sin

3010.88 --> 3017.2000000000003
that i'm like okay well [ __ ] you then go

3013.839 --> 3017.2
to hell literally

3017.52 --> 3023.2
i hate those bands i don't like bands

3019.76 --> 3023.2000000000003
that do that i'm just like

3024.16 --> 3031.68
just don't be like a gamma squirt band

3028.559 --> 3031.6800000000003
name i hate those

3037.839 --> 3041.16
you're bad

3046.0 --> 3049.04
i mean yeah you can listen to whatever

3047.76 --> 3050.1600000000003
you like man

3049.04 --> 3052.4
like

3050.16 --> 3054.3999999999996
i was pretty much the only one that even

3052.4 --> 3056.079
did that and everybody's like what do

3054.4 --> 3057.6800000000003
you have against that and like yeah it's

3056.079 --> 3060.6400000000003
[ __ ] gross

3057.68 --> 3065.1189999999997
oh you you call the band that

3060.64 --> 3069.1189999999997
it's like murder death yeah i will never

3065.119 --> 3070.8
ever put on music from a band that calls

3069.119 --> 3072.079
itself murder death i don't know if

3070.8 --> 3074.079
there is one like that i wouldn't be

3072.079 --> 3076.2400000000002
surprised some stupid

3074.079 --> 3079.3590000000004
trash metal

3076.24 --> 3081.68
black doom garage band whatever

3079.359 --> 3084.24
just if i know that a band calls

3081.68 --> 3086.5589999999997
themselves that i just will not listen

3084.24 --> 3088.9599999999996
to it i will hate it

3086.559 --> 3091.3590000000004
and that's just like my mind's made up

3088.96 --> 3092.8
you can't change that

3091.359 --> 3095.5989999999997
and i've always been like that and

3092.8 --> 3097.52
people were always like why

3095.599 --> 3099.52
why do you care it's just a name like

3097.52 --> 3102.079
yeah because freaking name matters

3099.52 --> 3102.079
everything

3105.52 --> 3112.88
but yeah i guess

3107.839 --> 3112.88
i'm the only one or one of very few

3113.04 --> 3117.0
that has always done that

3125.92 --> 3128.92
oh

3140.319 --> 3146.319
all right at least g that's interesting

3144.0 --> 3147.2
i guess you really got a close-up look

3146.319 --> 3150.319
then

3147.2 --> 3150.319
in order to spot that

3150.4 --> 3153.4
cool

3153.76 --> 3157.76
there's like little types of birds here

3156.16 --> 3162.0
too and they

3157.76 --> 3163.28
make a nest like inside of the wall

3162.0 --> 3166.48
they like

3163.28 --> 3169.76
worm themselves through there so there's

3166.48 --> 3172.319
been like little birds here all the time

3169.76 --> 3174.88
they just kind of go a level down they

3172.319 --> 3177.44
don't get on the roof

3174.88 --> 3181.119
they fly past the roof sometimes but

3177.44 --> 3183.68
like the roof is really like the more

3181.119 --> 3187.92
crow type

3183.68 --> 3191.04
territory gross magpies

3187.92 --> 3194.079
and jackdaws and all that

3191.04 --> 3197.119
but like the little type birds i think

3194.079 --> 3197.119
what do you call those

3198.079 --> 3202.96
it's the same one that's also like

3200.48 --> 3206.2
in my intro

3202.96 --> 3206.2
hold on

3208.24 --> 3212.0789999999997
oh yeah great tit of course

3212.64 --> 3217.7599999999998
those types of birds

3215.119 --> 3220.079
very small hyperactive little birds and

3217.76 --> 3223.6800000000003
they're always there i think it's those

3220.079 --> 3225.6800000000003
or it's slightly different maybe it's a

3223.68 --> 3227.2799999999997
a robin as well

3225.68 --> 3228.96
sometimes i don't know maybe they

3227.28 --> 3231.28
exchange but

3228.96 --> 3232.4
they're there they just kind of stay out

3231.28 --> 3233.8390000000004
of the

3232.4 --> 3236.319
the crow

3233.839 --> 3239.44
bird territory

3236.319 --> 3239.44
but they're always there

3240.079 --> 3244.3590000000004
and they always come back every year

3260.4 --> 3264.7200000000003
every bird was a pigeon or sparrow

3262.96 --> 3267.68
really sparrows you had a lot of

3264.72 --> 3267.68
sparrows in london

3269.28 --> 3273.44
we yeah there used to be a lot of

3271.44 --> 3276.0
sparrows

3273.44 --> 3276.0
here too

3276.4 --> 3280.39
wait

3277.28 --> 3283.53
the might still hold on

3280.39 --> 3283.5299999999997
[Applause]

3290.96 --> 3293.839
no

3296.72 --> 3302.0
there might have been

3299.68 --> 3304.16
but yeah when i just look up sparrow

3302.0 --> 3307.64
that's i haven't seen those types of

3304.16 --> 3307.64
birds a lot

3309.359 --> 3314.16
oh now i remember i was thinking of

3311.119 --> 3317.1600000000003
swallow yeah it's not the same thing

3314.16 --> 3317.16
right

3324.88 --> 3329.6600000000003
let me check again

3326.47 --> 3329.66
[Applause]

3340.0 --> 3342.16
um

3341.28 --> 3344.48
right

3342.16 --> 3348.04
i'm mixing it all up oh it's it's it's

3344.48 --> 3350.88
so great that like the dutch names are

3348.04 --> 3354.079
completely and utterly different from

3350.88 --> 3354.079
the english names

3354.4 --> 3360.2000000000003
starlings yeah there's starlings over

3357.2 --> 3360.2
here

3362.64 --> 3367.52
and they form like

3364.48 --> 3367.52
giant flocks

3368.24 --> 3376.1189999999997
like really big flocks

3371.76 --> 3376.119
they're pretty awesome birds

3376.24 --> 3380.16
they don't really typically hang around

3378.24 --> 3382.5589999999997
in the middle of the city they they like

3380.16 --> 3382.5589999999997
to like

3384.16 --> 3388.64
kind of hang at the edge of the city

3389.04 --> 3393.599
like

3391.44 --> 3395.92
yeah i don't really see them

3393.599 --> 3398.7200000000003
a lot right here

3395.92 --> 3401.599
but yeah i remember mostly seeing them

3398.72 --> 3403.2
like when i was like out on the road in

3401.599 --> 3406.7200000000003
a car

3403.2 --> 3406.72
and then you would see

3406.88 --> 3410.799
like

3407.839 --> 3413.839
giant flocks of like a thousand or more

3410.799 --> 3415.04
starlings sitting on electric lines or

3413.839 --> 3419.839
something

3415.04 --> 3419.839
was it electric lights i think so

3420.48 --> 3423.52
and like

3421.52 --> 3426.0
thousands of them like completely

3423.52 --> 3426.0
covered

3427.839 --> 3433.2799999999997
but i never really see them like fly

3430.319 --> 3434.72
around in the city itself i don't know

3433.28 --> 3438.1600000000003
why

3434.72 --> 3438.16
i think they might be more of a

3438.319 --> 3445.799
what is it

3440.48 --> 3445.799
suburban type no not suburban uh

3446.799 --> 3451.44
more like country birds they like

3449.52 --> 3453.04
to have

3451.44 --> 3455.52
like farming

3453.04 --> 3457.7599999999998
white grasslands in the neighborhood or

3455.52 --> 3461.119
something so that might be a reason why

3457.76 --> 3463.599
they avoid the inner city

3461.119 --> 3463.599
i don't know

3466.559 --> 3471.76
starting to go to the city center every

3468.72 --> 3473.7599999999998
night then go back what oh okay

3471.76 --> 3476.7990000000004
might be they they might be doing that

3473.76 --> 3478.0
here as well this is not the city center

3476.799 --> 3480.319
so

3478.0 --> 3481.44
but most of starlings that i've seen

3480.319 --> 3483.44
it's like

3481.44 --> 3484.88
when i was on the road here in the

3483.44 --> 3487.599
netherlands

3484.88 --> 3490.4
and then you see like thousands of them

3487.599 --> 3490.4
thousands

3498.64 --> 3503.48
in london right

3500.48 --> 3503.48
okay

3506.64 --> 3513.319
took pictures of two ducks perched on

3509.599 --> 3513.319
active power lines

3524.88 --> 3531.6400000000003
what

3526.64 --> 3531.64
okay that's one crazy story rh

3536.24 --> 3542.2799999999997
sounds like their life's a sexy

3538.4 --> 3542.28
rollercoaster sometimes

3552.24 --> 3555.24
mm-hmm

3558.64 --> 3561.64
ugh

3583.119 --> 3586.119
so

3590.16 --> 3593.92
what

3592.4 --> 3597.799
okay don't get

3593.92 --> 3597.799
too squirty now

3633.839 --> 3638.24
right yeah i don't necessarily want to

3636.0 --> 3639.68
talk about bird mating habits and all

3638.24 --> 3642.839
that

3639.68 --> 3642.839
you know

3654.559 --> 3657.8390000000004
your bird self

3658.24 --> 3662.5989999999997
adam

3659.359 --> 3662.5989999999997
come on

3673.04 --> 3676.88
screw crown

3675.28 --> 3679.8390000000004
well i take

3676.88 --> 3682.48
that when they do that dive mating they

3679.839 --> 3685.48
do it above the ocean

3682.48 --> 3685.48
right

3685.839 --> 3690.24
i mean maybe they just keep going and

3687.92 --> 3692.88
then they just

3690.24 --> 3696.0789999999997
finish it off like in the ocean or

3692.88 --> 3696.079
something if they hit it

3697.2 --> 3701.9199999999996
i mean you could potentially survive

3699.599 --> 3701.92
that

3702.16 --> 3708.629
the ground not so much you know

3705.3 --> 3708.6290000000004
[Applause]

3712.4 --> 3718.799
and since they are called sea eagles

3715.359 --> 3722.2799999999997
there's a chance that they well do it

3718.799 --> 3722.28
over the sea

3732.72 --> 3737.839
never seen they died doing it

3735.52 --> 3738.839
so do they do it over land or do they do

3737.839 --> 3742.92
it over the

3738.839 --> 3742.92
ocean rh

3767.599 --> 3772.48
over the ocean right okay well that

3769.68 --> 3772.48
makes sense then

3774.64 --> 3778.72
right

3776.0 --> 3783.28
i mean there are plenty of birds that

3778.72 --> 3785.5989999999997
even basically do deep dives they

3783.28 --> 3787.92
just go straight at the water or at a

3785.599 --> 3790.799
very specific angle

3787.92 --> 3793.119
and just full on yeah like a bullet

3790.799 --> 3797.119
shoot into the water to like catch fish

3793.119 --> 3799.359
that are like meters below the surface

3797.119 --> 3801.839
i think eagles might also do that not

3799.359 --> 3803.5989999999997
100 sure

3801.839 --> 3805.119
so

3803.599 --> 3806.559
yeah

3805.119 --> 3808.559
they could

3806.559 --> 3810.88
definitely if they had like that weird

3808.559 --> 3813.2000000000003
mating ritual they could basically do

3810.88 --> 3815.2000000000003
that hit the water and then still come

3813.2 --> 3818.52
flying out of it

3815.2 --> 3818.52
i don't know

3875.2 --> 3878.48
what jfk said

3878.96 --> 3881.839
are you sure

3882.0 --> 3886.559
how does that even work

3884.319 --> 3890.599
what kind of frogs are those i thought

3886.559 --> 3890.599
frogs just laid eggs

3898.16 --> 3903.319
i mean what how does that even work

3935.839 --> 3937.92
you

3956.079 --> 3961.119
oh it's a toad

3958.16 --> 3963.1189999999997
it's not a frog

3961.119 --> 3965.839
it's the surinam

3963.119 --> 3965.839
toad

3970.96 --> 3975.52
pushes the eggs onto their back where

3973.359 --> 3977.5989999999997
they stick to the skin so it's not in

3975.52 --> 3978.799
the back it's just

3977.599 --> 3982.4
stuck

3978.799 --> 3982.4
like glue on their back

3983.039 --> 3988.3190000000004
not like remnants

3986.079 --> 3989.76
the gremlins they literally are in the

3988.319 --> 3992.24
back not

3989.76 --> 3994.7990000000004
stuck on top of it they put it on

3992.24 --> 3994.799
afterward

3998.88 --> 4002.2000000000003
that's funny

4011.76 --> 4014.88
wow

4012.64 --> 4014.8799999999997
and

4015.52 --> 4020.96
they actually just go to full maturity

4018.559 --> 4025.039
there

4020.96 --> 4027.039
they don't break out as tadpoles first

4025.039 --> 4030.7990000000004
they actually just

4027.039 --> 4034.119
go to full maturity

4030.799 --> 4034.119
that's bizarre

4037.52 --> 4042.0
that's a very different type of frog

4046.16 --> 4050.96
or toad it's not technically a frog it's

4048.559 --> 4050.96
a toad

4052.16 --> 4057.1189999999997
or what

4054.64 --> 4058.24
oh wait there might there are frogs i

4057.119 --> 4060.079
guess

4058.24 --> 4063.0789999999997
that do it too

4060.079 --> 4063.079
huh

4084.88 --> 4088.2000000000003
oh [ __ ]

4090.799 --> 4095.44
according to this article it says that

4092.72 --> 4097.44
the serenum toad actually went extinct

4095.44 --> 4100.679
in the 1980s

4097.44 --> 4100.678999999999
the [ __ ]

4106.239 --> 4108.5599999999995
oh

4111.279 --> 4116.2390000000005
they're trying to

4112.88 --> 4119.2390000000005
clone them back into being again

4116.239 --> 4119.239
apparently

4119.44 --> 4122.599999999999
all right

4142.0 --> 4146.799
and some snakes lay eggs and some snakes

4144.64 --> 4149.1990000000005
give birth

4146.799 --> 4149.199
really

4149.279 --> 4152.279
huh

4171.04 --> 4174.48
oh did you know that there's like

4173.04 --> 4176.48
weirder [ __ ]

4174.48 --> 4178.879999999999
going on in nature by by the way

4176.48 --> 4180.4
concerning like how how you carry your

4178.88 --> 4184.2390000000005
kids or something

4180.4 --> 4184.239
i think there's like species of

4184.319 --> 4188.64
fish or like

4186.0 --> 4190.56
not even fish like sea horse type

4188.64 --> 4192.799
creatures i thought

4190.56 --> 4194.96
that literally

4192.799 --> 4197.5199999999995
keep

4194.96 --> 4200.159
like the eggs and until they hatch in

4197.52 --> 4201.360000000001
everything and and the babies like in

4200.159 --> 4203.92
their mouth

4201.36 --> 4206.159
the whole time they literally just keep

4203.92 --> 4209.12
it all in their mouth that's their

4206.159 --> 4209.12
protective room

4210.159 --> 4214.96
so that exists

4211.92 --> 4217.6
i always thought that was hilarious

4214.96 --> 4219.36
just imagining like ah you're constantly

4217.6 --> 4220.96
having your kids in your mouth you have

4219.36 --> 4222.239
to make sure you don't accidentally

4220.96 --> 4226.92
swallow them

4222.239 --> 4226.919999999999
etc this is hilarious

4238.8 --> 4245.360000000001
flat earth early nature show yeah too

4241.92 --> 4249.64
that too i like talking about nature

4245.36 --> 4249.639999999999
there's so much to talk about

4285.84 --> 4291.76
talk about [ __ ] whipped seahorse

4289.679 --> 4294.4800000000005
well sea horses are pretty freaky

4291.76 --> 4297.4400000000005
surreal creatures anyway

4294.48 --> 4299.12
like they're pretty alien compared to

4297.44 --> 4303.04
most

4299.12 --> 4303.04
like living species

4307.76 --> 4313.12
like serious like if you even look like

4311.04 --> 4316.159
how they live what they are and how

4313.12 --> 4319.04
fragile they are it's like

4316.159 --> 4321.199
surreal that they've survived

4319.04 --> 4325.12
in my opinion

4321.199 --> 4329.44
but i guess that they survive by just

4325.12 --> 4331.199
getting like insane amounts of offspring

4329.44 --> 4333.36
so they just like

4331.199 --> 4335.44
one of them is gonna survive and then

4333.36 --> 4338.0
they are gonna have like tens of

4335.44 --> 4340.0
thousands of kids or something so

4338.0 --> 4340.96
i think that they get around like that

4340.0 --> 4344.32
by just

4340.96 --> 4346.88
having insane amounts of offspring

4344.32 --> 4348.0
which is in a way the same tactic that a

4346.88 --> 4349.679
lot of like

4348.0 --> 4351.04
prey fish

4349.679 --> 4353.36
have to

4351.04 --> 4355.36
you know they're very if they're popular

4353.36 --> 4356.719
for being eaten they just

4355.36 --> 4359.88
procreate

4356.719 --> 4359.88
a lot

4370.96 --> 4376.28
i think fallow pawns what's that

4389.12 --> 4393.04
oh

4390.48 --> 4393.04
squiddy

4397.679 --> 4401.4400000000005
squiddy types

4399.6 --> 4402.719
yeah they're very interesting and

4401.44 --> 4404.879999999999
they're

4402.719 --> 4408.159
extremely smart that's the one thing

4404.88 --> 4410.96
that people like super underestimate

4408.159 --> 4413.199
like squids are actually intelligent

4410.96 --> 4415.6
creatures

4413.199 --> 4416.879999999999
they look freaky but they're incredibly

4415.6 --> 4419.679
smart

4416.88 --> 4419.679
for creatures

4419.92 --> 4425.6
of that size

4422.0 --> 4425.6
i guess it's kind of like pigs

4425.76 --> 4428.64
no

4426.96 --> 4430.56
very typical

4428.64 --> 4433.280000000001
and freaky that creatures that are

4430.56 --> 4436.92
relatively popular for eating turn out

4433.28 --> 4436.92
to be quite intelligent

4464.08 --> 4467.5199999999995
but yes the fellow parts squids and all

4466.719 --> 4470.0
that

4467.52 --> 4473.52
they have intelligence that's very

4470.0 --> 4475.6
comparable to like mammal intelligence

4473.52 --> 4478.56
where they will actually apply

4475.6 --> 4480.88
distraction tactics and all that

4478.56 --> 4484.2390000000005
like ducks would act like oh i got a

4480.88 --> 4486.8
broken wing oh no i'm so endangered come

4484.239 --> 4489.44
after me predator

4486.8 --> 4492.56
squids do that sort of [ __ ] too

4489.44 --> 4494.879999999999
it's really epic and they have like

4492.56 --> 4496.719
special coloring skin and all that that

4494.88 --> 4498.96
they can apply with that trickery as

4496.719 --> 4502.64
well there's squids that can actually

4498.96 --> 4504.32
hypnotize their prey like that

4502.64 --> 4508.0
it's like literally they're they're

4504.32 --> 4508.0
using their color to just like

4508.84 --> 4513.84
whoop induce seizures and then they just

4512.32 --> 4517.08
grab him

4513.84 --> 4517.08
it's amazing

4531.28 --> 4534.28
hmm

4543.84 --> 4549.52
i never liked eating calamari

4547.36 --> 4550.5599999999995
especially when i could literally see

4549.52 --> 4552.4800000000005
them

4550.56 --> 4553.92
because it always gave me a feeling

4552.48 --> 4555.839999999999
they're like it's there's something

4553.92 --> 4557.4400000000005
really wrong about this

4555.84 --> 4560.32
i never really knew what it was just

4557.44 --> 4562.48
thought oh they look so freaky

4560.32 --> 4564.0
but then when i discovered through

4562.48 --> 4566.4
nature documentaries that they're

4564.0 --> 4568.96
actually really intelligent now i knew

4566.4 --> 4570.799999999999
what it feels like it feels almost like

4568.96 --> 4573.36
cannibalism

4570.8 --> 4574.64
or like the skeksis remember from the

4573.36 --> 4576.88
dark crystal

4574.64 --> 4580.719
eating all those creatures it's just

4576.88 --> 4584.56
like that's just it feels so wrong

4580.719 --> 4584.56
so i don't like eating calamari

4585.28 --> 4589.92
because it just feels wrong

4587.76 --> 4592.88
it's like we shouldn't

4589.92 --> 4595.4400000000005
do that to these creatures

4592.88 --> 4597.4400000000005
that's me personally you know

4595.44 --> 4599.599999999999
there's people that are a big fan of

4597.44 --> 4602.159
eating calamari and i'm just not going

4599.6 --> 4605.360000000001
to stop them but i don't want to do that

4602.159 --> 4606.96
just like i don't want to eat pig either

4605.36 --> 4608.88
since i figured out that they're

4606.96 --> 4611.88
actually really smart and loyal

4608.88 --> 4611.88
creatures

4624.88 --> 4628.0
yeah platypus

4631.28 --> 4638.08
a kid no

4634.159 --> 4638.08
i don't recognize that name what's that

4644.32 --> 4648.96
oh

4645.76 --> 4652.400000000001
right it's like

4648.96 --> 4652.4
sort of an armadillo

4652.88 --> 4657.04
that's a weird thing

4654.96 --> 4658.8
it's like an armadillo hedgehog or

4657.04 --> 4660.64
something

4658.8 --> 4664.84
weird

4660.64 --> 4664.84
they look super cute though

4683.679 --> 4686.56
yeah

4684.48 --> 4688.799999999999
yeah rh

4686.56 --> 4690.96
no it's like

4688.8 --> 4693.1990000000005
when i see octopus

4690.96 --> 4694.88
and i have seen octopus and squids in

4693.199 --> 4696.32
the ocean actually

4694.88 --> 4699.36
living

4696.32 --> 4701.679
i just want to communicate with them

4699.36 --> 4706.32
it's like they're

4701.679 --> 4708.64
another species or they are but like

4706.32 --> 4711.12
i just got the feeling like i could

4708.64 --> 4713.280000000001
potentially communicate them with them

4711.12 --> 4716.88
on their level i have been able to do

4713.28 --> 4718.719
that with like other land animals

4716.88 --> 4720.56
to a certain degree

4718.719 --> 4722.56
but i just got that feeling with like

4720.56 --> 4724.080000000001
these creatures are really smart they

4722.56 --> 4725.280000000001
probably have

4724.08 --> 4728.88
like a

4725.28 --> 4733.08
culture and maybe even a shared spirit

4728.88 --> 4733.08
just like humans in a way

4735.28 --> 4739.759999999999
i mean it would be pretty epic if you

4737.6 --> 4742.08
could have like a

4739.76 --> 4744.2390000000005
an octopus

4742.08 --> 4746.239
that would be an actual pet

4744.239 --> 4749.919999999999
that you could train

4746.239 --> 4751.5199999999995
to literally just like oh come along

4749.92 --> 4753.28
octo

4751.52 --> 4754.4800000000005
it just rides along on your arm and that

4753.28 --> 4757.12
you could like

4754.48 --> 4758.799999999999
okay go get that fish

4757.12 --> 4760.88
and they would go get it or something

4758.8 --> 4762.400000000001
you know i don't know

4760.88 --> 4764.8
maybe i've been playing too much

4762.4 --> 4766.639999999999
dungeons and dragons in

4764.8 --> 4768.96
in my past

4766.64 --> 4770.400000000001
where you can actually do that

4768.96 --> 4772.719
there's like

4770.4 --> 4774.799999999999
classes where you literally can get an

4772.719 --> 4776.8
animal companions just like okay choose

4774.8 --> 4778.4800000000005
what do you want

4776.8 --> 4780.56
i mean you could get a hedgehog you

4778.48 --> 4782.639999999999
could get a giant bear you could get an

4780.56 --> 4786.080000000001
octopus

4782.64 --> 4788.56
you could get a dinosaur this is just

4786.08 --> 4791.5599999999995
another creature there

4788.56 --> 4791.56
right

4792.88 --> 4795.6
but i don't know maybe it might be

4794.4 --> 4797.5199999999995
possible

4795.6 --> 4799.679
to to kind of

4797.52 --> 4802.080000000001
get an understanding with creatures like

4799.679 --> 4802.88
that and train them a bit to be like a

4802.08 --> 4806.5599999999995
pet

4802.88 --> 4806.56
the sort of domesticate them

4817.6 --> 4820.320000000001
cuttlefish

4827.92 --> 4832.679
cuttlefish is a kind of squid right

4834.96 --> 4839.6
yeah

4836.719 --> 4842.159
cuddle fish are epic

4839.6 --> 4843.280000000001
like they're the ones that are like

4842.159 --> 4845.679
that are

4843.28 --> 4846.5599999999995
that can do magic with their skin color

4845.679 --> 4848.56
right

4846.56 --> 4850.639
cuttlefish are the ones that actually

4848.56 --> 4854.84
hypnotize prey and [ __ ] with their

4850.639 --> 4854.84
colorscape it's amazing

4894.96 --> 4897.28
hmm

4897.679 --> 4900.32
octopus

4901.199 --> 4905.839999999999
wait is a cuttlefish like completely

4903.36 --> 4908.719
separate from a squid

4905.84 --> 4908.719
what's the difference

4910.03 --> 4914.239
[Applause]

4913.04 --> 4916.96
not

4914.239 --> 4916.959999999999
no what

4920.37 --> 4929.67
[Applause]

4955.92 --> 4959.76
okay

4957.199 --> 4961.919999999999
so they're effectively the same type of

4959.76 --> 4965.04
creature they just have a different type

4961.92 --> 4968.32
of skull basically

4965.04 --> 4968.32
bone structure

4969.12 --> 4975.8
but they're like almost exactly the same

4971.92 --> 4975.8
other than that interesting

4988.56 --> 4993.280000000001
oh stretch syndrome what are you talking

4990.719 --> 4994.32
about adam price

4993.28 --> 4997.12
you mean

4994.32 --> 5000.5199999999995
putting your head in the sand ignoring

4997.12 --> 5000.5199999999995
willing ignorance

5034.48 --> 5038.759999999999
let's see if hello pods

5056.56 --> 5059.52
right

5057.44 --> 5060.96
okay so they're called cephalopods

5059.52 --> 5064.320000000001
that's interesting i didn't know they

5060.96 --> 5064.32
had a group name together

5064.4 --> 5068.08
to me was just squids

5068.32 --> 5072.48
octopus

5069.6 --> 5073.84
and cattle cuttlefish

5072.48 --> 5078.04
but apparently they're called

5073.84 --> 5078.04
cephalopods all right

5090.96 --> 5095.12
was by the way ridiculous when i looked

5092.96 --> 5097.44
it up what it all meant

5095.12 --> 5099.84
they sneaked in like oh this is the

5097.44 --> 5103.28
reason why they have that

5099.84 --> 5105.360000000001
it's like remnant from ancient evolution

5103.28 --> 5106.159
they did they have to sneak that [ __ ] in

5105.36 --> 5109.5199999999995
there

5106.159 --> 5111.5199999999995
right it's complete horseshit

5109.52 --> 5113.76
like these creatures are just these

5111.52 --> 5117.96
creatures

5113.76 --> 5121.280000000001
they're not ancient ancestors from some

5117.96 --> 5122.639
primordial evolution based

5121.28 --> 5124.8
far past

5122.639 --> 5127.76
no these are the creatures that's what

5124.8 --> 5130.4800000000005
they are

5127.76 --> 5134.159000000001
and they've probably been like that for

5130.48 --> 5136.718999999999
a very very long time

5134.159 --> 5139.44
kind of just like sharks even though in

5136.719 --> 5142.719
the evolution spectrum

5139.44 --> 5144.799999999999
they say the shark is almost unchanged

5142.719 --> 5147.12
for millions of years

5144.8 --> 5147.12
why

5147.76 --> 5152.08
no reason makes no sense no no logical

5150.32 --> 5154.239
backing for that it's just although the

5152.08 --> 5156.239
shark is unchanged

5154.239 --> 5157.599999999999
but all these other creatures have

5156.239 --> 5160.08
evolved

5157.6 --> 5162.2390000000005
how do they even know that the shark has

5160.08 --> 5165.04
not been changed if they just decided

5162.239 --> 5167.5199999999995
when digging up some

5165.04 --> 5169.12
some petrified shark skeleton somewhere

5167.52 --> 5172.56
or something it's like oh yeah that

5169.12 --> 5177.12
means that they were exactly alike

5172.56 --> 5177.120000000001
in millions and millions of years ago

5178.32 --> 5182.199
evolution you know

5189.12 --> 5191.84
right

5190.239 --> 5194.4
just for the record evolution is

5191.84 --> 5198.08
complete horror [ __ ]

5194.4 --> 5201.04
there's no empirical foundation to

5198.08 --> 5202.8
assume that anything like evolution even

5201.04 --> 5205.6
exists

5202.8 --> 5207.679
there's only adaptation

5205.6 --> 5210.4800000000005
guided by entropy

5207.679 --> 5213.04
and that is it there had to be a design

5210.48 --> 5215.759999999999
for all of it at at the start

5213.04 --> 5219.92
it was more optimized it was all better

5215.76 --> 5221.92
and because of the wearing of time

5219.92 --> 5226.4
the condition set

5221.92 --> 5226.4
by god for the time-based creation

5226.8 --> 5231.679
yeah it's all

5228.159 --> 5233.839999999999
getting less efficient

5231.679 --> 5237.1990000000005
still functional but less efficient and

5233.84 --> 5239.84
then it has to adapt to that

5237.199 --> 5244.159
it's like the entire

5239.84 --> 5246.88
congregation of life itself is slowly

5244.159 --> 5249.28
growing more demented over time but

5246.88 --> 5252.28
learning to deal with every level of

5249.28 --> 5252.28
dementia

5254.32 --> 5259.679
and

5255.36 --> 5259.679
there are effectively species that

5260.239 --> 5265.718999999999
over the generation seem to lose very

5262.719 --> 5265.719
little

5266.32 --> 5271.44
right so maybe it does have to do with

5269.84 --> 5274.719
sin

5271.44 --> 5276.239
maybe sin is

5274.719 --> 5278.84
like

5276.239 --> 5282.48
partially at least responsible for

5278.84 --> 5285.1990000000005
entropy taking place

5282.48 --> 5288.4
in species which is a weird idea because

5285.199 --> 5290.32
we associate sin only with humanity and

5288.4 --> 5293.04
conscious decision right

5290.32 --> 5296.5599999999995
but what if the same mechanism does also

5293.04 --> 5299.679
apply for the consciousness of animals

5296.56 --> 5302.719
how can we per definition exclude that

5299.679 --> 5305.36
as a possibility with all we've learned

5302.719 --> 5309.92
about the consciousness and social

5305.36 --> 5314.32
intricacies of animals you know

5309.92 --> 5314.32
are they subjected to god's laws

5315.28 --> 5323.28
well not to the human laws in a human

5318.239 --> 5325.44
sense right but still the mechanisms

5323.28 --> 5328.88
are very likely to

5325.44 --> 5331.879999999999
have the same spirit

5328.88 --> 5331.88
anyway

5332.86 --> 5335.978999999999
[Music]

5421.36 --> 5427.759999999999
[ __ ] microphone

5423.44 --> 5427.759999999999
god dammit you piece of [ __ ]

5432.719 --> 5437.92
where did i leave off

5435.76 --> 5440.400000000001
god damn it i had a really great train

5437.92 --> 5440.4
of thought

5444.96 --> 5450.96
right i was talking about the flood

5448.4 --> 5452.879999999999
what do we know about it what supposedly

5450.96 --> 5455.44
in the context of all the stories caused

5452.88 --> 5458.159000000001
it it was the creation of genetically

5455.44 --> 5459.678999999999
modified mutant monsters

5458.159 --> 5462.239
wasn't it

5459.679 --> 5465.679
that's what we kind of learned from a

5462.239 --> 5467.759999999999
lot of different angles of perspective

5465.679 --> 5470.639
about the flood it was

5467.76 --> 5474.159000000001
likely triggered somehow because of the

5470.639 --> 5476.8
creation of serious monsters that are

5474.159 --> 5478.239
like all insane

5476.8 --> 5481.76
godless

5478.239 --> 5481.759999999999
and sometimes gigantic

5481.92 --> 5486.639
so what could we conclude

5484.56 --> 5491.84
we could conclude that there was an

5486.639 --> 5491.84
ability to quickly create

5493.52 --> 5498.080000000001
these things

5495.28 --> 5500.719
insert different species together and

5498.08 --> 5503.28
create monsters it was a thing it

5500.719 --> 5506.08
happened quickly it's not something oh

5503.28 --> 5509.199
we all had to prepare for that for 200

5506.08 --> 5511.199
years no it apparently all happened very

5509.199 --> 5513.04
quickly it's just like poor [ __ ]

5511.199 --> 5514.879999999999
together and then over the course of

5513.04 --> 5518.56
like days or a week

5514.88 --> 5521.04
a creature would just pop out

5518.56 --> 5522.88
out of what they were doing

5521.04 --> 5525.199
however that happened right

5522.88 --> 5527.679
some kind of a weird egg or something i

5525.199 --> 5530.32
don't know exactly what they did

5527.679 --> 5534.4800000000005
but it happened pretty quickly so

5530.32 --> 5537.199
based on that assumption based data i

5534.48 --> 5538.879999999999
guess or conceptual data you could say

5537.199 --> 5540.48
which is kind of a self-contradicting

5538.88 --> 5542.96
thing but

5540.48 --> 5544.839999999999
onto that premise

5542.96 --> 5546.4
we could conclude

5544.84 --> 5550.56
that

5546.4 --> 5552.96
in response to the flood arriving which

5550.56 --> 5555.1990000000005
was pretty rapidly but there were

5552.96 --> 5556.96
predictions that something like that was

5555.199 --> 5559.12
gonna happen right

5556.96 --> 5560.8
even

5559.12 --> 5562.88
because noah

5560.8 --> 5565.679
basically called it quite long in

5562.88 --> 5567.679
advance so there was rumors of something

5565.679 --> 5570.0
like that might happen that it might

5567.679 --> 5572.4800000000005
happen right well that means

5570.0 --> 5572.48
that these

5572.639 --> 5577.52
these beings that were

5574.48 --> 5579.36
being created that the creator of them

5577.52 --> 5580.88
that was basically creating these

5579.36 --> 5583.679
mutants

5580.88 --> 5584.56
could have planned

5583.679 --> 5588.96
to

5584.56 --> 5591.280000000001
adapt creatures to ocean to the ocean

5588.96 --> 5593.199
right to like oh

5591.28 --> 5595.04
if there's going to be a flood we don't

5593.199 --> 5596.879999999999
know if it's even going to go away we

5595.04 --> 5598.159
are going to choose a strategical

5596.88 --> 5599.84
survival

5598.159 --> 5605.28
by adapting

5599.84 --> 5605.28
the creations two oceanic permanents

5608.8 --> 5611.8
right

5616.719 --> 5621.36
now let me try to get back

5619.28 --> 5623.44
creatures changing to marine life to

5621.36 --> 5626.48
survive the flood yeah

5623.44 --> 5626.48
so maybe they did

5628.0 --> 5632.48
maybe even some of these creatures

5634.639 --> 5639.52
have actually persisted

5637.12 --> 5642.239
now i'm not trying to diss them right

5639.52 --> 5644.8
but i think that maybe pigs

5642.239 --> 5648.0
were actually originally genetically

5644.8 --> 5648.0
modified creatures

5648.88 --> 5653.1990000000005
with the specific purposes but maybe

5651.28 --> 5656.239
things like cuttlefish

5653.199 --> 5659.678999999999
are also like

5656.239 --> 5661.919999999999
remnants of ability

5659.679 --> 5665.04
that they basically

5661.92 --> 5666.8
like they to preserve the abilities in

5665.04 --> 5669.679
themselves

5666.8 --> 5672.4800000000005
they made a creature out of it to

5669.679 --> 5674.719
preserve the ability within

5672.48 --> 5677.44
a species

5674.719 --> 5679.76
right because who knows what they were

5677.44 --> 5680.96
figuring out as they were creating these

5679.76 --> 5682.88
mutants

5680.96 --> 5684.8
how do we know that

5682.88 --> 5687.76
every creature that is out there right

5684.8 --> 5690.8
now was an original creation from god

5687.76 --> 5692.4800000000005
and exactly how he created it at the

5690.8 --> 5693.8
start

5692.48 --> 5696.718999999999
when there's been so much

5693.8 --> 5698.88
experimentation that preceded the flood

5696.719 --> 5700.88
genetic experimentation so maybe there

5698.88 --> 5703.4400000000005
are creatures around

5700.88 --> 5703.4400000000005
that are

5703.6 --> 5709.639
like little

5705.44 --> 5709.638999999999
scoops of experimentation

5711.04 --> 5716.84
concealed or

5712.84 --> 5720.4800000000005
encapsulated within a confined

5716.84 --> 5720.4800000000005
self-perpetuating species

5722.0 --> 5725.04
which would also

5723.6 --> 5727.119000000001
kind of like

5725.04 --> 5730.639
explain why some of these creatures are

5727.119 --> 5730.639
so incredibly intelligent

5732.88 --> 5736.0
because why else

5736.4 --> 5740.96
i don't know maybe

5738.32 --> 5744.08
yeah maybe this is

5740.96 --> 5747.76
not correct i was just thinking about it

5744.08 --> 5747.76
based on what kevlar said

5753.679 --> 5757.76
right

5754.56 --> 5760.2390000000005
because maybe the katulin species or

5757.76 --> 5762.88
whatever the squid people as i used to

5760.239 --> 5765.678999999999
call them originally

5762.88 --> 5769.1990000000005
reasoned out that they might be from the

5765.679 --> 5771.28
very ocean of another layer a realm

5769.199 --> 5774.4
layer above us

5771.28 --> 5776.48
that god then open up to deposit all the

5774.4 --> 5778.48
oceanic water maybe some of those

5776.48 --> 5780.879999999999
creatures came

5778.48 --> 5782.48
from there here

5780.88 --> 5786.32
in this realm

5782.48 --> 5786.32
but it could also be that

5786.639 --> 5792.159000000001
the squid people that are

5788.96 --> 5796.0
yeah mythically talked about

5792.159 --> 5796.0
that they were basically the

5796.639 --> 5803.679
what would you call them the nephilim

5800.56 --> 5804.360000000001
changing themselves to be more aquatic

5803.679 --> 5806.08
in

5804.36 --> 5808.719
anticipation

5806.08 --> 5809.76
of the flood

5808.719 --> 5811.119
right

5809.76 --> 5812.4400000000005
both seem

5811.119 --> 5816.839999999999
viable

5812.44 --> 5816.839999999999
possibilities conceptually

5839.84 --> 5843.4400000000005
salt in her blood same concentration as

5842.08 --> 5845.6
yeah but why

5843.44 --> 5847.919999999999
it's not that's because

5845.6 --> 5849.6
salt and water

5847.92 --> 5852.84
are electrical

5849.6 --> 5854.8
right water without the salt does not

5852.84 --> 5856.719
conduct

5854.8 --> 5859.04
we have salt in us because we are

5856.719 --> 5861.6
actually electric beings

5859.04 --> 5864.4
our spirit is

5861.6 --> 5869.679
so without salt

5864.4 --> 5875.0
our spirit cannot properly do its thing

5869.679 --> 5875.0
because we'll run out of electric energy

5891.84 --> 5896.4400000000005
they're fat lazy and dumb in comparison

5896.48 --> 5901.36
well only out of necessity

5899.119 --> 5903.839999999999
right i mean kevlar as soon like

5901.36 --> 5907.5199999999995
seriously

5903.84 --> 5909.92
as soon as the the convention of

5907.52 --> 5912.639
civilization is ended when there's

5909.92 --> 5916.0
literally nobody left to basically keep

5912.639 --> 5918.88
protecting everybody

5916.0 --> 5921.76
then all that fatness and laziness is

5918.88 --> 5924.08
going to be over very quickly

5921.76 --> 5927.1990000000005
literally

5924.08 --> 5930.08
like a bunch of blimp people

5927.199 --> 5932.96
over potentially one or two generations

5930.08 --> 5935.04
could turn straight back into hulk like

5932.96 --> 5936.719
warriors

5935.04 --> 5939.119
just like that

5936.719 --> 5941.04
just like that why aren't they

5939.119 --> 5943.839999999999
because they're all

5941.04 --> 5945.92
like little spoiled rotten kids that

5943.84 --> 5948.32
never have to grow up

5945.92 --> 5949.76
because there's always somebody there

5948.32 --> 5950.48
that's gonna say

5949.76 --> 5952.400000000001
no

5950.48 --> 5954.48
we're just gonna protect you

5952.4 --> 5956.719
no matter what no matter how [ __ ]

5954.48 --> 5959.28
insane and stupid and [ __ ] and

5956.719 --> 5961.92
repulsive you get

5959.28 --> 5961.92
that's why

5964.719 --> 5968.159
right

5965.6 --> 5973.360000000001
it's the convention

5968.159 --> 5973.36
of man that keeps it the way it is

5974.48 --> 5983.28
it's the agreement to never go to those

5979.36 --> 5986.639
well barbaric levels of functioning

5983.28 --> 5988.96
that keeps you fat and bloated

5986.639 --> 5991.92
and happy and delusional

5988.96 --> 5994.92
or not not so happy maybe delusional

5991.92 --> 5994.92
definitely

6007.44 --> 6009.839999999999
yeah

6010.4 --> 6013.36
i mean like

6013.44 --> 6018.719
you know this would work right if this

6016.239 --> 6019.678999999999
sounds kind of like

6018.719 --> 6021.679
not

6019.679 --> 6022.56
maybe a thing you'd literally want to do

6021.679 --> 6024.719
but

6022.56 --> 6029.4400000000005
you just take a bunch of like

6024.719 --> 6029.44
fat dumb average americans

6029.679 --> 6034.84
and if you literally just like corner

6032.32 --> 6037.44
them off and like cut them off from

6034.84 --> 6038.56
civilization but with enough territory

6037.44 --> 6041.678999999999
to actually

6038.56 --> 6044.4800000000005
yeah get their own food and whatever

6041.679 --> 6045.84
they'll turn from absolute idiotic

6044.48 --> 6048.32
retards

6045.84 --> 6052.08
that are drug like pharmaceutical drug

6048.32 --> 6055.5199999999995
dependent of psychological issues

6052.08 --> 6058.88
yeah they might just die right

6055.52 --> 6061.52
but they could also radically transform

6058.88 --> 6064.08
and like after years you would not

6061.52 --> 6066.2390000000005
recognize those people they would not

6064.08 --> 6068.8
look the same in shape they would not

6066.239 --> 6071.119
look the same in their eyes

6068.8 --> 6072.159000000001
they would quickly

6071.119 --> 6075.04
adapt

6072.159 --> 6077.5199999999995
and actually invoke their ancestral

6075.04 --> 6081.04
skills and spirit

6077.52 --> 6081.040000000001
because they had to

6083.199 --> 6085.5199999999995
right

6085.84 --> 6089.1990000000005
so

6086.719 --> 6092.2390000000005
every time i hear like oh

6089.199 --> 6096.4
fat stupid americans i'm like yeah it's

6092.239 --> 6096.4
really [ __ ] ugly i agree but

6096.8 --> 6101.679
it's really like spoiled kid syndrome

6100.08 --> 6102.719
because they do

6101.679 --> 6105.679
have

6102.719 --> 6108.0
all this dormant

6105.679 --> 6110.08
ability within it it is really there

6108.0 --> 6112.159
it's just that it won't come out it's

6110.08 --> 6114.48
like a stupid little kid that's

6112.159 --> 6115.759999999999
physically growing up but mentally isn't

6114.48 --> 6117.28
growing up

6115.76 --> 6120.08
sometimes literally that's what's

6117.28 --> 6123.599999999999
happening but it's because they don't

6120.08 --> 6128.0
need to grow up to survive they can be

6123.6 --> 6130.8
[ __ ] fat and [ __ ] and degenerated

6128.0 --> 6133.28
and useless and still make it through

6130.8 --> 6137.52
and probably even procreate

6133.28 --> 6138.4
yeah idiocracy it's the luxury

6137.52 --> 6142.159000000001
right

6138.4 --> 6146.0
it's also partially a paradox within

6142.159 --> 6147.839999999999
the idiocracy movie and that is

6146.0 --> 6149.6
yeah they get all super dumb and then

6147.84 --> 6151.76
everybody's so freaking dumb they don't

6149.6 --> 6153.76
even know how to operate their

6151.76 --> 6155.679
appliances anymore

6153.76 --> 6159.280000000001
well the thing is if that point would be

6155.679 --> 6163.119
reached then suddenly

6159.28 --> 6166.8
they have to very quickly everybody grow

6163.119 --> 6169.92
up get smart or they all die

6166.8 --> 6172.159000000001
very quickly all of them right that's

6169.92 --> 6174.8
the paradox of that movie is that they

6172.159 --> 6177.28
keep stuck in the stupid which in

6174.8 --> 6180.400000000001
physical reality is impossible

6177.28 --> 6182.8
they would all die

6180.4 --> 6184.719
although it's kind of suggested that

6182.8 --> 6186.4800000000005
that is like on the verge of happening

6184.719 --> 6188.32
since they don't even know that you need

6186.48 --> 6191.599999999999
to spray water on crops to make them

6188.32 --> 6193.759999999999
grow right it's pretty miraculous that

6191.6 --> 6196.159000000001
any of them are still alive in that

6193.76 --> 6196.159000000001
movie

6197.52 --> 6201.84
but in reality

6199.679 --> 6204.4
it's the luxury

6201.84 --> 6207.1990000000005
and the ability to survive even though

6204.4 --> 6211.28
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

6207.199 --> 6211.28
that keeps you a [ __ ] [ __ ]

6211.36 --> 6215.92
that's it that's the main cause

6214.0 --> 6218.4
and you might be surprised at how

6215.92 --> 6222.8
dynamic people actually can be

6218.4 --> 6225.839999999999
once that backdrop situation

6222.8 --> 6229.92
stops and turns around and then you have

6225.84 --> 6233.92
to actually grow up or or you die

6229.92 --> 6236.639
and people underestimate how well

6233.92 --> 6239.119
even dumb people have been like that for

6236.639 --> 6241.6
a lot of their lives can actually turn

6239.119 --> 6244.639
around if they're just forced

6241.6 --> 6244.639
yeah force

6244.84 --> 6249.360000000001
force

6246.639 --> 6251.76
force turns it around and they won't be

6249.36 --> 6254.159
thankful at first

6251.76 --> 6256.0
and might not end up being thankful at

6254.159 --> 6259.799999999999
the end

6256.0 --> 6259.8
but they should be

6260.719 --> 6268.119
because ignorance is bliss

6263.92 --> 6268.119
but it does get you killed

6278.239 --> 6282.718999999999
right and if it doesn't get your species

6281.6 --> 6287.8
killed

6282.719 --> 6287.8
then it will get your mind killed

6309.6 --> 6313.84
good times make idiots well that's a

6311.52 --> 6317.159000000001
historically known fact

6313.84 --> 6317.159000000001
gordy mckernan

6317.36 --> 6319.599999999999
right

6320.159 --> 6325.28
adversity makes men prosperity makes

6322.639 --> 6325.28
monsters

6328.96 --> 6334.4800000000005
that's how it works it's a cycle

6331.36 --> 6337.5199999999995
everybody goes through the cycle

6334.48 --> 6337.5199999999995
wherever it's at

6338.159 --> 6344.638999999999
it's generational often

6341.6 --> 6347.6
right there's always like a back forth

6344.639 --> 6349.4400000000005
thing feedback system happening with

6347.6 --> 6351.679
generations

6349.44 --> 6352.799999999999
it has to be that way there's no other

6351.679 --> 6355.6
way

6352.8 --> 6355.6
we could do it

6356.48 --> 6362.239
right

6359.199 --> 6363.28
don't let victory defeat you

6362.239 --> 6366.32
and

6363.28 --> 6369.48
sometimes losing is the greatest victory

6366.32 --> 6369.48
of all

6372.8 --> 6378.2390000000005
but only if you tried like

6375.04 --> 6380.48
losing is only a victory if you actually

6378.239 --> 6382.638999999999
really made an effort

6380.48 --> 6384.4
because then you have grown out of the

6382.639 --> 6387.36
failure

6384.4 --> 6388.48
right because you actually try

6387.36 --> 6392.4
now

6388.48 --> 6394.159
achieving victory especially quickly

6392.4 --> 6397.36
often

6394.159 --> 6398.839999999999
puts you on another level mentally

6397.36 --> 6403.679
where you start to

6398.84 --> 6406.4800000000005
dilapidate so a quick victory is usually

6403.679 --> 6410.56
usually leads to tragedy like that it

6406.48 --> 6410.5599999999995
just happens it just happens

6411.199 --> 6415.678999999999
right

6412.08 --> 6417.199
the best victory is the one that is hard

6415.679 --> 6419.119
earned

6417.199 --> 6421.839999999999
that you had to make mistakes for that

6419.119 --> 6423.839999999999
you had to fight to get there

6421.84 --> 6425.04
those are the best victories because

6423.84 --> 6426.159000000001
they

6425.04 --> 6429.28
actually

6426.159 --> 6431.199
help you ascend to stay on that level

6429.28 --> 6434.08
and to not dilapidate because you

6431.199 --> 6436.0
understand the value of it

6434.08 --> 6439.04
and you understand the value of the

6436.0 --> 6442.32
struggle it's cemented

6439.04 --> 6444.56
into your spirit through your struggle a

6442.32 --> 6446.799999999999
quickly attained victory

6444.56 --> 6449.4400000000005
doesn't do that

6446.8 --> 6453.159000000001
it kind of just appeals to your ego and

6449.44 --> 6453.159
makes you greedy

6458.08 --> 6463.119
all right goldie i'll just call you

6459.76 --> 6463.119000000001
goldie if that's what you want

6464.88 --> 6470.08
but i i usually just

6466.8 --> 6473.360000000001
i i pronounce everybody's name full

6470.08 --> 6477.04
unless it's like a whole mouthful

6473.36 --> 6477.04
if it's like a two-sentence thing

6479.679 --> 6484.28
is your goodness what the [ __ ]

6485.119 --> 6489.36
is that in reflection to what i just

6486.8 --> 6491.52
been talking about steamy traveler

6489.36 --> 6494.0
i mean i could get all cryptic about it

6491.52 --> 6498.6
what's my greatest victory

6494.0 --> 6498.6
it's the depth of my failure

6499.679 --> 6505.4400000000005
my greatest victory is that i was unable

6502.96 --> 6508.44
to integrate within the societal

6505.44 --> 6508.44
standard

6512.08 --> 6516.239
and because of that

6513.92 --> 6519.04
i have taken on a new mission to

6516.239 --> 6520.879999999999
actually from the position of where i'm

6519.04 --> 6523.36
not integrated

6520.88 --> 6526.0
back engineer what is needed to

6523.36 --> 6528.239
reintegrate from a higher spiritual

6526.0 --> 6530.32
level within that same society that i

6528.239 --> 6532.159
fail to integrate within

6530.32 --> 6534.639
from a more basic

6532.159 --> 6534.638999999999
approach

6539.199 --> 6545.4
i'm gonna get some grapefruit juice

6541.92 --> 6545.4
be right back

6620.639 --> 6622.84
ah

6621.84 --> 6628.1990000000005
that's

6622.84 --> 6628.1990000000005
nice oh it's getting a bit chilly though

6649.52 --> 6652.8
yeah

6650.56 --> 6655.1990000000005
reminds me

6652.8 --> 6657.76
something i said yesterday that was like

6655.199 --> 6659.5199999999995
a really heavy fractal truth it's coming

6657.76 --> 6661.52
back to me now

6659.52 --> 6664.4800000000005
when he was saying like why do you keep

6661.52 --> 6666.56
asking why why why

6664.48 --> 6668.879999999999
why is a pointless question that can

6666.56 --> 6672.4800000000005
never be resolved it's basically a

6668.88 --> 6675.04
tactic just to drain you

6672.48 --> 6678.959999999999
right to get to that end point why why

6675.04 --> 6682.08
why why why why why it never has to end

6678.96 --> 6683.84
if you say what

6682.08 --> 6685.199
what is

6683.84 --> 6686.56
or how

6685.199 --> 6688.4
is it

6686.56 --> 6690.719
if those are the questions you ask

6688.4 --> 6693.44
instead

6690.719 --> 6696.2390000000005
they are finite they are per definition

6693.44 --> 6700.08
finite because they are specific

6696.239 --> 6701.28
they don't form into a loop

6700.08 --> 6702.48
what

6701.28 --> 6705.44
and how

6702.48 --> 6710.239
are always good questions

6705.44 --> 6712.799999999999
with a finite nature that will help you

6710.239 --> 6716.0
attain data about things

6712.8 --> 6718.56
and structure within that oversight for

6716.0 --> 6720.8
the long run

6718.56 --> 6723.119000000001
yeah it's something i actually learned

6720.8 --> 6725.04
from my parents even though they did not

6723.119 --> 6728.88
come up with it

6725.04 --> 6731.84
they just pointed at that asking why

6728.88 --> 6731.84
leads to nothing

6732.48 --> 6736.239
they told me that as a very little kid

6734.0 --> 6739.44
they just like keep asking why and they

6736.239 --> 6743.839999999999
just grew annoyed and then i realized

6739.44 --> 6743.839999999999
why are you annoyed when i asked why

6744.08 --> 6746.8
well because it doesn't really lead to

6745.679 --> 6748.88
something

6746.8 --> 6753.52
then i figured out

6748.88 --> 6755.28
okay well then we just yeah then why am

6753.52 --> 6757.679
i asking why

6755.28 --> 6758.8
i have to ask myself is because i want

6757.679 --> 6760.0
to know

6758.8 --> 6761.92
what

6760.0 --> 6763.84
and how

6761.92 --> 6766.56
i figured this out like as a

6763.84 --> 6766.56
six-year-old

6766.96 --> 6771.719
on a pretty subconscious level

6770.159 --> 6774.48
and i want to like

6771.719 --> 6778.96
re-emphasize that

6774.48 --> 6781.678999999999
don't ask why ask what and how

6778.96 --> 6783.28
and you'll learn a whole bunch more

6781.679 --> 6786.0
whole much

6783.28 --> 6789.5199999999995
a whole bunch more

6786.0 --> 6789.52
than if you just ask why

6791.119 --> 6796.5599999999995
right why is an inquiry a lot of the

6793.84 --> 6798.0
time into motivation

6796.56 --> 6800.8
well what

6798.0 --> 6804.56
if you want to know how the motivation

6800.8 --> 6804.56
forced something to come into being

6804.84 --> 6809.84
then well you're going to end up with a

6808.32 --> 6812.32
lot of the times

6809.84 --> 6814.32
when people do things

6812.32 --> 6816.799999999999
their motivation isn't as

6814.32 --> 6819.679
straightforward set

6816.8 --> 6822.4800000000005
as you might assume

6819.679 --> 6824.719
would drive the action

6822.48 --> 6824.718999999999
right

6825.84 --> 6830.88
what motivation

6828.159 --> 6832.239
in your mind is set about why you did

6830.88 --> 6833.52
something

6832.239 --> 6836.239
afterward

6833.52 --> 6838.8
is often very different from the actual

6836.239 --> 6841.44
motivation that exists in the very

6838.8 --> 6844.719
moment of the action

6841.44 --> 6846.48
because people don't know why they do

6844.719 --> 6848.88
things

6846.48 --> 6851.36
in reality

6848.88 --> 6854.159000000001
they figure it out afterward it just

6851.36 --> 6857.119
happens to them a lot of the times their

6854.159 --> 6861.199
subconscious drives their actions

6857.119 --> 6862.799999999999
and their consciousness only follows

6861.199 --> 6864.32
i experienced this

6862.8 --> 6865.679
most experience

6864.32 --> 6869.28
that

6865.679 --> 6869.28
they just don't understand it

6870.239 --> 6874.959999999999
so i just wanted to

6873.04 --> 6877.84
say that for a moment

6874.96 --> 6881.679
don't ask why

6877.84 --> 6882.8
motivations are quite elusive in reality

6881.679 --> 6883.92
ask

6882.8 --> 6886.4800000000005
what

6883.92 --> 6889.4800000000005
and how and you'll learn a whole lot

6886.48 --> 6889.48
more

6892.0 --> 6896.56
what's the difference between fractal

6893.92 --> 6898.639
truth and regular truth

6896.56 --> 6902.080000000001
fractal truth

6898.639 --> 6904.88
applies to everything and will stand the

6902.08 --> 6907.92
test the time it will be subjected to

6904.88 --> 6910.719
entropy but it will live through the

6907.92 --> 6912.96
actual change of perspective

6910.719 --> 6914.719
that everybody subjected to

6912.96 --> 6916.88
throughout time

6914.719 --> 6919.679
that's fractal truth

6916.88 --> 6921.52
regular truth is contemporary it's

6919.679 --> 6924.88
something that is true

6921.52 --> 6926.320000000001
in a very specific way in that moment

6924.88 --> 6930.08
a fact

6926.32 --> 6931.36
for example is a regular truth

6930.08 --> 6933.76
because it's

6931.36 --> 6936.08
that's just true right that thing is

6933.76 --> 6937.360000000001
just true that's the data that's what

6936.08 --> 6939.28
happens

6937.36 --> 6943.5199999999995
fractal truth

6939.28 --> 6945.36
applies to more than just the thing

6943.52 --> 6947.84
that it is

6945.36 --> 6950.5599999999995
contextually mentioned with

6947.84 --> 6952.159000000001
that's fractal truth

6950.56 --> 6957.080000000001
hope that answers the question it's a

6952.159 --> 6957.08
very complicated question mind you

6963.04 --> 6967.119
right

6964.0 --> 6969.84
that's why for example jesus's teachings

6967.119 --> 6972.48
his direct words are fractal truth

6969.84 --> 6974.719
because they apply to everything

6972.48 --> 6977.199
always

6974.719 --> 6979.679
and if you find yourself being like

6977.199 --> 6982.08
it doesn't always apply then it actually

6979.679 --> 6985.679
does apply it does it's just the

6982.08 --> 6985.679
unwillingness as usual

6986.4 --> 6992.48
that prevents you from understanding it

6988.88 --> 6992.4800000000005
in the moment and rejecting it

6993.199 --> 6997.04
right most people even believe in jesus

6995.679 --> 7000.0
when they

6997.04 --> 7001.119
fully are pointed at the depth of its

7000.0 --> 7004.719
power

7001.119 --> 7007.44
they will have inner friction and then a

7004.719 --> 7009.119
little bit will try to reject it anyway

7007.44 --> 7012.239
that's natural

7009.119 --> 7015.04
jesus literally said that happens

7012.239 --> 7017.919999999999
the closer you get to god the heavier

7015.04 --> 7020.96
the truth the brighter the light the

7017.92 --> 7022.96
more will become your enemy

7020.96 --> 7025.92
the devil

7022.96 --> 7028.56
becomes too tempting to resist

7025.92 --> 7030.88
and this is not something that is even

7028.56 --> 7032.2390000000005
evil it's natural it happens it becomes

7030.88 --> 7035.28
too heavy

7032.239 --> 7038.839999999999
right a man can only carry so much

7035.28 --> 7038.84
weight in the moment

7046.48 --> 7051.04
please provide

7048.0 --> 7054.639
an example of a regular truth

7051.04 --> 7057.36
that has not stood the test of time

7054.639 --> 7059.84
well a whole bunch of philosophical

7057.36 --> 7059.839999999999
comparisons

7060.32 --> 7064.96
made by

7061.679 --> 7066.4
what were regarded as brilliant atheists

7064.96 --> 7068.2390000000005
at the time

7066.4 --> 7070.5599999999995
in the 20th century

7068.239 --> 7072.799999999999
it can't be specific i just know that

7070.56 --> 7074.719
applies it's things that i've heard that

7072.8 --> 7077.4400000000005
it was like oh you said that in an

7074.719 --> 7082.159
amazing way and it applies so well

7077.44 --> 7084.879999999999
but it only applies within that confined

7082.159 --> 7087.679
frame of thinking

7084.88 --> 7089.28
which i happened to be in at the time

7087.679 --> 7091.4400000000005
that's why it worked

7089.28 --> 7093.04
as soon as you change your angle of

7091.44 --> 7095.199
perspective

7093.04 --> 7098.4
as soon as you're not in that frame of

7095.199 --> 7101.839999999999
mind anymore then you see

7098.4 --> 7101.839999999999
that it doesn't work

7104.4 --> 7108.799999999999
right

7106.56 --> 7111.360000000001
the context

7108.8 --> 7115.04
that is highlighted in an example of

7111.36 --> 7116.639
something can be true from a certain

7115.04 --> 7118.32
perspective

7116.639 --> 7120.08
but if you then draw in all the

7118.32 --> 7123.28
perspectives

7120.08 --> 7124.8
including heavy opposition perspectives

7123.28 --> 7126.719
and it doesn't work anymore then it's

7124.8 --> 7129.92
not a fractal truth

7126.719 --> 7132.4
because a real fractal truth is true

7129.92 --> 7135.119
even to those that are in direct

7132.4 --> 7137.199
opposition of all of it

7135.119 --> 7139.44
that's the real fractal truth that's a

7137.199 --> 7142.799999999999
truth that literally just cannot be

7139.44 --> 7145.44
denied like it is physically impossible

7142.8 --> 7147.04
to do that

7145.44 --> 7150.759999999999
unless you just

7147.04 --> 7150.76
cut off the information

7160.88 --> 7166.28
correlates the core fact is still

7162.88 --> 7166.28
present yes

7176.8 --> 7182.8
right i hope you guys understand it is

7179.76 --> 7185.84
it is quite esoteric

7182.8 --> 7188.4800000000005
and i think it is a pretty freshly

7185.84 --> 7190.08
conjured concept even right to call it

7188.48 --> 7192.48
fractal

7190.08 --> 7195.36
fractal thinking fractal truth it is

7192.48 --> 7198.0
relatively new

7195.36 --> 7200.239
right in the 90s it might have been

7198.0 --> 7202.4
called through the

7200.239 --> 7205.04
alternative

7202.4 --> 7208.0
hippie sector whatever like oh

7205.04 --> 7210.639
fifth dimensional or ascension thinking

7208.0 --> 7212.48
right there was like more of a title

7210.639 --> 7214.639
entitlement

7212.48 --> 7217.119
associated with it or your special

7214.639 --> 7219.599
special boy designation it didn't

7217.119 --> 7223.199
actually emphasize

7219.599 --> 7224.4800000000005
what it is and why it works the way it

7223.199 --> 7227.04
does

7224.48 --> 7230.159
fractal thinking

7227.04 --> 7231.76
by the very nature of the description

7230.159 --> 7235.759999999999
does do that

7231.76 --> 7237.52
it's like self-explanatory

7235.76 --> 7238.56
foundationally

7237.52 --> 7241.119000000001
because

7238.56 --> 7242.88
why would there be a fractal in there

7241.119 --> 7244.96
what is a fractal

7242.88 --> 7246.719
well if you know about fractals then you

7244.96 --> 7249.04
know that a fractal is like a thing

7246.719 --> 7250.639
within a thing within a thing and it has

7249.04 --> 7251.92
like

7250.639 --> 7254.400000000001
depths

7251.92 --> 7256.56
patterns that just keep on going and

7254.4 --> 7258.799999999999
going and going

7256.56 --> 7261.360000000001
right

7258.8 --> 7263.52
and if you understand that then you

7261.36 --> 7266.719
already understand

7263.52 --> 7269.92
why fractal thinking is fractal thinking

7266.719 --> 7271.28
because it applies to everything

7269.92 --> 7275.08
always

7271.28 --> 7275.08
no matter the perspective

7303.199 --> 7308.239
you could also call it divine knowledge

7306.48 --> 7310.08
potentially

7308.239 --> 7312.638999999999
in the far past it was probably

7310.08 --> 7316.239
associated with that

7312.639 --> 7318.96
i've just given a more mechanically anal

7316.239 --> 7318.959999999999
analyzed

7320.0 --> 7323.8
description of it

7326.32 --> 7331.36
did you come up with the phrase fractal

7328.239 --> 7331.36
truth yes i did

7332.48 --> 7335.119
yes i did

7337.119 --> 7341.759999999999
i mean there might have been

7339.52 --> 7344.719
a thousand other people that roughly

7341.76 --> 7349.360000000001
during the same period came up with it

7344.719 --> 7351.119
but i never copied it from somebody else

7349.36 --> 7353.598999999999
i think it's like

7351.119 --> 7355.679
a while ago

7353.599 --> 7357.679
i think owen benjamin brought up

7355.679 --> 7360.159
fractals and how interesting they were

7357.679 --> 7362.8
and like

7360.159 --> 7364.719
the mandelbrot thing right and just how

7362.8 --> 7368.08
fascinating it is and just oh think

7364.719 --> 7371.36
about it and that's when i realized this

7368.08 --> 7373.679
is literally a separable thing

7371.36 --> 7375.679
and that's when i in response that

7373.679 --> 7376.96
inspired by the big bear in this case

7375.679 --> 7378.56
it's not the first time that i've

7376.96 --> 7380.4
actually engaged in watching and

7378.56 --> 7382.400000000001
studying fractals

7380.4 --> 7384.96
but that was the moment where i realized

7382.4 --> 7387.759999999999
wait this is a thing

7384.96 --> 7390.4800000000005
it's it's there it's not been named

7387.76 --> 7391.92
it's thr fractal thinking

7390.48 --> 7393.44
jesus did it

7391.92 --> 7394.4800000000005
it's the best of it

7393.44 --> 7396.159
best of us

7394.48 --> 7398.08
such an early time that he was able to

7396.159 --> 7401.28
do that

7398.08 --> 7403.44
and others can do it too i can do it

7401.28 --> 7406.48
i've kind of already been doing it for a

7403.44 --> 7409.919999999999
long time naturally like i've made it a

7406.48 --> 7413.04
habit for myself to do it like that

7409.92 --> 7413.04
to be that

7413.84 --> 7420.04
and not be bogged down

7416.8 --> 7420.04
by contemporarianism

7427.36 --> 7430.5599999999995
that might make a good title

7432.88 --> 7437.84
don't be bogged down

7443.84 --> 7447.1990000000005
just created a new word

7448.159 --> 7451.159
contemporaneous

7455.76 --> 7459.2390000000005
okay is it

7458.0 --> 7461.52
i like

7459.239 --> 7463.199
contemporarianism more though oh

7461.52 --> 7464.26
apparently

7463.199 --> 7466.079
contemporaneity

7464.26 --> 7468.8
[Music]

7466.079 --> 7471.599
is that there is that

7468.8 --> 7471.599
the real word

7474.719 --> 7479.079
let me try to google that

7494.48 --> 7498.239
yeah it's

7495.44 --> 7498.239
temporary

7499.599 --> 7503.1990000000005
i'm not gonna remember that word very

7501.52 --> 7506.4400000000005
well i'm probably gonna remember the

7503.199 --> 7506.44
other version

7514.239 --> 7520.598999999999
the version that doesn't actually exist

7516.159 --> 7520.598999999999
that i basically made out of it

7525.119 --> 7529.92
did you come up with the resurrect

7526.719 --> 7529.92
fractal truth yeah

7530.079 --> 7533.88
i already answered that

7545.119 --> 7549.839999999999
yes steamy traveler you get it

7550.8 --> 7554.8
fractal truth is more genius than the

7552.96 --> 7557.52
looping earth but the looping earth is a

7554.8 --> 7560.2390000000005
concept it's a concept based on what

7557.52 --> 7562.88
could potentially be possible

7560.239 --> 7565.36
chipping away at just the typical

7562.88 --> 7568.639
conventional way of thinking

7565.36 --> 7570.32
looping earth is simply unconventional

7568.639 --> 7573.52
that's what it is

7570.32 --> 7574.84
fractal truth is a freaking

7573.52 --> 7576.4800000000005
important

7574.84 --> 7580.0
thing

7576.48 --> 7580.0
it's really important

7580.48 --> 7586.0
it was always important

7583.84 --> 7589.32
i just gave it a name

7586.0 --> 7589.32
that's all

7599.51 --> 7604.319
[Applause]

7622.079 --> 7625.079
uh

7634.88 --> 7639.52
right by the way you have to realize

7636.719 --> 7641.36
though that their fractal truth is not

7639.52 --> 7642.639
infinite

7641.36 --> 7645.36
it's just

7642.639 --> 7647.4400000000005
wide right

7645.36 --> 7652.719
at certain levels everything the

7647.44 --> 7654.799999999999
cohesion will eventually start to falter

7652.719 --> 7657.52
i've never seen anything

7654.8 --> 7659.76
that it had i've never seen fractal

7657.52 --> 7662.320000000001
thinking that does not have limitations

7659.76 --> 7662.320000000001
in ways

7663.28 --> 7669.44
but the thing is is that it can mean

7666.56 --> 7671.84
just so much more beyond the

7669.44 --> 7674.879999999999
contemporary

7671.84 --> 7678.0
and that's its power is that

7674.88 --> 7679.679
the value of such things such

7678.0 --> 7683.92
information

7679.679 --> 7685.52
lasts beyond a trivial moment

7683.92 --> 7689.719
it makes

7685.52 --> 7689.719
information valuable

7695.36 --> 7698.839999999999
hey that's 368.

7727.599 --> 7731.84
i think i'm gonna round out the show

7734.88 --> 7738.679
it had some good moments

7754.56 --> 7756.88
he

7756.96 --> 7759.84
got another paypal

7760.8 --> 7766.56
not sure from who but thank you

7764.0 --> 7766.56
five bucks

7771.76 --> 7778.2390000000005
please keep it coming

7774.48 --> 7781.119
yeah so before i go i want to emphasize

7778.239 --> 7783.598999999999
again i am really in need of financial

7781.119 --> 7787.679
assistance

7783.599 --> 7790.8
10 euros all together is is cool

7787.679 --> 7794.0
it's really not enough though

7790.8 --> 7795.92
i don't want to be whiny pants about it

7794.0 --> 7799.04
it isn't

7795.92 --> 7800.96
i need more support

7799.04 --> 7805.44
i watched simon that interview with

7800.96 --> 7805.44
randy oh god really when did that happen

7808.32 --> 7811.759999999999
is that a recent thing he did

7812.639 --> 7816.96
right

7815.28 --> 7818.239
anyway

7816.96 --> 7821.119
i really need

7818.239 --> 7823.759999999999
the financial support through paypal

7821.119 --> 7826.4
i mean yeah literally if everybody

7823.76 --> 7828.96
that's watched my show and appreciated

7826.4 --> 7831.5199999999995
and learned something from it

7828.96 --> 7835.04
would donate five euros like on a daily

7831.52 --> 7836.400000000001
basis yeah i'd be out of trouble quickly

7835.04 --> 7839.599
unfortunately

7836.4 --> 7839.598999999999
that's not what's happening

7840.239 --> 7845.839999999999
some people give me some some of the

7843.36 --> 7849.44
time and then there are some

7845.84 --> 7851.84
more yeah more close-up followers

7849.44 --> 7853.839999999999
that have a little more room for

7851.84 --> 7857.4400000000005
expenditures

7853.84 --> 7860.0
that do support me but yeah

7857.44 --> 7862.719
all together it's still kind of not

7860.0 --> 7863.599
enough and i don't like saying that at

7862.719 --> 7865.679
all

7863.599 --> 7869.719
because i am really appreciating the

7865.679 --> 7869.719
support that i do get

7870.96 --> 7876.159
i just can't emphasize enough please

7873.52 --> 7879.119000000001
support me through the paypal i'm really

7876.159 --> 7879.119
in need of that

7882.4 --> 7886.5599999999995
i mean

7884.48 --> 7887.36
remember the formula

7886.56 --> 7888.56
like

7887.36 --> 7892.079
focusing

7888.56 --> 7894.159000000001
on what i do the level

7892.079 --> 7897.599
that i do it with

7894.159 --> 7901.04
it requires that focus right

7897.599 --> 7904.8
money problems is really in my way it

7901.04 --> 7908.32
disrupts my daily

7904.8 --> 7911.28
peaceful frame of mind

7908.32 --> 7913.44
and also disrupts therefore the

7911.28 --> 7915.759999999999
concentration that i can conjure up

7913.44 --> 7917.678999999999
during the shows which i use the rest of

7915.76 --> 7919.360000000001
the day for to do

7917.679 --> 7922.56
when i dream walk

7919.36 --> 7924.88
i'm basically condensing everything

7922.56 --> 7927.360000000001
i'm refining i'm like an information

7924.88 --> 7929.36
refinery all day long

7927.36 --> 7932.4
i feel like a piece of industrial

7929.36 --> 7935.119
equipment in the form of a brain

7932.4 --> 7938.638999999999
that just does that

7935.119 --> 7943.119
and it requires financial maintenance

7938.639 --> 7943.119
i'm very serious i really need that

7944.0 --> 7948.079
right

7945.36 --> 7950.719
i can't do it otherwise i can't keep

7948.079 --> 7952.5599999999995
doing this

7950.719 --> 7956.4800000000005
if i don't get

7952.56 --> 7959.1990000000005

animal talk

8019.599 --> 8025.360000000001
amazing creatures out there and their

8021.84 --> 8028.639
habits and their differences and their

8025.36 --> 8031.28
psychologies and their inner spirits and

8028.639 --> 8033.36
social differences it's all quite

8031.28 --> 8034.88
fascinating to me
