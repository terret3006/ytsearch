talk about it's kind of hard to now step

163.72 --> 169.33
away from from the other subjects was

167.02 --> 172.96
very heavy I have been thinking of maybe

169.33 --> 175.21
delving into the path of Christ because

172.96 --> 177.01000000000002
that is kind of a subject that I always

175.21 --> 179.26000000000002
yeah that I've been wanted to share with

177.01 --> 181.20999999999998
you from the start and I think that you

179.26 --> 186.19
think very similarly also has to do with

181.21 --> 188.26000000000002
what we were talking about and yeah what

186.19 --> 195.04
what do you know about it when have you

188.26 --> 197.14
heard from it it being the path the

195.04 --> 199.09
concept of the path and the the

197.14 --> 204.91
teachings of Rudolf Steiner

199.09 --> 211.54
I haven't delved into that at all no

204.91 --> 217.62
okay my my experiences have been

211.54 --> 220.79999999999998
entirely through scriptures and life

217.62 --> 225.82
through challenges and finding my way

220.8 --> 227.89000000000001
being led really testing things out

225.82 --> 233.88
finding out what worked and what didn't

227.89 --> 233.88
work and it's brought me to this point

235.08 --> 238.08
okay

238.3 --> 242.93
sorry I'm gonna be working for like five

241.34 --> 243.53
minutes in the background to get this

242.93 --> 244.97
fixed

243.53 --> 246.77
I'm so sorry these kind of

244.97 --> 250.06
unprofessional I should have done this

246.77 --> 253.70000000000002
before but just for an update I had to

250.06 --> 256.07
have a thousand and sixteen subscribers

253.7 --> 258.17
at the moment I'd left it yeah it's

256.07 --> 260.75
pretty good it says it hasn't gone down

258.17 --> 264.77000000000004
to a thousand for a while now so it's

260.75 --> 267.97
nice but I'm gonna have to get this

264.77 --> 267.96999999999997
fixed how do I do this

268.53 --> 276.05999999999995
all right right right there you go shout

271.29 --> 280.64000000000004

sis

286.77 --> 294.83
there you go mm-hmm how do rune Hey

298.44 --> 302.4
the atom meek and the one and only hi

301.65 --> 310.13
cuz

302.4 --> 310.13
yes is there okay Steve Steve the quiet

310.94 --> 324.09
the quiet presence so yeah well the path

321.0 --> 329.19
I'll just explain it quickly the concept

324.09 --> 331.28999999999996
is I'm still learning though but it

329.19 --> 334.85
basically comes down to the path the

331.29 --> 339.12
narrow path of Christ is the middle road

334.85 --> 342.41
where on one side there is the seduction

339.12 --> 346.229
of Lucifer of the bright light of the

342.41 --> 351.87
the mania and then on the other side

346.229 --> 357.3
there is the seduction or the the Mesmer

351.87 --> 363.34000000000003
of the of Ahriman the the darkness the

357.3 --> 366.52000000000004
destroyer welding yeah the the eraser

363.34 --> 371.97999999999996
the forgetfulness and the depression and

366.52 --> 374.71
that yet those two are the elements the

371.98 --> 376.78000000000003
spiritual elements that can hinder you

374.71 --> 379.51
from walking that careful middle path

376.78 --> 384.52
that is the right way to do things and

379.51 --> 389.07
to progress spiritually and the world

384.52 --> 392.71
constantly presents these two types of

389.07 --> 394.59999999999997
well distractions and seductions irani

392.71 --> 396.87
and they come through you through other

394.6 --> 399.55
people that have also been seduced

396.87 --> 400.93
because everybody gets it and it's very

399.55 --> 403.51
hard to resist

400.93 --> 407.05
you can probably resist it up to some

403.51 --> 408.76
level but then you'll get you grow in to

407.05 --> 411.28000000000003
a new level and you have to learn to

408.76 --> 413.46999999999997
resist it all over again on that level

411.28 --> 415.57
and that's very tough and a lot of

413.47 --> 419.56
people just give up they just give in

415.57 --> 423.61
and then they will be recipients for

419.56 --> 427.24
that spirit and others that tend to go

423.61 --> 430.6
beyond those people spiritually they

427.24 --> 432.1
will arouse certain conflicts in these

430.6 --> 434.38
people that have been seduced and

432.1 --> 437.5
through them they will channel the

434.38 --> 440.56
spirits of Ahriman and Lucifer to try

437.5 --> 442.78
and stop these others so you literally

440.56 --> 446.2
become part of that spiritual system

442.78 --> 448.59999999999997
those systems those those two and they

446.2 --> 452.02
are opponents but there are also allies

448.6 --> 455.29
against Christ against the true middle

452.02 --> 460.96
path that the true purpose the design

455.29 --> 469.15000000000003
for human individuals so in my

460.96 --> 472.14
understanding again in in studying the

469.15 --> 477.78999999999996
Scriptures which includes all the

472.14 --> 479.5
apocryphal stuff and coming to an

477.79 --> 482.35
understanding of what Christ was about

479.5 --> 487.57
and I mean the Christ because there are

482.35 --> 491.59000000000003
many it is a title but the one that was

487.57 --> 496.11
promised and showed up and and has led

491.59 --> 500.32
us and told us what the path is

496.11 --> 507.27000000000004
came to understand the strategies of how

500.32 --> 512.4
to resist and how to avoid you know

507.27 --> 516.4789999999999
falling in with or agreeing with and

512.4 --> 521.86
giving room to the dark side yes

516.479 --> 526.63
so even Star Wars kind of gives us hints

521.86 --> 531.51
but it's like sick it's deceptive as

526.63 --> 536.14
well so the secret is to work on oneself

531.51 --> 539.89
to eliminate any territory any spiritual

536.14 --> 544.66
territory within us that that gives

539.89 --> 548.23
foothold to the dark side and Christ is

544.66 --> 553.0899999999999
the path to doing that as we get washed

548.23 --> 557.38
out cleansed of all the garbage that

553.09 --> 559.7800000000001
we've been indoctrinated with and as we

557.38 --> 563.8
arrive to the kernel of truth the

559.78 --> 568.9
essence of truth that is our path to

563.8 --> 572.17
life eternal and free so yes that in a

568.9 --> 574.78
nutshell but it touches every area of

572.17 --> 577.4799999999999
our lives every little hidden thing even

574.78 --> 580.36
our thoughts that we think nobody can

577.48 --> 584.6700000000001
see they are being seen they are being

580.36 --> 589.0
felt and every thought leads to

584.67 --> 592.63
attitudes into actions and habits and so

589.0 --> 595.21
we're told can take every thought

592.63 --> 600.85
captive to the throne and that's what

595.21 --> 603.9100000000001
that means is to to be mmm to hold every

600.85 --> 607.0
thought accountable you know check it

603.91 --> 612.01
don't don't just let it run wild take it

607.0 --> 612.43
to the standard take it to the to the

612.01 --> 616.15
source

612.43 --> 619.6899999999999
literally and don't allow it to reside

616.15 --> 623.55
in you don't allow it to have seeds and

619.69 --> 626.3800000000001
roots and fruiting in your life yes

623.55 --> 629.2489999999999
until it's checked and you know for

626.38 --> 633.3389999999999
goodness and go from there

629.249 --> 635.619
yeah they planned this another very

633.339 --> 641.619
essential principle is the judge not

635.619 --> 645.0400000000001
it's it's not that we don't examine and

641.619 --> 648.129
don't draw conclusions of what is right

645.04 --> 651.129
or wrong or good or bad we're supposed

648.129 --> 653.559
to do that that is the whole thing about

651.129 --> 655.839
having the knowledge of good and evil

653.559 --> 658.749
and understanding it we need to make

655.839 --> 662.11
choices for ourselves but when we act as

658.749 --> 664.749
judges of other individuals we're

662.11 --> 667.509
placing ourselves in a position that we

664.749 --> 670.9490000000001
were not designed to be in it's someone

667.509 --> 674.29
else's job so when we take on that job

670.949 --> 676.269
there are effects and results not just

674.29 --> 679.389
any other person's life but in our own

676.269 --> 682.99
and that is the secret about that that

679.389 --> 686.199
when we judge others and condemn them we

682.99 --> 688.42
it ends up reflecting back on us we end

686.199 --> 693.04
up participating in the judgement and

688.42 --> 695.4699999999999
that's an axiom that is even in

693.04 --> 699.069
witchcraft they you know they call it

695.47 --> 701.139
when the when the spell falls back on

699.069 --> 703.569
you when it comes back on you yeah oh

701.139 --> 712.439
it's even declared in physics every

703.569 --> 718.079
action has an opposite and equal yes

712.439 --> 721.809
there's that every word is a seed every

718.079 --> 725.2589999999999
truth or lie that is told is a seed and

721.809 --> 727.24
it has the cake the capacity of growing

725.259 --> 730.509
into something huge and that's what I

727.24 --> 733.779
mean about making a ripple it can become

730.509 --> 736.569
a tsunami for good or for bad but there

733.779 --> 742.509
is someone above all and even the bad

736.569 --> 746.61
stuff gets rained in and bound and the

742.509 --> 752.009
good gets released so it's part of the

746.61 --> 755.86
elements of the design yes and is there

752.009 --> 759.09
it is accounted for that is obviously

755.86 --> 763.54
the design accounts for this

759.09 --> 767.2900000000001
uh-huh and then there's the conflict

763.54 --> 769.63
like why really and yeah I guess the

767.29 --> 771.87
Bible talks a lot about that as well but

769.63 --> 774.64
it's still one of the more difficult

771.87 --> 779.32
obstacles for many individuals to

774.64 --> 783.6999999999999
overcome including myself who's like why

779.32 --> 786.36
can't it all just work out why can't it

783.7 --> 792.07
be easier well because it's not

786.36 --> 797.02
necessarily be easier but at least I'm

792.07 --> 800.7700000000001
just not so grim I guess you know yeah

797.02 --> 802.68
but it's it's it's if it wasn't there

800.77 --> 804.85
then they wouldn't recognize it I do

802.68 --> 806.77
philosophically understand it no but

804.85 --> 809.95
still from the perspective of a person

806.77 --> 812.89
as I am now as I think now in a certain

809.95 --> 815.6800000000001
moment it is very difficult to grasp but

812.89 --> 820.75
when you look at it objectively then

815.68 --> 824.17
yeah I can understand but it's my person

820.75 --> 826.99
I get maybe it's my ego I guess it's

824.17 --> 831.9
that counter response it's always a

826.99 --> 834.46
struggle with that the Distilled

831.9 --> 838.24
understanding or inner standing whatever

834.46 --> 841.1800000000001
outer standing the Distilled standing my

838.24 --> 847.24
perspective is again it's either life or

841.18 --> 849.76
death those are the choices right that's

847.24 --> 854.41
what it boils down to eventually yeah

849.76 --> 857.4399999999999
and it's it's a long road for us to

854.41 --> 859.9599999999999
understand what life truly is and what

857.44 --> 863.71
it means and what death Julie is it what

859.96 --> 867.8100000000001
it means and and always the daily

863.71 --> 872.95
choices between what seems convenient or

867.81 --> 877.0799999999999
okay at the moment might in retrospect

872.95 --> 881.23
go oh that's where I messed up so it's

877.08 --> 883.2700000000001
it's a constant choosing and a constant

881.23 --> 884.86
growth and if you're not growing if

883.27 --> 887.59
you're stagnant you're going backwards

884.86 --> 890.76
it's just because life keeps moving on

887.59 --> 890.76
it keeps flowing and

891.32 --> 898.88
you know it's a challenge every day

894.08 --> 901.73
every moment it's a challenge I can

898.88 --> 902.42
choose to lose my temper or I can temper

901.73 --> 908.33
myself

902.42 --> 912.14
yes yeah I agree I don't know if you

908.33 --> 914.4200000000001
have if you struggle with like strong

912.14 --> 921.55
emotions some people do that I kind of

914.42 --> 925.0699999999999
do that it's not always a thing

921.55 --> 927.8299999999999
everybody has like upset periods yeah

925.07 --> 930.9200000000001
just go on tilt but it's not the same as

927.83 --> 934.34
people who really feel very deeply and

930.92 --> 936.92
sensitive and everything yeah it's kind

934.34 --> 939.2900000000001
of sounds but everything hurts them more

936.92 --> 943.8499999999999
than the average person because they see

939.29 --> 951.13
more of it yeah and are you like that as

943.85 --> 953.84
well or I I I guess I go through phases

951.13 --> 955.79
right now I'm at a very stable phase

953.84 --> 961.0400000000001
only because I don't want things phase

955.79 --> 963.02
me but when the when the hard times come

961.04 --> 966.4399999999999
when the upheaval is happening because

963.02 --> 969.89
things are having to change for example

966.44 --> 972.0500000000001
when I I i had a very strong impression

969.89 --> 976.4
that i wasn't going to be staying in

972.05 --> 979.52
florida and things just were headed in a

976.4 --> 987.29
way to be leaving and even though I had

979.52 --> 988.31
a wonderful fiance and and a whole life

987.29 --> 991.88
ahead of me

988.31 --> 995.3299999999999
I knew in my heart I was not going to be

991.88 --> 999.83
staying and when he understood that too

995.33 --> 1003.0300000000001
and I said guess what I I had asked I

999.83 --> 1006.37
told him I had asked God for three signs

1003.03 --> 1008.8
when it was time to go it there was no

1006.37 --> 1011.47
question that I was going or not he knew

1008.8 --> 1013.54
it and I knew it and when I told him I

1011.47 --> 1015.49
got my third sign he just hugged me and

1013.54 --> 1017.74
said we knew that we knew this day would

1015.49 --> 1021.76
come and he he says I wish you didn't

1017.74 --> 1023.86
have to go but I see that you do and we

1021.76 --> 1025.12
tried to maintain the relationship even

1023.86 --> 1028.15
across the distance but

1025.12 --> 1031.87
became very clear that not only did I

1028.15 --> 1034.449
need to get out of that he also needed

1031.87 --> 1039.9699999999998
to get out of that and it was after I

1034.449 --> 1042.22
left and and he kept trying to rekindle

1039.97 --> 1046.659
and try to get me to come back to

1042.22 --> 1051.49
Florida that I flat smacked him there

1046.659 --> 1055.0590000000002
you go and three conversations about an

1051.49 --> 1059.11
hour long each and the next conversation

1055.059 --> 1061.3899999999999
I had with him he gets me on the phone

1059.11 --> 1069.4289999999999
and I said hey how you doing he goes oh

1061.39 --> 1072.789
my god it's flat and I let him run with

1069.429 --> 1075.159
it because I don't micromanage I I just

1072.789 --> 1077.32
gave him some pointers and he went

1075.159 --> 1082.75
looking on his own which I'm very proud

1077.32 --> 1084.58
that he did and every now and then he'll

1082.75 --> 1086.77
call me because he needs someone to talk

1084.58 --> 1089.1589999999999
to like any of us do

1086.77 --> 1094.3799999999999
he doesn't have anyone that he knows

1089.159 --> 1097.8700000000001
down there that he can talk to openly or

1094.38 --> 1102.5800000000002
frankly about any of this he's fully

1097.87 --> 1104.799
aware that there are opposing forces and

1102.58 --> 1108.34
that they're prevalent everywhere he

1104.799 --> 1110.679
looks so of course he wanted someone to

1108.34 --> 1114.37
talk to and every now and then he'll

1110.679 --> 1121.26
call me say so what's going on Wow so

1114.37 --> 1127.649
you still do have the blessing of being

1121.26 --> 1131.74
able to rebuild bridges with people who

1127.649 --> 1134.32
have been in my life and who at some

1131.74 --> 1137.74
point got either moved away or removed

1134.32 --> 1138.46
not death wise I don't I don't speak to

1137.74 --> 1146.73
dead people

1138.46 --> 1154.0
no but the nearest I come to that was

1146.73 --> 1157.57
one of my babies was stillborn and I had

1154.0 --> 1162.34
a conversation my Maker and as

1157.57 --> 1166.47
to relay a message and my answer was he

1162.34 --> 1169.1689999999999
knows and that was telling me it's a boy

1166.47 --> 1172.8700000000001
oh wow

1169.169 --> 1176.23
but anyway I have have many stories many

1172.87 --> 1178.6299999999999
life experiences many things and I

1176.23 --> 1180.99
always would check back with the

1178.63 --> 1184.5400000000002
Scriptures to make sure I wasn't just

1180.99 --> 1186.91
dreaming things up and you know having

1184.54 --> 1190.36
hallucinations that were Pleasant or

1186.91 --> 1194.23
whatever or even bad ones as a

1190.36 --> 1197.2299999999998
ten-year-old my father was teaching

1194.23 --> 1201.3600000000001
seminary so there were these college

1197.23 --> 1205.99
level and Beyond people joining and

1201.36 --> 1208.1499999999999
getting in depth understanding of the

1205.99 --> 1209.89
Scriptures homiletics and all this other

1208.15 --> 1215.23
stuff so that they could they could

1209.89 --> 1219.0400000000002
teach others in their churches and at

1215.23 --> 1222.82
ten years old he says we're gonna be

1219.04 --> 1225.73
taking a test while we're at this

1222.82 --> 1228.46
retreat and I'd like you to take it

1225.73 --> 1231.13
along with my students and I'm like what

1228.46 --> 1233.5
are you kidding me

1231.13 --> 1235.7800000000002
and I stopped there and I took the test

1233.5 --> 1240.669
it told me what to study which was

1235.78 --> 1243.22
revelations chapters 10 through 12 and I

1240.669 --> 1245.44
read it and read it and read it and then

1243.22 --> 1251.41
when the time the day of the test came I

1245.44 --> 1253.69
I did pretty well apparently but the

1251.41 --> 1256.27
result or a side effect of that was I

1253.69 --> 1258.429
started having a recurring I have to

1256.27 --> 1261.46
call it a nightmare but it was literally

1258.429 --> 1264.52
outfit of vision but it was only when I

1261.46 --> 1266.8600000000001
was sleeping it wasn't a big engine or

1264.52 --> 1270.03
something right right and it was pretty

1266.86 --> 1270.03
scary so

1271.72 --> 1276.6390000000001
that shouldn't but I'd love to hear more

1274.419 --> 1279.8400000000001
about it because yeah I've been talking

1276.639 --> 1282.99
about very similar sounding experiences

1279.84 --> 1286.9599999999998
which I refer to as division experiences

1282.99 --> 1290.889
that also yeah but which I think were

1286.96 --> 1292.99
probably at night look that happened

1290.889 --> 1295.75
while I was asleep but it just didn't

1292.99 --> 1297.34
feel like I was asleep and afterward it

1295.75 --> 1299.799
would feel like there would be a time of

1297.34 --> 1303.789
period that would just be in between and

1299.799 --> 1306.25
I couldn't place it like you can it's

1303.789 --> 1309.519
just perfectly real it was perfectly

1306.25 --> 1311.71
real to me and the experience itself but

1309.519 --> 1315.09
I can't really figure out how I came

1311.71 --> 1319.179
there and how I went away to this point

1315.09 --> 1324.509
that kind of thing was it kind of like

1319.179 --> 1334.45
that as well or it seemed to be yes very

1324.509 --> 1336.94
realistic involved watching people in a

1334.45 --> 1340.96
panic in a command and an utter

1336.94 --> 1344.5
commotion of the earth things falling

1340.96 --> 1347.679
apart things being shaken and the ground

1344.5 --> 1351.82
opening up you know a chasm people

1347.679 --> 1354.929
falling in and to the point of one

1351.82 --> 1358.21
mother holding a baby trying to you know

1354.929 --> 1360.3400000000001
saying someone please catch my baby and

1358.21 --> 1364.21
wanting to throw it up you know so

1360.34 --> 1366.9399999999998
someone could catch things like that and

1364.21 --> 1371.919
and hey I'm a child I'm like oh my god

1366.94 --> 1376.23
Wow and and a whole series of things and

1371.919 --> 1380.3990000000001
then the end was I'm watching someone

1376.23 --> 1383.98
coming forward out of the sky you know

1380.399 --> 1387.0089999999998
towards us and glorious and I'm like

1383.98 --> 1392.59
okay so I'm this has got to be related

1387.009 --> 1394.3890000000001
to Revelation but it kept referring it

1392.59 --> 1396.22
was recurring for quite some time and I

1394.389 --> 1400.1399999999999
still remember a lot of it though I had

1396.22 --> 1403.289
know some details that been

1400.14 --> 1407.25
erased so to speak that I'd I I can

1403.289 --> 1409.669
still sense the emotions and the the

1407.25 --> 1409.669
utter

1410.059 --> 1420.149
loss and troubled you know over the ones

1415.59 --> 1425.9089999999999
that were being who were dying right in

1420.149 --> 1430.86
front of me yeah not fun

1425.909 --> 1431.49
no I I've seen many of these type of

1430.86 --> 1434.4599999999998
dreams

1431.49 --> 1437.909
and they were very surreal and as I

1434.46 --> 1441.929
remember these dreams I recognized the

1437.909 --> 1444.1490000000001
people as I meet them look in real life

1441.929 --> 1446.519
and I even taught some of them like oh

1444.149 --> 1448.9189999999999
my god I remember you from this it was

1446.519 --> 1451.44
terrifying they were suggesting this and

1448.919 --> 1455.8200000000002
this was gonna happen to you and these

1451.44 --> 1459.179
guys are like okay well don't worry

1455.82 --> 1463.6789999999999
about that we have faith in this or yeah

1459.179 --> 1466.3500000000001
it was mainly like the two guys that

1463.679 --> 1471.24
helped me out of like one a very serious

1466.35 --> 1474.269
moment right here before I yeah I was

1471.24 --> 1477.84
big a couple of years ago now when yeah

1474.269 --> 1480.32
I was literally seeing starting to see

1477.84 --> 1483.51
hallucination things in broad daylight

1480.32 --> 1486.72
just very bad starting to hear things

1483.51 --> 1490.32
yeah I was going nuts but there in a

1486.72 --> 1492.8990000000001
specific way it was really related to

1490.32 --> 1495.299
these vision things that was the scary

1492.899 --> 1498.09
part it was not just some random weirdo

1495.299 --> 1500.279
thing like a typical drug-induced is

1498.09 --> 1501.99
this standard weird thing you know it

1500.279 --> 1505.44
was very specific and that's what's so

1501.99 --> 1507.99
scary about it and what they wanted from

1505.44 --> 1510.659
me but yeah I went over there and

1507.99 --> 1513.36
basically asked like yeah I'm not I

1510.659 --> 1514.98
don't think I'm a Christian I try if

1513.36 --> 1516.4499999999998
they try to be good but can you please

1514.98 --> 1518.49
help because you do a blessing or

1516.45 --> 1520.71
whatever I'll surrender because I can't

1518.49 --> 1521.63
handle this anymore and they did a lay

1520.71 --> 1525.1100000000001
on hands

1521.63 --> 1527.8700000000001
and it works I haven't had that level of

1525.11 --> 1531.1999999999998
hallucination since and these were just

1527.87 --> 1533.87
Mormon guys they were 10 years younger

1531.2 --> 1535.91
than me even then they weren't they just

1533.87 --> 1538.1
did it and it was right and I felt these

1535.91 --> 1541.13
people that have never really dealt with

1538.1 --> 1544.2199999999998
before and yeah I decided to go to this

1541.13 --> 1546.5300000000002
church and I've been there for years and

1544.22 --> 1549.83
now recently it kind of stopped going

1546.53 --> 1551.3899999999999
because just it changed they rebuilt

1549.83 --> 1553.6999999999998
stuff and it doesn't feel right anymore

1551.39 --> 1555.919
they now don't have a piano and I miss

1553.7 --> 1557.8400000000001
that and now they use an organ and I

1555.919 --> 1562.1000000000001
don't like the sound of that thing just

1557.84 --> 1564.02
does the same yeah and but I still have

1562.1 --> 1565.8799999999999
fond memories and ideas I will

1564.02 --> 1569.45
absolutely be nice to them and I will

1565.88 --> 1574.5490000000002
remember just how this culture is it's

1569.45 --> 1579.5
very special but yeah they helped me

1574.549 --> 1581.72
with that and I told them like in yeah

1579.5 --> 1583.789
after this relief is just a lot of this

1581.72 --> 1585.559
vision that which had been just piled on

1583.789 --> 1588.11
my consciousness all of a sudden out of

1585.559 --> 1590.33
nowhere and that caused me to loosen and

1588.11 --> 1592.1899999999998
all this crap and get paranoid they

1590.33 --> 1593.539
started to get more clearly back to me

1592.19 --> 1596.929
and I even said like oh my god I

1593.539 --> 1598.9089999999999
remember you I've seen you and there's

1596.929 --> 1600.679
somebody else that I'm gonna meet here

1598.909 --> 1602.8090000000002
in like a couple of weeks and I've seen

1600.679 --> 1605.15
his home on the inside just told him how

1602.809 --> 1608.24
these things and they were like wow and

1605.15 --> 1610.64
it all happened well may I all met all

1608.24 --> 1615.73
these people I have met I recognized all

1610.64 --> 1618.89
the faces and also some things happened

1615.73 --> 1620.69
that I'm absolutely damn sure are

1618.89 --> 1622.4
probably never gonna happen in the real

1620.69 --> 1625.46
world because that will be completely

1622.4 --> 1627.71
maniacal like people being murdered in

1625.46 --> 1629.299
in plain sight and that kind of thing

1627.71 --> 1632.69
that just doesn't make any freaking

1629.299 --> 1634.6399999999999
sense you know so I hope that doesn't

1632.69 --> 1638.029
actually happen that would be a very

1634.64 --> 1640.0700000000002
dark time but not just for

1638.029 --> 1642.739
my experience but for the entire world

1640.07 --> 1643.82
that kind of thing is just gonna start

1642.739 --> 1649.3690000000001
to happen like that

1643.82 --> 1653.029
but yeah that's the way I got my visions

1649.369 --> 1655.7289999999998
back pretty much I just it I went

1653.029 --> 1659.69
through a long period of amnesia then

1655.729 --> 1664.789
kind of flat earth in 2050 roughly we

1659.69 --> 1667.6390000000001
approached me and I literally now

1664.789 --> 1670.339
remember that the Dark One's in my

1667.639 --> 1673.6999999999998
visions were like very focused on

1670.339 --> 1675.559
threatening me mortally about it they

1673.7 --> 1679.789
were insistent like if you deal with

1675.559 --> 1682.479
this then you will die there's no way

1679.789 --> 1685.429
around it and yeah I've always been

1682.479 --> 1687.6090000000002
especially young was very afraid of

1685.429 --> 1691.789
death so that panicked me a great deal

1687.609 --> 1695.239
but yeah I don't know it just it just

1691.789 --> 1697.279
happened you know in my experience on

1695.239 --> 1698.479
the other side it's almost like wow what

1697.279 --> 1700.399
does this is interesting and they were

1698.479 --> 1702.409
like oh you did it now you're gonna die

1700.399 --> 1703.9689999999998
and I was like what oh but I didn't even

1702.409 --> 1707.0590000000002
know what I didn't choose this or

1703.969 --> 1709.729
something it wasn't like oh yeah this is

1707.059 --> 1712.879
my decision no it just happened and

1709.729 --> 1715.519
after that point a lot of things change

1712.879 --> 1718.599
I also discovered from the memories that

1715.519 --> 1721.969
came after that that they are actually

1718.599 --> 1725.749
weakened by certain words and concepts

1721.969 --> 1727.94
like Christ a fear it it hurts them and

1725.749 --> 1729.799
there are other words as will other

1727.94 --> 1731.539
words and other languages

1729.799 --> 1733.549
it's very vastly I've learned quite a

1731.539 --> 1736.489
lot I have got quite a library of

1733.549 --> 1738.289
certain you could call it spells but

1736.489 --> 1741.229
they're actually spells all the lights

1738.289 --> 1742.999
just words and meanings that the dark

1741.229 --> 1745.549
ones can't handle it because it opposes

1742.999 --> 1749.57
their essence disrupts their frequency

1745.549 --> 1752.389
and it works in the waking world and it

1749.57 --> 1754.609
works in the dark world as well and I

1752.389 --> 1757.82
basically started directly opposing them

1754.609 --> 1760.82
even though as I went through all that I

1757.82 --> 1763.1589999999999
was writing their narrative illusion

1760.82 --> 1766.399
that I started out completely believing

1763.159 --> 1768.0590000000002
and then just rebelled and this happened

1766.399 --> 1770.1589999999999
all of this

1768.059 --> 1772.049
and I'm not really sure where it really

1770.159 --> 1775.3790000000001
goes because after that point the

1772.049 --> 1778.08
visions got caught off and the last time

1775.379 --> 1781.769
I have a memory of an actual vision I

1778.08 --> 1784.499
was in 2013 which was basically under

1781.769 --> 1787.259
threat again out of nowhere like you

1784.499 --> 1792.479
must do this or you're gonna die very

1787.259 --> 1795.33
freaky and they showed I was like given

1792.479 --> 1796.6190000000001
a short film like a holographic film in

1795.33 --> 1799.2289999999998
front of me like yeah what's gonna

1796.619 --> 1801.059
happen okay here look at the politics

1799.229 --> 1803.6090000000002
stuff oh there's gonna be like a media

1801.059 --> 1806.1589999999999
war in the info wars and Trump Hillary

1803.609 --> 1807.779
and all that and it's gonna just go nuts

1806.159 --> 1809.909
and everybody's gonna go nuts and

1807.779 --> 1813.659
there's gonna be like rioting in the

1809.909 --> 1815.519
streets of these so calls all right and

1813.659 --> 1817.529
the what they called the Dark One's

1815.519 --> 1820.979
called them the Nazi it's very typical

1817.529 --> 1823.739
yeah just shows who these people in the

1820.979 --> 1825.839
real world are a light a light they are

1823.739 --> 1828.8690000000001
surrendered to these entities to these

1825.839 --> 1833.639
dark spirits and after that it's like

1828.869 --> 1838.649
and nothing else and I was like no no

1833.639 --> 1840.4789999999998
nothing else so they just couldn't talk

1838.649 --> 1842.07
about what happening the Flat Earth

1840.479 --> 1845.669
awakening the things that I'm actually

1842.07 --> 1849.6899999999998
dealing with they they can't say it's

1845.669 --> 1852.21
impossible for them and I've I fear eyes

1849.69 --> 1855.089
why that is and that is because they are

1852.21 --> 1856.979
essence of lies everything they do is

1855.089 --> 1860.58
based on lies everything they produce is

1856.979 --> 1863.429
lies and they cannot speak the truth

1860.58 --> 1868.48
because again it disrupts their essence

1863.429 --> 1874.27
it's very very fascinating to me

1868.48 --> 1876.6100000000001
so yep so the axioms overcome light

1874.27 --> 1879.46
overcome darkness with light because

1876.61 --> 1885.31
light destroys the darkness and overcome

1879.46 --> 1887.5
evil with a good old true it sounds

1885.31 --> 1890.2
almost corny but this is what I

1887.5 --> 1893.25
basically derived from my personal

1890.2 --> 1896.5900000000001
experience and experiments basically

1893.25 --> 1900.13
that I'd not even purely understood back

1896.59 --> 1902.26
then but now I'm seeing the full

1900.13 --> 1905.44
spectrum of what it was actually doing

1902.26 --> 1907.45
what I could I have felt like I don't

1905.44 --> 1910.45
understand this but I know if I do this

1907.45 --> 1913.21
I will learn a lot from it in the future

1910.45 --> 1915.49
so I have to do this and now I'm seeing

1913.21 --> 1918.9
actually what was going to end up there

1915.49 --> 1921.1
and impacting it and the same

1918.9 --> 1924.18
practically goes for a lot of my

1921.1 --> 1927.31
goldsmithing designs that I did in the

1924.18 --> 1930.76
2005-2006 period when it also made my

1927.31 --> 1933.31
ring I have no idea what I was making

1930.76 --> 1936.22
but I knew it was grand and it had such

1933.31 --> 1938.29
a heavy meaning and such depth to

1936.22 --> 1940.3600000000001
everything to The Awakening relating to

1938.29 --> 1941.95
the awakening and as I the years went

1940.36 --> 1944.1999999999998
long I just kept on looking at that

1941.95 --> 1947.1100000000001
website that I made that I haven't

1944.2 --> 1952.51
really updated that much and just seeing

1947.11 --> 1955.3
like oh my god I had no idea to how much

1952.51 --> 1959.26
this is true and how deep it reaches and

1955.3 --> 1962.8
how it connects now and that's just

1959.26 --> 1965.44
incredible it's I'm feel very blessed to

1962.8 --> 1967.71
have this kind of like through time

1965.44 --> 1970.78
inside or something

1967.71 --> 1972.7
intuitively it is for involved every

1970.78 --> 1975.33
time that I do these things it's so

1972.7 --> 1979.54
intuitive and every time now I speak

1975.33 --> 1983.5
like knowledge or make a statement it's

1979.54 --> 1986.3799999999999
very bizarre because some of these

1983.5 --> 1989.23
things I think I don't remember

1986.38 --> 1992.65
ever having looked up even oh I just

1989.23 --> 1997.39
know it is and then it turns out to be

1992.65 --> 1999.94
true and it's like yeah I remember

1997.39 --> 2003.0
researching this or looking it up but

1999.94 --> 2006.24
that memory may not be from the actual

2003.0 --> 2010.65
physical past it may just be from the

2006.24 --> 2012.84
entire time well it's so bizarre but

2010.65 --> 2015.8400000000001
that's how I feel work that's how the

2012.84 --> 2017.58
Akashic record works it's like the

2015.84 --> 2020.01
library of all knowledge and if you

2017.58 --> 2023.1
would think like okay how would that

2020.01 --> 2026.61
work well simply take all knowledge

2023.1 --> 2029.73
throughout time that's the thing you

2026.61 --> 2032.01
have access to basically through a

2029.73 --> 2034.38
certain angle of the spirit or whatever

2032.01 --> 2038.25
and that's how it's probably work so

2034.38 --> 2041.7800000000002
just go with it and see what gets handed

2038.25 --> 2041.78
down to me as I go

2043.13 --> 2050.3
but you don't you don't go seeking

2045.59 --> 2051.889
anymore no why actually I'm more busying

2050.3 --> 2054.71
myself of putting the brakes on it

2051.889 --> 2058.179
because it's well it doesn't stop I

2054.71 --> 2065.3
don't want it to stop really but it's

2058.179 --> 2067.73
often too much so sometimes I wish like

2065.3 --> 2074.389
yeah maybe there's I need a break in

2067.73 --> 2077.6
between all this heavy stuff we do tend

2074.389 --> 2080.27
to get that break and sometimes it's a

2077.6 --> 2083.149
surprise and it's we did we start

2080.27 --> 2085.06
missing the action but there is a time

2083.149 --> 2088.79
for resting there's a time for

2085.06 --> 2090.98
recuperating and restoring so that the

2088.79 --> 2094.55
net when the next wave comes the next

2090.98 --> 2096.859
onslaught we're now ready and there's a

2094.55 --> 2102.59
wisdom behind that and I'm learning to

2096.859 --> 2108.22
love him my daddy you know he's very

2102.59 --> 2111.53
wise and he doesn't overwhelm he doesn't

2108.22 --> 2114.23
if I'm trusting him I can see that I'm

2111.53 --> 2116.3590000000004
not being overwhelmed if I'm not even

2114.23 --> 2117.859
looking at him I will tend to be

2116.359 --> 2118.85
overwhelmed no matter what even if it's

2117.859 --> 2121.6
a small thing

2118.85 --> 2125.0
it'll just throw me off but when I'm

2121.6 --> 2127.58
it's it it's like walking with your hand

2125.0 --> 2131.39
in your parents hand I can't see the

2127.58 --> 2134.0299999999997
road as far as he can I'm very small and

2131.39 --> 2136.31
I I have to hold his hand I need to

2134.03 --> 2139.4300000000003
trust him because he can see the cars

2136.31 --> 2146.2599999999998
coming and he can see other hazards and

2139.43 --> 2150.6499999999996
he's saying wait or now let's go stop

2146.26 --> 2155.21
and and it's okay I mean I it's that

2150.65 --> 2159.23
simple it's it's that essential that as

2155.21 --> 2160.88
I'm watching my son grow and I'm seeing

2159.23 --> 2162.8
certain thing I'm observing human

2160.88 --> 2165.05
behavior and I'm getting to see how

2162.8 --> 2169.3
maybe I was when I was little right now

2165.05 --> 2176.15
I'm learning things because children are

2169.3 --> 2176.57
such a pure source of learning lessons

2176.15 --> 2178.7000000000003
that

2176.57 --> 2181.5800000000004
we wouldn't have perceived as children

2178.7 --> 2184.5499999999997
and as a parent you're going why don't

2181.58 --> 2186.7999999999997
you trust me it's they got to learn to

2184.55 --> 2189.17
do that but well they could they grow

2186.8 --> 2191.75
they're gradually they can't just take

2189.17 --> 2193.4
on that giant layer with all the

2191.75 --> 2198.43
complexities that came with it they have

2193.4 --> 2203.0
to go there slowly in their own patience

2198.43 --> 2206.06
now as a child my earliest memories were

2203.0 --> 2214.28
traumatic as is common with most folks

2206.06 --> 2218.2599999999998
unless they mmm I joke about it too

2214.28 --> 2220.9700000000003
laughs in the face of of the dark side I

2218.26 --> 2223.61
thought I was suicidal at age two and a

2220.97 --> 2227.1699999999996
half but I wasn't I will although I was

2223.61 --> 2231.98
dabbling with something I shouldn't have

2227.17 --> 2238.79
I learned early on disobedience can lead

2231.98 --> 2240.89
to death I was so my next brother was

2238.79 --> 2243.23
born when I was 18 months old so here

2240.89 --> 2245.33
I'm at - I already have some memories

2243.23 --> 2249.62
and then at age two and a half I

2245.33 --> 2252.71
realized the memory is that I'm watching

2249.62 --> 2254.39
my mother get my younger brother ready

2252.71 --> 2256.94
we're supposed to go somewhere it's a

2254.39 --> 2258.7999999999997
Sunday we're I'm presuming that it was

2256.94 --> 2262.1
to some kind of get-together in the

2258.8 --> 2264.86
meeting and I was already dressed

2262.1 --> 2270.62
I had my shiny black shoes on and I had

2264.86 --> 2272.81
a big polkadot dress and had my hair

2270.62 --> 2274.67
done and everything and she was just

2272.81 --> 2277.43
bathing my younger brother and getting

2274.67 --> 2280.91
getting ready to dress him up and dress

2277.43 --> 2284.33
herself then my siblings were out in the

2280.91 --> 2287.75
backyard billing glass bottles with

2284.33 --> 2289.91
water and watering the garden and I

2287.75 --> 2293.3
wanted to join in and I was asking her

2289.91 --> 2299.77
may I do that and she flatly said no you

2293.3 --> 2303.1400000000003
could get hurt oh I won't get hurt

2299.77 --> 2305.99
why would I get hurt they're having fun

2303.14 --> 2309.58
why can't I have fun and inside me I

2305.99 --> 2316.06
heard this voice going if she can't

2309.58 --> 2318.73
you it'll be okay I went along with that

2316.06 --> 2320.74
and I made sure she couldn't see me and

2318.73 --> 2322.96
I went and grabbed one of the bottles

2320.74 --> 2328.18
apparently it was like a Welch's juice

2322.96 --> 2331.36
bottle and I all content with myself

2328.18 --> 2337.45
that I had you know pulled that part off

2331.36 --> 2340.75
I went out from the elevated back porch

2337.45 --> 2345.7599999999998
area to the driveway to head to the

2340.75 --> 2347.26
garden and I tripped and I fell I was

2345.76 --> 2348.9100000000003
born left-handed

2347.26 --> 2351.94
you know it's holding the bottle in my

2348.91 --> 2354.5499999999997
left hand and I fell forward and it's

2351.94 --> 2358.63
the bottle got smashed right into my

2354.55 --> 2366.94
wrist and it cut my artery sheesh I saw

2358.63 --> 2368.2200000000003
blood shooting quite far and I was in a

2366.94 --> 2371.14
state of shock

2368.22 --> 2374.52
never in my life my short life had I

2371.14 --> 2378.37
seen anything like that I'm like wow and

2374.52 --> 2382.06
but no pain and just concerned because I

2378.37 --> 2383.71
realize I'm I'm getting there's a mess

2382.06 --> 2386.5
going on here my mom's gonna be mad

2383.71 --> 2391.45
because you know we're supposed to go

2386.5 --> 2394.24
somewhere and I'm trying to push my

2391.45 --> 2396.46
wrist up against my belly did you know

2394.24 --> 2400.7799999999997
unconsciously start to the blood flow

2396.46 --> 2403.48
and my my second sister looks over at me

2400.78 --> 2407.05
she sees a spatter of blood on me and

2403.48 --> 2410.02
she hollers out to my mother Irene has

2407.05 --> 2413.5
cut her but her belly come you know come

2410.02 --> 2415.93
and get her and mom runs that she she

2413.5 --> 2420.94
makes sure that my brother is safe she

2415.93 --> 2424.12
runs out she sees she grabs ahold of me

2420.94 --> 2426.16
she you know my my wrist of course she

2424.12 --> 2430.0899999999997
didn't work out so she clamps down on

2426.16 --> 2431.5299999999997
the wrist she hollers it the kids take

2430.09 --> 2434.44
care of your little brother I'm gonna

2431.53 --> 2441.7200000000003
take her to the hospital and tell daddy

2434.44 --> 2441.7200000000003
and so she's running towards the gate I

2442.2 --> 2449.7
vaguely here a car slam on the brakes

2446.549 --> 2453.69
and I hear a voice get in and this is in

2449.7 --> 2455.299
Portuguese get in I'll take you and she

2453.69 --> 2459.93
ducks into the cab

2455.299 --> 2465.0
turns out to be a cab and I pass out and

2459.93 --> 2469.0989999999997
I woke up in the emergency area too

2465.0 --> 2471.93
gentle tones of a voice speaking in a

2469.099 --> 2475.049
speaking English in a Brazilian accent

2471.93 --> 2477.8689999999997
and my mother crying softly saying thank

2475.049 --> 2481.2
you so much and okay and things like

2477.869 --> 2485.279
that and someone stuck a lollipop in my

2481.2 --> 2488.0099999999998
right hand and I just sat there basking

2485.279 --> 2492.119
and you know the puzzlement of it all

2488.01 --> 2496.4700000000003
like what happened so she later told me

2492.119 --> 2500.1600000000003
that it turns out that the gentleman who

2496.47 --> 2506.9399999999996
did surgery on my wrist had done triage

2500.16 --> 2510.18
in Korea and he had learned English in

2506.94 --> 2512.759
the process and so he was thrilled that

2510.18 --> 2514.44
he was there to take care of me and to

2512.759 --> 2516.869
be able to talk with her and reassure

2514.44 --> 2522.42
her there would be okay so I got 35

2516.869 --> 2528.259
stitches on my wrist I've got scars can

2522.42 --> 2534.569
you show that again yeah didn't see I

2528.259 --> 2537.509
see yeah although yes okay let me show

2534.569 --> 2540.48
you the path it's it's gathered here

2537.509 --> 2544.069
yeah right there you thought so and the

2540.48 --> 2548.4
tendons were severed for my pinky and my

2544.069 --> 2550.17
annular finger so he he sewed them he

2548.4 --> 2552.9
connected them to the middle finger so

2550.17 --> 2556.41
this is what I had a really good job yes

2552.9 --> 2562.259
and I can play guitar not as good as

2556.41 --> 2569.8599999999997
Issa but I can play my brother taught me

2562.259 --> 2574.7
how to play when I was 14 and you know

2569.86 --> 2577.13
I've never seen an angel or a demon that

2574.7 --> 2580.21
I know of but I've seen the effects

2577.13 --> 2583.52
thereof and the cabbie

2580.21 --> 2587.9900000000002
mom says that as he's driving her the

2583.52 --> 2590.03
few blocks to the hospital he said I've

2587.99 --> 2593.18
never come down this way before I had

2590.03 --> 2595.3700000000003
dropped someone off and I was looking

2593.18 --> 2597.2599999999998
for a way to get to the main road the

2595.37 --> 2598.7
Avenue and I've never come this way

2597.26 --> 2600.98
before so I didn't know where I was

2598.7 --> 2605.12
going he said but I felt something

2600.98 --> 2608.12
pushing me to come this way and then I

2605.12 --> 2612.04
saw you and I understood and she says

2608.12 --> 2614.99
what he says it must have been an angel

2612.04 --> 2618.5299999999997
not that he saw one but that he felt the

2614.99 --> 2620.54
urge yes soul impulse that's how they

2618.53 --> 2630.05
all speak it's how the angel speak it's

2620.54 --> 2632.39
how and we do get urges we do get

2630.05 --> 2635.42
suggestions I'm pretty sure I've I've

2632.39 --> 2638.6299999999997
heard many and I've even heard caution

2635.42 --> 2639.77
like if you keep doing this there's

2638.63 --> 2642.71
gonna be a problem

2639.77 --> 2643.34
I heard that well it was funny gonna be

2642.71 --> 2647.66
a problem

2643.34 --> 2648.98
and sure enough yes well you can feel it

2647.66 --> 2651.47
the funny thing is when they speak yeah

2648.98 --> 2654.35
do you feel it but that that thing that

2651.47 --> 2657.3799999999997
happened to you that's voice inside of

2654.35 --> 2660.74
you you can do this that is a perfect

2657.38 --> 2663.35
example of a Luciferian seduction it is

2660.74 --> 2667.3999999999996
arrogance it's very serious

2663.35 --> 2670.91
yeah mania like I am more than I'm

2667.4 --> 2676.07
actually in that thing mm-hmm and that

2670.91 --> 2677.54
was clearly it so yeah you learn a heavy

2676.07 --> 2680.869
lesson from it

2677.54 --> 2687.5299999999997
I sure did I still committed many more

2680.869 --> 2690.6800000000003
mistakes but I mean some some lessons

2687.53 --> 2691.4900000000002
take they bear repeating because if we

2690.68 --> 2694.25
don't get it

2691.49 --> 2697.1299999999997
the first time the one who is teaching

2694.25 --> 2699.44
us so patiently he will bring it around

2697.13 --> 2705.5
again he'll bring up another opportunity

2699.44 --> 2707.7200000000003
and it really the more me we mature the

2705.5 --> 2709.88
better equipped we are to make these

2707.72 --> 2712.79
choices to go oh yeah 20/20 hindsight

2709.88 --> 2715.79
that didn't work out so all that time

2712.79 --> 2718.94
maybe I should try obeying this time or

2715.79 --> 2723.5299999999997
you know heeding the voice and the

2718.94 --> 2725.6
warning and the to be encouraged to

2723.53 --> 2728.6600000000003
listen to the actual encouragement of if

2725.6 --> 2730.2799999999997
you go this way there will be blessing

2728.66 --> 2734.75
if you go that way there's gonna be

2730.28 --> 2737.1800000000003
cursing so choose life or death and the

2734.75 --> 2741.92
fun part that's coming out of watching

2737.18 --> 2745.16
Owen Benjamin is when he starts talking

2741.92 --> 2748.4
about the dark side and the you know the

2745.16 --> 2752.5699999999997
light and he starts going who is your

2748.4 --> 2755.06
master and I'm going there you go there

2752.57 --> 2760.67
you go yes who is master who will you

2755.06 --> 2762.44
serve I entered the lights yes it is

2760.67 --> 2767.1800000000003
where my strength I do where my spirit

2762.44 --> 2769.13
is it is where my passion is yes and all

2767.18 --> 2772.49
the other things I've learned to reject

2769.13 --> 2775.9900000000002
and to strip off the brightest part of

2772.49 --> 2779.54
the flame I don't need that Luciferian

2775.99 --> 2782.8689999999997
overkill right and oh I have been

2779.54 --> 2787.42
seduced by that very heavily it's very

2782.869 --> 2790.19
easy yeah yeah but it'll burn you up

2787.42 --> 2799.06
weren't too bright you'll burn yourself

2790.19 --> 2803.2400000000002
up I had tons of opportunities to learn

2799.06 --> 2806.21
things that you might have learned in in

2803.24 --> 2809.2099999999996
the heavy way that you described mine

2806.21 --> 2811.309
were they were emotionally packed

2809.21 --> 2815.809
they were very d

2811.309 --> 2817.009
but I always sensed that I was being

2815.809 --> 2819.2290000000003
guided yeah

2817.009 --> 2822.89
and that I was being shown a lot of

2819.229 --> 2825.589
things so that I could understand and I

2822.89 --> 2830.479
got to the point where even out loud

2825.589 --> 2835.159
I was speaking into my space

2830.479 --> 2837.3799999999997
I will not control others I refuse to

2835.159 --> 2840.909
try to manipulate them or influence them

2837.38 --> 2843.829
in any way to do what needs to be done

2840.909 --> 2846.949
if I need to appeal to Authority I will

2843.829 --> 2850.279
do so but will not do it in a whiny

2846.949 --> 2853.219
voice and I will not do it just to

2850.279 --> 2857.029
benefit myself I need to refine how I

2853.219 --> 2860.109
pray and I got lots of lessons on how to

2857.029 --> 2865.699
you know how what prayer really is and

2860.109 --> 2871.519
how to use it and for what reasons what

2865.699 --> 2873.589
goals and it started to make a big

2871.519 --> 2875.419
difference in my attitude and and so

2873.589 --> 2879.709
things the other people were doing

2875.419 --> 2881.2889999999998
weren't troubling me as much I could see

2879.709 --> 2885.109
that they were going to reap

2881.289 --> 2887.809
consequences I could if it was my

2885.109 --> 2890.449
children I could gently nudge them and

2887.809 --> 2893.63
say you know maybe you need to look at

2890.449 --> 2900.2290000000003
that maybe you need to take some time

2893.63 --> 2902.179
and hash it out understand why you're

2900.229 --> 2904.64
wanting this or why you're wanting that

2902.179 --> 2907.789
or why you're rejecting this or the

2904.64 --> 2909.949
other and find out what you really want

2907.789 --> 2912.4390000000003
and to see if it's good and then go

2909.949 --> 2915.039
after it and if it's something really

2912.439 --> 2918.8289999999997
bad then you need to get rid of it and

2915.039 --> 2922.009
so I have spoken of my daughter she has

2918.829 --> 2924.619
been through many testings some I was

2922.009 --> 2928.489
aware of some I was not when they

2924.619 --> 2933.409
finally came out I was amazed at how

2928.489 --> 2939.14
wise she was and how much she had

2933.409 --> 2941.029
learned and how wholesome she had you

2939.14 --> 2945.019
know in in the wholesome way that she

2941.029 --> 2950.149
ended up responding to her situations

2945.019 --> 2952.669
she faced and I have confidence that she

2950.149 --> 2955.969
will continue doing that she's very

2952.669 --> 2961.459
sweet and sensitive and yet she's also a

2955.969 --> 2967.489
warrior and when she was to be born the

2961.459 --> 2969.6789999999996
vision was her hands and I had the

2967.489 --> 2975.399
impression that she was going to be

2969.679 --> 2975.399
victorious in prayer warrior ring and

2977.439 --> 2982.729
she's come a long way and she's got a

2980.449 --> 2985.2490000000003
calling on her life and even though

2982.729 --> 2988.7889999999998
she's resisting right now she's also not

2985.249 --> 2992.209
resisting she's she's resisting in the

2988.789 --> 2994.699
sense that she won't church on eyes it

2992.209 --> 2996.6789999999996
and I'm proud of her that I told her we

2994.699 --> 2999.4990000000003
needed to get rid of all this you are

2996.679 --> 3008.489
searching POC we don't do churchy talk

2999.499 --> 3011.049
anymore yeah I had to stop going to the

3008.489 --> 3013.899
congregation where I was attending it I

3011.049 --> 3015.489
had naturally attached to them because

3013.899 --> 3022.439
my parents were going there and it was

3015.489 --> 3026.319
from a group that our family members and

3022.439 --> 3031.239
anyway we we just find the nearest one

3026.319 --> 3036.719
and go there they were starting to teach

3031.239 --> 3036.719
a lot of the the New Age stuff and the

3036.839 --> 3042.179
things that were hum from which angle

3042.839 --> 3051.069
the way the pastor could it was I'm

3046.809 --> 3053.469
wanting to take back everything that the

3051.069 --> 3056.409
devil has taken away from us so he was

3053.469 --> 3059.109
talking I want to reincorporate yoga I

3056.409 --> 3062.049
want centric prayer I want centric

3059.109 --> 3065.139
worship and I want everyone to learn

3062.049 --> 3067.839
that everyone plays no one is left out

3065.139 --> 3072.579
everyone has the potential to go out

3067.839 --> 3075.159
walking like Peter or Paul and and cause

3072.579 --> 3077.739
healing to happen and also lay on hands

3075.159 --> 3078.04
and do all that and some of it sounded

3077.739 --> 3080.28
good

3078.04 --> 3086.11
but the other part was going I was going

3080.28 --> 3093.01
why are you trying to recover something

3086.11 --> 3094.33
that wasn't ours in the first place the

3093.01 --> 3097.2400000000002
voice just started to go and pay

3094.33 --> 3100.29
attention so I was paying attention and

3097.24 --> 3103.33
at one point the pastor in his

3100.29 --> 3105.79
encouragement to worship he suddenly

3103.33 --> 3108.7
spoke up and whatever is being

3105.79 --> 3112.14
antagonistic here you need to stop it

3108.7 --> 3115.3599999999997
and I just went is it me

3112.14 --> 3119.2599999999998
am I being antagonistic because I'm

3115.36 --> 3121.1200000000003
resisting what you're teaching and he

3119.26 --> 3123.3700000000003
never said it directly to me and I never

3121.12 --> 3126.85
spoke another word about it to him

3123.37 --> 3131.14
although I had spoken with him about my

3126.85 --> 3134.14
position like months before but suddenly

3131.14 --> 3137.17
now there was this this tone in him like

3134.14 --> 3139.75
what's this antagonism boy and I hadn't

3137.17 --> 3143.05
been antagonistic to the best of my

3139.75 --> 3149.47
knowledge but when I looked up and said

3143.05 --> 3154.15
is it me all I got was time to go and I

3149.47 --> 3158.0499999999997
left I I finished up my Sunday School

3154.15 --> 3164.08
class that day and I I was teaching the

3158.05 --> 3165.94
children ages 6 to 10 and I was fully

3164.08 --> 3168.58
aware that I might not see them again

3165.94 --> 3173.4700000000003
not in that situation not in that venue

3168.58 --> 3179.7999999999997
and I encouraged them to research things

3173.47 --> 3183.1
for themselves to learn things to not be

3179.8 --> 3185.17
satisfied with just what people tell you

3183.1 --> 3189.16
go looking for yourself because God

3185.17 --> 3195.73
wants to teach you God wants to show you

3189.16 --> 3201.99
things and I said I said goodbyes and I

3195.73 --> 3204.94
went home and I never went back and the

3201.99 --> 3208.18
connection I found after that I had

3204.94 --> 3211.9
already been joining up in the online

3208.18 --> 3215.2
virtual house church that was

3211.9 --> 3218.83
created under Rob's Cubist's guidance or

3215.2 --> 3223.2999999999997
necessity literally to have some people

3218.83 --> 3227.41
to contact to talk with to share and to

3223.3 --> 3231.55
interact with on a weekly basis so that

3227.41 --> 3235.96
that was that became my central point

3231.55 --> 3239.32
besides my middle brother who has been

3235.96 --> 3241.54
my companion in this endeavor in this

3239.32 --> 3245.0800000000004
journey we both came to flatter at the

3241.54 --> 3248.71
same time we were both turning to God at

3245.08 --> 3251.3199999999997
the same time him more dramatically than

3248.71 --> 3253.57
I because I had technically always been

3251.32 --> 3257.77
in the church but he had he was like

3253.57 --> 3260.98
literally I don't want this but he was

3257.77 --> 3263.41
very active in that group of churches

3260.98 --> 3265.3
that we had he was like I'm the one that

3263.41 --> 3269.14
got you guys to go there and he says now

3265.3 --> 3271.03
I'm repenting because we're what we were

3269.14 --> 3274.65
watching it be transformed into

3271.03 --> 3277.0600000000004
something that's completely opposite and

3274.65 --> 3279.37
this has been going on in a lot of

3277.06 --> 3282.25
churches and in a lot of the different

3279.37 --> 3286.5099999999998
sectors I don't want to call them sect

3282.25 --> 3291.48
but sectors of what what is considered

3286.51 --> 3294.67
to be Christianity to me has become I

3291.48 --> 3297.61
got to the point where I can say if

3294.67 --> 3301.06
Christianity was created by the Vatican

3297.61 --> 3303.28
by the Roman Empire then I'm not a

3301.06 --> 3308.13
Christian I refuse to be a Christian I

3303.28 --> 3309.9100000000003
am simply a follower of the way yes and

3308.13 --> 3312.28
that's all

3309.91 --> 3315.43
and I I will settle for nothing less

3312.28 --> 3320.5600000000004
than the truth I want to be set free

3315.43 --> 3322.75
from all lives I want to be feeding good

3320.56 --> 3324.82
food to people I don't want to be giving

3322.75 --> 3329.65
them junk so please get the junk out of

3324.82 --> 3333.8500000000004
me and give I want the good food I want

3329.65 --> 3335.88
the banquet and that's what I seek and i

3333.85 --> 3335.88
find

3336.81 --> 3345.15
Wow amazing

3341.1 --> 3347.67
I feel such sounds kind of weird I feel

3345.15 --> 3351.84
such a connection with you and feel that

3347.67 --> 3355.32
we're very synchronized in certain

3351.84 --> 3358.4700000000003
energies and approaches I I just

3355.32 --> 3361.7400000000002
it's so weird experience but talking to

3358.47 --> 3365.0099999999998
you I just immediately feel with with

3361.74 --> 3370.5299999999997
whatever I say that you're getting it

3365.01 --> 3374.9900000000002
like on a higher level and I hope that's

3370.53 --> 3379.9500000000003
reciprocated I probably is but yeah it's

3374.99 --> 3384.06
sometimes I get a bit not overwhelmed

3379.95 --> 3386.5499999999997
but just like impressed and it's I'm so

3384.06 --> 3390.29
glad that it's not just me you know

3386.55 --> 3392.7000000000003
because that is how I feel sometimes

3390.29 --> 3395.1
especially I guess with lots of trolls

3392.7 --> 3398.43
and everything and people with their own

3395.1 --> 3401.25
issues like I see Luciferian and

3398.43 --> 3404.85
aromanian seductions everywhere in

3401.25 --> 3407.52
everything Oh Eddie is filled with

3404.85 --> 3411.99
Lucifer and the Internet is filled with

3407.52 --> 3414.33
arimin and daily habits are just a

3411.99 --> 3419.4599999999996
combination of both extremities and

3414.33 --> 3421.98
people let the extremities increase in

3419.46 --> 3424.17
themselves it's become normalized to do

3421.98 --> 3426.0
that people don't respond to others

3424.17 --> 3428.4300000000003
acting insane anymore

3426.0 --> 3430.59
there's no more outrage almost it seems

3428.43 --> 3432.45
and that is very very worrisome to me

3430.59 --> 3435.11
and sometimes you think like oh my god I

3432.45 --> 3438.72
am just the only sane person left here

3435.11 --> 3443.04
that can still see what is normal and

3438.72 --> 3447.5699999999997
I'm glad to meet some other people that

3443.04 --> 3449.58
are on par and of course look in the

3447.57 --> 3451.9500000000003
flat earth movement and all the people

3449.58 --> 3457.35
that I deal with here yeah you guys are

3451.95 --> 3459.21
also very far but you all have your own

3457.35 --> 3461.52
directions that you take your own

3459.21 --> 3464.12
choices that cuts you off in certain

3461.52 --> 3467.81
ways and the miscommunicate

3464.12 --> 3470.38
is very apparent yeah it's very apparent

3467.81 --> 3472.94
also on the personal conversations and

3470.38 --> 3475.13
sometimes I say something very directly

3472.94 --> 3477.71
and it's taken offensively and then

3475.13 --> 3480.29
there's like a like a new war response

3477.71 --> 3483.23
to it with people that are supposedly

3480.29 --> 3487.49
friends and I don't get it because I

3483.23 --> 3493.34
want people to be that harsh real with

3487.49 --> 3495.62
me and or maybe not not with the nine

3493.34 --> 3498.71
that's not nice but to be together with

3495.62 --> 3501.08
me and yeah I will take it I will take

3498.71 --> 3502.94
whatever you give me because I want to

3501.08 --> 3504.44
learn I want to improve but there's also

3502.94 --> 3508.16
a lot of things that I know about myself

3504.44 --> 3510.58
and I have to manage like you can't rush

3508.16 --> 3514.52
me it's one thing that I've learned

3510.58 --> 3518.81
brutally because I am I want everything

3514.52 --> 3523.07
instantly but as a result I get nothing

3518.81 --> 3525.2
done and it's very hard to finish things

3523.07 --> 3527.9
that are long-term processes and that's

3525.2 --> 3530.75
been my biggest struggle and it's all

3527.9 --> 3532.67
because of impatience basically so every

3530.75 --> 3534.71
time somebody else gets impatient with

3532.67 --> 3536.51
me but I'm not quick enough

3534.71 --> 3539.78
that's like terror because you're

3536.51 --> 3542.8700000000003
actually seducing me Luciferian wise to

3539.78 --> 3545.63
go beyond my borders and just force

3542.87 --> 3547.73
myself on the world with whatever that's

3545.63 --> 3550.4
going to be and that's never gonna work

3547.73 --> 3553.76
out I will break down if that happens I

3550.4 --> 3559.03
know it I've experienced it

3553.76 --> 3562.88
and yeah then there's just yeah people

3559.03 --> 3567.2000000000003
sometimes I don't know not everybody

3562.88 --> 3569.9300000000003
flares up this heavy I guess mentally or

3567.2 --> 3572.4199999999996
as this need to really look that deep

3569.93 --> 3574.85
many people like to keep it a little bit

3572.42 --> 3578.15
more simple or a lot more simple

3574.85 --> 3582.8199999999997
depending on just what type of personal

3578.15 --> 3582.82
culture they they carry the wheeled

3582.88 --> 3590.48
about it the I appreciate so having

3585.619 --> 3598.1600000000003
somebody like you on them I'm glad to

3590.48 --> 3606.47
help any kid I'm a good listener I blame

3598.16 --> 3611.02
my parents my dad was a missionary kid

3606.47 --> 3615.109
born in Africa in Angola my mother's a

3611.02 --> 3617.03
missionary kid born in Bolivia and I had

3615.109 --> 3620.0299999999997
the privilege and blessing of being born

3617.03 --> 3623.57
in Brazil and I have a sister that was

3620.03 --> 3626.15
born in Jamaica and I have two brothers

3623.57 --> 3629.869
that were also born in Brazil one in

3626.15 --> 3631.7000000000003
central Brazil among the natives and the

3629.869 --> 3633.5
other one at the same hospital that I

3631.7 --> 3635.54
was important in in South Brazil and

3633.5 --> 3638.99
then my oldest sister's the only one

3635.54 --> 3641.66
well no my oldest sister and my middle

3638.99 --> 3644.72
brother were born in the States so we're

3641.66 --> 3646.8799999999997
from all over and the joke is you know

3644.72 --> 3648.5899999999997
cultural stuff going on and all that my

3646.88 --> 3650.7200000000003
dad joked with my mother when she was

3648.59 --> 3653.69
pregnant with me how about we go over to

3650.72 --> 3667.9399999999996
Argentina and have the babes there over

3653.69 --> 3672.05
my dead body hilarious so we are the UN

3667.94 --> 3675.14
we are the world oh sorry

3672.05 --> 3677.6000000000004
I've never left the three Americas these

3675.14 --> 3679.8199999999997
are the only places I've been i've you

3677.6 --> 3681.41
know caribbean and all that but I've

3679.82 --> 3685.1000000000004
never been to here I've never been

3681.41 --> 3687.2
outside of the Americas although I have

3685.1 --> 3687.589
connections to people all around the

3687.2 --> 3690.259
world

3687.589 --> 3693.739
it's just been through the internet and

3690.259 --> 3695.329
that's to me has been a blessing but I'm

3693.739 --> 3699.979
you know I'm always curious about

3695.329 --> 3703.13
cultural things and about how the social

3699.979 --> 3705.4689999999996
stratas work and the manipulations of

3703.13 --> 3708.609
the government and you know how they

3705.469 --> 3714.109
heard people in a particular direction

3708.609 --> 3718.7889999999998
putting up Corral's and bringing on you

3714.109 --> 3722.509
know yeah total terror scenarios and and

3718.789 --> 3726.259
you know that's why 9/11 became such a a

3722.509 --> 3731.18
goalpost for me I realized you know I

3726.259 --> 3736.209
was having this conversation with my

3731.18 --> 3741.9199999999996
daddy my spiritual connection there and

3736.209 --> 3747.439
I heard him say wrong enemy wrong

3741.92 --> 3753.109
weapons and I'm like oh wow and from

3747.439 --> 3760.3689999999997
then on it was veil off and it's been

3753.109 --> 3764.42
quite a journey roller coaster ride but

3760.369 --> 3766.969
when just the other day I've been I've

3764.42 --> 3769.339
been noticing people talking about the

3766.969 --> 3770.959
mud floods and so there's two camps

3769.339 --> 3773.8289999999997
there's the there's no way

3770.959 --> 3778.189
then there's the oh wow right they go

3773.829 --> 3781.309
because some people have learned to go

3778.189 --> 3783.049
ahead and look at everything because you

3781.309 --> 3785.329
never know what nuggets you might find

3783.049 --> 3787.67
in there exactly and the others are

3785.329 --> 3789.739
triggered and they don't want to look

3787.67 --> 3792.049
they think it's all nonsense it's an

3789.739 --> 3794.239
information gold rush of the internet

3792.049 --> 3798.41
you never know what you might find

3794.239 --> 3801.049
exactly and it means something you know

3798.41 --> 3803.239
particular to each individual looking at

3801.049 --> 3805.309
it so the ones who are drawn to it are

3803.239 --> 3809.7490000000003
getting something from it the ones who

3805.309 --> 3812.049
are resisting it last night I just typed

3809.749 --> 3814.9689999999996
it out if you're feeling triggered

3812.049 --> 3816.979
question the trigger because we have

3814.969 --> 3820.31
that we all have indoctrination to deal

3816.979 --> 3822.1899999999996
with we're we're encountering it daily

3820.31 --> 3824.15
and we're some what some of us are

3822.19 --> 3825.98
realizing that and others are just

3824.15 --> 3828.2000000000003
ignoring it and just going that's just

3825.98 --> 3829.88
nonsense didn't we say the same thing

3828.2 --> 3832.16
about flatter didn't we say the same

3829.88 --> 3834.65
thing about 9/11 didn't we say the same

3832.16 --> 3837.5899999999997
thing about JFK didn't we say the same

3834.65 --> 3840.65
thing about every false flag that has

3837.59 --> 3846.1400000000003
happened that's just impossible it's

3840.65 --> 3848.78
silly it can't be well it might be so

3846.14 --> 3852.74
look into it that's that's the best

3848.78 --> 3854.21
advice anybody can give us go look you

3852.74 --> 3858.95
know at the very least you might

3854.21 --> 3861.7400000000002
discount it you can't vote another thing

3858.95 --> 3864.8599999999997
to add to that don't just look don't

3861.74 --> 3868.0099999999998
just type it in and see right look one

3864.86 --> 3871.13
video no you have to understand that

3868.01 --> 3873.6200000000003
there is absolutely controlled

3871.13 --> 3876.71
opposition and that if you are still

3873.62 --> 3878.93
asleep that the system surrounding you

3876.71 --> 3884.7200000000003
that are active all these spy mechanisms

3878.93 --> 3887.4199999999996
all these AI Google algorithms are all

3884.72 --> 3890.2099999999996
focusing on keeping you there so that's

3887.42 --> 3892.01
really real that's not that's not a

3890.21 --> 3894.08
conspiracy theory they do that it's

3892.01 --> 3896.6000000000004
narrative control you're gonna look for

3894.08 --> 3899.6
something outside of that box it's first

3896.6 --> 3901.49
gonna give you all the [ __ ] of that and

3899.6 --> 3904.64
you're gonna have to really and really

3901.49 --> 3906.35
really really really look that go

3904.64 --> 3910.0699999999997
through it all until you find something

3906.35 --> 3912.44
that makes half way sense or when

3910.07 --> 3914.57
somebody actually starts talking about

3912.44 --> 3917.75
Flat Earth in a good way or in a

3914.57 --> 3922.3700000000003
spiritual way that's really sharp and

3917.75 --> 3923.87
not weird or deluded or kooky extremely

3922.37 --> 3926.0499999999997
and they're people out there there's

3923.87 --> 3928.58
nothing that neck yeah not necessarily

3926.05 --> 3930.44
negative but they just have another

3928.58 --> 3933.74
approach but if you want to learn you

3930.44 --> 3935.4
have to really dig with any subject if

3933.74 --> 3938.64
you are still completely

3935.4 --> 3940.589
enveloped in in-state ism belief

3938.64 --> 3942.39
basically with all the narratives and

3940.589 --> 3943.8289999999997
all the standard narratives that come

3942.39 --> 3945.569
with that if you're still in there

3943.829 --> 3947.849
you're gonna have to really dig because

3945.569 --> 3949.92
you're first always gonna be confronted

3947.849 --> 3952.38
with the most ridiculous [ __ ] about it

3949.92 --> 3955.7400000000002
to discourage you from looking further

3952.38 --> 3958.1400000000003
that's real it happens I've seen it I've

3955.74 --> 3962.43
asked other people hey why don't you

3958.14 --> 3967.65
google this he's like okay and then he

3962.43 --> 3973.019
does it he shows it now look at my

3967.65 --> 3975.1800000000003
results how it's entirely it's like huh

3973.019 --> 3978.839
that's completely different yeah what do

3975.18 --> 3980.759
you think that is and that's also an

3978.839 --> 3984.69
away you can show that that is actually

3980.759 --> 3988.619
real research result is fine tailored to

3984.69 --> 3990.779
your paradigm so the computers the

3988.619 --> 3994.2000000000003
algorithms understanding of your

3990.779 --> 3996.42
paradigm even though you might not know

3994.2 --> 3999.6299999999997
it it knows it because it knows all the

3996.42 --> 4002.299
paradigms it takes notice of all your

3999.63 --> 4006.17
activity and that you know and even even

4002.299 --> 4008.839
with that it still throws in the odd the

4006.17 --> 4011.96
odd man out the Joker card because still

4008.839 --> 4014.72
in my streams I mean in my listings will

4011.96 --> 4018.17
show up something from NASA something

4014.72 --> 4021.4399999999996
from SpaceX something from you know

4018.17 --> 4025.16
Trump or you know be part of the

4021.44 --> 4028.099
revolution or whatever you know things

4025.16 --> 4030.5589999999997
that are distractions things that are

4028.099 --> 4034.4
they're real to a certain extent but

4030.559 --> 4037.4300000000003
they're not what they appear to be so it

4034.4 --> 4039.44
still it still does that I have to have

4037.43 --> 4041.45
the opportunity to just ignore it I

4039.44 --> 4044.119
don't click on it because I don't want

4041.45 --> 4048.5589999999997
to encourage it right I don't click on

4044.119 --> 4052.19
it I just ignore it I sometimes still do

4048.559 --> 4056.2690000000002
it but the funny thing is this might be

4052.19 --> 4059.15
paranoid I really accept that I am being

4056.269 --> 4061.249
lifetime watched because I'm probably

4059.15 --> 4063.2000000000003
gonna be a person of interest in the

4061.249 --> 4064.3399999999997
wide scale of everybody's that's here

4063.2 --> 4067.79
because of the level

4064.34 --> 4071.9900000000002
it and the spiritual straightness that I

4067.79 --> 4075.95
try to exert in the open honestly so I

4071.99 --> 4078.1699999999996
do kind of life review off-air [ __ ] so

4075.95 --> 4080.96
if I see a video and it has good content

4078.17 --> 4083.33
I will actually watch it and it does

4080.96 --> 4085.19
give me that a little bit more than just

4083.33 --> 4089.7799999999997
the junk but if it's junk I will be

4085.19 --> 4093.62
swearing at my screen this [ __ ] how dare

4089.78 --> 4095.6600000000003
you show that crap in my face I didn't

4093.62 --> 4098.95
say like I'm gonna sue you Google I'm

4095.66 --> 4102.8
gonna sue you for shoving that [ __ ]

4098.95 --> 4106.28
literally I say it and I hope it listens

4102.8 --> 4109.1
and responds who knows it seems that on

4106.28 --> 4112.3099999999995
average I do get better suggestions for

4109.1 --> 4121.339
videos after having done this for a

4112.31 --> 4125.3
period but it's crazy and it's out there

4121.339 --> 4128.8
the narrative control it is paradigm

4125.3 --> 4131.569
control compartir knowledge

4128.8 --> 4134.12
compartmentalization even within the the

4131.569 --> 4137.089000000001
internet of everything where there are

4134.12 --> 4140.45
billions of videos of every conceivable

4137.089 --> 4145.4
subject of every conceivable level out

4140.45 --> 4149.2699999999995
there yet you will always be directed in

4145.4 --> 4150.65
a certain pool you always on random

4149.27 --> 4152.780000000001
search even if you don't think about it

4150.65 --> 4155.87
consciously always be suggested the same

4152.78 --> 4157.73
group of things and we've even took note

4155.87 --> 4159.5599999999995
of this with the general Flat Earth

4157.73 --> 4161.419999999999
community with Patricia steer mark

4159.56 --> 4165.38
sergeant Nathan Oakley and all of them

4161.42 --> 4167.24
they noticed this even 2-3 years ago

4165.38 --> 4169.400000000001
already talked about it right because it

4167.24 --> 4172.76
was happening then already when father

4169.4 --> 4174.53
was still very very small grassroots

4172.76 --> 4176.87
basically and it was already very

4174.53 --> 4178.58
noticeable that they were hard under

4176.87 --> 4182.41
this encouragement but it's still

4178.58 --> 4185.889
happening now and not as much not as

4182.41 --> 4188.989
rough because it's kind of

4185.889 --> 4190.9400000000005
they're just trying to slow it down now

4188.989 --> 4193.5199999999995
they're not trying to really prevent it

4190.94 --> 4196.909
I feel because it just can't just

4193.52 --> 4199.88
doesn't work and it snows the overseer

4196.909 --> 4202.429
AI algorithm knows whether it be a

4199.88 --> 4205.25
conscious being or not it will have

4202.429 --> 4208.7300000000005
oversight so it will know and it will

4205.25 --> 4211.13
adapt naturally so I'm looking at this

4208.73 --> 4214.098999999999
adaptation and then drawing my deduced

4211.13 --> 4216.889
conclusions that is how I do a lot of my

4214.099 --> 4218.78
insight gathering recipe and I'm just

4216.889 --> 4220.969
seeing this it's like yes still trying

4218.78 --> 4223.94
to keep people in their pool it's mostly

4220.969 --> 4226.76
about keeping the people that are still

4223.94 --> 4229.699
dug in to the standard narrative there

4226.76 --> 4232.52
that's there that what they put the most

4229.699 --> 4235.098999999999
detail and to keep that straight but the

4232.52 --> 4237.369000000001
people that are already launching in the

4235.099 --> 4239.96
wider knowledge in the counter knowledge

4237.369 --> 4243.29
they're just trying to slow it down a

4239.96 --> 4245.05
bit because yeah they know it knows it's

4243.29 --> 4250.09
no use

4245.05 --> 4253.79
that reminds me to of whenever there's a

4250.09 --> 4255.77
splintering and I don't want to make

4253.79 --> 4262.929
direct reference but when there's a

4255.77 --> 4268.76
wedge put between two friends or a group

4262.929 --> 4272.2390000000005
gets splintered shattered either from

4268.76 --> 4276.59
within or from pressures from outside

4272.239 --> 4281.449
which referring back to the scriptures

4276.59 --> 4283.969
when the young church the the new you

4281.449 --> 4287.928999999999
know the Christ followers were being

4283.969 --> 4291.17
persecuted by the Roman Empire it caused

4287.929 --> 4293.03
many to leave instead of staying in a

4291.17 --> 4296.6900000000005
group because they were basically

4293.03 --> 4303.71
becoming a commune right a community and

4296.69 --> 4307.82
they were Pro unity and pro serving God

4303.71 --> 4310.4890000000005
and walking in the way and they weren't

4307.82 --> 4313.159
about to leave they were having a good

4310.489 --> 4315.169999999999
time it was wonderful right they you

4313.159 --> 4319.07
know this is great let's let's keep it

4315.17 --> 4323.0
up so at some point

4319.07 --> 4326.33
father allows the Roman Empire to attack

4323.0 --> 4328.55
them and start putting such pressure in

4326.33 --> 4331.13
some are getting taken to the arenas and

4328.55 --> 4334.1900000000005
killed others are being thrown into

4331.13 --> 4336.32
dungeons or whatever and and there's

4334.19 --> 4340.4
financial burden there's all of a sudden

4336.32 --> 4342.799999999999
there's this necessity to get out okay

4340.4 --> 4346.219999999999
so the pressure is bringing is be is

4342.8 --> 4350.72
being brought on and you can just stop

4346.22 --> 4353.030000000001
and go why why why or you can go time to

4350.72 --> 4356.900000000001
go okay I get the message and you get

4353.03 --> 4361.7
going so at that point it is recorded

4356.9 --> 4364.639999999999
that that's where the message got taken

4361.7 --> 4367.13
to other places because they scattered

4364.64 --> 4372.83
out into the world into the known world

4367.13 --> 4376.52
and so now there were actual living

4372.83 --> 4378.5
examples of walking in the way people

4376.52 --> 4381.080000000001
could see it happening it wasn't just

4378.5 --> 4384.59
some news that they heard from over

4381.08 --> 4387.5599999999995
there from you know from Jerusalem now

4384.59 --> 4391.58
it was being brought out to the world

4387.56 --> 4394.580000000001
so in flat earth in the truth or

4391.58 --> 4396.95
community when such attacks happen I'm

4394.58 --> 4400.01
learning to walk just sit back and watch

4396.95 --> 4403.13
and and yes I'll pray for the

4400.01 --> 4405.5
individuals I don't like when lies are

4403.13 --> 4408.53
flowing around so I'll pray against

4405.5 --> 4411.91
those and I'll pray for the truth to

4408.53 --> 4418.48
come out and for it to be freeing and

4411.91 --> 4422.09
reuniting but for also the work of the

4418.48 --> 4427.28
splintering to have its place have its

4422.09 --> 4431.6900000000005
effect that if this is brought on again

4427.28 --> 4435.11
I'm asking him if this is from you then

4431.69 --> 4437.44
I receive it if it's not from you I

4435.11 --> 4440.8099999999995
don't want anything to do with it right

4437.44 --> 4444.08
so I'm I'm aligning myself with him and

4440.81 --> 4446.93
I'm rejecting the evil part of it but

4444.08 --> 4449.69
the good comes out no matter what it's

4446.93 --> 4453.019
one of the other axioms all things work

4449.69 --> 4455.768999999999
together for good right for those who

4453.019 --> 4460.309
we're called according to his name and

4455.769 --> 4464.96
so I'm positioning myself to look out

4460.309 --> 4466.76
and see the good and what can result of

4464.96 --> 4470.84
even the bad so when there's a

4466.76 --> 4472.610000000001
splintering and a scattering I know that

4470.84 --> 4474.889
that means the message will be spread

4472.61 --> 4478.039
out further and if we had stuck together

4474.889 --> 4480.829
the hole we got to stay together we got

4478.039 --> 4483.32
to be unified yes but you can go be

4480.829 --> 4484.119
unified to the source anywhere in the

4483.32 --> 4487.73
world

4484.119 --> 4490.759999999999
that's what spread the message then he's

4487.73 --> 4493.61
the one coordinating all this right he's

4490.76 --> 4497.349
using all of it to get his message out

4493.61 --> 4501.848999999999
and he wants living walking open books

4497.349 --> 4514.539
to show the world he's here he's real I

4501.849 --> 4514.539
like that yes it's the scattering effect

4516.699 --> 4522.589999999999
the light shines out that way doesn't it

4520.249 --> 4526.46
it isn't it kind of the same thing as

4522.59 --> 4528.26
the the garden of Eve yes like if they

4526.46 --> 4533.09
would stuck there there would have been

4528.26 --> 4536.9800000000005
nothing whole different history exactly

4533.09 --> 4536.9800000000005
and that man you've just

4538.84 --> 4545.110000000001
you got me and again for a lot of people

4543.25 --> 4547.0
go well if God knows everything then

4545.11 --> 4548.86
what's the point of this you know what's

4547.0 --> 4550.6
the point of it all if he knows it all

4548.86 --> 4551.259999999999
and I'm going no you're missing the

4550.6 --> 4554.110000000001
point

4551.26 --> 4556.27
the point isn't that he's decided what

4554.11 --> 4559.12
it's going to be every day every moment

4556.27 --> 4559.780000000001
the point is that he knows what it's

4559.12 --> 4562.84
gonna be

4559.78 --> 4564.37
he's not telling you you've got to feel

4562.84 --> 4566.68
like this you're gonna have to react

4564.37 --> 4571.29
like that he's not we're not robots he

4566.68 --> 4575.35
didn't create robots well he actually

4571.29 --> 4582.07
he's taking the consciousness of his the

4575.35 --> 4585.96
total oversight of God away from us to

4582.07 --> 4585.96
experience it from another perspective

4593.25 --> 4607.57
yeah that's awesome well we've been

4595.84 --> 4614.9800000000005
going almost off to continue on but I'll

4607.57 --> 4616.509999999999
put you on presentation yeah kind of

4614.98 --> 4620.679999999999
mean of me to say but please continue

4616.51 --> 4626.97
talking yeah it just it was a great

4620.68 --> 4632.71
subject so if you have more to say as

4626.97 --> 4637.030000000001
always I encourage people to seek the

4632.71 --> 4640.51
truth get rid of the lies ferret them

4637.03 --> 4643.9
out wash yourself clean of them because

4640.51 --> 4645.9400000000005
if you are clean on the inside then the

4643.9 --> 4649.929999999999
dirt won't stick when someone throws

4645.94 --> 4652.96
into that right if you if you give no

4649.93 --> 4656.1
quarter to the enemy on the inside of

4652.96 --> 4661.21
you in your mind and in your daily walk

4656.1 --> 4667.51
then they can't trick you and easily and

4661.21 --> 4672.25
they can't rope you in and you always

4667.51 --> 4676.74
have the assurance of guy

4672.25 --> 4680.08
of wonderful leadership and of

4676.74 --> 4683.5599999999995
resolution and a victory victory is

4680.08 --> 4686.71
promised if you'll just do that if

4683.56 --> 4694.51
you'll just listen and obey and trust in

4686.71 --> 4699.79
the good one the benefits are amazing

4694.51 --> 4703.18
the positivity the the self not self

4699.79 --> 4706.62
assurance but assurance is tremendous

4703.18 --> 4709.93
and no matter what you suffer in life

4706.62 --> 4713.98
you will ultimately find good coming

4709.93 --> 4716.9800000000005
from it there will be effects in your

4713.98 --> 4723.219999999999
life that either help you temper your

4716.98 --> 4729.129999999999
words or show you the best boundaries to

4723.22 --> 4733.51
respect and win to let loose so by all

4729.13 --> 4737.35
means my dear friends I love you I want

4733.51 --> 4740.38
the best for you and I want you to find

4737.35 --> 4751.030000000001
it because there's nothing like it in

4740.38 --> 4755.26
the whole wide world sir anything anyone

4751.03 --> 4764.139999999999
in particular you were addressing know

4755.26 --> 4768.97
it was for everybody yeah yeah I agree

4764.14 --> 4770.9800000000005
it's I try to bring in the habit of

4768.97 --> 4772.6900000000005
doing that kind of thing but then I just

4770.98 --> 4774.94
kind of retract it again I don't know

4772.69 --> 4775.75
why but yeah blessings on everyone is a

4774.94 --> 4777.83
good thing

4775.75 --> 4782.61
and

4777.83 --> 4787.71
should do it more often so yeah phrase

4782.61 --> 4794.759999999999
the path and thank Christ for for

4787.71 --> 4797.45
showing himself and the way and yeah if

4794.76 --> 4800.97
you are being troubled if you are

4797.45 --> 4804.36
touched by the evil ones then just ask

4800.97 --> 4809.22
the Archangel Michael Archangel of

4804.36 --> 4813.92
Justice to sever those dark ties and

4809.22 --> 4817.4400000000005
help you return to the path of the light

4813.92 --> 4819.78
yeah that's what I do a lot that's part

4817.44 --> 4823.79
of the disciplines part of what my

4819.78 --> 4826.29
healer does he doesn't directly he is I

4823.79 --> 4827.88
don't know what he is but it's amazing

4826.29 --> 4830.73
and I want to be like that as well

4827.88 --> 4834.99
he's been added for his entire life

4830.73 --> 4837.509999999999
pretty much since 60 years incredible

4834.99 --> 4841.41
what yeah

4837.51 --> 4846.54
now you can call it yahushua you can

4841.41 --> 4848.76
call it Jesus Christ it's mine Lee just

4846.54 --> 4852.9
about that frequency about that energy

4848.76 --> 4855.150000000001
and the word Jesus Christ for me in my

4852.9 --> 4860.73
memory worked it is one of those words

4855.15 --> 4863.25
and I don't know I've never even tried

4860.73 --> 4865.919999999999
really yeah Joshua I never tried that I

4863.25 --> 4868.35
don't know if I don't know if it's the

4865.92 --> 4873.93
same I've never gotten to that point but

4868.35 --> 4877.410000000001
anyway yeah praise Him and let's do what

4873.93 --> 4879.539000000001
we are destined to do in this creation

4877.41 --> 4882.3
[Music]

4879.539 --> 4888.3
see what we can all together get out of

4882.3 --> 4890.070000000001
it an intention is very important the

4888.3 --> 4894.84
fact that you're intending to talk to

4890.07 --> 4897.179
that one regardless of what name you

4894.84 --> 4902.579
call him as long as you know who you're

4897.179 --> 4904.139
trying to contact yes languages are

4902.579 --> 4910.59
different that that doesn't mean you're

4904.139 --> 4913.619
not talking about the same one and again

4910.59 --> 4916.76
by their deeds you shall know them the

4913.619 --> 4916.759999999999
deeds show everything

4917.03 --> 4924.449
so another axiom that he is not mocked

4921.78 --> 4928.409
in other words you can't fool him what

4924.449 --> 4932.96
seeds you plant you will reap that is an

4928.409 --> 4932.96
axiom of spiritual and physical

4939.11 --> 4947.159
well thanks for the wonderful interview

4944.219 --> 4950.159
