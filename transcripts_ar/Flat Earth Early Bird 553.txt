272.6 --> 280.38
seems like Thursday just almost skipped

276.51 --> 282.419
by but yesterday was was a really good

280.38 --> 285.87
day for me it was very active very

282.419 --> 289.26
focused and yeah the Flat Earth debates

285.87 --> 292.38
were very good so I'm pretty sure that

289.26 --> 294.389
nathan is gonna reuse that for the

292.38 --> 299.25
weekend show and it was a really good

294.389 --> 304.199
show so I'm gonna be watching back it's

299.25 --> 308.0
probably gonna be playing tomorrow it

304.199 --> 308.0
feels like Saturday already

315.82 --> 318.63
hmm

321.61 --> 331.629
feels like another day okay yeah well

325.449 --> 334.06
I'm pretty I'm just gonna I think I'll

331.629 --> 337.75
probably be a bit slower than yesterday

334.06 --> 339.069
I don't know maybe it's the heat maybe

337.75 --> 342.28
it's because I'm not wearing a white

339.069 --> 345.97
shirt maybe I should just put on a white

342.28 --> 349.419
shirt anyway it is it does feel a lot

345.97 --> 353.259
fresher but yeah when I go out shopping

349.419 --> 356.889
I don't wear with my white shirt it's

353.259 --> 363.33000000000004
just weird to me to do that

356.889 --> 363.33
yeah you can't what

368.169 --> 371.039
hmm

374.97 --> 381.52000000000004
you can't go or do anything with your

378.21 --> 384.69
family's new what do you mean

381.52 --> 384.69
[Music]

397.21 --> 408.96999999999997
nothing is open okay well that doesn't

404.11 --> 414.18
seem to be an issue over here though the

408.97 --> 414.18
beaches no legs yeah that is weird

419.26 --> 428.95
died I can barely imagine like can't you

425.89 --> 434.34
just I don't know take the family and

428.95 --> 438.4
just go out somewhere very remote like

434.34 --> 440.40999999999997
way out of the reach of normal Oh your

438.4 --> 443.76
upstate New York okay yeah then you're

440.41 --> 443.76000000000005
gonna have to travel for a while

460.46 --> 467.2
the state of New York is [ __ ] okay

463.39 --> 470.33
well I can't testify to that

467.2 --> 474.28999999999996
yeah oh we're really there seems very

470.33 --> 477.91999999999996
little issue although social distancing

474.29 --> 482.95000000000005
nonsense is still kind of echoing on now

477.92 --> 488.90000000000003
officially the suppose that lockdown

482.95 --> 493.19
should be aa should be ending over here

488.9 --> 494.98999999999995
like June first officially but yeah

493.19 --> 498.65
there's still yeah there's still people

494.99 --> 501.17
even complaining about Oh keep your

498.65 --> 505.46
social distance like what is it

501.17 --> 507.53000000000003
yesterday there was a lady like in the

505.46 --> 510.89
supermarket that was like that to me you

507.53 --> 512.51
know it's just I just freeze in the

510.89 --> 516.47
moment because I'm like shocked that

512.51 --> 518.75
like I can't really confront them with

516.47 --> 522.26
it you know like right on the spot but

518.75 --> 525.8
I'm like what really you really think

522.26 --> 527.5699999999999
that that's that that's real not gonna

525.8 --> 529.31
tell them you know cuz usually the

527.57 --> 531.6800000000001
people that complain about that already

529.31 --> 535.81
have this look and energy that's just

531.68 --> 535.81
I'm not gonna get through to them anyway

537.43 --> 544.37
but that's still happening but

541.48 --> 546.59
effectively things are just open and it

544.37 --> 550.45
seems like the vast majority of people

546.59 --> 550.45
are just kind of ignoring it

554.61 --> 561.739
as far as I can tell

557.85 --> 561.739
[Music]

567.45 --> 577.1400000000001
hmm okay YouTube glad to hear you have

572.25 --> 580.11
good weather there even the malls are

577.14 --> 582.3199999999999
still closed okay Deb that is pretty

580.11 --> 582.32
bizarre

617.87 --> 620.65
hmm

629.89 --> 638.62
yeah yeah yeah that makes sense Guns of

632.74 --> 643.66
Navarone like the smaller inland towns

638.62 --> 645.82
and cities like there's already a

643.66 --> 651.85
natural distance just going on

645.82 --> 655.149
everywhere there so like I can't imagine

651.85 --> 657.899
anyone more inland really caring about

655.149 --> 660.519
this unless they're like completely

657.899 --> 668.769
preoccupied with media and television

660.519 --> 673.14
and all that maybe so many events

668.769 --> 677.29
canceled yeah that is that is also true

673.14 --> 680.05
and Robin Stanley I do hear like through

677.29 --> 683.4399999999999
radio that just happens to be on when I

680.05 --> 686.2299999999999
get in somewhere that kind of situation

683.44 --> 688.6600000000001
there are events also being canceled

686.23 --> 690.97
like usually the Netherlands has all

688.66 --> 693.49
these parties like these sort of

690.97 --> 696.61
festivals happening a lot of them all

693.49 --> 700.66
throughout the summer from spring yeah

696.61 --> 704.1990000000001
all the way until the very very end of

700.66 --> 706.959
summer and I have been hearing that

704.199 --> 711.3599999999999
there are like things getting canceled

706.959 --> 711.3599999999999
too not not everything I think but

719.75 --> 722.75
right

730.16 --> 738.52
right yeah including small things and so

735.86 --> 738.52
the NFL

738.92 --> 748.3
yeah but they need the information

742.22 --> 748.3000000000001
placements they're not gonna cancel that

748.36 --> 753.32
or who knows you know

750.56 --> 756.2299999999999
something like the NFL it's so highly

753.32 --> 760.4300000000001
sponsored and all that they could

756.23 --> 763.85
potentially even go for a a stadium with

760.43 --> 766.9699999999999
no crowd setting and then just have more

763.85 --> 770.8100000000001
cameras everywhere and then like you can

766.97 --> 775.7900000000001
now I don't know watch it in like a

770.81 --> 778.28
special pick your own camera view from

775.79 --> 783.88
your living room kind of thing I don't

778.28 --> 787.9399999999999
know maybe that already exists but yeah

783.88 --> 790.67
bigger events that have more money and

787.94 --> 792.5300000000001
more money for equipment can kind of

790.67 --> 802.49
potentially do that sort of thing if

792.53 --> 805.87
there is animal enough for it Korean

802.49 --> 805.87
baseball all right

821.6 --> 827.5790000000001
okay Hawks lucious transitioning to Flat

827.339 --> 828.7800000000001
Earth

827.579 --> 831.8399999999999
mm-hmm

828.78 --> 831.8399999999999
[Music]

832.99 --> 835.6800000000001
right

847.86 --> 860.66
I need to take a break sorry guys I'll

858.06 --> 860.66
be back

993.01 --> 996.46
and I'm back

1006.11 --> 1011.5600000000001
yeah the earned the coffee became a

1008.42 --> 1011.56
little bit too much there

1023.07 --> 1026.19
[Music]

1032.07 --> 1035.0
hmm

1048.1 --> 1055.6599999999999
scuba diving and found booze while scuba

1053.27 --> 1055.66
diving

1056.35 --> 1065.24
that's an interesting find like finding

1061.91 --> 1068.179
a closed bottle of booze like somewhere

1065.24 --> 1070.78
at the bottom of the ocean that's like

1068.179 --> 1070.7800000000002
hilarious

1077.68 --> 1080.8590000000002
[Music]

1096.89 --> 1100.7800000000002
oh okay

1101.13 --> 1109.42
[Music]

1114.94 --> 1122.03
well I used to do some snorkeling and

1119.15 --> 1132.6200000000001
diving but never like with the full

1122.03 --> 1137.54
breathing equipment like I I don't know

1132.62 --> 1142.04
why I think maybe it felt a little

1137.54 --> 1145.37
claustrophobic I think that I wouldn't

1142.04 --> 1147.05
feel like as nervous about doing

1145.37 --> 1152.51
something like that if I would try it

1147.05 --> 1156.26
now but like in my youth as a teenager

1152.51 --> 1157.87
like really deep water kind of made me

1156.26 --> 1161.68
nervous

1157.87 --> 1161.6799999999998
because of the lack of light

1167.62 --> 1174.039
but yes snorkeling in not too deep ocean

1171.49 --> 1177.039
water especially with rocks around and

1174.039 --> 1184.21
all that there's so much life it's very

1177.039 --> 1186.22
interesting a typical thing that I would

1184.21 --> 1192.159
be doing is just take like a knife with

1186.22 --> 1194.289
me and then start yeah open up a cockle

1192.159 --> 1195.0100000000002
or whatever and then just watch the

1194.289 --> 1199.15
fishes

1195.01 --> 1201.46
feed off that like suddenly you would

1199.15 --> 1203.3200000000002
see all these fishes that were there but

1201.46 --> 1205.1490000000001
they were kind of camouflaged and they

1203.32 --> 1206.98
were all suddenly start rushing towards

1205.149 --> 1217.6299999999999
that I always found that very

1206.98 --> 1225.33
fascinating to see that no a cockle like

1217.63 --> 1234.0900000000001
one of those black shells a barnacle

1225.33 --> 1234.09
what is it no I don't be ridiculous

1247.52 --> 1251.45
although you know when you're diving

1249.32 --> 1253.899
especially when you're at rocks and all

1251.45 --> 1258.1100000000001
that and when there's a lot of barnacles

1253.899 --> 1262.57
or whatever they're called yeah you do

1258.11 --> 1265.58
get caught it's very easy to get caught

1262.57 --> 1268.809
so but yeah I'm not gonna do that on

1265.58 --> 1268.809
purpose that's ridiculous

1271.61 --> 1277.7189999999998
[Music]

1284.43 --> 1287.519
[Music]

1307.76 --> 1317.09
no no essex no look I did that in Spain

1314.06 --> 1323.0
and at the East Coast it's kind of north

1317.09 --> 1330.53
of Barcelona and there were some really

1323.0 --> 1336.05
interesting yeah places rock formations

1330.53 --> 1340.8799999999999
there I could show that you smell a

1336.05 --> 1346.21
troll do you Steve yeah I smell it might

1340.88 --> 1346.21
be we'll figure it out

1359.26 --> 1366.539
no but anyway yeah you know I could

1361.899 --> 1369.76
actually show that I think Google Maps

1366.539 --> 1372.09
be interesting to look at it never look

1369.76 --> 1372.09
that up

1400.899 --> 1409.6
where was it again it was like way right

1412.21 --> 1429.52
very much in the north-northeast part

1419.76 --> 1436.33
trying to find the village Spain is so

1429.52 --> 1443.68
big you know ah there it is yeah

1436.33 --> 1446.31
familiar sights let's see if I can

1443.68 --> 1446.3100000000002
present that

1454.62 --> 1457.4599999999998
all right

1457.72 --> 1468.94
so this is where C is all the way like

1466.539 --> 1471.179
right at the border of the North pretty

1468.94 --> 1471.179
much

1471.269 --> 1479.169
Spain is just so incredibly fast and

1474.75 --> 1485.019
this area just this area seemed huge to

1479.169 --> 1491.7990000000002
me anyway this is like the place wait

1485.019 --> 1499.44
wait where was it ah I think I got lost

1491.799 --> 1499.44
again was it

1500.6 --> 1510.32
not there yeah right over there that

1505.21 --> 1514.22
Island so I recognize it and basically

1510.32 --> 1516.83
it was over here so there's this forest

1514.22 --> 1522.23
camping somewhere over here I think it's

1516.83 --> 1524.36
this no wait man it's been a long time

1522.23 --> 1528.59
since I look watched look at it but

1524.36 --> 1536.26
anyway here right over here there's this

1528.59 --> 1541.24
very interesting rocky beach place and

1536.26 --> 1541.24
like this is a beautiful rocky area

1542.8 --> 1557.87
let's see which Beach was it what was it

1545.78 --> 1560.12
this one right this is the one like this

1557.87 --> 1563.4499999999998
little yeah by the way this is also like

1560.12 --> 1566.8999999999999
a nude beach it was really isolated and

1563.45 --> 1568.94
but the thing was ya know my mother

1566.9 --> 1571.43
thought that was all great but I just

1568.94 --> 1574.94
did it because of the beautiful this

1571.43 --> 1578.42
rock over here I climbed this thing so

1574.94 --> 1581.54
many times and douve offer it into the

1578.42 --> 1591.41
ocean so this is like a really special

1581.54 --> 1595.58
place to me ya know this stuff temporary

1591.41 --> 1600.23
closed yeah I'll bet you but anyway yeah

1595.58 --> 1603.1599999999999
this over here and I one time I just

1600.23 --> 1607.04
went into the ocean here and just swam

1603.16 --> 1612.5600000000002
up until like here something like really

1607.04 --> 1616.1
crazy ly far away I think I explained

1612.56 --> 1618.2
that one time and that just seems insane

1616.1 --> 1620.4199999999998
when everything becomes so far away and

1618.2 --> 1624.6200000000001
you're literally your head is at ocean

1620.42 --> 1629.48
level and that makes it seem or even

1624.62 --> 1631.6699999999998
further away yeah and from this place I

1629.48 --> 1633.6200000000001
could always see this these islands of

1631.67 --> 1634.6100000000001
Earth's like these rocky islands pretty

1633.62 --> 1639.8
picture s

1634.61 --> 1641.78
and I tested my sights one time because

1639.8 --> 1646.58
there is a beach over here this is a

1641.78 --> 1655.58
very crowded beach Hey ooh look at that

1646.58 --> 1662.1999999999998
picture yes that's exactly that amazing

1655.58 --> 1662.1999999999998
but I watched from here all the way to

1662.71 --> 1673.13
like what was it all the way over here

1669.7 --> 1676.309
and I could literally just look at that

1673.13 --> 1680.39
with my eyes over that distance and make

1676.309 --> 1682.1
out what color pants and shirt somebody

1680.39 --> 1688.67
was wearing all the way over there with

1682.1 --> 1690.08
my own bare eyes how far is that yeah

1688.67 --> 1697.5500000000002
that's like at least two and a half

1690.08 --> 1700.73
miles anyway yeah this is a place that

1697.55 --> 1702.6789999999999
I've typically been to as a kid a lot a

1700.73 --> 1704.63
lot of summers had a lot of special

1702.679 --> 1707.99
moments here and it is an amazing

1704.63 --> 1715.2800000000002
looking place see if I can get some more

1707.99 --> 1718.309
for photographs it should be like a

1715.28 --> 1721.94
picture of this yeah see look at that

1718.309 --> 1722.48
and with those trees on top there as

1721.94 --> 1726.38
well

1722.48 --> 1731.84
so is this patch of trees on top it's

1726.38 --> 1735.2600000000002
just incredible looking and you can

1731.84 --> 1737.84
climb all the way around that I've done

1735.26 --> 1739.79
that so many times I speed climbed and

1737.84 --> 1743.9599999999998
that's like without ropes all the way

1739.79 --> 1749.75
around that rock and it would take me

1743.96 --> 1756.17
like eight minutes to get on that rock

1749.75 --> 1758.33
and then climb all the way around it yes

1756.17 --> 1762.749
that's the place where I dove off a lot

1758.33 --> 1768.399
of the times yeah

1762.749 --> 1776.32
anyway yeah that's blast from the past

1768.399 --> 1779.549
for me talking about beaches and going

1776.32 --> 1779.549
out in the summery weather

1805.19 --> 1813.3600000000001
well as socks Lucius it's really not

1808.619 --> 1815.61
interesting seriously I don't know if

1813.36 --> 1818.129
you've ever been at a nude beach but

1815.61 --> 1819.9599999999998
unless it's some squirting ground like

1818.129 --> 1823.08
the good connected than just sex around

1819.96 --> 1826.169
or whatever that type of Beach regular

1823.08 --> 1831.6589999999999
nude beaches just have a lot of people

1826.169 --> 1833.669
that just don't want to wear swimming

1831.659 --> 1836.3400000000001
stuff they just want to be nude and

1833.669 --> 1839.6390000000001
guess what they're often not incredibly

1836.34 --> 1843.1789999999999
good-looking people so if that's get you

1839.639 --> 1843.7099999999998
off then you've got another problem

1843.179 --> 1847.049
really

1843.71 --> 1851.309
because nude beaches are not like oh so

1847.049 --> 1853.23
sexy no not at all it's no I actually

1851.309 --> 1856.379
thought it was kind of disturbing but

1853.23 --> 1858.6
the location was just too good so I

1856.379 --> 1862.9499999999998
mostly just stared at the water and at

1858.6 --> 1865.98
rocks and I didn't go nude there I did

1862.95 --> 1871.23
it a couple of times basically as like

1865.98 --> 1874.08
yeah I'm not afraid kind of thing like I

1871.23 --> 1876.029
am proud but yeah that's been a thing

1874.08 --> 1878.9399999999998
for me so I didn't demonstratively a

1876.029 --> 1888.21
couple times but mostly like no that

1878.94 --> 1891.96
does not interest me at all do I dream

1888.21 --> 1896.97
English or Dutch that's that's a good

1891.96 --> 1901.519
question actually yeah I do dream

1896.97 --> 1905.549
English in a way it's like the first

1901.519 --> 1913.95
translation to me am i into some kind of

1905.549 --> 1919.799
language afton English I rarely dream

1913.95 --> 1924.179
Dutch it only really is like genuinely

1919.799 --> 1929.789
Dutch spoken if it is with distinctly

1924.179 --> 1931.5590000000002
Dutch people sometimes but yeah I don't

1929.789 --> 1934.049
know

1931.559 --> 1937.379
I talk so much English I speak with so

1934.049 --> 1942.269
many English people that and think about

1937.379 --> 1947.61
the world like also in an English way I

1942.269 --> 1950.36
guess so yeah I do the dreams and even

1947.61 --> 1958.59
the visions kind of do adapt to that

1950.36 --> 1961.559
frequency because of that I think if you

1958.59 --> 1963.499
dream Dutch it is a shared dream yeah

1961.559 --> 1974.19
that's a good one I get it

1963.499 --> 1977.159
yeah yeah that's a good one yeah that's

1974.19 --> 1981.749
a that's a that's a joke from short

1977.159 --> 1984.3790000000001
thornell it's about Dutch dating that's

1981.749 --> 1984.3790000000001
really funny

2008.33 --> 2012.97
I think I know who a sucks Lucy's is

2016.0 --> 2020.05
keep forgetting in the name though

2043.52 --> 2053.44
yeah YMCA had nude swimming for boys and

2050.27 --> 2053.44
men what

2063.929 --> 2067.339
had knew this

2071.69 --> 2078.679
yeah I I would have to know a little bit

2074.28 --> 2092.6290000000004
more before I started unleashing on that

2078.679 --> 2095.58
high yet but I so it was basically

2092.629 --> 2097.0499999999997
secret [ __ ] it's like okay yeah yeah

2095.58 --> 2099.5099999999998
that's alright because I thought that

2097.05 --> 2103.65
the YMCA is actually supposed to be very

2099.51 --> 2110.88
respectable organization so that that

2103.65 --> 2115.23
does sound like yeah that that seems

2110.88 --> 2119.46
like there's something really wrong that

2115.23 --> 2122.089
that just happened just like that it's

2119.46 --> 2122.089
kind of freaky

2127.809 --> 2136.25
like look in a way from a more

2133.25 --> 2139.43
responsible liberal perspective if you

2136.25 --> 2142.91
think that like nudist stuff should even

2139.43 --> 2144.8289999999997
be like okay why not kids nude like yeah

2142.91 --> 2149.75
a little kids they are nude they don't

2144.829 --> 2151.6400000000003
care they shouldn't but yeah when you're

2149.75 --> 2153.829
gonna have little kids that are

2151.64 --> 2157.42
supposedly nude you gotta have the

2153.829 --> 2164.3590000000004
parents there at least yeah absolutely

2157.42 --> 2167.7200000000003
because just gonna have some men that

2164.359 --> 2172.369
are nude near kids that are nude without

2167.72 --> 2176.2
parents having oversight that's yeah a

2172.369 --> 2176.2000000000003
bad situation waiting to happen

2202.09 --> 2209.65
google it so was it like a big scandal

2205.48 --> 2212.47
afterward or something now I'm not gonna

2209.65 --> 2216.85
google it because I really don't want to

2212.47 --> 2219.2799999999997
like start throwing and squirting over

2216.85 --> 2226.2999999999997
something bizarre that happened way way

2219.28 --> 2228.46
in the past but I am interested in

2226.3 --> 2235.59
basically understanding that you had the

2228.46 --> 2239.26
context and and then kind of drop it

2235.59 --> 2241.0
because yeah there's a lot of really

2239.26 --> 2244.1800000000003
[ __ ] up [ __ ] going down in the world

2241.0 --> 2247.93
and if you just spend all your time all

2244.18 --> 2249.8799999999997
day long looking one atrocity up after

2247.93 --> 2252.16
another yeah you're just gonna live in

2249.88 --> 2261.6600000000003
hell it's no use

2252.16 --> 2268.2
not gonna help anything okay sick

2261.66 --> 2272.77
unintentionally well if it is

2268.2 --> 2280.87
unintentional then and then how is it

2272.77 --> 2284.32
sick really if if there really was like

2280.87 --> 2287.0499999999997
there weren't any disgusting [ __ ] going

2284.32 --> 2289.63
on or whatever in secret and it was like

2287.05 --> 2291.96
no we're just gonna be nudists and we're

2289.63 --> 2295.33
all we're not gonna make it about sex

2291.96 --> 2297.46
then yeah it does seem like oh it's

2295.33 --> 2302.41
gonna make the puppets dance big time of

2297.46 --> 2304.39
course but as long as there's no reaping

2302.41 --> 2307.39
going on or whatever you know which

2304.39 --> 2313.77
would that's what it is when you have

2307.39 --> 2313.77
sex with with a non-adult right yeah

2318.369 --> 2321.94
wrong context

2328.4 --> 2331.4
right

2332.02 --> 2340.17
that's I maybe yeah maybe I'm just not

2336.43 --> 2340.1699999999996
getting this what you're talking about

2370.71 --> 2379.5
I know Guns of Navarone I disagree I

2376.61 --> 2384.27
don't think that that is how that works

2379.5 --> 2386.34
at all because yeah if you're like a man

2384.27 --> 2389.85
or a pervy man or whatever and you're

2386.34 --> 2392.1000000000004
gonna be there at a nude situation and

2389.85 --> 2394.5899999999997
then freaking have a boner from watching

2392.1 --> 2396.5899999999997
little kids or something you're gonna be

2394.59 --> 2399.96
in trouble one way or another

2396.59 --> 2407.4
you know so that seems extremely

2399.96 --> 2411.05
unlikely what you imagine the see this

2407.4 --> 2413.4
our imagine pulls us into like our

2411.05 --> 2420.11
scenarios that are absolutely

2413.4 --> 2420.11
unrealistic like that doesn't happen

2421.28 --> 2429.42
what predators would do is do that [ __ ]

2425.64 --> 2431.33
in secret because then if they have a

2429.42 --> 2434.52
freaking bone or whatever

2431.33 --> 2438.45
yeah it's there's not a lot of people

2434.52 --> 2439.77
around that are gonna tell you no yeah I

2438.45 --> 2441.87
don't even want to think about it but

2439.77 --> 2444.39
it's not like oh there is a nude

2441.87 --> 2446.67
swimming event oh that's all the

2444.39 --> 2450.72
creepies come out and have their boner

2446.67 --> 2452.69
in public no that's not how that works

2450.72 --> 2455.37
if it does they'll get in trouble

2452.69 --> 2458.58
because yeah there's gonna be men that

2455.37 --> 2472.83
are gonna be like no you're not gonna be

2458.58 --> 2474.24
near any kids yeah stop the topic I get

2472.83 --> 2484.0699999999997
that it did this is getting a bit

2474.24 --> 2484.0699999999997
disturbing and weird

2513.04 --> 2517.0099999999998
[Music]

2527.94 --> 2530.9790000000003
[Music]

2531.53 --> 2539.2200000000003
right in the 60s yeah but look the 60s

2535.73 --> 2542.22
that was just like the Tavistock sexual

2539.22 --> 2545.8799999999997
revolution remember so it's like no

2542.22 --> 2549.1499999999996
everything is okay now like yeah you

2545.88 --> 2552.21
could just have sex in any way with

2549.15 --> 2555.03
everyone and whatever you want so yeah

2552.21 --> 2564.12
of course suddenly that [ __ ] happened it

2555.03 --> 2568.4
was a revolution it was the great squirt

2564.12 --> 2568.4
revolution of the 20th century

2585.63 --> 2591.77
no Essex I why would you say that

2614.84 --> 2620.58
yeah stop a traffic and my rest head I

2617.73 --> 2622.86
don't know how it came to it oh yeah we

2620.58 --> 2625.65
were talking about going out and then

2622.86 --> 2628.65
beaches being closed and then I

2625.65 --> 2630.51
basically referenced to a great beach

2628.65 --> 2633.48
that I wanted to kind of look up on

2630.51 --> 2636.3
Google Maps from where I went a lot with

2633.48 --> 2639.21
my parents in the past as a kid and then

2636.3 --> 2642.59
was reminded that it's actually a nude

2639.21 --> 2647.61
beach and then somehow that moved on to

2642.59 --> 2649.77
dirty new situations and dubious setups

2647.61 --> 2651.869
in the sixties for some reason and then

2649.77 --> 2654.65
everybody went all squirty obsessing

2651.869 --> 2654.65
over pedos

2661.94 --> 2665.78
[Music]

2669.579 --> 2674.8900000000003
yeah I did the talking but I am

2672.349 --> 2678.1400000000003
basically responding to chat you know

2674.89 --> 2680.3289999999997

2678.14 --> 2683.449

2680.329 --> 2686.2690000000002
share so yeah that's what I do I've had

2683.449 --> 2689.7090000000003

that early on like there's there's a

2845.31 --> 2849.96
