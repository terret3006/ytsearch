417.44 --> 422.71

420.16 --> 426.35
sense that that that's

422.71 --> 426.34999999999997
[Music]

here I do want to say like I am really

450.28 --> 455.31899999999996
happy though

452.24 --> 457.8
with the collection of people that have

455.319 --> 460.84000000000003
that we've gathered up

457.8 --> 464.639
here it's like new people trying their

460.84 --> 466.159
way in all the time and and then I often

464.639 --> 469.84000000000003
kick them

466.159 --> 472.639
out and even regular Richard

469.84 --> 475.039
here who I know first from my comment

472.639 --> 478.159
section I was kind of

475.039 --> 481.31899999999996
like not sure about that guy but he

478.159 --> 481.319
seems okay

482.199 --> 487.56
and now he's showing up in chat more

484.599 --> 487.56
often and that's

488.199 --> 494.599
cool and I'm really happy about dupons

491.159 --> 496.4
being part of the team now I had to

494.599 --> 500.36
protect him at first but I'm just really

496.4 --> 503.44
happy I did because he's a cool guy and

500.36 --> 503.44
he's actually kind of

508.24 --> 512.32
smart

509.879 --> 514.599
in a in a creative way which I really

512.32 --> 517.519
like that type of

514.599 --> 520.159
smart right and of course Richie G man

517.519 --> 524.0
dude it's kind of weird to say but like

520.159 --> 524.0
yeah we've gone through a lot

524.16 --> 528.68
together and Richard he is kind of the

526.519 --> 532.72
guy that I mostly remember sticking with

528.68 --> 536.0
me like through all the damn infighting

532.72 --> 536.0
crap across

538.2 --> 542.36
channels

540.0 --> 546.12
like which I'm

542.36 --> 549.36
like like kind of impressed over right

546.12 --> 552.079
because hey I am not the perfect guy or

549.36 --> 552.0790000000001
anything

554.72 --> 560.0
I yeah well when I go on a rage I just

557.519 --> 561.92
go too far and [ __ ] and I make things

560.0 --> 565.2
ugly

561.92 --> 566.8389999999999
and and like yeah then I It's just

565.2 --> 569.839
sometimes I'm a mess and I'm really

566.839 --> 572.5600000000001
happy that Richard G is stuck with me

569.839 --> 572.5600000000001
despite all

574.72 --> 581.5600000000001
that and he's been very understanding so

578.56 --> 581.56
hello

582.88 --> 585.88
sag

586.04 --> 591.8389999999999
s

587.959 --> 591.8389999999999
what did I say that

593.16 --> 597.64
right or is it Sage

598.12 --> 602.72
leby

599.64 --> 606.56
I'm not sure what the root of that name

602.72 --> 606.5600000000001
is linguistics

607.6 --> 612.839
wise everybody has their breaker points

610.8 --> 616.04
yeah

612.839 --> 616.0400000000001
but you

619.76 --> 624.76
know it's quite a hassle with me I mean

623.36 --> 627.44
a lot of people have their trigger

624.76 --> 627.4399999999999
points and

628.04 --> 633.079
then yeah it

630.13 --> 636.48
[Music]

633.079 --> 638.68
just they kind of just move on and I try

636.48 --> 641.8000000000001
to kind of move on but sometimes it just

638.68 --> 641.8
doesn't really work that

642.04 --> 646.8389999999999
well in certain days like my

644.56 --> 648.4799999999999
concentration is really badly broken

646.839 --> 652.12
because of freaking

648.48 --> 655.6
trolls and it's such a shame that that

652.12 --> 657.92
happens but it does happen

655.6 --> 660.6
unfortunately cuz some days I just like

657.92 --> 663.24
I can't steal create very subtle

660.6 --> 665.519
thoughts but I'm basically holding back

663.24 --> 667.76
a big cloud in the background and if the

665.519 --> 669.6
trolls go doing that then I just can't

667.76 --> 673.24
focus anymore on the

669.6 --> 676.0790000000001
subtleties and that and then yeah

673.24 --> 676.0790000000001
rowdiness

676.56 --> 682.3599999999999
happens unfortunately and I'm really

679.36 --> 684.639
thinking about how how can I resolve

682.36 --> 684.639
this

687.959 --> 690.959
issue

692.68 --> 697.12
I mean I'm not going to resolve the

694.16 --> 701.36
issue of certain people just hating

697.12 --> 701.36
me for no logical

701.56 --> 707.399
reason like well you might hate me but I

705.48 --> 709.0790000000001
mean if you hate somebody you usually

707.399 --> 711.8
kind of like leave him alone you know

709.079 --> 714.56
that's healthier for you like why would

711.8 --> 717.56
you do that but there's people like that

714.56 --> 719.6389999999999
still send me all these

717.56 --> 721.959
emails like I can't can't do anything

719.639 --> 725.04
about that but what I can do anything

721.959 --> 725.04
something about is

730.279 --> 737.8389999999999
just not being

733.56 --> 739.92
disrupted anymore somehow or getting a

737.839 --> 741.9200000000001
better protocol when I'm just too

739.92 --> 745.76
vulnerable basically

741.92 --> 745.76
and something to

747.88 --> 753.519
avoid all the

751.399 --> 755.48
hassle I'm trying I'm just thinking

753.519 --> 759.48
about it I mean this it doesn't really

755.48 --> 762.32
have any form yet I'm thinking about it

759.48 --> 763.44
because I do require yeah I do regard it

762.32 --> 765.639
as a

763.44 --> 769.44
problem and a problem that I've been

765.639 --> 771.48
having for quite a time some time and it

769.44 --> 773.8000000000001
weirdly enough I've never had this

771.48 --> 776.32
problem before like

773.8 --> 778.68
this because there's nothing that I've

776.32 --> 781.88
stuck to like the early word show as

778.68 --> 784.3199999999999
long long I can even

781.88 --> 787.76
say

784.32 --> 792.44
that well I've never had a job that long

787.76 --> 795.36
in order to have to test this never come

792.44 --> 797.1600000000001
to a position where it's just like this

795.36 --> 799.639
where you just something you do every

797.16 --> 803.16
day it's a

799.639 --> 805.6
default I haven't really come to that

803.16 --> 808.959
with any job which is also kind of

805.6 --> 812.0400000000001
disappointing and at times I was so was

808.959 --> 815.0
wondering like why not why can't I just

812.04 --> 817.12
like what do people expect that you just

815.0 --> 820.68
drop on your knees oh please can I still

817.12 --> 825.36
have my job or

820.68 --> 825.3599999999999
something when I'm just doing my

826.959 --> 832.279
best I don't

829.6 --> 835.8000000000001
know and like it's not even like oh I

832.279 --> 839.519
come late all the time no no I

835.8 --> 841.0
don't I come late here but

839.519 --> 845.12
I

841.0 --> 847.24
mean I just can't be ar I just do it

845.12 --> 850.68
it's just the way it

847.24 --> 850.6800000000001
is right I

854.12 --> 860.279
mean I'm not going to like really drum

857.48 --> 862.9200000000001
myself up to make sure that I like don't

860.279 --> 866.6
get laid on my own show because then

862.92 --> 867.4799999999999
that drumming would also cause hassle

866.6 --> 870.48
for

867.48 --> 872.759
me it would make me sometimes really

870.48 --> 875.16
frustrated or like

872.759 --> 877.6
extra problems with

875.16 --> 880.6
concentration cuz there is this

877.6 --> 884.0790000000001
like phase before the show where I have

880.6 --> 886.48
to like attune like get into the

884.079 --> 889.92
position mentally and spiritually to

886.48 --> 893.1990000000001
like start doing this get in the mode

889.92 --> 895.8
and you can't rush that if you're if I

893.199 --> 900.199
like started before I'm like

895.8 --> 903.16
ready like I can be like really

900.199 --> 906.0
flustered for quite a for like half an

903.16 --> 908.92
hour or more like really

906.0 --> 911.759
flustered

908.92 --> 915.04
so I'm just doing the

911.759 --> 919.1990000000001
show as well as I can and I try to be as

915.04 --> 919.199
close to the normal starting time as I

927.6 --> 930.6
can

933.399 --> 940.36
maybe don't feed the trolls well I don't

936.0 --> 941.88
really feed them duper I mean my rage

940.36 --> 946.0790000000001
can feed

941.88 --> 946.079
them but I try to avoid

948.839 --> 955.12
that like I try to avoid getting angry

952.92 --> 958.8
trolls pop

955.12 --> 961.44
up I usually block them and immediately

958.8 --> 961.4399999999999
forget about

965.62 --> 968.74

1251.559 --> 1257.36
here just as

1254.76 --> 1260.08
normal pretty damn sure my computer's

1257.36 --> 1262.9189999999999
not going to crash and breakdown and

1260.08 --> 1262.9189999999999
I'll be here

1264.84 --> 1272.1999999999998
and anybody wants to like talk to me

1269.279 --> 1275.799
join in a conversation even you could

1272.2 --> 1278.44
even try to ask me on Skype like hey

1275.799 --> 1278.44
want to call

1278.919 --> 1284.3600000000001
in contact me there I got a lot of

1281.4 --> 1287.48
contacts on there by

1284.36 --> 1289.52
now like steam traveler Richard G and

1287.48 --> 1292.4
clutch and

1289.52 --> 1292.4
a bunch of other

1293.44 --> 1298.72
people and I've had like original dros

1297.6 --> 1302.52
on

1298.72 --> 1306.0
before love to have that

1302.52 --> 1307.44
again or somebody else maybe clutch

1306.0 --> 1309.6
wants to call in

1307.44 --> 1311.25
sometime

1309.6 --> 1317.039
maybe

1311.25 --> 1320.039
[Music]

1317.039 --> 1320.039
right

1322.08 --> 1326.6789999999999
all right anyway

1323.52 --> 1329.1589999999999
yesterday I was also like at for of

1326.679 --> 1331.6000000000001
democracy it has a YouTube channel and

1329.159 --> 1336.279
they like PR play premieres and

1331.6 --> 1336.279
sometimes they play actual live

1338.23 --> 1346.67
[Music]

1346.96 --> 1352.829
streams

1348.3 --> 1352.829
[Music]

1357.24 --> 1361.76
but yeah yesterday that was kind of

1359.159 --> 1363.3200000000002
funny I got a timeout from them though I

1361.76 --> 1365.4
thought they banned me but they didn't

1363.32 --> 1367.799
it was a timeout a short

1365.4 --> 1371.5590000000002
timeout apparently they did not

1367.799 --> 1373.76
appreciate me kind of like casually

1371.559 --> 1375.84
talking about Jews and saying like well

1373.76 --> 1378.0
yeah you can make jokes about them

1375.84 --> 1378.8799999999999
apparently they were like really didn't

1378.0 --> 1381.279
want

1378.88 --> 1382.3200000000002
that but then I just stopped talking

1381.279 --> 1386.159
about

1382.32 --> 1389.4399999999998
it I mean I wasn't even like ridiculing

1386.159 --> 1391.6000000000001
him or anything it's just like they were

1389.44 --> 1393.4
saying like oh no you can't make fun of

1391.6 --> 1396.0
social media or like you'll never see

1393.4 --> 1398.279
the end of it and like oh no I can make

1396.0 --> 1402.4
fun of it I

1398.279 --> 1404.88
mean just don't name him by name and

1402.4 --> 1408.3600000000001
don't like you just got to be careful

1404.88 --> 1412.279
how you do it like best to just stick to

1408.36 --> 1417.0
the description of a certain behavioral

1412.279 --> 1417.0
type and then like yeah that's

1419.32 --> 1423.6
fine

1421.24 --> 1425.84
right but yeah that was kind of funny

1423.6 --> 1425.84
for

1428.4 --> 1431.4
me

1431.919 --> 1435.88
uh s of Flat Earth

1436.24 --> 1439.88
debates premier

1441.44 --> 1444.6000000000001
last

1442.279 --> 1448.159
night where was

1444.6 --> 1450.52
it yeah that's kind of weird this whole

1448.159 --> 1452.5200000000002
discussion with between Nathan and

1450.52 --> 1455.52
righteous Force about the housekeeping

1452.52 --> 1458.52
questions and like how I just thought

1455.52 --> 1461.32
that the housekeeping questions

1458.52 --> 1463.9189999999999
actually made a lot of people abandon

1461.32 --> 1465.6399999999999
Flat Earth debates that was kind of a

1463.919 --> 1468.64
weird show to listen

1465.64 --> 1470.5590000000002
to but interesting though that

1468.64 --> 1473.679
interesting

1470.559 --> 1477.52
discussion like is that

1473.679 --> 1481.0
true I thought it was a little

1477.52 --> 1481.0
boring for a

1481.919 --> 1488.159
while but I mean housekeeping wasn't the

1484.72 --> 1489.799
only thing that we were doing though and

1488.159 --> 1492.96
sometimes it was really short and

1489.799 --> 1492.96
sometimes it was very

1496.76 --> 1499.76
long

1502.94 --> 1507.72
[Music]

1504.32 --> 1510.559
what fight the flat claims focal

1507.72 --> 1513.559
pendulum can predict

1510.559 --> 1513.559
latitude

1514.799 --> 1521.279
wow is there any evidence for that well

1518.679 --> 1525.0
probably in his mind he thinks there is

1521.279 --> 1525.0
but I mean that is really

1526.679 --> 1531.44
hilarious

1528.64 --> 1533.5200000000002
I mean hey if things were

1531.44 --> 1535.3600000000001
actually if the Earth was actually

1533.52 --> 1538.44
spitting underneath the pendulum then

1535.36 --> 1540.039
maybe you could then maybe you could

1538.44 --> 1545.24
determine the

1540.039 --> 1547.12
latitude yeah on the ball earth

1545.24 --> 1549.559
except

1547.12 --> 1551.279
uh don't think that the Earth is

1549.559 --> 1553.6399999999999
actually turning underneath the pendulum

1551.279 --> 1555.84
because if the would then there would be

1553.64 --> 1557.64
standard coris deviation and the Earth

1555.84 --> 1560.4399999999998
would also be moving underneath hel

1557.64 --> 1564.1200000000001
helicopters airplanes and drones

1560.44 --> 1564.1200000000001
and and that's not

1566.159 --> 1574.1200000000001
happening too much repetition with

1570.52 --> 1577.44
Nathan hey repetition is how you really

1574.12 --> 1578.6699999999998
get to know the point sometimes hello

1577.44 --> 1581.739
har will not be

1578.67 --> 1581.739
[Music]

1583.12 --> 1589.2399999999998
silent I mean yeah repetition might be a

1586.399 --> 1591.52
little boring but especially for the

1589.24 --> 1593.64
people that are slower Learners

1591.52 --> 1597.799
or right hard

1593.64 --> 1597.7990000000002
learned it can really

1601.399 --> 1607.279
help but it did also make me think that

1604.96 --> 1611.64
yeah the housekeeping question is really

1607.279 --> 1615.88
fundamental really good but it's

1611.64 --> 1618.2
like the globers have just festered on

1615.88 --> 1621.7990000000002
and imagined on Beyond

1618.2 --> 1624.6000000000001
with like hyper convoluted

1621.799 --> 1626.559
arguments where double think really gets

1624.6 --> 1629.9189999999999
integrated into it

1626.559 --> 1632.32
too but they have just persistently kept

1629.919 --> 1634.48
going so now every time somebody says

1632.32 --> 1637.6399999999999
one of those freaking arguments you get

1634.48 --> 1641.52
a whole train of nonsense in

1637.64 --> 1645.48
response which makes it very very

1641.52 --> 1648.559
tiresome it's kind of rule of fist with

1645.48 --> 1650.96
globers it's just very very tiresome to

1648.559 --> 1650.96
deal with

1651.919 --> 1659.44
him cuz if they can't get a straight out

1655.6 --> 1660.279
win they'll just make up enormous amount

1659.44 --> 1662.96
of

1660.279 --> 1666.44
surreal mathematical

1662.96 --> 1669.0
nonsense just to try to justify

1666.44 --> 1671.0800000000002
why they couldn't just get a

1669.0 --> 1674.0
straightforward win and then they hold

1671.08 --> 1675.799
on to that like that is now their win

1674.0 --> 1677.76
the giant train of

1675.799 --> 1681.12
nonsense you're going to need a Flat

1677.76 --> 1681.12
Earth for that yeah of

1684.279 --> 1689.08
course but I mean they'll happily ignore

1691.279 --> 1694.279
that

1694.32 --> 1700.84
right just like my

1696.559 --> 1700.84
title from when is it two days

1701.36 --> 1709.4399999999998
ago 90 degrees doesn't mean flat

1705.32 --> 1709.4399999999998
according to akumu virus at the time

1710.24 --> 1714.84
like they just don't care they're just

1712.64 --> 1716.159
ignoring it it's like oh no we then we

1714.84 --> 1718.12
just don't need it anymore we're just

1716.159 --> 1719.679
going to take a little cross in a 90°

1718.12 --> 1721.84
and it has nothing to do with the shap

1719.679 --> 1725.6000000000001
of the

1721.84 --> 1725.6
earth you know how it

1725.92 --> 1729.019
[Music]

1735.32 --> 1741.2
goes if they can't you use it anymore to

1738.799 --> 1743.96
prove a globe then they just don't use

1741.2 --> 1748.159
it anymore and they'll prove the Earth

1743.96 --> 1750.88
is a globe and everything into like an

1748.159 --> 1754.1200000000001
advanced total solipsistic reversal

1750.88 --> 1756.679
State like even if like nothing is real

1754.12 --> 1758.5189999999998
anymore then from within that nothing is

1756.679 --> 1761.159
real anymore they'll still be able to

1758.519 --> 1766.3990000000001
prove that it's a globe to

1761.159 --> 1769.3200000000002
them like like they won't let reason

1766.399 --> 1771.8799999999999
take the globe from them that actually

1769.32 --> 1771.8799999999999
make a good

1777.13 --> 1796.3200000000002
[Music]

1790.37 --> 1799.32
[Laughter]

1796.32 --> 1799.32
title

1803.559 --> 1808.799
yeah they won't let reason and logic

1805.72 --> 1808.799
take their Globe from

1812.49 --> 1815.549
[Music]

1817.78 --> 1820.829
[Music]

1826.24 --> 1830.96
them

1828.0 --> 1830.96
whoa I got an

1832.84 --> 1837.52
ad I'm repeating what they say every day

1836.24 --> 1838.96
at every

1837.52 --> 1844.2
[Music]

1838.96 --> 1844.2
what you are are will not be silent

1845.34 --> 1855.4399999999998
[Music]

1850.399 --> 1858.279
okay that's hilarious yeah fight the fat

1855.44 --> 1861.0
Muppet but I mean yeah

1858.279 --> 1864.48
I mean look the funny thing is he's just

1861.0 --> 1867.72
got he's just gotten the Plaid hyper

1864.48 --> 1870.6
hypothetical like yeah he's reason out

1867.72 --> 1873.279
if you were on a globe that was spinning

1870.6 --> 1876.279
then what he's saying would probably

1873.279 --> 1878.6
work

1876.279 --> 1880.96
logically

1878.6 --> 1882.84
however the Earth isn't spinning

1880.96 --> 1885.799
underneath the pendulum because if it

1882.84 --> 1888.72
were you would have a standard coris

1885.799 --> 1890.96
deviation of everything that in the air

1888.72 --> 1894.3990000000001
like airplanes and helicopters and

1890.96 --> 1894.3990000000001
drones and we

1894.84 --> 1900.76
don't so that's the end of

1898.399 --> 1903.039
that can't use the Earth spinning

1900.76 --> 1905.1589999999999
underneath the pendulum to prove what

1903.039 --> 1907.76
latitude you are

1905.159 --> 1910.3600000000001
because there's consequences of that and

1907.76 --> 1912.2
those consequences do not exist in the

1910.36 --> 1914.7199999999998
real world there's

1912.2 --> 1916.919
no objects in the air

1914.72 --> 1921.159
deviating because of the Earth moving

1916.919 --> 1921.159
under underneath it it's just not

1929.679 --> 1934.88
happening need repetition yeah the

1932.159 --> 1937.24
Baseline claim especially yeah yeah yeah

1934.88 --> 1940.159
no I mean globers is just like they

1937.24 --> 1941.159
don't accept it it's like No this must

1940.159 --> 1943.0390000000002
be some

1941.159 --> 1946.679
trick

1943.039 --> 1948.44
like no you could just do a baseline

1946.679 --> 1950.0
like a curve based line why why can't

1948.44 --> 1953.0
you take an angle to a curve based line

1950.0 --> 1956.159
it's like why does the program not do

1953.0 --> 1958.0
it that's like an error like it's an

1956.159 --> 1961.0390000000002
error that it can't do it you should be

1958.0 --> 1964.48
able to do it but that's because they

1961.039 --> 1966.76
don't realize that the program doesn't

1964.48 --> 1969.76
compartmentalize the

1966.76 --> 1971.84
geometry in two factions in like one in

1969.76 --> 1974.36
which it's flat and one in which that

1971.84 --> 1976.519
flatness is calculated into a globe like

1974.36 --> 1978.24
that computer that's trying to measure

1976.519 --> 1981.84
the angle to the

1978.24 --> 1985.36
Baseline it doesn't compartmentalize it

1981.84 --> 1988.48
it just takes the geometry and then it

1985.36 --> 1990.4799999999998
doesn't work and then like hey program

1988.48 --> 1993.3990000000001
why don't you compart why don't you in

1990.48 --> 1995.32
your mind turn it into a flat plane and

1993.399 --> 1998.6789999999999
then it you can do it why aren't you

1995.32 --> 2000.9189999999999
doing that how dare you computer program

1998.679 --> 2004.3200000000002
you need to properly compartmentalize

2000.919 --> 2004.3200000000002
the geometric reality

2005.72 --> 2008.96
here uh

2009.279 --> 2012.88
yeah the atmosphere is yeah but it can't

2011.24 --> 2016.2
though it's absolute

2012.88 --> 2020.7600000000002
nonsense yeah air doesn't have momentum

2016.2 --> 2023.44
at all or Bumble like at

2020.76 --> 2026.0
all it only responds to local air

2023.44 --> 2028.88
pressure differential if air would be

2026.0 --> 2030.799
moving due to corel's deviation of the

2028.88 --> 2034.72
Earth moving underneath then two people

2030.799 --> 2037.48
on the Earth it would always be always

2034.72 --> 2040.919
never never an exception the wind would

2037.48 --> 2044.3990000000001
be going in One Direction and it would

2040.919 --> 2048.44
never ever

2044.399 --> 2052.52
stop because air doesn't attain momentum

2048.44 --> 2055.04
the only momentum that air can attain is

2052.52 --> 2059.52
being continually pushed pushed by a

2055.04 --> 2062.119
container that physically pushes the air

2059.52 --> 2064.879
that cannot Escape around the pushing

2062.119 --> 2067.679
Factor right because if you push air and

2064.879 --> 2069.399
can just move freely what does it do

2067.679 --> 2072.28
higher pressure here lower pressure

2069.399 --> 2075.0
there it immediately moves around it

2072.28 --> 2078.52
like like nothing

2075.0 --> 2081.0
happen yeah a short Breeze follows after

2078.52 --> 2083.24
the lower pressure Zone and then who it

2081.0 --> 2086.2
equalizes yeah because

2083.24 --> 2089.879
air yeah I can't do this and then the

2086.2 --> 2092.4399999999996
air is going to like Bo go all the way

2089.879 --> 2098.4
into the distance now air doesn't do

2092.44 --> 2102.52
that because gas doesn't Attain

2098.4 --> 2105.44
momentum yeah so it can't spin with

2102.52 --> 2107.92
anything either like not without

2105.44 --> 2110.359
something scooping the air up like a

2107.92 --> 2113.96
giant gigantic

2110.359 --> 2117.04
wall from the north to the South pushing

2113.96 --> 2119.2
forward a high pressure air front as

2117.04 --> 2122.56
it's supposedly spinning

2119.2 --> 2125.0789999999997
yeah we don't have a giant wall pushing

2122.56 --> 2128.48
forth the air in order to sort of have

2125.079 --> 2131.1600000000003
it make it spin with the root ating ball

2128.48 --> 2133.079
Earth so well there's nothing to push

2131.16 --> 2136.3999999999996
the air forward under presupposed

2133.079 --> 2139.079
spinning ball Earth so it can't just

2136.4 --> 2143.7200000000003
move in lock step because air like all

2139.079 --> 2146.76
gases don't attain momentum only solids

2143.72 --> 2146.7599999999998
and liquids do

2146.8 --> 2150.0
that all

2155.8 --> 2160.76
right

2157.76 --> 2160.76
I'm going to turn on my

2161.52 --> 2165.04
coffee be right

2185.72 --> 2188.72
back

2200.52 --> 2204.7599999999998
it's a good thing Akuma virus is still

2207.96 --> 2214.16
bad wind is not the same as yeah there

2211.24 --> 2218.2
is no momentum of atmosphere or in aqua

2214.16 --> 2221.48
wumble there's no momentum of gas

2218.2 --> 2224.68
and Atmos doesn't take the shape of a

2221.48 --> 2227.64
sphere unless it is in a physically

2224.68 --> 2227.64
sphere shaped

2245.599 --> 2250.96

2258.359 --> 2262.0789999999997
no this is

2263.04 --> 2267.88

2265.2 --> 2271.1189999999997
uh it might be my birthday but it's

2267.88 --> 2275.0
still just a

2271.119 --> 2275.0
show not a birthday

2275.4 --> 2279.56
party you're you're not getting into the

2277.52 --> 2282.92
argument well you already got into the

2279.56 --> 2284.7999999999997
argument and I refuted the argument yeah

2282.92 --> 2287.28
air doesn't attain momentum and neither

2284.8 --> 2287.28
does the

2287.839 --> 2292.44
atmosphere

2290.16 --> 2295.1189999999997
air remains

2292.44 --> 2298.88
stationary unless there's a pressure

2295.119 --> 2302.8
differential forcing it to

2298.88 --> 2305.319
equalize and thus move around that's how

2302.8 --> 2309.2400000000002
gases move

2305.319 --> 2309.24
around they don't build

2311.4 --> 2319.92
momentum but they can be continually

2315.079 --> 2323.48
pushed forth by physical

2319.92 --> 2325.599
walls right but even if you're like in a

2323.48 --> 2329.04
car and you're

2325.599 --> 2333.0
accelerating the air in the car closed

2329.04 --> 2336.68
off with windows closed will be pushed

2333.0 --> 2338.839
forth by the back side of the inside of

2336.68 --> 2338.839
the

2340.64 --> 2345.64
car

2342.64 --> 2349.68
yeah that's what actually makes it like

2345.64 --> 2349.68
it doesn't just move with the

2349.76 --> 2355.4
car just like

2352.88 --> 2358.079
that like nothing is pushing on it now

2355.4 --> 2360.04
it has to be pushed forth air has to be

2358.079 --> 2364.4
pushed to

2360.04 --> 2364.4
move without a push air doesn't

2365.44 --> 2370.839
move yeah because it doesn't have

2368.0 --> 2373.359
momentum it's basic

2370.839 --> 2377.0
physics air doesn't have momentum you

2373.359 --> 2377.0
need a push to make it

2395.4 --> 2398.4
move

2425.359 --> 2428.359
for

2434.28 --> 2438.2000000000003
yeah fight the fat mupp I hate that

2436.48 --> 2440.079
question too it's so

2438.2 --> 2444.2799999999997
convoluted

2440.079 --> 2447.2400000000002
like don't give them it there is no

2444.28 --> 2450.48
spinning with the Earth like that is a

2447.24 --> 2454.5989999999997
like a a brutal contradiction to like

2450.48 --> 2457.92
rudimentary physics Air does not attain

2454.599 --> 2461.6800000000003
momentum it just doesn't it can

2457.92 --> 2465.0
only keep moving if it is physically

2461.68 --> 2465.0
pushed that's what air

2467.24 --> 2473.9199999999996
does sailing ships are powered by the

2471.119 --> 2476.2000000000003
momentum of air yeah in all

2473.92 --> 2478.839
directions that that's cool it's not

2476.2 --> 2482.5989999999997
momentum though it's air

2478.839 --> 2483.56
pressure yeah and when it catches that

2482.599 --> 2486.319
air

2483.56 --> 2490.44
pressure then the air is actually BL

2486.319 --> 2493.48
blocked by the sails effectively in its

2490.44 --> 2496.28
motion which is moving towards the lower

2493.48 --> 2498.92
pressure Zone yeah to equalize the

2496.28 --> 2502.28
pressure that's what air does that's why

2498.92 --> 2504.16
it does get windy at times because the

2502.28 --> 2506.92
higher pressure Zone which build up

2504.16 --> 2509.96
probably due to heat influx wants to

2506.92 --> 2513.599
move to the lower pressure

2509.96 --> 2515.64
Zone and that takes a while it that gets

2513.599 --> 2517.48
it moving the whole body of the air

2515.64 --> 2519.48
starts moving moving towards the lower

2517.48 --> 2523.119
pressure Zone it takes a while it

2519.48 --> 2523.119
doesn't just explode there

2528.76 --> 2531.76
instantaneously

2531.88 --> 2540.359
yeah it's not momentum it's being sucked

2536.359 --> 2543.2799999999997
towards the lower pressure Zone that's a

2540.359 --> 2548.359
pressure redistribution that's happening

2543.28 --> 2551.4
not momentum it's not oh throw that air

2548.359 --> 2552.96
and it just keeps going no no no no

2551.4 --> 2553.92
that's not what air does that's not what

2552.96 --> 2556.559
gases

2553.92 --> 2558.599
do they go to the lower pressure Zone

2556.559 --> 2561.92
and as long as there is a lower pressure

2558.599 --> 2565.839
Zone then the air around that low

2561.92 --> 2567.6800000000003
pressure Zone will move towards it

2565.839 --> 2571.48
towards the lower pressure Zone that's

2567.68 --> 2571.48
the wind that we get to experience

2575.16 --> 2579.96
here

2577.4 --> 2579.96
through

2581.319 --> 2587.32
friction what

2584.4 --> 2590.4790000000003
friction air freak

2587.32 --> 2590.4790000000003
[Music]

2591.04 --> 2598.2799999999997
what what you think air has

2594.48 --> 2600.4
viscosity you can like hook a little air

2598.28 --> 2602.44
on the surface of Earth and then the

2600.4 --> 2605.8
rest of the air gets

2602.44 --> 2607.7200000000003
pulled because oh it pulled a little bit

2605.8 --> 2610.76
of air air and then just just scooped it

2607.72 --> 2612.8799999999997
and then one air got stuck to the other

2610.76 --> 2615.8390000000004
and it got sucked with like what the

2612.88 --> 2618.44
[ __ ] are you talking about it's one of

2615.839 --> 2623.52
the most ridiculous

2618.44 --> 2623.52
things ever heard a baller say

2624.599 --> 2630.96
what no you can't drag gases with you

2629.079 --> 2634.88
through

2630.96 --> 2638.079
friction the [ __ ] you know what friction

2634.88 --> 2638.079
is right

2638.599 --> 2646.559
like you need a

2640.96 --> 2651.04
surface you need a it's gas gas doesn't

2646.559 --> 2651.0400000000004
have friction like that that's

2656.079 --> 2659.079
ridiculous

2659.2 --> 2665.2
like you

2661.119 --> 2668.4
can't make the air stick and move with

2665.2 --> 2672.7599999999998
you like that it's not

2668.4 --> 2677.4
solid I mean liquids don't even do

2672.76 --> 2679.6800000000003
that how do they come up with this [ __ ]

2677.4 --> 2681.96
seriously hello slowmo moon buggy good

2679.68 --> 2681.96
to see

2684.96 --> 2693.44
you how do you get hot wind

2690.2 --> 2694.7999999999997
uh it's air that moving to a lower

2693.44 --> 2698.359
pressure

2694.8 --> 2701.2400000000002
Zone if it's warm like the overall

2698.359 --> 2704.88
temperature in the area is hot and so

2701.24 --> 2708.72
the air that moves through that space is

2704.88 --> 2708.7200000000003
hot there you go hot

2709.88 --> 2716.76
air I mean air can still heat up even as

2714.079 --> 2718.28
it is blowing I I mean they'll probably

2716.76 --> 2722.88
do something right

2718.28 --> 2726.2000000000003
because air heats up it also

2722.88 --> 2729.8
increases like the pressure a bit so it

2726.2 --> 2732.4399999999996
might have then a pressure

2729.8 --> 2734.319
differential influence on the entire

2732.44 --> 2736.76
pressure system so it might change the

2734.319 --> 2739.119
wind if there's like a heat

2736.76 --> 2742.079
influx but

2739.119 --> 2745.0
technically air is always really only

2742.079 --> 2746.6400000000003
concerned with higher pressure to lower

2745.0 --> 2748.96
pressure and that's the wind we

2746.64 --> 2751.5589999999997
experience there's a lot of it going on

2748.96 --> 2751.559
right now

2751.96 --> 2757.359
outside how about cold

2754.44 --> 2761.0
wind hot air

2757.359 --> 2761.0
rises that yeah that

2761.92 --> 2767.319
too cold air Falls yeah it's a dynamic

2767.559 --> 2775.4
system yeah but orino wumble don't you

2770.96 --> 2779.359
worry air doesn't have friction yeah

2775.4 --> 2781.7200000000003
friction is only reserved for solid

2779.359 --> 2783.92
matter seriously this is hilarious

2781.72 --> 2784.7999999999997
anyway I'm going to get my coffee be

2783.92 --> 2787.8

2969.48 --> 2974.559
okay

2971.839 --> 2976.72
har this computer

2974.559 --> 2979.7200000000003

2976.72 --> 2983.839
Live members only stream right

2979.72 --> 2983.839
now or it's just about to

2994.52 --> 3002.57

[Music]

3008.82 --> 3011.889
[Music]

3022.799 --> 3026.96
they used to say something about cons of

3024.599 --> 3028.599
eror mov yeah yeah yeah yeah the whole

3026.96 --> 3032.28
lockstep moving

3028.599 --> 3034.52
air I mean that was a an argument that

3032.28 --> 3039.3590000000004
even Ballwin would roll out and it would

3034.52 --> 3039.359
agitate Nathan greatly whenever I did

3039.4 --> 3045.799
that but I mean I have done several

3042.28 --> 3048.559
shows about how air doesn't attain

3045.799 --> 3050.559
momentum so how it can't be moving in

3048.559 --> 3053.96
luck step with a presupposed spherical

3050.559 --> 3053.96
earth like that's

3054.44 --> 3058.48
impossible doesn't respond like

3068.359 --> 3074.96
that it's like you want your spinning

3071.839 --> 3079.96
ball then you have to take the coris

3074.96 --> 3082.599
deviation in the air mechanics into

3079.96 --> 3084.96
account and realize also that in the

3082.599 --> 3087.28
very earlier stage of like the 60s

3084.96 --> 3089.599
program in even on the television shows

3087.28 --> 3094.2400000000002
like they would say

3089.599 --> 3096.4
it they wouldn't leave it out they would

3094.24 --> 3099.5989999999997
talk

3096.4 --> 3102.64
about the Cory yeah the the Earth moving

3099.599 --> 3102.6400000000003
underneath the air and

3146.72 --> 3150.0789999999997
so

3147.72 --> 3154.89
delayed it's

3150.079 --> 3157.6400000000003
ridiculous all right but yeah Kitty is

3157.64 --> 3165.0789999999997

3161.559 --> 3166.4
you oh he's behind it damn it I can't

3165.079 --> 3170.52
see

3166.4 --> 3174.04
him okay yeah you can see half the kitty

3170.52 --> 3174.04
there ah there he

3174.24 --> 3179.4799999999996
is

3176.28 --> 3183.3190000000004
this webcam wire is just

3179.48 --> 3183.319
terrible it's not long

3188.0 --> 3192.72
enough this is like of course an ideal

3190.68 --> 3194.839
spot for the cat to be right in front of

3192.72 --> 3194.839
the

3204.16 --> 3207.16
heater

3212.88 --> 3218.92
H

3215.4 --> 3221.6800000000003
what no fight the fat Muppet I I can't

3218.92 --> 3225.01
stand Rick and Morty I did is there an

3221.68 --> 3232.29
episode like that I have no

3225.01 --> 3232.2900000000004
[Music]

3234.16 --> 3237.16
idea

3244.599 --> 3247.799
KY don't do

3257.359 --> 3263.839
that no it does not have weight and it

3261.119 --> 3263.839
does not have

3264.079 --> 3268.119
momentum

3266.48 --> 3271.76
don't know what the hell you're quoting

3268.119 --> 3271.76
that from but it's complete

3277.72 --> 3284.04
nonsense am I going to be on longer yeah

3281.76 --> 3286.28
duh I mean my show is usually two to

3284.04 --> 3288.599
three

3286.28 --> 3291.079
hours but I'm not going to watch a Rick

3288.599 --> 3293.1600000000003
and Morty episode thanks I can't stand

3291.079 --> 3297.079
that show I don't want to advertise it I

3293.16 --> 3297.0789999999997
don't care if it has flatter [ __ ] in

3298.04 --> 3302.72
did but by all means share the episode

3301.16 --> 3306.5589999999997
number or

3302.72 --> 3306.5589999999997
whatever I'm not going to watch

3312.43 --> 3315.5499999999997
[Music]

3324.0 --> 3328.96
it

3325.839 --> 3328.96
oh she it's so

3344.2 --> 3347.2
cuddly

3353.599 --> 3361.039
okay it do no it

3357.68 --> 3364.3999999999996
doesn't air doesn't have momentum it

3361.039 --> 3367.2400000000002
just moves to the lower pressure

3364.4 --> 3370.079
zone now as it's moving it can still

3367.24 --> 3372.16
press things around I mean it is

3370.079 --> 3373.88
pressure what is air it's pressure

3372.16 --> 3376.64
what's gas it's

3373.88 --> 3378.1600000000003
pressure what is the quality it has it

3376.64 --> 3380.44
it does

3378.16 --> 3382.0789999999997
press and it overall presses on the

3380.44 --> 3385.64
walls of the container but there can

3382.079 --> 3388.48
still be different pressure zones Within

3385.64 --> 3391.96
the gas within a

3388.48 --> 3396.319
container usually because of

3391.96 --> 3396.319
temperature it does not attain

3397.839 --> 3402.7599999999998
momentum momentum would mean that it

3400.559 --> 3405.88
keeps

3402.76 --> 3410.0
going even when there's no lower

3405.88 --> 3413.0
pressure Zone it doesn't do

3410.0 --> 3413.0
that

3413.4 --> 3417.799
what oh okay duper

3420.16 --> 3427.3999999999996
huh it says all

3423.0 --> 3430.76
that well I don't know what it is harp I

3427.4 --> 3433.4
don't really care what it is it's wrong

3430.76 --> 3433.4
like that's

3433.64 --> 3439.5989999999997
wrong like I don't care I don't care if

3436.64 --> 3440.64
all of Wikipedia and all of Google and

3439.599 --> 3444.2400000000002
all the

3440.64 --> 3448.96
[ __ ] school curriculums all say that

3444.24 --> 3448.9599999999996
it's wrong it doesn't do

3449.119 --> 3455.7200000000003
that you don't have to put links it's

3453.24 --> 3458.0789999999997
wrong air doesn't have

3455.72 --> 3461.68
momentum only response to local air

3458.079 --> 3464.96
pressure differential it can't build

3461.68 --> 3467.3999999999996
momentum doesn't have

3464.96 --> 3470.2400000000002
mass it doesn't have

3467.4 --> 3472.64
weight definitely not gravity based

3470.24 --> 3475.0
weight if you're already inserting a

3472.64 --> 3477.2
source that basically claims it has

3475.0 --> 3479.039
weight then you already know what kind

3477.2 --> 3480.319
of ball tarded mechanics you're dealing

3479.039 --> 3483.2000000000003
with

3480.319 --> 3486.16
here yeah in

3483.2 --> 3488.9199999999996
bardia gas has to have weight and

3486.16 --> 3491.64
momentum in order for anything to work

3488.92 --> 3494.599
it doesn't no air doesn't have mass

3491.64 --> 3494.5989999999997
what's Mass

3498.96 --> 3502.96
r no it doesn't have

3503.72 --> 3506.72
mass

3507.799 --> 3513.28
what are you diver Dan Navy's vet little

3510.839 --> 3517.44
secret clone or

3513.28 --> 3517.44
something what the [ __ ] is wrong with

3524.2 --> 3531.48
you yeah gas has no Mass that's right

3527.52 --> 3533.72
cuz it's gas doesn't have weight do you

3531.48 --> 3535.64
even know what weight

3533.72 --> 3537.9599999999996
is

3535.64 --> 3540.44
yeah gas does not go down go boom boom

3537.96 --> 3544.48
it does not have mass it does not have

3540.44 --> 3548.2000000000003
weight those factors are not

3544.48 --> 3551.96
relevant within physics to

3548.2 --> 3555.5589999999997
gas yeah what is weighing when you weigh

3551.96 --> 3559.2400000000002
something what do you do you compare

3555.559 --> 3563.6400000000003
relative density dise equilibrium of an

3559.24 --> 3567.16
object with this compared to the

3563.64 --> 3570.8799999999997
gas of the air it is

3567.16 --> 3574.0389999999998
in and then you see if there's a

3570.88 --> 3578.559
disequilibrium and that will cause a

3574.039 --> 3581.3590000000004
pressure yeah air doesn't do that air

3578.559 --> 3581.3590000000004
doesn't press

3588.799 --> 3595.0389999999998
down this is new to you oh yeah it's new

3591.799 --> 3597.52
to you yeah yeah except I I've been

3595.039 --> 3601.2000000000003
talking about it for [ __ ] 10 years

3597.52 --> 3605.52
though I have like multiple shows that

3601.2 --> 3609.9199999999996
literally are titled gas has no Mass

3605.52 --> 3612.799
literally multiple for years I guess

3609.92 --> 3615.839
nobody pays attention to anything I

3612.799 --> 3618.92
do I mean it's even been discussed on

3615.839 --> 3618.92
Flat Earth debates

3619.079 --> 3626.559
itself gas has no

3622.599 --> 3626.559
Mass what is mass

3631.13 --> 3634.329
[Music]

3641.88 --> 3645.839
presses in all Direction including down

3643.799 --> 3648.72
yeah so not mass then yeah that's not

3645.839 --> 3651.43
what mass does

3648.72 --> 3653.52
hey

3651.43 --> 3656.52
[Music]

3653.52 --> 3656.52
wow

3657.76 --> 3664.079
what does weight

3660.079 --> 3668.119
do does weight press in all directions

3664.079 --> 3670.1600000000003
including down no no what is weight no

3668.119 --> 3673.2400000000002
that's down that's exclusively down

3670.16 --> 3675.64
isn't it yeah gas doesn't do that it

3673.24 --> 3677.68
presses in all

3675.64 --> 3681.2799999999997
directions not

3677.68 --> 3682.96
down and especially not more down than

3681.28 --> 3687.1600000000003
the other

3682.96 --> 3690.48
directions it doesn't cause a weight

3687.16 --> 3695.3999999999996
differential why because that weight

3690.48 --> 3697.88
differential would be of air in air yeah

3695.4 --> 3700.1600000000003
there is no disequilibrium with the air

3697.88 --> 3702.319
with the air so it's not going to

3700.16 --> 3704.3999999999996
register any weight the mass will

3702.319 --> 3706.4
effectively be

3704.4 --> 3709.119
zero

3706.4 --> 3712.92
yeah because that's what weight is it's

3709.119 --> 3715.119
air weight you weigh it in the

3712.92 --> 3717.799
air then you comp compare the

3715.119 --> 3721.1600000000003
differential of

3717.799 --> 3723.0389999999998
the the density of the object the

3721.16 --> 3725.5989999999997
density of the medium it is in which is

3723.039 --> 3727.88
the air you can't do that with air it's

3725.599 --> 3732.279
going to be a zero disequilibrium it's

3727.88 --> 3734.799
not going to be a push down it's just

3732.279 --> 3738.359
going to do what gas does and press in

3734.799 --> 3741.279
all directions it'll still do

3738.359 --> 3743.359
that but it's not going to register

3741.279 --> 3746.359
weight it doesn't have

3743.359 --> 3746.359
mass

3751.35 --> 3756.5989999999997
[Music]

3753.359 --> 3759.119
oh yeah oh compressed air what is

3756.599 --> 3759.119
compressed

3760.2 --> 3767.3399999999997
air what happens when you compress

3764.27 --> 3767.34
[Music]

3768.76 --> 3776.2400000000002
air could it be that it turns into a

3773.52 --> 3779.92
liquid

3776.24 --> 3783.52
perhaps yeah hey and if air is

3779.92 --> 3785.76
compressed to a liquid Well w liquids

3783.52 --> 3788.799
definitely have

3785.76 --> 3792.2000000000003
mass yeah they have a weight you will

3788.799 --> 3795.68
register a this equilibrium with the

3792.2 --> 3799.319
much more dense liquid that is

3795.68 --> 3802.72
compressed air compared to the air that

3799.319 --> 3806.72
surrounds it and the tanker yeah it's

3802.72 --> 3809.24
that simple you compress it to become a

3806.72 --> 3811.9599999999996
liquid well there you go you got Mass

3809.24 --> 3814.5589999999997
because now it's a liquid it's state

3811.96 --> 3817.319
dependent if you make it into a liquid

3814.559 --> 3821.2000000000003
it's not a gas anymore and then yeah it

3817.319 --> 3823.799
can have weight can have momentum even

3821.2 --> 3825.9199999999996
yeah but I mean in a liquid state

3823.799 --> 3828.64
momentum yeah the tanker if you keep it

3825.92 --> 3830.279
compressed in the tanker then the liquid

3828.64 --> 3832.839
in the tanker as long as it remains

3830.279 --> 3835.319
compressed will add to the momentum of

3832.839 --> 3837.88
the tanker if you love it off with a

3835.319 --> 3841.68
giant catapult

3837.88 --> 3845.44
yeah but if you try to do that

3841.68 --> 3847.64
liquid without the container to keep it

3845.44 --> 3852.079
compressed it's not going to have a lot

3847.64 --> 3855.0389999999998
of momentum eh it's going to explode and

3852.079 --> 3856.799
then it's a cloud that just hangs there

3855.039 --> 3859.559
it's not going to keep

3856.799 --> 3861.16
moving because it doesn't have momentum

3859.559 --> 3864.039
anymore because it's not a liquid

3861.16 --> 3865.0789999999997
anymore it quickly exploded into gasia

3864.039 --> 3867.92
St

3865.079 --> 3869.92
again and in a gas state it doesn't have

3867.92 --> 3874.16
momentum it doesn't have

3869.92 --> 3877.16
mass yeah it only does that in a

3874.16 --> 3877.16
nonous

3880.119 --> 3887.1600000000003

what

4072.92 --> 4078.319
what

4074.88 --> 4078.319
okay dup that's

4078.559 --> 4083.6800000000003
weird why do you think there's an ice

4080.92 --> 4083.6800000000003
wall to the

4100.56 --> 4106.0
east oh wait no the white is not the

4103.48 --> 4108.959999999999
eyes oh okay right

4106.0 --> 4112.159
yeah I

4108.96 --> 4112.159
mean yeah

4114.759 --> 4120.64
duper that is roughly like a rectangular

4118.0 --> 4123.48
looping model basically what you got in

4120.64 --> 4124.2390000000005
mind it's the roughest sketch that I've

4123.48 --> 4127.718999999999
ever

4124.239 --> 4129.5199999999995
seen I'll actually share it the guys if

4127.719 --> 4132.759
you don't

4129.52 --> 4134.88
mind it's not the yeah I know but it's

4132.759 --> 4136.88
because you left that that part white

4134.88 --> 4142.4800000000005
and I just assumed that the white was

4136.88 --> 4142.4800000000005
the ice wall but the white is not a

4147.31 --> 4152.839000000001
[Music]

4154.04 --> 4159.239
thing so this is what duper wanted to

4156.96 --> 4159.2390000000005
show

4162.719 --> 4165.719
me

4166.719 --> 4172.56
right but I mean yeah that's a rough

4169.64 --> 4174.719
very rough sketch of the of a

4172.56 --> 4177.6
rectangular looping

4174.719 --> 4178.759
system and yeah there might be ice to

4177.6 --> 4180.679
the

4178.759 --> 4184.359
north we don't

4180.679 --> 4184.359
know if it's like a

4184.759 --> 4189.759
wall I don't think there's really like a

4187.279 --> 4192.4400000000005
wall there in the

4189.759 --> 4194.84
north the wall is like on land and

4192.44 --> 4195.759999999999
that's Antarctica

[Music]

4213.67 --> 4216.779
[Music]

4218.04 --> 4222.64
know compare its weight to an empty

4220.92 --> 4225.64
canister which

4222.64 --> 4225.64
will

4229.0 --> 4232.96
yeah sure there might be some this

4230.88 --> 4237.56
equilibrium fight the fat Muppet but

4232.96 --> 4237.56
it's going to be like minute

4239.159 --> 4244.36
insignificant definitely not

4240.92 --> 4246.84
proportional to atomic mass of anything

4244.36 --> 4249.239
right I mean we've gone through I've

4246.84 --> 4250.360000000001
gone through this with George Sanford to

4249.239 --> 4253.48
no

4250.36 --> 4255.799999999999
end like I'm I'm very tired of bringing

4253.48 --> 4258.199
this this subject specifically back up

4255.8 --> 4260.96
it's very tiresome because people just

4258.199 --> 4265.759999999999
won't let it

4260.96 --> 4268.56
go insist [ __ ] air mess go down go

4265.76 --> 4272.4800000000005
boom boom yeah [ __ ] off I'm done with

4268.56 --> 4275.159000000001
that [ __ ] I don't want to argue about it

4272.48 --> 4277.12
Air does not have

4275.159 --> 4281.679
momentum

4277.12 --> 4283.64
and yeah it's just no point yeah I mean

4281.679 --> 4286.92
I could bring up the weird details again

4283.64 --> 4290.400000000001
and of like yeah have you ever weigh a

4286.92 --> 4292.36
gas tank when it's completely open like

4290.4 --> 4294.08
the the nozzle straight open and you

4292.36 --> 4296.639999999999
just have the gas tank you put it on the

4294.08 --> 4300.0
scale it gives a certain readout yeah

4296.64 --> 4303.1990000000005
now what if you drew a

4300.0 --> 4305.199
vacuum in the tank and then close it off

4303.199 --> 4307.199
with the vacuum in the

4305.199 --> 4308.28
inside what what do you think is going

4307.199 --> 4311.199
to

4308.28 --> 4314.08
happen yeah it's going to weigh less

4311.199 --> 4315.239
it's going to make

4314.08 --> 4318.76
the

4315.239 --> 4319.839999999999
weight of the the the tanker right

4318.76 --> 4323.320000000001
that's what you're weighing right is

4319.84 --> 4325.719
going to make it less so did the vacuum

4323.32 --> 4329.5199999999995
take away the

4325.719 --> 4331.84
weight is this minus weight is this

4329.52 --> 4334.84
negative weight that was

4331.84 --> 4334.84
added

4335.52 --> 4342.6
no you just have to realize that weight

4338.84 --> 4344.1990000000005
is like a point of view it's a system

4342.6 --> 4346.639
that's a convention

4344.199 --> 4350.36
what's actually happening

4346.639 --> 4352.32
is the density the objects compared to

4350.36 --> 4356.159
the density with the

4352.32 --> 4358.759999999999
surrounding the disequilibrium between

4356.159 --> 4361.199
the object and the surrounding density

4358.76 --> 4364.320000000001
will cause it relative density dise

4361.199 --> 4367.759999999999
equilibrium force that will push and

4364.32 --> 4371.08
that push is registered on a

4367.76 --> 4375.4400000000005
scale and that's then translated into

4371.08 --> 4375.44
weight the the metrics of weight

4376.0 --> 4380.159
and that's the convention that's the

4377.4 --> 4383.44
convention of weight but there's all

4380.159 --> 4385.839999999999
kinds of weird stuff with it like hey

4383.44 --> 4388.839999999999
what if you draw a vacuum in that object

4385.84 --> 4391.400000000001
oh now it literally weighs

4388.84 --> 4394.56
less so does that mean that you were

4391.4 --> 4398.239
weighing the gas

4394.56 --> 4400.679
alongside it was the gas in it also

4398.239 --> 4403.5199999999995
adding to the official weight of the

4400.679 --> 4406.4800000000005
object no probably not because if you

4403.52 --> 4410.360000000001
literally had have molten it down or

4406.48 --> 4415.678999999999
crunched it into like a a a solid bar

4410.36 --> 4418.88
that tanker yeah it would weigh just as

4415.679 --> 4422.6
much as the open tanker not as much as

4418.88 --> 4426.159000000001
the vacuum drawn tanker you see cuz

4422.6 --> 4430.120000000001
literally effectively the vacuum drawing

4426.159 --> 4435.36
will take away

4430.12 --> 4435.36
weight and that makes no sense

4436.32 --> 4441.199
yeah you can't add negative weight but

4439.4 --> 4443.32
it happens

4441.199 --> 4445.759999999999
anyway all you have to do is draw a

4443.32 --> 4448.48
vacuum and now oh yes weighs

4445.76 --> 4451.2390000000005
less yeah it's not because air has

4448.48 --> 4454.759999999999
weight it's because the entire dise

4451.239 --> 4454.759999999999
equilibrium of the object is

4456.12 --> 4462.8
different has another density now yeah

4459.719 --> 4468.28
vacuum averaged out with an object yeah

4462.8 --> 4468.28
definit decreases the average density

4470.4 --> 4476.04
so so you can have air and try to weigh

4473.32 --> 4478.12
it in air and it will be zero it has

4476.04 --> 4483.08
zero weight zero

4478.12 --> 4485.88
Mass if you put a vacuum in an object

4483.08 --> 4488.44
then it will get Negative weight from

4485.88 --> 4490.76
that vacuum yeah all these things are

4488.44 --> 4494.678999999999
pointing at like hey hey that weight

4490.76 --> 4496.4800000000005
thing that weight what you think

4494.679 --> 4499.36
what you think about it about things

4496.48 --> 4501.759999999999
pressing down yeah you're probably

4499.36 --> 4503.96
thinking through Newtonian type of

4501.76 --> 4507.76
reasoning right about it yeah well guess

4503.96 --> 4510.0
what that's all completely wrong cuz

4507.76 --> 4511.92
that's not what's happening gases don't

4510.0 --> 4515.88
go down go boom

4511.92 --> 4519.1990000000005
boom matter doesn't all have inherent

4515.88 --> 4522.2390000000005
weight especially

4519.199 --> 4524.28
gases right what is going on is that

4522.239 --> 4527.678999999999
there is this

4524.28 --> 4530.92
density thing going on things can have a

4527.679 --> 4532.8
density and that density in relation to

4530.92 --> 4534.639
the density of other things will

4532.8 --> 4537.320000000001
determine what it

4534.639 --> 4539.96
does if it wants to go down or if it

4537.32 --> 4539.96
wants to go

4540.08 --> 4546.28
up and that's a real thing that is

4543.32 --> 4548.679
officially recognized in physics they

4546.28 --> 4553.4
know it is density they know that that

4548.679 --> 4557.52
is real within physics density is used

4553.4 --> 4557.5199999999995
in the mechanics of it because it really

4558.8 --> 4564.159000000001
works yeah not newon in mechanics using

4562.719 --> 4567.0
mass and

4564.159 --> 4569.239
weight now weight is still used as a

4567.0 --> 4572.639
convention but what it really is is

4569.239 --> 4576.48
relative density this equilibrium Force

4572.639 --> 4579.2390000000005
preponderance of an object in the medium

4576.48 --> 4582.12
of air that is what weight effectively

4579.239 --> 4584.04
is okay I'm going to let the cat

4582.12 --> 4587.0
out

4584.04 --> 4587.0
what is it

4587.6 --> 4593.320000000001
oh he's back in front of the

4596.92 --> 4605.679
heater why is my video why the hell is

4600.32 --> 4605.679
my video freaking 10 minutes behind what

4605.93 --> 4610.589
[Music]

4611.639 --> 4616.2390000000005
the no man mass is vacuum

4621.84 --> 4627.639
no no

4624.639 --> 4630.400000000001
negative

4627.639 --> 4634.2390000000005
yeah regular

4630.4 --> 4636.32
air is no Mass

4634.239 --> 4641.5599999999995
vacuum

4636.32 --> 4643.599999999999
minus negative W yeah that's

4641.56 --> 4646.2390000000005
real it's called

4643.6 --> 4648.92
negative it's a NE it goes in the minus

4646.239 --> 4650.919999999999
an object that you would put on a scale

4648.92 --> 4652.679
has a certain weight that is consistent

4650.92 --> 4654.92
if you then draw a

4652.679 --> 4658.1990000000005
vacuum in the object if it has a

4654.92 --> 4663.4
container within it or is it a container

4658.199 --> 4663.4
yeah it will go into the

4663.48 --> 4666.48
negative

4667.679 --> 4673.84
yeah air is not antimatter yeah I know

4670.679 --> 4677.36
it isn't I'm just I'm pointing out

4673.84 --> 4679.679
like how this way of thinking about it

4677.36 --> 4679.679
is

4681.719 --> 4688.4800000000005
wrong weight is a

4684.679 --> 4692.159
convention it's not physics it's not

4688.48 --> 4694.44
like absolute matter inherent it's a

4692.159 --> 4698.32
convention

4694.44 --> 4702.0
system relative density this equilibrium

4698.32 --> 4704.5199999999995
pressure preponderance in the medium of

4702.0 --> 4708.199
air

4704.52 --> 4711.0
now if you want to weigh something not

4708.199 --> 4713.638999999999
with regular weight but in water well

4711.0 --> 4716.199
then you get water weight which is

4713.639 --> 4718.96
different yeah it will have a different

4716.199 --> 4721.239
density thise equilibrium because the

4718.96 --> 4725.639
medium is much more

4721.239 --> 4728.28
dense so lower density objects might

4725.639 --> 4731.32
have no

4728.28 --> 4733.96
weight or have even have negative weight

4731.32 --> 4737.5199999999995
they'll go up

4733.96 --> 4738.92
yeah it's still water weight and I have

4737.52 --> 4742.2390000000005
you vacuum

4738.92 --> 4744.4400000000005
weight vacuum weight is also different

4742.239 --> 4747.839999999999
because things that have a certain

4744.44 --> 4750.36
weight in the air they're likely to

4747.84 --> 4750.360000000001
weigh

4750.8 --> 4757.04
more in a

4753.28 --> 4759.4
vacuum why because the object's density

4757.04 --> 4761.84
is going to be

4759.4 --> 4764.679
higher than the

4761.84 --> 4768.08
vacuum it's going to be farther apart

4764.679 --> 4771.8
the density compared to that object in

4768.08 --> 4771.8
relation to regular air

4772.44 --> 4775.44
density

4776.56 --> 4783.2390000000005
see it's not a mathematical description

4779.92 --> 4783.2390000000005
duper it's a

4783.639 --> 4788.719
convention it's not a mathematical you

4786.4 --> 4791.12
got that exactly wrong it's specifically

4788.719 --> 4791.12
not

4791.84 --> 4795.56
that

4793.25 --> 4798.84
[Music]

4795.56 --> 4798.84
it's a conventional

4804.88 --> 4809.679
system never gets to zero

4815.84 --> 4821.76
what to

4819.04 --> 4824.76
Z

4821.76 --> 4824.76
what

4829.639 --> 4834.56
yeah okay fine there's no absolute

4832.56 --> 4836.84
vacuum but I

4834.56 --> 4840.280000000001
mean

4836.84 --> 4842.4800000000005
you the average density of even like a

4840.28 --> 4846.719
vacuum that we can

4842.48 --> 4850.159
create is going to be

4846.719 --> 4851.719
insignificant the density disequilibrium

4850.159 --> 4856.199
will be

4851.719 --> 4856.199
maximized it won't be

4856.32 --> 4861.799999999999
absolute

4858.92 --> 4865.32
right because you can't get an absolute

4861.8 --> 4867.320000000001
vacuum but I mean it's going to be as

4865.32 --> 4869.92
the dise equilibrium is going to be

4867.32 --> 4873.96
effectively maximized at a certain

4869.92 --> 4873.96
point anything in a

4874.6 --> 4878.120000000001
vacuum right I

4881.0 --> 4885.239
mean a chunk of

4885.4 --> 4893.599999999999
lead is going to be just as much

4888.639 --> 4896.2390000000005
maximized with a vacuum in its density

4893.6 --> 4898.400000000001
dise equilibrium

4896.239 --> 4903.28
as

4898.4 --> 4903.28
uh I don't know a rubber

4903.719 --> 4909.08
ball it's just going to be a maximum

4906.76 --> 4910.1990000000005
relative density disequilibrium so it's

4909.08 --> 4913.28
both going to

4910.199 --> 4918.159
fall just as hard

4913.28 --> 4918.159
just as fast no no friction to stop

4918.92 --> 4926.12
it right but of course like

4922.44 --> 4930.879999999999
the yeah the paper ball or whatever is

4926.12 --> 4934.239
not going to have a weight registry as

4930.88 --> 4934.2390000000005
much as the

4936.44 --> 4944.08
other cuz that's a separate thing I mean

4939.239 --> 4946.638999999999
the total object still will press

4944.08 --> 4950.159
but the the disequilibrium is like

4946.639 --> 4950.159000000001
equally maximized in the

4950.32 --> 4954.599999999999
vacuum because like you can't have a

4953.04 --> 4959.04
higher differential between the

4954.6 --> 4959.04
densities than weighing something in a

4971.56 --> 4974.56
vacuum

4988.84 --> 4995.32
what is

4991.84 --> 4999.0
it I thought that was just called

4995.32 --> 4999.0
halflife Fight The Fat

5018.4 --> 5022.12
healthy sounds very

5023.89 --> 5026.979
[Music]

5031.48 --> 5034.48
dangerous

5051.38 --> 5054.579
[Music]

5061.36 --> 5064.36
okay

5070.239 --> 5079.199
wait is is

5073.12 --> 5079.199
waight math or not it's a convention

5085.4 --> 5090.0
duper

5087.0 --> 5093.04
Newtonian mechanics

5090.0 --> 5095.199
weight is math based

5093.04 --> 5098.199
and the

5095.199 --> 5101.719
buned but the weight that we use that we

5098.199 --> 5104.4
put on the scale that's a

5101.719 --> 5106.6
convention that is based on the relative

5104.4 --> 5109.799999999999
density disequilibrium pressure of an

5106.6 --> 5109.8
object that you put on the

5115.4 --> 5120.839999999999
scale in air that's spe like that is

5118.719 --> 5122.4800000000005
what we do with weight it's how much dis

5120.84 --> 5124.0
equilibrium in air because yeah you

5122.48 --> 5126.08
could put something in the skill in the

5124.0 --> 5127.36
water it's going to register very

5126.08 --> 5128.76
different you can put something in the

5127.36 --> 5130.119
skill in the vacuum it's going to

5128.76 --> 5133.92
register

5130.119 --> 5137.4
different that's why weight is anchored

5133.92 --> 5143.4400000000005
down in air at ground level that type of

5137.4 --> 5143.44
pressure as to set a universal

5148.28 --> 5154.28
standard what is

5150.159 --> 5154.28
it KY

5156.88 --> 5162.8
relative density is specific gravity

5159.76 --> 5166.88
yeah sure that is that is how it is

5162.8 --> 5170.119000000001
registered they call it specific

5166.88 --> 5170.119
gravity these

5175.11 --> 5178.32
[Music]

5178.44 --> 5183.638999999999
days oh and specific gravity has nothing

5181.719 --> 5186.6
to do with gravity and is very well

5183.639 --> 5186.6
recognized in

5187.54 --> 5191.48
[Music]

5189.04 --> 5193.159
physics and they just had to put gravity

5191.48 --> 5195.199
in there of course because it has

5193.159 --> 5196.92
absolutely nothing to do with gravity so

5195.199 --> 5199.719
they have to call it gravity because

5196.92 --> 5203.0
they can't just admit that gravity

5199.719 --> 5205.96
doesn't exist right can't just make

5203.0 --> 5207.36
people stop searching to figure out what

5205.96 --> 5210.96
gravity

5207.36 --> 5213.0
is right the Eternal search for

5210.96 --> 5215.119
Gravity I mean I mean that should be

5213.0 --> 5218.0
like the Star Trek

5215.119 --> 5220.28
motto the search for Gravity like what

5218.0 --> 5222.36
is it it has to be there because

5220.28 --> 5224.36
otherwise nothing we believe makes any

5222.36 --> 5229.679
sense but we don't know what it is but

5224.36 --> 5229.679
we'll find out one day yeah that's

5236.36 --> 5239.938999999999

5241.119 --> 5244.119
gravity

5249.69 --> 5252.839999999999
[Music]

5271.119 --> 5274.119
what

5283.67 --> 5286.85
[Music]

5287.56 --> 5292.119000000001
okay Thor casy interesting though I

5290.119 --> 5294.839999999999
don't know about this radon stuff though

5292.119 --> 5300.159
it sounds kind of

5294.84 --> 5303.8
risky but does doesn't the radon gas

5300.159 --> 5307.08
basically evaporate into the regular

5303.8 --> 5308.679
air or does it like not do that does it

5307.08 --> 5311.32
stay separate

5308.679 --> 5313.84
because if that's the case then that's

5311.32 --> 5316.159
kind of freaky I didn't know like that's

5313.84 --> 5318.719
the first gas I've ever heard of that

5316.159 --> 5323.5599999999995
actually doesn't

5318.719 --> 5326.92
just mix in with the inhomogeneous

5323.56 --> 5326.92
mesh of the

5331.0 --> 5334.0
air

5334.6 --> 5340.159000000001
so I that kind of weird to say like

5337.679 --> 5344.28
there's still raid on just like sitting

5340.159 --> 5344.28
in a puddle in my basement like

5351.4 --> 5358.5199999999995
what like that shouldn't be lingering

5354.44 --> 5360.919999999999
any type of gas should be

5358.52 --> 5364.119000000001
dispersed after a certain period of time

5360.92 --> 5367.56
and unless there is a continual influx

5364.119 --> 5369.199
of that gas from a source like it's

5367.56 --> 5371.56
coming out of the ground out of a big

5369.199 --> 5374.5199999999995
pocket or whatever and then it keeps

5371.56 --> 5375.679
coming then it will stay pure where it

5374.52 --> 5379.2390000000005
keeps coming

5375.679 --> 5381.36
out but if you just leave gas whether

5379.239 --> 5384.638999999999
it's like high density or low density or

5381.36 --> 5387.119
whatever it's going to quickly disperse

5384.639 --> 5391.4800000000005
and just mix

5387.119 --> 5394.32
in it doesn't like linger around every

5391.48 --> 5396.4
type of gas typically dissolves it it

5394.32 --> 5398.36
evaporates and then mixes in with the

5396.4 --> 5401.199
inhomogeneous

5398.36 --> 5403.4
mesh right like sulfur AEL fluide in the

5401.199 --> 5406.239
container it's there for a

5403.4 --> 5408.32
bit in an aquarium and you can float a

5408.32 --> 5411.759999999999

5415.32 --> 5420.96
10 minutes at best before it's just gone

5418.84 --> 5423.28
and the boat just falls down because

5420.96 --> 5426.28
it's not floating in there anymore it's

5423.28 --> 5426.28
all

5432.719 --> 5435.719

[Music]

5450.84 --> 5453.84
what

5462.199 --> 5468.5199999999995
gas gas M what no

5465.48 --> 5470.759999999999
duper Nathan definitely does not say gas

5468.52 --> 5470.76
has

5480.76 --> 5483.76
mass

5489.679 --> 5496.1990000000005
in a sealed room what will

5493.92 --> 5500.08
happen

5496.199 --> 5503.36
no if you put it in a sealed container

5500.08 --> 5506.04
then it will stay in there if you put it

5503.36 --> 5509.119
in a room that's consistent of gas then

5506.04 --> 5512.8
it will disperse within the available

5509.119 --> 5515.839999999999
gas it's going to mix in

5512.8 --> 5515.84
the weird thing to

5518.48 --> 5524.119
say in a tank in a sealed room yeah it's

5522.199 --> 5527.719
going to dissolve it's going to

5524.119 --> 5530.92
evaporate in that room it's not going to

5527.719 --> 5533.119
stay there sealed it doesn't matter if

5530.92 --> 5535.679
it's a sealed room unless the container

5533.119 --> 5539.159
itself is

5535.679 --> 5542.28
sealed if you have regular gas whether

5539.159 --> 5545.759999999999
that's all locked off it's going to

5542.28 --> 5545.759999999999
evaporate in the regular

5546.88 --> 5553.4400000000005
gas if you if there's no barrier in

5549.84 --> 5558.03
between that's what gases do they

5553.44 --> 5559.839999999999
eventually start to evaporate in one

5558.03 --> 5562.199
[Music]

5559.84 --> 5564.719
another so will it

5562.199 --> 5568.5599999999995
disappear yeah it will no longer be

5564.719 --> 5570.639
separate layers it's going to evaporate

5568.56 --> 5572.360000000001
in the air of the

5570.639 --> 5575.92
room

5572.36 --> 5575.92
even though that room is closed

5581.84 --> 5589.0
off disappear no it's

5585.44 --> 5594.44
evaporated it's mixed in into the

5589.0 --> 5594.44
inhomogeneous mesh of the air of the

5600.56 --> 5605.84
room evaporates dissolves I don't know

5603.92 --> 5610.32
what the hell kind of word you need for

5605.84 --> 5613.84
that just it mixes in it becomes an

5610.32 --> 5616.88
inhomogeneous mesh yeah air doesn't form

5613.84 --> 5620.4800000000005
layers gases don't form

5616.88 --> 5623.84
layers they they can if they like in a

5620.48 --> 5625.759999999999
pure form are inserted somewhere then

5623.84 --> 5628.56
they have temporary

5625.76 --> 5633.119000000001
separation temporary you know why

5628.56 --> 5635.88
because gas moves in all dire

5633.119 --> 5638.92
directions it's going to be separated

5635.88 --> 5642.96
for a little bit and

5638.92 --> 5645.4800000000005
then oh there it goes goes in all

5642.96 --> 5647.199
directions oh the separated layer that

5645.48 --> 5650.799999999999
might have floated something oh yeah

5647.199 --> 5653.08
it's going away poof cuz it's all mixed

5650.8 --> 5660.259
in doesn't take that

5653.08 --> 5660.259
[Music]

5660.48 --> 5665.32
long

5662.05 --> 5667.84
[Music]

5665.32 --> 5670.08
given enough time yeah and enough time

5667.84 --> 5672.96
is like a few

5670.08 --> 5673.84
minutes yeah it's not an eternity it's

5672.96 --> 5678.609
very

5673.84 --> 5678.609
[Music]

5690.48 --> 5693.48
quick

5707.56 --> 5712.360000000001
right yes T Casey I mean it's a it's an

5710.0 --> 5715.0
interesting system to figure out air

5712.36 --> 5717.639
tightness with the radon and everything

5715.0 --> 5721.52
but I mean you do realize Tor casc right

5717.639 --> 5724.76
that the radon doesn't linger yeah when

5721.52 --> 5727.679
they use it it's there that shouldn't be

5724.76 --> 5730.719
lasting the rest of your days like it's

5727.679 --> 5735.119
not oh there's some pockets of Ron still

5730.719 --> 5740.56
hanging around here that shouldn't be

5735.119 --> 5744.5599999999995
happening cuz it disperses over

5740.56 --> 5746.6
time it evaporates dissolves disperses

5744.56 --> 5749.639
is it this just disperse the word I'm

5746.6 --> 5749.639
not I'm never really

5750.4 --> 5755.119
sure

5753.199 --> 5758.36
disperse is the word that Nathan

5755.119 --> 5761.5599999999995
typically uses in QE so that's probably

5758.36 --> 5763.5199999999995
the right word mixing in with the other

5761.56 --> 5767.4400000000005
gases

5763.52 --> 5767.4400000000005
disperses right that's what

5768.36 --> 5774.199
happens it absolutely lingers that's the

5775.719 --> 5780.8
problem

5778.159 --> 5782.719
okay what's your evidence how long does

5780.8 --> 5785.04
that linger

5782.719 --> 5786.639
like I don't even know what you're

5785.04 --> 5789.679
talking about at this

5786.639 --> 5792.28
point like maybe if there's like really

5789.679 --> 5797.719
isolated pockets or something there's

5792.28 --> 5797.719
some some Hollow

5798.32 --> 5805.28
bubble somewhere that it filled in and

5802.04 --> 5807.0
then like it just doesn't really get out

5805.28 --> 5809.84
of there there's

5807.0 --> 5812.0
no it's like a very remote place

5809.84 --> 5814.1990000000005
somewhere inside might be like yeah

5812.0 --> 5816.48
might maybe it'll just stick in there

5814.199 --> 5821.239
for some reason but technically like all

5816.48 --> 5821.239
gases should eventually

5821.28 --> 5825.5599999999995
disperse shouldn't be taking that

5840.199 --> 5843.199
long

5845.4 --> 5848.96
otherwise yeah what you're basically

5847.0 --> 5851.719
saying is that you can just keep raid on

5848.96 --> 5854.96
in an open container and it won't go

5851.719 --> 5857.4
anywhere that's really bizarre like

5854.96 --> 5859.639
that's a claim that's a claim I'd like

5857.4 --> 5859.638999999999
to

5870.199 --> 5873.199
study

5877.04 --> 5884.04
right but be because it should

5879.36 --> 5887.0
disperse into the rest of the air it's

5884.04 --> 5889.159
like it's like cute that it's sitting

5887.0 --> 5891.52
there very low point but I mean there's

5889.159 --> 5894.36
going to be other air there that other

5891.52 --> 5897.119000000001
air is going to gradually over time mix

5894.36 --> 5899.119
in with the radon and then it's not

5897.119 --> 5903.159
going to have that density anymore and

5899.119 --> 5908.199
then it's just going to get out of

5903.159 --> 5908.199
there it's too heavy that's very

5908.32 --> 5911.679
cute it's

5912.56 --> 5918.280000000001
gas it's going to disperse doesn't

5915.8 --> 5920.88
matter how heavy it is even if it was

5918.28 --> 5924.0
effectively as heavy as lead as like

5920.88 --> 5926.56
solid lead if a gas was as as heavy as

5924.0 --> 5929.239
solid lead like

5926.56 --> 5930.96
what like it's still gas it's still

5929.239 --> 5932.839999999999
going to disperse it's just going to

5930.96 --> 5936.04
like like

5932.84 --> 5938.52
poof go into the other gases go with it

5936.04 --> 5943.0
doesn't really require force it like

5938.52 --> 5943.0
just requires time

5943.27 --> 5952.599
[Music]

5948.639 --> 5954.84
entropy not dispersing yeah exactly

5952.599 --> 5957.400000000001
Richard G like this is

5954.84 --> 5959.360000000001
not this is some groundbreaking stuff

5957.4 --> 5963.199
here it's the claims of

5959.36 --> 5965.598999999999
uh second law thermodynamics violation

5963.199 --> 5967.839999999999
like to see that actually being tested

5965.599 --> 5967.84
and

5972.159 --> 5978.08
backed I'm pretty sure there have been

5975.08 --> 5980.36
like dispersion tests too with gases

5978.08 --> 5984.44
with all the gases like how long does it

5980.36 --> 5987.759999999999
take for this amount like a cubic meter

5984.44 --> 5991.08
of a very specific gas with the surface

5987.76 --> 5994.04
left over open to the regular air in

5991.08 --> 5996.639
room or whatever and then how detection

5994.04 --> 5999.639
how long until it has been completely

5996.639 --> 6003.1990000000005
dispersed dispersion tests on every type

5999.639 --> 6005.96
of gas and obviously like the very low

6003.199 --> 6008.44
density gases like helium and hydrogen

6005.96 --> 6010.4
would like disperse very quickly and the

6008.44 --> 6013.119
higher density the gas

6010.4 --> 6014.679
becomes probably the more time it takes

6013.119 --> 6018.44
to

6014.679 --> 6019.96
disperse there should be logically a

6018.44 --> 6022.719
linear

6019.96 --> 6027.32
relation

6022.719 --> 6029.4800000000005
between density and gas dispersion time

6027.32 --> 6031.5599999999995
like in my mind that's a logical linear

6029.48 --> 6034.159
relationship I don't know if that's

6031.56 --> 6036.400000000001
actually what how it is but that seems

6034.159 --> 6041.119
logical to

6036.4 --> 6044.92
me but there can be logically a gas

6041.119 --> 6048.598999999999
which will literally never disperse like

6044.92 --> 6051.8
every gas should

6048.599 --> 6054.04
disperse otherwise it's like oh yeah we

6051.8 --> 6057.599
got like this entirety of physics and

6054.04 --> 6059.599
chemistry and all of that we know that

6057.599 --> 6061.92
there's just this one gas though that

6059.599 --> 6064.400000000001
just it just won't disperse it we don't

6061.92 --> 6064.4
know

6065.119 --> 6070.199
why yeah never heard of it if there was

6068.199 --> 6072.839999999999
a freaky exception like that I would

6070.199 --> 6072.839999999999
have heard of

6072.89 --> 6078.0
[Music]

6074.719 --> 6081.56
it so I don't know about your radon

6078.0 --> 6084.119
situation Thor KC

6081.56 --> 6084.119000000001
but

6087.599 --> 6094.400000000001
uh logically yeah every type of gas

6091.92 --> 6097.84
should eventually disperse no matter how

6094.4 --> 6103.799999999999
dense it is unless it just has no way to

6097.84 --> 6103.8
get away and get in contact with regular

6104.52 --> 6110.52
gas like comparable if you'd had a

6107.4 --> 6112.92
tanker filled up with radon and like

6110.52 --> 6115.280000000001
with an an opening with a tube and then

6112.92 --> 6117.96
you have that tanker like buried down in

6115.28 --> 6120.36
your basement with a tube still

6117.96 --> 6124.199
connected but it's like 3 or four met

6120.36 --> 6126.839999999999
deep something crazy remote yeah well if

6124.199 --> 6130.48
you have it like that well then I'd say

6126.84 --> 6134.599
there is a chance that if you like go

6130.48 --> 6137.119
there like in 10 years you bury up the

6134.599 --> 6138.56
tanker that it's still mostly filled

6137.119 --> 6142.44
with

6138.56 --> 6144.8
radon because it has a lot of trouble

6142.44 --> 6147.32
actually connecting up with the regular

6144.8 --> 6147.320000000001
Mash of

6147.36 --> 6150.36
air

6150.4 --> 6156.48
right but maybe even there I'm wrong

6153.159 --> 6160.159
maybe it it it won't last 10 years at

6156.48 --> 6162.28
all I therefore like dispersion time how

6160.159 --> 6165.719
long does it take for a certain type of

6162.28 --> 6168.159
gas with a certain type of density to

6165.719 --> 6171.119
disperse how are the mechanics of that I

6168.159 --> 6175.719
don't know the details would be very

6171.119 --> 6175.719
interesting to to see some graphs about

6175.79 --> 6178.97
[Music]

6199.679 --> 6202.679
that

6215.92 --> 6219.28
you might want to see your

6220.42 --> 6223.619
[Music]

6227.199 --> 6234.839999999999
basement yeah and then perhaps like make

6231.04 --> 6238.76
sure to suck all that rayon out of

6234.84 --> 6238.76
there once you know it's

6249.76 --> 6256.04
sealed r f

6253.04 --> 6256.04
What

6259.599 --> 6262.599
mo

6264.199 --> 6269.32
right

6265.719 --> 6272.52
anyhow the point remains is that gas

6269.32 --> 6276.28
technically doesn't have a

6272.52 --> 6276.280000000001
mass it doesn't have

6278.119 --> 6284.96
weight and it

6280.599 --> 6284.96
disperses in the

6289.56 --> 6292.56
air

6319.119 --> 6323.36
right I hope you're all enjoying the

6320.56 --> 6327.04
show it's been an interesting

6323.36 --> 6327.04
discussion I think so at

6328.0 --> 6333.28
least just getting kind of tired of

6331.04 --> 6337.28
refreshing my own YouTube

6333.28 --> 6340.4
page because it it like freezes after 5

6337.28 --> 6340.4
Seconds every damn

6349.48 --> 6352.48
time

6367.4 --> 6372.92
why is gas sold in

6369.92 --> 6376.0
kilogram because it's

6372.92 --> 6379.76
compressed it's not gas anymore you

6376.0 --> 6383.08
compress gas in a tanker it becomes

6379.76 --> 6385.1990000000005
something else it becomes this weird

6383.08 --> 6387.679
compressed super fluid in some case it

6385.199 --> 6391.678999999999
becomes solid crystals or but mostly it

6387.679 --> 6395.04
just turns into a liquid that liquid

6391.679 --> 6397.92
actually does have

6395.04 --> 6400.679
weight so you compress gas enough and it

6397.92 --> 6404.599
will gain weight by not being gas

6400.679 --> 6409.28
anymore and that's why they sell

6404.599 --> 6409.28
gas in containers in

6409.4 --> 6413.5199999999995
kilograms

6411.639 --> 6416.0
because when you compress it enough it's

6413.52 --> 6419.080000000001
no longer gas and then it attains the

6416.0 --> 6421.36
weight so they sell ironically the gas

6419.08 --> 6421.36
per

6421.639 --> 6426.599
kilograms because when it's stored and

6424.32 --> 6430.199
compressed and not really gas yeah it

6426.599 --> 6432.92
does have a weight but it's they don't

6430.199 --> 6434.879999999999
tell you like how much volume of gas are

6432.92 --> 6437.88
you going to get out of this though they

6434.88 --> 6442.0
could do that it's just that they just

6437.88 --> 6445.3
take the kilograms because it's easier

6442.0 --> 6445.3
[Music]

6446.48 --> 6452.48
right but you can look up like hey I I

6449.52 --> 6455.0
need this amount of volume covered by

6452.48 --> 6456.879999999999
this gas or something in some process

6455.0 --> 6460.76
chemical process or

6456.88 --> 6464.679
whatever how much kilogram of compressed

6460.76 --> 6466.84
gas in a tank do I need to cover this

6464.679 --> 6471.4
amount of volume of

6466.84 --> 6473.639
gas and there are like rough

6471.4 --> 6475.879999999999
calculations for

6473.639 --> 6478.0
that

6475.88 --> 6480.76
right but I

6478.0 --> 6482.599
mean the air or the gases that you're

6480.76 --> 6484.1990000000005
going to buy in expanded State they

6482.599 --> 6486.8
don't have

6484.199 --> 6490.239
weight you can't put them on a scale

6486.8 --> 6491.76
when they're decompressed yeah you can

6490.239 --> 6493.959999999999
only put them on a scale when they're

6491.76 --> 6495.88
compressed and when they're basically no

6493.96 --> 6498.8
longer

6495.88 --> 6502.2390000000005
gas but something else like a liquid and

6498.8 --> 6502.2390000000005
then yeah it gets a weight

6515.28 --> 6520.5599999999995
Raad undiscovered by prodct of uranium

6518.239 --> 6520.5599999999995
oh

6529.199 --> 6533.32
okay

6531.159 --> 6536.32
I don't exactly know about

6533.32 --> 6539.0
radon I know about radium though that's

6536.32 --> 6542.2
a like a metal that's extremely

6539.0 --> 6543.44
radioactive way worse than

6542.2 --> 6545.08
[Music]

6543.44 --> 6549.32
uranium

6545.08 --> 6549.32
radium they used to use that

6549.36 --> 6553.598999999999
for

6551.04 --> 6556.76
watch uh what do you call

6553.599 --> 6558.8
that on a mechanical watch like the

6556.76 --> 6560.88
fingers things what do you call it I

6558.8 --> 6563.360000000001
don't remember the word for that

6560.88 --> 6565.2390000000005
but and then they put little raidon

6563.36 --> 6567.44
covering so that it would light up in

6565.239 --> 6567.44
the

6570.84 --> 6576.4800000000005
dark like even when I was still wearing

6573.96 --> 6578.76
watches like my watch had like a Ron

6576.48 --> 6581.5199999999995
pointer on it pretty

6578.76 --> 6585.280000000001
bizarre that's like super radioactive

6581.52 --> 6585.280000000001
apparently like really

6589.119 --> 6594.598999999999
heavy one million times more yeah

6592.0 --> 6597.36
exactly and they use that in

6594.599 --> 6601.56
regular products that you could just

6597.36 --> 6601.5599999999995
buy and that's not even that long

6604.199 --> 6609.678999999999
ago like the whole thing all of it is

6608.44 --> 6612.4
just

6609.679 --> 6615.76
crazy how they deal with radioactivity

6612.4 --> 6621.598999999999
and the claims about it it's like all so

6615.76 --> 6623.400000000001
crazy and like cognitive dissonant

6621.599 --> 6625.32
how always dealt with

6623.4 --> 6627.239
radioactivity like oh you're going to

6625.32 --> 6629.32
put on the suit for this oh something

6627.239 --> 6631.799999999999
might have happened and but like yeah

6629.32 --> 6634.04
but we still sell like way more

6631.8 --> 6636.52
radioactive stuff on things you just

6634.04 --> 6638.32
regularly take with you yeah you just

6636.52 --> 6640.599
put them on your watch like on your you

6638.32 --> 6642.679
just go everywhere with like but we have

6640.599 --> 6646.2390000000005
to put on the suits because oh there's

6642.679 --> 6650.4800000000005
some less radioactive material that is

6646.239 --> 6653.879999999999
claimed to be in the open there oh none

6650.48 --> 6653.879999999999
of it makes any damn

6668.239 --> 6675.839999999999
sense do molecules have

6672.28 --> 6679.639
mass that's a funny one isn't it yeah

6675.84 --> 6682.2390000000005
well molecules only have mass if they're

6679.639 --> 6685.04
not in a gaseous

6682.239 --> 6688.879999999999
State yeah because

6685.04 --> 6692.48
molecule a molecule is basically a

6688.88 --> 6696.400000000001
concept the state in which the

6692.48 --> 6699.119
theoretical molecule or atom is in is

6696.4 --> 6702.199
much more relevant for its manifestation

6699.119 --> 6705.4
and what it is and what it does and its

6702.199 --> 6708.839999999999
attributes you see but in our mind

6705.4 --> 6711.36
through the atomic thinking it's like oh

6708.84 --> 6713.719
the molecule o the proton and the

6711.36 --> 6715.679
neutron and electrons around it and

6713.719 --> 6718.4
connect it up and they're like yeah

6715.679 --> 6721.4800000000005
they're like that in a gaseous state in

6718.4 --> 6724.679
a solid state in a liquid state but in

6721.48 --> 6727.959999999999
reality those different states make that

6724.679 --> 6730.88
same molecule effectively something

6727.96 --> 6733.079
completely different it becomes

6730.88 --> 6737.36
something different I mean it has the

6733.079 --> 6740.5599999999995
same structure to it internal

6737.36 --> 6744.28
structure but what it effectively

6740.56 --> 6748.079000000001
does in the world becomes

6744.28 --> 6751.599
different there's just a huge different

6748.079 --> 6755.32
in material when it comes from one state

6751.599 --> 6759.679
to the other it becomes something really

6755.32 --> 6761.5599999999995
different the abilities it has becomes

6759.679 --> 6764.88
different the

6761.56 --> 6767.56
physics become different yeah the

6764.88 --> 6769.88
physics of a gas are different as the

6767.56 --> 6772.320000000001
physics of a liquid and the physics of a

6769.88 --> 6775.4400000000005
liquid are different the physics of a

6772.32 --> 6778.84
solid they have different attributes

6775.44 --> 6780.0
even though it's supposedly the same

6778.84 --> 6783.400000000001
atomic

6780.0 --> 6785.52
structure but it's completely different

6783.4 --> 6789.839999999999
because it's a different state and the

6785.52 --> 6793.4400000000005
state really matters it's very very

6789.84 --> 6798.76
important what the state of the atom or

6793.44 --> 6800.638999999999
molecule is in order to establish its

6798.76 --> 6802.400000000001
attributes

6800.639 --> 6804.96
yeah

6802.4 --> 6808.92
the atomic

6804.96 --> 6809.88
structure is kind of like a distraction

6808.92 --> 6812.84
to

6809.88 --> 6814.56
that so you can think like oh but the

6812.84 --> 6818.04
gas and the solid and the liquid they're

6814.56 --> 6822.8
all the same molecule the same atom yeah

6818.04 --> 6825.199
that's that's theoretically correct like

6822.8 --> 6827.96
technically it is correct

6825.199 --> 6832.119
but they're not the same

6827.96 --> 6835.079
though they aren't they just not the

6832.119 --> 6836.799999999999
same same material in a gaseous state is

6835.079 --> 6838.4
like completely different as the same

6836.8 --> 6840.76
material in a solid state it's just

6838.4 --> 6843.4
different it's not the same thing it

6840.76 --> 6845.96
might have the same internal structure

6843.4 --> 6847.4
somehow one could be transformed into

6845.96 --> 6851.92
the

6847.4 --> 6855.199
other but while they are not the same

6851.92 --> 6855.1990000000005
state they are

6858.04 --> 6861.679
different okay

6863.04 --> 6869.48
man today's

6864.96 --> 6869.4800000000005
really an intense physics

6870.21 --> 6873.47
[Music]

6874.199 --> 6879.0
class that's good to go through this

6876.599 --> 6879.0
type of

6888.679 --> 6891.679
subject

6952.44 --> 6956.879999999999
crap you did you're

6954.28 --> 6960.36
right yeah I wanted to say hello seeking

6956.88 --> 6963.0
star water it's interesting what you say

6960.36 --> 6965.5599999999995
around the particle

6963.0 --> 6967.76
molecules perpetual energy machines we

6965.56 --> 6970.76
see it in the model

6967.76 --> 6972.639
of little balls and the other balls and

6970.76 --> 6973.599
we just think that that is what it is

6972.639 --> 6976.32
but

6973.599 --> 6978.079
it's effectively completely different in

6976.32 --> 6980.199
the different

6978.079 --> 6982.079
states right that's what I'm trying to

6980.199 --> 6983.5599999999995
emphasize you could call it energy

6982.079 --> 6986.36
machines

6983.56 --> 6989.52
perhaps but the point is is that just

6986.36 --> 6992.5599999999995
because it's the same structure doesn't

6989.52 --> 6995.76
mean it even has the same

6992.56 --> 7000.599
properties if it's in a different state

6995.76 --> 7004.639
like the state of the matter is

7000.599 --> 7008.4800000000005
everything is a massive

7004.639 --> 7010.4400000000005
implication and a massive

7008.48 --> 7012.0
difference

7010.44 --> 7016.4
like if you're asking what type of

7012.0 --> 7016.4
material you should be asking in what

7017.8 --> 7024.04
state because like that is a like if you

7021.28 --> 7026.639
say like oh what type of material oh

7024.04 --> 7028.679
helium well you're going to kind of per

7026.639 --> 7031.84
default assume oh so that means gas

7028.679 --> 7034.36
helium right because in nature helium

7031.84 --> 7036.88
will typically be the g a

7034.36 --> 7038.119
gas so you're just going to assume oh so

7036.88 --> 7041.28
the gas

7038.119 --> 7043.28
helium but no no no liquid helium oh so

7041.28 --> 7046.32
compressed then in a

7043.28 --> 7050.28
tank right because that's how it would

7046.32 --> 7053.0
have to be if you want helium to be

7050.28 --> 7054.0
liquid cuz in a natural state it would

7053.0 --> 7057.32
be

7054.0 --> 7060.32
gas right but liquid helium is

7057.32 --> 7062.88
completely different acting as a

7060.32 --> 7066.5199999999995
material as gaseous

7062.88 --> 7066.52
helium because it's a

7068.4 --> 7074.598999999999
liquid Mass cannot be created or

7071.599 --> 7074.599
destroyed

7075.32 --> 7082.759999999999
what uh no that's not the saying it's

7080.04 --> 7085.639
matter cannot be created or destroyed

7082.76 --> 7089.679
Mass no no no that's

7085.639 --> 7089.679
not that's not what that

7094.29 --> 7097.489
[Music]

7098.32 --> 7101.719
is

7100.0 --> 7103.56
what is the difference between momentum

7101.719 --> 7106.639
and

7103.56 --> 7108.8
force uh

7106.639 --> 7110.32
well

7108.8 --> 7115.2390000000005
Force

7110.32 --> 7117.32
creates or is acceleration is

7115.239 --> 7119.0
pressure well

7117.32 --> 7123.679
momentum

7119.0 --> 7126.199
is the respons ability responsibility

7123.679 --> 7130.04
but the response

7126.199 --> 7132.119
ability to force so momentum is

7130.04 --> 7134.56
susceptibility as I would call it the

7132.119 --> 7137.598999999999
susceptibility to

7134.56 --> 7139.119000000001
force and to to

7137.599 --> 7140.96
be

7139.119 --> 7144.119
continuing that

7140.96 --> 7148.36
Force so you throw a rock as soon as you

7144.119 --> 7151.0
let it go it will retain the momentum

7148.36 --> 7153.96
that you give it so that force that you

7151.0 --> 7157.199
initially gave to it it will stay with

7153.96 --> 7161.04
it it will continue the pathway of the

7157.199 --> 7163.638999999999
inserted force that momentum it's the

7161.04 --> 7166.199
response to the force the continuation

7163.639 --> 7168.56
the the

7166.199 --> 7171.839999999999
perpetuation of the

7168.56 --> 7171.84
force is

7172.719 --> 7178.44
momentum right but some things don't

7175.52 --> 7181.639
have that and so they don't retain the

7178.44 --> 7184.28
momentum if you throw air or you throw a

7181.639 --> 7187.92
balloon that you just blow up with air

7184.28 --> 7189.84
you throw it it goes

7187.92 --> 7191.84
boom poof

7189.84 --> 7194.4800000000005
just starts floating down right because

7191.84 --> 7196.28
you can give it like a real hard throw

7194.48 --> 7199.799999999999
it's not going to go anywhere because

7196.28 --> 7202.8
why doesn't have momentum I mean the

7199.8 --> 7206.119000000001
rubber of the balloon has a little bit

7202.8 --> 7210.52
momentum right because it's a solid it's

7206.119 --> 7213.079
rubber but the air within the balloon

7210.52 --> 7214.2390000000005
definitely does not have momentum and it

7213.079 --> 7218.04
will

7214.239 --> 7220.678999999999
prevent the rubber of the balloon from

7218.04 --> 7222.92
continuing its math it will actually

7220.679 --> 7226.2390000000005
block the momentum in a way

7222.92 --> 7226.2390000000005
even is

7227.199 --> 7234.28
interesting yeah it's it's not even like

7231.48 --> 7240.0
oh it doesn't have momentum you could

7234.28 --> 7240.0
actually argue that gases block

7242.04 --> 7250.679
momentum I never thought of

7245.36 --> 7254.48
that that's what friction is

7250.679 --> 7258.4400000000005
gas block momentum it's not just that it

7254.48 --> 7259.4
doesn't have it it blocks momentum and

7258.44 --> 7262.079
that's

7259.4 --> 7265.799999999999
friction that is the friction what does

7262.079 --> 7270.199
friction do it stops the

7265.8 --> 7273.639
force it slows it down so

7270.199 --> 7275.28
it's holy [ __ ] I never saw that I never

7273.639 --> 7277.52
made that direct

7275.28 --> 7282.5599999999995
connection it's not even that gas

7277.52 --> 7282.56
doesn't have momentum it stops

7283.28 --> 7290.159
momentum and that's what we know as

7287.679 --> 7293.36
friction

7290.159 --> 7296.239
huh you can also have solid on solid

7293.36 --> 7299.239
friction yeah you

7296.239 --> 7299.239
can

7299.48 --> 7304.679999999999
technically

7301.43 --> 7304.68
[Music]

7308.04 --> 7311.04
what

7317.84 --> 7322.1990000000005
that's nice that was my friend from n

7319.639 --> 7324.400000000001
sending me a text message happy birthday

7322.199 --> 7324.4
and

7325.36 --> 7330.119
everything how can something without

7327.88 --> 7333.119
mass cause

7330.119 --> 7333.119
friction

7337.199 --> 7340.96
what what do you mean

7347.96 --> 7351.2390000000005
something what the mass doesn't cause

7350.04 --> 7355.079
the

7351.239 --> 7355.079
friction why are you saying

7358.48 --> 7362.48
that why would you say that the mass

7361.159 --> 7365.0
causes the friction where are you

7362.48 --> 7365.0
getting that

7367.96 --> 7370.96
from

7373.36 --> 7379.28
see and now just the mystery continues

7375.639 --> 7382.639
about the gigantic misconception of what

7379.28 --> 7385.92
the hell Mass even

7382.639 --> 7389.2390000000005
is you're just saying like oh can't have

7385.92 --> 7393.4
friction without mass really

7389.239 --> 7393.4
why what does that have to do with

7393.8 --> 7396.8
it

7397.88 --> 7400.88
yeah

7401.92 --> 7410.1990000000005
doesn't air like doesn't like even

7407.079 --> 7413.0
helium could give

7410.199 --> 7415.638999999999
friction if there's enough of it and

7413.0 --> 7421.04
enough distance like it will slow down

7415.639 --> 7421.04
the momentum of an object even helium

7423.97 --> 7427.06
[Music]

7427.32 --> 7434.239
will nothing with no

7430.4 --> 7437.04
weight CA what where are you getting

7434.239 --> 7437.04
this nonsense

7438.48 --> 7443.4
from is there friction in the vacuum

7446.0 --> 7451.4
no lower the pressure of a gas the lower

7450.44 --> 7453.719
the

7451.4 --> 7456.4
friction I the pressure to hire the

7453.719 --> 7459.96
friction the gas does cause the friction

7456.4 --> 7463.679
it's just I don't see this relation to

7459.96 --> 7467.28
mass at all it has nothing to do with

7463.679 --> 7470.559
it just because you can oh is there a

7467.28 --> 7472.759999999999
mass here is there a mass there no oh

7470.559 --> 7474.2390000000005
well then it must be the mass oh really

7472.76 --> 7475.76
so you're just going to conclude it's

7474.239 --> 7480.48
just the mass it's just the mass that

7475.76 --> 7482.84
does it really based on what on

7480.48 --> 7485.0
correlation oh there's no Mass there oh

7482.84 --> 7487.119000000001
there's Mass here well friction must be

7485.0 --> 7488.8
caused by mass then oh really so what's

7487.119 --> 7491.079
the actual evidence for that other than

7488.8 --> 7492.719
you just seeing a correlation and

7491.079 --> 7496.84
assuming that it is a

7492.719 --> 7496.84
coration that's not how physics

7497.02 --> 7501.139
[Music]

7511.119 --> 7519.759999999999
works so any more correlation you want

7514.199 --> 7522.28
to draw a false causation into guys

7519.76 --> 7525.719
Palpatine T casc you seem to be very

7522.28 --> 7525.719
insistent about this hor

7529.0 --> 7534.639
[ __ ] so me friction from nothingness

7538.92 --> 7545.639
what it's logic to me yeah but it's not

7543.0 --> 7549.84
not evident

7545.639 --> 7553.079
though yeah correlation is not causation

7549.84 --> 7555.76
you remember that saying it's like one

7553.079 --> 7558.679
of the root warnings of the entire

7555.76 --> 7560.079000000001
science community that most of the

7558.679 --> 7561.76
science Community actually end up

7560.079 --> 7563.84
ignoring of course in favor of their

7561.76 --> 7566.04
barded

7563.84 --> 7567.679
fantasies but yeah it's kind of

7566.04 --> 7569.679
important yeah just because there's a

7567.679 --> 7573.84
correlation doesn't mean that that means

7569.679 --> 7573.84
it is the proof

7575.52 --> 7580.599
no

7577.599 --> 7580.599
yeah

7581.599 --> 7587.119000000001
I'll just be blunt I don't know what

7583.28 --> 7590.599
causes the friction in gas I don't

7587.119 --> 7590.598999999999
know counter

7592.079 --> 7596.92
pressure it's like maybe because when

7595.119 --> 7601.239
you move through gas you're going to

7596.92 --> 7603.32
press on it it has to press back try to

7601.239 --> 7605.718999999999
get out of the way and then maybe

7603.32 --> 7609.32
because of that enormous pressure it's

7605.719 --> 7611.36
the counter pressure of the gas like the

7609.32 --> 7613.719
direct response the compressing of the

7611.36 --> 7618.119
gas that actually makes it

7613.719 --> 7618.119
friction I don't know exactly how that

7619.76 --> 7625.719
works I just know that gas doesn't have

7622.48 --> 7628.799999999999
momentum that's provable very very proof

7625.719 --> 7630.96
it does not attain momentum you can

7628.8 --> 7634.92
throw a balloon that you blow up with

7630.96 --> 7636.92
regular air you can throw it you you

7634.92 --> 7640.2390000000005
could do anything with

7636.92 --> 7642.4400000000005
it but it will not attain momentum no

7640.239 --> 7646.919999999999
matter what you do how much force you

7642.44 --> 7650.04
put into it well it will absolutely do

7646.92 --> 7652.4
that if it's a solid object or if you

7650.04 --> 7654.88
fill the balloon with water if you fill

7652.4 --> 7658.558999999999
the balloon with water it will attain

7654.88 --> 7661.76
momentum it will not do so with gas and

7658.559 --> 7664.0
that's a fact you can't you can't bypass

7661.76 --> 7664.0
that

7665.44 --> 7672.48
fact SO gas doesn't have momentum but

7668.679 --> 7674.559
what it does do is it does slow down

7672.48 --> 7677.28
momentum provably and that we know that

7674.559 --> 7679.159000000001
is friction now to is two all the

7677.28 --> 7681.239
friction is because of mass well that's

7679.159 --> 7686.28
just a

7681.239 --> 7689.919999999999
desperate conclusion that's not based on

7686.28 --> 7692.159
actual facts it's just a shortly drawn

7689.92 --> 7695.0
conclusion based on

7692.159 --> 7698.119
desperation on the necessity in your

7695.0 --> 7702.719
mind for a gas to have mass somehow like

7698.119 --> 7702.719
that's called desperation it's not

7709.52 --> 7715.4400000000005
evidence resistance to momentum

7712.48 --> 7716.558999999999
resistance in an airplane troubles West

7715.44 --> 7718.839999999999
need

7716.559 --> 7723.719
to

7718.84 --> 7725.96
right friction resistance to momentum

7723.719 --> 7731.96
yeah but not

7725.96 --> 7731.96
momentum yeah resistance to momentum not

7733.92 --> 7740.4
momentum so it's the

7737.36 --> 7743.119
opposite friction is a resistance to

7740.4 --> 7746.679
momentum it isn't

7743.119 --> 7751.28
momentum the resistance to momentum is

7746.679 --> 7754.4400000000005
not related to the momentum

7751.28 --> 7757.639
ability it's exactly the

7754.44 --> 7761.678999999999
opposite it's not the other side of the

7757.639 --> 7765.96
same coin it's exactly the opposite yeah

7761.679 --> 7768.8
things that stop momentum that have

7765.96 --> 7769.679
friction like gases when you try to move

7768.8 --> 7772.719
through

7769.679 --> 7775.92
them that they resist they resist the

7772.719 --> 7778.2390000000005
momentum they don't have momentum

7775.92 --> 7782.96
though they

7778.239 --> 7782.959999999999
don't but they resist it it's

7784.84 --> 7790.32
interesting Newton's law oh my God

God

8022.28 --> 8027.32
wow right the fat M but that's messed up

8025.079 --> 8031.159
yeah it's one thing though Newtonian

8027.32 --> 8032.92
mechanics are bunk they're

8031.159 --> 8035.4
officially

8032.92 --> 8037.84
disclaimed within

8035.4 --> 8039.4
physics it's still Barts that are going

8037.84 --> 8040.719
to teach it and they'll still teach it

8039.4 --> 8044.4
to little

8040.719 --> 8048.8
kids but in physics Community it's

8044.4 --> 8052.36
officially recognized as no we don't use

8048.8 --> 8054.639
that that's heavily outdated it's

8052.36 --> 8056.88
incorrect proven to be physically

8054.639 --> 8061.76
incorrect

8056.88 --> 8061.76
disproven especially f equals

8062.0 --> 8068.679
ma is bunk they don't claim that anymore

8066.28 --> 8073.159
balart still

8068.679 --> 8075.84
do but they don't claim that like at the

8073.159 --> 8079.879999999999
University especially concerned yeah in

8075.84 --> 8082.159000000001
physics departments they know like no we

8079.88 --> 8085.679
don't actually use

8082.159 --> 8089.36
that any Citation for gas na having Mass

8085.679 --> 8094.2390000000005
it's right here I'm saying it I'm your

8089.36 --> 8094.239
citation I'm explaining it to you how it

8098.84 --> 8105.159000000001
doesn't you can make hydrogen gas from

8101.76 --> 8105.159000000001
water yeah that's cool hey

8113.639 --> 8119.8
Jim you would say

8116.8 --> 8119.8
no

8121.4 --> 8123.759999999999
to

8135.239 --> 8139.718999999999
what what what are you

8140.079 --> 8146.639
talking where does the M go when you

8142.48 --> 8149.44
boil it it doesn't exist

8146.639 --> 8156.52
anymore in it's

8149.44 --> 8159.5199999999995
done yeah why because mass is not

8156.52 --> 8159.52
molecular

8159.599 --> 8165.679
inherent a molecule does not have

8163.679 --> 8167.88
inherent Mass yeah they call it

8165.679 --> 8171.8
molecular mass you know what that is

8167.88 --> 8174.119
it's a very specific conditional form of

8171.8 --> 8177.079000000001
ratio ratio

8174.119 --> 8179.24
weighing in a very specific State you

8177.079 --> 8180.639
see

8179.24 --> 8183.44
[Music]

8180.639 --> 8185.52
they don't weigh the molecule in a

8183.44 --> 8187.719
gaseous State why you can't it's

8185.52 --> 8191.679
physically impossible to do that

8187.719 --> 8194.439
accurately you can't you can't figure it

8191.679 --> 8197.08
out so how do they do it well with

8194.439 --> 8200.0
helium for example they made it

8197.08 --> 8201.88
liquid and then they determin it

8200.0 --> 8206.12
specific

8201.88 --> 8207.92
density the density of it in a liquid

8206.12 --> 8212.28
state and that's been used for the

8207.92 --> 8214.84
molecular weight of it but weight and

8212.28 --> 8217.84
mass are not

8214.84 --> 8217.84
molecule

8218.479 --> 8223.639
inherent they're

8221.559 --> 8228.639
State

8223.639 --> 8231.639
inherent State not molecule State the

8228.639 --> 8235.199999999999
state is what makes it give weight and

8231.639 --> 8238.119999999999
mass not the molecule the molecule

8235.2 --> 8241.16
doesn't have the mass or the weight it's

8238.12 --> 8246.599
the state that gives it to

8241.16 --> 8246.599
it and takes it away as

8248.08 --> 8255.719
well so it goes away that's right it's

8252.679 --> 8258.719000000001
not inherent the molecule doesn't have

8255.719 --> 8263.08
inherent weight it's the state that

8258.719 --> 8263.08
gives the weight or takes it

8266.599 --> 8269.599
away

8273.92 --> 8284.29
[Music]

8289.32 --> 8292.43
[Music]

8296.519 --> 8299.519
okay

8321.679 --> 8326.519
damn it why can't I make this

8324.16 --> 8329.519
fit this is so

8326.519 --> 8329.519
annoying

8331.629 --> 8334.909000000001
[Music]

8340.24 --> 8345.719
[Music]

8342.88 --> 8345.719
okay I'll do it like

8348.359 --> 8356.28
this gas resists momentum but doesn't

8351.2 --> 8358.639000000001
have it and weight not molecule

8356.28 --> 8361.960000000001
inherent okay this is going to be it

8358.639 --> 8364.559
then like this is the best I can do this

8361.96 --> 8370.0
is the title gas resists momentum but

8364.559 --> 8370.0
doesn't have it weight not molecule

8371.96 --> 8378.319
inherent right I'm going to let the cat

8374.76 --> 8378.319
out be right

8386.439 --> 8391.98

8447.6 --> 8453.56
no I'm not entirely pleased though I

8449.28 --> 8453.560000000001
want to try it again molecule

8454.0 --> 8458.24
inherent weight dependent on

8459.52 --> 8462.92
state would that

8463.04 --> 8467.12
fit state it does

8467.16 --> 8470.219
[Music]

8476.24 --> 8479.24
fit

8496.6 --> 8499.909
[Music]

8501.2 --> 8506.0
yeah I guess I'll do it like that weight

8502.76 --> 8508.399
is dependent on state so gas resists

8506.0 --> 8511.84
momentum but doesn't have it and weight

8508.399 --> 8511.84
is dependent on state

8511.94 --> 8516.6
[Music]

8513.76 --> 8519.68
okay that's

8516.6 --> 8522.439

feedback on the

[Music]

8533.56 --> 8537.8
title people with rhetorical questions

8536.24 --> 8540.72

off you definitely get H or o Out of

8580.76 --> 8584.72
Water that's that's where it comes

8585.72 --> 8591.0
from yeah and the metals and the salts

8588.439 --> 8595.64
are merely

8591.0 --> 8600.24
catalysts yeah you know what K Cal a

8595.64 --> 8602.039999999999
damn it catalysts it's what it is it's

8600.24 --> 8605.68
molecular

8602.04 --> 8609.160000000002
transitions a bridge within the

8605.68 --> 8612.880000000001
reaction yeah that doesn't mean that

8609.16 --> 8615.439
that bridge is then dissolved is the

8612.88 --> 8618.88
thing that is actually being

8615.439 --> 8618.880000000001
turned it's a

8619.08 --> 8622.08
catalyst

8622.64 --> 8628.16
Catalyst wrong wrong oh hey why did you

8625.76 --> 8635.479
say wrong one more time and I'll [ __ ]

8628.16 --> 8635.479
ban you yeah do it say it one more

8639.24 --> 8645.76
time yeah your Metals salts and the

8642.76 --> 8648.800000000001
acids it's called a

8645.76 --> 8649.68
catalyst why did you say wrong one more

8648.8 --> 8652.679999999998
time

8649.68 --> 8652.68
harp

8656.0 --> 8659.0
huh

8663.6 --> 8669.16
an experiment you're

8666.8 --> 8670.679999999998
dependent hogen comes from the metals

8669.16 --> 8673.119999999999
and the

8670.68 --> 8676.279
salts yeah well that's called a baseless

8673.12 --> 8680.04
claim that you can't

8676.279 --> 8680.04
back you can't back

8685.72 --> 8691.519999999999
it you can I don't give a [ __ ] about his

8689.12 --> 8695.359
[ __ ] comments I've heard this Pete

8691.52 --> 8698.52
and Pete garbage for years it's

8695.359 --> 8700.720000000001
literally retardation in the

8698.52 --> 8703.359
mind it's

8700.72 --> 8706.92
nonsense oh it isn't what it is yes it

8703.359 --> 8708.880000000001
is and it does happen what is said that

8706.92 --> 8711.64
happens and if you don't even know what

8708.88 --> 8714.278999999999
a [ __ ] catalyst is you need to get

8711.64 --> 8717.84
the [ __ ] out of

8714.279 --> 8722.08
here yeah yeah and I will ban you here

8717.84 --> 8722.08
for inserting your

8722.8 --> 8730.24
misinformation har I will ban you here

8725.6 --> 8730.24
for your misinformation just like

8733.359 --> 8738.52
that so so why don't you say wrong one

8736.359 --> 8740.16
more time when I tell you yeah those

8738.52 --> 8743.560000000001
materials that you need for that

8740.16 --> 8743.56
reaction they're called

8743.92 --> 8748.64
catalysts yeah it's the stuff you need

8746.92 --> 8753.72
need for the

8748.64 --> 8758.64
reaction yeah it's not from

8753.72 --> 8760.8
that yeah go ahead yeah see you bye bye

8758.64 --> 8764.96
[ __ ] with

8760.8 --> 8768.8
bye chemistry denyer who is incorrect

8764.96 --> 8771.96
doesn't know what chemistry is

8768.8 --> 8773.479
practically yeah and more hor [ __ ] from

8771.96 --> 8776.039999999999
your

8773.479 --> 8778.679999999998
side somebody who thinks that they can

8776.04 --> 8784.2
have their own version of chemistry

8778.68 --> 8784.2
right yeah I don't think so it's called

8784.479 --> 8788.56
misinformation like provable

8795.6 --> 8798.729000000001
[Music]

8800.64 --> 8807.358999999999
misinformation car manufactures are

8802.72 --> 8810.8
wrong about into H yeah I know

8807.359 --> 8813.12
it's it's so tiresome I I don't even

8810.8 --> 8816.92
like want to go into the details of it

8813.12 --> 8816.92
because it's Pete and Pete hor

8819.88 --> 8824.438999999998
[ __ ] it's just saying like no it doesn't

8822.439 --> 8827.0
work like

8824.439 --> 8830.24
that it's like saying like yeah when you

8827.0 --> 8833.52
burn something there isn't a heavy

8830.24 --> 8835.92
oxygen reaction it's not happening it's

8833.52 --> 8837.319000000001
not taking the oxygen from the air to

8835.92 --> 8839.0
fuel the

8837.319 --> 8843.039999999999
chemical reaction the combustion

8839.0 --> 8846.04
reaction it's not happening

8843.04 --> 8849.080000000002
like you're

8846.04 --> 8853.439
nuts you're just wrong you're just

8849.08 --> 8856.439
denying basic things it's

8853.439 --> 8856.439
ridiculous

8858.84 --> 8863.04
yeah and hey there's other ways to make

8861.2 --> 8865.800000000001
hydrogen too did you know like you can

8863.04 --> 8868.960000000001
get it out of zinc can make a zinc acid

8865.8 --> 8870.358999999999
reaction that's cool it's not happening

8868.96 --> 8872.16
in the water the water is just going to

8870.359 --> 8874.52
be the Catalyst in that case you're not

8872.16 --> 8877.96
going to extract the hydrogen from the

8874.52 --> 8882.319000000001
water but instead you use zinc and some

8877.96 --> 8885.919999999998
acid and then you get this hydrogen gas

8882.319 --> 8891.399
from the zinc not from the water that's

8885.92 --> 8894.359
cool right yeah that's called another

8891.399 --> 8897.16
reaction but you can definitely do it

8894.359 --> 8901.24
with the water and then you have to use

8897.16 --> 8904.479
these catalytic materials make a

8901.24 --> 8907.92
catalyst Catalyst and then you will see

8904.479 --> 8911.24
the water slowly reduce in amount it

8907.92 --> 8915.68
starts bubbling and that will turn into

8911.24 --> 8919.08
gas and most of that Catalyst material

8915.68 --> 8920.800000000001
is still going to be there maybe

8919.08 --> 8923.039999999999
transformed there's all kinds of

8920.8 --> 8925.278999999999
reactions happening

8923.04 --> 8927.479000000001
there it's still going to be there it's

8925.279 --> 8929.479000000001
not gone the catalyst

8927.479 --> 8931.119999999999
is not

8929.479 --> 8932.76
dissolved

8931.12 --> 8937.479000000001
yeah

8932.76 --> 8939.76
water water has evaporated it is gone it

8937.479 --> 8939.76
has

8941.16 --> 8945.96
reacted yeah that's where the hydrogen

8943.6 --> 8948.2
and the oxygen came from that came out

8945.96 --> 8948.199999999999
of

8950.68 --> 8953.819
[Music]

8955.52 --> 8958.52
that

8969.88 --> 8974.8
what in your body okay yes sure AGM I

8973.52 --> 8975.43
don't know what has has to do with

8974.8 --> 8978.739
anything

8975.43 --> 8978.739
[Music]

8985.52 --> 8988.52
but

8993.76 --> 8997.079
[Music]

9000.04 --> 9005.880000000001
right can I get some feedback from

9001.96 --> 9008.479
people with wrenches it's been a

9005.88 --> 9012.199999999999
while like to get some feedback on my

9008.479 --> 9014.64
title do you get it Richard G blue build

9012.2 --> 9018.439
Evolution maybe seeking star water still

9014.64 --> 9018.439
out there somewhere

9020.24 --> 9024.96
slowmo moon buggy can I get some

9022.479 --> 9027.96
feedback it's been very very quiet from

9024.96 --> 9027.96
you guys for a long

9038.08 --> 9042.8
time oh okay Stevie that's

9045.439 --> 9048.439
interesting

9053.55 --> 9056.83
[Music]

9064.17 --> 9067.479
[Music]

9065.92 --> 9070.88
I don't know if they're still here I

9067.479 --> 9070.88
have no idea I'd hope they

9075.359 --> 9079.6
were

9077.08 --> 9082.56
you wish you understood this come on

9079.6 --> 9086.16
duper do you understand the title I mean

9082.56 --> 9089.519999999999
these are like pretty straightforward

9086.16 --> 9089.52
statements aren't

9091.8 --> 9096.199999999999
they right gas resists momentum but

9094.84 --> 9101.24
doesn't have

9096.2 --> 9104.68
it so that resisting momentum that's

9101.24 --> 9107.56
friction it doesn't have momentum it

9104.68 --> 9109.359
stops momentum it doesn't have it

9107.56 --> 9111.64
also weight dependent on state well

9109.359 --> 9113.960000000001
that's the whole issue right like oh gas

9111.64 --> 9116.96
has mass no it doesn't it does so when

9113.96 --> 9119.08
you compress it it's no longer gas now

9116.96 --> 9122.119999999999
it gets

9119.08 --> 9126.2
weight so what do you conclude it's not

9122.12 --> 9129.68
molecular inherent it's state

9126.2 --> 9129.68
dependent it's very

9132.6 --> 9139.0
straightforward Rich showday thanks

9134.88 --> 9139.0
Richie exercise oh that's

9139.24 --> 9143.6
okay

9141.04 --> 9145.880000000001
what great what do you think of the

9143.6 --> 9148.12
title Richard G I want to feedback of

9145.88 --> 9148.119999999999
the

9149.84 --> 9154.279
title what do you mean you don't know

9151.84 --> 9156.319
what resists momentum means I just told

9154.279 --> 9159.720000000001
you duper that's

9156.319 --> 9159.72
friction air

9161.479 --> 9168.16
friction what do you think that is what

9164.6 --> 9169.84
is air friction it's resisting of

9168.16 --> 9171.479
momentum

9169.84 --> 9174.319
something

9171.479 --> 9178.599999999999
goes an

9174.319 --> 9180.84
object like is thrown through the air

9178.6 --> 9184.16
what makes it slow

9180.84 --> 9187.0
down what is stopping the

9184.16 --> 9189.119999999999
momentum friction friction of the medium

9187.0 --> 9191.2
it's going through the

9189.12 --> 9195.160000000002
air

9191.2 --> 9197.240000000002
see so gas resists momentum it has

9195.16 --> 9200.319
friction

9197.24 --> 9204.08
but it itself does not have momentum it

9200.319 --> 9204.08
stops the momentum it doesn't have

9207.64 --> 9213.64
it it will trigger some globies oh yeah

9211.64 --> 9216.88
oh I'm sure I'm GNA have like five more

9213.64 --> 9219.439
spam mails this evening you don't know

9216.88 --> 9223.679999999998
what you're talking about you're so

9219.439 --> 9225.960000000001
old get the one day I'm going to like

9223.68 --> 9228.04
just save some of those meals and share

9225.96 --> 9231.56
them just to show

9228.04 --> 9235.68
like just the

9231.56 --> 9237.64
weirdos that send me this mail like the

9235.68 --> 9241.319
people that send me these emails they

9237.64 --> 9242.479
literally sound like those complaining

9241.319 --> 9245.319
gamma

9242.479 --> 9247.8
grabler cartoon figures that Omen

9245.319 --> 9250.8
Benjamin sometimes like

9247.8 --> 9254.319
references like they literally sound

9250.8 --> 9256.84
like everything you do is wrong like

9254.319 --> 9258.399
like that exactly like that they're just

9256.84 --> 9262.04
like

9258.399 --> 9263.439
that and I mostly ignore it just kind of

9262.04 --> 9268.04
in the hopes it will go away but it's

9263.439 --> 9270.0
been going for like months months every

9268.04 --> 9273.2
day like these people are like what the

9270.0 --> 9275.359
[ __ ] like I'm doing a show every day

9273.2 --> 9278.479000000001
it's like that's some effort that I make

9275.359 --> 9282.12
to like try to keep going and these

9278.479 --> 9285.08
people write complaining

9282.12 --> 9286.640000000001
emails every

9285.08 --> 9291.2
day

9286.64 --> 9295.56
that's their profession I

9291.2 --> 9295.560000000001
guess that's gay yeah no

9296.17 --> 9306.08
[Music]

9302.04 --> 9309.240000000002
[ __ ] friction is confusing to me

9306.08 --> 9312.72
why why is it confusing something is

9309.24 --> 9316.56
moving it's getting stopped something is

9312.72 --> 9318.199999999999
trying to stop it from moving on yeah

9316.56 --> 9319.92
there's something moving then there's

9318.2 --> 9323.2
something that's

9319.92 --> 9326.439
stopping it's stopping it from

9323.2 --> 9326.439
moving that's

9326.76 --> 9332.84
friction it's getting in the

9329.85 --> 9335.92
[Music]

9332.84 --> 9339.56
way right you fall in the water the

9335.92 --> 9344.16
water breaks your fall how does it do

9339.56 --> 9344.16
that well it breaks your

9344.96 --> 9350.479
momentum it presses back it gives this

9348.88 --> 9352.759999999998
friction

9350.479 --> 9355.278999999999
effect and so if you're still going to

9352.76 --> 9357.04
fall in water because you're heavier

9355.279 --> 9359.16
like much denser you like would have to

9357.04 --> 9362.399000000001
have a weight on you well then you're

9359.16 --> 9364.52
still going to fall at a slower speed

9362.399 --> 9365.96
than in the air because the water has a

9364.52 --> 9369.319000000001
way higher

9365.96 --> 9369.319
friction than the

9372.359 --> 9379.279
air blockage yeah yeah you could see it

9375.68 --> 9379.279
like that it is like blockage

9385.319 --> 9390.08
yes right and because of it you have

9388.12 --> 9394.12
such a thing as terminal

9390.08 --> 9396.16
velocity right you're falling high high

9394.12 --> 9397.319000000001
in the air and you keep falling and yeah

9396.16 --> 9401.64
at the

9397.319 --> 9403.6
beginning it goes pretty fast but not

9401.64 --> 9405.519999999999
that fast and then it goes faster and

9403.6 --> 9407.880000000001
faster faster faster and faster but

9405.52 --> 9407.880000000001
eventually

9408.16 --> 9413.92
you will stop accelerating because the

9410.52 --> 9417.640000000001
acceleration rate is being

9413.92 --> 9421.359
neutralized or even out by the friction

9417.64 --> 9423.519999999999
of the air pushing back basically like

9421.359 --> 9426.279
friction like no you're not coming

9423.52 --> 9429.76
through we're going to stop you the the

9426.279 --> 9432.2
air just being silly in my description

9429.76 --> 9434.52
but it's pushing back and then

9432.2 --> 9439.08
eventually it will even out the amount

9434.52 --> 9442.359
of friction the push back will be equal

9439.08 --> 9442.359
to the amount of

9442.399 --> 9448.24
force of the

9445.24 --> 9450.56
fall and then you will not accelerate

9448.24 --> 9452.319
further you will stay at that steady

9450.56 --> 9456.24
falling speed and that's what they call

9452.319 --> 9459.72
terminal velocity it's where the

9456.24 --> 9463.16
friction basically prevents the

9459.72 --> 9466.16
acceleration from making you go even

9463.16 --> 9468.319
yeah I'm not saying it right it's where

9466.16 --> 9469.399
the acceleration basically stops and a

9468.319 --> 9471.24
steady

9469.399 --> 9473.92
speed

9471.24 --> 9475.68
happens cuz it can't accelerate any

9473.92 --> 9478.52
further you can't or if you're the one

9475.68 --> 9480.2
falling you can't accelerate any further

9478.52 --> 9485.52
because the friction is like

9480.2 --> 9485.52
neutralizing it is preventing further

9487.52 --> 9494.6
acceleration had came on right oh sorry

9490.359 --> 9494.6
about that I can't help

9494.72 --> 9501.199999999999
it

9497.31 --> 9503.519999999999
[Music]

9501.2 --> 9505.6
why don't you block them they're in my

9503.52 --> 9507.92
spam mail duper by the way yeah those

9505.6 --> 9510.880000000001
emails I can't stop

9507.92 --> 9514.279
them I can't stop them from appearing in

9510.88 --> 9514.278999999999
my spam mail box

9521.24 --> 9526.08
so I mean I'm not even really reading

9523.92 --> 9529.12
them I'm just like looking like wow

9526.08 --> 9530.68
another SP spam mail from that guy and

9529.12 --> 9531.880000000001
there's like three guys or something

9530.68 --> 9535.52
that do

9531.88 --> 9538.479
this and every time is like one person

9535.52 --> 9540.319000000001
and they do it for like a week and then

9538.479 --> 9544.24
they kind of stop for a bit and then

9540.319 --> 9544.24
another guy just does it for like a

9547.279 --> 9552.439
week I don't know I think there might be

9549.84 --> 9554.880000000001
like a little crazy little grabler gang

9552.439 --> 9557.24
that is just like trying to actively

9554.88 --> 9559.839999999998
demotivate me doing

9557.24 --> 9562.76
that I think they might be actually

9559.84 --> 9566.2
trying that it's really

9562.76 --> 9566.2
bizarre and not

9573.92 --> 9578.12
working give me an example of

9579.68 --> 9585.720000000001
friction

9581.319 --> 9586.479
okay you accelerate in a car you drive

9585.72 --> 9589.56
what

9586.479 --> 9592.0
happens you go faster and faster

9589.56 --> 9594.72
eventually you will start to notice

9592.0 --> 9598.16
there's like this thing pushing against

9594.72 --> 9600.8
the car you will feel this force of a

9598.16 --> 9606.319
constant push on it what is that that's

9600.8 --> 9609.479
the friction of the air you're passing

9606.319 --> 9611.96
through the faster you go the heavier

9609.479 --> 9615.88
that push back will

9611.96 --> 9618.358999999999
be until eventually like yeah when you m

9615.88 --> 9621.88
max out the gas

9618.359 --> 9624.439
pedal you'll have this steady speed

9621.88 --> 9626.08
where like you can't go any faster cuz

9624.439 --> 9629.24
the friction if there was no air

9626.08 --> 9631.96
friction You' keep going faster and

9629.24 --> 9633.72
faster why because there's nothing

9631.96 --> 9640.759999999998
stopping

9633.72 --> 9640.76
you there's no friction to stop the

9642.64 --> 9648.119999999999
momentum right you're in a solid object

9645.12 --> 9650.160000000002
it will have momentum and it will only

9648.12 --> 9653.6
slow down again because it's being

9650.16 --> 9656.64
stopped by friction pretty much friction

9653.6 --> 9658.439
of the gas and of the internal mechanics

9656.64 --> 9660.0
that also give a little bit of friction

9658.439 --> 9663.16
although they always try to minimize

9660.0 --> 9663.16
that of course with good

9664.359 --> 9668.399000000001
design but if there was no friction then

9666.76 --> 9670.92
you would just keep on going forever and

9668.399 --> 9673.16
they even theorize this in space travel

9670.92 --> 9675.6
oh you go to deep vacuum and you just

9673.16 --> 9677.039999999999
give one little boost and then boo you

9675.6 --> 9680.16
just go

9677.04 --> 9682.240000000002
10,000 kilm an hour and it'll never

9680.16 --> 9685.24
decrease in speed because there's no

9682.24 --> 9687.0
gases there to stop you and slow you

9685.24 --> 9688.8
down there's no friction there so once

9687.0 --> 9692.359
you attain that speed you just keep on

9688.8 --> 9695.358999999999
going forever yeah that's all

9692.359 --> 9697.960000000001
theoretical considerations based on the

9695.359 --> 9701.24
Assumption there's no gas to slow you

9697.96 --> 9704.438999999998
down to create the

9701.24 --> 9706.16
friction like we have here on Earth in

9704.439 --> 9710.76
reality

9706.16 --> 9712.68
there's always gas to slow you down to

9710.76 --> 9716.52
create that friction to stop the

9712.68 --> 9716.52
momentum to resist the

9727.72 --> 9733.8
momentum sound can make glass shatter

9731.16 --> 9736.319
that's friction no it isn't now that's

9733.8 --> 9738.8
called resonance

9736.319 --> 9738.8
that's not

9739.68 --> 9745.52
friction like an oscillation you

9742.88 --> 9748.839999999998
just and then can make it break if you

9745.52 --> 9752.560000000001
just hit the right frequency then the

9748.84 --> 9755.68
moving around of it of the glass like it

9752.56 --> 9758.039999999999
will not properly be able to

9755.68 --> 9760.479000000001
redistribute all the forces that the

9758.04 --> 9763.359
glass is being subjected to within that

9760.479 --> 9766.88
sound frequency which will then make it

9763.359 --> 9770.68
shatter it's nothing to do with

9766.88 --> 9773.88
friction it's resonance and

9770.68 --> 9773.880000000001
absorbing the

9781.12 --> 9784.439
forces that's

9785.84 --> 9792.6
right I mean you could create sound

9790.2 --> 9796.240000000002
making friction like with your finger

9792.6 --> 9798.56
over the glass now that

9796.24 --> 9799.88
that sound is caused by the friction of

9798.56 --> 9802.479
your

9799.88 --> 9804.96
finger basically rubbing over the glass

9802.479 --> 9807.479
and then that friction is creating the

9804.96 --> 9809.599999999999
oscillation that makes the sound and the

9807.479 --> 9812.64
sound if it's especially a bad

9809.6 --> 9815.319
oscillation could then eventually

9812.64 --> 9817.358999999999
compromise the redistribution of the

9815.319 --> 9819.479
forces on the glass that would break it

9817.359 --> 9821.720000000001
but it's not the friction itself that

9819.479 --> 9824.479
makes that happen it's the resonance

9821.72 --> 9826.278999999999
that comes out of the friction that you

9824.479 --> 9829.039999999999
basically you create a sound with the

9826.279 --> 9831.279
friction and then that sound if it

9829.04 --> 9833.359
follows a very specific frequency could

9831.279 --> 9836.399000000001
then break the glass but it's not the

9833.359 --> 9836.399000000001
friction that does

9838.76 --> 9844.12
that it's the resonance that does it

9842.12 --> 9846.279
that's right

9844.12 --> 9849.880000000001
stey

9846.279 --> 9854.2
what does residance an electrical

9849.88 --> 9857.399
circuit res resonance what mean

9854.2 --> 9860.560000000001
resistance what electrical that's that's

9857.399 --> 9864.399
something completely different see

9860.56 --> 9867.16
me but that's Electronics I don't ask me

9864.399 --> 9867.16
about that I'm

9867.2 --> 9875.479000000001
not I'm not too well versed into like

9871.84 --> 9875.479
electronic intrical

9884.16 --> 9887.16
workings

9894.319 --> 9898.319
frictions countered when one surface

9896.24 --> 9901.52
comes over

9898.319 --> 9904.6
another yeah well you can have material

9901.52 --> 9907.52
or solid on solid material

9904.6 --> 9910.84
friction that's right and then it's the

9907.52 --> 9910.84
surface structure that will

9913.12 --> 9920.12
basically pull on the momentum of the

9916.6 --> 9922.359
other object and slow it down that's

9920.12 --> 9925.399000000001
also friction solid on solid doesn't

9922.359 --> 9926.11
work with liquids yeah only with solid

9925.399 --> 9927.8
on

9926.11 --> 9930.319000000001
[Music]

9927.8 --> 9935.0
solid but

9930.319 --> 9937.359
Air Gases does effect effectively also

9935.0 --> 9937.359
create

9941.12 --> 9947.0
friction and passing through

9944.08 --> 9949.92
water yeah it's like passing through the

9947.0 --> 9951.88
material causes the friction yeah when

9949.92 --> 9954.08
you have a solid surface against a solid

9951.88 --> 9955.88
surface it's not passing through it I

9954.08 --> 9958.6
mean the friction is so high with solid

9955.88 --> 9960.72
material there's simply none you can't

9958.6 --> 9963.04
go through it it completely stops the

9960.72 --> 9965.039999999999
momentum although then that makes makes

9963.04 --> 9966.76
an impact and you could literally sh the

9965.04 --> 9967.68
object in order to attempt to move

9966.76 --> 9970.84
through

9967.68 --> 9973.880000000001
it right but friction of M solid

9970.84 --> 9976.84
material and solid material is is one

9973.88 --> 9979.119999999999
way of friction but passing through

9976.84 --> 9980.56
material also has a friction and when

9979.12 --> 9984.640000000001
you pass through

9980.56 --> 9987.319
gas that gas gives some friction when

9984.64 --> 9990.88
you pass through water or other liquid

9987.319 --> 9993.16
it also has friction more friction than

9990.88 --> 9995.399
the air

9993.16 --> 9998.0
even

9995.399 --> 10000.64
right now solid material you would have

9998.0 --> 10003.64
to have one hell of a

10000.64 --> 10006.0
momentum to not be completely stopped by

10003.64 --> 10008.88
the friction of the material that's very

10006.0 --> 10010.64
unengaging like you can't normally move

10008.88 --> 10013.0
through solid matter you would have to

10010.64 --> 10016.399
have so much force to literally this

10013.0 --> 10017.82
integrate the matter shatter it bash

10016.399 --> 10021.18
through

10017.82 --> 10021.18
[Music]

10021.92 --> 10026.960000000001
it right and if you don't have enough

10024.12 --> 10030.439
Force then it will simply provide so

10026.96 --> 10032.438999999998
much friction friction that you the the

10030.439 --> 10033.56
momentum of the object will be

10032.439 --> 10036.2
completely

10033.56 --> 10039.439
stopped it has that much friction you

10036.2 --> 10041.399000000001
literally can't go through it normally

10039.439 --> 10044.92
without disintegrating without

10041.399 --> 10047.72
shattering it without neutralizing that

10044.92 --> 10050.16
friction factor that it has being a

10047.72 --> 10050.16
solid

10052.68 --> 10058.880000000001
object right and that's also like why

10055.2 --> 10060.439
you have like super

10058.88 --> 10063.278999999999
ballistic

10060.439 --> 10065.880000000001
guns like High super high powerered

10063.279 --> 10068.12
rifles or cannons

10065.88 --> 10070.88
that literally like they have special

10068.12 --> 10073.04
things and like those bullets can have

10070.88 --> 10074.679999999998
so much force behind them they'll

10073.04 --> 10077.92
literally pass through anything like

10074.68 --> 10081.64
butter they'll just shoot through

10077.92 --> 10083.6
steel just like that it's so much power

10081.64 --> 10086.96
it will literally just disintegrate

10083.6 --> 10089.92
whatever it touches without even

10086.96 --> 10093.96
like disintegrating the the bullet

10089.92 --> 10096.8
itself mostly right so it neutralizes

10093.96 --> 10096.8
the friction there

10097.24 --> 10103.64
of the solid material by literally

10100.479 --> 10106.76
changing it from solid material

10103.64 --> 10111.24
into slightly less solid

10106.76 --> 10111.24

10121.6 --> 10127.439

indoctrination from Priestly men that

10508.16 --> 10514.96
Christ that they claim to

represent yeah it's the anti

10514.96 --> 10522.8
Christ that's what that is you're part

10517.68 --> 10525.0

Antichrist you're

10528.359 --> 10535.12

[ __ ]

10535.359 --> 10539.399000000001
[ __ ] because of your

10553.2 --> 10559.319000000001
Christian yeah only Heaven you're going

10556.0 --> 10562.239
to end up in it's the one that Satan

10559.319 --> 10563.88
creates in the delusional world yeah

10562.239 --> 10566.72
that's that happen where you're going to

10563.88 --> 10570.64
end up with guess what yeah it will be

10566.72 --> 10573.479
exactly as was atti you'll get

10570.64 --> 10575.8
exactly what the priests say that you

10573.479 --> 10578.64
get there and guess what that's going to

10575.8 --> 10581.72
be like when you actually get there when

10578.64 --> 10583.16
you get that reward yeah you know what

10581.72 --> 10586.278999999999
it's going to be

10583.16 --> 10590.479
like it's going to be like

10586.279 --> 10593.359
hell huh but you were too

10590.479 --> 10596.479
preoccupied to even realize that about

10593.359 --> 10598.56
it to actually think things through like

10596.479 --> 10602.76
most Christians they don't actually

10598.56 --> 10605.76
thinks think things

10602.76 --> 10608.52
through yeah they don't listen to what

10605.76 --> 10610.52
Jesus says how it works what is real

10608.52 --> 10614.16
what isn't how you should do

10610.52 --> 10616.68
things not really not when it's like oh

10614.16 --> 10619.359
my core faith is tested I I must repeat

10616.68 --> 10621.960000000001
the chance or I'm designated for

10619.359 --> 10626.479000000001
hell oh yeah really where did Christ say

10621.96 --> 10630.039999999999
that exactly oh you can only come to God

10626.479 --> 10634.278999999999
through me yeah oh does that mean all

10630.04 --> 10636.800000000001
that that really because I'm pretty sure

10634.279 --> 10639.0
that it doesn't mean that at all when

10636.8 --> 10641.399
Christ say that yeah it doesn't mean at

10639.0 --> 10646.12
all hey hey hey there's this stupid

10641.399 --> 10648.92
little chant about how I am the Son and

10646.12 --> 10651.399000000001
the father and the holy ghost at the

10648.92 --> 10653.92
same time and I pray to myself and if

10651.399 --> 10658.16
you don't believe that you're going to

10653.92 --> 10661.2
go to hell a place that I don't even

10658.16 --> 10666.359
claim exists during my

10661.2 --> 10668.560000000001
lifetime huh huh that's how [ __ ] dumb

10666.359 --> 10668.56
you

10669.8 --> 10675.92
are

10672.68 --> 10675.92
yeah you

10682.6 --> 10687.319
[ __ ] Antichrist Christian yeah

10685.56 --> 10690.16
there's a lot of it it's the majority

10687.319 --> 10692.278999999999
the Dumber you are the more annoying you

10690.16 --> 10695.119999999999
are at it cuz you're going to defend

10692.279 --> 10696.399000000001
your little group you don't even

10695.12 --> 10700.239000000001
understand what the [ __ ] it is you're

10696.399 --> 10703.96
defending you're defending Antichrist

10700.239 --> 10706.279
Christianity you don't even know it yeah

10703.96 --> 10708.839999999998
you'll be so adamant about it that

10706.279 --> 10713.04
you'll still think it's a virtue to to

10708.84 --> 10715.359
tolerate gay we're modern now oh so

10713.04 --> 10717.960000000001
modern oh we have to tolerate all these

10715.359 --> 10720.08
things that are blatantly tearing down

10717.96 --> 10724.119999999999
every single value that we

10720.08 --> 10726.76
have where gays like publicly say like

10724.12 --> 10730.160000000002
all Christians must be persecuted and

10726.76 --> 10732.399
removed yeah but I mean maybe tolerating

10730.16 --> 10734.359
it hanging around some of those people

10732.399 --> 10736.199999999999
I'm sure that's the great Christian

10734.359 --> 10738.880000000001
thing to do right you must always

10736.2 --> 10742.359
tolerate your opponent that vows to

10738.88 --> 10745.239
eradicate you sure that that's that's

10742.359 --> 10747.76
the people they're they're the right

10745.239 --> 10750.399
ones yeah not the guy that's just going

10747.76 --> 10752.84
to like tell you how it is and confront

10750.399 --> 10756.119999999999
you harshly with your own

10752.84 --> 10759.72
delusion tell you when you're just wrong

10756.12 --> 10762.68
with EV backed by evidence no hang with

10759.72 --> 10762.679999999998
those other

10763.08 --> 10770.68
people because they don't confront you

10767.88 --> 10773.96
with that you believe in something that

10770.68 --> 10776.68
is contradicted by the person that you

10773.96 --> 10779.119999999999
claim is a god even though they didn't

10776.68 --> 10779.12
claim

10779.239 --> 10785.479
that because you're not supposed

10782.84 --> 10790.2
to that's

10785.479 --> 10790.199999999999
illegal yeah it's called

10790.68 --> 10797.399
idolatry it's illegal in the rules it's

10794.52 --> 10800.0
illegal in the rules while Christ was

10797.399 --> 10803.119999999999
alive he knew

10800.0 --> 10804.96
that isn't he abiding by the law isn't

10803.12 --> 10808.399000000001
he like the

10804.96 --> 10811.0
Messiah yeah oh so oh but but then that

10808.399 --> 10812.8
means okay it's idolize him you can do

10811.0 --> 10815.359
it with him right there's always an

10812.8 --> 10818.479
exception I mean there's no God before

10815.359 --> 10821.279
me except this

10818.479 --> 10823.56
guy yeah that's yeah of course there's

10821.279 --> 10825.800000000001
always one exception there's always one

10823.56 --> 10828.119999999999
good reason to break all those

10825.8 --> 10831.319
fundamental rules that shall never be

10828.12 --> 10832.279
broken without a price right it's always

10831.319 --> 10834.88
a good

10832.279 --> 10837.800000000001
exception that's going to be inherent in

10834.88 --> 10840.839999999998
the core of your faith it'll lead you to

10837.8 --> 10843.72
if you don't chant this nonsense you go

10840.84 --> 10846.2
to hell a place that's not even clear

10843.72 --> 10848.76
claim to Exist by the person that I

10846.2 --> 10854.960000000001
worship into a god even though he said

10848.76 --> 10859.72
he wasn't one oh yes through me you come

10854.96 --> 10861.72
to the father oh through me you come

10859.72 --> 10866.08
to

10861.72 --> 10870.599999999999
me my father yeah you have to go through

10866.08 --> 10873.72
me to go to me my father no that's not

10870.6 --> 10875.640000000001
what that says at all you're just Direct

10873.72 --> 10879.438999999998
changed in your logical

10875.64 --> 10880.519999999999
interpretation in favor to go along with

10879.439 --> 10885.16
the

10880.52 --> 10888.880000000001
masses the men who claim they know all

10885.16 --> 10890.84
about it and I'll tell you exactly how

10888.88 --> 10894.319
to think about

10890.84 --> 10896.56
it so that you don't

10894.319 --> 10902.16
listen to the

10896.56 --> 10905.119999999999
words of the person you claim is a God

10902.16 --> 10906.96
that's how pathetic you Antichrist

10905.12 --> 10911.279
Christians

10906.96 --> 10914.839999999998
are yeah you don't listen to the person

10911.279 --> 10920.6
that you claim falsely is a

10914.84 --> 10924.04
God that's how ridiculous you are yeah

10920.6 --> 10927.359
but you go and you go ahead and be a fan

10924.04 --> 10931.12
of of that little [ __ ] Channel yeah

10927.359 --> 10933.84
I'm sure God the almighty God's going to

10931.12 --> 10936.399000000001
be really okay with that I mean it's not

10933.84 --> 10941.319
like there's something against that sort

10936.399 --> 10942.88
of thing at all right it's okay all is

10941.319 --> 10945.08
forgive and you just have to chant a

10942.88 --> 10947.8
little chant and all these [ __ ] devil

10945.08 --> 10950.68
things that you do there be without any

10947.8 --> 10952.199999999999
consequences yeah do as thou Wilt all

10950.68 --> 10954.76
you have to do is to do the little

10952.2 --> 10957.2
stupid chant and everything is fine

10954.76 --> 10960.92
there is no consequences to anything you

10957.2 --> 10964.16
do right yeah that's called

10960.92 --> 10965.68
Satanism I'm not part of that

10964.16 --> 10969.039999999999
there is a consequence for everything

10965.68 --> 10973.0
you do I'm not going to fool myself or

10969.04 --> 10977.479000000001
anybody else into that not being

10973.0 --> 10981.88
absolute reality the law of

10977.479 --> 10985.199999999999
nature the law of God things work the

10981.88 --> 10988.319
way they do and just by

10985.2 --> 10991.08
thinking that it doesn't do that doesn't

10988.319 --> 10994.68
mean it's going to do that yeah that's

10991.08 --> 10996.84
you just deluding yourself then it works

10994.68 --> 10999.319
different than it really

10996.84 --> 11002.2
does and I'm not going to be a part of

10999.319 --> 11005.319
that and if everybody anybody else here

11002.2 --> 11008.84
wants to show up and get caught with

11005.319 --> 11011.039999999999
some [ __ ] JC level recommendation in

11008.84 --> 11014.880000000001

hang around [ __ ] because you think

11032.0 --> 11038.439

11049.0 --> 11055.399
you

11051.359 --> 11055.399000000001

11170.2 --> 11174.960000000001
[ __ ] losers out

11172.2 --> 11178.399000000001
there just to make fun at me I mean is

11174.96 --> 11180.64
it that bad me T giving you a Stern

11178.399 --> 11182.88
talking to kicking you out calling you a

11180.64 --> 11184.96
[ __ ] maybe you weren't even a [ __ ]

11182.88 --> 11189.239
maybe you were you just need really

11184.96 --> 11191.72
needed to be told what you are yeah it's

11189.239 --> 11193.56
it's so bad you can't handle that at

11191.72 --> 11196.84
all you're going

11193.56 --> 11199.8
to Cozy up with a freaking [ __ ] out

11196.84 --> 11202.2
there with the [ __ ] anti-wind videos

11199.8 --> 11205.199999999999
is it so

11202.2 --> 11205.2
bad

11205.88 --> 11211.199999999999
I mean just because I'm shouting at you

11208.279 --> 11213.640000000001
doesn't mean that you are

11211.2 --> 11216.880000000001
devalued

11213.64 --> 11219.199999999999
yeah if AGM just said like yeah it's

11216.88 --> 11222.438999999998
kind of stupid I I

11219.2 --> 11225.720000000001
agree and I'll delete that video from my

11222.439 --> 11227.56
playlist I would have been like cool it

11225.72 --> 11232.16
would be no

11227.56 --> 11235.519999999999
problem but no he had to tell me I don't

11232.16 --> 11235.52
I don't want to be with with a

11235.96 --> 11240.64
non-Christian really you think jamiec

11238.56 --> 11243.08
level is a Christian do

11240.64 --> 11246.039999999999
you

11243.08 --> 11248.52
okay sure that's what Christians do

11246.04 --> 11250.960000000001
these days and I mean if that's a

11248.52 --> 11253.720000000001
Christian then a Christian is just a

11250.96 --> 11257.358999999999
[ __ ] Satanist it's a Satanist that

11253.72 --> 11260.88
call thems Christian that's a Christian

11257.359 --> 11264.12
now yeah you can be anything could be a

11260.88 --> 11266.8
communist you can be a [ __ ] can be

11264.12 --> 11269.0
anything you probably even be a pedo

11266.8 --> 11272.519999999999
openly and you still call yourself a

11269.0 --> 11275.52
Christian because you set the chant

11272.52 --> 11275.52
yeah

11278.92 --> 11283.64
right would make more sense to just not

11281.88 --> 11287.239
watch my show yeah but they can't help

11283.64 --> 11290.599999999999
thems because I'm just too

11287.239 --> 11294.72
interesting they can't stop

11290.6 --> 11299.279
it right

11294.72 --> 11301.358999999999
but I mean it's so dumb because I've had

11299.279 --> 11304.08
spats with

11301.359 --> 11306.399000000001
people a lot of them like most of you

11304.08 --> 11309.039999999999
here I've had a bump into with

11306.399 --> 11312.199999999999
especially here we go again like

11309.04 --> 11313.479000000001
periodically right what do you do you

11312.2 --> 11316.319000000001
just cut it

11313.479 --> 11319.119999999999
off you wait a little and then you come

11316.319 --> 11322.16
back and it's cool yeah here we go again

11319.12 --> 11324.279
got kind of pissed off for me like

11322.16 --> 11326.399
telling her to shut up up some time ago

11324.279 --> 11331.12
when she was really

11326.399 --> 11334.199999999999
yappy and she's here and it's it's fine

11331.12 --> 11335.960000000001
right not saying that yeah you still Pro

11334.2 --> 11337.16
if you think about it you probably still

11335.96 --> 11339.839999999998
didn't like

11337.16 --> 11342.2
it think back to it but like you're here

11339.84 --> 11344.239
now and everything seems just fine

11342.2 --> 11348.92
doesn't it here we go again you could

11344.239 --> 11348.92
just do that it's cool

11350.12 --> 11355.439
right you didn't go over to Jamie level

11353.52 --> 11357.960000000001
because I told you could you please shut

11355.439 --> 11360.279
up and like I don't want to have

11357.96 --> 11362.839999999998
anything to do with you

11360.279 --> 11366.76
anymore I'm going to be fan of jamc

11362.84 --> 11366.76
level now

11368.76 --> 11374.960000000001
right don't leave the paws hanging there

11371.359 --> 11374.960000000001
too long here we go again

11381.68 --> 11388.52
please oh my God okay fine I'll just

11385.479 --> 11388.519999999999
round out the show

11391.76 --> 11396.359
then you replied no you

11404.279 --> 11410.399000000001
didn't

11406.92 --> 11410.399
no no you

11411.84 --> 11414.84
didn't

11415.319 --> 11417.88
where's your

11422.439 --> 11428.64
reply yes I did I can see it oh really

11426.239 --> 11431.6
it's on screen my chat's on screen set

11428.64 --> 11434.278999999999
the live yet no you didn't whatever you

11431.6 --> 11437.04
typed it didn't come

11434.279 --> 11439.960000000001
through you can say it with exclamation

11437.04 --> 11439.960000000001
marks it's not

11441.84 --> 11444.84
there

11445.479 --> 11449.16
yes you don't say anything behind your

11447.56 --> 11452.119999999999
back that you wouldn't say to my face

11449.16 --> 11455.399
yeah good copy and paste okay well I can

11452.12 --> 11458.279
see it now but as you can see on the

11455.399 --> 11460.68
screen it's not

11458.279 --> 11463.04
there so whatever happened I didn't get

11460.68 --> 11463.04
to see

11471.76 --> 11475.04
it all

11478.04 --> 11484.279
right all right so the point is is

11481.8 --> 11486.479
that yeah there's going to be friction

11484.279 --> 11488.68
here and there between us between me and

11486.479 --> 11488.679999999998
my

11489.64 --> 11493.64
followers why the hell did that

11499.439 --> 11504.76
happen hey dude you don't have to send

11502.319 --> 11504.76
me anything

11506.84 --> 11510.12
thing you

11513.0 --> 11516.0
gift

11516.399 --> 11521.519999999999
what buffering perhaps that's the

11519.64 --> 11525.64
problem uh

11521.52 --> 11528.6
no no that was that was my

11525.64 --> 11532.76
OBS it just didn't appear I showed it on

11528.6 --> 11534.68
screen let's drop it okay I got the

11532.76 --> 11537.6
message you don't need to repeat it you

11534.68 --> 11540.880000000001
said something it didn't show up you

11537.6 --> 11543.359
repeated it let's be done with it okay

11540.88 --> 11543.358999999999
let's move

11546.16 --> 11550.84
on don't need proof I'm not saying you

11549.08 --> 11553.0
made it up I'm just saying it didn't

11550.84 --> 11555.64
appear here that's

11553.0 --> 11558.84
all please don't make this any more

11555.64 --> 11558.84
complicated than it needs to

11561.64 --> 11564.64
be

11570.72 --> 11578.84
right my point was is that yeah there's

11575.0 --> 11580.72
friction between my fans people that

11578.84 --> 11581.84
come here and have discussions and a

11580.72 --> 11583.96
talk and a

11581.84 --> 11586.64
follow and me there's going to be

11583.96 --> 11586.64
friction it

11587.16 --> 11594.56
happens yeah I test people that's

11590.68 --> 11597.52
annoying though yeah it is

11594.56 --> 11600.92
dude I've been having my video freeze

11597.52 --> 11602.359
the entire stream here we go again like

11600.92 --> 11605.64
every five

11602.359 --> 11610.12
seconds my video feed is

11605.64 --> 11612.96
like every five seconds this entire damn

11610.12 --> 11617.800000000001
stream three hours I had I've been

11612.96 --> 11619.839999999998
refreshing like 50 80 times or something

11617.8 --> 11622.199999999999
okay I'm not even joking not

11619.84 --> 11624.239
exaggerating so yeah this stupid

11622.2 --> 11627.800000000001
annoying [ __ ] going

11624.239 --> 11627.8
on it's not

11628.0 --> 11634.479
ideal but I mean as long as in the

11631.72 --> 11638.0
recording it's not continually video

11634.479 --> 11641.56
freezing then it's all it should all be

11638.0 --> 11644.399
fine right I mean there's

11641.56 --> 11646.519999999999
friction there being friction me being

11644.399 --> 11650.0
angry to you is not a good reason to

11646.52 --> 11652.68
suddenly have anti Arwin video or jamc

11650.0 --> 11656.08
level videos in your playlist or on your

11652.68 --> 11658.399
Channel if you do that then it's over if

11656.08 --> 11661.16
I discover you have it there then I

11658.399 --> 11665.16
don't give a [ __ ] what your [ __ ]

11661.16 --> 11667.92
reason is for having that I will ban you

11665.16 --> 11673.08
and you will not be

11667.92 --> 11675.68
unbanned unless you remove that material

11673.08 --> 11675.68
from your

11676.72 --> 11683.599999999999
Channel all

11679.72 --> 11685.278999999999
right I think it's generally understood

11683.6 --> 11688.04
by

11685.279 --> 11691.68
now I I know for certain that Richard G

11688.04 --> 11694.239000000001
and slowo moon you get it and you two

11691.68 --> 11694.239
here we go

11697.72 --> 11703.08
again you don't even know who he is good

11700.64 --> 11706.119999999999
he's just some stupid [ __ ] that makes

11703.08 --> 11710.2
really stupid anti- rwin

11706.12 --> 11713.800000000001
videos and even anti Nathan too

11710.2 --> 11716.479000000001
everybody really likes it

11713.8 --> 11716.479
for some

11722.0 --> 11726.359
reason I mean if his videos were

11724.76 --> 11729.08
actually

11726.359 --> 11731.16
funny then I might even have a laugh

11729.08 --> 11734.439
over it and be like Oh okay that's kind

11731.16 --> 11735.96
of funny but it isn't funny they're

11734.439 --> 11739.52
really

11735.96 --> 11744.399
lame they're really really

11739.52 --> 11747.720000000001
lame like Sean haw hins level

11744.399 --> 11749.439
lame it's like oh I made an animation

11747.72 --> 11751.84
and with that animation oh that was

11749.439 --> 11756.16
really challenging you made a really

11751.84 --> 11758.8
pointless Sean Hawkins level

11756.16 --> 11765.08
video

11758.8 --> 11769.039999999999
yeah why does anybody even care I don't

11765.08 --> 11771.319
understand I don't

11769.04 --> 11774.319000000001
why why do they like

11771.319 --> 11774.319
him

11775.479 --> 11778.8
you don't like it when Crips join the

11776.96 --> 11781.0
chat you're to point and I'm very

11778.8 --> 11784.72
thankful that you do here we slow M moon

11781.0 --> 11788.56
buggy so please

11784.72 --> 11788.56
definitely definitely keep

11789.3 --> 11792.439999999999
[Music]

11795.52 --> 11801.560000000001
pointing I really do appreciate you for

11798.56 --> 11803.92
for pointing that out and I'm really

11801.56 --> 11806.6
pissed at a I thought that a and me were

11803.92 --> 11807.92
cool again but apparently he could let

11806.6 --> 11810.880000000001
it

11807.92 --> 11813.479
go I don't believe in a stupid [ __ ]

11810.88 --> 11817.198999999999
little [ __ ] chant that he

11813.479 --> 11819.479
does it contradicts the words of the

11817.199 --> 11821.52
person they claim to be

11819.479 --> 11825.56
God

11821.52 --> 11828.52
yes guess that was too much for

11825.56 --> 11831.519999999999
him right I mean it's so

11828.52 --> 11833.76
insulting for somebody to say that that

11831.52 --> 11837.199
you're immed mediately going to draw in

11833.76 --> 11839.479
like a an open homosexual who makes

11837.199 --> 11844.239000000001
videos that make fun of that person

11839.479 --> 11845.88
because that that makes you a good

11844.239 --> 11848.72
Christian

11845.88 --> 11851.16
yes of

11848.72 --> 11853.438999999998
course right anyway I'll stop whining

11851.16 --> 11855.52
about it I'm going to round out the show

11853.439 --> 11857.56
this birthday show it's been kind of

11855.52 --> 11860.800000000001
Rowdy but interesting the whole

11857.56 --> 11863.319
discussion about gas resist resisting

11860.8 --> 11865.599999999999
momentum and not having it is an

11863.319 --> 11867.68
interesting micro development for me

11865.6 --> 11869.04
it's a direct connection that I hadn't

11867.68 --> 11874.319
really

11869.04 --> 11876.04
seen in its full display like that so

11874.319 --> 11878.439
there is ongoing

11876.04 --> 11880.880000000001
development with it with the insights

11878.439 --> 11884.239
about it right also of course weight

11880.88 --> 11887.319
being State dependent dependent on state

11884.239 --> 11890.88
is very critical in its Insight like

11887.319 --> 11893.56
that's like one sentence that is like a

11890.88 --> 11896.399
rottal that gets a whole bunch of

11893.56 --> 11898.319
misunderstandings out of the way like it

11896.399 --> 11903.439
really is

11898.319 --> 11906.278999999999
that like when you involve weight it's

11903.439 --> 11908.399
pretty much exclusively about the state

11906.279 --> 11911.16
and not about the

11908.399 --> 11913.278999999999
molecule it's the state it's the state

11911.16 --> 11916.399
that matters the same molecule can have

11913.279 --> 11919.76
weight can not have not weight no weight

11916.399 --> 11921.119999999999
at all more weight less weight depending

11919.76 --> 11924.0
on the

11921.12 --> 11927.399000000001
state

11924.0 --> 11930.12
yeah so weight that material has can

11927.399 --> 11933.439
just be lost oh it's no more weight it's

11930.12 --> 11935.640000000001
gone no weight and then you transform

11933.439 --> 11936.92
the state again and oh so it got weight

11935.64 --> 11939.519999999999
the thing that didn't have weight

11936.92 --> 11943.0
suddenly has weight yeah yeah that's

11939.52 --> 11946.16
just the way it

11943.0 --> 11949.08
is that's how it

11946.16 --> 11950.96
works yeah I'm sorry if that doesn't fit
