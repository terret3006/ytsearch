enough

113.41 --> 116.59
[Music]

117.119 --> 121.04
no harp didn't cause that

124.24 --> 131.68
julio pabino's first terror

127.84 --> 136.0
nathan oakley hey good to see you

131.68 --> 136.0
yeah i've got green tea with me

140.8 --> 144.959
it was a trumpet right

147.599 --> 155.28
it's wednesday last wednesday this year

151.04 --> 157.84
the 30th december 2020

155.28 --> 157.84
woof

159.92 --> 164.72
so friday is going to be the first of

168.84 --> 173.76
january

170.64 --> 173.76
how time has flown

174.959 --> 185.12
i finally started the show on time how

177.2 --> 186.79999999999998
about that guys and i feel a bit heavy

185.12 --> 188.64000000000001
at this moment i don't know why

186.8 --> 191.44
maybe i might have something to do that

188.64 --> 195.51899999999998
was watching some flat water video

191.44 --> 197.68
from a year ago it's pretty intense

195.519 --> 201.36
stuff sometimes

197.68 --> 203.519
just these yeah these testimonies get

201.36 --> 205.44000000000003
these experiences with interacting with

203.519 --> 206.4
angels and going to hell and all that

205.44 --> 209.92
and

206.4 --> 212.799
the descriptions and yeah as an empath

209.92 --> 214.319
that kind of like it is really unnerving

212.799 --> 215.28
because there's something really big to

214.319 --> 219.16
that

215.28 --> 220.959
on other levels not just exoteric and

219.16 --> 226.0
[Music]

220.959 --> 228.31900000000002
it's just so heavy stuff

226.0 --> 230.0
terrible audio well he he always has

228.319 --> 233.599
audio issues

230.0 --> 234.64
video i was watching had like terribly

233.599 --> 237.83999999999997
low audio

234.64 --> 237.83999999999997
that was really annoying

238.56 --> 244.799
but still it is he it is

241.599 --> 254.959
worth watching especially the

244.799 --> 257.12
the ones that he doesn't mess up

254.959 --> 260.079
he's also i don't know what program he

257.12 --> 269.52
uses but he's a terrible sound editor

260.079 --> 272.479
like terrible

269.52 --> 273.28
but anyway it's yeah he got he has great

272.479 --> 276.4
imagery

273.28 --> 276.4
at least always

278.0 --> 283.51
he has his pc fan running full blast

281.04 --> 285.44
really i had noticed that

283.51 --> 288.08
[Music]

285.44 --> 289.84
maybe a few videos he has all kinds of

288.08 --> 293.44
sounds issues i don't know what

289.84 --> 293.44
what his deal is with that

295.52 --> 297.84
um

302.639 --> 311.84000000000003
good job on discord yesterday was it

306.8 --> 311.84000000000003
man i don't even remember what that was

311.919 --> 317.52
i should make a note thanks for

314.479 --> 317.52
reminding me julia

320.24 --> 325.84000000000003
oh yeah it was on the after show

328.88 --> 332.88
that wasn't live i don't know if

330.4 --> 339.84
somebody might have been recording

332.88 --> 339.84
it was weird

340.98 --> 344.04900000000004
[Music]

350.84 --> 353.84
uh

360.24 --> 367.84000000000003
hey here we go again good to see you

369.759 --> 373.759
yeah i think that with all the

372.319 --> 375.68
temperature and all the weather and

373.759 --> 380.319
all the excitement going yeah i think i

375.68 --> 382.56
got a cold but it's just minor it's

380.319 --> 384.56
it happened it's like so light that i

382.56 --> 384.88
was i even have to like think about it

384.56 --> 388.08
like

384.88 --> 390.479
is this a cold or isn't it because it's

388.08 --> 390.88
not completely constant and i don't have

390.479 --> 394.0
any

390.88 --> 396.479
like major palpable symptoms or

394.0 --> 397.759
anything except for just constant

396.479 --> 401.59999999999997
sniffiness or

397.759 --> 402.72
not constant more and i sneeze a lot

401.6 --> 405.12
more

402.72 --> 406.47900000000004
but it's not constant it's just more

405.12 --> 409.68
regular

406.479 --> 412.31899999999996
or whatever

409.68 --> 413.52
it's about to happen maybe it also yeah

412.319 --> 416.47900000000004
that i did drink that

413.52 --> 417.19899999999996
alcohol two days ago that might have

416.479 --> 420.96
also like

417.199 --> 420.96000000000004
pushed it to do that

421.12 --> 424.639
yeah by the way i just left it to that

423.039 --> 427.44
because after that i just didn't feel

424.639 --> 431.039
like doing that again

427.44 --> 432.08
it was just sampling i do that all the

431.039 --> 434.88
time

432.08 --> 436.12
just for my senses like i have to know

434.88 --> 437.44
what it's like

436.12 --> 439.599
[Music]

437.44 --> 442.08
when i don't do something anymore it's

439.599 --> 442.88
but it requires discipline because if i

442.08 --> 445.199
don't have

442.88 --> 446.96
a real decision and discipline behind it

445.199 --> 450.479
then yeah you just switch

446.96 --> 451.68
back to the old thing but that only

450.479 --> 453.68
works if you haven't

451.68 --> 455.759
actually really made up your mind about

453.68 --> 455.759
it

456.4 --> 460.71999999999997
so you're not committed to the new

458.319 --> 461.759
setting as it were and then yeah then

460.72 --> 464.47900000000004
you switch back

461.759 --> 466.24
but yeah that basically is disorder on

464.479 --> 467.599
the higher level

466.24 --> 469.44
because you don't really know what you

467.599 --> 471.919
want you don't have control over what

469.44 --> 471.919
you want

472.96 --> 475.75899999999996
where you're going

476.72 --> 481.759
and to a certain level what's real so i

479.12 --> 483.84000000000003
don't have that problem thank god

481.759 --> 486.96000000000004
at this time but i have had experiences

483.84 --> 493.84
with that in the past as do many

486.96 --> 493.84
most people

494.96 --> 498.4
but it was interesting experience

496.639 --> 500.72
because it just the

498.4 --> 501.67999999999995
yeah the half strength beer with the

500.72 --> 506.56
lemon juice

501.68 --> 509.28000000000003
it wasn't anything like what it was

506.56 --> 510.319
and that's that like made it kind of

509.28 --> 512.399
worth it

510.319 --> 513.839
to do it just that one time to realize

512.399 --> 515.919
like wow

513.839 --> 518.24
when your entire attitude changes and

515.919 --> 521.36
all that

518.24 --> 524.48
different energy management

521.36 --> 528.48
yeah then it doesn't do the same thing

524.48 --> 530.9590000000001
and that's just like whoa okay

528.48 --> 533.6
i learned something from that and now

530.959 --> 537.4399999999999
i'm done with it

533.6 --> 539.44
it's not worth it it's kind of almost

537.44 --> 541.6800000000001
like i dispelled the longing because i

539.44 --> 545.6
had been staring at it like oh

541.68 --> 547.5999999999999
yeah what if and i did it and now it's

545.6 --> 550.72
like oh it's not

547.6 --> 551.9200000000001
what i had hoped for i'm gonna take that

550.72 --> 555.6
serious and now i

551.92 --> 558.16
yeah i don't care anymore so i guess i'm

555.6 --> 560.839
in a way i got rid of a problem with it

558.16 --> 562.959
so progress

560.839 --> 565.2
see

562.959 --> 565.1999999999999
ah

567.12 --> 576.5600000000001
now is my sound coming through yeah my

569.04 --> 579.279
sound is good

576.56 --> 591.8389999999999
but julio pabin remind me yesterday what

579.279 --> 591.8389999999999
the discussion was like on discord

592.88 --> 597.68
i think a neighbor somewhere in the in

595.519 --> 598.5600000000001
the building is playing violin i can

597.68 --> 601.3599999999999
hear them

598.56 --> 601.3599999999999
through the walls

623.81 --> 633.8389999999999
[Music]

626.16 --> 633.8389999999999
so how's everybody doing

636.24 --> 642.88
it's been five minutes i'm trying to

639.519 --> 642.88
interact with the chat here

644.839 --> 652.0
ah

647.44 --> 652.0
oh you're driving right all right

656.56 --> 664.7199999999999
i know qe eventually jumped in

660.88 --> 668.959
because it was about optics i think

664.72 --> 672.839
and that guy was constantly pinning

668.959 --> 676.7199999999999
some kind of quote on me about

672.839 --> 678.32
using subject matter expert

676.72 --> 680.1600000000001
what the hell was his name again i

678.32 --> 682.8000000000001
forgot

680.16 --> 683.279
i i don't use him that's why it was like

682.8 --> 686.3199999999999
stop

683.279 --> 687.279
telling me that i use that i never even

686.32 --> 689.44
mention him i

687.279 --> 692.88
i don't even know the name since i

689.44 --> 692.8800000000001
forgot what was it again

694.0 --> 697.76
thomas or something or

699.92 --> 704.079
ugh i can't think of it

710.32 --> 714.9590000000001
anyway i think that guy addressed

712.079 --> 717.68
terrestrial refraction

714.959 --> 718.4799999999999
or something and he did study into

717.68 --> 721.519
optics and

718.48 --> 722.48
qe uses him a lot as a hostile witness i

721.519 --> 724.9590000000001
think

722.48 --> 726.5600000000001
he explained that a couple of times and

724.959 --> 728.8
i'm very well aware of that

726.56 --> 731.279
now that doesn't make me an expert at it

728.8 --> 733.5999999999999
and i don't use him i avoid him because

731.279 --> 745.8389999999999
i find him very confusing

733.6 --> 745.839
what is his name again

746.56 --> 752.5699999999999
i'm a complete blank

749.43 --> 752.5699999999999
[Music]

756.24 --> 761.519
wait maybe i can find it in skype

759.04 --> 761.519
somewhere

770.8 --> 775.4399999999999
ah no that's gonna take ages

778.079 --> 789.1999999999999
anybody here

786.48 --> 792.32
does anybody in chat have a clue who i

789.2 --> 792.32
might be referring to

799.12 --> 806.559
says one

801.09 --> 806.5590000000001
[Music]

815.839 --> 820.48
okay so because now otherwise the

818.48 --> 822.399
conversation is going to run in a

820.48 --> 825.9200000000001
complete dead end

822.399 --> 828.0
so yeah that's that was that

825.92 --> 830.56
i'm not gonna wait for like 10 minutes

828.0 --> 833.12
until somebody figures out the name

830.56 --> 835.5189999999999
anyway i was discussing that he was

833.12 --> 840.0
trying to strawman me with it

835.519 --> 840.0
and when's my birthday in february

840.839 --> 843.839
anyway

844.639 --> 852.0
and yeah i discussed optics

848.399 --> 854.56
it was kind of a back and forth on a

852.0 --> 855.36
yeah with a baller i guess it was good

854.56 --> 858.16
to do that again

855.36 --> 858.16
it's been a while

860.0 --> 864.88
because i don't really like to get to

862.959 --> 866.6389999999999
engage with that sort of thing it's just

864.88 --> 870.959
annoying it's

866.639 --> 874.24
makes me angry and restless

870.959 --> 878.4799999999999
like agitated and that carries through

874.24 --> 878.48
on the rest of my life i don't like it

881.76 --> 885.519
but this was good my cat has decided he

884.079 --> 888.0
wants to eat raw meat

885.519 --> 888.0
okay

892.56 --> 899.279
yeah i used to give my cat raw meat

896.56 --> 900.2399999999999
on a regular basis but she was kind of

899.279 --> 902.72
raised

900.24 --> 902.72
like that

904.32 --> 913.839
hey dank

917.68 --> 920.0
all right

922.48 --> 927.9200000000001
right here we go and just i don't know

924.48 --> 932.0790000000001
if if it hasn't been raised with it

927.92 --> 935.12
then just keep it to small quantities

932.079 --> 941.8389999999999
don't let them engorge on it

935.12 --> 941.839
too much anyway

957.31 --> 963.8389999999999
[Music]

959.92 --> 965.12
so any afterthoughts on my hangout

963.839 --> 968.0790000000001
yesterday

965.12 --> 968.88
i went pretty hard at it at alex jones

968.079 --> 973.04
that

968.88 --> 973.04
really it was some time building

974.0 --> 979.44
i don't feel happy about it at all but i

977.04 --> 982.8
think i made that pretty clear

979.44 --> 983.9200000000001
because of the history like for crying

982.8 --> 987.12
out light i

983.92 --> 989.5999999999999
i've literally been yeah advertising his

987.12 --> 991.92
products on my own channel just like

989.6 --> 991.9200000000001
that

992.16 --> 996.7199999999999
and i can't say that yeah the products

995.519 --> 1000.8
are not bad they're

996.72 --> 1003.839
really great but it's just

1000.8 --> 1007.92
this guy you know like where he what he

1003.839 --> 1007.9200000000001
indulges himself to do it's just

1008.839 --> 1011.839
ugh

1015.12 --> 1018.48
and in a way i'm glad that owen benjamin

1017.68 --> 1021.7589999999999
also

1018.48 --> 1025.839
has him on his list like that i'm glad

1021.759 --> 1028.24
of it

1025.839 --> 1028.8799999999999
but yeah it's it's been very tough

1028.24 --> 1032.559
because

1028.88 --> 1034.16
yeah i got i i was basically getting out

1032.559 --> 1036.6399999999999
flanked

1034.16 --> 1037.6000000000001
in my kind of holding on to yeah but

1036.64 --> 1041.8390000000002
he's okay

1037.6 --> 1044.319
you know because of the memories and

1041.839 --> 1045.6
getting flanked from every side like it

1044.319 --> 1049.28
could not find

1045.6 --> 1051.9189999999999
well yeah a couple of people but

1049.28 --> 1052.72
they got it they just they weren't

1051.919 --> 1056.0800000000002
really like

1052.72 --> 1057.6000000000001
it's just there's nothing left it's like

1056.08 --> 1060.8799999999999
he wasted it all

1057.6 --> 1066.6799999999998
all his social social credit wasn't

1060.88 --> 1069.8190000000002
weird to use that word

1066.68 --> 1069.819
[Music]

1072.0 --> 1076.75
it's just it doesn't make me happy you

1074.24 --> 1078.48
know it was necessary in a way

1076.75 --> 1081.44
[Music]

1078.48 --> 1082.88
and i won i still wonder sometimes you

1081.44 --> 1086.799
know it's like

1082.88 --> 1087.679
will he ever basically just try to throw

1086.799 --> 1090.0
off this

1087.679 --> 1091.76
mantle this grappler mantle and just

1090.0 --> 1095.039
start doing what he used to do

1091.76 --> 1097.28
again you know

1095.039 --> 1099.52
i guess a lot of people are wondering

1097.28 --> 1099.52
that

1100.48 --> 1106.16
and they're maybe using that to hold on

1103.6 --> 1107.039
but i just i can't waste my time anymore

1106.16 --> 1109.679
with this

1107.039 --> 1112.24
like if he ever has some kind of bizarre

1109.679 --> 1115.2
revival that's not just another

1112.24 --> 1118.0
short-sighted theater piece attention

1115.2 --> 1122.96
grab because he's done that all the time

1118.0 --> 1125.44
then yeah then i'll notice it

1122.96 --> 1127.44
then i will notice it and then i might

1125.44 --> 1131.039
start paying attention again but i just

1127.44 --> 1137.8400000000001
don't really watch any of his

1131.039 --> 1141.039
shows anymore it's it's just

1137.84 --> 1141.039
it's become a drag

1141.36 --> 1144.1599999999999
pun intended

1148.96 --> 1153.52
right yeah there are some great moments

1151.039 --> 1156.64
i agree dank

1153.52 --> 1165.84
but that's the whole point you know

1156.64 --> 1165.8400000000001
it hasn't always been like this

1176.24 --> 1181.1200000000001
yeah if i could get like uh should i go

1179.2 --> 1183.8400000000001
into that

1181.12 --> 1186.799
i think that alex jones just got

1183.84 --> 1189.1999999999998
grappled by the heart and by the dick

1186.799 --> 1190.16
and with the dick i mean like rockets

1189.2 --> 1193.52
and space [ __ ]

1190.16 --> 1197.52
and by the heart like trump

1193.52 --> 1197.52
you see i think he just got caught

1199.919 --> 1206.4
and because of that he is just miserable

1203.36 --> 1209.6789999999999
like he he can't let go

1206.4 --> 1209.679
and that's punishing

1219.2 --> 1222.559
but yeah he's had some really good

1221.039 --> 1226.0
moments and

1222.559 --> 1229.2
like he he lives in this weird

1226.0 --> 1232.4
sort of almost

1229.2 --> 1233.52
like spiritual pecking order situation

1232.4 --> 1235.8400000000001
where there's

1233.52 --> 1237.52
plenty of people that are so much worse

1235.84 --> 1239.4399999999998
that has basically stepped into the

1237.52 --> 1242.8799999999999
abyss to some level

1239.44 --> 1246.159
you know that are much worse and he does

1242.88 --> 1248.24
know how to deal with them

1246.159 --> 1250.88
sometimes really well he's really

1248.24 --> 1253.44
focused when he does that

1250.88 --> 1255.5200000000002
and so yeah there's many great moments

1253.44 --> 1257.52
where he's confronting other journalists

1255.52 --> 1263.84
or other people

1257.52 --> 1263.84
it's yeah

1266.64 --> 1270.3600000000001
and what's sickening watching him fawn

1268.64 --> 1271.8400000000001
over trump yes

1270.36 --> 1274.3999999999999
[Music]

1271.84 --> 1276.32
well in the in the very beginning it was

1274.4 --> 1279.52
really awesome

1276.32 --> 1279.84
i was there like when trump was winning

1279.52 --> 1282.24
it

1279.84 --> 1284.72
it was awesome like really when you look

1282.24 --> 1287.84
back at it

1284.72 --> 1290.24
it was kind of magical but

1287.84 --> 1292.3999999999999
yeah as soon as the the grappling

1290.24 --> 1294.72
started showing

1292.4 --> 1296.96
the oddities and the bad decisions and

1294.72 --> 1304.32
just like things that were often

1296.96 --> 1306.48
unnerving then just everybody just

1304.32 --> 1307.52
people that were really on board they

1306.48 --> 1309.919
just started to

1307.52 --> 1309.9189999999999
become

1317.76 --> 1322.08
i convoluted he would take wolfgang yeah

1320.32 --> 1324.799
quarter yeah the sandy hook yeah that

1322.08 --> 1324.799
was terrible

1328.4 --> 1332.88
i never really got that like what the

1330.72 --> 1336.96
hell was all that

1332.88 --> 1336.96
so nonsensical like

1338.159 --> 1341.6000000000001
and he's weird like these

1341.919 --> 1347.039
so sort of confessions and then he

1344.559 --> 1350.72
basically denies they were real

1347.039 --> 1355.44
that sort of [ __ ] it's so weird and

1350.72 --> 1358.64
convoluting and i don't get it

1355.44 --> 1360.96
if you're like a truth journalist that

1358.64 --> 1364.7990000000002
is just like

1360.96 --> 1365.2
yeah just slide slicing your own risk

1364.799 --> 1369.039
and

1365.2 --> 1375.8400000000001
wrist in public it's it's crazy

1369.039 --> 1375.84
why did he do that

1376.4 --> 1380.64
yeah the bohemian grove videotape that

1378.48 --> 1381.84
was very interesting i've heard many

1380.64 --> 1385.039
people that are now

1381.84 --> 1386.32
like oh yeah but it was always a control

1385.039 --> 1388.72
opposition pro

1386.32 --> 1390.48
safanias are all over that [ __ ] now it's

1388.72 --> 1393.2
very hard to stop them

1390.48 --> 1393.76
it's become very hard to stop them

1393.2 --> 1397.28
because of

1393.76 --> 1402.0
the convolution that alex just keeps on

1397.28 --> 1404.6399999999999
throwing in

1402.0 --> 1405.12
but i still think that he did actually

1404.64 --> 1408.64
just

1405.12 --> 1411.12
sneak in that it was just a

1408.64 --> 1412.5590000000002
like a poker game to him he just had the

1411.12 --> 1417.84
balls to bluff it

1412.559 --> 1417.84
i really think he did back in the day

1418.72 --> 1424.799
but who knows maybe it was all just

1422.32 --> 1427.279
a big giant grabble from the start i

1424.799 --> 1427.279
don't know

1428.32 --> 1431.84
time will tell hopefully

1433.84 --> 1445.84
but it was a great ride for a big part

1450.559 --> 1453.9189999999999
he didn't ask trump anything that he

1453.2 --> 1458.64
should have

1453.919 --> 1459.44
he sold his listeners out well he was

1458.64 --> 1462.4
afraid

1459.44 --> 1462.4
and he was like

1463.52 --> 1469.039
he he tried to size it up spiritually

1467.039 --> 1471.6
there was a lot of energy in the air in

1469.039 --> 1475.52
the beginning you know

1471.6 --> 1477.84
and he just tried to size it up

1475.52 --> 1480.32
and just didn't want to overburden i

1477.84 --> 1483.52
didn't want to demand too much

1480.32 --> 1484.32
you know i don't see that as really let

1483.52 --> 1487.12
down

1484.32 --> 1489.6789999999999
his listeners like yeah maybe he screwed

1487.12 --> 1489.6789999999999
up a little

1493.52 --> 1500.0
but that's a long time ago now and

1496.559 --> 1515.76
things were very different the energy

1500.0 --> 1518.96
was very different

1515.76 --> 1520.559
yeah and for example

1518.96 --> 1523.44
here we go again now since you're in

1520.559 --> 1526.96
chat i'm pretty much addressing you

1523.44 --> 1527.6000000000001
compare it to babylon 5. like when you

1526.96 --> 1531.1200000000001
compare

1527.6 --> 1533.279
certain seasons in the spirit

1531.12 --> 1534.32
and the intensity and how everybody is

1533.279 --> 1537.76
and acts

1534.32 --> 1538.08
it's very different and then later it

1537.76 --> 1541.679
all

1538.08 --> 1545.039
changes around and it really shows that

1541.679 --> 1547.919
in a time span of basically one series

1545.039 --> 1549.279
so you should realize that that when the

1547.919 --> 1551.279
energy is different

1549.279 --> 1553.76
things are different there are processes

1551.279 --> 1555.2
like mystical processes that happen when

1553.76 --> 1557.679
the energy is high

1555.2 --> 1559.52
and when the energy is lower you forget

1557.679 --> 1562.64
that that exists

1559.52 --> 1565.84
so it looks completely different this

1562.64 --> 1566.5590000000002
is what happens in reality and babylon 5

1565.84 --> 1570.0
is like

1566.559 --> 1571.6789999999999
a really good thing that kind of shows

1570.0 --> 1575.84
that if you

1571.679 --> 1580.24
look for it if you if you care

1575.84 --> 1580.24
and they do address it a lot too

1581.36 --> 1587.279
they address it people talk about it

1584.96 --> 1588.64
in the series like how things change and

1587.279 --> 1590.559
things look different and

1588.64 --> 1591.679
they don't get very technical and

1590.559 --> 1595.84
elaborate

1591.679 --> 1598.64
but they do feel for it

1595.84 --> 1601.36
and they recognize that it exists and

1598.64 --> 1604.0800000000002
that is enough

1601.36 --> 1604.08
recognition

1607.0 --> 1612.96
[Music]

1608.559 --> 1615.2
right yeah great documentaries in the

1612.96 --> 1615.2
past

1616.88 --> 1623.2
yeah and it's funny also because now

1620.799 --> 1624.8799999999999
he basically did also set a lot of a

1623.2 --> 1628.559
standard

1624.88 --> 1632.48
he really did his best to get like this

1628.559 --> 1635.6789999999999
straight forward compacted

1632.48 --> 1637.279
information rich documentary style and

1635.679 --> 1638.64
that has become kind of like the

1637.279 --> 1641.44
conspiracy theory

1638.64 --> 1644.3990000000001
standard everybody tries to model after

1641.44 --> 1644.3990000000001
that in many ways

1645.039 --> 1649.52
but also things of basically the yeah

1647.919 --> 1651.76
the edges have been

1649.52 --> 1652.72
cut off shaved off more and more and

1651.76 --> 1656.24
it's just more

1652.72 --> 1658.48
infotainment now most things

1656.24 --> 1661.2
because of this yeah because people just

1658.48 --> 1665.1200000000001
want that broader audience

1661.2 --> 1665.1200000000001
then they have to get it simpler it's

1665.2 --> 1670.72
it's a bad trend for intellectual

1668.159 --> 1670.72
development

1674.24 --> 1683.84
a seeking star wars and dutch sailor by

1676.799 --> 1683.84
the way

1695.52 --> 1698.559
he was weak i think he screwed up a lot

1698.159 --> 1703.7600000000002
there

1698.559 --> 1703.76
where 100 documentaries

1708.84 --> 1711.84
what

1713.52 --> 1715.84
yes

1716.799 --> 1722.8799999999999
no well what he was doing is he was

1719.279 --> 1725.679
projecting his hopes onto trump

1722.88 --> 1728.0
it was like trying to give him an

1725.679 --> 1729.2
example to follow because he believed

1728.0 --> 1732.08
that trump was

1729.2 --> 1732.0800000000002
looking around

1733.279 --> 1736.32
to just try and do what's the best thing

1735.52 --> 1738.32
in the most

1736.32 --> 1739.6
american and compelling thing for the

1738.32 --> 1741.76
united states

1739.6 --> 1742.9599999999998
and he was saying that even he was open

1741.76 --> 1746.0
about it like look

1742.96 --> 1749.44
trump please listen to me

1746.0 --> 1752.88
but it just turns out that trump

1749.44 --> 1753.8400000000001
is sizing it up but his decisions that

1752.88 --> 1757.0390000000002
follow from it

1753.84 --> 1757.84
now these days don't seem to be focused

1757.039 --> 1760.799
as much

1757.84 --> 1763.4399999999998
onto that spirit he's just doing other

1760.799 --> 1763.44
agendas

1764.32 --> 1771.4399999999998
that are very against that and

1767.44 --> 1774.3990000000001
with it yeah alex is kind of stuck

1771.44 --> 1775.6000000000001
because it didn't work or maybe it

1774.399 --> 1781.84
worked for some time

1775.6 --> 1781.84
and now it doesn't work

1783.44 --> 1787.279
and in the meantime there are still a

1785.12 --> 1789.52
whole lot of people

1787.279 --> 1791.6
that are also still hanging on that are

1789.52 --> 1795.84
still like

1791.6 --> 1795.84
they are like on trump's side

1795.919 --> 1801.5200000000002
but they do like they have been

1798.96 --> 1802.08
taught about what is real you know it's

1801.52 --> 1803.6
the

1802.08 --> 1806.6399999999999
all the information spreads like

1803.6 --> 1809.52
wildfire like oh no vaccines and

1806.64 --> 1811.1200000000001
all these ideas alternative health it's

1809.52 --> 1813.12
they all know that

1811.12 --> 1816.4799999999998
so they just know like that what trump

1813.12 --> 1819.6
just said is completely idiotic

1816.48 --> 1821.6
but they might still be hanging on

1819.6 --> 1823.84
because of the movement because they

1821.6 --> 1825.37
feel like they are a front against

1823.84 --> 1827.039
the liberals

1825.37 --> 1830.799
[Music]

1827.039 --> 1835.039
it's yeah it's a pretty

1830.799 --> 1837.76
complex situation like everything is

1835.039 --> 1840.24
was growing and suddenly the setting has

1837.76 --> 1840.24
changed

1841.919 --> 1847.279
and now what does everybody do with this

1844.96 --> 1849.279
where where are they going now with this

1847.279 --> 1850.72
change setting with the spirit subtly

1849.279 --> 1853.6
different and the

1850.72 --> 1855.679
design of things don't the natural

1853.6 --> 1858.9599999999998
design doesn't fit as well

1855.679 --> 1859.519
so it becomes kind of without without

1858.96 --> 1861.679
purpose

1859.519 --> 1861.679
or

1862.559 --> 1867.2
yeah like in an amnesiac state don't

1865.279 --> 1869.279
fully understand what they were supposed

1867.2 --> 1872.32
to be doing anymore because

1869.279 --> 1875.84
reality isn't like that anymore it's

1872.32 --> 1881.2
yeah they lost the spirit it's fair it's

1875.84 --> 1881.1999999999998
it's very sad it's a tragedy

1887.12 --> 1891.1999999999998
really remember like it could have been

1889.84 --> 1894.48
really good

1891.2 --> 1897.919
like really good but it

1894.48 --> 1900.08
apparently wasn't meant to be

1897.919 --> 1900.0800000000002
it

1902.399 --> 1907.84
the price may have been too much

1909.919 --> 1913.8400000000001
and they just let it slide and just

1912.799 --> 1917.6
became

1913.84 --> 1920.0
like yeah like trump really became

1917.6 --> 1922.32
absorbed by the system again when he

1920.0 --> 1922.799
first had the options to stay separate

1922.32 --> 1924.72
and then

1922.799 --> 1935.84
i guess the price became too high

1924.72 --> 1935.84
whatever it was

1946.84 --> 1949.84
so

1955.039 --> 1959.44
right but in ways i still feel for the

1958.48 --> 1963.44
trumper crowd

1959.44 --> 1966.0
i think like yeah

1963.44 --> 1968.0
they are good willing brave people on

1966.0 --> 1971.36
average

1968.0 --> 1972.88
and just because the one that sort of

1971.36 --> 1976.1589999999999
rallied them

1972.88 --> 1977.279
is going nuts doesn't mean that they

1976.159 --> 1979.279
should just all

1977.279 --> 1980.559
scatter and just start doing other

1979.279 --> 1982.96
things or something

1980.559 --> 1985.039
you know well they're probably not doing

1982.96 --> 1987.279
that anyway but

1985.039 --> 1989.679
damn it it just seems like such a waste

1987.279 --> 1992.64
of momentum

1989.679 --> 1994.799
it's such a waste like there must they

1992.64 --> 1995.76
must find some kind of way through here

1994.799 --> 2005.15
just

1995.76 --> 2011.619
i don't know what it is

2005.15 --> 2011.6190000000001
[Music]

2016.84 --> 2019.84
so

2032.64 --> 2036.7990000000002
oh good creepy joking well it's all

2034.96 --> 2038.72
rigged it's just

2036.799 --> 2042.0
how it works now i think they're playing

2038.72 --> 2044.72
a game it's all rigged blatantly

2042.0 --> 2044.72
and they're just

2045.039 --> 2053.679
letting it the ex trying to

2050.359 --> 2055.839
bureaucratize it away and just make sure

2053.679 --> 2057.52
it takes so long before

2055.839 --> 2059.359
anything is going to be done about it

2057.52 --> 2061.919
that

2059.359 --> 2063.2
yeah that they can just put everything

2061.919 --> 2065.839
in place i think that that's the

2063.2 --> 2065.839
strategy

2065.919 --> 2071.359
and it's a crazy strategy

2069.28 --> 2074.3990000000003
because it's basically just let because

2071.359 --> 2077.119
of bureaucratic reasons letting yeah

2074.399 --> 2079.359
a fraudulent party just take over like

2077.119 --> 2079.359
that

2086.839 --> 2089.839
blatantly

2102.16 --> 2105.7599999999998
sleight of hand destruction

2106.72 --> 2111.7599999999998
well what if it's just a one-party

2108.72 --> 2111.7599999999998
system and they're just

2111.839 --> 2116.88
players on a theater piece

2115.04 --> 2119.119
and they're now psychologically

2116.88 --> 2122.4
attacking everybody making them in

2119.119 --> 2122.4
deeper into despair

2122.64 --> 2130.0
by doing this like to effectively

2126.8 --> 2131.76
shock everyone maybe that

2130.0 --> 2134.16
is the purpose of why it's happening

2131.76 --> 2145.8390000000004
like this

2134.16 --> 2145.839
it's like a punishment

2154.4 --> 2173.839
yeah yeah i know dean white

2159.52 --> 2173.839
so convoluted it's just insane

2175.12 --> 2178.219
[Music]

2179.68 --> 2186.0789999999997
oh that's a good one dutch sailor yeah

2183.04 --> 2189.2
sometimes it feels to me like we were in

2186.079 --> 2189.2000000000003
the movie hot fuzz

2189.76 --> 2193.5200000000004
yeah that movie certainly does

2194.16 --> 2198.56
it's a great and crazy movie

2199.04 --> 2215.839
but yeah no surprise there

2226.839 --> 2229.839
so

2234.88 --> 2241.119
owned by a faction of the grappler

2238.4 --> 2241.119
from the beginning

2241.68 --> 2257.839
i don't know how that works exactly but

2263.44 --> 2268.839
yeah but he certainly his background is

2265.599 --> 2271.839
very convoluted overall

2268.839 --> 2271.839
indeed

2281.04 --> 2285.839
all right

2296.16 --> 2299.839
feel like oh

2304.4 --> 2313.839
holy [ __ ] here we go again i never even

2306.88 --> 2313.839
thought about it like that

2323.83 --> 2327.0099999999998
[Music]

2349.839 --> 2369.839
yeah yeah build out by the banks

2354.0 --> 2369.839
married his daughter off

2376.88 --> 2383.839
pantomime yeah dean right well yeah

2380.88 --> 2383.839
sympathize with that

2388.0 --> 2391.44
i don't know but it did really seem at

2390.88 --> 2394.1600000000003
least

2391.44 --> 2396.4
you know it's it's i still like to keep

2394.16 --> 2400.0789999999997
the option open that it is kind of his

2396.4 --> 2403.359
choice that maybe he did he

2400.079 --> 2405.3590000000004
really have the power to do that and did

2403.359 --> 2406.64
he just choose not to because the price

2405.359 --> 2410.24
was too high for him

2406.64 --> 2410.72
in the moment or was it never meant to

2410.24 --> 2414.24
be

2410.72 --> 2417.4399999999996
in fact probably the people

2414.24 --> 2417.4399999999996
from the graveler side

2417.52 --> 2421.119
were always counting on him not to do

2419.839 --> 2423.92
that

2421.119 --> 2427.599
so yeah that's kind of how it works but

2423.92 --> 2427.599
he might have had that option

2429.92 --> 2442.559
you know it's uh there's always a choice

2439.46 --> 2442.559
[Music]

2449.119 --> 2454.1600000000003
the neighbors said god was sent by trump

2452.319 --> 2455.68
or the term was sent by god yeah yeah

2454.16 --> 2458.16
i've heard that a lot

2455.68 --> 2460.7999999999997
and in a way i believed that because at

2458.16 --> 2464.0
the time with all the energy

2460.8 --> 2466.96
it was like that because he was on the

2464.0 --> 2481.839
right frequency

2466.96 --> 2481.839
for the most part

2482.0 --> 2484.24
oh

2489.2 --> 2495.839
yeah i know dean right

2513.64 --> 2516.739
[Music]

2521.599 --> 2525.76
the funny thing is in my own way like i

2523.839 --> 2527.52
remembered it

2525.76 --> 2530.7200000000003
the things you're saying it makes a lot

2527.52 --> 2532.88
of sense it makes me remind that i

2530.72 --> 2537.2
that those things were already kind of

2532.88 --> 2539.52
discussed and apparent it's just that

2537.2 --> 2542.3999999999996
after things became so convoluted i just

2539.52 --> 2546.48
lost my patience and kind of like

2542.4 --> 2546.48
started to draw my attention away from

2548.839 --> 2553.44
it

2550.72 --> 2565.839
but the risk factor was always there

2553.44 --> 2565.839
from the beginning

2576.839 --> 2579.839
what

2580.4 --> 2584.319
okay seeking star wars what are you

2583.2 --> 2586.7999999999997
talking about

2584.319 --> 2587.92
there is evidence his ancestors owned

2586.8 --> 2593.8390000000004
some advanced

2587.92 --> 2593.839
tech what like what

2594.8 --> 2610.4990000000003
where's this going

2607.4 --> 2610.4990000000003
[Music]

2611.359 --> 2616.24
oh the time travel thing okay

2618.839 --> 2621.839
what

2635.28 --> 2638.88
here we go what the hell are you talking

2637.52 --> 2643.119
about

2638.88 --> 2643.119
the baron time travel what

2645.2 --> 2649.839
what is this

2657.76 --> 2665.8390000000004
what kind of a story is that about

2662.4 --> 2668.1600000000003
you mean baron trump time traveling what

2665.839 --> 2668.16
where

2669.599 --> 2677.839
what are you talking about

2683.23 --> 2686.329
[Music]

2693.76 --> 2705.8390000000004
what that's got to be

2697.44 --> 2705.839
up let's come on

2707.03 --> 2710.159
[Music]

2716.839 --> 2719.839
foreign

2729.89 --> 2733.04
[Music]

2745.52 --> 2751.119
okay well

2748.56 --> 2752.48
look if you find that video then yeah

2751.119 --> 2755.52
drop it

2752.48 --> 2757.839
in skype and i'll check it out but i

2755.52 --> 2759.7599999999998
remember there being a whole lot of very

2757.839 --> 2762.48
silly stuff going on

2759.76 --> 2764.6400000000003
conspiracy ideas with trump and yeah

2762.48 --> 2768.16
what do you expect

2764.64 --> 2769.5989999999997
he's so controversial and convoluted

2768.16 --> 2770.48
because of the media because of

2769.599 --> 2774.88
everything that

2770.48 --> 2778.16
yeah crazies of [ __ ]

2774.88 --> 2778.1600000000003
but i hadn't heard that one

2778.4 --> 2784.079
although yeah time traveling and all

2780.319 --> 2788.319
that in a way maybe

2784.079 --> 2789.6800000000003
but i just it just seems so

2788.319 --> 2791.44
i don't know if you found a video that

2789.68 --> 2794.0
was actually halfway interesting i'll

2791.44 --> 2794.0
check it out

2794.96 --> 2817.839
but i i highly doubt it

2802.8 --> 2817.8390000000004
it'll make a great b-grade movie

2824.079 --> 2831.8390000000004
weather energy weaponry what

2856.319 --> 2859.839
newt gingrich okay

2879.44 --> 2887.839
okay this is getting kind of silly now

2907.359 --> 2915.839
what dutch sailor what computer what

2910.16 --> 2915.839
what are you talking about

2917.44 --> 2921.2000000000003
you mean a crate 2 or something

2921.68 --> 2929.839
oh that's a very old machine though

2933.52 --> 2937.2
i don't know man computers these days

2936.72 --> 2943.839
are like

2937.2 --> 2943.839
so much faster it's insane

2996.839 --> 2999.839
so

3010.839 --> 3013.839
hmm

3038.9 --> 3042.059
[Music]

3047.119 --> 3055.839
let's have an old phone conversation

3049.2 --> 3055.839
over there

3066.319 --> 3069.839
thank you

3077.28 --> 3082.559
ah right okay let should i share an idea

3081.28 --> 3086.48
about that

3082.559 --> 3086.48
should i not hmm

3087.44 --> 3093.119
so i basically look i a whole

3090.88 --> 3095.04
while back it's now like three years or

3093.119 --> 3098.0
something maybe four years

3095.04 --> 3099.04
uh three years i wrote something about

3098.0 --> 3101.76
like

3099.04 --> 3102.16
time traveling on different levels i

3101.76 --> 3104.6400000000003
almost

3102.16 --> 3105.2799999999997
made like a game system account trying

3104.64 --> 3110.319
to build

3105.28 --> 3113.76
into a game for time travel

3110.319 --> 3115.599
and like because

3113.76 --> 3117.28
look you might be able to basically

3115.599 --> 3120.559
project yourself

3117.28 --> 3122.1600000000003
in another time if your spirit with your

3120.559 --> 3125.44
spirit basically

3122.16 --> 3126.5589999999997
so you would not physically be in the

3125.44 --> 3128.2400000000002
other timeline but

3126.559 --> 3129.76
you might be able to just project

3128.24 --> 3133.04
yourself as if

3129.76 --> 3135.3590000000004
you are really there and then it just

3133.04 --> 3137.89
goes away again

3135.359 --> 3140.92
almost like a holographic projection

3137.89 --> 3140.92
[Music]

3141.119 --> 3145.04
but maybe even physical i don't know how

3144.319 --> 3148.96
it works

3145.04 --> 3151.359
it's weird so

3148.96 --> 3153.04
yeah maybe that's the way they do it

3151.359 --> 3157.2799999999997
they do it kind of like with

3153.04 --> 3157.2799999999997
heavy spiritual magic or something

3160.88 --> 3168.079
i don't know i wonder sometimes

3165.04 --> 3168.079
if i have done that

3169.119 --> 3172.319
i've had such compounded experience in

3171.92 --> 3176.079
the

3172.319 --> 3181.359
vision i wouldn't be surprised if

3176.079 --> 3184.88
i have actually done such things but

3181.359 --> 3187.5989999999997
i don't think it would be very blatant

3184.88 --> 3187.599
in your face

3188.16 --> 3195.7599999999998
because during the entire experience i

3189.839 --> 3198.0
was very nervous

3195.76 --> 3198.96
like i potentially probably could have

3198.0 --> 3202.319
done

3198.96 --> 3205.04
bigger things with it

3202.319 --> 3206.4
you could say apply the magic of that

3205.04 --> 3209.839
experience

3206.4 --> 3213.359
but then yeah that would draw in so much

3209.839 --> 3214.16
unwanted attention and that would

3213.359 --> 3217.2799999999997
disrupt

3214.16 --> 3219.2
my peace that i kind of need for what

3217.28 --> 3221.6800000000003
i'm trying to achieve

3219.2 --> 3222.5589999999997
like this purity of insight and higher

3221.68 --> 3226.16
understanding

3222.559 --> 3229.2000000000003
see so i just couldn't do it i could not

3226.16 --> 3229.2
do anything really

3229.52 --> 3235.599
could do things but not

3233.52 --> 3238.559
really things that would have a bigger

3235.599 --> 3241.3590000000004
impact on the world

3238.559 --> 3243.0400000000004
right so that's vision experience right

3241.359 --> 3246.4
i

3243.04 --> 3249.68
proof proof you say no

3246.4 --> 3250.319
absolutely none you could just take this

3249.68 --> 3253.52
as a

3250.319 --> 3255.119
yeah a make-believe situation a giant

3253.52 --> 3256.24
hallucination oh yeah you could

3255.119 --> 3258.7200000000003
definitely take it

3256.24 --> 3258.72
like that

3262.839 --> 3268.72
but

3265.359 --> 3268.72
it might be possible

3269.68 --> 3273.2
and there might be people that are

3271.28 --> 3275.599
actually just doing it with the

3273.2 --> 3276.839
consequences and maybe that is also the

3275.599 --> 3279.839
warning of

3276.839 --> 3282.0
magic

3279.839 --> 3283.839
like if you do so even if you do really

3282.0 --> 3287.119
good things

3283.839 --> 3290.88
then the other

3287.119 --> 3293.52
yeah the other side balances it out

3290.88 --> 3294.88
you can't never just apply something

3293.52 --> 3297.44
magically

3294.88 --> 3298.88
in a way that you just got that and

3297.44 --> 3300.4
nothing else

3298.88 --> 3303.6800000000003
no there will always be a counter

3300.4 --> 3305.6800000000003
response and maybe that is the warning

3303.68 --> 3307.5989999999997
why you shouldn't use sorcery and all

3305.68 --> 3310.5589999999997
that

3307.599 --> 3321.839
if you're gonna believe in spiritual

3310.559 --> 3321.8390000000004
magical application like that

3324.559 --> 3328.4
right so there you go my case for time

3327.52 --> 3332.799
travel

3328.4 --> 3336.2400000000002
in ways yeah a technology time machine

3332.799 --> 3339.7599999999998
i highly highly doubt it

3336.24 --> 3343.2
but maybe through spiritual

3339.76 --> 3345.76
experiences which is like very

3343.2 --> 3345.7599999999998
bizarre

3347.68 --> 3352.64
maybe yeah you could sort of time travel

3352.96 --> 3355.52
i don't know

3361.04 --> 3364.48
i don't know for sure at least

3373.76 --> 3379.28
yeah although what i do know with

3375.68 --> 3379.2799999999997
certainty is that you can dream

3379.44 --> 3384.4
and or yeah have experiences that take

3382.559 --> 3391.52
things from the future as well as the

3384.4 --> 3394.319
past everybody knows that

3391.52 --> 3394.559
speaking of time what is your two year

3394.319 --> 3397.92
and

3394.559 --> 3399.13
five year plan for life career oh i got

3397.92 --> 3402.3
plenty of plans

3399.13 --> 3402.3
[Music]

3403.76 --> 3407.119
or at least yeah well it's not too

3406.079 --> 3410.1600000000003
extensive but

3407.119 --> 3412.2400000000002
yeah i'm doing good my plan is to

3410.16 --> 3418.0789999999997
basically

3412.24 --> 3422.16
uh upgrade a lot of things

3418.079 --> 3422.1600000000003
that have been wearing out right

3422.24 --> 3425.68
like getting new shoes for example would

3424.559 --> 3429.2000000000003
be great

3425.68 --> 3430.0
and actually new pants that will last

3429.2 --> 3432.96
and not just

3430.0 --> 3434.72
get worn out in two years or in half a

3432.96 --> 3436.64
year even like the last time i tried

3434.72 --> 3440.0789999999997
that

3436.64 --> 3441.359
so yeah i've got plenty of things that

3440.079 --> 3444.6400000000003
are running

3441.359 --> 3446.319
i've got the show of course still

3444.64 --> 3447.92
discussing about flat earth

3446.319 --> 3450.079
and i will keep on doing it and i'm

3447.92 --> 3451.92
still learning a lot and i'm even trying

3450.079 --> 3455.28
out new things i'm

3451.92 --> 3457.04
trying out some baller schemes actually

3455.28 --> 3458.4
fooling around with the bending of space

3457.04 --> 3461.119
time because

3458.4 --> 3462.319
yeah it's it's like this piece of clay

3461.119 --> 3464.319
in virtual space

3462.319 --> 3466.16
and everybody nobody seems to be doing

3464.319 --> 3468.0
anything with it it's like wow

3466.16 --> 3470.72
it's all this clay you can play around

3468.0 --> 3474.0
with why wouldn't you

3470.72 --> 3475.68
so yeah i'm getting uh

3474.0 --> 3478.0
einstein i'm getting creative

3475.68 --> 3481.68
einsteinian level

3478.0 --> 3483.92
and it's funny i think although i

3481.68 --> 3486.16
wonder i hope the impact is not going to

3483.92 --> 3489.2000000000003
be too negative on

3486.16 --> 3490.799
the scene i bet

3489.2 --> 3492.8799999999997
there will be flat earthers again that

3490.799 --> 3495.28
are gonna call me a baller

3492.88 --> 3497.52
i bet because it hasn't been the first

3495.28 --> 3497.52
time

3497.599 --> 3502.319
like when i was first doing the flat

3500.4 --> 3505.52
earth talks with the dual cosmogonical

3502.319 --> 3507.68
society i had flat earthers

3505.52 --> 3509.92
in chat they were telling me uh you're a

3507.68 --> 3511.7599999999998
secretly a baller

3509.92 --> 3513.52
you're a shield for the ball and you're

3511.76 --> 3515.3590000000004
just pretending to be a flat earther and

3513.52 --> 3517.44
you still have

3515.359 --> 3521.2799999999997
baller trolls that tell me oh you don't

3517.44 --> 3521.28
really believe in the flat earth

3522.4 --> 3532.799
never stops

3530.0 --> 3535.76
yeah but my plan is to basically upgrade

3532.799 --> 3539.04
my situation

3535.76 --> 3542.2400000000002
now that i feel satisfied that i are

3539.04 --> 3544.319
that i am more responsible that i can

3542.24 --> 3547.359
actually handle this

3544.319 --> 3550.5589999999997
i feel ready to expand and

3547.359 --> 3553.04
i'm slowly still though you know it's

3550.559 --> 3555.0400000000004
always been a big lesson like once my

3553.04 --> 3558.319
mind is ready it's always like yeah

3555.04 --> 3560.16
now bang i'll take on everything

3558.319 --> 3562.48
and then suddenly i collapse under the

3560.16 --> 3566.16
weight right so i've learned the lessons

3562.48 --> 3567.52
grow slowly but i do feel like i'm at

3566.16 --> 3571.359
this

3567.52 --> 3575.04
nexus point where i just got

3571.359 --> 3578.16
a lot of room for newly

3575.04 --> 3581.04
developed skills that i see

3578.16 --> 3582.0789999999997
and that i kind of feel like i wish i

3581.04 --> 3584.88
could test it more

3582.079 --> 3588.079
i'm getting sort of bored that's why i'm

3584.88 --> 3591.76
doing this weird einsteinian thing now

3588.079 --> 3593.52
right literally because yeah the ballers

3591.76 --> 3594.88
are

3593.52 --> 3597.119
they they are they're they're just a

3594.88 --> 3599.599
bunch of bushels now i'm this big tree

3597.119 --> 3601.28
in these bushels they yeah they

3599.599 --> 3603.76
they can't reach my branches anymore

3601.28 --> 3607.76
there's no more challenge

3603.76 --> 3607.76
so okay i guess i'll have to

3608.16 --> 3615.839
do it myself

3615.92 --> 3621.2000000000003
am i afraid of getting too big popular

3619.119 --> 3623.04
becoming a target of the controllers

3621.2 --> 3626.839
it's already too late

3623.04 --> 3629.839
steamy traveler i'm already way too

3626.839 --> 3629.839
popular

3631.44 --> 3637.119
no no

3634.96 --> 3638.7200000000003
it's just the way that i am and the

3637.119 --> 3643.119
things that i've showed off myself

3638.72 --> 3646.3999999999996
the consistency of my frequency of

3643.119 --> 3649.2000000000003
really being me like uncensored in

3646.4 --> 3649.839
very inconvenient ways these i've shown

3649.2 --> 3652.0
things that

3649.839 --> 3654.72
literally nobody ever wants to show of

3652.0 --> 3657.52
themselves and i did it anyway

3654.72 --> 3658.5589999999997
because of the i want it to be full

3657.52 --> 3661.359
spectrum

3658.559 --> 3662.88
not a pretend full spectrum but for real

3661.359 --> 3664.799
even the things that i don't

3662.88 --> 3667.04
really know what to do with them i shown

3664.799 --> 3667.04
them

3667.76 --> 3675.2000000000003
right to get a full spectrum and

3671.44 --> 3675.2000000000003
because i've done that i think that

3675.92 --> 3682.48
i've become unattainable in ways

3679.44 --> 3686.16
and it's weird because i

3682.48 --> 3687.2
they do seem to try to like screw around

3686.16 --> 3690.3999999999996
with me a little

3687.2 --> 3693.5989999999997
and like keep me small they never

3690.4 --> 3695.6800000000003
really targeted me never still i never

3693.599 --> 3698.319
had a strike or anything

3695.68 --> 3700.24
that's really odd with how far that i've

3698.319 --> 3703.44
gone

3700.24 --> 3706.319
yeah with the show and everything

3703.44 --> 3708.0
as for becoming too yeah too big it's

3706.319 --> 3709.44
never gonna happen probably

3708.0 --> 3711.76
although i don't know maybe they'll

3709.44 --> 3712.16
unleash the clamp at some point and i

3711.76 --> 3715.3590000000004
will

3712.16 --> 3716.72
i don't know how that works it might

3715.359 --> 3719.44
happen

3716.72 --> 3721.0389999999998
but i don't think i'm that popular

3719.44 --> 3724.4
because

3721.039 --> 3728.48
i'm very open and forward about

3724.4 --> 3732.2400000000002
flying uh finding stupidity annoying

3728.48 --> 3734.72
and so i ruffle a lot of yeah i hurt

3732.24 --> 3736.5589999999997
feelings of people that don't really

3734.72 --> 3740.16
know how to deal with that

3736.559 --> 3743.3590000000004
it's kind of stupid that way it's just

3740.16 --> 3745.7599999999998
i am that way and i'm very sorry about

3743.359 --> 3750.48
that it's nothing i can do

3745.76 --> 3750.48
sometimes i just don't have the patience

3750.72 --> 3756.64
but in a way i do understand it's just

3754.079 --> 3759.2000000000003
a nuisance in the world don't take it

3756.64 --> 3759.2
personal

3760.24 --> 3765.839
because there are just dumb people

3763.359 --> 3767.7599999999998
and they don't know what to do about it

3765.839 --> 3770.72
and even if you gave them advice

3767.76 --> 3772.559
they wouldn't understand it they just

3770.72 --> 3774.72
can't figure out what you're actually

3772.559 --> 3778.799
saying

3774.72 --> 3778.799
so it's it's more tragic that way

3779.74 --> 3784.709
[Music]

3788.4 --> 3793.28
but yeah i don't mind getting bigger i

3791.28 --> 3794.3190000000004
think that i'm already pretty widely

3793.28 --> 3796.1600000000003
known

3794.319 --> 3798.799
it's just a lot of people that choose

3796.16 --> 3801.2
not to engage probably because

3798.799 --> 3802.88
i am so straightforward and very heavy

3801.2 --> 3806.319
energy sometimes

3802.88 --> 3809.359
it it's kind of dangerous

3806.319 --> 3810.0
it's like a high tension situation for a

3809.359 --> 3811.359
lot of people

3810.0 --> 3813.44
that aren't used to that and they're

3811.359 --> 3819.359
just afraid they might get shocked

3813.44 --> 3819.359
by accident right and i totally get that

3820.799 --> 3829.92
because i'm not a typical very flexible

3824.24 --> 3829.9199999999996
easy easily identifiable

3830.319 --> 3833.359
go around yeah get around to go around

3832.88 --> 3836.0
whatever

3833.359 --> 3836.96
how do you say that guy i'm not like

3836.0 --> 3840.64
that

3836.96 --> 3843.76
at all i'm very

3840.64 --> 3846.4
pinned down character that is an

3843.76 --> 3846.4
individual

3846.799 --> 3852.4
and in ways not very well understood

3850.4 --> 3855.6800000000003
or predictable talking about weird

3852.4 --> 3860.079
subjects so yeah it's like

3855.68 --> 3862.3999999999996
unnerving to try and approach i get that

3860.079 --> 3864.2400000000002
and there's even people that feel that

3862.4 --> 3867.359
tension and then like

3864.24 --> 3870.0
exciting like a troll going up

3867.359 --> 3873.52
oh let's let's try to get in the gates

3870.0 --> 3875.2
and then yeah they get zapped

3873.52 --> 3877.2
but it's like an adventure to these

3875.2 --> 3880.72
trolls sometimes and that's why i think

3877.2 --> 3882.5589999999997
that they do keep coming

3880.72 --> 3895.839
they just gotta try it out see if they

3882.559 --> 3895.8390000000004
can sneak in

3895.92 --> 3901.28
right but i think i am correct about

3897.92 --> 3903.119
this i am kind of a high tension guy

3901.28 --> 3904.4
and that just makes a lot of people

3903.119 --> 3907.28
nervous

3904.4 --> 3908.079
so i'm not that easily approachable

3907.28 --> 3911.52
compared to

3908.079 --> 3912.7200000000003
a lot of other people that typically

3911.52 --> 3915.7599999999998
present themselves

3912.72 --> 3915.7599999999998
as such

3917.28 --> 3923.039
they try to adapt a little more and i

3920.64 --> 3925.2
i don't really i do in a way because i

3923.039 --> 3928.079
have to you know because it's

3925.2 --> 3928.0789999999997
otherwise it's just

3929.599 --> 3941.28
it's not gonna run as smooth otherwise

3937.68 --> 3941.2799999999997
it has to be limit somehow

3944.24 --> 3951.839
hey uh how much done stone good to see

3946.559 --> 3951.8390000000004
you and pumpkin

3955.039 --> 3965.119
no god no dutch sailor there's no

3959.359 --> 3970.0789999999997
infinite flat earth

3965.119 --> 3970.079
you can't wish for paradoxical

3976.839 --> 3979.839
situations

3990.839 --> 3993.839
okay

4002.72 --> 4007.839
globe guilt

4012.11 --> 4015.26
[Music]

4018.839 --> 4021.839
hmm

4045.68 --> 4053.44
who knows

4048.799 --> 4053.44
i'll take whatever the designer

4054.4 --> 4059.599
gave us you know when it comes to how

4057.44 --> 4062.16
big this realm is

4059.599 --> 4063.52
technically i'm already satisfied with

4062.16 --> 4067.92
very little surface

4063.52 --> 4071.7599999999998
although i'm glad that more exists

4067.92 --> 4075.28
but who knows it may be just this

4071.76 --> 4076.88
just this and antarctica or whatever

4075.28 --> 4080.4
that is exactly

4076.88 --> 4083.6800000000003
that and that's it or maybe

4080.4 --> 4085.44
yeah maybe there is like another entire

4083.68 --> 4088.5589999999997
realm to the north in a realm to the

4085.44 --> 4088.559
south as big as this

4088.799 --> 4095.599
or maybe there's 32

4092.4 --> 4096.159
more realm segments interconnected like

4095.599 --> 4101.92
a big

4096.159 --> 4101.92
ring north and south who knows

4102.96 --> 4119.839
it's only one way to figure that out

4126.799 --> 4133.04
more puddles oh god no not more puddles

4129.679 --> 4136.159
don't call it a puddle

4133.04 --> 4136.159
that's not gonna happen

4139.04 --> 4143.359
it's not a puddle in a big plane in a

4142.239 --> 4146.08
big ice

4143.359 --> 4148.0
like a big ice square or whatever with

4146.08 --> 4152.08
puddles in there no

4148.0 --> 4152.08
no that's already disc reification

4153.92 --> 4158.839
it's going to be north and south so it's

4155.759 --> 4163.44
it would be more like we're on a giant

4158.839 --> 4163.44
ring and every piece of the ring

4163.52 --> 4170.0
is an east to west loop realm segment

4167.279 --> 4171.679
and it connects and then yeah you could

4170.0 --> 4172.319
virtually connect the north yeah it

4171.679 --> 4174.319
could be that

4172.319 --> 4176.88
if you go north long enough you'll end

4174.319 --> 4176.88
up south

4183.199 --> 4189.839
forgotten realms

4194.64 --> 4199.1990000000005
yeah who knows you know forgotten realms

4198.0 --> 4201.6
is like a d and d

4199.199 --> 4204.32
realm right in the dungeon dragons the

4201.6 --> 4207.4400000000005
forgotten realms is like

4204.32 --> 4210.719
catch name for their specific map

4207.44 --> 4214.799999999999
design which

4210.719 --> 4216.64
yeah all of the games and stories

4214.8 --> 4218.8
take place in that realm it's very

4216.64 --> 4220.400000000001
specific

4218.8 --> 4222.400000000001
but the history baldur's gate takes

4220.4 --> 4226.5599999999995
place in in the forgotten realms

4222.4 --> 4226.5599999999995
anyway so

4227.679 --> 4231.679
but yeah who knows what's north and

4230.8 --> 4235.04
south

4231.679 --> 4237.84
it might be barriers it might

4235.04 --> 4239.36
not be barriers might never find the

4237.84 --> 4242.64
barriers or maybe there are like

4239.36 --> 4245.759999999999
pillars here and there and just more

4242.64 --> 4247.679
access further and then when you go to

4245.76 --> 4250.159000000001
the other side of that realm

4247.679 --> 4251.28
there's more pillars and more access to

4250.159 --> 4259.839999999999
more realms

4251.28 --> 4259.84
or a barrier i don't know

4265.76 --> 4270.320000000001
the golden compass movie never heard of

4270.84 --> 4273.84
that

4278.17 --> 4281.289
[Music]

4283.63 --> 4289.06
[Music]

4298.84 --> 4301.84
hmm

4302.64 --> 4306.0
how do you know other suns and moons

4304.96 --> 4309.28
well

4306.0 --> 4311.199
other you mean the sun and the moon are

4309.28 --> 4313.36
objects you say

4311.199 --> 4315.44
or they're just part of the celestial

4313.36 --> 4318.0
light

4315.44 --> 4318.48
it's going there is no moon there is no

4318.0 --> 4321.6
sun

4318.48 --> 4324.5599999999995
it's just it an apparent sun

4321.6 --> 4324.56
and a parrot moon

4325.52 --> 4329.92
it's the book i asked you to read robert

4327.92 --> 4333.36
pullman

4329.92 --> 4338.719
oh well i didn't read it

4333.36 --> 4338.719
it's dark materials that does sound

4340.84 --> 4343.84
familiar

4348.719 --> 4352.719
oh yeah by the way that was kind of

4350.4 --> 4352.719
weird

4352.8 --> 4357.28
like i was watching robert jeff here

4355.84 --> 4360.719
yesterday who had a

4357.28 --> 4363.92
a premium yeah premiere

4360.719 --> 4368.32
and he talks yeah he's into like uh

4363.92 --> 4371.84
ruins and all that ruins uh

4368.32 --> 4374.08
antiqua attack and all that

4371.84 --> 4376.0
no not like that it's it's into

4374.08 --> 4378.88
archaeology

4376.0 --> 4380.8
and yeah they call that the ancient

4378.88 --> 4382.400000000001
monolithic structures right

4380.8 --> 4384.0
so it does a lot of video and

4382.4 --> 4386.96
presentations but yesterday

4384.0 --> 4386.96
he went all in

4387.36 --> 4393.759999999999
about secret space programs and all that

4390.0 --> 4396.64
that was really weird to sit there

4393.76 --> 4397.12
listen to that that old stuff that i

4396.64 --> 4401.4400000000005
would have

4397.12 --> 4403.04
like totally bought into 20 years ago

4401.44 --> 4407.759999999999
that would have been very fascinating

4403.04 --> 4407.76
for me but now it's just like what

4408.32 --> 4416.32
so i inserted some basic scientific

4412.0 --> 4418.719
details situations

4416.32 --> 4421.44
so not uh because he's probably not a

4418.719 --> 4424.4
flat earther

4421.44 --> 4424.4
i don't think he is

4425.04 --> 4429.44
but he doesn't seem to be like anti-flat

4427.92 --> 4432.8
earther either

4429.44 --> 4434.239
it's weird but yeah i don't know i'm

4432.8 --> 4441.84
subscribed to this guy i don't know if

4434.239 --> 4441.839999999999
anybody's ever seen that

4452.32 --> 4457.759999999999
video game developer okay that sounds

4455.199 --> 4457.759999999999
interesting

4460.0 --> 4467.6
yeah but how that usually works is

4463.76 --> 4470.64
you just yeah set up a story or whatever

4467.6 --> 4472.88
an idea mechanics

4470.64 --> 4474.4800000000005
the bigger developers bigger game

4472.88 --> 4476.719
developers i don't really

4474.48 --> 4482.718999999999
trust that too much because you're

4476.719 --> 4485.28
basically just handing it over

4482.719 --> 4485.28
i don't know

4492.0 --> 4496.0
besides at this point i don't really

4494.0 --> 4501.36
have any concrete ideas

4496.0 --> 4501.36
i just had older blueprints as it were

4504.239 --> 4508.32
but i don't really have like a business

4506.32 --> 4512.08
plan for a game with that

4508.32 --> 4516.08
like that still very much in just

4512.08 --> 4519.44
experimental stages with these games

4516.08 --> 4525.84
or these game ideas

4519.44 --> 4525.839999999999
i don't know

4545.12 --> 4549.92
but anyway yeah thank you steamy

4546.64 --> 4549.92
traveler that that is

4550.84 --> 4555.1990000000005
interesting that's an interesting

4553.52 --> 4556.88
suggestion

4555.199 --> 4559.759999999999
i've thought about that many times

4556.88 --> 4559.76
before but it's just

4563.679 --> 4567.84
i don't really know where to start

4569.92 --> 4575.1990000000005
i'm st like i still have a story

4572.96 --> 4576.8
based on the the game that i've been

4575.199 --> 4580.879999999999
doing with my last

4576.8 --> 4582.96
player group and i'm still having to

4580.88 --> 4584.08
work that all out i never yeah i've kind

4582.96 --> 4586.08
of let that

4584.08 --> 4587.76
hang around for a long time but i still

4586.08 --> 4589.84
have all the notes

4587.76 --> 4592.56
to just see what kind of a story i can

4589.84 --> 4592.56
make out of that

4592.88 --> 4596.159000000001
like as a re reading story and then just

4595.44 --> 4599.04
see

4596.159 --> 4600.239
what is this is this a viable natural

4599.04 --> 4602.0
developed story

4600.239 --> 4605.839999999999
with some weird elements in it it

4602.0 --> 4605.84
definitely has some weird things in it

4606.0 --> 4610.56
there's like morally dubious behavior in

4608.8 --> 4613.76
ways

4610.56 --> 4616.88
but it is i try to

4613.76 --> 4617.6
keep the logos in there and just not let

4616.88 --> 4621.04
bad things

4617.6 --> 4624.719
slide like let it have an impact

4621.04 --> 4626.56
so yeah we'll see if it is

4624.719 --> 4628.719
once i get that sort of ready and then

4626.56 --> 4630.56
know what what it is

4628.719 --> 4633.04
who knows what you can do with that i

4630.56 --> 4635.280000000001
could actually like turn it into a video

4633.04 --> 4636.96
game i still have all the development

4635.28 --> 4641.36
blueprints

4636.96 --> 4644.32
have having a giant multi-branch rpg

4641.36 --> 4645.5199999999995
game but i'll do it all style not the

4644.32 --> 4649.28
freaking 3d

4645.52 --> 4649.280000000001
nonsense but just

4649.679 --> 4652.96
keep it basic keep it quick keep it

4652.4 --> 4657.44
fluid

4652.96 --> 4662.88
no more nonsense convoluted graphics

4657.44 --> 4666.4
and all that it's just nobody needs that

4662.88 --> 4666.400000000001
or i don't need it i don't want it

4670.56 --> 4673.84
just have good artwork and leave it to

4673.199 --> 4678.48
that

4673.84 --> 4680.0
all this interactive 3d [ __ ] it's just

4678.48 --> 4682.799999999999
yeah it didn't really work out for

4680.0 --> 4685.28
baldur's gate 3 so far

4682.8 --> 4687.12
it's still in development but it's just

4685.28 --> 4689.36
ugh

4687.12 --> 4690.88
i barely play that anymore because yeah

4689.36 --> 4707.839999999999
the graphics it's just

4690.88 --> 4707.84
slowing it down terribly

4711.96 --> 4715.02
[Music]

4718.84 --> 4721.84
kids

4732.84 --> 4735.84
cool

4736.4 --> 4739.199
yeah that's great

4741.04 --> 4744.4
well i'll be looking forward to that but

4743.199 --> 4748.08
it's not going to be

4744.4 --> 4750.96
there for some time i don't have any

4748.08 --> 4751.92
great plan at the moment i'm still just

4750.96 --> 4753.84
doing this

4751.92 --> 4755.76
and i'm more concerned with getting

4753.84 --> 4759.28
better living

4755.76 --> 4762.719
situations and then

4759.28 --> 4763.759999999999
which will probably happen in the course

4762.719 --> 4766.4
of the next year

4763.76 --> 4767.76
or maybe after because it is slowly

4766.4 --> 4770.799999999999
growing

4767.76 --> 4773.92
a better foundation financially

4770.8 --> 4776.320000000001
and yeah

4773.92 --> 4777.12
we'll see once i get a better place i

4776.32 --> 4779.599999999999
can do

4777.12 --> 4783.679
all kinds of things i can do potentially

4779.6 --> 4783.679
gardening i could do goldsmithing again

4784.4 --> 4791.28
maybe yeah go on dates again who knows

4787.6 --> 4794.159000000001
because i actually have a decent place

4791.28 --> 4796.4
to present i don't know i'm just like

4794.159 --> 4796.4
that

4797.199 --> 4801.199
and then maybe i'll yeah i'll actually

4800.0 --> 4803.36
start

4801.199 --> 4804.32
getting into game development a little

4803.36 --> 4807.12
more serious

4804.32 --> 4819.84
if i still have the time for that i

4807.12 --> 4819.84
don't know we'll see

4850.239 --> 4852.5599999999995
huh

4853.52 --> 4861.84
oh i remember since that what who is

4856.8 --> 4861.84
arthur morgan

4874.8 --> 4877.04
no

4879.36 --> 4882.639
it's a voice actor

4887.12 --> 4891.04
oh wait roger clark

4891.92 --> 4894.159
what

4895.52 --> 4900.8
no it's probably not what we're talking

4898.48 --> 4900.799999999999
about

4901.28 --> 4903.84
what

4916.159 --> 4922.5599999999995
okay i don't fully understand why you

4918.32 --> 4922.5599999999995
said that a reminiscent stone is that

4923.36 --> 4930.32
i don't know who arthur morgan is

4926.56 --> 4933.52
my google search was confusing

4930.32 --> 4933.5199999999995
is it somebody you know

4942.84 --> 4947.84
rdr2

4945.6 --> 4947.84
what

4952.639 --> 4960.2390000000005
hello is anybody still out there

4958.32 --> 4972.32
what are you guys all doing you're all

4960.239 --> 4977.759999999999
doing something else aren't you

4972.32 --> 4977.759999999999
well i'm not super talkative so i get it

4978.32 --> 4987.679
a character in a game

4981.52 --> 4990.719
what okay

4987.679 --> 4993.92
right in red that redemption

4990.719 --> 4997.84
that's what i caught from it

4993.92 --> 4997.84
okay i i

4998.0 --> 5001.84
i've never even played that game so

5008.0 --> 5014.239
i've seen some reviews about it though

5011.52 --> 5029.84
that's a long time ago it's a very

5014.239 --> 5029.839999999999
popular game i guess

5030.32 --> 5043.84
thank you

5059.28 --> 5062.159
right uh

5063.44 --> 5068.32
yeah this is getting really boring guys

5065.84 --> 5068.32
come on

5068.639 --> 5073.52
i don't really know what to talk about

5070.8 --> 5073.52
at this moment

5080.4 --> 5085.839999999999
high level what is a high level expert

5086.08 --> 5094.96
satellite company operators

5089.679 --> 5099.84
which who who is operating it

5094.96 --> 5099.84
rocket scientists

5103.679 --> 5110.08
well for

5106.719 --> 5115.04
yeah why would they there

5110.08 --> 5115.04
they probably signed contracts not to do

5124.84 --> 5127.84
that

5135.76 --> 5142.639
i think that as long as nobody's being

5139.6 --> 5154.719
directly hurt by it that they're uh

5142.639 --> 5158.2390000000005
well maybe they would i don't know man

5154.719 --> 5158.2390000000005
i i don't know

5165.44 --> 5169.919999999999
maybe the people that do that don't want

5167.84 --> 5171.76
it to end

5169.92 --> 5175.04
maybe they're just making money from it

5171.76 --> 5175.04
and they're all fine with it

5177.12 --> 5183.84
they don't want to go through the hassle

5178.8 --> 5183.84
i don't know why

5198.159 --> 5211.839999999999
well he really said that george sanford

5201.28 --> 5211.84
did michio kaku santa

5213.28 --> 5216.5599999999995
the biggest mismatch in scientific

5216.0 --> 5219.6
research

5216.56 --> 5223.280000000001
cosmology and reality

5219.6 --> 5224.88
right so yeah thank you for

5223.28 --> 5226.5599999999995
bringing that up i didn't even know he

5224.88 --> 5228.88
had said that

5226.56 --> 5229.6
but there you go isn't that like a

5228.88 --> 5238.639
high-level

5229.6 --> 5241.6
expert coming out against heliocentrism

5238.639 --> 5243.1990000000005
what if they came out and you didn't

5241.6 --> 5245.4400000000005
even notice it

5243.199 --> 5246.5599999999995
that they were basically conveying that

5245.44 --> 5248.48
message

5246.56 --> 5251.360000000001
what if they came out and you just

5248.48 --> 5254.4
didn't take notice of it

5251.36 --> 5257.36
nathan yamaha

5254.4 --> 5257.36
465.

5257.92 --> 5267.84
oh wow you dug up the video even thanks

5259.84 --> 5267.84
for that cool

5296.8 --> 5302.719
right so why would they

5300.239 --> 5302.718999999999
come out

5304.08 --> 5309.84
why are you expecting them to come out

5325.36 --> 5329.679
we should expect honesty really

5329.84 --> 5337.84
based on what of the giant amount of

5333.36 --> 5337.839999999999
money they get

5362.84 --> 5365.84
huh

5373.72 --> 5378.299
[Music]

5380.56 --> 5384.2390000000005
but seriously it's a question i think

5383.36 --> 5387.28
yeah

5384.239 --> 5387.28
to misunderstand

5387.679 --> 5390.88
should you expect honesty from somebody

5390.32 --> 5394.08
that

5390.88 --> 5398.88
when they signed on knew

5394.08 --> 5400.8
that they were part of upholding lies

5398.88 --> 5402.2390000000005
then why would you expect honesty of

5400.8 --> 5404.84
such people

5402.239 --> 5407.839999999999
when they knew what they were getting

5404.84 --> 5407.84
into

5450.48 --> 5457.959999999999
well that may account for the original

5454.32 --> 5462.719
astronauts nathan yamaha

5457.96 --> 5466.88
465 but yeah they later astronauts

5462.719 --> 5466.88
the actors no

5466.96 --> 5470.08
they weren't ignorant they knew they

5469.12 --> 5473.12
were actors

5470.08 --> 5473.12
playing this play

5474.239 --> 5477.839999999999
it's blatantly obvious

5478.639 --> 5482.159000000001
they're engaging in trickery and they

5480.719 --> 5484.56
must know that

5482.159 --> 5486.0
they can't you can't fool yourself that

5484.56 --> 5491.84
that's not happening

5486.0 --> 5491.84
when you're in the middle of doing that

5503.28 --> 5508.239
don pettit knows yeah

5508.56 --> 5514.080000000001
if he can muster the focus for his

5511.52 --> 5516.84
consciousness to realize what's going on

5514.08 --> 5518.8
maybe i don't know i think he's really

5516.84 --> 5520.639
dumb

5518.8 --> 5522.96
not too sure but everything i've seen

5520.639 --> 5526.400000000001
from him so far is just like

5522.96 --> 5528.4
i don't know he might be a stellar actor

5526.4 --> 5530.96
and that he's actually brilliant and can

5528.4 --> 5532.4
act out like this incredibly stupid

5530.96 --> 5536.56
handicapped level

5532.4 --> 5538.159
person but i've been told that he really

5536.56 --> 5540.4800000000005
is that

5538.159 --> 5542.799999999999
and in that case he it might just slip

5540.48 --> 5545.12
him by

5542.8 --> 5546.159000000001
he can yeah he's just going to believe

5545.12 --> 5549.28
and maybe he

5546.159 --> 5551.199
knew it was tricking but it's just it

5549.28 --> 5552.239
becomes so convoluted to him that he

5551.199 --> 5554.799999999999
just forgets

5552.239 --> 5557.28
or something i don't know but i don't

5554.8 --> 5557.28
it's so

5558.159 --> 5561.839999999999
it's so bad

5562.48 --> 5565.5199999999995
but unless he can hide it from his own

5564.4 --> 5575.759999999999
consciousness yes

5565.52 --> 5579.52
don pettit damn well knows

5575.76 --> 5579.52
the evil mastermind

5582.96 --> 5589.84
that's just silly

5610.22 --> 5613.379

[Music]

5628.88 --> 5632.96
oh wow jeff williams

5636.32 --> 5639.44
he said i get it

5642.84 --> 5647.1990000000005
right

5644.8 --> 5648.159000000001
what i don't know who jeff williams is

5647.199 --> 5650.799999999999
by the way

5648.159 --> 5652.0
like does he engage in the trickery with

5650.8 --> 5655.12
nasa

5652.0 --> 5655.12
i don't know who is this

5656.719 --> 5660.32
is he of nasa

5665.12 --> 5673.84
allegedly been on the iss

5684.84 --> 5687.84
okay

5688.35 --> 5691.529
[Music]

5730.8 --> 5738.2390000000005
all right yeah i agree here we go again

5734.639 --> 5738.2390000000005
nathan yamaha

5740.84 --> 5757.28
what

5743.44 --> 5759.5199999999995
that is fascinating

5757.28 --> 5761.84
because maybe he thinks he needs to be

5759.52 --> 5764.400000000001
part in this trickery for the betterment

5761.84 --> 5764.400000000001

[Music]

5810.84 --> 5813.84
hmm

5818.32 --> 5827.84
hey guns have never owned rmp good to

5821.199 --> 5827.839999999999
see you too

5852.84 --> 5855.84
but

5894.84 --> 5899.84
hmm

5896.08 --> 5899.84
yeah well that's the problem

5901.199 --> 5904.879999999999
you gotta really like you can hear

5904.239 --> 5908.08
people

5904.88 --> 5909.679
telling you or making a claim that

5908.08 --> 5911.76
something happened

5909.679 --> 5914.0
and then take it for granted but unless

5911.76 --> 5915.6
you've seen some more tangible evidence

5914.0 --> 5920.159
for that actually happening

5915.6 --> 5925.84
the person doing it on

5920.159 --> 5925.839999999999
on camera or whatever yeah then

5926.239 --> 5930.4
there's all kinds of nonsense that can

5928.239 --> 5932.08
slip in and you just by accident assume

5930.4 --> 5934.5599999999995
it's real

5932.08 --> 5936.88
so yeah it's always sensible to ask for

5934.56 --> 5939.52
some original source

5936.88 --> 5941.04
for a claim like that here we go again

5939.52 --> 5943.679
hey zac sterling by the way

5941.04 --> 5943.679
good to see you

5951.04 --> 5956.4
what here we go again don't be

5961.1 --> 5964.169000000001
[Music]

5964.84 --> 5967.84
ridiculous

5978.84 --> 5981.84
hmm

6007.52 --> 6013.360000000001
don't worry about that i'm a little slow

6010.96 --> 6013.36
today

6018.88 --> 6022.0
i still have to do my newspaper rounds

6021.199 --> 6037.839999999999
not looking too

6022.0 --> 6037.84
forward to that oh well

6041.44 --> 6047.759999999999
right guns does not run rmp

6044.96 --> 6048.8
yeah architects don't take into account

6047.76 --> 6052.719
curvature

6048.8 --> 6052.719
for their design indeed

6054.08 --> 6057.28
i am coming down with it yeah i got i

6056.32 --> 6058.799999999999
already i

6057.28 --> 6060.8
announced that at the start of the show

6058.8 --> 6065.76
but i do have sort of a bit of a cold

6060.8 --> 6079.84
it's not really bad

6065.76 --> 6079.84
but a little

6090.84 --> 6095.04
huh

6092.08 --> 6096.5599999999995
yeah it does slow me down a lot it's

6095.04 --> 6099.119
true

6096.56 --> 6101.119000000001
now not that i notice much difference

6099.119 --> 6104.839999999999
it's just that i get a little bit more

6101.119 --> 6106.48
daisy just kind of waiting hanging

6104.84 --> 6110.400000000001
around

6106.48 --> 6111.5199999999995
that's it am i still avoiding alcohol

6110.4 --> 6114.96
well i had

6111.52 --> 6114.96
alcohol two days ago

6115.44 --> 6120.48
i tried it out i explained some about

6117.52 --> 6122.639
this that on this show too

6120.48 --> 6123.839999999999
but yeah that's just too that yeah i

6122.639 --> 6128.2390000000005
don't

6123.84 --> 6132.4800000000005
i got out of it what i wanted to know

6128.239 --> 6134.718999999999
so yeah i don't really

6132.48 --> 6136.159
it's not doing for me what i thought it

6134.719 --> 6138.56
was gonna do

6136.159 --> 6140.48
and um yeah so i'm still just sticking

6138.56 --> 6142.96
to not drinking

6140.48 --> 6145.04
even though two days ago i did but yeah

6142.96 --> 6149.84
i can just do that

6145.04 --> 6149.84
this is

6160.84 --> 6163.84
so

6170.48 --> 6177.839999999999
hmm all right thanks zach sterling

6199.119 --> 6202.48
yeah it's been good having you around

6200.88 --> 6205.84
too zach sterling it's uh

6202.48 --> 6205.839999999999
you're an interesting person

6207.36 --> 6219.839999999999
glad you joined up

6259.119 --> 6263.679
it's just a generally quiet day

6261.92 --> 6266.88
everywhere for everyone

6263.679 --> 6269.679
perhaps or perhaps i'm helping

6266.88 --> 6271.1990000000005
everybody slow down with the way i am i

6269.679 --> 6275.36
don't know

6271.199 --> 6277.839999999999
it's kind of a matter of perspective

6275.36 --> 6279.839999999999
i don't know maybe it is kind of a slow

6277.84 --> 6281.119000000001
day or maybe it is kind of like the

6279.84 --> 6284.88
silence before this

6281.119 --> 6286.0
the new year's storm sort of thing like

6284.88 --> 6288.96
everybody

6286.0 --> 6290.239
is preparing to get to that moment where

6288.96 --> 6293.52
it's going to be

6290.239 --> 6293.5199999999995
new year's eve and all that

6293.679 --> 6299.119
so maybe it's like the silence before

6295.6 --> 6304.320000000001
the storm in that sense a bit

6299.119 --> 6304.32
it's just just two more days

6304.56 --> 6308.719
and then it's 2020 is over

6308.88 --> 6315.36
then we're going to 2021 and it's just

6311.92 --> 6317.4400000000005
happening so quickly now although

6315.36 --> 6320.4
yeah a lot of has happened in this year

6317.44 --> 6320.4
like a whole lot

6326.32 --> 6333.04
and the settings have changed

6330.0 --> 6335.92
and yeah people have been exposed to

6333.04 --> 6335.92
other levels

6336.32 --> 6342.32
so just a lot of things have happened on

6339.679 --> 6345.679
an energy level

6342.32 --> 6347.84
the setting has changed palpably

6345.679 --> 6349.6
and i don't know might be a whole bunch

6347.84 --> 6351.6
of people that don't even remember what

6349.6 --> 6354.2390000000005
it used to be like anymore

6351.6 --> 6354.2390000000005
at this point

6354.96 --> 6358.719
because when things change so

6357.52 --> 6361.280000000001
dramatically

6358.719 --> 6364.719
the subtle things get lost i talked

6361.28 --> 6364.719
about that at the beginning of the show

6370.159 --> 6374.879999999999
what do you think is in store for the fe

6372.4 --> 6377.92
community in 2021

6374.88 --> 6377.92
pretty much the same

6378.08 --> 6381.28
ballers yeah the

6381.6 --> 6385.52
not a lot of ballers they're just gonna

6383.92 --> 6388.8
stick to their own little

6385.52 --> 6392.96
swamps and

6388.8 --> 6392.96
probably the ether war as

6393.52 --> 6398.84
that's gonna happen so there's gonna be

6396.08 --> 6402.32
more flat earther against flat earther

6398.84 --> 6402.32
and like that

6406.719 --> 6415.84
that's gonna continue on and we'll see

6408.8 --> 6415.84
where it goes

6418.4 --> 6423.36
probably grabbler moves

6427.119 --> 6432.799999999999
it's going to be a whole bunch of

6428.32 --> 6432.799999999999
grabbler chess happening out there

6433.44 --> 6443.839999999999
and maybe even within the fe community

6444.08 --> 6457.84
we'll see but yeah it's not going to be

6448.239 --> 6457.839999999999
an eventful let's just say it like that

6482.84 --> 6488.159000000001
eh

6484.96 --> 6491.4
uh nathan yama

6488.159 --> 6495.5199999999995
it's my opinion on

6491.4 --> 6496.5599999999995
incoherent magnetism as a downward force

6495.52 --> 6500.0
yeah

6496.56 --> 6502.8
downwards bias is for the dance

6500.0 --> 6503.32
and any concept that literally has the

6502.8 --> 6507.52
word

6503.32 --> 6509.36
incoherent in it to attribute that to

6507.52 --> 6513.119000000001
something universal

6509.36 --> 6516.08
is just utterly silly to me

6513.119 --> 6518.5599999999995
it's i can't get over that it's just

6516.08 --> 6520.8
funny i just think it's funny

6518.56 --> 6522.92
like how can something that is

6520.8 --> 6525.52
supposedly universal be

6522.92 --> 6527.679
incoherent that's just absolutely

6525.52 --> 6530.4800000000005
preposterous sorry

6527.679 --> 6532.719
and besides magnetism doesn't influence

6530.48 --> 6536.08
air

6532.719 --> 6538.8
doesn't influence gases

6536.08 --> 6540.639
yeah there's a whole lot of issues i

6538.8 --> 6542.96
think it's complete fiction it's a

6540.639 --> 6545.52
desperate last attempt to try and reify

6542.96 --> 6545.52
gravity

6555.679 --> 6561.76
yeah because it's surrounded by

6559.679 --> 6563.4400000000005
well first off they have to actually be

6561.76 --> 6566.719
able to

6563.44 --> 6571.199
not burst in the face of a vacuum right

6566.719 --> 6574.08
and yeah a vacuum is less dense

6571.199 --> 6574.638999999999
than the rubber and the helium trapped

6574.08 --> 6577.119
within

6574.639 --> 6578.8
the rubber that's correct so it'll go

6577.119 --> 6581.44
downward

6578.8 --> 6582.56
because at that point the helium and the

6581.44 --> 6585.598999999999
balloon combined

6582.56 --> 6588.56
are denser than the medium they're in

6585.599 --> 6589.92
that's right so then then they fall down

6588.56 --> 6592.88
because of relative density

6589.92 --> 6596.4800000000005
disequilibrium with the surrounding

6592.88 --> 6598.639
yeah that does not prove a downward bias

6596.48 --> 6600.959999999999
because if it isn't in a vacuum it's

6598.639 --> 6602.4800000000005
going to go up instead because

6600.96 --> 6605.44
it's in this equilibrium with its

6602.48 --> 6608.638999999999
surroundings in the other way

6605.44 --> 6611.839999999999
it's medium it's surrounded by is denser

6608.639 --> 6615.1990000000005
than the helium balloon so

6611.84 --> 6616.32
then it goes up yeah that's how it works

6615.199 --> 6620.32
that's proven

6616.32 --> 6620.32
that scientifically proven fact

6620.88 --> 6624.96
repeatable anyone can do it's very easy

6622.96 --> 6627.44
to do that demonstrate that

6624.96 --> 6629.76
you don't need some laboratory for that

6627.44 --> 6633.44
very easy you can just do it with

6629.76 --> 6636.84
daily materials you can access easily

6633.44 --> 6639.839999999999
demonstrate relative density how it

6636.84 --> 6639.84
works

6641.48 --> 6644.8099999999995
[Music]

6650.79 --> 6654.699
[Music]

6660.88 --> 6667.04
nothing oh there is never nothing

6664.239 --> 6668.799999999999
a perfect vacuum is a fictional concept

6667.04 --> 6671.36
it's impossible it's mathematically

6668.8 --> 6674.719
impossible to have a perfect vacuum

6671.36 --> 6677.5199999999995
for starters right and it doesn't matter

6674.719 --> 6679.44
whether there is something in there or

6677.52 --> 6683.360000000001
there isn't

6679.44 --> 6685.759999999999
of what is in there volumetrically

6683.36 --> 6686.96
the average density will still be

6685.76 --> 6690.56
compared to the

6686.96 --> 6694.4
object its density

6690.56 --> 6698.080000000001
and yeah a vacuum is a lot less dense

6694.4 --> 6701.36
or almost vacuum is a lot less dense

6698.08 --> 6703.04
than that thing so it's definitely going

6701.36 --> 6705.119
to go down because that's where the

6703.04 --> 6710.4
equilibrium this equilibrium

6705.119 --> 6710.4
will send it because it is a lot denser

6714.719 --> 6722.0
no there is no downward bias

6718.88 --> 6725.28
it's the denser

6722.0 --> 6728.32
denser things specifically relative

6725.28 --> 6732.96
to its surrounding denser things go down

6728.32 --> 6737.119
yeah denser things go down go boom boom

6732.96 --> 6741.119
less dense things go up

6737.119 --> 6744.32
that's how it is it's always in relation

6741.119 --> 6746.4
to the medium that's the very specific

6744.32 --> 6748.639
anchor point

6746.4 --> 6749.44
always in relation to the density of the

6748.639 --> 6751.4400000000005
medium that

6749.44 --> 6754.5599999999995
is what relative density is and that's

6751.44 --> 6756.96
the only thing it really is

6754.56 --> 6758.0
and the mechanics that flow from it can

6756.96 --> 6759.76
explain them but

6758.0 --> 6761.84
that is the anchor point it's always

6759.76 --> 6763.84
about the density of the medium versus

6761.84 --> 6766.56
the density of the object that is what

6763.84 --> 6769.76
determines the direction

6766.56 --> 6769.76
the disequilibrium

6773.679 --> 6777.28
yeah that's right downward bias is for

6776.4 --> 6779.839999999999
the dense

6777.28 --> 6779.84
that's correct

6787.679 --> 6794.56
upward bias is for the less dense

6791.119 --> 6794.5599999999995
so there you go that's what it is

6797.119 --> 6804.839999999999
it's not exclusively down there is no

6800.48 --> 6807.839999999999
exclusive downward bias that's a

6804.84 --> 6807.84
reification

6838.8 --> 6842.88
do objects ever move sideways well not

6842.08 --> 6845.599
not because

6842.88 --> 6847.4400000000005
of the passive displacement caused by

6845.599 --> 6849.360000000001
relative density no

6847.44 --> 6851.119
it goes up and down but hey other

6849.36 --> 6854.5599999999995
factors might play

6851.119 --> 6857.0
there might be a inflexible

6854.56 --> 6859.119000000001
resistance that will cause the

6857.0 --> 6862.32
disequilibrium to basically

6859.119 --> 6863.5199999999995
evade like rolling down a hill makes it

6862.32 --> 6866.32
go

6863.52 --> 6866.320000000001
diagonal

6867.44 --> 6873.44
and liquids in this equilibrium with the

6870.88 --> 6875.76
surrounding air will

6873.44 --> 6878.239
fall down and try to spread around

6875.76 --> 6878.2390000000005
equally

6878.56 --> 6884.4800000000005
in a horizontal fashion until yeah

6881.84 --> 6886.8
it averages out and it becomes at

6884.48 --> 6889.44
equilibrium with everything

6886.8 --> 6890.2390000000005
with itself and the error is all

6889.44 --> 6894.48
displaced

6890.239 --> 6897.119
to above it because it is less dense

6894.48 --> 6905.839999999999
than the medium of water it was in when

6897.119 --> 6905.839999999999
the water came in there

6913.56 --> 6919.84
antipodal is true what does that mean

6920.88 --> 6927.28
no universal down well that's a matter

6924.08 --> 6930.88
of opinion really but if when you go to

6927.28 --> 6932.96
scientific factual

6930.88 --> 6934.400000000001
wording of things then no there is no

6932.96 --> 6937.679
universal down

6934.4 --> 6941.28
down is relative but

6937.679 --> 6943.84
as you go for colloquially yeah

6941.28 --> 6947.84
sure there's a universal down and

6943.84 --> 6947.84
there's a universal up

6948.4 --> 6961.839999999999
but yeah i'm not gonna lay any

6949.92 --> 6961.84
scientific claims to that

6963.04 --> 6966.8
no it's in a scientific it's about the

6965.28 --> 6969.199
scientific vernacular

6966.8 --> 6971.76
nathan yamaha i'm not claiming the earth

6969.199 --> 6971.759999999999
is a ball

6971.92 --> 6975.599
in a colloquial sense yes there is a

6974.56 --> 6979.52
universal

6975.599 --> 6989.84
up or down i see it more as a euclidean

6979.52 --> 6989.84
up and down

6996.4 --> 7003.839999999999
all right

7004.64 --> 7007.749000000001
[Music]

7012.159 --> 7015.759999999999
what what are you talking what is

7013.599 --> 7019.599
natural law here we go again

7015.76 --> 7021.56
what the relative density is not

7019.599 --> 7023.1990000000005
natural law as far as i know

7021.56 --> 7026.320000000001
[Music]

7023.199 --> 7031.839999999999
but on the other hand it could be but at

7026.32 --> 7031.84
least it's scientifically provable

7041.119 --> 7045.28
we don't know why but that's none of

7043.679 --> 7048.0
your concern

7045.28 --> 7050.8
science doesn't concern itself with why

7048.0 --> 7054.4
it just concerns yourself with

7050.8 --> 7055.84
is something the cause of an effect

7054.4 --> 7058.239
and you test it by varying and

7055.84 --> 7061.76
manipulating it not why

7058.239 --> 7062.718999999999
just if is it that is it the cause of

7061.76 --> 7066.4800000000005
the effect not

7062.719 --> 7066.88
why is not involved science doesn't tell

7066.48 --> 7070.638999999999
you

7066.88 --> 7070.639
why it just tells you what

7071.44 --> 7074.879999999999
you figure out why or don't and dwell up

7074.4 --> 7077.679
in

7074.88 --> 7079.04
on it forever that's your problem

7077.679 --> 7081.599
science doesn't care

7079.04 --> 7087.84
science just cares about what is and

7081.599 --> 7087.84
what is not

7095.36 --> 7099.759999999999
right so i'm gonna round out the show by

7097.599 --> 7102.400000000001
the way

7099.76 --> 7104.0
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

7102.4 --> 7106.48
liked this show

7104.0 --> 7107.84
that was well a bit slow but at the end

7106.48 --> 7111.119
has got interesting

7107.84 --> 7112.639
some interesting questions here that is

7111.119 --> 7116.48
kind of stimulating

7112.639 --> 7116.4800000000005
wish you were there like an hour ago

7117.119 --> 7122.96

last day of the year flat earth early

7148.48 --> 7153.44
bird number 763

7152.0 --> 7155.679
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

7153.44 --> 7157.04
debates it should start up any minute

7155.679 --> 7160.32
now

7157.04 --> 7162.0
ah hey samson good to see you too iron

here we go again until the next video

7168.96 --> 7171.84
keep it flat
