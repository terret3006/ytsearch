220.129 --> 224.84
a a couple of things

223.43 --> 226.4
of course the Flat Earth debate with a

224.84 --> 228.859
very long after show

226.4 --> 237.34900000000002
no after after show because I dropped

228.859 --> 240.109
after that then there was another

237.349 --> 243.67999999999998
gerrant video same as usual kind of like

240.109 --> 247.70000000000002
last time Bob talking again of course

243.68 --> 250.12900000000002
and oh yeah then iron rail media was

247.7 --> 252.67999999999998
pretty interesting and again it went

250.129 --> 255.739
over to the gravity direction and yeah I

252.68 --> 258.079
had an extra coffee that evening

255.739 --> 260.75
something I like haven't done a long

258.079 --> 262.639
time usually excited you would get in

260.75 --> 266.99
the way or something and I got like

262.639 --> 271.28000000000003
really energetic in chat you might have

266.99 --> 275.59000000000003
noticed and then Bob got in there

271.28 --> 279.13899999999995
himself and yeah I was pretty relentless

275.59 --> 281.78
because yeah for good reasons it's like

279.139 --> 282.409
people were trying to address me like oh

281.78 --> 286.01
come on

282.409 --> 289.4
really yeah yeah really like everything

286.01 --> 292.039
I'm saying here is just it's been there

289.4 --> 295.07
for a while been holding it back but the

292.039 --> 298.43
dam broke the move has been made the dam

295.07 --> 300.86
has been broken and now it's out it's

298.43 --> 303.409
not something that I just feel almost

300.86 --> 306.37
fought that had just made up no it's so

303.409 --> 310.52
based on things that that have been

306.37 --> 312.55
holding for a long time so oh yeah and

310.52 --> 316.849
after that was kind of interesting

312.55 --> 319.34000000000003
Patricia had his test reading the first

316.849 --> 321.65
one without video it was very short than

319.34 --> 325.48999999999995
the second one with video and was all

321.65 --> 329.23999999999995
successful and then kind of Patricia had

325.49 --> 331.99
some things to share and that little

329.24 --> 335.419
test turned out to be a full hour

331.99 --> 337.61
hangout it was good I think she did

335.419 --> 340.219
delete it afterwards though but it was

337.61 --> 342.349
good to be there she had some things to

340.219 --> 345.639
get off her chest and she was pretty

342.349 --> 345.639
feisty I liked it

345.65 --> 356.58
can't wait to see some more of that yeah

349.38 --> 358.59
full moon last night AGM indeed it yeah

356.58 --> 362.21999999999997
I could have filmed it but I was just

358.59 --> 366.51
too preoccupied with the media stuff to

362.22 --> 369.0
kind of get away from it and they're

366.51 --> 370.71
distracted there were also a lot of

369.0 --> 373.08
clouds though but yeah there was a

370.71 --> 376.2
pretty bright full moon in between

373.08 --> 378.68
sometimes but I didn't get to film it

376.2 --> 378.68
sorry guys

384.71 --> 394.77
well Jeffrey Belle she didn't even talk

387.3 --> 397.41
about Flat Earth barely she was just it

394.77 --> 400.169
it the entire hour it was all social

397.41 --> 405.39000000000004
talk was more about people what happened

400.169 --> 409.26
and it was yeah from the heart and I

405.39 --> 411.419
liked it yeah but Jeffrey bill she

409.26 --> 415.23
doesn't want that she doesn't want that

411.419 --> 419.669
anymore because she's sick of the trolls

415.23 --> 420.39000000000004
and she's sick of the savannahs and I

419.669 --> 424.83
totally get it

420.39 --> 427.26
it's not for her although they she have

424.83 --> 430.14
has said like yeah it's not like it

427.26 --> 431.58
means she doesn't she now believes the

430.14 --> 434.55
earth is a globe not at all

431.58 --> 436.71
not even close she just doesn't want to

434.55 --> 439.61
get into that bickering anymore

436.71 --> 439.60999999999996
and I totally get it

443.159 --> 453.969
right so well yeah hm

451.9 --> 456.56899999999996
maybe in a way or not as much a

453.969 --> 460.33
therapist as as rather just somebody

456.569 --> 463.96000000000004
sharing information in the psychological

460.33 --> 467.25899999999996
department I do it myself I do it not so

463.96 --> 471.24899999999997
I do it more layman based and on

467.259 --> 474.219
descriptions but yeah she has some

471.249 --> 477.939
knowledge herself why not why can't she

474.219 --> 479.49899999999997
share that I think it's actually kind of

477.939 --> 481.089
useful in this era there's a lot of

479.499 --> 485.259
people online with psychological

481.089 --> 487.3
problems so and other people getting

485.259 --> 489.49
bothered by those people with

487.3 --> 491.74
psychological problems so yeah I think

489.49 --> 494.189
it definitely serves a purpose I kind of

491.74 --> 494.189
do it myself

494.969 --> 507.21
Hey I flat earth space man with very

499.539 --> 507.21
weird font yeah I'm doing great

518.14 --> 523.79
so yeah that's pretty much what I've

520.37 --> 526.24
been doing yesterday evening and oh yeah

523.79 --> 528.5899999999999
that's good after that lifts the veil

526.24 --> 529.4
what's their own Benjamin in between

528.59 --> 539.96
there somewhere

529.4 --> 543.38
could be man yeah I think so or not and

539.96 --> 546.26
that I don't remember no probably not

543.38 --> 549.89
I don't know I don't remember it's

546.26 --> 553.75
stupid I watched too much videos too

549.89 --> 557.12
many videos too many live videos and

553.75 --> 561.22
yeah there yet the problem with D life

557.12 --> 565.76
though is there's not like a a record

561.22 --> 569.0600000000001
you can't keep track of as far as I've

565.76 --> 572.39
seen of what you have watched in the

569.06 --> 575.93
last period YouTube does have those

572.39 --> 577.93
functions or you could least yeah browse

575.93 --> 580.25
through what notifications you had

577.93 --> 585.64
unfortunately D life hasn't had that

580.25 --> 585.64
function as far as I could figure out

587.65 --> 591.79
it's no memory function with that oh

590.21 --> 594.99
well

591.79 --> 594.99
[Music]

598.44 --> 610.0500000000001
so any in-depth responses to the

602.55 --> 613.05
situation am i engaging with Bob for

610.05 --> 615.92
example I've heard very little feedback

613.05 --> 615.92
from it really

627.38 --> 630.1
hello

632.63 --> 636.459
wait I think my dad is stuck

641.35 --> 645.0400000000001
yeah it was suck

658.3 --> 662.43
it was an iron rail media

666.34 --> 679.3000000000001
you know Adam making channel yeah every

676.66 --> 684.16
circus I attempt not to either

679.3 --> 687.31
I always zap by just to see like okay

684.16 --> 690.6999999999999
what are they talking about but I

687.31 --> 693.25
usually don't hang around a lot unless

690.7 --> 697.48
it's like a new person that is actually

693.25 --> 700.92
interesting or that has a presentation

697.48 --> 700.9200000000001
or something but yeah

712.05 --> 716.87
[Music]

714.22 --> 719.36
but yeah it is still a big show though

716.87 --> 723.83
so it it's still relevant at it there's

719.36 --> 728.96
a lot of people that know about it yeah

723.83 --> 730.19
thanks Jeffrey bill indeed if you like

728.96 --> 733.9100000000001
this show up fold it

730.19 --> 736.72
don't forget but yeah I'll ask for that

733.91 --> 742.52
again that at the end of the show but

736.72 --> 745.0600000000001
anyway do it do it before I tell studio

742.52 --> 745.06
68

753.81 --> 760.3599999999999
yeah thanks Jeffrey bill yeah and not to

757.42 --> 764.9799999999999
toot my horn too much but I've been

760.36 --> 769.89
pretty pretty hardcore at it in the last

764.98 --> 773.98
two days do have just I don't know I

769.89 --> 777.1899999999999
have all this energy now and just trying

773.98 --> 779.23
to utilize it and at the same time yeah

777.19 --> 781.0300000000001
I still have financial issues like I

779.23 --> 783.76
don't like talking about it I almost

781.03 --> 785.35
feel like Alex Jones constantly do but

783.76 --> 787.54
it doesn't do it exactly like this of

785.35 --> 791.26
course but I do it because I have to

787.54 --> 797.56
what like being this active is also a

791.26 --> 800.3199999999999
good way to bend my frustration on yeah

797.56 --> 803.53
like a minimum diet and all that that I

800.32 --> 805.3000000000001
now kind of am forced to engage in or

803.53 --> 808.15
I'm just not going to be able to eat all

805.3 --> 811.5699999999999
that and smoke a lot less and all that

808.15 --> 817.42
it's quite frustrating to me so yeah I'm

811.57 --> 819.37
kind of trying to escape into my job or

817.42 --> 821.41
the activity that I do here my

819.37 --> 824.08
representation my mission here as a

821.41 --> 827.77
youtuber as a flat earther as a Cosmo

824.08 --> 832.0600000000001
genus in the media scape so I'm putting

827.77 --> 836.11
all the frustration including and in

832.06 --> 841.0
there and yeah trying to be constructive

836.11 --> 842.49
here so in a way if you want me to tone

841.0 --> 846.73
it down a little

842.49 --> 853.72
you could also maybe accomplish that by

846.73 --> 857.11
also donating it all depends but on the

853.72 --> 859.8000000000001
other hand you had I felt like I need to

857.11 --> 862.51
kind of like screw it down with thee

859.8 --> 865.9
well with the alcohol consumption for

862.51 --> 869.1899999999999
example and I have for a while glad of

865.9 --> 869.1899999999999
it feels much better

871.63 --> 880.01
in cannabis as well it's just I don't

874.85 --> 888.91
like that it's so expensive because it

880.01 --> 893.72
does do a lot for me hey LC what is a LC

888.91 --> 896.18
Jeffrey bill Oh alcohol right drives me

893.72 --> 898.37
out well yeah temporarily but I got

896.18 --> 904.9599999999999
plenty of water and I got look I'm

898.37 --> 907.07
plenty hydrated you know and I never

904.96 --> 909.95
like drink alcohol

907.07 --> 912.35
right before I plan to go to sleep or

909.95 --> 916.85
anything because yet I always make sure

912.35 --> 918.53
that I at least drink more water which

916.85 --> 920.09
would turn out to be like a leader or

918.53 --> 926.3299999999999
something whether it be in the form of

920.09 --> 928.72
tea or just filtered water directly yeah

926.33 --> 934.0300000000001
because I don't like to go to sleep

928.72 --> 936.38
drunk it doesn't work for me like

934.03 --> 938.03
sometimes when it's like a excitedly

936.38 --> 940.37
drink too much or something or at a

938.03 --> 942.29
party whatever then can hit me and then

940.37 --> 943.91
yeah I can go kind of almost knock out

942.29 --> 946.52
not literally but just like get really

943.91 --> 948.56
tired and feel asleep fall asleep really

946.52 --> 951.01
quickly but yeah then when you wake up

948.56 --> 954.3499999999999
the body's usually just like all

951.01 --> 957.02
disoriented or whatever it is don't

954.35 --> 960.59
recommend it so that's why I'm always

957.02 --> 962.48
sure not if I'm gonna be drinking make

960.59 --> 968.15
sure it's not going to be right before I

962.48 --> 974.15
plan to go to bed yeah but anyway that's

968.15 --> 976.04
just me for for a lot of people I think

974.15 --> 978.79
it's just better to avoid it all

976.04 --> 978.79
altogether

979.66 --> 982.93
hello Nathan

989.06 --> 991.66
right

994.22 --> 1001.07
hey-ya michael roark I there's a lot of

997.5 --> 1004.73
people that typically do do lot of

1001.07 --> 1010.7900000000001
physical workouts to bend off their

1004.73 --> 1014.12
frustrations but for me like if I do

1010.79 --> 1017.06
that especially motivated by aggression

1014.12 --> 1019.3100000000001
fueled by aggression then or frustration

1017.06 --> 1022.88
then it has kind of a negative feedback

1019.31 --> 1026.99
on my body and I tend to get back

1022.88 --> 1030.35
problems if I do that and the problem is

1026.99 --> 1032.839
also that in the current time I have to

1030.35 --> 1034.9699999999998
be very minimalistic with my food and if

1032.839 --> 1037.8799999999999
I work out and stay minimalistic with my

1034.97 --> 1040.16
food that doesn't work so it's I don't

1037.88 --> 1048.5
have the setup in order to do it like

1040.16 --> 1050.27
that because just being very active in

1048.5 --> 1053.45
chat or be is trying to stay mentally

1050.27 --> 1055.4
very focused in relation to other types

1053.45 --> 1057.88
effectively don't doesn't cost me as

1055.4 --> 1061.64
much energy you'd be surprised how

1057.88 --> 1069.71
energy efficient I've become and what I

1061.64 --> 1071.39
do by doing in my entire life but it's

1069.71 --> 1073.3700000000001
still effective to bend off the

1071.39 --> 1075.74
frustrations I just have to be careful

1073.37 --> 1081.29
not to overstep my bounds and not to

1075.74 --> 1084.34
start Sephora airing out on people kind

1081.29 --> 1084.34
of like everyone else out there

1086.83 --> 1091.8799999999999
[Music]

1096.16 --> 1104.98
box huh that's funny I have box sort of

1100.21 --> 1107.97
like as a teen I like a boxing ball it

1104.98 --> 1107.97
was a lot of fun but

1113.26 --> 1121.679
I don't know it wouldn't work over here

1137.899 --> 1141.9799999999998
are you talking to Nathan

1146.16 --> 1149.15
who's Doug

1157.37 --> 1164.03
No yeah big chunga's yeah the

1160.34 --> 1166.1899999999998
face-to-face boxing no no I am NOT cool

1164.03 --> 1169.51
with getting hit in the face that

1166.19 --> 1169.51
doesn't work out for me at all

1179.25 --> 1188.14
now my primary skill are one of my main

1185.71 --> 1193.24
skills that I even trained during actual

1188.14 --> 1198.24
sport Taekwondo is evasion and utilizing

1193.24 --> 1201.13
my deeper intuition at it so that is I

1198.24 --> 1201.79
don't need any practice being hit in the

1201.13 --> 1208.18
face

1201.79 --> 1210.9099999999999
I don't plant it hard my bone structure

1208.18 --> 1215.3100000000002
the muscle whatever no I don't want

1210.91 --> 1215.3100000000002
don't need that it's not good

1230.51 --> 1239.85
hah Cleary

1233.82 --> 1241.6789999999999
oh nice good to hear lost 20 pounds less

1239.85 --> 1244.86
affected by relative density

1241.679 --> 1251.549
disequilibrium well that depends on the

1244.86 --> 1254.789
medium you're gonna be in because like

1251.549 --> 1255.62
fat and let's assume that's what you

1254.789 --> 1260.85
lost

1255.62 --> 1264.33
it has doesn't have a very high density

1260.85 --> 1267.78
compared to other materials within your

1264.33 --> 1270.9289999999999
body so your density may have actually

1267.78 --> 1273.87
become greater in relation yeah be the

1270.929 --> 1277.159
mask on combined mast towards volume

1273.87 --> 1277.1589999999999
you'd be surprised

1278.45 --> 1286.8300000000002
but anyway yeah well done twenty pounds

1282.63 --> 1289.0490000000002
is quite a quite lot I think it would be

1286.83 --> 1292.59
huge amount for me but I don't want to

1289.049 --> 1295.6689999999999
lose 20 pounds sheesh like these skin

1292.59 --> 1295.6689999999999
skin and bones

1296.84 --> 1304.2389999999998
[Music]

1309.149 --> 1314.789
no they lie Ohio have no idea what

1312.249 --> 1314.789
you're talking about

1331.7 --> 1334.769
[Music]

1344.85 --> 1352.23
that science says well now science is

1348.389 --> 1355.7099999999998
not an it's not a sentient being with a

1352.23 --> 1359.909
consciousness in order to say things but

1355.71 --> 1361.95
yeah according to the gravity theory

1359.909 --> 1364.5
which is not really a theory just a

1361.95 --> 1366.1490000000001
concept because people are still trying

1364.5 --> 1370.35
to figure out what it actually is

1366.149 --> 1371.639
supposed to be suggest the storytelling

1370.35 --> 1376.4399999999998
that has been done about it

1371.639 --> 1379.769
over this century that gravity or some

1376.44 --> 1382.009
presumed force or not actually force but

1379.769 --> 1385.23
you can think of it as a force is

1382.009 --> 1387.059
decreasing over distance to the center

1385.23 --> 1390.059
of the presupposed spherical earth yeah

1387.059 --> 1393.299
that's a really nice fantasy however any

1390.059 --> 1396.1789999999999
kind of real measurement does not

1393.299 --> 1399.679
confirm that in the slightest there's

1396.179 --> 1405.5
yeah there's no relative density change

1399.679 --> 1405.5
the things don't fall slower I up

1405.919 --> 1410.46
technically things actually should be

1408.96 --> 1413.8500000000001
falling faster

1410.46 --> 1416.759
objects with the same weight in lower

1413.85 --> 1418.7099999999998
density layer of the of the realm

1416.759 --> 1425.22
should fall faster because there's less

1418.71 --> 1428.3700000000001
air friction and then slow down slightly

1425.22 --> 1432.3890000000001
as it and as it enters the thicker air

1428.37 --> 1437.4899999999998
layers so yeah it's it's all fiction

1432.389 --> 1439.799
in theory gravity should decrease as

1437.49 --> 1443.429
you'd go away from the earth but in

1439.799 --> 1447.83
reality there's no no proof to back up

1443.429 --> 1447.8300000000002
that concept so

1455.33 --> 1459.989
it should not be written off it is

1458.399 --> 1462.149
strange yeah well you know what that's

1459.989 --> 1464.7
called it's called an aberration it's

1462.149 --> 1466.859
something you see you have ideas about

1464.7 --> 1471.179
but you can't figure out what it is and

1466.859 --> 1473.82
you just get obsessed with it like what

1471.179 --> 1476.8200000000002
is this what is this oh it isn't

1473.82 --> 1478.4399999999998
anything because if it was you would get

1476.82 --> 1482.869
some trace of it no it's an illusion

1478.44 --> 1486.8690000000001
it's an aberration it's a combination of

1482.869 --> 1489.9599999999998
things that are very suggestive when you

1486.869 --> 1493.4399999999998
try to fold the circle in mechanical

1489.96 --> 1496.769
systems that there is potentially a

1493.44 --> 1499.6090000000002
force this equilibrium constant present

1496.769 --> 1506.479
at all time yeah that's all mechanical

1499.609 --> 1510.749
to the complete the sum but it is

1506.479 --> 1512.999
conceptual it is just a side effect of

1510.749 --> 1516.059
of technical modeling of what's going on

1512.999 --> 1517.919
but every time a technical modeling is

1516.059 --> 1519.809
done it's always incomplete it's always

1517.919 --> 1521.789
focusing on the specific structure

1519.809 --> 1525.299
within the realm and not the entire

1521.789 --> 1527.82
thing and that's the problem because

1525.299 --> 1530.279
otherwise yeah the hypothesis would be

1527.82 --> 1532.2
so the whole system would be so

1530.279 --> 1536.129
convoluted and complex is you can't

1532.2 --> 1539.94
explain that all right but actual

1536.129 --> 1543.149
gravity it lends all these elements from

1539.94 --> 1545.969
all these different things and yeah it's

1543.149 --> 1549.7489999999998
super suggestive I fell for it is it

1545.969 --> 1553.3990000000001
still it still echoes on but I just I'm

1549.749 --> 1556.08
not gonna chase that dragon again

1553.399 --> 1558.629
because I can't reach it and I know that

1556.08 --> 1561.779
now and everything I've seen about it

1558.629 --> 1565.4089999999999
suggests this exactly so I'm just gonna

1561.779 --> 1569.429
see it for what it is an aberration put

1565.409 --> 1571.469
together elements that just heavily

1569.429 --> 1573.3890000000001
suggest something but at the core of it

1571.469 --> 1578.04
there's nothing there and there never

1573.389 --> 1580.86
was because this side thing

1578.04 --> 1583.32
that makes it seem like one singular

1580.86 --> 1585.8999999999999
thing that is an illusion it's an

1583.32 --> 1589.49
illusion that people made when they

1585.9 --> 1592.38
start to model separate things out and

1589.49 --> 1597.39
that's just the aberration it is really

1592.38 --> 1600.5400000000002
a pretty bizarre thing that is what it

1597.39 --> 1605.13
is ghost an aberration it's not real

1600.54 --> 1608.49
it's no use trying to find out because

1605.13 --> 1614.3700000000001
there is no empirical trace to be found

1608.49 --> 1618.75
of it there's just these standard

1614.37 --> 1621.09
mechanics of what happens and the things

1618.75 --> 1625.07
you can lend from the them and put

1621.09 --> 1625.07
together into a fictional concept

1646.81 --> 1653.11
yeah yeah Nathan ugly orbits back the

1651.19 --> 1655.75
question definitely not a little bit

1653.11 --> 1658.8
either because it even introduces this

1655.75 --> 1661.96
fictional stretch of the imagination

1658.8 --> 1664.12
concept that something is falling it

1661.96 --> 1667.23
perpetually in a circle around something

1664.12 --> 1670.6899999999998
else because of like a gravity

1667.23 --> 1677.1100000000001
equilibrium balance it's very far

1670.69 --> 1686.98
stretched concept juggling almost

1677.11 --> 1693.9699999999998
literally like juggling exactly Nathan

1686.98 --> 1696.76
Oakley yeah only thing we observe

1693.97 --> 1698.59
anything that could remotely resemble

1696.76 --> 1699.46
the concept would be concerning

1698.59 --> 1701.26
magnetics

1699.46 --> 1706.95
but yeah magnetics is just something

1701.26 --> 1710.11
entirely different this is you know

1706.95 --> 1712.78
magnetics inspired very blatantly

1710.11 --> 1714.9099999999999
obviously so the mass attracting mass

1712.78 --> 1717.1299999999999
and I bet that even in the very very

1714.91 --> 1719.5900000000001
very early stages when it was kind of

1717.13 --> 1721.9
still occult all of this idea the

1719.59 --> 1724.72
concept of the the globe mechanics and

1721.9 --> 1728.41
you know that gesture with things that

1724.72 --> 1732.82
they might fool people with actual

1728.41 --> 1735.4
magnets see like yes he see it because

1732.82 --> 1738.73
the normal people would not back then

1735.4 --> 1740.7
would not be as savvy with how physics

1738.73 --> 1743.17
mechanics works and then what magnetic

1740.7 --> 1744.43
magnets really will are and how they

1743.17 --> 1746.5900000000001
function they might have seen like

1744.43 --> 1748.15
groove that that it could be is more

1746.59 --> 1750.79
easily fooled so they would just

1748.15 --> 1755.8600000000001
completely trick them nowadays yeah they

1750.79 --> 1758.23
have to people have basic education

1755.86 --> 1759.8799999999999
about the some things and so they can't

1758.23 --> 1763.03
they wouldn't be able to do that anymore

1759.88 --> 1766.99
now they have to just use the complex

1763.03 --> 1768.94
machination of the Cavendish setup in

1766.99 --> 1771.99
order to suggest it's not even

1768.94 --> 1775.95
hypothesize it but just suggest that

1771.99 --> 1775.95
masses are attracted to mass

1802.15 --> 1810.779
the second law has nothing to say about

1807.179 --> 1813.6100000000001
gravitationally bound gasps

1810.779 --> 1816.49
no [ __ ] why do you think that is

1813.61 --> 1818.559
maybe because the second law just deals

1816.49 --> 1820.51
with nature and everything and not

1818.559 --> 1822.4289999999999
concept your mechanics why would it

1820.51 --> 1824.529
involve conceptual mechanics when

1822.429 --> 1826.74
they're conceptual and the second law is

1824.529 --> 1826.74
not

1854.51 --> 1860.36
spectroscopy spectroscopist

1864.3 --> 1870.77
or spectroscopy is that is that why it's

1868.5 --> 1870.77
called

1894.78 --> 1903.29
oh I'm gonna look that up this first

1899.4 --> 1912.0
time I figured at that did she Hellion

1903.29 --> 1913.74
great name by the way an

1912.0 --> 1918.65
eighteenth-century

1913.74 --> 1921.51
determining mean dance Oh God

1918.65 --> 1929.7900000000002
funded by the grant from the Royal

1921.51 --> 1932.64
Society you experiment involves

1929.79 --> 1935.28
measuring the tiny deflection of a

1932.64 --> 1937.8000000000002
pendulum due to the gravitational

1935.28 --> 1938.52
attraction of a nearby mountain oh that

1937.8 --> 1941.43
thing

1938.52 --> 1943.71
the Magni had the magnetite mountain

1941.43 --> 1946.44
yeah that's lovely yeah I've heard of

1943.71 --> 1952.92
that one before it I forgot because it's

1946.44 --> 1958.41
so lightly ridiculous pretty sure it

1952.92 --> 1964.3500000000001
hasn't been repeated or not by people

1958.41 --> 1966.21
that really meant it maybe she's just

1964.35 --> 1970.77
not published I don't know but it's just

1966.21 --> 1972.57
such a ridiculous system if that would

1970.77 --> 1974.75
really work then it should work with any

1972.57 --> 1981.95
freaking mountain and it doesn't

1974.75 --> 1981.95
absolutely it does not yeah

1982.55 --> 1985.54
hilarious

2031.32 --> 2037.5
what Wow

2034.56 --> 2041.73
I gotta read this part Nathan this is

2037.5 --> 2043.82
you know what I'm gonna show it it's

2041.73 --> 2052.7
just special

2043.82 --> 2052.7
what oh wait yeah almost forgot

2054.01 --> 2056.639
yeah

2061.89 --> 2068.0099999999998
all done need to resize stuff again

2099.46 --> 2103.96
all right I hope you can read some of

2101.68 --> 2109.1189999999997
this I'm not too sure let me take a

2103.96 --> 2112.7400000000002
quick look that doesn't work super hard

2109.119 --> 2112.7400000000002
delay great anyway

2123.15 --> 2131.62
yes that works okay I think it's

2126.49 --> 2134.0499999999997
properly visible all right so look at

2131.62 --> 2137.3399999999997
this background a pendulum hank's

2134.05 --> 2141.9100000000003
straight downwards in a symmetrical

2137.34 --> 2144.73
gravitational field in physics a

2141.91 --> 2147.79
gravitational field is a model used to

2144.73 --> 2150.13
explain the influence that a massive

2147.79 --> 2152.59
body extends into a space around itself

2150.13 --> 2155.8
producing a force another memorable oh

2152.59 --> 2162.79
yeah right so a pendulum hangs straight

2155.8 --> 2165.3100000000004
down in a model fascinating how does

2162.79 --> 2167.44
that work however if a sufficient large

2165.31 --> 2169.33
message is the mountain is nearby its

2167.44 --> 2178.9500000000003
gravitation should pull the pendulum

2169.33 --> 2178.95
blob so it seems kind of weird

2189.75 --> 2202.41
and of course they drag in planets and

2192.54 --> 2205.41
moons and blah Newton's idea really was

2202.41 --> 2208.83
it Newton's idea that mass did attract

2205.41 --> 2212.0989999999997
mass not sure was

2208.83 --> 2214.56
I didn't claim my hypothesis for for it

2212.099 --> 2219.9300000000003
at least for gravitation

2214.56 --> 2226.83
I guess they said Newton's idea so I

2219.93 --> 2229.47
guess that provide would both provide

2226.83 --> 2233.7599999999998
supporting evidence for his law of

2229.47 --> 2236.48
universal gravitation right his law okay

2233.76 --> 2240.09
its law in his mechanical

2236.48 --> 2247.76
conceptualization of things so in his

2240.09 --> 2252.119
model because it's not a natural law and

2247.76 --> 2257.2700000000004
pretty sure yeah that he didn't claim

2252.119 --> 2257.27
hypothesis oh yeah

2263.52 --> 2272.85
yeah anyway yeah that's a that's what

2268.29 --> 2276.79
the she Hallion experiment contains

2272.85 --> 2278.8199999999997
let's put the link out for those look it

2276.79 --> 2278.82
up

2279.09 --> 2282.26
[Music]

2291.8 --> 2295.75
Oh people getting active

2310.07 --> 2312.76
that

2314.099 --> 2321.339
and ethnically a spectrometer oh it

2318.19 --> 2324.66
doesn't it doesn't really do anything

2321.339 --> 2332.2599999999998
what it just does is analyze light and

2324.66 --> 2336.24
then divine or extrapolate material

2332.26 --> 2340.78
aspects of it based reflected back up on

2336.24 --> 2341.589
actual material testing and to really

2340.78 --> 2344.5
see what that is

2341.589 --> 2347.109
but yeah with all the materials on earth

2344.5 --> 2350.8
it's actually been confirmed that that

2347.109 --> 2353.3489999999997
is material so they just presuppose that

2350.8 --> 2355.599
all these lights that they analyze out

2353.349 --> 2360.46
there have to be the same thing that's

2355.599 --> 2363.46
what they presuppose they have no actual

2360.46 --> 2366.579
evidence to back that up and have it not

2363.46 --> 2382.51
even any kind of like moon signal

2366.579 --> 2385.869
rebalance or anything yeah well Jeffrey

2382.51 --> 2387.7900000000004
Brown volcano mage even if you would

2385.869 --> 2391.329
consider Cavendish experiment it's not

2387.79 --> 2393.7
actually an experiment to prove that

2391.329 --> 2395.76
math supposedly attracts mass that's the

2393.7 --> 2399.8799999999997
funny thing the hypothesis concerns

2395.76 --> 2403.44
weighing the mass of the earth based on

2399.88 --> 2403.44
a couple of presuppositions though

2404.369 --> 2409.54
that's what the experiment whether you

2407.47 --> 2411.22
think it's legitimate your legitimate

2409.54 --> 2412.63
with all those presuppositions or not

2411.22 --> 2415.7799999999997
that is what it's about it's not about

2412.63 --> 2419.7400000000002
mass attracting mass it's weird how that

2415.78 --> 2426.73
has kind of been forwarded in popular

2419.74 --> 2429.7799999999997
culture because yeah gravitation that's

2426.73 --> 2433.119
what it's presupposing that effects

2429.78 --> 2436.8100000000004
concerning the concept of gravitation

2433.119 --> 2441.48
our lens or presupposed in order to

2436.81 --> 2441.48
prove the weight of the earth

2442.359 --> 2446.759
that's what it's really about weird

2444.369 --> 2446.759
isn't it

2449.29 --> 2452.449
[Music]

2454.81 --> 2457.929
[Music]

2470.95 --> 2478.1499999999996
that what talking to me big chunga's

2475.359 --> 2483.339
same old tired arguments

2478.15 --> 2487.39
flatty's always ring well maybe it's

2483.339 --> 2491.5299999999997
just us pointing out the things that you

2487.39 --> 2494.92
are using and actually providing the

2491.53 --> 2499.21
original context and meaning of what it

2494.92 --> 2501.4300000000003
is they were doing officially right yeah

2499.21 --> 2504.13
that's the same old tired flirty

2501.43 --> 2507.79
arguments I know it's actually pointing

2504.13 --> 2510.6600000000003
out the reality of what you're using for

2507.79 --> 2514.079
your religious glow belief reaffirmation

2510.66 --> 2517.24
without actually realizing what it is

2514.079 --> 2519.94
technically exactly what you are using

2517.24 --> 2524.25
to do that yeah that's the same old

2519.94 --> 2524.25
tired Flat Earth arguments I know

2557.41 --> 2564.58
mmm-hmm lights in the sky are clues yep

2568.87 --> 2577.64
they certainly are gotta be careful not

2574.55 --> 2579.92
to stick on a lot of fantasies upon

2577.64 --> 2583.73
those clues and just go with those

2579.92 --> 2586.87
fantasies as a baseline I would

2583.73 --> 2586.87
recommend against it

2586.93 --> 2590.16
[Music]

2592.39 --> 2598.58
really

2593.57 --> 2603.6800000000003
Jeffrey bond okay no okay no image right

2598.58 --> 2608.74
it's not volcano mate or whatever what

2603.68 --> 2610.7599999999998
what tells you that circular star trails

2608.74 --> 2614.54
cannot be viewed from different

2610.76 --> 2620.8700000000003
positions on the Flat Earth so why do

2614.54 --> 2622.91
you claim that based on what how did you

2620.87 --> 2623.72
derive that conclusion that that is

2622.91 --> 2630.68
impossible

2623.72 --> 2635.2099999999996
I hear that kind of assertion all the

2630.68 --> 2638.39
time it's like glow bears have a lot of

2635.21 --> 2643.25
trouble just really conceptualizing what

2638.39 --> 2645.44
Flat Earth is and how we view the the

2643.25 --> 2647.27
yeah the layout of the realm on all the

2645.44 --> 2647.6
consequences and mechanics of what's

2647.27 --> 2650.63
going

2647.6 --> 2655.25
it seems that Glover's all have very

2650.63 --> 2659.0
pure poor view on what it really is that

2655.25 --> 2661.49
we deal with and what we say because

2659.0 --> 2664.07
they always bring out this very flimsy

2661.49 --> 2665.99
idea I guess they don't even describe it

2664.07 --> 2667.7000000000003
they just said this is impossible on the

2665.99 --> 2670.79
flatter so what flat earth are you

2667.7 --> 2673.3399999999997
talking about your poor incomplete view

2670.79 --> 2676.82
of how it's supposed to work according

2673.34 --> 2679.9100000000003
to you with the flat earthers while we

2676.82 --> 2680.3
don't use that oversimplified dumbed

2679.91 --> 2684.1
down

2680.3 --> 2684.1000000000004
incomplete version of the Flat Earth

2684.88 --> 2689.87
because it yeah you really don't know

2688.19 --> 2690.86
what you're talking about every time you

2689.87 --> 2692.9
say that

2690.86 --> 2697.63
this can't work on the player that can't

2692.9 --> 2697.63
work how do you know based on what

2710.16 --> 2715.69
of course they're never gonna address

2712.18 --> 2717.04
that I'm just gonna red herring off to

2715.69 --> 2718.359
another subject nerd

2717.04 --> 2721.9
oh look at the planets look at the

2718.359 --> 2724.839
planets he proves everything we see

2721.9 --> 2727.089
something it is kind of spherical alike

2724.839 --> 2729.25
or we could think of it as spherical it

2727.089 --> 2732.04
kind of is a circle this ski whatever it

2729.25 --> 2736.03
is planets proves it's proves we're on a

2732.04 --> 2739.81
ball all the planets out there proves

2736.03 --> 2753.13
were on a ball suppo it's all circular

2739.81 --> 2755.16
we have to live on a ball so what did he

2753.13 --> 2755.1600000000003
say

2763.7 --> 2766.359
yeah

2767.35 --> 2770.35

can get around with that for potentially

2955.039 --> 2957.619
until the evening but I'll feel really

2956.509 --> 2968.21
hungry then

2957.619 --> 2971.94
but thanks Bates 60 RMC I really truly

2968.21 --> 2975.0190000000002

[Music]

2979.18 --> 2981.93
it's

2989.63 --> 2994.619
it's just kind of a big tension shift

2992.52 --> 2999.329
all of a sudden I really didn't expect

2994.619 --> 3001.28
this it's just not like a thought maybe

2999.329 --> 3006.65
yeah I don't know what do you know I

3001.28 --> 3010.78
don't know what really like and it's

3006.65 --> 3012.98
their private concern you know so but

3010.78 --> 3017.4500000000003
sometimes I just don't know what to

3012.98 --> 3020.51
expect like am I gonna have to keep on

3017.45 --> 3023.109
begging for a while or just tone down or

3020.51 --> 3028.059
what can I expect and then suddenly

3023.109 --> 3028.0589999999997
people do help me out it's just awesome

3028.15 --> 3036.17
but I don't really expect it even though

3033.8 --> 3039.829
I chiton it I really need it but just

3036.17 --> 3048.14
you can't expect it's not good because

3039.829 --> 3051.549

3048.14 --> 3054.17
time Jose yeah it's Saturday remember so

addressing Jose oh I totally get why

3143.63 --> 3149.84
Jose isn't getting bored it is because

3147.4 --> 3154.04
yeah there are still flat earthers

3149.84 --> 3156.4100000000003
coming in and they do breathe a lot of

3154.04 --> 3158.87
life into things get the ballers I'll

3156.41 --> 3161.54
rattle up and I think that Jose thinks

3158.87 --> 3164.93
that that is very exciting he's always

3161.54 --> 3167.83
very welcoming to a flat earthers really

3164.93 --> 3167.83
have you taken notice

3168.94 --> 3174.68
but yeah it's the Polish that are always

3171.35 --> 3176.33
just filling it up they think it's a

3174.68 --> 3179.1499999999996
better corner kind of like the Flat

3176.33 --> 3181.25
Earth debate was in the beginning but

3179.15 --> 3184.82
yeah Flat Earth debates and just our

3181.25 --> 3186.86
knowledge bases kind of progress too

3184.82 --> 3189.28

try not to be too silly and drunk

3322.8 --> 3330.869
because yeah that's because I'm gonna be

3328.59 --> 3333.69
very freaking relief this evening if you

3330.869 --> 3336.78
know what I mean but I'll try not to get

3333.69 --> 3339.05
too and not try try the mute as much as

3336.78 --> 3341.28
I can

3339.05 --> 3343.4900000000002
seriously I'm not gonna get on peoples

3341.28 --> 3349.4100000000003
nerves I'll make sure of that

3343.49 --> 3353.04
yeah okay Nathan just started up a

3349.41 --> 3362.04
premiere I'm still gonna do my hour show

3353.04 --> 3366.38
another hour though qyz number one Fe

3362.04 --> 3369.0299999999997
proof oh so it's not a live show so

3366.38 --> 3371.599
that's not a premiere is that what

3369.03 --> 3371.599
you're saying Adam

3387.26 --> 3394.46
a full belly makes everyone feel better

3390.32 --> 3397.88
well yeah I agree dang you know there is

3394.46 --> 3402.92
something to not always being full you

3397.88 --> 3408.53
know and having like I figured out kind

3402.92 --> 3411.71
of I guess it is based on Hermeticism I

3408.53 --> 3413.8100000000004
guess a bit it's just up and down so I

3411.71 --> 3416.45
always say like okay that it's good to

3413.81 --> 3419.24
have periods where you just eat less or

3416.45 --> 3422.7799999999997
minimum and kind of fasting or full

3419.24 --> 3426.3199999999997
fasting if you can do that and then go

3422.78 --> 3429.4700000000003
back up and have small Peaks where you

3426.32 --> 3431.54
just really and your but if your body

3429.47 --> 3433.91
tells you to you know if your body

3431.54 --> 3436.67
actually responds to the consumption of

3433.91 --> 3438.83
food if you can palpably feel your body

3436.67 --> 3441.88
restore and all that yeah then you

3438.83 --> 3445.64
should eat a little bit more if you can

3441.88 --> 3447.6800000000003
but yeah stuffing yourself in certain

3445.64 --> 3452.27
conditions doesn't always help and then

3447.68 --> 3456.43
you have to respond to that so but yeah

3452.27 --> 3456.43
I do feel like I could definitely use

3457.06 --> 3463.79
well some lunch at least but it's good

3461.869 --> 3466.28
to know that now I'm gonna have some

3463.79 --> 3467.72
certainty of just not having to worry

3466.28 --> 3470.27
about where I'm gonna pluck the money

3467.72 --> 3471.7999999999997
from in order to just guarantee some

3470.27 --> 3473.84
dinner everyday in the next week so

3471.8 --> 3477.94
thank you so much everyone

3473.84 --> 3477.94
series thank you so much

3488.12 --> 3492.0989999999997
the

3489.7 --> 3494.5
oh by the way I have to mention for a

3492.099 --> 3497.4700000000003
second it's they shouldn't it's gonna

3494.5 --> 3501.01
draw biting but it was so hilarious

3497.47 --> 3503.29
somebody I think it was Pete Mars you

3501.01 --> 3505.9900000000002
know Pete Mars is a complete maniac but

3503.29 --> 3509.2599999999998
he just has this weird creative tendency

3505.99 --> 3514.9599999999996
sometimes and he appeared I think I

3509.26 --> 3517.8590000000004
think it was him with a NPC Mars and he

3514.96 --> 3521.5
had kind of like a photograph of himself

3517.859 --> 3523.69
but dronin with the grey and the dot

3521.5 --> 3527.89
eyes and striped mouth and all that [ __ ]

3523.69 --> 3533.14
so he like NPC Mars and it was him is

3527.89 --> 3537.609
like wow just wow dude that is that is

3533.14 --> 3543.339
special did so yeah a creative shout out

3537.609 --> 3545.609
to be Mars this is that's about it all

3543.339 --> 3548.589
other shout outs pretty much retracted

3545.609 --> 3551.0789999999997
but yeah that was freaking hilarious

3548.589 --> 3555.359
wonder if he's gonna that's gonna pop by

3551.079 --> 3559.119
and PC Mars with like a hand-drawn

3555.359 --> 3564.97
custom-made I can that is an actual NPC

3559.119 --> 3570.099
meme of himself it's just it's brilliant

3564.97 --> 3572.3799999999997
I love it when a meme comes together

3570.099 --> 3575.559

key you asked me if I am vegetarian

3624.93 --> 3632.569
right well I have been vegetarian for

3627.589 --> 3635.91
yeah for two and a half years right

3632.569 --> 3643.5589999999997
right yeah exactly two and a half years

3635.91 --> 3646.47
and yeah I seized that I'm back to well

3643.559 --> 3651.0890000000004
pretty much where I was but with a lot

3646.47 --> 3654.27
more food option input to choose from

3651.089 --> 3658.14
now because I've learned to also have

3654.27 --> 3660.96
very satisfactory vegetarian meals that

3658.14 --> 3663.27
I can easily make so i adapted my old

3660.96 --> 3667.14
food pattern where I always had meat and

3663.27 --> 3669.059
everything and now kind of shifted some

3667.14 --> 3672.68
meals and others are kind of back on the

3669.059 --> 3675.21
menu and I'm really happy about that so

3672.68 --> 3676.68
for example what I'm gonna have for

3675.21 --> 3679.71
dinner because that is kind of what I

3676.68 --> 3685.5
got with my last few cents this morning

3679.71 --> 3693.839
is not baked but cooked potatoes with

3685.5 --> 3694.29
with the the the what is what do you

3693.839 --> 3698.49
call that

3694.29 --> 3701.7
with the cover still on it ah can't seem

3698.49 --> 3705.4199999999996
to find the English word for that the

3701.7 --> 3707.339
peel with the peel on it right don't get

3705.42 --> 3710.28
it off it's organic so just wash a

3707.339 --> 3714.3289999999997
little and then cut it up cook it and

3710.28 --> 3717.9
leave it all on and red beets cooked

3714.329 --> 3721.98
aside separately and a good

3717.9 --> 3727.02
old-fashioned beef sausage a really good

3721.98 --> 3731.97
one and yeah pick it all up with butter

3727.02 --> 3733.53
and yeah you get some really good gravy

3731.97 --> 3736.8289999999997
but you have to pay attention not to

3733.53 --> 3739.799
overheat it or all that a really good

3736.829 --> 3742.77
gravy on those yeah eventually mashed

3739.799 --> 3745.859
potatoes and it is just a very rich meal

3742.77 --> 3749.479
very satisfactory for

3745.859 --> 3752.759
yeah when I eat that in the in the

3749.479 --> 3754.589
somewhat late evening not super late I'm

3752.759 --> 3758.069
like I don't really need to eat anymore

3754.589 --> 3763.999
the entire night it's really

3758.069 --> 3766.41
satisfactory so yeah I don't have any

3763.999 --> 3768.5389999999998
problems said I've started eating meat

3766.41 --> 3771.69
again no it seems to be digesting just

3768.539 --> 3774.719
perfectly so and my body asked for it

3771.69 --> 3778.43
I'm doing what it tells me and it's

3774.719 --> 3781.38
working and I'm yeah it's working out

3778.43 --> 3783.269
although at the same time I am also

3781.38 --> 3785.759
taking kind of typical winter

3783.269 --> 3790.9399999999996
supplements a lot so what I have been

3785.759 --> 3793.289
taking in the last month at least

3790.94 --> 3797.15
alright now it's much more than that

3793.289 --> 3797.15
like last half-year pretty much is

3799.279 --> 3805.849
spirulina tablets organic by the way

3804.54 --> 3813.39
[Music]

3805.849 --> 3817.799
call again a stuck Sun team it's kind of

3813.39 --> 3820.609
like a algae extract it's very healthy

3817.799 --> 3824.849
and fish oil and recently since

3820.609 --> 3826.3489999999997
Christmas yeah my is my stepmother gave

3824.849 --> 3829.6800000000003
me a whole bunch of supplements and I've

3826.349 --> 3837.3900000000003
been taking vitamin b12 which I kind of

3829.68 --> 3842.219
missed take a selenium so plant-based by

3837.39 --> 3845.759
the way vitamin d3 and I especially

3842.219 --> 3847.559
noticed a vitamin d3 so I got I keep

3845.759 --> 3850.279
this here the other ones I keep in my in

3847.559 --> 3850.279
my cooler

3853.48 --> 3867.32
so that also helps where do I get my

3861.74 --> 3870.2
meat well at the organic it's it's all

3867.32 --> 3872.51
organic grocery store that it's a

3870.2 --> 3874.3399999999997
franchise over here it's in the

3872.51 --> 3875.9900000000002
Netherlands it's in Germany I think it's

3874.34 --> 3877.67
it's really doing its best to spread out

3875.99 --> 3881.2999999999997
as much as possible it is trying to

3877.67 --> 3885.58
conquer the organic market pretty pretty

3881.3 --> 3888.59
heavily its they're not uncompetitive

3885.58 --> 3892.97
but yeah they have great products and

3888.59 --> 3895.52
that's where I get almost everything but

3892.97 --> 3898.43
I do keep tabs on I always check the

3895.52 --> 3901.04
labels when I try new product I do try

3898.43 --> 3903.29
things out I talked to the people I

3901.04 --> 3905.81
talked about what I think is going on in

3903.29 --> 3908.72
the food and I keep tabs like I am

3905.81 --> 3911.33
originally you know like ten years ago I

3908.72 --> 3914.48
was even like maybe I could get into the

3911.33 --> 3916.0699999999997
organic food business so I've kind of

3914.48 --> 3919.4
had that interest never really engaged

3916.07 --> 3923.09
try to get a job but too old and

3919.4 --> 3925.01
whatever you know they they they still

3923.09 --> 3928.9700000000003
there still grocery stores they still

3925.01 --> 3930.8300000000004
want like 16 years old 16 year olds it's

3928.97 --> 3933.9199999999996
gonna be too expensive all that so

3930.83 --> 3936.71
whatever or people that have been like

3933.92 --> 3940.07
into the profession and that for a long

3936.71 --> 3945.11
time and everything but yeah I've always

3940.07 --> 3953.26
kept tabs and that's where I get most of

3945.11 --> 3953.26
my food meat prefab products my alcohol

3953.77 --> 3961.4
and they have good brands and I kind of

3957.17 --> 3963.38
reviewed them to to the store you know

3961.4 --> 3965.21
every time I've have been taking a

3963.38 --> 3967.34
product newly I will be telling like

3965.21 --> 3970.0
yeah I really like this especially

3967.34 --> 3973.46
compared to that one that one just to

3970.0 --> 3975.4
get the film familiarity of the product

3973.46 --> 3980.45
out there as much as possible because

3975.4 --> 3983.3
yeah in relation to the the big standard

3980.45 --> 3984.22
food chain stores they still don't get

3983.3 --> 3989.5
that level

3984.22 --> 3991.48
of customers so yeah and it look in

3989.5 --> 3994.24
general people that go to organic stores

3991.48 --> 3996.22
do really care about the quality of the

3994.24 --> 3997.8399999999997
products so it's good to have that

3996.22 --> 4000.54
knowledge out there it's always it's

3997.84 --> 4004.77
also good for the store if everybody

4000.54 --> 4008.46
knows about every product it's very its

4004.77 --> 4011.04
stimulating so anyway the but that's

4008.46 --> 4015.83
just my what I do that's where I get my

4011.04 --> 4020.54
food yeah it's called the Eco Plaza

4015.83 --> 4020.54
that's the chain store

4028.29 --> 4035.4
and it's kind of interesting because

4030.21 --> 4037.92
they're also liberals in a way but

4035.4 --> 4042.4100000000003
they're very specific eco liberals and

4037.92 --> 4044.25
and they don't like to overemphasize

4042.41 --> 4046.3199999999997
climate change they're not like

4044.25 --> 4049.74
outspoken against it which is kind of

4046.32 --> 4052.11
tactically wise I guess they try to

4049.74 --> 4054.7799999999997
cooperate but they have other projects

4052.11 --> 4060.09
environment projects like they for

4054.78 --> 4063.51
example specifically promotes against

4060.09 --> 4067.44
plastic and they really adapt even their

4063.51 --> 4069.15
products to replacing plastic with other

4067.44 --> 4071.7000000000003
substances that are more environmentally

4069.15 --> 4075.27
friendly but just as effective and over

4071.7 --> 4077.64
the last 15 years I've seen the changes

4075.27 --> 4080.88
in the type of bags like it's been

4077.64 --> 4084.54
changed several times in like trying out

4080.88 --> 4086.04
new products like and can't good review

4084.54 --> 4089.61
I reviewed those as well as like okay

4086.04 --> 4092.0099999999998
this is not good or this one breaks to

4089.61 --> 4094.61
eat so they've tried out many things and

4092.01 --> 4097.29
they got a pretty good alternative now

4094.61 --> 4099.95
that I'm kind of satisfied about and

4097.29 --> 4103.85
also the other plastic soup foundation

4099.95 --> 4106.44
to be fair I have not been very generous

4103.85 --> 4110.819
donated to them because I usually just

4106.44 --> 4114.24
need the money but I in spirit I

4110.819 --> 4117.299
definitely support that endeavor so I

4114.24 --> 4120.0289999999995
kind of like the Eco Plaza and they also

4117.299 --> 4121.5
are very promotional of their farmers

4120.029 --> 4125.339000000001
they even have like video screens

4121.5 --> 4127.319
playing out that looks as still like oh

4125.339 --> 4129.9
this is where we make this product this

4127.319 --> 4133.319
is how this is where we get our did yeah

4129.9 --> 4135.74
this is the farm and I don't know I just

4133.319 --> 4135.740000000001
like it

4137.329 --> 4150.889
I like the atmosphere I like the people

4141.109 --> 4153.819
that come there as well although yeah

4150.889 --> 4161.409000000001
there's also yeah typical liberal types

4153.819 --> 4163.79
as well yeah I don't get in people's way

4161.409 --> 4168.44
I'm not gonna make a scene in my

4163.79 --> 4170.42
favorite store although kind of sort of

4168.44 --> 4172.94
have done that but like in the beginning

4170.42 --> 4174.469
but I was just so frustrated back then

4172.94 --> 4176.989
that I would typically just create a

4174.469 --> 4179.92
scene just to snit just to make contact

4176.989 --> 4182.869
or something so not a bad scene just

4179.92 --> 4191.9
bring up subjects people didn't want to

4182.869 --> 4197.889
hear about no not not going for a

4191.9 --> 4197.888999999999
carnivore diet he's a mouse key no

4214.34 --> 4219.71
it's okay alibied that is freaking

4218.57 --> 4224.36
hilarious

4219.71 --> 4228.26
that's hilarious joke I like that one he

4224.36 --> 4231.46
said he's done a bit of jiu-jitsu

4228.26 --> 4234.67
but he got arrested for anti-semitism

4231.46 --> 4234.67
that is

4259.059 --> 4262.4400000000005
a more colored

4276.36 --> 4288.28
God talking about fighting sports now

4279.369 --> 4295.21
really I just I've never been a favorite

4288.28 --> 4297.55
I don't like it well maybe maybe I do

4295.21 --> 4301.929
like it sometime it's just it's a rare

4297.55 --> 4305.1990000000005
mood very rare I'd be more inclined in

4301.929 --> 4309.3
general like I it'd be more likely for

4305.199 --> 4309.299999999999
me to get in the mood to watch soccer

4309.75 --> 4316.57
you know that could potentially draw me

4313.21 --> 4319.51
and more easily sport wise but yeah that

4316.57 --> 4326.11
that's not that doesn't happen often

4319.51 --> 4328.4800000000005
either you know for me really the only

4326.11 --> 4331.98
reason to watch sports in the first

4328.48 --> 4334.48
place these days or television would be

4331.98 --> 4338.19
because I was in the company with

4334.48 --> 4338.19
somebody that I really like doing that

4338.219 --> 4344.31
and then I can definitely get into it

4340.63 --> 4344.31
it's just not something that I do myself

4359.219 --> 4368.64
huh that is cool good servant that is

4363.33 --> 4371.54
that is funny so you kept on hearing my

4368.64 --> 4375.84
voice as you fell asleep

4371.54 --> 4378.87
that's hilarious so like my show kind of

4375.84 --> 4382.77
continued on in your dream and kind of

4378.87 --> 4384.75
virtualized that is that is really

4382.77 --> 4386.4890000000005
awesome I've had those types of

4384.75 --> 4389.43
experiences as well listening to other

4386.489 --> 4391.44
things and then falling asleep I've had

4389.43 --> 4396.42
those types of experiences falling

4391.44 --> 4398.79
asleep during class like I I've had

4396.42 --> 4402.63
weird situation where I was asleep in

4398.79 --> 4405.39
class and then I would kind of dream

4402.63 --> 4407.58
state through that and still pay

4405.39 --> 4409.9800000000005
attention and add even weird situations

4407.58 --> 4411.21
because at first when that started

4409.98 --> 4413.58
happening I didn't really know what to

4411.21 --> 4415.89
do and I woke up and I would be confused

4413.58 --> 4418.14
but then later I would kind of be

4415.89 --> 4421.08
expecting that process to happen and

4418.14 --> 4422.85
kind of utilize it pushed it and then

4421.08 --> 4426.89
when people would point out like hello

4422.85 --> 4430.8
Arwen are you sleep again I would like

4426.89 --> 4433.08
wake up in a shock and then immediately

4430.8 --> 4435.84
it's very elaborately respond to the

4433.08 --> 4437.61
question in detail proving that I did

4435.84 --> 4443.400000000001
hear it even though I was literally

4437.61 --> 4449.219
asleep that kind of [ __ ] really that I

4443.4 --> 4451.62
did that it's it's amazing it kind of

4449.219 --> 4454.35
worked and it also helped me be kind of

4451.62 --> 4456.18
rested you know because I had to get up

4454.35 --> 4458.070000000001
pretty early to on the bike through

4456.18 --> 4460.89
shitty weather to get to school and it

4458.07 --> 4463.44
would drain me but then yeah I could

4460.89 --> 4466.35
stay sleep sort of a little bit in class

4463.44 --> 4469.53
and still pay attention now this didn't

4466.35 --> 4471.870000000001
work if the teacher was not really

4469.53 --> 4474.69
passionate but most of them were were

4471.87 --> 4476.73
good enough some would not absolutely

4474.69 --> 4478.949
not tolerate it but yeah after a few

4476.73 --> 4480.78
times of actually having been almost

4478.949 --> 4483.719
half asleep and then being able to

4480.78 --> 4488.28
respond in detail they kind of let me do

4483.719 --> 4491.15
that those teachers must think I'm a

4488.28 --> 4491.15
pretty weird guy

4491.53 --> 4497.719999999999
but then again I was very forward even

4494.93 --> 4500.18
with yeah I think I have like paranormal

4497.72 --> 4503.12
type abilities I was very into that even

4500.18 --> 4503.66
back then and it was kind of forward

4503.12 --> 4506.0
with it

4503.66 --> 4507.28
so I guess everybody thought I was

4506.0 --> 4514.49
really weird

4507.28 --> 4517.849999999999
maybe I am really weird you sleep when

4514.49 --> 4520.75
rumps talks they lie Ohio Oh God that

4517.85 --> 4520.75
explains so much

4523.18 --> 4528.62
that explains too much yeah if you're

4526.76 --> 4530.24
gonna fall asleep while rumpus talks you

4528.62 --> 4533.33
know what's gonna happen right why he's

4530.24 --> 4535.91
just gonna keep on talking in your dream

4533.33 --> 4549.95
state and if you're then okay with that

4535.91 --> 4552.59
it's gonna grind into your memory if you

4549.95 --> 4556.25
dream dreamt of rumpus you'd go to the

4552.59 --> 4558.59
doctor well to be fair sometimes I kind

4556.25 --> 4561.68
of do dream about him a bit in the

4558.59 --> 4564.77
context of other things I've had dreams

4561.68 --> 4570.56
where it would be almost like a summary

4564.77 --> 4573.110000000001
of it would be like virtual puppetry I

4570.56 --> 4575.780000000001
would have an extracted version a

4573.11 --> 4577.549999999999
generalized version of each individual

4575.78 --> 4580.07
that I kind of know that typically hangs

4577.55 --> 4584.4800000000005
around like have a Reilly and a Nathan

4580.07 --> 4587.69
and you know the other characters

4584.48 --> 4590.12
chocolate saying and then it is kind of

4587.69 --> 4593.419999999999
weird how that works and then rhombic

4590.12 --> 4596.69
would also sometimes be in there even

4593.42 --> 4605.06
get in the way in that process and just

4596.69 --> 4606.98
be so I did kind of I have dreamt about

4605.06 --> 4610.990000000001
him but it would always be like AHA

4606.98 --> 4610.99
rhombuses rumpa thing again

4632.28 --> 4638.87
ile le me that's just disgusting sorry

4666.27 --> 4674.660000000001
really Bailey Ohio if I got stuck in a

4669.84 --> 4674.66
room with rumpus I just leave

4688.019 --> 4692.159000000001
or what could kind of work because I

4690.389 --> 4694.8
don't think that rumpus is a guy that

4692.159 --> 4700.11
talks to himself so if you just

4694.8 --> 4702.21
completely just go non-responsive which

4700.11 --> 4704.639
yeah when you mute yours when you don't

4702.21 --> 4706.26
talk in chat you don't see it but when

4704.639 --> 4710.9890000000005
you're actively with someone in the room

4706.26 --> 4714.599
and you just go catatonic like actively

4710.989 --> 4716.308999999999
people are gonna shut up if there's one

4714.599 --> 4718.159000000001
other person they're not gonna continue

4716.309 --> 4722.01
rattling no matter who they are

4718.159 --> 4724.619
okay that's how that works it doesn't

4722.01 --> 4728.1900000000005
work over the Internet though unless you

4724.619 --> 4730.86
have a visual of your presence at the

4728.19 --> 4733.219
same time accompanying the communication

4730.86 --> 4733.219
over the Internet

4735.019 --> 4740.21
Rumplestiltskin yeah yeah Hannah koala

4737.88 --> 4743.07
you know I called him rump instead

4740.21 --> 4749.76
Rumplestiltskin like even three years

4743.07 --> 4753.599
ago I was naming that in the first year

4749.76 --> 4760.92
of the debates and before that even I

4753.599 --> 4763.55
think Rumplestiltskin yeah it's tearing

4760.92 --> 4763.55
himself apart

4770.07 --> 4777.2
ah DANC

4771.8 --> 4777.2
why do you guys have to get so gross

4782.79 --> 4795.36
serious it's like I I recommend not

4790.99 --> 4795.36
talking like that at the breakfast table

4798.05 --> 4801.249
[Music]

4814.29 --> 4821.29
is a mouse key well what makes you think

4817.86 --> 4823.799999999999
rumpus has a next extensive internal

4821.29 --> 4823.8
dialogue

4835.939 --> 4842.039000000001
just because somebody talks continually

4839.189 --> 4847.979
when they talk doesn't mean that they

4842.039 --> 4849.839
have inner dialogue a lot on average it

4847.979 --> 4851.4890000000005
usually tends to be quite the opposite

4849.839 --> 4854.28
actually people that have extensive

4851.489 --> 4863.549999999999
inner dialogue tend to not be so

4854.28 --> 4865.379
communicative to the outside world now I

4863.55 --> 4869.729
don't know rumpus in real life but I

4865.379 --> 4872.989
have been subjected to him for years now

4869.729 --> 4877.889
have studied him I find him fascinating

4872.989 --> 4881.28
as a character it's a person so I do

4877.889 --> 4885.51
feel that I do know him also thanks to

4881.28 --> 4888.239
my senses but I haven't met him face to

4885.51 --> 4891.149
face no not even sure if that picture

4888.239 --> 4893.489
that he always uses is actually him I've

4891.149 --> 4900.979
never seen him move he's never shown his

4893.489 --> 4903.749
face as far as I know but his voice is

4900.979 --> 4906.769
unmistakable it is what that one

4903.749 --> 4906.769
individual for sure

4911.89 --> 4918.06
well mark Collard who knows maybe that

4914.32 --> 4920.74
is him when he was like in his prime

4918.06 --> 4924.76
who knows maybe he's kind of like a fat

4920.74 --> 4926.679999999999
guy now I don't know I have no idea what

4924.76 --> 4928.75
rumpus really looks like right now but

4926.68 --> 4940.66
it could that picture he used could be

4928.75 --> 4942.58
him but from some time ago oh yeah by

4940.66 --> 4944.83
the way I watched the another movie yes

4942.58 --> 4947.58
the movie that I was gonna watch turn

4944.83 --> 4957.37
out to be awesome I was so impressed

4947.58 --> 4961.54
it was a what's again yeah Adam Sandler

4957.37 --> 4963.97
movie it was click it's called click but

4961.54 --> 4967.2699999999995
it's a very silly conceptual movie in a

4963.97 --> 4971.47
way it's a comedy movie but also very

4967.27 --> 4974.77
drama it is really very heartfelt life

4971.47 --> 4977.62
lesson and it got me crying literally at

4974.77 --> 4980.4400000000005
some scenes like it got me laughing

4977.62 --> 4983.25
model but it like got me crying hard at

4980.44 --> 4987.28
certain scenes because it was just so

4983.25 --> 4989.25
palpable so I yeah the movie it's also

4987.28 --> 4996.509999999999
it has what's his name again

4989.25 --> 4999.25
that that's really silly actor so funny

4996.51 --> 5004.110000000001
but anyway it's a movie on Netflix I

4999.25 --> 5006.36
thought it was awesome is it an older

5004.11 --> 5013.98
movie could be they had like this

5006.36 --> 5017.58
fantasy of 2021 it was I really like

5013.98 --> 5019.589999999999
this movie I've never seen it before on

5017.58 --> 5023.19
the surface it looks just really silly

5019.59 --> 5028.41
but it is amazingly heartfelt the things

5023.19 --> 5030.7699999999995
that happen in there yeah David

5028.41 --> 5035.5199999999995
Hasselhoff is in it as well yeah yeah

5030.77 --> 5037.530000000001
yes it's a really interesting movie 2006

5035.52 --> 5041.52
right right I have never seen it before

5037.53 --> 5043.23
I just missed out hey thank you good

5041.52 --> 5046.25
serving for the dollar super jet

5043.23 --> 5046.25
donation thanks buddy

5051.73 --> 5059.169999999999
well George Sanford it turns out it's a

5054.1 --> 5065.530000000001
13 year well 14 years old now probably

5059.17 --> 5068.86
13 13 1/2 but yeah that just goes to

5065.53 --> 5071.5599999999995
show you know it it's not bad to just

5068.86 --> 5075.19
miss out on what is being pumped out in

5071.56 --> 5076.51
at the moment in movie land because ya

5075.19 --> 5078.61
later you could just figure it'll oh

5076.51 --> 5085.06
what's this a movie that I've never seen

5078.61 --> 5087.94
before awesome you know so yeah I'm not

5085.06 --> 5090.370000000001
sad that I didn't become like a movie

5087.94 --> 5093.879999999999
freak and had to see every single movie

5090.37 --> 5096.69
when it comes out move that would be too

5093.88 --> 5096.6900000000005
expensive anyway

5104.62 --> 5108.37
even older right

5110.659 --> 5117.71
yeah mark color David is I don't know

5114.76 --> 5125.77
David house off is just really into

5117.71 --> 5125.77
being himself I don't know

5136.519 --> 5143.63
alright I'll mark colored another movie

5140.26 --> 5146.3
it's a good movie I really think it is a

5143.63 --> 5148.519
good movie so if you've never seen it

5146.3 --> 5151.13
that just go watch it and the other

5148.519 --> 5159.2300000000005
movie I watched yesterday yes man is

5151.13 --> 5162.8
also it was a blast yeah maybe this this

5159.23 --> 5166.098999999999
movement yeah no it was yeah good in

5162.8 --> 5168.289
another way Jim Carrey way I hope to

5166.099 --> 5170.679
find some more of these interesting

5168.289 --> 5170.679
movies

5177.409 --> 5181.219
but yeah unfortunately it's all gonna

5179.36 --> 5189.79
have to be unmet flicks though because

5181.219 --> 5189.79
don't have any other sources all right

5202.64 --> 5208.85
right well mark colored it's difficult

5206.02 --> 5217.67
movies were better before CGI was a big

5208.85 --> 5220.85
thing well there's something to say

5217.67 --> 5226.36
about practical effects the weird thing

5220.85 --> 5232.070000000001
is about practical effect shots somehow

5226.36 --> 5233.99
have a mystical extra value to them like

5232.07 --> 5235.61
practical it is really true it is

5233.99 --> 5237.62
noticeable like even if you look back at

5235.61 --> 5240.83
older stuff and you see the practical

5237.62 --> 5243.86
effect it's just like wow that's cool

5240.83 --> 5246.29
and with CGI that never happens really

5243.86 --> 5248.929999999999
the only thing you really remember it

5246.29 --> 5250.85
actually goes the other way the

5248.93 --> 5253.25
impression degrades and you might

5250.85 --> 5255.68
remember how much it impressed you at

5253.25 --> 5257.84
first but it doesn't it will never

5255.68 --> 5259.43
impress you as much again well with

5257.84 --> 5262.16
practical effects it seems to be quite

5259.43 --> 5265.31
the opposite it's exactly the opposite

5262.16 --> 5265.3099999999995
[Music]

5265.36 --> 5274.849999999999
okay Eternal Sunshine of the spotless

5269.42 --> 5278.26
mind new sounds a bit arrogant but I'll

5274.85 --> 5278.26
look it up thanks for the tip

5289.83 --> 5297.899
and now it's now Netflix unfortunately

5293.09 --> 5297.899
[Music]

5314.969 --> 5320.729
right

5317.459 --> 5323.039
yeah oh and also more colored it's not

5320.729 --> 5328.320000000001
the end of it though you know CGI

5323.039 --> 5331.768999999999
because CGI is kind of like a filler

5328.32 --> 5334.139
it's a paint filler to get the suspense

5331.769 --> 5337.439
of disbelief

5334.139 --> 5340.499
the thing that is imagined keep it going

5337.439 --> 5342.389
but if there are the practical things

5340.499 --> 5345.209
that are there that can be the actors it

5342.389 --> 5347.789
can be some props that are physical if

5345.209 --> 5353.67
those are really done passionately

5347.789 --> 5356.239
really well then that CGI doesn't it's

5353.67 --> 5358.889
not as bad

5356.239 --> 5366.989
like the goodness of the real things

5358.889 --> 5369.479
actually in a way can rub off on CGI but

5366.989 --> 5371.789
it's wait the yeah again the the real

5369.479 --> 5374.400000000001
valuable energy always comes from the

5371.789 --> 5377.119
real physical effects from the real

5374.4 --> 5382.159
physical acting from the actual passion

5377.119 --> 5382.159
because she can't CGI that not really

5398.91 --> 5409.349999999999
you know think of it like this which

5401.49 --> 5411.66
movie was it it's like really old Disney

5409.35 --> 5415.77
movies where they had physical people

5411.66 --> 5422.34
walking around in a cartoon world well

5415.77 --> 5425.34
that is kind of CGI - you know what's

5422.34 --> 5427.08
not computer it's still hand-drawn so

5425.34 --> 5429.900000000001
that it is kind of different but in a

5427.08 --> 5433.94
way it is kind of step in between but

5429.9 --> 5436.7
hey if the story is kind of good and the

5433.94 --> 5439.74
actors are really into it really

5436.7 --> 5444.96
radiating a lot of happy energy and all

5439.74 --> 5446.55
that then it works because of that and

5444.96 --> 5451.2300000000005
that is also a bit of the problem now

5446.55 --> 5453.63
with modern-day film industries is that

5451.23 --> 5456.839999999999
because of the well seemingly mass

5453.63 --> 5460.86
production of things and the well the

5456.84 --> 5464.28
wide range of CGI options that I don't

5460.86 --> 5467.16
know it seems like it's much more tough

5464.28 --> 5470.55
for actors to stay really into it or

5467.16 --> 5472.53
passionate and that that it that is

5470.55 --> 5475.56
noticeable that's really a modern

5472.53 --> 5478.009999999999
problem with movies in the old days all

5475.56 --> 5481.530000000001
those movies and all that was much rarer

5478.01 --> 5485.88
it wasn't as tainted also by politics as

5481.53 --> 5489.09
much or not visibly as much or it was

5485.88 --> 5491.46
still nice it was still fresh so the

5489.09 --> 5495.27
actors were all very enthusiastic or

5491.46 --> 5499.47
most of the time or anyway there's more

5495.27 --> 5501.030000000001
energy and now it's tougher it's tough

5499.47 --> 5503.01
to get that author and there's still

5501.03 --> 5507.0599999999995
some really good actors that just have

5503.01 --> 5512.31
character but on average no it's it's

5507.06 --> 5516.26
dim down but it's an industrial side

5512.31 --> 5520.9800000000005
effect it's the problem of too much and

5516.26 --> 5522.87
too easy in a way and that dims down the

5520.98 --> 5525.86
enthusiasm of the actors it's a

5522.87 --> 5525.86
universal problem

5534.539 --> 5543.969
right mark : yeah yeah but simple you

5538.449 --> 5549.94
can't establish a connection with the

5543.969 --> 5553.09
CGI actor you can't establish that

5549.94 --> 5555.489
spiritual connection because that is

5553.09 --> 5557.889
there it's like an extra layer upon

5555.489 --> 5562.9
reality that your senses only pick up

5557.889 --> 5566.219
and it even remains in photographs that

5562.9 --> 5569.018999999999
print remains in photographs of people

5566.219 --> 5571.96
like how they felt at the time what

5569.019 --> 5574.42
they're like at the time but if it's CGI

5571.96 --> 5577.2390000000005
then none of that energy is there even

5574.42 --> 5580.21
though it was really subtracted from an

5577.239 --> 5583.119
actual person doesn't matter because

5580.21 --> 5588.039
it's not the literal energy prints

5583.119 --> 5591.21
that's been recorded so you don't get

5588.039 --> 5591.21
that connection anymore

5596.92 --> 5605.62
and now that can be compensated with

5599.86 --> 5607.9
with mimicry just emphasizing the the

5605.62 --> 5611.14
feeling specifically a social structure

5607.9 --> 5613.299999999999
is yeah it can be emulated but it's

5611.14 --> 5616.42
gonna be based on mimicry not on the

5613.3 --> 5621.7
actual energy of the of the real-life

5616.42 --> 5627.49
individual yeah well that's what you see

5621.7 --> 5630.94
in CGI in CGI pure of CGI movies anyway

5627.49 --> 5635.19
it is I'm not an expert in these things

5630.94 --> 5638.11
anyway just I've taken notice of that I

5635.19 --> 5642.129999999999
don't really like all CGI cartoons I

5638.11 --> 5646.469999999999
rarely do because I don't know I just

5642.13 --> 5646.47
find real people a lot more interesting

5654.379 --> 5660.26
but maybe that's because I'm just almost

5656.809 --> 5665.84
40 years old and maybe it's just maybe

5660.26 --> 5668.629
it's something for the youth I don't

5665.84 --> 5670.34
know if the youth has this type of

5668.629 --> 5672.8
insight with people or if they are

5670.34 --> 5675.229
capable of dealing with it or realizing

5672.8 --> 5680.709
it or if that just comes later on she'll

5675.229 --> 5680.709
grow all their as you mature not sure

5687.12 --> 5689.84
it's

5692.329 --> 5700.61
right Roger Rabbit there was another one

5696.07 --> 5704.2699999999995
yeah I'd like to Roger Rabbit but it

5700.61 --> 5708.86
worked because of the live actors it

5704.27 --> 5714.8
they were into it and that made it work

5708.86 --> 5717.44
and it's kind of like the visuals tried

5714.8 --> 5719.659000000001
to do their mimicry wizardry on purpose

5717.44 --> 5724.129999999999
but at the same time it would also

5719.659 --> 5727.308999999999
properly reflect the actual actor their

5724.13 --> 5729.409000000001
energy it was a well fine-tuned movie

5727.309 --> 5732.619000000001
there was a real visionary on top of

5729.409 --> 5741.11
that movie that really knows about

5732.619 --> 5742.25
sensories it was brilliant and that

5741.11 --> 5745.03
actor was amazing

5742.25 --> 5745.03
the delete'

5765.88 --> 5770.6900000000005
well David Howard I don't know I don't

5769.13 --> 5773.53
know where the funding is coming from it

5770.69 --> 5776.45
could just be liberal mega corporate

5773.53 --> 5784.719999999999
finance years that are voluntary to have

5776.45 --> 5788.0599999999995
a fun to do that or I don't know maybe

5784.72 --> 5789.85
that's just you know there there could

5788.06 --> 5792.9800000000005
be something to it that they they're

5789.85 --> 5794.870000000001
genuinely advertising because they it's

5792.98 --> 5799.429999999999
just widely known that there is a lot of

5794.87 --> 5802.82
ballers and people out there that get on

5799.43 --> 5805.34
our asses and track our every move to

5802.82 --> 5807.71
see if we muck up something or get

5805.34 --> 5809.06
obsessed it's like a general thing so

5807.71 --> 5810.9800000000005
maybe they're just literally putting

5809.06 --> 5813.860000000001
advertisement for those people out there

5810.98 --> 5816.379999999999
like hey maybe there's something maybe

5813.86 --> 5819.83
you could just get into your belief and

5816.38 --> 5822.29
just get into that and kind of stop

5819.83 --> 5824.2699999999995
obsessing over flat everything maybe

5822.29 --> 5828.11
that's why did I do it I don't know man

5824.27 --> 5830.660000000001
I did it out but yeah the neil degrasse

5828.11 --> 5836.62
tyson ads have been all over that all

5830.66 --> 5836.62
over the place indeed all over our place

5840.19 --> 5849.7699999999995
my show is tracked by the feds of course

5842.87 --> 5852.44
it is absolutely well not not like oh

5849.77 --> 5854.540000000001
there's some people literally on my case

5852.44 --> 5856.37
or any I don't have a case you know the

5854.54 --> 5859.13
only case I have is my activity here

5856.37 --> 5865.37
because I have a clean record never done

5859.13 --> 5869.24
anything illegal that's been registered

5865.37 --> 5874.16
or somebody could hold against me I

5869.24 --> 5875.33
think well not that I know of a lot of

5874.16 --> 5880.93
things that I thought had happened

5875.33 --> 5880.93
turned out to be not real so

5883.26 --> 5887.9400000000005
[Music]

5888.94 --> 5894.679999999999
but yeah I'm pretty sure they're aware

5891.68 --> 5897.41
that there is an Arwen livestreaming guy

5894.68 --> 5902.63
from the Netherlands that good at

5897.41 --> 5906.0199999999995
English ins like like kind of an

5902.63 --> 5907.37
American file or how do you call it they

5906.02 --> 5909.46
would probably regard me like that

5907.37 --> 5915.44
because they do sympathize a lot with

5909.46 --> 5917.75
Americans and usually you know in the

5915.44 --> 5920.9
Netherlands in general there's not a lot

5917.75 --> 5927.92
of sympathy for Americans they're all

5920.9 --> 5932.15
very liberal mmm that's it I don't think

5927.92 --> 5934.7
there I got a red flag or anything no

5932.15 --> 5937.37
but I wonder sometimes even like who lit

5934.7 --> 5941.51
who really does listen to me I really

5937.37 --> 5943.76
wonder if like these or is it these

5941.51 --> 5946.1900000000005
mechanics technicians that are like

5943.76 --> 5949.43
secret projecting are they listening to

5946.19 --> 5951.139999999999
me as well because I really try to be on

5949.43 --> 5953.75
the edge of actually insights with

5951.14 --> 5958.450000000001
things and I try to unravel concepts and

5953.75 --> 5961.55
I there should be more people out there

5958.45 --> 5963.5
that would actually get what I'm talking

5961.55 --> 5967.33
about or what I'm at least trying to say

5963.5 --> 5970.88
rather quickly unlike a lot of people

5967.33 --> 5972.65
that need a lot of time to figure out

5970.88 --> 5974.18
what the hell I'm talking about half of

5972.65 --> 5976.4
the time especially concerning their

5974.18 --> 5978.860000000001
like rectangular looping model or even

5976.4 --> 5981.549999999999
the nature of Lights the nature of light

5978.86 --> 5986.69
thing is a very complex issue that just

5981.55 --> 5988.91
I've come to terms with that yeah the

5986.69 --> 5990.71
majority of people are just never gonna

5988.91 --> 5994.28
get that they're just not gonna be able

5990.71 --> 5997.64
to understand what I'm what the hassle

5994.28 --> 6000.94
is about but that doesn't mean that

5997.64 --> 6003.610000000001
nobody will and I just wonder out that

6000.94 --> 6006.3099999999995
like are there other people maybe in

6003.61 --> 6008.349999999999
some science the research community or

6006.31 --> 6013.2300000000005
whatever that do kind of keep track I

6008.35 --> 6019.5
don't know I in a way I do hope so

6013.23 --> 6022.5
because I do want my knowledge to be

6019.5 --> 6022.5
useful

6026.239 --> 6034.218999999999
I want progress progress in truth and

6030.219 --> 6038.63
Sensibility in balance like I want it

6034.219 --> 6041.68
all good as good as it possible it can

6038.63 --> 6046.37
never be perfect but it could be

6041.68 --> 6049.01
imperfect in the most optimal potential

6046.37 --> 6053.239
way and that's even yeah figuring that

6049.01 --> 6056.2390000000005
out never perfectly balanced but always

6053.239 --> 6059.95
as balanced as possible never perfect

6056.239 --> 6059.95
but always as perfect as possible

6062.2 --> 6065.2699999999995
[Music]

6078.63 --> 6086.159000000001
yeah I know good servant yeah but right

6081.03 --> 6091.199
the hand has he has some potential it's

6086.159 --> 6097.829
just so much problem social issues on

6091.199 --> 6101.159
top of that it's just it's not very good

6097.829 --> 6103.199
in cooperating with people yeah and

6101.159 --> 6105.03
we've all experienced that by now but

6103.199 --> 6108.36
that doesn't mean that he doesn't have

6105.03 --> 6112.94
some actual brains concerning the

6108.36 --> 6118.53
mechanics and sharpness of view inside

6112.94 --> 6122.549999999999
he has some talent so I think that his

6118.53 --> 6125.579
main challenge is to just kind of deal

6122.55 --> 6129.27
with the the feeling and the social

6125.579 --> 6132.03
interaction issues just find another way

6129.27 --> 6134.4890000000005
find another way to do I I I kind of

6132.03 --> 6136.17
believed he could do it but it is tough

6134.489 --> 6139.82
it's not gonna be easy

6136.17 --> 6143.07
you know that [ __ ] is really tough but

6139.82 --> 6148.799999999999
he has some spirit I just hope he can

6143.07 --> 6153.929
deflect the spirit from senseless social

6148.8 --> 6158.01
malarkey to discipline in the exact

6153.929 --> 6164.099
right approach and bottom-up just being

6158.01 --> 6166.34
strong instead of being aggressive we'll

6164.099 --> 6166.34
see

6174.78 --> 6183.09
yeah well good servant we're working on

6180.94 --> 6183.089999999999
it

6192.809 --> 6202.92
I know mark colored it is incredibly

6195.27 --> 6207.150000000001
embarrassing but hey people can do

6202.92 --> 6210.27
incredibly dumb things even for a

6207.15 --> 6211.829
prolonged period you know what are you

6210.27 --> 6215.4890000000005
gonna do you're just gonna tell them now

6211.829 --> 6217.53
you just stay like that forever or maybe

6215.489 --> 6223.138999999999
there's a way to change that and then

6217.53 --> 6228.509999999999
kind of try to reconciliate with past

6223.139 --> 6233.9890000000005
transgressions in the past and I'm a

6228.51 --> 6233.9890000000005
very forgiving guy but you can't fake

6234.829 --> 6241.199
you can't fake growth you can't fake it

6238.739 --> 6242.909
can't pretend it has to be real it has

6241.199 --> 6249.089999999999
to come from then they have to decide it

6242.909 --> 6252.239
I can only give hopefully give them the

6249.09 --> 6259.650000000001
spark of hope or a way through somehow

6252.239 --> 6262.049999999999
that's it right but I'm gonna round out

6259.65 --> 6269.339999999999
