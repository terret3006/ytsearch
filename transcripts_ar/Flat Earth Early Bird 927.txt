they'll be much appreciated so

106.079 --> 111.19999999999999
well as you can already see it's

112.84 --> 120.0
hot

115.04 --> 120.0
wires are getting mixed up here

120.079 --> 126.719
i've got my fan here but yeah i'm not

123.68 --> 130.239
turning that on but

126.719 --> 131.51999999999998
it's pretty clear blue but there's a lot

130.239 --> 135.52
of moist in the air

131.52 --> 135.52
it was even a bit clouded earlier

135.84 --> 142.48
pretty much up until half an hour ago

139.28 --> 145.76
it was actually kind of clouded but

142.48 --> 150.959
despite that it was just so unbelievably

145.76 --> 154.959
hot probably also because it's moist

150.959 --> 158.4
that yeah

154.959 --> 158.4
he is getting a bit to me

161.44 --> 164.48
like when i i did go out for some

163.44 --> 168.16
groceries we got

164.48 --> 170.23899999999998
because i did still get up pretty early

168.16 --> 171.68
when i came back i had like this whole

170.239 --> 174.959
sweating fit it was

171.68 --> 174.959
extremely annoying

177.12 --> 180.48000000000002
just wouldn't stop sweating

180.56 --> 185.2
right so i hope that yeah like in the

184.0 --> 187.36
next

185.2 --> 188.56
30 minutes the sun will stop hitting the

187.36 --> 190.4
wall here and it'll

188.56 --> 193.36
become a little bit more bearable

190.4 --> 193.36
temperature wise

196.4 --> 199.84
because it's just so hot

200.159 --> 204.879
let me check what the temperature is

202.319 --> 204.879
officially

205.36 --> 212.87900000000002
29 degrees holy [ __ ] okay

208.959 --> 215.76
yeah that's certainly the warmest it has

212.879 --> 215.76
been so far

216.0 --> 219.92
this summer here in the netherlands

220.0 --> 222.239
oh

224.0 --> 228.08
that is because like even getting out

226.64 --> 231.44
there on the bicycle

228.08 --> 234.64000000000001
just in shorts and a t-shirt

231.44 --> 237.439
it was still like too hot

234.64 --> 238.319
but again like the moist probably a big

237.439 --> 239.68
factor in that

238.319 --> 242.48
because then it doesn't really matter

239.68 --> 246.08
what what you're wearing or not wearing

242.48 --> 246.07999999999998
it's just warm no matter what

247.92 --> 257.84
right so anyway it's

252.319 --> 257.84
thursday the 17th of june 2021

264.8 --> 271.6
and yeah

269.199 --> 274.24
yesterday certainly gave me a lot to

271.6 --> 274.24
think about

277.17 --> 283.84000000000003
[Music]

279.68 --> 283.84000000000003
also i was kind of surprised because

284.16 --> 288.08000000000004
during that show yesterday i kind of

286.16 --> 291.44
like openly

288.08 --> 294.8
requested through the ether

291.44 --> 294.8
through the social media

294.88 --> 302.15999999999997
if owen benjamin could like

298.4 --> 305.67999999999995
what would he think about my idea

302.16 --> 306.88000000000005
right and well it happens to turn out to

305.68 --> 309.28000000000003
be

306.88 --> 310.0
turns out to be that he had a stream

309.28 --> 314.4
very early

310.0 --> 317.759
that day and it was all about

314.4 --> 321.039
theology again and

317.759 --> 324.16
even though he didn't address anything

321.039 --> 326.639
that i said specifically in that setting

324.16 --> 328.639
he did all get into the trinity again

326.639 --> 330.639
and

328.639 --> 333.919
i don't know maybe it was just yesterday

330.639 --> 333.919
was such a day

334.4 --> 339.52
where these types of questions that type

337.039 --> 342.8
of thinking

339.52 --> 344.56
wells up i had it and maybe owen

342.8 --> 347.6
benjamin had it

344.56 --> 352.32
i'm not sure yet but that

347.6 --> 354.24
it certainly gave me that that sense

352.32 --> 357.36
so yeah yesterday's own benjamin was

354.24 --> 357.36
really fascinating

364.4 --> 367.84
it's so hot

376.0 --> 382.56
right also watch the movie

379.68 --> 383.919
hulk just hulk i didn't see that one

382.56 --> 386.8
before

383.919 --> 387.68
some reason only sold the incredible

386.8 --> 389.68
hulk

387.68 --> 391.919
though this one was completely different

389.68 --> 393.68
it was like a

391.919 --> 395.68
what was really about genetic

393.68 --> 399.919
engineering in that sense it was kind of

395.68 --> 399.919
a creepy movie from 2005

400.08 --> 405.68
but it seemed much

403.199 --> 407.68
more thought out it was much more of a

405.68 --> 410.96
science fiction

407.68 --> 414.16
really it was like the hulk story

410.96 --> 415.12
but more carefully worked out in the

414.16 --> 417.52000000000004
science fiction

415.12 --> 418.639
setup and i thought that like the

417.52 --> 421.68
mechanics

418.639 --> 424.16
of the story were actually really

421.68 --> 424.16
interesting

428.44 --> 433.36
[Music]

431.28 --> 435.44
hey tom parker first and chad good to

433.36 --> 438.96000000000004
see you

435.44 --> 441.039
hashtag leave hot indeed

438.96 --> 443.44
get some of this water that's all i got

441.039 --> 443.44
today

447.12 --> 453.599
put it in the fridge half an hour before

450.96 --> 453.599
i went live

456.16 --> 465.84000000000003
so it's still nice and cool

466.16 --> 474.24
yeah it is tom parker 29 degrees celsius

470.4 --> 479.84
it's really hot it's also kind of moist

474.24 --> 479.84000000000003
so that yeah that compounds the effect

488.56 --> 492.24
also a bit of a restless mood which

491.52 --> 494.639
typically

492.24 --> 496.72
also tends to arrive it's either super

494.639 --> 498.56
relaxing and like

496.72 --> 499.91900000000004
just mellowing around or it's

498.56 --> 501.759
restlessness

499.919 --> 504.639
when it's this type of tropical weather

501.759 --> 508.319
it's always one of the two for me

504.639 --> 508.319
this time i'm kind of restless

509.12 --> 514.24
oh at least i did get a pretty decent

511.52 --> 521.8389999999999
rest this night

514.24 --> 521.839
despite it getting pretty late

524.0 --> 531.92
right i was watching

527.36 --> 536.399
a big chunk of a video that good servant

531.92 --> 536.399
yeah link me up with in skype

539.6 --> 542.72
reposted it too

543.76 --> 549.8389999999999
wait where is it

558.08 --> 565.44
huh right anyway i will repost it

562.88 --> 567.12
in the blueberry skype chat and also in

565.44 --> 569.9200000000001
here if you want to take a look it's a

567.12 --> 573.2
five freaking hour video though

569.92 --> 576.16
but the first hour was

573.2 --> 579.519
really fascinating to me because it was

576.16 --> 583.6
basically about the mud flood

579.519 --> 585.839
and details were pointed out to me that

583.6 --> 587.9200000000001
might have roughly bumped into but this

585.839 --> 589.2790000000001
time it was really brought in a cohesive

587.92 --> 592.56
fashion and that just

589.279 --> 594.48
really it's really shocking

592.56 --> 595.76
when you put all that stuff just

594.48 --> 599.36
together

595.76 --> 601.68
in a kind of a clear setting so i

599.36 --> 603.36
basically agreed with a lot of what he

601.68 --> 606.8
said it's like that's

603.36 --> 607.2
how i see it as well but then inserted

606.8 --> 611.04
other

607.2 --> 613.12
weird things like

611.04 --> 614.3199999999999
the idea that at some point there may

613.12 --> 616.9590000000001
have been just like

614.32 --> 619.519
well coinciding with this reset and the

616.959 --> 619.5189999999999
mudflap

619.76 --> 623.279
coinciding correlatory right not

622.399 --> 626.959
necessarily

623.279 --> 630.399
specifically because that there were a

626.959 --> 630.399
whole bunch of kids

630.88 --> 636.64
being redistributed around the world as

634.079 --> 636.64
orphans

637.44 --> 644.9590000000001
as it's like repopulating and then

641.76 --> 649.12
like yeah laying that next to the the

644.959 --> 652.2399999999999
old old photographs that a martin shows

649.12 --> 656.079
of completely empty mega cities

652.24 --> 660.399
like mega cities

656.079 --> 664.8
huge and yeah they were basically

660.399 --> 667.68
reseeded receded with population

664.8 --> 668.24
and even like he put so many things

667.68 --> 672.8
together

668.24 --> 672.8
in that first chunk of the of his video

673.12 --> 680.72
that yeah there were a lot of orphan

676.64 --> 685.04
stories popularized in that time period

680.72 --> 687.9590000000001
well if there's a whole bunch of people

685.04 --> 689.12
that are orphans that are growing up in

687.959 --> 692.64
workhouses

689.12 --> 694.399
and just getting their [ __ ] together

692.64 --> 697.519
maybe even succeeding

694.399 --> 700.64
eventually or whatever that

697.519 --> 701.04
that would be popularized but it's just

700.64 --> 704.16
that

701.04 --> 706.079
the orphans were not because oh the the

704.16 --> 706.399
parents died and then they were adopted

706.079 --> 710.079
no

706.399 --> 710.079
there was something else going on

710.16 --> 715.519
probably a whole bunch of men died maybe

713.279 --> 716.959
through the wars or something else it's

715.519 --> 719.279
not entirely clear

716.959 --> 722.079
there were still wars right there in the

719.279 --> 724.399
19th century

722.079 --> 726.16
and then just a whole bunch of kids got

724.399 --> 730.32
it redistributed

726.16 --> 733.68
from around the world

730.32 --> 735.2
recede instead of just like oh no just a

733.68 --> 738.079
whole bunch of orphans

735.2 --> 738.0790000000001
by accident

740.72 --> 746.48
it was quite shocking

744.32 --> 749.36
to have it to see it all put together in

746.48 --> 749.36
that context

749.519 --> 754.24
the thought had not occurred to me

751.839 --> 756.72
before

754.24 --> 759.839
right so that was kind of on my mind too

756.72 --> 759.839
this morning

773.519 --> 779.519
and yeah it touches upon a whole range

777.36 --> 782.639
of ideas that i don't normally

779.519 --> 785.2
share like i keep it to myself i

782.639 --> 786.16
i'm trying to figure it out myself

785.2 --> 789.44
because they make me

786.16 --> 789.4399999999999
very uncomfortable

795.44 --> 803.7600000000001
made me think about it again

800.16 --> 806.7199999999999
like who the freak built those things

803.76 --> 809.04
how were they built by an original

806.72 --> 812.0790000000001
population

809.04 --> 815.68
or were they like a post

812.079 --> 818.88
mass death recreation

815.68 --> 821.68
somehow like sometimes i just get the

818.88 --> 821.68
idea like did

825.199 --> 828.079
like what

832.399 --> 838.16
even if you try to figure out okay they

835.6 --> 838.48
probably had stone molding techniques

838.16 --> 841.6
and

838.48 --> 845.1990000000001
all kinds of very clever

841.6 --> 848.8000000000001
advances but still

845.199 --> 851.519
it would require a lot of people

848.8 --> 853.4399999999999
it's just i don't know how they could

851.519 --> 854.48
have all put it together with what was

853.44 --> 856.48
around

854.48 --> 858.0790000000001
so is there something freaky

856.48 --> 861.6800000000001
supernatural going on

858.079 --> 861.68
it's been suggested before

862.24 --> 871.839
makes me nervous

872.079 --> 876.8
exposure rates around 20 minutes back

874.56 --> 876.8
then

878.079 --> 882.8389999999999
well yes george sanford i thought about

880.48 --> 885.519
that as well

882.839 --> 888.9590000000001
but if it is

885.519 --> 889.839
literally an analog photograph of 20

888.959 --> 892.0
minutes right

889.839 --> 893.1990000000001
because digital that's something else of

892.0 --> 896.399
course

893.199 --> 898.4799999999999
and it's supposed to be analog well if

896.399 --> 900.0
there's people around

898.48 --> 902.0
yeah it's very unlikely they're going to

900.0 --> 903.92
stand still in exactly the same position

902.0 --> 906.48
for 20 minutes

903.92 --> 907.36
but it's not unlikely that some would

906.48 --> 911.1990000000001
stand around

907.36 --> 914.399
somewhere sometime and there would be

911.199 --> 917.92
shades there would

914.399 --> 921.36
be shades there would still be

917.92 --> 922.7199999999999
anomalies indications like there are

921.36 --> 924.8000000000001
people around that might

922.72 --> 926.0790000000001
be interpreted as ghosts or something

924.8 --> 929.12
weird is going on right

926.079 --> 931.12
well that's not there either

929.12 --> 932.16
so unless you want to suggest that it

931.12 --> 936.9590000000001
was

932.16 --> 936.959
like airbrushed out somehow afterward

938.399 --> 942.639
i don't think that just saying long

940.88 --> 945.04
exposure

942.639 --> 947.36
is the reason why these cities are all

945.04 --> 947.36
empty

947.68 --> 954.0
besides there's photographs of later

950.72 --> 958.0790000000001
where they're not empty right

954.0 --> 960.32
and that's not like 50 years later

958.079 --> 960.3199999999999
so

963.519 --> 967.12
yeah george center percent person would

965.519 --> 970.8
have to stand still

967.12 --> 974.8
to be in the picture in a consistent

970.8 --> 976.8
visible clear focused way

974.8 --> 978.0
that's right in order for the camera to

976.8 --> 980.079
have to burn

978.0 --> 981.68
the image specifically like that yeah

980.079 --> 984.6389999999999
you would have to stand still

981.68 --> 986.3199999999999
but that doesn't mean look there is

984.639 --> 988.16
literally open analog

986.32 --> 989.519
exposure for that period so if people

988.16 --> 994.24
are gonna walk through

989.519 --> 997.759
carriages anything there's gonna be

994.24 --> 1000.24
a veil of it there will

997.759 --> 1002.8000000000001
be a veil there will be some kind of

1000.24 --> 1002.8
contrast

1003.44 --> 1011.839
so i yeah it's not it's not good enough

1021.12 --> 1025.839
right i'm just saying

1030.48 --> 1035.439
look if you can see basically take one

1034.079 --> 1037.52
of these photos at

1035.439 --> 1038.72
high res is possible and then start

1037.52 --> 1041.52
pointing like see

1038.72 --> 1043.28
here's here's the shadow there's

1041.52 --> 1045.839
probably been a few people

1043.28 --> 1046.3999999999999
walking exactly here and that's why this

1045.839 --> 1049.2
piece

1046.4 --> 1050.88
seems to be a little darker blurred than

1049.2 --> 1052.0800000000002
everything else even though it's all the

1050.88 --> 1054.3200000000002
same color

1052.08 --> 1054.32
right

1057.2 --> 1063.039
why don't we get serious instead of just

1059.919 --> 1066.72
looking for that one excuse

1063.039 --> 1070.0
oh the skeptic exit oh but i can think

1066.72 --> 1073.1200000000001
very primitively of a

1070.0 --> 1074.559
reasonably logical solution so that

1073.12 --> 1077.76
solves all of it

1074.559 --> 1081.039
now oh now it's all nothing no no no no

1077.76 --> 1082.559
no i already thought of that george

1081.039 --> 1086.559
santa

1082.559 --> 1088.48
right i know about open exposure

1086.559 --> 1090.8799999999999
times and all that but it's analog and

1088.48 --> 1094.0
if there's something there

1090.88 --> 1098.16
even just very short time there is

1094.0 --> 1098.16
going to be like a shadow effect

1099.919 --> 1107.2
hello james 2 yeah i'm doing great

1104.24 --> 1107.2
very hot though

1107.28 --> 1110.3999999999999
a little bit restless

1121.28 --> 1140.48
hello rubbish how come

1137.12 --> 1143.4399999999998
right anyway i'm just giving kind of a

1140.48 --> 1146.32
rough summary of a video that's

1143.44 --> 1146.3200000000002
plenty of footage

1148.0 --> 1152.96
the piece i'm talking about is like half

1149.919 --> 1156.72
an hour 45 minutes

1152.96 --> 1158.08
and i don't know if i'm doing it enough

1156.72 --> 1161.76
credit

1158.08 --> 1161.76
with my short summary of it

1162.48 --> 1166.0
take an error debate well what what do

1164.559 --> 1179.84
you want

1166.0 --> 1179.84
what do you want to know

1182.0 --> 1185.28
there's a lot of things about eric debay

1184.88 --> 1193.8400000000001
both

1185.28 --> 1193.84
positive and negative

1198.64 --> 1201.2
in general

1203.2 --> 1212.4
well in general i think that

1207.6 --> 1215.9189999999999
the guy is a good explainer

1212.4 --> 1216.48
once he gets into like focused is very

1215.919 --> 1219.1200000000001
good

1216.48 --> 1220.159
storytelling it's like somebody that

1219.12 --> 1222.0
would be like

1220.159 --> 1224.159
reading from a book and you'd be

1222.0 --> 1226.08
listening right that's what he does very

1224.159 --> 1229.7600000000002
well

1226.08 --> 1232.559
he's also well he has enough ego

1229.76 --> 1235.44
to really dedicate right so he is

1232.559 --> 1239.28
dedicated to what he does

1235.44 --> 1242.0
on the other hand in his entire lore

1239.28 --> 1243.12
he's frequently over the years and he's

1242.0 --> 1246.4
been at it for a while

1243.12 --> 1250.08
adopted all kinds of strange ideas

1246.4 --> 1253.44
i'm not talking about like political

1250.08 --> 1255.6789999999999
related or anything just cosmogeny

1253.44 --> 1256.88
design ideas he's adopted some weird

1255.679 --> 1260.88
[ __ ]

1256.88 --> 1264.3200000000002
and makes the overall

1260.88 --> 1268.0
uh integrity

1264.32 --> 1269.36
the model the yeah the model has been

1268.0 --> 1272.799
presenting

1269.36 --> 1275.36
kind of iffy like i wouldn't rely on him

1272.799 --> 1276.72
to completely tell you of how the earth

1275.36 --> 1279.4399999999998
really is

1276.72 --> 1281.679
but he has brought just a lot of data to

1279.44 --> 1284.4
the table

1281.679 --> 1285.1200000000001
with his videos he's made a lot of

1284.4 --> 1290.159
effort to

1285.12 --> 1292.559
be international as well

1290.159 --> 1297.1200000000001
unfortunately he's also spawned pretty

1292.559 --> 1297.12
much the savonier complex in flat earth

1300.08 --> 1304.24
and that is like just attack everybody

1303.6 --> 1308.08
else

1304.24 --> 1311.6
and call them chills he pretty much

1308.08 --> 1314.799
started that right he was doing that

1311.6 --> 1315.6789999999999
before flat earth awakening 2050 even it

1314.799 --> 1319.84
really happened

1315.679 --> 1319.8400000000001
he was already doing that

1320.799 --> 1327.76
so yeah eric debay

1324.4 --> 1329.679
very mixed bag he is the root of

1327.76 --> 1331.76
savannier

1329.679 --> 1333.919
not saying that he literally is the

1331.76 --> 1335.52
cause of slovenia complex because it's

1333.919 --> 1338.0
just a condition that a lot of people

1335.52 --> 1341.84
psychological conditions a lot of people

1338.0 --> 1344.96
would get in would risk

1341.84 --> 1347.039
getting in that mindset

1344.96 --> 1348.159
i just thought it was remarkable how

1347.039 --> 1351.2
much he

1348.159 --> 1354.5590000000002
already was pushing those buttons

1351.2 --> 1357.28
very early that was very very

1354.559 --> 1358.559
annoying at the beginning right in the

1357.28 --> 1360.48
beginning we were all

1358.559 --> 1362.0
just trying to like come together and

1360.48 --> 1365.2
really get this like no

1362.0 --> 1368.799
flat earth there's unity and eric debate

1365.2 --> 1371.28
pretty much put a jack saw

1368.799 --> 1371.28
to that

1371.919 --> 1378.0800000000002
and cost a lot of infighting hassle

1375.76 --> 1380.48
right so i'm not gonna forget that part

1378.08 --> 1380.48
either

1384.88 --> 1389.8400000000001
but yes he does have some great content

1398.48 --> 1401.52
i don't believe there's a light particle

1400.48 --> 1404.48
called a photon

1401.52 --> 1404.48
it's just a model

1408.159 --> 1411.5200000000002
the light particle idea is just a model

1410.4 --> 1414.4
even when

1411.52 --> 1418.6399999999999
you get people to explain about it it's

1414.4 --> 1418.64
even considered kind of like a globule

1418.96 --> 1422.32
it already suggests that it is not even

1421.679 --> 1425.3600000000001
actually

1422.32 --> 1429.36
a a unit like an

1425.36 --> 1431.279
like an atom or an electron

1429.36 --> 1433.039
and even an electron unit is kind of

1431.279 --> 1436.159
presupposed as well

1433.039 --> 1436.48
it's it's difficult it's it's basically

1436.159 --> 1439.279
just

1436.48 --> 1439.279
it's only a model

1442.559 --> 1445.6789999999999
i personally think that light is

1444.32 --> 1448.96
infinitely divisible

1445.679 --> 1452.0
beams and that

1448.96 --> 1455.679
the assumption of a particle came from

1452.0 --> 1459.039
the derivation of the minimum

1455.679 --> 1462.0
interaction capability of matter

1459.039 --> 1462.96
photo sensitive material and because

1462.0 --> 1465.6
matter is

1462.96 --> 1467.52
limited in size and then if you size it

1465.6 --> 1470.3999999999999
down even further

1467.52 --> 1473.039
it would theoretically because you can't

1470.4 --> 1476.4
technically just split an atom like that

1473.039 --> 1478.32
manually then it wouldn't be the same

1476.4 --> 1480.72
matter anymore

1478.32 --> 1481.4399999999998
right then the same thing doesn't count

1480.72 --> 1485.52
for light

1481.44 --> 1488.96
so the limited size of the assumed

1485.52 --> 1491.2
particle of light

1488.96 --> 1492.08
is because of the photosensitive

1491.2 --> 1496.4
material

1492.08 --> 1499.52
and the the triggering quanta

1496.4 --> 1502.159
that makes it register so if there was

1499.52 --> 1503.6
theoretically even more sensitive

1502.159 --> 1506.88
material that would have been

1503.6 --> 1509.4399999999998
like 100 of sensitive and

1506.88 --> 1510.0800000000002
spaced out even fine like a much more

1509.44 --> 1513.2
fine

1510.08 --> 1516.0
material then

1513.2 --> 1516.559
who knows the light particle would have

1516.0 --> 1520.0
become

1516.559 --> 1523.36
assumed to be a lesser quanta

1520.0 --> 1524.559
of energy because it was being

1523.36 --> 1526.08
registered as such

1524.559 --> 1529.039
right but they didn't do it they went

1526.08 --> 1530.96
for that specific photo sensitive

1529.039 --> 1535.44
material that was available

1530.96 --> 1539.3600000000001
and by those tests it was concluded

1535.44 --> 1542.96
the light is this size

1539.36 --> 1545.52
basically energy quanta

1542.96 --> 1546.64
but practically it makes no freaking

1545.52 --> 1549.76
sense

1546.64 --> 1552.7990000000002
because how could preponderance of light

1549.76 --> 1555.2
show a micro micronized image

1552.799 --> 1558.32
of things super far in the distance how

1555.2 --> 1560.48
can it all melt apart

1558.32 --> 1562.08
if it was just loose particles it makes

1560.48 --> 1565.559
no sense how

1562.08 --> 1569.36
how could over fast distances particles

1565.559 --> 1572.559
simultaneously travel towards you

1569.36 --> 1576.1589999999999
narrow down and still

1572.559 --> 1578.799
form a logical cohesive micro

1576.159 --> 1580.0800000000002
version of all the light at the

1578.799 --> 1584.08
beginning

1580.08 --> 1587.52
if they are particles makes no freaking

1584.08 --> 1590.799
sense unless light is

1587.52 --> 1590.799
infinitely divisible

1591.279 --> 1595.919
and it is can literally split apart

1593.84 --> 1600.559
indefinitely

1595.919 --> 1600.5590000000002
and then it does make sense to me

1600.96 --> 1608.159
right that is kind of my postulate

1605.039 --> 1608.48
for it that's my idea for light i don't

1608.159 --> 1610.5590000000002
have

1608.48 --> 1613.1200000000001
evidence i'm not a scientist and q is

1610.559 --> 1615.6789999999999
going to be triggered oh yeah

1613.12 --> 1617.4399999999998
i've been putting forward this idea and

1615.679 --> 1620.24
i will

1617.44 --> 1620.88
the rest for of my life if i have to

1620.24 --> 1624.64
until

1620.88 --> 1627.919
i get somebody that literally

1624.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
can convince me that this idea is

1627.919 --> 1641.8400000000001
absolutely irrefutably wrong

1661.84 --> 1666.799
sensitive issues well yes fair target

1665.6 --> 1670.32
containment officer

1666.799 --> 1672.8799999999999
sure right sure he has a proper

1670.32 --> 1677.6
motivation to do what he did

1672.88 --> 1677.6000000000001
but at what cost you know

1677.84 --> 1682.399
now everybody or a lot of people have

1681.52 --> 1685.52
savonia

1682.399 --> 1688.399
issues right what's better

1685.52 --> 1690.0
everybody being paranoid and and

1688.399 --> 1692.399
nitpicky and all about

1690.0 --> 1695.12
ego who has the bigger ego who will

1692.399 --> 1697.52
yield to whose ego

1695.12 --> 1699.6
is that better than that everybody would

1697.52 --> 1701.9189999999999
basically kind of seek back

1699.6 --> 1703.6399999999999
some form of unity and risk getting

1701.919 --> 1706.64
rabbled again because it

1703.64 --> 1710.3200000000002
always happens everywhere

1706.64 --> 1711.1200000000001
in every group forever yeah you can't

1710.32 --> 1715.52
prevent that

1711.12 --> 1715.52
does that mean you must prevent unity

1716.64 --> 1721.8400000000001
is that really a sensible solution look

1718.88 --> 1721.8400000000001
where we're at now

1723.679 --> 1729.919
right there will always be

1727.12 --> 1730.32
gravelers always they will literally

1729.919 --> 1734.3990000000001
come

1730.32 --> 1736.8799999999999
into being where before they were not

1734.399 --> 1738.559
gravelers they were literally just

1736.88 --> 1741.3600000000001
freaking spawn

1738.559 --> 1741.36
in people

1742.32 --> 1746.24
get to them and they will abandon their

1745.279 --> 1748.559
old format

1746.24 --> 1749.52
and choose to become a grabbler it's

1748.559 --> 1752.32
what happens

1749.52 --> 1752.799
it's what people do and when they switch

1752.32 --> 1756.559
it's

1752.799 --> 1760.1589999999999
blatant as [ __ ] you see it happening

1756.559 --> 1762.48
you see it this is not the same person

1760.159 --> 1763.44
that i knew that i can tell all these

1762.48 --> 1766.48
stories about

1763.44 --> 1768.24
can explain exactly how they do things

1766.48 --> 1769.679
how they are motivated what they're for

1768.24 --> 1770.48
long-term philosophy is what their

1769.679 --> 1773.1200000000001
dreams are

1770.48 --> 1775.919
and then suddenly they start playing a

1773.12 --> 1779.6
stupid act

1775.919 --> 1783.0800000000002
get more uncomfortable and then you know

1779.6 --> 1786.52
they are gravelers now that's

1783.08 --> 1789.52
always going to happen

1786.52 --> 1792.8799999999999
forever you can

1789.52 --> 1797.679
never prevent that effect from happening

1792.88 --> 1797.679
ever ever no matter what you do

1799.2 --> 1803.52
yeah ranty is a perfect example for that

1801.36 --> 1806.8799999999999
that's right

1803.52 --> 1809.679
you can never prevent it from happening

1806.88 --> 1812.24
and that's because a whole lot of people

1809.679 --> 1815.679
basically are grabblers

1812.24 --> 1817.36
then they try to escape their gravel

1815.679 --> 1819.2
hood

1817.36 --> 1820.799
try to become kind of like a decent

1819.2 --> 1822.72
human being

1820.799 --> 1824.559
and then during the course of it they

1822.72 --> 1828.0
find out they can't handle it

1824.559 --> 1831.6
and then they abandon

1828.0 --> 1834.48
it and resort back to the old

1831.6 --> 1837.84
grabbler format that's kind of what

1834.48 --> 1837.84
happened with randy

1838.32 --> 1840.559
right

1845.76 --> 1851.84
because it's very uncomfortable to stay

1848.159 --> 1851.8400000000001
in some kind of an act

1852.24 --> 1856.159
even if you're doing it for a good

1853.76 --> 1856.1589999999999
reason

1862.84 --> 1865.84
right

1866.159 --> 1870.72
probably is a made up term for somebody

1868.559 --> 1871.6
someone somebody does not like no it's

1870.72 --> 1875.519
not

1871.6 --> 1879.84
a grappler is a very specific category

1875.519 --> 1882.96
of spirit grabblers are

1879.84 --> 1885.6789999999999
very much obsessed with the earthly

1882.96 --> 1886.559
and they often end up denying the

1885.679 --> 1889.919
spiritual

1886.559 --> 1893.6
except they will use the lingo to

1889.919 --> 1896.64
mind control those that do in order to

1893.6 --> 1896.6399999999999
get more gravel

1897.2 --> 1902.0
right money power mind control

1903.279 --> 1908.64
and gravelers originally came from the

1909.12 --> 1911.84
you know who

1913.679 --> 1917.2
the man with the small hats that that's

1916.08 --> 1921.279
kind of where

1917.2 --> 1924.88
it stemmed from but here's the point

1921.279 --> 1928.159
they are gravelers within their

1924.88 --> 1931.3600000000001
fast and ancient community and religion

1928.159 --> 1934.48
like they are not

1931.36 --> 1937.6
all of them and every freaking group

1934.48 --> 1938.64
has these types of people in them that

1937.6 --> 1943.4399999999998
are grabblers

1938.64 --> 1946.5590000000002
there's grabblers of every race

1943.44 --> 1951.44
every religion

1946.559 --> 1954.559
so yeah it's a human problem

1951.44 --> 1957.76
right it's a human problem not

1954.559 --> 1961.039
a racial problem

1957.76 --> 1964.24
not a religious problem it's a

1961.039 --> 1964.24
human problem

1972.399 --> 1976.0
a gradler denies jesus are you calling

1974.72 --> 1978.3990000000001
me a graveler

1976.0 --> 1990.799
good servant are you literally calling

1978.399 --> 1994.559
me a grabber

1990.799 --> 1996.72
me you just said grabbler denies jesus

1994.559 --> 1999.6789999999999
sacrifice yeah

1996.72 --> 2000.559
i spent yesterday the entire show laying

1999.679 --> 2004.159
down

2000.559 --> 2007.279
how i don't think jesus died so are you

2004.159 --> 2007.279
calling me a graveler

2010.08 --> 2014.6399999999999
because i'm pretty sure that grabblers

2012.159 --> 2016.0800000000002
have an entirely different idea about

2014.64 --> 2019.3600000000001
jesus

2016.08 --> 2022.72
yeah they don't think he didn't die

2019.36 --> 2026.7199999999998
no they think he was a piece of [ __ ]

2022.72 --> 2029.44
that will burn in a lake of [ __ ]

2026.72 --> 2030.84
hell forever that's what a grabbler

2029.44 --> 2033.8400000000001
that's not what i think

2030.84 --> 2036.8799999999999
right g

2033.84 --> 2039.36
grapplers don't even care

2036.88 --> 2039.919
what it was supposed to be about they

2039.36 --> 2043.279
just

2039.919 --> 2046.159
say it's all garbage either he was

2043.279 --> 2049.279
stupid and evil and selfish really

2046.159 --> 2049.279
they'll they'll do that

2049.599 --> 2055.76
and yeah betray your any everything bad

2053.119 --> 2057.04
everything to slander and they'll just

2055.76 --> 2059.2000000000003
condemn him and ignore

2057.04 --> 2060.159
everything he's ever said and done

2059.2 --> 2062.7999999999997
everything

2060.159 --> 2063.28
right that's what a grappler does with

2062.8 --> 2066.8790000000004
it

2063.28 --> 2069.8390000000004
right a grabber is not just

2066.879 --> 2071.44
okay well i have to come out for my

2069.839 --> 2075.359
gravelness

2071.44 --> 2078.079
you know i have to do this

2075.359 --> 2079.52
yeah i don't think christ died i'm a

2078.079 --> 2083.04
grambler now

2079.52 --> 2084.079
no [ __ ] they don't care a grabbler

2083.04 --> 2089.599
doesn't care

2084.079 --> 2093.76
that's what makes him a grabbler

2089.599 --> 2096.8790000000004
right and i've met those these people

2093.76 --> 2098.96
grapplers have serious christ energy and

2096.879 --> 2101.52
that is for his words for the wisdom

2098.96 --> 2105.839
that they don't want to know about

2101.52 --> 2105.839
right that's a graph

2107.28 --> 2111.76
grappler wants your money but if you

2110.56 --> 2115.599
listen to christ

2111.76 --> 2118.8
words follow his example

2115.599 --> 2121.92
then there will be less money

2118.8 --> 2127.92
for the grabbler to grab from

2121.92 --> 2132.7200000000003
you because jesus's wisdom

2127.92 --> 2135.599
helps you against that ah

2132.72 --> 2135.5989999999997
it's very simple

2139.76 --> 2144.5600000000004
right grapplers want to mind control

2142.0 --> 2147.52
people into becoming money producing

2144.56 --> 2147.52
slaves for them

2150.24 --> 2153.4399999999996
that's what a grabber wants

2154.56 --> 2157.7599999999998
and again when i say grappler it's not

2157.44 --> 2161.68
one

2157.76 --> 2164.96
specific racial or religious group

2161.68 --> 2168.3999999999996
it's a very specific type of

2164.96 --> 2171.599
earthly dark spirit

2168.4 --> 2175.44
excluding mindset that comes in

2171.599 --> 2179.119
every in every likeness in every

2175.44 --> 2181.04
site of a person every shape

2179.119 --> 2182.7200000000003
but usually they do end up weirdly

2181.04 --> 2184.48
enough with bigger noses

2182.72 --> 2185.7599999999998
it seems to be kind of like a side

2184.48 --> 2188.64
effect of just

2185.76 --> 2188.6400000000003
yeah it's weird

2191.52 --> 2195.68
but that's not because of their racial

2194.079 --> 2198.8390000000004
background

2195.68 --> 2200.7999999999997
because people of the same racial

2198.839 --> 2204.88
background

2200.8 --> 2206.1600000000003
will not get as huge noses

2204.88 --> 2207.6800000000003
right and that doesn't mean by the way

2206.16 --> 2209.5989999999997
that if you have a big nose in your

2207.68 --> 2211.5989999999997
family that you're automatically like a

2209.599 --> 2214.6400000000003
liar or something but no that's not how

2211.599 --> 2216.8
it works it's very specific it's about

2214.64 --> 2217.7599999999998
how much does it grow it's the pinocchio

2216.8 --> 2220.88
effect it's

2217.76 --> 2220.88
weird how it works

2222.88 --> 2228.56
it's a little weird design thingy right

2226.0 --> 2232.72
has nothing to do

2228.56 --> 2232.72
with how big noses are in your family

2233.44 --> 2239.28
i've met people that had big noses that

2236.64 --> 2243.04
were not liars but you could see it off

2239.28 --> 2246.1600000000003
you could see it it's just you can see

2243.04 --> 2247.7599999999998
someone's spirit when they're a graveler

2246.16 --> 2257.839
and they don't like it when you see it

2247.76 --> 2257.8390000000004
they get skinny

2270.72 --> 2273.04
right

2276.88 --> 2286.8
so hot

2284.079 --> 2288.1600000000003
oh finally a bit of a cloud is coming

2286.8 --> 2291.44
over

2288.16 --> 2293.1189999999997
so i'm gonna take a stand outside take

2291.44 --> 2299.839
some of this wind because i'm really

2293.119 --> 2299.839
overheating here

2313.52 --> 2318.96
all right goody yay i just figured out

2318.0 --> 2321.359
that the wind

2318.96 --> 2323.04
despite feeling cooling because it's

2321.359 --> 2327.2799999999997
going past me is actually

2323.04 --> 2330.56
warmer than the freaking air inside here

2327.28 --> 2330.5600000000004
yeah that didn't really help

2331.44 --> 2337.04
how hot is it here uh last time i looked

2334.4 --> 2340.8
was 29 degrees celsius

2337.04 --> 2344.24
let me check again

2340.8 --> 2355.8390000000004
oh [ __ ] now it's 30 huh

2344.24 --> 2355.839
and it's 50 humidity as well

2358.24 --> 2364.0
do i have a fan yes i do but it makes a

2361.68 --> 2367.359
lot of noise

2364.0 --> 2370.56
i find it very distracting but

2367.359 --> 2375.119
yes i do have one right here

2370.56 --> 2375.119
but yeah this is what it sounds like so

2375.52 --> 2382.64
yeah let's not do that

2379.76 --> 2384.6400000000003
like maybe if it gets like 33 degrees or

2382.64 --> 2385.2799999999997
something i would probably do it just to

2384.64 --> 2388.64
survive

2385.28 --> 2393.6800000000003
if if i'd stream it all in such heat

2388.64 --> 2393.68
but i don't think it's necessary right

2394.839 --> 2397.839
now

2408.839 --> 2411.839
uh

2416.16 --> 2425.839
a ceiling fan i don't have a ceiling fan

2429.359 --> 2439.839
i don't think i would be allowed to try

2431.599 --> 2439.839
and install one of those here

2442.0 --> 2445.68
right but anyway the heat problems here

2444.4 --> 2449.28
are really more

2445.68 --> 2452.8799999999997
in the mornings and early afternoons

2449.28 --> 2456.079
so you know after like three o'clock it

2452.88 --> 2459.359
gets a lot better here even in the dead

2456.079 --> 2460.2400000000002
in the dead heat of summer because it's

2459.359 --> 2462.7999999999997
all about

2460.24 --> 2464.7999999999997
for how long is the sun hitting the wall

2462.8 --> 2466.8
that's what makes it so hot here once

2464.8 --> 2470.88
that stops and it's already stopping

2466.8 --> 2472.88
by the way almost

2470.88 --> 2474.1600000000003
just like a few more minutes i guess at

2472.88 --> 2476.56
two o'clock

2474.16 --> 2477.7599999999998
it will stop hitting it and then it it

2476.56 --> 2480.319
becomes a lot more

2477.76 --> 2480.3190000000004
durable

2490.8 --> 2495.8390000000004
i don't know what you're saying again

2521.119 --> 2524.6400000000003
right so yeah we got at least another

2523.52 --> 2527.92
hour

2524.64 --> 2529.7599999999998
so if you guys want me to talk about

2527.92 --> 2537.839
something

2529.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
a few questions earlier ready for more

2548.839 --> 2551.839
so

2554.64 --> 2557.68
yeah i don't have that

2559.119 --> 2566.2400000000002
look i'm in one little room that's mine

2563.44 --> 2567.839
i'm renting it nothing like that's gonna

2566.24 --> 2570.56
this is not the freaking us

2567.839 --> 2572.24
okay yeah in the us yeah of course you

2570.56 --> 2573.7599999999998
have an air conditioning of this and

2572.24 --> 2574.9599999999996
that and there's nothing isn't that in

2573.76 --> 2578.0
like

2574.96 --> 2579.76
vast quantities of luxurious equipment

2578.0 --> 2581.04
yeah of course it's america yeah well

2579.76 --> 2584.5600000000004
good luck with that

2581.04 --> 2584.56
this is the freaking netherlands

2584.8 --> 2593.8390000000004
i have a room and a computer

2597.599 --> 2602.6400000000003
i'm glad i got that basic cheap ass

2600.319 --> 2606.88
radiator for in the winter

2602.64 --> 2610.48
right that's a luxurious item to me

2606.88 --> 2611.839
that cost me a whole 25 euros lasted me

2610.48 --> 2615.119
like by the way

2611.839 --> 2621.839
over three or four years now crazy

2615.119 --> 2621.839
right cheap ass

2622.96 --> 2629.92
do i live in the city well yeah

2626.96 --> 2629.92
this is utrecht

2632.96 --> 2636.319
it's not the center of the city though

2635.52 --> 2639.44
thank god

2636.319 --> 2640.88
this is more on the outskirts it's a

2639.44 --> 2644.16
really good region

2640.88 --> 2646.8
it's very green as

2644.16 --> 2647.2799999999997
you can all see every single day when i

2646.8 --> 2649.8390000000004
show

2647.28 --> 2649.8390000000004
the outside

2683.76 --> 2691.8390000000004
so anything else

2702.839 --> 2707.839
okay

2705.599 --> 2709.04
oh there's a lot more than that living

2707.839 --> 2711.599
in utrecht

2709.04 --> 2719.839
the trek is a really big city for the

2711.599 --> 2719.839
netherlands that is

2720.16 --> 2733.839
all right there's supposedly 1.3 million

2723.68 --> 2733.839
people living here

2737.359 --> 2743.04
that's a lot of people or is it the

2740.48 --> 2743.04
province

2745.359 --> 2751.68
oh right that's the province i think

2748.4 --> 2758.0
would be a lot between one freaking city

2751.68 --> 2758.0
now it's the city 2020 was

2758.839 --> 2761.839
350

2761.92 --> 2767.6800000000003
000 people right

2765.76 --> 2770.0
so a little over a third of a million

2767.68 --> 2775.839
people for the city

2770.0 --> 2775.839
it's one of our biggest

2783.44 --> 2793.52
although yeah amsterdam specifically 821

2790.24 --> 2793.52
right plenty of people

2798.96 --> 2802.0
what are my thoughts on tattoos pro or

2801.44 --> 2804.56
column well

2802.0 --> 2806.16
i'm against it i don't have any tattoos

2804.56 --> 2817.839
never will

2806.16 --> 2817.839
no marks on me

2818.72 --> 2826.7999999999997
all right i i kept myself

2822.079 --> 2829.04
pure like that from a very early age on

2826.8 --> 2830.2400000000002
so let's thought like yeah you did you

2829.04 --> 2833.7599999999998
oh what you want to

2830.24 --> 2836.4799999999996
use your freaking body as a book well i

2833.76 --> 2837.5200000000004
write things were inspired had drawings

2836.48 --> 2840.319
had ideas

2837.52 --> 2841.839
all the time guess what ten years later

2840.319 --> 2843.7599999999998
i look back and i think

2841.839 --> 2844.88
huh yeah that's interesting i was

2843.76 --> 2847.92
thinking then

2844.88 --> 2849.52
what the hell was i thinking then right

2847.92 --> 2852.16
oh and you're going to put that on your

2849.52 --> 2854.0
body oh this is so cool yeah 10 years

2852.16 --> 2855.7599999999998
later you're like what the [ __ ] was i

2854.0 --> 2858.94
thinking

2855.76 --> 2860.4
or not or even worse right no

2858.94 --> 2863.68
[Music]

2860.4 --> 2867.359
i'm not anti-tattoo

2863.68 --> 2867.359
i just don't want any

2868.64 --> 2875.2
yeah on average i'd say that i prefer

2872.72 --> 2877.7599999999998
my women without as well i don't

2875.2 --> 2887.839
particularly like

2877.76 --> 2887.8390000000004
tattoos like that it's not my thing

2889.52 --> 2901.839
right yeah i got plenty of scars

2926.839 --> 2929.839
wow

2941.44 --> 2946.7200000000003
right so yeah if you're a lady

2944.88 --> 2948.6400000000003
don't worry about it like if you have a

2946.72 --> 2953.68
tattoo whatever but

2948.64 --> 2953.68
i just take it very serious for myself

2953.839 --> 2961.04
and i just thought about it

2957.28 --> 2963.76
a lot more you know

2961.04 --> 2966.64
symbols and ideas and groups and

2963.76 --> 2970.6400000000003
cultures you associate with can make you

2966.64 --> 2973.68
draw tattoo all kinds of things on you

2970.64 --> 2976.16
like and and then then what happens

2973.68 --> 2978.5589999999997
a few years later and like things fall

2976.16 --> 2980.5589999999997
apart or things change dramatically you

2978.559 --> 2982.7200000000003
have a giant change your heart you

2980.559 --> 2984.6400000000003
don't feel associated with that culture

2982.72 --> 2987.839
anymore yeah then what do you freaking

2984.64 --> 2987.839
do wicked tattoos

2988.4 --> 2999.839
you know just i

3001.68 --> 3006.8799999999997
but hey i have seen some really really

3004.72 --> 3010.0789999999997
gorgeous looking tattoos though

3006.88 --> 3012.9
on both women and men

3010.079 --> 3016.099
i just don't want that

3012.9 --> 3016.099
[Music]

3016.96 --> 3022.079
and trust me at occasionally i have had

3020.079 --> 3023.3590000000004
thoughts about like oh i'm gonna make

3022.079 --> 3029.3590000000004
this

3023.359 --> 3032.319
amazing pattern on my body like my own

3029.359 --> 3032.88
i had ideas like when i was really like

3032.319 --> 3035.68
also

3032.88 --> 3037.76
baking symbols and [ __ ] i had some crazy

3035.68 --> 3038.72
ideas of like maybe i could do this on

3037.76 --> 3042.4
there but like

3038.72 --> 3044.7999999999997
make myself into a giant occult symbol

3042.4 --> 3046.8
that only i understand right that i had

3044.8 --> 3048.4
that idea at one point i'm really glad i

3046.8 --> 3055.8390000000004
didn't do it

3048.4 --> 3055.839
this is i really am

3064.319 --> 3068.48
why do you think so many young people

3066.319 --> 3071.68
oriented tattoos who's infusing so much

3068.48 --> 3075.04
more than earlier generations

3071.68 --> 3075.04
well because

3076.319 --> 3083.839
they're not they don't have any

3080.839 --> 3083.839
contextual

3083.92 --> 3091.359
things to reflect those actions upon

3087.76 --> 3093.44
you know i think that

3091.359 --> 3095.7599999999998
in the days where everybody was a lot

3093.44 --> 3098.48
more bible oriented

3095.76 --> 3099.3590000000004
they would peed the warnings from the

3098.48 --> 3101.68
bible so

3099.359 --> 3104.5589999999997
parents would on average always be like

3101.68 --> 3108.3999999999996
no you don't do that that's wrong

3104.559 --> 3109.6800000000003
and maybe teenager does it secretly

3108.4 --> 3113.119
anyway that's

3109.68 --> 3116.24
but now it's like oh no

3113.119 --> 3118.48
everything is okay as long as you don't

3116.24 --> 3122.8799999999997
harm anybody

3118.48 --> 3125.359
don't take heat off the bible

3122.88 --> 3127.599
it's all just nonsense because we're a

3125.359 --> 3131.119
spinning ball

3127.599 --> 3134.8
and and and we evolved from monkeys

3131.119 --> 3138.0
and it's it's just symbolic

3134.8 --> 3140.0
yeah and that's why so many more

3138.0 --> 3142.079
kids just do it because they don't have

3140.0 --> 3144.079
any guidance

3142.079 --> 3145.119
so they're just like yeah why not oh it

3144.079 --> 3148.2400000000002
looks cool oh

3145.119 --> 3150.079
i saw those older people

3148.24 --> 3152.0789999999997
and he thought looked cool then i

3150.079 --> 3155.3590000000004
wouldn't look cool i'm gonna do it

3152.079 --> 3155.3590000000004
yeah that's what happens

3158.16 --> 3162.0
earlier generations didn't really give a

3160.319 --> 3165.44
[ __ ]

3162.0 --> 3169.52
although look tattoos for like

3165.44 --> 3170.2400000000002
ship mates are very old but they had a

3169.52 --> 3174.88
really

3170.24 --> 3178.839
important function a tattoo was really

3174.88 --> 3180.079
very similar to what a a tag is for a

3178.839 --> 3182.88
soldier

3180.079 --> 3184.0
right it was a way to identify them if

3182.88 --> 3188.319
they would go

3184.0 --> 3191.68
yeah go overboard and flush up somewhere

3188.319 --> 3195.52
by their tattoos you could see like yeah

3191.68 --> 3197.1189999999997
this is a shipmate and because of this

3195.52 --> 3199.44
code

3197.119 --> 3200.319
these symbols you kind of know from

3199.44 --> 3202.16
where

3200.319 --> 3204.48
and then you can help inform them so

3202.16 --> 3207.2799999999997
it's like yeah it's just like it

3204.48 --> 3208.0
attack soldiers that's what original

3207.28 --> 3212.6400000000003
tattoos

3208.0 --> 3215.28
were in [ __ ] fairy you understand

3212.64 --> 3215.2799999999997
that's real

3216.24 --> 3226.0
sailors had tattoos for their work

3221.04 --> 3228.079
it was their tag

3226.0 --> 3231.76
for if they flushed overboard and they

3228.079 --> 3231.76
would always be identifiable

3231.839 --> 3238.64
right just yeah

3235.599 --> 3242.319
and in that same respect there's

3238.64 --> 3242.319
slavery tags as well

3242.64 --> 3245.52
that happened too

3246.8 --> 3253.119
both professional and within slavery

3250.4 --> 3253.119
there's tax

3262.16 --> 3266.24
tattooed women are genuinely survivors

3264.88 --> 3269.119
is that true

3266.24 --> 3269.1189999999997
i didn't know that

3271.119 --> 3276.88
i guess that does make sense so but then

3274.319 --> 3280.88
yeah the tattoo would become like a

3276.88 --> 3280.88
symbol of a scar

3290.839 --> 3294.52
sorry

3292.799 --> 3296.559
here's a tattoos verse for

3294.52 --> 3297.359
non-conformist now you need them to

3296.559 --> 3301.119
confirm

3297.359 --> 3304.5589999999997
well [ __ ] that i will not take a tattoo

3301.119 --> 3308.88
ever either under threat of

3304.559 --> 3308.88
death i will never take one

3318.839 --> 3321.839
ever

3336.72 --> 3340.24
right when you're gonna say things like

3339.44 --> 3343.44
that

3340.24 --> 3344.0
then now it's even more set now i will

3343.44 --> 3347.28
never

3344.0 --> 3350.4
ever take one ever again again

3347.28 --> 3353.0400000000004
ever i haven't ever taken any i will

3350.4 --> 3354.799
never take one ever right i was even

3353.04 --> 3356.72
kind of like yeah well maybe at some

3354.799 --> 3358.88
point it will come together well if

3356.72 --> 3360.9599999999996
when you say things like that now that

3358.88 --> 3364.2400000000002
that kind of forces me to decide to

3360.96 --> 3366.7200000000003
never ever take it right

3364.24 --> 3368.0789999999997
because if it's going to get popular

3366.72 --> 3372.16
then i don't want to have

3368.079 --> 3372.1600000000003
anything to do with it ever again

3374.559 --> 3391.8390000000004
it's popular with freaking demons

3408.16 --> 3410.48
all right

3413.28 --> 3418.4
all right and by the way i have a weird

3416.0 --> 3420.559
tendency like that

3418.4 --> 3422.799
i think i actually acted it out to a

3420.559 --> 3425.8390000000004
limited degree in some way at least

3422.799 --> 3427.7599999999998
acted out the principle and that is if

3425.839 --> 3431.839
if people demand

3427.76 --> 3433.3590000000004
like conformity in in senseless and evil

3431.839 --> 3436.799
ways

3433.359 --> 3437.839
i always respond like oh you you want me

3436.799 --> 3441.44
to do this

3437.839 --> 3444.0
to myself or somebody innocent

3441.44 --> 3444.839
okay that means i'm gonna do it to you

3444.0 --> 3448.079
now

3444.839 --> 3451.2
[ __ ] oh oh you thought you could

3448.079 --> 3451.2000000000003
make me do that

3451.359 --> 3456.72
to to get your favor well let me subject

3455.119 --> 3458.88
you to it

3456.72 --> 3461.839
to that thing that you wanted to make me

3458.88 --> 3461.839
do

3468.079 --> 3470.4
right

3473.52 --> 3478.24
i mean yeah oh i must get a tattoo or

of course we all have heard of all the

3819.599 --> 3825.92
new tattoo technology and

3823.119 --> 3828.7200000000003
like weird little magnetic tracer

yesterday

3891.68 --> 3898.0789999999997

3895.119 --> 3898.079
again right away

3900.72 --> 3904.8799999999997
it's good to have a day off from alcohol

you get loose yeah you do but that's

3907.599 --> 3911.28
fine dude

3908.4 --> 3911.28
i appreciate it

3917.359 --> 3922.24
i mean it's kind of a little bit of a

3920.16 --> 3924.16
guilty pleasure because you get kind of

3922.24 --> 3928.319
generous as well and i really

3924.16 --> 3928.319
appreciate that part right

3928.96 --> 3935.039
don't want to like push it though

3933.28 --> 3936.48
what are your thoughts about banning

3935.039 --> 3939.44
cryptocurrency

3936.48 --> 3939.44
that's impossible

3940.72 --> 3943.7599999999998
that makes no sense

3943.92 --> 3948.16
they can contain bitcoin

3948.24 --> 3952.64
bitcoin right must ban bitcoin i've

3950.079 --> 3954.7200000000003
heard of it

3952.64 --> 3955.839
yeah that's that's the bankers making

3954.72 --> 3958.16
their move right

3955.839 --> 3959.839
and yeah they could probably do that

3958.16 --> 3962.3999999999996
with bitcoin

3959.839 --> 3964.24
does that mean that bitcoin trade is

3962.4 --> 3967.76
gonna stop

3964.24 --> 3968.5589999999997
no it just means you won't be able to

3967.76 --> 3971.92
hand it in

3968.559 --> 3974.559
for cash anymore in the netherlands

3971.92 --> 3975.76
yeah that's what it means you can't

3974.559 --> 3979.8390000000004
prevent people from

3975.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
dealing with it you can't

3982.16 --> 3985.92
they're just not being cooperative and

3985.28 --> 3989.92
besides

3985.92 --> 3991.44
it's just bitcoin

3989.92 --> 3993.76
you know how many freaking

3991.44 --> 3996.48
cryptocurrencies are out there right now

3993.76 --> 3997.599
and and growing in number every freaking

3996.48 --> 4000.72
day

3997.599 --> 4004.319
there's no way any system can stop that

4000.72 --> 4004.319
unless they just say okay

4004.64 --> 4010.24
like mandatory forms of currency

4008.0 --> 4012.319
right then you got a problem because

4010.24 --> 4021.839
then it's civilization pretty much

4012.319 --> 4021.839
is over in those regions

4022.48 --> 4025.839
but yes i've heard about the the idea of

4024.88 --> 4027.839
banning

4025.839 --> 4029.599
bitcoin netherlands i've had all kinds

4027.839 --> 4031.44
of issues here in the netherlands and

4029.599 --> 4033.599
even conversation with my dad who's

4031.44 --> 4035.44
a little bit more on top of that than me

4033.599 --> 4036.559
a lot more actually i'm not really on

4035.44 --> 4037.76
top of it at all

4036.559 --> 4040.3190000000004
everything i know pretty much comes

4037.76 --> 4042.559
through my dad and other people i just

4040.319 --> 4046.16
happened to bump into and talk about it

4042.559 --> 4050.48
with but yeah there's already been

4046.16 --> 4050.48
issues with banks

4050.72 --> 4055.359
making it difficult and there are

4052.48 --> 4056.799
certain types of cryptocurrency websites

4055.359 --> 4060.839
that have been completely

4056.799 --> 4063.44
made illegal like you literally

4060.839 --> 4066.16
can use those anymore

4063.44 --> 4067.28
so but it's because of the exchange with

4066.16 --> 4069.0389999999998
money

4067.28 --> 4071.039
right that's where the banks start to

4069.039 --> 4073.8390000000004
block things

4071.039 --> 4075.599
if you have it nobody can stop you from

4073.839 --> 4079.44
trading it

4075.599 --> 4082.079
they could just locally not

4079.44 --> 4082.7200000000003
deal with that they could just say no we

4082.079 --> 4084.799
don't

4082.72 --> 4086.24
we're not gonna take that and give you

4084.799 --> 4091.839
money for it

4086.24 --> 4091.839
right that's it

4124.4 --> 4131.92
maybe frog foot only time will tell

4128.319 --> 4133.279
there's a very very high likelihood

4131.92 --> 4135.759
though

4133.279 --> 4137.52
that at some point in your life in the

4135.759 --> 4139.679
not too distant future

4137.52 --> 4143.4400000000005
to the more distant future if you're

4139.679 --> 4146.0
lucky you're gonna get alzheimer's

4143.44 --> 4147.839
or if that's not the first thing that

4146.0 --> 4149.839
starts to grow symptoms you'll get heart

4147.839 --> 4152.799
problems or lung problems or all kinds

4149.839 --> 4155.2789999999995
of problems with the spike protein

4152.799 --> 4156.239
that is now being produced in your body

4155.279 --> 4175.839000000001
permanently

4156.239 --> 4175.839
right so yeah good luck with that

4185.759 --> 4190.56
wow watched a movie yeah sweetheart

4188.64 --> 4194.0
containment officers

4190.56 --> 4197.6
there there's movies like that

4194.0 --> 4200.84
probably in the

4197.6 --> 4204.320000000001
in the hundreds by now it's

4200.84 --> 4207.52
all [ __ ] all of it

4204.32 --> 4211.759999999999
it's all [ __ ] you're gone okay

4207.52 --> 4211.76
well hey it's your issue you know

4213.84 --> 4219.1990000000005
you took it now it's your problem

4224.56 --> 4228.84
right but this idea of virus release and

4228.239 --> 4231.839999999999
then

4228.84 --> 4234.96
everybody gets

4231.84 --> 4237.1990000000005
sick from infection of the virus this is

4234.96 --> 4239.679
complete horseshit

4237.199 --> 4239.678999999999
all of it

4241.52 --> 4248.080000000001
that will never ever happen

4244.88 --> 4249.36
ever oh you think you have some biblical

4248.08 --> 4253.44
references to it

4249.36 --> 4256.88
and then say that's about no it's not

4253.44 --> 4259.919999999999
that doesn't exist a virus

4256.88 --> 4262.159000000001
miraculously super fast spreading around

4259.92 --> 4265.52
the world and everybody's gonna die

4262.159 --> 4268.799999999999
ball [ __ ] that it can

4265.52 --> 4272.2390000000005
never happen ever not like that

4268.8 --> 4276.0
not through this non-living supposed

4272.239 --> 4276.959999999999
organism spreading and affecting

4276.0 --> 4280.239
everybody

4276.96 --> 4284.4
never that cannot happen it's

4280.239 --> 4286.879999999999
science fiction very old science fiction

4284.4 --> 4288.639999999999
by the way early 20th century science

4286.88 --> 4292.8
fiction is what it is

4288.64 --> 4293.92
it can never happen ever you understand

4292.8 --> 4296.400000000001
doesn't mean that a whole bunch of

4293.92 --> 4298.719
people can't die from something

4296.4 --> 4299.679
but it's never going to be from a virus

4298.719 --> 4302.96
because that

4299.679 --> 4307.0
doesn't exist

4302.96 --> 4311.84
it never did it's a faulty

4307.0 --> 4311.84
presuppositional based model

4313.44 --> 4318.159
it's science fiction earliest 20th

4317.28 --> 4321.199
century

4318.159 --> 4328.879999999999
medical science fiction it does

4321.199 --> 4332.96
not exist

4328.88 --> 4332.96
oh and which pandemic is that

4333.36 --> 4336.32
what pandemic

4339.92 --> 4346.719
metal slug master

4343.6 --> 4351.4400000000005
yeah that's right viruses the model

4346.719 --> 4355.76
an infectious entity that replicates

4351.44 --> 4359.678999999999
as a parasite that doesn't exist

4355.76 --> 4362.96
it's a lie it's early 20th century

4359.679 --> 4367.76
medical science fiction

4362.96 --> 4369.92
it does not exist now that doesn't mean

4367.76 --> 4371.1990000000005
that there is no sickness condition of

4369.92 --> 4374.56
sorts

4371.199 --> 4375.199
it's just not like that it doesn't work

4374.56 --> 4378.400000000001
like that

4375.199 --> 4379.199
at all doesn't work the same as when for

4378.4 --> 4382.4
example

4379.199 --> 4382.879999999999
hostile bacteria enter your body in a

4382.4 --> 4385.5199999999995
wound

4382.88 --> 4387.12
say you're in the jungle you get a wound

4385.52 --> 4388.56
oh yeah you got a problem because now

4387.12 --> 4391.76
you've got an infection an

4388.56 --> 4392.64
actual infection from the outside as a

4391.76 --> 4394.88
parasite

4392.64 --> 4396.0
feeding off you getting more getting

4394.88 --> 4400.32
bigger yet that's an

4396.0 --> 4403.92
infection right viruses are not that

4400.32 --> 4408.08
at all viruses are in your body

4403.92 --> 4408.4800000000005
your entire life they're so persistently

4408.08 --> 4411.44
there

4408.48 --> 4412.08
that any tests to attempt to isolate

4411.44 --> 4414.879999999999
viruses

4412.08 --> 4414.88
in your system

4415.12 --> 4423.44
works with percentages

4420.36 --> 4426.4
percentages of these viral

4423.44 --> 4427.799999999999
things that they claim is this thing

4426.4 --> 4430.879999999999
right exosomes

4427.8 --> 4434.159000000001
percentages of its presence right

4430.88 --> 4437.6
that means it's always

4434.159 --> 4440.32
in you you understand always

4437.6 --> 4441.04
it's always in you because it's body

4440.32 --> 4444.239
inherit

4441.04 --> 4447.36
it's literally a part of your system

4444.239 --> 4449.759999999999
it's a tool of the body

4447.36 --> 4450.639999999999
that's what exosomes are because when

4449.76 --> 4452.719
you get sick

4450.64 --> 4454.56
and the sickness is often associated

4452.719 --> 4456.96
with viruses whatever

4454.56 --> 4458.96
it's because these viral particles these

4456.96 --> 4460.719
exosomes come afloat

4458.96 --> 4462.88
and start to reproduce because they

4460.719 --> 4464.8
claim [ __ ] up and then you get sick

4462.88 --> 4467.04
as a metabolic side effect it's very

4464.8 --> 4468.400000000001
unfortunate but it's actually your body

4467.04 --> 4471.679
restoring yourself

4468.4 --> 4473.839999999999
it's not oh my god there's an infection

4471.679 --> 4476.159
and this thing is replicating and it's

4473.84 --> 4479.4400000000005
eating my cells how do we contain it

4476.159 --> 4483.839999999999
no that's just stupid misunderstanding

4479.44 --> 4483.839999999999
it doesn't work like that at all

4503.52 --> 4507.4400000000005
i didn't try this fire what did that

4508.64 --> 4511.84
doesn't happen

4538.88 --> 4546.2390000000005
okay i don't see why

4542.719 --> 4547.76
no meningitis is a condition

4546.239 --> 4549.44
has nothing to do with the viral

4547.76 --> 4551.6
infection even though it's mentioned

4549.44 --> 4552.48
it even says bacterial infection by the

4551.6 --> 4555.360000000001
way right

4552.48 --> 4556.879999999999
when they say viral infection that means

4555.36 --> 4559.36
that the virus is

4556.88 --> 4561.6
apparently spread up into that location

4559.36 --> 4567.04
to try and do it there locally

4561.6 --> 4570.2390000000005
and yeah that's then literally

4567.04 --> 4574.239
disrupting those cells perhaps right

4570.239 --> 4577.5199999999995
that can cause an infection like effect

4574.239 --> 4579.44
that's not a viral infection invasion

4577.52 --> 4584.400000000001
situation though

4579.44 --> 4584.4
that's again still the metabolism right

4586.719 --> 4591.04
so no there is no meningitis virus that

4589.52 --> 4595.84
doesn't exist

4591.04 --> 4595.84
that's a lie

4598.239 --> 4609.839999999999
just doesn't work

4614.4 --> 4618.799999999999
dr farci is a complete [ __ ]

4619.92 --> 4626.8
like that guy is a literal delusional

4623.76 --> 4628.96
[ __ ] he doesn't know anything

4626.8 --> 4630.8
he's one of the dumbest freaking people

4628.96 --> 4634.84
i've ever seen

4630.8 --> 4637.6
have you ever heard dr fauci say a

4634.84 --> 4640.719
single sensible

4637.6 --> 4642.88
even somewhat smart sounding sentence

4640.719 --> 4644.2390000000005
ever have you ever heard him say

4642.88 --> 4647.52
anything smart

4644.239 --> 4650.32
ever no

4647.52 --> 4651.84
well maybe because it's he's a [ __ ]

4650.32 --> 4654.4
[ __ ]

4651.84 --> 4656.400000000001
and he literally doesn't know what the

4654.4 --> 4659.5199999999995
[ __ ] he's doing he's just

4656.4 --> 4660.08
learn by heart [ __ ] don't think about it

4659.52 --> 4663.76
go with

4660.08 --> 4666.32
it he doesn't even know what the [ __ ]

4663.76 --> 4668.8
he's doing he probably believes viruses

4666.32 --> 4668.799999999999
are real

4669.52 --> 4672.8
even though he doesn't have evidence for

4671.44 --> 4674.48
it not

4672.8 --> 4676.96
actually you know when you would test

4674.48 --> 4679.5199999999995
him on it he'll just stop her stammer

4676.96 --> 4682.0
like a [ __ ] globetard and be like

4679.52 --> 4682.0
come on

4682.88 --> 4689.28
he's a [ __ ] anthony fauci is a

4686.239 --> 4693.678999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ] he

4689.28 --> 4694.32
is a [ __ ] like acne not playing more

4693.679 --> 4698.2390000000005
he's an

4694.32 --> 4702.239
actual [ __ ] he doesn't know

4698.239 --> 4704.718999999999
[ __ ] he read a bunch of things

4702.239 --> 4705.28
like scanning it in like a computer he

4704.719 --> 4708.4
doesn't

4705.28 --> 4711.12
understand [ __ ]

4708.4 --> 4712.96
he just knows how to learn heart by

4711.12 --> 4721.84
heart

4712.96 --> 4721.84
he doesn't understand [ __ ]

4730.719 --> 4734.96
oh all right starting 80 12 that's very

4733.199 --> 4737.12
unfortunate

4734.96 --> 4738.4800000000005
uh well i'm not denying they had

4737.12 --> 4741.679
meningitis

4738.48 --> 4743.599999999999
but from what i looked up and from

4741.679 --> 4746.719
what i understand about the

4743.6 --> 4748.96
misunderstanding of viruses i'd say

4746.719 --> 4749.92
they had the condition yes it's very

4748.96 --> 4753.28
unfortunate

4749.92 --> 4755.36
as no is no proof of any virus being an

4753.28 --> 4758.159
infectious agent from the outside

4755.36 --> 4761.28
causing it though

4758.159 --> 4761.599999999999
overall it would always have to do with

4761.28 --> 4766.4
the

4761.6 --> 4766.400000000001
average condition of the entire person

4768.08 --> 4774.5599999999995
right if it's vulnerable then well

4771.12 --> 4778.0
viruses might be called upon

4774.56 --> 4781.280000000001
from within to try and quickly

4778.0 --> 4782.4
clean up something and that can go wrong

4781.28 --> 4785.5199999999995
too

4782.4 --> 4788.32
especially if there's instabilities

4785.52 --> 4789.1990000000005
and that can happen right it all works

4788.32 --> 4791.36
perfectly if

4789.199 --> 4792.239
everything is stable that's how the body

4791.36 --> 4794.159
works if

4792.239 --> 4795.839999999999
everything is stable then everything

4794.159 --> 4798.879999999999
works perfectly

4795.84 --> 4800.719
perfectly miraculously right but when

4798.88 --> 4804.32
it's not perfectly stable

4800.719 --> 4806.639
then weird [ __ ] happens

4804.32 --> 4809.36
then things go unhinged that's how the

4806.639 --> 4809.36
body works

4816.0 --> 4820.32
that's right and besides now in 80 12

4818.8 --> 4822.4800000000005
it's even said

4820.32 --> 4824.08
when you look it up they put the virus

4822.48 --> 4828.08
in there but they also already say

4824.08 --> 4828.08
it's caused by bacteria right

4828.159 --> 4833.679
so yeah and i've heard of that it's very

4830.84 --> 4836.2390000000005
creepy

4833.679 --> 4838.0
so to attribute it specifically to a

4836.239 --> 4840.879999999999
virus is just like okay

4838.0 --> 4842.48
well your name tagging something and

4840.88 --> 4844.96
then saying

4842.48 --> 4847.04
it's caused by a virus suggesting oh

4844.96 --> 4850.159
there's this little micro particle

4847.04 --> 4853.12
that somehow slipped in and then started

4850.159 --> 4856.638999999999
to reproduce and now you got this thing

4853.12 --> 4860.48
because of that virus or

4856.639 --> 4863.84
you just were in a bad condition

4860.48 --> 4865.839999999999
and viruses started like getting

4863.84 --> 4866.639
triggered like okay there's something

4865.84 --> 4870.32
wrong here

4866.639 --> 4872.4800000000005
we need to clean this up and that gave

4870.32 --> 4873.36
all kinds of side effects that get kind

4872.48 --> 4878.32
of terrible

4873.36 --> 4878.32
leading to the condition of meningitis

4883.28 --> 4886.639
right if there were it was an actual

4885.84 --> 4888.4800000000005
bacterial

4886.639 --> 4891.1990000000005
infection then you would even have to

4888.48 --> 4891.599999999999
get some form of antibiotics or whatever

4891.199 --> 4893.599999999999
to

4891.6 --> 4897.120000000001
to stop the infection because that's an

4893.6 --> 4897.120000000001
actual infection you need to stop

4900.84 --> 4903.84
right

4930.639 --> 4934.32
all right so i hope uh most of you know

4933.52 --> 4938.400000000001
understand

4934.32 --> 4940.08
that yeah the thing that i'm doing with

4938.4 --> 4942.719
the viruses are not real

4940.08 --> 4945.04
it's not me being a conspirator this is

4942.719 --> 4948.4
very serious medical

4945.04 --> 4953.12
literature based and not like i

4948.4 --> 4956.96
am a medical literal literature

4953.12 --> 4957.5199999999995
person i have a stack of documents of

4956.96 --> 4961.6
all the

4957.52 --> 4962.159000000001
new but i do pay very careful attention

4961.6 --> 4965.120000000001
of what's

4962.159 --> 4966.48
out there and how other doctors that are

4965.12 --> 4971.199
like that

4966.48 --> 4974.48
what what they come to conclusion-wise

4971.199 --> 4977.12
and then i remember it i just absorb it

4974.48 --> 4979.36
and i try to puzzle everything together

4977.12 --> 4982.4
and this is the conclusion that it came

4979.36 --> 4987.12
from two also based on

4982.4 --> 4991.12
dr hammer germinal medicine

4987.12 --> 4991.12
and the terrain theory

4991.28 --> 4995.12
which by the way works in conjunction

4993.92 --> 4998.56
with

4995.12 --> 5001.12
with the uh germ theory as well both

4998.56 --> 5003.360000000001
right terrain theory one side germ

5001.12 --> 5006.88
theory the other side

5003.36 --> 5006.88
they're both locked in

5007.12 --> 5015.679
one influences the other the other

5009.04 --> 5018.96
influences the one

5015.679 --> 5022.08
right the terrain is the setting

5018.96 --> 5025.76
the condition the conditions get

5022.08 --> 5030.0
unstable then micro

5025.76 --> 5033.04
elements whether it's bacteria

5030.0 --> 5036.32
anything parasites stability just

5033.04 --> 5038.719
like cellular stability all these things

5036.32 --> 5040.799999999999
depend on the condition overall

5038.719 --> 5042.4800000000005
condition it gets worse much worse

5040.8 --> 5045.1990000000005
or you might not even consciously know

5042.48 --> 5048.4
that but it could get worse

5045.199 --> 5050.0
and then things start to work

5048.4 --> 5054.08
differently because now

5050.0 --> 5055.84
not everything is perfectly in line

5054.08 --> 5057.6
it's kind of misaligned there's things

5055.84 --> 5061.04
wrong and then

5057.6 --> 5063.76
yeah suddenly like a

5061.04 --> 5065.199
micro fungi or some bacteria that's just

5063.76 --> 5067.4400000000005
normally there

5065.199 --> 5069.36
suddenly gets in the way it's like oh

5067.44 --> 5071.36
okay

5069.36 --> 5072.719
uh i'm not contained anymore now i'm

5071.36 --> 5076.239
just gonna grow

5072.719 --> 5079.199
and then you get an infection right

5076.239 --> 5080.48
that's how it really works terrain

5079.199 --> 5083.678999999999
theory

5080.48 --> 5086.718999999999
germ theory lockstep

5083.679 --> 5086.719
with one another

5088.639 --> 5092.639
right but on top of that you just need

5090.96 --> 5097.44
to realize that

5092.639 --> 5100.08
the virus model doesn't exist so

5097.44 --> 5101.5199999999995
early 20th century medical science

5100.08 --> 5104.5599999999995
fiction

5101.52 --> 5106.400000000001
based on germ theory that is proven with

5104.56 --> 5109.6
bacteria

5106.4 --> 5110.5599999999995
but viruses nothing about it works to

5109.6 --> 5113.679
this day

5110.56 --> 5115.84
nothing about it works you can't

5113.679 --> 5118.719
properly isolate anything

5115.84 --> 5121.92
you can't test anything it doesn't it's

5118.719 --> 5125.199
not empirically proven to be infectious

5121.92 --> 5129.36
through physical tests

5125.199 --> 5131.599999999999
it's all faulty marvel

5129.36 --> 5132.4
but guess what yeah it doesn't work

5131.6 --> 5137.6
right

5132.4 --> 5141.28
oh but if you've put it in every movie

5137.6 --> 5143.92
and you make it really scary

5141.28 --> 5145.199
then people don't care they're not going

5143.92 --> 5147.92
to inquire

5145.199 --> 5148.4
how it works they're just going to be oh

5147.92 --> 5152.32
no

5148.4 --> 5153.04
i'm scared now of the virus oh i go to

5152.32 --> 5156.32
doctor

5153.04 --> 5157.36
with shot like in the movie because when

5156.32 --> 5161.36
doctor gave you

5157.36 --> 5166.5599999999995
shot for a virus you go better

5161.36 --> 5166.5599999999995
oh oh yeah and that's where we're at now

5167.04 --> 5170.8
you all know how that works

5178.08 --> 5184.8
it's mind control programming virus

5181.12 --> 5186.239
viruses as an original science fiction

5184.8 --> 5189.4400000000005
concept

5186.239 --> 5193.12
stemming from early futurism has

5189.44 --> 5196.638999999999
grown into a pure pure

5193.12 --> 5200.159
social engineering based mind control

5196.639 --> 5203.04
device that's literally

5200.159 --> 5204.4
what we're where we're at right now

5203.04 --> 5207.84
they've literally just

5204.4 --> 5211.04
opened that door for

5207.84 --> 5213.4400000000005
a little over a year that's what this is

5211.04 --> 5215.679
that's what's happening right now

5213.44 --> 5216.96
they let it breed they did the

5215.679 --> 5220.32
programming now they

5216.96 --> 5223.44
open the door and behold

5220.32 --> 5224.08
the effects roll out exactly as

5223.44 --> 5226.48
predicted

5224.08 --> 5228.08
people don't want to know they'll take

5226.48 --> 5229.919999999999
the freaking shot and die

5228.08 --> 5231.76
they'll take it and get mutilated i have

5229.92 --> 5235.04
to get it again

5231.76 --> 5238.159000000001
yeah yeah yeah exactly like predicted

5235.04 --> 5242.08
because it's a social engineering mind

5238.159 --> 5245.839999999999
control device stemming from earlier

5242.08 --> 5249.0
20th century medical science fiction

5245.84 --> 5251.92
it's been programmed deeply into

5249.0 --> 5255.04
everyone everyone that's

5251.92 --> 5256.639
alive right now has been subjected to

5255.04 --> 5259.84
this programming

5256.639 --> 5261.1990000000005
unless you're like what is it over 120

5259.84 --> 5264.32
years old

5261.199 --> 5266.879999999999
right well there's not many people left

5264.32 --> 5268.96
that age right so yeah everybody has

5266.88 --> 5272.2390000000005
been subjected

5268.96 --> 5275.28
to the mind control device we know

5272.239 --> 5277.759999999999
as viral virus infection

5275.28 --> 5279.5199999999995
everyone that's still alive has been

5277.76 --> 5280.08
programmed with this one way or another

5279.52 --> 5284.080000000001
has grown

5280.08 --> 5295.84
up in the assumption that that's real

5284.08 --> 5295.84
everyone it's a big obstacle

5305.02 --> 5308.089000000001
[Music]

5318.08 --> 5322.08
which scientist either current or

5320.639 --> 5324.56
historical was the most

5322.08 --> 5324.5599999999995
valid

5328.719 --> 5331.84
i i can't say

5332.8 --> 5338.4800000000005
you know it's kind of universal that

5336.0 --> 5340.32
the biggest grabblers get the biggest

5338.48 --> 5341.5199999999995
front row seat in the historical

5340.32 --> 5344.5599999999995
narrative

5341.52 --> 5346.719
right so the worse you are the more

5344.56 --> 5349.280000000001
you've been put into front line

5346.719 --> 5352.96
programming for society

5349.28 --> 5354.4
so it's very tough to actually determine

5352.96 --> 5356.719
who

5354.4 --> 5358.0
were the real scientists because i bet

5356.719 --> 5362.0
there's been

5358.0 --> 5364.08
hundreds of really amazing scientists

5362.0 --> 5365.679
in at least the last hundred years and

5364.08 --> 5369.76
probably for that well

5365.679 --> 5371.76
as well that have just been completely

5369.76 --> 5374.8
ignored that knew

5371.76 --> 5376.400000000001
very quickly like this is [ __ ] this

5374.8 --> 5378.320000000001
world is [ __ ]

5376.4 --> 5379.759999999999
these controllers are [ __ ] they're

5378.32 --> 5381.92
only interested in

5379.76 --> 5383.76
[ __ ] mind control and abusing

5381.92 --> 5386.2390000000005
everybody

5383.76 --> 5388.96
and they would have had genius ideas and

5386.239 --> 5388.959999999999
just never

5389.199 --> 5393.599999999999
were able to basically do anything with

5391.679 --> 5394.0
it right there might have even been like

5393.6 --> 5396.639
these

5394.0 --> 5397.84
scientists that just isolated themselves

5396.639 --> 5399.92
figured things out

5397.84 --> 5401.04
made a book perhaps for themselves and

5399.92 --> 5405.1990000000005
then when they died

5401.04 --> 5407.6
the grapplers would come in confiscated

5405.199 --> 5409.28
and then freaking keep it a secret for

5407.6 --> 5412.639
themselves

5409.28 --> 5416.32
right so you don't know you don't

5412.639 --> 5419.92
know they don't allow you to really know

5416.32 --> 5420.4
who are the real scientists only show

5419.92 --> 5424.08
you

5420.4 --> 5428.159
the grabblers on the front row

5424.08 --> 5432.0
nikola tesla well nikola tesla

5428.159 --> 5433.599999999999
was quite brilliant but he was not

5432.0 --> 5438.32
perfect

5433.6 --> 5440.96
he fell for some of his own machinations

5438.32 --> 5441.84
and now that's not the right word uh not

5440.96 --> 5445.28
machination

5441.84 --> 5449.4400000000005
uh he found aberrations

5445.28 --> 5452.719
and he couldn't get out of him

5449.44 --> 5454.799999999999
right he's not perfect but he was

5452.719 --> 5455.92
brilliant in the sense that he had an

5454.8 --> 5458.8
amazing

5455.92 --> 5464.88
fractal insight on just the nature of

5458.8 --> 5469.4400000000005
reality itself but he was absolutely not

5464.88 --> 5477.84
unblemished he was not perfect

5469.44 --> 5477.839999999999
he was great though in many ways

5479.92 --> 5486.4
did tesla believe that he i don't know

5483.12 --> 5486.4
there's no reference of it

5487.76 --> 5491.52
i don't think he he even let his mind go

5490.56 --> 5494.719
dwell there

5491.52 --> 5497.040000000001
he was just so focused on trying to get

5494.719 --> 5498.639
the model for electrics and magnetics

5497.04 --> 5501.84
together and all that

5498.639 --> 5503.679
he just didn't give a [ __ ]

5501.84 --> 5505.1990000000005
it's like yeah [ __ ] you in your

5503.679 --> 5508.2390000000005
exploration i'm gonna

5505.199 --> 5511.839999999999
i'm gonna get this right right

5508.239 --> 5514.0
he was probably very much

5511.84 --> 5515.12
just obsessed with his work and didn't

5514.0 --> 5519.84
give a [ __ ]

5515.12 --> 5519.84
about the rest of the world really

5544.84 --> 5549.1990000000005
ugh

5546.88 --> 5551.04
right sphere ton containment officer

5549.199 --> 5553.678999999999
well just goes to show

5551.04 --> 5554.32
it's a condition and this condition can

5553.679 --> 5556.96
arrive

5554.32 --> 5557.84
through all kinds of things except the

5556.96 --> 5561.28
virus

5557.84 --> 5565.6
that's [ __ ] although literally

5561.28 --> 5565.599999999999
calling it filo might actually be

5568.32 --> 5571.44
god i hope people are gonna get this

5570.56 --> 5574.2390000000005
it's very

5571.44 --> 5575.5199999999995
very tiresome even realizing it it could

5574.239 --> 5578.08
be that when they say

5575.52 --> 5578.080000000001
viral

5579.12 --> 5586.08
it's actually a a kind of a

5583.04 --> 5590.32
as a red herring

5586.08 --> 5592.5599999999995
it's like calling it atmosphere

5590.32 --> 5592.5599999999995
right

5593.36 --> 5597.12
with the air in the realm calling it the

5596.159 --> 5600.48
atmosphere

5597.12 --> 5603.84
like that so they might simply

5600.48 --> 5607.12
call it viral when it just means

5603.84 --> 5608.2390000000005
oh viruses are doing their thing in the

5607.12 --> 5610.719
body the

5608.239 --> 5612.879999999999
metabolism are doing their thing it can

5610.719 --> 5614.32
lead to it as well and then they just

5612.88 --> 5617.04
call it viral

5614.32 --> 5617.84
because it's basically viral in that

5617.04 --> 5621.84
sense would

5617.84 --> 5624.56
another word would be exosome

5621.84 --> 5624.56
related

5625.199 --> 5629.12
right i think that would be a better

5627.92 --> 5631.28
description for it

5629.12 --> 5633.44
it's like oh yeah exosomes are involved

5631.28 --> 5635.04
that process of when they do their thing

5633.44 --> 5637.839999999999
in your body

5635.04 --> 5639.199
that is involved in the condition that

5637.84 --> 5642.0
would be a weather better way to

5639.199 --> 5646.239
describe it in my opinion

5642.0 --> 5646.239
they just call it viral everywhere

5648.8 --> 5653.679
is there any proof tesla no there isn't

5651.679 --> 5654.159
but as i said i don't think he gave a

5653.679 --> 5657.36
[ __ ]

5654.159 --> 5660.239
like at all he probably

5657.36 --> 5661.36
like looked down not just a little but a

5660.239 --> 5664.959999999999
lot

5661.36 --> 5665.92
on all the astrologers or astronomers

5664.96 --> 5667.6
and all that like he

5665.92 --> 5669.28
thought they were probably completely

5667.6 --> 5672.0
[ __ ] because they were

5669.28 --> 5672.719
and they still are they were [ __ ]

5672.0 --> 5675.12
back then

5672.719 --> 5677.76
those people were just as [ __ ] and

5675.12 --> 5679.36
deluded back then as they are now

5677.76 --> 5681.4400000000005
although now it's more because you're

5679.36 --> 5684.88
just more it's more compacted

5681.44 --> 5686.96
through the social media and all that

5684.88 --> 5689.04
right but they were just as [ __ ]

5686.96 --> 5691.76
back then as they are now

5689.04 --> 5693.199
and tesla having fractal inside very

5691.76 --> 5695.119000000001
likely that he did

5693.199 --> 5696.719
you just saw that and just like you're

5695.119 --> 5699.599999999999
all [ __ ] idiots i

5696.719 --> 5702.159
i don't even want to have a memory of

5699.6 --> 5704.400000000001
your existence

5702.159 --> 5706.5599999999995
i could imagine he was like that right

5704.4 --> 5708.96
just say like now [ __ ] all of you

5706.56 --> 5711.04
you're all idiots you're all satanic

5708.96 --> 5712.96
delusional freaks

5711.04 --> 5715.92
i want nothing to do with you i'm gonna

5712.96 --> 5719.36
work out this electric magnetic thing

5715.92 --> 5720.4
and you can all go to hell i think that

5719.36 --> 5723.679
that was

5720.4 --> 5729.36
probably a big big part of what drove

5723.679 --> 5732.88
tesla nikola tesla

5729.36 --> 5732.88
if he ever really existed

5733.28 --> 5743.84
it's hard to tell man

5755.52 --> 5760.0
what's my opinion on isaac newton ooh

5760.95 --> 5765.36
[Applause]

5762.88 --> 5767.679
i said newton is a really interesting

5765.36 --> 5771.199
character

5767.679 --> 5775.6
i think it's hard to be

5771.199 --> 5775.599999999999
sure but i think that he's actually been

5776.32 --> 5783.679
blemished a lot right

5779.92 --> 5785.6
he literally never he never he didn't

5783.679 --> 5789.28
what he disassociated

5785.6 --> 5792.320000000001
himself with the notion

5789.28 --> 5793.04
that there is a viable hypothesis to

5792.32 --> 5795.679
gravity

5793.04 --> 5797.679
to gravitation he literally wrote a

5795.679 --> 5800.32
passionate letter about that

5797.679 --> 5802.32
to somebody declaring like absolutely

5800.32 --> 5803.679
not and guess what it became newtonian

5802.32 --> 5806.5599999999995
gravity

5803.679 --> 5808.08
that gives me the idea that he was

5806.56 --> 5809.92
actually kind of

5808.08 --> 5811.5199999999995
a person with integrity a lot of

5809.92 --> 5816.32
integrity and

5811.52 --> 5819.679
a sense for god right

5816.32 --> 5820.48
it wasn't it was pretty serious when it

5819.679 --> 5823.04
came to that

5820.48 --> 5824.799999999999
and studied and in all directions too

5823.04 --> 5828.32
you know a bit of a wizard

5824.8 --> 5830.96
kind a bit of a just wanted to was very

5828.32 --> 5834.239
curious in nature probably

5830.96 --> 5838.719
but he was a good person i think

5834.239 --> 5841.04
and i think that he never meant it to be

5838.719 --> 5842.88
like this he never meant it to be like a

5841.04 --> 5844.08
scientific standard i always thought

5842.88 --> 5847.52
that

5844.08 --> 5850.719
his newtonian mechanics

5847.52 --> 5851.76
it was just his project of figuring out

5850.719 --> 5855.44
the mechanics

5851.76 --> 5857.84
and he never claimed

5855.44 --> 5859.36
that it was actually completely the

5857.84 --> 5863.76
reality

5859.36 --> 5866.4
it was just yeah a tool

5863.76 --> 5868.56
like newton's laws are just the law

5866.4 --> 5870.799999999999
within his model

5868.56 --> 5872.159000000001
which has issues and he knew that so

5870.8 --> 5875.119000000001
he's yeah

5872.159 --> 5875.119
it's very tough

5875.28 --> 5880.719
but i i do think that newton did have

5877.679 --> 5883.84
scientific integrity he knew about

5880.719 --> 5883.84
just like

5884.0 --> 5889.04
he knew that his model was not complete

5892.48 --> 5897.599999999999
right so i think he's being poo-pooed a

5895.92 --> 5900.2390000000005
lot because a whole bunch of people

5897.6 --> 5902.56
are still referencing to his new tony

5900.239 --> 5904.799999999999
mechanics and supposedly being real in

5902.56 --> 5906.719
the cosmos and it's still grafted into

5904.8 --> 5910.4800000000005
the globe model and all that

5906.719 --> 5914.32
even though it's officially not even

5910.48 --> 5914.32
there anymore still use it

5917.76 --> 5925.84
but i think the individual wasn't

5921.04 --> 5925.84
half as bad as most people think he was

5932.32 --> 5939.84
newton's invention of mathematical

5935.44 --> 5939.839999999999
calculus what

5941.04 --> 5953.84
what is that doesn't ring a bell

5968.56 --> 5983.52
oh he invented calculus it says

5980.48 --> 5986.959999999999
oh interesting okay so he did some

5983.52 --> 5986.96
mathematical study as well

5988.32 --> 5991.599999999999
huh all right

5992.719 --> 5996.56
i'm personally not particularly

5994.719 --> 5998.4800000000005
interested in those types of things but

5996.56 --> 6001.679
i guess

5998.48 --> 6005.28
he did that i i'm not a mathematician so

6001.679 --> 6005.28
i can't really size up how

6005.52 --> 6010.639
yeah how valuable that has turned out to

6020.84 --> 6023.84
be

6034.84 --> 6037.84
so

6037.92 --> 6041.76
life is too short to figure out a

6039.52 --> 6044.96
perfect model but there is no perfect

6041.76 --> 6046.8
model for reality there's always more

6044.96 --> 6049.199
but i don't think life's too short at

6046.8 --> 6049.679
all to do that it's just that most

6049.199 --> 6054.0
people

6049.679 --> 6056.4
end up not wanting to do it anymore

6054.0 --> 6056.4
because

6057.6 --> 6060.639
personal reasons

6063.44 --> 6068.239
there's there's really no gratification

6066.32 --> 6071.36
in perfection did anybody

6068.239 --> 6073.28
ever realize that you know the striving

6071.36 --> 6076.719
for perfection

6073.28 --> 6078.719
can be a worthwhile goal

6076.719 --> 6080.2390000000005
especially to develop yourself and to

6078.719 --> 6084.639
keep learning

6080.239 --> 6088.0
but in theory reaching perfection

6084.639 --> 6088.88
is terrible because when you reach

6088.0 --> 6090.719
perfection

6088.88 --> 6092.2390000000005
theoretically there's no more

6090.719 --> 6093.679
improvement there's nothing more you

6092.239 --> 6097.599999999999
could do

6093.679 --> 6100.88
it's basically the death of spirit

6097.6 --> 6102.96
so that's all in theory by the way

6100.88 --> 6107.52
because i don't think anybody can even

6102.96 --> 6110.639
ever reach perfection

6107.52 --> 6114.8
real perfection is

6110.639 --> 6114.8
the perfect balance between

6118.84 --> 6124.8
imperfections

6121.6 --> 6128.08
it's a perfect balance that that makes

6124.8 --> 6128.08
practical perfection

6133.04 --> 6137.28
that's what halocentrism is the idea

6134.96 --> 6140.2390000000005
that they have a perfect model

6137.28 --> 6140.48
yeah the idea unfortunately in reality

6140.239 --> 6142.879999999999
is

6140.48 --> 6143.599999999999
exactly the opposite it's the most

6142.88 --> 6146.639
broken

6143.6 --> 6149.84
imperfect illogical model humanity has

6146.639 --> 6149.84
ever managed to conceive

6156.08 --> 6161.6
what were my strongest subjects in

6157.76 --> 6164.08
school well not language no

6161.6 --> 6165.1990000000005
i was really good at english pretty

6164.08 --> 6168.719
early on

6165.199 --> 6172.32
though uh

6168.719 --> 6172.32
my strongest subjects

6174.639 --> 6180.22
i guess it's tough

6178.4 --> 6183.329
i put a lot of effort in art

6180.22 --> 6183.329000000001
[Music]

6183.52 --> 6191.1990000000005
i was pretty good at physics and

6187.52 --> 6193.52
yeah math i was just really good at it

6191.199 --> 6194.638999999999
on an intuitive level like really good

6193.52 --> 6196.56
at it

6194.639 --> 6198.719
i like massive the spectrum of the

6196.56 --> 6201.119000000001
material that was available i could just

6198.719 --> 6203.36
see through it

6201.119 --> 6205.04
so i often didn't even understand the

6203.36 --> 6207.759999999999
question i would just

6205.04 --> 6208.32
be very good at guessing what the answer

6207.76 --> 6211.280000000001
would be

6208.32 --> 6214.639
based on the pattern not literally not

6211.28 --> 6214.639
even understanding what it is

6215.76 --> 6218.96
i wouldn't know actually how to

6217.76 --> 6220.88
calculate

6218.96 --> 6222.0
yeah that's how i got through a lot of

6220.88 --> 6224.56
math it's weird

6222.0 --> 6224.56
but it worked

6226.0 --> 6230.08
even helped a whole bunch of people out

6228.0 --> 6234.0
that were blocked in their learning

6230.08 --> 6237.119
through that it's weird

6234.0 --> 6240.239
so yeah but i basically had dutch

6237.119 --> 6244.0
english math

6240.239 --> 6247.839999999999
physics biology and art

6244.0 --> 6247.84
and it was pretty good in all of it

6249.28 --> 6252.639
but no i've never been a linguist i i'm

6251.84 --> 6255.6
only

6252.639 --> 6257.119
really any good when it comes to foreign

6255.6 --> 6260.159000000001
languages

6257.119 --> 6262.08
i'm only really good at english i

6260.159 --> 6275.839999999999
can't really speak any other language

6262.08 --> 6275.84
besides my my native language

6282.32 --> 6289.84
well the model is perfect in the sense

6284.639 --> 6289.84
that it is perfectly delusional

6291.36 --> 6293.599999999999
right

6296.08 --> 6301.6
it's just as delusional as somebody in a

6299.04 --> 6302.639
maniacal mood saying i have attained

6301.6 --> 6305.360000000001
godhood

6302.639 --> 6306.56
oh i've attained god well everybody is

6305.36 --> 6309.679
that looking at that

6306.56 --> 6312.2390000000005
it's blatantly obvious no you're just

6309.679 --> 6316.159
out of your mind

6312.239 --> 6316.159
right you're just manic

6316.639 --> 6319.84
right well yeah if you believe oh the

6319.119 --> 6323.44
ball

6319.84 --> 6327.119000000001
is the solution yeah that's because

6323.44 --> 6331.04
you're in an arrogant delusion

6327.119 --> 6333.599999999999
that you got it like you got it all

6331.04 --> 6335.36
now you know everything it's completely

6333.6 --> 6337.360000000001
[ __ ] and delusional

6335.36 --> 6340.48
right and that's really what it is it's

6337.36 --> 6342.5599999999995
more about the idea

6340.48 --> 6344.08
because when you dig into the physical

6342.56 --> 6346.639
material the actual

6344.08 --> 6348.239
reading work and physics and how things

6346.639 --> 6350.08
are working and the models and the

6348.239 --> 6350.799999999999
language then you figure out it's all

6350.08 --> 6355.28
[ __ ]

6350.8 --> 6357.92
it's all lies machinations

6355.28 --> 6358.88
and distraction tactics to make you to

6357.92 --> 6362.159
prevent you from

6358.88 --> 6367.4400000000005
realizing how wrong it is

6362.159 --> 6367.44
in so many ways right

6367.52 --> 6371.360000000001
so the globe model it it doesn't thrive

6370.639 --> 6374.88
on the model

6371.36 --> 6375.92
it thrives on the idea that you got it

6374.88 --> 6378.2390000000005
all

6375.92 --> 6379.04
it turns everything inside out and makes

6378.239 --> 6382.159
you believe

6379.04 --> 6385.119
that by believing it you have attained

6382.159 --> 6387.199
ultimate knowledge but that's a

6385.119 --> 6390.719
sensation

6387.199 --> 6393.04
the sensation of thinking delusionally

6390.719 --> 6395.119
because it is delusion you've attained

6393.04 --> 6398.84
ultimate knowledge

6395.119 --> 6400.48
it's a sense a sensation it's not

6398.84 --> 6402.56
actually

6400.48 --> 6403.678999999999
it's kind of more like this sense of a

6402.56 --> 6406.080000000001
promise

6403.679 --> 6408.159
like oh you trust that you've attained

6406.08 --> 6409.5199999999995
this ultimate knowledge

6408.159 --> 6411.44
but hey if you're going to test it

6409.52 --> 6411.84
you're going to bump into [ __ ] every

6411.44 --> 6414.799999999999
time

6411.84 --> 6415.92
right but if you really like the

6414.8 --> 6418.4800000000005
sensation

6415.92 --> 6420.719
of thinking that you've that you have

6418.48 --> 6422.638999999999
ultimate knowledge within your reach

6420.719 --> 6423.76
then you might just keep on believing

6422.639 --> 6429.84
that and not

6423.76 --> 6429.84
test whether it is real or not

6432.4 --> 6435.839999999999
which language do i think you got your

6434.639 --> 6439.92
english

6435.84 --> 6441.92
both i think english

6439.92 --> 6443.1990000000005
also think dutch it's a different

6441.92 --> 6446.2390000000005
frequency

6443.199 --> 6447.839999999999
when i talk dutch with dutch people i

6446.239 --> 6450.48
think in dutch

6447.84 --> 6452.2390000000005
by the way which makes it extremely

6450.48 --> 6454.5599999999995
confusing

6452.239 --> 6457.04
when dutch people start to graft in

6454.56 --> 6458.320000000001
english words in their vocabulary in the

6457.04 --> 6460.32
middle of a sentence

6458.32 --> 6463.84
because they don't know the dutch word

6460.32 --> 6465.92
for it too much english media huh

6463.84 --> 6466.96
too little conversation with your

6465.92 --> 6470.08
parents

6466.96 --> 6472.32
in dutch so you learn your language from

6470.08 --> 6474.639
the media in english and then you end up

6472.32 --> 6475.599999999999
grafting freaking english words into

6474.639 --> 6478.400000000001
your

6475.6 --> 6480.159000000001
common speech now that is really

6478.4 --> 6481.199
confusing to me because then they kind

6480.159 --> 6483.36
of in a second

6481.199 --> 6484.638999999999
forced me to subtly switch the voice in

6483.36 --> 6488.48
my head

6484.639 --> 6491.679
that's very confusing to me but yes i

6488.48 --> 6492.48
literally think in english when i do

6491.679 --> 6496.0
this show

6492.48 --> 6498.239
completely and i can switch to dutch

6496.0 --> 6501.28
and then suddenly i think dutch it's

6498.239 --> 6501.28
just two different

6501.6 --> 6504.96
codes two different frequencies coming

6504.0 --> 6508.8
in and i

6504.96 --> 6510.0
i am both i am both english and i'm both

6508.8 --> 6513.84
dutch

6510.0 --> 6513.84
in my thinking

6516.639 --> 6521.4400000000005
right anyway i'm gonna round out the

6518.0 --> 6521.44
show well time has flown

6521.52 --> 6526.2390000000005
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6524.159 --> 6528.638999999999
like this show

6526.239 --> 6530.879999999999
if you did then please don't forget to

6528.639 --> 6532.4800000000005
rogan's it up and if you haven't already

6540.32 --> 6543.599999999999
and please also do support me through

6542.4 --> 6545.92
the paypal

6543.6 --> 6547.6
patreon crypto wallet super chat and the

6545.92 --> 6550.0
membership system join button

6547.6 --> 6550.8
that will be much appreciated i could

6550.0 --> 6553.04
really still

6550.8 --> 6554.56
use the paypal support please keep them

6553.04 --> 6556.8
coming

6554.56 --> 6557.84
i still need to get through the next

6556.8 --> 6561.4400000000005
week

6557.84 --> 6564.08
half a week serious so i could still use

6561.44 --> 6566.638999999999
even just some minor support

6564.08 --> 6568.639
10 bucks or something would be great if

6566.639 --> 6572.08
you could spare it

6568.639 --> 6574.32
uh and thanks of course those that have

6572.08 --> 6577.199
supported me in the last few days

6574.32 --> 6579.199
every little bit helps right i will be

6577.199 --> 6580.96
back tomorrow with flat earth early bird

6579.199 --> 6583.28
number 928

6580.96 --> 6585.04
on the friday and i'm gonna join the

6583.28 --> 6587.36
flat earth debates which have

6585.04 --> 6590.08
just already gotten gone live so i'm
