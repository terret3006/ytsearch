117.36 --> 123.03999999999999
gray soup

118.719 --> 123.03999999999999
not as misty as it was yesterday though

123.52 --> 128.239
see now you can see the building in the

125.28 --> 129.75900000000001
distance

128.239 --> 132.72
but other than that it's pretty much the

129.759 --> 134.55999999999997
same it's kind of moist and

132.72 --> 137.76
i think it's water cold

134.56 --> 137.76
i'll check the temperature

139.76 --> 145.76
yeah another particularly interesting

142.64 --> 145.76
looking outdoor day

all right

168.879 --> 176.51899999999998

171.68 --> 176.519
the 14th of january 2022.

177.599 --> 180.07999999999998
and

180.56 --> 187.04
yeah it's been a lot of interesting

182.959 --> 187.04
stuff i saw on youtube

189.44 --> 192.0
ah

190.319 --> 193.28
hello peace dune

192.0 --> 194.8
first in chat

193.28 --> 199.8
you thought it was interesting about the

194.8 --> 199.8
assain asylums yes i agree

203.76 --> 207.35999999999999
i

204.48 --> 210.72
in retrospect i should probably

207.36 --> 212.4
rename yesterday's video

210.72 --> 216.56
i just kind of

212.4 --> 216.56
haphazardly call the drums in the deep

218.959 --> 223.2
because it was kind of referring to just

221.04 --> 223.2
the

224.159 --> 227.92
kind of like that feeling

226.48 --> 230.959
it was just yeah

227.92 --> 235.04
description of feelings but

230.959 --> 238.72
what should i even call yesterday's show

235.04 --> 239.67999999999998
i don't know i'm open for suggestions

238.72 --> 242.68
hello

239.68 --> 242.68
kevlar

259.759 --> 263.52000000000004
okay

261.759 --> 265.68
well that's

263.52 --> 267.84
is that some kind of personal commentary

265.68 --> 270.16
there peace dude did you know they can

267.84 --> 271.84
teach a person they should be tortured

270.16 --> 273.52000000000004
all their life and

271.84 --> 275.84
run away

273.52 --> 277.75899999999996
from any social interaction with society

275.84 --> 280.75899999999996
by teaching them to daydream all their

277.759 --> 280.759
life

282.0 --> 285.52
because i don't know how that relates to

283.759 --> 290.08000000000004
the

285.52 --> 290.08
asylum observation i had yesterday

293.12 --> 296.479
right anyway

294.72 --> 300.68
yeah yesterday's show

296.479 --> 300.68
was overall very interesting

308.09 --> 311.21999999999997
[Music]

315.29 --> 318.559
[Applause]

322.1 --> 327.04
[Applause]

346.56 --> 349.759
[Applause]

366.88 --> 369.68
ah

367.68 --> 370.88
right

369.68 --> 373.44
spelling

370.88 --> 375.36
it's difficult sometimes

373.44 --> 376.479
right so yeah i'm calling yesterday's

375.36 --> 378.72
show

376.479 --> 382.15999999999997
were 18th century insane asylums

378.72 --> 382.16
actually political prisons

386.639 --> 391.72
yeah but it's mostly what i know

398.0 --> 404.12
all right

399.68 --> 404.12
okay peace dune fine

412.639 --> 415.36
right uh

419.84 --> 426.56
yeah i was just watching a really

422.16 --> 426.56
interesting video from howdy majowski

429.759 --> 435.8
although i can't seem to find it now

432.319 --> 435.8
what is that

439.52 --> 442.639
i was just there

445.68 --> 448.68
huh

450.0 --> 453.52
anyway it was about the chicago world

452.24 --> 455.759
fair

453.52 --> 457.52
some really detailed observations very

455.759 --> 460.639
interesting

457.52 --> 460.639
and mysterious

462.479 --> 468.8
but yeah i like howdy machowski because

464.4 --> 471.52
he always lays down things so clearly

468.8 --> 473.599
not a lot of like oh whoa this

471.52 --> 475.599
not a lot of attention grabbing this and

473.599 --> 478.0
just like more

475.599 --> 480.639
detailed descriptive and just careful

478.0 --> 481.759
consideration

480.639 --> 486.0
yeah

481.759 --> 486.0
so it was interesting video anyway

490.0 --> 494.24
oh god

491.68 --> 494.24
you again

496.639 --> 500.52
hello sidekicks traveler

506.639 --> 510.879
no no i'm not

508.24 --> 510.879
going to go

517.76 --> 522.88
look

519.36 --> 525.04
marks my layer and his offer his crazy

522.88 --> 527.8389999999999
ass offer

525.04 --> 529.68
it's like even associating

527.839 --> 532.72
with the people that were mentioned like

529.68 --> 535.04
why the hell would you think

532.72 --> 538.72
that i'd be going along with any of that

535.04 --> 538.7199999999999
under any circumstances

539.839 --> 544.48
i i don't understand why you just keep

542.08 --> 548.76
on pushing

544.48 --> 548.76
this nonsense anyway

557.04 --> 560.04
right

571.04 --> 575.56
does anybody who help you

579.6 --> 584.8000000000001
well how is it helping me

582.16 --> 587.4399999999999
trying to force me to do something

584.8 --> 588.88
in with the promise of large money

587.44 --> 591.6800000000001
rewards

588.88 --> 596.24
this doesn't help me

591.68 --> 596.2399999999999
right what helps me is just support

598.0 --> 601.279
i don't want to be snared

601.839 --> 606.0
support has to be unconditional and

603.6 --> 609.32
that's just it that's that's how this is

606.0 --> 609.32
gonna work

620.32 --> 624.32
right and it does work there are

622.64 --> 626.48
supporters

624.32 --> 628.0
there were people even was it yesterday

626.48 --> 630.24
or two days ago

628.0 --> 632.24
they did say like yeah they were gonna

630.24 --> 635.04
support

632.24 --> 637.44
and they said today i really hope

635.04 --> 639.279
they're gonna

637.44 --> 642.8000000000001
yeah hold to what they said because i

639.279 --> 642.8
sure as hell need it right now

642.88 --> 647.6
all right financial situation overall

645.12 --> 649.839
has not

647.6 --> 652.32
grown worse but it hasn't really

649.839 --> 654.0
improved since

652.32 --> 655.6800000000001
well

654.0 --> 659.0
since my computer broke down and had to

655.68 --> 659.0
get it repaired

660.56 --> 665.1999999999999
and i think i could probably

662.88 --> 667.6
go about a little

665.2 --> 670.48
slimmer this month i'm already smoking

667.6 --> 670.48
like a lot less

671.44 --> 677.519
be very very careful with the money that

674.959 --> 677.5189999999999
i have

678.24 --> 685.64
right and like just pretty much food

681.36 --> 685.64
essentials that's it

689.92 --> 693.36
ah hey crockett

693.6 --> 697.399
stallion 80 12.

706.0 --> 711.68
what i mean by ensnared peace dune

709.279 --> 713.4399999999999
is people telling me oh you gotta do

711.68 --> 716.68
this you gotta

713.44 --> 716.6800000000001
do that

716.72 --> 722.639
like join something go somewhere like

719.68 --> 725.519
what the hell was that oh

722.639 --> 728.0
go to a hotel like none of that really

725.519 --> 731.839
even made any damn sense to me

728.0 --> 731.839
it's all just messed up

733.279 --> 736.0
hey agm

742.079 --> 748.0
yes i've heard about that

745.44 --> 750.24
like there there is movement going on

748.0 --> 750.24
right

751.12 --> 757.5600000000001
there's movement going on against the

754.56 --> 757.56
pandemic

760.48 --> 763.6800000000001
is accommodation expensive in the

762.16 --> 766.3199999999999
netherlands yes

763.68 --> 769.3199999999999
starting it starting at 80 12. mostly it

766.32 --> 769.32
is

774.56 --> 779.0
hey getting wisdom good to see you

792.079 --> 796.0
he's got five

793.36 --> 798.32
well okay hey peace dune that sounds

796.0 --> 801.279
great man

798.32 --> 804.8000000000001
look i don't mind living here at all

801.279 --> 804.8
what i do mind is

804.88 --> 809.68
not having enough money to go around so

806.88 --> 811.76
if you're saying your dad

809.68 --> 814.88
wants to send me money

811.76 --> 816.959
well yeah i'll accept as long as it is

814.88 --> 818.88
unconditional

816.959 --> 820.959
it's as simple as that

818.88 --> 823.279
has to be straight out support for my

820.959 --> 827.04
efforts what i do

823.279 --> 828.399
for me to decide to do with what i want

827.04 --> 830.56
i mean you can

828.399 --> 832.16
add requests or anything but

830.56 --> 835.5189999999999
there's there's not going to be any

832.16 --> 837.04
obligations tied into it

835.519 --> 839.279
right because then it would become a

837.04 --> 842.8
contract

839.279 --> 846.48
even verbal or by email doesn't matter

842.8 --> 846.4799999999999
has to be just be a donation

846.88 --> 851.76
and if he's willing to do that

849.12 --> 853.199
in bits or something

851.76 --> 855.8389999999999
i thank you

853.199 --> 858.16
i thank you

855.839 --> 859.12
yeah please excuse that i've been

858.16 --> 861.6
thinking

859.12 --> 863.6
that this marks my lear because

861.6 --> 866.5600000000001
that guy's been stalking me for over a

863.6 --> 867.6800000000001
year through my email and all that

866.56 --> 870.399
and

867.68 --> 871.279
he's been trying to snare me

870.399 --> 875.44
into

871.279 --> 877.68
into engaging in some kind of a contract

875.44 --> 879.9200000000001
that does not

877.68 --> 880.959
seem like in the in my best interest at

879.92 --> 883.8389999999999
all

880.959 --> 886.16
and so yeah every time somebody new

883.839 --> 888.639
comes in and starts doing something like

886.16 --> 890.959
that i kind of automatically think it's

888.639 --> 890.9590000000001
him

892.399 --> 899.839
because he's just unrelenting he won't

895.519 --> 899.839
let it go he keeps on trying

901.92 --> 907.04
can my dad call you later on today uh

907.12 --> 910.839
maybe

908.72 --> 913.9200000000001
you mean on the

910.839 --> 914.8800000000001
show well i'd look i'm not gonna just

913.92 --> 917.12
take an

914.88 --> 919.76
an unknown caller on

917.12 --> 921.839
raw like that

919.76 --> 924.24
it would be nice if yeah if he wants to

921.839 --> 927.44
contact me that's fine you know we we

924.24 --> 929.759
could skype

927.44 --> 932.9590000000001
but yeah

929.759 --> 935.6
not on not just like first call on my

932.959 --> 937.4399999999999
show i'd like to know who i'm facing

935.6 --> 941.44
first

937.44 --> 944.32
but sure i'll i'll take a call fine

941.44 --> 946.8000000000001
once you wreck my beautiful shows okay

944.32 --> 948.48
beautiful show

946.8 --> 950.4799999999999
sometimes it's beautiful i guess

948.48 --> 953.279
sometimes it's very inspiring other

950.48 --> 956.399
times it's kind of

953.279 --> 956.399
ominous maybe

959.44 --> 967.399
and straighten up oh fine peace dude so

964.399 --> 967.399
yeah

971.36 --> 976.88
do you think brian's next reincarnation

973.68 --> 980.079
will be a leprechaun

976.88 --> 980.079
thank you for that crockett

980.399 --> 984.959
uh

983.04 --> 987.12
no i don't think that leprechauns are

984.959 --> 989.199
like

987.12 --> 992.24
literal physical creatures

989.199 --> 994.56
they're not a species

992.24 --> 997.6
they're more like a spirit and brian

994.56 --> 1000.2399999999999
does have a bit of a leprechaun with him

997.6 --> 1000.24
definitely

1001.12 --> 1005.68
but also he's basically

1004.639 --> 1010.6
just

1005.68 --> 1010.5999999999999
raw exploring for himself

1011.36 --> 1017.6
just a very free thinker

1014.399 --> 1020.16
so he's also kind of messing around but

1017.6 --> 1022.0
he's taking his messing around very

1020.16 --> 1023.36
serious and that's the more important

1022.0 --> 1025.76
part

1023.36 --> 1029.3600000000001
and that's why i do my best to respect

1025.76 --> 1032.8799999999999
what he's trying because i myself do

1029.36 --> 1032.8799999999999
that too in my own way

1033.439 --> 1039.24
i am screwing around too but i do it

1035.839 --> 1039.24
very seriously

1039.439 --> 1044.0
i'm exploring

1041.12 --> 1047.6789999999999
i'm exploring what is i'm trying to

1044.0 --> 1050.799
fine-tune and reconfigure

1047.679 --> 1052.48
what i think reality is with the spirit

1050.799 --> 1055.039
energies and the mechanics and

1052.48 --> 1057.84
everything in the design

1055.039 --> 1059.919
and yeah if you're constantly held back

1057.84 --> 1061.6789999999999
by dogma

1059.919 --> 1062.64
or peer pressure

1061.679 --> 1065.2800000000002
then

1062.64 --> 1067.2
you're not going to explore anything

1065.28 --> 1068.6399999999999
you're just gonna be following the same

1067.2 --> 1070.799
old roots

1068.64 --> 1072.64
and then making up excuses why you need

1070.799 --> 1073.9189999999999
to follow the same old roots all the

1072.64 --> 1077.5200000000002
time

1073.919 --> 1080.5200000000002
in mental and spiritual exploration

1077.52 --> 1080.52
so

1082.24 --> 1086.48
huh

1083.36 --> 1086.4799999999998
hello jeff gassett

1092.08 --> 1096.799

1094.4 --> 1100.8400000000001

1096.799 --> 1100.84
don't know who your dad is

1108.0 --> 1111.919
also realize that

1109.84 --> 1114.24
i might have known him

1111.919 --> 1116.72
and had him on skype but uh what is it

1114.24 --> 1119.2
some time ago last year

1116.72 --> 1121.76
i basically lost access to my old skype

1119.2 --> 1124.16
account so i had to switch

1121.76 --> 1126.4
you know man

1124.16 --> 1126.4
uh

1126.96 --> 1132.919
okay

1128.16 --> 1132.919
i'll look i'll look around

1145.28 --> 1150.559
no i don't have anybody blocked

1148.0 --> 1153.2
currently

1150.559 --> 1156.24
so yeah it might have still been

1153.2 --> 1159.039
connected to my old skype

1156.24 --> 1160.559
which i do not use anymore so

1159.039 --> 1162.48
yeah

1160.559 --> 1164.96
just tell him to add

1162.48 --> 1167.2
my new skype right

1164.96 --> 1171.679
which is basically again my email our

1167.2 --> 1171.679
win3 before it used to be

1172.08 --> 1176.6399999999999
uh

1173.679 --> 1178.4
our win with a y not i j

1176.64 --> 1181.5200000000002
seven

1178.4 --> 1183.2
that was my previous skype code now it's

1181.52 --> 1187.44
my email so

1183.2 --> 1187.44
i'll just have to add me again anyway

1190.72 --> 1194.96
hello ermeykin good to see you

1197.44 --> 1203.28
yesterday's flat earth debate was great

1200.88 --> 1204.96
really intense

1203.28 --> 1208.96
again

1204.96 --> 1208.96
but i think i was pretty much on form

1209.12 --> 1213.1999999999998
had a lot of clarity with me for some

1211.12 --> 1216.08
reason

1213.2 --> 1218.32
it's always nice when that happens

1216.08 --> 1218.32
uh

1218.88 --> 1225.2800000000002
right also i have to make mention of

1222.0 --> 1228.159
oh so good made by jim bob made another

1225.28 --> 1232.6399999999999
deep fake clip with jordan peterson and

1228.159 --> 1232.64
ben shapiro and it's so freaking funny

1233.44 --> 1239.919
can't stop rewatching it

1235.919 --> 1239.919
so check that out here's a link

1242.159 --> 1245.2
for one more no i don't want more skype

1244.08 --> 1249.76
accounts

1245.2 --> 1252.72
peace dune yeah what i want is

1249.76 --> 1256.24
interesting conversations

1252.72 --> 1259.679
subjects good questions

1256.24 --> 1259.679
and financial support

1260.159 --> 1264.96
a flatter stage tenth minus age yeah

1267.919 --> 1271.44
a tenth man is pretty awesome

1273.28 --> 1278.8799999999999
brian hates when you're on point yeah

1276.559 --> 1278.8799999999999
little

1279.039 --> 1283.039
oh brian is

1281.12 --> 1285.28
look he's very smart

1283.039 --> 1286.4
but he has a bit of a leprechaun ego

1285.28 --> 1288.48
sometimes

1286.4 --> 1291.52
when he's full of energy he does get

1288.48 --> 1293.44
kind of like jealous

1291.52 --> 1296.24
like he likes to be

1293.44 --> 1298.88
seen as really smart too

1296.24 --> 1300.48
right but it's it's an intuitive thing i

1298.88 --> 1301.919
know how to work with it i'm not

1300.48 --> 1304.799
threatened by it

1301.919 --> 1307.8400000000001
but yeah i get people saying no no no

1304.799 --> 1309.9189999999999
arwyn all the time like even nathan does

1307.84 --> 1312.1589999999999
it everybody there does it like

1309.919 --> 1314.24
literally there's no exceptions even

1312.159 --> 1317.7600000000002
adam does it sometimes

1314.24 --> 1320.08
and then afterward you have to admit

1317.76 --> 1322.0
like yeah maybe you did have a bit of a

1320.08 --> 1325.36
point

1322.0 --> 1325.36
everybody does it there

1326.559 --> 1330.8799999999999
and hey i do i am very raw at what i do

1329.919 --> 1333.679
so

1330.88 --> 1337.44
it's only to be expected i expect people

1333.679 --> 1339.52
to say no no no no at first

1337.44 --> 1342.72
because i do kind of crash into the

1339.52 --> 1344.72
place with an idea sometimes anyway

1342.72 --> 1348.24
leprechaun egos yeah

1344.72 --> 1348.24
the circles prove it

1348.559 --> 1354.72
oh god you mean polonium circles okay

1352.64 --> 1356.96
let's think outside of the polonium sir

1354.72 --> 1359.1200000000001
but that's a good one

1356.96 --> 1361.039
yeah

1359.12 --> 1363.9189999999999
no but yesterday with the polonium

1361.039 --> 1367.039
circles that was just like

1363.919 --> 1369.039
conceptually fractal

1367.039 --> 1371.2
it was like okay let's presuppose the

1369.039 --> 1373.6
heliocentric model

1371.2 --> 1376.32
and then what excuse do we find for its

1373.6 --> 1376.32
existence

1377.52 --> 1381.679
as yeah as a helios interest to fix the

1380.159 --> 1383.1200000000001
story

1381.679 --> 1385.679
and then

1383.12 --> 1388.32
that jumped off into further deeper

1385.679 --> 1390.96
ridicule like it's all real and yeah i

1388.32 --> 1393.28
didn't really i wasn't expecting that

1390.96 --> 1395.44
i would at least i was expecting that as

1393.28 --> 1398.24
like a joke but not as a running joke so

1395.44 --> 1401.2
i was kind of like uh what what

1398.24 --> 1403.76
i was really confused

1401.2 --> 1406.24
the panel kind of flustered me like they

1403.76 --> 1408.72
would fluster rumpus in the old days he

1406.24 --> 1411.039
would get like that too it was so deep

1408.72 --> 1412.48
into his conceptions

1411.039 --> 1414.08
that he would take it very seriously he

1412.48 --> 1415.76
would really believe it and if he then

1414.08 --> 1416.3999999999999
[ __ ] around with it he would just get

1415.76 --> 1418.72
like

1416.4 --> 1418.72
what

1419.679 --> 1423.44
and yeah i get a bit like that too

1422.0 --> 1424.72
when i'm like

1423.44 --> 1426.3200000000002
deep

1424.72 --> 1427.919
into

1426.32 --> 1431.84
the train of thinking

1427.919 --> 1431.8400000000001
but yeah yesterday it was funny

1436.32 --> 1439.52
oh here we go again

1440.4 --> 1444.52
ah no adam meekin

1447.52 --> 1451.0
hello wrath

1466.72 --> 1471.6000000000001
chosen one good seal

1469.679 --> 1474.7
ah

1471.6 --> 1474.6999999999998
[Music]

1499.76 --> 1504.1589999999999
any new discoveries

1502.48 --> 1505.1200000000001
uh no

1504.159 --> 1507.679
not

1505.12 --> 1510.799
not particularly

1507.679 --> 1515.0
i mean yesterday's show i

1510.799 --> 1515.0
kind of figured something out

1515.52 --> 1518.96
about the the asylums

1517.919 --> 1521.679
the late

1518.96 --> 1524.72
the 1800s and all that

1521.679 --> 1528.6000000000001
and what they were probably really for

1524.72 --> 1528.6000000000001
and why they were haunted

1529.919 --> 1535.5200000000002
right but is that a discovery no it's

1532.24 --> 1538.0
more like a realization like wait

1535.52 --> 1540.24
this is not what it seems

1538.0 --> 1542.24
and there's already been suspicions of

1540.24 --> 1544.32
things like that but then if you place

1542.24 --> 1546.0
it into the wider context of everything

1544.32 --> 1548.96
we've learned and

1546.0 --> 1550.159
deeper propaganda programs

1548.96 --> 1552.96
and like

1550.159 --> 1555.679
propaganda reset of history

1552.96 --> 1558.799
then it makes a lot more sense

1555.679 --> 1558.799
why it was so bad

1559.36 --> 1564.0
right but yeah that that's it that could

1561.919 --> 1566.96
be considered a new

1564.0 --> 1566.96
discovery but

1567.44 --> 1571.2
see if good government testing well

1569.2 --> 1572.96
maybe that too

1571.2 --> 1574.88
but it was

1572.96 --> 1578.08
predominantly

1574.88 --> 1578.0800000000002
political prisons

1578.4 --> 1582.48
to get the right free thinkers that

1580.799 --> 1586.32
would understand what was really

1582.48 --> 1590.32
happening that were trying to maintain

1586.32 --> 1590.32
clarity with ancient knowledge

1590.72 --> 1594.48
that they get those people completely

1592.64 --> 1595.919
out of the way so they could basically

1594.48 --> 1598.799
weave their

1595.919 --> 1601.44
historically reconstruction spell

1598.799 --> 1603.44
historical reconstruction spell

1601.44 --> 1604.4
without the general public that would

1603.44 --> 1606.64
bite

1604.4 --> 1608.799
getting too distracted

1606.64 --> 1611.279
by the ancient knowledge so i think that

1608.799 --> 1612.72
a lot of very smart and good and wise

1611.279 --> 1614.0
people

1612.72 --> 1616.559
or maybe

1614.0 --> 1620.08
not so much wise but very smart and

1616.559 --> 1622.48
good-natured people spin spirited people

1620.08 --> 1625.279
were probably politically

1622.48 --> 1628.08
arrested under the guise of being insane

1625.279 --> 1630.08
and then locked away

1628.08 --> 1631.6789999999999
and they would

1630.08 --> 1634.32
know

1631.679 --> 1636.24
themselves like what's happened

1634.32 --> 1638.08
and that's terror that's hell they're

1636.24 --> 1641.039
like

1638.08 --> 1644.6399999999999
in prison for ancient knowledge

1641.039 --> 1646.799
like put it put in a dungeon

1644.64 --> 1650.88
when they had so much to communicate to

1646.799 --> 1650.8799999999999
the world right very torturous

1652.72 --> 1656.159
so

1653.6 --> 1658.399
yeah that was one thing

1656.159 --> 1658.3990000000001
uh

1658.559 --> 1661.52
hey jason brown

1661.919 --> 1666.159
space truckers ah yeah

1664.24 --> 1669.039
yeah that's a that's a good flick isn't

1666.159 --> 1671.6000000000001
it jason brown for the time especially

1669.039 --> 1674.24
it's like really good effects for a

1671.6 --> 1674.24
movie that's

1675.12 --> 1677.36
yeah

1677.6 --> 1684.399
that's not even taking itself as serious

1682.0 --> 1688.08
but it's surprising how how good the the

1684.399 --> 1688.08
special effects are in that movie

1688.72 --> 1692.08
non-stop adventure yeah

1692.799 --> 1697.679
one-third distance to the sun that

1694.399 --> 1699.36
that's a liv no leprechaun the rainbow

1697.679 --> 1703.1200000000001
right

1699.36 --> 1704.9599999999998
exactly yeah the the gold pots are

1703.12 --> 1706.559
are

1704.96 --> 1708.24
exactly

1706.559 --> 1710.32
1au way

1708.24 --> 1712.72
right the rainbow is pretty much up to

1710.32 --> 1715.36
1au

1712.72 --> 1717.52
but yeah since it ends

1715.36 --> 1721.039
in a pot of gold according to the legend

1717.52 --> 1722.1589999999999
the pot of gold is one a exactly 1au

1721.039 --> 1723.76
away

1722.159 --> 1726.72
apparent distance

1723.76 --> 1726.72
or winning unit

1737.36 --> 1740.32
yeah chosen one

1740.799 --> 1748.32
that's three au to the sun two au to the

1743.679 --> 1748.3200000000002
moon and one to a rainbow that's right

1748.399 --> 1753.84
it's apparent distances

1751.2 --> 1753.8400000000001
not actual

1762.32 --> 1767.48
oh yeah an au also happens to be

1769.76 --> 1776.44
the material designation

1772.0 --> 1776.44
for gold by the way

1780.32 --> 1786.799
the chemical i mean yeah the chemical

1784.08 --> 1791.96
symbol for gold

1786.799 --> 1791.96
are we star queen units oh god

1804.799 --> 1809.6
right well crockett if you're going to

1806.84 --> 1812.24
introduce seemingly

1809.6 --> 1816.48
as folly

1812.24 --> 1819.279
a concept that specifically is there

1816.48 --> 1822.0
to help assist people bypass their

1819.279 --> 1824.0
physicality assumption bias which is a

1822.0 --> 1825.679
psychological and therefore stress

1824.0 --> 1827.6
related obstacle

1825.679 --> 1829.1200000000001
then yeah you better keep it really

1827.6 --> 1832.8799999999999
simple

1829.12 --> 1835.9189999999999
because the more complicated it gets

1832.88 --> 1837.279
the the tougher it is to actually assist

1835.919 --> 1839.76
you in

1837.279 --> 1843.44
understanding that some things are not

1839.76 --> 1843.44
physically in literal spaces

1844.32 --> 1850.9189999999999
literal positions so yeah the au system

1847.36 --> 1850.9189999999999
is very simple

1851.36 --> 1856.7199999999998
right and there is even technically room

1854.32 --> 1858.48
to be honestly simple because apparent

1856.72 --> 1861.3600000000001
distance is

1858.48 --> 1863.279
like yeah it it becomes completely

1861.36 --> 1865.519
arbitrary because there is no actual

1863.279 --> 1867.36
distances so it's only

1865.519 --> 1869.1200000000001
seeming distances well that can

1867.36 --> 1871.039
technically be anything you can make it

1869.12 --> 1874.1589999999999
as simple as as complicated or as

1871.039 --> 1874.1589999999999
complicated as you like

1874.72 --> 1878.3990000000001
but since

1876.24 --> 1881.2
i'm trying to assist humanity into

1878.399 --> 1885.399
overcoming physicality assumption bias i

1881.2 --> 1885.3990000000001
chose to keep it really simple

1893.84 --> 1896.559
oh god

1896.799 --> 1900.0
okay you guys here yeah

1900.159 --> 1904.0800000000002
still working

1901.519 --> 1904.08
down there

1905.279 --> 1909.12
i really hope they're going to be done

1906.799 --> 1909.12
soon

1918.32 --> 1921.279
god

1919.2 --> 1924.0
nathan is in a

1921.279 --> 1924.0
silly mood

1932.88 --> 1935.8400000000001
ah

1945.44 --> 1949.919
oh yeah by the way somebody

1947.6 --> 1953.12
said infowars

1949.919 --> 1954.64
some point a picture flew by

1953.12 --> 1956.6399999999999
showing

1954.64 --> 1959.76
michael jackson

1956.64 --> 1964.3990000000001
his face in like his his latest years

1959.76 --> 1966.32
and then nancy pelosi right next to it

1964.399 --> 1969.76
that was weird

1966.32 --> 1971.279
because the similarities are like

1969.76 --> 1974.279
surreal

1971.279 --> 1974.279
serious

1976.88 --> 1980.96
something you don't really expect

1978.96 --> 1986.279
to lay that connection

1980.96 --> 1986.279
but visually that's like very similar

1991.2 --> 1995.3600000000001
construction going on nearby no it's

1993.2 --> 1999.6000000000001
downstairs

1995.36 --> 1999.6
they're like rebuilding the bathroom

2001.36 --> 2006.24
and it's been going for a while now

2003.519 --> 2007.519
although the biggest noise

2006.24 --> 2010.08
is over

2007.519 --> 2011.6
which was like the removing of the old

2010.08 --> 2013.76
stuff

2011.6 --> 2015.6789999999999
the tiles and all that

2013.76 --> 2018.72
that was a lot of noise now but they're

2015.679 --> 2021.72
still like drilling and [ __ ]

2018.72 --> 2021.72
assembling

2033.36 --> 2036.57
[Music]

2038.159 --> 2042.919
pj in the house no he's not here

2047.84 --> 2052.48
okay michael jackson the king of

2049.839 --> 2052.48
disguise

2053.28 --> 2058.159
now kevlar i'm not stating that i

2056.079 --> 2060.96
actually believe that they are the same

2058.159 --> 2062.48
person it's just that they the way it

2060.96 --> 2065.04
looks is like

2062.48 --> 2068.2400000000002
holy [ __ ]

2065.04 --> 2070.399
you don't anticipate those faces looking

2068.24 --> 2072.24
so similar as they really do when you

2070.399 --> 2073.5989999999997
put them together that's really the

2072.24 --> 2075.7599999999998
thing

2073.599 --> 2076.7200000000003
not saying it's the same person not

2075.76 --> 2079.679
gonna go

2076.72 --> 2079.6789999999996
that silly route

2080.079 --> 2083.2000000000003
all right

2081.76 --> 2087.679
besides hey

2083.2 --> 2089.5989999999997
people in the world looking similar oh

2087.679 --> 2092.2400000000002
that never happens oh wait yeah it

2089.599 --> 2093.76
happens all the time

2092.24 --> 2097.399
so

2093.76 --> 2097.3990000000003
some more than others

2111.44 --> 2113.92
so one

2114.839 --> 2120.24
this the conversation is dilapidating

2121.2 --> 2124.64
that's all fine if you guys want to goof

2123.68 --> 2128.52
around

2124.64 --> 2128.52
that's okay with me

2139.359 --> 2144.119
i'll entertain most things

2146.24 --> 2153.04
yeah but not if they're blatantly

2148.0 --> 2153.04
nonsensical or like impossible to prove

2153.68 --> 2159.2799999999997
like there has to be a point

2156.56 --> 2161.7599999999998
right

2159.28 --> 2163.6800000000003
like what is the point of thinking that

2161.76 --> 2165.3590000000004
nancy pelosi and michael jackson would

2163.68 --> 2168.0
be the same person what the hell would

2165.359 --> 2168.0
be the point

2168.72 --> 2173.3199999999997
this

2170.0 --> 2173.32
it's pointless

2179.68 --> 2182.16
ray mirs

2181.28 --> 2184.48
nathan

2182.16 --> 2186.48
i don't even know who that is

2184.48 --> 2188.8
who is this nathan oakley you're talking

2186.48 --> 2192.52
about no just kidding the rey mirrors i

2188.8 --> 2192.52
don't know who that is

2203.839 --> 2208.88
will smith

2205.68 --> 2212.52
no but that's just straight out [ __ ]

2208.88 --> 2212.52
there's nothing alike

2221.44 --> 2224.48
oh they look

2225.04 --> 2229.2
they have very different skulls

2227.76 --> 2231.0400000000004
okay

2229.2 --> 2233.5989999999997
michael jackson

2231.04 --> 2234.96
especially how he used to be

2233.599 --> 2238.3590000000004
compared to will smith they have

2234.96 --> 2238.359
different skulls

2249.599 --> 2251.92
what

2252.56 --> 2256.48
okay i'm i'm just

2254.4 --> 2259.839
lost now

2256.48 --> 2259.839
look i don't know who that is

2264.96 --> 2271.839
a british guy oh wow well that

2267.76 --> 2271.8390000000004
immediately explains it

2279.68 --> 2284.5989999999997
david jackson what the [ __ ]

2296.4 --> 2301.76
no look guys i don't want to waste time

2298.24 --> 2301.7599999999998
on that sort of nonsense come on

2302.16 --> 2307.5989999999997
it's just pointless distractions this is

2304.64 --> 2309.5989999999997
like playing with

2307.599 --> 2311.839
transformers

2309.599 --> 2314.48
transformer toys

2311.839 --> 2316.96
except it's superstars and then oh look

2314.48 --> 2318.48
one turns out to be the other

2316.96 --> 2319.599
transform it

2318.48 --> 2322.2400000000002
see

2319.599 --> 2324.2400000000002
like why why why'd you do that

2322.24 --> 2326.4799999999996
it's

2324.24 --> 2328.16
it's a point it seems like a pointless

2326.48 --> 2330.8
distraction

2328.16 --> 2333.68
it's like what what are you even gonna

2330.8 --> 2337.8
learn as a skill by doing that by

2333.68 --> 2337.7999999999997
spending your time doing that

2339.38 --> 2342.57
[Music]

2353.839 --> 2356.839
anyway

2364.17 --> 2367.63
[Music]

2369.839 --> 2373.839
do you believe in aliens

2374.32 --> 2377.3590000000004
uh

2375.119 --> 2377.359
no

2378.96 --> 2382.7200000000003
not by any

2380.48 --> 2385.04
official standards anyway

2382.72 --> 2388.0
think aliens

2385.04 --> 2392.16
yeah if you're gonna say aliens grounded

2388.0 --> 2395.48
in the same route as the heliocentrism

2392.16 --> 2395.48
then no

2396.72 --> 2400.9599999999996
do i think that there might be extra

2398.72 --> 2401.9199999999996
dimensional spirits

2400.96 --> 2403.359
that

2401.92 --> 2406.64
for some reason

2403.359 --> 2408.319
visually seem to manifest like aliens in

2406.64 --> 2409.52
certain

2408.319 --> 2410.8
dream

2409.52 --> 2415.7599999999998
or

2410.8 --> 2415.76
uh drug-induced experiences yeah sure

2416.0 --> 2420.48
do i think that

2417.92 --> 2423.599
they could be considered

2420.48 --> 2425.68
wanting to invade our world

2423.599 --> 2427.119
yeah

2425.68 --> 2429.04
they're not gonna do it physically

2427.119 --> 2432.4
though

2429.04 --> 2434.319
gonna do it through people

2432.4 --> 2437.28
they're on the other side

2434.319 --> 2438.4
they connect up with people

2437.28 --> 2440.7200000000003
they might

2438.4 --> 2442.64
like tell them things help them out

2440.72 --> 2444.64
spiritually or

2442.64 --> 2447.44
with ideas

2444.64 --> 2450.56
with all kinds of

2447.44 --> 2454.079
back door issues probably when they do

2450.56 --> 2456.16
they yeah that's usually how that works

2454.079 --> 2459.599
and then the people are basically going

2456.16 --> 2461.359
to carry out what they want

2459.599 --> 2464.56
because aliens

2461.359 --> 2465.44
are not physical creatures

2464.56 --> 2468.4
like

2465.44 --> 2470.96
yeah they cannot just start manifesting

2468.4 --> 2470.96
physically

2471.2 --> 2477.68
from the extra dimensional dark world

2474.48 --> 2480.96
dreamscape existence into the physical

2477.68 --> 2482.96
world that's unless it's a mockery setup

2480.96 --> 2484.8
unless it's an act

2482.96 --> 2487.2
somebody's pretending that and they're

2484.8 --> 2487.2000000000003
making

2488.319 --> 2492.319
systems

2489.839 --> 2495.839
to give the appearance like as if it

2492.319 --> 2498.16
were a literal alien invasion but any

2495.839 --> 2500.24
physical manifestations

2498.16 --> 2503.2
of alien visions

2500.24 --> 2508.2
supposedly or any hint thereof are all

2503.2 --> 2508.2
man-made all of them no exception

2509.2 --> 2514.319
aliens are not physically

2510.8 --> 2514.319
self-sufficient entities

2514.88 --> 2519.0
hope that clarifies that

2538.88 --> 2543.92
yeah and extraterrestrials yeah that's

2541.599 --> 2543.92
cute

2546.16 --> 2550.8799999999997
yeah there might be more lands well if

2548.56 --> 2552.0789999999997
there is it's either going to be rough

2550.88 --> 2555.839
wilderness

2552.079 --> 2555.8390000000004
or it's going to be occupied by man

2556.48 --> 2560.16
very certain

2558.16 --> 2561.52
that the way things have developed here

2560.16 --> 2565.2799999999997
in this realm

2561.52 --> 2568.48
that mankind in different ages has seen

2565.28 --> 2570.7200000000003
all places on earth

2568.48 --> 2573.28
and tried to cultivate probably every

2570.72 --> 2574.24
region at some point

2573.28 --> 2576.3190000000004
so

2574.24 --> 2579.2799999999997
we're not gonna come across some

2576.319 --> 2580.8
completely different alien species

2579.28 --> 2583.119
unless

2580.8 --> 2584.319
we're entering virgin grounds

2583.119 --> 2586.2400000000002
like say

2584.319 --> 2588.24
for example

2586.24 --> 2590.24
not taking any

2588.24 --> 2593.68
people not taking suggestions from this

2590.24 --> 2596.9599999999996
outside but let's say

2593.68 --> 2598.3999999999996
we explored the realm downward and

2596.96 --> 2600.16
suddenly

2598.4 --> 2602.319
and like really

2600.16 --> 2604.839
noticeably for the first time ever

2602.319 --> 2608.4
because of unique signs that come with

2604.839 --> 2609.68
it we dig into a completely new

2608.4 --> 2611.76
realmscape

2609.68 --> 2614.16
like a giant cave it might be called

2611.76 --> 2616.88
shale but like a direct

2614.16 --> 2619.7599999999998
official connection no rumors

2616.88 --> 2622.7200000000003
no giant cave systems and that maybe

2619.76 --> 2625.76
somewhere it's rumored to end up in that

2622.72 --> 2627.9199999999996
but a direct connection while there a

2625.76 --> 2630.8
place that man has never gone before yes

2627.92 --> 2632.8
we might find

2630.8 --> 2636.6400000000003
other creatures there

2632.8 --> 2636.6400000000003
maybe even humanoid creatures

2637.119 --> 2642.48
but they could also just be humans or

2639.359 --> 2646.5989999999997
proto-humans are pre pre there might be

2642.48 --> 2646.599
like the predecessor species

2648.16 --> 2650.7999999999997
like

2648.96 --> 2651.839
giants

2650.8 --> 2653.44
or

2651.839 --> 2655.2799999999997
like half giants

2653.44 --> 2657.76
our predecessors

2655.28 --> 2659.76
might still be there something or it

2657.76 --> 2661.28
could be like completely different types

2659.76 --> 2662.8
of species maybe they're like really

2661.28 --> 2665.0400000000004
creepy

2662.8 --> 2665.04
like

2665.839 --> 2670.4
almost insectoid

2667.839 --> 2672.319
type intelligent creatures like what we

2670.4 --> 2673.2000000000003
would see is aliens

2672.319 --> 2676.88
right

2673.2 --> 2681.2
like from the movie aliens or

2676.88 --> 2683.28
or like the shadows from babylon 5.

2681.2 --> 2686.319
there might all be other

2683.28 --> 2687.2000000000003
types of species physical species out

2686.319 --> 2688.0
there

2687.2 --> 2689.7599999999998
but

2688.0 --> 2691.599
in the realm and everything that is

2689.76 --> 2692.48
through the open air connected to our

2691.599 --> 2694.8
realm

2692.48 --> 2698.52
no we're not gonna find any of that

2694.8 --> 2698.52
pretty sure we won't

2712.96 --> 2717.04
although another possibility would be

2714.96 --> 2720.2400000000002
that another species is holed up

2717.04 --> 2723.119
somewhere where they basically built a

2720.24 --> 2724.9599999999996
megalithic impenetrable indestructible

2723.119 --> 2727.6800000000003
fortress

2724.96 --> 2729.119
where they live inside and they never

2727.68 --> 2731.44
come out

2729.119 --> 2734.319
and we can't get in and we can scan

2731.44 --> 2737.359
through etc right

2734.319 --> 2740.319
because that would be a decided upon

2737.359 --> 2742.64
permanent barrier

2740.319 --> 2744.96
but if it's directly open openly

2742.64 --> 2746.56
connected in the realm through the air

2744.96 --> 2748.64
there's no way there's no way we're

2746.56 --> 2754.119
gonna find a completely alien

2748.64 --> 2754.1189999999997
non-humanoid type species no way

2762.16 --> 2768.8799999999997
men in black is a documentary uh

2766.64 --> 2768.8799999999997
no

2773.119 --> 2777.319
it is an interesting movie though

2797.88 --> 2801.44
extraterrestrial beings they hadn't

2799.599 --> 2802.7200000000003
gotten it what you're saying there's a

2801.44 --> 2805.119
difference

2802.72 --> 2805.1189999999997
really

2811.2 --> 2815.7599999999998
i didn't know there was like a

2813.52 --> 2818.4
an official difference

2815.76 --> 2818.4
that's weird

2823.119 --> 2826.88
and i get a skype message

2826.079 --> 2828.0
from

2826.88 --> 2829.44
boris

2828.0 --> 2830.48
cash

2829.44 --> 2831.76
sam

2830.48 --> 2834.56
no

2831.76 --> 2836.88
no i have not received

2834.56 --> 2836.88
any

2838.24 --> 2841.4799999999996
hold on

2847.2 --> 2850.5589999999997
no i

2848.24 --> 2853.359
yeah peace dune i have not received any

2850.559 --> 2856.6800000000003
new skype messages or people adding me i

2853.359 --> 2856.68
just checked

2867.44 --> 2869.92

right so since we're at the

2936.559 --> 2941.52
halfway point of the show i'm gonna use

2939.04 --> 2943.44
the opportunity again

2941.52 --> 2945.44
to e back

2943.44 --> 2947.04
because i really need it

2945.44 --> 2949.52

2947.04 --> 2951.839
appreciated the show so far

2949.52 --> 2953.44
anybody watching afterward also right

i'm not just

2953.44 --> 2958.2400000000002
when i do this i'm not addressing people

2955.359 --> 2960.72
necessarily live in chat or anything

2958.24 --> 2961.5989999999997
i'm addressing everybody that's watching

2960.72 --> 2963.9199999999996
and

2961.599 --> 2965.28
likes to watch my show afterward

2963.92 --> 2967.2000000000003
because yeah

2965.28 --> 2970.96
the show runs

2967.2 --> 2974.0789999999997
because i am sufficiently fed and kept

2970.96 --> 2976.0
happy basically i don't need a lot

2974.079 --> 2980.079
it's not like oh i get more funding so i

2976.0 --> 2981.92
get more like more more more thank god i

2980.079 --> 2985.76
learned my lesson about that sort of

2981.92 --> 2988.16
thing when i was a teen

2985.76 --> 2990.0
but yeah i've had some financial setback

2988.16 --> 2993.52
because my computer broke down it cost

2990.0 --> 2995.04
me yeah literally 360 euros which is a

2993.52 --> 2997.839
lot

2995.04 --> 3000.4
but my computer is fixed and

2997.839 --> 3002.72
it's working really well it's gonna last

3000.4 --> 3005.28
the time

3002.72 --> 3006.7999999999997
i think i can maybe get going another 10

3005.28 --> 3009.599
years

3006.8 --> 3012.2400000000002
hopefully or five or something but it's

3009.599 --> 3014.1600000000003
working smoothly everything is smooth

3012.24 --> 3017.04
it's almost like forgotten how smooth

3014.16 --> 3019.44
the computer can actually run

3017.04 --> 3021.52
and it's working very smooth right now

3019.44 --> 3023.92
so that problem is fixed for the time

3021.52 --> 3025.599
being but yeah my financial situation is

3023.92 --> 3028.2400000000002
not

3025.599 --> 3030.7200000000003
i'm on the edge of being broke

3028.24 --> 3031.839
i can still do groceries this afternoon

3030.72 --> 3036.0789999999997
and then

3031.839 --> 3036.0789999999997
i'm out then i got nothing left

3038.559 --> 3044.3190000000004
right including for food

3041.04 --> 3048.4
so i really need to support if you do

3044.319 --> 3050.24
happen to have something available

3048.4 --> 3052.48
i've heard some people earlier in the

3050.24 --> 3054.8799999999997
week say that they would get in

3052.48 --> 3055.92
finances this friday so i'm really

3054.88 --> 3057.44
hoping

3055.92 --> 3059.76
they're gonna do that

3057.44 --> 3059.76
soon

3062.0 --> 3066.4
because then i can basically lay down my

3064.48 --> 3069.28
worries

3066.4 --> 3072.96
and continuing well using this pretty

3069.28 --> 3075.2000000000003
clear energy that i do have in this time

3072.96 --> 3076.88
thank god in contrast to like last month

3075.2 --> 3078.48
where i was all stressed out all the

3076.88 --> 3080.48
time and sick

3078.48 --> 3082.559
in the morning i've corrected my diet a

3080.48 --> 3084.2400000000002
little in my habits and now i've got

3082.559 --> 3087.3590000000004
things tuned

3084.24 --> 3087.359
more finely again

3087.68 --> 3093.5989999999997
right but yeah the financial issue does

3090.0 --> 3093.599
remain i need the support

3095.44 --> 3100.96
i could like really use like 50 to 100

3099.2 --> 3103.4399999999996
euros right now i know

3100.96 --> 3108.28
that sounds a lot well this is the

3103.44 --> 3108.28
netherlands things are expensive here

3110.88 --> 3115.2000000000003
and

3111.76 --> 3117.76
i spent my money wisely

3115.2 --> 3118.96
do not blow it on anything only what i

3117.76 --> 3121.119
really need

3118.96 --> 3121.119
so

3122.559 --> 3128.88
yeah i hope i'll get some response soon

3125.599 --> 3130.319
that would be very relieving

3128.88 --> 3131.4700000000003
because it is kind of wearing on my

3130.319 --> 3134.62
nerves a bit

3131.47 --> 3134.62
[Music]

3135.839 --> 3139.04
ah service day right oh your bike's

3137.92 --> 3142.4
still

3139.04 --> 3146.68
it's it's still broken now that sucks

3142.4 --> 3146.6800000000003
oh just take care of it man

3157.52 --> 3163.88
all right yeah len lunch i've seen that

3159.599 --> 3163.88
video too yeah i remember

3172.559 --> 3177.92
was it a space shuttle

3174.8 --> 3177.92
i thought it was like an

3178.079 --> 3182.079
a

3179.76 --> 3184.3190000000004
space station the inside of a space

3182.079 --> 3186.1600000000003
station

3184.319 --> 3187.44
that they were supposedly going to

3186.16 --> 3191.44
launch

3187.44 --> 3193.44
they would send you money in 10 hours oh

3191.44 --> 3195.359
all right guns have never owned i really

3193.44 --> 3198.2400000000002
hope so

3195.359 --> 3198.24
that would be great

3199.04 --> 3201.52
thank you

3205.119 --> 3208.92
hello delta spirit

3214.96 --> 3220.2
two shuttles okay well maybe he saw a

3216.8 --> 3220.2000000000003
different video

3222.079 --> 3225.079
interesting

3237.68 --> 3245.0
finance is the worst conceptual problem

3239.76 --> 3245.0
ever invented yeah tell me about it

3255.52 --> 3259.599
well you know

3256.8 --> 3262.079
but finance in general it has

3259.599 --> 3264.559
it had does have advantages

3262.079 --> 3266.6400000000003
and it has disadvantages it has just

3264.559 --> 3269.28
about as much advantages as it has

3266.64 --> 3271.7599999999998
disadvantages

3269.28 --> 3275.52
the advantages is that you can subtly

3271.76 --> 3275.5200000000004
get mobilize a lot of people

3277.119 --> 3281.04
easily and quickly

3279.92 --> 3283.28
based on

3281.04 --> 3284.88
promised return effectively that's what

3283.28 --> 3285.8390000000004
it was

3284.88 --> 3287.599
right

3285.839 --> 3290.799
but on the other hand

3287.599 --> 3293.2000000000003
you can also enslave people based on

3290.799 --> 3294.4
that same system

3293.2 --> 3296.5589999999997
by

3294.4 --> 3298.64
taking away their mains means of

3296.559 --> 3300.0
self-sufficient

3298.64 --> 3302.319
living

3300.0 --> 3305.04
and then making them dependent on the

3302.319 --> 3308.079
financial promise system

3305.04 --> 3309.68
and then yeah staring them with it so

3308.079 --> 3315.119
yeah it's both

3309.68 --> 3319.3999999999996
huge advantages and huge disadvantages

3315.119 --> 3319.4
it's literally a mixed bag

3327.92 --> 3331.92
there are lots of jobs available where

3329.68 --> 3335.64
you are i

3331.92 --> 3335.64
i don't know actually

3344.72 --> 3349.04
i don't really even keep too much track

3347.2 --> 3353.2
of that anymore

3349.04 --> 3353.2
i've just been focusing on this

3354.799 --> 3359.599
my show on the flyers debates on

3357.68 --> 3361.52
keeping track of what's going on in the

3359.599 --> 3364.4
world

3361.52 --> 3365.92
and yeah trying to highlight things that

3364.4 --> 3367.839
i figure out

3365.92 --> 3369.76
structural insights

3367.839 --> 3371.599
i don't really keep track of like the

3369.76 --> 3372.7200000000003
job markets over here

3371.599 --> 3374.88
too much

3372.72 --> 3377.9199999999996
i mean if i get some kind of a hint then

3374.88 --> 3380.48
i might relay it

3377.92 --> 3382.16
it's not like on the top of my list of

3380.48 --> 3384.88
priority

3382.16 --> 3384.8799999999997
things to know

3385.2 --> 3391.359
job required jabs well that's another

3387.359 --> 3393.5989999999997
reason why i'm not too eager to go out

3391.359 --> 3396.96
and explore because i'm expecting to

3393.599 --> 3399.76
bump into that and that would probably

3396.96 --> 3402.079
shatter my mood

3399.76 --> 3404.6400000000003
like if i bump into that that would be

3402.079 --> 3408.4
like demoralizing to me

3404.64 --> 3409.7599999999998
sounds weird right but it is

3408.4 --> 3411.839
because that would mean that other

3409.76 --> 3414.7200000000003
people would bump into it too and some

3411.839 --> 3415.92
might actually go for that

3414.72 --> 3419.839
it's just

3415.92 --> 3419.839
it makes me feel kind of miserable

3421.44 --> 3427.839
but yeah maybe it's not that bad

3425.52 --> 3429.599
i don't know

3427.839 --> 3431.52
i'm not really looking right now i'm

3429.599 --> 3435.2000000000003
just doing my show and doing the flat

3431.52 --> 3435.2
earth debates keeping track

3438.0 --> 3443.92
can you see if you got my email okay

3440.0 --> 3443.92
well i can definitely check my email

3450.72 --> 3454.24
okay i did receive your email

3456.88 --> 3461.04
can you send me yours the skype address

3459.359 --> 3463.2
is right there

3461.04 --> 3464.079
it's right there in the chat or i mean

3463.2 --> 3466.48
in the

3464.079 --> 3469.88
description box it's the first sentence

3466.48 --> 3469.88
it's right there

3490.96 --> 3495.2400000000002
i mean i don't know what else to do

3511.76 --> 3517.8390000000004
hello lydia logs

3514.319 --> 3517.839
jogs i mean

3530.24 --> 3536.52
you don't know how to use skype

3532.799 --> 3536.52
it's not that difficult

3551.44 --> 3556.64
but look if you have a skype

3554.559 --> 3558.799
address

3556.64 --> 3561.44
already because you do have to have that

3558.799 --> 3564.799
in order to even use skype

3561.44 --> 3567.04
then i could add you i know how to do

3564.799 --> 3567.04
that

3570.96 --> 3576.7200000000003
so if you email me

3573.44 --> 3576.7200000000003
your skype address

3577.599 --> 3580.7200000000003
then i'll add you

3582.72 --> 3587.839
you know how to use skype oh all right

3584.88 --> 3587.839
all right

3598.96 --> 3603.359
it's gonna use digital transfers

3606.48 --> 3608.96
what the

3611.04 --> 3614.92
oh my god that sucks

3624.16 --> 3629.1189999999997
but yeah surface date look

3627.04 --> 3631.2799999999997
wouldn't it be possible

3629.119 --> 3632.4
let's not talk about that in sky like

3631.28 --> 3634.0
over

3632.4 --> 3636.079
during the hangout but

3634.0 --> 3638.96
there might be a way you could basically

3636.079 --> 3640.799
get a separate a separate private

3638.96 --> 3643.359
account

3640.799 --> 3645.599
that could receive digital money

3643.359 --> 3645.5989999999997
right

3645.68 --> 3649.0
i don't know

3656.559 --> 3660.559
right there might be other solutions

3658.559 --> 3662.2400000000002
maybe some of the

3660.559 --> 3664.48
yeah somebody there

3662.24 --> 3667.2799999999997
would be willing to basically be the

3664.48 --> 3668.48
in-between person

3667.28 --> 3670.96
and

3668.48 --> 3674.16
accept the digital currency

3670.96 --> 3678.68
for you and then give you the cash

3674.16 --> 3678.68
to be the middleman who knows

3690.319 --> 3693.319
do

3708.96 --> 3711.96
ah

3800.72 --> 3806.5989999999997
okay i don't know why you're now adding

3802.88 --> 3806.599
two different accounts

3830.6 --> 3833.699
[Music]

3848.48 --> 3854.079
yeah by the way your icon it's really

3851.52 --> 3857.599
[ __ ] up creepy

3854.079 --> 3857.599
do not appreciate that

3863.68 --> 3867.839
ah

3864.96 --> 3867.839
right

3877.039 --> 3882.3190000000004
okay peace doing fine

3880.079 --> 3887.6800000000003
but yeah this better be worth it because

3882.319 --> 3887.68
this is taking up a chunk of my show now

3889.2 --> 3893.1189999999997
if it's just gonna be like a sales pitch

3891.2 --> 3895.52
or anything it's gonna really piss me

3893.119 --> 3897.039
off

3895.52 --> 3900.0
anyway

3897.039 --> 3903.4
let's move on still got like another 45

3900.0 --> 3903.4
minutes to go

3920.33 --> 3923.46
[Music]

3938.64 --> 3945.52
so do you know your laws and rights

3942.319 --> 3945.52
well not literally

3945.599 --> 3950.599
i have a pretty good feel for it

3961.52 --> 3964.4
all right p soon

3963.2 --> 3965.9199999999996
i hope

3964.4 --> 3968.2400000000002
i hope you're right

3965.92 --> 3971.2400000000002
i'm very suspicious you gotta realize

3968.24 --> 3971.24
that

3983.28 --> 3986.44
all right

4011.039 --> 4016.079
yeah no look

4013.52 --> 4019.68
it's very simple i'm never gonna get the

4016.079 --> 4022.6400000000003
jab no matter the circumstances

4019.68 --> 4023.44
i would rather resort to crime

4022.64 --> 4025.5989999999997
than

4023.44 --> 4027.92
be part of that

4025.599 --> 4031.119
although i'd like to avoid

4027.92 --> 4032.96
that partaking in crime

4031.119 --> 4034.799
you know

4032.96 --> 4037.92
pretty much at

4034.799 --> 4040.319
the maximum effort

4037.92 --> 4042.96
but it will never take a jab ever

4040.319 --> 4045.359
ever no matter the circumstances i'd

4042.96 --> 4048.559
rather kill somebody else

4045.359 --> 4051.2799999999997
than take a jab

4048.559 --> 4053.28
absolutely when it comes

4051.28 --> 4055.119
when it comes to that

4053.28 --> 4056.4
right but

4055.119 --> 4058.7200000000003
that's probably not going to be

4056.4 --> 4060.7200000000003
necessary but i do know

4058.72 --> 4063.5989999999997
how to

4060.72 --> 4065.4399999999996
avoid [ __ ] traps that are typically

4063.599 --> 4067.2000000000003
present

4065.44 --> 4069.039
corporately you know

4067.2 --> 4070.72
yeah through the corporate structures

4069.039 --> 4074.079
and all that

4070.72 --> 4076.64
so i'm not going to get fooled

4074.079 --> 4078.319
if i would ever go out and try to find a

4076.64 --> 4080.5589999999997
job again i'm not going to get fooled

4078.319 --> 4083.839
like that but

4080.559 --> 4085.92
yeah i wasn't planning on trying to find

4083.839 --> 4089.48
a job through the regular circuits

4085.92 --> 4089.48
anytime soon

4093.039 --> 4097.88
unless you

4094.319 --> 4097.88
know your rights

4107.199 --> 4114.0
well i know i roughly do know my rights

4110.0 --> 4114.0
chosen one i know what is relevant

4114.319 --> 4119.759
i'm just not a person that would

4117.04 --> 4122.56
literally memorize it

4119.759 --> 4123.92
i just roughly know it

4122.56 --> 4126.799
and

4123.92 --> 4128.96
details might slip my mind and then

4126.799 --> 4130.56
somebody else will click quickly fill

4128.96 --> 4132.4
that in for me

4130.56 --> 4135.92
and then my memory about it will be

4132.4 --> 4139.5599999999995
refreshing that's how it works

4135.92 --> 4139.56
that's how i work

4150.96 --> 4153.279
hmm

4155.359 --> 4157.679
right

4159.44 --> 4166.4
yeah and i'm not gonna be tested either

4161.92 --> 4169.839
no tests no mask no jab

4166.4 --> 4172.239
under any circumstances will i give into

4169.839 --> 4175.839
any of that ever

4172.239 --> 4175.839
for a job never

4182.319 --> 4186.400000000001
i mean i'll keep my social distance

4184.719 --> 4188.56
maybe right

4186.4 --> 4191.2789999999995
because that can potentially serve

4188.56 --> 4194.64
another function

4191.279 --> 4196.8
but everything else is just no way

4194.64 --> 4199.76
no way

4196.8 --> 4199.76
i just don't do it

4200.08 --> 4207.84
i'm not even gonna complain about it

4203.679 --> 4210.0
like out there i'm just not gonna do it

4207.84 --> 4211.679
right so i could be surrounded by

4210.0 --> 4213.28
hundreds and hundreds of people all

4211.679 --> 4214.96
wearing masks

4213.28 --> 4218.239
i'm not doing it

4214.96 --> 4218.2390000000005
and i'm just going to walk in

4218.719 --> 4223.84
and if they're going to ask me i'll show

4220.64 --> 4225.280000000001
them my exemption pass which is

4223.84 --> 4226.719
a base

4225.28 --> 4228.719
it's like derived from a government

4226.719 --> 4231.28
system that's official most people don't

4228.719 --> 4234.88
even know about that

4231.28 --> 4236.159
and as soon as i show it they'll usually

4234.88 --> 4238.96
have like

4236.159 --> 4241.5199999999995
a response almost comparable to oh he's

4238.96 --> 4244.96
a he's of the government or something

4241.52 --> 4247.280000000001
or he yeah he's an agent right they'll

4244.96 --> 4249.76
just immediately drop it that's been the

4247.28 --> 4252.4
response so far

4249.76 --> 4255.04
like even karen's regular carrots

4252.4 --> 4257.599999999999
haven't dared to be pushy

4255.04 --> 4259.44
with it against me

4257.6 --> 4261.6
now of course me

4259.44 --> 4264.4
looking the way i do

4261.6 --> 4265.84
right wearing all black

4264.4 --> 4267.5199999999995
with like black

4265.84 --> 4270.4800000000005
sturdy butts and

4267.52 --> 4273.280000000001
boots and my leather jacket and all that

4270.48 --> 4276.0
yeah

4273.28 --> 4276.0
that helps

4276.4 --> 4282.159
but i'm literally ignoring all these

4279.52 --> 4287.719
government pony trick rules i'm just not

4282.159 --> 4287.719
doing it i'm just not doing it

4301.76 --> 4306.4800000000005
you have to know you're right god

4303.84 --> 4309.360000000001
dude i know my god we haven't rights i

4306.48 --> 4311.5199999999995
know god's laws i know

4309.36 --> 4313.92
the spirit mechanics i know

4311.52 --> 4316.4800000000005
i know the laws i just i'm not about

4313.92 --> 4319.36
writing him down

4316.48 --> 4321.28
i know him in my spirit not cognitively

4319.36 --> 4323.839999999999
i know him in my spirit

4321.28 --> 4326.5599999999995
and when it's required my cognition will

4323.84 --> 4329.52
be able to flawlessly put down whatever

4326.56 --> 4331.76
is necessary

4329.52 --> 4331.76
yeah

4331.92 --> 4336.64
i'm not a memorization type of guy when

4334.4 --> 4338.0
it comes to that

4336.64 --> 4339.84
i do it all

4338.0 --> 4340.84
on intuition and

4339.84 --> 4345.52
spirit

4340.84 --> 4348.32
mechanics so could you use them in court

4345.52 --> 4350.8
well if i'm gonna go to court

4348.32 --> 4353.04
then i'd probably have to brush up with

4350.8 --> 4355.84
a lawyer wouldn't i

4353.04 --> 4358.88
i can't get those

4355.84 --> 4358.88
know how to get those

4359.04 --> 4363.36
and then i'll ask like what about this

4361.04 --> 4368.0
what about that i'll lay down my

4363.36 --> 4368.0
understanding and then they will relay

4368.56 --> 4374.360000000001
their insights and then we'll we'll

4370.88 --> 4374.36
figure it out

4419.12 --> 4422.12
right

4438.56 --> 4441.84
hey the kumu virus

4452.08 --> 4456.4
motionless center earth what

4460.159 --> 4462.879999999999
yeah that's how i'm going to pronounce

4461.28 --> 4464.4
you because i don't know how else to do

4462.88 --> 4465.89
it

4464.4 --> 4468.959
toeling

4465.89 --> 4468.959000000001
[Music]

4478.4 --> 4483.719
arrive in court as the king well i will

4480.719 --> 4483.719
certainly

4483.76 --> 4487.400000000001
arrive with honor

4500.719 --> 4506.4800000000005
no chosen one it's not fear of the jab

4503.84 --> 4507.679
that's holding me back it's i wanna do

4506.48 --> 4510.5599999999995
this

4507.679 --> 4512.159
i don't wanna be caught up in another

4510.56 --> 4515.52
pony trick

4512.159 --> 4518.96
routine system out there

4515.52 --> 4521.76
just so i can get by i want to do this

4518.96 --> 4525.04
and get by i'm good at this

4521.76 --> 4528.320000000001
people actually appreciate what i do

4525.04 --> 4530.159
and i'm interactive like i am highly

4528.32 --> 4532.88
interactive

4530.159 --> 4537.839999999999
and not and like very open in a sense

4532.88 --> 4540.32
that i am not personally rewroted by my

4537.84 --> 4543.1990000000005
compared to other people that are really

4540.32 --> 4545.28
talented and open

4543.199 --> 4547.839999999999
for interaction

4545.28 --> 4548.16
because there's more out there

4547.84 --> 4549.6
and

4548.16 --> 4552.639999999999
[Music]

4549.6 --> 4555.360000000001
i usually

4552.64 --> 4558.56
a lot more based than myself

4555.36 --> 4558.5599999999995
i am not that based

4561.04 --> 4565.28
compared to others i often feel like i'm

4563.28 --> 4567.44
a complete gamma now of course i don't

4565.28 --> 4569.679
have the the character traits that come

4567.44 --> 4571.919999999999
with that thank god

4569.679 --> 4574.0
so it's more delta but yeah i'm not

4571.92 --> 4576.2390000000005
really that based

4574.0 --> 4578.48
i am

4576.239 --> 4578.48
up

4578.84 --> 4584.719
there this this spirit this spirit is my

4582.719 --> 4586.719
domain kind of thing

4584.719 --> 4589.04
it's always been that it's always where

4586.719 --> 4589.04
i've been

4592.84 --> 4597.92
better i was never a star at earthly

4595.76 --> 4601.4400000000005
things

4597.92 --> 4601.4400000000005
except maybe for well

4604.239 --> 4610.0
certain types of interactions with the

4606.4 --> 4612.719
other sex but yeah

4610.0 --> 4615.52
no i've never really seen myself as

4612.719 --> 4616.88
being better than average

4615.52 --> 4619.280000000001
when it comes to

4616.88 --> 4621.76
dealing with the world out there

4619.28 --> 4624.32
when it comes to ideas and clarity and

4621.76 --> 4625.84
especially abilities like

4624.32 --> 4628.639999999999
being able to

4625.84 --> 4631.360000000001
keep a very focused rational mind even

4628.64 --> 4633.1990000000005
in times of extreme anxiety

4631.36 --> 4636.5199999999995
that's a unique skill

4633.199 --> 4636.5199999999995
that's rare

4637.84 --> 4641.6
most people

4639.12 --> 4644.48
that go through those types of things

4641.6 --> 4647.52
they completely lose it i don't and

4644.48 --> 4649.599999999999
that's been like a unique

4647.52 --> 4652.719
opportunity

4649.6 --> 4654.320000000001
right all these special abilities detail

4652.719 --> 4656.88
abilities i have

4654.32 --> 4659.28
work with doing this

4656.88 --> 4660.88
it works with doing this

4659.28 --> 4662.5599999999995
and the way i do it

4660.88 --> 4666.32
it does not

4662.56 --> 4668.64
work well if i go out on some typical

4666.32 --> 4668.639999999999
job

4672.8 --> 4677.159000000001
because everybody's all closed off

4678.08 --> 4681.76
usually are at work

4686.88 --> 4691.4400000000005
and i might potentially end up boring

4689.679 --> 4693.84
myself to death

4691.44 --> 4696.799999999999
because there is no flow

4693.84 --> 4696.8
i need the flow

4697.28 --> 4703.679
that's like i need doing this show i

4700.56 --> 4705.04
need to be part of flat earth debate

4703.679 --> 4706.4
because

4705.04 --> 4708.88
there's so much

4706.4 --> 4711.44
that happens in there that

4708.88 --> 4714.159000000001
is good for me that charges me in a

4711.44 --> 4717.5199999999995
positive way

4714.159 --> 4719.759999999999
that helps me clear up

4717.52 --> 4721.52
that i wouldn't get from regular jobs

4719.76 --> 4723.04
out there

4721.52 --> 4725.280000000001
right

4723.04 --> 4729.199
unless i'd had a

4725.28 --> 4731.04
like very well planned out career

4729.199 --> 4734.0
being a specialist at something and i

4731.04 --> 4736.8
don't really have that

4734.0 --> 4740.4
right if you just get regular jobs

4736.8 --> 4745.04
it really sucks guys it really sucks

4740.4 --> 4745.04
what sucks about it the freaking boredom

4747.12 --> 4751.5199999999995
like

4748.64 --> 4753.76
and that's even in the past when like 20

4751.52 --> 4755.040000000001
years ago around that time i tried to

4753.76 --> 4757.12
get jobs

4755.04 --> 4759.6
and did temp jobs and i would just get

4757.12 --> 4761.679
bored with it so quickly

4759.6 --> 4764.2390000000005
not like instantly but i would

4761.679 --> 4765.84
immediately expand beyond

4764.239 --> 4769.28
immediately

4765.84 --> 4770.4800000000005
beyond the the designated tasks for the

4769.28 --> 4772.639999999999
job

4770.48 --> 4773.599999999999
start fixing things and rearranging

4772.64 --> 4776.56
things

4773.6 --> 4779.1990000000005
like even doing social

4776.56 --> 4781.52
stabilization influences

4779.199 --> 4783.5199999999995
and then it would be done

4781.52 --> 4785.84
and then it feels like i have nothing to

4783.52 --> 4789.56
do here anymore this is a complete waste

4785.84 --> 4789.56
of my time and energy

4790.0 --> 4796.64
and it would become really a grind and

4792.08 --> 4796.64
depressing very like that would switch

4796.8 --> 4802.84
and then after i would literally fall

4799.12 --> 4808.5199999999995
asleep at work guys literally fall

4802.84 --> 4808.52
asleep because i was so [ __ ] bored

4820.56 --> 4825.6
spent four years studying for right well

4822.56 --> 4827.52
then yeah but lydia glad to hear right

4825.6 --> 4831.320000000001
it's a blessing to have a good job that

4827.52 --> 4831.320000000001
really works for you

4832.08 --> 4837.12
and it often does require

4834.8 --> 4839.52
being a specialist at something

4837.12 --> 4840.639
which is like typically what studies are

4839.52 --> 4842.96
for

4840.639 --> 4844.96
well i haven't done any

4842.96 --> 4847.679
completed study

4844.96 --> 4849.92
that'll allow me

4847.679 --> 4852.0
to basically continue in society with a

4849.92 --> 4854.4800000000005
profession like that

4852.0 --> 4857.199
i kind of haphazardly tried that with

4854.48 --> 4858.879999999999
goldsmithing then it turned out i'm not

4857.199 --> 4861.5199999999995
really

4858.88 --> 4864.56
like i am good at the craft

4861.52 --> 4864.56
i am not good

4865.76 --> 4870.96
business wise and going about otherwise

4869.04 --> 4873.5199999999995
to be a goldsmith

4870.96 --> 4876.4
because what they actually end up doing

4873.52 --> 4878.0
i do not like that everybody

4876.4 --> 4879.44
yeah

4878.0 --> 4882.08
everything i've seen out there it's like

4879.44 --> 4884.719
that's not what i want to do

4882.08 --> 4886.88
i i wanted the craft

4884.719 --> 4889.12
but like the profession and what comes

4886.88 --> 4891.04
with that i didn't like it

4889.12 --> 4893.36
at all

4891.04 --> 4895.04
most of it just becomes much more about

4893.36 --> 4896.08
sales or about

4895.04 --> 4898.639
bluff

4896.08 --> 4899.5199999999995
with the arts and all that right it's

4898.639 --> 4902.52
like

4899.52 --> 4902.52
no

4906.88 --> 4910.08
so yeah

4908.88 --> 4913.12
this

4910.08 --> 4915.6
what i'm doing here flat earth media

4913.12 --> 4917.36
kind of being eclectic

4915.6 --> 4918.320000000001
layman's teacher

4917.36 --> 4919.199
thing

4918.32 --> 4921.92
that's

4919.199 --> 4924.159
actually my specialization i literally

4921.92 --> 4926.96
created it out of nothing

4924.159 --> 4926.96
out of nothing

4927.199 --> 4932.08
i did not do any kind of study or course

4932.48 --> 4938.799999999999
before i started engaging i just did it

4937.12 --> 4941.12
i wanted to do it

4938.8 --> 4943.1990000000005
i was afraid to do it i was afraid of

4941.12 --> 4945.12
what i might become

4943.199 --> 4947.12
but i did it

4945.12 --> 4949.28
and that's where i'm at so this is

4947.12 --> 4953.36
literally my profession

4949.28 --> 4953.36
this is literally my job

4953.84 --> 4958.400000000001
i do have official payment through

4955.76 --> 4960.08
google don't that does not i don't get

4958.4 --> 4961.92
anything of that

4960.08 --> 4963.04
this is my job

4961.92 --> 4964.88
so

4963.04 --> 4967.679
every time somebody says oh what get a

4964.88 --> 4970.639
job get a job like no this is

4967.679 --> 4972.4800000000005
my job this is my profession

4970.639 --> 4973.76
i am an expert

4972.48 --> 4976.08
at this

4973.76 --> 4978.639
i am i am an expert

4976.08 --> 4981.199
i stream every freaking day

4978.639 --> 4983.76
every day even when i'm sick

4981.199 --> 4986.32
i end up streaming every day even when

4983.76 --> 4988.56
i'm not so inspired

4986.32 --> 4989.599999999999
i stream every day and i've been doing

4988.56 --> 4993.4400000000005
it

4989.6 --> 4993.4400000000005
for almost four years now

4995.76 --> 5003.360000000001
i'm an expert i'm a professional at this

5000.719 --> 5007.12
i'm a layman i might not have the the

5003.36 --> 5009.36
studies or the connections or

5007.12 --> 5012.4
or even like the organizational talents

5009.36 --> 5014.88
to really make it into a more media

5012.4 --> 5016.96
trained up or whatever

5014.88 --> 5019.84
i'm gonna mock it a little

5016.96 --> 5024.08
because i like to be raw i like to be me

5019.84 --> 5024.08
i'm myself professionally

5027.12 --> 5030.88
were you where were you last week

5028.96 --> 5033.28
streaming no my computer broke delta

5030.88 --> 5035.92
spirit that's where i was last week i

5033.28 --> 5038.719
was completely cut off from the internet

5035.92 --> 5040.56
shocked thinking that i might never get

5038.719 --> 5041.92
back online again because i didn't know

5040.56 --> 5044.719
if i was going to be able to get my

5041.92 --> 5044.719
computer fixed

5051.199 --> 5057.839999999999
right so i was off half a week because

5054.0 --> 5057.84
my computer was broken

5060.0 --> 5064.4
and it was

5061.36 --> 5067.44
extremely stressful as well i barely ate

5064.4 --> 5070.4
i had like diarrhea all the time

5067.44 --> 5072.638999999999
because i thought like this is the end

5070.4 --> 5074.5599999999995
like i'm gonna go broke i'm gonna go

5072.639 --> 5076.400000000001
depressed and i'm probably just gonna

5074.56 --> 5079.360000000001
die in my sleep that's how [ __ ]

5076.4 --> 5084.239
miserable i was

5079.36 --> 5087.5199999999995
but thankfully with some guidance and

5084.239 --> 5089.5199999999995
yeah the repairs having worked out

5087.52 --> 5092.320000000001
i got through it but yeah i'm kind of

5089.52 --> 5094.080000000001
broke right now so again i really need

5092.32 --> 5096.5599999999995
the financial support

5094.08 --> 5099.28
i really really do

5096.56 --> 5102.0
so if you can please support me on

5099.28 --> 5104.239
paypal even little bits like five euros

5102.0 --> 5106.96
or something it helps

5104.239 --> 5110.239
i mean i really kind of need more

5106.96 --> 5112.56
but i mean anybody in general that just

5110.239 --> 5115.04
has kind of a stable life

5112.56 --> 5116.96
and time to go about

5115.04 --> 5120.8
like even people that live on welfare

5116.96 --> 5120.8
can miss five euros sometimes

5120.88 --> 5124.96
i really need it

5122.4 --> 5128.32
it's what i need to keep going because

5124.96 --> 5131.28
if i run out of food i'm gonna

5128.32 --> 5133.599999999999
run out of energy to do my show as well

5131.28 --> 5135.679
i'm gonna be very distracted more and

5133.6 --> 5138.159000000001
more

5135.679 --> 5140.08
unless i'm able to get about financially

5138.159 --> 5142.4
and that requires your support through

5140.08 --> 5144.08
the paypal

5142.4 --> 5145.839999999999
on the short run

5144.08 --> 5148.08
anyway

5145.84 --> 5148.08
uh

5150.88 --> 5156.96
yeah but i am glad to be back though

5155.52 --> 5160.159000000001
and in a way

5156.96 --> 5163.44
maybe the half week break forced break

5160.159 --> 5166.0
was actually kind of good for me

5163.44 --> 5168.48
because it had been kind of like

5166.0 --> 5173.28
weighing on me too much

5168.48 --> 5175.28
that's why i was so sick every morning

5173.28 --> 5177.84
because it's just like

5175.28 --> 5179.5199999999995
i felt too much weight from it all i

5177.84 --> 5180.88
needed to take a break people were

5179.52 --> 5183.84
telling me you need to take a break

5180.88 --> 5185.76
nathan oakley was like publicly stating

5183.84 --> 5187.12
on this live show you need to take a

5185.76 --> 5188.719
break irwin

5187.12 --> 5192.0
and i was like no i can't stop i can't

5188.719 --> 5194.639
stop and i really couldn't

5192.0 --> 5197.28
and then destiny

5194.639 --> 5201.28
forced me to stop temporarily and that

5197.28 --> 5203.199
really did me some kind of good so yeah

5201.28 --> 5206.639
the only real downside was to the

5203.199 --> 5206.638999999999
financial backlash from it

5209.28 --> 5214.08
yeah and it was indeed surface day your

5211.44 --> 5216.4
white laptop saved my ass

5214.08 --> 5220.88
that thing is slow as [ __ ] when it comes

5216.4 --> 5220.879999999999
to graphics but it saved my ass

5223.52 --> 5230.0
that that's yeah i hadn't expected it

5225.84 --> 5230.0
would be so that it would work so well

5230.08 --> 5234.96
except for when you try to play any kind

5232.159 --> 5238.48
of like video games with graphics then

5234.96 --> 5243.719
it's like immediately screwed

5238.48 --> 5243.718999999999
but yeah service day yeah thanks so much

5262.32 --> 5266.159
seems like you're so fixated on the

5264.08 --> 5268.719
internet to provide everything for yeah

5266.159 --> 5268.719
that's right

5272.0 --> 5275.52
i used to have

5273.52 --> 5279.84
other things

5275.52 --> 5280.88
gti doesn't even mean anything to you

5279.84 --> 5284.88
was like a

5280.88 --> 5284.88
thing that turned into crypto

5284.96 --> 5288.0
but

5285.84 --> 5289.1990000000005
it's been completely

5288.0 --> 5291.52
broken

5289.199 --> 5293.5199999999995
what i engaged with originally because

5291.52 --> 5294.96
it did actually yield a bit of money

5293.52 --> 5296.88
here and there

5294.96 --> 5298.719
a few years ago

5296.88 --> 5300.96
but now it's

5298.719 --> 5303.44
like my dad and me are still trying to

5300.96 --> 5305.679
figure out how to get the thing

5303.44 --> 5308.799999999999
which is even like legal or legally

5305.679 --> 5311.28
registered and all that how to just get

5308.8 --> 5314.0
it to work again

5311.28 --> 5317.28
because like regular inquiry with the

5314.0 --> 5320.48
the help desk is just not even working

5317.28 --> 5323.199
right so i had an original plan

5320.48 --> 5324.48
a financial plan to get me through this

5323.199 --> 5325.919999999999
time

5324.48 --> 5328.48
it broke

5325.92 --> 5329.36
it broke a year ago

5328.48 --> 5331.28
like

5329.36 --> 5334.239
complete dysfunction

5331.28 --> 5339.44
doesn't do anything anymore yeah

5334.239 --> 5342.48
so now i am forced unfortunately to try

5339.44 --> 5345.839999999999
to compensate that with donations from

5342.48 --> 5348.799999999999
people that appreciate my activities

5345.84 --> 5350.56
and i also added realize i can't just

5348.8 --> 5353.12
ask for it and

5350.56 --> 5356.4800000000005
expect that to just arrive

5353.12 --> 5358.719
without me giving it my all

5356.48 --> 5362.5599999999995
in return

5358.719 --> 5365.84
so i'm basically doubling down on this

5362.56 --> 5365.84
on doing this

5379.92 --> 5384.719
avoid taxes too yeah that's right

5381.76 --> 5384.719
because it's a gift

5384.8 --> 5390.0
as soon as i engage in some kind of a

5386.8 --> 5391.679
contract i have to register it that's

5390.0 --> 5394.8
right that's why it has to be

5391.679 --> 5394.8
unconditional too

5397.199 --> 5405.32
yeah there's reasons

5399.28 --> 5405.32
why i do the things the way i do them

5409.12 --> 5413.36
don't you always give it your all

5411.6 --> 5415.6
yeah

5413.36 --> 5415.599999999999
well

5418.159 --> 5421.839999999999
it's a figure of speech

5422.239 --> 5426.959999999999
it basically stands for i realize that

5425.44 --> 5430.5599999999995
by

5426.96 --> 5432.32
having to go around like this i owe you

5430.56 --> 5434.4800000000005
all

5432.32 --> 5436.5599999999995
but i'm not going to be owed in a

5434.48 --> 5438.718999999999
contract

5436.56 --> 5440.2390000000005
it's going to be a karmic oh

5438.719 --> 5442.2390000000005
owing

5440.239 --> 5444.32
right

5442.239 --> 5445.28
because of the investment

5444.32 --> 5446.48
the

5445.28 --> 5448.96
the help

5446.48 --> 5451.199
the support

5448.96 --> 5453.44
i know there is expectations that i'm

5451.199 --> 5455.919999999999
gonna have to keep giving

5453.44 --> 5458.159
i'm gonna have to keep finding cool

5455.92 --> 5461.8
things and highlight

5458.159 --> 5461.799999999999
interesting things

5462.88 --> 5468.400000000001
even solve complex issues

5465.92 --> 5470.56
with my insight that's what i do and i

5468.4 --> 5473.839999999999
know it the more i

5470.56 --> 5476.2390000000005
yeah i get about based on your support

5473.84 --> 5478.96
the more that will be expected of me and

5476.239 --> 5478.959999999999
i i

5483.76 --> 5487.1990000000005
i intend to deliver

5488.719 --> 5491.84
with that right

5508.96 --> 5513.04
can you grow your own food by what

5514.56 --> 5518.639
no

5515.679 --> 5522.719
not chosen i'm not currently in a in

5518.639 --> 5522.719
this setup where i can grow my own food

5529.84 --> 5537.159000000001
it's not a crossbow akuma virus

5533.28 --> 5537.159
you stupid ass

5563.04 --> 5568.96
you know some surgeries can take two or

5564.88 --> 5568.96
three days yeah but what wilson

5569.36 --> 5574.5599999999995
they do actually take shifts though

5572.32 --> 5577.5199999999995
it's not one doctor that's gonna do

5574.56 --> 5580.320000000001
non-stop three-day surgery

5577.52 --> 5582.159000000001
or maybe in some very rare occasion when

5580.32 --> 5583.92
they're like the only one that can do it

5582.159 --> 5586.239
and then they'll be like drugged up and

5583.92 --> 5588.08
[ __ ] dangerous

5586.239 --> 5592.718999999999
most of the time with long-term

5588.08 --> 5596.239
surgeries they have different surgeons

5592.719 --> 5598.4800000000005
so like one works half the day

5596.239 --> 5601.28
then is completely exhausted then the

5598.48 --> 5604.4
other one takes over and the first one

5601.28 --> 5608.96
basically goes and takes some sleep

5604.4 --> 5611.599999999999
if they can or or a break at least right

5608.96 --> 5612.88
and by the way surgical masts

5611.6 --> 5615.280000000001
masks

5612.88 --> 5617.28
they do not wear them long

5615.28 --> 5620.08
this is only you put them on in surgery

5617.28 --> 5623.199
as soon as you kind of walk out

5620.08 --> 5625.36
you take them off again

5623.199 --> 5628.96
it's really only there to prevent

5625.36 --> 5630.639
spittle from getting in the wounds

5628.96 --> 5632.96
in in the open

5630.639 --> 5636.4800000000005
yeah during the surgery so

5632.96 --> 5636.4800000000005
that's really the only thing it does

5641.04 --> 5645.5199999999995
right that's why they wear the mask not

5643.44 --> 5648.08
because they're afraid of

5645.52 --> 5650.4800000000005
oh we're gonna get

5648.08 --> 5653.44
some kind of a virus or something no

5650.48 --> 5656.0
it's to prevent actual spittle

5653.44 --> 5659.599999999999
from the surgeon

5656.0 --> 5663.639
to fall into a wound

5659.6 --> 5663.639
that's why they have the masks

5686.639 --> 5689.639
right

5706.159 --> 5711.0
wear those masks for hours at a time

5719.84 --> 5724.32
yeah

5720.96 --> 5727.56
well nobody said being a surgeon

5724.32 --> 5727.5599999999995
is easy

5733.6 --> 5737.8
that's why they get the big box

5773.679 --> 5777.36
mask should be generally worn by the

5775.36 --> 5778.88
individual that is sickly

5777.36 --> 5781.28
well

5778.88 --> 5781.28
maybe

5781.76 --> 5786.08
but then again

5783.36 --> 5790.159
actually wearing a mask

5786.08 --> 5791.28
when you're sick is not very good either

5790.159 --> 5794.96
right

5791.28 --> 5796.96
i mean you could potentially say do it

5794.96 --> 5800.4
to kind of prevent direct

5796.96 --> 5803.28
spreading if that's even a possibility

5800.4 --> 5805.5199999999995
from the sick person to others

5803.28 --> 5806.88
but in general yeah when you're sick

5805.52 --> 5808.2390000000005
what do you need

5806.88 --> 5810.08
fresh air

5808.239 --> 5811.599999999999
what's the ultimate cure to pretty much

5810.08 --> 5813.679
every disease

5811.6 --> 5815.76
or is always going to be a good factor

5813.679 --> 5817.52
fresh air well guess what masks takes

5815.76 --> 5819.679
away right

5817.52 --> 5819.679
so

5822.08 --> 5827.239
in general masks are really never a good

5824.239 --> 5827.239
thing

5845.679 --> 5850.4
the masks recommend this stop spreading

5851.199 --> 5855.599999999999
yeah but they don't really do that

5854.0 --> 5856.88
though

5855.6 --> 5859.76
rocket man

5856.88 --> 5862.719
i know that's the suggestion they don't

5859.76 --> 5862.719
really do that

5864.32 --> 5869.84
right

5865.52 --> 5869.84
you don't actually stop the spreading

5870.719 --> 5875.199
that's the issue

5872.4 --> 5877.199
it's suggested to do that

5875.199 --> 5881.28
according to the model right

5877.199 --> 5884.08
but the comparison of a surgeon

5881.28 --> 5886.719
potentially dropping spittle which is

5884.08 --> 5890.239
liquid not just breath

5886.719 --> 5892.719
into a literal open wound like might be

5890.239 --> 5893.759999999999
like next to organs in very sensitive

5892.719 --> 5897.44
places

5893.76 --> 5899.84
is very different from being on the

5897.44 --> 5899.839999999999
street

5900.32 --> 5906.0
and then just like breathing or or even

5903.28 --> 5909.28
a bunch of spittle droplets going about

5906.0 --> 5910.719
i mean you don't really want that

5909.28 --> 5912.96
but

5910.719 --> 5914.719
that doesn't has doesn't carry the same

5912.96 --> 5916.96
level of risk

5914.719 --> 5919.76
and besides having people that are have

5916.96 --> 5921.84
a cold or whatever

5919.76 --> 5923.119000000001
in the same room as you

5921.84 --> 5924.4800000000005
doesn't

5923.119 --> 5926.639
necessarily

5924.48 --> 5929.5199999999995
give you a cold

5926.639 --> 5931.4400000000005
because it's not an infection process

5929.52 --> 5932.639
with that sort of thing

5931.44 --> 5935.678999999999
right

5932.639 --> 5937.679
like unless you literally have an open

5935.679 --> 5940.32
wound

5937.679 --> 5941.84
yeah yeah then i'd be like okay yeah

5940.32 --> 5944.08
maybe

5941.84 --> 5945.84
maybe cover that up

5944.08 --> 5948.08
you know

5945.84 --> 5948.08
but

5948.32 --> 5952.5599999999995
in general no

5950.239 --> 5955.36
it doesn't actually really

5952.56 --> 5958.080000000001
infect people

5955.36 --> 5960.48
it's also most of it is a psychosomatic

5958.08 --> 5960.48
trigger

5961.679 --> 5965.4400000000005
or maybe yeah it's so psychosomatically

5964.159 --> 5968.159
triggered

5965.44 --> 5970.159
accompanied by somebody having a real

5968.159 --> 5973.04
high toxic load

5970.159 --> 5974.5599999999995
that might potentially even shed

5973.04 --> 5976.48
a little

5974.56 --> 5978.84
to help the trigger

5976.48 --> 5983.759999999999
but it's not an actual

5978.84 --> 5983.76
infection from like an outside entity

5988.639 --> 5994.1990000000005
yeah that's right bob wilson

5990.88 --> 5994.1990000000005
that's right

5994.88 --> 6000.96
except for the general toxic load that

5998.08 --> 6004.88
would probably also come out of that

6000.96 --> 6006.4800000000005
i do i do not fear infection

6004.88 --> 6007.400000000001
what i would fear

6006.48 --> 6010.718999999999
is

6007.4 --> 6013.04
psychosomatically triggered association

6010.719 --> 6014.639
like if it smelled really

6013.04 --> 6016.8
gross

6014.639 --> 6019.28
for example

6016.8 --> 6021.84
or there's just something really

6019.28 --> 6024.88
like disgusting about the person when

6021.84 --> 6028.2390000000005
they're like that they get really near

6024.88 --> 6030.8
it might bring me back psychologically

6028.239 --> 6033.678999999999
triggered through psychosomatics

6030.8 --> 6035.679
to a time when i was that sick

6033.679 --> 6038.159
and that might trigger me then from

6035.679 --> 6040.08
becoming sick but as a law as long as i

6038.159 --> 6042.638999999999
can block that out

6040.08 --> 6046.36
and completely compartmentalize it i

6042.639 --> 6048.159000000001
will not get sick i guarantee it i

6046.36 --> 6052.4
guarantee it

6048.159 --> 6054.638999999999
i will not get sick

6052.4 --> 6058.0
because there is no infection

6054.639 --> 6058.0
like that doesn't work like that

6058.239 --> 6064.28
doesn't spread

6060.8 --> 6064.28
like an entity

6076.719 --> 6079.719
uh

6086.13 --> 6092.84
[Music]

6088.4 --> 6092.839999999999
yeah i already explained it bob wilson

6096.32 --> 6102.48
it's not an infectious

6099.28 --> 6105.759999999999
hostile invasive agent

6102.48 --> 6108.718999999999
that passes from one person to another

6105.76 --> 6110.719
like even viruses in general

6108.719 --> 6113.04
they're not living entities

6110.719 --> 6115.6
they don't procreate they're passive

6113.04 --> 6118.0
they don't move

6115.6 --> 6121.119000000001
even under a microscope they they're not

6118.0 --> 6123.76
they're like blocks of

6121.119 --> 6126.639
unliving matter

6123.76 --> 6126.639
they're not alive

6127.119 --> 6132.08
they are actually

6128.48 --> 6135.119
things that your body creates

6132.08 --> 6136.639
they're like

6135.119 --> 6138.88
uh

6136.639 --> 6141.1990000000005
they're like a broom

6138.88 --> 6143.679
right it's like there's brooms lying

6141.199 --> 6146.839999999999
around oh my god the brooms are invading

6143.679 --> 6150.4
us all this is like a weird animated

6146.84 --> 6152.8
broom which broom that's invading us and

6150.4 --> 6153.679
look at all these brooms everywhere or

6152.8 --> 6155.84
or

6153.679 --> 6157.92
the cleaners actually came around and

6155.84 --> 6159.6
they just dropped off a whole bunch of

6157.92 --> 6160.88
brooms because they're gonna sweep the

6159.6 --> 6164.159000000001
place and then they're gonna take the

6160.88 --> 6164.159000000001
broom back with them again

6167.679 --> 6171.119
the body makes it

6169.52 --> 6174.4800000000005
body makes

6171.119 --> 6177.119
these supposed viruses

6174.48 --> 6180.4
because it uses them it's a tool for the

6177.119 --> 6182.0
body to clean the place up

6180.4 --> 6185.599999999999
and that process

6182.0 --> 6187.44
engaging in that cleanup cycle

6185.6 --> 6189.280000000001
is something that can be

6187.44 --> 6190.919999999999
psychosomatically triggered through

6189.28 --> 6193.92
association

6190.92 --> 6196.08
psychologically specifically it starts

6193.92 --> 6198.0
with the psyche

6196.08 --> 6200.159
doesn't start

6198.0 --> 6200.159
with

6201.84 --> 6205.04
moist

6203.04 --> 6206.239
from a person that is in the sickness

6205.04 --> 6210.48
cycle

6206.239 --> 6210.48
touches you and you then get it

6212.4 --> 6215.839999999999
that doesn't automatically happen

6216.239 --> 6222.32
especially if you

6218.639 --> 6222.32
like don't even see them

6224.88 --> 6229.56
like if you don't even see that they're

6226.56 --> 6229.56
sick

6242.88 --> 6245.76
right i'm gonna take two minute break
