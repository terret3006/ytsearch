539.24 --> 543.6
into it was an older song like from 9

541.2 --> 545.0400000000001
years ago that I just for some reason

543.6 --> 548.6
missed out

545.04 --> 551.7199999999999
on or maybe it just hit the

548.6 --> 554.72
wrong hit the wrong frequency for me it

551.72 --> 558.12
was just perfect for me now considering

554.72 --> 561.12
the circumstance I just been

558.12 --> 561.12
through

562.16 --> 568.36
perfect this was really

564.8 --> 571.3599999999999

568.36 --> 571.36
it

572.64 --> 578.64
anyway for those who are

574.839 --> 580.7600000000001

578.64 --> 583.16
me through

580.76 --> 584.68
Skype they know what song I'm talking

583.16 --> 587.12
about because they're in the Flat Earth

584.68 --> 590.04
early bir chat and I share these kinds

587.12 --> 590.04
of things in

593.64 --> 600.959
there right also

596.72 --> 603.8000000000001
interesting flatter Sage

600.959 --> 607.8389999999999
like he made a comment that he had a

603.8 --> 609.0
link to a Declassified CIA document that

607.839 --> 611.519
mentioned

609.0 --> 613.8
tartaria and he did actually share that

611.519 --> 615.839
with me so that's that's actually real

613.8 --> 620.3199999999999
it's pretty

615.839 --> 620.32
interesting hello manang go good to see

623.44 --> 629.1600000000001
you could

626.24 --> 630.54
actually probably share that with you

629.16 --> 637.49
guys

630.54 --> 637.49
[Music]

645.079 --> 650.6389999999999
see

646.639 --> 652.9590000000001
yeah it's unfortunately it's like a scan

650.639 --> 656.16
so I can't highlight text specifically

652.959 --> 656.16
that's a bit

658.24 --> 661.24
annoying

664.2 --> 669.0
what yeah I could show it to you but you

666.68 --> 672.2399999999999
wouldn't be able to really read it

669.0 --> 674.21
unless I like really zoomed in on it I

672.24 --> 678.839
could do that

674.21 --> 678.839
[Music]

681.22 --> 687.44
[Music]

684.88 --> 691.24
yeah let me try that maybe you can see

687.44 --> 691.24
some of it

697.66 --> 704.36
[Music]

701.76 --> 707.4399999999999
uh here you

704.36 --> 709.5600000000001
go CIA

707.44 --> 712.6
document

709.56 --> 715.5999999999999
so this

712.6 --> 715.6
part

718.24 --> 724.25
basically

720.24 --> 731.24
scientific revision of the history of

724.25 --> 735.0
[Music]

731.24 --> 737.44
tartaria cuz there are tartar people

735.0 --> 741.72
there apparently and there's been

737.44 --> 741.72
giant revision about

744.279 --> 751.8389999999999
it so yeah there you go there's a

747.199 --> 751.8389999999999
reference to Taria very

752.639 --> 757.11
interesting don't know if you can read

754.639 --> 759.5600000000001
that might have to like zoom in or

757.11 --> 761.6800000000001
[Music]

759.56 --> 764.04
something but yeah that was an

761.68 --> 766.5999999999999
interesting little document I got from

764.04 --> 766.5999999999999
flatter

767.3 --> 770.3499999999999
[Music]

770.88 --> 775.11
Sage mic clipping yeah that's probably

774.36 --> 778.12
just

775.11 --> 781.12
[Music]

778.12 --> 781.12
you

[Music]

825.28 --> 833.199
[Music]

831.56 --> 836.68
clipping

833.199 --> 836.68
H okay that's

838.04 --> 841.04
weird

844.04 --> 847.0899999999999
[Music]

853.079 --> 856.079
it's not showing

859.88 --> 865.92
anything

862.6 --> 868.0400000000001
H maybe my mic is having a bit of an off

865.92 --> 871.04
day could

868.04 --> 871.04
be

880.0 --> 886.399
there's not like a lot of noise around

882.759 --> 886.399
so I wouldn't know why it would be

887.88 --> 893.07
[Music]

897.48 --> 901.639
clipping hey clutch could see

902.48 --> 908.399
you clicking every now and then as long

905.44 --> 911.399
as it doesn't like cut out of my

908.399 --> 913.72
speaking directly cuz that would be

911.399 --> 913.72
really

916.09 --> 919.139
[Music]

922.92 --> 927.8389999999999
annoying yeah hey some people are into

927.959 --> 930.959
that

935.36 --> 943.519
but I mean like I have very specific

939.199 --> 943.519
distinct music taste too so I'm

943.8 --> 949.04
like if it is

945.959 --> 951.6389999999999
even remotely mainstream there's a great

949.04 --> 956.02
likelihood I'm not going to like it

951.639 --> 957.92
unless it was like 30 years

956.02 --> 959.6
[Music]

957.92 --> 962.399
ago

959.6 --> 964.8000000000001
like Kate Bush and the police was about

962.399 --> 968.68
like yeah that was kind of mainstream

964.8 --> 971.24
and popular and I did really like that

968.68 --> 972.88
and that's about it and it's not even

971.24 --> 974.399
like oh I like it so much I actually

972.88 --> 978.8389999999999
want to listen it all the time

974.399 --> 979.839
absolutely not I did back then but now

978.839 --> 983.1600000000001
it's

979.839 --> 987.9200000000001
like pretty much anything after that

983.16 --> 990.319
just like no no it mostly

987.92 --> 993.36
sucks

990.319 --> 995.959
I have to dig up my music out of like

993.36 --> 998.24
Corners where nobody actually looks and

995.959 --> 998.2399999999999
all

1006.94 --> 1011.759
[Music]

1008.36 --> 1014.72

1022.72 --> 1028.48
electronic but

1025.919 --> 1030.439
great

1028.48 --> 1034.319
simple

1030.439 --> 1040.0790000000002
great harmonically like

1034.319 --> 1040.079
perfect not overdone and that's very

1043.71 --> 1046.819
[Music]

1268.32 --> 1275.9299999999998
5 video game because it has some really

1272.76 --> 1281.0
great classical music tracks in

1275.93 --> 1284.0800000000002
[Music]

1281.0 --> 1286.08
there all right the mood needs to be

1284.08 --> 1288.9189999999999
there yeah well classical music is

1286.08 --> 1293.32
especially fantastic when there's just

1288.919 --> 1297.96
lots of people being really agitated and

1293.32 --> 1300.08
like Rowdy [ __ ] like and whiny whiny

1297.96 --> 1303.279
whiny around you and then it's like oh

1300.08 --> 1305.32
just like walk out of the room and

1303.279 --> 1308.12
listen to some classical music it's

1305.32 --> 1308.12
excellent for

1309.6 --> 1314.039
that it gives you that feeling like

1311.96 --> 1317.32
while the peasants are squabbling

1314.039 --> 1319.84
amongst themselves you can just tune out

1317.32 --> 1324.1589999999999
and go to the higher

1319.84 --> 1324.1589999999999
regions I love that about classical

1325.48 --> 1330.64
music Pink Floyd yeah Pink Floyd's

1341.36 --> 1347.52
nice okay flat soid yeah

1345.24 --> 1350.52
sure I'm sure he

1347.52 --> 1350.52
does

1358.48 --> 1364.24
I wish him the best of luck I mean with

1360.24 --> 1367.08
everything that he's done I have grave

1364.24 --> 1369.36
doubts that people like witd and David

1367.08 --> 1371.8799999999999
Wise will want to actually associate

1369.36 --> 1371.8799999999999
with him at

1372.0 --> 1377.44
all I mean I've had some rage wi moments

1375.76 --> 1382.2
and I've had

1377.44 --> 1386.48
some bad social behavior sure but I

1382.2 --> 1386.48
mean I still have a

1391.64 --> 1399.0490000000002
level but uh I'm sure he can

1395.94 --> 1399.049
[Music]

1400.6 --> 1406.7199999999998
try Pink Floyd down thumb what is

1407.44 --> 1410.44
this

1414.88 --> 1420.159
you honestly can't understand anything

1416.799 --> 1422.4
flat so says yeah no [ __ ] that's what

1420.159 --> 1425.7600000000002
I've been saying for for a while now

1422.4 --> 1427.2
it's like yeah it's all really nice but

1425.76 --> 1429.64
it's just

1427.2 --> 1432.24
like if I could just understand what

1429.64 --> 1432.24
he's talking

1435.32 --> 1441.36
about and I genuinely feel that flat

1438.2 --> 1444.0800000000002
side even even gets sloppy with what he

1441.36 --> 1446.12
says because he's just counting on that

1444.08 --> 1448.72
people just won't really understand what

1446.12 --> 1448.7199999999998
he's saying

1449.559 --> 1455.799
anyway he doesn't correct himself he

1452.6 --> 1458.3999999999999
doesn't actually make effort to make

1455.799 --> 1458.4
himself

1467.36 --> 1470.36
comprehensible

1471.24 --> 1475.96
okay I don't know about that debatable D

1474.48 --> 1478.679
I'm not going to make any judgments

1475.96 --> 1478.679
about his

1497.32 --> 1500.32
panelists

1500.76 --> 1507.039
nuk yeah no I've never I kind of missed

1504.36 --> 1507.039
out on Pink

1508.52 --> 1514.76
Floyd but there's a lot of songs that

1512.44 --> 1517.2
are just very likable of

1514.76 --> 1520.0
[Music]

1517.2 --> 1521.8400000000001
them it's just that for some reason my

1520.0 --> 1524.799
parents were not really into him or

1521.84 --> 1527.32
something they were different types of

1524.799 --> 1530.32
music

1527.32 --> 1530.32
fans

1533.76 --> 1538.76
more Funk and

1539.0 --> 1542.799
Jazz oriented I

1554.44 --> 1558.6000000000001
think but it's even weird that I like

1556.919 --> 1561.88
missed out of them because I had a whole

1558.6 --> 1564.039
hippie phase in my teens where I would

1561.88 --> 1567.44
listen to The Beach Boys

1564.039 --> 1571.32
man it was really silly and retrospect

1567.44 --> 1574.6000000000001
but I I liked it I liked like how old it

1571.32 --> 1574.6
sounded in

1578.24 --> 1585.559
ways but yeah Pink Floyd just completely

1582.159 --> 1590.24
passed by it like it just passed me by

1585.559 --> 1590.24
like for decades weird

1592.96 --> 1598.919
yeah youber golf

1595.48 --> 1600.96
face your teens and 20s yeah with me the

1598.919 --> 1605.96
goth face kind

1600.96 --> 1608.0
of I just had weird sort of not really

1605.96 --> 1609.559
goth face where I would listen to corn

1608.0 --> 1613.32
and that kind of

1609.559 --> 1616.399
[ __ ] just more weird music and then like

1613.32 --> 1620.039
in my 20s I actually got into the

1616.399 --> 1624.6399999999999
goth much more

1620.039 --> 1629.72
and then black metal and everything and

1624.64 --> 1629.72
but yeah I'm not into that anymore at

1631.08 --> 1637.84
all Beach Boy Harmony is amazing yeah no

1634.039 --> 1641.399
it is and I appreciated

1637.84 --> 1643.399
that but I mean it is like I did really

1641.399 --> 1649.32
use it as stoner

1643.399 --> 1653.0
music like BR Beach Boys man

1649.32 --> 1655.36
well I was I was that kind of a hippie I

1653.0 --> 1655.36
really

1660.1 --> 1665.399
[Music]

1662.279 --> 1668.399
was corn yeah that was but that was just

1665.399 --> 1671.399
my teens dude it started with

1668.399 --> 1671.399
like

1671.44 --> 1677.6000000000001
Prodigy when I was

1674.32 --> 1682.279
13 and then kind of like other stuff

1677.6 --> 1682.279
that went alongside them including corn

1682.519 --> 1690.3990000000001
and and other stuff also electronic

1686.96 --> 1692.48
stuff like got into like goat trans

1690.399 --> 1694.279
alongside that it was kind of like a

1692.48 --> 1696.799
weird mix of

1694.279 --> 1699.24
chaos all that music gives me a freaking

1696.799 --> 1701.96
headache now except for the Prodigy well

1699.24 --> 1706.08
it also kind of be it's just too

1701.96 --> 1708.679
much and then it like I eventually

1706.08 --> 1710.1589999999999
started to realize like yeah

1708.679 --> 1714.159
it was when I was

1710.159 --> 1719.3600000000001
19 like yeah I am going to go into the

1714.159 --> 1719.3600000000001
goth scene but that was like way at the

1720.799 --> 1727.08
end and then I went for the whole

1723.799 --> 1730.279
Spectrum got Gothic rock as well

1727.08 --> 1731.9189999999999
and folk

1730.279 --> 1736.279
style

1731.919 --> 1740.0
and metal black metal

1736.279 --> 1742.799
and and then event found my way over to

1740.0 --> 1745.679
Electro wave

1742.799 --> 1747.519
style and then kind of eventually grew

1745.679 --> 1750.159
out of everything else and stuck to the

1747.519 --> 1753.159
electro wave style that's like my

1750.159 --> 1753.159
style

1758.12 --> 1763.12
like there was like more parties of that

1760.6 --> 1765.6399999999999
anyway look at going to concerts like

1763.12 --> 1767.039
especially black metal concerts it kind

1765.64 --> 1770.039
of

1767.039 --> 1770.039
sucked

1771.559 --> 1776.6399999999999
a lot of those people were just kind of

1776.76 --> 1780.64
deranged and sick

1785.32 --> 1789.6399999999999
sickly but it was very interesting to

1787.72 --> 1792.279
have experienced that

1789.64 --> 1793.2
though some creepy [ __ ] going around

1792.279 --> 1799.84
there

1793.2 --> 1802.96
too like just subconscious creepy [ __ ]

1799.84 --> 1805.559
but uh yeah that's all in the p in the

1802.96 --> 1805.559
past now

1809.0 --> 1816.24
anyway corn goth yeah debatable D no I

1812.64 --> 1816.24
was arguably a little bit

1819.12 --> 1826.9599999999998
emo during my teens but like then at the

1823.88 --> 1828.67
end of that I started to take goth more

1826.96 --> 1831.89
serious

1828.67 --> 1831.89
[Music]

1833.559 --> 1837.0
like started to make my own

1837.919 --> 1841.7990000000002
jewelry it's kind of weirdly enough

1840.36 --> 1844.76
that's kind of why I went into

1841.799 --> 1846.6399999999999
goldsmithing it's like I just want to

1844.76 --> 1849.1589999999999
wear my own

1846.64 --> 1854.3200000000002
jewelry I don't want to buy any more

1849.159 --> 1856.72
preap crap out there I want to make it

1854.32 --> 1856.72
and I

1856.919 --> 1859.919
did

1862.519 --> 1868.799
was cheaper way better quality and I

1865.279 --> 1868.799
could like really brag with

1872.05 --> 1878.509
[Music]

1885.12 --> 1890.9599999999998
it yeah now debatable D I am not about

1892.08 --> 1900.9189999999999

2518.16 --> 2522.72
so that's definitely not going to

2520.2 --> 2526.319
happen if anybody's going to whine about

2522.72 --> 2526.319
that I will ban them

2532.28 --> 2539.079
instantly it's not worth a lot it's only

2536.4 --> 2540.96
worth a lot to those who really want it

2539.079 --> 2546.04
and will are willing to give a lot of

2540.96 --> 2546.04
money for it guess what it's not for

2546.119 --> 2550.04
sale

2548.319 --> 2551.2799999999997
yeah if you really want me to make

2550.04 --> 2555.0
something for

2551.28 --> 2557.2400000000002
you then well arguably we could arrange

2555.0 --> 2559.52
that but I don't really have my workshop

2557.24 --> 2561.839
available to me at all so it's just not

2559.52 --> 2561.839
going to

2562.88 --> 2567.98
happen until my circumstances

2565.559 --> 2571.079

2567.98 --> 2576.119
[Music]

2571.079 --> 2579.8390000000004

2747.48 --> 2753.559
gotten some more income

2749.68 --> 2757.9199999999996
somehow then I could consider say

2753.559 --> 2759.44
getting another room right next to this

2757.92 --> 2761.52
room

2759.44 --> 2766.0
and use

2761.52 --> 2768.64
that well to put my storage stuff in and

2766.0 --> 2771.64
then perhaps turn it into a bit of a

2768.64 --> 2771.64

swiping bugs of my windshield because

3042.48 --> 3046.64
pointless like why would you need to

3044.559 --> 3048.2400000000002
curse them all you need to realize is

3046.64 --> 3051.0789999999997
that they are

3048.24 --> 3052.8799999999997
cursed and just not let that curse rub

3051.079 --> 3055.799
off on you because that's what they want

3052.88 --> 3058.559
they're desperately trying to make you

3055.799 --> 3062.0
open up your energy energy so that the

3058.559 --> 3064.52
curse can rub off on you and then they

3062.0 --> 3067.48
can have a little breather room yeah

3064.52 --> 3072.119
that's how that works it ain't working

3067.48 --> 3074.119
no more huh you can all rot in hell cuz

3072.119 --> 3076.48
that's exactly what where you are I

3074.119 --> 3078.48
don't need to do

3076.48 --> 3082.359
anything

3078.48 --> 3085.559
yeah all I need is to just laugh it up

3082.359 --> 3088.5589999999997
cuz I know what's happening with

3085.559 --> 3088.559
you

3092.76 --> 3099.079
Jesus a good what the

3096.599 --> 3104.76

3099.079 --> 3104.76
share that that is messed up dude

3106.2 --> 3114.2
or I don't know if you're a dude or a

3108.72 --> 3114.2
chick but either way it's pretty [ __ ]

3115.52 --> 3118.52
up

3125.319 --> 3129.4
yeah don't don't play around with that B

3135.64 --> 3140.8799999999997
Johnson that's good money I don't want

3138.4 --> 3141.96
to know really especially if you're a

3140.88 --> 3145.52
guy

3141.96 --> 3148.0
then that's a big

3145.52 --> 3151.68
mark

3148.0 --> 3151.68
I do not tolerate that sort of

3155.84 --> 3165.42
[Music]

3174.799 --> 3178.88
thing I really hope you're a

3181.76 --> 3188.079
chick cuz otherwise that's pretty [ __ ]

3190.4 --> 3199.119
up oh my God yeah yeah well then I

3194.64 --> 3199.1189999999997
really don't want to know about it

3199.2 --> 3205.3999999999996
thanks yeah yeah sharing that sort of

3202.44 --> 3207.64
thing even with the best intent leads to

3205.4 --> 3210.4
me not wanting to have anything to do

3207.64 --> 3210.4
with you ever

3210.48 --> 3217.52
again yeah so you better keep that kind

3213.88 --> 3221.119
of background to yourself because I will

3217.52 --> 3224.92
just excommunicate you yeah you need to

3221.119 --> 3224.92
keep that sort of thing to yourself

3233.92 --> 3238.64
forever if you bring it up one more time

3237.04 --> 3243.04
I will ban you

3238.64 --> 3243.04
unconditionally I don't care I don't

3245.72 --> 3255.3999999999996
care oh wait I might care

3250.92 --> 3255.4
okay right never

3259.72 --> 3265.2
mind all right all

3261.88 --> 3265.2000000000003
right fair

3265.359 --> 3268.359
enough

3269.72 --> 3274.24
I thought you were going in a certain

3271.48 --> 3275.64
direction where that's an absolute no no

3274.24 --> 3278.3999999999996
zone for

3275.64 --> 3280.8799999999997
me like that's a line that shall not be

3278.4 --> 3280.88
crossed

3281.559 --> 3287.0400000000004
ever so but that's fine I mean it's

3284.319 --> 3291.2
[ __ ] up what you've done but

3287.04 --> 3291.2
hey technically it's your

3293.559 --> 3298.3190000000004
life hey Richard G good to see you

3305.319 --> 3311.68
yeah but I mean again Ben Johnston like

3308.119 --> 3314.839
I curses are [ __ ]

3311.68 --> 3314.839
idiotic they

3314.96 --> 3321.119
are all you really need to do is realize

3318.079 --> 3325.0
that those you would curse are already

3321.119 --> 3329.28
cursed so the way you then go about is

3325.0 --> 3329.28
to disconnect yourself from that

3329.44 --> 3335.68
curse and just let it do its thing and

3333.2 --> 3338.24
you're completely out of

3335.68 --> 3341.24
it the difference is that when that

3338.24 --> 3345.16
situation passes you can go out of it

3341.24 --> 3347.3999999999996
and be completely free and they want and

3345.16 --> 3349.0
you wouldn't have had to do

3347.4 --> 3352.0
anything

3349.0 --> 3355.24
yeah that's

3352.0 --> 3357.59
winning cursing is per

3355.24 --> 3361.68
definition

3357.59 --> 3364.799
[Music]

3361.68 --> 3367.44
pointless only the cursed

3364.799 --> 3369.72
curse I'm talking about actual curses

3367.44 --> 3372.48
not swear words that's something else

3369.72 --> 3375.2
although that that goes in the same

3372.48 --> 3378.2
energy Direction

3375.2 --> 3378.2
eventually

3384.92 --> 3388.2400000000002
anyway good

3397.68 --> 3403.5589999999997
uh no debatable

3400.64 --> 3405.44

3559.24 --> 3562.799
things you can do with your attention

3561.839 --> 3565.0389999999998
better

3562.799 --> 3568.0389999999998
things way

3565.039 --> 3568.039
better

3569.079 --> 3573.48

3578.19 --> 3586.16
[Music]

3580.48 --> 3586.16
that i take words very

3588.45 --> 3593.72
[Music]

3590.76 --> 3598.039
serious favorite game

3593.72 --> 3598.0389999999998
whatever it's not funny

3599.079 --> 3604.039
and if it's from a video game or

3602.52 --> 3608.52
whatever

3604.039 --> 3612.079
then preface it don't just throw out

3608.52 --> 3616.0
something yeah I mean I would like

3612.079 --> 3618.48
reference certain spell words that I

3616.0 --> 3622.88
really appreciate from for example

3618.48 --> 3625.4
balers gate they had like in the games

3622.88 --> 3627.319
when you cast a spell in it certain

3625.4 --> 3630.839
things that were said but those things

3627.319 --> 3633.24
were like Latin words every spell

3630.839 --> 3637.0
casting was like a combination of three

3633.24 --> 3639.72
Latin words that actually

3637.0 --> 3641.599
referenced the the spell school which

3639.72 --> 3644.319
has something to do with like DND

3641.599 --> 3646.7200000000003
structuring of magic like the different

3644.319 --> 3648.72
spell schools and so you could even

3646.72 --> 3651.0389999999998
recognize what type of spell it was by

3648.72 --> 3654.16
the type of incantation that would be

3651.039 --> 3657.2400000000002
said verbally heard he you would hear

3654.16 --> 3660.839
that in the game

3657.24 --> 3663.24
right I I'll reference that and like I

3660.839 --> 3666.839
thought it was kind of cool but I'll

3663.24 --> 3669.3999999999996
preface it I'll just say like hey this

3666.839 --> 3671.44
is like something from a video game I

3669.4 --> 3672.48
think it's kind of cool I'm not just

3671.44 --> 3675.079
going to

3672.48 --> 3678.44
like here

3675.079 --> 3678.44

3693.599 --> 3700.44

you're interacting with me on the Flat

3733.76 --> 3739.6400000000003
Earth early bird show and you're capable

3737.64 --> 3742.5589999999997
of asking

3739.64 --> 3745.64
questions about

3742.559 --> 3749.3590000000004
subjects all that kind of thing you're

3745.64 --> 3752.0389999999998
not here because you really need to

3749.359 --> 3754.48
provide me with solid advice on how to

3752.039 --> 3757.48
live my life yeah because that's none of

3754.48 --> 3757.48
your [ __ ]

3757.799 --> 3761.319
business you

3763.599 --> 3769.48
understand saying ignore trolls is a bad

3766.4 --> 3769.48
thing it's none of your

3769.96 --> 3774.839
business it's none of your business

3772.2 --> 3776.48
whether I ignore the trolls or

3774.839 --> 3778.96
not

3776.48 --> 3780.88
yeah if you don't like it by all means

3778.96 --> 3783.839
tell me like oh I'm not liking all this

3780.88 --> 3786.799
troll stuff that's fine yeah you don't

3783.839 --> 3789.799
get to tell me what to

3786.799 --> 3789.799
do

3793.54 --> 3798.799
[Music]

3795.559 --> 3798.799
okay all

3801.799 --> 3806.68
right I know it's a Rowdy day today so

3804.76 --> 3810.119
everybody just gets carried away with

3806.68 --> 3810.1189999999997
that [ __ ] that's

3811.24 --> 3816.279
fine

3813.279 --> 3818.64
just building a fence here I'm just

3816.279 --> 3821.72
telling you this is how it works this is

3818.64 --> 3821.72
how it's dealt

3830.87 --> 3836.839
[Music]

3832.279 --> 3839.119
with yeah this is also a process of

3836.839 --> 3841.88
routing the weeds the weeds that are

3839.119 --> 3845.559
building up for a while and then it's

3841.88 --> 3847.6400000000003
weeding day where the trolls basically

3845.559 --> 3851.599
show their stinky Blossom show their

3847.64 --> 3851.5989999999997
real intent and then I have to Route

3851.799 --> 3856.16
them it's something that has to be

3859.96 --> 3866.039
done you can't just leave it there and

3862.48 --> 3868.72
ignore it it gets worse because then

3866.039 --> 3872.3190000000004
they'll start to expect that they can

3868.72 --> 3876.279
just do that yeah and do more of it and

3872.319 --> 3878.96
pull more people in with them that do

3876.279 --> 3881.359
that and that is

3878.96 --> 3886.039
unacceptable someday you just got to

3881.359 --> 3886.0389999999998
weed them out today is one of those

3891.6 --> 3898.799
[Music]

3892.839 --> 3898.799
days Yeah Yeah from Skyrim I remember

3904.119 --> 3908.6800000000003
that the like spell

3908.92 --> 3912.6800000000003
shouts that was pretty

3923.0 --> 3930.359
cool got to be careful so magic inations

3926.599 --> 3935.319
from games are built in Real World Magic

3930.359 --> 3935.319
a bit but I mean all magic is all about

3935.4 --> 3941.44
intention like the real magic doesn't

3938.68 --> 3941.44
require any

3945.319 --> 3952.44
words if you're strong enough it's just

3948.599 --> 3956.319
that if you start emulating

3952.44 --> 3958.96
stuff then yeah it's not good it's just

3956.319 --> 3963.72
don't dwell on this [ __ ] like don't be

3958.96 --> 3963.7200000000003
like a freaking teenager and dwell on it

3968.0 --> 3972.359
pointlessly Voodoo is not a

3972.88 --> 3981.44
spell spell spelling words words and

3977.319 --> 3981.44
their meanings and the intentions behind

3984.559 --> 3987.559
them

3999.359 --> 4006.4
is the technique magic it's

4002.72 --> 4006.3999999999996
magical but it's not

4009.599 --> 4013.76
spellcraft the words don't do

4014.279 --> 4019.2
anything it's more Spirit

4032.72 --> 4040.0789999999997
craft right the words that I use within

4036.64 --> 4042.5589999999997
it are merely a

4040.079 --> 4046.88
communication like that's literally what

4042.559 --> 4049.079
it is I'm communicating with my guides

4046.88 --> 4053.6800000000003
spirits that are assigned to every

4049.079 --> 4053.6800000000003
person on the other side you have

4054.4 --> 4062.52
to yeah deal with them it's it's

4059.96 --> 4065.039
complicated it's also simple but it's

4062.52 --> 4066.52
like complicated to for me for my mind

4065.039 --> 4070.079
to

4066.52 --> 4071.16
get a good grasp on it it's kind of

4070.079 --> 4075.6400000000003
weird to

4071.16 --> 4077.68
me but uh it works and the words don't

4075.64 --> 4081.23
do anything there's nothing like the the

4077.68 --> 4083.839
the actual sound effect

4081.23 --> 4086.76
[Music]

4083.839 --> 4089.799
does it's merely a communication you can

4086.76 --> 4091.7200000000003
literally do it silent you can do it

4089.799 --> 4095.799
without saying things it's just that if

4091.72 --> 4100.719
there's spoken words that emphasizes it

4095.799 --> 4100.719
more that makes the communication more

4104.12 --> 4109.599999999999
solid yes it has real words I'm

4107.56 --> 4114.04
communicating what do you mean speaking

4109.6 --> 4114.04
in tongues you even know what that

4125.6 --> 4132.6
means yeah

4128.839 --> 4137.2789999999995
guides the spirits that are assigned to

4132.6 --> 4141.0
you in your life everybody has

4137.279 --> 4144.359
them like everyone has

4141.0 --> 4147.12
them it's part of the spirit cosmology

4144.359 --> 4147.120000000001
it's just what it

4147.319 --> 4152.279
is they're

4149.44 --> 4155.08
the yeah they're arguably assigned to

4152.279 --> 4158.120000000001
you by God I mean that's part of the

4155.08 --> 4162.96
things that you also do in the afterlife

4158.12 --> 4162.96
the real afterlife after you don't come

4163.239 --> 4171.919999999999
back it's just how this Spirit realm

4168.199 --> 4173.44
works right you got angels and you got

4171.92 --> 4177.04
your

4173.44 --> 4180.639999999999
guides guides are more personal your You

4177.04 --> 4184.799

like I don't really have a visual on

4211.92 --> 4216.8

4214.36 --> 4218.08
communication they just know that what I

4216.8 --> 4222.2390000000005
do

4218.08 --> 4222.239
is important

4224.32 --> 4229.5199999999995

so the trolls are out and they're

5293.32 --> 5298.639
[ __ ] miserable they were yesterday

5295.56 --> 5298.639
dude they were all

5303.119 --> 5307.679
over

5304.92 --> 5311.52
what the [ __ ] are you whining

5307.679 --> 5311.52
about no Gerald

5312.92 --> 5318.0
them pretty sure they were talking about

5315.4 --> 5318.0
debatable

5323.84 --> 5329.76
D but even so I don't really give a

5333.04 --> 5336.04
[ __ ]

5339.719 --> 5343.199
y so you can go

5346.18 --> 5349.77

5362.76 --> 5368.52
like I gave a wrenching an

5366.0 --> 5370.679
impulse and I'm just I think I'm just

5368.52 --> 5373.8
not doing that anymore I'm just going to

5370.679 --> 5376.56
give nobody else ever a wrench unless

5373.8 --> 5379.4800000000005
you contact me on Skype and get on a

5376.56 --> 5379.4800000000005
video call with

[Music]

5389.52 --> 5397.040000000001
me right but man sometimes I just give

5393.6 --> 5400.76
out branches because I like it it's like

5397.04 --> 5403.0
I like to give out prizes right but I

5400.76 --> 5405.679
know when I give out prizes especially

5403.0 --> 5407.56
to new people that just show up that

5405.679 --> 5409.32
they're probably going to turn out to be

5407.56 --> 5410.92
a [ __ ] troll piece of [ __ ] that's

5409.32 --> 5415.0
undercover

5410.92 --> 5418.159
because they're miserable goblins that

5415.0 --> 5420.56
have no [ __ ] life like their life is

5418.159 --> 5423.44
to just try to make other people feel

5420.56 --> 5425.679
miserable that is that is all that their

5423.44 --> 5428.48
life is

5425.679 --> 5430.639
they don't really have much of a life so

5428.48 --> 5433.119
that's the length they will

5430.639 --> 5436.32
go

5433.119 --> 5438.599999999999
and it doesn't hurt me it doesn't scare

5436.32 --> 5442.92
me it doesn't even make me miserable

5438.6 --> 5445.679
it's just kind of baffles me like wow

5442.92 --> 5448.84
that's that's what you do

5445.679 --> 5451.8
huh it's kind of like bacteria like they

5448.84 --> 5454.159000000001
do a lot and they multiply and they feed

5451.8 --> 5455.92
of stuff but I mean it does have

5454.159 --> 5456.799999999999
function it does kind of eat away the

5455.92 --> 5460.0
dead

5456.8 --> 5461.56
flesh right bacteria have a function

5460.0 --> 5464.239
they're in your body they're hiding

5461.56 --> 5466.159000000001
there and if you have certain things

5464.239 --> 5468.48
they're going to get to work and so I

5466.159 --> 5472.0
kind of see the trolls like that they're

5468.48 --> 5474.919999999999
just testing testing if there's any kind

5472.0 --> 5477.48
of thing that they can unravel about me

5474.92 --> 5480.96
some kind of energy spark that they

5477.48 --> 5483.678999999999
can make me unleash some kind of

5480.96 --> 5487.56
weakness that they can touch upon and

5483.679 --> 5488.639
that's fine I mean yeah they they did in

5487.56 --> 5491.0
the

5488.639 --> 5494.04
past

5491.0 --> 5496.679
but it's pretty much cleaned

5494.04 --> 5498.92
out there's no more dead flesh here to

5496.679 --> 5498.92
be

5499.679 --> 5503.679
gotten so yeah bacterial blooms they can

5502.639 --> 5508.4800000000005
come and

5503.679 --> 5508.4800000000005
go but it's not doing anything to

5508.56 --> 5513.639
me it's like

5510.8 --> 5514.56
yeah it's been like this for 2 years I

5513.639 --> 5518.1990000000005
know

5514.56 --> 5521.119000000001
like yeah I don't care I just I'm still

5518.199 --> 5524.119
going to do my show guys I'm still going

5521.119 --> 5528.32
to do my show and I'm going to have fun

5524.119 --> 5530.96
doing it there's nothing you can do

5528.32 --> 5534.679
nothing nothing at

5530.96 --> 5536.32
all doesn't matter what you try I'm

5534.679 --> 5538.4800000000005
going to keep doing my show and I'm

5536.32 --> 5540.719
going to have fun doing it and I'm going

5538.48 --> 5544.759999999999
to discover new interesting things that

5540.719 --> 5546.44
I'm going to discuss doing my show

5544.76 --> 5550.04
it's going to be

5546.44 --> 5552.678999999999
great I mean look at the the freaking

5550.04 --> 5555.44
winter just pretty much ended we're in

5552.679 --> 5557.92
springtime it's great yeah there's some

5555.44 --> 5559.96
bacterial Bloom there's a lot of people

5557.92 --> 5562.36
getting sick around me especially those

5559.96 --> 5564.76
that have participated in metal medical

5562.36 --> 5567.08
experimentations yeah now now that's the

5564.76 --> 5568.8
price that's the price every year you're

5567.08 --> 5572.36
going to get now

5568.8 --> 5575.4400000000005
permanently right be happy you're still

5572.36 --> 5578.639
there I don't have have that price I

5575.44 --> 5581.5599999999995
don't even have the sickness that much I

5578.639 --> 5582.4400000000005
got some minor issues like I'm noticing

5581.56 --> 5587.4800000000005
like

5582.44 --> 5589.119
H sugar has a bigger response so it's

5587.48 --> 5592.04
like candid at

5589.119 --> 5594.159
time to be careful not to like Chu down

5592.04 --> 5596.56
a whole bunch of sugar because it's more

5594.159 --> 5598.879999999999
addictive and there's more of a

5596.56 --> 5600.719
bacterial response too it so I got to

5598.88 --> 5602.8
like take that into account keep that in

5600.719 --> 5605.08
mind like don't get carried away with

5602.8 --> 5608.719
any anything sugar

5605.08 --> 5610.679
related right and that's me and that

5608.719 --> 5614.199
that's like that's my that's the extent

5610.679 --> 5618.2390000000005
of my spring time challenge I mean like

5614.199 --> 5621.44
I'm doing great I'm

5618.239 --> 5626.5599999999995
healthy I'm

5621.44 --> 5626.5599999999995
young I feel younger than I did 10 years

5632.719 --> 5635.719
ago

5637.6 --> 5640.6
okay

5649.6 --> 5655.4400000000005
right okay that's

5652.52 --> 5659.92
weird apparently the available D is not

5655.44 --> 5662.36
Moxy and I misread it it was Ben

5659.92 --> 5665.719
Johnson that was

5662.36 --> 5665.719
Moxy okay

5666.6 --> 5669.88
well that's that then I

5669.92 --> 5672.92
guess

5673.6 --> 5678.52
fine I don't know why he wouldn't say

5676.08 --> 5682.639
then I'm not Moxy

5678.52 --> 5682.639
but if he would have said that

5682.96 --> 5689.4800000000005
then right whatever I guess Moxy is

5687.4 --> 5692.5199999999995
still a complete [ __ ] scumbag piece

5689.48 --> 5692.5199999999995
of [ __ ] that has no

5692.639 --> 5695.639
life

5697.76 --> 5703.08
so in chat it was Deb now debatable D

5701.08 --> 5704.88
has been in the chat for a while and I

5703.08 --> 5707.84
thought that he was Moxy that they

5704.88 --> 5710.76
called him out about that but apparently

5707.84 --> 5712.4400000000005
it was all about yeah Ben Johnson's

5710.76 --> 5716.360000000001
who's no longer with

5712.44 --> 5718.96
us with this fake stupid

5716.36 --> 5721.719
bear he didn't really act like a bear

5718.96 --> 5724.32
that way anyway so I'm sure he's gonna

5721.719 --> 5728.159
pop up with his new stupid sock going

5724.32 --> 5729.92
around cuz everybody that I banned here

5728.159 --> 5731.679
that was supposedly undercover that I

5729.92 --> 5733.639
discovered they all pop up everywhere

5731.679 --> 5736.56
and just like oh I'm going to try to get

5733.639 --> 5738.6
in your face oh it's so intimidating so

5736.56 --> 5742.04
intimidating with your [ __ ] [ __ ]

5738.6 --> 5743.76
suck troll like literally nobody cares

5742.04 --> 5746.36
it's just

5743.76 --> 5748.4800000000005
like everybody else just sees that like

5746.36 --> 5751.119
wow these are some really weird deranged

5748.48 --> 5755.638999999999
people that just really want the

5751.119 --> 5755.639
attention of this one guy in chat

5756.52 --> 5760.88
but I mean every time that happens it's

5758.08 --> 5763.92
just like oh okay

5760.88 --> 5766.04
well I'll just go do something else then

5763.92 --> 5769.1990000000005
and not really pay that much attention

5766.04 --> 5773.119
to the chat or I'll out chatter it like

5769.199 --> 5774.759999999999
I did two days ago when I start talking

5773.119 --> 5777.08
about the Jesuits and how they altered

5774.76 --> 5778.639
history and oh everybody got really oh

5777.08 --> 5782.5599999999995
the trolls got really triggered oh they

5778.639 --> 5786.719
have to remind me of baly win and all

5782.56 --> 5789.4400000000005
that like I don't care I just made it a

5786.719 --> 5791.639
subject and it just went straight

5789.44 --> 5795.159
through

5791.639 --> 5797.84
it that's what I'll keep doing cuz

5795.159 --> 5800.119
they're just bacterial Bloom they're

5797.84 --> 5802.8
just a pointless side effect that's just

5800.119 --> 5805.36
trying to disrupt me and I'm not going

5802.8 --> 5805.360000000001
to let it

5807.47 --> 5811.88
[Music]

5809.44 --> 5815.5199999999995
work that was a good

5811.88 --> 5815.52
conversation right

5815.719 --> 5818.88
no yesterday was a great

5821.119 --> 5825.5599999999995
show was really interesting and I'll

5823.48 --> 5829.159
revisit that subject definitely

5825.56 --> 5829.159000000001
especially if there's more leads to

5833.56 --> 5840.639
it right but apparently debatable D is

5837.239 --> 5840.638999999999
not Moxy so that's

5842.52 --> 5845.52
cool

5867.4 --> 5870.199
right anyway I'm going to take a bite of

5868.88 --> 5872.119
my Illuminati

5870.199 --> 5875.44
CW

5872.119 --> 5875.44
cheers h

5902.44 --> 5905.44
for

5907.199 --> 5910.04
called a witard

5911.28 --> 5914.28
stream

5922.49 --> 5929.139999999999
[Music]

5925.44 --> 5932.44
H was also on Jesuits oh

5929.14 --> 5934.1990000000005
[Music]

5932.44 --> 5937.32
interesting

5934.199 --> 5940.08
I mean this subject this subject has

5937.32 --> 5942.599
been generally out there for a

5940.08 --> 5945.199
while there's a lot

5942.599 --> 5947.96
of conspiracy streams that have been

5945.199 --> 5950.5199999999995
done by

5947.96 --> 5953.36
Jesuits in general I don't really care

5950.52 --> 5953.360000000001
too much for

5954.0 --> 5959.4
that it's just kind of fear

5956.88 --> 5960.84
porish I'm much more interested in like

5959.4 --> 5965.04
what they actually

5960.84 --> 5968.28
do in the information War you could say

5965.04 --> 5972.719
how they erase history and rewrite

5968.28 --> 5972.719
it I always found that much more

5977.93 --> 5981.089
[Music]

5992.32 --> 5995.32
interesting

6052.239 --> 6055.239
a

6065.52 --> 6069.719
wrong

6066.4 --> 6069.719
duper that's

6070.56 --> 6076.679
incorrect I don't get mad for people

6073.96 --> 6076.679
revealing

6081.8 --> 6087.04
themselves I know he just did it to try

6084.48 --> 6089.119
to disrupt my show that's all they do

6087.04 --> 6091.679
that's all they try to do I have a good

6089.119 --> 6094.44
subject I'm rolling with it and then

6091.679 --> 6098.0
they try to disrupt it that's what they

6094.44 --> 6100.48
do like that's their priority they just

6098.0 --> 6103.88
don't want me to have a good show that

6100.48 --> 6106.36
has a point whenever I do that's when I

6103.88 --> 6107.96
desperately try to get in the way and

6106.36 --> 6110.96
that's where all the [ __ ] troll

6107.96 --> 6113.56
scumbags all suddenly try to reveal

6110.96 --> 6116.32
themselves cuz that's the reason they

6113.56 --> 6116.320000000001
effectively do

6122.679 --> 6127.04
it right duper

6142.159 --> 6147.119
so maybe it's both no I don't think

6147.52 --> 6151.96
so but maybe it's

6154.719 --> 6161.199
whatever one thing is for sure he's

6157.239 --> 6161.199
never isn't he's never going to get a

6172.119 --> 6175.119
wrench

6189.5 --> 6197.67
