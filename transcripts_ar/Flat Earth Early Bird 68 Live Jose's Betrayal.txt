3.589 --> 11.610000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.56 --> 15.66
early-bird number 68

11.61 --> 18.358999999999998
I'm your host Arwen and yet no guests

15.66 --> 21.0
starting out today yesterday wasn't

18.359 --> 24.51
blast with Constance Wow

21.0 --> 28.05
I still haven't haven't even watched it

24.51 --> 34.620000000000005
back but I had a very busy evening

28.05 --> 38.27
that evening went to a meeting it's very

34.62 --> 38.269999999999996
exhilarating kept me up all night

38.42 --> 45.2
so yeah weather is dry but cloudy

46.34 --> 60.230000000000004
not too bad so Susan chat hmm see Nick

54.579 --> 68.03
Voynich Steve secret Asian man then

60.23 --> 70.85
you'll feel hello guys yeah very curious

68.03 --> 75.32000000000001
as to what you guys think of yesterday's

70.85 --> 79.85
hangout went pretty pretty deep into the

75.32 --> 85.369
spiritual and constants really brings

79.85 --> 89.149
out the all that energy inside of me

85.369 --> 90.86
really brings it out it's very inspiring

89.149 --> 94.46000000000001
in that sense and she has she

90.86 --> 98.5
understands so much I feel very

94.46 --> 98.5
understood by herself

107.24 --> 114.25
well I'm sorry lumps in chat

114.54 --> 125.4
all right Riley needs 50k for that court

118.8 --> 128.01
case hmm okay well it's not gonna be

125.4 --> 132.9
very quick but I think that probably be

128.01 --> 135.44
able to get that together a little over

132.9 --> 135.44
McCool

147.2 --> 153.76
yeah

149.23 --> 158.17
my life seems to be in a speeding up in

153.76 --> 161.67999999999998
its pace for my experience and very

158.17 --> 166.05999999999997
excited about it also nervous I'm not

161.68 --> 169.12
used to this I'm used to taking it slow

166.06 --> 172.69
but yeah it's just the time is here now

169.12 --> 176.89000000000001
I'm I am speeding up and I'm not gonna

172.69 --> 181.32999999999998
stop because I need to go here I I've

176.89 --> 184.92999999999998
been in in this position long enough I

181.33 --> 187.989
need to get out and I am getting out and

184.93 --> 194.23000000000002
there are damn there are definitely

187.989 --> 199.33
places to go and I aim to go high I'm

194.23 --> 201.36999999999998
not letting my past sloth convince me

199.33 --> 204.209
that I can't make those goals

201.37 --> 206.23000000000002
considering how the world has changed

204.209 --> 211.019
considering the things that I now

206.23 --> 213.04
discovered and and working on so yeah

211.019 --> 214.959
there's of course the flat earth

213.04 --> 220.57
movement right over here and the

214.959 --> 223.45
hangouts and I will do this for as long

220.57 --> 227.68
as I can but it's not the only thing

223.45 --> 231.94
that's playing out because there is the

227.68 --> 234.54000000000002
company of which my father is a part

231.94 --> 237.88
that I've become part of and yet the the

234.54 --> 241.42
meeting yesterday was a part basically a

237.88 --> 245.019
training for that and it has to do a lot

241.42 --> 251.17999999999998
with presentation and conveying a

245.019 --> 255.14000000000001
message and also yeah being

251.18 --> 258.729
using sales tactics but in a in a good

255.14 --> 260.239
way not in a in a typical corporate

258.729 --> 264.68
aggressive way

260.239 --> 267.40999999999997
it's very morally sound I like you know

264.68 --> 271.009
you guys know how sensitive I am to

267.41 --> 274.13000000000005
those kind of things and yeah it's and I

271.009 --> 277.46000000000004
listen to every detail almost as if it

274.13 --> 282.62
were like a flattered debate and it's

277.46 --> 285.69899999999996
just like yeah this it's perfectly sound

282.62 --> 290.0
there's just a few minor details that

285.699 --> 292.55
are still part of the lower conception

290.0 --> 297.199
of good that are part of it as part of

292.55 --> 299.36
the sales strategy that it's very

297.199 --> 301.22
typical story of this age is the counter

299.36 --> 304.46000000000004
response against the deep state effects

301.22 --> 308.99
against the aromanian army as it were

304.46 --> 311.06
that are trying to choke everyone it's a

308.99 --> 316.15000000000003
counter response and that's natural but

311.06 --> 319.58
I personally would like to while

316.15 --> 322.25
humanity struggles free struggles free

319.58 --> 325.34
mentaly struggles free financially and

322.25 --> 329.32
that is a big part of this company what

325.34 --> 332.03
their mission is they should be

329.32 --> 334.729
competing with the banker monopoly over

332.03 --> 337.789
the world it's pretty heavy stuff and

334.729 --> 340.599
they have a lot of you dish 'el they're

337.789 --> 345.65
getting massive you judicial flak

340.599 --> 348.409
there's an army of lawyers that are make

345.65 --> 351.919
trying to make a circle a circus out of

348.409 --> 354.5
the financial regulations that they have

351.919 --> 359.57
to deal with and it is quite fascinating

354.5 --> 362.36
they are fighting a similar fight as

359.57 --> 364.05
flat earth is against the globe but in a

362.36 --> 367.319
financial

364.05 --> 369.27000000000004
lair it's fascinating it's absolutely

367.319 --> 372.509
fascinating because it feels so much the

369.27 --> 375.50899999999996
same and I belong there as well and look

372.509 --> 378.99
what they do the presentation the sales

375.509 --> 381.21000000000004
tactics that could be convincing having

378.99 --> 383.909
a mission being morally sound being very

381.21 --> 387.0
sharp to other people's response because

383.909 --> 392.49
one important thing is that they say

387.0 --> 395.43
okay if you recruit if you get other

392.49 --> 398.55
people to join they have to be morally

395.43 --> 400.65000000000003
sound it's and that is awesome that is

398.55 --> 405.24
super awesome that a company would not

400.65 --> 410.099
just say yeah anyone is good but have to

405.24 --> 413.37
be moral people that if they grow

410.099 --> 416.96
wealthy thanks to the help of that

413.37 --> 420.09000000000003
company that they're not gonna be just

416.96 --> 422.0
starting raking I want more I want the

420.09 --> 426.539
whole world and just starting to become

422.0 --> 429.449
another corrupt top financially speaking

426.539 --> 434.11
it's very important to the people who

429.449 --> 438.13
founded this company it's called GTI

434.11 --> 443.86
mean anything but sentimental name for

438.13 --> 446.23
the owner and yeah judicially I can't

443.86 --> 448.51
even talk too much about it very little

446.23 --> 451.87
actually in public they say no don't

448.51 --> 456.7
don't don't talk about it at all but I

451.87 --> 458.89
can drop a name at least and that's it

456.7 --> 462.55
I've talked to some people about it over

458.89 --> 465.15999999999997
here behind the scenes as well and yeah

462.55 --> 468.67
flat-earthers a lot of people here

465.16 --> 469.96000000000004
super super skeptical so it's gonna take

468.67 --> 472.96000000000004
some time and I'm gonna have to

469.96 --> 476.56
demonstrate it through my own life that

472.96 --> 479.65
it's actually real not another financial

476.56 --> 483.39
scam as everyone of course assumes right

479.65 --> 486.46
away whether yeah it's so complicated

483.39 --> 489.58
what's actually going on and I trust it

486.46 --> 495.19
and my dad trusted and went full in so

489.58 --> 497.90999999999997
yeah if I think it will go right I even

495.19 --> 500.89
threw my visions there was no sign of

497.91 --> 502.96000000000004
corruption virtually it's like there's

500.89 --> 505.63
still a lot of fighting though them but

502.96 --> 509.02
they stay strong to stay pure and this

505.63 --> 513.15
is I need to be part of this for my own

509.02 --> 516.8199999999999
reasons for my long-term goals and

513.15 --> 520.72
depending on how flat earth will unfold

516.82 --> 525.73
in the years I might also be able to use

520.72 --> 528.73
it to progress that it may even enable

525.73 --> 532.77
me on the long run depending on how wise

528.73 --> 537.27
the choices I make with my growth I

532.77 --> 539.65
might be able to even fund a serious

537.27 --> 542.47
exploration expedition it's one of the

539.65 --> 544.3299999999999
things and to be fair

542.47 --> 549.4300000000001
this before this is not my top priority

544.33 --> 551.94
I think that the restoring nature is a

549.43 --> 557.6099999999999
much more they're much more urgent

551.94 --> 561.25
priority than even that kind of thing

557.61 --> 563.65
because it is in my opinion very much

561.25 --> 566.41
under pressure in danger especially if

563.65 --> 568.18
human liberate sit self and we will

566.41 --> 571.24
naturally want to start to grow again

568.18 --> 573.79
that nature is going to risk being

571.24 --> 577.63
sacrificed in the process and I want to

573.79 --> 580.5699999999999
enable it to sit through the that

577.63 --> 583.18
transition as well and potentially fries

580.57 --> 586.7700000000001
in the new period so well so many people

583.18 --> 589.2399999999999
are mainly focusing on Oh humanity yes

586.77 --> 592.15
we need to release ourselves from the

589.24 --> 595.0
darkness and become according to the

592.15 --> 598.18
path of Christ do it right in their own

595.0 --> 600.88
each in their own interpretation and I

598.18 --> 602.41
think yeah that's excellent but I don't

600.88 --> 605.2
need to throw everything in that

602.41 --> 608.38
specific message I also see nature I

605.2 --> 611.38
also see the dangers and I want to make

608.38 --> 614.89
sure that it will be a durable

611.38 --> 618.88
transition and not one that will leave

614.89 --> 623.14
us with with less despite our freedom

618.88 --> 624.95
that's we don't need to in my view in my

623.14 --> 629.09
vision so many things

624.95 --> 633.74
we can do to prevent such such

629.09 --> 638.6600000000001
cataclysms because of our transitions

633.74 --> 641.75
because of revolutions anyway yeah big

638.66 --> 643.85
things I mean I mean to that you guys

641.75 --> 645.97
know it and I'm taking this very

643.85 --> 645.97
seriously

649.21 --> 658.39
so that's going on hello I'm right here

653.11 --> 662.92
hey Jose well so far we good morning

658.39 --> 666.54
yeah good morning oh by the way I

662.92 --> 670.4799999999999
figured out a little trick for my volume

666.54 --> 673.12
that's funny because if I in the control

670.48 --> 677.5600000000001
room in the back panel open up my volume

673.12 --> 678.94
to a max then apparently people in the

677.56 --> 681.0999999999999
Hangout will hear it

678.94 --> 683.59
perfectly fine without upping the noise

681.1 --> 690.52
level so that was nice

683.59 --> 694.12
take it that up good good so what is

690.52 --> 696.01
Flat Earth gonna take us in the next few

694.12 --> 699.28
years I'm asking that question myself

696.01 --> 703.47
you know I've been struggling more than

699.28 --> 708.43
ever since yesterday for some reason I

703.47 --> 712.09
was thinking on doing a little live live

708.43 --> 715.3599999999999
an event later myself just rambling

712.09 --> 719.08
about where I am today versus where I

715.36 --> 723.46
was yesterday morning because I got this

719.08 --> 725.44
little little persons in my shoulders

723.46 --> 728.08
one is telling me it's flat the other is

725.44 --> 730.8100000000001
telling me you're full of [ __ ] so I

728.08 --> 734.5
don't know something has to click in the

730.81 --> 736.78
last maybe 12 hours that I don't even

734.5 --> 739.93
know what I'm doing here like talking

736.78 --> 743.85
for you what is going on talk to me

739.93 --> 743.8499999999999
Flat Earth really

747.45 --> 752.86
hold on sorry I'm distracted very

750.279 --> 754.81
impolite of me I always do this [ __ ]

752.86 --> 757.6
getting distracted right when somebody's

754.81 --> 760.6899999999999
talking with I will get back to you said

757.6 --> 768.58
Karen B in Skype says I'm having it

760.69 --> 771.49
control I don't know so people in chat

768.58 --> 773.74
forgive me people in my in Skype

771.49 --> 776.05
everybody everybody in the flutter that

773.74 --> 779.5600000000001
knows mittens follows me forgive me

776.05 --> 783.13
board this is very disturbing for myself

779.56 --> 785.7399999999999
but what is what is this flattered thing

783.13 --> 788.14
this is a belief system that we have

785.74 --> 791.95
adopted with these last few years

788.14 --> 794.23
there's just no such thing as as we live

791.95 --> 796.149
in a flat earth what is what is the

794.23 --> 799.149
flattered what is the proof for

796.149 --> 801.99
flattered I can say today we live in a

799.149 --> 807.16
spinning ball like I did three years ago

801.99 --> 811.05
why why do I have to believe this is a

807.16 --> 811.05
flat earth dr. Muir we'll come on

813.83 --> 822.2900000000001
oh all right and I'm not bullshitting

820.459 --> 825.2299999999999
I'm not rolling this is for real do you

822.29 --> 829.91
know I think this is my my new pad I

825.23 --> 832.22
need evidence for a flattered and I need

829.91 --> 835.43
evidence for a globe also but you know

832.22 --> 839.5
what it's easier to keep holding into

835.43 --> 843.1999999999999
the globe that I was on all my life and

839.5 --> 846.019
entertain the flattered because he is

843.2 --> 848.6600000000001
that you know flattered is a thing but

846.019 --> 851.329
but I don't know if we do the

848.66 --> 853.76
housekeeping questions I think I think I

851.329 --> 857.12
can nail them all of them yeah

853.76 --> 863.36
so I don't know I don't know it's just

857.12 --> 865.1
interesting my position now Wow what we

863.36 --> 867.11
have been doing with the debates pretty

865.1 --> 871.39
much it's very important because we've

867.11 --> 877.48
taught ourselves a rigorous discipline

871.39 --> 877.48
to point out almost through

878.6 --> 886.5500000000001
through these the art of bardic

882.24 --> 889.6800000000001
storytelling step-by-step-by-step

886.55 --> 892.55
pointing out the main flaws of the globe

889.68 --> 895.4399999999999
model as a defense mechanism

892.55 --> 898.77
Andy easy to memorize

895.44 --> 901.9200000000001
eventually defense mechanism against the

898.77 --> 904.35
globe indoctrination and that's what we

901.92 --> 908.49
created this what Nathan created would

904.35 --> 911.82
have to admit even John helped to create

908.49 --> 917.4
for whatever his thoughts are worth on

911.82 --> 921.45
average yeah we all made it and that is

917.4 --> 924.9
a useful tool that any flat earther that

921.45 --> 928.5600000000001
wishes to engage on that counter

924.9 --> 930.81
psychological warfare level can use can

928.56 --> 932.9399999999999
memorize and they will have it and they

930.81 --> 935.6999999999999
will keep it and even if the internet

932.94 --> 940.1400000000001
goes down I'll bet you they will never

935.7 --> 942.48
forget it so but yeah that's only one

940.14 --> 947.98
thing that we've created and there needs

942.48 --> 951.01
to be more so

947.98 --> 955.33
where do we go from here we have to

951.01 --> 958.98
study more and more the ones that are

955.33 --> 963.01
upholding the mechanisms and the ones

958.98 --> 965.26
that are receiving this religious

963.01 --> 967.0
information and accepting it and what

965.26 --> 970.3
are they doing with it we have to study

967.0 --> 973.42
what's really going on to get the total

970.3 --> 973.8399999999999
dynamics of it all and get a feel for

973.42 --> 978.4
that

973.84 --> 980.1700000000001
and then when enough people get that and

978.4 --> 982.9
I've been working on that specifically

980.17 --> 987.31
very hard naturally for a long time

982.9 --> 990.76
enough people get that then we can

987.31 --> 995.17
interact with it as with a religious

990.76 --> 998.17
community see think of think of it like

995.17 --> 1000.68
this the Christian community here in the

998.17 --> 1000.68
Netherlands

1002.19 --> 1008.8800000000001
there is a much better understanding in

1005.4 --> 1012.27
a sense from society towards them there

1008.88 --> 1016.26
it's growing and this helps

1012.27 --> 1020.34
this helps to iron things out to get a

1016.26 --> 1023.76
better collaboration and cooperation and

1020.34 --> 1025.829
so we need to do that as well we need to

1023.76 --> 1029.579
get that other side and we need to help

1025.829 --> 1031.62
them get us and then we can come

1029.579 --> 1034.26
together and see what we actually got

1031.62 --> 1037.35
here where we can maneuver towards and I

1034.26 --> 1041.49
already thought this out like yeah we we

1037.35 --> 1044.87
don't need to bend the ball we can just

1041.49 --> 1048.48
say okay this is a beautiful

1044.87 --> 1050.3999999999999
presuppositional dream and it is

1048.48 --> 1052.02
magnificent and very inspiring look at

1050.4 --> 1056.22
all the science fiction that's made with

1052.02 --> 1059.8799999999999
it it is not totally useless so we can

1056.22 --> 1062.67
maybe just may turn it into storytelling

1059.88 --> 1066.6000000000001
guild for example and just maintain it

1062.67 --> 1071.88
as a separate culture like that and that

1066.6 --> 1074.1599999999999
is a dynamic where together we migrate

1071.88 --> 1076.5300000000002
into the future and progress all

1074.16 --> 1081.63
together without getting into a giant

1076.53 --> 1084.35
war like clash because if that war like

1081.63 --> 1087.2600000000002
clash happens it's gonna be hell

1084.35 --> 1091.5
everybody's gonna go nuts

1087.26 --> 1096.0
if it happens to that level if we can't

1091.5 --> 1098.76
just work it out together and ballers

1096.0 --> 1102.84
really I even bothers that we no realize

1098.76 --> 1105.77
this you can feel it from them and a lot

1102.84 --> 1108.6899999999998
of flat earthers kind of also know it

1105.77 --> 1112.59
Patricia knows it yeah you know you know

1108.69 --> 1117.3600000000001
you know what the tricky part is that is

1112.59 --> 1119.97
so easy to visualize a working globe

1117.36 --> 1122.07
model I say working in quotes because

1119.97 --> 1125.19
there are holes there are gaps and I and

1122.07 --> 1129.3899999999999
I feel the same but you know how easy is

1125.19 --> 1131.88
to picture put yourself in a in a

1129.39 --> 1134.76
third-person view and see the globe how

1131.88 --> 1135.69
it works how beautiful they orbit all on

1134.76 --> 1137.82
the

1135.69 --> 1139.799
on the moon that starts everything you

1137.82 --> 1142.83
can see it all but then when I think

1139.799 --> 1148.07
about flat when I think about a

1142.83 --> 1150.149
flattered I I put myself in your shoes a

1148.07 --> 1155.4289999999999
rectangular looping model

1150.149 --> 1156.899
no man now a EMAP some kind of with a

1155.429 --> 1159.69
different rearrangement of the

1156.899 --> 1162.1789999999999
continents maybe a big plane of eyes

1159.69 --> 1164.039
with some continent and then what what

1162.179 --> 1168.1200000000001
is this sitting on how does it work I

1164.039 --> 1169.83
cannot picture are we I'm sorry but this

1168.12 --> 1172.5
is the realization I came yesterday I

1169.83 --> 1175.6789999999999
tried to to dream on it and sleep on it

1172.5 --> 1179.549
and I cannot picture it the the globe

1175.679 --> 1183.8700000000001
model works somehow you know I hate it's

1179.549 --> 1186.24
a it's filled in it's all filled in

1183.87 --> 1188.299
there's no blanks left you might not

1186.24 --> 1191.159
make a lot of sense scientifically

1188.299 --> 1194.6689999999999
physically long wise but it's all filled

1191.159 --> 1197.7
in that's their trick their suggestion

1194.669 --> 1200.22
is but we know it all there are so many

1197.7 --> 1202.6200000000001
things you don't know so we're gonna go

1200.22 --> 1209.25
with the thing that says it knows it all

1202.62 --> 1212.7589999999998
that's a big foundation I don't know

1209.25 --> 1215.039
nothing I've been ignorant all this time

1212.759 --> 1217.559
because I'm I'm trying to keep believing

1215.039 --> 1220.169
in this and holding it tight and tight

1217.559 --> 1223.379
and even myself I'm catching freaking

1220.169 --> 1225.7990000000002
glow proofs with my forest not abode not

1223.379 --> 1226.9499999999998
a mirage but the obstruction is

1225.799 --> 1229.35
ridiculous

1226.95 --> 1233.039
obstruction is not necessarily curvature

1229.35 --> 1235.35
okay but [ __ ] or obstruction now look at

1233.039 --> 1237.629
soundly Buddhists as a straight breeze

1235.35 --> 1239.4599999999998
and if I go over there I can record the

1237.629 --> 1241.7099999999998
same effect I don't know how to explain

1239.46 --> 1243.8990000000001
that in a platter look at Timmy Osmond

1241.71 --> 1246.8400000000001
foolish the obstruction the higher you

1243.899 --> 1249.2399999999998
go the more you see how can you you

1246.84 --> 1251.549
explain that in a flower my observation

1249.24 --> 1252.8990000000001
they bridge I can see that tippy tops

1251.549 --> 1254.73
when I took food of the water

1252.899 --> 1257.6999999999998
I can see halfway when I'm twenty foot

1254.73 --> 1262.45
above the water what is going on man I

1257.7 --> 1265.8400000000001
mean really when year

1262.45 --> 1267.1000000000001
you didn't understand that footage it's

1265.84 --> 1268.859
pretty obvious isn't it

1267.1 --> 1271.7199999999998
I don't understand that I see it to a

1268.859 --> 1274.539
20-story building when I'm 8 miles away

1271.72 --> 1276.609
and I can see it all pretty much down to

1274.539 --> 1279.009
the to the grass in the bottom but when

1276.609 --> 1281.08
I'm 20 miles away every when I'm 25

1279.009 --> 1284.6490000000001
miles away I can see only half of the

1281.08 --> 1287.47
building man how is this possible well

1284.649 --> 1290.35
because of the the perspective effect

1287.47 --> 1292.33
because of the optical slant it starts

1290.35 --> 1296.109
after a certain distance and then

1292.33 --> 1298.899
increases or rather the Mirage own zone

1296.109 --> 1301.899
springing from that point on from where

1298.899 --> 1304.7489999999998
the horizon is visible to the eye or the

1301.899 --> 1306.58
camera from that point on from that

1304.749 --> 1308.499
slant point on that's when the Mirage

1306.58 --> 1311.889
ink starts so if something is simply not

1308.499 --> 1314.919
far off far away enough in relation to

1311.889 --> 1319.359
the observer I'd then you'll just see it

1314.919 --> 1321.46
entirely it's only after it becomes far

1319.359 --> 1324.1899999999998
away enough that the viewing angle

1321.46 --> 1326.47
becomes so low that the optical slant

1324.19 --> 1329.289
will start to occur and the further away

1326.47 --> 1333.269
the more will be obstructed within that

1329.289 --> 1333.269
Mirage in zone being reflected

1334.77 --> 1339.51
I haven't been approached by anybody I

1337.169 --> 1342.21
haven't been talked to by anybody

1339.51 --> 1344.01
I'm broker than ever I'm in a really

1342.21 --> 1345.63
tough economical situation I'm

1344.01 --> 1347.549
struggling mentally with this with this

1345.63 --> 1349.3200000000002
thing I'm just just clearing the [ __ ] up

1347.549 --> 1351.149
because people all he's being approached

1349.32 --> 1353.37
he being talked to they send in the

1351.149 --> 1356.2199999999998
check on the paper and he is whatever

1353.37 --> 1358.76
[ __ ] somebody talked to him [ __ ]

1356.22 --> 1361.95
this is this is this is what I call

1358.76 --> 1363.62
[ __ ] I don't want to praise aa-are I

1361.95 --> 1368.46
don't want it I don't want to just

1363.62 --> 1371.25
believe something that's why flat the

1368.46 --> 1373.26
belief in the Flat Earth he and the

1371.25 --> 1376.039
belief in the globe they are in the same

1373.26 --> 1379.559
boat you know they are in the same boat

1376.039 --> 1382.289
but being an agent Bennett she'll been

1379.559 --> 1385.4089999999999
approached that is [ __ ] just me

1382.289 --> 1389.19
saying it my testimony me I just lay I

1385.409 --> 1391.47
just listen last night Flattr debate 214

1389.19 --> 1392.909
is the first time that I appear in the

1391.47 --> 1394.8600000000001
in denied on of the show it was

1392.909 --> 1396.0900000000001
beautiful I love myself listened to

1394.86 --> 1398.7299999999998
myself as a placeholder

1396.09 --> 1401.49
I seen my journey I seen how I wish this

1398.73 --> 1404.669
point and I say last night I have to

1401.49 --> 1406.23
speak up you know because it's not that

1404.669 --> 1407.429
I've been holding it back but something

1406.23 --> 1410.94
click and I got it

1407.429 --> 1414.8700000000001
I gotta stick my mind the most honest

1410.94 --> 1417.1490000000001
way and and this clarity I believe I

1414.87 --> 1419.61
don't wanna argue in favor of the globe

1417.149 --> 1422.2199999999998
why don't running argue you against the

1419.61 --> 1425.58
flat earth but let's be real what is the

1422.22 --> 1428.789
proof of a flutter leave what are you

1425.58 --> 1431.25
doing I'm sorry how is it a belief and I

1428.789 --> 1433.429
disagree wholeheartedly flat earth and

1431.25 --> 1436.529
the globe are not in the same boat

1433.429 --> 1439.5590000000002
absolutely not we're all in the same

1436.529 --> 1441.45
world we have to share it but the entire

1439.559 --> 1443.4289999999999
approach and the reason and the

1441.45 --> 1446.3300000000002
motivation that lay behind it are

1443.429 --> 1446.3300000000002
completely different

1447.05 --> 1451.85
so and I know this Ben this is on the

1449.9 --> 1454.8500000000001
air this is prerecorded and I want to be

1451.85 --> 1456.8
heard and I'm probably gonna do a little

1454.85 --> 1458.99
live-streaming later I was playing

1456.8 --> 1461.12
myself maybe not even better maybe worse

1458.99 --> 1464.84
but I'm gonna speak up the same because

1461.12 --> 1466.55
I sentiment out you're on my show you

1464.84 --> 1470.3
brought this up out of nowhere so

1466.55 --> 1472.82
explain it that's what I want to bring

1470.3 --> 1475.85
this is my sentiment that I'm thinking

1472.82 --> 1477.8
like I love being in your show I love

1475.85 --> 1482.06
being in Nathan show I love being in in

1477.8 --> 1483.68
in other hangouts and [ __ ] but but what

1482.06 --> 1486.31
is it what is the evidence for a flutter

1483.68 --> 1493.88
our wing gave me something the

1486.31 --> 1495.4099999999999
geometrical deduction very simple things

1493.88 --> 1497.8700000000001
orbiter is one thing

1495.41 --> 1499.43
no there is no curvature because then if

1497.87 --> 1501.4399999999998
there was curvature then there would be

1499.43 --> 1505.52
a cumulative drop and there is no sign

1501.44 --> 1508.15
of that whatsoever at all but when I'm

1505.52 --> 1511.28
look any Sun is there any deduce of all

1508.15 --> 1511.73
geometrical sense and that is a telltale

1511.28 --> 1516.82
sign

1511.73 --> 1519.68
how about deduction on that perception

1516.82 --> 1525.26
then there's only so many geometrical

1519.68 --> 1529.0700000000002
options left okay a geometrical drop if

1525.26 --> 1533.21
I'm not misunderstanding I'm looking at

1529.07 --> 1536.12
a bridge is 400 foot high is 100 foot

1533.21 --> 1538.31
clearance and 300 foot above the water

1536.12 --> 1541.79
so it's formed a full ride I'm looking

1538.31 --> 1545.6299999999999
at the bridge 27 miles away I'm looking

1541.79 --> 1547.22
to foot above the water let me finish 42

1545.63 --> 1549.47
foot above the water and I can see just

1547.22 --> 1551.21
the tippy top of the bridge okay it

1549.47 --> 1553.49
might be the waves yeah I understand

1551.21 --> 1555.47
that but then I stand up six foot above

1553.49 --> 1559.31
the water and I can see a little bit

1555.47 --> 1562.04
more then I go up the hill a little bit

1559.31 --> 1564.26
damn twelve foot above the water I can

1562.04 --> 1566.57
see a lot more and then I climb in top

1564.26 --> 1570.62
of my car and I'm 20 foot above the

1566.57 --> 1575.86
water and I see more that sounds the

1570.62 --> 1575.86
geometrical to me and a cumulative drop

1576.19 --> 1582.56
absolutely not how are you coming to

1580.22 --> 1587.27
this conclusion the geometrical dog drop

1582.56 --> 1590.36
is what is beyond all that how the

1587.27 --> 1593.42
supposed presumed curve is shaped and

1590.36 --> 1596.6299999999999
it's slanted there may be a curved

1593.42 --> 1598.97
section within an optical curved section

1596.63 --> 1603.0500000000002
within an observation it's only gonna be

1598.97 --> 1605.51
a tiny part that's the whole deal up

1603.05 --> 1608.48
until that point it's all straight and

1605.51 --> 1611.54
from that point on it's also all

1608.48 --> 1614.93
straight up to as far as you can see due

1611.54 --> 1617.21
to air clarity conditions that's the

1614.93 --> 1622.16
geometry that's the geometrical deduce

1617.21 --> 1624.5
deduction part it's not cumulative it

1622.16 --> 1628.21
doesn't keep on dropping dropping

1624.5 --> 1628.21
steeper doesn't happen

1630.05 --> 1636.6499999999999
and then I'm trying to find this X Y

1633.14 --> 1639.0500000000002
whatever the horizontal curvature it's

1636.65 --> 1642.3200000000002
not gonna be found because I don't have

1639.05 --> 1645.44
that big view you know I don't have the

1642.32 --> 1647.24
mileage long way to see the curvature

1645.44 --> 1650.27
but I can see it straight ahead because

1647.24 --> 1652.79
I can see more obstruction the lower I

1650.27 --> 1654.679
go and the further desktop is it's

1652.79 --> 1657.05
obstruct a big time are we done it's

1654.679 --> 1660.02
difficult to explain it with this angle

1657.05 --> 1662.48
or angle of view and this Mirage not at

1660.02 --> 1664.04
all that's not difficult at all and I

1662.48 --> 1666.47
find it very odd that you're not

1664.04 --> 1668.8
responding to the things I'm saying

1666.47 --> 1675.98
you're sounding very much like a baller

1668.8 --> 1678.6789999999999
right now is no I want a response right

1675.98 --> 1681.91
now remember what I said in the previous

1678.679 --> 1685.99
after your previous question I explained

1681.91 --> 1689.809
the geometrical factor the straight line

1685.99 --> 1695.98
the non-cumulative nature of the drop

1689.809 --> 1699.41
Beyond so respond to that now

1695.98 --> 1702.74
okay so behind that bridge there's more

1699.41 --> 1704.96
structures same height approximately and

1702.74 --> 1706.97
I don't see him they are behind that

1704.96 --> 1709.48
community never know they're you know

1706.97 --> 1709.48
they're not

1713.84 --> 1720.8
and then this 20 years in going it keeps

1718.28 --> 1722.51
on going that's the funny part yeah

1720.8 --> 1724.46
things are gonna be obstructed but

1722.51 --> 1727.37
you're still gonna see things very very

1724.46 --> 1730.64
far away if the air clarity it's good

1727.37 --> 1734.9899999999998
enough and you should write an equation

1730.64 --> 1737.3600000000001
never you shouldn't ever okay if there

1734.99 --> 1742.79
is a cumulative drop you shouldn't see

1737.36 --> 1744.2299999999998
that ever in any picture ever right and

1742.79 --> 1747.83
I can't wait to go to the same spot and

1744.23 --> 1751.55
get a really clear day and and document

1747.83 --> 1753.11
this obstruction in a very clear day

1751.55 --> 1754.79
because it was a really clear day when I

1753.11 --> 1759.11
catch it but I want to repeat it again

1754.79 --> 1760.85
and again I don't know what's with you

1759.11 --> 1763.6699999999998
how is everyone I don't like you like

1760.85 --> 1765.35
this ah I'm sorry man no problem that's

1763.67 --> 1768.5600000000002
what I'm saying I mean this is this is

1765.35 --> 1770.78
this is what I came this is this I slap

1768.56 --> 1773.1499999999999
on this yes I just didn't sleep [ __ ]

1770.78 --> 1774.98
because I worked last night so I was my

1773.15 --> 1777.3200000000002
brain was brainstorming last night like

1774.98 --> 1780.5
what do i do how do I approach this - I

1777.32 --> 1782.84
do I continue being this mellow guy

1780.5 --> 1785.54
agreeing and a safe teen and kind of

1782.84 --> 1787.82
following both I feel this ingenious

1785.54 --> 1789.8899999999999
doing it because it's a belief man and I

1787.82 --> 1791.8999999999999
hate belief I always say it like it's

1789.89 --> 1794.1200000000001
nice you're alluding yourself you're

1791.9 --> 1796.3100000000002
going the baller delusion right or out

1794.12 --> 1798.4099999999999
right now you're flipping it all around

1796.31 --> 1800.8999999999999
through seeds of doubt that you're

1798.41 --> 1804.8600000000001
allowing to seed in your mind confusing

1800.9 --> 1807.17
you it's not a belief it's a geometrical

1804.86 --> 1809.51
deduction I explained this to you didn't

1807.17 --> 1812.23
use the word belief didn't use the word

1809.51 --> 1815.33
imagined it's basic logic it's geometry

1812.23 --> 1818.3600000000001
okay and you're not listening you're

1815.33 --> 1821.56
acting like a baller and you need to

1818.36 --> 1824.87
reach inside of your head right now and

1821.56 --> 1829.7
see what's going on there right did you

1824.87 --> 1831.4699999999998
get like weird freaky dreams I walk last

1829.7 --> 1833.75
night I haven't slept since yesterday

1831.47 --> 1835.28
morning right okay well you need to get

1833.75 --> 1837.88
some sleep because you're not yourself

1835.28 --> 1837.8799999999999
right now

1838.19 --> 1843.68
oh I am I am like more myself than I

1841.64 --> 1846.2
ever know you're not feeling like the

1843.68 --> 1850.0700000000002
person that you want to be that we want

1846.2 --> 1853.73
you to be okay you're acting deluded

1850.07 --> 1856.36
this is not you I am going to continue

1853.73 --> 1860.81
being myself I gonna speak up everyone

1856.36 --> 1862.76
owns him this is not good

1860.81 --> 1868.6699999999998
you're not responding you're not

1862.76 --> 1871.1299999999999
listening and you're repeating a

1868.67 --> 1874.5500000000002
narrative that has no foundational

1871.13 --> 1876.5900000000001
reasons maybe you say it's oblique I

1874.55 --> 1879.47
don't want I don't you keep your

1876.59 --> 1881.4199999999998
literally starting a rumpus narrative in

1879.47 --> 1886.28
your mind to deflect everything you're

1881.42 --> 1890.5700000000002
walking away right no walking away man I

1886.28 --> 1893.69
mean neighborhood nowhere yeah you are

1890.57 --> 1896.8999999999999
you are walking away from it all you're

1893.69 --> 1900.71
spelling it out right here I'm going

1896.9 --> 1906.3500000000001
nowhere I love I love this universe it's

1900.71 --> 1909.3500000000001
not a belief it is flat okay so how many

1906.35 --> 1912.11
magic did in my life given every things

1909.35 --> 1915.8899999999999
may result in there is no cumulative

1912.11 --> 1918.08
drop there's no sign of it okay give me

1915.89 --> 1920.8100000000002
a little flatter 101 how do I picture

1918.08 --> 1922.3999999999999
this flattered and and something simple

1920.81 --> 1927.56
like the Sun and the moon let's plane it

1922.4 --> 1932.5700000000002
to me no that's your own freakin problem

1927.56 --> 1934.58
okay you imagine it is not here

1932.57 --> 1938.09
represent you with the complete picture

1934.58 --> 1939.9199999999998
stop being a freaking baby demanding the

1938.09 --> 1942.77
whole picture you're not gonna get it I

1939.92 --> 1944.42
don't get it yet we're figuring it out

1942.77 --> 1946.31
that's the whole freaking purpose of

1944.42 --> 1950.63
this stop being a baby

1946.31 --> 1954.8799999999999
I like your arguments that are before

1950.63 --> 1954.88
you it's not a belief

1956.64 --> 1961.0800000000002
yeah actually either believe or we're

1959.34 --> 1962.8799999999999
not for real it's a geometrical

1961.08 --> 1969.4189999999999
deduction there is no cumulative drop

1962.88 --> 1971.8500000000001
ever okay let's not know here it is no

1969.419 --> 1973.5
near over distance okay let's say

1971.85 --> 1976.4399999999998
there's no community drop I gave you

1973.5 --> 1979.32
that how does this how how do I picture

1976.44 --> 1982.409
this flattered and and everything else

1979.32 --> 1984.3899999999999
does it continue you see the dome you

1982.409 --> 1988.19
see the infinite plane is it a looping

1984.39 --> 1992.76
model how how is it well I don't know

1988.19 --> 1994.71
there's certain ways to find it out and

1992.76 --> 1998.37
I talked about it on Flat Earth talks a

1994.71 --> 2002.57
lot right we need to figure out is the

1998.37 --> 2005.9289999999999
horizon line the horizon all right sorry

2002.57 --> 2008.6
the equator line is that a line is it a

2005.929 --> 2011.299
straight line very very important to

2008.6 --> 2014.799
figure out and of course the earth

2011.299 --> 2017.029
equator line is based on the celestial

2014.799 --> 2019.789
orientation on when the Sun where the

2017.029 --> 2022.399
Sun is highest so we need to figure that

2019.789 --> 2024.4089999999999
out okay is it a straight line or is it

2022.399 --> 2030.52
a circle I'm Michael leaders you know

2024.409 --> 2033.679
that then we can exclude other options

2030.52 --> 2038.12
we need to know the geometrical nature

2033.679 --> 2041.779
of the layout of the world I think this

2038.12 --> 2043.9599999999998
little is what is it I think this little

2041.779 --> 2048.619
turn on my on my head on my on my

2043.96 --> 2050.7200000000003
believe he started with Dell yelling at

2048.619 --> 2054.3790000000004
me because I find his approach

2050.72 --> 2055.97
ridiculous bro how how in the [ __ ] are

2054.379 --> 2058.2799999999997
we not going to be able to present any

2055.97 --> 2060.74
any visuals any footage he's doing a

2058.28 --> 2062.8390000000004
freaking YouTube YouTube videos are we

2060.74 --> 2064.879
watching it on a video if you don't want

2062.839 --> 2067.25
to figure out where we live did a video

2064.879 --> 2069.2599999999998
foolish this is a good start but then

2067.25 --> 2072.379
when I see you want to see bendy water

2069.26 --> 2075.409
what I am i what am i a waterbender okay

2072.379 --> 2077.659
a Harry Potter to show you gas pressure

2075.409 --> 2080.54
without a container is impossible are we

2077.659 --> 2083.599
they globe model works okay you so it

2080.54 --> 2085.46
doesn't work you know in your heart away

2083.599 --> 2087.8
from being kicked and banned ear if

2085.46 --> 2088.919
you're gonna repeat that in front of my

2087.8 --> 2090.9900000000002
face

2088.919 --> 2093.359
because you're betraying me you're

2090.99 --> 2096.5
betraying my trust I'm gonna train you

2093.359 --> 2099.269
we have your heart you are you are

2096.5 --> 2102.839
you're turning away from everything you

2099.269 --> 2105.089
learned throw you know I got everything

2102.839 --> 2108.18
this has been knowledge for me the I

2105.089 --> 2111.15
like throwing your garbage can and I can

2108.18 --> 2115.23
the journey continue look at it if you

2111.15 --> 2118.049
want to wallow back in the ditch and

2115.23 --> 2119.309
believe the precious globe and that it's

2118.049 --> 2121.2
all works out

2119.309 --> 2124.38
start perpetuating all that superficial

2121.2 --> 2127.049
[ __ ] that we've been trying to dispel

2124.38 --> 2130.9500000000003
you do that you do that not on my show

2127.049 --> 2132.42
thank you very much okay so the globe to

2130.95 --> 2134.7889999999998
the globe model is broken

2132.42 --> 2137.46
okay the globe more it is and that means

2134.789 --> 2142.5
it's not real if it's broken it means

2137.46 --> 2144.39
it's not real you got that exactly the

2142.5 --> 2147.0
globe model is broken I don't understand

2144.39 --> 2148.44
of the argument I can just believing and

2147.0 --> 2150.42
run away but I don't want to believe

2148.44 --> 2153.66
them that's the thing but he bought the

2150.42 --> 2156.9500000000003
in the same breath is a flat earth no

2153.66 --> 2162.0589999999997
it's not we don't want to have a model

2156.95 --> 2164.22
I'm not we don't not have ideas we have

2162.059 --> 2166.1400000000003
muscles we don't have a model we don't

2164.22 --> 2168.24
claim a model because we don't have all

2166.14 --> 2171.6299999999997
the information we have just some

2168.24 --> 2174.299
information like your cumulative drop

2171.63 --> 2177.0
into the distance it's a very important

2174.299 --> 2179.779
fact and where we go from there

2177.0 --> 2182.849
well we have to figure out the layout is

2179.779 --> 2187.009
the equator a straight line or is it a

2182.849 --> 2189.539
circle it's a very important one and

2187.009 --> 2192.359
there's so much more even beyond that

2189.539 --> 2198.21
that we can still do in this realm

2192.359 --> 2200.54
legally might be dangerous but can be

2198.21 --> 2202.76
done and we will do that

2200.54 --> 2204.8
whoever that's gonna turn out to be

2202.76 --> 2209.63
maybe I will do it I wanted to do it I

2204.8 --> 2212.2400000000002
might be able to do it but we're not

2209.63 --> 2214.46
there yet so we can spend you know what

2212.24 --> 2216.41
the thing is I have being asked question

2214.46 --> 2218.48
hey how does this work or how do you

2216.41 --> 2220.58
explain this and I say I really don't

2218.48 --> 2222.65
know you needed do you and it's true and

2220.58 --> 2224.24
let me let me speak for a minute

2222.65 --> 2226.58
ah they've always ask me how does this

2224.24 --> 2228.0499999999997
work I said I have no idea neither do

2226.58 --> 2231.44
you you just believe it it's true

2228.05 --> 2233.8100000000004
and how does why do you how do you

2231.44 --> 2236.15
explain this I have no idea

2233.81 --> 2238.22
neither do you I got a I got a story I

2236.15 --> 2239.869
can explain it to you with with an

2238.22 --> 2243.77
explanation but you got this another

2239.869 --> 2246.5
explanation different so it's a 50/50

2243.77 --> 2248.03
chance now when I when I think my stuff

2246.5 --> 2249.92
I say I don't know I cannot explain

2248.03 --> 2253.25
anything on the flattered

2249.92 --> 2255.71
I cannot visualize anything I don't have

2253.25 --> 2257.51
any I cannot make any claims in favor of

2255.71 --> 2260.9
flattered because I can not defend it so

2257.51 --> 2263.2700000000004
I say this is maybe that's due to memory

2260.9 --> 2265.369
loss because you haven't had a good

2263.27 --> 2268.609
night's sleep and you kind of can't

2265.369 --> 2272.15
handle the level intellectually that is

2268.609 --> 2275.72
required to understand it maybe maybe

2272.15 --> 2279.38
that maybe that's me because I couldn't

2275.72 --> 2281.6
repay I have learn a lot but I know all

2279.38 --> 2285.44
the arguments what I really cannot

2281.6 --> 2287.359
defend them because it's a bit now

2285.44 --> 2290.18
because you have a lack of sleep and

2287.359 --> 2293.33
you're not acting very wise with that

2290.18 --> 2296.5899999999997
knowledge you know when you're weakened

2293.33 --> 2299.359
you don't work fully and you can't

2296.59 --> 2301.9700000000003
expect to have the same grasp on reality

2299.359 --> 2307.0699999999997
as when you're just normally arrested

2301.97 --> 2308.99
that's maybe here for two years I don't

2307.07 --> 2311.03
have any flattered proof I don't have it

2308.99 --> 2312.5299999999997
I cannot back up any claims I can make

2311.03 --> 2315.0800000000004
that's why I don't make any claims I

2312.53 --> 2318.17
cannot explain anything that they Globe

2315.08 --> 2318.71
moral can explain so what am I doing

2318.17 --> 2320.84
here

2318.71 --> 2324.35
I judge should I just continue believe

2320.84 --> 2326.09
in doing and even the flattery then this

2324.35 --> 2332.2999999999997
I'm sick I'm having a discussion with

2326.09 --> 2333.98
you I don't like it I don't see this is

2332.3 --> 2336.799
good no it's not good

2333.98 --> 2341.42
it's very negative what you doing no

2336.799 --> 2344.599
you're not being constructive it's not

2341.42 --> 2347.1800000000003
good and I found my middle ground they

2344.599 --> 2348.7400000000002
say oh you a flip-flop because you argue

2347.18 --> 2351.44
here you are Rogen in here and then you

2348.74 --> 2355.609
behave in here yes that's me but this is

2351.44 --> 2358.43
me now speaking my real feelings you

2355.609 --> 2362.96
know and I feel really means that you're

2358.43 --> 2365.569
a two tongued snake and a liar if that's

2362.96 --> 2368.299
the case I have never been I was just

2365.569 --> 2371.329
maybe already back my real but you go

2368.299 --> 2374.24
along with it and you say to say you say

2371.329 --> 2376.46
the sayings you you agree and now you're

2374.24 --> 2376.79
saying oh no no that's actually all not

2376.46 --> 2383.42
true

2376.79 --> 2385.79
so you're a liar no nothing maybe I want

2383.42 --> 2387.859
to tell you we're not you're throwing

2385.79 --> 2390.44
everything you're throwing your dignity

2387.859 --> 2393.29
overboard by this no no no maybe I want

2390.44 --> 2394.94
to easy yeah it's very difficult for me

2393.29 --> 2396.5589999999997
to explain the flutter it's a lot easier

2394.94 --> 2400.9700000000003
to explain the ball you know because we

2396.559 --> 2409.3390000000004
all know how it works now except it

2400.97 --> 2412.79
doesn't work I agree with you that is

2409.339 --> 2415.069
broken except the truth because you can

2412.79 --> 2416.9
explain it even though you know it

2415.069 --> 2421.099
doesn't work and it is a lie is that

2416.9 --> 2421.64
okay but it's a little bit broken it's

2421.099 --> 2425.3590000000004
different

2421.64 --> 2429.319
no just a little broken he's not even

2425.359 --> 2431.839
broken it is broken it is broken it has

2429.319 --> 2434.48
been broken for a century

2431.839 --> 2436.43
so where with all that money with

2434.48 --> 2438.2
everything with all the enthusiasts with

2436.43 --> 2440.5099999999998
all the nerds and the geeks and their

2438.2 --> 2444.41
machinations what why isn't it fixed

2440.51 --> 2447.829
Jose I can drive across but could it be

2444.41 --> 2450.14
because could it be because could it be

2447.829 --> 2455.809
because it can't be fixed

2450.14 --> 2460.0099999999998
because it's not real okay my answer is

2455.809 --> 2462.2000000000003
I can for sure drive a broken car but I

2460.01 --> 2465.8900000000003
cannot drive an imaginary car

2462.2 --> 2467.93
thus a globe versus a flirt a broken car

2465.89 --> 2470.72
is a globe I can drive it

2467.93 --> 2472.97
Figg imaginary car that's the flutter

2470.72 --> 2474.77
that's what we do imagine oh no you got

2472.97 --> 2477.6099999999997
it exactly the other way around I mean

2474.77 --> 2480.29
that's what I ridiculous it's ridiculous

2477.61 --> 2484.1600000000003
if the model is broken if these things

2480.29 --> 2485.6
don't work then you can say that you're

2484.16 --> 2487.85
driving around because then you're

2485.6 --> 2489.47
assuming it's functioning it's not the

2487.85 --> 2491.93
only place it's functioning is in the

2489.47 --> 2494.24
imagination of the people that refuse to

2491.93 --> 2497.45
think about it deeper as to what they're

2494.24 --> 2500.93
accepting it's broken it's not

2497.45 --> 2505.04
functioning a broken car with a crashed

2500.93 --> 2507.62
engine doesn't Drive Jose you can drive

2505.04 --> 2514.63
around in a broken model in a broken car

2507.62 --> 2514.63
doesn't work and yeah fine you leave

2518.28 --> 2523.36
I thought you can kick me I dropped

2520.81 --> 2527.08
sorry no no no if I'm gonna kick you

2523.36 --> 2529.8700000000003
you're gonna hear it thank you but

2527.08 --> 2531.63
you're being ridiculous absolutely you

2529.87 --> 2536.29
know why do we think it is

2531.63 --> 2537.4900000000002
it's just I'm embarrassed for you man I

2536.29 --> 2539.92
really am

2537.49 --> 2540.64
oh man I feel like a relief in my

2539.92 --> 2547.29
shoulders

2540.64 --> 2550.96
I feel like a relief you know the song I

2547.29 --> 2551.56
remember when I remember when I lost my

2550.96 --> 2555.79
mind

2551.56 --> 2559.27
what's such a amazing feeling

2555.79 --> 2561.37
their relief everything had an echo yeah

2559.27 --> 2562.68
that's what that is that's what that is

2561.37 --> 2565.42
Jose

2562.68 --> 2571.4199999999996
that's that relief it's a relief of

2565.42 --> 2574.12
giving up I'm not giving up but are you

2571.42 --> 2575.65
all right no you're not overboard you're

2574.12 --> 2578.89
throwing reason overboard you're

2575.65 --> 2581.71
flip-flopping on everything only only

2578.89 --> 2584.44
because you're sick of it you can't

2581.71 --> 2586.09
handle that anymore oh I love fluttered

2584.44 --> 2589.06
me and I love it and I wanna I wanna

2586.09 --> 2591.73
comedy part of this of the seek for

2589.06 --> 2594.49
truth I want to find that the truth

2591.73 --> 2597.58
behind everything but with this with

2594.49 --> 2599.8599999999997
this take I'm gonna take on it yes I got

2597.58 --> 2601.36
a 50-50 basket now I got the globe in

2599.86 --> 2605.07
one side I got the flower in the notice

2601.36 --> 2607.8700000000003
I understand hey there's a glow but

2605.07 --> 2610.6600000000003
people believe that Earth don't accept

2607.87 --> 2613.33
that I don't accept it other peoples

2610.66 --> 2615.0099999999998
have been very annoyed by this I've

2613.33 --> 2617.98
given you some room I've heard some

2615.01 --> 2619.96
things and never seen I always thought

2617.98 --> 2621.16
like oh maybe you're fooling around but

2619.96 --> 2622.15
what you're doing right now that's not

2621.16 --> 2625.66
fooling around

2622.15 --> 2629.17
I've told you okay you can't do that

2625.66 --> 2631.06
[ __ ] with me okay you two--you this

2629.17 --> 2634.48
might be like some kind of joke like oh

2631.06 --> 2636.43
no I am like 12 years old again I can

2634.48 --> 2642.0
just act out like a teen and not take

2636.43 --> 2645.04
away this bro I don't know what it is

2642.0 --> 2645.63
why you're doing this what you're

2645.04 --> 2647.49
throwing

2645.63 --> 2649.259
everything overboard and yeah the Globes

2647.49 --> 2651.5389999999998
gonna like it you're they're gonna love

2649.259 --> 2654.69
you all they'll accept all your foolish

2651.539 --> 2656.6090000000004
belief in the flatter your lack of proof

2654.69 --> 2659.43
and how you finally came to your senses

2656.609 --> 2661.44
lovely you go having with those

2659.43 --> 2664.47
religious nut cases okay you do that

2661.44 --> 2666.779
have fun with them it's always something

2664.47 --> 2667.98
to do always something crazy some stupid

2666.779 --> 2670.71
infighting happening

2667.98 --> 2675.9900000000002
some people go nuts lovely lovely you go

2670.71 --> 2678.69
there okay we me people that I trust

2675.99 --> 2681.0
that I'll deal with we deal with ethics

2678.69 --> 2683.94
we deal with the narrow paths we deal

2681.0 --> 2686.13
with the truth and you can't just throw

2683.94 --> 2687.2400000000002
your [ __ ] overboard because if you're

2686.13 --> 2690.15
gonna do that that's gonna have

2687.24 --> 2692.6699999999996
consequences people are not gonna accept

2690.15 --> 2695.039
that you just do it like that you know

2692.67 --> 2697.619
it's what P Mars has basically been

2695.039 --> 2700.38
doing to another level not comparing you

2697.619 --> 2704.2400000000002
directly to that but it's what he does

2700.38 --> 2707.339
in his own way even worse and nobody

2704.24 --> 2712.3489999999997
really accepts him nobody will trust him

2707.339 --> 2715.89
ever again okay so be careful where you

2712.349 --> 2719.13
thread yeah you can straight a path okay

2715.89 --> 2722.569
God allows that but you can't do it

2719.13 --> 2725.279
without consequences it's very simple

2722.569 --> 2727.2
there's nothing to believe I have

2725.279 --> 2731.13
nothing to me now if it has to do with

2727.2 --> 2738.269
energy and with how creation works so

2731.13 --> 2740.039
hello Erik Bush a and flatlines hold on

2738.269 --> 2741.9599999999996
let me let me let me get this out I have

2740.039 --> 2744.779
lost so many nights I have a had so many

2741.96 --> 2748.079
fights with my wife about this and I had

2744.779 --> 2749.549
I lost a lot of respect from my family

2748.079 --> 2752.25
with this flattered because I was

2749.549 --> 2755.49
holding into it really hard I think it's

2752.25 --> 2759.299
gonna be a lot easier now yeah accepting

2755.49 --> 2761.609
that it has been a pipe dream for me I

2759.299 --> 2764.069
believe that I had about this fluttered

2761.609 --> 2766.3489999999997
and I feel lovely isn't it

2764.069 --> 2768.66
all you'd have to do is basically give

2766.349 --> 2771.6600000000003
up your soul and now finally everything

2768.66 --> 2774.06
is all that pressure all that big tests

2771.66 --> 2776.1299999999997
it's all going away now you

2774.06 --> 2782.16
have to worry about it anymore go ahead

2776.13 --> 2784.4100000000003
guys look at me no I'm still here how is

2782.16 --> 2787.8599999999997
it go ahead no go ahead go ahead yeah

2784.41 --> 2790.56
I'm done good oh yes so what why are you

2787.86 --> 2792.69
worried about what your family is saying

2790.56 --> 2794.2799999999997
you know like about you know cuz if they

2792.69 --> 2796.83
believe in a ball earth and you believe

2794.28 --> 2799.05
in a flat earth why why are you worried

2796.83 --> 2801.15
about what they're saying and you know

2799.05 --> 2804.77
trying to put in your head it's your

2801.15 --> 2807.63
body you can do whatever you want I

2804.77 --> 2810.03
don't do this because of the peer

2807.63 --> 2812.46
pressure and my family wants this for me

2810.03 --> 2814.94
you know I do this for myself for my own

2812.46 --> 2817.77
well-being for my own mental health

2814.94 --> 2819.12
right right well what kind of research

2817.77 --> 2824.46
have you been doing have you been

2819.12 --> 2826.43
talking to other people a lot faster you

2824.46 --> 2829.86
have been the same I've been in very him

2826.43 --> 2832.6499999999996
variety of different plataforms ballers

2829.86 --> 2834.9900000000002
and Florida's and I love all the

2832.65 --> 2837.0
community I love hanging out with people

2834.99 --> 2839.5499999999997
I love chatting with everybody but I

2837.0 --> 2842.19
just realized that this flutter is I

2839.55 --> 2845.25
believe I got and I don't know what I'm

2842.19 --> 2847.2000000000003
pushing it if if they believe they you

2845.25 --> 2847.71
should have just gotten a full-body

2847.2 --> 2858.7799999999997
massage

2847.71 --> 2861.66
instead yeah I wouldn't worry about what

2858.78 --> 2863.9700000000003
anybody else says Jose because even with

2861.66 --> 2865.6499999999996
me even with my family and I got family

2863.97 --> 2868.8599999999997
in the military I got family in the

2865.65 --> 2872.4300000000003
government so in the CIA and you know

2868.86 --> 2874.11
air marshals so you know and they give

2872.43 --> 2875.94
me crap about it all the time do they

2874.11 --> 2878.55
say I'm wrong no they don't say I'm

2875.94 --> 2881.01
wrong they I have a belief and that's

2878.55 --> 2882.0600000000004
what I believe in you know I don't but

2881.01 --> 2884.9700000000003
you know I don't believe in a

2882.06 --> 2887.19
heliocentric model like you know like my

2884.97 --> 2889.08
Uncle John you know no no he gives me

2887.19 --> 2891.2400000000002
credit because as long as you're out

2889.08 --> 2892.89
there doing research because people

2891.24 --> 2895.5899999999997
haven't done research in over a hundred

2892.89 --> 2898.62
years so how can you believe what

2895.59 --> 2901.55
they've told you in school you know like

2898.62 --> 2901.5499999999997
you want to do your own research

2902.82 --> 2910.52
I have been doing that big-time and then

2907.95 --> 2912.72
until eyes are getting foolish of

2910.52 --> 2914.46
obstruction in the horizon that is very

2912.72 --> 2921.8399999999997
hard to explain it in a flurry bro

2914.46 --> 2924.18
that's it what's your t900 indeed well

2921.84 --> 2929.88
you're talking about like like water

2924.18 --> 2932.64
obstruction yes see because you get that

2929.88 --> 2936.51
and anything because water you know like

2932.64 --> 2939.0299999999997
oceans they have salt in them so you

2936.51 --> 2941.82
have this that little debris that hovers

2939.03 --> 2943.9500000000003
over the water you know about like a

2941.82 --> 2949.17
good six inches you know so you got all

2943.95 --> 2951.2999999999997
that salt debris I'm talking about the

2949.17 --> 2953.85
20-story building that I can see

2951.3 --> 2956.79
completely from eight miles and then

2953.85 --> 2958.83
when I go 27 miles away I can only see

2956.79 --> 2960.45
half of it over the water and I cannot

2958.83 --> 2962.8199999999997
even see the land that is in between

2960.45 --> 2965.2799999999997
myself and they building I just see half

2962.82 --> 2969.21
of the building above no distortion no

2965.28 --> 2975.78
compression straight up obstructed yeah

2969.21 --> 2978.0
did you send that just recently I have I

2975.78 --> 2979.2000000000003
got I got it over here I'll probably do

2978.0 --> 2982.59
my little live stream later done

2979.2 --> 2986.1299999999997
presented yeah yeah well wait for that

2982.59 --> 2987.9900000000002
yeah cuz I don't know was that the 15

2986.13 --> 2990.9500000000003
mile one bet you did or no that was Jeff

2987.99 --> 2990.95
that was Jesse

2993.64 --> 3000.1189999999997
yeah I mean I still gotta go back and

2996.309 --> 3003.2690000000002
repeat this a few times but it's obvious

3000.119 --> 3005.819
that is something going on besides an

3003.269 --> 3007.8289999999997
optical effect that is making me lose

3005.819 --> 3012.269
her bottom of the buildings you know I

3007.829 --> 3014.5190000000002
mean do you can you token elevation for

3012.269 --> 3018.0589999999997
an account you took in things like yeah

3014.519 --> 3020.7889999999998
yes right different elevations

3018.059 --> 3024.48
I see more I go higher I see more I go

3020.789 --> 3027.779
lower I see less I know remember my

3024.48 --> 3040.14
explanation about this no go ahead or

3027.779 --> 3042.69
one optical slant is caused by optical

3040.14 --> 3045.39
slant is caused by a limited viewing

3042.69 --> 3047.9990000000003
angle just like Nathan explains it the

3045.39 --> 3050.1299999999997
result is an optical effect where an

3047.999 --> 3055.109
apparent arising appears and from that

3050.13 --> 3058.4990000000003
point on in a linear fashion a slice out

3055.109 --> 3061.589
of a sight everything within it is

3058.499 --> 3063.8689999999997
obstructed and yet it's linear it's a

3061.589 --> 3065.849
very linear into the distant thing

3063.869 --> 3068.6400000000003
that's why I call it a nautical slant

3065.849 --> 3071.46
and not an optical curl because it's not

3068.64 --> 3074.609
curved doesn't drop cognitive it's a

3071.46 --> 3078.859
slant it's just one point here's the

3074.609 --> 3082.47
apparent horizon and from that point on

3078.859 --> 3084.779
line and how that works is if you raise

3082.47 --> 3087.779
the observer heights the optical slant

3084.779 --> 3092.48
point will migrate forward in a linear

3087.779 --> 3095.64
relation to the observer heights change

3092.48 --> 3098.999
so will migrate into the into the

3095.64 --> 3101.19
distance you can if you study not like

3098.999 --> 3103.049
get into trying to interpret what you're

3101.19 --> 3106.489
seeing but if you just literally look at

3103.049 --> 3109.44
the screen as a drone rays see what is

3106.489 --> 3112.079
literally happening there like a texture

3109.44 --> 3115.049
how is the texture interpreting it in 2d

3112.079 --> 3118.259
how is it changing and you will see that

3115.049 --> 3121.349
this is the case because land point

3118.259 --> 3123.39
migrates and you start as as it migrates

3121.349 --> 3125.309
you will start to see things like

3123.39 --> 3126.64
unfolding out of the horizon you'll

3125.309 --> 3131.26
start to see the texture

3126.64 --> 3134.14
the water like growing's yeah you see it

3131.26 --> 3136.6000000000004
like that but beyond where it all falls

3134.14 --> 3139.92
together in that horizon point there's

3136.6 --> 3143.08
still things visible from that point on

3139.92 --> 3146.38
but okay you'll be partially obstructed

3143.08 --> 3148.75
from the bottom up okay now that

3146.38 --> 3152.29
explanation that you gave me versus is

3148.75 --> 3157.45
just behind the curve about that yeah

3152.29 --> 3160.24
that's very nice just be a girl just be

3157.45 --> 3161.9199999999996
a nickel lovely you know it's like nice

3160.24 --> 3164.89
and easy you don't have to think about

3161.92 --> 3166.4500000000003
it figure it out what actually has

3164.89 --> 3170.17
happened you don't have to study it you

3166.45 --> 3171.6099999999997
just take it take it for granted I go

3170.17 --> 3174.2200000000003
every time I go I try to get this

3171.61 --> 3176.29
flatter through this this little golden

3174.22 --> 3179.5
nugget but I haven't acid when I catch a

3176.29 --> 3181.57
lot of information and this banner of

3179.5 --> 3183.22
refraction and all these optical effects

3181.57 --> 3185.3500000000004
something when it's a really clear day I

3183.22 --> 3188.08
get freakin obstruction do you big-time

3185.35 --> 3189.3399999999997
dude you've been digging through Gold's

3188.08 --> 3192.16
all the time

3189.34 --> 3194.4100000000003
and you just throw it away you don't

3192.16 --> 3196.33
even notice what you're doing I keep I

3194.41 --> 3197.74
will keep taking this footage and I will

3196.33 --> 3204.22
keep presenting it because that's what

3197.74 --> 3205.75
I'm passionate about there'll be

3204.22 --> 3208.24
somebody out there you know who do

3205.75 --> 3213.72
s'more research and you know they'll

3208.24 --> 3216.1899999999996
debunk you and in that sense of feeling

3213.72 --> 3217.8999999999996
yeah and I don't gonna present it as a

3216.19 --> 3220.15
glow prove or flatter prove are gonna

3217.9 --> 3222.1600000000003
resent that this is what I cast this is

3220.15 --> 3225.73
what I write write this interpret it you

3222.16 --> 3227.98
know help me out here you go dude I'll

3225.73 --> 3230.92
do the I'll do the deduction based

3227.98 --> 3232.69
analysis for what you're showing as I

3230.92 --> 3234.4
have done with every single piece of

3232.69 --> 3236.62
footage that you presented on the show

3234.4 --> 3239.35
and I love it and I'm glad I can be part

3236.62 --> 3241.12
of everybody that I can present a little

3239.35 --> 3242.95
piece of footage maybe for somebody it's

3241.12 --> 3245.41
worth noting and for other people is

3242.95 --> 3248.95
awesome for us you know and I appreciate

3245.41 --> 3251.1099999999997
that I like to create this content to

3248.95 --> 3253.8399999999997
figure out this this [ __ ] reality

3251.11 --> 3256.48
will it in I do love that's nice

3253.84 --> 3259.609
well maybe you should get to the actual

3256.48 --> 3262.2
figuring out part instead of just

3259.609 --> 3264.119
moving the cart forward and just

3262.2 --> 3266.5789999999997
accepting know the curve is easier

3264.119 --> 3269.73
because that's just freaking dumb and

3266.579 --> 3271.529
lazy especially after all the best time

3269.73 --> 3274.17
that you've already spent with us it

3271.529 --> 3276.24
can't believe that you're not that this

3274.17 --> 3277.0190000000002
is your default position I can't believe

3276.24 --> 3279.66
it really

3277.019 --> 3283.2589999999996
but I'm the label you know what as I say

3279.66 --> 3285.509
always this is my take a default is a

3283.259 --> 3286.799
flat stationary earth with everything

3285.509 --> 3289.95
we're all being around all that's a

3286.799 --> 3292.109
default now that's a default in the

3289.95 --> 3294.8689999999997
beginning of humanity but we are very

3292.109 --> 3297.269
ahead of on humanity we are many

3294.869 --> 3301.259
generations ahead now it's been figured

3297.269 --> 3303.66
out somehow at the globe cuz the

3301.259 --> 3305.849
ancients were all [ __ ] and a bunch

3303.66 --> 3308.91
of medieval people that had sex with

3305.849 --> 3313.259
their daughters and everybody was stupid

3308.91 --> 3319.17
right yeah so if I what the beginning of

3313.259 --> 3321.839
humanity ancients were absolutely more

3319.17 --> 3324.48
advanced intellectually technologically

3321.839 --> 3327.21
more morally sound they designed their

3324.48 --> 3330.66
technology in a Bandhan in a benevolent

3327.21 --> 3333.69
way not a malevolent way like the modern

3330.66 --> 3336.089
society in which as it increases in

3333.69 --> 3339.18
expense people become more [ __ ] than

3336.089 --> 3341.849
ever more fooled than ever the

3339.18 --> 3343.5
generations now they can be told things

3341.849 --> 3346.619
that they will blindly accept that

3343.5 --> 3348.99
people that had education education

3346.619 --> 3350.849
twenty years ago they look at it and

3348.99 --> 3353.91
they get choked like oh my god they

3350.849 --> 3356.5190000000002
accept this I can't believe that they're

3353.91 --> 3359.359
accepting this yeah so we're not the

3356.519 --> 3362.16
most advanced we're actually regressing

3359.359 --> 3363.99
intellectually culturally on average

3362.16 --> 3368.7889999999998
people are becoming more short-sighted

3363.99 --> 3371.7299999999996
more bored easily distracted all that

3368.789 --> 3373.65
[ __ ] short sighted deluded easily

3371.73 --> 3377.16
accepting [ __ ] that happened that's

3373.65 --> 3379.46
happening and yes because of the way

3377.16 --> 3383.8489999999997
it's designed and this can be stopped

3379.46 --> 3386.069
but we'd have to stop it first and now

3383.849 --> 3387.9300000000003
my journeys gonna be flat earth movement

3386.069 --> 3390.2599999999998
is a part of that and then there are the

3387.93 --> 3394.77
political movements

3390.26 --> 3399.63
yeah it's all the same movement against

3394.77 --> 3402.5099999999998
the regressive society okay now my

3399.63 --> 3405.03
journey is gonna be find this rearrange

3402.51 --> 3406.92
disposal of the Flat Earth and make it

3405.03 --> 3409.71
work a hundred percent I want a picture

3406.92 --> 3412.2000000000003
I want to visualize it and in the same

3409.71 --> 3415.099
bread I want to find the missing links

3412.2 --> 3418.049
on the globe explanations that is

3415.099 --> 3419.6090000000004
scientifically if it's not there I want

3418.049 --> 3421.2
to find this I want to find what's

3419.609 --> 3423.0299999999997
missing in the globe I want to find was

3421.2 --> 3425.64
literally a platter that's for right now

3423.03 --> 3426.599
okay right now I cannot fill all those

3425.64 --> 3429.0
freaking holes

3426.599 --> 3431.4300000000003
I was the homo [ __ ] it's just

3429.0 --> 3436.01
complicated machinations to fill it that

3431.43 --> 3439.14
is all sorry sorry for talking over ya

3436.01 --> 3441.21
but ya talked about it fractal looming

3439.14 --> 3446.0989999999997
so many other ways you just make a

3441.21 --> 3449.04
gravity shield it's there are so many

3446.099 --> 3451.559
new edits that can be done to fix the

3449.04 --> 3453.66
globe [ __ ] but it's not gonna make

3451.559 --> 3455.88
it true because it's just adding more

3453.66 --> 3458.7599999999998
things that are not really there to fix

3455.88 --> 3461.2400000000002
the holes okay and that's what it's

3458.76 --> 3465.96
always been that's what it is it's all

3461.24 --> 3469.02
just fix the holes upon holes you take

3465.96 --> 3470.73
one hole and you put it in front of the

3469.02 --> 3472.2599999999998
other to cover the other hole up and

3470.73 --> 3475.23
then you put another hole in front of

3472.26 --> 3477.3590000000004
that to cover the previous holes and now

3475.23 --> 3479.099
we're staring at holes that suggest that

3477.359 --> 3480.5989999999997
the holes are superficial and then you

3479.099 --> 3482.67
dig into it and you found out it is

3480.599 --> 3484.5
absolutely foundational they have our

3482.67 --> 3487.17
they have the presupposition of our

3484.5 --> 3489.99
that's the presupposition that Venus is

3487.17 --> 3491.88
as big as Earth assuming that it even is

3489.99 --> 3495.0
a globe like Earth is assumed to be a

3491.88 --> 3495.839
globe all that on your claim it's the

3495.0 --> 3498.14
combination

3495.839 --> 3501.15
it's what it's all build on you can

3498.14 --> 3503.1299999999997
trace this you can trace this

3501.15 --> 3505.98
historically you can trace it through

3503.13 --> 3510.54
their formulas through their systems

3505.98 --> 3513.78
that it is this it is all holes upon

3510.54 --> 3516.54
holes upon holes and only the top layer

3513.78 --> 3518.4300000000003
of holes suggests that it may just be

3516.54 --> 3519.08
superficial problem they haven't solved

3518.43 --> 3521.54
yet

3519.08 --> 3526.54
but if you didn't do it water figure out

3521.54 --> 3529.84
it is all one giant gap and

3526.54 --> 3532.61
presupposition pile of unproven garbage

3529.84 --> 3534.6800000000003
let's go to a little basic basic little

3532.61 --> 3536.6600000000003
piece of observation over here in favor

3534.68 --> 3539.0
of the globe how can we explain

3536.66 --> 3541.1299999999997
soundless footage within a straight

3539.0 --> 3547.34
breeze and it shows courage how can we

3541.13 --> 3549.8
explain it it's natural it's a part of

3547.34 --> 3553.4500000000003
optics it's what happens when things are

3549.8 --> 3555.59
too far away over a flat surface

3553.45 --> 3558.89
manipulate a few I can get the same

3555.59 --> 3562.88
foolish it's gonna work with every

3558.89 --> 3566.81
bridge without every straight thing okay

3562.88 --> 3570.1400000000003
reaching into the distance that that

3566.81 --> 3572.2999999999997
sort of thing just happens and it's easy

3570.14 --> 3573.92
to explain Timmy also an observation the

3572.3 --> 3576.38
higher you go the more you see because I

3573.92 --> 3578.81
get the same effect in my footage ELISA

3576.38 --> 3580.73
sees to explain explain that to you the

3578.81 --> 3582.38
optical slant effect the relation of the

3580.73 --> 3586.4900000000002
observer ID with the point where the

3582.38 --> 3588.86
optical slant starts and beyond that the

3586.49 --> 3592.8799999999997
Mirage in zone 2 slice on the site where

3588.86 --> 3596.3900000000003
things are being reflected but what did

3592.88 --> 3598.76
the bottom ten story ten ten floors of

3596.39 --> 3600.8199999999997
the building wind when I see the line of

3598.76 --> 3603.98
the water them safe floors above being

3600.82 --> 3606.44
explained that exactly it is within the

3603.98 --> 3610.3
Mirage in zone so you're seeing a parsed

3606.44 --> 3612.62
off the building itself being reflected

3610.3 --> 3617.2400000000002
through the hole that was not done yet

3612.62 --> 3619.7599999999998
right okay hold on Jose not done yet the

3617.24 --> 3622.7
part of the building will be a

3619.76 --> 3624.3500000000004
reflection of the part above it that is

3622.7 --> 3626.48
within the Mirage engine the actual

3624.35 --> 3628.43
building will be there but you're not

3626.48 --> 3630.77
seeing any of that at all because it is

3628.43 --> 3636.08
in the obstructed zone within that slice

3630.77 --> 3640.07
out of sight and you know the more I see

3636.08 --> 3641.96
the mirror that is on top of that slice

3640.07 --> 3643.28
other side it was no mirror I know about

3641.96 --> 3645.35
mirror I mean that's what I've been

3643.28 --> 3647.0
catching almost every day and when I see

3645.35 --> 3649.22
a clear day I know a clear day that was

3647.0 --> 3650.87
a clear day and I can see the top ten

3649.22 --> 3652.0389999999998
floors of the building I don't see the

3650.87 --> 3654.749
bottom same floor there

3652.039 --> 3657.9
90% me religious instead of just talking

3654.749 --> 3659.91
about that constantly all right let me

3657.9 --> 3661.619
let me post a little gift I did over

3659.91 --> 3663.749
here in the in the master bi got better

3661.619 --> 3665.6400000000003
but I did a little give our gonna posted

3663.749 --> 3669.23
in the in the Skype shot

3665.64 --> 3669.23
give me one in the gotta find it

3697.78 --> 3700.3500000000004
okay

3705.77 --> 3713.93
by the ways sidekicks 6 Warrior joint

3710.18 --> 3720.56
right what's up psychics you know what

3713.93 --> 3721.97
is tre good to hear everybody coming in

3720.56 --> 3724.82
hold what's up I win

3721.97 --> 3727.9399999999996
they are when I heard you got your your

3724.82 --> 3731.06
super chat approved Congrats buddy I did

3727.94 --> 3733.52
is that true no okay that was a rule

3731.06 --> 3737.599
yeah no not yet

3733.52 --> 3745.06
if this guy was just able to I see it

3737.599 --> 3749.96
hold on no I was simply able to ask to

3745.06 --> 3752.869
apply or submitted a submit submit one

3749.96 --> 3755.7400000000002
of your monetization requests I'll take

3752.869 --> 3758.32
a look right now where I'm

3755.74 --> 3760.4199999999996
and it's probably not gonna be approved

3758.32 --> 3762.6000000000004
that they say it takes like a month or

3760.42 --> 3762.6
so

3762.69 --> 3765.63
now it's going to take three years once

3764.4 --> 3770.55
you get to prove that it's three years

3765.63 --> 3773.04
to implement em well I'm not gonna wake

3770.55 --> 3777.36
up that long because I have other things

3773.04 --> 3780.05
to do as well so but I'll still be doing

3777.36 --> 3780.05
my YouTube

3780.08 --> 3788.34
I'm just got there after all these years

3784.02 --> 3793.13
complaining about it no a super chat has

3788.34 --> 3795.7200000000003
not been enabled yet so still pending

3793.13 --> 3797.85
what has it been like approved they just

3795.72 --> 3801.18
better know it's still pending I just

3797.85 --> 3802.71
told you all right

3801.18 --> 3804.6499999999996
well so now people were saying that it

3802.71 --> 3805.92
was approved but it just hasn't been

3804.65 --> 3809.81
launched

3805.92 --> 3811.9500000000003
yeah or whatever no proof but not not

3809.81 --> 3816.08
initiated I don't know who's saying that

3811.95 --> 3820.1099999999997
but it's not approved it's still pending

3816.08 --> 3822.42
sure thousand subscribers right Arwen if

3820.11 --> 3824.46
you can that's when you can yeah you

3822.42 --> 3827.2200000000003
could not okay let's find your attorney

3824.46 --> 3830.66
so your 1020 it looks like I know yeah

3827.22 --> 3830.66
it's actually right jobs

3838.32 --> 3840.9700000000003
we're Jose go is he looking for

3840.55 --> 3844.0600000000004
something

3840.97 --> 3846.91
oh I'm here I posted a little gift I did

3844.06 --> 3848.59
blink paste I did in my way out on day

3846.91 --> 3852.25
I'm gonna get to it

3848.59 --> 3857.61
sorry it's just we've been going for

3852.25 --> 3860.17
over an hour hour even so let's see the

3857.61 --> 3862.6
quality is really shitty Jose

3860.17 --> 3863.9500000000003
yeah it's shitty I got better footage

3862.6 --> 3886.7799999999997
there is enough foolish I just took a

3863.95 --> 3888.96
screenshot it looks messy but here you

3886.78 --> 3888.96
go

3891.9 --> 3895.009
oh goody

3897.19 --> 3906.46
so what is the issue here this little

3904.63 --> 3908.26
blue light house you don't gonna see it

3906.46 --> 3910.63
because it's a parallax issue I'm

3908.26 --> 3913.78
slightly to the right so the lighthouse

3910.63 --> 3915.2200000000003
is out of the view like from this

3913.78 --> 3917.4700000000003
observation when you can see the

3915.22 --> 3919.48
lighthouse and a building the lighthouse

3917.47 --> 3920.0789999999997
from my point of view is five and a half

3919.48 --> 3922.48
miles

3920.079 --> 3924.76
the building is eight and a half miles

3922.48 --> 3927.16
so just because of the angle they look

3924.76 --> 3929.65
side-by-side now in the twenty seven

3927.16 --> 3930.91
miles away I only can see the building

3929.65 --> 3932.98
the lighthouse is out of the view

3930.91 --> 3935.5499999999997
there's a little piece of land that is

3932.98 --> 3938.829
blocking me a little bit on the building

3935.55 --> 3941.7400000000002
unless you wanna say the compression

3938.829 --> 3943.69
zone on all the bottom floor of the

3941.74 --> 3946.2099999999996
building plus the land underneath is

3943.69 --> 3949.51
hidden behind this little piece of land

3946.21 --> 3951.369
that is blocking it but yeah I can go to

3949.51 --> 3953.71
a different angle and I can just see the

3951.369 --> 3957.1600000000003
top of the building no land in there

3953.71 --> 3959.319
because the land goes a few hundred more

3957.16 --> 3961.359
feet to the right and he stopped and I

3959.319 --> 3963.31
was able to get to the other side and it

3961.359 --> 3965.8289999999997
was just the building seat that he saw

3963.31 --> 3968.98
the building sitting in the water okay

3965.829 --> 3971.29
and it's not mirrored it doesn't

3968.98 --> 3973.329
necessarily have to be mirrored okay

3971.29 --> 3975.849
mirroring is only the most common

3973.329 --> 3979.75
occurrence but sometimes it compresses

3975.849 --> 3983.02
sometimes it just cuts off but the issue

3979.75 --> 3987.4
is if that part is still in the

3983.02 --> 3989.2599999999998
obstructed zone and when I'm 27 at this

3987.4 --> 3991.03
when when I see just the top of the

3989.26 --> 3992.8
building I'm like 20 foot above the

3991.03 --> 3994.96
water it's not that I'm really close the

3992.8 --> 3999.569
water and the waves are blocking it it's

3994.96 --> 3999.569
not I'm really high observer observer hi

4002.87 --> 4008.37
okay this is the thing I see interesting

4006.3 --> 4011.01
because I will continue doing

4008.37 --> 4014.16
observations posting them and and and

4011.01 --> 4016.86
question myself can I explain this on a

4014.16 --> 4018.0
flat earth I really cannot I mean I can

4016.86 --> 4019.98
I'm sorry

4018.0 --> 4021.54
may call them sorry but you know I'm

4019.98 --> 4029.73
sorry that you have so much trouble

4021.54 --> 4032.16
doing that I just did it so just explain

4029.73 --> 4034.23
it exactly the optical slant obstruction

4032.16 --> 4035.8199999999997
zone in this case it's not reflected it

4034.23 --> 4039.0
seems to just be cut off

4035.82 --> 4043.6800000000003
it's one of the weirder kind of effects

4039.0 --> 4045.72
that comes forth and I will continue

4043.68 --> 4047.3999999999996
being myself I will continue coming to

4045.72 --> 4049.1099999999997
there hang out who you hang out if you

4047.4 --> 4050.4900000000002
let me in I don't gonna talk about this

4049.11 --> 4053.7000000000003
[ __ ] anymore just want to let it out

4050.49 --> 4057.0299999999997
this is my this is my take now unless

4053.7 --> 4058.98
the conversation you know you know it's

4057.03 --> 4060.8100000000004
mandatory to talk about it but I don't

4058.98 --> 4062.88
talk about this I mean I got a lot of

4060.81 --> 4064.44
things to talk about but besides this

4062.88 --> 4066.87
I'll love to talk about the flattered

4064.44 --> 4068.76
but I don't want to go into belief

4066.87 --> 4074.16
versus reality because it's all a

4068.76 --> 4077.5200000000004
believer no that's not but yeah you're

4074.16 --> 4080.2799999999997
welcome to try to utter that and suggest

4077.52 --> 4083.07
that and I will Ram it down just like

4080.28 --> 4085.4100000000003
with any baller not gonna distinguish

4083.07 --> 4087.57
because you got great footage or

4085.41 --> 4090.44
whatever you know if you're gonna talk

4087.57 --> 4094.7000000000003
[ __ ] then I will correct you on it

4090.44 --> 4094.7000000000003
so that's the rules

4094.74 --> 4098.19
I wish I was being paid by somebody

4096.84 --> 4099.96
because I'm broke

4098.19 --> 4102.929999999999
eating potatoes because I got no money

4099.96 --> 4105.75
for me I got no money for rent broke

4102.93 --> 4107.7300000000005
like a [ __ ] and I hope somebody

4105.75 --> 4110.58
got to me and pay me something because

4107.73 --> 4112.049999999999
you got [ __ ] that's why I'm speaking out

4110.58 --> 4114.03
because I'm [ __ ] sick and tired of

4112.05 --> 4116.37
this [ __ ] and I just wanna continue

4114.03 --> 4117.719999999999
being myself the same broadcast I was in

4116.37 --> 4119.849999999999
the beginning the same broke a sound

4117.72 --> 4124.650000000001
right now thank you well if you want

4119.85 --> 4127.490000000001
money help from people then you gotta be

4124.65 --> 4131.009999999999
loyal and if you're gonna do switcheroos

4127.49 --> 4133.71
nowhere for no particularly good or well

4131.01 --> 4135.84
thought out reason then yeah it's gonna

4133.71 --> 4140.46
be a lot of trouble you're gonna be at

4135.84 --> 4142.2300000000005
the people's mercy because after all

4140.46 --> 4144.75
this I certainly don't want to

4142.23 --> 4147.209999999999
financially support you it sounds really

4144.75 --> 4147.75
harsh of me to say but that's how I feel

4147.21 --> 4150.51
about it

4147.75 --> 4152.43
although yeah I still do damn well I

4150.51 --> 4154.26
appreciate your footage but the sound

4152.43 --> 4156.9800000000005
that's just something wrong there man

4154.26 --> 4156.9800000000005
it's just

4160.03 --> 4168.19
I don't know it you gotta be consistent

4163.15 --> 4171.969999999999
you gotta be logical and you gotta

4168.19 --> 4174.46
listen also ya something might not make

4171.97 --> 4175.240000000001
sense you gotta see why it doesn't make

4174.46 --> 4177.37
any sense

4175.24 --> 4180.91
or are you listening I live are you are

4177.37 --> 4185.37
you hearing it can you repeat it can you

4180.91 --> 4188.41
explain something with that explanation

4185.37 --> 4190.51
can I learn learn learn an explanation

4188.41 --> 4192.22
and regulate it that's what they bollard

4190.51 --> 4194.110000000001
that's what they ball did to me made me

4192.22 --> 4195.06
memorize [ __ ] and regurgitate it back I

4194.11 --> 4199.299999999999
don't want to do that

4195.06 --> 4202.330000000001
can I you can test it please if you can

4199.3 --> 4204.1
find a similar type of sorry I'll let

4202.33 --> 4209.59
you talk after this but if you can find

4204.1 --> 4211.33
a mistake where I am secretly actually

4209.59 --> 4214.0
allowing some kind of calculation

4211.33 --> 4215.8
pattern with an autograph you instead of

4214.0 --> 4218.17
perspective like the ball ership with

4215.8 --> 4220.99
the curvature calculation hey if you can

4218.17 --> 4223.9
find a flaw a cornerstone a piece of

4220.99 --> 4226.12
fraud a machination in mine concept that

4223.9 --> 4228.58
I explain every time about the optical

4226.12 --> 4230.86
slant any relation with the observer ID

4228.58 --> 4233.82
and everything how it works if you can

4230.86 --> 4236.86
find a machination in that by all means

4233.82 --> 4238.21
show it to me show it to me where I am

4236.86 --> 4242.71
misleading people

4238.21 --> 4245.8
okay because I didn't do that

4242.71 --> 4248.62
I'm just figuring it out as I go and I'm

4245.8 --> 4250.66
learning more and more as to what is

4248.62 --> 4257.5599999999995
happening there and I'm building the

4250.66 --> 4261.22
formula right there in plain sight okay

4257.56 --> 4264.52
um hey guys don't wanna be like somewhat

4261.22 --> 4267.27
of a wedge but in all honesty and this

4264.52 --> 4269.71
and this is pretty much it sounds like

4267.27 --> 4271.6900000000005
what leads to is the language that we're

4269.71 --> 4273.31
pretty much getting involved and we're

4271.69 --> 4274.66
probably deflecting off into the

4273.31 --> 4276.55
mainstream of what we're trying to do

4274.66 --> 4279.01
and first and foremost I want to

4276.55 --> 4280.06
indicate that here that in the panel all

4279.01 --> 4283.21
of us have been lied to

4280.06 --> 4284.830000000001
you've been deceived sorry about that

4283.21 --> 4287.17
I'm just being honest with you and I

4284.83 --> 4290.05
have been in that in that situation so

4287.17 --> 4292.3
my question to both of you and this is

4290.05 --> 4293.53
very simple that I'm gonna be asking

4292.3 --> 4295.84
both of you

4293.53 --> 4300.3099999999995
and that you guys have proof of the ball

4295.84 --> 4302.92
earth or the Flat Earth reality yes you

4300.31 --> 4306.13
are what's up fellas

4302.92 --> 4307.93
it's psychics was good seeing you bro so

4306.13 --> 4309.04
I need proof if that's the case if we're

4307.93 --> 4310.63
talking about language

4309.04 --> 4312.88
you guys have proof of the ball earth

4310.63 --> 4317.9800000000005
and the Flat Earth as far as our total

4312.88 --> 4319.78
existence the based on the shape right

4317.98 --> 4322.87
well I'm working on it

4319.78 --> 4324.82
I've conceptualized it it's just yeah

4322.87 --> 4328.48
the only thing that I use is a

4324.82 --> 4331.57
presupposition of L that's all it's the

4328.48 --> 4335.379999999999
only presupposition that I don't need to

4331.57 --> 4336.94
prove to found it completely in reality

4335.38 --> 4339.58
somehow and that's the most difficult

4336.94 --> 4343.66
part also the most difficult part to

4339.58 --> 4345.97
imagine for any personality I mean up

4343.66 --> 4347.92
for myself for right now I'm just gonna

4345.97 --> 4350.41
I just want to bring it hopefully I can

4347.92 --> 4353.37
bring down to a meeting as for myself

4350.41 --> 4356.74
I've been through two things way before

4353.37 --> 4359.17
way before flatter I've been in ribbon

4356.74 --> 4360.88
with it with the globe I've had all

4359.17 --> 4362.5
these people and you know that I thought

4360.88 --> 4364.99
I thought to be true you know and then

4362.5 --> 4368.05
help me along the way before even 24 and

4364.99 --> 4369.849999999999
now since this new truth that came in it

4368.05 --> 4372.1900000000005
looks like it will train faster being

4369.85 --> 4375.490000000001
shrimp size has been size has been taken

4372.19 --> 4377.08
based on based on the shape but then my

4375.49 --> 4378.67
own but the whole thing when I looked at

4377.08 --> 4380.23
is that world the same we're still

4378.67 --> 4383.47
looking for truth we've been lied to and

4380.23 --> 4386.62
we're still playing this game now it

4383.47 --> 4389.2300000000005
only honesty not only that we're seeing

4386.62 --> 4391.15
people out there in France also

4389.23 --> 4393.549999999999
picketing all that and yet we're still

4391.15 --> 4396.67
we're still seem to be divided based on

4393.55 --> 4398.95
the shape divided in France divided it

4396.67 --> 4402.58
and in the work divided and politicians

4398.95 --> 4406.15
everything is divided now if that is the

4402.58 --> 4407.59
case is in this Codel reality what do we

4406.15 --> 4409.509999999999
need to adjourn I mean what do we need

4407.59 --> 4411.7
to see for this type of things that

4409.51 --> 4415.54
we're all based on this on this same

4411.7 --> 4417.5199999999995
line so that's why I had to ask you for

4415.54 --> 4419.14
those questions if we both have got

4417.52 --> 4421.4800000000005
proof of the earth if it's not the earth

4419.14 --> 4424.27
and we need to address what is our

4421.48 --> 4425.7699999999995
reality so that means if you're if

4424.27 --> 4427.119000000001
you're honest with yourself and if

4425.77 --> 4429.369000000001
you're looking now

4427.119 --> 4431.98
based on the natural physics here just

4429.369 --> 4435.79
eyes without evil cameras if you see an

4431.98 --> 4436.839999999999
arc if you see a declination whatever

4435.79 --> 4439.36
that's fine

4436.84 --> 4442.09
I mean then if it receives uni a

4439.36 --> 4443.44
curvature in your reality then that's

4442.09 --> 4444.82
great I'm not gonna convince you

4443.44 --> 4447.159
otherwise because you are the best

4444.82 --> 4449.409
person to create your own belief your

4447.159 --> 4451.869
model your own concept but as far as

4449.409 --> 4453.699
well for me to be honest with you I see

4451.869 --> 4455.589999999999
things in plain sight and I'm still

4453.699 --> 4459.3099999999995
looking for the ideas that for the shape

4455.59 --> 4462.31
the both of you are addressing so as far

4459.31 --> 4465.070000000001
as optical slants illusions compressions

4462.31 --> 4466.63
all those definitions will construct us

4465.07 --> 4468.489
to a point where we're at at this

4466.63 --> 4471.099
reality right now that we're all being

4468.489 --> 4475.089999999999
like everything is a friggin lie

4471.099 --> 4476.83
everything all right so I couldn't agree

4475.09 --> 4484.929
anymore man I couldn't agree more

4476.83 --> 4486.909
thank you I appreciate it

4484.929 --> 4489.67
and if there's no sides to take there's

4486.909 --> 4491.86
there's us looking for truth and some of

4489.67 --> 4494.77
us got a different take on it I probably

4491.86 --> 4496.509999999999
you probably take me like holy [ __ ] he's

4494.77 --> 4498.400000000001
changed from the night of the morning

4496.51 --> 4500.9800000000005
and yes I did from one day to another I

4498.4 --> 4502.598999999999
changed my mentality a little bit I

4500.98 --> 4504.699
tweet that I kind of showing my true

4502.599 --> 4507.13
colors now but it's not that I've been

4504.699 --> 4509.5
hiding it I've been held in it back is

4507.13 --> 4516.07
the difference you know I want to speak

4509.5 --> 4518.26
up more honestly now this is me I'm okay

4516.07 --> 4520.869
with mic I'm okay that if you know if

4518.26 --> 4523.659000000001
you think the turtle is a good it's a

4520.869 --> 4526.509999999999
good shape that's great but I'm just

4523.659 --> 4528.67
kidding man but we can keep things plain

4526.51 --> 4531.099
and simple with our discussions we are

4528.67 --> 4533.409
actually doing demolition work based on

4531.099 --> 4535.719
the fake reality and this just focus on

4533.409 --> 4537.67
the fake reality that we are in here and

4535.719 --> 4539.949
if we're gonna get distracted based on

4537.67 --> 4542.349
the language that got us all in the

4539.949 --> 4545.08
first place to create this panel we need

4542.349 --> 4546.9400000000005
to address things that what's also you

4545.08 --> 4548.739
know deflecting us you know that's

4546.94 --> 4552.098999999999
that's all and that's why I wanted to

4548.739 --> 4554.29
dressed you guys thank you well have I

4552.099 --> 4556.360000000001
done personally I have taken a lot of

4554.29 --> 4558.46
foolish and I catch a lot of optical

4556.36 --> 4560.999
phenomena is very interesting to explain

4558.46 --> 4563.199
but then there's some this other

4560.999 --> 4564.849
phenomenas that I cast that I cannot

4563.199 --> 4565.69
explain in a flower like this big-ass

4564.849 --> 4567.849
obstructions

4565.69 --> 4569.138999999999
for example sawdust why is just

4567.849 --> 4570.729
scratching my head I'm tired of

4569.139 --> 4573.36
scratching my head I'm loose I already

4570.729 --> 4575.7390000000005
lost my hair so not anymore I say is

4573.36 --> 4578.799999999999
behind the [ __ ] bendy water that we

4575.739 --> 4581.018999999999
all looking for and and that's it is you

4578.8 --> 4584.55
know is what I say and and if you don't

4581.019 --> 4584.55
take it don't take it you don't have you

4590.229 --> 4594.570000000001
so a lot of trolls out here

4598.699 --> 4603.86
yeah hey maybe you might be right you

4601.01 --> 4605.179
know because you know most of us you

4603.86 --> 4608.12
know flat believers they don't believe

4605.179 --> 4611.33
in a ball but even it even being flat

4608.12 --> 4613.67
you know it might be you know way bigger

4611.33 --> 4616.79
than we think it is but it might not be

4613.67 --> 4618.679
visually but you know just you had to

4616.79 --> 4623.54
put it in that perspective you know you

4618.679 --> 4626.2390000000005
know it's just definitely as for right

4623.54 --> 4628.28
now there's a there's a moral I can

4626.239 --> 4630.919999999999
picture is the spinning ball that that I

4628.28 --> 4633.38
was born into we were all born into I

4630.92 --> 4634.91
have been presented with alternative an

4633.38 --> 4637.400000000001
alternative explanation for everything

4634.91 --> 4641.03
and it's beautiful I love it because I

4637.4 --> 4643.849999999999
love questioning now wanna maybe take

4641.03 --> 4646.28
the easier route now today to starting

4643.85 --> 4648.4400000000005
today as yeah I'm gonna take it as a

4646.28 --> 4649.969
globe but I'm gonna entertain everything

4648.44 --> 4651.98
because I know now there are

4649.969 --> 4654.14
alternatives and I did not just gonna

4651.98 --> 4656.989
kicking me to the curb and ignore them

4654.14 --> 4659.33
there are alternatives and when I catch

4656.989 --> 4661.19
this food is that I'm looking for when I

4659.33 --> 4663.5
see something when I find this article

4661.19 --> 4665.0
that I'm looking for that it's flat when

4663.5 --> 4668.48
I picture it in my mind the whole

4665.0 --> 4671.239
picture then Dana I will I will make a

4668.48 --> 4674.69
decision is my journey is my trip you

4671.239 --> 4676.009999999999
know I am loving it broad yeah that's

4674.69 --> 4677.389999999999
fine just keep doing more and more

4676.01 --> 4679.280000000001
research that's what you're here for

4677.39 --> 4682.04
that's what we're all here for you know

4679.28 --> 4684.67
just to learn you know what this why

4682.04 --> 4684.67
we're on this earth

4689.37 --> 4696.57
good stuff good shower with the children

4691.82 --> 4698.69
yeah it's okay that I'd like I'd love to

4696.57 --> 4702.57
just slap you in the face sir more

4698.69 --> 4704.639999999999
babies superficial nonsense that drivel

4702.57 --> 4708.33
and basic stuff that we've all talked

4704.64 --> 4710.22
about two years ago because after all

4708.33 --> 4718.13
this [ __ ] I'm not in too good a mood and

4710.22 --> 4721.56
the trolls are just so you know what

4718.13 --> 4725.150000000001
screw you guys not the panel I'm gonna

4721.56 --> 4732.77
make Karen be a moderator and Karen beat

4725.15 --> 4732.7699999999995
you go and do what you do best I care oh

4734.66 --> 4741.75
wow okay I got a question

4739.11 --> 4743.46
so this son I don't know what the Sun is

4741.75 --> 4745.11
I don't know what it's made of

4743.46 --> 4746.97
I don't know how far it is I don't know

4745.11 --> 4749.88
how it behaves it's a light based

4746.97 --> 4752.31
phenomena now how does he work in a

4749.88 --> 4754.08
flutter Darwin go in a ball is just

4752.31 --> 4755.9400000000005
going behind the horizon either they are

4754.08 --> 4758.55
this spinning under Sun is a big-ass

4755.94 --> 4760.5599999999995
ball of hydrogen or whatever do you call

4758.55 --> 4760.9800000000005
it hand and it works because it's very

4760.56 --> 4764.900000000001
far away

4760.98 --> 4764.9
in a Florida now go

4772.77 --> 4779.530000000001
yeah I think I'd love to talk some more

4777.88 --> 4780.22
but just didn't that chad is out of

4779.53 --> 4781.719999999999
control

4780.22 --> 4788.89
well maybe with care and B that's going

4781.72 --> 4791.2300000000005
to be over and out yeah but you don't

4788.89 --> 4793.81
have to suck up to me polite ballers you

4791.23 --> 4796.2699999999995
don't need to do that just just don't

4793.81 --> 4798.43
get disgusting and don't start some kind

4796.27 --> 4803.55
of annoying bullying routine [ __ ]

4798.43 --> 4808.030000000001
because it just sucks okay that sucks

4803.55 --> 4811.92
all right so I want to continue this I

4808.03 --> 4811.92
don't have any good reason to stop

4815.1 --> 4820.6
actually gotta go hey I appreciate the

4818.2 --> 4821.95
time Marwan yeah I gotta go out here

4820.6 --> 4825.04
thank you very much I'm sorry everybody

4821.95 --> 4828.37
if I let you down but whatever you know

4825.04 --> 4830.35
I'm gonna continue this is my nume are

4828.37 --> 4833.41
we're gonna continue fire trying to find

4830.35 --> 4838.47
this flower group we might be 900 and I

4833.41 --> 4838.47
will present everything I pass we'll

4840.42 --> 4845.4400000000005
enjoy your journey man I appreciate it

4843.82 --> 4847.03
I'll see you later maybe maybe just

4845.44 --> 4852.96
maybe I do a little ice cream later

4847.03 --> 4852.96
appreciate a guy thank you buddy yep

4853.65 --> 4859.12
all right so let me respond to that it's

4857.38 --> 4860.83
very interesting yeah it's gonna keep

4859.12 --> 4864.37
him looking for that flat earth proof

4860.83 --> 4867.18
well yeah yeah that's okay hold on if he

4864.37 --> 4869.59
loves doing that well good luck because

4867.18 --> 4871.12
this way he's never gonna find it

4869.59 --> 4874.360000000001
because he doesn't really have to look

4871.12 --> 4877.42
that far so right he got such a huge

4874.36 --> 4879.4
library of evidence right there on his

4877.42 --> 4881.53
computer and he's just not seeing it

4879.4 --> 4884.49
apparently so yeah this way he's

4881.53 --> 4887.17
literally he can literally go on forever

4884.49 --> 4889.179999999999
because he's not looking he's looking

4887.17 --> 4889.8
with his eyes closed so good luck with

4889.18 --> 4892.240000000001
that

4889.8 --> 4894.64
don't worry are when I have a baller

4892.24 --> 4897.709
who's been around for years or anyways

4894.64 --> 4900.26
and he he was honest with me

4897.709 --> 4902.84
and he's a pilot and he's got a chopper

4900.26 --> 4905.030000000001
and actually Ashley looking for the

4902.84 --> 4907.76
curve so he's the least honest for that

4905.03 --> 4909.829
and he does like the ball so they got

4907.76 --> 4912.110000000001
one sits I don't like the ball to be

4909.829 --> 4916.369
real though I love the science fiction

4912.11 --> 4921.018999999999
but I just don't like to imagine lies

4916.369 --> 4923.389
being reality that is all enrolled in

4921.019 --> 4926.320000000001
your fantasy anything can be real but if

4923.389 --> 4929.2390000000005
you can distinguish fantasy from reality

4926.32 --> 4932.239
then you will lose your mind you will be

4929.239 --> 4934.098999999999
derailed what did what that's how we can

4932.239 --> 4936.678999999999
differentiate ourselves it's more

4934.099 --> 4938.689
critical thinking but for example we

4936.679 --> 4942.459
have people who have reality that's put

4938.689 --> 4945.7390000000005
into a paper so we have 93 million miles

4942.459 --> 4948.679
93 million miles you know a mile away

4945.739 --> 4950.178999999999
have might not be no fun so for example

4948.679 --> 4951.8
the equation lines are knowing two

4950.179 --> 4953.929
million miles we keep a because it's

4951.8 --> 4956.63
fast very easily but if you tell them

4953.929 --> 4958.969
all if this is a thousand miles out you

4956.63 --> 4960.9490000000005
know that's the actual critical thinking

4958.969 --> 4962.78
that's the mind exercise they're not

4960.949 --> 4964.969
thinking 93 million miles they're

4962.78 --> 4968.329
thinking about a paper that they could

4964.969 --> 4971.449
add to subtract and that is that is very

4968.329 --> 4973.099
it's very easy it's very subtle but it's

4971.449 --> 4974.808999999999
psychological and that's what's keeping

4973.099 --> 4980.119000000001
them into that we out and it's in that

4974.809 --> 4983.059
paper so I mean that's why proof in the

4980.119 --> 4986.539
pudding if it is gonna be 93 miles then

4983.059 --> 4988.01
wow yeah I mean is are you really being

4986.539 --> 4991.459
lied to based on what you're really

4988.01 --> 4991.999
looking at now and also if you're

4991.459 --> 4995.179
spinning

4991.999 --> 4998.63
are you really using your body sensors

4995.179 --> 5001.9890000000005
you feel it are you gonna use that's

4998.63 --> 5004.809
even said it's all relative this is the

5001.989 --> 5007.509999999999
baseline no it's not so easy can you

5004.809 --> 5010.84
feel it now can I see it no not really

5007.51 --> 5013.689
you have to be somewhere else then right

5010.84 --> 5014.92
now to be able to it's like oh yeah you

5013.689 --> 5015.909000000001
gotta go in a plane then you're gonna

5014.92 --> 5017.65
play I didn't see it

5015.909 --> 5021.429
well I maybe you gotta go in a spaceship

5017.65 --> 5023.619
oh okay you know but I can't go there

5021.429 --> 5027.13
well just ask an astronaut they've been

5023.619 --> 5028.839999999999
there it's always just know you didn't

5027.13 --> 5030.11
really prove it you have to trust

5028.84 --> 5033.68
something that you

5030.11 --> 5035.54
just imagine it to be true well that's

5033.68 --> 5036.9800000000005
kind of motivated Darwin I mean

5035.54 --> 5038.9
insistent I just thought if I'm laying

5036.98 --> 5040.37
in bed oh I'm standing if I feel like

5038.9 --> 5042.41
I'm spinning the amounts of the

5040.37 --> 5043.76
equations that's on the paper I'm not

5042.41 --> 5046.16
I'm just gonna be honest with you with

5043.76 --> 5048.38
God I mean other than that other than

5046.16 --> 5049.94
what's of the presupposed what's gonna

5048.38 --> 5052.28
happen just the spin of the earth I

5049.94 --> 5054.049999999999
could imagine that in the constant but

5052.28 --> 5056.389999999999
I'm not gonna say that what I'm saying

5054.05 --> 5059.54
to you honestly I do not feel like I'm

5056.39 --> 5062.51
spinning so I don't need a mat I don't

5059.54 --> 5065.9
need a smudge just just to create this

5062.51 --> 5068.63
paper belief into this reality I'm sorry

5065.9 --> 5071.24
the globe doesn't work on my reality the

5068.63 --> 5074.03
directions doesn't work the maps aren't

5071.24 --> 5075.34
are completely off I'm being like I'm

5074.03 --> 5078.62
being displeased

5075.34 --> 5080.99
I'm paying for like energy systems based

5078.62 --> 5083.45
on crap the system that supported this

5080.99 --> 5086.48
ball method so that's it that's all

5083.45 --> 5088.5199999999995
stitched it's all stitched and that's

5086.48 --> 5091.04
and that's what it is and if everything

5088.52 --> 5093.68
is the lie even their selling of the

5091.04 --> 5095.54
ball is the life so if it's a life to

5093.68 --> 5098.990000000001
line em but I can't help it right all

5095.54 --> 5101.87
are being deceived that's right you're

5098.99 --> 5104.929999999999
absolutely right it is a giant mega

5101.87 --> 5109.01
structure of lies a compartmentalized

5104.93 --> 5114.67
lies on every position suggesting they a

5109.01 --> 5118.37
unified truth it is the embodiment of

5114.67 --> 5120.89
Lucifer of the alternate truth the

5118.37 --> 5124.7
alternate truth structure it is a fake

5120.89 --> 5127.610000000001
truth all of it sure and the lies and

5124.7 --> 5129.83
the belief right and if we want to

5127.61 --> 5132.98
believe it all you have to do is reject

5129.83 --> 5135.71
reality and flip 180 degrees with

5132.98 --> 5138.23
everything all the internal processes

5135.71 --> 5141.2300000000005
everything and then suddenly it makes

5138.23 --> 5143.089999999999
sense again and you can just talk to a

5141.23 --> 5144.889999999999
lot of people that now suddenly make

5143.09 --> 5147.05
sense again and you feel this oh yeah we

5144.89 --> 5148.9400000000005
can we believe the same thing this is

5147.05 --> 5151.1
nice you feel this camaraderie with all

5148.94 --> 5151.549999999999
these delusional people out there it's

5151.1 --> 5154.58
lovely

5151.55 --> 5156.319
such a relief finally you can just act

5154.58 --> 5161.699
like everything

5156.319 --> 5164.4890000000005
again have to worry your tiny little

5161.699 --> 5167.308999999999
heart that you have to carry all that

5164.489 --> 5170.398999999999
responsibility of real knowledge anymore

5167.309 --> 5174.779
it's lovely I tried that doesn't work

5170.399 --> 5175.859
just makes you insane I know I didn't

5174.779 --> 5177.899
want to get my stuff a little bit

5175.859 --> 5180.089
elevated I mean I usually like to keep

5177.899 --> 5182.519
myself level but you know I just don't

5180.089 --> 5184.829
like when I rant I don't stop and I see

5182.519 --> 5186.779
a lot of things that you know I like it

5184.829 --> 5190.3189999999995
when I Drive on the Parkway I could see

5186.779 --> 5192.299000000001
five five cop cars rolling yeah you know

5190.319 --> 5193.7390000000005
their tone because there's everything is

5192.299 --> 5196.889
a presupposition for you guys to

5193.739 --> 5198.388999999999
actually yes based on the belief you're

5196.889 --> 5200.369
going you're pulling over because you

5198.389 --> 5201.659000000001
think it's an emergency but they're

5200.369 --> 5205.308999999999
pulling you over because they're calling

5201.659 --> 5208.3189999999995
you and they're being lied to as well so

5205.309 --> 5210.119000000001
they're bored but they're bored when

5208.319 --> 5212.969
you're no longer seeking for truth and

5210.119 --> 5214.799
opposing the entire world basically in

5212.969 --> 5216.779
this yeah you're certainly part of the

5214.799 --> 5218.459
system and they don't give a [ __ ] about

5216.779 --> 5221.849
you so it's just like yeah do whatever

5218.459 --> 5225.809
make it so they start doing something on

5221.849 --> 5228.629
the same level correctly energy level so

5225.809 --> 5232.1990000000005
they start rolling they have their house

5228.629 --> 5236.189
cleaning they know they turn to the dark

5232.199 --> 5239.188999999999
side with their power with that need to

5236.189 --> 5240.689
wield that power sure it's that paper

5239.189 --> 5242.309
they're gonna pull out everything

5240.689 --> 5244.619000000001
they're gonna add up those mats and

5242.309 --> 5249.629
everything that that's whatever that you

5244.619 --> 5251.518999999999
cause a fish which is fish no God what

5249.629 --> 5252.5689999999995
cause there is no cause there you've

5251.519 --> 5255.149
been getting pulled over a

5252.569 --> 5260.249000000001
presupposition of something there is no

5255.149 --> 5261.749000000001
cause there's no causation it's the same

5260.249 --> 5263.519
thing in the same thing in the legal

5261.749 --> 5265.559
fiction you are getting screwed there

5263.519 --> 5267.479
too so if we're telling you you getting

5265.559 --> 5268.589
screwed on the sine side I'm telling

5267.479 --> 5271.099
you're getting screwed on the legal side

5268.589 --> 5271.099
as well

5271.42 --> 5276.46
I don't have I'm sorry I'm just getting

5274.75 --> 5277.75
I don't want to escalate any more night

5276.46 --> 5280.4800000000005
I don't want to sleep the whole for the

5277.75 --> 5282.31
chat as well so escalating oh yeah I

5280.48 --> 5284.53
already feel it and I have a feeling I'm

5282.31 --> 5286.450000000001
just gonna charge everybody but I'm

5284.53 --> 5288.429999999999
sorry I'm gonna no no go ahead

5286.45 --> 5291.58
we're all triggered here anyway I'm

5288.43 --> 5295.360000000001
curious as to what you have to say well

5291.58 --> 5297.4
if you think well I I'm kind of out of

5295.36 --> 5299.29
it right now because it's just because

5297.4 --> 5302.679999999999
I'm triggered in the sense of this of

5299.29 --> 5305.56
this life so you know it's which one

5302.68 --> 5308.14
it's everything it's it's all I see it's

5305.56 --> 5310.6
this unity line it's everything it's how

5308.14 --> 5313.6
we got here it's the stuff that's put in

5310.6 --> 5315.280000000001
our lap we're told exactly here it is

5313.6 --> 5316.6900000000005
this is the instructions this is the

5315.28 --> 5318.91
method and here are all the things

5316.69 --> 5321.219999999999
that's gonna support everything from the

5318.91 --> 5323.92
very beginning to from from from where

5321.22 --> 5325.66
I've come under the pump there from

5323.92 --> 5328.3
going to school and actually go to

5325.66 --> 5331.42
college and then you know and then being

5328.3 --> 5336.1900000000005
15 years in the occupation think about

5331.42 --> 5339.52
it the occupation yeah yeah I know you

5336.19 --> 5341.0199999999995
know no I want to be sure but yeah if we

5339.52 --> 5345.6900000000005
want to teach you have to go to school

5341.02 --> 5348.25
and teach people [ __ ] not right

5345.69 --> 5349.36
exactly exactly well well it's I got to

5348.25 --> 5351.01
leave I got to go pick up some more

5349.36 --> 5354.04
materials man so I'll probably be on

5351.01 --> 5360.93
later okay to pick your flip all right

5354.04 --> 5363.4
though yep thanks our yeah but I dude I

5360.93 --> 5365.740000000001
had kind of a similar breakdown

5363.4 --> 5369.339999999999
yesterday behind the scenes for a moment

5365.74 --> 5371.95
and yeah some time ago as well it's

5369.34 --> 5375.49
frustrating to see once you start to

5371.95 --> 5377.62
understand once you're inside sharpens

5375.49 --> 5381.37
and you see more of the complete picture

5377.62 --> 5384.88
yeah the whole body of science that

5381.37 --> 5387.73
giant Luciferian angel of Lies that

5384.88 --> 5389.92
seemingly is one structure in which

5387.73 --> 5392.5
people move yeah it starts to stare you

5389.92 --> 5394.09
in the face like yeah I am giant I am

5392.5 --> 5395.94
all enveloping what are you gonna do

5394.09 --> 5398.610000000001
about it you think you can oppose me

5395.94 --> 5401.0199999999995
everybody's mind controlled by it

5398.61 --> 5402.579
everybody opposes you even if you're

5401.02 --> 5405.030000000001
trying to rescue the

5402.579 --> 5408.88
yeah if you're trying to rescue them

5405.03 --> 5410.86
instinctively doesn't give a [ __ ] so

5408.88 --> 5413.26
what are you gonna do about it well the

5410.86 --> 5418.17
only thing you can do about it ignore it

5413.26 --> 5421.599
and follow that path and be a new

5418.17 --> 5423.9400000000005
example for others to follow that path

5421.599 --> 5427.4490000000005
because if enough people start to do

5423.94 --> 5430.719
that and just go with truth and just be

5427.449 --> 5434.0199999999995
honest just be pure like paladin's I

5430.719 --> 5438.01
guess very goody two-shoes but very

5434.02 --> 5441.4890000000005
serious not weak but strong determined

5438.01 --> 5444.67
just all this and also figuring out

5441.489 --> 5447.549999999999
morality once again actually getting

5444.67 --> 5450.57
really serious about that if enough

5447.55 --> 5453.6990000000005
people do this then eventually yeah

5450.57 --> 5458.44
Lucifer will weaken and it will be

5453.699 --> 5460.598999999999
dropped like a rag to the side like oh

5458.44 --> 5462.669999999999
yeah that's nice story is really cool oh

5460.599 --> 5464.5
cool yes cool keep on making those

5462.67 --> 5467.02
science fiction movies it's awesome we

5464.5 --> 5470.05
love those stories but yeah we know the

5467.02 --> 5473.59
truth now because everybody's woken up

5470.05 --> 5475.63
everybody started to walk the path you

5473.59 --> 5479.07
know that's what I believe can happen

5475.63 --> 5479.07
that's what should happen

5480.04 --> 5486.67
and yeah if you think about that just

5484.09 --> 5490.6900000000005
keep on going it's so monolithic right

5486.67 --> 5493.15
there but you you can't change it right

5490.69 --> 5495.549999999999
away you can't just bump your head into

5493.15 --> 5497.98
it hoping that it'll change right now

5495.55 --> 5499.99
it's not gonna happen first you're gonna

5497.98 --> 5502.45
have to get used to it that it exists

5499.99 --> 5505.389999999999
and then defend yourself against its

5502.45 --> 5510.97
influences and then once you got that

5505.39 --> 5513.75
done you can start to find through your

5510.97 --> 5516.39
own insight find a way through it all

5513.75 --> 5520.9
how are you gonna maneuver how what

5516.39 --> 5524.9800000000005
responses are you gonna get and just

5520.9 --> 5526.8099999999995
find a way through and once you have a

5524.98 --> 5528.79
good picture it doesn't have to reach

5526.81 --> 5531.34
into the far far future it can just be

5528.79 --> 5534.73
basic plans something do something Flat

5531.34 --> 5538.06
Earth related in whatever ever flat

5534.73 --> 5541.419999999999
earth cafe you know do a hangout do a

5538.06 --> 5544.09
show the breakfast show anything can be

5541.42 --> 5547.54
very simple at the beginning but you can

5544.09 --> 5550.93
also link very far ahead and once you

5547.54 --> 5554.14
know that this motion is happening then

5550.93 --> 5555.52
suddenly that giant body Luciferian body

5554.14 --> 5558.820000000001
of science is no longer that

5555.52 --> 5562.05
intimidating it is right now but it is

5558.82 --> 5562.049999999999
weakening already

5563.83 --> 5569.98
you know what it means yes sorry Barwon

5699.18 --> 5704.1
supported by some people and that really

5701.34 --> 5706.89
got me through a tight financial period

5704.1 --> 5708.900000000001
because I am I guess also because of the

5706.89 --> 5712.410000000001
Christmas period kind of a little bit

5708.9 --> 5715.259999999999
