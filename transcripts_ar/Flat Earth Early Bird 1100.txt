yeah pay off certain debts and i have

146.319 --> 149.92
unfortunately though

i think i might have overdone it a

149.92 --> 154.879
little can't really reverse that

152.959 --> 157.12
right so i thought

154.879 --> 159.35999999999999
i basically thought i had more than i

157.12 --> 159.36
did

160.239 --> 163.36
because i suck

162.16 --> 166.48
with money

599.2 --> 601.6800000000001

601.76 --> 606.72
well except for now

603.519 --> 610.279
that i read it from your message matthew

606.72 --> 610.279
mitchell what

621.04 --> 626.079
oh bo yeah i said bowels not balls

626.56 --> 630.0

and not really aching it's just they're

630.0 --> 634.88
still i don't know man i think i might

632.079 --> 634.88
be having like

638.32 --> 645.44
sort of a cold slash flu but it's like

642.48 --> 647.519
it doesn't even fully manifest but i i'm

645.44 --> 649.6
just noticing that

647.519 --> 652.24
i'm like having certain side effects

649.6 --> 655.0400000000001
that i typically associate with

652.24 --> 657.2
that with that condition except i'm not

655.04 --> 659.4399999999999
really typically all super

657.2 --> 661.839
in the flue and all that

659.44 --> 661.839
right

662.32 --> 668.8000000000001
so yeah whatever's going on my

664.56 --> 668.8
intestines and all that aren't just like

675.68 --> 681.12
they're they're going through a reset or

677.92 --> 684.079
something not my balls no they're

681.12 --> 684.079
perfectly fine

684.56 --> 687.56
uh

696.32 --> 703.48
did no fuzzy bush monk i think that you

699.279 --> 703.48
literally just made that up

705.2 --> 708.24
what condition

710.24 --> 713.839
do am i sick

712.079 --> 714.8389999999999
no not really

713.839 --> 717.12
it's

714.839 --> 720.0790000000001
just flu

717.12 --> 722.24
type thing except not my lungs and

720.079 --> 725.56
everything like they seem to be doing

722.24 --> 725.5600000000001
just fine

737.279 --> 739.6
okay

739.68 --> 742.56
one of the guys

741.04 --> 744.8
uh

742.56 --> 747.1199999999999
okay fuzzy bush monk

744.8 --> 747.12
sure

748.48 --> 755.2
is there anything suspicious about it

751.2 --> 755.2
because yeah that can just happen

756.32 --> 759.9200000000001
oh

757.12 --> 762.24
gadget it's your birthday today

759.92 --> 765.24
ah all right happy birthday gadget

762.24 --> 765.24
inspector

782.399 --> 786.68
right so yeah again

790.72 --> 795.2
i'm not like

792.639 --> 797.36
wonky like it was yesterday i'm doing

795.2 --> 801.0400000000001
fine but i am nervous because yeah my

797.36 --> 802.16
financial situation is not great i mean

801.04 --> 804.079
i did

802.16 --> 805.8389999999999
cut a few

804.079 --> 808.2399999999999
growing debts

805.839 --> 810.1600000000001
out of the way that because i did it

808.24 --> 812.9590000000001
because yeah if i would have waited

810.16 --> 815.04
longer then you get fines on that [Â __Â ]

812.959 --> 817.92
that you also have to pay back

815.04 --> 820.3199999999999
so yeah i basically tried to

817.92 --> 821.5999999999999
spare myself

820.32 --> 824.9590000000001
from

821.6 --> 827.1990000000001
growing the debt but yeah it has kind of

824.959 --> 829.8389999999999
the surplus i got

827.199 --> 831.92
from the

829.839 --> 833.6
from the night i'll show ya ran out

831.92 --> 836.4799999999999
because of that

833.6 --> 838.639
and i still need to get through at least

836.48 --> 840.0
another week

838.639 --> 842.639
right now

840.0 --> 844.959
so i can really really use the support

842.639 --> 844.9590000000001
sorry

845.68 --> 851.4399999999999
sorry that it's like that

848.72 --> 852.88
i really hope some of the

851.44 --> 856.5600000000001
the more

852.88 --> 859.04
wealthy guys around there

856.56 --> 861.3599999999999
pick up on this i could really use it

859.04 --> 861.36
right now

867.519 --> 873.6
so yeah i'm gonna keep reminding you of

870.32 --> 873.6
that in this show

874.0 --> 878.72
because sometimes i think that it's i

876.399 --> 878.72
don't know

879.12 --> 884.639
if i just say it a little bit then

881.519 --> 887.279
people seem to just overlook it

884.639 --> 888.32
i have to really kind of like hey hello

887.279 --> 890.88
hi

888.32 --> 893.6800000000001
i really need it so yeah that's what i'm

890.88 --> 893.68
doing right now

897.04 --> 900.3199999999999
hello steamy traveler

900.56 --> 903.56
jbdl2021

904.88 --> 910.0
skinned i wish yeah that's that's fine

907.04 --> 912.56
yeah like i'm not expecting all the

910.0 --> 914.32
typical chat participants

912.56 --> 916.8
to basically

914.32 --> 918.88
empty their pockets that's not

916.8 --> 921.519
but there are other people that are not

918.88 --> 924.16
constantly in my chat

921.519 --> 927.279
that do sponsor me

924.16 --> 931.16
and i'm hope i hope that i can basically

927.279 --> 931.16
catch their attention

yeah i already did that thank you very

1076.799 --> 1079.039

1079.44 --> 1084.96
i i basically checked my paypal before

1082.16 --> 1087.039
you even were in the chat

1084.96 --> 1091.88
thank you very much man i really

1087.039 --> 1091.8799999999999
appreciate it that's perfect timing

1097.76 --> 1102.24
all right so yeah let's

1099.6 --> 1106.1599999999999
try to get to some subject

1102.24 --> 1106.16
yeah gadget inspector effie pilot

1106.64 --> 1111.919
yeah he was a very

1108.64 --> 1111.919
deep-rooted zealot

1112.799 --> 1119.28
and nathan that made short work of him

1116.72 --> 1119.28
right also

1119.52 --> 1124.24
33 euros is a freemason number yeah so

1121.919 --> 1126.48
is my email address

1124.24 --> 1126.48
uh

1128.4 --> 1132.64
but yeah the show with effie pilot was

1130.799 --> 1134.84
also the same show that caused me to

1132.64 --> 1138.48
kind of get be really

1134.84 --> 1140.24
sick on saturday

1138.48 --> 1142.72
but nathan

1140.24 --> 1145.44
well had decided to completely cut out

1142.72 --> 1145.44
that segment

1145.679 --> 1151.8400000000001
because probably he thought that's not

1147.76 --> 1151.84
good that's not good for anybody

1153.52 --> 1159.039
and yeah that certainly made the show

1156.799 --> 1161.679
like i think that was a wise decision

1159.039 --> 1165.16
not just because

1161.679 --> 1165.16
personal reasons

1169.52 --> 1173.9189999999999
and yeah because now it's just a great

1171.44 --> 1175.1200000000001
show without that part

1173.919 --> 1177.8400000000001
that was like

1175.12 --> 1179.6789999999999
well at the end

1177.84 --> 1182.9599999999998
conversation roll out of it and i got

1179.679 --> 1182.96
really pissed off and left

1183.28 --> 1187.799
and it was about looping and all that

1193.28 --> 1198.08
all right i wonder if nathan still has

1195.44 --> 1201.96
the original conversation like on his

1198.08 --> 1201.96
computer might have

1219.6 --> 1225.28
right so yeah

1222.0 --> 1225.28
it yeah it was what it was

1228.559 --> 1233.039
our balls are on wheelchairs now because

1230.64 --> 1235.2800000000002
of taking i don't know

1233.039 --> 1236.48
there are three or six i know that i've

1235.28 --> 1238.32
heard

1236.48 --> 1239.52
that fight the flat earth is like in a

1238.32 --> 1240.8799999999999
wheelchair

1239.52 --> 1242.96
but

1240.88 --> 1248.2
no i haven't it's

1242.96 --> 1248.2
it might have been like for a long time

1248.72 --> 1253.6000000000001
i don't know if it was if it had

1250.96 --> 1254.799
anything to do with the recent

1253.6 --> 1257.36
v

1254.799 --> 1259.12
situation in the last two years i don't

1257.36 --> 1260.559
know i don't know the details but i

1259.12 --> 1263.4399999999998
heard that he is in a wheelchair

1260.559 --> 1266.559
apparently

1263.44 --> 1268.559
yeah also picked up on

1266.559 --> 1271.6
um

1268.559 --> 1273.6
mr sensible oh i i think i shared that

1271.6 --> 1276.559
message yesterday didn't i

1273.6 --> 1279.6789999999999
or was it the day before

1276.559 --> 1282.3999999999999
so he's having side effects by his own

1279.679 --> 1282.4
yeah admission

1282.96 --> 1286.8400000000001
and still doubling down

1334.96 --> 1339.679
what

1335.919 --> 1339.679
no i have not heard about that

1340.2 --> 1345.4
jbdl2021 that sounds really silly

1355.039 --> 1358.8799999999999
i'll be back in two minutes i don't know

1356.88 --> 1361.8400000000001
what's happening

1358.88 --> 1361.8400000000001
weird

1378.24 --> 1381.24
so

1464.24 --> 1467.679
okay

1466.159 --> 1469.919
yo

1467.679 --> 1469.919
uh

1470.24 --> 1474.08
i think it might have something to do

1472.08 --> 1476.6399999999999
with coffee

1474.08 --> 1478.32
i'm gonna try to not drink coffee for a

1476.64 --> 1481.2
while

1478.32 --> 1484.1589999999999
or like the sugar in the coffee

1481.2 --> 1486.799
and maybe that'll stop this because this

1484.159 --> 1490.64
is annoying to me it's not like super

1486.799 --> 1490.6399999999999
uncomfortable but it is annoying

1493.919 --> 1498.96
it's bad food no

1496.08 --> 1498.96
no that's not it

1499.12 --> 1507.52
i've eaten just fine actually eaten

1503.679 --> 1507.52
not even that much yesterday

1510.48 --> 1517.6
i'm in like semi-fasting mode just

1513.679 --> 1520.6000000000001
because i'm not all that super hungry

1517.6 --> 1520.6
overall

1537.36 --> 1541.559
yeah it's not alcohol either

1546.4 --> 1549.5590000000002
all right

1577.12 --> 1580.12
hmm

1592.799 --> 1595.039
ah

1597.36 --> 1601.76
i don't know

1599.6 --> 1604.32
maybe i'm just not in a great condition

1601.76 --> 1604.32
this week

1604.799 --> 1608.48
because i kind of feel the same like

1606.559 --> 1611.039
yesterday well not as bad i was like

1608.48 --> 1613.84
really not in focus then but i still

1611.039 --> 1613.84
feel

1623.6 --> 1628.3999999999999
i don't know maybe it's just also about

1625.6 --> 1631.52
this gray light in the day

1628.4 --> 1634.799
because when the evening falls

1631.52 --> 1634.799
i don't feel like this

1634.88 --> 1640.0
in the evening and in the night i feel

1637.039 --> 1641.919
just fine it's really in this grayish

1640.0 --> 1644.48
daylight that i start to feel like this

1641.919 --> 1644.48
it's weird

1646.24 --> 1653.08
anyway i am still just taking vitamin d

1649.52 --> 1653.08
three and all that

1655.44 --> 1659.039
hey pg christian good to see you

1666.799 --> 1670.1589999999999
take a week off then come back

1668.64 --> 1672.3990000000001
regenerated

1670.159 --> 1672.3990000000001
well

1674.72 --> 1679.279
oh rob yeah

1676.159 --> 1679.279
i appreciate that

1679.44 --> 1685.44
but i don't know if that's yeah if i can

1682.72 --> 1686.64
basically afford that i i need to keep

1685.44 --> 1688.24
going

1686.64 --> 1691.039
right

1688.24 --> 1693.36
i mean if i was like really sick like i

1691.039 --> 1695.6
have been a couple of times like for

1693.36 --> 1697.6
example last year

1695.6 --> 1699.12
yeah then i'm just not gonna stream for

1697.6 --> 1702.7199999999998
a week

1699.12 --> 1702.7199999999998
but i don't really feel like that

1706.96 --> 1712.08
and besides like when i start up the

1708.88 --> 1714.3990000000001
show i it's weird it's like i i feel

1712.08 --> 1716.1589999999999
just fine

1714.399 --> 1717.279
but then when it starts i don't know i

1716.159 --> 1721.1200000000001
get

1717.279 --> 1723.279
entangled as i do normally and then

1721.12 --> 1726.8799999999999
like it starts to burden me so it's kind

1723.279 --> 1726.88
of like unpredictable a little

1728.48 --> 1732.48
just have to size it up as i do it

1735.84 --> 1740.9599999999998
send another oh that is awesome robert i

1738.88 --> 1744.5590000000002
thank you so much man i really

1740.96 --> 1744.559
appreciate it i really do

1751.44 --> 1753.8400000000001
yeah

1754.24 --> 1758.08
it's

1756.159 --> 1760.0
it's a bit of a shame

1758.08 --> 1762.559
because there are like things i want to

1760.0 --> 1762.559
talk about

1763.52 --> 1767.799
but it requires focus

1770.48 --> 1775.559
uh

1772.0 --> 1775.559
god not again

1795.36 --> 1798.36
okay

1864.32 --> 1867.32
ugh

1895.44 --> 1898.44
shhh

1908.159 --> 1915.64
pump and dump is the ultimate boys club

1911.84 --> 1915.6399999999999
or just gay

1929.519 --> 1931.84
what

1933.2 --> 1939.88
he has that end taking vitamin c that is

1936.24 --> 1939.88
bad idea one

1950.32 --> 1954.96
no i think it's

1952.799 --> 1956.8799999999999
well i'm not i'm gonna spare you all the

1954.96 --> 1960.96
details but i think it has to do with

1956.88 --> 1960.96
like the coffee and the sugar i take

1961.36 --> 1967.76
i think that is the cause

1963.679 --> 1967.76
or rather like the the thing that

1968.64 --> 1972.96
yeah it's not

1971.12 --> 1975.1999999999998
it's the drop that makes the bucket

1972.96 --> 1978.08
spill like that effect

1975.2 --> 1980.72
that's it so that's why i i'm now

1978.08 --> 1983.12
deciding like okay i'm not gonna

1980.72 --> 1984.96
drink coffee in them yeah in the morning

1983.12 --> 1986.8799999999999
for a while

1984.96 --> 1988.799
and then hopefully this stops happening

1986.88 --> 1991.0390000000002
because it's not like oh

1988.799 --> 1994.1589999999999
i'm really sick it's just kind of a

1991.039 --> 1994.1589999999999
nuisance constantly

1996.32 --> 2001.279
vitamin c gives you loose stool in high

1998.799 --> 2001.279
doses

2002.48 --> 2005.84
yeah no but that's not it

2010.48 --> 2014.799
i mean

2011.84 --> 2016.6399999999999
my supplement routine is the same it has

2014.799 --> 2018.48
been

2016.64 --> 2022.519
for a long time now

2018.48 --> 2022.519
so that can't be it

2040.799 --> 2043.9189999999999
nerves

2042.159 --> 2046.48
well

2043.919 --> 2048.2400000000002
nerves also seem to be a counterpart of

2046.48 --> 2050.8
the effect yes

2048.24 --> 2053.4399999999996
but look when i do my show

2050.8 --> 2056.3990000000003
shows i always have some level of nerve

2053.44 --> 2058.96
right it's like a stage fright nerve

2056.399 --> 2062.24
and i use that normally

2058.96 --> 2064.8
i utilize that it's just that

2062.24 --> 2067.4399999999996
it's a slight burden

2064.8 --> 2070.079
but then in combination right

2067.44 --> 2072.0
with okay it's a little it's like extra

2070.079 --> 2073.3590000000004
sensitive right now it has been for a

2072.0 --> 2076.56
while

2073.359 --> 2078.879
then the coffee on top makes that worse

2076.56 --> 2081.04
and there's sugar in there is probably

2078.879 --> 2082.48
parts certain organs aren't too happy

2081.04 --> 2086.399
about that

2082.48 --> 2087.359
and then that causes this annoying thing

2086.399 --> 2090.24
so

2087.359 --> 2093.359
it's a combination of all of it

2090.24 --> 2096.879
it's like ancestral wind weakness which

2093.359 --> 2099.04
currently is expressing in my organs

2096.879 --> 2103.56
and yeah the coffee with the sugar and

2099.04 --> 2103.56
the normal levels of stress

2110.079 --> 2117.6400000000003
too much ain't good well i only have one

2112.96 --> 2117.64
cup but even that is too much

2124.16 --> 2127.16
right

2137.52 --> 2141.839
banana it's good to make things okay

2139.52 --> 2145.4
that's interesting lloyd cole i'll i'll

2141.839 --> 2145.4
keep that in mind

2146.079 --> 2149.44
but look

2147.52 --> 2152.079
guarantee this is not a

2149.44 --> 2155.44
throughout the day situation for me it's

2152.079 --> 2157.2000000000003
not like our i've been like this all day

2155.44 --> 2159.04
yesterday

2157.2 --> 2161.04
no it it kind of

2159.04 --> 2164.4
just happens during the [Â __Â ] it's really

2161.04 --> 2166.96
annoying it happens during the show

2164.4 --> 2168.56
and then after the show is rounded out i

2166.96 --> 2170.839
lay down that

2168.56 --> 2173.839
that stage

2170.839 --> 2176.7999999999997
stress and then it just goes away

2173.839 --> 2179.119
it's still a little wobbly but no longer

2176.8 --> 2182.76
to the point where this happens so yeah

2179.119 --> 2182.76
it's circumstances

2196.16 --> 2201.44
but yeah at least i'm i'm stocked up on

2198.8 --> 2205.8390000000004
supplements

2201.44 --> 2205.839
i've cut most of my debt away

2206.8 --> 2211.8390000000004
so i'll be good like my overall costs

2209.839 --> 2213.44
for the coming month

2211.839 --> 2215.359
two months will be

2213.44 --> 2217.28
much less

2215.359 --> 2220.56
because i basically stocked up on all

2217.28 --> 2220.5600000000004
that so i don't have to worry

2220.96 --> 2226.8
seriously mini hiatus all right all

2223.68 --> 2230.3999999999996
right i will i will seriously consider

2226.8 --> 2232.4
that but you gotta realize that

2230.4 --> 2234.4
in a way

2232.4 --> 2236.7200000000003
it to a personal level now it's

2234.4 --> 2238.7200000000003
stressful for me not to do my show every

2236.72 --> 2239.7599999999998
day

2238.72 --> 2240.64
because i'm

2239.76 --> 2243.28
so

2240.64 --> 2245.52
set to doing it

2243.28 --> 2248.4
so when i then decide not to do it i

2245.52 --> 2250.48
have to have a real serious excuse

2248.4 --> 2252.8
right it's like going to work if you're

2250.48 --> 2255.04
just a little sniffy

2252.8 --> 2257.119
well maybe now with the craziness out

2255.04 --> 2258.88
there but like say 10 years ago if you

2257.119 --> 2262.32
have a job and you're a little sniffy

2258.88 --> 2263.839
you're not going to be like oh oh no i'm

2262.32 --> 2265.28
going to report in sick now you're just

2263.839 --> 2267.2799999999997
going to be like well what the [Â __Â ]

2265.28 --> 2270.0
maybe i blow my nose a couple of extra

2267.28 --> 2271.28
times

2270.0 --> 2273.92
that's it

2271.28 --> 2276.0
and that's how i treat

2273.92 --> 2280.0
this

2276.0 --> 2282.16
magnesium citrate yes yes yes

2280.0 --> 2285.28
it is excellent that's actually a good

2282.16 --> 2287.1189999999997
idea i've been taking more of it i take

2285.28 --> 2291.28
it especially in the night because it

2287.119 --> 2293.599
really acutely calms me down

2291.28 --> 2296.92
i'll try it right now let's see if that

2293.599 --> 2296.92
does something

2299.2 --> 2302.68
it's a good idea

2317.68 --> 2322.72
take a mini break over the christmas

2319.92 --> 2322.7200000000003
people busy

2323.359 --> 2326.359
maybe

2326.72 --> 2329.9599999999996
we'll see

2334.61 --> 2337.699
[Music]

2341.839 --> 2346.64
look guys i really appreciate the

2344.32 --> 2349.599
concern

2346.64 --> 2351.68
if i'm gonna really need like a a break

2349.599 --> 2352.7200000000003
from the early bird show to get my

2351.68 --> 2354.3999999999996
health

2352.72 --> 2357.1189999999997
realign or whatever

2354.4 --> 2360.0
i will do it but at this time

2357.119 --> 2362.48
i think it's i can i just have to figure

2360.0 --> 2365.04
out like how to slightly adapt in order

2362.48 --> 2367.04
to prevent this nuisance because it's

2365.04 --> 2369.839
right now it's nothing more than a real

2367.04 --> 2369.839
just a nuisance

2370.8 --> 2375.44
i don't feel like i'm risking breaking

2372.88 --> 2375.44
or anything

2376.0 --> 2381.079
hey neil cosatino good to see you ralph

2378.079 --> 2381.079
rodriguez

2383.92 --> 2386.92
uh

2406.4 --> 2409.64
oh wow

2411.119 --> 2413.359
huh

2414.4 --> 2417.76
okay

2415.44 --> 2421.2000000000003
i can literally feel it

2417.76 --> 2421.2000000000003
hitting certain points

2423.76 --> 2429.44
in a good way

2425.359 --> 2429.44
this might actually do the trick huh

2430.079 --> 2434.1600000000003
right but enough about all that this is

2432.319 --> 2435.119
this doesn't make for an interesting

2434.16 --> 2439.68
show

2435.119 --> 2443.76
really this is i am sorry people

2439.68 --> 2443.7599999999998
this is the arwyn health report

2444.48 --> 2451.319
i know that's not really what you come

2446.96 --> 2451.319
visit my show for i'm sorry

2454.64 --> 2460.4
right i have

2457.2 --> 2462.96
like i'm currently enjoying

2460.4 --> 2464.56
hearing classical music echoes in my

2462.96 --> 2465.68
head

2464.56 --> 2468.48
because

2465.68 --> 2470.56
i i like i play games here and there and

2468.48 --> 2472.16
yesterday i was playing civilization

2470.56 --> 2474.48
five again

2472.16 --> 2477.5989999999997
and then i suddenly decided like

2474.48 --> 2479.599
let's turn that music back on

2477.599 --> 2481.3590000000004
and i listened to it over the headphones

2479.599 --> 2483.28
and like that's

2481.359 --> 2485.68
the music in that game

2483.28 --> 2489.2000000000003
is genuine

2485.68 --> 2490.7999999999997
live recorded classical

2489.2 --> 2493.4399999999996
concert

2490.8 --> 2496.2400000000002
it's amazing neil shut up don't even

2493.44 --> 2496.2400000000002
joke about that

2496.56 --> 2502.0
and it was amazing because

2499.28 --> 2504.3190000000004
i was just listening

2502.0 --> 2505.44
and i could literally

2504.319 --> 2506.64
hear

2505.44 --> 2509.359
like

2506.64 --> 2511.92
it was like a 3d ra that's the amazing

2509.359 --> 2514.319
thing about live classical concerts and

2511.92 --> 2516.4
it's not like separatedly recorded

2514.319 --> 2519.839
instruments that are then assembled

2516.4 --> 2521.2000000000003
digitally no it was a room

2519.839 --> 2523.44
and i could

2521.2 --> 2526.0
zone in so much

2523.44 --> 2528.56
that i could place

2526.0 --> 2531.68
where the people

2528.56 --> 2534.48
like how it was arranged what was there

2531.68 --> 2536.3999999999996
i could see it through the sound

2534.48 --> 2538.4
recording because it was such a detailed

2536.4 --> 2541.52
refined recording was so detailed i

2538.4 --> 2543.839
could hear the the tapping the ticking

2541.52 --> 2544.96
accident ticking of people's shoes

2543.839 --> 2548.64
against

2544.96 --> 2548.64
their seats and i could hear

2548.72 --> 2552.7999999999997
like it was such a detailed recording

2551.04 --> 2555.119
but yeah that

2552.8 --> 2557.28
i never heard that before i never

2555.119 --> 2559.839
realized that it was like

2557.28 --> 2561.6800000000003
a real live recorded concert

2559.839 --> 2565.4
and i put it on

2561.68 --> 2565.3999999999996
just listened like

2566.56 --> 2570.56
and then he heard all these little

2568.16 --> 2571.44
details it was quite amazing to realize

2570.56 --> 2574.319
that

2571.44 --> 2576.8
so much detail can even be in a sound

2574.319 --> 2581.92
recording

2576.8 --> 2581.92
like it just contains the 3d

2583.119 --> 2588.88
sound information and i could very

2585.839 --> 2591.2
easily from hearing it reverse engineer

2588.88 --> 2593.839
like an echo location

2591.2 --> 2595.52
like what the recording

2593.839 --> 2599.2
must have been like

2595.52 --> 2602.319
and it was somebody recording in a

2599.2 --> 2605.4399999999996
in like a chamber music setup with

2602.319 --> 2608.56
people there that sometimes cough

2605.44 --> 2610.64
or tap their feet against the chair

2608.56 --> 2612.96
and i could all hear that it's pretty

2610.64 --> 2616.319
amazing

2612.96 --> 2616.319
so i'm kind of enjoying that

2618.16 --> 2622.27
it's it's nice to have classical music

2620.56 --> 2625.409
in your head

2622.27 --> 2625.409
[Music]

2626.4 --> 2633.2000000000003
because man

2628.4 --> 2636.4
also listening to it i realized like

2633.2 --> 2639.1189999999997
actual original classical music

2636.4 --> 2640.96
is like a whole nother level compared to

2639.119 --> 2643.76
music from

2640.96 --> 2645.839
movies movie music

2643.76 --> 2649.2000000000003
because

2645.839 --> 2652.64
what these com composers have done

2649.2 --> 2654.7999999999997
is like such a complex set of harmony

2652.64 --> 2654.7999999999997
and

2654.96 --> 2660.0
and melody that

2657.52 --> 2662.88
you can't do that in movies because it

2660.0 --> 2664.24
would be too distracting

2662.88 --> 2666.7200000000003
but it makes

2664.24 --> 2668.8799999999997
it like it really stood out to me like

2666.72 --> 2672.48
holy [Â __Â ] this is an actual classical

2668.88 --> 2675.6800000000003
composed music from like

2672.48 --> 2678.16
18th 19th century

2675.68 --> 2680.96
old renaissance even

2678.16 --> 2684.56
the classics but it's not just the

2680.96 --> 2686.4
classics it was also like slightly less

2684.56 --> 2688.4
well-known

2686.4 --> 2691.839
pieces

2688.4 --> 2691.839
but really beautiful

2696.8 --> 2700.4
and it's really funny because yeah

2698.48 --> 2704.119
civilization five i've literally had

2700.4 --> 2704.119
that game since

2704.4 --> 2707.4
2010

2711.76 --> 2714.96
and never really like i knew yeah

2713.28 --> 2718.079
there's classical music in there and

2714.96 --> 2720.0
it's like yeah pretty feels pretty cool

2718.079 --> 2721.92
good atmosphere but that's always like

2720.0 --> 2723.839
over the speaker but now i put it on the

2721.92 --> 2725.92
headphones and just listen to it and i

2723.839 --> 2728.88
was like holy [Â __Â ] this is really

2725.92 --> 2732.88
detailed recording

2728.88 --> 2735.76
and i'm kind of amazed by it

2732.88 --> 2737.76
so yeah if you ever if you can stomach

2735.76 --> 2739.5200000000004
classical music don't give you a

2737.76 --> 2741.76
headache or something because it does

2739.52 --> 2744.0
that for some people

2741.76 --> 2745.599
it's i would really recommend if you

2744.0 --> 2748.319
have the opportunity it's going to be

2745.599 --> 2751.44
more difficult in this world currently

2748.319 --> 2754.319
if you have the opportunity to ever sit

2751.44 --> 2757.28
through like a live chamber music

2754.319 --> 2760.0
classical concert especially with bigger

2757.28 --> 2764.1600000000003
ensembles

2760.0 --> 2766.8
like violins har piano horns

2764.16 --> 2768.0
i would do it i would do it at least

2766.8 --> 2773.2000000000003
once

2768.0 --> 2774.64
so you can really feel the magic the 3d

2773.2 --> 2777.5989999999997
magic

2774.64 --> 2780.4
of a classical music concert it being in

2777.599 --> 2783.3590000000004
the room it's so different it is really

2780.4 --> 2785.839
different from typically

2783.359 --> 2787.2
recorded or digitally

2785.839 --> 2790.48
assembled

2787.2 --> 2793.2799999999997
classical music and movie music

2790.48 --> 2793.28
try it out

2794.88 --> 2799.04
if you have the opportunity to to do

2797.44 --> 2802.319
that

2799.04 --> 2804.16
try it out just a test

2802.319 --> 2805.359
that experience for yourself with your

2804.16 --> 2809.04
ears

2805.359 --> 2810.88
it'll probably help your hearing

2809.04 --> 2813.2799999999997
it will it will probably help your

2810.88 --> 2813.28
hearing

2814.24 --> 2820.24
carol of the bells gets me

2816.72 --> 2820.24
going especially while driving

2823.119 --> 2827.48
yeah that's christmas music right

2838.8 --> 2845.599
a memphis man you been nymphoman

2842.88 --> 2848.88
what

2845.599 --> 2852.52
bex this is not the check

2848.88 --> 2852.52
for such subjects

2862.16 --> 2869.0
the highest sense is only vibration

2865.68 --> 2869.0
sure wrath

2889.599 --> 2892.88
ah

2890.72 --> 2895.68
oh yeah yeah that's that's right

2892.88 --> 2897.04
that's right neil i almost forgot that

2895.68 --> 2899.359
my mother

2897.04 --> 2902.88
was really into that she did that with

2899.359 --> 2905.04
me while i was in her belly

2902.88 --> 2907.44
and yeah my mother was

2905.04 --> 2910.5589999999997
my mother's literally or was

2907.44 --> 2913.839
a classical music composer among other

2910.559 --> 2915.76
things like i still remember as she was

2913.839 --> 2918.24
literally on the spot on her piano

2915.76 --> 2920.2400000000002
composing classical songs

2918.24 --> 2923.5989999999997
while i was just sitting somewhere

2920.24 --> 2925.52
playing with my legos or something

2923.599 --> 2927.04
i would hear her

2925.52 --> 2929.92
compose that

2927.04 --> 2932.4
slowly piece by piece hearing how she

2929.92 --> 2934.88
would figure it out

2932.4 --> 2934.88
amazing

2936.16 --> 2940.319
but

2938.079 --> 2942.96
yeah by the way that music that i

2940.319 --> 2945.52
remember her composing that music is

2942.96 --> 2946.8
actually uploaded on my computer my

2945.52 --> 2949.68
computer

2946.8 --> 2952.1600000000003
on this youtube channel

2949.68 --> 2954.64
my mother's music it's not like a

2952.16 --> 2957.5989999999997
guitarist performed it

2954.64 --> 2959.2799999999997
she composed that originally it was

2957.599 --> 2961.52
meant for guitars

2959.28 --> 2963.6800000000003
she composed it on her piano and i have

2961.52 --> 2964.96
the memory of that happening from my

2963.68 --> 2967.5989999999997
youth still

2964.96 --> 2970.079
very special

2967.599 --> 2973.44
but yeah she was always very fascinated

2970.079 --> 2975.52
by all you have to stimulate child while

2973.44 --> 2977.28
it's still in

2975.52 --> 2982.0
within the pregnancy

2977.28 --> 2982.0
by listening to like classical music

2982.319 --> 2985.839
and she would like even like

2986.0 --> 2993.599
try to see if she could feel a response

2991.04 --> 2993.599
from me

2994.559 --> 2999.3590000000004
to different music

2997.04 --> 3000.72
so yeah i've definitely been subjected

2999.359 --> 3002.96
to that and

3000.72 --> 3002.9599999999996
well

3003.359 --> 3010.319
i have a pretty amazing auditory system

3008.24 --> 3012.3999999999996
is that purely because of the classical

3010.319 --> 3014.88
music exposure

3012.4 --> 3018.0
as a little kid and even unborn i don't

3014.88 --> 3020.4
know i could just be an amazing hearing

3018.0 --> 3022.559
inherited from my mother

3020.4 --> 3025.52
because she had that too

3022.559 --> 3027.6800000000003
but it it probably did stimulate it

3025.52 --> 3031.359
starting at a very young age making me

3027.68 --> 3031.359
very auditory in nature

3034.559 --> 3039.2000000000003
developing those senses very young

3039.52 --> 3046.4
and also yeah i've never liked pop music

3043.04 --> 3046.4
like i never liked it

3047.599 --> 3052.96
i guess that's the downside like i i

3051.2 --> 3054.5589999999997
some people out there like they just

3052.96 --> 3057.599
like to put on

3054.559 --> 3059.76
typical pop music radio [Â __Â ] it's all

3057.599 --> 3061.92
the same it's only gotten worse it's now

3059.76 --> 3064.559
all the same like everything sounds the

3061.92 --> 3066.4
same it's so annoying

3064.559 --> 3068.8
and they're just like when it's in the

3066.4 --> 3071.359
background keeps me going and i'm like

3068.8 --> 3074.079
that's a detriment

3071.359 --> 3078.44
like i want that off because it's

3074.079 --> 3078.44
disruptive to my energy

3082.8 --> 3085.92
i like the intro music

3084.88 --> 3088.319
yeah yeah

3085.92 --> 3090.0
yeah i like my intro music

3088.319 --> 3092.48
made by chris berry

3090.0 --> 3094.8
like he composed that

3092.48 --> 3096.64
kind of gave him some directions but he

3094.8 --> 3099.599
made it completely

3096.64 --> 3101.359
and he played it and recorded it and i

3099.599 --> 3103.6800000000003
think i'm very happy with that interest

3101.359 --> 3104.7999999999997
song it's been there now for three years

3103.68 --> 3107.1189999999997
every day

3104.8 --> 3110.119
i think it's definitely lasted a test of

3107.119 --> 3110.119
time

3138.64 --> 3143.2799999999997
right but yeah i come from musical

3141.44 --> 3147.44
family literally

3143.28 --> 3147.44
both my parents were music teachers

3147.52 --> 3152.88
my dad taught guitar played guitar very

3150.96 --> 3154.96
well he's he's got issues with his

3152.88 --> 3157.119
fingers now so he's kind of retired from

3154.96 --> 3158.559
doing that entirely i think he regrets

3157.119 --> 3160.8
it

3158.559 --> 3162.3190000000004
he misses it because he was very good at

3160.8 --> 3164.319
it

3162.319 --> 3166.5589999999997
and my mom was literally a teacher at

3164.319 --> 3169.7599999999998
the conservatory in amsterdam

3166.559 --> 3173.3590000000004
quite famed for what she her

3169.76 --> 3176.0
contribution he was like zealous teacher

3173.359 --> 3177.68
very zealous she would sacrifice her own

3176.0 --> 3178.72
health

3177.68 --> 3182.72
for it

3178.72 --> 3182.72
unfortunately for us but and her

3183.2 --> 3187.1189999999997
and so yeah i grew up in a family where

3185.04 --> 3189.04
it was like music music music that was

3187.119 --> 3191.839
like the thing that we did

3189.04 --> 3194.839
as a family our family activity was like

3191.839 --> 3194.839
well

3195.04 --> 3199.44
making music

3197.2 --> 3201.52
with the flute

3199.44 --> 3204.48
typical flute

3201.52 --> 3207.2
and we would play even end up playing

3204.48 --> 3210.2400000000002
the songs that she composed and that was

3207.2 --> 3213.2
amazing it's like i'm learning music

3210.24 --> 3216.0
that lit classical music that my mother

3213.2 --> 3218.7999999999997
composed now that is freaking epic

3216.0 --> 3222.2
as a kid that is just

3218.8 --> 3222.2000000000003
really epic

3224.319 --> 3228.8
but yeah that only worked

3226.88 --> 3230.319
while my mother and my dad were good

3228.8 --> 3233.28
with each other

3230.319 --> 3235.839
so like yeah during my teens that all

3233.28 --> 3240.079
started to go to [Â __Â ] and so did well

3235.839 --> 3240.0789999999997
family activity time unfortunately

3241.2 --> 3246.0789999999997
and with that also i kind of lost my

3243.599 --> 3247.04
interest in music it

3246.079 --> 3248.96
sounds

3247.04 --> 3251.839
really tragic

3248.96 --> 3251.839
but i just

3253.76 --> 3260.3190000000004
i like to listen to music

3256.64 --> 3264.44
i really like to listen and study music

3260.319 --> 3264.44
as i would study people

3264.64 --> 3268.96
so i'm much more of an analyst

3266.96 --> 3272.88
in nature

3268.96 --> 3274.0
and not so much really a performer

3272.88 --> 3277.04
although i

3274.0 --> 3279.2
yeah i have like like i can sing for

3277.04 --> 3280.079
example but then again i don't have like

3279.2 --> 3282.48
the

3280.079 --> 3284.7200000000003
brilliant singing voice

3282.48 --> 3287.119
so that doesn't like if i would have had

3284.72 --> 3290.0
that i would probably

3287.119 --> 3292.319
like be a singer partially even just as

3290.0 --> 3293.44
a hobby i would do that because my voice

3292.319 --> 3295.04
would be

3293.44 --> 3296.799
epic

3295.04 --> 3300.16
because i can

3296.799 --> 3301.24
very much control the tone height

3300.16 --> 3304.839
perfectly

3301.24 --> 3307.1189999999997
perfectly i can i can do it

3304.839 --> 3310.16
perfectly no

3307.119 --> 3312.4
no modifications necessary i have a

3310.16 --> 3314.16
perfect tone height control

3312.4 --> 3317.44
perfect

3314.16 --> 3319.1189999999997
but yeah my voice is kind of scratchy

3317.44 --> 3320.4
so

3319.119 --> 3324.2400000000002
yeah

3320.4 --> 3324.2400000000002
it's not super special because of that

3327.76 --> 3332.7990000000004
but i'm yeah i do act like a parrot

3330.72 --> 3337.04
sometimes i hear something and even for

3332.799 --> 3339.599
the first time it's complicated melody

3337.04 --> 3343.04
and then i just recreate it i literally

3339.599 --> 3344.96
just follow the whole pattern perfectly

3343.04 --> 3346.96
the more difficult the more i like it

3344.96 --> 3349.52
because then it becomes slightly

3346.96 --> 3352.559
challenging to keep the sound levels

3349.52 --> 3352.559
exactly correct

3354.079 --> 3358.6400000000003
you did not help me sing black hole sun

3356.24 --> 3361.2
that day i did

3358.64 --> 3364.48
i did do that but i'm not gonna keep on

3361.2 --> 3364.48
singing it constantly

3366.96 --> 3374.44
besides black hole son is not

3368.96 --> 3374.44
really a challenging song to sing

3388.88 --> 3391.6800000000003
one for the human where are you getting

3390.4 --> 3394.1600000000003
this

3391.68 --> 3395.9199999999996
you're not seriously thinking that that

3394.16 --> 3398.48
video from

3395.92 --> 3399.52
awake souls is like legitimate evidence

3398.48 --> 3402.76
do you

3399.52 --> 3402.7599999999998
come on

3414.24 --> 3421.04
no i'm not gonna sing it now i'm not

3417.2 --> 3421.04
i'm not your singing puppet neil

3428.64 --> 3433.5989999999997
besides i think that black hole son is

3430.96 --> 3436.16
actually a depressing song

3433.599 --> 3439.6800000000003
and it reminds me of a time when i was

3436.16 --> 3439.68
like genuinely feeling

3440.48 --> 3444.0
we're all gonna die it's all going to

3442.88 --> 3447.2000000000003
fail

3444.0 --> 3449.359
yeah i don't like it i mean i think it's

3447.2 --> 3453.2
kind of beautiful the song but i don't

3449.359 --> 3456.0789999999997
like it i don't like the energy of it

3453.2 --> 3456.0789999999997
it's depressing

3457.04 --> 3461.04
watch the video of dave and wise after

3462.16 --> 3464.799
all right

3473.68 --> 3477.9199999999996
let me find that link again

3476.799 --> 3480.319
where is it

3477.92 --> 3480.319
oh yeah

3485.92 --> 3490.92
but yeah it seems preposterous though

3505.599 --> 3508.6400000000003
oh m appeal

3513.359 --> 3518.64
they sound like they're spray speaking

3515.44 --> 3523.2000000000003
legit no but they aren't awake soul is a

3518.64 --> 3525.5989999999997
full blow raving gamma savage he is the

3523.2 --> 3525.5989999999997
worst

3526.0 --> 3531.119
i've never actually heard him make

3528.16 --> 3534.16
accusations about people and then really

3531.119 --> 3534.1600000000003
follow up on it

3534.4 --> 3540.48
he's just attacking everybody

3537.359 --> 3541.5989999999997
and he's always done that you understand

3540.48 --> 3545.44
always

3541.599 --> 3547.92
done that from the start

3545.44 --> 3550.799
i've been on

3547.92 --> 3552.319
with him in a show one time

3550.799 --> 3554.48
and that's like years ago in the flat

3552.319 --> 3556.16
earth talks days i think i still have it

3554.48 --> 3559.04
uploaded

3556.16 --> 3561.2
and i didn't know him back then

3559.04 --> 3563.119
i just thought like i'm just gonna

3561.2 --> 3564.64
just do it live do it live i don't know

3563.119 --> 3565.52
who he is i'll figure it out while i'm

3564.64 --> 3568.72
going

3565.52 --> 3568.72
because i liked his

3568.799 --> 3574.0
his mental flexibility when it comes to

3570.88 --> 3576.319
cosmogeny because he kind of was

3574.0 --> 3580.24
on the ride with the looping effect but

3576.319 --> 3584.4
that's really been the only thing

3580.24 --> 3587.839
the rest is just a reifying

3584.4 --> 3587.839
wannabe priest

3596.319 --> 3600.799
all right but sure gadgets i'll check it

3598.96 --> 3603.44
out and we'll see but i already know the

3600.799 --> 3603.44
outcome though

3607.44 --> 3611.76
man

3609.119 --> 3613.119
that magnesium really did the trick it

3611.76 --> 3615.8390000000004
stopped

3613.119 --> 3615.839
this is awesome

3676.48 --> 3682.68
r atm i

3678.4 --> 3682.6800000000003
i have no idea who that is

3715.76 --> 3721.6800000000003
how could you say the 90s ruined music

3718.0 --> 3721.68
when it gave us too unlimited

3723.68 --> 3728.96
yeah that was like the dawn of the house

3726.559 --> 3728.96
era

3729.039 --> 3731.6800000000003
hilarious

3733.92 --> 3737.2000000000003
well it was kind of the time where

3735.52 --> 3739.119
suddenly

3737.2 --> 3741.839
computer-based sound effects were

3739.119 --> 3741.839
getting better

3744.559 --> 3748.2400000000002
that also happened in the 90s

3751.039 --> 3755.44
i mean you can clearly hear the

3752.64 --> 3758.64
difference between

3755.44 --> 3760.16
80s synthesizer sound effects

3758.64 --> 3762.64
and 90s

3760.16 --> 3764.8799999999997
because there was a big upgrade like

3762.64 --> 3767.5989999999997
even in like

3764.88 --> 3769.92
the electronics itself what what could

3767.599 --> 3773.3590000000004
be done with it

3769.92 --> 3776.0
it improved pretty dramatically

3773.359 --> 3779.119
so the soundscape really changed during

3776.0 --> 3781.039
the 90s and then kind of like after 2000

3779.119 --> 3783.039
it it maxed

3781.039 --> 3785.5200000000004
and we've had like

3783.039 --> 3788.4
pretty heavy

3785.52 --> 3790.72
heavy heavy detailed sound effects ever

3788.4 --> 3790.7200000000003
since

3791.839 --> 3796.119
that that can be mind-blowing

3812.16 --> 3817.8799999999997
80s 90s was nice club life

3814.83 --> 3817.88
[Music]

3820.48 --> 3823.88
it wasn't right

3825.28 --> 3830.88
like i only really started to go out

3828.64 --> 3830.8799999999997
uh

3831.839 --> 3836.68
basically the first decade of this

3833.68 --> 3836.68
century

3839.119 --> 3842.2400000000002
it's like 10 years

3842.72 --> 3847.5989999999997
and then after that

3845.2 --> 3850.9199999999996
it stopped

3847.599 --> 3850.92
i stopped

3852.319 --> 3856.319
and started kind of in like the general

3854.799 --> 3858.559
scene

3856.319 --> 3860.24
but yeah that's a bit boring and then

3858.559 --> 3861.92
the gothic

3860.24 --> 3863.9199999999996
suddenly hit

3861.92 --> 3867.2000000000003
the mainstream i got win of it and it

3863.92 --> 3869.039
was completely enchanted and all that

3867.2 --> 3871.68
so i started like

3869.039 --> 3873.6800000000003
interest with like gothic rock

3871.68 --> 3876.64
then

3873.68 --> 3879.359
also metal came in and black metal

3876.64 --> 3881.7599999999998
eventually and then eventually

3879.359 --> 3883.52
that changed kind of like two electro

3881.76 --> 3885.8390000000004
and the electro scene

3883.52 --> 3888.079
that's where i ended up

3885.839 --> 3891.5589999999997
i had the best times there in the

3888.079 --> 3891.559
electro scene

3898.319 --> 3902.5589999999997
do they put fluoride in the water in the

3900.079 --> 3904.319
netherlands no as far as i'm aware no

3902.559 --> 3906.6400000000003
they don't thank god

3904.319 --> 3906.64
well for

3906.839 --> 3910.92
rodrius hmm

3927.28 --> 3933.76
do i like alice vj i i'm not sure if i

3931.52 --> 3933.7599999999998
know

3935.28 --> 3939.28
it doesn't immediately ring a bell

3947.92 --> 3953.359
i mean most mainstream

3950.799 --> 3956.16
or like what was really going on in the

3953.359 --> 3958.0
80s and 90s i have no idea i was not

3956.16 --> 3960.72
even interested

3958.0 --> 3963.76
i got my own source of music that was

3960.72 --> 3966.0
basically handed to me by my parents who

3963.76 --> 3967.039
understood my needs

3966.0 --> 3969.44
so i

3967.039 --> 3972.2400000000002
in my youth i mostly got to enjoy well

3969.44 --> 3974.079
the music my mother made and things like

3972.24 --> 3975.0389999999998
the police

3974.079 --> 3977.039
and

3975.039 --> 3979.599
kate bush

3977.039 --> 3981.44
and also brian adams

3979.599 --> 3982.96
rupert heinz

3981.44 --> 3985.2000000000003
all these

3982.96 --> 3986.4
yeah

3985.2 --> 3988.799
like

3986.4 --> 3990.2400000000002
prince

3988.799 --> 3993.119
like

3990.24 --> 3995.52
people that did actually have musical

3993.119 --> 3995.52
talent

3996.0 --> 4002.079
and that were also had interesting

4000.079 --> 4004.2400000000002
songs that they made right because

4002.079 --> 4008.079
they're like the mainstream was is

4004.24 --> 4010.319
always garbage it was always garbage

4008.079 --> 4010.319
and

4010.559 --> 4014.88
yeah

4012.0 --> 4017.119
i it never appealed to me like it would

4014.88 --> 4019.039
our family when i was a little kid would

4017.119 --> 4021.2000000000003
be like

4019.039 --> 4023.5200000000004
not that music let's get out here and we

4021.2 --> 4027.2
would all agree like get out at that

4023.52 --> 4027.2
it's ugh ugly music

4029.28 --> 4035.8390000000004
yeah police is amazing it is genuinely

4032.88 --> 4035.839
amazing

4038.88 --> 4043.119
it's kind of

4040.4 --> 4045.28
slow now a bit old but

4043.119 --> 4046.799
melodically it was brilliant and there's

4045.28 --> 4049.2000000000003
still people to this day that are

4046.799 --> 4051.44
completely musicians that are completely

4049.2 --> 4055.72
fascinated about it

4051.44 --> 4055.7200000000003
about the police and sting

4066.559 --> 4070.6400000000003
no band sounds like the police right

4068.319 --> 4072.48
they can't yeah they

4070.64 --> 4074.319
well if they would sound like the police

4072.48 --> 4077.119
it would be like hey you're sounding

4074.319 --> 4078.88
like the police

4077.119 --> 4080.319
and then people would probably okay if

4078.88 --> 4083.039
you're so good at sounding like the

4080.319 --> 4086.079
police then just play the police

4083.039 --> 4086.079
it's like they really

4086.88 --> 4092.079
like built their own musical virtual

4089.52 --> 4093.44
castle in the soundscape do by doing all

4092.079 --> 4095.599
that

4093.44 --> 4097.359
and if anybody tries to do something

4095.599 --> 4100.88
like that they'll just sound like the

4097.359 --> 4100.88
police that's now what it is

4101.839 --> 4105.839
driven to tears oh yeah

4111.52 --> 4116.080000000001
i still remember the

4113.52 --> 4116.96
the album cover

4116.08 --> 4119.12
from

4116.96 --> 4121.199
zata mondatta

4119.12 --> 4125.5199999999995
that gave me nightmares there were like

4121.199 --> 4127.599999999999
some really creepy imagery on that thing

4125.52 --> 4129.92
like it literally haunted me i was

4127.6 --> 4132.64
obsessed with that album cover the back

4129.92 --> 4134.319
of it

4132.64 --> 4136.56
let's see if there's some pictures still

4134.319 --> 4136.56

4410.32 --> 4413.799999999999
what are you doing

4423.44 --> 4427.839999999999
not for much longer what are you talking

4425.199 --> 4427.839999999999
about gloria

4442.64 --> 4447.280000000001
that's princely what is friends lyrics

4448.4 --> 4452.4
how do you trim the ends is prince

4450.88 --> 4455.04
lyrics like what are you talking about

4452.4 --> 4455.04
gadgets

4458.719 --> 4463.679
i mean i can size up people's thoughts

4461.36 --> 4466.679
partially but i can't just read entire

4463.679 --> 4466.679
swaths

4468.159 --> 4471.839999999999
oh what pg

4470.08 --> 4474.4
right yeah well that part i didn't

4471.84 --> 4477.88
really care too much yes prince was a

4474.4 --> 4477.879999999999
squirt king

4484.32 --> 4487.04
he was

4487.44 --> 4491.199
it was all about the sex appeal and all

4490.0 --> 4493.92
that

4491.199 --> 4495.599999999999
it was weird like i didn't

4493.92 --> 4498.64
like that

4495.6 --> 4501.1990000000005
particularly although like

4498.64 --> 4505.280000000001
the confidence the man really had that

4501.199 --> 4505.28
part was appealing i did like that

4506.56 --> 4510.0
but

4508.159 --> 4511.199
yeah

4510.0 --> 4514.08
don't wanna

4511.199 --> 4516.639999999999
ruffle feathers but

4514.08 --> 4519.6
at times i thought that yeah that guy is

4516.64 --> 4521.360000000001
really heterosexual right

4519.6 --> 4524.360000000001
but at the same time he's also kind of

4521.36 --> 4524.36
gay

4524.4 --> 4527.679
yeah and that's going to make a whole

4525.679 --> 4529.6
bunch of people really pissed off at me

4527.679 --> 4531.28
but that's just how i felt about it i

4529.6 --> 4532.719
can't help it

4531.28 --> 4534.4
he's

4532.719 --> 4537.76
it's just that

4534.4 --> 4540.08
he was just so freaking 80s

4537.76 --> 4542.08
and 90s and

4540.08 --> 4545.679
how do you call that glam

4542.08 --> 4548.239
it was all about that and yeah

4545.679 --> 4548.2390000000005
i didn't know

4551.6 --> 4558.2390000000005
but he was very talented

4554.8 --> 4560.8
and like a really

4558.239 --> 4563.199
a bard like musician

4560.8 --> 4564.4800000000005
like i think he literally wrote every

4563.199 --> 4568.0
song

4564.48 --> 4570.32
himself and he's made a lot

4568.0 --> 4572.64
who was gay prince no he's not really

4570.32 --> 4572.639999999999
gay

4575.28 --> 4581.44
bisexual hetero ever what

4578.88 --> 4586.04
okay was he

4581.44 --> 4586.04
yeah i don't want to know

4600.56 --> 4602.88
all right

4604.8 --> 4609.8
now get your inspector come on

4614.64 --> 4619.6
mormon's family what

4617.199 --> 4619.599999999999
really

4620.88 --> 4626.2390000000005
wow i i didn't even know that

4627.04 --> 4630.44
that's bizarre

4637.6 --> 4643.280000000001
right but yeah no disrespect to prince

4640.0 --> 4646.08
and people that really like him

4643.28 --> 4646.8
i thought sometimes like yeah dude it's

4646.08 --> 4648.8
just

4646.8 --> 4651.28
like at some point it just kind of

4648.8 --> 4652.719
becomes gay

4651.28 --> 4655.12
with all this the

4652.719 --> 4656.719
unlimited sex and all that

4655.12 --> 4660.239
like at some point it kind of just

4656.719 --> 4663.44
becomes gay but yeah as a musician

4660.239 --> 4665.839999999999
he was amazing and he wrote like every

4663.44 --> 4667.839999999999
song himself like completely by himself

4665.84 --> 4669.1990000000005
and that yeah

4667.84 --> 4671.04
that

4669.199 --> 4675.199
demands respect

4671.04 --> 4675.199
no matter what their life in their

4675.52 --> 4679.320000000001
in their sexual life

4679.76 --> 4684.719
prince was a flat earther i would not be

4681.6 --> 4684.719
surprised if he was

4690.8 --> 4695.76
he was certainly like very risque

4693.76 --> 4697.679
in ways

4695.76 --> 4702.400000000001
he was kind of like a conspiracy

4697.679 --> 4702.4
theorist but he didn't yeah he

4704.32 --> 4708.96
he was just an artist i don't know

4707.199 --> 4713.639999999999
he got shut down

4708.96 --> 4713.64
partially probably yeah

4738.96 --> 4744.84
yes guys inspector indeed i remember

4741.679 --> 4744.84
that too

4748.88 --> 4751.88
um

4783.04 --> 4789.12
his favorite venue was the horse of troy

4786.56 --> 4791.84
and egg what

4789.12 --> 4791.84
okay

4803.76 --> 4806.76
okay

4820.56 --> 4824.080000000001
what's that at least g

4828.48 --> 4832.5199999999995
oh

4829.52 --> 4832.52
okay

4833.04 --> 4835.6
what the

4837.12 --> 4843.48
oh it's a video by you from october 13th

4840.48 --> 4843.48
hmm

4855.44 --> 4858.44
hmm

4876.56 --> 4879.52
yeah

4877.36 --> 4885.32
yeah i'm appeal well i'll never forget

4879.52 --> 4885.320000000001
1999 because i was 19 in 1999.

4885.44 --> 4889.08
was a lot of 19.

4897.52 --> 4901.6
also that was the year when i had my

4899.92 --> 4905.04
first

4901.6 --> 4905.04
really serious girlfriend

4914.159 --> 4920.879999999999
well at least serious on my side

4918.159 --> 4920.879999999999
see you later

4921.36 --> 4925.199
yeah she moved on at some point

4926.639 --> 4930.08
and then

4928.08 --> 4933.08
yeah now she has like three kids or

4930.08 --> 4933.08
something

4959.679 --> 4962.4800000000005
she escaped

4961.52 --> 4966.639
yeah

4962.48 --> 4966.638999999999
but it also just wasn't gonna work

4968.08 --> 4970.32
like

4970.96 --> 4975.679
i was kind of like her her test run

4973.76 --> 4978.2390000000005
boyfriend

4975.679 --> 4980.4
which is kind of embarrassing

4978.239 --> 4983.199
but i was just like really in love so i

4980.4 --> 4983.199
didn't give a [Â __Â ]

4983.36 --> 4990.88
but i was her first boyfriend

4987.76 --> 4993.76
and i like really

4990.88 --> 4995.36
yeah i was honorable

4993.76 --> 4997.4400000000005
but i was also

4995.36 --> 5000.32
having a lot of confidence issues with

4997.44 --> 5002.4
myself

5000.32 --> 5003.759999999999
and i think that is probably what ended

5002.4 --> 5004.799999999999
up

5003.76 --> 5009.360000000001
like

5004.8 --> 5009.360000000001
breaking the the real serious potential

5011.199 --> 5018.12
because i just wasn't man enough it's

5013.6 --> 5018.120000000001
really embarrassing but it's true

5037.199 --> 5042.28
internet went down new year's eve

5042.88 --> 5045.28
it did

5046.159 --> 5051.199
the supposed millennium bug i thought

5047.92 --> 5053.52
that was like completely overblown

5051.199 --> 5057.159
and besides at that time i had like a

5053.52 --> 5057.159000000001
call-in modem

5057.679 --> 5061.679
double speed double the cost so it's not

5060.719 --> 5063.679
like

5061.679 --> 5066.32
everybody was constantly connected to

5063.679 --> 5066.32
the internet

5067.6 --> 5070.84
i wasn't

5105.28 --> 5108.759999999999
what the hell

5114.159 --> 5117.879999999999
all right then wrong

5132.639 --> 5137.76
yeah it does make you wonder though you

5134.8 --> 5141.92
know peter khrushcheck

5137.76 --> 5145.12
with prince and the song 1999

5141.92 --> 5147.04
like the whole millennium thing

5145.12 --> 5150.08
because like

5147.04 --> 5153.5199999999995
one and a half years later 911 happened

5150.08 --> 5156.159
and that did kind of like end

5153.52 --> 5156.159000000001
the era

5163.92 --> 5169.6
like everything how it was just

5166.56 --> 5172.159000000001
doesn't work anymore after that happen

5169.6 --> 5175.04
like it's ruined

5172.159 --> 5175.04
the natural

5175.199 --> 5182.638999999999
cultural growth in in the wide society

5180.08 --> 5185.36
up until that point had been like

5182.639 --> 5187.679
glorious and like called yeah culture

5185.36 --> 5188.5599999999995
icons would be able to really do their

5187.679 --> 5190.0
thing

5188.56 --> 5192.8
mostly

5190.0 --> 5195.12
but after 9 11 like

5192.8 --> 5199.76
that all kind of changed and everything

5195.12 --> 5199.76
became so corporatized after that point

5200.239 --> 5204.239
that's when media really took a swing

5202.32 --> 5206.639
for the evil

5204.239 --> 5206.638999999999
a lot

5207.12 --> 5211.48
like more than ever before

5238.56 --> 5243.1990000000005
yeah but look worship jesus and m appeal

5241.6 --> 5245.84
the whole millennium bug it was

5243.199 --> 5248.4
ridiculous it was literally ridiculous

5245.84 --> 5249.52
because it was based on

5248.4 --> 5250.32
ooh

5249.52 --> 5252.400000000001
but

5250.32 --> 5256.48
we have really

5252.4 --> 5258.879999999999
really super outdated old computers

5256.48 --> 5262.718999999999
from like the 60s or something that

5258.88 --> 5264.400000000001
didn't have like that numeral capacity

5262.719 --> 5266.08
in the clock

5264.4 --> 5268.799999999999
system

5266.08 --> 5272.639
that was it it was basically oh we're

5268.8 --> 5275.679
afraid that critical systems are still

5272.639 --> 5278.400000000001
using these super super old outdated

5275.679 --> 5280.2390000000005
computers and that was the potential

5278.4 --> 5283.28
risk

5280.239 --> 5285.839999999999
but it didn't really happen

5283.28 --> 5288.0
like they didn't crash

5285.84 --> 5288.0
so

5289.28 --> 5292.88
it was just really silly

5293.52 --> 5296.400000000001
and overblown

5300.48 --> 5306.759999999999
that's a very real problem that was

5302.48 --> 5306.759999999999
mitigated no no wasn't

5310.8 --> 5316.76
the software that was not following oh

5313.76 --> 5316.76
okay

5322.48 --> 5327.12
right so old software problems

5326.239 --> 5329.199
okay

5327.12 --> 5332.32
yeah whether it's like computer clock

5329.199 --> 5332.32
system or software

5334.96 --> 5339.32
but it was still super overblown

5375.52 --> 5380.639
a lot of software assumed yeah

5391.679 --> 5396.639
right so what i think

5394.239 --> 5398.48
that basically signifies worship jesus

5396.639 --> 5400.719
is that

5398.48 --> 5402.959999999999
it was just old software development

5400.719 --> 5405.52
right like especially in the 80s there

5402.96 --> 5407.76
was like this massive

5405.52 --> 5409.76
software development move

5407.76 --> 5413.12
since the 70s or but in the 80s it

5409.76 --> 5416.400000000001
really hit off with the commodore 64.

5413.12 --> 5418.5599999999995
and like there was just people were like

5416.4 --> 5419.599999999999
big making themselves programmers and

5418.56 --> 5420.96
[Â __Â ]

5419.6 --> 5422.4800000000005
and

5420.96 --> 5423.76
yeah

5422.48 --> 5424.799999999999
apparently they

5423.76 --> 5427.4400000000005
they

5424.8 --> 5429.4400000000005
didn't really have like the super long

5427.44 --> 5431.12
term

5429.44 --> 5435.32
time

5431.12 --> 5435.32
in mind when they did that

5437.84 --> 5442.56
although it was already back then very

5440.239 --> 5444.799999999999
apparent that there was going to be very

5442.56 --> 5448.159000000001
rapid changes happening in computer

5444.8 --> 5450.639
world in software like it was happening

5448.159 --> 5453.44
things were being reconfigured figured

5450.639 --> 5455.36
out computers were getting better

5453.44 --> 5457.919999999999
modules

5455.36 --> 5460.719
were starting to be conceived the idea

5457.92 --> 5462.56
of module programming

5460.719 --> 5465.12
and there was just so much development

5462.56 --> 5465.120000000001
that people

5465.84 --> 5470.08
probably didn't yeah they just made

5468.0 --> 5471.92
programs assuming that they would be

5470.08 --> 5474.32
completely

5471.92 --> 5476.4
stopped being used in like five years or

5474.32 --> 5478.88
something

5476.4 --> 5480.5599999999995
but just quick quick on the run

5478.88 --> 5483.4400000000005
development because there's going to be

5480.56 --> 5485.360000000001
something newer later but yeah

5483.44 --> 5486.879999999999
that doesn't stop

5485.36 --> 5488.96
users of programs that aren't

5486.88 --> 5491.36
necessarily programmers from just like

5488.96 --> 5493.199
oh but it works so well even though it's

5491.36 --> 5495.839999999999
20 years old

5493.199 --> 5499.04
right so that was kind of the issue

5495.84 --> 5499.04
then i guess

5503.04 --> 5506.719
we're running windows in space

5508.239 --> 5512.5599999999995
yes yeah but that's that's very

5510.48 --> 5513.599999999999
different though worship jesus

5512.56 --> 5515.76
because

5513.6 --> 5518.2390000000005
after the 90s

5515.76 --> 5520.4800000000005
when module programming and all that

5518.239 --> 5524.159
really hit

5520.48 --> 5526.638999999999
the yeah the digital landscape

5524.159 --> 5528.32
it it's not as dramatic like there have

5526.639 --> 5532.0
not been

5528.32 --> 5534.32
like really heavy updates

5532.0 --> 5537.84
in software anymore

5534.32 --> 5539.759999999999
because it's not necessary it lit like

5537.84 --> 5542.32
there is no

5539.76 --> 5546.2390000000005
need there's like so much room

5542.32 --> 5548.159
with computers and software now

5546.239 --> 5551.678999999999
they do updates

5548.159 --> 5553.599999999999
really to as customer binding right like

5551.679 --> 5555.4400000000005
just like apple does it's like oh after

5553.6 --> 5558.4800000000005
a few years it doesn't work anymore you

5555.44 --> 5560.4
have to get to do one not because it

5558.48 --> 5562.5599999999995
actually doesn't work anymore

5560.4 --> 5564.799999999999
but because it's rigged to basically

5562.56 --> 5566.320000000001
start breaking down

5564.8 --> 5568.159000000001
when it wouldn't be rigged it wouldn't

5566.32 --> 5570.5599999999995
do that

5568.159 --> 5572.96
because they just want to sell the next

5570.56 --> 5572.96
batch

5573.44 --> 5575.759999999999
right

5575.04 --> 5580.56
but

5575.76 --> 5580.56
if that strategy application

5580.639 --> 5584.96
wasn't being done

5582.719 --> 5587.679
everything could run

5584.96 --> 5590.96
perfectly on the software even developed

5587.679 --> 5590.96
10 years ago and more

5591.44 --> 5597.759999999999
right because it's all modules

5594.32 --> 5600.5599999999995
and modules last a very long time and

5597.76 --> 5602.639
are easily replaceable

5600.56 --> 5604.96
when you really need to

5602.639 --> 5607.6
yeah update an aspect right you don't

5604.96 --> 5609.28
have to reprogram the entire thing just

5607.6 --> 5612.2390000000005
one model

5609.28 --> 5613.28
it's very easy that way

5612.239 --> 5616.879999999999
so

5613.28 --> 5619.5199999999995
yeah windows xp can work just fine i

5616.88 --> 5621.84
still use windows 7 and it works great

5619.52 --> 5626.1990000000005
it works absolutely great

5621.84 --> 5626.1990000000005
and i don't even need to update it

5638.639 --> 5642.84
right it's only when you're going to be

5641.12 --> 5644.4
hooked into the

5642.84 --> 5646.8
internet

5644.4 --> 5648.32
and like servers and all that that's

5646.8 --> 5651.4400000000005
when you really kind of need to be

5648.32 --> 5651.44
updated because

5652.0 --> 5654.239
like

5654.56 --> 5659.84
computer software infrastructure might

5657.199 --> 5661.199
have kind of hit its peak development

5659.84 --> 5663.04
for a while

5661.199 --> 5665.12
and module system is there and all that

5663.04 --> 5667.04
and new new things do keep popping up

5665.12 --> 5669.199
new mechanisms

5667.04 --> 5672.639
it's just not the real focus anymore now

5669.199 --> 5674.5599999999995
the focus is more like algorithms ai

5672.639 --> 5675.6
and

5674.56 --> 5678.2390000000005
well

5675.6 --> 5680.719
hacking and security against hacking

5678.239 --> 5681.5199999999995
right that's much more of a focus right

5680.719 --> 5684.159
now

5681.52 --> 5687.1990000000005
because just regular

5684.159 --> 5689.199
software that run on computers

5687.199 --> 5691.5199999999995
it's kind of maxed out

5689.199 --> 5691.5199999999995
it's like

5692.159 --> 5695.599999999999
yeah

5693.119 --> 5695.599999999999
it's like

5696.719 --> 5701.04
any improvements are more like

5699.36 --> 5702.719
cosmetic now

5701.04 --> 5704.48
because it's just

5702.719 --> 5707.36
it's all been developed

5704.48 --> 5710.239
it everything that you will ever need is

5707.36 --> 5713.799999999999
already developed really

5710.239 --> 5713.799999999999
software wise

5714.639 --> 5720.0
unless you yeah unless like oh you super

5717.84 --> 5721.92
super super latest state-of-the-art

5720.0 --> 5724.4
graphics well i can even tell you that

5721.92 --> 5726.719
in graphics development

5724.4 --> 5728.96
there is like a scaling issue i'm just

5726.719 --> 5732.56
going to call it scaling it's not

5728.96 --> 5735.6
not a literal that's me improvising it

5732.56 --> 5735.6
scaling issue that

5736.719 --> 5742.639
there's like oh look we got new

5740.0 --> 5745.36
chips and all that graphics card so that

5742.639 --> 5746.88
this can be much faster but then

5745.36 --> 5750.08
at the same time

5746.88 --> 5753.04
software developers that utilize it

5750.08 --> 5754.4
they've made a habit of modulizing too

5753.04 --> 5757.199
much

5754.4 --> 5759.44
and when you modulize too much with yeah

5757.199 --> 5761.44
with software that really depends on

5759.44 --> 5765.199
quickness quickness quickness

5761.44 --> 5768.08
then it slows [Â __Â ] down so if you now

5765.199 --> 5770.638999999999
buy like well i had the issue

5768.08 --> 5772.8
even with baldur's gate

5770.639 --> 5774.56
uh three

5772.8 --> 5777.1990000000005
it was obviously

5774.56 --> 5780.080000000001
programmed modulized because it just

5777.199 --> 5782.799999999999
kept slow and slow it was had a lot of

5780.08 --> 5786.239
like leg issues even though my computer

5782.8 --> 5788.2390000000005
is like insanely fast

5786.239 --> 5789.839999999999
and the graphics were not even that

5788.239 --> 5792.799999999999
super special

5789.84 --> 5796.159000000001
it's because it's all modulized

5792.8 --> 5799.92
because it isn't like they used to do

5796.159 --> 5802.239
programmed code for scratch to optimize

5799.92 --> 5805.76
it to make it really really really super

5802.239 --> 5808.718999999999
fast but it also means a giant pile of

5805.76 --> 5810.8
work that once it's rounded out you

5808.719 --> 5812.88
can't really modify it anymore right

5810.8 --> 5814.320000000001
that's the downside modulized

5812.88 --> 5817.04
programming

5814.32 --> 5820.719
allows you to very easily update things

5817.04 --> 5822.8
but it's also clunky as [Â __Â ]

5820.719 --> 5825.6
that's the problem that's the big

5822.8 --> 5825.6
difference now

5825.76 --> 5829.119000000001
so

5826.56 --> 5830.56
a lot of new games are super slow on

5829.119 --> 5833.599999999999
your computer

5830.56 --> 5836.159000000001
not because it's even that demanding but

5833.6 --> 5837.76
it's because it's modulized and kind of

5836.159 --> 5840.5599999999995
clunky

5837.76 --> 5842.2390000000005
when like a real set of programmers

5840.56 --> 5844.2390000000005
old-fashioned and they probably don't

5842.239 --> 5846.159
even want to do that anymore because

5844.239 --> 5848.48
modulizing has kind of made everybody

5846.159 --> 5850.159
lazy in the programming world

5848.48 --> 5853.599999999999
but if they would

5850.159 --> 5854.48
they could make any game any 3d engine

5853.6 --> 5855.280000000001
game

5854.48 --> 5856.48
like

5855.28 --> 5858.32
mega

5856.48 --> 5860.239
mega efficient

5858.32 --> 5862.5599999999995
that you could even run it on an older

5860.239 --> 5864.08
computer and it would still be

5862.56 --> 5866.400000000001
spotless

5864.08 --> 5868.8
they could do that but they don't

5866.4 --> 5870.48
because it's too much work

5868.8 --> 5873.1990000000005
now

5870.48 --> 5875.678999999999
that too much work in the 90s used to be

5873.199 --> 5877.199
the default it's like yeah we need

5875.679 --> 5882.1990000000005
people that

5877.199 --> 5882.199
can do too much work the programmers

5882.32 --> 5887.28
there was a high demand for that because

5884.0 --> 5889.6
there was no modulizing system

5887.28 --> 5892.4
that would make programming kind of easy

5889.6 --> 5892.400000000001
but clunky

5893.52 --> 5898.639
except maybe for like early java and all

5896.48 --> 5898.638999999999
that

5900.48 --> 5903.678999999999
right

5902.0 --> 5905.6
isn't that interesting how much i know

5903.679 --> 5907.4400000000005
about this even though i am technically

5905.6 --> 5909.360000000001
not a programmer

5907.44 --> 5911.44
but it's because yeah i've known a lot

5909.36 --> 5913.839999999999
of programmers and i was always very

5911.44 --> 5915.919999999999
interested in in it

5913.84 --> 5918.8
like how does this work how is this this

5915.92 --> 5920.0
developing not because i want to do it

5918.8 --> 5921.76
no that

5920.0 --> 5923.679
actually the more i learned about it the

5921.76 --> 5926.0
less i wanted to do because it's like

5923.679 --> 5929.84
yeah oh i'm gonna quickly learn this

5926.0 --> 5931.28
system c plus plus q bl

5929.84 --> 5932.32
whatever

5931.28 --> 5933.84
and then

5932.32 --> 5935.759999999999
to know

5933.84 --> 5937.52
that in two years it would be completely

5935.76 --> 5939.1990000000005
outdated and i would have to start over

5937.52 --> 5941.280000000001
again i was like

5939.199 --> 5944.08
screw that

5941.28 --> 5946.159
i'm not gonna do that

5944.08 --> 5951.0
no i'll just settle for understanding

5946.159 --> 5951.0
what's going on and roughly how it works

5955.76 --> 5959.52
so i was always eager to kind of look

5957.52 --> 5961.92
over the shoulder of programmers and

5959.52 --> 5964.159000000001
follow what they're doing and even ask

5961.92 --> 5967.119
them nag them like what is this what is

5964.159 --> 5970.96
that

5967.119 --> 5971.839999999999
but i didn't want to do it myself

5970.96 --> 5974.4800000000005
i just

5971.84 --> 5976.2390000000005
i was very dyslectic

5974.48 --> 5978.32
when it came to pro came to program and

5976.239 --> 5980.48
i did kind of try it a little bit like

5978.32 --> 5983.119
on my commuter 64 i went work with

5980.48 --> 5986.08
commodore basics super basic

5983.119 --> 5989.119
and it was like yeah i can sort of

5986.08 --> 5991.36
make a basic thing

5989.119 --> 5994.159
but yes it's super basic it's not going

5991.36 --> 5996.719
to be advanced or anything as soon as

5994.159 --> 5998.638999999999
like real serious coding came became

5996.719 --> 6000.88
involved

5998.639 --> 6003.119
or was needed for something i might ask

6000.88 --> 6005.119
my brother who knew not a lot more about

6003.119 --> 6006.639
commodore basic like oh do you know

6005.119 --> 6010.239
something for that

6006.639 --> 6010.2390000000005
a lot of the times he didn't even know

6010.32 --> 6014.799999999999
commodore 64 still works today yeah it

6012.48 --> 6016.718999999999
does it's a brilliant system and yeah

6014.8 --> 6017.92
it's very easy to emulate it on your

6016.719 --> 6019.52
computer

6017.92 --> 6024.96
you just build an emu like you can

6019.52 --> 6024.96
literally run a commodore 64. in your pc

6025.36 --> 6030.08
like

6027.44 --> 6034.5199999999995
it's so small

6030.08 --> 6034.5199999999995
it doesn't even take up any memory

6039.52 --> 6041.280000000001
like it

6040.56 --> 6043.280000000001
i

6041.28 --> 6045.599999999999
just wet finger work but i think like

6043.28 --> 6046.719
commodore 64 the amount of memory it

6045.6 --> 6049.1990000000005
requires

6046.719 --> 6050.88
would be typically like

6049.199 --> 6052.96
one

6050.88 --> 6055.76
hundred millionth

6052.96 --> 6059.199
or something of the amount of memory

6055.76 --> 6063.360000000001
that is typically used today

6059.199 --> 6068.199
like 100 millionth guys

6063.36 --> 6068.199
crazy but it is what it is

6080.159 --> 6083.199
all right

6081.679 --> 6087.32
okay i'm gonna have my last two minute

6083.199 --> 6087.32
break and then i'm gonna round out

6175.679 --> 6178.679
huh

6220.32 --> 6225.679
just get the all the attention

6222.56 --> 6225.679
uh so you're like

6225.76 --> 6231.320000000001
the lady from the i.t crowd

6228.32 --> 6231.32
brilliant

6242.639 --> 6245.639
uh

6260.639 --> 6265.6
i love the article so do i brilliant

6263.199 --> 6265.599999999999
stuff

6265.679 --> 6270.4800000000005
my only regret about it is that it's so

6268.8 --> 6273.28
short

6270.48 --> 6275.599999999999
with so few episodes but man was it

6273.28 --> 6280.32
awesome or what

6275.6 --> 6280.320000000001
not as crazy as her okay that's a relief

6286.08 --> 6290.159
yeah she's quite gorgeous i agree

6293.76 --> 6297.360000000001
anyway i am rounding out the show

6298.4 --> 6301.04
ah

6299.199 --> 6303.44
yeah it turned out

6301.04 --> 6305.5199999999995
great i feel a lot better now i think

6303.44 --> 6306.48
that the magnesium side trade really

6305.52 --> 6308.320000000001
helped

6306.48 --> 6310.799999999999
because after that point it just stopped

6308.32 --> 6312.239
rumbling down there

6310.8 --> 6314.639
so

6312.239 --> 6316.638999999999
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6314.639 --> 6319.04
liked this show it was interesting i

6316.639 --> 6321.1990000000005
think lots of music talk and

6319.04 --> 6323.679
ended up about computers and computer

6321.199 --> 6325.919999999999
programming

6323.679 --> 6325.92
uh

6328.48 --> 6334.959999999999
yeah also again thank you a lot robert

6332.719 --> 6337.119
for the paypal donation i hope somebody

6334.96 --> 6339.119
else will also

6337.119 --> 6342.159
take notice and

6339.119 --> 6344.239
and send me some

6342.159 --> 6347.199
that would be great but at least like

6344.239 --> 6349.44
i'm at least kind of out of the

6347.199 --> 6351.5199999999995
the most urgent woods

6349.44 --> 6353.04
that's a really weird way to say it but

6351.52 --> 6355.040000000001
anyway

6353.04 --> 6356.639
i'll be all right in the next few days

6355.04 --> 6359.36
thanks to that

6356.639 --> 6361.28
uh if you like this show

6359.36 --> 6363.679
then please don't forget to rogan's it

membership system join button they'll be

6379.84 --> 6384.96
much appreciated

6381.92 --> 6388.56
and thank you guys for all the support

6384.96 --> 6392.4
in presence and in finances it keeps the

6388.56 --> 6392.400000000001
early bird show and me going

6393.76 --> 6398.719
did you see the recap of your show

6397.52 --> 6399.76
i did

6398.719 --> 6402.639
what

6399.76 --> 6405.92
the recap of my show

6402.639 --> 6405.92
i don't know what you're talking about
