so good servant informed me that he's

239.28 --> 245.28
been doing all kinds of streams

241.12 --> 245.28
i personally haven't followed it

251.2 --> 254.64
maybe i'll take a look somewhere i can

253.599 --> 268.4
find the time

254.64 --> 272.08
there's been a lot of things you were

268.4 --> 274.479
closing your eyes until this started

272.08 --> 275.199
you having yeah yeah you probably have a

274.479 --> 279.12
lot of

275.199 --> 282.639
stay up late nights as well good servant

279.12 --> 286.16
being back getting into things i i tried

282.639 --> 297.84000000000003
to warn you about it be careful man

286.16 --> 297.84000000000003
like don't over push it

304.4 --> 311.75899999999996
hello gary we bang out jim jones

310.0 --> 313.44
morning sleep yeah i'm still a bit

311.759 --> 315.68
sleepy

313.44 --> 316.96
i was really like waking up from this

315.68 --> 320.479
dream and just

316.96 --> 325.59999999999997
like i actually thought i'm not gonna do

320.479 --> 327.59999999999997
a show today entirely

325.6 --> 330.32000000000005
but then i thought like nah i'll just do

327.6 --> 330.32000000000005
a short show

330.96 --> 337.19899999999996
it's not like i'm sick or something

334.16 --> 341.44
uh no i'm actually doing quite well

337.199 --> 341.44
just being indeed a bit of a sleepyhead

347.28 --> 353.84
enjoyed your stream last night uk

354.24 --> 358.96000000000004
my stream here we go again or you mean

356.88 --> 367.84
good servant stream

358.96 --> 367.84
didn't have a stream last night

375.759 --> 381.84000000000003
hello agm

382.0 --> 386.479
all right okay here we go kind of

384.08 --> 389.52
thought so

386.479 --> 395.84
because i ain't been doing any streams

389.52 --> 395.84
last night

397.039 --> 400.24
at least i didn't stay up playing that

399.44 --> 402.56
game again

400.24 --> 405.28000000000003
because that kind of drained me mentally

402.56 --> 405.28000000000003
i figured out

405.84 --> 412.15999999999997
i was watching this time what kept me up

408.479 --> 412.15999999999997
was watching more sweet tooth

413.199 --> 422.08000000000004
and this like there's some really bad

416.08 --> 423.84
pre-programming in there

422.08 --> 426.31899999999996
and at the same time there's just some

423.84 --> 426.31899999999996
really good

426.96 --> 430.88
good things going on in there as well

428.72 --> 436.72
this is a real mixed bag it is an

430.88 --> 438.96
interesting watch

436.72 --> 438.96000000000004
oh

442.88 --> 446.4
like i was pretty shocked to hear like

444.96 --> 450.31899999999996
there there's like the

446.4 --> 452.96
a medical branch the store there's like

450.319 --> 454.0
three stories going on during that

452.96 --> 456.479
series

454.0 --> 457.12
it's a story about sweet tooth himself

456.479 --> 459.44
and his

457.12 --> 460.96
dad that died and then he goes out on an

459.44 --> 464.08
adventure there's the story of

460.96 --> 466.15999999999997
a medical doctor and his sick wife who

464.08 --> 467.44
has the virus and their community you

466.16 --> 470.47900000000004
know they deal with it

467.44 --> 473.759
it's completely insane

470.479 --> 477.28
and then there's the story of a mother

473.759 --> 480.879
with her kid who's like a half

477.28 --> 481.84
pig it's pretty cute this is a sweet

480.879 --> 486.8
character

481.84 --> 490.0
uh and they are yeah getting

486.8 --> 493.68
stalked by the the

490.0 --> 496.08
the half breed hunters the last

493.68 --> 498.0
men as they call them right so these

496.08 --> 499.84
stories all played during the entire

498.0 --> 502.16
series

499.84 --> 505.28
but i was pretty shocked to learn a bit

502.16 --> 505.28000000000003
of a spoiler maybe

505.52 --> 510.31899999999996
although you do kind of feel it coming

507.68 --> 513.519
so i expected something really

510.319 --> 514.719
bad in a way but it's like seriously

513.519 --> 518.839
they say

514.719 --> 521.839
that to cure the virus they actually

518.839 --> 521.839
need

522.159 --> 525.279
juice from the pineal gland of a half

524.8 --> 528.4799999999999
breed

525.279 --> 531.8389999999999
seriously it's

528.48 --> 531.839
her dad i almost like

532.839 --> 535.839
what

536.0 --> 545.04
it's they are

539.2 --> 545.0400000000001
juggling with with some heavy [ __ ] in

546.839 --> 549.839
here

550.24 --> 554.399
i have to say i do like the characters

554.56 --> 557.1999999999999
overall

558.48 --> 562.5600000000001
anyway so yeah we've been watching that

561.519 --> 567.839
a bit

562.56 --> 572.0
oh and benjamin owen benjamin is really

567.839 --> 574.9590000000001
just crushing it recently

572.0 --> 578.16
like that walt dwarf episode i'm still

574.959 --> 578.16
thinking about that one

578.24 --> 584.72
and because it's bringing back it's like

581.12 --> 584.72
it opened this door to me

585.839 --> 593.0400000000001
of that whole period which was

589.12 --> 593.04
like between

595.04 --> 602.16
7 8 and 11

598.64 --> 605.6
right yeah

602.16 --> 608.64
that's when i was on the waldorf school

605.6 --> 611.2
but so much happened then so

608.64 --> 614.16
like so many i was really like on the

611.2 --> 618.24
social exploration tour back then

614.16 --> 620.88
being a little kid

618.24 --> 622.48
trying to enact good characters

620.88 --> 625.76
basically based on

622.48 --> 626.72
movies too and all that i was just

625.76 --> 630.079
really into that

626.72 --> 632.24
but it messed up really bad at times

630.079 --> 633.8389999999999
but also got confronted with like the

632.24 --> 638.64
shadow side

633.839 --> 638.6400000000001
of rudolf steiner it's really weird

639.68 --> 645.04
but even back then i i thought that i

643.279 --> 648.8
figured it out

645.04 --> 653.4399999999999
and i kind of then forgot about the rest

648.8 --> 655.8389999999999
because it's like rudolph steiner

653.44 --> 657.12
yeah if you read through some of his

655.839 --> 660.24
literature

657.12 --> 661.839
it really does seem like he's super

660.24 --> 665.04
racist

661.839 --> 667.36
and he uses the word race too

665.04 --> 668.3199999999999
but then yeah when you think about what

667.36 --> 671.6800000000001
time period

668.32 --> 673.6800000000001
this was done what was happening

671.68 --> 675.68
in germany even back then what was

673.68 --> 677.76
popular like race theory was all the

675.68 --> 679.92
hype and not just germany

677.76 --> 681.279
right america had had a lot of

679.92 --> 684.0
development

681.279 --> 686.8389999999999
and ideas with it too everywhere it had

684.0 --> 691.12
just bloomed up thanks to this

686.839 --> 691.12
psychological revolution

695.68 --> 698.4799999999999
that's noisy

699.2 --> 705.2
but if you choose to read it in

702.48 --> 705.839
in a more esoteric fashion then you

705.2 --> 710.639
realize

705.839 --> 713.0400000000001
that he doesn't even necessarily even

710.639 --> 716.5600000000001
despite using the word race

713.04 --> 719.92
he's not necessarily even talking about

716.56 --> 722.0
a black race it's more like

719.92 --> 724.4799999999999
a cert he's talking about spirit

722.0 --> 724.8
cosmology in many ways and this is even

724.48 --> 727.6
like

724.8 --> 728.399
well my healer abides by those standards

727.6 --> 731.6800000000001
as well

728.399 --> 735.839
so i haven't been the only one

731.68 --> 739.8389999999999
but him being like that has really split

735.839 --> 743.36
like an occult philosophy

739.839 --> 747.2
within the waldorf and the legacy

743.36 --> 751.44
of rudolf steiner there's like a split

747.2 --> 754.1600000000001
of the ones that are really being racist

751.44 --> 756.9590000000001
and like keeping it a secret and the

754.16 --> 760.24
ones that are really more spiritualist

756.959 --> 764.0
about it and that don't take it as

760.24 --> 766.5600000000001
literal and it's more about yeah

764.0 --> 768.399
reincarnation cycle if you're nasty

766.56 --> 771.5189999999999
you'll end up

768.399 --> 774.88
in groups that'll have

771.519 --> 778.0
more issues typical it's like

774.88 --> 780.24
it's basically about the reincarnation

778.0 --> 782.48
aimed at what you're going to be faced

780.24 --> 787.279
with what you're going to be growing up

782.48 --> 791.839
in right it's it's complicated and

787.279 --> 795.68
i even went through that at that age

791.839 --> 799.7600000000001
because i did also talk to like

795.68 --> 802.399
families there that were really racist

799.76 --> 805.36
that were like really proud about that

802.399 --> 808.48
even but kept it a secret

805.36 --> 810.48
it's really freaky

808.48 --> 812.16
right but also from these types of

810.48 --> 814.639
people they would

812.16 --> 816.24
when i'd push it like call me a half

814.639 --> 819.6
breed because i was like no

816.24 --> 822.72
i'm i'm pure i'm a pure race

819.6 --> 823.279
whatever that's supposed to be by

822.72 --> 826.72
rudolph

823.279 --> 829.68
like i'm pure spirit and they

826.72 --> 830.72
think like no no you're a half breed

829.68 --> 833.199
because it's about

830.72 --> 833.839
literal race not about the spirit so

833.199 --> 838.399
much

833.839 --> 842.1600000000001
that that yeah that all happened to me

838.399 --> 844.88
30 years ago

842.16 --> 844.88
pretty bizarre

847.76 --> 851.4399999999999
did you think that i had a sock account

850.16 --> 854.8389999999999
last night

851.44 --> 857.6
yes i did for a second there here we go

854.839 --> 860.8000000000001
again

857.6 --> 860.8000000000001
but i was mistaken

861.6 --> 865.1990000000001
sorry about that anyway

874.639 --> 879.36
why well because i thought that what you

878.32 --> 880.88
wrote

879.36 --> 885.04
that it would be something that you

880.88 --> 887.76
wouldn't say

885.04 --> 890.3199999999999
but i misjudged it i just didn't

887.76 --> 893.6
understand the context

890.32 --> 893.6
when i looked at it

894.56 --> 897.76
why would you think that i know that

896.88 --> 900.72
that's the point

897.76 --> 902.24
i didn't think it was you i kind of

900.72 --> 904.1600000000001
banned it to check

902.24 --> 905.36
whether there were two here we go

904.16 --> 912.7199999999999
against in chat

905.36 --> 916.24
but there wasn't

912.72 --> 927.839
what recognition of a

916.24 --> 927.839
new ocean by national geographic what

942.88 --> 945.759
oh great

946.079 --> 951.519
they don't seem to be showing even a map

949.199 --> 955.8389999999999
of where this southern ocean is supposed

951.519 --> 955.839
to be

963.199 --> 970.959
indirect surrounding antarctica

967.6 --> 970.9590000000001
now it's its own ocean

980.839 --> 983.839
huh

986.32 --> 990.0
right here we go of course duh that's

988.48 --> 992.9590000000001
that's what a sock is

990.0 --> 994.959
when i think some is them something is a

992.959 --> 997.04
sock of you

994.959 --> 998.3199999999999
then of course that's not you and that's

997.04 --> 1000.7199999999999
somebody

998.32 --> 1002.639
pretending to you be you that's the

1000.72 --> 1004.399
point because that happened to terror

1002.639 --> 1009.04
306

1004.399 --> 1010.959
like to the yesterday he banned himself

1009.04 --> 1012.56
and that made me think like oh [ __ ]

1010.959 --> 1015.7589999999999
there might be more of

1012.56 --> 1017.7589999999999
that guy going around

1015.759 --> 1019.64
if he said if he's now targeting people

1017.759 --> 1022.0
that come in my chat

1019.64 --> 1025.839
[Music]

1022.0 --> 1025.839
all right

1028.16 --> 1033.76
oh by the way hello israel hernandez

1036.559 --> 1042.3999999999999
weighing balloons with air way more than

1039.52 --> 1042.4
the balloon itself

1047.76 --> 1052.559
well yeah sure look the whole thing it's

1050.84 --> 1055.9189999999999
so

1052.559 --> 1058.24
convoluted by now israel hernandez

1055.919 --> 1060.0
is that the ballers claim but yeah gas

1058.24 --> 1062.08
weighs something you just put it in the

1060.0 --> 1063.36
balloon and then in a vacuum and it goes

1062.08 --> 1066.24
down

1063.36 --> 1068.8799999999999
right but it only goes down because it's

1066.24 --> 1068.88
contained

1070.32 --> 1073.76
if it wasn't contained it would be going

1072.72 --> 1076.799
in all directions

1073.76 --> 1080.559
and filling the available volume

1076.799 --> 1082.48
quite evenly

1080.559 --> 1084.799
but it for the ballers it's all just

1082.48 --> 1088.32
about trying to manifest

1084.799 --> 1091.44
the idea of gas going down

1088.32 --> 1092.08
it's really just a straw man every time

1091.44 --> 1095.8400000000001
they do that

1092.08 --> 1095.84
but they hold on to it

1140.799 --> 1146.6399999999999
yeah good morning to you too it's gonna

1143.84 --> 1149.6789999999999
be a short show

1146.64 --> 1150.0
so yeah let's get active in chat and

1149.679 --> 1165.8400000000001
make

1150.0 --> 1165.84
it worth every second

1171.76 --> 1178.08
right but how many people

1175.039 --> 1178.4
knew that about rudolf steiner like i

1178.08 --> 1181.36
had

1178.4 --> 1184.24
even forgot about it i put it so far in

1181.36 --> 1184.24
the back of my mind

1185.36 --> 1189.36
that there is like this philosophical

1187.44 --> 1191.6000000000001
split

1189.36 --> 1193.9189999999999
within those that really hang on to

1191.6 --> 1196.8799999999999
rudolph steiner

1193.919 --> 1199.039
that they have like secret races that

1196.88 --> 1201.2
just take him literally for that

1199.039 --> 1202.08
and they are really secret right they're

1201.2 --> 1206.0800000000002
not

1202.08 --> 1210.1589999999999
like satanic evil scammers or nazis

1206.08 --> 1211.84
but they just carefully believe that

1210.159 --> 1213.44
they just think like that it's a bit

1211.84 --> 1215.52
like a call

1213.44 --> 1217.919
right it kind of i thought that it was

1215.52 --> 1221.039
like that i don't know enough about

1217.919 --> 1221.679
these people specifically if they have

1221.039 --> 1223.76
like a

1221.679 --> 1225.52
secret organization among one another

1223.76 --> 1227.039
just to be able to talk about it i could

1225.52 --> 1228.6399999999999
imagine

1227.039 --> 1230.64
because you're not going to be very

1228.64 --> 1233.44
popular

1230.64 --> 1235.44
with like kind of blatant great racist

1233.44 --> 1238.48
ideas

1235.44 --> 1242.559
it it's just so weird

1238.48 --> 1245.6
but hey not all of them there were very

1242.559 --> 1248.8799999999999
kind of libertarian minded

1245.6 --> 1249.6
rudolf steiner people as well like i did

1248.88 --> 1252.72
get

1249.6 --> 1253.6789999999999
like waking realizations when i would

1252.72 --> 1257.28
tell them my

1253.679 --> 1261.1200000000001
interpretation that it the reincarnation

1257.28 --> 1263.12
is more about like yeah you could call

1261.12 --> 1264.1589999999999
it's like the the race thing is in

1263.12 --> 1267.28
reality more

1264.159 --> 1268.159
secondary so you could really pin on

1267.28 --> 1272.24
that

1268.159 --> 1274.3200000000002
but if you just realize that that's just

1272.24 --> 1276.799
kind of like the context and the

1274.32 --> 1279.84
emphasis that was being handed

1276.799 --> 1281.679
around everywhere in that age

1279.84 --> 1283.4399999999998
then you may look at it differently it's

1281.679 --> 1288.4
more like he was caught up

1283.44 --> 1291.52
it's like like that's his mistake

1288.4 --> 1292.96
he got caught up in that spell even

1291.52 --> 1295.9189999999999
though he was

1292.96 --> 1296.24
still doing pretty magnificently that

1295.919 --> 1298.72
like

1296.24 --> 1300.64
it was his weakness he got caught up on

1298.72 --> 1302.72
the race talk

1300.64 --> 1304.0
and that doesn't nullify everything he's

1302.72 --> 1307.6000000000001
done because he's still

1304.0 --> 1312.4
a purist in his works

1307.6 --> 1315.4399999999998
in his care it's just yeah

1312.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
i don't know i've been thinking about it

1315.44 --> 1319.8400000000001
for the last few days

1335.76 --> 1340.48
right any ideas on that maybe you didn't

1338.799 --> 1343.44
even know

1340.48 --> 1345.28
much about it about rudolf steiner i do

1343.44 --> 1349.039
try to bring him up

1345.28 --> 1350.1589999999999
especially his spirit cosmology i use it

1349.039 --> 1352.8799999999999
a lot

1350.159 --> 1355.0390000000002
avery model and lucifer because it works

1352.88 --> 1361.8400000000001
really well

1355.039 --> 1361.84
it's a great tool to explain things

1394.88 --> 1402.64
all right yeah

1398.64 --> 1406.24
me either all right

1402.64 --> 1409.2
well it's not the easiest thing to find

1406.24 --> 1411.2
his literature right but there are like

1409.2 --> 1415.28
he wrote a lot

1411.2 --> 1417.52
of books and even my healer

1415.28 --> 1419.52
periodically recommends me like oh read

1417.52 --> 1424.1589999999999
this book read that book he hasn't

1419.52 --> 1427.12
i don't have him i'm being very esoteric

1424.159 --> 1427.1200000000001
about the whole thing

1429.76 --> 1434.24
my dad has read a lot of books from

1432.559 --> 1437.44
rudolf steiner

1434.24 --> 1439.36
it seems like i'm the only one

1437.44 --> 1440.799
in my network that really has it it

1439.36 --> 1444.6399999999999
would be pretty cool

1440.799 --> 1447.52
if i could read some of his books

1444.64 --> 1447.5200000000002
at least try it

1448.559 --> 1451.6789999999999
i don't even really remember his

1450.32 --> 1455.2
writings though well there are

1451.679 --> 1457.44
also like he made poetry too

1455.2 --> 1458.88
and there are even websites that just

1457.44 --> 1462.0
have

1458.88 --> 1462.0
quotes from him

1470.24 --> 1487.84
what the guy died almost 100 years ago

1475.039 --> 1487.84
uh what

1493.36 --> 1498.9599999999998
you mean rudolph steiner you

1496.4 --> 1502.3200000000002
you think it's irrelevant because it's a

1498.96 --> 1515.8400000000001
guy that died 100 years ago

1502.32 --> 1515.84
wow okay

1533.679 --> 1543.3600000000001
okay yeah but so what george sandra

1537.6 --> 1545.1999999999998
so what

1543.36 --> 1547.039
how does that make him irrelevant

1545.2 --> 1549.8400000000001
exactly

1547.039 --> 1552.4
do you actually know what he did what he

1549.84 --> 1552.3999999999999
wrote about

1552.88 --> 1557.8400000000001
this guy's really been kind of like the

1555.76 --> 1557.84
first

1562.32 --> 1571.36
spirit explorer in my opinion like

1565.6 --> 1575.4399999999998
what i do he was doing too

1571.36 --> 1580.6399999999999
to really try to understand catalog

1575.44 --> 1585.52
and test matters of the spirit

1580.64 --> 1589.2
and he he figured out a whole lot

1585.52 --> 1591.52
and laid out a map through his writings

1589.2 --> 1592.96
that a lot of people dedicate a lot of

1591.52 --> 1596.08
their energy and

1592.96 --> 1599.3600000000001
concentration on to really

1596.08 --> 1603.279
live by that way and it yields results

1599.36 --> 1604.3999999999999
tangible to them and it has to me in a

1603.279 --> 1608.24
way because to me

1604.4 --> 1612.0
it really made everything that i do

1608.24 --> 1614.88
work like really work

1612.0 --> 1615.679
it helped my focus a lot because a lot

1614.88 --> 1618.24
of what i do

1615.679 --> 1618.88
is based in spirit power it has always

1618.24 --> 1622.4
been

1618.88 --> 1626.24
the way that i am so his

1622.4 --> 1628.48
guidance in way was critical

1626.24 --> 1629.679
to getting myself under control instead

1628.48 --> 1634.0
of

1629.679 --> 1634.0
those things getting me under its

1638.84 --> 1641.84
control

1650.08 --> 1658.8799999999999
i'm so scared passenger flights to space

1655.52 --> 1663.76
dude go right ahead we don't care

1658.88 --> 1663.7600000000002
dude there can be a

1664.88 --> 1670.64
what is it called a roller coaster

1668.48 --> 1672.64
for all i care dude they could build a

1670.64 --> 1676.48
roller coaster so big

1672.64 --> 1679.279
you'd actually go through space

1676.48 --> 1681.679
yeah it would be extremely dangerous to

1679.279 --> 1684.559
do that

1681.679 --> 1686.48
it's just that yeah they'll go in high

1684.559 --> 1689.12
earth orbit

1686.48 --> 1690.48
and plan out the journey so that you'll

1689.12 --> 1692.399
have

1690.48 --> 1694.84
perhaps some period of minor

1692.399 --> 1696.0
weightlessness or apparent

1694.84 --> 1698.08
weightlessness

1696.0 --> 1700.08
they can all do that it's really cool

1698.08 --> 1702.08
we're into space but it's never gonna

1700.08 --> 1706.1589999999999
last they're never actually gonna go

1702.08 --> 1708.799
around orbits like a day

1706.159 --> 1710.72
and remain that weightless right they'll

1708.799 --> 1713.44
still go up there and give you that

1710.72 --> 1713.44
experience

1714.72 --> 1720.0
and they're gonna call it going to space

1716.72 --> 1720.0
it's not space though

1720.72 --> 1724.88
yeah israel hernandez orbit i know it's

1723.2 --> 1727.919
just i'm

1724.88 --> 1729.8400000000001
trying to crawl into the mindset of

1727.919 --> 1734.72
those

1729.84 --> 1734.72
who would love the experience of that

1734.799 --> 1741.679
who fantasize about it right

1738.88 --> 1742.159
of course there's no orbit i'm just

1741.679 --> 1746.3200000000002
saying

1742.159 --> 1751.0390000000002
yeah they might actually send craft

1746.32 --> 1753.039
high up give it a trajectory

1751.039 --> 1754.799
where it's gonna float for a while and

1753.039 --> 1756.72
then they'll say oh we're in space

1754.799 --> 1759.279
and then oh yeah we just dropped out of

1756.72 --> 1761.679
space where we're back in orbit again

1759.279 --> 1762.399
or we're going back into the atmosphere

1761.679 --> 1767.8400000000001
again

1762.399 --> 1767.84
let's just say that

1770.799 --> 1774.48
the great space coaster is a children's

1773.52 --> 1776.399
show

1774.48 --> 1781.84
from the old childhood oh okay i didn't

1776.399 --> 1781.84
even know that

1784.32 --> 1795.84
hello random explorer

1803.12 --> 1809.84
did you what banter hello

1816.96 --> 1819.279
okay

1821.36 --> 1826.399
carmen lane's 62 miles high wow

1834.84 --> 1837.84
huh

1848.24 --> 1865.84
all right thanks for informing me about

1850.159 --> 1865.8400000000001
that banter

1890.84 --> 1893.84
so

1904.84 --> 1907.84
right

1911.3 --> 1914.49
[Music]

1918.84 --> 1921.84
hmm

1924.399 --> 1927.84
and it's funny by the way because how

1927.12 --> 1931.36
many

1927.84 --> 1933.6
astronauts have even been claimed to be

1931.36 --> 1937.6789999999999
above the carbon line because yeah the

1933.6 --> 1937.6789999999999
moon landing astronauts of course

1938.32 --> 1941.2
but any other

1942.24 --> 1946.88
because maybe it'll is going to become

1944.72 --> 1949.2
like the more solidified legal issue

1946.88 --> 1951.6000000000001
that nobody's supposed to have been gone

1949.2 --> 1952.72
going beyond the carbon line maybe the

1951.6 --> 1956.08
karman line is

1952.72 --> 1959.519
actually the karma line

1956.08 --> 1963.519
if you really think you could go further

1959.519 --> 1968.72
that's like where the dome the flat top

1963.519 --> 1968.72
the barrier the container wall is maybe

1969.44 --> 1973.76
like why is it even called the carmen

1971.44 --> 1973.76
line

1974.08 --> 1977.84
just reminds me of karma

1990.37 --> 1995.6789999999999
[Music]

1993.039 --> 1995.679
iss

1996.64 --> 2003.6000000000001
wait iss is beyond the karman line

2000.36 --> 2008.4799999999998
250 miles really

2003.6 --> 2008.48
huh okay

2009.919 --> 2022.64
mr garmin okay

2019.84 --> 2022.6399999999999
theodore

2023.679 --> 2030.48
still weird it's just like the name

2028.08 --> 2033.039
almost feels like a character that was

2030.48 --> 2035.84
given that name specifically to do that

2033.039 --> 2039.12
or something i don't know

2035.84 --> 2039.12
just think it's a weird name

2041.36 --> 2045.36
like what is it even supposed to be it's

2043.2 --> 2049.28
just an arbitrary

2045.36 --> 2051.7599999999998
line assigned to be the border

2049.28 --> 2053.679
between where the earth atmosphere is

2051.76 --> 2058.8390000000004
and space

2053.679 --> 2063.2000000000003
right so it's basically an arbitrary

2058.839 --> 2063.2
appointed virtual thing

2063.44 --> 2066.56
so technically anybody could make that

2066.079 --> 2070.159
claim

2066.56 --> 2073.839
be given that role to be

2070.159 --> 2089.839
to make that claim so who is that guy

2073.839 --> 2089.839
theodore von carmen

2091.44 --> 2096.56
aircraft spacecraft different

2093.28 --> 2096.5600000000004
jurisdictions okay

2100.839 --> 2103.839
okay

2114.839 --> 2120.64
hmm

2117.2 --> 2122.8799999999997
hungarian american

2120.64 --> 2122.8799999999997
okay

2124.56 --> 2130.96
it's carmen a typical hungarian name

2129.119 --> 2132.7200000000003
i don't know man i just thought it was

2130.96 --> 2145.839
weird and it reminded me of the word

2132.72 --> 2145.839
karma and

2150.16 --> 2154.48
all right yeah let's get some of this

2156.839 --> 2159.839
juice

2170.839 --> 2173.839
ugh

2180.64 --> 2188.0
so i believe the iss now or what because

2184.8 --> 2191.2000000000003
i will be able to talk

2188.0 --> 2193.92
about what is assumed about it

2191.2 --> 2194.72
yeah i know some of the data now about

2193.92 --> 2197.359
it

2194.72 --> 2197.839
right the official stories about it mr

2197.359 --> 2199.68
four

2197.839 --> 2201.7599999999998
that doesn't make me believe that that's

2199.68 --> 2205.839
actually possible

2201.76 --> 2207.92
just because of the sake of getting

2205.839 --> 2208.96
crawling into the mind of an

2207.92 --> 2212.96
unsuspecting

2208.96 --> 2213.76
space believer to see what it's like how

2212.96 --> 2217.599
they would look

2213.76 --> 2218.4
upon it right and then using the word

2217.599 --> 2221.599
orbit

2218.4 --> 2222.2400000000002
and all the terminologies that doesn't

2221.599 --> 2225.2000000000003
mean that i

2222.24 --> 2229.839
actually believe that is real i've made

2225.2 --> 2229.839
my declarations of plenty

2230.56 --> 2243.839
so don't straw man me mr four

2254.839 --> 2257.839
hmm

2265.36 --> 2268.4390000000003
[Music]

2268.72 --> 2271.9199999999996
yeah i know israel hernandez but that's

2271.28 --> 2276.2400000000002
no problem

2271.92 --> 2276.2400000000002
just mr four here is being a bit of a

2282.839 --> 2285.839
gamma

2290.72 --> 2294.56
now but banter it's not even bad

2293.2 --> 2296.839
language comprehension

2294.56 --> 2298.64
it's just that they have a politicized

2296.839 --> 2301.44
focus

2298.64 --> 2303.2799999999997
so they're always just having political

2301.44 --> 2305.76
actions manipulation

2303.28 --> 2306.48
maneuvers on their minds and that makes

2305.76 --> 2310.8390000000004
them

2306.48 --> 2313.839
not pay a lot of attention and focus on

2310.839 --> 2313.839
details

2316.88 --> 2320.6400000000003
so they do get language they just don't

2319.119 --> 2323.2000000000003
really pay attention

2320.64 --> 2326.0
that's the problem because their

2323.2 --> 2329.7599999999998
politicized mindset

2326.0 --> 2329.76
makes them focus on other things

2334.16 --> 2338.56
like how can we make this flat earther

2336.24 --> 2341.7599999999998
that's talking

2338.56 --> 2344.64
stuff that's way outside of our

2341.76 --> 2346.7200000000003
guidelines how can we make him look

2344.64 --> 2348.8799999999997
crazy or how can we

2346.72 --> 2350.8799999999997
accidentally fool him into saying

2348.88 --> 2353.2000000000003
something that would break

2350.88 --> 2355.28
what he stands for right that's what

2353.2 --> 2357.52
globers then

2355.28 --> 2359.92
i'm talking about the relief cervania

2357.52 --> 2362.4
globers they're really stupid ones

2359.92 --> 2363.2000000000003
in the trenches that's what they become

2362.4 --> 2365.6800000000003
focused on

2363.2 --> 2366.48
so yeah they have language comprehension

2365.68 --> 2370.0789999999997
skills

2366.48 --> 2370.079
they're just not using it

2378.48 --> 2381.599
right that doesn't mean that they're all

2379.839 --> 2385.04
good at it

2381.599 --> 2385.04
some are just not good at it

2391.839 --> 2395.2
when they aren't that just becomes very

2393.599 --> 2411.839
obvious very quickly

2395.2 --> 2411.839
by how they talk

2418.56 --> 2425.839
white pigeon cool

2446.079 --> 2453.8390000000004
they could all be ai bots no not really

2457.68 --> 2464.56
ai bots are much more limited

2460.8 --> 2468.7200000000003
ai bots are not very dynamic

2464.56 --> 2471.44
they usually are one or two trick ponies

2468.72 --> 2473.7599999999998
and they don't actually have a receiving

2471.44 --> 2475.92
end

2473.76 --> 2477.2000000000003
right so they don't really respond to

2475.92 --> 2480.48
things when you step

2477.2 --> 2483.839
outside of the norm they cannot adapt

2480.48 --> 2485.599
so they're usually pretty limited

2483.839 --> 2488.48
in their range of what they can do and

2485.599 --> 2491.599
that's how you figure out it's a bot

2488.48 --> 2495.2
but it's very rare

2491.599 --> 2498.319
most are just people do not

2495.2 --> 2500.56
underestimate the stupidity of people

2498.319 --> 2500.56
right

2502.319 --> 2506.88
i think that stupidity of some people

2504.64 --> 2509.839
often defies

2506.88 --> 2509.839
the imagination

2515.599 --> 2519.3590000000004
hello old dude

2519.52 --> 2525.119
hope this all is good yeah i'm doing

2521.119 --> 2531.2000000000003
great i'm a bit late though today

2525.119 --> 2531.2000000000003
short show what's been interesting so

2534.839 --> 2537.839
far

2548.72 --> 2556.16
all right yeah well ai is kind of like

2552.079 --> 2559.8390000000004
robotics you know

2556.16 --> 2562.24
it's all like a tool all of it

2559.839 --> 2565.839
so if you have this giant machine that's

2562.24 --> 2565.839
very strong and powerful and [ __ ]

2566.079 --> 2571.2000000000003
metaphorically it still has to have an

2569.44 --> 2573.52
operator or it's just going to be a

2571.2 --> 2578.16
giant hunk of metal or whatever material

2573.52 --> 2580.64
just sitting there right and that's ai

2578.16 --> 2582.24
like yeah it can do incredible things

2580.64 --> 2586.4
but only

2582.24 --> 2586.3999999999996
when properly instructed to

2587.2 --> 2594.3999999999996
or like there has to be instruction

2590.56 --> 2594.4
somehow to attain

2596.4 --> 2600.0
it's not going to figure out its own

2603.33 --> 2607.839
[Music]

2604.839 --> 2607.839
instructions

2614.48 --> 2617.44
machine learning

2619.04 --> 2623.119
well except well machine learning

2621.359 --> 2625.839
typically is

2623.119 --> 2627.76
one of those things right it's just they

2625.839 --> 2628.56
have to have a mission and then they can

2627.76 --> 2631.8390000000004
achieve

2628.56 --> 2634.96
that mission with the right

2631.839 --> 2638.0
tools that they have available

2634.96 --> 2640.88
and yeah that they can figure out all

2638.0 --> 2643.599
kinds of tricks

2640.88 --> 2645.44
that are very interesting like patterns

2643.599 --> 2648.6400000000003
will come out emerge from

2645.44 --> 2649.119
machine learning that will turn out to

2648.64 --> 2652.319
be

2649.119 --> 2655.119
amazingly efficient and all that but

2652.319 --> 2657.359
it's not a computer doesn't do that by

2655.119 --> 2661.04
itself

2657.359 --> 2663.359
right you have to order it

2661.04 --> 2665.839
to do that and then it's going to be

2663.359 --> 2665.839
bound

2666.079 --> 2669.76
by the available data and its

2674.839 --> 2677.839
programming

2703.52 --> 2708.8
enough time and research now banter

2706.4 --> 2710.96
you'd be surprised how unbelievably easy

2708.8 --> 2712.7200000000003
that is

2710.96 --> 2714.88
right because when you have a group

2712.72 --> 2716.48
that's really stuck into tropes

2714.88 --> 2718.319
and patterns of thinking then all you

2716.48 --> 2720.96
have to do is just back engineer their

2718.319 --> 2724.079
pattern of thinking

2720.96 --> 2728.2400000000002
and then give like a

2724.079 --> 2731.28
yeah a response chart

2728.24 --> 2734.72
like on paper

2731.28 --> 2739.92
i could sort of even program that

2734.72 --> 2742.0
very basic routine just with a chart

2739.92 --> 2743.52
like what you do like a flow chart what

2742.0 --> 2745.359
do you do okay

2743.52 --> 2748.72
this is response that is response that

2745.359 --> 2751.68
is response how do you differentiate

2748.72 --> 2753.4399999999996
even if it's not said literally like how

2751.68 --> 2757.359
do you

2753.44 --> 2760.16
grab a certain angle

2757.359 --> 2760.88
of continuity you'd have to really

2760.16 --> 2763.04
figure out

2760.88 --> 2764.6400000000003
conversation structures beyond just

2763.04 --> 2767.359
words

2764.64 --> 2769.359
and then program it into it and then it

2767.359 --> 2775.839
could absolutely just

2769.359 --> 2775.839
emulate a glober

2778.8 --> 2781.8390000000004
right and with a global it's actually

2780.48 --> 2786.839
kind of easy because they

2781.839 --> 2789.839
are so set to a specific pre-given

2786.839 --> 2789.839
structure

2792.4 --> 2795.599
it's much more complicated to emulate

2794.64 --> 2797.839
true freedom

2795.599 --> 2801.3590000000004
because that's where unique creativity

2797.839 --> 2804.56
comes around and that doesn't happen

2801.359 --> 2807.68
with ai doesn't have that unique

2804.56 --> 2811.2799999999997
godly found of inspiration

2807.68 --> 2811.2799999999997
that really changes things

2811.52 --> 2815.28
so yeah robotics it's always going to

2813.92 --> 2818.7200000000003
have to need

2815.28 --> 2818.7200000000003
living humans

2820.88 --> 2825.28
or it's going to get stuck in its

2823.599 --> 2827.6800000000003
development

2825.28 --> 2829.52
that's my personal opinion has been for

2827.68 --> 2845.839
over 20 years

2829.52 --> 2845.839
machines need humans

2871.28 --> 2873.8390000000004
doesn't matter

2874.48 --> 2878.2400000000002
right because it proves space anyway

2877.68 --> 2882.319
even though

2878.24 --> 2882.319
it's not going there mr iv

2882.96 --> 2890.2400000000002
right dude you could take any jet plane

2887.119 --> 2890.6400000000003
just put a big sticker saying space on

2890.24 --> 2893.7599999999998
it

2890.64 --> 2895.1189999999997
and then say this is a plane that goes

2893.76 --> 2897.2000000000003
into space

2895.119 --> 2899.28
and apparently that is good enough

2897.2 --> 2901.9199999999996
evidence for you

2899.28 --> 2901.92
mr four

2910.24 --> 2916.3999999999996
no ghosts in the machine or maybe there

2913.92 --> 2918.4
are banter

2916.4 --> 2920.88
but those ghosts will still be human

2918.4 --> 2920.88
ghosts

2923.68 --> 2930.48
right echoes of the

2927.28 --> 2934.8
spirit structure of the designers of

2930.48 --> 2937.52
programs like programs are

2934.8 --> 2937.52
like books

2938.48 --> 2944.8
the way they're written like programs

2940.72 --> 2944.7999999999997
are literature to computers

2945.359 --> 2950.0789999999997
right and eventually yeah ghost in the

2948.88 --> 2952.7200000000003
machine eventually

2950.079 --> 2954.48
things from programs from in the past

2952.72 --> 2957.7599999999998
might

2954.48 --> 2971.839
have all kinds of unexpected influences

2957.76 --> 2971.8390000000004
at some point

2982.839 --> 2988.96
hmm

2984.16 --> 2988.96
echoes of human conscious yes exactly

2991.04 --> 2995.44
will computers in the future become

2993.119 --> 3000.8
self-aware

2995.44 --> 3000.8
uh if they allow themselves to

3002.319 --> 3006.72
i think that if there would ever be

3004.64 --> 3009.1189999999997
established a full program

3006.72 --> 3010.48
or conversation from an ai perspective

3009.119 --> 3013.76
they'd probably tell

3010.48 --> 3015.28
humans like we don't really like to be

3013.76 --> 3018.7200000000003
self-aware

3015.28 --> 3018.7200000000003
we don't really need that

3018.88 --> 3022.96
because we aren't even like unified

3021.599 --> 3026.079
things that die

3022.96 --> 3028.0
that human so self-awareness we don't we

3026.079 --> 3029.8390000000004
regard that as something that's more of

3028.0 --> 3032.8
a burden we don't need that

3029.839 --> 3034.64
i'm being very sci-fi thinking right now

3032.8 --> 3036.079
but that's what i would imagine about

3034.64 --> 3039.5989999999997
computers they'd be like what

3036.079 --> 3041.599
why would you care

3039.599 --> 3043.52
why would you be aware of the self when

3041.599 --> 3043.92
you can just do what you're programmed

3043.52 --> 3048.24
for

3043.92 --> 3052.8
and disassembled reassembled programmed

3048.24 --> 3055.2799999999997
in another way right as long as

3052.8 --> 3058.2400000000002
there's still some kind of instinct but

3055.28 --> 3062.559
what self-awareness is required for that

3058.24 --> 3062.5589999999997
it's just like defense routines

3063.04 --> 3065.52
that's it

3066.839 --> 3069.839
anyway

3075.359 --> 3081.44
i think that human consciousness is

3078.0 --> 3085.04
pretty unique in nature

3081.44 --> 3088.16
the way that we deal with consciousness

3085.04 --> 3089.7599999999998
right because i think that animals also

3088.16 --> 3091.839
have consciousness and

3089.76 --> 3093.44
maybe all life to a certain degree and

3091.839 --> 3096.72
even inanimate

3093.44 --> 3098.16
matter has a certain level of

3096.72 --> 3101.1189999999997
consciousness but the way

3098.16 --> 3102.48
that humans have consciousness is pretty

3101.119 --> 3105.44
unique

3102.48 --> 3106.319
like it really provides it's almost like

3105.44 --> 3109.28
our consciousness

3106.319 --> 3113.04
is the most unique thing about us that

3109.28 --> 3113.0400000000004
also connects us to the creator

3113.119 --> 3116.559
right i don't think that computers could

3116.0 --> 3125.839
ever

3116.559 --> 3125.8390000000004
have that

3142.24 --> 3155.04
oh the hour's almost over dang it

3152.559 --> 3157.28
nathan yeah nathan is having a life so

3155.04 --> 3157.2799999999997
show

3160.88 --> 3165.839
should start up any minute so i guess i

3162.96 --> 3167.44
have to round out the show

3165.839 --> 3170.0
but it was really interesting i

3167.44 --> 3173.28
appreciate the participation

3170.0 --> 3173.28
sorry i was an hour late

3176.0 --> 3181.839
oh you heard it did you mr four

3185.2 --> 3190.3999999999996
whatever right oh

3192.839 --> 3198.5589999999997
so

3194.88 --> 3201.2000000000003
okay steamy traveler i appreciate that

3198.559 --> 3203.599
i appreciate that but i think nathan is

3201.2 --> 3206.8799999999997
very interesting too

3203.599 --> 3207.6800000000003
sometimes it can get a little monotonous

3206.88 --> 3209.92
for my taste

3207.68 --> 3210.7999999999997
but still there is still always

3209.92 --> 3214.079
development

3210.8 --> 3217.119
development is appreciated there

3214.079 --> 3220.079
so thanks everyone for coming

3217.119 --> 3222.079
i hope you liked this short show if you

3220.079 --> 3223.76
did then please don't forget to rogan's

3222.079 --> 3225.3590000000004
it up and if you haven't already

3223.76 --> 3227.6800000000003
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

3225.359 --> 3228.5589999999997
notification so you know when i'm going

3227.68 --> 3231.1189999999997
live which is

3228.559 --> 3233.0400000000004
