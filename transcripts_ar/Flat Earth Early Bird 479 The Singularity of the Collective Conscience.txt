today weather is sunny there's a lot of

83.49 --> 91.05
oh I guess you think chemtrails but it

89.01 --> 94.35000000000001
could also simply be kind of like dust

91.05 --> 99.869
clouds I don't really see typical spray

94.35 --> 102.77
patterns at all so I don't know if it's

99.869 --> 105.99
chemtrails or to something else but

102.77 --> 109.59
besides that it seems to be very clear

105.99 --> 110.83999999999999
and very sunny no wind it's really nice

109.59 --> 118.45
and warm outside

I hope I didn't forget anyone I don't

179.41 --> 186.97
think so

180.28 --> 190.03
so yeah been up late last night very

186.97 --> 194.74
very late it's all kinds of things

190.03 --> 197.83
keeping me busy my mother's the phone

194.74 --> 199.78
call with my friend and I'm a again she

197.83 --> 201.85000000000002
had a lot to get off her chest it's a

199.78 --> 205.66
good conversation it did last like three

201.85 --> 210.57999999999998
and a half hours though but yeah she

205.66 --> 213.1
needed it and it was good although I

210.58 --> 215.14000000000001
didn't miss out on like the evening part

213.1 --> 225.84
a lot but yeah there was still plenty

215.14 --> 225.83999999999997
around on YouTube and D life watch again

231.66 --> 241.24
mmm I know I watch the Owen Benjamin

236.44 --> 243.34
again a good like piano session that was

241.24 --> 245.98000000000002
nice

243.34 --> 249.13
you might have had a stream later later

245.98 --> 252.069
in the evening for him but yeah already

249.13 --> 258.54
went to bed back by that time I don't

252.069 --> 258.53999999999996
know see what else

269.449 --> 276.77000000000004
I know I'll get to it the event was

274.479 --> 279.86
anyway yeah it was weird to there and

276.77 --> 282.04999999999995
went out for some groceries and then

279.86 --> 284.3
found out that apparently now yeah my

282.05 --> 287.839
favorite coffee shop apparently was just

284.3 --> 289.699
not open was weird I presume it was due

287.839 --> 292.43
to the corona virus although it didn't

289.699 --> 293.21000000000004
have any sign like yeah we're closed now

292.43 --> 295.099
it's worse

293.21 --> 298.039
it was just closed so that was kind of

295.099 --> 300.219
annoying I wonder if they're gonna keep

298.039 --> 302.509
that up for like the next week or so so

300.219 --> 306.189
I'll just have to check out some other

302.509 --> 308.509
coffee shops the next time I go out

306.189 --> 311.509
they're not I'm pretty sure they're not

308.509 --> 320.509
all closed but yeah it is a bit of a

311.509 --> 324.68
hassle and for that you know yeah

320.509 --> 326.689
I've been hearing some rude news

324.68 --> 329.149
channels and Dutch things that

326.689 --> 334.66900000000004
apparently there's this political issue

329.149 --> 337.49
now going on with right versus left like

334.669 --> 340.24899999999997
we should close down for the coronavirus

337.49 --> 344.27
a lot of things let it pass over and

340.249 --> 345.68
left it's like no no we shouldn't but I

344.27 --> 347.539
don't know it's messy

345.68 --> 350.93
I don't even keep close track of what's

347.539 --> 353.349
going on in the Dutch politics so

350.93 --> 356.689
usually get just some side information

353.349 --> 358.37
after things have happened already but

356.689 --> 360.379
that seems to be going on it's like the

358.37 --> 363.83
whole new theme that apparently right

360.379 --> 367.37
once it all closed down and left wants

363.83 --> 371.889
to keep it all open and then the

367.37 --> 371.889
conspiracy theories and Sue as to why

376.41 --> 380.97900000000004
[Music]

384.599 --> 387.599
okay

388.48 --> 397.05
I think we gotta

391.81 --> 407.32
oh alright someone like that you know

397.05 --> 412.65000000000003
yeah nobody needs that teams team

407.32 --> 414.93
skeptic is it's an absolute buffoon and

412.65 --> 419.62
so are you

414.93 --> 421.83
mmm at mr. bozo head blatantly obvious

419.62 --> 421.83
Oh

422.26 --> 427.95
calls himself there it's just [ __ ]

424.54 --> 427.95000000000005
on purpose

430.26 --> 433.3
[Music]

437.4 --> 443.94
what will they do the next lose a season

440.01 --> 451.139
well what they do every year

443.94 --> 455.49
101 raw count take over the world but I

451.139 --> 458.1
think this I don't know exactly if it if

455.49 --> 460.74
it would but if like the the setting of

458.1 --> 462.93
what's going on continues something like

460.74 --> 466.71000000000004
this could potentially happen like every

462.93 --> 469.71
year from now on it'll be the new yeah

466.71 --> 474.75
state driven busying therapy during flu

469.71 --> 482.729
season yeah the compartmentalization and

474.75 --> 485.25
shutting down game ensues yeah but you

482.729 --> 489.21
know the whole situation is such a mixed

485.25 --> 491.07
bag because on one hand it's like oh but

489.21 --> 494.21999999999997
you're shutting down the economy and

491.07 --> 498.06
it's bad and yeah that's that is there

494.22 --> 501.27000000000004
of course but at the same time it is flu

498.06 --> 506.7
season people do typically get sick and

501.27 --> 509.58
it's a fact practically that yeah when

506.7 --> 515.669
you get sick or sickish if you just take

509.58 --> 519.779
it easy and yeah yeah don't overexert

515.669 --> 522.959
yourself you restore a lot better so

519.779 --> 526.11
yeah there is also something positive to

522.959 --> 527.8499999999999
be said for the closed-down strategy as

526.11 --> 531.57
long as it doesn't take too long

527.85 --> 536.1
as long as you just make it last eight a

531.57 --> 538.2600000000001
typical getting over the flu period

536.1 --> 541.529
which would be I guess two weeks on

538.26 --> 543.51
average I don't know it's old it's a

541.529 --> 548.57
giant mixed bag of what's going on it

543.51 --> 548.5699999999999
just seems to me mostly like

549.36 --> 555.629
if while they've always been trying to

552.779 --> 557.61
hype up flu fears you know even yeah

555.629 --> 559.139
with the to get your vaccine and all

557.61 --> 561.629
that nonsense that's been going on

559.139 --> 566.279
forever for twenty years it's a bad

561.629 --> 569.6700000000001
situation but now it just seems like

566.279 --> 572.1
okay government has to get involved now

569.67 --> 574.679
a lot and because of economy because of

572.1 --> 577.4590000000001
whatever because people are scared

574.679 --> 580.41
because they are being made scared and

577.459 --> 585.1099999999999
well if they just left it alone like

580.41 --> 588.449
they pretty much always have I know

585.11 --> 590.519
wouldn't it just naturally naturally

588.449 --> 593.279
resolve in people would just say like Oh

590.519 --> 596.79
flu is going around okay yeah that's

593.279 --> 598.619
just what it is nothing to really worry

596.79 --> 601.3499999999999
about but if you get sick then you

598.619 --> 604.1700000000001
should probably just stay home and and

601.35 --> 609.9490000000001
sick it out and and back to business as

604.17 --> 615.29
usual so you know it's just different

609.949 --> 615.29
it's just different that seems to be it

621.33 --> 630.3000000000001
[Music]

626.75 --> 632.399
but yeah in a way you know because of

630.3 --> 637.05
the timing you'd wonder if one could

632.399 --> 639.06
consider with spring seeming we around

637.05 --> 642.66
the corner the wedding the nice weather

639.06 --> 644.569
again already being here I don't think

642.66 --> 647.189
it's a bad idea to close down schools

644.569 --> 649.3789999999999
because it'll give it's some good

647.189 --> 652.23
opportunity to not be focused on

649.379 --> 653.939
indoctrination as Owen Benjamin says it

652.23 --> 656.519
and there's a lot to that especially in

653.939 --> 660.7199999999999
the Netherlands unfortunately and just

656.519 --> 662.67
go and play outside and fool around in

660.72 --> 665.879
the dirt and all that which is very

662.67 --> 668.93
healthy hands in the dirt getting it all

665.879 --> 671.519
over you rolling in mud like a pig is

668.93 --> 673.079
actually really really healthy as long

671.519 --> 677.54
as you don't do it in any kind of

673.079 --> 680.1289999999999
polluted ground or anything you know so

677.54 --> 682.949
yeah it's good it's actually better for

680.129 --> 686.61
the health of kids if if they are not

682.949 --> 690.6289999999999
always locked into some box with a lot

686.61 --> 692.5500000000001
of other kids being forced yeah being

690.629 --> 695.79
force-fed certain information that they

692.55 --> 700.949
have to take as is and instead just fool

695.79 --> 704.129
around move unabated and yeah let their

700.949 --> 707.67
imagination go wild a bit and just play

704.129 --> 711.089
outside it's actually very healthy so

707.67 --> 713.04
yeah there's something for a school

711.089 --> 717.0
shutdown at it from a pragmatic

713.04 --> 719.389
standpoint I feel that's my opinion

717.0 --> 719.389
about it

721.009 --> 728.639
yeah I paid Patricia Dockery is happy to

725.19 --> 731.0400000000001
care and teach care for and teach her

728.639 --> 733.0790000000001
own children yeah that's your home

731.04 --> 738.949
schoolers are not gonna be affected

733.079 --> 738.949
pretty much you know they're not

745.72 --> 754.0600000000001
yeah any other thoughts on this on yeah

751.15 --> 758.56
government responses to the supposed

754.06 --> 761.43
Corona situation or flu season however

758.56 --> 761.43
you want to see that

774.76 --> 780.22
I did yeah I've also been following a

777.16 --> 782.89
little Alex Jones again on this Sunday

780.22 --> 785.07
show I was listening to him in the

782.89 --> 787.9
background while I was playing games and

785.07 --> 789.49
he seemed to now be on like whoo yeah

787.9 --> 791.05
Trump it's really good that you're

789.49 --> 793.63
responding that you're taking it

791.05 --> 797.3199999999999
seriously because yeah coronavirus is

793.63 --> 800.98
everything according to the Alex Jones

797.32 --> 803.2600000000001
and and staff and all that but then he

800.98 --> 806.94
started saying but yeah don't overdo it

803.26 --> 811.15
and it'll close down the economy and

806.94 --> 816.3100000000001
yeah I wonder how much of a pony has

811.15 --> 818.9499999999999
with that if he for example United

816.31 --> 821.1999999999999
States the state borders would be closed

818.95 --> 824.0200000000001
down completely for a prolonged period

821.2 --> 826.23
what kind of effect that would have on

824.02 --> 827.89
the economy would things completely

826.23 --> 833.1
grind to a halt

827.89 --> 838.65
because of that or yeah is it not that

833.1 --> 842.1700000000001
serious I don't know I don't know how

838.65 --> 846.28
dependent the internal economy is in the

842.17 --> 848.8
United States based on direct transport

846.28 --> 851.41
capabilities across borders of the

848.8 --> 854.2199999999999
states I don't know I don't know how

851.41 --> 854.2199999999999
serious that would be

859.16 --> 867.5699999999999
germ theory is bullcrap

861.66 --> 873.12
really is it Missouri bear I don't know

867.57 --> 875.7900000000001
I think that the bacterial theory yeah

873.12 --> 878.52
it's good still be argued that indeed

875.79 --> 881.25
the body does also possess bacteria and

878.52 --> 884.1
it has it under control but there seem

881.25 --> 887.88
to definitely be hostile type of

884.1 --> 891.1800000000001
bacteria out there as well poison

887.88 --> 893.58
producing bacteria that that that are

891.18 --> 896.79
you're not gonna provide any kind of

893.58 --> 903.33
benefit to typical living beings to

896.79 --> 905.52
large organic beings and yeah if you get

903.33 --> 907.62
infected with that it still will depend

905.52 --> 910.62
very much every time on just the

907.62 --> 914.37
condition of your body your immune

910.62 --> 916.05
system if it will hit and stick and

914.37 --> 918.18
expand and all that if you get really

916.05 --> 920.31
sick it always seems to depend on that

918.18 --> 923.25
no matter what it's just your body's

920.31 --> 927.8699999999999
condition will determine how fragile you

923.25 --> 932.22
are to these types of effects the effect

927.87 --> 934.5
effect itself effectively the back even

932.22 --> 938.5500000000001
what the bacteria do that make you sick

934.5 --> 943.04
what it is always is the production of

938.55 --> 945.2099999999999
poison within the body by those bacteria

943.04 --> 949.56
substances that are just out of whack

945.21 --> 951.48
that ya don't go through any barrier in

949.56 --> 954.03
order to be filtered out but are just I

951.48 --> 957.0
don't know produced locally in in your

954.03 --> 960.2099999999999
bloodstream and that is really the

957.0 --> 966.42
toxicity that makes you then sick so in

960.21 --> 970.32
the end it's always poison really as for

966.42 --> 972.6899999999999
the viruses ie yeah that that's another

970.32 --> 974.2800000000001
issue and it's it's cool because if a

972.69 --> 979.44
known Benjamin brought it up much more

974.28 --> 982.3199999999999
detailed now yeah that viruses may

979.44 --> 985.5600000000001
indeed just be a reactionary response

982.32 --> 988.8900000000001
it's like certain type of workers that

985.56 --> 990.81
are brought out of the closet in certain

988.89 --> 993.12
specific situations and that's

990.81 --> 994.9499999999999
they arrived so they are not the cause

993.12 --> 998.94
now they are actually the more like the

994.95 --> 1002.62
cleanup crew and I thought that Benjamin

998.94 --> 1006.5600000000001
explained that very well and it's cool

1002.62 --> 1011.27
to hear just that level of information

1006.56 --> 1013.52
now going round yeah I don't know if I

1011.27 --> 1015.9399999999999
could probably pride myself in like

1013.52 --> 1020.18
being first with that [ __ ] and just

1015.94 --> 1023.12
pretty early on saying if viruses aren't

1020.18 --> 1026.24
real they're secondary it's not a

1023.12 --> 1028.88
primary cause thing and residents can

1026.24 --> 1031.67
trigger it it's not an infection thing

1028.88 --> 1033.949
necessarily all that I brought that on

1031.67 --> 1037.28
from pretty quick and then got pretty

1033.949 --> 1039.1100000000001
nervous when I did that because I knew

1037.28 --> 1043.28
that a lot of people wouldn't like that

1039.11 --> 1045.3799999999999
and I haven't heard it from anyone else

1043.28 --> 1049.54
before I said it but as soon as I did

1045.38 --> 1054.5
say it it seemed to kind of trickle

1049.54 --> 1058.04
through other people as well yes start

1054.5 --> 1059.45
it's at various starting levels you know

1058.04 --> 1061.67
because a lot of people have doubts

1059.45 --> 1064.64
about what I said about the corona virus

1061.67 --> 1067.73
like is it that what about the regular

1064.64 --> 1074.72
flu and then there is like yeah but what

1067.73 --> 1077.24
are viruses is it is it even the model

1074.72 --> 1079.64
that they say it is about getting

1077.24 --> 1082.16
infected you have to put a barrier

1079.64 --> 1084.23
between your body and the rest of the

1082.16 --> 1086.9
world in order for that thing not to

1084.23 --> 1087.71
enter you and then you get sick is that

1086.9 --> 1091.76
real

1087.71 --> 1095.95
you know and then you get into well the

1091.76 --> 1097.97
lost a lost body of knowledge concerning

1095.95 --> 1100.9
microbiology that has been kind of

1097.97 --> 1106.01
ignored in favor for the big pharma

1100.9 --> 1108.0500000000002
models of biology to keep up their sales

1106.01 --> 1114.76
pretty much that that's really where

1108.05 --> 1114.76
we're at that's what it's become okay

1115.03 --> 1122.93
yeah the old what is it the old

1119.9 --> 1128.69
principles of doctors and like only heal

1122.93 --> 1132.29
don't hurt this is long gone within the

1128.69 --> 1134.42
mechanized systems that that have come

1132.29 --> 1137.36
into being within the medical systems

1134.42 --> 1140.21
that concept is kind of gone it'll still

1137.36 --> 1143.6299999999999
be used by people that are still good

1140.21 --> 1148.1000000000001
that are kind of into that system to do

1143.63 --> 1151.3700000000001
stuff but the system itself is not about

1148.1 --> 1153.79
that anymore it's not about getting the

1151.37 --> 1159.2299999999998
right thing no it seems more about just

1153.79 --> 1161.69
medical control taking away the real

1159.23 --> 1164.21
knowledge of people so the real the

1161.69 --> 1166.31
people have to rely on the priesthood in

1164.21 --> 1168.97
this case the priesthood is just a

1166.31 --> 1171.83
function like a social function

1168.97 --> 1173.8700000000001
they then determine with each individual

1171.83 --> 1176.84
like are they are gonna get the good

1173.87 --> 1179.7199999999998
thing or are they gonna get the fake

1176.84 --> 1183.77
nonsense and yeah are gonna suffer or

1179.72 --> 1186.98
die that's the medical control system

1183.77 --> 1188.84
that comes from your handing out false

1186.98 --> 1194.39
models to everyone that you know are

1188.84 --> 1197.0
false and replacing it with a story that

1194.39 --> 1199.16
you then wide spread through media

1197.0 --> 1205.34
everywhere and that everybody learns

1199.16 --> 1209.9
about in books and newspapers medical

1205.34 --> 1213.73
control integral to the medical

1209.9 --> 1213.73
industrial complex as a whole

1229.62 --> 1233.059
all right yeah

1235.01 --> 1242.11
yeah well I've said it mark hollered

1237.62 --> 1242.11
I've said it while sporadically before

1242.35 --> 1251.0
just look at when vaccine scanning came

1245.69 --> 1253.94
into being compared it to the sanitation

1251.0 --> 1256.669
improvements and industrial improvements

1253.94 --> 1258.65
that were going on and happening in

1256.669 --> 1261.7990000000002
society back in the day during that

1258.65 --> 1264.0800000000002
period and it then just becomes more and

1261.799 --> 1267.35
more apparent that this medical

1264.08 --> 1270.049
industrial model that was introduced and

1267.35 --> 1272.299
is taking the claim for the health

1270.049 --> 1275.809
improvements due to other factors and

1272.299 --> 1279.59
that they introduced a the myth of the

1275.809 --> 1285.79
vaccine being the cure through all kinds

1279.59 --> 1285.79
of manners and it sneaked its way in

1292.95 --> 1295.55
yeah

1301.179 --> 1306.5800000000002
I'm more colored yeah well whatever I

1304.509 --> 1308.94
don't know the cost you know may be said

1306.58 --> 1311.649
it's difficult to even determine that

1308.94 --> 1315.999
but I do know that vaccines are

1311.649 --> 1319.539
definitely not helping that's become

1315.999 --> 1323.529
kind of obvious now it's like the only

1319.539 --> 1325.929
thing that seems to come out of it that

1323.529 --> 1328.21
could be considered as help or positive

1325.929 --> 1330.009
in any way from vaccines is people that

1328.21 --> 1331.979
have got them that really believed in

1330.009 --> 1335.549
them and that it did not get sick

1331.979 --> 1337.239
that's the best you can get out of that

1335.549 --> 1341.08
Wow

1337.239 --> 1343.299
isn't that just amazing wow this person

1341.08 --> 1351.1899999999998
leaves in it and nothing bad happened to

1343.299 --> 1352.809
him what a revolution incredible not so

1351.19 --> 1354.759
yeah that's the best you can get out of

1352.809 --> 1355.1689999999999
freaking vaccines instead really worth

1354.759 --> 1359.499
it

1355.169 --> 1363.419
or is it yes freakin fear porn

1359.499 --> 1363.419
indoctrination based conditioning

1372.11 --> 1377.58
just think about it think about vaccines

1375.3 --> 1381.57
what they stand for what they are

1377.58 --> 1383.76
supposed to do I compare it to people

1381.57 --> 1386.79
that literally don't care that never use

1383.76 --> 1393.03
vaccines ever and then just compare

1386.79 --> 1397.08
these two groups both get sick just that

1393.03 --> 1400.59
one doesn't really care that much get

1397.08 --> 1404.04
over the sickness relatively quickly the

1400.59 --> 1406.86
other seems to be preoccupied with

1404.04 --> 1410.31
sickness a lot probably has health

1406.86 --> 1412.2299999999998
problems probably some pharmaceuticals

1410.31 --> 1417.35
for psychological problems that come

1412.23 --> 1417.35
with it and are generally less healthy

1418.37 --> 1424.56
yeah and then again the best thing you

1421.65 --> 1425.46
can get out of vaccines is that you

1424.56 --> 1428.81
believe in it

1425.46 --> 1433.67
you take it and you don't get sick oh

1428.81 --> 1439.71
wow wow that's the best case scenario

1433.67 --> 1444.5900000000001
there is no there is nothing better even

1439.71 --> 1450.27
being promised from it okay do you see

1444.59 --> 1452.31
do you see that is it the best ever

1450.27 --> 1454.44
you could get out of vaccines is that

1452.31 --> 1457.86
you believe in it you take him and you

1454.44 --> 1462.24
don't get sick wow what a medical

1457.86 --> 1465.86
revolution is incredible really you need

1462.24 --> 1472.04
that I don't think so it's ridiculous

1465.86 --> 1475.8
and how many people take vaccines or

1472.04 --> 1478.98
have taken vaccines that never get sick

1475.8 --> 1481.53
ever that is just so insanely rare that

1478.98 --> 1485.09
that doesn't even happen people that

1481.53 --> 1485.09
take vaccines still get sick

1488.249 --> 1495.219
anyway enough about that

1491.769 --> 1497.889
ah I got some extras by the way gotta

1495.219 --> 1504.429
take and today I got some fresh

1497.889 --> 1507.279
blueberries lovely pants yeah I got a

1504.429 --> 1510.729
lot serious I thought it wasn't too

1507.279 --> 1516.129
expensive trips on the lips are great

1510.729 --> 1518.529
and fresh so delicious strawberries as

1516.129 --> 1522.4889999999998
well wow look at that look at the size

1518.529 --> 1529.45
of these monsters boy

1522.489 --> 1535.71
that's a strawberry all right it's Mel

1529.45 --> 1535.71
delicious I'm gonna take this one

1549.99 --> 1563.41
nice fresh strawberries are just special

1559.68 --> 1565.3500000000001
although this one could probably sit

1563.41 --> 1572.02
around maybe in the Sun a little longer

1565.35 --> 1573.03
they're a bit fleshy hmm that's still

1572.02 --> 1577.16
very nice

1573.03 --> 1577.16
[Music]

1639.9 --> 1643.98
okay on a plane that sounds extremely

1642.15 --> 1649.02
dark I have no idea what you're talking

1643.98 --> 1651.21
about really but I know Illuminati cause

1649.02 --> 1654.42
what I actually did have an Illuminati

1651.21 --> 1658.32
class on a Marnie oh I just finished it

1654.42 --> 1670.0800000000002
already before the show way before the

1658.32 --> 1672.36
show yeah also it was good to see that

1670.08 --> 1678.4399999999998
the grocery store was basically

1672.36 --> 1678.4399999999998
completely full again so emptied out

1678.65 --> 1687.74
before but yeah it was just completely

1682.5 --> 1687.74
filled back up as predicted

1690.38 --> 1697.1200000000001
so I think that the buying nonsense is

1694.04 --> 1697.12
kind of now stopped

1705.15 --> 1713.65
yeah kamikaze Gilmore screw that that's

1710.38 --> 1716.7700000000002
ridiculous man if something like that

1713.65 --> 1719.95
were to happen here that would be like

1716.77 --> 1720.82
in the news level there's no way that's

1719.95 --> 1723.81
gonna happen here

1720.82 --> 1723.81
no way

George Sanford says bird steal all my

1761.669 --> 1770.929
berries in the garden yeah yeah birds

1765.09 --> 1772.47
definitely do do that back in my old

1770.929 --> 1775.1100000000001
parents house

1772.47 --> 1778.77
we had a great garden too with a lot of

1775.11 --> 1781.11
berries and yes we had to every time put

1778.77 --> 1784.65
the Nets over the bushes because the

1781.11 --> 1788.3999999999999
freaking birds would just come in and

1784.65 --> 1790.679
just rip all the berries off especially

1788.4 --> 1795.9
cherries they really love the cherries

1790.679 --> 1798.39
and strawberries

1795.9 --> 1801.89
although the strawberries mostly seem to

1798.39 --> 1801.89
be attacked by snails

1812.35 --> 1815.54
[Music]

1826.679 --> 1833.6390000000001
I wouldn't know flatlander I haven't

1830.82 --> 1836.1
seen a lot of products from Mexico but

1833.639 --> 1838.1689999999999
look it's organic it's gonna be checked

1836.1 --> 1840.809
if there is something like really

1838.169 --> 1844.669
polluted that they're using there's no

1840.809 --> 1844.6689999999999
way it's gonna get through the checks

1845.269 --> 1851.999
and if it did and then later was caught

1849.179 --> 1858.72
they'd have a big problem would be a

1851.999 --> 1867.479
scandal so not a quality who do I like

1858.72 --> 1874.83
honey yeah sure honey's nice it's very

1867.479 --> 1878.159
sweet and sugary though so no there's

1874.83 --> 1881.9399999999998
times when I like get a pot of honey and

1878.159 --> 1885.3590000000002
then just start feeding off it like we

1881.94 --> 1890.3690000000001
need to poo or something but I don't do

1885.359 --> 1892.97
it too regularly my pancreas doesn't

1890.369 --> 1892.97
like that too much

1896.08 --> 1899.28

1904.33 --> 1907.85

1923.52 --> 1932.36
what honey on French fries chicken

1928.35 --> 1932.36
nuggets mm-hmm

1939.66 --> 1945.48
raw honey I don't know I've never drank

1943.32 --> 1949.52
honey directly from the hub from the

1945.48 --> 1949.52
hive Hanako Ella

1952.76 --> 1957.78
yeah sure more color I'd heard I've

1955.41 --> 1960.9
heard about like honey

1957.78 --> 1968.72
laced chicken nuggets and all that never

1960.9 --> 1968.72
tried it though don't care - its yeah

1971.22 --> 1977.4
I don't like eating honey with things

1974.43 --> 1982.5900000000001
just to be clear honey to me is a

1977.4 --> 1986.2800000000002
medicine something I take based on my

1982.59 --> 1988.6499999999999
body's impulses sometimes and that's it

1986.28 --> 1992.07
I don't like eating honey on bread I

1988.65 --> 1994.3400000000001
don't like eating honey in unity or I

1992.07 --> 1997.29
don't like eating things with honey

1994.34 --> 1999.1499999999999
because it doesn't matter what type of

1997.29 --> 2002.3
honey it is even in the if it is manuka

1999.15 --> 2004.3700000000001
because it is too much sugar i don't eat

2002.3 --> 2006.6499999999999
things with sugar anymore i just don't

2004.37 --> 2009.4399999999998
know it doesn't matter if it's cane

2006.65 --> 2017.0
sugar or if it's honey just no sugar I

2009.44 --> 2018.98
don't need that anymore so all these

2017.0 --> 2020.72
recipes about pouring honey over

2018.98 --> 2024.95
everything well that's really nice

2020.72 --> 2027.01
I don't like diabetes so that's not my

2024.95 --> 2027.01
thing

2027.04 --> 2034.229
[Music]

2035.809 --> 2044.309
yeah Manuka is incredible stuff but if

2040.71 --> 2047.6390000000001
you use it medicinally because if you're

2044.309 --> 2050.879
just gonna eat it like regular food

2047.639 --> 2059.7
staple yeah that's the honey is not good

2050.879 --> 2063.1189999999997
like that yeah oona playing manuka is

2059.7 --> 2073.5789999999997
African honey there's no 5g there it's

2063.119 --> 2073.579
nonsense besides 5g is very local

2081.71 --> 2089.73
hmm oh by the way I have to have to

2086.49 --> 2092.7
mention this I kind of weirded me out

2089.73 --> 2096.53
because I realized that some time ago

2092.7 --> 2100.3199999999997
when I first started out basically

2096.53 --> 2103.92
giving my forecast my divining as to

2100.32 --> 2106.8
what the coronavirus situation could be

2103.92 --> 2108.54
like what it seems to be or what else

2106.8 --> 2112.2200000000003
could be happening afterward and all

2108.54 --> 2116.55
that I compared it to the Spanish flu of

2112.22 --> 2118.7099999999996
1918 and then I proceeded to compare it

2116.55 --> 2121.98
to my personal experience when I was a

2118.71 --> 2125.07
little kid then I figured out how

2121.98 --> 2131.91
incredibly weird that was because the

2125.07 --> 2136.31
Spanish flu was in 1918 and I apparently

2131.91 --> 2141.2
did in my head that was kind of like I

2136.31 --> 2142.68
thought the Spanish flu was in 1980 so

2141.2 --> 2145.95
that was weird

2142.68 --> 2150.27
I tied it in with this memory that I had

2145.95 --> 2155.1299999999997
of being in that house it was 1985 I

2150.27 --> 2157.62
think 986 and like a lot of people had

2155.13 --> 2160.26
very severe flu I think somebody even

2157.62 --> 2163.91
like died in the house because of it not

2160.26 --> 2167.1000000000004
too sure so I kind of mixed that up

2163.91 --> 2170.85
it seems the Spanish flu was definitely

2167.1 --> 2177.3199999999997
not that and was actually a more extreme

2170.85 --> 2178.89
situations way back oh 102 years ago so

2177.32 --> 2182.79
that was weird

2178.89 --> 2184.56
I basically figured that out when I saw

2182.79 --> 2190.32
a quantum of consciousness latest video

2184.56 --> 2191.0
about the Spanish flu and yeah that was

2190.32 --> 2194.31
weird

2191.0 --> 2196.11
that was just weird to realize that I

2194.31 --> 2199.32
had literally mixed them up and just

2196.11 --> 2200.94
said like yeah I was there as a kid just

2199.32 --> 2203.28
like the normal thing in the world I

2200.94 --> 2209.34
remember that I remember the Spanish flu

2203.28 --> 2211.6600000000003
when I was a kid cuz you know I'm like a

2209.34 --> 2218.849
hundred and seven years old or something

2211.66 --> 2218.8489999999997
I would be that was so weird

2219.599 --> 2224.1600000000003
please spare me the gematria please

2225.78 --> 2230.71
anyway so I had to point that out that

2228.28 --> 2234.3390000000004
in my mind as I did the presentation I

2230.71 --> 2236.319
kind of did a very weird mix-up and yeah

2234.339 --> 2238.089
that was not on purpose I don't know if

2236.319 --> 2241.119
people even caught on or if they were

2238.089 --> 2243.19
even listening at all and just being

2241.119 --> 2245.28
preoccupied going back and forth about

2243.19 --> 2249.579
polarized nonsense with one another I

2245.28 --> 2252.0
don't know if you caught up on that but

2249.579 --> 2255.369
yeah that was weird to realize that I

2252.0 --> 2260.589
this basically said that I was there

2255.369 --> 2264.789
during the Spanish flu so to correct

2260.589 --> 2273.549
that no I wasn't I I don't think I was

2264.789 --> 2276.9700000000003
born yet but also yeah very informative

2273.549 --> 2279.94
to that video to look into it so if you

2276.97 --> 2282.549
haven't check out quantum of conscious

2279.94 --> 2285.88
and watch that video it's a very long

2282.549 --> 2287.89
presentation even with some like witness

2285.88 --> 2290.559
accounts very old people that remember

2287.89 --> 2294.97
it have witnessed situation people dying

2290.559 --> 2297.309
like how sudden it worked and it's

2294.97 --> 2299.6189999999997
important to know to learn from that

2297.309 --> 2307.3590000000004
it's long ago it's important to learn

2299.619 --> 2311.829
and yeah it's also interesting how it

2307.359 --> 2314.8289999999997
kind of floated up that that entire

2311.829 --> 2318.01
thing was probably by a warfare

2314.829 --> 2322.779
operation that the Spanish flu was

2318.01 --> 2326.4700000000003
literally like crossbred not not

2322.779 --> 2330.73
engineered genetically but just yeah

2326.47 --> 2334.029
letting letting Unleashed on soldiers

2330.73 --> 2335.829
and [ __ ] until it grew really bad and

2334.029 --> 2338.2
then like the worst cases they probably

2335.829 --> 2340.2400000000002
extracted blood and then try to

2338.2 --> 2342.549
weaponize it further that kind of [ __ ]

2340.24 --> 2344.0899999999997
and that is how it then eventually

2342.549 --> 2348.31
struck everyone

2344.09 --> 2348.31
and they sent it out across the world

2349.09 --> 2353.7200000000003
yeah

2350.24 --> 2357.74
culture German so even back then we're

2353.72 --> 2367.54
talking about a hundred years ago that

2357.74 --> 2367.54
kind of stuff was going on all right

2371.24 --> 2382.14
you're calling the population yes yes

2374.67 --> 2384.509
they are and I wonder sometimes what the

2382.14 --> 2387.089
world would be like not talking about

2384.509 --> 2391.829
from now on but what the world would be

2387.089 --> 2396.0589999999997
like now or even fifty years ago if all

2391.829 --> 2398.279
of that had not happened I have no idea

2396.059 --> 2403.4990000000003
what the world would be like and I have

2398.279 --> 2406.46
no idea no idea if it would have

2403.499 --> 2412.4399999999996
actually been better than it is now

2406.46 --> 2415.14
because I don't know I I don't even

2412.44 --> 2417.15
fully understand like why it's there the

2415.14 --> 2419.19
way to that level and all that yeah

2417.15 --> 2422.1600000000003
playing God that's really nice but again

2419.19 --> 2426.029
you know let me bring it up okay

2422.16 --> 2429.359
just imagine all the evil all these

2426.029 --> 2433.2
eugenics it's all gone all of it it's

2429.359 --> 2437.069
totally gone no more darkness none so

2433.2 --> 2439.71
what do you do then everybody starts to

2437.069 --> 2442.259
work according to the Lord's will

2439.71 --> 2445.44
according to logos start pumping out

2442.259 --> 2447.48
babies living good life making food

2445.44 --> 2449.91
everywhere this is gonna be some more

2447.48 --> 2454.829
mining more stuff more people getting

2449.91 --> 2456.93
bored more mining more more food more

2454.829 --> 2459.509
more people less room

2456.93 --> 2462.499
okay expand ok sacrifice more nature

2459.509 --> 2465.089
because eventually that would happen

2462.499 --> 2467.91
eventually it would probably be

2465.089 --> 2469.619
backlashes from nature or that it will

2467.91 --> 2477.23
keep on going and going on and go and go

2469.619 --> 2480.329
and then certainly then what then what

2477.23 --> 2482.97
it's just gonna keep on going forever

2480.329 --> 2484.799
until it's so full and there's nothing

2482.97 --> 2491.299
left everything's been mined everything

2484.799 --> 2494.64
is wasted and there's nowhere to go

2491.299 --> 2497.279
and I don't know if that is what it is I

2494.64 --> 2501.14
don't know that's the problem I don't

2497.279 --> 2502.95
know if they know or if this is just

2501.14 --> 2506.24
because yeah you

2502.95 --> 2511.109
always say let's just trust the designer

2506.24 --> 2514.89
let's just trust creation because it is

2511.109 --> 2519.48
created and the structures are there it

2514.89 --> 2521.31
is sensible enough but does what does

2519.48 --> 2523.829
that mean does that mean that at some

2521.31 --> 2527.04
point just the whole game is gonna

2523.829 --> 2529.349
completely change like the entire thing

2527.04 --> 2532.05
is gonna ascend like the evil falls away

2529.349 --> 2536.52
and then then everything works

2532.05 --> 2539.46
differently how how would it everything

2536.52 --> 2543.06
work differently would if the evil was

2539.46 --> 2546.57
gone there would be no more fair

2543.06 --> 2549.75
prodding giving us the feeling with like

2546.57 --> 2552.4500000000003
help we need to we need to populate we

2549.75 --> 2555.48
need to get kids and defend them against

2552.45 --> 2559.23
the evil to overcome the evil so what if

2555.48 --> 2567.329
there's no more evil will it completely

2559.23 --> 2570.48
stabilize will that happen or will the

2567.329 --> 2573.4500000000003
bar simply move and will because there

2570.48 --> 2575.4900000000002
is no more evil to hate people simply

2573.45 --> 2579.81
start to get impatient with one another

2575.49 --> 2584.49
with everyone else and the whole thing

2579.81 --> 2587.0099999999998
just bitters I don't know I don't know

2584.49 --> 2590.64
I'm thinking in models here I'm not

2587.01 --> 2593.7900000000004
thinking in Bible because in the Bible

2590.64 --> 2596.069
it seems there is really no chance it is

2593.79 --> 2597.72
more like no evil will definitely win

2596.069 --> 2603.319
and then everything switches around

2597.72 --> 2605.91
because of Christ and all that right but

2603.319 --> 2608.369
what does that mean does that make any

2605.91 --> 2610.8489999999997
sense if we're literally overcoming this

2608.369 --> 2610.849
evil

2613.16 --> 2621.3089999999997
see I did so it's also contradictory to

2619.16 --> 2621.3089999999997
me

2632.78 --> 2638.7000000000003
[Music]

2635.64 --> 2639.48
okay oh that's an interesting concept a

2638.7 --> 2642.54
man like me

2639.48 --> 2645.75
look I'm basically being kind of bit of

2642.54 --> 2648.3
a philosopher you could say bit of a

2645.75 --> 2650.4
nihilist maybe it's just models

2648.3 --> 2651.8300000000004
continuing on think I'm just trying to

2650.4 --> 2655.53
figure it out

2651.83 --> 2658.92
to understand but yeah it could

2655.53 --> 2663.17
definitely be that at some point at some

2658.92 --> 2667.41
level some number of humans in the world

2663.17 --> 2673.11
that after certain points there will be

2667.41 --> 2676.14
no more life born people like they

2673.11 --> 2677.88
simply will not spawn living maybe

2676.14 --> 2681.18
that's what will happen maybe at some

2677.88 --> 2683.31
point it's just so many people they

2681.18 --> 2686.3999999999996
won't be born anymore until other words

2683.31 --> 2693.12
die maybe it'll work like that I have no

2686.4 --> 2695.58
freaking idea man but yeah if it would

2693.12 --> 2697.89
just continue indefinitely and there

2695.58 --> 2700.29
would be no limit while there is

2697.89 --> 2704.1
definitely a limit to the amount of

2700.29 --> 2706.4
space within the physical realm then

2704.1 --> 2706.4
what

2718.44 --> 2722.64
that's that's also very nice how to

2721.41 --> 2725.45
koala yeah sure

2722.64 --> 2727.95
yeah trusting God trust in afterlife

2725.45 --> 2730.56
that's that's great and there's

2727.95 --> 2733.68
something to that but I don't know I'm

2730.56 --> 2738.0299999999997
still in this world and I'm just

2733.68 --> 2739.8599999999997
thinking like what so we I don't know

2738.03 --> 2743.3700000000003
thinking about yeah

2739.86 --> 2747.06
but heaven if I just do things right

2743.37 --> 2751.98
according to the principles and then

2747.06 --> 2754.19
things will be all right I may be saying

2751.98 --> 2758.22
something that might strike people

2754.19 --> 2763.7400000000002
peoples nerve in a bad way but doesn't

2758.22 --> 2768.2999999999997
that seem kind of selfish really it's

2763.74 --> 2770.58
like no I'm doing it right people around

2768.3 --> 2772.59
me will be positively influenced and

2770.58 --> 2775.86
I'll do it right I'll follow the

2772.59 --> 2779.31
principles and and then I'll have a yeah

2775.86 --> 2782.25
and create afterlife but what about the

2779.31 --> 2784.71
rest of the freaking world like where is

2782.25 --> 2787.74
that going so even though you've got

2784.71 --> 2791.01
your place what about the rest of the

2787.74 --> 2794.0699999999997
way I don't know I don't know man maybe

2791.01 --> 2797.219
I'm just being taking it way too far

2794.07 --> 2797.219
[Music]

2813.7 --> 2818.37
what I sound like a Star Trek episode

2818.79 --> 2822.27
and what

2837.369 --> 2845.829
right well there you go Missouri Bear

2840.21 --> 2847.599
doesn't isn't that literally just and on

2845.829 --> 2849.549
one of the things that I basically

2847.599 --> 2852.7290000000003
presented it's like it's none of my

2849.549 --> 2856.2889999999998
concern it's just my world I don't know

2852.729 --> 2856.2889999999998
it just seems selfish to me

2857.099 --> 2864.309
although yeah it is a pragmatic teaching

2861.849 --> 2866.0190000000002
a very wise lesson that if you want to

2864.309 --> 2873.46
help others you gotta help yourself

2866.019 --> 2876.2189999999996
first by that sense it makes sense but

2873.46 --> 2878.65
maybe it is kind of like wanting to help

2876.219 --> 2882.5190000000002
a world is even a bit almost arrogant

2878.65 --> 2886.39
maybe it is slightly Luciferian you know

2882.519 --> 2891.069
in I guess a positive way or spawning

2886.39 --> 2893.89
from positive will that eventually as

2891.069 --> 2896.43
you grow older and you you do figure out

2893.89 --> 2900.999
that it really only was about that

2896.43 --> 2904.269
because the idea that you can change the

2900.999 --> 2907.4199999999996
world just over time will erode to you

2904.269 --> 2909.9399999999996
and you'll figure out that it just

2907.42 --> 2912.099
looked like you could influence the

2909.94 --> 2915.279
world and you didn't really because

2912.099 --> 2915.759
everything made up its own mind I don't

2915.279 --> 2920.619
know man

2915.759 --> 2922.809
I guess I just worry about some of this

2920.619 --> 2925.349
existential nonsense a little bit too

2922.809 --> 2925.349
much sometimes

2930.2 --> 2933.239
[Music]

2947.41 --> 2951.0699999999997
right good service

2953.609 --> 2958.42
well for me it's slightly different you

2956.68 --> 2963.91
know respecting everyone's free will

2958.42 --> 2966.7000000000003
it's rather I rather see it as there's

2963.91 --> 2970.54
just nothing you can do about it because

2966.7 --> 2972.8489999999997
to be fair I don't respect people's free

2970.54 --> 2979.049
will a lot because a lot of people make

2972.849 --> 2982.78
really freakin stupid useless and

2979.049 --> 2984.22
wasteful choices including myself at

2982.78 --> 2985.9
times and now of course you make

2984.22 --> 2988.2099999999996
mistakes to learn from them but then

2985.9 --> 2991.089
there's a lot of people that don't learn

2988.21 --> 2994.42
from them and then I don't have to

2991.089 --> 3001.17
respect that in my personal view you

2994.42 --> 3003.059
know but as a realization yeah they have

3001.17 --> 3006.9
free will whether you like it or not

3003.059 --> 3010.2900000000004
they're not gonna cooperate with reason

3006.9 --> 3014.13
just because it is reason people just

3010.29 --> 3016.89
don't they don't they do the opposite on

3014.13 --> 3019.38
a number of occasions it's like every

3016.89 --> 3024.24
chance they get they will spike energy

3019.38 --> 3031.8900000000003
just to do exactly the opposite and see

3024.24 --> 3035.3689999999997
that a lot but again yeah

3031.89 --> 3043.17
I worry too much but other people should

3035.369 --> 3045.059
worry more about myself so maybe it is

3043.17 --> 3048.39
kind of projection it's awkward

3045.059 --> 3051.599
projection probably from my I feel the

3048.39 --> 3054.92
few the fuel to the impulse like I want

3051.599 --> 3060.059
to change how things work out there and

3054.92 --> 3062.549
alter choices that people make but yeah

3060.059 --> 3067.01
that's probably coming forth from a

3062.549 --> 3069.66
long-term frustration about how little

3067.01 --> 3075.059
influence I seem to have over my own

3069.66 --> 3078.42
life or it seemed because pretty sure I

3075.059 --> 3083.2200000000003
do have influence it just seems not to

3078.42 --> 3085.08
be manifesting as much as I wanted to on

3083.22 --> 3089.8199999999997
the other hand with it

3085.08 --> 3094.68
rather that as much as I wanted to write

3089.82 --> 3097.53
you think well often when I want

3094.68 --> 3099.87
something to manifest and then I really

3097.53 --> 3103.86
go for it and it turns out that it's not

3099.87 --> 3105.96
becoming what I originally wanted to and

3103.86 --> 3109.2000000000003
that especially counts for social

3105.96 --> 3114.56
interactions because a lot of people

3109.2 --> 3118.1099999999997
just disappoint me in very personal

3114.56 --> 3119.85
interactions a lot and then again I just

3118.11 --> 3122.4500000000003
look at myself like yeah they're

3119.85 --> 3125.8199999999997
disappointing me or is it me actually

3122.45 --> 3129.8599999999997
disappointing relatively normal human

3125.82 --> 3129.86
beings out there you know

3145.53 --> 3151.11
all right but by the way I think that I

3148.14 --> 3155.22
happen to sniffles as well I think I

3151.11 --> 3161.76
have a very minor cold and it's not

3155.22 --> 3164.7
constant even it's very mild very very

3161.76 --> 3169.0400000000004
mild it's I don't have any kind of lung

3164.7 --> 3169.04
issues so it's at all

3176.2 --> 3183.24
Thank You Hana koala I appreciate it

3179.17 --> 3191.92
it's in a way it's kind of scary for me

3183.24 --> 3194.4399999999996
to share this because this is going to

3191.92 --> 3197.6800000000003
be a bit complex but a lot of these

3194.44 --> 3201.88
questions that I'm asking now and that

3197.68 --> 3209.5299999999997
I'm pondering them that is kind of what

3201.88 --> 3212.589
certain individuals asked me to

3209.53 --> 3216.67
basically try to convert me to their

3212.589 --> 3219.2799999999997
views and the problem was this is the

3216.67 --> 3224.799
real problem is that their questions

3219.28 --> 3225.52
which is really good and that's the

3224.799 --> 3228.549
problem

3225.52 --> 3231.309
but then again yeah at the same time

3228.549 --> 3234.13
they were absolutely in denial of

3231.309 --> 3235.75
anything God related or planned purpose

3234.13 --> 3240.7000000000003
that kind of is they were completely

3235.75 --> 3243.66
reversed world thinking so it seemed it

3240.7 --> 3248.7
was kind of great it's more like they

3243.66 --> 3252.339
they extracted really good questions

3248.7 --> 3254.29
that had nothing to do even with their

3252.339 --> 3257.799
entire worldview they were basically

3254.29 --> 3260.74
lending a good powerful piece of

3257.799 --> 3262.359
thinking from an from somebody else out

3260.74 --> 3265.75
there that was not like that I'm sure

3262.359 --> 3270.64
they were to use it as kind of a

3265.75 --> 3274.059
spiritual deflection weapon or rod to

3270.64 --> 3278.7599999999998
try to poke somebody to go along with

3274.059 --> 3284.0690000000004
you because in the end none of them ever

3278.76 --> 3288.7000000000003
followed through on any philosophy

3284.069 --> 3291.3089999999997
except for the worst ones like it was

3288.7 --> 3293.95
all just excuses because none of them

3291.309 --> 3298.75
had any real principles other than just

3293.95 --> 3300.8489999999997
pure ego feeding and keeping up the

3298.75 --> 3304.049
discipline in order not to get caught

3300.849 --> 3304.049
that kind of [ __ ]

3304.88 --> 3314.9100000000003
disgusting anyway what I got it

3311.48 --> 3317.119
they it is kind of the thing that they

3314.91 --> 3321.21
tried to lure me in with with just

3317.119 --> 3324.44
really intelligent thinking way beyond

3321.21 --> 3327.42
what bass people are occupied with and

3324.44 --> 3329.91
this is in a time when there was there

3327.42 --> 3333.08
was no internet yet so you can imagine

3329.91 --> 3336.75
imagine they would seemed like a very

3333.08 --> 3340.02
rich source of information like a new

3336.75 --> 3346.92
ground that to me at the time only

3340.02 --> 3349.17
seemed available there and well am I

3346.92 --> 3351.48
glad to see that over the ages and the

3349.17 --> 3355.17
internet arriving that that's not at the

3351.48 --> 3357.15
case at all and it's all been revealed

3355.17 --> 3360.6800000000003
rather to be a trick they tried to use

3357.15 --> 3363.9
to fool me and the world is full of

3360.68 --> 3369.66
people that have great information and

3363.9 --> 3373.26
that can simply conjure up ideas and and

3369.66 --> 3375.1189999999997
are open and are yeah are open to

3373.26 --> 3377.88
actually share them with the rest of the

3375.119 --> 3381.51
world to reflect upon those and that is

3377.88 --> 3384.33
something I had not seen coming earlier

3381.51 --> 3386.5200000000004
again in the time when the internet came

3384.33 --> 3389.7
there were these philosophers and he big

3386.52 --> 3392.339
tech people saying this singularity is

3389.7 --> 3395.16
coming the city of the AI will become so

3392.339 --> 3398.31
smart that suddenly time will break and

3395.16 --> 3400.17
we will fuse with the singular blah blah

3398.31 --> 3405.119
blah da da da remember all that sci-fi

3400.17 --> 3407.04
fantasy nonsense right well it seems

3405.119 --> 3410.609
like there is a singularity but the

3407.04 --> 3412.41
singularity is not digital although it

3410.609 --> 3416.0989999999997
is in the digital world

3412.41 --> 3419.79
no the singularity is every one of our

3416.099 --> 3423.9900000000002
conscious that is kind of found a new

3419.79 --> 3427.8
ground that is pretty free pretty

3423.99 --> 3429.81
unabated where suddenly everybody starts

3427.8 --> 3431.4900000000002
blooming and ascending in consciousness

3429.81 --> 3434.58
getting further than they would have

3431.49 --> 3435.279
ever gotten just without the internet

3434.58 --> 3437.89
entire

3435.279 --> 3441.009
and I think that is the real singularity

3437.89 --> 3444.969
and I never saw that coming that their

3441.009 --> 3449.969
straw man puppet idea of the singularity

3444.969 --> 3454.599
of the a I successfully fooled me into

3449.969 --> 3457.409
believing into overlooking that this was

3454.599 --> 3460.3900000000003
coming I did not see this coming

3457.409 --> 3463.599
yet it is here and I recognize that it's

3460.39 --> 3467.799
here it is the Ascension it is the

3463.599 --> 3472.179
spiritual psychological conscious

3467.799 --> 3474.579
awakening and everybody is feeding of it

3472.179 --> 3477.669
everybody is in need of this everybody's

3474.579 --> 3481.739
trying to find more pure sources more

3477.669 --> 3484.779
pure ideas and continue with that and

3481.739 --> 3486.819
figure more things out and get better

3484.779 --> 3488.709
more refined long-term thinking

3486.819 --> 3490.65
responses and it's getting better and

3488.709 --> 3494.2889999999998
better everybody's improving with this

3490.65 --> 3500.0190000000002
it's very exhilarating and I never saw

3494.289 --> 3502.029
it coming not really even though in dark

3500.019 --> 3505.8689999999997
world experiences I did go through it

3502.029 --> 3508.719
but to me as I went through some of this

3505.869 --> 3511.839
some of this the things the early bird

3508.719 --> 3513.64
showed the Flat Earth debates my ideas

3511.839 --> 3515.38
concerning the looping realm and the

3513.64 --> 3522.7889999999998
holographic nature of the heavens and

3515.38 --> 3528.369
all that I I saw it but in the

3522.789 --> 3531.6400000000003
experience I I'm that just I don't think

3528.369 --> 3536.65
it was really me because when I heard it

3531.64 --> 3538.209
it it just yeah it's it's hard to

3536.65 --> 3542.619
explain that experience that I

3538.209 --> 3545.709
experienced some of this way back but

3542.619 --> 3548.529
because of how I experienced it I could

3545.709 --> 3552.4289999999996
not remember it would not come to me

3548.529 --> 3558.009
back then so I never saw it coming even

3552.429 --> 3561.759
though I've literally seen it you've not

3558.009 --> 3566.349
literally seen it I could not see it

3561.759 --> 3568.23
going how crazy is that literally seeing

3566.349 --> 3572.1600000000003
it through dark world

3568.23 --> 3574.38
situations yep as I came out of it I

3572.16 --> 3575.69
could not see this coming but it's here

3574.38 --> 3578.4
now

3575.69 --> 3580.92
so yeah and with that I'm gonna round

3578.4 --> 3583.5
