75.28 --> 80.0
please also do support me through the

77.6 --> 82.24

and membership system join button

82.24 --> 89.119
that will be much appreciated

85.6 --> 93.91999999999999
so whether today is different

89.119 --> 97.28
again it's very moist today

93.92 --> 98.799
kind of hazy and clouded a couple of

97.28 --> 102.32000000000001
blue spots but

98.799 --> 102.32000000000001
overall it's just this

102.399 --> 108.24
kind of thin cloud

105.92 --> 109.759
or rather it's kind of it is kind of

108.24 --> 113.91999999999999
thick but it is

109.759 --> 115.119
not it is still kind of transparent so

113.92 --> 118.32000000000001
there's still

115.119 --> 118.64
light coming through the clouds and it

118.32 --> 121.52
is

118.64 --> 123.2
warm and it is very moist especially i

121.52 --> 124.719
don't know if the camera picks this up

123.2 --> 128.31900000000002
but

124.719 --> 130.56
to the distance this little bit of a

128.319 --> 132.879
white haze

130.56 --> 135.84
gets in between and that's how i know

132.879 --> 135.84
it's very moist

136.56 --> 145.84
you see less far very clearly

143.52 --> 145.84
all right

152.64 --> 160.879
it's friday the 11th

157.44 --> 164.959
of june 2021

160.879 --> 169.35999999999999
and i'm on time on time for my own show

164.959 --> 172.8
how about that hey nathan oakley

169.36 --> 172.8
1980 good to see you

173.599 --> 179.76
great show yesterday although

176.959 --> 181.519
you rounded out the after show exactly

179.76 --> 184.239
the moment i came back

181.519 --> 184.959
that was a bit disappointing i heard

184.239 --> 186.879
overheard

184.959 --> 189.28
from the guys that you were mentioning

186.879 --> 199.28
me and i wasn't there

189.28 --> 213.84
i'm sorry

199.28 --> 213.84
all right

224.84 --> 227.84
uh

229.12 --> 235.92000000000002
right anyway i did go to bed pretty late

232.48 --> 236.879
but not super late it's hard to tell

235.92 --> 239.51899999999998
anyway

236.879 --> 241.84
i managed to get up in time i just said

239.519 --> 244.72
it like that

241.84 --> 246.56
so that's some time to wake up do my

244.72 --> 250.159
wake-up routine

246.56 --> 250.159
and get on time for a change

250.87 --> 254.159
[Music]

252.84 --> 258.32
uh

254.159 --> 261.03999999999996
yesterday night been watching more

258.32 --> 261.04
sweet tooth

262.8 --> 265.949
[Music]

266.56 --> 271.12
i was also hoping for a new owen

268.639 --> 273.84000000000003
benjamin

271.12 --> 273.84000000000003
what's that one

276.56 --> 278.88
huh

280.88 --> 286.08
all right now he just seemed to have

284.16 --> 291.36
uploaded one somewhere this night

286.08 --> 297.84
so i haven't watched it back yet anyway

291.36 --> 297.84000000000003
in bit of infowars

302.479 --> 304.71999999999997
um

309.6 --> 313.84000000000003
oh yeah i was hanging around over at

311.6 --> 315.68
brandon's in chat

313.84 --> 317.67999999999995
but having a back and forth with this

315.68 --> 319.84000000000003
guy i don't know who that was but he

317.68 --> 322.24
sounded very young

319.84 --> 323.44
just kept on asking the same question

322.24 --> 325.84000000000003
over and over again

323.44 --> 325.84
because

326.639 --> 330.479
he was very much onto newtonian

328.88 --> 331.84
mechanics apparently he was in the

330.479 --> 337.039
middle of his fanhood

331.84 --> 339.35999999999996
of that hey hello that flat fellow

337.039 --> 342.32
welcome to chat thanks for the 99 cent

339.36 --> 345.759
super chat donation

342.32 --> 349.44
uh he kept asking

345.759 --> 352.0
like why can gasses move in lockstep

349.44 --> 354.24
with the rotation of the earth

352.0 --> 357.6
so i try to explain him in pretty much

354.24 --> 361.199
every conceivable way

357.6 --> 363.91900000000004
gases are not susceptible to my momentum

361.199 --> 363.91900000000004
right they don't

364.84 --> 371.75899999999996
continue the gas doesn't continue its

368.72 --> 375.6
motion after it's been set

371.759 --> 378.96000000000004
on a moving trajectory

375.6 --> 382.56
like liquids and solids do

378.96 --> 385.039
why right because gases only respond to

382.56 --> 387.919
gas pressure differential

385.039 --> 390.31899999999996
so even if you have a contained bit of

387.919 --> 393.52
gas like in a balloon or in some

390.319 --> 395.199
more solid container then the gases

393.52 --> 398.96
inside

395.199 --> 401.28000000000003
are not going to be perfectly uniform

398.96 --> 403.19899999999996
as the thing moves just like even in a

401.28 --> 404.23999999999995
car like a car with closed windows

403.199 --> 407.12
accelerating

404.24 --> 409.44
the gases inside are not going to remain

407.12 --> 413.039
perfectly

409.44 --> 414.96
even they go they go into this

413.039 --> 418.24
equilibrium why

414.96 --> 421.44
because the container walls are moving

418.24 --> 422.96000000000004
within euclidean space and that causes a

421.44 --> 425.199
push

422.96 --> 427.28
the air that wants to stay still because

425.199 --> 428.479
it's not susceptible my momentum doesn't

427.28 --> 436.0
gain that

428.479 --> 438.08
so it starts to push back

436.0 --> 440.08
right gases are not susceptible my

438.08 --> 443.919
momentum if you move it it's always

440.08 --> 443.919
going to rearrange its pressure

445.039 --> 448.24
because it wants to stay in place it

446.96 --> 450.0
would and i

448.24 --> 453.36
spent like half an hour trying to

450.0 --> 455.52
explaining that guy in chat

453.36 --> 457.039
over and over again but then he just

455.52 --> 460.15999999999997
ended up saying what do you

457.039 --> 462.56
deny newtonian law

460.16 --> 464.0
i even tried to explain okay well that's

462.56 --> 466.08
within his model

464.0 --> 467.44
that really kind of excludes gas

466.08 --> 470.31899999999996
behavior except for

467.44 --> 479.84
air friction like the gas behaviors

470.319 --> 479.84000000000003
direct effect on objects

480.16 --> 485.68
so but i think that the guy was really

483.52 --> 488.96
trying to

485.68 --> 490.639
get it but he was kind of still in the

488.96 --> 492.15999999999997
middle of newtonian mechanics and that's

490.639 --> 494.08
what makes me think

492.16 --> 497.12
makes me think he was probably in a

494.08 --> 497.12
certain age range

497.44 --> 501.28
because when you get taught that in

498.96 --> 503.599
school when i got it taught in school

501.28 --> 504.71999999999997
was a big fan of it would be totally

503.599 --> 507.84
into it

504.72 --> 509.03900000000004
referencing like comparing everything to

507.84 --> 510.87899999999996
it

509.039 --> 513.039
right so then when you get to here oh

510.879 --> 515.599
it's not actually correct

513.039 --> 517.519
can be a hard thing to get through when

515.599 --> 518.719
you're really kind of in love with

517.519 --> 521.839
playing

518.719 --> 524.0
with the system the newtonian mechanic

521.839 --> 527.6
system

524.0 --> 530.72
so right

527.6 --> 530.72
it's always worth a shot

531.519 --> 535.36
when somebody's in that position to try

533.36 --> 538.48
and get through to them to hand them an

535.36 --> 541.76
even better system that's more reliable

538.48 --> 545.519
and that's what i try to do right

541.76 --> 548.399
even some random person in chat

545.519 --> 550.399
you know in between the trolls or maybe

548.399 --> 551.76
it is a troll and they're kind of like

550.399 --> 562.72
in the middle of

551.76 --> 568.08
trying to move on by actually learning

562.72 --> 569.519
why is that if not momentum

568.08 --> 571.44
it's because of gas pressure

569.519 --> 576.64
differential

571.44 --> 579.2
that's why can't you get it the air

576.64 --> 579.76
surrounding the balloon rearranges

579.2 --> 582.72
itself

579.76 --> 583.279
because it is trying to stay in its

582.72 --> 586.64
exact

583.279 --> 588.959
euclidean location

586.64 --> 591.1999999999999
but because the car is accelerating

588.959 --> 595.8389999999999
forward

591.2 --> 599.6800000000001
the gas is basically

595.839 --> 601.7600000000001
trying to stay in position pushing back

599.68 --> 603.04
effectively on the back of the car on

601.76 --> 605.8389999999999
the inside

603.04 --> 607.92
causing a pressure differential buildup

605.839 --> 610.8000000000001
pressure starts to

607.92 --> 613.4399999999999
build up at the back causing the helium

610.8 --> 614.88
balloon which is lower density to move

613.44 --> 618.8000000000001
to the lower pressure

614.88 --> 621.68
zone within the container

618.8 --> 622.4799999999999
right it's not because of momentum it's

621.68 --> 624.2399999999999
because the

622.48 --> 626.8000000000001
gas pressure differential within the

624.24 --> 626.8
container

629.76 --> 633.36
if the thing with momentum in general is

632.32 --> 637.6
is that things that

633.36 --> 640.8000000000001
are suspended within the momentum

637.6 --> 643.6
they are effectively still

640.8 --> 645.1999999999999
to it right but doesn't abide by gases

643.6 --> 648.9590000000001
but anything solid liquid

645.2 --> 649.9200000000001
it's just going to move and it's going

648.959 --> 653.279
to be

649.92 --> 658.7199999999999
within its con confinement pretty much

653.279 --> 658.72
at equilibrium like a body of water

658.839 --> 661.839
trapped

661.92 --> 668.7199999999999
like it's going to retain momentum

666.0 --> 670.8
so it's not going to be really pushing

668.72 --> 674.88
on the back

670.8 --> 676.64
inside it although yeah with what like a

674.88 --> 678.72
water balloon it's pretty difficult but

676.64 --> 682.16
mostly as soon as it really

678.72 --> 684.5600000000001
attains the stable speed then the forces

682.16 --> 687.519
that are going around within it

684.56 --> 690.7199999999999
to make the liquid find an equilibrium

687.519 --> 690.72
because it does that too

692.16 --> 697.12
yeah as soon as it finds a stable speed

694.72 --> 701.44
it will be in a momentum situation

697.12 --> 703.2
and the forces turbulent forces that the

701.44 --> 703.839
water in the balloon is being subjected

703.2 --> 706.9590000000001
to will

703.839 --> 709.6800000000001
stabilize right it's only

706.959 --> 711.279
when the balloon is in the acceleration

709.68 --> 713.12
phase of the motion

711.279 --> 715.04
that it might wobble a little because

713.12 --> 717.6
it's being subjected to the forces

715.04 --> 720.16
as is accelerating but as soon as it

717.6 --> 723.839
reaches a stable speed well it's rubber

720.16 --> 725.519
solid and it's or half solid it's

723.839 --> 727.7600000000001
complicated just like glass

725.519 --> 730.5600000000001
and water a liquid well they both retain

727.76 --> 733.76
momentum so it will stabilize

730.56 --> 735.3599999999999
if you do that with gas in it the gas is

733.76 --> 738.3199999999999
not going to be

735.36 --> 739.519
stabilized because it does not retain

738.32 --> 741.44
momentum it just

739.519 --> 743.44
responds to air pressure differential

741.44 --> 759.839
and tries to stay

743.44 --> 759.839
in its location

766.079 --> 769.4399999999999
right well pam cow you could even well

768.32 --> 773.839
test it in a car

769.44 --> 773.839
by taking an aquarium filled with water

773.92 --> 777.36
and i would close the top by the way

775.839 --> 778.9590000000001
because you don't want to have water

777.36 --> 781.04
spill out in your car

778.959 --> 782.8
and a helium balloon next to that and

781.04 --> 785.519
then accelerate

782.8 --> 788.8
right the water is going to move back

785.519 --> 790.72
because it is in the acceleratory phase

788.8 --> 792.56
the balloon will be pressed forward

790.72 --> 794.8000000000001
because the gas in the car

792.56 --> 796.8
is being pushed backward but as soon as

794.8 --> 800.88
the car reaches

796.8 --> 803.5999999999999
stable speed the water will kind of

800.88 --> 803.6
stabilize

804.88 --> 810.959
and up to a certain degree so may the

808.48 --> 814.24
helium balloon

810.959 --> 816.8
because well not

814.24 --> 817.6
fully it shouldn't be fully doing that

816.8 --> 822.56
because

817.6 --> 825.36
as long as you're moving you know

822.56 --> 827.04
the gas will still find some need to

825.36 --> 829.76
stay euclidean

827.04 --> 830.48
and then keem keep being pushed forward

829.76 --> 833.76
by

830.48 --> 843.839
the back part of the car

833.76 --> 843.8389999999999
of the inside containment of it

847.839 --> 851.36
it's not being subjected by momentum it

849.839 --> 853.7600000000001
only responds to air pressure

851.36 --> 857.6800000000001
differential and if it is contained

853.76 --> 861.199
and if the entire container moves

857.68 --> 861.199
then the gas within is still

861.519 --> 866.5600000000001
just going to respond to air pressure to

863.92 --> 871.8389999999999
gas pressure differentials

866.56 --> 871.8389999999999
within the contained system

874.16 --> 885.8389999999999
the water is subjected to momentum

877.6 --> 885.839
but the water vapor isn't

888.32 --> 896.0790000000001
right that's correct it's a but

891.839 --> 899.44
again it's going to be within a

896.079 --> 901.199
closed window system of the car

899.44 --> 902.8800000000001
so it's still just going to respond to

901.199 --> 905.3599999999999
the pressure situation

902.88 --> 907.92
as it is already there as gas is trying

905.36 --> 913.12
to find an equilibrium within the

907.92 --> 915.36
moving system

913.12 --> 915.36
right

920.0 --> 924.56
i don't know how to put electrically how

922.48 --> 926.24
about that

924.56 --> 927.76
that should be able to work don't

926.24 --> 931.199
recommend using a

927.76 --> 931.199
water boiler in a car

931.44 --> 937.519
but maybe if you have like a caravan

934.0 --> 937.519
that would be a little bit safer

938.32 --> 941.839
that could work

952.29 --> 955.809
[Music]

975.92 --> 982.4799999999999
very good it's not a close well it is

979.04 --> 985.759
if the windows are closed

982.48 --> 988.9590000000001
it's not perfectly closed right it's not

985.759 --> 992.16
seamless not airtight but it is

988.959 --> 994.399
pretty close closed enough that there

992.16 --> 998.16
won't be any strong

994.399 --> 998.16
wind stream going through it

998.639 --> 1011.839
yeah right so it's closed enough

1012.959 --> 1025.839
right look at that bum cow

1029.6 --> 1033.36
okay well that's really nice then george

1032.24 --> 1035.36
sanford

1033.36 --> 1037.6
thanks for all the nitpicking but i

1035.36 --> 1039.839
don't see how that actually changes my

1037.6 --> 1039.839
point

1058.64 --> 1062.72
look it's closed enough in the sense

1062.08 --> 1066.24
that

1062.72 --> 1068.64
it's close enough to withstand

1066.24 --> 1070.64
the air on the outside that does not

1068.64 --> 1072.48
want to really go with the motion of the

1070.64 --> 1076.0
car

1072.48 --> 1076.559
to not carry the gas on the inside of

1076.0 --> 1080.0
the car

1076.559 --> 1082.3999999999999
with it in a turbulent

1080.0 --> 1083.12
grip like if when you open the windows

1082.4 --> 1086.16
of all the

1083.12 --> 1087.12
all the windows of the car the gas from

1086.16 --> 1089.8400000000001
the outside

1087.12 --> 1092.0
which will stay try to stay in its

1089.84 --> 1094.08
position and only respond to local air

1092.0 --> 1097.84
pressure differential

1094.08 --> 1101.12
it will get in there in the car

1097.84 --> 1102.72
and then out of the car carrying

1101.12 --> 1105.6
whatever is in it with it

1102.72 --> 1106.799
most of it except the gas that kind of

1105.6 --> 1123.84
stays in the corner

1106.799 --> 1123.84
but yeah turbulence you know

1133.6 --> 1137.12
anyway yeah that came up thought it

1135.76 --> 1139.28
would be worthy

1137.12 --> 1141.9189999999999
thing to address on the show a little

1139.28 --> 1145.6789999999999
bit of mechanics

1141.919 --> 1145.679
hope you appreciate me bring that up

1148.24 --> 1151.6
right and it is basically stemming forth

1151.039 --> 1155.12
from

1151.6 --> 1157.6
well the argument that gases on the

1155.12 --> 1161.1999999999998
presupposed spinning ball earth

1157.6 --> 1165.039
could not move in lockstep with

1161.2 --> 1168.0
the the spinning ball earth because gas

1165.039 --> 1171.039
doesn't want to it wants to stay in its

1168.0 --> 1173.6
euclidean position

1171.039 --> 1175.6
and this is expressed in the science

1173.6 --> 1177.36
fiction creation that's been reified

1175.6 --> 1179.1999999999998
into reality as being taught in school

1177.36 --> 1183.52
books

1179.2 --> 1187.1200000000001
into the terrestrial coriolis effect

1183.52 --> 1189.76
where it is suggested that there is

1187.12 --> 1192.9599999999998
coriolis d that basically the gas isn't

1189.76 --> 1194.8799999999999
moving in lockstep which it shouldn't

1192.96 --> 1196.24
and that there's all kinds of deviations

1194.88 --> 1199.3600000000001
going on

1196.24 --> 1201.679
but then of course when you try to

1199.36 --> 1204.3999999999999
draw the natural consequences of this

1201.679 --> 1207.919
deviation you'll find that on earth

1204.4 --> 1212.0800000000002
there are no such deviations

1207.919 --> 1212.0800000000002
there is no constant deviation happening

1212.799 --> 1216.6399999999999
right and that's why that baller

1214.64 --> 1217.2800000000002
trenchers came up with the air moves in

1216.64 --> 1221.8400000000001
lockstep

1217.28 --> 1221.84
but yeah that's physically impossible

1222.72 --> 1227.2
because air is not susceptible by

1224.799 --> 1235.84
momentum it only responds to local air

1227.2 --> 1235.8400000000001
pressure differential

1260.84 --> 1265.12
um

1263.36 --> 1266.6399999999999
right yes seeking star wars and it's

1265.12 --> 1270.559
funny isn't it because

1266.64 --> 1272.88
when gas moves it's always in

1270.559 --> 1274.84
in form of turbulence there's always

1272.88 --> 1276.0800000000002
turbulence going to happen when gas

1274.84 --> 1279.52
moves

1276.08 --> 1282.72
it just happens or even with water

1279.52 --> 1286.48
it doesn't but when you

1282.72 --> 1290.24
throw water through air

1286.48 --> 1293.1200000000001
right then even the turbulent

1290.24 --> 1294.159
effects of the gases that it's going

1293.12 --> 1297.12
through

1294.159 --> 1299.3600000000001
are kind of gonna rub off on the water

1297.12 --> 1301.9189999999999
making it kind of

1299.36 --> 1303.4399999999998
start to behave in this reversed

1301.919 --> 1306.5590000000002
turbulence

1303.44 --> 1309.76
way it's gonna like wobble out and show

1306.559 --> 1312.08
like spirally patterns because

1309.76 --> 1313.6
it is being subjected to the turbulence

1312.08 --> 1315.039
of the air

1313.6 --> 1317.36
and i'm talking like when you throw a

1315.039 --> 1320.8799999999999
bucket of water loosely like

1317.36 --> 1321.9189999999999
it splits up it yeah it does things it

1320.88 --> 1324.96
doesn't just stay

1321.919 --> 1327.2800000000002
a uniform blob of water right

1324.96 --> 1328.799
because it's going through the air and

1327.28 --> 1330.8799999999999
the air

1328.799 --> 1332.559
yeah if you subject air to movement it's

1330.88 --> 1333.8400000000001
going to be turbulence effects well if

1332.559 --> 1336.8799999999999
something else

1333.84 --> 1339.76
like liquid that is

1336.88 --> 1340.24
still fluid is going to go through that

1339.76 --> 1342.96
gas

1340.24 --> 1344.32
then the the gas trying to stay in its

1342.96 --> 1345.919
position

1344.32 --> 1348.08
staying euclidean is going to press

1345.919 --> 1350.3200000000002
against it and then the

1348.08 --> 1351.1999999999998
liquid is going to be subjected by like

1350.32 --> 1354.48
reversed

1351.2 --> 1357.28
turbulence effect i always thought that

1354.48 --> 1360.88
was interesting too

1357.28 --> 1364.32
right but as long as the

1360.88 --> 1367.3600000000001
water would be stuck in a balloon

1364.32 --> 1369.2
then those turbulent effects reverse

1367.36 --> 1372.24
turbulent effect would not

1369.2 --> 1375.76
happen because the balloon is

1372.24 --> 1376.64
keeping it all into place preventing the

1375.76 --> 1379.52
air from

1376.64 --> 1380.5590000000002
really pushing onto the water on a

1379.52 --> 1382.1589999999999
molecular level

1380.559 --> 1383.9189999999999
because it just pushes against the

1382.159 --> 1385.2
rubber which equally divides the

1383.919 --> 1389.8400000000001
pressure and then

1385.2 --> 1389.8400000000001
most of it just moves past it

1392.72 --> 1399.84
is there if no pam cowell

1395.84 --> 1399.84
no no there isn't really

1401.28 --> 1408.6399999999999
it's just turbulence you see

1405.12 --> 1411.12
you ca globers constantly say

1408.64 --> 1411.8400000000001
like oh what is flat earther theory for

1411.12 --> 1415.039
this well

1411.84 --> 1416.1589999999999
we don't need any you see these things

1415.039 --> 1420.32
were made up

1416.159 --> 1422.4
by the global side to try and reinforce

1420.32 --> 1425.6789999999999
some of the consequences

1422.4 --> 1426.799
of having a spinning ball earth there

1425.679 --> 1430.0
are no such

1426.799 --> 1435.2
needs from a flat earth side

1430.0 --> 1438.559
to identify these natural phenomena

1435.2 --> 1438.559
okay there's no need for it

1439.36 --> 1442.6399999999999
so yeah people that happen to be flat

1442.0 --> 1444.559
earthers

1442.64 --> 1447.1200000000001
could basically attempt to try and

1444.559 --> 1447.12
explain

1447.36 --> 1454.32
weather phenomenon here on earth

1451.12 --> 1455.279
with the base assumption with the angle

1454.32 --> 1458.24
of approach

1455.279 --> 1459.12
of a flat earth right they can do that

1458.24 --> 1463.84
but it's not

1459.12 --> 1467.6
essential because we

1463.84 --> 1470.08
don't need the hurricanes to

1467.6 --> 1472.559
be there in order to reinforce some

1470.08 --> 1475.76
natural consequence of our model

1472.559 --> 1475.76
you see that's the difference

1477.12 --> 1484.84
right and then yeah we can explain

1481.279 --> 1488.72
things but that doesn't make them f e

1484.84 --> 1492.1589999999999
theory right

1488.72 --> 1495.039
because there is no direct relation

1492.159 --> 1501.8400000000001
to the earth and how it is shaped it's

1495.039 --> 1501.84
not necessary

1508.32 --> 1515.84
what the super straight earth or what

1510.32 --> 1515.84
are you saying

1517.52 --> 1529.84
orbiting of the sun oui that's

1532.799 --> 1537.52
i don't know if the sun directly has

1534.96 --> 1543.8400000000001
something to do with

1537.52 --> 1543.84
with hurricanes

1544.159 --> 1552.0800000000002
i think it has more to do with just

1548.4 --> 1555.8400000000001
the fluid dynamics of the realm layout

1552.08 --> 1558.32
where in response to heat

1555.84 --> 1559.84
differentials with which cause pressure

1558.32 --> 1563.84
systems

1559.84 --> 1566.24
how it that is divided on the earth

1563.84 --> 1568.1589999999999
and because of like mountain ranges

1566.24 --> 1571.2
blocking off passage of

1568.159 --> 1574.72
passage of flow yeah

1571.2 --> 1577.279
the whole thing is simply going to have

1574.72 --> 1579.52
the pressure build up move in a certain

1577.279 --> 1583.2
direction in certain regions and i think

1579.52 --> 1586.24
that that is really the cause of why

1583.2 --> 1589.279
hurricanes and such typically in certain

1586.24 --> 1592.48
regions go in a certain direction

1589.279 --> 1595.84
has to do with the dynamics the pressure

1592.48 --> 1598.0
dynamics on the earth

1595.84 --> 1599.4399999999998
where it arises and then how everything

1598.0 --> 1603.52
is laid out

1599.44 --> 1603.52
how it will move because of that

1610.96 --> 1614.24
you don't need a ball to have something

1612.559 --> 1616.8799999999999
orbiting well yeah you do

1614.24 --> 1618.0
actually that's the point of the word

1616.88 --> 1621.8400000000001
orbit orbit

1618.0 --> 1623.12
is not if you mean just moving in a

1621.84 --> 1625.1999999999998
circular path

1623.12 --> 1627.36
that doesn't make it an orbit an orbit

1625.2 --> 1632.48
is really kind of intricately

1627.36 --> 1636.1589999999999
tied into physicality assumption bias

1632.48 --> 1636.96
this very specific tied into physicality

1636.159 --> 1639.44
assumption by

1636.96 --> 1640.799
so if you say something is orbiting even

1639.44 --> 1644.0800000000002
the flat earth

1640.799 --> 1645.279
then your kind of physicality assumption

1644.08 --> 1648.1589999999999
biasing

1645.279 --> 1651.039
the sun to be like a physical object

1648.159 --> 1654.3990000000001
actually rotating physically around

1651.039 --> 1657.44
while the earth right

1654.399 --> 1658.9599999999998
so orbiting is not really the proper use

1657.44 --> 1661.8400000000001
of word

1658.96 --> 1664.08
when you're engaging in the realization

1661.84 --> 1666.84
of the holographic nature of the heavens

1664.08 --> 1670.399
and the celestial lights i wouldn't call

1666.84 --> 1673.84
that an orbit

1670.399 --> 1675.1999999999998
i mean the word is close enough but the

1673.84 --> 1678.399
word orbit

1675.2 --> 1681.2
just like gravity is subjected

1678.399 --> 1682.08
to constructs that are intricately tied

1681.2 --> 1686.96
into it through

1682.08 --> 1686.96
the literature you see

1687.279 --> 1690.559
it's too specific

1691.52 --> 1696.1589999999999
the sun orbits over fe oh really

1698.64 --> 1713.6000000000001
what's your evidence for that

1711.279 --> 1713.6
right

1714.399 --> 1724.8799999999999
right because yeah mechanically orbits

1718.0 --> 1728.0
require euclidean position

1724.88 --> 1731.919
you're not sledding the

1728.0 --> 1735.36
super straight earth good luck with that

1731.919 --> 1736.7990000000002
that's like me three or four years ago

1735.36 --> 1740.32
what is it

1736.799 --> 1742.08
saying no the baller stole gravity

1740.32 --> 1744.08
no i'm going to keep using the word

1742.08 --> 1745.4399999999998
gravity i know it's a mechanism but it's

1744.08 --> 1748.559
been

1745.44 --> 1751.6000000000001
mutated into this science fiction

1748.559 --> 1752.8799999999999
cornerstone and then i tried to defend

1751.6 --> 1754.399
it right

1752.88 --> 1756.96
but i didn't realize about the

1754.399 --> 1760.32
scientific method

1756.96 --> 1766.24
then to hold on to orbits it's

1760.32 --> 1770.72
it's to you can't save that word

1766.24 --> 1781.84
it's literally saying orb it

1770.72 --> 1781.84
to qualify you can't save that word

1784.72 --> 1788.32
i understand the intention but i'm just

1787.36 --> 1791.52
trying to

1788.32 --> 1791.52
be realistic here

1792.48 --> 1799.6
now look at the word orb

1795.679 --> 1801.8400000000001
it you know an orb

1799.6 --> 1808.24
yeah orb does mean ball yeah it's

1801.84 --> 1812.24
another word for ball

1808.24 --> 1812.24
[ __ ] me dude why are you so triggered

1814.64 --> 1822.72
i'm sorry i'm sorry if if i'm a little

1817.36 --> 1825.76
bit confronting

1822.72 --> 1829.84
orbit means going around well

1825.76 --> 1837.84
it mostly means going around a ball

1829.84 --> 1837.84
so calm down dude

1842.32 --> 1845.6789999999999
there you go pam cow

1848.48 --> 1852.799
dude stop stop the f-bombs this is

1851.36 --> 1865.84
ridiculous dude

1852.799 --> 1865.84
i don't know why you're so triggered

1871.679 --> 1875.679
i mean you don't like changing your

1874.159 --> 1878.3200000000002
lingo

1875.679 --> 1879.519
okay well dude nobody's gonna stop you

1878.32 --> 1882.32
from saying the sun

1879.519 --> 1883.76
is orbiting the flat earth you know the

1882.32 --> 1885.6
problem is though

1883.76 --> 1888.8799999999999
is that the word has a whole lot of

1885.6 --> 1892.24
baggage that's what i was trying to say

1888.88 --> 1892.88
right yeah we know what you mean but the

1892.24 --> 1895.84
word

1892.88 --> 1898.0800000000002
is just it's tainted with all kinds of

1895.84 --> 1900.1589999999999
machinations

1898.08 --> 1902.0
strongly grounded in physicality

1900.159 --> 1906.7990000000002
assumption bias and as

1902.0 --> 1909.919
pam cowell just looked it up yeah

1906.799 --> 1913.12
revolve around an arm orbit that

1909.919 --> 1916.3990000000001
so i'm sorry

1913.12 --> 1918.9599999999998
you have bad dude what's up with you

1916.399 --> 1922.4799999999998
today man

1918.96 --> 1922.48
had a bad night or something

1929.279 --> 1935.84
you're cooking dude no no it's just

1932.399 --> 1935.84
look at the word

1939.12 --> 1944.08
what are you gonna do next say oh the we

1941.36 --> 1947.1999999999998
can't let the globe or steal

1944.08 --> 1950.32
outer space like

1947.2 --> 1950.32
uh what

1950.72 --> 1957.1200000000001
how are you gonna rescue that word

1955.279 --> 1958.559
it's like a cornerstone of the

1957.12 --> 1962.9599999999998
machinations you can't

1958.559 --> 1967.44
you can't get it back

1962.96 --> 1971.919
if he has space really

1967.44 --> 1971.919
well maybe the flat earth society does

1972.72 --> 1978.32
but me

1975.84 --> 1981.1999999999998
my colleagues over at flat earth debates

1978.32 --> 1981.2
certainly don't

1988.0 --> 1992.64
what above 100 miles well who says there

1991.6 --> 1995.36
is anything above

1992.64 --> 1996.96
100 miles who says there is space to go

1995.36 --> 2000.8799999999999
into

1996.96 --> 2003.039
right part of our argument is that

2000.88 --> 2005.2
there is containment there is a limited

2003.039 --> 2007.039
volume or we couldn't have stable gas

2005.2 --> 2009.76
pressure

2007.039 --> 2011.2
because the gas when presented with

2009.76 --> 2013.039
infinite volume

2011.2 --> 2015.76
which is what outer space is supposed to

2013.039 --> 2017.84
be infinite volume

2015.76 --> 2019.84
it's just going to keep on rushing

2017.84 --> 2022.08
outward spreading out thinner and

2019.84 --> 2023.76
thinner to try and find an equilibrium

2022.08 --> 2025.279
with its container

2023.76 --> 2026.96
which would be infinite so it's never

2025.279 --> 2033.84
going to find it it's just going to

2026.96 --> 2033.8400000000001
expand into all directions

2044.84 --> 2047.84
so

2049.28 --> 2053.44
dude what's going on with you i thought

2051.52 --> 2055.04
i knew you man

2053.44 --> 2057.44
i've never heard you talk like this

2055.04 --> 2057.44
before

2058.24 --> 2065.7599999999998
no wonder or unless you're some suck

2061.359 --> 2066.56
[ __ ] this doesn't sound like you i've

2065.76 --> 2068.96
seen you around

2066.56 --> 2071.2
last year i don't understand why you're

2068.96 --> 2075.839
talking like this

2071.2 --> 2075.839
like really you believe in outer space

2077.119 --> 2081.28
yeah i don't know you that's right i

2079.2 --> 2084.48
definitely don't know you

2081.28 --> 2087.679
i thought that i had some grip

2084.48 --> 2090.96
through what i saw

2087.679 --> 2092.8
but yeah apparently you had another side

2090.96 --> 2096.399
to you that you hadn't shown yet

2092.8 --> 2096.3990000000003
i'm very surprised by this

2100.0 --> 2103.839
you believe it is more than a hundred

2102.16 --> 2107.2799999999997
miles high

2103.839 --> 2107.2799999999997
okay cool dude

2107.599 --> 2112.079
good for you some evidence would be

2109.76 --> 2113.92
great though

2112.079 --> 2116.4
also it's it's kind of important to

2113.92 --> 2119.52
realize that there is a limitation to

2116.4 --> 2122.7200000000003
the volume so yeah who knows maybe

2119.52 --> 2125.04
the volume is up to 100 miles high

2122.72 --> 2128.16
maybe a thousand miles does that mean

2125.04 --> 2128.16
that we can reach that

2128.839 --> 2134.88
no

2130.8 --> 2137.3590000000004
who knows how high it is

2134.88 --> 2138.32
what we do know however is it's not

2137.359 --> 2145.839
infinite

2138.32 --> 2145.839
it can't be

2146.24 --> 2151.7599999999998
all right pam cowell thanks for that

2148.32 --> 2151.76
don't know how you figured that out

2151.92 --> 2157.04
probably just youtube searched him

2157.119 --> 2163.44
where is the sun lester not drive

2160.56 --> 2163.68
no super straight earther the sun is not

2163.44 --> 2166.8
an

2163.68 --> 2170.24
object it's a hologram

2166.8 --> 2173.2000000000003
it's a holographic phenomenon

2170.24 --> 2174.0789999999997
there's literally light manifesting

2173.2 --> 2176.0789999999997
through a pretty

2174.079 --> 2177.44
incredible process that has not been

2176.079 --> 2180.0
understood

2177.44 --> 2181.28
it's manifesting in relation to the

2180.0 --> 2184.32
observers

2181.28 --> 2187.92
to any observation

2184.32 --> 2191.28
because the sun is in a unique

2187.92 --> 2193.92
position virtual position to every

2191.28 --> 2193.92
observer

2194.079 --> 2198.48
and all the light that comes from it

2196.64 --> 2200.0
everything that shines past and through

2198.48 --> 2203.52
the clouds and rainbows

2200.0 --> 2206.96
is this all unique

2203.52 --> 2206.96
uniquely holographic

2209.119 --> 2215.76
right you can't prove anything other

2212.56 --> 2218.72
than that you know why because

2215.76 --> 2220.88
where's the proof of physicality you

2218.72 --> 2222.72
know if it is a physical object then it

2220.88 --> 2226.4
should abide by certain

2222.72 --> 2228.48
rules euclidean position that means

2226.4 --> 2230.4
okay so if it's an object that means you

2228.48 --> 2233.92
can approach it you can reach

2230.4 --> 2235.839
its location technically

2233.92 --> 2237.52
or at least you could attempt to

2235.839 --> 2239.92
approach it and then you would see it

2237.52 --> 2243.44
grow in angular size

2239.92 --> 2246.56
right these are what physical things

2243.44 --> 2248.079
are like when you approach them they get

2246.56 --> 2249.92
bigger when you go away from them they

2248.079 --> 2253.599
get smaller

2249.92 --> 2257.04
right so where is the evidence

2253.599 --> 2258.48
of a position or a dist an actual

2257.04 --> 2260.16
distance of the sun

2258.48 --> 2262.2400000000002
there isn't any that's why it's a

2260.16 --> 2264.24
housekeeping question

2262.24 --> 2265.4399999999996
because you don't have any evidence that

2264.24 --> 2270.16
the sun is in an

2265.44 --> 2273.2000000000003
actual euclidean position over the earth

2270.16 --> 2274.16
or very far away either way you can't

2273.2 --> 2277.2799999999997
prove it because

2274.16 --> 2279.5989999999997
you can't determine an exact euclidean

2277.28 --> 2283.28
physician in space

2279.599 --> 2285.92
it's elusive because it's a hologram

2283.28 --> 2289.92
yes there is light manifesting yes it is

2285.92 --> 2291.76
reaching ground level being absorbed

2289.92 --> 2294.8
and to the observer has all kinds of

2291.76 --> 2297.3590000000004
unique shadow effects and all that

2294.8 --> 2299.119
but it's not coming from a provable

2297.359 --> 2301.839
physical literal position

2299.119 --> 2304.6400000000003
in space within the container somewhere

2301.839 --> 2304.64
or anywhere

2310.24 --> 2317.52
do i think i'm in the matrix no i just

2313.44 --> 2317.52
dude what the [ __ ] is up with you

2321.839 --> 2328.64
it is

2326.079 --> 2329.44
like there yeah yeah kind of like the

2328.64 --> 2332.48
horizon

2329.44 --> 2335.92
it's an optical manifestation

2332.48 --> 2339.44
now the horizon is caused

2335.92 --> 2342.32
more by resolution limits

2339.44 --> 2342.96
angle of approach the other effect right

2342.32 --> 2345.76
it is

2342.96 --> 2347.68
really visual inherent well the light

2345.76 --> 2349.28
from the sun and all the celestials is a

2347.68 --> 2352.3999999999996
bit different

2349.28 --> 2354.48
because they're not coming from

2352.4 --> 2356.8
euclidean positions they are light

2354.48 --> 2359.119
manifest

2356.8 --> 2361.119
like unique holographic light

2359.119 --> 2364.079
manifestation

2361.119 --> 2369.839
that somehow averages out by the way for

2364.079 --> 2369.8390000000004
everything everywhere

2377.359 --> 2382.72
all right but even if you try to

2380.839 --> 2387.04
triangulate

2382.72 --> 2390.3199999999997
a position for the sun or the moon

2387.04 --> 2394.56
right over the earth presupposing a very

2390.32 --> 2397.44
specific flat earth model the disk

2394.56 --> 2399.839
you literalize that and then you try to

2397.44 --> 2403.44
use triangulation to figure out the

2399.839 --> 2406.319
exact position of the sun or the moon

2403.44 --> 2406.96
yeah you might reach a conclusion by

2406.319 --> 2409.599
that

2406.96 --> 2411.04
by that baseline presupposition of the

2409.599 --> 2413.3590000000004
orientation of the earth

2411.04 --> 2415.52
that there what was it again 3 000 miles

2413.359 --> 2418.4
away

2415.52 --> 2418.72
yeah that could be but the thing is if

2418.4 --> 2421.359
you

2418.72 --> 2423.5989999999997
then move to that literal position or

2421.359 --> 2426.24
even towards it

2423.599 --> 2427.839
right there is no coral there is no

2426.24 --> 2431.2799999999997
necessary correlating

2427.839 --> 2432.64
angular size changes and that just goes

2431.28 --> 2436.5600000000004
to show

2432.64 --> 2436.56
it's not physically there

2437.04 --> 2439.839
it isn't

2440.4 --> 2445.119
it's just an angular manifestation that

2442.8 --> 2446.5600000000004
with a certain presupposition layout of

2445.119 --> 2449.92
the earth

2446.56 --> 2452.96
you can mistakingly think it is in a

2449.92 --> 2457.52
literal position over that earth when

2452.96 --> 2457.52
you approach it it isn't really there

2458.079 --> 2461.119
it's just angular

2461.359 --> 2465.52
oh it's a reflection oh really so

2463.52 --> 2466.8
reflection from where then how does that

2465.52 --> 2470.56
work out right

2466.8 --> 2473.119
i've heard that i've heard that before

2470.56 --> 2475.599
right i can't no i can't specifically

2473.119 --> 2478.839
dispel that

2475.599 --> 2480.2400000000002
because like what is the reflector why

2478.839 --> 2483.2799999999997
how

2480.24 --> 2486.0789999999997
but what i do know is the assumption

2483.28 --> 2487.119
bias of the sun being in a physical

2486.079 --> 2490.0
literal position

2487.119 --> 2492.079
it can be dispelled and i am dispelling

2490.0 --> 2492.079
it

2492.16 --> 2497.04
i have been trying to do that for years

2494.8 --> 2497.04
now

2498.24 --> 2503.2799999999997
hey good servant and james mason by the

2501.04 --> 2503.2799999999997
way

2507.44 --> 2510.48
past our perception of the well what

2509.599 --> 2512.6400000000003
about the

2510.48 --> 2515.359
inverse square law of light then super

2512.64 --> 2515.359
straight earther

2516.8 --> 2524.1600000000003
it's not correct in first square

2520.96 --> 2525.839
law of light dictates

2524.16 --> 2528.3999999999996
if you're at a certain distance from a

2525.839 --> 2530.48
light it will have a certain brightness

2528.4 --> 2531.6800000000003
and if you go closer then that

2530.48 --> 2535.68
brightness will

2531.68 --> 2540.64
in a very specific increasing pattern

2535.68 --> 2540.64
go up see you right

2541.04 --> 2544.72
where is that happening with the sun

2544.8 --> 2548.5600000000004
it isn't because it's not a literal

2547.599 --> 2550.8
light bulb

2548.56 --> 2552.64
thing in a euclidean position sending

2550.8 --> 2554.6400000000003
off blinding

2552.64 --> 2556.7999999999997
amounts of light and then when you go

2554.64 --> 2565.839
closer you will be more blinded

2556.8 --> 2565.8390000000004
no that doesn't happen

2577.52 --> 2585.119
what are you talking about

2581.04 --> 2585.119
no light has three dimension

2585.599 --> 2588.6400000000003
the third dimension of death is what are

2588.079 --> 2593.44
you

2588.64 --> 2597.1189999999997
talking about

2593.44 --> 2597.119
dude what have you been watching

2603.599 --> 2607.76
i mean are you doing okay because this

2605.68 --> 2608.56
is sounding really weird what's coming

2607.76 --> 2610.079
from you man

2608.56 --> 2612.48
it's like it sounds like you're really

2610.079 --> 2621.8390000000004
upset about something

2612.48 --> 2621.839
i don't know

2626.48 --> 2631.92
because we are enclosed light reflects

2628.88 --> 2635.599
you don't know that good servant

2631.92 --> 2638.8
the same euclidean effects

2635.599 --> 2641.6800000000003
would apply you ever seen

2638.8 --> 2642.96
an object being reflected in a mirror

2641.68 --> 2646.56
when you move

2642.96 --> 2648.8
towards the mirror

2646.56 --> 2650.4
perspective still applies because the

2648.8 --> 2654.079
total pathway

2650.4 --> 2656.88
object mirror u

2654.079 --> 2657.8390000000004
total pathway through the mirror is

2656.88 --> 2661.44
shortened so

2657.839 --> 2663.2
perspective still applies right

2661.44 --> 2664.88
you can't just say oh it's reflecting

2663.2 --> 2668.16
off a dome whatever

2664.88 --> 2670.1600000000003
and that's why you can't get there you

2668.16 --> 2672.8799999999997
can't

2670.16 --> 2674.16
no perspective applies oh yeah yeah yeah

2672.88 --> 2676.8
reflectors

2674.16 --> 2679.1189999999997
mirrors perspective applies oh yes it

2676.8 --> 2679.119
does

2686.72 --> 2691.839
right even with mirrors perspective

2689.04 --> 2691.839
applies

2692.16 --> 2695.44
ever thought about that mirrors don't

2694.96 --> 2697.599
just

2695.44 --> 2700.319
solve everything you don't have a mirror

2697.599 --> 2705.839
and then something is a hologram

2700.319 --> 2705.839
just like that

2709.68 --> 2719.839
perspective still applies

2727.359 --> 2733.839
height width and depth

2730.839 --> 2733.839
what

2741.52 --> 2744.96
that's me being no no that's not me

2743.52 --> 2748.16
being a ball win that's me

2744.96 --> 2749.839
genuinely being concerned about you dude

2748.16 --> 2752.16
i don't know what the hell is going on

2749.839 --> 2754.16
with this insane hostile attitude of

2752.16 --> 2756.96
yours

2754.16 --> 2756.96
i really don't

2757.76 --> 2764.4
i mean did i say something wrong

2761.359 --> 2769.04
guys good servant james

2764.4 --> 2772.319
mason pam cowell

2769.04 --> 2775.04
with tony whitcomb you julio of heaven

2772.319 --> 2776.88
you've been in chat kamikaze gilmore

2775.04 --> 2778.8
i've been having quite a long back and

2776.88 --> 2780.7200000000003
forth conversation with super straight

2778.8 --> 2789.8390000000004
earther here

2780.72 --> 2789.839
did i say something wrong

2792.16 --> 2799.04
perspective of three dimensions

2795.28 --> 2803.8390000000004
what the [ __ ] off my magic dude

2799.04 --> 2803.839
who the [ __ ] are you

2808.8 --> 2815.599
okay dude i uh

2811.92 --> 2819.2000000000003
you gotta go this [ __ ] at home [ __ ]

2815.599 --> 2822.88
i'm done with you man go [ __ ] yourself

2819.2 --> 2824.96
trying to be actually informative here

2822.88 --> 2825.839
help you out and you're being a piece of

2824.96 --> 2828.16
[ __ ]

2825.839 --> 2831.2
don't know what you don't know what meds

2828.16 --> 2834.319
you are off

2831.2 --> 2835.04
maybe you got rambled in by some stuff

2834.319 --> 2838.319
on yay

2835.04 --> 2841.839
that wanted to talk [ __ ] about me again

2838.319 --> 2841.839
something but this is insane

2842.319 --> 2846.88
just get the [ __ ] out no you don't talk

2844.48 --> 2850.8
to me like that ever

2846.88 --> 2853.92
nobody nobody does okay not even rasta

2850.8 --> 2853.92
hat and rasta hat

2855.359 --> 2860.88
yeah i give him a lot of personal

2857.68 --> 2863.5989999999997
freedom in his communication

2860.88 --> 2866.6400000000003
you just don't talk to me like that like

2863.599 --> 2866.6400000000003
get over yourself

2867.28 --> 2872.0
go outside take a nice breather calm

2870.839 --> 2874.7999999999997
down

2872.0 --> 2877.04
and remind yourself not to talk to me

2874.8 --> 2886.96
like that again

2877.04 --> 2891.359
right and maybe one day i'll unban you

2886.96 --> 2893.76
hello daily tea physics friday

2891.359 --> 2894.96
i don't know see your next discord

2893.76 --> 2899.6800000000003
server

2894.96 --> 2901.44
sorry when i'll talk about physics here

2899.68 --> 2915.839
that's just fine i have been talking

2901.44 --> 2915.839
about physics pretty much all the show

2919.04 --> 2922.72
all right thanks taking star water

2924.0 --> 2928.4
i'm just really shocked i thought super

2925.76 --> 2931.3590000000004
straight arthur was a great guy

2928.4 --> 2931.92
but he's just gone ballistic for some

2931.359 --> 2937.52
reason

2931.92 --> 2937.52
yeah that guy was tripping definitely

2940.96 --> 2945.76
it's the server that nathan runs as

2942.96 --> 2945.76
shown okay

2954.64 --> 2961.359
right but yeah daily t uh i'm just gonna

2958.16 --> 2963.52
go over to the flat earth debates

2961.359 --> 2965.92
a little over an hour so in little over

2963.52 --> 2965.92
an hour

2966.48 --> 2971.839
until then i'm just gonna try to focus

2968.64 --> 2971.839
on my show here

2990.559 --> 2992.88
right

2997.76 --> 3002.079
yeah he was taking up the whole show i

2999.76 --> 3006.7200000000003
know but don't worry

3002.079 --> 3006.7200000000003
because all his comments are still

3007.04 --> 3014.079
still over there in the yeah

3010.16 --> 3016.319
in the on-screen chat so

3014.079 --> 3018.0
you know it i thought it was a good

3016.319 --> 3021.119
discussion until he just went

3018.0 --> 3021.119
completely ballistic

3021.44 --> 3026.0
it's very odd to see well flat earther

3024.64 --> 3028.65
holding onto the word

3026.0 --> 3031.769
orbit that's just like what

3028.65 --> 3031.7690000000002
[Music]

3038.839 --> 3041.839
why

3055.119 --> 3069.839
i liked it yeah

3075.04 --> 3081.44
well it's no that's just wrong

3079.599 --> 3083.52
i like to dish it out i thought i was

3081.44 --> 3087.2000000000003
really polite i'm just being straight

3083.52 --> 3089.68
forward and hey when i

3087.2 --> 3090.319
that me saying like are you okay that's

3089.68 --> 3092.3999999999996
not me

3090.319 --> 3093.7599999999998
at homing or gaslighting like oh you

3092.4 --> 3097.28
must be [ __ ]

3093.76 --> 3099.119
no no that's me actually being a little

3097.28 --> 3100.079
worried because i thought it was a good

3099.119 --> 3102.319
guy

3100.079 --> 3102.319
okay

3103.359 --> 3108.839
so whoever saw that like don't be

3105.76 --> 3111.8390000000004
freaking paranoid i was genuinely

3108.839 --> 3111.839
concerned

3112.64 --> 3127.68
you have it on dude i have it here

3117.119 --> 3127.6800000000003
it's my show i can't say i didn't insult

3128.0 --> 3130.559
like what

3132.96 --> 3140.319
why am i getting angry guys

3138.079 --> 3141.76
like now there is a guy trying to

3140.319 --> 3144.5589999999997
gaslight

3141.76 --> 3146.3190000000004
really i'm angry am i am i so angry i

3144.559 --> 3148.7200000000003
had it was so

3146.319 --> 3149.839
under pressure man i had to quickly ban

3148.72 --> 3152.8799999999997
super straight earth

3149.839 --> 3155.839
because i was under so much pressure

3152.88 --> 3156.559
oh my god it's like i couldn't tell

3155.839 --> 3159.44
myself i

3156.559 --> 3160.0
was gonna go full rage win right because

3159.44 --> 3163.92
i'm so

3160.0 --> 3163.92
angry i'm so angry

3164.24 --> 3167.839
serious the [ __ ]

3173.76 --> 3181.8390000000004
yeah seeking star wars right said fu

3177.04 --> 3181.839
like three four times

3183.68 --> 3195.839
sarcastic cup wow somebody is being a

3187.04 --> 3195.839
little paranoid

3220.839 --> 3223.839
ugh

3234.839 --> 3237.839
uh

3248.4 --> 3251.839
hey agm

3269.44 --> 3273.599
yeah agm did you just see what just

3271.28 --> 3276.079
happened or you literally just came

3273.599 --> 3276.079
rolling in

3276.319 --> 3280.72
it was crazy super straight earther went

3278.559 --> 3283.44
all full on savanya and [ __ ]

3280.72 --> 3283.4399999999996
it's weird

3286.079 --> 3291.52
he thought that flat earthers or

3289.119 --> 3291.52
something

3291.68 --> 3294.799
that we shouldn't take the way orbits

3293.68 --> 3307.839
because it can mean

3294.799 --> 3311.839
other things that was really weird

3307.839 --> 3314.24
cocking on the word orbit

3311.839 --> 3314.24
wow

3316.72 --> 3321.68
it's not an insult to cover my cocking

3319.52 --> 3323.92
on the wood like what the [ __ ]

3321.68 --> 3325.7599999999998
oh i'm sorry i didn't know there was

3323.92 --> 3328.64
this religious

3325.76 --> 3329.3590000000004
important mission to retain the word

3328.64 --> 3332.48
orbit

3329.359 --> 3334.64
and to rescue it from heliocentric lingo

3332.48 --> 3337.28
i didn't know the word orbit had a

3334.64 --> 3339.44
critical future function in the

3337.28 --> 3345.52
communication of humanity

3339.44 --> 3345.52
that it's so important the [ __ ] is this

3347.04 --> 3350.72
no you're not getting a wrench

3350.96 --> 3358.559
no this needs to be

3354.72 --> 3362.9599999999996
seen this is real special boy

3358.559 --> 3365.28
effect this is this is study material

3362.96 --> 3365.28
guys

3366.16 --> 3377.839
don't you see it it's studying material

3369.2 --> 3377.839
you don't delete that

3388.839 --> 3393.839
what

3391.599 --> 3396.319
all right i didn't know that random

3393.839 --> 3396.319
explorer

3396.559 --> 3400.559
i don't know about those types of apps

3399.599 --> 3402.559
or any apps

3400.559 --> 3406.1600000000003
i don't know about about apps i don't

3402.559 --> 3406.1600000000003
have a phone with internet on it

3407.92 --> 3412.559
ballers define words how dare if he use

3410.72 --> 3416.839
their words

3412.559 --> 3419.28
well you can do it the problem is it is

3416.839 --> 3422.799
defined

3419.28 --> 3426.88
right it's defined very specifically

3422.799 --> 3426.88
defined centered around

3427.119 --> 3432.88
balls that's the problem like that's

3429.68 --> 3435.9199999999996
where it came from

3432.88 --> 3439.44
it's really a ball centric word

3435.92 --> 3442.2400000000002
orbit literally ball said literally

3439.44 --> 3447.839
mechanically ball centric it's crazy why

3442.24 --> 3447.839
would you want to rescue like that

3476.96 --> 3480.64
what do you call orbit around the pla

3478.88 --> 3484.319
there is no orbit

3480.64 --> 3489.2
around the plane there might be a

3484.319 --> 3491.44
circular trajectory

3489.2 --> 3491.4399999999996
right

3492.799 --> 3499.839
that doesn't make it in orbit orbit

3495.96 --> 3503.119
presupposes its physical

3499.839 --> 3506.24
falling around another ball

3503.119 --> 3508.7200000000003
in an orbit that's the problem it's very

3506.24 --> 3517.5989999999997
deeply defined within heliocentric

3508.72 --> 3519.359
thinking you can't rescue that word

3517.599 --> 3520.7200000000003
right because well you could call it a

3519.359 --> 3523.5989999999997
circuit

3520.72 --> 3525.839
a trajectory circuit yeah a pathway a

3523.599 --> 3527.839
circular pathway

3525.839 --> 3530.48
right but as soon as you say in orbit it

3527.839 --> 3532.48
immediately draws in

3530.48 --> 3534.72
the physical nature and the gravity

3532.48 --> 3536.96
presupposition and the balance between

3534.72 --> 3542.319
gravity's it's

3536.96 --> 3542.319
yeah it's newtonian in origin

3543.2 --> 3546.48
you can't take that away that's that's

3545.52 --> 3549.28
impossible

3546.48 --> 3549.76
to rescue that word because it was born

3549.28 --> 3559.8390000000004
deep

3549.76 --> 3559.8390000000004
into baller country

3571.599 --> 3575.599
huh while seeking star wars if you're

3575.119 --> 3578.96
going to say

3575.599 --> 3583.3590000000004
move over plane you're also also kind of

3578.96 --> 3585.92
assuming euclidean position

3583.359 --> 3588.0
say move over that kind of already

3585.92 --> 3589.839
suggests there's a physical thing in a

3588.0 --> 3592.4
specific position

3589.839 --> 3593.04
right when you just keep it purely

3592.4 --> 3596.0
visual

3593.04 --> 3598.4
which is the only data we really have

3596.0 --> 3601.599
about the celestial lights

3598.4 --> 3604.079
then a path or a circuit

3601.599 --> 3605.599
is a correct description because it is a

3604.079 --> 3608.559
description

3605.599 --> 3610.559
of a visual sighting right it's a

3608.559 --> 3613.92
pathway for the visual

3610.559 --> 3615.8390000000004
not asu automatically assuming if it to

3613.92 --> 3618.0
be a physical object in a physical

3615.839 --> 3620.88
euclidean position

3618.0 --> 3620.88
that's the difference

3622.96 --> 3629.839
hello gary webenga good to see you

3638.24 --> 3645.839
yeah hey agm like tiny wombo did

3642.64 --> 3645.839
he did just look it up

3655.28 --> 3663.119
sand path around evie

3659.68 --> 3671.839
around what there's a ascent path

3663.119 --> 3671.839
around effie what

3682.0 --> 3685.44
right but that you already said it

3684.079 --> 3688.559
that's the sun

3685.44 --> 3692.16
path over

3688.559 --> 3695.8390000000004
the flat earth or more accurately

3692.16 --> 3699.44
at the edge of vision of the observer

3695.839 --> 3702.4
right that doesn't need a ball

3699.44 --> 3703.2000000000003
but when you call it an orbit it does

3702.4 --> 3707.359
because it's

3703.2 --> 3709.7599999999998
intricately designed for that

3707.359 --> 3712.5589999999997
i'm sorry but that's just the way it is

3709.76 --> 3717.2000000000003
that's how it came to be

3712.559 --> 3717.2000000000003
it was born deep in baller country

3724.16 --> 3730.0
it's like weird comparison it's like

3727.039 --> 3733.599
trying to rescue a baby orc

3730.0 --> 3736.96
in the hopes it will grow up like an elf

3733.599 --> 3740.0
uh that's not gonna go

3736.96 --> 3754.0
without trouble it's probably

3740.0 --> 3755.92
more hassle than it's worth

3754.0 --> 3757.119
huh well thank you tiny wumbo for

3755.92 --> 3761.76
supporting my argument

3757.119 --> 3761.76
i appreciate that it's very honorable

3767.44 --> 3773.92
oh it means ecliptical path

3770.72 --> 3776.72
uh now you're quote mining

3773.92 --> 3779.039
it means more than that it's not just

3776.72 --> 3782.319
ecliptical path

3779.039 --> 3783.5200000000004
orbit applies implies a whole bunch of

3782.319 --> 3786.0
things

3783.52 --> 3787.52
can't just pick one thing in that and

3786.0 --> 3790.64
then say it's only that

3787.52 --> 3790.64
that's quote mining

3791.76 --> 3811.8390000000004
or cherry picking is it

3795.359 --> 3811.839
yeah it's cherry picking more

3812.799 --> 3818.4
what are you son makes a figure eight

3815.92 --> 3825.839
on its path what the hell are you

3818.4 --> 3825.839
talking about

3850.839 --> 3853.839
so

3855.119 --> 3863.599
now serfdart containment officer

3860.24 --> 3866.16
no this is not

3863.599 --> 3867.3590000000004
the sun on a flat earth that's the sun

3866.16 --> 3870.24
on a disk

3867.359 --> 3873.68
i already explained this extensively

3870.24 --> 3876.799
it's based on a triangulation process

3873.68 --> 3879.0389999999998
with a very specific disk model vantage

3876.799 --> 3883.119
point for the triangulation

3879.039 --> 3884.88
process which the combined angles

3883.119 --> 3886.96
the measurements of the position of the

3884.88 --> 3888.96
sun over the earth will lead to the

3886.96 --> 3892.559
conclusion that it is actually

3888.96 --> 3895.76
in in a sort of position

3892.559 --> 3896.2400000000002
in an exact angular position that adds

3895.76 --> 3898.7990000000004
up

3896.24 --> 3899.7599999999998
to what seems like a literal position on

3898.799 --> 3904.24
the model

3899.76 --> 3906.2400000000002
disk model of the flat earth right

3904.24 --> 3907.5989999999997
there's no proof that that model is

3906.24 --> 3910.9599999999996
literal that that is a

3907.599 --> 3914.48
euclidean representation of reality

3910.96 --> 3914.88
and there's no confirmation that the sun

3914.48 --> 3918.559
is

3914.88 --> 3919.28
actually in that exact triangulated

3918.559 --> 3923.52
position

3919.28 --> 3925.28
on that model right

3923.52 --> 3927.68
that's the whole issue with the disk

3925.28 --> 3927.6800000000003
model

3931.359 --> 3937.2
of course it's a great visualization

3934.799 --> 3937.92
to imagine how the world and everything

3937.2 --> 3941.359
we've learned

3937.92 --> 3944.4
could be different in relation to

3941.359 --> 3946.88
heliocentric universe thinking

3944.4 --> 3949.44
so it's a good alternative to kind of

3946.88 --> 3952.2400000000002
bend your mind away at first

3949.44 --> 3954.48
but it the reality is not as simple as

3952.24 --> 3954.4799999999996
that

3957.839 --> 3962.4
it's a bit more complicated to figure

3961.039 --> 3965.92
out what's actually

3962.4 --> 3967.839
literally going on and i've come to my

3965.92 --> 3970.96
own conclusions mainly that

3967.839 --> 3974.88
the sun and the moon

3970.96 --> 3978.2400000000002
and the planets and the stars are purely

3974.88 --> 3982.319
holographic phenomena purely light-based

3978.24 --> 3984.319
phenomena phenomena

3982.319 --> 3987.0389999999998
and they aren't actually in physical

3984.319 --> 3990.4
literal positions because you can't

3987.039 --> 3992.96
approach them and they'll grow bigger

3990.4 --> 4007.839
you can't pinpoint them to exact

3992.96 --> 4007.839
locations within euclidean space

4018.839 --> 4021.839
what

4024.799 --> 4031.52
the [ __ ] that's

4028.72 --> 4031.839
two completely different things a sphere

4031.52 --> 4035.0
of

4031.839 --> 4038.16
influence is a virtual

4035.0 --> 4042.0
representation of influence

4038.16 --> 4042.0
which is not a physical thing

4043.28 --> 4048.88
and who knows you could maybe literally

4045.359 --> 4052.24
see it as a sphere of influence

4048.88 --> 4054.88
it's just this presence

4052.24 --> 4055.4399999999996
that surrounds the sphere of influence

4054.88 --> 4058.799
and the

4055.44 --> 4060.0
closer you get easier you get gripped by

4058.799 --> 4062.799
it

4060.0 --> 4063.119
right that doesn't have anything to do

4062.799 --> 4066.16
with

4063.119 --> 4070.4
orbits an orbit is presupposed

4066.16 --> 4073.2799999999997
physical thing going in a circle

4070.4 --> 4073.839
around another physical thing which is

4073.28 --> 4076.2400000000002
probably

4073.839 --> 4077.44
yeah which should be spherical most most

4076.24 --> 4081.2799999999997
of the things

4077.44 --> 4084.2400000000002
out there right and then the supposed

4081.28 --> 4087.76
newtonian based gravity

4084.24 --> 4090.16
keeps the smaller thing in orbit

4087.76 --> 4091.92
of the bigger thing by making it yeah

4090.16 --> 4093.5989999999997
finding an equilibrium so it will keep

4091.92 --> 4095.76
falling around it

4093.599 --> 4099.04
that's how they describe it that's orbit

4095.76 --> 4099.04
it's that specific

4099.44 --> 4103.839
right there's nothing to like sphere of

4101.359 --> 4119.839
influence it's a description of

4103.839 --> 4119.839
a non-tangible thing

4123.839 --> 4132.239
the sphere in orbit is hypothetical

4127.839 --> 4134.64
what orbit works on the plane no he

4132.239 --> 4134.639999999999
doesn't

4145.199 --> 4147.839
dude

4149.679 --> 4153.759
maybe you should try like globe busters

4151.679 --> 4156.0
and bob and odell and such maybe you

4153.759 --> 4159.92
could get him to

4156.0 --> 4161.44
to go for that take the orbit back from

4159.92 --> 4164.64
the ball

4161.44 --> 4164.639999999999
i'm not gonna go there

4166.239 --> 4170.159
i mean i will probably describe things

4168.88 --> 4173.759
as an orbit by

4170.159 --> 4175.199
accident but i know that

4173.759 --> 4177.6
yes you should call it differently

4175.199 --> 4189.839
because of orbit does presuppose

4177.6 --> 4189.839
so much

4211.28 --> 4217.84
yeah dude just look up orbit it's

4214.88 --> 4217.84
very specific

4241.12 --> 4245.84
you did look up orben oh really

4259.84 --> 4264.719
quantum levitation oh my god

4265.44 --> 4267.759999999999
dude

4271.199 --> 4278.12
really god you're desperate for orbits

4276.08 --> 4280.08
so like oh you've been conditioned with

4278.12 --> 4281.04
heliocentrism and now you want your

4280.08 --> 4284.84
orbits back

4281.04 --> 4287.84
i don't know this is this isn't helping

4284.84 --> 4287.84
anybody

4312.84 --> 4315.84
so

4379.84 --> 4387.12
seven definitions of orbits what

4383.6 --> 4389.1990000000005
where really would

4387.12 --> 4390.96
would you like to summarize the seven

4389.199 --> 4399.839999999999
definitions of orbit

4390.96 --> 4399.84
with singular names

4410.84 --> 4413.84
so

4448.08 --> 4469.84
oh that's chewing gum i remember that

4451.76 --> 4469.84
yeah yeah i've seen that chewing gum

4494.84 --> 4497.84
so

4499.04 --> 4506.96
got some weird people in chat today man

4502.48 --> 4509.919999999999
that's just fine i'm not worried

4506.96 --> 4512.88
it's all just fine but it is very

4509.92 --> 4512.88
distracting though

4513.76 --> 4518.320000000001
it gets a little tiresome when you're

4515.36 --> 4519.5199999999995
just trying to convey common sense to

4518.32 --> 4523.5199999999995
somebody that's like

4519.52 --> 4539.84
clearly spiraling out of control

4523.52 --> 4539.84
i only have so much patience

4553.679 --> 4558.0
nathan thompson's who believed in a

4555.679 --> 4560.0
downward bias you could be

4558.0 --> 4567.84
i think he went on to the bob earth

4560.0 --> 4567.84
wagon with that

4578.84 --> 4581.84
hmm

4620.84 --> 4623.84
so

4634.84 --> 4637.84
so

4640.08 --> 4644.32
all right i'm just browsing around now

4642.56 --> 4646.4800000000005
just leaving the chat for a while

4644.32 --> 4651.84
because

4646.48 --> 4651.839999999999
it's getting a little tiresome

4672.8 --> 4676.96
all right by the way i think i rescued

4675.04 --> 4678.239
another person yesterday from getting

4676.96 --> 4680.4800000000005
the second corona

4678.239 --> 4680.48
shot

4681.76 --> 4693.84
so it's good

4739.76 --> 4744.8
yeah low colloquial acceleration and

4742.64 --> 4749.679
scientific acceleration yeah

4744.8 --> 4754.08
yeah i know

4749.679 --> 4754.08
right but you see

4754.96 --> 4760.2390000000005
before look maybe you even have a weird

4758.48 --> 4762.4
little point i just really don't think

4760.239 --> 4765.199
it's the right time for it

4762.4 --> 4766.719
right yeah maybe there are other ways

4765.199 --> 4769.199
that you could still describe

4766.719 --> 4770.4800000000005
orbit but the thing is it would be in

4769.199 --> 4775.12
orb

4770.48 --> 4778.48
like models presuppositions

4775.12 --> 4780.64
right like indeed an electron orbits the

4778.48 --> 4784.239
proton and neutron

4780.64 --> 4791.84
right but in that muscle they are

4784.239 --> 4791.839999999999
orbs okay

4794.08 --> 4801.28
yes yeah we're in the middle of a

4797.8 --> 4805.84
heliocentric religion

4801.28 --> 4805.84
this is not the time

4825.28 --> 4831.599999999999
not proteins protons

4828.48 --> 4832.879999999999
have i seen this no it's a model that's

4831.6 --> 4847.84
the point

4832.88 --> 4847.84
that's why i called it a model

4858.0 --> 4864.56
no but dude i'm not

4861.28 --> 4868.4
giving up the word i'm just bypassing it

4864.56 --> 4874.400000000001
don't need to use it there's other ways

4868.4 --> 4879.44
right it's called dynamics

4874.4 --> 4879.44
you can maneuver through the spectrum of

4886.84 --> 4889.84
words

4898.4 --> 4903.12
dude if you want to hold on to the word

4900.639 --> 4905.1990000000005
orbit then by all means dude

4903.12 --> 4906.239
become an orbit boomer if you want to be

4905.199 --> 4910.0
an orbit boomer

4906.239 --> 4911.199
and you wanna in 40 years still use the

4910.0 --> 4913.92
word orbit

4911.199 --> 4917.44
that's fine you go ahead and use the

4913.92 --> 4919.719
word orbit nobody's stopping you

4917.44 --> 4921.199
it's trying to inform you of the

4919.719 --> 4924.96
complications

4921.199 --> 4928.159
and the origin of the word that's all

4924.96 --> 4929.679
right doing this doesn't mean that these

4928.159 --> 4932.32
words are going to be

4929.679 --> 4934.32
like scrapped or something like it was

4932.32 --> 4937.44
some kind of communist

4934.32 --> 4940.239
regime okay you don't have to worry

4937.44 --> 4942.239
that words are gonna get scrapped it's

4940.239 --> 4947.12
simply being

4942.239 --> 4950.4
figured out and then

4947.12 --> 4952.4
chosen or avoided

4950.4 --> 4954.48
because where there's a project going on

4952.4 --> 4959.28
there's an awakening happening where

4954.48 --> 4962.638999999999
things that we are trying to

4959.28 --> 4966.159
figure out publicly what things mean

4962.639 --> 4969.679
how things work and how they don't work

4966.159 --> 4973.28
and then find the best oversight

4969.679 --> 4975.28
the best way to approach it so that you

4973.28 --> 4976.4
understand the most and remember it the

4975.28 --> 4978.639
best

4976.4 --> 4981.28
and for that you gotta avoid certain

4978.639 --> 4984.84
words that have a wide association

4981.28 --> 4987.84
like the word orbit so it's just

4984.84 --> 4987.84
tactical

4995.76 --> 5005.52
gave up the word space oh my god

5001.52 --> 5015.84
dude space is fake

5005.52 --> 5015.84
doesn't exist there is no endless vacuum

5021.92 --> 5028.0
a couple hundred years oh yeah yeah yeah

5026.0 --> 5030.0
tiny one well that's that's what people

5028.0 --> 5033.04
said

5030.0 --> 5035.84
what would happen in 50 years

5033.04 --> 5037.5199999999995
during the moon landing right oh yeah of

5035.84 --> 5038.639
course there's going to be a mars base

5037.52 --> 5041.679
and

5038.639 --> 5043.52
regular flights to the moon base yeah

5041.679 --> 5045.04
that's what they said would be going on

5043.52 --> 5047.6
in 50 years back then

5045.04 --> 5049.28
tiny wumbo you remember that remember

5047.6 --> 5051.6
how that was going around and people

5049.28 --> 5054.719
really thought that

5051.6 --> 5057.92
right enforced by movies too

5054.719 --> 5061.04
and [ __ ] yeah yeah

5057.92 --> 5063.28
no in 50 years we're not going to have a

5061.04 --> 5064.8
base on mars and then it'll be like oh

5063.28 --> 5068.159
mars is flat haha it's

5064.8 --> 5071.4400000000005
really funny no it's fake it really

5068.159 --> 5074.638999999999
is fake it's always going to be

5071.44 --> 5077.44
fake and if they fake it that will never

5074.639 --> 5079.6
be real it's always going to be fake

5077.44 --> 5079.919999999999
like the moon landing is always going to

5079.6 --> 5085.84
be

5079.92 --> 5085.84
fake right

5087.28 --> 5091.599999999999
so who knows if they're gonna try

5089.199 --> 5095.28
similar scenario to fool the world

5091.6 --> 5096.320000000001
and maybe with mars find some spot on

5095.28 --> 5100.0
the earth

5096.32 --> 5100.5599999999995
to do yeah to do the cinematography over

5100.0 --> 5102.48
again

5100.56 --> 5104.88
like with the moon but this time with

5102.48 --> 5104.879999999999
mars

5107.52 --> 5113.92
basically they're already doing that

5111.12 --> 5116.32
snippets they just don't want to commit

5113.92 --> 5120.8
too much

5116.32 --> 5120.799999999999
but they might at some point fully do

5124.84 --> 5130.08
that

5127.12 --> 5131.36
you'll use the word orbit to piss off

5130.08 --> 5134.48
dude go ahead dude

5131.36 --> 5137.92
it's dude that's your lingo

5134.48 --> 5141.36
if you want to use the word orbit

5137.92 --> 5142.159
misuse it you know if it's your favorite

5141.36 --> 5144.239
word dude

5142.159 --> 5146.159
i'm not trying to take your orbit away

5144.239 --> 5148.799999999999
i'm just trying to clarify what it

5146.159 --> 5148.799999999999
really means

5149.04 --> 5155.84
where it's coming from that's all

5178.0 --> 5185.84
yes fair toward containment officer

5182.159 --> 5197.839999999999
evidence of a liquid caramel

5185.84 --> 5197.84
mars core

5226.94 --> 5230.07
[Music]

5236.84 --> 5239.84
hmm

5249.52 --> 5253.84
huh really

5254.88 --> 5260.8
i had no idea i didn't know that an

5258.239 --> 5261.759999999999
orbit was also part of physiology

5260.8 --> 5266.719
terminology

5261.76 --> 5269.12
that's weird huh

5266.719 --> 5270.159
so the the but isn't that just called an

5269.12 --> 5273.599999999999
eye socket

5270.159 --> 5273.599999999999
and i guess eye socket

5273.92 --> 5281.84
adds orbit as another terminology for it

5277.84 --> 5281.84
or something that's weird

5287.76 --> 5291.280000000001
but then again it's yeah as you say

5290.0 --> 5293.52
socket orbital

5291.28 --> 5294.32
means socket that makes sense because

5293.52 --> 5297.1990000000005
look

5294.32 --> 5297.92
where did they get the idea of an orbit

5297.199 --> 5300.799999999999
from

5297.92 --> 5303.4400000000005
it is kind of like a socket right what's

5300.8 --> 5305.84
what's the thing about a socket

5303.44 --> 5306.719
there's a ball and then there's a socket

5305.84 --> 5309.84
and they fit

5306.719 --> 5310.96
and they are in lock step with one

5309.84 --> 5314.88
another right

5310.96 --> 5317.04
it's a ball joint thing socket

5314.88 --> 5319.04
well an orbit is supposed to be like

5317.04 --> 5321.04
that two layers

5319.04 --> 5323.04
one layer outside and the orb on the

5321.04 --> 5326.4
inside and then it's supposed to be

5323.04 --> 5329.92
moving steadily and smoothly around

5326.4 --> 5332.4
that thing so it was probably derived

5329.92 --> 5332.4
from that

5333.76 --> 5339.84
partially semantically at least i would

5336.8 --> 5339.84
say it's interesting

5344.32 --> 5348.84
right well we've got to realize when

5346.719 --> 5352.8
when you create something a new

5348.84 --> 5354.96
thing it's usually comes

5352.8 --> 5356.320000000001
inspired from something that already

5354.96 --> 5358.4
exists

5356.32 --> 5361.44
you know most heliocentric things are

5358.4 --> 5361.44
all derived from

5361.76 --> 5368.8
creation that's inspired by creation

5365.92 --> 5368.8
ironic isn't it

5373.199 --> 5379.839999999999
anyway thanks for that details you can

5374.96 --> 5379.84
start water very interesting

5380.159 --> 5393.839999999999
i mean he brought it up

5430.32 --> 5438.0
oh my god

5434.719 --> 5438.0
who are you talking to

5438.239 --> 5442.239
someone the other day about plane

5440.0 --> 5446.08
flights and he said that the planes

5442.239 --> 5446.08
orbit the earth oh my god

5446.84 --> 5453.4400000000005
why dude that's like some

5450.56 --> 5456.719
satellite there's like satellite

5453.44 --> 5460.0
thinking infiltration going on

5456.719 --> 5461.92
are is the satellite faction

5460.0 --> 5463.52
of the globe called and hey there's a

5461.92 --> 5466.719
whole bunch of people that

5463.52 --> 5467.1990000000005
freaking love satellites built it and

5466.719 --> 5469.12
[ __ ]

5467.199 --> 5471.12
thought yeah that's out there floating

5469.12 --> 5473.5199999999995
because they built it and then

5471.12 --> 5474.159
left it for somebody to put in a rocket

5473.52 --> 5478.080000000001
and launch

5474.159 --> 5478.08
but they don't know really what happened

5478.88 --> 5485.08
are the satelists satellite fans

5482.88 --> 5486.400000000001
the satellite cold are they trying to

5485.08 --> 5488.4
re-infiltrate

5486.4 --> 5489.44
flat earth and make it possible again

5488.4 --> 5493.28
because i

5489.44 --> 5493.28
i took notice even that in the

5493.6 --> 5498.4800000000005
the convex earth documentary with bilu

5497.52 --> 5501.1990000000005
and everything

5498.48 --> 5503.36
that they did that too that they said

5501.199 --> 5504.48
satellites do exist and they float up

5503.36 --> 5507.839999999999
there they orbit

5504.48 --> 5511.839999999999
up there over the convex earth

5507.84 --> 5511.84
so are the the satellite

5513.6 --> 5518.4800000000005
cultists are they trying to infiltrate

5516.88 --> 5521.4400000000005
the flat earth

5518.48 --> 5522.5599999999995
basically demand the virtual possibility

5521.44 --> 5525.199
of satellites to be

5522.56 --> 5526.080000000001
real even on a flat earth is that

5525.199 --> 5529.199
happening

5526.08 --> 5532.48
i would not be surprised

5529.199 --> 5536.239
because the idea of satellites has been

5532.48 --> 5539.5199999999995
enormously profitable so

5536.239 --> 5542.5599999999995
there's a whole group of people

5539.52 --> 5544.639
that make money of that that don't want

5542.56 --> 5546.320000000001
that idea to fade away

5544.639 --> 5549.4400000000005
because the earth is flat they gotta

5546.32 --> 5549.44
have their satellites

5550.56 --> 5554.2390000000005
so yeah i would be surprised

5554.96 --> 5561.84
it's pretty bizarre to see it happen

5558.84 --> 5561.84
though

5564.32 --> 5569.04
balloons are sadly well you don't know

5566.159 --> 5569.04
that wear blues

5570.639 --> 5574.400000000001
some satellites could be balloons but i

5573.28 --> 5579.12
think that most

5574.4 --> 5582.08
satellite activity is basically

5579.12 --> 5584.48
very efficient long distance radio

5582.08 --> 5584.48
towers

5585.36 --> 5590.4
which comparatively is incredibly cheap

5588.0 --> 5593.36
to maintain

5590.4 --> 5593.759999999999
right so it's profitable so they want to

5593.36 --> 5596.159
keep

5593.76 --> 5598.08
the satellites alive in people's minds

5596.159 --> 5599.92
so that if they say oh we're going to

5598.08 --> 5600.639
use this satellite for the reach that

5599.92 --> 5604.32
they'll be all

5600.639 --> 5605.1990000000005
enthusiastic and dream about a satellite

5604.32 --> 5607.759999999999
launch

5605.199 --> 5609.44
which will make it okay to them that the

5607.76 --> 5613.360000000001
price might be a little high

5609.44 --> 5613.36
right that's the sales trick

5615.04 --> 5622.32
and i i've mixed feelings about this

5618.08 --> 5622.32
in one hand yeah it is kind of

5623.28 --> 5631.84
an interesting dream to sell

5626.639 --> 5631.84
on the other hand it is still a lie

5642.84 --> 5645.84
right

5653.679 --> 5657.6
why are so many people really how many

5657.04 --> 5661.84
people

5657.6 --> 5661.84
are doing that good servant

5662.08 --> 5673.84
and i'll get back to you about that in

5664.32 --> 5673.84
two minutes

5698.84 --> 5701.84
so

5768.84 --> 5772.8
yes right

5770.239 --> 5772.799999999999
and i'm back

5782.84 --> 5785.52
oh

5784.159 --> 5787.92
i kind of hope that you would have

5785.52 --> 5790.320000000001
answered my question before i went away

5787.92 --> 5793.679
good servant

5790.32 --> 5794.96
like what why are so many people joining

5793.679 --> 5798.56
the freemasons

5794.96 --> 5800.88
how how when who what are you talking

5798.56 --> 5800.88
about

5807.04 --> 5810.639
are you just talking in general because

5809.679 --> 5813.84
you don't know

5810.639 --> 5817.28
how many people are and in what way

5813.84 --> 5819.360000000001
then unless you just recently caught on

5817.28 --> 5821.199
to something happening

5819.36 --> 5823.199
notice like oh yeah a whole bunch of

5821.199 --> 5825.119
people joined them

5823.199 --> 5828.799999999999
unless you just found that out then i

5825.119 --> 5828.799999999999
don't know why you would say that

5834.159 --> 5838.48
i mean is there some kind of a new

5836.08 --> 5841.679
recruiting

5838.48 --> 5844.08
phase going on you have

5841.679 --> 5846.719
any insight on it whatsoever or are you

5844.08 --> 5855.84
just randomly saying something

5846.719 --> 5855.84
i want to know good servant

5866.84 --> 5869.84
what

5880.84 --> 5883.84
what

5887.76 --> 5892.719
yeah wire blues i'm i'm kind of puzzled

5890.32 --> 5897.84
buddy what he just said as well

5892.719 --> 5897.84
sounded really weird

5900.32 --> 5907.119
hey roy is i i've known

5903.84 --> 5911.52
good servant for quite a

5907.119 --> 5916.159
long time now

5911.52 --> 5916.159000000001
i have demands you know

5920.239 --> 5923.5199999999995
there's a certain code of conduct don't

5922.88 --> 5925.6
just

5923.52 --> 5927.84
generally blabber out something if you

5925.6 --> 5930.88
don't know anything about it

5927.84 --> 5934.08
if you got some data hint to lead to

5930.88 --> 5939.84
saying such a thing if you got a point

5934.08 --> 5939.84
then that's fine

5940.0 --> 5943.6
it's this is me helping good servant to

5943.199 --> 5945.919999999999
stay

5943.6 --> 5948.400000000001
sharp because he does kind of need that

5945.92 --> 5948.4
sometimes

5949.28 --> 5952.88
and i think he does appreciate it when i

5951.6 --> 5954.88
do it when i don't

5952.88 --> 5956.88
over push him you know that ha that's

5954.88 --> 5960.719
that has happened a couple of times too

5956.88 --> 5967.28
it's i'm just

5960.719 --> 5970.4800000000005
trying to do the right thing here

5967.28 --> 5973.28
but yeah sphere tart says something

5970.48 --> 5975.919999999999
really weird

5973.28 --> 5978.5599999999995
so they say satellites are constantly

5975.92 --> 5994.08
falling but a plane isn't falling

5978.56 --> 5996.8
it never reaches the horizon one

5994.08 --> 5997.36
technically whatever reaches the horizon

5996.8 --> 6001.6
well it

5997.36 --> 6001.599999999999
it eventually dissolves into it

6006.84 --> 6009.84
right

6014.639 --> 6019.1990000000005
all right and decide on a few drawings

6017.52 --> 6023.6
the autographic view yeah

6019.199 --> 6025.919999999999
in that it's a sphere and

6023.6 --> 6027.1990000000005
it also excludes perspective because of

6025.92 --> 6031.84
the side on view

6027.199 --> 6035.44
so what the ball trenchers did

6031.84 --> 6036.2390000000005
is or well it's not even the trenches

6035.44 --> 6040.799999999999
it's above that

6036.239 --> 6044.08
they used their perspective

6040.8 --> 6045.4400000000005
excluding and replacing curvature

6044.08 --> 6048.5599999999995
calculator

6045.44 --> 6054.159
and aside on autographic view

6048.56 --> 6054.159000000001
to replace optic inherent effects

6054.719 --> 6059.28
and replace them with earth curvature in

6057.679 --> 6065.84
the side view model

6059.28 --> 6065.84
that's what they did that's their trick

6067.92 --> 6071.4400000000005
this has nothing to do with satellites

6069.76 --> 6074.88
by the way at all

6071.44 --> 6077.919999999999
right satellites it presupposes

6074.88 --> 6079.679
the earth is fair to begin with and that

6077.92 --> 6083.1990000000005
there is

6079.679 --> 6085.04
gravity which decreases in strength

6083.199 --> 6086.5599999999995
over distance from the center of the

6085.04 --> 6089.8
earth

6086.56 --> 6091.52
so that at some point there will be an

6089.8 --> 6094.96
equilibrium between

6091.52 --> 6094.96
attractive forces

6095.6 --> 6104.400000000001
of an object over the earth

6098.96 --> 6107.76
over the ball and it will effectively

6104.4 --> 6111.199
fall around it in a circle

6107.76 --> 6111.1990000000005
never reaching it

6111.36 --> 6121.839999999999
that's literally the idea

6114.4 --> 6121.839999999999
of an orbit the satellite orbit

6122.88 --> 6126.0
right it doesn't it's not compatible

6125.28 --> 6128.639
with anything

6126.0 --> 6130.0
flat because then it would just be

6128.639 --> 6131.6
moving over

6130.0 --> 6135.44
it has nothing to do with an orbit it's

6131.6 --> 6139.1990000000005
not falling it's not gravity less

6135.44 --> 6139.199
it's just moving in a path

6139.44 --> 6142.5599999999995
now we're talking about planes or

6141.36 --> 6146.159
balloon or whatever

6142.56 --> 6149.4400000000005
right zeppelin it could move in a path

6146.159 --> 6152.799999999999
that's not an orbit that's a path

6149.44 --> 6155.5199999999995
because it's not without gravity

6152.8 --> 6157.04
it's not around a sphere and it's not

6155.52 --> 6159.280000000001
falling around it

6157.04 --> 6160.719
automatically it because there is no

6159.28 --> 6163.599999999999
thrust

6160.719 --> 6166.08
required it's just falling around it

6163.6 --> 6170.56
that's the idea of an orbit

6166.08 --> 6170.5599999999995
that doesn't happen on a flat earth it

6174.84 --> 6177.84
can't

6188.84 --> 6191.84
this

6196.88 --> 6200.159000000001
ah thanks wire blues yeah thanks for

6199.199 --> 6203.5199999999995
being here

6200.159 --> 6207.759999999999
and i hope you appreciated it

6203.52 --> 6210.4800000000005
don't forget that to rogens it up

6207.76 --> 6210.96
also yeah i can still use support for

6210.48 --> 6213.04
any

6210.96 --> 6215.76
anybody who thinks this is actually

6213.04 --> 6219.36
worth your time

6215.76 --> 6221.6
uh i do require

6219.36 --> 6225.44
money periodically to basically keep

6221.6 --> 6227.76
going this is effectively my job

6225.44 --> 6230.4
and my pay comes from what people are

6227.76 --> 6233.76
willing to give me for it

6230.4 --> 6236.96
so please do keep our wind fed

6233.76 --> 6238.56
and motivated to keep going by donating

6236.96 --> 6241.6
to the paypal

6238.56 --> 6243.280000000001
if you can you know not if you're poor

6241.6 --> 6245.1990000000005
even if you're really like me i don't

6243.28 --> 6261.84
want you to

6245.199 --> 6261.839999999999
spend your last bucks to give

6287.36 --> 6290.48
what the hell

6290.639 --> 6300.159000000001
the freaking mic just went dead

6295.28 --> 6303.44
just like that really weird

6300.159 --> 6304.4
typical i was just about to say like

6303.44 --> 6306.4
yeah please

6304.4 --> 6308.5599999999995
support me through the paypal if you

6306.4 --> 6311.839999999999
like what i'm doing if you appreciate

6308.56 --> 6311.84
did that all get muted

6313.44 --> 6319.04
great so yeah if you really do

6315.6 --> 6319.04
appreciate my efforts here

6320.639 --> 6324.8
and you like this and you want this to

6322.4 --> 6327.119
keep going then i please urge you

6324.8 --> 6329.28
anybody that can just keep supporting me

6327.119 --> 6332.799999999999
through the paypal specifically

6329.28 --> 6335.44
because that comes that arrives directly

6332.8 --> 6338.0
and keep me fed and keep me motivated to

6335.44 --> 6341.28
keep this going and hopefully

6338.0 --> 6341.28
keep improving as well

6341.6 --> 6345.84
i think i have improved in many ways

6346.56 --> 6349.92
it's at the illuminati trying to silence

6348.4 --> 6352.4
me why dude

6349.92 --> 6354.4800000000005
i thought it was just like i was

6352.4 --> 6357.679
literally just trying to advertise for

6354.48 --> 6360.0
myself and my support a little

6357.679 --> 6360.88
and then it turned out to be muted so

6360.0 --> 6362.8
yeah

6360.88 --> 6366.88
that gave me that did give me a little

6362.8 --> 6366.88
bit of the illuminati feeling yeah

6370.84 --> 6373.84
typical

6380.239 --> 6384.5599999999995
but i don't know what this is but with

6382.48 --> 6387.839999999999
this mic sometimes i just need to

6384.56 --> 6391.280000000001
quickly get into obs and then

6387.84 --> 6391.28
switch around the source

6391.52 --> 6396.719
if i do that so it's like two approaches

6394.8 --> 6398.719
to the same source in the list it's like

6396.719 --> 6399.199
a default and then there's like the yeti

6398.719 --> 6401.6
mic

6399.199 --> 6402.799999999999
specific you have to switch back and

6401.6 --> 6407.280000000001
forth because sometimes

6402.8 --> 6415.84
it just snaps in the middle of

6407.28 --> 6415.84
me doing the show it's really weird

6418.639 --> 6422.2390000000005
that's why i have to keep my eye on the

6421.119 --> 6425.5199999999995
sound bar

6422.239 --> 6426.638999999999
in the mixer in obs to see that it keeps

6425.52 --> 6428.8
moving

6426.639 --> 6430.639
it's very important it stops moving then

6428.8 --> 6432.8
that means there's no sound coming

6430.639 --> 6432.8
through

6436.0 --> 6439.44
sometimes i don't spot it

6439.52 --> 6443.360000000001
but i really appreciate that you guys in

6441.679 --> 6445.679
chat do

6443.36 --> 6448.08
remind me as quick as possible when that

6445.679 --> 6448.08
happens

6451.119 --> 6457.759999999999
speech oil the

6454.84 --> 6459.76
no i think steemit it has something to

6457.76 --> 6461.4400000000005
do with the wiring perhaps because it

6459.76 --> 6465.04
seems to happen every time i

6461.44 --> 6466.5599999999995
fool around with it move it so maybe it

6465.04 --> 6468.56
has something to do with the wire that

6466.56 --> 6471.76
it accidentally disconnects and

6468.56 --> 6477.119000000001
reconnects and then it gets

6471.76 --> 6477.119000000001
that that somehow re-routes

6477.6 --> 6485.84
the source of it then i have to reset it

6480.8 --> 6485.84
it's weird

6496.84 --> 6504.159000000001
so

6499.36 --> 6504.159
right the gliders gliders are pretty

6510.84 --> 6517.360000000001
amazing

6513.679 --> 6521.1990000000005
right yeah and with gliders specifically

6517.36 --> 6523.599999999999
just like with birds they thrive on

6521.199 --> 6525.44
hot air so specifically in the summer

6523.6 --> 6526.639
when there's a lot of hot air rising

6525.44 --> 6531.599999999999
during the day

6526.639 --> 6531.6
yeah they can stay up incredibly long

6532.239 --> 6535.678999999999
pretty much until dark and then things

6534.08 --> 6538.84
start to cool down and yeah it

6535.679 --> 6540.159
gets too dangerous to fly the glider at

6538.84 --> 6542.2390000000005
night

6540.159 --> 6543.759999999999
but yeah summer that's why you see them

6542.239 --> 6546.239
around in summer time

6543.76 --> 6546.2390000000005
mostly

6550.159 --> 6555.839999999999
right george sanford yeah that's what i

6551.92 --> 6555.84
think too

6558.8 --> 6563.28
there might be there might be a wiring

6560.96 --> 6563.28
issue

6564.08 --> 6568.0
maybe the wires the connection is not

6566.08 --> 6583.84
entirely stable

6568.0 --> 6583.84
but whatever i'll learn to live with it

6594.84 --> 6597.84
right

6602.639 --> 6606.0
would ballers need to think planes are

6604.56 --> 6610.4800000000005
constantly falling

6606.0 --> 6612.679
cause of gravity no

6610.48 --> 6614.718999999999
no they compartment like they know about

6612.679 --> 6618.2390000000005
aerodynamics

6614.719 --> 6618.2390000000005
i was just pushing on the air

6620.159 --> 6627.44
now orbits are all about

6623.76 --> 6629.92
where outside of the gas region

6627.44 --> 6630.638999999999
most of it like the less gas the more

6629.92 --> 6633.679
successful

6630.639 --> 6635.84
in orbit because the gas causes a

6633.679 --> 6638.56
friction

6635.84 --> 6641.04
and friction eventually collapses the

6638.56 --> 6641.04
orbit

6642.32 --> 6647.119
so a real orbit is mostly outside of the

6646.719 --> 6649.36
gas

6647.119 --> 6651.5199999999995
influence so that it can keep on going

6649.36 --> 6652.0
and going forever without any friction

6651.52 --> 6655.599
slowing

6652.0 --> 6655.599
it down and collapsing the orbit

6660.639 --> 6668.4800000000005
what judy of heaven i

6664.96 --> 6668.4800000000005
don't even know what that means

6669.76 --> 6674.0
dude if i wanted to perfect my sound

6671.84 --> 6678.719
setup i would have to have like a sound

6674.0 --> 6681.52
guy that really knows how to tweak it

6678.719 --> 6682.159
i've seen them do that like hey my

6681.52 --> 6685.52
mother

6682.159 --> 6688.638999999999
was a music teacher and we we

6685.52 --> 6691.280000000001
learn about studio people right

6688.639 --> 6695.84
they can get everything perfect that's

6691.28 --> 6695.84
that's what they do

6700.88 --> 6705.04
you mean a vacuum orbit what a vacuum

6703.28 --> 6707.44
orbit

6705.04 --> 6709.36
supposedly within heliocentrism is the

6707.44 --> 6712.08
only thing that can keep on going

6709.36 --> 6715.199
without friction breaking down the orbit

6712.08 --> 6716.48
and they even use that concept by saying

6715.199 --> 6719.678999999999
because the iss

6716.48 --> 6722.159
is not in a vacuum it has to keep on

6719.679 --> 6725.92
getting boosted back up again

6722.159 --> 6725.92
because it is slowing down

6727.44 --> 6731.119
because of the slight air friction right

6730.32 --> 6733.679
has to be

6731.119 --> 6735.04
kept boosted up in the in the in the

6733.679 --> 6740.2390000000005
same path

6735.04 --> 6740.239
otherwise it'll crash that's the idea

6748.159 --> 6751.679
all right like to work for you thanks

6750.08 --> 6756.08
for being here tiny bumble

6751.679 --> 6756.08
it's been you've been helpful thanks

6758.32 --> 6765.84
hope it was interesting

6774.56 --> 6780.320000000001
who boosts the ice i don't know the

6777.599 --> 6780.32
astronauts

6780.96 --> 6784.8
i think they just have a couple of

6782.639 --> 6786.56
maneuvering thrusters on there

6784.8 --> 6788.4800000000005
and then they just boost it up i don't

6786.56 --> 6790.2390000000005
know they might have not even developed

6788.48 --> 6794.0
it that far

6790.239 --> 6796.0
you know but i've heard it before

6794.0 --> 6797.92
i've heard it said before like yeah the

6796.0 --> 6800.96
iss officially uses

6797.92 --> 6804.08
boosters periodically

6800.96 --> 6806.4
to not fall into lower earth orbit and

6804.08 --> 6810.719
then crash

6806.4 --> 6810.719
that's part of the narrative i think

6812.639 --> 6817.679
or maybe that's just what the what the

6815.599 --> 6821.84
trenches came up with i'm not sure if

6817.679 --> 6821.84
that is really official

6824.4 --> 6829.28
russian hackers what the hell dude

6831.199 --> 6840.5599999999995
why would russian hackers do that

6834.88 --> 6840.56
the iss is a joint project with russia

6842.159 --> 6845.759999999999
you didn't think that one through did

6846.84 --> 6849.84
you

6851.44 --> 6856.0
right it would just be russian computer

6854.88 --> 6858.96
engineers

6856.0 --> 6860.96
it's not hackers because it's partially

6858.96 --> 6863.84
their work

6860.96 --> 6863.84
officially

6875.44 --> 6879.44
do yeah seeking star wars it's it's

6877.76 --> 6881.1990000000005
crazy

6879.44 --> 6884.239
right because what's the best thing you

6881.199 --> 6888.159
can compare to the iss

6884.239 --> 6890.48
scenario wise it's a submarine

6888.159 --> 6893.28
well you know what it's like to live on

6890.48 --> 6897.919999999999
a submarine for 20 years

6893.28 --> 6901.04
and never have it docked to clean it out

6897.92 --> 6901.679
right to go with the hoses through it

6901.04 --> 6906.88
and clean

6901.679 --> 6911.04
all that [ __ ] out all that sweat

6906.88 --> 6914.56
all that human goo

6911.04 --> 6917.28
skin cells it's like dude

6914.56 --> 6919.1990000000005
saying stuck in a in a confined space

6917.28 --> 6920.5599999999995
without the open air going through it

6919.199 --> 6924.32
and everything dude it gets

6920.56 --> 6928.159000000001
dirty now think of that 20 years

6924.32 --> 6930.32
that's it's going to be so

6928.159 --> 6932.638999999999
incredibly dirty in the iss if it's

6930.32 --> 6934.719
really been up there for 20 years

6932.639 --> 6936.88
and i've never seen like oh yeah we need

6934.719 --> 6939.76
to go through it with a cleaning crew

6936.88 --> 6941.92
right now let's get out the special

6939.76 --> 6944.08
vacuum cleaners

6941.92 --> 6946.4800000000005
and let's scrub it now we've never seen

6944.08 --> 6948.719
that before well

6946.48 --> 6949.759999999999
it's going to be dirty as [ __ ] and

6948.719 --> 6952.8
there's going to be like

6949.76 --> 6955.280000000001
dust floating in there

6952.8 --> 6956.8
constantly and that dust is not just

6955.28 --> 6959.92
like

6956.8 --> 6962.2390000000005
plant dust sand no that's literally

6959.92 --> 6965.04
human skin dust

6962.239 --> 6965.919999999999
sorry for the imagery but like the iss

6965.04 --> 6970.4
if they were real

6965.92 --> 6970.4
it would be really disgusting in there

6972.84 --> 6977.84
ah

6975.84 --> 6979.599
right so on that note i'm gonna round

6977.84 --> 6982.159000000001
out the show so you can think about that

6979.599 --> 6982.159000000001
imagery

6982.8 --> 6986.719
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6985.119 --> 6988.96
like this show i thought it was pretty

6986.719 --> 6992.32
cool today

6988.96 --> 6993.599
very active lots of controversy with the

6992.32 --> 6995.119
chat i like that

6993.599 --> 6996.719
i like that as long as it's under

6995.119 --> 7001.36
control

6996.719 --> 7003.92
and i allow for a limited poking around

7001.36 --> 7005.44
if you also like this show then please

7003.92 --> 7008.159
don't forget to robin's it

7005.44 --> 7009.28

7014.4 --> 7017.36
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

7016.639 --> 7019.84
weekend

7017.36 --> 7020.48
and please also do support me guys and

7019.84 --> 7023.04
gals

7020.48 --> 7024.799999999999
through the paypal especially patreon

7023.04 --> 7026.719
also

7024.8 --> 7029.4400000000005
crypto wallets super chat and the

7026.719 --> 7031.36
membership system join button

7029.44 --> 7034.719
and yeah of course thanks everybody that

7031.36 --> 7037.119
has supported me over the years

7034.719 --> 7039.04
and frequently i really appreciate

7037.119 --> 7042.239
you're the guys and girls that are

7039.04 --> 7046.159
are keeping me going it really is

7042.239 --> 7046.879999999999
quite direct so yeah i'm still doing

7046.159 --> 7049.759999999999
great

7046.88 --> 7052.4800000000005
over the overall in the last month but

7049.76 --> 7055.52
it would be great if the support would

7052.48 --> 7058.718999999999
kind of continue because

7055.52 --> 7061.119000000001
otherwise i'll be back square one again

7058.719 --> 7062.639
after some time i don't want to be i've

7061.119 --> 7063.44
been doing great i kind of want to keep

7062.639 --> 7065.599
doing great

7063.44 --> 7066.879999999999
so i'm trying to be very careful with my

7065.599 --> 7070.719
money

7066.88 --> 7073.36
not spend it all at once try to

7070.719 --> 7074.88
remain wise in my investments for as

7073.36 --> 7078.719
much as i can

7074.88 --> 7078.719
please keep supporting me right

7079.28 --> 7083.5199999999995
i thank you those that have like through

7081.599 --> 7086.08
patreon i don't really shout out my

7083.52 --> 7088.0
patreons enough

7086.08 --> 7089.44
there's only two left right now i think

7088.0 --> 7093.199
it's seeking stormwater

7089.44 --> 7093.199
and samson

7094.639 --> 7098.400000000001
so thank you for continuing the support

7096.96 --> 7100.639
there

7098.4 --> 7102.48
donate to the paypal don't forget it the

7100.639 --> 7105.92
link is in the description box below

7102.48 --> 7105.919999999999
it's very easy very direct

7106.48 --> 7110.4
and there's very little like money they

7109.52 --> 7113.280000000001
cut out of it

7110.4 --> 7115.04
so please consider right i will be back

7113.28 --> 7116.719
tomorrow with flat earth early bird

7115.04 --> 7118.719
number 922

7116.719 --> 7120.32
on a saturday so it's going to be 2 p.m

7118.719 --> 7121.76
amsterdam time

7120.32 --> 7124.32
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

7121.76 --> 7126.2390000000005
debates which should start up any second

7124.32 --> 7128.88
now

7126.239 --> 7131.119
so yeah again thanks everyone for coming

7128.88 --> 7143.84
and until the next video

7131.119 --> 7143.839999999999
keep it flat

7144.3 --> 7165.439
[Music]

7178.639 --> 7180.719
you
