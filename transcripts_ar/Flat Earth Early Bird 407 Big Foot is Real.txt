65.039 --> 72.06
little bit late today just insanely late

69.84 --> 78.57000000000001
up yesterday and it's all Karen B's

72.06 --> 87.75
fault and her big foot anyway yeah the

78.57 --> 90.8
weather okay Ben dreary but that's not

87.75 --> 94.05
raining right now it's fine

90.8 --> 98.22
seems that the big mists finally passed

94.05 --> 100.439
over and and I can hear just no more

98.22 --> 103.53
fireworks now at all like usually the

100.439 --> 106.97
first maybe the second day after the new

103.53 --> 110.57900000000001
year that still the kids fooling around

106.97 --> 117.39
lighting fireworks but I haven't heard a

110.579 --> 119.69999999999999
single bang so far anyway hmm yeah I got

117.39 --> 123.63
Tamera coffee with me and some green tea

119.7 --> 128.19
yeah y'all rapidly stomp this out of the

123.63 --> 133.769
ground because I literally woke up 5 to

128.19 --> 139.98
2 apparently needed to sleep a lot cuz

133.769 --> 142.739
yeah yesterday yeah one can be went life

139.98 --> 146.97
I really at that point kind of just

142.739 --> 153.239
planned to go to bed but it was a really

146.97 --> 156.329
really interesting stream and yeah Karen

153.239 --> 159.03
also shared just video details and it

156.329 --> 160.33
was great to get a look at that stuff

159.03 --> 164.91
again

160.33 --> 171.52
and now from a more serious angle and

164.91 --> 175.48
also yeah from ethereal experiences so

171.52 --> 178.84
much basically rolled in back into my

175.48 --> 184.26
memory kind of concerning these these

178.84 --> 184.26
creatures these beings the big feet and

184.53 --> 193.14
how they are so incredibly special as

188.11 --> 199.45000000000002
creatures yeah yeah real absolutely real

193.14 --> 203.01999999999998
so real I could say that they are part

199.45 --> 205.6
of creation they're not even foreign

203.02 --> 209.05
introduced they're literally a species

205.6 --> 211.0
on this planet that yeah that the

209.05 --> 215.86
controllers and the grabbers have tried

211.0 --> 218.77
to erase from human consciousness but

215.86 --> 223.81
they're there they're everywhere like in

218.77 --> 227.26000000000002
every continent and they're not animals

223.81 --> 231.73
they are humans they are humanoid like

227.26 --> 234.82
on our planet born here always been here

231.73 --> 237.48899999999998
always been here just like humans from

234.82 --> 240.82
the start always they were here always

237.489 --> 243.94
and they're on average probably smarter

240.82 --> 247.57
and a lot wiser than human beings they

243.94 --> 251.85999999999999
have very powerful spiritual capacities

247.57 --> 256.359
and so much so that they somehow have

251.86 --> 260.82
these cloaking abilities phasing I call

256.359 --> 264.47999999999996
it where they can just yeah trance it

260.82 --> 267.45
into another level of the Material Plane

264.48 --> 271.11
so they can literally phase out of it

267.45 --> 271.11
it's pretty amazing

272.049 --> 280.06899999999996
and yeah as skerin basically explained

275.959 --> 282.199
to me so much open up and I just started

280.069 --> 283.699
saying this is that that is that this is

282.199 --> 287.86
that that I remember this I remember

283.699 --> 292.159
that yeah and I don't have any physical

287.86 --> 295.399
relatable experience to relay to but I

292.159 --> 299.389
know that on the other side didn't much

295.399 --> 301.129
of my spirit travel my dark world

299.389 --> 304.159
experience that jaian jaian

301.129 --> 308.119
a deal a year-long experience that is

304.159 --> 311.68899999999996
sometimes point back at that inside of

308.119 --> 316.189
these beings and meeting them and even

311.689 --> 320.089
like being being alongside them in their

316.189 --> 323.149
spiritual realm as spirit not physically

320.089 --> 325.759
it was physically there ever but that

323.149 --> 326.899
you can even ask spirit form communicate

325.759 --> 330.199
with them because they are that

326.899 --> 333.409
enlightening and I experienced that and

330.199 --> 338.749
it's just like oh yeah yeah damn right

333.409 --> 343.18899999999996
and in a way that the funny thing is is

338.749 --> 346.459
that they are very special beings but

343.189 --> 348.97900000000004
overall they're not even super exciting

346.459 --> 351.229
you know humans are much more

348.979 --> 353.56899999999996
interesting in a way because humans are

351.229 --> 356.989
so freaking crazy humans can think of

353.569 --> 363.409
the weirdest freakiest things humans

356.989 --> 368.32899999999995
have more complications because I think

363.409 --> 370.759
that the big foot race that they are

368.329 --> 373.189
actually kind of boring and basic in a

370.759 --> 375.86
way but that's good because they don't

373.189 --> 378.97900000000004
allow themselves to get distracted by

375.86 --> 381.589
nonsense and demonic things they stay

378.979 --> 386.469
very basic and that's also a source of

381.589 --> 386.469
their logos their spiritual power

386.94 --> 398.21999999999997
but they are not dumb yeah and they're

394.83 --> 401.90999999999997
invisible if they want to be they're not

398.22 --> 407.28000000000003
literally invisible but they simply are

401.91 --> 410.16
phased out and that looks kind of low to

407.28 --> 412.83
humans like they're being like they're

410.16 --> 415.98
cloaked like the predator from the the

412.83 --> 418.5
predator movie looks a bit like that and

415.98 --> 425.58000000000004
there it was even caught on footage it

418.5 --> 427.83
was very remarkable right well you can't

425.58 --> 431.21999999999997
catch them because they can feel your

427.83 --> 434.37
intentions thoughts and all of that for

431.22 --> 437.76000000000005
miles away so yeah no [ __ ] you can't

434.37 --> 439.5
catch him cause any time anyone plans to

437.76 --> 440.82
do anything with them they'll feel it

439.5 --> 443.94
coming and they'll get out of there

440.82 --> 448.05
because they don't like to be confronted

443.94 --> 449.94
with the budget oh you know oh I'm gonna

448.05 --> 451.77000000000004
I'm gonna conquer the other species I'm

449.94 --> 459.42
gonna destroy all the monsters yeah they

451.77 --> 462.419
feel that coming a long way no no it's

459.42 --> 465.15000000000003
not in the imagination Tom Parker yeah

462.419 --> 467.03
it's there is there did you see did you

465.15 --> 470.92999999999995
see the stream that you see the footage

467.03 --> 470.92999999999995
yeah it's there

473.19 --> 477.269
[Music]

479.95 --> 487.99
it's funny that you mention it now AGM

482.87 --> 487.99
because yeah I freaking dreamed about it

489.58 --> 500.3
yeah because I got called by them

496.22 --> 502.79
through Karen that's also part white

500.3 --> 505.25
just kept up so credible and then I

502.79 --> 510.52000000000004
thought [ __ ] I have to take a huge

505.25 --> 513.41
amount of fish oil and I did that

510.52 --> 518.81
yesterday night or rather in the morning

513.41 --> 521.86
yeah and yeah I did dream yeah I was

518.81 --> 521.8599999999999
there again

523.72 --> 531.64
yeah well a GMA if if your subconscious

528.41 --> 534.62
wants you to project yourself over that

531.64 --> 536.81
cartoonish Superman figure made by

534.62 --> 541.34
Luciferians hey that's your prerogative

536.81 --> 545.3599999999999
I have real spiritual things contact and

541.34 --> 548.96
that's not just oh my imagination is

545.36 --> 550.97
trying to make of it with the things

548.96 --> 552.77
that the blahblahblah psychology

550.97 --> 555.98
oversimplification over general relation

552.77 --> 558.74
no no it's no that's spiritual I know

555.98 --> 563.09
when something is a constructed mind

558.74 --> 564.5
dream puzzling like Legos with with

563.09 --> 568.15
things that happened and when it's

564.5 --> 571.94
actually a spiritual experience so yeah

568.15 --> 574.37
it's so funny it's so funny it's so fun

571.94 --> 576.8000000000001
is it band time again is everybody

574.37 --> 578.69
literally gonna be laughing about this

576.8 --> 580.9399999999999
like all the people that have all

578.69 --> 582.44
cultivate here are they all gonna be all

580.94 --> 584.9000000000001
shitty giggling and laughing because

582.44 --> 590.1800000000001
that means I'm gonna ban a whole lot of

584.9 --> 594.29
people yeah because this is not funny

590.18 --> 599.0899999999999
big the only reason anyone anyone ever

594.29 --> 603.4699999999999
ever on the internet ever ever thinks

599.09 --> 606.8000000000001
bigfoot is funny is because the inserted

603.47 --> 607.4300000000001
ridicule that has been going on for at

606.8 --> 611.779
least

607.43 --> 615.8299999999999
forty years my entire life Bigfoot was

611.779 --> 618.2
so ridiculed from where everyone at

615.83 --> 619.46
anything except well my mother didn't

618.2 --> 621.4100000000001
think it was ridiculous

619.46 --> 626.529
she had spirits experience spiritual

621.41 --> 628.9699999999999
experiences with them as well but

626.529 --> 632.3
everyone thinks it's absolutely

628.97 --> 636.83
ridiculous and why well not just because

632.3 --> 639.4399999999999
a giant hairy creature no because of the

636.83 --> 642.47
spiritual implications because of their

639.44 --> 644.839
elusiveness because it is spiritual and

642.47 --> 648.26
anything that is genuinely spiritual

644.839 --> 653.9300000000001
anchored in actual living persisting

648.26 --> 657.05
creatures is just a giant screaming pain

653.93 --> 659.5999999999999
to all these demonic atheists out there

657.05 --> 664.13
that want everything in the world all to

659.6 --> 668.36
be dead inside and basic and stupid and

664.13 --> 673.12
robotic like them because that's the

668.36 --> 677.72
baseline culture so Bigfoot is a giant

673.12 --> 684.1
stain or rather the opposite it's it's a

677.72 --> 684.1
giant light just ruining the shadowplay

684.85 --> 694.3000000000001
everything about it being in contact

690.529 --> 698.57
with them what they are how they act how

694.3 --> 702.5889999999999
they can't be caught all of that just

698.57 --> 706.25
hits the ego of giant swathes of people

702.589 --> 709.4000000000001
so bad that it's almost to the same

706.25 --> 711.77
level as Flat Earth it's it's that bad a

709.4 --> 716.6899999999999
response nowadays and it's been rammed

711.77 --> 718.52
in there you know what happens when you

716.69 --> 721.5200000000001
started to say talk well yeah I believe

718.52 --> 724.16
Bigfoot I totally get Karen be now with

721.52 --> 727.64
this it's weird because for some reason

724.16 --> 729.9499999999999
I've kind of stayed away or rather kept

727.64 --> 733.279
my distance it's like I wasn't ready for

729.95 --> 735.8900000000001
this [ __ ] yet maybe I had to wait until

733.279 --> 738.97
my seven chakra was open in order for me

735.89 --> 738.97
to even start engaging

739.519 --> 746.269
I love these psychotic

743.029 --> 746.959

861.51 --> 868.83
disappointed and all of you giving this

865.17 --> 871.56

868.83 --> 875.13
daily show for years I put this on the

871.56 --> 883.6099999999999
table and you respond like this I find

875.13 --> 883.61
it pretty repulsive yeah

884.24 --> 890.0790000000001
in the woods Matt Harry in the woods

humans and their need that yeah bend and

900.829 --> 907.3599999999999
twist everything in nature to their own

903.079 --> 907.3599999999999

1043.39 --> 1050.929
Bigfoot is not funny hahaha

1048.199 --> 1052.63
that giant hairy oh look at all the

1050.929 --> 1055.76
silly people yeah that's all

1052.63 --> 1058.73
artificially created and shoved down

Loch Ness monster it so rammed in there

that ridicule it has to be stupid ten

1069.289 --> 1074.09
years during the 90s ten years they

1071.39 --> 1077.419
rammed it down there

1074.09 --> 1080.36
Bigfoot is dumped Bigfoot is dumb

Bigfoot is dumb yeah

and it's all coming out it's bleeding

1083.0 --> 1092.299
out of your soul right now

1084.76 --> 1095.33
just because I bring it up yeah what's

1092.299 --> 1099.47
happening mark color Bigfoot is what

1095.33 --> 1101.809
happening I put Bigfoot on the table

1099.47 --> 1105.19
that's what's happening and now I'm

1101.809 --> 1109.1589999999999
showing people what that does to them

1105.19 --> 1113.3600000000001
because the the the amount of ridicule

1109.159 --> 1118.419
and shaming that is associated with this

1113.36 --> 1122.4189999999999
phenomena with these creatures so bad so

1118.419 --> 1125.3300000000002
incredibly bad that in its own way it's

1122.419 --> 1131.23
almost as bad as flat earth the allergic

1125.33 --> 1131.23
or response to Flat Earth it's that bad

1133.65 --> 1139.25

1159.47 --> 1166.64
that footage well guess what it could

1163.04 --> 1169.43
simply be real yeah

1166.64 --> 1172.13
odd isn't it yeah it just looks like a

1169.43 --> 1175.49
humanoid that's hairy or has a suit on

1172.13 --> 1177.5600000000002
how old yeah well that's because that's

1175.49 --> 1185.93
probably what they are like and they are

1177.56 --> 1187.31
visible sometimes yeah yeah Karen be

1185.93 --> 1191.18
it's all your fault

1187.31 --> 1193.3999999999999
this is all your fault you you kept me

1244.46 --> 1248.6000000000001
breather just step outside away from

your mobile or your computer just take a

1248.6 --> 1263.4699999999998
breather buddy yeah Karen be well it's

1259.55 --> 1266.26
to me it's way way beyond fascinating

1263.47 --> 1269.24
it's not just fascinating it is

1266.26 --> 1272.74
extremely revealing because of the

1269.24 --> 1276.86
context of what they are how they are

1272.74 --> 1281.57
where they have been among us with us

1276.86 --> 1293.27
for I've forever since the start the

1281.57 --> 1296.45
pace of get out just look at that

1293.27 --> 1299.93
freaking face of your icon just look at

1296.45 --> 1303.56
them it's just what where do these

1299.93 --> 1306.13
people come up with this [ __ ] [ __ ]

1303.56 --> 1309.3799999999999
of making sock accounts or whatever

1306.13 --> 1312.0200000000002
giving them like the dumbest freaking

1309.38 --> 1315.0400000000002
faces you can imagine it's not even my

1312.02 --> 1318.02
faith now just some random dude warp it

1315.04 --> 1321.2
give themselves a name that literally

1318.02 --> 1324.68
says I'm a freaking [ __ ] or I'm an

1321.2 --> 1327.1100000000001
idiot like not towards the reader no

1324.68 --> 1330.14
towards themselves and then they go

1327.11 --> 1336.1299999999999
troll people with that telling them you

1330.14 --> 1339.5
are done how insane is that these people

1336.13 --> 1342.71
they're just literally spiraling out of

1339.5 --> 1347.32
control insane and it's like Society

1342.71 --> 1351.5900000000001
allows it just the insanity is like

1347.32 --> 1354.01
acceptable apparently in some way so

1351.59 --> 1354.01
weird

1354.04 --> 1363.68
no George Sandford they are not monsters

1359.14 --> 1366.26
they are humanoids and they are probably

1363.68 --> 1369.22
on average less monstrous than humans

1366.26 --> 1369.22
are yeah

1370.78 --> 1377.33
because hey if you have any account

1374.57 --> 1381.4399999999998
historically in in what way whatsoever

1377.33 --> 1385.34
that humans got physically hurt or

1381.44 --> 1388.94
injured or killed in some kind of

1385.34 --> 1390.74
encounter with a Bigfoot well good luck

1388.94 --> 1393.52
with that doesn't exist because it never

1390.74 --> 1393.52
happens ever

1398.89 --> 1410.38
yeah Fyodor Dostoevsky I kind of

1401.3 --> 1410.3799999999999
disagree not really

1418.84 --> 1425.97
all right George Sanford yeah they are

1433.95 --> 1443.44
hahahahaha so funny so funny look I

1438.309 --> 1446.289
found a smiley icon oh so creative look

1443.44 --> 1448.02
I am a troll I can make more suck

1446.289 --> 1450.69
accounts I can make more very

1448.02 --> 1454.75
superficial non well-thought-through

1450.69 --> 1457.809
statements to try and make my target

1454.75 --> 1460.99
look stupid but I will never succeed

1457.809 --> 1463.779
because my vocal range is very limited

1460.99 --> 1466.72
and I don't have anything really to

1463.779 --> 1470.649
insult him with so I'm just going to say

1466.72 --> 1474.1200000000001
something really dumb a really short way

1470.649 --> 1474.12
before I get banned

1487.16 --> 1490.209
[Music]

1492.95 --> 1505.14
yeah well flatter spaceman

1495.48 --> 1508.44
look at this point it's like I I trust I

1505.14 --> 1510.63
trust Karen B I've trust what she showed

1508.44 --> 1514.7
me I trust her feelings because I know

1510.63 --> 1517.71
Karen B is a very spiritually developed

1514.7 --> 1522.21
open person and I can literally feel

1517.71 --> 1525.9
that from her even at a distance met her

1522.21 --> 1529.1000000000001
during the Amsterdam conference and she

1525.9 --> 1532.5600000000002
knows that we can have like unspoken

1529.1 --> 1537.6899999999998
conversations based on just spiritual

1532.56 --> 1540.09
understanding so yeah I believe they're

1537.69 --> 1542.4
there I pretty much know it at this

1540.09 --> 1548.82
point if it's so many in direct contact

1542.4 --> 1551.73
that I'd love to meet them one day maybe

1548.82 --> 1557.58
even try the phasing thing because who

1551.73 --> 1561.6
knows maybe I could handle it that would

1557.58 --> 1563.46
be amazing to actually if you have some

1561.6 --> 1565.9199999999998
kind of physical experience of what it

1563.46 --> 1569.28
would be like to be phased out of the

1565.92 --> 1573.0600000000002
regular physical realm that would be

1569.28 --> 1575.76
amazing but as for other people yeah

1573.06 --> 1577.5
well hey if you don't believe in Bigfoot

1575.76 --> 1583.29
you really think that that's a waste of

1577.5 --> 1586.62
time good stay away it's very simple

1583.29 --> 1590.8799999999999
stay away don't get involved leave it

1586.62 --> 1593.1599999999999
alone leave Bigfoot alone that's

1590.88 --> 1595.2900000000002
probably the most important message is

1593.16 --> 1600.48
just leave these guys alone and guys and

1595.29 --> 1603.09
girls and hey if you have an inner

1600.48 --> 1604.98
feeling like ooh I know there's

1603.09 --> 1609.33
something spiritual I mean I wanna

1604.98 --> 1611.67
contact then then you go then you go for

1609.33 --> 1613.5
it if you feel it's like all the waste

1611.67 --> 1615.66
the time it's just a bunch of ridiculous

1613.5 --> 1618.69
creatures nobody really cares about or

1615.66 --> 1621.1100000000001
whatever then stay away from them leave

1618.69 --> 1621.1100000000001

1647.7 --> 1656.559
this Essene air goes with the fantasy

1651.49 --> 1660.7
fantasy its graylien so I just already

1656.559 --> 1664.059
said look big feet are extremely

1660.7 --> 1667.57
peaceful they have never been on record

1664.059 --> 1668.77
hurting anyone ever maybe startle people

1667.57 --> 1672.55
that's it

1668.77 --> 1676.03
and this troll of course had to insert

1672.55 --> 1678.19
Oh the opiate hurts you because yeah

1676.03 --> 1681.4289999999999
that's the only thing they want they

1678.19 --> 1683.26
want everyone to start killing each

1681.429 --> 1685.69
other like a bunch of demons that's what

1683.26 --> 1688.03
these trolls in their minds do in their

1685.69 --> 1691.3600000000001
minds in their fantasy all they see all

1688.03 --> 1694.29
day is just people and creatures killing

1691.36 --> 1698.1399999999999
each other because they're psychotic

1694.29 --> 1701.559
psychopathic little demon goblins all of

1698.14 --> 1704.0500000000002
them and they're very act at just

1701.559 --> 1708.79
respawning accounts and then asserting

1704.05 --> 1711.6399999999999
their vile demonic violence from within

1708.79 --> 1713.86
and project that over the world try to

1711.64 --> 1716.71
make it rub off well no it's not gonna

1713.86 --> 1718.8799999999999
rub off it's just gonna be repulsive and

get you banned

1731.58 --> 1739.12

1736.39 --> 1744.3600000000001
you feel it or not and that sure is you

1739.12 --> 1744.36
I heard flies I try not to hurt them I

1745.02 --> 1751.36
don't like them being around they piss

1748.179 --> 1754.89
me off but I don't kill him I just try

1751.36 --> 1758.02
to get them out of the way use their

1754.89 --> 1759.66
basicness to contain them and then get

1758.02 --> 1763.619
them out

1776.19 --> 1784.8600000000001
yes us yes oh good the cloaking device

1781.86 --> 1787.6699999999998
is a more generalized term it's like ooh

1784.86 --> 1791.1299999999999
D Klingons from Star Trek are cloaked

1787.67 --> 1795.18
predator from the predator movie it

1791.13 --> 1797.73
cloaks that I call it phasing though

1795.18 --> 1802.41
because it's not just some kind of light

1797.73 --> 1806.58
screen thing it's like the matter itself

1802.41 --> 1809.13
is somehow changed it it's a frequency

1806.58 --> 1811.02
change and it's therefore I'd rather

1809.13 --> 1814.73
call it phasing because it's like a

1811.02 --> 1817.68
frequency phasing thing and it causes

1814.73 --> 1822.51
them to literally phase out of the

1817.68 --> 1826.5800000000002
normal physical reality enter like a sub

1822.51 --> 1826.58
dimension through

1829.76 --> 1832.789
[Music]

1840.26 --> 1845.27
yeah and if anybody else thinks it's

1842.6 --> 1848.809
funny to make a joke like that I don't

1845.27 --> 1850.549
care if you've been here every day every

1848.809 --> 1852.6789999999999
day for a year and actually been polite

1850.549 --> 1856.36
you'll be banned if you anyone makes a

1852.679 --> 1871.13
remark like that don't don't get

1856.36 --> 1872.4499999999998
disgusting for any reason yeah house I

1871.13 --> 1875.3300000000002
know I know

1872.45 --> 1877.64
hey Hoss there's another little factoid

1875.33 --> 1881.6
about predator right you might be

1877.64 --> 1885.3700000000001
overlooking it's fiction it's not real

1881.6 --> 1888.559
that whole thing was made up see it's

1885.37 --> 1892.7299999999998
fake future technology with a fake

1888.559 --> 1895.61
creature from a fake other planet put

1892.73 --> 1897.38
into that setting and there's no doubt

1895.61 --> 1899.9599999999998
in my mind whatsoever that the whole

1897.38 --> 1902.63
cloaking thing and the entire setup and

1899.96 --> 1905.72
the feel of it was very likely inspired

1902.63 --> 1908.3300000000002
on Bigfoot encounters because hey these

1905.72 --> 1911.799
creatures have been around since the

1908.33 --> 1914.57
beginning of time so you think that

1911.799 --> 1916.91
nobody's ever heard of that nobody knew

1914.57 --> 1920.48
that they were around of course and yes

1916.91 --> 1923.39
of course everyone all the the Jesuits

1920.48 --> 1926.99
all the controllers yes of course they

1923.39 --> 1931.99
know they're there from the start of

1926.99 --> 1934.4
course they do don't be a fool

1931.99 --> 1936.79
it's never been a surprise they were

1934.4 --> 1936.7900000000002
there

1941.92 --> 1949.52
why anders ace because i don't like

1946.61 --> 1954.28
people making disgusting jokes that are

1949.52 --> 1954.28
not funny that's why

1957.64 --> 1960.779
[Music]

1965.08 --> 1972.77
yeah creation it's called creation where

1968.57 --> 1975.8899999999999
all the living beings that we know and

1972.77 --> 1979.49
probably more were designed by the

1975.89 --> 1982.43
Creator manifest physically in the

1979.49 --> 1985.58
physical realm yeah that time the

1982.43 --> 1989.3600000000001
creation the beginning and I'll bet you

1985.58 --> 2003.6399999999999
that that Bigfoot and their kind were

1989.36 --> 2007.75
there as well absolutely all right

2003.64 --> 2009.64
Oh Karen B I'm still not entirely

2007.75 --> 2012.61
convinced about that though because I do

2009.64 --> 2015.73
think that maybe they can use kind of

2012.61 --> 2018.04
basic physical tools would be so easy so

2015.73 --> 2020.38
convenient to do that but because of

2018.04 --> 2022.72
their spiritual abilities and their well

2020.38 --> 2024.94
their affective cloak yeah there's very

2022.72 --> 2030.7
little that they need they could

2024.94 --> 2033.06
probably improvise a lot with their with

2030.7 --> 2036.49
their polarization feel and all that and

2033.06 --> 2040.87
do a lot of things that humans require

2036.49 --> 2042.85
tools for but I mean I'm not satisfied

2040.87 --> 2047.1699999999998
that they they use no tools whatsoever

2042.85 --> 2052.12
you know there's great advantage in just

2047.17 --> 2055.7200000000003
using I don't know basic knife for

2052.12 --> 2060.64
example for just for making other things

2055.72 --> 2065.41
or you know not hurting your nails it's

2060.64 --> 2068.31
just so easy to use basic tools I don't

2065.41 --> 2068.31
see why they wouldn't

2072.34 --> 2076.3500000000004
but then again yeah I don't know

2090.38 --> 2093.59
[Music]

2094.03 --> 2101.2400000000002
yeah I'm gonna pile this on I'm just

2098.21 --> 2110.06
gonna go full full double down and call

2101.24 --> 2112.58
this episode Big Foot is real yeah like

2110.06 --> 2115.19
who gives a [ __ ] anyway at this point if

2112.58 --> 2119.95
I could go into Oh God Arvind said it

2115.19 --> 2123.56
Arwen said something that might somehow

2119.95 --> 2128.21
give the feel to the general public that

2123.56 --> 2132.29
he may be not legitimate okay if anybody

2128.21 --> 2136.2200000000003
even has that kind of trigger level

2132.29 --> 2139.3
towards me of any kind then yeah they'll

2136.22 --> 2144.5299999999997
probably have a very malformed view on

2139.3 --> 2146.9500000000003
Who I am or what I do anyway so doesn't

2144.53 --> 2146.9500000000003
really matter

2154.91 --> 2163.549
yeah Karen B Oh I'd like to join you I'd

2158.869 --> 2167.7400000000002
like to join you and take up arms to mow

2163.549 --> 2171.68
all this gamma pollution out of the way

2167.74 --> 2173.6299999999997
because it's everywhere this kind of

2171.68 --> 2175.5989999999997
[ __ ] this type of response it's

2173.63 --> 2179.809
everywhere

2175.599 --> 2183.98
poison force fetid the general public

2179.809 --> 2188.6600000000003
everyone of all levels and we don't even

2183.98 --> 2191.21
know how much has actually been poisoned

2188.66 --> 2194.1189999999997
we are not even fully aware yet of how

2191.21 --> 2198.7400000000002
much poison has been fed to us it's just

2194.119 --> 2202.549
very easy to figure out that big food is

2198.74 --> 2206.18
one of those things as is one of those

2202.549 --> 2215.66
forced fed poisons to make us ridicule

2206.18 --> 2218.029
it and stay away from it yeah you would

2215.66 --> 2220.009
assume yeah lovely isn't it zapped happy

2218.029 --> 2220.43
we would assume we wouldn't sit well

2220.009 --> 2225.7400000000002
really

2220.43 --> 2228.049
so why where is it why why would you

2225.74 --> 2228.319
assume that they wouldn't take care of

2228.049 --> 2232.13
it

2228.319 --> 2236.119
you know who knows how far that stuff

2232.13 --> 2240.619
goes you know it could be that kind of

2236.119 --> 2242.69
like the old the old pale people that

2240.619 --> 2245.9900000000002
were probably also around next to big

2242.69 --> 2247.5190000000002
feet these weird pictures of them Martin

2245.99 --> 2249.0789999999997
Lucas showed them I think there's

2247.519 --> 2253.16
something to it it's like this weird

2249.079 --> 2258.4100000000003
pale people they were known to eat their

2253.16 --> 2262.64
dead right well who's to say that big

2258.41 --> 2265.609
feet don't do that to and oh my god it's

2262.64 --> 2267.43
so terrible well maybe they do that

2265.609 --> 2269.9
maybe they do it for a reason

2267.43 --> 2274.759
technically who gives a [ __ ] at this

2269.9 --> 2277.819
point but that could be a good reason

2274.759 --> 2281.0
why do we don't find any corpses or

2277.819 --> 2284.0589999999997
skeletons and who knows how freaking all

2281.0 --> 2286.46
these creatures really do yet it who

2284.059 --> 2288.8390000000004
says that they have lifespans that are

2286.46 --> 2293.279
equal to humans maybe they'll grow

2288.839 --> 2295.92
like twice or three times as old you

2293.279 --> 2298.529
know Karen already said in our

2295.92 --> 2302.369
experience that it seems like it's more

2298.529 --> 2304.739
the young ones that go and fool around

2302.369 --> 2307.17
with humans that dare to get close like

2304.739 --> 2309.719
a bunch of teenagers just screwing

2307.17 --> 2312.4500000000003
around in a way even though they you

2309.719 --> 2315.779
already are kind of big so who know who

2312.45 --> 2318.859
knows how old they really get they could

2315.779 --> 2321.15
potentially get like 200 years old or

2318.859 --> 2325.2889999999998
300 who knows

2321.15 --> 2327.6600000000003
and if creatures grow that old then to

2325.289 --> 2332.6090000000004
assume that you just be finding that

2327.66 --> 2342.1189999999997
body remnants everywhere I don't see it

2332.609 --> 2344.13
I don't see the necessity yeah yeah the

2342.119 --> 2350.63
next time you say something like that

2344.13 --> 2350.63
big chunk is your band it's not funny

2351.95 --> 2357.2889999999998
don't appreciate that type of input

2363.37 --> 2373.93
oh yeah yeah that's also a good point

2370.75 --> 2378.28
although I look flatlander I kind of

2373.93 --> 2380.8599999999997
doubt they'd just leave their corpses up

2378.28 --> 2393.3100000000004
for wild animals to take care of it

2380.86 --> 2396.88
I doubt it so yeah well September for a

2393.31 --> 2399.7599999999998
long time but the same time yeah oh we

2396.88 --> 2403.3900000000003
do human do humans do find a lot of

2399.76 --> 2403.78
stuff like giant skeletons hoards of

2403.39 --> 2405.1299999999997
them

2403.78 --> 2407.0800000000004
guess what happens with those they don't

2405.13 --> 2411.79
get reported they can shovel in the

2407.08 --> 2415.36
ocean well who's to say the Smithsonian

2411.79 --> 2416.62
has not run into like these Bigfoot

2415.36 --> 2420.36
burial places

2416.62 --> 2424.21
who's to say why do you constantly

2420.36 --> 2426.19
assume like the ones in control of the

2424.21 --> 2428.23
information that gave you the false

2426.19 --> 2430.87
picture of what the world is like is

2428.23 --> 2433.75
just gonna reveal to you real

2430.87 --> 2438.7599999999998
information when they come across it why

2433.75 --> 2441.22
do you assume this look these people in

2438.76 --> 2445.6000000000004
control of this stuff tell you freaking

2441.22 --> 2447.9599999999996
dinosaurs existed the t-rex existed you

2445.6 --> 2450.96
think they're gonna tell you real things

2447.96 --> 2450.96
really

2463.03 --> 2469.0600000000004
they're not and they never will they

2466.93 --> 2471.3999999999996
will they have always been there and

2469.06 --> 2474.2999999999997
they always will be there to give you a

2471.4 --> 2477.61
false historical narrative picture and

2474.3 --> 2480.36
to mechanize improvised things together

2477.61 --> 2484.81
in order to reinforce that belief and

2480.36 --> 2487.06
shove anything truly truthful aside

2484.81 --> 2489.37
shove it away shove it in the ocean

2487.06 --> 2492.52
shove it down the memory hole make sure

2489.37 --> 2494.8599999999997
that nobody cares about that and that

2492.52 --> 2497.65
everybody keeps on fast being fascinated

2494.86 --> 2501.46
and bound with the machination story

2497.65 --> 2506.8
that they built the mystery of evolution

2501.46 --> 2511.4990000000003
and that that's their job

2506.8 --> 2511.4990000000003
[Music]

2519.8 --> 2528.1400000000003
yeah tiny wubble yeah the tiny grainy

2523.64 --> 2530.0
footage yeah could be real I don't

2528.14 --> 2537.71
really care at this point it could be

2530.0 --> 2540.83
real I think it probably is I personally

2537.71 --> 2543.17
have no way to verify it other than from

2540.83 --> 2547.52
the sensory input that I get from it

2543.17 --> 2552.58
like what it feels like seeing this

2547.52 --> 2555.59
creature how it moves what is that and

2552.58 --> 2557.47
compare that with other similar types of

2555.59 --> 2560.9900000000002
sightings and Caribee showed a lot of

2557.47 --> 2565.25
video footages with sightings of these

2560.99 --> 2569.68
apparent creatures more much more modern

2565.25 --> 2575.15
footage and it does really seem like

2569.68 --> 2577.8799999999997
just weird very hairy different hair

2575.15 --> 2581.09
colored humanoids and they're like their

2577.88 --> 2585.4100000000003
whole statute is very human it's very

2581.09 --> 2592.4300000000003
like humans compose themselves and I

2585.41 --> 2594.5
think it is real yeah flattered spaceman

2592.43 --> 2596.1499999999996
I wonder what their take on creationists

2594.5 --> 2600.86
as well they'll probably have very

2596.15 --> 2604.96
long-standing verbal or some gavel what

2600.86 --> 2607.4900000000002
to say psionic traditions their own old

2604.96 --> 2612.4
story of the beginning or whatever I'm

2607.49 --> 2618.52
very curious they might have ancient

2612.4 --> 2618.52
stories be amazing to hear them

2636.76 --> 2643.6000000000004
no no reckoner Stefan hey listen Bigfoot

2639.88 --> 2647.34
is not a man-made creature absolutely

2643.6 --> 2647.3399999999997
not what an arrogant assumption

2687.069 --> 2694.359
bear meat why would anyone want to eat

2691.7 --> 2694.359
bear meat

2694.81 --> 2697.98
[Music]

2700.94 --> 2705.349
why the hell would I want to bring that

2703.13 --> 2711.349
up during the flattery debates as a

2705.349 --> 2714.2000000000003
point of that hey Jim no Ragnar Stefan

2711.349 --> 2716.6600000000003
Harrison one more stupid question in

2714.2 --> 2721.609
that direction and I'm timing you out

2716.66 --> 2725.569
now Bigfoot is a created original

2721.609 --> 2728.0
creature alongside human beings at the

2725.569 --> 2731.779
beginning of time the beginning of

2728.0 --> 2734.18
creation the creation of this realm and

2731.779 --> 2740.63
the life within they were there just

2734.18 --> 2743.2889999999998
like humans alongside humans yeah pretty

2740.63 --> 2743.289
convinced of that

2758.869 --> 2764.9
yeah Missouri bear I'm sure what day

2761.819 --> 2767.46
they were should have been but hey look

2764.9 --> 2770.339
if they have these incredible

2767.46 --> 2773.88
capabilities of basically phasing out a

2770.339 --> 2777.18
normal physical reality then I wouldn't

2773.88 --> 2784.17
know why they wouldn't have some kind of

2777.18 --> 2787.23
advantage surviving the flood also yeah

2784.17 --> 2790.079
look I've thought about it it could very

2787.23 --> 2792.569
well be that depending on the nature

2790.079 --> 2795.329
even of the other realm of where they

2792.569 --> 2797.599
phase into what that realm is like they

2795.329 --> 2800.19
could potentially collectively make

2797.599 --> 2803.1800000000003
controlled pocket dimensions where they

2800.19 --> 2808.109
literally collectively come together and

2803.18 --> 2811.19
create a micro realm in between the

2808.109 --> 2817.43
regular realm that they could keep

2811.19 --> 2822.54
exactly as is for a very long period and

2817.43 --> 2827.27
completely avoid interacting with the

2822.54 --> 2827.27
regular physical realm

2838.829 --> 2848.38
how do you know that whiz laws really do

2845.559 --> 2850.8590000000004
this do big feet seem like engineers do

2848.38 --> 2856.75
they really what the proof of that I

2850.859 --> 2860.109
don't think so I think they could

2856.75 --> 2862.39
probably util be utilized if they're if

2860.109 --> 2865.42
they saw the necessity of it they could

2862.39 --> 2869.2
probably out step their normal activity

2865.42 --> 2871.66
their normal peaceful reclusive activity

2869.2 --> 2874.18
to do something and well if they thought

2871.66 --> 2877.5989999999997
it was extremely important for the world

2874.18 --> 2879.8489999999997
or whatever they could probably do

2877.599 --> 2883.9900000000002
something but they're not engineers

2879.849 --> 2886.6800000000003
it's ridiculous no no they're nothing

2883.99 --> 2886.68
like that at all

2890.06 --> 2893.15
[Music]

2894.21 --> 2898.619
get out

2895.74 --> 2908.109
[Music]

2898.619 --> 2912.04
that's not funny either that's not funny

2908.109 --> 2912.46
either AGM one more stupid question like

2912.04 --> 2915.329
that

2912.46 --> 2915.329
and your band

2928.31 --> 2938.63
I already told you already told you it's

2936.05 --> 2945.5
a creature it was there from the

2938.63 --> 2949.31
beginning of creation I have no idea

2945.5 --> 2952.42
what that is has no idea but it sounds

2949.31 --> 2952.42
like it's a fabrication

2962.66 --> 2970.0989999999997
yeah don't get over an enthusiastic Tom

2966.0 --> 2970.099
Parker I'm not done with you yet either

2973.22 --> 2977.7
Najeeb em has been around for a lot

2975.96 --> 2984.9900000000002
longer than you have so don't get all

2977.7 --> 2988.6499999999996
cocky that's right we're gonna Stefan

2984.99 --> 2991.4599999999996
audition not an animal they are as good

2988.65 --> 2994.23
as humans they're probably on average

2991.46 --> 2996.42
smarter than humans that's right they're

2994.23 --> 2998.43
not beasts they're not animal they're

2996.42 --> 3001.4
not monsters than our demons though

2998.43 --> 3006.94
they're humanoids human-like and they're

3001.4 --> 3006.94
probably smarter than humans yeah

3010.6 --> 3013.7599999999998
[Music]

3022.86 --> 3028.9100000000003
no it's not in there not that I know of

3025.68 --> 3032.7
but look if you're good

3028.91 --> 3035.25
what kind of really if it's not in the

3032.7 --> 3037.5899999999997
Bible it can't exist you think that

3035.25 --> 3038.28
everything that's ever existed is in the

3037.59 --> 3043.17
Bible

3038.28 --> 3046.0800000000004
Ragnar Stefan Alison really everything

3043.17 --> 3048.54
so if it's not in the Bible then it can

3046.08 --> 3052.35
exist you don't think that maybe the

3048.54 --> 3054.69
Jesuits kind of left out huge amount of

3052.35 --> 3057.72
things that they don't want into the

3054.69 --> 3060.38
public consciousness at all think that

3057.72 --> 3060.3799999999997
could be the case

3066.08 --> 3069.19
[Music]

3073.27 --> 3076.46
[Music]

3079.48 --> 3085.93
yeah I don't think you'd need to go fair

3082.84 --> 3087.88
Bigfoot IQ tests why didn't you just

3085.93 --> 3089.7999999999997
look at the average IQ test of the

3087.88 --> 3103.78
humans themselves and you already got a

3089.8 --> 3108.1600000000003
problem there is 106 yeah yeah there

3103.78 --> 3112.0
will no more blasphemy from you yeah oh

3108.16 --> 3116.2799999999997
he loves it because he is a christ

3112.0 --> 3119.85
allergy Bible basher he hates hates

3116.28 --> 3125.26
Christ Ragnar Steffen Alderson is an

3119.85 --> 3128.77
anti-christian he is sick of it I'm sick

3125.26 --> 3131.5
of his disgusting little demon jabs his

3128.77 --> 3133.5099999999998
jabs cuz all the thing everything he

3131.5 --> 3137.56
wanted to do he wanted to use Bigfoot he

3133.51 --> 3141.34
wanted to use this entire context just

3137.56 --> 3144.19
to say the Bible is a lie that's all he

3141.34 --> 3146.4100000000003
really wanted because hey if Bigfoot is

3144.19 --> 3148.7200000000003
not in the Bible it's incomplete

3146.41 --> 3154.45
oh it's a lie oh oh you can have your

3148.72 --> 3156.7599999999998

[Music]

3205.369 --> 3212.4790000000003

3212.479 --> 3225.9399999999996

3214.759 --> 3229.359

3288.1 --> 3295.81
I don't think Neanderthals are real I

3290.65 --> 3297.04
think it's a fictional creation I think

3295.81 --> 3300.6
it's total nonsense

3297.04 --> 3300.6
there's no Neanderthals

3322.369 --> 3328.63
so I'll bet they do dance in the woods

3324.559 --> 3328.63
flatlander of course why wouldn't they

3348.579 --> 3354.219
yeah and by the way Tom Parker Bening

3351.67 --> 3357.13
people absolutely does not hurt my

3354.219 --> 3361.449
pocket because I ban people that are not

3357.13 --> 3364.599
supporters yet they come by how is that

3361.449 --> 3366.9990000000003
financially supporting me you think

3364.599 --> 3368.38
they're gonna watch every ad or you

3366.999 --> 3371.319
think they're gonna actually watch

3368.38 --> 3374.92
through my whole thing or are they just

3371.319 --> 3376.869
here to get their own little personal

3374.92 --> 3380.9790000000003
attention and to try to get in the way

3376.869 --> 3383.4990000000003
now they don't add anything people that

3380.979 --> 3386.89
add something are the ones that actually

3383.499 --> 3390.5789999999997
financially support me that become part

3386.89 --> 3393.8799999999997
of my patreon that send me super chats

3390.579 --> 3396.489
through the PayPal or that donate in the

3393.88 --> 3399.549
Super chats here in Google those are the

3396.489 --> 3403.9
ones that are actually helping me not a

3399.549 --> 3406.359
bunch of goofing around idiots they

3403.9 --> 3409.869
don't help me at all I could ban

3406.359 --> 3414.029
hundreds of them and it would not impact

3409.869 --> 3414.029
my financial situation at all

3425.44 --> 3437.33
sure ISA I just had just I just had to I

3431.98 --> 3440.15
just didn't think it was funny you know

3437.33 --> 3443.33
if you're gonna use the word demon and

3440.15 --> 3445.73
then have a happy smiley in the same

3443.33 --> 3450.59
sentence no matter really the intention

3445.73 --> 3453.16
is wrong because demons are not funny at

3450.59 --> 3453.1600000000003
all

3453.97 --> 3461.0
so I I could have timed them out but I

3458.0 --> 3464.18
just you know I'm at this moment I'm

3461.0 --> 3465.86
just very intolerant I am just kind of

3464.18 --> 3469.85
really sick of this

3465.86 --> 3471.6200000000003
oh it's kind of funny this does seem a

3469.85 --> 3473.5699999999997
little bit more silly than usual maybe

3471.62 --> 3477.17
we should take this as a cue to start

3473.57 --> 3481.52
goofing around and make careless jokes

3477.17 --> 3484.91
about it no no that's absolutely not the

3481.52 --> 3490.12
signal that I'm giving here this is all

3484.91 --> 3490.12
very serious very serious and that

3490.24 --> 3497.18
automated making fun of it response is

3493.4 --> 3500.21
part of the indoctrination conditioning

3497.18 --> 3503.0299999999997
against all of this it's like the

3500.21 --> 3506.53
cultural cute for you to start wobbling

3503.03 --> 3510.2900000000004
around and have fun because it's

3506.53 --> 3512.9300000000003
conditioned for that do you understand

3510.29 --> 3515.06
do you understand the the forces that

3512.93 --> 3517.0699999999997
you are literally now as you're watching

3515.06 --> 3519.38
this as you're interacting with me the

3517.07 --> 3523.25
forces you are being subjected to do you

3519.38 --> 3527.54
understand that that you from the inside

3523.25 --> 3530.81
have been conditioned Pavlovian lee to

3527.54 --> 3533.42
have fun to goof around every time

3530.81 --> 3536.17
bigfoot is brought up yeah

3533.42 --> 3536.17
do you realize that

3552.86 --> 3560.31
it's there I think the vast majority of

3557.97 --> 3562.4399999999996
people have that type of response even

3560.31 --> 3565.41
the people that are very composed

3562.44 --> 3569.4
normally are having this response in my

3565.41 --> 3572.0

3569.4 --> 3572.0
few of them

3587.58 --> 3594.98
okay Bates RMC 60 MC please take care of

3592.53 --> 3594.98
that caps

3607.2 --> 3613.77
not yet septic but I will because yeah

3611.46 --> 3617.79
that's that's a soccer car I don't

3613.77 --> 3620.25
appreciate you making soccer counts so

3617.79 --> 3622.38
if I see anything that I don't like

3620.25 --> 3625.77
about what you say in my chat you're

3622.38 --> 3627.75
gonna be banned again and again and

3625.77 --> 3629.339
again and again and then after a while

3627.75 --> 3631.17
when I notice that you keep on making

3629.339 --> 3634.23
your sock accounts I'll give you a

3631.17 --> 3636.599
permanent ban and I'll then start to

3634.23 --> 3640.79
treat you the same way as treat Jason

3636.599 --> 3650.099
McCormick and ban you with the slightest

3640.79 --> 3654.0299999999997
feel of your presence this is not a sock

3650.099 --> 3656.79
account didn't i ban you okay I'm

3654.03 --> 3659.25
confused here yeah it's just a lot of

3656.79 --> 3664.74
banning going around but I also

3659.25 --> 3668.9
time-outs I'm just kind of trigger-happy

3664.74 --> 3672.9199999999996
right now so just don't piss me off

3668.9 --> 3672.92
okay cept a p5

3677.58 --> 3680.65
[Music]

3687.95 --> 3700.46
yeah it's yeah the whole Karen be stream

3698.18 --> 3703.52
yesterday just inspired me so heavily

3700.46 --> 3706.0
that really kept me up all night but

3703.52 --> 3711.43
there's also these special moments

3706.0 --> 3716.589
because I genuinely wonder sometimes now

3711.43 --> 3720.23
are there Bigfoot like from this region

3716.589 --> 3725.0
in this region because this is kind of

3720.23 --> 3727.099
like this side of of the city with a lot

3725.0 --> 3730.78
of woods and green and there's basically

3727.099 --> 3736.07
plenty of space and hey I've had a lot

3730.78 --> 3738.5
of owl noises like a lot of them this is

3736.07 --> 3742.04
her throughout the year it's like

3738.5 --> 3744.109
sometimes almost seems like really is

3742.04 --> 3746.63
this some kind of OWL hive or is

3744.109 --> 3749.39
something are this are these creatures

3746.63 --> 3751.88
are people making that noise so who

3749.39 --> 3754.04
knows they have maybe maybe they have

3751.88 --> 3759.38
come like moved into the region and

3754.04 --> 3763.609
sometimes like want to feel my presence

3759.38 --> 3767.78
and I don't know what that is but I do

3763.609 --> 3770.48
find it very fascinating everything that

3767.78 --> 3772.73
she said about experiences with Bigfoot

3770.48 --> 3776.8
and that they apparently do use that

3772.73 --> 3776.8
type of communication it's fascinating

3778.119 --> 3784.19
they live wherever habitat is remote and

3781.67 --> 3790.73
suitable yeah well they could be wood

3784.19 --> 3794.2000000000003
you know you could it be that that they

3790.73 --> 3798.079
travel that they go out of their way to

3794.2 --> 3800.81
maybe do stuff at times that they would

3798.079 --> 3803.54
generally live at a very remote place of

3800.81 --> 3805.609
course but who knows that some of them

3803.54 --> 3808.369
maybe have some like adventuring

3805.609 --> 3812.0499999999997
tendencies and go we'll look up things

3808.369 --> 3812.05
or people who knows

3813.02 --> 3819.9
now not nomads they would be adventuring

3817.26 --> 3822.42
they would in a little group then

3819.9 --> 3826.79
potentially get away from the regular

3822.42 --> 3831.56
living place closer to civilization and

3826.79 --> 3835.05
goof around see what's out there

3831.56 --> 3840.06
yeah well Bigfoot is just the name for

3835.05 --> 3842.3100000000004
the USA there's Bigfoot yetis these

3840.06 --> 3852.21
types of creature are everywhere on

3842.31 --> 3854.48
every continent yeah so it's not just

3852.21 --> 3857.4
the United States just the United States

3854.48 --> 3861.21
took it upon themselves to make this

3857.4 --> 3868.26
kind of ridiculous funny legend about

3861.21 --> 3871.62
them but their days are supposed to be

3868.26 --> 3873.6000000000004
yeah there's legendary references and

3871.62 --> 3874.83
mythical references at least of them

3873.6 --> 3878.0699999999997
everywhere

3874.83 --> 3879.75
this is everywhere because they are

3878.07 --> 3881.9700000000003
everywhere they probably always have

3879.75 --> 3884.67
been everywhere and yeah human

3881.97 --> 3891.4199999999996
controllers don't like that they don't

3884.67 --> 3894.57
like it you know I bet big feet are just

3891.42 --> 3896.4500000000003
excellent spell breakers that if

3894.57 --> 3900.51
somebody's in some kind of psychological

3896.45 --> 3903.39
delusion or some delirium mentally that

3900.51 --> 3906.3
they could if they chose to just

3903.39 --> 3909.98
approach those people and just snap them

3906.3 --> 3914.19
out of it with like a depolarized snap

3909.98 --> 3917.34
just click switch them out of their

3914.19 --> 3920.16
freaking physical induced delusional

3917.34 --> 3926.73
state I bet they could do that something

3920.16 --> 3933.45
like that so yeah controllers who aspire

3926.73 --> 3935.25
to use delusion and - yeah deranged

3933.45 --> 3936.5099999999998
people and turn them into slaves yeah

3935.25 --> 3939.24
they're not gonna like these creatures

3936.51 --> 3943.23
at all because they do it's they stand

3939.24 --> 3946.339
and do exactly the opposite of what they

3943.23 --> 3946.339
the controllers want

3947.68 --> 3950.7999999999997
[Music]

3956.24 --> 3960.64
now if we came I think that they are

3960.88 --> 3968.51
flesh born natural creatures that just

3966.14 --> 3971.5989999999997
have this extra dimensional capability

3968.51 --> 3973.55
as you could call their phasing ability

3971.599 --> 3979.01
and they're probably not even the only

3973.55 --> 3982.07
ones it's probably more creatures out

3979.01 --> 3986.9900000000002
there that can do it and basically have

3982.07 --> 3989.15
cloaking capability so yeah and how do

3986.99 --> 3991.31
you even recognize that you know you'd

3989.15 --> 3996.05
have to catch them in the moment of

3991.31 --> 3997.73
cloaking or D cloaking and anything any

3996.05 --> 3999.32
creature that could do that I would

3997.73 --> 4001.39
predict would have some kind of

3999.32 --> 4004.42
spiritual sensitivity so they would

4001.39 --> 4007.98
prevent themselves from being discovered

4004.42 --> 4014.2200000000003
because they have proximity alert to it

4007.98 --> 4020.2
no demons not demons this is nature a

4014.22 --> 4026.3199999999997
natural physiological ability it's no

4020.2 --> 4030.3999999999996
magic there's no extra spirits evil

4026.32 --> 4033.6400000000003
spirits blood no this is physiology it's

4030.4 --> 4036.28
a physical natural ability it's amazing

4033.64 --> 4040.5989999999997
it's just as amazing as a bumblebee

4036.28 --> 4045.0
being able to fly yeah and that's an

4040.599 --> 4047.53
open mystery it has these unique

4045.0 --> 4050.38
physiological capacities because of its

4047.53 --> 4052.8100000000004
design that that freakin weird heavy

4050.38 --> 4055.81
thing top heavy thing can actually fly

4052.81 --> 4057.16
around yeah should be normally

4055.81 --> 4059.29
impossible but because of the

4057.16 --> 4063.64
electrostatic abilities it can do that

4059.29 --> 4067.74
well guess what Bigfoot cloak is just

4063.64 --> 4073.0499999999997
like that it's natural natural born

4067.74 --> 4073.0499999999997
physiological ability that's right

4076.5 --> 4079.599
[Music]

4080.24 --> 4087.72
it's alright yeah I've heard about that

4085.38 --> 4090.0
a long time ago I was kind of

4087.72 --> 4092.73
fascinating that as teenager Fyodor

4090.0 --> 4096.75
Dostoevsky the Kookaburra are like the

4092.73 --> 4101.359
one of the weirdest birds ever they they

4096.75 --> 4104.73
are the troll birds they are trolls

4101.359 --> 4108.83
incarnate in bird form and they love to

4104.73 --> 4112.589
screw around with people and everything

4108.83 --> 4117.2699999999995
like those creatures are practical

4112.589 --> 4120.8099999999995
jokers like if they could find they

4117.27 --> 4123.259
would yeah they would [ __ ] on people's

4120.81 --> 4139.89
heads if they could aim for that

4123.259 --> 4142.699
literally total prankster creatures yeah

4139.89 --> 4142.6990000000005
but there's birds

4146.7 --> 4152.44
Magpies are evil

4149.589 --> 4155.89
well these Magpies that I've been seeing

4152.44 --> 4157.8099999999995
that literally just attack people like

4155.89 --> 4161.410000000001
on a bike or what yeah those seem pretty

4157.81 --> 4163.18
nasty like very brutally territorial but

4161.41 --> 4166.0599999999995
that's not like the back I thought I

4163.18 --> 4168.97
mused there's Magpies over here and yeah

4166.06 --> 4171.76
they are kind of like they're bit

4168.97 --> 4176.109
devious in nature as it were but not

4171.76 --> 4178.56
evil they don't attack people so it's

4176.109 --> 4178.56
weird

4188.839 --> 4195.0199999999995
I don't know about the language thing

4191.0 --> 4197.05
though they are very smart I don't know

4195.02 --> 4199.909000000001
about the language thing they have

4197.05 --> 4202.369000000001
detailed communication interaction and

4199.909 --> 4204.558999999999
I've studied that little so I agree that

4202.369 --> 4208.369
there is complex communication going on

4204.559 --> 4210.8
but to claim that they have the most

4208.369 --> 4214.159
complex language of all birds I think

4210.8 --> 4217.25
that's I don't think that's actually

4214.159 --> 4219.289
based on an anything real I think that's

4217.25 --> 4221.98
just that the conceptual idea you're

4219.289 --> 4221.98
putting forward

4243.26 --> 4253.7300000000005
okay well that's really nice that you

4247.53 --> 4253.73
have this reliable informant goody

4269.24 --> 4273.66
yeah they do like to screw around but

4271.53 --> 4276.3
you know what let's get back to Bigfoot

4273.66 --> 4278.07
because that is probably what was the

4276.3 --> 4280.41
attempt in the first place to get the

4278.07 --> 4283.08
subject away so people can have some

4280.41 --> 4285.15
reason and just not contemplate on weird

4283.08 --> 4288.2699999999995
mystical creatures that have been around

4285.15 --> 4293.3099999999995
forever and have been forced ridiculed

4288.27 --> 4295.4400000000005
upon us just like the forced ridicule of

4293.31 --> 4297.8
Flat Earth so I'm gonna get back to that

4295.44 --> 4302.37
oh damn

4297.8 --> 4310.49
well I've actually been going for a long

4302.37 --> 4310.49
time and leave it I lost track of time

4326.739 --> 4332.808999999999
yeah I think it's good time to round out

4329.51 --> 4335.289000000001
this silly little show that's not that

4332.809 --> 4339.469
silly icky it's actually really really

4335.289 --> 4341.329
serious but yeah this just it's kind of

4339.469 --> 4345.05
out of left field concerning what I

4341.329 --> 4347.889
typically do so I get that people just

4345.05 --> 4351.05
can't handle it I'm just going nuts and

4347.889 --> 4353.150000000001

4351.05 --> 4353.929
about freaking Bigfoot everyday so don't

4353.15 --> 4356.03
worry about it

4353.929 --> 4360.11
but I'm keeping it in there I'm taking

4356.03 --> 4362.239
this very serious there's something to

4360.11 --> 4365.96
Bigfoot something important for me

4362.239 --> 4367.75
personally because I am very sensitive I

4365.96 --> 4371.3
am

4367.75 --> 4373.699
all about that all about the ethereal

4371.3 --> 4375.71
and the extra dimensional experiences

4373.699 --> 4378.32
and the dark world and all that is my

4375.71 --> 4380.389
thing everybody knows this now I'm

4378.32 --> 4383.449
pretty much as much as an extra

4380.389 --> 4386.599
dimensional wizard an actual wizard and

4383.449 --> 4389.989
not a fabricator of stories and lies as

4386.599 --> 4392.900000000001
they come so it is part of what I'm

4389.989 --> 4395.299999999999
gonna be doing and I want to learn more

4392.9 --> 4398.329
I want to see what these creatures know

4395.3 --> 4400.639
