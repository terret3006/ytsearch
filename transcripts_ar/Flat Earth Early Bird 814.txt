but it's yeah it's really nice

107.759 --> 115.84
temperature

109.92 --> 115.84
kind of moist but just very nice

116.719 --> 119.28
and sunny

126.64 --> 133.76
all right so it's

130.16 --> 142.8
tuesday the 23rd

133.76 --> 145.84
of february 2021

142.8 --> 150.0
uh mind of god is first in chat

145.84 --> 152.879
hey neil cosentino good to see you

150.0 --> 152.879
you're up early

154.48 --> 158.48
oh and tom parker

164.56 --> 168.879
so yeah i got up pretty early today as

166.64 --> 168.879
well

169.04 --> 176.319
some really important things i had to

172.239 --> 179.20000000000002
try and arrange didn't exactly work out

176.319 --> 179.2
as i thought it would

182.239 --> 186.0
but yeah i don't know

189.92 --> 194.64
with all the issues going on in the

192.159 --> 198.07999999999998
background yeah i

194.64 --> 201.83999999999997
i do tend to just wake up earlier anyway

198.08 --> 205.68
because of that so i was up at

201.84 --> 208.72
10 today and i don't know with

205.68 --> 210.64000000000001
with just the morning and this nice

208.72 --> 213.84
weather it wasn't actually even that bad

210.64 --> 213.83999999999997
to get up early

222.64 --> 227.83999999999997
so how are you all doing

230.0 --> 233.92
i thought yesterday's show was pretty

231.68 --> 233.92000000000002
good

234.799 --> 241.84
yesterday's flat earth early bird

238.56 --> 244.56
and so was the flat earth debates

241.84 --> 244.56
although i

245.04 --> 251.92
uh i did miss most of the show

249.2 --> 254.0
like halfway the regular show i kind of

251.92 --> 255.67999999999998
went out for groceries

254.0 --> 257.199
it all took a little longer than i

255.68 --> 259.6
expected then

257.199 --> 261.68
when i got back well this day after show

259.6 --> 264.88
was still running

261.68 --> 264.88
but i missed most of it

266.84 --> 271.67999999999995
eh

269.68 --> 274.32
there are some good flat earth debate

271.68 --> 274.32
premieres

276.4 --> 280.88
that i followed with the jet and all

278.56 --> 285.04
that and oh yeah the weird situation

280.88 --> 288.96
flat earth folker in a

285.04 --> 292.32
dutch restaurant in canada

288.96 --> 296.0
and it was like a mask protest

292.32 --> 298.96
thing so that happened

296.0 --> 299.84
i got into that show late but then i

298.96 --> 303.039
scrolled back

299.84 --> 303.039
to when that was going on

308.72 --> 312.0
so that happened uh

317.36 --> 325.28000000000003
are you guys still on lockdown

320.96 --> 327.84
i think so i'm not entirely sure

325.28 --> 339.84
there's a lot of hassle going on in

327.84 --> 339.84
dutch politics currently

358.16 --> 360.40000000000003
uh

361.84 --> 367.84
hello cameron kamegazi gilmore

378.84 --> 381.84
alright

388.0 --> 395.199
right so yeah i'm up for whatever

392.16 --> 398.47900000000004
whatever subjects again

395.199 --> 400.88
it was kind of funny having uh like

398.479 --> 402.08
spending so much attention to ballers in

400.88 --> 405.44
chat

402.08 --> 407.52
as i have recently and it's been halfway

405.44 --> 410.96
interesting

407.52 --> 412.88
i get out my moments but i also am

410.96 --> 414.96
addressing

412.88 --> 416.88
some serious behavior and i'm getting

414.96 --> 419.919
halfway recognition so that's a

416.88 --> 419.919
that's at least something

420.84 --> 423.84
uh

427.919 --> 431.19899999999996
write it oh tom parker yeah i i did see

430.56 --> 434.56
the

431.199 --> 437.84000000000003
andy kaufman video don't know about tom

434.56 --> 437.84
cohen though

439.28 --> 442.88
but that's been it's been a while

444.56 --> 448.24
you know i'm not really particularly

447.12 --> 450.88
interesting

448.24 --> 452.88
interested anymore at this moment to

450.88 --> 455.28
hear people's stories

452.88 --> 457.68
about the virus because it's pretty much

455.28 --> 457.67999999999995
settled

458.319 --> 461.91900000000004
i've gotten a lot of information pretty

460.479 --> 465.12
early on

461.919 --> 468.08
and everything else most of

465.12 --> 469.84000000000003
most attention right now that's being sp

468.08 --> 473.12
being

469.84 --> 476.08
spent by people

473.12 --> 476.08
trying to sort of like

477.12 --> 484.24
bring the alarm about the situation are

480.24 --> 486.56
emphasizing just the the flawed nature

484.24 --> 489.52
of the applied policies

486.56 --> 491.52
and how there is political abuse of it

489.52 --> 494.79999999999995
rather than even addressing whether the

491.52 --> 494.79999999999995
virus is there or not

498.319 --> 502.16
because it's not even relevant anymore

500.72 --> 503.91900000000004
whether it's real or not

502.16 --> 505.199
it's just that the policies don't make

503.919 --> 506.79999999999995
any sense

505.199 --> 509.12
and are still being forced through and

506.8 --> 510.8
that's become like the attention point

509.12 --> 513.2
more

510.8 --> 515.519
than the nature of the virus or what

513.2 --> 518.88
viruses even are

515.519 --> 522.159
these this guy addresses it

518.88 --> 522.159
yeah i know

530.72 --> 537.0400000000001
okay that mind of god i thought

534.0 --> 540.0
i've been pretty persistent in my

537.04 --> 541.8389999999999
explanation about viruses

540.0 --> 543.839
don't think there is a real physical

541.839 --> 547.6
virus well i don't think that

543.839 --> 550.5600000000001
viruses work that way

547.6 --> 551.279
in that sense what we are being informed

550.56 --> 554.4799999999999
about

551.279 --> 555.92
with viruses aren't really what they say

554.48 --> 559.44
that is

555.92 --> 563.8389999999999
i think if virus viruses in general

559.44 --> 566.399
are body inherent mechanisms

563.839 --> 567.839
that are secondary they're reactionary

566.399 --> 570.8
to other things

567.839 --> 573.2
so it's not something you can literally

570.8 --> 576.24
be infected by there's other

573.2 --> 579.76
processes that cause that

576.24 --> 582.399
not like with hostile bacteria an

579.76 --> 582.399
invasion

584.959 --> 605.8389999999999
what chicken fox i don't know

588.16 --> 605.8389999999999
are chicken a virus

609.44 --> 623.839
right it's said to be because of a virus

619.839 --> 627.9200000000001
i did yeah i've had chickenpox

623.839 --> 630.32
but i don't know exactly what it is

627.92 --> 631.519
that is causing that i know that it is

630.32 --> 647.839
infectious

631.519 --> 647.839
i guess

658.839 --> 663.9200000000001
um

660.0 --> 666.32
wait smallpox

663.92 --> 667.279
i didn't have chickenpox smallpox i got

666.32 --> 675.839
smallplugs

667.279 --> 675.8389999999999
it's apparently different

680.079 --> 688.16
right so i do know that

684.24 --> 691.2
that is a thing i don't

688.16 --> 695.12
know however exactly

691.2 --> 697.76
what alternative theorists medical

695.12 --> 699.76
theorists would typically say about that

697.76 --> 701.519
although i'm pretty sure they have full

699.76 --> 705.04
works because

701.519 --> 707.44
the alternative medical

705.04 --> 709.92
theories and the people that develop

707.44 --> 713.9200000000001
them have been added for

709.92 --> 715.279
almost a century so i'm pretty sure they

713.92 --> 720.0
have

715.279 --> 720.0
an explanation for what it exactly is

728.839 --> 731.839
right

739.12 --> 746.72
if there's yeah so thanks for asking

742.56 --> 746.7199999999999
i don't know exactly what chickenpox are

747.2 --> 752.639
let's classify the virus or

750.32 --> 755.839
has it actually like the element has it

752.639 --> 759.839
been put under a microscope is it like

755.839 --> 759.839
very direct what is it

762.72 --> 766.8000000000001
chickenpox has an element of bacteria

765.36 --> 769.44
right

766.8 --> 772.16
that is it is all about the contact all

769.44 --> 775.519
about the

772.16 --> 780.24
yeah and saliva and all that

775.519 --> 781.2
but never been isolated right so there

780.24 --> 784.24
you go it's

781.2 --> 784.639
like oh it's something in this it's just

784.24 --> 787.839
not

784.639 --> 788.399
regular bacteria so we don't know we're

787.839 --> 791.44
so

788.399 --> 793.839
i guess assuming that it is a virus

791.44 --> 801.839
must be too small to figure out or

793.839 --> 801.839
something i don't know

804.88 --> 815.8389999999999
yeah it is weird isn't it

832.32 --> 837.6800000000001
yeah in ways like it is it would be

835.279 --> 841.04
interesting to study it

837.68 --> 845.12
really on a microbiological scale

841.04 --> 848.48
to figure out okay so what exactly

845.12 --> 851.44
what isolated type of thing

848.48 --> 852.32
within that situation is the actual

851.44 --> 855.12
cause

852.32 --> 856.24
of the disease of the spreading

855.12 --> 859.36
specifically

856.24 --> 861.04
can you isolate it right that's that

859.36 --> 862.16
would be interesting to have a deeper

861.04 --> 865.519
study into that

862.16 --> 871.8389999999999
concerning chickenpox that is because

865.519 --> 871.839
that is much more direct right it's a

872.639 --> 881.12
yeah the infection

877.44 --> 884.1600000000001
element about it is much more blatant

881.12 --> 886.48
and direct compared to

884.16 --> 889.04
like things situations like having a

886.48 --> 889.04
cold or

896.839 --> 902.48
flu

898.8 --> 902.4799999999999
yeah so i've heard neil

908.48 --> 913.839
tom barnett explains all this video okay

910.839 --> 913.839
interesting

914.24 --> 919.279
thank you for i didn't know that iron 26

924.839 --> 927.839
hmm

938.839 --> 941.839
hmm

960.0 --> 967.92
yeah neil yeah well i had smallpox

965.04 --> 969.8389999999999
when i was a kid right when i was going

967.92 --> 974.24
on a vacation

969.839 --> 976.8000000000001
to spain so i couldn't get in the pool

974.24 --> 978.32
with that that was extremely annoying

976.8 --> 980.8
and

978.32 --> 982.1600000000001
like with me it wasn't really just

980.8 --> 984.959
itching it was

982.16 --> 984.959
kind of painful

992.959 --> 999.8389999999999
but it's a long time ago that's like wow

996.399 --> 1000.48
25 no wait 35 years ago something like

999.839 --> 1011.839
that

1000.48 --> 1011.839
it's a long time ago yeah

1020.0 --> 1024.4
oh wow you're being told something and

1022.079 --> 1026.72
you believed it

1024.4 --> 1026.72
cool

1027.439 --> 1031.76
just so you know i've been hearing

1029.439 --> 1035.039
exactly similar messages to

1031.76 --> 1039.28
what you're saying right now in the last

1035.039 --> 1041.679
six years on the yeah yearly basis

1039.28 --> 1043.28
from several different people some

1041.679 --> 1046.48
people that even really like

1043.28 --> 1049.52
dedicate a youtube channel to that

1046.48 --> 1053.1200000000001
thing right it's been all over the place

1049.52 --> 1054.96
constantly and even before the flatter

1053.12 --> 1059.36
scene

1054.96 --> 1059.3600000000001
it was go it's been going forever

1060.96 --> 1066.48
so i yeah in my personal opinion

1064.559 --> 1069.039
it's kind of pointless to wait for the

1066.48 --> 1071.84
return of christ

1069.039 --> 1072.559
it's like maybe you should let him

1071.84 --> 1075.1999999999998
return

1072.559 --> 1075.2
through you

1078.84 --> 1081.84
right

1090.24 --> 1096.799
so yeah but just roughly conceptually

1094.24 --> 1097.6
you know why wait for return when you

1096.799 --> 1102.8799999999999
could

1097.6 --> 1102.8799999999999
just try to summon him from within

1104.72 --> 1108.64
like try to be the christ you would like

1108.16 --> 1111.1200000000001
to see

1108.64 --> 1111.1200000000001
return

1111.84 --> 1115.52
i don't know does that make any sense

1115.919 --> 1123.8400000000001
it does make sense to me

1119.28 --> 1123.84
then again i am an esoteric christian so

1132.4 --> 1136.88
that what are you talking about we're

1135.679 --> 1139.6000000000001
commanded to be

1136.88 --> 1140.64
aware of the timing of his return that's

1139.6 --> 1142.0
nonsense

1140.64 --> 1144.0800000000002
it's actually quite the object

1142.0 --> 1146.4
specifically said that nobody knows the

1144.08 --> 1146.3999999999999
time

1147.84 --> 1155.28
nobody knows exactly when

1151.2 --> 1165.8400000000001
so yeah i've contradicting

1155.28 --> 1165.84
information my god

1176.64 --> 1193.8400000000001
he gives us all the signs

1201.2 --> 1204.32
does say to watch well that's just

1203.919 --> 1208.0800000000002
called

1204.32 --> 1211.039
vigilance that's inherent

1208.08 --> 1213.28
anybody walking the path would always

1211.039 --> 1215.679
have to be vigilant

1213.28 --> 1216.3999999999999
so yeah watch pay attention as to what

1215.679 --> 1220.159
things are

1216.4 --> 1220.5590000000002
what's happening that doesn't imply that

1220.159 --> 1224.96
he

1220.559 --> 1224.96

i just know

1505.919 --> 1509.76
yeah i don't know if i should be naming

1508.0 --> 1513.12
the name but i don't know who

1509.76 --> 1516.4
that person is but thank you

1513.12 --> 1516.3999999999999
for the paypal donation

1519.919 --> 1531.3600000000001
every bit helps

1528.72 --> 1531.919
right so yeah guys sorry if i seem a

1531.36 --> 1533.9189999999999
little

1531.919 --> 1535.5200000000002
slower than usual it's just that i'm

1533.919 --> 1538.0
under kind of attention

1535.52 --> 1539.2
and it's no use talking about it because

1538.0 --> 1542.88
it's it's really

1539.2 --> 1546.4
nothing complicated it's just tension

1542.88 --> 1550.159
from the situation i'm in it it's very

1546.4 --> 1550.159
distracting it makes me very nervous

1552.159 --> 1557.919
and it even keeps me up at night

1555.2 --> 1559.679
but i will survive through it i am a lot

1557.919 --> 1561.44
calmer than i used to be like

1559.679 --> 1563.6000000000001
this sort of thing is not the first time

1561.44 --> 1566.64
right

1563.6 --> 1570.24
but now i do

1566.64 --> 1573.3600000000001
feel much more in control on average

1570.24 --> 1576.4
but the nerves are still kind of

1573.36 --> 1579.12
getting in my way it's just i'm not

1576.4 --> 1581.3600000000001
panicking anymore it's just still very

1579.12 --> 1581.36
very

1582.32 --> 1585.84
very it's still strenuous

1597.12 --> 1601.84
also because yeah i was gonna seek uh

1602.24 --> 1605.36
like legal help

1606.24 --> 1612.32
but yeah my lawyer that i kind of

1609.52 --> 1612.8799999999999
was in contact with before let me know

1612.32 --> 1615.36
that

1612.88 --> 1617.2
he couldn't go against it apparently

1615.36 --> 1618.8799999999999
because he was

1617.2 --> 1620.88
like he knew the guy or something so

1618.88 --> 1623.919
there would be personal

1620.88 --> 1625.279
entanglements then he just said okay

1623.919 --> 1629.279
just go back to the

1625.279 --> 1631.44
original office to get that help

1629.279 --> 1633.6
and guess what it was freaking close due

1631.44 --> 1633.919
to corona and it even said like oh just

1633.6 --> 1636.6399999999999
call

1633.919 --> 1637.76
us yeah i called you like literally no

1636.64 --> 1639.8400000000001
phone

1637.76 --> 1641.52
like it's disconnected it's not it's the

1639.84 --> 1645.039
system is not picking up

1641.52 --> 1647.84
ever so it's just forever ringing

1645.039 --> 1649.6
really weird so now i have to somehow

1647.84 --> 1651.4399999999998
figure out how to do that

1649.6 --> 1654.7199999999998
and i don't like that it's like that

1651.44 --> 1657.8400000000001
it's very bizarre

1654.72 --> 1659.919
because the situation is

1657.84 --> 1662.559
yeah i don't have that much time to

1659.919 --> 1664.48
waste on this nonsense

1662.559 --> 1666.799
i really have to get it figured out or

1664.48 --> 1667.52
otherwise i don't know i might be

1666.799 --> 1672.1589999999999
somehow

1667.52 --> 1675.279
forced to suddenly move

1672.159 --> 1678.24
which is going to be a huge impact even

1675.279 --> 1678.24
just on my health

1678.399 --> 1681.84
don't look forward to that being the

1680.24 --> 1684.08
case and i thought that it wouldn't

1681.84 --> 1686.32
nothing has really changed

1684.08 --> 1686.32
but

1687.12 --> 1693.1999999999998
i don't know i'm very nervous about it

1690.62 --> 1696.32
[Music]

1693.2 --> 1701.1200000000001
i need to read some stoic philosophy no

1696.32 --> 1701.12
thanks why would it do that

1705.6 --> 1710.399
something great might happen but well if

1707.36 --> 1711.4399999999998
there is a place to move to and you know

1710.399 --> 1715.76
this place

1711.44 --> 1718.3990000000001
despite the landlord is really good

1715.76 --> 1718.8799999999999
it's a great place i really like it here

1718.399 --> 1720.559
i've

1718.88 --> 1723.2
really kind of settled in i've been

1720.559 --> 1726.6399999999999
living here now for seven years

1723.2 --> 1729.76
and it is kind of my home even though i

1726.64 --> 1729.76
never meant it to be

1731.6 --> 1734.799
just happened to become it

1735.84 --> 1743.84
so finding a new place is going to be

1739.76 --> 1743.84
very difficult one way or the other

1747.679 --> 1750.799
at least until i i get a better picture

1750.48 --> 1753.6
on

1750.799 --> 1755.679
my financial situation but it'll take

1753.6 --> 1758.24
some time to figure that out exactly

1755.679 --> 1762.96
where i'm at

1758.24 --> 1762.96
once that situation happens in a week

1763.919 --> 1768.0
it's not like oh yeah now immediately

1766.24 --> 1770.48
once a change happened i can just

1768.0 --> 1770.799
immediately size up exactly what i can

1770.48 --> 1773.84
do

1770.799 --> 1776.8799999999999
no not at all

1773.84 --> 1776.8799999999999
to be very careful

1779.12 --> 1795.84
i wish youtube would just stop stalling

1796.72 --> 1809.84
what are you doing

1811.679 --> 1817.44
well tiny wumble yeah you can ask since

1814.96 --> 1820.72
i basically brought it forth

1817.44 --> 1823.76
but it is because

1820.72 --> 1826.799
yeah because my landlord just wants me

1823.76 --> 1827.36
out of here he's like put his mind to

1826.799 --> 1829.12
that

1827.36 --> 1830.8799999999999
and there's just no reasoning with him

1829.12 --> 1832.799
and he's like really nitpicking

1830.88 --> 1837.8400000000001
collecting

1832.799 --> 1837.84
dirt that's what he's trying

1838.0 --> 1842.32
and there's other people apparently in

1840.0 --> 1844.48
this building he's conspiring with

1842.32 --> 1846.72
you like talk them into it like i'm this

1844.48 --> 1849.1200000000001
bad man

1846.72 --> 1850.48
and every time i get a little loud and

1849.12 --> 1853.9189999999999
that's not often at

1850.48 --> 1856.32
all sometimes i do

1853.919 --> 1858.159
like get pissed off about something and

1856.32 --> 1861.6
i'm under tension and then it's like

1858.159 --> 1862.88
too loud right but it's not like i'm the

1861.6 --> 1865.039
only freaking one

1862.88 --> 1866.0800000000002
over area right it's not the only one in

1865.039 --> 1867.919
the building

1866.08 --> 1869.6
like even yesterday there was somebody

1867.919 --> 1871.6000000000001
getting really pissed off

1869.6 --> 1872.7199999999998
oh there's no police coming for that

1871.6 --> 1876.799
right

1872.72 --> 1878.72
so and i've never ever even done that to

1876.799 --> 1880.8799999999999
somebody's face like

1878.72 --> 1881.76
getting offensive in somebody's face

1880.88 --> 1885.2
ever

1881.76 --> 1889.039
ever even in circumstances where they

1885.2 --> 1892.72
[ __ ] did that to me yeah

1889.039 --> 1894.72
i'm so unbelievably well behaved

1892.72 --> 1896.559
and i have a zero criminal record

1894.72 --> 1898.08
there's literally nothing he can do

1896.559 --> 1900.1589999999999
that's

1898.08 --> 1902.559
what's really going on just because

1900.159 --> 1906.24
somebody calls police on some on me

1902.559 --> 1908.399
for no damn reason

1906.24 --> 1910.3990000000001
or for a reason because they were

1908.399 --> 1911.039
supposedly afraid blah blah blah

1910.399 --> 1912.799
whatever

1911.039 --> 1914.799
i've been living here for freaking seven

1912.799 --> 1918.84
years

1914.799 --> 1921.84
it's no reason to call the police for

1918.84 --> 1921.84
that

1922.399 --> 1931.4399999999998
right but he's trying to smear me

1927.36 --> 1934.1589999999999
and and use it to justify kicking me out

1931.44 --> 1934.88
but i've read into it the situation

1934.159 --> 1936.96
before

1934.88 --> 1938.7990000000002
with the other lawyer that's refusing

1936.96 --> 1941.039
now

1938.799 --> 1942.559
and he basically put down like yeah no

1941.039 --> 1945.84
you have

1942.559 --> 1948.24
uh what's it tenant rights and they're

1945.84 --> 1949.36
very hardcore there's really nothing he

1948.24 --> 1952.32
can do

1949.36 --> 1954.559
because i am not out of control i'm not

1952.32 --> 1956.72
like that guy that certainly just starts

1954.559 --> 1958.72
demolishing things or attacks somebody

1956.72 --> 1962.0
or whatever gets

1958.72 --> 1965.519
goes to jail right zero zero

1962.0 --> 1966.08
zero zero absolute hundred percent clean

1965.519 --> 1968.48
record

1966.08 --> 1971.1999999999998
i just got a police over a couple of

1968.48 --> 1972.96
times because i got a little loud

1971.2 --> 1974.48
and then immediately stopped as soon as

1972.96 --> 1977.76
i noticed that it was

1974.48 --> 1981.84
like too loud

1977.76 --> 1984.399
right so yeah i'm not a perfectly

1981.84 --> 1985.039
oh i am just this silent person that'll

1984.399 --> 1988.0
just do

1985.039 --> 1990.0
anything for everybody be everybody's

1988.0 --> 1992.799
slave yeah i'm not that right i have

1990.0 --> 1992.799
feelings i get

1993.6 --> 2001.12
a little stressed out sometimes

1996.88 --> 2004.159
so i do a lot of people but yeah it

2001.12 --> 2007.76
it's still just an unnerving situation

2004.159 --> 2010.64
because yeah because

2007.76 --> 2012.1589999999999
because of the so yeah not everything

2010.64 --> 2015.2
being readily available

2012.159 --> 2018.0
apparently corona closed down the

2015.2 --> 2019.44
the office for that sort of thing even

2018.0 --> 2020.799
though it's supposed yeah what am i

2019.44 --> 2023.039
supposed to be doing

2020.799 --> 2025.6
and i wonder like what are other people

2023.039 --> 2025.6
doing now

2026.08 --> 2030.0
if it's just closed just like that what

2028.88 --> 2032.5590000000002
non-essential

2030.0 --> 2033.039
judicial help is non-essential since

2032.559 --> 2035.44
when

2033.039 --> 2037.84
does that make any damn sense uh

2035.44 --> 2037.8400000000001
whatever

2044.88 --> 2051.04
foul when was the last time

2049.04 --> 2054.56
i've been at the synagogue i don't think

2051.04 --> 2058.079
i've ever been to a synagogue

2054.56 --> 2061.599
i've had well i guess dark world

2058.079 --> 2063.9190000000003
vision situations with synagogues

2061.599 --> 2066.2400000000002
and all that even remember being in

2063.919 --> 2068.879
really large libraries but i don't

2066.24 --> 2070.1589999999997
remember ever having physically gone to

2068.879 --> 2075.839
such place

2070.159 --> 2075.839
so i don't think i ever was there

2078.48 --> 2089.839
and i don't think they're gonna give me

2080.0 --> 2089.839
legal help i'm not jewish

2092.879 --> 2098.48
oh at least not like

2096.0 --> 2101.119
in any official capacity like that i'm

2098.48 --> 2101.119
not part of

2101.2 --> 2117.839
such circles you thought i was a jew

2118.96 --> 2126.079
now i i don't know i i do respect

2122.88 --> 2127.359
jews i there's some pretty awesome

2126.079 --> 2130.079
aspects about

2127.359 --> 2133.119
some of them and there's some really

2130.079 --> 2136.32
annoying aspects about others

2133.119 --> 2139.52
but i myself

2136.32 --> 2142.4
have never really yeah

2139.52 --> 2145.839
come officially jewish that i don't

2142.4 --> 2145.839
think i can

2146.0 --> 2152.079
like well you could like convert to

2149.2 --> 2153.68
it but then i would have to like get

2152.079 --> 2156.079
really strict with the book and then i

2153.68 --> 2159.2
have the same problems

2156.079 --> 2161.3590000000004
as with all the others

2159.2 --> 2162.96
i don't like to stick to a specific book

2161.359 --> 2165.68
i'm

2162.96 --> 2165.68
an eclectic

2166.8 --> 2170.1600000000003
i figure it out myself

2171.2 --> 2178.3199999999997
but i do appreciate wise teachings and

2174.4 --> 2182.8
interesting things and i even through my

2178.32 --> 2186.4
family we had a period

2182.8 --> 2190.32
like my very early teens where we were

2186.4 --> 2194.32
just going through religions

2190.32 --> 2197.3590000000004
to figure out what it is and i had

2194.32 --> 2199.839
yeah i found a lot of respect

2197.359 --> 2201.2
for jewish teachings and i even thought

2199.839 --> 2204.96
like yeah i like that

2201.2 --> 2210.24
more i like it more because it's smarter

2204.96 --> 2210.2400000000002
it's it's more logical in many ways

2212.0 --> 2216.0
but yeah not every freaking detail about

2214.8 --> 2218.7200000000003
it's just

2216.0 --> 2218.72
on the surface

2220.16 --> 2223.7599999999998
so i you could say that i had some

2222.48 --> 2229.839
affinity

2223.76 --> 2229.8390000000004
for the jewish religion

2245.44 --> 2250.16
no but anyway when it comes to the the

2248.0 --> 2253.92
situation that is constant

2250.16 --> 2258.7999999999997
currently unnerving me a little

2253.92 --> 2258.8
i'm just gonna go to the the regular guy

2259.119 --> 2266.56
like the social worker guy because they

2262.56 --> 2266.56
do still have plenty of connections

2269.359 --> 2272.96
it's a large jewish community isn't

2271.359 --> 2275.04
funny looks jewish too

2272.96 --> 2276.96
could we consider to come hey i'm not

2275.04 --> 2280.72
taking it as

2276.96 --> 2283.52
negative in a way i do appreciate it

2280.72 --> 2284.7999999999997
it's just that technically i'm not i'm

2283.52 --> 2288.28
kind of like a

2284.8 --> 2291.28
yeah eclectic weirdo

2288.28 --> 2291.28
non-traditionalist

2291.359 --> 2297.2
like if i was jewish if

2294.8 --> 2299.2000000000003
that's not what i am i would be like a

2297.2 --> 2302.96
leftist type jew

2299.2 --> 2305.2
that's like countering the rest pretty

2302.96 --> 2305.2
much

2306.16 --> 2309.2
very solitary

2311.119 --> 2318.1600000000003
but i yeah dude if if jews would like me

2315.76 --> 2320.6400000000003
or whatever or help me i would be

2318.16 --> 2320.64
honored

2323.839 --> 2328.56
being called jewish isn't absolutely an

2326.24 --> 2332.3199999999997
insult in 2021

2328.56 --> 2332.32
but that depends on the context

2332.4 --> 2337.76
you see if you're if you happen to be

2335.599 --> 2340.4
jewish

2337.76 --> 2341.6800000000003
and you kind of use it as a shield to

2340.4 --> 2344.0
prevent people from

2341.68 --> 2344.7999999999997
pointing out all kinds of nasty things

2344.0 --> 2349.28
you're doing

2344.8 --> 2349.28
and lies and [ __ ] yeah then

2349.44 --> 2352.88
it would be considered an insult but i

2351.599 --> 2355.92
think that's just people

2352.88 --> 2359.359
hiding under the

2355.92 --> 2361.28
their jewishness just using it as a

2359.359 --> 2363.52
shield

2361.28 --> 2365.3590000000004
because you're not supposed to be doing

2363.52 --> 2367.44
that as a jew

2365.359 --> 2369.839
you're not supposed to be lying all over

2367.44 --> 2369.839
the place

2371.04 --> 2376.32
and goading people into just like

2374.32 --> 2377.119
monstrous control that's not what god

2376.32 --> 2383.839
wants

2377.119 --> 2383.839
not even from the jews so

2391.96 --> 2395.17
[Music]

2399.68 --> 2403.9199999999996
ah right thank you i appreciate it i

2402.4 --> 2409.119
really appreciate it it's

2403.92 --> 2411.28
like jews so polarizing these days

2409.119 --> 2413.52
and especially like on this on the front

2411.28 --> 2416.079
line of conspiracy

2413.52 --> 2417.28
thinkers and people that hang in chats

2416.079 --> 2421.599
and get into

2417.28 --> 2424.6400000000003
text fights so polarizing

2421.599 --> 2425.2000000000003
it's so freaking polarizing so it's it

2424.64 --> 2429.839
makes me

2425.2 --> 2429.839
nervous every time and yeah i don't know

2429.92 --> 2441.6800000000003
face-to-face jews i used to

2438.0 --> 2441.68
but that's some time ago

2450.64 --> 2455.2799999999997
god is about freedom not enslavement

2455.839 --> 2459.7599999999998
that's a little complicated

2462.319 --> 2466.16
it's not necessarily about freedom it's

2465.2 --> 2468.319
about

2466.16 --> 2468.319
just

2470.96 --> 2474.2400000000002
treating others as you would treat

2472.48 --> 2477.76
yourself

2474.24 --> 2477.7599999999998
don't enslave others

2478.839 --> 2486.0789999999997
right you can enslave yourself

2482.96 --> 2488.64
but then you still have to reconcile

2486.079 --> 2490.5600000000004
because that's just it the sin part

2488.64 --> 2493.04
doesn't really matter how

2490.56 --> 2494.0789999999997
just when it happens there's a result

2493.04 --> 2496.88
it's the logos

2494.079 --> 2498.6400000000003
effect the part of the design it just

2496.88 --> 2500.8
happens

2498.64 --> 2503.04
it doesn't mean you can't do it it's

2500.8 --> 2509.8390000000004
just that it has consequences

2503.04 --> 2509.839
it always does like spiritually as well

2511.04 --> 2515.7599999999998
and yeah and what grabblers typically

2513.92 --> 2519.359
tend to do

2515.76 --> 2522.8
is like take this in and like try to

2519.359 --> 2526.4
master it like take control through

2522.8 --> 2529.92
just just going there

2526.4 --> 2533.52
like first thing with sin right

2529.92 --> 2537.2000000000003
sounds funny first i'm first right yeah

2533.52 --> 2538.16
they first with sin they see it as a

2537.2 --> 2540.96
market

2538.16 --> 2542.0789999999997
in in ways but now we're talking about

2540.96 --> 2545.359
grapplers and that's

2542.079 --> 2546.319
already quite practically the opposite

2545.359 --> 2551.839
of what

2546.319 --> 2551.839
a jew really should be doing

2562.839 --> 2565.839
right

2594.079 --> 2599.5600000000004
that's quite an accusation there tiny

2596.37 --> 2599.56
[Music]

2604.839 --> 2607.839
womble

2624.64 --> 2628.64
yeah that's a good point there minor god

2630.8 --> 2633.8390000000004
all right yeah well tiny wumble just

2633.28 --> 2636.96
imagine

2633.839 --> 2640.4
in a world where there's less

2636.96 --> 2643.28
much less cohesion much more wilderness

2640.4 --> 2645.359
impulses animal-like impulses that

2643.28 --> 2648.2400000000002
really have no

2645.359 --> 2650.88
structure in order to prevent that from

2648.24 --> 2653.839
dominating every single time

2650.88 --> 2656.4
or in a world where there is yeah much

2653.839 --> 2658.72
less cultural cohesion and all that

2656.4 --> 2662.48
slavery will have an all different type

2658.72 --> 2665.839
of functionality

2662.48 --> 2669.2
it's more like a micro kingdom it can be

2665.839 --> 2676.24
actually good it can be helpful

2669.2 --> 2676.72
in focus and all that right now course

2676.24 --> 2691.839
it can

2676.72 --> 2691.839
also lead to very bad things but

2695.52 --> 2700.8
oh really foul and buchanan jews are

2698.88 --> 2703.52
brought up in the religion to not feel

2700.8 --> 2707.3590000000004
shame over things like sex

2703.52 --> 2709.68
well in that case i'm not really a jew

2707.359 --> 2709.68
then

2709.92 --> 2714.96
because i try not to shame it

2715.2 --> 2721.2799999999997
but at the same time i do see it as

2719.599 --> 2722.6400000000003
something you have to be very careful

2721.28 --> 2726.1600000000003
with

2722.64 --> 2726.16
i take it very serious

2726.56 --> 2732.16
so but yeah just feeling shame

2730.16 --> 2734.8799999999997
universally when it happens is

2732.16 --> 2736.8799999999997
completely useless

2734.88 --> 2747.839
if you get like addicted to it it can

2736.88 --> 2747.839
absolutely just wreck your life

2761.68 --> 2766.319
okay gary herron now you're just wrong

2766.64 --> 2774.4
bible condones it it's ridiculous

2771.92 --> 2775.6800000000003
the bible really so where does christ

2774.4 --> 2777.359
condone it

2775.68 --> 2779.68
right we were talking about the old

2777.359 --> 2783.92
testament right that's not

2779.68 --> 2788.0789999999997
the bible you know christ

2783.92 --> 2791.839
is the bible and he does not condone

2788.079 --> 2791.8390000000004
he advises against it

2792.56 --> 2800.839
and he explains why so that's

2795.76 --> 2803.8390000000004
yeah quite out of place there gary

2800.839 --> 2803.839
herron

2840.48 --> 2845.839
hmm right anyway

2849.35 --> 2853.96
[Music]

2869.359 --> 2875.7599999999998
all right oh what's wrong with the

2872.72 --> 2879.2799999999997
old ten old commandments

2875.76 --> 2879.28
from the old testament what's wrong with

2884.839 --> 2887.839
that

2923.76 --> 2927.0400000000004
yeah i don't know gary herron i don't

2926.079 --> 2943.8390000000004
know what you're getting

2927.04 --> 2943.839
kind of stuck up about

2953.86 --> 2957.159
[Music]

2973.78 --> 2977.0690000000004
[Music]

2996.839 --> 2999.839
okay

3066.839 --> 3069.839
hmm

3074.86 --> 3078.05
[Music]

3092.559 --> 3099.599
foul number cannon oh that's

3095.599 --> 3102.1600000000003
that's a logical question to ask

3099.599 --> 3102.1600000000003
i don't know

3104.72 --> 3111.7599999999998
he he might have picked up

3107.76 --> 3112.48
on my stances on certain things that i

3111.76 --> 3114.88
would never

3112.48 --> 3115.599
face to face expressed to him so he

3114.88 --> 3118.88
might have

3115.599 --> 3122.079
watched some of my shows

3118.88 --> 3125.839
and he might be kind of like politically

3122.079 --> 3125.8390000000004
allergically triggered

3126.319 --> 3130.079
and i did a long longer time ago even

3128.88 --> 3133.44
told him that

3130.079 --> 3136.8
the earth is flat he didn't really

3133.44 --> 3138.7200000000003
counter or engage that

3136.8 --> 3140.8
but that might have accidentally been

3138.72 --> 3143.4399999999996
the start of him having like a

3140.8 --> 3145.44
like a permanent distrust type stance

3143.44 --> 3149.2000000000003
because it did kind of

3145.44 --> 3152.96
happen after that so

3149.2 --> 3167.68
could it be related to the show yes

3152.96 --> 3170.8
in an indirect sense

3167.68 --> 3171.359
but technically it's it just has to do

3170.8 --> 3175.04
with

3171.359 --> 3175.04
noise complaints that's it

3175.119 --> 3183.599
that's really the only thing

3181.44 --> 3185.68
and that's not noise from the show

3183.599 --> 3188.319
although that one time

3185.68 --> 3190.24
remember when i got was sick for a week

3188.319 --> 3190.5589999999997
and got better and i did a show and i

3190.24 --> 3193.7599999999998
got

3190.559 --> 3196.7200000000003
really furious just basically gone

3193.76 --> 3200.0
berserk and then the police came

3196.72 --> 3201.5989999999997
yeah that time yeah danny was during the

3200.0 --> 3205.04
show

3201.599 --> 3207.6800000000003
but that's yeah that only happened once

3205.04 --> 3208.8
and 82 happened but that's a long time

3207.68 --> 3212.16
ago

3208.8 --> 3212.1600000000003
never got a response to that

3213.52 --> 3223.839
other than on the internet

3233.839 --> 3241.52
exterminate them yeah

3238.16 --> 3243.2799999999997
sure he'd be wary that's right

3241.52 --> 3244.88
i don't know what he's even involved

3243.28 --> 3246.88
with you know

3244.88 --> 3249.119
could be some really creepy [ __ ] not

3246.88 --> 3252.2400000000002
saying that that he is

3249.119 --> 3254.2400000000002
allegedly whatever i don't have proof

3252.24 --> 3255.9199999999996
but i don't know what he is into and he

3254.24 --> 3259.359
might see my

3255.92 --> 3262.4
just non-cocking attitude as

3259.359 --> 3264.64
a more visceral threat i don't know what

3262.4 --> 3268.319
he's up to i've even

3264.64 --> 3271.52
spoken out that i don't like gayness

3268.319 --> 3273.839
i don't like homosexuality like

3271.52 --> 3275.52
don't hate him it's just that i find it

3273.839 --> 3279.52
really disgusting

3275.52 --> 3282.48
and it's no logos just it just isn't

3279.52 --> 3282.799
not saying that oh you have to then get

3282.48 --> 3285.92
all

3282.799 --> 3289.44
dramatic or extreme about it

3285.92 --> 3292.48
it's just that i don't like it and yeah

3289.44 --> 3296.559
never said anything

3292.48 --> 3299.599
homophobic to his face or anything

3296.559 --> 3299.599
because he is gay

3301.119 --> 3310.0
right so

3306.88 --> 3313.76
yeah plenty there's plenty of

3310.0 --> 3317.599
like reasons underneath for everything

3313.76 --> 3319.8390000000004
it's just that i'm doing my show

3317.599 --> 3323.28
and i'm doing it here and it's also in

3319.839 --> 3325.119
an indirect sense a source of income

3323.28 --> 3327.119
and i've been thinking like if he's

3325.119 --> 3328.2400000000002
really just constantly doing this [ __ ]

3327.119 --> 3330.559
to me and sending

3328.24 --> 3333.1189999999997
freaking letters to my dad and just

3330.559 --> 3337.2000000000003
completely out of control

3333.119 --> 3337.2000000000003
like maybe i should just sue him

3338.24 --> 3341.9199999999996
for disrupting my business

3343.76 --> 3347.119
for literally giving me heartache and

3346.0 --> 3349.92
sleepless nights

3347.119 --> 3352.0
for no damn reason even though i am

3349.92 --> 3355.2000000000003
extremely well behaved

3352.0 --> 3363.839
helpful i

3355.2 --> 3363.839
yeah it's i don't even

3371.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
just don't engage

3391.839 --> 3396.72
yeah yeah it is harassment that is

3402.559 --> 3407.0400000000004
but also like he in those letters he

3405.599 --> 3409.119
literally says

3407.04 --> 3410.72
like oh my god he's gonna go out of

3409.119 --> 3414.319
control and

3410.72 --> 3414.5589999999997
i'm so afraid and like i'm some kind of

3414.319 --> 3416.88
a

3414.559 --> 3418.88
completely out of control maniac that

3416.88 --> 3421.359
could literally just

3418.88 --> 3422.079
start attacking people that he that's

3421.359 --> 3426.319
how he

3422.079 --> 3429.52
writes about me like i'm a

3426.319 --> 3433.359
like a psychotic criminal or something

3429.52 --> 3436.88
literally he that's how he's

3433.359 --> 3436.88
spreading rumors about me

3439.52 --> 3445.28
so in a sense he's slandering me

3443.119 --> 3447.28
and he doesn't even do it to my face

3445.28 --> 3450.3190000000004
because to face to face he

3447.28 --> 3452.559
he keeps his tongue shut he even

3450.319 --> 3455.119
just has the gall to in the face of

3452.559 --> 3457.119
others praise me

3455.119 --> 3459.119
right while at the same time sending

3457.119 --> 3460.7200000000003
round letters about how i'm completely

3459.119 --> 3463.839
insane and dangerous

3460.72 --> 3465.2799999999997
like the guy is [ __ ] just freaking

3463.839 --> 3475.839
sociable

3465.28 --> 3475.8390000000004
give a [ __ ]

3476.16 --> 3479.2
i don't want to i don't want to make his

3478.799 --> 3482.319
life

3479.2 --> 3486.5589999999997
worse right

3482.319 --> 3486.5589999999997
but that doesn't seem to be mutual

3487.68 --> 3503.839
oh hello good servant by the way

3508.799 --> 3512.72
you're being lumped in with other

3510.64 --> 3514.8799999999997
violent construct i don't know what

3512.72 --> 3516.72
violent conspiracy theorists you're even

3514.88 --> 3518.48
talking about the mind of god

3516.72 --> 3520.72
i don't know that many violent

3518.48 --> 3522.96
conspiracy theories i think that

3520.72 --> 3523.9199999999996
most people that are into conspiracy

3522.96 --> 3526.559
theory

3523.92 --> 3530.0
the first thing they learn is that you

3526.559 --> 3533.599
can't get violent

3530.0 --> 3533.599
that's how people get set up

3535.599 --> 3540.079
so i don't know about these violent

3537.44 --> 3545.839
conspiracy theories you're talking about

3540.079 --> 3545.8390000000004
never heard of that

3568.3 --> 3575.119
[Music]

3571.599 --> 3587.839
what got dropped

3575.119 --> 3587.839
how did that happen damn

3620.079 --> 3629.8390000000004
all right

3629.92 --> 3634.319
yeah and by the way tom parker i do pray

3636.799 --> 3640.799
well yeah typically especially when i'm

3638.88 --> 3643.839
nervous about things

3640.799 --> 3643.839
yeah i do

3645.04 --> 3647.2
so

3649.44 --> 3653.76
i like technically i do believe

3652.4 --> 3656.88
currently there is like a

3653.76 --> 3660.0
sub stream of energy

3656.88 --> 3662.559
like outside of rationality right

3660.0 --> 3664.799
outside of the mind structures i have a

3662.559 --> 3669.0400000000004
feeling it will be all right

3664.799 --> 3671.2
also based on reflections of before

3669.04 --> 3673.2
it still makes me nervous though so even

3671.2 --> 3674.0789999999997
though i have kind of a trust that it

3673.2 --> 3677.68
will

3674.079 --> 3679.52
be all right i am still nervous

3677.68 --> 3680.72
like that can't really be taken away

3679.52 --> 3685.839
until i have absolute

3680.72 --> 3685.839
certainty so

3692.0 --> 3696.16
does it even help frank oh yes it does

3697.68 --> 3704.8799999999997
it helps the focus to

3701.52 --> 3706.64
like reconnect instead of worrying about

3704.88 --> 3710.1600000000003
something

3706.64 --> 3710.16
that you're not in control of

3711.28 --> 3717.28
or about getting really nitpicky about

3713.52 --> 3717.28
pre-planning something in your head

3717.44 --> 3724.48
from moving away from that

3720.48 --> 3727.599
basically control freak like actions

3724.48 --> 3728.4
towards just having trust that things

3727.599 --> 3731.52
will work out

3728.4 --> 3734.48
in time and you don't need to

3731.52 --> 3735.359
over focus with your attention which is

3734.48 --> 3739.119
brought forth

3735.359 --> 3743.0389999999998
basically by impulses of fear

3739.119 --> 3743.039
so yeah praying does help

3744.64 --> 3748.0
god here's my prayers

3749.68 --> 3753.68
i'm assuming that whoever needs to hear

3752.96 --> 3756.96
that

3753.68 --> 3756.96
is picking up on it

3760.88 --> 3765.359
then hey if god has a very distinct

3763.52 --> 3767.52
message

3765.359 --> 3770.0789999999997
of something that i would be overlooking

3767.52 --> 3772.24
that is at the core of my problems then

3770.079 --> 3774.48
yeah god might actually kind of speak

3772.24 --> 3774.4799999999996
out

3775.359 --> 3778.88
but for me often i just turn to god

3777.68 --> 3781.1189999999997
rather as

3778.88 --> 3782.0
like a child would step to their mother

3781.119 --> 3783.6800000000003
not because they're

3782.0 --> 3785.68
not in control but just because they

3783.68 --> 3796.0789999999997
kind of need to

3785.68 --> 3798.64
feel like someone is watching over them

3796.079 --> 3801.119
all right i don't need like active

3798.64 --> 3802.4
personal reinsurance from god that

3801.119 --> 3804.2400000000002
things will be all right i'm just

3802.4 --> 3807.92
trusting it

3804.24 --> 3810.0789999999997
i'm just trusting that my senses aren't

3807.92 --> 3813.6800000000003
all lying to me

3810.079 --> 3816.4
that i'm still cohesive and that things

3813.68 --> 3816.3999999999996
will be all right

3820.48 --> 3824.4
oh they're very broke been fasting for

3823.599 --> 3828.799
days

3824.4 --> 3828.799
that sucks dude how did that happen

3830.64 --> 3834.64
i've been kind of fasting myself by the

3832.559 --> 3838.0
way i haven't really eaten

3834.64 --> 3839.839
dinner in three days but with me

3838.0 --> 3842.64
it's because of the nerves and then i

3839.839 --> 3842.64
just eat less

3845.2 --> 3850.24
hopefully at some point the nerves will

3847.359 --> 3853.839
go away and i will probably

3850.24 --> 3853.839
eat some more instead

3861.119 --> 3867.839
how good servant how did that happen how

3864.079 --> 3867.8390000000004
did you get robbed

3887.359 --> 3895.839
you explain no not really

3902.799 --> 3909.839
nope you didn't in chat

3931.599 --> 3935.44
anyway yeah i'm really sorry to hear

3933.28 --> 3938.88
that dude really sucks i

3935.44 --> 3941.2000000000003
can barely imagine that i can't imagine

3938.88 --> 3944.48
that i'm trying not to

3941.2 --> 3945.52
because i know it's terrible i've had my

3944.48 --> 3949.039
bike stolen

3945.52 --> 3952.88
a couple of times some years back

3949.039 --> 3956.3190000000004
and that already really sucked

3952.88 --> 3958.6400000000003
i can't even imagine like

3956.319 --> 3959.52
my own house or my own place getting

3958.64 --> 3965.839
rough

3959.52 --> 3965.839
that's terrible

3974.96 --> 3993.839
okay okay well you don't have to explain

3978.079 --> 3993.8390000000004
it i think i get it

4001.68 --> 4007.839
what the [ __ ] dude

4032.839 --> 4037.119
yeah man

4037.52 --> 4049.839
yeah that just sucks dude i'll be back

4040.96 --> 4049.839
two minutes

4144.839 --> 4147.839
you

4159.839 --> 4161.92
you

4186.839 --> 4189.839
hmm

4200.84 --> 4203.84
whoops

4204.64 --> 4209.84
yeah guns never on our feet i'm a little

4206.88 --> 4213.84
bit confused as well

4209.84 --> 4218.8
like if it can be pointed down

4213.84 --> 4220.64
pinned down who actually did the robbing

4218.8 --> 4223.04
that should you be able to just call

4220.64 --> 4223.04
police

4228.84 --> 4231.84
zoom

4238.32 --> 4242.5599999999995
yeah yeah i know that was yeah the earth

4241.36 --> 4259.839999999999
is freaking flat

4242.56 --> 4259.84
get over it get a freaking life

4268.08 --> 4274.96
do i have membership options

4271.52 --> 4274.96
well not really

4275.92 --> 4282.4800000000005
it's i don't know the membership system

4279.04 --> 4287.12
i had like this idea originally with it

4282.48 --> 4290.48
but i never really kept building on that

4287.12 --> 4293.599999999999
it's just that i i don't beside

4290.48 --> 4296.799999999999
the two-hour show that i do

4293.6 --> 4299.6
i i don't really have any

4296.8 --> 4300.400000000001
big inspiration outside of that to do

4299.6 --> 4302.96
other

4300.4 --> 4303.599999999999
recordings on top of that on a regular

4302.96 --> 4306.2390000000005
basis

4303.6 --> 4307.76
as i originally thought that i could but

4306.239 --> 4309.759999999999
it's just not really

4307.76 --> 4311.76
working out but then again the

4309.76 --> 4315.12
membership system has other

4311.76 --> 4318.320000000001
uses as well so i i

4315.12 --> 4320.8
do i would prefer that people that

4318.32 --> 4322.4
appreciate my shows and what i do that

4320.8 --> 4325.1990000000005
they would

4322.4 --> 4327.36
become a member join even just for the

4325.199 --> 4328.5599999999995
minimum and then at points i will

4327.36 --> 4332.639999999999
perhaps also do

4328.56 --> 4332.64
members only chats

4334.56 --> 4339.120000000001
and maybe even step away from the wrench

4337.6 --> 4342.8
system

4339.12 --> 4343.28
because wrenches kind of typically seem

4342.8 --> 4347.1990000000005
to

4343.28 --> 4349.759999999999
be more of a seduction to kind of

4347.199 --> 4349.759999999999
use it

4350.32 --> 4355.599999999999
politically right or yeah don't use it

4353.52 --> 4358.400000000001
for personal reasons

4355.6 --> 4359.1990000000005
so more than often in recent weeks i've

4358.4 --> 4362.0
just been like

4359.199 --> 4363.44
oh yeah you you timed them out but i

4362.0 --> 4366.96
didn't really want that

4363.44 --> 4369.5199999999995
right so it would be better to basically

4366.96 --> 4371.199
get rid of as much as many wrenches as

4369.52 --> 4373.040000000001
possible and replace it by just

4371.199 --> 4375.919999999999
memberships

4373.04 --> 4375.92
that would be better

4376.08 --> 4380.64
patreon is okay monthly yes yes guns

4378.8 --> 4385.04
have never owned yeah i know

4380.64 --> 4388.88
you were a part of my patreon

4385.04 --> 4388.88
i noticed that thank you very much

4396.0 --> 4401.92
did i confess the earth is flat

4399.679 --> 4405.679
no it's just because of just this stupid

4401.92 --> 4405.679
guy keeps calling me on my phone

4408.56 --> 4413.84
so i told him yeah through the show

4411.199 --> 4413.839999999999
because he knows

4424.84 --> 4427.84
this

4429.76 --> 4433.92
yeah he's probably watching and just

4431.679 --> 4437.52
thought it's funny to

4433.92 --> 4437.52
start harassing me on my phone

4438.239 --> 4441.839999999999
last time i actually heard something

4440.96 --> 4443.92
coming through

4441.84 --> 4445.4400000000005
there was a guy saying the ruth is a

4443.92 --> 4455.84
bull oh

4445.44 --> 4455.839999999999
so special so special

4464.719 --> 4472.0
right tiny wumbo well i do appreciate

4468.56 --> 4472.0
some people with a wrench though

4473.12 --> 4483.84
in here it's just most of the time it's

4476.159 --> 4483.839999999999
not really necessary

4491.52 --> 4494.88
but there's all kinds of weird social

4493.679 --> 4498.4
dynamics that come

4494.88 --> 4501.6
on top with it right a wrench

4498.4 --> 4504.96
so having a wrench will also

4501.6 --> 4508.56
for regular people

4504.96 --> 4511.679
be like a social incentive to

4508.56 --> 4514.2390000000005
not go and disrespect somebody

4511.679 --> 4515.92
as much as they would if they were just

4514.239 --> 4516.718999999999
a regular person in chat because they

4515.92 --> 4518.32
got a wrench

4516.719 --> 4521.04
you don't piss off somebody that has a

4518.32 --> 4522.48
wrench so that's a social function about

4521.04 --> 4525.28
it

4522.48 --> 4527.04
and on the other hand if somebody is

4525.28 --> 4530.48
specifically trying to get

4527.04 --> 4531.92
banned as a troll action then they will

4530.48 --> 4539.839999999999
do exactly the opposite

4531.92 --> 4539.84
instead so see it's just complicated

4553.76 --> 4559.280000000001
all right oh guns of nephron you know i

4556.88 --> 4559.28
think that

4559.44 --> 4562.96
being a devout ball believer and

4561.679 --> 4566.0
defending

4562.96 --> 4569.12
that belief it does in ways kind of like

4566.0 --> 4571.52
mentally damage you but it's not

4569.12 --> 4573.28
right it's not really permanent though

4571.52 --> 4577.360000000001
it's just that it's like this

4573.28 --> 4577.36
cohesion disruption effect

4578.84 --> 4585.92
and when you step away

4582.159 --> 4589.28
from it can be quite painful

4585.92 --> 4591.12
it's a known effect flat earthers have

4589.28 --> 4593.36
a few months of sleepless nights and

4591.12 --> 4596.48
they get

4593.36 --> 4600.639999999999
yeah manic depressive maybe

4596.48 --> 4600.639999999999
they have that tendency and

4601.199 --> 4605.759999999999
because sticking having been in it

4604.239 --> 4609.36
especially if you like really been

4605.76 --> 4612.64
passionate about the globe then

4609.36 --> 4615.04
it really does lay out these webs that

4612.64 --> 4617.679
just disrupt your overall spiritual

4615.04 --> 4617.679
cohesion

4618.48 --> 4622.0
and then if you step out it's like you

4621.52 --> 4624.719
have these

4622.0 --> 4626.64
scars you have to clean out it's not

4624.719 --> 4629.76
permanent necessary but

4626.64 --> 4631.84
the bigger you were into it the more

4629.76 --> 4633.92
you have to kind of like catch up and

4631.84 --> 4635.6
that's exactly a situation that i've

4633.92 --> 4639.84
been in

4635.6 --> 4643.4400000000005
even before i got awakened to flat earth

4639.84 --> 4646.159000000001
because there were phases before that

4643.44 --> 4647.759999999999
when i already got confronted with the

4646.159 --> 4650.08
earth not being a ball

4647.76 --> 4652.2390000000005
or that the information is incorrect and

4650.08 --> 4656.32
still trying to find a way through

4652.239 --> 4660.48
to somehow make it a ball after all

4656.32 --> 4661.759999999999
and that those actions those really wear

4660.48 --> 4664.879999999999
on you

4661.76 --> 4667.76
also make make me feel stupid

4664.88 --> 4669.6
for a reason that i could not explain to

4667.76 --> 4673.84
myself i did not understand

4669.6 --> 4673.84
why when i was going through that

4675.36 --> 4679.199
very bizarre but it wears on you but

4678.08 --> 4682.239
once you

4679.199 --> 4684.5599999999995
once you unleash yourself from those

4682.239 --> 4687.04
false beliefs

4684.56 --> 4689.76
you got you gotta take some time to

4687.04 --> 4689.76
clean it up

4691.52 --> 4696.56
to get real again to become more

4704.84 --> 4707.84
cohesive

4722.88 --> 4729.1990000000005
all right yeah tara 306 look

4726.88 --> 4731.679
the one the discovery that the earth is

4729.199 --> 4733.759999999999
actually flat and not the ball

4731.679 --> 4735.04
yeah you might have gone through that in

4733.76 --> 4736.8
one second

4735.04 --> 4738.4
some people have never thought it was a

4736.8 --> 4742.08
bowl like chocolate satan

4738.4 --> 4745.5199999999995
as he professes but

4742.08 --> 4748.5599999999995
flat earth is not really

4745.52 --> 4751.92
about flat earth it's

4748.56 --> 4754.96
about the minds of people and

4751.92 --> 4756.0
dreams and how they have a tendency to

4754.96 --> 4758.159
latch on to

4756.0 --> 4760.08
dreams even though those dreams dreams

4758.159 --> 4763.28
are flimsy in ways

4760.08 --> 4766.64
they still believe it so flat earth

4763.28 --> 4770.32
overall is much more about

4766.64 --> 4772.96
psychology and how

4770.32 --> 4775.599999999999
yeah how to deal with what the spells

4772.96 --> 4778.96
going down in the world

4775.6 --> 4781.1990000000005
rather than even the mechanics because a

4778.96 --> 4783.28
lot of the mechanics aren't really all

4781.199 --> 4787.04
that worked out

4783.28 --> 4789.04
we got the physics foundations of course

4787.04 --> 4791.199
to have the gas pressure you have to

4789.04 --> 4793.92
have a container

4791.199 --> 4796.4
there's no curvature because of the

4793.92 --> 4800.0
black swan observations

4796.4 --> 4801.44
etc no motion these are physical things

4800.0 --> 4804.0
that we've worked out right

4801.44 --> 4805.36
but beyond that there's not a lot of

4804.0 --> 4808.32
detail because there's still

4805.36 --> 4808.799999999999
uncertainties there's still questions

4808.32 --> 4810.88
that

4808.8 --> 4812.639
kind of with the information available

4810.88 --> 4815.84
can't be fully figured out

4812.639 --> 4818.719
wow at the same time people are still

4815.84 --> 4819.92
trying to gaslight everybody else by

4818.719 --> 4822.96
claiming they do

4819.92 --> 4825.36
know those can be ballers those can be

4822.96 --> 4826.96
people that want to specifically reify

4825.36 --> 4829.599999999999
some kind of a

4826.96 --> 4830.719
shape within the flat realm or even

4829.6 --> 4834.0
concavity

4830.719 --> 4837.92
so people champion a model

4834.0 --> 4840.96
without actually knowing

4837.92 --> 4840.96
everything about it

4843.12 --> 4847.44
i try to do that as little as possible

4845.76 --> 4850.159000000001
so every time i explain about

4847.44 --> 4852.5599999999995
rectangular looping model

4850.159 --> 4853.5199999999995
i explain like how is it established how

4852.56 --> 4856.56
is it what

4853.52 --> 4857.4400000000005
factors determine whether if the flat

4856.56 --> 4860.96
earth realm

4857.44 --> 4863.12
can be rectangular looping how would you

4860.96 --> 4866.159
discover that i'm much more interested

4863.12 --> 4867.679
in that how to actually figure out what

4866.159 --> 4870.239
it is

4867.679 --> 4875.84
because it's not just done once you

4870.239 --> 4875.839999999999
figure out it's flat

4885.44 --> 4890.32
now it's still flat even if you assume

4887.679 --> 4890.32
refraction

4890.639 --> 4903.84
it's just flat

4909.84 --> 4913.6
not gonna figure out much by sitting

4911.76 --> 4917.1990000000005
here every day

4913.6 --> 4920.2390000000005
well i guess that's right

4917.199 --> 4922.48
but at least i figured out on what

4920.239 --> 4924.32
to actually do and this is open

4922.48 --> 4925.678999999999
information it's basically up for the

4924.32 --> 4928.0
grabbler

4925.679 --> 4929.679
it's i've thrown it that much out there

4928.0 --> 4930.32
it's up for the grabber somebody could

4929.679 --> 4935.04
just step

4930.32 --> 4937.12
up take the advice that i've

4935.04 --> 4938.4
given out on how to figure out the

4937.12 --> 4940.32
cosmogeny and then

4938.4 --> 4942.32
[ __ ] claim it completely for

4940.32 --> 4944.08
themselves and then nobody would ever

4942.32 --> 4946.96
have to hear about arwen except

4944.08 --> 4948.48
for that ragey guy on the internet that

4946.96 --> 4951.6
nobody cares about

4948.48 --> 4955.839999999999
they could technically do that

4951.6 --> 4955.84
would totally [ __ ] me up if they did

4956.08 --> 4963.12
right since i've spent so much focus

4959.28 --> 4966.239
on actually doing this

4963.12 --> 4967.84
but yeah this is what i this is what i'm

4966.239 --> 4970.959999999999
doing this is what

4967.84 --> 4970.96
my main concern

4971.44 --> 4978.159
is growing out of this

4975.28 --> 4979.44
growing out of this financially moving

4978.159 --> 4982.4
on

4979.44 --> 4983.599999999999
moving on to maybe get into a position

4982.4 --> 4987.04
where i will

4983.6 --> 4987.4400000000005
engage the world physically more and

4987.04 --> 4989.76
more

4987.44 --> 4991.839999999999
and maybe even get to that point where i

4989.76 --> 4996.0
will start to

4991.84 --> 4999.12
figure out the yeah the cosmogeny

4996.0 --> 5000.08
in the field by maybe establishing what

4999.12 --> 5003.76
the orientation

5000.08 --> 5003.76
of the equator line actually is

5010.8 --> 5017.6
people care about me well some people do

5014.4 --> 5021.28
some people are just i don't know

5017.6 --> 5026.159000000001
very annoyed that yeah as a person

5021.28 --> 5026.159
i do talk a lot about myself i do

5026.8 --> 5029.92
and i've noticed that sometimes i even

5029.199 --> 5031.678999999999
do it

5029.92 --> 5033.4400000000005
when you're not supposed to be doing

5031.679 --> 5037.36
that socially

5033.44 --> 5040.799999999999
and i figure out afterwards like oh [ __ ]

5037.36 --> 5043.44
i made it about me by accident

5040.8 --> 5044.88
just because i wanted to reflect because

5043.44 --> 5046.48
i wanted to cross-reference like

5044.88 --> 5047.12
somebody's explaining something and then

5046.48 --> 5049.28
i'm like

5047.12 --> 5051.599999999999
oh man i've done i've experienced

5049.28 --> 5054.4
something like that too

5051.6 --> 5054.96
because i want to sympathize but then

5054.4 --> 5058.0
often

5054.96 --> 5059.679
it's more like i'm trying to draw the

5058.0 --> 5064.08
attention away

5059.679 --> 5064.08
and i never actively meant to do that

5064.48 --> 5067.5199999999995
right so people might be annoyed by me

5066.88 --> 5070.8
because i do

5067.52 --> 5072.96
talk a lot about myself but i do it not

5070.8 --> 5076.4800000000005
because i think i'm such an

5072.96 --> 5080.56
amazing movie star worthy

5076.48 --> 5083.839999999999
character it's because

5080.56 --> 5085.6
of necessity because i am i've made

5083.84 --> 5088.639
myself into kind of like a

5085.6 --> 5092.88
public psychological project

5088.639 --> 5096.56
and also to prove myself as i'm doing it

5092.88 --> 5096.56
to prove my cohesion

5096.719 --> 5104.719
my integrity and cohesion up close

5100.719 --> 5104.719
beyond what normal people would do

5105.36 --> 5113.839999999999
and so people might actually

5108.4 --> 5113.839999999999
appreciate that

5115.52 --> 5122.8
but yes i do just blabber on sometimes

5119.44 --> 5125.919999999999
about myself over and over again

5122.8 --> 5130.0
because hey i am interested in myself

5125.92 --> 5130.0
also because it's a work in progress

5130.56 --> 5135.4400000000005
and i found that actually working on

5133.36 --> 5139.839999999999
myself and my skills and

5135.44 --> 5142.96
taking it serious yields results

5139.84 --> 5144.159000000001
in contrast to spending all my intention

5142.96 --> 5148.0
and time on

5144.159 --> 5151.92
other things like trying to somehow get

5148.0 --> 5154.96
a job whatever that's not paid off

5151.92 --> 5158.159
at all and i have tried that

5154.96 --> 5158.159
right guys i have

5159.92 --> 5163.6
so dedicated quite some time to trying

5162.719 --> 5167.199
that out

5163.6 --> 5169.84
didn't work this is working

5167.199 --> 5172.159
building myself doing my putting myself

5169.84 --> 5175.4400000000005
down as a public project i think it is

5172.159 --> 5178.4
much more effective

5175.44 --> 5180.32
in my development towards something that

5178.4 --> 5181.92
i want for myself in the future

5180.32 --> 5183.679
and the rest of the world not just

5181.92 --> 5186.96
myself

5183.679 --> 5187.679
but i'm not going to kid myself into

5186.96 --> 5190.2390000000005
thinking that

5187.679 --> 5193.92
i will actually have this massive

5190.239 --> 5193.919999999999
worldwide impact like that

5195.28 --> 5200.32
don't think so i like to imagine it

5197.6 --> 5203.280000000001
sometimes but i don't think really

5200.32 --> 5204.5599999999995
but i do think that by just being me

5203.28 --> 5208.239
being very

5204.56 --> 5208.4800000000005
real me just really unfettered not just

5208.239 --> 5210.879999999999
an

5208.48 --> 5211.759999999999
act to really oh look make it look

5210.88 --> 5213.92
really real now

5211.76 --> 5215.1990000000005
this is just really freaking me it

5213.92 --> 5218.08
really is

5215.199 --> 5218.638999999999
it really is me this is not an act in

5218.08 --> 5223.679
any

5218.639 --> 5226.88
form the only act

5223.679 --> 5230.56
there is is me putting

5226.88 --> 5230.56
effort in my communication

5234.0 --> 5241.6
but is that an act it's just

5237.44 --> 5245.36
doing something more serious but

5241.6 --> 5253.84
anyway i'm wandering off into

5245.36 --> 5253.839999999999
nowhere with this subject

5261.52 --> 5269.360000000001
being wrong about the shape of the earth

5266.08 --> 5269.36
oh we need francine

5272.96 --> 5278.2390000000005
look if you want it to be a ball it can

5276.0 --> 5280.0
be a ball for you you know you can live

5278.239 --> 5283.28
in ball world you know there's still

5280.0 --> 5286.4
plenty of same ball safe spaces

5283.28 --> 5289.28
plenty of that around so if you

5286.4 --> 5290.638999999999
really want the earth to actually be a

5289.28 --> 5292.639
ball

5290.639 --> 5294.4800000000005
why don't you just go away and leave the

5292.639 --> 5296.32
flat earthers alone

5294.48 --> 5298.879999999999
because you're not going to find the

5296.32 --> 5302.0
proof the proofs

5298.88 --> 5302.8
that the earth is a ball at flat

5302.0 --> 5304.8
earthers

5302.8 --> 5306.320000000001
because we've revealed there isn't any

5304.8 --> 5308.719
so if you want to believe

5306.32 --> 5312.48
there is you're going to have to stick

5308.719 --> 5312.4800000000005
to baller safe spaces

5313.36 --> 5316.5599999999995
right where people aren't going to tell

5315.199 --> 5318.719
you the earth is not a ball

5316.56 --> 5320.719
it's actually flat right you have to

5318.719 --> 5321.52
find those spaces if that is what you

5320.719 --> 5324.8
want if you

5321.52 --> 5326.400000000001
really want to believe that then you

5324.8 --> 5329.6
should

5326.4 --> 5333.28
not just

5329.6 --> 5334.639
keep following and going after flat

5333.28 --> 5337.04
earthers all of the time why don't you

5334.639 --> 5338.639
just leave him alone

5337.04 --> 5341.12
if you just want the earth to be a ball

5338.639 --> 5341.679
then go to places where the earth is a

5341.12 --> 5344.88
ball

5341.679 --> 5344.88
and just enjoy that

5345.679 --> 5349.679
yeah you can think the flat earth is

5347.76 --> 5353.1990000000005
imaginary you can think that every

5349.679 --> 5353.1990000000005
argument ever uttered

5353.52 --> 5356.88
all the housekeeping questions it's just

5355.6 --> 5359.76
imaginary yes

5356.88 --> 5360.639
every word is imaginary it's all

5359.76 --> 5363.4400000000005
imagined

5360.639 --> 5364.639
everything there is no shape of the

5363.44 --> 5366.4
earth

5364.639 --> 5368.96
it's just whatever the [ __ ] you want it

5366.4 --> 5372.4
to be enjoy

5368.96 --> 5375.52
and stop nagging people

5372.4 --> 5376.879999999999
about what you want to physically prove

5375.52 --> 5392.4800000000005
even though it's blatantly being

5376.88 --> 5394.8
disproven stop it

5392.48 --> 5394.799999999999
okay

5399.59 --> 5402.669
[Music]

5404.96 --> 5407.84
never heard of them

5409.6 --> 5413.1990000000005
might be interesting violin

5415.44 --> 5419.599999999999
how do you know seven people do you even

5417.679 --> 5420.08
know there is seven billion people on

5419.6 --> 5423.4400000000005
earth

5420.08 --> 5425.6
indifference did you count on yourself

5423.44 --> 5429.12
you're just blabbering nonsense i don't

5425.6 --> 5434.2390000000005
care for your religious celery

5429.12 --> 5435.599999999999
get it i don't care what you believe you

5434.239 --> 5439.44
saying it in my chat

5435.6 --> 5439.4400000000005
is not going to make it real

5439.76 --> 5443.360000000001
if you want your earth to be a ball and

5442.32 --> 5445.599999999999
you want to believe

5443.36 --> 5447.44
flat earthers don't really exist and

5445.6 --> 5450.2390000000005
everybody believes it's a ball and it

5447.44 --> 5453.44
was always a ball forever and ever

5450.239 --> 5455.12
until the sun explodes or something

5453.44 --> 5462.799999999999
whatever

5455.12 --> 5465.5199999999995
then just believe that stop whining

5462.8 --> 5466.96
yeah it is a belief it is a ball earth

5465.52 --> 5469.6
is a belief because you don't have

5466.96 --> 5473.04
physical evidence

5469.6 --> 5478.2390000000005
right the horizon that we see

5473.04 --> 5482.08
out there is not a sphere edge

5478.239 --> 5484.08
you're breathing which means

5482.08 --> 5485.5199999999995
it's not an endless space right next to

5484.08 --> 5489.36
the gas pressure here

5485.52 --> 5492.96
at earth's surface yeah

5489.36 --> 5496.719
and there is no coriolis deviation which

5492.96 --> 5496.719
means that the earth is not spinning

5497.44 --> 5504.96
right oh

5500.8 --> 5508.56
start chanting start chanting for me

5504.96 --> 5511.92
oh yeah the spear has no edge yeah

5508.56 --> 5514.56
the spheres have edges

5511.92 --> 5516.0
spheres absolutely have edges it's just

5514.56 --> 5519.280000000001
that the edge

5516.0 --> 5519.84
is not a geometric type of edge it's

5519.28 --> 5523.12
still an

5519.84 --> 5526.719
edge though it's an edge within vision

5523.12 --> 5529.04
yeah that's the edge of the sphere

5526.719 --> 5532.32
edges sphere edges do do i need to say

5529.04 --> 5535.04
it a couple of thousand more times

5532.32 --> 5536.159
i i dedicated an entire freaking show to

5535.04 --> 5539.36
it

5536.159 --> 5541.5199999999995
but i guess that you already forgotten

5539.36 --> 5541.92
that part since i mentioned yesterday

5541.52 --> 5545.360000000001
how

5541.92 --> 5548.4
ballers are actually clinically demented

5545.36 --> 5549.5199999999995
right you commented to it in my in my

5548.4 --> 5552.0
comment section

5549.52 --> 5552.88
of the show yesterday india france yeah

5552.0 --> 5558.32
you are

5552.88 --> 5558.32
clinically demented you are provably so

5558.4 --> 5561.839999999999
you're proving it again

5565.92 --> 5569.119
[Music]

5572.62 --> 5577.22
[Music]

5579.36 --> 5584.32
no they don't you're a liar

5582.719 --> 5588.0
or you simply don't know what the [ __ ]

5584.32 --> 5590.32
you're talking about

5588.0 --> 5592.08
and you just heard a stupid story

5590.32 --> 5595.92
nothing

5592.08 --> 5603.84
corrects for choreos in the world

5595.92 --> 5603.84
nothing does

5609.04 --> 5612.159
hey steamy traveler

5612.239 --> 5615.44
yeah i explained some of that earlier

5614.159 --> 5618.638999999999
today

5615.44 --> 5622.08
it didn't exactly go as i had hoped

5618.639 --> 5625.36
so i'm still working on

5622.08 --> 5625.36
getting legal defense

5627.6 --> 5632.96
i i don't really want to repeat the

5630.4 --> 5632.96
whole thing

5641.36 --> 5648.239
70 increase in squirting

5645.84 --> 5659.84
well yesterday was already pretty strong

5648.239 --> 5659.839999999999
ares 106.

5662.159 --> 5666.719
what i didn't want you here did i say

5665.52 --> 5669.6
that

5666.719 --> 5672.88
no i'm i'm fine with ballers here it's

5669.6 --> 5675.280000000001
just that every time you start the chant

5672.88 --> 5676.56
you say there is no proof or flat earth

5675.28 --> 5680.0
that's just when you

5676.56 --> 5687.84
show yourself to be demented that's all

5680.0 --> 5687.84
just reminding you of the reality

5692.4 --> 5696.5599999999995
what psychiatric qualifications do you

5694.719 --> 5701.84
have i'm a layman

5696.56 --> 5701.84
i got a lifetime experience

5702.96 --> 5710.0
right i don't need a freaking paper

5706.56 --> 5714.159000000001
or some stamp somewhere

5710.0 --> 5714.96
to literally hand over the raw data the

5714.159 --> 5718.638999999999
information

5714.96 --> 5720.88
as it is roll out here put together a

5718.639 --> 5724.2390000000005
case

5720.88 --> 5726.56
and then yeah see see what others

5724.239 --> 5727.44
say about it just the technical facts

5726.56 --> 5731.119000000001
you know you

5727.44 --> 5734.239
i could even take out the words

5731.119 --> 5737.36
certain type of words

5734.239 --> 5741.04
concerning what it's about to

5737.36 --> 5742.96
mask it just take out the literal words

5741.04 --> 5744.88
and replace it with something very

5742.96 --> 5749.119
similar

5744.88 --> 5752.159000000001
that could work as well just to show

5749.119 --> 5752.88
the delusion and not so much the subject

5752.159 --> 5755.839999999999
which might

5752.88 --> 5756.4800000000005
trigger some analyst right to get that

5755.84 --> 5761.4400000000005
trigger

5756.48 --> 5764.959999999999
of the analyst of what is being in being

5761.44 --> 5766.799999999999
figured out being analyzed to prevent

5764.96 --> 5768.719
them from triggering

5766.8 --> 5770.56
from that subject and then they might

5768.719 --> 5772.639
obstruct or get in the way or

5770.56 --> 5774.2390000000005
start saying oh this is a this is

5772.639 --> 5778.0
abominable or whatever

5774.239 --> 5780.48
just make it technical yeah if i present

5778.0 --> 5781.92
everything you've been doing i could

5780.48 --> 5784.5599999999995
probably

5781.92 --> 5786.4
get official psychiatrists and

5784.56 --> 5789.6
psychologists

5786.4 --> 5791.679
to yeah to the fact

5789.6 --> 5793.92
that you are clinically demented and

5791.679 --> 5799.84
that you're proving that

5793.92 --> 5799.84
by your actions

5813.84 --> 5819.679
right and also again don't forget

5817.44 --> 5821.04
yeah don't forget i know you will forget

5819.679 --> 5824.56
because you literally

5821.04 --> 5826.0
forget everything everything you forget

5824.56 --> 5828.719
it's what you get when you're clinically

5826.0 --> 5830.48
demented right don't forget not even 50

5828.719 --> 5833.6
minutes ago

5830.48 --> 5834.0
i gave you a very good tip it's like if

5833.6 --> 5836.88
you

5834.0 --> 5839.04
really want the earth to be a ball then

5836.88 --> 5841.84
just believe the earth is a ball

5839.04 --> 5843.6
get out there there's plenty of places

5841.84 --> 5846.96
that'll tell you the earth is a ball

5843.6 --> 5850.320000000001
show you beautiful ball cgi tell you

5846.96 --> 5853.44
tell you universe outer space stories

5850.32 --> 5856.639
you can just enjoy that but no

5853.44 --> 5860.32
instead you have to be here and

5856.639 --> 5863.4400000000005
double speak all day long

5860.32 --> 5864.88
about how the earth is above its bo is

5863.44 --> 5867.44
no proof of flat earth

5864.88 --> 5868.08
why don't you leave me alone while i

5867.44 --> 5871.5199999999995
stalk

5868.08 --> 5875.119
you by coming back every day

5871.52 --> 5875.119000000001
and double speaking nonsense

5875.52 --> 5878.8
is it what you that's what you're what

5877.199 --> 5883.04
you're doing coming back

5878.8 --> 5887.360000000001
every day and just don't speak nonsense

5883.04 --> 5887.36
that makes you kind of clinically

5894.84 --> 5901.04
demented

5897.36 --> 5903.5199999999995
yeah because of the double speak

5901.04 --> 5905.36
it kind of is talking you know a stalker

5903.52 --> 5907.1990000000005
is somebody who constantly gets in

5905.36 --> 5911.92
somebody's way

5907.199 --> 5915.28
without proper communication harassing

5911.92 --> 5918.32
acting erratic

5915.28 --> 5919.599999999999
right that's what a stalker does stalker

5918.32 --> 5921.92
doesn't just like

5919.6 --> 5925.04
constantly hang around and is helpful

5921.92 --> 5927.4400000000005
and actually comforts the person and

5925.04 --> 5929.6
maybe gets no a stalker keeps their

5927.44 --> 5931.44
social distance in a way

5929.6 --> 5933.6
that's the weird thing about stalkers

5931.44 --> 5936.0
they obsess over somebody but they don't

5933.6 --> 5937.4400000000005
connect to that somebody

5936.0 --> 5939.52
right they just start to behave

5937.44 --> 5942.159
erratically

5939.52 --> 5943.92
just very viscerally like oh i want you

5942.159 --> 5946.239
to know i am here

5943.92 --> 5947.6
for no good reason other than that

5946.239 --> 5950.5599999999995
visceral

5947.6 --> 5951.119000000001
obsession right that's very much what

5950.56 --> 5953.92
you guys

5951.119 --> 5955.759999999999
are behaving like the ballers that

5953.92 --> 5956.4
constantly double speak about how i was

5955.76 --> 5959.52
their nose

5956.4 --> 5962.32
there's no proof of flat earth uh the

5959.52 --> 5962.8
nine billion people think the earth is a

5962.32 --> 5965.599999999999
ball

5962.8 --> 5966.0
blah blah blah blah all that yeah coming

5965.6 --> 5970.0
back

5966.0 --> 5973.84
every day that is kind of like a stalker

5970.0 --> 5976.96
because why are you here

5973.84 --> 5977.6
to say that constantly if the earth is a

5976.96 --> 5980.8
ball

5977.6 --> 5982.88
it shouldn't matter what are you

5980.8 --> 5984.8
bothering somebody that's going to be

5982.88 --> 5987.6
like

5984.8 --> 5989.28
whatever a cube earther what if there

5987.6 --> 5991.360000000001
was a cube earther out there

5989.28 --> 5993.119
who for some reason had a model that the

5991.36 --> 5995.119
earth was a cube are you going to knack

5993.119 --> 5996.88
them all day long like how dare you say

5995.119 --> 5997.36
the earth is a cube it's a bow it's a

5996.88 --> 6002.08
ball

5997.36 --> 6002.08
it's not a cube you're gonna do that

6004.0 --> 6008.719
or you're not gonna do that because well

6006.639 --> 6010.56
the earth being a cube is maybe even

6008.719 --> 6012.719
more ridiculous than the earth being a

6010.56 --> 6016.159000000001
ball

6012.719 --> 6019.28
could it be right

6016.159 --> 6023.599999999999
so you coming here

6019.28 --> 6026.719
double speaking like a demented zealot

6023.6 --> 6029.92
on a daily basis kind of proves that the

6026.719 --> 6031.119
earth is actually flat that the evidence

6029.92 --> 6034.4
is overwhelming

6031.119 --> 6036.719
and that you're completely incapable

6034.4 --> 6037.679
of dealing with that so you have to

6036.719 --> 6040.32
double speak

6037.679 --> 6042.08
in the face of it like you're literally

6040.32 --> 6043.759999999999
facing the devil and you're trying to

6042.08 --> 6046.719
fend it off

6043.76 --> 6047.04
by chanting what you believe in even

6046.719 --> 6049.92
though

6047.04 --> 6052.239
you have been encountered you have

6049.92 --> 6054.4
encountered the disproof of it

6052.239 --> 6055.678999999999
you ignore it because that's just

6054.4 --> 6058.48
seduction it's

6055.679 --> 6059.36
seduction of the freaking truth the

6058.48 --> 6062.239
freaking truth

6059.36 --> 6064.639
trying to seep into your consciousness

6062.239 --> 6067.839999999999
which you know will disrupt

6064.639 --> 6069.84
the image the image of the ball the

6067.84 --> 6073.119000000001
image of the beast

6069.84 --> 6074.639
an image the imagination the dream that

6073.119 --> 6078.159
you're stuck in you know

6074.639 --> 6079.84
if that truth that technical truth the

6078.159 --> 6082.879999999999
criticism

6079.84 --> 6084.719
the mechanics that seeps in is going to

6082.88 --> 6087.04
disrupt your dream so you will

6084.719 --> 6088.32
literally just dement yourself

6087.04 --> 6091.6
instinctually

6088.32 --> 6093.92
and start double speaking nonsense lies

6091.6 --> 6096.4800000000005
that are so blatantly obviously

6093.92 --> 6098.8
incorrect

6096.48 --> 6100.718999999999
they are just effectively lies and

6098.8 --> 6103.6
you'll blurt it out

6100.719 --> 6105.44
like somebody that is demented and

6103.6 --> 6107.84
you'll do it every day come back every

6105.44 --> 6107.839999999999
day

6123.84 --> 6128.159000000001

6378.8 --> 6387.84

huh okay guns have never run around b

6395.119 --> 6401.839999999999
that's fascinating

6396.88 --> 6401.84
where is devon's island

6402.4 --> 6415.839999999999
i didn't know there was such certainty

6404.4 --> 6415.839999999999
about it

6422.4 --> 6426.719
i'm surprised i put up with gunzo well i

6424.8 --> 6427.04
don't always put up with him tom parker

6426.719 --> 6430.56
but

6427.04 --> 6433.92
my chat these days yeah unfortunately

6430.56 --> 6438.159000000001
maybe is a lot more baller written

6433.92 --> 6438.159
riddled i kind of have to

6438.56 --> 6442.080000000001
because at least they get a conversation

6441.44 --> 6446.48
rolling

6442.08 --> 6448.5599999999995
and hey if there is no technical thing

6446.48 --> 6451.919999999999
people want me to explain or anything

6448.56 --> 6454.2390000000005
i'll just go back and forth with glovers

6451.92 --> 6454.2390000000005
you know

6455.44 --> 6459.199
and at least i got it like a persistent

6458.159 --> 6463.119
behavior

6459.199 --> 6465.5199999999995
out of it just i don't mind globers

6463.119 --> 6467.199
it's just that i will be very honest

6465.52 --> 6470.56
about it

6467.199 --> 6472.719
and will be very psychoanalytical about

6470.56 --> 6472.719
it

6476.4 --> 6481.599999999999
but other than that i i'm just

6479.6 --> 6482.88
recognizing it for what it is it's just

6481.6 --> 6485.92
a religious belief

6482.88 --> 6489.28
very persistent it's a religious belief

6485.92 --> 6492.56
of an occult belief that is a belief

6489.28 --> 6496.159
a religion that doesn't actually

6492.56 --> 6498.639
let you know it's a religion

6496.159 --> 6500.32
specifically disclaimed that and that's

6498.639 --> 6501.92
part of the double thing because it is a

6500.32 --> 6504.239
double thing religion

6501.92 --> 6505.36
it's a religion where you are constantly

6504.239 --> 6508.5599999999995
fooling yourself

6505.36 --> 6513.839999999999
into believing the dream

6508.56 --> 6513.84
that it suggests and that is it

6517.28 --> 6526.719
right okay tiny one we'll see you later

6519.199 --> 6530.879999999999
thanks for popping by

6526.719 --> 6530.88
hello by the way orochimaru

6531.76 --> 6536.159000000001
this evening of a gradient is a

6533.28 --> 6536.159
container indeed

6537.04 --> 6541.84
first you got the gas pressure then you

6538.88 --> 6541.84
get the gradient

6542.639 --> 6548.32
rather first you get the container then

6544.56 --> 6548.320000000001
you get gas pressure and then you get a

6552.84 --> 6555.84
gradient

6574.08 --> 6583.5199999999995
now explain the gradient why

6578.08 --> 6586.08
isn't it obvious why there is a gradient

6583.52 --> 6589.4400000000005
why are there gradients with things it's

6586.08 --> 6591.84
because of relative density

6589.44 --> 6593.119
it's not because of dynamic system the

6591.84 --> 6596.8
dynamic system

6593.119 --> 6600.719
only adds to the gradation

6596.8 --> 6600.719
but there would be a gradient anyway

6604.4 --> 6608.32
because relative density is just the

6606.32 --> 6613.199
less dense split up

6608.32 --> 6616.5599999999995
from the dancer they divide

6613.199 --> 6619.678999999999
and that includes gas

6616.56 --> 6620.080000000001
it just also mixes up with everything so

6619.679 --> 6623.36
it's

6620.08 --> 6626.4
kind of a combined effect of a mash

6623.36 --> 6639.61
the less dense eventually do

6626.4 --> 6642.79
stack up on top on average

6639.61 --> 6642.79
[Music]

6650.84 --> 6653.84
good

6658.32 --> 6662.719
in fact can be the least dense thing

6660.48 --> 6667.839999999999
possible

6662.719 --> 6667.84
what kind of a question is that

6680.639 --> 6684.400000000001
yeah that's that's really cute howard

6684.0 --> 6687.44
moore

6684.4 --> 6688.96
indeed you could definitely say that a

6687.44 --> 6692.719
gradient is a force

6688.96 --> 6694.719
pulling down yeah it's just not

6692.719 --> 6696.119
gravity pulling down it's actually the

6694.719 --> 6700.0
relative density

6696.119 --> 6703.28
disequilibrium force that indeed

6700.0 --> 6706.4
forces the denser things

6703.28 --> 6709.599
in the air down through the dis

6706.4 --> 6712.96
equilibrium force it's a force

6709.599 --> 6716.32
provable measurable force

6712.96 --> 6720.4
absolutely and the less density

6716.32 --> 6724.639
are forced with a force measurable force

6720.4 --> 6726.5599999999995
up yeah because we got a force

6724.639 --> 6728.96
we gotta force the relative density

6726.56 --> 6730.639
theory you don't

6728.96 --> 6736.4
you don't even know what freaking

6730.639 --> 6738.56
gravity is

6736.4 --> 6739.679
you don't have gravity it doesn't do

6738.56 --> 6741.84
anything

6739.679 --> 6743.92
you don't know what it does you only

6741.84 --> 6747.1990000000005
heard a bunch of stories

6743.92 --> 6750.88
left in the dark as to what it really is

6747.199 --> 6754.4
and then you

6750.88 --> 6756.32
i guess out of boredom start to

6754.4 --> 6758.4
imagine how it's supposed to work

6756.32 --> 6760.5599999999995
without much cohesion and when you try

6758.4 --> 6763.5199999999995
to confirm it it turns out you don't

6760.56 --> 6764.0
you don't have anything because people

6763.52 --> 6766.159000000001
don't know

6764.0 --> 6768.239
what gravity is because it isn't

6766.159 --> 6771.119
anything it doesn't exist

6768.239 --> 6773.199
it never did it's a concept it's a

6771.119 --> 6776.0
mechanism

6773.199 --> 6778.08
it's a calculation mechanism that can be

6776.0 --> 6781.44
very helpful

6778.08 --> 6784.88
unfortunately though nothing about it is

6781.44 --> 6784.879999999999
physically real

6786.239 --> 6793.839999999999
how about that

6810.4 --> 6821.839999999999
a more colored

6828.4 --> 6833.759999999999
right so yeah it's very tough again

6831.599 --> 6834.8
because ballers look the problem with

6833.76 --> 6838.08
ballers is

6834.8 --> 6840.08
is they are so fanatical about trying to

6838.08 --> 6841.92
virtually win they'll literally

6840.08 --> 6843.84
wreck their entire understanding of

6841.92 --> 6848.08
everything

6843.84 --> 6850.32
just to seemingly win

6848.08 --> 6851.44
seemingly because there is no actual win

6850.32 --> 6854.88
in any of it

6851.44 --> 6857.678999999999
right but yeah yeah the gradient

6854.88 --> 6858.719
yeah it's caused by a force it's a force

6857.679 --> 6861.599
the force

6858.719 --> 6862.639
you would like to be gravity it isn't

6861.599 --> 6864.88
though

6862.639 --> 6866.2390000000005
because it's relative density this

6864.88 --> 6868.719
equilibrium force

6866.239 --> 6870.32
that is present causes the passive

6868.719 --> 6873.199
displacement forces

6870.32 --> 6874.32
right causes the division between the

6873.199 --> 6877.5199999999995
dense

6874.32 --> 6880.5599999999995
and the less dense yeah

6877.52 --> 6881.360000000001
that's actual force the real force in

6880.56 --> 6883.4400000000005
the world

6881.36 --> 6885.119
that is palpable and scientifically

6883.44 --> 6888.239
provable real

6885.119 --> 6891.759999999999
not fictional not imaginary not just

6888.239 --> 6895.119
existing in a bunch of calculations

6891.76 --> 6898.719
yeah it's real and it does indeed

6895.119 --> 6901.759999999999
split things up and cause a gradient

6898.719 --> 6904.2390000000005
it does not gravity though

6901.76 --> 6905.4400000000005
because gravity is a concept and there

6904.239 --> 6908.4
is no proof

6905.44 --> 6910.48
for gravity there isn't any it's just a

6908.4 --> 6913.759999999999
bunch of stories

6910.48 --> 6914.959999999999
sloppily smacked together trying to

6913.76 --> 6918.159000000001
cover

6914.96 --> 6920.4
cover over that is just relative density

6918.159 --> 6922.239
it's just relative density

6920.4 --> 6925.44
scientifically provable and that

6922.239 --> 6929.28
is it that is it there is nothing else

6925.44 --> 6930.638999999999
there's just that you can speculate all

6929.28 --> 6934.4
day as to

6930.639 --> 6947.84
why why why yeah i don't care

6934.4 --> 6947.839999999999
why just know how what

6952.4 --> 6956.159
see see how is a bobbington that's why i

6955.679 --> 6959.28
did it

6956.159 --> 6962.719
it's for people like andy franson

6959.28 --> 6965.92
see because he is an expert at

6962.719 --> 6968.639
hearing out a complete full

6965.92 --> 6970.159
explanation about something then

6968.639 --> 6973.52
immediately forgetting

6970.159 --> 6975.5199999999995
and asserting the absolute nonsensical

6973.52 --> 6979.679
opposite

6975.52 --> 6979.679
because he's a double speaking fundy

6979.76 --> 6984.08
and he can't hear the truth so he has to

6982.159 --> 6989.199
erase it and replace it

6984.08 --> 6992.8
again with his dream based nonsense

6989.199 --> 6995.44
has to do it see has to make gravity

6992.8 --> 6996.2390000000005
real because in the dream gravity is

6995.44 --> 7000.08
real so it

6996.239 --> 7000.08
must be reified

7000.159 --> 7007.04
it's really a sad state of affairs

7003.84 --> 7009.28
to to compulsively have to do such a

7007.04 --> 7009.28
thing

7011.76 --> 7017.1990000000005
see and i would oh write down ready why

7014.239 --> 7019.04
why because somebody cannot say

7017.199 --> 7020.96
that there simply isn't any more

7019.04 --> 7023.119
information you can't handle that

7020.96 --> 7025.04
because now you're a little kid again

7023.119 --> 7028.08
that never got those answers again

7025.04 --> 7031.36
wait wait this is not fair

7028.08 --> 7035.199
why can't i no not why not

7031.36 --> 7036.719
why why why why wine wine wine wine wire

7035.199 --> 7039.839999999999
whine all day long

7036.719 --> 7043.119
don't give a [ __ ] you can't know why

7039.84 --> 7046.719
can just know how it works

7043.119 --> 7050.08
how it works certainty

7046.719 --> 7053.44
absolute confirmable repeatable

7050.08 --> 7059.84
certainty and not why why why

7053.44 --> 7062.159
why whining all day long how about that

7059.84 --> 7063.76
right so i'm gonna round out the show so

7062.159 --> 7066.879999999999
thanks everyone for coming

7063.76 --> 7068.320000000001
i hope you like the show it's a little

7066.88 --> 7071.599
slow at first

7068.32 --> 7075.599
but things got kind of amusing so

7071.599 --> 7077.84
if you did actually like the show

7075.599 --> 7079.679
then please don't forget to rogan's it

7077.84 --> 7081.360000000001

join button that would be much

7099.52 --> 7102.719
appreciated

please do keep it coming i do need

7102.719 --> 7105.92
support

7103.76 --> 7107.280000000001
and if things are gonna grow out of

7105.92 --> 7110.4
control and i

7107.28 --> 7113.759999999999
assume they won't but they could then

7110.4 --> 7117.679
i'm gonna need a lot of help

7113.76 --> 7118.56
please keep it coming anyway i will be

7117.679 --> 7121.599
back tomorrow

7118.56 --> 7123.04
flat earth early bird number 815 on

7121.599 --> 7123.4400000000005
wednesday and i'm going to join the

7123.04 --> 7126.159
flare

7123.44 --> 7126.48
debates which should start up any minute

7126.159 --> 7129.199
now

7126.48 --> 7131.839999999999
over at nathan oakley's hope to see you

7129.199 --> 7131.839999999999
there in chat

7132.32 --> 7144.11
until the next video keep it flat

7142.85 --> 7144.85
[Music]

7144.11 --> 7154.839999999999
[Applause]

7144.85 --> 7157.120000000001
