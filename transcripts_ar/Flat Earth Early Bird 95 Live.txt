0.83 --> 4.93
died on me out of nothing

6.41 --> 9.52
stop seeing this

14.39 --> 17.69
seeing this

22.779 --> 25.83
seeing this

27.27 --> 39.6
okay yeah Internet died on me seeing

31.71 --> 42.510000000000005
that yeah last time that happened I got

39.6 --> 48.660000000000004
really pissed off anyway very typical

42.51 --> 51.089999999999996
very difficult I don't know what else

48.66 --> 54.31999999999999
you missed probably a big chunk I

51.09 --> 59.940000000000005
noticed some really weird stuff

54.32 --> 65.7
yesterday with my very long hangout with

59.94 --> 70.83
the even or only sheep oh can see there

65.7 --> 76.65
were like several seconds just cut out

70.83 --> 78.27
of it just in certain spots just caught

76.65 --> 81.229
out of the video I've never seen

78.27 --> 88.02
anything like that it's just broken off

81.229 --> 90.21
like seconds were erased I've never seen

88.02 --> 92.1
that with anyone else you know you get

90.21 --> 94.07
to see like Oh internet connection

92.1 --> 96.78
disruption earth goes down then

94.07 --> 99.14899999999999
continues but these were like in the

96.78 --> 101.159
middle of conversations like half a

99.149 --> 103.82900000000001
second or something was just missing and

101.159 --> 105.299
I never seen that before that was really

103.829 --> 110.939
weird I don't know if you guys have seen

105.299 --> 113.35900000000001
that just doesn't make any sense to me

110.939 --> 113.359
really

144.55 --> 151.18
yeah anyway yeah the connection was just

148.03 --> 153.64000000000001
lost and I noticed it quite late so I

151.18 --> 155.89000000000001
had just talked and stuff and now I

153.64 --> 157.89999999999998
don't need that that's the perfect way

155.89 --> 159.97
to make me forget because now there's

157.9 --> 164.44
something missing I don't know what it

159.97 --> 169.32999999999998
is I can get it back so I completely

164.44 --> 175.95
lost track like being interrupted from

169.33 --> 175.95000000000002
the outside just freaking great

180.84 --> 188.94
so what was the last thing I was talking

184.08 --> 191.63000000000002
about before I got interrupted anybody

188.94 --> 191.63
can help me with that

229.34 --> 232.67000000000002
anyway it's

233.55 --> 238.55
I guess it's kind of a continuation of

236.13 --> 245.34
the whole path thing my dad helped me

238.55 --> 246.75
again his insights a lot and yeah it's

245.34 --> 248.97
not like the first time he's been

246.75 --> 253.53
telling me this he's been telling me

248.97 --> 258.12
this in the last 20 years every time I

253.53 --> 260.37
feel really upset on desperate or

258.12 --> 262.32
something he always tells me the same

260.37 --> 264.36
[ __ ] and every time like yeah yeah yeah

262.32 --> 269.37
that's what you do I'm doing it my way

264.36 --> 273.12
and this time it's like holy [ __ ] he's

269.37 --> 275.76
literally been saying exactly the same

273.12 --> 280.74
thing over and over and over and over

275.76 --> 285.06
again not even giving variations on it

280.74 --> 286.95
over the years and maybe he was right

285.06 --> 289.35
after all my god

286.95 --> 292.83
now that's feeling like being stepped on

289.35 --> 297.84000000000003
the dick okay that makes me feel really

292.83 --> 302.21
annoyingly stupid and just baffles me

297.84 --> 307.26
like okay why didn't I get this before

302.21 --> 309.62
why did I waste so much time making this

307.26 --> 309.62
mistake

314.33 --> 318.01
and yeah that refers to

319.7 --> 326.86
trying to throw your feelings your will

323.57 --> 332.84
driven by your feelings into the world

326.86 --> 337.84000000000003
expecting something better yeah it's in

332.84 --> 337.84
a way caring and acting upon it what

341.91 --> 349.78000000000003
yeah maybe

344.53 --> 352.21
yeah it just doesn't work and in it's

349.78 --> 355.78
very odd because in a way it again feels

352.21 --> 358.59999999999997
like walking that path and as I've been

355.78 --> 361.21
saying like every time you the light

358.6 --> 364.36
grows brighter the shadows try to find

361.21 --> 368.60999999999996
their way in and maybe they are now

364.36 --> 368.61
doing that through this

371.27 --> 377.15
they're they're like trying to punish me

374.78 --> 381.28999999999996
for caring

377.15 --> 384.94
that's messed up that feels really

381.29 --> 384.94
messed up I can tell you

391.33 --> 397.88
right

393.68 --> 401.93
but not really advice it's just talking

397.88 --> 404.99
through this this process trying to

401.93 --> 408.32
explain what I'm going through what I've

404.99 --> 410.419
been seeing I think I mentioned dream a

408.32 --> 412.90999999999997
little bit but I didn't go into detail

410.419 --> 415.07
about it I don't know it's I think that

412.91 --> 417.55
yeah there's nothing really big you've

415.07 --> 417.55
missing

421.34 --> 428.9
but this dream was so typical because it

424.97 --> 430.67
was just a typical dream again see

428.9 --> 434.45
pretty clear emember it pretty clearly

430.67 --> 438.02000000000004
that's not but it's been happening this

434.45 --> 441.46999999999997
type of dream before happens with phases

438.02 --> 445.12
it's not dark world although it's almost

441.47 --> 451.22
half dark world it's a bit blurry and

445.12 --> 453.38
it's just a dream very obviously so but

451.22 --> 455.21000000000004
still the feelings are the feelings the

453.38 --> 458.0
care is to care and it was exactly a

455.21 --> 461.57
reflection of this what I'm actually

458.0 --> 464.21
trying to explain because it was weird

461.57 --> 466.52
it was yeah I can even draw it out I

464.21 --> 474.32
remember it visually exactly what it was

466.52 --> 478.37
like it was like a big old swimming pool

474.32 --> 481.13
like old was wasn't maintained nor

478.37 --> 483.17
cleaned it was full of water but

481.13 --> 487.09
everything would look black probably

483.17 --> 492.34000000000003
because of algae and yeah dust mud

487.09 --> 494.529
having been all over it and there were

492.34 --> 497.55899999999997
pipes

494.529 --> 501.699
like industrial pipes running straight

497.559 --> 505.02900000000005
across it in the mill I I never really

501.699 --> 510.459
realized why didn't even at first notice

505.029 --> 513.55
they were there and there was this wall

510.459 --> 515.7090000000001
next to it of which the top I couldn't

513.55 --> 519.2189999999999
see wasn't straight up all more like a

515.709 --> 524.4699999999999
rocky surface with a lot of dirt on it

519.219 --> 528.73
and a very small very unstable looking

524.47 --> 532.149
path very tight yeah some parts feet

528.73 --> 534.309
across other parts like half a feet and

532.149 --> 537.37
it was suggested like yeah you could

534.309 --> 542.04
climb that would be extremely dangerous

537.37 --> 545.41
I was there with four or five others

542.04 --> 549.759
that I think were not me other type of

545.41 --> 552.129
people Green Team characters and they

549.759 --> 555.839
were all enthusiastically trying to

552.129 --> 558.49
climb up there I was like are you nuts

555.839 --> 561.3090000000001
that's super dangerous why would you

558.49 --> 563.649
want to do that you know you could drop

561.309 --> 567.639
off and get killed and even though it

563.649 --> 570.639
was a dream that just seemed logical to

567.639 --> 573.61
me so I didn't do that just went along

570.639 --> 576.699
and started fooling around with the

573.61 --> 580.3290000000001
swimming pool and then I discovered the

576.699 --> 582.49
pipes and I jumped on them and noticed

580.329 --> 585.4899999999999
like this weird there was a pressure on

582.49 --> 586.9300000000001
it and had a trampoline effect I don't

585.49 --> 589.059
know and that's pretty much where the

586.93 --> 592.62
dream ended but it was all very clear

589.059 --> 594.36
very vivid and it was such a bizarre

592.62 --> 597.809
realization just

594.36 --> 600.779
that there was this crazy thing that was

597.809 --> 602.819
suggestive they're like oh you can you

600.779 --> 606.019
can climb this and people were doing it

602.819 --> 606.019
and I was like that's nuts

606.7 --> 613.09
and I'm pretty sure that a big part of

609.79 --> 616.8399999999999
the message of the dream the thing that

613.09 --> 619.65
it was spawned for in my dream that it's

616.84 --> 619.65
tied into that

625.87 --> 628.44
because

628.81 --> 634.5
yeah it all reflects back even to when I

631.27 --> 642.93
was young you know I had this amazing

634.5 --> 646.41
insane courage like I would do anything

642.93 --> 650.2199999999999
like I didn't care didn't even feel like

646.41 --> 652.77
I was there like I could die or that it

650.22 --> 656.13
mattered or anything and it would just

652.77 --> 659.1899999999999
do stuff and just baffle people

656.13 --> 662.73
sometimes with what I would do like a

659.19 --> 665.5200000000001
certain type of fearlessness and it's

662.73 --> 667.47
almost like that like it reminds me

665.52 --> 670.38
about that and maybe these other

667.47 --> 672.65
characters were reflections of me who I

670.38 --> 672.65
was

675.08 --> 682.339
just one they're like yeah what does

677.269 --> 686.44
that mean is it just a reflection or am

682.339 --> 686.44
i doing something wrong

692.029 --> 696.889
wasn't quite clear about it

695.149 --> 701.12
like the whole thing did feel a little

696.889 --> 703.519
bit ominous and in a way it made me feel

701.12 --> 707.839
this appointed in myself that I wouldn't

703.519 --> 713.149
actually take that crazy risk but yeah

707.839 --> 717.62
the the senseability thinking they were

713.149 --> 722.499
just in the way the rational approach it

717.62 --> 722.499
was in the way and I experienced that

729.029 --> 734.73
Thank You JJ for the super chat

731.709 --> 734.7299999999999
shout out to lasse

739.46 --> 742.51
that's in there is

744.94 --> 750.1300000000001
right well I'd love to say yeah I'm

748.21 --> 752.77
pretty sure I'm not born from a virgin

750.13 --> 757.93
mother since I wasn't her second child

752.77 --> 759.93
and I'm obviously half my father it

757.93 --> 767.9399999999999
looks quite different from my mother so

759.93 --> 767.9399999999999
yeah pretty sure I'm not

777.96 --> 789.99
ooh flatterers letters letters yeah yeah

786.12 --> 793.08
Pater from Lewin you're right and I try

789.99 --> 795.45
to sketch out exactly how now I think it

793.08 --> 799.49
is reflecting trying to learn from a

795.45 --> 799.49
dream in public

804.73 --> 807.799
[Music]

815.67 --> 818.27
what

828.58 --> 842.37
so yeah how are you guys doing hey that

835.32 --> 848.7
got peanuts clerk here thanks for coming

842.37 --> 854.2
hey what's going on lots lots of stuff

848.7 --> 856.089
I've got a new mission I guess yeah and

854.2 --> 859.3900000000001
it is let me off and the thing is is

856.089 --> 860.9200000000001
that that me getting pissed off by it is

859.39 --> 868.899
actually doing it wrong

860.92 --> 872.709
it's like yeah thank you possible puzzle

868.899 --> 879.3
I missed I missed what you were you were

872.709 --> 884.41
talking about a while ago so well I did

879.3 --> 887.62
did you for example read the article I

884.41 --> 889.269
posted I posted many things in the Flat

887.62 --> 893.35
Earth early bird yet you are a part of

889.269 --> 895.18
the flatter 30 word chat right I solved

893.35 --> 897.0
the article you posted but I didn't sit

895.18 --> 902.14
down and read it

897.0 --> 907.149
forgive me no is it is it important do I

902.14 --> 910.06
need to go read it well I wouldn't post

907.149 --> 915.97
it if I wasn't okay

910.06 --> 920.31
oh okay stuff it is about an experiment

915.97 --> 920.3100000000001
somebody did with mice

921.29 --> 929.269
and it is like a microcosm of the world

925.19 --> 930.019
it's pretty fascinating and creepy the

929.269 --> 933.1
same time

930.019 --> 933.1
great that's not

936.63 --> 943.35
when it's just a guy I know from vampire

940.259 --> 946.38
freaks gothic stuff but yeah there's

943.35 --> 951.87
some really serious well-thought-out

946.38 --> 955.319
things that they do sometimes so and get

951.87 --> 960.149
all creepy and [ __ ] some people as well

955.319 --> 963.63
so it's giant mess and usually I do very

960.149 --> 965.19
very little but sometimes somebody posts

963.63 --> 970.019
something that's really interesting or

965.19 --> 972.99
like in historical detail that that

970.019 --> 977.97
doesn't get go afloat anywhere else

972.99 --> 979.7090000000001
see it's like you want to know it all

977.97 --> 981.63
you have to look everywhere even the

979.709 --> 984.6199999999999
places you normally would want to look

981.63 --> 984.62
but

985.51 --> 1000.63
it was concerning population and limited

993.73 --> 1007.1700000000001
confine and what the guy basically did

1000.63 --> 1009.36
is he made a closed-off space with yeah

1007.17 --> 1011.16
a couple of mice that he released in

1009.36 --> 1013.59
there and the whole thing was set up to

1011.16 --> 1016.2199999999999
be an absolute paradise with unlimited

1013.59 --> 1020.9100000000001
food and water and comfort and ease and

1016.22 --> 1023.22
architecture that was adapted to my

1020.91 --> 1025.4099999999999
psychology perfection it was like a

1023.22 --> 1026.4
utopia he created and he released these

1025.41 --> 1028.65
creatures in there

1026.4 --> 1031.73
and it went on from years and he studied

1028.65 --> 1037.199
the cultures that came naturally

1031.73 --> 1038.82
seriously read it it's holy [ __ ] it is

1037.199 --> 1041.79
like a microcosm

1038.82 --> 1045.3
but what happened eventually is it got

1041.79 --> 1049.17
really full creatures got agitated and

1045.3 --> 1052.8899999999999
naturally deviant culture started to

1049.17 --> 1056.3300000000002
spawn up not like separated cultures but

1052.89 --> 1056.3300000000002
behavioral types and

1059.65 --> 1062.4
yeah

1063.36 --> 1069.6
it's it's fascinating and terrifying at

1066.72 --> 1071.909
the same time if if there is any kind of

1069.6 --> 1075.24
comparison to new people in the world

1071.909 --> 1079.14
because eventually it got really full it

1075.24 --> 1082.2
didn't get overcrowded though but the

1079.14 --> 1084.779
creature started to act almost like if

1082.2 --> 1088.3500000000001
it was and just started to get

1084.779 --> 1090.929
disinterested in breeding it just didn't

1088.35 --> 1095.61
want to anymore even though there was

1090.929 --> 1099.45
plenty of food and creatures started to

1095.61 --> 1102.149
get into neurotic behavior become really

1099.45 --> 1104.279
vain so there wasn't even attacking

1102.149 --> 1107.149
really going on there weren't even real

1104.279 --> 1110.94
battles going on except for social

1107.149 --> 1112.61
situations like one meal defending his

1110.94 --> 1119.22
group against another meal it was

1112.61 --> 1121.61
amazing but eventually they all died all

1119.22 --> 1125.269
of them

1121.61 --> 1129.619
the entire population just they let

1125.269 --> 1131.749
themselves die so do you know even

1129.619 --> 1135.9499999999998
though there was still plenty of food

1131.749 --> 1139.97
and everything they all just died dude

1135.95 --> 1142.6390000000001
do you know if did these scientists

1139.97 --> 1145.1000000000001
perform psychological psyops all them

1142.639 --> 1146.9289999999999
nope nothing burger completely left

1145.1 --> 1150.32
until then there are devices they did

1146.929 --> 1152.299
step into the cage though sometimes it

1150.32 --> 1154.1
was but it wasn't really inside this

1152.299 --> 1158.299
look these people were not having lab

1154.1 --> 1160.4889999999998
coats this was just a guy a nerd that

1158.299 --> 1165.019
just thought I'm gonna do this I'm gonna

1160.489 --> 1167.029
make my own little experiment like he

1165.019 --> 1171.08
was probably a biologist or something

1167.029 --> 1173.619
and sociology just anyway yeah it is

1171.08 --> 1173.619
something

1177.77 --> 1187.27
oh yeah and so that hit me hard of

1181.94 --> 1187.27
course yeah and

1188.25 --> 1195.09
yeah all the other things happening the

1192.75 --> 1197.4
reflections of everything the

1195.09 --> 1200.07
synchronicities that I still experience

1197.4 --> 1203.6100000000001
even though I'm not panicky about it

1200.07 --> 1205.47
anymore it's still going on and then I

1203.61 --> 1207.059
have to talk with my dad and he's

1205.47 --> 1210.23
basically saying the same thing he's

1207.059 --> 1219.9189999999999
been saying for 20 years and that is

1210.23 --> 1223.08
stop caring about it it's just like but

1219.919 --> 1226.0200000000002
in a very technical direct sense that

1223.08 --> 1230.1589999999999
does seem to be the solution but then

1226.02 --> 1234.78
again yeah how do you stop caring about

1230.159 --> 1237.9
it and not lose track of everything of

1234.78 --> 1240.84
what really matters all that and or is

1237.9 --> 1243.659
there some kind of micro balance that I

1240.84 --> 1251.8799999999999
should be maintaining it's just a big

1243.659 --> 1253.0490000000002
confrontation to me yeah and well at

1251.88 --> 1256.169
least you're still cool with your day

1253.049 --> 1260.4
what it was just Alisha still have a

1256.169 --> 1264.8400000000001
relationship with a father yet no but it

1260.4 --> 1268.6200000000001
was real it wasn't him deflecting me it

1264.84 --> 1272.07
was really a very serious important

1268.62 --> 1279.3899999999999
message and he explained it to me even

1272.07 --> 1285.039
again so like my intense care towards

1279.39 --> 1288.169
the world doesn't actually help and

1285.039 --> 1290.299
the intense parts especially like

1288.169 --> 1292.489
they're really like I want this to stop

1290.299 --> 1295.6689999999999
I want this to change and it even seems

1292.489 --> 1298.969
like the world is responding exactly the

1295.669 --> 1301.6090000000002
opposite in many ways and that is like

1298.969 --> 1305.809
ultimately it's like a punishment it's a

1301.609 --> 1311.4189999999999
punishment for caring and maybe yeah

1305.809 --> 1312.889
maybe I should just stop getting into

1311.419 --> 1318.469
that and just treat everything

1312.889 --> 1319.789
everything like trolls you know and yeah

1318.469 --> 1323.69
that makes you think like there's people

1319.789 --> 1324.859
in chat sometimes that are trolls and

1323.69 --> 1330.039
they're basically trying to get

1324.859 --> 1333.1999999999998
attention but maybe all these things are

1330.039 --> 1336.739
kind of the same they're just bigger

1333.2 --> 1341.959
more organized were more well-dressed

1336.739 --> 1345.049
trolls that just want attention and that

1341.959 --> 1346.519
are gonna disrupt things if you give

1345.049 --> 1350.749
them the attention

1346.519 --> 1353.239
it's just loose and that feeds back to

1350.749 --> 1358.249
the concept of like yeah maybe I should

1353.239 --> 1360.49
just let the world be the world try to

1358.249 --> 1365.409
do what I do

1360.49 --> 1368.139
and not let myself get so engaged with

1365.409 --> 1371.8600000000001
things maybe do look at it amid more

1368.139 --> 1375.4189999999999
from the distance more reserved stop

1371.86 --> 1381.149
like oh I hate this or I want to stop

1375.419 --> 1381.1490000000001
being so engaging in a emotional sense

1381.84 --> 1388.509
be more neutral about it more like a

1384.34 --> 1390.999
Buddhist yeah I probably need to try

1388.509 --> 1392.679
this it's very counterintuitive it's

1390.999 --> 1398.919
like I've been doing AG the exact

1392.679 --> 1401.6190000000001
opposite all my life that that kind of

1398.919 --> 1403.269
ties into what I was I was trying to put

1401.619 --> 1407.47
into words to you the other day

1403.269 --> 1411.999
I like Monday when I spoke to you about

1407.47 --> 1413.6490000000001
my spirits were really down and I've had

1411.999 --> 1419.049
time to kind of think about it but you

1413.649 --> 1425.08
know so uh what I was trying to tell you

1419.049 --> 1431.83
on Monday is both four years ago before

1425.08 --> 1440.35
I I came to this I was happy I was happy

1431.83 --> 1442.769
I wasn't paranoid I I wasn't angry you

1440.35 --> 1442.769
know what I mean

1443.23 --> 1449.08
and the reason why I was telling you

1446.83 --> 1451.9289999999999
that Monday is because I kept telling

1449.08 --> 1453.46
you you may not remember I I don't know

1451.929 --> 1457.1490000000001
what to do with this I don't know what

1453.46 --> 1463.33
to do with this and the reason is is

1457.149 --> 1466.12
because if if I if I do want to be an

1463.33 --> 1471.8799999999999
activist and if I do want to push Effie

1466.12 --> 1475.09
right and am I taking that person away

1471.88 --> 1481.3500000000001
from their happiness and I'm not putting

1475.09 --> 1481.35
them in paranoia yep

1481.559 --> 1491.649
well that is the counter side

1486.75 --> 1495.22
potentially of it that's why I don't try

1491.649 --> 1497.4399999999998
to push it on anyone but I will be

1495.22 --> 1499.6200000000001
available if people actually want to

1497.44 --> 1499.6200000000001
know

1501.62 --> 1509.539
because i i i can i can really reflect

1506.69 --> 1513.559
on the way I feel right now and I just

1509.539 --> 1516.47
have a lot of animosity I have a lot you

1513.559 --> 1519.6789999999999
know cuz in my head I feel like that and

1516.47 --> 1521.6000000000001
all angles I'm being either

1519.679 --> 1525.77
psychologically attack or kimmel

1521.6 --> 1530.27
chemically attack four years ago I

1525.77 --> 1536.649
wasn't aware of any of that and I I was

1530.27 --> 1536.649
fine I was happy yeah ironic isn't it

1538.0 --> 1547.49
but but flat earth means enough to me

1545.049 --> 1553.37
just something is still holding on

1547.49 --> 1555.559
because that the children before me that

1553.37 --> 1558.4699999999998
went to school they accepted the lives

1555.559 --> 1563.059
the children before them they accepted

1558.47 --> 1568.789
the lives and now here we are we're

1563.059 --> 1574.399
trying to show that hey maybe this is it

1568.789 --> 1582.26
true maybe there's something else does

1574.399 --> 1583.85
that make sense right so well are we are

1582.26 --> 1586.1299999999999
we doing something good

1583.85 --> 1588.6689999999999
yes well or are we doing so you don't

1586.13 --> 1591.6490000000001
get we don't really have a choice okay

1588.669 --> 1593.69
this sounds really bizarre but we don't

1591.649 --> 1597.6789999999999
have a choice and I figured out pretty

1593.69 --> 1600.76
easily why because the control mechanism

1597.679 --> 1606.22
that seems to be so balanced and

1600.76 --> 1608.5
makes people willingly go along with ya

1606.22 --> 1611.65
with lies or with things that are

1608.5 --> 1614.31
insured trusts basically trust in the

1611.65 --> 1620.2
system while the system is forcing us to

1614.31 --> 1625.8
step out of the system by proving that

1620.2 --> 1625.8
it's not trustworthy to us

1629.93 --> 1637.44
do you understand

1632.49 --> 1639.36
and you can't keep you can't stay asleep

1637.44 --> 1644.19
in it anymore

1639.36 --> 1648.36
so so this color is basically waking up

1644.19 --> 1649.89
everyone okay trying to explain it in

1648.36 --> 1652.11
another way because you started out

1649.89 --> 1654.8000000000002
saying that I don't have a choice what

1652.11 --> 1654.8
do you mean there

1659.48 --> 1666.13
well if you'd have a 50/50 choice to

1662.99 --> 1669.549
just stay asleep and trust in the system

1666.13 --> 1672.38
then yeah why wouldn't you go with that

1669.549 --> 1675.2
well the only reason why it's not

1672.38 --> 1678.669
divided like that is because the system

1675.2 --> 1678.669
is proving it's not trustworthy

1678.91 --> 1683.5600000000002
so

1680.92 --> 1685.3000000000002
it's it's like with me a flat earth like

1683.56 --> 1689.1299999999999
I've been confronted with it so many

1685.3 --> 1693.87
times and I just don't have a choice

1689.13 --> 1696.63
it just keeps creeping me back

1693.87 --> 1699.27
and every time I forget everything that

1696.63 --> 1702.3600000000001
comes with it and then I remember

1699.27 --> 1704.6399999999999
everything that comes with it or from

1702.36 --> 1706.8
certain angles some of which may have

1704.64 --> 1711.18
been a little bit distorted by input

1706.8 --> 1713.1599999999999
from others and doesn't really matter if

1711.18 --> 1716.13
I forget it all because I will bump into

1713.16 --> 1720.3000000000002
it again and it will grip me again like

1716.13 --> 1725.2800000000002
oh wow what is this amazing and it's it

1720.3 --> 1731.46
just keeps happening yeah you don't have

1725.28 --> 1735.74
a choice see not really it's just a path

1731.46 --> 1735.74
that is in front of us

1737.27 --> 1746.6299999999999
okay so so basically it's a sequence

1743.6 --> 1750.11
that really I don't have control of and

1746.63 --> 1758.9
whatever is gonna happen is going to

1750.11 --> 1765.08
happen well in grander scale of things -

1758.9 --> 1767.96
yes but you still can do just things

1765.08 --> 1774.05
that you do and you definitely have

1767.96 --> 1776.63
choices in those because I'm I'm way

1774.05 --> 1778.37
past the point of you know I don't I

1776.63 --> 1780.0800000000002
don't care you know cuz of course when

1778.37 --> 1781.04
you try to talk to people they're gonna

1780.08 --> 1782.54
think you're dumb

1781.04 --> 1784.0
they're gonna think they're gonna tell

1782.54 --> 1788.69
you that you need to go back to school

1784.0 --> 1790.67
you know and I'm I'm over that feeling I

1788.69 --> 1794.24
don't I don't get in Bair's you know

1790.67 --> 1800.03
because I know that I was that way you

1794.24 --> 1803.96
know so when I would I go about my day

1800.03 --> 1807.3799999999999
and and I participate in this system I

1803.96 --> 1809.9
met my slave I'm doing like a good

1807.38 --> 1814.0700000000002
little slave should at the end of the

1809.9 --> 1818.5700000000002
day I feel guilty as hell I feel really

1814.07 --> 1824.9299999999998
guilty and then like I said like I was

1818.57 --> 1829.52
telling you Monday because because I

1824.93 --> 1832.43
feel guilty because I'm I'm not going

1829.52 --> 1834.8
against this system that that doesn't

1832.43 --> 1841.97
benefit us all that that we can't trust

1834.8 --> 1844.28
I'm I'm going along with it and it's it

1841.97 --> 1848.99
makes me feel us a sense of guiltiness

1844.28 --> 1851.06
that knowing that everybody around me

1848.99 --> 1855.76
and everything we're doing is is not

1851.06 --> 1855.76
exactly what were intended to be doing

1862.17 --> 1864.95
right right

1864.96 --> 1871.3500000000001
I do feel better than Monday Monday was

1868.11 --> 1876.809
just a very low day for me but I do feel

1871.35 --> 1879.24
better today and see it maybe it's

1876.809 --> 1882.18
easier for a Christian because a

1879.24 --> 1886.02
Christian they can sit down in there and

1882.18 --> 1889.05
they can pray right and I'm not

1886.02 --> 1891.809
religious I don't believe you know men

1889.05 --> 1894.3899999999999
walk on water and people rose from the

1891.809 --> 1897.66
dead you know I don't accept that so I

1894.39 --> 1900.66
don't really I don't really pray so I

1897.66 --> 1903.059
don't really have that that comfort of

1900.66 --> 1908.46
sitting down and and feeling like I'm

1903.059 --> 1911.9289999999999
giving it all to God if you will what I

1908.46 --> 1915.059
hate saying about why don't you try it I

1911.929 --> 1917.46
was a Christian for 18 years red it

1915.059 --> 1919.7
doesn't matter what you are or what you

1917.46 --> 1923.3700000000001
think you are why don't you just drive

1919.7 --> 1927.21
because because I don't I don't want to

1923.37 --> 1929.28
be 65 years old and then look back on my

1927.21 --> 1931.29
life and say damn I should've did that

1929.28 --> 1935.58
or damn I should have been like really

1931.29 --> 1938.82
so you would rather just pretend like it

1935.58 --> 1940.8
was all right until you die and not go

1938.82 --> 1946.02
with what you know is right anyway

1940.8 --> 1948.1499999999999
as soon as you truly figure it out what

1946.02 --> 1952.17
and ladies time reflecting on it at

1948.15 --> 1953.429
least I'm thinking about that choice you

1952.17 --> 1959.7
know at least I'm not being dogmatic

1953.429 --> 1963.0900000000001
about one way the fact that I'm looking

1959.7 --> 1966.929
at my options I think he's I think

1963.09 --> 1970.799
that's mature of me okay

1966.929 --> 1975.3400000000001
yeah I don't see what it really matters

1970.799 --> 1979.799
why you pray for what reason with what

1975.34 --> 1983.47
background I assume it's a technique

1979.799 --> 1991.11
what happened everything who am i

1983.47 --> 1991.1100000000001
praying to every creation to the Creator

1994.679 --> 1999.3300000000002
why even try to personify it

2000.86 --> 2007.01
well I just used I just he is a

2004.82 --> 2009.86
Christian that's an example cuz I know

2007.01 --> 2011.95
that when I was a Christian that's what

2009.86 --> 2015.799
I would do

2011.95 --> 2019.789
but now that I'm not now that that's not

2015.799 --> 2028.58
a part of my life I'm trying to find

2019.789 --> 2031.789
that action okay well like I just pray

2028.58 --> 2037.96
to to god creator or however I

2031.789 --> 2042.71
conceptualize it creation itself and

2037.96 --> 2049.609
yeah Jesus I don't pray to him really I

2042.71 --> 2052.57
just pray with him you know that does

2049.609 --> 2052.5699999999997
that make sense it's

2052.75 --> 2060.76
like swaying to an icon just seemed

2055.21 --> 2063.069
wrong really but I just remember him and

2060.76 --> 2066.8790000000004
like to see him as an example and like

2063.069 --> 2069.7599999999998
try to be as much as him as I do things

2066.879 --> 2081.46
and as I pray then that does make sense

2069.76 --> 2083.4700000000003
to me know pray to him pray with me so

2081.46 --> 2086.399
so let me ask you this what what's the

2083.47 --> 2089.97
difference in in a in a Christian

2086.399 --> 2092.74
praying to Jesus and then a person

2089.97 --> 2094.56
putting their good intentions towards

2092.74 --> 2098.0989999999997
the Earth

2094.56 --> 2098.099
it's the difference

2102.0 --> 2110.65
it's I don't know it's I don't know if

2108.55 --> 2113.2200000000003
there's a lot of difference it's about

2110.65 --> 2113.2200000000003
the interaction

2116.44 --> 2123.19
about trying to do the right thing from

2119.74 --> 2125.7
the perspective that the person does

2123.19 --> 2125.7000000000003
things

2127.5 --> 2135.18
good intentions through the world yeah

2129.63 --> 2137.21
sure why would one even exclude the

2135.18 --> 2137.21
other

2142.2 --> 2148.5299999999997
I don't know I guess I'm because I a lot

2146.64 --> 2152.549
of times I've always wondered is is is a

2148.53 --> 2155.63
Christian that that positive intent that

2152.549 --> 2159.03
they're putting towards Christ are they

2155.63 --> 2160.77
are they filling this this Holy Ghost or

2159.03 --> 2163.17
whatever it's called are they filling

2160.77 --> 2167.569
that because they're putting their

2163.17 --> 2171.7200000000003
positive and tip towards something yes

2167.569 --> 2176.04
so could that be all it is I mean that's

2171.72 --> 2178.02
why I see what's the difference well

2176.04 --> 2180.65
yeah it doesn't have a lot of difference

2178.02 --> 2184.17
oh yeah by the way Thank You Johnny

2180.65 --> 2189.54
f-flat moments for a 2-pound super chat

2184.17 --> 2193.41
donation you're gonna be able to get

2189.54 --> 2196.77
that peanut Wonder soon huh yeah yeah

2193.41 --> 2199.8289999999997
it's ticking it's nice thank you

2196.77 --> 2202.29
thanks a lot what yeah it is about that

2199.829 --> 2205.26
posit it is about but but that's from a

2202.29 --> 2207.72
spiritual energy perspective which of

2205.26 --> 2210.96
all these acts and the focus like how do

2207.72 --> 2213.1189999999997
you do it well I explain how I do it and

2210.96 --> 2216.839
another person may have another type of

2213.119 --> 2222.5
ritual that they do and yeah it's about

2216.839 --> 2222.5
doing it and it working

2226.09 --> 2230.6600000000003
but I'm not gonna make a cup of coffee

2228.35 --> 2234.1
but I wanna ask you something we we you

2230.66 --> 2237.89
said he said you pray like you do birth

2234.1 --> 2242.69
yeah yeah okay so let me ask us when you

2237.89 --> 2245.14
when you pray do you respect a response

2242.69 --> 2249.02
either whether it be through inaction

2245.14 --> 2257.06
nope okay you don't okay but I do hope

2249.02 --> 2259.88
that I'll get something I need but I

2257.06 --> 2262.72
don't expect it or sometimes I kind of

2259.88 --> 2265.7200000000003
do expect it because I'm just desperate

2262.72 --> 2265.72
but

2266.04 --> 2273.15
yeah if you focus on what you want out

2269.01 --> 2276.3
of something then that doesn't work as

2273.15 --> 2281.21
yeah as well as just focusing on what

2276.3 --> 2284.6400000000003
you're giving the universe by the way

2281.21 --> 2288.65
you can't see excuse me I'm gonna make a

2284.64 --> 2288.65
cup of coffee all right you do that

2293.839 --> 2299.44
though

2295.84 --> 2301.3
hey welcome back I just wanted to

2299.44 --> 2306.9
quickly talk to peanuts but now he's

2301.3 --> 2309.13
going to make it coffee no bad timing I

2306.9 --> 2311.71
just was gonna put a question to him

2309.13 --> 2314.67
hopefully can hand me that probably not

2311.71 --> 2317.35
right now yeah

2314.67 --> 2317.86
all right well you I'll join him back in

2317.35 --> 2320.02
a moment

2317.86 --> 2321.1600000000003
and last and wins back all right all

2320.02 --> 2324.72
right

2321.16 --> 2327.91
unless you want me to stay talking but

2324.72 --> 2330.0099999999998
hey yeah I can't here here I just I've

2327.91 --> 2331.93
gotta go on me because I'm gonna be

2330.01 --> 2334.9
laughs go ahead I'm listening

2331.93 --> 2337.7799999999997
go ahead go excellent thanks Peter mm

2334.9 --> 2343.12
first of all your questions are very

2337.78 --> 2347.4
valid and you know but for me I'd have

2343.12 --> 2351.45
to put the question to you what would

2347.4 --> 2355.84
the people do in relation to God before

2351.45 --> 2357.37
the Bible was formed because they were

2355.84 --> 2358.63
still people and they were still

2357.37 --> 2360.16
searching and I'm still looking at this

2358.63 --> 2367.9
dad they're still trying to work it out

2360.16 --> 2371.17
and so there's a verse in the Quran and

2367.9 --> 2376.32
I know there's a lot of controversy but

2371.17 --> 2376.32
yeah I mean let me just read it for you

2377.289 --> 2385.309
if I can't see now it's not gonna work

2382.849 --> 2391.7290000000003
it's gonna make me remember it but

2385.309 --> 2392.529
basically it's talking about ah there we

2391.729 --> 2398.2
go

2392.529 --> 2403.069
that's chapter 2 verse 62 so you can

2398.2 --> 2411.22
research this as much as you need to and

2403.069 --> 2411.22
I just want to join and say this it says

2412.269 --> 2418.43
those who believe in that which was

2415.279 --> 2421.339
revealed to thee Muhammad and those who

2418.43 --> 2423.6499999999996
had Jews and Christians and sabians who

2421.339 --> 2425.17
ever believed in God in the last day and

2423.65 --> 2428.9790000000003
do with right

2425.17 --> 2435.109
surely the reward is with their Lord and

2428.979 --> 2437.1189999999997
the and there shall no fear and no sheep

2435.109 --> 2440.69
fear shall come upon them neither shall

2437.119 --> 2446.6600000000003
they grieve so it's basically to me it's

2440.69 --> 2449.9
saying each person at the time was given

2446.66 --> 2452.719
the message and now in this final time

2449.9 --> 2454.9990000000003
we have the one book that can't be

2452.719 --> 2461.92
altered to go backwards and validate all

2454.999 --> 2466.8689999999997
the others but to me is a personal faith

2461.92 --> 2469.64
you know that I just I can't imagine

2466.869 --> 2474.9500000000003
there's no there's no realm in which you

2469.64 --> 2476.68
could give me a scenario and you know

2474.95 --> 2480.04
just

2476.68 --> 2484.8399999999997
the verses in the Quran about how God

2480.04 --> 2491.17
fashions us God fashions us in the womb

2484.84 --> 2492.88
how he pleases you know and the things

2491.17 --> 2495.9700000000003
that you talked about working for slave

2492.88 --> 2497.65
and things like this is what about what

2495.97 --> 2501.91
about the good you do with that money

2497.65 --> 2504.19
you know the people that you sustain you

2501.91 --> 2508.02
know on the fact you can come on here

2504.19 --> 2511.57
and talk you've got a good heart and so

2508.02 --> 2514.54
if anything you're given a mind to be

2511.57 --> 2520.21
able to contemplate and think and

2514.54 --> 2523.12
question and wonder and I think you know

2520.21 --> 2524.41
reaching out and asking our one is it is

2523.12 --> 2527.68
a fantastic move

2524.41 --> 2530.77
he helped me before I had to go and make

2527.68 --> 2536.64
a very very difficult trip because I'm

2530.77 --> 2536.64
the only one with faith in my family so

2536.9 --> 2549.529
when you pray be still because God hears

2544.88 --> 2551.719
your heart you don't have to utter words

2549.529 --> 2555.079
which I really just got a rule sounds

2551.719 --> 2557.259
controlled through the voice but just be

2555.079 --> 2559.1600000000003
still

2557.259 --> 2570.499
know thyself

2559.16 --> 2573.6499999999996
and just allow no thought let let your

2570.499 --> 2578.1499999999996
heart speak but your mind speak give

2573.65 --> 2582.489
your worries to the Creator build the

2578.15 --> 2585.89
bridge in whatever way that is for you

2582.489 --> 2589.91
but even if this is the inkling that

2585.89 --> 2592.819
you're searching to understand how you

2589.91 --> 2593.6299999999997
could find God in your own way that's

2592.819 --> 2597.619
exactly it

2593.63 --> 2600.009
it's your way and then the Quran it says

2597.619 --> 2602.719
there is no compulsion in religion and

2600.009 --> 2604.849
nobody can offer you heaven and nobody

2602.719 --> 2610.21
can say you're doing this and going

2604.849 --> 2612.559
there but only you can block yourself

2610.21 --> 2615.349
that's all I want to say well the

2612.559 --> 2620.0890000000004
Bissman yeah thank you

2615.349 --> 2622.13
Wow yeah thank you very and it it does

2620.089 --> 2624.769
make sense what he's what are you saying

2622.13 --> 2628.039
and because those are the kind of

2624.769 --> 2631.069
feelings and I've had it I do want to I

2628.039 --> 2634.13
want my own way but I don't I don't want

2631.069 --> 2636.89
to go about my date it's feeling guilty

2634.13 --> 2639.789
and feeling like this is what I could

2636.89 --> 2641.269
have done this is what I should've done

2639.789 --> 2642.9790000000003
then

2641.269 --> 2647.049
yeah man when you said I'm I'm gonna

2642.979 --> 2649.6699999999996
think about that today at my slave job

2647.049 --> 2652.93
but you you're right though you're right

2649.67 --> 2655.549
I have I mean I have four kids and

2652.93 --> 2656.5389999999998
without me they wouldn't have anything

2655.549 --> 2659.66
you know

2656.539 --> 2661.4300000000003
exactly so that slave job you know in

2659.66 --> 2663.95
the Bible it says hard work is the yoke

2661.43 --> 2666.0789999999997
of everybody so rather than look at it

2663.95 --> 2668.569
as slave job look at it as work

2666.079 --> 2669.09
necessary to sustain those things you

2668.569 --> 2676.41
care

2669.09 --> 2679.01
more than yourself because you're a

2676.41 --> 2679.0099999999998
loving father

2680.21 --> 2687.98
nobody yeah thank you and I'm in the

2683.029 --> 2690.89
water that I definitely uh it's a good

2687.98 --> 2692.599
way to start my day man man I'm

2690.89 --> 2695.93
definitely you definitely are you gotta

2692.599 --> 2698.089
leave yeah I'm penny I'm gonna go I'm

2695.93 --> 2699.589
gonna go now I just I just wouldn't have

2698.089 --> 2701.839
been out of sleep right man if I didn't

2699.589 --> 2705.02
tell you that yeah you have your own way

2701.839 --> 2708.589
it's called your journey and just you

2705.02 --> 2710.96
know the one thing is absolutely to me

2708.589 --> 2712.94
you stood before the Creator before you

2710.96 --> 2716.779
came here and so the part of you can

2712.94 --> 2720.4700000000003
either be shut off and seek or or let

2716.779 --> 2722.119
that part be filled by what yeah only

2720.47 --> 2724.609
the Creator can fill that part that's

2722.119 --> 2727.13
missing if you're seeking but the people

2724.609 --> 2730.369
not seeking have stopped searching using

2727.13 --> 2734.6800000000003
scripture and context to say it's not

2730.369 --> 2739.9700000000003
worth it again all the best thank God

2734.68 --> 2740.8689999999997
show you your way thank you Mary thank

2739.97 --> 2746.3799999999997
you you're welcome

2740.869 --> 2746.38
thanks Alan I thought you in thank you

2750.19 --> 2757.0
okay I'll see you later

2752.89 --> 2760.1189999999997
Thanks yeah thanks for popping by oh

2757.0 --> 2760.119
thank you

2760.88 --> 2771.8900000000003
I feel almost I realize I didn't mean to

2770.42 --> 2774.7690000000002
make this about me I just

2771.89 --> 2777.44
no no but like that was a lot more

2774.769 --> 2781.0389999999998
sensible in retrospect than than what I

2777.44 --> 2787.43
had to say I feel it was just a really

2781.039 --> 2792.3190000000004
good positive message I I didn't really

2787.43 --> 2795.799
have that maybe maybe that's what I

2792.319 --> 2799.479
needed I don't even know it if I'm doing

2795.799 --> 2799.479
the right thing at this moment it's just

2803.98 --> 2811.809
maybe that's what I should be doing just

2808.63 --> 2814.9900000000002
praying with this stuff but I deal with

2811.809 --> 2817.299
with my worries towards the world but

2814.99 --> 2819.97
just yeah just popped it in there like

2817.299 --> 2825.67
as he was talking like oh [ __ ] yeah

2819.97 --> 2828.9399999999996
maybe he makes a good point instead of

2825.67 --> 2831.91
trying to drop it and like trying to cut

2828.94 --> 2836.67
it off from there getting thrown out

2831.91 --> 2840.25
there I should actually pray with that

2836.67 --> 2844.7400000000002
that's that's interesting I'm gonna try

2840.25 --> 2848.829
that because I don't pray for big things

2844.74 --> 2851.069
that's the way I I pray for simple

2848.829 --> 2851.069
things

2851.72 --> 2854.3799999999997
right

2858.65 --> 2862.9100000000003
but kind of like I was saying maybe

2860.66 --> 2870.89
maybe maybe that's what I need to hear

2862.91 --> 2872.96
you know maybe that's you know yeah for

2870.89 --> 2877.279
you to yeah yeah I retrospect yeah you

2872.96 --> 2880.2200000000003
you are kind of emphasizing the negative

2877.279 --> 2882.38
aspects and the sheep you can tell make

2880.22 --> 2887.569
a great point that yeah you do it for

2882.38 --> 2889.9700000000003
for a reason and that reason is

2887.569 --> 2899.529
important enough for you to keep on

2889.97 --> 2907.0589999999997
doing so you know if what I do die and

2899.529 --> 2910.16
if I do stand before whatever amazing

2907.059 --> 2915.289
intelligence created me and what I meant

2910.16 --> 2920.569
I want to at least stand proud in front

2915.289 --> 2922.67
of that amazing thing whatever it is

2920.569 --> 2930.069
whether it be God whether it be some

2922.67 --> 2933.73
type of energy does that make sense I

2930.069 --> 2933.73
don't want any shame

2936.01 --> 2940.0200000000004
right well yeah

2940.52 --> 2946.88
maybe I don't know I'm just saying

2943.69 --> 2952.13
nothing maybe that shame is just for

2946.88 --> 2956.119
this time here and after it you will be

2952.13 --> 2959.02
relieved of it cost you at least you did

2956.119 --> 2959.02
it for a good reason

2959.5 --> 2965.96
