6.83 --> 36.719
[Music]

52.16 --> 56.718999999999994

84.36 --> 89.46
always use it

87.36 --> 91.45
right

89.46 --> 93.119
so the weather today

91.45 --> 97.34
[Music]

93.119 --> 97.34
uh my camera is being extra

98.4 --> 105.24000000000001
foggy today

100.68 --> 105.24000000000001
the weather is very beautiful again

106.86 --> 112.68
no drills

109.56 --> 114.78
this time or so it seems

112.68 --> 117.5
yeah and

114.78 --> 120.299
yesterday

117.5 --> 122.939
was a great show by the way I watched it

120.299 --> 126.74000000000001
back from beginning to end it's it's one

122.939 --> 126.74
of my best shows because it is

126.78 --> 131.94
very focused

128.7 --> 134.7
I gave a lot of concentrated advice

131.94 --> 136.26
So Yesterday turned out to be like a

134.7 --> 138.44
really good show that I'm very happy

136.26 --> 138.44
about

141.72 --> 147.42
but yeah I also talked about how there

144.599 --> 150.29999999999998
were like trails

147.42 --> 153.55999999999997
and that perhaps

150.3 --> 153.56
I could basically

153.72 --> 157.7
like get those Trails away

158.099 --> 163.319
by trying to mimic

160.44 --> 166.319
and spiritual level same energies as

163.319 --> 169.44
Oregon generators

166.319 --> 172.2
so I did that yesterday

169.44 --> 175.92
guess what

172.2 --> 179.22
super blue clear skies

175.92 --> 180.599
well not not super blue not as good as

179.22 --> 182.76
this but

180.599 --> 186.73899999999998
very blue skies

182.76 --> 186.739
it it seemed to have worked

187.92 --> 195.01899999999998
so I'm gonna try to remember that and

190.8 --> 195.019
keep testing it out

198.84 --> 203.28
because I really do like Clear Blue

201.18 --> 206.34
Skies

203.28 --> 208.98
and hey EF5 for some mysterious reason

206.34 --> 212.22
can do something about it

208.98 --> 214.73899999999998
seemingly so then that seems like a

212.22 --> 217.739
worthwhile thing to uh

214.739 --> 217.739
explore

218.519 --> 225.0
right

220.86 --> 228.14000000000001
anyway hello Mike zadunich first in chat

225.0 --> 228.14
good to see you

234.18 --> 239.239
are we not like Dells what

239.7 --> 242.599
what do you mean

249.599 --> 255.42
right anyway it is Tuesday the 14th of

252.599 --> 257.88
June 2022

255.42 --> 261.56
I am starting a bit late but I guess

257.88 --> 261.56
that's traditional by now

267.3 --> 272.479
yeah I did get up a bit late today

272.82 --> 279.259
[Music]

274.86 --> 279.259
just some extra sleepy or something

280.08 --> 286.03999999999996
posted a video about his Skies yesterday

282.9 --> 286.03999999999996
yeah I saw that

292.56 --> 298.38
right so yeah he's

295.4 --> 301.4
assuming he can't do anything about it

298.38 --> 301.4
and moping

302.58 --> 307.5
although look if it's specifically

305.1 --> 310.5
chemtrail-based

307.5 --> 312.9
yeah I think something could potentially

310.5 --> 314.52
be done about that or at least I'm

312.9 --> 318.71999999999997
trying it out

314.52 --> 321.539
right that would seem so yeah I know it

318.72 --> 324.06
kind of seems like but hey if it

321.539 --> 326.639
freaking works you know or at least

324.06 --> 327.72
seems to work like even if it just seems

326.639 --> 330.8
to work

327.72 --> 330.8
I'm good with it

332.52 --> 339.919
right so I'm testing it out

335.4 --> 339.919
I'm just not assuming helplessness

346.699 --> 353.52000000000004
right but yeah if it's just like rainy

349.919 --> 354.96
Skies like lots of clouds

353.52 --> 359.88
I don't think you could do something

354.96 --> 363.0
about that it's not like oh rainy clouds

359.88 --> 364.819
um I'm gonna like meditate you away no

363.0 --> 368.46
no it's

364.819 --> 370.74
Chemtrails very specific not regular

368.46 --> 372.71999999999997
clouds

370.74 --> 374.40000000000003
so

372.72 --> 377.34000000000003
that's

374.4 --> 380.94
came on to the idea through weird

377.34 --> 382.56
sources people like Freeman nobody might

380.94 --> 384.06
nobody of you might have even heard of

382.56 --> 385.8
him

384.06 --> 388.56
I don't know what he's doing these days

385.8 --> 390.36
I think he's still active

388.56 --> 394.259
but

390.36 --> 397.199
he came up with that idea argon that you

394.259 --> 401.539
can get it away and made all these Mimi

397.199 --> 401.539
videos about it like even around 2010

402.06 --> 407.699
and

404.66 --> 411.72
I felt like

407.699 --> 414.479
this is not fake it seems so kooky it's

411.72 --> 416.22
not fake and I've had other contacts

414.479 --> 419.21999999999997
that were people that were into Oregon

416.22 --> 421.58000000000004
and they were all very reassured that it

419.22 --> 421.58000000000004
worked

422.34 --> 426.11999999999995
so

423.96 --> 430.08
just using

426.12 --> 432.66
my personal abilities to mimic try and

430.08 --> 434.81899999999996
mimic the effect

432.66 --> 437.09900000000005
it's basically like praying the

434.819 --> 439.74
Chemtrails away

437.099 --> 442.08
effectively

439.74 --> 445.46000000000004
so

442.08 --> 445.46
what are chemtrails

449.46 --> 452.0
well

452.28 --> 458.21999999999997
there

454.979 --> 459.9
why not exactly know what it is that

458.22 --> 462.36
they spray

459.9 --> 466.15999999999997
there's a lot of suggestions and there

462.36 --> 471.96000000000004
are examples of like

466.16 --> 473.879
aluminum dioxide and barium salt

471.96 --> 476.96
but

473.879 --> 479.16
I've never had like conclusive

476.96 --> 481.979
satisfactory evidence that that is

479.16 --> 484.5
happening everywhere all the time

481.979 --> 486.78
also that would have like long-term

484.5 --> 488.28
consequences and it's already happening

486.78 --> 489.85999999999996
for

488.28 --> 492.84
guys

489.86 --> 496.44
27 years

492.84 --> 498.419
yeah that's a long time

496.44 --> 501.18
to do that

498.419 --> 504.29999999999995
so if they had been spraying with these

501.18 --> 509.28000000000003
specific type of chemicals after 27

504.3 --> 511.919
years the land would be ruined it would

509.28 --> 514.4399999999999
be very much ruined

511.919 --> 517.019
doesn't seem like it

514.44 --> 519.24
so I have to then draw logical

517.019 --> 522.12
conclusion

519.24 --> 523.88
it's not that stuff constantly

522.12 --> 526.98
but there is

523.88 --> 531.6
persistent drills and they're always

526.98 --> 534.24
very high altitude they're probably not

531.6 --> 537.3000000000001
from any airplanes that come from

534.24 --> 540.0600000000001
airports they're probably not commercial

537.3 --> 541.26
planes there are high altitude planes

540.06 --> 543.959
and

541.26 --> 545.9399999999999
they're very likely

543.959 --> 549.5999999999999
like from

545.94 --> 553.2
military air bases

549.6 --> 555.3000000000001
and it's not official anywhere here like

553.2 --> 556.9200000000001
they don't recognize that there even is

555.3 --> 559.9799999999999
that happening

556.92 --> 563.399
at all so

559.98 --> 565.62
right yeah and sometimes planes leave

563.399 --> 568.56
trails and then they evaporate very

565.62 --> 572.04
quickly because it's moist

568.56 --> 576.18
right it's the moist from in the engines

572.04 --> 579.36
then the moist first forms a cloud then

576.18 --> 581.2399999999999
it dissolves in the air it literally

579.36 --> 583.14
becomes

581.24 --> 587.1
evaporated

583.14 --> 590.04
right if it doesn't evaporate that means

587.1 --> 593.58
it's persistent and that means it's not

590.04 --> 594.8389999999999
moist because moist would dissolve it's

593.58 --> 599.399
other stuff

594.839 --> 601.0790000000001
so dust something solid

599.399 --> 604.38
right

601.079 --> 607.92
but what exactly is it

604.38 --> 611.76
like is it aluminum dioxide and barium

607.92 --> 616.4399999999999
salts or is it like Silicon dust

611.76 --> 616.4399999999999
like it could be whatever

617.1 --> 622.98
doesn't seem extremely toxic because

619.44 --> 625.399
we're still here nature is still doing

622.98 --> 625.399
fine

636.72 --> 640.7
so I hope that answers your question

642.54 --> 647.36
in DB

644.64 --> 649.38
ldvr

647.36 --> 652.279
[Music]

649.38 --> 652.279
I was up with my

654.6 --> 657.44
with my stop it

660.02 --> 663.22
[Music]

667.24 --> 670.309
[Music]

673.71 --> 678.8000000000001
[Music]

676.62 --> 678.8
foreign

719.579 --> 721.76
foreign

727.399 --> 732.48
debate was great

730.32 --> 735.12
it's a good show

732.48 --> 738.2
did not last very long though the after

735.12 --> 738.2
show unfortunately

739.019 --> 744.42
but it was a good show overall

742.44 --> 749.4200000000001
being forwarded

744.42 --> 749.42
letters debate in an hour and 15 minutes

753.079 --> 757.16
uh watch the Blake seven

757.62 --> 763.26
I've heard a couple of people talk about

759.899 --> 766.44
praying away Chemtrails that's funny

763.26 --> 768.3
really either have peaches in it

766.44 --> 771.899
who

768.3 --> 774.779
because I didn't get it from anybody

771.899 --> 777.959
I based this concept

774.779 --> 781.139
on something that just came up with me

777.959 --> 784.0189999999999
and originally the idea is well as I

781.139 --> 787.44
already said it's from Freeman

784.019 --> 789.3
I did like not the praying it away

787.44 --> 790.6800000000001
although he might have even mentioned it

789.3 --> 793.3389999999999
at the time

790.68 --> 796.38
mostly about how Oregon

793.339 --> 798.6600000000001
blasters like I think he even like made

796.38 --> 800.82
and sold those things or something or

798.66 --> 803.2199999999999
going blasters like the Bazooka with

800.82 --> 804.6
this stuff in it doesn't actually shoot

803.22 --> 807.3000000000001
anything

804.6 --> 808.9200000000001
no projectile and then you aim it at

807.3 --> 812.24
this the camp trails and then it

808.92 --> 812.24
evaporates very quickly

816.3 --> 821.4799999999999
so I got that from Freeman from over a

818.88 --> 821.48
decade ago

828.48 --> 832.88
who else is talking about that BJC net

846.12 --> 849.199
come on guys

849.72 --> 853.6800000000001
it is one of those slow days where

852.06 --> 856.1389999999999
everybody's like

853.68 --> 859.8199999999999
when their keyboards are covered in tar

856.139 --> 859.82
or something God

867.41 --> 870.24
[Music]

868.86 --> 874.74
ah

870.24 --> 874.74
awake Souls oh really wow

877.019 --> 879.98
all righty then

884.04 --> 889.199
what a weird character that is Wake

887.1 --> 890.5790000000001
Souls

889.199 --> 892.38
weird

890.579 --> 895.019
because yeah

892.38 --> 897.899
I think he's pretty much a loony then

895.019 --> 902.1
again yeah compared to me yeah yeah he

897.899 --> 902.1
is compared to me but

903.18 --> 907.8599999999999
he does like

905.16 --> 909.899
sporadically bring up really interesting

907.86 --> 912.9590000000001
points

909.899 --> 914.579
he does seem to have a knack in of doing

912.959 --> 917.8389999999999
that

914.579 --> 917.8389999999999
in between it all

917.94 --> 920.899
so that's funny

924.12 --> 930.42
right but with me look it's not praying

927.66 --> 932.579
in the sense that oh dear Lord Jesus

930.42 --> 934.74
Christ please get the Chemtrails right

932.579 --> 937.3199999999999
now it's not like that at all it's not

934.74 --> 939.98
that sort of praying it's literally

937.32 --> 942.839
it's about resonation it's

939.98 --> 946.019
non-information based not communication

942.839 --> 951.6600000000001
information based it's just like

946.019 --> 954.54
feel what it feels like that does it

951.66 --> 957.5
and then become it

954.54 --> 957.5
you become it

957.779 --> 965.04
you mimic like being an Oregon generator

962.16 --> 966.24
and then just have the influence that it

965.04 --> 969.06
would have

966.24 --> 972.36
that's how I do it

969.06 --> 974.54
so I do a lot of things by the way

972.36 --> 974.54
foreign

980.25 --> 983.44
[Music]

984.199 --> 988.04
does he need to be careful

997.68 --> 1007.16
we watch this thing for the same reasons

1003.019 --> 1007.16
what are you talking about molotovarones

1007.519 --> 1010.839
you mean my show

1019.02 --> 1024.9189999999999
[Music]

1035.539 --> 1038.319
guys

1040.64 --> 1050.48
right like is everybody like

1045.579 --> 1053.059
keyboard [ __ ] I mean

1050.48 --> 1057.38
since I asked that question I could have

1053.059 --> 1060.2
typed like at least three full comments

1057.38 --> 1065.24
of a hundred two hundred characters by

1060.2 --> 1065.24
now like is everybody uh

1065.26 --> 1071.919
uh uh sorry I'll be ready in five

1069.5 --> 1071.919

dude hello

1075.679 --> 1081.26
hello hurry up

1078.14 --> 1083.539
stop being so slow

1081.26 --> 1085.94
if I ask a question I hope to get an

1083.539 --> 1089.14
answer like within three seconds not

1085.94 --> 1089.14
within five minutes

1094.89 --> 1102.039
[Music]

1106.58 --> 1109.12
foreign

1112.539 --> 1117.46
different things out doing on that

1115.28 --> 1117.46
channel

1117.679 --> 1120.52
okay

1124.58 --> 1130.78
like what

1126.38 --> 1130.7800000000002
that's extremely non-specific

1133.039 --> 1139.179
why can't you guys just say what you

1136.22 --> 1142.52
mean instead of always

1139.179 --> 1147.1000000000001
running around it

1142.52 --> 1147.1
say it just say it

1157.34 --> 1161.539
Mike's the niche

1159.62 --> 1165.02
what

1161.539 --> 1169.299
different things were pointed out to you

1165.02 --> 1169.299
by someone on that channel

1200.24 --> 1206.72
okay guys this is intolerable

1203.36 --> 1208.4599999999998
I'm just going to ignore you now Chad

1206.72 --> 1210.74
and I'm just going to talk about

1208.46 --> 1213.2
something else because you're all

1210.74 --> 1215.659
[ __ ] today

1213.2 --> 1218.0
you're gonna type like five full

1215.659 --> 1220.5390000000002
sentences since now

1218.0 --> 1220.539
five

1228.62 --> 1233.059
okay you're preparing for something else

1230.84 --> 1235.82
okay that that explains you don't have

1233.059 --> 1238.1589999999999
your attention with it fine

1235.82 --> 1240.3799999999999
blah blah blah something vague about

1238.159 --> 1241.88
some Channel nobody understands what

1240.38 --> 1245.6200000000001
you're talking about but you gotta go

1241.88 --> 1245.6200000000001
fine go then

1251.08 --> 1255.62
right so there was a pretty good video

1253.58 --> 1257.72
on Michael cam

1255.62 --> 1259.8799999999999
lap times four

1257.72 --> 1261.679
it's like a summarization video of

1259.88 --> 1263.7800000000002
different people saying very sensible

1261.679 --> 1265.88
things about the realm

1263.78 --> 1266.96
including a piece of Nathan Oakley in

1265.88 --> 1270.5590000000002
there

1266.96 --> 1273.14
it's a good video watch it

1270.559 --> 1276.6789999999999
if you like want to just hang around and

1273.14 --> 1281.3200000000002
not have a lot of Faculty activity on

1276.679 --> 1281.3200000000002
actually doing stuff and watch that

1281.96 --> 1287.98
and just sit back and watch and and not

1285.02 --> 1287.98
do anything

1288.38 --> 1292.0590000000002
but you're also keen on doing

1308.08 --> 1314.08
ah okay it's medical situation then I

1311.9 --> 1314.0800000000002
guess

1318.32 --> 1325.1799999999998
I wish it was yesterday when everybody

1320.78 --> 1328.339
was just immediately fluent

1325.18 --> 1328.3390000000002
[Music]

1335.9 --> 1339.88
all right so that video was pretty cool

1342.34 --> 1347.26
made by Jim Bob was pretty awesome again

1348.08 --> 1353.02
didn't watch the whole thing but a lot

1350.72 --> 1353.02
of it

1353.84 --> 1358.9599999999998
yeah

1355.34 --> 1358.9599999999998
I watched more blake7

1359.36 --> 1365.78
it is getting really good

1362.9 --> 1368.659
and it's funny because I even like

1365.78 --> 1370.6399999999999
the way they they explore the character

1368.659 --> 1373.1000000000001
Arc

1370.64 --> 1376.3400000000001
it's kind of starting to remind me even

1373.1 --> 1380.1789999999999
of firefly and how they did their

1376.34 --> 1383.4189999999999
character portrayal so I really call it

1380.179 --> 1386.6200000000001
like now it's unrolling in the way that

1383.419 --> 1389.6000000000001
well that definitely confirms my

1386.62 --> 1392.059
comparison earlier

1389.6 --> 1394.3999999999999
like was that yesterday or the day

1392.059 --> 1397.34
before talking about it

1394.4 --> 1399.0800000000002
it's really funny to now recognize like

1397.34 --> 1400.8799999999999
yeah that's just like how they did it in

1399.08 --> 1403.8799999999999
Firefly awesome

1400.88 --> 1403.88
yes

1404.48 --> 1408.82
so enjoying that series again

1413.659 --> 1419.1200000000001
oh yeah

1415.159 --> 1423.2
it was an interesting video bit on the

1419.12 --> 1425.9599999999998
Alex Jones Show Mike Adams was on there

1423.2 --> 1427.88
and he had like his microscope with him

1425.96 --> 1432.38
like live on air

1427.88 --> 1434.659
and they were basically showing and yeah

1432.38 --> 1437.9
live showing even under the microscope

1434.659 --> 1440.5390000000002
that was pretty interesting uh well what

1437.9 --> 1443.779
is called supposedly blood clots

1440.539 --> 1445.7
relating to vac situation but basically

1443.779 --> 1447.559
explain like these are not blood clots

1445.7 --> 1450.14
here look at why

1447.559 --> 1452.779
it's a very weird

1450.14 --> 1454.159
structure that is obviously not a blood

1452.779 --> 1456.62
clot

1454.159 --> 1460.0390000000002
so yeah

1456.62 --> 1462.7399999999998
some live on air medical really yeah

1460.039 --> 1464.96
preliminary research basically very

1462.74 --> 1468.02
interesting I love it when Infowars like

1464.96 --> 1470.0
does that sort of thing and Mike Adams

1468.02 --> 1473.3799999999999
especially

1470.0 --> 1473.38
is all about that

1474.32 --> 1478.9399999999998
I like it much more when he does that

1476.179 --> 1482.179
than when he starts talking about nuke

1478.94 --> 1484.5800000000002
doom and all that sort of crap I don't

1482.179 --> 1486.44
like his fear porn site but I do

1484.58 --> 1488.8999999999999
definitely like his medical

1486.44 --> 1492.5800000000002
entrepreneurship

1488.9 --> 1492.5800000000002
so that was interesting

1493.22 --> 1496.3600000000001
mostly anyway

1498.08 --> 1502.12
let me find the video for you

1503.2 --> 1511.9
oh also apparently 99 of monkey pox

1508.059 --> 1516.98
cases are gay men

1511.9 --> 1519.6200000000001
uh I did not call that at all except the

1516.98 --> 1521.84
first day I heard about monkeypox I

1519.62 --> 1524.36
immediately called it butt monkey pox

1521.84 --> 1526.34
and I totally called it by the way not

1524.36 --> 1531.08
the only one

1526.34 --> 1533.84
it's just upon first glance I knew

1531.08 --> 1536.86
monkey pox is for the gay

1533.84 --> 1536.86
and it is

1543.38 --> 1547.419
anyway here is a link

1549.279 --> 1554.779
it is kind of gross though

1552.62 --> 1558.1589999999999
so yeah don't eat this while you're

1554.779 --> 1558.159
having breakfast or something

1564.32 --> 1570.7
you like turtles

1567.2 --> 1570.7
nobody gives a [ __ ]

1580.58 --> 1583.58
right

1585.98 --> 1591.279
[Music]

1588.32 --> 1591.279
there's that

1595.14 --> 1598.3090000000002
[Music]

1608.38 --> 1616.22
oh yeah own Benjamin

1612.52 --> 1619.1589999999999
at Christopher Gardner on again I

1616.22 --> 1622.46
haven't watched too much of it like

1619.159 --> 1625.9
20 minutes or something but yeah

1622.46 --> 1625.9
should be very interesting

1626.72 --> 1629.72
uh

1634.279 --> 1637.299
that's about it

1640.64 --> 1646.88
there was some weird

1643.22 --> 1649.279
the government emergency thing yesterday

1646.88 --> 1653.0
apparently I even saw it like on bus

1649.279 --> 1655.7
stops like digital bus stops had that

1653.0 --> 1658.039
except I have no idea

1655.7 --> 1659.72
what it was whether it was a training or

1658.039 --> 1662.0
whether it was some serious emergency I

1659.72 --> 1666.02
just know I don't give a [ __ ] because

1662.0 --> 1667.58
that thing can only ever be used for

1666.02 --> 1671.12
fake [ __ ]

1667.58 --> 1673.9399999999998
so it's like oh propaganda alarm oh are

1671.12 --> 1676.1589999999999
you a dumbass then go to this site

1673.94 --> 1679.8990000000001
immediately and buy our propaganda

1676.159 --> 1679.8990000000001
that's obviously [ __ ]

1680.659 --> 1686.96
because there's not gonna be a real

1684.08 --> 1690.6789999999999
emergency coming from that broadcast

1686.96 --> 1694.6000000000001
system at this point it's fully

1690.679 --> 1694.6000000000001
liberal [ __ ] control

1695.84 --> 1698.98
hey Godzilla

1705.559 --> 1712.46
dude yeah Pete dude if you take anything

1709.58 --> 1715.24
on face value from Alex Jones you're a

1712.46 --> 1715.24
[ __ ] [ __ ]

1718.039 --> 1724.039
I mean I haven't take anything directly

1721.22 --> 1727.039
on face value from what he said

1724.039 --> 1731.419
since 2008

1727.039 --> 1736.279
because he talks like horse [ __ ] all the

1731.419 --> 1739.22
time in between the really good things

1736.279 --> 1740.84
he's like a real he makes a soup out of

1739.22 --> 1743.6000000000001
everything he's like oh look at this

1740.84 --> 1747.6999999999998
precious hardcore data oh now here in

1743.6 --> 1747.6999999999998
here take my propaganda bait

1749.44 --> 1756.74
yeah Alex we know thanks for the

1752.539 --> 1759.32
precious data and yeah no thanks for the

1756.74 --> 1762.559
for the Fairborn puke

1759.32 --> 1765.8799999999999
and nonsense Hysteria

1762.559 --> 1765.8799999999999
thank you not for that

1768.679 --> 1774.679
but uh Hey when there's literal stuff

1771.38 --> 1776.8400000000001
being done it's like yeah it's not blah

1774.679 --> 1779.72
blah blah blah blah or hysteria it's

1776.84 --> 1782.1789999999999
just oh actual things yeah it's really

1779.72 --> 1784.1000000000001
interesting that's interesting

1782.179 --> 1787.52
when that happens

1784.1 --> 1790.2199999999998
right because that is just what it is

1787.52 --> 1793.1589999999999
it's not a suggestion blah blah blah

1790.22 --> 1797.44
blah it's like oh look look at this this

1793.159 --> 1797.44
is what it is that's interesting

1799.52 --> 1804.62
hey Susie yes yeah he does make a soup

1802.46 --> 1806.8400000000001
out of everything

1804.62 --> 1810.9189999999999
it's mean like yeah

1806.84 --> 1813.1399999999999
he made so many crappy predictions that

1810.919 --> 1815.779
like yeah if you scatter gun like 20

1813.14 --> 1817.279
different doomsday predictions of what's

1815.779 --> 1819.62
gonna happen

1817.279 --> 1820.96
you're probably gonna get one of them

1819.62 --> 1823.76
rights

1820.96 --> 1826.3400000000001
and now he's like oh yes Alex sure

1823.76 --> 1828.86
that's right of course because I said

1826.34 --> 1833.12
that thing that time

1828.86 --> 1836.0
yes let's just exclude the 19 other

1833.12 --> 1839.12
times that didn't come true not even

1836.0 --> 1843.279
close it was just embarrassing fearport

1839.12 --> 1843.279
yeah let's not mention those times

1845.6 --> 1850.24
thank you but that's right there is some

1848.48 --> 1853.88
good stuff too

1850.24 --> 1856.94
and especially like a lot of the staff

1853.88 --> 1859.7600000000002
is interesting like I like the project I

1856.94 --> 1862.7
like what he's done overall despite all

1859.76 --> 1866.6
the Fairborn it's just the fear point is

1862.7 --> 1870.559
just a business model to him basically

1866.6 --> 1872.799
and I would never yeah do something like

1870.559 --> 1872.799
that

1872.899 --> 1879.6789999999999
but yeah he does still like have

1876.62 --> 1882.559
connections he is really does form like

1879.679 --> 1885.3200000000002
a front line even if just artificially

1882.559 --> 1887.72
and it is what it is it works

1885.32 --> 1891.2
and there's interesting data there too

1887.72 --> 1893.72
and that makes it worth it

1891.2 --> 1898.1000000000001
right can't say something like that

1893.72 --> 1901.1000000000001
about CNN I mean that's all garbage and

1898.1 --> 1904.76
none of it is actually worth it

1901.1 --> 1907.399
it's almost shocking even when they sort

1904.76 --> 1908.72
of say something truthful like it's

1907.399 --> 1910.5189999999998
shocking

1908.72 --> 1912.14
right well that's not the case with Alex

1910.519 --> 1914.779
Jones

1912.14 --> 1916.3990000000001
he does say a lot of interesting things

1914.779 --> 1918.799
and truthful things

1916.399 --> 1920.4189999999999
and then he just makes a giant Shih Tzu

1918.799 --> 1922.6399999999999
soup out of it

1920.419 --> 1924.88
and mixes in Endless amounts of fear

1922.64 --> 1924.88
porn

1928.58 --> 1932.779
the [ __ ]

1930.2 --> 1934.3400000000001
do I consider myself a sigma well as

1932.779 --> 1936.44
soon as I figure out what that actually

1934.34 --> 1939.26
is

1936.44 --> 1942.3200000000002
I've heard it's Sigma Omega I don't

1939.26 --> 1945.2
understand it at all

1942.32 --> 1947.299
I don't understand Sigma I don't

1945.2 --> 1952.22
understand Omega

1947.299 --> 1955.399
like even when Parks or Owen is talking

1952.22 --> 1958.159
about I just don't understand it I don't

1955.399 --> 1961.8799999999999
understand an example of it I don't get

1958.159 --> 1962.96
those things I get the alpha beta Gamma

1961.88 --> 1965.98
Delta

1962.96 --> 1965.98
I get those

1966.38 --> 1972.159
Sigma

1968.6 --> 1972.1589999999999
I don't understand that

1985.58 --> 1991.059
William Cooper

1988.279 --> 1995.059
it's getting close to the truth

1991.059 --> 1995.059
please Godzilla

1996.679 --> 2001.679
down don't do that to yourself man

2003.279 --> 2009.1
that's not how it works

2006.34 --> 2012.1
getting close to the truth

2009.1 --> 2014.4399999999998
dude they're all part of it

2012.1 --> 2017.74
like all these people are all freaking

2014.44 --> 2020.38
MK Ultra people all of them

2017.74 --> 2022.419
I don't think there's anybody like in

2020.38 --> 2024.94
America especially that's gone into that

2022.419 --> 2028.48
that is not subject has not been

2024.94 --> 2030.3990000000001
subjected by MK Ultra in some way

2028.48 --> 2032.38
like I really think that they're just

2030.399 --> 2035.1
controlled opposition plants and they

2032.38 --> 2035.1000000000001
don't even know it

2035.26 --> 2040.059
I think that I think that they are

2037.48 --> 2043.299
created to be opposition

2040.059 --> 2045.039
that is controlled they just don't know

2043.299 --> 2047.26
they are

2045.039 --> 2050.5
that's what I think

2047.26 --> 2053.879
Bill Cooper Alex Jones with all those

2050.5 --> 2053.879
guys all of them

2059.379 --> 2063.5989999999997
they're just tied in with all this weird

2061.899 --> 2065.22
secret service

2063.599 --> 2067.8990000000003
creepy

2065.22 --> 2070.0
arguably magic stuff

2067.899 --> 2074.0789999999997
Owen

2070.0 --> 2076.619
yeah arguably Owen too

2074.079 --> 2076.619
I mean

2079.419 --> 2084.879
it's just that it seems like he's very

2082.0 --> 2087.24
much broken free it's not like you the

2084.879 --> 2087.24
thing is

2089.44 --> 2094.179
it's all weird it's like just because

2092.2 --> 2096.48
you are that doesn't mean you're not

2094.179 --> 2096.48
free

2097.3 --> 2103.02
right that you can't actually break away

2099.52 --> 2103.02
from it it's just that

2103.06 --> 2106.14
I don't know

2106.839 --> 2110.82
I just think they do it

2112.0 --> 2118.18
the dark ones go around they plant the

2115.119 --> 2121.42
seeds they turn you either into a [ __ ]

2118.18 --> 2123.2799999999997
or you resist then they like

2121.42 --> 2126.16
let you go

2123.28 --> 2127.96
and then those people start to become

2126.16 --> 2130.92
naturally because of their experience

2127.96 --> 2134.2
pretty high Edge conspiracy theorists

2130.92 --> 2136.06
paranoid probably isolated and then some

2134.2 --> 2137.9199999999996
of them may actually break out of that

2136.06 --> 2140.5
and just

2137.92 --> 2143.46
build something

2140.5 --> 2143.46
bigger

2149.02 --> 2153.04
right

2150.579 --> 2155.98
it doesn't always have to stay under

2153.04 --> 2158.2599999999998
control it's just it starts out like

2155.98 --> 2161.02
that it's like okay let's plant the

2158.26 --> 2162.88
opposition because if they're there and

2161.02 --> 2164.68
they're sort of in a range and in our

2162.88 --> 2168.2200000000003
control then

2164.68 --> 2170.74
others might decline doing that

2168.22 --> 2172.18
naturally truly Grassroots without

2170.74 --> 2175.06
connections

2172.18 --> 2178.359
because there's already somebody out

2175.06 --> 2180.88
there doing it yeah I even think that

2178.359 --> 2182.2599999999998
the whole bunch of flat earthers on the

2180.88 --> 2185.7000000000003
Flat Earth scene

2182.26 --> 2185.7000000000003
are like that too

2189.7 --> 2196.359
somebody dropped it

2192.52 --> 2198.04
in their laps get into some weird Shady

2196.359 --> 2200.02
stuff

2198.04 --> 2204.22
and then they did their own thing with

2200.02 --> 2206.4
it either still connected disconnected

2204.22 --> 2206.3999999999996
foreign

2207.04 --> 2211.359
I mean effectively that's what happened

2209.14 --> 2214.24
with me

2211.359 --> 2217.2
except all these ideas that I thrown out

2214.24 --> 2222.339
especially like holographics yeah

2217.2 --> 2224.2599999999998
nobody told me that yeah no nobody told

2222.339 --> 2229.48
me that

2224.26 --> 2232.7200000000003
no demon Spirit no Dark World Vision

2229.48 --> 2236.68
no Jesuit guy

2232.72 --> 2240.7799999999997
no Jew High priests nothing

2236.68 --> 2245.02
nobody told me that I figured that out

2240.78 --> 2249.099
nobody told me that I figured it out

2245.02 --> 2251.98
yeah all of most the best that got out

2249.099 --> 2255.7200000000003
of them from them from their side is

2251.98 --> 2255.72
discouragement and fair

2256.3 --> 2263.079
didn't understand like even the supposed

2259.859 --> 2265.2999999999997
self-proclaimed dark ones in the shadow

2263.079 --> 2268.3590000000004
Fair did

2265.3 --> 2271.6600000000003
they feared that I completely broke the

2268.359 --> 2273.7
Paradigm that they relied upon

2271.66 --> 2277.7999999999997
to a level that they don't even

2273.7 --> 2277.7999999999997
understand what's going on anymore

oh okay Sigma Lone Wolf

2304.72 --> 2309.52
okay

2307.24 --> 2312.9599999999996
okay fair enough thank you for the

2309.52 --> 2312.96
summary there the BL

2314.44 --> 2319.119
ow everything you said there does seem

2317.079 --> 2321.099
very appealing to me

2319.119 --> 2324.099
however

2321.099 --> 2326.8
am I really that independent am I really

2324.099 --> 2329.02
that self-reliant am I that successful

2326.8 --> 2332.1400000000003
am I really that popular

2329.02 --> 2333.7599999999998
am I really that masculinist

2332.14 --> 2336.8199999999997
I mean

2333.76 --> 2340.8390000000004
I sorted I try

2336.82 --> 2344.7400000000002
but am I really all that I don't know

2340.839 --> 2346.48
is super highly self-criticization part

2344.74 --> 2349.3799999999997
of that list too because then it would

2346.48 --> 2349.38
make perfect sense

2358.18 --> 2360.839
what

2362.5 --> 2367.72
at least the chefs finally freaking

2365.2 --> 2371.16
going and God

2367.72 --> 2371.16
slow start of the day

2375.339 --> 2382.44
yeah PJ CNET I know Alex Dean I know he

2378.94 --> 2382.44
I know what he did

2386.98 --> 2394.42
I think Alex Dean is probably one of

2389.92 --> 2396.76
those actual grass root guys

2394.42 --> 2399.04
he doesn't seem

2396.76 --> 2402.7200000000003
connected

2399.04 --> 2402.72
like to the darkness

2405.579 --> 2409.1400000000003
and he's very wild

2427.72 --> 2434.0789999999997
right so yeah borders boy it's a very

2430.54 --> 2436.18
hyper specific question but yeah I guess

2434.079 --> 2439.42
so

2436.18 --> 2440.98
I imagine if it crafted a metaphysical

2439.42 --> 2444.2200000000003
moral vision

2440.98 --> 2446.38
Liberation and self-realization at the

2444.22 --> 2448.48
court yeah pretty much

2446.38 --> 2452.94
weird thing to hear you say that but

2448.48 --> 2452.94
yeah that is it that's what I'm trying

2458.86 --> 2462.9190000000003
[Music]

2474.4 --> 2479.04
that's a suggesting I'm oh okay fine

2485.8 --> 2492.4
right but I don't think I'm a sigma like

2489.819 --> 2494.94
that then

2492.4 --> 2494.94
because

2498.52 --> 2504.819
it's not like I can't connect

2500.92 --> 2507.839
can absolutely connect I can meld into a

2504.819 --> 2507.839
group it's

2513.04 --> 2518.4
right I'm not permanently isolated like

2516.22 --> 2518.3999999999996
that

2519.22 --> 2527.5
I can lose myself in a group

2523.42 --> 2529.42
almost literally like like that you can

2527.5 --> 2532.48
lose who you are because you're just so

2529.42 --> 2535.14
identifying with the group people

2532.48 --> 2539.36
like I've had that

2535.14 --> 2542.5099999999998
that doesn't seem very Sigma to me

2776.2 --> 2779.859
watch that Gadget inspector I think it's

2778.06 --> 2782.68
kind of a waste of time at this point

2779.859 --> 2785.319
it's meaning like oh yeah oh this

2782.68 --> 2787.06
freaking lying [ __ ] is constantly

2785.319 --> 2789.579
trying to claim like you can see the

it's a complete waste of time

2809.14 --> 2815.859
stupid and in 2017

it's not interesting anymore

2850.98 --> 2857.14
okay well fine borders boy yeah if

2853.96 --> 2860.38
you're gonna take those words

2857.14 --> 2862.5989999999997
in like a devilish perspective lawyer

2860.38 --> 2864.52
speak way yeah then it is just pure

2862.599 --> 2867.579
Satanism yeah

2864.52 --> 2870.46
if you put it in that context

2867.579 --> 2873.3
yeah I get it and I'm not gonna put that

2870.46 --> 2873.3
in that context

2879.7 --> 2884.5789999999997

2891.339 --> 2894.7799999999997
I do what I can

2895.119 --> 2901.8

will not lead me

2902.2 --> 2908.02
to a place that is sustainable the

are you trying to build a case to prove

2968.8 --> 2973.059
that I'm actually a Satanist or

2970.78 --> 2975.46
something because that seems what you're

2973.059 --> 2978.5400000000004

shouldn't shove suggestions of satanism

3090.54 --> 3096.96
in my chat just in between taking a

delivery then

3096.96 --> 3100.5
yeah

3098.16 --> 3102.8999999999996
maybe you should think about what it is

3100.5 --> 3105.319
you're doing while you're doing other

3102.9 --> 3105.319
stuff

3112.8 --> 3117.48

my chat

3117.48 --> 3122.22
borders boy

3119.22 --> 3125.04
are you suggesting that that's what I am

3122.22 --> 3127.3799999999997
is that what you're doing

3125.04 --> 3129.839
are you a little devil persecutor now

3127.38 --> 3132.3
since seeking Star Wars

3129.839 --> 3135.0789999999997
tarot review is that what you are now is

3132.3 --> 3135.079
that what you've become

3150.0 --> 3153.17
[Music]

3161.46 --> 3165.19
asked you two questions well I already

3163.92 --> 3166.98
told you

3165.19 --> 3169.5
[Music]

3166.98 --> 3173.819
I didn't know what it was

3169.5 --> 3176.76
it sucks and the motto the rules

3173.819 --> 3179.52
whatever there's obviously

3176.76 --> 3181.1400000000003
just like liberal Marxist [ __ ] it's

3179.52 --> 3184.02
like oh yeah it sounds really good on

3181.14 --> 3187.02
the surface but we have ways to stretch

3184.02 --> 3189.24
it to infinite like it can be anything

3187.02 --> 3191.7
whatever you want and you basically can

3189.24 --> 3194.339
do whatever the [ __ ] you want do as thou

3191.7 --> 3198.2599999999998
Wilt yeah I know that's what they do is

3194.339 --> 3198.2599999999998
why I find it utterly repulsive

3198.359 --> 3207.42
and I literally want absolutely nothing

3201.9 --> 3211.1600000000003
to do with any of that any of that

3207.42 --> 3211.16
you know burn in hell

[Music]

3261.24 --> 3265.4399999999996
so why are you interested in my view on

3264.24 --> 3268.02
that

3265.44 --> 3270.0
is this the answer you expected is this

3268.02 --> 3272.819
what you wanted to hear

3270.0 --> 3274.68
why did you expect me to know things

3272.819 --> 3277.44
about that

3274.68 --> 3279.4199999999996
why do you even expect me to want to

3277.44 --> 3281.579
know anything about that

3279.42 --> 3284.64
what do you think I need to know

3281.579 --> 3287.3390000000004
everything about it because otherwise it

3284.64 --> 3289.4
might be dangerous no

3287.339 --> 3289.4
no

3290.76 --> 3295.7400000000002
I don't need to know anything about it

3293.339 --> 3298.92
to know that I want to have nothing to

3295.74 --> 3302.299
do with it and that I'm literally just

you can't love an enemy that refuses to

3729.599 --> 3733.6400000000003
love themselves are you dumbass

3736.98 --> 3743.78
and talked about loving his enemies

3739.38 --> 3743.78
that's not what he meant you dumbass

3744.96 --> 3750.119
yeah

3746.22 --> 3753.5389999999998
when you have an apparent enemy

3750.119 --> 3758.039
you have to think of the future and then

3753.539 --> 3760.1600000000003
realize they might not always be your

3758.039 --> 3761.76
enemy

that's

3761.76 --> 3769.1400000000003
what loving your enemies is really about

3764.76 --> 3771.6600000000003
it's about realizing that people change

3769.14 --> 3774.839
that sometimes they'll be your enemy

3771.66 --> 3776.7
because of reasons not because they are

3774.839 --> 3781.14
evil

3776.7 --> 3783.48
and that you if you just act Noble

3781.14 --> 3786.42
and honorable and all that

3783.48 --> 3788.28
they might actually if you have the

3786.42 --> 3791.16
stomach for it

3788.28 --> 3795.6600000000003
be your friends and actually be your

3791.16 --> 3799.319
friends afterward after the situation

3795.66 --> 3801.72
has been resolved yeah that's the real

3799.319 --> 3804.299
lesson it's not oh look at these people

3801.72 --> 3806.4599999999996
that are like possessed by Satan and

3804.299 --> 3808.38
just like don't care about anything just

3806.46 --> 3810.539
want to destroy everything oh we gotta

3808.38 --> 3813.119
love them yeah remember the Good

3810.539 --> 3815.46
Samaritan from The Life of Brian

3813.119 --> 3818.579
I mean he was such a good guy you know

3815.46 --> 3820.68
so he volunteered oh dude let me carry

3818.579 --> 3823.1400000000003
that cross for you

3820.68 --> 3825.68
and then the guy carrying the cross just

3823.14 --> 3825.68
walked away

3825.78 --> 3829.799
yeah

3827.16 --> 3832.2
that's what you are

3829.799 --> 3836.28
a dumbass because you don't understand

3832.2 --> 3839.0989999999997
what's going on and how things work then

3836.28 --> 3840.9
if that's what you want

3839.099 --> 3843.799
if you want to love your enemies

3840.9 --> 3843.799
literally

3845.52 --> 3850.319
pray for those that persecute you yeah

3847.319 --> 3852.119
yeah you can do that

3850.319 --> 3854.0389999999998
that's fine right

3852.119 --> 3856.5
but it only works if you actually

3854.039 --> 3858.42
understand them right

3856.5 --> 3860.76
it's like this

3858.42 --> 3862.859
love thy enemies pray for them yeah

3860.76 --> 3865.76
because they don't realize you're not

3862.859 --> 3865.7599999999998
really their enemy

3866.46 --> 3871.619
it's about long-term

3868.5 --> 3873.78
strategical thinking people change

3871.619 --> 3875.039
people may become enemies and then

3873.78 --> 3877.6800000000003
friends

3875.039 --> 3880.559
just because somebody is your enemy at

3877.68 --> 3881.94
some point doesn't make you

3880.559 --> 3884.88
need

3881.94 --> 3886.94
to like keep them in the enemy and

3884.88 --> 3890.2200000000003
finish them off

3886.94 --> 3893.46
that's the real Point Jesus was making

3890.22 --> 3897.0
is not to love everything that's

3893.46 --> 3899.76
[ __ ] that makes no sense

3897.0 --> 3903.9
it's just that some people are not your

3899.76 --> 3907.38
enemy they just think they're your enemy

3903.9 --> 3910.7400000000002
do something with that right make them

3907.38 --> 3914.0
realize they're not your enemy

3910.74 --> 3914.0
that's the real trick

3920.94 --> 3924.079
hello Stephanie

3924.66 --> 3928.94
or Jesus quotes I see

3943.559 --> 3949.8590000000004
that you're a fool borders boy

3947.4 --> 3953.579
I mean you really want to know

3949.859 --> 3955.92
everything about Hillary Clinton too

3953.579 --> 3958.319
is that your favorite thing to know

3955.92 --> 3960.48
everything about I mean that that's

3958.319 --> 3961.68
pretty good example of a Satanist right

3960.48 --> 3965.28
there

3961.68 --> 3966.48
so you're gonna do that all day then

3965.28 --> 3968.2200000000003
this is

3966.48 --> 3973.16
what's the point

3968.22 --> 3973.16
look up Don't Look Down

3977.539 --> 3985.98
right if they are directly attacking you

3983.46 --> 3988.68
yeah and get to know your enemy

3985.98 --> 3990.599
see how they're attacking you you

3988.68 --> 3994.0789999999997
and then you'll find out that most of

3990.599 --> 3997.44
them are just making you attack yourself

3994.079 --> 3999.7200000000003
so non-engagement is always the best

3997.44 --> 4001.64
strategy

3999.72 --> 4004.339
when it comes to that sort of thing with

4001.64 --> 4009.7599999999998
the darkness and evil and Satanism

4004.339 --> 4009.7599999999998
you don't need to know them

4026.24 --> 4030.5
yeah that's nice Gadget inspector little

4028.64 --> 4033.68
birdie nests yeah I think that the

4030.5 --> 4038.2
jackdaw also have a little

4033.68 --> 4038.2
birdie in there by now

4050.42 --> 4055.099
yeah so borders boy you do what you want

4053.059 --> 4056.3590000000004
I'm not interested and I'm not gonna

4055.099 --> 4059.2000000000003
feed

4056.359 --> 4059.2
you

4059.78 --> 4066.98
under on the angle of approach of your

4063.5 --> 4070.339
interest in Crowley yeah

4066.98 --> 4072.76
you want to do that you want to put want

4070.339 --> 4075.2599999999998
to put your foot in that poisoned water

4072.76 --> 4078.2200000000003
you go and do that

4075.26 --> 4078.2200000000003
but not here

4078.74 --> 4085.0989999999997
you go dive in their mindset think how

4081.98 --> 4087.26
they can be as [ __ ] up as they are you

4085.099 --> 4089.3590000000004
go and resonate your frequency because

4087.26 --> 4091.6400000000003
you won't understand it so much you go

4089.359 --> 4094.0989999999997
and do that yeah I'm not gonna do that

4091.64 --> 4096.7
I'm not gonna help you do that

4094.099 --> 4096.7
all right

4131.839 --> 4135.759
who are you talking to Stephanie

4141.5 --> 4143.739
foreign

4156.08 --> 4161.0
do I believe in Jesus I know Jesus

4158.54 --> 4164.06
existed

4161.0 --> 4166.819
I follow his path

4164.06 --> 4169.42
I hate his lessons

4166.819 --> 4169.42
yeah

4171.679 --> 4179.859
but I don't believe in things

4175.339 --> 4179.859
I only trust that which I know

4183.569 --> 4186.749000000001
[Music]

4191.719 --> 4198.5
I'm definitely not gonna believe Jesus

4195.58 --> 4201.28
is the father and the Son and the Holy

4198.5 --> 4205.219
Ghost and all that garbage Trinity

4201.28 --> 4209.0199999999995
[ __ ] priesthood dwelling route yeah

4205.219 --> 4209.02
I'm not gonna go there at all

4210.26 --> 4214.88
he's a prophet for sure in the biblical

4213.62 --> 4217.699
tradition

4214.88 --> 4219.400000000001
and I think he was the best of us want

4217.699 --> 4223.339999999999
the best

4219.4 --> 4225.799999999999
examples of how to be in an incredibly

4223.34 --> 4228.9400000000005
early era

4225.8 --> 4232.9400000000005
and he's been endlessly

4228.94 --> 4232.94
manipulated afterwards

4233.42 --> 4238.4
everything that surrounds him has been

4236.3 --> 4239.96
Tinker tailored

4238.4 --> 4242.78
to

4239.96 --> 4246.14
like take away some of that seemingly

4242.78 --> 4249.44
endless amount of power and force you to

4246.14 --> 4251.54
reinterpret it in a very specific way so

4249.44 --> 4254.36
that you actually get stuck and can't

4251.54 --> 4257.56
just do what he says

4254.36 --> 4257.5599999999995
that's what I think

4258.56 --> 4264.820000000001
how do you know Jesus existed

4261.739 --> 4264.82
because I know

4269.659 --> 4274.339999999999
I know we existed

4272.42 --> 4277.2390000000005
seen him

4274.34 --> 4277.2390000000005
talk to him

4279.14 --> 4284.84
and the words he said

4282.739 --> 4289.0
can that

4284.84 --> 4289.0
nobody can just make that up

4290.12 --> 4297.76
there's too much detail about it

4293.96 --> 4297.76
has to be from a real person

4302.12 --> 4307.28
I think that the entire story in the

4304.58 --> 4309.86
Bible was Rewritten

4307.28 --> 4313.4
for political reasons all kinds of

4309.86 --> 4314.9
reasons around Jesus to make everything

4313.4 --> 4317.12
different but I think that everything

4314.9 --> 4320.839999999999
that was said by him

4317.12 --> 4324.82
he literally has said in the real world

4320.84 --> 4324.82
and it was written down

4325.1 --> 4330.26
so everything that is said by Jesus in

4327.8 --> 4331.76
the Bible is literally real that's what

4330.26 --> 4333.92
I believe

4331.76 --> 4336.56
just believe that the entire story of

4333.92 --> 4339.52
the Bible was like a theatrical

4336.56 --> 4339.52
rewriting

4339.739 --> 4344.959999999999
with political influences and all kinds

4342.44 --> 4346.099999999999
of [ __ ] and those in Jerusalem no it's

4344.96 --> 4348.86
not

4346.1 --> 4353.179
what's in southern France

4348.86 --> 4356.199
also Jesus was a ginger and he was heir

4353.179 --> 4356.1990000000005
to the throne of Rome

4357.679 --> 4363.58
and it was a nobleman

4359.9 --> 4363.58
not a poor bastard

4364.1 --> 4369.34
and everything he says fits that still

4371.179 --> 4376.4
like in my Dark World Vision like in my

4374.0 --> 4379.76
biggest Vision yeah I saw Jesus it was

4376.4 --> 4381.92
really weird because I didn't even fully

4379.76 --> 4384.4400000000005
understand him back then

4381.92 --> 4386.12
so I didn't even give him like the

4384.44 --> 4389.719
proper respect

4386.12 --> 4392.659
I did to a certain degree is just not

4389.719 --> 4395.2390000000005
I have much more in all of them now than

4392.659 --> 4397.58
it was back then when I actually met him

4395.239 --> 4401.86
in that vision

4397.58 --> 4401.86
by the way I also freaking met Buddha

4402.4 --> 4405.509999999999
[Music]

4406.1 --> 4409.46
that was even a weirder experience

4407.719 --> 4413.02
because that wasn't in a dark World

4409.46 --> 4417.14
Vision that was in a waking vision

4413.02 --> 4419.8
very very special moment

4417.14 --> 4419.8
uh

4426.8 --> 4430.9400000000005
all right but my vision whenever seeing

4429.38 --> 4431.659000000001
him meeting him that's not even what I

4430.94 --> 4435.08
mean

4431.659 --> 4437.48
I know he exists

4435.08 --> 4441.32
just can't

4437.48 --> 4442.94
I can't reveal how I know I know he

4441.32 --> 4444.98
exists

4442.94 --> 4447.62
I know it

4444.98 --> 4450.98
can't explain it it's not believing

4447.62 --> 4453.92
because I'm not like oh okay I have to

4450.98 --> 4456.199
no I know it I just know it and nobody's

4453.92 --> 4457.58
gonna tell me any different this is not

4456.199 --> 4460.099999999999
about believing it's not about

4457.58 --> 4463.699
submitting it's not about

4460.1 --> 4466.58
like self-delusion I know he exists and

4463.699 --> 4469.639999999999
existed and that is real it's real it's

4466.58 --> 4472.5199999999995
still there The Echoes of his existence

4469.64 --> 4475.52
are still there in the spirit realm

4472.52 --> 4478.1
everything was shaped around what he is

4475.52 --> 4482.620000000001
what he said

4478.1 --> 4482.620000000001
he has to have existed

4491.54 --> 4494.62
shut up

4554.719 --> 4559.04
that's right clutch

4556.58 --> 4562.159
exactly

4559.04 --> 4564.92
people are still gamma squirting over

4562.159 --> 4567.28
something a man said over 2 000 years

4564.92 --> 4567.28
ago

4603.38 --> 4609.5
right the thing was

4605.96 --> 4613.659
I always knew juices existed I just

4609.5 --> 4613.659
didn't see his importance at first

4614.659 --> 4618.94
it's like his wisdom just

4619.28 --> 4626.0
wasn't able to sink deep enough into me

4622.94 --> 4628.599999999999
to for me to be able to recognize its

4626.0 --> 4628.6
awesome power

4628.82 --> 4634.099999999999
of God I just didn't see it I always

4632.54 --> 4636.14
thought it was real I just thought it

4634.1 --> 4637.9400000000005
was like overrated and [ __ ] when I was

4636.14 --> 4639.92
younger really

4637.94 --> 4641.36
just thought it's overrated just look at

4639.92 --> 4642.9800000000005
all these Christians they're just a

4641.36 --> 4645.86
bunch of idiots

4642.98 --> 4649.82
so how can Jesus be all that great then

4645.86 --> 4653.259999999999
if all these Christians are just idiots

4649.82 --> 4653.259999999999
don't know what the hell they're doing

4654.5 --> 4658.64
and like they don't correct each other's

4656.84 --> 4661.659000000001
terrible behavior and all that right

4658.64 --> 4661.659000000001
mostly that

4666.8 --> 4673.46
how did he appear look in my vision

4671.3 --> 4676.179
it was weird it was kind of a

4673.46 --> 4676.179
holographic

4676.34 --> 4683.3
thing

4678.26 --> 4684.7390000000005
it was I think how it the how it was

4683.3 --> 4687.679
shown was like

4684.739 --> 4691.4
what's that famous dome painting from

4687.679 --> 4693.679
Leonardo da Vinci with God and Jesus on

4691.4 --> 4697.5199999999995
the other side touching fingers

4693.679 --> 4698.3
it was basically like a 3D version of

4697.52 --> 4701.84
that

4698.3 --> 4705.9800000000005
that I was facing

4701.84 --> 4708.38
and it was like it detached and Jesus

4705.98 --> 4711.62
then was like accepted

4708.38 --> 4713.06
dude Dark World man it's freaking weird

4711.62 --> 4715.82
how that works

4713.06 --> 4716.84
yeah the 16th chapel the Sistine Chapel

4715.82 --> 4720.199
yeah yeah

4716.84 --> 4723.679
it seemed like the original

4720.199 --> 4725.419999999999
seed for the Dark Worlds holographic

4723.679 --> 4727.52
simulation that was part of that

4725.42 --> 4729.4400000000005
experience was derived from the Sistine

4727.52 --> 4733.42
Chapel that's right

4729.44 --> 4733.419999999999
said God and Adam ah

4734.78 --> 4741.04
well I did not know that

4737.199 --> 4741.04
I thought it was Jesus

4742.58 --> 4745.36
so

4745.4 --> 4749.719
I displaced it right that's that's the

4748.58 --> 4753.14
thing about

4749.719 --> 4757.82
all the graphics of your mind if I

4753.14 --> 4760.52
didn't know that then to me it was Jesus

4757.82 --> 4762.139999999999
and that's how my mind treated it in the

4760.52 --> 4764.2390000000005
experience

4762.14 --> 4767.6
sorry

4764.239 --> 4770.239
sorry my internal experience got the

4767.6 --> 4774.280000000001
details wrong

4770.239 --> 4774.28
there's not a lot I can do about it now

4777.5 --> 4779.679
foreign

4788.92 --> 4795.32
but one thing about the entire Christian

4791.96 --> 4798.08
part of like Jesus is that I'm always I

4795.32 --> 4799.46
was always repulsed like heavily

4798.08 --> 4802.219
repulsed

4799.46 --> 4804.199
by this constant like putting Jesus on

4802.219 --> 4808.34
the cross and oh look at him suffer for

4804.199 --> 4810.62
us oh it's I hate it I've always hated

4808.34 --> 4813.679
it I even questioned like

4810.62 --> 4818.62
they're just using you like a sacrifice

4813.679 --> 4818.62
victim Jesus why are you doing this

4819.98 --> 4826.159
why are you letting this all happen

4823.699 --> 4827.96
when you're just going to be used by

4826.159 --> 4831.799999999999
satanists that think that they're

4827.96 --> 4834.139
Christians like gloating over you as a

4831.8 --> 4836.12
sacrifice victim

4834.139 --> 4839.3
so they can do whatever the [ __ ] they

4836.12 --> 4842.48
want how are you accepting how is this

4839.3 --> 4844.58
your future how is this your magnificent

4842.48 --> 4846.82
plan that's basically what I faced him

4844.58 --> 4846.82
with

4849.56 --> 4855.4400000000005
and he was seemingly a bit insulted and

4853.28 --> 4856.759999999999
just said like yeah you just don't

4855.44 --> 4859.78
understand

4856.76 --> 4859.780000000001
you'll see

4882.739 --> 4888.919999999999
you what I just want to talk about Satan

4886.1 --> 4891.820000000001
when it seems he did dropped out about

4888.92 --> 4891.82
Jesus yeah

4897.38 --> 4903.26
it is a bit weird isn't it Rufus now I

4900.02 --> 4905.6
did treat him very harshly in a way

4903.26 --> 4908.719
what with good reason it's not like I

4905.6 --> 4911.6
took his wrench away randomly

4908.719 --> 4914.84
the way he approached me that day was

4911.6 --> 4916.820000000001
just like that's

4914.84 --> 4919.46
well it's kind of what happened to Dutch

4916.82 --> 4920.9
sailor and he's no longer here not

4919.46 --> 4922.4
because he's banned but because he

4920.9 --> 4924.799999999999
doesn't want to be here anymore he's

4922.4 --> 4926.839999999999
gone full savonia I think that Porter's

4924.8 --> 4928.820000000001
boy may have just contracted full

4926.84 --> 4932.9800000000005
savonier syndrome

4928.82 --> 4932.98
he seems to have hit this weird note

4933.44 --> 4938.78
and

4936.199 --> 4943.159
not good

4938.78 --> 4946.5199999999995
yeah but I'm right am I not Rufus and

4943.159 --> 4948.44
hobbins like what I said I put the D to

4946.52 --> 4951.8
the word right

4948.44 --> 4954.32
I don't care about these stupid little

4951.8 --> 4956.0
Satanist group I don't care about them I

4954.32 --> 4957.62
don't care about how they do it what

4956.0 --> 4960.139
they think the principle I don't give a

4957.62 --> 4962.179
[ __ ] Rock in hell

4960.139 --> 4965.0
rotten hell until you're forgotten I

4962.179 --> 4965.84
don't give a [ __ ] what you do what you

4965.0 --> 4967.699
did

4965.84 --> 4969.26
nothing about it is important to

4967.699 --> 4973.46
anything

4969.26 --> 4977.719
yeah I care about Jesus I care about

4973.46 --> 4977.719
important people magnificence

4978.92 --> 4983.96
that's what I bring up that's what I

4981.62 --> 4986.48
start talking about don't I

4983.96 --> 4989.7390000000005
not the shitty people

4986.48 --> 4989.739
the good things

4991.88 --> 5005.56
[Music]

5002.26 --> 5008.34
uh I'm not gonna explain it now it's a

5005.56 --> 5008.34
Fournier syndrome

5009.97 --> 5013.06
[Music]

5020.739 --> 5025.959999999999
should talk about Jesus not Satan well

5023.02 --> 5028.2390000000005
not necessary bit over generalized but

5025.96 --> 5030.159
yeah it's not like oh you have to talk

5028.239 --> 5034.48
about Jesus all the time it's just like

5030.159 --> 5037.96
the good good things good people people

5034.48 --> 5039.159
in Ascension magnificence

5037.96 --> 5043.12
like

5039.159 --> 5045.58
study magnificence study Ascension see

5043.12 --> 5049.84
how things change for the better

5045.58 --> 5050.92
understand it and then you move closer

5049.84 --> 5053.7390000000005
to it

5050.92 --> 5055.96
if you study the darkness oh you think

5053.739 --> 5057.5199999999995
oh then I'll be so much better than the

5055.96 --> 5059.7390000000005
darkness and I'm protected from the

5057.52 --> 5062.02
darkness oh no no actually you learn

5059.739 --> 5064.599999999999
everything about it and now you know

5062.02 --> 5066.9400000000005
dark things that if you hadn't learned

5064.6 --> 5069.1
anything about them you wouldn't even

5066.94 --> 5072.4
know and now you have those things with

5069.1 --> 5075.120000000001
you carrying with you like junk dragging

5072.4 --> 5078.159
behind you now is it gonna drag you down

5075.12 --> 5081.099999999999
literally in the spiritual realm it's

5078.159 --> 5082.9
gonna drag you down yeah and before you

5081.1 --> 5087.84
know it

5082.9 --> 5087.839999999999
you basically surrendered to weakness

5089.08 --> 5093.159
study

5091.0 --> 5095.139
evil

5093.159 --> 5098.04

5161.55 --> 5164.689
[Music]

5180.94 --> 5185.32
no it borders boy did not draw a card

5183.46 --> 5187.9
clutch borders boy

5185.32 --> 5190.239
when was that seeking's hello seeking

5187.9 --> 5191.32
Star Wars if she's here

5190.239 --> 5193.839999999999
right

5191.32 --> 5196.739
now it's just that that show we were

5193.84 --> 5200.139
doing that he was like oh Jesus said

5196.739 --> 5202.299999999999
never Divine anything or something I

5200.139 --> 5205.12
don't know paraphrasing and it's just

5202.3 --> 5208.54
like dude what the [ __ ]

5205.12 --> 5211.36
and ever since it's just been this

5208.54 --> 5214.36
is just turn around

5211.36 --> 5216.339999999999
I mean your energy was great borders boy

5214.36 --> 5219.339999999999
you've asked some really good question

5216.34 --> 5222.58
in exactly the right times in the last

5219.34 --> 5226.06
half year I'd say but ever since that

5222.58 --> 5228.76
seeking Star Wars show about dude

5226.06 --> 5231.76
there's something wrong with you

5228.76 --> 5231.76
foreign

5240.34 --> 5244.7390000000005
yeah exactly what seeking star would

5242.44 --> 5244.739
have said

5246.82 --> 5251.139
understanding your enemies is a big part

5248.86 --> 5254.0199999999995
of warfare oh really so

5251.139 --> 5258.0
what is boy so you're gonna do Warfare

5254.02 --> 5258.0
then are you going to do Warfare

5258.1 --> 5262.3
on the satanists

5260.199 --> 5265.54
how are you gonna do that

5262.3 --> 5267.9400000000005
because Warfare usually means

5265.54 --> 5270.639
engaging

5267.94 --> 5273.099999999999
so are you doing that

5270.639 --> 5274.36
you're gonna engage

5273.1 --> 5277.120000000001
are you

5274.36 --> 5279.159
what's your plan

5277.12 --> 5280.96
how are you planning to

5279.159 --> 5284.879999999999
wage war

5280.96 --> 5284.88
on the satanists then

5285.159 --> 5288.78
I don't think you thought this through

5294.34 --> 5297.88
you expressed your view on divination

5296.56 --> 5301.06
well yeah

5297.88 --> 5303.1
and I explained my view on divination

5301.06 --> 5305.56
and what I think that Jesus meant with

5303.1 --> 5308.92
that when putting it into context and

5305.56 --> 5312.6990000000005
I'm still open to debate about it as in

5308.92 --> 5315.28
hello everybody on the internet every

5312.699 --> 5318.339999999999
single actual person

5315.28 --> 5320.44
right I am open to have like an

5318.34 --> 5322.2390000000005
hour-long face-to-face over camera

5320.44 --> 5324.58
discussion

5322.239 --> 5328.0
about that

5324.58 --> 5330.94
and deep study like deep study about

5328.0 --> 5333.1
where in the Bible did he say that what

5330.94 --> 5335.32
is the context who were these

5333.1 --> 5337.84
astrologers who were the diviners what

5335.32 --> 5340.9
was divining back then exactly and get

5337.84 --> 5342.159000000001
it completely down

5340.9 --> 5345.339999999999
right

5342.159 --> 5347.08
nobody's really stepped up to me yet I

5345.34 --> 5349.96
did talk to my dad over the phone about

5347.08 --> 5353.0199999999995
it and funnily enough he

5349.96 --> 5354.82
he actually agreed

5353.02 --> 5356.860000000001
on first glance even though he

5354.82 --> 5360.54
recognized he gave recognition that I

5356.86 --> 5360.54
don't really know everything about it

5360.58 --> 5365.98
and then he compared it to

5363.219 --> 5369.52
Rudolph Steiner's teachings which really

5365.98 --> 5372.04
does support my angle of approach

5369.52 --> 5374.080000000001
like it's a risk it's a power it's a

5372.04 --> 5377.199
risk because of the power like are you

5374.08 --> 5380.199
going to over focus on the Divination

5377.199 --> 5382.419999999999
then you take away focus on where you

5380.199 --> 5384.5199999999995
are here right now in your life and your

5382.42 --> 5386.02
own physical senses

5384.52 --> 5389.8
like that

5386.02 --> 5391.900000000001
so yeah I got a lot of reason to take

5389.8 --> 5394.54
that stance

5391.9 --> 5397.48
based on personal experience throughout

5394.54 --> 5400.12
my life when I'm definitely willing to

5397.48 --> 5402.94
further explore it with somebody that's

5400.12 --> 5405.219
like biblically backed

5402.94 --> 5406.839999999999
that really has done deeper research

5405.219 --> 5409.6
that now is a lot of detail and

5406.84 --> 5411.639
background stuff all that and that is

5409.6 --> 5413.88
still just a decent human being and not

5411.639 --> 5417.06
just there the devil persecute

5413.88 --> 5420.159000000001
divination or something because they are

5417.06 --> 5422.26
obsessed with that it's supposedly evil

5420.159 --> 5423.94
right I'm very willing to have a

5422.26 --> 5427.679
discussion like that but not today

5423.94 --> 5427.678999999999
because now I'm rounding out the show

5428.26 --> 5435.179
don't I fear the wrath of Jesus

5431.56 --> 5435.179
no he's dead

5435.42 --> 5440.56
yeah you might have heard

5438.58 --> 5443.98
right

5440.56 --> 5447.88
do I fear the wrath of God oh yeah

5443.98 --> 5451.86
but I know how the wrath of God works

5447.88 --> 5451.86
yeah all his rules

5452.199 --> 5457.599999999999
yeah that's not oh and then after you

5455.5 --> 5460.48
die that's when you get to pay the price

5457.6 --> 5462.9400000000005
that's a very popular way of thinking

5460.48 --> 5464.199
that was invented by priests no I

5462.94 --> 5469.48
believe

5464.199 --> 5470.799999999999
in all the price is here in life in how

5469.48 --> 5476.099999999999
things work

5470.8 --> 5476.1
if you sin you paid the price in life

5477.58 --> 5483.94
you understand and it's complicated it

5480.699 --> 5487.659
all is very complicated God is extremely

5483.94 --> 5490.0599999999995
forgiving and dynamic but the price is

5487.659 --> 5492.94
always the price the weight

5490.06 --> 5495.820000000001
of the darkness is always the weight of

5492.94 --> 5499.0
the darkness that can't change it's just

5495.82 --> 5501.94
how the price is then paid how your life

5499.0 --> 5503.38
changes and flows into what it becomes

5501.94 --> 5507.36
changes

5503.38 --> 5507.36
yeah that's how I see it

5507.58 --> 5512.0199999999995
price of sin is death

5510.1 --> 5513.58
what does that mean does that mean oh

5512.02 --> 5516.280000000001
there is a man that's going to then

5513.58 --> 5519.219
Slaughter you well it might

5516.28 --> 5520.96
if you keep piling and piling and piling

5519.219 --> 5523.4800000000005
and piling those sins and you have

5520.96 --> 5525.88
absolutely no regard for God or the

5523.48 --> 5528.099999999999
rules or other people then it's very

5525.88 --> 5530.62
likely that at some point a person is

5528.1 --> 5532.179
gonna come with a sure assorted chop

5530.62 --> 5537.78
your head off

5532.179 --> 5537.78
yeah that's prices for the the wages

5538.06 --> 5544.3
the price for sin is death see this is

5542.32 --> 5546.469999999999
how I

5544.3 --> 5549.589
how I

5546.47 --> 5549.589
[Music]

5601.6 --> 5606.3
the hell is going on with this [ __ ]

5604.06 --> 5606.3
mic

5607.54 --> 5614.5199999999995
in the middle of an explanation God damn

5610.9 --> 5614.5199999999995
it you [ __ ] technology

5620.8 --> 5625.84
right my point is

5623.62 --> 5628.54
afterlife you get confronted with

5625.84 --> 5630.9400000000005
everything you postponed

5628.54 --> 5633.5199999999995
from your Consciousness and in that

5630.94 --> 5636.638999999999
sense yeah

5633.52 --> 5641.34
after your life you pay for your sin as

5636.639 --> 5641.34
well literally that also happens

5641.679 --> 5647.86
but it's already there during

5646.719 --> 5650.32
yeah

5647.86 --> 5653.5
you can collect

5650.32 --> 5655.32
the payment for your sin within your

5653.5 --> 5657.12
life

5655.32 --> 5660.82
Redemption

5657.12 --> 5663.699
acceptance of the rules and the

5660.82 --> 5665.38
consequences if you oversimplify that is

5663.699 --> 5667.48
all going to come after death how is

5665.38 --> 5668.4400000000005
that going to change what you do it

5667.48 --> 5670.718999999999
won't

5668.44 --> 5674.638999999999
it only changes when you realize that

5670.719 --> 5678.639
the price for sin is in your life

5674.639 --> 5681.46
immediately it's right there it changes

5678.639 --> 5684.54
you in a way that you probably did not

5681.46 --> 5687.82
foresee it tends to do that every time

5684.54 --> 5693.159
and that's the price

5687.82 --> 5695.5
that is the price it's in your life

5693.159 --> 5698.199
and after your death arguably as well

5695.5 --> 5700.42
but it is already there in your life

5698.199 --> 5703.299999999999
it's not a myth it's not oh it's all

5700.42 --> 5706.84
tied into this belief that after that no

5703.3 --> 5709.54
no it's right there it's right there in

5706.84 --> 5711.28
your face the sin the price for it it's

5709.54 --> 5714.639
right there that's how it's even

5711.28 --> 5716.5599999999995
identified as a sin if there was no

5714.639 --> 5719.139
price how would we know it was a sin

5716.56 --> 5721.900000000001
because somebody said it once well guess

5719.139 --> 5725.5
what there's a lot of people that have

5721.9 --> 5728.32
said things once a lot billions of

5725.5 --> 5731.739
people that have said things once yeah

5728.32 --> 5735.099999999999
they don't tend to stick unless it's

5731.739 --> 5736.659
real unless it's palpable it's provable

5735.1 --> 5738.88
it's empirical

5736.659 --> 5743.379999999999
yeah sin

5738.88 --> 5744.6990000000005
the price to me is empirical it's right

5743.38 --> 5747.4800000000005
there

5744.699 --> 5747.48
it happens

5747.82 --> 5752.739
right but I'm running out now so thanks
