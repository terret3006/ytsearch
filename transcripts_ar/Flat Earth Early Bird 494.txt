64.6 --> 73.02
much appreciated

65.68 --> 76.15
so today the weather is incredible

73.02 --> 79.72
probably the most beautiful day I've

76.15 --> 81.759
seen this year so far fortunately

79.72 --> 86.05
somebody decided to make an incredible

81.759 --> 88.619
amount of very annoying noise with some

86.05 --> 88.619
machine out there

93.6 --> 101.82
it's like a spotless flawless blue sky

98.57 --> 106.44
can you conceive it move over there pick

101.82 --> 108.53999999999999
this up and it's just Sun and no wind

106.44 --> 112.14
that's the big thing there's suddenly

108.54 --> 117.18
finally no freakin wind so it's actually

112.14 --> 123.509
really warm outside brilliantly except

117.18 --> 124.02000000000001
for the freakin noise Oh such beautiful

123.509 --> 126.539
weather

124.02 --> 129.03
yeah a great idea to go and work outside

126.539 --> 131.31
and make incredible noise that the

129.03 --> 138.45
entire neighborhood has to then enjoy

131.31 --> 149.12
with them Thanks yeah lovely everybody

138.45 --> 152.98899999999998
bring out your finally stuff like this

149.12 --> 157.26
anyway yeah it was funny I noticed that

152.989 --> 161.45000000000002
the Sun is still getting inside the

157.26 --> 163.92
angle of it that's that's been a while

161.45 --> 166.79899999999998
since I started to show and there was

163.92 --> 170.32899999999998
still actual some visible heading like

166.799 --> 175.59
the chair and stuff but yeah it's there

170.329 --> 180.18
so springtime is coming or it is here

175.59 --> 182.25
pretty much let's see was in chat okay

180.18 --> 186.829
more colored was first over McCool

182.25 --> 191.91
Amanda young Patricia Dockery said it

186.829 --> 194.36
Sarita Cosentino Robin Stanley mark

191.91 --> 194.35999999999999
colored

195.75 --> 203.88
am i okay Steve yeah good to see you all

201.41 --> 207.65
don't forget to share the show right

203.88 --> 210.82999999999998
it's more important than ever

207.65 --> 210.83
what's that

218.569 --> 221.14
what

221.94 --> 231.63
oh damn it not again

225.27 --> 233.69
Oh 5g our towers being installed oh

231.63 --> 236.69
goody

233.69 --> 236.69
yeah

243.5 --> 252.93
yeah I just got a Papa from some ranty

246.84 --> 253.709
video anyway yeah I got green tea with

252.93 --> 263.66
me that's it

253.709 --> 263.66
by the way hey you getting sick

272.279 --> 285.239
ya know I feel pretty good today had an

277.379 --> 289.04900000000004
OK night rest oh yeah was pretty late

285.239 --> 293.729
though because yeah Oh Benjamin like

289.049 --> 299.06899999999996
very late and it was good it was fun

293.729 --> 301.25899999999996
again it's interesting because seems

299.069 --> 305.699
that the Big Bear is also reading up on

301.259 --> 309.779
his alternative medical insights so he's

305.699 --> 314.339
now apparently confident enough to just

309.779 --> 317.759
say that he's yeah that he's not fully

314.339 --> 320.749
down with the germ theory and that's

317.759 --> 327.899
yeah it's interesting to see somebody a

320.749 --> 329.42900000000003
bigger player like that do that like

327.899 --> 332.039
when I kind of brought this kind of

329.429 --> 334.649
thing forth it kind of it unnerved me so

332.039 --> 337.979
you might have noticed that it was like

334.649 --> 340.049
am I allowed to talk about this like is

337.979 --> 344.639
it okay yet I know it's kind of in the

340.049 --> 349.10999999999996
open but yeah I barely heard anybody

344.639 --> 350.879
talk about it and guess what now I don't

349.11 --> 353.159
know if it comes if it was coming

350.879 --> 355.769
through me or if it was just general

353.159 --> 359.759
that people were kind of waiting for the

355.769 --> 366.599
moment to do that to bring that out but

359.759 --> 371.939
yeah there is now a yeah a wider doubt

366.599 --> 373.949
concerning these medical issues in well

371.939 --> 375.98900000000003
in the conspiracy theories seem that

373.949 --> 376.499
everybody's just blatantly denying

375.989 --> 379.049
everything

376.499 --> 381.029
maybe but yeah that's because probably

379.049 --> 385.75899999999996
medical things are relatively

381.029 --> 389.36899999999997
complicated so most people just try to

385.759 --> 392.639
kind of extract it maybe yeah a simpler

389.369 --> 397.09900000000005
version of it and then forward that you

392.639 --> 400.51
know that's what typical people do but

397.099 --> 403.26
yeah there's also

400.51 --> 406.21
yeah there's just a lot of interest in

403.26 --> 408.7
in the medical details of this and like

406.21 --> 411.07
what is it and they know of course the

408.7 --> 413.89
Guru know what is it you know but then

411.07 --> 416.59
also just side tracks like hey where

413.89 --> 420.12
does this all come from and basically

416.59 --> 420.11999999999995
what's really going down in the world

442.49 --> 445.49
hmm

449.38 --> 455.8
all right yeah and it's it seemed to

453.04 --> 458.77000000000004
have basically penetrated the mind of

455.8 --> 462.52000000000004
the Netherlands as well because the

458.77 --> 464.74
Netherlands TV is Ferdinand status it so

462.52 --> 467.53
it's it's almost like the Democratic

464.74 --> 473.35
Party in the United States except by

467.53 --> 476.14
more subtle a lot more so but there's

473.35 --> 480.09000000000003
plenty of people here that are kind of

476.14 --> 486.03999999999996
dove into the conspiracy mindset and

480.09 --> 487.98999999999995
yeah it's so typical just people come to

486.04 --> 490.33000000000004
the same conclusions looking over the

487.99 --> 494.02
same data it's just that's that's

490.33 --> 497.53
logical but it still kind of surprises

494.02 --> 500.16999999999996
me to see it's almost like sometimes I

497.53 --> 503.59
go on my own little discovery route and

500.17 --> 507.01
then I kind of underestimate other

503.59 --> 509.56
people I guess and then to just see like

507.01 --> 512.289
oh yeah they they figured it out as well

509.56 --> 515.74
and I'm like yeah actually I shouldn't

512.289 --> 521.41
really be that surprised but sometimes I

515.74 --> 525.79
still am that it's just so many people

521.41 --> 527.89
now catching on to the hype of the

525.79 --> 530.98
outbreak and how media is seems to be

527.89 --> 533.43
lying about the numbers and showing well

530.98 --> 538.4200000000001
I can't say it any other way

533.43 --> 541.8399999999999
like crisis acts acts very much an act

538.42 --> 545.29
and maybe with actual sick people

541.84 --> 548.4300000000001
participating in those crisis act as if

545.29 --> 553.51
they were coronavirus patients but

548.43 --> 555.8199999999999
they're probably not and this just this

553.51 --> 558.28
dissing thing going on this is a crisis

555.82 --> 563.2
act concerning them they had a medical

558.28 --> 565.05
system it's odd it's odd like that they

563.2 --> 568.99
would go that far

565.05 --> 570.9399999999999
because what's gonna happen all of this

568.99 --> 572.6800000000001
is already kind of shining through so

570.94 --> 576.58
all these people that are part of this

572.68 --> 578.77
is like yeah they're gonna be it's gonna

576.58 --> 582.259
be known eventually that they all did

578.77 --> 585.2289999999999
that so why do they do it

582.259 --> 591.559
what do they hope to accomplish by going

585.229 --> 594.0790000000001
along with all this and why why would

591.559 --> 600.249
they think it would be worth it to do

594.079 --> 600.2489999999999
that the crisis Act this thing like that

603.069 --> 609.949
you know is there some well there is

606.199 --> 612.709
political moving goals like society

609.949 --> 615.5889999999999
different countries are trying to move

612.709 --> 619.0999999999999
the bar politically again trying to yeah

615.589 --> 623.869
get through upgrades of the police state

619.1 --> 626.299
type activities role changes more

623.869 --> 629.229
control it is being kind of forced upon

626.299 --> 631.459
every country in one way or the other

629.229 --> 635.4490000000001
through different angles through their

631.459 --> 637.16
political players and in my opinion are

635.449 --> 639.1089999999999
all part of the New World Order it's

637.16 --> 641.929
like right hand left hand New World

639.109 --> 644.4490000000001
Order they're all pushing it that's kind

641.929 --> 646.939
of how you know it how you know they are

644.449 --> 650.149
the New World Order whatever they're

646.939 --> 653.149
going to say about it if they're against

650.149 --> 654.289
it if they are for it or if they say it

653.149 --> 657.169
isn't going to be there in the future

654.289 --> 661.66
doesn't really matter you know they are

657.169 --> 664.999
part of it by their actions

661.66 --> 669.679
you just have to differentiate their

664.999 --> 676.669
actions versus their narrative and weigh

669.679 --> 681.1089999999999
it off very carefully anyway so yeah

676.669 --> 682.97
that's just happening and it is of

681.109 --> 685.6990000000001
course alarming because every time

682.97 --> 688.9390000000001
something like this especially on such a

685.699 --> 691.8499999999999
large scale is done when big crisis acts

688.939 --> 693.98
happen there's oh you can almost

691.85 --> 697.879
immediately conclude that there is some

693.98 --> 701.779
kind of hefty plan on the way that needs

697.879 --> 704.029
shock momentum to to get through and to

701.779 --> 711.019
pass by the people while they are all

704.029 --> 716.05
stammering and distracted so what is so

711.019 --> 718.82
incredible so incredibly alarming

716.05 --> 723.31
for the general public that they would

718.82 --> 726.4100000000001
have to pull out this level of an act

723.31 --> 728.0899999999999
what is it what specifically is this

726.41 --> 730.37
thing and I'm not talking just about

728.09 --> 733.5500000000001
bills bills bills plans plans plans

730.37 --> 738.92
rescue plans blah whatever bailout know

733.55 --> 742.79
what is specifically the thing that

738.92 --> 752.65
requires so much crisis Act in order for

742.79 --> 757.0999999999999
them to to think it's worth it because

752.65 --> 760.76
would it just be like a huge annex camp

757.1 --> 764.27
just to disrupt society and kill off

760.76 --> 769.0
like old people that are being abandoned

764.27 --> 774.97
or is it just purely that is that really

769.0 --> 777.68
worth doing a crisis Act to this level

774.97 --> 779.78
being exposed to this level for

777.68 --> 781.9399999999999
something that is relatively overt and

779.78 --> 784.88
will be blatantly obvious afterward

781.94 --> 787.4300000000001
after it's all settled I don't think it

784.88 --> 793.33
doesn't make sense see it doesn't make

787.43 --> 797.54
sense it's it the weight doesn't match

793.33 --> 799.88
see there's something else there's

797.54 --> 803.3
something else that's lying in the

799.88 --> 806.99
weights ready to be quickly quickly

803.3 --> 809.27
quickly rammed through maybe they'll

806.99 --> 811.91
even bring out the special defence

809.27 --> 814.24
squads the moment when they do it

811.91 --> 817.28
because it would be that horrific I

814.24 --> 822.44
don't know man it could be I don't want

817.28 --> 827.6
to be a high P again it's just I have to

822.44 --> 829.5200000000001
read the signs and then yeah open my

827.6 --> 833.8100000000001
eyes a little bit wider and I hope I'm

829.52 --> 836.8299999999999
not gonna be the only one pretend emic

833.81 --> 836.8299999999999
that's right

838.43 --> 849.0899999999999
yeah yeah there's certainly a lot of

840.72 --> 853.4100000000001
memes right now but I don't wanna you

849.09 --> 859.0500000000001
know I see what I tried to do there it's

853.41 --> 861.3
like yeah this is going on and they're

859.05 --> 863.52
so stupid they're all the people believe

861.3 --> 869.79
it they're so stupid or the plan demmick

863.52 --> 876.27
and so dumb no I

869.79 --> 880.4399999999999
I think the overt Ness is like a first

876.27 --> 882.93
layer savonia trap it's there so all the

880.44 --> 885.3900000000001
spiral people that are hungry for more

882.93 --> 887.6999999999999
spiraling out of control will just take

885.39 --> 889.4399999999999
a little bite and then make a giant

887.7 --> 892.98
story and spend like another year on

889.44 --> 897.3000000000001
that nonsense that's kind of that I

892.98 --> 901.5
think because there is just no logical

897.3 --> 906.06
reason to do all this if there wasn't

901.5 --> 908.01
something extremely dire somewhere that

906.06 --> 909.54
they want to sneak through like that and

908.01 --> 911.88
I'm not just talking about like

909.54 --> 913.65
installing 5g towers you know because

911.88 --> 916.92
those are the relatively individual

913.65 --> 919.86
problems yes it's a good timing for them

916.92 --> 926.2099999999999
to do it to kind of sneak it through but

919.86 --> 930.48
that's not shock value worthy enough I

926.21 --> 933.36
think something else it's it's some kind

930.48 --> 936.87
of bill or some kind of massive massive

933.36 --> 938.82
power shift I don't know maybe they're

936.87 --> 941.25
just gonna freakin say sorry the

938.82 --> 946.95
pandemic it's too bad and every

941.25 --> 949.71
politicians gonna be like yeah sorry we

946.95 --> 951.99
are now officially declaring world

949.71 --> 954.27
governments like no we're just gonna

951.99 --> 955.98
declare it like that it's like yeah all

954.27 --> 958.5
the world leaders they have signed this

955.98 --> 961.98
contract it's like the new and arctic

958.5 --> 962.19
treaty it they're just gonna do it like

961.98 --> 964.1700000000001
that

962.19 --> 967.2
and it's like yeah it's not we'd work

964.17 --> 970.24
like this now no more talk of treason

967.2 --> 972.4590000000001
because you talk to some else in sick

970.24 --> 974.74
no it's like no the world leaders are

972.459 --> 977.29
now from now I'm pretty much gonna do

974.74 --> 979.809
the same thing but they no longer have

977.29 --> 981.49
an obligation to tell anyone what

979.809 --> 986.05
they're actually planning in secret

981.49 --> 990.999
something like that that may suddenly

986.05 --> 994.929
suddenly just like that happen I don't

990.999 --> 999.6
know it would be extreme enough in my

994.929 --> 1004.379
view in order for to justify such I

999.6 --> 1006.809
white eye level how wide crisis Act

1004.379 --> 1010.86
situation like that it's just the only

1006.809 --> 1015.139
thing I can imagine for that but who

1010.86 --> 1017.85
knows what else you know already

1015.139 --> 1019.889
brought forth here and there the idea of

1017.85 --> 1023.6990000000001
the electric ether that there that they

1019.889 --> 1026.549
might introduce the actual 5g technology

1023.699 --> 1030.779
or rather the 6g that's still in the

1026.549 --> 1032.279
weight to just bring universal internet

1030.779 --> 1035.01
everywhere at all time with no

1032.279 --> 1040.14
connection something like that and that

1035.01 --> 1043.559
that would cause massive deaths and they

1040.14 --> 1045.659
have to maneuver everybody in the right

1043.559 --> 1048.6589999999999
position in order to take the fall for

1045.659 --> 1050.64
the backlash so they're like it's like a

1048.659 --> 1053.0100000000002
timing thing they're all trying to push

1050.64 --> 1055.409
one another eyes like no no it's like

1053.01 --> 1057.6
yeah I'm gonna rule no wait but I'm

1055.409 --> 1061.0490000000002
gonna try to maneuver it so that you

1057.6 --> 1062.9699999999998
might just exactly at that moment be in

1061.049 --> 1065.7
control and you take the fall and

1062.97 --> 1067.98
everybody's gonna be hungry for blood

1065.7 --> 1074.039
because like everybody's lost people all

1067.98 --> 1077.549
of a sudden just like that maybe it is

1074.039 --> 1082.77
you know all these weird possibility

1077.549 --> 1085.77
strings they're all they're doing their

1082.77 --> 1090.4089999999999
own things so somewhat interconnected

1085.77 --> 1090.4089999999999
and maybe not

1091.5 --> 1102.43
anyway that's my long-term insight on

1098.41 --> 1107.44
that we with much more guys but you know

1102.43 --> 1111.1200000000001
because I'll get to it when I'll get to

1107.44 --> 1111.1200000000001
it let's see what's happening in chat

1132.95 --> 1136.039
[Music]

1140.69 --> 1143.809
[Music]

1161.24 --> 1165.75
yeah

1162.56 --> 1165.75
[Music]

1187.929 --> 1192.96
hmm okay Mindwarp yeah

1193.86 --> 1201.6689999999999
yeah that is odd just goes to say that

1198.539 --> 1208.869
Australia apparently has a policy of

1201.669 --> 1210.8500000000001
panic towards the people to be fair like

1208.869 --> 1214.509
with the Netherland so far it's been

1210.85 --> 1217.059
kind of neutral they haven't continued

1214.509 --> 1221.769
pushing it too far so far that may

1217.059 --> 1223.4189999999999
change though you know but among many

1221.769 --> 1225.519
countries I think the Netherlands is

1223.419 --> 1226.3890000000001
probably one of the more reasonable

1225.519 --> 1230.71
responses

1226.389 --> 1234.789
although yeah that's like reasonable

1230.71 --> 1239.289
yeah from from a neutral perspective I

1234.789 --> 1242.46
guess but with other countries is

1239.289 --> 1242.46
getting pretty crazy sometimes

1254.99 --> 1264.28
local phone towers and looking for

1257.24 --> 1264.28
differences like fine who you really mmm

1265.66 --> 1276.17
quarantine is more dangerous than the

1267.89 --> 1278.51
flu well it depends you know if you

1276.17 --> 1281.0800000000002
completely quarantine yes that is

1278.51 --> 1284.6
dangerous it's gonna disrupt the economy

1281.08 --> 1287.1399999999999
badly it's gonna destroy jobs sends

1284.6 --> 1289.6699999999998
economics out of whack with people

1287.14 --> 1291.2900000000002
people that keep things going they're

1289.67 --> 1295.0700000000002
gonna go out of whack financially and

1291.29 --> 1298.04
all that yeah it's big trouble so an

1295.07 --> 1301.7
absolute quarantine is is problematic

1298.04 --> 1303.68
it's ridiculous it this flu with the

1301.7 --> 1312.92
data that's come out does not justify

1303.68 --> 1318.7
this at all and I I don't understand

1312.92 --> 1324.5900000000001
really how so many governments are like

1318.7 --> 1326.39
allowed to to respond like that why

1324.59 --> 1329.09
there aren't basically people on the

1326.39 --> 1331.8500000000001
sidelines set looking very carefully and

1329.09 --> 1333.3799999999999
just saying no this is criminal what

1331.85 --> 1338.6599999999999
you're doing here is criminal you're

1333.38 --> 1340.91
trying to portray a a well so far pretty

1338.66 --> 1342.8300000000002
harmless virus that's being extremely

1340.91 --> 1345.8600000000001
hyped up and there's already proof of

1342.83 --> 1349.25
this that there's being falsified with

1345.86 --> 1354.4099999999999
numbers with stats and with big footage

1349.25 --> 1356.93
yeah and I think that yeah I don't

1354.41 --> 1358.7
understand why those people here look

1356.93 --> 1360.91
who's talking I should probably be doing

1358.7 --> 1362.9
that as well but yeah I'm kind of like

1360.91 --> 1367.8200000000002
I'm just an Arlen

1362.9 --> 1369.5900000000001
you know I barely know I know more about

1367.82 --> 1371.78
other countries than I do about my own

1369.59 --> 1376.1
which is kind of stupid really it's not

1371.78 --> 1379.45
very nationalistic but it's just that's

1376.1 --> 1379.4499999999998
just how it came to be

1379.95 --> 1385.3300000000002
but yeah why aren't they just telling

1383.59 --> 1389.8799999999999
these politicians now look if you're

1385.33 --> 1392.8
gonna go heavy quarantine like

1389.88 --> 1395.6100000000001
situations over a virus that is very

1392.8 --> 1399.1
blatantly not very deadly

1395.61 --> 1403.1799999999998
then we're gonna hold you criminally

1399.1 --> 1405.6999999999998
accountable I don't like what law

1403.18 --> 1410.3200000000002
protection because you're opposed in no

1405.7 --> 1413.2
no no no we're gonna hold your

1410.32 --> 1415.9299999999998
criminally accountable one way or the

1413.2 --> 1418.42
other if you're just gonna literally

1415.93 --> 1421.75
wreck economies and get people killed

1418.42 --> 1424.03
literally killed because of extreme

1421.75 --> 1429.46
quarantine measures for something that

1424.03 --> 1432.3
does not justify that at all but I don't

1429.46 --> 1432.3
really see it happening

1437.749 --> 1445.679
sometimes I wonder even if if even the

1442.919 --> 1448.7990000000002
some people in government themselves are

1445.679 --> 1450.539
just bluffing that it's like oh the

1448.799 --> 1453.539
situation extreme we're gonna give

1450.539 --> 1456.719
extreme measures everybody do this and

1453.539 --> 1459.6589999999999
that but then they don't really follow

1456.719 --> 1464.759
through on it they just send people into

1459.659 --> 1468.269
the do as I say games I don't know I

1464.759 --> 1470.039
don't know for sure I don't check I

1468.269 --> 1472.109
don't have a drone with a camera

1470.039 --> 1476.459
following all these politicians to see

1472.109 --> 1479.4289999999999
what they actually do I wouldn't even

1476.459 --> 1481.799
want to just follow them normally on

1479.429 --> 1485.8200000000002
camera most politicians are just

1481.799 --> 1489.139
absolutely unbearable especially then

1485.82 --> 1493.039
they are unbearable you think like

1489.139 --> 1498.57
Democrat politicians in the US are bad

1493.039 --> 1501.359
well they're oh like that here in a way

1498.57 --> 1505.259
just slightly different they are all

1501.359 --> 1506.999
more neutral bland weird European alike

1505.259 --> 1509.849
but it's all like that they're all

1506.999 --> 1516.659
delusional all of them all the

1509.849 --> 1518.6899999999998
politicians if they're I don't know but

1516.659 --> 1521.3990000000001
I've had that sensation for a long time

1518.69 --> 1524.039
you know if it wouldn't have been like

1521.399 --> 1527.099
that I probably have gone into politics

1524.039 --> 1529.679
it's just that I find them so unbearable

1527.099 --> 1533.249
I can't sit there I wouldn't be able to

1529.679 --> 1537.1190000000001
sit there just go through all the stupid

1533.249 --> 1539.599
games in the tote did the toe tagging

1537.119 --> 1543.359
hit the toe tag the rope pulling

1539.599 --> 1545.6689999999999
nonsense non-stop day in day out every

1543.359 --> 1548.759
day the freaking political nonsense

1545.669 --> 1551.5990000000002
every day it's it's unbelievable in

1548.759 --> 1558.809
Netherlands unbelievable it's

1551.599 --> 1561.089
embarrassing really bad although to be

1558.809 --> 1563.879
fair I haven't really checked out too

1561.089 --> 1567.899
much in the reason

1563.879 --> 1570.4189999999999
months it's just that every time I do

1567.899 --> 1572.129
tune in again to watch something

1570.419 --> 1576.6290000000001
concerning the Netherlands I just go

1572.129 --> 1578.279
like oh I don't have to be nitpicky

1576.629 --> 1580.9789999999998
about such stupid things why they have

1578.279 --> 1591.749
to be so far Jo sickly uh it just

1580.979 --> 1594.509
creatures they all creeped me out yeah I

1591.749 --> 1598.1390000000001
as a politician I'd probably be way too

1594.509 --> 1602.219
aggressive getting sick I'd be like okay

1598.139 --> 1604.4989999999998
I'd be pretty much like I'm gonna be

1602.219 --> 1606.989
like okay let's get real here if you

1604.499 --> 1609.239
people are gonna allow yourself to get

1606.989 --> 1614.039
up in these stupid politicized game

1609.239 --> 1616.589
because of some nickels I'm gonna hold

1614.039 --> 1619.079
you criminally accountable I'm gonna

1616.589 --> 1620.549
show a share that message like with the

1619.079 --> 1624.779
people and their political party

1620.549 --> 1627.299
non-stop it's like no you're gonna drop

1624.779 --> 1630.059
the stupid freakin games and we're gonna

1627.299 --> 1635.399
get real we're gonna [ __ ] freak fix

1630.059 --> 1638.549
the country solve the nonsense get the

1635.399 --> 1640.319
globalists off our ass and people that

1638.549 --> 1643.049
are gonna work against it we're gonna

1640.319 --> 1647.4289999999999
investigate you if you got some like

1643.049 --> 1650.539
pedo connection [ __ ] going on yeah and

1647.429 --> 1650.539
then it'd probably be shot

1655.05 --> 1662.79
so yeah that's why I considered going

1660.0 --> 1667.43
into politics and then the careful

1662.79 --> 1670.83
consideration thought now decline maybe

1667.43 --> 1675.39
maybe when I get more gray hair so maybe

1670.83 --> 1678.6899999999998
when I cool the freak down and I can

1675.39 --> 1684.8400000000001
just accept that politics is fubar and

1678.69 --> 1687.8700000000001
just maybe then but yeah well what good

1684.84 --> 1690.2099999999998
would it do by that anyway you know is

1687.87 --> 1693.03
there even gonna be any Dutch politics

1690.21 --> 1706.29
by then or is it just gonna be the world

1693.03 --> 1711.45
government yes Robin Stanley yeah I

1706.29 --> 1714.4099999999999
enjoy a lot of the spirit of the of the

1711.45 --> 1717.8700000000001
founding fathers as their generalized

1714.41 --> 1722.3100000000002
like those people of that age that had

1717.87 --> 1726.3
these visions that had these plans they

1722.31 --> 1730.11
in a way they casted a spell but yeah a

1726.3 --> 1735.45
spell that is that is still good-natured

1730.11 --> 1738.1499999999999
it is still is a good spell I guess but

1735.45 --> 1741.3
it has dangerous downsides when it's

1738.15 --> 1745.88
overblown but yeah they had they had

1741.3 --> 1748.95
right ideas they were very sharp and

1745.88 --> 1751.71
they were like sharp and unrelenting

1748.95 --> 1753.69
headed and that is something that I

1751.71 --> 1757.53
really appreciate and it's like a lost

1753.69 --> 1760.77
art the world's become so nitpicky so

1757.53 --> 1763.56
pushy so invasive that it's almost

1760.77 --> 1766.8899999999999
impossible to even maintain your spirit

1763.56 --> 1769.44
like that and survive your minds just

1766.89 --> 1772.41
gonna break in this will with that

1769.44 --> 1774.42
mindset gonna break very quickly you

1772.41 --> 1776.16
know just think about it think about the

1774.42 --> 1779.75
freakin founding fathers just the

1776.16 --> 1783.66
science fiction set up it's like okay

1779.75 --> 1785.64
Alex Jones finds a time machine says

1783.66 --> 1787.6200000000001
damn this

1785.64 --> 1789.96
as the freaky Kabbalists we need two

1787.62 --> 1791.6399999999999
founding fathers right now and he's

1789.96 --> 1795.44
gonna go with this time machine back to

1791.64 --> 1798.72
70 70 I don't know eight years something

1795.44 --> 1801.8700000000001
after the it has been found is like a

1798.72 --> 1804.75
founding fathers we need you come with

1801.87 --> 1806.6999999999998
us they're like okay future of America

1804.75 --> 1808.65
is in great peril we saw this coming

1806.7 --> 1812.25
even the Bible spoke about it so they'd

1808.65 --> 1813.69
be like okay let's go and the founding

1812.25 --> 1816.29
father suddenly through a time machine

1813.69 --> 1818.8200000000002
with Alex Jones come to this age and

1816.29 --> 1823.23
like okay so what seems to be the

1818.82 --> 1826.08
problem like are they trying to take the

1823.23 --> 1828.45
guns and you know they're gonna approach

1826.08 --> 1830.4289999999999
it strategically from their mindset from

1828.45 --> 1832.5
back then what the issues were back then

1830.429 --> 1834.69
and then they're gonna be revealed like

1832.5 --> 1838.38
everything that's happened and they're

1834.69 --> 1840.3600000000001
gonna be like screw you guys this is

1838.38 --> 1840.99
like ten times worse than the king of

1840.36 --> 1845.4289999999999
England

1840.99 --> 1850.86
Yuuka people are insane this is not

1845.429 --> 1855.6000000000001
America this is just a hollowed-out peak

1850.86 --> 1857.9399999999998
skin with America written on it and and

1855.6 --> 1859.62
and and you're gonna think that that is

1857.94 --> 1861.8400000000001
like what the Founding what we were all

1859.62 --> 1865.26
about what our country know that that

1861.84 --> 1868.4399999999998
apparently was lost in in in nineteen

1865.26 --> 1872.0
seventy yeah that's when you lost it

1868.44 --> 1877.02
nobody stopped it everybody cheered it

1872.0 --> 1882.75
in a way and yeah good luck with that

1877.02 --> 1885.54
we're gonna go back to 70 70 78 or 70 70

1882.75 --> 1888.87
yeah we're gonna go back to 70 78 now

1885.54 --> 1890.78
and we're just gonna live in the America

1888.87 --> 1894.51
that we're gonna make with our

1890.78 --> 1897.299
sacrifices and yeah I guess the future

1894.51 --> 1899.82
wasn't as nice as we hoped it was gonna

1897.299 --> 1903.75
be but we're still gonna make America

1899.82 --> 1907.4399999999998
crush in our age and yeah whatever you

1903.75 --> 1909.78
do good luck with that yeah that's what

1907.44 --> 1912.23
do we happen you know this is true you

1909.78 --> 1912.23
know it

1916.12 --> 1921.9499999999998
yeah I was just improvising there with

1918.92 --> 1925.8500000000001
the pigskin I'm just they're gonna say

1921.95 --> 1928.46
something derogatory about the

1925.85 --> 1930.56
modern-day ideas of America that go

1928.46 --> 1934.0900000000001
about in the public they're going to say

1930.56 --> 1934.09
absolutely something derogatory

1940.27 --> 1943.5
[Music]

1950.1 --> 1954.809
pad your knob though no actually

1952.41 --> 1956.88
politicians of the 18th century would

1954.809 --> 1959.9289999999999
absolutely dominate if they got the

1956.88 --> 1963.99
chance you know why they would simply

1959.929 --> 1967.6200000000001
shoot their opponent if they were lying

1963.99 --> 1972.15
to demonically or if they caught them in

1967.62 --> 1974.9899999999998
some in some serious criminal financial

1972.15 --> 1976.3200000000002
scheme they were just freaking shootin

1974.99 --> 1981.66
yeah

1976.32 --> 1987.02
and it's like yeah for because yeah

1981.66 --> 1989.97
because of Honor because of God yeah

1987.02 --> 1992.97
that can help now you know that's not

1989.97 --> 1995.34
gonna work but that's back then if

1992.97 --> 1998.1000000000001
people if the politicians like they were

1995.34 --> 2000.73
in a room and if somebody insulted

1998.1 --> 2004.52
somebody else really badly

2000.73 --> 2008.6
dishonorably or slander them in a in a

2004.52 --> 2011.929
very bad way they would say step outside

2008.6 --> 2015.26
sir and pick your arm pick your arms

2011.929 --> 2018.47
because we're going to duel now and if

2015.26 --> 2022.37
you don't you will be shamed everywhere

2018.47 --> 2023.929
and yeah you will not be allowed in the

2022.37 --> 2026.4189999999999
profession anymore like that it's

2023.929 --> 2029.27
something like that I'm going I might

2026.419 --> 2030.8300000000002
not get the actual structural details

2029.27 --> 2036.08
correct here but it would be much more

2030.83 --> 2037.6999999999998
like that because yeah it was more an

2036.08 --> 2040.9089999999999
honor based system

2037.7 --> 2043.429
everybody had more honor nobody was

2040.909 --> 2046.22
being forced to strip their honor just

2043.429 --> 2049.4900000000002
to get by nobody they didn't even do it

2046.22 --> 2053.54
with their own slaves people they did

2049.49 --> 2057.08
not take that much dignity of their

2053.54 --> 2059.379
slaves and I'm talking about like

2057.08 --> 2062.21
plantation slaves and it could be

2059.379 --> 2065.27
Africans it could be Irish indentured

2062.21 --> 2069.71
servants they did not take that much

2065.27 --> 2073.149
dignity from their slaves as what has

2069.71 --> 2073.149
kind of been normalized right now

2092.84 --> 2099.28
no Journal de I'm absolutely not talking

2095.45 --> 2099.2799999999997
out of my ass I am NOT

2106.59 --> 2113.01
no they did give their slaves more

2110.55 --> 2115.8
dignity look I don't know

2113.01 --> 2118.23
I think you've watched too many

2115.8 --> 2121.29
Hollywood movies you know because of

2118.23 --> 2123.96
course every individual with power out

2121.29 --> 2126.24
there in the world there's this average

2123.96 --> 2129.63
thing if there's power there is gonna be

2126.24 --> 2132.0299999999997
some power abuse right so of course

2129.63 --> 2134.37
there were slave owners that would

2132.03 --> 2136.23
basically treat their slaves brutally

2134.37 --> 2140.04
but they probably treat their own

2136.23 --> 2142.17
freakin family brutally maybe maybe they

2140.04 --> 2144.69
were just maniacs that happened to be

2142.17 --> 2147.36
slave of slave owners but to then say

2144.69 --> 2153.7200000000003
that that was normal absolute [ __ ]

2147.36 --> 2156.84
no no absolutely not and a lot of slaves

2153.72 --> 2159.24
were also basically after working a

2156.84 --> 2162.57
period after they've attained skills

2159.24 --> 2165.54
they were freed and then they would get

2162.57 --> 2172.7400000000002
a paid job instead and some slaves

2165.54 --> 2175.38
didn't want that so it's it's slavery in

2172.74 --> 2180.29
the past it's just not what you think

2175.38 --> 2180.29
it's not like the slavery that goes on

2180.86 --> 2186.03
in like north and northeast Africa and

2184.71 --> 2189.27
all that you know there's nothing like

2186.03 --> 2191.3100000000004
that that's not the slavery that

2189.27 --> 2198.15
happened in the US I'm pretty confident

2191.31 --> 2200.5499999999997
about it I think that the u.s. just used

2198.15 --> 2203.37
the slaves just as workers they just

2200.55 --> 2207.36
wanted workers and the system kind of

2203.37 --> 2211.08
worked that was that it they weren't

2207.36 --> 2214.7400000000002
like we got some people to abuse or

2211.08 --> 2219.62
something no that's that I don't think

2214.74 --> 2222.12
that was of the mindset at all back then

2219.62 --> 2224.93
don't think they were uh preoccupied

2222.12 --> 2224.93
with that kind of nonsense

2232.22 --> 2238.7099999999996
but again there's there probably would

2236.1 --> 2242.1
have been exceptions to it there

2238.71 --> 2244.35
you know psychopaths in between kind of

2242.1 --> 2247.83
abusing the situation to just create

2244.35 --> 2252.15
Horrors so yeah those would have been

2247.83 --> 2255.06
there too you know unfortunately but it

2252.15 --> 2257.13
was not the general situation I refused

2255.06 --> 2266.52
to believe that that doesn't make any

2257.13 --> 2269.6400000000003
logical sense you know like even if that

2266.52 --> 2272.69
were the case then there would be much

2269.64 --> 2275.52
more real historical evidence of like

2272.69 --> 2276.62
brutal slave pits and that kind of thing

2275.52 --> 2279.12
okay

2276.62 --> 2282.8399999999997
now you never gonna have slave pets

2279.12 --> 2287.33
right right they didn't do that in the

2282.84 --> 2287.33
United States not not at all

2297.069 --> 2303.969
well I do have an opinion based on the

2299.999 --> 2306.279
truth of slavery because I just want to

2303.969 --> 2309.039
get things real and slavery is like a

2306.279 --> 2312.309
technical issue but to then blow it out

2309.039 --> 2314.7690000000002
of proportion that in the past slavery

2312.309 --> 2316.6600000000003
was just like oh yeah these are the

2314.769 --> 2318.519
people that we were allowed to torture

2316.66 --> 2321.0989999999997
you know that's almost like it's being

2318.519 --> 2325.779
forwarded right now it's nonsense it's

2321.099 --> 2332.9790000000003
absolute [ __ ] it just is it's not

2325.779 --> 2336.64
that you know and I just want to be real

2332.979 --> 2339.509
about it also to compare it to where are

2336.64 --> 2344.459
we now what is our slavery

2339.509 --> 2349.529
what if B when what if we all been

2344.459 --> 2349.529
gradually subdued into becoming part of

2351.119 --> 2357.119
which in a way is also a form of slavery

2354.16 --> 2357.1189999999997
but it's different

2365.71 --> 2370.73
Arobin Stanley yeah I'm gonna get I'm

2368.51 --> 2373.3900000000003
gonna ask for some feedback about what

2370.73 --> 2373.39
I've just said

2378.13 --> 2381.4300000000003
I don't know do you guys agree with what

2380.589 --> 2383.589
I just said

2381.43 --> 2389.91
or do you think that I'm being too

2383.589 --> 2389.91
apologetic about Americans in the past

2409.08 --> 2419.48
oh really turn up the why why I don't

2416.28 --> 2419.48
like that you're doing that

2438.02 --> 2443.95
yeah Omar colored so am i but that's

2440.93 --> 2447.77
also why specifically mentioned right

2443.95 --> 2452.0299999999997
concerning slavery in America African

2447.77 --> 2453.74
slaves and the Irish or rather the

2452.03 --> 2456.11
indentured servants like there were a

2453.74 --> 2459.56
lot of Irish and all kinds of European

2456.11 --> 2463.9900000000002
folk and they were slaves and you were

2459.56 --> 2467.6
white oh yeah white as a white merica B

2463.99 --> 2473.8399999999997
so yeah white slaves white skin colored

2467.6 --> 2477.5299999999997
slaves mm-hmm lots of them yeah it's not

2473.84 --> 2479.51
only black so I just want to get that

2477.53 --> 2485.119
straight I just want to get it straight

2479.51 --> 2489.46
it's not a black thing slavery is not a

2485.119 --> 2493.25
racist thing although a lot of racists

2489.46 --> 2495.29
might be inclined to think that slavery

2493.25 --> 2497.39
is kind of okay as long as it's the bad

2495.29 --> 2504.83
race or something you know but that's a

2497.39 --> 2506.8399999999997
mindset and I I don't think it was even

2504.83 --> 2511.52
like that back then I don't think that

2506.84 --> 2514.79
weird I guess ideological extremity

2511.52 --> 2516.74
based thinking even arrived back then I

2514.79 --> 2519.98
think that's something much more from

2516.74 --> 2522.7099999999996
the eighteen from the 19th century when

2519.98 --> 2526.01
that came around when the idea when

2522.71 --> 2530.45
communism really started to form in the

2526.01 --> 2532.73
form it did and and psychiatry and the

2530.45 --> 2534.6189999999997
yeah and the New World Order plan you

2532.73 --> 2537.29
know I think that is when that came into

2534.619 --> 2540.109
being I don't think people were like

2537.29 --> 2545.72
that in the 18th century in the 17th

2540.109 --> 2551.119
century at all they wouldn't be about

2545.72 --> 2554.359
race they would be about status and they

2551.119 --> 2557.33
would be about skills and I bet you that

2554.359 --> 2560.869
people like in 70 century absolutely

2557.33 --> 2564.0499999999997
would appreciate like an African man for

2560.869 --> 2567.98
their stamina and their strength and and

2564.05 --> 2570.29
all that while they yet but they

2567.98 --> 2571.52
wouldn't be like oh yeah that means the

2570.29 --> 2573.56
queen is like

2571.52 --> 2576.2
the king is gonna marry that because

2573.56 --> 2580.19
status you know doll that that's not

2576.2 --> 2582.71
about racism at all it would never be

2580.19 --> 2585.44
about that see it will be much more

2582.71 --> 2590.17
about your people taking care of your

2585.44 --> 2590.17
people your borders just basics

2597.83 --> 2602.08
oh good servant you're Italian I didn't

2599.81 --> 2602.08
know that

2606.07 --> 2611.5800000000004
you get a lot of grief for the Italian

2609.1 --> 2611.58
government

2644.85 --> 2650.0099999999998
yeah I don't know Tom Parker I wouldn't

2648.24 --> 2652.77
necessarily agree I don't think that

2650.01 --> 2656.8500000000004
people of west and east africa even

2652.77 --> 2659.49
agree on that it's just that i don't

2656.85 --> 2665.13
know racist kind of oversimplification I

2659.49 --> 2667.3199999999997
guess it's just that the entire emphasis

2665.13 --> 2676.53
on it as a social construct is such a

2667.32 --> 2680.2200000000003
waste of time really human race oh yeah

2676.53 --> 2683.4
but we're definitely different okay let

2680.22 --> 2687.6
me emphasize yeah one human race fine

2683.4 --> 2692.6
we're all very different yeah difference

2687.6 --> 2697.46
it's okay it's okay to be different yeah

2692.6 --> 2700.97
different skin color different feelings

2697.46 --> 2704.9700000000003
different background different instincts

2700.97 --> 2706.9199999999996
different it's okay they're different

2704.97 --> 2711.6899999999996
and that's okay

2706.92 --> 2714.03
see I don't have a problem with that but

2711.69 --> 2717.84
I'm not gonna say everybody is the same

2714.03 --> 2722.1600000000003
we're all human beings there is no race

2717.84 --> 2724.29
no I'm not gonna be that virtue secondly

2722.16 --> 2727.89
I'm just gonna say yeah we're all

2724.29 --> 2730.5299999999997
different and that's okay it's actually

2727.89 --> 2732.29
kind of good thank God we're not all the

2730.53 --> 2735.2900000000004
same

2732.29 --> 2735.29
literally

2737.06 --> 2740.389
[Music]

2741.559 --> 2752.3390000000004
we bred from aliens you should you

2747.509 --> 2755.059
deserve a timeout for that I'm probably

2752.339 --> 2760.549
not gonna do it

2755.059 --> 2760.549
there is no aliens yes Jones

2786.45 --> 2793.14
oh don't use God with three capital

2790.14 --> 2804.18
letters that's not good that's weird

2793.14 --> 2807.0789999999997
Mason stuff just the G you don't need

2804.18 --> 2807.0789999999997
any legal God

2810.63 --> 2813.7690000000002
[Music]

2816.89 --> 2822.779
culture and race yeah but I wasn't

2819.029 --> 2826.14
talking about culture Tom Parker culture

2822.779 --> 2831.15
is what comes socially on top is what

2826.14 --> 2833.67
boils up no I'm talking about just the

2831.15 --> 2837.4790000000003
entire fabric of your essence the spirit

2833.67 --> 2838.65
type that comes there the genetic traits

2837.479 --> 2840.479
the genetic response

2838.65 --> 2842.489
yes different it's different it's all

2840.479 --> 2848.089
different different different different

2842.489 --> 2853.89
different Oh like it I like different I

2848.089 --> 2857.42
don't like it too much you know but I I

2853.89 --> 2860.8799999999997
don't know but I an average I guess that

2857.42 --> 2864.509
people that are too much alike I don't

2860.88 --> 2866.489
really like them if they're two not

2864.509 --> 2868.259
alike I don't really like them either

2866.489 --> 2870.029
because there's just no connection so

2868.259 --> 2872.91
we're not on the same frequency but

2870.029 --> 2876.359
there's no way to communicate so I like

2872.91 --> 2879.5989999999997
somebody that is kind of similar but

2876.359 --> 2884.04
still very clearly different because

2879.599 --> 2887.19
then then there's something to share I

2884.04 --> 2887.19
[Music]

2887.869 --> 2891.6600000000003
am wrong on this one

2889.68 --> 2894.1499999999996
no I don't think so but that's that's

2891.66 --> 2900.18
all fine you know

2894.15 --> 2902.579
I look the race the race the race is a

2900.18 --> 2905.509
social construct and the way it's being

2902.579 --> 2907.9790000000003
utilized induced and propagandized is

2905.509 --> 2912.059
ridiculous that is absolute nonsense

2907.979 --> 2917.1189999999997
false that doesn't mean that there is

2912.059 --> 2922.44
nothing to the concept of races it I

2917.119 --> 2928.44
approach races more like a regional

2922.44 --> 2931.319
group so you could you could technically

2928.44 --> 2934.469
for example over generalize entirety of

2931.319 --> 2937.2
Africa as a race but it's blatantly

2934.469 --> 2939.44
wrong just very different but if you

2937.2 --> 2944.029
take like this region from this country

2939.44 --> 2946.68
there's going to be a specific type of

2944.029 --> 2949.509
traits that these people will have

2946.68 --> 2951.009
battled typically I go on

2949.509 --> 2955.749
that could be considered more like a

2951.009 --> 2957.639
race and they will have like spiritual

2955.749 --> 2960.0589999999997
adjournment with their people and all

2957.639 --> 2966.4590000000003
and this yeah

2960.059 --> 2971.199
racial magic but yeah I think it it's

2966.459 --> 2973.439
still a thing it's just not how they use

2971.199 --> 2973.439
it

2986.6 --> 2995.95
yeah mind-warped I know right so they're

2992.21 --> 3001.139
just ruining it that isn't that typical

2995.95 --> 3001.1389999999997
[Music]

3007.93 --> 3012.46
yeah and I'm not even just it's not just

3010.24 --> 3015.1499999999996
black and white you know these were just

3012.46 --> 3018.069
the examples yeah

3015.15 --> 3020.65
regions it's also kind of an

3018.069 --> 3025.39
overgeneralization just try to compare

3020.65 --> 3030.369
for example well the obvious people from

3025.39 --> 3034.6299999999997
India and people from Russia and people

3030.369 --> 3035.529
from Korea for example do they look

3034.63 --> 3042.089
anything alike

3035.529 --> 3046.869
no do they share some traits probably

3042.089 --> 3049.779
but overall yeah it's the regions are so

3046.869 --> 3056.1400000000003
far apart conditions are so different

3049.779 --> 3058.329
they're a different race pretty much but

3056.14 --> 3061.9
you could even consider that within

3058.329 --> 3064.21
those especially like in China like the

3061.9 --> 3066.339
North Chinese are very different from

3064.21 --> 3068.98
the South Chinese for example they look

3066.339 --> 3071.319
slightly different or a lot different

3068.98 --> 3079.559
different type of skin tones build all

3071.319 --> 3084.3089999999997
that so yeah you can't just point at a

3079.559 --> 3087.4
continent and then call it a race races

3084.309 --> 3090.0690000000004
are really more a regional thing it's

3087.4 --> 3092.079
like a racial spectrum you have like a

3090.069 --> 3094.359
color spectrum you have two colors but

3092.079 --> 3096.549
if the racial spectrum and it's like you

3094.359 --> 3098.5
have the country there and then it's

3096.549 --> 3100.96
like over here it's like this and then

3098.5 --> 3102.76
slightly it mixes up over there it

3100.96 --> 3105.73
becomes like that and then from there it

3102.76 --> 3111.5690000000004
mixes up to there that's more what it's

3105.73 --> 3111.569
like kind of it's just how people mix

3120.619 --> 3125.9100000000003
yeah well Joran up though in relation to

3123.54 --> 3129.18
talking about racism

3125.91 --> 3133.3399999999997
I am absolutely allowing people to call

3129.18 --> 3133.3399999999997
that lint arts because it is [ __ ]

3163.97 --> 3170.99
okay well go ahead and work on mine for

3168.339 --> 3171.5299999999997
mark dice I haven't heard from him in a

3170.99 --> 3176.1499999999996
while

3171.53 --> 3179.059
oh really

3176.15 --> 3186.4900000000002
you need it you're an opt-out do you

3179.059 --> 3190.0890000000004
know what because of racism you think so

3186.49 --> 3196.299
because I called somebody a lift heart

3190.089 --> 3196.299
because modern liberalism is [ __ ]

3197.319 --> 3200.319
okay

3204.6 --> 3209.489
[Music]

3230.26 --> 3236.2000000000003
yeah getting sick I bet you do I've

3233.859 --> 3243.4
always tried to stay away because I

3236.2 --> 3248.109
don't know it's just that I've seen

3243.4 --> 3250.869
certain type of no black people like

3248.109 --> 3254.3199999999997
when it was brought up they get so vile

3250.869 --> 3257.56
they get so hurt by it it's just you can

3254.32 --> 3259.75
you can't have it you can't even defend

3257.56 --> 3261.63
a point even if it is a reasonable point

3259.75 --> 3264.609
because they'll just go nuts

3261.63 --> 3270.369
so I've person-to-person always like

3264.609 --> 3272.74
stay away from it but I refuse to also

3270.369 --> 3278.6800000000003
censor myself when I'm not around them I

3272.74 --> 3282.2799999999997
will talk about it because I have to why

3278.68 --> 3285.97
because I need to understand it that's

3282.28 --> 3288.4
why I talk about things not to hurt

3285.97 --> 3292.4399999999996
people I talk about it to clear things

3288.4 --> 3292.44
up and to start understanding it better

3293.67 --> 3304.21
right a good server there's some really

3301.54 --> 3306.25
awesome black people out there yeah one

3304.21 --> 3308.579
of them I know is chocolate sayin it's

3306.25 --> 3308.579
just

3310.06 --> 3316.72
he radiates this chocolates anng almost

3313.93 --> 3319.56
like I say enough and it's just great

3316.72 --> 3319.56
having him around

3320.19 --> 3325.3
yeah there's more of these like the yeah

3324.46 --> 3327.58
they're awesome

3325.3 --> 3330.71
absolutely

3327.58 --> 3330.71
[Music]

3339.88 --> 3349.4500000000003
and was it one again what's his name

3344.19 --> 3351.069
Dave Murphy also awesome guy that are in

3349.45 --> 3351.759
have an oddball in and ways but he's

3351.069 --> 3354.66
awesome

3351.759 --> 3354.66
very strong

3372.56 --> 3378.92
right I know well my twerp look there's

3376.94 --> 3382.52
plenty of black people that I don't

3378.92 --> 3385.16
really like okay but the thing about it

3382.52 --> 3390.08
is I don't obsess over that nonsense I

3385.16 --> 3392.81
don't get in their way I just like just

3390.08 --> 3395.36
you just do whatever man I'm gonna do

3392.81 --> 3398.0499999999997
what I want to do that's my attitude oh

3395.36 --> 3401.81
yeah Amanda Young is also black right

3398.05 --> 3404.0800000000004
yeah she's also I she's eight she's the

3401.81 --> 3404.08
best

3413.03 --> 3418.19
okay mind-warped I don't see the

3415.53 --> 3418.19
correlation

3442.15 --> 3449.4700000000003
now that's not the point I said Tom

3444.009 --> 3451.299
Parker it's just if there's people that

3449.47 --> 3454.48
I kind of don't like the way they think

3451.299 --> 3458.499
and talk that can be any type of people

3454.48 --> 3462.339
you know not saying that yeah whatever

3458.499 --> 3466.029
man I dislike most people okay it

3462.339 --> 3469.119
doesn't make me an [ __ ] though I just

3466.029 --> 3470.499
can't stand can't stand most people it

3469.119 --> 3479.9500000000003
just feels like a waste of my time

3470.499 --> 3482.68
that's all you know but hey I do my I do

3479.95 --> 3483.1299999999997
extremely my best to be nice you know I

3482.68 --> 3485.529
don't

3483.13 --> 3487.9
overkill do it I used to overkill do it

3485.529 --> 3489.67
like really be a slave to everyone

3487.9 --> 3493.4100000000003
that's stupid

3489.67 --> 3497.9500000000003
it was a complete waste of energy stupid

3493.41 --> 3502.0589999999997
but I tried to be very nice in a durable

3497.95 --> 3505.5589999999997
way to everyone even if that I think

3502.059 --> 3508.599
they're [ __ ] or misguided in a way

3505.559 --> 3512.2200000000003
but I'm not gonna help them get even

3508.599 --> 3512.2200000000003
more misguided if you know what I mean

3521.45 --> 3524.41
okay

3528.34 --> 3533.9500000000003
that's a very cynical thing to say jor

3531.04 --> 3536.05
an op though patriots and tyrants and

3533.95 --> 3539.47
then calling it manure you're saying

3536.05 --> 3542.52
that Patriots are manure that's not a

3539.47 --> 3542.52
very nice thing to say

3558.119 --> 3562.079
why did you turn them out

3568.94 --> 3573.4900000000002
I know Jeffrey Bell it's just that

3578.46 --> 3588.349
it could have also just called it

3580.56 --> 3591.27
fertilizer you know that never mind

3588.349 --> 3594.17
yeah but mine work I don't really see

3591.27 --> 3594.17
why you tighten them out

3616.22 --> 3622.18
oh okay that that's fine if that's okay

3620.42 --> 3625.25
[Music]

3622.18 --> 3628.22
then I usually only reserve the timeouts

3625.25 --> 3632.569
for people when they yeah get blatantly

3628.22 --> 3635.06
7a or something or if they're trolls so

3632.569 --> 3639.23
I didn't really see I know Jordan is

3635.06 --> 3642.8289999999997
being a bit annoying I guess little he's

3639.23 --> 3645.55
being very European or something I don't

3642.829 --> 3648.38
know what's that's called being liberal

3645.55 --> 3649.46
but yeah to time him out for that seems

3648.38 --> 3657.28
a bit excessive

3649.46 --> 3657.28
I is black now I wear black

3666.01 --> 3674.98
okay mine for okay that's fine yeah

3672.19 --> 3678.67
let's not let's not get into find Jorn

3674.98 --> 3680.56
