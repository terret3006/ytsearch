although i'm doing good at this moment

78.0 --> 84.84
financially for the time being

81.04 --> 87.68
ah so yeah the weather

84.84 --> 89.92
sheesh talk about unpredictable

87.68 --> 91.68
like literally half an hour ago this was

89.92 --> 95.28
a clear sky

91.68 --> 95.92
like almost entirely and yeah there was

95.28 --> 98.56
a wind

95.92 --> 100.32000000000001
a lot of way a lot of it but there was a

98.56 --> 101.92
lot of sun as well but it's just all

100.32 --> 104.96
gone away

101.92 --> 108.96000000000001
like in in 30 minutes it's just

104.96 --> 112.079
well those clouds are going pretty fast

108.96 --> 114.72
and if you can see the motion

112.079 --> 115.119
trying to hold the camera still i think

114.72 --> 116.479
you

115.119 --> 119.119
yeah you could probably see that blue

116.479 --> 121.6
spot to the left going away

119.119 --> 125.28
see i'm not moving my arm so yeah the

121.6 --> 125.28
wind's going pretty fast up there and

126.079 --> 131.599
yeah i thought it was gonna be a nice

128.959 --> 135.44
sunny day damn it

131.599 --> 139.04
oh maybe later it'll be a little better

135.44 --> 142.64
no rain so far although yesterday sheesh

139.04 --> 145.599
yesterday lots and lots of rain

142.64 --> 147.76
it was terrible i actually skipped my

145.599 --> 151.51999999999998
newspaper around because of it

147.76 --> 151.51999999999998
and it felt pretty weird because

151.599 --> 154.879
kind of when i said like yeah i'm

153.12 --> 158.48000000000002
definitely not gonna do it that's

154.879 --> 160.39999999999998
when for i don't know like five or six

158.48 --> 161.28
hours suddenly it cleared up and became

160.4 --> 164.08
a win still

161.28 --> 166.16
like as to push me like nah nah i'm

164.08 --> 168.48000000000002
gonna make you feel guilty

166.16 --> 169.76
or win for not doing it so and then when

168.48 --> 172.64
you do it

169.76 --> 173.51899999999998
rain right back over you it really felt

172.64 --> 175.67999999999998
like that

173.519 --> 176.56
was weird i had a very weird night

175.68 --> 180.08
yesterday

176.56 --> 182.84
very strange i was seduced from all

180.08 --> 184.15900000000002
sides all of a sudden because of that

182.84 --> 189.12
[ __ ]

184.159 --> 189.12
cabbage on monday some cabbage

190.959 --> 193.36
all right

194.4 --> 200.239
anyway let's see who is in chat so far

197.92 --> 201.11999999999998
good servant was first high even before

200.239 --> 202.64000000000001
two

201.12 --> 205.76
because i started up a little early

202.64 --> 209.35999999999999
today compensation from the for the last

205.76 --> 214.39999999999998
few times obermoco is there too

209.36 --> 218.239
tom parker guns of nephron rmp

214.4 --> 218.239
yeah good to see you all so far

218.319 --> 224.39999999999998
don't forget to share it guys sharing is

221.28 --> 226.48
more important than ever

224.4 --> 227.76000000000002
nathan also says it on this show

226.48 --> 229.67999999999998
regularly

227.76 --> 232.79899999999998
and it's true you really need to share

229.68 --> 232.799
it these days because

233.12 --> 236.31900000000002
yeah if you just think so yeah you know

235.92 --> 238.48
me

236.319 --> 240.159
you've seen me you think there's

238.48 --> 242.39999999999998
somebody out there ready

240.159 --> 245.599
for my level they have like if you're a

242.4 --> 248.0
complete out of nowhere newbie

245.599 --> 249.11999999999998
to flat earth and everything then just

248.0 --> 251.76
bumping into arwen

249.12 --> 254.0
is gonna be very weird it's gonna be

251.76 --> 258.079
very weird to you because i'm like

254.0 --> 261.68
very far off the normal like

258.079 --> 262.8
i don't hang around with my mind in the

261.68 --> 264.72
old

262.8 --> 266.96000000000004
in the old paradigms and all that too

264.72 --> 268.0
much i address them and i put them into

266.96 --> 270.0
context but i don't

268.0 --> 271.919
hang around in them and i just draw in

270.0 --> 275.68
completely

271.919 --> 277.919
on the edge new conceptions and things

275.68 --> 278.72
and reflections upon what's happening

277.919 --> 281.68
out there

278.72 --> 282.0
out of nowhere seemingly so newcomers

281.68 --> 284.0
yeah

282.0 --> 285.68
they're going to be a bit weirded out by

284.0 --> 288.8
me usually

285.68 --> 291.28000000000003
but if they're already

288.8 --> 292.24
on their journey like trying to figure

291.28 --> 294.32
things out

292.24 --> 296.8
and they already figured out a couple of

294.32 --> 299.36
things then they might stand a chance

296.8 --> 302.40000000000003
they might actually be

299.36 --> 305.36
gripped by what i do

302.4 --> 306.63899999999995
and yeah their curiosity will make them

305.36 --> 309.52000000000004
hang around at least

306.639 --> 310.40000000000003
and be because you might need to get

309.52 --> 313.919
some

310.4 --> 315.19899999999996
yeah it takes some time to get used to

313.919 --> 319.52
me

315.199 --> 322.84000000000003
and my brazenness in how i do things

319.52 --> 325.84
i'm very unapologetic about how i do

322.84 --> 325.84
things

327.36 --> 332.56
right so so it's very important to share

331.44 --> 335.039
it

332.56 --> 336.24
in on platforms that you deem fit that's

335.039 --> 338.08
why i say that not just

336.24 --> 340.639
any platform platforms that you didn't

338.08 --> 343.19899999999996
fit now it doesn't i don't think it has

340.639 --> 346.72
a lot of use

343.199 --> 348.96000000000004
like spamming the link in like

346.72 --> 350.639
platforms where they talk about corona

348.96 --> 354.08
and [ __ ] only

350.639 --> 357.68
you know or anti-factors you know

354.08 --> 359.68
maybe you could try it but people

357.68 --> 361.44
are then in generally gonna have just

359.68 --> 365.44
more troll

361.44 --> 367.84
response like ugh it's just spamming

365.44 --> 369.52
conspiracy nonsense so yeah it's

367.84 --> 373.11999999999995
important that

369.52 --> 376.31899999999996
the platform has to be fit for our win

373.12 --> 377.039
for people to be on the on a good enough

376.319 --> 380.56
frequency

377.039 --> 383.44
to tap in so yeah

380.56 --> 386.8
share it on any platform you didn't fit

383.44 --> 386.8
hey neil cosentino

392.84 --> 395.84
agm

397.919 --> 402.479
hey julio pevan good to see you

402.49 --> 405.569
[Music]

405.919 --> 410.15999999999997
all right

408.17 --> 412.639
[Music]

410.16 --> 414.0
man i was all stuttery yesterday by the

412.639 --> 416.0
way i didn't think that

414.0 --> 418.479
my show yesterday was all that good you

416.0 --> 421.84
know it doesn't mean that my thoughts

418.479 --> 422.24
are stupid i was just stumbling a lot my

421.84 --> 425.28
tongue

422.24 --> 427.36
and it was like more

425.28 --> 429.599
tapped out for some reason i don't know

427.36 --> 429.599
why

431.68 --> 437.84000000000003
maybe it was in the air maybe it was

433.52 --> 437.84
because of the impending storm coming

438.96 --> 443.919
flusters me a little but yeah today i

442.4 --> 446.4
feel a little bit better at least

443.919 --> 446.4
i think

447.68 --> 453.44
and i did make notes

450.96 --> 454.15999999999997
yeah the flat earth debate was pretty

453.44 --> 458.319
good

454.16 --> 460.56
with ballers again also

458.319 --> 462.319
but yeah i didn't take part in it too

460.56 --> 463.919
much even when i did try to put

462.319 --> 465.52000000000004
something down i started to stumble

463.919 --> 468.87899999999996
again it's very annoying when that

465.52 --> 470.71999999999997
happens it really breaks the effect

468.879 --> 472.96000000000004
of what i'm trying to bring across it's

470.72 --> 476.24
really annoying

472.96 --> 480.0
but yeah like sometimes i'm

476.24 --> 481.36
it just clicks it goes fluid i can focus

480.0 --> 484.4
really well i have a grip

481.36 --> 487.599
and sometimes it's just like

484.4 --> 490.79999999999995
it just doesn't really work out i can't

487.599 --> 492.8
i get too much info for too tight a

490.8 --> 494.96000000000004
route to go and it just

492.8 --> 496.40000000000003
yeah gets shaken up it's very annoying

494.96 --> 500.479
when that happens

496.4 --> 500.479
but i have very little control over it

500.8 --> 505.68
except i guess by how i manage myself

503.919 --> 507.52
and my life

505.68 --> 509.599
that will have an influence on it but

507.52 --> 511.84
it's all long-term influence i just try

509.599 --> 514.88
to on average do my best

511.84 --> 515.919
but everything i do of course echoes on

514.88 --> 519.68
in

515.919 --> 523.5989999999999
in my being and how focused i am and

519.68 --> 527.279
how angry i get very easily distracted

523.599 --> 527.279
all that yeah right so anyway

532.839 --> 536.8000000000001
hey

534.399 --> 538.08
california is crazy indeed by the way

536.8 --> 541.519
good servant

538.08 --> 545.279
uh right yesterday

541.519 --> 548.32
owen benjamin was live again and he had

545.279 --> 552.959
personal dr rachel fulton

548.32 --> 556.32
brown very fascinating lady

552.959 --> 559.5999999999999
like oh yeah

556.32 --> 562.8000000000001
just that's a woman with style

559.6 --> 566.8000000000001
that i like and she's a great

562.8 --> 569.76
great intense explainer

566.8 --> 570.16
with great ideas really well developed

569.76 --> 572.16
ah

570.16 --> 573.6
unfortunately though like the recording

572.16 --> 575.68
kept cutting out

573.6 --> 577.9200000000001
and it seems own benjamin wasn't too

575.68 --> 581.68
bothered by it he did

577.92 --> 583.8389999999999
follow the train of thought but yeah

581.68 --> 586.3199999999999
it was really tough to follow at times

583.839 --> 587.12
like at least half her points were just

586.32 --> 589.519
completely

587.12 --> 590.48
erased because you just can't i couldn't

589.519 --> 592.9590000000001
catch on because

590.48 --> 595.76
half of it cut out and then yeah she

592.959 --> 599.04
speaks really compactly

595.76 --> 600.8
so every word matters in the context and

599.04 --> 605.8389999999999
yeah that was kind of

600.8 --> 605.8389999999999
real i was sad that she kept cutting out

605.92 --> 610.16
i asked big bear like does she record it

608.32 --> 611.36
from her side i certainly hope so

610.16 --> 613.68
because

611.36 --> 615.36
then you might get that recording and

613.68 --> 619.8389999999999
sync it up with the show and that

615.36 --> 619.839
yeah may save it

621.6 --> 624.48
nice mirror

625.6 --> 636.0
uh oh roger that sounds pretty cool

632.48 --> 638.64
i might be up for that but i'd need some

636.0 --> 640.56
transport though

638.64 --> 642.959
i'm not gonna go through public

640.56 --> 645.92
transport

642.959 --> 648.4799999999999
not while this stupid corona situation

645.92 --> 648.4799999999999
is happening

652.0 --> 655.839
i am not going on my bike all the way

654.0 --> 657.92
over there to

655.839 --> 661.839
potential rain and all that but i like

657.92 --> 661.8389999999999
the idea

666.56 --> 675.8389999999999
past the touches on the left side one

679.12 --> 685.36
right oh you've heard the new narrative

682.0 --> 688.56
right guns have never owned our own peak

685.36 --> 691.04
it's china of course with directed

688.56 --> 695.8389999999999
energy weapons from satellites

691.04 --> 695.8389999999999
it's a new thing it's the new story

696.0 --> 700.959
because yeah the thing the way things

698.8 --> 704.8
going

700.959 --> 707.3599999999999
like where before

704.8 --> 708.959
like there is like this cover trade war

707.36 --> 712.24
and media war

708.959 --> 713.1199999999999
not so covert except maybe covert two

712.24 --> 716.16
normies that are

713.12 --> 718.9590000000001
not that right there's

716.16 --> 721.04
that war going on with china and between

718.959 --> 722.399
america and china and globalism and all

721.04 --> 724.8
that

722.399 --> 728.399
especially china well it's it's gonna go

724.8 --> 731.4399999999999
to a more cold war-like state now

728.399 --> 733.279
i think i don't think there's gonna be

731.44 --> 736.48
any hot wars yet

733.279 --> 737.12
if ever but it just looks like it's

736.48 --> 740.16
gonna be

737.12 --> 743.519
pointing fingers and getting

740.16 --> 746.48
all beefed up and [ __ ]

743.519 --> 747.76
for america and china also through the

746.48 --> 749.519
media probably

747.76 --> 751.92
i think it's gonna go to a cold war

749.519 --> 756.48
situation and i think america has just

751.92 --> 756.4799999999999
brought forth satellite directed energy

756.839 --> 762.24
weapons

759.2 --> 763.519
as a new vantage point to start building

762.24 --> 766.16
that

763.519 --> 766.16
what do you think

766.8 --> 773.8389999999999
was it too early for you i don't know

774.399 --> 780.88
right anyway uh that was owen benjamin

777.76 --> 781.8389999999999
yesterday with dr rachel fulton brown it

780.88 --> 784.88
was pretty good it was

781.839 --> 785.44
mostly about lord of the rings analogies

784.88 --> 789.76
compared

785.44 --> 793.2790000000001
it was like esoteric

789.76 --> 796.399
explanation of

793.279 --> 798.0
yeah a lot of it and cross-referencing

796.399 --> 801.76
it with the bible

798.0 --> 804.16
of yeah of tolkien's legacy

801.76 --> 807.36
and yeah it was great i love that [ __ ]

804.16 --> 809.68
there's so much to it

807.36 --> 810.48
it's yeah this woman is obviously very

809.68 --> 813.04
focused

810.48 --> 817.12
on that i've never really expanded too

813.04 --> 819.199
much in that specifically i'm much more

817.12 --> 821.519
yeah focus on everything at the same

819.199 --> 822.079
time but i will definitely recognize

821.519 --> 824.399
traits

822.079 --> 825.199
when i see it like with the bible as

824.399 --> 826.88
well it's like

825.199 --> 829.76
i kind of sort of have that with the

826.88 --> 832.079
bible

829.76 --> 833.76
even though yeah i'm not so much i i'm

832.079 --> 835.5999999999999
not so much a reader that's just going

833.76 --> 836.56
to read every freaking part and then

835.6 --> 838.639
puzzle out

836.56 --> 839.8389999999999
every esoteric aspect about every

838.639 --> 843.12
freaking part

839.839 --> 845.6800000000001
but when i face it i leave it to

843.12 --> 846.32
chance i leave it to the outside world

845.68 --> 850.2399999999999
or

846.32 --> 853.0400000000001
to just coincidental moods or something

850.24 --> 855.04
to be confronted with aspects of it but

853.04 --> 859.36
yeah every time i do

855.04 --> 861.5999999999999
so it it always turns out like

859.36 --> 862.48
sheesh there's always so much compact

861.6 --> 864.399
meaning

862.48 --> 866.0790000000001
in these things you can never take it

864.399 --> 871.199
for superficial

866.079 --> 875.04
or i can't i feel that i can

871.199 --> 877.199
uh right so after that

875.04 --> 878.8
it was much later though much later i i

877.199 --> 881.3599999999999
stayed up way too late guys

878.8 --> 885.12
four o'clock is bad it's not good when i

881.36 --> 887.44
do that

885.12 --> 888.5600000000001
we can talk about the bible whenever you

887.44 --> 891.2790000000001
want

888.56 --> 893.68
sure good servant but i do have a lot of

891.279 --> 896.24
problems with people

893.68 --> 899.8389999999999
that that follow the bible and i've

896.24 --> 899.839
noticed that just more and more

902.16 --> 906.639
not yeah but not all of them because

904.32 --> 908.8000000000001
it's it's really so much about the

906.639 --> 913.519
attitude

908.8 --> 917.4399999999999
like the consequences of what you see

913.519 --> 921.12
not so much just literally obeying

917.44 --> 923.1990000000001
the conclusion to whatever you see right

921.12 --> 926.24
it's really to me more about the

923.199 --> 928.639
frequency and yeah some things are just

926.24 --> 930.72
on the surface will make you believe and

928.639 --> 932.72
accept things that should probably not

930.72 --> 936.0790000000001
be believed and accepted

932.72 --> 936.0790000000001
i'm not talking broadly

937.12 --> 943.839
that yeah

940.72 --> 946.24
that is something that i try to prevent

943.839 --> 949.0400000000001
it's really a natural consequence of

946.24 --> 952.8
being very exoteric

949.04 --> 952.8
always taking things

952.959 --> 957.68
literal and not like literal but in the

955.759 --> 960.72
spot

957.68 --> 963.5999999999999
and making it more physical oriented

960.72 --> 965.1990000000001
about specific actions and all that

963.6 --> 968.639
instead of

965.199 --> 971.12
digging into the the wider meaning of it

968.639 --> 973.44
and then maybe because of that con yeah

971.12 --> 976.639
and cross-referencing with logos

973.44 --> 979.2790000000001
natural logos and christ's path

976.639 --> 981.04
and what he says then figuring out wait

979.279 --> 983.759
no

981.04 --> 985.4399999999999
right and this is all about personal

983.759 --> 987.6
moral reflection

985.44 --> 989.519
so it's not even about figuring out

987.6 --> 991.839
whether the prophecy is true

989.519 --> 992.72
that kind of journey but really it's all

991.839 --> 996.0
about

992.72 --> 999.6
fine tuning how things work how

996.0 --> 1001.92
moral works how logos works

999.6 --> 1002.88
and then yeah exit terrorism becomes a

1001.92 --> 1006.079
trap

1002.88 --> 1009.199
you need the esoteric approach

1006.079 --> 1010.56
to properly balance out and realize the

1009.199 --> 1013.279
frequencies of everything you're going

1010.56 --> 1016.399
to be confronted with

1013.279 --> 1019.92
hey amanda young by the way

1016.399 --> 1023.199
right but anyway after that glow busters

1019.92 --> 1025.039
it was yeah on wednesday right

1023.199 --> 1026.959
but it was a very interesting

1025.039 --> 1027.679
interesting show they had the french guy

1026.959 --> 1031.039
on

1027.679 --> 1034.16
very very much trouble speaking

1031.039 --> 1036.079
english not like that

1034.16 --> 1038.0
but yeah he had a lot of trouble with it

1036.079 --> 1039.4389999999999
was searching for words a lot so he was

1038.0 --> 1043.919
definitely not used to it

1039.439 --> 1046.799
but it was all about maps in this case

1043.919 --> 1049.039
maps and magnetics and the time zones it

1046.799 --> 1050.32
was very extensive presentation with a

1049.039 --> 1053.52
lot of talking and

1050.32 --> 1056.1599999999999
asking questions in between it it was

1053.52 --> 1059.6
kind of fascinating

1056.16 --> 1061.1200000000001
because mostly focused all of it on the

1059.6 --> 1065.76
northern

1061.12 --> 1069.9189999999999
part of the realm north of the equator

1065.76 --> 1072.72
and just how the land layouts

1069.919 --> 1074.72
are and he revealed that yeah they're

1072.72 --> 1077.6000000000001
very different ways of

1074.72 --> 1078.88
showing how the land masses are

1077.6 --> 1082.7199999999998
orientated

1078.88 --> 1082.72
and they they literally warped

1083.52 --> 1089.9189999999999
the model for the map layout

1086.64 --> 1092.7990000000002
to do that it's very fascinating

1089.919 --> 1094.0800000000002
it's very detailed presentation i i

1092.799 --> 1096.08
normally yeah normally

1094.08 --> 1098.1599999999999
i'm going to be honest but normally i'm

1096.08 --> 1100.559
not really a big fan of glowbusters in

1098.16 --> 1100.559
general

1101.2 --> 1104.799
yeah especially when they go general

1102.799 --> 1108.6399999999999
talking but this presentation was just

1104.799 --> 1111.9189999999999
really detailed and broad

1108.64 --> 1114.24
like this was bordering doing

1111.919 --> 1116.24
research about spatial looping and

1114.24 --> 1120.0
linearity like

1116.24 --> 1123.84
it was so detailed and i liked it

1120.0 --> 1126.32
and i stuck around compared some things

1123.84 --> 1126.32
in chat

1127.36 --> 1130.08
in d live

1130.96 --> 1134.8400000000001
but it is interesting because it it kind

1133.12 --> 1137.039
of

1134.84 --> 1139.12
suggests one of the things that really

1137.039 --> 1142.16
stood out to me is that

1139.12 --> 1142.1599999999999
as it looked

1142.799 --> 1146.24
in one of the projections it's like

1145.039 --> 1150.16
greenland

1146.24 --> 1153.76
isn't east of

1150.16 --> 1157.679
canada it's north of canada

1153.76 --> 1162.0
it's right above it spatially

1157.679 --> 1162.0
very strange to realize that

1163.12 --> 1166.2399999999998
and like uh

1166.48 --> 1169.2
let's say it again

1174.24 --> 1181.679
yeah admit in between africa and asia

1178.0 --> 1184.799
that was also very much twisted

1181.679 --> 1188.0800000000002
but it made a lot of sense though but

1184.799 --> 1188.08
that means that there's just

1188.4 --> 1191.5590000000002
the way maps are all presented that

1190.48 --> 1194.4
means that there are

1191.559 --> 1195.84
orientation issues in these specific

1194.4 --> 1199.52
points that you must

1195.84 --> 1201.1999999999998
know what is real you must know what

1199.52 --> 1202.8799999999999
direction to go because if you're going

1201.2 --> 1206.48
to go by the map you could get

1202.88 --> 1209.0390000000002
so lost so terribly lost now of course

1206.48 --> 1209.52
these days we have gps and all that so

1209.039 --> 1212.8799999999999
they'll

1209.52 --> 1212.8799999999999
take care of that for you

1213.2 --> 1216.799
they don't care about how the maps look

1215.2 --> 1220.32
they just go with the real

1216.799 --> 1222.1589999999999
euclidean data

1220.32 --> 1223.6789999999999
but it is fascinating and it kind of

1222.159 --> 1227.5200000000002
left open to

1223.679 --> 1227.52
the whole that projection that

1228.64 --> 1235.039
the earth might not literally be

1232.0 --> 1238.72
yeah a geometrical literal disc

1235.039 --> 1242.1589999999999
it might be sort of like a a demisphere

1238.72 --> 1244.24
a bowl like that

1242.159 --> 1246.4
because yeah there's still issues with

1244.24 --> 1247.6
the southern hemisphere now it's

1246.4 --> 1250.48
definitely not

1247.6 --> 1252.1589999999999
going to return back into a bowl the

1250.48 --> 1255.52
arctic is pretty big

1252.159 --> 1258.64
but yeah as other map attempts of

1255.52 --> 1260.6399999999999
flat earthers revealed it's kind of

1258.64 --> 1263.679
unlikely

1260.64 --> 1266.5590000000002
with what we figured out so far

1263.679 --> 1268.3200000000002
at least not 100 sure about what it

1266.559 --> 1271.9189999999999
should be exactly that

1268.32 --> 1275.12
the arctic the antarctic

1271.919 --> 1278.64
could technically not fit

1275.12 --> 1281.9189999999999
all of the land masses

1278.64 --> 1284.96
roughly within the realm

1281.919 --> 1286.4
it's it it should be a lot

1284.96 --> 1288.4
bigger in order for that to

1286.4 --> 1291.6000000000001
geometrically fit

1288.4 --> 1294.88
well it's not small enough to then yeah

1291.6 --> 1299.039
to conclude oh what must be a ball no no

1294.88 --> 1302.0800000000002
but it could be like a bowl

1299.039 --> 1305.039
so that one it's like half a sphere

1302.08 --> 1305.76
sort of until the equator and then

1305.039 --> 1309.44
instead of

1305.76 --> 1311.679
returning to a sphere it becomes more

1309.44 --> 1312.88
linear in space but it's still very

1311.679 --> 1316.8400000000001
weird again

1312.88 --> 1318.0
because yeah all these things these

1316.84 --> 1321.6789999999999
elements

1318.0 --> 1323.36
despite everything being very much flat

1321.679 --> 1324.72
just goes to show there's something

1323.36 --> 1328.32
confusing going on

1324.72 --> 1330.64
with space like this is already a great

1328.32 --> 1334.3999999999999
sign that space is just not linear

1330.64 --> 1336.48
because how can it be sort of spherical

1334.4 --> 1338.24
or flat or however you see it starting

1336.48 --> 1340.48
out flat then getting sort of

1338.24 --> 1340.48
less

1341.52 --> 1347.12
less in circumference

1345.039 --> 1348.64
even though yeah it's not even literally

1347.12 --> 1350.8799999999999
spherical it's all flat

1348.64 --> 1353.2800000000002
and then becoming sort of straight like

1350.88 --> 1353.2800000000002
a bowl

1353.76 --> 1357.679
that's one of the things that i started

1355.28 --> 1358.1589999999999
to see in that map projection more and

1357.679 --> 1361.8400000000001
more

1358.159 --> 1361.8400000000001
because it is all flat but

1363.28 --> 1370.1589999999999
it's not like a pancake the space

1367.52 --> 1372.48
within the flat realm even if it is

1370.159 --> 1372.96
literally circular in some way and could

1372.48 --> 1376.64
still

1372.96 --> 1380.48
turn out to be it doesn't all just

1376.64 --> 1381.5200000000002
fit as if it is a pancake it doesn't fit

1380.48 --> 1385.039
in there

1381.52 --> 1389.84
what we've seen so yeah

1385.039 --> 1389.84
this nice challenge from the designer

1400.88 --> 1404.48
real southern to end of the mouse south

1403.44 --> 1408.96
of it to a shrimp

1404.48 --> 1411.2
it could be could be guns of nephron

1408.96 --> 1412.64
well they're definitely not eager to get

1411.2 --> 1416.0
all the data

1412.64 --> 1417.919
about it in the wider public that's for

1416.0 --> 1420.32
sure

1417.919 --> 1422.5590000000002
they want us to buy the story that they

1420.32 --> 1424.48
represent about it

1422.559 --> 1431.84
and they're not really answering too

1424.48 --> 1431.84
many questions

1449.919 --> 1453.44
right or like a sound bowl george

1452.32 --> 1456.6399999999999
sanford

1453.44 --> 1458.64
like the ones i have

1456.64 --> 1459.919
starts to make me yeah maybe i should

1458.64 --> 1473.8400000000001
show it again

1459.919 --> 1473.8400000000001
i had that thing for a long time

1476.72 --> 1486.96
it kind of makes you think doesn't it

1480.08 --> 1490.48
kind of really makes you think

1486.96 --> 1492.96
remember the magnetics that glowbusters

1490.48 --> 1496.24
even showed

1492.96 --> 1498.559
the magnetic system within the

1496.24 --> 1499.679
the north the north part north of the

1498.559 --> 1504.32
equator

1499.679 --> 1507.44
yeah it seems like the tibetans

1504.32 --> 1515.84
that made this i think it is tibetan i

1507.44 --> 1515.8400000000001
think they knew

1515.919 --> 1518.64
wouldn't you say

1519.6 --> 1523.84
weird by the way because the other side

1522.4 --> 1529.1200000000001
also

1523.84 --> 1543.84
has a print on it

1529.12 --> 1543.84
and a couple of scratches unfortunately

1546.29 --> 1549.3899999999999
[Music]

1553.2 --> 1557.8400000000001
so yeah maybe the earth is

1559.6 --> 1572.32
like a bowl yeah thanks guns have never

1571.12 --> 1575.36
on rp it's

1572.32 --> 1577.52
yeah it's it's weird oh i got that i got

1575.36 --> 1580.32
that and a big crystal from a shop that

1577.52 --> 1583.36
i could not find back later

1580.32 --> 1599.84
it's almost like like god it in the

1583.36 --> 1599.84
other dimension or something

1610.4 --> 1615.2
bulletproof vest i don't know if that's

1612.4 --> 1617.52
gonna be of use anymore you know

1615.2 --> 1618.88
they got projected energy weapons so it

1617.52 --> 1619.6
doesn't really matter what you're gonna

1618.88 --> 1623.0390000000002
be wearing

1619.6 --> 1623.039
it's just gonna go right through

1624.559 --> 1627.84
unless you got like a

1627.919 --> 1631.8400000000001
yeah specific insulation against that

1630.64 --> 1634.3200000000002
effect

1631.84 --> 1641.84
if that's even possible you would have

1634.32 --> 1641.84
to be completely covered up

1653.2 --> 1657.919
maybe the earth is flat and stationary

1655.919 --> 1659.6000000000001
with much more land

1657.919 --> 1662.0800000000002
well that's the funny thing too about

1659.6 --> 1662.08
this bowl

1664.159 --> 1672.88
the way it looks

1669.84 --> 1674.48
like if this is the northern hemisphere

1672.88 --> 1676.48
let's just call it like that

1674.48 --> 1678.48
and this is the southern hemisphere what

1676.48 --> 1683.84
is all this

1678.48 --> 1683.84
what's all that space

1684.799 --> 1691.44
why is it not filled up in here when it

1688.08 --> 1691.4399999999998
is on the outside here

1693.52 --> 1699.12
right well maybe i'm looking too much

1696.64 --> 1699.1200000000001
into it

1700.88 --> 1705.8400000000001
but yeah there there's always there's

1703.84 --> 1707.12
always an option for more space it's

1705.84 --> 1710.1589999999999
very likely

1707.12 --> 1710.1589999999999
i even figured

1712.24 --> 1720.0
that yeah through these spatial looping

1715.84 --> 1720.0
system what could be possible

1720.32 --> 1724.0
is that there is that the entire

1723.44 --> 1727.2
physical

1724.0 --> 1730.32
realm is like a huge

1727.2 --> 1733.6000000000001
huge landmass

1730.32 --> 1738.1589999999999
but that landmass is basically cut off

1733.6 --> 1740.32
cut up not

1738.159 --> 1742.3200000000002
literally they're not literally cut off

1740.32 --> 1746.559
and then displaced somewhere else

1742.32 --> 1749.6
no they're cut off from each other

1746.559 --> 1752.72
through spatial loop

1749.6 --> 1756.24
cut off so how do

1752.72 --> 1756.24
yeah i could try to draw this

1760.559 --> 1767.84
all right

1772.72 --> 1777.84
so let's just say

1776.32 --> 1780.08
i don't know if you can see this pro i

1777.84 --> 1783.4399999999998
have to check it for obs ah you barely

1780.08 --> 1785.9189999999999
see it uh it's a box with

1783.44 --> 1789.1200000000001
nine squares in it basically well if

1785.919 --> 1792.5590000000002
this is completely invisible

1789.12 --> 1793.279
middle square if that was our earth

1792.559 --> 1795.6
realm

1793.279 --> 1797.6
and it's looped from east to west

1795.6 --> 1800.48
potentially north to south

1797.6 --> 1801.279
something else and it's looping in on

1800.48 --> 1804.64
itself

1801.279 --> 1808.08
even though physically beyond the east

1804.64 --> 1811.5200000000002
or west or north or south there could be

1808.08 --> 1812.72
more land but you can't reach it because

1811.52 --> 1815.679
you're going to loop in

1812.72 --> 1816.72
on the other side because that loop is

1815.679 --> 1821.3600000000001
set

1816.72 --> 1825.279
but if the loop could be altered

1821.36 --> 1826.08
then maybe instead yeah the loop might

1825.279 --> 1828.159
just

1826.08 --> 1829.4399999999998
open up it would seem like a portal

1828.159 --> 1832.88
would open up

1829.44 --> 1833.2
into the other realm segment so instead

1832.88 --> 1837.7600000000002
of

1833.2 --> 1840.0800000000002
going into the loop on the other side

1837.76 --> 1841.36
suddenly you go into the other realm

1840.08 --> 1843.9189999999999
with its own loop

1841.36 --> 1843.9189999999999
confine

1844.72 --> 1851.84
right so just to keep it sort of simple

1855.2 --> 1865.8400000000001
i hope this is a little bit more visible

1871.039 --> 1877.679
right so over here

1875.36 --> 1880.1589999999999
you have the separated segments they're

1877.679 --> 1883.44
spatially looping in on themselves

1880.159 --> 1887.919
on the other side you can see suddenly

1883.44 --> 1887.919
there is a connection the loop is opened

1888.32 --> 1894.24
see this is a potential mechanical

1891.919 --> 1896.0800000000002
possibility if looping space is a real

1894.24 --> 1899.519
thing

1896.08 --> 1901.6789999999999
would seem all very magical

1899.519 --> 1902.799
to those that wouldn't understand how

1901.679 --> 1904.88
things really work

1902.799 --> 1906.6399999999999
that overlook that there is looping if

1904.88 --> 1908.72
there was a something that could be done

1906.64 --> 1911.2
with it or if there is something that

1908.72 --> 1913.279
naturally occur occurs because of the

1911.2 --> 1916.96
astrological cycles you know

1913.279 --> 1920.08
maybe like the space itself just

1916.96 --> 1923.2
oscillates and at certain periods

1920.08 --> 1926.559
suddenly the loop confined

1923.2 --> 1927.919
over yeah like an oscillation sometimes

1926.559 --> 1930.799
it might hit

1927.919 --> 1932.48
the other loop when it is like in that

1930.799 --> 1934.1589999999999
form of oscillation and then there's a

1932.48 --> 1937.3600000000001
connection for the time being

1934.159 --> 1939.279
until it retracts again so

1937.36 --> 1941.1999999999998
that it could even be that things

1939.279 --> 1942.88
naturally open and close like that

1941.2 --> 1945.76
almost like the tides

1942.88 --> 1947.279
the loops to the other realms could

1945.76 --> 1950.799
periodically open

1947.279 --> 1953.279
in an oscillated fashion

1950.799 --> 1953.279
i know

1954.24 --> 1957.36
yeah and if look if this all doesn't

1956.159 --> 1960.0800000000002
work out at

1957.36 --> 1961.6789999999999
least i got a great foundation for for

1960.08 --> 1965.519
science fiction here

1961.679 --> 1965.519
i do i like it

1973.84 --> 1977.12
but yeah did that explanation make any

1975.84 --> 1980.24
sense to people

1977.12 --> 1980.2399999999998
do you understand this

1981.12 --> 1987.6
no connection connection

1984.88 --> 1988.7990000000002
like the lines are not literally

1987.6 --> 1993.4399999999998
physical barriers

1988.799 --> 1993.44
they are looping in on itself

1998.48 --> 2006.799
right just like one of those video games

2003.44 --> 2010.3200000000002
you go over there go over there and then

2006.799 --> 2013.679
you end up here you go over there

2010.32 --> 2019.84
and you end up here like that

2013.679 --> 2019.8400000000001
that yeah exactly like that

2024.01 --> 2030.84
[Music]

2026.88 --> 2033.8400000000001
looping aspect between two concrete

2030.84 --> 2033.84
images

2037.039 --> 2041.76
what represents the looping aspects well

2039.2 --> 2041.76
the lines

2042.24 --> 2048.8
it's like this inside the lines

2045.6 --> 2053.04
is space outside the lines

2048.8 --> 2053.04
is no space there's no physical realm

2055.28 --> 2061.679
and the lines themselves are looping

2058.399 --> 2074.56
they are the virtual loop

2061.679 --> 2077.839
edge between the space

2074.56 --> 2082.0789999999997
that's kind of funny because like that

2077.839 --> 2086.839
if i try to keep it the pattern complete

2082.079 --> 2088.0
then i would say that if there was an

2086.839 --> 2090.639
opening

2088.0 --> 2091.28
to the north for example to a potential

2090.639 --> 2094.079
other

2091.28 --> 2095.9190000000003
realm segment in the north if there

2094.079 --> 2098.079
would be an opening that means that that

2095.919 --> 2101.359
spot

2098.079 --> 2103.599
is closed to the other side

2101.359 --> 2105.7599999999998
because it's not connected anymore it

2103.599 --> 2108.88
instead connects to something else

2105.76 --> 2111.5200000000004
so then the two darker spots that i drew

2108.88 --> 2112.4
either there would be some kind of

2111.52 --> 2115.44
barrier like

2112.4 --> 2119.2000000000003
bunk or it would actually loop

2115.44 --> 2123.119
even onto the other side as well

2119.2 --> 2123.1189999999997
it all depends on the nature of how this

2128.839 --> 2131.839
works

2142.839 --> 2145.839
see

2147.44 --> 2159.839
let me see you what

2151.04 --> 2159.839
are you talking about eminem

2169.119 --> 2173.839
all right but wouldn't that be weird

2177.28 --> 2181.6800000000003
if there's just it's like

2183.28 --> 2189.3590000000004
you know i'm just thinking a little bit

2186.64 --> 2190.3199999999997
softly inside my own head about the

2189.359 --> 2194.16
concept

2190.32 --> 2196.56
like it might be that where the loop

2194.16 --> 2199.5989999999997
typically opens and closes those might

2196.56 --> 2202.72
be set places even

2199.599 --> 2203.119
they would be the virtual edges of the

2202.72 --> 2204.9599999999996
realm

2203.119 --> 2206.2400000000002
even though it's looping in on itself so

2204.96 --> 2208.7200000000003
you don't really see it

2206.24 --> 2210.24
until an opening forms but it should be

2208.72 --> 2213.2799999999997
logical that the openings

2210.24 --> 2215.9199999999996
always form at the same locations and

2213.28 --> 2218.96
that they would automatically interlock

2215.92 --> 2218.96
however they open

2219.839 --> 2224.0789999999997
with the other realm segment as is as if

2222.16 --> 2227.52
it has always been which it has

2224.079 --> 2230.32
it's just that it gets cut off

2227.52 --> 2231.68
sometimes and then that cutoff which is

2230.32 --> 2235.599
spatial

2231.68 --> 2238.0789999999997
subtly isn't cut off anymore

2235.599 --> 2239.599
it opens up might be there's a couple of

2238.079 --> 2240.32
earthquakes or something when that

2239.599 --> 2242.48
happens

2240.32 --> 2244.7200000000003
suddenly material starts to interconnect

2242.48 --> 2244.72
again

2245.839 --> 2249.359
like different material from the yeah

2248.32 --> 2252.6400000000003
then from the

2249.359 --> 2254.64
loop to the other side as it were

2252.64 --> 2258.16
but it might very well be that the loops

2254.64 --> 2260.8799999999997
will typically arrive in a set

2258.16 --> 2262.64
couple of coordinates so maybe if there

2260.88 --> 2265.04
is an east to west loop

2262.64 --> 2265.7599999999998
opening to another realm segment east or

2265.04 --> 2267.2799999999997
west

2265.76 --> 2268.8390000000004
east and west it's very hard to

2267.28 --> 2272.5600000000004
determine like that

2268.839 --> 2274.88
uh then

2272.56 --> 2277.52
maybe that's for example somewhere in

2274.88 --> 2277.52
the pacific

2277.599 --> 2285.839
maybe it is even the pacific rim

2280.16 --> 2285.839
somewhere over there

2288.16 --> 2294.72
and yeah any northern

2291.2 --> 2296.56
realm loop segment ending where it could

2294.72 --> 2298.0789999999997
interconnect is probably going to be at

2296.56 --> 2302.4
least that

2298.079 --> 2302.4
at the presumed north pole

2303.76 --> 2308.96
and maybe somewhere at the arctic as

2307.52 --> 2311.92
well if there is

2308.96 --> 2313.76
such a segment maybe it's already open

2311.92 --> 2315.28
maybe that's the passage to the other

2313.76 --> 2318.96
world or something

2315.28 --> 2318.96
we hear rumors about sometimes

2324.839 --> 2327.839
huh

2330.079 --> 2337.599
speed of time i got now

2333.92 --> 2337.599
look time is just a concept

2338.8 --> 2343.92
spatial looping might simply be a

2340.72 --> 2343.9199999999996
physical necessity

2346.88 --> 2350.079
ew toady

2352.24 --> 2355.839
you're such a perv dude

2368.24 --> 2374.3199999999997
magnetic declinations could play part in

2371.04 --> 2374.32
the looping directions

2378.56 --> 2384.16
dude i don't know

2382.32 --> 2385.52
well look if all these things are

2384.16 --> 2388.56
natural

2385.52 --> 2390.0
and not artificially mechanical then

2388.56 --> 2392.24
it's very likely

2390.0 --> 2393.119
like as in part of the original design

2392.24 --> 2396.3999999999996
it's all likely

2393.119 --> 2400.1600000000003
everything is tied in with one another

2396.4 --> 2403.28
the magnetics the celestial bodies

2400.16 --> 2405.2799999999997
the electric ether

2403.28 --> 2407.6800000000003
and then maybe the spatial looping as

2405.28 --> 2411.3590000000004
well maybe they're all tied into

2407.68 --> 2413.7599999999998
a singular thing like basically

2411.359 --> 2416.48
writing of the same patterns of the same

2413.76 --> 2416.48
energy source

2416.56 --> 2425.52
could be

2424.0 --> 2439.839
welcome to my chat by the way good to

2425.52 --> 2439.839
see you here

2455.68 --> 2462.48
yeah it it also

2458.96 --> 2462.8
yeah makes me consider other things as

2462.48 --> 2465.92
well

2462.8 --> 2467.44
remember the conception of the supposed

2465.92 --> 2471.28
babylonian tower

2467.44 --> 2474.319
that reached up then suddenly

2471.28 --> 2475.599
energy and energy field was distorted

2474.319 --> 2478.88
somehow

2475.599 --> 2480.0
it dropped causing people to be subtly

2478.88 --> 2483.359
forced to

2480.0 --> 2484.8
learn how to verbally speak when before

2483.359 --> 2487.359
they could make sounds they could

2484.8 --> 2487.3590000000004
probably

2487.44 --> 2493.52
sing express themselves all that

2491.68 --> 2495.44
but they would communicate

2493.52 --> 2497.52
telepathically and that's why everybody

2495.44 --> 2500.48
could speak the same language

2497.52 --> 2500.96
and then suddenly when they did that

2500.48 --> 2503.92
yeah

2500.96 --> 2505.52
they lost that ability and then suddenly

2503.92 --> 2506.2400000000002
they had to learn languages and that's

2505.52 --> 2509.52
how every

2506.24 --> 2514.64
everything fragmented well

2509.52 --> 2516.8
maybe if they had pushed it even further

2514.64 --> 2518.16
like if they could have despite that

2516.8 --> 2520.0
setback continued

2518.16 --> 2521.92
they probably just knew like okay this

2520.0 --> 2523.599
is just bad news after that happened

2521.92 --> 2525.6800000000003
it's like a huge curse like

2523.599 --> 2527.3590000000004
suddenly we can't talk anymore it's like

2525.68 --> 2528.72
massive punishment from god

2527.359 --> 2531.04
that's how everyone would have

2528.72 --> 2533.2799999999997
experienced that well if they had

2531.04 --> 2535.359
pushed it even further then maybe that

2533.28 --> 2538.1600000000003
would have caused like the heavens

2535.359 --> 2538.88
to suddenly disappear the lights to

2538.16 --> 2542.7999999999997
disappear

2538.88 --> 2546.319
and portals to open

2542.8 --> 2548.48
to the other realms maybe that is also

2546.319 --> 2550.0
part of it maybe that is even part of

2548.48 --> 2552.88
the apocalypse

2550.0 --> 2553.44
conception and all that that just if you

2552.88 --> 2555.76
do that

2553.44 --> 2558.0
if you build a giant spike and detract

2555.76 --> 2558.96
the energy maybe that causes the realms

2558.0 --> 2560.48
to other

2558.96 --> 2564.0
this yeah the loop to other realm

2560.48 --> 2567.2
segments to open or the barrier to lift

2564.0 --> 2569.119
partially if you will if you want to see

2567.2 --> 2572.16
it like that

2569.119 --> 2574.2400000000002
and that would let in yeah beings from

2572.16 --> 2579.359
the other realms

2574.24 --> 2583.68
which could be quite messed up

2579.359 --> 2583.68
could be not saying they necessarily are

2584.079 --> 2590.48
they could be very noble compared to

2587.599 --> 2592.2400000000002
earthlings and then see us as like geez

2590.48 --> 2594.72
you are just a bunch of goblins

2592.24 --> 2594.72
all of you

2596.0 --> 2598.24
so

2599.839 --> 2603.52
yeah opening up the realm to another

2601.839 --> 2606.72
segment is always going to be

2603.52 --> 2609.44
a dangerous process

2606.72 --> 2609.7599999999998
i think because it's likely that there's

2609.44 --> 2612.4
just

2609.76 --> 2614.4
other civilizations of maybe completely

2612.4 --> 2616.48
different natures there

2614.4 --> 2618.1600000000003
that are not tied into anything that's

2616.48 --> 2620.72
going down here

2618.16 --> 2624.319
that don't have parasitic satanic elites

2620.72 --> 2624.319
trying to make everybody [ __ ]

2625.2 --> 2628.96
and maybe they've never had that maybe

2627.119 --> 2630.48
they never had that for thousands of

2628.96 --> 2633.76
years and they just have this

2630.48 --> 2634.64
pinnacle high culture where then they're

2633.76 --> 2637.5200000000004
mentally

2634.64 --> 2638.0
and spiritually on levels that would

2637.52 --> 2642.079
just

2638.0 --> 2642.079
shock every single individual here

2642.4 --> 2649.359
when we're exposed to that frequency you

2645.44 --> 2663.839
don't know

2649.359 --> 2663.839
you don't know until it happens

2676.16 --> 2679.68
right but george sanford i would say

2678.56 --> 2682.0
look i'm just

2679.68 --> 2684.16
doing this as a designer from a designer

2682.0 --> 2686.24
and even almost from like yeah

2684.16 --> 2687.44
game master's perspective like how would

2686.24 --> 2690.0789999999997
it work

2687.44 --> 2691.119
not saying oh it said this then that

2690.079 --> 2692.7200000000003
happened

2691.119 --> 2694.2400000000002
like in the storytelling mode but just

2692.72 --> 2696.7999999999997
the freaking mechanism

2694.24 --> 2698.64
so maybe building a giant spike will

2696.8 --> 2700.88
indeed cause cataclysm

2698.64 --> 2701.68
but also open up realm segments

2700.88 --> 2705.599
temporarily

2701.68 --> 2707.9199999999996
for how long it will allow

2705.599 --> 2709.44
interaction and potential assimilation

2707.92 --> 2713.04
of some kinds or if

2709.44 --> 2715.359
yeah really

2713.04 --> 2716.4
annoying satanic people that have been

2715.359 --> 2718.319
waiting for that might

2716.4 --> 2719.599
use it to try and invade the other

2718.319 --> 2722.64
realms

2719.599 --> 2723.2000000000003
no maybe that is even potentially what

2722.64 --> 2726.72
happened

2723.2 --> 2728.64
with hitler he found a realm

2726.72 --> 2729.7599999999998
opening to the south and then tried to

2728.64 --> 2732.24
go there

2729.76 --> 2733.2000000000003
and then the americans followed remember

2732.24 --> 2736.8799999999997
that

2733.2 --> 2736.8799999999997
we don't know exactly where they went

2737.44 --> 2741.68
well maybe there was this opening

2738.96 --> 2741.68
temporarily

2742.319 --> 2745.599
might happen naturally doesn't

2744.24 --> 2746.8799999999997
necessarily have to happen in a

2745.599 --> 2749.28
disastrous way

2746.88 --> 2751.76
but it could be that if if yeah the

2749.28 --> 2754.96
disastrous way happens then like every

2751.76 --> 2758.6400000000003
every gate is opened for as long as

2754.96 --> 2774.079
the energy remains drained as it were

2758.64 --> 2776.0789999999997
see like a mechanical system like that

2774.079 --> 2779.2000000000003
because they switched around and walking

2776.079 --> 2783.119
forwards essentially back

2779.2 --> 2783.1189999999997
well that would be sign of a closed loop

2784.319 --> 2790.8
that would be

2788.56 --> 2792.16
i might try to imagine it like this if a

2790.8 --> 2795.599
loop

2792.16 --> 2798.7999999999997
ended up in a spike and we've seen that

2795.599 --> 2800.56
in maps if it ended up in a spike

2798.8 --> 2801.8390000000004
then maybe that would happen you would

2800.56 --> 2803.44
go into it

2801.839 --> 2804.88
you go to the east west end up at the

2803.44 --> 2808.2400000000002
same place and then

2804.88 --> 2808.2400000000002
when you hit the point

2809.599 --> 2813.2000000000003
it literally just loops in on itself

2812.079 --> 2818.2400000000002
like every step

2813.2 --> 2821.839
you take goes back into your footprint

2818.24 --> 2825.1189999999997
and if you turn around it also

2821.839 --> 2829.04
goes back into your footprint at that

2825.119 --> 2830.4
absolute end point like anyway you go

2829.04 --> 2834.8
you're just gonna go

2830.4 --> 2836.56
back i don't know

2834.8 --> 2839.3590000000004
this is looping space guys the

2836.56 --> 2845.839
possibilities are just mind-boggling

2839.359 --> 2845.839
if it is a real thing

2863.599 --> 2873.839
well sure tony uk

2866.72 --> 2873.839
something like that

2873.92 --> 2880.64
but you guys do remember that map right

2877.04 --> 2880.64
let's see if i have it on my computer

2884.839 --> 2887.839
still

2891.92 --> 2894.4
let's see

2896.559 --> 2903.52
yeah no where is it

2900.4 --> 2906.64
is it yeah

2903.52 --> 2914.559
i think this is the one

2906.64 --> 2918.0
okay let's see if i can present that

2914.559 --> 2918.0
right this one see

2918.48 --> 2921.119
the points

2924.48 --> 2933.359
is that what it represents is that just

2929.68 --> 2934.0789999999997
the spatial edge you loop in on itself

2933.359 --> 2936.4
you just turn

2934.079 --> 2943.8390000000004
back because of what i described is that

2936.4 --> 2943.839
what that is

2954.4 --> 2961.04
right well tony uk you know this kind of

2957.68 --> 2962.96
the idea of of that the algorithm

2961.04 --> 2964.4
what you said that there's a special way

2962.96 --> 2968.0
you have to enter

2964.4 --> 2972.2400000000002
yeah it reminds me a lot about the

2968.0 --> 2974.48
uh the arthur legend with

2972.24 --> 2975.68
with that special island the secret

2974.48 --> 2978.48
island

2975.68 --> 2981.1189999999997
well maybe you have to basically exert a

2978.48 --> 2982.72
certain frequency in order to bypass the

2981.119 --> 2984.4
loop

2982.72 --> 2986.5589999999997
maybe you have to have a certain type of

2984.4 --> 2987.28
energy level to be able to move beyond

2986.559 --> 2989.52
or you're just

2987.28 --> 2991.28
automatically turning back it's like a

2989.52 --> 2995.44
bridge you can't cross

2991.28 --> 2995.44
unless you're like you got the right

2996.839 --> 3002.72
frequency

2999.28 --> 3006.3190000000004
if it's not obviously a bridge

3002.72 --> 3008.72
then but just a piece of land or ice

3006.319 --> 3010.16
then you won't even know you're crossing

3008.72 --> 3012.72
that bridge and you'll just be

3010.16 --> 3013.52
disoriented as you are suddenly facing

3012.72 --> 3014.9599999999996
the way

3013.52 --> 3017.28
you came even though you didn't turn

3014.96 --> 3017.28
around

3021.16 --> 3024.2599999999998
[Music]

3030.06 --> 3034.23
[Music]

3052.839 --> 3055.839
um

3058.88 --> 3062.8
yeah and by the way the perfect way to

3061.28 --> 3067.119
cover up

3062.8 --> 3070.48
a spatial loop

3067.119 --> 3073.2000000000003
uh point like that a cutoff point like

3070.48 --> 3075.04
that would be

3073.2 --> 3077.839
and it might be very well the case out

3075.04 --> 3080.64
there at the at the south pole at least

3077.839 --> 3081.359
at that region that it's the perfect way

3080.64 --> 3083.359
to cover that

3081.359 --> 3086.4
is if there's just a constant lizard

3083.359 --> 3088.96
there because a constant blizzard

3086.4 --> 3090.48
is going to quickly even out the

3088.96 --> 3092.559
landscape so even if you leave

3090.48 --> 3094.079
footprints or anything or an object

3092.559 --> 3095.599
it's going to get snowed under it's

3094.079 --> 3096.6400000000003
going to get very tough to even get

3095.599 --> 3098.559
there

3096.64 --> 3100.16
and then you go into it hoping you get

3098.559 --> 3102.6400000000003
on the other side and then you

3100.16 --> 3105.2
get out of it the way you came so if

3102.64 --> 3108.4
there's like this constant blizzard

3105.2 --> 3111.1189999999997
going on with snow dust everywhere and

3108.4 --> 3112.88
bad visibility and overall terrible

3111.119 --> 3116.0
circumstances for people to go

3112.88 --> 3118.1600000000003
into that's the perfect way to just

3116.0 --> 3119.92
permanently cover it up

3118.16 --> 3121.68
it would be very hard to figure out

3119.92 --> 3125.839
what's even going on

3121.68 --> 3125.839
like that

3137.28 --> 3141.2000000000003
all right and now i'm my fantasy is

3139.68 --> 3143.44
going a little wild

3141.2 --> 3144.24
now i'm imagining remember those what is

3143.44 --> 3146.96
it

3144.24 --> 3149.1189999999997
a special buddhist priest or something

3146.96 --> 3150.4
shaolin priest that could literally just

3149.119 --> 3151.28
sit somewhere in the middle of a

3150.4 --> 3153.52
blizzard

3151.28 --> 3156.0
and they would have a heat field that

3153.52 --> 3158.16
would just prevent them from freezing up

3156.0 --> 3160.16
maybe that is what it maybe you need

3158.16 --> 3162.0
that specifically

3160.16 --> 3164.24
in order to go through a blizzard

3162.0 --> 3166.319
situation and then actually

3164.24 --> 3169.2
get out of the other side this yeah my

3166.319 --> 3173.04
fantasy is going a little

3169.2 --> 3181.839
a little wild here combining it all

3173.04 --> 3181.839
but hey who knows maybe they can do that

3183.68 --> 3195.7599999999998
no mn don't be

3187.359 --> 3198.96
a dick

3195.76 --> 3198.96
no george stanford

3200.4 --> 3204.559
look there may be spaces in between the

3202.88 --> 3207.04
spaces you know i've had

3204.559 --> 3208.1600000000003
weird experiences like that there might

3207.04 --> 3209.7599999999998
be

3208.16 --> 3211.68
but it would be like a fourth

3209.76 --> 3212.3190000000004
dimensional thing it would simply be

3211.68 --> 3214.7999999999997
extra

3212.319 --> 3216.16
space through that you can't normally

3214.8 --> 3217.76
access

3216.16 --> 3219.68
unless you are tapped into that

3217.76 --> 3220.7200000000003
frequency and then you can literally go

3219.68 --> 3223.1189999999997
to a place where

3220.72 --> 3225.359
regular people won't even see that it's

3223.119 --> 3225.359
there

3228.64 --> 3232.16
but that has nothing to do with spatial

3230.559 --> 3234.88
looping that more has to do with

3232.16 --> 3236.96
extra dimensionality like that the

3234.88 --> 3239.28
fourth dimension might be the actual

3236.96 --> 3241.04
real physical dimension and this is just

3239.28 --> 3242.6400000000003
the part that we normally perceive

3241.04 --> 3244.5589999999997
because of it because you have to have a

3242.64 --> 3247.359
certain level of

3244.559 --> 3248.2400000000002
spiritual ascension in order to even

3247.359 --> 3253.5989999999997
touch

3248.24 --> 3256.5589999999997
that other part something like that

3253.599 --> 3258.079
i'd go with that i well i've almost

3256.559 --> 3265.8390000000004
literally experienced that it's just

3258.079 --> 3265.8390000000004
very confusing

3266.559 --> 3270.96
did they use these protect valley keys

3269.28 --> 3273.0600000000004
in himalayas i don't know

3270.96 --> 3277.599
toady i don't know

3273.06 --> 3279.7599999999998
[Music]

3277.599 --> 3283.599
yeah okay well if you're gonna act like

3279.76 --> 3283.599
that i'm just gonna time you out

3285.2 --> 3290.8799999999997
i'm not and yeah

3288.559 --> 3292.96
i might have done this sort of thing

3290.88 --> 3296.2400000000002
when i was 10 as well

3292.96 --> 3298.799
except then i was i didn't have

3296.24 --> 3301.359
as clear a picture and not enough

3298.799 --> 3301.359
courage

3301.52 --> 3305.52
to actually just start doing this in

3303.599 --> 3308.6400000000003
public

3305.52 --> 3310.4
i would be too trusting of everyone

3308.64 --> 3314.0
i wouldn't realize that there's just a

3310.4 --> 3317.599
whole whole group of people

3314.0 --> 3319.44
that are trying to avoid this

3317.599 --> 3321.839
i didn't realize that when i was that

3319.44 --> 3321.839
young

3338.16 --> 3341.2799999999997
yep iron fe

3345.2 --> 3349.68
well i've experienced that things just

3348.24 --> 3352.319
regular processes

3349.68 --> 3354.319
work can actually start to work

3352.319 --> 3355.68
differently slightly differently in my

3354.319 --> 3363.839
own experience

3355.68 --> 3363.839
if my mood is radically altered

3364.4 --> 3368.319
like for example yeah well thank god

3366.559 --> 3369.76
it's not the case now it hasn't been for

3368.319 --> 3373.04
a long time but if i would

3369.76 --> 3374.96
suddenly drop into a deep depression

3373.04 --> 3376.24
because of some introspective thing and

3374.96 --> 3377.92
i

3376.24 --> 3380.24
basically didn't know what i would yeah

3377.92 --> 3384.0
i wasn't responsible about my own

3380.24 --> 3384.0
spiritual health like that

3384.799 --> 3389.68
then yeah things can just start to work

3388.799 --> 3393.28
differently

3389.68 --> 3396.72
not only like sensations but

3393.28 --> 3399.3590000000004
just like things start to look different

3396.72 --> 3400.24
and is that really visually different or

3399.359 --> 3403.04
is

3400.24 --> 3403.68
just your energy you radiate does that

3403.04 --> 3408.16
alter

3403.68 --> 3410.16
the way certain elements work slightly i

3408.16 --> 3412.64
don't know

3410.16 --> 3414.64
maybe yeah there is already this natural

3412.64 --> 3419.839
effect we just take it for granted we

3414.64 --> 3419.839
don't take notice too much

3422.25 --> 3425.42
[Music]

3430.839 --> 3433.839
topaz

3434.64 --> 3439.68
i don't know toady uk sounds interesting

3437.359 --> 3441.04
i i don't know what what are topas is

3439.68 --> 3447.839
that an animal is that

3441.04 --> 3447.839
a group of people i don't know

3448.16 --> 3453.04
this is a lot of what ifs today yeah

3450.64 --> 3456.5589999999997
that's right

3453.04 --> 3458.319
talking about yeah spatial loop

3456.559 --> 3460.0
mechanics i tried to explain some

3458.319 --> 3462.48
elements about it and then

3460.0 --> 3464.4
yeah now we're proceeding to fantasizing

3462.48 --> 3467.92
yeah where can you already find

3464.4 --> 3469.599
like science fiction like elements of

3467.92 --> 3474.2400000000002
this

3469.599 --> 3477.6800000000003
and what can we compare it to physical

3474.24 --> 3479.52
situations in the realm already isn't it

3477.68 --> 3481.839
fascinating hey look if there is some

3479.52 --> 3484.16
spatial looping going on in some way

3481.839 --> 3486.16
i find that extremely fascinating it's

3484.16 --> 3488.48
almost like

3486.16 --> 3492.16
to me it's like trying to discover

3488.48 --> 3495.2
teleportation well teleportation is just

3492.16 --> 3497.2
not very viable in my opinion but yeah

3495.2 --> 3500.96
spatial looping might actually be

3497.2 --> 3500.96
already a natural part of the realm

3501.28 --> 3504.88
and so who knows what is possible with

3504.4 --> 3507.28
it

3504.88 --> 3508.559
it might very well be worth exploring

3507.28 --> 3511.0400000000004
and who knows

3508.559 --> 3513.52
the elite the technologists might have

3511.04 --> 3515.44
already kind of mastered it

3513.52 --> 3517.04
you know maybe that's how they created

3515.44 --> 3519.28
like portals where you step through and

3517.04 --> 3522.4
then you're somewhere else those

3519.28 --> 3523.0400000000004
cia based stories obviously but who

3522.4 --> 3525.6800000000003
knows

3523.04 --> 3527.04
you know if they figured out how to

3525.68 --> 3528.799
create spatial loopy

3527.04 --> 3530.319
they would call it a wormhole or

3528.799 --> 3532.64
something right

3530.319 --> 3534.319
but may simply be spatial mechanics and

3532.64 --> 3536.64
they just said okay we

3534.319 --> 3538.079
create this and suddenly you have a

3536.64 --> 3540.24
doorway

3538.079 --> 3542.079
who knows what the consequences would be

3540.24 --> 3545.04
by the way of doing that

3542.079 --> 3546.559
energetically might have some dramatic

3545.04 --> 3547.839
impact and maybe that's why they haven't

3546.559 --> 3552.2400000000002
just standardized that

3547.839 --> 3555.359
in some way or that could simply be

3552.24 --> 3558.0789999999997
pure fiction by the cia but

3555.359 --> 3558.48
yeah considering spatial looping going

3558.079 --> 3561.52
on

3558.48 --> 3565.28
potentially it might just have actually

3561.52 --> 3568.0
been something real they just gave

3565.28 --> 3569.28
their technological science fiction

3568.0 --> 3573.839
explanation for it

3569.28 --> 3573.8390000000004
because that's what they like to do

3575.119 --> 3578.4
you're biting your tongue here

3584.96 --> 3589.44
space has no property now this is not

3587.359 --> 3592.88
about

3589.44 --> 3597.2000000000003
literal volume this is about

3592.88 --> 3601.2000000000003
basically the nature of the realm yeah

3597.2 --> 3603.839
spatial looping or warping

3601.2 --> 3606.0
if things are perfectly flat

3603.839 --> 3609.599
geometrically flat

3606.0 --> 3612.64
but the way things are interconnected

3609.599 --> 3614.88
does not turn out to be perfectly

3612.64 --> 3618.5589999999997
geometrically flat

3614.88 --> 3620.2400000000002
then what else could be going on

3618.559 --> 3623.0400000000004
it's definitely not a globe not

3620.24 --> 3624.8799999999997
geometrically literal

3623.04 --> 3626.88
because they're yeah gyroscopes

3624.88 --> 3628.96
gyroscopes don't turn

3626.88 --> 3630.96
when you move north to south for

3628.96 --> 3632.96
starters

3630.96 --> 3634.96
right they don't and they should if the

3632.96 --> 3638.0
earth was a globe but they don't

3634.96 --> 3640.64
but if still it doesn't geometrically

3638.0 --> 3641.44
fit as if it is all literal disk or some

3640.64 --> 3643.839
kind of flat

3641.44 --> 3644.88
surface in the geometricals if it

3643.839 --> 3647.119
doesn't fit

3644.88 --> 3650.559
then yeah what else could be going on

3647.119 --> 3653.2000000000003
then some weird spatial warping effect

3650.559 --> 3654.1600000000003
that just causes everything to not

3653.2 --> 3656.72
geometrically

3654.16 --> 3657.52
literally fit like that and if that is

3656.72 --> 3659.839
the case

3657.52 --> 3661.2
then who knows what else is going on

3659.839 --> 3663.52
concerning spatial

3661.2 --> 3664.48
warping there could be looping

3663.52 --> 3666.799
situations

3664.48 --> 3670.16
and hey looping situations may turn out

3666.799 --> 3672.48
to be absolutely inevitable

3670.16 --> 3673.2799999999997
when we get better acquainted with how

3672.48 --> 3676.16
the realm

3673.28 --> 3678.3190000000004
is laid out is the equator line a

3676.16 --> 3680.64
geometrical literal circle or is it a

3678.319 --> 3682.64
geometrical literal straight line

3680.64 --> 3685.359
that just loops in on itself if it's a

3682.64 --> 3687.2799999999997
literal geometrical straight line

3685.359 --> 3689.119
then we got a weird situation going on

3687.28 --> 3699.8390000000004
that could basically only be

3689.119 --> 3699.839
explained as if the realm was looping

3702.64 --> 3705.7599999999998
they would need energy well look at how

3704.88 --> 3708.96
much energy

3705.76 --> 3712.7990000000004
exists in the realm naturally toady

3708.96 --> 3715.44
it's full of it

3712.799 --> 3717.359
so much of it that it causes magnetics

3715.44 --> 3720.559
to exist

3717.359 --> 3724.0
it's probably feeding the spirit of life

3720.559 --> 3727.8390000000004
to exist and it's probably feeding the

3724.0 --> 3727.839
heavenly bodies to exist

3728.16 --> 3733.2
including the sunlight which is part of

3731.68 --> 3735.7599999999998
the celestial heavenly

3733.2 --> 3736.64
body projection and it's definitely

3735.76 --> 3740.079
energy fed

3736.64 --> 3743.5989999999997
it can yeah it's it's causing energy

3740.079 --> 3745.599
to arrive on earth so there must be

3743.599 --> 3747.92
energy feeding into it

3745.599 --> 3751.6800000000003
into the effect into the manifestation

3747.92 --> 3751.6800000000003
the holographic manifestation

3753.119 --> 3755.839
what is a realm

3756.48 --> 3762.88
a realm is a confined

3760.24 --> 3762.8799999999997
spatial

3763.839 --> 3769.839
place where yeah where we live it's a

3767.039 --> 3769.8390000000004
realm

3772.64 --> 3776.64
where is the projector well the

3774.079 --> 3778.799
projector may be a natural occurrence as

3776.64 --> 3780.96
part of the design it may simply occur

3778.799 --> 3784.0
naturally because of the way things are

3780.96 --> 3786.2400000000002
set up the mechanics of the realm design

3784.0 --> 3787.039
and the energy present it may simply

3786.24 --> 3789.359
cause

3787.039 --> 3792.4
the heavenly bodies as a natural effect

3789.359 --> 3792.4
it seems like that

3792.72 --> 3797.359
at least right anyway i'm gonna round

3796.4 --> 3799.44

3797.359 --> 3800.72
