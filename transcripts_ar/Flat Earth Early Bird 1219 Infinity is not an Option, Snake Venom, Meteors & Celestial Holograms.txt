uh well today is

137.94 --> 143.76
[Music]

astounding so for some reason

143.76 --> 149.35999999999999
there's no spraying today whatsoever

146.959 --> 151.92000000000002
there's planes up there

149.36 --> 153.36
but yeah yesterday it was all

151.92 --> 155.83999999999997
trailed

153.36 --> 158.64000000000001
into a giant

155.84 --> 160.4
whitish gray soup

158.64 --> 162.95899999999997
like the entire evening was pretty much

160.4 --> 164.72
cloud covered or not really cloud just

162.959 --> 168.72
the haze but now

164.72 --> 172.879
it seems like there is no haze at all

168.72 --> 172.879
and it feels like a really beautiful

173.04 --> 178.0
summer day already

175.28 --> 180.4
maybe not really hot enough to be summer

178.0 --> 184.92
but it's

180.4 --> 184.92000000000002
it's pretty beautiful out there

186.159 --> 193.92
such a clear sky all of a sudden

189.92 --> 193.92
yeah i think it's still blossoming

196.72 --> 200.239
it's really beautiful out there

202.239 --> 205.76
oh oh did my

207.12 --> 211.48000000000002
where did my camera freeze up

212.64 --> 218.35999999999999
yeah my camera's playing up

214.879 --> 218.35999999999999
today again

238.56 --> 241.56
right

250.799 --> 254.799
hello borders boy first to chat good to

270.479 --> 275.03999999999996
hello goldie mckernan good to see you

276.0 --> 281.0
alright so yeah i feel pretty good today

282.8 --> 285.12
yeah

285.44 --> 289.36
like it's almost entirely restored back

287.84 --> 292.08
to normal

289.36 --> 292.08000000000004
and i'm feeling

294.84 --> 299.67999999999995
it i can pretty much just

297.759 --> 301.52000000000004
start

299.68 --> 303.68
moving everything around it and there's

301.52 --> 306.0
nothing that hurts at this point it's

303.68 --> 307.28000000000003
just a little like

306.0 --> 309.12
something's

307.28 --> 311.59999999999997
a little bit in the way but nothing

309.12 --> 315.199
hurts so yeah

311.6 --> 317.6
i'm very certain that by next week

315.199 --> 320.56
like i it will be completely gone i'll

317.6 --> 325.40000000000003
it'll feel like nothing was ever there

320.56 --> 325.4
so yeah very happy about that

326.32 --> 330.56
let's all have a fantastic day indeed

328.639 --> 333.919
goldie mckernan

330.56 --> 333.919
hello seeking star wars

334.72 --> 337.36
you'll be selling tarot card and

336.32 --> 338.4
booklets

337.36 --> 339.84000000000003

338.4 --> 341.59999999999997
20

339.84 --> 344.27
makers market

341.6 --> 347.03900000000004
what there's a 420 market

344.27 --> 350.15999999999997
[Music]

347.039 --> 350.15999999999997
all right cool

351.12 --> 358.24
looks like the swelling is gone

354.08 --> 358.24
well it was gone yesterday right

362.0 --> 364.88
is it

362.96 --> 367.75899999999996
or is it even more gone yeah it's hard

364.88 --> 370.15999999999997
to tell because to me

367.759 --> 372.47900000000004
i like i see less

370.16 --> 374.319
of the swelling and all that rather than

372.479 --> 376.96
that i just felt

374.319 --> 380.639
something being off there right that's

376.96 --> 383.52
like much more in my face

380.639 --> 383.52
pun intended

385.199 --> 390.319
i just feel i felt it more than i could

387.68 --> 390.319
even see it

390.639 --> 393.639
so

394.24 --> 398.40000000000003
yeah but i'm i'm good

396.479 --> 401.84
i've been thinking a lot and i've been

398.4 --> 404.08
thinking a lot about that show i did

401.84 --> 406.79999999999995
two days ago

404.08 --> 409.35999999999996
the whole spring moment like from what

406.8 --> 411.36
it is what that does right all these

409.36 --> 412.47900000000004
things that happening that the easter

411.36 --> 414.40000000000003
challenge

412.479 --> 416.8
because it is

414.4 --> 419.28
i should have i might i don't remember

416.8 --> 421.52000000000004
how much i elaborated on it but it's

419.28 --> 424.08
like the moment where suddenly

421.52 --> 427.84
all these bacteria start to

424.08 --> 427.84
get kicked into active

428.08 --> 431.84
and there's so many memories of all

430.24 --> 433.52
these people

431.84 --> 435.35999999999996
that would hate the springtime because

433.52 --> 438.639
that's typically when they started to

435.36 --> 438.639
get toothaches or

439.44 --> 442.88
like even

440.8 --> 445.199
like some older people

442.88 --> 447.68
like people that would have had like war

445.199 --> 450.56
wounds or something right

447.68 --> 452.319
that those would typically play up

450.56 --> 453.84
during that spring

452.319 --> 455.84000000000003
moment

453.84 --> 458.71999999999997
in that period

455.84 --> 458.71999999999997
around april

460.96 --> 465.84
it's just like and it's really that's

463.44 --> 465.84
there

469.12 --> 472.0
and just like

476.56 --> 479.84
like including

480.0 --> 485.919
the impulsivity and all that

482.8 --> 488.96000000000004
like it's also might be like the most

485.919 --> 490.56
prominent moment where venereal diseases

488.96 --> 493.35999999999996
i guess spread

490.56 --> 495.12
because if you have any of that i don't

493.36 --> 497.599
thank god

495.12 --> 500.16
that's also the moment when those start

497.599 --> 501.28
to kick in right pretty simultaneously

500.16 --> 504.16
to

501.28 --> 508.31899999999996
a lot of people's getting urges

504.16 --> 508.319
to go out and seek somebody to uh

508.56 --> 512.8
to have sex with and all that

511.12 --> 515.919
it's

512.8 --> 519.279
it's just fascinating how that all

515.919 --> 522.8
kind of fits together in that cyclical

519.279 --> 522.8
situation every year

523.839 --> 527.2790000000001
but it is really the moment where

525.839 --> 529.9200000000001
suddenly

527.279 --> 532.08
after winter dormancy

529.92 --> 534.24
a whole bunch of bacteria

532.08 --> 537.36
everywhere just start to like come alive

534.24 --> 540.0
it's their renewal revival renewal and

537.36 --> 542.399
it's not just bad

540.0 --> 544.72
like they they literally do clean up

542.399 --> 544.72
things

547.6 --> 552.48
right

548.48 --> 552.48
anyway just been thinking about it a lot

560.88 --> 564.8
yeah borders boy hello by the way

562.56 --> 567.76
america's silver patriot

564.8 --> 567.76
pgsc net

571.12 --> 574.9590000000001
when the devil tries to corrupt yeah

575.68 --> 579.4399999999999
right all the

577.12 --> 581.839
temptations

579.44 --> 586.6400000000001
addictions

581.839 --> 589.6800000000001
and even like bad character trait habits

586.64 --> 591.519
they also typically start to kick in i

589.68 --> 593.519
actually already explained it like yeah

591.519 --> 595.44
people that are drug addicted

593.519 --> 597.12
it's the time when they they'll probably

595.44 --> 601.12
fall back if

597.12 --> 603.6
or yeah they could resist that

601.12 --> 606.5600000000001
it's just like it's pretty useful to

603.6 --> 608.72
really know that

606.56 --> 611.04
about yourself and the world

608.72 --> 615.279
as spring

611.04 --> 615.279
approaches it's good to know that

615.839 --> 621.36
and potentially anticipate it like

618.56 --> 624.0
realizing like what will my impulses

621.36 --> 625.6800000000001
most likely be what were my impulses

624.0 --> 626.64
last year

625.68 --> 629.4399999999999
right

626.64 --> 632.48
so that you can anticipate it a bit

629.44 --> 633.36
maybe plan out something ahead and of

632.48 --> 635.839
time

633.36 --> 638.8000000000001
to accommodate for it

635.839 --> 641.2
or otherwise just mentally prepared just

638.8 --> 643.3599999999999
to brace yourself if you if you don't if

641.2 --> 646.6800000000001
you don't have that opportunity anyway

643.36 --> 646.6800000000001
hello elise

648.16 --> 652.399
it's been a

649.519 --> 655.88
bit good live show due to

652.399 --> 655.88
work right

665.04 --> 670.079
that's okay

667.2 --> 672.1600000000001
yeah yesterday's show was meh

670.079 --> 674.0
for some reason yesterday i was just

672.16 --> 677.36
like completely

674.0 --> 679.44
bogged down by sloth

677.36 --> 683.279
it might be also just part of the

679.44 --> 683.2790000000001
regeneration cycle and all that

685.36 --> 692.0790000000001
but i feel much less sloth

688.56 --> 692.079
right now i'm very happy about it

692.24 --> 697.839
because yesterday i was just slow and

694.16 --> 700.64
like dude on the debates i was terrible

697.839 --> 702.6400000000001
annoying not annoyingly terrible but

700.64 --> 704.48
just like

702.64 --> 708.0
there was this whole

704.48 --> 710.16
guessing game going on like of quotes

708.0 --> 711.519
like anti-flat earther quotes and all

710.16 --> 714.0
that

711.519 --> 715.44
and like i recognized a lot of the

714.0 --> 717.92
quotes

715.44 --> 721.7600000000001
but every time i tried to guess the

717.92 --> 723.92
names like every single time i tried i

721.76 --> 726.959
got the name wrong every single time

723.92 --> 730.24
it's like what the hell is wrong with me

726.959 --> 733.1199999999999
why couldn't i focus

730.24 --> 733.12
that's just all like

735.36 --> 739.76
couldn't focus

737.2 --> 739.76
annoying

739.92 --> 745.4399999999999
right but i'm certainly gonna try to get

742.959 --> 747.92
more focus today also yeah i did go out

745.44 --> 750.32
before the show

747.92 --> 751.68
and i think that like in going out in

750.32 --> 753.7600000000001
the morning

751.68 --> 755.68
having a bit of physical movement does

753.76 --> 758.68
really help because i didn't have that

755.68 --> 758.68
yesterday

759.36 --> 763.36
bring can bring your a game every day i

762.24 --> 766.0
guess

763.36 --> 767.6800000000001
well thank you for making an excuse up

766.0 --> 769.839
for me

767.68 --> 769.8389999999999
but

770.16 --> 773.8389999999999
like

771.519 --> 776.24
yesterday wasn't like even a b game it

773.839 --> 779.36
was just like c

776.24 --> 781.36
or worse c minus

779.36 --> 783.36
i was just slow

781.36 --> 784.839
and yeah i can still come up with things

783.36 --> 786.399
but they just like

784.839 --> 788.5600000000001
quickly

786.399 --> 790.88
like the the momentum builds up but then

788.56 --> 793.1999999999999
it it just step stalls

790.88 --> 796.88
so i don't really keep climbing that

793.2 --> 799.279
much i don't have as much

796.88 --> 801.92
moments of super clear oversight where i

799.279 --> 804.959
can explain a whole bunch of fractal

801.92 --> 807.12
inside details

804.959 --> 810.1199999999999
i think i'd i do much much better right

807.12 --> 810.12
now

814.639 --> 818.72
oh man on the edge do you think nathan

816.72 --> 823.76
might consider adding any scientific

818.72 --> 823.76
evidence of infinity or space time

823.839 --> 827.6800000000001
war page

825.12 --> 829.92
what is space-time war

827.68 --> 832.399
to the housekeeping questions no i don't

829.92 --> 832.399
think so

833.36 --> 841.1990000000001
like the thing is infinity is not

838.24 --> 844.9590000000001
infinity is a concept you can never like

841.199 --> 845.92
that's immediately illogical because

844.959 --> 848.0
like

845.92 --> 850.8
yeah can you find

848.0 --> 853.92
scientific evidence of a shoe right of

850.8 --> 855.68
course not because it's not a phenomenon

853.92 --> 857.5999999999999
you can't like that doesn't it's not

855.68 --> 859.04
doesn't make any sense and neither is

857.6 --> 861.36
infinity

859.04 --> 862.7199999999999
like how do you even very manipulate the

861.36 --> 865.279
infinity

862.72 --> 865.279
yeah so

866.88 --> 869.88
now

882.48 --> 887.6800000000001
i feel like i got a participation trophy

885.92 --> 888.7199999999999
just for listening

887.68 --> 891.68
what

888.72 --> 895.399
listening to what elise g

891.68 --> 895.399
what are you talking about

904.88 --> 909.04
right anyway

906.399 --> 910.839
yeah yesterday

909.04 --> 913.8389999999999
brenda got

910.839 --> 917.0400000000001
back on with jim bob

913.839 --> 917.0400000000001
and it was hilarious

917.92 --> 924.3199999999999
it was just it was sillier or worse than

921.6 --> 924.32
the last time

924.8 --> 929.8389999999999
and jim bob made a brilliant little clip

927.04 --> 932.24
about it that he uploaded that you you

929.839 --> 935.0400000000001
gotta watch that

932.24 --> 935.04
you really do

938.88 --> 942.399
i was there live

941.199 --> 943.92
but it's just

942.399 --> 947.279
like

943.92 --> 949.92
jim bob really framed it so well he's so

947.279 --> 949.92
good at that

950.48 --> 955.36
check it out

952.8 --> 957.8389999999999
it's a very short little video 55

955.36 --> 957.839
seconds

965.6 --> 968.6
ah

968.72 --> 972.88
the molten iron core can't be

970.48 --> 974.8000000000001
manipulated but nathan has it as a

972.88 --> 979.199
housekeeping question

974.8 --> 979.199
yeah but that involves the direct

979.48 --> 984.9590000000001
architectural claim of within the globe

983.04 --> 985.92
cosmology

984.959 --> 988.2399999999999
right

985.92 --> 991.12
infinity is not a part of the globe

988.24 --> 991.12
cosmology

992.16 --> 999.279
right infinity is just

994.079 --> 999.279
it's just a pure mathematical concept

1005.36 --> 1010.5600000000001
right what even it like is there an

1007.759 --> 1014.0
infinity claim anywhere

1010.56 --> 1014.0
within the cosmology

1014.079 --> 1019.519
like i don't even think that there's a

1016.88 --> 1024.36
very distinct claim for example about

1019.519 --> 1024.36
infinite amount of space right

1025.679 --> 1028.959
i mean if there prominently would have

1028.079 --> 1031.36
been

1028.959 --> 1034.4
like yes of course it's infinite and

1031.36 --> 1035.839
that's just the accepted norm right then

1034.4 --> 1038.3190000000002
it might make a good housekeeping

1035.839 --> 1040.559
question but there is no such claim you

1038.319 --> 1040.559
see

1041.919 --> 1047.919
so just infinity as a generalized

1044.959 --> 1050.0
conception is not really a

1047.919 --> 1053.2
good housekeeping question for flat

1050.0 --> 1055.2
earth debate

1053.2 --> 1059.1200000000001
but it's good to ponder upon these

1055.2 --> 1059.1200000000001
things though so i applaud that

1065.12 --> 1069.52
oh the guessing game right lsg

1067.52 --> 1071.039
participation trophy for listening to

1069.52 --> 1073.28
that

1071.039 --> 1073.28
right

1075.039 --> 1077.76
well the thing is

1079.36 --> 1084.799
if i would have been in like a whole

1081.2 --> 1086.64
nother energy track trail railroad track

1084.799 --> 1088.799
for myself then i probably would have

1086.64 --> 1091.76
been very good at it

1088.799 --> 1091.76
but i just wasn't

1093.12 --> 1097.9189999999999
and yeah maybe it's also because fed

1096.08 --> 1100.8799999999999
these days is just

1097.919 --> 1102.96
they're all so freaking focused on this

1100.88 --> 1104.88
math [ __ ]

1102.96 --> 1105.6000000000001
right

1104.88 --> 1107.919
and

1105.6 --> 1110.6399999999999
yeah sure it's worth it right i applaud

1107.919 --> 1113.1200000000001
that it's just that

1110.64 --> 1117.1200000000001
there's not a lot for me to really latch

1113.12 --> 1119.6789999999999
on to there and do anything with

1117.12 --> 1121.6
so yeah i have to admit i'm a bit bored

1119.679 --> 1123.6000000000001
but it's because of the math

1121.6 --> 1126.0
and i know there's people out there that

1123.6 --> 1129.36
are like really exhilarated that there

1126.0 --> 1135.24
is more math in it instead

1129.36 --> 1135.24
right it's just not really my thing

1146.799 --> 1151.84
all right it's more my thing to to just

1149.6 --> 1151.84
like

1154.96 --> 1160.0
think about yeah just

1158.08 --> 1162.24
more substantial

1160.0 --> 1164.4
potentials and all that like what could

1162.24 --> 1166.4
be

1164.4 --> 1167.52
i had a good moment about that yesterday

1166.4 --> 1170.72
though

1167.52 --> 1170.72
in the end show

1171.28 --> 1175.44
right

1173.039 --> 1177.84
like the different realm

1175.44 --> 1179.8400000000001
segments like how many could there be

1177.84 --> 1182.8799999999999
where they did they used to be

1179.84 --> 1185.76
interconnected once makes sense if if

1182.88 --> 1187.6000000000001
like the creatures were a lot faster a

1185.76 --> 1190.4
lot bigger

1187.6 --> 1192.08
like maybe originally

1190.4 --> 1195.3600000000001
eden

1192.08 --> 1197.12
was the united realm segments

1195.36 --> 1200.0
all together

1197.12 --> 1202.6399999999999
and like the what we know over here is

1200.0 --> 1204.64
basically just a bunch of very little

1202.64 --> 1206.64
islands

1204.64 --> 1210.0
compared to what is

1206.64 --> 1211.76
else is out there in the realm segments

1210.0 --> 1214.48
and that they at some point then

1211.76 --> 1214.48
separate it

1215.919 --> 1219.88
they'll just split apart

1222.799 --> 1226.32
and we all ended up with our own little

1224.88 --> 1229.2
world

1226.32 --> 1229.2
realm segment

1231.039 --> 1234.799
right those are the types of things that

1233.039 --> 1238.76
i think about

1234.799 --> 1238.76
that that is my thing

1253.28 --> 1258.8799999999999
globers claim their sphere is no but

1256.88 --> 1262.679
yeah but that's technically not true

1258.88 --> 1262.679
though man on the edge

1264.88 --> 1268.3200000000002
i mean

1266.159 --> 1268.3200000000002
i

1269.679 --> 1278.52
i mean like the the size of the universe

1275.679 --> 1282.72
is basically even within the paradigm of

1278.52 --> 1282.72
heliocentrism still up for debate

1283.679 --> 1287.919
like and how are you gonna settle it

1285.679 --> 1290.24
right

1287.919 --> 1293.679
you're gonna have to have like the math

1290.24 --> 1296.4
ready for that somehow and infinity just

1293.679 --> 1299.3600000000001
like infinity actualized

1296.4 --> 1302.64
and not as an in-between thing that

1299.36 --> 1306.1589999999999
happens that must be resolved then

1302.64 --> 1308.5590000000002
like infinity is not tenable it's

1306.159 --> 1311.7600000000002
realistically it's not tenable

1308.559 --> 1313.76
it's only tenable within conception

1311.76 --> 1316.32
so

1313.76 --> 1319.12
but yeah if that means that there is a

1316.32 --> 1321.9189999999999
finite amount then how do you freaking

1319.12 --> 1325.76
establish that finity

1321.919 --> 1328.4
right this finite nature

1325.76 --> 1331.2
and so this is like endlessly debatable

1328.4 --> 1333.3600000000001
it's it's just like copernicus

1331.2 --> 1335.8400000000001
distance to the sun like yeah it could

1333.36 --> 1337.36
just like oh more more more oh more oh

1335.84 --> 1338.799
it's much more and then maybe oh wait

1337.36 --> 1341.28
it's much less oh wait no it's more

1338.799 --> 1344.559
again more more it's it becomes

1341.28 --> 1344.559
completely arbitrary

1344.84 --> 1351.039
right endlessly

1348.4 --> 1351.039
debatable

1355.679 --> 1362.0800000000002
now of course globers here

1358.4 --> 1364.96
on the ground the believers

1362.08 --> 1368.0
they might just say like that's infinite

1364.96 --> 1369.6000000000001
for several reasons because they think

1368.0 --> 1370.88
like oh it could be infinite because

1369.6 --> 1374.32
they don't understand the whole

1370.88 --> 1376.24
ontological situation with that

1374.32 --> 1379.039
or

1376.24 --> 1381.44
because they just think like yeah

1379.039 --> 1383.36
basically infinite because it's so

1381.44 --> 1385.039
astronomically large

1383.36 --> 1387.36
like i i can't

1385.039 --> 1391.039
get my mind around that so i'm just

1387.36 --> 1391.039
gonna call it infinite right

1394.559 --> 1400.559
but yeah if we want to make

1397.039 --> 1402.72
real solid arguments from the flatter

1400.559 --> 1404.72
side against

1402.72 --> 1408.48
the globe cosmology we're going to have

1404.72 --> 1411.3600000000001
to kind of stick to the official

1408.48 --> 1414.799
narratives in that

1411.36 --> 1416.799
the official conventions i should say

1414.799 --> 1418.4
narratives are problematic because yeah

1416.799 --> 1420.72
people are making up their own narrative

1418.4 --> 1423.2
that's how we got to anti-flat earther

1420.72 --> 1423.2
narrative

1427.6 --> 1430.9189999999999
hey crockett

1432.88 --> 1436.7990000000002
anyway did you guys take a look at the

1435.2 --> 1437.52
the link

1436.799 --> 1441.24
from

1437.52 --> 1441.24
jim bob with brenda

1444.72 --> 1447.76
hey jeff gassed

1451.36 --> 1454.36
hmm

1462.88 --> 1468.88
ah man gradually

1466.559 --> 1471.2
like the muscle stiffness is also like

1468.88 --> 1474.96
gradually going away which i really

1471.2 --> 1478.0800000000002
welcome because i have been like

1474.96 --> 1480.96
like this tighten up

1478.08 --> 1483.52
figure for a while it's really annoying

1480.96 --> 1483.52
to be all

1483.76 --> 1486.76
rigid

1487.679 --> 1492.64
all right man of the on the edge

1490.48 --> 1497.64
glad you understand and you're welcome

1492.64 --> 1497.64
for the explanation it's what i do

1505.36 --> 1513.0
so anymore

1507.76 --> 1513.0
i like i am doing really good right now

1514.08 --> 1517.9189999999999
and like maybe it's the clear sky

1518.72 --> 1524.08
and maybe that in combination with like

1521.12 --> 1526.2399999999998
me being like in like the second half of

1524.08 --> 1528.799
even the healing phase so i'm just like

1526.24 --> 1531.6
yeah yeah yeah

1528.799 --> 1535.32
i got focus

1531.6 --> 1535.32
and i got a bit of stamina

1545.12 --> 1549.8799999999999
oh and i also got a croissant

1552.9 --> 1556.0990000000002
[Music]

1557.279 --> 1562.25
now all i need is for the chat to get

1560.24 --> 1565.039
going

1562.25 --> 1567.36
[Music]

1565.039 --> 1571.84
so i can actually

1567.36 --> 1571.84
apply this energy to something

1589.679 --> 1595.3600000000001
this would have been a good time for

1591.039 --> 1599.84
steamy traveler to pop by but uh

1595.36 --> 1599.84
steamy traveler is done with me

1610.48 --> 1615.6
okay man on the edge when you hear

1612.799 --> 1617.36
people say planet or global

1615.6 --> 1619.4399999999998
in passing conversation do you feel

1617.36 --> 1620.799
tempted to tell them that planets are

1619.44 --> 1624.72
nonsense

1620.799 --> 1626.96
no no i don't i used to though

1624.72 --> 1629.039
right it's one of the hazards of like

1626.96 --> 1632.32
first really figuring out flat earth you

1629.039 --> 1632.32
get the sleepless nights

1632.4 --> 1636.0
then it's like really pressing then

1634.159 --> 1638.64
after those sleepless nights kind of

1636.0 --> 1640.64
stop and you settle a bit

1638.64 --> 1642.159
then you're gonna have that impulse a

1640.64 --> 1644.72
lot right

1642.159 --> 1646.0
but like without the pressing effect on

1644.72 --> 1647.84
it

1646.0 --> 1649.6
well i've been doing this now for what

1647.84 --> 1652.6399999999999
is it six years

1649.6 --> 1654.9599999999998
like i don't care anymore right because

1652.64 --> 1659.039
global or planet

1654.96 --> 1661.039
to me is just one little little dot

1659.039 --> 1663.279
within like the narratives that come

1661.039 --> 1665.44
through people that is problematic and

1663.279 --> 1668.0
it's usually the least problematic you

1665.44 --> 1670.3200000000002
know what really does trigger me people

1668.0 --> 1673.36
completely not getting what the hell is

1670.32 --> 1675.6
going on with everything

1673.36 --> 1677.84
like they don't understand anything

1675.6 --> 1682.559
that's more problematic to me not

1677.84 --> 1685.84
whether they say planet or global

1682.559 --> 1688.08
my problem is there the universal lack

1685.84 --> 1690.1589999999999
of understanding about like entire

1688.08 --> 1692.6399999999999
fields like people that just don't get

1690.159 --> 1695.679
anything medical that don't get anything

1692.64 --> 1697.76
about food and taking care of yourself

1695.679 --> 1701.3600000000001
using that

1697.76 --> 1701.36
that's more triggering to me

1702.72 --> 1706.159
than whether they say global or planet

1705.2 --> 1708.799
right

1706.159 --> 1711.0390000000002
now if they were like really great and

1708.799 --> 1713.679
they knew so much and then they started

1711.039 --> 1715.12
to say global or planet in between that

1713.679 --> 1717.76
yeah then it would stand out to me

1715.12 --> 1720.4799999999998
because then it's suddenly like

1717.76 --> 1723.12
like an annoying crack or a chip in an

1720.48 --> 1726.32
otherwise perfect or seemingly perfect

1723.12 --> 1728.32
gem and then it gets annoying

1726.32 --> 1730.48
i had this issue for example with my

1728.32 --> 1732.559
healer a bit yeah

1730.48 --> 1734.88
because my healer is not

1732.559 --> 1736.1589999999999
really a flat earther

1734.88 --> 1736.96
he's never

1736.159 --> 1738.48
dug

1736.96 --> 1741.039
really into that

1738.48 --> 1742.96
thing he's talked purely to the esoteric

1741.039 --> 1744.559
and the spiritual

1742.96 --> 1746.48
because he's really good at that right

1744.559 --> 1749.36
so i don't want to disturb him with it

1746.48 --> 1751.3600000000001
but i did confront him a bit

1749.36 --> 1754.8799999999999
and he does

1751.36 --> 1756.6399999999999
it seems like he he has adapted a bit in

1754.88 --> 1759.7600000000002
the sense that

1756.64 --> 1764.44
he's he's watching the details of his

1759.76 --> 1764.44
word use concerning that better

1768.32 --> 1771.12
and yeah

1779.2 --> 1784.64
so yeah it's only

1780.88 --> 1788.0800000000002
it's yeah people really believing the

1784.64 --> 1791.5200000000002
planet or going to the stars or anything

1788.08 --> 1793.76
like yeah if people know very little

1791.52 --> 1795.36
then yeah that's just another thing in

1793.76 --> 1798.48
between there

1795.36 --> 1800.6399999999999
like i yeah it's already like a giant

1798.48 --> 1802.96
case that needs to be resolved and oh

1800.64 --> 1805.3600000000001
it's just one little deta another detail

1802.96 --> 1807.8400000000001
in them in between all that right

1805.36 --> 1810.8799999999999
just one extra problem it's not doesn't

1807.84 --> 1813.4399999999998
even stand out if you have no grip on

1810.88 --> 1816.5590000000002
the world concerning everything else

1813.44 --> 1818.559
but if somebody really knows everything

1816.559 --> 1820.72
really well like they're really up to

1818.559 --> 1823.6789999999999
date with medical

1820.72 --> 1825.52
things not just mainstream

1823.679 --> 1827.6000000000001
but like they know things about

1825.52 --> 1830.0
alternative they already know mistakes

1827.6 --> 1831.84
that sort of thing like really impresses

1830.0 --> 1833.52
me especially if ladies know that sort

1831.84 --> 1836.48
of thing

1833.52 --> 1838.24
really impresses me and if they were

1836.48 --> 1840.559
like that and i'd be like you're awesome

1838.24 --> 1842.96
you know so much and then they turn out

1840.559 --> 1845.36
to be like a glober

1842.96 --> 1847.1200000000001
yeah then it would annoy me then it

1845.36 --> 1848.7199999999998
would kind of start to

1847.12 --> 1851.84
poke me

1848.72 --> 1851.84
in the face

1852.159 --> 1856.64
but if people like don't know anything

1854.88 --> 1858.96
then it doesn't really matter whether

1856.64 --> 1861.1200000000001
they believe in the globe or not to me

1858.96 --> 1865.44
because it's just one little problem in

1861.12 --> 1869.6789999999999
between a giant pile of issues see

1865.44 --> 1869.679
that's how i i how i approach it

1874.32 --> 1880.6399999999999
i mean let's just say for example

1876.48 --> 1883.76
somebody's like super afraid of viruses

1880.64 --> 1885.6000000000001
right and all that bacteria

1883.76 --> 1887.519
and they even believe covet and they

1885.6 --> 1889.279
talk about oh i heard that it could do

1887.519 --> 1891.36
this and that

1889.279 --> 1893.279
like why would i give a [ __ ] whether

1891.36 --> 1895.039
they believe in the globe or not right

1893.279 --> 1897.76
at that point

1895.039 --> 1900.24
i mean there's a much more pressing and

1897.76 --> 1903.919
severe problem right there that should

1900.24 --> 1903.919
probably be tackled first

1904.399 --> 1907.559
you know

1910.24 --> 1915.2
and then if you manage to connect up

1912.64 --> 1918.24
with some somebody like that

1915.2 --> 1920.799
and they actually do show that there is

1918.24 --> 1922.799
room for them to learn about it and

1920.799 --> 1924.559
maybe overcome it

1922.799 --> 1927.039
well then maybe

1924.559 --> 1929.2
if you go there and basically yeah

1927.039 --> 1932.72
through bonding and just conversations

1929.2 --> 1935.2
and all that resolve that for them

1932.72 --> 1937.76
then maybe after that

1935.2 --> 1940.3990000000001
the globe is like a next good step right

1937.76 --> 1943.12
because once somebody really gets going

1940.399 --> 1946.7199999999998
in in an awakening process and

1943.12 --> 1946.7199999999998
like as they transition

1946.96 --> 1951.1200000000001
if that's really working out for them

1949.12 --> 1953.84
it's usually

1951.12 --> 1955.6
you can use that momentum right they

1953.84 --> 1957.6789999999999
because they are starting climbing and

1955.6 --> 1959.6
it's like okay well if they're already

1957.679 --> 1962.3200000000002
starting climbing metaphorically if it's

1959.6 --> 1964.32
starting climbing that ladder

1962.32 --> 1965.84
they're already on the go

1964.32 --> 1966.799
they might just

1965.84 --> 1968.799
be

1966.799 --> 1970.6299999999999
more easily tempted to just climb a

1968.799 --> 1971.76
little further than as well

1970.63 --> 1972.5590000000002
[Music]

1971.76 --> 1975.36
right

1972.559 --> 1978.399
just don't pile it all on all at once

1975.36 --> 1978.399
because then it's too much

1981.84 --> 1985.6
anyway i hope that helps

1985.76 --> 1989.12
hey good servant by the way good to see

1987.6 --> 1992.6399999999999
you

1989.12 --> 1996.08
what do i think about snake venom

1992.64 --> 1998.24
i think there's something to snake venom

1996.08 --> 1999.6789999999999
as an involvement

1998.24 --> 2004.039
with

1999.679 --> 2004.039
the medical industry in general

2006.08 --> 2011.4399999999998
i think snake phantom is actually being

2008.559 --> 2014.48
used pharmaceutically

2011.44 --> 2017.2
modified or whatever they do with that

2014.48 --> 2020.08
so snake venom is involved in in

2017.2 --> 2020.0800000000002
pharmaceuticals

2020.32 --> 2023.12
in medicine

2024.159 --> 2028.3990000000001
like the the real

2025.84 --> 2030.48
the high techy one and all that right

2028.399 --> 2032.9599999999998
also i think that

2030.48 --> 2034.64
there might just be

2032.96 --> 2037.44
a snake phantom component in the

2034.64 --> 2042.0
vaccines just like right there

2037.44 --> 2043.44
modified or unmodified something

2042.0 --> 2046.72
yeah

2043.44 --> 2050.32
i i would not be surprised as i said

2046.72 --> 2052.079
like a long time ago by now

2050.32 --> 2053.76
is it a year

2052.079 --> 2057.04
two years ago

2053.76 --> 2059.5200000000004
like there is so much in these vaccines

2057.04 --> 2061.839
it's never gonna end like

2059.52 --> 2063.839
you could talk about that for a long

2061.839 --> 2066.0
time like all the [ __ ] that they're

2063.839 --> 2067.839
gonna discover that's actually in there

2066.0 --> 2070.079
because it's like

2067.839 --> 2071.04
everything they threw everything in

2070.079 --> 2074.159
there

2071.04 --> 2077.839
so snake venom being in there i would

2074.159 --> 2080.159
not surprise me one little bit

2077.839 --> 2082.159
right if they like put they'd like take

2080.159 --> 2084.399
a vaccine

2082.159 --> 2086.879
and they just like spectro analyze it

2084.399 --> 2089.2
specifically on different types of snake

2086.879 --> 2091.2799999999997
venom i would not be surprised if they

2089.2 --> 2093.2799999999997
find spikes

2091.28 --> 2097.28
that it's actually in there it would not

2093.28 --> 2097.28
surprise me one bit however

2097.359 --> 2103.0
the idea of like putting it in the water

2100.4 --> 2106.079
so that everybody gets it

2103.0 --> 2108.079
absolute harsh [ __ ]

2106.079 --> 2110.1600000000003
[ __ ]

2108.079 --> 2113.28
one of the dumbest

2110.16 --> 2116.64
conspiracy [ __ ] stories i've ever

2113.28 --> 2118.32
heard everybody that repeated that snake

2116.64 --> 2120.0789999999997
phantom in the water

2118.32 --> 2123.3590000000004
is a complete

2120.079 --> 2125.44
[ __ ] unconditional [ __ ]

2123.359 --> 2128.96
every single individual

2125.44 --> 2132.48
they literally prove that they have no

2128.96 --> 2134.8
critical thinking grip on reality

2132.48 --> 2137.76
the only reason to ever latch on to that

2134.8 --> 2139.04
is by really kind of dumb

2137.76 --> 2141.6800000000003
hype

2139.04 --> 2143.7599999999998
sensitivity and that's it

2141.68 --> 2146.3199999999997
that's the that's the pulse that's

2143.76 --> 2149.8390000000004
driven people to latch on to that

2146.32 --> 2152.48
because it's absolute nonsense

2149.839 --> 2153.839
like no there's absolutely no snake

2152.48 --> 2156.88
venom

2153.839 --> 2159.68
outside of potentially it being in these

2156.88 --> 2160.56
in in the in the supposed covet vaccines

2159.68 --> 2163.2799999999997
right

2160.56 --> 2165.52
that's the place you might find it in

2163.28 --> 2166.7200000000003
it is interesting it's worth looking

2165.52 --> 2169.44
into

2166.72 --> 2171.7599999999998
but the idea is in the water or they

2169.44 --> 2173.04
sprayed it

2171.76 --> 2175.28
horseshit

2173.04 --> 2178.0
absolute 100

2175.28 --> 2178.0
horseshit

2179.119 --> 2184.839
i mean you'll you'll be sooner to find

2181.68 --> 2186.96
snake venom remnants literally in

2184.839 --> 2188.4
horseshit than like in the drinking

2186.96 --> 2190.079
water or something

2188.4 --> 2193.599
literally

2190.079 --> 2195.76
right because yeah that's what they do

2193.599 --> 2197.52
they inject the horses with snake venom

2195.76 --> 2200.0
and then they produce like the

2197.52 --> 2201.839
antibodies

2200.0 --> 2204.32
and then yeah

2201.839 --> 2206.48
some horse phantom or some snake phantom

2204.32 --> 2208.4
components might actually end up in the

2206.48 --> 2209.52
horseshit i don't know how it works

2208.4 --> 2211.839
exactly

2209.52 --> 2215.839
right so there's more chance to find

2211.839 --> 2219.119
snake venom in horseshit literally

2215.839 --> 2219.119
than in the drinking water

2226.96 --> 2231.04
hey julio pabin good to see you

2232.4 --> 2235.2000000000003
flatter sage

2241.52 --> 2247.839
do you have any debates against globers

2244.8 --> 2250.96
posted on youtube

2247.839 --> 2254.0789999999997
well man on the edge i got some

2250.96 --> 2257.52
early bird shows like in the first what

2254.079 --> 2260.079
is it 200 300 episodes

2257.52 --> 2263.839
where i did have people on the show and

2260.079 --> 2263.8390000000004
including one of those being brenda

2264.32 --> 2270.7200000000003
right but it's like an early

2266.88 --> 2272.6400000000003
format of early bird i

2270.72 --> 2274.48
it was probably very different i was

2272.64 --> 2276.4
probably a lot more nervous on average

2274.48 --> 2279.2
about it

2276.4 --> 2281.52
i don't know how well they hold up my my

2279.2 --> 2283.68
early bird shows at the beginning i

2281.52 --> 2287.359
should probably just

2283.68 --> 2289.9199999999996
take a moment and just watch one of them

2287.359 --> 2292.4
see how they were like compared to how i

2289.92 --> 2294.56
do my shows now

2292.4 --> 2297.839
i just remember that back then also i

2294.56 --> 2301.04
had ups and downs it just had less

2297.839 --> 2304.4
control over that

2301.04 --> 2307.7599999999998
so the ups and downs were more prominent

2304.4 --> 2310.2400000000002
more visible noticeable

2307.76 --> 2313.8390000000004
and less averaged out

2310.24 --> 2313.839
is that what i try to do now

2317.28 --> 2321.2000000000003
yeah george sanford i know

2319.359 --> 2322.96
hello

2321.2 --> 2324.72
there's still chemicals in the water

2322.96 --> 2328.7200000000003
it's just snake phantom is not one of

2324.72 --> 2330.48
them right like put chlorine

2328.72 --> 2332.16
in the water

2330.48 --> 2335.359
or fluoride

2332.16 --> 2337.5989999999997
where that yeah in america that happens

2335.359 --> 2340.48
some places

2337.599 --> 2343.6800000000003
which is very terrible by the way

2340.48 --> 2345.28
it's also destructive for like nature

2343.68 --> 2347.44
to do that

2345.28 --> 2349.76
right so yeah there is that problem i've

2347.44 --> 2353.839
had a water filter for

2349.76 --> 2354.88
over 10 15 years

2353.839 --> 2358.0
and

2354.88 --> 2360.079
but yeah it's just because

2358.0 --> 2361.68
what if right you go somewhere you don't

2360.079 --> 2363.8390000000004
know what kind of water is there if you

2361.68 --> 2367.64
have those water filters you always have

2363.839 --> 2367.64
like really good water

2370.4 --> 2376.1600000000003
but yeah i'm not afraid of snake venom

2372.56 --> 2376.16
in the water it's just [ __ ]

2377.28 --> 2380.8390000000004
and also like it wouldn't work

2379.68 --> 2385.2
you see

2380.839 --> 2388.0
venom has to be injected

2385.2 --> 2390.8799999999997
if you eat venom

2388.0 --> 2391.599
then the acids in your stomach are going

2390.88 --> 2393.2000000000003
to

2391.599 --> 2396.2400000000002
destroy it

2393.2 --> 2398.24
it's not going to be poisonous right so

2396.24 --> 2400.7999999999997
unless you got like an ulcer or

2398.24 --> 2402.8799999999997
something like basically

2400.8 --> 2406.1600000000003
a bit of a wound in your stomach yeah if

2402.88 --> 2408.0
you drink poison that like snap snake

2406.16 --> 2410.56
and nut poison snake venom it's the

2408.0 --> 2413.599
venom part you see the venom is what

2410.56 --> 2417.839
makes is it what signifies that it has

2413.599 --> 2421.28
to basically penetrate the blood barrier

2417.839 --> 2422.16
is it poison then ingestion will still

2421.28 --> 2425.0400000000004
make

2422.16 --> 2426.7999999999997
keep the toxicity effect

2425.04 --> 2430.48
venom

2426.8 --> 2432.4
signifies that the stomach acid destroys

2430.48 --> 2435.04
the toxicity

2432.4 --> 2438.2400000000002
so that's why it's called venom right

2435.04 --> 2440.48
so yeah oh what are you gonna do drink

2438.24 --> 2442.9599999999996
water with venom it literally wouldn't

2440.48 --> 2445.04
do anything yeah that's why it's so

2442.96 --> 2447.28
[ __ ]

2445.04 --> 2449.44
so stupid

2447.28 --> 2449.44
no

2450.079 --> 2453.44
but yeah

2451.52 --> 2456.4
put it in a vaccine or something yeah

2453.44 --> 2460.079
that's exactly

2456.4 --> 2460.079
how it would still work then

2463.28 --> 2469.76
can you build up snake venom tolerance

2466.8 --> 2469.76
i don't think so

2472.319 --> 2475.2
maybe a little

2477.28 --> 2480.28
i

2480.4 --> 2485.2000000000003
i know you can build up tolerance with

2482.4 --> 2487.52
things like uh

2485.2 --> 2491.9199999999996
cyanide

2487.52 --> 2491.92
i don't know if the same works for venom

2492.0 --> 2499.2
also it might be different right

2496.72 --> 2501.4399999999996
like maybe

2499.2 --> 2502.7999999999997
it could be that even like

2501.44 --> 2505.28
having venom

2502.8 --> 2507.52
poisoning from one snake

2505.28 --> 2509.2000000000003
and you're surviving that and just like

2507.52 --> 2511.44
okay that's fine

2509.2 --> 2514.48
maybe that could even like make you more

2511.44 --> 2516.2400000000002
sensitive or like almost allergic to

2514.48 --> 2517.76
other types of venom i don't know

2516.24 --> 2519.7599999999998
exactly how that worked you would have

2517.76 --> 2524.079
to ask like a snake

2519.76 --> 2524.079
venom expert such questions

2524.319 --> 2529.2799999999997
i bet there is research on it i just

2527.119 --> 2531.6800000000003
don't know those types of details never

2529.28 --> 2532.5600000000004
bumped into it that it really stuck to

2531.68 --> 2534.16
mine

2532.56 --> 2535.68
if i bumped into something like that i

2534.16 --> 2538.96
would remember because that would be

2535.68 --> 2538.96
really interesting to know

2541.28 --> 2544.88
tolerance be venom right

2545.68 --> 2552.64
snake handlers might build up tolerance

2549.839 --> 2552.64
admit okay

2552.88 --> 2558.6800000000003
but i think that that still depends on

2554.88 --> 2558.6800000000003
the type of snake though

2570.56 --> 2573.2
but yeah

2573.599 --> 2579.2000000000003
maybe they do build up tolerance

2576.24 --> 2581.359
sure

2579.2 --> 2584.68
hello jess palmer by the way and seek

2581.359 --> 2584.68
star wars

2596.079 --> 2600.319
right so i bet that

2598.72 --> 2603.1189999999997
for the less

2600.319 --> 2605.119
lethal type of poisonous snakes

2603.119 --> 2608.4
it would only make sense that you could

2605.119 --> 2610.2400000000002
definitely build up tolerance for that

2608.4 --> 2611.92
some people even to a degree where

2610.24 --> 2613.7599999999998
literally getting bitten by those types

2611.92 --> 2617.359
of snake wouldn't do anything

2613.76 --> 2617.3590000000004
right it'd be like yeah

2617.68 --> 2621.44
just like

2618.8 --> 2622.4
drink a little extra of this

2621.44 --> 2624.7200000000003
and

2622.4 --> 2626.7200000000003
like it'll all be gone in the morning i

2624.72 --> 2628.16
might have a bit of a sore muscle right

2626.72 --> 2630.319
yeah sure

2628.16 --> 2633.7599999999998
but like for the really

2630.319 --> 2636.16
seriously poisonous snakes

2633.76 --> 2638.2400000000002
is it like

2636.16 --> 2641.2799999999997
king cobras and like some of those

2638.24 --> 2643.4399999999996
really freaky river snakes

2641.28 --> 2645.44
yeah i don't know if you can build up

2643.44 --> 2646.839
tolerance to that because those are like

2645.44 --> 2651.119
really

2646.839 --> 2651.119
dangerous the poison of that

2652.64 --> 2656.1189999999997
so i heard

2672.48 --> 2676.92
right letter sage yeah yeah

2675.359 --> 2679.7599999999998
right whether it's like blood

2676.92 --> 2683.64
collagulating poison or just like

2679.76 --> 2683.6400000000003
neurotoxin indeed

2700.8 --> 2704.2000000000003
lead poisoning

2706.64 --> 2711.52
well yeah lead poisoning isn't super

2709.52 --> 2713.119
serious

2711.52 --> 2715.839
like it's not

2713.119 --> 2717.52
like plutonium it's like like super

2715.839 --> 2721.359
poisonous or something

2717.52 --> 2723.28
it's just unhealthy and like

2721.359 --> 2726.14
the more you get of it the more it'll

2723.28 --> 2728.8
start to burden like your system

2726.14 --> 2731.04
[Music]

2728.8 --> 2731.04
right

2731.2 --> 2735.04
so if you're constantly working with

2733.2 --> 2738.0
lead

2735.04 --> 2739.359
yeah you will definitely get like lead

2738.0 --> 2741.119
poisoning

2739.359 --> 2746.2799999999997
symptoms

2741.119 --> 2746.28
but it doesn't like kill you right away

2746.56 --> 2752.72
you can still get rid of it

2749.52 --> 2755.04
but i imagine that if you combine lead

2752.72 --> 2757.04
poisoning like with other conditions

2755.04 --> 2758.96
then it could be pretty bad

2757.04 --> 2762.96
pretty much like most

2758.96 --> 2765.68
toxic load burdens right if if it

2762.96 --> 2767.76
compounds with other situations yeah it

2765.68 --> 2769.7599999999998
can be really bad right

2767.76 --> 2771.6800000000003
if your immune system is like already

2769.76 --> 2775.7200000000003
compromised or

2771.68 --> 2775.72
yeah that could be bad

2775.839 --> 2781.839
but if you're like really careful with

2778.0 --> 2783.44
your health and it's just lead

2781.839 --> 2784.88
yeah

2783.44 --> 2786.319
as long as you don't

2784.88 --> 2789.839
get too

2786.319 --> 2789.839
over poisoned by it

2790.0 --> 2795.599
i think you could just get rid of it and

2792.0 --> 2795.599
wouldn't be that much of a problem

2797.119 --> 2801.52
but

2798.24 --> 2804.0789999999997
like it can also i think like really

2801.52 --> 2809.0
burden your brain

2804.079 --> 2809.0
like it's not good for cognitive ability

2826.319 --> 2829.319
hmm

2830.72 --> 2835.04
all right thanks thanks for that george

2832.56 --> 2835.04
sanford

2837.599 --> 2841.92
that poisoning is called saturnism

2843.52 --> 2846.16
that's weird

2848.8 --> 2852.2000000000003
get the plumbism

2874.96 --> 2880.559
would globetart still believe nasa

2877.68 --> 2881.839
if nasa suddenly changed his story

2880.559 --> 2884.4
well no

2881.839 --> 2887.68
it a whole bunch of globetarts already

2884.4 --> 2889.92
don't believe nasa when i didn't really

2887.68 --> 2891.9199999999996
know about flat earth yet or when it

2889.92 --> 2893.76
hadn't crossed like the cognitive

2891.92 --> 2897.359
barrier yet because i already have heard

2893.76 --> 2899.44
of it i just never was able to take it

2897.359 --> 2900.4
then to the next step it really

2899.44 --> 2902.7200000000003
lies like

2900.4 --> 2904.64
yeah maybe it's not

2902.72 --> 2906.0789999999997
it's not actually

2904.64 --> 2908.5589999999997
real maybe

2906.079 --> 2910.48
it's really real

2908.559 --> 2913.2000000000003
when i cross that barrier everything

2910.48 --> 2915.839
changed right

2913.2 --> 2918.0789999999997
but before i even did that

2915.839 --> 2920.88
from my global perspective i already

2918.079 --> 2923.04
like thought like nasa is like

2920.88 --> 2924.319
weird like why did they fake the moon

2923.04 --> 2926.64
landing

2924.319 --> 2928.48
why didn't they actually go

2926.64 --> 2930.4
what are they keeping secret for us why

2928.48 --> 2934.4
are they trying to make us believe like

2930.4 --> 2936.7200000000003
they actually went but then like that

2934.4 --> 2936.7200000000003
right

2938.4 --> 2943.8
but i still thought like yeah we could

2940.4 --> 2943.8
go to space

2944.16 --> 2948.16
and maybe everything is different

2948.88 --> 2954.1600000000003
maybe it's just different maybe like

2950.96 --> 2958.0
there is like a weird flat earth

2954.16 --> 2961.44
thing or something that it's not a ball

2958.0 --> 2963.119
but like maybe we're we're like at the

2961.44 --> 2966.2400000000002
like we're the bottom

2963.119 --> 2968.6400000000003
of a giant funnel

2966.24 --> 2971.7599999999998
and there is like an outer space it's

2968.64 --> 2974.319
just that the universe is not just this

2971.76 --> 2977.6800000000003
basic endless place like yeah

2974.319 --> 2977.68
you can go anywhere

2977.76 --> 2981.76
right

2979.119 --> 2984.6400000000003
once you let go of the rigidity of the

2981.76 --> 2987.0400000000004
institutes and what they claim that is

2984.64 --> 2988.7999999999997
palpably false

2987.04 --> 2992.24
then technically you can

2988.8 --> 2992.2400000000002
let your mind pretty much

2992.48 --> 2998.4
reshape what you think the world is

2995.92 --> 3000.4
in any direction it might not make a lot

2998.4 --> 3002.8
of sense to other people

3000.4 --> 3006.079
but you can still do it and a lot of

3002.8 --> 3006.079
people do do that

3006.88 --> 3013.04
i thought space was fake

3008.96 --> 3016.079
yeah it is i didn't know that yet

3013.04 --> 3019.599
right and even in a way

3016.079 --> 3022.2400000000002
yeah outer space like ooh the vacuum and

3019.599 --> 3024.48
no gravity and like all that void in

3022.24 --> 3027.2799999999997
between the balls

3024.48 --> 3029.04
yeah maybe that doesn't exist at all i'm

3027.28 --> 3030.6400000000003
pretty sure it doesn't

3029.04 --> 3031.52
but

3030.64 --> 3032.48
what

3031.52 --> 3035.359
is

3032.48 --> 3037.44
actually up there

3035.359 --> 3039.359
right

3037.44 --> 3041.52
we don't know

3039.359 --> 3044.7999999999997
that could be all kinds of bizarre

3041.52 --> 3044.8
things up there

3045.119 --> 3050.8
right some people say oh there's water

3047.68 --> 3052.64
out there like literally an ocean

3050.8 --> 3056.1600000000003
or

3052.64 --> 3057.359
all kinds of things like a glass barrier

3056.16 --> 3059.44
or

3057.359 --> 3062.48
like it's just the top and you can go

3059.44 --> 3065.119
through it to another realm like

3062.48 --> 3068.839
people fantasize endlessly about it even

3065.119 --> 3068.839
within flat earth

3069.599 --> 3074.8
right

3070.72 --> 3077.4399999999996
i've speculated like but what if

3074.8 --> 3078.48
for some reason or another there is like

3077.44 --> 3081.04
a

3078.48 --> 3083.28
a region high enough up there where

3081.04 --> 3084.88
relative density simply just doesn't

3083.28 --> 3087.3590000000004
work anymore

3084.88 --> 3089.76
that it would still be contained but

3087.359 --> 3091.5989999999997
maybe it's like at the bottom top part

3089.76 --> 3093.6800000000003
of the container there is like a

3091.599 --> 3097.1600000000003
suspension zone where things just

3093.68 --> 3097.16
freaking float

3098.079 --> 3102.96
and then if you basically move out of

3100.319 --> 3105.68
that suspension zone relative density

3102.96 --> 3107.68
starts to apply again

3105.68 --> 3110.0789999999997
and then you fall because of course

3107.68 --> 3113.2799999999997
you're denser than the median there

3110.079 --> 3115.2000000000003
maybe there is some pla some point where

3113.28 --> 3117.76
literally relative density would be

3115.2 --> 3119.68
suspended formerly thought of as gravity

3117.76 --> 3124.5200000000004
right

3119.68 --> 3124.52
who the hell knows

3128.319 --> 3133.119
like where the frick are all the meteors

3130.8 --> 3134.88
coming from right

3133.119 --> 3136.6400000000003
where are they coming from

3134.88 --> 3139.04
there are some meteors where are they

3136.64 --> 3140.24
coming from

3139.04 --> 3143.599
right

3140.24 --> 3144.3999999999996
maybe there is a suspension zone up

3143.599 --> 3147.52
there

3144.4 --> 3151.96
and it happens to be a place where

3147.52 --> 3151.96
bowlers just go around

3152.24 --> 3156.16
there's just maybe floating rocks up

3154.64 --> 3157.1189999999997
there

3156.16 --> 3159.04
maybe

3157.119 --> 3162.0
like almost like a it would look like a

3159.04 --> 3164.079
meteor belt and it's literally just

3162.0 --> 3166.16
they're floating up there

3164.079 --> 3168.319
and sometimes one of these might just

3166.16 --> 3170.72
kind of be pushed

3168.319 --> 3171.599
like maybe it's not perfectly st hanging

3170.72 --> 3173.5989999999997
still

3171.599 --> 3176.4
maybe it's in the flow and sometimes

3173.599 --> 3178.0
like a rock gets like bounced off and

3176.4 --> 3180.319
then

3178.0 --> 3183.04
moves beyond the relative density

3180.319 --> 3185.119
neutralized zone and starts to fall and

3183.04 --> 3187.599
then becomes a meteor

3185.119 --> 3189.839
it could be

3187.599 --> 3192.1600000000003
i don't know

3189.839 --> 3192.16
you know

3192.96 --> 3197.2
is it possible medias aren't physical no

3197.92 --> 3202.96
but yeah when we see balling stars what

3200.96 --> 3205.44
we associate with falling stars like

3202.96 --> 3206.319
little lights that go

3205.44 --> 3208.319
right

3206.319 --> 3210.24
that's probably not physical i've

3208.319 --> 3212.16
suspected for a long time that that's

3210.24 --> 3214.5589999999997
actually a part of the holographic

3212.16 --> 3217.1189999999997
system of the celestials it's just a

3214.559 --> 3219.2000000000003
quick moving celestial light

3217.119 --> 3220.559
but there are

3219.2 --> 3223.5989999999997
rocks

3220.559 --> 3226.1600000000003
that do come down

3223.599 --> 3228.88
and then you like literally

3226.16 --> 3230.16
can see them explode

3228.88 --> 3233.04
and they

3230.16 --> 3235.359
make a fiery roary sound and they leave

3233.04 --> 3239.359
smoke behind that's not

3235.359 --> 3241.52
a hologram that's not a celestial blip

3239.359 --> 3244.0789999999997
right so where the hell are those things

3241.52 --> 3244.079
coming from

3245.2 --> 3249.04
right

3246.96 --> 3251.52
until you can literally prove there's a

3249.04 --> 3254.319
station that that just lo that shoots

3251.52 --> 3255.92
off these giant meteors

3254.319 --> 3257.359
just to kind of pretend like they're

3255.92 --> 3259.76
coming down

3257.359 --> 3262.24
until you prove that

3259.76 --> 3264.88
it is a mystery where these things come

3262.24 --> 3267.2799999999997
from

3264.88 --> 3269.92
they might be coming from up there

3267.28 --> 3269.92
somehow

3270.319 --> 3275.52
right how how would they come be there

3273.359 --> 3276.96
up there well

3275.52 --> 3280.079
maybe there is a

3276.96 --> 3282.079
region high enough high up enough

3280.079 --> 3286.079
way beyond like the balloon zone where

3282.079 --> 3287.76
suddenly relative density is neutralized

3286.079 --> 3289.04
and there's just like

3287.76 --> 3293.8390000000004
boulders

3289.04 --> 3293.839
giant rocks just floating up there

3296.64 --> 3302.72
and some of them might come down

3300.16 --> 3302.72
i don't know

3305.359 --> 3310.52
meteors are coming from somewhere you

3307.52 --> 3310.52
know

3332.48 --> 3338.4
maybe some sort of advance yeah but

3335.68 --> 3340.799
flatter sage

3338.4 --> 3342.4
maybe yeah maybe it's man-made maybe

3340.799 --> 3345.2
there's a thing where they do that yeah

3342.4 --> 3347.839
yeah we'll prove it then right if it's

3345.2 --> 3352.24
coming from the ground

3347.839 --> 3352.24
must be a way to prove that

3354.079 --> 3359.92
and i mean there's like freaking cameras

3356.799 --> 3360.799
and internet everywhere

3359.92 --> 3363.52
so

3360.799 --> 3366.96
at some point somebody must be able to

3363.52 --> 3369.44
pick off pick up that oh there's this

3366.96 --> 3371.599
institute here or whatever

3369.44 --> 3374.96
or maybe an astronomical and they just

3371.599 --> 3377.119
fired off this big rock

3374.96 --> 3378.48
like what the [ __ ]

3377.119 --> 3381.92
right

3378.48 --> 3383.839
some kind of hint any sort or like even

3381.92 --> 3385.92
from a did maybe they're firing the

3383.839 --> 3387.359
freaking meteors

3385.92 --> 3388.4
like from

3387.359 --> 3390.88
like

3388.4 --> 3392.96
area 51 or something

3390.88 --> 3395.359
in the desert well you're still gonna be

3392.96 --> 3398.2400000000002
able to see something being fired from a

3395.359 --> 3398.24
distance right

3400.48 --> 3406.0
if it's like gonna be

3403.119 --> 3409.359
big enough to like literally be an

3406.0 --> 3411.76
exploding rock when it comes down

3409.359 --> 3414.24
you must be able to pick up something

3411.76 --> 3416.7200000000003
being fired off like that

3414.24 --> 3419.4399999999996
from the ground

3416.72 --> 3421.839
i mean the chances of literally some sad

3419.44 --> 3424.0
loon hanging up there or a giant blimp

3421.839 --> 3426.48
firing those things off are pretty much

3424.0 --> 3426.48
zero

3428.64 --> 3433.92
like really something is going to

3430.88 --> 3436.1600000000003
literally lift off

3433.92 --> 3438.2400000000002
a giant rock up there with all that

3436.16 --> 3441.7599999999998
weight that's crazy

3438.24 --> 3441.7599999999998
it's super inefficient

3442.559 --> 3448.0
right because i'm pretty sure mankind

3445.119 --> 3453.799
does not have a device to penetrate

3448.0 --> 3453.799
beyond like the zeppelin balloon zone

3468.24 --> 3473.1189999999997
never seen one impacting on the earth

3470.079 --> 3474.799
yeah okay cow apple i get that i have

3473.119 --> 3477.119
actually seen

3474.799 --> 3478.24
falling stars

3477.119 --> 3480.88
like

3478.24 --> 3482.0
with sound where they literally came

3480.88 --> 3484.559
down

3482.0 --> 3487.52
at maybe a few hundred meters away and

3484.559 --> 3489.92
would literally see them

3487.52 --> 3491.119
like glittering metal

3489.92 --> 3492.799
you know like

3491.119 --> 3494.88
those little little

3492.799 --> 3498.88
star sticks

3494.88 --> 3500.799
that that's like a iron oxide burning up

3498.88 --> 3503.359
something like that with

3500.799 --> 3505.44
you know it would look and literally

3503.359 --> 3508.4
sound like that

3505.44 --> 3510.799
yeah i had seen like a meteor basically

3508.4 --> 3513.6800000000003
coming down and burning up

3510.799 --> 3516.559
at ground level

3513.68 --> 3518.3999999999996
like in my sight that was like

3516.559 --> 3521.599
astounding like

3518.4 --> 3521.599
is that a falling star

3522.4 --> 3527.52
and not just like

3524.4 --> 3527.52
no literally like

3529.04 --> 3531.839
what the [ __ ]

3533.28 --> 3536.96
they don't explode well sometimes they

3535.28 --> 3540.96
just burn up

3536.96 --> 3543.92
that's what i saw i literally saw that

3540.96 --> 3546.4
like i couldn't couldn't be a bigger

3543.92 --> 3548.559
wish like right if you literally see a

3546.4 --> 3550.319
falling star like pretty much right in

3548.559 --> 3551.8390000000004
front of you

3550.319 --> 3554.079
it's not the first time i've seen that

3551.839 --> 3556.4
even as a kid i've seen that a couple of

3554.079 --> 3556.4
times

3556.96 --> 3562.64
the last time i saw that was in

3559.68 --> 3562.64
2000

3566.0 --> 3568.559
14.

3570.079 --> 3574.319
why do they burn because of metal

3574.48 --> 3578.96
because

3575.28 --> 3578.96
it's the metal burning right

3584.96 --> 3589.68
it regenerates what are you talking

3587.44 --> 3589.68
about

3590.079 --> 3594.52
no it's not chunks of the firmament

3602.799 --> 3607.52
but why cause them to burn in the i

3605.28 --> 3608.7200000000003
don't know

3607.52 --> 3612.16
maybe that

3608.72 --> 3614.4399999999996
like whatever is up there falling down

3612.16 --> 3617.2799999999997
maybe it goes through like a

3614.44 --> 3619.04
polarization depolarization something

3617.28 --> 3619.8390000000004
electrical

3619.04 --> 3622.5589999999997
like

3619.839 --> 3627.119
some field electrical field

3622.559 --> 3627.119
that kind of just causes it to ignite

3627.359 --> 3629.839
right

3636.0 --> 3640.76
plasma gasification what

3653.31 --> 3658.72
[Music]

3656.079 --> 3661.28
no matthew hall

3658.72 --> 3663.359
it's ridiculous

3661.28 --> 3665.52
there's it's not things breaking off the

3663.359 --> 3668.0789999999997
firmament and you can't damage the

3665.52 --> 3670.4
firmament yeah if things supposedly

3668.079 --> 3674.1600000000003
break off from the firmament to fall

3670.4 --> 3676.559
create falling stars like if that's real

3674.16 --> 3679.5989999999997
then that means that if they even

3676.559 --> 3682.4
shot up nukes against the firmament dude

3679.599 --> 3684.96
you know how much freaking metal debris

3682.4 --> 3688.2400000000002
would have been falling down

3684.96 --> 3690.64
right after it would be non-stop falling

3688.24 --> 3692.4799999999996
stars non-stop

3690.64 --> 3694.72
it would have seemed like there is an

3692.48 --> 3697.599
apocalyptic

3694.72 --> 3700.16
meteor rain okay that's what would have

3697.599 --> 3703.3590000000004
happened if meat years are actually

3700.16 --> 3705.839
pieces of debris from the firmament

3703.359 --> 3708.96
falling off and they shot those nukes

3705.839 --> 3711.44
there's just no way think logically

3708.96 --> 3713.76
there would have been a worldwide visual

3711.44 --> 3717.039
event like holy [ __ ] there's a meteor

3713.76 --> 3719.2000000000003
storm coming down now

3717.039 --> 3719.92
it's no

3719.2 --> 3721.0389999999998
no

3719.92 --> 3723.92
no

3721.039 --> 3726.6400000000003
there is no piece of an architecture

3723.92 --> 3729.039
that's slowly crumbling that makes no

3726.64 --> 3729.0389999999998
sense

3730.799 --> 3736.88
that already just implies oh then there

3734.48 --> 3739.92
is something outside of the ferment oh

3736.88 --> 3742.2400000000002
you want your eternal galaxy again the

3739.92 --> 3746.559
infinite space

3742.24 --> 3746.5589999999997
we want the infinite space back no

3746.88 --> 3751.6800000000003
i don't think like the firmament is an

3749.2 --> 3751.68
actual

3751.92 --> 3757.76
physical construction within

3755.599 --> 3760.319
physical space

3757.76 --> 3761.28
i think it's simply the barrier

3760.319 --> 3763.92
to where

3761.28 --> 3766.96
physical space and availab

3763.92 --> 3769.44
availability for material to move into

3766.96 --> 3771.52
ends that's what i think the firmament

3769.44 --> 3774.0
is i don't think it's actually a

3771.52 --> 3776.559
physical design construct

3774.0 --> 3776.559
construct

3778.16 --> 3782.64
it's not meant to mix it that's [ __ ]

3781.52 --> 3784.48
like

3782.64 --> 3786.0789999999997
why would you ever invoke something like

3784.48 --> 3789.28
that

3786.079 --> 3792.1600000000003
something is meant to make sense no

3789.28 --> 3795.2000000000003
it is there it is something or it isn't

3792.16 --> 3797.52
there and it isn't something

3795.2 --> 3801.0389999999998
there are no things that are not meant

3797.52 --> 3801.0389999999998
to make sense okay

3802.24 --> 3807.68
everything has to make sense because it

3805.28 --> 3810.799
exists

3807.68 --> 3812.96
everything that exists has to make sense

3810.799 --> 3815.359
if it doesn't make sense it doesn't

3812.96 --> 3815.359
exist

3820.64 --> 3826.0789999999997
or you simply don't understand

3823.119 --> 3827.44
but like you can never say it can never

3826.079 --> 3830.319
be understood

3827.44 --> 3834.64
if there is something to be beheld

3830.319 --> 3838.0
then it technically must be able to be

3834.64 --> 3841.2
understood might be extremely hard yeah

3838.0 --> 3841.2
but it must be able

3841.76 --> 3846.559
logic

3843.76 --> 3848.2400000000002
nothing can exist that doesn't make

3846.559 --> 3850.8390000000004
sense

3848.24 --> 3853.2799999999997
just maybe very

3850.839 --> 3854.5589999999997
difficult you might not have the

3853.28 --> 3857.76
available

3854.559 --> 3861.28
reflective resources intellectually to

3857.76 --> 3864.4
be able to envision how it could be what

3861.28 --> 3867.039
it is right that doesn't mean it can't

3864.4 --> 3870.64
make sense it just means you can't make

3867.039 --> 3871.92
sense of it right chaos doesn't exist

3870.64 --> 3877.48
chaos

3871.92 --> 3877.48
is caused by fatigue of the mind

3888.64 --> 3891.64
hmm

3918.799 --> 3922.68
oh shut up akumu

3924.64 --> 3930.48
why don't you get back on the fpd

3927.599 --> 3933.76
discord you said you would go on

3930.48 --> 3937.4
but are you scared akumu are you scared

3933.76 --> 3937.4
for another treatment

3956.72 --> 3962.0789999999997
the sun and moon are there

3959.52 --> 3963.44
what do you mean are there timothy

3962.079 --> 3967.2000000000003
jordan

3963.44 --> 3969.839
the sun and moon are not anywhere

3967.2 --> 3971.4399999999996
they're holograms they don't have a

3969.839 --> 3974.48
physical body

3971.44 --> 3976.96
they don't have an actual position

3974.48 --> 3978.799
there's only light

3976.96 --> 3980.88
arriving here

3978.799 --> 3984.24
there is no origin point they aren't

3980.88 --> 3986.559
anywhere they are not in any region

3984.24 --> 3989.2799999999997
on any height

3986.559 --> 3993.079
there's only an appearance of them in

3989.28 --> 3993.079
relation to the observer

4004.4 --> 4008.88
yeah there is no point where oh that

4006.799 --> 4010.88
that's where all the that's the energy

4008.88 --> 4013.839
is stronger there because that's like

4010.88 --> 4016.1600000000003
where the sun is so there the heat is

4013.839 --> 4019.599
more intense no no there is no such

4016.16 --> 4020.72
point there is no such place

4019.599 --> 4023.3590000000004
yeah

4020.72 --> 4026.0
it's not like a heat lamp you get closer

4023.359 --> 4029.68
to it it becomes hotter there is no

4026.0 --> 4029.68
evidence for that whatsoever

4029.839 --> 4035.68
it's non-local it's a hologram

4033.44 --> 4038.559
sun and moon do not have actual

4035.68 --> 4040.5589999999997
positions they are not actual objects

4038.559 --> 4043.599
giving off light

4040.559 --> 4045.3590000000004
they're a side effect of the light

4043.599 --> 4048.2400000000002
manifest

4045.359 --> 4050.64
and they appear to us in the form of

4048.24 --> 4052.64
holograms

4050.64 --> 4054.0
light

4052.64 --> 4056.72
images

4054.0 --> 4059.319
that specifically are like

4056.72 --> 4063.839
a central blueprint

4059.319 --> 4067.839
manifestation of that sort of light

4063.839 --> 4069.68
correlating with that specific angle

4067.839 --> 4071.92
right this is why

4069.68 --> 4074.16
solar eclipses

4071.92 --> 4077.039
give off shadows

4074.16 --> 4078.0789999999997
that are solar eclipse

4077.039 --> 4079.5200000000004
like

4078.079 --> 4081.2000000000003
shaped

4079.52 --> 4083.52
that's that effect

4081.2 --> 4086.16
because it's a hologram and basically at

4083.52 --> 4088.64
the center of every single

4086.16 --> 4091.52
piece of light every single ray of light

4088.64 --> 4093.1189999999997
i don't give a [ __ ] what people call

4091.52 --> 4094.88
what say about that

4093.119 --> 4096.4800000000005
i'm not going to say particle because

4094.88 --> 4098.08
it's [ __ ]

4096.48 --> 4100.239
it's not a traveling thing it's not a

4098.08 --> 4104.08
minimum unit

4100.239 --> 4108.959999999999
beam is the best description be more re

4104.08 --> 4110.4
and every single beam has the hologram

4108.96 --> 4113.44
tincture

4110.4 --> 4117.12
signature within every beam you

4113.44 --> 4119.3589999999995
understand every beam from the sun

4117.12 --> 4124.239
the at the minimum

4119.359 --> 4127.359
size has the hologram signature of the

4124.239 --> 4131.12
sun disc within it every single beam

4127.359 --> 4132.400000000001
right the same goes for the moon every

4131.12 --> 4135.839
moon beam

4132.4 --> 4138.159
as a holographic signature of the moon

4135.839 --> 4139.759
disk within it

4138.159 --> 4145.239
that's

4139.759 --> 4145.239
best i can do to try and explain it

4146.96 --> 4150.08
i still don't know how you can be sure

4148.64 --> 4152.56
of this well i can be sure of this

4150.08 --> 4155.199
because of the complete and utter lack

4152.56 --> 4157.92
of evidence of the contrary

4155.199 --> 4160.719
and there's already these signs right

4157.92 --> 4163.52
there right

4160.719 --> 4165.759
there is palpable evidence that that

4163.52 --> 4167.279
supports my position of the celestial

4165.759 --> 4170.239
being holograms

4167.279 --> 4171.679
there is no palpable evidence that

4170.239 --> 4174.0
supports them

4171.679 --> 4176.56
not being a hologram but an object

4174.0 --> 4178.719
instead in the euclidean position zero

4176.56 --> 4181.679
there is no supporting evidence for that

4178.719 --> 4183.679
only physicality assumptions

4181.679 --> 4186.359
physically as bias

4183.679 --> 4189.679
physicality assumption bias

4186.359 --> 4191.120000000001
motivations to assume that they are

4189.679 --> 4193.12
that's the only thing that's around

4191.12 --> 4196.159
there's no actual evidence that

4193.12 --> 4199.28
indicates they are objects in euclidean

4196.159 --> 4203.08
positions at all but there is evidence

4199.28 --> 4203.08
that they are holographic

4203.199 --> 4207.36
right

4205.04 --> 4210.88
like eclipse

4207.36 --> 4210.88
shaped shadows

4215.52 --> 4221.280000000001
you should go to the most prestigious

4217.28 --> 4221.28
universities and teach my findings

4221.76 --> 4224.159000000001
maybe

4225.6 --> 4229.719
i mean i'm right here

4231.52 --> 4234.64
what are they going to do on a

4232.719 --> 4236.56
university with it you know are they

4234.64 --> 4238.0
going to actually do something with it

4236.56 --> 4241.6
my

4238.0 --> 4243.76
my studies my conceptions my model

4241.6 --> 4246.400000000001
is directly

4243.76 --> 4249.12
in opposition to the standard narrative

4246.4 --> 4251.12
so why i don't know any university that

4249.12 --> 4255.239
would really embrace that

4251.12 --> 4255.239
that patrick hoon

4261.76 --> 4264.88
their insights are

4263.44 --> 4266.799999999999
a revelation

4264.88 --> 4268.96
i thank you

4266.8 --> 4270.84
i'm trying to do that

4268.96 --> 4273.679
it's just

4270.84 --> 4276.0
that i'm right here i'm saying it right

4273.679 --> 4278.8
here and all i can do is that people

4276.0 --> 4282.64
that are really seeing it or that are

4278.8 --> 4282.64
interested will find me

4282.88 --> 4285.1990000000005
and

4285.36 --> 4291.92
dude if somebody would like invite me to

4288.0 --> 4294.56
a university to do that i'd be like yeah

4291.92 --> 4296.88
i'll do it i won't even be too nervous

4294.56 --> 4299.4400000000005
to do it if i'm going to be invited but

4296.88 --> 4300.719
if i have to be the one that's like oh

4299.44 --> 4303.599999999999
hi

4300.719 --> 4305.76
i'm a theorist about this thing yeah

4303.6 --> 4308.159000000001
dude what kind of

4305.76 --> 4310.400000000001
they're just gonna like make me try to

4308.159 --> 4314.159
conform to some other [ __ ] then

4310.4 --> 4316.879999999999
right no it would have to be an invite

4314.159 --> 4319.44
like people that are that really want me

4316.88 --> 4321.76
and my ideas

4319.44 --> 4321.759999999999
there

4322.4 --> 4326.96
that's how it's got to work

4324.48 --> 4329.04
like if i'm going there like hi i want

4326.96 --> 4330.88
to have lectures about these fringe

4329.04 --> 4332.96
ideas it's like how do you think that's

4330.88 --> 4335.36
going to work out

4332.96 --> 4338.56
that they might see me like oh so it's a

4335.36 --> 4340.88
curiosity oh we're this is the curiosity

4338.56 --> 4344.0
clause of the year

4340.88 --> 4345.6
that that means that nobody gives a [ __ ]

4344.0 --> 4348.96
that nobody's actually gonna pay

4345.6 --> 4349.84
attention because it's

4348.96 --> 4354.92
just

4349.84 --> 4354.92
a weird little curiosity thing right

4356.96 --> 4361.199
but if people would invite me

4362.56 --> 4368.64
one day books will be written about you

4365.36 --> 4371.839999999999
wow patrick hoon that's

4368.64 --> 4371.84
yeah sure

4374.239 --> 4378.4
i mean

4375.52 --> 4383.1990000000005
i want to write a book about this

4378.4 --> 4385.199
it's just that i don't know really

4383.199 --> 4390.0
how to do that and

4385.199 --> 4390.0
my ideas are like still in development

4392.56 --> 4396.8
also like i've never really written a

4394.64 --> 4398.8
book about such things

4396.8 --> 4401.84
i've never really written anything that

4398.8 --> 4401.84
isn't very short

4404.719 --> 4409.6
i've already tried doing it some time

4407.28 --> 4411.599999999999
ago but then it kind of just got stuck

4409.6 --> 4415.76
it's like how am i gonna

4411.6 --> 4415.76
how the hell am i gonna translate this

4415.92 --> 4420.96
because i don't know how to turn it into

4417.84 --> 4423.28
like a readable book

4420.96 --> 4425.28
what's the source of my hologram it's

4423.28 --> 4428.239
not my hologram

4425.28 --> 4431.5199999999995
it's the terrestrial hologram the

4428.239 --> 4433.04
celestial demisphere

4431.52 --> 4434.96
what's the source

4433.04 --> 4438.239
well the only source that i could think

4434.96 --> 4441.52
of is electrical and that electrical

4438.239 --> 4444.159
would be inherent to the realm

4441.52 --> 4446.88
right it i've conceived

4444.159 --> 4448.639999999999
without any direct evidence for it just

4446.88 --> 4451.4400000000005
as a conception that

4448.64 --> 4454.159000000001
the electrical ether which is the same

4451.44 --> 4456.08
one that tesla

4454.159 --> 4458.799999999999
dealt with

4456.08 --> 4462.32
that that is the thing that actually

4458.8 --> 4462.320000000001
feeds the celestial light

4462.56 --> 4467.52
that there is this energy going through

4465.04 --> 4469.84
everything including the energy of life

4467.52 --> 4469.84
itself

4469.92 --> 4475.12
that is the same energy that feeds the

4472.56 --> 4476.56
celestial lights including the sun to do

4475.12 --> 4481.4
what it does

4476.56 --> 4481.400000000001
so it would be like a feedback loop

4486.56 --> 4490.96
earth is a battery right right yeah

4492.8 --> 4497.84
alex michael's book i don't know who

4494.64 --> 4497.84
that is jess palmer

4505.6 --> 4509.1990000000005
right

4507.36 --> 4511.679
so i hope that answers your question

4509.199 --> 4512.5599999999995
howard moore

4511.679 --> 4515.52
yeah

4512.56 --> 4518.080000000001
it's electrical it would have to be

4515.52 --> 4521.4400000000005
electricity is the only thing we could

4518.08 --> 4524.08
even conceive of that would involve

4521.44 --> 4527.919999999999
the creation of holograms

4524.08 --> 4527.92
other than just mirror trickery

4528.719 --> 4531.36
right

4529.6 --> 4532.8
because you could technically make

4531.36 --> 4534.639999999999
holograms

4532.8 --> 4536.88
fueled by

4534.64 --> 4540.400000000001
combustion fire like

4536.88 --> 4542.8
candles candle fire or oil

4540.4 --> 4545.36
and then with mirrors kind of

4542.8 --> 4548.400000000001
sort of give a hologram effect

4545.36 --> 4550.96
but like a real hologram

4548.4 --> 4554.239
usually involves electricity

4550.96 --> 4556.2390000000005
and like the electrifying of gases as

4554.239 --> 4558.48
light

4556.239 --> 4558.48
right

4558.64 --> 4565.8
like a light bulb it's basically

4560.4 --> 4565.799999999999
electrified gas and then that lights up

4566.32 --> 4573.679
well that's not what's going on up there

4568.4 --> 4573.679
it's not locally electrified gas

4574.96 --> 4580.32
but there is electricity

4577.679 --> 4582.4800000000005
everywhere palpably

4580.32 --> 4585.36
and that might be the thing that's

4582.48 --> 4586.879999999999
feeding into the holographic manifest of

4585.36 --> 4588.639999999999
the celestials

4586.88 --> 4591.76
but not

4588.64 --> 4592.96
palpably like i don't know how i can't

4591.76 --> 4596.8
actually

4592.96 --> 4599.199
like form a palpable bridge there for

4596.8 --> 4601.6
how it would be doing that it's just

4599.199 --> 4603.04
that yeah it's light it is all that

4601.6 --> 4604.96
energy in there

4603.04 --> 4606.84
the only thing i could think of that

4604.96 --> 4609.44
would feed into that is

4606.84 --> 4612.4800000000005
electrical and there is electricity

4609.44 --> 4615.5199999999995
around measurably in the air

4612.48 --> 4619.12
now how that actually then

4615.52 --> 4621.6
connects as a circuit in order to feed

4619.12 --> 4624.64
into the celestial light that part i

4621.6 --> 4627.679
don't know i don't know

4624.64 --> 4627.679
i don't know how

4628.88 --> 4634.4800000000005
right especially because it is so

4631.6 --> 4637.280000000001
constant it's not like a periodic thing

4634.48 --> 4639.678999999999
that just like oh there it goes like

4637.28 --> 4642.5599999999995
like a lightning storm is

4639.679 --> 4645.6
the lightning storm is exists to

4642.56 --> 4647.360000000001
recharge the celestials right something

4645.6 --> 4648.84
like that

4647.36 --> 4651.679
i'm pretty sure it's

4648.84 --> 4653.76
not although

4651.679 --> 4655.52
i don't know maybe it just

4653.76 --> 4656.56
maybe it is

4655.52 --> 4658.0
how

4656.56 --> 4659.360000000001
how

4658.0 --> 4661.44
i don't know

4659.36 --> 4666.4
but maybe there is like there needs to

4661.44 --> 4671.36
be like a charging of the firmament

4666.4 --> 4671.36
in order to generate the celestial light

4672.0 --> 4677.199
i think in general too it's like

4674.719 --> 4679.84
there's like real thunderstorms

4677.199 --> 4681.5199999999995
and then afterward the sky is all clean

4679.84 --> 4683.6
right it goes away and then you get like

4681.52 --> 4687.1990000000005
the crisp clear skies

4683.6 --> 4689.84
you also get pretty astounding

4687.199 --> 4692.48
strong celestial light you see very

4689.84 --> 4694.56
bright stars all of a sudden maybe the

4692.48 --> 4695.5199999999995
sun is also brighter

4694.56 --> 4699.280000000001
so

4695.52 --> 4701.4400000000005
maybe i just like randomly pulled that

4699.28 --> 4704.48
like oh maybe lightning storms are there

4701.44 --> 4707.839999999999
to charge the celestials

4704.48 --> 4707.839999999999
well maybe they are

4708.719 --> 4712.96
baby they are

4710.159 --> 4712.96
it's weird

4714.08 --> 4717.48
i don't know

4721.679 --> 4726.719
there are computer programs that can

4723.6 --> 4726.719
help you right now

4731.44 --> 4734.839999999999
martin luther

4752.8 --> 4757.28
the sky would be a huge battery

4754.8 --> 4760.56
generating electrostatic downward action

4757.28 --> 4760.5599999999995
no no it wouldn't

4760.8 --> 4764.96
now that's absolutely

4763.04 --> 4766.239
not true

4764.96 --> 4769.52
not true

4766.239 --> 4772.08
pretty much no matter what

4769.52 --> 4775.4400000000005
everything out there is

4772.08 --> 4778.32
that is not what it is yeah

4775.44 --> 4779.36
this relative density situation that

4778.32 --> 4781.599999999999
we're in

4779.36 --> 4784.88
it's not electrostatic

4781.6 --> 4788.4800000000005
at all zero percent zero

4784.88 --> 4790.8
you know why because electrostatics

4788.48 --> 4793.5199999999995
are measurable

4790.8 --> 4794.56
have a very limited reach

4793.52 --> 4795.84
and they're

4794.56 --> 4797.679
not

4795.84 --> 4800.719
coherent

4797.679 --> 4802.88
yeah that means there is no universal

4800.719 --> 4804.56
direction that can be achieved with

4802.88 --> 4806.400000000001
electrostatics

4804.56 --> 4808.56
there isn't

4806.4 --> 4811.92
so it's never

4808.56 --> 4813.92
going to turn out to be that gravity

4811.92 --> 4815.36
or relative density which is what it

4813.92 --> 4816.719
really is

4815.36 --> 4821.199
is caused

4816.719 --> 4824.639
or involved any form of electrostatics

4821.199 --> 4826.799999999999
100 percent excluded from being possible

4824.639 --> 4828.88
on the level chris 100

4826.8 --> 4832.679
i guarantee it to you

4828.88 --> 4832.679
100 impossible

4834.32 --> 4837.92
incoherent force part what the hell does

4836.4 --> 4841.12
that even mean

4837.92 --> 4843.36
what the hell is a force particle

4841.12 --> 4845.92
dude

4843.36 --> 4848.639
if you've been reading like sci-fi weird

4845.92 --> 4851.1990000000005
technobabble [ __ ]

4848.639 --> 4853.28
that doesn't make any sense

4851.199 --> 4856.4
a forced particle that's not a thing

4853.28 --> 4856.4
that makes no sense

4856.56 --> 4861.92
a particle cannot be a force a force

4859.44 --> 4864.799999999999
cannot be a particle

4861.92 --> 4867.52
it doesn't make sense

4864.8 --> 4869.52
how does a hologram produce energy oh it

4867.52 --> 4872.639
does yeah you can get a tan from a

4869.52 --> 4875.52
hologram howard moore

4872.639 --> 4878.2390000000005
do i have to say it another thousand

4875.52 --> 4881.84
times i've had a show literally titled

4878.239 --> 4884.4
that twice now yeah a hologram can give

4881.84 --> 4887.04
you a 10. if the energy input is strong

4884.4 --> 4888.719
enough you can sit and look at a

4887.04 --> 4893.5199999999995
hologram

4888.719 --> 4897.92
and literally get a tan

4893.52 --> 4901.280000000001
that's how a hologram produces energy

4897.92 --> 4905.28
yeah the light when intense enough

4901.28 --> 4905.28
literally can give you a tan

4907.04 --> 4912.56
don't ask that question again you know

4910.08 --> 4912.5599999999995
it can

4914.239 --> 4918.799999999999
incoherent force particles make sense no

4916.4 --> 4918.799999999999
it doesn't

4923.199 --> 4927.239
all right see you later godzilla

4931.12 --> 4937.36
oh psych bear you yeah fight the flatter

4934.0 --> 4937.36
it says a lot of dumb things

4938.239 --> 4945.239
although i really

4939.92 --> 4945.2390000000005
nothing can t like top brenda though

4959.199 --> 4964.44
no it's not

4960.96 --> 4964.44
stop it

4976.8 --> 4980.0
you know what's the future

4980.48 --> 4984.36
not watching porn

4990.4 --> 4995.799999999999
the future is getting rid of sex

4992.8 --> 4995.8
addiction

5010.719 --> 5015.719
aren't we a natural phenomenon no

5034.96 --> 5040.4
which one is man-made stuff under it's

5037.199 --> 5043.759999999999
under synthetic man-made yeah

5040.4 --> 5046.638999999999
don't present a false dichotomy

5043.76 --> 5047.6
it's natural supernatural

5046.639 --> 5049.84
and

5047.6 --> 5052.96
synthetic

5049.84 --> 5052.96
it's a trinity

5053.6 --> 5057.4400000000005
understand

5054.8 --> 5059.679
it's not natural supernatural take your

5057.44 --> 5061.599999999999
pick no you forgot synthetic that's the

5059.679 --> 5064.6
third part

5061.6 --> 5064.6
man-made

5090.8 --> 5096.84
no it isn't a kumu virus you [ __ ]

5094.48 --> 5100.638999999999
you're wrong

5096.84 --> 5102.400000000001
stop lying to yourself

5100.639 --> 5104.4400000000005
it's not

5102.4 --> 5106.0
it's natural

5104.44 --> 5108.4
supernatural

5106.0 --> 5111.28
and synthetic

5108.4 --> 5112.4
within physics

5111.28 --> 5114.8
you're

5112.4 --> 5114.799999999999
wrong

5121.52 --> 5125.4400000000005
yeah don't take your yeah i won't take

5123.28 --> 5128.32
your word for it i don't know what

5125.44 --> 5132.638999999999
kindergarten [ __ ] site you you used

5128.32 --> 5132.639
for this yeah you're wrong

5133.679 --> 5140.12
it is three options natural supernatural

5137.12 --> 5140.12
man-made

5143.73 --> 5147.36
[Music]

5145.12 --> 5149.679
but you also i don't need to look it up

5147.36 --> 5152.32
i faced that [ __ ]

5149.679 --> 5154.8
for like hundreds of hours through the

5152.32 --> 5157.36
flat earth debate and through ball

5154.8 --> 5159.28
busters yeah i don't need to look it up

5157.36 --> 5164.48
i know what it is

5159.28 --> 5164.48
it's natural supernatural and synthetic

5166.32 --> 5172.88
akuma virus stop repeating that error or

5170.639 --> 5177.159000000001
at this point that lie

5172.88 --> 5177.159000000001
or i'm going to time you out

5194.08 --> 5198.96
yeah do that you just leave yeah that's

5196.239 --> 5198.959999999999
right bye

5199.84 --> 5205.92
why don't you go present your case with

5202.239 --> 5206.799999999999
your evidence and your sources on fed

5205.92 --> 5209.52
yeah
