interested right so today weather today

90.14 --> 99.29
again right back to beautiful very warm

96.55 --> 106.39
see the Sun seems to be behind the cloud

99.29 --> 110.99000000000001
right now but it barely is very warm and

106.39 --> 115.819
yeah people are enjoying the weather

110.99 --> 123.679
outside and order at work because it's

115.819 --> 127.7
Monday of course pretty pretty nice and

123.679 --> 132.76
I'm wearing my white shirt again because

127.7 --> 140.12
I don't know it feels more pleasant yeah

132.76 --> 142.91
it just feels a little fresher right so

140.12 --> 144.55
I got green tea with me and special

142.91 --> 147.82999999999998
treats

144.55 --> 152.02
really nice looking blueberries let's

147.83 --> 152.02
check that out really big ones

154.28 --> 157.09
hmm

167.4 --> 172.93
yeah white shirt Robin Stanley it is it

171.099 --> 177.28
it really is that type of weather to

172.93 --> 181.06
just go to a park somewhere and the

177.28 --> 185.609
blanket didn't lie there or sunbathing

181.06 --> 185.609
of some kind maybe at the beach

191.56 --> 205.78
hmm anyway let's go through check hm was

200.319 --> 213.60999999999999
first daylight Ohio stopping traffic in

205.78 --> 216.4
my rested see man point to zoom who what

213.61 --> 225.16000000000003
seems to have been triggered by my my

216.4 --> 227.61
hangout title he disagrees which is very

225.16 --> 227.60999999999999
smart of him

231.84 --> 243.209
right Sabbath Robert Stanley Amanda

239.91 --> 253.16
young good to see you later

243.209 --> 257.72
gee thank you have a 1o1 rockhound

253.16 --> 260.239
I'm sorry Ted Cassidy know a little Neil

257.72 --> 275.94000000000005
yeah I think I got you all of you now

260.239 --> 277.2
good morning what was I doing yesterday

275.94 --> 279.36
I'm again

277.2 --> 283.86
yeah it's every time it's like this Bob

279.36 --> 285.84000000000003
whether I'm just so relaxed and yeah you

283.86 --> 290.69
as I've been very open about it

285.84 --> 293.60999999999996
you should take like a smoke before

290.69 --> 296.49
before the Hangout but when it's that

293.61 --> 301.37
warm I sometimes forget that I can get a

296.49 --> 308.7
bit de ze from it so it takes it some

301.37 --> 310.65
time for me to get rolling and I've

308.7 --> 313.169
always seemed to have trouble starting

310.65 --> 316.67999999999995
up my show I think that is also why I

313.169 --> 319.229
have such a long routine because to me

316.68 --> 324.12
it's easier to follow the routine than

319.229 --> 326.52
to actually get it started if I just

324.12 --> 328.86
would have to get starting right away I

326.52 --> 332.19
would probably be a little flustered I

328.86 --> 337.66900000000004
had some issues with that with the flat

332.19 --> 337.669
earth talks too sometimes anyway

340.41 --> 344.73
they doing all kinds of things yesterday

346.29 --> 354.42
just have to remember what it was

349.09 --> 354.41999999999996
oh and Benjamin twice that was good

357.21 --> 363.52
gotta get that car back yeah also I

361.36 --> 366.82
completely watched the entire episode

363.52 --> 369.54999999999995
from yesterday back and yeah I was

366.82 --> 373.33
really worried at the end of it I even

369.55 --> 376.45
conveyed conveyed that even during the

373.33 --> 381.52
show but looking back afterward it's

376.45 --> 383.77
like yeah I get it why I felt that bad

381.52 --> 391.21
but technically it wasn't really that

383.77 --> 396.21
bad I've I've I've been worse so yeah at

391.21 --> 398.76
least I'm not Restless in any sort hmm

396.21 --> 401.56
what is the importance of water vapor

398.76 --> 405.76
well it's not so much the importance of

401.56 --> 412.63
water vapor as understanding how things

405.76 --> 414.06
work and what is what and especially if

412.63 --> 416.5
there's a whole swath of people

414.06 --> 418.45
basically claiming some kind of

416.5 --> 423.669
intellectual authority over another

418.45 --> 429.49
group of people and then yeah trying to

423.669 --> 431.89
make fun of us by claiming that it's

429.49 --> 434.71000000000004
just ridiculous and that when what yeah

431.89 --> 438.28
water doesn't turn into a gas it's just

434.71 --> 441.60999999999996
floating liquid droplets that are very

438.28 --> 445.9
small hanging in between the gas that's

441.61 --> 448.0
what they think and yeah they've doubled

445.9 --> 450.48999999999995
down on it there's multiple ballers in

448.0 --> 452.5
chats maybe they did they're just shown

450.49 --> 455.38
hawking fans or something I don't know

452.5 --> 457.63
what that is but that just keep on

455.38 --> 462.6
coming back like yeah it's it's wrong

457.63 --> 462.6
and it just baffles me

464.01 --> 471.13
so yeah that's why I put that in a title

468.12 --> 475.66
because it really is like a new low it

471.13 --> 479.77
it reminds me of the the issue we

475.66 --> 485.05
originally had with trolls versus trolls

479.77 --> 488.53
was it no wait no Pete and Pete right

485.05 --> 492.79
that was the guy and they claimed that

488.53 --> 495.96999999999997
water turn is not yeah it's just a

492.79 --> 499.72
singular element and doesn't turn into

495.97 --> 501.94000000000005
hydrogen and oxygen that that thing now

499.72 --> 505.18
that was already pretty pretty bizarre

501.94 --> 508.02
and there are some interesting things to

505.18 --> 511.75
explore you know concerning

508.02 --> 514.29
transmutation effects which definitely

511.75 --> 517.06
kind of fall outside of the logic of

514.29 --> 522.3
basic chemistry and then those are

517.06 --> 525.81
issues to be explored right but yeah I

522.3 --> 530.02
yeah I I can definitely say that I've

525.81 --> 533.1099999999999
experienced with like on-the-spot

530.02 --> 537.34
chemistry that I yeah water definitely

533.11 --> 541.63
does not turn into water gas that is a

537.34 --> 546.9300000000001
single thing just it didn't work like

541.63 --> 552.37
that it was split up into different

546.93 --> 554.02
property type gases mm-hmm right so that

552.37 --> 556.15
was pretty ridiculous back in the day

554.02 --> 561.37
and we made a lot of fun of it well this

556.15 --> 563.7099999999999
is just worse it's like this isn't even

561.37 --> 566.83
experimental it's just a blatant error

563.71 --> 568.96
and they and they rolled with it when

566.83 --> 570.7900000000001
Sean Haugh can set that on his hangout

568.96 --> 573.3100000000001
and he didn't say it once he said it

570.79 --> 577.24
like three times and everybody just

573.31 --> 580.39
applauded him and cheered him on and

577.24 --> 584.38
said yeah yeah like that's just

580.39 --> 588.85
mind-blowing to me that's absolutely my

584.38 --> 591.4
like are they literally just drowning in

588.85 --> 594.19
this arrogance that they don't even

591.4 --> 596.4599999999999
notice what's just being said they're

594.19 --> 603.1800000000001
just assuming it's going to be all right

596.46 --> 606.1500000000001
it it's so sloppy so arrogant and it

603.18 --> 608.8399999999999
baffles me and it's like a new low in a

606.15 --> 611.6999999999999
way and that's why I also decided to

608.84 --> 616.2900000000001
yeah to give Sean Hawkins his own

611.7 --> 618.9300000000001
standard like rum basically Sean Hawkins

616.29 --> 623.43
the hidden level of stupidity that is so

618.93 --> 626.79
mind-blowing bad that he deserves to

623.43 --> 631.8599999999999
have a saying named after him just like

626.79 --> 635.37
rumpus has claimed the word rumpus well

631.86 --> 641.97
Sean Hawkins it's just so dumb like

635.37 --> 647.16
don't be a Sean Hawkins like don't like

641.97 --> 650.99
don't willingly lobotomize yourself like

647.16 --> 654.27
that you know so we'll see if it sticks

650.99 --> 656.58
and it also depends on how Sean Hawkins

654.27 --> 659.21
is gonna respond to all the situations

656.58 --> 659.21
just bizarre

660.53 --> 676.14
you see Sean like Owen sees Rogan Wow

665.37 --> 680.55
okay I don't know I think Joe Rogan is a

676.14 --> 684.33
lot smarter he's yeah he's full of flaws

680.55 --> 686.9399999999999
and like as I stated many times before

684.33 --> 689.1
especially intelligent people are not

686.94 --> 691.7600000000001
impervious to making incredibly stupid

689.1 --> 698.4
mistakes that can last a lifetime

691.76 --> 703.91
potentially so ya Joe Rogan but Sean is

698.4 --> 703.91
just and that's just the worst

711.85 --> 721.63
they lie oh hi Sean is an angry person

716.07 --> 723.9100000000001
well yeah I guess he does it does get

721.63 --> 727.2
angry very easily and he's always riled

723.91 --> 730.63
up I think that keeps him going

727.2 --> 731.95
you know I am personally kind of an

730.63 --> 736.78
angry person too

731.95 --> 740.32
from by nature it's it's but I can be

736.78 --> 742.06
very calm - so I kind of get that but

740.32 --> 743.9200000000001
that's not really the problem the

742.06 --> 746.5899999999999
problem is is that he's so freakin

743.92 --> 748.9599999999999
arrogant and so stupid and he's like he

746.59 --> 753.0
knows he's dumb but he thinks he just

748.96 --> 755.08
can't get away with bluffing everything

753.0 --> 760.84
he's just bluffing

755.08 --> 765.6700000000001
non-stop 60 year-old teenager Sean

760.84 --> 769.0
Hawkins yeah yeah kind of it does feel

765.67 --> 771.75
like that a bit I don't know how old he

769.0 --> 771.75
is my wave it

783.81 --> 790.17
Missouri bear Wow does he have a wife I

790.23 --> 795.85
get I could barely imagine if he did

793.99 --> 801.01
though that would be pretty miraculous

795.85 --> 803.89
and then it would make sense because if

801.01 --> 806.529
he'd had a wife then yeah and he'd have

803.89 --> 811.29
no choice but to be completely cocked by

806.529 --> 815.05
her or she'd leave because he's an idiot

811.29 --> 818.3199999999999
and yeah he doesn't deserve better like

815.05 --> 821.2299999999999
in the in the social world like that's

818.32 --> 823.69
just how things work it sucks in a way

821.23 --> 826.089
that's not fair but he's gonna be cocked

823.69 --> 828.7900000000001
if he has a wife and then oh yeah he

826.089 --> 831.5500000000001
damn well will have need to vent that

828.79 --> 834.399
off constantly it actually would make

831.55 --> 842.17
more sense that way but I can't imagine

834.399 --> 844.98
you would have a wife really but yeah

842.17 --> 844.9799999999999
who knows man

848.96 --> 857.4000000000001
the weirdest and most unlikely people

851.91 --> 859.77
sometimes get married it's usually it's

857.4 --> 862.56
just the women like I don't get I don't

859.77 --> 867.35
get it like why are you gonna marry such

862.56 --> 867.3499999999999
a guy but yeah anyway that's in it

878.66 --> 888.35
his family has no clue he's arguing

882.03 --> 888.35
these topics I don't know

890.21 --> 904.22
I maybe maybe Missouri Bera I think I

897.88 --> 908.529
don't really know I I would the problem

904.22 --> 911.0600000000001
is I would have to actually listen to

908.529 --> 914.99
[ __ ] like for a long time to actually

911.06 --> 916.5799999999999
study what he is saying to basically get

914.99 --> 918.38
a read on the [ __ ] what he's

916.58 --> 922.61
actually bullshitting about in order to

918.38 --> 927.41
extrapolate yeah how that works how will

922.61 --> 929.42
you like just framework him to really

927.41 --> 933.02
tell what his life in the back is really

929.42 --> 935.6899999999999
like I just don't want to I don't want

933.02 --> 937.97
to the guy is like an ant

935.69 --> 941.149
every time I'm somewhere that's why I

937.97 --> 944.36
blocked him in chats because he just

941.149 --> 947.089
constantly like a wasp just keeps on

944.36 --> 950.27
nagging and nagging and it's like I

947.089 --> 952.9590000000001
can't zoom in on that guy I just can't

950.27 --> 952.959
LA

954.51 --> 957.669
[Music]

960.14 --> 963.84
[Music]

980.52 --> 985.43
what the hell are you talking about a

983.13 --> 985.43
gym

1012.389 --> 1017.149
yeah hm that's really nice but when

1014.97 --> 1020.1890000000001
you're basically putting Owen Benjamin

1017.149 --> 1021.54
in such a sentence then yeah you're

1020.189 --> 1024.6299999999999
gonna get my attention

1021.54 --> 1027.529
I don't like people do that without

1024.63 --> 1031.199
actually having a good backup you know

1027.529 --> 1039.63
for it so that's why I said what are you

1031.199 --> 1041.8500000000001
talking about like is that some kind of

1039.63 --> 1045.179
show he did because yeah I'm Benjamin

1041.85 --> 1049.6789999999999
has been around for a long time and he's

1045.179 --> 1052.8600000000001
explained it he often shows things from

1049.679 --> 1055.47
the past he did and that says like yes

1052.86 --> 1059.24
see this part still holds up this is

1055.47 --> 1063.5
where I was at with my mind and this is

1059.24 --> 1067.049
what I didn't get yet so he kind of

1063.5 --> 1070.7
explains things about the past and like

1067.049 --> 1074.279
I think he's right on target with that

1070.7 --> 1079.049
so yeah we're just wondering what are

1074.279 --> 1084.33
you talking about this is supposed did

1079.049 --> 1086.96
you say night of freedom speech like

1084.33 --> 1086.96
when was that

1100.62 --> 1115.529
okay you're comfor dude oh my god dude

1113.009 --> 1119.07
hey gentlemen do you ever know that like

1115.529 --> 1122.97
Omer Benjamin has just been everywhere

1119.07 --> 1125.879
he's been on mainstream TV and [ __ ] it's

1122.97 --> 1132.71
been a high profile programs and [ __ ]

1125.879 --> 1135.7199999999998
so yeah he's reflected on that a lot

1132.71 --> 1138.409
maybe you should listen to that when he

1135.72 --> 1138.409
talks about it

1183.47 --> 1189.6100000000001
a gem stop it

1192.25 --> 1199.33
we get your train of thought I get your

1195.88 --> 1204.94
train of thought but I'm asking for our

1199.33 --> 1206.23
certain data and I've already I do your

1204.94 --> 1212.19
train of thought that you are putting

1206.23 --> 1215.26
down don't need time to breathe because

1212.19 --> 1218.23
been responding like two or three times

1215.26 --> 1220.65
like mid-sentence while you were putting

1218.23 --> 1220.65
that down

1230.44 --> 1235.99
[Music]

1233.09 --> 1235.99
oh dear

1252.95 --> 1259.73
no I will put it on you if you want to

1255.98 --> 1261.8600000000001
talk to Missouri and you don't want this

1259.73 --> 1264.38
to happen then don't do that in my chat

1261.86 --> 1267.1699999999998
you know what this chat is during the

1264.38 --> 1270.14
live show hm you know the history

1267.17 --> 1273.5600000000002
between us why are you just assuming you

1270.14 --> 1279.92
can have like this private chat in my

1273.56 --> 1284.2
life show and then just demand that I

1279.92 --> 1287.48
just don't make you actually back up

1284.2 --> 1288.53
some of the things you said that that's

1287.48 --> 1292.85
not how this works

1288.53 --> 1295.49
hm I'm getting the same vibe that I got

1292.85 --> 1299.05
from conspiracy cats yesterday because

1295.49 --> 1299.05
something very similar happened

1303.67 --> 1307.69
are you sure you can't chat with each

1305.8 --> 1312.01
other but if you're gonna do it in my

1307.69 --> 1315.04
chat then you can't rule out that I'm

1312.01 --> 1329.79
gonna get involved with it because this

1315.04 --> 1329.79
is my life show hm hey Sam Ahoskie

1367.78 --> 1380.1399999999999
he had a meeting by the way huh

1370.929 --> 1382.8300000000002
lots of people seeking star what I did

1380.14 --> 1382.8300000000002
is hello yet

1390.66 --> 1396.9
play the vin what Fred what did you do

1410.35 --> 1413.35
what

1417.23 --> 1420.519
oh nice Oh

1422.659 --> 1438.679
ah that's four hours long video but yes

1435.46 --> 1440.1200000000001
you did make a response to that you were

1438.679 --> 1443.8700000000001
one of the people that elaborately

1440.12 --> 1452.57
responded to that Pete vs. Pete video

1443.87 --> 1454.4189999999999
concerning the water situation yep I'm

1452.57 --> 1458.149
sorry but I'm not gonna play the video

1454.419 --> 1459.8890000000001
on my show because it's gonna end in 40

1458.149 --> 1465.37
minutes not in four hours

1459.889 --> 1471.8799999999999
oh I thought I should pop in the ink oh

1465.37 --> 1471.8799999999999
did you that didn't come through I think

1480.23 --> 1489.1100000000001
what no yeah that's weird it doesn't

1483.2 --> 1491.3300000000002
come through I can read it when I said

1489.11 --> 1495.86
copy link he did it didn't give it to me

1491.33 --> 1502.72
so I just have to manually copy it see

1495.86 --> 1502.7199999999998
that it works all right how long is it

1526.149 --> 1550.309
hope this works yeah all right how

1548.96 --> 1555.289
awesome would it be if we found out

1550.309 --> 1558.009
there was no H or O in water say I

1555.289 --> 1560.36
wouldn't be surprised

1558.009 --> 1563.629
okay this was the issue I had is that we

1560.36 --> 1565.9699999999998
are also open to this possibility but we

1563.629 --> 1580.309
weren't even given the chance to express

1565.97 --> 1582.95
that that was a yellow flame so what's

1580.309 --> 1584.99
yellow what's yellow Tom look shadows

1582.95 --> 1587.72
Ian based gasps he says so do you based

1584.99 --> 1589.159
gases will burn yellow okay for his

1587.72 --> 1592.0
proposed hydrogen they would expect it

1589.159 --> 1592.0
to burn blue

1594.31 --> 1597.9199999999998
you have never heard of purple leader

1596.12 --> 1598.84
that was anyone I was expecting Pluto

1597.92 --> 1602.03
which is about Arwen's

1598.84 --> 1610.1
Ocwen guest in chat that it would burn

1602.03 --> 1615.92
blue nice one atom we like a little bit

1610.1 --> 1625.82
of testing to be a [ __ ] hashtag

1615.92 --> 1628.6100000000001
tested what's that it I'm are still

1625.82 --> 1635.3
sharing screen the only thing I couldn't

1628.61 --> 1639.4099999999999
say in respond your to that guys is if

1635.3 --> 1641.93
it is some sodium base gas that's lovely

1639.41 --> 1645.7900000000002
that's like saying it's fair is unless

1641.93 --> 1648.38
you're gonna postulate something to

1645.79 --> 1656.32
rather reason that makes sense what's

1648.38 --> 1656.3200000000002
going off like I said into hmm all right

1657.34 --> 1667.59
oops oh come on all right

1676.24 --> 1683.1200000000001
come on right so yeah that was bit

1680.57 --> 1687.98
unexpected it it burned yellow

1683.12 --> 1690.32
apparently but I don't I wasn't

1687.98 --> 1693.1
yeah I'm not entirely informed like what

1690.32 --> 1693.1
you really did

1712.93 --> 1716.13
Yeah right

1716.83 --> 1725.56
took ages to make that hydrogen right so

1723.31 --> 1727.48
you mates but you specifically made

1725.56 --> 1730.84
hydrogen like through a chemical

1727.48 --> 1738.19
reaction I take it that creates hydrogen

1730.84 --> 1742.1799999999998
gas hmm so you did not like split up

1738.19 --> 1745.03
water itself in order to test that

1742.18 --> 1754.29
because that supposedly splits up in two

1745.03 --> 1754.29
types of gases so you did use water

1768.66 --> 1771.769
[Music]

1774.78 --> 1780.36
you have on each I know but there's like

1778.14 --> 1785.9
other things you can also do to make

1780.36 --> 1788.82
gases and what is it like yeah zinc with

1785.9 --> 1792.69
certain types of acid or something and

1788.82 --> 1795.27
that's this chemistry he's been a long

1792.69 --> 1799.2
time ago for me when I actually did like

1795.27 --> 1801.3899999999999
real things with that but yeah there's

1799.2 --> 1807.8400000000001
other ways than just splitting up water

1801.39 --> 1813.21
in order to make hydrogen as far as I

1807.84 --> 1823.1
know or as far as I remember it's been a

1813.21 --> 1823.1000000000001
while but okay hmm

1825.02 --> 1828.8899999999999
zinc copper

1829.13 --> 1831.64
okay

1842.52 --> 1846.29
the minium antacid

1858.49 --> 1869.44
all right yogi anyway look the idea that

1865.08 --> 1871.33
water vapor like when you boil water you

1869.44 --> 1876.28
know you get like the misty looking

1871.33 --> 1879.48
thing and then eventually like the air

1876.28 --> 1882.37
will just feel heavier and more moist

1879.48 --> 1885.85
that's not just water droplets hang

1882.37 --> 1889.09
around it may be at points like when you

1885.85 --> 1892.3
see the white the cloudy stuff then it's

1889.09 --> 1894.52
kind of water droplet II but it's almost

1892.3 --> 1897.94
like in an in-between stage where it's

1894.52 --> 1900.8799999999999
small enough not to be really become a

1897.94 --> 1902.95
droplet and fall down and it's being

1900.88 --> 1905.65
lifted by the heat at the same layer the

1902.95 --> 1909.04
hot air at the same time and it's kind

1905.65 --> 1915.21
of like in the midway point of what is

1909.04 --> 1920.05
it evaporating again into pure gas form

1915.21 --> 1922.78
but in general the majority will simply

1920.05 --> 1926.1399999999999
turn into that absolutely transparent

1922.78 --> 1928.69
gas and make the air heavier and then

1926.14 --> 1930.42
for example if the if the room in which

1928.69 --> 1934.74
that happens cools down significantly

1930.42 --> 1937.66
then what typically happens is that the

1934.74 --> 1940.33
the evaporated water will start to

1937.66 --> 1942.7900000000002
condense and then yeah moist will start

1940.33 --> 1946.26
to set on the walls and all that this is

1942.79 --> 1950.26
typically what happens in the morning

1946.26 --> 1952.179
when there was like a warm night and

1950.26 --> 1955.3
then it cools off in the morning and

1952.179 --> 1959.16
that's how do then appears everywhere

1955.3 --> 1959.1599999999999
it's like the settled water vapor

1959.37 --> 1968.6789999999999
because of the cold it's what is it the

1964.14 --> 1970.39
it's liquification a threshold point

1968.679 --> 1973.3600000000001
will lower because of the lower

1970.39 --> 1976.48
temperature and then it will yeah start

1973.36 --> 1979.4499999999998
to form droplets again when touching

1976.48 --> 1980.95
that specific type of cold a surface

1979.45 --> 1983.28
with that type of cold that's how it

1980.95 --> 1983.28
works

1984.19 --> 1989.1200000000001
and it needs a surface you know it needs

1986.84 --> 1991.37
the surface in order to become a droplet

1989.12 --> 1996.77
again in order to become liquid again

1991.37 --> 1999.4699999999998
this is also the reason why yeah it's

1996.77 --> 2003.51
not just constantly raining because it

1999.47 --> 2009.28
needs certain particulates in order to

2003.51 --> 2011.95
liquefy again so it's it requires dust

2009.28 --> 2018.059
to be around in order to even be able to

2011.95 --> 2018.059
form into water and rain again or hail

2029.159 --> 2036.3990000000001
right so there's a lot to water you know

2032.289 --> 2038.259
it's like a thing of its own there's so

2036.399 --> 2040.6
many things that happen with water and

2038.259 --> 2042.6100000000001
processes that it needs water your false

2040.6 --> 2047.4699999999998
freaking everything everything

2042.61 --> 2049.0
concerning life at least and there's

2047.47 --> 2051.69
just so many different states and

2049.0 --> 2057.159
effects and things and unique properties

2051.69 --> 2062.23
you know and yeah I pride myself to know

2057.159 --> 2065.23
quite a lot about it like I collect

2062.23 --> 2069.369
water knowledge he which is kind of

2065.23 --> 2071.26
funny because one of the things among

2069.369 --> 2074.29
that knowledge is that water is actually

2071.26 --> 2079.7200000000003
able to carry knowledge is able to carry

2074.29 --> 2090.48
information it's very interesting how

2079.72 --> 2090.48
that works yeah funny isn't it

2090.969 --> 2094.059
[Music]

2096.199 --> 2099.369
[Music]

2113.02 --> 2118.119
all right

2115.24 --> 2119.95
it's funny how that works you know in in

2118.119 --> 2123.19
ways I think that memory is kind of

2119.95 --> 2125.0499999999997
secondary to frequency because it's very

2123.19 --> 2126.43
typical that certain types of memories

2125.05 --> 2128.11
are triggered in certain types of

2126.43 --> 2129.73
situations which correlate with a

2128.11 --> 2134.11
frequency that you're going through an

2129.73 --> 2135.76
atmosphere feelings energies of

2134.11 --> 2139.36
presences of other people's and

2135.76 --> 2147.369
scenarios the effects on top of that and

2139.36 --> 2150.1
that influences like your memory and but

2147.369 --> 2153.94
it also influences water-proof ibly like

2150.1 --> 2156.58
you can like reflect an idea or a

2153.94 --> 2158.53
feeling on water and that will influence

2156.58 --> 2163.74
the way it crystallizes when you freeze

2158.53 --> 2169.119
it very distinctly it's unique

2163.74 --> 2171.7
that's the studies of dr. Emoto so

2169.119 --> 2174.82
figure that out brandy the pseudo

2171.7 --> 2178.6
scientists but yet he did reveal that

2174.82 --> 2181.4500000000003
unique property of water and it's very

2178.6 --> 2184.21
well tested even though it basically

2181.45 --> 2189.1
deals with information and that's why

2184.21 --> 2193.21
it's yeah that's the problem it's like a

2189.1 --> 2196.3199999999997
proof of information and yeah how do you

2193.21 --> 2196.32
scientifically prove that

2198.33 --> 2203.1
I don't know if he ever completed that

2200.97 --> 2205.47
or if he's just being slandered

2203.1 --> 2208.62
and he actually is a full-on scientist

2205.47 --> 2210.5099999999998
but I remember him being called the

2208.62 --> 2213.9
pseudo scientist yet still having a

2210.51 --> 2216.3900000000003
having inspired a lot of people with the

2213.9 --> 2221.79
visuals like the results of his tests

2216.39 --> 2224.54
and I do respect him for that for

2221.79 --> 2224.54
revealing that

2232.21 --> 2238.88
right buttwater you could consider that

2235.369 --> 2240.77
water is like a frequency it adapts to a

2238.88 --> 2245.57
frequency and then it holds that

2240.77 --> 2250.39
frequency and that is kind of like what

2245.57 --> 2255.4700000000003
memory is or rather the primary effect

2250.39 --> 2258.5299999999997
the atmosphere memory on which the

2255.47 --> 2261.77
thoughts correlating with that

2258.53 --> 2264.23
atmosphere manifest in that specific way

2261.77 --> 2267.44
it's like the way the crystal forms of

2264.23 --> 2270.05
the memory so you yeah you can damn well

2267.44 --> 2274.79
correlate that with the base functions

2270.05 --> 2278.3590000000004
of water itself it's fascinating but it

2274.79 --> 2280.13
is all about information has to do more

2278.359 --> 2285.339
with like the consciousness and

2280.13 --> 2288.349
information than like just basic

2285.339 --> 2293.18
chemical properties it it doesn't really

2288.349 --> 2295.01
do that it's only in reflection to

2293.18 --> 2296.66
whatever energy is going around a

2295.01 --> 2297.71
special type of energy going around in

2296.66 --> 2300.3489999999997
the atmosphere like if there's

2297.71 --> 2302.75
electrical fields that are very good and

2300.349 --> 2305.7200000000003
pure it'll affect the water and how it

2302.75 --> 2308.089
crystallizes if there's people that have

2305.72 --> 2310.16
very positive influence and like care

2308.089 --> 2312.589
for the water as if it were like an

2310.16 --> 2317.18
entity it will crystallize very

2312.589 --> 2324.52
beautifully but it's always in

2317.18 --> 2326.96
reflection to something else there's no

2324.52 --> 2329.349
interference no and then there's no

2326.96 --> 2329.349
change

2333.82 --> 2341.42
water carries emotions what can can be

2338.18 --> 2344.41
it can associate a frequency it carries

2341.42 --> 2347.9300000000003
a frequency an energy frequency

2344.41 --> 2352.1
atmosphere has to do with the

2347.93 --> 2355.99
consciousness and yeah certain type of

2352.1 --> 2360.74
frequencies can arouse emotions

2355.99 --> 2365.18
depending on where the person's act this

2360.74 --> 2367.0699999999997
is kind of like how music works - it

2365.18 --> 2370.25
just depends on where the individual

2367.07 --> 2373.1800000000003
consciousness is at what they will pick

2370.25 --> 2379.84
up on from the frequency that is

2373.18 --> 2379.8399999999997
contained in the water spawning memories

2390.64 --> 2395.4
a few Watchers more emotional haha

2405.59 --> 2410.9
I don't know who that one guy I don't

2407.69 --> 2414.83
know if he's tested it on heavy water he

2410.9 --> 2421.1600000000003
might actually have I don't know heavy

2414.83 --> 2423.62
water is weird water gets emotional when

2421.16 --> 2431.39
you drink it okay

2423.62 --> 2433.67
Isis unveil that's that's weird

2431.39 --> 2437.81
because I think that water itself

2433.67 --> 2441.28
doesn't really have emotions but it will

2437.81 --> 2445.75
resonate in a certain way that people

2441.28 --> 2448.94
typically then respond to with emotions

2445.75 --> 2450.95
so the emotions and the responses and

2448.94 --> 2456.83
even like the structural memories

2450.95 --> 2458.4199999999996
associated reflect to a frequency and

2456.83 --> 2461.99
that frequency is the thing that's

2458.42 --> 2465.94
copied not literal emotion itself

2461.99 --> 2465.9399999999996
there's no emotion in the water

2474.76 --> 2479.0800000000004
now look if you're gonna go by that

2477.67 --> 2481.84
standard then you're literally

2479.08 --> 2483.13
attributing like consciousness and all

2481.84 --> 2488.17
that to water itself

2483.13 --> 2490.63
look you could do that because yeah if

2488.17 --> 2493.48
you model it out like that whoo yeah

2490.63 --> 2497.19
yeah it kind of works but as I said

2493.48 --> 2499.45
before it it it's kind of overlooking a

2497.19 --> 2501.91
mechanism that's in between because it's

2499.45 --> 2505.72
it's not literally having conscious it's

2501.91 --> 2508.75
not literally memory it's a frequency it

2505.72 --> 2512.89
reveals more about the mysterious nature

2508.75 --> 2515.85
of our consciousness and how it responds

2512.89 --> 2515.85
to frequencies

2520.29 --> 2529.2
[Music]

2521.89 --> 2537.72
oh cool you got a good figure there

2529.2 --> 2542.4399999999996
let's check it out ah monsieur de moto

2537.72 --> 2544.2599999999998
awesome yeah that's cool now I'll show

2542.44 --> 2549.87
that good all times

2544.26 --> 2553.92
what's the music in that is it any good

2549.87 --> 2559.0499999999997
[Music]

2553.92 --> 2559.05
okay I'll just show it

2564.339 --> 2569.619
all right so this is what I was talking

2567.549 --> 2576.19
about with dr. Emoto and his water

2569.619 --> 2580.6800000000003
crystal experiments or tests silly music

2576.19 --> 2580.68
and these are you had the results and

2581.759 --> 2588.039
correlating word and now you have to wow

2585.549 --> 2594.43
the extra animation is not being helpful

2588.039 --> 2599.8900000000003
at all but the the effect that you're

2594.43 --> 2604.749
basically seeing the crystal is a result

2599.89 --> 2607.569
of people being there because you could

2604.749 --> 2612.91
imagine that it if if it was all just

2607.569 --> 2615.609
robots prefab like putting stickers on

2612.91 --> 2617.319
files of water and like robot arm

2615.609 --> 2619.69
automatically putting it in the freezer

2617.319 --> 2621.849
and all that there probably would be not

2619.69 --> 2626.619
a lot of difference no it's because

2621.849 --> 2631.9300000000003
people put the stickers on there and the

2626.619 --> 2634.92
people are like the our carriers of

2631.93 --> 2637.5989999999997
water and frequencies and responding and

2634.92 --> 2641.289
so it really matters what kind of

2637.599 --> 2644.619
stickers were put on there in order to

2641.289 --> 2648.849
yeah cause the effect it has to do with

2644.619 --> 2652.42
information and just a sticker with a

2648.849 --> 2654.4
word isn't information until it is

2652.42 --> 2657.64
reflected upon the consciousness and

2654.4 --> 2661.2690000000002
then it really is information then it

2657.64 --> 2662.92
has a meaning and it comes forth from

2661.269 --> 2664.9599999999996
the meaning their resonance in the

2662.92 --> 2670.9900000000002
frequency the response comes forth from

2664.96 --> 2677.21
the meaning that's how I see it

2670.99 --> 2680.27
the cosmos see yeah there's a lot of

2677.21 --> 2682.79
people that love the word cosmos dreamy

2680.27 --> 2683.89
and Spacey and so there's no problem

2682.79 --> 2688.93
with that

2683.89 --> 2688.93
look at that it's not just amazing

2691.29 --> 2694.44
[Music]

2700.34 --> 2709.03
that's your River in Japan dr. emoto's

2706.49 --> 2709.0299999999997
Japanese

2717.71 --> 2724.48
yep I can atone to that it's exactly how

2722.24 --> 2724.4799999999996
that feels

2725.62 --> 2732.56
that's just amazing that it looks like a

2728.98 --> 2735.64
like a flower petal Japanese folk music

2732.56 --> 2735.64
that's just amazing

2753.36 --> 2756.53
[Music]

2759.58 --> 2762.73
[Music]

2786.49 --> 2792.58
yeah that just keeps on going

2789.609 --> 2795.7
oh yeah we're almost through it it isn't

2792.58 --> 2803.38
that just standing here look six sided

2795.7 --> 2808.66
crystal like that it's just yeah it's

2803.38 --> 2813.6400000000003
Nathan Oakley water crystals we should

2808.66 --> 2815.5299999999997
review like put a recording of when

2813.64 --> 2818.65
Nathan Oakley like really starts to

2815.53 --> 2820.3900000000003
trash a baller and then subject that to

2818.65 --> 2829.44
watch or I'll freeze it and see what

2820.39 --> 2832.06
it'll look like you stupid fun easy I

2829.44 --> 2835.27
want to see what if water crystal looks

2832.06 --> 2851.41
like in response to you stupid funding

2835.27 --> 2860.44
zealots don't you guys want to know or

2851.41 --> 2862.359
just o rumpus look what I really wanted

2860.44 --> 2866.83
to see what a rumpus water crystal looks

2862.359 --> 2869.38
like I bet it'll have a different type

2866.83 --> 2872.7599999999998
of crystallization when I do it and when

2869.38 --> 2872.76
for example Nathan knows it

2873.57 --> 2877.71
Sean Hawkins our God

2884.64 --> 2895.5
no bet I wonder if you yeah if that word

2891.51 --> 2898.92
if it would literally like have a ball

2895.5 --> 2903.06
looking crystal and then just a bunch of

2898.92 --> 2906.71
goo or something maybe like if like like

2903.06 --> 2906.71
it's gonna surprise you I bet

2913.35 --> 2916.46
[Music]

2919.04 --> 2925.19
right and the funny thing is is that

2922.01 --> 2928.4900000000002
technically you yeah it's not that

2925.19 --> 2931.67
incredibly difficult now he has utilized

2928.49 --> 2933.29
very careful laboratory conditions with

2931.67 --> 2937.96
the temperature and the methodologies

2933.29 --> 2940.97
and all that but technically you could

2937.96 --> 2943.85
do something like this for yourself with

2940.97 --> 2948.0099999999998
basically a freezer and if you yeah you

2943.85 --> 2948.0099999999998
have to look into like the process

2948.34 --> 2957.53
because yeah just a random ice crystal

2951.55 --> 2960.3500000000004
you know look yeah if you can still find

2957.53 --> 2962.3900000000003
it look him up and just see what exactly

2960.35 --> 2968.42
he did how he did it because he does

2962.39 --> 2969.92
describe it oh yeah when I read it but

2968.42 --> 2973.46
that's a while ago I don't know if it's

2969.92 --> 2977.27
still just publicly out there I'll bet

2973.46 --> 2980.44
he has books with it that describe

2977.27 --> 2980.44
exactly everything

2981.84 --> 2985.039
[Music]

2988.88 --> 2995.48
okay I'm a koala okay so you tried so

2991.65 --> 2995.48
your brother tried something like that

3001.71 --> 3009.569
anyway yeah it's kind of funny isn't it

3005.54 --> 3013.079
so yeah doing this like checking water

3009.569 --> 3015.359
crystals and and testing the frequency

3013.079 --> 3019.1400000000003
effect and feelings and words and

3015.359 --> 3020.94
associations with water freezing it's

3019.14 --> 3022.859
kind of it you could it's almost like a

3020.94 --> 3026.55
hobby thing it's really an interesting

3022.859 --> 3032.569
test that a lot of people can do as long

3026.55 --> 3036.2400000000002
as you have a proper freezer and it will

3032.569 --> 3038.579
it might very well surprise you just to

3036.24 --> 3041.4599999999996
see it happen especially when you do it

3038.579 --> 3046.319
because it's gonna be in a way

3041.46 --> 3049.619
reflecting to you also so it may like

3046.319 --> 3051.99
literally just freezing water like that

3049.619 --> 3054.44
may reveal something about yourself how

3051.99 --> 3054.4399999999996
about that

3072.31 --> 3077.6
I've got this disingenuous reality deny

3075.71 --> 3080.41
of questionable character willing to

3077.6 --> 3083.6
present beliefs as facts and

3080.41 --> 3085.22
misrepresent truth often uses file and

3083.6 --> 3092.6
derogatory language to marginalize

3085.22 --> 3095.6899999999996
others yeah although a very important

3092.6 --> 3099.11
part is just red herring debating

3095.69 --> 3103.1
straight like the most sizeable or I

3099.11 --> 3106.34
guess the most durable ballers really

3103.1 --> 3108.56
utilize just added giant amount of

3106.34 --> 3110.96
machinations that are out there there is

3108.56 --> 3116.24
always some kind of story you can jump

3110.96 --> 3121.64
to like the red herring options in in

3116.24 --> 3124.2999999999997
being a baller is is fast so I almost

3121.64 --> 3127.31
feel feel like you left that part out

3124.3 --> 3129.8900000000003
but that's a good representation that's

3127.31 --> 3132.22
a good description there IRA Nephi thank

3129.89 --> 3132.22
you for that

3147.5 --> 3154.19
what seeking star order and what

3150.67 --> 3156.88
Minerals capable of transmutation what

3154.19 --> 3156.88
are you talking about

3168.83 --> 3177.79
all righty cab well often you know

3174.53 --> 3177.7900000000004
doesn't mean always

3185.31 --> 3193.95
you know it's look he have a look at it

3189.87 --> 3196.1099999999997
like this when I hang around with

3193.95 --> 3198.3599999999997
ballers and they're talking about like

3196.11 --> 3200.3700000000003
really stupid flat earthers because they

3198.36 --> 3202.7400000000002
do exist it's just that we don't really

3200.37 --> 3204.24
on our site don't really remember them a

3202.74 --> 3207.6299999999997
lot unless they really get in

3204.24 --> 3210.12
everybody's way you know and if you then

3207.63 --> 3212.73
refer to them we'll be saying like wait

3210.12 --> 3221.99
but that's not us

3212.73 --> 3225.36
you know so yeah both our sites do this

3221.99 --> 3227.64
because yeah the good ballers are always

3225.36 --> 3230.82
kind of gonna be unfortunately in the

3227.64 --> 3233.1
shadow of the stupid and most loud noisy

3230.82 --> 3235.44
annoying ballers that's how the world

3233.1 --> 3240.72
that works with everyone it's an

3235.44 --> 3243.48
unfortunately side reality of doing

3240.72 --> 3246.2
things like the noisy more annoying

3243.48 --> 3252.26
person is gonna draw more attention

3246.2 --> 3258.39
unfortunately but they will eventually

3252.26 --> 3260.3700000000003
more and more ejected over time so but

3258.39 --> 3262.89
at this point you know it's been kind of

3260.37 --> 3266.46
like five years now and there are still

3262.89 --> 3269.4
very distinct division in camps between

3266.46 --> 3272.84
like all ballers including normies that

3269.4 --> 3276.15
kind of go with ballers or whatever and

3272.84 --> 3279.27
num ballers

3276.15 --> 3281.88
the flat earthers and they they kind of

3279.27 --> 3284.67
are just agreeing on it's not a ball and

3281.88 --> 3286.05
they like okay okay we're gonna work

3284.67 --> 3288.06
together even though I think you're

3286.05 --> 3290.73
stupid about this and know you might be

3288.06 --> 3292.86
shoe and and the other ones like but

3290.73 --> 3296.07
you're just yourself Anya and this is

3292.86 --> 3299.1
getting annoying but as long as you're

3296.07 --> 3304.44
against the ball I'll just not get in

3299.1 --> 3308.36
your hair or something you know there's

3304.44 --> 3311.58
so many different types of flat earthers

3308.36 --> 3315.69
but yeah there's still plenty of leather

3311.58 --> 3317.0499999999997
there's at least that are all growing in

3315.69 --> 3321.4
what they do

3317.05 --> 3323.82
they're becoming better and it's good to

3321.4 --> 3323.82
see that

3327.36 --> 3331.07
and so am i by the way

3340.82 --> 3343.6600000000003
that's out

3358.84 --> 3365.78
okay Jeffrey bill that's fascinating I

3364.01 --> 3369.26
don't know why you had to put that there

3365.78 --> 3371.2900000000004
twice the will watch your reference for

3369.26 --> 3371.2900000000004
that

3393.57 --> 3401.46
I am Sean Hawkins has a lot of fantasies

3398.76 --> 3403.59
about a lot of flat earthers just going

3401.46 --> 3406.53
nutso that's his imagination although it

3403.59 --> 3408.3900000000003
just takes these people us we're

3406.53 --> 3410.4900000000002
crushing it we're actually building

3408.39 --> 3412.5899999999997
arguments we're proceeding we're getting

3410.49 --> 3415.3799999999997
better and he's just all day long in his

3412.59 --> 3419.07
imagination just using these puppets of

3415.38 --> 3420.9
us and then in his mind making us do the

3419.07 --> 3423.02
crazy things that he wants us to do

3420.9 --> 3425.85
that's what he does

3423.02 --> 3428.13
this is the own virtual puppet realm

3425.85 --> 3430.46
where he's the secret king he's in

3428.13 --> 3430.46
control

3430.55 --> 3434.1200000000003
it's ridiculous

3439.22 --> 3453.74
alright see later getting sick I'm gonna

3442.52 --> 3456.91
run out the show soon anyway no follow

3453.74 --> 3456.91
up on that Jeffrey bill

3477.65 --> 3484.039
ooh that's a good one iron Fe that's a

3480.769 --> 3486.89
really good one baller red-herring globe

3484.039 --> 3489.7990000000004
cultist persistent denial misdirection

3486.89 --> 3492.23
contradiction and lying attempts to

3489.799 --> 3497.499
destabilize and D legitimize when no

3492.23 --> 3506.21
counter facts are available yeah that's

3497.499 --> 3509.45
excellent yeah I think that with that

3506.21 --> 3512.9900000000002
I'm gonna run out to show maybe little

3509.45 --> 3519.999
early yeah but I started a little early

3512.99 --> 3519.999
to write right now two more minutes

3524.92 --> 3529.98
alright good servin if you like him

3527.02 --> 3529.98
that's that's fine

3536.96 --> 3542.21
I've had a bit of a history with him he

3540.2 --> 3545.1189999999997
was getting like back in the day when I

3542.21 --> 3550.04
was still doing Flat Earth talks like he

3545.119 --> 3552.17
was like calling me like a Jew and all

3550.04 --> 3562.15
that it was we and the other hand he

3552.17 --> 3565.099
calls a lot of people that it's like

3562.15 --> 3568.07
yeah I could never really get along with

3565.099 --> 3571.82
that guy and like the way he is and

3568.07 --> 3575.3300000000004
speaks and all that it just I don't know

3571.82 --> 3580.9700000000003
I can I have a certain opinion about

3575.33 --> 3583.04
that so I'm just gonna stay out of the

3580.97 --> 3586.1899999999996
way you know let him do what he does you

3583.04 --> 3587.93
know he has some really good videos like

3586.19 --> 3590.7200000000003
videos where he's just speaking and

3587.93 --> 3595.7599999999998
giving a list of arguments and yeah most

3590.72 --> 3600.83
of them are very decent and he's good at

3595.76 --> 3605.1800000000003
that but as a person I don't know man

3600.83 --> 3608.5099999999998
like I don't really trust him but that's

3605.18 --> 3611.24
like a just his person that not even

3608.51 --> 3613.3390000000004
like oh he is the agent that kind of I

3611.24 --> 3617.1699999999996
don't trust him no it's just that a him

3613.339 --> 3617.17
as a person I don't really trust him

3627.36 --> 3634.44
but yeah he's been at it for a long time

3630.29 --> 3637.46
done a lot of work was off the first

3634.44 --> 3637.46
wave definitely

3641.68 --> 3649.93
right Missouri bear and and you you

3647.559 --> 3652.42
gotta see it like this as well like he

3649.93 --> 3657.069
literally has so many people surrounding

3652.42 --> 3662.109
him that just attack people that say bad

3657.069 --> 3665.859
things about him like if you allow that

3662.109 --> 3668.109
if you allow followers to do that that

3665.859 --> 3671.8289999999997
is not moral that's not morally right

3668.109 --> 3676.18
then you are like okay with being a cult

3671.829 --> 3683.319
leader if you allow or even encourage

3676.18 --> 3686.1699999999996
followers to do that kind of thing like

3683.319 --> 3688.93
I don't allow people to do that the cult

3686.17 --> 3693.609
of Dubey no that's where the whole stuff

3688.93 --> 3695.589
on yay thing came from originally but

3693.609 --> 3700.799
yeah it has more to do with just the
