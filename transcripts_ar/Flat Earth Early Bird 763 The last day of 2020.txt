not bad

94.96 --> 103.52
it's been kind of fair

99.28 --> 106.64
it's a bit misty but not too bad

103.52 --> 109.03999999999999
you can still see the sun going through

106.64 --> 114.56
the clouds there

109.04 --> 115.119
or at least the sunlight but at least

114.56 --> 117.759
it's not

115.119 --> 120.56
rainy or anything so that's nice hope it

117.759 --> 120.56
stays that way

122.88 --> 130.16
all right it's not cold

126.24 --> 130.16
so yeah promises to be

130.879 --> 135.92
a pleasant new year's eve

138.64 --> 146.72
so let's see who's in chat

141.76 --> 146.72
all right yeah turret 306 was first

148.4 --> 155.28
coming to two bubble gum and kick ass

152.239 --> 157.12
all right manny aviles who's not exactly

155.28 --> 162.48
first but welcome anyway

157.12 --> 162.48000000000002
and here we go again yeah good to see

168.84 --> 171.84
you

172.56 --> 185.519
ah you're watching they live yeah it's a

174.48 --> 188.72
good one

185.519 --> 192.48000000000002
right so

188.72 --> 192.48
yesterday was quite eventful

193.04 --> 200.239
yeah like rumpus came on again

196.4 --> 202.64000000000001
in the after show was it in the after

200.239 --> 204.64000000000001
show was it even before the after show i

202.64 --> 206.879
don't remember exactly but

204.64 --> 209.92
that was very amusing and he was in a

206.879 --> 209.92
full romper's mode

210.48 --> 217.84
and yeah he made some last

214.48 --> 221.04
last-minute concessions like he tried to

217.84 --> 223.12
take the crown again

221.04 --> 224.319
and this time he went as far as to claim

223.12 --> 228.159
that

224.319 --> 231.83999999999997
gravity is not strong enough to keep

228.159 --> 235.04
yeah the gas stuck to the ball basically

231.84 --> 238.08
i might be transcribing a little but

235.04 --> 238.56
that was pretty much what he said and he

238.08 --> 241.92000000000002
even

238.56 --> 245.2
confirmed that like twice

241.92 --> 248.23899999999998
after inquiring so that was

245.2 --> 251.11999999999998
just like what why why are you doing

248.239 --> 251.12
that rhombus

252.56 --> 257.519
he wants to make the top list of silly

255.84 --> 261.919
baller remarks

257.519 --> 264.24
i guess and yeah he definitely takes the

261.919 --> 264.24
cake

264.32 --> 267.759
on average and i find him the most

266.24 --> 270.8
amusing as a baller too

267.759 --> 272.72
so and the most tenacious

270.8 --> 276.24
he's still at it you know most of the

272.72 --> 278.40000000000003
other ballers supposed specialists

276.24 --> 280.16
they've they don't even come on anymore

278.4 --> 283.84
they've all retracted

280.16 --> 283.84000000000003
rampa still gets on

285.919 --> 288.24
right

290.8 --> 297.84000000000003
and yeah owen benjamin was also alive

293.04 --> 297.84000000000003
again yesterday that was pretty good

299.36 --> 303.44
i made a note something that i said i

301.84 --> 307.19899999999996
thought it was pretty

303.44 --> 310.4
sensible anti-government propaganda is a

307.199 --> 315.28000000000003
grabbler scheme

310.4 --> 319.919
like talk about oversimplification but

315.28 --> 324.479
in a way justified they always tried it

319.919 --> 326.4
like if anti-government is extremely

324.479 --> 329.12
popularized just look at

326.4 --> 331.039
like why and then look at what

329.12 --> 333.039
government really is and owen benjamin

331.039 --> 334.479
like put down a really sensible case for

333.039 --> 336.96
that yesterday

334.479 --> 338.639
like that a lot of government institutes

336.96 --> 342.63899999999995
basically do

338.639 --> 342.639
have to abide by the constitution

343.039 --> 349.28
like that's how they are set up

346.24 --> 352.40000000000003
in comparison to corporations

349.28 --> 352.79999999999995
and mega corporations which don't have

352.4 --> 355.75899999999996
that

352.8 --> 358.0
constitution they can basically do

355.759 --> 361.52000000000004
whatever they want it's much more of a

358.0 --> 364.639
monarchical setup with the owner

361.52 --> 366.96
and that yeah and that's so that

364.639 --> 368.96000000000004
anti-government propaganda is basically

366.96 --> 372.79999999999995
to manipulate everybody to hate

368.96 --> 372.79999999999995
government and everything associated

373.44 --> 377.52
basically yeah what's the alternative

375.44 --> 379.44
left for the corporations to take over

377.52 --> 384.56
and then you lose all the rights

379.44 --> 384.56
or yeah practically because you don't

384.72 --> 394.0
yeah it's it was a really

390.24 --> 397.199
well laid down overview

394.0 --> 399.68
and yeah i agree and it worries me too

397.199 --> 401.12
i guess in in direct way i tried to

399.68 --> 404.88
address that

401.12 --> 404.88
in the last week or so

406.84 --> 412.96
huh

409.84 --> 414.96
and i don't know it's kind of something

412.96 --> 418.0
that i felt for a long time like

414.96 --> 421.68
it's it's no use it's just squirting

418.0 --> 424.8
all this anti-government stuff in a way

421.68 --> 427.44
and even like the anarchists

424.8 --> 429.36
like even though they have a case

427.44 --> 432.479
technically

429.36 --> 433.91900000000004
it's not very practical in the face of a

432.479 --> 437.84
landscape where there's mega

433.919 --> 437.84
corporations that are even worse

441.199 --> 453.91900000000004
hey amanda young rob h by the way

450.4 --> 453.919
ah lots of chat

459.52 --> 465.84
oh god daddy yeah that guy is just

471.039 --> 476.71999999999997
we already have a legend in him but

473.84 --> 479.52
daddy is just the newcomer and

476.72 --> 481.59900000000005
he wants to be a rumpus too and he's

479.52 --> 486.479
getting there

481.599 --> 491.68
but he was very dumb very uninformed

486.479 --> 495.199
but at least he he has he wants to

491.68 --> 498.40000000000003
he's not just boring and droning

495.199 --> 499.36
but yeah very stupid on the flat earth

498.4 --> 501.52
debates

499.36 --> 507.84000000000003
in the last two days i wonder if he'll

501.52 --> 507.84
try to come back today

514.77 --> 517.909
[Music]

518.839 --> 522.479
hmm

520.159 --> 524.08
anyway i'm gonna have a busy day today

522.479 --> 526.0
so i might not even be

524.08 --> 528.32
fully present on the flat earth debates

526.0 --> 528.32
today

528.64 --> 532.16
because i have to go out for some

530.32 --> 533.7600000000001
groceries and have to do it in time

532.16 --> 537.12
because i think a lot of stores are

533.76 --> 537.12
closing pretty early

537.92 --> 540.88
compared to normal

542.16 --> 546.48
i want to see if i can get some cheap

544.16 --> 549.519
ass fireworks even

546.48 --> 550.16
just just a little because i yeah i

549.519 --> 552.0
don't have

550.16 --> 553.68
anything left i think i think i've

552.0 --> 555.839
burned through it all

553.68 --> 557.4399999999999
and and that was all just remnants from

555.839 --> 559.7600000000001
years ago

557.44 --> 560.6400000000001
but i still want something i don't know

559.76 --> 563.68
some

560.64 --> 565.12
really basic stuff nothing fancy or

563.68 --> 568.2399999999999
expensive

565.12 --> 568.24
just to have something

570.64 --> 575.04
and uh yeah and groceries and stocking

574.0 --> 579.36
up because the

575.04 --> 579.36
the first of january everything's closed

582.959 --> 591.8389999999999
right so i have to do all that

592.48 --> 598.24
it reminds me of wiggles that's some

595.76 --> 598.24
time ago

602.839 --> 606.6400000000001
wiggles

604.16 --> 609.1999999999999
for me it's sometimes it's even

606.64 --> 612.24
difficult to keep

609.2 --> 614.5600000000001
the ballers apart some of them because

612.24 --> 617.12
their voices are very similar

614.56 --> 619.5999999999999
and their arguments often become very

617.12 --> 622.399
similar

619.6 --> 623.76
and i never get to see their faces or

622.399 --> 626.24
anything

623.76 --> 627.4399999999999
so yeah sometimes i think like oh

626.24 --> 630.88
there's this new baller

627.44 --> 632.5600000000001
oh he's just the same guy pretending to

630.88 --> 635.2
be new again

632.56 --> 636.4799999999999
i've had that issue because some yeah

635.2 --> 640.0
some of their voices are just

636.48 --> 640.9590000000001
so alike maybe it's just me maybe it is

640.0 --> 644.72
because

640.959 --> 646.56
english isn't my base language

644.72 --> 648.48
that i just have just this little bit

646.56 --> 650.959
more trouble

648.48 --> 652.32
keeping it apart i'm not sure maybe

650.959 --> 654.88
other people have had these

652.32 --> 657.6800000000001
issues as well just some of these baller

654.88 --> 657.68
voices are so

658.839 --> 661.839
similar

666.0 --> 669.44
but yeah a lot of the same types

667.92 --> 671.279
apparently do pop up

669.44 --> 675.839
and start doing the same sort of thing

671.279 --> 675.8389999999999
it's pretty remarkable

676.24 --> 680.0
there was a guy vacuum

682.32 --> 689.839
a man beardella

697.04 --> 701.1999999999999
it's just nathan saying his name well

698.959 --> 704.2399999999999
that's part of the trolling scheme

701.2 --> 708.0
look all these troll squirters are

704.24 --> 708.0
making up names specifically

708.32 --> 715.2
because they are trying to yeah

712.16 --> 716.7199999999999
make nathan say those names in relation

715.2 --> 718.5600000000001
to his grilling

716.72 --> 720.399
and they think that's funny i think

718.56 --> 722.88
that's true there's really like this

720.399 --> 722.88
secret

724.399 --> 728.56
troll scheme going on with that they've

727.2 --> 729.6
been trying with me as well you know

728.56 --> 732.3199999999999
that's why i usually

729.6 --> 732.8000000000001
if yeah if i really dislike a name of

732.32 --> 736.1600000000001
some

732.8 --> 740.079
somebody in chat or whatever i will

736.16 --> 740.079
just delete i will remove them

741.68 --> 749.8389999999999
because usually they just do that

745.36 --> 749.839
because they want to hear you say that

751.6 --> 756.8000000000001
it's really infantile like that it's

756.839 --> 761.6800000000001
annoying

759.68 --> 762.959
and i love it because nathan wins well

761.68 --> 764.6389999999999
yeah well nathan just

762.959 --> 773.8389999999999
at this point i guess doesn't give a

764.639 --> 773.839
[ __ ] anymore

774.32 --> 787.839
with the minor things at least

790.55 --> 797.279
[Music]

795.36 --> 798.48
like i think nathan's pretty well aware

797.279 --> 800.399
that they're like

798.48 --> 802.32
how the trolls are that they're there

800.399 --> 804.8
that they play games

802.32 --> 807.44
to amuse themselves and kind of derive

804.8 --> 810.4799999999999
some kind of occult power

807.44 --> 815.6
sensation from it but

810.48 --> 820.0
he's just using them as a market is

815.6 --> 821.36
he really is and he's even halfway open

820.0 --> 823.76
about it

821.36 --> 826.9590000000001
well not he is open about it just

823.76 --> 830.88
doesn't emphasize it a lot

826.959 --> 833.8389999999999
so he's just openly grappling them

830.88 --> 836.24
as they think they're grappling him sort

833.839 --> 836.24
of thing

840.399 --> 844.959
but it is the whole thing like

842.72 --> 846.32
psychologically is a pretty preposterous

844.959 --> 849.199
situation

846.32 --> 850.24
because these people come back thinking

849.199 --> 853.279
that they can

850.24 --> 855.519
outsmart nathan when

853.279 --> 856.399
when you look at just the facts and the

855.519 --> 859.76
details

856.399 --> 863.199
and logic

859.76 --> 866.399
and academics then they have absolutely

863.199 --> 869.519
nothing to stand on yet they still

866.399 --> 870.72
they overlook that constantly it's just

869.519 --> 873.79
this the game of

870.72 --> 875.279
overlooking things in order to get by

873.79 --> 877.76
[Music]

875.279 --> 879.92
creating your own blind spots and they

877.76 --> 883.12
rub off others

879.92 --> 884.959
that have similar

883.12 --> 886.32
things they want from the world do the

884.959 --> 890.3199999999999
same thing

886.32 --> 892.639
they copy it they copy the blind spot

890.32 --> 894.639
because they know this is bad so that

892.639 --> 897.279
means we have to erase it

894.639 --> 898.24
and bypass it whenever it comes up it's

897.279 --> 900.56
just

898.24 --> 902.88
this whole other way of approaching

900.56 --> 902.88
things

904.639 --> 908.0790000000001
like a political system

908.72 --> 912.5600000000001
but i think it becomes so ingrained so

910.959 --> 915.199
automatic that

912.56 --> 917.4399999999999
it really that they're often even not

915.199 --> 919.8389999999999
even conscious of it anymore it just

917.44 --> 921.12
happens to them because they got so used

919.839 --> 924.399
to that system and

921.12 --> 926.079
their intuition just does that so their

924.399 --> 928.48
intuition plays a game

926.079 --> 931.68
with them eventually and their

928.48 --> 936.48
consciousness isn't even doing it

931.68 --> 936.4799999999999
and they're stuck they're stuck in their

938.839 --> 942.24
belief

940.0 --> 943.6
yeah nathan is like fully aware of this

942.24 --> 946.88
he's

943.6 --> 949.839
proven many times by just explaining the

946.88 --> 952.079
details and in the moment pointing out

949.839 --> 952.8800000000001
how it works like really well timed when

952.079 --> 956.6389999999999
it is like

952.88 --> 959.92
the real the like his timing

956.639 --> 962.16
proves that he really understands

959.92 --> 965.8389999999999
and yeah you got to see it you got to be

962.16 --> 968.0
able to see that to recognize it

965.839 --> 968.9590000000001
it's also a bit of an issue with me i

968.0 --> 972.24
guess

968.959 --> 975.04
even more so you gotta see it to

972.24 --> 975.04
recognize it

976.639 --> 983.759
you gotta have the sight the inside

980.48 --> 986.9590000000001
but anyway yeah the ballers

983.759 --> 996.0
they are very amusing

986.959 --> 999.5999999999999
in a sort of tragic way i guess

996.0 --> 1002.72
a way it's yeah let's get a bit

999.6 --> 1005.36
philosophical here maybe

1002.72 --> 1006.639
i might be like screwing up the flavor

1005.36 --> 1011.839
here a little but

1006.639 --> 1011.839
in a way you could almost say like

1012.0 --> 1016.72
ballers karmically don't have a right to

1015.44 --> 1019.36
just butt in and

1016.72 --> 1020.5600000000001
trying to ruin flat earthers or

1019.36 --> 1023.1990000000001
anybody's lives

1020.56 --> 1023.7589999999999
like nobody but at the same time they

1023.199 --> 1029.039
have

1023.759 --> 1032.959
a karmic right to be so tenacious

1029.039 --> 1035.36
because they're outflanked out

1032.959 --> 1037.3600000000001
well not outnumbered but they're just

1035.36 --> 1040.559
they're in the losing position they are

1037.36 --> 1042.319
in the underdog position within that

1040.559 --> 1045.439
field

1042.319 --> 1045.839
and yeah so it is more natural to be

1045.439 --> 1048.4
more

1045.839 --> 1050.72
extreme in your in your defensiveness

1048.4 --> 1053.679
more sneaky

1050.72 --> 1055.6000000000001
more trixie because they're in the

1053.679 --> 1059.3600000000001
underdog position

1055.6 --> 1063.52
and that way it's almost like justified

1059.36 --> 1066.6399999999999
but in the face of just the technicals

1063.52 --> 1068.8799999999999
just the field it's just a waste that

1066.64 --> 1072.0800000000002
it's not justified it is a distraction

1068.88 --> 1075.2
it is a red herring to what's going on

1072.08 --> 1075.1999999999998
or a non-sequitur

1076.48 --> 1083.6
but from a social position

1080.32 --> 1086.799
it is kind of justifiable because

1083.6 --> 1088.9599999999998
it is not justifiable it is logical

1086.799 --> 1090.0
that they will do that because they are

1088.96 --> 1094.48
such

1090.0 --> 1096.72
at such a loss

1094.48 --> 1098.4
within their field in which this

1096.72 --> 1100.96
conflict is taking place this

1098.4 --> 1104.48
argumentation this debate

1100.96 --> 1104.48
between the cosmologies

1105.2 --> 1110.88
and because they are losing so much yeah

1107.36 --> 1110.8799999999999
of course they have to do that

1113.52 --> 1118.16
also just try to imagine basically

1116.72 --> 1121.679
taking the specific

1118.16 --> 1123.2
specific specificity away off the

1121.679 --> 1125.6000000000001
cosmologies and the

1123.2 --> 1128.559
setting in any type of conflict if you

1125.6 --> 1130.559
try to champion something

1128.559 --> 1134.08
even if you figure out like you're on

1130.559 --> 1136.8799999999999
the losing side or you're wrong

1134.08 --> 1138.6399999999999
if you're very invested and you build up

1136.88 --> 1141.1200000000001
to this and you got all these skills

1138.64 --> 1142.0800000000002
it's very tough to step away even if you

1141.12 --> 1144.799
realize that

1142.08 --> 1146.6399999999999
it might be wrong because of loyalty and

1144.799 --> 1149.84
because you got used to it

1146.64 --> 1152.72
and all that it's

1149.84 --> 1153.6
difficult to do that and some can just

1152.72 --> 1156.64
step away

1153.6 --> 1156.6399999999999
and that's actually

1158.16 --> 1163.52
applause worthy because it is really

1161.76 --> 1165.28
difficult and even though you do it

1163.52 --> 1167.12
silently

1165.28 --> 1169.2
like for yeah you could compare this

1167.12 --> 1170.9599999999998
that to a baller that would be

1169.2 --> 1172.72
defending the ball and then at some

1170.96 --> 1173.2
point they just step away because they

1172.72 --> 1177.2
realize

1173.2 --> 1180.32
like this is i did

1177.2 --> 1183.28
they haven't made a habit of blanking

1180.32 --> 1185.2
out the knowledge to keep on defending

1183.28 --> 1188.16
or trying to defending finding some new

1185.2 --> 1190.16
frontier to try and defend the ball

1188.16 --> 1191.679
they actually let the facts through and

1190.16 --> 1195.28
then

1191.679 --> 1195.2800000000002
yeah and then they step away

1197.76 --> 1201.52
but it's very difficult and that's why a

1199.919 --> 1202.0
lot of people start doing the other

1201.52 --> 1207.84
thing

1202.0 --> 1207.84
and gets get trapped

1214.08 --> 1224.24
right so that's yeah

1220.559 --> 1226.799
i just i've gained more sympathy

1224.24 --> 1229.36
because of that understanding because of

1226.799 --> 1231.52
yeah when one side is just

1229.36 --> 1234.6399999999999
look if both sides are kind of balanced

1231.52 --> 1237.36
out both have good arguments

1234.64 --> 1238.7990000000002
and for bad arguments where one can win

1237.36 --> 1242.799
and the other can lose

1238.799 --> 1244.799
then socially within that setup

1242.799 --> 1245.9189999999999
it's much more balanced both can get

1244.799 --> 1248.32
something and both

1245.919 --> 1250.72
both has have to concede to something or

1248.32 --> 1253.28
try to defend something right

1250.72 --> 1255.44
but this is not the case anymore with

1253.28 --> 1258.8799999999999
the flat earth debates

1255.44 --> 1261.3600000000001
like we've won so we've won

1258.88 --> 1262.0800000000002
just big time there's almost no more

1261.36 --> 1265.6
maneuvering

1262.08 --> 1265.6
room left within physics

1266.08 --> 1269.84
or there isn't any more room left there

1268.32 --> 1272.8799999999999
the whole we covered the whole

1269.84 --> 1275.12
field you know

1272.88 --> 1276.24
every step of the possible routes they

1275.12 --> 1278.0
can take and

1276.24 --> 1280.32
dispel it and they don't even want to

1278.0 --> 1282.72
hear it anymore they don't want to hear

1280.32 --> 1291.84
the counter arguments anymore so they

1282.72 --> 1291.84
just romp us

1293.44 --> 1297.3600000000001
but yeah because of that there is this

1295.6 --> 1305.039
asymmetry

1297.36 --> 1307.12
because they still keep going

1305.039 --> 1308.64
and it yeah it doesn't seem like they're

1307.12 --> 1311.6789999999999
gonna stop the people that

1308.64 --> 1315.039
are making a habit of blanking out

1311.679 --> 1316.48
facts and avoiding them they are not

1315.039 --> 1318.32
going to stop

1316.48 --> 1320.48
they will keep going even though they

1318.32 --> 1322.559
are constantly losing

1320.48 --> 1323.76
but because they approached it through

1322.559 --> 1326.0
the other setting

1323.76 --> 1328.08
through the other programming blanking

1326.0 --> 1328.559
out information and then trying to worm

1328.08 --> 1331.52
your way

1328.559 --> 1332.0
through then it seems like there's still

1331.52 --> 1334.24
a chance

1332.0 --> 1335.12
for for winning somehow because you're

1334.24 --> 1337.6
withholding

1335.12 --> 1341.4399999999998
the evidence from yourself that in

1337.6 --> 1341.4399999999998
actuality there is no more room

1341.6 --> 1345.28
and they'll just keep on going but yeah

1344.24 --> 1347.44
there's an extreme

1345.28 --> 1349.84
asymmetry because we work on the really

1347.44 --> 1351.679
is level they don't

1349.84 --> 1355.52
but they still keep on going but they're

1351.679 --> 1355.52
in a loser position like they're

1362.08 --> 1367.52
trying to prevent

1365.2 --> 1375.8400000000001
it from completely crumbling down and

1367.52 --> 1375.84
there being no more voices to defend it

1380.88 --> 1384.3200000000002
but yeah again because they are losing

1383.28 --> 1386.3999999999999
so bad it is

1384.32 --> 1388.0
only logical that they would get so

1386.4 --> 1390.159
devious and

1388.0 --> 1392.4
start to fool themselves more and more

1390.159 --> 1395.6000000000001
to virtually

1392.4 --> 1395.6000000000001
gain some victories

1396.159 --> 1400.8400000000001
they can't get victories in reality then

1398.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
then they have to get it in their mind

1400.84 --> 1403.84
somehow

1403.919 --> 1408.24
or otherwise they'll get really

1414.84 --> 1417.84
depressed

1418.0 --> 1425.76
yeah bram gymnastics indeed

1421.039 --> 1430.799
right so that's ballers ballers 2020

1425.76 --> 1434.32
oh it was already kind of

1430.799 --> 1437.84
dying down in 1919

1434.32 --> 1442.08
but this year it's been really it's been

1437.84 --> 1445.6
silent overall like there's

1442.08 --> 1448.1589999999999
been more excitement when flat earthers

1445.6 --> 1450.48
went into academic discussions with

1448.159 --> 1453.8400000000001
other flat earthers

1450.48 --> 1457.039
than when ballers came on

1453.84 --> 1459.12
although it was amusing

1457.039 --> 1460.64
there was no more tension in there

1459.12 --> 1463.6789999999999
because they have nothing they

1460.64 --> 1465.6000000000001
just have nothing left only trickery

1463.679 --> 1468.24
only

1465.6 --> 1470.8799999999999
trying to amuse people in order to keep

1468.24 --> 1475.52
some attention that's basically it

1470.88 --> 1475.5200000000002
that's all that's left it's it's tragic

1483.52 --> 1489.279
and i wonder sometimes if even like the

1486.24 --> 1489.279
more official

1489.6 --> 1493.279
things concerning the bow if they are

1491.52 --> 1494.48
playing this game as well that they're

1493.279 --> 1499.679
just trying to be

1494.48 --> 1499.679
more like amusement be more amusing

1499.76 --> 1503.52
then just try to get things right

1510.799 --> 1516.4
has anybody noticed that it's like

1514.32 --> 1522.1589999999999
there's so many of these clips with

1516.4 --> 1526.4
uh astrophysicists and all that

1522.159 --> 1526.4
and uh what's his name again

1526.48 --> 1530.159
neil degrasse tyson and all that where

1529.6 --> 1533.279
they just

1530.159 --> 1534.7990000000002
say things that are so hilarious because

1533.279 --> 1536.799
of the implications

1534.799 --> 1539.36
and it's almost like they're trying to

1536.799 --> 1542.8799999999999
focus more on finding those kind of

1539.36 --> 1545.6
things to say

1542.88 --> 1546.24
like they're really latching onto the

1545.6 --> 1549.52
other

1546.24 --> 1551.6
layer within what they're saying

1549.52 --> 1553.2
they're embracing the other dimension

1551.6 --> 1556.48
they are approaching it they

1553.2 --> 1558.64
are being amusing for us

1556.48 --> 1571.84
for those that can see is anybody else

1558.64 --> 1571.8400000000001
noticing that

1573.279 --> 1577.679
a controlled moderated debate on

1576.72 --> 1580.96
national tv

1577.679 --> 1584.48
good luck with that dude once they break

1580.96 --> 1589.76
open that door

1584.48 --> 1589.76
that's yeah

1590.799 --> 1595.039
it's gonna become a mess because once

1593.2 --> 1599.8400000000001
you set that president

1595.039 --> 1599.84
president on a tv

1600.72 --> 1605.76
that's yeah you gotta understand that

1604.64 --> 1608.48
the whole tv

1605.76 --> 1609.6
and everything is all played into this

1608.48 --> 1612.88
specific

1609.6 --> 1615.279
frequency of thinking this

1612.88 --> 1616.96
it's playing into the fake reality from

1615.279 --> 1619.039
government the government level fake

1616.96 --> 1621.6000000000001
reality they can't just

1619.039 --> 1621.6
do that

1625.2 --> 1631.919
it will create a shock wave

1629.2 --> 1634.72
that is potentially even damaging they

1631.919 --> 1636.64
just do it just like that

1634.72 --> 1639.679
because that's people that are watching

1636.64 --> 1644.5590000000002
tv are specifically

1639.679 --> 1646.5590000000002
locked into that government reality

1644.559 --> 1648.399
thing that's where they want to be

1646.559 --> 1650.24
that's what they want to be real if they

1648.399 --> 1653.039
if the government then starts to break

1650.24 --> 1656.08
it by yeah taking one of the foundations

1653.039 --> 1660.32
and just letting it be smashed apart

1656.08 --> 1663.84
that's like they can't do that

1660.32 --> 1665.4399999999998
that's why i even said i i'm not 100

1663.84 --> 1666.8799999999999
sure about this but i don't think that

1665.44 --> 1670.24
the government can

1666.88 --> 1672.96
ever let go of the globe i think

1670.24 --> 1674.48
they're like locked in with it locked in

1672.96 --> 1676.88
as a story

1674.48 --> 1678.3990000000001
they can't let it go it's like

1676.88 --> 1681.5200000000002
everything has been designed and

1678.399 --> 1684.6399999999999
arranged around

1681.52 --> 1687.36
that all the side

1684.64 --> 1687.8400000000001
possibilities and plans and schemes it's

1687.36 --> 1690.4799999999998
all

1687.84 --> 1693.12
built and designed around that around

1690.48 --> 1697.039
the globe around the old

1693.12 --> 1699.36
that and it's just

1697.039 --> 1701.919
maybe there is a completely alternative

1699.36 --> 1701.9189999999999
structure

1706.72 --> 1713.6000000000001
maybe it is possible i don't know

1711.52 --> 1715.44
but it just seems like it's not being

1713.6 --> 1718.559
let go because

1715.44 --> 1718.559
even current day

1718.64 --> 1722.7990000000002
politics around the world are constantly

1721.52 --> 1725.6
latching on to

1722.799 --> 1726.72
it they're constantly trying to use it

1725.6 --> 1729.76
trying to

1726.72 --> 1731.52
be part of that story and as long as

1729.76 --> 1734.08
all the governments do that it's not

1731.52 --> 1734.08
gonna end

1735.2 --> 1740.32
they're not gonna declassify it there

1738.24 --> 1741.36
they look they're already letting people

1740.32 --> 1745.279
just discuss it

1741.36 --> 1745.279
out in the open and on the internet

1746.08 --> 1754.1589999999999
so isn't that already

1750.799 --> 1756.799
kind of generous in a way from their

1754.159 --> 1756.7990000000002
perspective

1757.76 --> 1763.279
but yeah they need their own platform in

1761.76 --> 1766.08
which

1763.279 --> 1767.6
flat earth can just be the fools that

1766.08 --> 1770.799
that basically

1767.6 --> 1772.8799999999999
oppose reality of the globe right

1770.799 --> 1776.399
and there are people that are desperate

1772.88 --> 1776.3990000000001
to lock into that

1776.48 --> 1781.84
like they're pretty desperate because

1778.72 --> 1781.84
there's a lot of people that

1782.32 --> 1788.72
just really cannot handle

1785.44 --> 1789.919
aspects of actual reality and basically

1788.72 --> 1794.88
some of the grimness

1789.919 --> 1797.3600000000001
of it and and the disillusion

1794.88 --> 1800.3200000000002
they really can't handle it i used to be

1797.36 --> 1800.32
one of these people

1801.2 --> 1804.799
it was a real struggle for me to get

1803.36 --> 1808.32
over that

1804.799 --> 1810.48
and yeah when you're that

1808.32 --> 1812.72
in need of it you have to you you there

1810.48 --> 1817.52
has to be something that just doesn't

1812.72 --> 1821.039
push a breaking factor on you

1817.52 --> 1822.08
or people will go nuts they need their

1821.039 --> 1824.32
escape

1822.08 --> 1825.36
safe space their globe safe space it's

1824.32 --> 1829.9189999999999
really as big

1825.36 --> 1832.799
basic as that they need their it's okay

1829.919 --> 1834.64
flat earthers are stupid and crazy and

1832.799 --> 1836.48
the world is a ball and everything is

1834.64 --> 1838.64
just keeping going according to

1836.48 --> 1841.1200000000001
everything you learn

1838.64 --> 1842.72
so that they can forget that maybe it's

1841.12 --> 1845.12
all a lie

1842.72 --> 1847.3600000000001
because they can't handle it they just

1845.12 --> 1850.0
can't deal with it psychologically

1847.36 --> 1851.84
but anyway it's a complex scenario and i

1850.0 --> 1855.52
just don't see

1851.84 --> 1858.1589999999999
like real flat earth being shown on tv

1855.52 --> 1860.6399999999999
at any time like i think we have to

1858.159 --> 1863.0390000000002
figure a way through all that

1860.64 --> 1864.0
to have a dual cosmogonical society

1863.039 --> 1867.12
where in one

1864.0 --> 1868.159
side of it there is the globe that

1867.12 --> 1870.1589999999999
pretends like

1868.159 --> 1872.64
it's the only thing that exists and on

1870.159 --> 1875.679
the other side there is

1872.64 --> 1875.679
the flat earthers

1876.0 --> 1880.799
yeah or the free people people that

1879.279 --> 1883.2
yeah are going to have a lot of trouble

1880.799 --> 1885.12
even saying what are we oh no we're not

1883.2 --> 1887.039
this we're not that we're just

1885.12 --> 1888.9599999999998
this or we're that we're something else

1887.039 --> 1893.6
so everybody has to be a special boy

1888.96 --> 1898.48
that's a problem that it will persist

1893.6 --> 1900.36
unfortunately but i think that we're

1898.48 --> 1904.3990000000001
like already sort of in a

1900.36 --> 1907.76
dual-cosmogonical society like that

1904.399 --> 1909.279
we just have to deal with it we have to

1907.76 --> 1913.519
deal with that there is

1909.279 --> 1918.0
a faction that ignores us

1913.519 --> 1921.84
fully that ignores our plights

1918.0 --> 1921.84
they're not gonna go away

1922.64 --> 1926.3200000000002
it doesn't matter that we've won it

1924.559 --> 1930.0
doesn't matter we have all the facts it

1926.32 --> 1935.84
doesn't matter we did all the research

1930.0 --> 1935.84
they reserve the right to ignore us

1936.88 --> 1940.159
and to make a [ __ ] to try and

1938.64 --> 1943.6000000000001
justify

1940.159 --> 1946.0800000000002
ignoring us or make a [ __ ] to

1943.6 --> 1951.279
counter our arguments and not listen to

1946.08 --> 1951.279
us unraveling that that's just

1955.36 --> 1959.36
yeah it's it's a religion it's a mystery

1958.72 --> 1962.48
religion

1959.36 --> 1963.6789999999999
and those are very tough to overcome

1962.48 --> 1967.279
once they take grip

1963.679 --> 1967.279
once they take a hold of somebody

1967.36 --> 1970.9599999999998
because their subconscious starts to

1970.0 --> 1976.08
take over

1970.96 --> 1977.8400000000001
starts to follow that program dude

1976.08 --> 1980.24
what the [ __ ] is up with the spamming

1977.84 --> 1980.24
idiot

1986.48 --> 1993.44
yeah yeah samson that's okay

1990.96 --> 1994.24
now that's a spammer just instantly

1993.44 --> 1997.039
delete them

1994.24 --> 1997.039
timing out is

1997.84 --> 2005.84
but whatever

2009.519 --> 2013.679
but thanks for the assistance i get

2011.679 --> 2016.3200000000002
timing out is is okay by the way if you

2013.679 --> 2019.279
time it out and i decide hidden then

2016.32 --> 2021.36
because when everybody wants to push the

2019.279 --> 2023.12
hide button then it's hide and hide hide

2021.36 --> 2025.84
and hide so i think you probably did

2023.12 --> 2025.84
the right thing

2027.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
thanks for that

2034.559 --> 2047.84
he has been what here we go again

2048.24 --> 2052.72
who are you referring to here we go

2050.159 --> 2055.2000000000003
again he has been everywhere with his

2052.72 --> 2055.2
anti

2055.359 --> 2061.839
this fabric oh

2066.079 --> 2073.3590000000004
okay well look the mess

2069.52 --> 2077.52
yeah it's a bit cervani like if he just

2073.359 --> 2080.72
say that that's fine

2077.52 --> 2083.359
it's well please don't do it caps

2080.72 --> 2085.7599999999998
but if you have like oh savonia there's

2083.359 --> 2088.0
this ultimate doom and it's all this

2085.76 --> 2089.44
right well we've seen that [ __ ] for

2088.0 --> 2091.76
decades now

2089.44 --> 2092.7200000000003
you want to put that in a message okay

2091.76 --> 2096.2400000000002
fine don't

2092.72 --> 2097.68
spam my chat okay that's where i have a

2096.24 --> 2098.4799999999996
problem if you want to say something

2097.68 --> 2101.5989999999997
that is like

2098.48 --> 2102.0
halfway ridiculous i don't mind just

2101.599 --> 2104.88
don't

2102.0 --> 2104.88
spam my chat

2105.28 --> 2110.1600000000003
because a lot of people have ridiculous

2107.599 --> 2110.1600000000003
ideas

2110.24 --> 2113.2
but if you yeah

2114.079 --> 2118.5600000000004
you can respond to them you can't point

2116.16 --> 2121.359
out why

2118.56 --> 2122.7999999999997
or what about it may be halfway sensible

2121.359 --> 2125.92
and then people can

2122.8 --> 2128.4
deal with those ideas now that it's

2125.92 --> 2131.839
being recognized as something

2128.4 --> 2131.839
and then maybe you can move on

2135.28 --> 2139.6800000000003
but yeah the spamming it i don't like

2137.52 --> 2142.4
that it's just

2139.68 --> 2142.3999999999996
a nuisance

2143.44 --> 2146.48
hey max martin

2149.52 --> 2156.24
oh god it

2153.42 --> 2158.48
[Music]

2156.24 --> 2159.52
yeah i think exponential monk is just

2158.48 --> 2161.28
one of those that

2159.52 --> 2163.68
hangs around the flat earth debate chat

2161.28 --> 2163.6800000000003
a lot

2165.68 --> 2169.52
people have known here this round for

2167.52 --> 2172.64
millennia right

2169.52 --> 2177.119
right no

2172.64 --> 2177.1189999999997
no that's technically not even correct

2177.68 --> 2184.96
officially alba rooney supposedly proved

2181.2 --> 2188.16
the radius now let's not get into that

2184.96 --> 2201.839
technically but that's official

2188.16 --> 2201.839
that that's not millennial

2206.1 --> 2209.219
[Music]

2213.2 --> 2228.24
i think dean white let's not go with

2215.28 --> 2243.2000000000003
caps please

2228.24 --> 2245.7599999999998
the horizons to move god

2243.2 --> 2247.9199999999996
yeah look this exponential monk is just

2245.76 --> 2252.6400000000003
scattergunning his

2247.92 --> 2252.64
it's just standard superficial nonsense

2252.72 --> 2256.64
like every point he's making has been

2254.56 --> 2258.56
addressed to no end

2256.64 --> 2259.68
so he should know this so again this is

2258.56 --> 2262.7999999999997
a person that is

2259.68 --> 2265.9199999999996
actively defending or

2262.8 --> 2267.04
proclaiming his beliefs that the ball

2265.92 --> 2269.2000000000003
and he's just

2267.04 --> 2270.96
scattergunning with things that he

2269.2 --> 2274.3199999999997
ignores the response to

2270.96 --> 2276.0
so he holds on he leaves it a mystery he

2274.32 --> 2280.0
makes an argument and then he basically

2276.0 --> 2283.52
to himself leaves it a mystery

2280.0 --> 2284.0
and just holds on to it it's a mystery

2283.52 --> 2287.359
religion

2284.0 --> 2290.8
isn't it the mystery is you

2287.359 --> 2293.44
blanking out the details for yourself

2290.8 --> 2294.079
that's the mystery factor in the mystery

2293.44 --> 2296.8
religion

2294.079 --> 2298.079
you uphold your own mystery you keep it

2296.8 --> 2301.6800000000003
a mystery to yourself

2298.079 --> 2312.6400000000003
what the reality is to maintain

2301.68 --> 2316.64
the vision of the belief

2312.64 --> 2316.64
can alter the distance what

2318.24 --> 2323.5989999999997
no refraction is it's an optical effect

2322.079 --> 2326.7200000000003
it

2323.599 --> 2329.28
like by any standard it's up what

2326.72 --> 2330.0
refraction can alter the distance no

2329.28 --> 2333.2000000000003
it's

2330.0 --> 2335.839
it obviously cannot

2333.2 --> 2335.839
what the hell

2338.24 --> 2342.16
somebody's getting really confused here

2352.72 --> 2358.0
optical distance opt

2356.0 --> 2359.119
what is an optical distance you mean

2358.0 --> 2362.4
apparent distance

2359.119 --> 2366.0
not real distance not actual not

2362.4 --> 2369.839
euclidean measurable distance

2366.0 --> 2369.839
yeah sure

2381.359 --> 2386.0789999999997
distance measured by sight

2386.8 --> 2392.079
no no

2390.079 --> 2393.76
not really that's not really how that

2392.079 --> 2397.04
works

2393.76 --> 2400.48
when sight is involved you actually

2397.04 --> 2405.68
take a look and then you find

2400.48 --> 2405.68
within the site reference point

2405.76 --> 2412.5600000000004
that you use on an established map

2409.2 --> 2415.9199999999996
where it is shown where everything

2412.56 --> 2416.64
is and then you can cross-reference what

2415.92 --> 2419.839
you see

2416.64 --> 2422.96
in the picture with a map

2419.839 --> 2424.7999999999997
where you know where these things are

2422.96 --> 2426.4
and that's how you determine the

2424.8 --> 2430.96
distance just

2426.4 --> 2432.96
seeing things it doesn't work that way

2430.96 --> 2435.119
you have to cross-reference it with

2432.96 --> 2436.96
something where you know the actual

2435.119 --> 2439.839
distances

2436.96 --> 2439.839
don't you get that

2441.92 --> 2445.92
seeing is just apparent if there's no

2444.319 --> 2453.839
cross-references

2445.92 --> 2453.839
it's ridiculous

2459.839 --> 2468.96
no that's not a problem max martin

2466.64 --> 2470.16
when it concerns to visuals that's not a

2468.96 --> 2473.599
problem at all

2470.16 --> 2476.3999999999996
now they may show you layout of maps

2473.599 --> 2476.88
where there is no street view or

2476.4 --> 2478.7200000000003
something

2476.88 --> 2481.28
and then it yeah then you don't know did

2478.72 --> 2484.16
you just gotta go by what they show you

2481.28 --> 2488.1600000000003
is there in the way they show it but

2484.16 --> 2490.56
when it comes to actual visuals

2488.16 --> 2492.56
locations where you can go yourself no

2490.56 --> 2495.7599999999998
that is pretty i think that most of that

2492.56 --> 2498.7999999999997
is pretty reliable

2495.76 --> 2502.4
map wise the layout the

2498.8 --> 2503.8390000000004
euclidean layout but yeah

2502.4 --> 2505.52
the things where you can't

2503.839 --> 2509.359
cross-reference it it

2505.52 --> 2511.119
you just have the map

2509.359 --> 2512.72
you can't visually go there or anything

2511.119 --> 2515.04
to confirm it yet

2512.72 --> 2523.839
those are in their hands their

2515.04 --> 2523.839
representation is theirs alone

2532.16 --> 2551.839
donkey dick geometry that doesn't exist

2535.599 --> 2551.839
tin tin man

2562.839 --> 2565.839
laughs

2570.8 --> 2577.8390000000004
no hypothesis in the experiment

2574.56 --> 2580.96
angular size distance

2577.839 --> 2584.24
object well i'm afraid that angular size

2580.96 --> 2588.56
and distance of an object

2584.24 --> 2591.7599999999998
are not proper

2588.56 --> 2595.7599999999998
yeah elements to use in

2591.76 --> 2598.96
experiment i'm afraid

2595.76 --> 2600.88
it's not science it's not an experiment

2598.96 --> 2607.839
and it's definitely not a hypothesis

2600.88 --> 2611.76
experimental monk i think you're

2607.839 --> 2614.16
you might ris yeah revert back to

2611.76 --> 2617.0400000000004
saying it's colloquial hypothesis

2614.16 --> 2619.92
colloquial experiment

2617.04 --> 2621.599
and yeah sure you can fool around and

2619.92 --> 2625.119
test whatever

2621.599 --> 2625.119
geometry sure

2626.56 --> 2635.839
it's not signs though

2646.16 --> 2649.839
yeah little

2663.359 --> 2677.839
exhale garden

2684.16 --> 2693.839
right yeah oh wow you got that

2688.4 --> 2696.64
mostly right although yeah it's

2693.839 --> 2698.4
you could improve upon that a little but

2696.64 --> 2700.96
the problem is that

2698.4 --> 2702.079
when you get to the actual thing you're

2700.96 --> 2705.599
trying to prove

2702.079 --> 2706.8
within the hypothesis there are certain

2705.599 --> 2709.599
things that

2706.8 --> 2709.92
just don't fall into natural sciences

2709.599 --> 2714.0
and

2709.92 --> 2719.119
those are apparent things

2714.0 --> 2721.76
they're like apparent distances

2719.119 --> 2723.04
and yeah distances in general or

2721.76 --> 2727.3590000000004
apparent sizes

2723.04 --> 2730.72
sizes and distances those are like

2727.359 --> 2732.96
that doesn't fall under science

2730.72 --> 2735.04
it doesn't fall under the natural

2732.96 --> 2737.04
sciences

2735.04 --> 2739.52
sciences of the natural world so yeah

2737.04 --> 2741.68
that's i think you're overlooking that

2739.52 --> 2745.599
you are reifying

2741.68 --> 2761.68
geometric tests within science

3887.68 --> 3890.799

but it was pretty pretty white looking

3890.799 --> 3896.4

count as answering every single question

4172.319 --> 4177.279
no it doesn't

try to declare your baller victory

4187.279 --> 4191.839000000001
triumph somewhere else where

4189.199 --> 4193.2789999999995
people are more inclined to entertain

4191.839 --> 4203.84
your delusions

4193.279 --> 4203.84
thank you very much

4207.6 --> 4212.8
what dean what i wouldn't say that

4210.56 --> 4216.88
necessarily oh maybe you're right

4212.8 --> 4220.320000000001
it's pretty pathetic though

4216.88 --> 4224.8
like that's pro these are paid

4220.32 --> 4224.799999999999
that is really pathetic like they're

4228.84 --> 4231.84
[ __ ]

4233.36 --> 4245.839999999999
they're pretty shitty they got nothing

4260.32 --> 4267.199
right sex sterling well i i do better

4263.84 --> 4267.1990000000005
i actually am still

4268.64 --> 4275.04
developing baller cosmology

4273.12 --> 4276.4
i keep on developing it where the

4275.04 --> 4279.84
ballers are just

4276.4 --> 4283.04
screwing things up so

4279.84 --> 4284.400000000001
me as a open flat earther i am more

4283.04 --> 4287.679
effective

4284.4 --> 4289.12
at basically building heliocentric

4287.679 --> 4292.2390000000005
cosmology

4289.12 --> 4293.76
then ballers are or paid trolls then

4292.239 --> 4296.48
anybody that's getting paid

4293.76 --> 4297.280000000001
you know why because i'm bored because

4296.48 --> 4300.48
because

4297.28 --> 4301.04
we have won that much we have someone so

4300.48 --> 4303.199
much

4301.04 --> 4304.64
that they're simply not even any real

4303.199 --> 4306.879999999999
challenge anymore

4304.64 --> 4308.719
in trying to debate a baller about their

4306.88 --> 4309.12
beliefs there's no challenge in it

4308.719 --> 4311.44
because

4309.12 --> 4312.5599999999995
they only spend their time red hairing

4311.44 --> 4314.0
and blanking

4312.56 --> 4315.76
details out and trying to fool

4314.0 --> 4319.12
everybody's scatter gun

4315.76 --> 4319.12
until you're just sick of it

4319.84 --> 4326.159000000001
i'm so bored with that that i'm just

4322.88 --> 4328.4800000000005
taking over their role out of sheer

4326.159 --> 4330.08
freaking boredom because they're that

4328.48 --> 4332.4
useless

4330.08 --> 4335.199
and they get paid for being useless can

4332.4 --> 4335.199
you imagine that

4336.96 --> 4340.2390000000005
i don't even get paid for this for doing

4339.36 --> 4343.44
that

4340.239 --> 4346.0
thing i don't think people that support

4343.44 --> 4349.28
me over paypal and everything here

4346.0 --> 4351.76
in my show i don't think that they

4349.28 --> 4354.159
particularly appreciate that

4351.76 --> 4355.84
thing that i'm doing like oh yeah

4354.159 --> 4358.239
einstein in gravity bending of

4355.84 --> 4359.52
space-time oh yeah i can work with that

4358.239 --> 4361.36
i don't think they're paying me

4359.52 --> 4363.360000000001
specifically to do that i think they

4361.36 --> 4365.04
probably

4363.36 --> 4367.12
makes them a little nervous or something

4365.04 --> 4370.159
or maybe they don't care

4367.12 --> 4371.76
but yeah i'm just doing it out of

4370.159 --> 4374.48
boredom and i'm better than

4371.76 --> 4377.52
anybody out there at it that actually

4374.48 --> 4377.5199999999995
believes this [ __ ]

4379.36 --> 4384.88
yeah get it trolls you're getting paid

4382.64 --> 4386.08
you're yeah you're getting paid to be

4384.88 --> 4389.4400000000005
useless

4386.08 --> 4391.12
i do a better job at defending the thing

4389.44 --> 4394.4
you're paid to defend

4391.12 --> 4397.5199999999995
out of freaking boredom okay you're

4394.4 --> 4400.639999999999
that [ __ ] useless

4397.52 --> 4400.64
for your information

4406.08 --> 4410.64
no i know that because i'm actually

4408.32 --> 4413.599999999999
doing it i'm not just

4410.64 --> 4415.76
spending all my time trying to uphold

4413.6 --> 4416.8
some kind of fake personality and fake

4415.76 --> 4419.12
claims and

4416.8 --> 4420.8
fake statements in order to convince

4419.12 --> 4422.8
myself that i am winning

4420.8 --> 4424.88
i'm not wasting all my time doing that

4422.8 --> 4426.400000000001
i'm actually getting into the mechanics

4424.88 --> 4431.04
i'm actually building

4426.4 --> 4431.04
your cosmology yeah

4431.199 --> 4437.12
i am building your belief

4434.719 --> 4438.159
and at some point you will have no other

4437.12 --> 4442.239
choice

4438.159 --> 4446.4
than to follow my works

4442.239 --> 4446.4
because there's nowhere else left to go

4449.52 --> 4453.76
i can literally just take over at some

4451.92 --> 4457.04
point if i wanted to

4453.76 --> 4457.76
to guide your beliefs that's right and

4457.04 --> 4460.32
there would be

4457.76 --> 4461.1990000000005
nothing you could do about it i'll take

4460.32 --> 4464.639999999999
control

4461.199 --> 4468.639999999999
just like that how

4464.64 --> 4472.0
by knowing more and understanding better

4468.64 --> 4473.679
that's right and i don't even have to

4472.0 --> 4477.44
get paid for it i'll do it out of

4473.679 --> 4477.4400000000005
freaking boredom how about that

4478.8 --> 4483.04
because if i do anything seriously then

4481.28 --> 4485.87
i'll have to get paid like six million

4483.04 --> 4487.84
for that or something

4485.87 --> 4492.159
[Music]

4487.84 --> 4492.159000000001
but yeah that's probably not gonna

4494.84 --> 4497.84
happen

4499.44 --> 4506.239
no it's not my own view

4502.719 --> 4507.44
no it's actually just accounting for

4506.239 --> 4509.919999999999
things that are issues

4507.44 --> 4510.96
actually having responses to question

4509.92 --> 4513.84
that makes sense

4510.96 --> 4514.56
or halfway sense unlike any of the

4513.84 --> 4517.679
ballers

4514.56 --> 4521.679
that just ignore [ __ ] and start to

4517.679 --> 4523.76
completely route out like unroot

4521.679 --> 4526.2390000000005
the foundations of everything like

4523.76 --> 4528.08
natural law science everything just

4526.239 --> 4530.0
rip it all out throw it all away it

4528.08 --> 4530.88
doesn't mean anything it's all made up

4530.0 --> 4533.28
that's what you're

4530.88 --> 4535.92
[ __ ] doing you retards you're

4533.28 --> 4536.639999999999
literally destroying the foundations of

4535.92 --> 4538.88
knowledge

4536.64 --> 4540.0
just to win your stupid little belief

4538.88 --> 4542.8
game yeah

4540.0 --> 4543.44
you don't need to do that you morons but

4542.8 --> 4546.0
you're too

4543.44 --> 4548.08
arrogant and lame and short-sighted to

4546.0 --> 4550.239
even realize that

4548.08 --> 4552.159
from within your delusion you're too

4550.239 --> 4554.639999999999
stupid to realize

4552.159 --> 4556.159
that you don't even need to destroy

4554.64 --> 4560.0
everything to progress

4556.159 --> 4560.0
you're too freaking dumb

4567.92 --> 4571.28
oh yeah well you should have listened

4569.679 --> 4573.84
yesterday

4571.28 --> 4576.32
because it was being thrown away it was

4573.84 --> 4578.96
being said no that's what you made up

4576.32 --> 4580.96
flat earthers made up natural law it's

4578.96 --> 4583.92
[ __ ]

4580.96 --> 4587.12
all kinds of [ __ ] all over the place

4583.92 --> 4587.12
yeah that's what's happening

4590.32 --> 4594.5599999999995
and it's being echoed on higher levels

4592.48 --> 4598.159
on speaking points

4594.56 --> 4601.120000000001
yeah you have no control

4598.159 --> 4602.719
you're just destroying everything oh you

4601.12 --> 4604.64
might still believe it you might think

4602.719 --> 4606.32
oh yeah well

4604.64 --> 4609.84
that's foolish right well you're not

4606.32 --> 4609.84
solving it either

4610.719 --> 4616.56
just holding back as it all crumbles

4613.6 --> 4619.679
into insanity and demonic

4616.56 --> 4622.2390000000005
denial fundamental reality you don't

4619.679 --> 4624.0
fix it you don't really have answers to

4622.239 --> 4626.799999999999
the housekeeping questions

4624.0 --> 4626.8
to any of it

4631.199 --> 4634.839999999999
which natural law am i referring to

4633.199 --> 4637.759999999999
entropy entropy

4634.84 --> 4639.92
law gas entropy

4637.76 --> 4643.6
law specifically expanding in all

4639.92 --> 4651.84
directions to fill the available volume

4643.6 --> 4651.84
yeah that one

4653.44 --> 4659.04
oh you think you have no you don't

4656.64 --> 4659.76
you don't have any answer for it you

4659.04 --> 4662.64
just have

4659.76 --> 4663.76
[ __ ] made up things that make no

4662.64 --> 4666.320000000001
damn sense

4663.76 --> 4668.320000000001
are super hypothetical based on

4666.32 --> 4670.159
mathematic reification

4668.32 --> 4672.48
of things that aren't even proven to be

4670.159 --> 4672.48
there

4673.28 --> 4680.32
it's all [ __ ] you can't solve it

4676.719 --> 4680.32
by bypassing it like that

4681.44 --> 4687.199
but by trying to negate natural laws

4684.48 --> 4687.199
it doesn't work

4688.32 --> 4691.759999999999
yeah because i already heard everything

4690.64 --> 4694.8
i've been here

4691.76 --> 4698.64
every freaking day for four years

4694.8 --> 4701.76
alminator every day here

4698.64 --> 4704.400000000001
for four years every day yeah

4701.76 --> 4707.84
heard it all there's nothing you can

4704.4 --> 4710.799999999999
make up

4707.84 --> 4712.08
i'm better at it and i'm just here and

4710.8 --> 4714.719
there sparsely

4712.08 --> 4717.5199999999995
throwing out suggestions that obviously

4714.719 --> 4717.52
nobody gets

4718.159 --> 4722.799999999999
you don't have anything all that garbage

4720.96 --> 4725.199
that's out there on wikipedia

4722.8 --> 4727.12
supposedly explaining it away it's just

4725.199 --> 4729.04
that it's garbage

4727.12 --> 4730.719
it's garbage it doesn't make any sense

4729.04 --> 4733.84
there's no empirical proof for it it's

4730.719 --> 4737.199
based on reifications

4733.84 --> 4740.2390000000005
it's [ __ ] so any of that data

4737.199 --> 4742.719
that you're supposedly mastered

4740.239 --> 4743.759999999999
right to counter whatever you think

4742.719 --> 4748.08
arguments

4743.76 --> 4749.04
we have that you can overcome supposedly

4748.08 --> 4751.12
yeah it's wrong

4749.04 --> 4753.12
it's just wrong and it's been explained

4751.12 --> 4755.28
to no end

4753.12 --> 4758.32
sick of telling ballers that it's

4755.28 --> 4758.32
[ __ ] and why

4758.4 --> 4762.0
and you not listening and then moving

4760.4 --> 4763.839999999999
away and then somebody else comes

4762.0 --> 4777.84
back and does the same thing over and

4763.84 --> 4777.84
over and over again

4784.46 --> 4791.779
[Music]

4792.719 --> 4795.84
yeah what makes it natural law is that

4794.56 --> 4800.2390000000005
it always happens

4795.84 --> 4802.400000000001
and it cannot be prevented to happen

4800.239 --> 4803.759999999999
it always works like that and that's how

4802.4 --> 4806.879999999999
it's established

4803.76 --> 4806.88
there's no exception

4815.28 --> 4821.759999999999
why do i ask the housekeeping questions

4818.32 --> 4825.04
then if you are not interested

4821.76 --> 4827.04
because if you had an actual rebuttal

4825.04 --> 4828.639
you would go on the flat earth debates

4827.04 --> 4831.48
and quickly present it

4828.639 --> 4833.36
and then get mauled for as i said

4831.48 --> 4837.12
reification

4833.36 --> 4840.4
[ __ ] as you always do

4837.12 --> 4843.599999999999
because you've already indulged in

4840.4 --> 4845.5199999999995
in believing all this nonsense

4843.6 --> 4847.84
about what science is what you can do

4845.52 --> 4850.88
with it and how we're wrong how we're

4847.84 --> 4852.4800000000005
misinterpreting words and [ __ ] when that

4850.88 --> 4855.52
is exactly what you're doing

4852.48 --> 4858.718999999999
and it's provable it's like

4855.52 --> 4858.719
you can pinpoint it

4859.04 --> 4865.6
so it's just done there's nothing you

4862.96 --> 4865.6
can say

4866.159 --> 4870.36
i've heard it already it's 2020. it was

4869.04 --> 4873.36
already done in

4870.36 --> 4873.36
2019

4873.52 --> 4879.120000000001
if there was anything viable it would

4876.0 --> 4879.12
have been presented

4880.0 --> 4883.679
yeah well you're not saying anything

4881.92 --> 4885.76
eliminator you haven't actually

4883.679 --> 4886.719
addressed anything you're just saying no

4885.76 --> 4888.96
we have it

4886.719 --> 4889.92
no we have it oh why aren't you not

4888.96 --> 4892.4
listening to

4889.92 --> 4893.04
that we have it we have it we have the

4892.4 --> 4895.04
evidence

4893.04 --> 4896.239
yeah well you're not even addressing

4895.04 --> 4897.84
what it is

4896.239 --> 4899.44
so you don't have anything you're just

4897.84 --> 4900.84
freaking gaslighting me and i'm banning

4899.44 --> 4904.32
you for it

4900.84 --> 4906.8
[ __ ] [ __ ] off if you got something to

4904.32 --> 4909.36
present go to the flat earth debates

4906.8 --> 4910.96
and discord and present it and shut the

4909.36 --> 4916.61
[ __ ] up

4910.96 --> 4919.76
if you don't

4916.61 --> 4919.759999999999
[Music]

4927.6 --> 4930.639
done with these stupid ballers whining

4930.0 --> 4932.639
about

4930.639 --> 4934.400000000001
you're not listening you're not hearing

4932.639 --> 4936.56
other yet because you're not saying

4934.4 --> 4938.48
anything you're not rebutting anything

4936.56 --> 4939.92
you're just talking about how you do

4938.48 --> 4942.0
have things and how

4939.92 --> 4943.679
you're so surprised that we won't listen

4942.0 --> 4944.08
to those things that you won't actually

4943.679 --> 4947.1990000000005
mention

4944.08 --> 4951.44
what it is for like half an hour well

4947.199 --> 4959.839999999999
[ __ ] off you just say what it is or get

4951.44 --> 4959.839999999999
the [ __ ] out i'm sick of that [ __ ]

maybe not next year but maybe the year i

5124.56 --> 5128.320000000001
don't know at some point i'm gonna get

5126.32 --> 5130.88
out of this social welfare situation

5128.32 --> 5130.88
where i just

5131.36 --> 5135.28
got more i can feel it i'm gonna get out

5134.8 --> 5137.6
of it

5135.28 --> 5139.679
and then eventually yeah even the super

5137.6 --> 5142.2390000000005
chat donations

5139.679 --> 5144.719
through google and the advertisement one

5142.239 --> 5146.718999999999
you i will just get as income

5144.719 --> 5148.88
instead of having it detracted from my

5146.719 --> 5152.08
social welfare check

5148.88 --> 5155.36
every month so

5152.08 --> 5158.0
i'm kind of looking forward to that too

5155.36 --> 5158.48
but i'm not there yet but it's building

5158.0 --> 5160.639
i

5158.48 --> 5164.32
got all kinds of sources my financial

5160.639 --> 5167.36
situation could be improving

5164.32 --> 5172.08
from at least pretty good

5167.36 --> 5172.08
to potentially really good i don't know

5175.679 --> 5180.84
i just there's still a lot to figure out

5179.18 --> 5182.0
[Music]

5180.84 --> 5183.84
though

5182.0 --> 5185.679
where is obermo kumar called well mark

5183.84 --> 5188.56
collard is still around and amanda young

5185.679 --> 5188.56
was here in chat

5189.04 --> 5192.56
just like half an hour ago unfortunate

5191.36 --> 5194.5599999999995
reality

5192.56 --> 5195.679
so mark collard i don't know i don't

5194.56 --> 5198.0
think it's

5195.679 --> 5199.92
he's busy during these times but i do

5198.0 --> 5202.32
speak to him in other chats and he

5199.92 --> 5204.2390000000005
he this is still following the chat or

5202.32 --> 5205.84
is it still following the show

5204.239 --> 5207.599999999999
but not live anymore i think he's

5205.84 --> 5209.92
probably busy during that time

5207.6 --> 5212.8
as for obermoco i don't know nobody has

5209.92 --> 5215.92
really seen obermoco

5212.8 --> 5220.88
since that one time

5215.92 --> 5220.88
uh is it now two months ago by now

5223.199 --> 5230.239
yeah in november and then he just

5226.239 --> 5230.638999999999
left and nobody's really seen him before

5230.239 --> 5235.599999999999
so

5230.639 --> 5237.6
yeah hope obermuco is all right

5235.6 --> 5240.320000000001
but yeah more color than amanda young

5237.6 --> 5240.320000000001
they're still around

5245.28 --> 5250.0
but yeah as for crew and people that

5247.679 --> 5250.0
follow

5250.159 --> 5254.08
there's been many people that have

5251.84 --> 5257.52
followed me like from really early on

5254.08 --> 5257.5199999999995
that have kind of moved on

5258.0 --> 5262.239
sorry to say i've technically even

5260.08 --> 5264.159
forgotten your name but if i would see

5262.239 --> 5266.159
it again i would probably

5264.159 --> 5268.32
be like hey whoa i haven't seen you in a

5266.159 --> 5270.0
long time because in my subconscious

5268.32 --> 5271.759999999999
memory it's still there it's just my

5270.0 --> 5273.52
conscious memory i'm not

5271.76 --> 5275.4400000000005
really dealing with it anymore because

5273.52 --> 5279.120000000001
there's a lot of people

5275.44 --> 5283.199
coming and going constantly

5279.12 --> 5286.32
it was very confusing to me at the start

5283.199 --> 5289.12
that internet people come and go

5286.32 --> 5290.48
because i wasn't you i was more to face

5289.12 --> 5293.599999999999
to face

5290.48 --> 5294.799999999999
used to that i wasn't on the internet a

5293.6 --> 5297.84
lot

5294.8 --> 5301.360000000001
i wasn't a social media person

5297.84 --> 5303.360000000001
before i got onto flat earth

5301.36 --> 5306.159
and in the beginning it was even quite

5303.36 --> 5306.159
shocking to me

5306.239 --> 5309.5199999999995
like people would just leave and i would

5308.48 --> 5312.5599999999995
be like feeling

5309.52 --> 5314.8
really bad about it

5312.56 --> 5315.679
because i just held more weight onto

5314.8 --> 5317.84
that

5315.679 --> 5319.52
because i wasn't used to it now i'm i'm

5317.84 --> 5321.4400000000005
different about it i just know people

5319.52 --> 5324.88
come and go

5321.44 --> 5326.96
it's no use to choking yourself up about

5324.88 --> 5326.96
it

5329.52 --> 5335.1990000000005
and just yeah be nice and enjoy

5332.719 --> 5336.96
while they're there and yeah learn

5335.199 --> 5339.919999999999
together

5336.96 --> 5341.6
and that's it and then at some point

5339.92 --> 5344.0
they might just go they might just

5341.6 --> 5345.04
have enough of it they might have just

5344.0 --> 5347.679
yeah i had enough

5345.04 --> 5348.639
of this like they got everything out of

5347.679 --> 5350.719
me

5348.639 --> 5352.32
out of what my message that they needed

5350.719 --> 5354.0
to get and then they're just gonna do

5352.32 --> 5354.48
something else that's how it works in

5354.0 --> 5357.04
life

5354.48 --> 5359.44
and i'm okay with that anyway thank you

5357.04 --> 5361.92
tony whitcomb for the 30 pound super

5359.44 --> 5363.678999999999
chat donation happy new year sir

5361.92 --> 5366.2390000000005
a celebration for either oh thank you

5363.679 --> 5366.2390000000005
very much

5366.32 --> 5369.199
i appreciate that

5369.679 --> 5375.28
it's a pretty big super chat

5373.12 --> 5376.48
yeah though yeah i don't know if you

5375.28 --> 5378.719
knew but

5376.48 --> 5380.638999999999
i don't really get that in my account

5378.719 --> 5382.56
because it's just subtracted from my

5380.639 --> 5385.1990000000005
social welfare at this point i just

5382.56 --> 5386.639
explained that but that's okay if you

5385.199 --> 5389.678999999999
really want to hand it over

5386.639 --> 5390.88
to me paypal would be the best course of

5389.679 --> 5393.36
action

5390.88 --> 5407.84
but i appreciated gesture thank you very

5393.36 --> 5407.839999999999
much tony whitcomb

5409.76 --> 5414.639
i was here early but never participated

5412.8 --> 5416.639
believe it or not well julio pepin i

5414.639 --> 5420.639
would believe that

5416.639 --> 5423.28
i have seen you comment

5420.639 --> 5425.679
here and there very sparsely even years

5423.28 --> 5425.679
ago

5425.76 --> 5435.84
at least at the flat earth debates

5440.32 --> 5445.28
all right breaking out

5443.36 --> 5448.0
yeah the sun and moon group i yeah with

5445.28 --> 5451.04
cherries i remember all that

5448.0 --> 5453.17
that group was a mess though it's like a

5451.04 --> 5456.409
hippie dippy circle

5453.17 --> 5456.409
[Music]

5456.88 --> 5463.84
but it was very interesting yes series

5460.84 --> 5463.84
map

5464.719 --> 5470.4800000000005
that was interesting but

5468.32 --> 5473.84
i don't know where that went i don't

5470.48 --> 5473.839999999999
think it went really anywhere

5474.0 --> 5479.52
as far as like the the data the the

5477.199 --> 5480.799999999999
aberrational data i don't know what that

5479.52 --> 5484.159000000001
even is how they

5480.8 --> 5485.6
came to that data you know it's it seems

5484.159 --> 5491.36
like raw data

5485.6 --> 5493.679
now how was it gathered there's an issue

5491.36 --> 5496.239
but who knows what is out there really

5493.679 --> 5496.2390000000005
who knows

5497.6 --> 5500.96
but it did leave a big mystery for what

5500.56 --> 5505.84
is

5500.96 --> 5505.84
south i thought it was fascinating

5523.52 --> 5527.6
holy [ __ ] flowers is still a thing yes

5526.239 --> 5533.839999999999
it is a thing

5527.6 --> 5533.84
it's the thing you're standing on

5534.4 --> 5538.4
more surprisingly the globe is still a

5537.44 --> 5540.4
thing

5538.4 --> 5541.5199999999995
despite everything that's been learned

5540.4 --> 5544.5599999999995
about it

5541.52 --> 5547.679
that's the real surprise but then again

5544.56 --> 5560.88
when you know how this world works it's

5547.679 --> 5564.6990000000005
not that surprising

5560.88 --> 5564.6990000000005
[Music]

5565.36 --> 5569.759999999999
social status lamel for no no no no it's

5568.239 --> 5572.839999999999
look dude if this is just

5569.76 --> 5574.639
financial lamel forever don't worry but

5572.84 --> 5578.2390000000005
it's

5574.639 --> 5581.76
i don't have a job

5578.239 --> 5584.239
outside of what i do on youtube

5581.76 --> 5586.159000000001
don't have like a paid contractual job

5584.239 --> 5588.159
or anything

5586.159 --> 5590.08
and so i am technically on social

5588.159 --> 5592.32
welfare and how that works is that when

5590.08 --> 5595.5199999999995
i have income that i report

5592.32 --> 5597.5199999999995
and my google income is like official

5595.52 --> 5600.320000000001
and i yeah i have to share that with

5597.52 --> 5602.8
them so is my newspaper around who

5600.32 --> 5605.679
they basically take that out they take

5602.8 --> 5605.679
that out of the check

5606.159 --> 5609.44
that's just how it works

5609.92 --> 5614.159
so yeah i'm not entirely uh financially

5613.199 --> 5617.599999999999
self-sufficient

5614.159 --> 5620.0
it's an unfortunate reality but i do get

5617.6 --> 5623.4400000000005
by also thanks to the support

5620.0 --> 5624.88
the people that follow my channel

5623.44 --> 5627.759999999999
because when it comes to paypal

5624.88 --> 5629.679
donations i take it as a gift

5627.76 --> 5632.320000000001
like as if somebody was handing it over

5629.679 --> 5635.1990000000005
to me on the streets

5632.32 --> 5635.199
and i use that

5635.6 --> 5640.159000000001
to yeah keep myself fed to for

5638.4 --> 5642.638999999999
maintenance

5640.159 --> 5643.199
and all kinds of things and to try and

5642.639 --> 5648.2390000000005
like

5643.199 --> 5651.599999999999
yeah prevent myself from spiraling down

5648.239 --> 5651.599999999999
it's been a great help

5652.239 --> 5656.959999999999
like my living conditions now on average

5654.48 --> 5659.839999999999
are definitely better than they were say

5656.96 --> 5659.84
three years ago

5664.48 --> 5668.0
although at the same time a lot of the

5666.0 --> 5668.719
things that i've been using over the

5668.0 --> 5673.12
decade

5668.719 --> 5675.76
have been wearing out more also so

5673.12 --> 5675.76
but yeah

5680.56 --> 5687.84
hmm yeah thanks julia pepin

5708.0 --> 5712.239
all right so it's not like a social

5709.76 --> 5714.4800000000005
score situation like a status

5712.239 --> 5715.599999999999
it's just that i live on welfare

5714.48 --> 5718.32
unfortunately

5715.6 --> 5720.0
although i take minimum it's very

5718.32 --> 5722.719
important to me i know other people that

5720.0 --> 5724.88
live of welfare as well

5722.719 --> 5727.119
and but they they don't just take the

5724.88 --> 5729.4400000000005
minimum i take the minimum

5727.119 --> 5730.88
for strategic reasons too like i don't

5729.44 --> 5734.0
overstep it

5730.88 --> 5736.639
because of when you try to get more

5734.0 --> 5738.56
for whatever for like oh i have mental

5736.639 --> 5739.76
problems oh then you can get a little

5738.56 --> 5742.8
special bit

5739.76 --> 5746.4800000000005
by that but you get strings attached

5742.8 --> 5748.56
so i've just created this objective for

5746.48 --> 5749.199
myself like i have to learn how to

5748.56 --> 5752.320000000001
survive

5749.199 --> 5754.5599999999995
based on the minimum somehow and still

5752.32 --> 5755.5199999999995
eat organic that was critical to me it's

5754.56 --> 5759.04
very tough

5755.52 --> 5761.92
to figure that out how to do that

5759.04 --> 5761.92
what i've managed

5762.96 --> 5770.639
and yeah because because of the dutch

5766.56 --> 5773.4400000000005
constitution this is why i do it because

5770.639 --> 5774.32
getting that minimum the minimum social

5773.44 --> 5777.119
welfare

5774.32 --> 5778.88
is a constitutional right it's written

5777.119 --> 5780.0
in the constitution as it is in the

5778.88 --> 5783.1990000000005
netherlands

5780.0 --> 5786.32
right so i can actually

5783.199 --> 5790.159
claim it as a right and so there is

5786.32 --> 5792.5599999999995
it it's safe you see

5790.159 --> 5795.679
it's safeguarded by the constitution

5792.56 --> 5798.8
this what i'm doing

5795.679 --> 5800.32
and if i would have had more yeah i

5798.8 --> 5802.2390000000005
might have gotten a little bit more

5800.32 --> 5803.28
money but i would have gotten a lot more

5802.239 --> 5806.959999999999
issues

5803.28 --> 5806.96
that would compound over time

5807.04 --> 5813.84
bad influences potentially or nuisances

5810.239 --> 5813.839999999999
and i don't need that

5816.719 --> 5819.92
now what i've been doing on top of that

5818.8 --> 5823.4400000000005
is my show

5819.92 --> 5826.639
everything i do here to try to basically

5823.44 --> 5827.839999999999
grow from that constitutional vantage

5826.639 --> 5830.88
point and

5827.84 --> 5834.08
build up and then eventually

5830.88 --> 5836.159000000001
outgrow it without getting attached to

5834.08 --> 5837.28
some freaking system and a bunch of

5836.159 --> 5840.799999999999
contracts that

5837.28 --> 5841.44
make me do things and that i don't want

5840.8 --> 5845.679
to do

5841.44 --> 5848.799999999999
or make me lay down or never

5845.679 --> 5850.32
talk about certain beliefs again or what

5848.8 --> 5852.639
they say our beliefs

5850.32 --> 5854.639
right all that not have my opinion

5852.639 --> 5856.56
outspoken as much all that

5854.639 --> 5859.119
i've been trying to avoid that like the

5856.56 --> 5861.280000000001
plague from the start

5859.119 --> 5863.04
so that whatever i'm doing i can do it

5861.28 --> 5865.92
as me with nobody

5863.04 --> 5868.0
telling me not to do something or to do

5865.92 --> 5871.4400000000005
something and that i have to do it

5868.0 --> 5874.56
or there will be consequences

5871.44 --> 5874.5599999999995
to minimize that

5877.199 --> 5883.839999999999
what's this

5884.8 --> 5892.159000000001
ill oh

5888.08 --> 5893.679
that's disgusting dude martinioni what

5892.159 --> 5897.28
the [ __ ] is wrong with you

5893.679 --> 5899.84
stick that vaccine up your ass buddy

5897.28 --> 5902.239
that's disgusting look i'm never gonna

5899.84 --> 5906.0
take it

5902.239 --> 5909.678999999999
i'd rather die like i literally will not

5906.0 --> 5913.44
never if it's forced on me i will

5909.679 --> 5917.04
respond with lethal force lethal force

5913.44 --> 5917.678999999999
if i'm going to be forced physically to

5917.04 --> 5920.8
take that

5917.679 --> 5923.4400000000005
right lethal response

5920.8 --> 5926.08
trust me you're not going to get away

5923.44 --> 5926.08
and scarred

5926.239 --> 5930.799999999999
or maybe even alive i don't know yet

5928.8 --> 5933.119000000001
depends on what it will be but that's

5930.8 --> 5934.96
my statement so yeah not gonna take that

5933.119 --> 5936.719
you can take that though

5934.96 --> 5939.119
you can take it up your ass you wanna

5936.719 --> 5942.4800000000005
keep your precious little money

5939.119 --> 5944.48
job your convenience yeah you take that

5942.48 --> 5946.0
and keep taking it take some more take

5944.48 --> 5948.08
some more

5946.0 --> 5949.04
just pretend it's nothing pretend it's

5948.08 --> 5951.36
not there

5949.04 --> 5954.0
you get through you can just act like

5951.36 --> 5956.639
everything is all right yeah

5954.0 --> 5956.639
you take it

5959.28 --> 5962.96
if you think that you can just force

5961.28 --> 5965.5199999999995
that on people

5962.96 --> 5969.04
then why don't you try enforcing it on

5965.52 --> 5969.040000000001
me and let's see what happens

5969.119 --> 5981.839999999999
huh where's your big mouth

5989.679 --> 5995.84
yeah by the way thank you george sanford

5991.52 --> 5995.84
for spotting that

6007.679 --> 6014.56
a natural law must be written down

6010.96 --> 6014.56
what no

6015.119 --> 6022.08
it it doesn't have to be written down

6018.719 --> 6025.119
to exist

6022.08 --> 6025.92
it's not like oh if we just don't talk

6025.119 --> 6028.0
about it

6025.92 --> 6031.119
if nobody knows about it then it doesn't

6028.0 --> 6034.639
exist no no no

6031.119 --> 6037.28
but you can share

6034.639 --> 6038.08
make people aware that it exists a

6037.28 --> 6041.5199999999995
natural law

6038.08 --> 6043.6
exists that's the point it's discovered

6041.52 --> 6044.320000000001
it's a discovered part of reality you

6043.6 --> 6047.04
discover

6044.32 --> 6048.639
wait this happens always look every time

6047.04 --> 6050.56
we try to

6048.639 --> 6052.88
disprove that it happens it happens

6050.56 --> 6055.04
always

6052.88 --> 6056.88
it always happens like this and then

6055.04 --> 6060.08
just keep on

6056.88 --> 6063.36
reducing to the fundamental aspect

6060.08 --> 6064.0
like entropy like what is it really what

6063.36 --> 6066.639
is this thing

6064.0 --> 6068.32
that always happens and then it is just

6066.639 --> 6070.56
established it's figured out this

6068.32 --> 6072.239
is the natural law this is exactly what

6070.56 --> 6074.2390000000005
is happening always and it's

6072.239 --> 6076.0
applicable to everything you don't have

6074.239 --> 6079.919999999999
to write it down

6076.0 --> 6082.159
for it to exist it exists

6079.92 --> 6084.4
or it's not a natural law the natural

6082.159 --> 6086.48
law is

6084.4 --> 6087.5199999999995
it's not just because you know it is

6086.48 --> 6090.4
there it exists

6087.52 --> 6091.360000000001
no that's just becoming aware of what

6090.4 --> 6095.04
already is

6091.36 --> 6095.04
and figuring out how it is

6098.4 --> 6106.0
just because you don't know about it

6100.0 --> 6108.88
doesn't mean it doesn't exist

6106.0 --> 6110.4
that's that's real baller mystery

6108.88 --> 6112.88
religion right there

6110.4 --> 6115.36
that type of thinking that's that's

6112.88 --> 6115.36
special

6115.52 --> 6118.639
you lied one more paypal oh god those

6117.92 --> 6134.159
are the

6118.639 --> 6138.96
best type of lies thank you for that

6134.159 --> 6143.04
wow thank you man that's that is awesome

6138.96 --> 6143.04
thank you very much i really appreciate

6146.84 --> 6149.84
that

6151.76 --> 6156.4800000000005
that is awesome oh by the way that was

6154.56 --> 6158.56
interesting too

6156.48 --> 6162.638999999999
something i didn't even realize like i

6158.56 --> 6165.719
ordered the tobacco some time ago

6162.639 --> 6167.6
uh from the u.s right and it was like

6165.719 --> 6170.8
150 or something it

6167.6 --> 6173.84
seemed really expensive well i looked

6170.8 --> 6174.719
recently on like the credit card i had

6173.84 --> 6178.0
to do it through

6174.719 --> 6179.76
credit card it gets paid off immediately

6178.0 --> 6181.199
it just showed like how much it actually

6179.76 --> 6184.56
cost in euros and it

6181.199 --> 6185.919999999999
like i guess that euros are a lot more

6184.56 --> 6189.76
in the time when they bought that

6185.92 --> 6192.2390000000005
because it only was like 112

6189.76 --> 6192.88
euros instead of 150 what i thought it

6192.239 --> 6194.879999999999
was so

6192.88 --> 6196.159000000001
it turned out to be a little cheaper

6194.88 --> 6199.1990000000005
than i even expected

6196.159 --> 6201.36
that was a nice surprise too i just

6199.199 --> 6205.839999999999
noticed that this morning when i checked

6201.36 --> 6205.839999999999
but yeah

6206.639 --> 6211.28
you're awesome and all the sponsors

6208.96 --> 6213.52
you're all awesome

6211.28 --> 6217.28
you've really pulled through for me this

6213.52 --> 6220.88
year and i hope that i've been worth it

6217.28 --> 6222.32
had some really heated moments but also

6220.88 --> 6224.08
yeah it's always

6222.32 --> 6226.08
besides the heated moment there's always

6224.08 --> 6229.6
the calmer moment where it's just

6226.08 --> 6233.76
a little less eventful a little less

6229.6 --> 6235.76
vision strength kind of thing driving me

6233.76 --> 6238.0
i can't really help it it's just that

6235.76 --> 6241.119000000001
vision strength thing i can't always

6238.0 --> 6243.04
have that just ups and down it comes

6241.119 --> 6245.04
back and then it goes away again because

6243.04 --> 6245.76
if i would try to force it it wouldn't

6245.04 --> 6249.76
work

6245.76 --> 6249.76
it would start to become a smoky torch

6250.4 --> 6254.638999999999
i just have to let nature hand it over

6252.8 --> 6257.76
or nature or god

6254.639 --> 6259.4400000000005
both hand it over let it be let it

6257.76 --> 6263.1990000000005
manifest and then

6259.44 --> 6267.119
let it go away again and it'll come back

6263.199 --> 6270.159
as long as i stay pure as long as the

6267.119 --> 6273.599999999999
the bottom for that flame is still pure

6270.159 --> 6276.719
and unpoisoned viable the flame can

6273.6 --> 6278.88
just return naturally that's how i see

6276.719 --> 6278.88
it

6286.84 --> 6289.84
what

6297.679 --> 6305.36
oh god she's still knowing is subjective

6302.159 --> 6316.08
uh no

6305.36 --> 6319.119
no it's not

6316.08 --> 6323.36
i think even like the

6319.119 --> 6323.36
knowing which path experiment

6324.8 --> 6332.400000000001
even proves that it's not subjective

6329.92 --> 6334.96
it's supernatural

6332.4 --> 6335.759999999999
it's not subjective it is objective it

6334.96 --> 6341.6
is

6335.76 --> 6341.6
physically provable that it is a thing

6343.52 --> 6348.320000000001
even though it's supernatural he anyway

6346.0 --> 6351.44
it's a little complicated but

6348.32 --> 6355.5199999999995
it's not all this [ __ ] subjective

6351.44 --> 6357.919999999999
truth is subjective reality no

6355.52 --> 6359.280000000001
just because you have a subjective

6357.92 --> 6362.159
interpretation of

6359.28 --> 6362.5599999999995
things your own view your own lens your

6362.159 --> 6365.28
own

6362.56 --> 6366.2390000000005
approach doesn't mean that there that it

6365.28 --> 6369.759999999999
does not exist

6366.239 --> 6372.4
universally outside of your subjectivity

6369.76 --> 6373.280000000001
so it seems to be the claim and it's

6372.4 --> 6375.92
it's really

6373.28 --> 6378.0
just another it's a distant form of

6375.92 --> 6379.84
solipsism that's where that leads to

6378.0 --> 6381.679
it's like oh it's all subjective oh that

6379.84 --> 6384.08
means you could be ruining the jar and

6381.679 --> 6387.92
we didn't even know blah blah blah

6384.08 --> 6390.96
that's it's all nonsense it's just a big

6387.92 --> 6396.0
giant philosophical retreat maneuver

6390.96 --> 6396.0
into nothingness also known as solipsism

6396.32 --> 6401.84
yeah reality is not subjective

6402.4 --> 6406.879999999999
is real doesn't mean that you can have

6405.04 --> 6408.88
everything right about it always there's

6406.88 --> 6411.04
always more to figure out

6408.88 --> 6412.8
that doesn't mean that which you figured

6411.04 --> 6416.719
out to be

6412.8 --> 6418.4800000000005
only subjective if if something is true

6416.719 --> 6422.719
if something is real then it is

6418.48 --> 6422.718999999999
real whether you know it or not

6424.639 --> 6429.84
it is because it is

6438.08 --> 6442.08
yeah well you see fe debunker it's not

6440.56 --> 6445.4400000000005
just about

6442.08 --> 6445.84
knowing earth is flat or knowing earth

6445.44 --> 6449.199
is

6445.84 --> 6452.56
it's not you why do you know you know

6449.199 --> 6456.08
through experimentation

6452.56 --> 6458.320000000001
logic those are the devices

6456.08 --> 6461.76
we have to figure out what is real and

6458.32 --> 6465.28
what is not through empiricism

6461.76 --> 6467.52
and geometry natural consequences

6465.28 --> 6469.599999999999
optics all these things that we figured

6467.52 --> 6470.0
out in order to establish what is real

6469.6 --> 6473.360000000001
and what

6470.0 --> 6475.36
is not now if you ignore the lessons

6473.36 --> 6477.04
derived there from and start to make up

6475.36 --> 6479.92
your own versions

6477.04 --> 6480.48
then you think you can know what is real

6479.92 --> 6483.52
but you

6480.48 --> 6485.678999999999
instead you don't know you ignored

6483.52 --> 6486.719
when you ignored you think you know you

6485.679 --> 6489.92
don't you just

6486.719 --> 6493.04
ignored it and replaced it with

6489.92 --> 6494.4
your version which you don't know you

6493.04 --> 6499.84
believe it

6494.4 --> 6499.839999999999
right it's not the same thing

6501.6 --> 6508.639
no logic does not apply differently by

6505.44 --> 6512.4
logic is logic you either apply it

6508.639 --> 6515.52
or you don't either apply

6512.4 --> 6519.199
solid repeatable logic

6515.52 --> 6527.84
or you apply broken logic

6519.199 --> 6527.839999999999
this is ridiculous

6543.9 --> 6547.04
[Music]

6552.84 --> 6556.639
um

6554.04 --> 6560.08
[Music]

6556.639 --> 6564.4800000000005
like the black swan argument oh you mean

6560.08 --> 6564.48
the natural consequences of geometry

6565.44 --> 6570.239
how when there is a geometric shape

6567.84 --> 6574.88
you're looking over

6570.239 --> 6578.638999999999
at a certain scale that horizon

6574.88 --> 6581.52
suddenly is not as flexible as it were

6578.639 --> 6583.119
when you're looking over a flat plane

6581.52 --> 6585.360000000001
because when you're looking over a flat

6583.119 --> 6587.679
plane you can there's a technical direct

6585.36 --> 6589.598999999999
straight line of sight

6587.679 --> 6591.679
potentially infinite yet there is

6589.599 --> 6592.96
refraction because of atmospheric

6591.679 --> 6595.92
conditions which

6592.96 --> 6596.719
deviated causing and also angular size

6595.92 --> 6600.88
limit

6596.719 --> 6604.2390000000005
due to just seeing site itself optics

6600.88 --> 6604.2390000000005
that you can't see forever

6604.88 --> 6611.679
and thus yeah conditions in the air will

6608.8 --> 6612.88
make you be able to see much further on

6611.679 --> 6615.599
a flat plane

6612.88 --> 6617.599
at opportunities not always on the ball

6615.599 --> 6622.2390000000005
that's never going to happen

6617.599 --> 6625.92
because conditions are not going to make

6622.239 --> 6628.4
the horizon the sphere edge obstruct

6625.92 --> 6629.119
things less or more that doesn't work

6628.4 --> 6632.719
that way

6629.119 --> 6632.719
that's not how optics work

6633.599 --> 6639.119000000001
so yeah it doesn't deviate as much

6637.04 --> 6641.84
when it's actually a geometry you're

6639.119 --> 6641.839999999999
looking over

6642.08 --> 6648.8
a flat plane then just the conditions

6645.76 --> 6651.360000000001
the sight effects the mirages

6648.8 --> 6652.08
are much leave much more flexibility

6651.36 --> 6654.239
room sometimes

6652.08 --> 6655.44
it can just cut it off a lot sometimes

6654.239 --> 6658.08
you can see very far

6655.44 --> 6658.96
on a ball it doesn't matter what the

6658.08 --> 6663.599
conditions are

6658.96 --> 6665.36
far or not far the physical obstruction

6663.599 --> 6667.04
is still going to be the physical

6665.36 --> 6669.679
obstruction

6667.04 --> 6670.159
that's not going to deviate well guess

6669.679 --> 6673.599
what

6670.159 --> 6675.839999999999
in the real world the apparent distance

6673.599 --> 6676.639
to the horizon assumed to be a sphere

6675.84 --> 6680.159000000001
edge

6676.639 --> 6683.28
is highly flexible and impossibly

6680.159 --> 6685.04
flexible the geometry does not abide

6683.28 --> 6686.96
black swan that's the black swan

6685.04 --> 6689.5199999999995
argument

6686.96 --> 6691.36
it cannot be a sphere because of the

6689.52 --> 6693.1990000000005
sights that have been seen that would be

6691.36 --> 6696.4
impossible on a sphere

6693.199 --> 6697.839999999999
under every circumstances by how optics

6696.4 --> 6701.28
work

6697.84 --> 6702.639
it cannot be that it cannot be that

6701.28 --> 6705.36
sphere because

6702.639 --> 6706.719
no amount of miraging or looming or

6705.36 --> 6710.32
super looming or super

6706.719 --> 6714.32
mega looming can ever displace

6710.32 --> 6717.599
the actual horizon itself it can only

6714.32 --> 6719.199
displace sites in relation to the

6717.599 --> 6723.04
horizon

6719.199 --> 6726.879999999999
not the horizon its location

6723.04 --> 6729.119
it cannot change that and so the

6726.88 --> 6730.08
yeah when once there are sites where the

6729.119 --> 6732.08
geometry

6730.08 --> 6733.36
no longer matches this ball you see way

6732.08 --> 6736.639
too far too low

6733.36 --> 6738.08
observation height it just disproves

6736.639 --> 6740.400000000001
that it is a ball

6738.08 --> 6741.5199999999995
because it could never be visible on a

6740.4 --> 6744.719
ball

6741.52 --> 6746.56
now if it was a ball

6744.719 --> 6748.0
you would simply never see those sights

6746.56 --> 6749.52
ever because it is a physical

6748.0 --> 6750.639
impossibility because of the natural

6749.52 --> 6754.4800000000005
consequences of

6750.639 --> 6759.04
geometry and the actual in that case

6754.48 --> 6762.718999999999
sphere edge horizon obstructing things

6759.04 --> 6765.599
well it's not reality though in reality

6762.719 --> 6767.36
you can sometimes see extremely far at

6765.599 --> 6770.2390000000005
very low observation height

6767.36 --> 6770.48
and that is impossible if the earth was

6770.239 --> 6773.199
an

6770.48 --> 6774.32
actual physical geometric ball that we

6773.199 --> 6777.36
would be standing on

6774.32 --> 6779.04
and that's just that you can't get

6777.36 --> 6781.5199999999995
underneath that from underneath an

6779.04 --> 6783.92
argument it's impossible

6781.52 --> 6786.2390000000005
the earth is not a sphere it's done

6783.92 --> 6789.1990000000005
black swan

6786.239 --> 6791.44
you don't have a geometric horizon it's

6789.199 --> 6794.799999999999
only apparent

6791.44 --> 6796.4
because if it was geometric horizon then

6794.8 --> 6800.88
it would not

6796.4 --> 6800.879999999999
yield the sights we get to see

6802.0 --> 6807.76
i'm not confusing optics with

6805.84 --> 6809.04
i addressed both sides and i'm not

6807.76 --> 6811.76
confusing anything

6809.04 --> 6812.719
just because you can't follow what i'm

6811.76 --> 6814.56
saying

6812.719 --> 6815.84
because you haven't actually tried to

6814.56 --> 6817.4400000000005
figure it out because you're still

6815.84 --> 6820.56
holding onto the ball and trying to

6817.44 --> 6822.48
reify it into that ball

6820.56 --> 6824.2390000000005
yeah i can't help you not paying

6822.48 --> 6825.44
attention to what i explain i think that

6824.239 --> 6827.839999999999
everybody else here

6825.44 --> 6829.839999999999
gets what i'm trying to say could

6827.84 --> 6830.4800000000005
probably repeat it in their own way in

6829.84 --> 6832.4800000000005
chat

6830.48 --> 6835.839999999999
to confirm that they understood what i

6832.48 --> 6835.839999999999
had to say

6836.96 --> 6841.92
there is no geometric horizon yes we

6839.36 --> 6842.719
know welcome to flat earth fe debunker

6841.92 --> 6849.84
101

6842.719 --> 6849.84
welcome to flat earth we know

6851.36 --> 6854.799999999999
if the earth was a ball there would have

6853.44 --> 6857.44
to be though

6854.8 --> 6863.84
but there isn't that's right welcome to

6857.44 --> 6863.839999999999
flat earth

6872.39 --> 6875.549
[Music]

6876.56 --> 6879.52
why does the cue

6879.84 --> 6886.639
juice did you why do you think

6884.08 --> 6888.8
why do you think he uses that he uses

6886.639 --> 6891.28
that to debunk it

6888.8 --> 6892.0
natural consequence dude do you even

6891.28 --> 6895.36
understand

6892.0 --> 6895.36
logic at all

6896.239 --> 6902.239
it's just false oh if you yeah that's

6899.119 --> 6902.239
you'll see there you go

6902.56 --> 6907.1990000000005
you you have broken logic in your own

6905.599 --> 6909.4400000000005
mind

6907.199 --> 6911.919999999999
you cannot be educated further because

6909.44 --> 6915.199
you have literally

6911.92 --> 6916.56
disrupted the natural logical

6915.199 --> 6919.28
foundations

6916.56 --> 6921.04
of your own mind so we cannot have a

6919.28 --> 6923.679
discussion you are

6921.04 --> 6927.04
well you could probably be tested to be

6923.679 --> 6929.92
clinically insane at this point

6927.04 --> 6930.4
i'm not even kidding not because ball

6929.92 --> 6932.88
earth

6930.4 --> 6935.44
flatters syndrome no because you are

6932.88 --> 6937.84
literally derailing the very foundations

6935.44 --> 6942.0
of logical argumentation here

6937.84 --> 6943.76
that's a really bad form of psychosis

6942.0 --> 6945.52
that you're indulging in and you

6943.76 --> 6947.76
probably don't even realize it

6945.52 --> 6961.84
otherwise you'd feel a lot more nervous

6947.76 --> 6961.84
for saying something like that

6962.96 --> 6975.84
it's really just tragic

6984.4 --> 6988.08
you don't understand argumentation do

6986.48 --> 6990.48
you why do you think he brings

6988.08 --> 6991.84
up the geometric horizon in his flex1

6990.48 --> 6994.879999999999
argument

6991.84 --> 7003.84
why do you think he brings that up

6994.88 --> 7003.84
to disprove it idiot

7004.48 --> 7009.839999999999
you know yeah this is just dude like

7007.52 --> 7011.4400000000005
stay off the freaking drugs man like i

7009.84 --> 7012.0
don't know what you've done to yourself

7011.44 --> 7014.239
but

7012.0 --> 7016.639
you are literally not even getting the

7014.239 --> 7020.799999999999
very logical foundations of basic

7016.639 --> 7020.8
reasoning here this is really terrible

7022.239 --> 7028.799999999999
tell me i already explained it

7025.52 --> 7029.1990000000005
in the last 15 minutes every detail of

7028.8 --> 7031.92
it

7029.199 --> 7034.159
every single detail there is to be said

7031.92 --> 7036.719
i already said it about it

7034.159 --> 7038.4
but this is ridiculous you've been

7036.719 --> 7041.119
yapping on

7038.4 --> 7041.759999999999
constantly in chat i've addressed it and

7041.119 --> 7043.36
now you're

7041.76 --> 7044.96
telling me oh why didn't you tell me why

7043.36 --> 7046.88
why didn't you just freaking listen

7044.96 --> 7048.0
instead of just yapping your [ __ ]

7046.88 --> 7051.04
all the time

7048.0 --> 7053.599
i literally addressed the argument

7051.04 --> 7055.36
and the geometry and how it disproves it

7053.599 --> 7058.08
how it disproves the globe

7055.36 --> 7060.32
how you can utilize the concept of a

7058.08 --> 7064.159
geometric horizon in an argument

7060.32 --> 7066.08
to disprove the globe because of the

7064.159 --> 7068.96
natural consequences of

7066.08 --> 7073.84
when you would assume a globe the

7068.96 --> 7077.44
geometric consequences well guess what

7073.84 --> 7081.1990000000005
real views in the real world

7077.44 --> 7083.839999999999
violate that geometry

7081.199 --> 7085.199
so that geometry has been disproven

7083.84 --> 7088.8
that's basically it they

7085.199 --> 7088.799999999999
can't say it any simpler than that

7089.599 --> 7094.88
it just yeah i'm gonna round out the

7092.56 --> 7096.400000000001
show so thanks everyone for coming

because i'm still going to do my show

7139.44 --> 7142.0
then and i'm going to join the letters

7141.36 --> 7143.598999999999
debates

7142.0 --> 7146.0
which should start up any minute now

7143.599 --> 7149.04
also don't forget this evening

7146.0 --> 7151.76
in let's see
