114.36 --> 122.0
right anyway

117.42 --> 122.0
weather today is uh

122.04 --> 124.82000000000001
clouded

125.159 --> 130.64000000000001
and well it's not raining right now but

127.92 --> 130.64000000000001
it has been

134.22 --> 138.08
really does feel like it cooled off

138.2 --> 141.67999999999998
more than yesterday

141.9 --> 147.959
I'd almost put my sweater on but

145.08 --> 150.44000000000003
I thought just two T-shirts would

147.959 --> 150.44
suffice

153.36 --> 157.8
right

154.8 --> 160.68
so big clouds hovering over yesterday I

157.8 --> 163.56
had a really interesting spectacle

160.68 --> 165.59900000000002
or wasn't like really super unique it's

163.56 --> 169.28
just that the setup I

165.599 --> 169.28
was late in later in the evening

169.56 --> 174.3
uh during the fvd after show or after

172.98 --> 177.54
that I think

174.3 --> 180.36
and there was like this huge cloud

177.54 --> 182.76
like this but even bigger

180.36 --> 184.62
and it was further away

182.76 --> 187.98
that's like the Horizon was actually

184.62 --> 190.14000000000001
covered with it and

187.98 --> 194.099
snow lightning coming out of it that I

190.14 --> 196.07999999999998
saw but there was this huge rainbow

194.099 --> 199.379
and I mean big

196.08 --> 202.92000000000002
and it was like right right in front of

199.379 --> 207.01899999999998
me like I could see it if I had sat here

202.92 --> 207.01899999999998
just from there to there

207.42 --> 213.26
just staring at me

210.239 --> 213.26
that was kind of weird

217.5 --> 220.159
anyway

221.459 --> 228.42000000000002
hello Mark Collard lumpy ass and vacuum

224.159 --> 231.019
dirt 306 Richard G Beyond practical

228.42 --> 231.01899999999998
examples

231.54 --> 236.94
good to see you all Mark first in chat

234.599 --> 240.48
by the way

236.94 --> 243.48
it is Saturday the 12th 22nd of July

240.48 --> 243.48
2023

244.379 --> 249.739
and no I don't do magic tricks

252.72 --> 256.819
I Oracle oh

260.299 --> 266.12
I show the magic tricks of reality

266.34 --> 269.35999999999996
and the mind

271.38 --> 273.38
um

275.759 --> 281.90000000000003
about reading poems yeah I could do that

278.82 --> 281.9
a little but I mean

284.46 --> 290.78
there's much better ways of reading a

287.52 --> 290.78
person than their palms

293.04 --> 297.199
I'm not very good at it by the way I

294.96 --> 297.19899999999996
just

298.86 --> 303.44
I have some memories of how it works

305.94 --> 312.259
and I do realize that I always had like

308.759 --> 312.259
very bizarre lines

313.86 --> 321.259
like I had people read my poem and then

316.68 --> 321.259
give me results that are really weird

322.68 --> 325.28000000000003
like

326.16 --> 331.91900000000004
paradoxical

329.039 --> 333.36
it was just weird

331.919 --> 336.479
anyway

333.36 --> 340.1
can I read minds

336.479 --> 340.09999999999997
I can read spirits

340.139 --> 346.74
I can read frequency

343.56 --> 351.02
I can read spiritual metadata

346.74 --> 355.699
but I'm not gonna read your conscious

351.02 --> 355.69899999999996
consciously perceived active thoughts

355.979 --> 362.21999999999997
besides like lingual thoughts

359.52 --> 365.75899999999996
are like a final product they're like a

362.22 --> 368.16
third layer end result right it's much

365.759 --> 370.38
easier for me to actually read the

368.16 --> 373.32000000000005
preliminaries the drive of a person

370.38 --> 375.36
through their frequency and by their

373.32 --> 377.4
frequency determined as to where they

375.36 --> 381.38
are in life

377.4 --> 381.38
from their conscious vantage point

381.419 --> 391.15999999999997
in order to derive or divine

386.58 --> 391.15999999999997
where their light more likely to go

398.94 --> 407.039
like ghosts

401.699 --> 409.08000000000004
like ghosts well ghosts are just echoes

407.039 --> 411.65999999999997
yeah and I know we got a troll here

409.08 --> 413.46
whatever I don't give a [ __ ]

411.66 --> 416.22
I'm not afraid of those types of

413.46 --> 418.08
questions and I like they're not kooky

416.22 --> 420.24
right A lot of these trolls come here

418.08 --> 422.4
and they're like oh let's ask a cookie

420.24 --> 424.919
question and everybody knows that but

422.4 --> 427.08
I'm like yeah how about

424.919 --> 431.15999999999997
I negate

427.08 --> 433.919
your personal feeling and emotion

431.16 --> 436.199
an opinion part about it and just

433.919 --> 438.79999999999995
actually take it as serious as I can

436.199 --> 438.8
take it

441.599 --> 447.12
to reveal that all the the pettiness is

445.08 --> 448.8
really on the person's side and not even

447.12 --> 450.96
on the information

448.8 --> 453.72
they brought to the table

450.96 --> 456.73999999999995
I like doing that yeah that that's the

453.72 --> 456.74
magic that I like

460.979 --> 467.96
yeah Spirit Magic

464.58 --> 467.96
Spirit Magic Man

474.74 --> 481.34000000000003
ah anyway

477.599 --> 481.34
a lumpy gas and a vacuum

486.419 --> 492.31899999999996
slow my moon buggy whoa

489.0 --> 492.319
what he got rolling in

493.8 --> 496.88
hello moxie

504.0 --> 507.68
just went to all messages

509.819 --> 513.08
if you are gone

513.479 --> 517.62
really

514.979 --> 520.62
what what is gone

517.62 --> 522.419
I don't even I I have a top chat and a

520.62 --> 525.839
live chat I always have it set to live

522.419 --> 529.56
chat and I'm pretty sure that the chat

525.839 --> 533.1800000000001
that's on my screen over there

529.56 --> 533.18
is also live chat

533.339 --> 536.899
seems pretty synced up

542.88 --> 548.82
so look guys if you're having weird

546.36 --> 549.72
issues with your mobile interface in the

548.82 --> 552.3000000000001
chat

549.72 --> 554.76
it's a good chance that that's not

552.3 --> 557.16
because of

554.76 --> 559.2
this side it's because of the computer

557.16 --> 561.42
there's something

559.2 --> 563.6400000000001
there could be like a weird in-between

561.42 --> 565.86
program that's messing with settings and

563.64 --> 567.959
it's like erratic

565.86 --> 570.36
I suspected that there might be

567.959 --> 574.38
something like that happening in certain

570.36 --> 577.26
systems it's like interference

574.38 --> 579.24
interference from another program

577.26 --> 584.3
like a back door

579.24 --> 584.3
option to screw with people

588.54 --> 594.06
I don't know it's a bit of a

591.36 --> 596.16
bit of a conspiracy idea but

594.06 --> 597.54
it just

596.16 --> 599.5799999999999
I did

597.54 --> 601.4399999999999
you keep seeing the patterns you know

599.58 --> 603.48
and eventually you see the structures

601.44 --> 606.3000000000001
and this is one of those structures that

603.48 --> 608.76
I see I don't know if that's real but

606.3 --> 611.0
there's certainly a damn pattern going

608.76 --> 611.0
on

614.519 --> 622.4590000000001
like it's not

616.98 --> 622.4590000000001
computer random these types of things

622.62 --> 627.48
comes in waves and it seems to even

625.5 --> 630.14
correlate with the strength of energy

627.48 --> 630.14
that's around

630.48 --> 637.2
or with political agenda

634.5 --> 639.54
objectives that usually thread way

637.2 --> 641.4590000000001
outside of their actual region of

639.54 --> 644.6999999999999
Interest

641.459 --> 646.4399999999999
you start meddling with everything so it

644.7 --> 648.48
could be that they put on the censorship

646.44 --> 651.6600000000001
button and that like digs through

648.48 --> 654.5
everything to [ __ ] with you

651.66 --> 654.5
could be that

660.36 --> 668.0600000000001
or it might be a system that's

665.1 --> 668.0600000000001
I'll stop there

668.64 --> 675.48
but there's look akumo virus like can't

672.779 --> 678.06
like his account his main account is

675.48 --> 680.66
blocked on my in my chat I don't have

678.06 --> 680.66
him banned

681.3 --> 686.64
and he just can't get in I mean try to

683.519 --> 689.1
explain that my freaking thumbs up is

686.64 --> 691.62
black because I chose I clicked it black

689.1 --> 695.9590000000001
one time

691.62 --> 695.9590000000001
and now it it's not undoable

696.06 --> 702.42
it's always black now it's the only

698.459 --> 705.68
option I can do like explain that

702.42 --> 705.68
it's just [ __ ] up

708.36 --> 713.1
when's the last time Obama positive

710.519 --> 715.86
years ago

713.1 --> 718.16
that's like at least four years ago now

715.86 --> 718.16
Mark

721.26 --> 727.3199999999999
time has flown hasn't it

723.54 --> 729.66
but uh yeah no over moku I don't know I

727.32 --> 731.36
hope I don't know I don't know where it

729.66 --> 733.64
is

731.36 --> 736.98
probably just moved on

733.64 --> 736.98
[Music]

739.69 --> 743.759
[Music]

744.72 --> 747.72
foreign

767.76 --> 774.6
a bit of a dizzy moment there

770.04 --> 777.98
[Music]

774.6 --> 777.98
I feel good though

781.68 --> 786.2399999999999
but I am missing the Sun a bit I'm like

784.32 --> 789.1800000000001
feeling like ah no there's Not An Early

786.24 --> 791.4590000000001
Autumn coming is it

789.18 --> 793.4399999999999
it was said to be a pretty serious after

791.459 --> 795.18
summer I do hope that's actually coming

793.44 --> 796.62
that's not going to be like a shitty

795.18 --> 798.4799999999999
August where it's just raining all the

796.62 --> 800.279
time we used to have those like in the

798.48 --> 804.0600000000001
90s

800.279 --> 805.26
and yeah for some crops that's pretty

804.06 --> 807.899
cool

805.26 --> 810.959
I mean when that happens and we went to

807.899 --> 812.399
vacation in Spain on the East Coast a

810.959 --> 815.0999999999999
lovely ghost

812.399 --> 816.54
lovely place and we got back and it was

815.1 --> 820.5600000000001
had been that kind of weather like

816.54 --> 823.1999999999999
everything would be like immensely huge

820.56 --> 825.1999999999999
like plants would be like in berserking

823.2 --> 829.1600000000001
Crazy sized

825.2 --> 829.1600000000001
we'd be like holy [ __ ]

829.8 --> 838.019
that's like pumpkins that were like just

833.94 --> 840.3000000000001
like everything would be insanely large

838.019 --> 843.86
because of that type of weather but it's

840.3 --> 843.8599999999999
not great to actually sit through

845.279 --> 850.139
it's much more pleasant when there's

847.5 --> 853.8
just occasional rain and a lot of like

850.139 --> 856.88
nice bright Sun maybe a little fluffy

853.8 --> 856.88
clouds for the shade

859.26 --> 862.579
that's the best

862.8 --> 866.8199999999999
and it's been that kind of weather

864.18 --> 870.9799999999999
pretty much

866.82 --> 870.98
most of most of June

875.639 --> 878.12
anyway

881.12 --> 889.04
Benjamin clean pandas don't exist

884.82 --> 894.0
you might be trying to poison them oh no

889.04 --> 897.0
it's called a joke dumbass

894.0 --> 897.0
Jesus

901.079 --> 906.7199999999999
oh boys in the world like oh yes and

904.38 --> 909.26
besides like pandas are freaking weird

906.72 --> 909.26
creatures

910.32 --> 915.1990000000001
and I think that they're unnatural

912.6 --> 915.1990000000001
hybrids

919.68 --> 926.6389999999999
and there have probably been people in

923.699 --> 931.3199999999999
Panda suits acting like pandas in the

926.639 --> 933.36
zoo because Panda the the actual Wild

931.32 --> 935.82
pandas or whatever

933.36 --> 937.26
like a lot of them would hate people so

935.82 --> 939.1800000000001
they would never come out of their holes

937.26 --> 941.699
and then they'd since they were like

939.18 --> 944.459
this massive attraction massive

941.699 --> 946.3199999999999
investment in in the advertisement

944.459 --> 949.8
people would come from all over the

946.32 --> 951.899
country or all over the world even

949.8 --> 954.18
and then the pandas didn't come out was

951.899 --> 957.12
a disaster so they literally hired

954.18 --> 959.519
midgets and put Panda suits on to help

957.12 --> 961.62
to make them entertain the people nobody

959.519 --> 964.019
knew how pandas behaved anyway

961.62 --> 965.82
I think that really happened but that's

964.019 --> 968.699
separate that doesn't mean that pandas

965.82 --> 972.24
didn't exist they were there they just

968.699 --> 974.3389999999999
were lethargic and xenophobic or

972.24 --> 976.199
something they were like I'm not coming

974.339 --> 978.12
out I don't want to see other people

976.199 --> 979.56
it's like oh I'll come out when it's

978.12 --> 981.36
safe and then somebody's like looking

979.56 --> 984.54
around the corner like ah let's get back

981.36 --> 987.54
in gone like probably like that

984.54 --> 987.54
just

988.98 --> 993.779
so see

991.26 --> 997.38
right but there's no historical records

993.779 --> 999.779
of any sort about pandas in China which

997.38 --> 1002.24
is one of the oldest civilization

999.779 --> 1006.32
no references whatsoever

1002.24 --> 1009.4590000000001
since the 1900s so they are likely a

1006.32 --> 1009.4590000000001
natural hybrids

1016.22 --> 1019.94
and

1018.019 --> 1021.86
well that's not the first time that's

1019.94 --> 1026.059
happened my way I mean people have

1021.86 --> 1027.679
crossed red horses and donkeys and got

1026.059 --> 1030.02
mules out of them

1027.679 --> 1032.419
the thing though about those hybrids is

1030.02 --> 1036.02
that they are sterile

1032.419 --> 1039.0200000000002
well it might be like a sort of kind of

1036.02 --> 1042.02
unique thing that pandas still have some

1039.02 --> 1043.52
procreation ability it's just really

1042.02 --> 1047.02
small

1043.52 --> 1047.02
but it's not entirely gone

1048.319 --> 1053.26
I think that that's kind of what it is

1055.28 --> 1060.98
Owen going to ask about cubic moonric

1059.6 --> 1063.3799999999999
Moon lunch

1060.98 --> 1064.58
oh what cool quick Moon lunch what are

1063.38 --> 1067.4
you talking about

1064.58 --> 1069.9399999999998
I did hear something no no Infowars

1067.4 --> 1069.94
about that

1070.64 --> 1077.919
how's Kubrick involved are you saying

1072.98 --> 1077.919
Kubrick is involved in but he's dead

1079.22 --> 1082.96
I thought you're saying he's involved in

1081.2 --> 1085.46
the Indian moon

1082.96 --> 1088.1000000000001
mission or something

1085.46 --> 1091.52
the Owen is has talked about the moon

1088.1 --> 1093.9189999999999
landing for freaking years man

1091.52 --> 1097.94
for at least four years

1093.919 --> 1101.26
it's what got me on board his Show when

1097.94 --> 1101.26
he started talking about that

1102.559 --> 1106.52
the word spread

1104.72 --> 1110.24
in the Flat Earth

1106.52 --> 1112.16
scene a lot when he started doing that

1110.24 --> 1115.48
and he's yeah

1112.16 --> 1115.48
been watching him ever since

1129.62 --> 1132.58
okay

1133.46 --> 1138.26
Jared what are you blabbering about I

1136.16 --> 1139.64
mean having a lot of trouble trying to

1138.26 --> 1141.8799999999999
follow what the hell you're talking

1139.64 --> 1141.88
about

1144.799 --> 1147.52
uh

1148.64 --> 1153.74
fairies yeah yeah yeah lumpy gas in the

1151.28 --> 1157.1789999999999
vacuum yeah yeah that's right

1153.74 --> 1157.179
that's a funny one isn't it

1162.799 --> 1167.059
retract it what what what's going on

1165.38 --> 1169.3400000000001
here

1167.059 --> 1171.52
why would they make pandas because they

1169.34 --> 1171.52
could

1171.86 --> 1178.8999999999999
and because they probably were trying to

1174.98 --> 1178.9
prove things concerning evolution

1178.94 --> 1182.539
right

1180.44 --> 1184.5800000000002
they I think they did a lot of

1182.539 --> 1187.58
cross-breeding attempts

1184.58 --> 1191.8999999999999
if I remember correctly it was either on

1187.58 --> 1194.539
Martin Luther but probably more uh

1191.9 --> 1196.16
mine unveiled that had a video yeah I

1194.539 --> 1199.28
think was mine unveiled because much

1196.16 --> 1200.419
more ordered presentations not random

1199.28 --> 1201.86
nonsense

1200.419 --> 1203.72
but

1201.86 --> 1205.9399999999998
reminder Phil had a video it was a long

1203.72 --> 1209.1200000000001
time ago older video

1205.94 --> 1211.4
where I explained how there was a time

1209.12 --> 1213.3799999999999
where there were a lot of hybrids

1211.4 --> 1216.919
and there's even like

1213.38 --> 1220.8400000000001
uh not photographs but like

1216.919 --> 1220.8400000000001
sketches of them pictures

1221.539 --> 1228.64
and it was part of the whole museum

1225.5 --> 1232.1
Trend right Evolution

1228.64 --> 1234.7990000000002
digging up dinosaurs supposedly making

1232.1 --> 1238.8799999999999
them out of granite chicken bones

1234.799 --> 1241.82
right and cross breeding because that

1238.88 --> 1244.4
would I mean if you're a darwinian

1241.82 --> 1247.52
evolutionist proponent and you want to

1244.4 --> 1249.2
try to prove it well a go-to would be

1247.52 --> 1253.48
like yeah but

1249.2 --> 1253.48
it's all originating from the same

1253.94 --> 1259.7
species or a lot of it so you can cross

1256.46 --> 1262.52
breed it and like an F Evolution would

1259.7 --> 1263.9
naturally make that happen it's like to

1262.52 --> 1266.6
prove a case

1263.9 --> 1268.7
they probably originally with attempts

1266.6 --> 1272.48
of hybrid hybridizing they wanted to

1268.7 --> 1274.16
prove a case that oh Evolution yeah it

1272.48 --> 1276.559
just happens and

1274.16 --> 1279.98
and potentially something Superior comes

1276.559 --> 1283.7
out of it but then all of it was not

1279.98 --> 1286.22
Superior could not procreate and the pen

1283.7 --> 1288.8600000000001
that was probably like the only species

1286.22 --> 1291.32
out of those attempts that was able to

1288.86 --> 1293.1789999999999
procreate a very little amount so it was

1291.32 --> 1295.6399999999999
their pride case

1293.179 --> 1297.0800000000002
see see how it now starts to fit

1295.64 --> 1298.7
logically

1297.08 --> 1301.3999999999999
I think that that's how it happened

1298.7 --> 1303.74
there it was part of a big project I'm

1301.4 --> 1308.48
animal hybridization

1303.74 --> 1311.24
in an attempt to prove evolution

1308.48 --> 1314.179
but then they all became sterile and or

1311.24 --> 1315.919
died very early because it was unnatural

1314.179 --> 1319.48
but the panda was like the only thing

1315.919 --> 1319.48
that somehow was able to

1320.36 --> 1326.6
to maintain existing and procreating

1323.6 --> 1329.36
to some degree

1326.6 --> 1331.52
and so it was their pride case and it's

1329.36 --> 1333.74
not surprising that it's been made into

1331.52 --> 1337.46
this

1333.74 --> 1341.36
bright case right uh

1337.46 --> 1344.48
the the symbol for the WWF

1341.36 --> 1347.12
like it's a prided animal of China like

1344.48 --> 1351.559
it's been put on a pedestal

1347.12 --> 1355.299
because it was probably an early part of

1351.559 --> 1355.299
trying to improve evolution

1360.02 --> 1367.059
so that's my fully worked out conception

1363.98 --> 1367.059
concerning the panda

1377.78 --> 1381.46
so is that all cleared up now

1397.84 --> 1401.3799999999999
transubstantiate calcium

1404.659 --> 1410.0
what

1406.86 --> 1410.0
[Music]

1417.679 --> 1422.5
I I don't know what just what do you

1420.26 --> 1422.5
mean

1424.58 --> 1432.58
what is trans substantiate

1429.679 --> 1432.5800000000002
does that mean

1433.22 --> 1438.76
I can guess

1436.34 --> 1438.76
what

1440.679 --> 1445.76
Christian theological terminology

1444.919 --> 1450.26
um

1445.76 --> 1450.26
probably literally literary

1450.38 --> 1453.3400000000001
convert

1455.24 --> 1457.659
what

1459.38 --> 1464.48
what change the form of a substance into

1461.78 --> 1468.08
something different

1464.48 --> 1470.9
you mean transmute okay how the hell do

1468.08 --> 1473.6589999999999
they do that but I mean there's a lot of

1470.9 --> 1476.26
chemical processes that go on in the

1473.659 --> 1476.2600000000002
body though

1477.86 --> 1481.36
lumpic acid in a vacuum

1481.82 --> 1485.1789999999999
I mean

1483.08 --> 1488.24
your body can literally fabric there's

1485.179 --> 1490.7800000000002
like stuff in vegetables

1488.24 --> 1493.7
that your body your liver like

1490.78 --> 1495.62
reconstructs into other stuff

1493.7 --> 1498.28
all the time

1495.62 --> 1498.28
so

1503.059 --> 1505.78
I don't know

1516.799 --> 1522.5
he fought hard model what what does that

1519.5 --> 1524.779
have to do with evolution

1522.5 --> 1526.76
why would minerals like calcium be

1524.779 --> 1528.26
finite according to evolute what the

1526.76 --> 1529.1589999999999
hell does that have to do with it with

1528.26 --> 1531.8799999999999
it

1529.159 --> 1531.88
that's weird

1545.419 --> 1550.94
right but I mean yeah life can actually

1548.24 --> 1555.5
transform matter

1550.94 --> 1558.1000000000001
on the cellular level like biologically

1555.5 --> 1562.159
we are like chemical refineries

1558.1 --> 1564.6789999999999
technically our bodies are

1562.159 --> 1567.74
pretty high level too

1564.679 --> 1570.4
and a lot of animals are

1567.74 --> 1570.4
I mean

1572.0 --> 1578.539
here's the thing and this is some this

1574.64 --> 1581.6000000000001
is like almost theological I guess but

1578.539 --> 1583.279
my healer says that really at the core

1581.6 --> 1586.58
of it

1583.279 --> 1589.58
we don't actually need food

1586.58 --> 1592.6399999999999
like Tech well a bit of it

1589.58 --> 1594.799
because if you're like really pure and

1592.64 --> 1596.6000000000001
really like anchored in your body and

1594.799 --> 1599.059
you got everything healed up and you're

1596.6 --> 1601.8799999999999
doing everything right

1599.059 --> 1605.6
like being with God actually like in

1601.88 --> 1607.88
your ways then and and animals can have

1605.6 --> 1610.34
like if they're not traumatized they're

1607.88 --> 1612.2600000000002
functioning properly and naturally they

1610.34 --> 1615.4599999999998
have a two that

1612.26 --> 1618.919
like somehow you could say the spirit

1615.46 --> 1622.48
uses the body to literally

1618.919 --> 1622.48
cause transmutation

1626.779 --> 1633.26
that in high function your body Beyond

1630.1 --> 1634.52
rudimentary chemical transformation like

1633.26 --> 1636.98
in the liver

1634.52 --> 1639.44
the Chica literally like

1636.98 --> 1643.84
just create

1639.44 --> 1643.8400000000001
things that you need out of nothing

1644.6 --> 1650.24
or out of something else that normally

1647.12 --> 1652.76
you wouldn't be able to do that in a in

1650.24 --> 1655.76
a chemical laboratory it's like life can

1652.76 --> 1657.919
actually transmutate

1655.76 --> 1661.52
things

1657.919 --> 1664.4
it's bizarre but he said that I do

1661.52 --> 1667.52
believe it I don't think I'm

1664.4 --> 1669.2
like gonna be to that level maybe in the

1667.52 --> 1671.86
end but I mean

1669.2 --> 1671.8600000000001
poof

1672.2 --> 1678.279
but as a conception yes I find that very

1675.559 --> 1678.279
much acceptable

1679.4 --> 1685.76
the dynamic of life is freaking surreal

1683.059 --> 1688.3999999999999
and especially when the spirit is right

1685.76 --> 1692.419
when the spirit is right it's like the

1688.4 --> 1695.26
dynamic of the body almost becomes

1692.419 --> 1695.26
mystical

1695.779 --> 1700.76
no wonder people would call it being

1698.72 --> 1703.4
with God and like

1700.76 --> 1706.8799999999999
if you do it right then suddenly it's

1703.4 --> 1708.44
almost like you become a piece of God

1706.88 --> 1711.3200000000002
because

1708.44 --> 1715.3600000000001
the things that you can do and that your

1711.32 --> 1715.36
body does is just surreal

1720.02 --> 1726.44
when you're in Peak energy

1723.26 --> 1728.179
and you're guided properly and you're

1726.44 --> 1730.039
like growing and you're starting to

1728.179 --> 1731.659
overlook

1730.039 --> 1734.86
everything

1731.659 --> 1734.8600000000001
and your own life

1737.84 --> 1742.4099999999999
anyway

1738.71 --> 1742.41
[Music]

1747.62 --> 1754.2199999999998
no food status Purity well it would be

1750.26 --> 1754.22
defined as breatharianism

1757.279 --> 1762.1
which is technically a risky endeavor

1763.58 --> 1766.0
because

1768.08 --> 1774.86
it's really hard to basically start

1772.52 --> 1777.2
saying it theologically to get all the

1774.86 --> 1779.9189999999999
sin out of you in order to actually be

1777.2 --> 1779.919
able to do it

1781.94 --> 1787.3990000000001
because if you're like pushing for it

1784.34 --> 1789.3799999999999
like no I gotta do it but you're not

1787.399 --> 1792.2199999999998
succeeding well then you literally

1789.38 --> 1792.22
starve yourself

1792.279 --> 1798.5
right it's

1795.62 --> 1800.6
it's risky and should definitely not

1798.5 --> 1803.74
breatharianism is not like a cheap

1800.6 --> 1803.74
solution or something

1803.779 --> 1809.419
as a like as a cult solution like no no

1807.14 --> 1811.88
that would just get you killed no no no

1809.419 --> 1814.88
it's

1811.88 --> 1818.659
it's at best it's like a cherry on top

1814.88 --> 1822.5
of your life that you're able to do that

1818.659 --> 1825.5590000000002
it should not be like considered as

1822.5 --> 1829.539
something that could just be normalized

1825.559 --> 1832.399
in this world there's just no way

1829.539 --> 1834.26
everything would like

1832.399 --> 1836.12
that could only work if there were no

1834.26 --> 1839.6589999999999
Grabbers

1836.12 --> 1841.399
at at all then that could happen but I

1839.659 --> 1842.96
mean that's not how this world Works

1841.399 --> 1843.7399999999998
currently

1842.96 --> 1845.1000000000001
um

1843.74 --> 1846.38
anyway

1845.1 --> 1849.5
[Music]

1846.38 --> 1851.179
I got Illuminati Castle I'm gonna take a

1849.5 --> 1852.99
bite of that

1851.179 --> 1854.72
gusto

1852.99 --> 1857.98
[Music]

1854.72 --> 1857.98
and take a sip of that

1859.159 --> 1861.8200000000002
cheers

1866.299 --> 1873.399
yeah by the way before the show

1869.24 --> 1873.3990000000001
is watching another Paul Cook stream

1873.919 --> 1879.44
so freaking fascinating dude

1877.279 --> 1880.46
like he's walking around on the coast of

1879.44 --> 1884.98
Malta

1880.46 --> 1884.98
and just showing all these casts

1885.2 --> 1891.14
geopolymergic

1887.659 --> 1893.2990000000002
Limestone based cast stuff with even

1891.14 --> 1896.179
like pieces of

1893.299 --> 1899.179
iron plating and you could just see how

1896.179 --> 1902.659
the different layers

1899.179 --> 1905.0590000000002
are there it's amazing like that was a

1902.659 --> 1908.0
great video you got a bit cooked by the

1905.059 --> 1910.399
way by the sun I think you should

1908.0 --> 1911.84
probably have like a good hat with him

1910.399 --> 1914.799
the next time because he could get a

1911.84 --> 1914.799
heat stroke there man

1915.799 --> 1918.82
but uh

1919.82 --> 1923.36
yeah that was very interesting and it

1921.86 --> 1925.58
reminds me because

1923.36 --> 1927.1999999999998
on the east coast of Spain where I've

1925.58 --> 1930.02
been a lot

1927.2 --> 1934.279
like at the beaches there there is Rock

1930.02 --> 1937.52
like that too it's very much like that

1934.279 --> 1939.98
it's more withered perhaps but you could

1937.52 --> 1941.779
just see it like this

1939.98 --> 1944.14
there's something really weird about

1941.779 --> 1944.14
this

1945.02 --> 1948.7
and iron plates

1949.76 --> 1956.779
iron plates just in the middle of a rock

1953.779 --> 1959.899
a big lumpy Rock that's like sticking

1956.779 --> 1962.36
out like a thumb or something right next

1959.899 --> 1965.12
to other rocks that's like a typical

1962.36 --> 1967.1
Beach that I've been at a lot or in that

1965.12 --> 1969.559
rock there I've climbed that thing a lot

1967.1 --> 1971.6
because it's like one side one little

1969.559 --> 1973.6399999999999
side it's just the sand and the rest is

1971.6 --> 1976.1
all water around so it's like a great

1973.64 --> 1977.1200000000001
thing to climb on and jump off in the

1976.1 --> 1978.5
ocean

1977.12 --> 1980.059
right

1978.5 --> 1982.88
but

1980.059 --> 1985.22
that thing had like metal plates

1982.88 --> 1987.8600000000001
freaking everywhere

1985.22 --> 1989.48
like just in the rocks and sometimes

1987.86 --> 1992.36
sticking out you could even like break

1989.48 --> 1994.34
little pieces of rust off it like that

1992.36 --> 1996.86
it's crazy

1994.34 --> 1999.5
and just seeing Paul Cook talk about

1996.86 --> 2001.4189999999999
that stuff and showing something that's

1999.5 --> 2004.299
so similar I'm just thinking like man

2001.419 --> 2007.539
that thing is a construct what the hell

2004.299 --> 2011.76
was that what's that okay

2007.539 --> 2011.76
a tower or something at one point

2012.82 --> 2016.779
like why is that thing sticking out

2015.279 --> 2019.6
there

2016.779 --> 2022.24
I'm just really curious now

2019.6 --> 2025.12
because I do think that

2022.24 --> 2028.779
there's a good chance that very far back

2025.12 --> 2030.039
in history the entire Mediterranean had

2028.779 --> 2034.32
been like

2030.039 --> 2034.32
the coast had been crafted

2034.96 --> 2040.5
like I think that a lot of the of the

2038.019 --> 2040.5
coast

2040.72 --> 2048.2200000000003
of the Mediterranean has been crafted

2043.299 --> 2050.32
like giant cast fortresses perhaps

2048.22 --> 2052.9599999999996
that were like everywhere it's probably

2050.32 --> 2055.2400000000002
during the Byzantine Empire since they

2052.96 --> 2056.919
were really all about that ocean and

2055.24 --> 2058.5989999999997
having control over it it's a good

2056.919 --> 2061.1389999999997
likelihood that they built that

2058.599 --> 2061.139
everywhere

2061.48 --> 2067.3
but it's so fascinating

2064.78 --> 2069.76
because I also have well I just have

2067.3 --> 2070.96
these memories from like 30 years ago

2069.76 --> 2075.0400000000004
and plus

2070.96 --> 2077.26
of litch yeah yeah 30 years ago of

2075.04 --> 2080.859
literally being at such a place as Paul

2077.26 --> 2083.44
Cook is now studying where he is at

2080.859 --> 2085.54
so it really brings me back

2083.44 --> 2087.58
makes me think I really want to go back

2085.54 --> 2091.379
there someday

2087.58 --> 2091.379
like what I'm with my wife

2094.179 --> 2098.5
or girlfriend

2096.52 --> 2101.82
my fur I went there with my first

2098.5 --> 2101.82
girlfriend and my third

2102.46 --> 2105.18
was awesome

2106.62 --> 2110.74
[Music]

2107.74 --> 2110.74
huh

2111.7 --> 2116.2
it's it was just like a family thing

2113.8 --> 2117.6400000000003
that we did like you go there with the

2116.2 --> 2119.6189999999997
family and then you meet the other

2117.64 --> 2122.2599999999998
families

2119.619 --> 2123.7000000000003
and their kids by now they have families

2122.26 --> 2125.7400000000002
of their own it's a good likelihood that

2123.7 --> 2128.9199999999996
they're coming there as well and they'd

2125.74 --> 2131.02
probably if I come there now they during

2128.92 --> 2132.7000000000003
a summer vacation here so that yeah that

2131.02 --> 2135.7599999999998
is roughly around now they would

2132.7 --> 2138.5989999999997
probably recognize me like hey Paul

2135.76 --> 2138.599
is that you

2142.06 --> 2147.04
and I probably

2143.98 --> 2148.96
would recognize them too

2147.04 --> 2150.94
but they would be older and all that

2148.96 --> 2152.98
anyway yeah

2150.94 --> 2155.82
I wonder if they've kept the tradition

2152.98 --> 2155.82
of going there

2155.98 --> 2160.66
a lot of them had for like

2158.68 --> 2163.0
for Generations

2160.66 --> 2165.46
that camping had been around for a long

2163.0 --> 2169.66
time it was like a farmer that basically

2165.46 --> 2173.579
added camping on the side of his farm

2169.66 --> 2173.5789999999997
so yeah pretty damn based

2176.26 --> 2181.78
although he was not an organic farmer

2178.78 --> 2184.5400000000004
and [ __ ] I I wonder if he's actually he

2181.78 --> 2187.48
has a good chances

2184.54 --> 2190.839
I think the guy actually died and his

2187.48 --> 2193.3
son's inherited it

2190.839 --> 2195.52
I wonder if they'd be smart enough to

2193.3 --> 2197.1400000000003
try like to take it the farm into an

2195.52 --> 2199.0
organic direction if that's even

2197.14 --> 2201.5989999999997
possible there I mean it is a very dry

2199.0 --> 2201.599
region

2201.76 --> 2206.2000000000003
but anyway

2203.8 --> 2207.98
these are all questions I could ask them

2206.2 --> 2214.8999999999996
if I ever go back there

2207.98 --> 2218.32
[Music]

2214.9 --> 2223.14
and I would also like the attempt to see

2218.32 --> 2223.1400000000003
if how did it feel about Flat Earth

2228.22 --> 2233.5789999999997
was the last time

2229.9 --> 2233.579
summer vacation huh

2236.32 --> 2241.98
well that would be my third girlfriend

2239.5 --> 2245.56
Jesus that's

2241.98 --> 2247.839
22 years ago

2245.56 --> 2250.839
I mean I went to

2247.839 --> 2254.2599999999998
to Germany during Springtime a couple of

2250.839 --> 2257.14
times with my ex wave coffee and that

2254.26 --> 2258.2200000000003
was sort of like a summer vacation very

2257.14 --> 2260.5
early

2258.22 --> 2264.359
but I mean yeah the actual summer

2260.5 --> 2264.359
vacation yeah that's a long time ago

2269.38 --> 2274.78
but it's also because I really don't

2272.14 --> 2276.7
want to do such a thing alone

2274.78 --> 2278.2000000000003
like

2276.7 --> 2279.5789999999997
there's some people out there they're

2278.2 --> 2282.5789999999997
like yeah you go out in your own

2279.579 --> 2286.98
adventure in a wild country you've never

2282.579 --> 2286.98
been or whatever oh yeah exciting yeah

2289.3 --> 2293.099
that's not gonna be my thing

2293.26 --> 2297.94
like not alone

2295.48 --> 2300.88
no way I'm not gonna go at somewhere

2297.94 --> 2306.0
alone like way outside of my living

2300.88 --> 2306.0
region just not doing that not a lot

2310.24 --> 2314.2
and weird also because it is kind of

2312.7 --> 2317.6189999999997
like a

2314.2 --> 2319.66
a maybe like a fair thing

2317.619 --> 2320.92
it's like I'd feel too vulnerable just

2319.66 --> 2323.2
being alone

2320.92 --> 2324.82
and the funny thing is if I go with a

2323.2 --> 2326.859
girlfriend

2324.82 --> 2329.619
or wife or whatever

2326.859 --> 2332.44
then I wouldn't feel like that I'd feel

2329.619 --> 2334.54
much safer weird isn't it but you know

2332.44 --> 2336.64
why that is it's because I suddenly have

2334.54 --> 2339.2799999999997
a protection role and that protection

2336.64 --> 2341.44
role is always activated and that makes

2339.28 --> 2344.619
it feel more safe because I wouldn't

2341.44 --> 2346.92
just be able to feign that fake that on

2344.619 --> 2346.92
my own

2348.22 --> 2352.7799999999997
so it's because of the social

2350.079 --> 2355.6800000000003
circumstances I feel better equipped to

2352.78 --> 2355.6800000000003
doing that then

2356.38 --> 2359.46
thank you

2359.7 --> 2363.64
and that's why I don't like to go on

2362.02 --> 2366.339
vacation alone

2363.64 --> 2368.339
that

2366.339 --> 2368.339
um

2396.96 --> 2403.359
contain you was

2400.359 --> 2403.359
continuous

2406.359 --> 2409.2599999999998
what does that mean

2411.28 --> 2417.46
I've never seen no contagious but

2415.06 --> 2420.46
teachers

2417.46 --> 2424.599
sharing a corner and touching extra

2420.46 --> 2424.599
together in sequence contiguous

2425.74 --> 2428.3999999999996
is there

2433.119 --> 2435.599
okay

2436.14 --> 2441.48
that's so weird I've never heard that

2438.94 --> 2441.48
word before

2443.74 --> 2451.4399999999996
it looks like a really high classy work

2447.52 --> 2451.44
huh I've never heard it before

2456.46 --> 2459.48
that's just crazy

2462.7 --> 2465.4199999999996
huh

2467.56 --> 2471.18
it's a 20 word

2486.4 --> 2491.1600000000003
hello by the way Godzilla

2488.38 --> 2491.1600000000003
good to see you

2502.24 --> 2505.24
right

2509.76 --> 2515.1400000000003
any responses to my show yesterday I

2512.74 --> 2516.8199999999997
mean I did do like a weird Ballwin thing

2515.14 --> 2519.0989999999997
again

2516.82 --> 2521.6400000000003
it's literally called how to fake a new

2519.099 --> 2521.6400000000003
moon landing

2522.22 --> 2526.2999999999997
obviously that's the [ __ ] that you find

2524.5 --> 2527.38
on my channel like

2526.3 --> 2531.46
call

2527.38 --> 2534.94
name me another person on the internet

2531.46 --> 2538.359
that does something like that

2534.94 --> 2541.119
be honest like any person out there in

2538.359 --> 2543.54
media that does something like what I

2541.119 --> 2543.54
did yesterday

2568.06 --> 2574.72
right by the way I got into a bit of an

2570.4 --> 2578.2000000000003
argument at the last moment yeah after

2574.72 --> 2581.68
after show hangout with like Adam and

2578.2 --> 2584.68
chocolate and Saiyan and

2581.68 --> 2587.74
uh refracted curvature

2584.68 --> 2588.819
I was doing like a Del win this is a new

2587.74 --> 2591.4599999999996
thing

2588.819 --> 2595.42
not gonna hang on to it too much

2591.46 --> 2598.48
but yeah it's me arguing for how

2595.42 --> 2600.76
the upwards Rising Earth concept is

2598.48 --> 2603.76
supposed to be working because I'm

2600.76 --> 2606.3390000000004
constantly just getting so agitated from

2603.76 --> 2608.26
Dell making stupid assertions that are

2606.339 --> 2609.819
just incorrect about it

2608.26 --> 2612.7000000000003
like

2609.819 --> 2617.04
it's like my my creative side is getting

2612.7 --> 2617.04
really offended by Dell's [ __ ] around

2618.76 --> 2624.28
and so I've kind of started doing that

2621.64 --> 2625.91
it's crazy but I mean hey what did you

2624.28 --> 2628.9
expect it's me

2625.91 --> 2631.18
[Music]

2628.9 --> 2634.02
and Baldwin is kind of normal now so

2631.18 --> 2634.02
it's almost like

2635.98 --> 2640.2
like when I do that it doesn't even

2637.96 --> 2642.7
surprise people anymore

2640.2 --> 2644.3799999999997
it's just like oh yeah let's stay on the

2642.7 --> 2647.98
side it's like oh yeah that's just the

2644.38 --> 2649.2400000000002
Devil he's on our side now it's weird

2647.98 --> 2652.66
but

2649.24 --> 2655.5989999999997
Bowen is weird it's weird to me because

2652.66 --> 2657.0989999999997
of what happens in my actual spirit and

2655.599 --> 2661.1800000000003
Consciousness when that happened it's

2657.099 --> 2663.339
weird because it's it becomes real

2661.18 --> 2665.56
it's like I have actual suspense of

2663.339 --> 2668.2
disbelief when that happens it's it and

2665.56 --> 2670.9
you have to be careful with yourself

2668.2 --> 2673.24
because it can go wrong and when it kind

2670.9 --> 2674.319
of went wrong yesterday when I did Del

2673.24 --> 2675.819
win

2674.319 --> 2679.839
because

2675.819 --> 2682.839
yeah I was trying to argue like no the

2679.839 --> 2686.319
model is absolutely sound it is

2682.839 --> 2688.66
it's just absolutely unprovable on top

2686.319 --> 2691.06
of it like because

2688.66 --> 2693.339
I've said it so many times I tried to

2691.06 --> 2695.5
argue it and they were saying like yeah

2693.339 --> 2698.14
but what's a what's keeping the cloud

2695.5 --> 2700.359
where it is like I try to explain they

2698.14 --> 2702.64
just rump us over me every time so I got

2700.359 --> 2705.0989999999997
so [ __ ] pissed off

2702.64 --> 2707.339
just tell them to go [ __ ] themselves and

2705.099 --> 2707.339
left

2707.8 --> 2713.6800000000003
because I do think that the guys

2710.68 --> 2715.48
sometimes they get yeah you could say

2713.68 --> 2717.0989999999997
I'm projecting a bit I do get over

2715.48 --> 2719.92
fanatical but they too get over

2717.099 --> 2722.7400000000002
fanatical and it actually makes them

2719.92 --> 2724.839
lose insight

2722.74 --> 2726.2799999999997
because they're just too preoccupied

2724.839 --> 2729.339
with

2726.28 --> 2732.0400000000004
with just crushing down the opposition

2729.339 --> 2736.119
of the argument

2732.04 --> 2738.16
and then they they don't actually look

2736.119 --> 2741.04
that carefully they it's like they lose

2738.16 --> 2743.92
their patience they just think that the

2741.04 --> 2746.079
opposition in this case Delwin is just

2743.92 --> 2748.66
trying to get to them I'm not

2746.079 --> 2751.1800000000003
like just like when I'm bowing I'm not

2748.66 --> 2754.18
trying to get to people

2751.18 --> 2756.16
like I'm not correct you know how that

2754.18 --> 2758.02
goes I'm not that demon side I'm

2756.16 --> 2759.94
actually sticking to the argumentation

2758.02 --> 2763.18
when I do Bowen

2759.94 --> 2765.42
right and so for Delwin and it's just

2763.18 --> 2765.4199999999996
like

2766.359 --> 2770.98
the guys can't handle it

2768.4 --> 2773.26
they get triggered it's like I do the

2770.98 --> 2775.2400000000002
simulation too well they get so sucked

2773.26 --> 2778.599
into it that it's almost like they're

2775.24 --> 2780.7
reliving the actual thing

2778.599 --> 2782.5
and then they respond to me as if I were

2780.7 --> 2785.14
a Dell that had done all those things

2782.5 --> 2787.42
when I'm not doing those things and then

2785.14 --> 2788.5
end up in those [ __ ] situations it's

2787.42 --> 2791.319
like

2788.5 --> 2793.359
the things I do are kind of magical and

2791.319 --> 2795.819
surreal and it just

2793.359 --> 2797.859
I don't know it accidentally [ __ ] with

2795.819 --> 2800.859
people's minds I think

2797.859 --> 2803.68
even the friend my friends

2800.859 --> 2805.74
but it it does agitate me because a lot

2803.68 --> 2808.54
of times I'm like hello could you please

2805.74 --> 2812.5789999999997
not be weak

2808.54 --> 2812.579
and just shut the [ __ ] up

2813.76 --> 2820.1800000000003
when I'm getting angry in a conversation

2816.599 --> 2823.3590000000004
that means stop it

2820.18 --> 2826.0
that doesn't mean that oh no you don't

2823.359 --> 2828.819
have a good I when I get angry I always

2826.0 --> 2830.26
have a [ __ ] good reason for becoming

2828.819 --> 2834.599
angry

2830.26 --> 2834.599
and if you don't know that by now

2835.359 --> 2839.94
then you're literally not paying any

2837.52 --> 2839.94
attention

2841.72 --> 2849.22
like you're being very sloppy

2845.079 --> 2853.38
as a friend interacting with me

2849.22 --> 2853.3799999999997
because I don't normally get angry

2857.38 --> 2862.7200000000003
I mean guys if somebody you're having a

2860.859 --> 2864.5789999999997
conversation a discussion right in some

2862.72 --> 2866.0789999999997
guy and he's like okay

2864.579 --> 2869.98
uh

2866.079 --> 2873.6400000000003
please don't interrupt me because I lose

2869.98 --> 2876.099
like that ruins it then it's difficult

2873.64 --> 2877.96
for me to express this and they're gonna

2876.099 --> 2880.0
say something and they say something and

2877.96 --> 2882.099
you perceive things that are wrong about

2880.0 --> 2884.56
it right

2882.099 --> 2886.599
so are you then going to hammer them

2884.56 --> 2887.859
every second about the thing you know is

2886.599 --> 2890.02
wrong about it

2887.859 --> 2892.06
and then they lose complete track of the

2890.02 --> 2895.18
whole thing and you basically [ __ ] it

2892.06 --> 2898.06
up for them did you do a good thing oh I

2895.18 --> 2900.5789999999997
just held it in tracks or did you just

2898.06 --> 2902.319
disrupt something based on an obvious

2900.579 --> 2905.619
thing

2902.319 --> 2907.839
that's not [ __ ] relevant

2905.619 --> 2909.4
because you don't understand the entire

2907.839 --> 2912.22
process they're doing

2909.4 --> 2913.48
right you could have just let it all

2912.22 --> 2915.7599999999998
roll out

2913.48 --> 2918.42
and then afterwards see how their

2915.76 --> 2920.8590000000004
conception could perhaps still work

2918.42 --> 2923.14
missing that one element that they

2920.859 --> 2927.04
rolled in there and you could just

2923.14 --> 2928.66
explain it to them instead of I'm gonna

2927.04 --> 2930.339
discontinue what you're saying because

2928.66 --> 2932.319
you did that one [ __ ] thing wrong

2930.339 --> 2935.22
yeah yeah

2932.319 --> 2939.579
maybe you could not be a [ __ ]

2935.22 --> 2941.02
Barbarian about information

2939.579 --> 2944.2000000000003
sometimes

2941.02 --> 2946.72
and I'm also addressing Nathan about

2944.2 --> 2949.68
this because I really do think that in

2946.72 --> 2953.2599999999998
his debating he goes too hard it's like

2949.68 --> 2956.0789999999997
unnecessarily violent

2953.26 --> 2957.7000000000003
and yes that's how you win technically

2956.079 --> 2961.0
every time

2957.7 --> 2964.24
but it's excessive

2961.0 --> 2968.079
and it does immediately like force the

2964.24 --> 2970.4199999999996
opponent to get dirty and dark

2968.079 --> 2972.7000000000003
because the or you run away and then

2970.42 --> 2975.2200000000003
feel really [ __ ] miserable because

2972.7 --> 2976.839
you've just been bullied because that is

2975.22 --> 2979.2999999999997
what happens then

2976.839 --> 2984.18
right yeah it's about winning

2979.3 --> 2984.1800000000003
but I mean your life is not on the line

2986.38 --> 2993.94
if you don't immediately slaughter them

2991.0 --> 2996.04
so I think that Nathan is just excessive

2993.94 --> 2998.02
sometimes and

2996.04 --> 3000.48
I'm not gonna complain about it even

2998.02 --> 3001.859
it's like it's pointless like during the

3000.48 --> 3003.839
show there's no [ __ ] point

3001.859 --> 3005.7599999999998
complaining about it I'm just saying it

3003.839 --> 3009.359
right now when it's not happening so

3005.76 --> 3010.98
that Nathan isn't in the middle of it

3009.359 --> 3012.359
because then he doesn't [ __ ] listen

3010.98 --> 3015.0
to that sort of thing he's not gonna

3012.359 --> 3018.0
listen to like oh I don't take it easy

3015.0 --> 3020.339
no he's gonna just like emphasize and no

3018.0 --> 3022.5
I'm just gonna kill just kill just kill

3020.339 --> 3024.839
don't leave them any room just kills

3022.5 --> 3027.96
like yeah yeah

3024.839 --> 3030.24
maybe it's like PTSD or something maybe

3027.96 --> 3033.18
he is really stuck in the arena and he

3030.24 --> 3037.0789999999997
just can't get out of that mode

3033.18 --> 3039.7799999999997
because it's not always necessary

3037.079 --> 3042.1800000000003
and if you do that yeah you win and you

3039.78 --> 3045.9
get a predictable outcome but you also

3042.18 --> 3048.66
always like unnecessarily

3045.9 --> 3050.88
pull the dirty side out of people you're

3048.66 --> 3054.0
interacting with

3050.88 --> 3057.0
and that's like unfair in a way

3054.0 --> 3057.839
it's like you slap them into becoming

3057.0 --> 3061.44
ugly

3057.839 --> 3064.44
when they did not really deserve it

3061.44 --> 3066.54
now if you do it slowly then it's

3064.44 --> 3067.859
logical then they do deserve it then

3066.54 --> 3071.7799999999997
they deserve it because they keep

3067.859 --> 3071.7799999999997
holding on getting all these signs

3073.2 --> 3076.7999999999997
right

3074.94 --> 3078.599
but when Nathan

3076.8 --> 3082.7400000000002
doesn't do that

3078.599 --> 3085.1400000000003
then it's just very vicious

3082.74 --> 3087.7799999999997
and like excessive

3085.14 --> 3089.64
you have to build up to it like unless

3087.78 --> 3091.92
you already had a history of

3089.64 --> 3093.66
communication that is on record with a

3091.92 --> 3095.94
person because then you have that direct

3093.66 --> 3097.92
history to reflect on yeah then you can

3095.94 --> 3100.68
get vicious quicker but especially if

3097.92 --> 3103.92
it's a new person or a person bringing

3100.68 --> 3106.9199999999996
on a new case to them you got to give

3103.92 --> 3109.7400000000002
them some space man because people they

3106.92 --> 3111.3
are trying to figure out in their mind

3109.74 --> 3114.18
right

3111.3 --> 3115.8590000000004
they need the room to be able to figure

3114.18 --> 3117.66
it out in their mind you need to be able

3115.859 --> 3120.96
to let them speak

3117.66 --> 3123.24
because sometimes they just need to be

3120.96 --> 3124.68
able to say it publicly among other

3123.24 --> 3128.22
people

3124.68 --> 3131.22
to even come to the realization that it

3128.22 --> 3133.859
doesn't actually work yeah because you

3131.22 --> 3137.16
can be told it doesn't work but

3133.859 --> 3140.52
sometimes you need to lay it down to

3137.16 --> 3142.3799999999997
suddenly let them and they see it and

3140.52 --> 3145.2
then they come to the conclusion it

3142.38 --> 3147.9
doesn't work yeah

3145.2 --> 3150.4399999999996
sometimes you gotta let the process

3147.9 --> 3150.44
happen

3155.099 --> 3157.76
what

3158.76 --> 3164.0400000000004
what's going on here

3161.46 --> 3166.8
right so there is some criticism

3164.04 --> 3170.48
from me towards Nathan too although I do

3166.8 --> 3170.48
think he's gotten better and he's

3170.579 --> 3175.7400000000002
just yeah it's gotten better

3174.3 --> 3178.5
but still

3175.74 --> 3182.839
there's still some

3178.5 --> 3182.839
some edges that could use polishing

3183.059 --> 3188.8190000000004
in different ways because Nathan doesn't

3186.54 --> 3191.64
like to Paula [ __ ] like that

3188.819 --> 3193.5
he likes to sharpen the blade he doesn't

3191.64 --> 3198.02
like the polishing he likes to sharpen

3193.5 --> 3198.02
but he needs to do some polishing too

3199.079 --> 3204.54
anyway in my opinion

3201.42 --> 3208.319
anyway so what the [ __ ] is going on here

3204.54 --> 3210.42
in chat Jesus you guys been talking

3208.319 --> 3212.9
which Equity panel gets under my skin

3210.42 --> 3212.9
the most

3214.14 --> 3216.92
no

3217.2 --> 3223.0989999999997
there's no particular fed panel member

3220.02 --> 3223.099
that gets under my skin

3224.22 --> 3231.2999999999997
I mean some mood wise

3228.18 --> 3233.22
uh 10th man can get under my skin and

3231.3 --> 3236.28
kneel

3233.22 --> 3238.0789999999997
but that's then it goes away again for a

3236.28 --> 3241.02
very long time in it they're excellent

3238.079 --> 3244.079
they're great to deal with like I love

3241.02 --> 3245.94
them just as much as the rest it's just

3244.079 --> 3247.1400000000003
that sometimes they get in a way and

3245.94 --> 3249.3
then

3247.14 --> 3252.0
it's like they're paranoid about me or

3249.3 --> 3254.46
something that is pissing me off

3252.0 --> 3256.74
but it does seem like they're actually

3254.46 --> 3260.3
realizing that for what it is and

3256.74 --> 3260.2999999999997
they're working on it and it's less

3260.4 --> 3264.3
they're not as

3262.38 --> 3265.8
they're not holding on to it as much

3264.3 --> 3268.3390000000004
they're not so grudgy about it and

3265.8 --> 3268.3390000000004
that's great

3268.619 --> 3274.26
right but when there is a an annoying

3272.099 --> 3277.02
thing like what I described

3274.26 --> 3279.3590000000004
by what happened yesterday

3277.02 --> 3281.7
it's never an individual it's always

3279.359 --> 3284.0989999999997
like it's the [ __ ] group Spirit

3281.7 --> 3286.98
itself you can't even address an

3284.099 --> 3290.1600000000003
individual it's like they become this

3286.98 --> 3292.5
Collective mesh it's like they certainly

3290.16 --> 3294.2999999999997
become one

3292.5 --> 3296.819
and then they all

3294.3 --> 3298.44
function like a group towards me and

3296.819 --> 3300.7799999999997
then they're like obstructing me like

3298.44 --> 3303.119
it's really weird it's like they all

3300.78 --> 3304.98
suddenly subconsciously became anti-flat

3303.119 --> 3309.6600000000003
earthers or something without realizing

3304.98 --> 3311.819
it against my specific plight

3309.66 --> 3315.359
and they start to behave collectively

3311.819 --> 3317.4
instead of as individuals

3315.359 --> 3318.96
this happening that's happened yesterday

3317.4 --> 3321.96
it's like

3318.96 --> 3324.66
and it is usually a particular chemistry

3321.96 --> 3326.2200000000003
in which chocolate saying is is a

3324.66 --> 3327.18
component every time for some weird

3326.22 --> 3328.5589999999997
reason

3327.18 --> 3332.839
and

3328.559 --> 3336.2400000000002
uh and a meekin also

3332.839 --> 3337.98
and yeah refracted curvature so they

3336.24 --> 3340.5589999999997
that happened yesterday they are

3337.98 --> 3342.78
typically around when that sort of weird

3340.559 --> 3344.8190000000004
thing happens they just it's like they

3342.78 --> 3347.42
transform into Voltron or something

3344.819 --> 3347.42
really

3349.319 --> 3353.64
it's always unexpected when that happens

3351.359 --> 3355.92
it's like they suddenly unite against me

3353.64 --> 3358.0789999999997
and it pisses me off and then I get

3355.92 --> 3360.3
angry but they get more defense and they

3358.079 --> 3363.3
start to transform it's like oh we have

3360.3 --> 3365.04
to transform into Devastator

3363.3 --> 3367.7400000000002
to stop him

3365.04 --> 3369.7799999999997
because arwen's going berserk it's like

3367.74 --> 3372.54
no I'm not I'm just pissed off because

3369.78 --> 3374.76
you just won't let me freaking finish a

3372.54 --> 3377.04
sentence for a minute straight

3374.76 --> 3381.98
like you can't do it you just can't let

3377.04 --> 3381.98
me do it and just I can't handle that

3382.98 --> 3389.339
yeah but can't handle a thing it's not

3387.0 --> 3392.579
being able

3389.339 --> 3395.099
to finish my sentence when I'm trying to

3392.579 --> 3398.7000000000003
explain something that is

3395.099 --> 3402.559
complex and requires Stillness it

3398.7 --> 3402.5589999999997
requires Stillness to see it

3403.14 --> 3408.7799999999997
and by rhombusing you are basically

3405.42 --> 3410.52
saying we don't care we don't care we

3408.78 --> 3412.1400000000003
don't want to hear

3410.52 --> 3414.96
but you're not saying that you're not

3412.14 --> 3418.7999999999997
admitting that that is the case so it's

3414.96 --> 3420.66
a pure subconscious obstruction process

3418.8 --> 3422.4
while the Consciousness is like doesn't

3420.66 --> 3426.1189999999997
realize it's even happened that's what's

3422.4 --> 3428.339
happening with them when that happens

3426.119 --> 3431.2200000000003
it is like a rhombus effect but it's all

3428.339 --> 3432.599
subconscious they don't really know that

3431.22 --> 3435.54
that's what happening because otherwise

3432.599 --> 3437.819
they just say no Arwin we don't want to

3435.54 --> 3440.4
have this conversation or something

3437.819 --> 3443.4
right that would be a conscious

3440.4 --> 3443.4
reuniting

3443.64 --> 3448.0789999999997
with that effect and basically admitting

3446.64 --> 3450.18
like we don't want to have this

3448.079 --> 3451.98
conversation and then I'd be like oh

3450.18 --> 3454.5
okay

3451.98 --> 3456.359
but no it is not admitting it so I feel

3454.5 --> 3460.26
forced to keep continue trying to

3456.359 --> 3464.04
explain it while they obstruct me

3460.26 --> 3466.44
without admitting it

3464.04 --> 3468.24
and this is a very weird process it

3466.44 --> 3469.859
makes me feel like they're just acting

3468.24 --> 3473.4599999999996
collectively

3469.859 --> 3475.98
because they all then start arguing with

3473.46 --> 3478.76
it like against me together

3475.98 --> 3478.76
like that

3479.7 --> 3484.5589999999997
and you should do more guests on my okay

3482.819 --> 3488.48
you want to be a guest blue pill

3484.559 --> 3488.48
Evolution you want to get on

3500.22 --> 3503.839
and she could see you

3506.88 --> 3511.88
chuckled saying makes dope truth raps

3509.28 --> 3511.88
yeah he does

3512.7 --> 3517.5789999999997
and he's chuckapedia

3514.8 --> 3517.579
which is awesome

3532.619 --> 3536.88
getting camera shiny year old well if

3535.2 --> 3539.7799999999997
you're getting camera shy then why did

3536.88 --> 3539.78
you bring it up then

3551.46 --> 3556.26
hey if you know any people that like to

3553.799 --> 3558.72
get on my show just let me know

3556.26 --> 3560.5200000000004
yeah I don't get a lot of people that

3558.72 --> 3561.359
are like hey Arwin can I get on your

3560.52 --> 3564.54
show

3561.359 --> 3566.5789999999997
I don't get those I got it though I have

3564.54 --> 3569.24
in the past some of those were just like

3566.579 --> 3569.2400000000002
crazy people

3570.66 --> 3574.799
I'm not talking about uh staz Moretz he

3573.42 --> 3576.059
was actually a cool guy I haven't heard

3574.799 --> 3579.24
from him in a while

3576.059 --> 3581.8190000000004
but I don't get many people like hey

3579.24 --> 3584.7
want to do a show together

3581.819 --> 3586.319
or ever I don't know why maybe I'm too

3584.7 --> 3589.3799999999997
unhinged

3586.319 --> 3592.339
maybe I'm too scary

3589.38 --> 3592.339
I don't know

3597.0 --> 3602.099
you want to see me interact with people

3599.46 --> 3604.52
well then send people my way and you'll

3602.099 --> 3604.52
get that

3609.0 --> 3613.74
talk crap about me and make fun of me

3611.52 --> 3615.619
when I'm not around absolutely not

3613.74 --> 3618.9799999999996
no no no no no

3615.619 --> 3618.98
absolutely not

3622.5 --> 3627.059
no they're not like that at all they

3624.54 --> 3629.339
definitely are not two-faced

3627.059 --> 3631.6800000000003
like that

3629.339 --> 3633.48
I'm very certain that what I just

3631.68 --> 3635.94
described that subconscious process

3633.48 --> 3638.579
that's like subconscious social dynamics

3635.94 --> 3641.46
which is [ __ ] complicated

3638.579 --> 3643.559
okay most people don't know what's going

3641.46 --> 3647.2200000000003
on when that happens they just don't

3643.559 --> 3650.299
know I do because I'm an empath

3647.22 --> 3650.299
and a psychologist

3652.5 --> 3657.48
and have been on the other side of it

3654.96 --> 3661.7400000000002
too Ben I

3657.48 --> 3664.559
have done that in groups to other people

3661.74 --> 3666.7799999999997
I know how that works when I described

3664.559 --> 3669.78
there is based basically on my own

3666.78 --> 3669.78
experience

3675.119 --> 3678.38
oh really made a video

3680.28 --> 3685.38
you're talking like me oh okay

3683.64 --> 3689.66
so it's like your inner thoughts

3685.38 --> 3689.6600000000003
interesting I'll check it out later LSG

3694.65 --> 3700.28
[Music]

3696.2 --> 3703.7
yeah but I'm fine with that but I mean

3700.28 --> 3703.7000000000003
Bring It On

3708.359 --> 3713.64
it's like they gotta have a subject or

3710.94 --> 3716.64
they gotta have questions

3713.64 --> 3719.819
like questions that they want to ask me

3716.64 --> 3723.3799999999997
deeper and like you just gotta realize

3719.819 --> 3723.38
how I work it's like

3724.44 --> 3728.52
because you can't just expect somebody

3726.48 --> 3731.22
to come in and like oh yeah Irwin what

3728.52 --> 3734.66
do you want to talk about like

3731.22 --> 3734.66
it's not how this works

3735.66 --> 3738.66
you're gonna find something that you

3737.04 --> 3740.579
want to talk about and then I can

3738.66 --> 3744.0
supplement

3740.579 --> 3745.38
then I can add to that because there's

3744.0 --> 3748.76
like everything I could talk about

3745.38 --> 3748.76
everything it's just that

3748.85 --> 3751.969
[Music]

3754.38 --> 3760.1400000000003
like don't make me just pick

3757.93 --> 3763.64
[Music]

3760.14 --> 3763.64
it's like which

3764.16 --> 3769.0789999999997
which grain of sand in this desert are

3767.4 --> 3772.28
you going to choose and that's kind of

3769.079 --> 3772.28
what it feels like to me

3773.339 --> 3776.339
foreign

3779.7 --> 3785.5789999999997
or I'll just end up talking about

3781.74 --> 3787.319
something recent then right

3785.579 --> 3789.78
but it's much more interesting when

3787.319 --> 3791.46
somebody has like a real serious

3789.78 --> 3793.3190000000004
question or

3791.46 --> 3795.92
or

3793.319 --> 3798.72
if somebody actually had

3795.92 --> 3802.04
in-depth question or refinement

3798.72 --> 3804.66
questions concerning some of my esoteric

3802.04 --> 3807.48
mechanisms that I've talked about

3804.66 --> 3810.1189999999997
I'd love about that love to talk about

3807.48 --> 3812.94
that in in a personal talk if somebody

3810.119 --> 3814.5
actually gets that

3812.94 --> 3817.859
right

3814.5 --> 3820.22
and I'd probably test them like can you

3817.859 --> 3825.54
give me an example

3820.22 --> 3829.14
of where you see this system applying

3825.54 --> 3833.64
with you and then I will derive from

3829.14 --> 3836.04
your reflection how you're saying it how

3833.64 --> 3838.859
correct it is

3836.04 --> 3841.74
from the energy

3838.859 --> 3843.299
like how much does it apply and dude and

3841.74 --> 3845.9599999999996
that's when the real magic starts

3843.299 --> 3849.359
happening because the like the the

3845.96 --> 3852.299
condensed level of spiritual metadata

3849.359 --> 3855.25
that then starts to come out of you

3852.299 --> 3858.34
reveals like incredibly much

3855.25 --> 3858.34
[Music]

3877.88 --> 3882.6600000000003
oh interesting organic farming yeah yeah

3881.22 --> 3884.7599999999998
I'm more colored

3882.66 --> 3886.92
yeah I mean those are the types of

3884.76 --> 3890.119
things that make YouTube awesome that

3886.92 --> 3892.5
that's around like oh

3890.119 --> 3895.339
invaluable amounts

3892.5 --> 3895.339
of like

3896.04 --> 3902.52
uh what do you call that

3899.28 --> 3905.099
engineering knowledge right can you

3902.52 --> 3907.619
imagine that like Farmers tricks and all

3905.099 --> 3910.44
that that used to be like Regional

3907.619 --> 3912.54
Secrets it's like a family secret like

3910.44 --> 3913.619
you know we know how to make the soil

3912.54 --> 3916.2599999999998
like this

3913.619 --> 3919.079
so that's our secret right this Guild

3916.26 --> 3921.96
secret or Family secret now it's like

3919.079 --> 3923.2400000000002
the internet and it's like you can get

3921.96 --> 3926.64
like

3923.24 --> 3930.24
unbelievably precious level knowledge

3926.64 --> 3933.1189999999997
like in overabundance

3930.24 --> 3935.4599999999996
like that kind of knowledge that's on

3933.119 --> 3938.76
the internet like by a basic click like

3935.46 --> 3941.94
it wants to be found by you yeah if you

3938.76 --> 3944.5200000000004
tell that to like a farmer 500 years ago

3941.94 --> 3945.839
they'd think you're [ __ ] insane

3944.52 --> 3947.64
it's like

3945.839 --> 3950.119
who the hell would just give that

3947.64 --> 3950.1189999999997
knowledge

3950.52 --> 3957.119
like want you to have that's crazy

3954.42 --> 3960.42
but I'll take it because it's like yeah

3957.119 --> 3962.339
man that's so valuable it's like that's

3960.42 --> 3964.619
information gold

3962.339 --> 3966.7799999999997
and it's just spouting out like a

3964.619 --> 3968.76
fountain everywhere and people

3966.78 --> 3970.88
most of them didn't even really look at

3968.76 --> 3970.88
it

3972.18 --> 3977.64
but what a precious resource

3975.18 --> 3979.98
I mean

3977.64 --> 3982.44
I almost say like

3979.98 --> 3985.02
find a couple of like really good

3982.44 --> 3987.359
technical channels about that like how

3985.02 --> 3990.619
to grow soil

3987.359 --> 3996.319
and like how to combine plants right

3990.619 --> 3996.319
specialist videos and like download it

3997.38 --> 4003.799
put it on a disk and potentially even

4000.5 --> 4006.619
like have it transcribed and printed out

4003.799 --> 4008.2
or so make it into a book because what

4006.619 --> 4010.4
if the internet just

4008.2 --> 4013.0389999999998
it's all [ __ ]

4010.4 --> 4015.26
yeah I mean it can happen I mean it's

4013.039 --> 4017.599
not likely to happen because when that's

4015.26 --> 4019.94
[ __ ] everything is [ __ ] and they the

4017.599 --> 4022.3590000000004
ones that would do it lose control so

4019.94 --> 4024.92
it's not likely to just happen like that

4022.359 --> 4027.319
more likely to incremental like

4024.92 --> 4028.88
degradation of the quality like removal

4027.319 --> 4032.119
of good [ __ ]

4028.88 --> 4034.579
right so like fish the good [ __ ] out and

4032.119 --> 4037.7000000000003
make sure it is immortalized that it

4034.579 --> 4040.2200000000003
can't be deleted by having it on a disk

4037.7 --> 4041.0589999999997
and potentially having it on paper and

4040.22 --> 4044.5989999999997
then

4041.059 --> 4046.4
this valuable knowledge like it might

4044.599 --> 4049.6600000000003
not just come back

4046.4 --> 4049.6600000000003
after a certain point

4051.26 --> 4055.5200000000004
and that's it kind of makes me feel

4053.42 --> 4058.7000000000003
stupid too because I'm like wow this is

4055.52 --> 4061.819
so incredibly useful but like I'm not in

4058.7 --> 4064.7
a position to actually use that

4061.819 --> 4066.74
when I'm trying to absorb the memory of

4064.7 --> 4069.14
like these tricks so that it at least

4066.74 --> 4072.74
know knowing which direction I should

4069.14 --> 4074.96
look for improvement if I ever get to

4072.74 --> 4076.9399999999996
that position of doing that

4074.96 --> 4080.359
right

4076.94 --> 4082.4
the pre-storage the information

4080.359 --> 4084.64
but it would be great if there was just

4082.4 --> 4084.64
like

4084.94 --> 4090.5
indestructible

4087.099 --> 4092.42
databases of that sort of thing and it

4090.5 --> 4095.319
wasn't all just left to Big tech

4092.42 --> 4099.759
companies to manage all that like

4095.319 --> 4099.759
unbelievably precious data

4104.97 --> 4108.06
[Music]

4108.14 --> 4113.42
Catch 22 normies make it bad yeah but

4111.08 --> 4118.04
that's all told it look

4113.42 --> 4121.819
yeah you get the the crazy people NPC

4118.04 --> 4124.46
Trends acting [ __ ] on camera

4121.819 --> 4127.9400000000005
for super chats yeah

4124.46 --> 4130.219
that exists too but I mean

4127.94 --> 4132.5
does it really matter

4130.219 --> 4135.279
it's a stupid Trend it makes everybody

4132.5 --> 4139.4
look [ __ ]

4135.279 --> 4141.1990000000005
but does it actually do anything

4139.4 --> 4143.599999999999
no it's just gonna be forgotten as

4141.199 --> 4145.639999999999
another stupid trend

4143.6 --> 4147.56
there will always be really [ __ ]

4145.64 --> 4150.4400000000005
stupid Trends because there are people

4147.56 --> 4152.779
that are like I don't want to be smart I

4150.44 --> 4155.0599999999995
don't want all this responsibility and

4152.779 --> 4158.4800000000005
all this information I need to learn and

4155.06 --> 4160.759
understand and get wisdom yeah I want to

4158.48 --> 4163.9
do [ __ ] [ __ ] stuff I wanted to

4160.759 --> 4163.9
see like a girl go

4164.08 --> 4170.299
and then like yeah yeah just throw my

4167.239 --> 4172.639999999999
money at it yeah yeah I'm badass yeah

4170.299 --> 4175.16
yeah there will be people that are like

4172.64 --> 4179.719
[ __ ] it all I want to be [ __ ] I want

4175.16 --> 4182.42
to do something [ __ ] and so yeah you

4179.719 --> 4185.06
could highlight that and put it on the

4182.42 --> 4188.359
billboard everywhere look at how

4185.06 --> 4190.46
[ __ ] people are this is really

4188.359 --> 4193.400000000001
popular these people are making

4190.46 --> 4196.64
thousands of dollars by acting really

4193.4 --> 4199.099999999999
[ __ ] humanity is really [ __ ]

4196.64 --> 4203.4800000000005
yeah you could do that all day long

4199.1 --> 4207.38
or you could like just let it just yeah

4203.48 --> 4209.718999999999
just who cares just yeah people get

4207.38 --> 4212.84
returned I mean some people

4209.719 --> 4216.02
really like to drink until they pass out

4212.84 --> 4218.06
yeah that's pretty [ __ ] [ __ ] too

4216.02 --> 4220.1
does that mean you have to have on a

4218.06 --> 4223.219
billboard look at all these people

4220.1 --> 4225.4400000000005
drinking themselves [ __ ] oh everyone

4223.219 --> 4228.26
is [ __ ] look at all these drunk

4225.44 --> 4231.98
people it's a significant percentage of

4228.26 --> 4236.360000000001
the population it's like

4231.98 --> 4240.139999999999
or you could just like just not do that

4236.36 --> 4243.92
and maybe try to dig for the more

4240.14 --> 4243.92
fascinating productive

4244.1 --> 4248.780000000001
information

4246.679 --> 4250.58
right that's not always put on the

4248.78 --> 4253.759999999999
billboard

4250.58 --> 4256.159
because it is there there is thousands

4253.76 --> 4259.719
of people that are doing incredibly

4256.159 --> 4261.799999999999
productive constructive informative work

4259.719 --> 4264.62
out there

4261.8 --> 4266.659000000001
thousands thousands of people Millions

4264.62 --> 4268.76
potentially it's just that

4266.659 --> 4270.879999999999
I'm probably not gonna bump into all of

4268.76 --> 4270.88
those

4271.1 --> 4275.06
because a lot of them are of course also

4273.26 --> 4277.1
other languages

4275.06 --> 4280.04
and

4277.1 --> 4283.52
just another style like they wouldn't be

4280.04 --> 4284.84
compatible in Social format and like it

4283.52 --> 4286.820000000001
wouldn't be

4284.84 --> 4289.52
good at communicating with one like

4286.82 --> 4292.46
there's different ways of just composing

4289.52 --> 4295.52
yourself and all that so

4292.46 --> 4297.679
but just for one person alone there's

4295.52 --> 4300.56
like a thousand other people that have

4297.679 --> 4302.84
like Precious information available

4300.56 --> 4305.4800000000005
continually

4302.84 --> 4308.360000000001
just focus on those don't focus on the

4305.48 --> 4313.82
stupid retards that love to throw money

4308.36 --> 4315.5
at completely abysmal entertainment

4313.82 --> 4317.84
you know

4315.5 --> 4320.96
it's part of the process if you always

4317.84 --> 4324.32
like oh it's complaining about oh stupid

4320.96 --> 4326.6
ugly people oh look at that uh why do

4324.32 --> 4329.239
they do that oh we gotta stop it or

4326.6 --> 4331.84
something like dude you are now giving

4329.239 --> 4335.0199999999995
it all that attention and thereby

4331.84 --> 4335.02
reinforcing it

4335.3 --> 4340.1
yeah when the stupid sjw [ __ ] started to

4338.9 --> 4342.799999999999
come out

4340.1 --> 4344.659000000001
during the Obama era and like videos of

4342.8 --> 4348.04
them like being completely retired like

4344.659 --> 4352.82
even did the jiggly piggy people

4348.04 --> 4355.699
you know that [ __ ] I was like dude don't

4352.82 --> 4358.099999999999
please just

4355.699 --> 4361.4
put it in a box

4358.1 --> 4363.38
just forget about it don't don't give

4361.4 --> 4365.839999999999
them attention this is

4363.38 --> 4368.659000000001
not good you should not give that

4365.84 --> 4371.7390000000005
attention at all don't let it on and

4368.659 --> 4374.78
then oh my God like the entire

4371.739 --> 4376.639999999999
conspiracy sector everybody started to

4374.78 --> 4379.46
get obsessed over them and Alex Jones

4376.64 --> 4381.64
everyday videos about that and then it's

4379.46 --> 4381.64
like

4384.739 --> 4390.0199999999995
because now everybody [ __ ] thinks

4387.98 --> 4392.959999999999
that like half the people in the world

4390.02 --> 4394.820000000001
are these retards

4392.96 --> 4398.02
because that's what we've put on the

4394.82 --> 4398.0199999999995
Billboards everywhere

4398.54 --> 4405.08
so you actually gave them

4401.98 --> 4407.239
enormous amounts of power you gave these

4405.08 --> 4412.659
crazy people enormous amounts of Power

4407.239 --> 4412.659
by making everybody familiar with them

4414.5 --> 4422.06
and as a result it's palpable they got

4418.34 --> 4426.26
even more crazy it was like teaching

4422.06 --> 4427.580000000001
success it worked we we got completely

4426.26 --> 4430.1
ape [ __ ]

4427.58 --> 4431.54
and it spread around everybody like was

4430.1 --> 4434.3
like look at this look at this they're

4431.54 --> 4435.98
crazy spread around and we were able to

4434.3 --> 4440.3
communicate our mind control messages

4435.98 --> 4444.86
and so now we gotta get even crazier so

4440.3 --> 4447.02
get out the the lipstick wearing bald

4444.86 --> 4449.78
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4447.02 --> 4452.3
that guy remember and like

4449.78 --> 4454.28
and all those like make it even worse

4452.3 --> 4456.08
now yeah it worked the first time so

4454.28 --> 4459.139999999999
we're gonna do it worse now let's see

4456.08 --> 4461.179
how much attention we get this side and

4459.14 --> 4465.9400000000005
it's like people keep

4461.179 --> 4465.9400000000005
taking this making the same mistake

4466.58 --> 4472.159
it's just

4468.92 --> 4473.96
just put them in a corner in a box and

4472.159 --> 4475.699
it's like yeah

4473.96 --> 4478.76
and when you do that right when you say

4475.699 --> 4481.159
like ah no just you just go over there I

4478.76 --> 4483.9800000000005
don't want to know then they're like oh

4481.159 --> 4486.0199999999995
we don't want that but we want to get in

4483.98 --> 4487.759999999999
your face we don't want to be in this

4486.02 --> 4489.080000000001
box we want to be in the place where

4487.76 --> 4490.9400000000005
you're at

4489.08 --> 4493.76
because we want to be in your face yeah

4490.94 --> 4495.98
yeah that's exactly the [ __ ] point

4493.76 --> 4499.58
that's the point that's why they do it

4495.98 --> 4503.48
and that's why giving them attention the

4499.58 --> 4505.46
way alternative media right wing or

4503.48 --> 4508.218999999999
whatever has done

4505.46 --> 4510.26
it literally gave them more power than

4508.219 --> 4513.08
ever before

4510.26 --> 4515.659000000001
you put them on a pedestal

4513.08 --> 4518.48
you thought you put them in a pit but

4515.659 --> 4521.179
you put them on a pedestal

4518.48 --> 4523.218999999999
you complain about it

4521.179 --> 4525.1990000000005
but you're not actually stopping them

4523.219 --> 4526.88
and so you think you're putting them in

4525.199 --> 4528.919999999999
a pit but you're actually putting them

4526.88 --> 4530.78
on a pedestal and you don't even realize

4528.92 --> 4534.32
it

4530.78 --> 4535.88
which makes you the fool

4534.32 --> 4537.32
because you think you're winning but

4535.88 --> 4541.2390000000005
you're doing the op you're actually

4537.32 --> 4541.239
giving them a win by doing that

4543.679 --> 4548.679
it's Unstoppable you can't stop these

4545.9 --> 4552.62
people you can't stop these

4548.679 --> 4555.6990000000005
counter people that bite on down on it

4552.62 --> 4555.699
they just keep doing it

4556.82 --> 4561.5
it's like they get cheap attention by

4559.159 --> 4563.78
bringing forth the people pushing the

4561.5 --> 4566.3
people in your face that are literally

4563.78 --> 4567.679
being as insane as they are to get your

4566.3 --> 4570.56
attention

4567.679 --> 4574.1
so they're like using the crazy people

4570.56 --> 4575.96
that seek attention to get attention

4574.1 --> 4577.400000000001
and then they think that they are

4575.96 --> 4581.12
successful

4577.4 --> 4582.799999999999
when they literally gave the people that

4581.12 --> 4585.32
are there using and just supposedly

4582.8 --> 4587.719
putting them in a pit exactly what they

4585.32 --> 4590.42
needed which is that everybody gets to

4587.719 --> 4593.179
see them and they get a chance to Echo

4590.42 --> 4595.4
their crazy mind control messages

4593.179 --> 4598.219
you're doing that

4595.4 --> 4600.739
like oh look at this crazy thing that he

4598.219 --> 4601.58
said oh so mind control oh listen to

4600.739 --> 4606.099999999999
this

4601.58 --> 4606.1
playing the video spreading the message

4606.72 --> 4615.9400000000005
[Music]

4613.159 --> 4615.94
it's

4617.3 --> 4620.7390000000005
kind of demoralizing

4621.08 --> 4626.36
because it it truly is like people's

4624.08 --> 4628.5
idiocy

4626.36 --> 4629.78
that's keeping this

4628.5 --> 4633.38
[Music]

4629.78 --> 4636.199
this crazy LGBT

4633.38 --> 4639.92
Marxist

4636.199 --> 4639.919999999999
thing blooming

4642.38 --> 4646.0
it's keeping it blooming

4664.34 --> 4669.219
right the real solution is is basically

4669.26 --> 4674.42
ah the islamists are doing it

4672.14 --> 4677.659000000001
I mean they're not like talking about

4674.42 --> 4681.7390000000005
LGBT [ __ ] all day long on their media

4677.659 --> 4684.379999999999
yeah they just know like it's a No-No

4681.739 --> 4687.08
not in our place we don't abide by that

4684.38 --> 4689.4800000000005
we don't let you in

4687.08 --> 4693.679
places that we have control of

4689.48 --> 4696.739
and we ignore you we don't let our

4693.679 --> 4699.8
common experience our Collective group

4696.739 --> 4702.08
experience get polluted

4699.8 --> 4704.900000000001
my consciousness of you because you are

4702.08 --> 4708.94
the devil and they get that

4704.9 --> 4713.259999999999
and we should be doing that too

4708.94 --> 4713.259999999999
Christians should be doing that too

4715.1 --> 4720.5
and yeah

4718.159 --> 4722.12
you know what I mean

4720.5 --> 4724.159
instead they're giving it all the

4722.12 --> 4726.199
attention they want or they're even

4724.159 --> 4728.839999999999
allowing them in their freaking Church

4726.199 --> 4731.719
like oh we gotta replace the flag we're

4728.84 --> 4735.76
gonna do it oh you're not

4731.719 --> 4735.76
you're not liberal enough you need a

4736.64 --> 4743.2390000000005
a lesbian pastor

4739.76 --> 4747.64
yes that's what you need

4743.239 --> 4747.639999999999
like that's crazy people

4752.12 --> 4756.679
the craziest thing about is that

4754.46 --> 4759.38
everybody in such church is accepted

4756.679 --> 4762.52
it's a culture it's a mockery of

4759.38 --> 4762.52
Christianity it's like

4763.1 --> 4769.400000000001
it's worth worse

4766.76 --> 4771.02
than the Catholic church when they do

4769.4 --> 4773.96
that

4771.02 --> 4776.6
like LGBT supposed Christian they are

4773.96 --> 4779.96
basically just one step away of just

4776.6 --> 4782.360000000001
replacing the cross

4779.96 --> 4786.14
with a Baphomet statue I mean it's just

4782.36 --> 4788.48
one little step away it's just like

4786.14 --> 4791.08
and there you go it's like it was always

4788.48 --> 4791.08
meant to be

4812.719 --> 4818.179
if you don't see what they're selling

4815.96 --> 4820.76
to talk about what

4818.179 --> 4822.92
right yeah

4820.76 --> 4825.26
don't buy yeah but it's not even about

4822.92 --> 4827.3
buying it or accepting another it's

4825.26 --> 4830.2390000000005
about

4827.3 --> 4834.56
being exposed to that stuff pollute you

4830.239 --> 4838.759999999999
it's like comparable to hearing about

4834.56 --> 4841.1
sex or porn acts all the time right it's

4838.76 --> 4843.1990000000005
like yeah you know what it is but if you

4841.1 --> 4844.88
just keep hearing that [ __ ] around if

4843.199 --> 4846.98
like you have a roommate that's like sex

4844.88 --> 4850.400000000001
obsessed PornHub says always talking

4846.98 --> 4852.32
about you're eventually gonna like have

4850.4 --> 4854.659
your attention drawn to that and you'll

4852.32 --> 4856.34
start to see you're suddenly like

4854.659 --> 4858.379999999999
walking the supermarket and without

4856.34 --> 4861.38
realizing you're like looking at women's

4858.38 --> 4863.900000000001
butts like comparing it

4861.38 --> 4865.54
because that starts happening because of

4863.9 --> 4869.0599999999995
the exposure

4865.54 --> 4871.64
to that thinking that Focus all the time

4869.06 --> 4875.179
even if you're not the one doing it you

4871.64 --> 4878.12
see exposure it rubs off on you this is

4875.179 --> 4881.0
what happens and it also happens with

4878.12 --> 4882.739
crazy LGBT

4881.0 --> 4885.56
[ __ ]

4882.739 --> 4889.28
that also rubs off on you you start to

4885.56 --> 4892.9400000000005
think of you start to look at kids and

4889.28 --> 4894.62
in your mind analyze if they are

4892.94 --> 4897.0199999999995
potentially

4894.62 --> 4899.96
queer or something and how you would

4897.02 --> 4902.5
recognize it when if you weren't exposed

4899.96 --> 4905.96
to that guess what you look at the kid

4902.5 --> 4909.08
it's just a kid

4905.96 --> 4911.719
but because you're LGBT oh well that you

4909.08 --> 4915.44
do they're attacking us you will find

4911.719 --> 4919.699
yourself to be in that mind position of

4915.44 --> 4922.58
the lgbtq thinking about people how they

4919.699 --> 4925.58
are that thing like how they're queer or

4922.58 --> 4928.4
whatever what their pronouns are

4925.58 --> 4930.199
even though that's your enemy you might

4928.4 --> 4932.599999999999
want to learn it because you want to be

4930.199 --> 4935.178999999999
able to defend against when they bring

4932.6 --> 4937.820000000001
that forth right when that might not

4935.179 --> 4940.6990000000005
even happen so you've become the enemy

4937.82 --> 4942.98
thinking you're fighting the enemy

4940.699 --> 4945.5599999999995
by letting it rub off on you too much

4942.98 --> 4947.299999999999
obsessing over it to overcome it you've

4945.56 --> 4950.14
become it

4947.3 --> 4950.14
was that

4950.96 --> 4954.7390000000005
no

4952.34 --> 4956.900000000001
yeah well done

4954.739 --> 4959.36
thank you for that refugee

4956.9 --> 4961.4
but uh

4959.36 --> 4965.0199999999995
yeah

4961.4 --> 4965.0199999999995
it's pretty serious out there

4965.54 --> 4968.72
[Music]

4969.26 --> 4971.860000000001
foreign

4974.179 --> 4979.06
you don't overcome something by

4976.159 --> 4979.0599999999995
obsessing over it

4979.28 --> 4982.84
you overcome something by

4983.84 --> 4991.34
growing something new Grassroots

4987.32 --> 4992.679
that makes the thing that was perceived

4991.34 --> 4996.400000000001
as the problem

4992.679 --> 4996.4
Superfluous and outdated

4996.739 --> 5001.86
that's the real way through you see

5002.26 --> 5005.26
outgrowing

5007.179 --> 5012.52
you don't mirror it don't mimic it to

5010.54 --> 5015.159
try to neutralize it

5012.52 --> 5017.860000000001
you become something else that simply

5015.159 --> 5020.5
makes that thing completely Superfluous

5017.86 --> 5024.099999999999
and forgotten

5020.5 --> 5027.04
that's how you overcome it

5024.1 --> 5029.38
and Muslims get this

5027.04 --> 5031.78
they have very

5029.38 --> 5033.9400000000005
close to Heart teachings through Islam

5031.78 --> 5035.5599999999995
and through their Community culture that

5033.94 --> 5037.9
where they discuss these kind of

5035.56 --> 5040.719
esoteric things

5037.9 --> 5042.699
like they know that they know that

5040.719 --> 5044.86
things rub off on you

5042.699 --> 5047.32
and that how important it is to be

5044.86 --> 5048.759999999999
conscious of that

5047.32 --> 5051.099999999999
for God

5048.76 --> 5053.1990000000005
how important that is to them

5051.1 --> 5056.08
but in the west people have kind of like

5053.199 --> 5058.96
they've let atheism and nonsense and

5056.08 --> 5060.219
freedom

5058.96 --> 5062.02
just

5060.219 --> 5063.94
they don't take it as Seer they don't

5062.02 --> 5067.120000000001
see it they don't see how important that

5063.94 --> 5069.159
is as much I mean people now are

5067.12 --> 5071.739
starting to catch on slowly just because

5069.159 --> 5073.599999999999
of the burn

5071.739 --> 5076.98
of the Western World getting cracked

5073.6 --> 5076.9800000000005
down on with Neo feudalism

5077.08 --> 5082.9
but for a century or so we've been

5080.8 --> 5087.0
letting our guard down

5082.9 --> 5087.0
and Muslims have not

5104.08 --> 5107.159
hello getting wisdom

5111.52 --> 5115.659000000001
pregnancy

5112.659 --> 5118.54
yes fluffy snow

5115.659 --> 5121.32
I did not put a stop to that that's

5118.54 --> 5121.32
absurd

5126.04 --> 5132.0
like why the how the [ __ ] am I putting a

5129.28 --> 5132.0
stop to that

5145.36 --> 5150.839999999999
what you expect me to terrorize them or

5148.659 --> 5150.839999999999
something

5150.88 --> 5156.639
or start conniving spreading false

5153.76 --> 5159.1
rumors like a gay to get them apart no

5156.639 --> 5161.26
no how about

5159.1 --> 5163.120000000001
just close the freaking door when you're

5161.26 --> 5165.46
making out

5163.12 --> 5169.179
and the rest is just I don't want to

5165.46 --> 5171.54
know about it yeah that's my that's what

5169.179 --> 5171.54
I do

5182.56 --> 5185.9800000000005
I've seen before I'd never been a lot of

5184.179 --> 5188.4
extreme preachers talk about most yeah

5185.98 --> 5188.4
good

5195.94 --> 5199.919999999999
yeah the far right is right

5206.199 --> 5213.82
a bit disturbing well

5210.52 --> 5216.6990000000005
they're just more real

5213.82 --> 5218.08
yeah what I find disturbing is how the

5216.699 --> 5221.5
Western world

5218.08 --> 5224.139
has deluded itself

5221.5 --> 5227.32
that's what I find disturbing

5224.139 --> 5229.54
yeah and the fruits are provably there

5227.32 --> 5232.5
look at how deranged some of these

5229.54 --> 5232.5
people in the west are

5235.78 --> 5242.94
and how lying

5239.02 --> 5246.159000000001
and conniving they have become

5242.94 --> 5248.4
shamelessly lying to the camera all the

5246.159 --> 5248.4
time

5248.98 --> 5256.419999999999
like that's a western thing that's that

5252.28 --> 5259.3
doesn't happen in the Middle East yeah

5256.42 --> 5261.28
I mean yeah they might trick people they

5259.3 --> 5264.639
might lie slightly but they're very

5261.28 --> 5269.0199999999995
careful about because lying there

5264.639 --> 5271.96
actually has consequences you see

5269.02 --> 5273.219
it's not [ __ ] it you can do whatever you

5271.96 --> 5275.7390000000005
want

5273.219 --> 5278.58
and get away with it

5275.739 --> 5278.58
like in the West

5285.58 --> 5288.82
you would move out yeah that's cool for

5287.62 --> 5290.05
you

5288.82 --> 5292.48
but uh

5290.05 --> 5295.12
[Music]

5292.48 --> 5297.339999999999
yeah I'm not gonna be uh

5295.12 --> 5301.08
scared out by a gay

5297.34 --> 5301.08
because I'm not a wussy

5302.44 --> 5307.178999999999
yeah and if they get [ __ ] gross on me

5304.9 --> 5309.58
and they like doing it on purpose like

5307.179 --> 5312.12
disrespecting me then I will get [ __ ]

5309.58 --> 5312.12
pissed off

5314.26 --> 5320.76
and if they go really too far I might

5317.139 --> 5320.76
contact a couple of Muslims

5321.04 --> 5325.6
and ask them some advice on what I could

5323.26 --> 5327.52
do about that [ __ ] if I literally have

5325.6 --> 5330.6990000000005
people that are being like on purpose

5327.52 --> 5332.860000000001
offensively gay to me just to bully me

5330.699 --> 5335.62
well

5332.86 --> 5338.259999999999
you want any serious long-term Solutions

5335.62 --> 5340.599999999999
you better consult a serious Muslim

5338.26 --> 5342.46
because they know how to deal with that

5340.6 --> 5344.56
and I'm not just talking throwing them

5342.46 --> 5346.139
off a building I'm talking like they

5344.56 --> 5348.9400000000005
have

5346.139 --> 5352.2390000000005
developed strategies

5348.94 --> 5354.78

freaks

5354.94 --> 5361.08
in other countries where it's not Sharia

5357.46 --> 5361.08
they know how to deal with it

5361.9 --> 5366.04
what do they do they're not doing

5363.46 --> 5367.96
anything it was just a suggestion from

5366.04 --> 5370.32
this guy in chat that they're doing all

5367.96 --> 5370.32
these things

5380.32 --> 5384.58
seeing way more women yes but that's

5383.08 --> 5388.5599999999995
just as gay

this is really annoying me

5422.58 --> 5430.96
all right no I'm not I was hypothetical

5426.12 --> 5433.0599999999995
it said if if some gay guys start doing

5430.96 --> 5435.699
that

5433.06 --> 5439.620000000001
start like bullying me

5435.699 --> 5439.62
because of my homophobia

5439.78 --> 5445.42
right then

5442.84 --> 5447.52
it's an if like that's not happening

5445.42 --> 5450.9400000000005

5447.52 --> 5453.6990000000005

haven't like gotten angry

5453.699 --> 5460.239
to the face of the guy one time because

5456.76 --> 5463.96
he is really trying to do his best

5460.239 --> 5466.54
to be civil and orderly

5463.96 --> 5468.78
but he's also just [ __ ] gay and he's

5466.54 --> 5468.78
like

5469.0 --> 5475.06
sometimes and that the only issue was

5472.179 --> 5478.4800000000005
like just close the freaking door just

5475.06 --> 5481.5
don't make me see it and then

5478.48 --> 5481.5
I can live with it

5484.12 --> 5486.54
right

5504.219 --> 5509.5
right but yeah overly sexualized women

5507.1 --> 5512.9800000000005
in public yeah

5509.5 --> 5516.06
that's like a trend too and it is coming

5512.98 --> 5516.0599999999995
from the same thing

5516.4 --> 5520.44
it's it's like porn culture

and I do not find it very

5523.659 --> 5526.739

5650.98 --> 5655.32
I don't know rape is gay

5663.52 --> 5670.9800000000005
it's all about the aberration about

5717.699 --> 5721.138999999999
obsessed with women

5725.62 --> 5730.42

5728.02 --> 5732.580000000001
to do anything with like sexuality

5730.42 --> 5737.82
anymore it's not

5732.58 --> 5737.82
I mean those men don't like women

5738.28 --> 5742.0199999999995
or they don't like anybody

5744.04 --> 5750.5199999999995

they might not even know they might not

well you're only better than those other

creatures if you choose better than

5853.719 --> 5858.219
those other creatures

5856.12 --> 5861.219
because it is about the choice it's the

5858.219 --> 5863.32
choice that makes you better and those

5861.219 --> 5865.719
other creatures can at some point also

5863.32 --> 5866.679
get to the point where they choose to be

5865.719 --> 5869.08
better

5866.679 --> 5872.139
so to think of yourself as better than

5869.08 --> 5874.48
somebody else that can do but not if

5872.139 --> 5876.1
it's like a permanent marker

5874.48 --> 5877.48
because of something that they can

5876.1 --> 5879.159000000001
change but if you think you're better

5877.48 --> 5881.58
because of something that they could

5879.159 --> 5881.58
change

5883.08 --> 5890.219
then it's arguably

5887.32 --> 5890.219
functional

5892.659 --> 5896.0199999999995
right

5893.8 --> 5899.38
if you think of somebody

5896.02 --> 5901.900000000001
as lesser just because of their

5899.38 --> 5903.34
who they how they who they how they were

5901.9 --> 5904.9
born

5903.34 --> 5909.0
like

5904.9 --> 5909.0
because of their family root or whatever

5909.82 --> 5913.12
yeah that's just straight out

5911.44 --> 5915.759999999999
discrimination because they can never do

5913.12 --> 5917.98
anything to change that

5915.76 --> 5919.780000000001
but yeah if people choose really stupid

5917.98 --> 5921.5199999999995
things in their lives and it's like

5919.78 --> 5923.259999999999
logical

5921.52 --> 5925.360000000001
that that's stupid

5923.26 --> 5927.76
then yeah you can think of yourself as

5925.36 --> 5930.5199999999995
better than them because you are acting

5927.76 --> 5933.1
better than them but that could still

5930.52 --> 5935.7390000000005
change you could [ __ ] up and then become

5933.1 --> 5938.38
just as bad and while they could get

5935.739 --> 5940.78
over it and then become better and then

5938.38 --> 5943.179
naturally they're better than you

5940.78 --> 5944.739
can happen right it all depends on

5943.179 --> 5947.56

5944.739 --> 5950.98

6052.8 --> 6060.12
it didn't show the uh the first sentence

6057.239 --> 6063.199
in the top chat so I was thinking like

6060.12 --> 6063.199
what the hell are you talking about

6077.159 --> 6081.0
majority of gays have been abused as

6079.199 --> 6085.099999999999

6081.0 --> 6085.1
it's kind of the antecedent

6087.78 --> 6093.259999999999
like nobody

6090.3 --> 6096.0
Nobody by their own volition without

6093.26 --> 6098.46
strict suggestion from the outside

6096.0 --> 6101.0

nobody

6110.159 --> 6114.78
yeah I mean

6111.9 --> 6117.96
people tried to convince me that I was

6114.78 --> 6121.139
gay when I was young why because I could

6117.96 --> 6123.9
like feel very serious Revere and love

6121.139 --> 6127.5
and admiration for a man

6123.9 --> 6128.879999999999
it's like wow that was like really like

6127.5 --> 6132.36
feel like

6128.88 --> 6134.46
like this intense feeling

6132.36 --> 6136.5
and but I didn't really understand that

6134.46 --> 6137.88
and other people thought that that was

6136.5 --> 6141.739
gay

6137.88 --> 6141.7390000000005
because I wasn't stoic

6142.98 --> 6148.5
and it's really like people from the

6145.26 --> 6150.84
Mediterranean region Spanish that really

6148.5 --> 6153.6
got that part of me that because they

6150.84 --> 6156.119000000001
were like they're very expressive a lot

6153.6 --> 6157.619000000001
of them and they would hog and kiss each

6156.119 --> 6159.96
other on the cheek and it would be like

6157.619 --> 6161.82
yes yes that's how you're supposed to do

6159.96 --> 6164.34
it

6161.82 --> 6166.44
so they would never call me gay because

6164.34 --> 6169.400000000001
I'm not gay and they didn't they didn't

6166.44 --> 6169.4
see that as such

6172.739 --> 6177.259999999999
that's just them projecting their closet

6175.02 --> 6181.26
in yes it's because they were probably

6177.26 --> 6183.84
so blinded by my unbelievable Divine

6181.26 --> 6185.52
appearance that they just realized that

6183.84 --> 6188.2390000000005
they were gay

6185.52 --> 6188.2390000000005

6193.44 --> 6197.879999999999
I mean I used to be pretty damn

6195.239 --> 6199.98
attractive when I was in my 20s I really

6197.88 --> 6202.92
was

6199.98 --> 6207.08
I mean I'm still kinda

6202.92 --> 6207.08
but I was like really good looking then

6207.54 --> 6213.3
and I often felt like damn it I wasted

6210.78 --> 6214.8
a time so badly there's so much I could

6213.3 --> 6217.5
have done

6214.8 --> 6219.900000000001

6217.5 --> 6222.179
haven't I found myself like being an

6219.9 --> 6225.48
actor in a movie man I

6222.179 --> 6229.32
like I'm wasting like my most beautiful

6225.48 --> 6232.0199999999995
time it's never gonna come back probably

6229.32 --> 6234.9
yeah I was a little bit full of myself

6232.02 --> 6237.56
but I mean come on

6234.9 --> 6237.5599999999995

attractive Wizards out there

6248.219 --> 6253.94
most Wizards are kind of ugly ugly and

6251.52 --> 6253.9400000000005
Nerdy

6257.82 --> 6262.46
anyway I don't know where the hell this

6260.159 --> 6262.46
is going

6265.739 --> 6270.54
I completely forgot about my Illuminati

6268.8 --> 6274.639
kill song damn it it's just all cold now

6270.54 --> 6274.639
I'm gonna have to warm that up

6274.86 --> 6278.239
not super hungry anyway

6286.98 --> 6293.159
I would play a great villain yes

6290.58 --> 6296.699
it's always good guys that play the most

6293.159 --> 6300.0
intense villains did you know that

6296.699 --> 6302.04
you know why that is it's because

6300.0 --> 6305.1
they can

6302.04 --> 6307.26
like pour all their hatred in their

6305.1 --> 6310.02
malice in it like the one ring right

6307.26 --> 6313.139
that idea well a good person that's

6310.02 --> 6315.719
actually really good still has other

6313.139 --> 6317.46
sides that are under pronounced

6315.719 --> 6318.9
underdeveloped it's probably for the

6317.46 --> 6322.26
best

6318.9 --> 6327.119
or kept in the secret because of the

6322.26 --> 6329.34
yeah in favor of the good side right but

6327.119 --> 6332.119
they still have that other side and so

6329.34 --> 6335.159000000001
for actors can be like enormously

6332.119 --> 6336.599999999999
accelerating or relieving to play that

6335.159 --> 6340.799999999999
dark side

6336.6 --> 6344.34
because they get to be it like without

6340.8 --> 6346.8
it ruining everything

6344.34 --> 6348.4800000000005
or like damaging the reputation or

6346.8 --> 6349.9800000000005
anything and then they can play it out

6348.48 --> 6352.379999999999
for a bit

6349.98 --> 6355.218999999999
yeah I could damn well play an

6352.38 --> 6355.219
interesting villain

6364.86 --> 6369.719
I know I'd probably play like this

6367.44 --> 6370.919999999999
terrible psychological warfare person

6369.719 --> 6374.179
that just

6370.92 --> 6374.179
gets to you

6374.639 --> 6379.5
like mix I like I'd love to play that

6377.34 --> 6383.78
type of villain that makes you like him

6379.5 --> 6383.78
even though you know you shouldn't

6385.98 --> 6392.119
role playing smooth and screw you

6389.04 --> 6392.119
how is that interesting

6392.28 --> 6397.139
yeah I can play Smeagol it's not

6394.619 --> 6399.36
difficult at all for me but

6397.139 --> 6401.35
there's only so much you can do with it

6399.36 --> 6404.409
you know

6401.35 --> 6404.409000000001
[Music]

6408.36 --> 6414.119

6411.6 --> 6417.679
talking about Mark Allard

6436.679 --> 6443.28
a role as they are winning no

6439.92 --> 6446.04
but I hate that don't it's not Armenian

6443.28 --> 6449.48
yeah I will never use Arwin for a

6446.04 --> 6449.48
[ __ ] villain name it isn't

6457.8 --> 6459.8
it

6471.38 --> 6475.82
do School Musical no

6476.28 --> 6479.84
no school musicals

6481.5 --> 6486.78
I mean there was like singing on stage

6484.02 --> 6489.2390000000005
is like a choir thingy singing

6486.78 --> 6491.4
done that

6489.239 --> 6493.379999999999
just like you're standing in a row and

6491.4 --> 6495.42
you're singing some song together like

6493.38 --> 6498.42
that's the thing that I did do I also

6495.42 --> 6500.46
did a couple of school plays but no

6498.42 --> 6503.2390000000005
musicals

6500.46 --> 6503.2390000000005

6521.58 --> 6526.09
of gay that it has left

6523.679 --> 6529.56
in your spirit

6526.09 --> 6533.119000000001
[Music]

6529.56 --> 6533.119000000001
main character role yeah

6536.88 --> 6543.02
yeah that definitely explains a few

6540.179 --> 6543.02
things except happy

6547.679 --> 6552.06
especially because you remember all

6549.84 --> 6553.7390000000005
those things and I'm feel I'm having a

6552.06 --> 6555.119000000001
sense that you're actually secretly

6553.739 --> 6557.759999999999
proud of it

6555.119 --> 6560.179
so yeah it is definitely left its mark

6557.76 --> 6560.179
on you

6560.83 --> 6564.239
[Music]

6562.32 --> 6566.96
I was 11 yeah

6564.239 --> 6566.959999999999
I know

6567.9 --> 6573.42
well as a memory like that when I was

6570.719 --> 6575.58
eight I played the Sheriff of Nottingham

6573.42 --> 6577.56
in a Robin Hood

6575.58 --> 6581.1
play

6577.56 --> 6583.8
I played it with a real metal sword that

6581.1 --> 6585.6
I got from my dad who collected those

6583.8 --> 6587.6
things

6585.6 --> 6587.6
um

6589.8 --> 6595.38
yeah

6590.96 --> 6600.84
not solo role in a musical no I actually

6595.38 --> 6602.6990000000005
wielded a real sword wasn't sharpened on

6600.84 --> 6604.619000000001
a stage play and I was the only one the

6602.699 --> 6606.239
rest had a virtue wouldn't sort yeah I

6604.619 --> 6608.46
had an actual sword but I was the

6606.239 --> 6610.259999999999
Sheriff of Nottingham so I was supposed

6608.46 --> 6615.6
to look richer

6610.26 --> 6618.38
yeah that's my very very non-gay role

6615.6 --> 6618.38
that I played

6621.239 --> 6625.259999999999
also I was the only kid that could

6623.219 --> 6627.9800000000005
actually speak English

6625.26 --> 6627.9800000000005
Audible

6628.619 --> 6632.48
because the rest was all all those pots

6631.32 --> 6635.4
and pens

6632.48 --> 6637.638999999999
and I was like no I I can actually talk

6635.4 --> 6637.638999999999
English

6638.46 --> 6643.4
that it's that you can actually hear

6640.56 --> 6643.400000000001
what I'm saying

6649.199 --> 6654.178999999999
that American Sheriff oh dude

6652.92 --> 6657.8
uh

6654.179 --> 6657.8
Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz

6676.92 --> 6681.78
no I'm I do great as a Sheriff of

6679.08 --> 6684.48
Nottingham because I could I could uh

6681.78 --> 6686.699
act like a dominating bastard

6684.48 --> 6690.739
absolutely

6686.699 --> 6690.739
I did I was the villain in that play

6693.719 --> 6697.619
and for me it was super exhilarating

6695.94 --> 6701.28
because it's the only time I could

6697.619 --> 6703.92
actually act dominating without all the

6701.28 --> 6706.5
kids immediately swerving me trying to

6703.92 --> 6709.32
bully me into submission

6706.5 --> 6712.02
because like every [ __ ] person there

6709.32 --> 6714.619
was afraid of me

6712.02 --> 6714.619000000001
foreign

6714.78 --> 6719.34
times

6716.82 --> 6722.46
just as soon as I started to actually

6719.34 --> 6725.639
show how I was and what like the quality

6722.46 --> 6727.56
of intellect that I had like immediately

6725.639 --> 6729.659000000001
everybody would start [ __ ] their

6727.56 --> 6732.0
pants

6729.659 --> 6734.54
met the fork we not literally but I mean

6732.0 --> 6734.54
serious

6735.6 --> 6740.280000000001
because I was just [ __ ] smarter than

6738.179 --> 6741.36
everybody else there like all the other

6740.28 --> 6745.679
kids

6741.36 --> 6748.259999999999
like I would go to teachers during break

6745.679 --> 6750.96
to try to have actual intellectual

6748.26 --> 6753.119000000001
discussions because the everybody else

6750.96 --> 6755.46
in the school the kids were all [ __ ]

6753.119 --> 6757.679
[ __ ] they were just playing like

6755.46 --> 6759.2390000000005
domination games like who could be a

6757.679 --> 6761.9400000000005
bigger badass

6759.239 --> 6764.099999999999
who's not gonna Flinch and like you're

6761.94 --> 6768.98

6806.46 --> 6813.54
bit more cohesive and not just like

6809.159 --> 6813.54

6829.38 --> 6832.400000000001

6935.58 --> 6939.08
wisdom here I'm a fascist

6942.06 --> 6948.119000000001
specifically was about Paul oh okay yeah

I don't know what other poll you're

6953.46 --> 6959.639
talking about here because

6956.1 --> 6962.639
nobody in this chat actually has the

6959.639 --> 6964.56
YouTube handle of Paul so I was

6962.639 --> 6968.900000000001
literally assuming you were talking to

6964.56 --> 6968.900000000001
me since Paul is my first name

6983.82 --> 6989.099999999999

7023.0 --> 7027.8
Happy

7024.38 --> 7030.4400000000005
I think that that School Musical

7027.8 --> 7034.119000000001
role you're so proud of has really

7030.44 --> 7034.119
started to rub off on you

7045.31 --> 7049.42
[Music]

7047.119 --> 7049.42
okay

7050.42 --> 7055.639
well that stuff talking like one

7053.119 --> 7057.86
zap tappy

7055.639 --> 7060.92
you never kissed a guy yes but you did

7057.86 --> 7064.239
play the main role in a musical as a kid

7060.92 --> 7064.2390000000005
and you're still proud of it

7076.099 --> 7081.860000000001
yeah at least I have empirical proof

7078.56 --> 7084.7390000000005
that indefinitely not homosexual because

7081.86 --> 7087.139
it makes me throw up yeah

7084.739 --> 7089.36
you don't have that proof you didn't do

7087.139 --> 7091.46
the main play School Musical you're like

7089.36 --> 7093.799999999999
yes I did it and now I realize it's

7091.46 --> 7096.26
really gay and better just leave it

7093.8 --> 7101.06
alone no you're still proud of it yeah

7096.26 --> 7103.4800000000005
sounds like you had another result than

7101.06 --> 7103.4800000000005
me

7104.719 --> 7109.2390000000005
yeah that's right

7106.219 --> 7109.2390000000005
so there you go

7109.94 --> 7115.4
yeah I didn't kiss that guy and then

7112.099 --> 7118.099
realized damn I kind of like this yeah

7115.4 --> 7121.36
no I was like I'm never doing that again

7118.099 --> 7125.179
yeah you did the main

7121.36 --> 7125.96
role in a musical and you're still proud

7125.179 --> 7128.36
of it

7125.96 --> 7131.38
sounds like you had another result than

7128.36 --> 7131.38
me is that happy

7136.219 --> 7141.199
and

7138.32 --> 7143.179
I hope you realize I am kind of joking

7141.199 --> 7146.178999999999
with you

7143.179 --> 7147.9800000000005
yeah I'm not actually saying that you're

7146.179 --> 7150.56
literally gay don't worry about I'm

7147.98 --> 7152.9
playing with you but I mean come on

7150.56 --> 7156.02
you're you're literally proud of being

7152.9 --> 7160.9
the red role in the musical The you

7156.02 --> 7160.900000000001
gotta realize what that means right

7161.26 --> 7166.820000000001
like I'm not proud that I kissed that

7164.54 --> 7169.94
guy in order to find out that I was gay

7166.82 --> 7172.28
yeah it still haunts me it's still

7169.94 --> 7175.219
embarrassing and when people say oh

7172.28 --> 7177.139
that's gay then I'm

7175.219 --> 7179.06
because I know in a way it is right and

7177.139 --> 7182.179
I'm stupid enough that I didn't just

7179.06 --> 7184.88
know before that moment

7182.179 --> 7187.219
that it was like confused to the point

7184.88 --> 7189.7390000000005
that I had to test that on an empirical

7187.219 --> 7192.139
level just to be sure

7189.739 --> 7195.879999999999
if you blame me for being gay about that

7192.139 --> 7195.88
then fair enough

7196.46 --> 7201.219
but I definitely know I'm not homosexual

7206.84 --> 7213.4400000000005
nothing wrong about songs about Jesus in

7209.78 --> 7213.44

7278.48 --> 7281.678999999999
just getting better and better

7286.099 --> 7291.860000000001
I mean I've been berated for like not

7289.52 --> 7294.080000000001
agreeing about things in the Bible but I

7291.86 --> 7295.098999999999
never like mocked it

7294.08 --> 7297.86
yeah

7295.099 --> 7301.099
even when I I didn't understand it I

7297.86 --> 7304.179
didn't consider myself a Believer okay I

7301.099 --> 7304.179
still had the respect

7304.639 --> 7311.42
so yeah this is zap tapi I mean

7308.659 --> 7313.699
seriously have you really ever

7311.42 --> 7315.88
considered that you might actually be

7313.699 --> 7315.879999999999
gay

7317.36 --> 7321.92
ask the teachers too many questions

7320.36 --> 7324.759999999999
yeah

7321.92 --> 7326.78
and that probably you probably

7324.76 --> 7330.56
accidentally brought out their

7326.78 --> 7333.139
suppressed gay nature

7330.56 --> 7334.280000000001
and they didn't like that

7333.139 --> 7338.1990000000005
yeah

7334.28 --> 7338.199
you brought out the gay in them

7340.58 --> 7344.84
and you probably didn't realize it

7342.38 --> 7348.58
because you've been like 50 gay all your

7344.84 --> 7348.58
life and you never even realized it

7357.56 --> 7363.400000000001
again I'm messing with you by the way

7360.199 --> 7363.4
and I'm projecting

7364.28 --> 7369.159
because that is kind of what it was like

7366.08 --> 7369.159
for me and sometimes

7369.619 --> 7372.159
uh

7373.699 --> 7376.9
I'm sorry beautiful yeah

7377.02 --> 7385.2390000000005
oh how dare you

7380.9 --> 7389.08
oh how dare you

7385.239 --> 7392.299999999999
oh how dare you

7389.08 --> 7395.599
I love that clip that Owen

7392.3 --> 7400.119000000001
plucked off the internet

7395.599 --> 7400.119000000001
anybody see that so that's so funny

7401.239 --> 7407.08
uh

7402.92 --> 7407.08
probably okay yeah yeah yeah

7408.199 --> 7414.08
I love it though I mean South Park is

7410.48 --> 7417.08
like it is the series

7414.08 --> 7420.739
that got away with presenting the truth

7417.08 --> 7423.94
as a joke and everybody accepted it

7420.739 --> 7423.94
on a fractal level

7426.08 --> 7430.94
South Park I mean it used to be really

7428.3 --> 7433.099
brilliant it's still fair enough but I

7430.94 --> 7435.799999999999
mean it's like cocked and shaved off its

7433.099 --> 7437.659000000001
Edge so it's just a bit blunted down now

7435.8 --> 7438.56
it's not we're gonna be what it used to

7437.659 --> 7441.259999999999
be

7438.56 --> 7445.639
but I mean that episode

7441.26 --> 7449.96
about the bikers how they're [ __ ] right

7445.639 --> 7453.4400000000005
it was revolutionary for me to see that

7449.96 --> 7454.88
since then I've been calling bikers that

7453.44 --> 7457.46
are loud

7454.88 --> 7461.32
I call them facts

7457.46 --> 7461.32
and I'll call them facts to their face

7467.599 --> 7471.26
and I'll explain it why

7470.119 --> 7474.92
right

7471.26 --> 7477.9800000000005
but I mean that was the episode where

7474.92 --> 7480.92
the priest literally had that sign God

7477.98 --> 7483.82
hates facts

7480.92 --> 7483.82
amazing

7484.28 --> 7488.599
it's like

7485.739 --> 7491.54
you dared

7488.599 --> 7494.38
and he was glorious

7491.54 --> 7494.38
and true

7508.82 --> 7514.46
want to do this yeah that's yeah that's

7511.699 --> 7516.379999999999
fact speech yeah I hate fact speech too

7514.46 --> 7518.599
it's really annoying

7516.38 --> 7522.38
you can turn it off and on too it's like

7518.599 --> 7524.360000000001
a thing it's like lizard speech

7522.38 --> 7526.88
some people call it it's like lizard

7524.36 --> 7529.42
speech a gay stalk they talk like

7526.88 --> 7529.42
lizards

7538.88 --> 7545.5
when he said ah all right

7542.239 --> 7545.5
yeah thanks no worries

7549.32 --> 7556.0599999999995
yes I got it thank you very much for the

7552.26 --> 7556.06
support I really appreciate that

7570.08 --> 7572.139
um

7584.42 --> 7589.34
if you bring out the gay in people maybe

7586.88 --> 7591.9800000000005
that's a way of beginning to cleanse

7589.34 --> 7593.719
them yes it's like an exorcism

7591.98 --> 7597.098999999999
yeah

7593.719 --> 7597.099
it's not even a joke

7597.38 --> 7604.159000000001
I genuinely think that gay that that

7600.92 --> 7606.26
thing that that is literally a demonic

7604.159 --> 7609.08
spirit

7606.26 --> 7611.659000000001
I really think that

7609.08 --> 7615.08
that you can get possessed by gayness

7611.659 --> 7617.0599999999995
like that it's like giving into it and

7615.08 --> 7619.96
then you go on to that other format

7617.06 --> 7619.96
that's not natural

7625.639 --> 7630.9400000000005
gay sources okie dokie

7632.3 --> 7636.9400000000005
gain is eliminated what the [ __ ]

7638.659 --> 7641.5599999999995
uh

7642.98 --> 7651.678999999999
uh well Marco that's interesting because

7648.199 --> 7653.839999999999
well there are gay influencing

7651.679 --> 7658.52
things right like

7653.84 --> 7662.0
uh atrazine bisphenol a in plastic

7658.52 --> 7665.9800000000005
and it can be that basically Ivermectin

7662.0 --> 7669.32
helps your body Purge itself of those

7665.98 --> 7672.259999999999
gayifying influences soy in your system

7669.32 --> 7675.58
this feeling atrazine it might actually

7672.26 --> 7675.58
help clean it up

7676.4 --> 7681.44
and in that sense help it might be true

7679.46 --> 7683.119
I don't know I I have not looked into

7681.44 --> 7685.879999999999
that

7683.119 --> 7689.0
but I mean you don't become gay because

7685.88 --> 7691.34
a microorganism gets in your cell

7689.0 --> 7694.82
structure or your blood

7691.34 --> 7697.04
and that influences you to then give in

7694.82 --> 7699.4
to the gay demon or something that's not

7697.04 --> 7699.4
the case

7700.34 --> 7705.8
but your system can be influenced like

7703.28 --> 7708.0199999999995
hormonally so that you become more

7705.8 --> 7711.08
susceptible

7708.02 --> 7715.46
that is a thing

7711.08 --> 7718.159
and yeah if you clean yourself of those

7715.46 --> 7721.599
influences that do that to you

7718.159 --> 7721.598999999999
then you effectively

7722.36 --> 7729.759999999999
yeah take the gate away you cleanse the

7725.3 --> 7729.76
gay away the gay influences

7733.88 --> 7738.02
so I don't know if I've remectin does

7736.52 --> 7742.06
that

7738.02 --> 7742.06
that might just be a rumor I mean

7751.46 --> 7756.219
is I correcting from a fungus I don't

7754.099 --> 7756.219
know

7756.56 --> 7762.219
thank you

7758.3 --> 7762.219
I don't remember what it was made from

7765.619 --> 7771.339999999999
the Romans were super gay

7767.96 --> 7771.34
a lot of them yeah

7787.76 --> 7791.4400000000005

8069.719 --> 8075.52
obsess over sexually

8073.239 --> 8077.138999999999
really Aries where are you getting that

8075.52 --> 8080.56
from

8077.139 --> 8082.3
what about the ancient Egyptians Aries

8080.56 --> 8085.4800000000005
106.

8082.3 --> 8088.079000000001
pretty sure they were very obsessed with

8085.48 --> 8088.079
sexuality

8091.3 --> 8095.860000000001
tell me a little joke yeah a little lame

8093.579 --> 8098.799999999999
joke

8095.86 --> 8100.719
it's like oh it's only me kind of

8098.8 --> 8103.84
ridiculing this show it's just a little

8100.719 --> 8106.84
joke yeah it's a little stupid joke

8103.84 --> 8110.9800000000005
Moxie it's not funny

8106.84 --> 8112.84
are you trying to make your bad habits

8110.98 --> 8117.36
Sprout up again

8112.84 --> 8117.360000000001

reserve your jokes for actual subjects

8158.38 --> 8160.9800000000005
foreign

8167.739 --> 8171.36
yeah but that's not the same thing now

8169.84 --> 8174.599
is it

8171.36 --> 8178.739
sexuality is

8174.599 --> 8183.54
heterosexual homosexual yeah that

8178.739 --> 8188.459999999999
gender because that's a 18th century

8183.54 --> 8188.46
construct that comes from psychology

8192.16 --> 8198.7
so yeah they didn't

8195.46 --> 8201.16
get obsessed over a social construct

8198.7 --> 8203.62
because that didn't exist

8201.16 --> 8205.24
but they were damn well getting obsessed

8203.62 --> 8207.460000000001
over sexuality

8205.24 --> 8210.46
better believe it

8207.46 --> 8214.678999999998
look at the Romans look at the Greek

8210.46 --> 8214.678999999998
look at the Egyptians yeah

8222.88 --> 8228.719
talk [ __ ] about entering dude they

8228.719 --> 8234.699999999999
ares106 there's literally ancient

8232.54 --> 8237.7
depictions

8234.7 --> 8237.7
murals

8238.5 --> 8245.92
of that stuff yeah in architecture

8243.099 --> 8248.139000000001
is right there

8245.92 --> 8252.059
they didn't have to talk [ __ ] about it

8291.639 --> 8295.598999999998
show

8293.74 --> 8296.8
don't know what exactly I'm talking

8295.599 --> 8300.42
about

8296.8 --> 8300.42
what the hell am I gonna call this thing

8302.32 --> 8307.8
I'm not being so super esoteric as I was

8305.559 --> 8307.8
yesterday

8310.719 --> 8313.919999999998
although I was a bit

8331.42 --> 8337.389
okay

[Music]

8339.92 --> 8346.17

8366.88 --> 8369.598999999998
what

8375.219 --> 8378.219
foreign

8400.0 --> 8404.1
okay it's an army

8404.56 --> 8411.6
of ancient troops

8407.859 --> 8411.6
male lovers yeah

8422.939 --> 8431.16
so it's like a gay army

8427.18 --> 8431.16
yeah not too surprised

8432.22 --> 8435.22
laughs

8439.24 --> 8445.42
something and I get I don't want yeah

8441.64 --> 8447.539999999999
but I don't just wanna it has to have a

8445.42 --> 8447.54
point

8447.64 --> 8450.479
foreign

8510.98 --> 8516.939
[Music]

8513.34 --> 8519.06
and of course it's too hot now

8516.939 --> 8519.06
thank you

8539.8 --> 8544.08
yeah not bad Supreme knowing but I mean

8546.34 --> 8551.64
it's not really been the the main point

8549.16 --> 8551.64
of everything

8552.64 --> 8557.439
but it it would prob that would probably

8554.74 --> 8560.8
make a good title for a show where I

8557.439 --> 8563.14
actually do talk about that

8560.8 --> 8565.539999999999
more on point and not just as side note

8563.14 --> 8568.119999999999
because if we've been talking kind of

8565.54 --> 8571.720000000001
jokingly

8568.12 --> 8574.92
about gayness and all that

8571.72 --> 8574.92
[Music]

8593.8 --> 8597.64
maybe something like how it was sitting

8596.08 --> 8602.64
rubs off on you

8597.64 --> 8602.64
that has been like a carrying theme Here

8604.6 --> 8610.15
[Music]

8607.24 --> 8621.01
getting inspired

8610.15 --> 8621.01

foreign

8685.0 --> 8688.1
[Music]

8701.5 --> 8706.02
okay got this it's not good enough yet

8723.74 --> 8729.208999999999
[Music]

8731.35 --> 8742.299
[Music]

8742.66 --> 8746.46
yeah how about this

8748.18 --> 8754.960000000001
if you don't recognize sin but

8752.1 --> 8758.58
exposed to it

8754.96 --> 8758.58
it will rub off on you

8765.1 --> 8769.66
now it's not true though

8767.439 --> 8772.92
because even if you do recognize it it

8769.66 --> 8772.92
will still rub off on you

8783.64 --> 8791.92
to expose yeah this is how I'm gonna do

8786.58 --> 8794.5
it if you expose sin it will still rub

8791.92 --> 8796.78
off on you

8794.5 --> 8801.18
yes that's it

8796.78 --> 8801.18
that's the ways the title is going to be

8803.8 --> 8807.519999999999
because that's the real underlying

8805.84 --> 8811.439
lesson

8807.52 --> 8811.439
and I kind of wanted to communicate

8814.24 --> 8817.26
what do you guys think

8823.01 --> 8827.409
[Music]

8828.16 --> 8831.16
foreign

8841.319 --> 8844.859
there's a better one

8848.1 --> 8855.960000000001
exposing

8850.0 --> 8855.96
sin also spreads sin

8860.5 --> 8864.479
don't know about that

8862.479 --> 8864.479
um

8875.71 --> 8879.599999999999
[Music]

8876.48 --> 8879.6
[Applause]

8887.52 --> 8892.62
exposing sin also spreads it

8895.06 --> 8901.6
right and there's even room for more now

8898.6 --> 8901.6
so

8902.38 --> 8906.0
any supplementals

8909.399 --> 8914.88
that you guys come up with or I come up

8912.1 --> 8914.880000000001
with I can add

8954.819 --> 8960.58
um

8956.46 --> 8963.58
yeah no thanks the Supreme no it's okay

8960.58 --> 8965.56
get like figuring out a good title is

8963.58 --> 8968.38
very complex

8965.56 --> 8972.76
it's not just a sentence

8968.38 --> 8976.0
because it has to encapsulate everything

8972.76 --> 8978.460000000001
you have to really find the essence of

8976.0 --> 8981.64
what you've been doing really

8978.46 --> 8983.919999999998
and try to encapsulate that instead of

8981.64 --> 8985.899
just highlighting him a basic mechanism

8983.92 --> 8988.859
in what happened

8985.899 --> 8988.858999999999
and that's difficult

8989.14 --> 8994.119999999999
quite the art

8991.6 --> 8995.92
and I'm getting better at it because I'm

8994.12 --> 8999.160000000002
taking it so serious

8995.92 --> 9001.62
I'm literally spending 10 minutes live

8999.16 --> 9004.26
on the show trying to figure out what

9001.62 --> 9006.720000000001
the title should be and you've heard

9004.26 --> 9009.359
every step of the way

9006.72 --> 9013.34
so I've shared the very development

9009.359 --> 9013.34
process of making a title

9013.56 --> 9019.56
and now you also can figure out like why

9016.319 --> 9023.16
my titles are kind of good

9019.56 --> 9026.899
is because I keep keep reflecting it

9023.16 --> 9026.899
until it's just right

9027.09 --> 9032.139000000001
[Music]

9032.22 --> 9038.099999999999
but you almost always have to basically

9035.52 --> 9040.140000000001
make a couple of mistakes make a couple

9038.1 --> 9043.2
of suggestions before you can even

9040.14 --> 9046.74
figure out the perfect title

9043.2 --> 9048.899000000001
right how many times do I actually like

9046.74 --> 9050.34
immediately come up with the perfect

9048.899 --> 9052.14
title

9050.34 --> 9055.319
most of the times I come up with the

9052.14 --> 9058.16
title I kinda change it around or change

9055.319 --> 9058.16
it last minute

9058.56 --> 9063.42
it's very rare that I just immediately

9060.899 --> 9064.68
get the title and it's absolutely

9063.42 --> 9066.78
perfect

9064.68 --> 9068.58
that's very rare

9066.78 --> 9072.26
it's usually a few steps in between

9068.58 --> 9072.26
before I get to it

9075.24 --> 9077.359
um

9077.94 --> 9088.52
[Music]

9093.84 --> 9100.02
but it is cool because now the title

9097.2 --> 9102.26
it's like a piece of it's a key piece of

9100.02 --> 9104.640000000001
information you see because

9102.26 --> 9107.34
it's literally true the title is

9104.64 --> 9109.68
literally true exposing scene also

9107.34 --> 9112.68
spreads it and it applies to everything

9109.68 --> 9114.78
so you can see it you can just see the

9112.68 --> 9117.84
title all right you don't have to click

9114.78 --> 9119.460000000001
on the show watch all of it

9117.84 --> 9123.66
you could just

9119.46 --> 9125.819
poop in your mind see that one sentence

9123.66 --> 9127.74
and suddenly connect just that one

9125.819 --> 9130.8
sentence without actually even having

9127.74 --> 9133.74
seen the video just at one sentence and

9130.8 --> 9136.039999999999
you're like oh this oh yeah that oh this

9133.74 --> 9136.039999999999
yeah

9136.38 --> 9141.259999999998
and suddenly it applies to almost

9138.66 --> 9141.26
everything

9142.62 --> 9147.78
and that's the real art of a good title

9145.2 --> 9149.52
is you say something that applies to

9147.78 --> 9153.359
everything

9149.52 --> 9154.68
but that not everybody has thought of

9153.359 --> 9156.42
before

9154.68 --> 9161.7
to that degree

9156.42 --> 9163.859
or nobody's said it perfectly yet

9161.7 --> 9167.220000000001
so that you like

9163.859 --> 9169.26
give the final polishing to the

9167.22 --> 9171.0
understanding of it that's already going

9169.26 --> 9174.0
around this that's what this is in this

9171.0 --> 9177.54
case because exposing the sin also

9174.0 --> 9179.939
spreads it is a concept that has been

9177.54 --> 9182.160000000002
kind of go around for a while oh and

9179.939 --> 9185.220000000001
Benjamin has really brought forth that

9182.16 --> 9188.66
key piece of wisdom a lot

9185.22 --> 9188.66
but so have I

9188.76 --> 9194.1
before I got to know him by the way it's

9191.22 --> 9196.438999999998
not like I took over that tactic from

9194.1 --> 9199.319
him now I was doing that myself I've

9196.439 --> 9202.02
always been like I I hate this I don't

9199.319 --> 9204.6
want to get into this

9202.02 --> 9207.18
it's disgusting

9204.6 --> 9208.859
it's like I don't care if they attack me

9207.18 --> 9211.319
I don't care

9208.859 --> 9213.18
I just they're not worthy your response

9211.319 --> 9216.6
like that would make things worse for me

9213.18 --> 9220.16
if I responded to it if I start to act

9216.6 --> 9220.16
like I care about that

9220.319 --> 9225.119999999999
and so I just avoided it

9222.78 --> 9226.02
right I've never done that on my show I

9225.12 --> 9229.02
never

9226.02 --> 9231.560000000001
get into angry back and forth with with

9229.02 --> 9231.560000000001
people

9231.72 --> 9235.92
and like do back oh I'm gonna review

9233.819 --> 9237.96
your response to my response and I'm

9235.92 --> 9240.6
going to review your response to my

9237.96 --> 9242.58
response and etc etc and then just

9240.6 --> 9245.880000000001
bickering bicker yeah I don't do that

9242.58 --> 9247.319
people try to do that with my videos and

9245.88 --> 9252.199999999999
then I'm like

9247.319 --> 9252.199999999999
your [ __ ] and I and I don't care

9255.12 --> 9259.560000000001
you know if you want to argue something

9256.56 --> 9262.68
then you have to get into my chat behave

9259.56 --> 9264.899
halfway like a human being and make your

9262.68 --> 9268.800000000001
case and then I'll argue with you

9264.899 --> 9271.92
about it and judge it

9268.8 --> 9274.199999999999
but I'm not gonna go into some bickering

9271.92 --> 9275.16
cycle with some [ __ ] [ __ ] on the

9274.2 --> 9277.5
internet

9275.16 --> 9280.1
that disagrees with me somehow I'm just

9277.5 --> 9280.1
not doing it

9280.53 --> 9283.659000000001
[Music]

9303.24 --> 9308.22
to project that instead of projecting

9306.479 --> 9309.779999999999
itself hate

9308.22 --> 9311.88
what

9309.78 --> 9316.08
right yeah well

9311.88 --> 9318.779999999999
look that's why it says also

9316.08 --> 9321.84
gaining wisdom you see that right

9318.78 --> 9324.18
exposing sin also spreads it it's not

9321.84 --> 9327.54
like exposing sin spreads it that that's

9324.18 --> 9329.52
the thing no it also spreads it though

9327.54 --> 9332.28
there's plenty of people out there

9329.52 --> 9335.880000000001
unfortunately that are just looking for

9332.28 --> 9338.399000000001
to get more dirty and to play onto

9335.88 --> 9340.8
people's

9338.399 --> 9343.26
people natural senses of Getting

9340.8 --> 9345.358999999999
unnerved By something really [ __ ] up

9343.26 --> 9347.64
and and ongoing

9345.359 --> 9349.56
and if you expose something then those

9347.64 --> 9351.96
people will be like oh here's the new

9349.56 --> 9353.76
thing oh I'm gonna talk about it

9351.96 --> 9355.619999999999
when people don't want you to talk about

9353.76 --> 9358.880000000001
it

9355.62 --> 9362.300000000001
yeah it also spreads it makes it it

9358.88 --> 9362.3
normalizes it yeah

9362.399 --> 9370.5
yeah exposing sin also spreads it

9365.34 --> 9370.5
that process is called normalization

9370.979 --> 9375.42
yeah when something becomes a subject

9373.2 --> 9378.18
that is certainly publicly debatable and

9375.42 --> 9381.859
no longer taboo

9378.18 --> 9381.859
then it spreads

9382.38 --> 9386.599999999999
you see

9383.819 --> 9386.6
ah you do

9392.04 --> 9394.04
you do

9413.76 --> 9419.28
yeah and it will always look

9417.0 --> 9422.28
to expose the sin you're always going to

9419.28 --> 9424.74
be re appealing to the better nature of

9422.28 --> 9426.479000000001
people in the face of that sin in the

9424.74 --> 9429.3
hopes that they will have that inner

9426.479 --> 9431.699999999999
right flame that will show the right way

9429.3 --> 9433.858999999999
in response to the sin because that's

9431.7 --> 9436.859
the right counter

9433.859 --> 9438.899000000001
you show the right thing Encounter of

9436.859 --> 9441.24
the sin and that really negates it

9438.899 --> 9444.74
attacking the sin doesn't negate it

9441.24 --> 9444.74
only brings it more attention

9445.38 --> 9450.679999999998
and pity and all that sort of thing

9448.08 --> 9450.68
so

9452.16 --> 9456.66
yeah

9453.66 --> 9458.28
just because exposing sin also express

9456.66 --> 9461.819
it doesn't mean that you should never

9458.28 --> 9464.960000000001
expose sin it's just realize that it

9461.819 --> 9464.96
also spreads it

9465.24 --> 9469.58
but hey sometimes

9467.16 --> 9472.319
before you want to get rid of something

9469.58 --> 9474.6
you have to wake it up so you can

9472.319 --> 9479.1
pinpoint it yeah

9474.6 --> 9481.319
it's like you have a nest of bugs

9479.1 --> 9482.76
in the dirt but you can't make them at

9481.319 --> 9484.5
least they're sitting still you can't

9482.76 --> 9486.899
see where they are and then sometimes

9484.5 --> 9488.52
you have to like boom and then they

9486.899 --> 9489.66
start crawling and now you start to see

9488.52 --> 9493.02
where they are and you can both

9489.66 --> 9495.72
potentially like I don't know

9493.02 --> 9497.399000000001
catch them or squash them because you

9495.72 --> 9500.58
can see them moving now

9497.399 --> 9503.519999999999
but they are spreading

9500.58 --> 9505.56
by their exposure yeah they're now all

9503.52 --> 9507.54
on the move and they realize we're being

9505.56 --> 9509.279999999999
attacked so they're some of them might

9507.54 --> 9511.740000000002
be like more inclined to start

9509.28 --> 9515.460000000001
procreating because of that yeah so

9511.74 --> 9518.58
exposing the sin also spreads this in

9515.46 --> 9523.199999999999
and if you just expose it but you don't

9518.58 --> 9525.3
do anything against the sin but exposure

9523.2 --> 9528.84
then you may actually aggravate it if

9525.3 --> 9531.179999999998
you don't present a solution

9528.84 --> 9536.24
like a palpable

9531.18 --> 9538.92
doable option A solution against the sin

9536.24 --> 9541.08
then you may actually strengthen it

9538.92 --> 9544.08
because then it's like oh we're all

9541.08 --> 9546.42
doomed it's this sin we can't stop it

9544.08 --> 9548.46
we're all doomed

9546.42 --> 9549.479
I was gonna have a demoralizing effect

9548.46 --> 9551.58
then

9549.479 --> 9553.438999999998
it's like oh yeah this keeps happening

9551.58 --> 9554.939
we can't stop it yeah then everybody's

9553.439 --> 9557.880000000001
going to be like [ __ ]

9554.939 --> 9561.42
we're all [ __ ]

9557.88 --> 9564.66
game over man game over

9561.42 --> 9566.34
right so you gotta if you're gonna the

9564.66 --> 9569.06
best solution is if you're gonna expose

9566.34 --> 9571.62
the sin then also

9569.06 --> 9575.58
present the antidote

9571.62 --> 9579.479000000001
the solution for the sin

9575.58 --> 9581.58
so that it increases the percentage of

9579.479 --> 9583.74
response

9581.58 --> 9585.96
in a constructive way in a positive way

9583.74 --> 9588.6
instead of

9585.96 --> 9590.399
surrendering to the sin

9588.6 --> 9592.380000000001
right you got to give the remedy

9590.399 --> 9594.72
alongside it

9592.38 --> 9597.979
that's the best way to prevent the sin

9594.72 --> 9597.979
from actually spreading

9598.41 --> 9601.539999999999
[Music]

9603.359 --> 9609.439
Mexico did an arwen-style Revolution

9606.06 --> 9609.439
against the Spaniards

9610.02 --> 9614.76
oh yeah they slaughtered him

9612.96 --> 9616.858999999999
yeah

9614.76 --> 9619.68
yeah that's also because

9616.859 --> 9622.62
well the Spaniards were pretty [ __ ]

9619.68 --> 9625.26
brutal

9622.62 --> 9628.02
like they hurt people

9625.26 --> 9631.52
a lot if they didn't obey so yeah you

9628.02 --> 9631.52
got a lot of angry blood

9634.68 --> 9639.06
and when there's a lot of anger yeah an

9636.54 --> 9641.34
Armenian style Revolution does actually

9639.06 --> 9643.88
happen

9641.34 --> 9643.880000000001
foreign

9645.12 --> 9651.29
[Music]

9685.62 --> 9692.58
it's kind of weird by the way when

9687.6 --> 9695.76
somebody tells you like oh they did a

9692.58 --> 9698.22
me style Revolution what I've never done

9695.76 --> 9701.52
a style Revolution like that though I I

9698.22 --> 9703.74
know I talk about it and I predict it

9701.52 --> 9707.220000000001
I've never actually done it so it's kind

9703.74 --> 9710.46
of weird to hear you say oh they didn't

9707.22 --> 9713.349999999999
a revolution like yours like uh yeah but

9710.46 --> 9717.139
I haven't actually done it though

9713.35 --> 9717.139000000001
[Music]

9717.899 --> 9723.358999999999
yeah Spanish were very brutal

9721.38 --> 9726.24
and by the way not just to their natives

9723.359 --> 9728.42
they were brutal to their own films as

9726.24 --> 9728.42
well

9731.88 --> 9735.5
they were just brutal to everybody

9766.8 --> 9771.539999999999
right

9768.6 --> 9774.62
yeah I I realized that

9771.54 --> 9774.62
interesting though

9787.2 --> 9795.68
nah A Woman's Club called the kitchen

9791.88 --> 9795.679999999998
that's freaking brilliant man

9801.42 --> 9806.42
I mean that's actually smart that's

9804.06 --> 9806.42
smart

9807.61 --> 9810.739000000001
[Music]

9811.439 --> 9814.399
that's hilarious

9830.28 --> 9834.060000000001
well what do they do there though at

9832.14 --> 9836.819
that Women's Club do they actually learn

9834.06 --> 9839.3
womenly things

9836.819 --> 9842.64
or is it kind of a lesbian Club hangout

9839.3 --> 9844.759999999998
what what am I thinking of what what is

9842.64 --> 9844.76
it

9857.16 --> 9861.479
I mean is it like a Housewives Club type

9859.62 --> 9863.94
thing

9861.479 --> 9869.75
LSG don't leave me like this

9863.94 --> 9869.75
[Music]

9882.96 --> 9891.8
going glass getting right so it is like

9886.979 --> 9891.8
an old-fashioned Women's Club it is

9892.2 --> 9897.859
that yeah cool

9894.3 --> 9897.858999999999
very very cool

9898.02 --> 9903.319000000001
I mean you want to pick up chicks that's

9900.42 --> 9903.319
the place to go

9905.88 --> 9910.399
well if you want to actually find a wife

9907.859 --> 9910.399000000001
that is

9914.939 --> 9917.78
very cool

9922.38 --> 9927.96
they give our free lunch wow

9925.62 --> 9930.319000000001
it almost sounds like a mini Barataria

9927.96 --> 9930.319
or something

9942.28 --> 9945.549
[Music]

9949.74 --> 9952.34
hmm

9960.3 --> 9962.599999999999
okay

9965.64 --> 9969.979
there are no free lunches well

9971.399 --> 9974.358999999999
when there's

9972.66 --> 9976.619999999999
plenty

9974.359 --> 9979.68
you'd be surprised

9976.62 --> 9981.92
yeah when people live the way they

9979.68 --> 9981.92
should

9982.5 --> 9987.78
get busy

9984.84 --> 9989.399
there is so much production

9987.78 --> 9991.979000000001
there's like

9989.399 --> 9993.06
when you actually like go farming and

9991.979 --> 9995.58
all that

9993.06 --> 9997.68
you're gonna have more food than you

9995.58 --> 9999.6
literally can get rid of

9997.68 --> 10001.34
now there's people that have

9999.6 --> 10004.880000000001
Farms

10001.34 --> 10007.880000000001
or like a homesteading type smaller Farm

10004.88 --> 10010.399
they always give stuff away because you

10007.88 --> 10013.16
always have too much

10010.399 --> 10015.38
so you'd be surprised I could definitely

10013.16 --> 10016.46
believe free lunches would happen in a

10015.38 --> 10017.479
place like that

10016.46 --> 10020.479
because

10017.479 --> 10022.938999999998
they're practicing cooking all the time

10020.479 --> 10024.38
that's probably like from their own grow

10022.939 --> 10027.92
growing

10024.38 --> 10030.019999999999
that they have over like what are they

10027.92 --> 10032.899
gonna do just throw it away on the

10030.02 --> 10036.08
compost compost heap

10032.899 --> 10037.64
oh there are probably free lunches I

10036.08 --> 10040.039999999999
could definitely believe that in a place

10037.64 --> 10042.26
like that I mean if it's like in the

10040.04 --> 10044.78
middle of a city and some snobbish

10042.26 --> 10046.7
restaurant or we're so modern yeah if

10044.78 --> 10049.1
they'd give away free lunches now that

10046.7 --> 10050.960000000001
would be [ __ ] suspicious

10049.1 --> 10053.899000000001
right

10050.96 --> 10056.3
but not in an old-fashioned Women's Club

10053.899 --> 10057.858999999999
where they learn old-fashioned women

10056.3 --> 10060.14
skills

10057.859 --> 10062.800000000001
no I definitely believe that they had

10060.14 --> 10062.8
free lunches

10063.319 --> 10068.08
that were actually free I would

10065.18 --> 10068.08
definitely believe that

10070.8 --> 10078.58
[Music]

10080.359 --> 10085.399000000001
it's a greedy person screed well it's a

10083.24 --> 10087.8
grappler's grade

10085.399 --> 10089.479
right and it's also like if a little

10087.8 --> 10090.56
grabblers around if everybody's like

10089.479 --> 10092.779999999999
trying to

10090.56 --> 10095.18
pull that money out of your pocket all

10092.78 --> 10098.18
the time yeah there's probably not going

10095.18 --> 10100.880000000001
to be just the easy free stuff

10098.18 --> 10104.06
there'd be a price tag in secret behind

10100.88 --> 10105.92
it in places where everybody's trying to

10104.06 --> 10108.319
always suck the money out of you

10105.92 --> 10110.479
continually like parasites

10108.319 --> 10111.5
when it's fully graveled

10110.479 --> 10113.899
right

10111.5 --> 10117.02
but if it's not fully graveled and

10113.899 --> 10119.479
people live old-fashioned with god with

10117.02 --> 10122.12
good

10119.479 --> 10124.88
roles of the Sexes and all that and a

10122.12 --> 10127.399000000001
functional production then there is

10124.88 --> 10129.8
Surplus there is prosperity there are

10127.399 --> 10132.38
free lunches

10129.8 --> 10134.779999999999
so it's all about

10132.38 --> 10137.259999999998
What scenario are you getting these free

10134.78 --> 10139.819000000001
lunches in

10137.26 --> 10142.54
it's all about the scenario not about

10139.819 --> 10142.539999999999
the free lunch

10155.6 --> 10160.84
while reaching three hour marks soon

10161.42 --> 10165.859
have I not delivered

10163.7 --> 10167.54
a three-hour show again I think it's

10165.859 --> 10170.12
standard now in the weekends that I do

10167.54 --> 10172.359
that I have no problem with it right

10170.12 --> 10172.359
away

10172.52 --> 10175.42
actually doing it

10180.62 --> 10184.54
and Chad is so active these days

10185.359 --> 10192.37
so I'm having a great time hmm

10188.05 --> 10192.369999999999
[Music]

10205.34 --> 10208.34
foreign

10227.899 --> 10230.08
foreign

10239.0 --> 10242.979
you have mixed feelings about what

10257.84 --> 10260.56
hmm

10272.66 --> 10280.24
oh yes I got the supplement

10276.68 --> 10283.27
exposing sin also spreads it

10280.24 --> 10283.27
[Music]

10285.319 --> 10291.16
make sure to add a solution

10299.12 --> 10302.140000000001
what do you guys think

10311.06 --> 10314.06
foreign

10319.6 --> 10324.04
weather exclamation mark actually

10325.22 --> 10329.858999999999
because it's really important that you

10327.56 --> 10329.859
do that

10341.75 --> 10344.95
[Music]

10347.38 --> 10352.0
exposing truth also spreads it

10352.34 --> 10358.279
yeah

10354.8 --> 10361.399
but that's the issue is is that

10358.279 --> 10363.439
exposing sin and exposing the truth are

10361.399 --> 10367.16
not mutually exclusive

10363.439 --> 10369.14
so it's an angle of perspective

10367.16 --> 10372.26
from The Observer and how they're

10369.14 --> 10375.26
approaching this thing right

10372.26 --> 10380.12
because exposing the truth is like in a

10375.26 --> 10383.960000000001
position to hiding something

10380.12 --> 10386.740000000002
but that something can be a sin

10383.96 --> 10386.74
or not

10388.58 --> 10395.12
So when you say exposing the truth it

10391.54 --> 10398.68
automatically emphasizes or

10395.12 --> 10398.68
uh infers

10398.84 --> 10405.08
that there was information being

10401.359 --> 10407.6
withheld right exposing the truth is

10405.08 --> 10409.1
like in opposition to something being

10407.6 --> 10412.220000000001
with health

10409.1 --> 10413.479000000001
that's kept secret you say exposing the

10412.22 --> 10417.56
sin

10413.479 --> 10421.519999999999
that's showing a dark side or adult dark

10417.56 --> 10424.46
result of an ongoing thing

10421.52 --> 10427.58
where it's not necessarily about having

10424.46 --> 10429.919999999998
being kept secret right especially now I

10427.58 --> 10432.02
mean there's a lot of overt sin that's

10429.92 --> 10435.439
just public now they're trying to

10432.02 --> 10438.140000000001
normalize it so it's not about oh

10435.439 --> 10440.720000000001
exposing the truth anymore because

10438.14 --> 10442.66
they're being honest about it

10440.72 --> 10446.08
they're just

10442.66 --> 10446.08
normalizing the sin

10452.06 --> 10458.539999999999
right so exposing the truth isn't always

10455.6 --> 10461.12
the forever so it's not going to be the

10458.54 --> 10463.580000000002
forever solution because

10461.12 --> 10465.979000000001
eventually evil will just become

10463.58 --> 10468.92
truthful they will be truthful about

10465.979 --> 10470.778999999999
their evil and wickedness

10468.92 --> 10472.52
and then you can expose the truth all

10470.779 --> 10475.84
you like nobody will do anything about

10472.52 --> 10475.84
they already know about it

10475.939 --> 10479.74
they just don't know what to do about it

10480.439 --> 10483.439
right

10485.779 --> 10490.939
gotta realize that the world is changing

10488.84 --> 10493.279
this is now different the world is like

10490.939 --> 10496.300000000001
becoming very psychologically different

10493.279 --> 10500.0
from what it was say 30 years ago it's

10496.3 --> 10501.5
really different guys really really

10500.0 --> 10505.58
different

10501.5 --> 10508.1
it's like not recognizable anymore

10505.58 --> 10510.859
if you like go back in time and

10508.1 --> 10513.5
experience that time how it was

10510.859 --> 10516.02
you would feel alien to how everything

10513.5 --> 10519.08
goes there

10516.02 --> 10522.08
because the world has changed so much

10519.08 --> 10524.24
we wouldn't recognize ourselves from

10522.08 --> 10526.039999999999
back then except through our own

10524.24 --> 10528.439
memories that we have left

10526.04 --> 10530.0
which are still idealized because of the

10528.439 --> 10533.319
aesthetic memory that does that

10530.0 --> 10533.319
aesthetic sense that

10533.66 --> 10539.24
turns it into an icon so it's more

10536.12 --> 10541.52
memorable for you right but things have

10539.24 --> 10546.699999999999
become really complicated and we have

10541.52 --> 10550.16
reached a place where now sin is being

10546.7 --> 10552.880000000001
recently shoved to the front and just

10550.16 --> 10558.8
saying like no we are doing this yeah

10552.88 --> 10558.8
that hasn't happened since Caligula

10562.58 --> 10568.18
open

10564.08 --> 10572.899
sin open declared sin hasn't happened

10568.18 --> 10576.14
in roughly a thousand years or so

10572.899 --> 10578.06
more probably a little more so this is

10576.14 --> 10580.399
new people

10578.06 --> 10583.278999999999
do you do you guys realize this

10580.399 --> 10585.56
consciously like that's never happened

10583.279 --> 10588.62
before

10585.56 --> 10592.16
In Like A Thousand Years

10588.62 --> 10595.6
where just be like open blatantly

10592.16 --> 10595.6
recognizable sin

10599.779 --> 10603.859
people

10601.34 --> 10609.64
in the ancient times

10603.859 --> 10609.640000000001
used to kill people for doing that

10609.859 --> 10613.66
and that's why it was so rare

10616.52 --> 10626.479000000001
so realize things work different now

10621.56 --> 10629.479
old tricks of dealing with evil

10626.479 --> 10631.76
have worn off

10629.479 --> 10633.22
the struggle is becoming more

10631.76 --> 10634.819
complicated

10633.22 --> 10638.24
[Music]

10634.819 --> 10640.22
because evil is more Shameless now

10638.24 --> 10644.06
and they're banding together they're

10640.22 --> 10646.42
forming a defense against good which is

10644.06 --> 10646.42
crazy

10647.0 --> 10651.859
it's I mean it's logical but it's crazy

10649.279 --> 10653.779
that we're witnessing that happening it

10651.859 --> 10657.34
is really a special time the sleepers

10653.779 --> 10657.34
and the awakened it is here

10657.92 --> 10661.460000000001
by the way I've seen like

10659.6 --> 10664.04
trailers from

10661.46 --> 10665.72
the new Dune movie looks really

10664.04 --> 10668.42
interesting

10665.72 --> 10670.58
it looks I want to see that one the

10668.42 --> 10673.460000000001
first one was pretty cool too

10670.58 --> 10676.399
the the newer new movie

10673.46 --> 10678.38
I mean it looks really awesome

10676.399 --> 10680.66
and there's more

10678.38 --> 10683.24
apparently there's a new Indiana Jones

10680.66 --> 10685.64
movie that got out

10683.24 --> 10688.479
I've seen a trailer of it it looked

10685.64 --> 10688.479
messy

10688.819 --> 10694.278999999999
like a pretty much a Nostalgia piece I'm

10691.76 --> 10697.1
still curious to see it though

10694.279 --> 10699.58
but I'm hearing a lot of complaints

10697.1 --> 10699.58
about it

10703.34 --> 10707.5
yeah I saw a bunch of trailers yesterday

10707.81 --> 10713.26
[Music]

10709.06 --> 10713.26
definitely looks very interesting

10715.46 --> 10721.339999999998
the new Indiana Jones movie is oh well

10717.979 --> 10724.76
the old one was pretty horrible too

10721.34 --> 10726.76
I mean the Crystal Skull was not exactly

10724.76 --> 10731.06
it was

10726.76 --> 10733.939
entertaining what it was like just not

10731.06 --> 10736.399
right in ways

10733.939 --> 10739.16
like it felt off

10736.399 --> 10741.439
like it was Indiana Jones It's just in

10739.16 --> 10744.38
the wrong era as in

10741.439 --> 10747.319
knock the era in the movie universe but

10744.38 --> 10750.88
the era as in physical reality era like

10747.319 --> 10750.88
it just was so out of place

10753.26 --> 10758.06
but the new one apparently is even worse

10755.84 --> 10760.880000000001
so I've heard I've seen the trailer of

10758.06 --> 10763.278999999999
it it was not super riveting it had

10760.88 --> 10767.199999999999
interesting things

10763.279 --> 10767.2
but I mean I don't know

10770.479 --> 10774.14
people are not going to be very

10771.92 --> 10777.68
nostalgic about it a bit

10774.14 --> 10780.199999999999
oh yeah I also actually saw a just a

10777.68 --> 10781.819
movie on Netflix didn't even know was

10780.2 --> 10783.62
there

10781.819 --> 10786.019999999999
Johnny English

10783.62 --> 10787.399000000001
I've seen that before I've reviewed it I

10786.02 --> 10790.460000000001
actually think it's really freaking

10787.399 --> 10792.979
funny it's very interesting hybrid

10790.46 --> 10795.339999999998
thing and he's done it's like a

10792.979 --> 10797.06
crossover between

10795.34 --> 10799.779
closer

10797.06 --> 10804.38
Mr Bean

10799.779 --> 10808.76
and British spy stuff

10804.38 --> 10811.16
and it's really freaking funny sometimes

10808.76 --> 10813.02
I saw the first two ones like a while

10811.16 --> 10815.3
ago and it was like wow this is actually

10813.02 --> 10818.0
pretty good

10815.3 --> 10820.16
like that's actually witty humor I like

10818.0 --> 10824.18
that well apparently they they're

10820.16 --> 10826.52
pumping them out there's a third one and

10824.18 --> 10828.859
it's even referencing The Pink Panther I

10826.52 --> 10830.960000000001
mean it's called Johnny English strikes

10828.859 --> 10834.2
back that's literally the third Pink

10830.96 --> 10836.0
Panther movie it was called that

10834.2 --> 10838.640000000001
fourth or something

10836.0 --> 10842.5
and it had some really [ __ ] funny

10838.64 --> 10842.5
jokes I mean really funny

10844.819 --> 10848.92
so yeah I'm very entertained by that

10851.899 --> 10855.56
and I also I don't know it's an

10853.7 --> 10857.85
interesting style like how he's actually

10855.56 --> 10859.34
an English teacher

10857.85 --> 10862.34
[Music]

10859.34 --> 10865.22
and a bit is like an English teacher

10862.34 --> 10867.939
Mr Bean that grew up and learn how to

10865.22 --> 10867.938999999998
talk properly

10868.399 --> 10872.06
and trying to be a spy but he's still

10870.68 --> 10873.74
klutz

10872.06 --> 10875.778999999999
glutsy

10873.74 --> 10879.619999999999
that's funny

10875.779 --> 10881.899000000001
and extremely bizarre too I mean they do

10879.62 --> 10884.560000000001
really make it super cartoonish with the

10881.899 --> 10884.56
joke sometimes

10885.439 --> 10891.14
but yeah I watched that too

10888.38 --> 10893.0
yesterday that was it was very mood

10891.14 --> 10895.699999999999
uplifting I mean that is freaking funny

10893.0 --> 10897.62
they got some really dark jokes in there

10895.7 --> 10900.58
too sometimes by the way but so does Mr

10897.62 --> 10900.58
Bean I mean

10901.58 --> 10907.76
and it is a hybrid product after all but

10904.7 --> 10909.439
I mean yeah well done Rowan Atkinson I

10907.76 --> 10911.300000000001
mean

10909.439 --> 10914.42
it

10911.3 --> 10916.039999999999
it's a good new thing that he started

10914.42 --> 10918.26
it's like he probably he was getting

10916.04 --> 10921.560000000001
tired of Mr Bean because he wasn't a

10918.26 --> 10925.64
speaker like a mimic figure

10921.56 --> 10928.399
but he's very about language so

10925.64 --> 10930.5
this is just like the new version of Mr

10928.399 --> 10931.76
Bean and I think it's very end today I

10930.5 --> 10934.18
think it's interesting what he's doing

10931.76 --> 10934.18
with it

10945.92 --> 10950.12
right anyway I think I'm gonna round out

10947.899 --> 10953.119999999999

10969.02 --> 10974.0
but it is funny but so goofy it is

10971.72 --> 10977.08
really for like little kids though it is

10974.0 --> 10977.08
so little kid Goofy

10983.42 --> 10988.7

10985.64 --> 10990.76
