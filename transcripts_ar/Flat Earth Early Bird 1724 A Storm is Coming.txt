91.38 --> 97.5
bit more support until

93.72 --> 99.65899999999999

hello

please support your local Arwin

106.619 --> 111.6
right the weather today is really turned

109.5 --> 113.28
around it's super stormy it's very

111.6 --> 115.14
annoying

113.28 --> 119.04
because my plants are continually

115.14 --> 122.64
getting blown from between the rails I

119.04 --> 124.799
find very aggravating so I'm

122.64 --> 126.479
I think I need to find a piece of

124.799 --> 129.78
elastic

126.479 --> 132.54
and just really keep them stuck to the

129.78 --> 135.86
railing because otherwise they're just

132.54 --> 135.85999999999999
going to keep pinballing

136.58 --> 141.08
my mint plant's not bothered though

141.12 --> 146.54
which is great

143.819 --> 150.0
but yeah the wind is blowing continually

146.54 --> 151.14
and pretty hard

150.0 --> 154.02
yeah

151.14 --> 155.57999999999998
I went out for groceries in this but I

154.02 --> 158.52
mean the temperature is not even that

155.58 --> 159.37900000000002
cold already checked it's 18 degrees I

158.52 --> 163.92000000000002
think

159.379 --> 165.239
everybody's all we're all long pants but

163.92 --> 167.51899999999998
I wasn't

165.239 --> 169.08
I mean I went just in my shorts and

167.519 --> 171.59900000000002
t-shirt and

169.08 --> 174.20000000000002
it's not cold it's just very freaking

171.599 --> 174.2
windy

175.26 --> 177.79999999999998
right

179.28 --> 184.86

181.62 --> 187.5

184.86 --> 190.56
in the evening

187.5 --> 192.239

223.799 --> 231.06
for this type of weather

226.5 --> 232.44
like potatoes with red beets

231.06 --> 235.92000000000002
and

232.44 --> 238.85999999999999
beef sausage with butter gravy and it's

235.92 --> 241.92
like it's a Dutch classic or at least I

238.86 --> 244.799
think it's dutch and it works great oh

241.92 --> 246.379
my god did I literally forget to get tea

249.72 --> 254.04
went out for groceries before the show

251.58 --> 257.34000000000003
and I guess I forget to make tea this is

254.04 --> 259.76

Plus

407.58 --> 412.08
Early Bird shows I've ever actually

409.5 --> 413.46

412.08 --> 417.74
time

413.46 --> 417.73999999999995
weird anyway I'm making it right now

I have I'm not Elvis and I haven't left

432.18 --> 436.5
the building

433.74 --> 438.12
is left to go to the kitchen

436.5 --> 441.18
to make tea

438.12 --> 445.38
and refresh my water because

441.18 --> 446.819
it was also out I mean seriously

445.38 --> 450.319
[Music]

446.819 --> 450.319
chaotic morning for me

450.599 --> 455.4
I feel good though but it seems like

453.06 --> 457.02
it's a bit chaotic and out there people

455.4 --> 460.17999999999995
were also cranky and [ __ ]

457.02 --> 460.18
[Music]

460.199 --> 462.86
so

463.199 --> 465.56
right

468.419 --> 473.71999999999997
I'm here I'm a little late with the show

470.759 --> 473.72
sorry about that

474.9 --> 480.17999999999995
uh there's a good yeah I was thinking it

478.199 --> 482.28000000000003
when if Nathan didn't do a show

480.18 --> 483.72
yesterdays it's very unlikely he's gonna

482.28 --> 487.52
do one today

483.72 --> 490.199
so I kind of aimed

487.52 --> 492.96
and while doing the show late and then

490.199 --> 495.0
being able to continue on

492.96 --> 498.06
because Nathan's not alive so that's

495.0 --> 499.319
kind of what I gambled on

498.06 --> 502.28000000000003
right

499.319 --> 502.28000000000003
when I'm here now

504.84 --> 509.06
how are you guys doing how's the weather

506.52 --> 509.06
over there

510.479 --> 516.479
I think I'm the only one home today

513.539 --> 519.3
why is there no fpd yeah Nathan has like

516.479 --> 521.659
sort of an ear infection thing or

519.3 --> 521.659
something

528.66 --> 535.519
do they add fluoride to the water supply

530.88 --> 539.22
Where I Leave No No that's absolutely

535.519 --> 541.74
not not in the Netherlands at least

539.22 --> 544.22
I think they do it in Switzerland I'm

541.74 --> 544.22
not sure

544.44 --> 549.8000000000001
did hear that a while ago which is

546.6 --> 549.8000000000001
really disturbing went away

553.08 --> 555.6800000000001
but

556.8 --> 563.519
yeah no like a few countries do it in

560.459 --> 565.14
Europe I think but not the Netherlands

563.519 --> 567.12
thank God no

565.14 --> 569.54
now the water quality is actually pretty

567.12 --> 569.54
good here

571.399 --> 575.1
hmm

573.12 --> 577.7
especially in this city I I'm very

575.1 --> 577.7
satisfied

580.5 --> 584.64
it's like I know it's good water because

582.36 --> 587.76
my water filter

584.64 --> 591.019
doesn't get dirty as quick

587.76 --> 591.019
so I know it's good water

597.6 --> 602.0
hello LSG it's you

608.459 --> 612.0799999999999
right so my day yesterday

620.22 --> 625.2
uh there was yeah there wasn't really

622.44 --> 627.839
fvd it was kind of weird

625.2 --> 631.5
the guys did like

627.839 --> 633.86
have a like a call but I missed like all

631.5 --> 633.86
of it

638.779 --> 645.32
uh let's see

641.18 --> 645.3199999999999
what else is going on yesterday

649.97 --> 653.169
[Music]

656.279 --> 659.72
I missed like everything

663.12 --> 666.54
what the hell was I doing I'm gonna go

664.92 --> 667.92
look at my history because I don't

666.54 --> 670.92
remember what the hell I even did

667.92 --> 674.0
yesterday this is just weird

670.92 --> 674.0
let's see

700.14 --> 703.98
oh and Benjamin I was watching on

701.88 --> 706.32
Benjamin he was also alive

703.98 --> 709.22
hilarious

706.32 --> 709.22
uh

711.18 --> 716.399
oh yeah now I remember dude I spend the

713.82 --> 719.1600000000001
whole like hours like cleaning the

716.399 --> 723.0
freaking freezer

719.16 --> 724.98
because like I noticed that hey one of

723.0 --> 727.32
the drawers was actually broken some of

724.98 --> 730.0790000000001
my roommates actually freaking broke my

727.32 --> 730.98
drawer of my freezer I was really pissed

730.079 --> 733.079
off

730.98 --> 735.72
so I'm just like I'm defrosting this

733.079 --> 738.3599999999999
[ __ ] thing I don't care

735.72 --> 740.4590000000001
and that costs a lot of time did work

738.36 --> 742.44
great though

740.459 --> 744.3599999999999
but yeah I still got a broken freezer

742.44 --> 747.98
drawer I'm pissed off about that those

744.36 --> 747.98
things are [ __ ] expensive too

748.76 --> 751.76
foreign

752.18 --> 755.3
of course

759.36 --> 763.04
but I think I know who did it

769.019 --> 772.399
uh right

773.7 --> 778.0400000000001
I did watch some Netflix stuff

782.7 --> 788.279
and yeah I'm watching this Belgium

785.459 --> 791.04
detective series that I'd never heard of

788.279 --> 793.2
and it's freaking hilarious

791.04 --> 796.38
like

793.2 --> 799.8000000000001
I don't know I'm just just into it one

796.38 --> 803.459
and a half episode but I mean it's so

799.8 --> 806.2199999999999
freaking Belgium induction it's just

803.459 --> 808.9399999999999
I'm kind of enjoying it

806.22 --> 808.94
it's weird

809.94 --> 813.9200000000001
I don't know what the hell is it even

811.62 --> 813.92
called

821.62 --> 827.279
[Music]

824.279 --> 829.079
I have this

827.279 --> 832.639
w

829.079 --> 835.62
and like that's a cranky old conspiracy

832.639 --> 838.019
detective I mean it

835.62 --> 840.72
a lot of it doesn't feel like it really

838.019 --> 843.36
makes a lot of sense though but it's

840.72 --> 847.0400000000001
still very entertaining

843.36 --> 847.04
to me at least for now

852.36 --> 857.82
and I like how how horribly cranky the

855.54 --> 860.04
guy is he's like really he's like a

857.82 --> 862.9200000000001
police detective Graveler

860.04 --> 864.8389999999999
like he's like just a bad attitude

862.92 --> 867.18
continually and always freaking

864.839 --> 868.8000000000001
suspicious always conspiracy theorizing

867.18 --> 871.38
like over the top

868.8 --> 873.779
it's hilarious

871.38 --> 878.22
not in a kooky way

873.779 --> 879.959
just I don't know I like it

878.22 --> 882.24
and I'm really wondering how it's going

879.959 --> 884.399
to roll out the whole thing

882.24 --> 886.04
like this giant

884.399 --> 889.26
corporate

886.04 --> 891.5999999999999
Mysteries thing

889.26 --> 893.9399999999999
anyway

891.6 --> 897.1990000000001
anybody still here you all fell asleep

893.94 --> 897.1990000000001
or something I don't know

897.66 --> 900.5
ah

902.519 --> 905.66
let's see

907.1 --> 910.289
[Music]

912.47 --> 915.769
[Music]

918.3 --> 924.079
news wise

921.36 --> 924.0790000000001
me

925.079 --> 929.8199999999999
in the Netherlands is just a bunch of

926.82 --> 933.839
back and forth like uh criticizing oh oh

929.82 --> 936.44
criticizing the policy oh yes

933.839 --> 936.44
yes

938.339 --> 943.98
like like that's

940.86 --> 945.9590000000001
I mean yeah that's happening

943.98 --> 948.48
this is gonna stop it though is it

945.959 --> 950.88
actually gonna stop it

948.48 --> 953.0600000000001
I'm not gonna go back in spiraling like

950.88 --> 953.06
that

955.32 --> 959.88
um

956.579 --> 965.2399999999999
I had this ridiculous story that the U.S

959.88 --> 965.24
military losing an fsig an F-35

966.54 --> 972.56
like that's literally impossible that's

969.72 --> 972.5600000000001
[ __ ]

973.68 --> 976.279
foreign

978.92 --> 987.24
s are traced to all hell like

983.339 --> 990.5400000000001
if it's lost then they know exactly who

987.24 --> 993.3
to go to because like

990.54 --> 997.259
those planes have to be like signed on

993.3 --> 1000.3199999999999
to their pilot or their warehouse if

997.259 --> 1002.899
they're not in use at all times so like

1000.32 --> 1006.759
it's super traced

1002.899 --> 1006.759
and that's been like that forever

1008.72 --> 1014.1990000000001
it's interesting but yeah I mean what

1011.899 --> 1014.199
the hell

1014.899 --> 1020.6
it's just weird that they do that [ __ ]

1018.86 --> 1022.82
it just gives me this feel like they're

1020.6 --> 1026.179
gonna do some weird secret

1022.82 --> 1029.26
some Black Op with it at some point

1026.179 --> 1029.26
it's not a good thing

1030.559 --> 1035.1789999999999
but I mean it's just like that weirdo

1032.72 --> 1037.339
story of the nuke that went supposedly

1035.179 --> 1040.2800000000002
missing anybody remember that

1037.339 --> 1044.54
was from some military base

1040.28 --> 1047.1789999999999
a supposed nuke went just missing like

1044.54 --> 1050.059
is that last year or the year before I'm

1047.179 --> 1052.22
not sure somewhere there

1050.059 --> 1054.2
but I mean yeah nukes don't technically

1052.22 --> 1056.72
exist but

1054.2 --> 1059.0
that's why now in retrospect that's just

1056.72 --> 1060.6200000000001
like oh yeah well nobody cares because

1059.0 --> 1062.84
it's not real

1060.62 --> 1065.0
I mean yeah that might be like a big

1062.84 --> 1067.82
bomb or something but it's not a nuke

1065.0 --> 1070.96
like because that doesn't exist so

1067.82 --> 1070.96
nobody gives it [ __ ]

1071.059 --> 1076.8799999999999
but I mean in an actual aircraft is yeah

1074.539 --> 1079.4
those are real

1076.88 --> 1082.2800000000002
and it's quite bizarre but I mean like

1079.4 --> 1083.7800000000002
it's not like some individual can just

1082.28 --> 1085.82
steal that

1083.78 --> 1088.28
like how the hell are you gonna maintain

1085.82 --> 1092.9189999999999
and provide for that thing

1088.28 --> 1092.9189999999999
you know how much fuel those cost to use

1095.299 --> 1100.76
like and like if parts go bad how the

1098.96 --> 1103.3400000000001
[ __ ] are you gonna replace those I mean

1100.76 --> 1104.66
it's all quite illogical when you think

1103.34 --> 1107.78
about it

1104.66 --> 1110.179
the idea that's like oh it's hijacked or

1107.78 --> 1112.8799999999999
something somebody stole it that just

1110.179 --> 1116.48
makes no sense

1112.88 --> 1118.64
like it's gonna break like

1116.48 --> 1121.4
as soon as he's gonna use it at some

1118.64 --> 1123.919
point secretly it's probably gonna break

1121.4 --> 1126.38
unless there was secret like military

1123.919 --> 1128.72
level support that he could basically

1126.38 --> 1131.0590000000002
get maintenance screws in the secret

1128.72 --> 1134.0
place he kept the freaking plane at and

1131.059 --> 1136.78
maintained it that's all so stupid

1134.0 --> 1136.78
really

1144.919 --> 1149.0590000000002
oh you found homes for the kittens wow

1811.159 --> 1813.7
damn

1815.899 --> 1821.1789999999999
I mean that's an actual scary looking

1818.12 --> 1825.1999999999998
pirate I'd almost say like that's a mask

1821.179 --> 1829.48
but I know it isn't which is freaky

1825.2 --> 1829.48
damn looking interesting

1837.62 --> 1842.4189999999999
right anyway I'm gonna try to calm down

1840.14 --> 1844.72
now it might also be the storm that's

1842.419 --> 1844.72
just

1844.88 --> 1850.0590000000002
making me more loud

1855.32 --> 1859.82
it's just it would be great to have

1857.419 --> 1861.74
people on I'm like ready for more people

1859.82 --> 1865.059
on I liked it when Darth came on I'd

1861.74 --> 1865.059
love to have him again actually

1866.0 --> 1869.059
and see if I can do better than last

1868.1 --> 1871.6399999999999
time

1869.059 --> 1873.9189999999999
because I had some focusing issues and I

1871.64 --> 1877.1200000000001
feel like I wanna

1873.919 --> 1877.1200000000001
I wanna rematch

1878.539 --> 1882.62
I mean it was still pretty I still

1880.159 --> 1884.48
haven't actually listened back man I

1882.62 --> 1886.9399999999998
should really listen back to that show

1884.48 --> 1889.6
but it was so long

1886.94 --> 1889.6000000000001
God

1905.32 --> 1910.899
alrighty then Elise

1908.059 --> 1910.899
yar

1927.919 --> 1933.679
Man by the way one thing that's kind of

1931.399 --> 1936.9189999999999
interesting like at Alex Jones they're

1933.679 --> 1939.919
like playing clips now of all 2010 Alex

1936.919 --> 1941.779
Jones when he got like completely like

1939.919 --> 1944.419
ah

1941.779 --> 1947.419
and dude back then it just looked it

1944.419 --> 1950.3600000000001
just looked crazy in ways although I

1947.419 --> 1953.24
knew it was real like I I got it like I

1950.36 --> 1955.52
got the message at the time like I was I

1953.24 --> 1958.46
got that it was real

1955.52 --> 1960.799
that was [ __ ]

1958.46 --> 1963.3990000000001
but now watching it back it like that's

1960.799 --> 1963.399
amazing

1963.44 --> 1967.88
it's pretty amazing to watch that [ __ ]

1965.36 --> 1970.1589999999999
and it also it's kind of weird because

1967.88 --> 1972.7
it almost reminds me of like how I get

1970.159 --> 1972.7
pissed off

1979.58 --> 1985.76
like when I go like really

1983.059 --> 1989.0
rage win style it is kind of like how

1985.76 --> 1991.12
Alex Jones went crazy back then it

1989.0 --> 1993.5
really kind of is

1991.12 --> 1996.6999999999998
including it's just the same pattern

1993.5 --> 1996.7
it's yeah

1997.64 --> 2003.94
it's like what Alex Jones has in that

2000.519 --> 2006.82
sense in that part that modus that mode

2003.94 --> 2010.659
to basically do so do that

2006.82 --> 2014.82
I have that's the same system that that

2010.659 --> 2014.8200000000002
it has with me it always has

2019.299 --> 2023.98
it's like this

2020.799 --> 2028.179
at least two tier systems but like from

2023.98 --> 2030.7
the normal to that is like a huge jump

2028.179 --> 2032.0800000000002
from like very little aggression like

2030.7 --> 2034.96
almost nothing

2032.08 --> 2039.039
let's say like five to ten percent max

2034.96 --> 2041.32
under any circumstance to like freaking

2039.039 --> 2044.26
90.

2041.32 --> 2048.22
all of a sudden it's a big switch around

2044.26 --> 2050.379
it only works one way or the other

2048.22 --> 2052.54
you can't do it in between it doesn't

2050.379 --> 2056.399
work well if I do that I get super

2052.54 --> 2056.399
demoralized it's weird

2060.22 --> 2065.2599999999998
what's the significance of the name

2062.26 --> 2068.26
tenth man it's just typical

2065.26 --> 2068.26
uh

2069.04 --> 2077.099
it's I think it's based on some writers

2071.859 --> 2077.0989999999997
or some some philosophers saying

2077.339 --> 2083.2
like the tenth man always has to like do

2080.2 --> 2086.7
something has to do it differently it's

2083.2 --> 2089.6789999999996
symbolizing for a person that's like

2086.7 --> 2092.2
oppositionally defiant it's like no he's

2089.679 --> 2095.5
gonna do it differently everybody's just

2092.2 --> 2097.7799999999997
doing it exactly as instructed and then

2095.5 --> 2101.02
the tenth man just nope

2097.78 --> 2103.8590000000004
I'm doing a different that's what it's

2101.02 --> 2103.859
referencing

2110.8 --> 2117.7000000000003
you'll have to ask tenth man himself or

2114.339 --> 2120.88
or maybe Nathan knows it too

2117.7 --> 2123.22
what's the talk today uh

2120.88 --> 2124.78
hello turret I don't know there's not

2123.22 --> 2126.64
much of a talk today I got kind of

2124.78 --> 2129.579
pissed off at the morgow for not making

2126.64 --> 2131.68
basic contact after basically vouching

2129.579 --> 2133.9
to come on my show

2131.68 --> 2135.52
and I'm pissed off at it because it's

2133.9 --> 2138.1800000000003
been a week and I'm like what the [ __ ]

2135.52 --> 2138.18
is this [ __ ]

2138.7 --> 2144.46
am I a joke to you or something

2141.22 --> 2146.6189999999997
you just forget

2144.46 --> 2149.82
wow

2146.619 --> 2149.82
so I got pissed off

2152.16 --> 2160.0789999999997
because I definitely don't like to be

2155.859 --> 2160.0789999999997
traded like some third class citizen

2177.119 --> 2185.56
Neil Adam Martin on my show Stevie

2181.8 --> 2190.5
really you won't kneel on my Jesus

2185.56 --> 2190.5
that that's gonna be weird though

2195.4 --> 2201.28
I don't know

2196.9 --> 2204.82
Adam well I don't know

2201.28 --> 2207.46
it's really hard to get Adam on

2204.82 --> 2209.1400000000003
I mean dude if it were up to me I'd have

2207.46 --> 2212.26
Adam on like

2209.14 --> 2214.66
two or three times a week because he's

2212.26 --> 2217.78
[ __ ] genius and he knows so much

2214.66 --> 2219.16
about things that I really like to

2217.78 --> 2221.02
address

2219.16 --> 2224.5789999999997
so he could be like this perfect

2221.02 --> 2224.579
supplementation but I mean

2225.099 --> 2228.6600000000003
I don't think he wants to do it

2231.22 --> 2236.339
otherwise he would have probably offered

2233.619 --> 2236.339
it a lot more

2238.78 --> 2241.6800000000003
I don't know

2242.68 --> 2247.1189999999997
you'd have to show up and I'll ask I'll

2245.68 --> 2248.9199999999996
just ask him hey want to come on

2247.119 --> 2252.96
sometime

2248.92 --> 2252.96
I want to try to get more people on

2254.2 --> 2259.72
like I think I could do better

2256.78 --> 2261.3390000000004
there's like in the beginnings like say

2259.72 --> 2263.56
early bird

2261.339 --> 2266.68
up to a thousand

2263.56 --> 2269.68
or up to 500 like I would have more

2266.68 --> 2271.359
people on but I really didn't I didn't

2269.68 --> 2274.839
really know what to do I didn't really

2271.359 --> 2278.2
know what position I had properly

2274.839 --> 2281.859
how to have a composure towards them

2278.2 --> 2283.54
I know all these things a lot better now

2281.859 --> 2285.16
and like

2283.54 --> 2287.98
the uh

2285.16 --> 2290.6189999999997
the show where I had uh what's his name

2287.98 --> 2292.2400000000002
again on not Darth that was the last

2290.619 --> 2294.28
time it went great

2292.24 --> 2296.56
except for me losing focus a couple of

2294.28 --> 2299.38
times but the guy before that the Dutch

2296.56 --> 2301.599
guy what the hell is his name again

2299.38 --> 2303.94
I haven't seen him for a while

2301.599 --> 2306.3590000000004
but anyway he came on and that was

2303.94 --> 2306.359
pretty cool

2307.9 --> 2311.339
anybody remember the name

2312.28 --> 2315.96
he should still be

2319.42 --> 2325.3
in my Ranch list let me check out I can

2322.96 --> 2326.44
just scroll through it I'll recognize

2325.3 --> 2329.46
him

2326.44 --> 2329.46
when I see it

2340.72 --> 2344.7599999999998
look

2341.98 --> 2344.76
okay

2349.72 --> 2352.56
or is it

2356.079 --> 2362.76
we didn't just change his name

2359.2 --> 2362.7599999999998
would be very annoying

2365.2 --> 2371.7
has anybody seen PJ CNET

2368.32 --> 2371.7000000000003
I've seen him in a long time

2377.079 --> 2381.6600000000003
okay Mike's in the niche

2384.339 --> 2387.359
where is he

2403.0 --> 2409.38
what the heck

2405.94 --> 2409.38
why isn't he in there

2414.82 --> 2417.839
where did he go

2417.88 --> 2422.92
I hope he he's not the guy that had just

2420.52 --> 2424.9
kicked out when he turned out to have a

2422.92 --> 2426.76
wrench in a completely unfamiliar name

2424.9 --> 2430.42
which is like the worst thing you could

2426.76 --> 2432.96
ever do by the way never do that

2430.42 --> 2435.88
don't just suddenly

2432.96 --> 2438.9
change your name

2435.88 --> 2438.9
and show up

2442.42 --> 2445.839
I think it might have been him I think I

2444.46 --> 2447.88
might have accidentally kicked him out

2445.839 --> 2450.7
but this is weird though because we have

2447.88 --> 2453.9
contact on Skype he could have just said

2450.7 --> 2453.8999999999996
hello on Skype

2454.54 --> 2457.92
where the hell is he

2458.619 --> 2463.38
I don't even remember his name now this

2460.9 --> 2463.38
is stupid

2473.8 --> 2476.8
nope

2487.24 --> 2492.72
see Moon flat sides often PJ seen it

2490.119 --> 2492.7200000000003
okay

2494.32 --> 2498.88
maybe he's just kind of done with me I

2497.079 --> 2501.82
don't know what it is Moretz that's

2498.88 --> 2505.44
right hey thank you logical observations

2501.82 --> 2505.44
yeah where the [ __ ] is he

2505.78 --> 2511.3
he's not in the list

2508.54 --> 2513.48
he should be I did give him a wrench

2511.3 --> 2513.48
right

2514.119 --> 2520.7200000000003
where is he maybe it's the maybe his

2516.94 --> 2522.64
YouTube was deleted I hope not

2520.72 --> 2526.7999999999997
because when the YouTube gets deleted

2522.64 --> 2526.7999999999997
that does also remove it

2527.859 --> 2529.859
um

2534.339 --> 2538.9
I don't know why low fruit is a managing

2536.74 --> 2541.4399999999996
moderator by the way what the [ __ ] did I

2538.9 --> 2541.44
just do that

2543.22 --> 2546.4199999999996
is low fruit here

2563.26 --> 2568.26
right let's see if I can find status

2565.599 --> 2568.26
Moretz

2590.98 --> 2593.98
nope

2597.4 --> 2604.5
his account seems to be non-existent

2601.66 --> 2604.5
so weird

2605.319 --> 2608.64
did he just delete it

2613.78 --> 2620.76
holy [ __ ] there's a ton load of gamma

2616.359 --> 2620.7599999999998
videos on YouTube Jesus

2621.359 --> 2625.0789999999997
endless soy face

2625.119 --> 2632.98
rocking hell

2628.119 --> 2635.319
nope I guess this YouTube is gone

2632.98 --> 2638.319
well that would explain why you couldn't

2635.319 --> 2641.339
find him in the list

2638.319 --> 2641.339
it's real shame

2653.07 --> 2656.7490000000003
[Music]

2663.16 --> 2666.839
what are you guys talking about

2675.819 --> 2681.04
sick leader what the division of a

2678.76 --> 2683.5200000000004
community even in India everyone took

2681.04 --> 2683.52
care of what

2686.819 --> 2693.16
Trudeau is explained in government kill

2690.339 --> 2696.9
toxicity uh

2693.16 --> 2696.8999999999996
okay sounds complicated

2697.78 --> 2704.88
hey can a bear good to see you

2701.38 --> 2704.88
and hello seeking star water

2707.68 --> 2713.68
if I missed anybody else that had popped

2710.2 --> 2714.9399999999996
up in chat sorry I got distracted

2713.68 --> 2718.359
searching

2714.94 --> 2721.06
oh Nathan is life

2718.359 --> 2724.38
oh okay

2721.06 --> 2724.38
not premiere

2728.02 --> 2732.119
oh yeah I guess okay

2734.099 --> 2738.339
I guess today is going to be a very

2736.42 --> 2741.0
short show because Nathan is gonna go

2738.339 --> 2741.0
live tomorrow

2741.52 --> 2744.52
foreign

2745.18 --> 2755.8289999999997
[Music]

2762.339 --> 2767.7
right so yeah

2764.92 --> 2767.7000000000003
just

2768.819 --> 2773.2
yeah we got half an hour whatever you

2771.22 --> 2776.56
guys want to talk about when something

2773.2 --> 2779.859
spiritual mechanical complex political

2776.56 --> 2784.02
whatever man give me give me something

2779.859 --> 2784.02
that's not really vague

2784.66 --> 2792.339
like who killed some leader in a country

2788.92 --> 2796.119
and then bickering with leaders of other

2792.339 --> 2799.359
countries because that's just like what

2796.119 --> 2802.56
I mean it interesting and all but like I

2799.359 --> 2802.56
don't know anything about that

2812.02 --> 2816.06
I want to discuss Owen Benjamin

2816.339 --> 2822.52
because he's now like fully going after

2818.98 --> 2825.3
this pockets of the future

2822.52 --> 2825.3
guy

2827.859 --> 2833.38
I mean look at he has now a whole list

2831.099 --> 2835.96
of people that he's just like all these

2833.38 --> 2838.2400000000002
people he supposedly was a fan of and

2835.96 --> 2839.68
then they all turned into [ __ ]

2838.24 --> 2842.5
but I mean

2839.68 --> 2844.24
very early on

2842.5 --> 2845.98
when I like first discovered Owen

2844.24 --> 2847.4799999999996
Benjamin he was like oh yeah this guy

2845.98 --> 2849.64
that and I'm like

2847.48 --> 2851.14
I checked it out and I'm like this is

2849.64 --> 2854.14
[ __ ] crap

2851.14 --> 2856.98
what the hell why the hell would you

2854.14 --> 2856.98
watch this [ __ ]

2858.4 --> 2864.76
like with with all of these guys except

2862.359 --> 2867.22
for Jim Bob because with Jim Bob it was

2864.76 --> 2869.2000000000003
like yeah I have been on the show with

2867.22 --> 2871.9199999999996
Jim Bobby because he used to be actually

2869.2 --> 2871.9199999999996
interesting

2872.02 --> 2878.579
until he went over

2874.68 --> 2878.5789999999997
squirtedox basically

2884.44 --> 2888.66
and then it just became really boring

2890.079 --> 2892.26
foreign

2905.04 --> 2909.579
I have no idea what you're talking about

2907.359 --> 2912.819
get a bear

2909.579 --> 2914.25
I am not informed about the freaking rap

2912.819 --> 2917.2889999999998
scene bro

2914.25 --> 2917.289
[Music]

2917.46 --> 2924.359
except for chocolate Saiyans rap I'm

2920.92 --> 2924.359
always informed about those

2930.7 --> 2935.14
who want to come a very long way

2932.92 --> 2936.099
well he still has a long way to go I

2935.14 --> 2938.02
mean

2936.099 --> 2942.0
bro most

2938.02 --> 2942.0
I mean David Weiss dude

2947.2 --> 2952.0789999999997
it's gonna be that's gonna happen at

2949.78 --> 2952.079
some point

2954.579 --> 2959.38
or maybe he's just gonna keep it at a

2956.98 --> 2961.18
bit because like he's been promoting

2959.38 --> 2963.76
like David Wise for a while but David

2961.18 --> 2965.319
Weiss talks a lot of complete horror

2963.76 --> 2968.0200000000004
[ __ ]

2965.319 --> 2970.18
like he gets it's so wrong

2968.02 --> 2972.28
and he keeps getting it wrong and it's

2970.18 --> 2976.2
like it's very embarrassing

2972.28 --> 2976.2000000000003
and it's literally confusing

2976.359 --> 2981.339
and Owen should absolutely recognize

2979.119 --> 2984.4
that and if he doesn't then that is

2981.339 --> 2987.099
that's really like a sign on the wall to

2984.4 --> 2989.2000000000003
me that he's not very competent

2987.099 --> 2991.599
with these sort of things despite his

2989.2 --> 2994.66
claiming that he's so great at physics

2991.599 --> 2997.54
which is like no no you're not

2994.66 --> 2999.16
I'm sure I'm sure like especially Amy's

2997.54 --> 3000.96
really good at engineering right

2999.16 --> 3002.5789999999997
measuring and

3000.96 --> 3005.76
patterns and all that and you're

3002.579 --> 3008.819
recognizing is great

3005.76 --> 3011.76
but if you think that that that those

3008.819 --> 3014.099
are good sources for physics then you're

3011.76 --> 3016.1400000000003
not good at physics

3014.099 --> 3017.7000000000003
I'm sorry

3016.14 --> 3019.859
you're not

3017.7 --> 3023.2999999999997
doesn't mean that everybody else is

3019.859 --> 3026.819
better at it than you are

3023.3 --> 3029.819
because out there it's even worse people

3026.819 --> 3031.859
like can't even go beyond their basic

3029.819 --> 3033.66
programming like they didn't even like

3031.859 --> 3036.48
take the effort to think about how

3033.66 --> 3038.2799999999997
things work beyond [ __ ] school with

3036.48 --> 3040.2
these things yeah that's the real

3038.28 --> 3042.78
problem

3040.2 --> 3045.48
but that doesn't mean that you're very

3042.78 --> 3048.3
good at it you're not very good at it I

3045.48 --> 3051.98
literally am saying that Owen Benjamin

3048.3 --> 3051.98
is not very good at physics

3053.04 --> 3059.819
his explanations are for the quality

3056.819 --> 3062.7
level of his average of explanations of

3059.819 --> 3065.7
things yeah like for example he's really

3062.7 --> 3068.819
good and actually really good at like

3065.7 --> 3072.0
social situation explanations or like in

3068.819 --> 3074.22
relationships how it is how things have

3072.0 --> 3076.319
that one of the best explainers I've

3074.22 --> 3079.859
ever heard okay and I've heard quite

3076.319 --> 3082.92
some is really impressive yeah when he

3079.859 --> 3085.14
starts to talk physics it's not even

3082.92 --> 3088.26
close to that level

3085.14 --> 3089.66
it's very clumsy

3088.26 --> 3092.1600000000003
it's

3089.66 --> 3094.6189999999997
unnecessarily basic

3092.16 --> 3097.02
and well and clumsy and it's just like

3094.619 --> 3100.02
it no this is not good

3097.02 --> 3103.44
you're you don't seem to have like a

3100.02 --> 3105.54
real durable complete picture

3103.44 --> 3108.359
we have a couple of things it kind of

3105.54 --> 3110.04
fits and that's what I'm hearing every

3108.359 --> 3112.14
time

3110.04 --> 3113.579
you're not proving that you're a master

3112.14 --> 3116.64
at all

3113.579 --> 3119.579
like I am I am an absolute Master when

3116.64 --> 3121.859
it comes to physics explanations like of

3119.579 --> 3124.559
how relative density works right I

3121.859 --> 3126.2999999999997
bypass the math [ __ ] the math I do

3124.559 --> 3130.46
everything descriptive and that work

3126.3 --> 3130.46
that actually makes you understand it

3132.3 --> 3137.3390000000004
math is just a [ __ ] distraction it's

3134.7 --> 3140.839
another way of thinking that does not

3137.339 --> 3140.839
really help with oversight

3141.8 --> 3147.5
the math is more about ironing out the

3145.02 --> 3151.44
details it's like sharpening the edges

3147.5 --> 3154.4
polishing the surfaces it's not about

3151.44 --> 3154.4
the whole shape

3154.559 --> 3159.2400000000002
you gotta know how it works before you

3156.9 --> 3161.579
get the D before you even consider

3159.24 --> 3165.0
caring about the details

3161.579 --> 3167.1600000000003
right that's what's important

3165.0 --> 3170.52
anyway

3167.16 --> 3172.6189999999997
so yeah it's not the end I mean he has a

3170.52 --> 3174.72
whole range of people that all like have

3172.619 --> 3176.88
turned on him and [ __ ] and I was like

3174.72 --> 3180.0
why the hell would you even

3176.88 --> 3182.52
be fans of those people anyway like why

3180.0 --> 3185.16
I don't understand Owen I really don't

3182.52 --> 3187.46
understand why he would be interested in

3185.16 --> 3187.46
that

3187.619 --> 3190.46
foreign

3198.26 --> 3204.42
no but you did Richard G it's when it it

3201.96 --> 3207.599
doesn't really do full physics Class

3204.42 --> 3209.76
Type explanations but when he starts

3207.599 --> 3211.619
talking about Flat Earth he does like

3209.76 --> 3215.2200000000003
pull in

3211.619 --> 3217.38
sort of physics based talk

3215.22 --> 3219.9199999999996
but it's very primitive and it's super

3217.38 --> 3219.92
messy

3227.4 --> 3235.5
he doesn't have that true

3231.78 --> 3236.8190000000004
from The Roots complete oversight type

3235.5 --> 3239.819
thing

3236.819 --> 3242.339
about everything he doesn't have he he

3239.819 --> 3245.7
doesn't have that dynamic

3242.339 --> 3249.119
not not to that level

3245.7 --> 3251.839
not in that sector he does seem to very

3249.119 --> 3254.46
much have it in social interaction

3251.839 --> 3256.64
systems that's where he has this like

3254.46 --> 3259.859
magnificent

3256.64 --> 3262.2
Insight memory

3259.859 --> 3264.119
like I can see when he talks about it

3262.2 --> 3267.1189999999997
that he has like all these memories of

3264.119 --> 3270.119
all these events just sitting beside him

3267.119 --> 3273.1800000000003
as a source like you can feel that you

3270.119 --> 3276.3
can hear that about he is good at that

3273.18 --> 3279.18
he really is when he talks physics it's

3276.3 --> 3281.099
like this [ __ ] mess every time it's

3279.18 --> 3282.14
like a mess he's like oh no I could do

3281.099 --> 3285.96
it like

3282.14 --> 3287.5789999999997
oh yeah it sort of works like no no

3285.96 --> 3291.26
that's not good

3287.579 --> 3291.26
it's a mess

3291.96 --> 3295.7400000000002
can't just Bluff that you're great at it

3293.94 --> 3298.2000000000003
doesn't work you're not great at it

3295.74 --> 3301.74
you're great at Social things you're not

3298.2 --> 3304.319
great at physics Owen

3301.74 --> 3306.66
I mean if you'd prepare I'm sure you're

3304.319 --> 3310.88
gonna absolutely Master it

3306.66 --> 3310.8799999999997
but not on the Run you're not

3316.619 --> 3322.5
you don't have that perfect Insight in

3319.5 --> 3325.74
the moment spontaneously I have that

3322.5 --> 3327.54
thing I have that is one of my unique

3325.74 --> 3329.9399999999996
things that I do

3327.54 --> 3332.16
he doesn't have that

3329.94 --> 3336.44
he has it with social interaction he's

3332.16 --> 3336.44
basically more of a psychologist type

3336.599 --> 3342.26
than a physicist type

3339.3 --> 3342.26
I am both

3345.119 --> 3351.119
but my psychologist type

3348.24 --> 3353.7
it's like Owen is always going to be

3351.119 --> 3357.48
better basically in a way in a certain

3353.7 --> 3359.7
way in Psychology than I am

3357.48 --> 3362.819
even though I'm probably better at

3359.7 --> 3365.7599999999998
explaining things

3362.819 --> 3368.46
about it carefully

3365.76 --> 3370.559
but he's much better at actually using

3368.46 --> 3373.02
it and being funny with it

3370.559 --> 3375.42
estimating like the grounds how

3373.02 --> 3378.859
everybody's feeling like he's better

3375.42 --> 3378.859
with it than I am

3390.42 --> 3397.98
does Owen still do stand-up comedy at

3393.599 --> 3401.4
clubs no he doesn't go to clubs

3397.98 --> 3405.119
he goes to festivals and he goes to like

3401.4 --> 3409.92
sometimes he just organizes his own tour

3405.119 --> 3414.48
but he's been he's uh basically had

3409.92 --> 3416.819
the barteria festival what is it

3414.48 --> 3418.92
was that in Missouri

3416.819 --> 3421.38
it's a huge event

3418.92 --> 3424.559
he's done that recently steamy traveler

3421.38 --> 3427.7400000000002
I mean yeah he's still busy

3424.559 --> 3429.7200000000003
but he doesn't like go around comedy

3427.74 --> 3431.9399999999996
clubs that's like it just doesn't have

3429.72 --> 3433.7999999999997
time for that crap

3431.94 --> 3436.619
and most of them wouldn't invite him

3433.8 --> 3438.92
anyway because he's not PC and all that

3436.619 --> 3438.92
crap

3445.28 --> 3448.94
they're all ruined

3451.5 --> 3456.859
they only invite soy face comedians

3465.119 --> 3469.46
and hello by the way borders boy good to

3467.22 --> 3469.4599999999996
see you

3492.119 --> 3496.76
hmm let's call this is

3499.579 --> 3505.3390000000004
a Celine ex Eclipse that's

3505.7 --> 3510.319
funny kind of bear thank you for that

3528.059 --> 3538.6400000000003
it's a it's this Sena lineian

3532.26 --> 3538.6400000000003
the semolina Eclipse okay how about that

3540.24 --> 3542.7799999999997
thank you

3544.86 --> 3547.969
[Music]

3554.18 --> 3558.74
selenalian

3555.96 --> 3558.7400000000002
yeah

3558.8 --> 3561.9390000000003
[Music]

3564.48 --> 3569.64
all right

3566.49 --> 3573.18
[Music]

3569.64 --> 3575.5789999999997
right I could talk about that I've

3573.18 --> 3580.16
discovered that the the brother of

3575.579 --> 3580.1600000000003
grifters is actually really vast

3581.18 --> 3586.2
and I think the brother of grifters is

3583.98 --> 3589.099
basically gonna

3586.2 --> 3589.0989999999997
try to replace

3589.319 --> 3595.68
the liberal Imperium

3592.74 --> 3600.6189999999997
but it's gonna be very like the liberal

3595.68 --> 3600.6189999999997
Imperium except with other parameters

3602.099 --> 3606.9
right and there's always the issue with

3604.38 --> 3609.78
brother of grifters is that they don't

3606.9 --> 3612.9
actually change things too much it's

3609.78 --> 3615.48
like no they actually want to be at the

3612.9 --> 3619.319
head of the wheel it's like we can do

3615.48 --> 3621.78
your form of tyranny much better

3619.319 --> 3623.819
with less angry people that's literally

3621.78 --> 3625.619
like how they think about it a lot of

3623.819 --> 3627.48
the time

3625.619 --> 3630.96
it's like oh once this border is crossed

3627.48 --> 3633.9
no no you don't undo that you just

3630.96 --> 3636.48
save it for the right moment and then

3633.9 --> 3639.7200000000003
you use that power right

3636.48 --> 3642.359
it's the brother of grifter's motto

3639.72 --> 3644.22
don't actually change it just take it

3642.359 --> 3648.5
over

3644.22 --> 3648.5
and you're gonna do better sure you are

3648.66 --> 3652.74
right and then they get replaced by

3650.94 --> 3654.42
another liberal Imperium and then they

3652.74 --> 3657.72
just keep going and then they haven't

3654.42 --> 3659.52
had any regression they just gotta keep

3657.72 --> 3661.0789999999997
going so it's like this win-win

3659.52 --> 3663.059
situation between the Brotherhood of

3661.079 --> 3665.099
grifters and the

3663.059 --> 3668.599
Libra Imperium because the Brotherhood

3665.099 --> 3670.92
of grifter is very rarely like

3668.599 --> 3673.1400000000003
builds down

3670.92 --> 3675.42
what the liberal Imperium has actually

3673.14 --> 3678.1189999999997
built for themselves

3675.42 --> 3679.38
but of grifters just likes to replace

3678.119 --> 3681.599
them

3679.38 --> 3682.7400000000002
use whatever the liberal Imperium has

3681.599 --> 3684.2400000000002
built

3682.74 --> 3686.9399999999996
to like

3684.24 --> 3690.18
do it the opposite way

3686.94 --> 3692.46
but not build all of it down not

3690.18 --> 3696.0
actually replacing the whole thing so

3692.46 --> 3698.9
that that entire abuse structure

3696.0 --> 3698.9
is gone

3715.079 --> 3718.4
right but anyway

3718.76 --> 3723.1800000000003
I really like it like I'm gonna

3721.079 --> 3724.8590000000004
reference that a lot more the liberal

3723.18 --> 3727.0789999999997
Imperium versus

3724.859 --> 3729.54
Brotherhood of grifters it's it's really

3727.079 --> 3732.42
serious

3729.54 --> 3735.0589999999997
I'm very proud of

3732.42 --> 3737.64
like it's almost good enough to like

3735.059 --> 3741.2000000000003
write a book around it

3737.64 --> 3741.2
just those two words

3743.16 --> 3746.24
those two titles

3747.72 --> 3751.68
what I'm gonna keep it in and it's

3749.7 --> 3753.98
always going to be tied in with Chivas

3751.68 --> 3753.98
Lord

3755.48 --> 3760.319
oh by the way did anybody see that

3757.92 --> 3762.9
yesterday that was something that's

3760.319 --> 3764.339
worth noteworthy it was weird like Shiva

3762.9 --> 3765.9
sometimes has some pretty weird people

3764.339 --> 3768.9
on

3765.9 --> 3772.5
yes they hit like this woman

3768.9 --> 3776.339
that seemed like

3772.5 --> 3780.9
kind of like the benefit Jewish women

3776.339 --> 3783.9
type kind of very forward very

3780.9 --> 3785.88
like aggressive but not in like a

3783.9 --> 3789.1800000000003
hostile way necessarily but like

3785.88 --> 3791.52
aggressive personality what's this weird

3789.18 --> 3793.2799999999997
hypnotic background and like

3791.52 --> 3798.2
that was weird

3793.28 --> 3798.2000000000003
but interesting Chivas very dynamic

3801.0 --> 3804.14
anybody seen that

3807.839 --> 3812.0589999999997
let's see if I can find the link for

3809.819 --> 3812.0589999999997
that

3816.059 --> 3818.78
this one

3829.22 --> 3834.9599999999996
anybody see that

3831.839 --> 3837.299
I mean it's not like whoa revolutionary

3834.96 --> 3839.579
but it is like an interesting thing to

3837.299 --> 3843.48
see like how they back and forth because

3839.579 --> 3847.26
that woman is kind of a pain in the ass

3843.48 --> 3849.2400000000002
what Jewish woman type how dare you hey

3847.26 --> 3854.099
bro

3849.24 --> 3856.859
I mean call me sickly but I I kind of am

3854.099 --> 3859.02
sorry to slightly attracted to that

3856.859 --> 3860.66
I mean I'm not really gonna go for that

3859.02 --> 3864.66
but I am

3860.66 --> 3866.0989999999997
so I don't mean it like oh I hate that

3864.66 --> 3868.3799999999997
no it's just like

3866.099 --> 3871.319
it's just kind of a dewy type I mean

3868.38 --> 3875.1600000000003
like come on it is there's a lot of

3871.319 --> 3878.4
those they're very popular there right

3875.16 --> 3881.2799999999997
or at least they think they are

3878.4 --> 3885.079
I don't know anymore

3881.28 --> 3885.079
I didn't mean to be mean

3888.18 --> 3894.96
yeah classical homeopaths

3891.78 --> 3898.38
but I mean just look just click the link

3894.96 --> 3900.619
and look at the face I mean come on come

3898.38 --> 3900.619
on

3901.559 --> 3906.38
I mean she's not even like that ugly or

3904.2 --> 3906.3799999999997
anything

3907.5 --> 3912.319
Crypt I'm a crypto Jew [ __ ] that

3914.88 --> 3918.619
why you yeah what that is

3918.78 --> 3922.2200000000003
I mean I'm eclectic

3922.5 --> 3928.859
I I do like sort of

3925.68 --> 3931.2
I'm like mostly on the side of the the

3928.859 --> 3933.96
Jewish lore stuff

3931.2 --> 3937.46
like the from with Christ right that

3933.96 --> 3937.46
comes from that lore

3938.28 --> 3944.3390000000004
but I don't really as assign myself to

3941.579 --> 3947.7000000000003
like oh I have to follow these rules or

3944.339 --> 3951.9
Traditions like that it's like no

3947.7 --> 3955.14
I am according to Eric Dubey oh

3951.9 --> 3957.78
yeah that that is fair enough he did say

3955.14 --> 3961.2599999999998
that like years ago

3957.78 --> 3963.299
it is interesting and I mean but people

3961.26 --> 3965.2200000000003
might think that I'm a Jew because I'm

3963.299 --> 3967.14
like wearing this ring right and I wear

3965.22 --> 3969.48
it proudly but that's just because

3967.14 --> 3972.0589999999997
they're not looking carefully

3969.48 --> 3974.52
right am I right they're just not

3972.059 --> 3977.48
looking carefully

3974.52 --> 3977.48
am I right

3978.66 --> 3984.359
because you might think oh that's that's

3981.54 --> 3986.7
a jewelry no no it isn't

3984.359 --> 3989.119
you just have to like actually look

3986.7 --> 3989.1189999999997
carefully

3993.059 --> 3996.8390000000004
but I don't know do am I very typically

3995.579 --> 3998.88
Jewish

3996.839 --> 4002.119
I mean I do have like that super

3998.88 --> 4003.92
aggressive nationality thing sort of in

4002.119 --> 4006.1400000000003
me

4003.92 --> 4008.42
cool ring did I make that yeah it's the

4006.14 --> 4011.68
first gold ring I it's the first gold

4008.42 --> 4011.6800000000003
object I've ever made

4013.099 --> 4015.6400000000003
okay

4016.48 --> 4020.96
nah not you

4018.559 --> 4024.46
why not oh yeah because I'm really

4020.96 --> 4029.619
terrible at finances right

4024.46 --> 4029.619
is that like the defining Factor

4035.18 --> 4040.0389999999998
because I don't know my subconscious may

4037.28 --> 4042.799
have actually made me terrible at

4040.039 --> 4045.579
finances just so I wouldn't be called a

4042.799 --> 4045.579
Jew all the time

4049.24 --> 4052.4799999999996
I don't know

4053.599 --> 4058.099
also like being part of that would mean

4055.819 --> 4061.16
I'd have to actually deal with that sort

4058.099 --> 4064.579
of behavior up close like with family

4061.16 --> 4067.18
and stuff and I don't know if I'd fare

4064.579 --> 4067.1800000000003
very well

4069.079 --> 4073.2200000000003
guess you're not a Jew either it's okay

4071.78 --> 4076.119
kind of bear

4073.22 --> 4076.1189999999997
what I mean

4077.66 --> 4084.799
it's weird I do have like some sympathy

4083.299 --> 4086.66
for Jews

4084.799 --> 4089.72
just not when they're playing their

4086.66 --> 4092.72
victim Trixie when they're playing that

4089.72 --> 4095.839
book I don't like that

4092.72 --> 4098.299
but like when they're just like

4095.839 --> 4100.04
in a neutral place and they're just like

4098.299 --> 4102.08
being there doing their thing and

4100.04 --> 4103.94
thinking their thing and they're not

4102.08 --> 4105.44
always obsessed with negative [ __ ] so

4103.94 --> 4107.54
you have some of those those are just

4105.44 --> 4108.98
[ __ ] annoying but not all Jews are

4107.54 --> 4111.5
like that okay

4108.98 --> 4114.0199999999995
it's just like they're actually really

4111.5 --> 4116.02
interesting

4114.02 --> 4116.02
um

4118.699 --> 4123.5
dare I say it had plenty of Jewish

4121.819 --> 4125.779
friends

4123.5 --> 4129.04
sort of

4125.779 --> 4129.040000000001
in school and stuff

4130.94 --> 4137.12
and I'd like stick up for them too

4134.179 --> 4139.04
some of them were like really tiny and

4137.12 --> 4141.14
I'd be like I need to defend this guy

4139.04 --> 4142.699
this guy's really awesome he's actually

4141.14 --> 4144.14
a really good guy

4142.699 --> 4146.3589999999995
like very

4144.14 --> 4148.52
Christian in ways but he is a Jew but

4146.359 --> 4151.58
he's like

4148.52 --> 4153.56
yeah and I'm like yeah I want to defend

4151.58 --> 4155.0599999999995
him he looks a bit fragile I need to

4153.56 --> 4157.279
protect him because he's like really

4155.06 --> 4158.06
smart and he would be very good for the

4157.279 --> 4161.259
future

4158.06 --> 4161.259
good to have him

4164.54 --> 4168.199
so I've always been like a friend of the

4166.699 --> 4171.3189999999995
Jew in that sense

4168.199 --> 4173.66
but I also definitely reserve the right

4171.319 --> 4176.779
to make fun of them

4173.66 --> 4179.299
it's that's the price

4176.779 --> 4184.040000000001
like because it would be too difficult

4179.299 --> 4186.44
to like do like deal with them and not

4184.04 --> 4188.179
think it's funny at times I just can't

4186.44 --> 4189.98
do it I'm not gonna make fun to your

4188.179 --> 4192.14
face I'm not gonna like make you feel

4189.98 --> 4194.839999999999
ashamed or something

4192.14 --> 4195.92
but I just genuinely like to make fun of

4194.84 --> 4198.5
them you know

4195.92 --> 4202.719
it's just I

4198.5 --> 4205.4
it's just I gotta do it I'm sorry

4202.719 --> 4207.82
joopsies what the [ __ ] are you saying

4205.4 --> 4207.82
Jennifer

4209.719 --> 4212.26
right

4216.92 --> 4221.0
but I mean just see it like this it's

4219.08 --> 4223.88
not like oh I'm picking on the two I'm

4221.0 --> 4226.4
pick on Christians too I will call

4223.88 --> 4228.92
I'm actually much more angry at like

4226.4 --> 4233.5599999999995
stupid Christian Behavior

4228.92 --> 4233.56
than Jews that are very Gravely

4233.78 --> 4238.219
because Christian like when Jews there

4236.0 --> 4241.28
are very Gravely don't they know they're

4238.219 --> 4243.62
being naughty or even evil

4241.28 --> 4245.78
right so they're being on more honest

4243.62 --> 4248.42
about it while those Christian weirdos

4245.78 --> 4250.219
when they get really fanatical like they

4248.42 --> 4252.38
actually think that they're the good

4250.219 --> 4254.84
guys when they're like very obviously

4252.38 --> 4259.3
not they're kind of crazy

4254.84 --> 4259.3
that really pisses me off a lot more

4267.32 --> 4272.08
roll over roll over Christians right

4273.32 --> 4277.88
so it's not just oh I gotta make fun of

4275.9 --> 4279.259999999999
the Jews because they're the Target no

4277.88 --> 4282.8
they're not

4279.26 --> 4284.54
it's just they have issues that I just

4282.8 --> 4286.58
like to make fun of and I think that

4284.54 --> 4288.44
making fun of it would actually be good

4286.58 --> 4290.92
for them

4288.44 --> 4290.919999999999
right

4294.98 --> 4301.159
it's yeah because

4298.699 --> 4304.759999999999
yeah it just is it

4301.159 --> 4308.86
just don't be so freaking tense

4304.76 --> 4308.860000000001
like dare to be seen

4313.58 --> 4319.76
it's a song what

4316.82 --> 4322.78
role of our questions okay

4319.76 --> 4322.780000000001
oh what is that

4324.02 --> 4327.56
a new song

4325.22 --> 4329.360000000001
[Music]

4327.56 --> 4333.679
oh three years ago

4329.36 --> 4333.679

4347.06 --> 4350.780000000001
you got your own following don't you

4349.1 --> 4352.9400000000005
there's people in there that I don't

4350.78 --> 4356.8
recognize

4352.94 --> 4356.799999999999
at least she cool

4374.84 --> 4379.46
right but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to

4376.64 --> 4381.1990000000005
round out the show

4379.46 --> 4383.42
ah

4381.199 --> 4385.719
it's but it just started to get fun

4383.42 --> 4385.719
though

4388.46 --> 4393.8
maybe not so fun for the morgow earlier

4391.46 --> 4395.96
but I mean yeah dude

4393.8 --> 4399.9800000000005
I got email

4395.96 --> 4403.28
I got Skype it's all available

4399.98 --> 4406.159
I had I don't have direct contact with

4403.28 --> 4408.98
you so I asked somebody that had Direct

4406.159 --> 4411.679
contact with you to like hey could you

4408.98 --> 4415.218999999999
ask me him if he wants to come on then

4411.679 --> 4417.38
that person says yes he said yes

4415.219 --> 4418.58
and then I asked okay tell him to

4417.38 --> 4420.679
contact me

4418.58 --> 4423.62
and now it's a week later and he hasn't

4420.679 --> 4425.78
done anything he did come on fed in

4423.62 --> 4427.46
between though yeah that feels like I'm

4425.78 --> 4431.739
getting ignored feel like I'm not being

4427.46 --> 4431.7390000000005
respected so I I'm pissed off

4434.06 --> 4442.1
yeah and I am pissed off and I can tell

4437.719 --> 4446.14
you that exactly this Behavior yeah

4442.1 --> 4449.96
like not showing up not saying anything

4446.14 --> 4452.780000000001
is literally like the thing that made me

4449.96 --> 4456.26
permanently break off a friendship

4452.78 --> 4458.96
with my previous friends that I had for

4456.26 --> 4462.1990000000005
like 15 years

4458.96 --> 4464.36
yeah that's how [ __ ] serious that is

4462.199 --> 4466.759999999999
to me like

4464.36 --> 4470.12
because that person is like yeah we're

4466.76 --> 4471.9800000000005
gonna do this on this day this time okay

4470.12 --> 4473.48
and then they just don't show up and

4471.98 --> 4476.599999999999
then they don't say anything and they

4473.48 --> 4478.639999999999
don't say anything for days

4476.6 --> 4481.88
