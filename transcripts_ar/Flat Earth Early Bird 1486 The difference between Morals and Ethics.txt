we'll see what's gonna happen today

170.22 --> 175.68
yeah no fpd yesterday Nathan supposedly

173.4 --> 177.9
got his computer back but then he spent

175.68 --> 181.20000000000002
pretty much the entire day testing it so

177.9 --> 183.36
but I expect there should be a video

181.2 --> 186.14
live today

183.36 --> 186.14000000000001
we'll see

187.019 --> 192.08
all right

188.519 --> 192.08
but it's been a very quiet week

194.28 --> 198.019
on that front right

198.78 --> 204.44
hey flutter Sage it's been a while good

202.019 --> 204.44

204.9 --> 207.5
foreign

212.78 --> 216.62
so yeah I'm uh

217.5 --> 227.22
pretty clear-minded

221.04 --> 231.92
at no beers and no cannabis yesterday

227.22 --> 231.92
and yeah that's certainly different

237.0 --> 243.2
wiping bank accounts okay

239.879 --> 243.2
load yard Sanford

251.04 --> 255.67999999999998
hmm

253.14 --> 255.67999999999998
okay

256.979 --> 261.78
well as far as I remember Bank of

259.139 --> 263.46000000000004
America has had a lot of issues in the

261.78 --> 266.58
past

263.46 --> 270.08
I to be fair I didn't even think it

266.58 --> 270.08
would still be around so

271.44 --> 276.96
thank you

273.5 --> 279.0
cash from accounts no oh oh great so

276.96 --> 280.79999999999995
first you make a statement this is

279.0 --> 282.72
what's happening and then you're telling

280.8 --> 285.74
me Oh you don't know if it's actually

282.72 --> 285.74
true thanks

286.86 --> 289.94
how's that helping

298.68 --> 302.96
a terat 306 good to see you

304.44 --> 308.1
foreign

305.06 --> 308.1
[Music]

311.9 --> 314.98999999999995
[Music]

341.419 --> 349.02
okay well there's a top story here there

346.08 --> 351.12
was problem with some transactions and

349.02 --> 354.24
it's been resolved

351.12 --> 357.139
so that's what I'm seeing

354.24 --> 357.139
it's a glitch

359.28 --> 365.69899999999996
apparently some accounts have been

360.96 --> 367.44
deleted but uh yeah that's not like a

365.699 --> 370.56
it's just a glitch

367.44 --> 373.21999999999997
from what I've seen just Googling it now

370.56 --> 373.22
so

380.94 --> 383.71999999999997
there you go

384.36 --> 388.759
I mean George Sanford you could have

386.34 --> 388.75899999999996
done that

389.16 --> 393.72
ah glitch the plan you mean oh you're

391.74 --> 396.84000000000003
going a little conspiracy nutty here

393.72 --> 400.97900000000004
you're Sanford so everything that

396.84 --> 403.67999999999995
happens is now with pre-planned action

400.979 --> 405.9
just to get the people you think you've

403.68 --> 408.419
been watching too many conspiracy not

405.9 --> 411.23999999999995
our videos George Sanford

408.419 --> 414.71
because it isn't sometimes things just

411.24 --> 416.639
glitch and then they fix it the next day

414.71 --> 420.5
[Music]

416.639 --> 420.5
or the same day so

422.039 --> 429.86
yeah you're wrong yeah

425.58 --> 429.85999999999996
better get that through you're wrong

432.13 --> 435.5
[Music]

435.9 --> 441.0
if you wouldn't be they would now start

438.24 --> 443.039
to make justifications as to why they've

441.0 --> 444.66
done that and they aren't it's just a

443.039 --> 446.36
glitch

444.66 --> 448.97900000000004
thank you

446.36 --> 451.28000000000003
eggs will close on the right oh yeah

448.979 --> 451.28
sure

453.36 --> 456.44
well maybe they will

456.78 --> 459.78
so

461.28 --> 464.84
some banks do that sometimes

476.039 --> 481.139
foreign

478.139 --> 481.139
okay

481.319 --> 486.47900000000004
did you say we are having a feed show

483.599 --> 488.58
today yeah if everything is all right

486.479 --> 492.56
Nathan got his computer back but was

488.58 --> 492.56
basically spending all day testing it

493.08 --> 497.69899999999996
there's a good chance it was broken

495.0 --> 499.08
again or something that's shitty and

497.699 --> 501.539
then yeah

499.08 --> 503.52
so yeah no absolute guarantees he didn't

501.539 --> 507.78
just make an announcement definitely

503.52 --> 511.25899999999996
streaming normal time just yet

507.78 --> 514.38
but considering what happened yesterday

511.259 --> 517.339
I am going to assume that he is going to

514.38 --> 517.3389999999999
do a live show today

538.08 --> 540.5600000000001
thank you

560.94 --> 564.149
[Music]

568.56 --> 572.8199999999999
yeah yesterday a couple of videos I

571.26 --> 575.04
watched Quantum of conscious was

572.82 --> 577.62
interesting again junk footage from

575.04 --> 580.0799999999999
Dragon Age that was a real

577.62 --> 582.3
flashback since I have that game and

580.08 --> 584.339
played it quite a few times

582.3 --> 587.24
back in the day I thought it was a

584.339 --> 587.24
really well made game

591.54 --> 594.5
uh

596.88 --> 603.72
yeah flat so it went reviewing Nathan's

601.14 --> 607.92
performance again with Earth Chronicles

603.72 --> 612.48
but I yeah I'm not interested I mean

607.92 --> 615.3199999999999
I've already seen that like twice now so

612.48 --> 615.32
uh

617.16 --> 621.18
oh yeah by the way Nathan did make a

619.2 --> 626.4590000000001
Members Only video

621.18 --> 628.4499999999999
saying live shows will start tomorrow so

626.459 --> 630.06
it should be starting today

628.45 --> 633.4200000000001
[Music]

630.06 --> 636.5999999999999
uh yeah that was pretty much it

633.42 --> 637.62
oh yeah I did watch another film

636.6 --> 640.94
again

637.62 --> 643.75
The Pledge that's Jack Nicholson

640.94 --> 645.7790000000001
very very subtle movie

643.75 --> 648.839
[Music]

645.779 --> 652.279
very psychological

648.839 --> 652.2790000000001
drama oriented

653.12 --> 657.839
[Music]

655.68 --> 662.3599999999999
and yeah was

657.839 --> 662.36
a very good movie I thought

666.18 --> 671.8199999999999
it's basically about a cop that's really

668.82 --> 674.9590000000001
a good a real good guy

671.82 --> 678.6600000000001
a bit of stoic real classical good guy

674.959 --> 681.26
Jack Nicholson and he like as he's

678.66 --> 681.26
retiring

681.48 --> 688.5600000000001
like some freaky rapist or something

685.62 --> 691.44
yeah a rapist apparently like killed

688.56 --> 693.2399999999999
some little kid and he is basically

691.44 --> 694.44
obsessed with that

693.24 --> 699.36
and

694.44 --> 701.4590000000001
makes a vow like the the mother may let

699.36 --> 705.0
makes him make a vow

701.459 --> 707.04
to find the killer even though yeah then

705.0 --> 709.079
supposedly the killer gets caught some

707.04 --> 710.519
handicapped person

709.079 --> 713.64
and

710.519 --> 715.5600000000001
they just assume it's him and he kills

713.64 --> 718.14
himself even like

715.56 --> 719.9399999999999
cycle it's very psychological

718.14 --> 722.22
and then they just assume they got him

719.94 --> 723.72
but like the guy is not letting it go

722.22 --> 726.6600000000001
the main character and he's thinks like

723.72 --> 728.64
no it's he's still out there

726.66 --> 730.4399999999999
but he still steps yeah he's still

728.64 --> 732.779
retiring and then he's just basically

730.44 --> 735.0
stays obsessed with it and

732.779 --> 739.22
tries to figure it out

735.0 --> 739.22
she's holding on to that pledge

740.94 --> 747.12
but then yeah like it's really a weird

744.48 --> 749.7
type of movie it's like a good end but

747.12 --> 751.019
not a good end

749.7 --> 753.4200000000001
foreign

751.019 --> 756.24
because he basically gets on track of

753.42 --> 758.16
who is most likely the Killer

756.24 --> 759.66
and then

758.16 --> 762.12
well

759.66 --> 764.3389999999999
as the movie shows he gets into an

762.12 --> 766.8
accident and gets killed before he

764.339 --> 770.1600000000001
basically could get caught

766.8 --> 774.24
it's really bizarre movie like that but

770.16 --> 775.8
it was just really well made very so

774.24 --> 780.0
anyway

775.8 --> 782.459
Hollywood movies some of them are good

780.0 --> 786.019
that's what I watched

782.459 --> 786.0189999999999
went to bed very early

786.18 --> 791.66
and had a really good sleep

788.579 --> 791.66
and a nice morning

791.76 --> 798.74
also been cleaning up my browser a bit

794.339 --> 798.74
all these links that no longer work

800.22 --> 805.86
so many links like literally my bookmark

803.519 --> 807.899
list my main bookmark list was just

805.86 --> 810.42
completely full

807.899 --> 812.88
so I cleaned that up a bit should do

810.42 --> 815.579
that some more

812.88 --> 817.68
but uh yeah I already did quite a bit

815.579 --> 821.0
it's interesting looking through some

817.68 --> 821.0
older links as well

821.04 --> 828.079
I mean some of those links were like

824.22 --> 828.0790000000001
14 years old or more

829.079 --> 832.8199999999999
now some of them still work anyway

834.6 --> 839.399
Channel space Buster yeah yeah it is a

837.24 --> 840.9590000000001
good Channel isn't it

839.399 --> 842.279
letter Sage

840.959 --> 844.56
yeah good

842.279 --> 847.579
it is a really good like he makes it

844.56 --> 847.579
really great videos

847.68 --> 854.3599999999999
very detailed

850.62 --> 854.36
a lot of background research

861.18 --> 863.7199999999999
right

868.56 --> 871.56
uh

873.54 --> 881.279
also checked up on like mind in the Box

877.56 --> 882.899
and like they got like the older sites

881.279 --> 885.54
they don't work anywhere they have work

882.899 --> 888.0
on flash and it doesn't work anymore but

885.54 --> 890.399
they're still doing stuff I I figured

888.0 --> 894.0
out some

890.399 --> 898.94
other sites apparently they're like

894.0 --> 898.94
mine in the box is merging with Fakes

899.899 --> 905.579
t-h-y-x

901.8 --> 907.079
and La yeah I've seen a post in like two

905.579 --> 909.3599999999999
thousand

907.079 --> 911.3389999999999
uh 21.

909.36 --> 913.44
so they're still doing things still

911.339 --> 914.6990000000001
making new songs they yeah money in the

913.44 --> 916.3800000000001
Box apparently has a whole bunch of new

914.699 --> 919.74
CDs but

916.38 --> 921.779
I don't know anything about it so

919.74 --> 923.82
but I would like to

921.779 --> 926.3389999999999
see somewhere if I could get an

923.82 --> 928.6990000000001
opportunity to check out their new

926.339 --> 928.6990000000001
cities

929.82 --> 934.5600000000001
it's probably not going to be as awesome

931.8 --> 938.4799999999999
as like some of the older songs that I

934.56 --> 938.4799999999999
still listen a lot but who knows

943.019 --> 947.279
but it's cool to see that they're still

944.639 --> 950.04
going at least he's not like some

947.279 --> 952.32
experimental

950.04 --> 955.26
some medical experiment victim or

952.32 --> 957.48
something you still going

982.03 --> 986.519
[Music]

983.72 --> 989.1800000000001
all right also continuing watching on

986.519 --> 989.18
Benjamin

990.98 --> 996.899
maneuvering from his vacation in the

994.44 --> 999.0600000000001
high mountains ski vacation or holiday

996.899 --> 1003.259
that he had

999.06 --> 1005.5999999999999
back to farming detail

1003.259 --> 1009.82
but yeah so I'm watching Tuesday's show

1005.6 --> 1009.82
haven't gotten to Wednesdays yet

1010.339 --> 1016.0400000000001
but yeah it's great

1013.04 --> 1016.04
foreign

1037.819 --> 1042.319
right so yeah I'm pretty much an open

1040.819 --> 1044.1789999999999
book here

1042.319 --> 1046.6
I rolled out everything that I talked

1044.179 --> 1046.6000000000001
about yesterday

1047.419 --> 1050.0790000000002
foreign

1064.039 --> 1071.78
and yeah a little hungry I did not have

1067.64 --> 1073.5800000000002
that elaborate uh dinner yesterday

1071.78 --> 1076.039
but yeah

1073.58 --> 1078.3999999999999
should still have some for today and

1076.039 --> 1082.039
yeah after that tomorrow I'm gonna be

1078.4 --> 1083.72
completely run out of all forms of food

1082.039 --> 1087.46
so

1083.72 --> 1087.46
I could really use some support

1093.08 --> 1098.6599999999999
right because now I got 15 bucks that I

1096.44 --> 1101.419
got yesterday on the PayPal

1098.66 --> 1105.76
and that's it that's all I got to spend

1101.419 --> 1105.76
on whatever I'm going to be needing

1107.9 --> 1110.6200000000001
right now

1117.49 --> 1122.6200000000001
[Music]

1119.5 --> 1122.62
thank you

1124.0 --> 1129.559
all right so yeah guys I mean give me a

1128.24 --> 1131.74
suggestion what do you want me to talk

1129.559 --> 1131.74
about

1135.2 --> 1139.16
George Sanford already brought up the

1137.059 --> 1141.9189999999999
bank but yeah that's issue has simply

1139.16 --> 1144.64
been resolved so there's not a lot to

1141.919 --> 1144.64
talk about there

1164.78 --> 1166.96
foreign

1170.919 --> 1176.6000000000001
alternative black hole Theory really

1185.6 --> 1188.26
okay

1192.46 --> 1199.96
so this channel the missing research is

1196.64 --> 1203.7800000000002
seems to be a lot trying to figure out

1199.96 --> 1207.559
refraction effects from what I'm seeing

1203.78 --> 1209.6
so a little bit like uh Sky free except

1207.559 --> 1212.24
they are specifically focusing on

1209.6 --> 1213.9189999999999
basically boat models on lakes that's

1212.24 --> 1214.88
what they did and yeah in their living

1213.919 --> 1217.2800000000002
room

1214.88 --> 1220.2800000000002
so using the

1217.28 --> 1220.28
uh

1222.26 --> 1228.039
angular size limit more the diffraction

1225.62 --> 1228.039
effect

1228.32 --> 1233.78
but yeah seems like could be potentially

1231.26 --> 1236.799
interesting Channel

1233.78 --> 1236.799
so you can start water

1237.74 --> 1244.28
and I see yeah duh that why do you think

1240.98 --> 1247.76
I gave you the link this is

1244.28 --> 1250.24
I lit flat or say don't you remember why

1247.76 --> 1253.52
the hell do you think I I told you about

1250.24 --> 1257.78
spacebusters it's because of their

1253.52 --> 1260.9
videos on viruses specifically

1257.78 --> 1263.28
so yeah no [ __ ] I've seen that that's

1260.9 --> 1269.38
why I recommended the channel

1263.28 --> 1269.3799999999999
[Music]

1283.039 --> 1288.62
foreign

1285.62 --> 1288.62
early

1289.4 --> 1293.1200000000001
yeah this is my job you [ __ ] [ __ ]

1291.74 --> 1294.98
don't you go [ __ ] kill yourself

1293.12 --> 1300.3999999999999
scumbag

1294.98 --> 1300.4
yeah die die troll die

1305.659 --> 1308.38
uh

1311.559 --> 1316.94
Chronicles argument about the Sun not

1314.24 --> 1318.679
changing size Ah that's a good one yeah

1316.94 --> 1319.76
well I've addressed that plenty of times

1318.679 --> 1323.74
yeah

1319.76 --> 1328.46
the entire situation with the disc

1323.74 --> 1331.46
earthers yeah the disc reifying earthers

1328.46 --> 1334.58
is that they bring on that ridiculous

1331.46 --> 1337.52
argument that originates from David

1334.58 --> 1338.78
Weiss who's been harping about that

1337.52 --> 1342.3799999999999
[ __ ]

1338.78 --> 1344.78
for like six years

1342.38 --> 1347.0
saying oh look it goes to the Horizon

1344.78 --> 1349.76
it's angular size yeah yeah that's all

1347.0 --> 1353.059
super cute except it's complete nonsense

1349.76 --> 1356.24
because as its angular size decreases

1353.059 --> 1358.58
its angular speed isn't decreasing

1356.24 --> 1359.84
there's no way in hell that could ever

1358.58 --> 1362.4189999999999
be

1359.84 --> 1364.22
an angular size decrease because of

1362.419 --> 1366.76
perspective so

1364.22 --> 1366.76
yeah

1367.1 --> 1375.26
I mean why would the sun be changing in

1371.36 --> 1377.84
angular size if it's a freaking hologram

1375.26 --> 1382.46
and it doesn't have a literal position

1377.84 --> 1385.34
over the disc Earth in order to have it

1382.46 --> 1386.8400000000001
decrease in angular size because of its

1385.34 --> 1389.9599999999998
distance

1386.84 --> 1393.6789999999999
that's a reification of the sun into a

1389.96 --> 1395.9
physical object in euclidean space

1393.679 --> 1400.039
yeah and I've been harping on this

1395.9 --> 1403.0590000000002
argument since 2016. yeah

1400.039 --> 1403.059
just for the record

1403.76 --> 1407.62
blue build Evolution hello by the way

1408.32 --> 1414.22
yeah laser light I don't know what

1410.36 --> 1414.2199999999998
you're talking about it's nonsense

1429.08 --> 1435.02
if you're gonna have a weird car

1432.799 --> 1437.6589999999999
without a horn I mean I don't even think

1435.02 --> 1438.9189999999999
you need a horn if you can use a Bell or

1437.659 --> 1442.22
whatever

1438.919 --> 1444.38
as long as you don't like put on a a

1442.22 --> 1446.9
train horn or something that's way too

1444.38 --> 1449.0800000000002
loud you could use probably whatever you

1446.9 --> 1449.0800000000002
like

1450.98 --> 1455.6200000000001
although I am not entirely sure about

1453.26 --> 1455.62
that

1462.799 --> 1466.6
I would have to look up like

1467.96 --> 1475.159
laws about that like traffic laws and I

1471.799 --> 1478.039
don't want to laser lie yeah you could

1475.159 --> 1481.0390000000002
do that you could literally just Google

1478.039 --> 1485.86
traffic learn laws

1481.039 --> 1485.86
horns Netherlands yeah

1487.4 --> 1491.419
it's kind of a silly question to ask me

1489.62 --> 1493.52
like why the hell would you think I

1491.419 --> 1495.6200000000001
would know about that even

1493.52 --> 1498.799
I mean I could have

1495.62 --> 1501.76
per chance but

1498.799 --> 1501.76
I mean come on

1501.99 --> 1505.18
[Music]

1513.02 --> 1517.94
I said ah you got the the special salts

1515.6 --> 1520.36
okay cool letter Sage that should be

1517.94 --> 1520.3600000000001
interesting

1521.179 --> 1523.7800000000002
foreign

1526.96 --> 1533.659
injected them with fire well no it's not

1529.82 --> 1537.039
exactly viruses though I mean viruses

1533.659 --> 1537.0390000000002
aren't even real things

1537.44 --> 1542.059
literally like they don't exist it's a

1539.84 --> 1544.76
completely fictional fabrication there's

1542.059 --> 1549.58
no evidence there's anything like

1544.76 --> 1552.14
anything about it now bacteria yes

1549.58 --> 1555.08
scientists that did tests that have

1552.14 --> 1558.3200000000002
actually injected themselves with just

1555.08 --> 1561.1589999999999
pure bacteria not with like the the

1558.32 --> 1566.1789999999999
gross [ __ ] on top of that

1561.159 --> 1568.159
or like fimerosol Mercury additives

1566.179 --> 1570.38
right no added they just the raw

1568.159 --> 1573.67
bacteria just in there and yeah it

1570.38 --> 1576.8690000000001
didn't do anything that's right

1573.67 --> 1576.8690000000001
[Music]

1578.24 --> 1582.74
so whatever they're supposedly injecting

1580.88 --> 1585.2600000000002
whenever they're supposedly life

1582.74 --> 1588.08
injecting bacteria in you through the

1585.26 --> 1592.64
classical vaccine method

1588.08 --> 1595.6999999999998
it is already extremely dubious

1592.64 --> 1599.48
right I suspected for quite a while but

1595.7 --> 1600.74
it's basically the the real injection is

1599.48 --> 1602.779
the additives

1600.74 --> 1605.48
that's what they do it they do it for

1602.779 --> 1609.2
the additives they add the fimerosol and

1605.48 --> 1613.1
other stuff specifically not because of

1609.2 --> 1616.7
it actually does anything on the

1613.1 --> 1618.98
yeah the injected virus or bacteria it's

1616.7 --> 1620.9
because that is the effect they just

1618.98 --> 1623.48
want to inject you with that

1620.9 --> 1625.52
that's what they want that's why they

1623.48 --> 1628.84
put that [ __ ] in everything if they

1625.52 --> 1628.84
didn't it wouldn't do anything

1634.82 --> 1638.62
any steamy traveler good to see you

1653.179 --> 1658.8200000000002
right I'm liking these questions keep it

1655.7 --> 1661.5800000000002
rolling keep it coming I'll answer them

1658.82 --> 1664.8799999999999
as long as it's to the point with

1661.58 --> 1664.8799999999999
anything yeah

1678.98 --> 1683.3600000000001
right laser light do you have any

1681.38 --> 1685.5390000000002
question that's actually relevant to

1683.36 --> 1685.539
anything

1685.82 --> 1689.8999999999999
because I don't like it when people get

1687.919 --> 1692.2990000000002
in here and then ask questions about

1689.9 --> 1694.94
things that are just not interesting nor

1692.299 --> 1697.6399999999999
relevant to anything

1694.94 --> 1699.679
it's quite annoying

1697.64 --> 1701.6000000000001
makes me think you're a troll and if I

1699.679 --> 1703.22
see you do that more often I will kick

1701.6 --> 1705.4399999999998
you out

1703.22 --> 1709.0
so if you have any relevant questions

1705.44 --> 1709.0
please ask those

1714.799 --> 1720.799
yeah I I don't want to hear questions

1717.44 --> 1725.779
like oh what an officer really arrest

1720.799 --> 1728.36
you if you go jaywalking

1725.779 --> 1731.059
going diagonally across the street which

1728.36 --> 1733.82
I think originally was illegal

1731.059 --> 1735.559
or while illegal it's you're not

1733.82 --> 1738.1399999999999
supposed to do that

1735.559 --> 1742.1589999999999
right it's not an interesting question

1738.14 --> 1744.26
nobody gives a [ __ ] you get it

1742.159 --> 1746.48
so don't ask those types of questions

1744.26 --> 1750.74
yeah I don't care about those questions

1746.48 --> 1753.02
I don't care about oh did Were You There

1750.74 --> 1755.24
When this stupid little thing happened

1753.02 --> 1757.46
out there allegedly yeah go [ __ ]

1755.24 --> 1758.96
yourself yeah I don't care for those

1757.46 --> 1761.059
[ __ ] questions

1758.96 --> 1763.7
if I see another one of those types of

1761.059 --> 1764.6589999999999
questions I will immediately ban you you

1763.7 --> 1767.3600000000001
get it

1764.659 --> 1769.39
so ask a question that actually has a

1767.36 --> 1774.4699999999998
freaking point

1769.39 --> 1774.47
[Music]

1776.98 --> 1780.059
[Music]

1782.179 --> 1785.779
all right also had a Skype call with

1784.1 --> 1788.24
rest I had yesterday

1785.779 --> 1790.399
he's doing very well

1788.24 --> 1794.299
what topics are allowed topics that have

1790.399 --> 1799.1
a [ __ ] point Timothy a point

1794.299 --> 1801.2
so not about stupid traffic laws or were

1799.1 --> 1804.279
you there with this stupid nonsensical

1801.2 --> 1804.279
event happened yeah

1805.58 --> 1810.62
not that

1807.5 --> 1813.88
questions about subjects questions that

1810.62 --> 1813.8799999999999
are actually interesting

1815.12 --> 1819.32
or bring up some event that you think

1817.7 --> 1821.8990000000001
might be unfolding and you like an

1819.32 --> 1825.1
analysis of it right but something that

1821.899 --> 1825.1
actually has a point

1826.179 --> 1830.919
it shouldn't be too tough to figure that

1828.74 --> 1830.919
out

1855.08 --> 1857.559
all right

1857.659 --> 1862.6000000000001
anyway flutter stage good that you're

1859.82 --> 1862.6
looking into that

1866.899 --> 1872.1399999999999
uh

1868.46 --> 1872.14
all right what else is going on

1876.5 --> 1882.279
Davos is continuing but it's it's high

1879.86 --> 1882.279
tension

1885.679 --> 1888.74
there seems to be a lot of heat and

1887.779 --> 1892.539
pressure

1888.74 --> 1892.539
um like the whole Waf

1893.179 --> 1897.8600000000001
situation

1896.12 --> 1900.7399999999998
but they're still pushing it through

1897.86 --> 1902.779
while like our prime minister is

1900.74 --> 1905.059
literally just like

1902.779 --> 1906.98
being a complete actor trying to

1905.059 --> 1910.84
Gaslight everyone

1906.98 --> 1910.84
but nobody's buying it

1912.02 --> 1916.7
like he's saying oh our country is doing

1914.24 --> 1918.6200000000001
great oh yeah no it's doing like the

1916.7 --> 1922.059
worst it's ever done

1918.62 --> 1922.059
in like a hundred years

1923.6 --> 1927.1
but it's not true eight years

1928.059 --> 1933.799
foreign

1929.779 --> 1936.88
like after World War II since then it's

1933.799 --> 1936.8799999999999
it's doing terrible

1938.44 --> 1944.8600000000001
financial situation is growing out of

1941.24 --> 1944.86
control it's becoming intainable

1945.08 --> 1949.1789999999999
as just we're being besieged

1950.84 --> 1958.72
country is just getting strangled slowly

1954.44 --> 1958.72
and people are absolutely sick of it

1958.779 --> 1966.14
what our prime minister is still acting

1962.539 --> 1969.279
like no we're doing great yes yes oh so

1966.14 --> 1969.279
great great

1969.46 --> 1976.22
so like the record size delegation from

1973.039 --> 1978.919
the Netherlands cabinet going to Davos

1976.22 --> 1981.34
is certainly not attracting any positive

1978.919 --> 1981.3400000000001
attention

1982.7 --> 1987.799
but there seemed to be the way they're

1985.82 --> 1989.48
acting is like they just don't care

1987.799 --> 1992.539
anymore

1989.48 --> 1994.519
these these wvf puppets in our

1992.539 --> 1997.46
government they're acting like they

1994.519 --> 2000.279
don't care anymore at all

1997.46 --> 2003.279
like what we think or what we do

2000.279 --> 2007.12
they will just lie straight to your face

2003.279 --> 2009.34
like provably lie

2007.12 --> 2012.399
and they don't care

2009.34 --> 2014.1589999999999
so they're going for broke or until

2012.399 --> 2016.12
death

2014.159 --> 2018.8990000000001
yeah

2016.12 --> 2018.899
could be coming

2019.779 --> 2026.279
kind of counting on that

2022.779 --> 2031.059
because they absolutely deserve

2026.279 --> 2031.059
a maximum penalty

2031.179 --> 2035.74
death penalty in my opinion something

2033.279 --> 2038.32
that's not technically

2035.74 --> 2040.539
done in the Netherlands but I think that

2038.32 --> 2044.46
for this specific occasion we should

2040.539 --> 2044.46
absolutely make the exception

2044.679 --> 2050.08
and I think there should be should

2046.539 --> 2052.619
remain an exception for these types of

2050.08 --> 2052.619
occasions

2058.78 --> 2064.0
Mr resign uh right well she wasn't doing

2062.2 --> 2067.54
great

2064.0 --> 2069.82
you could like in past few years she's

2067.54 --> 2072.639
gotten like more high tension nervous

2069.82 --> 2074.2000000000003
and more and more so she's probably just

2072.639 --> 2076.679
having a mental breakdown and she can't

2074.2 --> 2078.46
handle it anymore

2076.679 --> 2080.32
she should

2078.46 --> 2083.08
she should be having a mental breakdown

2080.32 --> 2084.3990000000003
what she's doing is monstrous and

2083.08 --> 2086.5
satanic

2084.399 --> 2089.1389999999997
and you can think that that's all cool

2086.5 --> 2093.179
and that you can do it but yeah God

2089.139 --> 2093.179
inside it yet disagrees with that

2099.82 --> 2105.4
right and that counts for everyone

2102.46 --> 2106.96
including Klaus Schwab himself I mean he

2105.4 --> 2108.64
is suffering right now for doing this

2106.96 --> 2110.8
he's not going to give up but he is

2108.64 --> 2113.44
suffering and he knows that it's not

2110.8 --> 2115.8390000000004
going to end well for him

2113.44 --> 2118.06
he knows he's probably not gonna make it

2115.839 --> 2120.66
past the next decade

2118.06 --> 2120.66
alive

2127.42 --> 2132.7200000000003
right so thanks for that update I had no

2129.7 --> 2132.72
idea George Sanford

2143.92 --> 2147.099
right

2145.48 --> 2149.68
see Timothy

2147.099 --> 2153.1600000000003
you can't talk about things as long as

2149.68 --> 2157.2599999999998
it has a freaking point

2153.16 --> 2157.2599999999998
yeah subjects with a point

2158.22 --> 2165.3999999999996
is it that hard or are you so mentally

2162.04 --> 2167.38
deranged that you literally don't even

2165.4 --> 2169.0
want to talk about anything that matters

2167.38 --> 2172.9
anymore

2169.0 --> 2175.9
like some of these [ __ ] trolls

2172.9 --> 2178.7400000000002
keep coming in and just throwing out

2175.9 --> 2178.7400000000002
garbage

2178.96 --> 2186.7200000000003
like nonsense remarks

2182.8 --> 2186.7200000000003
that it just literally a waste of time

2192.099 --> 2197.32
the point

2194.619 --> 2199.359
okay hello mystical RockHounds and

2197.32 --> 2201.07
fossils

2199.359 --> 2210.489
Rock hounding

2201.07 --> 2210.489
[Music]

2229.72 --> 2234.2799999999997
is that it mystical Rock hounding is

2232.06 --> 2237.52
that what you're gonna say is that it

2234.28 --> 2239.88
are you trying to be a smart ass on me

2237.52 --> 2239.88
or something

2241.68 --> 2247.72
yes Rufus I still have the p900 I

2244.9 --> 2249.9
literally showed it last week for [ __ ]

2247.72 --> 2249.8999999999996
sake

2253.96 --> 2258.76
what's next are you gonna ask me if

2255.82 --> 2260.1400000000003
that's a crossbow behind me how [ __ ]

2258.76 --> 2262.6600000000003
original

2260.14 --> 2265.1189999999997
I mean do you guys pay any [ __ ]

2262.66 --> 2267.0989999999997
attention to anything that I do you just

2265.119 --> 2269.1400000000003
come here and ask random stupid

2267.099 --> 2271.119
questions that you should know the

2269.14 --> 2273.2999999999997
answer to because I've been answering

2271.119 --> 2277.56
them like a lot

2273.3 --> 2277.5600000000004
hundreds of times if not more

2281.68 --> 2287.02
oh hahaha very funny mystical

2285.28 --> 2287.98
that with that attitude you might just

2287.02 --> 2290.33
want to

2287.98 --> 2292.18
stay out

2290.33 --> 2295.619
[Music]

2292.18 --> 2295.6189999999997
I want something to talk about

2295.66 --> 2300.52
I got a very clear mind today because

2297.7 --> 2302.9199999999996
I'm like completely sober it's not super

2300.52 --> 2306.339
Pleasant I have to say

2302.92 --> 2309.16
but uh yeah I don't wanna just this is

2306.339 --> 2313.18
not a place where you can just

2309.16 --> 2315.339
hang around and be [ __ ] you got it

2313.18 --> 2316.72
you want to be [ __ ] go somewhere

2315.339 --> 2319.18
else

2316.72 --> 2322.02
have a point

2319.18 --> 2322.02
Bring It On

2326.18 --> 2329.41
[Music]

2332.38 --> 2336.06
no Supreme knowing it's you

2342.4 --> 2345.06
foreign

2376.06 --> 2379.06
foreign

2398.94 --> 2404.859
well if nobody's gonna bring on anything

2401.74 --> 2407.14
if you're just waiting waiting for

2404.859 --> 2409.2999999999997
something to happen I guess I'll just

2407.14 --> 2411.22
dig back in other things that I've

2409.3 --> 2413.98
talked about in recent shows and start

2411.22 --> 2416.98
recycling then

2413.98 --> 2416.98
foreign

2433.72 --> 2438.2999999999997
all right so I could talk about the

2435.64 --> 2441.22
whole Egyptian lore

2438.3 --> 2443.98
reincarnation situation some more if

2441.22 --> 2445.72
anybody gives a [ __ ] about that at all I

2443.98 --> 2447.7
mean it's not like you guys are bringing

2445.72 --> 2450.8199999999997
it up I have to be the one bring it up

2447.7 --> 2453.54
so apparently you don't give a [ __ ] I do

2450.82 --> 2453.54
right

2454.18 --> 2458.3799999999997
or we could talk about artificial

2456.579 --> 2460.42
intelligence some more there's been a

2458.38 --> 2463.78
lot of rumors about that and a lot of

2460.42 --> 2466.359
paranoia [ __ ] oh the end of the

2463.78 --> 2467.28
world microbots they're all gonna eat Us

2466.359 --> 2470.44
Alive

2467.28 --> 2474.76
oh yeah but where when when where is it

2470.44 --> 2477.4
yeah that shit's been in existence for

2474.76 --> 2480.1600000000003
decades yeah we're all still here

2477.4 --> 2482.14
there's not a gray Zone somewhere on

2480.16 --> 2483.8199999999997
Earth where there's this gray ooze

2482.14 --> 2484.96
that's consuming everything yeah it

2483.82 --> 2488.02
doesn't exist

2484.96 --> 2491.2
so you might want to cut down on the

2488.02 --> 2494.14
paranoia porn considering artificial

2491.2 --> 2497.98
intelligence [ __ ]

2494.14 --> 2502.3799999999997
right also that what is it the GP thing

2497.98 --> 2502.38
whatever is getting a lot of attention

2504.4 --> 2508.2000000000003
it's getting like headlines

2510.94 --> 2515.02
crutch is still the scariest movie in my

2513.46 --> 2518.7
opinion okay

2515.02 --> 2518.7
it is kind of scary yeah

2519.7 --> 2521.8799999999997
foreign

2523.72 --> 2528.3999999999996
do you think the powers are done with

2525.76 --> 2531.82
this virus plan no no they will keep

2528.4 --> 2534.04
going and going and going and going

2531.82 --> 2538.06
flutter Sage you know why

2534.04 --> 2539.14
because their plans can't work without

2538.06 --> 2541.0
it

2539.14 --> 2543.8199999999997
yeah

2541.0 --> 2545.44
so even though everybody in the [ __ ]

2543.82 --> 2547.6600000000003
world by then

2545.44 --> 2549.7000000000003
is gonna know it's all [ __ ] they

2547.66 --> 2552.0989999999997
might even become aware that viruses

2549.7 --> 2555.46
themselves are a lie a science fiction

2552.099 --> 2557.8
construct that was made up

2555.46 --> 2562.599
they're still gonna do it because it's

2557.8 --> 2564.46
not about the virus whatever it's about

2562.599 --> 2566.98
locking you down

2564.46 --> 2569.079
forcing you to do ridiculous things that

2566.98 --> 2570.7
don't contribute to anything or prevent

2569.079 --> 2572.619
anything because there is nothing to

2570.7 --> 2577.3799999999997
prevent it doesn't exist

2572.619 --> 2577.38
and making you take poison shots

2577.48 --> 2580.7400000000002
that's what it's really about

2581.74 --> 2588.0989999999997
it's just a slow kill system that's well

2584.56 --> 2589.96
not so super slow anymore

2588.099 --> 2592.0
that's all it is

2589.96 --> 2594.28
so they're not going to stop even though

2592.0 --> 2596.14
it might be completely officially

2594.28 --> 2600.46
recognized that viruses don't actually

2596.14 --> 2603.16
exist they'll still do it you get it

2600.46 --> 2605.98
still do it

2603.16 --> 2608.92
and they will keep doing it it will be

2605.98 --> 2610.72
their stupid Wizardry lies that's how

2608.92 --> 2612.94
people will see it but they will still

2610.72 --> 2614.339
do it and there will still be numpties

2612.94 --> 2617.92
falling for it

2614.339 --> 2619.66
and unfortunately young dreamers that

2617.92 --> 2622.66
really are made to believe in it because

2619.66 --> 2626.98
somebody up there really hates them for

2622.66 --> 2630.22
being naive yeah so if for example me

2626.98 --> 2633.46
from 25 years ago would be living in

2630.22 --> 2637.14
this age I would now be dead because I

2633.46 --> 2637.14
would have [ __ ] taken that shot

2637.839 --> 2642.72
out of idealism

2639.839 --> 2645.2799999999997
and then I would deserve the horrible

2642.72 --> 2646.48
horrifying death that would be coming to

2645.28 --> 2650.3190000000004
me

2646.48 --> 2653.56
and the [ __ ] crazy thing about it I

2650.319 --> 2656.14
knew that I knew that 20 years ago I was

2653.56 --> 2658.06
afraid that I would still be the way I

2656.14 --> 2660.96
was back then and I would get myself

2658.06 --> 2664.72
killed I was absolutely

2660.96 --> 2667.2400000000002
terrified Beyond Comprehension that I

2664.72 --> 2669.7
would be fooled into taking a shot yeah

2667.24 --> 2672.4599999999996
it's a big part of my vision

2669.7 --> 2675.3999999999996
big part of that 80-year nightmare

2672.46 --> 2677.38
Vision was the terror

2675.4 --> 2680.619
of a suggestion that it would be

2677.38 --> 2683.619
inevitable that it would take a shot

2680.619 --> 2686.02
it was a big part of that yeah

2683.619 --> 2690.2200000000003
25 years ago

2686.02 --> 2692.859
yeah 25 years ago

2690.22 --> 2695.7999999999997
I knew this [ __ ] was gonna happen

2692.859 --> 2697.5989999999997
was absolutely no point in bringing it

2695.8 --> 2699.819
up though

2697.599 --> 2702.04
because people would just not listen

2699.819 --> 2705.04
they wouldn't listen now they'll listen

2702.04 --> 2707.079
now that so many people are dead and

2705.04 --> 2709.42
mutilated

2707.079 --> 2712.0600000000004
but back then would be no point I mean

2709.42 --> 2712.859
effectively Alex Jones has been harping

2712.06 --> 2716.14
about

2712.859 --> 2718.0
mandatory vaccine [ __ ] like even 12

2716.14 --> 2721.54
years ago

2718.0 --> 2723.819
and nobody saw this nobody like all

2721.54 --> 2726.4
those people

2723.819 --> 2728.38
out there

2726.4 --> 2730.56
with preliminary War they didn't care

2728.38 --> 2732.88
they still

2730.56 --> 2735.16
continued on and a lot of them are now

2732.88 --> 2736.78
dead

2735.16 --> 2737.68
and we don't really get to hear the

2736.78 --> 2740.3190000000004
numbers

2737.68 --> 2742.2999999999997
they hide the death numbers you get you

2740.319 --> 2744.4
realize that right they hide the numbers

2742.3 --> 2746.8590000000004
it's not public they don't

2744.4 --> 2749.579
tell you

2746.859 --> 2749.5789999999997
the numbers

2750.7 --> 2754.359
and if all possible they try to

2752.8 --> 2757.9
basically

2754.359 --> 2759.2799999999997
get on their death certificate another

2757.9 --> 2761.56
cause

2759.28 --> 2765.28
they don't I don't think they even allow

2761.56 --> 2768.819
people to be registered deceased because

2765.28 --> 2771.76
of like a vaccine reaction I don't think

2768.819 --> 2774.7
they even allow that to be notified

2771.76 --> 2777.7000000000003
on a on a coroner report

2774.7 --> 2780.5989999999997
right so yeah there are a lot more

2777.7 --> 2780.5989999999997
people dying

2782.2 --> 2786.16
they even call it in general like excess

2784.9 --> 2788.2000000000003
death

2786.16 --> 2790.24
there's a lot of excess death like

2788.2 --> 2793.18
unusual numbers that never really happen

2790.24 --> 2795.3999999999996
it's out of balance it's

2793.18 --> 2798.24
that's what's happening the statistical

2795.4 --> 2798.2400000000002
thing right

2802.96 --> 2805.44
foreign

2809.819 --> 2814.66
S I don't care

2813.04 --> 2818.22
why the [ __ ]

2814.66 --> 2818.22
why are you asking me

2822.88 --> 2828.7200000000003
I don't think any form of consultation

2825.64 --> 2828.72
is illegal though

2830.7 --> 2835.3799999999997
but I don't know what he does with that

2833.38 --> 2838.9
I don't care

2835.38 --> 2840.88
cryptocurrency is a waste of time in my

2838.9 --> 2844.8
opinion although yeah there will be

2840.88 --> 2844.8
people that are pretty good with it

2854.079 --> 2859.42
what the hell are you talking about

2855.64 --> 2862.24
Jason Brown recap had a sleeping what

2859.42 --> 2864.76
the hell does that mean

2862.24 --> 2866.7999999999997
what does that mean

2864.76 --> 2870.119
could you ask a question that is

2866.8 --> 2870.119
actually comprehensible

2873.7 --> 2875.9399999999996
foreign

2882.18 --> 2888.46
I know yeah

2885.0 --> 2890.98
unfortunately though I let my paranoia

2888.46 --> 2892.359
at the time completely cut me off from

2890.98 --> 2897.119
society

2892.359 --> 2897.119
I used it as an excuse not to engage

2899.98 --> 2905.14
which in retrospect was a huge huge

2904.24 --> 2907.0
mistake

2905.14 --> 2908.3799999999997
although there's probably nothing I

2907.0 --> 2911.02
could have done to avoid it because

2908.38 --> 2912.339
that's just the way I was I was

2911.02 --> 2916.319
just

2912.339 --> 2916.319
not ready to handle this world

2917.56 --> 2922.2999999999997
at all

2919.0 --> 2926.91
I'm not entirely sure whether I'm now

2922.3 --> 2928.7200000000003
but I'm more capable I know that

2926.91 --> 2932.7999999999997
[Music]

2928.72 --> 2935.319
but 20 years ago no no not at all

2932.8 --> 2937.7200000000003
like not at all

2935.319 --> 2940.24
what I was thinking about mostly is how

2937.72 --> 2942.2799999999997
can I completely flee societies to some

2940.24 --> 2944.68
cabin in the woods and like never see

2942.28 --> 2950.2200000000003
anybody ever again that's what I wanted

2944.68 --> 2950.22
back then what a [ __ ] waste of time

2953.619 --> 2958.359
I really wish I just had some kind of a

2956.26 --> 2961.8390000000004
parent that would have literally dragged

2958.359 --> 2964.48
me by The Heirs and just like hey Arwen

2961.839 --> 2966.88
you [ __ ] little [ __ ] you think

2964.48 --> 2968.98
you're [ __ ] God no you're a loser if

2966.88 --> 2971.38
you keep this up you're going to have to

2968.98 --> 2974.26
do this now like

2971.38 --> 2976.1800000000003
you're gonna do this job now no you

2974.26 --> 2977.26
don't get a joy you are going to do it

2976.18 --> 2979.66
now

2977.26 --> 2983.1600000000003
I'm gonna beat your ass

2979.66 --> 2986.859
I wish I had that back then I really do

2983.16 --> 2989.3799999999997
with no no oh no you're just gonna have

2986.859 --> 2994.06
to figure it out yourself I'll [ __ ]

2989.38 --> 2996.819
thanks Dad Mom thanks a [ __ ] lot

2994.06 --> 2999.4
for letting me mutter

2996.819 --> 3001.5
and to drip off in a corner not

2999.4 --> 3005.54
integrating thanks a lot for just

3001.5 --> 3005.54
letting that happen that's great

3008.04 --> 3010.04
um

3020.94 --> 3024.9
right

3022.98 --> 3026.64
anyway

3024.9 --> 3030.0
yeah if they seem a little grouchy it's

3026.64 --> 3033.74
because I haven't had any smoke cannabis

3030.0 --> 3033.74

[Music]

3046.02 --> 3049.02
foreign

3052.619 --> 3055.619
legally

3056.0 --> 3060.38
allowed to give Financial advice

3061.579 --> 3067.1600000000003
dude I don't know how that works I do

3064.74 --> 3067.16
not know

3069.66 --> 3074.22
I don't know if it would be illegal I

3071.94 --> 3076.859
mean is it illegal to just share

3074.22 --> 3079.9399999999996
information and be paid for that

3076.859 --> 3079.94
does it matter

3080.46 --> 3085.26
I don't think you need any

3082.38 --> 3087.2400000000002
qualifications to give advice

3085.26 --> 3089.7000000000003
it's just that if you have

3087.24 --> 3093.359
qualifications then people tend to trust

3089.7 --> 3094.9199999999996
you based on that which can be a huge

3093.359 --> 3096.48
mistake

3094.92 --> 3097.98
because just because you have some

3096.48 --> 3100.7400000000002
papers doesn't mean that you're actually

3097.98 --> 3102.18
going to give legitimate advice

3100.74 --> 3104.7599999999998
so

3102.18 --> 3106.98
I don't know man

3104.76 --> 3109.1400000000003
depends on where you get your info from

3106.98 --> 3110.819
no no it doesn't why the hell would it

3109.14 --> 3113.5789999999997
depend where you get the info from

3110.819 --> 3115.88
whether you're allowed to do it unless

3113.579 --> 3119.4
you're literally like giving inside

3115.88 --> 3121.8
trading heads up of stock market which

3119.4 --> 3125.3
is illegal right that is illegal if you

3121.8 --> 3125.3
have pre-knowledge about things

what the [ __ ] are you talking about

3129.42 --> 3132.38
copyright

3136.859 --> 3143.48
how does giving advice fall under

3139.619 --> 3143.48
copyright that's ridiculous

3152.88 --> 3157.38
yeah me neither Supreme no it's [ __ ] I

3156.059 --> 3160.5
don't like Jared I didn't like nothing

3157.38 --> 3162.9
about him I've tolerated him for a while

3160.5 --> 3164.819
because he seemed like oh it's a fellow

3162.9 --> 3168.3
flat earther but then he just started to

3164.819 --> 3171.0
go full Savage and call Nathan a scammer

3168.3 --> 3172.619
and then I realized no he was always a

3171.0 --> 3175.8
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3172.619 --> 3180.319
and super shady and it will never take

3175.8 --> 3180.319
any advice from him ever about anything

3180.78 --> 3183.8
because he's trash

3184.98 --> 3188.48
morally deranged

3193.319 --> 3198.359
he's a morally deranged person who

3195.48 --> 3200.819
thinks he's a good guy

3198.359 --> 3202.859
and then if you test him on it no you

3200.819 --> 3206.599
don't care I'll do what he want yeah

3202.859 --> 3206.5989999999997
because he's morally deranged

3233.4 --> 3237.96
I don't rule for Saint hubbins I don't

3235.859 --> 3240.119
know anything about it why don't you go

3237.96 --> 3242.46
and find out because you're not gonna

3240.119 --> 3244.92
find out by asking me

3242.46 --> 3247.02
I hope that's kind of obvious yeah

3244.92 --> 3249.359
that's why there's no point of bringing

3247.02 --> 3251.54
it up to me because how the hell would I

3249.359 --> 3251.54
know

3251.579 --> 3255.38
I don't even watch his shows

3269.52 --> 3273.839
if you

3271.16 --> 3276.48
present info

3273.839 --> 3278.7599999999998
from someone else's your own

3276.48 --> 3281.339
that all depends on that person I mean

3278.76 --> 3282.6800000000003
if the person is gonna call copyright if

3281.339 --> 3285.42
he actually had that information

3282.68 --> 3287.22
copyrighted yeah then

3285.42 --> 3289.7400000000002
then he couldn't get into trouble over

3287.22 --> 3293.66
that I don't know man I don't freaking

3289.74 --> 3293.66
know why you keep asking me

3294.18 --> 3298.339
why are you assuming that I would know

3310.44 --> 3315.2400000000002
using fpd arguments yeah except those

3313.079 --> 3318.02
that he doesn't like like about the

3315.24 --> 3318.02
scientific method

3319.5 --> 3323.94
right

3321.48 --> 3326.22
but I don't think Nathan really cares I

3323.94 --> 3329.2400000000002
mean that's the entire point that the

3326.22 --> 3329.24
arguments do spread

3342.74 --> 3350.72
yeah Rufus you're you're out of here

3347.099 --> 3350.7200000000003
you're [ __ ] out of here man

3351.78 --> 3357.3590000000004
yeah don't talk about [ __ ] geronism I

3354.9 --> 3360.7200000000003
don't care about [ __ ] geronism if he

3514.92 --> 3518.819
don't want them

3516.96 --> 3522.0
to be a subject

3518.819 --> 3526.16
unless it's really fresh

3522.0 --> 3526.16
just did something stupid or something

3622.38 --> 3629.2200000000003
guess what I don't bring him up I don't

3625.98 --> 3631.92
talk about it why because it's dumb and

3629.22 --> 3634.2599999999998
if you look into it that dumb might rub

3631.92 --> 3637.5
off on you that's why I don't bring it

3634.26 --> 3639.2990000000004

opportunity to make themselves more

there

3658.46 --> 3662.48
all right anyway

3675.5 --> 3682.319
all right so if you agree with me

3678.299 --> 3685.5
and you too would like to maintain

3682.319 --> 3688.44
watching this channel

3685.5 --> 3691.2
listening to what I got to say

3688.44 --> 3693.059
because I guarantee you're not gonna be

3691.2 --> 3695.9399999999996
Dumber for it

3693.059 --> 3698.3390000000004
might be a little bit boring at times

3695.94 --> 3700.5
because I don't continually talk I don't

3698.339 --> 3702.299
have an entire subject for two hours

3700.5 --> 3704.52
that I ramble on about continually

3702.299 --> 3707.339
typically

3704.52 --> 3709.859
only partially well if you can stand

3707.339 --> 3711.96
that I guarantee you watching my shows

3709.859 --> 3715.92
will not make you dumber

3711.96 --> 3717.96
guarantee it yeah actual guarantee

3715.92 --> 3721.94
you can literally test that on yourself

3717.96 --> 3721.94
if you want to with some IQ tests

3722.46 --> 3726.54
swear if you follow my show you keep

3724.74 --> 3730.9799999999996
watching

3726.54 --> 3733.68
you will become less dumb I swear it I

3730.98 --> 3736.68
swear it it's true

3733.68 --> 3739.859
why because I need it

3736.68 --> 3743.04
I do this because I need smart people

3739.859 --> 3746.339
because if they don't if I don't have

3743.04 --> 3750.839
smart people around me I want to die

3746.339 --> 3753.599
because I can't stand chronic stupidity

3750.839 --> 3757.7
so everything I do is to make people

3753.599 --> 3757.7000000000003
smarter in some way

3764.94 --> 3768.7200000000003
how's the book you've been reading

3766.799 --> 3773.24
anything it Oh you mean from

3768.72 --> 3773.24
rodelsteiner I haven't continued further

3774.059 --> 3777.48
thank you

3775.02 --> 3779.24
not today

3777.48 --> 3783.619
too grouchy

3779.24 --> 3783.6189999999997
but I will I will keep you updated

3799.38 --> 3802.1600000000003
that's right

3807.24 --> 3812.54
yeah it does platform also keeps us

3809.7 --> 3812.54
together that's right

3814.859 --> 3820.0789999999997
but yeah I mean

3817.319 --> 3822.599
can you feed the hosts

3820.079 --> 3824.2200000000003
it's nice you're coming together on the

3822.599 --> 3827.88
island but I'm not gonna push it you

3824.22 --> 3829.859
guys know that I'm sorry man

3827.88 --> 3832.46
am I smarter than most of the people I

3829.859 --> 3832.46
associate with

3835.38 --> 3838.4
well what do you mean

3845.04 --> 3850.4
no

3846.96 --> 3850.4
now typically no

3850.44 --> 3854.88
because if I were like a lot smarter

3853.14 --> 3857.52
than them then there would be literally

3854.88 --> 3859.5
nothing I could talk to them about

3857.52 --> 3861.96
and this just not pleasant hang around

3859.5 --> 3864.18
that so no I'll tip I typically hang

3861.96 --> 3867.7200000000003
around smarter people that's why I like

3864.18 --> 3870.0
to hang around with the FED crowd

3867.72 --> 3873.02
and Nathan is freaking smart

3870.0 --> 3875.96
Adam meekin is freaking smart Brian

3873.02 --> 3882.2
Brian's logic is freaking smart

3875.96 --> 3885.18
QE is although intenable freaking smart

3882.2 --> 3888.359
it's just these emotions like ruin it

3885.18 --> 3891.2599999999998
sometimes right but yeah

3888.359 --> 3894.66
I wouldn't know if I'm smarter than them

3891.26 --> 3896.2200000000003
it again that's like what kind of smarts

3894.66 --> 3898.74
right it talked about this before like

3896.22 --> 3901.3799999999997
how are they smart

3898.74 --> 3904.02
they have their own Peak smarts and then

3901.38 --> 3907.559
they have like weaker sides everyone

3904.02 --> 3909.839
does everybody that is smart has Peak

3907.559 --> 3913.02
capability Peak Talent

3909.839 --> 3916.44
with their smarts and then weaknesses

3913.02 --> 3919.079
with those smarts always

3916.44 --> 3922.079
that's how it works

3919.079 --> 3924.78
so yeah all of the guys out like from

3922.079 --> 3928.98
fvd they have smarts

3924.78 --> 3930.079
that surpass mine in that respective

3928.98 --> 3935.099
Direction

3930.079 --> 3939.059
however I have my own specialty

3935.099 --> 3943.02
which is mostly oriented psychologically

3939.059 --> 3946.2000000000003
and analytically like psychoanalytically

3943.02 --> 3948.299
I can read spiritual metadata I can

3946.2 --> 3950.8799999999997
literally derive a whole bunch of

3948.299 --> 3953.46
information very early on before other

3950.88 --> 3956.579
people could even dream to figure out

3953.46 --> 3959.46
what the other person is thinking

3956.579 --> 3962.28
that is my specialty and in that they do

3959.46 --> 3965.819
not surpass me

3962.28 --> 3968.46
even though I've trained them to because

3965.819 --> 3970.859
of my presence and the way I analyze

3968.46 --> 3973.68
I've helped them get a better Insight

3970.859 --> 3976.2
but I'm still very much the master of

3973.68 --> 3979.14
that very much so

3976.2 --> 3981.6189999999997
they do not surpass me with that

3979.14 --> 3981.6189999999997
anyway

3981.72 --> 3988.2
check my PayPal oh yes flatter Sage oh

3985.619 --> 3991.28
yes I will

3988.2 --> 3991.2799999999997
oh man

3997.38 --> 4003.819
thank you

4000.2 --> 4003.819
I really needed that

4007.7 --> 4011.4399999999996
that is extremely helpful

4014.78 --> 4018.6400000000003
thank you so much flatter Sage

4019.339 --> 4022.52
or somewhere do you think the FED chat

4021.559 --> 4024.619
is

4022.52 --> 4026.0
well smarter than the average YouTube

4024.619 --> 4030.079
chat

4026.0 --> 4032.24
if I compare it to other active streams

4030.079 --> 4033.44
where I think that they're smart people

4032.24 --> 4035.7799999999997
yeah

4033.44 --> 4039.14
I mean the people in a chat learn a lot

4035.78 --> 4041.7200000000003
of tricks through fpd

4039.14 --> 4044.96
but they're mostly well copying

4041.72 --> 4047.5389999999998
attitudes and tricks and stances They're

4044.96 --> 4049.2200000000003
copying most of the time but they do so

4047.539 --> 4053.1800000000003
very well

4049.22 --> 4055.0989999999997
so yeah I think that the chat at FTD is

4053.18 --> 4057.68
on average pretty smart dude I think

4055.099 --> 4060.8590000000004
that the chat

4057.68 --> 4062.359
in my show is pretty smart that is the

4060.859 --> 4064.5789999999997
people yeah the people that aren't

4062.359 --> 4067.0389999999998
trolls or

4064.579 --> 4069.28
yeah so I think you guys are pretty

4067.039 --> 4069.28
smart

4069.319 --> 4075.2599999999998
you have all you have your own

4072.38 --> 4078.579
Peak Talent directions

4075.26 --> 4078.579
separate from each other

4095.839 --> 4098.44
important

4100.06 --> 4104.179
all right you already said excluding

4102.38 --> 4106.6
trolls right now I think this chart is

4104.179 --> 4106.6
pretty smart

4108.759 --> 4114.56
at least all of you are like capable

4112.219 --> 4116.12
communicators at least you can talk like

4114.56 --> 4119.779
normal people

4116.12 --> 4122.0599999999995
because those that can't I get into a

4119.779 --> 4123.92
hassle with very quickly and then I kick

4122.06 --> 4126.339000000001
them out

4123.92 --> 4128.719
because if you just cannot

4126.339 --> 4132.3189999999995
normally speak

4128.719 --> 4136.1
like comprehensible

4132.319 --> 4139.660000000001
and clearly then I'll start getting

4136.1 --> 4139.660000000001
really agitated about you

4143.54 --> 4148.5199999999995
right even if you're like really

4145.64 --> 4151.38
positive like moral wise or whatever it

4148.52 --> 4153.52
still annoys me

4151.38 --> 4158.08
[Music]

4153.52 --> 4158.080000000001
that troll isn't smarter yeah no [ __ ]

4160.219 --> 4165.419
yeah all right

4162.31 --> 4165.419000000001
[Music]

4172.239 --> 4177.0199999999995
no but I I got some really enfiest dumb

4175.58 --> 4179.54
people

4177.02 --> 4183.02
right I mean it is a typical combination

4179.54 --> 4184.699
right I'm I'm pretty much a genius yeah

4183.02 --> 4187.400000000001
I'm saying it

4184.699 --> 4190.699
not that that makes me like societally

4187.4 --> 4191.96
successful but I am freaking intelligent

4190.699 --> 4195.5599999999995
spiritual

4191.96 --> 4199.28
especially spiritual but even just

4195.56 --> 4203.120000000001
regular intellectual yeah

4199.28 --> 4204.44
not the best out there I'm sure but I am

4203.12 --> 4208.34
freaking smart

4204.44 --> 4211.04
and I am a spiritual genius I know [ __ ]

4208.34 --> 4215.1990000000005
I can see [ __ ] I've experienced a whole

4211.04 --> 4215.199
bunch and I mastered that

4215.54 --> 4222.32
our most abandoned

4217.82 --> 4224.9
or get lost or get possessed

4222.32 --> 4227.0599999999995
right

4224.9 --> 4230.42
foreign

4227.06 --> 4234.02
but I am freaking smart I know I am and

4230.42 --> 4237.32
so it's very logical that really [ __ ]

4234.02 --> 4240.8
dumb deranged people

4237.32 --> 4244.219
that do have a pretty good income feel

4240.8 --> 4246.9800000000005
really dissatisfied with my presence

4244.219 --> 4249.62
because I'm smarter than them and they

4246.98 --> 4253.459999999999
can feel it it hurts but they have more

4249.62 --> 4257.0599999999995
money and because of my existence

4253.46 --> 4258.9800000000005
they feel hurt because they realize that

4257.06 --> 4262.159000000001
they are not smarter because of their

4258.98 --> 4262.159
money provably

4263.3 --> 4267.679
because a lot of dumb people that have

4265.64 --> 4268.9400000000005
money think they're really smart because

4267.679 --> 4271.34
they have money

4268.94 --> 4273.919999999999
but then when they actually face real

4271.34 --> 4275.900000000001
intelligence it hurts because now

4273.92 --> 4279.08
suddenly it doesn't work anymore that

4275.9 --> 4282.739
illusion of self-imposed intelligence

4279.08 --> 4285.5599999999995
that you do it doesn't work anymore when

4282.739 --> 4288.44
you actually face real intelligence yeah

4285.56 --> 4291.5
now it just makes you feel dumb which

4288.44 --> 4294.86
you are and so you're gonna come here

4291.5 --> 4297.26
and try to put me down like that because

4294.86 --> 4300.62
it hurts I hurt you

4297.26 --> 4302.6
I'm trying to hurt you because you're a

4300.62 --> 4305.0599999999995
[ __ ] [ __ ] and you have a lot of

4302.6 --> 4306.7390000000005
money that you don't even deserve

4305.06 --> 4309.860000000001
yeah you don't deserve that money

4306.739 --> 4313.159
because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

4309.86 --> 4315.679
yeah it was given to you

4313.159 --> 4317.54
because you were harmless enough because

4315.679 --> 4321.56
you're a [ __ ]

4317.54 --> 4324.14
yeah in this world you get a lot of

4321.56 --> 4326.42
money because you're [ __ ] and think

4324.14 --> 4329.84
you're smart

4326.42 --> 4333.08
because that's safe and it helps it

4329.84 --> 4337.159000000001
helps the even richer more evil ones

4333.08 --> 4340.699
how by making more people [ __ ]

4337.159 --> 4343.099999999999
how because people will watch a person

4340.699 --> 4346.879999999999
that is [ __ ] but makes a lot of

4343.1 --> 4349.9400000000005
money and then want to be like that and

4346.88 --> 4352.28
they're gonna mimic their ways including

4349.94 --> 4355.58
the retardation because well they're

4352.28 --> 4359.719
rich right they're rich so that has to

4355.58 --> 4362.12
be the way to go yeah the way to go is

4359.719 --> 4365.06
becoming [ __ ] like everybody else

4362.12 --> 4367.5199999999995
and getting more [ __ ] and then then

4365.06 --> 4371.4800000000005
you might get rich too yeah yeah that's

4367.52 --> 4373.6990000000005
why [ __ ] retards get promoted like

4371.48 --> 4377.36
crazy they get

4373.699 --> 4378.98
the hundreds of thousands of dollars in

4377.36 --> 4381.98
euros

4378.98 --> 4384.139999999999
because they're [ __ ] and they don't

4381.98 --> 4386.54
realize it

4384.14 --> 4388.64
they think they're smart so they like to

4386.54 --> 4391.219
shove those people

4388.64 --> 4393.679
top-notch right in front of as many

4391.219 --> 4396.02
people as possible so they will see you

4393.679 --> 4399.5
like wow are you successful wow I'm

4396.02 --> 4400.9400000000005
gonna I can be successful too all I have

4399.5 --> 4406.4
to do is just

4400.94 --> 4409.28
do the things that he does right yeah

4406.4 --> 4412.4
and that's why [ __ ] retards get

4409.28 --> 4415.48
promoted to front seat front row seat

4412.4 --> 4415.48
in media world

4423.52 --> 4429.6990000000005
these trolls didn't have money

4426.32 --> 4429.699
no some of them do

4440.96 --> 4446.06
a lot of them do

4443.659 --> 4447.98
you'd be surprised

4446.06 --> 4449.3
you think oh that's just poor people

4447.98 --> 4451.339999999999
doing that they have nothing better to

4449.3 --> 4452.900000000001
do with it no no no that's a lot of the

4451.34 --> 4455.84
times it's actually

4452.9 --> 4458.54
like rich kids

4455.84 --> 4460.400000000001
people that feel kind of Trapped in

4458.54 --> 4462.62
their life but they're still wealthy and

4460.4 --> 4465.0199999999995
then their egos constantly in turmoil

4462.62 --> 4465.98
because of that so they're gonna seek

4465.02 --> 4469.9400000000005
out

4465.98 --> 4471.919999999999
poor people and Bully them

4469.94 --> 4474.199
that's what they do

4471.92 --> 4477.9800000000005
so a lot of them are rich kids like

4474.199 --> 4481.178999999999
World economic Forum kids

4477.98 --> 4481.178999999999
that type of thing

4483.98 --> 4488.78
right or Stooges right it could be

4486.26 --> 4491.179
little retards that really have no life

4488.78 --> 4492.4
nobody gives a [ __ ] about that they the

4491.179 --> 4495.02
world economic foreign people

4492.4 --> 4497.599999999999
specifically befriend

4495.02 --> 4499.159000000001
so they can be that amazing Rich friend

4497.6 --> 4501.620000000001
that they all look up to and they might

4499.159 --> 4505.339999999999
even get some scraps and then those

4501.62 --> 4510.44
retards will defend that rich person

4505.34 --> 4512.84
even bully others for them right

4510.44 --> 4516.199
they'll just point like oh yeah you just

4512.84 --> 4519.76
go and troll those guys

4516.199 --> 4519.759999999999
and I'll give you some scraps

attacking everybody that comes in my

4684.86 --> 4688.639999999999
chat

4686.12 --> 4689.599999999999
that isn't directly acting like an

4688.64 --> 4691.58
[ __ ]

4689.6 --> 4695.38
have you ever considered just not

4691.58 --> 4695.38
attacking people straight out

4697.76 --> 4702.860000000001
it's very immature of you to do that

4700.4 --> 4705.62
Derek

4702.86 --> 4708.4
yeah you have to wait until they start

4705.62 --> 4711.38
acting like asses before you do that

4708.4 --> 4713.83
otherwise you're literally the one to be

4711.38 --> 4716.97
acting like an ass

4713.83 --> 4716.97
[Music]

4718.1 --> 4721.900000000001
oh

4720.47 --> 4725.84
[Music]

4721.9 --> 4728.299999999999
yeah and you don't get to say who should

4725.84 --> 4729.6
be here or not I get to say that you

4728.3 --> 4733.27
understand

4729.6 --> 4733.27
[Music]

4746.42 --> 4749.42
yep

4753.739 --> 4758.239
thank you

4755.739 --> 4760.0599999999995
yeah don't thank me just yet this is

4758.239 --> 4763.239
just common decency I'm trying to

4760.06 --> 4763.2390000000005
reinforce here

4763.76 --> 4768.4400000000005
I don't care turret I don't care

4766.58 --> 4771.14
he's there with his official account

4768.44 --> 4774.139999999999
he's not acting like an [ __ ] since

4771.14 --> 4776.12
his first appearance here as his actual

4774.14 --> 4778.159000000001
account you shouldn't talk to him like

4776.12 --> 4781.76
that

4778.159 --> 4783.92
if fight the Flat Earth came in here you

4781.76 --> 4785.900000000001
shouldn't talk to him like that if Simon

4783.92 --> 4786.7390000000005
Dan came in here you shouldn't talk like

4785.9 --> 4789.08
that

4786.739 --> 4790.4
now if it was Mr sensible yeah then you

4789.08 --> 4792.98
could do whatever the [ __ ] you want

4790.4 --> 4796.339999999999
because I I think he's absolutely

4792.98 --> 4798.799999999999
repulsive beyond comprehension

4796.34 --> 4800.42
but that's pretty much the exception I

4798.8 --> 4802.88
don't want you to treat people like that

4800.42 --> 4805.159
that come in my chat

4802.88 --> 4807.58
he's here with his actual account don't

4805.159 --> 4807.58
do that

4815.179 --> 4820.6990000000005
I don't care I don't care what you think

4817.88 --> 4823.46
they were Derek I don't care you

4820.699 --> 4825.98
understand I don't care if you think

4823.46 --> 4828.199
that Blue Marble science was the troll

4825.98 --> 4830.419999999999
account from before you have no evidence

4828.199 --> 4833.839999999999
for that he's not talking in the same

4830.42 --> 4836.96
way you shouldn't treat him like that

4833.84 --> 4839.900000000001
because you have a far-fetched jump to

4836.96 --> 4841.94
conclusion about it yeah stop being rash

4839.9 --> 4843.5599999999995
and stop being hostile to people that

4841.94 --> 4846.94
enter my chat

4843.56 --> 4846.9400000000005
it's getting on my nerves

4858.98 --> 4863.178999999999
too much hatred on both ads must be

4860.9 --> 4867.099999999999
tarot he's just a hot head but it needs

4863.179 --> 4867.1
to get a lid on that seriously

4867.14 --> 4873.320000000001
you gotta hold it back man

4870.02 --> 4876.320000000001
yeah you go and explode on people after

4873.32 --> 4880.159
they start acting like asses okay don't

4876.32 --> 4883.599999999999
preempt that it just makes you look like

4880.159 --> 4883.599999999999
an [ __ ] Derrick

4888.81 --> 4892.02
[Music]

4900.199 --> 4904.78
sorry I think between ethics and morals

4907.46 --> 4913.2390000000005
well ethics is much more

4910.4 --> 4913.239
uh

4913.94 --> 4920.96
ethics is more of a legal system in a

4917.12 --> 4922.76
way while morals are more cultural based

4920.96 --> 4925.159
and intuitive

4922.76 --> 4928.3
that's what I would say right ethics are

4925.159 --> 4931.94
written are they're written

4928.3 --> 4935.3
conceptions that's ethics it's like a

4931.94 --> 4938.659
code you follow morals are more

4935.3 --> 4941.3
like yeah of course you do this right we

4938.659 --> 4943.82
all do this that's the way to do it like

4941.3 --> 4947.42
that's more about morality

4943.82 --> 4950.48
it's a more intuitive and feeling based

4947.42 --> 4954.1
our ethics are very much written

4950.48 --> 4954.099999999999
that's the big difference I'd say

4955.64 --> 4962.02
or a little more personal yeah yeah

4958.64 --> 4962.02
that's another way to say it

4962.06 --> 4969.76
just informing no no turret stop making

4965.239 --> 4969.759999999999
excuses for yourself don't do that

4969.8 --> 4975.7390000000005
don't do that yeah

4972.26 --> 4978.8
you said haha talk about loser no see

4975.739 --> 4983.0
blue yeah that's just being a dick

4978.8 --> 4986.4800000000005
don't make excuses you were a dick

4983.0 --> 4991.48
it's not informing you were a dick don't

4986.48 --> 4991.48
make excuses you were and you shouldn't

4993.44 --> 4998.12
and I know this is a a standing issue

4996.56 --> 5000.34
with you and I'm going to keep

4998.12 --> 5003.699
addressing it because it's not good for

5000.34 --> 5004.719
you it's not good for you tarot when you

5003.699 --> 5008.5
do that

5004.719 --> 5010.719
you make yourself look like a dick

5008.5 --> 5013.56
that is unpleasant

5010.719 --> 5013.56
don't do it

5014.14 --> 5018.76
hold back

5016.36 --> 5022.12
hold back after they start acting like

5018.76 --> 5024.58
[ __ ] okay that's the order

5022.12 --> 5028.14
that's the way you should do it in that

5024.58 --> 5028.14
order not preemptive

5030.34 --> 5036.64
I mean if it's like a noisy shouty chat

5033.52 --> 5038.8
where everybody's just yelling yeah I

5036.64 --> 5041.860000000001
get it you could do that nobody would

5038.8 --> 5045.159000000001
give a [ __ ] yeah this chat is not that

5041.86 --> 5048.219
type of chat this is a civil chat

5045.159 --> 5052.48
and people are going to be

5048.219 --> 5055.179
punished based on their behavior

5052.48 --> 5057.4
and that includes flat earthers

5055.179 --> 5060.36
so just

5057.4 --> 5060.36
get a hold of yourself

5062.24 --> 5065.3589999999995
[Music]

5076.239 --> 5080.62
I disagree with that that's not the

5078.28 --> 5084.82
that's not the Paradigm the Paradigm is

5080.62 --> 5087.76
about being completely written

5084.82 --> 5090.5199999999995
like ethics are there's books of Ethics

5087.76 --> 5093.280000000001
where it's written yeah there's no books

5090.52 --> 5096.280000000001
of morals books of morals are stories

5093.28 --> 5098.98
what are stories culture

5096.28 --> 5101.739
why do they appeal to people because of

5098.98 --> 5104.5599999999995
their internal feelings so I truly think

5101.739 --> 5106.959999999999
that morals are feeling based and

5104.56 --> 5110.280000000001
intuition culture

5106.96 --> 5114.52
and ethics are philosophy

5110.28 --> 5116.5599999999995
written detailed intellectual approach

5114.52 --> 5120.360000000001
right ethics

5116.56 --> 5120.360000000001
come from rationalism

5120.4 --> 5127.12
well morals come well

5123.159 --> 5129.4
from religion from spirituality

5127.12 --> 5131.58
from culture that's where morals come

5129.4 --> 5131.58
from

5135.699 --> 5137.94
right

5138.4 --> 5143.04
professional ethics in Fe

5141.04 --> 5143.04
bruary

5144.0 --> 5147.3
I don't know

5148.179 --> 5154.02
I mean it's just a part just a part of

5151.719 --> 5154.02
the show

5159.4 --> 5166.42
but maybe ethics versus morals or the

5163.06 --> 5168.400000000001
difference between ethics and morality

5166.42 --> 5171.219
but it's just yeah it might be a good

5168.4 --> 5174.46
time I guess I could do that

5171.219 --> 5179.159
Integrity cannot be legislated

5174.46 --> 5179.159
right because Integrity is moral based

5189.3 --> 5194.46
maybe both both morals and ethics

5196.0 --> 5199.78
but mostly morals I don't know it's

5198.219 --> 5209.08
complicated

5199.78 --> 5211.0599999999995
[Music]

5209.08 --> 5212.62
sorry it'll at least make an interesting

5211.06 --> 5215.080000000001
title

5212.62 --> 5217.599999999999
so yeah

5215.08 --> 5220.0199999999995
there you go difference between morals

5217.6 --> 5220.02
and ethics

5228.8 --> 5232.459
[Music]

5233.02 --> 5237.9400000000005
ethical behavior that is immoral

5234.94 --> 5240.339999999999
interesting very very interesting that

5237.94 --> 5245.259999999999
that even makes my case even more right

5240.34 --> 5246.84
because ethics is more in my view a

5245.26 --> 5249.6990000000005
written

5246.84 --> 5253.360000000001
law-based structure it's a philosophy

5249.699 --> 5255.58
that's written like laws like the laws

5253.36 --> 5259.42
of ethics

5255.58 --> 5262.659
ethical Behavior but laws

5259.42 --> 5264.9400000000005
don't have a spirit they're not

5262.659 --> 5267.46
right it's just written and you follow

5264.94 --> 5270.099999999999
the writing and however you fill it in

5267.46 --> 5272.199
with your feelings that is up to the

5270.1 --> 5274.900000000001
individual like a moral individual could

5272.199 --> 5279.4
use ethics and like be great

5274.9 --> 5282.159
be really good but an evil person could

5279.4 --> 5284.5
also take ethics and basically gravel

5282.159 --> 5286.839999999999
their way through find a little lawyer

5284.5 --> 5291.219
trick corners of interpretation still

5286.84 --> 5293.679
follow the ethics but obviously abuse

5291.219 --> 5295.12
any moral spirit that was behind it

5293.679 --> 5297.54
originally

5295.12 --> 5297.54
see

5317.56 --> 5323.139
okay thanks Jason Brown

5319.96 --> 5325.42
no no worries thank you for that

5323.139 --> 5328.12
right and I like tarot I really like him

5325.42 --> 5330.04
but it's been an issue before and it

5328.12 --> 5332.86
even kicked him out a couple of times

5330.04 --> 5335.26
because of it and he knows

5332.86 --> 5337.179
it's something he needs to work on

5335.26 --> 5341.08
probably the rest of his life because it

5337.179 --> 5342.52
is in it's like in him he is like that

5341.08 --> 5345.159
I mean

5342.52 --> 5347.620000000001
I should ask like how about the rest of

5345.159 --> 5349.36
your family I mean you probably have

5347.62 --> 5352.12
other siblings that are kind of like

5349.36 --> 5354.099999999999
that too right that are really like ah

5352.12 --> 5355.659
attack

5354.1 --> 5358.179
because

5355.659 --> 5360.4
that is not just a character that's

5358.179 --> 5362.58
usually like a family trait when you got

5360.4 --> 5362.58
it

5363.82 --> 5368.62
right but I do like turret so I don't

5367.0 --> 5371.58
want him to like

5368.62 --> 5371.58
not come back

5376.93 --> 5383.9400000000005
[Music]

5379.54 --> 5383.94
on Central prostitution interesting

5388.3 --> 5393.4800000000005
thank you devil staff again that's a

5390.28 --> 5393.48
very insightful comment

5403.659 --> 5405.839999999999
foreign

5407.28 --> 5411.9
face to face as over the internet

5420.1 --> 5424.4800000000005
you're the opposite in real life

5422.32 --> 5426.699
okay

5424.48 --> 5429.459999999999
hmm

5426.699 --> 5431.799999999999
okay so you're kind of like an introvert

5429.46 --> 5435.28
then that's basically using the internet

5431.8 --> 5436.78
to venture frustrations

5435.28 --> 5439.239
okay

5436.78 --> 5442.0
effectively you could say that I'm like

5439.239 --> 5444.218999999999
that too I mean I'm a lot more

5442.0 --> 5447.219
hot-headed here on the internet than I

5444.219 --> 5449.679
am in real life in real life I am like

5447.219 --> 5454.56
the most patient

5449.679 --> 5456.9400000000005
calm smooth guy you ever meet

5454.56 --> 5459.34
I really am

5456.94 --> 5461.98
like people can get really rude and

5459.34 --> 5465.659000000001
outrageous to me and I'll like not do

5461.98 --> 5467.32
anything I like literally just like

5465.659 --> 5470.08
okay

5467.32 --> 5472.38
let's let's turn this into a productive

5470.08 --> 5472.38
Direction

5472.96 --> 5476.4
bottle of angry yeah yeah

5480.88 --> 5486.54
so bottle up frustration I mean

5482.679 --> 5486.54
frustration with the world stats morets

5487.48 --> 5492.638999999999
I get it I mean India's seen a whole

5491.08 --> 5494.88
bunch of [ __ ]

5492.639 --> 5497.679
with the whole

5494.88 --> 5502.0
medical experimentation terrible

5497.679 --> 5505.139
situation there so yeah he's frustrated

5502.0 --> 5505.139
it's very understandable

5508.239 --> 5512.32
Lawrence I don't have much of at all

5510.1 --> 5515.26
yeah clap rockers well that's why

5512.32 --> 5518.5199999999995
there's a hashtag intolerance in my uh

5515.26 --> 5518.52
description boxes

5524.98 --> 5528.94
because I think that tolerance is

5526.9 --> 5531.36
actually

5528.94 --> 5534.219
a

5531.36 --> 5537.639
Marxist construct

5534.219 --> 5540.699
probably the most subtle

5537.639 --> 5543.46
foundational form of it because it's

5540.699 --> 5545.678999999999
like yeah of course of course

5543.46 --> 5547.54
tolerance that only makes sense right

5545.679 --> 5550.54
you need to keep the peace yeah yeah

5547.54 --> 5552.639
yeah but on the long run

5550.54 --> 5555.5199999999995
especially if everybody sticks to that

5552.639 --> 5558.84
it's horrific because people grow out of

5555.52 --> 5558.84
control because of Tolerance

5561.46 --> 5566.8
is like an act oh no I am like this it's

5564.82 --> 5568.96
just that I never really do it face to

5566.8 --> 5571.320000000001
face because that's really off-putting

5568.96 --> 5571.32
to people

5578.4 --> 5584.44
unless they really like that sort of

5581.139 --> 5588.46
thing unless that like I think that like

5584.44 --> 5590.919999999999
more Spanish people types

5588.46 --> 5593.32
because they get a little bit more movie

5590.92 --> 5596.1990000000005
and loud and all that they do kind of

5593.32 --> 5600.219
appreciate when I am like that

5596.199 --> 5601.0599999999995
but Dutch typical Dutch people not so

5600.219 --> 5604.84
much

5601.06 --> 5609.120000000001
they think it's just like too noisy

5604.84 --> 5609.12
throw an act got it what

5609.9 --> 5616.659
I'm just being myself though

5614.199 --> 5619.299999999999
you could it's more logical to say that

5616.659 --> 5620.32
me keeping really calm out there is the

5619.3 --> 5622.96
act

5620.32 --> 5625.299999999999
right because the Expressions that I

5622.96 --> 5628.2390000000005
give are all natural this is how I am

5625.3 --> 5630.639
this is how I feel this is how I think

5628.239 --> 5634.44
so in that sense not an act

5630.639 --> 5634.4400000000005
it's a different attitude

5634.719 --> 5639.76
I'm not being stoic because there's no

5637.06 --> 5643.56
point in being stoic on camera for like

5639.76 --> 5643.56
two hours it's boring as [ __ ]

5648.1 --> 5652.84
that's your very direct yeah yeah I

5650.5 --> 5654.219
agree a lot of them are and they are

5652.84 --> 5656.56
crushers

5654.219 --> 5659.1
I really like when Dutch people get

5656.56 --> 5659.1
super Direct

5661.12 --> 5665.04
I try to be very direct myself

5674.699 --> 5682.0599999999995
yeah so Kevlar

5678.4 --> 5684.638999999999
can you correct yourself there yeah

5682.06 --> 5687.54
this is the real me the way I am out

5684.639 --> 5687.54
there is the act

5687.58 --> 5691.84
because they can't handle face to face

5689.86 --> 5695.139
real me

5691.84 --> 5699.54
people would get agitated uncomfortable

5695.139 --> 5699.54
very quickly and want to go away

5703.12 --> 5705.3
thank you

5705.94 --> 5711.28
right for me socializing out there is

5709.12 --> 5713.8
just bearing with it it's just like how

5711.28 --> 5716.679
for how long can I tolerate how [ __ ]

5713.8 --> 5719.320000000001
everybody is that's the way I act out

5716.679 --> 5721.6
there okay

5719.32 --> 5724.96
this is not an act

5721.6 --> 5728.38
my stoic appearance in the real world

5724.96 --> 5731.44
face-to-face situation that is the act

5728.38 --> 5734.219
get it can I have a correction from you

5731.44 --> 5734.219
Kevlar

5739.659 --> 5745.42
I feel like I need to be someone else

5741.76 --> 5748.659000000001
yeah because people can't handle me

5745.42 --> 5751.4800000000005
it makes me unpopular if I just go out

5748.659 --> 5754.0599999999995
and be like this all the time

5751.48 --> 5756.218999999999
I have in the past guess what that

5754.06 --> 5758.46
happened yeah they didn't like me

5756.219 --> 5758.46
anymore

5761.739 --> 5764.919999999999
I tried it out and then I just know

5763.9 --> 5767.379999999999
people

5764.92 --> 5770.1990000000005
from people's facial expressions that

5767.38 --> 5772.84
they're basically just enduring me and

5770.199 --> 5774.28
then I know ah yeah it didn't work they

5772.84 --> 5775.4800000000005
don't like me they don't like who I

5774.28 --> 5777.699
really am

5775.48 --> 5780.5199999999995
that's acting

5777.699 --> 5782.5599999999995
do do you have a point Kevlar you have a

5780.52 --> 5785.26
point perhaps

5782.56 --> 5787.780000000001
never show up here

5785.26 --> 5790.62
now you're telling me I'm acting so what

need to be someone else no

5827.739 --> 5830.218999999999
never

5831.06 --> 5838.179
might suppress traits of mine

5835.54 --> 5840.04
inquiry typical inquiries of mine in

5838.179 --> 5844.3
face-to-face situations because I think

5840.04 --> 5846.46
that people will find it burdensome

5844.3 --> 5850.06
yeah I don't act

5846.46 --> 5852.04
like another person because I don't want

5850.06 --> 5854.4400000000005
to be myself oh no I want to be myself

5852.04 --> 5856.239
all right it's just that other people

5854.44 --> 5859.138999999999
don't really want that

5856.239 --> 5859.138999999999

person I'm simply suppressing traits

5871.0 --> 5877.36
I don't like take another attitude yeah

5874.3 --> 5880.06
I don't like oh oh I'm now

5877.36 --> 5883.719
like I'm going to act like I'm sort of a

5880.06 --> 5887.7390000000005
gay guy or something never ever okay

5883.719 --> 5891.04
never I don't act like somebody else

5887.739 --> 5894.959999999999
I act like me it's just how much of me

5891.04 --> 5894.96
are you gonna see that is all

5900.4 --> 5905.92
that's not acting

5903.58 --> 5908.739
it's called holding back yeah holding

5905.92 --> 5911.139
back is not acting acting is

5908.739 --> 5915.36
constructing another

5911.139 --> 5915.36
person another personality

5915.58 --> 5921.639
and then doing that that's not what I'm

5917.98 --> 5926.259999999999
doing this is me this is how I am

5921.639 --> 5929.139
loud direct easily offended intolerant

5926.26 --> 5930.34
very careful though and caring for

5929.139 --> 5934.0
people

5930.34 --> 5937.139
easily emotionally attached to things

5934.0 --> 5937.139
swept off my feet

5938.739 --> 5942.36
that's who I am

5943.3 --> 5946.679
not acting

5948.1 --> 5956.219
have I ever read a poem no

5951.94 --> 5956.219
yeah if I do a Golem that's acting

5962.08 --> 5966.639
because what I do when I act like Gala

5964.179 --> 5969.88
means I take a certain set of character

5966.639 --> 5972.88
traits that are a part of me in a

5969.88 --> 5975.34
certain side of me

5972.88 --> 5977.679
that I don't give a lot of priority but

5975.34 --> 5980.56
I have experienced that in the past that

5977.679 --> 5981.82
I then isolate I isolate that specific

5980.56 --> 5983.4400000000005
behavior

5981.82 --> 5987.34
and then

5983.44 --> 5991.54
act like that is my entire self that is

5987.34 --> 5993.6990000000005
acting yeah me holding back how loud I

5991.54 --> 5998.04
am or how direct I am that's not acting

5993.699 --> 5998.04
that's called holding back not acting

5998.16 --> 6002.219
[Music]

5999.42 --> 6004.92
and a great Luke Skywalker

6002.219 --> 6007.32
well not that great

6004.92 --> 6009.659
I mean I just know those particular

6007.32 --> 6011.96
scenes by heart I have an extremely

6009.659 --> 6015.659
detailed phonetic memory like a parrot

6011.96 --> 6017.699
and certain things I can just the sound

6015.659 --> 6021.0599999999995
of it I can perfectly emulate it because

6017.699 --> 6024.419999999999
I just remember the full details of it

6021.06 --> 6027.84
so when Luke skywig Walker says to Darth

6024.42 --> 6029.219
Vader no that's not true that's

6027.84 --> 6033.2390000000005
impossible

6029.219 --> 6036.42
I know exactly how that sounds and I can

6033.239 --> 6039.78
repeat that verbatim like a recorder

6036.42 --> 6043.1
because I have memory for sound like

6039.78 --> 6043.099999999999
that like a parrot

6046.26 --> 6053.400000000001
doesn't make me a great Luke Skywalker

6049.44 --> 6057.0599999999995
it's just certain iconic ways of how

6053.4 --> 6061.44
things were said the tone of it

6057.06 --> 6063.3
I can emulate that very accurately

6061.44 --> 6069.5689999999995
if I care about it

6063.3 --> 6069.569
[Music]

6073.88 --> 6079.400000000001
Amanda you where is he she there's a

6077.34 --> 6079.400000000001
menu

6081.06 --> 6085.56
oh there I missed you hello Amanda young

6083.699 --> 6089.12
good to see you

6085.56 --> 6089.120000000001
man time has been flying

6099.26 --> 6102.399
[Music]

6106.1 --> 6114.2390000000005
I can also do a really good Yoda laugh

6110.28 --> 6117.54
but don't they feel like doing it

6114.239 --> 6119.879999999999
because I love it like in Star Wars 2

6117.54 --> 6122.06
when he gets all when he's still kind of

6119.88 --> 6124.619
in his silly mode

6122.06 --> 6126.84
that that like

6124.619 --> 6130.44
that is really funny to me

6126.84 --> 6132.659000000001
like he was genuinely silly and funny

6130.44 --> 6135.239
before he basically came out that he was

6132.659 --> 6136.799999999999
Yoda

6135.239 --> 6138.718999999999
um

6136.8 --> 6140.219
we had a really funny way of giggling

6138.719 --> 6142.619
and laughing

6140.219 --> 6145.56
you never hear that after that by the

6142.619 --> 6147.739
way so that was Yoda acting like he was

6145.56 --> 6150.119000000001
a silly little creature

6147.739 --> 6152.599999999999
but it was funny

6150.119 --> 6152.599999999999
anyway

6158.58 --> 6163.94
do you think of Seagulls I don't know

6161.1 --> 6163.9400000000005
what you're talking about

6192.119 --> 6197.46
I don't no I have no idea what you're

6195.179 --> 6200.84
talking about making you think of

6197.46 --> 6200.84
Seagulls what

6200.94 --> 6206.839999999999
what does that have to do with anything

6202.8 --> 6206.84
you said before that point

6208.199 --> 6213.08
parody of Star Wars oh okay

6213.36 --> 6217.92
uh

6215.52 --> 6219.92
oh goody

6217.92 --> 6219.92
okay

6235.199 --> 6237.919999999999
what

6245.82 --> 6252.599999999999
right oh there's a lot of silly things

6249.719 --> 6257.82
that we end up knowing by heart I mean I

6252.6 --> 6260.34
know a video that I watched in like 2008

6257.82 --> 6263.34
called Mario the hardest level by heart

6260.34 --> 6265.56
where some weirdo guy who sounds like he

6263.34 --> 6268.32
could be like an Asian American or

6265.56 --> 6269.52
something is playing like a ridiculously

6268.32 --> 6271.679
tough

6269.52 --> 6275.76
Mario level

6271.679 --> 6278.34
and like gets re he gets so out of his

6275.76 --> 6279.900000000001
mind pissed off at it and he makes a

6278.34 --> 6281.88
whole bunch of really silly remarks

6279.9 --> 6284.638999999999
about it too but it's hilarious I

6281.88 --> 6286.4400000000005
watched that video like 50 times or

6284.639 --> 6288.659000000001
something together with a friend of mine

6286.44 --> 6291.36
who also thought it was hilarious and I

6288.659 --> 6294.299999999999
just like I catch myself every now and

6291.36 --> 6297.299999999999
then literally quoting that video

6294.3 --> 6300.900000000001
without telling anybody

6297.3 --> 6303.7390000000005
but I just used his voice of how he said

6300.9 --> 6306.719
it in that video that nobody knows

6303.739 --> 6309.959999999999
I do that regularly actually because

6306.719 --> 6313.38
that video was like one of the funniest

6309.96 --> 6314.699
YouTube videos I had ever seen first on

6313.38 --> 6318.2390000000005
the internet

6314.699 --> 6321.678999999999
it really really made me laugh a lot

6318.239 --> 6321.678999999999
I still have it on my computer

6323.219 --> 6327.32
I'll give you a link to the first part

6329.639 --> 6332.2390000000005
foreign

6334.4 --> 6342.199
dude what the [ __ ] is this

6338.159 --> 6342.199
ah all right

6344.28 --> 6348.54
so this is the video there's a lot of

6346.5 --> 6351.179
swearing it's a pretty it's a messed up

6348.54 --> 6354.659
guy that guy is definitely like an

6351.179 --> 6358.38
just some stupid gamer or something but

6354.659 --> 6360.839999999999
I I know this entire video which is

6358.38 --> 6366.26
together I think 20 minutes I know it by

6360.84 --> 6366.26
heart I know every part of it it's crazy

6366.36 --> 6370.0199999999995
and I quote

6367.98 --> 6372.54
thinks that he says

6370.02 --> 6374.52
not the the more outstanding remarks

6372.54 --> 6377.94
because of their kind of dated

6374.52 --> 6382.639
but just the way he gets frustrated and

6377.94 --> 6385.98
says like [ __ ] You Mario [ __ ] you

6382.639 --> 6389.719
just he says it in a very peculiar way

6385.98 --> 6389.718999999999
and I thought it was freaking hilarious

6390.78 --> 6396.36
I haven't watched it in like 10 years

6393.719 --> 6399.4800000000005
so yeah I think I already shared this

6396.36 --> 6404.339999999999
silly video like three years ago when I

6399.48 --> 6407.04
for Early Bird shows but yeah anyway

6404.34 --> 6411.5
how many Earthly convos you have with

6407.04 --> 6414.86
people in my community in reality

6411.5 --> 6414.86
what community

6417.119 --> 6421.44
my community what the hell are you

6419.46 --> 6423.179
talking about my community

6421.44 --> 6426.379999999999
what community

6423.179 --> 6426.38
you mean my dad

6431.46 --> 6436.8
I've talked with my dad about Flat Earth

6433.92 --> 6440.04
a couple of times he's on board with it

6436.8 --> 6443.639
he's not an expert at it but at least he

6440.04 --> 6445.619
could follow my conception of or or My

6443.639 --> 6447.96
realization I should say because I'm

6445.619 --> 6450.0599999999995
dead on correct with this that the

6447.96 --> 6451.92
celestials are non-local Holograms he

6450.06 --> 6453.42
got that I was able to explain it to him

6451.92 --> 6454.86
that he would actually be able to feed

6453.42 --> 6457.139
it back

6454.86 --> 6459.48
in a way that proves that he understood

6457.139 --> 6461.76
so

6459.48 --> 6464.4
people in my area I don't talk to people

6461.76 --> 6467.719
in my area barely

6464.4 --> 6467.719
I mean they know I'm there

6469.26 --> 6473.0
I don't really talk to anybody

6475.619 --> 6479.82
I mean sometimes people come walking up

6478.02 --> 6481.619000000001
and talk to me but it's just like about

6479.82 --> 6484.259999999999
the weather or something and that's

6481.619 --> 6487.619
usually what I end up talking about or

6484.26 --> 6489.3
just praising the environment like don't

6487.619 --> 6493.08
you think it's like beautiful out here

6489.3 --> 6495.659000000001
look at a beautiful weather is and that

6493.08 --> 6497.82
sort of thing I don't talk about Flat

6495.659 --> 6500.94
Earth I mean if somebody's gonna ask me

6497.82 --> 6503.82
hey what do you do then I'll say yeah if

6500.94 --> 6506.04
actually I'm a YouTuber and

6503.82 --> 6507.78
they want to hear more I'll eventually

6506.04 --> 6510.179
drop that I'm talking about Flat Earth

6507.78 --> 6513.0599999999995
yeah but after that point people don't

6510.179 --> 6515.4
start inquiring okay last person I

6513.06 --> 6518.04
talked to said that I'm into Flat Earth

6515.4 --> 6520.619
was like the new roommate

6518.04 --> 6523.199
she never asked about Flat Earth after

6520.619 --> 6526.58
that point not a single time

6523.199 --> 6526.58
so she just doesn't care

6533.119 --> 6540.9
don't you do they not understand how why

6537.84 --> 6544.56
why is it so important

6540.9 --> 6547.32
what is important that they should be

6544.56 --> 6549.360000000001
faced with how [ __ ] up the control

6547.32 --> 6551.099999999999
systems around them are so they don't

6549.36 --> 6552.179
really feel comfortable in their life

6551.1 --> 6554.159000000001
anymore

6552.179 --> 6557.119
what the [ __ ] is even the relevance of

6554.159 --> 6557.119
them knowing about it

6557.699 --> 6561.5
why would they need to know about it

6567.6 --> 6571.619000000001
scientific chat yeah I don't know any

6569.699 --> 6574.259999999999
people that are into that

6571.619 --> 6577.38
they're not here there's no people that

6574.26 --> 6580.58
are into that and I guarantee you the

6577.38 --> 6585.36
ones that are they're Mega Ball tarts

6580.58 --> 6588.3
mega mega ball Tarts yeah there's no

6585.36 --> 6591.239
people here at all

6588.3 --> 6592.9800000000005
that are into science even know what the

6591.239 --> 6595.86
[ __ ] that means

6592.98 --> 6597.419999999999
that aren't hardcore ballers they do not

6595.86 --> 6600.179
exist here

6597.42 --> 6602.52
they're very rare

6600.179 --> 6605.04
they're not here I mean there's they're

6602.52 --> 6607.139
probably around in the Netherlands I

6605.04 --> 6609.719
don't bump into them

6607.139 --> 6611.639
if I did they would probably recognize

6609.719 --> 6613.5
me like hey you're a flat earther on

6611.639 --> 6617.6990000000005
YouTube aren't you yeah that's never

6613.5 --> 6619.86
happened before ever except for wife of

6617.699 --> 6622.799999999999
arakil the Hope who bumped into me one

6619.86 --> 6625.86
time at the grocery store and recognized

6622.8 --> 6629.34
me that's the only time anybody's ever

6625.86 --> 6631.739
walked up to me say hey I recognize you

6629.34 --> 6634.02
one time

6631.739 --> 6637.799999999999
like four years ago now

6634.02 --> 6639.42
so nobody gives a [ __ ] dude I tell

6637.8 --> 6641.1
people sometimes like yeah I'm on

6639.42 --> 6644.76
YouTube here here's my this is my name

6641.1 --> 6646.08
check it out never hear anything back

6644.76 --> 6647.6990000000005
ever

6646.08 --> 6650.219
they don't care

6647.699 --> 6651.78
it's too complicated it's too

6650.219 --> 6653.88
complicated for them

6651.78 --> 6655.92
they don't have they're not ready to

6653.88 --> 6658.08
handle me

6655.92 --> 6660.78
because people are just they're

6658.08 --> 6663.3
entangled into the retardation of

6660.78 --> 6665.759999999999
society they don't have the room for

6663.3 --> 6668.04
that if they actually accept me on the

6665.76 --> 6669.780000000001
higher level it's literally gonna

6668.04 --> 6673.08
distort their life

6669.78 --> 6675.619
but everybody's entangled fully up in

6673.08 --> 6675.619
this [ __ ]

6683.28 --> 6688.8
yeah and I'm not

6685.38 --> 6690.42
ever going to push it on people I will

6688.8 --> 6692.96
not do that

6690.42 --> 6692.96
ever

6696.179 --> 6704.1
tried that a couple of times in the past

6698.36 --> 6704.099999999999
with disastrous end results disastrous

6704.52 --> 6708.659000000001
yeah

6706.679 --> 6711.06
I'm never doing that again

6708.659 --> 6713.04
if somebody wants to know if somebody

6711.06 --> 6716.639
actually wants to know

6713.04 --> 6719.76
I'll notice I'm not noticing it yeah

6716.639 --> 6724.04
nobody gives a [ __ ] out there so hey

6719.76 --> 6724.04
continue not giving a [ __ ] then

6725.46 --> 6730.9800000000005
I could just see me at a distance

6728.34 --> 6732.659000000001
fine they know I'm here some of them

6730.98 --> 6735.9
might even know what I do but they're

6732.659 --> 6737.94
not talking to me about it ever so why

6735.9 --> 6740.82
should I care if nobody cares about me

6737.94 --> 6743.099999999999
why the [ __ ] should I care

6740.82 --> 6748.759999999999
yeah it's kind of nice and comfortable

6743.1 --> 6748.76
just being left alone like that fine

6748.92 --> 6751.159
foreign
