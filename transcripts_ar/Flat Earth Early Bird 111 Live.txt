279.929 --> 291.409
I don't ban people for asking questions

286.229 --> 293.75899999999996
i ban people for spamming though and

291.409 --> 295.61899999999997
repeating the same question over and

293.759 --> 298.409
over again even though that I did give

295.619 --> 300.899
an answer so I do ban people for that I

298.409 --> 305.80899999999997
do ban people for trolling not for

300.899 --> 305.809
asking questions damn it Nathan

307.97 --> 312.38000000000005
stop

309.62 --> 314.68
stop competing with me your shows not up

312.38 --> 314.68
yet

321.42 --> 328.31
so who will join my panel bring in the

325.68 --> 328.31
subjects

329.069 --> 333.71000000000004
I'm up for talking about absolutely

331.289 --> 333.71
everything

367.84 --> 375.15
so who get in here who's up for the

372.639 --> 375.15000000000003
challenge

386.54 --> 393.26000000000005
I'm gonna try to take it slow it's

389.39 --> 395.74
probably gonna end up just same thing as

393.26 --> 395.74
usual

416.4 --> 422.69
yeah the actuals nobody's getting paid

419.69 --> 422.69
nobody

424.22 --> 430.90000000000003
it's just the lack of purpose that

426.92 --> 437.74
drives people to obsessively draw

430.9 --> 437.73999999999995
nobody's getting paid you know

443.87 --> 450.5
it's the freedom of the Internet the

445.94 --> 454.479
freedom to contribute good things and to

450.5 --> 454.479
contribute disruption

468.159 --> 476.889
yeah only Shibu can't see well if you're

473.499 --> 483.809
afraid that people are sick of you then

476.889 --> 483.809
adapt what are they sick of

485.039 --> 488.18
what do you have

490.509 --> 493.889
I'm not a really sick of you

498.96 --> 505.54999999999995
all right

501.5 --> 506.03
yes guy fly bride though that was you

505.55 --> 509.18
right

506.03 --> 510.07
yeah I heard it yeah it was pretty it

509.18 --> 514.669
was nice

510.07 --> 518.99
although yeah it's not really in line

514.669 --> 523.11
with the type of music that I would use

518.99 --> 526.47
for my show it's just

523.11 --> 530.58
but it was a good attempt and was it was

526.47 --> 533.39
funny it was amusing so thanks for yeah

530.58 --> 533.39
thanks for trying

539.97 --> 549.629
I'm just really really really picky when

544.799 --> 553.049
it comes to music and yeah like Chris

549.629 --> 556.379
Barry you know he made this song for

553.049 --> 559.319
this show and that's like not his first

556.379 --> 562.1990000000001
thing okay I kind of pushed him into

559.319 --> 565.7289999999999
making something pretty specific and he

562.199 --> 565.7289999999999
did it perfectly eventually

572.57 --> 577.0
our mistress this is

578.08 --> 581.4100000000001
that'd be interesting

593.0 --> 596.35
so come on guys

609.06 --> 615.14
yeah health music is cool well

612.65 --> 620.74
depends on what you consider elf music

615.14 --> 625.34
you know if you gonna refer to the

620.74 --> 628.01
fantasy based elven culture that has

625.34 --> 631.7900000000001
been reflected upon and interpreted in

628.01 --> 633.2
many ways through games and through

631.79 --> 635.7199999999999
movies and all that

633.2 --> 638.6
yeah that's pretty pretty interesting

635.72 --> 643.46
what they made out of it feels pretty

638.6 --> 648.83
good but yeah that's still fantasy stuff

643.46 --> 651.4300000000001
so I don't know you know what are they I

648.83 --> 651.4300000000001
don't know

671.95 --> 679.9200000000001
okay Sabrina browning says there's

674.61 --> 684.73
chemtrails everywhere over at her place

679.92 --> 686.5
yeah that's that's not nice I I don't

684.73 --> 690.279
know if they're chemtrails out here cuz

686.5 --> 693.55
it's just all gray I think I did see a

690.279 --> 696.48
couple earlier but yeah you can't really

693.55 --> 699.75
see the chemtrails through the clouds

696.48 --> 699.75
right now

729.74 --> 734.2090000000001
thank you a rapid didn't X

745.33 --> 747.75
that's

751.64 --> 759.1899999999999
what did i do yesterday evening before

754.16 --> 762.67
or wait yeah I had my 9 hour show and

759.19 --> 765.4100000000001
then sort of at the end moved over to

762.67 --> 771.31
Nathan's and Patricia's hangout which

765.41 --> 771.31
was pretty good it's pretty epic

788.87 --> 793.929
sorry I'm

791.24 --> 796.4590000000001
I'm an unusually at a loss for words

793.929 --> 800.8389999999999
it's just like I just want to say like

796.459 --> 804.829
yes it's cool it's interesting it has so

800.839 --> 808.7900000000001
many good points to that specific field

804.829 --> 811.399
and then for me it's very interesting to

808.79 --> 814.0889999999999
reflect upon with everything else that's

811.399 --> 814.089
happening out there

819.23 --> 829.72
so yeah so do the news subjects that do

823.7 --> 832.58
pop up and the responses everywhere

829.72 --> 837.4100000000001
they're all so interesting I'm just like

832.58 --> 841.58
yeah it's interesting to me and it's a

837.41 --> 844.27
little bit much all of it have a good

841.58 --> 844.2700000000001
feeling though

853.36 --> 860.489
yeah yesterday's early bird was also

856.48 --> 865.929
really good with ally be on there and

860.489 --> 868.299
and Reese I would love to do that again

865.929 --> 872.639
I don't know if he's there right now but

868.299 --> 872.639
yeah be good to have

893.43 --> 896.2099999999999
four in each

902.69 --> 910.0600000000001
right yeah karatbars this is also about

906.769 --> 914.99
Flat Earth it's about a lot of things

910.06 --> 918.56
but yeah at this time I just I could do

914.99 --> 921.5600000000001
a lot of reflecting I just don't really

918.56 --> 924.41
have a story ready maybe it's because I

921.56 --> 926.6289999999999
was watching the podcast and that's

924.41 --> 928.55
filling me up currently and still kind

926.629 --> 933.6990000000001
of like in observation mode

928.55 --> 933.699
not so much in storytelling mode

948.57 --> 952.0200000000001
interesting question do you think there

950.73 --> 953.94
is a relationship between the

952.02 --> 957.36
magnetosphere and weather patterns

953.94 --> 963.3900000000001
I'll do the magnetic reaction reacting

957.36 --> 966.09
chemtrails really harmless well yeah I

963.39 --> 969.41
don't really know for sure but yeah

966.09 --> 972.86
there's been theories about it you know

969.41 --> 976.11
metallic particles can be used to relay

972.86 --> 981.42
electro magnetics whether it be

976.11 --> 985.23
atmospheric from from weather systems or

981.42 --> 989.04
potentially like you the communications

985.23 --> 990.24
relays or ji5 enhancers oh there's so

989.04 --> 993.8399999999999
many approach to it

990.24 --> 995.4
now I don't know for sure anymore

993.84 --> 1001.24
there's so many angles to so many things

995.4 --> 1001.24
and yeah and

1002.32 --> 1011.1
for me I don't know it it's so much I'm

1006.399 --> 1011.1
starting to like

1011.32 --> 1019.1500000000001
wonder how can we confirm it because

1017.32 --> 1022.3900000000001
that's gonna be more important how do

1019.15 --> 1026.79
you actually confirm a source or a

1022.39 --> 1026.79
factoid and

1027.43 --> 1032.17
yeah with chemtrails for me it is

1029.8 --> 1034.6
there's been so much speculation so many

1032.17 --> 1037.63
stories about it I just really want to

1034.6 --> 1042.28
know like these chemtrails what we get

1037.63 --> 1045.2800000000002
to see what is that currently not what

1042.28 --> 1047.68
it might have been at some point but

1045.28 --> 1051.8799999999999
what are they spraying right now what is

1047.68 --> 1055.0900000000001
that is that still the aluminum barium

1051.88 --> 1059.5500000000002
salts and all that stuff all that crap

1055.09 --> 1061.99
or are they spraying just basic

1059.55 --> 1067.11
CloudFormation dust particles or

1061.99 --> 1067.11
something I don't know I don't know

1068.68 --> 1073.5700000000002
I know I don't like seeing the

1070.9 --> 1076.21
chemtrails out there I know they get in

1073.57 --> 1079.5
the way of the light the sunlight and I

1076.21 --> 1084.309
don't like that no matter what they are

1079.5 --> 1087.4
comprised of and if they do indeed

1084.309 --> 1092.1399999999999
actually keep on spraying that yeah it's

1087.4 --> 1097.5700000000002
gonna be harmful or life in general and

1092.14 --> 1100.8090000000002
that case I don't know why they white

1097.57 --> 1103.0
even continues why it's not stop why

1100.809 --> 1105.45
they're not halting it even from the

1103.0 --> 1105.45
inside

1112.46 --> 1121.029
all right well Effie fun food or flatter

1116.21 --> 1121.029
theater they don't exist

1122.5 --> 1129.88
no I don't have any updates on Riley I

1125.47 --> 1133.9
leave the updates on Riley to Riley I'm

1129.88 --> 1137.5590000000002
not following him like every step to see

1133.9 --> 1140.98
what he's doing was like you know I do

1137.559 --> 1142.809
what I do so if you want to have any

1140.98 --> 1144.76
updates from what he's doing then you

1142.809 --> 1147.52
have to go to his channel or to the

1144.76 --> 1152.23
debates and wait for him to pop up and

1147.52 --> 1154.69
talk about it and who knows maybe might

1152.23 --> 1157.47
at some point choose to pop up over here

1154.69 --> 1157.47
that will be fine

1162.02 --> 1164.65
right

1172.81 --> 1182.0
it's just that

1175.71 --> 1189.06
there's so many seeming dark things

1182.0 --> 1191.22
happening industrialized almost and well

1189.06 --> 1193.62
Alex Jones in the podcast of course

1191.22 --> 1200.67
brings it to the absolute maximum every

1193.62 --> 1203.4599999999998
time so yeah it's just so much what do

1200.67 --> 1208.5900000000001
we do about it can can we do something

1203.46 --> 1211.17
about it all at the same time or do we

1208.59 --> 1213.7099999999998
have to like pick the things apart one

1211.17 --> 1213.71
at a time

1221.669 --> 1223.909
and

1227.91 --> 1235.23
I don't know I'm I don't know

1232.69 --> 1235.23
like

1235.73 --> 1242.24
people are standing up people are pissed

1238.22 --> 1247.039
off people are trying to find learn more

1242.24 --> 1251.96
of course become part of the this is the

1247.039 --> 1256.76
media and psychological war front from

1251.96 --> 1260.2
the people's side you could say is that

1256.76 --> 1264.1589999999999
all working is that gonna be enough

1260.2 --> 1267.82
like we damn well hope so I'll bet you

1264.159 --> 1272.1100000000001
what I'm having a lot of trouble just

1267.82 --> 1274.97
getting a clearer look on this on the

1272.11 --> 1281.139
from the motions of it because it is so

1274.97 --> 1281.1390000000001
wide and complex and multi-angle dand

1282.62 --> 1287.7099999999998
well it's a dimensional in nature

1284.35 --> 1287.7099999999998
throughout time

1297.84 --> 1301.1899999999998
lo Nathan

1301.87 --> 1305.279
it's a great space for me

1306.46 --> 1310.48
yeah

1308.08 --> 1312.8799999999999
I don't know like I'm only halfway to

1310.48 --> 1316.2
podcast and maybe he's gonna talk a lot

1312.88 --> 1320.4
more about spacing it's pretty funny

1316.2 --> 1320.4
with Eddie Bravo in there

1323.01 --> 1327.48
I don't know I'll just have to see the

1324.72 --> 1331.29
rest of it I had no idea if it's just as

1327.48 --> 1334.98
intense as the first half and I can't

1331.29 --> 1338.33
really judge about it so I'm we have to

1334.98 --> 1338.33
gonna watch the entire thing

1339.47 --> 1344.299
all right also a little bit of a sound

1341.629 --> 1346.6689999999999
update I got some help from flattened

1344.299 --> 1351.83
earth you offered it Thank You flattened

1346.669 --> 1355.19
earth and I'm making a little progress

1351.83 --> 1357.4089999999999
with the audio situation managed to find

1355.19 --> 1360.1390000000001
the right control panel and everything

1357.409 --> 1362.0
but yeah I got stuck again because ya

1360.139 --> 1366.289
told me like okay now make this the

1362.0 --> 1370.85
default and suddenly all sounds calm so

1366.289 --> 1374.33
yeah that little bit of a obstacle right

1370.85 --> 1380.2099999999998
there but I hope I will work through

1374.33 --> 1383.9189999999999
that and gets finally get some proper

1380.21 --> 1383.919
audio going on my shows

1388.94 --> 1394.06
because I'm pretty sick of my bad sound

1391.22 --> 1394.06
quality as well

1406.68 --> 1409.3400000000001
now

1410.309 --> 1416.549
no I don't think that Nathan Oakley and

1413.46 --> 1420.359
and Joe Rogan wouldn't work well

1416.549 --> 1423.45
together although maybe if like Eddie

1420.359 --> 1427.6789999999999
Bravo was in between there it's funny

1423.45 --> 1430.32
how they call him the ambassador like so

1427.679 --> 1434.549
typical but yeah he can't fulfill that

1430.32 --> 1437.129
function in there and yeah because if it

1434.549 --> 1439.889
was just 101 things would probably get

1437.129 --> 1445.019
out of hand pretty quickly probably go

1439.889 --> 1448.039
straight into the Joe Rogan basically

1445.019 --> 1451.109
finding the insanity angle to it and

1448.039 --> 1456.629
Nathan doing his absolutely bottom-line

1451.109 --> 1459.379
hardcore approach with everything it

1456.629 --> 1463.259
would it would be heavy [ __ ]

1459.379 --> 1465.269
but yeah it's also going to be kind of

1463.259 --> 1469.679
disruptive I think but although maybe

1465.269 --> 1475.58
who knows maybe that will happen what

1469.679 --> 1475.5800000000002
I'm wondering sometimes it's like wow

1475.74 --> 1482.789
you know I'm so fascinated by my Alex

1479.64 --> 1486.51
Jones's stories about his background

1482.789 --> 1491.97
about his experiences and I would like

1486.51 --> 1496.83
to just I don't know talk to him but my

1491.97 --> 1499.44
god this I don't know what the Freak

1496.83 --> 1502.34
would happen if that would be done and

1499.44 --> 1505.6490000000001
he'd probably say like that's ridiculous

1502.34 --> 1510.6
why would he even do that like little

1505.649 --> 1513.6589999999999
old me you know so I guess that's just

1510.6 --> 1516.4499999999998
gonna be a fantasy but it would be

1513.659 --> 1519.21
really interesting to compare my

1516.45 --> 1522.8990000000001
experience is my dark world vision

1519.21 --> 1527.309
experiences like lay out the details of

1522.899 --> 1529.289
what how I analyze things like spatially

1527.309 --> 1532.6789999999999
analyzed things and the workings of how

1529.289 --> 1536.789
that worked and then see how he reflects

1532.679 --> 1539.1490000000001
on it i if he agrees with things or if

1536.789 --> 1543.1
there's like angles to things that I

1539.149 --> 1546.55
haven't thought up

1543.1 --> 1550.23
lay it laid next to one another all

1546.55 --> 1550.23
right yeah

1551.73 --> 1562.83
Alex I wouldn't an egomaniac it's

1556.399 --> 1566.779
complicated but I think yeah there could

1562.83 --> 1566.779
be two things happening if I do it

1569.75 --> 1577.35
no I don't listen to black metal but I

1573.24 --> 1578.91
have I still have like the CDs and

1577.35 --> 1587.0
everything but I don't listen to that

1578.91 --> 1593.16
haven't for a long time well Alex Jones

1587.0 --> 1595.98
does not make stuff up but he does

1593.16 --> 1600.3600000000001
chisel his information a little he does

1595.98 --> 1603.8700000000001
tinker it's been with him been trying to

1600.36 --> 1605.79
tell and yeah he does it pretty

1603.87 --> 1610.86
eloquently he's gotten really good at it

1605.79 --> 1613.4099999999999
and I'm just always wondering like what

1610.86 --> 1617.7299999999998
would happen would he like straight out

1613.41 --> 1620.67
assault me call me like you are the

1617.73 --> 1623.43
controller or a globalist or something

1620.67 --> 1626.3700000000001
else that I completely don't expect or

1623.43 --> 1628.41
woody but GB just like yeah I know

1626.37 --> 1631.56
you're a nice guy but you don't know

1628.41 --> 1634.71
what you got yourself into and be more

1631.56 --> 1637.53
like a father figure very done

1634.71 --> 1640.53
throttling on me because yeah he is the

1637.53 --> 1645.86
big man he was the big alpha he he takes

1640.53 --> 1648.78
it all and I just think that probably

1645.86 --> 1651.7199999999998
chemistry social chemistry-wise it

1648.78 --> 1653.94
probably wouldn't work if it would ever

1651.72 --> 1659.31
even possibly get to that point because

1653.94 --> 1661.47
yeah Who am I just a guy in youtube with

1659.31 --> 1666.87
maybe some interesting insights and

1661.47 --> 1669.0
ideas that yeah I come up with stuff way

1666.87 --> 1671.6699999999998
before other people do in a certain

1669.0 --> 1674.4
sense and that is kind of an interesting

1671.67 --> 1677.04
element about me I guess but other than

1674.4 --> 1681.0300000000002
that yeah do societally I'm a mess

1677.04 --> 1684.92
and I've been focusing much more on the

1681.03 --> 1687.6299999999999
path of balance and not on being

1684.92 --> 1689.8700000000001
gigantic and in the scope of everyone

1687.63 --> 1693.3100000000002
and

1689.87 --> 1698.09
the methodology is completely different

1693.31 --> 1701.2
and I don't know he might just interpret

1698.09 --> 1704.4199999999998
it in a dark way he might interpret me

1701.2 --> 1706.7
like trying to emphasize balance and how

1704.42 --> 1708.6200000000001
the darkness infiltrates all things and

1706.7 --> 1712.25
comes in from back and how that works

1708.62 --> 1715.37
the you might interpret that as we

1712.25 --> 1722.87
actually championing the darkness well

1715.37 --> 1726.07
yeah I don't do that hmm but I do try to

1722.87 --> 1729.7399999999998
understand it where it's coming from

1726.07 --> 1736.25
anyway have we've been joined by Rhys

1729.74 --> 1737.83
thank you for coming I don't know how

1736.25 --> 1740.7
are you doing

1737.83 --> 1740.6999999999998
yeah I'm good

1740.87 --> 1747.3799999999999
cool

1743.06 --> 1749.36
so yeah I was I was contem

1747.38 --> 1754.19
you know going over and reviewing what

1749.36 --> 1758.4799999999998
we talked about with Ali and I was

1754.19 --> 1766.46
wondering what is the overall goal for

1758.48 --> 1769.49
then them it's like

1766.46 --> 1773.2
who's them in this case like it like

1769.49 --> 1781.73
like mother yeah okay well let's make

1773.2 --> 1786.1100000000001
what is what is the overall goal is it

1781.73 --> 1793.66
to get ahead or have they been promised

1786.11 --> 1799.85
something Rose who who work straight

1793.66 --> 1807.5
those who spend money to to cover things

1799.85 --> 1812.84
up since me in all aspects what is the

1807.5 --> 1814.73
goal the goal I don't know I think it's

1812.84 --> 1817.28
compartmentalized I think that people

1814.73 --> 1819.6200000000001
that do keeps things covered up at this

1817.28 --> 1825.41
point are probably just doing it to try

1819.62 --> 1829.9099999999999
to keep things stable because it touches

1825.41 --> 1835.15
upon so many fronts of power that when

1829.91 --> 1835.15
unraveled can technically unleash chaos

1836.47 --> 1841.83
do you think there's enough resources

1838.36 --> 1841.83
for everyone who lives on the planet

1845.6 --> 1857.51
technically yes easily but depends on

1851.57 --> 1861.47
what the state of everyone is because

1857.51 --> 1866.0
everybody has to agree that everybody

1861.47 --> 1868.4
gets all of that and yeah especially

1866.0 --> 1872.05
look in times of great freedom and

1868.4 --> 1876.5600000000002
prosperity yet the ego comes along and

1872.05 --> 1880.04
makes people decide like no we can build

1876.56 --> 1883.31
something more out of this so let's take

1880.04 --> 1888.4099999999999
it away from people we think are wasting

1883.31 --> 1892.85
it and yeah and then that's how that

1888.41 --> 1898.48
starts it's the cycle you know what

1892.85 --> 1898.48
happens so it's very difficult

1898.95 --> 1904.6200000000001
so as was the balance thing people

1901.31 --> 1906.78
people have to mature to a certain level

1904.62 --> 1910.9799999999998
so that they can be appreciative and

1906.78 --> 1913.6499999999999
giving at the same time well by the way

1910.98 --> 1918.44
to be able to take the responsibility of

1913.65 --> 1918.44
true freedom which is very difficult

1924.9 --> 1930.3000000000002
but yeah that's from a very

1927.23 --> 1933.66
philosophically neutral standpoint

1930.3 --> 1935.6699999999998
because yeah while yeah the controller's

1933.66 --> 1941.0700000000002
keeping this in place are doing that

1935.67 --> 1943.65
they've also engaged into darkness that

1941.07 --> 1945.51
could be considered irredeemable at the

1943.65 --> 1949.2900000000002
same time so again it's it's a

1945.51 --> 1953.0
double-edged sword it's like an

1949.29 --> 1956.3999999999999
advantage with a big disadvantage it's

1953.0 --> 1959.0
it's how they balance the sword on their

1956.4 --> 1959.0
fingertip

1962.71 --> 1972.22
yeah because I was thinking you know

1964.59 --> 1976.62
last night well that's yeah it's it's an

1972.22 --> 1979.27
idea that you know it's easy to say but

1976.62 --> 1981.9399999999998
um you know I'm very blessed to be in

1979.27 --> 1983.47
New Zealand and have such a small

1981.94 --> 1985.9
population you know what I mean like

1983.47 --> 1988.6000000000001
it's only been stealing steadily growing

1985.9 --> 1993.49
in over the years but nothing to excess

1988.6 --> 1996.07
you know and when I was in Japan there's

1993.49 --> 1997.96
a lot of people you know just everywhere

1996.07 --> 2001.74
when I was in Tokyo there's even more

1997.96 --> 2009.8
people and it was a different

2001.74 --> 2013.68
environment but say I don't have so many

2009.8 --> 2016.44
multiple you know levels of

2013.68 --> 2019.3200000000002
consciousness seen in my day-to-day you

2016.44 --> 2022.23
know I don't I don't see hundreds and

2019.32 --> 2027.99
hundreds of people a day like I used to

2022.23 --> 2030.24
and it's I guess it's easier when you

2027.99 --> 2032.28
don't have to deal with so many

2030.24 --> 2035.55
different people walking down the street

2032.28 --> 2037.1399999999999
you know and I kind of took a step back

2035.55 --> 2041.46
and realize that maybe the things that

2037.14 --> 2045.0900000000001
I've been saying might not be as easy

2041.46 --> 2050.32
because there's so many you know there's

2045.09 --> 2052.81
so many things out there but yeah

2050.32 --> 2055.9900000000002
I just want to apologize to anybody who

2052.81 --> 2057.73
it was listing if I offended them well

2055.99 --> 2060.7299999999996
you know it's easier said than done in

2057.73 --> 2062.83
fact mentality because I know that it I

2060.73 --> 2065.35
know that it could be more difficult if

2062.83 --> 2066.85
there were 20 more negative 30 more

2065.35 --> 2072.22
negative people that I had to encounter

2066.85 --> 2076.899
in my day and yeah but it's about guy

2072.22 --> 2082.47
effort look you think that what Jesus

2076.899 --> 2086.109
was saying at the time was easy you know

2082.47 --> 2088.0899999999997
yeah so it's okay it's about the intent

2086.109 --> 2091.54
it's about trying to give an example

2088.09 --> 2096.2200000000003
give a way through to do it the right

2091.54 --> 2098.02
way and of course things will ya get in

2096.22 --> 2101.85
the way of that when other people try it

2098.02 --> 2106.5
out that's the challenge you know it's

2101.85 --> 2106.5
it's about looking and trying

2107.29 --> 2114.99
and I don't think you did anything wrong

2109.42 --> 2118.86
you know you're just doing your best

2114.99 --> 2118.8599999999997
it's just to me

2119.49 --> 2128.25
you know you know you know it's like I

2123.29 --> 2130.32
can't remove the feelings that are in me

2128.25 --> 2133.619
I can't remove the face that I have you

2130.32 --> 2136.94
know it's a joke to think that you know

2133.619 --> 2139.6800000000003
I could it's just because it's

2136.94 --> 2145.92
interlaced with every thought form I

2139.68 --> 2152.58
have and you know it's it's something

2145.92 --> 2154.02
that that I feel I need to share and I

2152.58 --> 2158.2799999999997
would much you know I'd much rather

2154.02 --> 2162.68
someone told me you know to my face like

2158.28 --> 2165.599
don't talk about it anymore versus like

2162.68 --> 2166.71
talk behind my back and say noise he's

2165.599 --> 2170.19
always talking about it

2166.71 --> 2176.76
bah bah blah you know and so I like I

2170.19 --> 2180.81
like honesty you know mm-hmm so yeah i

2176.76 --> 2184.6400000000003
think i think that that's what i try to

2180.81 --> 2184.64
put out you know right

2185.059 --> 2191.029
yeah and there's always going to be

2188.439 --> 2196.1589999999997
multiple angles to the interpretations

2191.029 --> 2199.579
that come to that so yeah that's that's

2196.159 --> 2201.859
always gonna happen you you know just

2199.579 --> 2207.1400000000003
think about what would have happened if

2201.859 --> 2211.279
you hadn't there would still be people

2207.14 --> 2213.169
out there that would complain you know

2211.279 --> 2215.719
they're always gonna be people that are

2213.169 --> 2218.419
gonna say you're doing it wrong you can

2215.719 --> 2221.119
even like field test this and by doing

2218.419 --> 2223.8489999999997
it like a show or something and doing it

2221.119 --> 2226.219
like in one way and then doing another

2223.849 --> 2229.719
show demonstratively doing it exactly

2226.219 --> 2233.299
the opposite you're gonna have the same

2229.719 --> 2235.789
balance of responses like one group's

2233.299 --> 2236.869
gonna say oh this is perfect and the

2235.789 --> 2241.13
other say why are you doing everything

2236.869 --> 2243.559
wrong doesn't really matter only thing

2241.13 --> 2247.9390000000003
that matters is that you think you're

2243.559 --> 2252.7090000000003
doing the right thing and that you can

2247.939 --> 2255.819
reason that out and you can get ya

2252.709 --> 2255.819
reflection on that

2256.25 --> 2265.33
proof responsibility just

2261.5 --> 2268.34
I just don't you know I don't want to

2265.33 --> 2270.89
knock down or rip away or destroy the

2268.34 --> 2274.52
foundations that might give people

2270.89 --> 2275.96
strength so might give them their own

2274.52 --> 2280.52
way through because I'm not walking

2275.96 --> 2285.23
their path and and you know what I mean

2280.52 --> 2287.81
so I also have the beliefs that the

2285.23 --> 2290.93
Creator has enough power to the guide

2287.81 --> 2296.06
who he will you know who it will decide

2290.93 --> 2302.48
to guide it will and right you know yeah

2296.06 --> 2305.42
I just think you know my my favorite my

2302.48 --> 2309.59
favorite topic is faith then the creator

2305.42 --> 2313.69
and questions directed why can't happen

2309.59 --> 2317.2400000000002
why I can't be and and it's you know I

2313.69 --> 2321.02
don't know I I think that I think I

2317.24 --> 2323.0299999999997
always have an answer you know that's

2321.02 --> 2328.359
one topic that I feel I can really tap

2323.03 --> 2333.05
into myself and and say no you know I

2328.359 --> 2334.339
can I can you know I'm I'm happy to

2333.05 --> 2335.69
admit ignorance if I don't know

2334.339 --> 2337.97
something you know during a conversation

2335.69 --> 2340.67
like oh sorry what is it what does that

2337.97 --> 2344.48
word mean no you know I like to learn

2340.67 --> 2346.13
I'd like to know by opening up that that

2344.48 --> 2353.69
ability for myself to learn something

2346.13 --> 2356.69
you know I I can grow but you know it's

2353.69 --> 2356.69
yeah

2357.26 --> 2363.59
very really that I don't have the words

2360.2 --> 2367.609
come to the forefront to be able to

2363.59 --> 2370.58
answer and and give my opinion or take

2367.609 --> 2372.44
on something you know to do with face

2370.58 --> 2376.0099999999998
scriptures creator you know there's

2372.44 --> 2385.78
always something that is right there for

2376.01 --> 2385.78
me to consider and so yeah I mean yeah

2385.85 --> 2392.0
I never want it to become too much but I

2389.38 --> 2394.4300000000003
it's never gonna go away you know I mean

2392.0 --> 2397.88
like what I've been through and what

2394.43 --> 2402.3999999999996
I've witnessed and what I know plus what

2397.88 --> 2402.4
I learn it's never going away it I mean

2403.6 --> 2406.7799999999997
so it's

2407.46 --> 2414.359
it's that part that makes us maybe the

2411.359 --> 2417.359
most vulnerable to talk about the

2414.359 --> 2421.19
unknown or the hereafter or you know

2417.359 --> 2427.0789999999997
even the word judgment but I think I

2421.19 --> 2430.559
think it's important to leave the door

2427.079 --> 2431.76
open if you don't know and don't

2430.559 --> 2438.26
understand then you've got to leave the

2431.76 --> 2438.26
door open so right yeah

2438.6 --> 2442.0499999999997
a little bit of you might shut off if

2440.82 --> 2445.3500000000004
you feel that you already know that

2442.05 --> 2449.79
thing where you know you know that way

2445.35 --> 2455.0899999999997
you'll you know it means that yeah yeah

2449.79 --> 2458.09
if you set your ways and green

2455.09 --> 2458.09
specifically

2459.579 --> 2467.44
and not necessarily based on principles

2462.849 --> 2470.17
but yeah

2467.44 --> 2474.19
temporary knowledge or on the situation

2470.17 --> 2478.9
it's very hard to explain but then yeah

2474.19 --> 2482.079
you become rigid and you lose the

2478.9 --> 2485.7090000000003
ability to learn and grow in the process

2482.079 --> 2491.219
or not lose it you purposely shut it off

2485.709 --> 2491.219
to maintain the form that you have

2494.13 --> 2502.55
but it is difficult because yeah swing

2497.88 --> 2504.29
of the pendulum every time

2502.55 --> 2507.32
I think you're doing right and then

2504.29 --> 2509.27
suddenly things swing around again in

2507.32 --> 2510.98
your heart or in your mind and you

2509.27 --> 2513.68
suddenly look at it from another angle

2510.98 --> 2516.44
and then figure out like was I actually

2513.68 --> 2520.22
doing the right thing because I now see

2516.44 --> 2522.65
all these other sides to it like and I

2520.22 --> 2527.4399999999996
feel that's that's kind of like what you

2522.65 --> 2531.53
just experienced and that's good it's

2527.44 --> 2535.01
essential part to always question

2531.53 --> 2537.1090000000004
yourself and your actions and not just

2535.01 --> 2541.4300000000003
let it be colored by the feelings you

2537.109 --> 2545.3199999999997
have in the moment you do it always

2541.43 --> 2549.109
reflect back on the actions afterward

2545.32 --> 2551.3
yeah well that's the thing is it comes

2549.109 --> 2553.64
from the idea of like I could be them

2551.3 --> 2556.7000000000003
you know that could be me I said the

2553.64 --> 2558.5
other day and when I see it you know I

2556.7 --> 2561.9399999999996
guess there's a bit of osmosis kicked in

2558.5 --> 2564.5
and then it was like oh that could be me

2561.94 --> 2567.38
that could be my thoughts that could be

2564.5 --> 2569.599
my belief system that could be you know

2567.38 --> 2571.73
but then the question came do you think

2569.599 --> 2575.869
that the almighty is not powerful enough

2571.73 --> 2579.56
to guide anyone like our true that's

2575.869 --> 2581.1800000000003
true to the ability for each person to

2579.56 --> 2583.94
be led on their own path and when

2581.18 --> 2586.46
they're ready then perhaps but perhaps

2583.94 --> 2589.16
not but who am I to judge

2586.46 --> 2591.53
all I can be as a facilitator of the

2589.16 --> 2594.5
information I know and put it up for

2591.53 --> 2597.77
scrutiny and put it on the table you

2594.5 --> 2600.14
know what I mean and I think if I can if

2597.77 --> 2602.45
I can just give my view and what I've

2600.14 --> 2604.0699999999997
been through and and say hey I'm sorry

2602.45 --> 2608.77
but miracles do happen

2604.07 --> 2611.599
you know and regardless of you you know

2608.77 --> 2614.839
you know haven't heard this before you

2611.599 --> 2619.01
know that's the maybe that's the key

2614.839 --> 2623.0499999999997
miracle has miracles are not mean to be

2619.01 --> 2626.8500000000004
like everyday things you know and so I

2623.05 --> 2629.3100000000004
don't know I I just can't

2626.85 --> 2631.58
I hadn't demanded any man so what you

2629.31 --> 2637.71
see as a miracle

2631.58 --> 2643.59
well the healing overnight was a miracle

2637.71 --> 2647.28
and so really stand out yeah

2643.59 --> 2650.34
it's not a day that goes past that you

2647.28 --> 2652.23
know I spoke to all the doctors and

2650.34 --> 2655.25
everything and they they couldn't

2652.23 --> 2658.32
understand it you know and it's just

2655.25 --> 2661.56
they just wrote it off you know that's

2658.32 --> 2663.57
fine but moving forward it's it hasn't

2661.56 --> 2666.21
you know there hasn't been a day where

2663.57 --> 2669.92
it's you know the God consciousness

2666.21 --> 2673.05
hasn't been with me you know like I've

2669.92 --> 2675.48
you know I've done the calculations of

2673.05 --> 2680.13
the crash and everything it's just like

2675.48 --> 2683.91
why you're like why why did that you

2680.13 --> 2688.8
know why has that happened and moving

2683.91 --> 2692.22
forward you know even now it's I'm in a

2688.8 --> 2695.52
position where I can actually watch your

2692.22 --> 2697.2599999999998
show and be here and not have to worry

2695.52 --> 2698.91
about certain things that others have to

2697.26 --> 2700.53
deal with on a daily basis you know me

2698.91 --> 2705.56
and my partner we don't have a child yet

2700.53 --> 2708.57
you know and so I don't have these I

2705.56 --> 2711.23
don't have these responsibilities like

2708.57 --> 2711.23
others but

2712.18 --> 2719.64
it's such a life is such an enigma so it

2716.65 --> 2721.7200000000003
that whole idea of live and let live

2719.64 --> 2725.1099999999997
providing the person's not trying to

2721.72 --> 2730.33
take away my life to live or pull me

2725.11 --> 2734.05
down to stand up in all we can really do

2730.33 --> 2736.5699999999997
is converse and and share information

2734.05 --> 2740.73
and it doesn't have to be accepted it

2736.57 --> 2744.5800000000004
doesn't have to be you know followed but

2740.73 --> 2747.01
listened to and then reciprocated you

2744.58 --> 2752.02
know the other person here's what they

2747.01 --> 2755.32
have to say in return that's how that's

2752.02 --> 2756.7599999999998
how it's meant to be that's how it seems

2755.32 --> 2758.8500000000004
the most natural that's why we were

2756.76 --> 2761.5600000000004
given the ability to speak and

2758.85 --> 2765.79
contemplate and aware be aware of our

2761.56 --> 2768.2999999999997
existence you know but that's not the

2765.79 --> 2771.61
only thing right you do realize that

2768.3 --> 2775.0
it's a part of the learning process you

2771.61 --> 2779.8900000000003
need there's time for action and there's

2775.0 --> 2785.44
time for learning and reflecting so it's

2779.89 --> 2787.75
not just about talking about it is there

2785.44 --> 2790.03
so it do you feel like there's something

2787.75 --> 2793.2
approaching like something you have to

2790.03 --> 2795.94
do that might change your life like

2793.2 --> 2799.27
absolutely getting kids like that's

2795.94 --> 2800.7400000000002
pretty heavy obstacle you know yeah you

2799.27 --> 2802.69
could see it as an obstacle or as a

2800.74 --> 2807.7
glorious opportunity it's it's pretty

2802.69 --> 2811.59
much gonna be both it's for its getting

2807.7 --> 2815.43
kids is heavy and yeah I I want it very

2811.59 --> 2815.4300000000003
lucky to have a partner

2816.46 --> 2819.27
I am

2821.07 --> 2826.71
this isn't you know it doesn't you know

2825.18 --> 2831.21
her and I are apart right now

2826.71 --> 2835.92
hmm you know because she's in Mexico all

2831.21 --> 2839.4900000000002
right and it's coming to that point now

2835.92 --> 2841.8
where I will be traveling to get her and

2839.49 --> 2848.1499999999996
bring her home and get married and all

2841.8 --> 2848.15
the rest of it but Wow it's like

2850.43 --> 2859.3999999999996
it doesn't it doesn't a day doesn't pass

2854.75 --> 2862.19
without the weight of cognition that

2859.4 --> 2867.52
I've put up on myself I guess and I have

2862.19 --> 2870.62
it easier than others but the idea that

2867.52 --> 2872.03
I've got something to do you know I've

2870.62 --> 2874.64
got something to build I've got

2872.03 --> 2883.15
something to move forward it's coming it

2874.64 --> 2883.15
feels very imminent and I just

2884.88 --> 2889.6800000000003
if I tried to talk to my family or

2886.95 --> 2891.72
anything like that because none of them

2889.68 --> 2896.069
believe in God it would be very

2891.72 --> 2900.1189999999997
difficult you know the closest has come

2896.069 --> 2905.509
a mother soul you know I I respect you

2900.119 --> 2909.589
have your beliefs you know but it's like

2905.509 --> 2916.099
you know then it just doesn't cut it

2909.589 --> 2918.599
because it - I don't know it's too

2916.099 --> 2920.819
you know it's too dismissive I can't I

2918.599 --> 2922.9790000000003
can't entertain right anymore

2920.819 --> 2925.65
conversation the Graduate gets too much

2922.979 --> 2928.0789999999997
so they can say yeah I respect it but

2925.65 --> 2930.39
they're not gonna actually get into it

2928.079 --> 2934.049
with you so you're not gonna have a

2930.39 --> 2939.1189999999997
conversation about it really just

2934.049 --> 2941.67
mention exactly just mentions yep you

2939.119 --> 2946.4100000000003
know when I first when I first built it

2941.67 --> 2948.539
I believed in God back in 2009 my cousin

2946.41 --> 2951.89
came over MIT with my brother and they

2948.539 --> 2951.8900000000003
tried to take me to the shrink

2954.14 --> 2965.269
so it's like for what because I was

2961.059 --> 2973.6400000000003
because I was beginning to talk about

2965.269 --> 2977.7099999999996
faith and express it and it was you know

2973.64 --> 2982.3689999999997
it was always in me but from 2009 it was

2977.71 --> 2988.549
it was verbally coming out you know as

2982.369 --> 2992.989
like it has to be you know it has to be

2988.549 --> 2995.239
more you know and I was just certain

2992.989 --> 2999.23
things that happened leading up to that

2995.239 --> 3000.039
I just it became this just one-way path

2999.23 --> 3006.489
you know

3000.039 --> 3011.559
and now now it's like I said it's it's

3006.489 --> 3016.45
embody meaning it's beyond it's beyond

3011.559 --> 3019.21
question now you know that to you this

3016.45 --> 3021.1299999999997
is you know that but that's I'm not all

3019.21 --> 3023.41
of a sudden gonna stop believing you

3021.13 --> 3024.009
know it's not it it's not a there's not

3023.41 --> 3027.3689999999997
a chance

3024.009 --> 3029.619
you don't have you don't have to well it

3027.369 --> 3033.67
would be good to realize that it's

3029.619 --> 3036.5190000000002
become beyond question to you and that

3033.67 --> 3038.41
the world's not just because you got you

3036.519 --> 3041.819
went there the world's not just suddenly

3038.41 --> 3041.819
gonna [ __ ] with you

3043.13 --> 3048.19
you got there now you basically have to

3045.68 --> 3048.19
defend it

3049.71 --> 3056.62
yeah and it's it's interesting it's like

3054.05 --> 3056.6200000000003
you know

3058.7 --> 3068.269
the clarity is there but there's no way

3064.13 --> 3070.549
there's no one to relay that clarity off

3068.269 --> 3072.3489999999997
and question things and talk about it

3070.549 --> 3076.21
because those realms of conversation

3072.349 --> 3080.779
just there to do too far past this

3076.21 --> 3084.619
everyday right routine lifestyle that my

3080.779 --> 3086.72
family has but yep my dad drinks to

3084.619 --> 3091.299
excess smokes that exists my brother

3086.72 --> 3094.4599999999996
drinks his partner drinks you know and

3091.299 --> 3097.91
it's you know the kid is growing up

3094.46 --> 3100.46
around that and it just it's just

3097.91 --> 3102.589
routine every day and day they don't

3100.46 --> 3104.96
want to I don't want to look any bigger

3102.589 --> 3106.4
things and I used to be the thing that

3104.96 --> 3109.489
they could talk about and gossip about

3106.4 --> 3111.14
and complain about and put my darkness

3109.489 --> 3115.759
before theirs and now that's not an

3111.14 --> 3119.5589999999997
option and you know it's it's it's

3115.759 --> 3123.7690000000002
creating this silence between us but

3119.559 --> 3125.4500000000003
it's also making them realize that we're

3123.769 --> 3127.6699999999996
in Neverland now in the sense that that

3125.45 --> 3129.769
you know he's never gonna never gonna

3127.67 --> 3133.4300000000003
never gonna well here we are at your

3129.769 --> 3135.5589999999997
Neverland you know and so now they're

3133.43 --> 3138.68
encouraging me to return to the life I

3135.559 --> 3141.7690000000002
used to have you know one moment it's a

3138.68 --> 3145.279
problem and now it's now he's too much

3141.769 --> 3150.2889999999998
in our face you know so okay I don't

3145.279 --> 3153.589
know maybe there is maybe and guarantee

3150.289 --> 3157.279
be guaranteed but maybe there is a room

3153.589 --> 3162.6
for a middle road approach maybe you

3157.279 --> 3167.73
could maintain your faith your insight

3162.6 --> 3170.37
and not not let let your enthusiasm and

3167.73 --> 3174.36
the closeness of the bond you really

3170.37 --> 3177.54
have to your kin like force you to push

3174.36 --> 3179.67
that out to them let them be them but at

3177.54 --> 3186.39
the same time as you take that distance

3179.67 --> 3189.6
still use your insight to like lift up

3186.39 --> 3193.6099999999997
the veil a little here and there to them

3189.6 --> 3197.7799999999997
just in small ways like to carefully

3193.61 --> 3203.42
give them the opportunity to look beyond

3197.78 --> 3207.96
where there are at their closed system

3203.42 --> 3211.9500000000003
it's very careful process though but you

3207.96 --> 3215.82
know because I have said I have similar

3211.95 --> 3221.46
problems with my family and even come to

3215.82 --> 3223.7400000000002
that point that I have no had for

3221.46 --> 3227.25
example my brother I have no idea if he

3223.74 --> 3230.25
knows about any of this he even knows

3227.25 --> 3232.89
I'm doing YouTube because I don't talk

3230.25 --> 3236.15
to him ever and I think that I could

3232.89 --> 3241.41
probably never break flat earth to him

3236.15 --> 3243.859
like they're probably completely in the

3241.41 --> 3249.17
standard and everything maybe

3243.859 --> 3255.89
even evens modern liberals I fear I fear

3249.17 --> 3258.13
that would be the case but yeah it's

3255.89 --> 3261.499
just the next level of challenge and

3258.13 --> 3264.17
when I go back when I feel like okay I

3261.499 --> 3266.8089999999997
finally have the foundation to more

3264.17 --> 3270.89
physically reach out to to go there on

3266.809 --> 3272.42
visits again and be a representative of

3270.89 --> 3276.019
myself what I have become

3272.42 --> 3278.839
no longer the dwelling truck guy trying

3276.019 --> 3282.519
to escape the misery and everything

3278.839 --> 3287.18
which I definitely was for a long time

3282.519 --> 3290.0589999999997
then I can try to do it also like be

3287.18 --> 3294.529
playful with my insight and my knowledge

3290.059 --> 3297.559
and look I've already tested out in the

3294.529 --> 3300.7
field in the coffee shop in talking to

3297.559 --> 3303.8900000000003
people you can talk about everything

3300.7 --> 3305.66
including Flat Earth without talking

3303.89 --> 3308.749
about Flat Earth so if I can do that

3305.66 --> 3309.019
with all these people and they embrace

3308.749 --> 3312.6499999999996
it

3309.019 --> 3315.3799999999997
they embrace the energy of it then so

3312.65 --> 3317.7200000000003
might I be able to with my my brother

3315.38 --> 3321.829
for example and maybe he will actually

3317.72 --> 3324.7099999999996
understand it that it's like his allergy

3321.829 --> 3328.579
that he can't deal with psychologically

3324.71 --> 3332.9
but that I account for it and that we

3328.579 --> 3334.789
both bypassed that issue at least

3332.9 --> 3339.2000000000003
temporarily you know it might eventually

3334.789 --> 3343.4300000000003
come to a head anyway and just make him

3339.2 --> 3347.269
pop out and bump heads but at least I

3343.43 --> 3349.3999999999996
can try I've got like sort of a plan how

3347.269 --> 3352.5989999999997
to do that and maybe you could try

3349.4 --> 3352.599
something like that as well

3353.65 --> 3360.079
see I feel I don't know if you know if

3358.519 --> 3366.1699999999996
you know this you've read the scriptures

3360.079 --> 3370.309
but it compels you to to share it you

3366.17 --> 3374.329
know and it compels you to discuss it

3370.309 --> 3375.3190000000004
you know right you're not gonna what

3374.329 --> 3378.8590000000004
compels you

3375.319 --> 3383.299
does the scripture compel you art does

3378.859 --> 3383.8089999999997
simply the inner workings of you compel

3383.299 --> 3386.809
you

3383.809 --> 3391.94
that's the question I guess it's a I'm

3386.809 --> 3397.4900000000002
an unknown that compels me to question

3391.94 --> 3400.279
whether it's time to live in the blue in

3397.49 --> 3404.589
the sense of just keep my faith within

3400.279 --> 3408.289
me do what I do move on without it or to

3404.589 --> 3413.3289999999997
bring it up in the future you know and I

3408.289 --> 3416.349
don't know whether you know I've you

3413.329 --> 3420.4700000000003
know ten years now that I've had

3416.349 --> 3424.19
unbreakable immovable faith you know it

3420.47 --> 3429.769
was solidified already before 2014 but

3424.19 --> 3431.539
up to 2014 it was embodiment and you

3429.769 --> 3435.069
know there's not a day that goes by that

3431.539 --> 3437.96
I don't think that my words of verbatim

3435.069 --> 3443.66
recorded understood and noted you know

3437.96 --> 3449.299
and so I can and do not want to move

3443.66 --> 3451.8999999999996
away from that but you know the idea

3449.299 --> 3451.9
there

3452.31 --> 3458.67
I've never denied like every time I was

3456.3 --> 3462.4500000000003
asked do you believe was guarded yes you

3458.67 --> 3464.2200000000003
do you yes you know so it's like never

3462.45 --> 3467.1299999999997
once did I go I don't I don't I don't

3464.22 --> 3470.6299999999997
know I don't know so I've I've been

3467.13 --> 3474.0
asked the question so many times and

3470.63 --> 3476.6400000000003
every time was a yes absolutely

3474.0 --> 3478.11
of course I do you know right some Behar

3476.64 --> 3483.0
and then the question came do you still

3478.11 --> 3487.26
believe in God you know and it's it's

3483.0 --> 3490.29
like is that enough you know because if

3487.26 --> 3493.61
that's gonna be used against me and it's

3490.29 --> 3495.99
only going to worry them

3493.61 --> 3501.1200000000003
what is they're worried about you

3495.99 --> 3503.6099999999997
believing in God are you serious yeah it

3501.12 --> 3505.7999999999997
has a strange situation you know like I

3503.61 --> 3509.94
see it sounds routine I came out it

3505.8 --> 3514.5
verbalized my faith and had discussions

3509.94 --> 3518.13
you know put on some videos on YouTube

3514.5 --> 3520.35
and then my brother actually subscribed

3518.13 --> 3523.1400000000003
took the video he's getting to my cousin

3520.35 --> 3525.0899999999997
you know and said that set up a meeting

3523.14 --> 3526.95
with the shrink and Greece we're gonna

3525.09 --> 3529.2000000000003
take you down and you know they've got

3526.95 --> 3532.47
some medication for you and it's you

3529.2 --> 3537.71
know that is creepy yeah it's really

3532.47 --> 3537.7099999999996
creepy you know like and my brother

3538.36 --> 3543.25
oh there yeah and I wasn't hurting

3542.62 --> 3544.63
anybody

3543.25 --> 3546.99
you know what I mean I was living my

3544.63 --> 3550.54
life I was going to work I wasn't I

3546.99 --> 3552.79
wasn't doing anything wrong in in the

3550.54 --> 3557.07
sense of hurting them or hurting others

3552.79 --> 3561.07
but it's it's they couldn't they

3557.07 --> 3562.51
couldn't handle it and that's because I

3561.07 --> 3566.59
haven't I guess brought it up again

3562.51 --> 3567.6400000000003
since in their in a great capacity now

3566.59 --> 3569.08
he's over that now

3567.64 --> 3571.45
you know that was just a phase you know

3569.08 --> 3576.18
it's like none if anything it's

3571.45 --> 3578.5899999999997
strengthened you know right every day

3576.18 --> 3580.66
when I'm it's like meet faithful people

3578.59 --> 3582.34
that I've never met but I can see the

3580.66 --> 3584.47
energy of the words I know that this

3582.34 --> 3586.81
there's quite a piece of it to anything

3584.47 --> 3591.1299999999997
they understand and they probably just

3586.81 --> 3593.08
grinning you know mm-hmm you know I see

3591.13 --> 3597.87
where you are I know where you're at

3593.08 --> 3600.43
you know but it's like the idea that I

3597.87 --> 3605.5899999999997
had to be changed into what was

3600.43 --> 3608.19
acceptable is unacceptable right so yeah

3605.59 --> 3608.19
it is

3609.3 --> 3614.94
and yet when I make one comment about

3612.72 --> 3617.2799999999997
what they might be doing you live your

3614.94 --> 3619.65
own life do what you want you know it's

3617.28 --> 3622.6800000000003
like it's the moment you turn the mirror

3619.65 --> 3624.15
around you know that's me that's me I'm

3622.68 --> 3626.04
the marine that's me in the mirror you

3624.15 --> 3627.75
know moment you turn the mirror on there

3626.04 --> 3633.8
now this is you this is what you're

3627.75 --> 3635.4
doing can't handle it you know and so no

3633.8 --> 3642.8900000000003
it's crazy

3635.4 --> 3642.89
I hurt nobody do nothing you know and so

3642.92 --> 3651.89
yeah I just if my if my talk is not

3647.4 --> 3654.21
inciting violence or you know

3651.89 --> 3656.85
discrimination racism putting others

3654.21 --> 3660.3
down all this it's like it's my voice

3656.85 --> 3662.58
valid yes I do believe it is as much as

3660.3 --> 3667.9500000000003
other people's criticism and words are

3662.58 --> 3670.02
against me but it's almost like as long

3667.95 --> 3672.99
as you're underneath thing then I'm

3670.02 --> 3674.13
happy the moment you try to rise past me

3672.99 --> 3676.4399999999996
or next to me

3674.13 --> 3684.6600000000003
that's no you know that's unacceptable

3676.44 --> 3688.38
so yeah it's it's a crazy thing it's

3684.66 --> 3691.44
difficult yeah if there are fundamental

3688.38 --> 3695.34
atheists for their own personal reasons

3691.44 --> 3698.91
probably too yeah to hide behind going

3695.34 --> 3702.4500000000003
the left the left and path basically in

3698.91 --> 3705.7799999999997
their own way I don't know that the only

3702.45 --> 3709.6499999999996
thing you really can do is show that

3705.78 --> 3713.2200000000003
mirror to them and let their revolt and

3709.65 --> 3716.75
disgust come out because that's also a

3713.22 --> 3719.8799999999997
relief of the poison to them and look

3716.75 --> 3721.37
people that agree with them are not

3719.88 --> 3724.59
going to do that

3721.37 --> 3727.68
so you're may be the only opportunity

3724.59 --> 3730.23
for them to get a glimpse at what

3727.68 --> 3732.06
they're letting themselves become even

3730.23 --> 3732.81
though you can't actually change it for

3732.06 --> 3735.81
them you can

3732.81 --> 3739.5299999999997
yeah it's again lifting that fail just a

3735.81 --> 3743.52
little we be subtle be careful

3739.53 --> 3746.5800000000004
don't disturb their peace too much their

3743.52 --> 3748.89
peace for whatever it's worth but don't

3746.58 --> 3750.81
cut it off but by the way you you

3748.89 --> 3753.99
probably couldn't and you said it

3750.81 --> 3755.7599999999998
yourself like get that impulse you can't

3753.99 --> 3757.2
really hold it back it'll drive you nuts

3755.76 --> 3759.9900000000002
and you'll just have a fallout

3757.2 --> 3764.25
eventually if you try to but you can

3759.99 --> 3766.5499999999997
just carefully reflect that mirror for

3764.25 --> 3773.85
just for a moment you could even

3766.55 --> 3776.2400000000002
approach a discussion about God from a

3773.85 --> 3780.0899999999997
more technical philosophical standpoint

3776.24 --> 3782.16
lift out did talk about God without

3780.09 --> 3784.11
talking about God like talking about

3782.16 --> 3787.71
Flat Earth without talking about Flat

3784.11 --> 3790.8900000000003
Earth there's ways and you have so much

3787.71 --> 3794.58
knowledge so much depth in your wisdom

3790.89 --> 3798.0899999999997
in this I know you could do that I know

3794.58 --> 3800.88
you have that in you just have to trust

3798.09 --> 3805.4700000000003
that you'll do it right and that you'll

3800.88 --> 3807.6600000000003
learn in the process and yeah help fix

3805.47 --> 3813.6299999999997
some of the problems that they have and

3807.66 --> 3816.2599999999998
in that also help fix the relation

3813.63 --> 3816.26
between youth

3816.52 --> 3823.15
but it's not gonna be easy you know

3818.82 --> 3826.6600000000003
challenges never are it's just yeah it's

3823.15 --> 3828.089
like you could think from one inside of

3826.66 --> 3831.8199999999997
the you know one side of the equation

3828.089 --> 3834.339
its we just once what we just want what

3831.82 --> 3836.849
what is best for him we want you know we

3834.339 --> 3842.08
want him to be okay all the rest of it

3836.849 --> 3843.67
but when it's about pulling down

3842.08 --> 3845.83
everything that's positive in my life

3843.67 --> 3849.73
and making it difficult for me to get

3845.83 --> 3851.98
you know to where I want to go it

3849.73 --> 3856.3
doesn't seem like it's in my interest

3851.98 --> 3861.28
you know to me like it doesn't seem like

3856.3 --> 3864.7000000000003
it's for my best good you know it seems

3861.28 --> 3867.52
more from the from a point of jealousy a

3864.7 --> 3871.6899999999996
point of he's to free and I'll never be

3867.52 --> 3875.8
that free again I can't allow this I was

3871.69 --> 3882.19
always me you know it's it's it's like

3875.8 --> 3884.77
it's it's rough man it's it's crazy it's

3882.19 --> 3890.01
like I've never critiqued questioned

3884.77 --> 3896.849
asked fried Pro you know probed at any

3890.01 --> 3896.849
side of their lives before and it's

3897.71 --> 3907.119
the moment you know I I didn't I try

3901.609 --> 3913.3289999999997
that it's and this is you know that's

3907.119 --> 3913.329
it's difficult man let's say it's like

3914.079 --> 3920.569
yeah it's just interesting right well

3918.44 --> 3922.339
you know you know when you try it out

3920.569 --> 3926.119
when you start you're going to make

3922.339 --> 3930.2
mistakes things will potentially get out

3926.119 --> 3932.27
of hand it's it's inevitable but yeah

3930.2 --> 3936.4399999999996
from every step you can learn again and

3932.27 --> 3938.119
refine what you do so you know just

3936.44 --> 3944.079
seeing it see it as a learning process

3938.119 --> 3947.3900000000003
oh by the way thank you you don't know

3944.079 --> 3950.48

3967.22 --> 3972.89
yeah like I tried I tried the whole

3970.339 --> 3976.7599999999998
approach you know that I've been given

3972.89 --> 3979.7599999999998
and I tried that and because my points

3976.76 --> 3981.4700000000003
were on point because I was conscious

3979.76 --> 3983.829
about everything I was saying and it

3981.47 --> 3987.47
wasn't through any alcohol or anything

3983.829 --> 3990.17
they capped through and it was like now

3987.47 --> 3992.18
I'm the bad guy you know what I mean all

3990.17 --> 3996.44
you come running to be nasty again it's

3992.18 --> 4002.5299999999997
like no you know you come ready to

3996.44 --> 4005.53

you broke off I'm not gonna hurt you

4005.53 --> 4017.65
I'm just I was bitter yeah it was better

4010.27 --> 4022.54
when I wasn't so mm not so able to

4017.65 --> 4025.3
return reply because I never I never I

4022.54 --> 4027.849
never felt it was necessary to fight my

4025.3 --> 4032.849
own family you know I never never father

4027.849 --> 4035.44
was necessary to bad-mouth my family and

4032.849 --> 4038.92
my brother and his partner and

4035.44 --> 4040.96
everything and that mouse little that I

4038.92 --> 4044.53
realized that over the last three years

4040.96 --> 4047.53
there's been a fabrication of every

4044.53 --> 4052.5400000000004
single story to turn it against me to

4047.53 --> 4054.88
the point with it Wow you know my

4052.54 --> 4057.94
partner is apparently out with other

4054.88 --> 4059.56
guys and you know unfaithful never

4057.94 --> 4061.33
coming home because she's happy there

4059.56 --> 4063.7
she's got a sugar daddy and makes occur

4061.33 --> 4066.609
all of these things little do they know

4063.7 --> 4069.46
that I'm literally in constant contact

4066.609 --> 4072.97
with her all day long video calls and

4069.46 --> 4075.46
everything can well maybe you should

4072.97 --> 4077.589
maybe you should smack these kind of

4075.46 --> 4080.5
things right back in their face because

4077.589 --> 4085.02
that is just like nasty troll behavior

4080.5 --> 4088.42
that's that's unacceptable from family

4085.02 --> 4090.67
that's what I think like you know you

4088.42 --> 4094.92
know family you can push each other but

4090.67 --> 4098.2300000000005
when like there's real benign like real

4094.92 --> 4100.33
dark intentions should never do that

4098.23 --> 4102.339
toward your family so you should slap

4100.33 --> 4104.92
them in the face with it in my personal

4102.339 --> 4107.44
opinion when they do it you can be

4104.92 --> 4109.96
perfectly calm soon as they start that

4107.44 --> 4112.629999999999
it's like beating the snakes in the

4109.96 --> 4115.87
grass like as soon as you see it's like

4112.63 --> 4118.12
no you don't do that [ __ ] to your family

4115.87 --> 4121.69
are you see what you're doing this is

4118.12 --> 4123.3099999999995
pure poison yeah you know you can

4121.69 --> 4127.46
dislike me you can just like what I do

4123.31 --> 4132.77
but that is nobody should do that have

4127.46 --> 4132.77
am i you know

4133.449 --> 4142.5
you know I you know man it goes without

4136.839 --> 4147.8189999999995
saying that I trust my partner but it's

4142.5 --> 4151.109
it's it's the level at which I could

4147.819 --> 4154.2390000000005
attack it's the level at which I could

4151.109 --> 4160.509
just speak the truth ask actual

4154.239 --> 4163.44
questions that could seriously destroy

4160.509 --> 4167.52
you know all the progress that was made

4163.44 --> 4170.29
but without kind of doing something then

4167.52 --> 4174.969
you know I'm always gonna be in a

4170.29 --> 4177.79
certain level of well-seeming me a

4174.969 --> 4181.2390000000005
certain level of strength against their

4177.79 --> 4183.489
attacks but you know I've destroyed the

4181.239 --> 4184.7789999999995
fabrication in the last couple of weeks

4183.489 --> 4189.099999999999
that they've made over the last three

4184.779 --> 4195.160000000001
years by just simply showing what I

4189.1 --> 4200.370000000001
could but it's almost like the evil is

4195.16 --> 4205.15
too deep now like really do you think so

4200.37 --> 4207.34
it's deep man it's it's like and it

4205.15 --> 4211.48
comes to me it comes from a point of

4207.34 --> 4215.8
jealousy it's like this is growing out

4211.48 --> 4217.839999999999
of my hands like like I'm like this is

4215.8 --> 4222.6990000000005
serious I can feel it from you this is

4217.84 --> 4225.52
really serious and I'd have to like look

4222.699 --> 4227.889999999999
I have to see them I'd have to see a

4225.52 --> 4230.56
picture or see you talking to I'd have

4227.89 --> 4232.780000000001
to really get it because you're

4230.56 --> 4235.6900000000005
obviously having difficulty dealing with

4232.78 --> 4238.739
this and I don't think I can even

4235.69 --> 4241.178999999999
properly analyze the entire situation

4238.739 --> 4243.669999999999
from you just telling me about it

4241.179 --> 4248.62
because this seems very complex and

4243.67 --> 4251.8
multi-angle with your your emotional

4248.62 --> 4255.04
connection to them there's to yours the

4251.8 --> 4257.25
different view conflicts is it's getting

4255.04 --> 4260.44
really complicated I I don't know really

4257.25 --> 4263.11
how to advise you in one direction with

4260.44 --> 4264.879999999999
this because it could be that yeah what

4263.11 --> 4267.19
you say if it's gone that

4264.88 --> 4269.14
that poison that there's just nothing

4267.19 --> 4271.36
you can do but just walk away I don't

4269.14 --> 4274.990000000001
know I don't know if this is the case

4271.36 --> 4276.67
I'd have to look a little closer and see

4274.99 --> 4279.01
that's the thing it's not like a level

4276.67 --> 4283.66
of depression it's not like I'm so upset

4279.01 --> 4285.9400000000005
you know I'm my life is you know I'm I'm

4283.66 --> 4289.36
blessed to be alive I'm happy to be

4285.94 --> 4291.16
alive I'm you know I'm content in every

4289.36 --> 4292.54
other aspect of my life but my family

4291.16 --> 4296.26
has always mattered to me there's not a

4292.54 --> 4299.76
day that it didn't and it's it's just

4296.26 --> 4302.62
this unresolved piece that just gets

4299.76 --> 4307.33
harder and harder as you say to to

4302.62 --> 4309.5199999999995
decipher because no matter what goodness

4307.33 --> 4311.5
comes along it it's never enough you

4309.52 --> 4315.64
know it's never enough for them it's

4311.5 --> 4319.69
never good enough and it's it's toxic

4315.64 --> 4322.12
it's so it's so draining to be around

4319.69 --> 4324.28
because I've you know it's like but

4322.12 --> 4327.13
they're expecting you to flip around and

4324.28 --> 4328.509999999999
become dark they don't even understand

4327.13 --> 4330.82
probably but that's what they're

4328.51 --> 4333.67
demanding of you is basically through

4330.82 --> 4336.13
them through their void through their

4333.67 --> 4338.77
sealing of their consciousness of God

4336.13 --> 4342.31
and creation and everything they have

4338.77 --> 4344.8
become subject to this period of Ahriman

4342.31 --> 4348.1900000000005
talking through them basically asking

4344.8 --> 4353.320000000001
you to know you're so much in the light

4348.19 --> 4356.5599999999995
now drop it and become corrupted

4353.32 --> 4358.599999999999
basically so we can breathe again and

4356.56 --> 4360.55
not be blinded by the light it's

4358.6 --> 4364.47
completely subconscious how that works

4360.55 --> 4364.47
if it's really that far

4366.58 --> 4372.53
but a theist can do that to people okay

4370.01 --> 4374.84
yeah they can but always have to do with

4372.53 --> 4376.639999999999
money here you know I thought it was I

4374.84 --> 4379.04
thought it was to do with money because

4376.64 --> 4380.42
there was expectations in the past for a

4379.04 --> 4382.1
certain amount of money to come in a

4380.42 --> 4384.92
certain time and it didn't come and then

4382.1 --> 4388.400000000001
things got difficult and all the rest of

4384.92 --> 4392.02
it but it was only because the

4388.4 --> 4395.21
expectation was there that they you know

4392.02 --> 4397.43
there was no need to no need to worry no

4395.21 --> 4399.02
need to worry but then as that time

4397.43 --> 4401.6900000000005
ticked on and the money didn't come it

4399.02 --> 4404.81
was like oh no oh no and so I thought ah

4401.69 --> 4405.259999999999
this must just this must just be about

4404.81 --> 4406.820000000001
money

4405.26 --> 4410.780000000001
you know what I mean and when the money

4406.82 --> 4413.929999999999
finally came and everybody's life could

4410.78 --> 4416.66
be sorted I thought ah now we can all

4413.93 --> 4419.450000000001
relax you know now we can all relax

4416.66 --> 4422.24
because the money's there for the houses

4419.45 --> 4425.929999999999
of life the businesses the future it's

4422.24 --> 4432.32
all there and when they got the lion's

4425.93 --> 4435.530000000001
share it got the most evil it's ever

4432.32 --> 4439.099999999999
been alright it actually you know it

4435.53 --> 4445.88
weaponized them exactly and so now it's

4439.1 --> 4450.08
like it's it's like it's like it wasn't

4445.88 --> 4454.09
the stress it wasn't just the money you

4450.08 --> 4459.38
know it wasn't just it wasn't just that

4454.09 --> 4463.28
it's been an ongoing plan to just just I

4459.38 --> 4467.28
don't know like if I'm suffering there

4463.28 --> 4470.16
laughing you know

4467.28 --> 4473.73
if they can hinder me more and more than

4470.16 --> 4476.4
they're laughing about it you know right

4473.73 --> 4481.83
well and it doesn't matter like that I

4476.4 --> 4484.17
do it's it's like anything positive is

4481.83 --> 4486.57
actually a negative to them because it's

4484.17 --> 4488.46
positive for me right but they're

4486.57 --> 4493.469999999999
they're like stabbing me in the back

4488.46 --> 4499.1
while you're bleeding yeah you know and

4493.47 --> 4503.610000000001
it's it's it's just like you can imagine

4499.1 --> 4505.2300000000005
you had expectations and they didn't

4503.61 --> 4507.839999999999
work out I can't find any work out

4505.23 --> 4510.209999999999
life's like that but then you've got it

4507.84 --> 4514.2300000000005
all you've got it all now you don't have

4510.21 --> 4517.32
to worry another day in your life but

4514.23 --> 4521.79
you still coming at me you know you're

4517.32 --> 4524.639999999999
still attacking me labeling my partner

4521.79 --> 4531.12
calling her promiscuous label here a

4524.64 --> 4532.950000000001
[ __ ] you know and then getting into my

4531.12 --> 4536.16
father's mind and telling him all these

4532.95 --> 4538.17
things and and so now I'm bewildered and

4536.16 --> 4541.5
stupid and don't have a loyal partner

4538.17 --> 4543.45
and what am i doing and everything to

4541.5 --> 4547.65
hinder me from getting back to my love

4543.45 --> 4551.28
you know and you know it's it's

4547.65 --> 4555.57
ridiculous so there's enough for

4551.28 --> 4559.92
everyone you know and yeah but only if

4555.57 --> 4562.29
everyone knows it and accept it that's

4559.92 --> 4564.92
the whole deal I think yeah there is

4562.29 --> 4566.94
maybe a possibility where you could

4564.92 --> 4569.96
although it will be almost

4566.94 --> 4574.08
counterintuitive to you through your

4569.96 --> 4575.78
angle of approach to basically fight

4574.08 --> 4580.849
back

4575.78 --> 4582.829
like god this is so complicated [ __ ]

4580.849 --> 4583.88
like I was in this kind of [ __ ] when I

4582.829 --> 4586.869
was 15

4583.88 --> 4591.1990000000005
between my parents you know they were in

4586.869 --> 4594.86
brutal psychological fights not physical

4591.199 --> 4596.989
thank God although sometimes almost but

4594.86 --> 4599.869
brutal where they were just completely

4596.989 --> 4602.058999999999
bypassed it defied by past their

4599.869 --> 4604.429
conscious just bypassed their very

4602.059 --> 4607.13
conscious and I was dealing with

4604.429 --> 4610.369
entities and trying to work it out like

4607.13 --> 4616.55
having a battle between Devils that were

4610.369 --> 4618.139
inside my parents and I was the only one

4616.55 --> 4619.820000000001
that could actually communicate with

4618.139 --> 4621.679
these entities because I was the only

4619.82 --> 4625.219
one that actually understood how they

4621.679 --> 4627.559
worked it's so weird but what you could

4625.219 --> 4629.929
do what you could try although it's

4627.559 --> 4632.539
probably not gonna be your thing because

4629.929 --> 4635.3
yeah you're still gonna have to dig

4632.539 --> 4638.659
through the poison as you do it but yeah

4635.3 --> 4643.46
if they're attacking you so much maybe

4638.659 --> 4647.808999999999
you should consider counter striking by

4643.46 --> 4651.019
taking their [ __ ] and painfully shoving

4647.809 --> 4653.479
it in their face and you don't even need

4651.019 --> 4655.34
to put anything extra on top of it you

4653.479 --> 4658.789000000001
can leave your own ego completely out of

4655.34 --> 4661.3
it you know slap them with the truth

4658.789 --> 4665.059
they're gonna push you manipulate you

4661.3 --> 4667.249
then look like oh why don't you look at

4665.059 --> 4670.55
yourself right there what are you doing

4667.249 --> 4673.579
here or do you think that's going but

4670.55 --> 4676.729
yeah it is if you do that you will

4673.579 --> 4679.489
engage into psychological battle with

4676.729 --> 4683.499000000001
family and it's gonna always be heavy

4679.489 --> 4685.909
and it's probably gonna lead to a a

4683.499 --> 4688.36
energy collapse within the family one

4685.909 --> 4694.929
way or the other so you could try that

4688.36 --> 4694.929
or walk away and just let it settle

4695.63 --> 4703.71
yeah but yeah it's gonna be difficult

4699.9 --> 4706.4
either way because I can imagine they

4703.71 --> 4710.76
just feel like a curse on your family

4706.4 --> 4714.139999999999
it's the only aspect that can dock in

4710.76 --> 4717.66
the day you know I mean it's like keep

4714.14 --> 4722.43
asking within myself am I am I like

4717.66 --> 4727.01
doing it am i doing enough you know yeah

4722.43 --> 4727.01
it's hot it's because it's like I

4729.94 --> 4736.299999999999
I love loan I don't see you know as am i

4732.85 --> 4739.360000000001
doing enough it's more like is what I am

4736.3 --> 4743.35
doing effective in scenarios like this

4739.36 --> 4745.69
that is more important to ask because

4743.35 --> 4747.96
it's not about quantity it's about the

4745.69 --> 4752.98
quality it's about the angle of approach

4747.96 --> 4757.08
about the evolution of the spiritual

4752.98 --> 4762.239
interactions it's not about quantity

4757.08 --> 4762.239
it's about is it effective

4763.18 --> 4766.89
I would try to focus more on that

4769.099 --> 4777.59
but yeah like a feeling man it's heavy

4772.34 --> 4787.719
heavy [ __ ] yeah well my name does mean

4777.59 --> 4787.719
arduous but man it's like you know

4787.97 --> 4797.5
I get more Brotherhood from strangers

4793.31 --> 4799.76
than I do from my own brother you know

4797.5 --> 4806.02
it's like I always wonder like if your

4799.76 --> 4809.71
next scenario and it's like climbing and

4806.02 --> 4812.3
your brothers at the bottom and he cuts

4809.71 --> 4814.1
wood he cut the rope to save everybody

4812.3 --> 4815.39
else or would you just wait and take

4814.1 --> 4821.200000000001
everybody down with him

4815.39 --> 4828.7300000000005
you know it's that it's that whole I

4821.2 --> 4831.11
just yeah it's it's rough man because

4828.73 --> 4833.33
the light at the end of the tunnel was

4831.11 --> 4835.25
when he finally gets all this material

4833.33 --> 4837.29
game that he wants to get in then who

4835.25 --> 4839.6
think he'll calm down then he will

4837.29 --> 4843.62
appreciate what he's got then he'll give

4839.6 --> 4846.160000000001
back in it yeah doesn't know what hasn't

4843.62 --> 4854.15
like that it did what happen you know

4846.16 --> 4857.03
and it became like it became even more

4854.15 --> 4860.21
toxic right more toxic than I could even

4857.03 --> 4863.21
imagine and so underhanded and evil that

4860.21 --> 4865.04
the plans would be like he was like

4863.21 --> 4867.92
grinning to my face you know and him

4865.04 --> 4871.81
like speaking ill of me that day you

4867.92 --> 4877.58
know and it's just like wow it's like

4871.81 --> 4878.990000000001
what like like what would it take you

4877.58 --> 4881.18
know and then I spoke to one of his

4878.99 --> 4883.91
friends and he became my for a nice hit

4881.18 --> 4886.31
yeah we were as a step like what would

4883.91 --> 4890.72
it take it seems never to be enough and

4886.31 --> 4892.79
it's like a void you know it's like -

4890.72 --> 4895.79
I'd ask how could you do this to

4892.79 --> 4900.17
yourself look at what you're letting

4895.79 --> 4903.46
yourself become I mean do you know what

4900.17 --> 4903.46
you're doing yeah right now

4904.03 --> 4909.71
yeah you know even though even though my

4907.67 --> 4914.18
whole life has been put on trial and

4909.71 --> 4917.33
this use this used as a way to kind of

4914.18 --> 4919.400000000001
bring himself up and access the money

4917.33 --> 4921.44
that I should rightly be able to have so

4919.4 --> 4923.75
that I can leave the country I've got to

4921.44 --> 4926.62
put together all of these things to be

4923.75 --> 4931.06
able to do it you know and so it it's

4926.62 --> 4935.45
it's it was revealing to see how much

4931.06 --> 4939.080000000001
ill has been spoken of me when when it

4935.45 --> 4941.57
was you know unwarranted in in my

4939.08 --> 4943.3
opinion and in others opinion it's like

4941.57 --> 4946.88
nah you know it was like that's just

4943.3 --> 4949.91
nasty that's just dark and it's just

4946.88 --> 4951.35
like nobody nobody has an answer because

4949.91 --> 4954.38
they've never seen it before

4951.35 --> 4959.27
and they couldn't imagine it you know

4954.38 --> 4964.43
and it's just like man I'm fighting

4959.27 --> 4968.660000000001
three people with Vice at once you know

4964.43 --> 4973.6
and it it's truly dark you know it's

4968.66 --> 4973.599999999999
nasta sysm it's like

4974.159 --> 4979.71
as long as I'm the bottom then he would

4977.34 --> 4986.82
dance like a show monkey that's what he

4979.71 --> 4992.82
will do you know and yeah it's it's

4986.82 --> 4996.65
rough it's really rough because yeah I

4992.82 --> 5001.489
wouldn't wish it on anybody you know

4996.65 --> 5004.369
it's yeah I don't have time and I have

5001.489 --> 5008.69
time to critique other's lives you know

5004.369 --> 5010.25
in the sense of you know saying what

5008.69 --> 5013.5199999999995
they should do and all the rest of it

5010.25 --> 5017.329
but the only thing I question is is the

5013.52 --> 5020.2390000000005
mocking you know the the mocking and

5017.329 --> 5022.3099999999995
unfounded dismissal and disrespect of

5020.239 --> 5025.879999999999
the creator that's the one thing I

5022.31 --> 5029.889
question the wrist the wrist is up to

5025.88 --> 5035.32
you oh wait what they do you mean yeah

5029.889 --> 5035.32
and it's it's just like

5036.059 --> 5038.63
yeah I

5039.12 --> 5046.23
yeah I've

5041.13 --> 5050.04
I trusted a plan I've trusted a way you

5046.23 --> 5052.7699999999995
know I've trusted the the path in which

5050.04 --> 5054.119
I was told would be you know what I

5052.77 --> 5057.27
needed to do to get to where I'm going

5054.119 --> 5059.04
to the point where now I'm in a hole and

5057.27 --> 5062.55
I'm digging myself out because I can't

5059.04 --> 5065.909
trust I can't trust anybody but myself

5062.55 --> 5067.71
and my partner and you and I trust

5065.909 --> 5070.23
peanuts you know because these are

5067.71 --> 5074.01
people that have you know shout out to

5070.23 --> 5079.44
peanuts yeah indeed and it just it's

5074.01 --> 5081.09
just yeah it's like like I see it it's

5079.44 --> 5083.909
like the Brotherhood in the end the end

5081.09 --> 5086.79
and the feeling of like acceptance has

5083.909 --> 5089.07
come from outside of my family you know

5086.79 --> 5091.65
and I don't think that's how it's meant

5089.07 --> 5094.199
to be well that's a matter of

5091.65 --> 5097.888999999999
perspective though it is again look if

5094.199 --> 5101.219
the darkness is right then you can find

5097.889 --> 5104.31
the light somewhere else just as if the

5101.219 --> 5107.19
darkness would be growing around you

5104.31 --> 5109.4400000000005
then that may actually switch everything

5107.19 --> 5111.419999999999
around in a family not saying this is

5109.44 --> 5115.29
specifically the case with your family

5111.42 --> 5120.05
but that's how it works if somewhere

5115.29 --> 5124.139
darkness pops up then in the contrasting

5120.05 --> 5127.29
position light will be found it's how

5124.139 --> 5129.6900000000005
I've experienced it you know the land

5127.29 --> 5134.909
both sides like I have had like very

5129.69 --> 5138.0599999999995
tight family bonding periods where we as

5134.909 --> 5141.57
a family would be like criticised and

5138.06 --> 5144.7300000000005
opposed and all kinds of things gossiped

5141.57 --> 5148.159
about like between

5144.73 --> 5150.138999999999
like parents offs to fellow student that

5148.159 --> 5152.659
kind of thing like yeah we were like a

5150.139 --> 5156.349
gossip item sometimes and that would

5152.659 --> 5159.11
bring us more together but then as that

5156.349 --> 5161.09
kind of thing went away and we all were

5159.11 --> 5163.369
left to our devices that's when the

5161.09 --> 5167.03
division actually started up in the

5163.369 --> 5173.48
family itself and then and exploded so

5167.03 --> 5175.28
yeah it's the last time I did this you

5173.48 --> 5178.489
know when I was completely stable

5175.28 --> 5183.5
hurting nobody you know I was working

5178.489 --> 5187.07
for the family business and the I sent

5183.5 --> 5189.4
an email to my brother about about you

5187.07 --> 5192.139
know like because he was attacking me

5189.4 --> 5194.089999999999
about something and I said to him look

5192.139 --> 5195.559
you've got your whole life sorted out

5194.09 --> 5197.599
right now you've got your own house or

5195.559 --> 5199.6990000000005
you know I'm paying rent you've got you

5197.599 --> 5204.289
don't judge from me on a pedestal you

5199.699 --> 5208.848999999999
know he turned up to the office and he

5204.289 --> 5211.3
goes you know you see it to me we're

5208.849 --> 5211.3
gonna fight

5211.469 --> 5216.42
and I was like what he's like we're

5214.8 --> 5217.08
gonna fight myself I'm not gonna fight

5216.42 --> 5219.21
you Joe

5217.08 --> 5221.13
you're my brother and he said mind you

5219.21 --> 5224.93
better get if and ready and he takes his

5221.13 --> 5228.900000000001
jacket off and he comes towards me and

5224.93 --> 5231.4800000000005
even in this like sunlit office with the

5228.9 --> 5235.16
blinds open and the light coming in his

5231.48 --> 5238.259999999999
eyes turned into like pin dots you know

5235.16 --> 5241.05
mmm Annie Annie and I just put my hands

5238.26 --> 5245.01
at my side and he still punched me yeah

5241.05 --> 5247.9800000000005
right in the right in the liver you know

5245.01 --> 5254.16
what I forgot to the liver and just hit

5247.98 --> 5256.0199999999995
me bow back he broke his finger and you

5254.16 --> 5258.719
know and I just looked at him like you

5256.02 --> 5260.400000000001
happy any kind of like shook his head

5258.719 --> 5262.71
put his jacket on and I walked out the

5260.4 --> 5264.42
office it was about twenty minutes late

5262.71 --> 5267.51
he called me and he's like I'm sorry

5264.42 --> 5269.6
about that I'm sorry and I just I just

5267.51 --> 5272.87
stayed silent on the phone like wow

5269.6 --> 5276.54
that's you know what you like what hey

5272.87 --> 5279.0
you know I'll fight for my family that's

5276.54 --> 5281.64
not a problem but I'm not gonna punch my

5279.0 --> 5288.09
own him you know no I didn't do that

5281.64 --> 5290.1900000000005
isn't it's ridiculous and you know he's

5288.09 --> 5294.57
like I'll actually broke my finger and I

5290.19 --> 5296.759999999999
my god okay you know and then I just

5294.57 --> 5299.8099999999995
told him it's okay you did what you had

5296.76 --> 5302.6
to do it's okay

5299.81 --> 5305.820000000001
that's what you felt you needed to do

5302.6 --> 5307.410000000001
it's okay that's gonna no that's so

5305.82 --> 5309.679999999999
typical that you would do that but

5307.41 --> 5311.88
that's probably gonna aggravate things

5309.68 --> 5314.9800000000005
because

5311.88 --> 5317.13
look he's seeking conflict so every time

5314.98 --> 5319.718999999999
you prove to him that you are impervious

5317.13 --> 5327.219
it's probably just gonna agitate him

5319.719 --> 5330.219
even more yeah well you know I you just

5327.219 --> 5333.94
just saying you might consider just

5330.219 --> 5335.4890000000005
knowing you're impervious and not

5333.94 --> 5339.07
showing it after him

5335.489 --> 5343.48
because obviously that's gonna make

5339.07 --> 5348.07
things worse no I think what makes

5343.48 --> 5352.119
things worse is that he's bald two years

5348.07 --> 5352.719
two years older than me and I'm clearly

5352.119 --> 5357.79
not bald

5352.719 --> 5363.04
no no you know okay and he's a jealous

5357.79 --> 5368.67
of that well yeah when one of the

5363.04 --> 5368.67
conditions was cut my hair you know

5369.869 --> 5376.42
right that's cut my hair at least if

5374.71 --> 5377.7390000000005
there was less here wouldn't be so bad

5376.42 --> 5383.579
it's like you know what I'm just gonna

5377.739 --> 5386.879
keep growing it now you know

5383.579 --> 5389.478999999999
and it's just this

5386.879 --> 5389.479
like

5390.07 --> 5396.78
no no

5392.349 --> 5399.549
it's just no it's a level of

5396.78 --> 5402.429
contemplation that I keep relaying

5399.549 --> 5406.389
through my mind like what should I do

5402.429 --> 5409.599
should I should I even try like it's

5406.389 --> 5412.119
almost like there's no point to try

5409.599 --> 5415.209
because he doesn't want any relationship

5412.119 --> 5417.308999999999
with me as a brother he doesn't want to

5415.209 --> 5419.559
look out for me he wants to give lip

5417.309 --> 5422.319
service oh you know you know know that

5419.559 --> 5425.7390000000005
he deserved that yeah yeah yeah but he's

5422.319 --> 5433.169000000001
in the way of it you know so I don't

5425.739 --> 5435.999
know it's just it's so hard because it's

5433.169 --> 5440.379
and I was so fortunate and he can't see

5435.999 --> 5445.499
can't see them you know well then he's

5440.379 --> 5445.499
not really that fortunate yeah

5445.589 --> 5449.239
it's just yeah

5449.899 --> 5455.360000000001
so

5452.479 --> 5459.650000000001
yeah it's like every move I make is on

5455.36 --> 5462.289
trial under scrutiny and because I

5459.65 --> 5465.768999999999
haven't conformed and I'm not at that

5462.289 --> 5471.469
I'm not evil and I'm not I don't think

5465.769 --> 5474.320000000001
like that and you know I'm not I'm not

5471.469 --> 5478.55
looking to do to get the best you know

5474.32 --> 5480.259999999999
like no I don't know it's just like why

5478.55 --> 5484.1900000000005
haven't you got another woman yet you

5480.26 --> 5488.9490000000005
know type of thing no just like all of

5484.19 --> 5494.959
these things is because it's like I

5488.949 --> 5499.579
don't know like he can see how happy I

5494.959 --> 5502.039
am you know he knows how happy I am when

5499.579 --> 5508.67
I'm with my partner you knows I need

5502.039 --> 5512.079
nothing you know no jealousy versus once

5508.67 --> 5515.8
that you know exactly you might just be

5512.079 --> 5521.119
subconsciously jealous because he knows

5515.8 --> 5523.639
you got rewards for what you did while

5521.119 --> 5526.429
he did practically the exact opposite

5523.639 --> 5528.92
and he can never have that but the

5526.429 --> 5533.059
rewards that he got don't look so shiny

5528.92 --> 5535.67
no more which is what happens to a lot

5533.059 --> 5539.150000000001
of people that go the easy way for the

5535.67 --> 5542.179
big money and the the superficial Fame

5539.15 --> 5543.92
kind of thing they all get this you

5542.179 --> 5545.719
think oh they're so rich all the so

5543.92 --> 5547.999
glories know get to know them and you

5545.719 --> 5551.9890000000005
figure out that it means nothing to them

5547.999 --> 5554.449
not really they're just weaponizing it

5551.989 --> 5558.379999999999
to defend themselves somehow but it

5554.449 --> 5560.669999999999
doesn't actually bring them happiness or

5558.38 --> 5563.38
very little

5560.67 --> 5565.18
you know it's hard and I can understand

5563.38 --> 5569.35
that point of view but I can't

5565.18 --> 5572.650000000001
understand even contemplating like you

5569.35 --> 5575.59
know every little piece I guess what

5572.65 --> 5579.04
have been given it has not gone on gone

5575.59 --> 5583.39
unnoticed unappreciated you know it's

5579.04 --> 5585.43
like man you know it's like I could be

5583.39 --> 5587.59
this I could be that but I'm missing you

5585.43 --> 5591.4800000000005
know it's because of all these things I

5587.59 --> 5595.51
can do these things and it's it's just

5591.48 --> 5598.509999999999
boggles my mind just to even think

5595.51 --> 5601.74
having even more and not even being out

5598.51 --> 5601.74
of notice that it's it's

5608.409 --> 5615.018999999999
right heavy stuff

5612.439 --> 5619.4890000000005
really putting your heart out there here

5615.019 --> 5623.51
on my show certainly a big dilemma

5619.489 --> 5624.978999999999
you're facing and yeah I hope I did I'm

5623.51 --> 5626.9890000000005
gonna round out the show by the way

5624.979 --> 5628.999000000001
because yeah go it for a while but yeah

5626.989 --> 5631.129999999999
it's hard not gonna break that off in

5628.999 --> 5634.519
the middle of it because it's important

5631.13 --> 5637.729
that you talk about this or you wouldn't

5634.519 --> 5641.929
have brought it up yet but yeah I I'd be

5637.729 --> 5648.05
very careful remember the advice I gave

5641.929 --> 5653.9890000000005
you and ya know that I it seems very

5648.05 --> 5657.860000000001
difficult and yeah you can try to like

5653.989 --> 5661.188999999999
fight your way towards him somehow or

5657.86 --> 5667.728999999999
the rest of your family or really just

5661.189 --> 5670.639
say now what I got is too good to to be

5667.729 --> 5674.900000000001
poisoned in some way just to try and get

5670.639 --> 5679.150000000001
something back and walk away as soon as

5674.9 --> 5684.888999999999
possible I I don't know I I can't tell

5679.15 --> 5688.579
for sure but yeah it sounds pretty

5684.889 --> 5691.939
brutal I guess you know if I were in

5688.579 --> 5696.619
that position with who I am I would walk

5691.939 --> 5699.9490000000005
away but that's me and I have different

5696.619 --> 5704.679
abilities and strengths as you do so I

5699.949 --> 5704.678999999999
can't make that judgment call already

5704.93 --> 5715.1
yeah maybe I'll maybe maybe by accepting

5709.23 --> 5720.419999999999
that I can't do anymore maybe maybe that

5715.1 --> 5723.6
will bring like a realization and them

5720.42 --> 5724.26
to be like well Reese isn't there

5723.6 --> 5726.42
anymore

5724.26 --> 5729.18
you know Reese isn't like that anymore

5726.42 --> 5731.4890000000005
maybe maybe they'll be out acknowledged

5729.18 --> 5734.88
what I what I tried you know I try to

5731.489 --> 5738.929999999999
just give tried to be a son you tried to

5734.88 --> 5740.7300000000005
be a brother right now and well that's

5738.93 --> 5742.83
no I think there's a funny thing about

5740.73 --> 5746.19
thank you sorry take a few days away

5742.83 --> 5752.01
with least a week now I'll come back on

5746.19 --> 5759.058999999999
your show Alan you've given me a lot to

5752.01 --> 5762.150000000001
think about and I think

5759.059 --> 5766.969
I think I I need to I need to process it

5762.15 --> 5770.429
again like the first time yeah because

5766.969 --> 5773.25
it only became apparent of how bad the

5770.429 --> 5776.639
situation was when I realized that it

5773.25 --> 5781.949
was affecting my own mother to tears you

5776.639 --> 5784.789
know and yeah I I I'm going to go and

5781.949 --> 5789.138999999999
see you next week for her birthday and

5784.789 --> 5791.429
it's gonna be good but yeah I think I

5789.139 --> 5797.849
think I'm just gonna be listening in the

5791.429 --> 5801.59
background right okay that's okay that's

5797.849 --> 5805.02
okay so I appreciate I appreciate that

5801.59 --> 5808.409000000001
you taking the time to listen to me you

5805.02 --> 5810.9800000000005
know I trust your I trust your judgment

5808.409 --> 5816.409
I trust your heart trust your faith I

5810.98 --> 5816.409
feel that you know

5816.44 --> 5821.9
you were listening without a doubt and

5818.989 --> 5829.218999999999
you were able to to feel what I'm going

5821.9 --> 5831.379999999999
through but it's yeah I think now now I

5829.219 --> 5833.69
just need to you know you've given me a

5831.38 --> 5836.75
bit of clarity that it's not an easy

5833.69 --> 5838.5199999999995
situation you know it's not a it's not a

5836.75 --> 5841.429
simple matter there's a dark situation

5838.52 --> 5843.650000000001
yeah it's not like a simple matter an

5841.429 --> 5849.7300000000005
obvious choice you have overlooked or

5843.65 --> 5849.73
anything it's just a heavy situation

5851.739 --> 5857.169999999999
and as this you know this might be the

5853.69 --> 5860.65
this might be the price for following

5857.17 --> 5863.28
God you know well it doesn't seem like a

5860.65 --> 5867.25
test that's that's how it comes across

5863.28 --> 5869.92
to me you know yeah if you do things

5867.25 --> 5875.05
right you will be tested

5869.92 --> 5879.219
you will be yeah I I entered this call

5875.05 --> 5881.2300000000005
you know with the hope that this was the

5879.219 --> 5884.2
you know this was the this is the right

5881.23 --> 5887.259999999999
thing to do to kind of get some clarity

5884.2 --> 5889.42
and right as the end when you were

5887.26 --> 5894.81
talking about it that's when it came to

5889.42 --> 5897.64
realize yes okay so that is you know

5894.81 --> 5902.71
that is what I have to do you know that

5897.64 --> 5909.070000000001
is how you have to carry on or walk away

5902.71 --> 5911.5
and but yeah it's just that I'm just

5909.07 --> 5914.38
hearing it from someone else it's better

5911.5 --> 5918.64
than just going around and around in my

5914.38 --> 5920.62
own head you know yeah yeah because yeah

5918.64 --> 5925.93
I know yeah it can't even explain why

5920.62 --> 5927.82
but yeah this kind of heavy thing where

5925.93 --> 5931.3
you're in the middle of it and you can't

5927.82 --> 5934.0599999999995
really escape it yeah that's the best

5931.3 --> 5939.610000000001
time to talk it through with somebody

5934.06 --> 5943.3
else and just try to reflect some about

5939.61 --> 5946.53
it to see if an extra pair of eyes and

5943.3 --> 5948.02
an extra consciousness can help you find

5946.53 --> 5951.53
yeah

5948.02 --> 5953.330000000001
a more viable ground or options you've

5951.53 --> 5955.34
overlooked it's very important because

5953.33 --> 5959.15
yeah if you keep this all to yourself it

5955.34 --> 5961.01
can drive you nuts I can break you it's

5959.15 --> 5963.53
very heavy you know is it yeah you can

5961.01 --> 5965.570000000001
always agree with this outright but when

5963.53 --> 5967.88
you put your words up for scrutiny

5965.57 --> 5971.74
that's that's when you can take another

5967.88 --> 5974.33
angle and or come to an agreement and I

5971.74 --> 5978.92
feel that you very much helped me to do

5974.33 --> 5983.2699999999995
that tonight today so I'm very glad if I

5978.92 --> 5987.9800000000005
did I hope you you get through this this

5983.27 --> 5991.09
test and I think you will that's good

5987.98 --> 5991.089999999999
faith in you so

5991.989 --> 5997.12
well

5993.85 --> 6001.89
I'm gonna go for a walk now and go and

5997.12 --> 6006.75
pray thank you for this conversation

6001.89 --> 6009.6
thank you for thank God for allowing you

6006.75 --> 6014.01
to be in this world and the same goes

6009.6 --> 6016.200000000001
for you yes and I appreciate everybody

6014.01 --> 6022.16
on your panel who stuck around and

6016.2 --> 6025.97
listened and I really appreciate it and

6022.16 --> 6029.19
that's why I feel now after such a

6025.97 --> 6032.280000000001
conversation that seeing my face again

6029.19 --> 6036.57
soon might be detrimental to your show

6032.28 --> 6040.2
but well we'll see what happens you know

6036.57 --> 6042.98
did this entire situation may drag on a

6040.2 --> 6046.5599999999995
while for you or it may suddenly

6042.98 --> 6050.549999999999
resolved like unexpectedly quick you

6046.56 --> 6053.76
never really know you know and God

6050.55 --> 6057.18
doesn't make things that obvious you

6053.76 --> 6061.52
never really know so yeah it'll be all

6057.18 --> 6061.52
right you you just take your time and

6062.09 --> 6068.939
and we'll see where it goes from here

6065.939 --> 6072.539000000001
oh well hey thank you so much your show

6068.939 --> 6077.070000000001
is moving forward and again thank you

6072.539 --> 6082.53
for everybody it was listening you know

6077.07 --> 6084.57
and it wasn't too much for you yeah too

6082.53 --> 6086.789
much for some I'll guarantee it it was

6084.57 --> 6090.63
too much for some this is very heavy

6086.789 --> 6094.499
very personal very up close this is not

6090.63 --> 6097.439
your general Flat Earth debate glover

6094.499 --> 6098.849
trying to fool flatter through Flat

6097.439 --> 6100.409000000001
Earth or smacking globe or because

6098.849 --> 6102.329
that's much more easy much more

6100.409 --> 6104.549999999999
straightforward this is just the serious

6102.329 --> 6106.768999999999
heavy [ __ ] where it really touches

6104.55 --> 6107.429
people where they're not used to being

6106.769 --> 6110.179
touched

6107.429 --> 6113.869
so yeah but it doesn't matter because

6110.179 --> 6113.869
it's important

6114.44 --> 6119.98
and I'm glad that they will help you

6116.72 --> 6123.8
with that and give you the opportunity I

6119.98 --> 6126.349999999999
can now I can now no you know

6123.8 --> 6128.93
subconsciously and consciously that I've

6126.35 --> 6132.650000000001
had I have told you I have told

6128.93 --> 6134.66
something yes you're not and I was

6132.65 --> 6138.259999999999
prepared for any answer that you may

6134.66 --> 6142.19
give me like you know then and I think

6138.26 --> 6144.2300000000005
that's that's the beauty of it and yeah

6142.19 --> 6147.44
you know a lot of the problems in life

6144.23 --> 6150.139999999999
come from you know money and stress when

6147.44 --> 6153.86
there's no worry about money and they're

6150.14 --> 6156.38
still stressed and that's when it had to

6153.86 --> 6159.2
be questioned like what what is the

6156.38 --> 6161.24
motive what is what is the drive you

6159.2 --> 6164.66

6177.95 --> 6184.37
close look at things that are just

6179.72 --> 6187.58
really important to you and give them an

6184.37 --> 6192.2
opportunity to look into into the depths

6187.58 --> 6196.24
of somebody's world and learn from it as

6192.2 --> 6196.24

6234.65 --> 6239.629999999999
topics come and and whatever I'm on the

6236.9 --> 6244.5199999999995

Oh Evvie

6261.829 --> 6272.0
family relations family complications

6266.77 --> 6273.9490000000005
family polarizations things that usually

6272.0 --> 6276.11
don't get more tense than that an

6273.949 --> 6278.71
individual it's very tough to deal with

6276.11 --> 6281.71
these kind of things if if you have it

6278.71 --> 6281.71
so
