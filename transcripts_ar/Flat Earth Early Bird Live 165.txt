[Music]

39.69 --> 48.608999999999995
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.629 --> 53.949
early-bird number 165 I'm your host

48.609 --> 56.35
Arwen and before I start please don't

53.949 --> 58.18
forget to share the show and subscribe

56.35 --> 59.679
to my channel if you haven't already and

58.18 --> 62.979
hit the bell notification so you know

59.679 --> 73.36
when I'm going live which is usually 2

62.979 --> 75.97
p.m. Amsterdam time so today it's not as

73.36 --> 79.14
warm as yesterday it's kind of nice it's

75.97 --> 83.59
a bit cloudy oh yeah very funny

79.14 --> 85.929
there was rain yesterday evening pretty

83.59 --> 90.33
lot of rain so everything looks at just

85.929 --> 90.33
slightly more green and

95.47 --> 110.35
oh yeah the blossom from that tree then

99.16 --> 113.53
there's Obot gone much bit windy I tried

110.35 --> 117.66
to do some groceries on my bike but it

113.53 --> 121.18
got a little bit chilly here in there

117.66 --> 125.56
but still very nice so how is everyone

121.18 --> 127.84
doing sorry for being five minutes late

125.56 --> 130.66
I couldn't step away from Owen

127.84 --> 134.5
Benjamin's hang out with David wiser was

130.66 --> 136.21
very good I really liked the frequency

134.5 --> 142.18
they were talking on I really liked what

136.21 --> 144.25
David Weiss was reaching for and exactly

142.18 --> 150.1
like I expected there was just the

144.25 --> 152.32
typical disk-based thinking which was

150.1 --> 155.5
very advanced it's like he's really

152.32 --> 157.63
thinking about that's like his model the

155.5 --> 159.34
way like I've adopted the rectangular

157.63 --> 162.73
looping model concept and everything

159.34 --> 168.97
tying into that seems to like really be

162.73 --> 173.58999999999997
focusing on that and we'll see but it

168.97 --> 176.16
was so good yeah that for fit the last

173.59 --> 176.16
five minutes

176.96 --> 183.38
mm-hmm and brought up some very

181.49 --> 186.53
interesting points here and there as

183.38 --> 190.46
well and I kind of wanted to address

186.53 --> 192.61
what so many things that I lost track I

190.46 --> 198.92000000000002
I should have probably made a list but

192.61 --> 201.74
also saw pieces that hoary and dual

198.92 --> 205.54999999999998
streamed it basically he live streamed

201.74 --> 209.48000000000002
the live stream it was funny

205.55 --> 212.02
looked pretty good alright so hello ego

209.48 --> 212.01999999999998
splendor

216.55 --> 224.29000000000002
when a conversation that start Fyodor

219.3 --> 226.42000000000002
Dostoevsky complaining about talking

224.29 --> 230.31
about Owen Benjamin apparently doesn't

226.42 --> 230.30999999999997
like Owen Benjamin very much

230.58 --> 240.3
righteous force brand em Robert cats

234.04 --> 244.44
apiece Daniel Peter fondly 1 over mu KU

240.3 --> 244.44
drunken bullet for one one

248.87 --> 262.639
stares Moretz James Mason but he says

255.07 --> 270.32
they read leb truthers truth Hanna Dean

262.639 --> 273.01
well peanuts Clark Rambo Jambo hello so

270.32 --> 273.01
full house

282.97 --> 288.67
oh okay oh sorry well we are talking

287.23 --> 290.62
about him because he is definitely

288.67 --> 292.78000000000003
getting into the flat earth realm we

290.62 --> 295.48
touched upon it he's gradually getting

292.78 --> 299.59
into it's very obvious and he is very

295.48 --> 304.24
popular and he really has a good feel

299.59 --> 307.81
for his audience and he said gee he's a

304.24 --> 310.18
brilliant comedian in my opinion like

307.81 --> 316.39
really good and he's totally up my alley

310.18 --> 319.53000000000003
like the way he jokes around is how me

316.39 --> 324.66999999999996
and my brother used to fool around in

319.53 --> 326.95
our teen times and it's just it's

324.67 --> 332.62
hitting a special snare for me I love

326.95 --> 334.53999999999996
that [ __ ] like doing things that I want

332.62 --> 336.16
back then it was like in the liberal

334.54 --> 337.63
culture that we were all used to like

336.16 --> 339.67
you oh you weren't supposed to do that

337.63 --> 346.56
there was naughty so we did it anyway

339.67 --> 351.19
and make like real areas and ridiculous

346.56 --> 353.47
fantasy jokes surrounding like anything

351.19 --> 357.96999999999997
you wouldn't be able to talk about like

353.47 --> 361.81
racist remarks about things and but

357.97 --> 364.57000000000005
still looking into it every time like

361.81 --> 367.62
where you get to see superficial news

364.57 --> 372.45
things and stupid remarks from people

367.62 --> 378.22
but yeah we we were relatively isolated

372.45 --> 382.40999999999997
so I don't know there was a lot I didn't

378.22 --> 385.93
know about in the world other racists

382.41 --> 387.66900000000004
you could call it all though yeah sort

385.93 --> 388.3
of in a way I was considered a

387.669 --> 390.15999999999997
mixed-race

388.3 --> 393.18
but I never really experienced it like

390.16 --> 396.64000000000004
that I always feel like okay yeah I am

393.18 --> 399.88
really white but there's definitely

396.64 --> 403.34999999999997
traces of other stuff but that is kind

399.88 --> 405.59
of like what the Spanish are as well as

403.35 --> 408.8
I've learned it

405.59 --> 412.42999999999995
and I do consider them to be very

408.8 --> 419.47
special people very interesting

412.43 --> 425.12
characters and abilities talents and

419.47 --> 428.6
characteristics so anyway yeah we've

425.12 --> 430.97
joked about that kind of thing a lot and

428.6 --> 433.82000000000005
always did keep it very much a secret we

430.97 --> 436.37
would never like out in the open and

433.82 --> 439.729
salt people or anything but we would

436.37 --> 443.9
like snicker joke around about our silly

439.729 --> 445.82
weird stuff and and this we have oh one

443.9 --> 448.46
kind of does that in the open and it

445.82 --> 451.19
does it some very eloquently so I could

448.46 --> 455.71999999999997
totally respect that so it's personal I

451.19 --> 457.79
personally like him a lot and I don't

455.72 --> 459.97900000000004
agree with everything he says I think he

457.79 --> 465.47
kind of takes things a little bit too

459.979 --> 469.01
far but he's not doing it just to be

465.47 --> 475.36
blunt he does actually try to back up

469.01 --> 475.36
he's really he's like digging digging

478.17 --> 483.55
I'm thinking for the goods digging for

480.85 --> 488.59000000000003
the real gems and he's just trying out

483.55 --> 490.96000000000004
spots and pushing pushing the edge and I

488.59 --> 493.39
like that and he yeah it does it with

490.96 --> 495.84999999999997
purpose not just randomly not just be

493.39 --> 499.28999999999996
noisy or anything it's just I don't know

495.85 --> 502.05
it's hard to describe a good comedian so

499.29 --> 504.25
yeah and it's just interesting that he's

502.05 --> 507.73
actually dealing with Flat Earth and

504.25 --> 513.42
also seeing the the comedy potential of

507.73 --> 516.1
it which it does have many ways if not

513.42 --> 518.3499999999999
more mostly from the psychological angle

516.1 --> 523.4200000000001
the misconceptions the typical responses

518.35 --> 526.24
and it's an interesting region for

523.42 --> 529.36
character study because people have yeah

526.24 --> 533.62
show all kinds of mechons psychological

529.36 --> 537.7
mechanisms when they deal with flat

533.62 --> 541.75
earthers or ballers and tight flat

537.7 --> 544.6600000000001
earthers so yeah I totally get it he's

541.75 --> 547.02
really good for it and I get the

544.66 --> 549.8199999999999
enthusiasm and now he's done this

547.02 --> 557.04
interview with with David Weiss and it

549.82 --> 560.4100000000001
was really good and that will have a

557.04 --> 563.11
like a resonating effect that will touch

560.41 --> 565.93
a lot of people that will kind of find

563.11 --> 569.83
courage to see the energy subtly look at

565.93 --> 572.8299999999999
it under a guise of protection of

569.83 --> 575.71
something that they trust that's how it

572.83 --> 579.3100000000001
works sometimes people like on the edge

575.71 --> 582.22
or doubting will then like you know what

579.31 --> 584.7399999999999
this guy sounds really interesting I

582.22 --> 586.74
don't agree with everything but he seems

584.74 --> 589.9
to be a really good guy he's pretty

586.74 --> 593.14
focused there I don't find it like and

589.9 --> 597.63
really focused not no screwing around

593.14 --> 597.63
like liberals really

598.48 --> 603.59
except like I don't know when alcohol is

601.1 --> 605.6
involved that like when it's a bro-bro

603.59 --> 609.44
situation they may may get a little

605.6 --> 611.21
crazy but in general in a public

609.44 --> 614.1500000000001
scenario and normal scenario they're

611.21 --> 617.1800000000001
just really decent and sharp people and

614.15 --> 621.38
that's how we want to be presented

617.18 --> 625.2199999999999
that's alluring that's that forces of

621.38 --> 628.31
natural respect so David wise was

625.22 --> 630.95
excellent I love the deep respect for it

628.31 --> 635.7399999999999
always have though I don't disagree I

630.95 --> 642.2
disagree with some cosmogony related

635.74 --> 646.67
principles and I think we're not very

642.2 --> 650.21
good at disagreeing with on another it's

646.67 --> 654.1999999999999
just I've tried it a couple of times and

650.21 --> 656.7800000000001
just kind of clashes like it's almost

654.2 --> 663.1700000000001
like I accidentally really hurt him and

656.78 --> 665.66
I don't mean to I'm just it's like

663.17 --> 669.4399999999999
sparring it's like we're in full armor

665.66 --> 675.23
and weaponry mentally so I just

669.44 --> 678.59
challenged him for a well a friendly

675.23 --> 682.52
duel like that and I use everything I

678.59 --> 686.08
got just the show like yeah I'm a small

682.52 --> 688.55
guy but look what I can do and he I

686.08 --> 694.5500000000001
don't know I do it kind of interruptive

688.55 --> 697.0699999999999
because he does if it tries to insert a

694.55 --> 699.5899999999999
story that it's just the way he does it

697.07 --> 703.6
is works really well normally but I'm

699.59 --> 703.6
much more directed and I don't know just

703.96 --> 708.0400000000001
so for any friction that I've may have

706.51 --> 717.63
caused in the past I'm sorry about that

708.04 --> 720.01
David Weiss would be really good to see

717.63 --> 723.67
ya I don't know we're working that out

720.01 --> 726.399
and really establishing these cosmic

723.67 --> 729.13
conical differences maybe it can help

726.399 --> 735.029
you understand more of what I'm focusing

729.13 --> 737.5889999999999
on the overarching ways of thinking

735.029 --> 740.95
maybe that's just really difficult I

737.589 --> 745.2090000000001
don't know for me it is not difficult

740.95 --> 748.32
it's become it's not instinctive as much

745.209 --> 751.2399999999999
as it is just I'm so used to doing that

748.32 --> 754.4100000000001
since I was young that just comes

751.24 --> 754.41
natural now

762.25 --> 771.14
anyway hmm yeah good stuff Owen Benjamin

766.42 --> 772.7299999999999
having gays David Wysong so if you

771.14 --> 775.42
haven't seen that I definitely recommend

772.73 --> 775.4200000000001
you watch it

782.01 --> 786.65
let's see okay let me look in check

787.12 --> 790.259
[Music]

795.99 --> 805.64
let's see B now now you get an taeju

802.08 --> 812.01
text that's that's hilarious

805.64 --> 816.24
look Owen Benjamin doesn't he knows how

812.01 --> 819.78
to manage his jokes like he wasn't

816.24 --> 823.05
getting like totally anti Jew joke ish

819.78 --> 826.14
with David wise even though I did make a

823.05 --> 828.75
joke once like yeah he like he's

826.14 --> 832.1999999999999
supposed to beat you and of course I

828.75 --> 833.82
make that joke too it's just funny like

832.2 --> 836.4200000000001
he comes from a Jew family but he's

833.82 --> 843.12
another practitioner basically

836.42 --> 843.7199999999999
definitely not a tell motifs and yeah

843.12 --> 848.94
that's it

843.72 --> 851.46
so he's not gonna like rub his Jew jokes

848.94 --> 856.2
off on flat earthers that's just his

851.46 --> 858.99
thing unless yeah the flat earthers

856.2 --> 861.4200000000001
totally go into that like if for example

858.99 --> 862.59
not that this is probably gonna happen

861.42 --> 865.86
oh who knows

862.59 --> 868.2900000000001
that he would have like vegan [ __ ] on or

865.86 --> 872.5500000000001
something yeah what do you think is

868.29 --> 874.11
gonna happen but right but that's

872.55 --> 878.6099999999999
because we can go ahead with just

874.11 --> 880.5600000000001
full-on dive into that I think that yeah

878.61 --> 883.11
it all depends on the person he's not

880.56 --> 885.42
just gonna push that [ __ ] onto people

883.11 --> 888.47
he's not like that at all

885.42 --> 888.4699999999999
it's very careful

899.779 --> 912.98
right huh Nadine yeah Mandela effect

904.529 --> 917.1899999999999
well it's complicated I think that a lot

912.98 --> 921.57
is psychological and I'm really glad

917.19 --> 924.75
that own Benjamin is catching on to that

921.57 --> 929.279
as well is that sometimes products are

924.75 --> 931.32
being like written in a way that's kind

929.279 --> 933.89
of out of place it's done on purpose

931.32 --> 939.019
it's like an agitation tactic and then

933.89 --> 942.029
even it's encouraged to then say it to

939.019 --> 944.37
make oh everyone that says it and not

942.029 --> 945.959
necessarily even a direct advertisement

944.37 --> 948.87
where it's spoken but make radio

945.959 --> 951.81
announcers typically say it wrong just

948.87 --> 955.67
let them or they may naturally do this

951.81 --> 959.899
because it just reads wrong in a way and

955.67 --> 962.269
then yeah everybody starts to

959.899 --> 965.67
phonetically remember it the wrong way

962.269 --> 968.94
the way you would typically naturally

965.67 --> 971.31
want to see that word but it would have

968.94 --> 976.5500000000001
always been the wrong way

971.31 --> 980.91
see like Baron berenstain bears that

976.55 --> 984.0889999999999
it's a it's it's a knee as the own

980.91 --> 989.51
Benjamin calls it it's a sneaky annoying

984.089 --> 989.5100000000001
trick the [ __ ] with you [ __ ] your head

993.95 --> 999.48
that's definitely big parts of the

997.68 --> 1001.28
Mandela effect and all of the typical

999.48 --> 1016.1800000000001
things on the list

1001.28 --> 1016.18
definitely yeah as for

1021.5 --> 1030.53
I don't know it's like changing things

1026.839 --> 1033.74
in time how does that even work if they

1030.53 --> 1036.079
would technically be able to do that how

1033.74 --> 1038.209
would that work how are they doing that

1036.079 --> 1041.6
there's litigating you go to another

1038.209 --> 1045.47
dimension of the previous time and do

1041.6 --> 1048.62
[ __ ] orders like a continuous portal or

1045.47 --> 1052.04
I just walk back and forth in a in a

1048.62 --> 1058.25
parallel timeline gate with another

1052.04 --> 1060.59
period how would that even work or is it

1058.25 --> 1065.93
just something like an instantaneous

1060.59 --> 1068.53
thing like a matrix reset how would I

1065.93 --> 1068.53
even work

1071.99 --> 1078.34
and to have these small changes it seems

1075.5 --> 1084.14
so excessive the small changes is

1078.34 --> 1086.6789999999999
because we regard them as small changes

1084.14 --> 1092.539
seem like oh yeah that should be doable

1086.679 --> 1095.27
but yeah what makes it but makes it easy

1092.539 --> 1098.24
for the small changes why is that easy

1095.27 --> 1101.6589999999999
well then we would probably think okay a

1098.24 --> 1105.86
matrix setup small changes minimum

1101.659 --> 1106.3700000000001
energy exchange or whatever how that

1105.86 --> 1110.149
works

1106.37 --> 1115.549
okay matrix theory so the Mandela effect

1110.149 --> 1118.039
really weaves into the matrix theory by

1115.549 --> 1120.789
how it how it's supposed to function the

1118.039 --> 1120.789
concept and

1125.73 --> 1127.76
I

1132.29 --> 1136.61
[Music]

1134.51 --> 1139.84
so unless they have some kind of gateway

1136.61 --> 1144.77
devices to interact with other times

1139.84 --> 1148.52
maybe they do they the ones that are

1144.77 --> 1152.57
capable of using this or maybe it's

1148.52 --> 1156.1299999999999
hitter and hidden indeed in the dark

1152.57 --> 1156.1299999999999
world know what

1166.789 --> 1174.979
and I don't know technically even from

1171.739 --> 1178.07
interacting different times if there

1174.979 --> 1181.039
would be like a parallel gate direct

1178.07 --> 1183.619
open interaction between Continuum's

1181.039 --> 1187.129
then technically nothing you could ever

1183.619 --> 1189.109
do this is all purely time-travel

1187.129 --> 1193.809
theoretics that nothing you could ever

1189.109 --> 1197.1689999999999
do in the past could alter what happens

1193.809 --> 1202.94
because there is a continuous opening

1197.169 --> 1208.779
well if you would teleport to another

1202.94 --> 1211.519
era then technically it splits up so

1208.779 --> 1214.129
where you teleported from simply does

1211.519 --> 1216.499
not have the Telep the time traveler

1214.129 --> 1219.799
within it anymore and nothing ever

1216.499 --> 1223.179
changes because they're just not in the

1219.799 --> 1223.179
same realm anymore

1224.8 --> 1229.57
well wherever there the time traveller

1227.86 --> 1234.3999999999999
is going anything could happen from

1229.57 --> 1239.23
there on that seems the most logical

1234.4 --> 1246.91
anyway yeah totally drifting off you

1239.23 --> 1250.09
have Mandela effect I think I think it's

1246.91 --> 1252.5500000000002
rather if there's anything to it a real

1250.09 --> 1260.07
exchange I think it's rather a magician

1252.55 --> 1268.4199999999998
trickery very complex may be

1260.07 --> 1270.85
interdimensional mind trick but I think

1268.42 --> 1274.8400000000001
that it's probably just mostly a mind

1270.85 --> 1277.99
trick based on study of how psychology

1274.84 --> 1281.53
functions and what you could do it's

1277.99 --> 1285.43
almost like when you describe it as I

1281.53 --> 1289.72
did before with yeah using a name

1285.43 --> 1292.15
exactly wrong that it feels wrong feels

1289.72 --> 1295.33
off so you'll want to remember it in

1292.15 --> 1298.42
another way and that blurs out your

1295.33 --> 1300.52
general memory of it and then later you

1298.42 --> 1303.69
remember it like hey it should be this

1300.52 --> 1306.8799999999999
but it's no it's actually that and

1303.69 --> 1310.8400000000001
that's almost like just an annoying card

1306.88 --> 1314.3200000000002
trick basically it's on that level it's

1310.84 --> 1317.22
an annoying very long term card trick

1314.32 --> 1321.85
with big advertisement behind it which

1317.22 --> 1326.77
is particularly brutal but it is a mind

1321.85 --> 1330.27
trick so it's it's probably Occam's

1326.77 --> 1330.27
razor just that

1341.54 --> 1344.3799999999999
anyway

1345.3 --> 1353.81
yeah you guys all talking about sorry it

1349.38 --> 1353.8100000000002
took me very long to respond to that

1365.87 --> 1369.62
subtle infinity

1374.37 --> 1380.8999999999999
other new new-age algorithms

1378.39 --> 1380.9
really

1385.13 --> 1393.91
how're you mean principles right

1389.44 --> 1400.539
algorithms are you talking about word

1393.91 --> 1400.539
algorithms like cybernetics

1404.82 --> 1410.1
are they very specific in their

1406.77 --> 1414.2
cybernetics that means the exact use of

1410.1 --> 1420.4199999999998
your words a specific range of words

1414.2 --> 1424.65
that have certain effects directly it's

1420.42 --> 1428.04
like a hardcore study statistical study

1424.65 --> 1430.5600000000002
of indirect influences of words on the

1428.04 --> 1435.26
understood yes statistically on the on

1430.56 --> 1435.26
the public as it is it's very complex

1437.18 --> 1442.89
it's called cybernetics I talked in my

1440.7 --> 1449.28
time talk to people that studied that

1442.89 --> 1451.17
and it's presumed it was even speculated

1449.28 --> 1453.1499999999999
back then that it would be taken over by

1451.17 --> 1458.43
the AI because they could absolutely

1453.15 --> 1463.64
perfect it and just create word

1458.43 --> 1463.64
protocols to just make a giant influence

1464.15 --> 1470.91
potentially seemingly miraculously so

1466.8 --> 1475.1299999999999
it's interesting to hear if if that is

1470.91 --> 1475.13
involved it's if it's about cybernetics

1485.65 --> 1491.13
all right cooky hello chocolate saying

1489.51 --> 1494.68
[Music]

1491.13 --> 1500.0100000000002
yeah I am open for panel I've put out

1494.68 --> 1500.01
the link in the in Skype chat

1508.32 --> 1512.6399999999999
hmm

1510.59 --> 1520.22
okay

1512.64 --> 1520.22
I don't know what the the egregore is

1528.1 --> 1531.24
[Music]

1563.97 --> 1575.909
so anything else if you want to talk

1570.159 --> 1575.909
about it on the panel and you can join

1585.11 --> 1590.3899999999999
dear bill gee that's just terrible

1597.61 --> 1601.4099999999999
hello ace MacLeod

1611.81 --> 1621.1699999999998
I'd have been rambling on for so long

1617.36 --> 1621.1699999999998
kind of run out of steam

1625.09 --> 1628.29
[Music]

1638.52 --> 1641.52
Cheers

1646.41 --> 1651.8290000000002
huh

1648.73 --> 1651.829
[Music]

1652.21 --> 1663.73
hello yeah sure you can ally be if you

1660.26 --> 1663.73
want to criticize Owen Benjamin

1665.35 --> 1668.35
sure

1672.809 --> 1675.649
hmm

1701.91 --> 1708.8300000000002
okay that's very interesting egregore a

1711.74 --> 1723.08
collective group mind and autonomous

1719.34 --> 1726.27
psychic entity made up of and

1723.08 --> 1733.74
influencing the thoughts of a group of

1726.27 --> 1742.61
people huh yeah like a spirit possessing

1733.74 --> 1742.61
them there are a principle

1745.35 --> 1752.2099999999998
so yeah you could personify it

1748.519 --> 1755.009
potentially as like it were an entity

1752.21 --> 1758.73
but it's mostly the principles and the

1755.009 --> 1763.669
principles have certain influences that

1758.73 --> 1773.009
change the person in accordance to the

1763.669 --> 1781.5590000000002
frequency of the principle in D&D

1773.009 --> 1784.429
yeah you would call an alignment hello

1781.559 --> 1786.99
Ben saw saw band it

1784.429 --> 1791.97
yeah it was it was interesting with

1786.99 --> 1798.929
Morrow I had a lot of energy

1791.97 --> 1801.419
I was really really focused yeah coffee

1798.929 --> 1804.1490000000001
in the evening I rarely do it and it was

1801.419 --> 1806.22
just like really ready to yeah he

1804.149 --> 1808.049
constantly asked me before like oh I

1806.22 --> 1809.97
want to talk about magic magic saw is

1808.049 --> 1813.6589999999999
like okay really

1809.97 --> 1817.039
are you sure okay okay so that means

1813.659 --> 1823.8790000000001
okay I have to be very serious

1817.039 --> 1823.879
and careful because I'm basically

1824.149 --> 1830.61
technically in a way that's somebody

1826.889 --> 1835.08
petitioning for apprenticeship in a way

1830.61 --> 1837.299
they want to hear you out about it so I

1835.08 --> 1841.32
got a size him up carefully and all that

1837.299 --> 1845.6
and now what it yeah a lot of

1841.32 --> 1849.4089999999999
seriousness takes a lot of energy and

1845.6 --> 1852.299
the coffee really worked well for me

1849.409 --> 1854.99
sometimes the coffee gives me a short

1852.299 --> 1859.4089999999999
boost and then I get all tired out again

1854.99 --> 1862.409
mm-hmm but it worked really well now and

1859.409 --> 1865.1290000000001
dammit now I want coffee I'm thinking

1862.409 --> 1865.1290000000001
about coffee again

1867.07 --> 1870.999
I'm turning it to Janeway

1875.83 --> 1879.9089999999999
she's always talking about coffee

1889.68 --> 1892.94
little micro raw

1904.05 --> 1911.43
all right so Glenfinnan t goody

1908.31 --> 1917.12
yeah I used to watch him but I got kind

1911.43 --> 1917.1200000000001
of annoyed he's a

1927.51 --> 1933.559
if I remember it right I don't know he

1933.83 --> 1941.519
yeah look giving good criticism can be

1937.559 --> 1944.7
pretty harsh so I think the guy is

1941.519 --> 1953.909
pretty smart but he seems to be delving

1944.7 --> 1956.22
into its it's complex because he is

1953.909 --> 1960.409
pretty creative with it in a way but he

1956.22 --> 1968.549
delves into yeah racial victimhood

1960.409 --> 1971.779
thinking that that side and he does try

1968.549 --> 1975.69
to like uplift not in an aggressive way

1971.779 --> 1978.299
break out of it and that's good but just

1975.69 --> 1983.929
to appeal to some kind of victimhood

1978.299 --> 1983.929
that's just not good ever in my opinion

1985.58 --> 1991.1689999999999
like you've been done wrong yeah you

1988.95 --> 1995.6100000000001
know what that kind of [ __ ] happens a

1991.169 --> 2000.919
lot in the world and they love to

1995.61 --> 2003.11
imagine like that's like that could be

2000.919 --> 2006.44
like that's never gonna happen and but

2003.11 --> 2010.1299999999999
everyone's like seriously find a group

2006.44 --> 2014.559
of people whose ancestors at some point

2010.13 --> 2017.8990000000001
have not been victimized in some way and

2014.559 --> 2020.08
it's just a bad mentality that's just my

2017.899 --> 2020.08
opinion

2021.63 --> 2025.7800000000002
it's not a good frequency to wield that

2024.64 --> 2034.38
anyway

2025.78 --> 2045.28
yeah I've been joined by Ali B hello Oh

2034.38 --> 2053.08
your volume is kind of low all done I'll

2045.28 --> 2056.2
put you up it sounds like your

2053.08 --> 2059.29
microphone is very far away yeah Bob

2056.2 --> 2062.23
yeah oh hey Zack no yeah a lot there

2059.29 --> 2064.3
yeah yeah it is because I had one of the

2062.23 --> 2066.07
Bluetooth there speakers it's got a

2064.3 --> 2067.78
microphone on it as well you know they

2066.07 --> 2070.06
need bluetooth little should be

2067.78 --> 2071.98
couplings on it's right there's got

2070.06 --> 2075.46
major point I just forget I'm using it

2071.98 --> 2078.4900000000002
sometimes I know right Arwen hey thanks

2075.46 --> 2082.179
for joining man sorry you do dorms not a

2078.49 --> 2085.33
faint faint of being I'll be no annoying

2082.179 --> 2087.429
near boils and stuff like that I know

2085.33 --> 2089.77
there was a way all the elegance I

2087.429 --> 2094.6
couldn't be boiled going on hangouts and

2089.77 --> 2097.5099999999998
stuff out but since the rally criteria

2094.6 --> 2100.45
or Ronnie going on about the light and

2097.51 --> 2102.0400000000004
stuff laughs I've just I've just for the

2100.45 --> 2103.99
past couple of weeks I've just been

2102.04 --> 2105.64
hammered and light reading up about as

2103.99 --> 2108.8799999999997
as much as I can

2105.64 --> 2111.5499999999997
yeah about it okay nothing so I'm kinda

2108.88 --> 2114.9100000000003
rejuvenate again I had to read wait you

2111.55 --> 2117.7000000000003
had like a repeated that it's like

2114.91 --> 2120.58
what's the point King nothing but as I

2117.7 --> 2121.8599999999997
see a peak it's just where everything

2120.58 --> 2125.29
falls into place

2121.86 --> 2128.8
yeah exactly you really got something to

2125.29 --> 2131.43
do which you can like you can totally

2128.8 --> 2135.13
work on it and it's just a lot of fun I

2131.43 --> 2137.2599999999998
get it yeah well that that's that's

2135.13 --> 2140.92
basically what I'm doing them I'm just

2137.26 --> 2145.9900000000002
gonna like Boise's and not Sean G just

2140.92 --> 2149.29
here talking to oh I just it fascinating

2145.99 --> 2152.3799999999997
it's more of our I'm more having fun and

2149.29 --> 2154.25
actually than you really cuz I know I

2152.38 --> 2156.38
know that I can't know when every time

2154.25 --> 2159.92
Amica statement or ask the question you

2156.38 --> 2161.42
know the answer you're gonna get more

2159.92 --> 2163.25
like every time it doesn't matter what

2161.42 --> 2166.16
you say it's like repeat repeat repeat

2163.25 --> 2169.97
repeat is only the same technology well

2166.16 --> 2173.5699999999997
getting back off and easy of these

2169.97 --> 2178.39
people you know I've talked a few a ball

2173.57 --> 2178.3900000000003
awesome driver a couple in private

2178.4 --> 2182.4500000000003
they'll actually they I'm not gonna name

2180.29 --> 2185.27
any names but they are there's a lot

2182.45 --> 2188.0899999999997
alumnus and the conspiracy theory but

2185.27 --> 2189.74
they would talk about well you know why

2188.09 --> 2194.57
you won't talk about it's about that you

2189.74 --> 2198.1099999999997
know there's there's quite a few of them

2194.57 --> 2199.6400000000003
you may not think me being tipper

2198.11 --> 2200.84
they're just too scared to talk about it

2199.64 --> 2203.66
because you'll just get flung out and

2200.84 --> 2205.9300000000003
wild lemaise about what it what

2203.66 --> 2210.5299999999997
conspiracy theory

2205.93 --> 2212.77
no oh like about a vaccines or the

2210.53 --> 2215.3900000000003
government controls things or pedophilia

2212.77 --> 2217.07
in the vacuum groups you mean to say

2215.39 --> 2220.91
they're afraid of all conspiracy

2217.07 --> 2223.4900000000002
theories no no no no sort of it smells

2220.91 --> 2226.1
probably cuz I talk too fast right no

2223.49 --> 2228.7999999999997
they believe and some of them running

2226.1 --> 2230.96
but they would this is ball air force

2228.8 --> 2234.4700000000003
but they wouldn't see anything because

2230.96 --> 2236.7200000000003
they'll get flung out though the ball

2234.47 --> 2239.99
air puzzle tunnel back on yeah they bite

2236.72 --> 2244.52
their tongues constantly that's right

2239.99 --> 2249.14
yeah so that's it that's a that's like

2244.52 --> 2253.25
the the problem of course sort of not

2249.14 --> 2254.99
which I find a bit I can't call them

2253.25 --> 2257.69
disingenuous because I can't negate it

2254.99 --> 2259.91
but the problem is Arvind they can't

2257.69 --> 2262.31
ever come over and talk to us they've

2259.91 --> 2264.83
called us retards and at the air some

2262.31 --> 2269.21
every world and they could never even if

2264.83 --> 2271.19
they do adopt the question he wouldn't

2269.21 --> 2273.86
do because if they dock their fly you've

2271.19 --> 2275.69
gotta come over and and be nice to the

2273.86 --> 2277.55
very same people and they have to look

2275.69 --> 2278.9900000000002
for forgiveness you have to expect but

2277.55 --> 2281.69
governors because they are good you'd be

2278.99 --> 2283.43
looking at they seen people no ID before

2281.69 --> 2285.98
they were called meat ants and Eddie

2283.43 --> 2287.7799999999997
it's and honestly nothing solar Cana and

2285.98 --> 2290.8
a rock and a hard

2287.78 --> 2294.2900000000004
please love set themselves up you know

2290.8 --> 2295.55
study so they can suffer

2294.29 --> 2298.88
yeah but exactly how you get what I mean

2295.55 --> 2302.69
so they can suffer late on stuff on you

2298.88 --> 2306.83
know but I by Oren Bend you in a wooden

2302.69 --> 2309.4700000000003
Benjamin I think he goes too strong in

2306.83 --> 2315.71
the Jews are and you know with we you've

2309.47 --> 2319.1299999999997
all yeah but see this is a a great look

2315.71 --> 2320.7200000000003
that you can can you and I had was okay

2319.13 --> 2324.7400000000002
no way I'll ask the question can you

2320.72 --> 2326.6
give us melee there's some priests that

2324.74 --> 2328.64
say they believe in God and they don't

2326.6 --> 2337.97
actually believe in God and you could

2328.64 --> 2340.3399999999997
you cannot accept that no but well but

2337.97 --> 2342.77
definitely there are priests that have

2340.34 --> 2344.1800000000003
doubts at times and they will be

2342.77 --> 2347.2
conflicted about it and they'll talk

2344.18 --> 2349.7599999999998
about it with others definitely know I'm

2347.2 --> 2352.85
re okay may be asking what about doesn't

2349.76 --> 2355.28
do you believe those people that have

2352.85 --> 2357.37
been put in a place and they a Catholic

2355.28 --> 2361.5400000000004
Church they don't believe in God and

2357.37 --> 2367.04
they're just their same reasons

2361.54 --> 2369.32
believing God well they'll definitely

2367.04 --> 2374.0
regard God from another perspective

2369.32 --> 2377.63
let's just say it like that but I think

2374.0 --> 2380.6
there's very little powerful people that

2377.63 --> 2385.57
truly do not believe in God but they

2380.6 --> 2385.5699999999997
like to rearrange the perspective on it

2386.2 --> 2394.5499999999997
yeah it's like it's like they know there

2391.16 --> 2397.73
is a God but they don't like to think

2394.55 --> 2399.9100000000003
about it so they make up or they they

2397.73 --> 2402.5
become part of this way of thinking

2399.91 --> 2404.93
where it's just pooh-poohed put in the

2402.5 --> 2408.32
corner made it into something ridiculous

2404.93 --> 2411.77
even though they know it they use that

2408.32 --> 2416.03
imagination world to believe it and be

2411.77 --> 2420.7599999999998
go with that flow that's right really

2416.03 --> 2424.6000000000004
how it works now yeah yeah yeah i'm yeah

2420.76 --> 2426.28
so it's like so when he cuz I think

2424.6 --> 2428.02
because I used to listen I used to be

2426.28 --> 2429.8500000000004
worse than her

2428.02 --> 2432.64
yeah well that wouldn't Benjamin he's

2429.85 --> 2435.58
easily pink soft courting me but doesn't

2432.64 --> 2437.98
matter he's actually I moved on because

2435.58 --> 2440.2599999999998
I lay on me a minute there could

2437.98 --> 2442.9900000000002
actually be people that see that little

2440.26 --> 2445.44
Jewish and they're Jews but they don't

2442.99 --> 2447.91
practice up there using it as a clock

2445.44 --> 2451.27
right that's what I've seen

2447.91 --> 2455.1099999999997
so either depends on the family that's

2451.27 --> 2457.54
true there can be like none series Jews

2455.11 --> 2460.54
but there are still respond to family

2457.54 --> 2462.07
she was a very strong with family yeah

2460.54 --> 2466.0299999999997
but what happens if the whole family is

2462.07 --> 2469.54
like that then they'll still respond to

2466.03 --> 2470.82
other two families it happens they come

2469.54 --> 2473.23
and visit one another

2470.82 --> 2474.73
yeah I know but we are talking elites

2473.23 --> 2477.01
we're not talking about the guy that

2474.73 --> 2478.66
lives in down the road from you you

2477.01 --> 2479.8900000000003
understand that I had said the community

2478.66 --> 2483.46
we have talking about people that we

2479.89 --> 2486.4
don't see and or they pretended you

2483.46 --> 2488.14
think they could possibly like the

2486.4 --> 2490.6600000000003
Jesuits what to do that I mean and

2488.14 --> 2492.6099999999997
they're the protocol DJ other that's

2490.66 --> 2494.5899999999997
what you call another the segment in our

2492.61 --> 2498.4300000000003
earth to be Nadia

2494.59 --> 2500.3500000000004
he said you will be a you well put the

2498.43 --> 2503.1099999999997
cloak on of a Jew you won't get the

2500.35 --> 2505.6
cloak on of a question you will because

2503.11 --> 2510.9700000000003
it's for the beggar a cause so they're

2505.6 --> 2513.79
already seen that people and a like a

2510.97 --> 2515.56
guy that saw jeiza on look who goes

2513.79 --> 2516.91
every question Jews they're going on

2515.56 --> 2521.2599999999998
different religions and they become

2516.91 --> 2523.06
powerful means it is the thing that is

2521.26 --> 2525.2200000000003
you know that's the part of being part

2523.06 --> 2527.65
of the network when things become

2525.22 --> 2531.6699999999996
convenient but what should anyway be

2527.65 --> 2534.34
used it's what you think I'm talking

2531.67 --> 2536.32
about they do you actually think those

2534.34 --> 2539.6200000000003
are group of people in this world that's

2536.32 --> 2541.57
a determined to so a law the population

2539.62 --> 2545.38
and have and build their own little

2541.57 --> 2547.63
paradise do believe on let me think it's

2545.38 --> 2550.2400000000002
a possibility it's not a group of people

2547.63 --> 2553.32
it is like a a cult

2550.24 --> 2553.3199999999997
kind of a

2553.69 --> 2562.73
post-modern post societal Western cult

2559.28 --> 2565.9300000000003
and yes there are definitely elites very

2562.73 --> 2568.61
much into that and that go way too far

2565.93 --> 2571.31
lighten could they poses it's all kind

2568.61 --> 2574.61
of barbarous the crazy religions and

2571.31 --> 2578.54
[ __ ] yeah you know could you think you

2574.61 --> 2580.9100000000003
could maybe poses are a Christian or a

2578.54 --> 2584.15
priest or a Jew or do you think you

2580.91 --> 2587.0899999999997
could actually put people in place like

2584.15 --> 2588.77
that and and they were that God wasn't

2587.09 --> 2591.3500000000004
Christ that was the guy that called them

2588.77 --> 2594.53
to go with me on can you think that's

2591.35 --> 2598.64
possible now those people pretended he

2594.53 --> 2602.09
be Jews now running about blackening the

2598.64 --> 2604.0099999999998
name of Jews on purpose just to keep

2602.09 --> 2606.44
that heat going like the black people in

2604.01 --> 2608.42
blah blah blah you know they well the

2606.44 --> 2611.3
funny thing abut there's something weird

2608.42 --> 2616.9
so I've heard about the Jewish culture

2611.3 --> 2622.79
and that is that a kind of don't mind

2616.9 --> 2624.62
it's weird they just well I left in a

2622.79 --> 2626.66
Jewish community and they were Hasidic

2624.62 --> 2628.64
Jews you know the Orthodox with a curly

2626.66 --> 2631.16
well he's in the black hat I lived with

2628.64 --> 2633.5
him for five years man in London of my

2631.16 --> 2636.44
neighbors with all the people and very

2633.5 --> 2638.0
very nice people places people nice to

2636.44 --> 2639.83
talk to and stuff like they went going

2638.0 --> 2641.36
about trying to control these guys

2639.83 --> 2643.7599999999998
weren't running about trying to control

2641.36 --> 2646.9700000000003
her they were doing their dealings with

2643.76 --> 2650.1200000000003
diamonds and maybe it would you would

2646.97 --> 2652.1899999999996
you call it a scam in the social system

2650.12 --> 2654.38
they were the worst at oh and by the way

2652.19 --> 2658.88
well you know just some of them looks

2654.38 --> 2661.4900000000002
there that's family again like it this

2658.88 --> 2665.63
this may start to sound a bit like

2661.49 --> 2669.29
Jewish but it's like this Jews often

2665.63 --> 2672.17
have bigger families the traditionalists

2669.29 --> 2675.56
right yo and here they go in all

2672.17 --> 2680.4500000000003
directions most Jewish families are

2675.56 --> 2683.33
liberal they let their yeah their family

2680.45 --> 2686.7799999999997
do whatever they want and some of them

2683.33 --> 2689.12
will become like almost social

2686.78 --> 2691.9300000000003
banker types that are just greedy and

2689.12 --> 2695.0899999999997
control or rather out of control and

2691.93 --> 2697.16
they'll just like okay they will be

2695.09 --> 2699.7400000000002
still functional they're very good at

2697.16 --> 2702.8599999999997
defending themselves and using every

2699.74 --> 2705.14
method that they can find and they'll

2702.86 --> 2707.84
just let them do that it's like yeah

2705.14 --> 2709.7
he's bad we know but yeah sometimes he

2707.84 --> 2711.38
suddenly like helps out in a big way

2709.7 --> 2713.4199999999996
financial you know he knows all the

2711.38 --> 2719.6800000000003
right lawyers and that's how it works

2713.42 --> 2719.6800000000003
it's like very tolerance to each other

2720.34 --> 2727.1000000000004
yeah but those pragmatic it's also based

2724.94 --> 2731.87
on pragmatism it's just knowing how to

2727.1 --> 2734.33
deal with the great diversity within the

2731.87 --> 2739.5499999999997
same group it's very interesting

2734.33 --> 2741.41
actually well I believe that the the

2739.55 --> 2743.3
people that they'll see know of Jewish

2741.41 --> 2747.7
are not practicing Jews it's just that

2743.3 --> 2749.75
it's a it's a label that the wheel for

2747.7 --> 2753.56
there could be Jewish well they probably

2749.75 --> 2756.23
aren't Jewish but I'm saying that most

2753.56 --> 2758.93
of these businesses are run buying

2756.23 --> 2760.46
Jewish people and if you get my Jewish

2758.93 --> 2762.44
person that's pretending to be a Jew and

2760.46 --> 2764.87
he's not really you know like what you

2762.44 --> 2765.98
say that I think some will you say poor

2764.87 --> 2767.63
they give money you know they have

2765.98 --> 2770.93
banked on he's the Kepler money very

2767.63 --> 2773.21
soon yeah but he you know why they this

2770.93 --> 2775.87
sounds weird but it's kind of pragmatic

2773.21 --> 2779.42
you know why as many Jews are in power

2775.87 --> 2782.63
from a more superficial standpoint not

2779.42 --> 2784.46
from a old situational power connection

2782.63 --> 2786.8900000000003
but from a superficial standpoint

2784.46 --> 2789.95
they're often used because they're very

2786.89 --> 2792.5299999999997
efficient and they don't have a lot of

2789.95 --> 2795.8599999999997
personal issues with business so they

2792.53 --> 2799.3700000000003
don't mind firing people and [ __ ] and

2795.86 --> 2802.28
being financially brutal and that makes

2799.37 --> 2805.6099999999997
them efficient and that's why their land

2802.28 --> 2807.9500000000003
on top because it's hell up there to

2805.61 --> 2811.46
have to decide so many big things and

2807.95 --> 2813.23
they don't mind it and that's why

2811.46 --> 2816.5
they're yeah that's true that's true a

2813.23 --> 2820.01
general Aviv a eloquent Benjamin a had a

2816.5 --> 2822.2
guy on him or a George not

2820.01 --> 2824.63
what it was his name I think it was

2822.2 --> 2829.0699999999997
someone joins in the Azhar he was

2824.63 --> 2832.61
actually born on a boat it's like a

2829.07 --> 2835.8500000000004
social thing you know but quite they

2832.61 --> 2838.4300000000003
they've got their psychology or is it

2835.85 --> 2840.83
he was explained in a way by its Jews in

2838.43 --> 2842.99
Poland they always make up you know

2840.83 --> 2846.13
policies and stuff like that it's

2842.99 --> 2850.52
actually because well this is his theory

2846.13 --> 2852.83
actually because they feel they can help

2850.52 --> 2854.9
you know they want to help humanity came

2852.83 --> 2857.2999999999997
the thing you know it's kinda hard to

2854.9 --> 2858.9500000000003
swallow but I've got the concept of it

2857.3 --> 2861.32
that actually it's that in their nature

2858.95 --> 2862.7
to what it help because they think me

2861.32 --> 2865.13
have got the solution to everything

2862.7 --> 2867.41
because this was smart or whatever so

2865.13 --> 2869.4500000000003
these seem I don't know you should go

2867.41 --> 2872.1499999999996
and watch and watch the gang stuff he

2869.45 --> 2874.64
breaks it down the mentality of you know

2872.15 --> 2876.77
that electorally driving to do that yeah

2874.64 --> 2880.4
yeah you're talking about the basically

2876.77 --> 2882.23
the Christian Jews the that's a yeah it

2880.4 --> 2883.1800000000003
calmed that the torrent and the

2882.23 --> 2886.19
turanians

2883.18 --> 2889.0099999999998
that's exactly that's what you've got

2886.19 --> 2893.03
this thing that anyone a and and it I

2889.01 --> 2894.65
think the motives are kind of true but I

2893.03 --> 2896.48
think that arrogance is about much

2894.65 --> 2897.83
thinking that they can and that's why I

2896.48 --> 2901.85
think you keep getting into so much

2897.83 --> 2905.5099999999998
trouble apart from the sneaky no show me

2901.85 --> 2912.02
see but I think that's where are we all

2905.51 --> 2914.57
to coin a freeze on someone someone but

2912.02 --> 2915.95
I think it's one of our it apparently

2914.57 --> 2918.26
it's like a social thing and Whitney

2915.95 --> 2920.8999999999996
because I read a little bit about it and

2918.26 --> 2923.36
I saw I looked at the behavior through

2920.9 --> 2926.21
history and it does cannot point tell

2923.36 --> 2929.06
her that the the actually do would be

2926.21 --> 2930.5
hell but they're just not very good data

2929.06 --> 2932.33
if you know what I mean

2930.5 --> 2933.77
no I'm not and I'm not stuck it off but

2932.33 --> 2935.2999999999997
they Jews by no means but I've been

2933.77 --> 2936.86
through major heat and I went through

2935.3 --> 2940.9100000000003
heat and Jews at twenty year old

2936.86 --> 2943.34
mm-hm and then about 22 or 23 like that

2940.91 --> 2946.3999999999996
I wasn't taught that when as I cared

2943.34 --> 2948.44
what my dude and and I stopped a king of

2946.4 --> 2949.4
stop that but I understand exactly what

2948.44 --> 2952.07
he do

2949.4 --> 2956.57
but I came though

2952.07 --> 2958.46
a sailor and my head that these people

2956.57 --> 2959.4500000000003
are not really Jews because if they're

2958.46 --> 2961.73
really well

2959.45 --> 2964.52
Jews the real Jews like what you said

2961.73 --> 2968.21
that the Torah Jews in the toilet actual

2964.52 --> 2970.25
Judaism what Judaism as as the people

2968.21 --> 2972.77
that practice not you you should read a

2970.25 --> 2975.35
book on I by one of our scholars what

2972.77 --> 2976.82
Judaism as you would recognize it from

2975.35 --> 2978.77
what you've been told of what you

2976.82 --> 2983.1200000000003
understand is being Jewish or bought by

2978.77 --> 2984.83
jurors it's quite ah it's a very it's a

2983.12 --> 2986.48
very interesting book and actually right

2984.83 --> 2988.91
and it doesn't talk about it doesn't

2986.48 --> 2990.98
talk about we are better than anybody a

2988.91 --> 2993.68
real higher up than anybody else or I've

2990.98 --> 2996.68
they do talk about the Gentiles but they

2993.68 --> 2998.72
it's not that they look down on the

2996.68 --> 3001.5099999999998
money or thinking of beasts that comes

2998.72 --> 3002.89
out the Talmud which is Babylonian which

3001.51 --> 3004.9
is when they practiced all the

3002.89 --> 3007.93
witchcraft then will acting the esoteric

3004.9 --> 3012.12
stuff but proper true Judaism is that

3007.93 --> 3012.12
the Talmud is all about raw power

3012.21 --> 3017.26
yeah the Babylonian Talmud a the Talmud

3015.31 --> 3020.0499999999997
the that's the rules and break you shall

3017.26 --> 3022.5400000000004
do this you shan't do this this is this

3020.05 --> 3024.55
on every Tuesday when it's a full moon

3022.54 --> 3026.95
you have to come you'll hear from left

3024.55 --> 3029.44
to right it's basically on that that's

3026.95 --> 3031.89
well as it's like a real book man aren't

3029.44 --> 3034.69
they more did that in started be not

3031.89 --> 3037.12
body hey Leslie I don't know how many

3034.69 --> 3039.4900000000002
volumes as mindlessly and it gets

3037.12 --> 3041.65
improved all the time so it's like our

3039.49 --> 3044.6499999999996
philosophy and be like me news set and

3041.65 --> 3047.17
do philosophizing oh that's and really

3044.65 --> 3049.15
really maybe four or five of us coming

3047.17 --> 3051.31
here conclusion scene renounce a man in

3049.15 --> 3052.87
pitcher in the Talmud what's you know

3051.31 --> 3056.31
what after discussing or probably three

3052.87 --> 3059.62
these straight they like to talk and

3056.31 --> 3062.98
break things down to min you sure in all

3059.62 --> 3065.1099999999997
right like it seems that we you know and

3062.98 --> 3068.35
then and I think that's what the problem

3065.11 --> 3071.17
is is it's a cinemas in science or

3068.35 --> 3076.33
whatever they make it more complicated

3071.17 --> 3079.27
than as and so when you when you see

3076.33 --> 3081.7599999999998
something about science short concise

3079.27 --> 3083.08
people book or but what about that map

3081.76 --> 3084.7000000000003
and then you've got a good weapon

3083.08 --> 3086.5789999999997
more precisely it

3084.7 --> 3089.0789999999997
keeps going and then it just tongues out

3086.579 --> 3091.329
you're talking about something that has

3089.079 --> 3093.52
absolutely nothing to do your fossa team

3091.329 --> 3095.349
and you disclaiming is something that

3093.52 --> 3096.7
gets one more all right it's because of

3095.349 --> 3099.07
that all that's refraction diffraction

3096.7 --> 3100.359
was really criteria well that's where

3099.07 --> 3102.01
the Sun is you've got in these are the

3100.359 --> 3105.13
Sun its communities the book is

3102.01 --> 3109.1800000000003
basically a giant rumpus it's one yeah

3105.13 --> 3111.579
and one giant red herring yeah as a

3109.18 --> 3113.3999999999996
story and a giant red herring as to the

3111.579 --> 3115.54
explanations

3113.4 --> 3117.2200000000003
exactly and that's what's happened

3115.54 --> 3118.72
that's what's happened in science that's

3117.22 --> 3123.2799999999997
what philosophy is philosophically

3118.72 --> 3125.109
realms are like stupid EE almost if you

3123.28 --> 3126.9700000000003
know I mean because we are their base

3125.109 --> 3129.64
and there there are assumptions or their

3126.97 --> 3132.9399999999996
ideals or whatever on the water that the

3129.64 --> 3138.73
Lebanon you know that half of it with

3132.94 --> 3141.579
well 98.8% we don't have a clue about

3138.73 --> 3144.28
and that means um that's a time this is

3141.579 --> 3146.98
real stuff we can see so they thanked

3144.28 --> 3150.3100000000004
that because we only know science only

3146.98 --> 3153.01
knows about three percent of Eric kinda

3150.31 --> 3154.2999999999997
everything that was on here they seem to

3153.01 --> 3155.05
think they've got a sauce that's

3154.3 --> 3158.5
ridiculous

3155.05 --> 3161.829
that's like a scene you are an island

3158.5 --> 3165.13
can you tell me how to make a potato

3161.829 --> 3168.069
scones and then you see solved and

3165.13 --> 3171.339
that's a nice that's the obscure for

3168.069 --> 3173.71
those little flower water like up just

3171.339 --> 3180.369
so that so you're not getting I was just

3173.71 --> 3183.43
so no I think anyone Benjamin I wait to

3180.369 --> 3186.7200000000003
get on about now you think you think

3183.43 --> 3189.7
that he is in too much in too

3186.72 --> 3192.3999999999996
intertwined with the Jews the high real

3189.7 --> 3193.0
Jewish community is y'all the day's no

3192.4 --> 3200.14
homes

3193.0 --> 3205.42
I kind of agree in the sense that he is

3200.14 --> 3210.22
a friendly enemy it's almost like how

3205.42 --> 3212.5
Alex Jones started out but no more

3210.22 --> 3215.0499999999997
election is much more bluster and it's

3212.5 --> 3218.22
more about look little this agitation

3215.05 --> 3220.54
porn is financially beneficial and

3218.22 --> 3223.089
that's why they went with it that this

3220.54 --> 3225.819
that's a super overgeneralization by the

3223.089 --> 3229.02
way yeah yeah kind of a no Benjamin it's

3225.819 --> 3232.81
like look there is an advantage of these

3229.02 --> 3236.29
stigmatizing these things so that people

3232.81 --> 3238.7799999999997
can talk about it and that way blow off

3236.29 --> 3241.9
some steam so we don't have to kill you

3238.78 --> 3245.38
all that's exactly how Owen says it and

3241.9 --> 3250.359
that is so on target its pragmatic he's

3245.38 --> 3254.109
altering culture to create peace on the

3250.359 --> 3256.81
long run and that is and the Jews the

3254.109 --> 3258.67
Jews are smart enough to realize that

3256.81 --> 3260.589
and that's error why they're kind of

3258.67 --> 3262.869
letting it happen but they still have

3260.589 --> 3264.91
egos and they will damn well poke him

3262.869 --> 3267.73
they will damn well cut off his paper

3264.91 --> 3269.74
and cut off a super jet because they

3267.73 --> 3272.41
don't lead the way he talks

3269.74 --> 3273.9399999999996
because they're eager to come along well

3272.41 --> 3276.04
they they come along and put a bullet in

3273.94 --> 3278.079
the back it was sorta you know a bullet

3276.04 --> 3280.48
and his kids head and the rape is white

3278.079 --> 3282.01
flight in front you and then he'll know

3280.48 --> 3282.93
his wife and leave him look way too

3282.01 --> 3285.1600000000003
dramatic

3282.93 --> 3287.46
they don't was it really like what you

3285.16 --> 3290.2
don't you don't think that Marty

3287.46 --> 3292.359
opposition but yeah but don't you think

3290.2 --> 3293.859
these these people are so-called and

3292.359 --> 3298.2999999999997
controllable about killing people in

3293.859 --> 3302.5299999999997
assassinating people you know so he say

3298.3 --> 3305.53
ladies just do that the Jews don't just

3302.53 --> 3307.42
kill people they usually but not talk a

3305.53 --> 3315.73
lot about Jews what I've talked about

3307.42 --> 3318.099
people politeness Jews look I don't

3315.73 --> 3320.53
think they've been officially denounced

3318.099 --> 3323.619
as use they have not been exorcised from

3320.53 --> 3325.9300000000003
the community so as long as the total

3323.619 --> 3326.88
Jewish community doesn't do that their

3325.93 --> 3331.6299999999997
dues

3326.88 --> 3334.0
walk human aid the Orthodox Jewish

3331.63 --> 3336.9100000000003
priesthood what do you think just like

3334.0 --> 3339.55
George Soros if slums and Bill and

3336.91 --> 3340.93
rabbis and their opinions I'll tell you

3339.55 --> 3344.1400000000003
they're gonna be divided

3340.93 --> 3348.39
they're definitely rabbis plenty of them

3344.14 --> 3348.39
that will be totally fine with it

3348.47 --> 3357.75
because they are slightly more yea

3354.869 --> 3360.69
dividing the chosen people and the and

3357.75 --> 3366.93
the go Jim yeah that that mindset is

3360.69 --> 3370.05
still present among a lot of yeah it's

3366.93 --> 3372.72
like it's like the old-fashioned racism

3370.05 --> 3374.5800000000004
that they try to portray the Americans

3372.72 --> 3376.3199999999997
suppose they have and yeah Alex Jones

3374.58 --> 3378.39
confirmed there are some rare groups

3376.32 --> 3383.52
that still do that but used to be more

3378.39 --> 3385.7
that mindset it is in the Jewish people

3383.52 --> 3387.9
still prevalent and there's also

3385.7 --> 3392.0
leftists that are very principled

3387.9 --> 3395.64
against that but they sometimes switch

3392.0 --> 3397.71
it's very weird like when they get

3395.64 --> 3401.8199999999997
really pissed off they'll start to get

3397.71 --> 3404.28
all racist anyway and they may be less

3401.82 --> 3407.28
or later sorry or they'll just stay

3404.28 --> 3410.03
switched like how these mindsets of

3407.28 --> 3412.9700000000003
these people work is very complicated

3410.03 --> 3415.5800000000004
intelligent people are very complicated

3412.97 --> 3417.8399999999997
[Music]

3415.58 --> 3419.5499999999997
so do you think it's a good thing the

3417.84 --> 3421.6800000000003
oil Benjamin is a good like the oil

3419.55 --> 3426.4500000000003
Benjamin goes about slagging off Jews

3421.68 --> 3428.81
yes and I think it's good for Jews yep

3426.45 --> 3432.5899999999997
yeah sure no it's good

3428.81 --> 3434.97
cuz he doesn't just and what we are

3432.59 --> 3439.08
following what does he bring you flying

3434.97 --> 3442.2599999999998
was he gonna bring tea file buffering

3439.08 --> 3444.81
the least and I was talking about it no

3442.26 --> 3447.2700000000004
but look I want Benjamin is not like neo

3444.81 --> 3448.83
not seeing the [ __ ] out of the Jews he

3447.27 --> 3452.04
is literally making fun of their

3448.83 --> 3454.29
characteristics he is complaining about

3452.04 --> 3458.49
their sneakiness but still kind of in a

3454.29 --> 3461.6
funny way and he's just exposing look

3458.49 --> 3463.859
this is over there it's been cloaked and

3461.6 --> 3467.46
kind of don't Ness

3463.859 --> 3469.859
still the beneficiaries of it just don't

3467.46 --> 3472.26
attack them basically that's literally

3469.859 --> 3475.98
like look there's some really weird

3472.26 --> 3479.2400000000002
sneaky people over here don't trust them

3475.98 --> 3481.58
but these can still serve a function

3479.24 --> 3483.89
just don't kill her that's what he's

3481.58 --> 3486.59
doing Abba is generalizing this is the

3483.89 --> 3489.71
problem no it's not generalizing it was

3486.59 --> 3492.3500000000004
not analyzing no horse he only does that

3489.71 --> 3494.8
because of the jokes when he actually

3492.35 --> 3497.5099999999998
gets into the subject he absolutely

3494.8 --> 3501.3500000000004
differentiates just like I've been doing

3497.51 --> 3504.2900000000004
the whole spectrum of the Jewish

3501.35 --> 3507.92
community the division within them and

3504.29 --> 3510.56
the tradition of a division was I

3507.92 --> 3513.2000000000003
importantly thus important to them and

3510.56 --> 3517.22
he should be doing forever and it keeps

3513.2 --> 3518.68
them intellectually engaged so they

3517.22 --> 3522.4399999999996
don't tire down

3518.68 --> 3523.64
it's part look the Jewish community's

3522.44 --> 3527.09
extremely old

3523.64 --> 3533.8399999999997
it's totally engineered in a functional

3527.09 --> 3535.9
way in for them if it does it this but

3533.84 --> 3538.76
these these people are having power

3535.9 --> 3540.92
these people are out and piling stuff

3538.76 --> 3543.59
like they're not they are not solid in a

3540.92 --> 3545.08
while you a called a Torah reading Jews

3543.59 --> 3547.73
man

3545.08 --> 3548.93
they're not Jewish uses Jews are not

3547.73 --> 3552.32
dear rulers

3548.93 --> 3555.3799999999997
he's talking he is talking he's talking

3552.32 --> 3557.57
about a litter of people but it's like

3555.38 --> 3559.1600000000003
all right how did you like it when a

3557.57 --> 3561.77
moral ethics come you see are you oh you

3559.16 --> 3563.33
fly a thousand like this and of course

3561.77 --> 3566.45
it's something you've never said how do

3563.33 --> 3568.31
you feel about luck they're wrong when

3566.45 --> 3570.23
they say that they were just generalized

3568.31 --> 3572.24
all of our elf and that's what one

3570.23 --> 3575.39
Benjamin's doing is generalized all Oh

3572.24 --> 3577.7
juice was he and he's one that's why I

3575.39 --> 3579.7999999999997
cease until I'm not afraid of that [ __ ]

3577.7 --> 3585.3799999999997
I don't give a [ __ ] oh you oh you're

3579.8 --> 3587.869
being racist screw you that's fine but

3585.38 --> 3590.7200000000003
don't look carbon is hard enough uh

3587.869 --> 3592.8500000000004
strain again a story about the Flat

3590.72 --> 3597.2
Earth we we don't having something that

3592.85 --> 3601.0099999999998
you heat in Egypt at the SU hater

3597.2 --> 3602.99
he's dude no he doesn't why does he talk

3601.01 --> 3605.03
about the whole thing well not because

3602.99 --> 3608.06
he hates them he because he finds them

3605.03 --> 3610.8500000000004
hilarious and fascinating and a bit

3608.06 --> 3612.549
scary literally that's literally what he

3610.85 --> 3617.92
says every time another one is how

3612.549 --> 3621.489
reacts and does is very systematic don't

3617.92 --> 3623.559
be scared okay feel not far when you

3621.489 --> 3627.67
youyou think that way and just think

3623.559 --> 3629.469
that I don't I don't I'd rather he never

3627.67 --> 3632.9790000000003
mentioned fly off the McQuaid [ __ ]

3629.469 --> 3635.7690000000002
honest Oh ed - honestly really so you

don't have a hold on yeah well there's

3635.769 --> 3640.5089999999996
another person out there you know yeah

3638.439 --> 3643.569
you might know where she's close

3640.509 --> 3647.4
Eric demands of Eric debate now there's

3643.569 --> 3650.2889999999998
a guy that actually really hates them

3647.4 --> 3653.589
Eric Dubay hates Jews and everything he

3650.289 --> 3656.5490000000004
says he's not apologetic in any way he's

3653.589 --> 3661.14
not emphasizing anything good or only

3656.549 --> 3664.179
evil he is potentially potentially or

3661.14 --> 3667.5389999999998
apparently an ex terminus although he

3664.179 --> 3670.059
doesn't say that but it's the energy he

3667.539 --> 3672.2490000000003
dabbles with concerning that it's very

3670.059 --> 3673.7490000000003
threatening Eric Dubay that's the one

3672.249 --> 3675.9689999999996
you should be complaining about not

3673.749 --> 3677.6189999999997
other one bad well not complain about

3675.969 --> 3682.599
him he's not the one that's in the light

3677.619 --> 3685.089
he's not a celebrity or really not he's

3682.599 --> 3688.179
not a celebrity nice I know he's a bit

3685.089 --> 3690.549

anyway if he does if he does go I don't

3978.67 --> 3983.35
want him to come out like less you see

3981.55 --> 3987.25
he stops his chef with that easy

3983.35 --> 3990.85

that's being done and you just it's been

3994.63 --> 3997.9

3997.54 --> 4000.42
hell up

4005.97 --> 4013.0499999999997
handled even ad the dolphin in our way

4008.37 --> 4017.97
David Arvind Arvind ear Arvind

4013.05 --> 4019.4100000000003
oven yep okay from when was that oh he's

4017.97 --> 4021.2999999999997
been writing about he's been writing

4019.41 --> 4023.16
about the Jews and traveling about and

4021.3 --> 4026.3300000000004
tell all about the Jews for the last 80

4023.16 --> 4029.3999999999996
years of his life writing and doing

4026.33 --> 4032.7
presentations lectures right absolutely

4029.4 --> 4035.61
buck to her okay well being in jail been

4032.7 --> 4037.83
in geocoding very oh that's very cool

4035.61 --> 4039.7200000000003
and very brave of him but it's not a

4037.83 --> 4042.6
comedian it's not a comedian

4039.72 --> 4046.4399999999996
what big joke Amelia has a whole

4042.6 --> 4048.72
different range and set of people and if

4046.44 --> 4052.5
he's funny and he's funny and it will

4048.72 --> 4055.23
get to hear a lot of ears heard by ears

4052.5 --> 4056.76
of people that will not face at one of

4055.23 --> 4064.5
those lectures because they'd be bored

4056.76 --> 4066.1800000000003
out of their minds so so I just totally

4064.5 --> 4068.13
disagree with you I think

4066.18 --> 4070.6499999999996
oh and Benjamin is great if you don't

4068.13 --> 4073.8
like him he doesn't present you nobody

4070.65 --> 4076.11
presents you unless you say they do okay

4073.8 --> 4077.6400000000003
and everybody knows that look there's so

4076.11 --> 4079.6800000000003
many fighters to do all kinds of things

4077.64 --> 4081.42
they don't represent anybody really but

4079.68 --> 4083.7
themselves and if they do represent

4081.42 --> 4085.53
somebody else they mentioned them that

4083.7 --> 4087.48
person doesn't like it they will damn

4085.53 --> 4090.7200000000003
well hear about it and probably start

4087.48 --> 4091.8
some infighting [ __ ] usual so don't

4090.72 --> 4093.93
worry about it

4091.8 --> 4096.96
I really like Owen Benjamin he

4093.93 --> 4100.5
definitely does not present me but I

4096.96 --> 4102.81
would love to get into I laughter

4100.5 --> 4104.43
someday maybe have a conversation or

4102.81 --> 4108.6900000000005
something and probably not gonna happen

4104.43 --> 4111.08
I think we would clash naturally like in

4108.69 --> 4115.009
a sense that he probably doesn't like me

4111.08 --> 4118.92
not like from a from a more energy

4115.009 --> 4120.96
perspective I don't know but I still

4118.92 --> 4123.4800000000005
like him I think he's pretty awesome and

4120.96 --> 4126.41
I like his humor and I like that he just

4123.48 --> 4129.48
doesn't fear [ __ ] any talks about it all

4126.41 --> 4131.49
talks about human right here's the thing

4129.48 --> 4136.6089999999995
here's a psychological phenomena with

4131.49 --> 4138.34
humor I could I could make a joke about

4136.609 --> 4139.659000000001
for example

4138.34 --> 4142.81
[Music]

4139.659 --> 4144.4
but they wait on these subjects when you

4142.81 --> 4146.049
when you make enjoy the thing is with

4144.4 --> 4149.379999999999
human you can talk about a serious

4146.049 --> 4151.839
serious subject right second isn't a

4149.38 --> 4154.299
joke and lesson and that's all funny

4151.839 --> 4155.799
jokes do the good all they do is lessen

4154.299 --> 4159.659
the impact of the message that you've

4155.799 --> 4163.239
just Kevin made it funny so when when

4159.659 --> 4165.73
the person the whole dog that's in a

4163.239 --> 4167.8589999999995
retrospect thing that's this is like if

4165.73 --> 4169.8099999999995
something happened on the news and then

4167.859 --> 4171.6990000000005
you made a joke about it yeah that takes

4169.81 --> 4173.409000000001
away the power that's not how he's doing

4171.699 --> 4177.009
because he's bringing this information

4173.409 --> 4179.739
out of nowhere or he is saying things

4177.009 --> 4182.02
that you don't hear and doesn't it

4179.739 --> 4184.0
doesn't it doesn't have to be a pretty

4182.02 --> 4185.529
story I could make a joke up I'm not

4184.0 --> 4187.359
even reading us about a story I'm

4185.529 --> 4190.6900000000005
talking about a social situation maybe

4187.359 --> 4192.639
whatever but the fact is and it's fact

4190.69 --> 4194.86
and well I can't really see a

4192.639 --> 4196.900000000001
scientifically proven Hey because I

4194.86 --> 4199.179
can't use that anymore unfortunately

4196.9 --> 4202.57
which is now yeah well I can't I would

4199.179 --> 4205.63
have refused but the point is they do

4202.57 --> 4207.9
see and psychology when you are a meek I

4205.63 --> 4211.4800000000005
joke about a serious subject the subject

4207.9 --> 4213.339999999999
the person is lesson to the subject

4211.48 --> 4214.75
lessons right because you're laughing

4213.34 --> 4222.28
you're laughing

4214.75 --> 4223.75
I totally stupid joke about people dying

4222.28 --> 4225.969
or whatever and you make a joke about

4223.75 --> 4227.77
those play me oh the other way do

4225.969 --> 4231.219
specific it means specific but then

4227.77 --> 4233.38
context you can't define comedy like

4231.219 --> 4234.1
that it's about the context of the whole

4233.38 --> 4236.38
situation

4234.1 --> 4238.360000000001
no like Ray Allen the thing is it's a

4236.38 --> 4239.92
psychological phenomenon when you put a

4238.36 --> 4242.849999999999
message across and unique and you know

4239.92 --> 4245.56
Joe it loses its impact its

4242.85 --> 4247.870000000001
oversimplification what the comedy

4245.56 --> 4250.42
really is is a release file for

4247.87 --> 4252.909
attention that you really don't know how

4250.42 --> 4256.57
to place properly in a meaningful way

4252.909 --> 4259.36
and that's what it does and you do it by

4256.57 --> 4262.96
putting together situations that are

4259.36 --> 4265.9
awkward or weird or trigger you to

4262.96 --> 4268.9
basically break from keeping in the

4265.9 --> 4271.5
attention and give out a laugh about the

4268.9 --> 4273.518999999999
things that frustrate you it doesn't

4271.5 --> 4278.199
take away anything

4273.519 --> 4280.9800000000005
Nikki it's Ashley when I ridicule tell

4278.199 --> 4283.268999999999
me well it's not there's no I told me

4280.98 --> 4286.449
that's a fact well I just say it's off

4283.269 --> 4288.789000000001
but I don't you know it's a

4286.449 --> 4291.4
simplification yeah it's it's a fact but

4288.789 --> 4295.84
it's oversimplified no no that's yeah it

4291.4 --> 4298.289
is it is what can be used for that you

4295.84 --> 4303.55
want it to be we've been programmed to

4298.289 --> 4306.039
want to make things complicated the fact

4303.55 --> 4309.070000000001
is it's not over simplifying if I

4306.039 --> 4313.059
cracked a joke about well a disaster or

4309.07 --> 4314.739
whatever that harm it diminishes the

4313.059 --> 4317.139
actual mess is that your burden

4314.739 --> 4320.289
all right so South Park is evil as well

4317.139 --> 4322.32
then I guess well it doesn't know I love

4320.289 --> 4325.69
it it's awesome

4322.32 --> 4328.659
would you like a boat up I like that it

4325.69 --> 4330.249
doesn't [ __ ] around in the sense that it

4328.659 --> 4331.839999999999
does [ __ ] yeah it doesn't [ __ ] around

4330.249 --> 4334.119
with [ __ ] around it just does

4331.84 --> 4336.96
whatever the [ __ ] it wants and it's very

4334.119 --> 4339.299999999999
direct and very critical of society and

4336.96 --> 4342.28
yesterday the situation of the

4339.3 --> 4345.610000000001
collective group thinking and it's

4342.28 --> 4347.82
freaking brilliant and necessary and she

4345.61 --> 4351.789
gets a bit lazy at the end of it

4347.82 --> 4355.539
dramatic whine ish to format it to clear

4351.789 --> 4357.099
to clean but you know you know about

4355.539 --> 4359.53
that phenomenal like you know about a

4357.099 --> 4361.749
phenomena Quinn generally there's

4359.53 --> 4363.429
someone out shouting and bawling about a

4361.749 --> 4366.969
subject and stuff like that what that

4363.429 --> 4369.249
does is as its it it's like when people

4366.969 --> 4371.679
look to the it's a place and it's shown

4369.249 --> 4373.09
involving stuff like that they think oh

4371.679 --> 4375.78
that's good he's showing about I don't

4373.09 --> 4378.01
need to do anything about that then

4375.78 --> 4383.23
because no I'll leave that the other is

4378.01 --> 4385.96
going to do it for them no no well you

4383.23 --> 4387.869
know a leader shouting something out

4385.96 --> 4391.179
that you agree with often actually

4387.869 --> 4393.19
encourages you to start talking about it

4391.179 --> 4397.8
with somebody else because it is a

4393.19 --> 4397.799999999999
subject now so wrong
