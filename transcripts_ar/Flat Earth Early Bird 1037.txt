join button

79.04 --> 82.56
that would be much appreciated

83.6 --> 90.39999999999999
whether today is

87.439 --> 90.39999999999999
just take a look

93.04 --> 97.68
it's amazing

95.68 --> 99.119
it's one of the clearest blue skies i've

97.68 --> 101.84
seen

99.119 --> 104.0
in a while

101.84 --> 106.479
it's better than yesterday

104.0 --> 108.399
there seems to be less wind

106.479 --> 111.439
and there's no fluffy little clouds

108.399 --> 113.84
forming slowly so

111.439 --> 114.88
looks like today is going to be a bright

113.84 --> 118.159
sunny

114.88 --> 120.96
the day and well if it stays like this

118.159 --> 125.119
that also means that in the night

120.96 --> 125.119
it will probably get very cold

125.92 --> 129.75900000000001
because that does happen when it stays

128.479 --> 133.12
clear

129.759 --> 133.11999999999998
all day into the night

133.84 --> 138.16
yeah the clouds kind of stop the heat

135.52 --> 139.76000000000002
from escaping see

138.16 --> 142.48
so

139.76 --> 146.72
yeah but for now it's just beautiful

142.48 --> 146.72
bright the sun is delightful

148.16 --> 153.28
in the shadow yeah it can still be be a

150.4 --> 153.28
little chilly but

153.599 --> 158.79999999999998
like when you're in the sun

157.04 --> 161.84
out yeah

158.8 --> 165.59900000000002
like out of the wind's reach

161.84 --> 165.599
it's really delightful

166.48 --> 174.07999999999998
great moment to absorb some sun

171.28 --> 174.08
in autumn

178.48 --> 181.48
right

184.879 --> 189.67999999999998
hello

185.879 --> 192.39999999999998
terror306 first in chat

189.68 --> 194.31900000000002
ralph rodriguez

192.4 --> 197.72
good to see you is this channel monster

194.319 --> 197.72
yeah duh

198.959 --> 204.799
i mean there's a super chat system and

202.319 --> 207.599
there are ads so

204.799 --> 209.44
i think most people that are gonna

207.599 --> 210.79899999999998
check out my shows

209.44 --> 213.35999999999999
live

210.799 --> 216.48000000000002
or afterward are gonna bump into ads but

213.36 --> 219.68
i made sure to set it in a specific way

216.48 --> 221.67999999999998
so that you will always be able to click

219.68 --> 224.31900000000002
it away after five seconds if it doesn't

221.68 --> 226.72
automatically go away after five seconds

224.319 --> 228.79899999999998
so one condition so that you're not

226.72 --> 232.4
going to be stuck like watching 25

228.799 --> 234.64000000000001
second ads which is really annoying

232.4 --> 234.64000000000001
so

234.879 --> 239.599
clicked on an ad visit

236.799 --> 244.0
it helps no

239.599 --> 244.0
i don't think so this is not helping me

245.68 --> 249.92000000000002
i mean if there are ads for something

248.799 --> 252.84
good

249.92 --> 256.4
that seems worthy of

252.84 --> 258.959
like getting or whatever and whatever

256.4 --> 260.799
it's for yeah sure you know

258.959 --> 263.199
but

260.799 --> 266.08
i don't necessarily need you to click on

263.199 --> 266.08
every ad because

267.68 --> 274.08
yeah i get basically paid for you just

269.919 --> 274.08
seeing it that's how the ads work

275.199 --> 277.759
that's all

278.0 --> 281.0
[ __ ]

289.04 --> 292.96000000000004
hello america silver patriot ralph

291.36 --> 296.759
rodriguez

292.96 --> 296.75899999999996
stone monkey 3d

308.56 --> 314.96
okay a guy worked at an airport

312.32 --> 316.15999999999997
and he confirmed so he basically gave

314.96 --> 318.23999999999995
you a

316.16 --> 321.12
a verbal agreement

318.24 --> 325.56
like yeah that happens

321.12 --> 325.56
like did he have any detailed testimony

326.32 --> 331.36
or is it just something he has become

328.88 --> 334.36
aware of from the distance from in the

331.36 --> 334.36
distance

338.56 --> 343.36
they spray these guys to move clouds

340.72 --> 345.28000000000003
away from the airport oh really

343.36 --> 347.84000000000003
huh

345.28 --> 352.4
okay but that sounds like a local

347.84 --> 355.52
application not a universal

352.4 --> 357.84
tapestry of chemtrails worldwide so

355.52 --> 361.52
that's like a local

357.84 --> 365.08
little geoengineering application

361.52 --> 365.08
right could be

371.52 --> 375.24
hello gaining wisdom

381.84 --> 387.039
right so yeah man yesterday

385.44 --> 388.71999999999997
holy [ __ ]

387.039 --> 391.199
yesterday man

388.72 --> 392.84000000000003
i've been

391.199 --> 395.6
so active it's

392.84 --> 396.56
crazy so

395.6 --> 399.84000000000003
yeah

396.56 --> 403.28000000000003
that was the early bird show

399.84 --> 406.0
then there was the flat earth debate

403.28 --> 409.19899999999996
then i got

406.0 --> 410.8
on mitchell from australia's show

409.199 --> 413.12
i think yeah i did announce that

410.8 --> 414.8
yesterday i hope everybody saw that

413.12 --> 418.16
it was great

414.8 --> 418.16
another one and a half hours

418.72 --> 422.639
and yeah

420.16 --> 424.96000000000004
it was a good conversation i was a a

422.639 --> 428.0
little less folk more rambly but that's

424.96 --> 429.84
because it's like late and i had like i

428.0 --> 430.96
had my beers for the

429.84 --> 433.67999999999995
evening

430.96 --> 433.68
behind me

434.72 --> 438.319
right

437.199 --> 440.72
uh

438.319 --> 444.639
but yeah it went great i think

440.72 --> 444.639
it was very gratifying and

445.68 --> 449.52
and i think i got a couple of new

447.44 --> 453.12
subscribers too from it because now i'm

449.52 --> 455.68
at 2064.

453.12 --> 460.039
i could have seen that coming

455.68 --> 460.039
like that went quick all of a sudden

464.08 --> 471.68
oh wow it's 66 now huh

468.319 --> 475.68
so yeah that's nice

471.68 --> 475.68
hope the new subscribers are

477.12 --> 481.039
i'm gonna enjoy the shows that i do

481.12 --> 486.479
it is very live though every day so it's

484.879 --> 489.03900000000004
you can't really

486.479 --> 490.44
expect on my early bird show that i'm

489.039 --> 493.68
gonna have

490.44 --> 496.4
presentations ready every time like

493.68 --> 497.44
to be fair most people do hangouts like

496.4 --> 499.919
that

497.44 --> 502.0
they have a whole book

499.919 --> 504.79999999999995
ready to roll out

502.0 --> 507.919
i improvise a lot and that also means

504.8 --> 509.199
often silent moments and

507.919 --> 510.79999999999995
social

509.199 --> 512.88
ruckus because of

510.8 --> 515.36
well people in chat

512.88 --> 517.76
interacting with that right so it is

515.36 --> 518.5600000000001
really live and raw

517.76 --> 521.519
but

518.56 --> 523.4399999999999
yeah if you want me to address something

521.519 --> 525.04
specific or you're curious about

523.44 --> 528.48
something

525.04 --> 530.8
don't be surprised that if you ask

528.48 --> 533.04
if you choose to ask that it might have

530.8 --> 534.64
something interesting to say about it

533.04 --> 537.36
even if

534.64 --> 539.4399999999999
it's supposed to be like specialist

537.36 --> 540.72
knowledge

539.44 --> 543.2790000000001
right

540.72 --> 545.9200000000001
i have my ways

543.279 --> 547.279
i'm an oracle anyway

545.92 --> 548.959
yeah that

547.279 --> 551.279
happened mitchell from australia and

548.959 --> 551.279
then

551.36 --> 557.12
there was no gaming for me yesterday

553.6 --> 559.6800000000001
because i just didn't have the time then

557.12 --> 562.399
uh yeah dusty ryder contacted me through

559.68 --> 565.5999999999999
skype as i as i advised him

562.399 --> 567.92
and we got

565.6 --> 569.2
basically in a three-way call with adam

567.92 --> 571.68
meekin

569.2 --> 573.6800000000001
and that call lasted like two or three

571.68 --> 576.3199999999999
hours

573.68 --> 577.8389999999999
now luckily i wasn't the main converse i

576.32 --> 579.7600000000001
was kind of sitting

577.839 --> 581.2
it was like witnessing

579.76 --> 583.6
because it was mostly between adam

581.2 --> 585.279
meakin and dusty ryder there was a lot

583.6 --> 587.12
to discuss

585.279 --> 590.56
heavy

587.12 --> 593.36
actually a bit stressful like dusty

590.56 --> 593.3599999999999
writer's wife

593.92 --> 598.399
he went very descriptive and that was

599.36 --> 602.72
to be fair that was scary

603.6 --> 608.399
because like you know how i am i i

606.48 --> 610.9590000000001
really

608.399 --> 614.399
once you expose me to something i

610.959 --> 616.399
i can't help but get into that skin

614.399 --> 620.56
and in this case

616.399 --> 620.56
that freaked me the [ __ ] out like

621.279 --> 625.76
but

622.88 --> 627.8389999999999
there's some serious good hope though

625.76 --> 632.3199999999999
there's some serious good hope adamikin

627.839 --> 634.8800000000001
did know how to deal with the situation

632.32 --> 638.88
and so yeah there's there might actually

634.88 --> 638.88
be good hope for does the writer's wife

641.04 --> 646.959
if yeah think don't don't go in if not

643.839 --> 648.0790000000001
unexpected things start happening or

646.959 --> 650.4799999999999
right

648.079 --> 653.3599999999999
so that was tense

650.48 --> 657.6
i know frog been

653.36 --> 657.6
involved in live hangouts for

658.0 --> 662.48
eight hours

659.76 --> 662.48
ten hours

664.48 --> 668.72
yeah the flag of debates went on very

667.44 --> 670.72
long

668.72 --> 673.44
that was like a four hour show

670.72 --> 675.6800000000001
altogether so it's like six

673.44 --> 677.519
you from australia one and a half and

675.68 --> 679.04
yeah 10 hours

677.519 --> 681.2
god

679.04 --> 683.76
i was 10 hours

681.2 --> 683.76
online

686.959 --> 690.56
so i'm kind of a little bit knackered

688.959 --> 693.1199999999999
from that

690.56 --> 694.64
well not tired i feel energetic but i'm

693.12 --> 697.2
like

694.64 --> 697.1999999999999
i kind of

697.279 --> 703.279
squished my focus all i could

701.12 --> 706.9590000000001
i did get a really good rest though but

703.279 --> 710.0
i am like okay i needed like a day break

706.959 --> 712.2399999999999
or my mind is not as super active

710.0 --> 714.72
because yesterday because it was very

712.24 --> 714.72
intense

715.12 --> 719.839
but it was a great day though

717.519 --> 722.48
all together

719.839 --> 722.48
hey dank

726.72 --> 732.8000000000001
that's right the show can be about just

729.279 --> 734.959
about anything the chat wants it to be

732.8 --> 737.92
if i agree to that

734.959 --> 737.92
hey adamikin

738.32 --> 741.9200000000001
just talking about you

740.079 --> 743.3599999999999
in our conversation with dusty writer

741.92 --> 746.16
yesterday

743.36 --> 746.16
it's intense

757.36 --> 762.32
like at some point he started explaining

759.44 --> 765.44
about the condition of his wife and i i

762.32 --> 767.9200000000001
literally freaked out

765.44 --> 769.7600000000001
i i caught myself saying like dude can

767.92 --> 771.5999999999999

769.76 --> 773.68
because i got couldn't tear it couldn't

773.68 --> 775.92
out

778.88 --> 784.519
but yeah you're made of sterner stuff

781.36 --> 784.519
like that

789.76 --> 795.36
and i'm really happy you did conclude

792.48 --> 798.16
that something could be done despite the

795.36 --> 801.16
dramatic condition

798.16 --> 801.16
hoof

807.85 --> 810.94

he's notified in my favorite list my

941.92 --> 946.399
yeah ooh list of three right but he's in

944.639 --> 948.48
on my favorite channel if you go to my

946.399 --> 950.399
main page you'll see it

948.48 --> 952.48
in that list

950.399 --> 955.72
together with nathan oakley and made by

952.48 --> 955.72
jim bob

971.12 --> 974.88
what the first time you seen him on

973.519 --> 977.519
camera

974.88 --> 977.519
what do you mean

980.399 --> 983.759
first time you saw mitchell on camera

982.0 --> 985.759
he's been on camera

983.759 --> 987.92
many times

985.759 --> 992.6
although he a lot of his streams he sits

987.92 --> 992.5999999999999
behind the camera talking that's true

1001.759 --> 1006.48
yeah originally i was gonna by the way

1004.48 --> 1008.32
in on mitch's show i was gonna come on

1006.48 --> 1010.88
camera as well

1008.32 --> 1014.0
but i didn't want to like sit the whole

1010.88 --> 1016.48
time just behind the screen visible

1014.0 --> 1018.959
because i was actually i don't know if

1016.48 --> 1021.04
anybody's noticed probably not i didn't

1018.959 --> 1023.199
notice but i was kind of like well

1021.04 --> 1025.4389999999999
smoking a joint in between so it was

1023.199 --> 1028.6399999999999
like

1025.439 --> 1030.48
constantly moving around

1028.64 --> 1034.3600000000001
that would have been very distracting if

1030.48 --> 1034.3600000000001
a dad had been on camera

1038.88 --> 1044.16
dutch not like spicy food

1041.919 --> 1047.919
indian meal in amsterdam waitress was

1044.16 --> 1047.919
really surprised as for madras

1051.6 --> 1057.6789999999999
okay stone monkey 3d

1054.799 --> 1057.679
well i think that

1058.4 --> 1063.52
they're just very wary of it of super

1061.919 --> 1066.5590000000002
hot spices

1063.52 --> 1068.72
because some people probably have had

1066.559 --> 1071.52
like serious issues because of it and

1068.72 --> 1074.0
they don't want to like have somebody

1071.52 --> 1075.52
get into a serious medical emergency in

1074.0 --> 1078.24
their restaurant or something i think

1075.52 --> 1081.84
it's probably because of that

1078.24 --> 1081.84
it's liability issues

1083.76 --> 1086.799
but yeah it all depends on where you go

1085.679 --> 1089.44
though

1086.799 --> 1092.08
like if you go to a serious

1089.44 --> 1095.2
a dedicated indonesian restaurant so

1092.08 --> 1097.36
there's some out there they have the hot

1095.2 --> 1099.76
stuff they have the hottest peppers

1097.36 --> 1102.0
because hey indonesian people and

1099.76 --> 1104.32
families sometimes go there

1102.0 --> 1105.6
and yet

1104.32 --> 1106.8799999999999
well

1105.6 --> 1109.6789999999999
they like

1106.88 --> 1111.919
basically brag about or they demonstrate

1109.679 --> 1114.64
eating madame jeanettes and all that

1111.919 --> 1117.919
like just to show how tough they are and

1114.64 --> 1120.8400000000001
spices don't face them so there are hot

1117.919 --> 1123.6000000000001
spices to be found in the

1120.84 --> 1125.1999999999998
netherlands but in general

1123.6 --> 1127.12
they don't typically give you the

1125.2 --> 1130.24
hottest stuff probably because of

1127.12 --> 1130.2399999999998
liability issues

1132.559 --> 1135.559
ah

1138.08 --> 1142.8799999999999
smoking a huge nah not a huge one just

1146.4 --> 1152.48
i don't really smoke huge joints

1150.4 --> 1156.16
they make me sick

1152.48 --> 1156.16
because i don't need much

1160.0 --> 1163.6
if i smoke too much i just kind of get

1162.24 --> 1167.84
like weird

1163.6 --> 1167.84
nervous like and very distracted

1171.679 --> 1175.919
i just need very little and that's great

1174.08 --> 1179.84
it's very efficient

1175.919 --> 1184.16
it saves me a lot of money

1179.84 --> 1184.1599999999999
it's already expensive enough as it is

1185.36 --> 1189.8799999999999
if you tried edibles no i don't

1192.08 --> 1196.0
i mean i have in the past

1194.64 --> 1198.24
but

1196.0 --> 1199.76
it's very hard to size up what that'll

1198.24 --> 1201.1200000000001
do

1199.76 --> 1202.1589999999999
and it's

1201.12 --> 1203.28
yeah

1202.159 --> 1205.2800000000002
i'm

1203.28 --> 1207.44
like it's

1205.28 --> 1208.559
i'm sensitive

1207.44 --> 1212.0800000000002
to it

1208.559 --> 1214.96
and so if like the dose is too much

1212.08 --> 1219.6399999999999
then suddenly yeah you get just super

1214.96 --> 1219.64
super hammered and i don't like that

1220.0 --> 1223.28
i don't think that's funny

1232.799 --> 1235.799
right

1244.96 --> 1250.32
i went for a trip once

1247.12 --> 1253.12
dude i don't need to like go overkill to

1250.32 --> 1253.12
go on a trip

1254.96 --> 1259.44
like i

1257.12 --> 1261.84
i call it dreamwalking and i do that

1259.44 --> 1263.6000000000001
constantly especially in the evening i'm

1261.84 --> 1265.76
just like

1263.6 --> 1268.24
listening to media

1265.76 --> 1270.4
thinking about things

1268.24 --> 1273.039
smoking some

1270.4 --> 1274.48
not too much and then just like walking

1273.039 --> 1275.76
back and forth thinking thinking

1274.48 --> 1279.919
thinking

1275.76 --> 1279.919
getting all extra dimensional in my mind

1281.919 --> 1285.5200000000002
that's

1282.88 --> 1286.5590000000002
that would probably classify as tripping

1285.52 --> 1289.44
but

1286.559 --> 1292.1589999999999
it's not out of control

1289.44 --> 1294.159
it's actually become very common thing

1292.159 --> 1296.7990000000002
for me to do

1294.159 --> 1300.72
like so common i can almost

1296.799 --> 1303.84
like it's a skill there you go

1300.72 --> 1306.08
like a collector call it dreamwalking

1303.84 --> 1309.12
deep deep thinking on a level that most

1306.08 --> 1309.12
people aren't used to

1310.08 --> 1314.48
and i do it daily i've been doing that

1314.88 --> 1318.6000000000001
since i was five

1320.159 --> 1325.2
basically since i first really woke up

1322.64 --> 1326.7990000000002
in my consciousness and and hey my

1325.2 --> 1329.3600000000001
especially my mother but my both my

1326.799 --> 1331.9189999999999
parents really recognized that i had

1329.36 --> 1334.32
that and then encouraged me to do that

1331.919 --> 1336.5590000000002
they encouraged me to like train my

1334.32 --> 1338.24
dreaming

1336.559 --> 1340.48
which is quite

1338.24 --> 1344.0
bizarre in a way it is like almost like

1340.48 --> 1346.48
oh it's liberal but they really meant it

1344.0 --> 1348.4
and i really recognized it and i took it

1346.48 --> 1349.3600000000001
very seriously i was like no this is a

1348.4 --> 1352.159
skill

1349.36 --> 1354.4799999999998
i'm very young it's very fresh

1352.159 --> 1356.3200000000002
i have to learn to do that

1354.48 --> 1357.679
and not get

1356.32 --> 1361.28
like

1357.679 --> 1363.039
getting lost in it also very important

1361.28 --> 1365.28
and that would happen a lot more when i

1363.039 --> 1368.24
was a young kid i would get lost in my

1365.28 --> 1370.48
dreams and like end up in fear and all

1368.24 --> 1370.48
that

1371.679 --> 1376.0
but

1373.679 --> 1378.0800000000002
i've trained on that most of my life and

1376.0 --> 1380.48
i think i pretty much got out of that

1378.08 --> 1380.48
after

1384.799 --> 1388.44
when did i truly

1388.72 --> 1391.679
yeah

1390.4 --> 1394.0
locked it

1391.679 --> 1397.2
when i get control i think it would like

1394.0 --> 1398.96
must be around when it was 25

1397.2 --> 1401.6000000000001
before that it was already getting there

1398.96 --> 1404.96
but it was still like unlocked

1401.6 --> 1404.9599999999998
was still a little wild and

1405.2 --> 1410.72
like i thought yeah it's so complicated

1407.76 --> 1410.72
to talk about that but

1410.799 --> 1414.48
yeah you can't get lost when you're

1412.24 --> 1416.32
dream walking

1414.48 --> 1419.6
i've done it a lot i've explored the

1416.32 --> 1423.799
dreamscapes a lot and

1419.6 --> 1423.799
i don't get lost anymore

1432.799 --> 1435.279
anyway

1441.36 --> 1445.84
drank one white claw last night

1449.6 --> 1452.7199999999998
really okay

1452.88 --> 1457.3600000000001
if you don't like beer then yeah you

1455.2 --> 1459.76
don't like beer and especially if you if

1457.36 --> 1462.9599999999998
you're not used to drinking it it's very

1459.76 --> 1465.96
unlikely you'll like the taste

1462.96 --> 1465.96
really

1475.679 --> 1479.6000000000001
and i don't i don't even know like the

1477.44 --> 1480.88
white claw brand what type of beer that

1479.6 --> 1483.1999999999998
is

1480.88 --> 1486.0800000000002
it's not organic for sure

1483.2 --> 1489.679
i wouldn't touch non-organic beer like

1486.08 --> 1489.6789999999999
not even if i get paid for it

1498.64 --> 1503.48
a good servant by the way

1519.36 --> 1522.9599999999998
other spell costing by

1523.36 --> 1528.4399999999998
also they're a recent type of bear

1530.32 --> 1534.0
uh

1531.12 --> 1537.1999999999998
this got pop well dude ralph rodriguez

1534.0 --> 1540.32
uh hello owen benjamin

1537.2 --> 1540.32
drank white claw

1540.4 --> 1543.3600000000001
a lot

1541.44 --> 1545.6000000000001
like during the streams

1543.36 --> 1548.0
during his comedy he's been doing that

1545.6 --> 1550.48
for years

1548.0 --> 1552.799
and then he yeah i got into flat earth

1550.48 --> 1556.1200000000001
and then he kind of like decided to stop

1552.799 --> 1556.12
doing that

1556.48 --> 1559.84
but he used to drink white claw all the

1558.64 --> 1562.4
time

1559.84 --> 1564.559
so that might be a contributor to why i

1562.4 --> 1567.039
got very popular

1564.559 --> 1567.039
i don't know

1568.4 --> 1573.6000000000001
it's not a dutch brand or anything so i

1571.039 --> 1578.279
i i don't think i've ever even seen it

1573.6 --> 1578.279
in the store here so whatever

1591.84 --> 1594.84
huh

1610.08 --> 1613.08
uh

1621.84 --> 1629.279
the weather's so good

1625.12 --> 1629.279
i can't believe how wind still it is

1632.64 --> 1637.6000000000001
it's like i'm looking carefully and just

1634.96 --> 1639.52
can't see a single leaf move

1637.6 --> 1640.7199999999998
oh now it's the sun something is

1639.52 --> 1643.12
starting to move

1640.72 --> 1645.919
it's like you gotta look very careful at

1643.12 --> 1648.8799999999999
times because it gets so wind still

1645.919 --> 1648.88
it's just amazing

1650.0 --> 1654.36
all right let's get a look

1684.799 --> 1687.799
um

1701.679 --> 1705.52
oh wow good servant really

1706.0 --> 1711.48
well maybe they had some kind of a

1707.44 --> 1711.48
sponsorship thing going

1712.0 --> 1716.32
i mean if it's a group of cute looking

1714.96 --> 1718.88
girls

1716.32 --> 1721.52
constantly holding that well that would

1718.88 --> 1724.159
sell by classical terms so maybe they

1721.52 --> 1725.679
got like sponsorship

1724.159 --> 1727.679
and we're like okay girls we're just

1725.679 --> 1729.44
gonna party we're gonna drink white claw

1727.679 --> 1730.96
and always get a picture with the white

1729.44 --> 1732.559
claw

1730.96 --> 1735.679
and then we send a picture to the

1732.559 --> 1736.72
advertisers and then we get like

1735.679 --> 1740.24
i don't know

1736.72 --> 1742.64
50 discount or maybe a 100 discount or

1740.24 --> 1744.48
maybe like free beer and even some extra

1742.64 --> 1745.6000000000001
money who knows

1744.48 --> 1749.72
you know

1745.6 --> 1749.7199999999998
that's like typical advertisement

1750.72 --> 1754.559
things

1752.96 --> 1756.08
there's a lot of it happening out there

1754.559 --> 1759.44
by the way

1756.08 --> 1759.4399999999998
it kind of works like that

1763.52 --> 1767.24
anyway uh

1782.72 --> 1785.1200000000001
what

1788.799 --> 1793.84
oh wow

1790.88 --> 1797.44
i'm almost hitting the

1793.84 --> 1798.799
70 to 2070 subs now it's

1797.44 --> 1800.96
taking off

1798.799 --> 1804.1589999999999
could also be that the trolls are just

1800.96 --> 1806.159
like oh oh look we're gonna do it again

1804.159 --> 1807.679
and that they'll go down again to like

1806.159 --> 1809.679
240.

1807.679 --> 1811.279
no it's not it wouldn't be the first

1809.679 --> 1814.88
time

1811.279 --> 1814.88
so i'm prepared for anything

1816.559 --> 1821.48
they typically do like to play that game

1848.32 --> 1851.559
all right

1854.32 --> 1857.36
hey

1856.0 --> 1859.039

1873.12 --> 1879.84
subscribe as a seer

1876.08 --> 1879.84
isn't that like level three

1880.32 --> 1883.4399999999998

or can't even check the button

1920.0 --> 1926.88
to become a member of my channel myself

1922.159 --> 1929.1200000000001

2078.0 --> 2080.8
totally different

2084.24 --> 2087.9599999999996
check skype what

2093.839 --> 2098.7999999999997
oh

2095.919 --> 2098.7999999999997
oh thanks adam

2099.599 --> 2102.599
right

2103.76 --> 2107.3590000000004
i did manage to find it by the way but i

2105.599 --> 2109.839
had to really dig

2107.359 --> 2112.96
like click on five times to get there

2109.839 --> 2112.96
but thanks for that

2113.2 --> 2117.839
adam just made a photograph of it

2128.079 --> 2134.6400000000003
if the year 2021 is the year of the sex

2131.2 --> 2136.7999999999997
and what will year 2022 be well nathan

2134.64 --> 2139.839
oakley has already declared it to be the

2136.8 --> 2139.8390000000004
year of the sun

2142.96 --> 2147.359
and i

2144.4 --> 2147.359
i don't object

2148.32 --> 2154.119
i have a lot to say about the sun as

2150.56 --> 2154.119
everybody knows

2170.8 --> 2173.8
right

2190.32 --> 2195.48
it's over there yeah that's what i like

2192.32 --> 2195.48
to say

2200.24 --> 2206.16
it's also funny because when you say

2202.72 --> 2208.64
this i choose my words very carefully

2206.16 --> 2209.839
on an intuitive letter level and then

2208.64 --> 2211.839
later

2209.839 --> 2214.0
i can actually describe it

2211.839 --> 2216.0789999999997
my intuition does everything for me it's

2214.0 --> 2218.079
like sometimes i feel like it's not even

2216.079 --> 2222.079
me the guy that's actually talking to

2218.079 --> 2224.079
you that's not the that's not the person

2222.079 --> 2228.599
that's not the consciousness position of

2224.079 --> 2228.599
who's making these decisions here

2228.64 --> 2231.359
sounds a bit weird when i say it like

2230.24 --> 2232.3199999999997
that

2231.359 --> 2236.48
right

2232.32 --> 2237.76
but it's over there really works because

2236.48 --> 2240.48
it is

2237.76 --> 2242.48
it's kind of a word trick

2240.48 --> 2243.599
because when you say it's over there

2242.48 --> 2246.16
that can

2243.599 --> 2248.079
be mean anything

2246.16 --> 2250.16
you're not being specific as to a

2248.079 --> 2252.7200000000003
position so it doesn't automatically

2250.16 --> 2253.68
imply euclidean nature

2252.72 --> 2257.7999999999997
but

2253.68 --> 2257.7999999999997
it could mean it

2257.839 --> 2263.2799999999997
it doesn't necessarily exclude it

2260.56 --> 2263.2799999999997
isn't that funny

2269.359 --> 2274.16
oh thank you america silver patriot for

2271.839 --> 2276.72
a ten dollar super chat donation

2274.16 --> 2278.7999999999997
2021 is the year we kick the globers in

2276.72 --> 2280.48
the balls

2278.8 --> 2282.6400000000003
i think every year is the year we kick

2280.48 --> 2285.839
glovers in the balls they get kicked in

2282.64 --> 2285.839
the balls all the time

2289.28 --> 2291.8390000000004
like

2290.16 --> 2293.5989999999997
it's it's starting to get to the point

2291.839 --> 2296.24
where we have to back the question

2293.599 --> 2297.599
whether they even have any balls left to

2296.24 --> 2300.3999999999996
kick

2297.599 --> 2300.4
you know what i mean

2302.0 --> 2305.44
because if you're gonna kick balls at

2303.599 --> 2309.32
some point there's gonna be no more

2305.44 --> 2309.32
balls left to kick

2319.44 --> 2324.96
hey julio pebbin

2322.56 --> 2329.32
can't wait till the date of sun rises in

2324.96 --> 2329.32
the west and sets in the east what

2343.44 --> 2349.359
sometimes they get tea bagged yeah but

2347.2 --> 2351.5989999999997
they don't need balls for that all they

2349.359 --> 2354.5989999999997
need is a face

2351.599 --> 2354.599
right

2358.16 --> 2362.2
hello my moon buggy

2369.839 --> 2373.68
yeah bobby stills

2372.079 --> 2375.6800000000003
strange

2373.68 --> 2378.7999999999997
looking facey there

2375.68 --> 2382.7599999999998
like questioning facey yeah we know yeah

2378.8 --> 2382.76
you don't have any balls

2385.119 --> 2387.839
not anymore

2388.24 --> 2393.9199999999996
i mean the balls in your mind are burst

2391.04 --> 2397.839
and i think your actual balls by now are

2393.92 --> 2397.839
must also been burst

2399.68 --> 2405.7999999999997
because you act like a rag doll in gamer

2402.8 --> 2405.8
terminology

2414.8 --> 2419.5600000000004
yeah

2415.76 --> 2419.5600000000004
hey slow mo moon buggy

2425.68 --> 2430.7999999999997
and there you go

2427.52 --> 2432.4
it's the laughing rag doll

2430.8 --> 2435.44
does it

2432.4 --> 2437.92
gets slung around limbs flopping all

2435.44 --> 2439.839
over the place getting twisted and he's

2437.92 --> 2441.92
laughing at it while it's happening to

2439.839 --> 2444.72
him

2441.92 --> 2447.839
yeah we know

2444.72 --> 2447.839
it's very funny to you

2448.24 --> 2451.04
i mean yeah what else are you gonna do

2449.92 --> 2453.44
but laugh

2451.04 --> 2456.16
over your fate you know it is kind of

2453.44 --> 2460.04
funny it's just

2456.16 --> 2460.04
ah never mind

2468.079 --> 2474.4
it's why i'm your favorite what because

2471.52 --> 2477.2
i describe you as a

2474.4 --> 2481.319
cackling rag doll that gets kicked all

2477.2 --> 2481.319
over the place okay

2481.599 --> 2486.8
i guess you have a need

2484.319 --> 2488.079
to be a rag doll kicked all over the

2486.8 --> 2490.319
place

2488.079 --> 2493.04
that by the way makes you kind of a

2490.319 --> 2493.04
masochist

2493.52 --> 2499.7599999999998
and a bit of a [ __ ]

2496.0 --> 2499.76
i've called you out on that before

2500.319 --> 2504.079
i might want to do something about that

2505.92 --> 2508.64
my

2506.839 --> 2512.24
comedy

2508.64 --> 2512.24
nah my comedy

2513.359 --> 2518.64
okay so you think it's funny

2516.079 --> 2521.76
how i describe that but as soon as i pin

2518.64 --> 2524.16
down that i'm actually talking about you

2521.76 --> 2526.48
that's not funny

2524.16 --> 2530.3999999999996
like do you have like some kind of a

2526.48 --> 2532.0
split personality attention disorder

2530.4 --> 2534.7200000000003
it's like yeah

2532.0 --> 2537.599
the comedy is about you

2534.72 --> 2540.9599999999996
that's funny but when you realize it's

2537.599 --> 2542.48
about you then it's not funny

2540.96 --> 2547.319
i think might be having a little

2542.48 --> 2547.319
cognitive dissonance problem there bobby

2553.839 --> 2557.44
that's not how any of that works sticks

2556.0 --> 2560.24
and stones right

2557.44 --> 2562.56
well you gotta have bones left

2560.24 --> 2564.24
to break

2562.56 --> 2566.88
by the sticks and stones otherwise

2564.24 --> 2569.9199999999996
you're just going to be a ragdoll while

2566.88 --> 2569.92
flopping around

2573.44 --> 2578.599
no it's still funny

2575.599 --> 2578.599
okay

2590.64 --> 2593.839
hello moon shadow

2593.92 --> 2598.88
hello nathan oakley

2596.16 --> 2598.8799999999997
good to see you

2601.119 --> 2604.7200000000003
how's the weather over there is it as

2602.88 --> 2606.319
gorgeous as it is here look at this

2604.72 --> 2609.1189999999997
nathan

2606.319 --> 2609.119
just look at that

2614.96 --> 2621.599
this is definitely one of those days

2616.8 --> 2626.04
where i can say the sun is over there

2621.599 --> 2626.04
nothing in blocking this one

2639.52 --> 2644.599
talk about balls that he's sure to

2641.599 --> 2644.599
appear

2648.72 --> 2653.5989999999997
yeah where nathan's balls go

2651.92 --> 2655.52
getting called by tea bagging

2653.599 --> 2658.52
opportunities nathan of course has to

2655.52 --> 2658.52
follow

2665.119 --> 2670.6400000000003
can you sing run from r

2668.0 --> 2670.64
oh god

2670.8 --> 2673.599
ah really

2673.76 --> 2677.7200000000003
i guess i could do it

2678.72 --> 2683.839
although normally i don't really do

2680.48 --> 2683.839
requests like that

2686.319 --> 2691.359
hope my voice is good enough to carry

2688.8 --> 2693.599
that

2691.359 --> 2695.359
because i have been roughly talking for

2693.599 --> 2696.88
like 10 hours

2695.359 --> 2699.04
yesterday

2696.88 --> 2699.04
so

2701.2 --> 2708.24
okay so here we

2702.839 --> 2711.119
go run run run away run away from r

2708.24 --> 2712.9599999999996
merrily merrily merrily the horizon

2711.119 --> 2717.44
can't be far

2712.96 --> 2720.2400000000002
run run run away run away from r

2717.44 --> 2722.7200000000003
merrily merrily merrily the horizon

2720.24 --> 2725.2799999999997
can't be far

2722.72 --> 2725.2799999999997
there you go

2726.96 --> 2730.64
and technically you could loop that and

2728.72 --> 2734.0789999999997
you could probably play

2730.64 --> 2736.48
mice that same line over itself to make

2734.079 --> 2737.8390000000004
it into the cannon

2736.48 --> 2741.319
if you like to

2737.839 --> 2741.319
i don't mind

2748.88 --> 2752.4
okay that got some attention

2759.04 --> 2764.16
hmm what

2762.16 --> 2767.839
sleeping war yeah sleeping warrior gets

2764.16 --> 2767.839
a little ban happy sometimes

2769.44 --> 2777.44
did you say something stupid moonshadow

2774.0 --> 2777.44
it's not like you're perfect

2777.92 --> 2782.96
but like if you're gonna add home him

2780.16 --> 2785.2
about something even slightly then if

2782.96 --> 2788.68
he's in the wrong mood he will typically

2785.2 --> 2788.68
just kick people

2793.76 --> 2798.079
wow it has the horizon in this she

2795.839 --> 2801.88
didn't hear that before

2798.079 --> 2801.88
yeah it does of course

2804.079 --> 2808.48
right that's where they're supposed to

2805.52 --> 2811.68
be getting r from from the horizon

2808.48 --> 2814.0
that's how they measured it

2811.68 --> 2815.68
in order to be able to calculate

2814.0 --> 2817.599
the radius value

2815.68 --> 2819.68
i have to base it on the real world

2817.599 --> 2822.48
measurement and that measurement is

2819.68 --> 2824.96
based on the horizon assuming

2822.48 --> 2824.96
it is

2825.359 --> 2830.2799999999997
the

2826.4 --> 2830.28
edge of a sphere

2832.319 --> 2835.8
oh all right

2858.64 --> 2862.8199999999997
all right well moonshot yeah nice and

2860.88 --> 2865.899
ugly

wait

3008.079 --> 3015.2000000000003
come on ctrl f right and you look for

3011.44 --> 3016.079
the name so it's just like moon

3015.2 --> 3017.7599999999998
moon

3016.079 --> 3020.319
shadow

3017.76 --> 3022.559
oh moon shadow doesn't seem to be in the

3020.319 --> 3022.5589999999997
list

3023.599 --> 3028.7200000000003
oh yeah it doesn't seem to be you have

3026.24 --> 3030.0789999999997
to click in the right box for that to

3028.72 --> 3032.24
work though

3030.079 --> 3034.6400000000003
but it's not in here this is an easy way

3032.24 --> 3037.1189999999997
to find it quickly if you want to unban

3034.64 --> 3039.2799999999997
somebody specifically

3037.119 --> 3042.96
right it's not

3039.28 --> 3042.96
as not that hard

3043.44 --> 3046.44
right

3059.68 --> 3062.96
next on the pc oh you're not at the

3061.839 --> 3066.119
computer

3062.96 --> 3066.119
all right

3072.8 --> 3078.079
rat man daniel dude there's

3075.76 --> 3081.0400000000004
seed planting there's like so many sock

3078.079 --> 3083.28
trolls in there by now it's crazy

3081.04 --> 3085.92
so you're going to see like sock trolls

3083.28 --> 3088.4
and based on names of real character and

3085.92 --> 3090.2400000000002
slightly change and all that

3088.4 --> 3092.2400000000002
ass hat man that

3090.24 --> 3096.04
whatever you can think of it's probably

3092.24 --> 3096.04
in that list by now

3115.599 --> 3121.7200000000003
yeah you no problem moon shadow i

3117.2 --> 3121.72
appreciate your presence here in my chat

3166.48 --> 3169.44
man time has flown

3177.28 --> 3180.88
right

3178.88 --> 3184.2400000000002
pondering whether i should be just doing

3180.88 --> 3186.2400000000002
five more minutes or 35 more minutes but

3184.24 --> 3187.7599999999998
i kind of had planned not to do a super

3186.24 --> 3190.4799999999996
long show today

3187.76 --> 3193.48
because i had 10 hours of live streaming

3190.48 --> 3193.48
yesterday

3195.119 --> 3200.079
a job interview today okay

3197.839 --> 3202.88
you're good yeah dude i'm great

3200.079 --> 3207.04
been streaming for 10 hours yesterday

3202.88 --> 3210.319
all together it's like busiest

3207.04 --> 3214.44
day online i've had

3210.319 --> 3214.44
in at least a year time

3225.119 --> 3230.079
that wasn't flat earth debates

3227.52 --> 3232.4
after show lasted very long it was all

3230.079 --> 3234.4
together a four-hour show

3232.4 --> 3236.2400000000002
and then mitchell from australia later

3234.4 --> 3239.76
that evening

3236.24 --> 3241.7599999999998
and then even after that one half hours

3239.76 --> 3243.6800000000003
extra

3241.76 --> 3245.8390000000004
yeah after that still had like a three

3243.68 --> 3248.24
hour conversation with dusty ryder and

3245.839 --> 3250.7999999999997
adam meekin

3248.24 --> 3253.4399999999996
about medical issues

3250.8 --> 3253.44
so man

3254.079 --> 3257.44
i need a mute break

3259.359 --> 3264.5589999999997
i'm kind of happy that today there isn't

3261.44 --> 3266.559
a ball buster's life

3264.559 --> 3268.6400000000003
because that was last week i'm not

3266.559 --> 3270.48
mistaken

3268.64 --> 3273.2799999999997
and if there will be then maybe i'll

3270.48 --> 3276.28
just get on that anyway

3273.28 --> 3276.28
uh

3285.119 --> 3289.44
okay ralph rodriguez that's terrible

3289.839 --> 3293.0789999999997
like seriously

3297.76 --> 3302.079
if it doesn't rhyme it makes no sense

3303.76 --> 3308.3190000000004
the song got stuck yeah but that's not

3305.599 --> 3308.319
how it goes

3310.079 --> 3316.44
you got the wrong song in your head it

3312.4 --> 3316.44
doesn't even rhyme man

3327.119 --> 3331.799
all right let me type out the lyrics

3340.61 --> 3344.32
[Applause]

3347.839 --> 3349.92
you

3353.04 --> 3356.13
[Applause]

3359.2 --> 3366.0099999999998
[Applause]

3384.24 --> 3388.8799999999997
hey guns in the front rmp

3387.2 --> 3391.839
good to see you

3388.88 --> 3391.839
yeah a little late

3392.079 --> 3397.52
it was a great shot today though

3394.799 --> 3397.52
it's just nice

3402.88 --> 3408.799
oh my god fight the flat earth on

3406.319 --> 3411.119
modern day debates oh

3408.799 --> 3414.319
why

3411.119 --> 3417.359
oh my god i don't even need a report

3414.319 --> 3419.359
you like any of these types of guys you

3417.359 --> 3422.319
don't need

3419.359 --> 3425.44
to get a report to know exactly what

3422.319 --> 3427.599
will have happened like

3425.44 --> 3429.68
seriously guys

3427.599 --> 3430.88
these anti-flat earthers are such

3429.68 --> 3432.8799999999997
cartoons

3430.88 --> 3434.319
there's literally nothing that could

3432.88 --> 3436.319
they could do

3434.319 --> 3438.64
that would surprise you

3436.319 --> 3441.04
if you actually figured it out like what

3438.64 --> 3441.04
they do

3442.559 --> 3446.7200000000003
like

3444.16 --> 3448.799
you could be like a script like i think

3446.72 --> 3450.24
this is probably testable if you just

3448.799 --> 3452.64
got to know them

3450.24 --> 3454.319
over the interactions over a period like

3452.64 --> 3455.52
a year you got to know them through

3454.319 --> 3457.92
flatter debates through other

3455.52 --> 3461.28
confrontations through their videos you

3457.92 --> 3463.76
could just like okay i'm completely

3461.28 --> 3465.8390000000004
cutting them off like not going to any

3463.76 --> 3467.5200000000004
videos not reading any of their chats

3465.839 --> 3470.0
absolutely nothing

3467.52 --> 3471.92
for like half a year straight

3470.0 --> 3473.68
and then you could literally just like

3471.92 --> 3475.359
hear oh

3473.68 --> 3477.1189999999997
he went

3475.359 --> 3478.48
on this and that against the flat

3477.119 --> 3481.04
earther

3478.48 --> 3483.52
you don't if you could just write the

3481.04 --> 3485.52
script of what he's gonna do

3483.52 --> 3487.2
it's so predictable

3485.52 --> 3488.96
like you can

3487.2 --> 3492.72
now just

3488.96 --> 3494.64
predict everything they do

3492.72 --> 3496.319
there's no surprises coming from them

3494.64 --> 3497.5989999999997
anymore

3496.319 --> 3499.359
because they have very little

3497.599 --> 3504.2400000000002
maneuvering room left so they're just

3499.359 --> 3504.24
gonna do the same thing again and again

3504.799 --> 3510.48
same manipulations same

3507.52 --> 3512.799
mistakes same oh oh we're just gonna

3510.48 --> 3515.04
move away from that always the same

3512.799 --> 3519.599
everything the same

3515.04 --> 3519.599
they are like bots except they're people

3520.319 --> 3523.7599999999998
people that have reprogrammed themselves

3522.4 --> 3527.6800000000003
like bots

3523.76 --> 3529.0400000000004
fully automated very little choice

3527.68 --> 3531.839
making

3529.04 --> 3531.839
in the process

3536.24 --> 3540.9599999999996
it's always this yeah it is isn't it

3538.4 --> 3544.92
like i haven't seen it but i know

3540.96 --> 3544.92
i'm right about this

3546.64 --> 3550.8799999999997
that's right

3548.079 --> 3554.079
they of course flat earth is dumb

3550.88 --> 3555.76
they start they don't bring up detailed

3554.079 --> 3558.6400000000003
counter arguments

3555.76 --> 3560.96
but if those are brought up

3558.64 --> 3563.2799999999997
then they will just roll out their crazy

3560.96 --> 3566.7200000000003
machinations that make no sense and get

3563.28 --> 3566.7200000000003
outraged start spamming

3567.04 --> 3571.839
and then be very willing to agree like

3569.839 --> 3574.5589999999997
okay let's agree to disagree or

3571.839 --> 3576.88
something and move on right they always

3574.559 --> 3579.2000000000003
do that always

3576.88 --> 3581.359
so predictable you don't have to watch

3579.2 --> 3583.2
anything they do

3581.359 --> 3585.2
for a long time

3583.2 --> 3587.839
and still be and you'll still be able to

3585.2 --> 3589.9199999999996
predict exactly what they're going to do

3587.839 --> 3593.2
and how

3589.92 --> 3595.28
because they're they're like bots

3593.2 --> 3597.359
they're fully automated they don't have

3595.28 --> 3598.3190000000004
a lot of choice making

3597.359 --> 3601.839
left

3598.319 --> 3601.839
to do in what they do

3605.76 --> 3609.28
all right thank you

3607.52 --> 3611.68
america silver patriot for being there

3609.28 --> 3615.8390000000004
and becoming a seer member

3611.68 --> 3618.319
my chat hope to see you again soon

3615.839 --> 3619.359
everything was pretty yeah but duh

3618.319 --> 3622.319
of course

3619.359 --> 3622.319
that's that that's

3622.72 --> 3628.16
if there was another option besides

3625.92 --> 3630.559
everything being presupposed i think

3628.16 --> 3632.48
they would have taken it by now

3630.559 --> 3634.799
i mean i

3632.48 --> 3636.64
would have taken it as baldwin by now

3634.799 --> 3640.72
and i am attempting it i'm still

3636.64 --> 3640.72
attempting to basically just still

3641.119 --> 3644.96
keep my r and eat it too

3645.92 --> 3651.04
right

3647.92 --> 3654.76
i'm kind of like a spy like that except

3651.04 --> 3654.7599999999998
yeah you need me

3656.4 --> 3661.04
what are they gonna do anyway like even

3658.319 --> 3664.16
if i did discover these things it's not

3661.04 --> 3666.24
gonna help them win

3664.16 --> 3668.16
it doesn't matter anymore the war is

3666.24 --> 3671.68
over

3668.16 --> 3674.0789999999997
the war about the technicals is over it

3671.68 --> 3676.48
is over completely

3674.079 --> 3679.04
all that it is now is just a political

3676.48 --> 3681.76
struggle between those

3679.04 --> 3681.7599999999998
that are just

3681.839 --> 3686.64
into the truth and figuring things out

3684.16 --> 3688.799
and those that don't

3686.64 --> 3692.0789999999997
want to move on

3688.799 --> 3693.68
from the ball conception

3692.079 --> 3695.76
and they're just

3693.68 --> 3696.5589999999997
stand there just they'll just keep doing

3695.76 --> 3698.4
that

3696.559 --> 3700.7200000000003
they're not gonna maneuver they're just

3698.4 --> 3703.92
gonna keep doing that like even though

3700.72 --> 3705.9199999999996
they have lost absolutely definitively

3703.92 --> 3707.92
irrevocably

3705.92 --> 3710.4
the earth is not a ball it can never

3707.92 --> 3713.599
turn out to be a ball ever no matter

3710.4 --> 3717.119
what you do no matter what you do

3713.599 --> 3719.76
in physical reality the earth will never

3717.119 --> 3721.2000000000003
turn out to be a ball no matter what you

3719.76 --> 3725.48
do

3721.2 --> 3725.48
but you can keep the dream going

3727.68 --> 3731.5989999999997
i had i do not object to that

3730.319 --> 3733.359
it's just like yeah what are you going

3731.599 --> 3735.6800000000003
to do with that dream you're going to be

3733.359 --> 3738.0789999999997
a godless

3735.68 --> 3740.96
life-sucking demon

3738.079 --> 3744.1600000000003
and just parasite and behave terribly

3740.96 --> 3746.16
and manipulatively and egotistically

3744.16 --> 3747.92
just because you think you can because

3746.16 --> 3750.0789999999997
you truly believe there is no god and

3747.92 --> 3753.039
there's no consequences to things

3750.079 --> 3755.2000000000003
right well then you can [ __ ] off

3753.039 --> 3756.3190000000004
but if you are willing to uphold the

3755.2 --> 3758.3999999999996
dream

3756.319 --> 3760.48
and with the dream

3758.4 --> 3762.88
carry and teach some

3760.48 --> 3765.68
forms of nobility and just basic common

3762.88 --> 3766.48
decency and freedom then i am all up for

3765.68 --> 3770.24
it

3766.48 --> 3770.2400000000002
i'm like yeah sure

3778.559 --> 3782.4
right because the globe

3781.119 --> 3784.4
the globe

3782.4 --> 3786.799
system the global leaf it's just a

3784.4 --> 3788.319
medium it's just a medium to do things

3786.799 --> 3790.48
in what are you going to do with that

3788.319 --> 3792.7599999999998
medium right that medium provides even

3790.48 --> 3794.319
freedom from god

3792.76 --> 3797.28
philosophically

3794.319 --> 3800.96
if you want that you can choose to be an

3797.28 --> 3803.8390000000004
atheist scumbag within its conception

3800.96 --> 3806.0
it's kind of made for that option

3803.839 --> 3808.4
like it is made to have that as a

3806.0 --> 3810.64
possibility within it but that doesn't

3808.4 --> 3812.7200000000003
mean you have to choose that and that's

3810.64 --> 3814.0789999999997
why there's still plenty of globe

3812.72 --> 3816.16
believers

3814.079 --> 3818.0
that absolutely believe in god and a

3816.16 --> 3820.16
creator

3818.0 --> 3821.599
behind that and they're like yeah yeah

3820.16 --> 3822.64
yeah god could have made it like that

3821.599 --> 3824.4
you know

3822.64 --> 3827.0389999999998
they don't understand the mechanics but

3824.4 --> 3828.799
they still know like yeah yeah no i am

3827.039 --> 3831.28
def definitely a god

3828.799 --> 3832.72
definitely a creator he he may have he

3831.28 --> 3834.7200000000003
made it like that

3832.72 --> 3836.0789999999997
there's a reason for things because of

3834.72 --> 3838.319
his design

3836.079 --> 3840.1600000000003
that's kind of how i was before i

3838.319 --> 3841.119
figured out that the earth is actually

3840.16 --> 3843.68
flat

3841.119 --> 3847.6800000000003
and not that glow

3843.68 --> 3851.16
so it all depends what are you gonna do

3847.68 --> 3851.16
with the medium

3878.4 --> 3882.1600000000003
all right

3879.68 --> 3884.64
yeah thanks pg crew shank yeah it was it

3882.16 --> 3884.64
was great

3884.799 --> 3888.839
it was great being on there

3909.599 --> 3912.559
oh wow really

3915.2 --> 3920.48
okay a single cell organism has more

3917.76 --> 3922.4
moving parts than new york city somebody

3920.48 --> 3925.359
had to organize yeah

3922.4 --> 3926.559
dude what happens in the micro

3925.359 --> 3928.0789999999997
cosm of

3926.559 --> 3932.3190000000004
life is

3928.079 --> 3932.319
is well literally mind blowing

3934.16 --> 3937.92
right

3934.96 --> 3940.0
i personally am a big fan of the saying

3937.92 --> 3942.559
that comes from that from those types of

3940.0 --> 3944.24
realizations i don't know who it's a

3942.559 --> 3947.2400000000002
quote from somebody i don't remember who

3944.24 --> 3947.24
but

3950.48 --> 3953.92
like if the brain

3953.039 --> 3955.5200000000004
was

3953.92 --> 3958.079
simple enough

3955.52 --> 3960.72
for us to understand

3958.079 --> 3964.599
then we would be too simple

3960.72 --> 3964.5989999999997
to understand it

3964.64 --> 3969.5989999999997
i love it it's kind of a it's like a

3967.2 --> 3971.68
consciousness paradox thing

3969.599 --> 3975.119
but it is true it's like the biology

3971.68 --> 3977.359
that we are is beyond us like we could

3975.119 --> 3980.319
never have designed anything to this

3977.359 --> 3981.2799999999997
scale with this precision and this scope

3980.319 --> 3983.599
ever

3981.28 --> 3986.96
could never do that

3983.599 --> 3988.6400000000003
like our consciousness are not

3986.96 --> 3990.4
broad enough

3988.64 --> 3992.4
to normally do that

3990.4 --> 3994.7200000000003
you have to be

3992.4 --> 3996.079
well more than human

3994.72 --> 3998.16
or well

3996.079 --> 4000.4
god

3998.16 --> 4002.24
the knower of all

4000.4 --> 4004.079
you'd have to be the knower of all

4002.24 --> 4005.839
things all information

4004.079 --> 4008.2400000000002
throughout all time

4005.839 --> 4010.88
in order to get anywhere close to being

4008.24 --> 4014.64
able to design something like that

4010.88 --> 4016.7200000000003
and we aren't we are just

4014.64 --> 4019.44
temporary beings

4016.72 --> 4022.16
that have a fragment of the spirit

4019.44 --> 4026.28
that created us

4022.16 --> 4026.2799999999997
and we're being tested

4053.599 --> 4058.88
yeah mitchell yeah mitchell is is uh

4056.799 --> 4059.599
well he does flat earth school

4058.88 --> 4064.799
and

4059.599 --> 4064.799
it's it's basics like mitchell's show is

4064.88 --> 4069.359
it's

4066.559 --> 4069.3590000000004
i call that

4070.4 --> 4073.839
it's

4071.44 --> 4076.48
the way he formats it also very

4073.839 --> 4079.599
carefully picking his words and all that

4076.48 --> 4081.599
it's pretty much for all ages like it is

4079.599 --> 4084.079
suitable for little kids how he does his

4081.599 --> 4086.559
show i think

4084.079 --> 4090.039
compared to me like i get pretty rough i

4086.559 --> 4090.039
tackle really

4090.079 --> 4093.6800000000003
heavy

4091.119 --> 4095.359
dark or even like a heavy heavily angry

4093.68 --> 4096.159
subject sometimes

4095.359 --> 4098.64
like

4096.159 --> 4099.599999999999
mitchell is really about the education

4098.64 --> 4101.6
and

4099.6 --> 4102.719
it gets pretty technical and complicated

4101.6 --> 4104.88
but it is

4102.719 --> 4106.799
in my opinion suitable even for like

4104.88 --> 4108.96
little kids

4106.799 --> 4112.799
he's very focused like that and he's

4108.96 --> 4112.799
just a smooth pleasant guy

4116.839 --> 4120.64
so

4118.799 --> 4123.679
and and he really does stick to flat

4120.64 --> 4123.679
earth most of the time

4124.719 --> 4129.199
so what he's been doing is basically

4126.4 --> 4131.679
taking the main arguments and then

4129.199 --> 4134.799
making it that

4131.679 --> 4138.08
the subject of today's class right

4134.799 --> 4138.08
that's how he kind of does it

4140.159 --> 4147.199
it's especially suitable for newcomers

4144.64 --> 4149.04
i mean for me personally

4147.199 --> 4150.48
it gets a little boring but that's

4149.04 --> 4152.96
because yeah

4150.48 --> 4154.48
i've been at it every day for five years

4152.96 --> 4156.319
so it's like not

4154.48 --> 4157.12
i'm i'm not really gonna hear anything

4156.319 --> 4158.2390000000005
new

4157.12 --> 4160.4
see

4158.239 --> 4162.879999999999
i think that might be a contribution

4160.4 --> 4165.3589999999995
to why i'm not really there all the time

4162.88 --> 4165.359
in chat

4165.759 --> 4172.799
because it is like a school and it is

4168.56 --> 4172.799
especially suitable for newcomers

4173.359 --> 4179.359
but it's a great effort and he has

4175.839 --> 4180.96
brilliant visuals like good

4179.359 --> 4183.92
presentations

4180.96 --> 4186.88
with visuals he shows like in the live

4183.92 --> 4188.719
stream and just that amazing

4186.88 --> 4191.12

4191.12 --> 4197.84

4194.88 --> 4199.28
forests it's just amazing overall i

4197.84 --> 4203.84

4199.28 --> 4203.84
every part of his work

4203.92 --> 4209.36

4207.199 --> 4213.799999999999
