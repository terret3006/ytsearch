interesting thank you for doing that I'm

233.29 --> 241.0
glad somebody is doing that because it

238.06 --> 244.06
is kind of scary for me too you know

241.0 --> 245.65
it's like dear life I got I had a good

244.06 --> 247.75
feeling about that but still I haven't

249.57 --> 254.65

great work flat earth needs more

268.57 --> 273.34
down-to-earth people like you oh thank

270.82 --> 275.8
you well to be fair I don't think I'm

273.34 --> 280.03
that down-to-earth really but I do my

275.8 --> 281.77000000000004
best thank you or yeah in a way I'm very

280.03 --> 285.60999999999996
down-to-earth and in other ways I'm not

281.77 --> 285.96999999999997
very down-to-earth but again I do my

285.61 --> 289.62
best

285.97 --> 289.62
Thank You Man much appreciated

291.11 --> 294.41
[Music]

294.659 --> 300.21999999999997
but yeah in general the earth the world

298.03 --> 302.25899999999996
the realm definitely does need a lot

300.22 --> 307.509
more down-to-earth people that don't get

302.259 --> 315.75
caught up in the in the storm in fear

307.509 --> 319.93
porn in panic in mind-control theatrics

315.75 --> 322.449
just look and see what it is and and

319.93 --> 326.05
test what it is to see whether it is

322.449 --> 328.21000000000004
really real or not and it's very scary

326.05 --> 334.389
in a way because you feel like you risk

328.21 --> 336.219
a lot what happens but if you're just

334.389 --> 338.199
careful if you just take good control

336.219 --> 340.81
for your own impulses in those moments

338.199 --> 343.659
and they have perfect calm like real

340.81 --> 345.55
genuine calm and you also like the

343.659 --> 348.58
people that often are a part of the

345.55 --> 352.719
spell they don't know it so if you just

348.58 --> 356.229
don't radiate radiates hostility or

352.719 --> 358.419
anguish or agitation concerning them and

356.229 --> 363.669
rather try to see it like yeah they're

358.419 --> 366.639
afraid to then it may turn out to work a

363.669 --> 372.31
lot better even if you don't get any

366.639 --> 374.49
conclusive data anyway just very over

372.31 --> 382.18
general sorry about that

374.49 --> 386.37
hmm very over generalize but it does

382.18 --> 389.08
kind of work like a little empathy in

386.37 --> 391.75
difficult situations can do a lot of

389.08 --> 395.289
miracles but it does take energy

391.75 --> 397.479
you can't just slack it off because then

395.289 --> 400.589
this is gonna go wrong you're gonna just

397.479 --> 403.029
get into a fire so I'm gonna run anyway

400.589 --> 405.31
and that concerns all kinds of thing not

403.029 --> 409.0
just like the globe versus Flat Earth

405.31 --> 411.219
even the political narratives for

409.0 --> 412.779
example and the oppositional parties and

411.219 --> 415.96
like what is really going on is it

412.779 --> 418.629
really exactly like your group is saying

415.96 --> 420.4
well probably not is it exactly like

418.629 --> 422.649
what the opposite group is saying well

420.4 --> 425.979
probably not so let's look at both

422.649 --> 426.46
things and see what of it is kind of

425.979 --> 428.38
true

426.46 --> 431.63899999999995
from what perspective and what is

428.38 --> 436.03
definitely not true and then put

431.639 --> 439.33
separate the straw man from the actual

436.03 --> 441.94
it's very difficult because you're

439.33 --> 445.35999999999996
getting pretty much two pictures and

441.94 --> 448.599
it's like both groups give two pictures

445.36 --> 451.0
one gives a little tries to cover up

448.599 --> 452.38
certain things ignore it makes it things

451.0 --> 454.78
seem better the other one is going to

452.38 --> 456.849
emphasize that even though they're gonna

454.78 --> 461.169
probably take it out of context this

456.849 --> 464.169
works both for well the the alternative

461.169 --> 466.9
right trumpian movements trying to

464.169 --> 470.19899999999996
supposedly do the good thing and in ways

466.9 --> 474.48999999999995
are in other ways are kind of being bit

470.199 --> 476.41
ignorant and the other party trying to

474.49 --> 478.69
be sensible but at the same time

476.41 --> 482.8
basically letting everything go too much

478.69 --> 486.34
and therefore yeah getting dissonant and

482.8 --> 490.3
psychotic and like put pulling people

486.34 --> 492.28
way too far it's like not a constructive

490.3 --> 494.08
it's not gonna lead to a constructive

492.28 --> 496.17999999999995
end result it's just impossible and

494.08 --> 500.10999999999996
anybody that imagines this is out of

496.18 --> 503.8
their mind it's not the way to go no

500.11 --> 509.34000000000003
matter what you view of what should be

503.8 --> 509.34000000000003
allowed or not it's crazy all of it is

510.03 --> 520.5989999999999
anyway that that's my view in it but the

518.919 --> 523.2289999999999
funny thing is is that all groups

520.599 --> 526.3900000000001
usually have some good points somewhere

523.229 --> 528.13
but yeah in moments and especially if

526.39 --> 531.73
they're very very politicized it's just

528.13 --> 537.1
all going to be litter on top of a giant

531.73 --> 541.32
pile of politicized image to try to

537.1 --> 541.32
manipulate people's mindsets so

545.76 --> 548.95
yeah

546.94 --> 553.1400000000001
welcome back Tom Parker you're on

548.95 --> 553.1400000000001
probation just so you know and you do

556.62 --> 562.35
and I link my youtube channel to library

567.3 --> 572.89
back up your YouTube channel are you

570.55 --> 576.42
serious I don't think they're gonna back

572.89 --> 576.42
up my entire channel like that

583.59 --> 588.96
but look I'll look into it I I am

586.71 --> 599.52
considering indeed like making an

588.96 --> 601.1700000000001
account but yeah it's look if anything

599.52 --> 603.93
if I'm gonna do anything else with

601.17 --> 607.14
besides YouTube then I'm considering D

603.93 --> 609.42
life and I'm just I'm more trying to

607.14 --> 612.63
prepare fighter right moment of a new

609.42 --> 615.8389999999999
thing or some kind of transition moment

612.63 --> 617.73
where I can try that out and to really

615.839 --> 619.9200000000001
branch out on all these other things I

617.73 --> 621.99
don't know man I think I will lose track

619.92 --> 625.62
how completely lose track of everything

621.99 --> 628.8
I do it's kind of the reason I didn't

625.62 --> 640.14
really want to even go to Twitter and

628.8 --> 644.0889999999999
all that dank 5g causes Corona fires

640.14 --> 647.4
it's your new hunch yeah it I heard it

644.089 --> 651.45
well now it's up to everyone to point

647.4 --> 654.9599999999999
out the correlations the funny thing is

651.45 --> 658.2900000000001
I actually put that up in chat over at

654.96 --> 660.9300000000001
lift of Hill who talked about if

658.29 --> 661.9499999999999
coronavirus again he does it a lot I I

660.93 --> 665.4899999999999
didn't know man

661.95 --> 667.9200000000001
I think he has some people that are

665.49 --> 671.79
really trying to feed it to him as it

667.92 --> 676.02
were and I think he's he's probably he

671.79 --> 679.5889999999999
is probably a bit of a Honeycutt

676.02 --> 682.35
germaphobe or what used to be and that

679.589 --> 688.1
probably because of that it all gets to

682.35 --> 690.36
him so I think he's pretty genuine but

688.1 --> 692.5500000000001
yeah he also brought forth the

690.36 --> 700.17
Democratic debates again and man it's

692.55 --> 702.99
continuing and it's just I'm fascinated

700.17 --> 707.43
to watch it but not for the reason that

702.99 --> 709.47
that is it's supposed to function as I'm

707.43 --> 713.1099999999999
just fascinating by seeing all these

709.47 --> 717.53
people do their things like

713.11 --> 719.96
what a crazy show it is in so many ways

717.53 --> 722.74
so many it is really fits like an

719.96 --> 727.1
aberration on its own it's amazing but

722.74 --> 730.01
it is all like I even said it in the

727.1 --> 733.19
chats during lift to fill the show lift

730.01 --> 735.98
the veil show as it was going like yeah

733.19 --> 738.25
they're saying all these dreams like we

735.98 --> 740.69
have to do this we have to do that or

738.25 --> 742.28
all of them were doing it one way or the

740.69 --> 744.98
other and they were really doing their

742.28 --> 749.51
best to put down a really good dream as

744.98 --> 752.15
it were but overlooking every single

749.51 --> 754.91
time that they have mapped like if

752.15 --> 758.63
anyone out there in politics has

754.91 --> 762.11
absolutely no control over these types

758.63 --> 764.18
of things it's the Democrats and they

762.11 --> 768.98
kind of overlook telling everyone that

764.18 --> 773.7199999999999
it's just a dream with them it is just a

768.98 --> 775.99
dream absolutely because soon as they

773.72 --> 778.4300000000001
win they have absolutely no say you know

775.99 --> 782.3
they'll be happy if they're you have

778.43 --> 784.64
some some side projects left to at least

782.3 --> 786.8299999999999
least make it look on the surface like

784.64 --> 788.93
band-aid service to their concepts

786.83 --> 790.76
that's the most I'll get out of it

788.93 --> 794.42
because they're completely bound by the

790.76 --> 799.13
party line and the investments you know

794.42 --> 801.53
it's so unattended is really what came

799.13 --> 804.02
over me as I noticed that they were all

801.53 --> 811.52
really just painting these incredible

804.02 --> 815.51
pictures and in their own ways and it's

811.52 --> 818.06
almost like damn I really wish they they

815.51 --> 822.74
would and could do that but you know

818.06 --> 829.15
they won't it was over sad that's why

822.74 --> 833.02
it's it was quite surreal to see it and

829.15 --> 833.02
I'm curious where it'll go

833.08 --> 840.6500000000001
and all of them are such characters man

836.06 --> 844.8
there's such characters but not as in

840.65 --> 849.029
they have character but in they're such

844.8 --> 850.62
just their own persona and the things

849.029 --> 858.51
that they typically do in their

850.62 --> 860.97
goofiness is and yeah right anyway I'll

858.51 --> 862.3389999999999
stop boring you all with that probably

860.97 --> 864.45
most of you don't even watch that

862.339 --> 868.19
although there are some really odd

864.45 --> 871.38
remarks in there too like did you hear

868.19 --> 878.2790000000001
Biden made another unique comment he

871.38 --> 885.06
said what is it I have more hair than I

878.279 --> 887.1
think I do or no wait the other way

885.06 --> 896.959
around I have less hair that I think it

887.1 --> 896.9590000000001
was so weird anyway stop war you know

911.41 --> 914.41
okay

928.3 --> 933.38
- Thunder and you're not really welcome

931.67 --> 938.87
back you can say that you're on

933.38 --> 941.35
probation but anyway we'll see what

938.87 --> 941.35
you're doing

943.33 --> 950.8000000000001
now now it's not ridiculous Paul Roberts

947.11 --> 954.8000000000001
coronavirus is literally a common cold

950.8 --> 957.56
symptom I don't even think that the

954.8 --> 962.3599999999999
common cold that it is like a virus that

957.56 --> 965.9799999999999
it is an infectious disease like

962.36 --> 968.839
bacterial infection is very provably

965.98 --> 971.27
yeah you can scientifically kind of

968.839 --> 975.5600000000001
prove that it that that definitely has a

971.27 --> 977.96
direct effect although again it is all

975.56 --> 980.3299999999999
about the general condition of the body

977.96 --> 983.48
if the body is great if morale is

980.33 --> 986.63
fantastic then it's amazing how well it

983.48 --> 990.71
can heal and what it can take concerning

986.63 --> 995.36
outside pathogens really and bacteria is

990.71 --> 997.48
pretty much yeah we have so many

995.36 --> 1001.9
different bacteria going through us

997.48 --> 1006.21
being assimilated being there's so much

1001.9 --> 1012.31
happening in the micro world of the Y at

1006.21 --> 1015.0400000000001
the cellular level as it were it's a I

1012.31 --> 1018.7299999999999
really see it like a giant city or

1015.04 --> 1022.5
rather more like an entire country that

1018.73 --> 1022.5
depth and it's incredible it works

1027.56 --> 1030.6599999999999
[Music]

1035.87 --> 1047.4189999999999
yeah whatever Ivan I'd trust you anymore

1042.39 --> 1053.64
I think your your shilling for something

1047.419 --> 1058.7700000000002
whatever hmm more bacteria than cells in

1053.64 --> 1062.3700000000001
the body right it's well just just what

1058.77 --> 1065.57
we're learning about the guts and the

1062.37 --> 1071.549
fluoride in the guts yes that is

1065.57 --> 1075.09
literally blowing biologists mind and

1071.549 --> 1078.6
it's like a big new project to it it's

1075.09 --> 1082.34
look bacteria the bacterial theory was

1078.6 --> 1085.5
even kind of superficial and viruses is

1082.34 --> 1087.75
too far I think it is just conceptual I

1085.5 --> 1090.0
because there's so so many weird a

1087.75 --> 1092.64
little aberrations that have been left

1090.0 --> 1098.669
out of the loop concerning viruses one

1092.64 --> 1102.21
being that yeah it seems to be viruses

1098.669 --> 1107.179
are literally can be like created by the

1102.21 --> 1109.2
body spun out of nothing and so

1107.179 --> 1112.2900000000002
theoretically and I think that's even

1109.2 --> 1114.57
been tested I can't give you any

1112.29 --> 1116.46
references so it's basically fat wet

1114.57 --> 1118.32
finger work at this point that's why I

1116.46 --> 1119.76
want more people that have more

1118.32 --> 1123.29
knowledge about this and I know they're

1119.76 --> 1125.58
out there I want to talk with them and

1123.29 --> 1127.559
since there are some people out there

1125.58 --> 1129.84
that do know German new medicine they

1127.559 --> 1131.52
must have heard of this too and they

1129.84 --> 1133.6499999999999
must know something about it I have not

1131.52 --> 1138.57
read many books I this is all word of

1133.65 --> 1141.3600000000001
mouth for me so but based on people that

1138.57 --> 1144.48
I do definitely trust to certain degrees

1141.36 --> 1146.75
that are high enough for it to keep it

1144.48 --> 1147.929
around in my butt in the back of my mind

1146.75 --> 1149.79
hmm

1147.929 --> 1151.47
even though I didn't understand

1149.79 --> 1153.27
everything at the time you could feel it

1151.47 --> 1158.88
there was something right about it

1153.27 --> 1163.76
so viruses can potentially spawn even if

1158.88 --> 1167.4
there is a perfect barrier in between

1163.76 --> 1168.41
that the substance cannot physically

1167.4 --> 1172.64
pass

1168.41 --> 1174.8600000000001
and there's never been any contact can

1172.64 --> 1180.0500000000002
just fun and my theory about that is

1174.86 --> 1183.05
that it has to do with resonance I that

1180.05 --> 1186.71
it's almost like the body through

1183.05 --> 1188.96
resonance in some way it could be on a

1186.71 --> 1191.8400000000001
physiological level energy level

1188.96 --> 1197.33
inspired to kind of spawn it as a

1191.84 --> 1200.8
response to a situation because I think

1197.33 --> 1206.57
that those virus may be for example

1200.8 --> 1211.06
preliminary workers some process that is

1206.57 --> 1214.8799999999999
part of the metabolic health overhaul

1211.06 --> 1218.24
get the say the flu process and that is

1214.88 --> 1222.23
just a site spawn effect it's not really

1218.24 --> 1225.8
an infectious thing although technically

1222.23 --> 1228.38
you can if you get overwhelmed by these

1225.8 --> 1232.22
types of substances because I guess they

1228.38 --> 1234.38
can spawn under conditions but it's just

1232.22 --> 1238.01
unclear where whether it is purely

1234.38 --> 1240.0800000000002
psychosomatic or not because some people

1238.01 --> 1242.69
and and they have of course the carrier

1240.08 --> 1246.9199999999998
idea as well well that's just some

1242.69 --> 1249.74
people that can just resist it they can

1246.92 --> 1252.65
just resist it and there's no real

1249.74 --> 1254.78
explanation because it is approached

1252.65 --> 1259.3700000000001
from the angle that it is an infectious

1254.78 --> 1261.83
disease see it's like a cognitive

1259.37 --> 1264.4099999999999
dissonance thing happening because of

1261.83 --> 1266.81
the base assumption of how it all works

1264.41 --> 1269.5700000000002
and all the medical workers and all that

1266.81 --> 1272.21
they believe it they do see the things

1269.57 --> 1275.12
the data points on which the theory

1272.21 --> 1276.98
rests in their experimentation and their

1275.12 --> 1280.1299999999999
microscopes and all that they do see

1276.98 --> 1282.95
these things happening but they're

1280.13 --> 1285.5300000000002
overlooking that it is kind of a

1282.95 --> 1291.17
preliminary approach and a lot of it is

1285.53 --> 1296.11
is not as conclusive as should be to to

1291.17 --> 1296.1100000000001
make it that definitive in its workings

1296.25 --> 1304.929
yeah and people died from the flu

1300.78 --> 1308.22
happens G yeah sometimes it's just too

1304.929 --> 1308.22
weak you can take the process

1312.24 --> 1317.119
[Music]

1317.35 --> 1323.48
now it's not coming from nothing Paul

1320.78 --> 1326.27
Roberts don't twist my words don't quote

1323.48 --> 1329.8700000000001
mine me thank you very much what I'm

1326.27 --> 1333.43
saying is that it is part of a metabolic

1329.87 --> 1336.6499999999999
system as it's part of the the

1333.43 --> 1340.0700000000002
microorganisms and it can just be

1336.65 --> 1344.8400000000001
spawned within the body as a natural

1340.07 --> 1347.99
function and maybe the blueprint can be

1344.84 --> 1350.51
so exactly the same because of a

1347.99 --> 1353.9
resonation because of an an energy-based

1350.51 --> 1357.68
resonation thing which absolutely sure

1353.9 --> 1362.0800000000002
it is part of just life itself with many

1357.68 --> 1367.94
things in many ways resonance frequency

1362.08 --> 1371.75
and so I think that it doesn't literally

1367.94 --> 1375.67
manifest like the blueprint of it itself

1371.75 --> 1378.41
manifests out of nothing no it's like

1375.67 --> 1383.3600000000001
the information of its type may be

1378.41 --> 1385.64
copied and then it started up as part of

1383.36 --> 1392.02
the psychosomatic triggered startup

1385.64 --> 1397.76
process as it's just look I'm basically

1392.02 --> 1400.61
it's very tough for me it's very tough

1397.76 --> 1403.97
for me to even try to figure out how to

1400.61 --> 1407.27
approach it because there's a lot of

1403.97 --> 1410.72
things that I don't fully understand

1407.27 --> 1414.02
about how the microbiome works with

1410.72 --> 1418.39
these things Oh Chet Chet is stuck

1414.02 --> 1418.3899999999999
thanks for reminding me here Andy

1419.39 --> 1422.14
that's the wrong button

1426.18 --> 1442.4
yeah thanks maybe a byproduct of the RNA

1444.32 --> 1451.53
well you're starting to think from the

1448.92 --> 1453.21
right angle in my personal view that's

1451.53 --> 1455.46
kind of what I it's like all these

1453.21 --> 1458.3700000000001
things that have been identified and

1455.46 --> 1464.88
tested and like the mechanism of it it

1458.37 --> 1468.9899999999998
just almost seems to me as if a super

1464.88 --> 1470.8200000000002
super giant Titan a figure larger than

1468.99 --> 1472.92
the world itself now this is purely

1470.82 --> 1476.8799999999999
hypothetical just for the scales of it

1472.92 --> 1479.27
is looking at the surface for example of

1476.88 --> 1482.46
Europe or America with a looking-glass

1479.27 --> 1484.62
right seeing like wow look at these

1482.46 --> 1487.65
these type of buildings these type of

1484.62 --> 1491.4599999999998
buildings keep reoccurring they keep

1487.65 --> 1492.69
spawning look there's another one oh it

1491.46 --> 1494.46
seems there's another field where

1492.69 --> 1497.64
they're spawning and what's going on oh

1494.46 --> 1501.21
there's more human activity I see the

1497.64 --> 1504.42
little ones going around that is almost

1501.21 --> 1506.88
what it feels like to me it's like yeah

1504.42 --> 1510.0
you think you got it right with that

1506.88 --> 1514.5300000000002
model well it'll probably be so much

1510.0 --> 1520.8
more mind-boggling Lee fractal complex

1514.53 --> 1524.46
that we just we just got a puff of off

1520.8 --> 1527.21
the whole thing that's kind of my

1524.46 --> 1527.21
suspicion

1532.1 --> 1535.1
yeah

1535.67 --> 1542.0990000000002
[Music]

1543.4 --> 1548.8300000000002
I was always extremely fascinated by

1546.88 --> 1553.5100000000002
just looking at microscopes and what

1548.83 --> 1556.48
goes on and I've also even tried to

1553.51 --> 1559.24
experiment like with my mind deal with

1556.48 --> 1563.59
it like could I for potentially for

1559.24 --> 1566.65
example have my piece of my blood under

1563.59 --> 1569.1999999999998
a microscope look at it and then focus

1566.65 --> 1571.93
really hard on certain types of emotions

1569.2 --> 1575.26
for example and see if it would respond

1571.93 --> 1578.17
differently unfortunately I did not have

1575.26 --> 1579.76
the time to or the patient it was just

1578.17 --> 1585.72
an idea mostly what I didn't even have

1579.76 --> 1585.72
the patience to sit to sit through it

1589.14 --> 1594.6000000000001
but I do think that like every piece of

1591.91 --> 1597.16
our body every cell has a direct

1594.6 --> 1600.76
connection also to the conscious

1597.16 --> 1603.4
experience and it is kind of in line I

1600.76 --> 1608.5
think that sometimes like every cell is

1603.4 --> 1611.8300000000002
kind of conscious of what you are in a

1608.5 --> 1613.9
way oh I got a super jet oh I missed

1611.83 --> 1615.9099999999999
that huh too chatty

1613.9 --> 1618.76
yeah and indeed Thank You Amanda young

1615.91 --> 1621.13
for the $10.00 super jet donation 24/7

1618.76 --> 1626.71
stream with an illuminati christening

1621.13 --> 1629.23
Gritti my favorite flavors yeah the 24/7

1626.71 --> 1632.26
streamer I probably joined that at some

1629.23 --> 1635.19
point again I thought it was an

1632.26 --> 1635.19
interesting experience

1640.43 --> 1649.5800000000002
- thanks again Amanda young the Japanese

1645.02 --> 1653.6
guy with water yeah dr. Emoto indeed it

1649.58 --> 1656.51
was so very very stuffy Sciuto changes

1653.6 --> 1660.1
he's your shooter scientists it's like

1656.51 --> 1660.1
you look who's talking everybody else

1660.34 --> 1669.53
yeah but I'm pretty damn sure he did

1666.83 --> 1672.62
very manipulate the independent area

1669.53 --> 1676.16
love his concept even though it's yeah

1672.62 --> 1679.1299999999999
it's not physical it is information it

1676.16 --> 1685.22
is the conscious response but yeah it

1679.13 --> 1689.18
did kind of very manipulate it so I

1685.22 --> 1692.24
don't know but yeah dr. Emoto very

1689.18 --> 1694.16
fascinating is one of the first how

1692.24 --> 1697.93
glimmers of hope for me personally that

1694.16 --> 1704.0
there is just so much more to the to

1697.93 --> 1705.74
being a being a man and then just being

1704.0 --> 1710.15
a hump of flesh and your consciousness

1705.74 --> 1712.25
is this miraculous or unique side effect

1710.15 --> 1714.2900000000002
of just how your brain is constructed or

1712.25 --> 1717.79
something he was the first one that

1714.29 --> 1721.94
really started to show like wow what you

1717.79 --> 1724.8799999999999
feel and your very presence has an

1721.94 --> 1728.8400000000001
influence measurably I thought that was

1724.88 --> 1732.3100000000002
extremely fascinating extremely

1728.84 --> 1735.53
fascinating and also just showing a

1732.31 --> 1739.73
deeper miraculous quality of water in

1735.53 --> 1744.56
general which we consist of a lot so we

1739.73 --> 1750.2
have that water effect that water power

1744.56 --> 1754.37
also within us henceforth probably in a

1750.2 --> 1760.31
way could even be correlation wise tied

1754.37 --> 1763.31
in with psychosomatic or thought about

1760.31 --> 1764.57
that never thought about that that

1763.31 --> 1767.6
psycho cymatics

1764.57 --> 1770.05
and the water in our body may have a

1767.6 --> 1770.05
connection

1770.27 --> 1775.03

[Music]

1819.2 --> 1822.349
[Music]

1823.2 --> 1835.38
yeah Tom Parker look you're just by

1827.669 --> 1835.8600000000001
saying right but I see what you did

1835.38 --> 1840.6000000000001
there

1835.86 --> 1846.299
Oh Oh wrap all Roberts Tom Parker

1840.6 --> 1852.84
tricked you I think you're oh that was a

1846.299 --> 1855.69
cleverly put it it's not he's not saying

1852.84 --> 1857.85
that he takes his faith over facts that

1855.69 --> 1863.69
he said he is saying his take taking his

1857.85 --> 1867.1499999999999
faith over your facts you probably

1863.69 --> 1869.6100000000001
didn't see the distinguishment because

1867.15 --> 1873.0
you think your effects are defects and

1869.61 --> 1878.6999999999998
that's kind of part of the the twist

1873.0 --> 1880.559
that was very smart very smart I didn't

1878.7 --> 1883.19
even catch it at first it took me a few

1880.559 --> 1883.19
seconds

1909.38 --> 1918.009
oh really which one's Paul Roberts which

1915.409 --> 1921.1100000000001
of your facts are science-based and very

1918.009 --> 1924.049
verifiable I hope you mean verifiable

1921.11 --> 1929.83
through scientific experimentation using

1924.049 --> 1932.95
a valid hypothesis or you just mean the

1929.83 --> 1935.299
culture of science point and declare

1932.95 --> 1941.74
correlation as long as it abides by the

1935.299 --> 1941.74
preponderance of that the works

1959.879 --> 1972.1899999999998
evolution oh my god yeah this man has

1968.799 --> 1984.34
scientific valid evidence that the earth

1972.19 --> 1990.989
is a ball thank you for that thank you

1984.34 --> 1990.9889999999998
ah that's just great

2006.56 --> 2013.95
bring it on em yeah we'll sift through

2010.23 --> 2016.74
all of that once again or as much as you

2013.95 --> 2020.07
can muster no points at every little

2016.74 --> 2022.44
detail how it's all just weird arbitrary

2020.07 --> 2030.32
correlation speculation based in one way

2022.44 --> 2033.8700000000001
or the other and so much just fabricated

2030.32 --> 2037.1399999999999
dinosaur nonsense evolution proof

2033.87 --> 2039.2399999999998
there's no real evolution proof it's

2037.14 --> 2041.7900000000002
even admitted they're still looking for

2039.24 --> 2045.03
their it's like it's kind of like their

2041.79 --> 2049.29
own stances like yeah there's some weak

2045.03 --> 2051.63
proofs especially in the past but we're

2049.29 --> 2062.82
onto something we gotta find it that's

2051.63 --> 2068.28
really the reality of it but maybe one

2062.82 --> 2071.4900000000002
day you figure out how to spawn some

2068.28 --> 2073.65
kind of life-form and then figure out

2071.49 --> 2075.93
like yeah we shouldn't have done that I

2073.65 --> 2085.02
don't know man I don't know what that

2075.93 --> 2087.24
freakin belief is gonna lead to yeah as

2085.02 --> 2089.7
far as all the data that I've seen all

2087.24 --> 2092.33
the and when I talk data I don't talk

2089.7 --> 2095.3999999999996
about talking points I'm talking about

2092.33 --> 2097.5
people have actually be better have

2095.4 --> 2099.3
actually like stared into freaking

2097.5 --> 2102.83
microscopes and thought about it and

2099.3 --> 2107.3
like report on what they say they see

2102.83 --> 2110.79
that type of data all of that and

2107.3 --> 2114.42
studies of animals and like and group

2110.79 --> 2116.42
behavior and I have all of it it's it

2114.42 --> 2121.76
doesn't work man

2116.42 --> 2129.0
it's mutation does happen but it happens

2121.76 --> 2131.61
quickly and then it either restores this

2129.0 --> 2134.07
because yeah it's like before for

2131.61 --> 2136.86
example in a certain group of animals

2134.07 --> 2138.78
that are together they certainly drink

2136.86 --> 2143.29
from some kind of

2138.78 --> 2145.5400000000004
and no new contaminant in water that

2143.29 --> 2146.83
they can't even taste and then they all

2145.54 --> 2149.41
get kind of poison

2146.83 --> 2151.5699999999997
they don't really die from it but they

2149.41 --> 2154.69
get a certain burden and that leads to

2151.57 --> 2157.3300000000004
like this weird effect where in all

2154.69 --> 2159.4
their offspring there is this odd

2157.33 --> 2162.1
mutation while this odd mutation can

2159.4 --> 2164.5
then literally kill the next generation

2162.1 --> 2168.31
or they can live with it and then it'll

2164.5 --> 2174.46
go away again because it resort back to

2168.31 --> 2176.79
the original blueprints with adaptations

2174.46 --> 2179.02
based on the surroundings and the

2176.79 --> 2183.93
preponderance of the the past the

2179.02 --> 2188.859
genetic records were like the the actual

2183.93 --> 2191.08
memory of like the memory of just what

2188.859 --> 2194.44
has happened the ancestral memory they

2191.08 --> 2198.2799999999997
call it that's much more determining so

2194.44 --> 2203.44
it just goes away again it does not stay

2198.28 --> 2205.2000000000003
these mutations don't stay forever it

2203.44 --> 2212.08
just doesn't happen

2205.2 --> 2216.22
there's no way yeah because animals know

2212.08 --> 2220.93
when something is a mutation and in

2216.22 --> 2224.3199999999997
general they pick the non-mutated over

2220.93 --> 2226.4199999999996
the mutated guess why that is maybe has

2224.32 --> 2231.19
something to do with ancestral memory as

2226.42 --> 2233.369
well but not saying that all this is not

2231.19 --> 2235.51
some kind of attack I'm like the

2233.369 --> 2238.56
handicapped or anything you know but it

2235.51 --> 2240.4900000000002
is it is more about the evolution itself

2238.56 --> 2243.31
you know because the mind

2240.49 --> 2245.31
I believe in mind evolution I believe in

2243.31 --> 2250.35
the evolution of the consciousness but

2245.31 --> 2250.35
not not the physical body

2252.239 --> 2262.349
I think that's a misunderstanding but

2258.779 --> 2264.239
just this design blueprint and it's even

2262.349 --> 2267.869
said that it kind of degrades over time

2264.239 --> 2270.539
because of mutagenic influences but if

2267.869 --> 2275.819
those mutagenic influences eventually go

2270.539 --> 2277.739
away then we'll see what's left and how

2275.819 --> 2279.719
much it can be restored back to how

2277.739 --> 2282.479
should be and how pure that can get

2279.719 --> 2285.839
maybe it can even sort of refer back we

2282.479 --> 2288.209
don't know because we're already so

2285.839 --> 2297.209
unnatural as it were from the original

2288.209 --> 2299.759
way of living but yeah there's just a

2297.209 --> 2302.5789999999997
standard design blueprint with which it

2299.759 --> 2304.859
started which is like part of the entire

2302.579 --> 2308.4190000000003
design the design of creation itself

2304.859 --> 2313.049
it's just part of how it works

2308.419 --> 2316.769
now how yeah how all of it just works

2313.049 --> 2320.009
how life works and if yeah if there's

2316.769 --> 2322.9489999999996
just too many alterations then it

2320.009 --> 2325.799
becomes unviable it either if something

2322.949 --> 2333.4790000000003
mutates especially too quickly or too

2325.799 --> 2335.459
far it either dies out or it starts to

2333.479 --> 2340.019
become like really aggressive and can't

2335.459 --> 2342.3889999999997
procreate anymore that's kind of sort of

2340.019 --> 2344.549
the standard what happens when you go

2342.389 --> 2348.119
too far outside of the original

2344.549 --> 2351.479
blueprint with the species but it's ya

2348.119 --> 2354.199
have to get very extreme even to

2351.479 --> 2360.3889999999997
accomplish that in ways but that's

2354.199 --> 2363.419
flukes still happen but I don't know

2360.389 --> 2365.9990000000003
it's just the idea of evolution of this

2363.419 --> 2369.089
migration of what is the stuff what did

2365.999 --> 2370.769
what the species is and then mutates in

2369.089 --> 2373.529
a direction and then certainly it's like

2370.769 --> 2377.3289999999997
think now this is the standard around

2373.529 --> 2379.889
which the whole regress progress

2377.329 --> 2383.429
adaptation works I don't think so

2379.889 --> 2385.639
I absolutely see no evidence of that

2383.429 --> 2385.639
whatsoever

2385.66 --> 2391.5989999999997
while we do know that it does happen

2388.2 --> 2393.3689999999997
with the species we know or are there

2391.599 --> 2396.19
and what he's learned from the genome

2393.369 --> 2399.73
project and everything adaptation so

2396.19 --> 2403.03
that's just very little left of the

2399.73 --> 2406.26
evolution theory in hires up know what

2403.03 --> 2406.26
they know it

2415.29 --> 2424.46
[Music]

2418.06 --> 2431.18
magic magic is just a word something you

2424.46 --> 2445.76
don't understand that's really when it

2431.18 --> 2447.68
come down and comes down to or even

2445.76 --> 2448.61
differently like if something is

2447.68 --> 2451.58
happening

2448.61 --> 2455.4100000000003
you don't understand how then the mind

2451.58 --> 2459.89
will be very frustrated and try to force

2455.41 --> 2463.94
give an explanation for something that

2459.89 --> 2466.73
was changed and then it can get puzzled

2463.94 --> 2469.79
and think this is magic this can be I

2466.73 --> 2473.93
don't get it that's see see so it's

2469.79 --> 2475.94
literally not understanding because if

2473.93 --> 2480.0499999999997
you see everything there's really not

2475.94 --> 2483.38
that much magic left except for just how

2480.05 --> 2485.3900000000003
freaking magical reality really is but

2483.38 --> 2492.35
that's not the same thing

2485.39 --> 2496.46
oh really miss quoting evolution ah I'm

2492.35 --> 2503.68
so sorry I'm so sorry I didn't say is

2496.46 --> 2508.16
right I'm pretty sure look I didn't even

2503.68 --> 2511.94
did I did I even say exactly how if

2508.16 --> 2515.0299999999997
evolution is set to work well I'm pretty

2511.94 --> 2518.78
sure the idea is literally of a genome

2515.03 --> 2524.6000000000004
group mutating changing into another

2518.78 --> 2527.15
that is the evolution theory if I'm not

2524.6 --> 2529.8199999999997
mistaking sorry if I didn't put it down

2527.15 --> 2533.44
exactly right tiny wubble I know your

2529.82 --> 2533.44
belief is very precious to you

2539.83 --> 2546.25
what how how professor bill how is these

2544.48 --> 2548.32
very getting stronger with your

2546.25 --> 2553.78
understanding of peptides proteins and

2548.32 --> 2555.19
RNA how how exactly you tell me come on

2553.78 --> 2562.51
I want to hear it

2555.19 --> 2568.23
this is hilarious come on tell me how

2562.51 --> 2568.23
does one gene group over time change

2568.32 --> 2576.94
mutate become something pretty much

2572.41 --> 2582.0699999999997
different so fastly that it transits

2576.94 --> 2585.15
into a whole new design blueprint tell

2582.07 --> 2587.6200000000003
me how the the yeah the micro organelles

2585.15 --> 2591.31
that you pretty much summarized there

2587.62 --> 2595.08
how do they prove that professor Phil

2591.31 --> 2595.08
well I'm curious now

2618.319 --> 2620.349
ah

2626.85 --> 2633.49
right it did feel a little bit just like

2630.07 --> 2637.17
a rumpus assertion like oh this is the

2633.49 --> 2640.1189999999997
proves it rather well he's not actually

2637.17 --> 2643.9
he it kind of like made it up and it

2640.119 --> 2646.15
like he probably believes there could be

2643.9 --> 2656.53
a correlation but he doesn't actually

2646.15 --> 2660.28
really know it I think yeah I professor

2656.53 --> 2664.75
Phil Bell yeah that's right it's called

2660.28 --> 2668.3500000000004
a simulation it's like you eat food you

2664.75 --> 2671.89
break down the food you break it up in a

2668.35 --> 2675.73
certain very easily absorbable on the

2671.89 --> 2679.75
cellular level I mean no assets among

2675.73 --> 2683.35
one another and then they get absorbed

2679.75 --> 2686.32
and then built into another type of unit

2683.35 --> 2690.52
and then into a long chain of protein

2686.32 --> 2693.03
yeah that's this micro cellular building

2690.52 --> 2696.04
mechanisms how does that prove evolution

2693.03 --> 2698.32
professor if anything it proves a

2696.04 --> 2702.0299999999997
freaking design is like you really that

2698.32 --> 2706.65
up that that incredibly elaborate chain

2702.03 --> 2712.4500000000003
that just happen to over time it just

2706.65 --> 2716.56
happen to evolve like that step by step

2712.45 --> 2718.72
by accident within the singular organism

2716.56 --> 2723.6
that carries it around and survives on

2718.72 --> 2723.6
it and it was really really

2736.78 --> 2754.3900000000003
yeah I don't see any transition even for

2744.1 --> 2757.8399999999997
example from like micro parasite sized

2754.39 --> 2759.85
creatures in the ocean for example and

2757.84 --> 2761.86
they're all over the place and there are

2759.85 --> 2764.5899999999997
like they're definitely more than set

2761.86 --> 2768.4
than bacteria the different they're

2764.59 --> 2770.9500000000003
bacteria are like plasm level life-forms

2768.4 --> 2773.5
they are part of the microbiome

2770.95 --> 2776.08
well parasites are like super super

2773.5 --> 2778.21
micro organism so yeah it must have

2776.08 --> 2781.45
started somewhere right so how does that

2778.21 --> 2785.7400000000002
little thing with already kind of a

2781.45 --> 2788.95
complex design how does that gradually

2785.74 --> 2792.16
just become bigger and bigger more

2788.95 --> 2796.45
complex more complex and just like it

2792.16 --> 2799.0299999999997
get develop centuries that are like

2796.45 --> 2801.7
suddenly absorbing light instead of just

2799.03 --> 2803.59
vibration which is the easiest on the

2801.7 --> 2807.22
lower level they have like sense hairs

2803.59 --> 2812.25
even bacteria so how do they that sense

2807.22 --> 2815.02
hair certainly change into yeah a light

2812.25 --> 2819.46
transmitting system that could certainly

2815.02 --> 2826.9
see but what how do accidents like that

2819.46 --> 2830.89
happen where I want to see a very small

2826.9 --> 2835.87
creature on the unlike a small level

2830.89 --> 2839.95
suddenly developing a higher design type

2835.87 --> 2841.5099999999998
of organ I want to see that where does

2839.95 --> 2845.77
that happen because that would be

2841.51 --> 2848.11
necessary for a micro organism to over

2845.77 --> 2856.27
millions and millions of years evolved

2848.11 --> 2858.75
to this larger function so where is it

2856.27 --> 2862.75
where are these microorganisms that

2858.75 --> 2865.39
evolve and then subtly spawn more

2862.75 --> 2869.88
complex organ type systems on the

2865.39 --> 2869.8799999999997
microscopes where is it where is it

2881.31 --> 2888.02
Oh bebop Sinclair you mean it evolve you

2887.46 --> 2892.68
mean

2888.02 --> 2898.2
adapted the a denial of the evolve today

2892.68 --> 2901.5899999999997
did they besides it's a bacteria again

2898.2 --> 2904.3799999999997
it's a plasm level it's a microorganism

2901.59 --> 2907.98
that it doesn't even work the same it's

2904.38 --> 2914.1
not as a those things are the ones that

2907.98 --> 2916.5
traffic in life that's their level it's

2914.1 --> 2920.31
not really an organism you know a

2916.5 --> 2922.74
bacteria can't really well I guess some

2920.31 --> 2925.44
bacteria can actually exist outside of

2922.74 --> 2927.8999999999996
complex organisms like the ones that

2925.44 --> 2930.29
create oil and everything but is that

2927.9 --> 2932.37
evolution or is that simply incredible

2930.29 --> 2938.94
adaptation and then they kind of get

2932.37 --> 2941.31
stuck in that it's just another way for

2938.94 --> 2947.04
the bacteria to find new feeding ground

2941.31 --> 2951.06
as it were I don't see that as evolution

2947.04 --> 2953.85
I kind of see that as adaptation but

2951.06 --> 2960.45
it's still on the bacterial level so is

2953.85 --> 2965.46
evolution even appliable on that you

2960.45 --> 2968.91
know does it prove the large sized

2965.46 --> 2974.55
organism evolution does it prove that

2968.91 --> 2977.19
again micro things in there it's already

2974.55 --> 2980.6400000000003
so complex you really think that there's

2977.19 --> 2985.59
a direct correlation to how things go on

2980.64 --> 2987.65
down there to to how the bigger

2985.59 --> 2990.2400000000002
organisms of which they are a part

2987.65 --> 2993.9
actually function it's almost like

2990.24 --> 2999.3799999999997
comparing general day-to-day life in

2993.9 --> 3002.56
some household to the official face and

2999.38 --> 3009.02
political representation of a country is

3002.56 --> 3011.41
that really the same doesn't really

3009.02 --> 3011.41
represent

3012.26 --> 3017.5200000000004
it's not enough what's other things

3015.18 --> 3021.21
other priorities it's just not the same

3017.52 --> 3022.53
thing that's it to me you know anyway

3021.21 --> 3024.09
I'm gonna round out the show with this

3022.53 --> 3027.69
otherwise it's just gonna be rambling on

3024.09 --> 3029.369
for hours and back and forth I don't

3027.69 --> 3031.59
think I'm really gonna convince people I

3029.369 --> 3037.56
already put down some challenges I got I

3031.59 --> 3039.1800000000003
did get some some ideas back maybe this

3037.56 --> 3040.89
could be the permit that could be the

3039.18 --> 3043.02
proof but I don't really think so I

3040.89 --> 3044.79
haven't still have not received any

3043.02 --> 3049.44
substantial evidence that could even

3044.79 --> 3053.31
make me doubt that evolution is not not

3049.44 --> 3055.92
a viable theory at all although I

3053.31 --> 3059.73
believe in spiritual evolution but it is

3055.92 --> 3061.619
not of the earthly anyway thanks

3059.73 --> 3063.2400000000002
everyone for coming I hope you like to

3061.619 --> 3064.8900000000003
