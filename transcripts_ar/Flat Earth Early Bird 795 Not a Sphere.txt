6.36 --> 36.7
[Music]

57.76 --> 61.839999999999996
good

58.96 --> 63.84
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

61.84 --> 66.08
number 795

63.84 --> 68.08
i'm your host arwyn and before we start

66.08 --> 70.0
the show please don't forget to share it

68.08 --> 72.15899999999999
on any platform you deem fit

70.0 --> 74.24
and if you haven't already subscribe to

72.159 --> 76.4

80.88 --> 84.08
the weekend

82.0 --> 87.2
and please also do support me through

84.08 --> 90.4
the paypal patreon the super chat

87.2 --> 90.88000000000001
uh crypto wallets and the membership

90.4 --> 95.119
system

90.88 --> 99.6
join button that'll be much appreciated

95.119 --> 104.0
right so today the weather is not

99.6 --> 104.0
great it's

104.56 --> 115.28
really rainy and damp and

108.799 --> 119.84
kind of cold out there

115.28 --> 119.84
it's not the best of weathers but oh

124.79 --> 129.84
[Music]

126.84 --> 129.84
well

140.44 --> 143.44
so

144.72 --> 148.08
right so yeah yesterday's flat earth

147.28 --> 150.72
debate was

148.08 --> 150.72
pretty good

151.12 --> 153.36
uh

155.28 --> 157.84
right

160.879 --> 164.56
it's tuesday right now

166.08 --> 171.84
but yeah good show

169.12 --> 171.84
and

173.04 --> 199.12
what did i do

185.599 --> 201.92
um see

199.12 --> 202.879
yeah i've been watching a little bit of

201.92 --> 205.35999999999999
info wars

202.879 --> 206.48
and a little bit of this and that is

205.36 --> 210.84
there any videos

206.48 --> 213.84
that i forgot to write down in my notes

210.84 --> 213.84
yesterday

215.28 --> 221.84
oh yeah flat water had an

218.799 --> 221.84
interesting upload

222.08 --> 228.799
yesterday didn't watch the whole thing

225.599 --> 228.79899999999998
but yeah it's flat water

230.08 --> 233.76000000000002
so it's good pictures in the story from

232.319 --> 240.39999999999998
bible

233.76 --> 241.599
or a book uh

240.4 --> 244.72
[Music]

241.599 --> 247.04
see right then yeah

244.72 --> 247.84
mostly been watching some south park

247.04 --> 252.64
after that

247.84 --> 252.64000000000001
and rounded out the day with lift the

252.84 --> 258.959
veil

254.319 --> 258.959
so that was my day yesterday pretty much

260.149 --> 263.249
[Music]

267.52 --> 269.84
all right

270.639 --> 274.16
so i hope to be in a better mood today

272.639 --> 278.40000000000003
at least

274.16 --> 278.40000000000003
because i was not feeling all that great

280.84 --> 285.19899999999996
yesterday

283.52 --> 288.4
still waiting for the first people to

285.199 --> 288.40000000000003
arrive in my chat

294.96 --> 298.88
all right so yeah what am i gonna talked

298.479 --> 301.59999999999997
about

298.88 --> 304.8
today still gotta figure it out i just

301.6 --> 304.8
didn't really have a plan

308.84 --> 311.84
uh

316.08 --> 321.44
i was thinking since i've recently

321.84 --> 324.96
a bit of a loss when it comes to things

323.759 --> 328.47900000000004
to talk about

324.96 --> 328.479
two hours straight right

328.72 --> 332.47900000000004
i'm willing to get guests on

333.039 --> 336.88
last time i got a guest on was of course

335.199 --> 339.44
reggie and that was

336.88 --> 341.039
that was a good show i thought with him

339.44 --> 344.08
on there

341.039 --> 346.4
and yeah i'd like to go there again

344.08 --> 347.199
and yeah see what other people have to

346.4 --> 351.67999999999995
say

347.199 --> 351.68
so i am pretty much open for guests

351.759 --> 355.68
it's gonna have to be through skype even

354.0 --> 367.84
though skype does have

355.68 --> 367.84000000000003
some weird issues with obs

372.08 --> 378.31899999999996
i should also try to tap into discord

376.16 --> 381.68
sometime

378.319 --> 384.639
try to use it

381.68 --> 395.84000000000003
to maybe even get an entire panel on

384.639 --> 395.84000000000003
that could be interesting

398.96 --> 409.84
all right oh hello agm is first in chat

421.36 --> 423.84000000000003
um

437.12 --> 440.269
[Music]

442.319 --> 451.84000000000003
right so yeah the quest

446.56 --> 451.84
to prevent dead air how do you do that

455.68 --> 458.96
well i'll just start talking about flat

458.24 --> 460.72
earth

458.96 --> 462.08
like the reasons why i think the earth

460.72 --> 464.47900000000004
is flat

462.08 --> 466.96
right it is a flat earth early virtue

464.479 --> 466.96
after all

467.36 --> 469.599
so

471.12 --> 477.12
yeah how about the lack of curvature how

474.72 --> 477.12
about that

477.52 --> 481.19899999999996
you look at the horizon turns out

479.87 --> 485.44
[Music]

481.199 --> 488.639
yeah it's you can see way too far

485.44 --> 491.52
things don't get slanted the further

488.639 --> 492.0
away they go into the distance and even

491.52 --> 495.44
though there

492.0 --> 498.639
is a bottom-up obstruction or apparent

495.44 --> 501.84
obstruction against concealment rather

498.639 --> 503.919
that's due to optical effects and yeah

501.84 --> 506.479
it's the optical slant effect that i

503.919 --> 511.039
identified years ago

506.479 --> 514.399
through the flat earth debates that

511.039 --> 517.68
thanks to the resolution limit of any

514.399 --> 522.0
observing medium will cause

517.68 --> 526.0
yeah things to compact when observed

522.0 --> 527.839
yeah on top of a plane

526.0 --> 529.92
it's weird how that works but it does

527.839 --> 531.7600000000001
it's them demonstrable

529.92 --> 532.959
flat side made a really good video

531.76 --> 537.36
demonstrating that

532.959 --> 539.76
i posted it the other day ah there we go

537.36 --> 540.9590000000001
there's a baller oh bloody averages of

539.76 --> 543.4399999999999
curvature

540.959 --> 545.4399999999999
except nobody claims the horizon is a

543.44 --> 548.6400000000001
geometric sphere edge

545.44 --> 549.7600000000001
except that part right and the black

548.64 --> 552.24
swan of course

549.76 --> 552.24
patrick

553.68 --> 558.16
you can see too far too low as observer

556.8 --> 561.279
height so it's no

558.16 --> 563.36
no real plenty of evidences for

561.279 --> 564.8
curvature there's actually a complete

563.36 --> 568.24
and utter lack

564.8 --> 568.24
of evidence for curvature

568.56 --> 576.959
there is no curvature none whatsoever

573.519 --> 578.5600000000001
right that's just just the curvature

576.959 --> 581.279
alone

578.56 --> 583.76
it's the vantage point which you yeah

581.279 --> 585.92
you'd have to imagine

583.76 --> 588.399
you're standing on a globe at least

585.92 --> 591.04
right and the only way to really do that

588.399 --> 595.04
is to imagine that it is

591.04 --> 598.24
geometrically curved in reality it isn't

595.04 --> 598.24
and then yeah this

598.32 --> 602.32
piece of science fiction called

599.839 --> 605.6
terrestrial refraction is conjured up

602.32 --> 608.6400000000001
it's arwenian paradox as nathan says it

605.6 --> 613.0400000000001
it's a mathematical paradox it assumes

608.64 --> 614.88
the radius value within the formula

613.04 --> 619.8389999999999
even though it's set out to prove the

614.88 --> 619.8389999999999
radius right

627.6 --> 632.72
and yeah that's just the curvature alone

630.399 --> 635.04
now when it comes to for example

632.72 --> 639.0400000000001
the claim that earth is spinning it is

635.04 --> 639.04
rarely even addressed among globers

640.48 --> 643.76
flat earthers especially nathan likes to

642.72 --> 646.399
bring it up though

643.76 --> 649.04
to bring out globiolus the belief in the

646.399 --> 650.48
coriolis effect that isn't the coriolis

649.04 --> 653.92
effect actually

650.48 --> 656.32
and that supposedly supports the earth

653.92 --> 657.12
spinning even though it's not right the

656.32 --> 659.36
lock stack

657.12 --> 662.48
step movement which can't technically

659.36 --> 662.48
happen with gases

663.44 --> 672.6400000000001
right even though i as a as a globe win

668.16 --> 676.24
or ballwin i think that's what

672.64 --> 680.0
adam called me enemy can

676.24 --> 682.32
even though i defend it i try to right

680.0 --> 684.24
it's in the end it's not really

682.32 --> 686.32
defensible

684.24 --> 688.0790000000001
because there is just no spin and there

686.32 --> 690.399
would be

688.079 --> 691.519
all kinds of constant deviation a

690.399 --> 693.6
constant one

691.519 --> 695.68
not just like oh look it's deviating now

693.6 --> 697.12
oh look it's not deviating now

695.68 --> 700.4799999999999
no no there would be a constant

697.12 --> 700.48
deviation and there isn't

700.839 --> 703.839
really

706.72 --> 710.32
would you mind if i share my video on

709.36 --> 713.6
joshua no

710.32 --> 714.0
i asked specifically at the beginning

713.6 --> 715.76
and

714.0 --> 718.48
yeah at the beginning of my shows to

715.76 --> 721.04
share it on any platform you deem fit

718.48 --> 724.16
hey if you have a social media account

721.04 --> 726.0
whatever that means specifically and you

724.16 --> 727.36
want to share it over there sure fine

726.0 --> 729.839
and if you think it's all

727.36 --> 730.72
funny oh look at this funny flat

729.839 --> 734.24
earthers then

730.72 --> 736.5600000000001
go ahead and drop the video in some ball

734.24 --> 738.0790000000001
earth enthusiast group as well that's

736.56 --> 739.8389999999999
all fine you know if you think it's

738.079 --> 742.399
funny to

739.839 --> 744.8800000000001
to pick on me to make fun of me as a

742.399 --> 748.8
silly flat earther trying to

744.88 --> 751.92
defend flat earth then that's fine too

748.8 --> 755.1999999999999
you know ballers need to score too

751.92 --> 755.92
so i don't mind share it wherever you

755.2 --> 759.36
like

755.92 --> 762.0
i don't care

759.36 --> 764.32
i do care actually in in a positive way

762.0 --> 768.88
i prefer you jared because

764.32 --> 773.839
hey all the globers can all come to me

768.88 --> 773.8389999999999
that's all fine

774.88 --> 779.6
because yeah you can't really peer

778.079 --> 784.8389999999999
pressure me

779.6 --> 787.2
in any sort of form out of yeah

784.839 --> 789.44
relinquishing

787.2 --> 790.399
yeah some counter proof against flat

789.44 --> 793.6
earth right

790.399 --> 795.44
because there isn't any there's barely

793.6 --> 797.2
any claims made except for the

795.44 --> 798.0
geometrical orientation of the earth's

797.2 --> 801.6800000000001
surface

798.0 --> 804.48
not being spherical right or even close

801.68 --> 807.76
to it it's as good as flat

804.48 --> 810.24
that's very little information

807.76 --> 813.68
but not much more information is really

810.24 --> 817.44
required in order to establish this

813.68 --> 820.8
and then once it is established

817.44 --> 823.7600000000001
then you can just move on

820.8 --> 823.76
hey good turn

824.48 --> 828.48
now you can move on and draw natural

826.48 --> 829.519
consequences of what is going on you can

828.48 --> 832.639
observe

829.519 --> 832.9590000000001
situations and for example realize we've

832.639 --> 836.5600000000001
got

832.959 --> 838.399
gas pressure here right

836.56 --> 840.16
take it off for granted all this gas

838.399 --> 841.44
pressure your breathing and that keep

840.16 --> 844.56
things stable

841.44 --> 848.32
right well if we're

844.56 --> 850.399
on some place a ball if you will

848.32 --> 852.32
even though that's been disproven in an

850.399 --> 855.36
outer space that is supposedly an

852.32 --> 858.24
endless vacuum that could not be

855.36 --> 860.72
because the gas pressure could never be

858.24 --> 860.72
stable

861.12 --> 864.48
in order for us to breathe if there

863.68 --> 868.7199999999999
isn't any

864.48 --> 871.36
direct seal to the earth realm

868.72 --> 875.0400000000001
containing this gas in order for it to

871.36 --> 875.04
form gas pressure right here

875.12 --> 878.72
right there's no gas pressure without a

877.44 --> 880.9590000000001
container and

878.72 --> 883.44
according to heliocentrism there isn't

880.959 --> 885.279
any container

883.44 --> 886.72
the gas just sticks to the earth because

885.279 --> 889.04
of supposed gravity

886.72 --> 890.72
even though gravity couldn't even do it

889.04 --> 893.5999999999999
by the standards

890.72 --> 894.32
through which gravity is defined in any

893.6 --> 896.0
form

894.32 --> 897.36
like the mathematical version the

896.0 --> 900.24
einstein gravity

897.36 --> 902.0
can't mathematically do it can't be

900.24 --> 905.279
calculated to do it

902.0 --> 907.12
and newtonian gravity right even though

905.279 --> 909.04
newton never claimed the hypothesis

907.12 --> 913.12
can't do it either it's a weak force

909.04 --> 917.12
it's not strong enough to keep the air

913.12 --> 920.5600000000001
to the ball versus the infinite

917.12 --> 925.12
volume of outer space right and

920.56 --> 928.56
gas pressure expands with as much power

925.12 --> 929.44
as the volume available for it to expand

928.56 --> 931.68
into

929.44 --> 933.0400000000001
so if you just calculate out

931.68 --> 935.8389999999999
conceptually

933.04 --> 936.959
that gas would have a certain power to

935.839 --> 940.0790000000001
expand

936.959 --> 944.0
in an infinite container then there

940.079 --> 946.079
is no force in the universe

944.0 --> 947.6
right in the universe no force

946.079 --> 951.7589999999999
conceivable

947.6 --> 954.16
mathematical conceptual or actual

951.759 --> 956.72
that could stop that gas pressure from

954.16 --> 960.3199999999999
expanding in all directions

956.72 --> 961.36
to attempt and find an equilibrium gas

960.32 --> 964.32
pressure wise

961.36 --> 965.1990000000001
with the container right it can never

964.32 --> 967.519
reach that because

965.199 --> 969.279
the volume is infinite and the gas

967.519 --> 970.24
pressure expansion power would be

969.279 --> 973.36
infinite

970.24 --> 975.36
there would be no stopping it yet

973.36 --> 977.279
we have gas pressure because you're

975.36 --> 978.72
breathing i am breathing we're all

977.279 --> 980.079
breathing here and otherwise you

978.72 --> 985.36
couldn't even see

980.079 --> 988.6389999999999
me saying this so one can only conclude

985.36 --> 989.6
that there is containment a limited

988.639 --> 992.32
containment

989.6 --> 994.72
versus the idea of an infinite outer

992.32 --> 997.1990000000001
space vacuum

994.72 --> 997.759
so yeah there is no infinite outer space

997.199 --> 999.519
vacuum

997.759 --> 1001.44
it doesn't work that way it can't work

999.519 --> 1004.5600000000001
that way it was a big

1001.44 --> 1007.36
suspension of disbelief flaw in the

1004.56 --> 1009.4399999999999
entire conception within heliocentrism

1007.36 --> 1012.0790000000001
that most people overlook because not a

1009.44 --> 1015.759
lot of people really

1012.079 --> 1015.7589999999999
think about physics too much

1017.839 --> 1025.28
i like yeah do even all people

1021.12 --> 1027.52
have physics in school i think that

1025.28 --> 1028.6399999999999
most people get some basic physics and

1027.52 --> 1031.679
then they learn about

1028.64 --> 1032.3190000000002
newton and [ __ ] right and then after

1031.679 --> 1035.199
that

1032.319 --> 1036.1599999999999
people i don't know in school move on to

1035.199 --> 1038.72
other things

1036.16 --> 1040.48
and they probably drop physics unless

1038.72 --> 1042.559
they're kind of like nerdy

1040.48 --> 1044.16
and they really like it like math and

1042.559 --> 1045.6
physics and all that and then they might

1044.16 --> 1047.28
move on

1045.6 --> 1050.559
right and then they may be confronted

1047.28 --> 1054.32
with how newtonian physics may not be

1050.559 --> 1056.08
entirely valid within physics anymore

1054.32 --> 1059.36
but not before

1056.08 --> 1061.6789999999999
so most people will just have

1059.36 --> 1063.76
very basic conceptions of physics will

1061.679 --> 1065.679
learn the newton system

1063.76 --> 1067.76
and not learn so much that it's not

1065.679 --> 1071.44
really relevant anymore or they will

1067.76 --> 1075.679
just be very easy to overlook

1071.44 --> 1078.96
that and that's what's going on

1075.679 --> 1081.2
right so most people don't really know

1078.96 --> 1082.96
don't really know that gas pressure will

1081.2 --> 1085.2
expand in all directions to fill the

1082.96 --> 1088.08
available container

1085.2 --> 1089.8400000000001
or they don't really think about the

1088.08 --> 1093.1999999999998
natural consequences of

1089.84 --> 1096.24
gas expanding within a supposed infinite

1093.2 --> 1098.64
volumed container they won't

1096.24 --> 1101.36
really think about that then like what

1098.64 --> 1104.5590000000002
is really at play

1101.36 --> 1106.8799999999999
right and thus they'll just think like

1104.559 --> 1108.08
yeah sure gas can stick to a ball thanks

1106.88 --> 1109.8400000000001
to gravity even though

1108.08 --> 1112.24
they don't really know what gravity is

1109.84 --> 1114.559
nobody knows because it still yet has to

1112.24 --> 1119.6
be discovered what it really is

1114.559 --> 1123.36
it's just this virtual quest to imagine

1119.6 --> 1127.52
how things objects material

1123.36 --> 1130.32
can be drawn towards a spherical center

1127.52 --> 1131.28
that's really what gravity is the

1130.32 --> 1134.32
necessity

1131.28 --> 1137.44
of a mechanic

1134.32 --> 1141.12
that can lead towards the

1137.44 --> 1143.3600000000001
end result of the all-wanted ball earth

1141.12 --> 1144.559
that's what gravity is it's a concept

1143.36 --> 1147.84
that is

1144.559 --> 1150.96
required in order to imagine the ball

1147.84 --> 1155.1999999999998
right but the mechanics that are now

1150.96 --> 1159.039
woven into this system through gravity

1155.2 --> 1162.16
it doesn't really work out it it doesn't

1159.039 --> 1164.72
fix the situation it doesn't even out

1162.16 --> 1165.52
the mechanics so and they left it pretty

1164.72 --> 1168.72
much open

1165.52 --> 1171.84
just for people to imagine and not

1168.72 --> 1173.6000000000001
not think about it too too elaborately

1171.84 --> 1175.1999999999998
because then problems arrive and

1173.6 --> 1177.12
discussions and

1175.2 --> 1178.4
yeah heated situations people are going

1177.12 --> 1180.08
to get frustrated

1178.4 --> 1181.8400000000001
people might even call you a flat

1180.08 --> 1182.8799999999999
earther just for questioning the

1181.84 --> 1185.76
mechanics

1182.88 --> 1187.6000000000001
of these things because that's what flat

1185.76 --> 1190.32
earthers have been doing a lot

1187.6 --> 1191.76
asking the questions that break the

1190.32 --> 1194.799
model

1191.76 --> 1196.559
and so because we have been doing that

1194.799 --> 1198.96
actively it's just like what somebody's

1196.559 --> 1200.799
asking a question about the mechanics

1198.96 --> 1204.799
saying that it's not possible well then

1200.799 --> 1208.08
they must be a flat earther right

1204.799 --> 1211.84
so just asking questions

1208.08 --> 1213.6
for heliocentrism will lead to people

1211.84 --> 1215.6789999999999
pointing fingers saying you're a flat

1213.6 --> 1218.08
earther because you're asking

1215.679 --> 1220.0
the wrong questions you're you're

1218.08 --> 1221.9189999999999
pointing out flaws in the model

1220.0 --> 1224.159
so you must be a flat earther because

1221.919 --> 1226.159
you're not trusting

1224.159 --> 1228.0800000000002
the consensus that the earth must be a

1226.159 --> 1228.5590000000002
ball because of pictures from outer

1228.08 --> 1231.039
space

1228.559 --> 1233.28
which is impossible and the balls

1231.039 --> 1236.1589999999999
constantly shown on the tv

1233.28 --> 1238.1589999999999
especially by the news in there they

1236.159 --> 1240.5590000000002
can't lie

1238.159 --> 1240.5590000000002
right

1244.4 --> 1249.8400000000001
so finally got chad going

1299.919 --> 1305.8400000000001
thank you for pointing out no volume

1301.76 --> 1305.84
there territ306 thank you

1307.44 --> 1313.1200000000001
yeah yeah sean hawkins you say it's

1310.96 --> 1315.76
measured spherical but i don't

1313.12 --> 1317.6
think you understand what measuring

1315.76 --> 1319.44
really is

1317.6 --> 1321.039
i think you're misunderstanding what

1319.44 --> 1323.8400000000001
measuring means

1321.039 --> 1324.96
now if you say it's been calculated

1323.84 --> 1327.76
derived

1324.96 --> 1330.4
from a certain measured length you know

1327.76 --> 1332.559
as the equator

1330.4 --> 1334.24
yeah i'd say yeah sure you can calculate

1332.559 --> 1336.08
that if you just assume

1334.24 --> 1337.6
a radius if you assume it's

1336.08 --> 1340.24
interconnected

1337.6 --> 1341.12
in spherical fashion and then you just

1340.24 --> 1343.919
conjure it

1341.12 --> 1344.799
into a radius or you transform it you

1343.919 --> 1346.96
transmute it

1344.799 --> 1348.0
into a radius right well that's not

1346.96 --> 1350.559
measuring

1348.0 --> 1352.72
that's calculating based on the

1350.559 --> 1355.2
pre-assumption

1352.72 --> 1356.08
so there is a measured length of some

1355.2 --> 1359.28
form

1356.08 --> 1362.32
and then you assume

1359.28 --> 1363.12
it to be in a certain setup you assume

1362.32 --> 1367.12
it to be

1363.12 --> 1369.6789999999999
in a circle around

1367.12 --> 1370.1589999999999
the earth's surface you assume it as

1369.679 --> 1373.6000000000001
such

1370.159 --> 1377.5200000000002
and that's how you arrive to the

1373.6 --> 1378.799
radius length that's not measuring

1377.52 --> 1382.08
though

1378.799 --> 1385.76
it's calculating it's calculating

1382.08 --> 1388.8799999999999
and it is assuming the geometry

1385.76 --> 1391.28
of the situation namely a circle

1388.88 --> 1392.96
due to the radius that must be there

1391.28 --> 1394.1589999999999
because it's a sphere because that's

1392.96 --> 1397.679
what you're assuming

1394.159 --> 1400.0800000000002
so that's not measuring spherical

1397.679 --> 1403.8400000000001
i'm sorry to disappoint you like that

1400.08 --> 1403.84
but that's not measuring

1407.53 --> 1412.3999999999999
[Music]

1409.76 --> 1414.72
yeah now you're just projecting there

1412.4 --> 1419.039
talking rubbish to confirm your bias

1414.72 --> 1422.0
yeah that's that's absolutely projecting

1419.039 --> 1423.279
because i just gave you a very detailed

1422.0 --> 1426.48
elaborate

1423.279 --> 1428.96
explanation that's not rubbish and it's

1426.48 --> 1430.799
not to confirm any bias it's literally

1428.96 --> 1433.52
pointing out

1430.799 --> 1433.52
what it is

1435.279 --> 1442.72
right so technically even

1438.72 --> 1443.6000000000001
if the earth was actually a sphere which

1442.72 --> 1446.08
it isn't

1443.6 --> 1447.6
right if all that was possible and it is

1446.08 --> 1449.6
a sphere

1447.6 --> 1450.9599999999998
the radius will still not have been

1449.6 --> 1454.48
measured it's still

1450.96 --> 1457.279
assumed it's just that in that case

1454.48 --> 1457.84
yeah the earth would be a sphere which

1457.279 --> 1460.48
makes

1457.84 --> 1461.76
assuming it to be a sphere in order to

1460.48 --> 1464.0
measure it

1461.76 --> 1465.44
a lot easier there's nobody going to

1464.0 --> 1468.48
tell you like yeah

1465.44 --> 1469.44
but it's not a sphere because it is

1468.48 --> 1471.44
actually a sphere

1469.44 --> 1472.559
if it were actually a sphere right and

1471.44 --> 1474.799
then you could say like

1472.559 --> 1476.96
yeah like we got the radius because the

1474.799 --> 1479.44
earth has been confirmed to be a sphere

1476.96 --> 1480.48
so yeah no problem presupposing it in

1479.44 --> 1483.76
any sort of

1480.48 --> 1486.799
derived calculation right

1483.76 --> 1490.24
it's still not measured

1486.799 --> 1493.76
because measuring is measuring

1490.24 --> 1496.32
deriving through calculation is not a

1493.76 --> 1499.039
measurement

1496.32 --> 1499.039
and is that

1499.44 --> 1529.8400000000001
why are you timing him out

1515.84 --> 1529.84
what the hell is he talking about

1531.039 --> 1537.6
oh my god oh

1534.72 --> 1538.4
one of my roommate's mothers is

1537.6 --> 1541.12
apparently

1538.4 --> 1543.2
tested positive for corona so they got a

1541.12 --> 1546.08
new victim

1543.2 --> 1546.72
so they can be all complainy pants about

1546.08 --> 1550.08
it

1546.72 --> 1550.08
and not do anything

1550.799 --> 1555.76
brilliant yeah it is observed off

1553.919 --> 1557.8400000000001
subject nonsense george sanford you're

1555.76 --> 1557.84
right

1558.0 --> 1561.279
i wasn't really reading it

1565.36 --> 1571.84
i literally just heard that by the way

1579.84 --> 1586.48
measuring spherical axis is measuring

1583.44 --> 1590.4
really so how do you measure

1586.48 --> 1590.4
spherical access that's

1591.6 --> 1599.84
let's see

1611.44 --> 1615.76
all right yes spherical excess so that

1613.84 --> 1618.799
is kind of like

1615.76 --> 1620.679
how much drop there would be

1618.799 --> 1622.1589999999999
it's basically figure out through

1620.679 --> 1625.679
triangulation

1622.159 --> 1628.0
on a bit of surface of a presumed sphere

1625.679 --> 1630.96
or of a confirmed sphere

1628.0 --> 1631.36
like how much degrees would be deviating

1630.96 --> 1633.3600000000001
in

1631.36 --> 1635.6789999999999
resulting in how much drop and all that

1633.36 --> 1639.36
right well that's there is no

1635.679 --> 1640.24
curvature though sean that's the problem

1639.36 --> 1645.76
the horizon

1640.24 --> 1650.799
is not a sphere edge it really isn't

1645.76 --> 1650.799
so it's all very cute

1651.6 --> 1655.84
it's not gonna work though

1669.12 --> 1673.279
all right because if you'd be measuring

1671.44 --> 1675.8400000000001
a sphere

1673.279 --> 1677.36
then you'd have to put a ruler next to

1675.84 --> 1679.6
it of some sort

1677.36 --> 1679.6
right

1680.72 --> 1688.64
i know it's easier to just derive

1685.6 --> 1690.399
the information based on an assumption

1688.64 --> 1692.0
that there is a radius in the first

1690.399 --> 1694.0
place but

1692.0 --> 1695.36
measuring is yeah it's like putting a

1694.0 --> 1697.84
ruler next to it

1695.36 --> 1700.32
and then figuring out oh look that ruler

1697.84 --> 1704.32
is touching down

1700.32 --> 1707.2
on the earth at the center

1704.32 --> 1709.2
and then the rest is even though it is

1707.2 --> 1713.3600000000001
confirmed straight

1709.2 --> 1715.919
it's moving away from the horizon or

1713.36 --> 1716.6399999999999
rather the horizon is moving away from

1715.919 --> 1720.7990000000002
it

1716.64 --> 1724.96
from this measured flat stick

1720.799 --> 1727.039
right which would have to be humongous

1724.96 --> 1728.64
technically oh if you do it on a smaller

1727.039 --> 1732.24
sphere it's easier though

1728.64 --> 1732.24
like you take a smaller sphere

1736.84 --> 1744.0
right take a smaller sphere

1741.12 --> 1744.8799999999999
you put a ruler next to it and then see

1744.0 --> 1748.08
look

1744.88 --> 1750.5590000000002
in in the middle

1748.08 --> 1754.08
it's touching down and the further to

1750.559 --> 1758.08
the side you go the further above

1754.08 --> 1761.039
the horizon further

1758.08 --> 1761.84
further above the horizon it becomes

1761.039 --> 1765.279
right

1761.84 --> 1767.76
this is the horizon on this sphere so

1765.279 --> 1769.52
it just moves away into the distance

1767.76 --> 1773.52
there's a touchdown point

1769.52 --> 1775.52
and then it moves above the horizon even

1773.52 --> 1778.8799999999999
though this thing is confirmed

1775.52 --> 1782.96
straight right it's straight

1778.88 --> 1784.98
so yeah that would be a start

1782.96 --> 1788.049
of some kind of measuring attempt

1784.98 --> 1788.049
[Music]

1789.679 --> 1795.8400000000001
because yeah how else do you measure a

1791.919 --> 1795.8400000000001
sphere other than

1800.159 --> 1805.3600000000001
yeah like enveloping it with like a

1803.52 --> 1807.76
measure tape perhaps

1805.36 --> 1811.279
that would stuck in place around the old

1807.76 --> 1815.039
earth right then moving it from

1811.279 --> 1815.52
moving it off it and then seeing like

1815.039 --> 1820.84
yes

1815.52 --> 1822.1589999999999
it is connecting exactly like a circle

1820.84 --> 1825.36
now

1822.159 --> 1826.3990000000001
and there is like this the degree of

1825.36 --> 1828.799
constant

1826.399 --> 1830.1589999999999
and the constant circular angle of this

1828.799 --> 1831.9189999999999
measuring tape

1830.159 --> 1834.48
moved around the earth well these things

1831.919 --> 1835.039
are are obviously not going to happen

1834.48 --> 1837.84
the earth

1835.039 --> 1837.84
isn't a sphere

1851.12 --> 1857.5189999999998
pictures are dismissed

1854.799 --> 1860.559
for your own rules decided to invent

1857.519 --> 1864.08
what are you blabbering about j.u

1860.559 --> 1868.0
no pictures from outer space

1864.08 --> 1871.1999999999998
are not a good option

1868.0 --> 1873.76
because it can't have been there

1871.2 --> 1876.64
it's not an option it's not a logical

1873.76 --> 1879.039
thing that could have happened

1876.64 --> 1880.24
you can't make pictures from a medium

1879.039 --> 1883.44
that doesn't exist

1880.24 --> 1887.1200000000001
because it can't exist that's not a

1883.44 --> 1888.159
invented rule that's the natural

1887.12 --> 1893.84
consequence

1888.159 --> 1893.8400000000001
of physics

1898.159 --> 1902.3200000000002
yeah nathan black swan debunks

1900.32 --> 1904.1589999999999
everything

1902.32 --> 1906.32
pictures are dismissed but not because

1904.159 --> 1908.96
of the black swan but because they

1906.32 --> 1910.08
the pictures are taken in a supposed

1908.96 --> 1912.64
medium

1910.08 --> 1914.08
that can't exist because of physics

1912.64 --> 1914.7990000000002
because of the gas pressure without a

1914.08 --> 1917.9189999999999
container

1914.799 --> 1920.8799999999999
that's his argument that's not invented

1917.919 --> 1923.6000000000001
that's drawing natural logical

1920.88 --> 1923.6000000000001
consequence

1924.0 --> 1930.24
you know you could take

1927.2 --> 1933.1200000000001
whatever the hell picture you like

1930.24 --> 1936.0
and just make a magical universe where

1933.12 --> 1940.32
there's flying unicorns everywhere

1936.0 --> 1943.12
right and there's like floaty castles on

1940.32 --> 1944.08
floaty hills or whatever that's really

1943.12 --> 1948.0
cute

1944.08 --> 1951.36
but yeah it's very easy to conclude

1948.0 --> 1953.039
that's that's not real it's probably

1951.36 --> 1955.84
fiction maybe some cgi

1953.039 --> 1956.24
or something right you know why because

1955.84 --> 1960.72
that

1956.24 --> 1960.72
can't happen those things are physically

1960.84 --> 1966.72
impossible

1963.679 --> 1967.039
right at least to naturally occur like

1966.72 --> 1968.96
that

1967.039 --> 1970.72
it's physically impossible so if you see

1968.96 --> 1972.72
a picture like that it's very easy to

1970.72 --> 1974.0
draw a conclusion like this has to be

1972.72 --> 1977.2
fake

1974.0 --> 1979.76
because those things can't happen have

1977.2 --> 1982.0
never been physically spotted

1979.76 --> 1983.36
in the real world if you just have a

1982.0 --> 1985.039
picture of it doesn't mean

1983.36 --> 1991.84
that it's real just because you have a

1985.039 --> 1991.84
picture of it

1993.76 --> 1996.0
ah

2001.44 --> 2006.24
black swan is proof of a fraction oh you

2004.72 --> 2009.679
mean

2006.24 --> 2013.679
the back black swan forces you

2009.679 --> 2015.44
to conjure up terrestrial refraction

2013.679 --> 2017.519
because otherwise the earth couldn't be

2015.44 --> 2019.8400000000001
a sphere anymore right even though

2017.519 --> 2020.88
terrestrial refraction assumes the

2019.84 --> 2024.1589999999999
radius value

2020.88 --> 2028.5590000000002
within the mathematics of it

2024.159 --> 2033.279
that's all right so it's a paradox

2028.559 --> 2035.44
so yeah your paradoxical conclusion

2033.279 --> 2036.72
proves that the black swan proves the

2035.44 --> 2039.919
earth is a sphere

2036.72 --> 2041.84
no that's literally stretching it that's

2039.919 --> 2047.8400000000001
stretching it beyond

2041.84 --> 2047.84
reason sean hawkins i'm sorry

2053.44 --> 2059.04
how is it a slippery slope ju you're

2055.919 --> 2061.1189999999997
being very annoying

2059.04 --> 2062.079
flat earth is not a slippery slope where

2061.119 --> 2063.9190000000003
you can dismiss

2062.079 --> 2065.8390000000004
everything you can't dismiss things that

2063.919 --> 2068.56
are real

2065.839 --> 2070.639
you can't dismiss things however that

2068.56 --> 2073.44
cannot be

2070.639 --> 2074.079
because they are physically impossible

2073.44 --> 2077.52
based on

2074.079 --> 2077.52
physics right

2078.079 --> 2082.0
that's that's not just oh it the earth

2080.0 --> 2084.079
is flat so i can dismiss everything oh

2082.0 --> 2086.72
no absolutely not you can't dismiss

2084.079 --> 2087.2000000000003
everything but you can dismiss things

2086.72 --> 2090.7999999999997
that

2087.2 --> 2091.839
are physically impossible that part you

2090.8 --> 2094.3990000000003
can dismiss

2091.839 --> 2097.7599999999998
it's not everything though it's most

2094.399 --> 2097.7599999999998
baller claims though

2100.839 --> 2103.839
right

2104.06 --> 2107.349
[Music]

2110.16 --> 2117.839
hello ben and sarah

2123.2 --> 2130.56
sean hawkins he is

2126.88 --> 2133.839
in chat here right now chatting

2130.56 --> 2135.839
with you debating with you sean hawkins

2133.839 --> 2138.96
in text form

2135.839 --> 2140.0
nathan is not in a safe space room right

2138.96 --> 2144.7200000000003
now

2140.0 --> 2147.839
you understand so it's like oh debate me

2144.72 --> 2151.5989999999997
no he is debating you

2147.839 --> 2152.96
right now in my chat right now sean

2151.599 --> 2159.839
hawkins

2152.96 --> 2159.839
this is not nathan's safe space

2160.0 --> 2164.079
this is not a debate no it isn't because

2162.48 --> 2167.839
you have no arguments

2164.079 --> 2170.079
you're a dumbass sean hawkins that's why

2167.839 --> 2170.88
it's not because the platform is not

2170.079 --> 2173.76
good enough

2170.88 --> 2175.44
what not good enough to make you assert

2173.76 --> 2178.2400000000002
absolute nonsense and then

2175.44 --> 2180.16
back you up all the way no that's that's

2178.24 --> 2183.359
not that this platform that's right this

2180.16 --> 2186.16
is a kind of a neutral platform

2183.359 --> 2186.48
where yeah ballers baller believers are

2186.16 --> 2189.44
not

2186.48 --> 2190.48
pampered too that's right that is not

2189.44 --> 2194.48
this platform this

2190.48 --> 2194.48
platform is actually kind of neutral

2199.2 --> 2202.77
[Music]

2205.06 --> 2209.869
[Music]

2212.56 --> 2217.44
yeah yeah you stop whining to nathan

2215.599 --> 2218.88
about that everything is fake your

2217.44 --> 2221.28
solipsism

2218.88 --> 2223.599
is your own don't project that onto

2221.28 --> 2226.6400000000003
nathan

2223.599 --> 2230.0
i've i personally have addressed you now

2226.64 --> 2232.48
in this chat for over five minutes

2230.0 --> 2234.88
if you keep on pushing that [ __ ]

2232.48 --> 2242.079
that everything is fake i will

2234.88 --> 2245.28
ban you just so you know

2242.079 --> 2246.8
i a fan of legolas well there are

2245.28 --> 2251.0400000000004
certain people that call me

2246.8 --> 2257.8390000000004
legolas chocolate saiyan

2251.04 --> 2257.839
especially when i need to shut up

2260.4 --> 2264.4
do i like legolas or do i like a

2262.64 --> 2266.48
fictional character

2264.4 --> 2268.839
oh yeah i kind of like the fictional

2266.48 --> 2271.359
character of legolas i think he's an

2268.839 --> 2273.52
interesting character with a lot of

2271.359 --> 2277.2799999999997
spunk and a lot of forte

2273.52 --> 2279.839
and of course the legendary elven skills

2277.28 --> 2282.2400000000002
right so yeah i liked legolas i've

2279.839 --> 2285.2799999999997
always liked that character

2282.24 --> 2286.0
like even before the movie now funnily

2285.28 --> 2287.92
enough

2286.0 --> 2290.72
there's a lot of people that say that

2287.92 --> 2294.32
look i look like orlando bloom

2290.72 --> 2298.8799999999997
which is the actor that plays legolas

2294.32 --> 2301.3590000000004
so in that way yeah sure

2298.88 --> 2302.0
i guess i do look like him never meant

2301.359 --> 2304.72
to though

2302.0 --> 2306.079
but it is funny it is funny that that is

2304.72 --> 2309.2799999999997
the case

2306.079 --> 2312.2400000000002
i'm just not very blonde

2309.28 --> 2313.599
definitely not so i'm more of a half elf

2312.24 --> 2317.1189999999997
kind of situation

2313.599 --> 2320.7200000000003
literally and yeah legolas is a full

2317.119 --> 2322.6400000000003
wood elf so right

2320.72 --> 2324.56
but this has nothing to do with the flat

2322.64 --> 2327.2799999999997
earth so it's a nice distraction there

2324.56 --> 2328.7999999999997
nice attempt

2327.28 --> 2331.0400000000004
we're still going to talk about flat

2328.8 --> 2335.599
earth and how it's not a globe

2331.04 --> 2335.599
and how we have a lot of evidence for

2338.839 --> 2341.839
that

2357.119 --> 2364.0
what are you talking about ju is

2361.119 --> 2365.04
we need to be smarter like your team of

2364.0 --> 2368.079
scientists

2365.04 --> 2373.68
what on your channel nathan

2368.079 --> 2373.6800000000003
level-headed perfection terrified what

2373.92 --> 2383.839
like what are you saying

2385.839 --> 2389.52
oh the same thing as a rebuttal oh you

2388.88 --> 2392.7200000000003
need

2389.52 --> 2397.839
you need us to say it in different ways

2392.72 --> 2397.839
then john how about you actually

2398.48 --> 2404.079
listen to that rebuttal

2401.68 --> 2406.0789999999997
not just let it repeat over and over

2404.079 --> 2407.92
again so you can ignore it over and over

2406.079 --> 2412.079
again why don't you actually

2407.92 --> 2415.52
respond to the rebuttal nathan

2412.079 --> 2415.52
is doing over and over again

2417.839 --> 2422.64
or you don't like being presented with

2420.88 --> 2424.8
winning arguments against

2422.64 --> 2439.839
against your belief is that it john

2424.8 --> 2439.8390000000004
hawkins you having trouble with that

2445.92 --> 2454.0
are you blabbering bad

2452.16 --> 2456.0789999999997
all right the water vapor not being a

2454.0 --> 2456.88
gas i think nathan brought that up

2456.079 --> 2461.76
because

2456.88 --> 2465.119
you sean hawkins said that

2461.76 --> 2468.3190000000004
you actually put yourself behind that

2465.119 --> 2470.0
openly on multiple occasions

2468.319 --> 2471.92
i think that's why nathan likes to bring

2470.0 --> 2474.48
it up to remind you

2471.92 --> 2476.319
that you're really dumb because you

2474.48 --> 2478.56
actually backed somebody

2476.319 --> 2480.48
when they said and you didn't retract it

2478.56 --> 2481.92
you didn't realize at some point like oh

2480.48 --> 2485.44
wait no no no that's wrong

2481.92 --> 2488.48
no you double down on that gas

2485.44 --> 2489.119
water vapor is not a gas you did sean

2488.48 --> 2492.96
hawkins

2489.119 --> 2496.2400000000002
i remember that it's on video

2492.96 --> 2498.8
so oh then you're correct two days later

2496.24 --> 2498.7999999999997
two days

2499.44 --> 2502.7200000000003
that's a lot of time

2502.96 --> 2506.56
but it's good that you corrected that

2505.92 --> 2509.2000000000003
should have

2506.56 --> 2511.2
probably done it as it was transpiring

2509.2 --> 2513.5989999999997
though

2511.2 --> 2515.52
but i guess you're a little slow like

2513.599 --> 2518.96
that

2515.52 --> 2522.079
pretty sure people have immediately

2518.96 --> 2522.7200000000003
told you immediately in the comments

2522.079 --> 2525.2000000000003
like

2522.72 --> 2527.16
sean this is ridiculous are you saying

2525.2 --> 2530.24
that water vapor isn't gas

2527.16 --> 2534.839
immediately so what took you

2530.24 --> 2537.2
two days to correct that

2534.839 --> 2540.319
sean why did that take you

2537.2 --> 2542.64
two days to correct when

2540.319 --> 2543.599
obviously you were immediately

2542.64 --> 2546.8799999999997
confronted

2543.599 --> 2546.88
with that it was [ __ ]

2547.2 --> 2551.839
what's your excuse for that john

2562.09 --> 2565.219
[Music]

2565.359 --> 2579.839
yeah okay you can [ __ ] off now

2582.22 --> 2585.3999999999996
[Music]

2589.599 --> 2593.119
you thought about it and talked to

2591.52 --> 2596.48
people and researched it

2593.119 --> 2599.6800000000003
what you had you took two days

2596.48 --> 2604.88
taste to talk to people and research why

2599.68 --> 2604.8799999999997
water vapor is not a gas

2604.96 --> 2611.119
because you claimed it was not a gas

2608.0 --> 2614.079
what you so you did a full

2611.119 --> 2618.1600000000003
two day research to figure out that

2614.079 --> 2620.1600000000003
water vapor is actually a gas wow

2618.16 --> 2621.839
why did you need two days to do to

2620.16 --> 2622.96
figure that one out and it's good that

2621.839 --> 2625.04
you did though but

2622.96 --> 2627.04
why did that take two days because

2625.04 --> 2631.7599999999998
literally every person in the world

2627.04 --> 2631.7599999999998
could just pretty much instantly say

2631.839 --> 2636.64
it's like yeah it is a gas the vapor

2634.0 --> 2639.04
part means that it is water in gas form

2636.64 --> 2640.56
that should not take you two days

2639.04 --> 2649.839
to figure that out it's good that you

2640.56 --> 2649.839
did though

2656.88 --> 2662.0
but that water vapor doesn't create our

2660.96 --> 2665.44
gradient that's the

2662.0 --> 2666.56
point oh no now that you're correct sean

2665.44 --> 2669.52
hawkins it's not

2666.56 --> 2670.4
water vapor that creates the gradient it

2669.52 --> 2675.2
is

2670.4 --> 2677.92
the limited volume of the container

2675.2 --> 2679.9199999999996
that allows the gradient because yeah

2677.92 --> 2681.6800000000003
when gas pressure can be allowed to

2679.92 --> 2684.88
settle because there isn't an

2681.68 --> 2687.1189999999997
infinite volume for it to expand into

2684.88 --> 2689.2000000000003
then other effects after the gas

2687.119 --> 2690.56
pressure has settled within the volume

2689.2 --> 2692.24
of the container then

2690.56 --> 2694.56
things can happen to it and then can

2692.24 --> 2697.52
form a gradient to whatever

2694.56 --> 2699.52
right whatever effects happen relative

2697.52 --> 2700.56
density this equilibrium cause the

2699.52 --> 2703.28
gradient

2700.56 --> 2705.04
one could argue the dynamic system of

2703.28 --> 2705.8390000000004
the earth's surface heating up causes

2705.04 --> 2708.96
the gradient

2705.839 --> 2712.4
but all these things can only happen

2708.96 --> 2716.16
because there is a limited volume

2712.4 --> 2718.8
for gas pressure to press against

2716.16 --> 2720.3999999999996
and then do other secondary effects like

2718.8 --> 2722.5600000000004
a gradient

2720.4 --> 2723.6800000000003
it's only possible because there is no

2722.56 --> 2733.839
infinite volume

2723.68 --> 2733.839
for the gas to escape into permanently

2738.319 --> 2742.4
right yeah you don't have to show a

2740.4 --> 2745.6800000000003
container

2742.4 --> 2748.079
to conclude it has to be there

2745.68 --> 2749.52
you can just realize that you're

2748.079 --> 2751.119
breathing

2749.52 --> 2752.8
and that there is a gas pressure

2751.119 --> 2755.119
gradient

2752.8 --> 2756.079
both factors that there is a gas

2755.119 --> 2757.44
pressure gradient

2756.079 --> 2759.3590000000004
there's gas pressure in the first

2757.44 --> 2762.4
instance or that your breathing

2759.359 --> 2764.44
is absolute indication that there is a

2762.4 --> 2768.8
very specific

2764.44 --> 2768.8
non-altering limited volume

2770.48 --> 2775.04
it's a natural consequence an antecedent

2773.28 --> 2779.2000000000003
relationship

2775.04 --> 2782.72
so you don't have to measure

2779.2 --> 2785.5989999999997
anything or point out specifically

2782.72 --> 2787.4399999999996
where a barrier is or anything in order

2785.599 --> 2790.079
to establish

2787.44 --> 2791.119
through the antecedent relationship that

2790.079 --> 2794.6400000000003
there is

2791.119 --> 2796.48
containment of some sort

2794.64 --> 2798.72
and with containment i mean actual

2796.48 --> 2799.28
containment not fictional containment

2798.72 --> 2802.7999999999997
where you

2799.28 --> 2804.7200000000003
imagine gravity to form some kind of a

2802.8 --> 2807.76
containment field

2804.72 --> 2810.0789999999997
right which it isn't can't be

2807.76 --> 2811.0400000000004
not really not in the current setup i

2810.079 --> 2813.44
can

2811.04 --> 2815.44
definitely figure out how that works but

2813.44 --> 2821.44
that'll cost you six million

2815.44 --> 2821.44
at least probably up my price eventually

2827.2 --> 2831.5989999999997
you don't have to presuppose a container

2829.2 --> 2833.68
for a flat earth

2831.599 --> 2835.3590000000004
you don't have to you just have to see

2833.68 --> 2837.52
that there is gas pressure you're

2835.359 --> 2839.7599999999998
breathing

2837.52 --> 2842.4
that's not presupposing that is like a

2839.76 --> 2844.88
natural consequence you're breathing

2842.4 --> 2846.4
so you don't need to presuppose you know

2844.88 --> 2848.2400000000002
you know

2846.4 --> 2849.6800000000003
there's no presuppose you know with

2848.24 --> 2852.72
certainty that there is

2849.68 --> 2856.0789999999997
a container with a limited volume

2852.72 --> 2861.04
or you could not be breathing

2856.079 --> 2861.04
that's not presupposing that's a fact

2868.96 --> 2887.839
patrick who stopped whining

2872.559 --> 2887.8390000000004
to nathan i mean it

2892.16 --> 2895.2799999999997
oh god

2896.559 --> 2900.0
it doesn't seem to matter how many

2898.48 --> 2903.359
freaking times i addressed this

2900.0 --> 2903.359
you're just going to ignore it

2908.0 --> 2914.319
look sean whatever pulling

2911.359 --> 2915.359
or division or forces are present within

2914.319 --> 2918.64
the realm

2915.359 --> 2921.68
it's secondary because some kind of pull

2918.64 --> 2925.5989999999997
a non-physical barrier based

2921.68 --> 2928.3999999999996
container cannot contain effectively gas

2925.599 --> 2932.48
pressure that's not a possibility

2928.4 --> 2935.119
it might slow it down slightly

2932.48 --> 2936.48
as it explosively expands in all

2935.119 --> 2939.6800000000003
directions to

2936.48 --> 2941.2
attempt to fill the presumed infinite

2939.68 --> 2943.5989999999997
volume

2941.2 --> 2944.319
can slow it down slightly it can't

2943.599 --> 2947.6800000000003
actually

2944.319 --> 2951.68
prevent it from continuing

2947.68 --> 2954.7999999999997
expanding that's technically

2951.68 --> 2956.0
not a possibility that's a fact that's

2954.8 --> 2961.2000000000003
even a fat

2956.0 --> 2964.079
fact from within your spherical science

2961.2 --> 2965.9199999999996
right it can't do that it's not said to

2964.079 --> 2969.3590000000004
be able to do that now you can

2965.92 --> 2972.4
calculate it by misunderstanding weight

2969.359 --> 2975.5989999999997
and ignoring gas pressure expansion

2972.4 --> 2976.2400000000002
you could calculate something imagine

2975.599 --> 2978.559
like gas

2976.24 --> 2980.4799999999996
is just like a liquid piling onto the

2978.559 --> 2983.599
next layer and all that

2980.48 --> 2986.079
but in actual physical reality

2983.599 --> 2987.52
that's literally a misunderstanding a

2986.079 --> 2990.079
reification

2987.52 --> 2990.88
of a misinterpretation of how physics

2990.079 --> 2994.0
works it's

2990.88 --> 2996.1600000000003
literally a misunderstanding

2994.0 --> 2998.16
that you're counting on in order to

2996.16 --> 3001.359
imagine gravity

2998.16 --> 3004.8799999999997
to form a container

3001.359 --> 3008.48
a misunderstanding of how things work

3004.88 --> 3013.839
it can't work like that

3008.48 --> 3013.839
it's impossible

3025.359 --> 3030.48
hawkins was a fake lizard oh really no

3028.64 --> 3032.0789999999997
it was just a puppet in a wheelchair

3030.48 --> 3035.599
being wheeled around and

3032.079 --> 3036.48
yeah a bunch of gravelers basically

3035.599 --> 3040.1600000000003
making him say

3036.48 --> 3042.8
[ __ ] through the the translator device

3040.16 --> 3045.839
so it's just a wheelchair puppet

3042.8 --> 3048.88
spouting heliocentric nonsense

3045.839 --> 3052.0789999999997
as an act that's what that's what

3048.88 --> 3052.079
stephen hawkins was

3052.72 --> 3059.2
he died right i'm not sure yeah

3055.92 --> 3062.88
whatever but i think that he he died

3059.2 --> 3065.7599999999998
like in the 20th century still so

3062.88 --> 3066.559
because that disease he had you can't

3065.76 --> 3069.8390000000004
survive that

3066.559 --> 3069.8390000000004
it's impossible

3073.599 --> 3081.839
no michokaku is just a living person

3078.48 --> 3084.559
he's not being controlled hechukaku

3081.839 --> 3085.68
actually reveals incredible amounts of

3084.559 --> 3089.119
truth

3085.68 --> 3089.1189999999997
in a very clever way

3089.92 --> 3095.359
so i think that michio kaku is probably

3092.64 --> 3096.24
the least controlled astronomer out

3095.359 --> 3099.5989999999997
there

3096.24 --> 3102.9599999999996
or astrophysicist i'm i'm

3099.599 --> 3102.96
i'm for real with this

3103.119 --> 3108.6400000000003
he's not controlled he is

3105.68 --> 3108.64
self-sufficient

3109.04 --> 3112.4
he spouts aliens yeah well maybe he just

3111.2 --> 3115.5989999999997
believes in aliens

3112.4 --> 3119.599
you know you don't even necessarily

3115.599 --> 3121.839
need to have heliocentrism

3119.599 --> 3124.2400000000002
in your belief system to believe in

3121.839 --> 3126.64
aliens because what are aliens

3124.24 --> 3129.04
maybe there are some kind of weird

3126.64 --> 3129.04
things

3132.0 --> 3137.599
like related spirits

3135.119 --> 3139.359
or maybe maybe just spirits from another

3137.599 --> 3141.2000000000003
realm

3139.359 --> 3144.48
there's all kinds of things you can

3141.2 --> 3148.7999999999997
believe in you don't need heliocentrism

3144.48 --> 3153.359
for that everything is possible

3148.8 --> 3155.599
in a flat earth realm a lot is possible

3153.359 --> 3157.7599999999998
there's just no warp speed because

3155.599 --> 3160.88
there's no infinite volume to screw

3157.76 --> 3164.4
around in like a giant empty sandbox

3160.88 --> 3167.52
with planets in it that's not possible

3164.4 --> 3170.88
right but other than that

3167.52 --> 3173.28
there is a lot possible

3170.88 --> 3174.7200000000003
and even a lot that we don't yet know

3173.28 --> 3178.3190000000004
about this realm

3174.72 --> 3178.319
and perhaps nobody does

3178.64 --> 3182.16
because yeah they're not allowed to go

3181.44 --> 3185.04
there

3182.16 --> 3186.319
or it's there's just no short-term

3185.04 --> 3188.4
reason to do it

3186.319 --> 3190.48
like there is obstacles that are too

3188.4 --> 3192.8
difficult to overcome and it's not worth

3190.48 --> 3196.16
the investment and risk

3192.8 --> 3199.92
like that kind of like crossing a giant

3196.16 --> 3201.7599999999998
ice desert a giant one

3199.92 --> 3202.96
like maybe that is required maybe it's

3201.76 --> 3204.96
just too difficult

3202.96 --> 3206.64
maybe it has been attempted in the past

3204.96 --> 3209.28
and it was just

3206.64 --> 3209.7599999999998
so impactful that they're not doing it

3209.28 --> 3212.3190000000004
again

3209.76 --> 3214.6400000000003
because it's just not worth it right

3212.319 --> 3216.319
like operation high jump

3214.64 --> 3223.839
potentially could have been one of these

3216.319 --> 3223.839
things moving to the other realm

3225.04 --> 3228.88
but it's probably too difficult

3233.76 --> 3239.92
satellites are just big antenna stations

3237.92 --> 3241.52
you don't need satellites everything

3239.92 --> 3244.88
satellites do can

3241.52 --> 3248.079
easily easily and cheaply function

3244.88 --> 3248.079
within the flat earth realm

3248.48 --> 3257.2
flat earth makes radio communication

3253.28 --> 3260.559
a lot a lot easier

3257.2 --> 3260.5589999999997
so much more efficient

3262.8 --> 3269.2000000000003
and cheaper too by the way so

3265.839 --> 3273.839
yeah you don't need emergency

3269.2 --> 3277.2799999999997
surface app on your freaking satellite

3273.839 --> 3280.24
it's [ __ ] you don't

3277.28 --> 3282.1600000000003
need satellites you just need radio

3280.24 --> 3284.5589999999997
communication and you don't need

3282.16 --> 3286.319
satellites they can't exist in that

3284.559 --> 3288.7200000000003
fashion they can you can't spin around a

3286.319 --> 3290.4
presupposed spherical earth

3288.72 --> 3293.7599999999998
without being pulled down by relative

3290.4 --> 3298.319
density that's not possible

3293.76 --> 3301.5200000000004
right but you don't need that anyway

3298.319 --> 3304.319
you just need really high towers

3301.52 --> 3304.64
that send the signal very far away yeah

3304.319 --> 3307.119
yeah

3304.64 --> 3308.72
and then you can call it gps that's

3307.119 --> 3311.2000000000003
really nice

3308.72 --> 3313.68
just call it global just call that big

3311.2 --> 3315.7599999999998
freaking antenna global

3313.68 --> 3317.04
and then everybody can imagine how it's

3315.76 --> 3318.96
all going around the earth and

3317.04 --> 3320.24
reflecting off satellite yeah it's very

3318.96 --> 3323.359
easy to imagine

3320.24 --> 3326.319
yeah especially with the freaking cgi

3323.359 --> 3327.68
that's been rammed into every [ __ ]

3326.319 --> 3330.4
little movie

3327.68 --> 3331.8799999999997
and news bulletin and shitty

3330.4 --> 3334.559
announcement video

3331.88 --> 3335.92
advertisement [ __ ] advertisement

3334.559 --> 3339.52
everywhere you

3335.92 --> 3341.44
see that [ __ ] image some satellites

3339.52 --> 3343.04
go around the earth doing whatever oh

3341.44 --> 3344.48
super weapon shuttle i know

3343.04 --> 3346.799
the rockets on the satellite they're

3344.48 --> 3348.96
settling yeah yeah overexposure of a

3346.799 --> 3352.64
concept that is completely

3348.96 --> 3356.4
superfluous you don't need

3352.64 --> 3358.799
satellites to have very efficient

3356.4 --> 3360.839
very long distance communication you

3358.799 --> 3363.359
don't need

3360.839 --> 3365.52
satellites right

3363.359 --> 3368.319
you don't need it now if you want

3365.52 --> 3370.079
pictures from way up there

3368.319 --> 3372.16
then you'll have to have something

3370.079 --> 3373.6800000000003
physical up there in some way or you

3372.16 --> 3376.96
could use a zeppelin

3373.68 --> 3380.24
or maybe a set loon for a short period

3376.96 --> 3380.799
or maybe just a yeah a plane that can

3380.24 --> 3384.24
fly

3380.799 --> 3384.88
very high and you just photograph

3384.24 --> 3387.1189999999997
everything

3384.88 --> 3389.04
just fly over click click click click

3387.119 --> 3392.559
there you got your images

3389.04 --> 3394.0
right and the rest well most can just

3392.559 --> 3395.8390000000004
simply be

3394.0 --> 3398.4
radio communicated just constant

3395.839 --> 3400.16
communication

3398.4 --> 3402.0
and then coordination you don't need

3400.16 --> 3404.799
pictures in order to

3402.0 --> 3405.359
have a coordination grid system you

3404.799 --> 3406.799
don't need

3405.359 --> 3408.4
pictures for that necessary you don't

3406.799 --> 3411.599
need a physical thing up there

3408.4 --> 3412.88
to achieve that necessarily just need a

3411.599 --> 3419.839
line of sight with

3412.88 --> 3419.839
the main antennas

3426.72 --> 3430.48
gta 5 is a mission to destroy that gives

3429.76 --> 3447.8390000000004
a [ __ ]

3430.48 --> 3447.839
i hate that [ __ ] game

3464.079 --> 3468.96
yeah and what's that supposed to do then

3466.64 --> 3468.96
dart

3471.359 --> 3477.68
what's your three-word emergency surface

3474.96 --> 3478.799
thingy app well what's why are you

3477.68 --> 3489.839
supposed to have that

3478.799 --> 3489.839
what good is that what is it doing

3490.32 --> 3493.8990000000003
[Music]

3500.839 --> 3505.44
so

3502.4 --> 3507.6800000000003
look it up no i'm not looking it up

3505.44 --> 3509.68
you [ __ ] say what it does or i'm

3507.68 --> 3512.48
banning you dart

3509.68 --> 3512.799
don't freaking advertise for something

3512.48 --> 3515.119
and

3512.799 --> 3516.72
i'm not even goddamn say what it is you

3515.119 --> 3519.28
piece of [ __ ]

3516.72 --> 3521.839
say what it is or i'm banning you not

3519.28 --> 3526.0
gonna look it up for you

3521.839 --> 3526.0
you're the one that's putting it in my

3528.839 --> 3531.839
chat

3538.48 --> 3545.839
unless you don't know you just saw

3541.599 --> 3545.839
something in a distant

3547.2 --> 3553.839
yeah yeah i know coordination systems

3550.319 --> 3556.4
right coordination is very handy

3553.839 --> 3557.119
when you when you can have like radio

3556.4 --> 3559.839
signals

3557.119 --> 3561.599
triangulate exactly where you are that's

3559.839 --> 3564.319
very handy yeah yeah

3561.599 --> 3566.48
has nothing to do with a freaking

3564.319 --> 3568.079
presupposed spherical earth though even

3566.48 --> 3568.96
though it has the word globe in it

3568.079 --> 3572.079
that's very

3568.96 --> 3575.119
cute the word globe in it does

3572.079 --> 3577.04
not prove the earth is a globe it only

3575.119 --> 3580.1600000000003
proves that people like you are

3577.04 --> 3580.96
very easily indoctrinated that's what it

3580.16 --> 3582.48
proves

3580.96 --> 3585.04
that's why it's so effective you just

3582.48 --> 3587.44
put the freaking word globe on whatever

3585.04 --> 3588.4
actually disproves the globe and people

3587.44 --> 3591.68
like you

3588.4 --> 3595.839
will take it will see the word globe

3591.68 --> 3598.72
and then say see it proves it's a globe

3595.839 --> 3600.319
because the [ __ ] word globe is in it

3598.72 --> 3615.839
and i'm a [ __ ]

3600.319 --> 3615.839
right darth

3623.59 --> 3626.76
[Music]

3640.839 --> 3643.839
ah

3651.839 --> 3659.2799999999997
uh yeah

3656.079 --> 3663.44
yeah rufus erda is just

3659.28 --> 3666.2400000000002
other language earth it's just earth in

3663.44 --> 3666.2400000000002
german i think

3668.079 --> 3671.8390000000004
not sure let me look that up

3687.839 --> 3690.72
oh that's funny

3696.839 --> 3701.359
hmm

3698.0 --> 3707.119
when i looked it up erda is actually an

3701.359 --> 3709.839
old english name derived from earth

3707.119 --> 3709.839
that's funny

3716.96 --> 3727.839
ah it's yeah it is from german only with

3719.839 --> 3727.839
it's not with an a but with an erd

3736.72 --> 3743.0389999999998
all right whatever

3740.799 --> 3745.0389999999998
it's just scatter gunning now anyway

3743.039 --> 3746.559
it's like why don't you just go away

3745.039 --> 3749.28
ballers

3746.559 --> 3750.1600000000003
i've literally just spent an hour

3749.28 --> 3754.48
detailing

3750.16 --> 3756.72
every freaking detail of the earth

3754.48 --> 3758.079
every detail and now you're just

3756.72 --> 3761.1189999999997
nonsense

3758.079 --> 3761.6800000000003
spouting nonsense scattered gunning off

3761.119 --> 3764.1600000000003
into

3761.68 --> 3765.44
nonsense details like oh this is very

3764.16 --> 3768.319
curious to zoom into

3765.44 --> 3770.16
right now now that i've been utterly

3768.319 --> 3772.48
demolished in my global beliefs

3770.16 --> 3774.319
let's just move on to some nonsensical

3772.48 --> 3776.2400000000002
detail and start

3774.319 --> 3778.96
getting everybody all riled up about

3776.24 --> 3782.0789999999997
that so that we can quickly forget those

3778.96 --> 3785.599
hard core fundamental arguments

3782.079 --> 3787.92
that absolutely destroy your globe

3785.599 --> 3789.52
right so let's quickly move on to some

3787.92 --> 3792.2400000000002
nonsense

3789.52 --> 3794.72
right that's what you want or you could

3792.24 --> 3797.839
just get the [ __ ] out

3794.72 --> 3797.839
and stop wasting our time

3810.48 --> 3816.48
yeah go watch back when the show

3813.92 --> 3818.16
i spent an hour on that i'm not going to

3816.48 --> 3822.2400000000002
do it all over again

3818.16 --> 3825.839
you got it just watch back

3822.24 --> 3825.839
right now

3829.119 --> 3839.839
i addressed every single thing

3833.2 --> 3839.839
right every single thing

3856.4 --> 3860.2400000000002
the maverick water doesn't it doesn't

3858.319 --> 3862.4
matter if water curves or not

3860.24 --> 3864.64
how is that relevant to everything every

3862.4 --> 3866.0
time some stupid flat earther rings of

3864.64 --> 3868.64
water doesn't curve

3866.0 --> 3869.039
yeah guess what you just did you just

3868.64 --> 3871.0389999999998
gave

3869.039 --> 3873.5200000000004
ballers a whole bunch of squirting room

3871.039 --> 3876.4
to start whining about water

3873.52 --> 3878.079
dust kerf because sometimes water does

3876.4 --> 3879.359
curve there's surface tension there's

3878.079 --> 3882.1600000000003
all these influences

3879.359 --> 3886.24
every time somebody says that you give

3882.16 --> 3886.24
the ballers more room to squirt

3886.559 --> 3892.2400000000002
water curving or being flat is not

3889.119 --> 3892.2400000000002
relevant to anything

3892.4 --> 3899.119
because water does curve it does

3895.599 --> 3902.48
curve it just doesn't do so

3899.119 --> 3904.2400000000002
on a vast vast scale

3902.48 --> 3906.64
right because surface tension only

3904.24 --> 3908.0
really works on the smaller scale so the

3906.64 --> 3911.52
bigger the body of water

3908.0 --> 3914.88
the more flat it'll become

3911.52 --> 3919.119
water does curve though it just does not

3914.88 --> 3921.92
adapt to sphericity

3919.119 --> 3923.76
because nothing adapts to sphericity so

3921.92 --> 3927.359
it's not even relevant to bring up

3923.76 --> 3930.48
why water would be non-spherical

3927.359 --> 3930.88
it simply settles water settles there is

3930.48 --> 3934.96
some

3930.88 --> 3940.0
curviness to it here and there ripples

3934.96 --> 3940.0
round corners all that right

3940.72 --> 3945.68
it's not relevant whether it is not

3943.039 --> 3945.6800000000003
spherical

3949.44 --> 3956.0
yeah it levels that's right it levels

3952.88 --> 3959.28
water levels it also curves though

3956.0 --> 3963.359
it just does not curve

3959.28 --> 3967.3590000000004
out there like the oceans

3963.359 --> 3969.2799999999997
geometrical orientation how it settles

3967.359 --> 3971.7599999999998
that's not spherical because the earth

3969.28 --> 3974.96
is not spherical to settle towards

3971.76 --> 3977.28
it just settles flat water on itself

3974.96 --> 3980.64
as a material yeah it can definitely

3977.28 --> 3983.6800000000003
curve so every time you bring that up

3980.64 --> 3985.2
endless nonsense from ballers you

3983.68 --> 3988.64
unleash on that moment

3985.2 --> 3990.3999999999996
just think about it i never ring it up

3988.64 --> 3992.0789999999997
because it's always as soon as some flat

3990.4 --> 3992.559
earther brings a little water doesn't

3992.079 --> 3995.52
curve

3992.559 --> 3996.3190000000004
guess what you just gave like 10 or 20

3995.52 --> 3999.2
dollars

3996.319 --> 4001.599
an hour whining room to in their heads

3999.2 --> 4004.3999999999996
like oh but that's wrong

4001.599 --> 4005.839
because that's what it is every time you

4004.4 --> 4008.799
say something that's

4005.839 --> 4010.0789999999997
not perfect you give ballers an hour

4008.799 --> 4012.48
squirting room of

4010.079 --> 4014.799
whining and imagining of how stupid you

4012.48 --> 4020.16
are for not being perfectly correct

4014.799 --> 4023.2
don't do it just don't

4020.16 --> 4026.5589999999997
just don't don't say water

4023.2 --> 4027.9199999999996
isn't spherical because sometimes water

4026.559 --> 4031.599
is spherical and it does

4027.92 --> 4032.64
curve it just not out it doesn't do it

4031.599 --> 4034.799
out there because

4032.64 --> 4036.64
yeah the surface it's settling on it's

4034.799 --> 4040.48
not spherical

4036.64 --> 4043.359
right so it has nothing to do with water

4040.48 --> 4044.799
if you're going to say look the ocean

4043.359 --> 4046.72
surface

4044.799 --> 4048.079
the average ocean surface the

4046.72 --> 4050.72
geometrical orientation

4048.079 --> 4051.92
of the surface of the ocean is not

4050.72 --> 4055.0389999999998
spherical

4051.92 --> 4058.0
now that would be correct water

4055.039 --> 4059.599
universally yeah water can damn well

4058.0 --> 4063.2
curve

4059.599 --> 4066.079
so to say that is just wrong it gives

4063.2 --> 4067.2799999999997
ballers more squirting room don't give

4066.079 --> 4070.079
it to them

4067.28 --> 4071.6800000000003
never never say something that's not

4070.079 --> 4075.52
perfectly correct

4071.68 --> 4078.0789999999997
they'll just start whining about it

4075.52 --> 4079.7599999999998
and then you have to be oh like after an

4078.079 --> 4082.0
hour you're going to complain

4079.76 --> 4084.079
why they just don't get it well maybe

4082.0 --> 4087.119
because you didn't say it right

4084.079 --> 4088.799
and then they use that they abuse your

4087.119 --> 4092.48
slight incorrection

4088.799 --> 4093.7599999999998
your incorrectness to basically waste an

4092.48 --> 4096.799
hour of your time

4093.76 --> 4098.719
after which you will feel oh i wasted

4096.799 --> 4101.199
like an hour of time with these people

4098.719 --> 4103.52
that are just whining about this

4101.199 --> 4104.799
right yeah guess what because you

4103.52 --> 4106.719
actually didn't

4104.799 --> 4108.48
perfectly think about it just because

4106.719 --> 4111.199
the earth is flat

4108.48 --> 4112.5599999999995
and you're winning in the argument flat

4111.199 --> 4115.04
versus ball

4112.56 --> 4117.679
doesn't mean you can't just say whatever

4115.04 --> 4121.04
and think it's some kind of a proof

4117.679 --> 4123.759
right that's just stupid that

4121.04 --> 4125.44
actually makes flat earthers look stupid

4123.759 --> 4128.159
don't do that

4125.44 --> 4128.96
not everything is proof the earth is

4128.159 --> 4131.839
flat

4128.96 --> 4133.199
right there is huge amounts of proof the

4131.839 --> 4135.199
earth is flat

4133.199 --> 4136.5599999999995
and not a sphere doesn't mean that

4135.199 --> 4139.919999999999
everything proves it

4136.56 --> 4144.2390000000005
to assume that makes you dumb

4139.92 --> 4146.56
do you understand don't do it

4144.239 --> 4147.919999999999
just because there's really dumb ballers

4146.56 --> 4151.839000000001
out there doesn't mean

4147.92 --> 4154.88
it's okay to be dumb too no it's not

4151.839 --> 4159.199
it's not okay don't do it

4154.88 --> 4162.719
don't make arguments that are flawed

4159.199 --> 4175.839
it just makes you look stupid

4162.719 --> 4175.839
don't do it

4186.799 --> 4189.6
yeah moth eyes

4189.92 --> 4194.0
sure ballers believe in the globe and

4191.839 --> 4196.719
they don't need to see curvature yeah

4194.0 --> 4198.56
they just need to think they see

4196.719 --> 4199.84
curvature and that's what it's always

4198.56 --> 4201.92
been

4199.84 --> 4203.4400000000005
nobody's ever seen earth curve and

4201.92 --> 4206.4800000000005
nobody ever

4203.44 --> 4207.12
they just were made to think it was

4206.48 --> 4210.239
earth curve

4207.12 --> 4213.36
by a mind experiment just imagine

4210.239 --> 4215.12
that horizon to be a sphere edge and oh

4213.36 --> 4216.639999999999
it doesn't actually abide by the real

4215.12 --> 4218.719
curvature well it's just

4216.64 --> 4220.4800000000005
optics and it's just the earth is too

4218.719 --> 4222.0
big or there's some mysterious

4220.48 --> 4225.919999999999
terrestrial refraction that

4222.0 --> 4229.52
unbends the curve of the earth right

4225.92 --> 4230.0
it's just all imagination nobody's ever

4229.52 --> 4232.88
seen earth

4230.0 --> 4233.92
girth because there is no earth curve

4232.88 --> 4238.2390000000005
they've been

4233.92 --> 4240.4
mind experimented into thinking it is

4238.239 --> 4242.08
by not thinking it too elaborately about

4240.4 --> 4244.48
it just make a quick

4242.08 --> 4245.44
false assumption and then rest

4244.48 --> 4248.4
everything you do

4245.44 --> 4248.96
on that that's how it works you just

4248.4 --> 4251.759999999999
assume

4248.96 --> 4252.4
quickly the horizon is the curve and

4251.76 --> 4255.84
it's too

4252.4 --> 4256.48
big and all that and maybe optics will

4255.84 --> 4259.52
get a little

4256.48 --> 4264.239
weird and bended around

4259.52 --> 4265.84
to in your mind make it into a sphere

4264.239 --> 4268.0
you don't have to confirm it you don't

4265.84 --> 4269.76
have to be good at geometry you don't

4268.0 --> 4273.28
have to understand optics

4269.76 --> 4275.1990000000005
to just do that see they're very easy a

4273.28 --> 4278.239
little kid can be made to do that to

4275.199 --> 4279.759999999999
imagine the earth to be a sphere because

4278.239 --> 4282.799999999999
you don't understand

4279.76 --> 4284.400000000001
the consequences of physical reality

4282.8 --> 4286.719
and understand that there is actually

4284.4 --> 4287.599999999999
geometrical consequences to standing on

4286.719 --> 4290.159
a sphere

4287.6 --> 4290.96
concerning the horizon and all that now

4290.159 --> 4294.0
people that are

4290.96 --> 4294.4
really really holding on to that earth

4294.0 --> 4296.239
ball

4294.4 --> 4297.839999999999
being is yeah the earth being a sphere

4296.239 --> 4300.718999999999
and all that

4297.84 --> 4301.360000000001
they might dig further into it and start

4300.719 --> 4303.76
making up

4301.36 --> 4304.48
excuses why it doesn't look like a

4303.76 --> 4307.04
sphere

4304.48 --> 4308.0
why the black swan sightings are made

4307.04 --> 4310.48
right and then they

4308.0 --> 4311.28
make up all this nonsense then when you

4310.48 --> 4313.04
dig into that

4311.28 --> 4315.04
like terrestrial fracture you figure out

4313.04 --> 4317.04
wait this is completely impossible

4315.04 --> 4318.8
it actually assumes a radius within the

4317.04 --> 4321.5199999999995
calculation

4318.8 --> 4322.8
and to suggest that there is an optical

4321.52 --> 4326.400000000001
effect that can

4322.8 --> 4329.4400000000005
unfold a spherical sighting

4326.4 --> 4332.08
into an apparent flat sighting

4329.44 --> 4334.48
that's really cute i'd like to see some

4332.08 --> 4338.159
actual demonstration of that

4334.48 --> 4342.5599999999995
give me that lens give me a lens

4338.159 --> 4347.28
right a lens that'll correct for that

4342.56 --> 4347.280000000001
yeah show me that lens

4348.48 --> 4352.799999999999
that'll that can make an actual

4350.32 --> 4356.159
spherical thing

4352.8 --> 4356.56
look perfectly flat into the horizon

4356.159 --> 4359.44
where

4356.56 --> 4361.76
until it disappears right show me an

4359.44 --> 4364.639999999999
optical medium that can achieve that

4361.76 --> 4365.92
yeah why don't you demonstrate that

4364.64 --> 4368.320000000001
right

4365.92 --> 4370.4800000000005
yeah i know things can be made to look

4368.32 --> 4371.92
like spheres that part is pretty easy

4370.48 --> 4373.36
just fish eye lens effect

4371.92 --> 4375.4400000000005
but why don't you try the other way

4373.36 --> 4378.159
around because that's what you suggest

4375.44 --> 4380.0
that terrestrial refraction is

4378.159 --> 4382.0
right things can be made to look

4380.0 --> 4382.96
spherical can it happen the other way

4382.0 --> 4385.92
around

4382.96 --> 4386.2390000000005
can you do that too can you make things

4385.92 --> 4388.719
that

4386.239 --> 4390.08
are confirmed spherical in some way or

4388.719 --> 4391.92
curve

4390.08 --> 4393.28
can you have some kind of optical thing

4391.92 --> 4395.76
that can

4393.28 --> 4396.32
make it look flat can you demonstrate

4395.76 --> 4399.12
that

4396.32 --> 4400.48
no you can't oh surprise surprise yeah

4399.12 --> 4402.08
do you know why

4400.48 --> 4404.32
because terrestrial refraction doesn't

4402.08 --> 4405.199
exist it's a mathematical fictional

4404.32 --> 4409.04
construct

4405.199 --> 4409.04
conjured up specifically

4409.28 --> 4415.199
as an excuse the horizon

4412.88 --> 4418.08
isn't where it's supposed to be if the

4415.199 --> 4418.08
earth was a sphere

4424.84 --> 4427.84
understand

4430.93 --> 4438.320000000001
[Music]

4434.719 --> 4440.08
yeah all right yeah

4438.32 --> 4442.5599999999995
good to hear you working out here we go

4440.08 --> 4445.6
again it's a i i love that trend

4442.56 --> 4447.84
it's good stuff good good job so yeah

4445.6 --> 4450.64
have fun with that

4447.84 --> 4450.64
i'll see you later

4452.159 --> 4460.799999999999
hey robert on 1960

4455.44 --> 4469.839999999999
bmr is that guns have never run rmp

4460.8 --> 4469.84
did you change your name

4471.52 --> 4474.400000000001
why'd you do that

4474.88 --> 4481.36
now everybody's gonna be all confused

4478.64 --> 4482.0
although i did kind of recognize you

4481.36 --> 4485.04
immediately

4482.0 --> 4487.84
also by the way you use the the smileys

4485.04 --> 4491.04
the emoticons everybody forgets it's

4487.84 --> 4497.84
called emoticon did you know that

4491.04 --> 4497.84
smiley it's an amati gun

4505.199 --> 4510.08
the irony of baltardia

4508.719 --> 4512.159
well there's supposed to be a lot of

4510.08 --> 4514.159
iron

4512.159 --> 4516.639999999999
as opposed to a lot of iron at the at

4514.159 --> 4520.719
the core of baltardia

4516.64 --> 4523.4400000000005
so i guess the irony is kind of thick

4520.719 --> 4524.159
pretty thick as it should basically be

4523.44 --> 4527.678999999999
the the

4524.159 --> 4527.679
multitude of volume

4529.6 --> 4534.64
on the earth understand like the molten

4532.8 --> 4537.76
iron core basically suggests

4534.64 --> 4540.719
that the multitude of material of the

4537.76 --> 4544.2390000000005
complete and total material of the earth

4540.719 --> 4549.44
on and in the multitude is molten iron

4544.239 --> 4553.839999999999
you understand the irony is taken deep

4549.44 --> 4553.839999999999
i'll be back two minutes

4634.84 --> 4637.84
so

4648.84 --> 4651.84
hey

4663.04 --> 4669.28
why would they lie because they can't

4666.0 --> 4672.08
well that's not really the reason what

4669.28 --> 4673.759999999999
they lied for more reasons than just

4672.08 --> 4677.28
because they can

4673.76 --> 4678.4800000000005
just because they can lie allows them to

4677.28 --> 4681.12
do it

4678.48 --> 4682.959999999999
why do they do it well there's very

4681.12 --> 4685.04
distinct reasons why they do it they do

4682.96 --> 4686.4800000000005
it to keep control

4685.04 --> 4688.88
because if you're in control of the

4686.48 --> 4692.08
information you know what's real

4688.88 --> 4695.36
and people that follow you or your idea

4692.08 --> 4696.8
don't know what's real then you got a

4695.36 --> 4699.759999999999
lot of control over

4696.8 --> 4700.719
where they will go where they will go in

4699.76 --> 4702.96
their minds

4700.719 --> 4704.4
and thus where they will go in the

4702.96 --> 4708.0
physical world

4704.4 --> 4710.239
so it's literal mind control if you

4708.0 --> 4712.32
are in the know of something and you

4710.239 --> 4713.678999999999
give false information that other people

4712.32 --> 4716.96
rely on

4713.679 --> 4720.159
then you literally have

4716.96 --> 4722.4
mind control

4720.159 --> 4722.4
see

4723.84 --> 4728.0
fundamental occultism hold back on the

4727.44 --> 4731.678999999999
truth

4728.0 --> 4734.48
present a false thing if you

4731.679 --> 4736.08
get everybody to believe it they take it

4734.48 --> 4738.959999999999
for granted then you

4736.08 --> 4741.28
have control over them because you do

4738.96 --> 4744.8
know what's real

4741.28 --> 4746.08
right and just satellite technology

4744.8 --> 4747.92
alone

4746.08 --> 4749.12
is one of the fruits of this mind

4747.92 --> 4751.12
control

4749.12 --> 4752.88
because if satellites would have been

4751.12 --> 4755.92
real it would have been a

4752.88 --> 4756.719
massively expensive exploit you would

4755.92 --> 4760.159
literally

4756.719 --> 4763.199
be hearing during financial crises

4760.159 --> 4765.12
of how satellite situations are

4763.199 --> 4767.28
cancelled and all that

4765.12 --> 4768.8
because it's just too [ __ ] expensive

4767.28 --> 4769.04
and people are going to complain about

4768.8 --> 4772.64
it

4769.04 --> 4775.92
it's too expensive right in reality

4772.64 --> 4776.320000000001
it's not expensive at all it's a giant

4775.92 --> 4779.76
pot

4776.32 --> 4781.36
of profits because it's suggested that

4779.76 --> 4782.64
all this stuff needs to happen like a

4781.36 --> 4784.239
rocket launch and a thing

4782.64 --> 4786.64
up there and has to be this and that and

4784.239 --> 4789.759999999999
this and that right super expensive

4786.64 --> 4791.52
reality it's not expensive at all it's

4789.76 --> 4792.159000000001
just a matter of flicking a freaking

4791.52 --> 4794.8
switch

4792.159 --> 4796.799999999999
on the radio tower done you got the

4794.8 --> 4799.360000000001
connection you got your satellite

4796.8 --> 4801.28
and you got a couple of millions of

4799.36 --> 4802.96
profit

4801.28 --> 4804.8
that literally you can put in your

4802.96 --> 4807.84
pocket because there's

4804.8 --> 4811.1990000000005
no expenses right that's why

4807.84 --> 4812.4800000000005
nobody ever complains during financial

4811.199 --> 4816.638999999999
crisis

4812.48 --> 4820.0
about satellites about their expenses

4816.639 --> 4823.04
nobody complains about it because there

4820.0 --> 4826.96
are no expenses it's

4823.04 --> 4827.92
[ __ ] cheap why because the earth is

4826.96 --> 4830.96
not a ball

4827.92 --> 4834.159
you don't need all those things

4830.96 --> 4835.52
to have satellite communication it's

4834.159 --> 4839.28
very cheap

4835.52 --> 4842.080000000001
right so yeah profit profit

4839.28 --> 4845.04
from mind control so there you go there

4842.08 --> 4845.04
you got your reasons

4845.12 --> 4851.84
mind control you control the destiny

4849.04 --> 4852.48
the world people what they're thinking

4851.84 --> 4854.8
and then

4852.48 --> 4857.599999999999
you can make very convenient little

4854.8 --> 4860.0
money schemes based on the fantasy

4857.6 --> 4861.280000000001
that they believe in it'll be very

4860.0 --> 4863.92
pricey and because

4861.28 --> 4865.84
yeah the conjured imagery and the story

4863.92 --> 4867.6
behind it people will believe that

4865.84 --> 4869.679
will be in all of it and be like wow

4867.6 --> 4872.320000000001
this is high technology wow yeah it has

4869.679 --> 4874.88
to be expensive no problem at all

4872.32 --> 4877.04
right they will have no objections to

4874.88 --> 4878.719
the giant expense that in physical

4877.04 --> 4882.239
reality are completely

4878.719 --> 4885.679
superfluous that's part of mind control

4882.239 --> 4888.5599999999995
mind control so yields profit

4885.679 --> 4890.0
a lot of it guess guess who did that in

4888.56 --> 4893.1990000000005
the past

4890.0 --> 4894.56
right and that the churches did that in

4893.199 --> 4896.799999999999
the past too

4894.56 --> 4898.719
because they were the arbiters of

4896.8 --> 4902.159000000001
miracles and the truth

4898.719 --> 4903.84
and of christ and god's will so if they

4902.159 --> 4907.28
freaking told you

4903.84 --> 4908.56
we need everybody in this village to

4907.28 --> 4912.159
work on this

4908.56 --> 4913.280000000001
for god that everybody would [ __ ] do

4912.159 --> 4914.719
it

4913.28 --> 4916.8
because if you were left out and

4914.719 --> 4918.639
everybody would be looking at you like

4916.8 --> 4920.4800000000005
what you're not gonna do it for god do

4918.639 --> 4923.76
you hate god or something are you

4920.48 --> 4925.12
like a witch right yeah that's also

4923.76 --> 4928.8
control

4925.12 --> 4930.5599999999995
and huge profits from that mind control

4928.8 --> 4932.8
because if you got a people mind

4930.56 --> 4936.400000000001
controlled into a certain belief

4932.8 --> 4939.76
then they will correct

4936.4 --> 4940.239
one another just like the ballers are

4939.76 --> 4944.320000000001
doing

4940.239 --> 4945.36
right now in chat they are the yeah the

4944.32 --> 4947.36
bonus

4945.36 --> 4949.199
the bonus of the mind control they are

4947.36 --> 4951.12
defending their mind control

4949.199 --> 4953.28
they are trying to reaffirm it into

4951.12 --> 4956.239
reality and trying to defend

4953.28 --> 4958.239
others from realizing it is mind control

4956.239 --> 4961.759999999999
from stepping out of it

4958.239 --> 4964.239
so people in mind control defend

4961.76 --> 4965.360000000001
their mind control they use peer

4964.239 --> 4969.839999999999
pressure to keep

4965.36 --> 4969.839999999999
others inside of that framework

4970.4 --> 4974.4
it's very profitable mind control is

4973.04 --> 4977.6
very profitable

4974.4 --> 4980.719
you see so yeah

4977.6 --> 4983.92
you are being profited off

4980.719 --> 4984.639
as a ball believer a lot a lot of

4983.92 --> 4988.4
profits

4984.639 --> 4988.400000000001
are being made from your beliefs

4988.48 --> 4991.759999999999
right but hey if your beliefs are worth

4991.44 --> 4994.879999999999
it

4991.76 --> 4994.88
if it's worth it to you

4994.96 --> 5001.84
go ahead

5012.84 --> 5015.84
hmm

5033.28 --> 5039.36
well morphite technically you don't need

5036.719 --> 5039.36
to travel

5040.84 --> 5044.96
beyond

5042.96 --> 5046.4800000000005
there's plenty of room still here on

5044.96 --> 5049.199
earth

5046.48 --> 5051.44
in the realm in the realm we know where

5049.199 --> 5055.04
you can do just that

5051.44 --> 5057.12
mind control of government is also in

5055.04 --> 5060.08
the minds

5057.12 --> 5061.04
government does not have as much control

5060.08 --> 5064.159
as you would

5061.04 --> 5067.5199999999995
like or as they would like

5064.159 --> 5068.32
a lot of it rides on bluff too so if you

5067.52 --> 5072.4800000000005
just

5068.32 --> 5075.5199999999995
start ignoring them and then like really

5072.48 --> 5078.799999999999
really ignoring them then they're not as

5075.52 --> 5081.92
much in your life as you would think

5078.8 --> 5083.52
now if you're using them if you're using

5081.92 --> 5084.96
their services think that

5083.52 --> 5087.120000000001
government is connected to that's

5084.96 --> 5090.8
another matter then you can't ignore it

5087.12 --> 5090.8
see that's how it works

5091.76 --> 5095.4400000000005
government has no control over you

5094.56 --> 5098.56
unless

5095.44 --> 5101.839999999999
you connect to it

5098.56 --> 5103.76
you see the amish know this

5101.84 --> 5106.0
they know it more than anybody in the

5103.76 --> 5106.0
world

5110.08 --> 5116.159
well maybe not anybody there might be

5111.76 --> 5116.159000000001
others but they definitely know it from

5124.84 --> 5129.749
experience

5126.59 --> 5129.749
[Music]

5143.76 --> 5147.04
okay i don't know what you're saying

5145.84 --> 5150.2390000000005
there

5147.04 --> 5155.84
what because that entire sentence is

5150.239 --> 5155.839999999999
complete self-esteed

5163.36 --> 5169.839999999999
i don't even know what you're saying

5194.96 --> 5199.36
yeah well in virtual reality and martha

5197.52 --> 5202.159000000001
is there is no infinite plane

5199.36 --> 5204.48
you get it no infinity there is no

5202.159 --> 5206.48
infinity in physical reality

5204.48 --> 5207.919999999999
it might be very big it might be bigger

5206.48 --> 5211.599999999999
there is no

5207.92 --> 5212.2390000000005
infinity in physical reality get that

5211.6 --> 5215.92
notion

5212.239 --> 5218.959999999999
out of your head get it out

5215.92 --> 5222.0
get it out there is no infinity in

5218.96 --> 5222.0
physical reality it's

5222.84 --> 5226.96
impossible

5224.0 --> 5226.96
can't be possible

5227.679 --> 5230.88
physics don't work that way there cannot

5230.4 --> 5234.32
be

5230.88 --> 5239.12
infinite volume infinite material

5234.32 --> 5241.12
infinite anything

5239.12 --> 5242.48
now i don't exactly know about the

5241.12 --> 5243.92
energy situation

5242.48 --> 5245.599999999999
i'm not going to make assumptions

5243.92 --> 5246.08
drawing in that because i don't fully

5245.6 --> 5249.4400000000005
understand

5246.08 --> 5251.76
even where it comes from like what is

5249.44 --> 5255.36
where's the solar energy coming from

5251.76 --> 5257.4400000000005
what is actually the source of that

5255.36 --> 5258.799999999999
i don't understand energy but what i do

5257.44 --> 5261.199
know there cannot be

5258.8 --> 5262.719
infinite volume and there cannot be

5261.199 --> 5267.839999999999
infinite amount of material

5262.719 --> 5267.84
it's just not possible

5291.76 --> 5295.280000000001
all right yeah so it's really cute keep

5294.0 --> 5298.0
fantasizing oh

5295.28 --> 5298.88
infinite oh so much more infinite

5298.0 --> 5303.6
exploration

5298.88 --> 5306.0
no there is no infinite space

5303.6 --> 5307.4400000000005
no infinite outer space no infinite

5306.0 --> 5310.08
inner space

5307.44 --> 5311.28
right no realm in space that is infinite

5310.08 --> 5315.04
that's not a physical

5311.28 --> 5323.84
option it's not a possibility can't be

5315.04 --> 5323.84
cannot be understand

5325.44 --> 5330.0
there can be a whole damned lot though

5327.6 --> 5332.400000000001
there can be more than you'll ever want

5330.0 --> 5334.56
right you could end up literally

5332.4 --> 5337.04
exploring and then figuring out at some

5334.56 --> 5339.679
point oh my god what have we done

5337.04 --> 5342.96
what the [ __ ] have we done why did we go

5339.679 --> 5345.28
this far why did we explore so much

5342.96 --> 5346.719
right who knows what the hell you're

5345.28 --> 5348.239
going to be bumping into when you

5346.719 --> 5350.159
explore that [ __ ]

5348.239 --> 5352.4
what you think humanity is the first

5350.159 --> 5357.44
time that they'll get there

5352.4 --> 5357.44
really i don't think so

5358.08 --> 5364.0
so yeah exploration is all really nice

5362.08 --> 5367.28
it's really satisfactory to that

5364.0 --> 5367.76
wonder lost inside right especially if

5367.28 --> 5370.32
you feel

5367.76 --> 5371.12
cramped in your own living conditions if

5370.32 --> 5374.48
you're

5371.12 --> 5377.12
being suppressed by the presence

5374.48 --> 5378.159
and vicinity of other people that are

5377.12 --> 5380.08
very competitive

5378.159 --> 5381.679
whatever yeah you want exploration you

5380.08 --> 5383.44
want to find that peace

5381.679 --> 5384.96
right you find that peace of mind it's

5383.44 --> 5387.5199999999995
wonder lost

5384.96 --> 5389.44
right well guess what you might find

5387.52 --> 5390.719
things you don't really want to find out

5389.44 --> 5394.5599999999995
there

5390.719 --> 5394.56
yeah why don't you think about that

5398.0 --> 5406.639
how about you just freaking fix

5401.44 --> 5421.839999999999
what's going on how about that

5406.639 --> 5421.84
how about you explore inward

5441.679 --> 5446.0
oh classic sci-fi films were propaganda

5444.56 --> 5449.4400000000005
no they were just sci-fi

5446.0 --> 5451.6
films and yes they did contain idea

5449.44 --> 5454.48
placement

5451.6 --> 5455.04
that were conjured up by the same people

5454.48 --> 5459.44
that

5455.04 --> 5461.199
chosen to reaffirm heliocentrism within

5459.44 --> 5463.839999999999
education

5461.199 --> 5463.839999999999
that's right

5465.92 --> 5471.36
does things like viruses and vaccination

5469.6 --> 5474.84
standards

5471.36 --> 5477.759999999999
vaccination as a medical standard

5474.84 --> 5480.8
and eugenics

5477.76 --> 5484.08
in general population control

5480.8 --> 5485.52
all those ideas have been inserted into

5484.08 --> 5488.719
early science fiction

5485.52 --> 5490.719
absolutely because they're they're

5488.719 --> 5494.2390000000005
coming from the same

5490.719 --> 5497.36
group of thinkers it's the same origin

5494.239 --> 5499.199
so they typically go hand in hand

5497.36 --> 5501.04
with outer space that's why it's a

5499.199 --> 5504.08
freaking much of it like

5501.04 --> 5506.08
tell me one goddamn space series or

5504.08 --> 5507.199
movie that does not have freaking

5506.08 --> 5509.92
viruses

5507.199 --> 5511.599999999999
and vaccines of some kind in it some

5509.92 --> 5514.4
injection medical

5511.6 --> 5516.56
and viruses that does not have some

5514.4 --> 5520.4
stupid population control

5516.56 --> 5522.719
subject somewhere right name me one

5520.4 --> 5523.679
god damn science fiction siri that

5522.719 --> 5528.4800000000005
doesn't have it

5523.679 --> 5528.4800000000005
and i'll be in awe i'll be in freaking

5530.84 --> 5536.08
off

5532.96 --> 5537.92
right and i can name one i can name one

5536.08 --> 5539.28
and how long would that have lasted

5537.92 --> 5541.6
right one

5539.28 --> 5544.08
series i know and that's firefly and

5541.6 --> 5546.320000000001
it's probably why they took it down

5544.08 --> 5547.6
because it didn't have all that [ __ ]

5546.32 --> 5550.719
in there

5547.6 --> 5553.4400000000005
it was just space as a medium just

5550.719 --> 5554.08
a medium and the rest it was pretty

5553.44 --> 5557.5199999999995
natural

5554.08 --> 5562.88
no freaking virus [ __ ]

5557.52 --> 5562.88
no population control issues [ __ ]

5564.239 --> 5569.759999999999
was much more about mind control

5568.0 --> 5572.32
and suppressing the little guy that was

5569.76 --> 5576.639
more the main theme of that series

5572.32 --> 5578.48
that's why it was discontinued blatantly

5576.639 --> 5580.32
and they didn't give up that reason

5578.48 --> 5589.839999999999
because people probably didn't even spot

5580.32 --> 5589.84
it too much back then

5592.32 --> 5597.5199999999995
oh why why patakon why does it seem

5595.199 --> 5602.96
crazy for anyone to subscribe

5597.52 --> 5606.320000000001
to fe why would that be crazy

5602.96 --> 5607.76
give me a good reason what's so crazy

5606.32 --> 5617.84
about subscribing to

5607.76 --> 5617.84
flat earth better

5621.6 --> 5625.360000000001
what do you mean lack of evidence

5626.639 --> 5630.0
so what lack of evidence what is this

5629.52 --> 5633.280000000001
lack of

5630.0 --> 5635.679
evidence you're talking about

5633.28 --> 5636.48
where do we fail to prove that the

5635.679 --> 5639.52
earth's

5636.48 --> 5642.799999999999
surface is geometrical flat

5639.52 --> 5644.8
where where do we fail in providing the

5642.8 --> 5647.04
evidence for this

5644.8 --> 5649.52
just seems like a blank assertion there

5647.04 --> 5649.5199999999995
patrick

5653.28 --> 5658.159
so yeah if if you mean lack of evidence

5656.08 --> 5660.8
then can you please point out where

5658.159 --> 5661.599999999999
exactly the lack of this evidence is

5660.8 --> 5664.88
where's this

5661.6 --> 5667.04
evidence that we need in order to prove

5664.88 --> 5668.32
that the surface of the earth is

5667.04 --> 5670.88
geometrically flat

5668.32 --> 5672.5599999999995
where exactly are we lacking in this

5670.88 --> 5675.76
evidence there

5672.56 --> 5678.320000000001
right or is this just another

5675.76 --> 5680.639
quickly quickly assert that it's it's no

5678.32 --> 5680.639
proof

5681.52 --> 5685.360000000001
is that it is that what you did or you

5684.56 --> 5688.159000000001
got some

5685.36 --> 5701.839999999999
actual supposed lack of evidence for the

5688.159 --> 5701.839999999999
earth being flat

5712.84 --> 5715.84
this

5719.84 --> 5726.159000000001
a working model

5722.88 --> 5727.4400000000005
what is a model what the [ __ ] are you

5726.159 --> 5730.32
blabbering about

5727.44 --> 5730.32
what model

5731.04 --> 5734.56
what we need to uphold some model

5733.6 --> 5737.84
against your

5734.56 --> 5740.96
absolutely destroyed globe model in

5737.84 --> 5744.159000000001
every freaking conceivable way

5740.96 --> 5746.56
physics mathematical philosophical

5744.159 --> 5747.92
every [ __ ] thing about the globe

5746.56 --> 5751.76
model is broken

5747.92 --> 5754.8
it's the most broken model humanity has

5751.76 --> 5758.320000000001
ever conceived why would the need to

5754.8 --> 5760.08
uphold another model

5758.32 --> 5762.159
what what is this obsession with

5760.08 --> 5764.0
freaking models

5762.159 --> 5765.759999999999
what's the use of a freaking model why

5764.0 --> 5770.32
do you need a model

5765.76 --> 5772.400000000001
to prove something it's ridiculous

5770.32 --> 5773.599999999999
how about we just figure out the earth

5772.4 --> 5776.719
is flat

5773.6 --> 5778.88
because there's no curvature you can see

5776.719 --> 5780.4
too far there's a black swan situation

5778.88 --> 5784.0
going on

5780.4 --> 5787.119
geometry would not allow such sites

5784.0 --> 5787.76
ever and there's no optic effects that

5787.119 --> 5791.36
can be

5787.76 --> 5794.320000000001
proven in physical reality to enable

5791.36 --> 5795.199
that on a sphere right even though you

5794.32 --> 5798.48
like to say

5795.199 --> 5799.119
it is right yeah so why would we need

5798.48 --> 5802.48
some kind of

5799.119 --> 5804.159
model to uphold versus your absolutely

5802.48 --> 5807.199
destroyed globe model

5804.159 --> 5808.5599999999995
the most broken model ever conceived by

5807.199 --> 5810.638999999999
mankind

5808.56 --> 5813.52
why would we need to uphold some kind of

5810.639 --> 5816.56
model for you

5813.52 --> 5816.56
what does it even mean

5818.4 --> 5823.599999999999
models make the world work no no it

5821.36 --> 5826.5599999999995
doesn't

5823.6 --> 5827.4800000000005
the world makes the world work models

5826.56 --> 5830.719
are just

5827.48 --> 5834.4
extrapolated systems to

5830.719 --> 5839.119
explain how it works

5834.4 --> 5843.28
right has nothing to do with anything

5839.119 --> 5843.28
a model doesn't prove anything

5846.639 --> 5855.84
all right okay robert

5856.719 --> 5859.84
i was just gonna ask for some support

5859.04 --> 5863.6
because i

5859.84 --> 5865.4400000000005
am getting into a financial tight spot

5863.6 --> 5867.679
even though my birthday is up in four

5865.44 --> 5871.678999999999
days

5867.679 --> 5871.679
typical happened last year too

5876.8 --> 5880.400000000001
there is no edge

5880.639 --> 5884.56
see here you go again with your false

5883.6 --> 5888.4800000000005
assumption

5884.56 --> 5890.96
you're conjuring up of a model

5888.48 --> 5893.04
right you're conjuring up a flat earth

5890.96 --> 5893.28
model in your mind because you're used

5893.04 --> 5896.88
to

5893.28 --> 5900.159
conjuring up a globe model in your mind

5896.88 --> 5901.1990000000005
and you assume you have to do that right

5900.159 --> 5903.44
you assume

5901.199 --> 5904.32
you have to conjure up a model so you're

5903.44 --> 5906.719
conjuring up

5904.32 --> 5908.639
a flat earth model see oh you're going

5906.719 --> 5909.679
over the edge oh yeah does anybody claim

5908.639 --> 5912.08
that here

5909.679 --> 5914.96
does anybody on cl in a flat earth claim

5912.08 --> 5918.0
you're going to fall over an edge

5914.96 --> 5920.2390000000005
yeah you dumbass

5918.0 --> 5922.08
have you ever heard a [ __ ] flat

5920.239 --> 5925.119
earther a real one

5922.08 --> 5927.36
ever in the last [ __ ] five years

5925.119 --> 5939.679
ever claimed you could fall over that

5927.36 --> 5942.08
you goddamn [ __ ]

5939.679 --> 5943.04
yeah laugh it up your goddamn retards

5942.08 --> 5945.84
that's you

5943.04 --> 5947.199
that's you you're the one that's [ __ ]

5945.84 --> 5949.6
[ __ ] enough

5947.199 --> 5951.759999999999
to think oh flat earth oh that means you

5949.6 --> 5953.1990000000005
fall over that you're a goddamn [ __ ]

5951.76 --> 5956.320000000001
you piece of [ __ ]

5953.199 --> 5960.719
get the [ __ ] out get

5956.32 --> 5963.759999999999
the [ __ ] out you goddamn [ __ ]

5960.719 --> 5966.0
with your stupid edges that nobody

5963.76 --> 5967.52
in flat earth claims we have a [ __ ]

5966.0 --> 5970.4
edge to fall off you

5967.52 --> 5970.400000000001
god damn idiot

5972.68 --> 5975.879
[Music]

5977.679 --> 5983.04
stop meddling with

5980.88 --> 5984.159000000001
the chat or i'm gonna take all of your

5983.04 --> 5988.8
wrenches away

5984.159 --> 5988.799999999999
i'm the one that bans people not you

5993.6 --> 5997.360000000001
there is no edge there is a continuous

5996.88 --> 6000.08
plane

5997.36 --> 6001.759999999999
and there may be a barrier at some point

6000.08 --> 6004.8
i personally don't think so

6001.76 --> 6007.4400000000005
i think it loops in on itself

6004.8 --> 6008.0
you literally move in a straight line

6007.44 --> 6010.08
arrive

6008.0 --> 6011.679
back at the same spot even though you

6010.08 --> 6014.48
moved geometrically

6011.679 --> 6015.6
perfectly in a straight line yeah good

6014.48 --> 6019.5199999999995
comparison would be

6015.6 --> 6021.84
the train man station from the matrix 2.

6019.52 --> 6023.4400000000005
matrix reloaded that's where they

6021.84 --> 6024.96
demonstrate there's been other places

6023.44 --> 6026.239
where it's demonstrated yeah that's what

6024.96 --> 6029.6
i think is going on

6026.239 --> 6033.44
there is no edge there is no edge

6029.6 --> 6035.679
it's a continual looping flat plane

6033.44 --> 6038.5599999999995
there is no edge

6035.679 --> 6040.08
there's nothing to fall off it's

6038.56 --> 6044.2390000000005
continual

6040.08 --> 6051.119
it's flat can move in a straight line

6044.239 --> 6054.04
eternally that's what i think

6051.119 --> 6055.199
why do you think it loops

6054.04 --> 6058.0
[Music]

6055.199 --> 6059.919999999999
what kind of a question is that if you

6058.0 --> 6061.76
can move in a straight line perfectly

6059.92 --> 6063.28
geometrically straight line for all

6061.76 --> 6066.719
eternity

6063.28 --> 6069.04
how could it be anything but looping

6066.719 --> 6071.119
ever thought about that oh here i go

6069.04 --> 6073.28
again no of course you [ __ ] didn't

6071.119 --> 6075.36
because you never think none of you ever

6073.28 --> 6077.119
think you just look at some stupid

6075.36 --> 6079.839999999999
little picture in your mind

6077.119 --> 6082.4
and then you just conclude israel that's

6079.84 --> 6085.119000000001
that's your extent of your reasoning

6082.4 --> 6085.759999999999
none of you ever think about how things

6085.119 --> 6089.719
work

6085.76 --> 6093.04
natural consequences actual mechanics

6089.719 --> 6095.679
realizations propositions

6093.04 --> 6096.4
of how you can test things nobody on the

6095.679 --> 6099.679
ball side

6096.4 --> 6102.0
ever thinks of this [ __ ] they're just

6099.679 --> 6104.4800000000005
trying to reaffirm their stupid little

6102.0 --> 6106.8
beliefs with their stupid trinkets

6104.48 --> 6108.799999999999
and then try to expand on the glory of

6106.8 --> 6111.92
the stupid little trinkets

6108.8 --> 6113.679
most of which aren't even real just

6111.92 --> 6115.6
conjured up concepts that are

6113.679 --> 6117.04
told to them they're real so they're

6115.6 --> 6118.4800000000005
working on their precious little

6117.04 --> 6120.48
satellites

6118.48 --> 6123.5199999999995
that are never going to be floating

6120.48 --> 6123.5199999999995
above earth ever

6124.719 --> 6132.08
yeah made up looping

6129.04 --> 6134.159
to fit my narrative well hey

6132.08 --> 6135.119
if you want to bump into a freaking edge

6134.159 --> 6137.5199999999995
or go

6135.119 --> 6139.36
over this geometry do you want to go

6137.52 --> 6140.88
over the geometrical curve yeah

6139.36 --> 6142.4
why don't you go ahead go over your

6140.88 --> 6144.96
geometrical curve

6142.4 --> 6147.599999999999
put a measuring stick to it yeah there

6144.96 --> 6150.159
is no curvature there is no curvature

6147.6 --> 6151.119000000001
you can see too far there's no optic

6150.159 --> 6154.638999999999
effects

6151.119 --> 6157.199
that can allow you to see that far

6154.639 --> 6158.56
over a curved surface that's a physical

6157.199 --> 6161.28
impossibility

6158.56 --> 6163.84
yeah cannot be demonstrated in physical

6161.28 --> 6163.84
reality

6164.32 --> 6169.119
so if you move in a straight line a

6167.44 --> 6170.4
geometrical straight line not a

6169.119 --> 6174.08
presupposed

6170.4 --> 6176.239
circle over a sphere literal straight

6174.08 --> 6179.28
line continually straight

6176.239 --> 6179.919999999999
yeah take a gyroscope to keep it

6179.28 --> 6181.92
straight

6179.92 --> 6183.76
right you move in that perfect straight

6181.92 --> 6184.96
line and if you end up in the same

6183.76 --> 6189.679
location

6184.96 --> 6192.56
well what else could it be but looping

6189.679 --> 6193.36
there's no other way to even fathom how

6192.56 --> 6196.080000000001
that could be

6193.36 --> 6197.44
other than if there's like a portal like

6196.08 --> 6200.8
spatial loop

6197.44 --> 6204.08
happening there is no other alternative

6200.8 --> 6206.96
you can't think of anything else

6204.08 --> 6208.4
if you can i'd like to hear about it

6206.96 --> 6210.56
yeah

6208.4 --> 6211.759999999999
perfect straight line perfect

6210.56 --> 6214.96
geometrical

6211.76 --> 6217.679
no alteration no no going over

6214.96 --> 6218.159
anything perfect straight line forever

6217.679 --> 6221.52
yeah

6218.159 --> 6223.44
how can you mechanically explain this in

6221.52 --> 6233.84
any sort of way other than

6223.44 --> 6233.839999999999
that space is looping please tell me

6236.719 --> 6245.52
my looping is not an explanation

6240.32 --> 6248.4
for flat earth it's not an explanation

6245.52 --> 6251.119000000001
a loop doesn't prove the earth is flat

6248.4 --> 6253.759999999999
it's just a potential possibility that

6251.119 --> 6253.759999999999
can happen

6254.08 --> 6259.36
can turn out to be like that right

6257.36 --> 6260.88
there's not going to be an edge though

6259.36 --> 6263.839999999999
if anything

6260.88 --> 6265.1990000000005
anybody that does not agree to that it

6263.84 --> 6267.28
might be possible that there is a

6265.199 --> 6268.96
spatial loop going on in the realm

6267.28 --> 6270.639
well they'll just say there's a [ __ ]

6268.96 --> 6271.92
barrier yeah there will be there will be

6270.639 --> 6274.4800000000005
a barrier

6271.92 --> 6276.159
right over there oh you can't see it

6274.48 --> 6278.239
yeah it's because the freaking air is in

6276.159 --> 6282.159
the way it's right over there

6278.239 --> 6284.4
yeah why don't you go over there and

6282.159 --> 6286.239
this proof it's there

6284.4 --> 6289.199
why don't you go ahead prove us there's

6286.239 --> 6292.0
no freaking dome prove it

6289.199 --> 6292.0
move through it

6301.6 --> 6305.4400000000005
is there any evidence for a barrier well

6303.84 --> 6307.92
yeah yeah there is

6305.44 --> 6308.719
you know what it is where have gas

6307.92 --> 6310.32
pressure

6308.719 --> 6312.4800000000005
so there must be containment of some

6310.32 --> 6314.5599999999995
kind that means

6312.48 --> 6315.678999999999
containing physical containment right

6314.56 --> 6318.96
means a barrier

6315.679 --> 6321.6
some kind so unless there is a loop

6318.96 --> 6322.639
which takes away partial necessity of

6321.6 --> 6325.84
barrier because

6322.639 --> 6328.159000000001
gas can simply be pushing against itself

6325.84 --> 6331.1990000000005
within the contained looping realm

6328.159 --> 6334.799999999999
right but there would have to be

6331.199 --> 6334.799999999999
barriers at some point

6335.199 --> 6341.28
has to be there cannot be

6338.239 --> 6343.44
gas pressure without containment and

6341.28 --> 6345.759999999999
containment would naturally be assumed

6343.44 --> 6349.04
to be barriers of some kind

6345.76 --> 6349.679
now a spatial loop may potentially take

6349.04 --> 6352.32
away

6349.679 --> 6353.28
some necessity of barriers in a certain

6352.32 --> 6355.84
aspect

6353.28 --> 6356.4
there always will be some barriers to

6355.84 --> 6359.52
contain

6356.4 --> 6361.36
the non-looping elements of the realm if

6359.52 --> 6364.0
the realm was looping

6361.36 --> 6365.5199999999995
right so there has to be a barrier then

6364.0 --> 6368.239
so it's either looping

6365.52 --> 6370.0
or it's a barrier there's gas pressure

6368.239 --> 6372.879999999999
so there has to be containment

6370.0 --> 6374.719
which means physical containment right

6372.88 --> 6377.04
has to be a limited amount of space with

6374.719 --> 6379.92
nowhere for the gas to escape towards

6377.04 --> 6379.92
outside of it

6381.28 --> 6384.88
has to be because we're breathing it's

6383.199 --> 6387.04
here right now

6384.88 --> 6388.159000000001
these are the options available there's

6387.04 --> 6390.32
no other

6388.159 --> 6393.28
you could potentially think of one i'd

6390.32 --> 6393.28
like to hear about it

6393.44 --> 6396.5599999999995
because these are the options that i've

6395.28 --> 6400.08
been able to think up

6396.56 --> 6403.6
in freaking five years

6400.08 --> 6406.08
actually i i technically thought them up

6403.6 --> 6408.400000000001
before i even got on youtube that's why

6406.08 --> 6410.719
my very very first hangout

6408.4 --> 6413.04
had all these model concepts in them

6410.719 --> 6415.119
right at the first show

6413.04 --> 6416.88
because i had been thinking about it in

6415.119 --> 6420.0
the back of my mind and my subconscious

6416.88 --> 6424.159000000001
one could say for my entire life

6420.0 --> 6424.159
but purely subconsciously

6427.04 --> 6431.04
no barry has been observed well that's

6430.0 --> 6434.159
been disputable

6431.04 --> 6436.48
that's disputed

6434.159 --> 6437.44
you you can't say that no barrier has

6436.48 --> 6441.04
ever been

6437.44 --> 6444.159
observed you don't know that

6441.04 --> 6444.8
ah yeah sorry about it you don't know if

6444.159 --> 6447.839999999999
that's

6444.8 --> 6450.96
true though you don't have

6447.84 --> 6453.76
the ability to get in people's heads

6450.96 --> 6455.199
maybe in the past and then say no

6453.76 --> 6458.2390000000005
nobody's ever

6455.199 --> 6461.199
observed it you don't know that

6458.239 --> 6463.28
and hey maybe people observed and then

6461.199 --> 6467.119
as part of a conspiracy

6463.28 --> 6468.0
kept it secret right it's a big chance

6467.119 --> 6471.839999999999
that

6468.0 --> 6471.84
what's his name again

6473.119 --> 6475.5199999999995
damn it

6476.96 --> 6483.44
that admiral bird actually

6480.0 --> 6488.0
found and even touched the barrier

6483.44 --> 6488.0
he just never called it the barrier

6493.04 --> 6497.199
whoever is the baby ever yeah howard

6495.52 --> 6498.159000000001
moore if you're going to repeat that one

6497.199 --> 6500.239
more time i will

6498.159 --> 6502.48
ban you if you're just gonna say no

6500.239 --> 6505.199
evidence of burial evidence of barrier

6502.48 --> 6508.08
yeah well in the looping realm we don't

6505.199 --> 6508.08
need a barrier

6508.239 --> 6514.718999999999
so you don't have to bump into a barrier

6511.44 --> 6517.04
on a flat earth it's not a necessity

6514.719 --> 6519.52
yeah you get it no necessity for a

6517.04 --> 6519.5199999999995
barrier

6520.32 --> 6526.639
at least not in a horizontal sense

6524.8 --> 6529.28
as long as the air is contained there's

6526.639 --> 6533.28
nowhere to go

6529.28 --> 6535.599999999999
physically by being sealed off

6533.28 --> 6539.5199999999995
within the realm then there doesn't need

6535.6 --> 6541.4400000000005
to be any barrier in a horizontal sense

6539.52 --> 6542.56
considerate might be wrong well when it

6541.44 --> 6545.04
comes to flat earth

6542.56 --> 6545.92
absolutely i considered that i might be

6545.04 --> 6548.32
wrong yeah yeah

6545.92 --> 6549.679
except the earth is absolutely [ __ ]

6548.32 --> 6553.679
flat not a globe

6549.679 --> 6558.0
and if it were we would all be dead

6553.679 --> 6560.4800000000005
all be dead all your mechanics

6558.0 --> 6561.599
that are tied into explaining how the

6560.48 --> 6564.08
globe works

6561.599 --> 6564.639
would literally mean everybody would be

6564.08 --> 6567.119
dead

6564.639 --> 6568.159000000001
would never been born nothing could

6567.119 --> 6570.5599999999995
exist

6568.159 --> 6572.96
on the globe nothing can exist on your

6570.56 --> 6576.639
globe model it is the dumbest

6572.96 --> 6583.84
most incomplete broken model humanity

6576.639 --> 6583.84
has ever conceived you [ __ ] [ __ ]

6595.76 --> 6599.4890000000005
[Music]

6611.04 --> 6615.5199999999995
yeah feeling extra banned today [ __ ] off

6614.56 --> 6617.92
nobody gives a

6615.52 --> 6620.400000000001
[ __ ] what you have to say about my mood

6617.92 --> 6623.1990000000005
you goddamn piece of [ __ ]

6620.4 --> 6624.08
bobby steals you [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]

6623.199 --> 6627.5199999999995
[ __ ] troll

6624.08 --> 6630.84
pieces [ __ ] [ __ ] off a regular

6627.52 --> 6634.0
fed chatrol scumbag that's what you are

6630.84 --> 6637.52
disgusting scumbag she's like

6634.0 --> 6639.92
oh oh i am so so civilized

6637.52 --> 6640.639
because i'm a glober and i'm going to

6639.92 --> 6642.4800000000005
wait

6640.639 --> 6644.32
maybe poke at a bunch of flat earthers

6642.48 --> 6646.32
until they get frustrated and then be

6644.32 --> 6648.799999999999
all high and mighty like oh

6646.32 --> 6649.759999999999
oh the flat earth is always seem a

6648.8 --> 6652.0
little

6649.76 --> 6653.8
little uncivilized how could that be

6652.0 --> 6655.36
maybe because it's you're a [ __ ]

6653.8 --> 6658.2390000000005
scumbag

6655.36 --> 6659.04
that constantly whines at people making

6658.239 --> 6662.32
their lives

6659.04 --> 6663.84
miserable with your [ __ ] and then

6662.32 --> 6667.119
being all high and mighty

6663.84 --> 6670.8
when they actually react frustrated yeah

6667.119 --> 6670.799999999999
bobby steals just scumbag

6671.84 --> 6683.92
what do you think that happens

6680.96 --> 6685.84
[ __ ] you [ __ ] you bobby steals go

6683.92 --> 6687.1990000000005
[ __ ] kill yourself you [ __ ]

6685.84 --> 6689.76
scumbag

6687.199 --> 6690.96
jump in front of a bus get over your

6689.76 --> 6693.119000000001
balcony

6690.96 --> 6695.04
[ __ ] rip a knife in your throat

6693.119 --> 6698.08
whatever the [ __ ] you do get the [ __ ]

6695.04 --> 6701.119
out you [ __ ] scumbag

6698.08 --> 6702.0
[ __ ] off why don't you make your own

6701.119 --> 6709.839999999999
family's life

6702.0 --> 6709.84
miserable you piece of [ __ ]

6716.56 --> 6722.320000000001
i give a [ __ ] what you do you piece of

6720.84 --> 6724.719
[ __ ]

6722.32 --> 6726.5599999999995
you're wasting my goddamn time i'm

6724.719 --> 6727.28
talking about flat earth here and all

6726.56 --> 6730.719
you do is

6727.28 --> 6733.5199999999995
whine like a [ __ ] in my chat

6730.719 --> 6734.88
your stupid little model you keep

6733.52 --> 6738.56
researching like oh oh

6734.88 --> 6741.28
you flat earth it's not it's disproven

6738.56 --> 6743.52
yeah yeah oh so your [ __ ] globe your

6741.28 --> 6745.44
[ __ ] [ __ ] little globe

6743.52 --> 6746.56
is now real right even though it's the

6745.44 --> 6750.32
most broken

6746.56 --> 6753.84
model humanity has ever conceived

6750.32 --> 6755.92
in human history yeah no nothing

6753.84 --> 6758.0
is going to make your globe real you

6755.92 --> 6761.679
goddamn [ __ ]

6758.0 --> 6764.719
nothing it's not real it never

6761.679 --> 6767.76
will be real no amount of

6764.719 --> 6768.8
freaking indoctrination will ever make

6767.76 --> 6771.84
the globe real

6768.8 --> 6773.119000000001
the only place it can ever be real is in

6771.84 --> 6776.2390000000005
your minds

6773.119 --> 6779.119
where satan tells you it is [ __ ]

6776.239 --> 6779.598999999999
real no matter what that's where it's

6779.119 --> 6782.719
real

6779.599 --> 6793.84
it's the only [ __ ] place it's real

6782.719 --> 6793.84
in your lying god damned mine

6796.66 --> 6799.8
[Music]

6802.95 --> 6807.84
[Music]

6804.84 --> 6807.84
um

6808.08 --> 6813.44
ah you see this is this is why i don't

6811.599 --> 6817.4400000000005
do this [ __ ] anymore

6813.44 --> 6820.719
it's just i try to be

6817.44 --> 6822.48
just good and all that and then

6820.719 --> 6824.159
i start to get real again with flat
