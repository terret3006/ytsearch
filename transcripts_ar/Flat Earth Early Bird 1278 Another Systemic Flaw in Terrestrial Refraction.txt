anyway yeah the weather has turned

130.08 --> 134.87900000000002
around

131.599 --> 134.879
pretty dramatically

135.76 --> 140.56
and i did kind of predict that

137.92 --> 140.55999999999997
yesterday

141.68 --> 145.44
so the amount they were spraying and

143.84 --> 146.959
just they kept them

145.44 --> 149.76
compounding it

146.959 --> 151.24
well yeah it started like raining

149.76 --> 153.51899999999998
in the night

151.24 --> 156.08
[Music]

153.519 --> 158.239
and yeah that went on until the morning

156.08 --> 161.92000000000002
and it's just really clouded right now

158.239 --> 161.92000000000002
it's it cool off a lot

165.44 --> 170.4
and yeah the the plants are certainly

167.519 --> 172.31900000000002
happy

170.4 --> 174.4
i think that a lot of

172.319 --> 178.23899999999998
the fauna is also

174.4 --> 178.239
kind of happy that it cooled off a bit

180.63 --> 186.56
[Music]

182.319 --> 188.72
hello john 925 first in chat good to see

186.56 --> 188.72
you

190.959 --> 196.599
it is sunday the 19th of june 2022

206.159 --> 211.599
right oh and by the way

209.2 --> 214.07999999999998
mentioned yesterday like oh

211.599 --> 216.0
i like when it suddenly cools down i

214.08 --> 218.64000000000001
feel it in like the

216.0 --> 221.44
stuff on my bones right

218.64 --> 224.07999999999998
but then i realized like wait no that

221.44 --> 226.239
that's actually when it

224.08 --> 228.4
cools down more like when it actually

226.239 --> 232.08
gets to freezing point

228.4 --> 232.08
not when it cools down like this

233.12 --> 237.28
right

234.08 --> 240.0
so just like in retrospect i did watch

237.28 --> 242.72
back my show yesterday

240.0 --> 244.799
from beginning to end

242.72 --> 247.2
it was interesting

244.799 --> 248.48000000000002
bit intense

247.2 --> 251.439
and i think that

248.48 --> 254.72
certain people

251.439 --> 256.71999999999997
well remember that nerdy ee guy that i

254.72 --> 259.16
talked to over skype well apparently he

256.72 --> 261.759
was really

259.16 --> 264.88000000000005
outraged by some things that i said

261.759 --> 264.88
there and he blocked me

266.0 --> 270.8
wasn't all too clear exactly why

269.04 --> 274.24
it had to do with like

270.8 --> 277.52000000000004
things i said about boomers and

274.24 --> 280.24
he was one apparently and

277.52 --> 283.44
i'm just evil now

280.24 --> 286.32
right even though i thought that i was

283.44 --> 286.9
like not aiming at like all boomers or

286.32 --> 289.12
anything but

286.9 --> 290.88
[Music]

289.12 --> 293.919
right now when they say boomer it's

290.88 --> 297.35
usually a bit over generalized anyway

293.919 --> 298.96
it's more like slang boomer

297.35 --> 300.47900000000004
[Music]

298.96 --> 302.71999999999997
right

300.479 --> 305.919
anyway

302.72 --> 308.24
yesterday also ball buster's live i did

305.919 --> 311.919
get on it

308.24 --> 315.44
was not super active or anything but

311.919 --> 318.15999999999997
did have a couple of moments

315.44 --> 320.88
where i piped up

318.16 --> 323.12
and that was overall yeah it was pretty

320.88 --> 325.199
much more

323.12 --> 327.44
of the same

325.199 --> 330.32
but it's good to go through that on that

327.44 --> 330.32
detailed level

336.32 --> 340.56
right also been watching more own

337.919 --> 340.56
benjamin

343.039 --> 347.28
some pretty intense things here and

344.96 --> 347.28
there

351.6 --> 357.12
yeah the problem is when i watch owen

353.52 --> 359.84
benjamin like especially multiple shows

357.12 --> 362.24
it does kind of blend into a super bit

359.84 --> 362.23999999999995
to me

362.8 --> 366.12
hey mexico

370.0 --> 373.84
all right no one else uh

374.8 --> 380.72
yeah john thor

377.6 --> 382.639
had a video this morning

380.72 --> 384.88000000000005
pretty cool stuff

382.639 --> 386.72
it's like footage

384.88 --> 389.52
basically a high altitude balloon with

386.72 --> 390.88000000000005
the 360 camera

389.52 --> 394.68
was pretty cool

390.88 --> 394.68
so check that out

407.12 --> 410.4
what else what else

410.479 --> 414.68
i think it was pretty much it

449.52 --> 453.44
anyway i had another walk this morning

451.599 --> 455.28
like i'm getting like

453.44 --> 458.479
i think that just taking a walk is

455.28 --> 462.0
really the solution to like

458.479 --> 463.12
me weirdly getting unwell

462.0 --> 465.199
around

463.12 --> 466.8
before i start the show which i don't

465.199 --> 468.83
know with this heat it just seems to

466.8 --> 472.019
happen more

468.83 --> 472.019
[Music]

474.16 --> 479.59900000000005
but yeah getting walk

476.639 --> 480.879
out there because like it did cool off

479.599 --> 482.479
pretty

480.879 --> 485.44
dramatically let's see what's the

482.479 --> 485.44
temperature right now

487.68 --> 491.639
yeah it's 17 degrees

493.199 --> 499.759
according to the predictions

496.0 --> 499.759
tuesday it's going to get warm again

500.56 --> 504.96
so it's probably going to be a bit rainy

502.319 --> 504.96000000000004
this weekend

505.599 --> 509.319
or well this sunday

520.32 --> 522.5600000000001
right

521.279 --> 525.76
but anyway

522.56 --> 525.76
in a walk and

526.08 --> 529.12
it's funny because

533.04 --> 538.7199999999999
it's like there's some people with dogs

536.959 --> 541.04
and it's just that

538.72 --> 544.8000000000001
dogs for me are like

541.04 --> 546.8389999999999
the ultimate welcoming card almost

544.8 --> 549.68
like unless they're like

546.839 --> 551.12
like shriveled up little dogs which are

549.68 --> 552.4799999999999
like

551.12 --> 554.399
yeah

552.48 --> 556.24
they don't tend to like me but they tend

554.399 --> 557.6
to like know what he

556.24 --> 559.36
actually

557.6 --> 560.9590000000001
but like especially like some of the

559.36 --> 563.12
bigger dogs

560.959 --> 565.8389999999999
and a lot of them are just so loving and

563.12 --> 568.48
they can like see right through you

565.839 --> 570.48
so when i then go and walk walk do the

568.48 --> 572.64
walk and i'm like

570.48 --> 575.44
boring

572.64 --> 577.76
feeling a bit uneasy maybe like

575.44 --> 580.32
maybe almost a little bit depressed but

577.76 --> 582.0
just internally

580.32 --> 584.24
just

582.0 --> 586.08
it happens regularly

584.24 --> 588.16
like i've had that pretty much all my

586.08 --> 590.8000000000001
life can't really get rid of it it's

588.16 --> 592.959
just like how do you minimalize that

590.8 --> 596.24
but it always does come back a bit like

592.959 --> 598.56
a reminder and like some dogs just see

596.24 --> 599.6
that and they just like oh come here

598.56 --> 601.1199999999999
just have a

599.6 --> 604.8000000000001
have a hug

601.12 --> 606.399
and like it is so amazing every time

604.8 --> 607.68
that happens and this time there was

606.399 --> 610.72
like this couple

607.68 --> 610.7199999999999
they had two dogs

611.44 --> 614.8800000000001
a bit bulldog looking like

613.839 --> 616.8800000000001
pretty

614.88 --> 618.64
sturdy big head

616.88 --> 620.16
and it was such a loving creature and

618.64 --> 622.48
like gave me a hug and all that and

620.16 --> 624.399
licked my hand and

622.48 --> 628.399
that like really

624.399 --> 630.64
brightened my mood this is a lot

628.399 --> 630.64
yeah

631.04 --> 634.7199999999999
i i wouldn't personally actually want to

633.2 --> 638.72
have a dog

634.72 --> 638.72
but like dogs are great

639.76 --> 645.04
like they yeah

642.24 --> 646.88
i do like a lot of dogs

645.04 --> 647.56
it's great to have people with dogs

646.88 --> 650.67
around

647.56 --> 650.67
[Music]

651.68 --> 656.3199999999999
and for me it's like a really good

654.399 --> 658.64
excuse also to basically start a

656.32 --> 661.279
conversation

658.64 --> 662.88
because starting conversation for me can

661.279 --> 664.88
be kind of difficult

662.88 --> 666.399
if a dog's like all welcoming and

664.88 --> 670.56
hugging you like

666.399 --> 672.399
a conversation usually just starts

670.56 --> 674.3199999999999
from the owner or

672.399 --> 676.48
like start talking about the dog and

674.32 --> 679.9200000000001
then just move on to

676.48 --> 679.9200000000001
what else yeah whatever

683.839 --> 687.9590000000001
so that yeah that's always nice

695.2 --> 698.88
right so

696.56 --> 698.88
guys

701.12 --> 705.839
what are you up to

702.8 --> 707.8389999999999
has it like cooled down a lot over there

705.839 --> 709.6
where you are at or is it just here the

707.839 --> 713.0790000000001
netherlands

709.6 --> 713.0790000000001
you tell me

728.0 --> 733.44
also has anybody actually checked out my

730.519 --> 735.92
symbolics.nl site

733.44 --> 739.2
it's weird

735.92 --> 739.1999999999999
it's kind of complex

740.0 --> 742.48
it's not

743.2 --> 746.9590000000001
because i kind of like to talk about it

747.76 --> 752.16
but you'd actually have to read it and

749.92 --> 753.92
like feel like you want to make notes

752.16 --> 757.68
and all that because

753.92 --> 760.399
it is all written in like a very

757.68 --> 763.519
pre-christian

760.399 --> 765.04
it was written in a time when i still

763.519 --> 767.04
had like

765.04 --> 769.76
christ allergies

767.04 --> 771.279
so i like specifically avoided that

769.76 --> 774.399
basically when in sort of an

771.279 --> 775.4399999999999
oppositional defiance position

774.399 --> 777.92
with

775.44 --> 780.8000000000001
well in retrospect like with the naming

777.92 --> 782.0
of these elements

780.8 --> 784.639
but

782.0 --> 786.72
then there's this structure that i put

784.639 --> 789.6
down with it so you could almost like

786.72 --> 792.24
replace certain types of words with

789.6 --> 793.519
another type of word

792.24 --> 796.9590000000001
and then

793.519 --> 796.9590000000001
it works really well

799.12 --> 801.839
right

802.48 --> 806.72
or it could and anyway i'd like to talk

804.959 --> 809.1199999999999
about it i don't know if anybody's

806.72 --> 813.88
actually read it and

809.12 --> 813.88
they just got confused from it

814.13 --> 817.179
[Music]

818.56 --> 824.16
dude i've i've let people read it in the

821.36 --> 826.32
past quite a few times because even then

824.16 --> 827.199
it was like whoa what did i just write

826.32 --> 828.5600000000001
down

827.199 --> 830.24
and i'm like

828.56 --> 832.8
can you read this what do you think

830.24 --> 832.8
about this

833.519 --> 838.639
but back then i had a lot of like

835.92 --> 843.199
nervous responses to it

838.639 --> 845.92
what about cows what the hell

843.199 --> 845.92
what about him

853.92 --> 857.8389999999999
kai from gore

858.13 --> 867.82
[Music]

874.079 --> 879.16
third fourth coming

875.6 --> 879.16
seeking star wars

882.56 --> 885.56
ah

886.0 --> 890.24
i forgot to read like

887.839 --> 891.0400000000001
the castanada book i still have the link

890.24 --> 894.16
though

891.04 --> 896.15
i did save it but i forgot it again

894.16 --> 898.079
this always happens

896.15 --> 899.76
[Music]

898.079 --> 903.959
am gonna read it

899.76 --> 903.959
or some of it at least

919.519 --> 923.36
her boob is wearing out

924.079 --> 930.3199999999999
what the [ __ ] well look

928.079 --> 931.519
okay from you're probably trolling right

930.32 --> 934.5600000000001
now

931.519 --> 936.48
but in my typical armenian fashion i'm

934.56 --> 938.8389999999999
gonna pretend like that's actually a

936.48 --> 941.759
serious question which it is probably

938.839 --> 943.2790000000001
not you have a cow

941.759 --> 945.36
and they stop

943.279 --> 947.12
moving and expressing themselves it

945.36 --> 949.44
could be that they're feeling really

947.12 --> 951.44
lonely i mean if it's like oh

949.44 --> 954.24
it's just that cow

951.44 --> 956.24
no other cows or no other types of

954.24 --> 958.24
animals

956.24 --> 960.5600000000001
that they connect with

958.24 --> 962.72
then yeah they can get depressed and

960.56 --> 965.279
basically lose their

962.72 --> 968.279
have their moo wear it out as you so

965.279 --> 968.279
silly

969.12 --> 971.839
so there you go

975.68 --> 981.12
symbolics with tarot some what

979.279 --> 983.759
uh

981.12 --> 986.5600000000001
derpcon point five

983.759 --> 988.72
well see sure like yeah we we were still

986.56 --> 991.279
gonna do a show right

988.72 --> 991.279
yeah sure

991.68 --> 996.7199999999999
we could also bring up symbolics.now

994.24 --> 999.519
it's just that

996.72 --> 1001.9200000000001
i want people's questions about it and

999.519 --> 1005.279
like concerns and like

1001.92 --> 1005.279
where you think like hey this

1005.6 --> 1009.6
seems like you were onto something but

1007.759 --> 1013.519
then you made a mistake and this is the

1009.6 --> 1013.519
mistake right analysis

1018.8 --> 1023.8389999999999
right but you still got to realize that

1021.279 --> 1026.64
it is a pretty old text and

1023.839 --> 1028.64
technically i should

1026.64 --> 1031.76
probably like

1028.64 --> 1033.439
rewrite a lot of it and expand on it

1031.76 --> 1036.48
basically

1033.439 --> 1037.52
reforge the old structure and then just

1036.48 --> 1042.559
like

1037.52 --> 1042.559
give a more refined naming to the things

1042.64 --> 1047.679
and maybe maybe then people will like

1045.12 --> 1050.08
pay attention or something i don't know

1047.679 --> 1053.4
what it is but this thing has been out

1050.08 --> 1053.3999999999999
there for

1054.16 --> 1058.3200000000002
12 years

1056.08 --> 1058.32
more

1058.72 --> 1064.32
2006

1061.679 --> 1067.44
no 16 years yeah

1064.32 --> 1068.96
it's always been there

1067.44 --> 1071.2
i even had like

1068.96 --> 1073.44
little business cards

1071.2 --> 1075.919
for it

1073.44 --> 1078.559
because it was also kind of functioning

1075.919 --> 1081.3600000000001
as like oh this is also for goldsmithing

1078.559 --> 1083.52
advertisement right can you imagine the

1081.36 --> 1085.28
symbolics that i know was actually a

1083.52 --> 1086.6399999999999
goldsmithing

1085.28 --> 1088.96
website

1086.64 --> 1091.679
i just kind of

1088.96 --> 1094.64
put all my theories on there as well

1091.679 --> 1098.4
because it was like yeah i'm a

1094.64 --> 1100.0
magical goldsmith i can make enchanted

1098.4 --> 1102.5590000000002
jewelry

1100.0 --> 1103.84
very unapologetic about that i look i've

1102.559 --> 1107.24
always been

1103.84 --> 1107.24
very unapologetic

1107.679 --> 1113.919
about the way i put down things

1111.36 --> 1116.08
just like yeah i do magic

1113.919 --> 1118.7990000000002
oh oh oh

1116.08 --> 1120.6399999999999
you don't like that or oh it's blasphemy

1118.799 --> 1122.559
oh okay

1120.64 --> 1125.3600000000001
well you don't really understand what it

1122.559 --> 1127.84
is anyway and yeah these things happen

1125.36 --> 1130.24
i just happen to be aware of how it

1127.84 --> 1130.24
works

1130.64 --> 1133.96
that's all

1137.2 --> 1141.76
you need to read it more thoroughly

1139.919 --> 1144.0800000000002
right

1141.76 --> 1145.52
well not everything about it is great

1144.08 --> 1148.08
though

1145.52 --> 1151.52
but the most important points are there

1148.08 --> 1153.6789999999999
and it is really when i don't pad

1151.52 --> 1155.6
the story like with the

1153.679 --> 1158.3200000000002
the pattern right which is kind of the

1155.6 --> 1158.32
core effect

1158.88 --> 1165.2800000000002
it was weird by the way because like

1162.08 --> 1168.24
benjamin had this jewish guy on

1165.28 --> 1169.9189999999999
who was also talking about the pattern

1168.24 --> 1173.679
and it's like dude

1169.919 --> 1175.679
did you just steal my idea from 16 years

1173.679 --> 1178.96
ago

1175.679 --> 1181.6000000000001
that it's ridiculous because i

1178.96 --> 1183.44
i think that the idea of the pattern had

1181.6 --> 1186.32
been around already for a while i might

1183.44 --> 1187.679
have actually got it from the jews

1186.32 --> 1189.76
from jews

1187.679 --> 1193.6000000000001
but i'm not sure but i was like really

1189.76 --> 1195.76
like the pattern it is it

1193.6 --> 1198.08
but in that story part there's a lot of

1195.76 --> 1201.679
padding and in retrospect i find that

1198.08 --> 1203.9189999999999
really annoying i'm like damn

1201.679 --> 1206.48
padding sucks

1203.919 --> 1209.1200000000001
i've only become more of a minimalist

1206.48 --> 1209.1200000000001
over time

1211.28 --> 1216.6399999999999
right but when you look for example in

1213.36 --> 1219.36
the list of principles and effects

1216.64 --> 1221.5200000000002
that one is like very short it is almost

1219.36 --> 1224.3999999999999
like a dictionary

1221.52 --> 1225.9189999999999
but it it it is called dictionary even

1224.4 --> 1228.72
principles effect

1225.919 --> 1231.039
let me check it again

1228.72 --> 1234.32
and that part is all just

1231.039 --> 1236.96
like super concise

1234.32 --> 1239.6
like the way i go and talk in that is

1236.96 --> 1241.919
almost the way i talk

1239.6 --> 1242.8799999999999
live here

1241.919 --> 1244.96
it's

1242.88 --> 1246.3200000000002
and that part is like really fascinating

1244.96 --> 1249.039
to me because

1246.32 --> 1250.799
yeah dude i was like trying to reach

1249.039 --> 1253.919
into the future

1250.799 --> 1256.24
i was trying to first [ __ ] like

1253.919 --> 1258.48
everything i was trying to like this is

1256.24 --> 1261.679
going to be a thing i'm going to be the

1258.48 --> 1264.0
one to forge it

1261.679 --> 1266.48
while the iron's still hot and there's

1264.0 --> 1268.88
still a lot of shape ability and nobody

1266.48 --> 1270.88
knows about it right nobody is ready for

1268.88 --> 1273.88
that yet but it's going to be very

1270.88 --> 1273.88
important

1276.24 --> 1278.799
where is it

1282.4 --> 1286.4
there it is

1284.08 --> 1286.3999999999999
all right

1288.0 --> 1293.84
all right now it's just a summary not a

1291.76 --> 1295.919
summary principles effects not a

1293.84 --> 1298.1589999999999
dictionary right

1295.919 --> 1298.159
uh

1299.28 --> 1303.2
right also

1301.2 --> 1305.039
there's still gaps in there it's

1303.2 --> 1308.48
interesting because

1305.039 --> 1309.679
it's like dude do i am so structured in

1308.48 --> 1312.48
like this

1309.679 --> 1314.5590000000002
pattern that is just unspoken i do it in

1312.48 --> 1317.6
everything it's like something that's

1314.559 --> 1320.0
almost elusive to myself but it i do it

1317.6 --> 1322.559
it's out of like a principle that's even

1320.0 --> 1324.32
prioritized beyond my own

1322.559 --> 1325.12
aware consciousness

1324.32 --> 1326.48
and

1325.12 --> 1328.6399999999999
i do that

1326.48 --> 1331.44
i do that with everything

1328.64 --> 1334.7990000000002
i always like leave some gaps

1331.44 --> 1338.0
that you can then fill in using

1334.799 --> 1340.6399999999999
what is learned around it it's like make

1338.0 --> 1342.32
this drawing and that it's a fractal and

1340.64 --> 1343.2
then obviously like oh there's a gap

1342.32 --> 1345.12
there

1343.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
and you're gonna fill that in with your

1345.12 --> 1350.32
mind because you already got the setup

1347.84 --> 1351.9189999999999
you know you should know if you

1350.32 --> 1353.84
understand what it is

1351.919 --> 1357.5200000000002
where it should lead

1353.84 --> 1359.84
right i already gave the parameters

1357.52 --> 1360.6399999999999
so i just put down all these things

1359.84 --> 1361.4399999999998
about

1360.64 --> 1364.5590000000002
like

1361.44 --> 1366.4
different forms of spirits

1364.559 --> 1369.44
and like the different dimensions in a

1366.4 --> 1372.0800000000002
certain framework which is like yeah it

1369.44 --> 1373.679
is different from how i see things now

1372.08 --> 1376.559
it's different from my dark world

1373.679 --> 1379.1200000000001
actually you got to realize this is that

1376.559 --> 1380.72
this setup

1379.12 --> 1383.9189999999999
is not

1380.72 --> 1385.2
based on a dark world experience

1383.919 --> 1387.76
you see

1385.2 --> 1391.52
this was pretty dark

1387.76 --> 1394.52
this was an actual vision

1391.52 --> 1397.36
and the dark world experience was

1394.52 --> 1398.799
reconstructions in my mind in dreams and

1397.36 --> 1401.28
actually

1398.799 --> 1402.8799999999999
still think that it was like more there

1401.28 --> 1405.6789999999999
to test me

1402.88 --> 1408.4
to confuse me

1405.679 --> 1410.159
because yeah

1408.4 --> 1412.24
overall dark world visions were not

1410.159 --> 1415.2
pleasant experiences although i did

1412.24 --> 1418.48
still find gratification in them

1415.2 --> 1418.48
as i went through them

1419.28 --> 1424.32
but it was never just like oh finally

1422.08 --> 1429.0
relief it was never like oh it's a

1424.32 --> 1429.0
paradise or dream or anything never

1430.159 --> 1435.279
i still have those types of experience

1432.4 --> 1438.279
in regular dreams though

1435.279 --> 1438.279
anyway

1440.04 --> 1443.21
[Music]

1450.4 --> 1455.96
troll cunning forge

1452.96 --> 1455.96
what

1458.0 --> 1462.559
okay singing star wars

1461.12 --> 1464.32
never heard of that

1462.559 --> 1466.48
anyway hello

1464.32 --> 1469.8799999999999
hello bobby stills

1466.48 --> 1469.88
kumu virus

1491.279 --> 1495.63
right but one of the weird things that

1494.08 --> 1496.96
really stand out to me

1495.63 --> 1499.279
[Music]

1496.96 --> 1502.0
within the symbolics

1499.279 --> 1504.4
other now cosmology basically spirit

1502.0 --> 1507.6
cosmology as i figured it out and those

1504.4 --> 1508.5590000000002
things are not like oh i just imagined

1507.6 --> 1510.8799999999999
them

1508.559 --> 1512.799
it was all based like on

1510.88 --> 1515.919
world testing

1512.799 --> 1517.84
and like being more open to actual

1515.919 --> 1520.5590000000002
spirits like now

1517.84 --> 1523.76
they don't bother me

1520.559 --> 1526.0
they don't bother me anymore that is

1523.76 --> 1527.679
but they used to

1526.0 --> 1531.36
spirits

1527.679 --> 1531.3600000000001
now i am well

1532.159 --> 1537.3600000000001
much more i guess dominant in my

1534.88 --> 1538.7990000000002
attitude kind of like what i do even on

1537.36 --> 1541.279
the show

1538.799 --> 1543.12
well i didn't always used to be like

1541.279 --> 1544.88
that

1543.12 --> 1548.0
and like

1544.88 --> 1552.3200000000002
well gammas would like get in your face

1548.0 --> 1555.12
so did spirits in a way sometimes not as

1552.32 --> 1558.72
pushy in comparison as

1555.12 --> 1560.1589999999999
like people in chat or anything but

1558.72 --> 1562.48
but

1560.159 --> 1565.5200000000002
yeah i basically decided at some point

1562.48 --> 1566.799
like yeah this is so much noise like

1565.52 --> 1569.2
i'm done

1566.799 --> 1571.52
like i know everything i need to now

1569.2 --> 1574.0
about spirits i don't need to

1571.52 --> 1577.12
communicate with them anymore there's

1574.0 --> 1577.12
nothing else i can learn

1577.52 --> 1580.559
and then i just like

1581.039 --> 1586.96
closed the door and now they don't

1582.799 --> 1586.96
bother me anymore and i sleep great

1587.679 --> 1591.3200000000002
i sleep great

1593.77 --> 1596.799
[Music]

1603.12 --> 1607.12
right but my point that i was going to

1604.72 --> 1608.64
make about the symbolics of the nl

1607.12 --> 1609.76
cosmology

1608.64 --> 1612.4
is

1609.76 --> 1615.679
that it is

1612.4 --> 1617.52
a really fascinating attempt and i think

1615.679 --> 1619.6000000000001
i might have actually been successful

1617.52 --> 1622.0
because it still holds up

1619.6 --> 1624.799
it was an attempt to basically

1622.0 --> 1624.799
mechanize

1625.279 --> 1627.84
morality

1628.08 --> 1632.1589999999999
but

1629.12 --> 1634.4799999999998
calling it like light and darkness

1632.159 --> 1639.4
gods and demons

1634.48 --> 1639.4
and then just build a very

1643.44 --> 1646.3990000000001
how do you call that

1647.039 --> 1652.64
like a structure for it but

1649.919 --> 1655.679
like it is demystified it is almost like

1652.64 --> 1658.3200000000002
a moral approach of morality

1655.679 --> 1658.3200000000002
but still

1658.799 --> 1661.9189999999999
yeah

1660.88 --> 1665.0390000000002
like

1661.919 --> 1666.7990000000002
i i almost can't explain

1665.039 --> 1670.72
what i mean

1666.799 --> 1670.72
maybe you guys still get it but

1671.52 --> 1675.6
it's like just it's almost like

1673.919 --> 1677.6000000000001
like you would see in a computer game

1675.6 --> 1680.559
but computer games like everything is

1677.6 --> 1683.36
still going to be filled in by people

1680.559 --> 1685.84
and they want to have a story right it

1683.36 --> 1689.76
has to have it's supposed to entertain i

1685.84 --> 1691.279
wrote like a skeletal structure

1689.76 --> 1693.12
of like

1691.279 --> 1695.919
the whole thing like the complete

1693.12 --> 1699.1999999999998
cosmology with like little g gods that

1695.919 --> 1701.44
which i by the way used capital g gods

1699.2 --> 1704.159
which is like kind of

1701.44 --> 1706.159
very non-biblical compatible

1704.159 --> 1708.3200000000002
right it's yeah

1706.159 --> 1711.5200000000002
christ allergic in that time so i was

1708.32 --> 1715.12
like making a statement like no

1711.52 --> 1715.12
no this is how i'm doing it

1715.919 --> 1720.64
because yeah if i would have adapted

1718.08 --> 1722.08
then i would have had to like give all

1720.64 --> 1723.679
the biblical

1722.08 --> 1726.24
background knowledge they basically

1723.679 --> 1728.3990000000001
didn't have at the time

1726.24 --> 1730.64
so

1728.399 --> 1735.12
this is how it's manifested

1730.64 --> 1737.679
but the structures are sound

1735.12 --> 1740.32
and i really still do think it works

1737.679 --> 1744.24
like the one as i explain it

1740.32 --> 1745.12
would effectively be god

1744.24 --> 1747.36
right

1745.12 --> 1750.2399999999998
it's the one thing outside of all of it

1747.36 --> 1751.36
it's tied in with the living

1750.24 --> 1754.08
very

1751.36 --> 1756.4799999999998
very specifically like with the soul and

1754.08 --> 1758.559
the spirit like all the mechanics of

1756.48 --> 1759.919
spirit mechanics everything everybody's

1758.559 --> 1762.08
ever learned

1759.919 --> 1766.3200000000002
should be able to fit

1762.08 --> 1769.6
in that structural pattern

1766.32 --> 1769.6
of that cosmology

1777.039 --> 1779.679
like

1778.08 --> 1782.72
everything

1779.679 --> 1785.919
i i think i even wanted to make it with

1782.72 --> 1787.6000000000001
that purpose in mind like

1785.919 --> 1791.1200000000001
to just

1787.6 --> 1793.039
give a uniform structural insight as to

1791.12 --> 1794.7199999999998
how

1793.039 --> 1798.32
religious

1794.72 --> 1798.32
experience and

1798.559 --> 1803.6
connections with the divine and personal

1801.2 --> 1806.8400000000001
viewing of god and all that how that all

1803.6 --> 1809.36
just manifests pretty much no matter

1806.84 --> 1811.039
what because it is in a way very

1809.36 --> 1814.1589999999999
psychological

1811.039 --> 1816.08
like what exactly manifests it's like oh

1814.159 --> 1818.48
you're you're going to approach

1816.08 --> 1821.279
a deity or you're going to

1818.48 --> 1824.72
try to connect to god well

1821.279 --> 1827.44
what you have your sins your darkness

1824.72 --> 1830.799
or the lack thereof and more light is

1827.44 --> 1833.679
going to become the reflection of your

1830.799 --> 1835.039
god basically you see

1833.679 --> 1837.44
it's like

1835.039 --> 1839.6
yeah you might agree like oh we worship

1837.44 --> 1842.0
the same god right because we share the

1839.6 --> 1845.039
book and we all inspired our version of

1842.0 --> 1847.52
god on that book so we have the same god

1845.039 --> 1850.799
but technically everybody has a very and

1847.52 --> 1852.8799999999999
this is still very widely known to too

1850.799 --> 1856.799
everybody has a very personal connection

1852.88 --> 1861.679
with god and how they view him

1856.799 --> 1861.679
is going to depend on who they are

1862.559 --> 1867.76
and that wisdom

1864.799 --> 1870.08
is taken into account a lot

1867.76 --> 1872.0
in how i wrote

1870.08 --> 1874.799
the cosmology

1872.0 --> 1877.799
for symbolic satinal

1874.799 --> 1877.799
anyway

1878.08 --> 1883.12
i don't like horror movies akuma virus

1881.44 --> 1886.559
i mean i've seen enough horror and

1883.12 --> 1890.4399999999998
reality to no longer like the thrill of

1886.559 --> 1890.44
a mystical darkness

1893.679 --> 1898.799
i do like movies that are a bit scared

1896.159 --> 1901.7600000000002
though if there is a

1898.799 --> 1903.6
victorious arc that makes sense

1901.76 --> 1904.64
right if there is an overcoming of the

1903.6 --> 1906.399
darkness

1904.64 --> 1908.0
then i do like it

1906.399 --> 1908.9599999999998
so i do like

1908.0 --> 1913.559
some

1908.96 --> 1913.559
sort of mysterious adventurous

1913.6 --> 1917.76
scary movies

1915.679 --> 1920.72
but if it's just horror it's just this

1917.76 --> 1923.679
all the evil thing and everybody's all

1920.72 --> 1926.559
[ __ ] and doing the gross stupid

1923.679 --> 1929.3600000000001
things and getting killed yeah no thanks

1926.559 --> 1931.2
not really interested

1929.36 --> 1933.6789999999999
but if there is

1931.2 --> 1936.799
like proper character development in the

1933.679 --> 1939.519
face of like mystical creepy things

1936.799 --> 1942.6
then it is worthy enough for me to take

1939.519 --> 1942.6
a look

1974.24 --> 1979.84
with oil wet your decks are anointed how

1977.039 --> 1979.84
does that work

1984.96 --> 1990.8400000000001
what you mean that there's actual oil on

1987.6 --> 1990.84
the cards

1991.76 --> 1997.19
[Music]

1993.76 --> 2000.319
somebody's making pancakes

1997.19 --> 2000.319
[Music]

2007.679 --> 2012.8000000000002
hmm

2009.6 --> 2012.8
[Music]

2020.159 --> 2027.48
spray a blessing a small squirt

2023.279 --> 2027.48
blessed squirt okay

2046.96 --> 2050.879
are you kidding me tara 306

2051.28 --> 2057.2400000000002
there's no movie yet like that yes there

2054.24 --> 2057.24
is

2070.56 --> 2075.919
i mean seriously telekinesis is like a

2074.0 --> 2077.52
staple

2075.919 --> 2079.04
ghost

2077.52 --> 2080.72
story theme

2079.04 --> 2083.2799999999997
i mean like

2080.72 --> 2087.359
ooh flickering lights or

2083.28 --> 2089.2000000000003
chairs moving or much more dramatic

2087.359 --> 2093.04
like house

2089.2 --> 2095.839
air earth house quakes right come on

2093.04 --> 2098.96
that's like basic

2095.839 --> 2098.96
what are you talking about

2099.92 --> 2102.92
what

2103.2 --> 2107.0
hey psych bear

2110.21 --> 2113.369
[Music]

2156.56 --> 2162.7999999999997
would because

2159.119 --> 2162.8
dominoid too that's hilarious

2163.04 --> 2169.04
right yeah but look what interstellar

2165.839 --> 2171.04
did is basically they denounced

2169.04 --> 2172.8
the existence of spirits and the

2171.04 --> 2174.88
afterlife

2172.8 --> 2176.2400000000002
do you understand that that is what it

2174.88 --> 2178.8
was doing

2176.24 --> 2180.8799999999997
with that it's like oh it's a ghost it's

2178.8 --> 2183.119
a mystical thing that's happening it's a

2180.88 --> 2185.76
ghost

2183.119 --> 2188.4
but guess what it wasn't a ghost it was

2185.76 --> 2190.4
him in the future it is

2188.4 --> 2192.48
in the tesseract

2190.4 --> 2195.839
doing that that's like the the

2192.48 --> 2198.8
mind-blowing revelation in a way right

2195.839 --> 2201.52
and it was awesome i was very impressed

2198.8 --> 2203.2000000000003
but after realized what it is is

2201.52 --> 2206.0
basically telling you

2203.2 --> 2208.7999999999997
there is no ghosts it's something more

2206.0 --> 2208.8
mysterious

2208.88 --> 2214.079
from a science of interdimensional

2211.76 --> 2216.7200000000003
thingies and

2214.079 --> 2218.0
they turn it into like a time loop

2216.72 --> 2220.8799999999997
plot

2218.0 --> 2224.32
right but it is the denial of ghosts

2220.88 --> 2226.4
like that there was no hint

2224.32 --> 2227.92
right that it was actually that such

2226.4 --> 2229.76
things are real that we're just saying

2227.92 --> 2233.119
no it's superstition it's all that is

2229.76 --> 2233.119
all fake it can't be that

2233.599 --> 2238.48
and that's what interstellar did you

2235.359 --> 2238.48
have to realize that

2240.56 --> 2243.119
cosmic

2249.599 --> 2255.119
i mean the old ones

2251.76 --> 2256.7200000000003
are you utilized in storytelling

2255.119 --> 2259.119
effectively

2256.72 --> 2262.0
it is like very scary and it is like

2259.119 --> 2263.599
about mind control through fear

2262.0 --> 2266.8
and cults

2263.599 --> 2268.7200000000003
are always involved the lovecraft

2266.8 --> 2271.04
old ones and all that

2268.72 --> 2273.5989999999997
that's interesting

2271.04 --> 2276.56
but loving it

2273.599 --> 2279.56
you love that akumu

2276.56 --> 2279.56
that's

2285.44 --> 2288.48
i mean

2286.72 --> 2291.04
yeah my friends

2288.48 --> 2294.8
my yeah friends in the past were like

2291.04 --> 2296.079
big chulu fans and like i think he's

2294.8 --> 2299.599
a cool

2296.079 --> 2301.44
fantasy concept

2299.599 --> 2304.079
but

2301.44 --> 2304.079
loving it

2304.16 --> 2307.16
um

2308.51 --> 2311.7090000000003
[Music]

2313.119 --> 2317.44
like the one thing that i never really

2314.88 --> 2319.28
did like about the whole old ones and

2317.44 --> 2321.68
even the games that came out of it is

2319.28 --> 2324.079
that you can never win like you always

2321.68 --> 2327.839
lose in the end

2324.079 --> 2330.2400000000002
i don't like that at all

2327.839 --> 2334.4
although maybe fair enough if you like

2330.24 --> 2335.359
dabble into like the pure darkness

2334.4 --> 2338.64
into

2335.359 --> 2340.56
the essence of evil then yeah that is

2338.64 --> 2342.3199999999997
kind of what does happen

2340.56 --> 2344.16
it's just that

2342.32 --> 2347.52
i don't really want to do that

2344.16 --> 2349.5989999999997
not even in a fiction

2347.52 --> 2352.32
right i don't want to challenge evil

2349.599 --> 2353.119
unless i am certain

2352.32 --> 2355.599
that

2353.119 --> 2359.92
that i can yeah that i'm not just going

2355.599 --> 2359.92
to end up sacrificing myself for that

2360.8 --> 2363.04
right

2364.29 --> 2369.599
[Music]

2366.24 --> 2372.64
he made that university

2369.599 --> 2372.6400000000003
creative yeah

2375.2 --> 2378.64
sure

2376.32 --> 2381.04
yeah it was it's interesting enough i

2378.64 --> 2383.359
mean in a way like even dungeons and

2381.04 --> 2386.24
dragons cosmology

2383.359 --> 2388.7999999999997
had learned a lot

2386.24 --> 2391.68
from lovecraft as well

2388.8 --> 2394.5600000000004
as well as like other

2391.68 --> 2398.0
science fiction stories

2394.56 --> 2398.0
and fantasy stories but

2402.079 --> 2407.76
yeah lovecraft did kind of like really

2405.359 --> 2409.7599999999998
put down on the map like alternative

2407.76 --> 2411.599
dimensions that were really weird and

2409.76 --> 2413.8390000000004
freaky

2411.599 --> 2416.1600000000003
maybe i don't know though if he's like

2413.839 --> 2418.48
the very first one to actually bring up

2416.16 --> 2419.5299999999997
something like that in in halfway decent

2418.48 --> 2422.719
stories

2419.53 --> 2422.719
[Music]

2422.72 --> 2427.4399999999996
but he basically successfully manifested

2425.52 --> 2430.72
that as an option

2427.44 --> 2432.88
within creative thinking

2430.72 --> 2435.81
so yeah

2432.88 --> 2439.05
i get it

2435.81 --> 2439.0499999999997
[Music]

2442.72 --> 2447.72
i mean lovecraft is just very gothic

2454.16 --> 2457.44
hey clutch good to see you

2462.96 --> 2468.8
right but uh yeah when i made symbolic

2465.92 --> 2471.119
saturn l lovecraft was not what i had in

2468.8 --> 2471.119
mind

2472.48 --> 2476.079
it was a very it was

2474.96 --> 2478.7200000000003
very

2476.079 --> 2479.6800000000003
very seriously dedicated to the real

2478.72 --> 2482.24
world

2479.68 --> 2485.2799999999997
to not be led

2482.24 --> 2487.4399999999996
by preconceived stories like not even

2485.28 --> 2489.92
lord of the rings

2487.44 --> 2492.4
even though i did absolutely know that

2489.92 --> 2494.8
book and like

2492.4 --> 2496.56
found it amazing

2494.8 --> 2498.96
i just

2496.56 --> 2501.68
i really wanted it to be

2498.96 --> 2504.68
about the actual real world not to get

2501.68 --> 2504.68
distracted

2508.56 --> 2512.96
by fiction

2510.56 --> 2514.7999999999997
which is very easy like if you start

2512.96 --> 2517.28
loving fiction if you respect it then

2514.8 --> 2520.1600000000003
it's very likely you start to adapt your

2517.28 --> 2521.599
thinking and patterns of assumption to

2520.16 --> 2523.92
that fiction

2521.599 --> 2526.079
like it starts to manifest your view on

2523.92 --> 2528.319
the real world and i wanted to prevent

2526.079 --> 2530.2400000000002
that in this study because symbolics are

2528.319 --> 2534.319
now was like a very

2530.24 --> 2535.839
very serious wizard study

2534.319 --> 2538.48
and everybody's just

2535.839 --> 2542.319
look at that silly arwyn guy

2538.48 --> 2544.56
thinks he's a wizard like yeah yeah

2542.319 --> 2547.2
still gonna do this though

2544.56 --> 2550.4
i don't care if nobody ever finds out if

2547.2 --> 2551.2799999999997
nobody will ever care or mention or use

2550.4 --> 2552.56
or

2551.28 --> 2554.48
whatever

2552.56 --> 2559.24
it just gets deleted and lost forever

2554.48 --> 2559.2400000000002
i'm still gonna do it and i did

2570.64 --> 2577.8799999999997
ah

2572.56 --> 2577.88
off to work psych bear on a sunday what

2580.3 --> 2583.51

that's a

2632.079 --> 2635.8390000000004
busy working man then i guess

2637.44 --> 2641.839
as long as you can handle that

2639.76 --> 2644.4
i mean if i had like actual more

2641.839 --> 2648.4
physical work that i'd be doing

2644.4 --> 2650.88
i definitely would want a day off

2648.4 --> 2653.04
because otherwise i just start to freeze

2650.88 --> 2653.04
up

2654.56 --> 2658.16
i need the day for active real

2656.56 --> 2661.96
relaxation i don't know what type of

2658.16 --> 2661.96
work you do right away

2682.64 --> 2684.8799999999997
what

2685.119 --> 2691.839

2688.64 --> 2691.839

2774.16 --> 2777.44
call her out of

2775.52 --> 2779.68
lovecraft movie

2777.44 --> 2779.68
huh

2784.319 --> 2787.119
never heard of that

2787.28 --> 2792.4
there's one lovecraft movie

2790.4 --> 2794.96
was it again

2792.4 --> 2796.079
i think it was like a a spanish

2794.96 --> 2798.8
one

2796.079 --> 2800.4
but that one was like really about

2798.8 --> 2804.4
lovecraft

2800.4 --> 2807.6800000000003
it's like this ocean village

2804.4 --> 2810.96
and was infiltrated by like an old one

2807.68 --> 2812.96
cult it was really all about that

2810.96 --> 2815.52
what's the name again

2812.96 --> 2818.96
ah man i probably

2815.52 --> 2818.96
don't have it on my computer

2824.319 --> 2830.56
let me check maybe i do

2827.04 --> 2834.24
i'll recognize it

2830.56 --> 2834.24
this is a long time ago

2834.8 --> 2837.599
what's that again

well nothing like really specific

3560.48 --> 3563.68
i mean

3561.359 --> 3566.799
that when like

3563.68 --> 3569.68
we were digging into like pancho train

3566.799 --> 3569.68
bridge footage

3570.48 --> 3574.64
a lot of people compared it to like

3572.48 --> 3577.359
footage of just putting their camera on

3574.64 --> 3579.2
a bridge and then like the heat made

3577.359 --> 3581.2799999999997
everything just

3579.2 --> 3585.3999999999996
mirage

3581.28 --> 3585.4
out of sight quickly

3586.64 --> 3590.0789999999997
uh wait

3588.079 --> 3592.48
is it uh what's it called again there's

3590.079 --> 3595.28
one channel that typically

3592.48 --> 3597.68
is always busying themselves with that

3595.28 --> 3598.88
what do they call again

3597.68 --> 3601.2
isn't it

3598.88 --> 3603.92
life fly bry

3601.2 --> 3603.9199999999996

3605.839 --> 3609.16

3626.96 --> 3634.76
why the hell am i subscribed to brenda

3648.48 --> 3651.48
um

3670.4 --> 3677.119
sky 3 that's the one

3673.28 --> 3679.52
whoa the movie's already downloaded

3677.119 --> 3680.88
damn yeah it wasn't sky flavor it's sky

3679.52 --> 3683.839
free

3680.88 --> 3686.319
right so sky free

3683.839 --> 3689.2799999999997
pretty much every video they've made is

3686.319 --> 3690.4
about miraging effects

3689.28 --> 3693.119
it is

3690.4 --> 3696.64
super elaborate

3693.119 --> 3698.96
there's bound to be at least one road

3696.64 --> 3701.7599999999998
miraging video in there somewhere

3698.96 --> 3704.16
although most of their videos are about

3701.76 --> 3706.7990000000004
sites over water

3704.16 --> 3707.92
also sites in the room all kinds of

3706.799 --> 3709.44
things

3707.92 --> 3711.28
but this is pretty much the most

3709.44 --> 3713.76
specialized

3711.28 --> 3716.2400000000002
channel that i've seen considering like

3713.76 --> 3721.6400000000003
well optical miraging effects and all

3716.24 --> 3721.64
that so check that one out elise g

3728.4 --> 3731.4
uh

3749.2 --> 3751.5989999999997
what

3752.4 --> 3757.2000000000003
akuma virus you go do that why don't you

3755.119 --> 3758.4
do that

3757.2 --> 3761.839
i mean

3758.4 --> 3761.839
you could make a rap video

3763.3 --> 3766.8990000000003
[Music]

3767.52 --> 3770.319
yeah

3768.16 --> 3773.5989999999997
[Music]

3770.319 --> 3773.599
yeah good luck at least g

3774.88 --> 3779.119
and like if you're gonna dig into it

3776.72 --> 3782.0
you're at least gonna be likely to find

3779.119 --> 3784.559
adjacent

3782.0 --> 3784.559
videos

3790.24 --> 3792.64
anyway

3794.24 --> 3797.839
right akuma virus go for it

3798.72 --> 3802.24
i mean like

3800.559 --> 3803.2000000000003
you

3802.24 --> 3805.4399999999996
and

3803.2 --> 3809.24
chocolate and elijah could

3805.44 --> 3809.2400000000002
do like a rap battles

3816.079 --> 3819.8390000000004
i mean that would be interesting

3821.119 --> 3826.799
instead of like a baller versus flat

3823.359 --> 3829.92
earth or debate how about a rap battle

3826.799 --> 3832.079
i mean there's already videos about that

3829.92 --> 3835.559
although it is all like pre-setup of

3832.079 --> 3835.559
course right

3843.52 --> 3847.599
right but yeah rap battles are kind of

3845.599 --> 3851.28
pointless if we don't have actual

3847.599 --> 3853.6800000000003
opponents that really make the effort

3851.28 --> 3856.2400000000002
right this is by the way the same counts

3853.68 --> 3857.9199999999996
for debates in general it's this we

3856.24 --> 3860.72
don't really have a lot of worthy

3857.92 --> 3860.7200000000003
opponents left

3862.88 --> 3870.28
my friend you've been in a few well

3864.559 --> 3870.28
there you go you have found your destiny

3910.24 --> 3913.5989999999997
anyway i'm not personally gonna take pl

3912.559 --> 3915.92
yeah

3913.599 --> 3919.119
gonna be part of that rap battle

3915.92 --> 3919.119
rap is not my thing

3920.96 --> 3926.92
i would just start to do it super kooky

3923.599 --> 3926.92
on purpose

3946.24 --> 3951.839
wow is she playing devil's advocate

3949.119 --> 3951.839
aren't we

3954.96 --> 3957.839
i mean

3955.839 --> 3960.16
sure why not

3957.839 --> 3962.0789999999997
but let him try to make the brenda had a

3960.16 --> 3965.5589999999997
shoe song first

3962.079 --> 3965.559
or a rap

3969.2 --> 3973.0389999999998
i mean just because he says he's done it

3971.119 --> 3976.039
doesn't mean he's actually any good at

3973.039 --> 3976.039
it

4005.44 --> 4008.7200000000003
right so anyhow

4011.28 --> 4013.599
yeah

4012.16 --> 4016.48
yesterday

4013.599 --> 4018.1600000000003
on ball busters i had a little personal

4016.48 --> 4020.2400000000002
discovery

4018.16 --> 4022.5589999999997
that had absolute in irwinian

4020.24 --> 4026.0
old-fashioned style had absolutely

4022.559 --> 4027.76
nothing to do with the subject at hand

4026.0 --> 4029.359
i used to have a lot of those moments

4027.76 --> 4033.48
back in the day

4029.359 --> 4033.48
then like five years ago

4034.4 --> 4037.839
your own worst critic

4041.839 --> 4045.119
maybe

4043.039 --> 4048.7200000000003
but yeah i discovered something about

4045.119 --> 4052.079
the concept of terrestrial refraction

4048.72 --> 4054.3999999999996
which besides it being a paradox my

4052.079 --> 4057.28
paradox of course

4054.4 --> 4060.64
right you can have

4057.28 --> 4060.6400000000003
a geometric horizon

4060.72 --> 4064.24
if there's terrestrial refraction and

4062.72 --> 4066.16
how are you going to establish the

4064.24 --> 4068.0789999999997
radius value if you can no longer use

4066.16 --> 4069.359
the horizon to establish the radius

4068.079 --> 4071.8390000000004
value

4069.359 --> 4074.64
right arwenian paradox but i discovered

4071.839 --> 4077.839
an interesting little detail about the

4074.64 --> 4077.839
entire premise of it

4077.92 --> 4082.079
and i'm kind of surprised it never came

4079.76 --> 4085.599
up with this before because yeah black

4082.079 --> 4085.599
swan's been around for a while

4085.92 --> 4091.119
but yeah look

4088.799 --> 4092.319
let's just say terrestrial refraction is

4091.119 --> 4095.28
real

4092.319 --> 4097.6
and the geometric horizon is being

4095.28 --> 4100.4800000000005
miraged upward

4097.6 --> 4102.400000000001
into an apparent flat plane

4100.48 --> 4106.959999999999
well that's basically an optical

4102.4 --> 4108.96
illusion right optical illusion is when

4106.96 --> 4111.679
light is

4108.96 --> 4114.56
bent and displaced and then you see it

4111.679 --> 4116.799
in a spot where it well geometrically

4114.56 --> 4119.839000000001
isn't really at

4116.799 --> 4119.839
but here's the thing

4120.159 --> 4125.759
if terrestrial refraction were real

4123.12 --> 4127.679
then at night when it's actually really

4125.759 --> 4131.12
dark and there's like no moonlight or

4127.679 --> 4132.56
anything but there might be stars

4131.12 --> 4135.599999999999
maybe there is a moon it doesn't really

4132.56 --> 4139.759
matter right point is

4135.6 --> 4142.159000000001
if at night terrestrial refraction makes

4139.759 --> 4144.48
the geometric horizon

4142.159 --> 4146.4
mirage upwards

4144.48 --> 4149.5199999999995
visually displace itself

4146.4 --> 4151.839
so that it still seems like a flat plane

4149.52 --> 4151.839000000001
well

4152.48 --> 4157.599999999999
that means that there is effectively an

4155.52 --> 4160.0
illusion presupposing terrestrial

4157.6 --> 4162.319
affection there's an illusion

4160.0 --> 4164.159
of well black

4162.319 --> 4166.080000000001
because it's mostly just dark at night

4164.159 --> 4169.04
right so that darkness is going to be

4166.08 --> 4171.839
displaced upward

4169.04 --> 4173.92
well it's an illusion

4171.839 --> 4175.759
you can shine through an illusion if

4173.92 --> 4176.719
something is actually not there and

4175.759 --> 4179.52
there's a

4176.719 --> 4181.679
bright light shining behind it

4179.52 --> 4184.719
there's a chance it's gonna be visible

4181.679 --> 4187.679
even through the mirage

4184.719 --> 4188.88
right where you see like an oasis or

4187.679 --> 4191.92
something

4188.88 --> 4194.4800000000005
you could still just see a light

4191.92 --> 4197.4400000000005
shining right through like a tree or

4194.48 --> 4199.12
something that you might see

4197.44 --> 4201.36
right or the water

4199.12 --> 4203.5199999999995
you'll see it right through because

4201.36 --> 4206.639999999999
there's nothing physically stopping it

4203.52 --> 4208.159000000001
it's like a hologram it's a mirage it's

4206.64 --> 4209.84
light

4208.159 --> 4211.599999999999
or other light

4209.84 --> 4213.76
could shine through that

4211.6 --> 4215.120000000001
and where would you notice this the most

4213.76 --> 4216.4800000000005
at night

4215.12 --> 4219.199
because at night

4216.48 --> 4221.44
it's very dark so if then the geometric

4219.199 --> 4223.199
horizon is all bent upward with the

4221.44 --> 4224.879999999999
mirage

4223.199 --> 4226.879999999999
you're still

4224.88 --> 4228.64
going to see

4226.88 --> 4229.679
starlight

4228.64 --> 4231.92
through

4229.679 --> 4234.8
that mirage

4231.92 --> 4236.0
you should be able to see the stars

4234.8 --> 4239.92
through

4236.0 --> 4242.08
the horizon because it's all just black

4239.92 --> 4244.4800000000005
and black is not

4242.08 --> 4247.36
like black isn't a mirage that would be

4244.48 --> 4247.36
black would be

4249.36 --> 4252.48
well

4250.239 --> 4255.04
transparent it's just the lack of light

4252.48 --> 4257.839999999999
so any light shining physically right

4255.04 --> 4259.92
through that like from stars you would

4257.84 --> 4261.1990000000005
just see it you would be able to see the

4259.92 --> 4264.159
stars

4261.199 --> 4266.159
beyond the apparent horizon into the

4264.159 --> 4269.92
ground seemingly

4266.159 --> 4272.159
up until the geometric horizon

4269.92 --> 4274.56
because it's all dark and what is

4272.159 --> 4278.719
preventing the starlight from going

4274.56 --> 4280.2390000000005
straight through that when it's all dark

4278.719 --> 4281.52
right

4280.239 --> 4284.879999999999
so this

4281.52 --> 4288.400000000001
just goes to show that even the the

4284.88 --> 4289.92
warping idea of terrestrial refraction

4288.4 --> 4291.679
has a

4289.92 --> 4293.76
critical flaw

4291.679 --> 4296.8
and that is if it is actually an

4293.76 --> 4299.12
illusion bent upwards well there's still

4296.8 --> 4300.400000000001
light gonna shine right through that

4299.12 --> 4303.199
especially

4300.4 --> 4303.199
when it's dark

4304.4 --> 4309.199
so do we see stars

4306.56 --> 4312.159000000001
shining through the ground and the trees

4309.199 --> 4314.4
which are mirages bent upwards

4312.159 --> 4316.799999999999
no no we don't

4314.4 --> 4319.12
we don't

4316.8 --> 4321.1990000000005
see like the moon

4319.12 --> 4323.12
straight through the ground

4321.199 --> 4325.678999999999
no actually it does kind of disappear

4323.12 --> 4327.679
before it hits this apparent

4325.679 --> 4330.8
in this case presupposed terrestrial

4327.679 --> 4332.4800000000005
refraction apparent horizon

4330.8 --> 4333.84
so

4332.48 --> 4336.239
it's just

4333.84 --> 4338.2390000000005
even if you would assume that it is

4336.239 --> 4342.4
there it would have inevitable

4338.239 --> 4345.04
consequences which would be the site

4342.4 --> 4347.12
of celestial bodies shining straight

4345.04 --> 4349.199
through the ground which had been

4347.12 --> 4350.64
miraged upwards into an apparent flat

4349.199 --> 4353.5199999999995
plane

4350.64 --> 4355.4400000000005
we don't see stars going right through

4353.52 --> 4359.52
the ground

4355.44 --> 4361.44
shining through the ground darkness

4359.52 --> 4363.1990000000005
so

4361.44 --> 4366.719
yeah

4363.199 --> 4370.159
that only means that it's not a mirage

4366.719 --> 4372.4
and the geometric horizon is just the

4370.159 --> 4375.44
horizon it's just not a

4372.4 --> 4377.92
low geomet geometry horizon but the

4375.44 --> 4380.239
ground is actually physically there

4377.92 --> 4381.76
because there's no star light shining

4380.239 --> 4385.839999999999
right through it

4381.76 --> 4385.84
at night from the bottom of it

4387.76 --> 4392.8
right so that's uh

4390.0 --> 4396.679
another addendum i guess

4392.8 --> 4396.679
that i figured out yesterday

4400.88 --> 4404.84
hope you appreciate that

4408.47 --> 4417.04
[Music]

4413.92 --> 4417.04
yeah thank you zoidberg

4419.44 --> 4424.32
right it's just that oh oh okay so so

4422.48 --> 4427.199
let's entertain the idea that

4424.32 --> 4429.92
terrestrial refraction is real

4427.199 --> 4432.4
let's basically believe it it's the next

4429.92 --> 4434.4
level of global leap right

4432.4 --> 4436.799999999999
terrestrial refraction oh finally no

4434.4 --> 4439.12
more black swan issues it's just

4436.8 --> 4440.8
it just seems flat that's all because

4439.12 --> 4442.96
it's all bent

4440.8 --> 4445.12
well that means that you're claiming

4442.96 --> 4448.08
that there is an illusion

4445.12 --> 4450.0
being displaced because of light bending

4448.08 --> 4451.92
making it seem flat well if it's an

4450.0 --> 4454.719
illusion it's not physically there then

4451.92 --> 4458.719
that means that if it's all dark

4454.719 --> 4460.56
light is gonna shine right through it

4458.719 --> 4463.04
starlight

4460.56 --> 4463.04
moonlight

4463.6 --> 4468.88
because it's dark it's not a physical

4466.32 --> 4471.28
object blocking it it's a mirage that's

4468.88 --> 4473.28
been displaced upward

4471.28 --> 4474.32
so you should just see light right

4473.28 --> 4476.4
through it

4474.32 --> 4478.08
because it's not

4476.4 --> 4482.879999999999
very bright it doesn't have a lot of

4478.08 --> 4485.12
light in that mirage effect at night

4482.88 --> 4485.12
right

4485.6 --> 4490.2390000000005
so you should just see like oh the

4487.92 --> 4492.56
horizon and maybe a mountain and

4490.239 --> 4494.839999999999
something and then you should just see

4492.56 --> 4496.8
like stars right through the

4494.84 --> 4498.64
mountain or

4496.8 --> 4500.56
at the bottom at the ground you

4498.64 --> 4504.08
should just see that

4500.56 --> 4504.080000000001
because it's all dark

4506.08 --> 4511.84
and it's all refracted upward into that

4508.88 --> 4514.159000000001
apparent flat lane geometry

4511.84 --> 4516.0
but it isn't actually you're claiming

4514.159 --> 4518.08
it's terrestrially refracted so it

4516.0 --> 4520.32
should have an actual globe geometry

4518.08 --> 4522.159
underneath that well the globe geometry

4520.32 --> 4524.96
starlight isn't going to shine through

4522.159 --> 4526.96
that even if it's dark but the mirage

4524.96 --> 4530.08
part that comes from terrestrial

4526.96 --> 4534.2390000000005
refraction it should have star light

4530.08 --> 4534.239
going right through it at night

4534.719 --> 4538.64
yeah that's

4536.0 --> 4540.239
literally entertaining the entire

4538.64 --> 4542.4800000000005
machination

4540.239 --> 4544.799999999999
and then pointing out the problem within

4542.48 --> 4546.4
the machinations one of my favorite

4544.8 --> 4547.92
pastimes

4546.4 --> 4552.599999999999
done it a lot

4547.92 --> 4552.6
over the over the last few years

4591.44 --> 4597.678999999999
yeah so naming my show after this it's

4594.32 --> 4597.679
definitely worth the subject

4598.159 --> 4601.48
hey cleary

4611.04 --> 4614.48
wish to subscribe to my news who are we

4613.28 --> 4616.5599999999995
talking about

4614.48 --> 4618.799999999999
i unfortunately don't have a newsletter

4616.56 --> 4623.84
i just have announcements

4618.8 --> 4623.84
on my show and on that letter debate and

4624.0 --> 4629.36
ball busters and in chats out there

4627.36 --> 4631.44
i mean in the evening when jim bob's

4629.36 --> 4632.48
going live i'm i'm going ballistic in

4631.44 --> 4633.678999999999
that chat

4632.48 --> 4637.12
i'm just like

4633.679 --> 4639.76
divining the [ __ ] out of the place

4637.12 --> 4639.76
can't help it

4642.239 --> 4646.639999999999
oh just saying yeah no no problem you

4644.8 --> 4649.04
should agree because it's true i mean

4646.64 --> 4651.679
yeah if they really think

4649.04 --> 4654.4
terrestrial fraction

4651.679 --> 4656.8
is what's going on well that's a claim

4654.4 --> 4659.04
about a mirage a mirage is not a

4656.8 --> 4661.12
geometric obstruction

4659.04 --> 4663.84
if it's going to be a dark mirage that

4661.12 --> 4665.76
means that light then should just be

4663.84 --> 4667.76
shining right through it

4665.76 --> 4669.4400000000005
you should be able to see it

4667.76 --> 4670.88
like the stars you should literally just

4669.44 --> 4672.5599999999995
see like the stars going through

4670.88 --> 4674.96
mountains and all that

4672.56 --> 4676.96
at night

4674.96 --> 4679.84
oh you don't

4676.96 --> 4682.159
yeah well that's because it's not a

4679.84 --> 4685.28
mirage it's actually

4682.159 --> 4685.28
physical obstruction

4688.32 --> 4693.599999999999
right but physical obstruction not in

4690.8 --> 4698.56
accordance to globe geometry

4693.6 --> 4698.56
but in accordance to flat plane geometry

4699.84 --> 4706.04
right so yeah that's another little

4702.719 --> 4706.04
little trinket

4706.08 --> 4712.32
entertain us in this inevitable victory

4710.0 --> 4714.239
philosophically right but unfortunately

4712.32 --> 4717.159
psychologically and socially that

4714.239 --> 4721.239
victory is not going to be as

4717.159 --> 4721.239
overwhelmingly straightforward

4730.89 --> 4738.839
[Music]

4739.12 --> 4741.5199999999995
but at least

4740.4 --> 4743.5199999999995
yeah

4741.52 --> 4745.360000000001
i do discover little thingies that'll

4743.52 --> 4746.96
just make you think right and make you

4745.36 --> 4749.839999999999
think about

4746.96 --> 4752.8
yeah oh you have presuppositions you

4749.84 --> 4754.8
have ideas you have a cosmology you have

4752.8 --> 4756.56
mechanics that you're relying on and

4754.8 --> 4758.2390000000005
everybody gets that

4756.56 --> 4760.88
but do you actually understand the

4758.239 --> 4764.48
consequences like do you understand the

4760.88 --> 4766.719
consequences of assumptions of setups

4764.48 --> 4768.4
right it's called emulation

4766.719 --> 4771.84
so if you're going to presuppose these

4768.4 --> 4773.679
things like evolutable it's

4771.84 --> 4775.76
it's terrestrially refracted i'm like

4773.679 --> 4777.76
yeah sure i can do that it's just oh i'm

4775.76 --> 4780.719
emulating it i'm emulating it in my head

4777.76 --> 4783.92
right now and i'm looking at oh

4780.719 --> 4785.679
what is this that i'm emulating

4783.92 --> 4787.6
what should it be

4785.679 --> 4788.84
what's gonna happen

4787.6 --> 4791.6
let's get

4788.84 --> 4794.2390000000005
analytical what should be happening

4791.6 --> 4797.1990000000005
right this is also how i discovered that

4794.239 --> 4799.839999999999
the stars are not like a sheet moving

4797.199 --> 4801.919999999999
over a flat plane because then you would

4799.84 --> 4804.96
have the natural consequences of the

4801.92 --> 4806.8
stars going towards the horizon and then

4804.96 --> 4810.4
slowing down more and more and more and

4806.8 --> 4811.28
more and more and more like a

4810.4 --> 4813.839999999999
star

4811.28 --> 4817.12
globe around you that then would not

4813.84 --> 4818.639
just cut off at the horizon

4817.12 --> 4822.239
but instead

4818.639 --> 4824.56
like wave out like a blanket would like

4822.239 --> 4827.12
fold in the stars would just get more

4824.56 --> 4829.52
compacted and then like fold into the

4827.12 --> 4832.32
horizon that is what would happen

4829.52 --> 4835.1990000000005
if it was actually stars like a sheet

4832.32 --> 4836.88
over a flat earth with actual positions

4835.199 --> 4837.599999999999
right

4836.88 --> 4839.92
i

4837.6 --> 4843.1990000000005
figured that out through simulation and

4839.92 --> 4846.84
i figured it out very early

4843.199 --> 4846.839999999999
as in 2015-2006

4848.32 --> 4855.679
one of my first insight discoveries

4852.639 --> 4858.639
that i attained through simulation is

4855.679 --> 4861.1990000000005
like oh okay let's presuppose this

4858.639 --> 4863.679
now let's make it real

4861.199 --> 4865.919999999999
and let's see everything about it

4863.679 --> 4867.84
what would be there

4865.92 --> 4869.6
let's do it honestly

4867.84 --> 4874.360000000001
and that's how you make these types of

4869.6 --> 4874.360000000001
discoveries that's how i figure it out

4878.08 --> 4885.04
huh hey gadget inspector

4880.96 --> 4885.04
enjoying the infeed wars product

4885.6 --> 4889.1990000000005
yeah sure

4887.44 --> 4890.48
yeah the iodine's certainly doing me

4889.199 --> 4891.199
some good

4890.48 --> 4893.5199999999995
and

4891.199 --> 4895.199
i've also already tried the the krill

4893.52 --> 4897.92
oil

4895.199 --> 4902.4
and that seems to

4897.92 --> 4904.56
do some very interesting things

4902.4 --> 4908.0
i think that it actually fixed the

4904.56 --> 4908.0
situation in my jaw

4908.08 --> 4911.6
like

4909.199 --> 4911.599999999999
a lot

4912.159 --> 4917.28
in ways it's like maybe they had just

4914.56 --> 4919.4400000000005
unique compounds that were just like

4917.28 --> 4921.04
exactly what i needed and it just wasn't

4919.44 --> 4923.599999999999
getting it from other food even from

4921.04 --> 4925.12
regular fish oil

4923.6 --> 4927.280000000001
it could have been the iodine too i

4925.12 --> 4928.639
don't know but i've taken some of both

4927.28 --> 4931.36
it's been

4928.639 --> 4933.52
good i had a really good sleep

4931.36 --> 4936.96
also because it cooled down a bit had

4933.52 --> 4940.56
some interesting dreams

4936.96 --> 4944.2390000000005
or female dreams sometimes it's annoying

4940.56 --> 4946.4800000000005
because it's all so attractive

4944.239 --> 4946.48
uh

4946.719 --> 4950.36
hey steven traveler

4971.36 --> 4975.599999999999
what are you talking about shouldn't at

4973.52 --> 4978.719
least the moon rise twice what do you

4975.6 --> 4981.4400000000005
mean moon rising

4978.719 --> 4985.08
what is this moon rise

4981.44 --> 4985.08
you're talking about

4987.679 --> 4993.52
the moon doesn't rise it just appears

4992.0 --> 4995.679
it just

4993.52 --> 4998.2390000000005
there it is there's the moon and then oh

4995.679 --> 5002.56
look the horizon it goes down again it

4998.239 --> 5006.239
doesn't go down the horizon no it just

5002.56 --> 5007.4400000000005
faces out there is no moon rise or moon

5006.239 --> 5009.599999999999
set

5007.44 --> 5011.599999999999
that's why those words don't exist

5009.6 --> 5012.639
because it doesn't do that the sun does

5011.6 --> 5016.0
that

5012.639 --> 5020.1990000000005
the moon does it it phases out

5016.0 --> 5020.199
yeah try to explain that heliocentrists

5029.9 --> 5033.5199999999995
[Music]

5031.28 --> 5033.5199999999995
hmm

5036.88 --> 5039.88
travis

5042.88 --> 5046.28
which travis

5082.32 --> 5085.84
what the [ __ ]

5088.8 --> 5092.56
holy [ __ ] there's a lot of people

5094.32 --> 5097.5599999999995
in masturbation

5114.8 --> 5120.88
what's the creators

5117.92 --> 5123.679
are they shadows out of or what what are

5120.88 --> 5123.679
you talking about

5124.08 --> 5129.5199999999995
i'm not getting mad it's just a really

5126.0 --> 5129.52
weird way to ask questions

5133.92 --> 5141.08
shadows like what what makes you say

5136.56 --> 5141.080000000001
that a hologram would be a shadow

5141.92 --> 5146.639
i mean hologram is a hologram a shadow

5144.08 --> 5151.4
is a shadow shadow come from physical

5146.639 --> 5151.400000000001
things holograms are not physical

5161.52 --> 5164.84
what's that

5176.48 --> 5180.839999999999
national geographic what

5188.32 --> 5195.159
okay a planetary alignment

5191.52 --> 5195.159000000001
venus jupiter

5200.48 --> 5203.28
oh

5201.52 --> 5204.8
okay there's a whole bunch of lineups

5203.28 --> 5207.8
apparently

5204.8 --> 5207.8
woohoo

5220.0 --> 5224.96
the features on the moon are they

5221.52 --> 5228.4800000000005
reflecting our earth no

5224.96 --> 5228.4800000000005
the moon is not a reflector

5233.36 --> 5238.4
i mean whatever that is what we're

5235.679 --> 5242.88
seeing

5238.4 --> 5242.879999999999
it might be some weird

5243.12 --> 5249.36
reflection

5245.84 --> 5252.08
or like a mirror that is then being

5249.36 --> 5254.799999999999
projected like a hologram right it might

5252.08 --> 5257.04
be some kind of weird mirror situation a

5254.8 --> 5259.1990000000005
warped mirror it's very warped

5257.04 --> 5260.96
gotta realize it's as funny as it gets

5259.199 --> 5264.839999999999
that mirror of earth

5260.96 --> 5269.36
supposedly even even even if it is

5264.84 --> 5269.360000000001
that and that mirror is then

5269.52 --> 5273.679
made holographic

5271.44 --> 5273.678999999999
like

5273.84 --> 5278.0
the image that comes from that

5275.6 --> 5281.280000000001
reflection would then be projected

5278.0 --> 5284.0
outward the not the mirror itself

5281.28 --> 5286.239
as part of the celestial holograms

5284.0 --> 5287.52
non-local

5286.239 --> 5289.599999999999
right

5287.52 --> 5291.76
so it's whatever it is it's not

5289.6 --> 5293.360000000001
literally a mirror you're seeing

5291.76 --> 5295.92
it's a hologram

5293.36 --> 5297.759999999999
but that hologram might be derived

5295.92 --> 5300.32
somehow

5297.76 --> 5303.92
in the celestial mechanism

5300.32 --> 5308.639
from earth but if it is it's a very

5303.92 --> 5310.4800000000005
distorted warp mirror all over the place

5308.639 --> 5311.84
maybe the warping is even kind of

5310.48 --> 5313.919999999999
consistent

5311.84 --> 5316.639
maybe you could even like back engineer

5313.92 --> 5319.1990000000005
a a very specific type of pattern with

5316.639 --> 5322.32
which it has been worked

5319.199 --> 5325.28
to potentially try to unwarp it which

5322.32 --> 5327.759999999999
would be very complicated process to get

5325.28 --> 5327.759999999999
that right

5328.159 --> 5333.32
to do with algorithms and like fractals

5336.239 --> 5340.239
the moon has its own light yeah of

5337.6 --> 5340.2390000000005
course it does

5340.96 --> 5346.32
i mean holograms have light they do

5343.44 --> 5348.239
radiate light even local ones

5346.32 --> 5353.639
and the moon definitely has its own

5348.239 --> 5353.638999999999
light how i don't know but it does

5362.66 --> 5365.849999999999
[Music]

5372.639 --> 5375.639
what

5382.159 --> 5387.12
no but it doesn't work it can't work

5384.48 --> 5387.12
sideways

5387.76 --> 5393.360000000001
the the celestials are not terrestrially

5391.28 --> 5395.599999999999
reflect refracted

5393.36 --> 5399.44
that's not part of that idea that's why

5395.6 --> 5401.76
it's called terrestrial refraction

5399.44 --> 5404.799999999999
it's the earth

5401.76 --> 5408.159000000001
that's presupposedly being bent

5404.8 --> 5408.159000000001
not the celestials

5408.56 --> 5412.400000000001
they at best they're like slightly

5411.199 --> 5414.48
nudged

5412.4 --> 5415.92
when approaching this alleged apparent

5414.48 --> 5417.199
horizon

5415.92 --> 5419.36
right

5417.199 --> 5420.48
that's it

5419.36 --> 5423.12
they're not

5420.48 --> 5426.4
bent with terrestrial refraction because

5423.12 --> 5428.32
then that sphere the celestial sphere we

5426.4 --> 5431.36
see rotating and all that

5428.32 --> 5433.36
it would not behave like a consistent

5431.36 --> 5435.28
rotating sphere if it was being

5433.36 --> 5436.5599999999995
subjected to rough terrestrial

5435.28 --> 5438.639
refraction

5436.56 --> 5441.1990000000005
so it isn't

5438.639 --> 5443.04
anybody that claims it is just literally

5441.199 --> 5447.96
doesn't understand what terrestrial

5443.04 --> 5447.96
refraction even presupposedly is

5448.8 --> 5451.360000000001
it can't

5458.08 --> 5464.96
i mean it would turn into well the the

5461.6 --> 5466.400000000001
sheet of star effect

5464.96 --> 5467.44
ironically

5466.4 --> 5469.679
right

5467.44 --> 5472.32
it would turn into that even though it

5469.679 --> 5473.6
isn't if terrestrial refraction would be

5472.32 --> 5476.0
bending the

5473.6 --> 5477.76
the celestial light as well it isn't

5476.0 --> 5479.84
that's not what we see it's very

5477.76 --> 5480.56
blatantly obvious that is not what we

5479.84 --> 5482.96
see

5480.56 --> 5485.84
so it has to just be

5482.96 --> 5487.44
directly on face value excluded from

5485.84 --> 5491.84
being part of terrestrial refraction

5487.44 --> 5491.839999999999
because it's blatantly not happening

5492.32 --> 5498.96
the celestial lights are not taking part

5495.76 --> 5501.12
of the giant warping of the horizon

5498.96 --> 5504.32
miraging it up because of terrestrial

5501.12 --> 5505.76
refraction it's not taking part of that

5504.32 --> 5508.96
because

5505.76 --> 5510.96
then what we see would not seem like an

5508.96 --> 5514.28
apparent sphere

5510.96 --> 5514.28
and it does

5519.199 --> 5523.599999999999
times in a day where it looks transfer

5520.88 --> 5525.679
yeah i know it's weird isn't it or you

5523.6 --> 5530.4400000000005
just see

5525.679 --> 5530.4400000000005
blue where shadow should be

5532.08 --> 5535.88
is very odd i know

5561.76 --> 5567.6
yeah okay i just wait no the moon

5564.719 --> 5569.199
holograms that have features doesn't

5567.6 --> 5572.56
imply that it's physical it's still a

5569.199 --> 5575.839999999999
hologram you can make illusions of

5572.56 --> 5575.84
shapes with light

5577.12 --> 5581.12
that doesn't make it physical it's just

5578.96 --> 5583.92
like if you draw something that looks

5581.12 --> 5585.76
really 3d right

5583.92 --> 5588.08
and you're like i'm going to grab it

5585.76 --> 5590.88
well guess what it's still flat it's

5588.08 --> 5593.12
still just an illusion on that paper

5590.88 --> 5596.4800000000005
just because it seems really physical

5593.12 --> 5598.4
doesn't mean that it actually is

5596.48 --> 5601.959999999999
in that sense in that sense of the

5598.4 --> 5601.96
impression of it

5604.8 --> 5609.92
so just because the moon is

5606.88 --> 5612.4800000000005
like naturally misleading

5609.92 --> 5613.92
plays into physicality assumption bias

5612.48 --> 5616.48
by just

5613.92 --> 5620.4
showing you like it has

5616.48 --> 5623.36
crater shadows as it's been called

5620.4 --> 5625.199
it's all very suggestive of physicality

5623.36 --> 5627.5199999999995
right and

5625.199 --> 5629.759999999999
but it isn't though

5627.52 --> 5632.4800000000005
it isn't physical

5629.76 --> 5636.159000000001
it's a hologram

5632.48 --> 5638.4
naturally spawned non-local

5636.159 --> 5642.679
as a part of nature so part of the

5638.4 --> 5642.679
design of this realm

5650.88 --> 5653.92
the moon and sun are being refracted

5652.56 --> 5656.400000000001
yeah but

5653.92 --> 5659.84
but makes no sense like bear when they

5656.4 --> 5662.239
say that it makes absolutely no sense

5659.84 --> 5662.2390000000005
because

5662.639 --> 5666.0
it's not

5664.08 --> 5668.719
if it were

5666.0 --> 5671.12
then it wouldn't behave like an

5668.719 --> 5674.32
apparent sphere surrounding you it's

5671.12 --> 5675.84
like breaking the whole thing again

5674.32 --> 5677.679
if they just say no everything is

5675.84 --> 5680.639
refreshed oh that means that you just

5677.679 --> 5683.119
broke your own [ __ ] again

5680.639 --> 5685.52
like completely like it's

5683.119 --> 5687.92
it's not gonna fix it just by bashing it

5685.52 --> 5690.320000000001
in a very specific way it's not gonna

5687.92 --> 5693.679
fix the situation it's just gonna break

5690.32 --> 5696.96
it more it's more cracks going to a bear

5693.679 --> 5696.96
if you keep doing that

5698.239 --> 5704.718999999999
terrestrial refraction has to within the

5701.28 --> 5707.28
machination apply to terror

5704.719 --> 5709.08
the earth only

5707.28 --> 5712.719
right that's why it's not

5709.08 --> 5715.119
universal spherical refraction no it's

5712.719 --> 5718.0
terrestrial refraction

5715.119 --> 5720.5599999999995
specifically applying to the earth

5718.0 --> 5723.119
not universal

5720.56 --> 5725.119000000001
because then nothing works anymore then

5723.119 --> 5727.28
it's all gone to [ __ ] it's all it should

5725.119 --> 5728.96
all be worked if it applies to all that

5727.28 --> 5731.5199999999995
all should be warped

5728.96 --> 5733.36
and the celestial sphere that we get to

5731.52 --> 5737.119000000001
see the way it is

5733.36 --> 5739.28
wouldn't be visible the way it is

5737.119 --> 5741.04
and it is

5739.28 --> 5743.679
immediately

5741.04 --> 5746.239
that just undoes the entire notion that

5743.679 --> 5748.4
everything is refracted like that

5746.239 --> 5750.718999999999
it is terrestrial refraction for a

5748.4 --> 5750.719
reason

5753.52 --> 5758.2390000000005
the presupposed machination that is

5756.4 --> 5760.08
because it isn't there is no terrestrial

5758.239 --> 5761.678999999999
refraction it's flat

5760.08 --> 5765.44
it's just flat and terrestrial

5761.679 --> 5765.4400000000005
refraction is the last ditch

5765.679 --> 5771.84
excuse to keep imagining that it's a

5768.4 --> 5771.839999999999
ball after all

5789.679 --> 5794.4800000000005
yeah gadget it's very strange you never

5791.84 --> 5797.119000000001
see this far side of the moon yeah just

5794.48 --> 5799.839999999999
like it's really strange

5797.119 --> 5799.839999999999
that

5801.6 --> 5806.56
that remember that example of the

5803.6 --> 5808.639
apparent 3d image that you can draw very

5806.56 --> 5811.679
suggestive yeah it's very strange that

5808.639 --> 5815.04
you can't see the other side of that

5811.679 --> 5817.52
apparent 3d object

5815.04 --> 5819.44
that is drawn on a

5817.52 --> 5821.84
2d surface

5819.44 --> 5824.799999999999
it doesn't have another side it's just a

5821.84 --> 5827.679
suggestive image that your mind turns

5824.8 --> 5830.639
into 3d it isn't actually it doesn't

5827.679 --> 5830.639
have another side

5831.52 --> 5834.0
it's just

5834.08 --> 5840.159
yeah a projection a hologram it is

5837.119 --> 5842.799999999999
probably effectively 2d within the

5840.159 --> 5845.119
appearance of it right

5842.8 --> 5847.52
but it's not local

5845.119 --> 5849.36
you can't get around it and look at it

5847.52 --> 5851.92
from the other side even you can't even

5849.36 --> 5855.839999999999
do that so

5851.92 --> 5857.6
you're only going to see that image

5855.84 --> 5860.56
from the one

5857.6 --> 5862.56
apparent perspective from that one angle

5860.56 --> 5864.8
because that is how the image how the

5862.56 --> 5867.8
hologram is

5864.8 --> 5867.8
manifested

5870.48 --> 5875.759999999999
is the celestial sphere actually flat

5872.639 --> 5875.76
like the ceiling no

5876.32 --> 5881.28
no it's not i addressed that earlier

5878.4 --> 5884.638999999999
very elaborately

5881.28 --> 5887.599999999999
it isn't anything it's not a shape it's

5884.639 --> 5889.76
only an apparent sphere

5887.6 --> 5894.56
none of these things are in any actual

5889.76 --> 5897.679
positions anywhere anyway in any form

5894.56 --> 5900.8
they're all just an apparent sphere at a

5897.679 --> 5902.4
set apparent distance below slightly

5900.8 --> 5904.639
varying perhaps

5902.4 --> 5905.5199999999995
based on the conditions

5904.639 --> 5907.679
of

5905.52 --> 5910.159000000001
where it's manifesting and shining

5907.679 --> 5912.56
through to you

5910.159 --> 5915.44
but they are not positioned

5912.56 --> 5918.719
none of them have euclidean positions

5915.44 --> 5921.44
they are not a sheet over a flat earth

5918.719 --> 5923.84
they are not actually a sphere that only

5921.44 --> 5926.159
surrounds you

5923.84 --> 5928.4800000000005
none of it is in any position

5926.159 --> 5928.48
ever

5929.44 --> 5935.28
there's only apparent positions which

5931.92 --> 5938.96
are angular in relation to the observer

5935.28 --> 5941.5199999999995
and even if another observer is then

5938.96 --> 5943.92
like a thousand miles away

5941.52 --> 5946.56
it's still going to seem the same

5943.92 --> 5948.88
apparent type distance to them in

5946.56 --> 5951.119000000001
relation to the first viewer

5948.88 --> 5954.32
because none of the celestials are in

5951.119 --> 5956.96
actual places only apparent

5954.32 --> 5958.239
seeming places in relation to the

5956.96 --> 5960.719
observer

5958.239 --> 5962.159
and the only data you gather

5960.719 --> 5964.08
is well

5962.159 --> 5967.4
luminosity

5964.08 --> 5967.4
and angle

5972.48 --> 5975.119
that's it

5974.239 --> 5978.839999999999
that's

5975.119 --> 5978.839999999999
that's what it is

5991.44 --> 5998.799999999999
keep fantasizing gadgets inspector

5994.8 --> 5998.8
ridiculous meteor [ __ ]

6003.84 --> 6008.56
dude if meteor supposedly hit the moon

6006.32 --> 6012.799999999999
then why didn't

6008.56 --> 6015.04
the apollo crew bring back meteors

6012.8 --> 6017.6
i mean

6015.04 --> 6018.719
what's stopping them right just get a

6017.6 --> 6020.400000000001
meteor

6018.719 --> 6022.88
it's not going to be evaporated the

6020.4 --> 6023.839999999999
whole place is just dust anyway

6022.88 --> 6026.639
so there's

6023.84 --> 6029.76
there would have to be meteors on the

6026.639 --> 6031.1990000000005
moon they would have to find them

6029.76 --> 6034.08
well the only thing they brought back

6031.199 --> 6037.839999999999
was a petrified wood

6034.08 --> 6037.84
so and some dust

6050.159 --> 6054.638999999999
do celestial objects follow different

6052.159 --> 6056.5599999999995
set of they don't follow

6054.639 --> 6059.679
physics rules

6056.56 --> 6061.6
and they're not objects

6059.679 --> 6064.2390000000005
to call them an object is already

6061.6 --> 6067.76
playing into physicality assumption bias

6064.239 --> 6070.08
steamy traveler but just lights

6067.76 --> 6073.119000000001
celestial lights they don't have a

6070.08 --> 6075.6
position they don't have physics

6073.119 --> 6078.159
to them they're not physical they don't

6075.6 --> 6079.360000000001
have actual positions

6078.159 --> 6080.719
they're just

6079.36 --> 6084.159
energy

6080.719 --> 6086.719
like manifesting somehow

6084.159 --> 6086.719
some way

6088.32 --> 6093.92
it's very mysterious

6091.199 --> 6096.879999999999
but they're not physical physics doesn't

6093.92 --> 6099.92
apply like that unless you get into like

6096.88 --> 6103.28
holographics as a subcategory right it's

6099.92 --> 6103.28
probably more optics

6104.48 --> 6108.879999999999
right so like ho is light physical well

6107.36 --> 6112.719
ask

6108.88 --> 6114.4800000000005
yeah a physics optics expert

6112.719 --> 6117.44
and then he'll probably

6114.48 --> 6119.36
pull you right into heliocentrism

6117.44 --> 6121.44
nonsense

6119.36 --> 6124.5599999999995
theoretical physics [ __ ] there's

6121.44 --> 6125.44
very great likelihood that would happen

6124.56 --> 6128.0
right

6125.44 --> 6129.919999999999
so it is kind of a field that

6128.0 --> 6131.36
i think has to be

6129.92 --> 6134.159
redefined

6131.36 --> 6136.32
because it's been polluted too much with

6134.159 --> 6139.28
presuppositional mechanics that are

6136.32 --> 6139.28
absolutely wrong

6140.48 --> 6145.5199999999995
in so many ways it's

6142.48 --> 6145.5199999999995
hard to keep track

6147.6 --> 6151.6
no

6148.639 --> 6154.639
no no steamy traveler none of the

6151.6 --> 6155.6
celestial objects are physical zero none

6154.639 --> 6157.84
of them

6155.6 --> 6160.159000000001
whatever meteors are they have nothing

6157.84 --> 6160.96
to do

6160.159 --> 6162.799999999999
with

6160.96 --> 6165.52
the celestial lights

6162.8 --> 6168.320000000001
there's no relation

6165.52 --> 6171.040000000001
i'm not even sure like how that works

6168.32 --> 6173.119
like why where are they coming from they

6171.04 --> 6175.679
just don't relate

6173.119 --> 6179.239
piss off sean

6175.679 --> 6179.2390000000005
they don't relate

6196.159 --> 6202.32
yeah no [ __ ] bobby steels

6199.04 --> 6206.159
retro reflectors yeah there's no retro

6202.32 --> 6207.92
reflectors there's no moon landing

6206.159 --> 6211.119
there's no physical object there's not

6207.92 --> 6211.119
even a location

6211.36 --> 6216.0
and there's no freaking moon signal

6213.36 --> 6218.639
rebounds either to even suggest that it

6216.0 --> 6221.36
is physical just a bunch of lying

6218.639 --> 6222.4800000000005
scumbags

6221.36 --> 6225.28
that just

6222.48 --> 6227.28
have to religiously reinforce that it's

6225.28 --> 6230.239
possible without actual proof because

6227.28 --> 6232.88
they're just straight forward lying

6230.239 --> 6234.638999999999
deceiving scumbags

6232.88 --> 6238.32
that are so invested in their religion

6234.639 --> 6240.8
that they sell their soul to the devil

6238.32 --> 6243.599999999999
for it

6240.8 --> 6246.56
they will lie to no end

6243.6 --> 6250.52
to any length to reinforce what they

6246.56 --> 6250.52
know is a lie

6255.81 --> 6264.39
[Music]

6267.1 --> 6270.539000000001
[Music]

6272.56 --> 6278.080000000001
yeah it's all very nice bible this my

6275.28 --> 6281.199
bulldog yeah yeah it's all very cute

6278.08 --> 6283.84
except it's not local

6281.199 --> 6285.919999999999
yeah all these solo luminescence all

6283.84 --> 6288.639
these special boy effects oh look at

6285.92 --> 6292.0
what we've made in our device that's so

6288.639 --> 6295.119
cute yeah none of them come even close

6292.0 --> 6298.88
to the concept of non-local

6295.119 --> 6300.88
hologram non-local yeah we know we can

6298.88 --> 6303.119
create a little light with a vacuum it's

6300.88 --> 6305.119
all very fascinating

6303.119 --> 6307.28
it's not non-local

6305.119 --> 6308.88
it's local it's a local effect you can

6307.28 --> 6310.48
have a proximity you will see

6308.88 --> 6312.4800000000005
perspective

6310.48 --> 6314.799999999999
angular size change when you approach

6312.48 --> 6317.678999999999
when you go away yeah guess what all

6314.8 --> 6319.28
that all those lights doesn't apply to

6317.679 --> 6322.719
that

6319.28 --> 6325.599999999999
it's not that it's not that it's not

6322.719 --> 6328.0
something you can make with technology

6325.6 --> 6329.4400000000005
here on earth on a small scale at this

6328.0 --> 6331.84
time

6329.44 --> 6335.04
or maybe ever

6331.84 --> 6335.04
it's just not that

6335.76 --> 6342.56
there is no stars in actual positions

6339.52 --> 6344.88
none of them have actual locations it's

6342.56 --> 6348.2390000000005
all holographic

6344.88 --> 6352.28
non-local appearing to be

6348.239 --> 6352.28
not actually being

6370.4 --> 6373.4
what

6375.44 --> 6380.919999999999
that makes no sense what you just said

6377.119 --> 6380.92
there gadgets vector

6409.199 --> 6414.08
so yeah sorry to basically uh

6411.679 --> 6415.76
nip that in the butt psych bear but it's

6414.08 --> 6416.96
not the first time i've heard somebody

6415.76 --> 6419.280000000001
bring that up

6416.96 --> 6423.36
even though benjamin's like oh it's all

6419.28 --> 6425.92
super cute it's just extremely wrong

6423.36 --> 6429.119
it's wrong it's wrong it'll never be

6425.92 --> 6432.719
right nothing related to it will ever

6429.119 --> 6435.679
lead to figuring out what these

6432.719 --> 6439.28
non-local holographic lights we know as

6435.679 --> 6441.04
celestials really are it will never lead

6439.28 --> 6443.44
to that

6441.04 --> 6446.8
ever i promise you

6443.44 --> 6449.5199999999995
arwinian promise

6446.8 --> 6452.96
it's just a diversion

6449.52 --> 6455.280000000001
makes you overlook the non-local nature

6452.96 --> 6456.56
of the celestials that's all it does

6455.28 --> 6458.88
it's just

6456.56 --> 6460.84
another thing to make it a little bit

6458.88 --> 6463.679
more easy for you to

6460.84 --> 6465.679
presuppose a physical nature that's what

6463.679 --> 6468.639
it does it will never

6465.679 --> 6469.679
reveal the nature of the celestial

6468.639 --> 6471.84
lights

6469.679 --> 6471.84
ever

6482.08 --> 6486.0
what do you think the maximum might go

6484.08 --> 6487.84
off earth before the romance i don't

6486.0 --> 6492.159
know

6487.84 --> 6492.159000000001
no idea exactly how big it is

6492.32 --> 6496.84
i mean based on different sorts of data

6494.32 --> 6499.92
i could speculate i

6496.84 --> 6501.360000000001
just just know it has to be a fi it has

6499.92 --> 6504.8
to be finite

6501.36 --> 6508.5599999999995
right it's always going to relate to

6504.8 --> 6511.679
the gradation that we experience here

6508.56 --> 6514.320000000001
the gradient will be the most important

6511.679 --> 6515.84
indicator

6514.32 --> 6518.159
as to what the

6515.84 --> 6519.84
entire size of the realm is the height

6518.159 --> 6524.5199999999995
of it

6519.84 --> 6524.52
find the answer in the gradation

6544.96 --> 6548.8
gadget

6546.239 --> 6550.638999999999
why are you like getting into a deep

6548.8 --> 6555.119000000001
discussion

6550.639 --> 6557.28
process presupposing all that [ __ ]

6555.119 --> 6560.799999999999
what are you talking about there is

6557.28 --> 6562.96
nothing reflecting of the moon

6560.8 --> 6566.08
there is no evidence that you can even

6562.96 --> 6568.719
do anything like that

6566.08 --> 6571.04
the supposed reflector was installed

6568.719 --> 6573.119
after it was claimed that a reflection

6571.04 --> 6575.76
was already made

6573.119 --> 6578.0
it's all horseshit

6575.76 --> 6580.4800000000005
every part of it is horseshit has

6578.0 --> 6582.88
nothing to do with oh it doesn't match

6580.48 --> 6584.0
no just nothing about it is actually

6582.88 --> 6586.639
real

6584.0 --> 6589.52
nothing about it actually happens

6586.639 --> 6591.52
there is no reflection of the moon you

6589.52 --> 6594.080000000001
can't do that

6591.52 --> 6596.2390000000005
there is no evidence that anybody can do

6594.08 --> 6599.36
that that is demonstrable

6596.239 --> 6600.48
without some kind of annoying [ __ ]

6599.36 --> 6602.799999999999
studio

6600.48 --> 6604.799999999999
mock setup

6602.8 --> 6607.28
to just trick you

6604.8 --> 6609.360000000001
bullshitting you lying to your face

6607.28 --> 6611.119
about that actually being the moon

6609.36 --> 6613.598999999999
you're pointing at

6611.119 --> 6615.04
if they even go that far

6613.599 --> 6617.92
i mean on the internet all you can see

6615.04 --> 6621.119
is just videos like oh look

6617.92 --> 6624.32
here's a screen look at the screen oh

6621.119 --> 6626.08
look it says there's a signal bounce

6624.32 --> 6627.84
nothing is actually

6626.08 --> 6629.76
actually revealed and it's just oh look

6627.84 --> 6632.56
there is a signal bounce because the

6629.76 --> 6634.719
screen says it is actually doesn't say

6632.56 --> 6637.04
it's just something there

6634.719 --> 6638.96
and then it is just suggest that is the

6637.04 --> 6641.04
moon signal rebound look the proof is

6638.96 --> 6643.92
right there you can't actually see the

6641.04 --> 6646.32
moon in the video you can actually see

6643.92 --> 6648.0
some kind of

6646.32 --> 6650.08
signal

6648.0 --> 6652.32
system

6650.08 --> 6655.199
that actually proved that there is a

6652.32 --> 6657.84
signal being sent anywhere up there

6655.199 --> 6660.32
right the signal isn't being varied and

6657.84 --> 6664.08
manipulated pointed at the moon pointed

6660.32 --> 6667.04
away because none of the factors that

6664.08 --> 6670.08
would actually even come close to trying

6667.04 --> 6673.36
to prove your case are all missing it's

6670.08 --> 6676.159
all nothing it's all lies

6673.36 --> 6678.88
a [ __ ] readout on the screen doesn't

6676.159 --> 6680.4
prove a moon signal rebounds

6678.88 --> 6682.08
if you don't actually

6680.4 --> 6684.239
change it

6682.08 --> 6685.76
if you don't even see the [ __ ] moon

6684.239 --> 6688.32
in the video

6685.76 --> 6691.280000000001
it's all lies

6688.32 --> 6693.599
everything about it is lies

6691.28 --> 6695.04
i've already said exactly what you would

6693.599 --> 6696.639
need

6695.04 --> 6699.04
to do

6696.639 --> 6701.599
to even get close to trying to prove

6699.04 --> 6704.08
that there is a moon signal bounce

6701.599 --> 6705.599
nobody's ever done it

6704.08 --> 6708.48
nobody

6705.599 --> 6711.679
not a soul has done this

6708.48 --> 6716.08
has made the proper setup to demonstrate

6711.679 --> 6718.4
it not a soul not a soul yeah all you

6716.08 --> 6720.5599999999995
thousands and thousands of heliocentric

6718.4 --> 6722.719
enthusiasts with all your fancy

6720.56 --> 6724.96
expensive equipment well none of you

6722.719 --> 6727.52
have actually done it because you can't

6724.96 --> 6730.639
because you know it doesn't work because

6727.52 --> 6733.280000000001
you know it's a lie and you got all your

6730.639 --> 6735.52
fancy [ __ ] and your special budget and

6733.28 --> 6738.639
your authority

6735.52 --> 6741.599
because of lies that you have to keep

6738.639 --> 6744.56
secret and you have to keep lying

6741.599 --> 6748.0
to keep sucking satan's dick

6744.56 --> 6751.8
for your little bobbles don't you huh

6748.0 --> 6751.8
think i don't know that

6766.48 --> 6771.429999999999
ugh

6768.22 --> 6771.43
[Music]

6783.76 --> 6787.1990000000005
look at that

6785.36 --> 6788.4
it just

6787.199 --> 6791.199
just oh

6788.4 --> 6794.638999999999
it's just like a dream we just move on

6791.199 --> 6796.48
and reassert what's just been utterly

6794.639 --> 6798.8
annihilated

6796.48 --> 6802.0
just move on it never happened just keep

6798.8 --> 6804.159000000001
arguing within the presupposed system

6802.0 --> 6805.679
that's just been disproven just keep

6804.159 --> 6806.4
doing it right

6805.679 --> 6809.599
just

6806.4 --> 6812.159
fall back to your standard [ __ ]

6809.599 --> 6812.159000000001
position

6812.48 --> 6818.119
oh yeah globe oh this is how it works

6848.719 --> 6855.599
okay that's a little ridiculous there

6851.04 --> 6858.8
gadgetness factor but yeah theoretically

6855.599 --> 6861.76
dude all kinds of things could be done

6858.8 --> 6863.599
if it was physical it isn't though

6861.76 --> 6866.8
just like the earth is in the bowl the

6863.599 --> 6866.8
moon is not physical

6867.36 --> 6872.759999999999
so you can't and nobody is going to

6899.679 --> 6904.159
yeah on the level chris and everybody

6901.599 --> 6905.679
has to have one in their family right

6904.159 --> 6909.119
especially with the big there's always

6905.679 --> 6909.119
has to be one in there that

6931.28 --> 6936.04
break two minutes be right back

6973.84 --> 6975.92

7041.8 --> 7045.8
um back

7067.76 --> 7070.84
hello jared

7069.44 --> 7073.839999999999
george

7070.84 --> 7075.4400000000005
tanner i think we got a

7073.84 --> 7079.0
derpcon

7075.44 --> 7079.0
level two

7084.6 --> 7087.709000000001
[Music]

7094.8 --> 7099.360000000001
maybe trick dude [ __ ] off

7097.599 --> 7101.119000000001
why don't you demonstrate something

7099.36 --> 7102.08
anything at all we don't want to hear a

7101.119 --> 7104.159
theory

7102.08 --> 7106.5599999999995
bobby steals we don't want to hear the

7104.159 --> 7109.839999999999
theory of how it's supposed to work we

7106.56 --> 7111.679
want an actual demonstration

7109.84 --> 7114.4800000000005
yeah

7111.679 --> 7117.76
with the with an actual

7114.48 --> 7119.36
bearing and manipulating

7117.76 --> 7120.4800000000005
of what is happening

7119.36 --> 7123.28
yeah

7120.48 --> 7126.32
in inside visibly right

7123.28 --> 7128.32
something that aims at the moon

7126.32 --> 7130.48
that you actually see the moon in the

7128.32 --> 7131.599
sky and then you aim the signal and then

7130.48 --> 7133.839999999999
oh look

7131.599 --> 7135.52
it's aiming correctly now oh look we see

7133.84 --> 7137.28
getting him like

7135.52 --> 7139.52
on the other screen like oh dude see

7137.28 --> 7141.92
there's something rebouncing now and oh

7139.52 --> 7144.2390000000005
look i'm aiming not at it oh signal's

7141.92 --> 7145.52
gone all right even gonna get oh there

7144.239 --> 7149.598999999999
it goes right

7145.52 --> 7151.679
now that's actually a demonstration

7149.599 --> 7154.2390000000005
yeah that's actually demonstrating

7151.679 --> 7156.4800000000005
what's really happening yeah

7154.239 --> 7160.159
there's nothing out there even close to

7156.48 --> 7163.5599999999995
this nothing nothing even close nothing

7160.159 --> 7163.5599999999995
even close

7170.159 --> 7175.28
and then do i need to also remind you

7172.239 --> 7179.28
that it has to be outdoors

7175.28 --> 7181.199
yeah in the actual physical open

7179.28 --> 7184.48
outdoor world

7181.199 --> 7186.239
not in a building

7184.48 --> 7188.718999999999
yeah

7186.239 --> 7192.159
i mean don't walk into a building where

7188.719 --> 7196.56
supposedly this setup is

7192.159 --> 7199.28
you have to know you're outside

7196.56 --> 7200.639
i mean when you go there if you're being

7199.28 --> 7203.04
lured somewhere

7200.639 --> 7205.04
somewhere to get the demonstration be

7203.04 --> 7207.5199999999995
sure that you're actually seeing the

7205.04 --> 7210.239
moon in the sky

7207.52 --> 7213.84
like get roughly the angle of it before

7210.239 --> 7213.839999999999
you go to set site

7214.239 --> 7220.879999999999
right check out if you're not being led

7216.8 --> 7220.88
into some kind of a weird studio

7221.84 --> 7225.119000000001
i mean

7222.88 --> 7227.28
if they even take that level of effort i

7225.119 --> 7230.0
think probably not

7227.28 --> 7230.0
but they could

7230.159 --> 7235.199
the only way to do it is just get the

7232.32 --> 7238.159
machine out in the open

7235.199 --> 7238.159
do it yourself

7238.32 --> 7242.88
and get it on camera get all of it on

7240.239 --> 7244.4
camera get the readout a live readout

7242.88 --> 7248.32
and get

7244.4 --> 7250.879999999999
the actual aiming of the signal

7248.32 --> 7253.599
on camera as you do it

7250.88 --> 7256.08
with the moon visible in the sky so it

7253.599 --> 7258.159000000001
can be established that you are actually

7256.08 --> 7261.36
aiming at the moon and that there is a

7258.159 --> 7262.239
signal exactly the moment you do that

7261.36 --> 7263.598999999999
yeah

7262.239 --> 7268.759999999999
that's

7263.599 --> 7268.76
a real attempt to prove something

7269.52 --> 7275.280000000001
there's no such demonstration out there

7272.88 --> 7276.8
i've already laid down the details of

7275.28 --> 7280.0
how to do this

7276.8 --> 7280.84
what is it three four years ago now i

7280.0 --> 7284.159
lost

7280.84 --> 7287.1990000000005
count it's been a while

7284.159 --> 7289.36
nobody's ever shown me this nobody's

7287.199 --> 7292.0
actually done it

7289.36 --> 7294.5599999999995
nobody it's not because of a lack of

7292.0 --> 7296.56
funding mind you

7294.56 --> 7298.639
i mean some of these guys have so money

7296.56 --> 7300.56
coming out of their ass they could just

7298.639 --> 7301.599
get that

7300.56 --> 7303.92
bought

7301.599 --> 7307.119000000001
the equipment and calibrate it very

7303.92 --> 7308.88
easily probably to them

7307.119 --> 7311.759999999999
because they have no budget problems to

7308.88 --> 7314.32
do that yet they're not

7311.76 --> 7317.320000000001
doing it though

7314.32 --> 7317.32
huh

7328.239 --> 7335.199
the chinese landed a probe on the dark

7330.639 --> 7338.1990000000005
side of the moon yes of course

7335.199 --> 7338.199
sure

7341.92 --> 7348.08
i mean the chinese have like the best

7345.36 --> 7350.88
quality graphics ever man that looks

7348.08 --> 7350.88
super real

7351.52 --> 7355.639
and that's how you know it's fake

7361.0 --> 7364.05
[Music]

7385.84 --> 7388.84
hey

7396.96 --> 7401.84
yeah i'm not gonna

7399.679 --> 7404.719
i'm not even gonna respond to that

7401.84 --> 7406.2390000000005
nonsense seriously

7404.719 --> 7407.92
nobody went to the moon it's not a

7406.239 --> 7410.638999999999
physical place you can go at the

7407.92 --> 7412.08
graphics that they use to demonstrate

7410.639 --> 7414.32
what they've done

7412.08 --> 7417.04
when you actually question it they just

7414.32 --> 7419.36
tell you no no no this is actually a cgi

7417.04 --> 7421.92
representation we didn't

7419.36 --> 7424.239
really get the real footage or it's not

7421.92 --> 7426.56
good enough or we're just not gonna show

7424.239 --> 7430.079
it to you yeah

7426.56 --> 7432.320000000001
it's all a mock setup everything you get

7430.079 --> 7433.84
to see is just

7432.32 --> 7435.679
cgi

7433.84 --> 7437.1990000000005
interpretations

7435.679 --> 7440.4
of what they're doing they're not

7437.199 --> 7443.839999999999
actually showing you anything real

7440.4 --> 7443.839999999999
ever they don't do that

7447.84 --> 7452.079
i think that probably like the apollo

7450.88 --> 7455.119
project

7452.079 --> 7457.04
was the closer to closest to actually

7455.119 --> 7457.92
trying to attempt to show you something

7457.04 --> 7460.48
real

7457.92 --> 7461.84
sort of

7460.48 --> 7463.759999999999
attempt it

7461.84 --> 7465.84
they actually did try now they don't

7463.76 --> 7468.2390000000005
even try that [ __ ] anymore they just got

7465.84 --> 7471.599
it all cgi prepped

7468.239 --> 7474.799999999999
they try to make it look sort of good

7471.599 --> 7477.119000000001
enough for people to go with the story

7474.8 --> 7478.8
based on science fiction movie watching

7477.119 --> 7480.5599999999995
experiences

7478.8 --> 7482.400000000001
and then if they question like hey but

7480.56 --> 7484.159000000001
this is not real right look it looks

7482.4 --> 7486.159
like cgi then it just say yeah but it's

7484.159 --> 7487.92
just a graphics representation it's not

7486.159 --> 7489.839999999999
actually the real thing

7487.92 --> 7492.4
we don't have that footage or it's being

7489.84 --> 7494.2390000000005
processed or we do we didn't think to

7492.4 --> 7497.04
take any real footage

7494.239 --> 7500.0
because we're just doing the cgi yeah

7497.04 --> 7500.0
that's what they do now

7500.56 --> 7507.4400000000005
they don't show you any real footage

7504.239 --> 7510.239
i mean even like the mega corporation

7507.44 --> 7512.4
suppose it launches

7510.239 --> 7514.48
half of that footage is just freaking

7512.4 --> 7517.04
cgi

7514.48 --> 7519.119
like the actual ground based launch they

7517.04 --> 7521.76
just show you cgi

7519.119 --> 7525.44
things that aren't real they don't even

7521.76 --> 7527.599
show you the full launch footage

7525.44 --> 7532.44
based on something real they just

7527.599 --> 7532.4400000000005
graphed cgi right in there

7536.88 --> 7539.1990000000005
right

7539.36 --> 7545.598999999999
elon musk [ __ ] and bezos and all that

7543.28 --> 7549.44
they don't even show you

7545.599 --> 7551.679
the full real picture they graphed cgi

7549.44 --> 7551.678999999999
in

7555.92 --> 7558.719
and they're not even going anywhere

7557.679 --> 7560.4800000000005
basically

7558.719 --> 7563.28
and even with that they're just showing

7560.48 --> 7565.5199999999995
cgi

7563.28 --> 7565.5199999999995
right

7571.28 --> 7575.92
we're good to see you launch yeah you

7573.04 --> 7578.239
see something go away and then go out of

7575.92 --> 7580.4800000000005
sight and drop in the ocean that's what

7578.239 --> 7583.678999999999
you get to see you get nice

7580.48 --> 7585.759999999999
nice little fireworks display

7583.679 --> 7585.76
d

7586.0 --> 7591.199
db ldvr

7588.639 --> 7592.8
yeah nice little fireworks display and

7591.199 --> 7594.48
that's it

7592.8 --> 7597.599
do you get to see

7594.48 --> 7599.919999999999
the rocket re-land

7597.599 --> 7601.599
has anybody actually seen that with

7599.92 --> 7604.719
their own eyes

7601.599 --> 7606.639
like from the public not employees of

7604.719 --> 7609.52
elon musk

7606.639 --> 7611.92
anybody actually seeing that thing

7609.52 --> 7614.4800000000005
happening in the reality with their own

7611.92 --> 7616.8
eyes see the the thing

7614.48 --> 7618.638999999999
go down

7616.8 --> 7621.4400000000005
thrust

7618.639 --> 7625.119
wobble and then let anybody ever

7621.44 --> 7626.5599999999995
actually seen that with their eyes

7625.119 --> 7628.639
ever

7626.56 --> 7633.159000000001
i don't think so all you get to see is

7628.639 --> 7633.159000000001
like oh here goes another rocket

7636.56 --> 7641.320000000001
that's it that's all you get to see

7650.32 --> 7654.0
how did you convince william what the

7652.239 --> 7657.5599999999995
[ __ ] steven traveler what kind of weird

7654.0 --> 7657.56
question is that

7661.04 --> 7664.56
how did they do that

7662.8 --> 7666.079000000001
it's just

7664.56 --> 7668.079000000001
that's

7666.079 --> 7669.92
it's just an acting job

7668.079 --> 7671.679
right

7669.92 --> 7674.56
like oh

7671.679 --> 7679.28
you want to play in this

7674.56 --> 7682.8
claim to be real event that's theatrical

7679.28 --> 7685.04
oh you're a professional actor

7682.8 --> 7687.599
here's your script this is what we want

7685.04 --> 7689.199
you to talk about in between all that

7687.599 --> 7691.84
and this is how we're gonna do it and

7689.199 --> 7695.5199999999995
this is your paycheck

7691.84 --> 7698.159000000001
i mean it's just an actor being hired

7695.52 --> 7702.92
for a stage play

7698.159 --> 7702.92
a magician stage play that's what it is

7715.44 --> 7719.759999999999
right although yeah at the time when it

7717.599 --> 7721.1990000000005
happened i really did hope that they did

7719.76 --> 7723.92
actually send

7721.199 --> 7725.919999999999
shatner all the way up there

7723.92 --> 7728.719
because i yeah

7725.92 --> 7730.32
i thought like wow if that old guy can

7728.719 --> 7731.76
like literally go through that that

7730.32 --> 7733.679
would be an epic

7731.76 --> 7737.76
but yeah in retrospect

7733.679 --> 7738.88
it might have all been completely fake

7737.76 --> 7741.119000000001
that he

7738.88 --> 7743.599
he might have been in a vomit comet or

7741.119 --> 7746.239
something once and that's it and it

7743.599 --> 7748.639
would have been a separate occasion

7746.239 --> 7752.48
and beside that i don't even think that

7748.639 --> 7754.32
he actually even got in a rocket ever

7752.48 --> 7757.04
that's what i think now

7754.32 --> 7758.48
it just keeps looking like that every

7757.04 --> 7761.44
time

7758.48 --> 7763.598999999999
bezos launches it's always the grafted

7761.44 --> 7765.839999999999
in cgi and then you end up just oh

7763.599 --> 7767.52
here's the here's where it landed

7765.84 --> 7769.04
then they go there and it's just

7767.52 --> 7770.88
obviously

7769.04 --> 7773.5199999999995
something

7770.88 --> 7776.400000000001
that hasn't just landed

7773.52 --> 7778.719
like that thing had been placed there

7776.4 --> 7782.159
for a while it's like blatantly obvious

7778.719 --> 7784.2390000000005
that's not a thing that just landed

7782.159 --> 7785.598999999999
and it always looks the same it's always

7784.239 --> 7787.04
like oh everybody comes driving and it's

7785.599 --> 7790.88
just a media

7787.04 --> 7793.199
it's so obviously fake those moments

7790.88 --> 7794.400000000001
it's a media stunt at after that point

7793.199 --> 7797.44
they come out

7794.4 --> 7798.159
and not that thing had not actually gone

7797.44 --> 7800.5599999999995
up

7798.159 --> 7801.92
that's not part of the rocket you even

7800.56 --> 7803.92
saw launching

7801.92 --> 7806.32
from the ground if anybody was there to

7803.92 --> 7808.639
actually live see it

7806.32 --> 7811.5199999999995
i'm sure of it

7808.639 --> 7816.96
that it's just a plant

7811.52 --> 7820.159000000001
they show you a rocket they grafting cgi

7816.96 --> 7822.88
and then they just go to the location

7820.159 --> 7825.92
where the capsule is just installed on

7822.88 --> 7828.2390000000005
the ground and get the people out

7825.92 --> 7830.17
and do the little special moments like

7828.239 --> 7831.36
oh he got back from space oh

7830.17 --> 7834.159
[Music]

7831.36 --> 7836.88
oh so inspiring right it's all fake

7834.159 --> 7836.879999999999
that's fake

7838.0 --> 7843.84
it took me a while before i could like

7840.8 --> 7843.84
see that

7844.88 --> 7849.4400000000005
because at first i thought well maybe it

7847.04 --> 7851.92
is like real it's still put even if it

7849.44 --> 7854.839999999999
was real it's kind of pointless right

7851.92 --> 7857.92
but i thought well maybe it is actually

7854.84 --> 7859.599
real but then just looking at more of

7857.92 --> 7864.079
those types of launch after a while it's

7859.599 --> 7867.360000000001
just like no no that this is not real

7864.079 --> 7867.36
it wouldn't be like this

7867.52 --> 7873.040000000001
this is a fake setup it's a it's a stage

7870.159 --> 7875.44
play it's not actually happening there

7873.04 --> 7877.92
they could have maybe but they're not

7875.44 --> 7879.678999999999
doing it probably to save a lot of money

7877.92 --> 7882.079
they're just faking it

7879.679 --> 7885.84
to cut the prices

7882.079 --> 7885.84
that's what i think they're doing

7888.4 --> 7893.44
you look you can see the tire tracks

7890.56 --> 7895.92
before the parachute yeah well there you

7893.44 --> 7898.879999999999
go that that's our those are like the

7895.92 --> 7901.84
types of things

7898.88 --> 7904.32
that you'll pick up on

7901.84 --> 7906.2390000000005
it's basically very similar to like the

7904.32 --> 7908.32
ancient argument with the moonlanders

7906.239 --> 7910.718999999999
like oh that thing

7908.32 --> 7912.32
just came down and got a final boost

7910.719 --> 7913.599
before landing or it would have just

7912.32 --> 7915.92
crashed right

7913.599 --> 7918.8
where's the freaking blast crater it's

7915.92 --> 7921.599
not there that's like so in your face

7918.8 --> 7924.0
well the with that pod

7921.599 --> 7927.4400000000005
from the basal system

7924.0 --> 7929.76
blue origin systems like it's just

7927.44 --> 7931.598999999999
installed there that doesn't look like

7929.76 --> 7933.599
it just dropped down even with the

7931.599 --> 7934.8
parachute just doesn't look like that at

7933.599 --> 7938.360000000001
all

7934.8 --> 7938.360000000001
nothing like that

7941.679 --> 7948.0
oh yeah yeah the more ridiculous

7944.4 --> 7949.598999999999
questions of course go there do that

7948.0 --> 7951.76
i mean that'll fix

7949.599 --> 7954.4800000000005
that it's all a lie just

7951.76 --> 7957.119000000001
make a funny remark about it

7954.48 --> 7957.119
georgetown

7962.96 --> 7966.88
hey

7964.96 --> 7970.32
guns have never run rmp

7966.88 --> 7970.32
it's been a while good to see you

7980.159 --> 7985.119
whoa we've been going for two hours and

7981.76 --> 7985.119000000001
11 minutes already man

7986.719 --> 7993.599
well it's been a very flat earth rich

7990.88 --> 7996.599
show today lots of subbed in content

7993.599 --> 7996.599
subject

8001.04 --> 8005.96
being busy

8002.8 --> 8005.96
all right

8010.0 --> 8013.8
i hope you're doing well

8033.52 --> 8038.2390000000005
yeah that's right cycle

8035.84 --> 8042.159000000001
yep

8038.239 --> 8044.239
yeah it was very weird that that ever

8042.159 --> 8046.079
even was picked up on

8044.239 --> 8047.5199999999995
it's very interesting though it it

8046.079 --> 8050.5599999999995
really

8047.52 --> 8052.56
breathes life in the concept of that

8050.56 --> 8056.0
like space shuttle and rocket launches

8052.56 --> 8058.4800000000005
especially those were just balloons

8056.0 --> 8060.159
they're just balloons

8058.48 --> 8063.119
pretending to be

8060.159 --> 8063.119
this heavy thing

8063.92 --> 8068.079
but nothing is being launched it was

8065.599 --> 8070.2390000000005
never intended to actually need to

8068.079 --> 8073.239
transport anything because it's just a

8070.239 --> 8073.239
stunt

8083.679 --> 8087.56
but don't be a dominant

8102.719 --> 8108.2390000000005
yo-yo technology yeah now but that one

8105.44 --> 8111.36
rocket

8108.239 --> 8111.36
what is it the the go

8114.8 --> 8118.719
some rocket thing right where it

8116.639 --> 8120.88
supposedly bounces into the dome

8118.719 --> 8122.639
allegedly well it didn't

8120.88 --> 8124.2390000000005
if it would actually be bouncing in

8122.639 --> 8125.52
something even if it was halfway

8124.239 --> 8128.159
flexible

8125.52 --> 8130.320000000001
like say ocean

8128.159 --> 8133.04
on a downward vector

8130.32 --> 8136.0
well if you're hitting anything at that

8133.04 --> 8138.56
speed it's going to completely splatter

8136.0 --> 8141.28
the rocket even if it was like a liquid

8138.56 --> 8143.84
surface if you hit liquid at that

8141.28 --> 8146.079
velocity it's literally like a brick

8143.84 --> 8147.28
wall

8146.079 --> 8149.44
yeah

8147.28 --> 8150.96
it's not gonna push it's not it's just

8149.44 --> 8152.32
gonna

8150.96 --> 8155.199
bang

8152.32 --> 8157.5199999999995
impact shattering

8155.199 --> 8160.799999999999
there will not be footage of how it hit

8157.52 --> 8160.8
the dome it's just gonna be

8162.48 --> 8165.119
that's what you're going to see because

8163.76 --> 8168.0
the whole thing is just going to be

8165.119 --> 8170.32
shattered after hitting anything at that

8168.0 --> 8170.32
speed

8174.719 --> 8182.84
right so yeah the yoyo system

8178.56 --> 8182.84
definitely makes sense to me

8229.04 --> 8232.04
hmm

8237.84 --> 8241.439
all right i think i'm gonna get some

8239.519 --> 8245.0
lunch

8241.439 --> 8245.0
getting kind of hungry

8261.76 --> 8266.399
right but anyway before i do that i'm

8263.92 --> 8267.92
still gonna remind you guys that i am

8266.399 --> 8269.92
kind of in a

8267.92 --> 8272.479
all sort of desperate position right now

8269.92 --> 8274.08
financially it's not that uncommon i

8272.479 --> 8277.84
know

8274.08 --> 8277.84
but uh yeah it is leading to

8278.479 --> 8283.599
a place where i'm literally now having

8280.96 --> 8287.119999999999
to like ration everything because i'm

8283.599 --> 8290.16
just like yeah i'm run out

8287.12 --> 8292.319000000001
money and i really need the support for

8290.16 --> 8293.84
the paypal specifically because that's

8292.319 --> 8296.16
the quickest that's the way i get the

8293.84 --> 8296.16
most

8296.24 --> 8300.319
and then

8297.76 --> 8302.399
yeah i just need a little more to get

8300.319 --> 8304.16

i'll be back tomorrow with flat earth

8385.76 --> 8390.0
early bird number 1279

8388.479 --> 8392.319
back on a monday so it's going to be 1

8390.0 --> 8394.96
p.m amsterdam time or

8392.319 --> 8398.0
somewhere in that vicinity

8394.96 --> 8400.0
start a little late these days

8398.0 --> 8402.319
right curious what weather is going to

8400.0 --> 8403.2
be

8402.319 --> 8406.24
uh

8403.2 --> 8406.240000000002
anything else

8408.88 --> 8414.0
oh yeah clutch you're doing another

8412.319 --> 8417.039999999999
go with the

8414.0 --> 8420.08
cold springs

8417.04 --> 8420.080000000002
yeah i'll check it out

8427.04 --> 8433.319000000001
yeah sorry that's not me actually doing

8429.28 --> 8433.319000000001
a middle finger it was just

8447.04 --> 8452.0
right lots have been discussed today

8449.84 --> 8455.68
think about it

8452.0 --> 8459.12
so yeah reference to symbolic saturn l

8455.68 --> 8461.68
take a look at that

8459.12 --> 8464.319000000001
and yeah if you have any

8461.68 --> 8466.0
reflections or even criticism

8464.319 --> 8468.399
i'd love to hear about it and then

8466.0 --> 8470.479
realize that it is kind of

8468.399 --> 8472.64
based on a mindset that is very

8470.479 --> 8473.679999999998
different from the way i am now it was

8472.64 --> 8475.519999999999
still me

8473.68 --> 8477.28
but i had christ allergies and it was

8475.52 --> 8478.560000000001
like being kind of oppositionally

8477.28 --> 8481.76
defiant

8478.56 --> 8484.24
but still insisted on creating a

8481.76 --> 8487.2
long-term structure and i believe that i

8484.24 --> 8489.68
have done that successfully

8487.2 --> 8491.68
it does mean that i think that symbolics

8489.68 --> 8492.800000000001
theory section should probably be

8491.68 --> 8494.64
rewritten

8492.8 --> 8496.88
not really been able to edit it like the

8494.64 --> 8499.039999999999
editor is broken

8496.88 --> 8501.839999999998
so i can't change anything about it

8499.04 --> 8501.84
anymore

8502.16 --> 8505.359
but

8503.12 --> 8507.28
yeah it's still interesting so do also

8505.359 --> 8510.0
take a look at that if you're interested

8507.28 --> 8513.12
in like spirit mechanics and esoterics

8510.0 --> 8514.399
but from 2006

8513.12 --> 8516.560000000001
yeah

8514.399 --> 8519.358999999999
anyway

8516.56 --> 8523.09
to see you all monday and until the next

8519.359 --> 8538.880000000001
video keep it flat

8523.09 --> 8541.880000000001
[Music]

8538.88 --> 8541.88
so

8541.99 --> 8553.829
[Music]
