92.789 --> 99.869
like yesterday it's low it's actually a

96.06 --> 105.0
little warmer even although look there

99.869 --> 109.32
the distance it's not perfectly blue not

105.0 --> 112.86
cloud so that kind of looked like a few

109.32 --> 119.719
chemtrails it kind of looks like it

112.86 --> 123.689
although yeah it's not everywhere so

119.719 --> 124.649
yeah I'm not seeing any planes dropping

123.689 --> 126.57
any chemtrails

124.649 --> 128.75900000000001
there's one over there it's not it's

126.57 --> 131.64
just leaving a country and so I don't

know but it's still pretty beautiful and

131.64 --> 139.10899999999998
yeah the birds are enjoying this weather

134.579 --> 142.23000000000002
a lot I'm surprised though that there's

139.109 --> 143.88
not as many people walking around as for

142.23 --> 146.72
example yesterday it kind of didn't

143.88 --> 146.72
expect that but

148.95 --> 167.26
but yeah so I got green tea with me

158.4 --> 172.06

213.65 --> 217.09900000000002
starting a little early

217.43 --> 222.389
yeah I just didn't want to wait anymore

219.84 --> 224.459
so yeah I managed to get go to bed

222.389 --> 226.56
pretty early yesterday and was even

224.459 --> 229.709
before to so I'm pretty proud of it and

226.56 --> 234.18
I was a bit Restless at first in the

229.709 --> 238.019
night and I still had a lot of energy

234.18 --> 241.019
but I just had to contain it and it

238.019 --> 245.609
worked and I had yeah great rest in the

241.019 --> 252.659
morning was pretty lovely so I feel very

245.609 --> 255.72
rested got some time to think about

252.659 --> 257.82
everything also then I was pondering on

255.72 --> 261.269
yesterday and come to the conclusion I'm

257.82 --> 265.07
just gonna leave it for a while I've got

261.269 --> 265.07
to figure out a little bit more about it

268.34 --> 273.23999999999995
yeah by the way thank you good servant

270.69 --> 275.9
for the dollar superjet donation thank

273.24 --> 275.90000000000003
you for the nickel

280.05 --> 288.34000000000003
Tom Parker yeah by the way good servant

285.46 --> 293.2
and Tom Parker it was you too right yeah

288.34 --> 295.69
I did see the the show when a flood was

293.2 --> 300.7
it yesterday the day before but I did

295.69 --> 304.99
see it a part of it and yeah it was it

300.7 --> 307.21
was pretty cool that's just that I don't

304.99 --> 309.97
know when when you have a long long

307.21 --> 313.18
conversation with two people you know if

309.97 --> 316.74
you just the whole time without any

313.18 --> 320.89
change just have the screen of two blank

316.74 --> 323.38
icons that's kind of annoying

320.89 --> 325.71999999999997
so if you want to keep this up I'd have

323.38 --> 328.42
like I figure out like another type of

325.72 --> 330.55
background picture even if just some

328.42 --> 334.27000000000004
kind of background picture or slideshows

330.55 --> 337.84000000000003
something don't make it too flashy you

334.27 --> 340.63
know but just just blank icons while

337.84 --> 343.86999999999995
you're talking for a long time that gets

340.63 --> 345.87
kind of dull I know just a tip but I

343.87 --> 351.22
thought it was kind of promising and

345.87 --> 355.48
it's interesting to hear you two talk

351.22 --> 358.0
and the flow is pretty good and yeah it

355.48 --> 360.1
is still it is kind of obvious to me

358.0 --> 366.4
that you guys are in the starting up

360.1 --> 370.09000000000003
face I can feel it but yeah it's yeah

366.4 --> 373.73999999999995
it's promising so keep it up and and

370.09 --> 373.73999999999995
just take it easy you know just

377.45 --> 390.02
so on what channel was that again shout

383.4 --> 390.02
you out was it in your channel good sir

400.389 --> 405.759
no I don't think so oh wait yeah I was

403.33 --> 413.409
yeah so subscribe to good servant and

405.759 --> 418.379
check him out oh you want me to come on

413.409 --> 418.379
ok sure why not

421.91 --> 426.40000000000003
when would that be I hope not too late

437.71 --> 445.27
buffering problems dad mark color I've

443.5 --> 450.94
been having buffering problems with

445.27 --> 454.93
other channels as well it's just I don't

450.94 --> 457.66
know there with I guess that accompany

454.93 --> 461.32
the corona - all its like oh no we want

457.66 --> 464.41
to they now want to more officially

461.32 --> 467.11
narrow down certain types of streams to

464.41 --> 469.87
prioritize the important stream so that

467.11 --> 472.3
everybody can get all the government

469.87 --> 474.36
messages basically I think it might have

472.3 --> 480.16
something to do with that or a pre

474.36 --> 487.41900000000004
precursor of that but I don't know it

480.16 --> 490.5
seems pretty random so far early before

487.419 --> 490.5
my show okay

495.15 --> 501.27
well you know what contact me on skype

498.78 --> 505.30999999999995
and and we work out the details and I'll

501.27 --> 505.31
come on on your show sometime

512.05 --> 522.8489999999999
11 a.m. amsterdam time you mean hmm okay

519.839 --> 526.6
that is potentially doable I guess

522.849 --> 536.0790000000001
especially with me getting up earlier

526.6 --> 538.32
I guess that's doable right okay

536.079 --> 546.779
interesting

538.32 --> 546.779
anyway what I've been doing yesterday oh

548.07 --> 557.23
yeah oh and Benjamin was crushing as

550.87 --> 560.64
usual not too late oh yeah and then

557.23 --> 564.73
apparently the other was just some new

560.64 --> 567.13
was it press presidential government

564.73 --> 569.589
announcement things and the response in

567.13 --> 572.4399999999999
Kiruna and blah blah blah and just

569.589 --> 573.9100000000001
following that just to see like what

572.44 --> 577.72
they were saying how they were saying

573.91 --> 579.9399999999999
and especially Trump I don't know he was

577.72 --> 583.779
very it was fashionably late it seems to

579.94 --> 590.0790000000001
be a new thing I get it I really get

583.779 --> 596.4399999999999
that and yeah he was funny and

590.079 --> 600.399
interesting you know that you had to be

596.44 --> 602.7090000000001
there to get it to see like he was

600.399 --> 604.81
basically just announcing things but it

602.709 --> 607.66
was very obvious that certain things he

604.81 --> 611.01
just didn't really like doing that and

607.66 --> 614.709
he kind of let that shine through and

611.01 --> 617.91
yeah that makes it interesting so anyway

614.709 --> 617.91
that and

621.94 --> 634.0300000000001
oh wait yeah I watched a movie on

625.0 --> 637.21
Netflix all the Netflix but yeah I saw

634.03 --> 641.3199999999999
that movie and had a very freaky

637.21 --> 646.63
realization dark world reflection that

641.32 --> 651.63
yeah that I remembered vividly that was

646.63 --> 651.63
kind of weird which movie wasn't

654.33 --> 665.84
yeah was Jack Reacher was a Tom Cruise

659.55 --> 671.25
movie and it was really interesting and

665.84 --> 674.82
like dark but it I don't know it was it

671.25 --> 678.42
was something else but there were some

674.82 --> 680.19
like really gritty elements to it as

678.42 --> 681.87
well and it made it I don't know I

680.19 --> 686.37
thought the movie was very interesting

681.87 --> 688.83
and I just realized that I had seen like

686.37 --> 690.63
I've been through a scene in that

688.83 --> 693.2700000000001
freaking movie which is like already

690.63 --> 696.11
kind of [ __ ] up from a specific

693.27 --> 700.59
perspective and when I got lost that I

696.11 --> 702.54
didn't know what it was I didn't even

700.59 --> 704.75
know at the time I was experienced the

702.54 --> 709.65
scene of a movie but it it was something

704.75 --> 711.81
he tried to like manipulate me with with

709.65 --> 713.64
that scene in the movie from the eyes of

711.81 --> 716.1899999999999
a certain perspective and the characters

713.64 --> 718.26
basically switched out like their

716.19 --> 721.34
appearance was different but the scenery

718.26 --> 725.76
the setup was to say it's so fascinating

721.34 --> 727.8000000000001
to realize that's like whoa I was that

725.76 --> 730.68
guy in the movie that's crazy

727.8 --> 735.8399999999999
like that that that's just what it was

730.68 --> 739.14
like so bizarre to be me sometimes but

735.84 --> 743.37
yeah it I thought the movie was

739.14 --> 746.55
interesting and it had some like acting

743.37 --> 749.94
oddities to it as well but I didn't mind

746.55 --> 753.92
I I gotta watch that movie again because

749.94 --> 757.7700000000001
it's just it was something else

753.92 --> 762.8399999999999
so an action thriller with some very

757.77 --> 766.98
dark [ __ ] in it but it was also like the

762.84 --> 769.11
character Jack Reacher is like he's

766.98 --> 771.54
supposed to be a mystery but they really

769.11 --> 774.1800000000001
did it kind of well because the guy was

771.54 --> 777.15
freaking awakened the guy who was

774.18 --> 779.3399999999999
paranoid and he freaking knew secrets

777.15 --> 781.04
and he wouldn't tell and he had like

779.34 --> 786.7900000000001
that response dimples

781.04 --> 793.2199999999999
yeah it was awesome anyway anyway yeah

786.79 --> 795.23
it was I thought it was a good movie and

793.22 --> 801.1700000000001
I'm gonna have to watch it again to see

795.23 --> 803.95
if it holds up the second time don't

801.17 --> 803.9499999999999
know when that's gonna be

804.1 --> 811.25
yeah exactly good servant that's the

806.69 --> 812.9300000000001
feeling that I had because he tried to

811.25 --> 816.05
be a good guy but he was just very

812.93 --> 823.4599999999999
paranoid because he was just it was just

816.05 --> 825.4699999999999
do ah and even yeah it's it's almost now

823.46 --> 828.02
I don't want to diss on Tom Cruise but

825.47 --> 832.1600000000001
it was almost like Tom Cruise could not

828.02 --> 836.06
really uphold the character properly

832.16 --> 840.11
although on the other hand he is a

836.06 --> 844.67
really good actor but like the role was

840.11 --> 848.02
so it's so difficult to act

844.67 --> 850.61
oh really awakened this well it's just

848.02 --> 854.4499999999999
because I think Tom I don't know how

850.61 --> 859.46
awakened Tom Cruise is you know I'm not

854.45 --> 862.34
sure he does have issues in his

859.46 --> 865.19
character from what I've gathered so far

862.34 --> 871.01
no not that I've dug into that all that

865.19 --> 872.83
much but yeah he's been joked about for

871.01 --> 876.56
a long time and of course the

872.83 --> 879.83
Scientology you know that's kind of a

876.56 --> 882.3199999999999
big thing same goes for Mike Adams it

879.83 --> 885.0500000000001
the more time progresses the more that

882.32 --> 888.44
seems to have some kind of specific type

885.05 --> 891.3199999999999
of impacts on the people that have done

888.44 --> 893.3000000000001
that like they've been dragged along in

891.32 --> 895.5200000000001
a specific type of a contract and I

893.3 --> 897.74
don't even know if that contract is like

895.52 --> 902.15
on paper or if it's like a spiritual

897.74 --> 903.92
thing it's bizarre but yeah I do think

902.15 --> 906.73
that a lot of Tom Cruise's movies are

903.92 --> 906.7299999999999
just very good

916.18 --> 928.3399999999999
he's like I don't know I wonder what

924.83 --> 930.9200000000001
he's like if he's like really gamma or

928.34 --> 936.5500000000001
something because in the movies he does

930.92 --> 936.55
manage to suppress that very eloquently

937.06 --> 955.6099999999999
and that that is just a very good actor

940.339 --> 957.5600000000001
I think so but anyway right votes go

955.61 --> 960.83
down when you talk about movie

957.56 --> 966.92
in case I didn't notice they don't like

960.83 --> 970.94
me talking about movies why not you know

966.92 --> 973.5799999999999
I see it like this literally you know

970.94 --> 975.5
call me like eh I don't know

973.58 --> 977.1800000000001
grappler maybe a neutral grappler I'm

975.5 --> 978.83
like this okay every time something

977.18 --> 982.6899999999999
happens whether it is ridiculous weather

978.83 --> 986.089
is bad people are gonna do things so I

982.69 --> 988.49
might have just as well just try to make

986.089 --> 991.4300000000001
when people do that into a learning

988.49 --> 994.58
experience like me watching movies is a

991.43 --> 998.63
learning experience too it's not just oh

994.58 --> 1004.7800000000001
I sit there and so awesome and no

998.63 --> 1007.0
because I'm not not starless but I like

1004.78 --> 1011.76
stories and unlike story building and I

1007.0 --> 1015.88
like actors and how they act and and

1011.76 --> 1018.3389999999999
just also yet sometimes the magic of the

1015.88 --> 1021.04
moment and all that it's just yeah

1018.339 --> 1025.81
I'm just I like that but I always have

1021.04 --> 1029.98
and even though a lot of films and

1025.81 --> 1035.74
series are getting like really look kind

1029.98 --> 1038.65
of repulsive or just yeah repulsive is

1035.74 --> 1042.79
pretty much it there's still good good

1038.65 --> 1044.5300000000002
ones out there in between and I don't

1042.79 --> 1048.01
know I think there will worth while

1044.53 --> 1051.8799999999999
watching even just as a study object

1048.01 --> 1054.25
but I don't know it really depends on if

1051.88 --> 1058.9
you if you really have that time on your

1054.25 --> 1061.299
hands because yeah I think that time

1058.9 --> 1063.3700000000001
would be technically better spent just

1061.299 --> 1066.85
working on your farm or your garden if

1063.37 --> 1070.53
you have it especially now and then in

1066.85 --> 1074.4399999999998
the north of the Equator

1070.53 --> 1079.299
it's my country and locked out to caps

1074.44 --> 1082.0
Major Tom no not really it but it is

1079.299 --> 1084.76
sort of it's like some measures are

1082.0 --> 1088.21
being taken but they're like it's just

1084.76 --> 1090.82
details to minimize the spread because

1088.21 --> 1096.01
there's no real containment not really

1090.82 --> 1097.96
and that's yeah I think I don't know

1096.01 --> 1100.03
there's there's a lot of back and forth

1097.96 --> 1105.19
hassle now in the politics I'm not

1100.03 --> 1106.84
following it the UK is okay so what does

1105.19 --> 1109.6000000000001
that mean does that mean that nobody can

1106.84 --> 1112.6499999999999
go outside anymore or do you see is just

1109.6 --> 1112.6499999999999
this is just talk

1119.11 --> 1125.51
so what what what people are being

1122.99 --> 1127.79
arrested for breaking the curfew or

1125.51 --> 1130.429
something you know where's the reports

1127.79 --> 1133.7
I'm not hearing that what I did see

1130.429 --> 1137.21
however yesterday evening was an article

1133.7 --> 1139.19
in the RT that said in France where

1137.21 --> 1143.27
there are lockdown sits just people not

1139.19 --> 1147.0800000000002
giving a [ __ ] they're just like no I

1143.27 --> 1149.059
don't care and they can't really do

1147.08 --> 1151.46
anything about it they're not arresting

1149.059 --> 1153.6789999999999
these people but they are sounding the

1151.46 --> 1157.49
alarm bell like oh but this way it's not

1153.679 --> 1158.95
gonna but yeah there they is just people

1157.49 --> 1162.429
out there that just don't give a [ __ ]

1158.95 --> 1167.69
like what what you're gonna arrest me

1162.429 --> 1170.75
for what for having a cold because they

1167.69 --> 1173.179
already know that with detests the real

1170.75 --> 1174.83
covert 19 tests you know it's all

1173.179 --> 1177.52
waiting waiting waiting procedure

1174.83 --> 1180.4399999999998
because how many people are really

1177.52 --> 1185.45
having the test result that they have it

1180.44 --> 1190.64
no I I don't think I wonder if there's

1185.45 --> 1196.22
going to be a single case or that it's

1190.64 --> 1197.96
just 99% just general Corona type virus

1196.22 --> 1201.26
did the general one that's just

1197.96 --> 1204.799
everywhere you know because that one

1201.26 --> 1206.75
preliminarily shows up on the test its

1204.799 --> 1208.46
do it the deep test that takes a long

1206.75 --> 1210.44
time and all that to really need it

1208.46 --> 1214.28
really figure it out it's way too late

1210.44 --> 1217.8500000000001
anyway that it'll turn out that nobody

1214.28 --> 1223.6399999999999
has it I'll bet you almost nobody or

1217.85 --> 1226.309
literally nobody and I think that

1223.64 --> 1228.89
there's quite a lot of people even

1226.309 --> 1230.45
though they're not constantly on YouTube

1228.89 --> 1232.64
or in the flatterer thing or whatever

1230.45 --> 1236.059
that are just aware of this and I'm just

1232.64 --> 1238.3700000000001
saying like yeah I'm not going along

1236.059 --> 1240.1399999999999
with these stupid games because it's

1238.37 --> 1244.6399999999999
literally a waste of our time

1240.14 --> 1247.13
and well people aren't getting really

1244.64 --> 1250.429
arrested the curfew is not really

1247.13 --> 1254.419
effective it's just a

1250.429 --> 1256.279
a game a suggestion it seems more so far

1254.419 --> 1259.6390000000001
but I don't know that maybe that could

1256.279 --> 1262.07
change well if if it would change then

1259.639 --> 1265.149
it would have to be enforced so our our

1262.07 --> 1269.72
police force is really going to do that

1265.149 --> 1272.2399999999998
or do they know it is kind of like an

1269.72 --> 1274.46
act and they're not gonna do it either

1272.24 --> 1276.85
because they know it's it really is

1274.46 --> 1282.279
ridiculous it's more about a game I

1276.85 --> 1282.279
don't know we'll see

1289.44 --> 1292.1000000000001
yeah

1311.1 --> 1318.149
well you know a hello Amanda you yeah

1314.58 --> 1320.1589999999999
stricter measures you're like what you

1318.149 --> 1323.9089999999999
know I could imagine that if somebody

1320.159 --> 1327.1200000000001
like was just doing their business

1323.909 --> 1327.929
ignoring it and then suddenly out of

1327.12 --> 1330.9289999999999
nowhere

1327.929 --> 1332.759
yeah the coughing fits would just like

1330.929 --> 1336.8700000000001
they would suddenly rush to that

1332.759 --> 1340.5
sickness book that yeah I guess it would

1336.87 --> 1343.7689999999998
be imaginable that such a person would

1340.5 --> 1345.809
then be yeah well I wouldn't want to

1343.769 --> 1347.7
scare anybody but kind of picked up by

1345.809 --> 1352.019
the police and then like okay you need

1347.7 --> 1354.419
to like you're in the middle of its

1352.019 --> 1356.25
gonna spread right as you are now how

1354.419 --> 1358.23
that happens if it's psychosomatically

1356.25 --> 1360.33
or whatever that's another point but

1358.23 --> 1361.799
then I couldn't man you okay somebody's

1360.33 --> 1365.039
like really in the middle of the

1361.799 --> 1366.96
sickness outburst yeah you want to get

1365.039 --> 1373.049
them in home and just let them shake it

1366.96 --> 1377.58
out but beyond that no that's kind of

1373.049 --> 1380.129
ridiculous somebody doesn't have any

1377.58 --> 1384.09
symptoms and they're just perfectly fine

1380.129 --> 1386.1
and now why would you want to forbid

1384.09 --> 1388.4289999999999
them from just doing their daily

1386.1 --> 1388.4289999999999
business

1402.13 --> 1405.3590000000002
[Music]

1419.16 --> 1422.03
all right

1430.12 --> 1437.3799999999999
all right well made your thumb down

1432.65 --> 1437.38
don't start talking like that in my chat

1438.309 --> 1446.21
because yeah virus is fake they look

1443.679 --> 1450.169
yeah I've talked about that before you

1446.21 --> 1451.13
know that you know what I said it's a

1450.169 --> 1453.5800000000002
complex issue

1451.13 --> 1459.8600000000001
there's multi layers and I'm not gonna

1453.58 --> 1462.71
let you just say yeah you're a dumbass

1459.86 --> 1469.52
for doubting the official story about

1462.71 --> 1473.23
viruses okay that's what good servant do

1469.52 --> 1473.23
I feel an awakening what do you mean

1479.96 --> 1487.429
now made you tell me you're a dumbass

1483.85 --> 1489.259
and you're on a timeout although I

1487.429 --> 1491.919
should just ban you because you were a

1489.259 --> 1491.919
soccer gown

1497.18 --> 1502.1000000000001
do I feel like an award what kind of

1499.67 --> 1503.8400000000001
question is that good servant it's it's

1502.1 --> 1507.8899999999999
already happening it's been happening

1503.84 --> 1512.9299999999998
for a long time it's awakening is a

1507.89 --> 1517.0700000000002
gradual process and it's well underway

1512.93 --> 1519.14
very palpably so why why are you asking

1517.07 --> 1523.61
if it's coming no it's here it's been

1519.14 --> 1527.0300000000002
here for a while now it's kind of in its

1523.61 --> 1532.4499999999998
peak sort of at this moment could go

1527.03 --> 1532.45
even further dull depends

1537.84 --> 1546.53
but there's nothing coming it's here

1540.75 --> 1546.53
here now nothing coming it's here now

1578.87 --> 1584.37
well Tom Parker there may be more game

1581.91 --> 1587.91
to come by The Awakening is already here

1584.37 --> 1589.6499999999999
oh hey thank you Amanda young for the

1587.91 --> 1590.13
four dollar superjet donation what pay

1589.65 --> 1595.4
pal

1590.13 --> 1595.4
oh okay check it out

1603.33 --> 1615.299
oh wow

1607.879 --> 1623.9989999999998
thank you Wow again so 20 euros from

1615.299 --> 1627.269
Amanda young you're you're certainly now

1623.999 --> 1629.6100000000001
on my main sponsor list thank you so

1627.269 --> 1640.799
much for the continuous support Amanda

1629.61 --> 1644.2099999999998
young it's amazing it's awesome it's

1640.799 --> 1647.179
really nice it's gonna be very helpful

1644.21 --> 1649.499
mm-hmm

1647.179 --> 1652.679
where was I

1649.499 --> 1656.48
very excited yesterday about new

1652.679 --> 1656.48
discovery what new discovery

1670.019 --> 1673.529
can you be more specific

1678.91 --> 1683.49
[Music]

1680.22 --> 1683.49
James Mason

1702.29 --> 1714.23
the awakening right well yet there's so

1711.83 --> 1719.3799999999999
much to do like I thrive on the

1714.23 --> 1722.96
awakening awakening is what I like to do

1719.38 --> 1725.89
figuring things out and having the

1722.96 --> 1725.89
freedom to do that

1733.52 --> 1741.36
so yeah that does excite me but it also

1736.8 --> 1744.21
worries me sometimes because I know

1741.36 --> 1746.9289999999999
there's another side that makes

1744.21 --> 1746.929
countermoves

1758.33 --> 1765.009
big bright asteroid what are you talking

1761.989 --> 1765.009
about George Sanford

1775.11 --> 1778.07
claimed

1779.95 --> 1784.32
okay so there was a claim of something

1786.18 --> 1791.44
very out of the ordinary I might have

1788.68 --> 1797.26
seen like a planet like Venus or

1791.44 --> 1799.66
something I thought that was two days

1797.26 --> 1803.11
ago I remember seeing that in the early

1799.66 --> 1805.99
morning and even throughout the night

1803.11 --> 1807.85
was that supposedly that I don't know I

1805.99 --> 1813.21
haven't really looked up close

1807.85 --> 1817.06
I haven't zoomed in or anything but I

1813.21 --> 1819.19
don't know you know at this point

1817.06 --> 1821.59
there's so many crazy stories and claims

1819.19 --> 1829.75
about what's out there and I don't know

1821.59 --> 1831.55
anymore but hey I don't know if somebody

1829.75 --> 1835.14
caught something interesting on camera

1831.55 --> 1835.1399999999999
I'd love to take a look at it

1846.37 --> 1860.9899999999998
incoming ok so there's something coming

1849.05 --> 1863.09
oh sure man who knows maybe there's a

1860.99 --> 1865.73
giant comet coming and then all the

1863.09 --> 1869.0
world's gonna [ __ ] their pants cuz like

1865.73 --> 1878.66
oh my god it's the dark omen and the end

1869.0 --> 1881.48
is coming uh who knows I don't know they

1878.66 --> 1887.78
are if they are said to have some pretty

1881.48 --> 1890.39
heavy influences and I don't know could

1887.78 --> 1893.92
potentially be considered a ethereal

1890.39 --> 1902.72
gateway from for some darker influences

1893.92 --> 1906.28
not too sure though and maybe that even

1902.72 --> 1915.05
depends like on the type of Commodore

1906.28 --> 1916.7
the moment I I not yeah I don't know the

1915.05 --> 1919.28
nitty-gritty details of that kind of

1916.7 --> 1921.44
thing what is even said about it I just

1919.28 --> 1927.11
know that comets seem to have this

1921.44 --> 1929.6000000000001
influence somehow and that it is kind of

1927.11 --> 1932.81
sad now if that is a pure rumor that is

1929.6 --> 1934.85
being perpetuated as a mechanism to keep

1932.81 --> 1937.19
the fear in there to keep fear as part

1934.85 --> 1940.31
of the celestial bodies in some way or

1937.19 --> 1945.13
if it's really true I don't know but

1940.31 --> 1947.84
it's kind of thought that when these

1945.13 --> 1949.91
comets are very visible in the sky that

1947.84 --> 1951.9199999999998
that's like a bad omen or like dark

1949.91 --> 1955.94
things happen or something you know but

1951.92 --> 1959.0
that could simply be a rumor that was

1955.94 --> 1961.55
put there on purpose to make people fear

1959.0 --> 1963.5
to like condition them to already go to

1961.55 --> 1967.1
the fear state when it arrives in order

1963.5 --> 1969.11
to achieve something so I don't know but

1967.1 --> 1971.56
who knows I don't know if there's some

1969.11 --> 1975.05
kind of comment coming I don't know man

1971.56 --> 1979.45
ask crowd triple7 he seems to be very

1975.05 --> 1979.45
updated about celestial events like that

1985.369 --> 1988.369
yeah

1994.68 --> 2002.6200000000001
this big asteroid well big asteroid

1997.95 --> 2002.6200000000001
whatever where is it gonna come from

2004.75 --> 2015.77
what's gonna fall from the top or

2007.25 --> 2018.86
something that's I don't know man you

2015.77 --> 2021.29
know what recently especially thinking

2018.86 --> 2023.57
about like the complexity of not really

2021.29 --> 2027.2
not understanding as to the concept of

2023.57 --> 2028.82
meteors even the only way out for me is

2027.2 --> 2031.8500000000001
to basically say ok they are

2028.82 --> 2036.77
artificially created but that is so

2031.85 --> 2039.9499999999998
bizarre it's someone's too much to think

2036.77 --> 2042.71
of that as being a real option so who

2039.95 --> 2044.75
knows if you're gonna take it further

2042.71 --> 2047.8700000000001
and make it into some kind of natural

2044.75 --> 2050.72
phenomena then well maybe this cosmogony

2047.87 --> 2056.12
this realm is much much weirder than we

2050.72 --> 2059.45
can possibly imagine even so what if for

2056.12 --> 2062.929
example yeah this is gonna be a bit

2059.45 --> 2064.399
loopy ok well not necessarily with the

2062.929 --> 2068.57
looping realm it's not involved in this

2064.399 --> 2070.399
but what for example if let's go disk

2068.57 --> 2072.3500000000004
for a moment let's say the earth is a

2070.399 --> 2074.929
disk and there's a dome surrounding it

2072.35 --> 2078.0499999999997
but yeah what is this dome is this dome

2074.929 --> 2082.04
a physical structure that obstructs or

2078.05 --> 2087.3990000000003
is it some kind of odd energy barrier

2082.04 --> 2090.86
and there might be something even beyond

2087.399 --> 2093.3199999999997
because there is no footage for example

2090.86 --> 2095.179
of approach of this Barry it seems to be

2093.32 --> 2098.15
absolutely invisible and there's just

2095.179 --> 2100.4900000000002
other things beyond so far from

2098.15 --> 2102.86
everything that I've seen how reliable

2100.49 --> 2107.6
is that I don't know but it's so far

2102.86 --> 2109.4900000000002
it's just not a single sign of actual

2107.6 --> 2112.7
physical nature like even the

2109.49 --> 2117.1099999999997
suggestions of the electrical effects

2112.7 --> 2120.3799999999997
what is the deal this that weird

2117.11 --> 2122.2400000000002
electrical rain from above so sort of

2120.38 --> 2124.61
the image is like but that must be

2122.24 --> 2127.1899999999996
because of the dome and yeah where is it

2124.61 --> 2128.21
then where's the reflection where's the

2127.19 --> 2130.13
sign of the phase

2128.21 --> 2133.16
thing reflecting lighter there no

2130.13 --> 2135.29
nothing like that so what if there is a

2133.16 --> 2139.339
barrier but it's just like this weird

2135.29 --> 2141.65
energy construct like an energy shit's

2139.339 --> 2142.819
get like almost like a Star Trek energy

2141.65 --> 2146.98
shield this is gonna get it kind of

2142.819 --> 2151.099
weird and what if there is more beyond

2146.98 --> 2153.92
there's just more room beyond the shield

2151.099 --> 2156.8900000000003
maybe it's so much faster and there will

2153.92 --> 2159.829
still be air it's just faster so I say

2156.89 --> 2164.39
like okay there's this snow globe with

2159.829 --> 2166.6400000000003
our realm and outside of it what if it

2164.39 --> 2172.43
were for example in a giant cave

2166.64 --> 2177.109
and there's actually rock and stuff way

2172.43 --> 2181.43
we farther out there and maybe rocks do

2177.109 --> 2183.38
fall off and sometimes they go through

2181.43 --> 2197.99
the energy shield and that's the way

2183.38 --> 2200.21
they come down oh my god yeah I know

2197.99 --> 2204.799
that that took quite some stretch of the

2200.21 --> 2206.299
imagination but yeah you know it's kind

2204.799 --> 2209.18
of tough to figure out some kind of

2206.299 --> 2210.89
natural workings of meteors other than

2209.18 --> 2217.91
that men did all of it

2210.89 --> 2219.95
and yeah it's definitely not just a

2217.91 --> 2222.0789999999997
physical barrier where you could just go

2219.95 --> 2224.4199999999996
like that and touch it and look there's

2222.079 --> 2230.2400000000002
rocks there dropping off it no because

2224.42 --> 2233.9
you can't get past certain point so at

2230.24 --> 2235.339
least that's suggested so what if there

2233.9 --> 2237.29
is an energy shield what if it the

2235.339 --> 2242.21
energy shield prevents things from going

2237.29 --> 2245.0589999999997
out but maybe it doesn't prevent so much

2242.21 --> 2247.369
things from coming in because if it did

2245.059 --> 2250.73
then there would literally be rocks

2247.369 --> 2251.799
piling up on top and then visibly just

2250.73 --> 2256.089
hanging there

2251.799 --> 2256.089
so maybe see

2258.21 --> 2265.2
it's just yeah

2269.359 --> 2273.7999999999997
electrification of our atmosphere what

2274.64 --> 2283.77
know what electrification you mean all

2279.48 --> 2286.7
the radioactivity and all that while

2283.77 --> 2291.72
certain frequencies may have a direct

2286.7 --> 2294.06
physiological influence yes the g5

2291.72 --> 2296.73
secret frequency in the Wi-Fi and all

2294.06 --> 2300.9
that that has a physiological measurable

2296.73 --> 2303.51
effect so that may have a influence but

2300.9 --> 2305.1600000000003
electrification of the atmosphere what's

2303.51 --> 2309.3900000000003
what electrification what are you

2305.16 --> 2311.3689999999997
talking about what are their giant Tesla

2309.39 --> 2315.72
towers being turned on that I haven't

2311.369 --> 2319.579
been notified about so what

2315.72 --> 2319.5789999999997
electrification of the atmosphere

2369.97 --> 2382.1499999999996
disease outbreak since electrification

2373.0 --> 2382.15
what no no a gen that's that's just

2382.359 --> 2389.7799999999997
where do you get this now I'm pretty

2387.38 --> 2392.0
sure disease outbreaks plague and all

2389.78 --> 2394.6600000000003
that that was way before electricity was

2392.0 --> 2394.66
introduced

2427.32 --> 2441.8700000000003
okay hm is that tone to me because yeah

2438.63 --> 2444.9500000000003
this is getting very old it's getting

2441.87 --> 2444.95
very very old

2462.08 --> 2465.8199999999997
are you talking about

2471.06 --> 2478.14
right yep vaccines but there may be

2475.38 --> 2482.7200000000003
direct correlation to the concept of

2478.14 --> 2482.72
vaccines or an ad another application

2483.65 --> 2488.63
yes

2485.47 --> 2488.6299999999997
[Music]

2492.24 --> 2498.72
but yes sickness and all that that did

2495.39 --> 2501.1189999999997
definitely exist before that but it was

2498.72 --> 2503.52
probably more bacterial based and routed

2501.119 --> 2505.73
in just extremely poor hygiene and all

2503.52 --> 2505.73
that

2515.47 --> 2521.2599999999998
and then yeah kind of when those things

2517.72 --> 2523.4199999999996
were sort of solved some the doctors

2521.26 --> 2526.5600000000004
came around like the Western type of

2523.42 --> 2529.33
doctors then that kind of got solved but

2526.56 --> 2532.599
yeah with the start up of vaccines

2529.33 --> 2535.63
there was also introduction of the virus

2532.599 --> 2541.3900000000003
concept kind of or maybe a little bit

2535.63 --> 2543.28
later but every yeah there is a direct

2541.39 --> 2546.2999999999997
correlation it seems every time when

2543.28 --> 2551.05
there's like a public vaccination thing

2546.3 --> 2555.28
going on that yeah there is the disease

2551.05 --> 2557.9100000000003
does does not go away because of it yeah

2555.28 --> 2562.2000000000003
one could argue that it's actually

2557.91 --> 2562.2
spreading because of the vaccines

2575.86 --> 2584.23
right yes AGM I know I know that I've

2581.08 --> 2589.0499999999997
been saying that for a while the fire

2584.23 --> 2593.05
viruses are not invading hostile agents

2589.05 --> 2596.11
they are a secondary cleanup crew that

2593.05 --> 2602.26
as part of the Metabo metabolic cellular

2596.11 --> 2610.63
mechanisms oh I think of all warm

2602.26 --> 2615.0600000000004
blooded species at least most of them so

2610.63 --> 2619.57
they don't literally invade somebody but

2615.06 --> 2621.1
being in proximity may kind of like you

2619.57 --> 2623.44
could say subconsciously or

2621.1 --> 2626.0499999999997
energetically convince another person to

2623.44 --> 2629.44
also go into that mode and start a clean

2626.05 --> 2634.7400000000002
up basically become sick with it and

2629.44 --> 2634.7400000000002
then they will also spawn the viruses

2647.089 --> 2654.819
that does it now Cleary oh really well I

2651.2 --> 2660.95
haven't had a single strike I had one

2654.819 --> 2664.849
like a advertisers doubt thingy one time

2660.95 --> 2667.16
when I had that Corona in the title when

2664.849 --> 2670.759
it literally said like the coronavirus

2667.16 --> 2674.799
spell and uh and that and then yeah and

2670.759 --> 2674.799
that was it that's it

2679.66 --> 2688.8489999999997
hey did I get some new subscribers

2684.109 --> 2693.229
I got 1.7 1k now last time I checked it

2688.849 --> 2695.15
was for one point six eight huh okay

2693.229 --> 2702.6499999999996
seems like I've had a very very very

2695.15 --> 2706.2490000000003
late subscriber update hmm that's nice

2702.65 --> 2708.859
thanks everyone for subscribing glad the

2706.249 --> 2709.8489999999997
number caught up on reality finally it's

2708.859 --> 2713.5389999999998
about damn time

2709.849 --> 2716.869
now YouTube stop maybe you should stop

2713.539 --> 2719.0190000000002
like joking my numbers you know I'm

2716.869 --> 2721.329
gonna keep on going anyway

2719.019 --> 2726.229
I'm still gonna make your precious

2721.329 --> 2729.2000000000003
advertisement money okay Google so why

2726.229 --> 2729.9689999999996
are you choking me you don't need to do

2729.2 --> 2735.8289999999997
this

2729.969 --> 2739.009
I'm absurdly friendly for somebody that

2735.829 --> 2741.92
is basically awakened so you don't need

2739.009 --> 2743.14
to do this [ __ ] stop joking me

2741.92 --> 2746.38
[Music]

2743.14 --> 2749.15
you know anything I even criticized

2746.38 --> 2751.219
concerning Google has never just been

2749.15 --> 2753.7690000000002
like over generalized no it's always

2751.219 --> 2756.259
like these individuals are stupid about

2753.769 --> 2759.6499999999996
this or I don't like this policy because

2756.259 --> 2761.479
of that reason that outcome or you

2759.65 --> 2765.049
should fix this little detail here and

2761.479 --> 2766.16
there or hey are you what are you doing

2765.049 --> 2769.369
are you getting all political

2766.16 --> 2773.029
manipulative but those are not like I

2769.369 --> 2776.239
hate guru no it's basically advice like

2773.029 --> 2778.809
a maybe you should not like blow your

2776.239 --> 2782.739
own company up with stupidity and

2778.809 --> 2786.059
yes maybe maybe this Google or well at

2782.739 --> 2790.509
least the YouTube system is kind of good

2786.059 --> 2794.679
because of the the massive bandwidth

2790.509 --> 2798.099
that is constantly available just the

2794.679 --> 2801.9990000000003
availability of it is just such a a plus

2798.099 --> 2805.2090000000003
point for anything concerning streaming

2801.999 --> 2807.069
platforms and all that so maybe not

2805.209 --> 2812.6989999999996
blowed a freaking company up that would

2807.069 --> 2812.699
be nice anyway stop joking my channel

2812.82 --> 2815.989
[Music]

2824.12 --> 2829.19
YouTube is broken it's great it's not

2826.49 --> 2831.9799999999996
great at all what are you guys being so

2829.19 --> 2834.44
complaining pants about I don't know if

2831.98 --> 2837.53
you've noticed but the the entire Flat

2834.44 --> 2840.77
Earth explosion pretty much came from

2837.53 --> 2843.6800000000003
YouTube okay now it's not only on

2840.77 --> 2845.78
YouTube anymore but still the majority

2843.68 --> 2847.79
is and that's where it all started

2845.78 --> 2850.82
that's where the entire awakening

2847.79 --> 2854.18
process the the preliminary awakening

2850.82 --> 2855.94
all transpired and is all recorded it's

2854.18 --> 2860.23
all out there

2855.94 --> 2863.39
it's like a giant open awakening

2860.23 --> 2867.2
recorded process and that's on YouTube

2863.39 --> 2869.8399999999997
so don't constantly dis on YouTube dis

2867.2 --> 2872.6899999999996
on their stupid policies this on their

2869.84 --> 2874.8500000000004
politicization this on them cocking up

2872.69 --> 2879.35
to social justice warriors and that kind

2874.85 --> 2883.37
of nonsense that is all bad but YouTube

2879.35 --> 2885.02
as a platform especially if it was

2883.37 --> 2889.3599999999997
maintained properly and updated little

2885.02 --> 2889.36
here and there is great

2891.13 --> 2895.57
yes nathan is having a show today

2893.47 --> 2899.77
starting in 15 minutes

2895.57 --> 2899.77
what's that Karen Lee

2907.53 --> 2921.82
now I have 10 minutes I wasn't sure I

2910.87 --> 2926.08
was gonna get to okay another doctor

2921.82 --> 2927.79
discussing the corona virus okay there

2926.08 --> 2932.02
seem to be more and more of those coming

2927.79 --> 2935.08
out these days there's a lot of doctors

2932.02 --> 2938.34
now coming forth with their info on it

2935.08 --> 2938.34
from various angles

2956.119 --> 2962.28
right Jorge Sanford yeah well sorry I'm

2960.6 --> 2966.21
guess you're just gonna have to set your

2962.28 --> 2968.4
alarm clock clock too and then literally

2966.21 --> 2970.2
go to my show because youtube doesn't

2968.4 --> 2973.2000000000003
like to inform people about it even

2970.2 --> 2975.4199999999996
though I'm like really reliably here but

2973.2 --> 2978.45
yeah on the other hand you know do you

2975.42 --> 2980.76
net need to get the notification or is

2978.45 --> 2984.33
it just a matter of like hey it's 2:00

2980.76 --> 2987.03
p.m. M so damn time let's turn on

2984.33 --> 2991.2799999999997
YouTube on Darwin you know because I am

2987.03 --> 2991.28
here every day to PMS to damn time so

3003.8 --> 3010.75
oh right Karen we 5g and sickness yeah

3007.46 --> 3014.54
well they had the physiological

3010.75 --> 3018.08
influence is there it's be definitely

3014.54 --> 3020.93
been measured and and tested and it's

3018.08 --> 3022.19
there I even had a book I still have it

3020.93 --> 3025.5499999999997
by the way I don't know where it is

3022.19 --> 3027.38
though a book wasn't Dutch specifically

3025.55 --> 3030.26
about the dangers of cell phone

3027.38 --> 3034.31
radiation and Wi-Fi that's book that was

3030.26 --> 3037.25
from 2008 I still have it man how that

3034.31 --> 3038.96
book so stands now it's incredible so

3037.25 --> 3041.63
I'd been aware of that for a long time

3038.96 --> 3044.33
that's why even that's pretty much the

3041.63 --> 3047.21
reason why I avoid it having a

3044.33 --> 3049.8199999999997
internet-based phone and all that it's

3047.21 --> 3054.56
like no give me the most basic freakin

3049.82 --> 3057.1600000000003
thing you can think of no internet and

3054.56 --> 3057.16
it's all good

3061.56 --> 3069.21
and I and absolutely if I had a choice

3065.88 --> 3073.65
in my own home I would have the internet

3069.21 --> 3079.7400000000002
router not turn on any Wi-Fi absolutely

3073.65 --> 3082.14
not always be shut off like make it hard

3079.74 --> 3086.64
to turn on so there's nothing secretly

3082.14 --> 3089.97
turning that [ __ ] on yeah it gets weird

3086.64 --> 3092.8799999999997
sometimes but but yeah I don't really

3089.97 --> 3095.2799999999997
have a choice in this house but um on

3092.88 --> 3098.76
the other hand fortunately for me the

3095.28 --> 3102.78
router is like literally exactly in the

3098.76 --> 3106.2900000000004
most opposite corner so ya can't get any

3102.78 --> 3108.8700000000003
further away from it and yeah I'm pretty

3106.29 --> 3113.7599999999998
sure I'm surrounded by those damn things

3108.87 --> 3117.12
in this entire flat apartment there must

3113.76 --> 3119.28
be like 10 of them at least in the

3117.12 --> 3122.04
building it's not nice to think of it

3119.28 --> 3125.67
but as long as there's enough distance

3122.04 --> 3127.77
to that and where I sleep it's so good

3125.67 --> 3131.67
because when I sleep that's when I

3127.77 --> 3135.29
wanted yeah I don't know maybe at some

3131.67 --> 3138.2400000000002
point in my life I'll figure out how to

3135.29 --> 3140.19
have like a Faraday cage bed or

3138.24 --> 3144.1099999999997
something I don't know if that would do

3140.19 --> 3144.11
any good it might

3153.2 --> 3158.27
yeah yeah mark color yep you know I

3155.9 --> 3162.92
never bring my mobile phone with me when

3158.27 --> 3165.38
I go out ever unless I specifically need

3162.92 --> 3169.299
it if I'm gonna meet somebody and they

3165.38 --> 3172.339
need to call them up as to be able to

3169.299 --> 3174.29
connect and not get lost then I'll bring

3172.339 --> 3177.549
my mobile phone and if not just don't

3174.29 --> 3177.549
bring it I never do

3185.65 --> 3192.94
also when I call with it even with this

3188.29 --> 3195.36
basic phone I keep it an arm's distance

3192.94 --> 3198.31
away from me at all times

3195.36 --> 3207.73
never cold like this the last time I did

3198.31 --> 3209.7999999999997
that was in 2009 I think and then it

3207.73 --> 3211.72
really then I also started to notice

3209.8 --> 3214.57
that just my ears were getting very

3211.72 --> 3219.04
agitated all the time and it didn't go

3214.57 --> 3222.48
away in that [ __ ] so just like ah I

3219.04 --> 3225.55
gotta stop this I gotta stop it and and

3222.48 --> 3229.3
there's like easy loudspeaker systems

3225.55 --> 3232.0
now like so you can keep your distance

3229.3 --> 3233.5600000000004
and works fine it's just like okay yeah

3232.0 --> 3235.84
you can't have a perfectly private

3233.56 --> 3237.49
conversation anymore so if I'm gonna

3235.84 --> 3240.07
have to Cole I'm gonna have to do it in

3237.49 --> 3242.2
my room behind doors because everybody

3240.07 --> 3244.78
can listen in and don't want that really

3242.2 --> 3246.6099999999997
but yeah I'm not gonna keep that freakin

3244.78 --> 3250.69
thing to my head and and I don't like

3246.61 --> 3253.86
the idea of headphones either this phone

3250.69 --> 3253.86
doesn't even have that option

3261.54 --> 3270.72
yeah I don't think so it might but I

3267.97 --> 3270.72
don't think so

3288.84 --> 3298.38
oh you don't like picking up phones oh

3292.04 --> 3301.23
that's kind of problematic well I don't

3298.38 --> 3304.02
really like picking up phones when it's

3301.23 --> 3307.1
like an inconvenient time which usually

3304.02 --> 3311.34
means that the person doesn't know me

3307.1 --> 3313.5299999999997
right or it's getting in my way and if

3311.34 --> 3317.3900000000003
it's not a no it doesn't have a number

3313.53 --> 3317.3900000000003
then I tend to kind of hang up as well

3320.39 --> 3329.73
but yeah I get troll calls as well these

3323.28 --> 3335.1600000000003
days unfortunately can I call you after

3329.73 --> 3337.77
the show Tom Parker sure why not but for

3335.16 --> 3342.62
what because I will go on the flat earth

3337.77 --> 3342.62
debate right you do realize that

3359.26 --> 3363.9
all right

3361.02 --> 3368.369
well mark color have you ever well maybe

3363.9 --> 3370.53
doesn't work I don't know if if you

3368.369 --> 3373.11
constantly get called up by people and

3370.53 --> 3375.6000000000004
it's just blatantly getting obvious that

3373.11 --> 3378.75
it's not there they're just doing it for

3375.6 --> 3381.45
social calls and if you don't want that

3378.75 --> 3383.55
you got a cat you just got to be super

3381.45 --> 3385.29
blunt and just tell them like I don't

3383.55 --> 3388.01
want to be freaking called on the phone

3385.29 --> 3390.33
all the time it's just like that

3388.01 --> 3392.2200000000003
although yeah I feel really your wife or

3390.33 --> 3397.2
something that may be a little bit more

3392.22 --> 3399.06
difficult but I don't know I don't

3397.2 --> 3404.16
really have people that constantly call

3399.06 --> 3405.81
me up but I do have people that every

3404.16 --> 3409.5499999999997
now and then call me up and then we have

3405.81 --> 3409.5499999999997
incredibly long conversations

3410.06 --> 3413.239
[Music]

3422.09 --> 3428.8900000000003
after Fe D okay well that's gonna be

3425.12 --> 3428.89
roughly in the evening sure why not

3433.839 --> 3442.999
right

3435.88 --> 3442.9990000000003
[Music]

3477.62 --> 3485.72
really the Federal Reserve said that

3482.11 --> 3495.32
what's your where did they say that

3485.72 --> 3497.45
what's the video or to just say it like

3495.32 --> 3501.6800000000003
they literally said that I don't know

3497.45 --> 3505.24
and but it does seem blatantly obvious

3501.68 --> 3508.0099999999998
that the virus situation is being used

3505.24 --> 3510.62
crackdown as I said earlier on the false

3508.01 --> 3512.44
promises financially promise that could

3510.62 --> 3516.29
not be fulfilled and it's like okay

3512.44 --> 3517.55
smash it all down and then see maybe it

3516.29 --> 3524.35
doesn't I don't know how long it'll take

3517.55 --> 3527.9
and then see just how it builds up again

3524.35 --> 3530.36
and then of course new promises are

3527.9 --> 3532.13
going to be made again so you already

3530.36 --> 3533.54
know that all these people that are

3532.13 --> 3535.9700000000003
gonna go along with all those new

3533.54 --> 3539.66
promises are gonna have the same

3535.97 --> 3546.23
situation after a while again all those

3539.66 --> 3548.23
that don't may stay clear yeah I know

3546.23 --> 3550.76
it's extremely over generalized but

3548.23 --> 3553.12
that's roughly what's gonna happen

3550.76 --> 3553.1200000000003
anyway

3558.09 --> 3561.2090000000003
[Music]

3565.34 --> 3575.33
[Music]

3573.01 --> 3583.0600000000004
the CEO said it

3575.33 --> 3586.85
okay that's bizarre what year exactly

3583.06 --> 3592.54
was that recently or was it more like 20

3586.85 --> 3592.54
years ago or was it like 2008

3596.92 --> 3601.51
no Tom Parker I did not

3604.73 --> 3609.4900000000002
I watched five seconds and that was

3607.13 --> 3609.4900000000002
enough

3626.089 --> 3635.369
no James Mason I did not see it like

3631.219 --> 3640.289
every person in the world is now making

3635.369 --> 3643.049
videos about that it's like oh did you

3640.289 --> 3645.809
see this person doing a video about that

3643.049 --> 3649.14
now sorry I didn't really have time as

3645.809 --> 3651.3900000000003
there were like 40 other people also

3649.14 --> 3653.7
having made a video about it that I

3651.39 --> 3658.39
haven't seen yet if you know what I mean

3653.7 --> 3658.39
[Laughter]

3659.989 --> 3664.979
or maybe I did see it you know

3662.16 --> 3668.249
eventually after you see so many videos

3664.979 --> 3671.18
about the same subject it kind of tends

3668.249 --> 3675.4199999999996
to blend into a giant soup of

3671.18 --> 3677.6699999999996
information you know so I can't even

3675.42 --> 3680.489
necessarily distinguish like who said

3677.67 --> 3682.079
exactly what because most of it is kind

3680.489 --> 3684.93
of in the same direction anyway there's

3682.079 --> 3687.7490000000003
nobody really stepping completely

3684.93 --> 3690.8999999999996
outside of this same frequency and just

3687.749 --> 3692.1299999999997
throwing out a serious opposition that's

3690.9 --> 3698.969
completely different that's not

3692.13 --> 3702.719
happening really it's getting just

3698.969 --> 3706.789
pretty obvious really what it is the

3702.719 --> 3706.789
people that can that have eyes to see

3711.079 --> 3719.5190000000002
across them off your to-do list now but

3717.059 --> 3722.009
it's not a to-do I'm not obligated to

3719.519 --> 3724.3489999999997
watch everyone's freaking video about

3722.009 --> 3732.329
the current hype okay thank you very

3724.349 --> 3735.4100000000003
much now if I bump into it I might say

3732.329 --> 3738.509
something about it but it's just every

3735.41 --> 3741.719
freaking person in the world it's making

3738.509 --> 3744.839
some video one way or another about the

3741.719 --> 3747.619
corona and potential 5g in the media is

3744.839 --> 3750.44
hyping it up and it's ya know [ __ ]

3747.619 --> 3754.819
they're not saying it's bad to do that

3750.44 --> 3754.819
no but

3769.9 --> 3775.839
and here I thought the coronavirus was a

3772.359 --> 3779.95
millennial term for a hangover okay more

3775.839 --> 3782.92
color yeah that is kind of a terrible

3779.95 --> 3785.95
joke yeah anyway I think I'm gonna round

3782.92 --> 3789.73
out the show so thanks everyone for

3785.95 --> 3791.4399999999996
coming I hope you like the show if you

3789.73 --> 3792.849
did then please don't forget to Rogen's

3791.44 --> 3794.65
it up and if you haven't already

3792.849 --> 3796.1800000000003
subscribed to my channel hit the bell

3794.65 --> 3797.529
notification so you know when I'm going

3796.18 --> 3800.89
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

3797.529 --> 3803.14
Amsterdam time every day yeah and even

3800.89 --> 3807.339
though notifications don't always work

3803.14 --> 3809.5
if you just show up on YouTube click on

3807.339 --> 3812.369
our win Channel when it is 2:00 p.m.

3809.5 --> 3816.45
after damn time you're pretty sure to

3812.369 --> 3820.809
bump into me after a few refreshes

3816.45 --> 3823.8999999999996
because if I'm right you do see whatever

3820.809 --> 3826.869
is going down life on the main YouTube

3823.9 --> 3829.39
page so if you just keep on refreshing

3826.869 --> 3832.119
it will eventually show up with a live

3829.39 --> 3833.6189999999997
thingy so you can click on me so even if

3832.119 --> 3836.799
the notifications don't work just do

3833.619 --> 3838.2400000000002
that and they'll be alright we'll get

3836.799 --> 3840.609
through this you know if people really

3838.24 --> 3842.2
want to see me they can see me I guess

3840.609 --> 3844.27
YouTube is just forcing everybody to

3842.2 --> 3848.859
take a little bit more effort to do it

3844.27 --> 3852.22
but yeah it'll be worth it trust me so

3848.859 --> 3853.9
anyway please also do support me through
