235.48 --> 238.48

stream went really well got a crazy

252.959 --> 258.4
amount of views very

255.959 --> 264.28000000000003
quickly wonder what that

258.4 --> 264.28
is it's like almost at 400 now it's like

266.88 --> 270.15999999999997
unusual maybe it was because I was

269.32 --> 272.56
making

270.16 --> 276.16
a couple of jokes here and there of a

272.56 --> 279.039
certain order I'm not

276.16 --> 281.96000000000004

279.039 --> 284.0
angry emails or anything or even

281.96 --> 287.15999999999997
comments about it

284.0 --> 289.88
so I'm not sure what's going on but I it

287.16 --> 292.199

just thinking that they can play around

696.399 --> 698.56
with

698.76 --> 704.56
me especially because they think like oh

701.88 --> 707.6

710.0 --> 716.639
with ranches and everybody else can get

713.16 --> 716.639
kicked out as far as I'm

717.959 --> 720.959

repulsed and another side of me starts

856.079 --> 861.88
to Flame up and just

858.44 --> 865.0
like how could I hasten the

861.88 --> 868.759
demise of everything that surrounds this

865.0 --> 871.12
type of person out there how can I haste

868.759 --> 871.12
in their

873.62 --> 878.399
[Music]

875.399 --> 882.72
demise that's what I'm thinking cuz I

878.399 --> 882.72
don't want these people to even be

885.8 --> 891.399
around if you're acting like that you

888.16 --> 895.4399999999999
should be mortifyingly ashamed of

891.399 --> 897.68
yourself and like bash yourself in the

895.44 --> 900.2790000000001
face before you even

897.68 --> 904.3599999999999
consider talking

900.279 --> 906.6
online for everybody to see okay it's

904.36 --> 906.6
that

911.45 --> 917.69
[Music]

927.6 --> 930.6
simple

932.8 --> 936.4799999999999
you don't see many

934.399 --> 938.36
trolls yeah I got to explain what that

936.48 --> 940.6800000000001
means though seeking star water hello by

938.36 --> 943.6800000000001
the way Richard G good to see

940.68 --> 948.4799999999999
you are you just saying that all the

943.68 --> 948.4799999999999
regular people are acting like gossiping

949.04 --> 954.04
[ __ ] the people that you thought

951.36 --> 954.04
weren't

956.72 --> 963.88
trolls is that what you think six star

959.12 --> 963.88
water cuz I wouldn't be

964.09 --> 967.3090000000001
[Music]

967.48 --> 976.04
surprised me splitting off with

972.0 --> 978.48
Nathan has been having a pretty dramatic

976.04 --> 980.36
impact

978.48 --> 985.1990000000001
that's

980.36 --> 985.1990000000001
like I don't think anybody's expected

986.16 --> 991.04
this but it seems like the whole

988.6 --> 995.24
landscape is

991.04 --> 995.24
changing it's what it feels like to

1001.079 --> 1006.88
me and with landscape I mean the people

1004.24 --> 1006.88
and how they're

1007.319 --> 1014.88
acting there's weird things going

1010.199 --> 1017.519
on and I know that there's been like

1014.88 --> 1019.959
giant groups giant groups of people that

1017.519 --> 1022.88
are bigger than our

1019.959 --> 1024.8799999999999
audiences that have been trying to split

1022.88 --> 1028.64
Nathan and me apart

1024.88 --> 1032.8390000000002
and I'm starting to see why because the

1028.64 --> 1034.76
entire es scape of people are changing

1032.839 --> 1038.079
dramatically like

1034.76 --> 1041.559
dramatically since I stepped away

1038.079 --> 1044.1989999999998
there at this point I barely recognize

1041.559 --> 1044.199
anybody

1047.4 --> 1052.88
there

1049.2 --> 1057.1200000000001
like I'm having reservations if I should

1052.88 --> 1057.1200000000001
even show up in the chat

1061.76 --> 1068.24
anymore also because people that I've

1065.039 --> 1072.44
clearly like banned and all

1068.24 --> 1076.039
that they love to go over to fed and

1072.44 --> 1078.52
just hang around there and just feel

1076.039 --> 1080.24
welcome right well I'm not going to ban

1078.52 --> 1082.36
them I would have originally I would

1080.24 --> 1084.679
have done

1082.36 --> 1085.81
that but uh yeah it's none of my

1084.679 --> 1093.17

1178.0 --> 1182.0
except the [ __ ] trolls when I get

1179.76 --> 1183.6
really pissed off and like I don't want

1182.0 --> 1186.83

clear

1233.55 --> 1237.3899999999999
[Music]

1303.0 --> 1306.21
[Music]

1322.2 --> 1327.0
right I don't know what exactly is going

1324.799 --> 1329.44
on with me but recently I've been having

1327.0 --> 1331.2
a lot of flashbacks to like early stage

1329.44 --> 1333.44
Vision

1331.2 --> 1338.2
[ __ ] and I hate

1333.44 --> 1340.919
it I hate all of it I hate my [ __ ]

1338.2 --> 1344.52
Visions because in the beginning I don't

1340.919 --> 1349.2
know exactly how it happened but people

1344.52 --> 1353.4
used abused my Goodwill and my

1349.2 --> 1358.279
navity they really did in a way that is

1353.4 --> 1361.52
surreal and it just hurts a

1358.279 --> 1361.52
lot a

1361.96 --> 1369.72
lot just that my that I I feel so

1367.039 --> 1372.72
incredibly

1369.72 --> 1375.039
manipulated and it was through my dreams

1372.72 --> 1375.039
no

1376.96 --> 1379.96
less

1384.64 --> 1388.3100000000002
are you supposed to learn something from

1386.44 --> 1390.799
it I don't

1388.31 --> 1395.6
[Music]

1390.799 --> 1395.6
know nightmares is usually about

1398.919 --> 1404.6000000000001
confrontation it's something you're

1400.88 --> 1404.6000000000001
ignoring that's getting in your

1406.88 --> 1409.88
face

1423.72 --> 1429.1200000000001
all you you're supposed to learn

1426.2 --> 1432.48
something from every single experience

1429.12 --> 1434.1589999999999
you can ever have Richard G so yeah

1432.48 --> 1437.2
you're supposed to learn something from

1434.159 --> 1439.21
it like absolutely everything else that

1437.2 --> 1444.839
happens ever

1439.21 --> 1444.839
[Music]

1447.44 --> 1451.24
and there's multiple angles to

1451.32 --> 1456.6789999999999
it it's conditional like of your body

1454.96 --> 1458.72
it's like your body in the kind of

1456.679 --> 1461.1200000000001
condition where that's going to

1458.72 --> 1464.159
happen is there something that you've

1461.12 --> 1466.559
been suppressing in your

1464.159 --> 1468.6000000000001
mind because you didn't want to deal

1466.559 --> 1471.84
about it with it and you might have even

1468.6 --> 1474.6789999999999
forgotten about it then especially yeah

1471.84 --> 1477.1589999999999
that's when a nightmare is going to show

1474.679 --> 1480.3600000000001
up or is there

1477.159 --> 1480.3600000000001
something that

1480.559 --> 1487.72
is a situation where you literally can't

1484.48 --> 1492.039
handle it but you think you

1487.72 --> 1492.039
do that also can cause a

1493.44 --> 1498.88
nightmare yeah that's it I literally

1496.44 --> 1503.0
just summarized everything

1498.88 --> 1503.0
like everything that's

1526.679 --> 1529.679
it

1531.88 --> 1536.7990000000002
it's just that for me like thinking back

1534.48 --> 1537.76
to when I was younger was just such a

1536.799 --> 1540.84
[ __ ]

1537.76 --> 1543.679
nightmare why because my parents were

1540.84 --> 1546.6789999999999
just inept

1543.679 --> 1546.679
individualists

demons

1802.799 --> 1807.76
in there in that [ __ ] experience

1805.32 --> 1810.6

2577.96 --> 2584.319
these Global useless

2581.319 --> 2589.8
eaters B

2584.319 --> 2589.8
leftists programmed with insane evil

2592.52 --> 2599.72
ideas we don't want that we don't want

2595.76 --> 2599.7200000000003
communist demonic hords

2605.079 --> 2608.079
here

2610.01 --> 2613.2290000000003
[Music]

2626.839 --> 2630.599
why do the same people get elected

2628.48 --> 2632.04
because the system is utterly corrupt

2630.599 --> 2635.559
and everybody

2632.04 --> 2638.079
just yeah they just steal it every time

2635.559 --> 2638.079
now

2639.8 --> 2646.2000000000003
they rig it they have the ability to rig

2642.2 --> 2646.2
it and they continually use it

2647.64 --> 2654.16
now the saying if elections would matter

2651.28 --> 2657.96
they would make it illegal has finally

2654.16 --> 2657.96
become absolutely

2658.52 --> 2663.44
true cuz they're not even really trying

2661.76 --> 2664.96
to hide anymore that they're just

2663.44 --> 2668.319
stealing the elections they're just

2664.96 --> 2671.2400000000002
stealing it it does they don't care how

2668.319 --> 2674.079
it's like they do whatever is necessary

2671.24 --> 2674.0789999999997
to just take

2677.72 --> 2682.7599999999998
it I mean they'll just take it they'll

2680.76 --> 2684.559
just like oh we counted the ballots oh

2682.76 --> 2688.2400000000002
it's all on camera

2684.559 --> 2691.76
oh that one had too many votes we'll

2688.24 --> 2693.9599999999996
just scratch that all on camera and

2691.76 --> 2696.4
they'll just do it and they'll just take

2693.96 --> 2698.839
it and they'll win it and everybody

2696.4 --> 2701.28
knows they s it and nobody can do

2698.839 --> 2703.48
anything yeah that's where we're at

2701.28 --> 2703.48
right

2704.58 --> 2715.52
[Music]

2712.88 --> 2717.88
now and the voting here is not

2715.52 --> 2720.88
electronic but the people counting it

2717.88 --> 2722.88
are cartel and they just literally

2720.88 --> 2727.88
erased

2722.88 --> 2727.88
votes like provably

2732.359 --> 2739.44
right because the Liberals determine who

2735.64 --> 2742.8799999999997
is neutral and neutral is always liberal

2739.44 --> 2747.2000000000003
so literally they give all neutrality

2742.88 --> 2750.599
power to their side and thereby make the

2747.2 --> 2753.8799999999997
entire thing completely

2750.599 --> 2757.2000000000003
political like everything the judicial

2753.88 --> 2761.079
system whoever checks the neutrality

2757.2 --> 2764.52
people in everything are just [ __ ]

2761.079 --> 2766.8390000000004
political now that's what communist do

2764.52 --> 2769.559
all neutrality that's supposed to be

2766.839 --> 2770.52
there in society to keep things balanced

2769.559 --> 2773.8
and

2770.52 --> 2776.92
honest yeah they all just replace them

2773.8 --> 2778.96
with agents that are highly political

2776.92 --> 2781.44
and they are going to determine what

2778.96 --> 2781.44
neutral

2781.64 --> 2786.52
is and this is what you get of it a

2784.48 --> 2789.839
giant hell hole

2786.52 --> 2793.7599999999998
everybody cast traits their

2789.839 --> 2796.7599999999998
own and people are taught to hate each

2793.76 --> 2796.76
other

2801.24 --> 2804.2799999999997
continually that's what you end up with

2803.319 --> 2806.839
with

2804.28 --> 2810.44
Communism Marxist communism that's why

2806.839 --> 2810.44
it should be abolished

2811.28 --> 2818.48
worldwide like abolished and those who

2814.28 --> 2821.76
don't agree they should be War over it

2818.48 --> 2825.119
to absolutely eradicate it everywhere

2821.76 --> 2829.4
yeah no more Marxism like absolutely

2825.119 --> 2833.0
forbidden to do it on yourself or others

2829.4 --> 2833.0
absolutely forbid

2833.76 --> 2839.2000000000003
It screw it up to penalty of death level

2837.72 --> 2842.3999999999996
if

2839.2 --> 2846.52
necessary it needs to be totally

2842.4 --> 2848.88
eradicated from the spirit of mankind

2846.52 --> 2851.16
so that people don't even remember that

2848.88 --> 2851.1600000000003
it

2851.4 --> 2857.039
existed that's what needs to

lot cuz anything you're going to say

3550.319 --> 3554.839

coward he is weak and a

3618.559 --> 3625.48
coward too vulnerable to peer pressure

3621.799 --> 3626.96
from horrendous people yeah maybe it's

3625.48 --> 3629.44
in his blood it's like yeah if

3626.96 --> 3631.28
somebody's just powerful enough and

3629.44 --> 3632.119
demonic enough you just have to do what

3631.28 --> 3636.88
they

3632.119 --> 3636.88
say yeah could that be

3640.96 --> 3645.57
it this is just a little bit too demonic

3643.839 --> 3651.999
for him to

3645.57 --> 3651.9990000000003
[Music]

3716.72 --> 3720.48
but it's it's because you're you're kind

3719.48 --> 3724.2400000000002
of

3720.48 --> 3727.4
free the problem is is like we're not

3724.24 --> 3729.52
that free there's situations happening

3727.4 --> 3732.039
here and there's heavy psychological

3729.52 --> 3733.799
warfare and you're in the middle of of

3732.039 --> 3735.8390000000004
it whether you like it or not if you

3733.799 --> 3738.0
like to hang around you're in the middle

3735.839 --> 3740.2
of a giant psychological warfare

3738.0 --> 3741.319
struggles like a world war that just

3740.2 --> 3744.64
never

3741.319 --> 3747.0
ends it's what's that is what is here

3744.64 --> 3749.48
it's going to you're going to be in the

3747.0 --> 3749.48
middle of

3750.16 --> 3753.72
that that's what it

3754.119 --> 3762.599
is and your freedom even though it is

3758.68 --> 3762.5989999999997
honest yeah it does cause

3764.279 --> 3769.039
trouble so you got to just be a little

3767.24 --> 3772.3999999999996
bit more

3769.039 --> 3772.4
careful out

3773.359 --> 3777.64

like and just don't get caught to these

3777.64 --> 3784.92
un anti Arwin people just don't have

3780.92 --> 3789.119
don't do that there's so many people out

3784.92 --> 3791.0
here that just have that had that

3789.119 --> 3793.279
tendency like there's a good chance

3791.0 --> 3796.039
akumu virus is going to like be all over

3793.279 --> 3798.52
his comment section now because I told

3796.039 --> 3805.1600000000003
him not to and he has no control over

3798.52 --> 3808.16
his impulses at all because of a certain

3805.16 --> 3808.16
background

3817.68 --> 3823.5589999999997
influence there's just people that just

3819.96 --> 3825.68
like oh well Arwin really hates this guy

3823.559 --> 3828.079
and then they just like oh what I I just

3825.68 --> 3830.279
want to look it up close this is why why

3828.079 --> 3832.1600000000003
this guy and then they're just like oh

3830.279 --> 3834.119
just hang around and be their best

3832.16 --> 3836.0789999999997
friend ever and they're like I don't

3834.119 --> 3840.119

3840.119 --> 3849.319
here never come

3843.039 --> 3849.3190000000004
back yeah you don't have to

3850.599 --> 3855.839
understand if you have this impulse to

3853.24 --> 3859.279
hang around people that I declare

3855.839 --> 3862.64
enemies then you get the hell out of

3859.279 --> 3864.799
here I don't care that you don't

3862.64 --> 3866.68
understand I don't care care if you

3864.799 --> 3870.44
don't feel

3866.68 --> 3872.3999999999996
it I don't care if you have Curiosities

3870.44 --> 3873.92
about my opponent and want to see what

3872.4 --> 3877.52
the fuss is about and you want to get

3873.92 --> 3880.6800000000003
deeper I don't care don't hang around

3877.52 --> 3882.799
with them I don't want to have anything

3880.68 --> 3884.72
to do with those people as far as I'm

3882.799 --> 3888.44
concerned they could be

3884.72 --> 3890.52
erased like digitally and

3888.44 --> 3893.2400000000002
physically and the world would be a

3890.52 --> 3895.599
better place for it I don't care I don't

3893.24 --> 3897.72
want to have any any association

3895.599 --> 3901.3590000000004
whatsoever through

3897.72 --> 3901.359
anyone with those

3901.4 --> 3907.76
people don't go to the gay bar and

3905.16 --> 3909.92
that's final I don't care how curious

3907.76 --> 3909.92
you

3923.079 --> 3926.079
are

3936.559 --> 3943.0
laughing with ploid people yeah I'm sure

3939.319 --> 3945.839
yeah because duper just wants to hang

3943.0 --> 3948.799
around he might not have even realized

3945.839 --> 3948.799
what they were laughing

3953.079 --> 3957.88
at

3954.88 --> 3961.599
I've seen that before like duper is just

3957.88 --> 3963.92
like he wouldn't read the ridicule and

3961.599 --> 3966.76
he'll laugh about something

3963.92 --> 3968.799
else that actually happens and that's in

3966.76 --> 3971.6800000000003
life chats it's very specific to life

3968.799 --> 3974.2
chats yeah where life chats there's

3971.68 --> 3976.48
things that you might read another

3974.2 --> 3979.0
person literally has a filter or

3976.48 --> 3981.839
something like they won't see it yeah

3979.0 --> 3983.799
it's the live chat can be highly

3981.839 --> 3985.799
compartmentalized not everybody gets

3983.799 --> 3990.72
this see the same

3985.799 --> 3993.44
thing yeah that there's an excuse there

3990.72 --> 3995.72
I've seen duper do that like be

3993.44 --> 3998.2400000000002
oblivious to what other people are

3995.72 --> 4001.799
saying I've seen

3998.24 --> 4006.1189999999997
that yeah what's different however is

4001.799 --> 4008.559
when you leave permanent

4006.119 --> 4010.279
comments like in the comment section

4008.559 --> 4012.96
that's a whole another ball game like

4010.279 --> 4015.039
you don't have an excuse there because

4012.96 --> 4017.119
it's permanent

4015.039 --> 4021.6800000000003
everybody gets to see the exact same

4017.119 --> 4021.6800000000003
thing and you can just always read

4026.16 --> 4032.8799999999997
it yeah I know duper does and I'm

4030.079 --> 4035.48
addressing him over it he he thanks for

4032.88 --> 4035.48
bringing that

4038.24 --> 4041.5589999999997

Kum yeah I know he's a real troll duper

4046.76 --> 4051.5200000000004
I'll deal with it you don't I don't need

proof yeah there's a big difference

4062.119 --> 4068.96
though yeah I don't protect the kumu

4064.52 --> 4068.96

it yeah you think that the Navigator

4397.76 --> 4404.4800000000005
explorers out there cared whether people

4401.8 --> 4406.52
believe that if you go far out enough

4404.48 --> 4409.839999999999
that you would go off the edge you think

4406.52 --> 4413.92

retards on land would think and say and

4423.88 --> 4427.08
retards and they're pathetic and they're

4426.32 --> 4429.4
just

4427.08 --> 4432.76
delusional and they're just afraid of

4429.4 --> 4434.48
doing what I do as an Explorer yeah and

4432.76 --> 4437.76
as they were exploring and they were

4434.48 --> 4440.4
risking things and they were finding new

4437.76 --> 4442.0
lands like islands that nobody's ever

4440.4 --> 4443.879999999999
heard of

4442.0 --> 4446.32
Etc

4443.88 --> 4448.4400000000005
yeah I'm not saying that I am an

4446.32 --> 4450.5199999999995
Explorer of islands but I am kind of

4448.44 --> 4452.199
like an interdimensional explore and

4450.52 --> 4455.360000000001
yeah there's only one place you could do

4452.199 --> 4457.678999999999
that and that is right here inside

4455.36 --> 4460.04
yourself it's what I've been doing I've

4457.679 --> 4463.4800000000005
been paying a lot of attention I've

4460.04 --> 4466.679
effectively gone through surreal

4463.48 --> 4468.239
experiences arguably that would be

4466.679 --> 4472.12
called

4468.239 --> 4474.44
schizophrenic and I've actively explored

4472.12 --> 4474.44
that

4476.639 --> 4482.679
experience and mapped it and figured

4479.8 --> 4484.92
things out and I can still explore it

4482.679 --> 4488.159
it's still happening parallel I've had

4484.92 --> 4490.52
an interdimensional time experience that

4488.159 --> 4493.36
is still parallel happening to my

4490.52 --> 4496.159000000001
conscious being right now like I know

4493.36 --> 4499.759999999999
know I know there's another side of

4496.159 --> 4501.879999999999
me that is right there experiencing

4499.76 --> 4505.12
those things that I

4501.88 --> 4507.32
remember from like 20 years ago I know

4505.12 --> 4509.08
it's there I know it's happening I can

4507.32 --> 4512.36
feel when

4509.08 --> 4515.08
certain things of that nature of that

4512.36 --> 4517.12
experience are happening parallel to me

4515.08 --> 4519.36
I can feel them happening on the other

4517.12 --> 4523.92
side and then I like oh wait that was

4519.36 --> 4525.839999999999
that that's that moment that I'm now

4523.92 --> 4530.04
experiencing from the

4525.84 --> 4530.04
timeline that I then all

4530.36 --> 4540.5599999999995
saw all at once in one large

4534.719 --> 4545.159

4548.12 --> 4553.08
is somehow the

4550.12 --> 4555.08
Arbiter oh like oh yeah you believing it

4553.08 --> 4557.679

4555.08 --> 4560.6
something is real or not who the [ __ ] do

4557.679 --> 4563.4

4613.12 --> 4620.76
delusional [ __ ] ugly scumbag little

[ __ ] you got another thing coming you

think I'm going to like stop talking

4631.48 --> 4639.5199999999995
because you didn't believe me dude I'm

4634.88 --> 4643.719
mapping it out I'm figuring it out I'm

4639.52 --> 4648.120000000001
testifying live as to my experience in

4643.719 --> 4651.4
that moment yeah nothing I talk about is

4648.12 --> 4654.5199999999995
just made up or if it is I will preface

4651.4 --> 4657.4
it I'll say let's just imagine this

4654.52 --> 4659.679
thing here yeah now what I'm going to

4657.4 --> 4664.48
say is going to be made

4659.679 --> 4669.36
up yeah when I don't do that it's not

4664.48 --> 4673.879999999999
made up yeah I don't mix it up I

4669.36 --> 4676.679
don't mix the fantasy with the the

4673.88 --> 4681.6
reality I keep them

4676.679 --> 4681.6
apart yeah I do it very

4682.63 --> 4687.0
[Music]

4684.48 --> 4689.839999999999
distinctly I've see you very defensive

4687.0 --> 4693.6
over such ambiguous concept yeah I'm

4689.84 --> 4696.28
just laying the ground I'm just telling

4693.6 --> 4699.2390000000005
you yeah sometimes you need to like

4696.28 --> 4701.199
really bash it into somebody's head with

4699.239 --> 4706.159
a big spiked

4701.199 --> 4706.159
club because they refuse to

4713.76 --> 4720.12
understand so I'm just telling you I

4716.8 --> 4723.28
don't care whether you believe me or not

4720.12 --> 4726.76
I want to make that absolutely

4723.28 --> 4728.239
clear yeah you think I'm telling it for

4726.76 --> 4731.159000000001
the

4728.239 --> 4733.638999999999
audience that just need convincing that

4731.159 --> 4737.759999999999
it's real

4733.639 --> 4743.8
bro I don't have time for that crap yeah

4737.76 --> 4748.679
I'm exploring I don't have time as an

4743.8 --> 4752.4800000000005
Explorer yeah coming

4748.679 --> 4755.159
back like with the Skeptics who don't

4752.48 --> 4758.32
believe I actually left the coast yeah I

4755.159 --> 4758.32
don't have time for that

4758.56 --> 4765.84
crap I'm too busy

4761.84 --> 4765.84
exploring too busy

4769.4 --> 4773.159
testifying yeah thank you for

4775.86 --> 4779.349999999999
[Music]

4781.32 --> 4786.5199999999995
that is the Dark World akin to opening

4784.719 --> 4789.2390000000005
the third

4786.52 --> 4793.639
eye it's

4789.239 --> 4796.839999999999
related it's complicated though

4793.639 --> 4799.1990000000005
I mean it is an entire other form of

4796.84 --> 4802.2390000000005
Consciousness it is arguably the

4799.199 --> 4804.759999999999
subconsciousness that your Consciousness

4802.239 --> 4809.0
gets displaced into your

4804.76 --> 4813.04
subconsciousness is what it probably

4809.0 --> 4816.28
is or something like

4813.04 --> 4818.32
that maybe a sub simulation within the

4816.28 --> 4820.719
subconscious I'm not entirely sure what

4818.32 --> 4822.4
it is but I just know that dark world is

4820.719 --> 4826.08
a completely different type of

4822.4 --> 4826.08
experience a waking

4826.12 --> 4831.5599999999995
world you see

4828.84 --> 4834.84
clearer everything is more

4831.56 --> 4838.52
pristine everything is more real in the

4834.84 --> 4841.04
dark world like a lucid dream is more

4838.52 --> 4843.6
real than

4841.04 --> 4846.32
reality because your senses are less

4843.6 --> 4846.320000000001
obstructed

4849.719 --> 4854.159
somehow why did the US band dis use of

4852.4 --> 4856.04
subl

4854.159 --> 4861.04
messages did

4856.04 --> 4861.04
they I don't know why but they don't

4861.48 --> 4866.5199999999995
work and beside like what are you

4863.679 --> 4869.159
talking about banning subliminal

4866.52 --> 4870.639
messages like they just sto using them

4869.159 --> 4872.638999999999
because they didn't work they don't need

4870.639 --> 4875.08
to do it anymore they just shove it in

4872.639 --> 4877.08
your face now yeah they just shove in

4875.08 --> 4879.36
your face what they want you to believe

4877.08 --> 4881.6
and what they want you to

4879.36 --> 4884.199
like there's no more subliminal they

4881.6 --> 4886.159000000001
don't have to sneak something in they

4884.199 --> 4890.759999999999
just shove it in your face it's like you

4886.159 --> 4895.48
have to like this ha smile like

4890.76 --> 4897.360000000001
it or you'll get isolated and shamed

4895.48 --> 4900.879999999999
yeah that's how they do it now they

4897.36 --> 4900.88
don't need subliminal

4904.239 --> 4908.48
anything I tried to explain that

4911.239 --> 4914.638999999999
yesterday right

4915.52 --> 4921.040000000001
still appreciate see but this Richard G

4918.28 --> 4923.96
you do see why I I love keeping duper

4921.04 --> 4927.96
around right he does ask the question he

4923.96 --> 4931.28
actually asks the questions

4927.96 --> 4934.2390000000005
like anybody I anybody else here asking

4931.28 --> 4935.92
the questions the right questions actual

4934.239 --> 4939.239
curiosity based

4935.92 --> 4941.2390000000005
inquiry I don't see him I see duper

4939.239 --> 4944.28
asking questions I mean it's a maybe

4941.239 --> 4947.32
slightly flimsy but at least he's

4944.28 --> 4951.08
actually asking the questions and that's

4947.32 --> 4951.08
why I protected

4953.639 --> 4960.92
him did he listen no he wasn't there he

4956.679 --> 4960.92
already said so he

4971.56 --> 4974.56
he

4979.159 --> 4984.0
do there are some positives yes but

4981.159 --> 4986.04
those positives are great those

4984.0 --> 4990.08
positives give

4986.04 --> 4990.08
me the proper

4992.28 --> 4996.96
reflection all trolls need to learn yeah

4994.719 --> 5000.04
but if all trolls learn from duper then

4996.96 --> 5000.04
they wouldn't be trolls

5001.48 --> 5004.48
anymore

5007.48 --> 5010.5599999999995
right anyway man it's

5010.92 --> 5015.92
been can't believe I'm already gone over

5013.92 --> 5019.4
an hour and 20 minutes anyway I'm going

5015.92 --> 5021.56
to put Illuminati cisson in the oven and

5019.4 --> 5023.719
turn on my coffee I think I deserved it

5021.56 --> 5023.719
by

5031.48 --> 5034.48
now

5061.36 --> 5064.36

[Music]

5102.0 --> 5110.28

5117.64 --> 5120.759
[Music]

5121.28 --> 5124.28
what

5140.92 --> 5146.2390000000005
it's not banned what is not banned in

5143.04 --> 5146.239
the US what are you talking

5150.0 --> 5156.239
about oh the subliminal message

5152.8 --> 5158.159000000001
right yeah I where do you get that they

5156.239 --> 5160.04
didn't ban it they just stopped using it

5158.159 --> 5163.5599999999995
because doesn't really

5160.04 --> 5166.679
work it's like they've moved on to

5163.56 --> 5171.0
another tier of social

5166.679 --> 5174.32
engineering from a more occulted

5171.0 --> 5176.36
secretive vantage point to just like Hey

5174.32 --> 5178.4
we're going to mind control you do what

5176.36 --> 5181.599999999999
we say or you're going to be in trouble

5178.4 --> 5185.159
yeah that's what they do now yeah it's

5181.6 --> 5188.119000000001
much more overt it's no this like

5185.159 --> 5190.5599999999995
subliminal messages is for when you're

5188.119 --> 5193.679
still trying to keep it a

5190.56 --> 5197.4400000000005
secret you

5193.679 --> 5200.36
know like when it's still criminal to

5197.44 --> 5202.5199999999995
just overtly do that yeah it's not

5200.36 --> 5204.28
criminal anymore they just like hey just

5202.52 --> 5206.280000000001
do what we say or we'll [ __ ] make

5204.28 --> 5209.639
your life miserable

5206.28 --> 5211.679
yeah there not kind of a few steps

5209.639 --> 5213.679
Beyond subliminal messaging you don't

5211.679 --> 5215.1990000000005

5360.92 --> 5363.92
fluffiness

5450.84 --> 5453.84
e

5476.08 --> 5478.639
hey what's

5480.76 --> 5483.76
that

5489.679 --> 5492.4800000000005
sorry that took so

5496.8 --> 5502.96
long like put some hair in my water

5499.8 --> 5506.08
water in my hair because the fluffiness

5502.96 --> 5508.36
was just driving me

5506.08 --> 5510.8
nuts just the hair is just always

5508.36 --> 5513.759999999999
sticking to everything it gets so super

5510.8 --> 5513.76
fluffy

5514.58 --> 5519.84
[Music]

5517.199 --> 5525.159
anyway got my coffee here T

5519.84 --> 5529.360000000001
coffee what is T coffee it's coffee I

5525.159 --> 5532.159
put in the filter with the coffee

5529.36 --> 5535.159
grind put a little

5532.159 --> 5535.159
turmeric

5535.76 --> 5540.84
powder in there like a a little tiny

5538.96 --> 5542.2390000000005
little spoon and it's like already

5540.84 --> 5547.679
premixed

5542.239 --> 5550.959999999999
with six to 1/8 of black

5547.679 --> 5553.639
pepper so it's that's premix that comi

5550.96 --> 5556.199
put a little teaspoon in there like in

5553.639 --> 5560.56
the in the in the filter together with

5556.199 --> 5563.96
the coffee and then just let it get

5560.56 --> 5567.080000000001
through and you get this spicy turmeric

5563.96 --> 5571.2390000000005
coffee which is great like turmeric's

5567.08 --> 5572.96
supposed to be together with pepper and

5571.239 --> 5577.48
coffee like

5572.96 --> 5579.92
those herbs those spices belong together

5577.48 --> 5583.239
and I I believe I have

5579.92 --> 5585.4400000000005
no medical researcher or whatever but I

5583.239 --> 5586.48
believe that they actually complement

5585.44 --> 5589.839999999999
each

5586.48 --> 5592.759999999999
other that the coffee probably helps you

5589.84 --> 5596.08
to absorb the turmeric qualities

5592.76 --> 5599.92
better as does the pepper and that

5596.08 --> 5602.639
coffee has other medicinal influences

5599.92 --> 5605.4
potentially and I think that coffee like

5602.639 --> 5605.400000000001
this is just

5605.96 --> 5611.04
healthier so yeah that's T coffee I

5608.679 --> 5613.0
rarely talk about it anymore at the

5611.04 --> 5615.719
beginning of the Early Bird shows it was

5613.0 --> 5615.719
really like a

5618.28 --> 5625.28
thing you're not a Freemason you're an

5621.52 --> 5625.280000000001
expensive Carpenter that's

5626.08 --> 5633.5599999999995

5682.6 --> 5687.280000000001
your secrets I already know a lot of

5684.8 --> 5690.4800000000005
most the whole point about Freemasonry

5687.28 --> 5692.32
is it's kind of getting outdated not an

5690.48 --> 5694.718999999999
astronaut

5692.32 --> 5698.0
hey if an astronaut Freemason wants to

5694.719 --> 5701.0
show up in in my

5698.0 --> 5705.08
chat by all

5701.0 --> 5707.6
means but uh

5705.08 --> 5710.719
yeah I mean we're going to make fun of

5707.6 --> 5713.1990000000005
him though it's like you're a preas you

5710.719 --> 5715.92
took an oath to keep it in secret that

5713.199 --> 5715.919999999999
space is

5716.119 --> 5721.92
fake yeah we're definitely going to do

5718.96 --> 5727.76
that then right

5721.92 --> 5731.679
but no it's fine Freemasons are welcome

5727.76 --> 5735.8
here to a degree I mean if you're just a

5731.679 --> 5738.679
disgusting aoral creep yeah Freemasons

5735.8 --> 5741.04
are involved in interesting things and

5738.679 --> 5743.52
also in bad things it's not like they're

5741.04 --> 5746.76
all just

5743.52 --> 5748.84
good as we all know as you roll up to

5746.76 --> 5752.360000000001
the top you get to the 32 and then you

5748.84 --> 5755.56
have to do the 33 and then you find out

5752.36 --> 5759.719
it's all worshiping Lucifer sort

5755.56 --> 5762.679
of and that you might get contacted by

5759.719 --> 5765.679
really evil people that are at the top

5762.679 --> 5767.4800000000005
like oh oh yeah we're actually like a

5765.679 --> 5769.36
clan of vampires you want to be a

5767.48 --> 5771.5199999999995
vampire too you'll have a lot of power

5769.36 --> 5774.28
you'll have everything you ever

5771.52 --> 5775.080000000001
need you just have to be a psychopath

5774.28 --> 5778.88
about

5775.08 --> 5780.32
it kind of this is very loose I mean I

5778.88 --> 5782.1990000000005
know that

5780.32 --> 5785.32
happens

5782.199 --> 5786.839999999999
but Freemasons in my opinion are not

5785.32 --> 5790.799999999999
necessarily

5786.84 --> 5792.6
evil but they can be evil yeah just

5790.8 --> 5794.119000000001
because you're a Freemason doesn't mean

5792.6 --> 5796.92
that you're good

5794.119 --> 5801.4
either so you got to be very wary about

5796.92 --> 5804.119
that yeah my grandpa was a Freemason too

5801.4 --> 5804.119
so

5804.159 --> 5813.28
buy and kind of a weird one cuz I never

5809.0 --> 5813.28
met my grandpa that was a Freemason

5813.56 --> 5819.6
he

5816.52 --> 5822.96
like he completely distanced

5819.6 --> 5822.96
himself from

5824.0 --> 5829.6
everybody

5825.96 --> 5833.8
like it was terrible but he abandoned my

5829.6 --> 5836.6
mother and like my grandmother and my

5833.8 --> 5839.639
mother and her sister when she was like

5836.6 --> 5842.56
five and just abandoned them like never

5839.639 --> 5844.84
to be seen again he would still live

5842.56 --> 5848.0
there but he would never visit her never

5844.84 --> 5851.52
talk to her never like complete and

5848.0 --> 5854.159
utter abandonment which is

5851.52 --> 5856.040000000001
horrendous yeah and my mother was

5854.159 --> 5858.719
absolutely traumatized from that it

5856.04 --> 5861.239
[ __ ] her up their entire

5858.719 --> 5862.92
life that daddy issues because of it

5861.239 --> 5865.919999999999
their entire

5862.92 --> 5865.92
life

5866.159 --> 5870.32
terrible like I don't want to go even

5868.4 --> 5872.759999999999
further but it like that had left

5870.32 --> 5875.0
scarring

5872.76 --> 5877.360000000001
and I never met my

5875.0 --> 5880.76
grandpa but I do have some of his

5877.36 --> 5880.759999999999
drawings and he was

5881.32 --> 5887.4
apparently kind of like hiding in the

5883.84 --> 5890.599
Brotherhood it seems it seems like he

5887.4 --> 5892.159
might have been in ways kind of like

5890.599 --> 5894.76
me

5892.159 --> 5897.598999999999
but less

5894.76 --> 5899.0
ferocious and even more frustrated with

5897.599 --> 5901.1990000000005
the world and he might have just like

5899.0 --> 5902.88
kind of like I just want to be a

5901.199 --> 5904.239
Freemason and I don't want to have

5902.88 --> 5906.8
anything to do with the rest of the

5904.239 --> 5910.199
world anymore kind of something like

5906.8 --> 5912.96
that cuz it seemed like it so I don't

5910.199 --> 5916.638999999999
know much about my

5912.96 --> 5920.28
grandpa but I know he wasn't a very good

5916.639 --> 5924.56
man cuz he abandoned my

5920.28 --> 5927.08
mother and my grandma and my aunt so and

5924.56 --> 5930.360000000001
like there's no excuse for it he never

5927.08 --> 5933.119
even tried to justify it it was just

5930.36 --> 5933.119
straight out

5933.32 --> 5939.44
cowardice leaving just cowardice pure

5936.719 --> 5941.119
cowardice unadulterated no excuse for it

5939.44 --> 5944.638999999999
never

5941.119 --> 5945.639
Justified so yeah can't say he was a

5944.639 --> 5948.599
good

5945.639 --> 5951.599
person or a badass or

5948.599 --> 5951.599
anything

5954.239 --> 5958.919999999999
no I don't know anything about his life

5957.36 --> 5963.598999999999
pretty

5958.92 --> 5963.599
much I know he was fascinated with

5963.88 --> 5971.2390000000005
Jews and not like in an evil

5967.44 --> 5973.5599999999995
way probably more like about their like

5971.239 --> 5975.678999999999
the spiritual lineage and all that

5973.56 --> 5976.92
something like that something weird I

5975.679 --> 5979.76
don't know

5976.92 --> 5981.36
man I never spoke to him when as he was

5979.76 --> 5983.92
alive

5981.36 --> 5988.0
so but yeah

5983.92 --> 5994.08
Mason that's fine like his

5988.0 --> 5996.679
large groupies visited us when he died

5994.08 --> 6001.599
cuz believe it or not like the guy was

5996.679 --> 6006.599
like in his 80s he never even told

6001.599 --> 6009.360000000001
anybody like anybody that he even had a

6006.599 --> 6012.88
daughter that daughters too he never

6009.36 --> 6014.48
told his lodge guys ever well maybe

6012.88 --> 6016.92
that's because his lodge guys were kind

6014.48 --> 6018.678999999999
of weird and risky and he might have

6016.92 --> 6021.0
they might be those types that were

6018.679 --> 6024.1990000000005
doing risky things and it's like oh yeah

6021.0 --> 6030.239
we want to experiment on those kids it

6024.199 --> 6032.159
could be it I can't exclude it I do know

6030.239 --> 6035.119
however with quite certainty is that and

6032.159 --> 6035.119
this is around when I

6035.88 --> 6044.719
was is

6038.199 --> 6047.28
it 13 or 14 something Grandpa died and

6044.719 --> 6050.4800000000005
then the lodge found

6047.28 --> 6053.28
out because my mom basically in an

6050.48 --> 6056.718999999999
emotion fit was like we have to go there

6053.28 --> 6061.199
we have to show up like they she wasn't

6056.719 --> 6063.92
invited to the funeral yeah but she was

6061.199 --> 6066.0
notified that that happened and then we

6063.92 --> 6069.599
as a family went there and kind of

6066.0 --> 6070.719
crashed the the the funeral like like we

6069.599 --> 6074.56
are his

6070.719 --> 6077.32
family like we demand to be recognized

6074.56 --> 6080.400000000001
as his family kind weird the family

6077.32 --> 6081.5199999999995
thing and they were all like what the

6080.4 --> 6083.4
hell

6081.52 --> 6086.56
not saying that but it was the genuine

6083.4 --> 6089.119
like what all these old men they were

6086.56 --> 6092.719
like what the hell he has a family they

6089.119 --> 6094.679
never heard of it ever it was so weird

6092.719 --> 6097.159
but then like some of these old guys

6094.679 --> 6099.4800000000005
came for a visit

6097.159 --> 6102.04
afterward and they actually tried to

6099.48 --> 6102.04
test my

6102.8 --> 6107.320000000001
mind they they tried to see if I

6105.48 --> 6111.04
understood the Earth was

6107.32 --> 6113.4
flat and they asked me about Star Wars

6111.04 --> 6115.84
for that it's like do you love that do

6113.4 --> 6118.719
you think it could be real and I said

6115.84 --> 6123.1990000000005
well yeah maybe one day or something and

6118.719 --> 6126.679
then they knew like he's not he's not

6123.199 --> 6128.32
awaken even though like 10 years before

6126.679 --> 6131.8
that I was

6128.32 --> 6134.44
awakened it's just because of school and

6131.8 --> 6137.52
because of media I just kind of rolled

6134.44 --> 6139.28
back into the whole globe belief I just

6137.52 --> 6141.52
like but maybe it is possible because I

6139.28 --> 6145.239
hadn't seen it myself I hadn't boom boom

6141.52 --> 6147.76
bo on any barrier to permanently dis

6145.239 --> 6150.638999999999
yeah to permanently dispel that so I was

6147.76 --> 6152.52
just like but maybe in some

6150.639 --> 6156.92
way and

6152.52 --> 6158.8
then yeah that happened but they never

6156.92 --> 6160.719
actually told me they never told me like

6158.8 --> 6164.320000000001
but did you know the Earth is flat or

6160.719 --> 6164.32
something nope they didn't do

6166.4 --> 6173.119
that maybe he was secretly what what

6170.239 --> 6177.04
what's the point point of being secretly

6173.119 --> 6177.04
Jewish that makes no damn

6181.36 --> 6184.36
sense

6186.159 --> 6194.159
what maybe he was I mean my grandmother

6190.679 --> 6196.32
did have stories of like saving him from

6194.159 --> 6196.32
the

6196.56 --> 6203.159000000001
Germans like he was fleeing or something

6200.96 --> 6205.88
and maybe that was because of a Jewish

6203.159 --> 6208.799999999999
thing but it wasn't very clear like I

6205.88 --> 6214.679
don't know what kind of Jew he was then

6208.8 --> 6214.679
like nobody knows we don't know I don't

6216.56 --> 6221.599
know but it did always feel like there

6219.36 --> 6224.799999999999
was a little bit of

6221.599 --> 6228.599
jewess in us and in

6224.8 --> 6230.96
me we're always just

6228.599 --> 6232.84
trying seriously we were always always

6230.96 --> 6234.92
just trying like with each other we're

6232.84 --> 6236.76
always sparring always like trying

6234.92 --> 6239.4400000000005
always like see if I can get on their

6236.76 --> 6243.159000000001
nerves on this if I can on nurse with

6239.44 --> 6247.32
that so it did and I did

6243.159 --> 6250.28
sympathize with like Jewish religion a

6247.32 --> 6253.28
lot I was put to that question one time

6250.28 --> 6256.08
and it's like yeah no the actual the

6253.28 --> 6259.84
like the Jewish spiritual Pursuit seemed

6256.08 --> 6262.48
like the right thing to me so as a

6259.84 --> 6265.4800000000005
little kid on cut out of me like yeah I

6262.48 --> 6269.119
want to be a Jew I had no

6265.48 --> 6271.799999999999
idea what that actually implies

6269.119 --> 6273.44
though

6271.8 --> 6276.119000000001
yeah

6273.44 --> 6279.4
so yeah I'm not

6276.119 --> 6281.598999999999
really but yeah maybe it is in my family

6279.4 --> 6281.598999999999
a

6282.04 --> 6287.88
bit but if it is it's like kept secret

6289.56 --> 6296.1990000000005
then

6292.04 --> 6298.96
so I don't know like I speculated it

6296.199 --> 6303.4
might even be really weird like weirder

6298.96 --> 6303.4
than you he might have actually been

6303.8 --> 6311.08
like I could barely imagine it though no

6307.56 --> 6313.8
it can't be he might be related to like

6311.08 --> 6316.679
a Jewish family that was actually like

6313.8 --> 6320.8
on the na side or something that he had

6316.679 --> 6323.8
to flee for that to flee them because he

6320.8 --> 6325.56
didn't want to be part of it and later

6323.8 --> 6328.04
for having that

6325.56 --> 6329.639
Association like oh no they definitely

6328.04 --> 6331.8
didn't come out of the works again with

6329.639 --> 6337.4800000000005
his name being like that so yeah it

6331.8 --> 6337.4800000000005
might be I don't know I don't

6337.63 --> 6342.76
[Music]

6339.88 --> 6346.4400000000005
know but I do know my Illuminati kasan

6342.76 --> 6346.4400000000005
is ready and I'm going to get it right

6349.48 --> 6352.48

for

6385.83 --> 6388.89
[Music]

6394.199 --> 6401.32
right but I mean the just trying is in

6398.96 --> 6403.2390000000005
my opinion the favorite quality my

6401.32 --> 6405.4
favorite quality of juice it's like the

6403.239 --> 6408.199
thing that actually makes them really

6405.4 --> 6409.4
cool like at least they're just trying

6408.199 --> 6412.4
you

6409.4 --> 6412.4
know

6412.719 --> 6415.679
they're always up to

something Eastern stars in what the hell

6433.52 --> 6439.320000000001

6436.0 --> 6442.32
mean what the hell is an Eastern

6439.32 --> 6442.32
Star

6448.28 --> 6452.08
that the trolls make me hate you okay

6456.8 --> 6460.639
cool hey here we go

6468.679 --> 6475.679
again right but I mean I mean look you

6471.28 --> 6475.679
might be able to think of me as a Jew I

6476.44 --> 6482.638999999999
mean maybe if I did have a special hat

6479.48 --> 6485.5199999999995
on and I took my hair and then like be

6482.639 --> 6485.52
more like this

6485.76 --> 6490.280000000001
and no that's not how they I don't know

6488.36 --> 6494.598999999999
why the hell I did that but I mean yeah

6490.28 --> 6496.679
I mean this kind of does look me oh I am

6494.599 --> 6500.08
really

6496.679 --> 6503.4800000000005
Jewish so I don't know I'm cool with it

6500.08 --> 6506.08
it's it's just that if I'm Jewish

6503.48 --> 6509.119
then I'm

6506.08 --> 6512.199
like one of those atheist Jews that's

6509.119 --> 6516.92
not following the tradition but then as

6512.199 --> 6518.799999999999
an atheist Jew is following an

6516.92 --> 6521.28
actual

6518.8 --> 6525.0
theist form that is

6521.28 --> 6528.679
eclectic so maybe that is what I

6525.0 --> 6531.719
am I'm like a Jew that became a leftist

6528.679 --> 6535.0
Jew but then realized like no way but I

6531.719 --> 6539.199
couldn't be like the classic style again

6535.0 --> 6542.599
so I'm just making my own classic

6539.199 --> 6545.04
style so it's like gone left away from

6542.599 --> 6550.719
the oldfashioned format but then gone

6545.04 --> 6553.88
back right and like reformatting an

6550.719 --> 6556.719
old-fashioned style being eclectic

6553.88 --> 6559.119
Holding On by PR I mean I'm very serious

6556.719 --> 6561.52
about my personal

6559.119 --> 6563.679
religion

6561.52 --> 6568.280000000001
and I would never say like it's

6563.679 --> 6568.28
definitely not Jewish I

6568.76 --> 6576.679
mean yeah I sympathize with Jews I like

6572.8 --> 6579.119000000001
to make fun of Jews and hey I I wouldn't

6576.679 --> 6581.679
put it beneath me if I got in some

6579.119 --> 6583.239
messed up situation and somebody's like

6581.679 --> 6586.639
really after

6583.239 --> 6588.718999999999
me I wouldn't exclude saying like I just

6586.639 --> 6590.56
think he hates Jews or something he

6588.719 --> 6593.119
might be anti-semitic because I kind of

6590.56 --> 6597.84
look like a Jew or maybe I think of

6593.119 --> 6597.839999999999
myself I wouldn't say like I'll never go

6599.239 --> 6605.718999999999
there especially because it just really

6602.239 --> 6609.119
works I've never really done it though

6605.719 --> 6613.2390000000005
I'm just saying whatever is going to

6609.119 --> 6613.239
whatever I am I'll be

6619.04 --> 6625.17

6733.8 --> 6742.719
be better boy but to be fair

6737.679 --> 6742.719
slowmo it's funny because it's totally

6742.88 --> 6750.04
true I really am trying to be better boy

6747.199 --> 6753.799999999999
and I really was not very

6750.04 --> 6757.76
good 20 years

6753.8 --> 6759.96
ago I wasn't even trying to be good now

6757.76 --> 6759.96
I

6765.68 --> 6771.280000000001
[Music]

6767.96 --> 6773.639
am we all have aner little ener and with

6771.28 --> 6776.4
some that little ener is a little bit

6773.639 --> 6776.400000000001
bigger than with

6781.04 --> 6786.679
others but thanks I appreciate it that

6784.639 --> 6788.4400000000005
the the comments and it yeah it's

6786.679 --> 6790.4400000000005
supposed to also be a little funny but

6788.44 --> 6793.598999999999
it's also serious

6790.44 --> 6795.678999999999
so that's how I like to work it's like

6793.599 --> 6797.679
yeah I'll say something really serious

6795.679 --> 6800.679
but then also recognize that it does

6797.679 --> 6802.92
sound kind of funny and silly

6800.679 --> 6806.52
but that it's still also serious it's

6802.92 --> 6809.4800000000005
just like yeah no it's super serious and

6806.52 --> 6813.52
really silly and funny at the same

6809.48 --> 6814.48
time yeah I just like that I like it

6813.52 --> 6818.719
when

6814.48 --> 6818.718999999999
things make sense when they

6819.159 --> 6822.719
shouldn't I like

6828.32 --> 6833.679
that where you can literally stare at

6831.079 --> 6836.799999999999
one thing and then go to one or the

6833.679 --> 6839.76
other side of viewing

6836.8 --> 6842.1990000000005
it and those sides that you might choose

6839.76 --> 6844.639
are completely in contradiction with one

6842.199 --> 6847.239
another and would

6844.639 --> 6850.400000000001
like that they can't actually

6847.239 --> 6852.04
simultaneously logically exist but it

6850.4 --> 6854.879999999999
still

6852.04 --> 6858.679
happens and that's all of it is inherent

6854.88 --> 6860.36
I love that I love these mind

6858.679 --> 6865.159
paradoxes

6860.36 --> 6868.0
about things or paradoxical responses to

6865.159 --> 6868.0
things

6868.44 --> 6874.04
anyway it's what I

6871.079 --> 6878.04
do I'm going to take a bite out of my

6874.04 --> 6878.04
Illuminati CA

6887.679 --> 6895.88
cheers m m that's

6891.239 --> 6895.879999999999
good so fresh

6904.079 --> 6907.079
nice

6908.22 --> 6911.289000000001
[Music]

6918.599 --> 6921.599
yeah

6923.78 --> 6932.199
[Music]

6929.199 --> 6934.079
yeah one thing despite all that however

6932.199 --> 6938.638999999999
remains and that is

6934.079 --> 6941.5599999999995
that if I'm a Jew it really sucks to be

6938.639 --> 6945.32
terrible at money and being a Jew like

6941.56 --> 6945.320000000001
that is a lethal

6945.639 --> 6952.88
combination cuz there's nothing more

6948.119 --> 6955.96
shameful than for you to be truly poor

6952.88 --> 6955.96
financially I

6957.28 --> 6964.599
mean it just

6959.52 --> 6964.599
is and that has probably been the

6970.52 --> 6973.84
factor I don't

6973.92 --> 6979.2390000000005
know maybe if I was actually better with

6976.96 --> 6980.4800000000005
money and more obsessed with it or

6979.239 --> 6983.4
something

6980.48 --> 6986.36
like truly confident with it then maybe

6983.4 --> 6989.48
I would have just become fully

6986.36 --> 6991.598999999999
Jewish sounds weird right so no it's

6989.48 --> 6995.919999999999
about the old tradition yeah good luck

6991.599 --> 6995.92
with that no it's about being good with

6997.159 --> 7003.44
money like otherwise it just not going

7000.96 --> 7003.44
to work

7003.8 --> 7010.56
out

7006.04 --> 7012.36
yeah cuz like if if you're a Jew and

7010.56 --> 7014.079000000001
you're poor and you're surrounded by

7012.36 --> 7016.159
other Jews you're going to end up

7014.079 --> 7018.28
begging them for money or even lending

7016.159 --> 7022.04
them money you know what's the most

7018.28 --> 7022.04
dangerous [ __ ] thing in the

7022.32 --> 7027.92
world guess what yeah

7025.92 --> 7030.92
that

7027.92 --> 7030.92
so

7031.119 --> 7037.44
yeah if you're not good with

7034.079 --> 7040.719
money it's kind of dangerous being a

7037.44 --> 7042.32
Jew I this is kind of of oversimplified

7040.719 --> 7045.199
by the way I

7042.32 --> 7049.719
mean this is getting into silly

7045.199 --> 7049.719
territory but there is something to that

7050.61 --> 7053.78
[Music]

7058.52 --> 7062.4800000000005
though the chat is messed

7062.96 --> 7068.4
up oh that's

7065.639 --> 7071.2390000000005
weird it

7068.4 --> 7074.239
is there's a difference between top chat

7071.239 --> 7077.718999999999
and live chat every time you refresh the

7074.239 --> 7080.879999999999
page it automatically switches to top

7077.719 --> 7085.159
chat you have to then manually click

7080.88 --> 7087.76
live chat in the box of the chat

7085.159 --> 7090.119
above don't forget that top chat doesn't

7087.76 --> 7090.119000000001
show

7093.079 --> 7098.32
everything female equivalent of

7096.76 --> 7101.320000000001
Freemasons

7098.32 --> 7101.32
wow

7111.8 --> 7116.719
what that's that's just

7118.599 --> 7124.400000000001
wrong female equip so that that coven

7128.32 --> 7131.32
then

7138.159 --> 7142.598999999999
sounds like Eastern stars is a

7153.96 --> 7161.2390000000005
coven men can be yeah but only if

7157.04 --> 7161.239
they're total facts here we go

7168.199 --> 7176.32
again now I'm I made that up they do end

7172.52 --> 7176.320000000001
up being total facts

7185.96 --> 7192.76
though but yeah I mean I wasn't coven

7190.04 --> 7195.239
for a bit it wasn't that serious

7192.76 --> 7198.04
though it's just that even within that

7195.239 --> 7200.36
it's always like yeah there is me and

7198.04 --> 7203.679
then there's all of

7200.36 --> 7206.28
you like I always I never was like

7203.679 --> 7209.079
actually part of a group I've always

7206.28 --> 7210.5199999999995
been like I am the representative of the

7209.079 --> 7213.5199999999995
Sovereign

7210.52 --> 7215.400000000001
Arwin sounds arrogant perhaps but it's a

7213.52 --> 7218.2390000000005
spiritual thing and that is how it's

7215.4 --> 7219.879999999999
always been everywhere I go I'm like a

7218.239 --> 7224.119
diplomat that

7219.88 --> 7227.52
represents me and my universe and my

7224.119 --> 7231.92
religion and my

7227.52 --> 7233.4400000000005
sovereignty like doing the diplomacy

7231.92 --> 7236.1990000000005
with other

7233.44 --> 7240.28
forms that's how I did those things

7236.199 --> 7242.48
that's how I joined a sort of coven and

7240.28 --> 7243.639
that's how I hung around with very

7242.48 --> 7247.159
dubious

7243.639 --> 7250.119
people yeah so I would always be like Oh

7247.159 --> 7251.679
I'm part of the gang but not really

7250.119 --> 7253.4
and it wouldn't be super act I wouldn't

7251.679 --> 7256.32
be try to do it it definitely wouldn't

7253.4 --> 7257.638999999999
be sacrificing it I'm just studying it

7256.32 --> 7261.28
I'm just

7257.639 --> 7265.1990000000005
trying trying to study it study all of

7261.28 --> 7267.759999999999
it like I wanted to understand I wanted

7265.199 --> 7271.04
to understand satanists I wanted to

7267.76 --> 7272.84
understand Nazis I wanted to understand

7271.04 --> 7276.079
all of it like

7272.84 --> 7277.679
why why do they do that why do you

7276.079 --> 7280.5199999999995
choose that what is the thing that

7277.679 --> 7283.76
actually drives them what motivates them

7280.52 --> 7286.56
to go that far what motivates them to

7283.76 --> 7289.280000000001
abandon the world to a certain degree

7286.56 --> 7293.4800000000005
and then is it worth it to

7289.28 --> 7297.04
them I asked those types of people those

7293.48 --> 7300.799999999999
personal questions and got the answers I

7297.04 --> 7304.0
got the answers I got what I was looking

7300.8 --> 7304.0
for I

7308.04 --> 7315.95
know

7309.2 --> 7315.95
[Music]

7318.36 --> 7324.88

7332.4 --> 7336.799999999999

name to

7336.8 --> 7342.360000000001

7339.679 --> 7342.36
gay

7363.199 --> 7369.48
spiritually given name the name that I

7366.199 --> 7371.079
got to choose as a 5-year-old

7369.48 --> 7373.959999999999
to have

7371.079 --> 7375.799999999999
Consciousness parallel to physical

7373.96 --> 7378.28
reality in the dark world and my mother

7375.8 --> 7381.4400000000005
could interface with that virtual

7378.28 --> 7384.28
reality moment so that my mother when I

7381.44 --> 7387.96
was five could ask me is this the name

7384.28 --> 7391.679
you want and we actually both remembered

7387.96 --> 7394.079
communicating verbally about it and how

7391.679 --> 7395.56
I told her yes this is perfect this is

7394.079 --> 7399.5599999999995
exactly what I

7395.56 --> 7403.0
need yeah being 5 years old

7399.56 --> 7406.360000000001
not being able to even actually

7403.0 --> 7408.56
communicate but we shared a dark World

7406.36 --> 7412.159
experience that I still to this day

7408.56 --> 7415.56
remember continually it that's like it's

7412.159 --> 7422.32
my first initiation

7415.56 --> 7427.88
ever was five I initiated me

7422.32 --> 7429.599
yeah I did it just happened I woke up I

7427.88 --> 7431.159000000001
decided I'm going to going to be like a

7429.599 --> 7432.28
wizard I'm going to be all about

7431.159 --> 7434.4
knowledge and

7432.28 --> 7437.199
Consciousness I'm going to master the

7434.4 --> 7438.879999999999
other dimensions and I figured it out

7437.199 --> 7441.44
when it was

7438.88 --> 7444.079
five before I even knew how to

7441.44 --> 7444.079
physically

7445.12 --> 7448.239
[Music]

7457.8 --> 7463.4800000000005
talk

7460.239 --> 7465.48
yeah I'm such a such a special boy I'm

7463.48 --> 7470.718999999999
such a special

7465.48 --> 7470.718999999999
boy I'm The Specialist of Specialist of

7477.119 --> 7484.598999999999
boys not that much though it's just that

7481.0 --> 7486.8
I'm very aware of how it happened a lot

7484.599 --> 7488.96
of people go through these kinds of

7486.8 --> 7490.719
things as a kid and it just happens to

7488.96 --> 7492.2390000000005
them they don't it doesn't really stick

7490.719 --> 7495.04
to their mind

7492.239 --> 7498.119
forever for some reason these things

7495.04 --> 7500.96
stuck to my mind very

7498.119 --> 7503.719
deeply it became more prominent closer

7500.96 --> 7507.28
to my Consciousness instead of all just

7503.719 --> 7507.28
sitting in the background of my

7508.52 --> 7514.76
subconscious and becoming conscious like

7511.0 --> 7517.679
that also kind of forced me to

7514.76 --> 7519.679
develop to get a real complex

7517.679 --> 7521.92
foundational INF structure of

7519.679 --> 7524.92
understanding at a very young

7521.92 --> 7529.719
age like I learned to understand things

7524.92 --> 7529.719
before I could even properly communicate

7530.52 --> 7537.96
anything and then as I grew I

7534.92 --> 7541.0
understood my entire life is going to be

7537.96 --> 7542.32
all about being able to communicate what

7541.0 --> 7545.559
I've

7542.32 --> 7549.36
learned so communication was now my

7545.559 --> 7553.400000000001
specialty is like that is my

7549.36 --> 7553.4
the skill that I need to Forever

7553.76 --> 7557.76
develop that's what I'll do in

7561.4 --> 7566.92
life make things

7564.239 --> 7568.159
comprehensible reveal structures where

7566.92 --> 7572.28
people don't

7568.159 --> 7574.32
look find the way through show what is

7572.28 --> 7578.92

right yeah but anyway slow-mo the the

7742.36 --> 7747.759999999999
guy in the coven thing like I was lucky

7744.8 --> 7750.599
enough to actually be in a

7747.76 --> 7753.52
coven where we weren't surrounded by

7750.599 --> 7757.28
gays it's like when I got into it and I

7753.52 --> 7760.320000000001
went into like oh wika stuff that was

7757.28 --> 7760.32
around between

7760.36 --> 7767.04
2002

7762.36 --> 7769.88
2005 roughly maybe a bit

7767.04 --> 7771.719
longer but when I went in that group it

7769.88 --> 7774.84
was mostly

7771.719 --> 7778.4800000000005
girls and a couple of guys and guess

7774.84 --> 7782.04
what those guys they weren't gay I was

7778.48 --> 7785.079
like the luckiest guy ever I mean in

7782.04 --> 7789.44
retrospect now thinking back it's a

7785.079 --> 7791.558999999999
miracle I wasn't just surrounded by gay

7789.44 --> 7794.879999999999
and if I had I'd probably like gotten

7791.559 --> 7798.84
the [ __ ] out of there CU even then when

7794.88 --> 7803.04
I wasn't overtly homophobic yet I still

7798.84 --> 7803.04
really didn't like the hanging around

7803.119 --> 7808.28
gays I tolerate them but then I'd get

7806.28 --> 7812.88
sick of it and then I'd like I don't

7808.28 --> 7814.679
want to be here anymore cuz gays make me

7812.88 --> 7818.52
miserable then

7814.679 --> 7823.119
doing and everybody clapping makes me

7818.52 --> 7826.360000000001
miserable I'm sorry it's not oh that's

7823.119 --> 7829.079
God that's just told you that you have

7826.36 --> 7831.32
to think like that no it's always been

7829.079 --> 7835.759999999999
like that even when I was completely

7831.32 --> 7838.92
weird and atheist and satanic sort of or

7835.76 --> 7841.639
I thought I was yeah it's always been

7838.92 --> 7843.159
like that it's it's like genetic I'm

7841.639 --> 7846.76
genetically

7843.159 --> 7849.4
homophobic I can't help it it doesn't

7846.76 --> 7852.639
matter how I think about gays it's not a

7849.4 --> 7854.4
religious duty to hate them I just can't

7852.639 --> 7858.32
stand

7854.4 --> 7862.96
it it makes me sick and I was really

7858.32 --> 7864.92
lucky to have to have been going into wi

7862.96 --> 7868.119
not ending up surrounded by a bunch of

7864.92 --> 7868.119
gay guys very

7873.62 --> 7876.7699999999995
[Music]

7877.159 --> 7880.159
lucky

7887.4 --> 7890.159
danc at the

7902.119 --> 7910.159
maple is yeah but I mean is it gay or is

7905.84 --> 7910.159000000001
it just really for the female I don't

7910.28 --> 7915.8
know it all depends it all depends on

7913.28 --> 7918.559
how the guys are there if they're like

7915.8 --> 7921.400000000001
yay I like it yeah they're gay but if

7918.559 --> 7923.360000000001
they're like yeah the women need this

7921.4 --> 7925.799999999999
then that doesn't have to be

7923.36 --> 7927.36
gay and that was kind of my attitude

7925.8 --> 7930.599
with it it's like yeah this is all just

7927.36 --> 7932.4
for women but I mean I I can be there I

7930.599 --> 7935.88
can be part of it it's just like this is

7932.4 --> 7937.079
not for me to enjoy this is about this

7935.88 --> 7940.079
is for the

7937.079 --> 7940.079
women

7941.239 --> 7946.48
you don't like undercover gaze oh my

7948.599 --> 7956.400000000001
God you don't like flam blowing Gaye

7951.159 --> 7956.4
well that's something we share then

7967.04 --> 7970.04
yeah

7979.44 --> 7985.598999999999
what you like gays who don't act gay yes

7985.8 --> 7991.320000000001
exactly and there's something weird

7988.159 --> 7994.239
though because like there have been gays

7991.32 --> 7997.0
like that and then I end up like really

7994.239 --> 8000.4
thinking they're really freaking awesome

7997.0 --> 8003.36
but only because they know about me that

8000.4 --> 8005.839999999999
it'll never work and then they like

8003.36 --> 8007.48
become my best like it feels to me like

8005.84 --> 8011.559
they're my best friend

8007.48 --> 8011.558999999999
ever that's happened plenty of

8012.119 --> 8018.88
times but it's only because I trusted

8015.679 --> 8020.36
them I trusted them that they would

8018.88 --> 8022.400000000001
understand I'm not gay and that they

8020.36 --> 8025.44
would never

8022.4 --> 8029.5199999999995
try and if they would accept that like

8025.44 --> 8031.759999999999
I'd even like dude he's really

8029.52 --> 8034.8
unhappy I don't like it when he's really

8031.76 --> 8038.4400000000005
unhappy he's gay I'm going to see if I

8034.8 --> 8041.8
can like make

8038.44 --> 8045.119
him I'd basically like bring him a

8041.8 --> 8047.400000000001
dude because well because he's not being

8045.119 --> 8050.839999999999
gay to me and I'm like I want you to be

8047.4 --> 8053.36
happy I don't want to see how that works

8050.84 --> 8055.28
I just want to I just want you to not be

8053.36 --> 8059.079
miserable

8055.28 --> 8061.559
right cuz because like you can be gay as

8059.079 --> 8064.4
long as you're not gay to

8061.559 --> 8068.8
me as long as I don't have to actually

8064.4 --> 8068.799999999999
witness the gay Parts the gay

8071.199 --> 8078.638999999999
thingies the gross

8074.599 --> 8080.76
stuff like one thing I definitely never

8078.639 --> 8084.0
want to see is guys

8080.76 --> 8086.76
kissing in in public like I never want

8084.0 --> 8086.76
to see that

8086.88 --> 8089.88
ever

8091.52 --> 8096.159000000001
yeah and I know that's exactly what I

8093.599 --> 8098.52
did that one time and I'm sure that all

8096.159 --> 8101.159
my gay following will never make me

8098.52 --> 8103.84
forget that that that I did actually do

8101.159 --> 8106.0
that one time and it I immediately felt

8103.84 --> 8108.8
sick and ashamed for that and the shame

8106.0 --> 8110.96
has been haunting me ever since one

8108.8 --> 8114.559
thing is for sure though after that

8110.96 --> 8118.52
point I was absolutely without any

8114.559 --> 8121.679
reservation certain that I'm not gay

8118.52 --> 8124.280000000001
and that I would never accept it because

8121.679 --> 8126.32
it is partially about accepting yeah

8124.28 --> 8129.92
people that become

8126.32 --> 8132.119
gay how do they do that by accepting

8129.92 --> 8135.1990000000005
like yeah I'm

8132.119 --> 8137.598999999999
gay and then you actually become that

8135.199 --> 8140.879999999999
and then you can't go back now you're

8137.599 --> 8142.96
stuck to that forever with all the

8140.88 --> 8147.04
implications I

8142.96 --> 8149.079
don't you no I did not have a gay

8147.04 --> 8152.5199999999995
experience I kissed the dude one time

8149.079 --> 8154.639
because I wanted to be empirical I was

8152.52 --> 8157.0
surrounded by liberals everything that

8154.639 --> 8159.1990000000005
was gay was super cool everything that

8157.0 --> 8161.32
was gay would get power would get

8159.199 --> 8164.598999999999
respect everything it's like gay

8161.32 --> 8166.679
advertisement on everything in a time

8164.599 --> 8168.719
where I was like I want to actually

8166.679 --> 8169.719
manifest I want some power I want to do

8168.719 --> 8171.88
some

8169.719 --> 8173.8
good and people were telling me yeah

8171.88 --> 8175.079
well you have to be gay then so I was

8173.8 --> 8179.360000000001
like

8175.079 --> 8181.4
okay will be really convenient

8179.36 --> 8183.598999999999
and then thought well yeah if you really

8181.4 --> 8187.32
want to know you have to kiss a guy and

8183.599 --> 8189.1990000000005
then well maybe I was gay that's what I

8187.32 --> 8192.519
was thinking at the time well only one

8189.199 --> 8195.199999999999
way to find out and then I tried that

8192.519 --> 8198.359
and then I immediately regretted it

8195.2 --> 8200.960000000001
almost threw up after that and then I

8198.359 --> 8204.84
knew I'm never going to ever try that

8200.96 --> 8208.319
again like I know now it makes me

8204.84 --> 8210.84
sick like without any reservation of the

8208.319 --> 8213.08
Mind thinking about it was truly neutral

8210.84 --> 8215.519
what happened in the truly neutral state

8213.08 --> 8220.559
it made me physically sick and after

8215.519 --> 8223.16
that point I knew like no never again

8220.559 --> 8224.518999999998
before that it was always just like oh

8223.16 --> 8226.519
everybody's always talking about

8224.519 --> 8228.76
everybody's like oh this and that oh so

8226.519 --> 8232.16
special oh and I just was it was all

8228.76 --> 8232.16
very [ __ ] confusing to

8232.719 --> 8239.598999999998
me and when like half the people you

8235.679 --> 8242.24
talk to ask tell you you're gay because

8239.599 --> 8245.84
of some Behavior you have and hey I was

8242.24 --> 8249.16
like hippie-ish I was very loose I was

8245.84 --> 8252.12
childlike loose and that is often

8249.16 --> 8254.639
associated with gay Behavior apparently

8252.12 --> 8256.519
and that [ __ ] pisses me

8254.639 --> 8260.559
off

8256.519 --> 8263.76
yeah having childlike innocence is not

8260.559 --> 8266.279999999999
[ __ ] gay just because gays some of

8263.76 --> 8269.639000000001
these gays have that doesn't mean that

8266.28 --> 8271.599
that is per default gay it's a character

8269.639 --> 8274.199999999999
trait it doesn't have anything to do

8271.599 --> 8274.2
with [ __ ]

8279.639 --> 8286.719
homosexuality yeah it is a [ __ ]

8281.679 --> 8289.599
Choice auma virus it [ __ ] is you can

8286.719 --> 8291.96
choose what to do with your impulses you

8289.599 --> 8295.76
can choose how you will regard your

8291.96 --> 8299.518999999998
impulses you can choose on what you want

8295.76 --> 8299.519
with your life

8310.2 --> 8314.04
how many people would be gay if it

8311.96 --> 8317.039999999999
wasn't pushed in your

8314.04 --> 8317.04
face

8318.08 --> 8325.559
uh exactly the same amount except you

8322.359 --> 8325.559000000001
wouldn't see it all the

8325.88 --> 8331.199999999999
time cuz people that are like oh going

8329.08 --> 8333.84
along because it's popular they're not

8331.2 --> 8336.0
really gay they're just posers they just

8333.84 --> 8337.719000000001
pretend to be and being totally

8336.0 --> 8340.08
Psychopathic about it they have no

8337.719 --> 8341.678999999998
objection apparently being identified as

8340.08 --> 8343.719
that because they think they can

8341.679 --> 8346.88
psychopathically get an advantage out of

8343.719 --> 8350.24
it so they're not actually

8346.88 --> 8353.479
gay they probably don't actually do gay

8350.24 --> 8357.199999999999
things only in public so that they still

8353.479 --> 8359.039999999999
get marked as gay and get the advantages

8357.2 --> 8363.639000000001
in business and

8359.04 --> 8366.639000000001
crap yeah so that's how it

8363.639 --> 8368.279999999999
is if it wouldn't be push on everybody

8366.639 --> 8369.518999999998
well there would be exactly the same

8368.28 --> 8373.28
amount of gay

8369.519 --> 8376.04
people they you just not be seeing it

8373.28 --> 8378.599
and a lot of people would drop the act

8376.04 --> 8382.080000000002
because there's no more business

8378.599 --> 8385.719000000001
advantage to being

8382.08 --> 8385.719

8807.72 --> 8811.64
you should have then called yourself

8809.2 --> 8813.04
duper goons or something then it would

8811.64 --> 8817.16
have made

8813.04 --> 8820.6
sense or duper G or something but don't

8817.16 --> 8820.6

created and I never changed it

8841.96 --> 8850.759999999998
although I did like change the overall

8844.92 --> 8850.76
code to at r133 I did do

8851.359 --> 8856.800000000001
that but that's because that became an

8854.319 --> 8860.0
option to actually you had a choice with

8856.8 --> 8863.319
that you could actually get the exact

8860.0 --> 8867.439
code you could determine that so that's

8863.319 --> 8871.08
what I did at r133 that's literally the

8867.439 --> 8875.16
in the URL of my channel

8871.08 --> 8877.88
now but I never changed my name of the

9520.76 --> 9527.04
and lame and

9523.68 --> 9529.279
gay and like

9527.04 --> 9532.359
everything about the Titanic movie was

9529.279 --> 9535.640000000001
like this fatalistic idiotic romance

9532.359 --> 9537.319
feeling like oh romance everything is

9535.64 --> 9540.16
going to [ __ ] but I'm going to hold on

9537.319 --> 9542.439
to the romance until somebody dies and

9540.16 --> 9544.76
then I'll feel all Justified like it's

hate the Titanic like despise it

9564.04 --> 9568.439
fact I've never met a girl that liked

9566.72 --> 9571.119999999999
the Titanic that I was actually

9587.319 --> 9593.199999999999
would ever consider going there is to

9589.68 --> 9596.2
like have a sex date with some bimbo

9593.2 --> 9598.640000000001
that is into that like that's the only

9596.2 --> 9600.37
reason I could imagine you would sit

9598.64 --> 9603.458999999999
through

9636.56 --> 9642.199999999999
sucks yeah the only thing that could

9638.92 --> 9645.08
redeem Titanic is if Godzilla made a

9642.2 --> 9647.08
cameo and literally like stepped on the

9645.08 --> 9649.88
ship before it hit the

9647.08 --> 9652.56
iceberg and then just disintegrated

9649.88 --> 9654.119999999999
everybody with this nuclear Ray like

9652.56 --> 9655.72
that would have that would have been the

9654.12 --> 9658.800000000001
only thing that would have could have

9655.72 --> 9658.8
fixed the Titanic

9659.76 --> 9664.16
movie would be kind of cool if somebody

9662.08 --> 9666.92
would actually make that edit I mean you

9664.16 --> 9666.92
can do that

9667.72 --> 9673.519999999999
now with proper CGI approach but I mean

9671.96 --> 9674.199999999999
that would have been pretty badass it's

9673.52 --> 9677.84
just

9674.2 --> 9681.2
like to the world oh no we're hitting

9677.84 --> 9681.2
the iceberg and suddenly you

9681.76 --> 9687.12

9684.439 --> 9688.04
like you see the Titanic just bursting

9687.12 --> 9692.160000000002
in

9688.04 --> 9695.080000000002
Flames with Godzilla

9692.16 --> 9697.6

9695.08 --> 9697.6
fixed the

[Music]

9704.439 --> 9707.439

9711.0 --> 9716.84
hate the woman for dropping the necklace

9713.08 --> 9721.72
yes I hate all women that do

9716.84 --> 9726.56
that yeah you don't throw away jewelry

9721.72 --> 9729.319
for your petty [ __ ] heartfelt symbol

9726.56 --> 9732.039999999999
yeah you [ __ ] ass

9729.319 --> 9734.56
white and and that's probably where my

9732.04 --> 9736.68
inner Jew comes out it's like I am

9734.56 --> 9740.319
seriously a offended by people that do

9736.68 --> 9742.6
that like oh I'm saying goodbye in my

9740.319 --> 9744.56
heart I'm going to take this ring that

9742.6 --> 9748.0
probably cost somebody

9744.56 --> 9750.359
like 100 hours working just to be able

9748.0 --> 9752.72
to afford that to gift to their wife and

9750.359 --> 9755.640000000001
you got it and I'm going to throw it

9752.72 --> 9760.08
away because of sentiment go [ __ ]

9755.64 --> 9762.599999999999
yourself you disgusting hag you're never

9760.08 --> 9765.359
getting a ring ever

9762.6 --> 9769.359
again I'm going to tattoo it on your

9765.359 --> 9772.720000000001
forehead this [ __ ] throws away jewelry

9769.359 --> 9777.92
for sentimental reason never give her

9772.72 --> 9777.92
anything yeah that's my response to

9786.399 --> 9791.439
that yeah you throw away jewelry for

9789.12 --> 9794.640000000001
your [ __ ] sentimentality good you

9791.439 --> 9797.24
should never be allowed to be given a

9794.64 --> 9800.18
piece of jewel y ever

9797.24 --> 9803.199999999999
again yeah that's my opinion about

9800.18 --> 9803.2
[Music]

9814.279 --> 9821.92
that he was 100 didn't care anymore yeah

9818.68 --> 9824.16
well what about her Offspring who she

9821.92 --> 9825.960000000001
could have given that and then told her

9824.16 --> 9830.08
a story of everything that happened with

9825.96 --> 9834.199999999999
that Jewel yeah that way her Offspring

9830.08 --> 9837.359
far far far Offspring could still

9834.2 --> 9843.12
actually remember a story of what their

9837.359 --> 9845.84
ancestors did just by a piece of jewelry

9843.12 --> 9848.76
yeah that's what it's

9845.84 --> 9851.84
about and that's why it is a high a

9848.76 --> 9855.399
grave offense to just discard jewelry

9851.84 --> 9855.399
for [ __ ] sentimentalities

9855.76 --> 9859.92
that's a piece of knowledge you're

9857.72 --> 9863.438999999998
throwing away there that's a piece of

9859.92 --> 9867.6
knowledge of your history that you

9863.439 --> 9870.92
should keep to give to your Offspring so

9867.6 --> 9874.640000000001
that I don't know they could perhaps

9870.92 --> 9877.279
learn from history and thereby not

9874.64 --> 9879.64
repeating the same mistakes oh no we

9877.279 --> 9881.800000000001
have to throw it away so we could get

9879.64 --> 9883.96
grabed by a bunch of [ __ ] demons

9881.8 --> 9885.92
again with their offspring oh two

9883.96 --> 9888.358999999999
generations later oh they have to start

9885.92 --> 9890.88
from scratch because we threw away the

9888.359 --> 9893.08
knowledge because we're sentimental

9890.88 --> 9895.438999999998
egotistical

9893.08 --> 9897.56
[ __ ] oh for sentimental reason I'm

9895.439 --> 9900.52
going to throw a piece of History

9897.56 --> 9901.439
away that my children will never know

9900.52 --> 9905.560000000001
about

9901.439 --> 9905.56
now yeah you [ __ ]

9907.0 --> 9913.399
[ __ ] I hate it I hate everything about

9910.96 --> 9913.399
[ __ ]

9913.68 --> 9917.08
Titanic yeah

9924.84 --> 9929.16
gross was the symbolic horror of Babylon

9926.8 --> 9933.039999999999
in theie yeah well maybe she

9929.16 --> 9934.6
was I don't care though I just hated it

9933.04 --> 9936.319000000001
like at that point I don't care what

9934.6 --> 9939.24
it's supposed to represent anymore I

9936.319 --> 9943.319
just [ __ ] hate everything about the

9939.24 --> 9946.359
movie it's like the only regret I have

10337.88 --> 10342.64
Groundhog Day movie I like

10340.359 --> 10344.04
it I think it's one of Bill Murray's

10342.64 --> 10346.479
best

10344.04 --> 10349.2
movies and I'm sure there's a whole

10346.479 --> 10352.109999999999
bunch of things wrong with

10349.2 --> 10354.16
it I still like it

10352.11 --> 10357.2
[Music]

10354.16 --> 10359.8
though it's a movie that you can like

10357.2 --> 10361.960000000001
watch every decade and still have fun

10359.8 --> 10361.96
with

10363.439 --> 10369.64
it and ever like there's a lot of other

10366.96 --> 10371.08
movies that do it the same thing and

10369.64 --> 10373.64
they're just

10371.08 --> 10375.92
like everybody just thinks like oh

10373.64 --> 10379.358999999999
that's a Groundhog Day

10375.92 --> 10379.359
movie it's that

10385.12 --> 10388.12
simple

10389.0 --> 10396.279
what chicken sweet corn soup man that's

10392.88 --> 10399.278999999999
a long time ago since I had that that is

10396.279 --> 10402.479000000001
a thing isn't it that they take like

10399.279 --> 10407.359
chicken soup and then put corn in

10402.479 --> 10410.319
it that is so long ago since I had that

10407.359 --> 10413.319
I think my dad used to make that it like

10410.319 --> 10418.199999999999
that like a long time

10413.319 --> 10420.8
ago that's like at least 20 no probably

10418.2 --> 10420.800000000001
30

10423.359 --> 10426.359
years

10432.76 --> 10439.0
split pea

10434.279 --> 10442.2
soup yeah I mean that's a very Dutch

10439.0 --> 10442.2
type of meal I like

10443.04 --> 10449.160000000002
that like with beef sausage that like

10446.6 --> 10453.279
smoked beef sausage great combination

10449.16 --> 10454.84
you have splitz be soup with a bit of

10453.279 --> 10459.2
uh

10454.84 --> 10459.2
smoke beef sausage on the side

10461.56 --> 10466.6
great I've had that a couple of times

10464.279 --> 10468.68
this winter because it's like especially

10466.6 --> 10472.2
when it's freezing it's just

10468.68 --> 10475.2
fantastic really warms you up anyway

10472.2 --> 10477.84
especially from a Chinese I I dude

10475.2 --> 10482.239000000001
Chinese rest the last time I've been to

10477.84 --> 10483.279
a Chinese restaurant is at least 30

10482.239 --> 10485.039999999999
years

10483.279 --> 10487.800000000001
ago

10485.04 --> 10489.6
I literally don't probably the the last

10487.8 --> 10493.438999999998
place I was

10489.6 --> 10493.439
like it's not even there

10495.0 --> 10500.72
anymore I've been to an Indonesian

10497.8 --> 10503.039999999999
restaurant later though because that was

10500.72 --> 10504.72
kind of a thing that my family from my

10503.04 --> 10507.080000000002
dad's side would used to do when they'd

10504.72 --> 10507.08
come

10509.92 --> 10516.2
together and that's like 20 years

10513.2 --> 10516.2
ago

10520.88 --> 10526.039999999999
that was sort of making yeah I don't

10523.399 --> 10530.0
have that capacity right now but yes I

10526.04 --> 10534.04
grew up in a house that had a garden in

10530.0 --> 10537.0
which we did just that derer so I'm very

10534.04 --> 10540.84
familiar with it as a concept and I

10537.0 --> 10543.08
always well recently not always but even

10540.84 --> 10544.84
with my ex that's what I wanted I wanted

10543.08 --> 10547.08
to recreate that

10544.84 --> 10549.64
and we were getting

10547.08 --> 10551.56
there until she decided that she got

10549.64 --> 10555.119999999999
bored with me or something I don't know

10551.56 --> 10555.119999999999
why I never really figured it

10557.16 --> 10564.039999999999
out right but what I do know is that I

10561.319 --> 10565.239
really would like to get some support

10564.04 --> 10568.0

10565.239 --> 10571.399

10571.399 --> 10577.08

today

10584.8 --> 10591.0

controversial opinions on things and

11070.72 --> 11076.479
everything and my sometimes somewhat

11073.52 --> 11078.720000000001
inappropriate radical attitude but

11076.479 --> 11081.479
they've never like deprived me which

would like seriously they would have

11081.479 --> 11085.96
they could absolutely destroy me if they

11083.64 --> 11087.76
did that because I am quite dependent on

functioning on PayPal I am they're more

option from PayPal I can literally get

11222.04 --> 11227.479000000001
it immediately and have it available

11225.279 --> 11231.560000000001
immediately and I have to say yeah for

11227.479 --> 11233.599999999999
that 1% fee that's actually incredibly

11231.56 --> 11236.0
worth it because I don't owe always have

11233.6 --> 11238.68
to do it but if I really need it in the

11236.0 --> 11242.72
moment then I can literally do it

11238.68 --> 11246.52
immediately that is a kind of a valuable

11242.72 --> 11246.519999999999
option so I'm I'm

11254.399 --> 11261.278999999999
happy yep it's already there that was

11258.359 --> 11264.800000000001
quick this is just instantaneous

11261.279 --> 11267.359
transfer instead of waiting two days or

11264.8 --> 11269.92
some it's usually just the next day

11267.359 --> 11269.92
unless it's

11272.439 --> 11278.2
weekend what were you going to buy with

11275.04 --> 11282.239000000001
that when they denied you

11278.2 --> 11285.52
what what was I trying to buy uh

11282.239 --> 11287.76
products from infowar store uh

11285.52 --> 11289.640000000001
membership to unauthorized.tv own

11287.76 --> 11292.359
Benjamin's

11289.64 --> 11295.278999999999
website uh things like that everything

11292.359 --> 11297.800000000001
that's political in nature they just say

11295.279 --> 11300.12
like no we just you're not allowed to

11297.8 --> 11300.119999999999
buy

11300.8 --> 11304.519999999999
that so that's what I've really noticed

11303.239 --> 11308.439
it

11304.52 --> 11311.92
with so I'm I wouldn't be surprised if I

11308.439 --> 11315.0
for example try to buy a membership at

11311.92 --> 11317.08
forum for democracy that my bank would

11315.0 --> 11319.279
just like make that transaction

11317.08 --> 11321.279
impossible I mean I wouldn't be

11319.279 --> 11324.359
surprised if at some point they would

11321.279 --> 11326.800000000001
actually just do that

11324.359 --> 11329.319
right and I'm pretty damn sure if I for

11326.8 --> 11333.519999999999
example want to become a member of David

11329.319 --> 11335.359
ik's website iconic to get their special

11333.52 --> 11338.04
videos or whatever or

11335.359 --> 11340.399000000001
books that they would just refuse that

11338.04 --> 11342.84
now they would just like no you can't do

11340.399 --> 11347.96
that because he's on the bad boy list

11342.84 --> 11351.880000000001
he's on the No No list he can't even fly

11347.96 --> 11354.56
in into the country from England so the

11351.88 --> 11358.16
banks would just like

11354.56 --> 11358.16
refuse to that

11364.76 --> 11369.439
transaction apparently PayPal has real

11367.04 --> 11373.52
money where Banks don't

11369.439 --> 11377.399
yeah isn't that just crazy marginal

11373.52 --> 11377.399000000001
banking is that what that's

11381.92 --> 11388.2
called

11384.84 --> 11391.439
yeah yeah but akum I don't like Banks

11388.2 --> 11394.359
taking money but what I do like is

11391.439 --> 11397.399
options it's like do you want this now

11394.359 --> 11400.439
do you want this fast it's going to be a

11397.399 --> 11403.0
fee you have to pay for the service you

11400.439 --> 11404.76
don't want to pay for the service fine

11403.0 --> 11408.84
but you just get the

11404.76 --> 11411.64
regular the waiting time right that's

11408.84 --> 11413.8
very reasonable that is extremely

11411.64 --> 11414.68
reasonable to do that

11413.8 --> 11420.88
it's

11414.68 --> 11424.880000000001
options options service with a fee or

11420.88 --> 11428.72
not a fee and then it just takes the

11424.88 --> 11432.239
regular time I mean that's

11428.72 --> 11436.84
great isn't that exactly what you

11432.239 --> 11439.84
want from a bank or a paying

11436.84 --> 11439.84
service

11441.84 --> 11446.11
options

11442.96 --> 11446.109999999999
[Music]

11446.92 --> 11450.960000000001
fractional Reserve yeah but that has

11448.96 --> 11452.0
that's different the fractional Reserve

11450.96 --> 11455.479
banking

11452.0 --> 11458.8
is that's not about how payments work

11455.479 --> 11461.76
that's just like how you can create

11458.8 --> 11464.119999999999
loans yeah that's what that's about it's

11461.76 --> 11469.04
the loaning system

11464.12 --> 11470.800000000001
not transferring money it's about loans

11469.04 --> 11471.76
that's what fractional Reserve banking

11470.8 --> 11474.759999999998
is

11471.76 --> 11474.76
about

11478.96 --> 11483.72
revolute is sh what is that is that a

11489.359 --> 11495.52
bank I just think that I think that most

11493.279 --> 11497.76
European banks that have the entire

11495.52 --> 11502.2
Society has rested upon I think they've

11497.76 --> 11504.2
undergone a full scale uh well Soviet

11502.2 --> 11507.04
Revolution

11504.2 --> 11510.12
I think that there is a literal banking

11507.04 --> 11514.0
conspiracy in Europe right now and

11510.12 --> 11517.6
they're trying to basically extort

11514.0 --> 11520.0
everyone into

11517.6 --> 11523.16
communism I think that that is what they

11520.0 --> 11523.16
do that is what they are

11523.439 --> 11530.279
doing that's why the bankers are like on

11527.16 --> 11534.359
my list like I keep mentioning them when

11530.279 --> 11535.960000000001
I get really angry because they are

11534.359 --> 11538.239
directly

11535.96 --> 11543.319
responsible for the predicament we're

11538.239 --> 11546.68
all in here they're directly responsible

11543.319 --> 11550.84
so I will keep mentioning Bankers every

11546.68 --> 11555.04
time I get really angry because they are

11550.84 --> 11558.880000000001
directly responsible for our

11555.04 --> 11562.439
predicament yeah you are directly

11558.88 --> 11565.759999999998
responsible I know you are you know you

11562.439 --> 11570.399
are are and the entire world will know

11565.76 --> 11574.880000000001
you are and we're coming for you we are

11570.399 --> 11578.8
not going to let you get away with this

11574.88 --> 11581.16
treachery you see we know what you did

11578.8 --> 11582.199999999999
we know what you do we know what you

11581.16 --> 11584.92
want to

11582.2 --> 11587.12
do you're not going to get away with it

11584.92 --> 11587.12
this

11587.2 --> 11594.960000000001
time yeah your little Communist

11591.399 --> 11597.96
Revolution consp hery is not going to

11594.96 --> 11597.96
work this

11604.96 --> 11608.019999999999
[Music]

11620.64 --> 11625.92
time yes exactly here here we go again

11623.16 --> 11629.039999999999
it's disgusting but I mean it does keep

11625.92 --> 11630.52
things going so it's not even about oh

11629.04 --> 11632.84
what are they doing with the money no

11630.52 --> 11637.279
it's what they're doing with the people

11632.84 --> 11641.279
now that Banks think just like they can

11637.279 --> 11643.560000000001
politically decide who you're going to

11641.279 --> 11649.08
have Financial transactions with like

11643.56 --> 11653.16
that's unprecedented that's where they

11649.08 --> 11655.359
overstep their boundaries as Banks it's

11653.16 --> 11656.279
like no that's absolutely none of your

11655.359 --> 11659.52
damn

11656.279 --> 11663.239
business yeah I mean you can report it

11659.52 --> 11665.76
to the government if you want but you

11663.239 --> 11668.64
shouldn't be even

11665.76 --> 11671.2
capable of determining whether

11668.64 --> 11674.439
transactions happen or not financially

11671.2 --> 11677.68
yeah if somebody does something illegal

11674.439 --> 11679.64
through the bank guess what yeah they're

11677.68 --> 11681.800000000001
not even supposed to be able to stop you

11679.64 --> 11684.199999999999
when you do that they're just supposed

11681.8 --> 11687.88
to riport report it to the government

11684.2 --> 11692.0
afterward so that you get in trouble for

11687.88 --> 11695.399
it they're not supposed to block it

11692.0 --> 11701.08
okay so they're attaining

11695.399 --> 11703.479
these unelected Powers over the

11701.08 --> 11706.12
civilians the banks and that they're not

11703.479 --> 11708.278999999999
supposed to be doing that it is a

11706.12 --> 11711.880000000001
Communist Revolution that they're

11708.279 --> 11714.6
attempting through the financial power

11711.88 --> 11715.759999999998
and it's not going to succeed we know

11714.6 --> 11719.319
it's

11715.76 --> 11722.239
happening you're in big [ __ ] trouble

11719.319 --> 11722.239
this time

11727.439 --> 11734.279
yeah like there's going to be heads

11729.72 --> 11737.319
rolling after this yeah yeah we're not

11734.279 --> 11739.960000000001
nobody's going to like accept that you

11737.319 --> 11743.239
were just trying that you just had to no

11739.96 --> 11745.64
this is a criminal conspiracy and you're

11743.239 --> 11745.64
all

11745.84 --> 11753.16
guilty and that's not going to be

11748.76 --> 11755.72
happening again yeah you those that have

11753.16 --> 11760.039999999999
conspired to do this are not going to be

11755.72 --> 11764.239
let in to attain the Reigns of this

11760.04 --> 11769.239000000001
power again because you have provably

11764.239 --> 11771.319
conspired to abuse that power against

11769.239 --> 11776.479
us

11771.319 --> 11776.479
yeah and that's it that's the end of

11788.319 --> 11793.72
it

11790.0 --> 11795.52
yeah I know B BL it's it's all messed up

11793.72 --> 11797.599999999999
right anyway but I am going to round out

11795.52 --> 11801.04
the show

11797.6 --> 11805.92
though it's been going over 3 hours

11801.04 --> 11807.84
certainly very very variety Rich Show

11805.92 --> 11812.399
with a bit of trolling a bit of

11807.84 --> 11816.76
rowdiness me getting quite angry and

11812.399 --> 11816.76
irritated but also

11817.56 --> 11820.84
yeah good

11821.08 --> 11829.12
insights some stands I made a few

11825.92 --> 11832.479
stands like hey hey oh you think you can

11829.12 --> 11834.479000000001
shame me by saying all the dark world

11832.479 --> 11837.72
it's not real you just made it up like

11834.479 --> 11841.08
you think I really like that actually

11837.72 --> 11844.278999999999
works I mean the only play thing person

11841.08 --> 11844.279
that can work on is

11844.319 --> 11849.239
yourself you know that's the only thing

11847.0 --> 11853.08
that can work on because like I don't

11849.239 --> 11854.439
care whether you believe it or not I

11853.08 --> 11858.239
really don't

11854.439 --> 11863.04
care like I'm in

11858.239 --> 11867.359
it and if you don't believe me then I

11863.04 --> 11869.720000000001
don't care because I'm in it your belief

11867.359 --> 11872.239
has nothing to do with it I'm not acting

11869.72 --> 11874.438999999998
out a certain way just to convince you

11872.239 --> 11875.72
that it's really happening to me I don't

11874.439 --> 11878.399
give a

11875.72 --> 11880.64
[ __ ] it's happening to me what do you

11878.399 --> 11882.08
believe it or not right so that's part

11880.64 --> 11885.399
of this

11882.08 --> 11889.039999999999
show and also we dig through my

11885.399 --> 11891.96
potential Jewish Heritage that's kind of

11889.04 --> 11894.080000000002
been covered up it seems by my grandpa

11891.96 --> 11897.679999999998
but potentially I have a suspicion that

11894.08 --> 11900.6
he might have been a Jew but I yeah I'll

11897.68 --> 11900.6
never really be

11901.64 --> 11907.439
certain but it does feel like there's a

11904.68 --> 11909.52
there's a bit of grabbling in me it's

11907.439 --> 11912.239
just just

11909.52 --> 11915.52
trying just this Spirit that's always

11912.239 --> 11918.399
held strong in my family and anyway I

11915.52 --> 11921.52
talk about it on the show so if you want

11918.399 --> 11923.278999999999
to if you want to just hear about that

11921.52 --> 11927.359
you're just going to have to watch the

11923.279 --> 11927.359
show if you just tune in

11927.64 --> 11930.64
late

11932.399 --> 11939.399

11951.04 --> 11954.04

Beering don't just never grow your

11976.239 --> 11982.359

long what no this is I mean this this is

11982.359 --> 11985.640000000001
already kind of long isn't

11986.52 --> 11993.68
it I mean my sideburns

11990.0 --> 11998.399
are not exactly short you

11993.68 --> 11998.399
know and they'd go on to this

11998.84 --> 12002.84
height but I mean

12006.92 --> 12013.960000000001
yeah that's just what it is

12010.96 --> 12013.96
so

12035.279 --> 12040.439
that's weird Loop what are you taking

12037.88 --> 12042.119999999999
the money for I had that one time too I

12040.439 --> 12043.399
was like taking out a lot of money money

12042.12 --> 12046.04
and they were asking like oh are you

12043.399 --> 12049.479
buying a car with that and I was saying

12046.04 --> 12052.199
like no I'm I'm actually buying gold

12049.479 --> 12052.198999999999
that wasn't

12053.399 --> 12059.16
2008 but yeah when you draw money at the

12056.439 --> 12061.279
bank they do ask you like hey this what

12059.16 --> 12062.96
they just casually ask you like what is

12061.279 --> 12068.04
that

12062.96 --> 12070.399
for and you're not obligated to to tell

12068.04 --> 12072.52
them but they're just counting on that

12070.399 --> 12074.84
you're going to be enthusiastic about it

12072.52 --> 12077.720000000001
enough to just share the information and

12074.84 --> 12077.72
they I did

12077.76 --> 12085.439
so they hated that well the bank clerk

12082.56 --> 12087.479
just thought like oh yeah okay well he

12085.439 --> 12089.800000000001
knew that there was Financial hassle

12087.479 --> 12092.679999999998
going on so he was like oh yeah that's a

12089.8 --> 12096.16
good move so he didn't hate it it was

12092.68 --> 12096.16
just a bank clerk it wasn't the

12097.64 --> 12100.64
manager

12100.84 --> 12106.279
right but it's kind of funny I I did

12103.56 --> 12108.039999999999
make effectively

12106.279 --> 12111.08
like

12108.04 --> 12112.279
€2,000 profit out of this out of that

12111.08 --> 12115.72
one

12112.279 --> 12118.12
transaction overnight it was exactly the

12115.72 --> 12121.198999999999
right timing I bought it and then like

12118.12 --> 12122.76
one week later it it went up like

12121.199 --> 12125.52
25%

12122.76 --> 12128.52
bang that was pretty incredible and kept

12125.52 --> 12130.68
going too right but that was just that

12128.52 --> 12132.76
one time after that I've never had that

12130.68 --> 12135.880000000001
kind of success I tried with silver and

12132.76 --> 12140.6
that completely gave me a loss was

12135.88 --> 12143.599999999999
terrible but the gold in 2008 was great

12140.6 --> 12144.960000000001
I even called into the Alex Jones Show

12143.6 --> 12148.399000000001
about

12144.96 --> 12149.839999999998
it talked about that and about Firefly

12148.399 --> 12152.039999999999
and what a waste it was that they

12149.84 --> 12155.08
discontinued

12152.04 --> 12156.640000000001
it yeah I did call into Alex Jones Show

12155.08 --> 12159.279
in

12156.64 --> 12162.119999999999
2008 when it was real fresh and I was a

12159.279 --> 12166.0
member of prisonplanet.tv

12162.12 --> 12166.0
I spoke with Alex directly it was pretty

12166.16 --> 12171.56
cool can't IM I can't barely believe

12168.8 --> 12173.64
that I actually did that back then but

12171.56 --> 12176.6
yeah I mean I

12173.64 --> 12179.84
did and it was because of his tip that I

12176.6 --> 12179.84
did get to buy

12180.8 --> 12185.64
gold and that I did have that profit out

12183.479 --> 12185.64
of

12186.92 --> 12194.08
it and then later Max sker went oh we're

12189.8 --> 12196.479
going to like oh buy silver and like

12194.08 --> 12198.479
like destroy JP Morgan with it and then

12196.479 --> 12201.278999999999
I was like yeah let's do it and then I

12198.479 --> 12203.88
bought into it and then it didn't

12201.279 --> 12208.319000000001
happen and then the price of silver went

12203.88 --> 12211.319
down and then it's like well

12208.319 --> 12211.319
[ __ ]

12213.64 --> 12220.319
yeah kind of stayed like that ever

12217.08 --> 12223.68
since so yeah I'm not exactly a huge fan

12220.319 --> 12223.68
of Max sker because of that

12226.239 --> 12232.279
well on the other hand it just revealed

12229.08 --> 12234.64
that what we were trying didn't work it

12232.279 --> 12238.560000000001
re that what happened with the silver

12234.64 --> 12240.198999999999
market then showed that it's completely

12238.56 --> 12244.119999999999
controlled

12240.199 --> 12245.399000000001
like it's not a free market it's a fake

12244.12 --> 12249.319000000001
free

12245.399 --> 12252.68
market silver market is completely fake

12249.319 --> 12257.68
it's not a realistic representative of

12252.68 --> 12257.68
actual silver at all it's completely

12258.76 --> 12265.92
fake it seems like they've done with the

12262.0 --> 12268.6
silver market something that really does

12265.92 --> 12271.52
reminiscent what has been done with the

12268.6 --> 12274.68
diamond Market in the 20th

12271.52 --> 12278.52
century how they made it into a short

12274.68 --> 12281.319
shortage system it seems like that has

12278.52 --> 12283.800000000001
secretly been done with silver except

12281.319 --> 12288.319
they do the exact opposite they kept it

12283.8 --> 12293.438999999998
artificially low and like they can keep

12288.319 --> 12296.278999999999
it artificially low no matter what which

12293.439 --> 12296.279
is completely

12296.359 --> 12301.399000000001
insane so it's it's like a shortage

12299.399 --> 12303.479
system that they did with diamonds

12301.399 --> 12307.399
except they do the exact

12303.479 --> 12310.0
opposite so they ensure that the price

12307.399 --> 12312.8
can't go

12310.0 --> 12315.319
up artificial

12312.8 --> 12319.16
it's weird but that's what they've done

12315.319 --> 12319.16
and it it will remain like

12319.64 --> 12326.278999999999
that like if they hadn't done it then

12322.239 --> 12330.039999999999
silver would potentially be worth three

12326.279 --> 12332.640000000001
to four times what it's worth right

12330.04 --> 12334.640000000001
now something like that because I mean

12332.64 --> 12336.599999999999
there's just massive amount of money

12334.64 --> 12340.72
printing that has happened exponentially

12336.6 --> 12342.84
growth grown and like logically those

12340.72 --> 12346.039999999999
prices would then be climbing to that

12342.84 --> 12350.16
point they don't because they're being

12346.04 --> 12350.160000000002
perpetually kept artificially

12350.279 --> 12356.76
low and that's what we learned back then

12353.56 --> 12359.76
when we tried that Max Kaiser burn the

12356.76 --> 12361.399
JP Morgan Down thing buy all silver to

12359.76 --> 12364.6
make them crash because they got put

12361.399 --> 12368.119999999999
options on Silver and we try to make

12364.6 --> 12371.199
them crash and it just didn't work that

12368.12 --> 12372.800000000001
was crazy it was crazy it just didn't

12371.199 --> 12375.199
work

12372.8 --> 12378.239
that it should have worked it didn't

12375.199 --> 12381.960000000001
work because it turns out that entire

12378.239 --> 12386.16
Market is completely

12381.96 --> 12386.16
rig and that was 10 years

12387.3 --> 12390.5
[Music]

12395.6 --> 12398.6
ago

12400.399 --> 12403.399
yeah

12407.72 --> 12411.599999999999
right anyway I still wanted to mention

12409.96 --> 12414.08
that and I'm really going to round out

12411.6 --> 12414.08
the show

12415.239 --> 12419.439
