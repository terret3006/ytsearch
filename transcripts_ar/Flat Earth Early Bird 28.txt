1.53 --> 8.769
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.11 --> 14.530000000000001
early-bird number 28 I'm your host

8.769 --> 20.529
Arwen yes starting out today again this

14.53 --> 26.918999999999997
usual it's a pretty nice day it's a bit

20.529 --> 29.98
loud but it's not so cold so yeah up and

26.919 --> 33.43
down up and down but on average it's

29.98 --> 40.0
been a pretty mild winter so far I have

33.43 --> 45.129999999999995
no objections with that so let's see who

40.0 --> 49.12
isn't yet Sean Hutton Fe news hm

45.13 --> 62.050000000000004
Ivanhoe Escobar Nicholas Daniel and Dan

49.12 --> 65.4
a matrix media hello everyone yeah I

62.05 --> 68.35
furred just been watching the livestream

65.4 --> 69.94000000000001
I put a link out and chat pretty early

68.35 --> 75.55
on if you scroll up you could probably

69.94 --> 80.67999999999999
find it of the new latest SpaceX launch

75.55 --> 85.75
and it was freaking hilarious it keeps

80.68 --> 88.33000000000001
on restreaming itself but it was kind of

85.75 --> 91.659
entertaining at all and but the usual

88.33 --> 96.1
and there were just these really silly

91.659 --> 99.10000000000001
fish Islands errors or basically the

96.1 --> 102.46
angle of the camera facing earth would

99.1 --> 104.64999999999999
be changing angle and then suddenly yeah

102.46 --> 109.61999999999999
there's basically one craft and they had

104.65 --> 112.86000000000001
two shots from two sides as it were and

109.62 --> 116.14
yeah at first it all look yeah pretty

112.86 --> 120.34
spiracle but then it started turning and

116.14 --> 122.47
on one side the image became very much

120.34 --> 125.2
flat like the surface became flat then

122.47 --> 130.179
switches again turns into bloke like me

125.2 --> 133.34
very much lobe like very local very

130.179 --> 135.95
globe look kind of weird

133.34 --> 139.56900000000002
and then in a nod that then that stuff

135.95 --> 142.819
went away and then you see like a

139.569 --> 145.45899999999997
another detached thing and it looks

142.819 --> 147.319
really cool yeah Wow how do how did they

145.459 --> 152.269
do it but yeah if you look carefully on

147.319 --> 154.31
the Left I don't know why they even made

152.269 --> 158.72
this error but on the left you see like

154.31 --> 161.239
this very seriously concave piece of

158.72 --> 164.18
Earth it's kind of over lit so if you

161.239 --> 165.68
don't really look at it then you might

164.18 --> 168.489
not even realize what you're looking at

165.68 --> 171.38
there but yeah that's the Overland

168.489 --> 174.31900000000002
surface of the earth concaving very

171.38 --> 178.849
seriously so all these silly things in

174.319 --> 181.79
there and little on purpose joke I guess

178.849 --> 184.97
or I don't know what it is but yeah they

181.79 --> 187.19
used it's a SpaceX launch so it landed

184.97 --> 189.23
again and then something went wrong with

187.19 --> 191.54
the controls and they cut off the

189.23 --> 193.849
footage but yeah I didn't answer and on

191.54 --> 198.56
the platform splash ended to disease

193.849 --> 202.459
it's a nice distraction but yeah I don't

198.56 --> 211.88
know as entertainment value I guess it's

202.459 --> 215.9
it wasn't that bad but the flaws were

211.88 --> 218.69
very apparent anyway that what that's

215.9 --> 226.459
what I was watching is right before the

218.69 --> 232.94
show hello Wesley Stace and flat earth

226.459 --> 242.93
News Talk David Reed its Ann Oakley John

232.94 --> 249.079
Hutten good to see you guys so yeah that

242.93 --> 252.59
was funny and to be honest there were

249.079 --> 254.56900000000002
some people there were like some shields

252.59 --> 258.109
in the chat there that were obviously

254.569 --> 260.45
just shouting and they almost seemed to

258.109 --> 263.479
repeat themselves almost to the to the

260.45 --> 265.969
letter in the live chat during the

263.479 --> 267.26
restreams that was kind of funny but

265.969 --> 269.74
there were also some people

267.26 --> 272.63
they're just like really admiring it and

269.74 --> 274.67
yeah I had to really I just compulsively

272.63 --> 277.01
had to point at those flaws that I just

274.67 --> 280.16
described but I almost felt guilty

277.01 --> 282.13
towards these people because they just

280.16 --> 289.1
left that there

282.13 --> 293.71
yeah so I almost start to feel guilty

289.1 --> 297.65000000000003
like should we be chat trolling them I

293.71 --> 301.64
know it's funny no we like to wake

297.65 --> 302.81
people up but people that really there

301.64 --> 307.13
are some people out there that just

302.81 --> 311.2
choose like no I don't want to I don't

307.13 --> 311.2
want to know about that so

311.5 --> 317.75
should we even force it upon these

314.42 --> 324.73
people or like constantly confront them

317.75 --> 328.04
with it it's it's kind of a a loaded

324.73 --> 333.35
question I guess but you know most it

328.04 --> 337.64000000000004
would almost feel like a pro-life crowd

333.35 --> 340.18
like really mobbing an abortion clinic

337.64 --> 343.82
and people that want to go in there like

340.18 --> 345.8
yeah there's of course there is logical

343.82 --> 348.94
or there is reason for them to do it

345.8 --> 352.04
spiritual reasons religious reasons

348.94 --> 354.05
yeah ethical heart and get me about the

352.04 --> 360.02000000000004
ethics but still it is harassment and it

354.05 --> 362.33
is free choice thing and oh now it's

360.02 --> 366.16999999999996
that's way more loaded than this I guess

362.33 --> 368.71999999999997
or loathe in another way but yeah should

366.17 --> 372.47
we be harassing people that are gonna

368.72 --> 377.51000000000005
get there just to be amused with the

372.47 --> 379.61
space fantasy you know they don't all

377.51 --> 384.4
have to be the evil people know that

379.61 --> 384.40000000000003
just enjoying the fantasy I don't know

385.87 --> 391.46
complex issues anyway everyone's gonna

390.08 --> 396.02
do what they're gonna do anyway

391.46 --> 397.01
and people worldwide in all regions are

396.02 --> 400.90999999999997
getting used to

397.01 --> 401.27
trolling so we have to keep in mind that

400.91 --> 403.82000000000005
if

401.27 --> 407.47999999999996
do it a lot the people that really just

403.82 --> 411.68
want to leave are just kind of

407.48 --> 414.59000000000003
regardless as trolls and ignore us like

411.68 --> 416.15000000000003
even the young kids may just be taught

414.59 --> 418.01
about the others trolls out there the

416.15 --> 423.85999999999996
flat earth is and just don't listen to

418.01 --> 428.23
him I don't know maybe I'm taking this

423.86 --> 428.23
bit too to series I don't know

433.84 --> 445.06
hmm anyway with all the trolls that we

440.02 --> 447.60999999999996
get I guess for a lot of people it will

445.06 --> 449.02
be almost like a payback like yeah if

447.61 --> 452.68
you're going to show me then I'm gonna

449.02 --> 456.47999999999996
troll everyone on your site but yeah

452.68 --> 460.6
over generalizations again you know

456.48 --> 466.99
still believe that it's best not to do

460.6 --> 470.29
harm and when you think there's no other

466.99 --> 473.169
way to accomplish something then you've

470.29 --> 476.53000000000003
probably not thought a little deeper a

473.169 --> 479.10999999999996
little wider cause every time I do

476.53 --> 484.85999999999996
something I can always figure out a way

479.11 --> 484.86
to do something peaceful you know

488.82 --> 494.65
Ted just have to tame your ego in that

491.65 --> 497.73999999999995
because the ego especially when you're

494.65 --> 501.45
agitated it just wants the confrontation

497.74 --> 504.01
just makes you not really care anymore

501.45 --> 507.21999999999997
but if you're gonna hurt feelings or the

504.01 --> 510.31
consequences potentially depending on

507.22 --> 512.349
how strong that impulse is I just try to

510.31 --> 515.169
avoid it as much as possible yeah I get

512.349 --> 518.4100000000001
flared up sometimes especially when I

515.169 --> 521.3199999999999
just sometimes I get like allergic

518.41 --> 527.5
responses to certain controls and that's

521.32 --> 530.6500000000001
personal and I don't obsess over that

527.5 --> 533.38
kind of thing so I just let it out and

530.65 --> 535.3299999999999
then I let it sink down and it doesn't

533.38 --> 543.07
touch me anymore so that's a much

535.33 --> 549.5200000000001
healthier way to deal with it and that

543.07 --> 552.37
way you can even have a somewhat

549.52 --> 557.1899999999999
constructive relation up to a certain

552.37 --> 559.33
degree with your perceived opponents and

557.19 --> 563.8000000000001
potentially work towards a better

559.33 --> 569.74
understanding better peace you know it

563.8 --> 573.7299999999999
yeah I don't know it it all depends on

569.74 --> 579.13
what you can tolerate and I see it as a

573.73 --> 583.09
test because you can train being

579.13 --> 586.78
tolerant it's just very important that

583.09 --> 591.64
you don't irrationally do so because

586.78 --> 594.36
that also harms yourself and Wow you

591.64 --> 594.36
know how that works

600.86 --> 604.82
nice a crowded in chat

613.82 --> 624.1700000000001
I yeah I think just working a lot many

620.15 --> 626.9599999999999
dangers and Dragons stuff so the moments

624.17 --> 630.0799999999999
of rest sometimes when there's a lot

626.96 --> 632.36
happening on the scene then it occupies

630.08 --> 634.7
my mind a lot and like especially with

632.36 --> 637.73
new development so I will on the fly be

634.7 --> 640.49
able to talk about that there's other

637.73 --> 643.6700000000001
things happening but it's not really my

640.49 --> 645.59
department it feels and I'm just waiting

643.67 --> 649.3399999999999
for certain people to contact me so I

645.59 --> 654.65
can just break loose in any questions

649.34 --> 657.4100000000001
that I have for those people well

654.65 --> 660.35
everybody knows I I've asked them

657.41 --> 664.25
publicly in the debates and on this show

660.35 --> 667.4
to come and join me or contact me or

664.25 --> 669.17
anything and other than that yeah now if

667.4 --> 671.42
I fall back I'm just gonna drift off

669.17 --> 674.4499999999999
like oh yeah I was working on this or

671.42 --> 680.27
working on that and just like details

674.45 --> 683.5300000000001
and B&D that it's just gonna be nerd to

680.27 --> 683.53
talk to a lot of people

706.44 --> 709.129
right

711.56 --> 720.3499999999999
questions tried sorry for the the be too

718.31 --> 722.81
long break yeah if you guys got

720.35 --> 726.1990000000001
questions I'm always up for questions

722.81 --> 728.5999999999999
and answers as H a.m. puts it if he was

726.199 --> 733.12
addressing somebody but no wait

728.6 --> 736.9300000000001
peanuts Clark asks if you could join

733.12 --> 736.93

758.37 --> 762.05
okay I gave you the link

764.09 --> 771.44
and for anybody else sees this there's

769.04 --> 776.54
also of course a link in the master B

771.44 --> 779.09
and the flutters earlybird chat so if

776.54 --> 787.3299999999999
you're in there you can always get in

779.09 --> 787.33
here at a moment's notice if you want so

793.42 --> 796.1999999999999
see

802.94 --> 805.6
hmm

811.68 --> 816.019
good morning can you hear me hey yes I

815.339 --> 821.369
can

816.019 --> 824.61
are you doing man doing good yeah yes

821.369 --> 830.509
started indeed yeah I'm always full of

824.61 --> 833.97
energy during this time although yeah

830.509 --> 836.91
it's what's not a mess like getting

833.97 --> 838.4390000000001
figuring things to talk about that's

836.91 --> 843.569
another matter

838.439 --> 848.24
so what yeah what brings you here well I

843.569 --> 851.0999999999999
uh I just woke up not too long ago and

848.24 --> 855.42
just saw that you were on and I've never

851.1 --> 857.279
been on the early bird show so uh just

855.42 --> 862.5889999999999
came just came to give you some company

857.279 --> 867.749
and I guess I I guess I wanted to just

862.589 --> 869.4290000000001
wanted to ask you right like I tried to

867.749 --> 874.74
talk I tried to talk to people around me

869.429 --> 878.1
I try to I don't try to come on too

874.74 --> 880.92
strong I try to try to ask questions you

878.1 --> 883.23
know like how can I prove something to

880.92 --> 884.91
myself how can i you know without using

883.23 --> 891.389
Big Daddy government how can I prove

884.91 --> 895.23
this you know and it's it's just hard

891.389 --> 896.819
cuz it gets frustrating because people

895.23 --> 898.9200000000001
people just don't they don't want to

896.819 --> 901.8
look into it they don't they don't care

898.92 --> 904.16
because if it doesn't change their David

901.8 --> 907.019
oh they haven't learned to care about

904.16 --> 910.17
critical thinking they've been

907.019 --> 912.509
deconditioned to do that they get ahead

910.17 --> 916.9799999999999
by just training and by learning things

912.509 --> 919.019
by heart and following the narrative so

916.98 --> 920.85
yeah critical thought gets in the way

919.019 --> 925.559
because then you suddenly have to judge

920.85 --> 930.929
all the things you're doing see all

925.559 --> 933.54
right and it's it's hard because it's

930.929 --> 937.04
you want you just want people to

933.54 --> 939.8389999999999
investigate because you know but I

937.04 --> 943.5889999999999
didn't really have anybody come up to me

939.839 --> 945.1500000000001
and tell me about it if he you know I I

943.589 --> 948.1500000000001
found it on my own

945.15 --> 951.63
organically you know but don't you

948.15 --> 954.3299999999999
sometimes I found myself sorry sorry

951.63 --> 956.55
this always happens if a guest comes on

954.33 --> 963.0300000000001
our halfway interrupt you and now start

956.55 --> 965.0999999999999
talking I talk I talk really flow sorry

963.03 --> 970.23
I'm just like that it's terrible habit

965.1 --> 973.1700000000001
but it does produce but you know I have

970.23 --> 975.6
no trouble really figuring out the right

973.17 --> 979.88
people to break flat earth because it's

975.6 --> 983.34
always the ones that are already digging

979.88 --> 986.88
so I always test out like water

983.34 --> 990.0300000000001
are you a conspiracy thinker are you

986.88 --> 992.76
interested in anything like you can even

990.03 --> 994.8199999999999
start out with the aliens or because

992.76 --> 998.1
those are already typical mainstream

994.82 --> 1000.2900000000001
subjects almost so that's really not

998.1 --> 1003.8000000000001
awkward anybody has an opinion on that

1000.29 --> 1005.0899999999999
like anybody even really stupid so what

1003.8 --> 1006.4699999999999
you can always start out and just

1005.09 --> 1009.02
upgrade like yeah what do you think

1006.47 --> 1013.87
about 9/11 and then go into conspiracy

1009.02 --> 1018.1999999999999
world and Illuminati probably and then

1013.87 --> 1020.36
about mind control and about how

1018.2 --> 1022.4300000000001
widespread the false flags could be if

1020.36 --> 1024.68
they already got that ladies you'd build

1022.43 --> 1026.51
up the layers you don't have to do it

1024.68 --> 1028.16
all in one go but it all depends on how

1026.51 --> 1031.76
quick the mind of the person is you're

1028.16 --> 1034.94
talking with and eventually they'll draw

1031.76 --> 1037.1
the line and a lot of the times that

1034.94 --> 1042.25
line will be flat earth when you

1037.1 --> 1044.9299999999998
eventually drop that in but sometimes

1042.25 --> 1046.7
though it's usually those people that

1044.93 --> 1049.0700000000002
are already digging that are naturally

1046.7 --> 1051.0800000000002
curious that are really the only ones

1049.07 --> 1054.8
that have any business of you in

1051.08 --> 1059.0
learning about Flat Earth that in my

1054.8 --> 1061.28
opinion burn so if I don't have two

1059.0 --> 1063.98
worlds then the knowledge will just be

1061.28 --> 1067.1299999999999
confusing to them and they'll probably

1063.98 --> 1069.47
forget it or if they will be burdened by

1067.13 --> 1071.3600000000001
it because yes and they they're live in

1069.47 --> 1073.88
the world that's all fake to them and

1071.36 --> 1076.9399999999998
they don't know how to deal with it they

1073.88 --> 1078.5100000000002
don't have the skills see that can also

1076.94 --> 1080.67
be a problem

1078.51 --> 1083.28
and that's that's another thing that our

1080.67 --> 1087.68
that I wondered because I don't I don't

1083.28 --> 1090.24
want to create anxiety for people mm-hmm

1087.68 --> 1094.8600000000001
and sometimes when I'm talking to people

1090.24 --> 1098.52
I I feel like I was trying to tell them

1094.86 --> 1100.4699999999998
that their whole life is a lie and then

1098.52 --> 1102.69
I start wondering I'm like can't tell

1100.47 --> 1104.58
that you can never say that to anyone

1102.69 --> 1106.98
well of course I would never say that

1104.58 --> 1109.29
but I'm thinking that in my mind oh

1106.98 --> 1112.29
that's the feeling that's the sensation

1109.29 --> 1114.12
right it's like you're it almost feels

1112.29 --> 1116.25
like yeah you're destroying somebody's

1114.12 --> 1118.32
spiritual life all the the anchors that

1116.25 --> 1121.05
they're resting on whether they know it

1118.32 --> 1122.97
or not and sometimes there's a lot of

1121.05 --> 1126.3899999999999
sentimental value attached for them

1122.97 --> 1130.1000000000001
personally like it wasn't me or just

1126.39 --> 1133.38
just Fernan for an example the the

1130.1 --> 1137.28
people that are I work around there

1133.38 --> 1140.13
they're really into football and one

1137.28 --> 1140.75
sorry they're really into football right

1140.13 --> 1144.3300000000002
right

1140.75 --> 1146.61
sports you know and American football or

1144.33 --> 1151.23
yeah American football right not not

1146.61 --> 1152.6399999999999
soccer and that's all they talk about

1151.23 --> 1156.89
it's all you think about

1152.64 --> 1161.8400000000001
yeah you know and I see them

1156.89 --> 1161.8400000000001
communicating and talking and I see them

1161.87 --> 1165.9599999999998
with bright smiles on their faces you

1164.49 --> 1167.64
know while they're talking about it and

1165.96 --> 1170.01
they're excited and they're it's

1167.64 --> 1171.8700000000001
something they enjoy yeah and they have

1170.01 --> 1174.72
oversight they have control

1171.87 --> 1176.9399999999998
the rules are clear and there's a lot of

1174.72 --> 1183.57
people to talk about it that are also

1176.94 --> 1185.94
specialize in yeah sometimes like I

1183.57 --> 1189.0
don't want to break that for that person

1185.94 --> 1190.6200000000001
like if that person is happy right I

1189.0 --> 1193.56
don't I don't want to mess that up I

1190.62 --> 1196.86
don't want to be the reason of creating

1193.56 --> 1198.72
anxiety in that person mine mm-hmm so

1196.86 --> 1203.52
it's it's like it's like a catch-22

1198.72 --> 1204.75
because I'm trying to explain something

1203.52 --> 1210.52
to somebody or I'm trying to get

1204.75 --> 1215.05
somebody to investigate but

1210.52 --> 1219.58
I could be also breaking their paradigm

1215.05 --> 1221.1399999999999
you know well their worldview well just

1219.58 --> 1223.36
don't break it all at once

1221.14 --> 1225.43
that's how there are so many ways to

1223.36 --> 1228.34
approach this there there's all kinds of

1225.43 --> 1233.3100000000002
relations with space and NASA that

1228.34 --> 1241.08
people can have for the average person

1233.31 --> 1243.82
it is just a a dream like a sum yeah

1241.08 --> 1246.28
sounds really sentimental but can be

1243.82 --> 1248.8899999999999
like a hope like yeah at least there

1246.28 --> 1251.46
some good in humanity or something no or

1248.89 --> 1254.5
something like that but there are other

1251.46 --> 1256.69
for example more rich people that just

1254.5 --> 1259.09
really love it and don't really realize

1256.69 --> 1261.6100000000001
that it's real um they're kind of waste

1259.09 --> 1266.35
a lot of money on it and then you've got

1261.61 --> 1268.8999999999999
to see like okay like how much are they

1266.35 --> 1270.9699999999998
really trying to do the right thing that

1268.9 --> 1273.01
they're really putting all their good

1270.97 --> 1275.44
energy into it and basically just not

1273.01 --> 1278.02
realizing they're being fooled or they

1275.44 --> 1281.3500000000001
just like it as a hobby and it doesn't

1278.02 --> 1283.06
really matter because yeah then it will

1281.35 --> 1284.8
matter a lot if you wake somebody up

1283.06 --> 1286.6599999999999
like that they may be shocked in their

1284.8 --> 1289.93
life will be changed forever if they

1286.66 --> 1292.3000000000002
like really are into it with ideology

1289.93 --> 1294.22
and they their colleagues involving this

1292.3 --> 1300.8799999999999
have been fooling them because yeah that

1294.22 --> 1302.23
happens you know maybe uh maybe Effie

1300.88 --> 1303.97
just isn't for everybody

1302.23 --> 1308.41
you know maybe some people just are

1303.97 --> 1314.07
meant to well it is just a piece of

1308.41 --> 1314.0700000000002
knowledge and for some people it is

1314.64 --> 1323.2900000000002
because it's so big and it is so complex

1318.24 --> 1326.56
it gives room to it gives a big hobby to

1323.29 --> 1330.01
a certain level of intelligent people

1326.56 --> 1332.71
and the funny thing is you can grade it

1330.01 --> 1335.17
down and it'll still work so anybody

1332.71 --> 1336.67
that is enthusiastic about it can do

1335.17 --> 1338.71
something with it that's just

1336.67 --> 1340.93
interesting even in the artistic their

1338.71 --> 1342.54
angle you know there's so much you can

1340.93 --> 1344.8600000000001
do with it on any level

1342.54 --> 1348.04
but for a lot of really intelligent

1344.86 --> 1351.58
people it can be like Dungeons & Dragons

1348.04 --> 1354.1599999999999
is to me which is a huge hobby that you

1351.58 --> 1360.34
take very fanatically serious in a

1354.16 --> 1362.89
certain way and yeah because society

1360.34 --> 1365.05
they can't adapt to society properly

1362.89 --> 1367.42
using their intelligence this suddenly

1365.05 --> 1369.82
is that relief of where you finally can

1367.42 --> 1373.42
apply your skill as it were and that is

1369.82 --> 1376.1499999999999
kind of what it is to me because I've

1373.42 --> 1380.04
been feeling trapped for a long time

1376.15 --> 1384.16
like yeah what do I do with this world

1380.04 --> 1393.309
and it's learning so much through flat

1384.16 --> 1396.0
earth so definitely it it feels it feels

1393.309 --> 1398.23
like it opened it opened up the door for

1396.0 --> 1402.25
just many other things kind of like

1398.23 --> 1405.01
you're saying and I I kind of I did

1402.25 --> 1409.27
something for myself around my local

1405.01 --> 1411.25
community and not a joy it's a gate it's

1409.27 --> 1414.1299999999999
not just a door you know you can open

1411.25 --> 1416.62
the door this is obtained or this is

1414.13 --> 1421.0
like a door that opens so many other

1416.62 --> 1423.9699999999998
doors true that's the thing like if you

1421.0 --> 1426.4
open it yeah you can't just casually

1423.97 --> 1431.4
walk through it and think everything is

1426.4 --> 1434.17
gonna remain the same because yeah

1431.4 --> 1443.5900000000001
you'll bump into so many things all of a

1434.17 --> 1448.51
sudden sorry well I was just going to

1443.59 --> 1451.78
say I I what I met my local grocery

1448.51 --> 1455.83
store or when I'm out doing something

1451.78 --> 1459.1
you know oh very very nicely you know

1455.83 --> 1461.05
just say hey to somebody you know I'll

1459.1 --> 1464.79
ask them you know hey what do you what

1461.05 --> 1467.9199999999998
do you think about geoengineering and I

1464.79 --> 1472.9189999999999
telling you I asked about 20 people and

1467.92 --> 1475.04
only one person even knew what that was

1472.919 --> 1477.3500000000001
and

1475.04 --> 1481.1
yeah just nobody had nobody has a clue

1477.35 --> 1482.9299999999998
man nobody everybody's so busy with

1481.1 --> 1486.8899999999999
their occupation

1482.93 --> 1487.76
I'll keep you occupied you know what I

1486.89 --> 1490.64
mean mm-hmm

1487.76 --> 1492.83
no camp burials is one of these and

1490.64 --> 1499.0700000000002
chemtrails and geoengineering is one of

1492.83 --> 1503.09
the conspiracy subjects that's been very

1499.07 --> 1504.77
suppressed despite it being yeah a lot

1503.09 --> 1508.04
of people being interested it's one of

1504.77 --> 1512.66
the most systems suppressed subjects

1508.04 --> 1518.3
this century while so many other typical

1512.66 --> 1521.8100000000002
subjects have been fully served our full

1518.3 --> 1524.8999999999999
mainstreamed that have become common law

1521.81 --> 1527.72
and but chemtrails even though it is

1524.9 --> 1530.45
kind of known it still remains like yeah

1527.72 --> 1534.32
this is big trouble because obviously

1530.45 --> 1538.39
people with planes and power are doing

1534.32 --> 1542.51
that and how do we even deal with that

1538.39 --> 1547.76
if they keep everything since I mean it

1542.51 --> 1550.31
to me it's pure evil I mean I hate it

1547.76 --> 1553.81
well we don't know the problem is we

1550.31 --> 1558.02
don't know and if you are the evil then

1553.81 --> 1560.12
yeah it will even get worse for you but

1558.02 --> 1562.55
yet your engineering doesn't necessarily

1560.12 --> 1566.03
have to be evil but yeah they can abuse

1562.55 --> 1567.86
it to spray chemical crap that's really

1566.03 --> 1570.56
bad for your even disease or whatever

1567.86 --> 1573.31
they want and they are doing this in

1570.56 --> 1576.2
some places but I don't think that all

1573.31 --> 1579.25
everywhere it was happiness I'm not

1576.2 --> 1582.41
entirely sure I think there is some

1579.25 --> 1587.6
benevolent geoengineering also being

1582.41 --> 1591.22
applied but there's obvious malevolent

1587.6 --> 1591.2199999999998
geoengineering happening as well

1591.64 --> 1594.8490000000002
[Music]

1597.71 --> 1606.659
it is weird I am on November 27th they

1603.419 --> 1609.24
are they actually came in and came out

1606.659 --> 1611.19
and admitted there's an article with

1609.24 --> 1611.61
Scott David Keith and if you know who

1611.19 --> 1616.1100000000001
that is

1611.61 --> 1618.12
and they basically admitted that there

1616.11 --> 1624.9189999999999
they are going to started dimming the

1618.12 --> 1626.1299999999999
Sun nobody everybody nobody cared like I

1624.919 --> 1629.2990000000002
care

1626.13 --> 1631.74
a liar well of course we care but yachty

1629.299 --> 1633.75
they basically admitted a hey real

1631.74 --> 1636.96
doctor spreading ragnarok or something

1633.75 --> 1639.12
is that what they really want you need

1636.96 --> 1646.8890000000001
to see that this doesn't make any damn

1639.12 --> 1649.889
sense it just blows my mind that you

1646.889 --> 1652.2299999999998
know big just because if I Declassified

1649.889 --> 1655.83
geoengineering yeah we can do a lot of

1652.23 --> 1661.44
[ __ ] so let's get some rules and just

1655.83 --> 1663.809
use it as an emergency device like okay

1661.44 --> 1666.24
there's some serious storms gonna happen

1663.809 --> 1669.36
let's make sure that doesn't happen or

1666.24 --> 1671.629
okay this area is in dire need of some

1669.36 --> 1676.11
rain how can we make that happen without

1671.629 --> 1683.24
causing Cataclysm see like like

1676.11 --> 1687.09
California clean just use it publicly

1683.24 --> 1692.85
you know you think you think California

1687.09 --> 1696.049
could use some rain you think they could

1692.85 --> 1700.98
do it and it would just get like serious

1696.049 --> 1704.759
rainstorm in in the time span of two

1700.98 --> 1708.21
days maybe you could you do that

1704.759 --> 1710.309
although yeah it would probably give

1708.21 --> 1712.44
unpredicted alterations because that's

1710.309 --> 1714.269
never done before so they don't know

1712.44 --> 1717.72
what the consequences of that's gonna be

1714.269 --> 1720.139
for me what the side effects are that's

1717.72 --> 1722.8500000000001
yeah that's how that works

1720.139 --> 1725.49
you mean there's never been a long-term

1722.85 --> 1727.32
experiment done not like that not in

1725.49 --> 1728.97
that region it's different in every

1727.32 --> 1729.54
region every time you do something like

1728.97 --> 1732.77
this

1729.54 --> 1735.8999999999999
right because it is all a network of

1732.77 --> 1737.87
energies it's like a web and if you're

1735.9 --> 1742.89
gonna do something like create a pulse

1737.87 --> 1745.29
or dim an effect yeah you need to see

1742.89 --> 1747.5700000000002
what happens as a result of that before

1745.29 --> 1751.08
you know what happens with all of that

1747.57 --> 1752.61
and I've never heard of like a giant

1751.08 --> 1755.9099999999999
rainstorm so I'll be breaking out in

1752.61 --> 1758.61
California never heard of that so they

1755.91 --> 1760.0500000000002
obviously haven't done it before so they

1758.61 --> 1762.2099999999998
don't know what the consequences may be

1760.05 --> 1768.8999999999999
they're afraid that it's gonna have very

1762.21 --> 1771.72
serious impact or something but even

1768.9 --> 1775.23
then it's ridiculous because when when

1771.72 --> 1777.83
water is concerned they could just in

1775.23 --> 1782.67
California build giant desalination

1777.83 --> 1786.78
plants and just get water pumping from

1782.67 --> 1789.47
the ocean into wherever they want create

1786.78 --> 1793.77
an artificial water reservoirs even oh

1789.47 --> 1797.79
yeah I started a drought is completely

1793.77 --> 1799.8899999999999
unnecessary I after reading that article

1797.79 --> 1802.92
about them giving the Sun I started

1799.89 --> 1806.39
thinking about uh you know what if what

1802.92 --> 1811.41
if there was a period of time to where

1806.39 --> 1814.71
we never we never saw the Sun and I

1811.41 --> 1817.1000000000001
think I think after a while I think we

1814.71 --> 1821.22
would be begging for the Sun to rise

1817.1 --> 1824.07
yeah I think we would go crazy if the

1821.22 --> 1827.01
Sun didn't rise now everybody would get

1824.07 --> 1831.09
sick right yeah cuz you're something

1827.01 --> 1833.42
yeah you don't get the proper elements

1831.09 --> 1836.9099999999999
by the way the rest of the world as well

1833.42 --> 1838.44
think of how many plants sadly are gonna

1836.91 --> 1840.24
start yeah

1838.44 --> 1843.45
fungus outbreak that's what's gonna

1840.24 --> 1845.34
happen giant fungus outbreak in the

1843.45 --> 1847.29
entire plant world oh yeah you're right

1845.34 --> 1850.7099999999998
I didn't think about fungus I sure will

1847.29 --> 1853.62
grow yeah that's also the fungus is part

1850.71 --> 1860.42
of the system but there's no sunlight to

1853.62 --> 1860.4199999999998
tame it then yeah it's gonna take over

1863.01 --> 1869.08
with the type of fungi that are out

1865.63 --> 1871.6000000000001
there right now because yeah fungi have

1869.08 --> 1876.81
went in all directions and they're very

1871.6 --> 1880.4199999999998
strong aggressive fungi out there now so

1876.81 --> 1886.81
it's not a good thing don't freaking dim

1880.42 --> 1888.5700000000002
the Sun don't do it at all there's other

1886.81 --> 1893.44
ways of dealing with it you can even

1888.57 --> 1900.37
create day/night weather programs if you

1893.44 --> 1902.2
like you know I just I think I think

1900.37 --> 1904.6
there really are gonna play this

1902.2 --> 1907.39
environmental card all this maybe

1904.6 --> 1912.1499999999999
they're gonna blame this think about it

1907.39 --> 1915.3100000000002
it is pretty doable I think I think

1912.15 --> 1922.24
probably in reality not really so just

1915.31 --> 1926.74
make sure that that it always during the

1922.24 --> 1929.5
day is sunny as unclouded as possible

1926.74 --> 1932.98
and that during the evening then you

1929.5 --> 1936.16
spray whatever as the least damaging

1932.98 --> 1938.44
type of particles that will create ring

1936.16 --> 1940.0900000000001
and then during the night it can rain

1938.44 --> 1943.66
and everything can remove sure eyes

1940.09 --> 1946.1799999999998
that's like the optimal weather pattern

1943.66 --> 1948.97
that for life because then you get the

1946.18 --> 1952.72
full Sun and you get plenty of rain so

1948.97 --> 1954.79
there's not a really good route so yeah

1952.72 --> 1957.45
if you want a Geoengineer to improve the

1954.79 --> 1961.53
world then try a pattern like that I

1957.45 --> 1961.53
think they already notice

1966.26 --> 1973.02
so uh so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna

1970.26 --> 1976.17
get real conspiratorial yeah I'm gonna

1973.02 --> 1980.1
ask I'm gonna ask you something sure so

1976.17 --> 1982.02
uh I'm not saying that I'm not saying

1980.1 --> 1984.27
that I then I believe this or I think

1982.02 --> 1986.1
this but what do you what do you think

1984.27 --> 1989.12
about a Sun simulator what do you think

1986.1 --> 1993.12
about something in front of the song a

1989.12 --> 1996.8999999999999
Sun simulator yeah something in front of

1993.12 --> 1999.4499999999998
listen what what do you mean something

1996.9 --> 2004.94
in front of the Sun mm-hmm like like

1999.45 --> 2012.5
possibly a Fresnel lens possibly an

2004.94 --> 2015.14
artificial Sun well I guess I'm guessing

2012.5 --> 2018.08
you heaven look what creates the

2015.14 --> 2023.18
daylights look maybe it's possible if it

2018.08 --> 2027.1999999999998
is if it is electrical-based if there is

2023.18 --> 2029.75
like this high electricity clouds the

2027.2 --> 2034.1000000000001
high tension cloud up there as it were

2029.75 --> 2035.63
of just energy that is creating this

2034.1 --> 2038.03
daylight through

2035.63 --> 2043.0700000000002
yeah the junction points of the energy

2038.03 --> 2045.29
information block the weave then yeah if

2043.07 --> 2048.889
you could simulate that in this smaller

2045.29 --> 2053.389
scale yeah maybe you could create an

2048.889 --> 2057.77
artificial Sun with a certain cycle in a

2053.389 --> 2059.7200000000003
in a very specific region yeah if they

2057.77 --> 2063.32
mastered that technology yeah yeah they

2059.72 --> 2069.08
could probably do that presuming that it

2063.32 --> 2072.3790000000004
does work like that I'm just wondering

2069.08 --> 2074.75
like engineering the the effect of the

2072.379 --> 2078.5899999999997
Sun and the Sun is obviously a natural

2074.75 --> 2080.419
effect of Bridals the energy is around

2078.59 --> 2082.8790000000004
but yeah if you can simulate that in

2080.419 --> 2087.94
smaller scale yeah you could potentially

2082.879 --> 2087.94
create an artificial Sun in a region

2088.81 --> 2095.45
maybe it is routed in the HAARP type

2092.33 --> 2097.73
technology like a constant wave of

2095.45 --> 2100.95
energy

2097.73 --> 2103.56
crossing over I'm now like wildly

2100.95 --> 2105.39
speculating science fiction but what

2103.56 --> 2108.87
yeah they could create a crossover point

2105.39 --> 2111.72
in a location and then a Sun an extra

2108.87 --> 2113.97
source of daylight would appear there in

2111.72 --> 2115.89
the cross section maybe it could work

2113.97 --> 2119.04
like that I don't know what they what

2115.89 --> 2125.43
they've been figuring out with all that

2119.04 --> 2127.47
technology you know you can you can

2125.43 --> 2132.3599999999997
follow you can find that a lot of you

2127.47 --> 2138.1499999999996
can find a lot of patents that were in

2132.36 --> 2142.4100000000003
the 50s and the 60s so now sometimes I

2138.15 --> 2146.1800000000003
think to myself now maybe maybe they

2142.41 --> 2150.08
created a son to perform tests on

2146.18 --> 2152.3399999999997
materials that they'll make instead of

2150.08 --> 2154.83
instead of painting something and

2152.34 --> 2157.9100000000003
letting it sit on the Sun for years to

2154.83 --> 2160.98
do a test they can do something indoors

2157.91 --> 2164.19
with a Sun simulator to speed up the

2160.98 --> 2169.98
time of what light would do to the

2164.19 --> 2173.67
material speed up at that time okay so

2169.98 --> 2177.9
so basically let's say I miss an

2173.67 --> 2181.9500000000003
aberration well okay right I'm using it

2177.9 --> 2184.94
as so basically so let's say you built a

2181.95 --> 2187.7
car and you painted it some type of

2184.94 --> 2192.93
chameleon candy paint or something right

2187.7 --> 2195.54
and you wanted to see you wanted to see

2192.93 --> 2197.7599999999998
the effects of that paint after it's sat

2195.54 --> 2201.21
out in the Sun for years and years and

2197.76 --> 2205.94
years right right so that's instead of

2201.21 --> 2210.03
easy you just simulate you take a lamp

2205.94 --> 2214.23
that has the same type of light spectrum

2210.03 --> 2217.4700000000003
and you make it a lot stronger or you or

2214.23 --> 2220.02
you lens it like through looking-glass

2217.47 --> 2222.93
we're also concentrated something are

2220.02 --> 2225.98
you mirror it with a dish but yeah

2222.93 --> 2229.72
that's not that hard to do

2225.98 --> 2233.58
and just up the intensity of the

2229.72 --> 2236.83
lecture right the correct spectrum just

2233.58 --> 2240.79
to see the effects of what that like

2236.83 --> 2242.71
that does to material even so sometimes

2240.79 --> 2246.0099999999998
I think maybe that's what they're using

2242.71 --> 2254.23
it for makes sense

2246.01 --> 2256.119
kinda yeah you know but well I guess

2254.23 --> 2260.89
it's kind of hard to ask you because you

2256.119 --> 2262.9300000000003
you seem like you haven't really looked

2260.89 --> 2264.19
into it a little bit cuz you didn't

2262.93 --> 2264.7799999999997
really sound like you were familiar with

2264.19 --> 2267.52
it

2264.78 --> 2271.57
the artificial shown yeah I've heard

2267.52 --> 2274.59
about that right well I mean I'm not no

2271.57 --> 2277.15
professional or nothing but I mean I I

2274.59 --> 2282.58
can read patents you know what I mean

2277.15 --> 2285.58
and you know and uh if they're patenting

2282.58 --> 2290.41
something like that then apparently

2285.58 --> 2293.29
their technology exists would that would

2290.41 --> 2295.7799999999997
that be correct for me to say well or

2293.29 --> 2298.81
they just figuring it out that it is

2295.78 --> 2303.13
possible it's not necessary that they

2298.81 --> 2305.41
actually tested it it's like jumping to

2303.13 --> 2307.869
the patent before anyone could figure

2305.41 --> 2310.1189999999997
out something similar as it were right

2307.869 --> 2313.119
it could still be in the testing phases

2310.119 --> 2315.19
or just let it wait for later and it's

2313.119 --> 2316.839
just like to make sure nobody else

2315.19 --> 2323.26
starts to do anything like that

2316.839 --> 2324.75
Oh kinda needs to get patents right yeah

2323.26 --> 2328.2400000000002
that makes sense

2324.75 --> 2331.57
but yeah hey I I wouldn't be surprised

2328.24 --> 2333.16
the least if it's possible especially if

2331.57 --> 2336.67
you realize that the Sun is not a giant

2333.16 --> 2341.68
ball of fire it's not that complicated

2336.67 --> 2344.08
if you can just back engineer the effect

2341.68 --> 2347.3199999999997
of the daylight if you know what causes

2344.08 --> 2352.2
it you can simulate it yeah you got a

2347.32 --> 2352.2000000000003
technology based on nature

2356.15 --> 2362.54
oh yeah anyway I don't I don't want to

2360.68 --> 2366.1
get too deep into it I just I just

2362.54 --> 2369.2
wanted to ask your opinion because I I

2366.1 --> 2372.2599999999998
when I was like when I was a child I I

2369.2 --> 2375.16
was I love to be outside a lot that's

2372.26 --> 2378.59
all I wanted to do was be outside and I

2375.16 --> 2382.0699999999997
don't ever remember the Sun you know

2378.59 --> 2383.96
burning my skin like it does now now I

2382.07 --> 2386.51
find myself trying to get in the shade

2383.96 --> 2390.7400000000002
because sometimes it's Sun hurts you

2386.51 --> 2393.2200000000003
know when it's even even at ten o'clock

2390.74 --> 2395.8399999999997
eleven o'clock in the day it's like wow

2393.22 --> 2398.8999999999996
okay well that can have something to do

2395.84 --> 2400.73
with your metabolism really true yeah

2398.9 --> 2403.64
somebody else told me that too I don't

2400.73 --> 2406.7
have that at all broker at all I can

2403.64 --> 2408.17
take anything - um you'reyou're actually

2406.7 --> 2410.6899999999996
the second person that's told me that

2408.17 --> 2412.91
right and if there's a double with Sun

2410.69 --> 2417.83
just don't take sunscreen just use other

2412.91 --> 2419.81
way veering right you know it that just

2417.83 --> 2423.14
the plant just get one of those organic

2419.81 --> 2425.0
leaves and if you cut it open there's

2423.14 --> 2426.71
like this weird gel in it and you can

2425.0 --> 2429.02
just yeah you can eat it it's absolutely

2426.71 --> 2432.02
disgusting and don't recommend it but it

2429.02 --> 2434.99
is healthy or you can just like get this

2432.02 --> 2440.45
fish out and just rub it all over your

2434.99 --> 2442.7599999999998
skin yeah that works really well it's

2440.45 --> 2446.66
good for your skin is healthy helps you

2442.76 --> 2450.6200000000003
regenerate as well so yeah by the way

2446.66 --> 2456.68
Farrah and make sure you get plenty of

2450.62 --> 2462.41
vitamin C also important hydration of

2456.68 --> 2464.29
course yeah you think about our overall

2462.41 --> 2467.1499999999996
we think about to stay with water

2464.29 --> 2470.08
distilled water well it's better than

2467.15 --> 2474.05
fluoridated water and can tell you that

2470.08 --> 2477.11
but I personally would recommend ceramic

2474.05 --> 2482.36
filtered water instead it's what I've

2477.11 --> 2485.1200000000003
been using for 10 years or more and it's

2482.36 --> 2487.2200000000003
basically there's carbon filters very

2485.12 --> 2489.71
common those are very good but they

2487.22 --> 2493.0099999999998
degenerate in quality very quickly

2489.71 --> 2494.93
ramit filters don't do that and what

2493.01 --> 2497.75
they do is they filter pretty much

2494.93 --> 2501.589
everything toxic out and leave the good

2497.75 --> 2502.58
minerals in that's it really does that

2501.589 --> 2508.19
it's amazing

2502.58 --> 2511.22
and it's yeah that is the best because

2508.19 --> 2514.369
then you don't have to add extra

2511.22 --> 2518.27
minerals to your diet because you do

2514.369 --> 2522.67
need to do that when you take what is it

2518.27 --> 2522.67
distilled water still water here

2523.78 --> 2529.849
although I guess for cats it might

2526.94 --> 2535.339
actually be beneficial because that's

2529.849 --> 2539.17
tend to not respond well to mineral so

2535.339 --> 2539.17
they might actually benefit from it

2539.41 --> 2552.3489999999997
cats tripped me out there there's sneaky

2543.26 --> 2554.9900000000002
little yeah man I just never been on the

2552.349 --> 2556.55
show I'm honestly I'm I've never sat and

2554.99 --> 2558.7099999999996
had a one-on-one with you man

2556.55 --> 2561.7400000000002
I've been on the panel with you a bunch

2558.71 --> 2566.7200000000003
but yeah it's good talk yeah I like it

2561.74 --> 2569.359
come back yeah yeah I like I like you

2566.72 --> 2576.1899999999996
have a different way of looking at

2569.359 --> 2576.19
things and at first it can seem kind of

2578.05 --> 2584.98
trying to be nice here no BS blatantly

2582.2 --> 2588.64
honest as you can please

2584.98 --> 2592.2400000000002
so at first I used to think that you

2588.64 --> 2595.2799999999997
wouldn't ever allow any criticism oh

2592.24 --> 2599.089
right right yeah and I've gotten that

2595.28 --> 2605.42
was that was one thing yeah that was one

2599.089 --> 2607.49
thing that I something I didn't like

2605.42 --> 2609.32
about you I just I thought that I

2607.49 --> 2612.3799999999997
thought that that was one of your

2609.32 --> 2617.0
downfalls is there it was but I got

2612.38 --> 2619.58
better I knew it was a problem it's yeah

2617.0 --> 2621.02
I'm a sensitive guy and that's just the

2619.58 --> 2624.619
thing and

2621.02 --> 2626.57
now I don't I don't have that response

2624.619 --> 2631.58
as strongly only with the worst of the

2626.57 --> 2634.52
worst people because I think it really

2631.58 --> 2638.23
depends on how how a person is brought

2634.52 --> 2638.23
up on what they think

2638.53 --> 2649.1000000000004
well I actively avoid negative behavior

2645.71 --> 2653.48
it's I could say yeah a person a

2649.1 --> 2658.85
personal religious thing it's just part

2653.48 --> 2661.79
of walking the path and I have expressed

2658.85 --> 2663.68
a lot of darkness in my life a lot of

2661.79 --> 2665.7799999999997
impulses from the inside especially when

2663.68 --> 2668.45
I was really young because my feelings

2665.78 --> 2673.369
are just so strong and they go strong in

2668.45 --> 2676.52
either way but now I just know what that

2673.369 --> 2678.29
does it's there's just nothing positive

2676.52 --> 2679.58
you can get out of that on the long run

2678.29 --> 2682.58
even though it might seem like a

2679.58 --> 2686.69
short-term solution in some situations

2682.58 --> 2690.98
and I just I try to stay aware of what I

2686.69 --> 2692.69
do and just really like always immediate

2690.98 --> 2696.56
and see it from the other people's

2692.69 --> 2699.7400000000002
perspective so even when I was like very

2696.56 --> 2703.25
ego sensitive in the in the start when I

2699.74 --> 2705.35
started to appear on YouTube I knew

2703.25 --> 2707.99
every time that I when I was responding

2705.35 --> 2711.23
like to somebody like it'll shut up or

2707.99 --> 2714.89
sensory that I knew that everybody was

2711.23 --> 2716.33
aware and that it is stupid of me I was

2714.89 --> 2717.98
aware of that but I just couldn't deal

2716.33 --> 2719.72
with it any other way at the time and

2717.98 --> 2722.119
now I've just learned to like okay it

2719.72 --> 2729.0699999999997
hurts okay

2722.119 --> 2729.07
and stop doing that took some time yeah

2729.609 --> 2735.44
yeah you you have you have changed a

2732.95 --> 2743.02
little bit I watched some of the old

2735.44 --> 2743.02
shows and I was pretty wild yeah I know

2743.29 --> 2751.46
but yeah man I you know just wanted to

2748.52 --> 2752.9
come on the earlybird never been on it

2751.46 --> 2756.4700000000003
before so

2752.9 --> 2759.4700000000003
and just just to kind of talk to you man

2756.47 --> 2762.319
it's cooler it's cool to kind of talk to

2759.47 --> 2767.859
somebody that's it has a totally

2762.319 --> 2771.859
different way of thinking you know right

2767.859 --> 2774.2889999999998
and it's not a bad thing you know I I

2771.859 --> 2778.779
should never see it as a bad thing but

2774.289 --> 2782.6800000000003
her broad I mean is it really yeah well

2778.779 --> 2785.539
it's not really too different I just I

2782.68 --> 2788.6299999999997
think that other people do also think

2785.539 --> 2792.7400000000002
this but they seldom get themselves to

2788.63 --> 2798.619
actually apply it right that's the issue

2792.74 --> 2803.66
right that's a cultural issue too many

2798.619 --> 2805.279
options right yeah

2803.66 --> 2809.48
anyway yeah we got 10 minutes left on

2805.279 --> 2811.96

2862.519 --> 2866.3289999999997
really good for a photograph as well but

2864.38 --> 2872.839
if I move around with it then just get

2866.329 --> 2875.69
so fluffy and wacky I understand I

2872.839 --> 2877.569
understand I I couldn't pull off long

2875.69 --> 2886.66
hair I wouldn't look right

2877.569 --> 2890.47
I've had long hair 26 years Wow

2890.47 --> 2897.74

2897.74 --> 2902.45
three how do you accomplish that that's

2900.44 --> 2905.6
true that's true you just said that's

2902.45 --> 2911.24
true thank you no I'm actually 38

2905.6 --> 2916.85
yeah 38 Wow I'm uh I'm 31

2911.24 --> 2922.5099999999998

2916.85 --> 2928.21
people oh man it was good talking to you

2922.51 --> 2930.3500000000004
if you if you ever get time man

2928.21 --> 2932.42
there's there's a couple of channels out

2930.35 --> 2934.7
there that's that's all they do is film

2932.42 --> 2936.19
the song man and they found some crazy

2934.7 --> 2938.54
stuff all right

2936.19 --> 2941.75
and I don't know what to think about it

2938.54 --> 2943.91
you know well you mean like the the

2941.75 --> 2948.05
weird phenomena like the blinking Sun

2943.91 --> 2951.47
and the angel shaped some that kind of

2948.05 --> 2958.19
thing I've seen those videos stuff stuff

2951.47 --> 2962.68
like sorry stuff like that and there's

2958.19 --> 2964.76
there's some other stuff you know and I

2962.68 --> 2967.52
just don't know what the thing about it

2964.76 --> 2973.3700000000003
I don't know because it's people messing

2967.52 --> 2975.35
with the yeah just I think that's

2973.37 --> 2977.7799999999997
artificially induced I don't know who's

2975.35 --> 2979.73
inducing it right don't know Nessa if

2977.78 --> 2984.71
it's necessarily humans maybe it maybe

2979.73 --> 2990.26
extra-dimensional managers maybe it is

2984.71 --> 2992.33
the angels you know or somebody darker I

2990.26 --> 2995.5400000000004
hope not well maybe there really is no

2992.33 --> 2997.93
difference I don't know I hope there's a

2995.54 --> 2997.93
difference

3001.22 --> 3006.2
well I might have a good have a good day

3004.55 --> 3011.03
man I'm gonna let you round out your

3006.2 --> 3014.3289999999997
show and I'll probably see you over an

3011.03 --> 3017.8100000000004
eighth of the back yeah I will pop a

3014.329 --> 3022.6090000000004
body right after the show ends sorry

3017.81 --> 3023.54
thanks for coming yeah man all right man

3022.609 --> 3030.47
take it easy

3023.54 --> 3034.849
see you later so yeah thanks everyone

3030.47 --> 3039.02
for coming it's been interesting lots of

3034.849 --> 3041.63
activity in chat I didn't even yeah so

3039.02 --> 3045.47
occupying if this conversation I could

3041.63 --> 3047.839
barely get into it as for the statement

3045.47 --> 3049.81
about the the ones actually having

3047.839 --> 3052.4
controls over the dials of the world

3049.81 --> 3056.2999999999997
whether they be good or evil I think

3052.4 --> 3059.75
that whatever entities they are they

3056.3 --> 3062.92
have been tasked very specifically and

3059.75 --> 3065.93
they probably I'm not going to be as

3062.92 --> 3069.4700000000003
degenerate as some of the human

3065.93 --> 3070.97
controllers can get so I don't think we

3069.47 --> 3072.3799999999997
have to worry about that too much

3070.97 --> 3075.47
they're probably just following some

3072.38 --> 3077.7200000000003
cosmic plan or whatever when that kind

3075.47 --> 3081.8289999999997
of thing happens maybe it is literally

3077.72 --> 3085.1299999999997
the creator's come on no prophecy I

3081.829 --> 3087.1090000000004
don't know it's a giant mystery all

3085.13 --> 3092.63
these weird some phenomena those

3087.109 --> 3097.16
especially but anyway for now I'm gonna

3092.63 --> 3099.23
run out the show and get on debates

3097.16 --> 3101.0
right after this so yeah if you haven't

3099.23 --> 3103.819
subscribed to my channel already please

3101.0 --> 3106.069
do so and if check if you're still

3103.819 --> 3108.5

3108.5 --> 3112.579
reason
