yeah i did definitely hear that

223.68 --> 227.08
good for you

238.4 --> 241.84
i thought it was from qe

243.12 --> 247.08

oh from sleeping warrior oh wait yeah

258.639 --> 263.12

sleeping warrior

264.72 --> 268.199
terry 3006.

270.639 --> 276.8
do panel members read the chat yes

274.08 --> 276.8
yes they do

279.36 --> 284.47900000000004
i mean not all of them constantly i mean

282.16 --> 288.32000000000005
just like me sometimes they're busy just

284.479 --> 288.32
doing other things or working

289.919 --> 294.479
like chocolate and elijah are usually

292.72 --> 296.32000000000005
working

294.479 --> 298.24
so they don't really have time to read

296.32 --> 300.0
the chat unless somebody specifically

298.24 --> 302.88
brings the attention to that and then

300.0 --> 302.88
they might take a peek

306.88 --> 311.71999999999997
cool water

308.72 --> 311.72
brilliant

312.4 --> 316.71999999999997
yeah i also got hot water and green tea

314.72 --> 318.96000000000004
don't know if that was a brilliant idea

316.72 --> 318.96000000000004
but

319.36 --> 324.24
i made it anyway

320.88 --> 324.24
oh and i got a bonus

329.44 --> 334.0
definitely eat later on in the show or

331.6 --> 334.0
after

335.039 --> 338.039
um

357.28 --> 366.11999999999995
tyler durden what is this okay

361.84 --> 366.11999999999995
right yeah no it's right

367.039 --> 373.199
i don't hear you getting shouted out

369.44 --> 373.199
very often either but then again

377.6 --> 383.68
you don't really like have

380.56 --> 385.6
flat earth videos or anything so

383.68 --> 389.8
it's pretty remarkable to get a shout

385.6 --> 389.8
out just from chat activities

404.72 --> 409.84000000000003
right

406.56 --> 412.16
so when am i going to talk about

409.84 --> 413.919
i still feel great like yesterday

412.16 --> 416.0
although yeah the

413.919 --> 419.19899999999996
yesterday you got to realize it like i

416.0 --> 421.199
just got a fresh dose of like recovery

419.199 --> 422.72
through my healer right before the show

421.199 --> 423.91900000000004
like literally

422.72 --> 427.59900000000005
hang up

423.919 --> 430.15999999999997
click start the show so

427.599 --> 431.52
yeah it's a little less now it always

430.16 --> 434.56
happens but

431.52 --> 434.56
still i feel great

435.52 --> 440.96
was watching some

438.4 --> 440.96
videos

441.52 --> 444.96
on uh

442.96 --> 446.479
revoice

444.96 --> 448.79999999999995
dot io

446.479 --> 452.4
matt quantum of consciousness site harry

448.8 --> 455.28000000000003
machowski had a video there i watched it

452.4 --> 456.88
about basically the

455.28 --> 458.96
yeah his

456.88 --> 460.8
vision of ascension

458.96 --> 463.52
like the uh

460.8 --> 464.8
the qatarian way

463.52 --> 466.87899999999996
you could say

464.8 --> 468.72
don't know if he calls it that still

466.879 --> 470.319
but it is very interesting and and

468.72 --> 472.16
puzzling

470.319 --> 474.319
like i find it i find it kind of tough

472.16 --> 477.319
sometimes to like hear him out on that

474.319 --> 477.319
because

478.0 --> 484.56
it just kind of to me seems to reveal

481.599 --> 486.639
another reverse world fractal

484.56 --> 488.8
but in the sense that

486.639 --> 492.08
he might be right

488.8 --> 495.759
and my vantage point might be wrong but

492.08 --> 495.75899999999996
i'm not entirely sure yet

496.16 --> 500.56
then again i've always had

498.479 --> 504.599
this weird love

500.56 --> 504.599
and hope for the earthly

506.24 --> 511.68
he does not seem to share that sentiment

509.199 --> 511.68
as much

515.519 --> 520.68
hey

517.279 --> 520.68
see hello

520.719 --> 523.6800000000001
aaron armstrong

525.36 --> 530.399
the katara grid

528.56 --> 534.2399999999999
that word does not

530.399 --> 536.399
bring any bells terror 306.

534.24 --> 540.16
what do you think about infighting

536.399 --> 540.16
amongst flat earthers well

541.6 --> 545.839
what's there to think about i mean yeah

543.76 --> 547.12
that happened started happening a long

545.839 --> 549.2790000000001
time ago

547.12 --> 553.04
at the start pretty much

549.279 --> 554.48
say 2016 is when i really hit off

553.04 --> 558.0
i'd say

554.48 --> 560.8000000000001
the infighting has become a lot better

558.0 --> 563.36
yeah i said it it's become a lot better

560.8 --> 564.4799999999999
why how

563.36 --> 567.04
because

564.48 --> 570.399
there's less paranoia

567.04 --> 572.16
driving the infighting as it used to

570.399 --> 573.36
remember everybody calling each other a

572.16 --> 576.399
chill

573.36 --> 578.88
oh my camera's gonna freeze

576.399 --> 578.88
what the

579.6 --> 583.9200000000001
like is that seriously

582.24 --> 585.279
what is that

583.92 --> 587.04
that's not just

585.279 --> 591.8389999999999
wired

587.04 --> 591.8389999999999
disconnection what the hell man

592.8 --> 595.1999999999999
weird

596.0 --> 601.519
but yeah less paranoia

599.12 --> 602.399
the the uh flat earth in fighting these

601.519 --> 605.279
days

602.399 --> 606.16
it is now more about like tribalism

605.279 --> 608.56
though

606.16 --> 609.76
it's become less paranoia more tribal

608.56 --> 612.2399999999999
natured

609.76 --> 614.48
so like our group

612.24 --> 616.64
that sort of thing but that's really

614.48 --> 619.839
just natural behavior

616.64 --> 622.48
that's what humans typically do

619.839 --> 625.0400000000001
so the infighting is not technically all

622.48 --> 625.04
that bad

627.6 --> 633.839
but also i think that a lot of the

630.48 --> 635.6800000000001
alleged infighting is simply just a

633.839 --> 639.0400000000001
bunch of conflicts

635.68 --> 641.76
philosophical conflicts ego conflicts

639.04 --> 644.16
that are then taken note off by the

641.76 --> 645.12
anti-flat earth community

644.16 --> 648.24
and

645.12 --> 651.6
potentially by algorithms troll

648.24 --> 652.5600000000001
algorithms that then amplify

651.6 --> 656.0
it

652.56 --> 656.0
to make it seem worse

662.48 --> 665.519
so

663.519 --> 668.0
i hope that answers your question aaron

665.519 --> 668.0
armstrong

668.959 --> 672.2399999999999
there's a change in the way flat

670.72 --> 674.0
earthers in fight

672.24 --> 676.8
now there's less paranoia and there's

674.0 --> 678.0
more tribalization formation

676.8 --> 678.88
and

678.0 --> 681.36
well

678.88 --> 685.88
we'll see where it's going to evolve to

681.36 --> 685.88
spiritually evolve to next

691.92 --> 695.12
bob noodles

694.0 --> 698.56
what

695.12 --> 700.88
accepted the apology from nathan okay

698.56 --> 703.68
dude nathan's been apologizing a whole

700.88 --> 705.36
bunch to bob supposedly and every time

703.68 --> 708.079
i'm like why

705.36 --> 710.88
i mean that's like

708.079 --> 710.88
i don't get it

714.639 --> 719.279
and what what are you talking about even

717.2 --> 721.0400000000001
terror 306 seems like you're just saying

719.279 --> 724.24
that i didn't pick up on anything like

721.04 --> 725.04
that he apologized to whitsid

724.24 --> 727.519
for

725.04 --> 729.4399999999999
the level of his

727.519 --> 731.44
social behavior

729.44 --> 732.9590000000001
the intensity of it because it was

731.44 --> 735.12
justified

732.959 --> 737.4399999999999
but it was

735.12 --> 740.48
perceived as slightly disrespectful by

737.44 --> 740.48
nathan personally

742.8 --> 746.959
and i disagreed with him on it

745.519 --> 749.2
publicly

746.959 --> 749.1999999999999
so

753.12 --> 757.6
i think it has to do with string person

755.44 --> 760.0790000000001
what does that mean string print oh

757.6 --> 761.36
strong personality right alpha behavior

760.079 --> 763.5999999999999
yeah

761.36 --> 765.279
it is

763.6 --> 768.279
social behavior

765.279 --> 768.279
correct

773.36 --> 775.6800000000001
what

777.04 --> 780.959
okay

778.079 --> 782.6389999999999
turret you mean that show yesterday

780.959 --> 785.04
because i did watch

782.639 --> 787.44
a chunk of that kept me up very late by

785.04 --> 789.12
the way

787.44 --> 790.8000000000001
but i did watch a chunk of that he had

789.12 --> 794.16
that weird

790.8 --> 796.399
australian alley b character sorry that

794.16 --> 798.399
it's just immediately reminded me of ali

796.399 --> 801.44
b the way he looked

798.399 --> 804.56
and the way he talked like that was an

801.44 --> 806.8000000000001
australian alibi i was almost gonna ask

804.56 --> 809.3599999999999
what yeah i did abandon

806.8 --> 812.079
jaron's chat so i'm just gonna ask

809.36 --> 815.04
did alan just go undercover and let just

812.079 --> 817.68
pop back up as an australian

815.04 --> 817.68
flat earther

824.079 --> 829.76
he did have some interesting things to

826.0 --> 833.68
say it was one thing that was kind of

829.76 --> 833.68
a bit of a curiosity on my part

838.88 --> 843.6
it was weird

840.88 --> 844.56
that guy on jiren yesterday yesterday

843.6 --> 847.839
evening

844.56 --> 847.8389999999999
to him night to me

850.88 --> 855.68
okay and he's part of santos channels

853.04 --> 859.68
okay i didn't know that

855.68 --> 859.68
i don't watch santos at all

861.12 --> 864.72
right

862.399 --> 865.76
yeah i'm not hyper enthusiastic about

864.72 --> 869.44
the guy

865.76 --> 873.199
but he had he's a bit of a

869.44 --> 875.839
scatterbrain naturally like alibi that's

873.199 --> 879.12
why he also reminds me of him

875.839 --> 881.12
but he that has seemed to like grab a

879.12 --> 882.32
whole bunch of information from all

881.12 --> 884.9590000000001
sides

882.32 --> 887.36
it's just kind of messy

884.959 --> 888.8
but it is interesting he has sourced you

887.36 --> 889.76
could hear it by what he was talking

888.8 --> 892.959
about

889.76 --> 894.399
it's just a bit messy

892.959 --> 896.88
but

894.399 --> 899.12
he mentioned one thing

896.88 --> 901.76
that was interesting to me

899.12 --> 904.24
and i wonder like he said basically that

901.76 --> 905.92
he had back engineered

904.24 --> 908.24
maps

905.92 --> 910.639
uh was it the gleason's map

908.24 --> 912.8
where and he was talking about how

910.639 --> 916.0
supposedly and i wonder if this is true

912.8 --> 918.399
i don't think so but it might be

916.0 --> 921.36
might be a mistake on his part

918.399 --> 923.44
that the rectangular map was originally

921.36 --> 925.12
somehow derived

923.44 --> 926.5600000000001
from a disk

925.12 --> 928.72
and i'm like

926.56 --> 929.68
what

928.72 --> 932.24
what

929.68 --> 935.12
what the hell are you talking about

932.24 --> 936.88
and then he like rolled on into like oh

935.12 --> 938.48
this is the globe

936.88 --> 941.12
we're fighting the globe through that

938.48 --> 943.36
but i'm just like

941.12 --> 945.6
what the hell is he talking about i've

943.36 --> 947.519
never heard anybody even claim something

945.6 --> 949.519
like that

947.519 --> 954.36
weird

949.519 --> 954.36
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

963.519 --> 967.639
what are you talking about see

998.72 --> 1004.399
or just say nothing just have something

1001.279 --> 1006.56
really weird in the chat as a question

1004.399 --> 1007.759
and then when i inquire to explain

1006.56 --> 1010.2399999999999
further

1007.759 --> 1011.54
just don't say anything see you could do

1010.24 --> 1016.2
that too great

1011.54 --> 1016.1999999999999
[Music]

1019.839 --> 1025.3600000000001
just the esoteric stuff that is what the

1023.04 --> 1027.36
[ __ ] are you talking about the esoteric

1025.36 --> 1030.1599999999999
stuff are you criticizing me do you know

1027.36 --> 1031.039
how much [ __ ] esoteric [ __ ] i talk

1030.16 --> 1034.0790000000002
about

1031.039 --> 1034.079
spirit mechanics

1034.64 --> 1037.88
all that

1038.64 --> 1041.8390000000002
you have a problem with that

1051.6 --> 1054.32
i mean it all depends on what you're

1053.28 --> 1057.76
gonna do

1054.32 --> 1058.96
with all that esoteric stuff right what

1057.76 --> 1061.039
are you gonna do with it are you guys

1058.96 --> 1062.799
gonna be like some like everything is

1061.039 --> 1065.36
fake tour

1062.799 --> 1067.44
gonna like sow paranoia over secret

1065.36 --> 1068.24
hidden meanings and paintings and [ __ ]

1067.44 --> 1069.76
or

1068.24 --> 1071.28
like it all depends on what you're going

1069.76 --> 1073.12
to do what are you going to focus on are

1071.28 --> 1074.96
you going to focus on

1073.12 --> 1076.08
evil being hidden

1074.96 --> 1078.48
within

1076.08 --> 1081.36
daily things

1078.48 --> 1083.919
right so it all depends on the well in

1081.36 --> 1086.559
this case flat earther and like

1083.919 --> 1088.48
what they want to talk about

1086.559 --> 1091.039
what they get excited over that's

1088.48 --> 1092.88
usually what they talk about esoteric

1091.039 --> 1096.48
wise right for some people it was

1092.88 --> 1099.5200000000002
transvestite oh god so

1096.48 --> 1102.88
so interesting yeah no not to me that's

1099.52 --> 1104.2
gross and kind of gay

1102.88 --> 1107.1200000000001
so

1104.2 --> 1110.48
[Music]

1107.12 --> 1113.4399999999998
right flat earth is yeah you can't just

1110.48 --> 1116.24
only talk about flutter like even nathan

1113.44 --> 1119.1200000000001
frickin oakley can't only talk about

1116.24 --> 1119.1200000000001
flutter this just

1119.36 --> 1123.6
you're going to talk about other things

1121.039 --> 1127.6
so what are you going to talk about

1123.6 --> 1127.6
i like to talk about spirit mechanics

1132.799 --> 1137.52
nathan likes to talk about

1135.2 --> 1140.0800000000002
cars and

1137.52 --> 1142.32
sound equipment

1140.08 --> 1142.32
right

1148.64 --> 1154.0800000000002
and we all like to talk about psychology

1151.039 --> 1156.08
i mean have you even realized that among

1154.08 --> 1158.72
flat earth

1156.08 --> 1161.36
psychology is kind of a mandatory course

1158.72 --> 1163.44
now like it you're going to learn it

1161.36 --> 1164.4799999999998
like you don't have to like oh i have to

1163.44 --> 1166.96
read

1164.48 --> 1168.64
the book of psychology no you're just

1166.96 --> 1170.24
going to learn or you're going to be

1168.64 --> 1172.24
like ah

1170.24 --> 1173.679
i don't want to have anything to do with

1172.24 --> 1176.32
this anymore

1173.679 --> 1178.24
so either you learn psychology

1176.32 --> 1179.9189999999999
or you get the hell out that's pretty

1178.24 --> 1181.84
much what has become because we are

1179.919 --> 1183.76
dealing with

1181.84 --> 1186.9189999999999
crazy people

1183.76 --> 1186.919
a lot

1196.48 --> 1201.88
nathan sub count stuck what are you

1198.559 --> 1201.8799999999999
talking about

1222.96 --> 1227.3600000000001
you're new to the channel well i saw you

1224.88 --> 1230.0
here yesterday

1227.36 --> 1233.52
wait so you literally haven't watched

1230.0 --> 1236.88
anything and you just go in the chat

1233.52 --> 1236.8799999999999
is that what you do see

1237.76 --> 1241.84
that's a very weird habit

1240.24 --> 1246.6
especially if you're going to join the

1241.84 --> 1246.6
show called flat earth early bird

1248.32 --> 1255.6
i mean you might wanna like watch

1251.679 --> 1255.6000000000001
maybe a show or like

1256.0 --> 1259.24
a little

1263.2 --> 1268.159
watch the load of fvd okay well then you

1265.919 --> 1268.159
know

1270.0 --> 1272.88
then you should know

1274.32 --> 1281.76
i mean i talk a lot of uh psychology

1278.64 --> 1284.64
somewhat bordering spirit mechanics

1281.76 --> 1284.64
on fvd2

1287.76 --> 1292.24
trying to find my chat yeah great and

1290.4 --> 1293.2800000000002
thanks for nathan for keep shouting me

1292.24 --> 1296.48
out

1293.28 --> 1296.48
i really appreciate that

1301.6 --> 1307.6399999999999
saw dave murphy no upload no i have not

1344.159 --> 1349.0390000000002
east of nancy yeah now that's

1346.559 --> 1351.28
that's nathan just kind of poo pooing on

1349.039 --> 1351.28
my

1351.919 --> 1358.0
rather

1353.0 --> 1361.52
extravagance yeah extravagant ideas

1358.0 --> 1364.559
that are yeah are not exactly scientific

1361.52 --> 1366.8799999999999
although yeah at least i don't go on

1364.559 --> 1368.1589999999999
some kind of an ether right loop or

1366.88 --> 1371.8400000000001
something

1368.159 --> 1375.8400000000001
so i'm not writing aberrations here

1371.84 --> 1377.6789999999999
i identify and then cast off aberrations

1375.84 --> 1380.24
as i come across them as i did with

1377.679 --> 1382.96
gravity and ether

1380.24 --> 1385.679
but yeah looping confine is not an

1382.96 --> 1387.44
aberration and celestial non-local

1385.679 --> 1391.039
holograms

1387.44 --> 1391.039
are not an aberration either

1391.12 --> 1395.28
they're very perceivable

1393.039 --> 1398.32
and if there is measurable

1395.28 --> 1401.12
things and testable things

1398.32 --> 1402.8799999999999
in order to figure out

1401.12 --> 1408.0
how much

1402.88 --> 1408.0
i might be correct about my assertions

1408.159 --> 1414.5200000000002
and i've explained those tests

1410.88 --> 1414.5200000000002
that could be done

1414.56 --> 1417.81
[Music]

1423.279 --> 1427.48
the hell are you talking about george

1436.4 --> 1440.52
[ __ ] then

1447.52 --> 1452.559
so what are you going to do about it dan

1450.08 --> 1455.039
what are you going to do about it

1452.559 --> 1457.44
going to get a third party involved to

1455.039 --> 1459.039
isolate that because

1457.44 --> 1461.76
the current

1459.039 --> 1464.799
non-russian governments pretty much

1461.76 --> 1467.2
all they ever do now

1464.799 --> 1470.08
is like oh yes we need help and then

1467.2 --> 1470.8400000000001
they basically use it for something else

1470.08 --> 1473.279
to

1470.84 --> 1475.6
weaponize this freaking

1473.279 --> 1477.44
nazi government even more that's what

1475.6 --> 1479.1999999999998
really happened so what are we going to

1477.44 --> 1480.88
do how are you going to secure that

1479.2 --> 1483.679
grain you're going to form a third party

1480.88 --> 1487.4
get in there secure that grain then

1483.679 --> 1487.4
how are you going to do that

1491.81 --> 1494.99
[Music]

1524.48 --> 1531.039
right and hey maybe there are some other

1527.279 --> 1534.159
concerns as well you know oh no grain

1531.039 --> 1537.44
the grain might be destroyed well that's

1534.159 --> 1539.44
storage right how about actual food

1537.44 --> 1543.3200000000002
production

1539.44 --> 1543.3200000000002
as in the producers

1545.12 --> 1547.52
right

1546.0 --> 1549.44
like farmers

1547.52 --> 1551.52
they're being attacked

1549.44 --> 1554.72
politically

1551.52 --> 1554.72
through ridiculous

1554.84 --> 1558.6399999999999
uh

1556.64 --> 1560.7990000000002
i call it again

1558.64 --> 1563.679
nitrogen policy

1560.799 --> 1563.679
it's ridiculous

1564.32 --> 1569.2
right that's actual food produced it

1566.48 --> 1571.919
seemed like yeah a grain style getting

1569.2 --> 1573.52
blown up not nice not good

1571.919 --> 1574.24
worrisome

1573.52 --> 1577.44
but

1574.24 --> 1580.4
like actual food producers that are

1577.44 --> 1582.24
going to produce food

1580.4 --> 1585.8400000000001
seems like that should have a bit of a

1582.24 --> 1585.84
priority in my opinion

1586.72 --> 1591.039
yeah not just the netherlands

1588.799 --> 1592.799
it's not just the netherlands although

1591.039 --> 1593.76
we i like to say our farmers are the

1592.799 --> 1596.48
best

1593.76 --> 1596.48
because they are

1597.44 --> 1601.6000000000001
right

1598.88 --> 1602.96
but like for example canada is getting

1601.6 --> 1603.9189999999999
it now

1602.96 --> 1606.559
like

1603.919 --> 1609.3600000000001
freaking trudeau is suddenly

1606.559 --> 1611.2
trying to copy the stupid nitrogen

1609.36 --> 1613.6789999999999
policy

1611.2 --> 1615.3600000000001
and there's going to be others there

1613.679 --> 1617.6000000000001
going to be other countries that are

1615.36 --> 1620.6399999999999
[ __ ] that are going to try to do that

1617.6 --> 1623.6789999999999
i would not be surprised one bit if

1620.64 --> 1627.48
australia is going to do that [ __ ] too

1623.679 --> 1627.48
can you imagine that

1631.679 --> 1637.44
and probably others

1634.32 --> 1641.2
so yeah green silo getting blown up that

1637.44 --> 1643.6000000000001
really sucks you know but

1641.2 --> 1645.8400000000001
it can be regrown

1643.6 --> 1647.6789999999999
as long as she got farmers that are

1645.84 --> 1650.9189999999999
allowed to do that

1647.679 --> 1650.919
you know

1656.88 --> 1661.0390000000002
okay but you already said you were just

1658.559 --> 1661.039
trolling

1661.6 --> 1665.9189999999999
so

1663.2 --> 1665.919
that's fine

1666.72 --> 1671.039
i like to actually

1668.88 --> 1673.6000000000001
you know respond to those kind of things

1671.039 --> 1676.72
with very serious elaborate answers did

1673.6 --> 1679.039
you not know that did i do that

1676.72 --> 1681.3600000000001
oh i'm gonna say something truly and

1679.039 --> 1684.96
silly oh i'm going to give you

1681.36 --> 1687.039
like the highest level of possible

1684.96 --> 1689.919
response to that

1687.039 --> 1692.1589999999999
as if you actually asked it with in full

1689.919 --> 1694.0
seriousness

1692.159 --> 1696.5590000000002
that's what i do

1694.0 --> 1699.52
you know also why i do that because i

1696.559 --> 1702.1589999999999
have met plenty of intelligent people

1699.52 --> 1704.08
that just cannot

1702.159 --> 1705.5200000000002
have a lot of trouble especially in

1704.08 --> 1708.08
their teens

1705.52 --> 1709.76
to be serious as they're using their

1708.08 --> 1711.76
intelligence

1709.76 --> 1714.399
they like have to be a troll it's like

1711.76 --> 1716.8799999999999
they're scared of their own smarts

1714.399 --> 1718.799
and they would like get trolley and then

1716.88 --> 1721.0390000000002
i would answer them

1718.799 --> 1723.2
fully as i do right here and then they

1721.039 --> 1725.2
would be so thankful

1723.2 --> 1727.8400000000001
that's happened to me

1725.2 --> 1731.1200000000001
so i'm doing it because i know

1727.84 --> 1733.36
that sometimes a troll can actually just

1731.12 --> 1735.039
be a person trying to intelligently

1733.36 --> 1738.0
inquire

1735.039 --> 1741.8799999999999
but is being blocked

1738.0 --> 1741.88
somehow in their frequency

1743.14 --> 1748.47
[Music]

1757.12 --> 1760.1589999999999
yeah you're welcome then

1761.919 --> 1766.3600000000001

professor phil

1825.84 --> 1829.279
that's not a good entry phil

1829.36 --> 1832.559
there's a certain rule

1832.799 --> 1836.279
in my chat

1837.52 --> 1841.52
you might want to just say hello first

1844.559 --> 1849.12
hey bearplegic

1846.72 --> 1851.1200000000001
bear how are you doing

1849.12 --> 1853.84
except for

1851.12 --> 1853.84
really good

1854.72 --> 1859.3600000000001
coffee with turmeric no sorry i don't

1856.64 --> 1862.64
really drink coffee anymore

1859.36 --> 1864.4799999999998
or well to be fair i've had like

1862.64 --> 1867.039
a coffee

1864.48 --> 1867.039
what is it

1867.44 --> 1871.76
three days ago

1869.039 --> 1871.76
in the evening

1872.64 --> 1877.6000000000001
and it was kinda okay but it's like no

1875.6 --> 1879.76
i'm not a coffee drinker anymore like

1877.6 --> 1881.519
that i might have a cup of coffee

1879.76 --> 1883.36
occasionally

1881.519 --> 1886.72
it's just not really something that i

1883.36 --> 1887.84
want to do any anymore every day

1886.72 --> 1890.96
[Music]

1887.84 --> 1892.72
and yes when i do i do still put tumeric

1890.96 --> 1896.519
in it

1892.72 --> 1896.519
because it is the best

1912.96 --> 1918.64
strong yeah i don't need a super strong

1915.6 --> 1921.84
coffee i just like organic

1918.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
like with a

1923.279 --> 1927.6
fruity taste i guess not too excessive

1926.32 --> 1930.24
but just like

1927.6 --> 1932.559
nice full tastes it's just a certain

1930.24 --> 1934.799
type of coffee that i like

1932.559 --> 1936.96
i don't like the hard bitter coffee

1934.799 --> 1939.76
types that are apparently really strong

1936.96 --> 1939.76
i don't like those

1943.6 --> 1947.76
are you a quitter damn it that's just

1945.44 --> 1949.6000000000001
great well paraplegic you know what you

1947.76 --> 1951.919
need to do

1949.6 --> 1953.6789999999999
you need to branch out and get another

1951.919 --> 1954.64
product might be a little bit tougher

1953.679 --> 1956.24
though

1954.64 --> 1959.8400000000001
what you need to do

1956.24 --> 1962.48
is this you need to make gusto

1959.84 --> 1964.72
this is not coffee it's better than

1962.48 --> 1965.84
coffee

1964.72 --> 1967.279
like

1965.84 --> 1970.1589999999999
there's

1967.279 --> 1971.279
every conceivable form of ginseng in

1970.159 --> 1974.159
this

1971.279 --> 1978.0
it's like apple juice based

1974.159 --> 1978.96
it kind of tastes a bit like cola

1978.0 --> 1983.84
but

1978.96 --> 1983.8400000000001
different and it's like really good

the way i always wanted it

2009.679 --> 2014.96
like without being super sugary and

2012.08 --> 2016.8799999999999
without just like having raw caffeine

2014.96 --> 2018.96

paraplegic

2038.0 --> 2042.64
look this up

2040.72 --> 2044.96
this is what you want and yeah you might

2042.64 --> 2046.64
not get an organic label or whatever you

2044.96 --> 2049.2
wouldn't need to you just need to have

2046.64 --> 2049.2000000000003
it right

2049.52 --> 2053.919
and you could get something you could

2051.679 --> 2056.8
make something like that like

2053.919 --> 2059.7999999999997
bear energy drink

2056.8 --> 2059.8
huh

2061.359 --> 2066.159
do the research

2062.879 --> 2066.159
it's going to be so worth it

2066.8 --> 2070.7200000000003
it might even be able to make you walk

2069.119 --> 2074.52
again but

2070.72 --> 2074.52
i can't promise anything

2077.359 --> 2080.399
and

2078.24 --> 2084.1189999999997
i'm of course joking

2080.399 --> 2084.1189999999997
anybody out there

2098.72 --> 2102.9599999999996
sorry you gotta blame the big bear he's

2100.64 --> 2106.8799999999997
always making jokes of you so it's just

2102.96 --> 2106.88
hard to not to try to do that too

2109.04 --> 2111.7599999999998
poor joke

2110.11 --> 2115.56
[Music]

2111.76 --> 2115.5600000000004
oh we got the squirters

2118.8 --> 2123.52
if you specifically would like me not to

2120.88 --> 2127.1600000000003
make those jokes baroplegic bear then

2123.52 --> 2127.16
please tell me

2130.0 --> 2133.2
you know what's funny seeing brendam

2131.599 --> 2134.56
gymbops

2133.2 --> 2136.72
yup

2134.56 --> 2138.48
although seeing is

2136.72 --> 2141.359
not literal of course because she

2138.48 --> 2145.16
doesn't actually he whatever

2141.359 --> 2145.16
doesn't show his face

2162.48 --> 2169.56
club is a gore

2165.28 --> 2169.5600000000004
not trying a g drink what

2181.359 --> 2185.92
all right barry thank you paraplegic

2183.28 --> 2188.7200000000003
bear i almost let that stupid gamma

2185.92 --> 2188.7200000000003
troll get to me

2191.68 --> 2195.7599999999998
i to be fair i think it's pretty epic

2194.079 --> 2196.5600000000004
that you're embracing it all and all

2195.76 --> 2201.119
that

2196.56 --> 2203.52
i think that is actually like epic

2201.119 --> 2206.52
it's really good for morale that you do

2203.52 --> 2206.52
that

2220.56 --> 2224.88
right but yeah definitely check out

2222.72 --> 2227.359
gusto energy drink

2224.88 --> 2228.88
because yeah just coffee you know

2227.359 --> 2231.68
coffee

2228.88 --> 2234.8
some people really live by coffee but

2231.68 --> 2236.56
coffee is actually not all that great

2234.8 --> 2238.7200000000003
it's not good for the body you see if

2236.56 --> 2240.24
you drink a lot of coffee

2238.72 --> 2242.56
so

2240.24 --> 2245.839
you might just want to branch out a

2242.56 --> 2247.359
little like get it to like adjacent but

2245.839 --> 2251.839
become like

2247.359 --> 2251.839
that guy you want you know you want it

2251.92 --> 2256.2400000000002
just like good

2253.44 --> 2258.7200000000003
bear energy drink

2256.24 --> 2258.72
coffee

2259.839 --> 2262.96
and i don't know maybe you could like

2261.76 --> 2264.5600000000004
get

2262.96 --> 2266.96
tea

2264.56 --> 2270.88
how about some green tea or what is it

2266.96 --> 2270.88
again the yamamate tea

2270.96 --> 2274.64
herb teas there's all these kinds of

2272.96 --> 2276.88
different habits out there and i bet

2274.64 --> 2279.5989999999997
that the bear community is all very well

2276.88 --> 2281.52
aware of these different things

2279.599 --> 2282.96
you could totally just

2281.52 --> 2285.839
do that

2282.96 --> 2285.839
if you have the time

2286.079 --> 2289.119
and the inspiration

2292.56 --> 2298.24
i can't believe it took 1300 shows for

2295.359 --> 2298.24
me to catch on

2298.72 --> 2302.56
well i went through a lot of different

2301.119 --> 2305.599
phases

2302.56 --> 2305.599
over the years so

2306.0 --> 2309.44
i mean

2307.119 --> 2310.88
four years ago i was very different i

2309.44 --> 2313.44
was more loose

2310.88 --> 2316.32
but not

2313.44 --> 2318.64
i wasn't as

2316.32 --> 2320.6400000000003
capable

2318.64 --> 2323.92
of dealing with everything

2320.64 --> 2326.96
so i was less interfaced more

2323.92 --> 2329.359
still manifesting myself

2326.96 --> 2331.52
trying to first the ideas

2329.359 --> 2333.2799999999997
right to show like hey wait i can look

2331.52 --> 2335.28
very far

2333.28 --> 2337.2000000000003
to show my skills that's what i used to

2335.28 --> 2339.92
kind of do a lot

2337.2 --> 2342.56
now i'm all just like yeah i i've

2339.92 --> 2344.8
manifested people kind of know what i do

2342.56 --> 2344.7999999999997
now

2345.04 --> 2350.4
so i just gotta tackle more

2348.0 --> 2353.44
put more on my shoulders

2350.4 --> 2355.6800000000003
allow my empathy to be utilized

2353.44 --> 2358.0
more effectively

2355.68 --> 2358.0
anyway

2358.96 --> 2362.96
yeah exactly slow mo moon buggy

2361.2 --> 2367.0
paraplegic is a warrior against victim

2362.96 --> 2367.0
consciousness and it is epic

2372.0 --> 2375.599
this is what

2373.59 --> 2379.119
[Music]

2375.599 --> 2381.839
as long as you stay under 33 cups of

2379.119 --> 2385.6800000000003
helen keller

2381.839 --> 2386.96
pablo esca bear secret stash you owe me

2385.68 --> 2390.64
mine

2386.96 --> 2390.64
is that really what you call it

2391.839 --> 2397.2799999999997
that is so freaking funny dude

2394.72 --> 2401.359
are you are you seriously calling that

2397.28 --> 2401.3590000000004
hell helen keller roast

2403.599 --> 2409.1600000000003
holy [ __ ]

2406.16 --> 2409.16
ugh

2410.16 --> 2414.48
but you gotta be careful not to piss off

2412.16 --> 2416.72
the right people right i mean if you get

2414.48 --> 2418.56
too popular with this they might end up

2416.72 --> 2420.56
breaking your legs

2418.56 --> 2423.88
oh wait

2420.56 --> 2423.88
never mind

2468.24 --> 2470.56
uh

2471.68 --> 2474.68
right

2486.24 --> 2491.04
by the way bearplegic since you're like

2488.4 --> 2495.839
in the bear network and all that

2491.04 --> 2495.839
are there like bare tobacco growers

2529.28 --> 2534.1600000000003
because i mean like i really like bears

2533.04 --> 2536.64
the bear

2534.16 --> 2539.1189999999997
network should really like get into that

2536.64 --> 2541.68
sort of stuff right already got cough

2539.119 --> 2544.319
you gotta go classic

2541.68 --> 2546.7999999999997
really like what was american all that

2544.319 --> 2548.56
famous for right

2546.8 --> 2550.5600000000004
go that way

2548.56 --> 2553.359
now you might want to skip on the sugar

2550.56 --> 2554.88
plantation part because yeah sugar you

2553.359 --> 2556.7999999999997
know why

2554.88 --> 2559.2000000000003
but tobacco

2556.8 --> 2561.44
coffee

2559.2 --> 2561.4399999999996
uh

2561.76 --> 2566.88
of course food all kinds of food but

2564.88 --> 2569.52
like those are the types of products

2566.88 --> 2572.88
that have been like assimilated so long

2569.52 --> 2574.64
ago by the system and industrialized and

2572.88 --> 2577.04
then poisoned

2574.64 --> 2579.5989999999997
it's all been turned to [ __ ]

2577.04 --> 2581.839
so that's the products you really want

2579.599 --> 2585.76
to get back grassroots and you will be

2581.839 --> 2585.7599999999998
mighty popular for even doing it

2586.319 --> 2590.839
kombucha makers yeah yeah awesome

2592.48 --> 2596.8
oh really flatter sage that is so cool

2598.48 --> 2604.28
oh

2599.44 --> 2604.28
you gotta keep me posted about that

2613.68 --> 2616.3999999999996
atf

2619.04 --> 2622.64
yeah but

2621.04 --> 2626.48
what if you

2622.64 --> 2628.319
didn't literally sell it for money

2626.48 --> 2631.04
you could trade it

2628.319 --> 2633.359
atf can get in your business if you do

2631.04 --> 2634.96
that if you just trade it

2633.359 --> 2637.92
and as soon as

2634.96 --> 2640.96
like legal tender is exchanged

2637.92 --> 2643.599
for tobacco that's when they suddenly

2640.96 --> 2644.64
have legal jurisdiction

2643.599 --> 2647.96
sort of

2644.64 --> 2647.96
through the government

2649.52 --> 2655.28
right

2651.04 --> 2657.52
but if you just use it as trade ware

2655.28 --> 2659.3590000000004
that's there's nothing they can do they

2657.52 --> 2660.4
can't even tax you for that

2659.359 --> 2664.0
remember

2660.4 --> 2665.92
bear market just the product bag i got

2664.0 --> 2669.2
tobacco leaves ooh i would like some of

2665.92 --> 2671.92
those i got this and that and that

2669.2 --> 2676.2799999999997
change there you go

2671.92 --> 2676.28
no taxes no money exchanged

2677.839 --> 2682.0
all right and you can store tobacco

2679.76 --> 2683.3590000000004
leaves

2682.0 --> 2684.96
dry them

2683.359 --> 2687.2
and then you like put them in giant

2684.96 --> 2690.0
glass doors in jars

2687.2 --> 2694.2
and then you keep them very long time so

2690.0 --> 2694.2
it's like good trade ware

2713.359 --> 2720.4
right so look into it man i mean tobacco

2718.16 --> 2722.7999999999997
did you hear like my rant about it like

2720.4 --> 2725.599
a few days ago

2722.8 --> 2728.6400000000003
i really think that tobacco is actually

2725.599 --> 2731.2000000000003
been like attacked by the beast system

2728.64 --> 2734.4
that big tobacco

2731.2 --> 2737.1189999999997
was weirdly enough set up

2734.4 --> 2738.8
for straw man reasons like they were set

2737.119 --> 2740.88
up because their products yeah gave

2738.8 --> 2742.5600000000004
people cancer and all that lung cancer

2740.88 --> 2745.52
especially

2742.56 --> 2746.48
and the tobacco was blamed for that and

2745.52 --> 2749.839
they said

2746.48 --> 2752.079
no tobacco doesn't cause it and weirdly

2749.839 --> 2753.44
enough you could argue that they were

2752.079 --> 2754.7200000000003
right

2753.44 --> 2757.839
it's just

2754.72 --> 2760.7999999999997
not just tobacco in their products the

2757.839 --> 2763.7599999999998
[ __ ] they put in there on top

2760.8 --> 2766.96
does actually cause it

2763.76 --> 2766.96
so it's all been

2767.119 --> 2771.119
like

2767.92 --> 2772.48
slandered into infamy

2771.119 --> 2775.28
tobacco

2772.48 --> 2778.079
raw tobacco plants organically grown is

2775.28 --> 2779.119
actually very therapeutical and arguably

2778.079 --> 2781.52
healthy

2779.119 --> 2783.359
to a certain degree i mean you

2781.52 --> 2784.8
might not want to just smoke all day

2783.359 --> 2786.0789999999997
long you're still going to get some

2784.8 --> 2787.44
issues then

2786.079 --> 2788.5600000000004
just from the

2787.44 --> 2790.56
there's still going to be carbon

2788.56 --> 2793.04
monoxide and all that sort of stuff

2790.56 --> 2795.52
there's going to be byproducts always

2793.04 --> 2799.8
but if it's just raw

2795.52 --> 2799.8
it's really not that terrible

2814.16 --> 2817.1189999999997
i'm holding

2817.68 --> 2820.68
okay

2835.599 --> 2838.96
wait there's an app

2837.76 --> 2842.7200000000003
ah

2838.96 --> 2844.7200000000003
yeah i'm i don't have a mobile so

2842.72 --> 2847.52
sometimes i it's like kind of sad that

2844.72 --> 2850.7999999999997
there isn't just like a a typical mobile

2847.52 --> 2854.559
interface for just pcs

2850.8 --> 2856.7200000000003
although maybe there will be one i mean

2854.559 --> 2858.4
i think at this point you can literally

2856.72 --> 2861.04
just emulate

2858.4 --> 2864.319
mobile phones on a computer you can

2861.04 --> 2867.04
emulate game consoles and all that and

2864.319 --> 2868.96
old older type computers

2867.04 --> 2870.88
so why wouldn't you be able to then

2868.96 --> 2875.28
emulate a mobile phone and then

2870.88 --> 2875.28
basically have this app stuff in there

2876.88 --> 2880.2400000000002
yeah get out of here

2882.16 --> 2885.16
hello

2890.0 --> 2893.2
derp alert

2891.28 --> 2894.7200000000003
we're seeking star wars

2893.2 --> 2896.48
i literally thought you were seeking

2894.72 --> 2900.3999999999996
star wars because she always said that

2896.48 --> 2902.4
now then i looked and was you terred

2900.4 --> 2904.2400000000002
i was gonna say oh hello seeking star

2902.4 --> 2908.359
wars oh wait no

2904.24 --> 2908.359
it wasn't her that said it

2927.839 --> 2932.4
wow jet fuel

2929.76 --> 2935.6800000000003
really literally jet fuel

2932.4 --> 2937.52
i was hurt that they put like ammonia

2935.68 --> 2939.839
that they traded the tobacco with

2937.52 --> 2942.559
ammonia to make it like more addictive

2939.839 --> 2944.5589999999997
and that that's actually really bad

2942.559 --> 2946.079
never heard of this jet fuel before that

2944.559 --> 2948.559
is

2946.079 --> 2950.96
bizarre

2948.559 --> 2950.96
urine

2954.839 --> 2959.92
what to download on pc windows okay

2967.119 --> 2970.119
okay

2972.24 --> 2974.8799999999997
could i

2973.119 --> 2978.92
get that link

2974.88 --> 2978.92
i'd like to check that out

2984.4 --> 2988.96
it can be like i know territ i know

2986.8 --> 2991.2000000000003
you're totally right with that it is an

2988.96 --> 2993.04
immediate conscious response exactly

2991.2 --> 2995.359
it's just that

2993.04 --> 2996.839
seeking star wars kind of started it so

2995.359 --> 2999.68
for me it's like

2996.839 --> 3001.52
immediate like oh

2999.68 --> 3003.5989999999997
there she is

3001.52 --> 3006.48
but you're right it should i

3003.599 --> 3008.7200000000003
agree everybody should say that

3006.48 --> 3011.28
well find your own ways you know

3008.72 --> 3013.359
everybody literally uses a uniform

3011.28 --> 3014.8
response that will get kind of

3013.359 --> 3017.04
boring

3014.8 --> 3017.04
but

3017.359 --> 3023.159
it is a great description

3020.03 --> 3023.159
[Music]

3039.52 --> 3044.319
to pay app oh

3041.76 --> 3044.3190000000004
five dollars

3047.52 --> 3051.839
people in my area okay yeah well i live

3049.76 --> 3052.8390000000004
in the netherlands so

3051.839 --> 3057.119
i'm in

3052.839 --> 3059.44
finland dude if i was in finland

3057.119 --> 3061.76
it the weather wouldn't be looking like

3059.44 --> 3061.76
this

3062.319 --> 3065.7599999999998
oh camera freeze

3069.04 --> 3076.92
i mean it's freaking hot out here man

3072.48 --> 3076.92
no but i'm in the netherlands actually

3095.359 --> 3100.4
and i have no idea if there's like

3097.52 --> 3103.04
actual people that are part of bears

3100.4 --> 3105.44
here although maybe some farmers i bet

3103.04 --> 3108.64
there's some farmers that

3105.44 --> 3111.839
that love that [ __ ] that are re i i like

3108.64 --> 3111.839
they would have to be

3113.52 --> 3116.92
so yeah

3129.359 --> 3132.4
dick pound bear

3136.72 --> 3140.72
wow that's really cool right away

3138.319 --> 3143.839
bearplegic i'm i'm really glad that your

3140.72 --> 3143.839
business is rolling

3147.359 --> 3151.2
just like your wheelchair sorry i'll

3149.68 --> 3153.839
stop it

3151.2 --> 3153.839
uh

3155.44 --> 3158.55
[Music]

3166.0 --> 3168.64
what is that

3175.68 --> 3178.68
woof

3194.72 --> 3197.72
goody

3224.16 --> 3228.7999999999997
okay why did you link up with that

3226.079 --> 3228.8
letter sage

3229.359 --> 3234.48
and it seems kind of generic i thought

3231.359 --> 3234.48
that there was going to be some

3234.839 --> 3240.88
actual non-standard

3237.76 --> 3240.88
information in there

3243.52 --> 3247.839
oh whoa tear it no

3246.88 --> 3250.48
look

3247.839 --> 3252.96
it's simple

3250.48 --> 3255.119
if you haven't smoked and you don't have

3252.96 --> 3256.96
an impulse

3255.119 --> 3259.52
you don't have a calling

3256.96 --> 3262.4
then don't

3259.52 --> 3264.72
you don't it's not like oh you really

3262.4 --> 3267.2000000000003
need that tobacco to get to the next

3264.72 --> 3268.7999999999997
level no not really

3267.2 --> 3270.8799999999997
and the same goes by the way for

3268.8 --> 3273.8390000000004
cannabis

3270.88 --> 3278.4
i mean i really appreciate cannabis

3273.839 --> 3279.7599999999998
although it can be challenging sometimes

3278.4 --> 3282.2400000000002
but

3279.76 --> 3284.1600000000003
and i like to refer to

3282.24 --> 3287.2
the rastafari

3284.16 --> 3288.8799999999997
refuse rastafarianism

3287.2 --> 3290.3999999999996
and that it can be

3288.88 --> 3292.2400000000002
planned to christ

3290.4 --> 3293.52
but that doesn't mean you have to do

3292.24 --> 3296.319
that

3293.52 --> 3298.799
right it's only if you have the calling

3296.319 --> 3299.68
don't let anybody tell you you must do

3298.799 --> 3302.799
that

3299.68 --> 3304.72
you have to try it no you don't

3302.799 --> 3306.799
if you feel like it if you if you're

3304.72 --> 3308.799
just like

3306.799 --> 3309.92
hmm

3308.799 --> 3310.96
right

3309.92 --> 3313.599
i mean

3310.96 --> 3317.28
there's other stuff that i have like

3313.599 --> 3318.1600000000003
sporadic that i've like tried once

3317.28 --> 3320.7200000000003
ugh

3318.16 --> 3323.2
and i re like even well i don't regret

3320.72 --> 3325.2799999999997
trying it but i certainly realize that

3323.2 --> 3328.64
after that but like i'm never i'm never

3325.28 --> 3330.7200000000003
even gonna try that again this is [ __ ]

3328.64 --> 3333.04
right well with tobacco

3330.72 --> 3335.5989999999997
it's different

3333.04 --> 3336.96
because with tobacco it's going to be

3335.599 --> 3339.6800000000003
[ __ ] gross

3336.96 --> 3341.839
always the first time is always just

3339.68 --> 3344.0
[ __ ] gross

3341.839 --> 3346.72
like the taste and [ __ ] that's like

3344.0 --> 3349.839
really [ __ ] disgusting to trust me on

3346.72 --> 3351.359
this i still remember

3349.839 --> 3354.4
but you get used to it and then

3351.359 --> 3355.359
eventually it's not that gross anymore

3354.4 --> 3358.799
but

3355.359 --> 3360.0
it's not really worth it

3358.799 --> 3363.7599999999998
right

3360.0 --> 3368.0
unless for example you typically have

3363.76 --> 3369.3590000000004
a flustered mind concentration problems

3368.0 --> 3371.119
that's where

3369.359 --> 3373.839
you might

3371.119 --> 3376.1600000000003
want to try it because traditionally it

3373.839 --> 3377.92
was typically

3376.16 --> 3381.2
tobacco attributed to help for

3377.92 --> 3381.2000000000003
concentration issues

3382.72 --> 3387.4399999999996
but

3384.319 --> 3387.44
that's really like

3391.2 --> 3397.1189999999997
i can't just like make it a universal

3394.0 --> 3399.839
recommendation like that

3397.119 --> 3399.839
you gotta just

3400.079 --> 3405.44
be careful

3402.559 --> 3406.4
i mean there is consequences on the long

3405.44 --> 3408.319
run

3406.4 --> 3410.079
like you will

3408.319 --> 3412.079
like even if you don't get cancer or

3410.079 --> 3413.52
anything your lungs are gonna have

3412.079 --> 3418.079
trouble

3413.52 --> 3419.92
like i have less lung capacity now

3418.079 --> 3422.319
palpably and i know it's going to even

3419.92 --> 3424.88
shrink so you basically by smoking even

3422.319 --> 3428.96
if you do it all the right way you know

3424.88 --> 3430.799
pure leaves no no cigarette crap

3428.96 --> 3433.839
your lung capacity is still going to

3430.799 --> 3433.839
shrink over time

3433.92 --> 3437.6800000000003
and so times where you can barely get

3435.839 --> 3439.599
any air normally

3437.68 --> 3441.2799999999997
you're going to even have more trouble

3439.599 --> 3442.319
you might even be like

3441.28 --> 3444.0
help

3442.319 --> 3445.599
right that's going to happen then

3444.0 --> 3447.839
throughout your life you're gonna have

3445.599 --> 3447.839
to

3448.24 --> 3455.1189999999997
be aware that that will happen

3451.76 --> 3457.44
it has a price using it

3455.119 --> 3459.599
right not net the price is not

3457.44 --> 3463.52
necessarily lung cancer but there will

3459.599 --> 3463.52
be a price within your life

3463.92 --> 3468.16
so

3465.839 --> 3470.0789999999997
same goes for drinking well

3468.16 --> 3471.2
you've never drunk before

3470.079 --> 3472.1600000000003
really

3471.2 --> 3474.48
okay

3472.16 --> 3477.04
good

3474.48 --> 3479.2
i would not compare uh tobacco with

3477.04 --> 3482.5589999999997
drinking at all

3479.2 --> 3482.5589999999997
it's very different

3483.839 --> 3489.16
like drinking is potentially much more

3486.16 --> 3489.16
lethal

3490.0 --> 3494.079
also it is really

3492.24 --> 3494.9599999999996
drinking like really

3494.079 --> 3498.799
can

3494.96 --> 3502.2400000000002
over time if you do it too much

3498.799 --> 3503.68
without enough recovery period

3502.24 --> 3504.64
it will like

3503.68 --> 3508.64
just

3504.64 --> 3508.64
derange your inner chemistry

3510.16 --> 3512.5589999999997
and like

3512.64 --> 3518.799
it's not good drinking is like really

3515.04 --> 3518.799
not good on the long run

3522.64 --> 3529.16
don't stay up all night most days

3526.0 --> 3529.16
all right

3536.079 --> 3540.2400000000002
do you have a bear group in my country

3542.559 --> 3548.2400000000002
i well paraplegic i am not really all

3545.44 --> 3548.2400000000002
that connected

3549.599 --> 3553.3590000000004
american spirit

3551.92 --> 3555.839
oh

3553.359 --> 3555.839
you mean

3556.96 --> 3563.839
this american spirit

3559.76 --> 3567.599
yeah i know i've american spirit is like

3563.839 --> 3567.599
unfortunately it's not the organic

3568.72 --> 3573.68
right it's not the organic blend

3571.839 --> 3575.359
but

3573.68 --> 3577.9199999999996
yeah that's

3575.359 --> 3579.7599999999998
like i wouldn't even try anything else

3577.92 --> 3581.44
out there

3579.76 --> 3583.76
it's the only one that isn't like

3581.44 --> 3585.52
utterly disgusting to me

3583.76 --> 3588.48
so you're right there

3585.52 --> 3588.48
very policy bear

3588.559 --> 3592.96
unfortunately we don't get the organic

3590.72 --> 3594.5589999999997
variety of that here in the netherlands

3592.96 --> 3595.52
which is like a

3594.559 --> 3598.52
very

3595.52 --> 3598.52
annoying

3608.64 --> 3615.4
lung capacity at 15 jesus

3611.92 --> 3615.4
that's not good

3635.52 --> 3638.16
but anyway

3638.96 --> 3642.4
for me

3640.4 --> 3646.0
it's always been critical

3642.4 --> 3647.359
to not become a chain smoker

3646.0 --> 3649.04
right

3647.359 --> 3651.7599999999998
chain smokers do it because they're

3649.04 --> 3653.44
nervous they do it in a form of escapism

3651.76 --> 3654.2400000000002
and then focus

3653.44 --> 3657.68
but

3654.24 --> 3659.839
that's like really bad

3657.68 --> 3663.44
that's the way you're gonna like really

3659.839 --> 3663.44
shrink those lungs quick

3663.92 --> 3669.04
and so i make sure that i just don't

3666.799 --> 3671.599
smoke continually well a funny thing

3669.04 --> 3673.839
about smoking weed

3671.599 --> 3676.0
in the tobacco

3673.839 --> 3677.92
is that it's not like oh yeah man i just

3676.0 --> 3679.2
finished that let me light up another

3677.92 --> 3680.88
one

3679.2 --> 3683.839
no

3680.88 --> 3685.76
so that way

3683.839 --> 3688.0
smoke

3685.76 --> 3690.7200000000003
not that much tobacco either because i

3688.0 --> 3692.88
just don't smoke cigarettes unless i run

3690.72 --> 3694.799
out of cannabis

3692.88 --> 3696.96
and the cannabis use

3694.799 --> 3699.839
makes me smoke less

3696.96 --> 3699.839
tobacco

3700.48 --> 3704.88
isn't that just hilarious

3702.48 --> 3704.88
anyway

3709.599 --> 3713.04
other brands in washington that are made

3711.28 --> 3717.039
by indians that have no chemicals that

3713.04 --> 3717.0389999999998
is very interesting where villagic wear

3718.079 --> 3721.039
what i do

3719.28 --> 3722.96
besides this buying this in the

3721.039 --> 3724.3190000000004
netherlands here in shops

3722.96 --> 3727.359
is

3724.319 --> 3728.88
i i've ordered twice from a company in

3727.359 --> 3731.359
the united states

3728.88 --> 3733.76
two different ones that just sent me

3731.359 --> 3735.52
whole dried leaves in like a giant

3733.76 --> 3737.44
plastic bag

3735.52 --> 3739.7599999999998
just the whole leaves and then i have to

3737.44 --> 3741.359
cut them up myself but it was very well

3739.76 --> 3743.3590000000004
worth it

3741.359 --> 3745.7599999999998
it was very cheap

3743.359 --> 3748.48
compared to like having to buy packets

3745.76 --> 3750.88
all the time but it is quite an initial

3748.48 --> 3752.559
investment

3750.88 --> 3755.6800000000003
like

3752.559 --> 3758.079
i have to spend 200 euros in one go and

3755.68 --> 3761.7599999999998
then it will take

3758.079 --> 3763.039
like half a year if i'm lucky

3761.76 --> 3764.7200000000003
or maybe like

3763.039 --> 3766.48
three months to half a year before it

3764.72 --> 3768.72
even gets there so

3766.48 --> 3770.319
i would like to do that but yeah i don't

3768.72 --> 3773.52
really have a

3770.319 --> 3775.7599999999998
lot of money to invest like that

3773.52 --> 3777.359
anyway

3775.76 --> 3779.76
my lung capacity gets worse in the

3777.359 --> 3779.7599999999998
summer

3780.48 --> 3784.559
well that is kind of typical slow mo

3782.559 --> 3787.44
moon buggy because

3784.559 --> 3789.599
well the air gets thinner

3787.44 --> 3791.52
in the summer so it might not be your

3789.599 --> 3793.28
lanka fat it's simply the air getting

3791.52 --> 3794.319
thinner

3793.28 --> 3796.1600000000003
right

3794.319 --> 3798.88
like in the winter the air gets more

3796.16 --> 3798.8799999999997
compacted

3800.0 --> 3805.44
but then if there's like too much moist

3802.079 --> 3809.319
in it then that can also be

3805.44 --> 3809.319
yeah not too great

3823.2 --> 3827.9199999999996
now the government with taxes yeah

3826.16 --> 3829.359
in the uk well have you seen the

3827.92 --> 3830.799
netherlands

3829.359 --> 3833.7599999999998
i mean

3830.799 --> 3835.28
they tax it for like 80

3833.76 --> 3836.0
80

3835.28 --> 3840.559
or

3836.0 --> 3842.16
sorry let me reverse that 400 percent so

3840.559 --> 3844.799
it's basically

3842.16 --> 3846.799
four times as expensive as the real

3844.799 --> 3850.559
product even is

3846.799 --> 3853.799
because of freaking taxes totally mental

3850.559 --> 3853.799
and ridiculous

3856.079 --> 3861.039
and in the meantime they literally also

3858.799 --> 3863.839
like your you can't enjoy it you can't

3861.039 --> 3866.0
have any associates it's all black

3863.839 --> 3868.96
but they still leave the disgusting

3866.0 --> 3871.52
photos of like

3868.96 --> 3873.359
medical disaster [ __ ]

3871.52 --> 3875.28
they leave that on there it's like what

3873.359 --> 3877.359
the [ __ ] are you doing

3875.28 --> 3880.1600000000003
this is like a direct psychological

3877.359 --> 3881.0389999999998
assault like i could probably in time

3880.16 --> 3883.1189999999997
prove

3881.039 --> 3886.4
that putting those [ __ ] pictures on

3883.119 --> 3889.76
there is probably gonna cause

3886.4 --> 3893.44
directly cause those types of injury

3889.76 --> 3895.599
more than just smoking this [ __ ]

3893.44 --> 3897.119
this is so ridiculous

3895.599 --> 3900.079
it's like

3897.119 --> 3903.44
it is literally medically irresponsible

3900.079 --> 3905.8390000000004
to put pictures like that onto tobacco

3903.44 --> 3907.52
you're literally like assaulting people

3905.839 --> 3909.7599999999998
like with a horror movie that they don't

3907.52 --> 3910.64
want to see

3909.76 --> 3914.079
yeah

3910.64 --> 3917.44
you implant them with suggestions

3914.079 --> 3920.0
showing that [ __ ] may literally trigger

3917.44 --> 3922.319
that on the long run psychosomatically

3920.0 --> 3925.68
if you see it enough it is a direct

3922.319 --> 3928.4
psychological spiritual assault on your

3925.68 --> 3931.1189999999997
health that they do that

3928.4 --> 3933.92
not the tobacco even with this

3931.119 --> 3936.6400000000003
disgusting [ __ ] that is in that

3933.92 --> 3940.079
through mega corporations no the

3936.64 --> 3943.7599999999998
pictures the pictures are a direct

3940.079 --> 3946.76
spiritual psychological assault on the

3943.76 --> 3946.76
public

3961.76 --> 3966.0
they're literally

3963.599 --> 3968.6400000000003
attacking it is like a spiritual

3966.0 --> 3970.64
mandated vaccine

3968.64 --> 3973.44
that just kills you

3970.64 --> 3975.68
that's that's what they've done

3973.44 --> 3975.68
and

3975.76 --> 3981.119
i don't know if i can do anything about

3977.839 --> 3983.68
it but i would love to see that entire

3981.119 --> 3986.0
thing wiped off the map within my

3983.68 --> 3989.1189999999997
lifetime

3986.0 --> 3992.48
make tobacco free again and make tobacco

3989.119 --> 3993.92
unpoisoned make tobacco small

3992.48 --> 3998.799
again

3993.92 --> 3998.799
everybody grow your own little plants

3999.599 --> 4003.92
and anybody can buy it from anybody and

4002.319 --> 4007.0389999999998
[ __ ] your taxes

4003.92 --> 4008.48
zero tax yeah

4007.039 --> 4014.44
zero

4008.48 --> 4014.44
zero tax on tobacco zero forever

4018.68 --> 4021.71
[Music]

4047.28 --> 4050.88
i hate to be reminded of the effects of

4048.96 --> 4053.079
smoking on my health yeah especially

4050.88 --> 4054.799
when a lot of those things are

4053.079 --> 4056.88
blatantly

4054.799 --> 4058.319
blatantly

4056.88 --> 4060.48
obviously

4058.319 --> 4063.359
not actually caused

4060.48 --> 4065.92
by smoking yeah

4063.359 --> 4065.92
it isn't

4070.64 --> 4075.0389999999998
correlation is not causation

4073.92 --> 4078.0
yeah

4075.039 --> 4081.599
if you dump all levels of poisonous [ __ ]

4078.0 --> 4084.2
in your body through pharmaceuticals

4081.599 --> 4087.76
psychological [ __ ] drugs and

4084.2 --> 4090.319
operations and side drugs and disgusting

4087.76 --> 4091.8390000000004
oh oh oh but he also smoked oh look at

4090.319 --> 4094.48
what he got all this

4091.839 --> 4096.0
man he's got a hot rotten jaw yeah

4094.48 --> 4098.799
that's because he's been [ __ ]

4096.0 --> 4102.0
poisoning himself with all that crap

4098.799 --> 4104.319
other than tobacco

4102.0 --> 4107.199
and yeah oh surprise surprise yeah

4104.319 --> 4107.1990000000005
that's what you get

4112.56 --> 4117.1990000000005
it's a giant straw man

4115.359 --> 4119.92
just projecting

4117.199 --> 4122.5599999999995
the nightmare onto you like you will get

4119.92 --> 4125.679
that you don't

4122.56 --> 4127.1990000000005
unless you actually believe it and by

4125.679 --> 4129.12
believing it

4127.199 --> 4130.639999999999
letting that belief linger in the

4129.12 --> 4134.719
background

4130.64 --> 4137.719
then you will invoke it potentially

4134.719 --> 4137.719
psychosomatics

4156.4 --> 4161.839
we should ever start it

4158.48 --> 4161.839
well then just stop

4165.6 --> 4170.400000000001
i mean it's not pleasant to stop but you

4168.48 --> 4173.959999999999
can

4170.4 --> 4173.96
just get a grip

4174.4 --> 4177.759
i've stopped

4176.08 --> 4179.839
in the past

4177.759 --> 4183.56
and yeah it sucked but you can

4179.839 --> 4183.5599999999995
definitely do that

4198.0 --> 4201.0
anyway

the beast system demands help people

4486.08 --> 4491.36
quit smoking that's the only thing

4488.719 --> 4492.88
you're supposed to do now

4491.36 --> 4494.639999999999
yeah no

4492.88 --> 4495.679
not gonna be doing that

4494.64 --> 4498.2390000000005
i mean

4495.679 --> 4499.84
good luck with your danny flathead

4498.239 --> 4502.239
but

4499.84 --> 4505.84
i'm gonna keep smoking though

4502.239 --> 4507.759999999999
and because i do i'd like to do it

4505.84 --> 4509.4400000000005
the most effective way with the least

4507.76 --> 4511.92
damage

4509.44 --> 4515.919999999999
and that includes

4511.92 --> 4518.08
lies that have been thrown in your face

4515.92 --> 4520.4800000000005
for you to believe

4518.08 --> 4524.0
that will actually cause damage yeah

4520.48 --> 4525.759999999999
beliefs can cause damage

4524.0 --> 4527.36
to you

4525.76 --> 4528.88
especially if it concerns your own

4527.36 --> 4531.759999999999
health you're

4528.88 --> 4534.32
afraid that something may cause

4531.76 --> 4534.320000000001
something

4535.04 --> 4539.6
even if you don't want to believe it if

4536.8 --> 4541.76
you're constantly facing it it will seep

4539.6 --> 4541.76
in

4543.04 --> 4545.199
right

4543.92 --> 4547.92
so

4545.199 --> 4551.919999999999
i'd like to just make up my own [ __ ]

4547.92 --> 4553.4400000000005
mind and smoke until i die a very very

4551.92 --> 4556.08
old man

4553.44 --> 4561.32
without lung cancer

4556.08 --> 4561.32
because that is absolutely achievable

4569.03 --> 4572.2
[Music]

4603.12 --> 4606.84
right so i want to talk about something

4605.12 --> 4609.679
else now this is

4606.84 --> 4612.32
not the subject that i wanted to talk

4609.679 --> 4612.32
about today

4614.88 --> 4619.679
horrible

4616.0 --> 4619.679
you're a freaking larper dude

4620.0 --> 4626.88
you're just here to make it look bad

4623.12 --> 4626.88
aren't you danny flathead

4630.8 --> 4635.8
i'm gonna kick you out if this is real

4642.64 --> 4648.320000000001
like why the hell are you even smoking

4645.12 --> 4652.719
if you have a terrible cough

4648.32 --> 4654.799999999999
like hello freaking impulses

4652.719 --> 4658.6
like why would you even want to smoke

4654.8 --> 4658.6
when you have a cough

4664.159 --> 4669.36
i i'm done with this just get out

4667.52 --> 4671.84
and you can

4669.36 --> 4671.839999999999
shut up

4672.32 --> 4676.5599999999995
right so let's move on

4674.56 --> 4680.0
let's stop being distracted by this

4676.56 --> 4682.56
puppetry in my chat here

4680.0 --> 4686.719
right he's taking his advice

4682.56 --> 4688.56
go do that now you can [ __ ] off

4686.719 --> 4691.88
because i don't think you're actually a

4688.56 --> 4691.88
real person

4692.0 --> 4694.56
big bill bell

4693.52 --> 4697.280000000001
is just

4694.56 --> 4699.52
puppeting the [ __ ] out of the situation

4697.28 --> 4701.04
because he's probably fanatically

4699.52 --> 4703.040000000001
anti-smoking

4701.04 --> 4704.84
and passive aggressively

4703.04 --> 4707.6
projecting his

4704.84 --> 4710.719
resolve on my show

4707.6 --> 4710.719
and i will not have it

4716.32 --> 4719.5199999999995
yeah

4717.12 --> 4722.159
so danny flat hat you might be real i

4719.52 --> 4725.52
don't need to hear about your ugly cough

4722.159 --> 4727.759999999999
yeah it's your freaking problem

4725.52 --> 4730.2390000000005
i'm talking about tobacco and how it

4727.76 --> 4732.8
doesn't give you lung cancer

4730.239 --> 4734.959999999999
about how big tobacco has literally

4732.8 --> 4737.6
poisoned their products

4734.96 --> 4739.52
in order to cause

4737.6 --> 4743.04
a slander

4739.52 --> 4746.400000000001
slanderous rumor about tobacco

4743.04 --> 4749.36
they have tried to destroy it

4746.4 --> 4753.599999999999
and the beast system only does that

4749.36 --> 4753.599999999999
when something is actually really good

4756.08 --> 4763.84
if you don't like that and you can [ __ ]

4758.96 --> 4763.84
off get the [ __ ] out of my show

4769.76 --> 4775.6
and yeah i i actually have

4772.64 --> 4778.2390000000005
people in the family and indirect family

4775.6 --> 4781.360000000001
that have died of lung cancer that's

4778.239 --> 4782.48
right my grandfather my dad's dad died

4781.36 --> 4786.0
from that

4782.48 --> 4788.08
so did my brother's dad

4786.0 --> 4790.56
yeah i know what that is yeah you know

4788.08 --> 4793.76
what i also know about it

4790.56 --> 4796.4800000000005
both of them were tenacious big tobacco

4793.76 --> 4799.679
smokers yeah they didn't actually take

4796.48 --> 4802.959999999999
care they were lazy smokers they just

4799.679 --> 4805.76
wanted to keep going chain smokers they

4802.96 --> 4808.719
didn't grow their own leaves

4805.76 --> 4812.320000000001
they use it as escapism they took the

4808.719 --> 4816.159
poison and then they died from it yeah

4812.32 --> 4819.5199999999995
big tobacco not tobacco

4816.159 --> 4822.0
big tobacco not gonna fall for this [ __ ]

4819.52 --> 4822.0
anymore

4822.08 --> 4828.44
so is anybody still in here i'd like to

4824.719 --> 4828.44
move on with the conversation

4841.12 --> 4844.4
good

4842.48 --> 4847.839999999999
the best way going about it flat

4844.4 --> 4847.839999999999
smacking your mom

4848.32 --> 4852.32
okay

4849.52 --> 4853.6
so how much does your mom even

4852.32 --> 4856.08
know you

4853.6 --> 4858.4800000000005
ladder sage

4856.08 --> 4862.08
because that's the most important part

4858.48 --> 4863.44
like how does your mother even see you

4862.08 --> 4866.48
does she care

4863.44 --> 4869.759999999999
does she know that you're

4866.48 --> 4871.44
a fringe thinker is what how a normie

4869.76 --> 4872.8
would see it

4871.44 --> 4874.879999999999
right

4872.8 --> 4877.360000000001
so in order to flat smack anybody that's

4874.88 --> 4880.0
close to you first got to see if they

4877.36 --> 4884.88
are capable of

4880.0 --> 4884.88
integrating such a knowledge upgrade

4885.28 --> 4890.88
through the person that is communicating

4887.6 --> 4893.120000000001
that to them which is you

4890.88 --> 4893.12
right

4898.239 --> 4903.678999999999
so basically how is your relationship

4900.48 --> 4905.28
with your mom

4903.679 --> 4909.12
how it is

4905.28 --> 4912.159
will very likely reveal how

4909.12 --> 4912.159
she will respond

4914.88 --> 4920.400000000001
grandma was all praises yeah gooder than

4916.48 --> 4920.4
you territ that that's awesome

4920.639 --> 4928.159000000001
but yeah that's also india

4924.239 --> 4928.159
so it's much more logical

4929.12 --> 4932.48
on average

4931.28 --> 4934.719
they have been

4932.48 --> 4938.44
slightly less ball indoctrinated because

4934.719 --> 4938.44
of religious roots

4970.08 --> 4974.8
right so you have letters say i'd love

4971.679 --> 4978.4
to like elaborate

4974.8 --> 4980.320000000001
but it's essential to first know

4978.4 --> 4982.4
the angle of approach through the

4980.32 --> 4983.5199999999995
relationship first you got to know the

4982.4 --> 4984.839999999999
target

4983.52 --> 4988.639
then you

4984.84 --> 4990.719
can bring it to the target in order and

4988.639 --> 4993.76
yeah because then you can

4990.719 --> 4995.36
predict how they might respond either

4993.76 --> 4997.84
way because they could still make a

4995.36 --> 5000.32
choice either way but then if you know

4997.84 --> 5002.4800000000005
them and how they see you then you can

5000.32 --> 5004.719
accurately predict

5002.48 --> 5006.32
where it will go either way and make a

5004.719 --> 5008.2390000000005
choice make a

5006.32 --> 5010.5599999999995
balanced

5008.239 --> 5010.5599999999995
choice

5013.76 --> 5017.52
thinks the moon landing's being picked

5015.36 --> 5020.159
okay that's a good start

5017.52 --> 5020.159000000001
definitely

5020.8 --> 5026.320000000001
you might

5023.199 --> 5026.32
you might want to

5026.639 --> 5030.96
build that ladder right build the

5028.8 --> 5033.76
staircase some more i mean there's are

5030.96 --> 5036.159
more things beyond the moon landing

5033.76 --> 5039.8
right does she know about the the whole

5036.159 --> 5039.799999999999
vaccine [ __ ]

5043.84 --> 5047.6
right

5045.12 --> 5050.239
oh the moon landing right it's pretty

5047.6 --> 5051.360000000001
basic but yeah other

5050.239 --> 5053.759999999999
other

5051.36 --> 5055.12
situations explain it one by one and

5053.76 --> 5057.04
then

5055.12 --> 5059.679
when she when you can feel like yeah

5057.04 --> 5062.08
she's fully on board with that that's

5059.679 --> 5064.32
when you then should start like

5062.08 --> 5067.199
let me now get back to the moon landing

5064.32 --> 5067.199
where they started

5067.52 --> 5073.040000000001
why do you think that they did fake it

5071.52 --> 5074.56
right

5073.04 --> 5077.6
and then

5074.56 --> 5080.159000000001
maybe she already has a suspicion

5077.6 --> 5082.400000000001
maybe she'll just like laughingly say

5080.159 --> 5085.04
like haha well probably because the

5082.4 --> 5089.199
earth is flat right haha

5085.04 --> 5089.199
and then like yeah actually

5089.52 --> 5091.360000000001
i don't know

5090.2 --> 5094.0
[Music]

5091.36 --> 5096.239
that's how i would do it just build up

5094.0 --> 5099.92
this the

5096.239 --> 5102.0
the staircase piece by piece

5099.92 --> 5104.08
so that they are kind of on the

5102.0 --> 5105.6
intellectual level that they can move up

5104.08 --> 5107.84
and down there with me in the

5105.6 --> 5110.2390000000005
conversation

5107.84 --> 5113.04
get used to it and then

5110.239 --> 5115.839999999999
you can basically show the

5113.04 --> 5118.239
the crossroads on the hourglass which is

5115.84 --> 5120.32
flat earth

5118.239 --> 5124.36
first they gotta be able to walk the

5120.32 --> 5124.36
staircase a bit

5126.4 --> 5131.12
ooh she already had the gb not sure i'd

5129.199 --> 5133.36
mention it

5131.12 --> 5135.92
shouldn't you

5133.36 --> 5135.92
shouldn't you

5138.48 --> 5145.678999999999
i mean if you want

5140.639 --> 5145.679
sorry pgc you would actu wait oh wait

5146.0 --> 5150.56
oh yeah that's

5147.92 --> 5154.639
the other person

5150.56 --> 5158.080000000001
could convince her to it

5154.639 --> 5158.08
then you're going to have a tough time

5166.159 --> 5171.92
that sucks by the way but uh yeah

5170.159 --> 5173.36
if she's taking the shot that's going to

5171.92 --> 5175.4400000000005
be tough

5173.36 --> 5178.159
because then that's like a really big

5175.44 --> 5180.48
barrier inside

5178.159 --> 5182.5599999999995
i still do that i'd still tell her like

5180.48 --> 5183.5199999999995
yeah maybe you just shouldn't really do

5182.56 --> 5185.76
that

5183.52 --> 5188.080000000001
because it's actually not what they say

5185.76 --> 5190.320000000001
it is and

5188.08 --> 5193.04
i'd almost say you'd have to confront

5190.32 --> 5195.12
her with that before you go to flat

5193.04 --> 5196.96
earth

5195.12 --> 5200.88
unless you know she's gonna literally

5196.96 --> 5204.0
become really hurt or something and then

5200.88 --> 5204.0
then just don't

5204.1 --> 5207.289000000001
[Music]

5208.4 --> 5211.4
uh

5212.0 --> 5215.89
[Music]

5225.52 --> 5229.719
believe in human cause good

5251.84 --> 5258.360000000001
right well pgcnet your parents are then

5254.56 --> 5258.360000000001
at least in a good position

5269.679 --> 5275.6
oh jesus christ you do

5273.199 --> 5278.48
son of a [ __ ]

5275.6 --> 5280.4800000000005
flatter a sage

5278.48 --> 5282.48
you really do that

5280.48 --> 5285.48
holy [ __ ]

5282.48 --> 5285.48
okay

5296.4 --> 5299.599999999999
that's a little freaky

5301.36 --> 5305.839999999999
i mean technic i like i don't do that

5306.08 --> 5312.48
i like i would never do that personally

5309.76 --> 5315.280000000001
but then again i'm like always very sort

5312.48 --> 5317.28
of like timid when it comes to sound it

5315.28 --> 5320.96
might be because of my mother that was

5317.28 --> 5322.639
like always complaining about sound

5320.96 --> 5325.92
always like

5322.639 --> 5325.92
mariber's doing this

5326.88 --> 5332.159000000001
so i just learned to like okay

5329.36 --> 5334.639
how do i go about listening music

5332.159 --> 5338.08
watching movies playing video game

5334.639 --> 5340.2390000000005
whatever without a single sound being

5338.08 --> 5342.5599999999995
heard

5340.239 --> 5344.5599999999995
so even like if i play music here or

5342.56 --> 5347.04
whatever it's like

5344.56 --> 5349.6
i'll enjoy it it'll be loud enough for

5347.04 --> 5351.28
me but it will not be audible anywhere

5349.6 --> 5354.2390000000005
that's

5351.28 --> 5356.96
sort of have this weird

5354.239 --> 5361.12
owl habit you could say just make sure

5356.96 --> 5361.12
that you're not hurt intuitively almost

5361.76 --> 5366.320000000001
but okay if yeah i do say share on any

5364.4 --> 5368.08
platform you deem fit and that means

5366.32 --> 5370.239
playing it on your phone in the middle

5368.08 --> 5374.159
of a store or something as well even

5370.239 --> 5374.159
though it i do think that is a bit

5374.88 --> 5380.56
i don't know if that is really

5378.239 --> 5382.799999999999
good social behavior

5380.56 --> 5382.8
but

5382.96 --> 5386.0
i'll leave it up to you

5390.32 --> 5394.48
headphones yeah i don't i hate

5391.92 --> 5396.639
headphones

5394.48 --> 5399.28
but then again i don't even go out with

5396.639 --> 5399.28
my phone

5399.6 --> 5405.52
like really i don't i don't have

5403.12 --> 5408.08
a smartphone

5405.52 --> 5412.080000000001
you have a regular phone

5408.08 --> 5414.32
i always leave it here unless i need it

5412.08 --> 5416.639
if i'm going to go some distance and i

5414.32 --> 5418.96
need to be able to contact somebody for

5416.639 --> 5420.400000000001
if something goes wrong

5418.96 --> 5422.159
that's it

5420.4 --> 5425.839999999999
i never even take my phone with me

5422.159 --> 5425.839999999999
grocery shopping like ever

5432.4 --> 5435.839999999999
and i don't like have a

5435.92 --> 5444.32
like a ipod or anything either i just

5440.08 --> 5447.5199999999995
out there i listen i look

5444.32 --> 5449.759999999999
i'm i'm taking it all in it's like i'm

5447.52 --> 5452.2390000000005
absorbing all that

5449.76 --> 5453.679
visual and auditory information for as

5452.239 --> 5457.919999999999
long as i can

5453.679 --> 5460.2390000000005
while everybody just seemingly wastes it

5457.92 --> 5464.2390000000005
walking like almost getting hit by cars

5460.239 --> 5464.239
and [ __ ] like that still happens guys

5465.679 --> 5469.92
i mean they don't it seems like

5467.44 --> 5472.32
everybody's just barely missing

5469.92 --> 5475.1990000000005
accidents but they just noticed that

5472.32 --> 5477.679
people are just freaking walking

5475.199 --> 5480.0
and even crossing the road

5477.679 --> 5483.679
staring in their [ __ ] mobile and i'm

5480.0 --> 5483.679
like i don't believe

5483.92 --> 5489.28
how so many of them survive this i don't

5487.12 --> 5491.04
understand how that's even possible like

5489.28 --> 5492.719
they should be

5491.04 --> 5494.8
just getting killed through their own

5492.719 --> 5497.12
stupidity i don't understand how they're

5494.8 --> 5498.01
surviving this

5497.12 --> 5499.199
ugh

5498.01 --> 5502.1990000000005
[Music]

5499.199 --> 5502.199
anyway

5524.639 --> 5530.719
right but trying to get back

5527.36 --> 5530.719
aren't so easily hurt either

5530.84 --> 5536.159000000001
right like some

5533.28 --> 5539.199
zombies staring at phones yeah

5536.159 --> 5539.199
but also just

5540.159 --> 5546.5599999999995
apparently not taking the risks of

5543.36 --> 5548.159
normal life that serious they just think

5546.56 --> 5550.159000000001
no i'm gonna cross the road and if a

5548.159 --> 5550.96
cars has come a car is coming they'll

5550.159 --> 5552.799999999999
just

5550.96 --> 5555.12
they'll watch out for me that's

5552.8 --> 5557.12
literally how people sometimes go about

5555.12 --> 5560.92
out there and i'm like what the hell are

5557.12 --> 5560.92
you doing you idiot

5561.28 --> 5565.759999999999
like one day

5563.92 --> 5567.4400000000005
you know you're gonna cross that road

5565.76 --> 5569.92
staring in your phone thinking

5567.44 --> 5571.36
everything will be all right

5569.92 --> 5574.88
wow

5571.36 --> 5577.12
a car goes driving by

5574.88 --> 5579.04
and they're just getting a text message

5577.12 --> 5581.92
when they're really nervous about

5579.04 --> 5585.28
getting a text message and they'll look

5581.92 --> 5586.4
and they'll run you straight over

5585.28 --> 5590.5599999999995
right

5586.4 --> 5590.5599999999995
because of the same damn phone thing

5591.679 --> 5597.1990000000005
i don't understand why people do that

5595.12 --> 5598.239
why they

5597.199 --> 5599.919999999999
like

5598.239 --> 5602.0
don't pay more attention to their

5599.92 --> 5605.88
environment just for their own basic

5602.0 --> 5605.88
safety i don't get it

5621.44 --> 5625.44
how hard it is to cross roads in busy

5623.679 --> 5626.719
india city

5625.44 --> 5628.839999999999
yeah

5626.719 --> 5631.76
yeah i've seen the videos there

5628.84 --> 5634.32
terrence yeah you're not gonna

5631.76 --> 5635.52
oh man that would be hilarious by the

5634.32 --> 5638.88
way

5635.52 --> 5641.6
as a mock video that somebody in india

5638.88 --> 5642.719
like at those highly you could probably

5641.6 --> 5645.84
edit it

5642.719 --> 5648.8
or something edit it together somebody

5645.84 --> 5650.8
in india whether the crazy crossing

5648.8 --> 5652.159000000001
points where literally everybody drive

5650.8 --> 5654.2390000000005
through each other and just somehow

5652.159 --> 5656.879999999999
doesn't hit each other

5654.239 --> 5659.12
and then somebody like staring in their

5656.88 --> 5661.28
phone just crossing

5659.12 --> 5664.32
that traffic

5661.28 --> 5667.12
that would be hilarious

5664.32 --> 5670.199
and absolutely impossible in reality by

5667.12 --> 5670.199
the way

5673.04 --> 5678.719
although yeah i don't know maybe indian

5676.4 --> 5680.32
some indian tech wizard will find out a

5678.719 --> 5683.679
way to actually

5680.32 --> 5686.08
be able to use some kind of ai guide to

5683.679 --> 5688.8
literally stare in their phone like a

5686.08 --> 5690.719
gps to get through an extremely

5688.8 --> 5692.88
hectic crossing

5690.719 --> 5695.76
somebody some nerd out there might

5692.88 --> 5696.96
actually figure out a way to do that

5695.76 --> 5700.92
but

5696.96 --> 5700.92
in general no

5701.0 --> 5704.149
[Music]

5704.719 --> 5709.28
what

5706.239 --> 5709.28
really territ

5710.0 --> 5715.56
you what

5711.92 --> 5715.56
how does that work

5725.04 --> 5731.04
you need the app that tells you when

5727.28 --> 5731.04
it's safe across the room

5731.199 --> 5737.04
exactly geoshifter that's right that's

5734.0 --> 5739.52
that's sort of what i was talking about

5737.04 --> 5739.5199999999995
sort of

5740.159 --> 5744.4
god

5741.44 --> 5746.799999999999
can you imagine that

5744.4 --> 5749.679
traffic lights no longer actually being

5746.8 --> 5753.6
traffic lights but just like

5749.679 --> 5757.28
just a sign to tell you to check

5753.6 --> 5759.04
check the the the traffic light app on

5757.28 --> 5761.28
your phone

5759.04 --> 5762.8
not that by the way i actually use

5761.28 --> 5764.639
traffic lights

5762.8 --> 5766.96
i don't need to

5764.639 --> 5768.88
i literally don't even look at them

5766.96 --> 5771.04
right that's not entirely too at a

5768.88 --> 5772.32
distance i look at them in order to

5771.04 --> 5774.88
predict

5772.32 --> 5778.4
how the flow of traffic is going to be

5774.88 --> 5780.88
because i go past these traffic points

5778.4 --> 5783.36
and they know exactly by now by going

5780.88 --> 5784.4800000000005
past them for like hundreds of times

5783.36 --> 5787.679
exactly

5784.48 --> 5788.718999999999
how they function when what happens and

5787.679 --> 5790.719
how

5788.719 --> 5793.679
the entire dynamic

5790.719 --> 5795.6
and i will just like i ignore

5793.679 --> 5798.4800000000005
just i totally ignore

5795.6 --> 5800.4800000000005
lights just like no i go i know exactly

5798.48 --> 5802.5599999999995
when it's safe when i won't even

5800.48 --> 5803.839999999999
accidentally startle a driver or

5802.56 --> 5807.119000000001
something

5803.84 --> 5807.119000000001
i just know how to do it

5810.719 --> 5815.36
right the only times i don't do it is if

5813.119 --> 5817.679
there's like really little children on

5815.36 --> 5819.599999999999
their little bikes with their parents

5817.679 --> 5821.119
waiting in front of a

5819.6 --> 5823.52
traffic light that's the time when i'm

5821.119 --> 5826.5599999999995
like okay now i'm gonna stop because i'm

5823.52 --> 5827.84
not gonna give them an example like that

5826.56 --> 5829.84
at that age

5827.84 --> 5831.4400000000005
you're not ready to to do it like that

5829.84 --> 5834.159000000001
yet

5831.44 --> 5836.159
that kind of starts in the teens

5834.159 --> 5837.5199999999995
little children need that basic

5836.159 --> 5841.5599999999995
discipline

5837.52 --> 5841.56
so i wouldn't do that

5869.76 --> 5874.719
wow okay so

5872.8 --> 5876.719
it's just like an ant

5874.719 --> 5881.44
effect then

5876.719 --> 5881.44
you guys really are like ants i guess

5883.76 --> 5891.4400000000005
nobody gets in an accident like why

5886.8 --> 5891.4400000000005
ah it makes no sense but they just don't

5893.679 --> 5898.719
i guess maybe if yeah your people have

5896.32 --> 5901.04
been epigenetically programmed to do

5898.719 --> 5902.96
that for like over a thousand years so i

5901.04 --> 5905.119
guess you're just

5902.96 --> 5906.8
masters added naturally

5905.119 --> 5908.799999999999
and that's why almost nobody gets in an

5906.8 --> 5912.2390000000005
accident

5908.8 --> 5915.56
or does that actually still happen

5912.239 --> 5915.5599999999995
i don't know

5929.84 --> 5934.56
used to be wearing school bags crossing

5931.84 --> 5934.56
roads eating

5934.96 --> 5937.96
interesting

5943.36 --> 5947.5199999999995
oh

5944.719 --> 5949.76
what fork you even have fog

5947.52 --> 5949.76
oh

5950.84 --> 5957.92
jesus pedestrian accidents are rare

5955.119 --> 5957.92
okay that's good

5961.52 --> 5966.8
would it be a silly thing to ask you to

5963.76 --> 5970.639
like demonstrate one time

5966.8 --> 5972.8
like get somebody to film you doing that

5970.639 --> 5974.56
like just crossing the road when it's

5972.8 --> 5976.0
really hectic

5974.56 --> 5978.56
and just

5976.0 --> 5980.4
like to be re show you how easy it is

5978.56 --> 5983.88
for you i'd like to see that sometime

5980.4 --> 5983.879999999999
that would be interesting

5996.239 --> 5999.919999999999
and then oh by the way if you do that

5998.159 --> 6001.599999999999
try to have a

5999.92 --> 6003.679
like a

6001.6 --> 6006.639
looking onto the route

6003.679 --> 6009.52
type of view not just straight on seeing

6006.639 --> 6011.76
you walk away like that because

6009.52 --> 6013.92
yeah that you don't you gotta like have

6011.76 --> 6017.360000000001
a kind of a bit of a side view

6013.92 --> 6020.96
so you can see all the traffic coming

6017.36 --> 6023.839999999999
then you really see what you're doing

6020.96 --> 6023.84
anyway

6028.639 --> 6032.4800000000005
we do it like it's yeah but tara that's

6030.96 --> 6036.199
the point that's why i want you to

6032.48 --> 6036.199
actually show that

6036.8 --> 6040.400000000001
because

6038.0 --> 6042.8
well i can do it to a certain degree i

6040.4 --> 6044.5599999999995
mean i can do that effect effectively

6042.8 --> 6048.159000000001
here in the netherlands but it's not

6044.56 --> 6048.159000000001
super hectic at all

6048.96 --> 6054.4
a36 no that's not what i meant price

6051.36 --> 6056.08
that not territ walking around as he's

6054.4 --> 6058.96
crossing the road

6056.08 --> 6060.08
somebody filming him crossing the road

6058.96 --> 6061.84
as it

6060.08 --> 6065.6
because then you get to see also what

6061.84 --> 6067.92
passes behind him and all that

6065.6 --> 6069.679
just the 360 video crossing the road is

6067.92 --> 6071.36
not going to

6069.679 --> 6073.1990000000005
yeah it's just going to be like

6071.36 --> 6076.08
stuff moving and

6073.199 --> 6076.879999999999
it's not going to show you the viewer as

6076.08 --> 6079.6
to

6076.88 --> 6081.28
what's actually happening with herod

6079.6 --> 6084.320000000001
and that's the part i want to see i want

6081.28 --> 6086.96
to see like his stance as he's doing it

6084.32 --> 6089.36
that's what i want to see

6086.96 --> 6089.36
anyway

6089.52 --> 6094.56
do it or do it not tear it it doesn't

6091.52 --> 6094.56
really matter too much

6100.32 --> 6103.44
check out how back mumbai local trains

6102.48 --> 6105.04
get

6103.44 --> 6107.04
i've seen some of that like where

6105.04 --> 6110.48
they're like

6107.04 --> 6113.44
there's like a train and it's like

6110.48 --> 6116.759999999999
people like ah limbs just sticking out

6113.44 --> 6116.759999999999
so fast

6117.02 --> 6120.089000000001
[Music]

6123.17 --> 6126.359
[Music]

6135.28 --> 6137.5199999999995
huh

6141.6 --> 6144.400000000001
right anyway

6145.44 --> 6150.96
and today's show has been all over the

6147.52 --> 6154.0
place but it's already

6150.96 --> 6154.0
reaching the end

6154.719 --> 6158.36
of five minutes

6168.8 --> 6174.8
right so again i'd like to feed back to

6171.199 --> 6176.799999999999
the title of the show before i end it

6174.8 --> 6179.6
get back in your body

6176.8 --> 6181.360000000001
which is a reference

6179.6 --> 6184.0
that's what it's talking about yesterday

6181.36 --> 6186.48
with my healer about how you can be

6184.0 --> 6188.48
dislocated with your spirit not your

6186.48 --> 6191.04
consciousness with your spirit

6188.48 --> 6192.959999999999
dislocated from your body

6191.04 --> 6194.96
and then everything just will not

6192.96 --> 6198.0
function as it normally does you go into

6194.96 --> 6200.96
another modus it's like a standby

6198.0 --> 6202.56
modus for your body where your body even

6200.96 --> 6205.36
though your consciousness is there is

6202.56 --> 6207.76
like waiting for your spirit to return

6205.36 --> 6210.96
and fully integrate again because it

6207.76 --> 6214.719
needs that to actually properly function

6210.96 --> 6216.4
so even as i received that treatment

6214.719 --> 6217.6
for my healer

6216.4 --> 6220.08
it

6217.6 --> 6223.360000000001
can only be described as literally like

6220.08 --> 6227.04
a fountain of rejuvenation you literally

6223.36 --> 6230.48
feel younger when that happens

6227.04 --> 6232.96
and that's why getting back in your body

6230.48 --> 6235.839999999999
is a very important and good thing and

6232.96 --> 6238.2390000000005
extremely healthy for and like it just

6235.84 --> 6239.04
immediately restores hope

6238.239 --> 6240.5599999999995
right

6239.04 --> 6242.719
when you're feeling miserable and you

6240.56 --> 6244.8
intellectually know what's what and how

6242.719 --> 6247.36
to do things you can just still feel

6244.8 --> 6249.92
miserable well getting back in your body

6247.36 --> 6251.5199999999995
and i don't know how to do exactly what

6249.92 --> 6255.52
he does to me

6251.52 --> 6257.4400000000005
i really really want to learn to do that

6255.52 --> 6259.84
it's just that

6257.44 --> 6262.08
i can't do it exactly the way he does

6259.84 --> 6263.84
he's had like a lifetime of very

6262.08 --> 6265.6
specific

6263.84 --> 6267.76
type of training

6265.6 --> 6269.119000000001
it's not what i do

6267.76 --> 6271.679
but i am

6269.119 --> 6273.5199999999995
very desperate to somehow assimilate

6271.679 --> 6276.32
what he's done for myself and

6273.52 --> 6279.52
potentially others

6276.32 --> 6282.5599999999995
because getting back in your body

6279.52 --> 6285.1990000000005
with your spirit is like coming home

6282.56 --> 6286.56
and suddenly everything is like oh

6285.199 --> 6288.4
finally

6286.56 --> 6290.88
finally you're back home again and your

6288.4 --> 6293.36
body's like oh yeah let's go

6290.88 --> 6295.92
it's like immediately rejuvenation

6293.36 --> 6298.96
immediately like that that natural like

6295.92 --> 6301.679
let's go feeling all your organs

6298.96 --> 6304.4
deep bloat get back in their place you

6301.679 --> 6307.36
get hungry again

6304.4 --> 6310.0
everything smells right again you look

6307.36 --> 6311.759999999999
more clearly you hear everything without

6310.0 --> 6314.0
beeps

6311.76 --> 6317.4400000000005
that's getting back in your body

6314.0 --> 6320.08
to me and that's really what i

6317.44 --> 6321.599999999999
find out how to do that

6320.08 --> 6323.199
maybe the process is similar to

6321.6 --> 6324.56
biofeedback

6323.199 --> 6327.199
interesting

6324.56 --> 6328.719
interesting do you have any links for

6327.199 --> 6330.719
that

6328.719 --> 6332.2390000000005
because i'd like to cross-reference it

6330.719 --> 6334.32
with my healer

6332.239 --> 6336.0
to see if that is kind of close to what

6334.32 --> 6337.679
he does

6336.0 --> 6339.44
you got to realize he does everything

6337.679 --> 6344.32
over the phone

6339.44 --> 6345.28
yeah i've met him in person one time

6344.32 --> 6348.159
like

6345.28 --> 6348.159
eight years ago

6350.08 --> 6352.32
so

6355.28 --> 6360.08
yeah the genuine practitioners are

6357.6 --> 6362.56
difficult to find because

6360.08 --> 6364.159
devils take them

6362.56 --> 6366.639
literally they try to possess the

6364.159 --> 6369.5199999999995
healers because devils don't like it

6366.639 --> 6372.2390000000005
that healers can be that effective

6369.52 --> 6374.88
and they want them also to deal out

6372.239 --> 6376.879999999999
darkness to balance it out but the real

6374.88 --> 6380.4800000000005
healers don't do that

6376.88 --> 6382.32
so they get nagged yep my healer gets

6380.48 --> 6384.718999999999
nagged he has

6382.32 --> 6386.5599999999995
like digital stalkers

6384.719 --> 6389.04
and by the way they've been at it for

6386.56 --> 6392.2390000000005
like 20 years

6389.04 --> 6393.36
right through alternative medical

6392.239 --> 6395.5199999999995
sources

6393.36 --> 6398.08
right they hunt those well he's been

6395.52 --> 6400.4800000000005
involved in that and he's got that

6398.08 --> 6402.88
and through just pure spiritual stuff

6400.48 --> 6405.04
that isn't even on the record of the

6402.88 --> 6407.6
general public

6405.04 --> 6410.32
it's just so esoteric and spiritual like

6407.6 --> 6412.2390000000005
people like you can't even communicate

6410.32 --> 6414.5599999999995
like that and people

6412.239 --> 6415.919999999999
will not understand like i when they

6414.56 --> 6418.4800000000005
talk like that

6415.92 --> 6420.8
on that pure spirit talk and it is a

6418.48 --> 6423.119
pure spirit hook i think that

6420.8 --> 6425.84
gardner right the guy that comes on with

6423.119 --> 6428.4
uh own benjamin sometimes he can do that

6425.84 --> 6431.119000000001
too it is this very specific way it's

6428.4 --> 6433.119
spirit talking it is like angel talk

6431.119 --> 6434.48
it's very different

6433.119 --> 6437.759999999999
you're

6434.48 --> 6437.759999999999
i can't describe it

6437.84 --> 6442.1990000000005
i can decipher that

6442.56 --> 6445.679
what was i talking about

6447.84 --> 6451.679
right but the general public just don't

6449.84 --> 6453.360000000001
it just seems like gibberish it seems

6451.679 --> 6455.28
like hippy dippy gibberish to the

6453.36 --> 6457.44
general public that sort of talk they

6455.28 --> 6460.5599999999995
just can't follow it

6457.44 --> 6461.28
it's too energy it's it's

6460.56 --> 6465.280000000001
not

6461.28 --> 6467.84
earthed enough in a way

6465.28 --> 6469.5199999999995
like the spirit is earth the energy is

6467.84 --> 6472.32
earth it's all very balanced it's just

6469.52 --> 6474.719
that the the way the semantics roll out

6472.32 --> 6476.719
is just it becomes different because

6474.719 --> 6479.52
there's too many different things that

6476.719 --> 6482.84
are being addressed that aren't even on

6479.52 --> 6486.56
the radar normally with

6482.84 --> 6488.96
people this is yeah

6486.56 --> 6488.96
anyway

6489.44 --> 6495.36
i am rounding out the show

6492.32 --> 6497.28
thanks everyone for coming

6495.36 --> 6498.48
i hope you like this show i thought it

6497.28 --> 6500.48
was great

6498.48 --> 6502.959999999999
bit over the place

6500.48 --> 6505.119
but yeah good feeling and

6502.96 --> 6506.08
hope you got back in your body as the

6505.119 --> 6507.599999999999
title

6506.08 --> 6509.84
suggests

6507.6 --> 6512.719
that would be very good for you

6509.84 --> 6514.400000000001
rejuvenating experience you want that i

6512.719 --> 6516.8
want that there's nobody in the world

6514.4 --> 6518.799999999999
that doesn't want that

6516.8 --> 6521.1990000000005
there's only

6518.8 --> 6524.88
non-human

6521.199 --> 6526.96
entities that want you to not do that

6524.88 --> 6527.76
and you may think that you don't want

6526.96 --> 6530.4800000000005
that

6527.76 --> 6532.08
but that's actually the entity in you

6530.48 --> 6534.718999999999
that has taken you

6532.08 --> 6536.159
that convinces you that you do not want

6534.719 --> 6537.92
that or need that

6536.159 --> 6539.04
but you do

6537.92 --> 6541.36
right

6539.04 --> 6543.44
