6.299 --> 37.64
foreign

7.75 --> 37.64
[Music]

45.5 --> 50.539
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

48.96 --> 54.480000000000004
bird number

50.539 --> 56.160000000000004

78.42 --> 82.86
support so please keep it coming

81.299 --> 85.5
right

82.86 --> 89.06
the weather today

85.5 --> 89.06
that's actually pretty nice

89.58 --> 94.74
it's like half clouded half beautiful

92.04 --> 97.259
blue sky look at how blue that is

94.74 --> 99.41999999999999
uh hold on

97.259 --> 101.159
to get the camera

99.42 --> 105.9
to

101.159 --> 108.36
how do I get it to sharpen up

105.9 --> 110.96000000000001
I guess you have to trust me it's really

108.36 --> 110.96
deep blue

114.78 --> 120.56
ah maybe now yeah there you go see

121.2 --> 126.479
I mean that's almost purple looking Deep

124.32 --> 130.099
Blue

126.479 --> 130.099
so it is really clear

130.679 --> 133.94
and there's a lot of wind

137.94 --> 143.64
but it's still very nice and warm

141.06 --> 146.84
especially when the sun is out it's

143.64 --> 146.83999999999997
really been very pleasant

154.5 --> 159.959
all right

156.56 --> 162.18
so my plants are also doing fine except

159.959 --> 165.31900000000002
maybe yeah

162.18 --> 169.019
I think that these

165.319 --> 171.17999999999998
oregano plants are just not handling it

169.019 --> 174.78
I probably have to like

171.18 --> 178.37900000000002
figure out a more specialized setup

174.78 --> 180.66
because the the big potted one is

178.379 --> 181.98
basically drowning I have to continually

180.66 --> 184.68
empty it

181.98 --> 186.79999999999998
with water yeah yesterday was raining a

184.68 --> 186.8
lot

187.019 --> 193.68
right

189.3 --> 196.8
so I had to empty it out continually

193.68 --> 201.239
and it's like not looking too great

196.8 --> 203.34
it's gonna turn yellow and yeah I mean I

201.239 --> 205.68
suspect that it could probably die

203.34 --> 208.22
suddenly

205.68 --> 208.22
uh

209.28 --> 215.819
because of water injury

211.56 --> 217.08
anyway hello LSG first in chat Oz good

215.819 --> 220.159
to see you all

217.08 --> 226.019
it is Tuesday

220.159 --> 226.019
the first of August 2023

229.98 --> 234.79899999999998
check the temperature

232.2 --> 234.79899999999998
yeah

235.739 --> 239.36
20 degrees right

240.48 --> 246.42
oh and now it's super sunny and clear

243.239 --> 248.28
sky oh

246.42 --> 250.319
yesterday it said oh it's going to be

248.28 --> 251.34
very cloudy and rainy tomorrow now it

250.319 --> 253.07999999999998
says oh

251.34 --> 255.599
the entire week is going to be very

253.08 --> 257.82
cloudy and rainy except for today though

255.599 --> 259.26
where it's like a little cloudy and just

257.82 --> 260.699
very sunny

259.26 --> 263.759
hmm

260.699 --> 267.86
I wonder if today is going to be a

263.759 --> 267.86
little cloudy and very sunny as well

272.24 --> 277.62
I should I should actually potentially

275.04 --> 280.74
just show this because I keep talking

277.62 --> 283.58
about it but I never show the graph

280.74 --> 283.58
hmm

284.82 --> 289.15999999999997
I should update my Weather Service

294.419 --> 297.25899999999996
let's see

300.54 --> 306.02000000000004
yeah there you go here's the this is

303.18 --> 306.02
what I look at

307.259 --> 311.699
every time

309.9 --> 314.96
so yeah

311.699 --> 314.96000000000004
there you see the

315.3 --> 319.74
today oh look at the sunny and a bit of

317.58 --> 321.12
clouds but it's going to be really rainy

319.74 --> 325.039
tomorrow again

321.12 --> 325.039
and the rest of the week oh

325.44 --> 330.78
okay

327.96 --> 332.34
it didn't say that before

330.78 --> 335.17999999999995
that it would be this kind of weather

332.34 --> 335.17999999999995
today so

336.539 --> 341.699
yeah if it's going to be more of that

338.22 --> 343.5
I'm gonna keep showing it

341.699 --> 346.52000000000004
because this is like almost starting to

343.5 --> 346.52
get a bit suspicious

347.06 --> 351.66
maybe they're just trying to make it

349.68 --> 354.199
seem all gloomy

351.66 --> 354.199
anyway

355.139 --> 359.52
how are you guys doing

357.0 --> 361.86
I'm doing pretty good I had a day off

359.52 --> 363.71999999999997
yesterday

361.86 --> 366.66
and yeah again I'd like to remind

363.72 --> 368.82000000000005
everybody if I don't show up

366.66 --> 371.58000000000004
what do you do

368.82 --> 373.08
or you can go panicking and comets where

371.58 --> 374.88
were you where were you or you could

373.08 --> 376.5
check Twitter

374.88 --> 378.3
because

376.5 --> 379.5
pretty much no matter what if I'm not

378.3 --> 384.78000000000003
gonna show up

379.5 --> 388.199
I will notify in Twitter probably like

384.78 --> 390.55999999999995
yeah I would before the show time

388.199 --> 393.66
running would be over unless I'm like

390.56 --> 396.3
unexpectedly like needed somewhere like

393.66 --> 400.46000000000004
I'm pulled away because of something

396.3 --> 400.46000000000004
but I mean that never happens really

404.039 --> 408.12
I mean that sort of thing will probably

406.02 --> 411.18
would probably happen more if I had

408.12 --> 413.759
actually had a girlfriend but I don't

411.18 --> 418.22
hmm

413.759 --> 418.22
check the X app uh shout out

418.5 --> 424.759
Nathan yesterday oh it takes no it's

421.56 --> 424.759
it's still called Twitter

433.44 --> 439.8
I mean if it's gonna be called x com or

438.0 --> 442.259
something yeah that would be it's a game

439.8 --> 444.68
called that anyway if they're gonna

442.259 --> 446.28000000000003
change the website name to X and like

444.68 --> 447.78000000000003
[Music]

446.28 --> 450.599
all that

447.78 --> 453.17999999999995
then yeah I mean okay then it's just

450.599 --> 457.099
that but I mean

453.18 --> 457.099
it's not gonna be very popular

457.86 --> 461.06
such a change

464.58 --> 467.96
oh do you guys hear that

469.38 --> 474.65999999999997
I hope not but there's some

472.319 --> 476.88
work being done in the building it's

474.66 --> 478.38000000000005
been not it's not been terrible so far

476.88 --> 481.56
but

478.38 --> 483.979
yesterday it was actually

481.56 --> 483.979
uh

484.139 --> 491.22
right so I skipped out yesterday because

487.44 --> 492.89
I overslept and like I didn't have

491.22 --> 494.88000000000005
anything like I was actually

492.89 --> 496.8
[Music]

494.88 --> 499.68
dry out so

496.8 --> 502.62
and the weather sucked

499.68 --> 504.72
so I basically thought like nah I'm not

502.62 --> 507.599
gonna do the show I didn't

504.72 --> 510.59900000000005
I would have done it if I had been

507.599 --> 512.64
stocked up and like would have been fine

510.599 --> 515.52
it's not like oh I feel really terrible

512.64 --> 518.399
but it's just the combination of it all

515.52 --> 520.02
so I just went for groceries during the

518.399 --> 523.34
pre-show

520.02 --> 525.12
at fed early

523.34 --> 530.0600000000001
[Music]

525.12 --> 530.0600000000001
now I'm all back stuck back up I got it

531.98 --> 538.74
I got rookula oh God I love this stuff I

536.1 --> 540.9200000000001
had a couple of leaves before this it

538.74 --> 544.8
mean it's such a world difference

540.92 --> 547.38
and it goes to energy drink

544.8 --> 550.14
and mint tea as usual

547.38 --> 554.48
[Music]

550.14 --> 554.48
right some fully stocked

554.94 --> 560.36
for the show

556.62 --> 560.36
hello Richard G good to see you

567.0 --> 570.19
[Music]

582.66 --> 589.14
don't you choose to love people

586.08 --> 590.88
having work done in the house

589.14 --> 594.08
I mean they don't give a [ __ ] they're

590.88 --> 594.08
probably at work or something

594.32 --> 597.5
somewhere else

598.26 --> 600.98
huh

606.0 --> 613.339
right so yeah

609.0 --> 613.339
I'm I'm very open to whatever

615.0 --> 620.64
I had a decent rest well I have a pretty

617.82 --> 624.38
good rest actually but I mean I did have

620.64 --> 624.38
like lots of tension

625.32 --> 628.1
in my head

628.86 --> 636.66
and it's kind of interesting because

631.74 --> 640.44
well my magnetization really is a skill

636.66 --> 643.019
I can re I can just reroute tension and

640.44 --> 646.5600000000001
absorb it

643.019 --> 648.18
through my hand and all that but it's

646.56 --> 650.76
also

648.18 --> 654.56
I can feel very carefully what's

650.76 --> 654.56
happening so I've been kind of like

655.68 --> 660.779
I was basically trying to relieve some

657.959 --> 662.8199999999999
tension on my situation here

660.779 --> 664.2
it's like with the eye muscles but also

662.82 --> 666.9590000000001
just like

664.2 --> 670.2
yeah my teeth are not very great and I

666.959 --> 673.92
might have some sort of like slumbering

670.2 --> 676.9200000000001
infection stuff because of my teeth it's

673.92 --> 678.5999999999999
unfortunate but it's been like ongoing

676.92 --> 681.8389999999999
forever

678.6 --> 683.82
but that does actually pose a burden in

681.839 --> 686.4590000000001
certain phases of the day and which is

683.82 --> 688.86
usually like right before I go to bed

686.459 --> 691.8
and I noticed that if I smoke more

688.86 --> 695.16
there's more of it

691.8 --> 697.64
actually is again yeah that that's how

695.16 --> 697.64
it works

697.8 --> 702.5
so it's always a balancing act

699.839 --> 702.5
everything is

704.06 --> 710.5189999999999
but I had an opportunity because I did

707.579 --> 713.04
have decent amount of strength

710.519 --> 715.5600000000001
available like in my man Apple you could

713.04 --> 719.0999999999999
call it to do this kind of magnetization

715.56 --> 721.5
stuff before my my hand my arm basically

719.1 --> 723.779
like

721.5 --> 725.94
collapses like as if you were over

723.779 --> 727.8
training because that's how it works

725.94 --> 730.74
it's

727.8 --> 732.3599999999999
fueled by muscle tension in ways it's

730.74 --> 735.12
very interesting

732.36 --> 738.6
but in the end you end up basically like

735.12 --> 742.32
you've done something really strainful

738.6 --> 744.9590000000001
so it it kind of feels like uh weaker it

742.32 --> 746.4590000000001
like you have to relax it because it's

744.959 --> 748.68
like

746.459 --> 750.899
it's

748.68 --> 752.9399999999999
not like you pulled something but like

750.899 --> 755.519
right before that you just really tired

752.94 --> 757.0790000000001
it out that's what happens eventually

755.519 --> 760.4590000000001
but yeah

757.079 --> 763.56
I effectively just completely reroute

760.459 --> 765.8389999999999
what's happening and the funny thing is

763.56 --> 768.0189999999999
especially because it's so close to my

765.839 --> 768.019
face

768.2 --> 773.76
I can like Simon

771.0 --> 777.6
visualize

773.76 --> 779.22
the actual 10 like I can visually

777.6 --> 782.339
represent

779.22 --> 785.1
like what I'm feeling and even like what

782.339 --> 788.7600000000001
it is that is happening with my hand

785.1 --> 791.7
and like when it works and at what depth

788.76 --> 796.139
it works it's really [ __ ] fascinating

791.7 --> 798.24
dude my magnetization has like a depth

796.139 --> 800.7
10 centimeters

798.24 --> 802.38
and I really noticed that

800.7 --> 804.48
like I would like

802.38 --> 806.519
change to proximity I could really feel

804.48 --> 808.139
it and then it's like oh I hit just the

806.519 --> 810.48
right spot there

808.139 --> 812.88
and then I realized like where is that

810.48 --> 815.519
where I'm feeling that roughly like here

812.88 --> 816.8389999999999
okay how deep is that that's like 10

815.519 --> 819.18
centimeters

816.839 --> 821.4590000000001
and then like so that means that

819.18 --> 823.68
whatever I'm doing this field that I'm

821.459 --> 826.16
presumably creating because it reaches

823.68 --> 826.16
Beyond

826.2 --> 830.519
right it reaches beyond the actual

828.3 --> 834.24
physical limits of my hand

830.519 --> 836.88
and so yeah that's what I just

834.24 --> 841.7
back engineer

836.88 --> 841.7
that's and it's like really intense

845.899 --> 855.079
and I wonder also like is it a similar

850.019 --> 855.079
effect as to what acupuncture does

856.339 --> 863.339
like is there a connection somehow like

859.8 --> 865.3199999999999
yeah I'm really attractive

863.339 --> 867.6600000000001
engineer this thing

865.32 --> 869.88
right I got these skills I'm really

867.66 --> 873.3
using them I mean I'm basic because of

869.88 --> 876.42
these skills I'm able to

873.3 --> 879.18
probably permanently

876.42 --> 883.699
bypass any necessity of having to deal

879.18 --> 887.3389999999999
with doctors or even hospitals

883.699 --> 888.5999999999999
potentially permanently

887.339 --> 891.6
but

888.6 --> 893.6990000000001
I'd need further inquiry I need to

891.6 --> 895.62
figure out more about I need to know

893.699 --> 898.019
have more lore I need to have more

895.62 --> 901.139
wisdom also because

898.019 --> 905.1
there might be unexpected swings that

901.139 --> 907.62
could prove very risky if I'm unprepared

905.1 --> 909.899
because entropies does still apply it's

907.62 --> 913.8
like things do always get worse it's all

909.899 --> 917.519
about how do you deal with it and when

913.8 --> 920.2199999999999
does the risk factor become intangible

917.519 --> 922.74
right because I'm not excluding that I

920.22 --> 926.639
would have like surgery or something

922.74 --> 929.339
but I mean it it would really well it

926.639 --> 931.62
has to be financially possible

929.339 --> 933.72
and it would have to be very clear that

931.62 --> 936.26
that is

933.72 --> 939.779
like necessary from all perspectives

936.26 --> 942.54
including German new medicine fuel

939.779 --> 945.42
because Germany medicine like

942.54 --> 947.699
my healer and others they do admit like

945.42 --> 950.4799999999999
there are some things that can just kind

947.699 --> 950.4799999999999
of grow out of control

951.3 --> 958.8599999999999
you could say it's like unexpected

954.6 --> 960.4200000000001
interest rates from compounded

958.86 --> 962.5790000000001
trauma

960.42 --> 965.06
it's pretty that's a pretty good

962.579 --> 968.959
description actually

965.06 --> 968.959
compounded interest from

969.72 --> 974.76
compounded yeah unexpected side effect

972.0 --> 977.54
from compounded

974.76 --> 977.54
trauma

978.839 --> 985.139
and because it yeah it's the same

982.079 --> 987.1389999999999
toxicity rule basically so it's it's

985.139 --> 991.139
fascinating how that works it's like

987.139 --> 991.139
energy drama

991.62 --> 996.839
the ability to absorb and assimilate

995.459 --> 1001.8199999999999
nutrient

996.839 --> 1003.62
nutrients so very it's like hyper it's

1001.82 --> 1006.1990000000001
like it's the same freaking Spectrum

1003.62 --> 1009.04
it's all the same it's terrain Theory it

1006.199 --> 1009.04
really works

1009.199 --> 1011.62
right

1012.139 --> 1015.92
so you have to take into account all

1013.94 --> 1020.24
those factors

1015.92 --> 1022.06
yeah I'm basically improvising

1020.24 --> 1025.28
system building

1022.06 --> 1029.6789999999999
right here

1025.28 --> 1029.6789999999999
with raw data that I just acquired

1034.9 --> 1039.38
adaptive forecast

1037.459 --> 1042.559
and predicts

1039.38 --> 1043.8190000000002
and make better decisions concerning my

1042.559 --> 1046.76
own

1043.819 --> 1049.1
medical situation

1046.76 --> 1051.919
anyways

1049.1 --> 1054.1999999999998
oh man just Boris the hell out of your

1051.919 --> 1056.72
maybe your old zoned in I don't know

1054.2 --> 1058.82
it's hard to tell

1056.72 --> 1061.179
yeah either way

1058.82 --> 1061.1789999999999
right

1066.88 --> 1070.7
I still wonder like are there other

1069.44 --> 1073.4
people

1070.7 --> 1076.52
I'm so open and pronounced about my

1073.4 --> 1079.64
abilities right with this magnetization

1076.52 --> 1083.36
which is really what that's the thing

1079.64 --> 1087.039
that I originally thought it was also my

1083.36 --> 1087.039
dad also has the ability

1087.08 --> 1091.8799999999999
but

1088.7 --> 1094.7
he never does it like with the tension

1091.88 --> 1096.5590000000002
which is really like it's another thing

1094.7 --> 1098.66
you do it's like you have like the

1096.559 --> 1100.7
healing on hand you just get the soft

1098.66 --> 1102.559
hand and you're like really

1100.7 --> 1103.88
pile on the love it's something you do

1102.559 --> 1105.9189999999999
with your spirit

1103.88 --> 1108.6200000000001
and then it's like it can like become

1105.919 --> 1110.3600000000001
really hot and it like has this healing

1108.62 --> 1112.3999999999999
effect not just hot

1110.36 --> 1113.6
like a lot of people do that with their

1112.4 --> 1115.94
children when their children are

1113.6 --> 1117.6789999999999
frightened rev works really well my

1115.94 --> 1119.9
parents did that with me when I was a

1117.679 --> 1122.66
little kid too when I was right and it

1119.9 --> 1126.3200000000002
just works right

1122.66 --> 1129.0800000000002
so there is that ability it's like a

1126.32 --> 1131.24
Spirit ability that's kind of like it's

1129.08 --> 1133.1799999999998
like normal people just do it it's just

1131.24 --> 1135.74
instinctual

1133.18 --> 1138.26
[Music]

1135.74 --> 1140.96
but there's other things too and and

1138.26 --> 1144.02
when my parents basically

1140.96 --> 1146.0
I got interested in Magic like oh and my

1144.02 --> 1148.52
parents basically explained or my dad

1146.0 --> 1151.419
like explained it to me like oh yeah

1148.52 --> 1151.4189999999999
this is what I do

1152.059 --> 1156.559
and he wasn't entirely sure back then

1154.46 --> 1159.38
because he hadn't really studied into

1156.559 --> 1161.12
like alternative medicine yet still very

1159.38 --> 1163.64
young

1161.12 --> 1165.559
and we were all really ignorant my

1163.64 --> 1168.26
mother was the least ignorant but she

1165.559 --> 1170.66
was really ignorant still

1168.26 --> 1173.26
said just dipped her fingers in more

1170.66 --> 1173.26
sources

1173.48 --> 1179.0
back then but I mean that really changed

1176.78 --> 1181.039
dramatically like so much after that

1179.0 --> 1183.559
it's like a waterfall of information

1181.039 --> 1186.2
that came over all of us

1183.559 --> 1188.0
separately

1186.2 --> 1191.1200000000001
so we need television and the internet

1188.0 --> 1194.66
and just people we met

1191.12 --> 1194.6599999999999
computer developments

1195.679 --> 1200.72
anyway

1197.419 --> 1203.0
I learned the the magnetization sort of

1200.72 --> 1205.52
by accident

1203.0 --> 1207.559
because I was very young

1205.52 --> 1211.1
my dad's like yeah you'd put the hand on

1207.559 --> 1213.26
and I did like that and I was like okay

1211.1 --> 1215.7199999999998
I got impatient

1213.26 --> 1217.76
yeah this I got impatient when I was

1215.72 --> 1220.76
there I was like

1217.76 --> 1223.16
I I wasn't ready I wasn't in the right

1220.76 --> 1225.26
frame of mind to pile on the love right

1223.16 --> 1227.179
so I couldn't do it

1225.26 --> 1230.679
then I got like

1227.179 --> 1233.8400000000001
um I'll do it like I want it it's like

1230.679 --> 1236.179
right very typical reaction I would

1233.84 --> 1238.1
wouldn't you say like especially for a

1236.179 --> 1242.1200000000001
little kid you get impatient like I

1238.1 --> 1243.4399999999998
wanted but guess what it's like ow

1242.12 --> 1248.0
because

1243.44 --> 1250.7
I suddenly felt pain it's like

1248.0 --> 1252.919
wait that's your pain

1250.7 --> 1255.74
so it's like I discovered like whoa I

1252.919 --> 1257.0
just I just absorbed that because I

1255.74 --> 1259.039
tensed it up

1257.0 --> 1262.059
and it's like what what

1259.039 --> 1262.059
and then it was like

1262.46 --> 1269.419
I could feel what it feels like

1265.7 --> 1271.22
I could lit it's like I I I felt it like

1269.419 --> 1274.94
it was my own I could

1271.22 --> 1277.58
and I with my own feelings and even pain

1274.94 --> 1280.5800000000002
sensation I can very it's very fine tune

1277.58 --> 1283.52
as to what the nature of it is because

1280.58 --> 1286.6399999999999
of the pain because yeah this sounds

1283.52 --> 1289.22
maybe a bit morbid or something but like

1286.64 --> 1292.159
yeah I have

1289.22 --> 1295.76
some people taste wine and then they can

1292.159 --> 1299.419
tell every difference well I can this

1295.76 --> 1302.24
sounds really dark I can taste pain and

1299.419 --> 1303.0800000000002
then feel exactly what the nature of it

1302.24 --> 1305.96
is

1303.08 --> 1308.96
like as if it were wine this yeah I know

1305.96 --> 1311.48
but I mean it's I I guess it falls under

1308.96 --> 1313.58
necromancy or something but I use it

1311.48 --> 1315.919
positively

1313.58 --> 1319.34
unless somebody makes me really hate

1315.919 --> 1323.0200000000002
them and then I I do admit I kind of

1319.34 --> 1326.48
tend to abuse the knowledge of it

1323.02 --> 1328.8799999999999
which is not good but I mean

1326.48 --> 1331.64
I don't push it too far

1328.88 --> 1332.9
like people don't actually like get hurt

1331.64 --> 1334.3400000000001
or anything

1332.9 --> 1336.44
just

1334.34 --> 1337.8799999999999
it mostly just makes me look really

1336.44 --> 1340.7
freaking dark

1337.88 --> 1341.679
all right anyway the getting often a

1340.7 --> 1344.9
tangent

1341.679 --> 1347.9
I figured out that you can tense up and

1344.9 --> 1350.799
then absorb it and then it's like

1347.9 --> 1350.799
I really

1351.08 --> 1357.5
[Music]

1353.36 --> 1360.26
no way no that wasn't when I was young

1357.5 --> 1364.28
no I figured it out later

1360.26 --> 1367.299
I remember that my yeah I

1364.28 --> 1371.299
it didn't work yet

1367.299 --> 1375.52
huh wow I

1371.299 --> 1375.52
I basically just

1376.76 --> 1381.98
mix two situations together that are not

1379.64 --> 1384.6200000000001
really tied together because now I'm

1381.98 --> 1387.919
remembering it correctly

1384.62 --> 1391.28
I actually like literally figured out

1387.919 --> 1395.0
the magnetization part as a team

1391.28 --> 1396.799
with my first x with my first girlfriend

1395.0 --> 1399.14
because she was the one that actually

1396.799 --> 1402.86
like did that he she did the tension

1399.14 --> 1404.539
thing and I felt it really like whoa I'm

1402.86 --> 1406.58
feeling something

1404.539 --> 1408.559
even though they she wouldn't be

1406.58 --> 1411.1399999999999
touching me

1408.559 --> 1414.1399999999999
but that was much later but my parent my

1411.14 --> 1416.179
dad did use like The Healing Hands and I

1414.14 --> 1418.7
could actually do that

1416.179 --> 1420.919
I don't know where the hell that I got

1418.7 --> 1422.419
impatient from but I mean it that could

1420.919 --> 1424.8200000000002
happen though

1422.419 --> 1425.6000000000001
but I'm like kind of shocked because I

1424.82 --> 1427.58
thought

1425.6 --> 1429.32
for a moment for real that that was

1427.58 --> 1431.72
actually what had happened but it wasn't

1429.32 --> 1433.9399999999998
okay

1431.72 --> 1436.64
right so what really happened I was a

1433.94 --> 1438.88
little kid lay on hands I could do that

1436.64 --> 1438.88
too

1440.84 --> 1447.62
I could just do it but if I was shocked

1444.799 --> 1449.84
out of it like somebody like affronted

1447.62 --> 1451.9399999999998
like some darkness that happened then I

1449.84 --> 1454.039
couldn't do it it would only when I was

1451.94 --> 1456.2
feeling and trusting and surrounded by

1454.039 --> 1458.6
loved ones and

1456.2 --> 1461.0
that I could just be myself and

1458.6 --> 1462.32
there's no danger then it worked really

1461.0 --> 1464.96
well

1462.32 --> 1467.539
but if it was surrounded by people that

1464.96 --> 1470.02
I couldn't trust then I wouldn't be able

1467.539 --> 1470.02
to do it

1470.96 --> 1475.82
because at times I would try that and

1473.48 --> 1477.6200000000001
then like people the people some [ __ ]

1475.82 --> 1480.1
up people would like literally like

1477.62 --> 1482.539
physically attack you

1480.1 --> 1484.82
unexpectedly if they noticed that I was

1482.539 --> 1488.919
doing that that happened so that it's

1484.82 --> 1488.9189999999999
actually the Jesuit guy literally

1490.46 --> 1495.8600000000001
if I remember that correctly

1492.799 --> 1498.559
or maybe that's just Dark World stuff

1495.86 --> 1501.74
this probably Dark World stuff

1498.559 --> 1505.28
yeah so it's the devil

1501.74 --> 1507.44
that sounds crazy right yeah because

1505.28 --> 1511.299
the Jesuit guy

1507.44 --> 1511.299
I was a real guy that I really knew

1511.82 --> 1517.46
he was also the form of the devil in the

1515.419 --> 1520.159
big Dark World Fishing it took me very

1517.46 --> 1522.74
long before to figure that out like I

1520.159 --> 1525.3200000000002
hadn't realized that for years

1522.74 --> 1527.059
that it wasn't actually him I only

1525.32 --> 1529.039
figured it out when I really like in a

1527.059 --> 1531.44
calm Moment Like addressed him about it

1529.039 --> 1532.58
like do you have this memory of doing

1531.44 --> 1534.74
that

1532.58 --> 1537.559
and he said and he like said no and he

1534.74 --> 1539.779
wasn't lying at all

1537.559 --> 1541.34
like I could tell with him

1539.779 --> 1543.44
now

1541.34 --> 1546.4399999999998
like it was because of the way it was

1543.44 --> 1548.3600000000001
feeling like when he lies you can't do

1546.44 --> 1551.419
that when he's like feeling in certain

1548.36 --> 1554.299
like very positive way

1551.419 --> 1555.98
and if he feels the need to then he will

1554.299 --> 1558.2
immediately cut that off and he would

1555.98 --> 1559.76
always do it like that so I knew he was

1558.2 --> 1561.8600000000001
telling the truth

1559.76 --> 1563.48
and that's really when the first moment

1561.86 --> 1565.6999999999998
I started to realize like I'm [ __ ]

1563.48 --> 1568.64
crazy

1565.7 --> 1571.64
that was like in my 20s

1568.64 --> 1575.3600000000001
right anyway to get freaking tangents

1571.64 --> 1578.3600000000001
man freaking tangents I'm so sorry guys

1575.36 --> 1581.1789999999999
the magnetization yeah

1578.36 --> 1583.039
I've learned me lay on hands it's very

1581.179 --> 1587.919
typical I think a lot of people do that

1583.039 --> 1587.919
it's maybe a dad thing especially

1588.14 --> 1594.88
if you have big hands and you're strong

1590.539 --> 1594.8799999999999
you typically can do as like

1596.539 --> 1601.58
they enhance your insert energy warmth

1599.539 --> 1603.98
and yeah it's associated with like

1601.58 --> 1606.1399999999999
safety and trust it works really good

1603.98 --> 1610.9
against fear or shock

1606.14 --> 1610.9
right but then later as a teenager

1611.179 --> 1615.5
my ex

1613.46 --> 1617.6000000000001
first girlfriend she basically had that

1615.5 --> 1619.039
skill and she just introduced it to me

1617.6 --> 1622.2199999999998
she's just like oh did you know that she

1619.039 --> 1623.0
was into UFOs into paranormal stuff so

1622.22 --> 1625.88
yeah

1623.0 --> 1628.64
that was she taught me that

1625.88 --> 1631.7
and like I turned out like I was really

1628.64 --> 1634.46
good at it like immediately like dude I

1631.7 --> 1636.26
used to have magnetization so strong but

1634.46 --> 1638.3600000000001
it's really my youthful energy that

1636.26 --> 1642.2
enabled me to do it that strong

1638.36 --> 1645.1999999999998
that I could do it at like this where

1642.2 --> 1647.3600000000001
does that half a meter distance

1645.2 --> 1650.059
I could literally like

1647.36 --> 1653.059
it was almost creepy and I thought like

1650.059 --> 1654.5
oh I have magical powers yeah I mean if

1653.059 --> 1657.26
you could do it that kind of that's

1654.5 --> 1659.12
pretty magical now

1657.26 --> 1660.98
I don't do it like that anymore because

1659.12 --> 1662.84
it wastes a lot of energy to do it like

1660.98 --> 1666.26
that

1662.84 --> 1667.6399999999999
it really was about bragging more but I

1666.26 --> 1670.58
got another technique where I'm

1667.64 --> 1672.74
basically like spending less energy but

1670.58 --> 1676.84
can still do it like really intensely

1672.74 --> 1676.84
except it's a shorter distance

1677.72 --> 1683.84
and then it's like I do this I do the

1680.36 --> 1686.12
claw but it's like this energy right

1683.84 --> 1689.799
it's almost like there's beams coming

1686.12 --> 1689.799
out of it like this on the other side

1691.22 --> 1697.94
it's like a diamond tip and it's super

1694.52 --> 1700.58
focused right here at the tip

1697.94 --> 1703.1000000000001
so I basically make a spirit tool with

1700.58 --> 1706.3999999999999
my hands using magnetization

1703.1 --> 1709.58
and I'm so curious as to like Aura

1706.4 --> 1713.299
cameras like could you could you

1709.58 --> 1716.12
actually see it could you actually like

1713.299 --> 1717.62
see the energy of what that is I've

1716.12 --> 1720.08
never

1717.62 --> 1723.1999999999998
had the opportunity to like directly

1720.08 --> 1724.8799999999999
study it in such a way be very

1723.2 --> 1727.8400000000001
fascinated to

1724.88 --> 1727.8400000000001
to do that

1731.48 --> 1737.32
anyway let me read the chat hello moon

1734.9 --> 1737.3200000000002
buggy

1738.19 --> 1741.42
[Music]

1743.32 --> 1749.799
what the

1745.24 --> 1749.799
friend's father was Art okay

1750.1 --> 1754.779
President Reagan heart surgeon okay

1761.44 --> 1767.1200000000001
right so you had like this weird setting

1764.899 --> 1769.299
where

1767.12 --> 1771.6789999999999
your life was almost like

1769.299 --> 1774.98
semi-television or gossip magazine

1771.679 --> 1777.14
because you like just bumped into all

1774.98 --> 1779.299
this kind of stuff

1777.14 --> 1781.3990000000001
I've had I've known people that had that

1779.299 --> 1784.48
too

1781.399 --> 1784.4799999999998
it's phases though

1787.76 --> 1791.899
it's like a momentum with energy it's

1790.039 --> 1794.059
like you're going in the Stream you're

1791.899 --> 1796.1589999999999
really strong and then that sort of

1794.059 --> 1798.26
thing kind of starts to happen

1796.159 --> 1801.679
like

1798.26 --> 1804.02
in my late teens that happened to me too

1801.679 --> 1806.26
sort of it happened more than before all

1804.02 --> 1806.26
that

1807.81 --> 1811.6399999999999
[Music]

1814.179 --> 1820.159
I mean

1817.0 --> 1823.64
I've had some interesting things like

1820.159 --> 1828.5200000000002
that like like I met David Ike in person

1823.64 --> 1831.679
was unexpected but really cool and

1828.52 --> 1833.6
it's there was so much intuitive

1831.679 --> 1836.8990000000001
information there it's like all the

1833.6 --> 1839.6
spiritual like I got a real good feel of

1836.899 --> 1842.059
David ick who that guy really is and

1839.6 --> 1843.5
like what he's doing and what's behind

1842.059 --> 1845.0
it

1843.5 --> 1847.94
like

1845.0 --> 1852.159
because he was like really open like he

1847.94 --> 1855.44
was genuinely open and unafraid

1852.159 --> 1858.64
that was in 2000

1855.44 --> 1858.64
11 I think

1858.799 --> 1866.0
that's some funny little

1862.22 --> 1868.7
they have many thing like a mini fair

1866.0 --> 1869.539
near Utrecht I wasn't even living here

1868.7 --> 1872.48
then

1869.539 --> 1876.3799999999999
was very near here

1872.48 --> 1878.659
and yeah that was great it was like a

1876.38 --> 1880.159
free energy

1878.659 --> 1883.0390000000002
at

1880.159 --> 1886.8200000000002
free energy conference sort of thing

1883.039 --> 1889.7
technology free energy and

1886.82 --> 1890.96
and like

1889.7 --> 1893.24
yeah

1890.96 --> 1895.82
integral Tech

1893.24 --> 1898.159
interested oh that it was like all this

1895.82 --> 1899.899
curiosity is like this it was like a

1898.159 --> 1902.96
science it was technically a freaking

1899.899 --> 1905.539
science fair it felt like a mini science

1902.96 --> 1907.279
fair and it was amazing it was so

1905.539 --> 1910.279
privileged that that was around and that

1907.279 --> 1914.02
I could be that I was able to just go

1910.279 --> 1914.02
there to such places

1915.32 --> 1920.059
I think that time I went I'm not sure

1919.159 --> 1921.98
though

1920.059 --> 1925.1
I went with

1921.98 --> 1927.2
that friend yeah I think I did

1925.1 --> 1929.6
like we went a couple of places together

1927.2 --> 1931.94
like we were like best buds for a while

1929.6 --> 1936.2199999999998
until Flat Earth and then it

1931.94 --> 1936.22
yeah until we had that encounter

1939.2 --> 1943.22
and then a lot of the weird magic also

1941.72 --> 1945.679
stop

1943.22 --> 1949.159
there was he was there was something

1945.679 --> 1952.46
magical happening like I and it's not

1949.159 --> 1954.679
Mandela effect like it's just like it's

1952.46 --> 1958.6000000000001
just this thing is on this energy is on

1954.679 --> 1958.6000000000001
and then weird things start to happen

1959.299 --> 1964.179
I think it's more related to

1961.159 --> 1964.179
synchronicity energy

1964.94 --> 1969.76
because synchronicity energy is its own

1967.52 --> 1969.76
thing

1978.26 --> 1984.799
right so I met David Ike

1980.779 --> 1987.38
I met the then Prince of the Netherlands

1984.799 --> 1992.059
at my work because I worked in a

1987.38 --> 1995.2990000000002
catering industry in my teens and one

1992.059 --> 1996.559
time yeah William Alexander was just

1995.299 --> 1999.1399999999999
sitting there

1996.559 --> 2001.84
but he looked freaking grumpy I really

1999.14 --> 2003.76
wanted to walk up to him and like kind

2001.84 --> 2007.36
of

2003.76 --> 2009.46
be like oh my Lord but I would not like

2007.36 --> 2011.3799999999999
that but I felt that like I was like

2009.46 --> 2013.96
basically like still really into

2011.38 --> 2015.0390000000002
nobility back I was I've been like kind

2013.96 --> 2018.039
of a

2015.039 --> 2020.46
but it's the idea of nobility right it's

2018.039 --> 2020.46
just like

2021.039 --> 2025.6
is this magical type of thinking that

2023.559 --> 2028.059
can work but it doesn't really work now

2025.6 --> 2029.74
in this age and if you look at give a

2028.059 --> 2034.44
leader enough love

2029.74 --> 2034.44
that he'll like do the right thing

2034.659 --> 2038.3200000000002
right

2035.74 --> 2040.6
now he's King now and he's totally

2038.32 --> 2041.62
[ __ ] up so

2040.6 --> 2043.899
yeah

2041.62 --> 2045.9399999999998
but anyway

2043.899 --> 2048.7599999999998
I didn't but just like meeting

2045.94 --> 2050.8
interesting figures

2048.76 --> 2051.8790000000004
it's hap it hasn't really happened that

2050.8 --> 2053.5800000000004
much

2051.879 --> 2056.5
but still

2053.58 --> 2058.44
and I've met some people probably that

2056.5 --> 2061.24
were like really

2058.44 --> 2064.06
notorious even now

2061.24 --> 2066.7799999999997
in the past that that I didn't really

2064.06 --> 2066.7799999999997
know back then

2067.839 --> 2072.48
you can meet the weirdest people at

2069.76 --> 2072.48
places like

2074.44 --> 2081.2200000000003
I bumped into some weird figures also at

2078.099 --> 2083.56
wave cough like traffic but I mean

2081.22 --> 2086.22
there's so much weird stuff going on

2083.56 --> 2090.48
there it's like

2086.22 --> 2090.48
you can't keep track of it all

2092.21 --> 2095.3
[Music]

2098.44 --> 2102.58
British people town

2101.02 --> 2105.7599999999998
yeah yeah

2102.58 --> 2108.7599999999998
that definitely helps

2105.76 --> 2111.3390000000004
I mean like my dad is more in the

2108.76 --> 2113.38
position like that right now because my

2111.339 --> 2116.98
mother-in-law

2113.38 --> 2119.1400000000003
like she does like deal with high class

2116.98 --> 2122.02
people a lot

2119.14 --> 2124.18
and she's very well deserved of that I

2122.02 --> 2127.14
mean she is like the classiest person

2124.18 --> 2127.14
that I've ever met

2127.3 --> 2131.7000000000003
it's incredible

2129.099 --> 2131.7000000000003
like

2131.8 --> 2137.04
it's foolproof like I've never seen her

2134.56 --> 2137.04
like

2137.26 --> 2141.3
be unladylike ever

2142.599 --> 2148.44
and I've seen her really frustrated I've

2145.119 --> 2148.44
seen her get pissed off but

2155.02 --> 2161.92
but yeah that also means that

2159.42 --> 2164.4
unexpected interesting people sometimes

2161.92 --> 2164.4
show up

2165.099 --> 2170.98
at their place for treatments like

2167.98 --> 2174.339
beauty treatments like wives of Mayors

2170.98 --> 2178.2
and wives of really

2174.339 --> 2178.2
big Bankers even in

2179.8 --> 2184.26
I think she may have met Bill Gates once

2184.3 --> 2189.04
Bill Gates wife I don't remember but I

2187.18 --> 2191.339
mean I wouldn't be surprised if they if

2189.04 --> 2191.339
they did

2191.859 --> 2196.0789999999997
like all kinds of people

2197.14 --> 2204.24
probably not Bill Gates himself

2199.72 --> 2204.24
probably not into like Beauty clinics

2218.619 --> 2223.92
hi and Chinese antique shop okay

2228.96 --> 2232.66
Thatcher's Manchester what does that

2231.28 --> 2235.5600000000004
mean Oz

2232.66 --> 2235.56
I don't know

2237.64 --> 2243.1189999999997
what this kind of powers does the king

2240.04 --> 2243.119
of the Netherlands will

2243.4 --> 2246.0
uh

2248.079 --> 2250.98
not a lot

2251.26 --> 2255.9
compared to like King of England

2259.119 --> 2266.32
Maggie yeah I know touch a thatcher is

2261.94 --> 2268.66
because I know who she is she was but I

2266.32 --> 2270.579
don't know what

2268.66 --> 2273.54
what that has to do with Manchester

2270.579 --> 2273.54
though

2278.64 --> 2283.0789999999997
I know who the Iron Lady is

2294.52 --> 2298.66
all right

2295.619 --> 2300.4
but uh

2298.66 --> 2304.5
yeah the king of the Netherlands is

2300.4 --> 2304.5
basically a a high-end

2304.66 --> 2310.48
like

2306.579 --> 2312.52
business really that's what it's become

2310.48 --> 2314.14
that's also a problematic because that

2312.52 --> 2316.9
yeah because of that they are like

2314.14 --> 2320.44
involved in like this freaking corporate

2316.9 --> 2322.78
conspiracy [ __ ] that's going down like

2320.44 --> 2325.3
they've become like fully invested and

2322.78 --> 2327.82
that's just horrendous

2325.3 --> 2332.44
I don't know how far it went actually

2327.82 --> 2335.38
though with like the actual nobility but

2332.44 --> 2337.9
they've they've gone like the full wef

2335.38 --> 2339.88
promoting that [ __ ]

2337.9 --> 2342.76
so

2339.88 --> 2344.8
and they're part of like the getting rid

2342.76 --> 2346.78
of the farmer's plan they're they're

2344.8 --> 2350.6400000000003
part of that so it's like it's it's

2346.78 --> 2350.6400000000003
pretty much as bad as it can get

2351.28 --> 2357.2200000000003
so I'm technically not really interested

2354.16 --> 2360.04
anymore in any powers that the king

2357.22 --> 2363.359
might have because he's [ __ ] up and

2360.04 --> 2363.359
evil and a Nazi

2367.06 --> 2372.119
he's part of that conspiracy that's

2369.22 --> 2372.1189999999997
happening right now

2375.28 --> 2378.76
I've said some harsher things in the

2377.68 --> 2380.859
past

2378.76 --> 2385.119
the more Angry mood

2380.859 --> 2387.22
and yeah I I do absolutely think he

2385.119 --> 2391.619
should be punished for that

2387.22 --> 2391.6189999999997
it's it's an unheard of treachery

2397.54 --> 2402.42
right

2398.98 --> 2402.42
so any other questions

2403.9 --> 2409.0
any of you got Magnus died do you know

2406.48 --> 2412.42
how to magnetize

2409.0 --> 2414.64
do you have Healing Hands anybody is

2412.42 --> 2416.7400000000002
this all just alien to you or is it like

2414.64 --> 2419.6189999999997
oh no that's only

2416.74 --> 2421.72
like gay people or priests or whatever

2419.619 --> 2425.92
do that like it I don't know what the

2421.72 --> 2428.3199999999997
[ __ ] you guys think of it I have no idea

2425.92 --> 2431.04
you're not exactly giving me a lot of

2428.32 --> 2431.04
feedback here

2436.359 --> 2441.339
steamy travel is really the only one

2438.22 --> 2442.66
that's giving any kind of feedback

2441.339 --> 2446.22
but

2442.66 --> 2446.22
in the form of a question

2462.0 --> 2467.74
I'm gonna just start showing down on my

2465.52 --> 2469.98
Illuminati Castle I'm freaking hungry

2467.74 --> 2469.9799999999996
anyway

2474.64 --> 2479.2599999999998
I mean I love doing my show but

2476.44 --> 2482.099
sometimes I really wish I had a

2479.26 --> 2482.099
different time slot

2482.38 --> 2486.94
a time slot where people would just be

2484.66 --> 2491.3999999999996
more engaging naturally

2486.94 --> 2491.4
and less time just trying to wake up

2492.16 --> 2497.52
um

2493.92 --> 2497.52
anyway cheers

2513.04 --> 2516.7799999999997
try a different time then

2519.46 --> 2524.04
it wouldn't be the early bird show then

2531.339 --> 2534.48
and besides

2535.78 --> 2541.8390000000004
this is also the time slot for me where

2540.16 --> 2544.7999999999997
I am the most

2541.839 --> 2544.7999999999997
top of my game

2545.02 --> 2550.92
where I'm the freshest

2548.02 --> 2550.92
the clearest

2554.8 --> 2558.78
and the least easily distracted

2560.8 --> 2566.579
ways early somewhere

2563.8 --> 2566.579
that's true

2584.079 --> 2589.02
lay on hands with that's different Oz

2590.38 --> 2596.26
I mean that's Hebrew Magic

2594.099 --> 2598.5
that's not what I do I don't speak any

2596.26 --> 2598.5
words

2601.42 --> 2607.359
it's I mean guys

2604.48 --> 2609.64
what I do right

2607.359 --> 2612.7
I basically just

2609.64 --> 2615.04
scan people with my hand like it's a

2612.7 --> 2617.5
tricorder and it's just like oh

2615.04 --> 2619.54
isn't this and this and this

2617.5 --> 2621.88
you feel that

2619.54 --> 2623.74
and then they're like oh yeah

2621.88 --> 2625.119
I'm like oh okay that's this and that

2623.74 --> 2630.2799999999997
you're

2625.119 --> 2633.04
it's like I am just a doctor from like

2630.28 --> 2635.6800000000003
out of the future 200 years I'm actually

2633.04 --> 2639.3
from Star Trek from the future and I

2635.68 --> 2643.06
like I don't use strike I just I am

2639.3 --> 2644.5
physically genetically built to be able

2643.06 --> 2647.4
to do that

2644.5 --> 2647.4
by God

2649.3 --> 2651.9
all right

2652.48 --> 2656.7400000000002
but I mean there is a limit though it's

2654.64 --> 2658.66
like I can't literally keep doing this

2656.74 --> 2660.9399999999996
all day long

2658.66 --> 2663.3999999999996
I'll run out I'll become really depleted

2660.94 --> 2666.839
it'll start to physically hurt in my

2663.4 --> 2666.839
muscles and in my joints

2684.579 --> 2691.48
but sometimes it works fantastic and

2688.48 --> 2695.28
then just to have the ability ready at

2691.48 --> 2695.28
hand literally at hand

2696.52 --> 2699.78
is a great blessing

2706.77 --> 2710.179
[Music]

2710.98 --> 2715.8
my ex was also quite pleased with my

2713.44 --> 2715.8
abilities

2722.2 --> 2727.54
and by the way even my mother when she

2724.839 --> 2730.24
was still alive used my services in that

2727.54 --> 2732.7599999999998
sense because she like

2730.24 --> 2735.04
payment moments of pain and tension and

2732.76 --> 2738.28
[ __ ]

2735.04 --> 2740.56
that you can't get rid of well that I am

2738.28 --> 2742.78
perfect for that

2740.56 --> 2745.2999999999997
I mean some

2742.78 --> 2748.1800000000003
guys like would give their girlfriend or

2745.3 --> 2749.8
something like a neck rub or a massage

2748.18 --> 2752.02
carefully

2749.8 --> 2754.619
like therapeutically not just for sex

2752.02 --> 2754.619
and all that

2755.079 --> 2759.4
and that would be really appreciated

2756.7 --> 2762.8999999999996
well guess what I can do that like

2759.4 --> 2762.9
Beyond professional

2763.06 --> 2767.98
because I can just I can also literally

2766.119 --> 2770.98
like just

2767.98 --> 2772.26
you it's like you just get like Electro

2770.98 --> 2774.94
problems

2772.26 --> 2775.98
just everything is like oh oh there's a

2774.94 --> 2779.38
problem

2775.98 --> 2782.38
it is like freaking I I am

2779.38 --> 2786.839
an amazing healer

2782.38 --> 2786.839
like very instantaneous

2792.579 --> 2800.5
can my magnetic it's yeah it's not yeah

2797.74 --> 2803.3999999999996
it's not a magnetic field like that it's

2800.5 --> 2803.4
just a field

2808.48 --> 2813.579
can it move

2811.0 --> 2815.74
immediately I've never actually tried

2813.579 --> 2818.28
that or maybe I have I don't know if

2815.74 --> 2818.2799999999997
that works

2818.859 --> 2822.5989999999997
what kind of thing can I heal

2823.18 --> 2830.2799999999997
pain

2825.099 --> 2830.28
mostly pain but also like sore muscle

2835.72 --> 2839.7
side effects of acute panic

2843.88 --> 2849.4
I can basically

2846.579 --> 2852.28
take away a strain

2849.4 --> 2855.2200000000003
that will obstruct healing

2852.28 --> 2857.38
healing time right so I can basically

2855.22 --> 2860.56
make wounds heal quicker too in that

2857.38 --> 2863.38
sense it's just a

2860.56 --> 2866.7599999999998
I'm I'm is result based I'm because what

2863.38 --> 2866.76
I actually do is like

2867.22 --> 2872.0789999999997
it's all Just Energy to me

2869.8 --> 2874.96
like everything is it's like the energy

2872.079 --> 2877.78
get the energies right

2874.96 --> 2880.599
everything is out of the way and then

2877.78 --> 2882.3390000000004
like if you if your spirit is just right

2880.599 --> 2884.8590000000004
and in the right place and everything is

2882.339 --> 2887.92
out of the way then the body will just

2884.859 --> 2890.98
heal as it always does Auto heal that's

2887.92 --> 2893.319
what the bodies do that's what life does

2890.98 --> 2895.54
and it will do so optimally

2893.319 --> 2899.04
and if there's [ __ ] in the way then it

2895.54 --> 2899.04
will not do so optimally

2905.8 --> 2911.7000000000003
sounds like BS okay well that's too bad

2908.98 --> 2911.7
for you man

2915.16 --> 2917.7
oh

2930.7 --> 2933.96
from Karate Kid

2935.14 --> 2940.0
that Karate Kid

2937.06 --> 2942.24
that is a typical healing lay on hands

2940.0 --> 2942.24
yes

2942.7 --> 2949.7999999999997
but I classify such techniques

2946.48 --> 2949.8
under Reiki

2956.44 --> 2962.079
because of the form it's you take energy

2958.78 --> 2965.079
from the outside from the universe

2962.079 --> 2967.0600000000004
and you let it flow into it so you

2965.079 --> 2969.7000000000003
it's like you take the free energy and

2967.06 --> 2972.5789999999997
you insert it that's Reiki

2969.7 --> 2976.6189999999997
magnetization is actually the opposite

2972.579 --> 2976.619
magnetization is extraction

2977.14 --> 2981.7599999999998
right that's what's happening I create

2979.72 --> 2984.22
this tension I feel this stuff and then

2981.76 --> 2988.2400000000002
I absorb it

2984.22 --> 2991.1189999999997
goes away there and re-enters here

2988.24 --> 2992.5
that's magnetization so that's yeah you

2991.119 --> 2995.319
can have like a

2992.5 --> 2998.14
cultural background for what you're

2995.319 --> 3000.839
doing I'm actually studying the

2998.14 --> 3005.0
mechanical processes and naming the

3000.839 --> 3005.0
effects by their mechanical process

3007.14 --> 3011.46
so inserting energy for me is classified

3010.079 --> 3014.9
Reiki

3011.46 --> 3014.9
and extracting energy

3014.94 --> 3019.859
space magnetization I'm a specialist

3018.119 --> 3022.88
magnetization there's not a lot of

3019.859 --> 3022.88
people that are good at that

3023.04 --> 3028.98
most people just fear pain because they

3026.64 --> 3032.72
go no not more pain they don't

3028.98 --> 3032.72
understand the nature of pain at all

3033.66 --> 3039.7799999999997
pain is actually a valuable commodity to

3037.74 --> 3042.4399999999996
a certain extent as long as you can

3039.78 --> 3042.44
control it

3047.339 --> 3050.54
but people don't

3051.24 --> 3057.2999999999997
have been taught all their lives and

3054.42 --> 3058.8
culturally to fear pain that pain is

3057.3 --> 3060.6600000000003
always just

3058.8 --> 3062.7000000000003
something to be avoided

[Music]

3062.7 --> 3067.0989999999997
you don't get anywhere that way do you

3068.099 --> 3070.099
um

3079.8 --> 3084.059
you didn't feel anything

3081.96 --> 3087.619
okay interesting slow mo moon buggy but

3084.059 --> 3087.619
yeah if you're really depleted

3089.28 --> 3094.7400000000002
then yeah you might simply not have the

3092.46 --> 3096.3
sensory this your senses that would

3094.74 --> 3097.859
normally pick up on that would have been

3096.3 --> 3099.54
deactivated

3097.859 --> 3101.64
right

3099.54 --> 3102.839
if you're like really broken and stuck

3101.64 --> 3104.8799999999997
in a way

3102.839 --> 3106.74
somebody can do that on you and then you

3104.88 --> 3108.3
won't feel it but you will feel the

3106.74 --> 3110.7599999999998
result of it later

3108.3 --> 3112.8
you will certainly like step out of it

3110.76 --> 3115.26
all of a sudden

3112.8 --> 3119.88
right well if you're just like weakened

3115.26 --> 3121.44
and not broken then you will like feel

3119.88 --> 3124.6800000000003
up like that and just immediately

3121.44 --> 3127.14
function again but if you're broken

3124.68 --> 3129.0
your senses simply aren't there to pick

3127.14 --> 3131.94
up on anything and then so it doesn't

3129.0 --> 3133.94
work instantaneous

3131.94 --> 3133.94
um

3135.54 --> 3138.02

mother in the world that's gonna

3186.48 --> 3191.28
actually say change the name of their

account

3191.28 --> 3197.76
to Mom of the nickname online there's no

3197.76 --> 3202.1600000000003
that would ever do that you're a troll

3295.92 --> 3301.44
like why would you not let your kid

3299.7 --> 3302.8799999999997
just continue what they're doing and

3301.44 --> 3305.52
just tell them hey

3302.88 --> 3308.28
just don't send anybody money

3305.52 --> 3312.14
why the [ __ ] would you like not let him

3308.28 --> 3312.1400000000003

3315.059 --> 3320.3
he didn't actually even do any damage he

3317.64 --> 3320.2999999999997
never sent it

3323.52 --> 3328.2
but you're really gonna create a YouTube

3326.099 --> 3329.52
account you even know how to do that

3328.2 --> 3333.2599999999998
apparently

3329.52 --> 3333.2599999999998
not very typical mother

3333.54 --> 3337.22
just so you can show up

like that why didn't you just

3342.54 --> 3349.88
use your kids account like none of this

3345.48 --> 3349.88
makes any freaking sense you're a troll

acting guilds just to try to fool me

3386.819 --> 3391.5589999999997

3388.859 --> 3393.48

3489.119 --> 3492.079
yeah anyway

3508.5 --> 3511.04
what

3517.5 --> 3520.7
yeah magnetism

3520.859 --> 3523.7599999999998
what it is

3523.98 --> 3531.7400000000002
magnetism is technically a field

3527.76 --> 3531.7400000000002
and within the field there's like a

3533.099 --> 3536.059
polarized effect

3545.579 --> 3553.2000000000003
and so something can be attracted or

3549.0 --> 3556.64
repelled depending on its polarization

3553.2 --> 3556.64
in relation to the field

3593.76 --> 3598.7990000000004
we're having a tough day

3596.64 --> 3601.74
are things a bit slow and why are things

3598.799 --> 3603.96
so slow I mean I feel great

3601.74 --> 3606.3799999999997
I got energy I'd love to talk about

3603.96 --> 3606.38
stuff

3607.68 --> 3611.22
I'm all charged up for my day off

3609.96 --> 3613.859
yesterday

3611.22 --> 3616.4399999999996
did you all like break down from me not

3613.859 --> 3618.18
being there one day

3616.44 --> 3620.04
come on

3618.18 --> 3621.359
or is it just something in the weather

3620.04 --> 3624.18
right now

3621.359 --> 3627.5589999999997
because weather here is just fine

3624.18 --> 3627.5589999999997
well it's a bit windy

3630.48 --> 3635.52
but I mean there's just this amazing

3632.339 --> 3637.319
patches of blue sky

3635.52 --> 3640.7599999999998
look at that

3637.319 --> 3640.7599999999998
how blue that is

3645.0 --> 3647.96
cloud in the air

3652.2 --> 3656.8999999999996
in the meantime there's a bit of sun

3662.059 --> 3667.6400000000003
and a bit of drilling in the wall oh

3665.099 --> 3667.6400000000003
goody

3677.28 --> 3682.46
have I ever gone up in a hot air balloon

3683.88 --> 3687.079
I'm not sure

3690.24 --> 3693.68
I'm really not sure

3694.079 --> 3699.599
I think not I think I actually haven't

3696.9 --> 3701.7000000000003
but weirdly enough I think I did

3699.599 --> 3704.46
actually through a dark World Experience

3701.7 --> 3706.859
did experience like my grandmother going

3704.46 --> 3709.079
up in a because my grandmother added

3706.859 --> 3713.18
like for a weird present a birthday

3709.079 --> 3713.1800000000003
present at some point I think

3716.339 --> 3724.0789999999997
and I think I experienced that from her

3719.88 --> 3726.6600000000003
like through her eyes in the Dark World

3724.079 --> 3728.7000000000003
so I do have like recollection of what

3726.66 --> 3732.3799999999997
it's like it's just that I haven't

3728.7 --> 3732.3799999999997
actually experienced it physically

3734.46 --> 3738.02
been on a hovercraft cool

3745.2 --> 3749.24
I think you would remember if you did

3746.88 --> 3749.2400000000002
yeah

3755.339 --> 3760.14
the thing is that I do have memories of

3758.22 --> 3761.9399999999996
a lot of things including things that I

3760.14 --> 3763.859
haven't actually done that I can pretty

3761.94 --> 3765.48
much figure out that I haven't done I

3763.859 --> 3766.5789999999997
still have memories of what it's like

3765.48 --> 3771.5
though

3766.579 --> 3771.5
yeah that's freaking dark world for you

3772.02 --> 3775.339
it's interesting though but

3778.92 --> 3784.799
like a low flying hot air balloon

3782.16 --> 3789.319
you mean like a flying carpet it's

3784.799 --> 3789.319
basically a mechanized flying carpet

3790.319 --> 3792.5
foreign

3799.7 --> 3805.64
I'm pretty sure that I have been on a

3802.26 --> 3808.559
hovercraft like a really basic one

3805.64 --> 3810.0589999999997
or otherwise it [ __ ] it otherwise I

3808.559 --> 3812.8190000000004
freaking experienced that in a dark

3810.059 --> 3817.44
world too I don't even know man

3812.819 --> 3820.5
I mean when I was a teenager I did like

3817.44 --> 3822.799
get around and experience all kinds of

3820.5 --> 3822.799
stuff

3826.26 --> 3831.6600000000003
just like bump into people I didn't know

3828.54 --> 3833.94
and then just go with them

3831.66 --> 3835.68
it's like hey if if family is it looks

3833.94 --> 3838.38
kind of nice

3835.68 --> 3841.2799999999997
can I hang out with you guys let's say

3838.38 --> 3841.28
yeah sure why not

3842.119 --> 3846.619
like on vacations and stuff

3872.22 --> 3879.66
quite a tiny submarine criminal okay

3876.78 --> 3882.38
creepy yeah I definitely haven't gone in

3879.66 --> 3882.3799999999997
a submarine

3883.02 --> 3887.339
I don't think I'd like it there

3885.359 --> 3890.339
like

3887.339 --> 3893.46
I have just very slight but it's still

3890.339 --> 3897.5
there slight claustrophobia it's

3893.46 --> 3897.5
thank God it's not really that bad

3898.68 --> 3903.5989999999997
but I mean if I like I've had times

3901.5 --> 3905.28
where I'm like in a cave and it felt

3903.599 --> 3908.76
like I was stuck

3905.28 --> 3911.28
that is a [ __ ] nightmare guys you're

3908.76 --> 3913.7990000000004
like that is so terrifying you can't

3911.28 --> 3916.38
imagine

3913.799 --> 3918.48
like you're in a cave you're trying to

3916.38 --> 3921.299
crawl through a hole

3918.48 --> 3925.04
and then you get stuck this there it's

3921.299 --> 3925.04
unbelievably terrifying

3925.339 --> 3931.5789999999997
ah

3927.24 --> 3931.5789999999997
submarine no

3932.599 --> 3938.599
it's just no let's not do that

3943.079 --> 3948.6600000000003
I'm not a spelunker no I no but that's

3946.02 --> 3952.14
not true though I well

3948.66 --> 3954.5
if it's really tight ass K oh God no no

3952.14 --> 3954.5
no no

3955.52 --> 3961.14
I mean I love caves I think caves are

3958.92 --> 3962.7000000000003
[ __ ] epic and awesome and fascinating

3961.14 --> 3966.0589999999997
and beautiful

3962.7 --> 3968.04
I just really don't like really tiny

3966.059 --> 3970.38
spaces that you might have to go through

3968.04 --> 3972.359
and where you could get stuck that

3970.38 --> 3975.299
that's just it

3972.359 --> 3978.68
it's all it's really a fear of crawling

3975.299 --> 3978.68
in something and getting stuck

3980.28 --> 3986.2200000000003
it's weird maybe this is like a feline

3983.04 --> 3988.619
fear because I mean a lot of cats in in

3986.22 --> 3990.8999999999996
the in the wild probably die that way

3988.619 --> 3993.7400000000002
that try to crawl through something and

3990.9 --> 3993.7400000000002
then they get stuck

4003.92 --> 4007.539
and then they just starve

4018.44 --> 4023.839
no but anyway yeah I'm not super

4021.319 --> 4025.099
claustrophobic but I hate like getting

4023.839 --> 4028.72
stuck

4025.099 --> 4028.7200000000003
in a very tight space

4043.819 --> 4048.5
but the the factor with it also is is

4047.059 --> 4052.099
that

4048.5 --> 4054.5
like it would be a nature like

4052.099 --> 4056.9
getting stuck in a place in the middle

4054.5 --> 4060.76
of nowhere right that's that's the real

4056.9 --> 4060.76
factor it's the factor that

4062.359 --> 4067.7
like you get stuck and then you like

4065.96 --> 4069.44
nobody can help you and you can't get

4067.7 --> 4071.8999999999996
help like that

4069.44 --> 4073.94
that is part of that day I think because

4071.9 --> 4077.359
if I like get stuck

4073.94 --> 4080.119
like somewhere in a house or whatever or

4077.359 --> 4081.859
stuck in a bush like that does not scare

4080.119 --> 4084.38
me the slightest

4081.859 --> 4088.5789999999997
at all

4084.38 --> 4091.4
it's really like caves like a way where

4088.579 --> 4093.92
nobody goes right

4091.4 --> 4095.839
and then you get curious and then you

4093.92 --> 4098.96
like Risk something really stupid and

4095.839 --> 4102.219
you get stuck and now you're [ __ ]

4098.96 --> 4102.219
genuinely [ __ ]

4102.819 --> 4106.839000000001
I forget lost as a child

4110.319 --> 4118.1
yeah it did I think it did happen

4115.52 --> 4120.5
like one time

4118.1 --> 4123.859
where I just started like wandering I I

4120.5 --> 4126.739
started basically like I'm gonna explore

4123.859 --> 4130.6990000000005
but like I just like went on and on and

4126.739 --> 4133.639999999999
I had no idea where I was eventually

4130.699 --> 4137.48
I did not have any like developed sense

4133.64 --> 4139.64
of mapping of everything so I had no I

4137.48 --> 4141.5599999999995
had no orientation at all I was very

4139.64 --> 4143.6
little I think it was like eight or

4141.56 --> 4146.2390000000005
something I did that one time and it

4143.6 --> 4149.4800000000005
didn't even like mean to run away I was

4146.239 --> 4152.599999999999
just like yeah I'm exploring this is

4149.48 --> 4155.299
huh and then they got lost and then

4152.6 --> 4157.4800000000005
eventually like somebody spotted me and

4155.299 --> 4157.48
then

4167.12 --> 4173.66
it's like somebody spotted me that my

4170.54 --> 4175.64
parents knew me and then they called my

4173.66 --> 4178.16
parents and then they immediately came

4175.64 --> 4181.839
and get me

4178.16 --> 4181.839
I remember that happening one time

4182.719 --> 4186.62
but I was just like really innocently

4184.64 --> 4190.64
like I'm just looking around it's so

4186.62 --> 4192.739
fast like I'm having an adventure Mommy

4190.64 --> 4195.860000000001
uh

4192.739 --> 4198.099999999999
and then yeah that's the last time I did

4195.86 --> 4198.099999999999
that

4207.92 --> 4216.5
you're not a cave guy at Oz right

4211.76 --> 4219.5
well I I do kind of like caves I just

4216.5 --> 4222.199
really don't like to get stuck in caves

4219.5 --> 4224.239
I don't like tight crawl spaces like

4222.199 --> 4227.78
that

4224.239 --> 4230.36
in caves that's what I [ __ ] hate like

4227.78 --> 4233.179
that's where the point where I get like

4230.36 --> 4235.599999999999
can't we just like

4233.179 --> 4235.6
like

4235.88 --> 4243.08
dig the tunnel or like I don't know

4239.38 --> 4245.84
blow a chip off it so that it's just

4243.08 --> 4247.1
like a normal crawl space where you

4245.84 --> 4248.2390000000005
can't get stuck

4247.1 --> 4250.46
like

4248.239 --> 4252.678999999999
I am very much like that to have that

4250.46 --> 4254.06
tendency like can't we just like

4252.679 --> 4257.2
make that

4254.06 --> 4260.279
like engineer that it's more passable

4257.2 --> 4260.2789999999995
[Music]

4260.6 --> 4267.280000000001
now of course it's a spelunker yeah

4263.54 --> 4267.28
you're not gonna do that with a pick

4269.96 --> 4275.6
but I like caves but I don't like it

4272.179 --> 4278.2390000000005
when they're like not really accessible

4275.6 --> 4282.38
but even as a kid like I was fascinated

4278.239 --> 4286.879999999999
with gems and crystals and

4282.38 --> 4289.159000000001
and my mother a couple of times took me

4286.88 --> 4292.28
again the family to like Belgium in

4289.159 --> 4294.0199999999995
Belgium there's like these caves that

4292.28 --> 4296.42
they are like tourist attractions and

4294.02 --> 4298.580000000001
there's like all this kind of uh what

4296.42 --> 4300.86
you call that stalagmite static type

4298.58 --> 4303.44
stuff everywhere

4300.86 --> 4304.82
I love that I mean that was that was

4303.44 --> 4308.0
awesome

4304.82 --> 4311.199
I do like caves I just don't like

4308.0 --> 4311.199
getting stuck in them

4317.42 --> 4324.38
maybe it's my ancestral caveman

4321.08 --> 4326.9
instincts maybe in a previous life I was

4324.38 --> 4330.679
a caveman that's why I love it so much

4326.9 --> 4332.42
but I got stuck and then I died

4330.679 --> 4335.42
might have happened a couple of times

4332.42 --> 4335.42
Maybe

4336.56 --> 4339.88
if you think of it like that

4343.1 --> 4348.1990000000005
I'm talking slightly sarcastically but I

4346.159 --> 4351.62
mean I I don't really have an objection

4348.199 --> 4353.719
into that reasoning

4351.62 --> 4356.179
against that reason

4353.719 --> 4359.679
anyway

4356.179 --> 4359.679
man time is flying

4360.739 --> 4366.94
hope you guys are enjoying the show you

4363.02 --> 4366.9400000000005
don't seem to be super chatty but

4367.34 --> 4370.360000000001
that's all fine

4374.78 --> 4378.04
I need to dig into this

4378.56 --> 4381.159000000001
all right

4392.84 --> 4395.5
hmm

4407.31 --> 4410.499000000001
[Music]

4411.5 --> 4415.699
no but one of the reasons why I also

4414.56 --> 4419.3
like

4415.699 --> 4422.48
the idea of caves is because

4419.3 --> 4424.64
I just have a fantasy always had as a

4422.48 --> 4427.28
kid like that you would go into a cave

4424.64 --> 4428.719
and then go to a place where nobody's

4427.28 --> 4431.48
went

4428.719 --> 4434.42
and like find crystals

4431.48 --> 4436.759999999999
find the crystals in the in the wall

4434.42 --> 4441.04
somewhere it's like it's a fantasy I

4436.76 --> 4441.04
know that doesn't usually work like that

4447.56 --> 4452.96
but for a long time as a little kid it

4450.14 --> 4455.719
was a big fantasy of mine to just like

4452.96 --> 4457.82
cave Explorer and then find like giant

4455.719 --> 4459.38
crystal

4457.82 --> 4462.46
places

4459.38 --> 4462.46
Crystal pockets

4463.52 --> 4467.84
I wanted to be the guy that stumbled

4465.62 --> 4470.199
upon like a giant Crystal Cave remember

4467.84 --> 4470.1990000000005
that

4490.46 --> 4495.26
never seen the Crystal Cave mix well I

4493.34 --> 4497.360000000001
have not seen it with my own eyes I've

4495.26 --> 4500.0
never been to Mexico but I've definitely

4497.36 --> 4502.4
seen the photographs and at first I

4500.0 --> 4505.179
thought like this is Photoshop

4502.4 --> 4509.96
these guys are obviously

4505.179 --> 4513.26
like photoshopped into like a

4509.96 --> 4514.699
just like a collage with a lot of

4513.26 --> 4516.860000000001
crystals

4514.699 --> 4520.46
but then it started to shine to me like

4516.86 --> 4524.719
no no they're actually there it really

4520.46 --> 4527.54
is that insanely large this is crazy

4524.719 --> 4529.1
yeah I've seen the Crystal Cave it's

4527.54 --> 4532.04
astounding

4529.1 --> 4534.620000000001
I really hope they've mostly kept it

4532.04 --> 4536.3
intact would be quite a shame if they'd

4534.62 --> 4538.76
if they Disturbed it

4536.3 --> 4540.1990000000005
there's probably some really old Spirits

4538.76 --> 4543.76
hanging there

4540.199 --> 4543.759999999999
that should not be disturbed

[Music]

4554.679 --> 4560.08
hello EB 23

4562.34 --> 4566.1990000000005
.

4563.6 --> 4566.1990000000005
oh

4567.86 --> 4570.58
what

4573.02 --> 4580.52
what the hell are you talking about us

4577.76 --> 4582.820000000001
you've been boiled to death where

4580.52 --> 4582.820000000001
what

4591.62 --> 4596.78
yeah good picture

4594.5 --> 4600.679
but seriously when I first saw that it's

4596.78 --> 4603.759999999999
like that's Photoshop come on

4600.679 --> 4607.659
like seriously you really that that's

4603.76 --> 4607.659000000001
obviously just this big

4608.38 --> 4614.54
but no it's really that crazy

4611.78 --> 4619.36
the funny thing though is is that

4614.54 --> 4619.36
you could Photoshop this

4620.42 --> 4623.56
it's just real

4634.76 --> 4636.76
um

4636.92 --> 4641.92
right but that sort of photoshopping has

4639.08 --> 4645.38
probably done with some pictures of

4641.92 --> 4647.2390000000005
giants like giant bones right I think

4645.38 --> 4648.32
that a lot of them have actually been

4647.239 --> 4650.718999999999
faked

4648.32 --> 4653.239
those pictures

4650.719 --> 4655.699
I still genuinely believe that there

4653.239 --> 4658.218999999999
have been Giants really a lot

4655.699 --> 4660.44
especially in America with the red hair

4658.219 --> 4662.659
and all that that's there

4660.44 --> 4665.599999999999
but there are pictures going around in

4662.659 --> 4668.42
which there has been photoshopping like

4665.6 --> 4671.0
it's not the scale

4668.42 --> 4674.12
you can see like a weird scale even like

4671.0 --> 4676.94
a resolution mismatch almost in dollars

4674.12 --> 4679.0599999999995
and those pictures also went around a

4676.94 --> 4679.0599999999995
lot

4679.76 --> 4682.46
internet

4681.32 --> 4684.08
actually

4682.46 --> 4685.94
well it's probably been there for a

4684.08 --> 4687.5
while

4685.94 --> 4690.08
but I bumped into that sort of thing

4687.5 --> 4691.88
when I got into like more my giant

4690.08 --> 4693.86
theories

4691.88 --> 4697.1
like

4693.86 --> 4700.719
after 2016 and then eventually no trees

4697.1 --> 4700.719
on Flat Earth came and all that

4708.8 --> 4712.06

4845.42 --> 4848.08
what

4850.1 --> 4855.4400000000005
no you can't prove two things that

4853.46 --> 4858.28
obviously contradict each other and

4855.44 --> 4858.28
negate each other

4865.04 --> 4869.3
it can't move into different directions

4867.44 --> 4872.299999999999
at the same time

4869.3 --> 4872.3
but

4872.48 --> 4876.099999999999
a separated medium

4876.14 --> 4880.64
something that is within it as it is

4878.179 --> 4882.88
moving then things within that closed

4880.64 --> 4887.3
medium can move around

4882.88 --> 4892.3
depending on yeah the uh the this

4887.3 --> 4892.3
distribution of forces due to motion

4895.699 --> 4899.44
why is the sky blue

4902.42 --> 4908.96
hello Nathan r

4904.46 --> 4908.96
yeah why is it blue uh

4909.739 --> 4914.599999999999
I don't know but one thing is for sure

4912.62 --> 4920.599999999999
and that is that

4914.6 --> 4924.26
that blue is not the blue of water yeah

4920.6 --> 4925.9400000000005
there's no water that looks like that

4924.26 --> 4928.1
like that blue

4925.94 --> 4930.879999999999
there's no water that can be made to

4928.1 --> 4930.88
look like that yeah

4931.04 --> 4934.0
I mean

4934.4 --> 4940.58
the closest you could possibly get is

4937.159 --> 4942.5599999999995
like uh in tropical areas

4940.58 --> 4945.5599999999995
where there's like really shallow water

4942.56 --> 4948.14
and it's really warm

4945.56 --> 4951.080000000001
like the real like where you have coral

4948.14 --> 4954.5
reefs and stuff that's where the water

4951.08 --> 4958.1
can sort of almost become that kind of

4954.5 --> 4961.1
blue but everywhere else it's never like

4958.1 --> 4965.26
that water is just green

4961.1 --> 4965.26
most of the time because of the salt

4967.1 --> 4971.84
why is the sky blue

4969.32 --> 4975.08
a great mystery it's certainly not

4971.84 --> 4976.64
because of water because water

4975.08 --> 4979.159
a lot of it

4976.64 --> 4980.96
doesn't look like that blue it never

4979.159 --> 4984.679
does yeah when you go to a swimming pool

4980.96 --> 4987.199
and look oh I look so blue amazing yeah

4984.679 --> 4990.92
you know why because they put blue

4987.199 --> 4993.919999999999
tiling in everywhere that's why it looks

4990.92 --> 4996.4
so blue because water doesn't look blue

4993.92 --> 4996.4
like that

4996.56 --> 4998.9800000000005
oh

5002.5 --> 5008.679
this guy cannot be seen right

5005.8 --> 5011.7390000000005
where you can see a blue there but it's

5008.679 --> 5014.219
not the sky itself or well it might be

5011.739 --> 5014.218999999999
partially

5020.679 --> 5026.08
I don't know why it looks blue why does

5023.199 --> 5031.199
it look blue and why when you go up

5026.08 --> 5031.199
really really high you see black instead

5038.8 --> 5044.7390000000005
so yeah the blue May simply be an effect

5041.8 --> 5048.28
of like just the preponderance of the

5044.739 --> 5050.86
gas so it like slight refraction

5048.28 --> 5052.719
like because of the material like a sort

5050.86 --> 5055.48
of scattering type is that really

5052.719 --> 5058.2390000000005
scattered yeah maybe that is it

5055.48 --> 5060.879999999999
just the slight scattering through the

5058.239 --> 5064.0599999999995
medium is causing I mean when you look

5060.88 --> 5066.46
through a water medium you also have

5064.06 --> 5071.820000000001
that sort of effect

5066.46 --> 5071.82
you everything gets colored around you

5072.58 --> 5077.38
it's because of the same effect so

5075.699 --> 5080.94
it's not like

5077.38 --> 5080.9400000000005
we're looking at water

5083.38 --> 5088.6
because when you look at water it's not

5085.42 --> 5092.62
blue but in water

5088.6 --> 5096.280000000001
it it might seem a little bluish

5092.62 --> 5099.219
if there's enough sun shining in it

5096.28 --> 5101.139999999999
but I mean it doesn't look like that so

5099.219 --> 5102.76
I think that this is just like that's

5101.14 --> 5105.88
what

5102.76 --> 5107.9800000000005
looking through the air looks like it's

5105.88 --> 5109.659000000001
like looking through air gives you that

5107.98 --> 5112.299999999999
blue

5109.659 --> 5114.879999999999
so it is like the lighting up of the air

5112.3 --> 5116.4400000000005
basically a large preponderance of it

5114.88 --> 5119.32
because a little bit of air is like

5116.44 --> 5122.98
literally transparent but when it's this

5119.32 --> 5125.799999999999
much I guess it looks blue when you have

5122.98 --> 5129.54
light shining through it

5125.8 --> 5129.54
that's how I would describe it

5135.1 --> 5140.38
this guy is never blue in Manchester I

5137.86 --> 5143.08
wouldn't know I've never been there

5140.38 --> 5144.76
but uh yeah it certainly blue over here

5143.08 --> 5148.179
look at that

5144.76 --> 5151.02
come on give me that contrast come on

5148.179 --> 5151.02
do it

5152.159 --> 5155.4
yes yes yes

5155.86 --> 5158.5199999999995
that is

5161.25 --> 5164.46
[Music]

5175.239 --> 5178.379999999999
right but

5179.62 --> 5185.08
so yeah that's what I think I think it's

5183.159 --> 5187.32
just what happens when you look through

5185.08 --> 5187.32
air

5197.08 --> 5201.36
right and if there's more moist in the

5199.239 --> 5201.36
air

5202.48 --> 5207.419999999999
well then it probably becomes more

5205.0 --> 5207.42
grayish

5241.32 --> 5248.259999999999
it's a luminiferous ether exciting the

5245.5 --> 5250.719
gas well yeah or it's just the Sun

5248.26 --> 5251.679
it's just scattering from the sun it's

5250.719 --> 5254.62
just

5251.679 --> 5257.679
yeah this is the color

5254.62 --> 5260.159
of the air when you look through enough

5257.679 --> 5260.159
of it

5267.82 --> 5271.36
it's also kind of interesting to

5269.739 --> 5273.459999999999
consider like

5271.36 --> 5275.799999999999
could you

5273.46 --> 5277.2390000000005
prove that that it is blue like could

5275.8 --> 5280.0
you

5277.239 --> 5281.739
just like scale down the volume through

5280.0 --> 5283.42
which you're looking but then compress

5281.739 --> 5287.4
the gas

5283.42 --> 5287.4
to be like an equal amount

5287.8 --> 5292.84
but uh yeah

5289.3 --> 5296.8
but within a smaller confine

5292.84 --> 5299.28
would it then seem blue

5296.8 --> 5299.28
right

5299.62 --> 5306.239
it's like how much can you compress gas

5301.9 --> 5306.239
before it starts to liquefy

5306.28 --> 5311.8
and can you do it in a transparent

5308.44 --> 5314.44
container so you could actually like

5311.8 --> 5317.62
look through it at its most compressed

5314.44 --> 5319.0599999999995
state will it seem a little bit more

5317.62 --> 5321.219
bluish

5319.06 --> 5324.06
that's an interesting thing to figure

5321.219 --> 5324.06
out isn't it

5325.139 --> 5332.1990000000005
shorter wavelength

5329.02 --> 5334.2390000000005
[ __ ] is a wave what wavelength

5332.199 --> 5337.138999999999
here we go again with the wave nonsense

5334.239 --> 5337.138999999999
there is no wave

5343.239 --> 5346.678999999999
light is not a wave

5359.92 --> 5365.189
foreign

5362.09 --> 5365.189
[Music]

5372.4 --> 5378.179
I know you're joking but I mean

5374.98 --> 5378.178999999999
demonstrate it then

5378.219 --> 5383.38
yeah make a little Crystal dough

5381.28 --> 5385.0
I have a little camera at the middle of

5383.38 --> 5386.86
it and just like oh let's look around

5385.0 --> 5389.26
what does this look like oh yeah it's

5386.86 --> 5391.659
almost like the blue sky well okay now

5389.26 --> 5393.639
you got a case just like yeah

5391.659 --> 5396.28
I've got a mini design for a crystal

5393.639 --> 5399.28
Dome and it yeah that might be

5396.28 --> 5402.219
what's causing everything to look so

5399.28 --> 5404.699
blue when it's all clear sky

5402.219 --> 5404.699
right

5405.28 --> 5409.42
but I doubt you could achieve something

5407.139 --> 5411.9400000000005
because that's not

5409.42 --> 5413.08
it's not blue because of what's in the

5411.94 --> 5414.879999999999
background

5413.08 --> 5416.5599999999995
it's blue because of what you're looking

5414.88 --> 5419.56
through

5416.56 --> 5419.56
foreign

5422.34 --> 5427.08
length just a measure of frequency yes

5428.32 --> 5435.58
but it has to do with color also color

5432.28 --> 5438.699
is like this is a spectrum and it's

5435.58 --> 5440.92
attributed to wavelength

5438.699 --> 5443.44
but this is [ __ ] horseshit it's

5440.92 --> 5445.54
conceptual

5443.44 --> 5448.0
because there is no Wave light is in the

5445.54 --> 5450.34
wave it doesn't have a wavelength it it

5448.0 --> 5452.38
just has a

5450.34 --> 5454.4800000000005
frequency

5452.38 --> 5456.9400000000005
although yeah I don't know another word

5454.48 --> 5459.12
for it it has a spectrum but it isn't a

5456.94 --> 5459.12
wave

5469.32 --> 5475.38
I mean no wonder light is so freaking

5472.239 --> 5475.379999999999
complicated to Define

5475.719 --> 5479.38
and then you start calling everything

5476.98 --> 5482.259999999999
ways it's because of the spectrum it's

5479.38 --> 5484.56
because light has a spectrum

5482.26 --> 5487.84
and they don't know how to justify that

5484.56 --> 5490.780000000001
if it wasn't a wave and that's why they

5487.84 --> 5493.06
called everything about it a wave

5490.78 --> 5495.639
even though it isn't it's provably not a

5493.06 --> 5498.159000000001
wave it's a particle according to actual

5495.639 --> 5501.159000000001
physics but they still call it a wave

5498.159 --> 5503.739
because they don't know how to deal with

5501.159 --> 5506.259999999999
the freaking Spectrum

5503.739 --> 5508.9
they don't know what to do with it like

5506.26 --> 5511.900000000001
even if it's suspective how couldn't it

5508.9 --> 5515.08
be a wave yeah and that's what's led to

5511.9 --> 5518.04
this setup that we're all dealing with

5515.08 --> 5518.04
that's what I think

5520.48 --> 5525.759999999999
yeah you could say like

5523.54 --> 5527.5
definitely does have a spectrum there's

5525.76 --> 5530.320000000001
different types of light

5527.5 --> 5533.38
it doesn't have to do with the speed

5530.32 --> 5536.5199999999995
yeah it's not actually speeding up

5533.38 --> 5536.52
or slowing down

5536.56 --> 5543.820000000001
and

5539.08 --> 5546.34
there is an influence unlike like for

5543.82 --> 5548.5
some reason certain types of light when

5546.34 --> 5551.4400000000005
you move toward it

5548.5 --> 5554.98
it slightly changes its color so that

5551.44 --> 5557.199
would all suggest right all of it like

5554.98 --> 5561.638999999999
even You could argue empirically

5557.199 --> 5563.678999999999
suggests that there is a speed

5561.639 --> 5565.78
and that would change and the change of

5563.679 --> 5568.0
the speed would change the color

5565.78 --> 5571.96
so that the color would be related to

5568.0 --> 5575.56
speed the issue though is there is no

5571.96 --> 5575.56
speed yeah

5575.86 --> 5583.299999999999
so any speed effect is what something

5579.82 --> 5585.159
else is doing it might oddly influence

5583.3 --> 5588.3
the colors

5585.159 --> 5591.28
but the light itself

5588.3 --> 5594.88
doesn't have his feet

5591.28 --> 5596.98
so if something else has a speed that

5594.88 --> 5598.36
might have an influence on how light

5596.98 --> 5601.9
basically

5598.36 --> 5604.0599999999995
how the color is when it arrives how it

5601.9 --> 5605.739
is perceived

5604.06 --> 5608.02
but

5605.739 --> 5610.78
correlation is not causation people

5608.02 --> 5612.280000000001
think that oh well

5610.78 --> 5615.28
if

5612.28 --> 5617.199
there's motion between the Observer and

5615.28 --> 5619.0
the light and that changes the color of

5617.199 --> 5621.638999999999
the light well that means that it has to

5619.0 --> 5625.719
do with the speed the speed has changed

5621.639 --> 5628.2390000000005
and from a relative perspective well

5625.719 --> 5630.639
that means that light has a speed and if

5628.239 --> 5631.839999999999
you change it slightly that it changes

5630.639 --> 5634.36
the color

5631.84 --> 5637.42
so it's all implied

5634.36 --> 5639.4
that blight has a speed and thereby oh

5637.42 --> 5641.1990000000005
it's we just we're going to justify it

5639.4 --> 5643.42
by calling it a wave

5641.199 --> 5645.699
because we can because it has to have a

5643.42 --> 5648.46
speed because we're inferring that even

5645.699 --> 5650.199
though we can't actually prove that

5648.46 --> 5653.44
light has a speed

5650.199 --> 5655.799999999999
see how enormous this cluster [ __ ] has

5653.44 --> 5655.799999999999
become

5656.44 --> 5660.5199999999995
and this has been out there for like 80

5658.36 --> 5663.46
years

5660.52 --> 5665.860000000001
it's like this intangible situation

5663.46 --> 5668.7390000000005
concerning

5665.86 --> 5673.839999999999
the analysis and conception of light

5668.739 --> 5675.94
like people don't the physicists even

5673.84 --> 5680.26
like they're all stuck in their own

5675.94 --> 5683.08
mechanisms within it like nobody knows

5680.26 --> 5685.0
like how to deal with light

5683.08 --> 5686.98
how long does it have to take before

5685.0 --> 5689.38
people figure out within the physics

5686.98 --> 5691.0
community that the model for light that

5689.38 --> 5692.7390000000005
has been given and

5691.0 --> 5694.659
put together

5692.739 --> 5697.48
including by some of their own

5694.659 --> 5700.96
conclusions over time

5697.48 --> 5704.58
that it's all broken

5700.96 --> 5704.58
there is no speed of light

5704.92 --> 5709.96
yes there is a spectrum

5707.62 --> 5713.199
and there's a speed correlation where

5709.96 --> 5716.44
there's not a causation so just because

5713.199 --> 5719.638999999999
speed has some influence somewhere

5716.44 --> 5723.58
within the expression of light doesn't

5719.639 --> 5726.76
automatically prove light has a speed

5723.58 --> 5730.54
it proves that there is another Factor

5726.76 --> 5733.12
that's really freaking mysterious

5730.54 --> 5735.82
and that's it it's like yeah there's

5733.12 --> 5737.86
light it's not one thing it's not like a

5735.82 --> 5739.42
molecule or an atom which is just like

5737.86 --> 5743.639
that's that atom is always going to

5739.42 --> 5743.639
weigh the way it is now this is light

5743.98 --> 5748.599999999999
and you can't even pinpoint how small

5746.38 --> 5750.52
life can be really

5748.6 --> 5752.679
I mean there's the quantum like there's

5750.52 --> 5754.659000000001
the quanta of light the particle

5752.679 --> 5758.679
supposedly

5754.659 --> 5760.839999999999
but that's just a measurement based on

5758.679 --> 5763.12
interaction with material the

5760.84 --> 5764.7390000000005
photoelectric effect like what what's

5763.12 --> 5767.679
the minimum amount of light that will

5764.739 --> 5769.9
trigger a photoelectric effect

5767.679 --> 5772.12
that's how they establish it but that

5769.9 --> 5774.46
that's only a measurement like that

5772.12 --> 5775.659
doesn't actually prove that that is the

5774.46 --> 5777.04
minimum

5775.659 --> 5781.199
foreign

5777.04 --> 5781.199
there's so much mystery about life

5781.6 --> 5787.0
and all this wave related

5784.3 --> 5790.42
classifications within the understanding

5787.0 --> 5793.78
of light is not helping

5790.42 --> 5797.679
it's given us a broken model that yeah

5793.78 --> 5799.78
you can use but you can't understand it

5797.679 --> 5801.88
though you can't properly understand

5799.78 --> 5803.5599999999995
light as long as you use that broken

5801.88 --> 5806.38
model

5803.56 --> 5808.659000000001
that's making claims that are obviously

5806.38 --> 5811.719
not proven

5808.659 --> 5813.82
yeah it might work out when you're

5811.719 --> 5815.86
dealing with it but you'll never

5813.82 --> 5819.42
progress your understanding about it

5815.86 --> 5823.12
because your entire vantage point of

5819.42 --> 5826.86
understanding what light actually is has

5823.12 --> 5830.26
been grossly and systematically

5826.86 --> 5833.98
misinformed through education

5830.26 --> 5835.179
and the the physics physicists among one

5833.98 --> 5838.0599999999995
another even

5835.179 --> 5840.82
and especially the astrophysicist

5838.06 --> 5844.6
Community with their speculations on top

5840.82 --> 5846.639
of those misassumptions there I mean

5844.6 --> 5849.639
this has been a

5846.639 --> 5852.1
an epic cluster screw the very

5849.639 --> 5855.179
understanding of light has been an epic

5852.1 --> 5855.179
cluster screw

5862.62 --> 5866.219
so there's that

5866.26 --> 5871.0
probably gonna put that in the title why

5868.48 --> 5872.379999999999
is 33 so unfriendly to me I don't know

5871.0 --> 5876.06
why what

5872.38 --> 5876.06
are you talking about lumpy ass

5890.1 --> 5893.6990000000005
what's going on here

5908.98 --> 5916.12
the sky is not blue because of light

5912.699 --> 5918.879999999999
it's blue with light yes

5916.12 --> 5922.139
it's the light from the sun shining

5918.88 --> 5922.139
through it that makes it blue

5924.58 --> 5929.5599999999995
if the line is and the sunlight isn't

5927.82 --> 5932.159
shining through it then it's not blue

5929.56 --> 5932.159000000001
it's black

5936.52 --> 5941.92
and if you go up really high then even

5938.86 --> 5944.44
if light is shining through it

5941.92 --> 5946.96
it's only

5944.44 --> 5948.82
where it is the most concentrated

5946.96 --> 5952.4800000000005
together

5948.82 --> 5955.0
like the most amount of air that light

5952.48 --> 5957.94
passes through will allow it to be blue

5955.0 --> 5959.98
so that above you there is no Blue Sky

5957.94 --> 5961.678999999999
it's all black because there's basically

5959.98 --> 5966.159
not enough

5961.679 --> 5968.26
air there to make it blue to create the

5966.159 --> 5971.739
blue effect that will only be under you

5968.26 --> 5974.8
even though the sun is right there

5971.739 --> 5977.138999999999
you'll be right there staring at you

5974.8 --> 5978.04
surrounded by black with blue underneath

5977.139 --> 5981.04
you

5978.04 --> 5983.199
is because there's not enough air in

5981.04 --> 5985.48
there at that height

5983.199 --> 5988.138999999999
to create the blue effect even though

5985.48 --> 5988.138999999999
there is a sun

5994.48 --> 5996.599999999999
thank you

6000.99 --> 6004.148999999999
[Music]

6008.95 --> 6012.04
[Music]

6030.73 --> 6033.889999999999
[Music]

6036.67 --> 6039.819
[Music]

6059.28 --> 6064.5
yay I got a title why the sky is blue

6062.159 --> 6066.86
and the compounded misunderstood nature

6064.5 --> 6066.86
of light

6070.08 --> 6073.159
what do you guys think

6102.92 --> 6107.46
abbreviative energy of the Sun what do

6105.42 --> 6109.139
you mean radiated

6107.46 --> 6111.119
sun is not an object it's just a

6109.139 --> 6113.34
hologram

6111.119 --> 6115.199
it doesn't radiate anything there's no

6113.34 --> 6119.400000000001
thing anywhere

6115.199 --> 6124.339999999999
from which something is coming it's a

6119.4 --> 6124.339999999999
manifest it manifests it arrives here

6126.179 --> 6130.56
there's no radiation because there's no

6128.88 --> 6132.6
place

6130.56 --> 6135.4400000000005
that it's actually coming from in

6132.6 --> 6135.4400000000005
euclidean space

6144.26 --> 6150.06
but you are right by the way that flies

6147.3 --> 6153.54
yeah they do get a lot of insects by the

6150.06 --> 6157.080000000001
way get directly energized from the sun

6153.54 --> 6159.54
it's almost like they have solar panels

6157.08 --> 6161.94
within their scales

6159.54 --> 6163.86
anybody ever notice that that it seems

6161.94 --> 6167.28
like a lot of insects

6163.86 --> 6169.38
like really thrive on heat because it's

6167.28 --> 6173.119
almost like their scales are actually

6169.38 --> 6173.119
like solar panels or something

6175.739 --> 6181.5
like where it's really sunny

6178.92 --> 6183.2390000000005
insects just crush it that they're in

6181.5 --> 6185.159
full form they're like we're the boss

6183.239 --> 6187.638999999999
here

6185.159 --> 6187.638999999999
right

6191.46 --> 6197.28
right am I right hot countries insects

6195.0 --> 6199.139
are big and badass and they feel like

6197.28 --> 6200.46
like they're radiating like they're in

6199.139 --> 6202.26
control

6200.46 --> 6205.139
it's probably because they're just the

6202.26 --> 6207.5
most charged up there because maximum

6205.139 --> 6207.5
sum

6211.199 --> 6215.82
flies go crazier around my flight yeah

6213.78 --> 6218.34
I'm sure they do become more aggressive

6215.82 --> 6221.159
they just become more motivated

6218.34 --> 6223.619000000001
and more confident in their action

6221.159 --> 6225.42
because they're charged up they're like

6223.619 --> 6227.639
charged up batteries

6225.42 --> 6230.159
right they're like they feel like

6227.639 --> 6233.88
they're new like oh I'm just a charged

6230.159 --> 6236.339999999999
up I'm at maximum capacity ah let's do

6233.88 --> 6239.46
it let's do this

6236.34 --> 6242.3
right enthusiasm just and energy-based

6239.46 --> 6242.3
enthusiasm

6243.719 --> 6248.04
so yeah I think there might be an

6246.0 --> 6250.02
interesting component

6248.04 --> 6253.38
in insects

6250.02 --> 6257.46
that they somehow

6253.38 --> 6259.9800000000005
don't only use the sun's Heat

6257.46 --> 6263.04
for fun for better functioning but also

6259.98 --> 6264.78
like they electrically charge themselves

6263.04 --> 6268.199
in some way

6264.78 --> 6270.42
like like a solar panel battery

6268.199 --> 6274.739
it really does seem like and I mean

6270.42 --> 6277.619
insects do actually like go and sit on a

6274.739 --> 6280.678999999999
on a face somewhere where they get

6277.619 --> 6282.659
maximum Sun they do actually do that to

6280.679 --> 6285.659
charge up

6282.659 --> 6288.48
by the way so do animals

6285.659 --> 6291.719
but with insects it's like it's just

6288.48 --> 6293.4
more palpable they're not just enjoying

6291.719 --> 6295.7390000000005
the Heat

6293.4 --> 6298.92
if they would just be enjoying the heat

6295.739 --> 6301.98
then having a warm room

6298.92 --> 6304.26
with warm lamps and all that right well

6301.98 --> 6307.199
it would make the insects go berserk as

6304.26 --> 6309.06
well wouldn't it they don't they don't

6307.199 --> 6312.299999999999
go berserk yeah they like to hang around

6309.06 --> 6315.179
but they usually get more sluggish well

6312.3 --> 6317.6990000000005
the actual Sun Heat

6315.179 --> 6319.04
the actual sun shining and being blowing

6317.699 --> 6322.138999999999
that's why

6319.04 --> 6324.48
that's why they get really lip Buffs fly

6322.139 --> 6328.26
right in your face and [ __ ] right that's

6324.48 --> 6332.119
the Sun that does that not the Heat

6328.26 --> 6332.119000000001
thus my case

6337.8 --> 6342.26
I should actually also put this in the

6339.96 --> 6342.26
title

6374.639 --> 6382.92
um I can't get it to fit damn it

6378.239 --> 6385.98
oh well I'll just leave it like this

6382.92 --> 6388.02
I'm gonna run out to show guys so thanks

6385.98 --> 6390.9
everyone for coming I hope you like this

6388.02 --> 6394.139
show I I liked it

6390.9 --> 6396.239
I hope for people watching like it find

6394.139 --> 6397.92
it very interesting I thought it was a

6396.239 --> 6400.138999999999
very interesting

6397.92 --> 6402.4800000000005
subject to dig into this I can dig into

6400.139 --> 6404.28
this some more especially if people are

6402.48 --> 6407.839999999999
more readily

6404.28 --> 6407.84
available with their attention

6410.04 --> 6412.619
right so we can talk about these things

6411.78 --> 6415.32
again

6412.619 --> 6417.599999999999
next time but for now I'm rounding out

6415.32 --> 6419.159
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6417.6 --> 6421.5
liked this show I thought it was great

6419.159 --> 6423.659
if you liked it then please don't forget

6421.5 --> 6426.06
the rogans it up and if you haven't

6423.659 --> 6428.219

6426.06 --> 6430.4400000000005
Bell notification so we know when I'm

6428.219 --> 6432.54
going live which is normally 1pm

6430.44 --> 6434.58
Amsterdam time in the weekdays and 2PM

6432.54 --> 6437.1
Amsterdam time in the weekend and please

6434.58 --> 6438.9
also do support me through the PayPal

appreciated and you can really use it

6441.78 --> 6446.3
right so I'll be back tomorrow with flat

6444.54 --> 6449.34
Earth early bird number

6446.3 --> 6450.719
1678 on a Wednesday and I'm going to

6449.34 --> 6453.4800000000005
join the Flat Earth debates over at

6450.719 --> 6454.86
Nathan Oakley 1980 Channel

6453.48 --> 6456.48
should be

6454.86 --> 6459.299999999999
yeah

6456.48 --> 6462.48
it's probably already live

6459.3 --> 6467.79
so hope to see you there in the chat and

6462.48 --> 6475.58
until the next video keep it flat

6467.79 --> 6477.93
[Music]

6475.58 --> 6499.0689999999995
thank you
