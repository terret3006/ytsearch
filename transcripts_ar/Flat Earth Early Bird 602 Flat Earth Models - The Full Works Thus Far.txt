cucumber right now I haven't really gone

187.15 --> 191.22
out for groceries she had just been too

189.34 --> 200.77
busy this morning

191.22 --> 203.14
mm-hmm hey you had a meeting so yeah

200.77 --> 206.53
starting out a little bit hot it might

203.14 --> 208.45
be a little slow it's no Netflix [ __ ]

206.53 --> 211.45
like yesterday cuz I didn't watch any

208.45 --> 221.56
movie this time I just had a lot of

211.45 --> 225.11999999999998
talks right so I retrospect it did

221.56 --> 228.9
really like flatters debate yesterday

225.12 --> 231.82
especially the second half was good and

228.9 --> 234.55
Benjamin was there and was also good

231.82 --> 237.459
yeah it is you know at this point more

234.55 --> 240.94
of the same but yeah it's a good type of

237.459 --> 244.9
setting so I do appreciate what he's

240.94 --> 247.15
doing still then I had another long talk

244.9 --> 249.6
with Robin Stanley oh wait that was

247.15 --> 252.55
actually before Owen Benjamin started I

249.6 --> 255.28
like the first hour because we only had

252.55 --> 260.01
a two-hour conversation just two hours

255.28 --> 262.66
quickly about yeah about art and music

260.01 --> 264.039
very extensively in Robin Stanley I

262.66 --> 265.11
don't know if you're okay with me

264.039 --> 268.639
sharing some of that

265.11 --> 276.87
I hope you don't mind but she is very

268.639 --> 279.81
much active as yak being a curator in

276.87 --> 284.819
art gallery situations very interesting

279.81 --> 289.979
story she had about that so yeah she's

284.819 --> 294.389
all about art and artists and yeah it's

289.979 --> 298.49
like I can feel it it's real and yeah it

294.389 --> 302.37
does make me curious it's always good to

298.49 --> 305.039
find out about somebody you're

302.37 --> 315.419
acquainted with having special talents

305.039 --> 318.65
so that was kind of cool yeah I didn't

315.419 --> 318.65
really continue in my book

321.229 --> 328.169
yeah the flat earth debates right

325.939 --> 335.46000000000004
yeah the flat earth debates were also

328.169 --> 337.94899999999996
very good I was very fluid in the

335.46 --> 343.349
episode yesterday so there was a good

337.949 --> 344.759
one president did most of it except yeah

343.349 --> 347.31
they have to show I was kind of like

344.759 --> 350.819
having lunch in between so it was part I

347.31 --> 353.009
wasn't active but very active but yeah I

350.819 --> 357.15000000000003
know it's Friday so I always give it my

353.009 --> 361.789
extra best and then today yeah I pretty

357.15 --> 361.789
much after yesterday just listened music

362.12 --> 368.839
more game music and there's a lot of it

364.8 --> 368.839
around and

370.82 --> 375.45
yeah it's kind of brought me into a new

373.35 --> 379.32000000000005
mood a more active mood I also seek out

375.45 --> 382.84999999999997
those songs and yeah this morning I

379.32 --> 385.65
started basically cleaning up my room

382.85 --> 388.23
big time like not just the the floor the

385.65 --> 390.12
dust and all that [ __ ] but like it's

388.23 --> 392.34000000000003
been kind of a mess here I keep the

390.12 --> 394.47
camera mostly out of it because if you

392.34 --> 398.09999999999997
go all the way over here you'll see that

394.47 --> 401.04
it's yeah it could be a lot better and

398.1 --> 403.71000000000004
I'm yeah I've come a long way I like

401.04 --> 407.55
threw away about a kilogram of paper

403.71 --> 409.14
junk paper that yeah how it started is

407.55 --> 410.64
that I was just getting my notes and

409.14 --> 412.16999999999996
then the whole paper just fell on the

410.64 --> 414.71999999999997
ground and that pissed me off so bad I

412.17 --> 417.96000000000004
was like okay [ __ ] this [ __ ] I'm going

414.72 --> 421.62
to throw most of this away and organize

417.96 --> 423.59999999999997
the rest properly I also finally I don't

421.62 --> 425.31
know why I'd put post ponies things it

423.6 --> 427.74
really does correlate with how messy my

425.31 --> 429.78000000000003
room is like the more messy it gets the

427.74 --> 432.39
more attentive postpone things so I

429.78 --> 434.25
finally scanned in all the cosmogony

432.39 --> 439.77
drawings like the the different type of

434.25 --> 444.62
looping setups archive them and now yeah

439.77 --> 448.85999999999996
the little table over here is quite

444.62 --> 450.96
clean it's just my notebook and just the

448.86 --> 453.87
rest of my stock and smoke and stuff and

450.96 --> 458.15999999999997
all that and I'm gonna continue

453.87 --> 462.15
organizing and yeah if plans it depends

458.16 --> 464.76000000000005
on how far I can take it because there

462.15 --> 466.73999999999995
is so much junk just standing and I

464.76 --> 469.55
don't have a proper closet well there is

466.74 --> 474.12
a closet downstairs it's not really used

469.55 --> 476.34000000000003
so I'm thinking of getting it so well

474.12 --> 478.92
clean up that I can actually kind of

476.34 --> 481.71
hijack that closet and just put it here

478.92 --> 484.38
and stack a lot of stuff in it to

481.71 --> 487.44
finally get it out of the way and give

484.38 --> 490.77
me some more real room so then I have to

487.44 --> 492.78
walk around things or displace objects

490.77 --> 495.65999999999997
in order to get into the closet over

492.78 --> 502.88
yeah over there

495.66 --> 507.66
there there right at right closet it's a

502.88 --> 512.31
like typical IKEA thing just the storage

507.66 --> 516.479
rack as it were but I'd needed huh

512.31 --> 518.25
so I've been very busy on that and it's

516.479 --> 520.44
good and there's so much it junk that

518.25 --> 523.53
I've just laid kept laying around from

520.44 --> 525.33
the past and yeah sometimes I'm just

523.53 --> 527.22
embarrassed to even realize like why did

525.33 --> 533.97
I thought it was a good idea to save

527.22 --> 536.25
that yeah so I've basically I'm cleaning

533.97 --> 538.23
a big time and I really wants the mess

536.25 --> 541.11
out of the way also yeah another

538.23 --> 542.79
motivation for this is that now if you

541.11 --> 544.83
take a notice with the last couple of

542.79 --> 547.89
shows there's like often flies and

544.83 --> 549.57
they're like get really annoying they

547.89 --> 552.0
really want to get in front of the

549.57 --> 556.44
camera and [ __ ] so maybe that's kind of

552.0 --> 560.22
what triggered it also mm-hmm hey guns

556.44 --> 562.4300000000001
have nephron RMP PayPal okay I'll check

560.22 --> 562.4300000000001
it

566.6 --> 576.14
thank you very much you do always

572.96 --> 580.64
announce it ahead of time they do pre

576.14 --> 584.48
whoa okay that's the big one thank you

580.64 --> 591.65
very much thank you very much Guns of

584.48 --> 594.5600000000001
Navarone is 50 euros holy you never do

591.65 --> 599.26
things small do you but I like it thank

594.56 --> 602.06
you very much it's unbelievably helpful

599.26 --> 604.04
because yeah the financial pressure is

602.06 --> 610.04
somewhat on me a little even though he

604.04 --> 612.11
thinks we're going kind of good also I

610.04 --> 615.17
might need to update you guys that I did

612.11 --> 617.03
actually order some new supplements or I

615.17 --> 619.4599999999999
rather old supplements today

617.03 --> 621.14
that I ran out from the infowar store

619.46 --> 624.47
because I pair that I can order from

621.14 --> 626.33
there just two products the iodine no

624.47 --> 630.2900000000001
because they are the only ones that have

626.33 --> 633.14
that version and it was at full discount

630.29 --> 637.43
and yes something else that's so

633.14 --> 639.9499999999999
important so yes it shouldn't be too big

637.43 --> 642.7099999999999
of a burden even altogether but like the

639.95 --> 645.11
iodine last bottle I did like two years

642.71 --> 647.6600000000001
with that and it helped a lot and it

645.11 --> 652.5500000000001
will help again so I got that coming but

647.66 --> 655.25
I just can't order the air system it's a

652.55 --> 656.24
like a kid as soon as I added that to

655.25 --> 659.0
the shopping cart

656.24 --> 661.25
suddenly I did just the the system broke

659.0 --> 664.43
it literally cants they apparently don't

661.25 --> 668.36
send it outside of the US but it's not

664.43 --> 671.0
explicitly said within the shop like

668.36 --> 674.69
doesn't ship outside of the US very

671.0 --> 676.97
frustrating so yeah there's no fresh air

674.69 --> 680.09
system coming to me anytime soon I'm

676.97 --> 681.83
afraid despite that I really wanted it

680.09 --> 684.7900000000001
because it was extremely cheap available

681.83 --> 684.7900000000001
at the time

685.41 --> 688.5899999999999
[Music]

689.39 --> 696.12
nobody there well yes there are here too

693.27 --> 699.6899999999999
but they're never with those levels of

696.12 --> 705.21
discount and there yeah I don't know the

699.69 --> 706.6500000000001
product yes a white shirt from being

705.21 --> 709.47
wearing a lot of white shirts I got

706.65 --> 712.89
multiple white shirts these days when

709.47 --> 721.22
it's hot I wear it don't run I just feel

712.89 --> 721.22
like it so alright marcantel work good

721.79 --> 728.43
well see I'm on quite a lot of

725.04 --> 730.3499999999999
supplements actually but that's one of

728.43 --> 732.51
them that I'm not on you know I think

730.35 --> 734.82
that if I get got it back I could

732.51 --> 737.13
probably cut down on the total amount of

734.82 --> 738.8100000000001
supplements and I'm taking overall so

737.13 --> 739.91
it's actually going to potentially save

738.81 --> 742.1099999999999
me some money

739.91 --> 744.29
yeah I always think about these things

742.11 --> 750.839
because it's expensive

744.29 --> 754.56
surviving yeah yeah but I'm afraid that

750.839 --> 756.96
there's just no air system coming like

754.56 --> 760.52
it's eventually want one back somehow

756.96 --> 763.6500000000001
but it just can't really figure it out

760.52 --> 765.81
how to do it in this point and with all

763.65 --> 769.5889999999999
the extra financial burdens coming on

765.81 --> 772.77
top of it it's just it feels too risky

769.589 --> 775.83
to take a risk on a new type of product

772.77 --> 778.37
that I don't know much about but who

775.83 --> 781.38
knows maybe I'll bump into something

778.37 --> 786.03
just at this point it's like kind of

781.38 --> 788.7
move down on the on the list priorities

786.03 --> 793.0699999999999
right now first I'm just gonna really

788.7 --> 795.9000000000001
clean up [ __ ] that's my current focus

793.07 --> 800.19
six drops of selenium yeah yeah selenium

795.9 --> 802.26
I got that too although I don't really

800.19 --> 804.5400000000001
need to use it that often because hey I

802.26 --> 806.43
take Tamera coffee and that's mud like

804.54 --> 814.77
there's a lot of curcuma

806.43 --> 818.6899999999999
stuff in there so I don't really need it

814.77 --> 818.6899999999999
that much because I use Tamera coffee

819.23 --> 824.089
but I do have the supplement as a backup

828.47 --> 831.47
anyway

837.07 --> 845.0790000000001
yeah yeah ramen Stanley man you're

841.149 --> 847.54
really firing up my just the

845.079 --> 849.88
confrontation through your stories with

847.54 --> 855.2199999999999
the people you deal with is it's kind of

849.88 --> 857.86
like fired up my artistic side I think

855.22 --> 859.48
because I feel just a lot of pulse like

857.86 --> 861.279
to do stuff but it's not an even

859.48 --> 864.4300000000001
necessarily writing you know I've never

861.279 --> 866.889
been a writer like that it's only when

864.43 --> 872.55
ideas really hit me that I tend to write

866.889 --> 882.37
them down always been more creative in

872.55 --> 884.4399999999999
sketching shapes in that direction but

882.37 --> 887.399
it is yeah you have definitely inspired

884.44 --> 890.7090000000001
me and I feel like there's more coming

887.399 --> 892.75
that I'm seeking it out now like it's

890.709 --> 894.79
time to produce a kind of reference

892.75 --> 898.87
yesterday you know even weird esoteric

894.79 --> 901.7199999999999
way like it correlates that if I do this

898.87 --> 904.63
it will probably get me more stress in

901.72 --> 907.63
some way but afterward there's a natural

904.63 --> 919.3
consequent but I got it because why else

907.63 --> 922.149
am I even here anyway yeah this morning

919.3 --> 926.4399999999999
I also had a nice Skype call with Staz

922.149 --> 928.18
Moretz I don't think he's in the chat

926.44 --> 932.1
right now oh yeah he said it's just that

928.18 --> 938.62
hello what he had he was busy

932.1 --> 940.029
yeah stats is a Dutch guy and apparently

938.62 --> 943.389
he isn't a flat earther

940.029 --> 945.639
he's very open so yeah I get the feeling

943.389 --> 948.13
he's like a everything but flat earther

945.639 --> 951.939
and it just doesn't want to focus on

948.13 --> 954.009
that too much personally it seems but

951.939 --> 956.199
yeah interesting and yeah it's

954.009 --> 958.24
interesting to get a get to know

956.199 --> 961.0
somebody new and I laid down a lot of

958.24 --> 962.819
ideas to him and it's what's kind of fun

961.0 --> 968.35
talking in touch about all this stuff

962.819 --> 971.019
don't do that very often alright so yeah

968.35 --> 973.0
maybe we could do like a recorded thing

971.019 --> 976.5
sometime if you feel like it maybe you

973.0 --> 976.5
don't I would understand

978.53 --> 983.35
[Music]

993.3 --> 1001.3199999999999
there sells air filters yeah they do

997.98 --> 1006.15
it's just I'm not familiar with those

1001.32 --> 1009.36
brands there's hundreds of them but I'd

1006.15 --> 1011.8199999999999
like to get one that yeah I don't want

1009.36 --> 1013.47
to be occupied every year trying to find

1011.82 --> 1017.36
a new filter or something or dealing

1013.47 --> 1023.4200000000001
with things that break and [ __ ] I just

1017.36 --> 1025.8
wanted to get a reliable product I trust

1023.42 --> 1028.6499999999999
through more personal people's

1025.8 --> 1030.6599999999999
testimonies or my own so that's why I

1028.65 --> 1033.24
originally just wanted the same system

1030.66 --> 1037.5890000000002
back but I could do that but again it's

1033.24 --> 1039.39
very expensive like compared to the

1037.589 --> 1041.31
Alexa pure breeze it's like

1039.39 --> 1046.0200000000002
two-and-a-half times more expensive at

1041.31 --> 1049.1699999999998
least so this is just yeah it seems

1046.02 --> 1051.18
irresponsible financially to do to go

1049.17 --> 1053.49
for that and haven't really managed to

1051.18 --> 1057.51
get it together got half of it and then

1053.49 --> 1060.15
Finance is halted somehow I don't know

1057.51 --> 1061.92
when somebody drops like 250 euros on

1060.15 --> 1063.8700000000001
you it tends to basically choke out

1061.92 --> 1067.22
everybody else's response financially

1063.87 --> 1070.1699999999998
and that's I think exactly what happened

1067.22 --> 1071.91
yeah other than that I don't have a lot

1070.17 --> 1075.41
of complaints because you guys have been

1071.91 --> 1083.1000000000001
supporting me on the very regular basis

1075.41 --> 1085.98
and that is well this is not I'm not

1083.1 --> 1089.9099999999999
like it's not enabling me to save up to

1085.98 --> 1092.73
eventually get the fresh air system but

1089.91 --> 1094.53
it's absolutely keeping me stable yeah

1092.73 --> 1096.8700000000001
including with some of the financial

1094.53 --> 1101.34
temporary setbacks that I explained

1096.87 --> 1104.07
about so please do keep supporting me

1101.34 --> 1107.549
and yeah of course Guns of Navarone big

1104.07 --> 1110.989
support 50 euros thank you so much

1107.549 --> 1110.989
and all the others too

1124.96 --> 1130.58
well George Sanford look if you know

1127.73 --> 1133.64
about it then please contact me on skype

1130.58 --> 1135.11
about it and let's talk you know if you

1133.64 --> 1138.98
can help me make a well informed

1135.11 --> 1146.6499999999999
decision that is within reach then

1138.98 --> 1146.65
please help me out if you can but yeah

1148.03 --> 1152.3
we need to figure out the orientation of

1150.98 --> 1154.49
the Equator

1152.3 --> 1159.35
yeah good servant oh it's a difficult

1154.49 --> 1169.88
one and it is it is only an anchor it's

1159.35 --> 1173.51
a beginning point again yeah of course I

1169.88 --> 1175.4
scanned in my pictures so I could show

1173.51 --> 1177.26
them without holding them up in front of

1175.4 --> 1180.95
the camera where you can barely see it I

1177.26 --> 1187.48
can actually show it through the

1180.95 --> 1187.48
computer now I'm gonna get into that Oh

1188.44 --> 1193.79
seriously I've constantly got music

1191.24 --> 1206.68
echoing in my head from baldur's gate

1193.79 --> 1208.97
it's so amazing yeah that's cool

1206.68 --> 1211.28
well I should share this again I found

1208.97 --> 1213.44
this in wild cleaning up you know and

1211.28 --> 1217.6399999999999
that's the problem like good stuff gets

1213.44 --> 1219.17
lost in between paper [ __ ] like I

1217.64 --> 1221.24
could have accidentally overlooked this

1219.17 --> 1223.3100000000002
and just threw it away but thank God I

1221.24 --> 1226.21
looked carefully as I always do when it

1223.31 --> 1226.21
comes to paper works

1242.63 --> 1247.5490000000002
okay let's see how we're gonna do this

1253.56 --> 1261.7
that still looks kinda blurry though

1256.65 --> 1263.68
that yeah I think I'd if I wanted to me

1261.7 --> 1267.5800000000002
properly visible on the computer I

1263.68 --> 1269.98
really have to photoshop it to make the

1267.58 --> 1272.74
contrast more more yeah

1269.98 --> 1277.35
outspoken anyway here's picture I found

1272.74 --> 1281.74
back see that it's a flying city

1277.35 --> 1293.8899999999999
offering above a pyramid charging it how

1281.74 --> 1299.4
about that it's jet still going you said

1293.89 --> 1299.4
or is it stuck is still going

1301.89 --> 1310.3200000000002
I was only but all right well George

1305.97 --> 1312.78
Sanford look maybe I'll just have to do

1310.32 --> 1315.4199999999998
it from scratch search the problem is

1312.78 --> 1321.03
that I'm not really too good in finding

1315.42 --> 1324.3300000000002
new products with Google and [ __ ] anyway

1321.03 --> 1330.06
this is that on that thing

1324.33 --> 1331.59
let's move the picture forward alright

1330.06 --> 1339.06
so this was another one I already shared

1331.59 --> 1343.58
this once ago this is alright and here

1339.06 --> 1343.58
are the that's a good thing I already

1349.8 --> 1355.559
I have to contrast in the drawing itself

1353.12 --> 1358.01
right here's that one and then here's

1355.559 --> 1358.01
that one

1362.82 --> 1369.96
and here is the ring so yeah the equator

1365.88 --> 1373.6200000000001
line there is an odd suspicion from my

1369.96 --> 1377.6100000000001
side that since this is the most

1373.62 --> 1380.7299999999998
mind-blowing surreal concept that I've

1377.61 --> 1384.899
been able to come up with concerning

1380.73 --> 1387.3890000000001
what if the Equator was a circle yet it

1384.899 --> 1391.4399999999998
wasn't a literal disc I think this might

1387.389 --> 1396.539
just be it because it basically combines

1391.44 --> 1399.5700000000002
everything like yeah it's a circle but

1396.539 --> 1404.73
it's also interconnects as straight

1399.57 --> 1408.509
segments and they geometrically don't

1404.73 --> 1413.94
technically fit but yet they do the

1408.509 --> 1416.519
segment's and I think I don't know I've

1413.94 --> 1418.8890000000001
heard a lot of defenses from the Flat

1416.519 --> 1422.1
Earth the discourse about issues with

1418.889 --> 1424.49
flight times and distances and even map

1422.1 --> 1427.5
measurement that there is a great

1424.49 --> 1430.71
indication that the equator line might

1427.5 --> 1435.45
actually be circular but again that's

1430.71 --> 1439.919
not the end of it like going from that

1435.45 --> 1442.1100000000001
vantage point what typically happens is

1439.919 --> 1444.1490000000001
that yeah then you have to deal with the

1442.11 --> 1446.85
inside and the outside beyond the

1444.149 --> 1449.4899999999998
equator if you're gonna presume it's a

1446.85 --> 1451.889
circle which it probably is and that

1449.49 --> 1453.8700000000001
everything beyond that is still not to

1451.889 --> 1457.9499999999998
scale and then like how do you properly

1453.87 --> 1461.58
fit it to kind of get it sized wide

1457.95 --> 1463.44
surface wise on the same level but it's

1461.58 --> 1468.87
projections that are distorted

1463.44 --> 1476.3600000000001
technically and this this version kind

1468.87 --> 1478.78
of kind of gives an insight into how and

1476.36 --> 1481.1899999999998
why

1478.78 --> 1484.1299999999999
going with a baseline assumption that

1481.19 --> 1486.41
the interconnection of speciality within

1484.13 --> 1497.2600000000002
the physical realm is not entirely

1486.41 --> 1497.26
spatially linear so yeah that pictures

1501.94 --> 1509.63
see if it can do that all right let's

1505.34 --> 1512.36
get to some rectangular Oh perspective

1509.63 --> 1514.46
this is an early attempt to try to

1512.36 --> 1520.6
figure out the optical slant it's

1514.46 --> 1525.3400000000001
interesting right here you got the earth

1520.6 --> 1529.6399999999999
segments is the early version and oh

1525.34 --> 1534.23
yeah put my light different ways to

1529.64 --> 1538.7900000000002
perceive the sunlight with a from a ball

1534.23 --> 1541.85
shining on and a light manifest to the

1538.79 --> 1544.94
observer and how to kind of represent

1541.85 --> 1549.1399999999999
that so that one is in between there as

1544.94 --> 1553.7
well of course my original fourth

1549.14 --> 1556.7900000000002
dimensional tube earth in a surreal

1553.7 --> 1558.8
fashion I saw this in a vision like

1556.79 --> 1567.92
almost literally mind-boggling that I

1558.8 --> 1571.79
did right rectangular looping Earth from

1567.92 --> 1575.29
a illogically high perception point and

1571.79 --> 1577.67
yeah as if the realm was literally

1575.29 --> 1579.71
connected and it would have to be a tube

1577.67 --> 1583.25
but yeah there's no curvature so it's

1579.71 --> 1586.67
looping of course we're it's a real

1583.25 --> 1592.45
Brazil representation and yeah this is

1586.67 --> 1592.45
the one the equator and the ant equator

1592.57 --> 1596.1399999999999
how that works

1609.049 --> 1616.379
right and this is presuming that the

1613.98 --> 1618.72
Equator is a straight line it makes it

1616.379 --> 1621.36
easier to visualize a lot easier and you

1618.72 --> 1624.95
can when the equator is when everything

1621.36 --> 1624.9499999999998
is all straight when the distance is

1625.399 --> 1630.899
from east to west are all the same

1628.11 --> 1632.9089999999999
distances I don't know if they are then

1630.899 --> 1635.4899999999998
it's kind of easy to represent how the

1632.909 --> 1637.74
realm segments interact or interconnect

1635.49 --> 1640.559
with one another but yeah it is in

1637.74 --> 1642.86
actuality if it is much more like this

1640.559 --> 1649.47
it's it's much more likely that it is

1642.86 --> 1652.799
let me flick back that it is more like

1649.47 --> 1654.69
this which it's basically the same thing

1652.799 --> 1657.809
this is a top view though the other one

1654.69 --> 1661.1390000000001
was a side view and with this version

1657.809 --> 1663.33
then the distances from north from East

1661.139 --> 1665.279
the West are shorter when you go away

1663.33 --> 1667.86
from the equator the interconnect

1665.279 --> 1669.69
looping wise more directly and then

1667.86 --> 1673.049
there's like a choking point at the

1669.69 --> 1677.159
antique waiters so there's very little

1673.049 --> 1680.999
space to go through in order to not look

1677.159 --> 1688.5590000000002
back onto the realm itself but actually

1680.999 --> 1692.94
proceed to enter a new realm segment so

1688.559 --> 1695.369
I think for a rectangular looping model

1692.94 --> 1697.8890000000001
conception I think this is probably the

1695.369 --> 1700.559
most likely also because it plays into

1697.889 --> 1703.2589999999998
the concept of the flat globe because

1700.559 --> 1706.95
that is what it would be mistaken for in

1703.259 --> 1709.799
this setup it's already very similar to

1706.95 --> 1713.8500000000001
certain ways the Earth maps are

1709.799 --> 1716.039
projected yeah because it would be like

1713.85 --> 1718.4399999999998
rectangular looping projected onto it

1716.039 --> 1721.74
with some bending north and south

1718.44 --> 1725.1290000000001
towards the center and all that but that

1721.74 --> 1727.379
would be literal and this suggests like

1725.129 --> 1730.08
how does it cut interconnect if our

1727.379 --> 1732.08
realm is kind of laid out like it is a

1730.08 --> 1735.389
flat globe

1732.08 --> 1737.6899999999998
like a globe that is unfolded and just

1735.389 --> 1737.6899999999998
flat

1741.35 --> 1756.1799999999998
all right see let's let's flick to some

1752.51 --> 1761.4
oversight stuff ah my original drawing

1756.18 --> 1764.04
and then my original drawing with text

1761.4 --> 1768.8700000000001
updates alright does this this one's a

1764.04 --> 1775.47
bigger version yeah four years ago

1768.87 --> 1778.6999999999998
people four years ago you can also see

1775.47 --> 1781.83
that within these things it's like still

1778.7 --> 1783.9
not a giant strip except for the squared

1781.83 --> 1787.9199999999998
rectangular ring earth and there's a

1783.9 --> 1789.5400000000002
very small piece yeah only very small

1787.92 --> 1791.73
space that it takes up and there's not a

1789.54 --> 1794.43
lot of there's no spatial irregularities

1791.73 --> 1796.23
from east to west in this present age

1794.43 --> 1798.63
yeah in this representation at all it's

1796.23 --> 1801.27
pretty much a straight rectangle in this

1798.63 --> 1803.5800000000002
version because I only later realize

1801.27 --> 1806.25
like yeah it probably if it is like that

1803.58 --> 1808.86
with a rectangular element it's probably

1806.25 --> 1818.61
more warped it's probably not all

1808.86 --> 1821.0
literal the surface so yeah that's my

1818.61 --> 1821.0
work

1836.139 --> 1840.83
it's interesting how many drawings have

1838.669 --> 1842.1390000000001
come together they also notice that I do

1840.83 --> 1845.1789999999999
have a style

1842.139 --> 1848.99
besides being kind of blurry and sketchy

1845.179 --> 1851.299
this is if there is a consistent in what

1848.99 --> 1854.299
I'm detecting in how I draw is funny how

1851.299 --> 1858.2
that works I don't aim to I'm just

1854.299 --> 1861.5
trying to put down visually on paper

1858.2 --> 1863.3890000000001
what I got in my mind aren't these flat

1861.5 --> 1867.86
earth models yes they are all manator

1863.389 --> 1870.4599999999998
yes they are I'm not literally reifying

1867.86 --> 1872.9799999999998
them into reality through science though

1870.46 --> 1876.799
these are all presuppositional

1872.98 --> 1880.94
conceptualizations they are falsifiable

1876.799 --> 1884.48
each and every one of them and it the

1880.94 --> 1888.3790000000001
falsifiability lies within our grasp

1884.48 --> 1891.71
within this realm so yeah makes it a lot

1888.379 --> 1894.379
better than the globe model which the

1891.71 --> 1897.049
foundations of it are already disproven

1894.379 --> 1900.1689999999999
there's no presupposing something if it

1897.049 --> 1907.6689999999999
is already disproving that's that's

1900.169 --> 1911.419
stupid if you do that yeah you're

1907.669 --> 1913.69
welcome Robin Stanley that was my

1911.419 --> 1913.69
gallery

1923.63 --> 1927.17
too bad Nathan never lets me present

1925.91 --> 1929.93
anything gets nonsense

1927.17 --> 1933.16
I present things on the fly all the time

1929.93 --> 1935.66
well not all the time but regularly I

1933.16 --> 1938.69
did even on the Friday show and the

1935.66 --> 1941.75
Thursday show looks I create new

1938.69 --> 1944.99
concepts even within the heliocentric

1941.75 --> 1949.31
conception I like to basically where

1944.99 --> 1952.16
NASA makes up new [ __ ] I like to like oh

1949.31 --> 1954.26
I'm going to play with that by taking it

1952.16 --> 1956.89
literal and then drawing parallel

1954.26 --> 1959.42
consequences to the rest of heliocentric

1956.89 --> 1962.21
conception I like to do that I like to

1959.42 --> 1965.39
play around you know heliocentrism is

1962.21 --> 1969.08
like my virtual Legos and Nathan does

1965.39 --> 1973.25
accept it because I'm very very clear

1969.08 --> 1977.4399999999998
about my approach I don't take it for

1973.25 --> 1977.44
real I don't real fire it into reality

1983.519 --> 1997.6490000000001
you don't get it boy neech out here but

1993.289 --> 2000.289
what about it don't you get the trainman

1997.649 --> 2004.279
station not from the matrix - not a good

2000.289 --> 2007.36
example is spatial non-linearity how

2004.279 --> 2009.71
about Doctor Who's time-traveling device

2007.36 --> 2012.0089999999998
with the impossible amount of space that

2009.71 --> 2015.019
fits in that little booth how about that

2012.009 --> 2018.47
so there's many examples in science

2015.019 --> 2024.919
fiction of spatial non-linearity and

2018.47 --> 2028.279
looping or it already exists let alone

2024.919 --> 2030.679
in games like games the game portal is

2028.279 --> 2034.22
literally just utilizing it to the

2030.679 --> 2037.8200000000002
maximum you could say to the maximum

2034.22 --> 2039.6200000000001
probably I know about it I haven't

2037.82 --> 2041.0
actually played it because that was

2039.62 --> 2044.5089999999998
exactly around the time when I started

2041.0 --> 2049.25
to get really sick fists physically sick

2044.509 --> 2051.679
from 3d games so I skipped on that but I

2049.25 --> 2055.159
dunno about it I've seen people talk

2051.679 --> 2057.319
about it and argue it and yeah it is

2055.159 --> 2059.599
everything about portals and looping and

2057.319 --> 2062.149
yeah you can call it a portal and then

2059.599 --> 2066.319
you associate the portal with a disk

2062.149 --> 2068.419
space that connects this space with the

2066.319 --> 2070.73
other spaces continue allottee and you

2068.419 --> 2074.2999999999997
know you can get that right it has to be

2070.73 --> 2075.859
a portal has to be a portal well what

2074.3 --> 2080.3
I'm basically suggesting well that

2075.859 --> 2083.899
portal is simply the like an entire

2080.3 --> 2087.099
segment like a cross-section of

2083.899 --> 2090.2
everything and that cross-section is

2087.099 --> 2093.079
directly interconnection interconnected

2090.2 --> 2095.3889999999997
with another cross-section of the realm

2093.079 --> 2100.88
on the other side and it is continual

2095.389 --> 2105.1600000000003
now that's a loop so it is an integrated

2100.88 --> 2108.77
portal that that spans the entire

2105.16 --> 2112.5699999999997
confine of the realm in a certain angle

2108.77 --> 2117.35
as it were that's looping

2112.57 --> 2126.07
am i helping you do you get it now

2117.35 --> 2126.0699999999997
I said either Cosentino I don't know

2156.66 --> 2168.87
all right good good to hear because I

2166.8 --> 2170.94
don't know for me it's second nature but

2168.87 --> 2177.5099999999998
I think about this on a daily basis it's

2170.94 --> 2179.82
I made it a second nature I almost need

2177.51 --> 2181.9700000000003
I needed to do that because otherwise I

2179.82 --> 2186.38
would have probably dropped the idea

2181.97 --> 2192.81
because nobody was getting me nobody

2186.38 --> 2196.2000000000003
nobody was willing to even entertain the

2192.81 --> 2198.7999999999997
thought I guess that it might be real

2196.2 --> 2201.62
like it might be real and it seems like

2198.8 --> 2204.6000000000004
yeah that was very discouraging at first

2201.62 --> 2208.1099999999997
so then I kind of said like okay well

2204.6 --> 2209.94
screw you all then I am going to

2208.11 --> 2212.4900000000002
champion this and I don't give a [ __ ] if

2209.94 --> 2214.44
nobody gets it if in the end I'm the

2212.49 --> 2216.18
only one that gets it I'm still gonna do

2214.44 --> 2219.69
it I'm still gonna expand on it I'm

2216.18 --> 2220.95
gonna do everything that I can and if

2219.69 --> 2223.4700000000003
that means I'm gonna have to do it

2220.95 --> 2225.6
entirely on my own and the entire world

2223.47 --> 2227.31
will be laughing at me every step of the

2225.6 --> 2229.41
way not just trolls but just everyone

2227.31 --> 2231.06
like either people laughing that don't

2229.41 --> 2233.58
get it or people that don't get it are

2231.06 --> 2235.77
silent and get nervous for me I don't

2233.58 --> 2240.23
care I'm gonna figure it out I'm gonna

2235.77 --> 2244.44
champion what I do until it is settled

2240.23 --> 2247.05
until its final until the route within

2244.44 --> 2249.39
the presuppositional potential of the

2247.05 --> 2250.4100000000003
realm is completely figuring out like oh

2249.39 --> 2252.0899999999997
the equator is straight the eighth

2250.41 --> 2253.74
graders learned the 8th grader is a

2252.09 --> 2255.6000000000004
circle and from there on how does it

2253.74 --> 2259.47
interconnect next step next step next

2255.6 --> 2262.56
step until we have it hey if what we got

2259.47 --> 2265.98
at the end of it if people don't get

2262.56 --> 2268.29
that that's their freaking problem it's

2265.98 --> 2270.69
their problem if they don't get it I'm

2268.29 --> 2273.39
going to make certain it's gonna be

2270.69 --> 2275.43
correct and I don't give a [ __ ] about

2273.39 --> 2278.67
people's preconceptions and their

2275.43 --> 2281.1
willingness to adapt the end result to

2278.67 --> 2284.31
make it a little bit more understandable

2281.1 --> 2287.27
oh [ __ ] you I'm gonna get it for real

2284.31 --> 2290.0099999999998
and give a [ __ ] if people get it or not

2287.27 --> 2293.39
although I will do my best to keep on

2290.01 --> 2296.88
explaining it to those that don't get it

2293.39 --> 2300.96
but it's not my priority my priority is

2296.88 --> 2308.6400000000003
to figure it out because lift long

2300.96 --> 2310.95
enough to know that nobody else is but

2308.64 --> 2315.18
it's just busy trying to reify the new

2310.95 --> 2327.5989999999997
disk model into reality I'm not gonna be

2315.18 --> 2329.5789999999997
part of that hmm thanks with twits yeah

2327.599 --> 2333.4100000000003
I'm surprised I even have some color in

2329.579 --> 2333.4100000000003
my skin there used to be a lot more peel

2339.19 --> 2349.84
if it is too complex it's probably wrong

2342.66 --> 2354.25
well that Martin telluric only kinds for

2349.84 --> 2360.9100000000003
things that are too difficult to try and

2354.25 --> 2363.58
prove Yeah right that's what that is

2360.91 --> 2366.43
about is about falsifiability it's

2363.58 --> 2368.29
basically the pseudoscience spin-doctors

2366.43 --> 2371.71
answer to you gotta have a

2368.29 --> 2374.05
falsifiability to a theory or it's

2371.71 --> 2376.75
pseudoscience and that is their answer

2374.05 --> 2379.8100000000004
to it it's too complex it's probably

2376.75 --> 2382.74
wrong well you could just go with is it

2379.81 --> 2386.34
falsifiable is it proven or disproven

2382.74 --> 2389.5
you know and every step of my

2386.34 --> 2392.2000000000003
preconceptions is falsifiable every step

2389.5 --> 2394.33
of the way it's a nice entire worked out

2392.2 --> 2396.43
structure of the potential possibilities

2394.33 --> 2398.83
that are out there in every direction

2396.43 --> 2402.8199999999997
and many directions I can think of so

2398.83 --> 2406.33
far and it's all falsifiable so yeah it

2402.82 --> 2408.73
may seem too complex but I'm not saying

2406.33 --> 2413.38
that it's going to be like mechanically

2408.73 --> 2417.58
too complex it's just a baseline surreal

2413.38 --> 2420.4300000000003
element that people can't get used to

2417.58 --> 2422.5299999999997
from a personal perspective not because

2420.43 --> 2426.8199999999997
it's too complex but because it's too

2422.53 --> 2428.65
surreal for them to accept they can't

2426.82 --> 2432.78
get latched their spirit on it has

2428.65 --> 2437.85
nothing to do with technical complexity

2432.78 --> 2437.8500000000004
that's not the main issue with it

2451.19 --> 2460.549
some cares outreach men I don't give a

2455.729 --> 2460.549
[ __ ] it's just like that

2466.7 --> 2469.75
[Music]

2483.23 --> 2487.909
yeah

2485.029 --> 2491.869
and I'm pretty sure in the past it was

2487.909 --> 2496.969
known and there were probably very few

2491.869 --> 2499.4
people that had it crystal clear what

2496.969 --> 2501.64
the actual realm is in its entirety I

2499.4 --> 2504.289
think it was figured out long ago and

2501.64 --> 2507.859
those people that knew it were probably

2504.289 --> 2510.5890000000004
all eye functioning priests some kind

2507.859 --> 2512.269
and they were all killed by the Jesuits

2510.589 --> 2516.529
when they went around in the world to

2512.269 --> 2519.14
completely erase the knowledge and the

2516.529 --> 2527.839
the handful of people that actually were

2519.14 --> 2533.019
able to get it all happened probably

2527.839 --> 2538.489
quite long ago and I'm gonna rebuild it

2533.019 --> 2541.64
everything I'm gonna undo the damage and

2538.489 --> 2544.669
yeah yeah and after I'm gone they could

2541.64 --> 2552.169
probably do it all over again that's not

2544.669 --> 2557.8689999999997
gonna deter me I am gonna do it and in a

2552.169 --> 2562.209
way yeah if they're gonna try something

2557.869 --> 2564.4390000000003
to redo it I'm gonna make the price so

2562.209 --> 2567.339
unbelievably high for them that they

2564.439 --> 2567.339
can't do it

2569.319 --> 2575.96
in a way I have an idea

2572.69 --> 2577.91
I don't know if it's ever gonna work to

2575.96 --> 2581.539
somehow figure it out and then spread

2577.91 --> 2583.7889999999998
the knowledge to every single human

2581.539 --> 2585.5890000000004
being including children I don't know

2583.789 --> 2586.88
maybe I'll do it psionically or

2585.589 --> 2588.529
something I don't know what where it's

2586.88 --> 2592.69
gonna go I'm gonna make sure that all

2588.529 --> 2592.69
that knowledge will never go away again

2593.38 --> 2606.049
I'm so sick of Lies I want it out of the

2597.079 --> 2607.4
world yeah you can yeah you can't attack

2606.049 --> 2610.91
them you know that and we know that now

2607.4 --> 2615.9500000000003
but maybe we could just spiritually

2610.91 --> 2618.7889999999998
immunize everyone so all they could do

2615.95 --> 2618.7889999999998
is just rot away

2625.81 --> 2630.5299999999997
yeah yeah you don't need to say that

2628.43 --> 2632.81
every time stallion we know your of

2630.53 --> 2634.6090000000004
blubber and we know you disagree any

2632.81 --> 2637.34
time flat is brought up and the rest is

2634.609 --> 2643.0099999999998
all great yeah we know so difficult to

2637.34 --> 2647.859
get over that one little obstacle don't

2643.01 --> 2647.8590000000004
care sorry I I don't care

2652.369 --> 2655.789
I don't have to tell me you don't

2653.9 --> 2657.4990000000003
disagree with anything just tell me when

2655.789 --> 2662.559
you agree with something or tell me when

2657.499 --> 2668.0789999999997
you disagree with something did don't

2662.559 --> 2668.079
virtual signal to your religion please

2670.359 --> 2675.19
yeah I used the ban button

2690.01 --> 2694.5690000000004
dad more in something more than that

2697.39 --> 2706.299
yeah and he's wrong too you know because

2702.13 --> 2708.569
I do get up in the morning I have been

2706.299 --> 2721.18
for almost half a year

2708.569 --> 2724.869
so you were wrong no he is really a

2721.18 --> 2727.8289999999997
global Morton stalwart he's been in my

2724.869 --> 2727.829
chat for over two years

2759.619 --> 2770.4990000000003
yeah well be careful with that too you

2763.069 --> 2770.499
know the guns

2771.36 --> 2777.15
oh you were paying me a compliment I

2773.49 --> 2779.25
know I know but you had to virt the

2777.15 --> 2780.63
spiritual signal to your religion in

2779.25 --> 2783.48
there as well and I don't appreciate

2780.63 --> 2785.82
that so that kind of undid the value of

2783.48 --> 2787.62
it for me a little you know you don't

2785.82 --> 2789.6000000000004
have to tell me you don't agree with

2787.62 --> 2791.7
everything you know how annoying that is

2789.6 --> 2795.12
to hear that every time somebody tries

2791.7 --> 2798.5699999999997
to pay you a compliment like can't you

2795.12 --> 2811.22
just say it without that part can you do

2798.57 --> 2811.2200000000003
that but yeah I appreciate the sentiment

2818.44 --> 2821.559
[Music]

2823.76 --> 2829.3100000000004
a lot of people do that

2831.28 --> 2834.4790000000003
[Music]

2848.72 --> 2855.56
right well guns have never on this is

2850.88 --> 2858.9500000000003
definitely not Nathan's jet this is not

2855.56 --> 2861.19
a free run range share your pain kind of

2858.95 --> 2861.1899999999996
chat

2869.73 --> 2874.62
all right bit of Adam well there you go

2874.92 --> 2878.099
[Music]

2890.589 --> 2893.16
you

2895.35 --> 2902.3399999999997
what what does that mean can good

2899.04 --> 2903.75
serving your mind you want it to be like

2902.34 --> 2909.32
the Bible you're open to other

2903.75 --> 2909.32
possibilities what what does that mean

2922.809 --> 2926.7090000000003
now but good servant there is not a lot

2925.179 --> 2929.4990000000003
of description in the Bible

2926.709 --> 2930.969
it just drops a couple of element how

2929.499 --> 2936.1789999999996
many times that does it have to be

2930.969 --> 2939.64
surfaced you know talks about well flat

2936.179 --> 2941.89
definitely does tell you it's flat many

2939.64 --> 2943.449
different ways just because of

2941.89 --> 2946.239
observations and all the descriptions

2943.449 --> 2947.589
and it says that the waters are split

2946.239 --> 2951.5190000000002
from the waters and the air in between

2947.589 --> 2953.8289999999997
it talks about a firmament that's it oh

2951.519 --> 2955.9889999999996
yeah the circle of the earth whatever

2953.829 --> 2959.559
the [ __ ] that's supposed to be right

2955.989 --> 2963.009
that's the only thing you got and it

2959.559 --> 2965.789
doesn't mean anything it's just a look

2963.009 --> 2971.529
in the entirety of what should be known

2965.789 --> 2975.88
it's maybe like two five percent it

2971.529 --> 2980.709
tells you practically nothing nothing

2975.88 --> 2983.199
except rough indications flat

2980.709 --> 2985.719
orientation any circle of an earth

2983.199 --> 2989.199
whatever that means water above water

2985.719 --> 2993.2490000000003
below in some way and a firmament

2989.199 --> 2995.829
whatever that means right that's all you

2993.249 --> 2999.9689999999996
got concerning Flat Earth in the Bible

2995.829 --> 3002.099
and Lasser yeah the heavenly bodies are

2999.969 --> 3005.13
like there's probably concerning the

3002.099 --> 3008.88
heavenly bodies the the biggest hints

3005.13 --> 3011.909
about it are in there so you learn more

3008.88 --> 3013.7090000000003
about yeah you can dispel more about the

3011.909 --> 3016.199
actual visuals of the globe of the

3013.709 --> 3020.6589999999997
heavens with the Bible then you can

3016.199 --> 3020.659
figure out the orientation of the realm

3026.68 --> 3033.1699999999996
whoa

3029.5 --> 3041.45
okay for each that is jus just blew my

3033.17 --> 3053.0
mind with that a strong mind a firma

3041.45 --> 3055.5989999999997
meant that's right so again whatever

3053.0 --> 3062.45
that means that's very fascinating

3055.599 --> 3065.63
that's very fascinating so it may if

3062.45 --> 3069.3999999999996
that is where it's derived from then it

3065.63 --> 3072.92
might be entirely metaphorical or

3069.4 --> 3075.859
ethereal and not physical it doesn't

3072.92 --> 3083.96
really say you know when it's wrought

3075.859 --> 3091.22
forth like everybody's here at Horry

3083.96 --> 3093.73
about bumping into the firmament that's

3091.22 --> 3096.77
not obviously like an astral projection

3093.73 --> 3099.44
situation which I think a lot of in the

3096.77 --> 3102.17
book of Enoch is like most of that is

3099.44 --> 3105.079
astral projection memories I'm pretty

3102.17 --> 3106.4900000000002
sure about it and I haven't even read it

3105.079 --> 3108.4700000000003
through it but just from what I heard on

3106.49 --> 3110.6299999999997
the surface and the words the

3108.47 --> 3113.66
descriptions that just seems like an

3110.63 --> 3122.51
astral projection situation you now got

3113.66 --> 3124.8689999999997
out of his body and just yeah registered

3122.51 --> 3124.869
all that

3127.17 --> 3138.12
it's in the description box in the

3131.08 --> 3138.12
YouTube video of flip L it's right there

3155.41 --> 3162.19
all right it's derived from Latin oh

3158.02 --> 3165.22
isn't that weird cuz I'm pretty sure the

3162.19 --> 3179.049
original Bible wasn't Latin was Greek

3165.22 --> 3181.72
and there is the Hebrew version too so

3179.049 --> 3184.93
that doesn't make sense if that word was

3181.72 --> 3188.609
literally derived from Latin then it

3184.93 --> 3188.609
makes no sense that that is the word

3188.91 --> 3200.25
that they're using oh it's just what

3196.93 --> 3200.25
Google says how sure it is

3209.359 --> 3215.27
hmm okay Amanda young thank you check it

3213.18 --> 3215.27
out

3227.03 --> 3239.0400000000004
nice Thank You Amanda young 25 euros

3231.6 --> 3242.13
Roush that's good yeah that's basically

3239.04 --> 3245.97
covered the rent for my storage now

3242.13 --> 3249.0
today I did get I had to pay that like

3245.97 --> 3252.41
three days ago so that's now entirely

3249.0 --> 3252.41
covered thank you so much

3284.29 --> 3290.68
operation fish boil bowl yeah

3291.28 --> 3302.59
oh you know operation Facebook fishbowl

3294.79 --> 3304.75
I really think that I really do this

3302.59 --> 3308.3500000000004
time passes I am more and more convinced

3304.75 --> 3315.7
that the disc snow globe Flat Earth

3308.35 --> 3319.48
model is a is it really was meant as the

3315.7 --> 3324.58
new reification model for the what would

3319.48 --> 3329.55
happen beyond the globe and I think it

3324.58 --> 3329.5499999999997
was actually worked out for a long time

3331.8 --> 3341.52
it's the new trick

3335.4 --> 3341.52
what loop imac holy [ __ ] are you serious

3349.47 --> 3353.24
no you're not serious are you

3358.9 --> 3363.6600000000003
all right well then you can [ __ ] off

3361.39 --> 3363.66
then

3371.58 --> 3378.7999999999997
bird was talking about land beyond the

3373.89 --> 3386.42
poles not exactly he was talking about

3378.8 --> 3393.3
non frozen land somewhere in the south

3386.42 --> 3394.6800000000003
so it could like be inside like yeah it

3393.3 --> 3403.5600000000004
all depends on a matter of perspective

3394.68 --> 3407.85
you know it could be a region inside the

3403.56 --> 3409.83
polar the at the South Pole continent

3407.85 --> 3413.3399999999997
presumed to be a continent in this case

3409.83 --> 3415.89
which in a rectangular looping version

3413.34 --> 3418.86
with the flat globe it would actually be

3415.89 --> 3421.73
a continent just for a record but it

3418.86 --> 3424.83
would be a continent that you could then

3421.73 --> 3433.7400000000002
enter into and then spatially it would

3424.83 --> 3437.49
interconnect to the next realm so the

3433.74 --> 3444.0899999999997
South Pole entrance to the realm beyond

3437.49 --> 3451.1699999999996
that it would be as the North Pole to

3444.09 --> 3453.69
the next segment and who knows it could

3451.17 --> 3456.02
be that what is he noticed he certainly

3453.69 --> 3458.7000000000003
did suggest that it was so vast that

3456.02 --> 3460.95
yeah would definitely suggest almost

3458.7 --> 3462.75
like another space of another realm

3460.95 --> 3464.79
beyond or it could be a very little

3462.75 --> 3468.18
segment you know this is something also

3464.79 --> 3471.06
like it could be quite asymmetrical

3468.18 --> 3476.3999999999996
there could be just a tiny little realm

3471.06 --> 3479.81
a little further to the south and maybe

3476.4 --> 3484.8
that tiny little realm would directly

3479.81 --> 3487.0099999999998
connect to the north so that's also

3484.8 --> 3492.32
possibility you know maybe we have our L

3487.01 --> 3496.7400000000002
our known earth realm and beyond it is a

3492.32 --> 3498.9300000000003
tiny realm that is like in between the

3496.74 --> 3502.6189999999997
North and the South that could be a

3498.93 --> 3504.089
possibility too not so much

3502.619 --> 3505.8900000000003
is beyond the north in the south but

3504.089 --> 3509.5789999999997
still a little that is also a

3505.89 --> 3511.799
possibility like a micro realm in

3509.579 --> 3515.9
between the north and the south on the

3511.799 --> 3522.329
other side I don't know how it works

3515.9 --> 3527.759
this is old yeah based also on reifying

3522.329 --> 3532.6800000000003
what what is again what Admiral Byrd

3527.759 --> 3535.44
said reifying that into yeah refined

3532.68 --> 3537.509
that into truth like assuming that he

3535.44 --> 3539.119
wasn't just lying in spin doctoring

3537.509 --> 3543.96
because that could have been the case

3539.119 --> 3546.329
not exactly an RA a really reliable

3543.96 --> 3551.359
person he was into secret societies [ __ ]

3546.329 --> 3551.3590000000004
so you know it could have been a setup

3552.47 --> 3560.7889999999998
something to throw people off I don't

3555.99 --> 3562.91
know what it is but yeah assuming that

3560.789 --> 3567.029
he was speaking the truth from his own

3562.91 --> 3569.8799999999997
perception yeah it it could mean an

3567.029 --> 3571.65
entire land segment beyond the pole to

3569.88 --> 3574.8900000000003
the south at least or it could mean a

3571.65 --> 3577.4990000000003
tiny segment because he didn't explore

3574.89 --> 3581.8689999999997
the entire realm he didn't he said like

3577.499 --> 3581.8689999999997
they turned back when there was so much

3587.72 --> 3598.5099999999998
I have no idea what that is stats Moretz

3590.5 --> 3598.51
f1 [ __ ] okay but see a turkey later

3601.569 --> 3607.339
no I've not tried anything worked in

3604.819 --> 3609.7889999999998
Tilburg but [ __ ] has been forced on me

3607.339 --> 3609.7889999999998
in the past

3624.72 --> 3628.819
okay he says Moretz sure

3632.15 --> 3637.7000000000003
Birds North Pole diary what no it's

3635.24 --> 3644.0589999999997
South Pole diary went to the South Pole

3637.7 --> 3645.89
not the North Pole right or did I

3644.059 --> 3648.0690000000004
overlook something did he also go to the

3645.89 --> 3648.069
north

3661.41 --> 3670.6299999999997
hmm I don't remember what he said about

3665.049 --> 3673.2
the North Pole at all I just remember

3670.63 --> 3673.2000000000003
about south

3680.91 --> 3684.0789999999997
okay boy it sure

3688.97 --> 3695.6299999999997
North Pole disappeared just a puddle in

3691.25 --> 3698.33
yoshino could it be it is that really

3695.63 --> 3701.36
what happened is it really what turned

3698.33 --> 3703.52
later into the idea of Atlantis the

3701.36 --> 3706.1
island of Atlantis like was it really

3703.52 --> 3711.2
that continent in the North that just

3706.1 --> 3714.02
sank almost like hi Brazil sank in Eric

3711.2 --> 3717.47
the Viking when they sail off to the

3714.02 --> 3720.2599999999998
north beyond the gates of the world

3717.47 --> 3723.56
remember I know if you've seen Eric the

3720.26 --> 3726.7700000000004
Viking you absolutely should absolutely

3723.56 --> 3728.56
as a flat earther I mandate it you must

3726.77 --> 3740.32
watch that movie

3728.56 --> 3743.72
you must Atlantis was America okey-dokey

3740.32 --> 3746.9300000000003
but yeah the Atlantis that is referred

3743.72 --> 3749.0299999999997
to is a thing that sank that's the

3746.93 --> 3750.71
specific about it that's the yeah

3749.03 --> 3753.11
America didn't sink you might have

3750.71 --> 3756.05
noticed it's still there you know

3753.11 --> 3758.57
well the supposed continent and at the

3756.05 --> 3762.1000000000004
North it doesn't seem to be there

3758.57 --> 3769.06
anymore although I do really really

3762.1 --> 3771.23
wonder if it sank then there must be a

3769.06 --> 3775.31
mountain range there under the water

3771.23 --> 3777.32
wouldn't it what's the North Pole ocean

3775.31 --> 3781.97
bottom like I've never seen anything

3777.32 --> 3784.4300000000003
about it I've never seen any indication

3781.97 --> 3787.4599999999996
that there is something real there it's

3784.43 --> 3791.81
almost like they leave it out is it is

3787.46 --> 3793.88
that giant continent that's no longer

3791.81 --> 3797.2999999999997
seems to be there is it there at the

3793.88 --> 3803.4100000000003
bottom is there mountain ranges at the

3797.3 --> 3803.4100000000003
bottom of the yeah the North Pole Ocean

3806.98 --> 3811.66
yeah I know benefit him but that's look

3809.68 --> 3814.1499999999996
that's all the the stuff that has been

3811.66 --> 3817.44
happening ever since in the last 60

3814.15 --> 3819.849
years when the concept kind of forwarded

3817.44 --> 3821.89
you know they say it's everywhere

3819.849 --> 3823.3900000000003
Atlanta's everywhere it's law it sank

3821.89 --> 3826.24
everywhere who could be here it could be

3823.39 --> 3828.04
there Atlanta's everywhere yeah well I

3826.24 --> 3829.9599999999996
have a different theory about it and

3828.04 --> 3836.109
very different and that is that Atlantis

3829.96 --> 3839.41
spans the entire world or almost the

3836.109 --> 3840.97
entire world with opposing groups or

3839.41 --> 3842.7999999999997
maybe coops that I wanted to stay

3840.97 --> 3845.5
outside but it was probably everywhere

3842.8 --> 3852.73
the entire realm and maybe beyond if

3845.5 --> 3855.28
there is such a thing so yeah and there

3852.73 --> 3861.9
is indeed sunken city structures on the

3855.28 --> 3867.19
ocean everywhere Asia Asian oceans

3861.9 --> 3868.599
Europe Europe I don't know about America

3867.19 --> 3878.92
but I wouldn't be surprised if it's

3868.599 --> 3881.29
there as well right so they I think that

3878.92 --> 3883.1800000000003
the ANU is thinking Atlantis like like

3881.29 --> 3884.92
Atlantis is just a freaking City and

3883.18 --> 3891.49
then the rest is just not talked about

3884.92 --> 3894.849
too much they don't play it in the

3891.49 --> 3896.2599999999998
western Rio pro chav it see I think

3894.849 --> 3899.52
they're done playing Atlantis

3896.26 --> 3908.71
significantly because I think it was

3899.52 --> 3911.56
probably a world-spanning Empire set of

3908.71 --> 3915.19
Republic's Great King I don't know how

3911.56 --> 3917.95
it was but it was very wide and hey if

3915.19 --> 3920.41
there was such a thing as a Atlantis

3917.95 --> 3923.2599999999998
city that costed the flawed Cataclysm

3920.41 --> 3929.2
and all that well was that a city or was

3923.26 --> 3932.05
that basically a machine that plant is

3929.2 --> 3933.79
built like an attempt to for example get

3932.05 --> 3938.1090000000004
complete control over D what maybe it

3933.79 --> 3941.2
was like a very early harp system

3938.109 --> 3943.21
and they were actually experimenting on

3941.2 --> 3947.23
a vos skill and they couldn't control it

3943.21 --> 3949.96
too much because they didn't have like a

3947.23 --> 3952.21
lot of close-up sensory technologies to

3949.96 --> 3954.73
figure and map everything out now they

3952.21 --> 3956.92
just went by the functions of what they

3954.73 --> 3958.66
discovered probably and they just

3956.92 --> 3962.279
experiment and it might have yeah

3958.66 --> 3965.259
then caused the flood I don't think

3962.279 --> 3968.319
Atlantis was a city I would if more

3965.259 --> 3970.079
likely it was just a giant device just

3968.319 --> 3977.859
like the pyramids are giant energy

3970.079 --> 3980.9100000000003
generating devices and maybe the

3977.859 --> 3984.16
pyramids were in a stratospheric

3980.91 --> 3988.589
electricity way even powering that

3984.16 --> 3992.16
device remotely from all over the world

3988.589 --> 3992.16
like batteries

3996.16 --> 4001.3489999999997
beyond yea their normal function like

3999.16 --> 4005.16
electrifying the air surrounding it

4001.349 --> 4007.4700000000003
potentially feeding giants so that they

4005.16 --> 4010.3799999999997
would not collapse into their own weight

4007.47 --> 4013.5589999999997
the really large ones that also have

4010.38 --> 4015.75
helped transport you know that's one of

4013.559 --> 4018.329
my personal theories that the pyramids

4015.75 --> 4020.73
and very large giants were intricately

4018.329 --> 4023.4900000000002
linked it was the technology that

4020.73 --> 4025.109
allowed them to grow as large as they

4023.49 --> 4029.8489999999997
did without collapsing under their own

4025.109 --> 4031.8289999999997
weight by electrically lowering their

4029.849 --> 4034.829
weight electrostatically

4031.829 --> 4036.27
and maybe even electrically feeding

4034.829 --> 4038.7000000000003
their cells so they wouldn't have to

4036.27 --> 4042.44
engorge themselves constantly just to

4038.7 --> 4047.43
stay alive I think that is a thing I

4042.44 --> 4051.93
envision that and I think there's a

4047.43 --> 4053.64
strong possibility of this I don't know

4051.93 --> 4055.68
how large the Giants would have been

4053.64 --> 4059.21
involved in it but in my view they could

4055.68 --> 4059.21
have been 20 meters tall at least

4065.67 --> 4078.339
yes project retribution yes I do but

4073.41 --> 4083.17
that's the thing you know I am engaging

4078.339 --> 4085.27
as a speculator as a theorist as a well

4083.17 --> 4086.98
even a science fiction writer that's how

4085.27 --> 4093.099
you can approach it it's kind of my

4086.98 --> 4095.47
safety net and but yeah if at some point

4093.099 --> 4099.400000000001
there's going to be too much weight if

4095.47 --> 4102.4
they conclude that our wins talk has

4099.4 --> 4104.7699999999995
tipped the scale somehow into not being

4102.4 --> 4107.44
able to complete the finances for some

4104.77 --> 4109.660000000001
freaking space project or whatever they

4107.44 --> 4112.599999999999
want to do then they might actually come

4109.66 --> 4114.5199999999995
after me in a more direct way I don't

4112.6 --> 4118.359
know if I have that much influence but

4114.52 --> 4121.179
yeah I fully expect to be apt to meet a

4118.359 --> 4124.179
very terrible end and I don't care

4121.179 --> 4126.67
because I'm gonna go all the [ __ ] way

4124.179 --> 4130.65
I've already had so much freaking mind

4126.67 --> 4130.65
torture that I just don't care anymore

4131.069 --> 4140.549
I'm gonna review everything I possibly

4134.589 --> 4140.549
can beyond where even people want to

4158.739 --> 4164.799
no benefit Tesla did not discover free

4161.71 --> 4169.54
energy he figured out what energy is and

4164.799 --> 4173.14
that yeah how much is involved and how

4169.54 --> 4175.2699999999995
much energy exists naturally within the

4173.14 --> 4178.509
realm and that can be tapped into it's

4175.27 --> 4181.450000000001
not free though there is no free energy

4178.509 --> 4186.67
it doesn't exist it's always coming from

4181.45 --> 4188.0199999999995
somewhere from the electric ether if you

4186.67 --> 4190.39
have enough energy

4188.02 --> 4192.219
tapping devices tapping energy from the

4190.39 --> 4196.96
high stratosphere everywhere it's

4192.219 --> 4199.39
literally going to detract from the

4196.96 --> 4203.92
entire energy field you gotta realize

4199.39 --> 4205.9890000000005
that it's not free it's not coming out

4203.92 --> 4209.41
of another dimension that has unlimited

4205.989 --> 4213.599999999999
energy adding more energy to us no it's

4209.41 --> 4213.599999999999
coming from within the realm everything

4213.96 --> 4221.28
it's probably even tapping from the same

4217.12 --> 4224.95
sources that provide energy to the Sun

4221.28 --> 4228.13
that cause the like manifestation of the

4224.95 --> 4231.07
globe of the heaven and then from that

4228.13 --> 4233.650000000001
perspective I've even philosophized like

4231.07 --> 4236.41
science fiction thinking that yeah if

4233.65 --> 4241.089999999999
there's just too many electricity being

4236.41 --> 4245.29
tapped in in Tesla fashion from the

4241.09 --> 4249.13
earth from the air then it could

4245.29 --> 4252.16
actually cause the globe of the heavens

4249.13 --> 4253.2
to dim significantly including the Sun

4252.16 --> 4256.09
itself

4253.2 --> 4261.75
but yeah there's only one way to find

4256.09 --> 4261.75
out if we even want to find that out

4269.659 --> 4275.42
rivers puffer flea ya know it only does

4273.26 --> 4280.219
because of the conditions the world are

4275.42 --> 4283.34
in if the Sun goes out not saying that

4280.219 --> 4286.19
it will and never absolutely not that it

4283.34 --> 4290.06
were in a permanent fashion then

4286.19 --> 4292.849999999999
everything completely changes things

4290.06 --> 4296.360000000001
will not flow naturally no temperature

4292.85 --> 4299.030000000001
will change so dramatically eventually

4296.36 --> 4302.96
that nothing will be like it is and the

4299.03 --> 4306.5199999999995
electricity will not be there it's so

4302.96 --> 4306.52
intricate linked

4312.28 --> 4318.37
am I in my opinion and Tesla did know

4315.25 --> 4320.44
that you know his Tesla tire ideas it

4318.37 --> 4322.87
didn't just create electricity out of

4320.44 --> 4326.589999999999
absolutely nothing no he had to actually

4322.87 --> 4329.71
generate electricity and then put it in

4326.59 --> 4333.1900000000005
there in order to do what it does create

4329.71 --> 4335.26
the high-tension field and that that

4333.19 --> 4337.75
wasn't generated out of nothing it was

4335.26 --> 4341.95
just extremely efficient

4337.75 --> 4346.02
transair transmittable energy it's not

4341.95 --> 4350.62
free it has to be generated didn't see

4346.02 --> 4353.320000000001
it drives me nuts the amount of people

4350.62 --> 4356.29
that just perpetuate that [ __ ]

4353.32 --> 4358.78
legend about free energy and limited

4356.29 --> 4362.35
energy like oh this is we could use that

4358.78 --> 4365.62
to go to the Stars because they live no

4362.35 --> 4369.43
there is no unlimited energy never was

4365.62 --> 4372.25
there's more energy than we could ever

4369.43 --> 4379.4800000000005
handle though there's no one limited

4372.25 --> 4385.87
anything the oil is not running out

4379.48 --> 4390.129999999999
benefit and ridiculous it's not running

4385.87 --> 4391.84
out oil wells refill themselves in a

4390.13 --> 4396.46
relatively short time span it's

4391.84 --> 4401.8
unlimited practically unlimited it's lit

4396.46 --> 4404.02
yeah the amount of oil that is coming

4401.8 --> 4407.47
out of the ground is literally dependent

4404.02 --> 4412.620000000001
on the amount of rock in the freakin

4407.47 --> 4412.62
realm okay there's a lot of that

4418.84 --> 4424.189
[Music]

4420.669 --> 4427.09
no George Sanford I'm not your dynamo

4424.189 --> 4435.110000000001
thank you very much

4427.09 --> 4435.110000000001
[Music]

4438.099 --> 4451.900000000001
oh right yeah you did say that bit of

4440.619 --> 4453.82
venom right okay yeah the messed up

4451.9 --> 4456.73
thing about it is that since we have

4453.82 --> 4458.86
started oil drilling if we don't use

4456.73 --> 4463.54
that all it's literally gonna spout out

4458.86 --> 4465.79
of the ground and create tar pits that's

4463.54 --> 4474.55
what it will do if you stop using the

4465.79 --> 4478.96
oil now had a maken it's not fossil fuel

4474.55 --> 4482.110000000001
and earth loot is not funny now it's a

4478.96 --> 4486.07
biotic oil it's literally bacteria under

4482.11 --> 4490.389
pressure conditions transforming literal

4486.07 --> 4492.989
rock into raw abiotic oil that's what

4490.389 --> 4492.9890000000005
oil is

4493.96 --> 4497.06
[Music]

4510.88 --> 4518.409000000001
I don't think that oil has any kind of

4513.79 --> 4521.59
function to make motions of the earth

4518.409 --> 4523.42
more flexible or something that's a

4521.59 --> 4526.21
weird idea that it could have some kind

4523.42 --> 4530.7390000000005
of mechanical function within the realms

4526.21 --> 4532.21
I don't know with tectonic plates but

4530.739 --> 4533.949
that really doesn't make any sense

4532.21 --> 4538.179
because I don't think that all the oil

4533.949 --> 4542.82
is at the tectonic regions or maybe I'm

4538.179 --> 4542.82
mistaken I'm pretty sure they're not

4544.6 --> 4547.649
[Music]

4553.539 --> 4562.489
is that weird well because can you prove

4558.499 --> 4564.199
that it has a mechanical function like

4562.489 --> 4566.678999999999
in the Scent where is where is the oil

4564.199 --> 4569.509999999999
where is though is there like a map of

4566.679 --> 4572.389
literally scan into the earth somehow

4569.51 --> 4575.329000000001
performed like where all the oil is hey

4572.389 --> 4577.579
maybe maybe you could figure out like

4575.329 --> 4579.919
here everywhere is oil yeah that makes

4577.579 --> 4582.709
it very blatantly obvious that it is

4579.919 --> 4585.26
some kind of lubricant for a mechanical

4582.709 --> 4587.51
motion of these earth in a slow way

4585.26 --> 4592.88
somehow but you gotta actually show that

4587.51 --> 4597.499
on a map hey well what else is oil for

4592.88 --> 4601.4890000000005
the atom we can if not motion we use it

4597.499 --> 4604.249
in machines for smooth motion to prevent

4601.489 --> 4606.228999999999
friction so that means motion well

4604.249 --> 4608.389
there's only one motion that I know of

4606.229 --> 4610.189
on the earth of the earth itself and

4608.389 --> 4612.399
that is tectonic activity whatever that

4610.189 --> 4612.399
may be

4619.16 --> 4624.74
what does that mean oils founded lower

4621.5 --> 4625.58
levels and fossil fuel but fossil fuels

4624.74 --> 4627.62
don't exist

4625.58 --> 4630.41
it's just the name they get it it's oil

4627.62 --> 4633.49
it's all oil it's all a biotic oil

4630.41 --> 4633.49
there's no fossil oil

4638.9 --> 4645.32
unless you want to suggest that the

4642.35 --> 4648.08
fossils were all petrified and then the

4645.32 --> 4650.8099999999995
abiotic or bacteria $8 per troph I'd

4648.08 --> 4653.17
fossils in order to make oil in that

4650.81 --> 4653.17
case

4668.989 --> 4680.959999999999
I know black goo right I see that ever

4679.4 --> 4689.509999999999
absolutely not getting anywhere with

4680.96 --> 4693.4890000000005
that there are nothing's okay all right

4689.51 --> 4699.7300000000005
so you say your oil does not have a

4693.489 --> 4699.73
realm inherent function then

4703.94 --> 4712.28
so could it then be considered to be

4707.77 --> 4714.59
just as soil bacteria that it's

4712.28 --> 4719.179999999999
literally like a fungus eating the rock

4714.59 --> 4722.29
like it's the biggest parasite of the

4719.18 --> 4725.6
rock itself of the entire earth like a

4722.29 --> 4727.969
the rotting bacteria when something's

4725.6 --> 4732.860000000001
dead a lot of happens transformation

4727.969 --> 4734.78
processes chemical processes it could be

4732.86 --> 4736.429999999999
perceived like that it does feel like it

4734.78 --> 4741.739
if there's literally just bacteria

4736.43 --> 4746.4800000000005
eating away the material you know I've

4741.739 --> 4750.009999999999
even like not happily envisioned that if

4746.48 --> 4752.75
time is allowed to continue on like for

4750.01 --> 4756.08
extremely long times that eventually

4752.75 --> 4758.6
would could end up on a giant oil puddle

4756.08 --> 4763.43
because all the rock would all be eaten

4758.6 --> 4765.17
away and turned into oil because there

4763.43 --> 4769.85
doesn't seem to be anything stopping the

4765.17 --> 4772.6900000000005
process may be a lack of pressure so

4769.85 --> 4772.6900000000005
there's a lot of that

4780.42 --> 4787.71
did when to think about it like that one

4784.59 --> 4790.9800000000005
could even speculate that if oil wells

4787.71 --> 4793.65
are big enough like not the well made to

4790.98 --> 4800.87
get there but the oil spot is big enough

4793.65 --> 4805.17
and growing that it could actually break

4800.87 --> 4808.489
potentially tectonic plates is that what

4805.17 --> 4808.4890000000005
it's for to break the plates

4824.1 --> 4831.59
yeah yeah right to guts of nephron RMP

4826.68 --> 4831.59
yeah they'd oil story is just ridiculous

4835.82 --> 4841.58
and there's been like tar pits which is

4839.33 --> 4843.95
what happens with oil when it just is

4841.58 --> 4848.99
not extracted those have been around

4843.95 --> 4852.4
forever tar pits have always been there

4848.99 --> 4852.4
always existed

4876.56 --> 4882.330000000001
well George Sanford what you're talking

4879.09 --> 4886.4400000000005
about is they they basically pump a

4882.33 --> 4894.57
solvent in it to let it let the pressure

4886.44 --> 4896.849999999999
go through more easily it's all about

4894.57 --> 4899.07
pressure mechanics and like making sure

4896.85 --> 4902.58
that the prep that that it'll naturally

4899.07 --> 4913.61
start to pump itself out and then you

4902.58 --> 4913.61
just open the tap do that Adam Aiken

4920.63 --> 4925.42
ah fossil fuel theory busted nice

4935.68 --> 4938.52
what

4939.6 --> 4946.47
okay that's weird in the link you said

4942.84 --> 4952.17
sent they do suggest that oil even is

4946.47 --> 4953.990000000001
formed in magma what it's kind of

4952.17 --> 4956.99
presuming the molten iron core I think

4953.99 --> 4956.99
weird

4982.36 --> 4987.549999999999
okay doesn't actually elaborate on that

4985.0 --> 4989.23
picture but yeah interesting articles

4987.55 --> 4992.34
lots of data in here a good one

4989.23 --> 4992.339999999999
thanks for that Adam

5007.86 --> 5012.889999999999
rotting of their chappathis it's so

5010.29 --> 5012.89
ridiculous

5015.62 --> 5020.49
you know if that would have even been a

5018.15 --> 5027.33
thing the idea that it's rotting plants

5020.49 --> 5029.76
and all that then why is biofuel not

5027.33 --> 5032.07
being rotten they don't do that they

5029.76 --> 5034.8
don't ferment

5032.07 --> 5038.639999999999
no they just squeeze it and then you got

5034.8 --> 5046.02
the oil they don't do that

5038.64 --> 5048.150000000001
why because that doesn't exist like I've

5046.02 --> 5050.490000000001
pretty sure that what actually happens

5048.15 --> 5054.69
with rotten plants even under pressure

5050.49 --> 5058.139999999999
it turns into I call that Vin

5054.69 --> 5061.259999999999
just typical swamps have a lot of it

5058.14 --> 5064.59
it's just stacked up on stacked upon

5061.26 --> 5069.24
layers of plants and it it doesn't turn

5064.59 --> 5072.42
into oil although what comes out is like

5069.24 --> 5074.19
this weird stuff that even in the old

5072.42 --> 5076.65
days in the Netherlands was your turf

5074.19 --> 5079.32
they used it to burn on the stove

5076.65 --> 5082.139999999999
because it's almost like coal just

5079.32 --> 5085.38
really old compacted plants I think that

5082.14 --> 5089.700000000001
old compacted plants over time are much

5085.38 --> 5090.59
more likely to turn into coal not into

5089.7 --> 5095.33
oil

5090.59 --> 5095.33
Pete's a rights called Pete right

5101.33 --> 5104.51
[Music]

5104.739 --> 5108.5199999999995
yeah we got a lot of that in the

5106.989 --> 5111.16
Netherlands by the way who re used to it

5108.52 --> 5115.21
wants to giant swamp remember we don't

5111.16 --> 5119.219
have oil wells here not a single one so

5115.21 --> 5119.219
yeah it's not the same thing

5141.89 --> 5145.06
[Music]

5155.48 --> 5158.2
hmm

5169.19 --> 5171.879999999999
right

5172.93 --> 5181.27
Gideon's sick come on don't be like that

5190.57 --> 5193.889
why did you do that

5201.09 --> 5208.8
just I don't know why you guys even have

5203.909 --> 5211.619
these impulses just stop turning the

5208.8 --> 5218.4800000000005
water into a swamp don't don't

5211.619 --> 5218.48
jettison your internal garbage please

5227.52 --> 5233.88
yeah sure so I don't know what that is

5237.42 --> 5242.91
yeah I'm not getting into that right now

5240.15 --> 5245.589999999999
there's all kinds of ideas on how to

5242.91 --> 5247.45
basically tap into the energy of the

5245.59 --> 5252.1900000000005
realm and utilize it mechanically it's

5247.45 --> 5257.13
not free it's not free it's just coming

5252.19 --> 5257.129999999999
from another source not free

5281.06 --> 5285.620000000001
hmm

5283.4 --> 5288.37
pay and George Sandford that's

5285.62 --> 5288.37
interesting

5300.469 --> 5307.16
a device that releases hydrogen from

5303.68 --> 5309.469
metal right so it basically uses

5307.16 --> 5311.83
chemical a chemical reaction that's not

5309.469 --> 5311.83
free

5331.459 --> 5334.15
right

5366.56 --> 5376.820000000001
right I think I'm gonna run out to show

5373.22 --> 5383.12
guys a half hour and getting kind of

5376.82 --> 5385.4
hungry I'm kind of drained also lots of

5383.12 --> 5389.42
subjects it's good to go through it all

5385.4 --> 5392.15
again but I think I am gonna run out so

5389.42 --> 5393.38
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

5392.15 --> 5396.049999999999
like to show I thought it was pretty

5393.38 --> 5398.150000000001
good if you did like it then please

5396.05 --> 5399.650000000001
don't forget to Rogen's it up and if you

5398.15 --> 5401.57
haven't already subscribed to my channel

5399.65 --> 5403.5199999999995
and it's a bail notification so you know

5401.57 --> 5405.5599999999995
when I'm going live which is normally

5403.52 --> 5408.17
2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every day
