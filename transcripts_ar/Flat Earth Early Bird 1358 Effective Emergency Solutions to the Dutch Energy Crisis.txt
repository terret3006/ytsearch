6.01 --> 37.31
[Music]

60.0 --> 64.0
good

61.359 --> 66.32000000000001
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

64.0 --> 68.72
number 1358

66.32 --> 70.79899999999999
i'm your host arwyn and before we start

68.72 --> 73.52
the show please don't forget to share it

70.799 --> 75.759
on any platform you deem fit and if you

73.52 --> 77.92
haven't already subscribe to my channel

75.759 --> 80.4
hit the bell notification so you know

77.92 --> 82.799
when i'm going live which is normally 1

80.4 --> 84.96000000000001
pm amsterdam time and weekdays and 2 pm

82.799 --> 87.68
amsterdam time in the weekend and please

84.96 --> 90.15899999999999
also do support me through the paypal

87.68 --> 91.28
patreon super chat and membership system

90.159 --> 93.52000000000001
join button

91.28 --> 97.6
they'll be much appreciated

93.52 --> 98.84
and yeah you all know the score

97.6 --> 101.83999999999999
i need

98.84 --> 104.56
it right

101.84 --> 107.52000000000001
so whether today has been

104.56 --> 110.88
actually kind of rainy right now there's

107.52 --> 111.84
a bit of clear sky up there

110.88 --> 114.64
but

111.84 --> 116.0
it's also just some really big clouds

114.64 --> 118.719
here and there

116.0 --> 118.719
like over there

119.04 --> 124.56
for which quite a few

121.68 --> 126.32000000000001
quite a bit of rain comes

124.56 --> 129.84
so i did also get doused when i was

126.32 --> 129.84
doing groceries this morning

130.16 --> 133.32999999999998
[Music]

135.04 --> 138.56
but yeah with the sun out it's kind of

136.8 --> 140.08
nice

138.56 --> 143.28
and

140.08 --> 144.31900000000002
moist does kind of evaporate pretty

143.28 --> 146.64000000000001
quickly

144.319 --> 149.92
so it's i think it's like 18 degrees

146.64 --> 149.92
maybe a little bit more now

150.319 --> 155.67999999999998
there's this constant wind which is not

153.04 --> 158.48
cold it's kind of nice

155.68 --> 158.48000000000002
so yeah

160.239 --> 164.8
but it's already starting to feel like

162.319 --> 164.79999999999998
autumn

166.4 --> 172.8
hello pj c net first in chat

169.36 --> 172.8
good to see you clutch

174.16 --> 178.4
wasn't like

176.0 --> 180.0
waiting for you to post

178.4 --> 182.56
right yeah i'm a little late because

180.0 --> 185.56
yeah i had an appointment a social

182.56 --> 185.56
worker

186.08 --> 190.31900000000002
and that was like

187.68 --> 191.59900000000002
up to like five minutes to one so i had

190.319 --> 193.28
to hurry

191.599 --> 195.35999999999999
hurry up

193.28 --> 198.159
back and prepare and that takes some

195.36 --> 200.48000000000002
time so yeah i'm late

198.159 --> 200.48
uh

204.159 --> 207.879
low turret 306.

224.4 --> 229.12
right yeah i got a i got a little

227.519 --> 231.76
bonus today

229.12 --> 233.68
in the mail consolidation price but it

231.76 --> 236.239
was it's nice

233.68 --> 238.4
hoping to see steamy traveler

236.239 --> 243.12
because

238.4 --> 243.12
i think i got my t-shirt in

250.959 --> 258.959
so i'm waiting him for to appear in chat

255.28 --> 258.959
so you can check out the new t-shirt

263.44 --> 266.479
so that should be fun

267.36 --> 271.84000000000003
right so yeah yesterday show oh

272.639 --> 279.40000000000003
it was dramatic as expected

275.919 --> 279.4
over the top

287.199 --> 291.6
but yeah doable

289.28 --> 291.59999999999997
i mean

291.759 --> 295.68
that's what it is

293.68 --> 298.24
but yeah i had a conversation today so

295.68 --> 299.28000000000003
with the social worker and

298.24 --> 302.40000000000003
his

299.28 --> 304.15999999999997
attitude was kind of pessimistic

302.4 --> 307.59999999999997
but he basically said like yeah there's

304.16 --> 307.6
really nothing you can do about it

308.08 --> 311.84
and apparently like

314.32 --> 319.28
here it goes like

316.56 --> 322.24
he's happy that i'm at least

319.28 --> 324.4
realizing the weight of the situation

322.24 --> 326.72
and he was kind of like pessimistic

324.4 --> 328.88
about other people that seem to just

326.72 --> 328.88000000000005
like

329.36 --> 333.68
try to ignore it

332.32 --> 335.59999999999997
and even

333.68 --> 337.759
justify it

335.6 --> 341.199
so

337.759 --> 343.68
that's kind of worrisome to hear about

341.199 --> 345.6
i think my camera might just freeze up

343.68 --> 347.68
any second

345.6 --> 351.36
hold on

347.68 --> 351.36
having a weird glitch again

351.68 --> 353.84000000000003
right

356.88 --> 360.8
right and i was even like already

358.8 --> 362.96000000000004
getting into what i wouldn't want to get

360.8 --> 362.96000000000004
in

363.28 --> 367.84
on the show today

364.8 --> 370.24
the title which is yeah if i'm gonna go

367.84 --> 372.88
ape [ __ ] over some crisis i'm not just

370.24 --> 374.08
gonna leave it there i will then as i

372.88 --> 376.319
always do

374.08 --> 378.88
dedicate like the next show to the

376.319 --> 382.0
solution to all that

378.88 --> 383.759
right and they discussed a bit of that

382.0 --> 387.36
even

383.759 --> 387.36
my social worker and

388.16 --> 392.08000000000004
he said that basically it isn't even

390.639 --> 394.40000000000003
about

392.08 --> 395.84
the lack of energy sources really it is

394.4 --> 398.479
all about just

395.84 --> 398.479
a siege

398.96 --> 403.19899999999996
so that's really crazy to hear from

401.12 --> 404.639
somebody else from a very calm

403.199 --> 406.56
perspective

404.639 --> 408.16
pretty much exactly the type of things

406.56 --> 410.56
that i've been saying yesterday all

408.16 --> 414.36
raged up dude what the [ __ ] is wrong

410.56 --> 414.36
with this [ __ ] webcam

422.56 --> 425.919
black shirt today yeah

426.08 --> 431.039
no it was a bit too cold to just go in a

428.4 --> 431.039
white shirt

431.12 --> 436.16
you're not frozen no i am not frozen i

434.0 --> 438.4
know but it just keeps this stupid

436.16 --> 442.12
glitch

438.4 --> 442.12
doesn't make any sense

450.639 --> 456.24
it's not phrasing it's just giving that

453.44 --> 457.84
the distortion thing

456.24 --> 459.84000000000003
it seems to stop now i apparently have

457.84 --> 462.56
to just tap it on

459.84 --> 462.56
onto the head

462.72 --> 467.36
it might be wiring

464.4 --> 467.35999999999996
whatever anyway

467.759 --> 472.8
because i was thinking as a energy

470.24 --> 472.8
solution

473.28 --> 476.84
could be

475.12 --> 480.4
hydrogen

476.84 --> 482.56
engines basically a hydrogen

480.4 --> 482.56
uh

482.8 --> 486.56
motoric

484.16 --> 487.59900000000005
power generators

486.56 --> 489.36
because

487.599 --> 491.919
yeah

489.36 --> 494.40000000000003
that can be done pretty efficiently and

491.919 --> 497.44
the real the thing you need

494.4 --> 498.87899999999996
is water now if we're not short on

497.44 --> 500.879
something

498.879 --> 503.28000000000003
some type of resource here in the

500.879 --> 505.52000000000004
netherlands it's water

503.28 --> 506.479
so if you could

505.52 --> 508.0
convert

506.479 --> 508.96
engines and there should be plenty

508.0 --> 510.639
around

508.96 --> 512.24
you can convert like

510.639 --> 515.279
car engines

512.24 --> 517.519
gasoline engines to hydrogen engines

515.279 --> 519.279
that is doable i i don't know how to do

517.519 --> 521.599
it but i've heard that that is possible

519.279 --> 523.919
with a whole range of motors

521.599 --> 527.2
then you can basically have a room

523.919 --> 529.8389999999999
somewhere installed with these motors

527.2 --> 532.88
as a makeshift

529.839 --> 532.8800000000001
power generator

533.6 --> 538.16
i mean the the tools are there

536.56 --> 540.399
all you need is the mastery the

538.16 --> 542.399
engineering put it together

540.399 --> 546.32
and then you can have like a back up

542.399 --> 549.6
power generator for like a city

546.32 --> 552.32
just have these buildings

549.6 --> 552.32
that do that

552.48 --> 556.88
so that was my idea but yeah when i

555.04 --> 558.56
shared that idea with my social worker

556.88 --> 560.72
he said like yeah yeah they could do

558.56 --> 562.64
that but they're not doing it

560.72 --> 564.399
nobody else can do that

562.64 --> 565.519
because they they got us all cornered

564.399 --> 568.0
off

565.519 --> 570.9590000000001
like legally and

568.0 --> 574.68
contractually financially

570.959 --> 574.68
and through media

577.839 --> 582.8800000000001
so the siege is already clamped on

580.24 --> 586.16
pretty hard as it is

582.88 --> 589.399
which is quite a grim 4 look

586.16 --> 589.399
to me

595.76 --> 600.399
so we'll see what happens

598.08 --> 603.399
anyway hello gaining wisdom

600.399 --> 603.399
enthusiasts

615.68 --> 620.079
all right so there was no flatter debate

618.32 --> 620.88
yesterday

620.079 --> 622.959
but

620.88 --> 625.68
the five hour

622.959 --> 629.3599999999999
flatter debates

625.68 --> 631.279
show from what is it last

629.36 --> 632.48
thursday

631.279 --> 637.0
was playing

632.48 --> 637.0
was interesting to watch that back

651.36 --> 657.839
yeah pjc i think that that was real

654.48 --> 657.839
or even is real

658.399 --> 662.72
but that's not it's not the same thing i

661.12 --> 667.68
don't know exactly what it is but it's

662.72 --> 670.64
not about hydrogen it's literally water

667.68 --> 672.079
i don't really understand it

670.64 --> 675.12
it's some really

672.079 --> 676.3199999999999
sophisticated engineering

675.12 --> 678.32
but

676.32 --> 681.0400000000001
what i'm talking about is just pure

678.32 --> 682.88
hydrogen engines

681.04 --> 684.16
it's some something different so it's

682.88 --> 686.399
not with

684.16 --> 689.04
gasoline right because we're in trouble

686.399 --> 690.24
with gasoline and with all electric

689.04 --> 692.24
sources

690.24 --> 694.8
but there is water

692.24 --> 696.8
well for as long as well water treatment

694.8 --> 699.279
plants and

696.8 --> 701.519
water distribution plants keep running

699.279 --> 703.12
and all that as long as the pumps can

701.519 --> 705.6
can hold up

703.12 --> 707.68
right all we need is electricity to keep

705.6 --> 711.2
that going and then we have water so

707.68 --> 714.3199999999999
there might definitely be

711.2 --> 715.279
an emergency power solution

714.32 --> 718.0
in

715.279 --> 721.8389999999999
the creation of hydrogen and the using

718.0 --> 724.959
it of in engines to create electricity

721.839 --> 727.36
to provide for everything

724.959 --> 730.2399999999999
or as much as possible

727.36 --> 733.6800000000001
right and you don't even need to build

730.24 --> 736.0
like oh we need special industrial grade

733.68 --> 738.079
super engines i mean it's not like

736.0 --> 741.04
you're building a permanent power plant

738.079 --> 743.8389999999999
or anything that could be done

741.04 --> 745.8389999999999
right but do we really need to like that

743.839 --> 748.1600000000001
takes too much time anyway this is about

745.839 --> 751.12
an emergency solution all you need is a

748.16 --> 751.12
building room

752.0 --> 755.76
and these engines and like yeah

754.16 --> 758.16
ventilation because there's going to be

755.76 --> 760.16
a lot of moisture

758.16 --> 762.24
right so you have to take that all into

760.16 --> 764.3199999999999
account

762.24 --> 766.24
but you could make it

764.32 --> 768.0790000000001
you could technically make it very

766.24 --> 770.32
quickly

768.079 --> 773.8389999999999
as long as there's enough engineers

770.32 --> 773.839
working on it

774.0 --> 778.079
that actually know what they're doing

775.92 --> 779.8389999999999
right hey steamy traveler i was waiting

778.079 --> 781.68
for you

779.839 --> 785.24
look what i got

781.68 --> 785.2399999999999
in the mail today

797.76 --> 802.959
hydrogen has been considered still it's

799.92 --> 805.279
apparently difficult safety

802.959 --> 807.68
leakage yeah that well that's one happy

805.279 --> 810.16
jesus that's if you literally store

807.68 --> 811.76
hydrogen in tanks

810.16 --> 812.48
right

811.76 --> 814.88
but

812.48 --> 816.399
if you can actually

814.88 --> 818.16
minimize

816.399 --> 819.36
the path

818.16 --> 821.8389999999999
between

819.36 --> 825.04
the electrolysis in order to create the

821.839 --> 827.6
hydrogen and the actual engine

825.04 --> 830.079
using the hydrogen if you can basically

827.6 --> 832.32
put them very close together

830.079 --> 834.56
then

832.32 --> 838.1600000000001
you could definitely engineer it that

834.56 --> 840.88
there simply will not be

838.16 --> 843.12
possible any type of hydrogen buildup in

840.88 --> 844.959
order to pose a risk like that

843.12 --> 848.24
right because the risk only comes when

844.959 --> 850.3199999999999
it's large quantities that are stored

848.24 --> 852.639
under under pressure

850.32 --> 853.9200000000001
right

852.639 --> 854.839
but if you

853.92 --> 857.68
make the

854.839 --> 859.0400000000001
electrolysis system

857.68 --> 863.12
its output

859.04 --> 866.56
almost directly go into the engine

863.12 --> 866.5600000000001
then how is it going to build up

869.04 --> 871.8389999999999
right

874.8 --> 878.959
unless yeah there's a leak

876.56 --> 881.76
and then it's just gonna puff it out

878.959 --> 883.76
right well yeah there should be systems

881.76 --> 886.0
to basically

883.76 --> 888.24
ensure some level of safety for that

886.0 --> 888.24
right

891.76 --> 895.4399999999999
the only real danger with hydrogen was

893.76 --> 897.92
always like

895.44 --> 900.24
oh generating it in a separate plant and

897.92 --> 903.279
then putting it in tankers

900.24 --> 904.5600000000001
then using the tankers in cars or

903.279 --> 906.0
whatever

904.56 --> 907.8389999999999
to burn it up

906.0 --> 910.56
well that's risky because then you have

907.839 --> 911.7600000000001
to store it like that

910.56 --> 913.8389999999999
i mean

911.76 --> 918.16
storing just regular

913.839 --> 920.8800000000001
lpg is much safer than storing hydrogen

918.16 --> 924.639
so but you can bypass that problem

920.88 --> 928.16
by literally integrating the systems

924.639 --> 930.88
by having the energy generation right

928.16 --> 933.8389999999999
next to the electrolysis machine then

930.88 --> 937.12
you can even use its power

933.839 --> 937.12
to directly feed

937.44 --> 941.0400000000001
the electrolysis machine

939.68 --> 943.12
right

941.04 --> 946.0
all you have to do is a steady influx of

943.12 --> 948.88
water wow what what's going on with my

946.0 --> 948.88
freaking camera

966.8 --> 972.16
hydrogen based but dude professor phil

969.12 --> 975.839
bell we've had hydrogen based buses

972.16 --> 975.8389999999999
in the netherlands in the 90s

976.24 --> 982.199
and then they just discontinued it

978.0 --> 982.199
because of these supposed risks

993.92 --> 996.56
all right

994.839 --> 1000.24
anyway

996.56 --> 1000.2399999999999
i'm gonna unbox this thing

1001.839 --> 1006.12
really curious what it looks like

1022.08 --> 1027.799
[Music]

1023.6 --> 1027.799
i really taped it up

1049.76 --> 1052.76
god

1065.919 --> 1071.1200000000001
i got a i got a letter

1069.12 --> 1073.84
from steamy traveler cool

1071.12 --> 1075.9189999999999
[Music]

1073.84 --> 1078.72
august

1075.919 --> 1082.96
2020 hey irwin hope the t-shirt fits

1078.72 --> 1082.96
okay enjoy steamy traveler

1083.039 --> 1087.52
also some home he has also some homemade

1085.679 --> 1089.52
soaps by my wife

1087.52 --> 1091.039
oh that's so sweet

1089.52 --> 1092.84
thank you so much man i really

1091.039 --> 1096.16
appreciate it i love

1092.84 --> 1096.1599999999999
this awesome

1098.0 --> 1101.039
oh that smells nice

1104.32 --> 1109.4399999999998
oh that smells pretty intense

1107.36 --> 1113.1999999999998
huh

1109.44 --> 1113.2
homemade soap that is so cool

1115.6 --> 1119.9599999999998
see i'm gonna check that out

1123.36 --> 1125.6789999999999
huh

1128.799 --> 1131.44
look at that

1132.08 --> 1135.6399999999999
it's very creative

1139.12 --> 1144.4399999999998
yeah that smells really nice thank you

1141.28 --> 1144.44
so much

1158.799 --> 1163.32
that certainly brightened my day

1174.32 --> 1179.799
i have no physicality assumption bias

1180.16 --> 1184.919
oh yeah and the sun is holographic

1192.48 --> 1197.039
yeah a non-local hologram to be more

1194.559 --> 1197.039
precise

1200.799 --> 1206.799
very cool i'm gonna put it on

1204.72 --> 1210.6000000000001
it's good to have a t-shirt that doesn't

1206.799 --> 1210.6
have a hole in it

1227.919 --> 1231.5200000000002
looks like it's the right size

1233.679 --> 1238.72
all right now it smells no it smells

1235.6 --> 1238.7199999999998
totally like that so

1240.559 --> 1244.32
yeah

1242.64 --> 1247.64
yeah this

1244.32 --> 1247.6399999999999
fits great

1255.28 --> 1258.28
cool

1260.64 --> 1263.699
[Music]

1263.919 --> 1268.0
so my hanger is right in front of the

1266.559 --> 1271.48
other

1268.0 --> 1271.48
from that picture

1284.32 --> 1289.559
yeah thank you so much steventrow that's

1286.32 --> 1289.559
really awesome

1310.559 --> 1316.76
in size is just perfect

1313.76 --> 1316.76
great

1323.66 --> 1327.28
[Music]

1325.36 --> 1329.36
print is a little smaller than i

1327.28 --> 1330.24
expected i thought it was would be a bit

1329.36 --> 1333.84
bigger

1330.24 --> 1333.84
but at school it's not a problem

1356.799 --> 1361.4
might fit better without the other shirt

1362.32 --> 1368.6
no it fits fine but i also just need to

1365.28 --> 1368.6
wash it

1374.4 --> 1378.039
yeah that's fine

1397.84 --> 1402.36
yeah

1398.799 --> 1402.36
so that was nice

1407.84 --> 1410.84
hmm

1416.24 --> 1420.84
right anyway hold on

1441.84 --> 1446.72
it is pretty epic to get packages from

1444.159 --> 1446.72
followers

1449.36 --> 1454.1589999999999
i got the magnets even though that was

1451.6 --> 1456.8799999999999
kind of a bit of a crazy person

1454.159 --> 1459.44
i got the tarot deck from seeking style

1456.88 --> 1461.1200000000001
water awesome

1459.44 --> 1465.8400000000001
really creative

1461.12 --> 1465.84
and yeah the t-shirt that we bake yeah

1466.88 --> 1470.64
i gave you the text and you put together

1469.44 --> 1472.799
the

1470.64 --> 1475.039
the design for that and even the

1472.799 --> 1478.8799999999999
suggestion of making a

1475.039 --> 1478.8799999999999
t-shirt so that yeah very cool

1480.799 --> 1484.559
it's really interesting to see my symbol

1483.12 --> 1487.1999999999998
on this shirt

1484.559 --> 1488.08
it's just

1487.2 --> 1491.0800000000002
kind of

1488.08 --> 1491.08
bizarre

1510.799 --> 1514.279
right anyways

1517.19 --> 1520.289
[Music]

1528.38 --> 1533.69
[Music]

1545.679 --> 1548.679
so

1571.039 --> 1575.84
yeah

1573.039 --> 1575.84
hey lsg

1576.159 --> 1582.279
check out my new shirt i just got in the

1578.32 --> 1582.279
mail from steemit traveler

1592.559 --> 1597.32
oh yeah my hair is in front of it

1630.159 --> 1633.159
so

1641.2 --> 1648.24
right yeah steemit traveler it is by the

1643.919 --> 1649.76
way it is just a white print though

1648.24 --> 1651.1200000000001
i thought it was going to be a color

1649.76 --> 1653.279
print

1651.12 --> 1656.32
because then it would have been

1653.279 --> 1660.32
quite surreal but i think yeah this

1656.32 --> 1662.799
is just an effective white print so

1660.32 --> 1665.9189999999999
pretty cool

1662.799 --> 1668.0
and it's probably gonna stay good better

1665.919 --> 1669.039
because color printed shirts tend to

1668.0 --> 1672.72
like

1669.039 --> 1676.8799999999999
degrade over time is my experience

1672.72 --> 1676.88
so i have made like t-shirts before

1676.96 --> 1681.159
that's like a long time ago

1682.0 --> 1686.08
and they like

1683.44 --> 1688.96
the print just started to buckle like

1686.08 --> 1690.96
after a year of wearing it

1688.96 --> 1693.279
anyway

1690.96 --> 1695.279
what does the shirt say hello ralph

1693.279 --> 1698.32
rodriguez

1695.279 --> 1698.32
shirt says

1700.88 --> 1706.3200000000002
yes light in the way that is so

1703.679 --> 1706.3200000000002
intricate

1708.559 --> 1713.12
sun is a non-local hologram

1715.52 --> 1717.84
and

1718.799 --> 1723.96
i have no physicality assumption bias

1730.159 --> 1733.159
so

1783.919 --> 1788.3990000000001
i really wonder what would happen if i

1785.6 --> 1790.0
just go around in this shirt i mean at

1788.399 --> 1793.7199999999998
some point somebody's gonna ask

1790.0 --> 1793.72
something about it

1804.08 --> 1808.12
down for our wind merch

1830.72 --> 1836.76
you want the rage win bat oh my god

1833.76 --> 1836.76
really

1850.0 --> 1853.76
no i don't think i'm gonna sell or like

1852.399 --> 1856.7199999999998
i'm gonna

1853.76 --> 1858.559
make such merchandise

1856.72 --> 1862.519
this is

1858.559 --> 1862.519
that's a terrible idea

1864.64 --> 1870.2
i don't actually want to become like a

1866.799 --> 1870.2
war merchant

1901.039 --> 1905.519
all right yeah kumo virus that is one of

1903.44 --> 1908.0
the more sensible things i've ever heard

1905.519 --> 1910.32
you say so

1908.0 --> 1910.32
yeah

1916.159 --> 1920.96
but i don't think it's gonna work though

1920.0 --> 1923.039
because

1920.96 --> 1924.559
the only way you could test it is by

1923.039 --> 1926.64
blotting it out

1924.559 --> 1929.039
holographically it

1926.64 --> 1931.6000000000001
that does seems like uh

1929.039 --> 1935.32
might be risky

1931.6 --> 1935.32
so anyway

1954.96 --> 1959.3990000000001
[Music]

1956.399 --> 1959.399
right

1963.44 --> 1968.64
what is a holograph

1966.32 --> 1968.6399999999999
what

1972.72 --> 1979.159
it's it's a hologram

1974.799 --> 1979.1589999999999
and its nature is holographic

1995.76 --> 1998.76
hmm

2010.0 --> 2017.96
would that be the same as projection

2013.12 --> 2017.9599999999998
no because projection is the action

2018.159 --> 2020.48
right

2022.0 --> 2025.84
so the projector

2024.32 --> 2028.0
projects

2025.84 --> 2031.279
then the hologram

2028.0 --> 2031.279
is projected

2031.44 --> 2036.88
the hologram does not project

2034.159 --> 2037.919
it is being projected is the subject of

2036.88 --> 2041.96
it

2037.919 --> 2041.96
anyway this is semantics

2052.24 --> 2057.2
right so yeah

2054.32 --> 2057.2000000000003
get hungry here

2057.52 --> 2061.839
man this thing does really smell like so

2067.44 --> 2074.2000000000003
not surprising if you're gonna ship it

2069.52 --> 2074.2
with soap in the same box

2090.639 --> 2095.76
oh you're with

2092.48 --> 2098.159
you're with me on that huh

2095.76 --> 2098.159
all right

2100.72 --> 2104.48
that's pretty cool

2103.599 --> 2106.32
i mean

2104.48 --> 2108.48
the problem is is that from that point

2106.32 --> 2109.599
on there's not really a lot you can

2108.48 --> 2112.079
actually

2109.599 --> 2113.119
build towards because it's just like

2112.079 --> 2114.2400000000002
yeah

2113.119 --> 2117.04
they're

2114.24 --> 2119.68
a really bizarre mysterious hologram and

2117.04 --> 2119.68
arguably

2120.88 --> 2125.52
the most important factor even in life

2123.2 --> 2128.24
existing here

2125.52 --> 2131.599
but that's about it

2128.24 --> 2134.8799999999997
because you can't really

2131.599 --> 2136.4
approach it now you can't

2134.88 --> 2138.8
but you can still attempt to do an

2136.4 --> 2142.0
icarus and then disprove that assertion

2138.8 --> 2142.88
that it is holographic

2142.0 --> 2146.56
but

2142.88 --> 2150.48
i doubt that's actually gonna happen

2146.56 --> 2150.48
the challenge has been set though

2154.0 --> 2157.839
but what you can do with it is just

2155.92 --> 2160.079
dispel

2157.839 --> 2161.92
all this physicality assumption bias

2160.079 --> 2164.48
based

2161.92 --> 2166.88
science fiction about it this fantasy

2164.48 --> 2168.56
about them being objects and or

2166.88 --> 2170.96
something's changing with them and now

2168.56 --> 2173.359
we're all

2170.96 --> 2175.44
gonna have a disaster or something right

2173.359 --> 2178.88
that sort of thing

2175.44 --> 2180.96
is very easily let go once you realize

2178.88 --> 2183.119
they're holographic

2180.96 --> 2187.119
they're not objects

2183.119 --> 2190.359
and they're integrated into the system

2187.119 --> 2190.359
of the realm

2202.72 --> 2207.7599999999998
so that makes two people

2204.96 --> 2207.76
no there's more

2208.4 --> 2213.44
my dad's with it too

2211.44 --> 2215.599
and i think there's other people out

2213.44 --> 2217.599
there too i think the lsg

2215.599 --> 2220.2400000000002
is also on it

2217.599 --> 2220.2400000000002
it's just that

2221.44 --> 2225.839
it's not something you're going to be

2223.28 --> 2227.28
easily eager for to just throw out there

2225.839 --> 2229.2799999999997
because it's so

2227.28 --> 2232.88
out there

2229.28 --> 2232.88
compared to the norm

2236.48 --> 2241.4
and even arguably distracted

2249.28 --> 2252.88
i'm gonna

2250.56 --> 2255.359
put an illuminati cross on in the oven

2252.88 --> 2258.76
because i'm like really getting hungry

2255.359 --> 2258.7599999999998
be right back

2335.04 --> 2340.68
huh

2337.359 --> 2340.68
what's this

2347.44 --> 2350.44
wow

2357.68 --> 2361.52
yeah that was a good call that clutch

2359.68 --> 2363.9199999999996
what the [ __ ]

2361.52 --> 2366.16
how dare you guys support me how dare

2363.92 --> 2366.16
you

2367.119 --> 2371.119
i'm so obviously disturbed

2372.72 --> 2375.5989999999997
to go live

2377.04 --> 2383.0
yes according to this guy you should all

2379.359 --> 2383.0
just let me die

2383.839 --> 2386.24
okay

2389.44 --> 2394.599
i think he's really just jealous to be

2391.599 --> 2394.599
honest

2425.92 --> 2428.7200000000003
oh yes

2431.119 --> 2436.0
it's interesting how people that

2433.2 --> 2440.16
allegedly believe the heliocentric

2436.0 --> 2440.16
cosmology always have to ask us

2440.4 --> 2445.6800000000003
how would you prove that it is physical

2446.079 --> 2449.7200000000003
they're so lazy

2475.839 --> 2480.48
i mean i couldn't fire his nose

2478.64 --> 2483.359
he's gonna be put on the spot then he

2480.48 --> 2485.599
will just lay out exactly how we know

2483.359 --> 2488.16
it's physical you know he would because

2485.599 --> 2490.4
he knows those arguments he's just not

2488.16 --> 2493.8799999999997
saying and just telling us oh how would

2490.4 --> 2493.88
you do it

2501.92 --> 2504.92
uh

2512.16 --> 2515.7599999999998
all right

2513.119 --> 2515.76
anyway

2517.2 --> 2522.7999999999997
i'm getting bogged down by my hunger

2520.319 --> 2525.04
i mean these inner food stuff is awesome

2522.8 --> 2527.04
and all but

2525.04 --> 2530.04
it doesn't make you necessarily less

2527.04 --> 2530.04
hungry

2538.56 --> 2542.48
a giant mirror would be cool

2545.68 --> 2551.44
yes of course that's how you're going to

2547.68 --> 2554.3999999999996
prove the moon is real by going

2551.44 --> 2556.7200000000003
to the rock moon surface and installing

2554.4 --> 2559.2000000000003
a giant mirror there

2556.72 --> 2562.0
well how about just

2559.2 --> 2562.839
going there first

2562.0 --> 2566.56
how

2562.839 --> 2569.04
about actually going there and then

2566.56 --> 2571.44
showing as you're approaching it getting

2569.04 --> 2574.24
bigger and

2571.44 --> 2574.2400000000002
then arriving

2576.0 --> 2580.64
right but especially the angular size

2578.16 --> 2583.96
increase during the travel is is kind of

2580.64 --> 2583.96
a big deal

2593.839 --> 2599.44
right i don't think it's happening

2596.56 --> 2603.68
nasa have showed us

2599.44 --> 2607.44
supposed sites of the moon's surface

2603.68 --> 2609.9199999999996
but that's edited in you can't actually

2607.44 --> 2609.92
see that

2610.24 --> 2615.52
it took the features

2612.64 --> 2617.5989999999997
of the hologram of the moon

2615.52 --> 2621.92
and then just like oh

2617.599 --> 2623.2000000000003
what if we zoomed in on that oh look

2621.92 --> 2624.48
yeah it's all

2623.2 --> 2626.319
pixely

2624.48 --> 2627.839
it's gonna be

2626.319 --> 2630.0
and then they're like oh yeah we could

2627.839 --> 2632.7999999999997
just

2630.0 --> 2635.92
like plant a scene here we're just gonna

2632.8 --> 2638.8
say oh this is going to be our new they

2635.92 --> 2641.04
basically sandbox the moon

2638.8 --> 2643.3590000000004
that's what they did they sandboxed the

2641.04 --> 2643.359
moon

2643.839 --> 2647.599
took the actual hologram

2646.4 --> 2649.44
photos

2647.599 --> 2650.56
probably good quality

2649.44 --> 2652.319
then just

2650.56 --> 2655.7599999999998
in a computer zoomed in on it and

2652.319 --> 2655.7599999999998
started editing [ __ ] in

2658.56 --> 2664.96
what's that with mars i'm not sure

2662.72 --> 2668.48
the moon yeah with the moon probably too

2664.96 --> 2668.48
i think they did that too with the moon

2671.44 --> 2676.079
but it's all

2673.04 --> 2678.4
obviously like edited you can't actually

2676.079 --> 2680.4
see anything it's just a hologram and

2678.4 --> 2681.92
there's suggestions of some kind of

2680.4 --> 2684.56
physical nature

2681.92 --> 2688.64
through this weird shadow play

2684.56 --> 2688.64
holographic shadow play but

2689.28 --> 2694.6400000000003
you can't get further detail by just

2692.0 --> 2698.0
zooming in

2694.64 --> 2699.839
if it was a really large object though

2698.0 --> 2705.079
then you would

2699.839 --> 2705.0789999999997
get more detail when you zoom in

2705.28 --> 2710.44
but it's not really a large object it's

2707.119 --> 2710.44
just a hologram

2741.04 --> 2744.4
yeah i know pgc net

2745.2 --> 2750.0789999999997
but look

2746.64 --> 2752.24
just the crappy models and all that

2750.079 --> 2755.6800000000003
is not the only problem they have the

2752.24 --> 2758.9599999999996
problem is is that they have no

2755.68 --> 2763.7599999999998
theatrical solutions

2758.96 --> 2765.68
to certain elements about heliocentric

2763.76 --> 2769.92
universe

2765.68 --> 2769.9199999999996
they don't know how to show

2770.72 --> 2775.52
yeah and this is like not just oh you do

2773.119 --> 2778.0
this that that no it's never even been

2775.52 --> 2780.0
shown in cinema in science fiction

2778.0 --> 2782.88
cinema even right

2780.0 --> 2784.96
because it's a unresolvable

2782.88 --> 2787.599
theatrical problem

2784.96 --> 2788.96
they can't show you

2787.599 --> 2790.6400000000003
a ship

2788.96 --> 2792.4
or a rocket

2790.64 --> 2794.24
launching from the ground and then

2792.4 --> 2797.04
follow it

2794.24 --> 2800.0789999999997
and then see beyond the fisheye lens of

2797.04 --> 2801.599
the supposed horizon and then

2800.079 --> 2804.1600000000003
they can't

2801.599 --> 2806.4
get it further than that it's impossible

2804.16 --> 2809.52
to transition

2806.4 --> 2809.52
from ground level

2810.0 --> 2813.599
to

2810.72 --> 2815.9199999999996
having that ball suddenly

2813.599 --> 2818.2400000000002
turn into a ball in the distance as it's

2815.92 --> 2820.56
still going it's never

2818.24 --> 2821.7599999999998
been done

2820.56 --> 2823.2
why

2821.76 --> 2826.079
because

2823.2 --> 2828.0
it's too far it's too far with the

2826.079 --> 2830.6400000000003
suspense of disbelief

2828.0 --> 2832.079
and it literally snaps people out of it

2830.64 --> 2833.68
if they would attempt it and that's why

2832.079 --> 2834.96
they never show that that's why it's

2833.68 --> 2836.319
always just

2834.96 --> 2838.88
one scene

2836.319 --> 2840.0
next scene

2838.88 --> 2841.76
right

2840.0 --> 2844.16
ground scene

2841.76 --> 2846.7200000000003
going up pool through the atmosphere

2844.16 --> 2848.8799999999997
scene and then like oh oh oh look next

2846.72 --> 2851.2799999999997
scene oh we're in orbit now oh now it's

2848.88 --> 2853.6800000000003
a planet in the background

2851.28 --> 2856.48
always everything

2853.68 --> 2858.96
star trek star wars all of it

2856.48 --> 2861.68
firefly in it and they had some real

2858.96 --> 2864.4
good attempts

2861.68 --> 2866.0
in this sort of thing

2864.4 --> 2867.599
firefly series

2866.0 --> 2869.119
right

2867.599 --> 2872.2400000000002
they can't do it

2869.119 --> 2873.04
not because they cannot literally do

2872.24 --> 2875.5989999999997
that

2873.04 --> 2877.599
with visual trickery they can't do it

2875.599 --> 2880.88
because it would always snap people out

2877.599 --> 2882.8
of it because it's a theatrical problem

2880.88 --> 2885.2000000000003
they can't actually show you the

2882.8 --> 2887.6800000000003
transition

2885.2 --> 2890.3999999999996
even in cgi because that would

2887.68 --> 2892.48
immediately like

2890.4 --> 2895.6800000000003
probably people might that are really

2892.48 --> 2897.52
deep into it like kids might get like a

2895.68 --> 2900.3999999999996
spasm or something

2897.52 --> 2903.44
because it's really jarring

2900.4 --> 2905.04
if you'd see that it would like snap you

2903.44 --> 2906.88
out of it

2905.04 --> 2909.2
out of the suspense of disbelief of the

2906.88 --> 2911.359
whole thing and that's why i believe

2909.2 --> 2913.2
they've never shown that

2911.359 --> 2915.839
in like

2913.2 --> 2915.839
a hundred years

2918.079 --> 2923.04
like it's never even been done in cinema

2920.64 --> 2926.839
which yeah cinema definitely precedes

2923.04 --> 2930.72
the official space activities

2926.839 --> 2930.72
right so there's that

2941.44 --> 2945.52
firefly was awesome yeah it was

2943.359 --> 2948.0789999999997
definitely still is

2945.52 --> 2951.079
i mean that thing ages

2948.079 --> 2951.079
magnificently

2978.96 --> 2981.28
anyway

2981.599 --> 2984.7200000000003
not something that i said something that

2983.44 --> 2987.2000000000003
i was thinking about i'm not going to

2984.72 --> 2987.2
talk about

2988.48 --> 2995.48
i have to prove the crazy story

2992.48 --> 2995.48
what

3001.119 --> 3004.76
the other alternatives

3008.24 --> 3013.7999999999997
but

3009.119 --> 3013.8
you've already had the alternatives

3014.96 --> 3018.16
you'll find them in the housekeeping

3016.48 --> 3020.559
quest it's just it's a realm it's

3018.16 --> 3022.3999999999996
enclosed it's the surface is

3020.559 --> 3024.4
geometrically flat

3022.4 --> 3026.559
in its orientation in relation to every

3024.4 --> 3030.319
other part

3026.559 --> 3031.8390000000004
it may or may not have barriers

3030.319 --> 3033.839
or

3031.839 --> 3037.2
looping space

3033.839 --> 3038.48
it definitely will have a cut-off point

3037.2 --> 3041.7599999999998
at the top

3038.48 --> 3042.72
with either a barrier

3041.76 --> 3044.6400000000003
or

3042.72 --> 3047.2
a dome

3044.64 --> 3048.72
i think it's a barrier but that is that

3047.2 --> 3052.0
is it

3048.72 --> 3054.72
that's the alternative it's right there

3052.0 --> 3057.76
all celestials are holographic inside

3054.72 --> 3060.3999999999996
very mysterious as to why

3057.76 --> 3060.4
it's there

3061.119 --> 3063.92
it's just there

3064.48 --> 3068.079
and that's it

3066.0 --> 3068.88
and there might be much more land out

3068.079 --> 3072.2400000000002
there

3068.88 --> 3072.2400000000002
beyond our known maps

3074.0 --> 3077.319
that's it

3082.079 --> 3087.52
outside

3083.359 --> 3087.52
nothing there is no outside the dough

3089.359 --> 3094.0
space does not exist

3091.52 --> 3096.17
outside the dough

3094.0 --> 3097.599
there's no volume for matter to

3096.17 --> 3100.319
[Music]

3097.599 --> 3102.559
yeah interact with

3100.319 --> 3105.44
is nothing

3102.559 --> 3109.3590000000004
the amount of available space

3105.44 --> 3112.4
within physical existence is finite

3109.359 --> 3112.4
it would have to be

3117.839 --> 3121.2799999999997
no need for a dome then yeah well that's

3119.92 --> 3124.28
the point

3121.28 --> 3124.28
right

3124.96 --> 3130.079
if there's an end of space out there

3127.52 --> 3130.88
no more volume for matter to be go into

3130.079 --> 3133.44
then

3130.88 --> 3135.359
that would be perceived to us

3133.44 --> 3136.7200000000003
like a barrier

3135.359 --> 3138.5589999999997
because nothing can go in there it's

3136.72 --> 3140.5589999999997
like a super hard solid

3138.559 --> 3143.2000000000003
surface to us

3140.559 --> 3145.28
impenetrable because literally matter

3143.2 --> 3148.0
cannot move into it because there's no

3145.28 --> 3150.6400000000003
volume to move into

3148.0 --> 3152.48
right none space is what i call that

3150.64 --> 3155.839
right there's space

3152.48 --> 3158.48
where material can exist where light can

3155.839 --> 3162.88
be absorbed

3158.48 --> 3162.88
etc etc and then there's none space

3165.44 --> 3169.119
whereby the way light would not be

3167.04 --> 3171.52
perceived because there literally is no

3169.119 --> 3175.04
matter in order to reflect any light

3171.52 --> 3175.04
that would go outside

3175.359 --> 3179.359
so yeah you might actually shine a torch

3178.48 --> 3180.88
light

3179.359 --> 3182.96
like into

3180.88 --> 3185.359
non-space

3182.96 --> 3188.559
and you will literally it will seem like

3185.359 --> 3188.5589999999997
you're shining through it

3188.72 --> 3192.64
but

3189.52 --> 3194.96
there's literally nothing behind it

3192.64 --> 3196.24
it will seem like there's transparency

3194.96 --> 3198.079
behind it

3196.24 --> 3200.8799999999997
but there's literally nothing there

3198.079 --> 3205.28
there's no volume there it's just

3200.88 --> 3207.28
absolute void impenetrable absolute void

3205.28 --> 3209.44
it's going to be very freaky to

3207.28 --> 3213.8
encounter that if that could be

3209.44 --> 3213.8
happening at some point right

3225.839 --> 3231.7599999999998
sounds lazy of god no god does

3228.8 --> 3231.76
everything for a

3234.839 --> 3243.04
reason i mean he's literally

3238.96 --> 3243.04
the origin of design

3243.76 --> 3248.6400000000003
all things we've conceived

3246.319 --> 3251.839
are mere reflections of

3248.64 --> 3253.52
his original

3251.839 --> 3255.68
creation

3253.52 --> 3255.68
so

3256.8 --> 3261.3590000000004
everything is the way it is for a reason

3261.599 --> 3267.28
and to say that it's lazy or not good

3264.72 --> 3269.839
enough is simply because you just don't

3267.28 --> 3269.8390000000004
understand

3270.72 --> 3278.64
i think that concerning god that's not a

3275.04 --> 3280.24
it's not an overblown thing to say

3278.64 --> 3284.319
because there's always

3280.24 --> 3286.16
nothing happens without an exact reason

3284.319 --> 3289.599
that doesn't mean that you can actually

3286.16 --> 3292.96
be able to catch on to that reason

3289.599 --> 3294.799
as a mere mortal spirit

3292.96 --> 3296.48
anyway

3294.799 --> 3299.04
you don't understand why god created the

3296.48 --> 3299.04
devil i

3304.839 --> 3312.0
do without it would be nothing would be

3308.079 --> 3312.0
no change there would be no purpose

3313.599 --> 3316.92
no challenge

3329.599 --> 3333.599
what happens if i put my hand that you

3332.48 --> 3336.4
can't

3333.599 --> 3340.1600000000003
it's absolutely impenetrable it's not

3336.4 --> 3340.1600000000003
solid it's impenetrable

3342.4 --> 3347.28
yeah we'll block your hand

3344.4 --> 3350.1600000000003
just be like oh yeah just put my hand

3347.28 --> 3350.88
through solid concrete

3350.16 --> 3353.68
no

3350.88 --> 3353.6800000000003
that doesn't work

3357.839 --> 3362.4
right you might be able to see something

3360.88 --> 3364.7200000000003
through it like let's just say

3362.4 --> 3366.799
theoretically this is extremely unlikely

3364.72 --> 3370.64
that there would be

3366.799 --> 3374.839
a block of no space or a pillar

3370.64 --> 3377.5989999999997
then you might shine the light through

3374.839 --> 3378.96
that and still receive it on the other

3377.599 --> 3380.559
end

3378.96 --> 3382.4
right because the only thing that

3380.559 --> 3384.2400000000002
obstructs light is matter and there is

3382.4 --> 3386.7200000000003
literally none so light would be able to

3384.24 --> 3390.9199999999996
just go through

3386.72 --> 3390.9199999999996
but nothing else would

3394.24 --> 3399.2799999999997
right but there are no such thing

3396.72 --> 3402.16
like a pillar

3399.28 --> 3404.559
of non-space

3402.16 --> 3407.5589999999997
that's yeah that's highly science

3404.559 --> 3407.559
fiction

3418.559 --> 3421.76
all right

3419.52 --> 3424.48
but yeah critical factor of known space

3421.76 --> 3426.7200000000003
is that you cannot move

3424.48 --> 3428.319
non-space is immovable

3426.72 --> 3431.9199999999996
and impenetrable

3428.319 --> 3434.079
it is a set thing it is a euclidean set

3431.92 --> 3436.48
thing

3434.079 --> 3438.88
so you can't have like oh i have a ball

3436.48 --> 3441.44
of knot in space and i'm gonna move it

3438.88 --> 3443.76
no no if there would be such a thing it

3441.44 --> 3446.079
would be absolutely impenetrable and

3443.76 --> 3448.88
absolutely immovable

3446.079 --> 3451.2000000000003
like no matter what

3448.88 --> 3453.52
like even if like all the weight and all

3451.2 --> 3458.359
the strain of the entire realm would

3453.52 --> 3458.359
rest upon it it would not budge

3469.839 --> 3472.839
right

3486.96 --> 3491.76
how can something be inventory but not

3489.599 --> 3493.52
be made of matter

3491.76 --> 3495.44
well non-space

3493.52 --> 3498.92
aries 106.

3495.44 --> 3498.92
that's the point

3509.2 --> 3516.2799999999997
besides there is no matter that is

3511.28 --> 3516.28
absolutely impenetrable it doesn't exist

3516.799 --> 3523.44
might be very tough to do it

3519.68 --> 3523.44
but it's not impossible

3524.799 --> 3529.599
i mean even the hardest materials that

3527.2 --> 3531.2799999999997
exist do break and

3529.599 --> 3532.7200000000003
like

3531.28 --> 3536.0
shave

3532.72 --> 3538.48
pieces off grinds to dust eventually

3536.0 --> 3538.48
everything

3539.04 --> 3542.319
but not non-space because there's

3540.64 --> 3545.319
literally nothing there

3542.319 --> 3545.319
literally

3564.559 --> 3569.44
you've never interacted with it yeah no

3566.72 --> 3573.319
[ __ ] sherlock aries 106. that's why it

3569.44 --> 3573.319
is a concept

3573.599 --> 3578.559
it's effectively science fiction i'm not

3575.92 --> 3581.2000000000003
claiming that oh i bumped into some

3578.559 --> 3584.2400000000002
non-space one time dude

3581.2 --> 3585.5989999999997
i seen the non-space guard just come

3584.24 --> 3587.04
over me

3585.599 --> 3589.599
it's in my shed

3587.04 --> 3590.96
i got it i got a piece of non-space here

3589.599 --> 3593.839
man

3590.96 --> 3593.839
gotta buy this

3594.4 --> 3597.28
yeah

3595.28 --> 3598.4
that's gonna be some nonsense wizard

3597.28 --> 3601.8390000000004
story

3598.4 --> 3601.839
if you hear somebody say that

3630.559 --> 3636.0
plasma barrier for reactors what

3639.599 --> 3642.599
how

3660.96 --> 3663.28
hmm

3663.52 --> 3668.24
anyway it seems like my camera has

3664.96 --> 3668.2400000000002
finally stopped glitching

3669.599 --> 3674.92
and i'm gonna get my illuminati class on

3721.839 --> 3725.72
hey flatter sage

3733.039 --> 3736.96
what

3734.96 --> 3739.359
i don't see any

3736.96 --> 3741.839
parentheses around your name flatter

3739.359 --> 3741.839
sage

3755.839 --> 3759.599
yeah george sanford i think that's

3757.52 --> 3762.079
probably just a bunch of science fiction

3759.599 --> 3762.079
stories

3762.559 --> 3766.76
there's a lot of those going around

3780.319 --> 3784.24
man made duality

3790.4 --> 3795.88
okay that's an interesting perspective

3792.48 --> 3795.88
kumu virus

3799.44 --> 3804.48
but i do think it does actually matter

3802.319 --> 3808.799
to god even though

3804.48 --> 3810.88
good and evil and or the way that we've

3808.799 --> 3812.96
incorporated it

3810.88 --> 3815.44
as humans

3812.96 --> 3818.48
that might be

3815.44 --> 3821.119
just yeah just that what you said

3818.48 --> 3821.119
man-made

3822.319 --> 3825.839
but god it does matter

3828.48 --> 3836.839
i mean god definitely cares

3832.0 --> 3839.92
and the way things pop out to you in

3836.839 --> 3842.64
reality definitely proves that there is

3839.92 --> 3842.64
a difference

3843.76 --> 3849.039
it's not just some good and evil is not

3845.599 --> 3850.319
something that man just made up

3849.039 --> 3851.3590000000004
it's just a

3850.319 --> 3854.96
the way

3851.359 --> 3854.96
our spirits crystallized

3855.2 --> 3859.1189999999997
the pathways that it can take

3860.079 --> 3867.2400000000002
but everything that happens to you

3862.0 --> 3867.24
pretty much depends on on these choices

3874.24 --> 3880.359
okay i'm gonna bite into some

3877.359 --> 3880.359
hungry

3912.799 --> 3918.88
no akuma virus that that was my point it

3915.68 --> 3920.8799999999997
does not depend on the religion

3918.88 --> 3924.319
religion is based

3920.88 --> 3927.359
upon the spiritual culture

3924.319 --> 3927.359
not the other way around

3929.2 --> 3932.0789999999997
all these rituals all these things all

3930.96 --> 3936.28
these

3932.079 --> 3936.28
philosophies had to form

3937.44 --> 3942.799
and that then

3939.44 --> 3946.359
converted into a relation a religion

3942.799 --> 3946.359
through traditionalism

3961.359 --> 3964.5989999999997
thank you

3993.28 --> 3998.4
your religion doesn't have stuff a

3995.839 --> 4001.64
normal really what the [ __ ] does that

3998.4 --> 4001.64
even mean

4023.2 --> 4025.52
oh

4026.799 --> 4030.4
oh okay cool five routes yeah i'll check

4029.68 --> 4034.44
it

4030.4 --> 4034.44
i could certainly use it

4035.359 --> 4039.119
hope you are all enjoying the show

4037.359 --> 4041.2
i hope i'm

4039.119 --> 4044.7200000000003
less

4041.2 --> 4049.24
strained than i was yesterday

4044.72 --> 4049.24
in order for you to enjoy the show

4063.359 --> 4066.839
oh come on

4076.799 --> 4082.64
oh jesus that took like a minute to get

4079.359 --> 4082.64
through oh god

4084.16 --> 4087.839
hmm

4085.76 --> 4091.6400000000003
yes thank you fiber out for the paypal i

4087.839 --> 4091.64
really appreciate that

4097.199 --> 4100.5199999999995
that's nice

4106.88 --> 4111.1990000000005
all right

4108.88 --> 4111.1990000000005
yeah

4112.799 --> 4117.04
so yeah again back to the original

4114.96 --> 4118.64
situation with the energy crisis here

4117.04 --> 4121.359
and all that

4118.64 --> 4124.0
my rent got heightened by pretty

4121.359 --> 4126.2390000000005
significant amount but

4124.0 --> 4128.88
there is likely to be some kind of

4126.239 --> 4131.04
compensation for welfare

4128.88 --> 4134.64
users like myself

4131.04 --> 4134.64
only use the absolute minimum

4136.0 --> 4141.12
right because otherwise like people are

4138.239 --> 4145.199
literally just gonna start starving and

4141.12 --> 4146.88
like crime's gonna happen if they don't

4145.199 --> 4149.12
so

4146.88 --> 4152.0
i don't know if it's gonna be sufficient

4149.12 --> 4153.2789999999995
i'm probably almost sufficient or i

4152.0 --> 4155.04
don't know

4153.279 --> 4156.719
but uh

4155.04 --> 4158.239
yeah i'm definitely gonna keep needing

4156.719 --> 4161.839
the support

4158.239 --> 4161.839
on a regular basis

4163.759 --> 4168.0
so i really appreciate it every time

4165.679 --> 4169.759
somebody supports me like fiber oats

4168.0 --> 4172.159
just did

4169.759 --> 4175.52
thank you very much it keeps me going of

4172.159 --> 4178.4
course also like awesome actions like

4175.52 --> 4181.92
sending me a t-shirt like this

4178.4 --> 4185.3589999999995
also really keeps me going

4181.92 --> 4187.04
even if just for just having a new shirt

4185.359 --> 4190.08
because all my shirts

4187.04 --> 4190.08
are like old

4190.719 --> 4194.52
so that was perfect

4208.0 --> 4212.719
i can't wrap my round around something

4209.92 --> 4212.719
made of nothing

4213.28 --> 4218.32
well there is a way that might make it a

4215.28 --> 4221.12
bit easier to help you imagine it

4218.32 --> 4222.799999999999
if you know the game boulder dash

4221.12 --> 4226.32
do you

4222.8 --> 4226.320000000001
it's an old old game

4226.88 --> 4230.719
you might have bumped into it i played

4228.88 --> 4234.159000000001
it on the commodore 64. might have been

4230.719 --> 4236.64
on other computers too

4234.159 --> 4237.36
i think it was on pc too

4236.64 --> 4241.04
but

4237.36 --> 4241.04
yeah the commodore one was the best

4242.0 --> 4248.08
well in there you literally have like

4245.36 --> 4250.08
you have a firmament in that game

4248.08 --> 4251.5199999999995
literally

4250.08 --> 4254.96
you have

4251.52 --> 4258.56
the play field which is 2d

4254.96 --> 4260.08
play field with like a hard border every

4258.56 --> 4261.76
time

4260.08 --> 4264.0
where you can even see that border it

4261.76 --> 4265.12
doesn't matter but outside of it is

4264.0 --> 4267.04
nothing

4265.12 --> 4270.4
it's black like that's the end of the

4267.04 --> 4271.6
level now imagine a piece of outside of

4270.4 --> 4272.799999999999
the level

4271.6 --> 4274.64
being

4272.8 --> 4276.8
by a glitch or something because that

4274.64 --> 4279.6
normally doesn't happen inside of the

4276.8 --> 4281.76
level now there's this just this black

4279.6 --> 4284.159000000001
spot there

4281.76 --> 4286.159000000001
well it's like

4284.159 --> 4288.239
the outside

4286.159 --> 4290.799999999999
of the level which you can never

4288.239 --> 4294.48
be you can ever get there

4290.8 --> 4299.56
it's just nothing's going to be in there

4294.48 --> 4299.5599999999995
just not available space non-space

4303.76 --> 4308.96
right or you could use the same example

4305.6 --> 4309.92
with like a game like pac-man

4308.96 --> 4312.96
right

4309.92 --> 4315.12
there's like this transition zone

4312.96 --> 4317.52
where you can go from one end of the

4315.12 --> 4318.96
screen to the other

4317.52 --> 4320.96
and i think there's like pac-man

4318.96 --> 4322.56
versions where like the entire screen

4320.96 --> 4324.32
where you're actually centered around

4322.56 --> 4326.84
pac-man and then

4324.32 --> 4329.36
the screen can even

4326.84 --> 4332.2390000000005
move well there's going to be parts

4329.36 --> 4334.88
where there's literally nothing there

4332.239 --> 4337.199
like outside of the level

4334.88 --> 4339.76
that's what non-space is it's just

4337.199 --> 4341.5199999999995
outside of the level

4339.76 --> 4343.6
there's nothing there there's no

4341.52 --> 4346.96
no place

4343.6 --> 4346.96
for something to be there

4354.239 --> 4359.28
yeah non-space it's weird it's science

4356.8 --> 4359.28
fiction

4363.6 --> 4365.84
right

4366.64 --> 4373.92
really the only reason i even conjured

4369.04 --> 4373.92
it up as a potential option is

4374.64 --> 4378.64
the only place we might ever perceive

4376.88 --> 4381.679
anything that could be counter space

4378.64 --> 4383.4400000000005
other than oh the barrier that might or

4381.679 --> 4385.12
might not be there

4383.44 --> 4387.839999999999
the vertical one

4385.12 --> 4389.92
there it might not be any barrier right

4387.84 --> 4391.4400000000005
but it if there wasn't any then there

4389.92 --> 4393.52
would at least

4391.44 --> 4395.599999999999
seems logical to me that there would be

4393.52 --> 4398.400000000001
like a pillar

4395.6 --> 4401.76
of the earth or something

4398.4 --> 4404.239
right a a connection that would well

4401.76 --> 4404.2390000000005
prevent

4407.52 --> 4412.400000000001
a ceiling from dropping down if there

4409.76 --> 4414.159000000001
was anything physical right because if

4412.4 --> 4416.0
there isn't anything physical it's just

4414.159 --> 4418.799999999999
non-space up there

4416.0 --> 4420.64
well then you don't need

4418.8 --> 4424.159000000001
any pillar because there's physically

4420.64 --> 4427.04
nothing to that is resting on anything

4424.159 --> 4430.159
so yeah

4427.04 --> 4432.88
it is kind of like paradoxical the way i

4430.159 --> 4432.879999999999
came up with that

4434.96 --> 4438.159
but yeah

4436.08 --> 4440.8
the most

4438.159 --> 4444.32
remotely logical way you would ever find

4440.8 --> 4446.719
non-space is if you would bump into the

4444.32 --> 4448.88
pillar of the earth

4446.719 --> 4451.44
which would be like a

4448.88 --> 4453.52
yeah like a pillar of non-space and you

4451.44 --> 4454.719
could probably see through it it might

4453.52 --> 4458.400000000001
even look

4454.719 --> 4458.4
like you're looking through thin air

4460.32 --> 4465.199
right like you're literally like looking

4462.56 --> 4468.64
through nothing it's just a vacuum it

4465.199 --> 4471.36
would look like perfect vacuum

4468.64 --> 4473.1990000000005
without a barrier it would look like

4471.36 --> 4475.199
that because it isn't there's literally

4473.199 --> 4477.759999999999
nothing there is no volume for anything

4475.199 --> 4477.759999999999
to be in

4480.0 --> 4483.6
can you imagine that how weird that

4481.44 --> 4485.44
would be if you you have like a pillar

4483.6 --> 4487.92
who knows how wide it is maybe it's like

4485.44 --> 4490.159
a hundred meters across

4487.92 --> 4493.679
it's just this pillar from

4490.159 --> 4495.679
that goes straight from heaven to

4493.679 --> 4498.4
through the earth even might even go

4495.679 --> 4499.76
like red right

4498.4 --> 4502.639999999999
it might look

4499.76 --> 4504.56
like you're looking in a hole even right

4502.64 --> 4508.4800000000005
maybe there's just dirt all over the

4504.56 --> 4510.56
place right heaped up right against it

4508.48 --> 4512.4
and you would have this pillar of

4510.56 --> 4514.080000000001
nothing and it would just you would

4512.4 --> 4516.96
approach and you would might think like

4514.08 --> 4521.6
hey there's a really big hole there

4516.96 --> 4524.6
what's that boonk oh wait this is solid

4521.6 --> 4524.6
right

4529.36 --> 4533.12
non-space yeah

4530.82 --> 4537.4
[Music]

4533.12 --> 4537.4
i come up with these types of things

4538.719 --> 4541.719
so

4556.239 --> 4563.32
no i could move fires

4559.28 --> 4563.32
no absolutely not

4572.239 --> 4574.718999999999
you see

4575.199 --> 4580.0
space between

4578.4 --> 4581.839999999999
is

4580.0 --> 4584.48
space

4581.84 --> 4584.4800000000005
between

4584.76 --> 4587.52
non-space

4586.719 --> 4590.4
is

4587.52 --> 4591.120000000001
not space

4590.4 --> 4594.879999999999
so

4591.12 --> 4597.76
it's kind of bizarre to ask me if none

4594.88 --> 4600.159000000001
space not space would be

4597.76 --> 4601.92
the space between

4600.159 --> 4605.719
no

4601.92 --> 4605.719
exactly no

4608.48 --> 4615.04
it would be nothing oblivion

4611.12 --> 4615.04
yeah impenetrable oblivion

4616.719 --> 4621.44
anything that could potentially go

4619.199 --> 4624.08
through it

4621.44 --> 4624.08
is light

4624.4 --> 4627.719
that's it

4655.44 --> 4660.719
no akuma virus

4657.44 --> 4662.5599999999995
you can name another 10 000 examples

4660.719 --> 4664.96
they're all not going to be like

4662.56 --> 4666.719
non-space exactly the opposite because

4664.96 --> 4671.199
every time there's oh there's a space in

4666.719 --> 4674.56
between here yeah so not non-space then

4671.199 --> 4677.36
because non-space is not space

4674.56 --> 4679.52
the space in between something

4677.36 --> 4684.5599999999995
is space

4679.52 --> 4684.56
non-space is not space

4691.44 --> 4695.239
i mean come on

4710.08 --> 4715.12
yeah non-space is not a new exciting

4712.64 --> 4718.56
realm to explore okay

4715.12 --> 4720.5599999999995
it's not space it's not bad it's exactly

4718.56 --> 4723.04
not that it's the opposite it's like

4720.56 --> 4725.280000000001
something that is

4723.04 --> 4727.679
immovable

4725.28 --> 4730.239
impenetrable except maybe

4727.679 --> 4730.2390000000005
with light

4730.64 --> 4735.84
and there's nothing you could ever do

4732.239 --> 4735.839999999999
with it except bump into it

4746.16 --> 4750.08
[Music]

4748.239 --> 4751.678999999999
what really you think that non-space is

4750.08 --> 4752.64
feasible

4751.679 --> 4754.32
thank you

4752.64 --> 4757.84
well

4754.32 --> 4760.4
non-space as like a pillar is really

4757.84 --> 4764.64
the likelihood of that ever existing in

4760.4 --> 4767.839999999999
any form anywhere is extremely low

4764.64 --> 4771.4400000000005
but when it comes to the space outside

4767.84 --> 4772.2390000000005
of the available volume of the realm

4771.44 --> 4775.28
that

4772.239 --> 4778.0
it would all be non-space is to me

4775.28 --> 4778.0
pretty much 100

4778.159 --> 4784.5599999999995
because there is no infinite volume for

4780.96 --> 4788.92
matter it does not exist

4784.56 --> 4788.92
that's like logically impossible

4790.0 --> 4796.159
very dollar constant counter space

4793.36 --> 4798.239
no because counter space is still space

4796.159 --> 4800.96
in between space

4798.239 --> 4800.959999999999
the whole point

4801.92 --> 4807.12
about non-space is that it's not space

4804.64 --> 4808.4800000000005
it's not counter space it's not real

4807.12 --> 4809.199
space it's

4808.48 --> 4811.919999999999
it's

4809.199 --> 4813.199
non-space everything that has the word

4811.92 --> 4814.88
space in it

4813.199 --> 4817.759999999999
is not

4814.88 --> 4821.6
non-space because non-space is the

4817.76 --> 4823.4400000000005
opposite of everything that is space

4821.6 --> 4825.76
for [ __ ] sake

4823.44 --> 4829.599999999999
come on

4825.76 --> 4829.6
this is not that complicated

4831.6 --> 4835.52
hey rob h

4832.96 --> 4835.52
good to see you

4841.04 --> 4845.28
what would happen if a jet fighter flies

4843.12 --> 4847.84
into knots yeah it would absolutely

4845.28 --> 4847.84
splatter

4853.44 --> 4858.159
as i said before if there was anything

4856.239 --> 4861.04
non-space anywhere

4858.159 --> 4864.32
you could theoretically put the entire

4861.04 --> 4867.12
weight of all matter in the realm

4864.32 --> 4869.92
focused on one single point

4867.12 --> 4871.199
which might be like a millimeter across

4869.92 --> 4874.159
all

4871.199 --> 4876.879999999999
on the non-space and it would not budge

4874.159 --> 4879.44
nothing will make it budge because it

4876.88 --> 4882.4400000000005
cannot budge because it's literally not

4879.44 --> 4882.44
space

4914.56 --> 4920.0
no there is no stuff in non-space that's

4917.36 --> 4920.0
the point

4920.32 --> 4926.08
if there's stuff in non-space

4922.719 --> 4928.719
then it's not non-space

4926.08 --> 4928.719
come on

4928.88 --> 4931.52
look

4929.76 --> 4934.96
non-space

4931.52 --> 4937.6
is actually the real vacuum

4934.96 --> 4939.44
that on which the idea of the infinite

4937.6 --> 4941.6
space was based and then they reversed

4939.44 --> 4941.599999999999
it

4941.84 --> 4945.28
that's what i think

4943.28 --> 4946.88
because if it really exists and i think

4945.28 --> 4949.36
it does

4946.88 --> 4951.4400000000005
people will or

4949.36 --> 4954.799999999999
beings

4951.44 --> 4954.799999999999
will have taken notice

4955.12 --> 4960.239
and outer space seems like the exact

4957.679 --> 4960.2390000000005
opposite

4960.8 --> 4965.28
of non-space

4963.44 --> 4968.4
it's the infinite

4965.28 --> 4970.88
vacuum the infinite volume for matter to

4968.4 --> 4972.4
be in

4970.88 --> 4974.639
that's literally

4972.4 --> 4977.44
word by word the exact opposite of what

4974.639 --> 4977.4400000000005
non-space is

4985.44 --> 4990.08
non-space in every atom no that's

4987.84 --> 4992.56
freaking impossible matter can move

4990.08 --> 4995.12
around if there was none space in matter

4992.56 --> 4996.88
then everything would be rigid there

4995.12 --> 4998.84
would be no chemistry there would be

4996.88 --> 5000.719
nothing there would be effectively no

4998.84 --> 5003.84
matter

5000.719 --> 5006.159
non-space is 100 percent immobile it

5003.84 --> 5009.159000000001
cannot be in anything that is moving

5006.159 --> 5009.159
around

5029.36 --> 5032.36
huh

5054.08 --> 5058.8
well aries 106 look

5056.56 --> 5062.0
i only argue

5058.8 --> 5063.92
that potentially light may go through

5062.0 --> 5067.28
non-space

5063.92 --> 5068.4800000000005
it also might not go through non-space

5067.28 --> 5070.48
i don't know

5068.48 --> 5071.919999999999
i mean it could either just be perfect

5070.48 --> 5074.959999999999
pitch black

5071.92 --> 5074.96
like the ultimate

5075.679 --> 5080.159
like a solid yeah like non-space it

5078.32 --> 5082.639
would either be perfectly pitch black

5080.159 --> 5084.719
without light penetrating or it would be

5082.639 --> 5087.28
perfectly transparent

5084.719 --> 5088.96
i don't know it's going to be either one

5087.28 --> 5091.36
and nothing in between

5088.96 --> 5094.08
either perfectly transparent or

5091.36 --> 5096.719
perfectly in transparent i don't know it

5094.08 --> 5099.719
depends on if light would go through

5096.719 --> 5099.719
non-volume

5101.04 --> 5105.76
i don't know

5102.32 --> 5109.36
if light does seem to work fantastically

5105.76 --> 5112.159000000001
going through evacuated volume

5109.36 --> 5114.48
right without anything to obstruct it to

5112.159 --> 5118.159
reflect off or absorb it

5114.48 --> 5119.678999999999
and by that standard i thought okay

5118.159 --> 5121.36
well maybe that

5119.679 --> 5123.28
it works the same with non-space because

5121.36 --> 5125.12
there's literally nothing there to

5123.28 --> 5128.32
obstruct it so it will just go through

5125.12 --> 5128.32
it through it perfectly

5128.4 --> 5133.5199999999995
but it might also be that light just

5130.159 --> 5133.5199999999995
cannot i don't know

5136.56 --> 5142.88
it's much more fascinating to think

5138.56 --> 5144.4800000000005
about a pillar of cow of non-space

5142.88 --> 5146.159000000001
where light would shine through it i

5144.48 --> 5148.0
mean that's like a fascinating

5146.159 --> 5149.679
conception that you could play around in

5148.0 --> 5150.48
your mind with but that doesn't mean

5149.679 --> 5152.719
that

5150.48 --> 5155.839999999999
if there is non-space anywhere that we

5152.719 --> 5155.84
could isolate

5164.53 --> 5169.84
[Applause]

5167.28 --> 5169.84
yeah i'm back

5170.08 --> 5173.08
right

5192.88 --> 5197.84
ah right akuma virus is getting it yeah

5195.76 --> 5199.280000000001
you're right space literally everything

5197.84 --> 5203.04
is in space

5199.28 --> 5205.28
non-space literally nothing is in there

5203.04 --> 5205.28
yeah

5206.239 --> 5210.5599999999995
right

5208.08 --> 5213.28
i'm glad i'm i'm getting this

5210.56 --> 5217.120000000001
science fiction concept through that

5213.28 --> 5219.44
i don't think there's a likelihood of uh

5217.12 --> 5221.679
being a reality

5219.44 --> 5224.32
although i'm taking it to kind of weird

5221.679 --> 5226.96
proportions by saying oh look at this

5224.32 --> 5229.84
what if a pillar of it right as already

5226.96 --> 5231.199
said that's an extremely extremely

5229.84 --> 5233.92
remote chance that there would be

5231.199 --> 5235.5199999999995
anything like that

5233.92 --> 5238.2390000000005
but

5235.52 --> 5241.040000000001
when it comes to like what is outside of

5238.239 --> 5242.5599999999995
the available volume of our realm

5241.04 --> 5246.239
i think there's a great likelihood that

5242.56 --> 5248.400000000001
there is none space there

5246.239 --> 5252.5599999999995
in which we would always be on the other

5248.4 --> 5254.879999999999
side we there would be no volume

5252.56 --> 5257.52
surrounding non-space

5254.88 --> 5262.0
right or you could look through it right

5257.52 --> 5262.0
that would probably not exist

5264.4 --> 5267.4
anyway

5271.04 --> 5275.04
so it's supernatural then

5276.88 --> 5279.88
no

5281.6 --> 5287.04
it's literally nothing

5284.239 --> 5289.44
it is nothing beyond nothing it's not

5287.04 --> 5294.36
supernatural it's not material it's not

5289.44 --> 5294.36
energy it is literally nothing

5295.92 --> 5300.96
it's like perfect vacuum

5298.4 --> 5304.08
and then the

5300.96 --> 5306.0
volume potential in also taken away from

5304.08 --> 5308.0
that which is by the way not something

5306.0 --> 5311.92
that we can demonstrate this is not

5308.0 --> 5311.92
something that we could do as humans

5312.4 --> 5315.199
you can think about

5314.4 --> 5318.5599999999995
what

5315.199 --> 5323.839999999999
how to compare it a perfect vacuum with

5318.56 --> 5323.84
the option of it to be filled taken out

5327.12 --> 5331.48
and immobile very important

5343.92 --> 5346.92
fine

5351.679 --> 5354.88
okay akuma virus

5361.84 --> 5365.84
i don't watch any of those series so

5385.44 --> 5389.678999999999
right so guys i hope you're all enjoying

5387.52 --> 5389.679
the

5390.84 --> 5396.0
show i'm having fun at least

5393.679 --> 5398.56
some got a t-shirt got some paypal

5396.0 --> 5400.239
donations always makes me

5398.56 --> 5402.88
relieved

5400.239 --> 5402.879999999999
or happy

5403.76 --> 5408.719
there is going to be a flat earth debate

5406.719 --> 5410.08
looking forward to that glad that

5408.719 --> 5413.12
nathan's uh

5410.08 --> 5415.28
pipes water pipes actually turned out to

5413.12 --> 5416.639
be fixed properly because

5415.28 --> 5418.159
that's why he didn't stream live

5416.639 --> 5421.400000000001
yesterday because he was really nervous

5418.159 --> 5421.4
about that

5424.08 --> 5427.199
by the way yesterday show got a lot of

5426.159 --> 5429.759999999999
views

5427.199 --> 5431.919999999999
347.

5429.76 --> 5434.2390000000005
i wonder that if that's because it was

5431.92 --> 5437.76
over three hours

5434.239 --> 5439.678999999999
or because i just went rage win again

5437.76 --> 5442.4800000000005
never too sure but i know there are

5439.679 --> 5443.92
literal outspoken fans of rage win out

5442.48 --> 5445.44
there which is really weird to me

5443.92 --> 5446.56
sometimes

5445.44 --> 5449.839999999999
it's like

5446.56 --> 5449.84
really okay

5458.88 --> 5463.76
what was the show about about the dutch

5461.28 --> 5465.92
energy crisis

5463.76 --> 5468.08
that that's what my show yesterday was

5465.92 --> 5470.639
about

5468.08 --> 5472.159
except it's like me breaking the news of

5470.639 --> 5475.52
oh [ __ ]

5472.159 --> 5477.839999999999
and i was really demoralized on average

5475.52 --> 5477.84
so

5479.76 --> 5486.4800000000005
and i kind of was already like with

5482.28 --> 5486.48
1356 which was untitled

5487.12 --> 5493.92
but i didn't have i didn't get the news

5490.159 --> 5496.159
yet but i already felt like

5493.92 --> 5496.159
just

5497.28 --> 5501.12
something bad was gonna happen and it

5498.88 --> 5501.12
did

5501.679 --> 5506.32
anyway

5503.52 --> 5508.56
i'm really appreciating uh

5506.32 --> 5511.12
the back and forth with you guys talking

5508.56 --> 5513.6
about things like non-space

5511.12 --> 5516.4
it is a very interesting concept

5513.6 --> 5519.360000000001
and it is kind of like the freshest one

5516.4 --> 5521.759999999999
on the list i guess the arwynian list

5519.36 --> 5524.08
police holographic celestials being

5521.76 --> 5524.08
first

5524.159 --> 5528.96
looping being second

5526.88 --> 5531.28
right looping space

5528.96 --> 5533.679
and yeah non-space is is kind of the

5531.28 --> 5535.12
last arrival

5533.679 --> 5537.76
in that line

5535.12 --> 5539.679
when it comes to like realm nature

5537.76 --> 5542.679
elementals

5539.679 --> 5542.679
elements

5549.92 --> 5554.96
try getting 2k added to your mortgage go

5552.159 --> 5554.96
to jesus

5557.36 --> 5561.5199999999995
okay

5559.36 --> 5564.0
you got some financial issues too george

5561.52 --> 5564.0
sanford

5569.28 --> 5573.04
yeah i hope that works out for you

5571.04 --> 5575.04
seriously but anyway

5573.04 --> 5577.28
i'm rounding out the show

5575.04 --> 5578.96
so thanks everyone for coming

5577.28 --> 5581.28
i hope you liked this show i thought it

5578.96 --> 5583.76
was a blast really i'm

5581.28 --> 5586.88
i'm just so happy with the shirt

5583.76 --> 5586.88
i think that's cool that i

5588.48 --> 5593.12
it's like the first sort of merchandise

5590.88 --> 5596.159000000001
attempt that i'm like yeah this is this

5593.12 --> 5597.84
is good this is good enough this is not

5596.159 --> 5599.5199999999995
gonna go wrong

5597.84 --> 5601.28
right

5599.52 --> 5603.1990000000005
because there were ideas before of like

5601.28 --> 5606.8
oh maybe you could have like an

5603.199 --> 5608.32
angel of you with fiery wings and we

5606.8 --> 5609.76
kind of made the pictures and then it

5608.32 --> 5611.599999999999
was like

5609.76 --> 5614.320000000001
this is probably not a great idea

5611.6 --> 5615.4400000000005
because nathan had a t-shirt store for a

5614.32 --> 5617.759999999999
while

5615.44 --> 5618.879999999999
and then that t-shirt was actually on

5617.76 --> 5621.4400000000005
there

5618.88 --> 5624.159000000001
but i felt really like uh this might not

5621.44 --> 5626.719
be the best idea like karmically

5624.159 --> 5628.799999999999
and this one this one i see absolutely

5626.719 --> 5630.88
no problem with so i'm just really happy

5628.8 --> 5632.320000000001
because it's just the pure concentrated

5630.88 --> 5633.92
message

5632.32 --> 5637.599999999999
i like that

5633.92 --> 5638.719
no form of idolatry or anything

5637.6 --> 5641.04
