formed but yeah couple of clouds lots of

127.32 --> 138.28
Blue Sky in between and some nice Sun

133.0 --> 140.319
Also yeah barely any wind it's just very

138.28 --> 144.04
beautiful look at

140.319 --> 144.04
the sun just

146.44 --> 152.319
shining it looks like a nice warm light

149.36 --> 155.56
too but I mean it is very cold outside I

152.319 --> 155.56
got my door closed for a

157.879 --> 163.64
reason I had it open all night but yeah

160.76 --> 167.92
that's under the blanket

163.64 --> 171.39999999999998
so cuz I think it's been freezing right

167.92 --> 173.07999999999998
also yeah the giant puddle down there in

171.4 --> 175.239
the grass field

173.08 --> 179.48000000000002
has almost

175.239 --> 181.04
completely dried up or proceeded into

179.48 --> 185.48
the

181.04 --> 190.76
ground which is I'm very glad of because

185.48 --> 190.76
can't wait till this freaking drops stop

192.519 --> 198.76
dropping CU been leaky in this room now

196.159 --> 200.319
for like a week kind of

198.76 --> 203.319
sucks

200.319 --> 205.28
anyhow hello dupons first in chat good

215.08 --> 224.87900000000002
4 temperatures yeah minus1

220.72 --> 227.959
Celsius so it is actually freezing right

224.879 --> 230.56
now and at night it could be like minus

227.959 --> 233.079
4 minus5

230.56 --> 235.959
so I'm going to check to see if there's

233.079 --> 239.4
going to be any ice on the roofs at

235.959 --> 244.0
night this I'm just glad that all the

239.4 --> 246.04
fre freaking rain is just get out and

244.0 --> 248.159
from the predictions of the coming week

246.04 --> 250.79899999999998
it it does seem like it's really going

248.159 --> 253.12
to no longer rain and I'm very happy

250.799 --> 253.12
about

255.479 --> 263.28000000000003
that cuz I was kind of done with it and

258.759 --> 266.44
I want some sun back like today I mean

263.28 --> 266.44
it makes me feel like

268.6 --> 272.47900000000004
great right

278.52 --> 282.039
anyhow cut some

282.28 --> 285.28
tea

286.919 --> 292.919
Min Illuminati

289.44 --> 298.08
croissant which I'm looking forward to

292.919 --> 298.08
and downstairs I got coffee ready to

298.56 --> 303.039
go

300.4 --> 303.039
ready for the

306.12 --> 313.16
Brewing right but still this night I was

308.8 --> 316.919
managed to kept up I was kept up

313.16 --> 319.88000000000005
late it's just this n not super super

316.919 --> 322.75899999999996
late though but it was kind of funny

319.88 --> 326.919
because like very late at night Alex

322.759 --> 331.44
went into this live debate in

326.919 --> 334.28
studio and oh my God it wasn't lot of

331.44 --> 337.12
romping and it drove people

334.28 --> 339.28
nuts so it was kind of funny in a way it

337.12 --> 342.639
was almost like watching The Flat Earth

339.28 --> 342.63899999999995
debates when a baller comes

342.919 --> 348.44
on everybody responding to that in the

345.56 --> 352.88
chat how they are well it was like

348.44 --> 356.199
that and it it drew a a big crowd cuz

352.88 --> 359.68
they had some like three little

356.199 --> 361.88
dwarf [ __ ] figures that were just

359.68 --> 364.479
super liberal

361.88 --> 366.919
apologetic and it was all about January

364.479 --> 368.15999999999997
6 so it was like actually kind of boring

366.919 --> 372.4
to

368.16 --> 375.28000000000003
me and just recycling the same

372.4 --> 379.0
stuff but I mean it happened and

375.28 --> 381.52
it it was kind of amusing in that sense

379.0 --> 384.52
so I just wanted to see how everybody

381.52 --> 384.52
was responding to

388.16 --> 394.28000000000003
that right but yeah that was

390.319 --> 397.199
entertaining Alex against the three

394.28 --> 399.35999999999996
drawers and he made him them actually

397.199 --> 405.40000000000003
look like dwarfs I mean Alex Jones is

399.36 --> 409.40000000000003
not a big guy but those guys were

405.4 --> 414.28
like way smaller than him and

409.4 --> 417.28
like thin they were like

414.28 --> 417.28
shrunken

418.4 --> 426.31899999999996
guys you can guess as to like the origin

422.36 --> 430.039
but uh whatever that kept me up for a

426.319 --> 432.56
bit uh ball busters of course but ball

430.039 --> 438.28
busters did round out very

432.56 --> 441.28000000000003
early compared to last week uh two weeks

438.28 --> 441.28
ago

442.44 --> 449.039
um watched a movie that was kind of

446.039 --> 451.31899999999996
stupid not really interested to talk

449.039 --> 451.31899999999996
about

451.84 --> 454.28
yeah that's

456.44 --> 462.36
it I'm doing a lot

459.199 --> 465.0
better no more cramps keeping me up at

462.36 --> 467.68
night it seems like that's over so it is

465.0 --> 470.599
it is like a periodic cycle thing it

467.68 --> 472.8
feels like it's a cycle thing but

470.599 --> 474.8
sometimes when it's happening like 3

472.8 --> 476.72
days in a row it just feels like oh my

474.8 --> 478.08
God is it now never going to go away

476.72 --> 480.40000000000003
this

478.08 --> 483.71999999999997
time but it

480.4 --> 483.71999999999997
does thank

488.4 --> 492.84
God and yeah I feel a lot better

495.319 --> 500.96000000000004
now the chicken ketchup dinners have

498.199 --> 503.96000000000004
actually been kind of great I had them

500.96 --> 508.159
now is it

503.96 --> 508.159
four four days in a row I

508.24 --> 512.319
think and it like was

515.2 --> 522.719
great but yeah it's it's done so I'm

519.24 --> 524.92
going to have to get some new

522.719 --> 529.32
dinner after the show and it will

524.92 --> 529.3199999999999
probably be dark but oh

533.279 --> 541.399
well right so yeah doons how are you

536.92 --> 541.399

good late afternoon for Terra

628.04 --> 631.04
306

638.24 --> 641.0790000000001
a come

645.519 --> 648.519
on

658.04 --> 661.04
what

661.399 --> 663.6
uh

669.04 --> 676.519
oh I'm just reading the news here seems

673.6 --> 681.32
like there's an issue with

676.519 --> 681.32
Baghdad or with

682.079 --> 687.8
Iraq they're kicking out US troops

687.959 --> 690.959
apparently

691.6 --> 695.839
because of some air strike that happened

702.2 --> 707.76
recently weird half hour time zones

704.8 --> 707.76
hello heart

708.399 --> 714.72
Earth yeah time zones are

711.56 --> 717.959
weird in

714.72 --> 720.9200000000001
general and

717.959 --> 726.04
confusing

720.92 --> 729.36
should have Cat Williams on okay

726.04 --> 729.36
sure who's

731.279 --> 736.24
that a few million views

736.76 --> 741.959
what

739.68 --> 745.399
what I have no idea what you're talking

741.959 --> 745.399
about Woodwork and guny bear but

747.16 --> 752.8389999999999
sure oh by the way I have not received

749.72 --> 755.32
any emails from people that want to get

752.839 --> 757.7600000000001
on my early birth show the invite still

755.32 --> 757.7600000000001
open

760.839 --> 766.12
though maybe the time slot's just really

763.839 --> 768.72
inconvenient for like most people in the

766.12 --> 768.72
world or

777.839 --> 785.0400000000001
something it's really enjoyable to just

780.959 --> 787.199
have some sun even reflecting indirectly

785.04 --> 789.76
into my

787.199 --> 792.04
eyes I've really missed the sun in the

789.76 --> 792.04
last

792.36 --> 795.36
week

807.76 --> 810.76
what

816.88 --> 820.199
you're going to make me Google

820.399 --> 825.839
him I should probably I really should

823.92 --> 827.4799999999999
after yesterday's test I should probably

825.839 --> 831.9200000000001
like switch to

827.48 --> 831.9200000000001
Bing what the

832.04 --> 836.88
oh that

833.88 --> 836.88
guy

837.759 --> 841.72
uh

839.48 --> 841.72
see

843.68 --> 848.7589999999999
him that would be really weird if he

846.079 --> 848.7589999999999
came on my

863.68 --> 867.399
show I kind of doubt

867.68 --> 870.68
it

876.12 --> 882.639
and by the way teret to answer your

879.16 --> 885.6
question is he like Dave Chappelle yes

882.639 --> 885.6
he too is

897.68 --> 900.68
black

901.639 --> 905.0
oh comedian right

919.12 --> 924.519
right oh was a joke oh

927.6 --> 930.6
fine

944.0 --> 948.48
seems he exposes others he's gone after

947.48 --> 951.8000000000001
Joe

948.48 --> 955.399
Rogan that's what the Google headline

951.8 --> 955.399
show shoved in my

955.839 --> 961.9200000000001
face so whatever unless somebody's like

960.0 --> 963.88
already into that and can explain a

961.92 --> 969.24
little bit about it I don't really care

963.88 --> 969.24
to try to dig into this nonsense it's

969.68 --> 973.2399999999999
obviously Fe the

973.36 --> 977.12
nonsense in media

984.0 --> 989.48
World comedian who has become a truther

986.759 --> 993.319
o wow not very original

989.48 --> 996.759
that's so it's another Owen

993.319 --> 1000.12
Benjamin it's another black

996.759 --> 1003.639
guy copying Owen

1000.12 --> 1006.839
Benjamin nah I don't know I'll leave it

1003.639 --> 1010.9590000000001
to Owen Benjamin to be the judge of that

1006.839 --> 1010.9590000000001
it's it's his Turf it's his the

1012.12 --> 1017.44
hill he's the one that can joke about

1014.959 --> 1019.959
that I'm not going to try to joke about

1017.44 --> 1021.5600000000001
these things before he he jokes about

1019.959 --> 1027.36
it

1021.56 --> 1027.36
h more like black George Carlin

1047.4 --> 1050.4
okay

1060.799 --> 1065.08
everybody expose everybody that nobody

1062.96 --> 1068.24
will punished that's an

1065.08 --> 1070.9189999999999
interesting tactical thought there

1068.24 --> 1073.52
teret

1070.919 --> 1075.919
maybe I mean it is something that if

1073.52 --> 1080.36
like if there's just too much crime

1075.919 --> 1082.64
everywhere then people just

1080.36 --> 1086.52
if there's too much punishing to be done

1082.64 --> 1086.5200000000002
then people lose their stomachs for

1095.4 --> 1103.2
it so yeah people are manipulable they

1099.4 --> 1105.76
might be look what I think that the

1103.2 --> 1107.8400000000001
elite are actually going to try is

1105.76 --> 1111.4
they're going to try to like literally

1107.84 --> 1115.0
copy conspiracy

1111.4 --> 1117.2800000000002
act and then just like almost indirectly

1115.0 --> 1119.36
even accuse themselves and it's like so

1117.28 --> 1123.24
that everybody gets comfortable with it

1119.36 --> 1125.4399999999998
and then just move on like nothing

1123.24 --> 1127.679
happened they're like yeah yeah yeah we

1125.44 --> 1130.559
did it this and that and this is our

1127.679 --> 1133.0800000000002
plan and

1130.559 --> 1136.28
yeah and that's just the way it is I

1133.08 --> 1136.28
think that they want to try

1137.32 --> 1140.32
that

1146.679 --> 1153.72
consent becomes law no that that's

1150.12 --> 1153.7199999999998
literally technically

1158.96 --> 1163.72
impossible if it's forced consent then

1161.72 --> 1166.799
it's not

1163.72 --> 1170.24
consent that's that's double

1166.799 --> 1170.24
speak self

1183.0 --> 1188.4
contradicting oh we'll get away with

1185.6 --> 1191.32
yeah yeah ter I'm actually much more for

1188.4 --> 1195.0
the no no no no all of them should be

1191.32 --> 1200.24
punished yeah and the so-called nice

1195.0 --> 1200.24
guys should P be punished even harder

1207.4 --> 1209.96
that's what I

1211.88 --> 1217.0800000000002
think oh we don't want to punish the

1214.6 --> 1219.8799999999999
nice guys that were involved oh oh

1217.08 --> 1222.3999999999999
really oh then punish them even more

1219.88 --> 1224.7600000000002
brutally and then let's move up to the

1222.4 --> 1227.159
ones you don't have sympathy

1224.76 --> 1230.1589999999999
for how about

1227.159 --> 1230.159
that

1238.64 --> 1245.64
oh yeah good that's a good thing

1241.039 --> 1247.2
teret CU to be fair I don't know about

1245.64 --> 1249.3200000000002
everybody else but me personally I

1247.2 --> 1251.72
wasn't really like looking forward to

1249.32 --> 1254.039
hearing about updates about that I'm

1251.72 --> 1257.28
just glad that it's that it's working

1254.039 --> 1259.559
for you but I don't really need to have

1257.28 --> 1261.52
an update about about that

1259.559 --> 1265.6
thanks

1261.52 --> 1265.6
but yeah good for you

1288.6 --> 1291.799
yeah hey

1317.039 --> 1321.76
Tommy but I mean it is kind of you know

1319.919 --> 1323.88
what it is kind of interesting to talk

1321.76 --> 1326.84
about it as a concept

1323.88 --> 1329.5590000000002
because the people that have literally

1326.84 --> 1330.8799999999999
orchestrated pretty much everything

1329.559 --> 1333.84
there're they're

1330.88 --> 1336.8400000000001
like more exposed than they've ever

1333.84 --> 1340.24
imagine they could

1336.84 --> 1342.6
be in the original simulations that they

1340.24 --> 1346.0
went through because they tend to plan

1342.6 --> 1348.039
out things insanely far ahead of time

1346.0 --> 1349.919
the original simulations they were

1348.039 --> 1351.96
exposed to like by the time they would

1349.919 --> 1356.3200000000002
have been exposed to this level they

1351.96 --> 1356.32
already already imagined themselves in

1356.799 --> 1366.24
jail or taken care of in some other way

1361.52 --> 1369.44
originally so this is like it's

1366.24 --> 1373.08
like the s that the [ __ ] that they've

1369.44 --> 1375.679
created in a way makes everything

1373.08 --> 1379.6
unpredictable the chaos they've

1375.679 --> 1383.0
Unleashed upon the world is so bad that

1379.6 --> 1383.0
it even defies their own

1394.36 --> 1400.1589999999999
predictions right and the original

1397.72 --> 1401.64
prediction is just like there's and I

1400.159 --> 1404.0800000000002
the funny thing is I even called that

1401.64 --> 1405.159
like 20 years ago in my Dark World

1404.08 --> 1406.8799999999999
experience and everything it's like

1405.159 --> 1408.679
there's a

1406.88 --> 1412.64
split

1408.679 --> 1415.88
the original models before I I put my

1412.64 --> 1420.44
mind to it they were all just thinking

1415.88 --> 1421.7990000000002
like yeah just everybody's one group and

1420.44 --> 1425.679
then there's the

1421.799 --> 1428.6
outsiders but no it's like a

1425.679 --> 1431.3200000000002
distinct dance between sleepers and

1428.6 --> 1434.6399999999999
awakened and people that persist in

1431.32 --> 1436.8799999999999
their sleep with people that persist to

1434.64 --> 1440.5590000000002
try to awaken them and

1436.88 --> 1444.159
like the original models did not foresee

1440.559 --> 1447.76
that happening I foresaw that happening

1444.159 --> 1450.7600000000002
and it has been happening and it is

1447.76 --> 1450.76
happening

1455.159 --> 1461.159
more right not just flat Earth it's

1458.12 --> 1462.84
everywhere there people basically that

1461.159 --> 1464.8400000000001
are just like putting their heels in

1462.84 --> 1469.08
their sand trying to be the The Rock in

1464.84 --> 1471.36
the brand on the beach like like oh

1469.08 --> 1473.6
doesn't matter what my position is if

1471.36 --> 1475.399
it's irrational like I'm holding on to

1473.6 --> 1478.52
it at all

1475.399 --> 1481.799
cost and people that are

1478.52 --> 1481.799
like just

1483.32 --> 1488.96
getting all the backlash all the stress

1486.64 --> 1491.7990000000002
and all the [ __ ] because those people

1488.96 --> 1495.08
are doing that the awakened and then

1491.799 --> 1497.2
just trying to somehow get through them

1495.08 --> 1500.72
it's on every front it's not just like

1497.2 --> 1503.72
flatter Earth and Globe Earth it's

1500.72 --> 1503.72
stupid things

1505.12 --> 1509.799
too I mean this guy that I heard on Alex

1508.0 --> 1512.64
Jones

1509.799 --> 1513.6399999999999
yesterday he was like oh January 6 was

1512.64 --> 1516.3200000000002
an

1513.64 --> 1518.48
Insurrection and then literally having

1516.32 --> 1521.9189999999999
like laid down

1518.48 --> 1523.84
quoted proof that's all like legally

1521.919 --> 1527.0
officially stamped as in like yeah

1523.84 --> 1528.32
that's real like gets arguments handed

1527.0 --> 1530.559
to him

1528.32 --> 1534.08
and then he starts over again like he

1530.559 --> 1536.6399999999999
literally didn't hear it it's it's just

1534.08 --> 1540.6399999999999
like anti flat earthers that just but

1536.64 --> 1543.039
it's something stupid like January 6

1540.64 --> 1547.0800000000002
Insurrection and they're just they're

1543.039 --> 1549.1589999999999
like years hold their arm to it it's so

1547.08 --> 1552.6789999999999
absurd

1549.159 --> 1552.679
man but that's

1552.88 --> 1559.0800000000002
happening ball tarded isn't limited to

1556.279 --> 1561.919
ball belief it seems to be like

1559.08 --> 1563.6399999999999
cascading out there and people are

1561.919 --> 1566.24
putting their heels in their

1563.64 --> 1569.72
Sands putting their heels in the

1566.24 --> 1572.72
sand really strongly about the most

1569.72 --> 1572.72
ridiculous

1575.799 --> 1582.96
things like gen like genuinely ludicrous

1580.039 --> 1586.0
things and then really holding on to it

1582.96 --> 1589.64
for no [ __ ] logical reason other

1586.0 --> 1591.919
than they feel like they need to protect

1589.64 --> 1594.48
and hold on to something like protect

1591.919 --> 1597.3200000000002
their spiritual Turf even though it's

1594.48 --> 1600.1200000000001
literally a [ __ ] hole like they don't

1597.32 --> 1600.12
know what the hell they're

1606.52 --> 1610.48
doing and that's out there so yeah

1609.399 --> 1612.08
that's part of the reason

1610.48 --> 1613.72
psychologically I thought it was

1612.08 --> 1616.12
interesting and that's why it kept me up

1613.72 --> 1616.1200000000001
a bit

1616.6 --> 1619.6
yesterday

1622.039 --> 1625.399
and you know what I'll try to

1627.32 --> 1633.08
find the actual video where I watch

1637.2 --> 1640.3600000000001
that where

1646.52 --> 1649.52
is

1650.48 --> 1652.679
is

1658.32 --> 1662.039
it this should be

1663.32 --> 1666.32
it

1676.519 --> 1679.519
yeah

1687.0 --> 1692.76
all right so this happened yesterday and

1689.399 --> 1695.84
was over X and everything

1692.76 --> 1698.1589999999999
and I mean information wise it's

1695.84 --> 1700.84
completely useless but psychologically

1698.159 --> 1700.8400000000001
it was kind of

1701.799 --> 1709.44
interesting it just really reminded me

1704.48 --> 1709.44
about like Flat Earth debate stuff

1736.399 --> 1742.12
h

1738.96 --> 1744.3990000000001
H right or or you're good just nobody in

1742.12 --> 1745.399
the chat is like completely interested

1744.399 --> 1748.559
at

1745.399 --> 1750.84
all in such things since nobody's

1748.559 --> 1752.6
actually like addressing anything I'm

1750.84 --> 1755.6
talking

1752.6 --> 1757.9189999999999
about and then fine then we don't talk

1755.6 --> 1760.279
about it if it's like the most boring

1757.919 --> 1763.0
[ __ ] thing you can

1760.279 --> 1766.32
imagine

1763.0 --> 1769.32
fine then

1766.32 --> 1769.32
not

1783.0 --> 1786.679
right meanwhile the Earth is measured

1787.88 --> 1795.0390000000002
flat it's not a belief in that it's flat

1791.799 --> 1795.039
it's measured

1795.279 --> 1799.24
flat we have celestial navigation

1798.039 --> 1803.64
because it's

1799.24 --> 1803.64
flat we have Maps because it's

1806.559 --> 1812.2
flat cinnamon rolls okay fair enough

1809.76 --> 1816.399
would work bear I don't

1812.2 --> 1816.3990000000001
care you're not the only one in the

1817.36 --> 1823.4399999999998
chat anyway I'm going to take a bite out

1819.88 --> 1823.44
of this Illuminati kasan

1826.24 --> 1829.24
cheers

1856.24 --> 1863.24
h the thing about doing a 4our plus live

1861.08 --> 1866.76
stream on your

1863.24 --> 1869.88
own is that usually the next day you're

1866.76 --> 1869.8799999999999
kind of

1886.159 --> 1889.159
depleted

1916.159 --> 1919.159
that's

1926.159 --> 1929.24
I feel like getting a

1932.84 --> 1937.6
coffee I need something to Kickstart me

1935.279 --> 1937.6
a bit

1941.039 --> 1944.559
more be right

1946.08 --> 1949.08
back

1976.039 --> 1979.039
for

2005.96 --> 2008.96
for

2023.519 --> 2031.919
this is a cant tea party now

2027.48 --> 2031.919
okay I'm just having lunch and

2032.399 --> 2038.6
everything getting my coffee until

2035.0 --> 2042.08
something happens until something

2038.6 --> 2044.6789999999999
worth discussing comes

2042.08 --> 2047.36
up what's the lowest temperature there

2044.679 --> 2049.7200000000003
these well it's currently minus one or

2047.36 --> 2049.72
minus

2052.76 --> 2060.079
two so it basically just started to

2056.04 --> 2060.079
become cold weather like

2061.679 --> 2066.2400000000002
this as in

2064.0 --> 2068.119
today and it's probably going to be like

2066.24 --> 2070.399
that the coming week and it's fine I

2068.119 --> 2073.28
like this weather a lot more than what I

2070.399 --> 2073.2799999999997
had the last two

2080.879 --> 2086.2799999999997
weeks what's my opinion on the southern

2084.24 --> 2090.72
axis you

2086.28 --> 2093.2000000000003
mean the celestial virtual axis duper is

2090.72 --> 2093.2
that what you

2095.879 --> 2098.879
mean

2108.839 --> 2113.839
is this I don't know teret I'm not the

2114.28 --> 2120.119
meteorologist I don't have all the

2116.72 --> 2123.2
temperature records at the ready okay

2120.119 --> 2126.2000000000003
why the hell are you asking me that is

2123.2 --> 2127.359
that normal like oh no I'm expecting an

2126.2 --> 2131.48
imminent

2127.359 --> 2135.16
weather infraction no it's always normal

2131.48 --> 2138.28
the weather is always normal it's never

2135.16 --> 2141.92
not normal the weather is always normal

2138.28 --> 2146.52
like even with alleged chem trills

2141.92 --> 2146.52
persistent trills it's always

2149.359 --> 2154.839
normal yeah there's nothing abnormal

2155.8 --> 2158.8
happening

2160.319 --> 2170.359
so yeah I'm glad that it's finally just

2166.319 --> 2172.8
freezing last year it froze too during

2170.359 --> 2175.44
January February it always

2172.8 --> 2179.119
does as far as I can tell there's some

2175.44 --> 2183.76
of it it's never like unfrozen entirely

2179.119 --> 2183.76
snow is a rare thing but it always does

2185.72 --> 2193.359
freeze no I didn't say Netherlands

2188.56 --> 2193.359
doesn't go below zero I've never said

2196.52 --> 2200.24
that what are you talking

2209.96 --> 2215.48
about I mean if it doesn't go below zero

2212.96 --> 2218.92
how can we have a thing called the elf

2215.48 --> 2221.079
ST which is literally ice skating on the

2218.92 --> 2223.0
rivers of the Netherlands how could we

2221.079 --> 2227.599
have that as a tradition if the

2223.0 --> 2227.599
temperature doesn't go below zero teret

2245.599 --> 2248.599
seriously

2251.2 --> 2256.8799999999997
I mean I think you're projecting a bit I

2253.119 --> 2261.599
mean India might be like that

2256.88 --> 2261.599
sure the netland definitely

2263.359 --> 2269.16
isn't we definitely do have temperatures

2266.8 --> 2272.92
below zero at

2269.16 --> 2275.96
winter it's not dramatically below

2272.92 --> 2280.88
zero like the Scandinavian countries for

2275.96 --> 2285.839
example but I mean it does get Freez in

2280.88 --> 2289.92
here maybe said it about early Winters

2285.839 --> 2289.92
no no not

2291.2 --> 2296.0789999999997
really I might have said it like yeah

2293.56 --> 2298.48
right now it's not freezing or oh we

2296.079 --> 2300.6400000000003
might have a bit of a a non-freezing

2298.48 --> 2302.56
time right it doesn't always

2300.64 --> 2303.64
automatically freeze when the winter

2302.56 --> 2307.2799999999997
time

2303.64 --> 2310.0789999999997
arrives but it definitely does freeze

2307.28 --> 2310.079
in the winter

2318.359 --> 2325.24
here minus 10 is the lowest I've seen in

2322.56 --> 2326.88
the Netherlands minus 10 is like yeah

2325.24 --> 2330.1189999999997
that that sounds about right it never

2326.88 --> 2330.119
freezes that hard

2330.56 --> 2335.52
here that's very

2333.0 --> 2337.04
rare it has happened

2335.52 --> 2339.96
though

2337.04 --> 2342.16
it's usually when the elf state to

2339.96 --> 2346.68
starts because I mean yeah that's going

2342.16 --> 2346.68
to definitely freeze up the rivers minus

2352.72 --> 2356.9599999999996
10 that's why the Netherlands does so

2355.0 --> 2359.52
well in the Winter Olympics yeah but

2356.96 --> 2361.48
it's because ice skating is just kind of

2359.52 --> 2364.56
a Dutch tradition

2361.48 --> 2368.359
thing although it it

2364.56 --> 2371.839
rarely still happens there in nature

2368.359 --> 2375.96
because it's just kind of a relatively

2371.839 --> 2378.48
warm period to say a few decades

2375.96 --> 2380.8
ago that's just the way it is I don't

2378.48 --> 2383.0
care it's going to change back it's

2380.8 --> 2384.96
going to get more Frosty period at some

2383.0 --> 2387.599
point too you know it just goes back and

2384.96 --> 2389.76
forth everything goes back and forth a

2387.599 --> 2392.56
little bit more warm on average a little

2389.76 --> 2392.5600000000004
bit more cool on

2395.4 --> 2398.4
average

2400.119 --> 2407.1600000000003
but I mean because of this cultural

2404.0 --> 2408.72
tradition of ice skating even though

2407.16 --> 2412.839
there is

2408.72 --> 2415.64
no freezing Rivers every winter they we

2412.839 --> 2418.64
do have like these ice

2415.64 --> 2421.1189999999997
skating halls and all that all these

2418.64 --> 2425.359
places where you can like ice skate all

2421.119 --> 2428.359
year long and all that thing so we have

2425.359 --> 2428.359
those

2430.64 --> 2437.0789999999997
stadiums places you can ice skate all

2433.76 --> 2439.7200000000003
year long and a lot of Dutch people are

2437.079 --> 2443.96
like yeah Olympic ice skaters and all

2439.72 --> 2443.9599999999996
that a lot there are it's

2444.28 --> 2449.4
popular there's plenty and they're good

2447.24 --> 2449.3999999999996
at

2455.319 --> 2458.319
it

2458.359 --> 2462.7999999999997
rolled up ice skates instead of boats

2460.92 --> 2468.079
well woodworking gunny bear I wouldn't

2462.8 --> 2473.119
be surprised if the Vikings actually did

2468.079 --> 2473.119
have some very limited form of ice

2476.8 --> 2482.96
skates I mean it wouldn't have been like

2479.24 --> 2485.24
they would all use that but some of them

2482.96 --> 2488.2400000000002
probably

2485.24 --> 2488.24
did

2497.76 --> 2505.599
like yeah I mean it wouldn't be yeah it

2503.44 --> 2507.88
would probably be kind of gimmicky back

2505.599 --> 2511.56
then I mean it's very hard to like get a

2507.88 --> 2511.56
blade to be like perfectly

2513.48 --> 2519.52
straight so maybe maybe some of the

2517.079 --> 2521.7200000000003
Vikings actually fantasize like they

2519.52 --> 2523.4
could have swords under their feet and

2521.72 --> 2527.7599999999998
just

2523.4 --> 2530.04
slide on the ice or maybe they did have

2527.76 --> 2532.28
some form of limited skating but they

2530.04 --> 2534.48
would have never like used it in combat

2532.28 --> 2534.48
or

2538.52 --> 2543.88
anything as an idea that seems really

2541.04 --> 2543.88
interesting by the

2545.16 --> 2548.16
way

2548.44 --> 2556.64
like actual melee combat on ice skates

2553.92 --> 2556.64
on an ice

2560.359 --> 2566.92
skape it's like a a a razor sharp hockey

2564.359 --> 2566.92
stick or

2567.359 --> 2574.72
something I don't know it is it would be

2570.04 --> 2574.72
very bloody though but it just as an

2575.16 --> 2578.16
idea

2580.0 --> 2585.16
vik escapades okay yeah

2589.4 --> 2594.52
sure but I mean just say yeah I mean

2592.4 --> 2598.04
it's getting really fictional now it's

2594.52 --> 2598.04
not really Vikings anymore

2598.48 --> 2605.52
but I mean if you just imagine like all

2602.96 --> 2608.68
the countries are like kind of shitty or

2605.52 --> 2609.88
whatever there's there's no problem with

2608.68 --> 2612.52
polar

2609.88 --> 2615.079
bears cuz that's going to screw it up

2612.52 --> 2619.16
and then like yeah defending an ice

2615.079 --> 2622.119
scape if that's like contains like the

2619.16 --> 2625.5589999999997
best fish and krill and everything in

2622.119 --> 2631.0
the world that might be worth fighting

2625.559 --> 2631.0
and protecting right people among

2635.079 --> 2641.319
people help in my flat Earth yeah sure I

2638.599 --> 2641.319
will help you

2646.359 --> 2651.0
duper I'm going to get my coffee be

2648.76 --> 2651.0
right

2665.0 --> 2668.0
back

2694.96 --> 2697.96
for

2708.599 --> 2712.559
Hello by way seeking star water good to

2710.359 --> 2712.5589999999997
see

2724.88 --> 2727.88
youh

2730.64 --> 2733.52
the air is very

2738.28 --> 2745.7200000000003
ni really hope that means that the

2741.28 --> 2745.7200000000003
driping from my ceiling is now going to

2754.88 --> 2759.6400000000003
stop

2756.8 --> 2761.6800000000003
I want to know why all maps are

2759.64 --> 2764.5989999999997
flat

2761.68 --> 2769.24
uh because all maps are

2764.599 --> 2772.44
created based of a flat

2769.24 --> 2776.68
plane an angle to that flat

2772.44 --> 2778.79
plane and that angle is versus a star

2776.68 --> 2783.0989999999997
that is part of the

2778.79 --> 2783.099
[Music]

2784.8 --> 2787.8
virtual

2794.64 --> 2798.1189999999997
yeah go [ __ ] yourself

2804.599 --> 2811.92
[ __ ]

2806.88 --> 2814.8
yeah right so maps are flat because

2811.92 --> 2820.119
of a flat plane

2814.8 --> 2823.28
angle to a star any of the stars on the

2820.119 --> 2826.359
virtual celestial

2823.28 --> 2830.28
sphere specifically of an angle from a

2826.359 --> 2830.2799999999997
flat plane to the celestial

2833.2 --> 2839.16
sphere that's how how that was created

2836.0 --> 2842.599
that's how the the map projections

2839.16 --> 2845.16
work now paper is flat that's cute of

2842.599 --> 2846.839
course of course paper is flat that

2845.16 --> 2851.5589999999997
that's nice

2846.839 --> 2854.7999999999997
but the way the map is constructed is an

2851.559 --> 2857.3190000000004
angle of a flat plane against the

2854.8 --> 2861.48
celestial

2857.319 --> 2863.96
sphere it's very specific

2861.48 --> 2866.8
process virtual celestial sphere yeah

2863.96 --> 2870.599
because it's not literally a sphere ter

2866.8 --> 2872.599
306 it's not anything the lights don't

2870.599 --> 2876.44
have an actual

2872.599 --> 2878.88
position it's just to the obs Observer

2876.44 --> 2880.839
will kind of seem like a sphere that

2878.88 --> 2882.76
surrounds you even though there's no

2880.839 --> 2887.599
sphere underneath your there's no stars

2882.76 --> 2887.599
underneath your feet ever

2888.599 --> 2894.44
visible so I kind of have to call it a

2891.8 --> 2896.6400000000003
virtual sphere or an apparent sphere

2894.44 --> 2901.48
it's not actually a

2896.64 --> 2904.24
sphere it just is visible to us like a

2901.48 --> 2907.04
sphere that surrounds

2904.24 --> 2910.16
us and then you take that sphere that

2907.04 --> 2912.96
seems to surround us and the angle of

2910.16 --> 2915.3999999999996
any part of that sphere usually a star

2912.96 --> 2918.2400000000002
you take that angle to the flat plane

2915.4 --> 2918.2400000000002
that you are standing

2921.8 --> 2928.8390000000004
on

2923.72 --> 2931.16
right established through like the

2928.839 --> 2934.319
Horizon all

2931.16 --> 2937.5989999999997
that or through water level however you

2934.319 --> 2937.599
want to do it

2944.44 --> 2947.68
yeah I of

2947.839 --> 2954.319
course I'm not laying out the

2951.4 --> 2957.2400000000002
exact measuring process if you want to

2954.319 --> 2959.799
listen to that whole detail thing

2957.24 --> 2963.4399999999996
just listen to one of 10th man's

2959.799 --> 2966.0
presentations okay he says it like every

2963.44 --> 2969.16
exact step of the process every exact

2966.0 --> 2974.559
word yeah that's I don't do that

2969.16 --> 2976.64
sorry I'm more here to like make it

2974.559 --> 2977.4
comprehensible so that you can kind of

2976.64 --> 2980.5989999999997
get

2977.4 --> 2982.76
a visual in your head oversight over

2980.599 --> 2985.52
what's really happening when they do it

2982.76 --> 2987.7200000000003
I I can't just like summarize every step

2985.52 --> 2987.72
and

2990.92 --> 2995.2000000000003
then because I'll get the names wrong

2993.359 --> 2997.7599999999998
mostly I know there's more steps to it

2995.2 --> 3001.16
I'll get the names

2997.76 --> 3002.559
wrong like dip correction like would be

3001.16 --> 3004.16
something that I could have said in

3002.559 --> 3007.0
there like oh dip correction with the

3004.16 --> 3008.92
Horizon The Horizon is going to be

3007.0 --> 3012.0
slightly

3008.92 --> 3013.44
above your eye level and that has a

3012.0 --> 3016.48
reason

3013.44 --> 3019.799
because blah blah blah you're standing

3016.48 --> 3019.799
on earth the earth is beneath

3023.48 --> 3028.04
you is that does that mean that Horizon

3026.24 --> 3031.1189999999997
slightly below I

3028.04 --> 3033.92
level ah I mean I'm mixing this [ __ ] up

3031.119 --> 3036.2000000000003
even so but the point is is that the

3033.92 --> 3038.0
overarching principle is that it's

3036.2 --> 3040.48
definitely being

3038.0 --> 3043.359
constructed on a flat plane and an angle

3040.48 --> 3046.359
to that flat plane you can't do that to

3043.359 --> 3048.799
a ball like you can't even attempt to do

3046.359 --> 3052.52
that you can't take an

3048.799 --> 3055.04
angle inside a ball to like the apparent

3052.52 --> 3056.7599999999998
celestial sphere and then have that

3055.04 --> 3061.24
angle

3056.76 --> 3065.92
tattered tied to a sphere because then

3061.24 --> 3070.52
you don't have an actual proper

3065.92 --> 3070.52
angle you can't use a curved

3070.68 --> 3075.2
Baseline like that it doesn't

3077.119 --> 3084.28
work they haven't constructed Maps like

3081.0 --> 3086.319
that they use a flat plane and an angle

3084.28 --> 3090.48
to that that's how they constructed the

3086.319 --> 3090.48
maps they can't do it on a

3094.28 --> 3097.28
sphere

3114.359 --> 3119.0789999999997
any

3116.4 --> 3122.2400000000002
sources that confirm that maps are made

3119.079 --> 3122.2400000000002
from measuring to

3123.839 --> 3129.68
Star

3126.2 --> 3132.1189999999997
again go and watch one of the older Flat

3129.68 --> 3134.8799999999997
Earth debates where 10th Man does

3132.119 --> 3137.119
presentations about this with sourcing

3134.88 --> 3137.119
and

3137.2 --> 3142.96
everything yes wrath I've heard of

3139.839 --> 3146.599
duper's delight I know that is a

3142.96 --> 3149.839
thing stop whining about duper

3146.599 --> 3153.6400000000003
herons yeah he's my protectorate like I

3149.839 --> 3156.68
don't care if he's an if a Fed an infr

3153.64 --> 3159.16
the secret even if he was secretly gay I

3156.68 --> 3161.48
don't give a [ __ ] I'm protecting him

3159.16 --> 3161.48
stop

3165.119 --> 3169.44
whining yeah see you indeed

3174.24 --> 3179.4399999999996
bye yeah at least he's actually having a

3177.4 --> 3183.559
conversation with me instead of only

3179.44 --> 3183.559
whining about what other people do in my

3204.16 --> 3207.16
chat

3211.599 --> 3217.04
H oh wow thanks for the thanks for the

3214.96 --> 3219.319
sourcing seeking star water that's

3217.04 --> 3219.319
really

3224.04 --> 3232.079
appreciated did no not his channel duper

3227.68 --> 3236.48
not his YouTube channel on Flat Earth

3232.079 --> 3240.799
debates Nathan Oakley Channel 10th Man

3236.48 --> 3245.2
did presentations on Flat Earth

3240.799 --> 3248.68
debates lots of them about Celestial

3245.2 --> 3253.68
navigation and how that works

3248.68 --> 3257.0
exactly the exact steps with the exact

3253.68 --> 3262.68
names something that I'm not super good

3257.0 --> 3262.68
at getting it so that exact that exact

3264.079 --> 3267.079
sorry

3324.0 --> 3327.0
h

3343.72 --> 3347.16
hey steamy traveler good to see

3354.0 --> 3357.0
you

3369.079 --> 3374.8390000000004
that duper you could also just go in the

3372.68 --> 3378.319
video

3374.839 --> 3383.68
list live streams or

3378.319 --> 3386.92
uploads and just search on maps or

3383.68 --> 3386.9199999999996
Celestial navigation

3389.76 --> 3395.7200000000003
just search on the word you're going to

3392.559 --> 3398.6800000000003
have hits on that word within all those

3395.72 --> 3401.16
videos it's a very quick way to actually

3398.68 --> 3404.8799999999997
try to find a video it's almost like

3401.16 --> 3407.92
Google searching it except you're just

3404.88 --> 3408.96
keyword searching it in your search bar

3407.92 --> 3413.88
of

3408.96 --> 3416.88
your of your browser that's the

3413.88 --> 3416.88
difference

3426.119 --> 3432.559
right just take your browser contrl

3429.64 --> 3434.7599999999998
F right what happens when you or uh what

3432.559 --> 3438.079
is it yeah contrl F what happens when

3434.76 --> 3441.079
you do contrl F you get this little bar

3438.079 --> 3442.799
it says find in page and then you you

3441.079 --> 3447.52
type in the word

3442.799 --> 3451.2
map right and then you do that in the

3447.52 --> 3453.72
folder of YouTube of Nathan Oakley's

3451.2 --> 3457.16
Channel where you get a big list with

3453.72 --> 3460.1189999999997
the titles and then you click

3457.16 --> 3462.16
enter and then it highlights all those

3460.119 --> 3464.28
videos within the page you might have to

3462.16 --> 3466.359
like scroll all the way down to to say

3464.28 --> 3468.48
show more or

3466.359 --> 3472.16
something or you might want to scroll

3468.48 --> 3474.48
through all as many videos as you can

3472.16 --> 3476.44
and then you just click enter on that

3474.48 --> 3479.64
search search bar finding page and then

3476.44 --> 3483.2400000000002
you find those words in the titles of

3479.64 --> 3483.24
the videos very

3487.079 --> 3493.4
quickly I know everybody these days just

3489.799 --> 3497.92
like CH GPT could you find something for

3493.4 --> 3501.76
me yeah yeah I I use the find in Page

3497.92 --> 3506.7200000000003
search system like it's very 90s very

3501.76 --> 3506.7200000000003
early 2000s but it works great still

3516.559 --> 3521.559
whatever happened to T yeah he's in he's

3519.2 --> 3524.5989999999997
got family troubles steaming Traver like

3521.559 --> 3524.599
his wife got really

3526.2 --> 3531.48
sick so he's like spending all his time

3529.319 --> 3533.72
taking care of her I think and doesn't

3531.48 --> 3536.72
have time for

3533.72 --> 3536.72
fed

3538.359 --> 3543.119
I think I heard recently that she is

3541.079 --> 3547.1600000000003
doing a bit better so that 10th man

3543.119 --> 3547.1600000000003
might come back

3550.96 --> 3555.52
somewhere this year so but we'll

3555.68 --> 3562.0
see you think Dr Shiva is not doing live

3559.44 --> 3566.64
I was wondering that

3562.0 --> 3566.64
teret I don't see him anymore

3568.0 --> 3573.64
I don't know what's happening maybe he's

3570.039 --> 3573.6400000000003
sick maybe he got

3576.24 --> 3580.7599999999998
sick but yeah that's a good now that you

3579.079 --> 3584.1600000000003
now that you're mentioning a ter yeah

3580.76 --> 3586.599
I've noticed that Dr Shiva videos aren't

3584.16 --> 3586.5989999999997
like in

3586.839 --> 3592.16
my in my notifications anymore

3592.44 --> 3597.359
H but that happened pretty recent

3594.599 --> 3599.6800000000003
recently I ter I think that he's just

3597.359 --> 3602.92
got gotten sick I mean a lot of people

3599.68 --> 3602.9199999999996
out there have gotten sick

3604.24 --> 3609.72
recently so holidays yeah perhaps

3607.599 --> 3611.7200000000003
holidays and maybe he got sick I mean

3609.72 --> 3613.5989999999997
it's very common for very hardworking

3611.72 --> 3617.2799999999997
people is that oh they take a vacation

3613.599 --> 3619.96
holiday and then they get sick it always

3617.28 --> 3619.96
happened to my

3620.119 --> 3625.1600000000003
mom cuz you're just so busy and then you

3622.92 --> 3627.039
stop being that busy and then suddenly

3625.16 --> 3629.92
everything creeps up on you and then you

3627.039 --> 3632.28
get sick very

3629.92 --> 3634.96
quick I've been really sick in the past

3632.28 --> 3638.48
week yeah Jo I bet you were and did you

3634.96 --> 3643.559
hear Neil centino yesterday God we

3638.48 --> 3643.559
didn't even recognize his voice was that

3650.64 --> 3658.4
bad using a sexon on when it is is not

3654.96 --> 3661.119
calm is so yeah but I mean doing almost

3658.4 --> 3664.76
anything on a boat when it when the when

3661.119 --> 3667.559
the sea is restless is is a hassle I'd

3664.76 --> 3667.559
say who

3683.44 --> 3686.44
Kramers

3688.079 --> 3690.48
hey

3701.4 --> 3709.52
joing oh need a need it needs to be flat

3706.76 --> 3712.3190000000004
or no it's not like that Tommy it's just

3709.52 --> 3715.359
you use the

3712.319 --> 3718.24
Horizon and it's especially about the

3715.359 --> 3722.279
consistency of the Horizon so you move

3718.24 --> 3725.8799999999997
around well the Horizon is exactly

3722.279 --> 3729.52
alike and you don't change like axis

3725.88 --> 3733.92
orientation at all it's literally like

3729.52 --> 3733.92
like that that's in the way it's a flat

3739.2 --> 3744.4399999999996
plane it's always use the flat plane

3742.0 --> 3748.72
you're on and then the angle to the stop

3744.44 --> 3751.88
or wherever it may be right but that's

3748.72 --> 3756.1189999999997
that the flat plane stays exactly as it

3751.88 --> 3758.2400000000002
is and parallel everywhere is what makes

3756.119 --> 3762.079
the angle to the star of the celestial

3758.24 --> 3765.5989999999997
sphere at every position a reliable

3762.079 --> 3771.52
consistent measurement as

3765.599 --> 3771.52
in because it's flat that's why it's

3773.359 --> 3780.96
mappable

3776.279 --> 3780.96
no you don't use a vertical Plum

3782.119 --> 3785.4
dumbass the

3790.24 --> 3796.2
[ __ ] definitely don't use a vertical

3792.92 --> 3796.2000000000003
Plum with Celestial

3802.16 --> 3806.72
navigation oh I'm sure you've lit done

3804.88 --> 3808.079
it yeah you don't use a plum in

3806.72 --> 3810.72
Celestial

3808.079 --> 3815.7200000000003
navigation cuz that's pointless on a on

3810.72 --> 3817.24
a moving ship it's pointless to do

3815.72 --> 3820.279
that

3817.24 --> 3823.319
cuz it's going to keep

3820.279 --> 3824.4
moving it's just like a a water level or

3823.319 --> 3828.0
a

3824.4 --> 3831.76
bubble doesn't work on God damn it this

3828.0 --> 3836.279
[ __ ] monitor keeps glitching on me

3831.76 --> 3836.279
stop [ __ ] glitching like a [ __ ]

3837.88 --> 3843.0
[Music]

3840.68 --> 3847.5589999999997
that's more like

3843.0 --> 3847.559
it that's not true yeah it is true

3853.0 --> 3860.48
[ __ ] yeah on a rocking boat you don't

3856.0 --> 3864.24
use a bubble you don't use anything like

3860.48 --> 3866.119
that because that only works on land

3864.24 --> 3868.8799999999997
where the ground underneath your feet

3866.119 --> 3872.2000000000003
isn't moving continually

3868.88 --> 3874.2000000000003
idiot what you can use however on the

3872.2 --> 3878.16
ocean the one thing that's really

3874.2 --> 3879.799
reliable no matter how much you move is

3878.16 --> 3883.319
the

3879.799 --> 3886.079
Horizon which always stays in place no

3883.319 --> 3887.839
matter how Wild the ocean

3886.079 --> 3893.1600000000003
is

3887.839 --> 3895.119
yeah you definitely don't use a

3893.16 --> 3899.279
bubble

3895.119 --> 3902.079
or or a plum or anything like that on a

3899.279 --> 3907.16
rocking ocean is

3902.079 --> 3911.2400000000002
ridiculous those tools are only only

3907.16 --> 3911.24
used on

3911.64 --> 3916.8799999999997
land anybody that says otherwise is a

3918.16 --> 3929.0389999999998
liar yeah was definitely not a standard

3923.48 --> 3933.2400000000002
C fairing tool a plum definitely not a

3929.039 --> 3936.119
standard sea fairing tool they don't use

3933.24 --> 3938.7599999999998
plums you know who uses plums people who

3936.119 --> 3942.2400000000002
build ships on

3938.76 --> 3944.3190000000004
land yeah they build them on land and

3942.24 --> 3948.1189999999997
that's where they use the

3944.319 --> 3949.92
plums you don't use it on the ocean

3948.119 --> 3953.079
because it keeps moving because the

3949.92 --> 3956.079
freaking ocean keeps

3953.079 --> 3956.079
moving

3962.92 --> 3969.96
you must ensure an elevision angle yeah

3965.96 --> 3973.319
no not on a vertical Plum [ __ ]

3969.96 --> 3976.319
liar luk Kramers the

3973.319 --> 3976.319
liar

3979.279 --> 3983.0
huh I'm sure it's true because you made

3981.76 --> 3986.0
it up

3983.0 --> 3986.0
yourself

3999.079 --> 4005.599
oh really Joe King that's

4001.96 --> 4007.88
interesting yeah ships built by hand it

4005.599 --> 4007.88
still

4008.4 --> 4017.119
happens and the the ways that is done is

4013.0 --> 4020.2
kept Alive by basically historically

4017.119 --> 4023.079
interested reenactment type crowds which

4020.2 --> 4025.279
there's a lot of those people

4023.079 --> 4028.0
apparently and they make a lot of TV

4025.279 --> 4028.0
shows and

4036.599 --> 4041.2000000000003
stuff want to see your SE

4042.92 --> 4045.92
no

4058.0 --> 4063.599
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4060.0 --> 4065.559
Tommy how sex work I yeah I have been

4063.599 --> 4068.96
discussing this for years I haven't used

4065.559 --> 4070.079
sexon for years but I have been sitting

4068.96 --> 4074.7200000000003
through

4070.079 --> 4077.6400000000003
like at least 500 n not

4074.72 --> 4079.799
200 presentations of 10 men endlessly

4077.64 --> 4081.5989999999997
talking about the Sextant where it I got

4079.799 --> 4083.68
sick of it but it's like I'm sitting

4081.599 --> 4085.279
through it because I have to get it I

4083.68 --> 4086.96
have to understand what's going on I

4085.279 --> 4089.279
have to understand every time somebody

4086.96 --> 4092.92
talks about it what's happening instead

4089.279 --> 4095.359
of completely getting lost which is like

4092.92 --> 4097.88
the first 30 years of my life every time

4095.359 --> 4099.5599999999995
Celestial navigation was brought up

4097.88 --> 4101.04
thought it was one of the most confusing

4099.56 --> 4104.52
freaking things

4101.04 --> 4108.159
ever for some reason but yeah sitting

4104.52 --> 4110.839000000001

4108.159 --> 4113.639999999999
it it did

4110.839 --> 4115.88
really set it straight what's really

4113.64 --> 4115.88
going

4115.92 --> 4122.4
on yeah and one thing that's definitely

4118.6 --> 4125.679
not going on is that Celestial

4122.4 --> 4127.879999999999
Navigators use a plum that's a straight

4125.679 --> 4131.92
out

4127.88 --> 4135.799
lie it's never done

4131.92 --> 4135.799

and does not have to be plum

4613.76 --> 4617.88

4631.12 --> 4633.679
going to hold

4633.8 --> 4639.1990000000005
it cuz you're going to be focusing one

4637.239 --> 4643.04
of the mirrors on that thing no matter

4639.199 --> 4645.879999999999
how you hold it on the horizon that's

4672.6 --> 4677.4800000000005
it it helped help me to point to be able

4674.52 --> 4680.159000000001
to point at the things that don't belong

4677.48 --> 4682.28
there so right so somebody saying oh you

4680.159 --> 4685.28
need to have the plum it's like that's

4682.28 --> 4687.5199999999995
almost a universally reasonable thing to

4685.28 --> 4688.759999999999
say it's like yeah if you don't really

4687.52 --> 4690.719
know what it's about it's like oh yeah

4688.76 --> 4694.4400000000005
maybe you do need to do

4690.719 --> 4694.44
that but no you

4696.96 --> 4704.8
don't I would have remembered hearing

4699.76 --> 4707.0
the word plum a lot in 10 man

4704.8 --> 4710.84
presentations it didn't it's not in

4707.0 --> 4710.84
there though I would have remembered

4712.56 --> 4716.679
that how does a sexon work in a

4715.0 --> 4718.88
mountainous region or wooden area where

4716.679 --> 4723.159
you can see yeah exactly steamy traveler

4718.88 --> 4726.96
yeah that's where you use it on

4723.159 --> 4731.28
land that's right when you use a section

4726.96 --> 4734.12
on land you should probably use a bubble

4731.28 --> 4737.5199999999995
or a plum because you can't see the

4734.12 --> 4740.159
Horizon you can't be 100% sure right and

4737.52 --> 4741.6
hey the ground is not moving all around

4740.159 --> 4744.04
so it's like oh yeah you could just put

4741.6 --> 4745.84
it down and it's like oh that's really

4744.04 --> 4750.44
perfectly stable yeah because it's not

4745.84 --> 4755.8
rocking like a boat you can use it on

4750.44 --> 4758.719
land Plum a bubble on land that's right

4755.8 --> 4761.84
not on the ocean though definitely not

4758.719 --> 4764.84
on the ocean it's definitely not used

4761.84 --> 4764.84
there

4781.32 --> 4787.12
1827 videos putting in work oh

4791.48 --> 4796.799999999999
thanks although putting in work

4794.679 --> 4798.88
maintenance putting in maintenance I'd

4796.8 --> 4802.0
say I mean it's not like every day I

4798.88 --> 4805.679
have like this enormous elaborate video

4802.0 --> 4807.639
presentation to show you but I am always

4805.679 --> 4809.4800000000005
here and I'm always ready I'm always

4807.639 --> 4811.679
ready to like talk unless I feel like

4809.48 --> 4813.12
super terrible for some reason which has

4811.679 --> 4815.2390000000005
happened as well I mean it's what

4813.12 --> 4817.48
happens when you do a show every damn

4815.239 --> 4820.879999999999
day for almost a

4817.48 --> 4820.879999999999
decade but

4821.76 --> 4827.76
uh

4823.36 --> 4830.92
I'm always here I keep track I get very

4827.76 --> 4834.360000000001
sharp I Can't Get Fooled Again right

4830.92 --> 4837.04
eventually You Can Get Fooled Again now

4834.36 --> 4838.5199999999995
like if you'd ask me like two years ago

4837.04 --> 4841.159
like oh yeah you have to oh whenit

4838.52 --> 4842.84
you're on a ship you have to know Plum

4841.159 --> 4846.199
for Celestial navigation I'd probably

4842.84 --> 4847.719
say like yeah yeah yeah sure now I know

4846.199 --> 4851.919999999999
like uh

4847.719 --> 4853.56
no no you don't now I know I it doesn't

4851.92 --> 4856.639
work like that you can't can't get fool

4853.56 --> 4860.400000000001
again I you can't fool me with

4856.639 --> 4860.400000000001
that I know how this

4862.36 --> 4869.48
works and I bet that

4866.239 --> 4872.5599999999995
uh Luke Kramer's there really believes

4869.48 --> 4874.799999999999
it I mean he's probably doubled down on

4872.56 --> 4876.52
this being a thing for himself so much

4874.8 --> 4880.84
that he's like he's just going to double

4876.52 --> 4880.84
down even when it's provably

4881.639 --> 4888.04
wrong

4883.199 --> 4890.04
right when you throw so much down for it

4888.04 --> 4893.5199999999995
then when it just turn out to be

4890.04 --> 4895.639
completely wrong it's more feasible for

4893.52 --> 4899.400000000001
your own Spirit to just keep pretending

4895.639 --> 4901.96
like it is real than to actually admit

4899.4 --> 4901.96
utter

4902.48 --> 4907.759999999999
defeat that you should have never moved

4905.8 --> 4910.28
into that position you he should have

4907.76 --> 4912.6
never maneuvered himself there but he

4910.28 --> 4914.679
did and then it's going to be very hum

4912.6 --> 4916.639
humiliating to to recognize that for

4914.679 --> 4921.52
himself it's probably just going to keep

4916.639 --> 4923.84
doubling down and definitely not sending

4921.52 --> 4928.6
me that

4923.84 --> 4928.6
email nope no

4938.679 --> 4943.1990000000005
email he bet the house did he not really

4941.84 --> 4945.28
sure what you're talking

4943.199 --> 4949.28
no he didn't literally bet the house he

4945.28 --> 4949.28
just he bet his own ego on

4952.04 --> 4957.44
it no but what happened is

4956.0 --> 4960.639
[Applause]

4957.44 --> 4963.239
that so Luke Kramer he just said like oh

4960.639 --> 4966.719
no you definitely when you use a sexon

4963.239 --> 4967.5199999999995
you need to establish Plum that's what

4966.719 --> 4970.52
he

4967.52 --> 4971.56
said when you use a seent and it's just

4970.52 --> 4973.639
not

4971.56 --> 4976.1990000000005
true

4973.639 --> 4978.84
you only need to establish Plum or use a

4976.199 --> 4981.919999999999
bubble or whatever when you can't see

4978.84 --> 4983.719
the Horizon and and on land yeah if you

4981.92 --> 4985.4400000000005
can't see the Horizon when you're on a

4983.719 --> 4988.4
ship at

4985.44 --> 4991.879999999999
Sea give let me give you a hint you're

4988.4 --> 4993.759999999999
[ __ ] you're just [ __ ] then like you

4991.88 --> 4997.12
can't see the Horizon and you're on a

4993.76 --> 4999.4400000000005
ship yeah good [ __ ]

4997.12 --> 5001.48
luck I mean that's just not going to

4999.44 --> 5005.5199999999995
happen

5001.48 --> 5007.599999999999
then right you go to be on the ship you

5005.52 --> 5009.76
got to see the horizon or no point

5007.6 --> 5011.76
there's no point in doing Celestial

5009.76 --> 5014.92
navigation right it's too Misty

5011.76 --> 5014.92
everywhere just no

5017.679 --> 5025.84
point but on land yeah on land you can

5023.159 --> 5028.199
definitely use a

5025.84 --> 5031.84
bubble or or a

5028.199 --> 5034.08
plum right to figure out Plum to get it

5031.84 --> 5036.360000000001
exactly level and then do Celestial

5034.08 --> 5039.12
navigation even when you don't see the

5036.36 --> 5043.719
Horizon on the ship that doesn't really

5039.12 --> 5046.5199999999995
work cuz you're moving you can perfectly

5043.719 --> 5047.84
establish PL pum it's going to be moving

5046.52 --> 5050.88
all over the place you're going to like

5047.84 --> 5057.28
oh let me try to figure out exactly how

5050.88 --> 5061.36
many degrees like ah I can't see it it's

5057.28 --> 5062.92
we're somewhere between South Africa and

5061.36 --> 5065.759999999999
Brazil

5062.92 --> 5067.32
is that is that detailed enough right

5065.76 --> 5070.56
that that's like the result you'd get

5067.32 --> 5072.88
out of that it's like not very accurate

5070.56 --> 5074.76
you got to see The Horizon it's very

5072.88 --> 5076.8
simple you're on the ship if you don't

5074.76 --> 5079.96
see the Horizon you can't Celestial

5076.8 --> 5079.96
navigate you just

5090.199 --> 5095.159
can't how do the navigat is use the seon

5093.119 --> 5097.32
if they're on the ocean I just explained

5095.159 --> 5100.5199999999995
that duper I literally just explained

5097.32 --> 5104.799999999999
that they use the

5100.52 --> 5107.1990000000005
Horizon yeah take the seon point one of

5104.8 --> 5109.119000000001
the mirrors at the Horizon the other at

5107.199 --> 5111.44
the sun that's usually one of the

5109.119 --> 5114.239
processes very

5111.44 --> 5117.4
important at daytime at night time you

5114.239 --> 5120.919999999999
take a certain star probably Polaris

5117.4 --> 5123.199
would be very popular to orient first

5120.92 --> 5124.52
like what the what is it the latitude

5123.199 --> 5126.239
you're

5124.52 --> 5130.040000000001
on

5126.239 --> 5132.239
roughly you take the

5130.04 --> 5133.639
Horizon and then you take the angle to

5132.239 --> 5135.879999999999
the

5133.639 --> 5139.96
star with that

5135.88 --> 5139.96
Horizon but you do it with the

5144.239 --> 5148.759999999999
Horizon all right and if you're on a

5146.32 --> 5152.32
moving ship well you can keep your

5148.76 --> 5154.119000000001
balance as long as you can it's like

5152.32 --> 5157.28
like you can use your own balancing

5154.119 --> 5159.599999999999
organs to keep the Horizon stable even

5157.28 --> 5162.44
when your body is moving underneath it

5159.6 --> 5165.360000000001
because the bu boat is rocking you can

5162.44 --> 5167.36
use your balance organ to literally keep

5165.36 --> 5170.119
it tethered to the

5167.36 --> 5173.0
Horizon you can't do that with a bubble

5170.119 --> 5175.239
it's just too

5173.0 --> 5178.4
difficult but if you have something

5175.239 --> 5181.28
visual to lock onto like the Horizon

5178.4 --> 5184.199
then you can do that even if the boat is

5181.28 --> 5184.199
moving

5186.44 --> 5190.48
unless you have a terrible inner ear

5188.679 --> 5192.679
then yeah good luck with it but you're

5190.48 --> 5197.599999999999
not going to go on the ship if you have

5192.679 --> 5197.6
a terrible inner a that would be a

5210.719 --> 5215.199
nightmare like a give

5213.56 --> 5218.360000000001
gimbo

5215.199 --> 5221.119
right yeah and hey if you have a gimball

5218.36 --> 5224.32
then you can use that device instead of

5221.119 --> 5227.4
you keeping the balance to do that right

5224.32 --> 5230.5199999999995
put it in the gimbal but technically

5227.4 --> 5233.36
yeah I mean if you don't have all those

5230.52 --> 5235.719
Advanced equipments you're just kind of

5233.36 --> 5238.599999999999
a poor sailor all you got is a seon well

5235.719 --> 5242.96
you can do it still with only just that

5238.6 --> 5246.0
seon and well Maps or very very precise

5242.96 --> 5248.4800000000005
knowledge in your head about it that's

5246.0 --> 5251.119
might be difficult but the point is is

5248.48 --> 5253.0
that you can still do it with relatively

5251.119 --> 5255.28
primitive equipment that's what made it

5253.0 --> 5255.28
so

5265.44 --> 5271.48
powerful makes sense oh glad yeah I'm

5268.4 --> 5273.599999999999
glad I mean it is comp it's it's

5271.48 --> 5277.159
complicated to get it in your head

5273.6 --> 5281.280000000001
straight took me a very long it took me

5277.159 --> 5283.32
200 tenth man presentations okay I mean

5281.28 --> 5285.88
seriously at the beginning of those

5283.32 --> 5288.239
presentations I had no idea what they

5285.88 --> 5291.6
were talking about I had literally

5288.239 --> 5294.5199999999995
trouble tuning myself into

5291.6 --> 5296.719
it but after a while I just started to

5294.52 --> 5298.52
recognize the same word over and over

5296.719 --> 5302.199
and started to see patterns and then

5298.52 --> 5304.719
suddenly is like oh I just oh man it

5302.199 --> 5307.159
only took 50 10th Man presentations and

5304.719 --> 5308.159
I think I finally get it now it was kind

5307.159 --> 5312.638999999999
of like

5308.159 --> 5315.92
that because it's

5312.639 --> 5319.719
tough on the

5315.92 --> 5321.76
mind to get into it it's like usually

5319.719 --> 5323.679
when you learn something you just have

5321.76 --> 5325.56
to go through a couple of steps then you

5323.679 --> 5327.4
know the trick and then you get into the

5325.56 --> 5330.8
trick and then you are the trick you get

5327.4 --> 5333.119
it with this it's like there's a couple

5330.8 --> 5335.8
of more things you need to like really

5333.119 --> 5337.599999999999
understand and Orient yourself with and

5335.8 --> 5340.84
if you don't get all those steps

5337.6 --> 5345.96
straight it's like mumbo jumbo talk to

5340.84 --> 5348.08
you it's like ah weird astrology stuff

5345.96 --> 5351.04
is probably what you'll designate it as

5348.08 --> 5354.48
this what I used to do that it's just

5351.04 --> 5356.08
weird astrology stuff but just because

5354.48 --> 5358.599999999999
I've just been through these

5356.08 --> 5362.5599999999995
presentations and all the

5358.6 --> 5366.08
steps having heard them every time

5362.56 --> 5366.080000000001
I think yeah I get it

5373.0 --> 5377.28
now yeah Richard yeah you've said you've

5375.88 --> 5380.92
been

5377.28 --> 5385.119
there and yes it did get

5380.92 --> 5388.639
boring it did but it was very useful it

5385.119 --> 5390.679
helped a lot despite being

5388.639 --> 5392.56
boring because it's just one of those

5390.679 --> 5394.52
subject that needed to be repeat it over

5392.56 --> 5398.080000000001
and over and over again because it's so

5394.52 --> 5400.360000000001
hard to get in there get in your

5398.08 --> 5403.48
head it was for

5400.36 --> 5408.159
me but it's there I got it I got most of

5403.48 --> 5410.48
it I might not be using the perfect

5408.159 --> 5414.159
wording or I might miss a little step

5410.48 --> 5418.599999999999
here and there but I definitely get the

5414.159 --> 5421.119
wider gist of it all I know roughly how

5418.6 --> 5422.4400000000005
it all works I won't like say anything

5421.119 --> 5427.48
that's like complet completely AG

5422.44 --> 5427.48
graciously wrong about it I'm pretty

5429.96 --> 5436.36
sure is that email in my inbox yet let

5434.04 --> 5436.36
me

5437.48 --> 5440.48
refresh

5450.679 --> 5455.76
nope my he probably read through it and

5453.44 --> 5458.4
then he realized like oh yeah what Arn

5455.76 --> 5460.88
says is exactly right it probably read

5458.4 --> 5462.679
keeping it Plum then he realized oh

5460.88 --> 5465.32
that's actually the section of where it

5462.679 --> 5466.56
describes on how to use it on land when

5465.32 --> 5469.759999999999
you don't see the

5466.56 --> 5473.0
Horizon and just realized like oh [ __ ]

5469.76 --> 5475.639
everything I tried to just claim he

5473.0 --> 5477.8
roboted like almost forbit him what's

5475.639 --> 5480.4400000000005
written down here so he's definitely not

5477.8 --> 5484.360000000001
going to email me that evidence that I

5480.44 --> 5486.799999999999
probably got it right for batim when he

5484.36 --> 5491.5199999999995
it's his

5486.8 --> 5491.52
Source what's Plum with a

5491.679 --> 5494.679
be

5496.08 --> 5500.44
doer Plum is like

5500.52 --> 5507.1990000000005
level to keep it like perfectly vertical

5505.08 --> 5508.239
right Plum you take a string you have a

5507.199 --> 5512.638999999999
weight on the

5508.239 --> 5513.879999999999
string you you leave it hanging if it's

5512.639 --> 5516.8
it's going to go straight down

5513.88 --> 5516.8
eventually that's

5517.52 --> 5525.719
Plum yeah the plum Bob plump Bob a plum

5523.199 --> 5527.678999999999
Bob and then you can get Plum which you

5525.719 --> 5530.88
can also use a

5527.679 --> 5535.6
bubble to get Plum so all these things

5530.88 --> 5537.84
but yeah a plum Bob is the most easy to

5535.6 --> 5537.84
get

5540.04 --> 5545.4
Plum so it's like

5543.08 --> 5549.08
to find level

5545.4 --> 5551.96
Plum is like the vertical counterpart of

5549.08 --> 5551.96
level which is

5555.88 --> 5560.88
horizontal right so been Celestial

5558.28 --> 5562.28
navigation you need that horizontal if

5560.88 --> 5564.56
you can't get it because you don't see

5562.28 --> 5567.28
the Horizon then you need the vertical

5564.56 --> 5570.2390000000005
you need Plum but you can't really get

5567.28 --> 5572.36
that vertical if you're moving

5570.239 --> 5574.759999999999
around but

5572.36 --> 5576.679
yeah so on the ocean you can't use that

5574.76 --> 5578.119000000001
for you really have to use the Horizon

5576.679 --> 5579.719
if you don't see the Horizon you're just

5578.119 --> 5583.48
screwed you have to wait until you can

5579.719 --> 5586.36
see it but on land you're not moving

5583.48 --> 5589.32
around and then well you have mountains

5586.36 --> 5592.08
and whatever so the occasion where you

5589.32 --> 5594.5199999999995
can see the Horizon might arrive on

5592.08 --> 5596.5199999999995
average much more than on the ocean

5594.52 --> 5598.92
where on average going to be looking at

5596.52 --> 5603.52
the Horizon on the

5598.92 --> 5606.4
ocean and the land you can use that Plum

5603.52 --> 5609.92
or Plum Bob or whatever to establish

5606.4 --> 5611.5599999999995
Plum and then use that to with the

5609.92 --> 5612.679
celestial navigation because you can't

5611.56 --> 5615.639
see the

5612.679 --> 5618.7
Horizon but it only works because the

5615.639 --> 5620.76
land is not rocking back and

5618.7 --> 5623.719
[Music]

5620.76 --> 5625.88
forth yeah you can't use Celestial

5623.719 --> 5629.28
navigation on land if you don't see the

5625.88 --> 5633.56
Horizon and there's an ongoing

5629.28 --> 5633.5599999999995
earthquake it's not going to work

5660.48 --> 5663.48
h

5667.86 --> 5670.96
[Applause]

5699.76 --> 5703.92
let's start the title off with

5706.199 --> 5711.638999999999
this yeah exactly see can start word

5720.4 --> 5723.4
thanks

5740.15 --> 5743.339999999999
[Music]

5750.4 --> 5753.4
m

5771.48 --> 5778.159
all right anyhow damn it that coffee was

5774.08 --> 5778.159
gone very quickly I want another

5780.32 --> 5785.759999999999
one

5782.719 --> 5785.76
look at this

5787.6 --> 5794.96
beautiful

5790.159 --> 5794.96
wintry yellowy colored light

5798.52 --> 5805.040000000001
amazing cam is not picking it up as good

5803.119 --> 5808.32
as my eyes

5805.04 --> 5810.28
are but you can see the warm color of

5808.32 --> 5813.28
it

5810.28 --> 5813.28
right

5820.0 --> 5825.84
email sent oh my God he actually did

5823.239 --> 5829.5599999999995
it oh here we

5825.84 --> 5829.56
go took you long

5840.199 --> 5845.199
enough

5842.679 --> 5845.1990000000005
what the

5851.639 --> 5858.4400000000005
[ __ ] are you seriously giving me a

5854.76 --> 5858.4400000000005
freaking chat GPT

5858.48 --> 5862.08
answer that's not a

5862.76 --> 5869.56
source that's not a source [ __ ]

5866.8 --> 5873.1990000000005
you're [ __ ] banned get the [ __ ] out

5869.56 --> 5873.1990000000005
of here

5876.76 --> 5879.119000000001
[ __ ]

5893.599 --> 5899.76
you you want me to show you what he

5896.52 --> 5904.360000000001
freaking sent me this is pathetic

5899.76 --> 5904.360000000001
it's it's really really

5906.92 --> 5912.679
terrible it's the full bolard workings

5909.92 --> 5915.08
it's it's the horeshit story it's

5912.679 --> 5916.4
exactly the crap he just rolled out and

5915.08 --> 5921.04
he's got it

5916.4 --> 5924.5599999999995
wrong so chat GPT is a piece of

5921.04 --> 5928.199
[ __ ] A programmed known

5924.56 --> 5929.719
liar and a ballar deceiver

5928.199 --> 5932.5199999999995
misinformation

5929.719 --> 5935.56
Placer so yeah that's not going to work

5932.52 --> 5938.1990000000005
you're going to have to actually use a

5935.56 --> 5939.84
reference of an

5938.199 --> 5941.5599999999995
actual

5939.84 --> 5947.159000000001
user

5941.56 --> 5950.679
manual and not some [ __ ] AI inquiry

5947.159 --> 5957.5599999999995
[ __ ] did I ask you for a chat GPT

5950.679 --> 5962.28
roll out [ __ ] no I asked you for the

5957.56 --> 5966.719
manual [ __ ] who's banned

5962.28 --> 5966.719
now after wasting my time so

5990.04 --> 5993.04
much

6001.88 --> 6008.159000000001
yeah it's balart

6004.639 --> 6010.32
Liars yeah that's why jet GPT because

6008.159 --> 6012.4
it's the new anti Flat Earth

6010.32 --> 6014.44
programming right so now suddenly

6012.4 --> 6017.199
selestial navigation according to chat

6014.44 --> 6019.96
GPT yeah you need the vertical you need

6017.199 --> 6024.5599999999995
the vertical why because

6019.96 --> 6027.96
horizontal doesn't exist on a

6024.56 --> 6031.56
ball yeah so you always have to go for

6027.96 --> 6034.36
the vertical every time horizontal is

6031.56 --> 6036.679
not relevant anymore because it can't be

6034.36 --> 6038.44
in the right place so you just always

6036.679 --> 6041.8
need the vertical no matter what the

6038.44 --> 6045.119
Horizon's Just an Illusion now yeah and

6041.8 --> 6047.96
that's what this chat GPT crap is

6045.119 --> 6051.28
promoting it's the same crap all the

6047.96 --> 6053.36
anti flat earthers are trying to push

6051.28 --> 6056.32
the new

6053.36 --> 6059.0
adapted misinformation campaign about

6056.32 --> 6062.719
Celestial navigation where you

6059.0 --> 6066.719
definitely don't start out establishing

6062.719 --> 6069.679
a vertical you establish a

6066.719 --> 6073.04
horizontal that's how you started and

6069.679 --> 6078.0
that's what you read in the

6073.04 --> 6081.679
actual printed paper Celestial

6078.0 --> 6086.04
navigation user manual

6081.679 --> 6089.8
and not a [ __ ] chat GPT

6086.04 --> 6089.8
inquiry yeah dip

6090.719 --> 6097.4800000000005
[ __ ] yeah that same chat

6093.48 --> 6101.879999999999
GPT also tells you like the most

6097.48 --> 6104.919999999999
disproven horeshit imaginable yeah

6101.88 --> 6108.679
things that are provably

6104.92 --> 6111.8
lies it's not a good source dumbass I

6108.679 --> 6117.0
know you're too [ __ ] lazy to do

6111.8 --> 6117.0
anything beyond ask the robot at this

6119.239 --> 6126.08
point but yeah next time when I ask for

6123.04 --> 6133.28
oh show me the manual you have to show

6126.08 --> 6136.88
me the manual and not a chat GPT inquiry

6133.28 --> 6139.759999999999
yeah and that's why you're banned now

6136.88 --> 6142.76
and shall remain

6139.76 --> 6142.76
so

6164.159 --> 6170.839999999999
it actually says in that in the chat GPT

6167.4 --> 6173.638999999999
hor [ __ ] version at number six you you

6170.84 --> 6177.0
need a stable platform otherwise it

6173.639 --> 6180.0
might be affect the alignment yeah no

6177.0 --> 6180.0
[ __ ]

6181.18 --> 6184.289000000001
[Music]

6185.639 --> 6192.52
[ __ ] yeah so according to Chad jpt

6190.0 --> 6196.52
you just can't use Celestial navigation

6192.52 --> 6198.360000000001
on a ship right it's just too hard cuz

6196.52 --> 6200.88
you really need that stable platform

6198.36 --> 6203.5599999999995
what might affect the alignment yeah

6200.88 --> 6207.32
yeah yeah you [ __ ] [ __ ] that's why

6203.56 --> 6209.96
you don't use the vertical on selestial

6207.32 --> 6213.88
navigation you use the

6209.96 --> 6217.199
horizontal so you can tether yourself

6213.88 --> 6218.599
using your inner ear to the Horizon

6217.199 --> 6221.28
which stays stable as the boat is

6218.599 --> 6224.88
rocking underneath you yeah that's why

6221.28 --> 6226.5599999999995
you don't use Plum or a vertical when

6224.88 --> 6230.4400000000005
you're on the

6226.56 --> 6234.360000000001
ocean you use the horizontal the thing

6230.44 --> 6236.5599999999995
that always stays horizontal no much no

6234.36 --> 6239.08
matter how much this the ocean is

6236.56 --> 6242.0
rocking the ship you're standing on

6239.08 --> 6242.0
that's the entire

6255.159 --> 6262.08
point I just show this [ __ ] I'll just

6258.08 --> 6265.8
show you for a second

6262.08 --> 6265.8
instead of just telling you all the

6267.48 --> 6270.959999999999
time what

6274.44 --> 6277.879999999999
no there you

6278.239 --> 6287.36
go uh okay now let's get this freaking

6282.92 --> 6287.36
thing out of the way there you

6289.28 --> 6297.28
go right so here's the

6293.199 --> 6300.119
email Anonymous mail you had to send me

6297.28 --> 6305.08
Anonymous I couldn't actually like be a

6300.119 --> 6307.159
person behind that email how dare you oh

6305.08 --> 6309.88
here's the arguments from chat GPT

6307.159 --> 6313.0
bubble Horizon parallel to the plum line

6309.88 --> 6315.56
vertical reference adjustment practicing

6313.0 --> 6318.679
oh you got to practice that because you

6315.56 --> 6321.360000000001
need a stable platform at number six it

6318.679 --> 6322.96
actually says at the number six

6321.36 --> 6324.44
right this is should be around the Times

6322.96 --> 6327.4
like yeah

6324.44 --> 6330.96
but what about on a rocking

6327.4 --> 6332.839999999999
boat so you're going to do all this and

6330.96 --> 6334.32
then realize like oh yeah it doesn't

6332.84 --> 6336.639
really work that well right because

6334.32 --> 6341.44
we're not on a stable platform yeah yeah

6336.639 --> 6345.639
yeah unless of course you use the

6341.44 --> 6348.44
Horizon which will stay

6345.639 --> 6349.4800000000005
stable even if the boat you're standing

6348.44 --> 6351.4
on is

6349.48 --> 6354.159
rocking

6351.4 --> 6354.159
it's the most

6354.4 --> 6360.04
incompetent

6356.96 --> 6364.639
AI instruction on how to use a sexon

6360.04 --> 6364.639
ever it's literally there to make you

6365.0 --> 6372.639
lost so that you like if you literally

6368.92 --> 6375.639
you could have like two schools of us

6372.639 --> 6378.56
users of sex that you have the chat GPT

6375.639 --> 6378.56
and then you have 10th

6378.639 --> 6387.2390000000005
Man and then you're like have 10 people

6383.119 --> 6390.44
each the the 10th Man guys are going to

6387.239 --> 6394.119
find their ways to the destination the

6390.44 --> 6397.44
chat GPT guys are all going to die at

6394.119 --> 6397.44
sea all of

6409.4 --> 6412.4
it

6416.32 --> 6422.119
hopefully

6418.08 --> 6424.119
so yeah maybe look Kramers is just he

6422.119 --> 6426.759999999999
needs to just do it he says he does

6424.119 --> 6426.759999999999
Celestial

6427.56 --> 6434.639
navigation that's

6430.4 --> 6440.799999999999
cool so why don't you leave your mobile

6434.639 --> 6445.56
at home huh leave your mobile and your

6440.8 --> 6450.2390000000005
you know your GPS leave all of that at

6445.56 --> 6453.96
home take your Sextant with you you can

6450.239 --> 6458.959999999999
take a couple of maps paper maps yeah L

6453.96 --> 6462.44
Kramers and you go find your way in the

6458.96 --> 6466.32
ocean huh why don't you just try that

6462.44 --> 6468.04
out yeah just leave your mobile at home

6466.32 --> 6470.84
yeah no

6468.04 --> 6476.08
GPS to to correct you when when you [ __ ]

6470.84 --> 6479.28
it up no no no people survived on the

6476.08 --> 6483.32
Precision of their Celestial navigation

6479.28 --> 6486.679
even when the full Maps hadn't been

6483.32 --> 6489.08
correctly written down yet yeah and they

6486.679 --> 6491.28
still meant to go around with the

6489.08 --> 6494.92
accuracy that Celestial navigation

6491.28 --> 6499.239
provided them with

6494.92 --> 6501.679
yeah they did not follow the chat GPT

6499.239 --> 6504.239
instructions

6501.679 --> 6506.52
because if they would have if it had

6504.239 --> 6509.0
been there at the time if there was some

6506.52 --> 6510.84
idiot robot that appear to have some

6509.0 --> 6514.08
Authority intellectually and told them

6510.84 --> 6517.119000000001
to do it like that uh

6514.08 --> 6519.32
then there would be no United States

6517.119 --> 6519.32
right

6519.56 --> 6525.88
now it would just be like West India or

6527.56 --> 6533.159000000001
something or like

6531.159 --> 6536.839999999999
New

6533.159 --> 6536.839999999999
Denmark something like

6554.719 --> 6562.119
that you can't get over the Descent chat

6557.4 --> 6562.119
GP dude I I

6562.36 --> 6566.598999999999
I expect to be more

6566.84 --> 6574.84
shocked I expected to be more shocked

6571.28 --> 6578.5199999999995
by bumping into that he used chat

6574.84 --> 6582.52
GPT I will go into a rage now oh my God

6578.52 --> 6586.4400000000005
projecting much [ __ ] with your sock

6582.52 --> 6590.1990000000005
account oh my God I'm so enraged by

6586.44 --> 6592.44
this how dare you be an idiot that

6590.199 --> 6594.44
inquires with chat GPT on how to

6592.44 --> 6597.199
Celestial

6594.44 --> 6600.28
navigate yeah hey

6597.199 --> 6603.08
[ __ ] just go at Sea on on your little

6600.28 --> 6606.0
boat yeah no

6603.08 --> 6607.0
electronics maybe a little NightLight

6606.0 --> 6612.159
cuz it's

6607.0 --> 6615.239
scary yeah no mobile no

6612.159 --> 6620.719
GPS yeah and then use a

6615.239 --> 6625.5599999999995
sexon and Maps paper maps then navigate

6620.719 --> 6625.56
across the ocean yeah you do

6626.199 --> 6631.48
that you can print out chat GPT

6629.28 --> 6635.04
instructions if you want

6631.48 --> 6635.04
to before you

6639.4 --> 6646.0
go right and

6642.28 --> 6649.04
uh yeah I guess I'll hear

6646.0 --> 6651.159
about when the government decided that

6649.04 --> 6655.159
you were lost at se

7621.52 --> 7624.92

Richard

7624.92 --> 7631.76

7628.76 --> 7634.84
like their ability to

7631.76 --> 7637.52
like be socially successful and

7634.84 --> 7640.52
respectable that hurts

7637.52 --> 7640.52
them

7650.559 --> 7657.84
creator of Omie fans didn't yeah sure he

7654.28 --> 7657.84
didn't I'm sure

7659.4 --> 7666.0
duper not duper he might they might have

7663.0 --> 7669.639
said that whoever it is but I'm pretty

7666.0 --> 7671.48
damn sure it's exactly what they meant

7669.639 --> 7675.400000000001
that's exactly what they wanted they

7671.48 --> 7678.32
just wanted that Frontline tip of the

7675.4 --> 7682.96
spear the grossest thing that's going to

7678.32 --> 7686.32
be the biggest thing definitely

7682.96 --> 7690.28
that it's like oh how can we

7686.32 --> 7693.48
make like popular things

7690.28 --> 7695.199
porn social media how can we do

7693.48 --> 7697.44
something that's in between porn of

7695.199 --> 7700.44
social media there you go only

7697.44 --> 7700.44
fans

7701.52 --> 7707.84
I'm pretty damn sure he absolutely

7704.36 --> 7710.04
meant to turn out exactly what it is

7707.84 --> 7710.04
right

7726.76 --> 7731.639
now right I am kind of curious indeed

7729.36 --> 7733.119
Tom me like what did they say anyway I'm

7731.639 --> 7735.36
going to take a two-minute break I'll be

7733.119 --> 7735.36
right

7757.32 --> 7760.32
back

7846.44 --> 7853.799999999999
and I'm back wow man it's good

7849.159 --> 7853.799999999999
dark it is getting dark in

7866.32 --> 7872.4
here kind of like how M only videos are

7869.04 --> 7874.5199999999995
here on you yeah but dupons I mean

7872.4 --> 7877.28
there's a big difference though between

7874.52 --> 7880.0
members only here and only fans and that

7877.28 --> 7883.88
is that even members only it's very

7880.0 --> 7885.84
illegal to show explicit sexual

7883.88 --> 7890.28
content

7885.84 --> 7892.32
yeah uh they at only fans definitely

7890.28 --> 7896.92
just do allow

7892.32 --> 7900.36
that right so I don't see how they never

7896.92 --> 7902.599
intended it to be when they blatantly

7900.36 --> 7905.239
like allow that to happen when on

7902.599 --> 7907.2390000000005
YouTube yeah they don't so it's like oh

7905.239 --> 7910.839999999999
it meant to be like members only oh

7907.239 --> 7910.839999999999
really then why did did you allow

7911.4 --> 7918.48
porn cuz that's not allowed

7915.199 --> 7921.28
here so it seems a

7918.48 --> 7924.598999999999
bit bit

7921.28 --> 7924.599
hypocritical from

7927.48 --> 7933.598999999999
them yeah exactly didn't exactly clam

7930.28 --> 7933.599
down so then

7937.079 --> 7940.079
yeah

7986.52 --> 7991.639
fer Tik Tok uh I don't know either

7989.28 --> 7992.96
Richard G I don't follow Tik Tok I hear

7991.639 --> 7995.639
it's

7992.96 --> 7998.04
terrible and I don't follow only fans

7995.639 --> 7999.36
either but I mean only fans is like an

7998.04 --> 8003.559
attempt to

7999.36 --> 8006.679
like decentralize porn it's it really is

8003.559 --> 8009.2390000000005
just a the crossover between social

8006.679 --> 8009.2390000000005
media and

8009.96 --> 8016.159
porn I'd say only fans is more

8012.36 --> 8016.159
cringeworthy and it it's

8016.52 --> 8022.8
just it really surprises me that so much

8019.639 --> 8022.8
of this stuff is even

8026.96 --> 8029.96
legal

8041.96 --> 8047.119
when they banded people stop using it

8044.04 --> 8047.119
yeah duh

8052.599 --> 8058.599
duper oh that's the thing isn't it the

8055.199 --> 8060.04
overall this is a worrying trend away

8058.599 --> 8062.639
that's going to

8060.04 --> 8064.36
continue with all of humanity thanks to

8062.639 --> 8067.719
social media is that the overall

8064.36 --> 8070.88
interest in getting to know

8067.719 --> 8074.36
people as friends will go down and

8070.88 --> 8077.96
getting to use social media for quick

8074.36 --> 8080.239
cheap easy sex dates is going to go

8077.96 --> 8082.32
enormously up and it's going to be like

8080.239 --> 8084.5199999999995
a social

8082.32 --> 8086.36
derangement because people will stop

8084.52 --> 8089.88
being interested in other people other

8086.36 --> 8089.88
than to use them for sex

8090.639 --> 8093.28
it's going to get

8095.32 --> 8101.92
worse I like already sort of bumped into

8098.88 --> 8106.4400000000005
this thing being out there like even 10

8101.92 --> 8106.4400000000005
years ago and it shocked me to the

8108.04 --> 8115.8
core it's like when I'm want a girl I'm

8112.76 --> 8118.360000000001
really interested in Romance I want to

8115.8 --> 8121.88
see the feelings and the the expl ation

8118.36 --> 8123.558999999999
and the carefulness and this being

8121.88 --> 8125.159000000001
nervous

8123.559 --> 8129.2390000000005
and

8125.159 --> 8131.558999999999
like yeah see if it like really gets

8129.239 --> 8134.839999999999
close and then you're really attracted

8131.559 --> 8136.76
and then like eventually sex or

8134.84 --> 8139.719
something

8136.76 --> 8143.84
awesome I've got I'm lucky enough to

8139.719 --> 8147.559
have experienced that a couple of times

8143.84 --> 8149.4400000000005
some of which was AB really amazing like

8147.559 --> 8151.599
really

8149.44 --> 8154.799999999999
fulfilling

8151.599 --> 8158.04
but now it's just

8154.8 --> 8160.88
like the younger Generations don't

8158.04 --> 8164.92
understand it at

8160.88 --> 8167.4800000000005
all they don't like romance is becoming

8164.92 --> 8170.28
more and more

8167.48 --> 8173.36
alien like they don't get it

8170.28 --> 8176.119
anymore the nent they just don't

8173.36 --> 8176.119
understand the

8176.199 --> 8179.719
process it's creepy

8180.159 --> 8186.96
cuz to me this is a default

8183.76 --> 8190.559
necessity if I can't have

8186.96 --> 8195.359
romance along my sex then I won't have

8190.559 --> 8197.92
sex because that literally rubs me of

8195.359 --> 8201.04
energy I've had it like a couple of

8197.92 --> 8205.319
times where I sort of did that and it

8201.04 --> 8208.359
like robs me of my energy it's like not

8205.319 --> 8210.679
a good end result that's why I quit

8208.359 --> 8214.28
doing that and just like no definitely

8210.679 --> 8214.28
going to go for the romance

8236.599 --> 8240.639000000001
thing

8238.599 --> 8244.359
I talk about more subjects here than

8240.639 --> 8248.96
anyone else do I really Tommy are you

8244.359 --> 8250.880000000001
sure I mean I try to tackle as many

8248.96 --> 8255.119999999999
different subjects that I'm interested

8250.88 --> 8257.518999999998
in and can develop as I can possibly

8255.12 --> 8261.359
imagine but I'm sure there must be

8257.519 --> 8264.08
people that that talk even broader than

8261.359 --> 8267.92
me I mean maybe not as interesting but

8264.08 --> 8269.8
they would go there there's plenty of

8267.92 --> 8271.479
people that talk about esoterics there's

8269.8 --> 8273.0
plenty of people that talk about like

8271.479 --> 8276.24
Rudolph Steiner

8273.0 --> 8278.639
spirituality some of it actually good I

8276.24 --> 8281.119999999999
mean I like to think that whatever I tap

8278.639 --> 8283.88
dip my fingers into I'm going to then

8281.12 --> 8287.559000000001
relay that on a good level and not just

8283.88 --> 8290.679
a woozy generalized level I really do my

8287.559 --> 8293.599
best because I hate to be superficial

8290.679 --> 8296.519
about things I hate I

8293.599 --> 8302.12
like what do you call

8296.519 --> 8302.12
it like per default

8302.359 --> 8309.719000000001
like I hate superficiality in all

8306.319 --> 8311.84
forms including knowledge so it's like I

8309.719 --> 8315.358999999999
don't even want to talk about it unless

8311.84 --> 8315.359
I feel I understand

8315.479 --> 8323.719
more unless I can present something to a

8318.76 --> 8323.719000000001
degree that would satisfy my own

8326.519 --> 8329.519
curiosity

8329.559 --> 8335.88
right do give a good mixture I try but I

8333.12 --> 8338.0
mean I do end up mixing subjects that

8335.88 --> 8340.479
don't really mix too well Tommy that

8338.0 --> 8342.639
does happen right when I talk about like

8340.479 --> 8345.76
political

8342.639 --> 8348.839999999998
stuff very like it just becomes very

8345.76 --> 8352.84
different from when I talk

8348.84 --> 8354.679
about like mechanical stuff it's flat

8352.84 --> 8356.439
Earth or something like it's so

8354.679 --> 8361.28
different and it

8356.439 --> 8363.76
it it doesn't really fit together but I

8361.28 --> 8365.439
can like basically take the conversation

8363.76 --> 8368.2
in any of those

8365.439 --> 8370.92
directions I can do that I do have

8368.2 --> 8374.04
confidence about it and sometimes I do

8370.92 --> 8375.76
feel the need of it it's like yeah I

8374.04 --> 8377.359
mostly would love to talk about Flat

8375.76 --> 8380.679
Earth all the time and the mechanics and

8377.359 --> 8383.2
the bickering and all that [ __ ] but

8380.679 --> 8385.960000000001
sometimes I just do really feel the need

8383.2 --> 8389.439
like I really need to tell you about

8385.96 --> 8389.438999999998
this political thing right now

8390.359 --> 8395.12
but I definitely not bring up a

8392.56 --> 8396.8
political subject every single day

8395.12 --> 8399.52
because I know you'd all get kind of

8396.8 --> 8404.438999999998
tired of that and it doesn't really mix

8399.52 --> 8404.439
too well with the typical Flat Earth

8405.72 --> 8413.479
subject only Rising

8409.6 --> 8413.479000000001
Earths that's a good one

8413.76 --> 8419.359
slowmo oh my

8416.359 --> 8419.359
God

8422.6 --> 8426.720000000001
my God he he'd actually do that

8434.0 --> 8437.0
too

8441.68 --> 8448.720000000001
hilarious oh surprise surprise guys

8446.319 --> 8451.84
guess

8448.72 --> 8453.24
guess who didn't end up actually sending

8451.84 --> 8457.04
a

8453.24 --> 8459.16
manual over email guess right because it

8457.04 --> 8462.479000000001
might have taken some time but yeah

8459.16 --> 8465.119999999999
guess who didn't actually do that

8462.479 --> 8467.92
despite saying that they did and then

8465.12 --> 8470.560000000001
even repeating

8467.92 --> 8474.64
it guess who didn't

8470.56 --> 8474.64
send a manual to my

8474.88 --> 8482.16
email just wanted to re emphasize that

8479.0 --> 8486.04
yeah you got a jug

8482.16 --> 8488.399
exactly yeah hello by the way

8486.04 --> 8491.52
clammy welcome

8488.399 --> 8495.039999999999
back don't get too sticky on

8491.52 --> 8495.04
me and you'll be

8506.24 --> 8509.24
fine

8536.16 --> 8539.16
for

8560.399 --> 8568.0
and that's how you put two and two

8563.359 --> 8569.960000000001
together and get five no got four never

8568.0 --> 8572.439
watch D because I cannot understand him

8569.96 --> 8574.64
with that accent well it's not about the

8572.439 --> 8578.720000000001
accent it's just about him being very

8574.64 --> 8580.399
loud and just making a point in your

8578.72 --> 8583.399
face and then you don't even know what

8580.399 --> 8583.399
he's so excited

8585.04 --> 8589.439
about yeah and I mean I can't really

8587.56 --> 8592.279999999999
follow what he's talking about half the

8589.439 --> 8594.64
time not that I'd really want to anymore

8592.28 --> 8594.640000000001
at this

8596.08 --> 8602.6
point because he's just holding on to

8600.279 --> 8606.359
this ridiculous upward Rising Earth

8602.6 --> 8607.359
thing it's just so pathetic it is it is

8606.359 --> 8610.84
actually

8607.359 --> 8614.439
pathetic for him to do that to hold on

8610.84 --> 8614.439
he's just like

8617.52 --> 8625.720000000001
no I got my little niche I got the thing

8621.8 --> 8629.358999999999
that got everybody's head bent I found

8625.72 --> 8632.88
the thing the Earth is rising upwards

8629.359 --> 8635.319
I'm not going to listen to your

8632.88 --> 8639.72
counterargumentation cuz I made it work

8635.319 --> 8639.72
in my head and now it must be

8639.84 --> 8646.960000000001
real look at me presuppose the Earth is

8643.479 --> 8650.438999999998
rising up with everything I try to do to

8646.96 --> 8653.358999999999
demonstrate that the Earth is rising up

8650.439 --> 8654.279
oh look at me think I'm unsmart I found

8653.359 --> 8657.640000000001
my

8654.279 --> 8660.399000000001
Niche oh look at everybody reject it

8657.64 --> 8662.08
with plain arguments and logic and

8660.399 --> 8664.399
pointing out that I'm presupposing the

8662.08 --> 8666.039999999999
Earth is rising up and then me getting

8664.399 --> 8666.96
all confused like a baller and not

8666.04 --> 8671.279
getting it

8666.96 --> 8674.519999999999
anymore bickering bicker bicker yeah

8671.279 --> 8677.279
yeah no it's freaking waste of time man

8674.52 --> 8679.359
like listening to Dell three years ago

8677.279 --> 8681.6
would have been pretty interesting and

8679.359 --> 8683.76
amusing

8681.6 --> 8688.960000000001
now

8683.76 --> 8688.960000000001
please what a waste of time

8689.439 --> 8695.08
is Jim Bob a flat

8691.2 --> 8698.2
earther not overtly Richard G is not

8695.08 --> 8700.64
like talking about it all the time but

8698.2 --> 8702.16
he did get into flatter even into

8700.64 --> 8705.358999999999
flatter Earth of the bait for a bit

8702.16 --> 8707.76
before Owen Benjamin clash and it seemed

8705.359 --> 8711.04
like he did recognize that the Earth is

8707.76 --> 8713.279
flat he didn't seem to be like a

8711.04 --> 8715.359
baller but he's not like a guy that

8713.279 --> 8718.960000000001
loves to talk about

8715.359 --> 8722.399000000001
it and to be Fair we don't really love

8718.96 --> 8722.399
him to talk about it at this

8729.76 --> 8734.880000000001
point I mean it's just I don't

8738.16 --> 8746.68
yeah you love asking Scottish people to

8741.88 --> 8749.24
say Burger alarm yeah [ __ ] you I can't

8746.68 --> 8754.12
even do that with a Scottish

8749.24 --> 8754.119999999999
accent damn it that's barely

8754.56 --> 8761.16
Scottish just saying purple burglar

8757.399 --> 8761.16
alarm is already kind of

8763.279 --> 8770.76
challenging like you have to make

8766.64 --> 8770.76
articulation effort to say that

8772.64 --> 8780.24
correctly works with Irish also

8777.319 --> 8783.56
didn't use the ra yeah whatever duper

8780.24 --> 8783.56
but ra is like

8785.319 --> 8792.519999999999
whatever R RI is more like a a person

8789.88 --> 8794.56
that just really likes attention and

8792.52 --> 8797.479000000001
that happens to dwell among flat

8794.56 --> 8797.479
earthers and all

8798.0 --> 8803.6
that I don't know really where she

8800.24 --> 8805.08
stands I don't really care like more the

8803.6 --> 8807.800000000001
more time passes the more it just seems

8805.08 --> 8810.56
a r is just a complete waste of time

8807.8 --> 8811.479
time her videos don't have real points

8810.56 --> 8816.08
that are

8811.479 --> 8816.08
interesting it's just weird

8816.399 --> 8820.319
awkward just got back are we in for

8819.0 --> 8825.64
another

8820.319 --> 8825.64
four uh no no not that

8828.12 --> 8834.12
much no it's not going to be a 4our show

8830.76 --> 8834.12
like yesterday sorry

8835.72 --> 8838.72
guys

8843.96 --> 8851.519999999999
what's with the only

8845.68 --> 8851.52
plump wow you missed all of that DED

8859.439 --> 8865.2
really I should probably put that in the

8862.2 --> 8869.04
title other than only trolls only trolls

8865.2 --> 8869.04
is not good idea to in

8895.64 --> 8898.64
there

8925.6 --> 8928.6
for

8948.84 --> 8954.16
let's yeah what do you think of this

8950.92 --> 8957.2
title on the ocean SL navigation needs

8954.16 --> 8960.24
the Horizon vs chat GP

8957.2 --> 8960.240000000002
# only

8962.68 --> 8969.64
plum only trolls was a fun idea but

8965.92 --> 8972.6
that's like did not that did not result

8969.64 --> 8972.599999999999
in what I thought it

8977.92 --> 8982.399
would just refresh to get the new

8983.72 --> 8989.599999999999
title let's click only Plum and see what

8986.64 --> 8992.358999999999
YouTube actually nope nothing to see

8989.6 --> 8994.6
here oh they actually use a telescope

8992.359 --> 8994.6
that's

8995.439 --> 9005.64
hilarious try searching only

8999.439 --> 9005.64
Plum okay Plumbing now it's all

9008.279 --> 9012.560000000001
Plumbing anyway it's better like this

9010.68 --> 9013.279
that it doesn't actually yield a bunch

9012.56 --> 9016.0
of

9013.279 --> 9022.24
websites or YouTube pages that are

9016.0 --> 9022.24
literally about troll laring or whatever

9045.439 --> 9048.439
h

9052.12 --> 9054.800000000001
oh only

9057.0 --> 9060.0
fed

9065.68 --> 9074.68
okay only fat it sounds weird though

9070.88 --> 9074.679999999998
only fee

9075.359 --> 9081.359
okay that's never G I'm never going to

9077.84 --> 9086.8
get used to that though fee because fee

9081.359 --> 9086.800000000001
very silly wise always reminds me of

9089.8 --> 9094.08
like of like those guys from

9094.88 --> 9100.8
bottom what is it again that crazy ass

9098.2 --> 9104.880000000001
movie they made together where they just

9100.8 --> 9106.88
like yell through a hole through a

9104.88 --> 9114.479
hole Fe

9106.88 --> 9116.56
fee one boiled egg fee what fee one it's

9114.479 --> 9119.358999999999
completely stupid but I mean they

9116.56 --> 9123.08
literally say fee and it's so weird

9119.359 --> 9124.6
because this Flat Earth early bird

9123.08 --> 9126.92
reminds me of

9124.6 --> 9130.16
that sometimes I want to like take a

9126.92 --> 9134.04
clip of them saying that as part of the

9130.16 --> 9136.8
intro but it would be really

9134.04 --> 9140.800000000001
silly I mean it's like right after this

9136.8 --> 9143.96
scene where literally the one guy slings

9140.8 --> 9146.8
the other guy around him using meat

9143.96 --> 9148.08
Hawks in their nose okay it's that kind

9146.8 --> 9151.199999999999
of a

9148.08 --> 9152.479
movie it's the most ridiculous movie

9151.2 --> 9155.479000000001
ever to be

9152.479 --> 9155.479
exact

9165.24 --> 9168.24
h

9170.2 --> 9173.279
yeah only win

9174.04 --> 9180.6
no I just stop with the only [ __ ] I

9178.359 --> 9182.16
don't want anything with an only in

9180.6 --> 9187.319
front of

9182.16 --> 9187.319
it that is actually tied in with me

9195.16 --> 9201.039999999999
thanks maybe it was like only prud or

9198.88 --> 9203.319
something that would be hilarious like

9201.04 --> 9206.2
what are you going to do with that huh

9203.319 --> 9207.91
are you going to sexualite Hash

9206.2 --> 9210.640000000001
only

9207.91 --> 9214.279
[Music]

9210.64 --> 9216.439
prudes oh wait that's not a

9214.279 --> 9219.0
hashtag oh

9216.439 --> 9220.92
great yeah YouTube is one of those moods

9219.0 --> 9223.399
where you can't remove your own messages

9220.92 --> 9228.16
unless you refresh the page because it

9223.399 --> 9228.16
makes no [ __ ] sense that it does that

9232.24 --> 9236.039999999999
[ __ ] sake come on there you

9237.72 --> 9244.119999999999
go I am nearing the 3K sub yeah that's

9241.72 --> 9246.64
good luck with that teret I've been

9244.12 --> 9249.640000000001
balancing on the same amount of sub now

9246.64 --> 9254.72
for literally a

9249.64 --> 9258.08
year I've not gotten any subs this year

9254.72 --> 9258.08
at all

9261.72 --> 9267.199999999999
right I'm where am I

9264.2 --> 9267.2
now

9267.6 --> 9274.52
2769 you know where I was last

9272.479 --> 9278.479
January

9274.52 --> 9278.479000000001
2023 yeah

9279.68 --> 9285.04
2769 but I got 20 subscribers in the

9282.439 --> 9287.16
last 28 days even though it's exactly

9285.04 --> 9289.560000000001
the same number and it keeps staying

9287.16 --> 9293.84
that exact same number the entire

9289.56 --> 9293.84
[ __ ] year no matter what

9296.399 --> 9302.278999999999
happened

9298.479 --> 9304.199999999999
so yeah supposedly nearing Subs whatever

9302.279 --> 9308.04
man it's completely

9304.2 --> 9311.560000000001
rigged my sub count is completely rigged

9308.04 --> 9311.560000000001
it does not represent an

9312.72 --> 9318.0
actual linear UNM meddled with a

9325.0 --> 9330.64
out right maybe there's a lot of people

9327.439 --> 9332.84
subbing well they then get Auto

9330.64 --> 9334.72
unsubscribe probably I don't know

9332.84 --> 9337.04
exactly how it's happening but I'm not

9334.72 --> 9338.76
growing my channel is not growing

9337.04 --> 9341.160000000002
despite me making lots of effort

9338.76 --> 9342.92
connecting up with new people putting

9341.16 --> 9346.6
myself out there a

9342.92 --> 9348.6
lot drawing in attention in ways

9346.6 --> 9351.12
doesn't matter I don't get more

9348.6 --> 9351.960000000001
subscribers if you try to subscribe

9351.12 --> 9354.279
that's

9351.96 --> 9356.0
cool there's a good chance that you'll

9354.279 --> 9358.12
just be unsubscribed and then either

9356.0 --> 9361.52
forget about

9358.12 --> 9363.92
me or you keep trying to resubscribe and

9361.52 --> 9365.84
find that you have to resubscribe every

9363.92 --> 9367.68
half a year because you just get Auto

9365.84 --> 9370.04
unsubscribed that's been happening for a

9367.68 --> 9371.800000000001
while to certain people a lot of them

9370.04 --> 9373.76
kind of give it up they're just like

9371.8 --> 9377.519999999999
Okay YouTube just doesn't allow me to be

9373.76 --> 9380.0
subscribed to this guy I'll just give

9377.52 --> 9383.479000000001
up that's what they're counting on

9380.0 --> 9386.279
that's how they win like they

9383.479 --> 9389.88
decide what you [ __ ] do with your

9386.279 --> 9395.279
online life they decide what you do not

9389.88 --> 9399.039999999999
you they'll just tell you how it is just

9395.279 --> 9401.6
like punish you for liking the wrong

9399.04 --> 9404.880000000001
things they'll punish you they'll get in

9401.6 --> 9407.720000000001
your way they'll just meddle with your

9404.88 --> 9411.839999999998
system unsubscribe

9407.72 --> 9415.679999999998
you always turn the notifications

9411.84 --> 9418.880000000001
off or have them

9415.68 --> 9421.24
late or you get a lot of lag for no

9418.88 --> 9423.88
apparent reason whatever they do they

9421.24 --> 9426.68
just don't want my channel to be bigger

9423.88 --> 9429.039999999999
pretty much no matter the cost it's like

9426.68 --> 9432.52
I'm some

9429.04 --> 9435.279
secret political opponent Overlord that

9432.52 --> 9438.0
nobody knows about it's like and if if I

9435.279 --> 9440.08
get the numbers oh my God the world's

9438.0 --> 9443.56
going to go down

9440.08 --> 9445.439
then oh I'm going to so going to go down

9443.56 --> 9447.64
cuz they're just terrified that what if

9445.439 --> 9451.08
H what happens if Arwin suddenly gets

9447.64 --> 9453.76
like Fame and money like will he

9451.08 --> 9456.56
actually start to make work of hunting

9453.76 --> 9459.92
down and executing

9456.56 --> 9462.96
satanists and reintroducing the death

9459.92 --> 9466.24
penalty specifically for that

9462.96 --> 9469.88
end will he go full eugenics on the

9466.24 --> 9472.72
Satanist yeah yeah I probably

9469.88 --> 9475.479
will and I'll probably have that hanging

9472.72 --> 9479.08
around with me till I

9475.479 --> 9481.399
die so it could result in two things

9479.08 --> 9482.24
right at my at the end of my life either

9481.399 --> 9485.72
it's

9482.24 --> 9490.319
like well at least I stay the good

9485.72 --> 9494.479
guy or thank God all that shit's finally

9490.319 --> 9497.0
over they're all dead like all of them

9494.479 --> 9499.88
all those [ __ ] comebacks that I

9497.0 --> 9503.16
literally got born in

9499.88 --> 9505.88
between in my lifetime who ruin

9503.16 --> 9508.0
everything from the start I just learn

9505.88 --> 9512.438999999998
how much they ruin

9508.0 --> 9516.319
everything finally they're all dead and

9512.439 --> 9518.52
like everything about them is dead and

9516.319 --> 9520.399
their families are that are left are

9518.52 --> 9523.76
definitely not going to pursue the same

9520.399 --> 9523.76
thing or they will be dead

9524.72 --> 9531.599999999999
too

9527.64 --> 9531.599999999999
and then I can finally move on with my

9532.12 --> 9537.240000000002
life into whatever into the unknown

9535.319 --> 9539.56
because it's like yeah this my entire

9537.24 --> 9542.439
life's been about this [ __ ] one way or

9539.56 --> 9546.199999999999
the other it's been completely about

9542.439 --> 9550.279
this my entire life is like a response

9546.2 --> 9553.359
to the world to how it

9550.279 --> 9558.16
is and trying to defend against it it's

9553.359 --> 9560.68
my entire life and all I really want is

9558.16 --> 9564.52
for those people that have done that to

9560.68 --> 9564.52
all die horrendous

9565.479 --> 9571.599999999999
deaths and that's going to be thousands

9568.52 --> 9571.6
and thousands of

9573.439 --> 9580.92
people it's not just the freaking Co

9577.56 --> 9583.88
[ __ ] there a lot of

9580.92 --> 9586.92
things a lot of

9583.88 --> 9589.96
things like

9586.92 --> 9592.319
the judicial system needs some serious

9589.96 --> 9596.278999999999
combing the banking system needs

9592.319 --> 9599.24
potential complete shutdown and in oh

9596.279 --> 9603.68
