um

123.36 --> 128.58
right I didn't do anything I didn't

126.24 --> 129.84
change anything so that just seemed to

128.58 --> 131.54000000000002
have happened

129.84 --> 135.02
I just noticed

131.54 --> 137.7
anyway the weather today is different

135.02 --> 141.3
it's a lot more cloudy but there's still

137.7 --> 143.39999999999998
some nice blue spots in between there

141.3 --> 147.20000000000002
a little bit of sun earlier but now

143.4 --> 147.20000000000002
clouds are in front of it

153.48 --> 157.64
it's really remarkably wind still

175.379 --> 178.04
uh

179.94 --> 186.239
right

182.64 --> 189.23899999999998
hello slo-mo moon buggy first in chat

186.239 --> 196.62
Mike zudunich

189.239 --> 196.62
it is Tuesday the 23rd of November 2021.

197.099 --> 200.78
I got some sad news

201.84 --> 206.459
Tony first bit Yeah sleeping worse

205.019 --> 209.09900000000002
started bringing it up

206.459 --> 211.94
yesterday night and I thought it's just

209.099 --> 211.94
another rumor

212.879 --> 217.379
apparently Adam

214.64 --> 222.35999999999999
confirmed it

217.379 --> 225.35999999999999
to him and that is that Antonio subarats

222.36 --> 228.739
the old fairy wizard

225.36 --> 228.739
seems to have passed away

232.56 --> 235.159
yeah

235.5 --> 241.62
now

237.299 --> 243.54000000000002
if you've only known my show and flatter

241.62 --> 246.72
debates if you've only been on the scene

243.54 --> 249.239
for like the last three years

246.72 --> 251.819
that yeah you probably never heard of

249.239 --> 254.09900000000002
him or like he's some troll but

251.819 --> 256.81899999999996
yeah he was actually like part of the

254.099 --> 256.819
first wave

256.859 --> 262.079
and I was a big fan of him at the time

259.979 --> 264.62
it's a very curious fellow but yeah

262.079 --> 264.62
apparently

265.32 --> 271.04
he has succumbed to something it's not

267.66 --> 271.04
really clear like what

272.4 --> 277.56
now of course he had

274.22 --> 280.28000000000003
pretty severe health issues cancer first

277.56 --> 280.28000000000003
and foremost

280.68 --> 286.34000000000003
so yeah maybe

282.54 --> 286.34000000000003
something happened concerning that

286.74 --> 290.06
we were talking about it just got here

288.54 --> 294.5
hello catch you inspect yeah Antonio

290.06 --> 294.5
subarets you might not have heard of him

295.259 --> 299.36
but he's like a first wave flat earther

313.62 --> 318.66
right so yeah this this literally just

316.5 --> 319.5
came rolling into my lap

318.66 --> 321.84000000000003
foreign

319.5 --> 325.46
like right as I was gonna start the show

321.84 --> 325.46
so I'm a little flustered about it

327.18 --> 330.90000000000003
like

328.919 --> 333.32
I had a lot of communications with him

330.9 --> 333.32
back then

334.86 --> 339.539
it was a very talented guy but yeah

337.56 --> 343.88
plagued by his ego

339.539 --> 343.88
that's that yeah it's very typical

344.039 --> 348.59999999999997
and I see him as somebody who's made a

346.32 --> 351.419
couple of really bad decisions and

348.6 --> 354.24
then runs away from that forever

351.419 --> 357.38
and that's kind of like that was what

354.24 --> 357.38
was going on with him

359.4 --> 365.4
yes exactly old horse Redbone

362.819 --> 367.91900000000004
yeah it was that's why I say he was part

365.4 --> 370.919
of the first wave

367.919 --> 370.919
2015.

374.16 --> 378.6
and he had a interesting detailed way

377.039 --> 381.71999999999997
with words

378.6 --> 383.88
and was creative with it

381.72 --> 385.97900000000004
especially when he he really felt

383.88 --> 388.68
comfortable and was kind of free because

385.979 --> 390.539
later he just he got involved in the

388.68 --> 392.1
infighting and that turned him into a

390.539 --> 394.58
complete savanye

392.1 --> 397.68
and after that point he'd never really

394.58 --> 400.4
reverted back to the old format

397.68 --> 400.40000000000003
I think

401.759 --> 407.06
which is very tragic

404.16 --> 407.06
but yeah this

407.58 --> 411.139
this is kind of shocking to me

415.259 --> 418.16
type his name

430.259 --> 434.759
right

432.419 --> 436.74
so back in the day did his show us

434.759 --> 440.699
typically how you recognize him you kind

436.74 --> 442.56
of like me as like a white back wall but

440.699 --> 444.0
he would then have like this specific

442.56 --> 446.4
map

444.0 --> 449.819
with a big red circle and he would

446.4 --> 452.21999999999997
always very unspokenly position his head

449.819 --> 454.8
to be like right in front of the red

452.22 --> 456.96000000000004
circle like he had a halo around his

454.8 --> 460.52000000000004
head

456.96 --> 460.52
I always thought it was hilarious

461.34 --> 466.13899999999995
because that's kind of sort of the

463.08 --> 468.479
sneaky thing that I would like to do

466.139 --> 471.199
when I was like in a giddy mood but

468.479 --> 471.199
anyway yeah

471.78 --> 475.15999999999997
that's how I remember him

479.699 --> 487.8
and he was together in on a very big

483.539 --> 489.36
like the first real worldwide project

487.8 --> 491.099
with

489.36 --> 493.8
Nathan Oakley

491.099 --> 495.96
in uh what is it this

493.8 --> 499.44
it was the big sun project I don't

495.96 --> 502.56
remember the name uh

499.44 --> 505.02
but like literally they contacted

502.56 --> 507.539
everybody

505.02 --> 511.139
they knew around the world

507.539 --> 513.7189999999999
and said like okay so like keep track of

511.139 --> 516.839
the sun with your camera and like it was

513.719 --> 520.74
a giant live stream with like hundreds

516.839 --> 525.0
of people all over the world

520.74 --> 527.82
and they were all like observing the Sun

525.0 --> 530.94
like just to try to figure out like

527.82 --> 532.2600000000001
where's the sun where is its angle in

530.94 --> 534.72
relation to that person's position

532.26 --> 538.4399999999999
position and then tried to coordinate it

534.72 --> 540.72
with the map that they had it was really

538.44 --> 543.48
interesting and kind of

540.72 --> 546.36
yeah it revealed some weird situations

543.48 --> 548.339
where it seemed like the map was

546.36 --> 551.94
actually twisted or something because

548.339 --> 553.8000000000001
the sun orientations didn't really seem

551.94 --> 557.1600000000001
logical

553.8 --> 558.7199999999999
to me it was like a big

557.16 --> 560.76
flag

558.72 --> 562.74
like yeah

560.76 --> 567.06
uh maybe they're not in the position

562.74 --> 569.64
they seem to should seemingly should be

567.06 --> 571.0799999999999
because of their holographic nature that

569.64 --> 574.56
just

571.08 --> 575.519
doesn't work like that was maybe the

574.56 --> 578.9399999999999
first

575.519 --> 582.42
sign to me of that

578.94 --> 586.6800000000001
or rather the first confirmation

582.42 --> 589.399
right oh subi rats yeah sorry

586.68 --> 589.399
yeah you're right

600.779 --> 603.8
how old was he

604.2 --> 609.62
uh it's early in his 40s like me

634.32 --> 639.48
yeah any

637.56 --> 640.8599999999999
he also

639.48 --> 643.6800000000001
left

640.86 --> 645.6
yeah I mean knowing this if he died yeah

643.68 --> 648.9799999999999
he left two daughters

645.6 --> 648.98
like in their teens

673.92 --> 678.7199999999999
look guys I'm not saying that I'm

675.899 --> 682.26
emotional but it's just like

678.72 --> 683.519
is this to me like this is energy

682.26 --> 687.12
stuff

683.519 --> 691.079
he was strong in his own way

687.12 --> 694.26
he really put things he set a standard

691.079 --> 698.64
for a lot of people with his entry

694.26 --> 701.459
at the first wave he's in his own right

698.64 --> 704.04
he to me he set the bar

701.459 --> 706.14
like and he he was a guy that also like

704.04 --> 708.3
said yeah like I'm a wizard

706.14 --> 710.579
right

708.3 --> 714.74
you could almost say that I've maybe

710.579 --> 714.7399999999999
even like copied that from him

714.779 --> 721.98
but not really because well yeah the act

718.26 --> 724.26
of declaring that maybe but

721.98 --> 726.4200000000001
yeah I have a lot more to reflect upon

724.26 --> 727.98
it like my whole d d book and all that

726.42 --> 730.5
that I wrote

727.98 --> 734.36
I'm a game mastering but I think that he

730.5 --> 734.36
always also was kind of into that

737.04 --> 739.88
ah

750.54 --> 753.38
yeah man

756.42 --> 759.899
oh

757.32 --> 764.0600000000001
I didn't call it guys I did say this

759.899 --> 764.06
ancestral wins was going to be a big one

765.42 --> 769.04
I just didn't really expect

772.079 --> 778.4399999999999
uh like well to me maybe I just took it

776.88 --> 780.12
a little naively and positive and just

778.44 --> 781.8000000000001
thought like everybody's gonna get their

780.12 --> 783.839
moments of being upset you're not going

781.8 --> 785.88
to be able to be go through it like

783.839 --> 787.5600000000001
nothing's changing everybody's going to

785.88 --> 789.72
be effective we're seeing this all over

787.56 --> 792.42
the place like seriously the whole

789.72 --> 794.1600000000001
social chemistry now at the Flat Earth

792.42 --> 796.92
debates is a mess

794.16 --> 798.899
because everybody is like it's way too

796.92 --> 801.74
much energy and they don't realize that

798.899 --> 801.74
they're acting different

802.139 --> 806.1
the usual

803.88 --> 808.4399999999999
level Compass of energy level

806.1 --> 811.2
measurement doesn't work as well now

808.44 --> 813.839
because of the ancestral wins when

811.2 --> 815.82
you're a really mentally High active

813.839 --> 818.519
person

815.82 --> 820.9200000000001
get confused and you get caught up and

818.519 --> 822.42
start to act like a leprechaun it's not

820.92 --> 824.9399999999999
a joke

822.42 --> 827.18
well it is a joke but it's also kind of

824.94 --> 827.1800000000001
true

828.199 --> 832.26
but I didn't expect like that so many

831.12 --> 834.0600000000001
people

832.26 --> 836.699
that I kind of know

834.06 --> 840.8
through the internet would just die like

836.699 --> 840.8
that in such a short period of time

853.68 --> 860.3599999999999
we are between lunar and solar eclipses

856.32 --> 860.36
right oh really okay

867.899 --> 872.6
all right also I wanted to make a little

870.36 --> 872.6
note

875.399 --> 880.86
I think that like I was watching Owen

879.06 --> 883.6199999999999
Benjamin from yesterday the first part

880.86 --> 885.9590000000001
and like I was like whoa dude he's like

883.62 --> 888.5
saying exactly what I was saying but I

885.959 --> 888.5
was first

889.139 --> 893.1
it was hilarious

891.72 --> 896.1
like about

893.1 --> 898.0790000000001
well he he he did a lot more research he

896.1 --> 900.48
is more research he has better sources

898.079 --> 904.68
more details

900.48 --> 908.899
he is a professional bod you know

904.68 --> 908.899
but like about the cow Written House

908.94 --> 912.74
and like match the BLM

913.92 --> 919.199
so yeah I I knew I was calling it but I

917.76 --> 922.139
call it

919.199 --> 924.0
doesn't mean anything he never I'm

922.139 --> 926.22
pretty sure he didn't get it from

924.0 --> 929.1
watching my stream it's just realizing

926.22 --> 930.839
like the time moment without the contact

929.1 --> 932.5790000000001
and then

930.839 --> 934.32
like how

932.579 --> 937.079
how much

934.32 --> 939.9590000000001
how structurally the same

937.079 --> 943.92
I like that's like synchronicity from

939.959 --> 947.279
like natural spring building

943.92 --> 951.3
and I love it and I I didn't it makes me

947.279 --> 953.399
feel very close to own Benjamin

951.3 --> 956.279
oh that sounds kind of you know what but

953.399 --> 958.32
I'm not gonna say that but

956.279 --> 961.279
because yeah

958.32 --> 961.279
I appreciate

963.36 --> 970.019
like his energy his frequency

967.38 --> 972.48
also yeah his way of dealing with that

970.019 --> 975.6
and being kind of hard

972.48 --> 977.399
and also making it really about social

975.6 --> 981.839
dominance but

977.399 --> 986.699
subtle and not use it to distract a way

981.839 --> 989.82
into ego issues right it's very yeah

986.699 --> 991.92
it's complicated life managing of social

989.82 --> 993.1800000000001
skills and he's so great at it and I

991.92 --> 995.519
just

993.18 --> 998.06
I find him very inspiring and hilarious

995.519 --> 998.0600000000001
at times

1001.94 --> 1004.5400000000001
anyway

1008.5 --> 1016.779
you've self-de-indeed well yourself

1012.86 --> 1016.779

1039.02 --> 1041.98
get out of here

1053.299 --> 1057.58

1111.74 --> 1115.82
the kangaroos well I didn't see it live

1113.78 --> 1119.66
but I scrolled back and I did see yeah

1115.82 --> 1122.3799999999999
that was a whole whole family of him

1119.66 --> 1122.38
hilarious

1139.58 --> 1144.1999999999998
all right and the and like from what I

1142.58 --> 1148.24
could see they looked very healthy too

1144.2 --> 1148.24
very fairy skin

1162.32 --> 1167.6789999999999
or Pelt I think it is

1164.9 --> 1167.679
not sure

1169.64 --> 1173.6200000000001
yeah

1170.72 --> 1173.6200000000001
foreign

1186.52 --> 1190.299
into the kangaroos

1191.299 --> 1194.08
yeah maybe

1195.2 --> 1198.46
does he have a drone

1199.82 --> 1203.62
I'm not sure he might he might

1205.28 --> 1209.74
although yeah

1207.5 --> 1212.12
but yeah I could do that sometime just

1209.74 --> 1215.179
like oh there's a bunch of animals then

1212.12 --> 1218.36
fly the Drone right in between them

1215.179 --> 1220.7
make all sketch about it even like

1218.36 --> 1222.86
use your drone to then face an animal

1220.7 --> 1225.32
get its attention so it's gonna look up

1222.86 --> 1227.799
and then basically start to ask a flat

1225.32 --> 1227.799
Earth questions

1228.919 --> 1232.539
I think that would make a great skit

1238.69 --> 1241.799
[Music]

1250.64 --> 1252.88
foreign

1254.72 --> 1257.72
clutch

1263.419 --> 1269.6000000000001
a clutch you were there right yesterday

1266.72 --> 1274.419
on my show

1269.6 --> 1274.4189999999999
you did see it right also the start

1279.98 --> 1284.6200000000001
right so did you see Owen Benjamin

1282.38 --> 1284.6200000000001
yesterday

1294.32 --> 1298.36
so I totally called it didn't I

1300.98 --> 1306.74
like it really stood out to me like wow

1303.62 --> 1310.299
he's just saying the same as what I was

1306.74 --> 1310.299
saying except more detail

1311.539 --> 1315.3799999999999
like was really remarkable and I'm

1313.58 --> 1318.62
pretty sure that he hasn't like seen my

1315.38 --> 1323.14
show or anything it's just like wow

1318.62 --> 1323.1399999999999
it felt kind of Epic to me

1336.62 --> 1339.2199999999998
huh

1339.919 --> 1344.26
oh he did having her own one one time

1346.22 --> 1351.919
all right yeah I I skipped that part I

1350.6 --> 1354.08
didn't see it

1351.919 --> 1357.3200000000002
it was like on a phone call with my

1354.08 --> 1359.96
friend from Nightmare who's been very

1357.32 --> 1361.52
College recently going through some

1359.96 --> 1363.6200000000001
things

1361.52 --> 1367.0
going through the ancestor wins in her

1363.62 --> 1367.0
own ride and it's quite a challenge

1377.0 --> 1381.919
but yeah she also typically calls around

1379.46 --> 1384.559
that time

1381.919 --> 1387.0200000000002
so yeah I don't know for some reason

1384.559 --> 1389.6589999999999
because I get a lot of distractions to

1387.02 --> 1391.039
not see a Mitchell from Australia's life

1389.659 --> 1393.7600000000002
for some reason

1391.039 --> 1393.76
uh

1395.419 --> 1399.5800000000002
right but yeah you could use the Drone

1397.22 --> 1399.58
for that

1400.34 --> 1403.82
I don't know maybe maybe he likes my

1402.2 --> 1407.0
idea

1403.82 --> 1409.28
it would be very fun loving just like

1407.0 --> 1411.62
getting using the Drone to get up close

1409.28 --> 1414.02
to animals not too close but enough to

1411.62 --> 1416.8999999999999
get their attention

1414.02 --> 1418.46
and and just during life you just talk

1416.9 --> 1420.3200000000002
to them like they're not literally gonna

1418.46 --> 1422.6000000000001
hear it

1420.32 --> 1424.3999999999999
but like imagining like you're asking

1422.6 --> 1426.559
them like Flat Earth questions and about

1424.4 --> 1430.22
the Earth and then

1426.559 --> 1432.86
just taking their mellow looks or

1430.22 --> 1436.159
disinterest and interpret it

1432.86 --> 1438.1399999999999
as a response that's just funny

1436.159 --> 1440.9
right

1438.14 --> 1443.96
that's like harmless fun

1440.9 --> 1446.5
it will be totally down Mitchell's Lane

1443.96 --> 1446.5
anyway

1474.98 --> 1480.2
too much buzzing sound from the Drone

1478.279 --> 1484.179
uh

1480.2 --> 1484.179
oh it's not a very silent run

1488.84 --> 1494.24
is it a big one or because the small

1491.24 --> 1497.08
ones like barely they more sound like

1494.24 --> 1497.08
big gnats

1497.09 --> 1500.539
[Music]

1498.5 --> 1502.64
but you don't even have to get up that

1500.539 --> 1504.799
close if yeah

1502.64 --> 1507.38
just just enough for them to kind of

1504.799 --> 1509.36
like start to look up

1507.38 --> 1513.74
could be like

1509.36 --> 1516.08
at three five meters distance

1513.74 --> 1518.6
right as long as there's just there in

1516.08 --> 1521.98
the shot and they pick up on it

1518.6 --> 1521.98
uh anyway

1522.32 --> 1527.74
it made a lot of noise okay yeah that's

1525.26 --> 1527.74
too bad

1547.4 --> 1556.96
you think you guys think the sun is

1550.7 --> 1556.96
inside or outside of firmament okay well

1557.6 --> 1560.9189999999999
what is the firmament

1560.96 --> 1566.9
and

1563.539 --> 1570.14
why do you assume it is inside or

1566.9 --> 1572.779
outside why do you assume

1570.14 --> 1574.96
a position why do you assume what is the

1572.779 --> 1574.96
Sun

1586.94 --> 1594.5800000000002
like is it anywhere or is it just

1591.26 --> 1594.58
as side effects

1599.96 --> 1605.44
don't know but it's not 93 million miles

1603.14 --> 1605.44
away

1605.48 --> 1610.159
well I don't think it's at any distance

1607.4 --> 1613.94
it's only at an apparent distance

1610.159 --> 1618.38
because it's a holographic-like effect

1613.94 --> 1620.9
and yeah like a rainbow which is very

1618.38 --> 1623.6000000000001
yeah

1620.9 --> 1625.3400000000001
the rainbows come from the Sun it

1623.6 --> 1627.6399999999999
Rainbows are the way they are because of

1625.34 --> 1627.6399999999999
the Sun

1628.159 --> 1635.38
so it's like a derivative and it is much

1630.799 --> 1635.3799999999999
more noticeably holographic in nature

1652.039 --> 1657.7
what Nitro flat water that doesn't make

1655.279 --> 1657.7
any sense

1658.159 --> 1664.5800000000002
but heat comes from no it doesn't

1661.159 --> 1667.22
it doesn't come from anything

1664.58 --> 1669.5
the light

1667.22 --> 1672.2
is interacting with the material and

1669.5 --> 1676.539
that's where the heat arrives

1672.2 --> 1676.539
it doesn't come from anywhere

1677.72 --> 1682.48
it manifests it's holographic

1694.7 --> 1699.2
it gives off he oh really did you

1697.399 --> 1701.9599999999998
measure that

1699.2 --> 1704.0
how does it give off heat like a

1701.96 --> 1706.64
radiator right because with the radiator

1704.0 --> 1708.919
yeah it gives off heat and then you move

1706.64 --> 1710.779
closer and oh yeah it feels a little

1708.919 --> 1712.3990000000001
warm oh a little closer oh now it's

1710.779 --> 1714.74
getting kind of hot feel closer and then

1712.399 --> 1718.399
you burn your hand you know why

1714.74 --> 1720.7
because radiation heat is a proximity

1718.399 --> 1720.6999999999998
thing

1722.84 --> 1727.6999999999998
right

1725.0 --> 1730.58
like warming up something

1727.7 --> 1733.8400000000001
with the laser over a vast distance is

1730.58 --> 1733.84
just impossible

1734.179 --> 1739.0590000000002
unless like it's insanely powerful but

1740.539 --> 1746.24
radiate real heat is a proximity thing

1743.84 --> 1751.039
it radiates through the material that

1746.24 --> 1754.299
gets eaten up and then it radiates out

1751.039 --> 1754.299
kind of short range

1754.399 --> 1757.9399999999998
right so where is this proximity heat

1756.62 --> 1759.9799999999998
from the Sun

1757.94 --> 1761.659
doesn't exist because you can't approach

1759.98 --> 1763.46
it you can only

1761.659 --> 1766.7
see it

1763.46 --> 1770.96
the angle of the sunlight manifestation

1766.7 --> 1774.5800000000002
and then it the sunlight being absorbed

1770.96 --> 1774.58
that's where the heat comes in

1780.64 --> 1787.2990000000002
holographic heat Source no no the light

1783.5 --> 1787.299
absorption is the heat source

1796.52 --> 1800.299
now that does that's not mechanically

1798.62 --> 1803.5
correct it

1800.299 --> 1806.24
light source

1803.5 --> 1808.96
well done

1806.24 --> 1808.96
think about it

1809.36 --> 1811.899
right

1812.36 --> 1815.84
there's energy being transferred all

1815.059 --> 1818.48
right

1815.84 --> 1821.299
it's probably coming from an electric

1818.48 --> 1823.58
ether of some sort the energy in the air

1821.299 --> 1826.539
must be coming from somewhere that's

1823.58 --> 1826.539
probably cyclical

1829.76 --> 1837.02
yeah but it's not like oh it is heat it

1834.559 --> 1839.96
moves through light from one spot to

1837.02 --> 1842.72
another and there

1839.96 --> 1845.539
it is absorbed and then

1842.72 --> 1847.34
yeah then the material becomes hot no

1845.539 --> 1851.24
it's just

1847.34 --> 1854.62
the light has it all in it

1851.24 --> 1854.6200000000001
and it manifests

1854.84 --> 1860.36
it just virtually appears out of nowhere

1857.6 --> 1865.12
and we get to see this yeah

1860.36 --> 1865.12
this Celestial disc as a side effect

1865.399 --> 1872.4189999999999
at the epicenter from where

1868.7 --> 1875.6200000000001
that specific light is manifesting in

1872.419 --> 1875.6200000000001
relation to the Observer

1879.279 --> 1888.26
yeah I know it's very complex I've been

1884.48 --> 1892.059
spending a lot of many years now trying

1888.26 --> 1892.059
to explain this

1895.58 --> 1901.279
yeah Antonio subredz was one of the few

1898.279 --> 1904.46
guys who actually respected my attempts

1901.279 --> 1906.74
in trying to explain this thing

1904.46 --> 1909.08
and then he started to calm yeah I went

1906.74 --> 1911.96
yeah he was like oh he's one of the

1909.08 --> 1914.1999999999998
potatoes but he did still respect my

1911.96 --> 1914.2
ideas

1914.299 --> 1919.46
like he he was interested in my

1916.58 --> 1923.019
holographics ideas

1919.46 --> 1923.019
because he had the talent

1938.899 --> 1944.08
like a manifesting laser hologram

1944.6 --> 1948.1999999999998
what

1946.399 --> 1951.62
I don't know what it

1948.2 --> 1955.7
laser hologram exactly is but

1951.62 --> 1958.1589999999999
look I I say holographic

1955.7 --> 1959.8990000000001
because it is a image of light that's

1958.159 --> 1961.22
what we see that's what the celestials

1959.899 --> 1962.84
are they're just an image of light

1961.22 --> 1965.539
they're not a source they're not an

1962.84 --> 1968.4399999999998
object like a lamp hanging in a

1965.539 --> 1968.44
euclidean position

1969.799 --> 1975.74
all the physical nature things don't

1973.46 --> 1978.14
apply to it you can't approach it and

1975.74 --> 1980.779
then see it grow bigger or more intense

1978.14 --> 1982.3990000000001
there's no proximity none of those

1980.779 --> 1984.519
things apply

1982.399 --> 1988.34
leaving all

1984.519 --> 1991.039
assumptions of physicality bear

1988.34 --> 1992.779
you can only calculate it in a model as

1991.039 --> 1995.0
such and then stick to that because

1992.779 --> 1997.76
there's no actual physical proof that

1995.0 --> 1999.94
any of it is physical and in literal

1997.76 --> 1999.94
position

2006.399 --> 2011.32
right and yeah to compare it with the

2008.86 --> 2013.6
technology a hologram

2011.32 --> 2016.899
yeah a hologram

2013.6 --> 2020.019
and not actual thing and not actual

2016.899 --> 2022.26
source of light can actually be powered

2020.019 --> 2022.26
but

2023.74 --> 2030.34
can be powered by light that includes

2026.32 --> 2032.1399999999999
heat so literally you can theoretically

2030.34 --> 2035.1399999999999
who was built

2032.14 --> 2039.039
as an experiment you could have a

2035.14 --> 2041.019
hologram give you sunburn

2039.039 --> 2043.6
even though

2041.019 --> 2046.059
it's not the original source of the

2043.6 --> 2048.399
light creating the Holograms it's just

2046.059 --> 2050.379
that image but it can be so bright that

2048.399 --> 2052.5
you could literally get sunburned from

2050.379 --> 2052.5
it

2053.139 --> 2057.82
right

2054.579 --> 2060.76
and that's that setup would be an

2057.82 --> 2065.139
assistance to the mind

2060.76 --> 2068.8590000000004
to figure out and to give it a framework

2065.139 --> 2071.379
how can I look at it as not being a lamp

2068.859 --> 2073.5989999999997
in a position

2071.379 --> 2075.2799999999997
like that thing that we see even so

2073.599 --> 2079.4190000000003
bright when there's no clouds in front

2075.28 --> 2083.32
of it that's not an object

2079.419 --> 2086.7599999999998
it's an apparent thing like a hole

2083.32 --> 2086.76
in Virtual space

2087.339 --> 2092.0789999999997
and an apparent origin point of so much

2090.22 --> 2094.72
light

2092.079 --> 2097.1800000000003
but it isn't actually an object there

2094.72 --> 2102.4199999999996
from which that light that you see is

2097.18 --> 2102.4199999999996
coming it's only a holographic origin

2102.46 --> 2107.46
another person very far away is gonna

2105.28 --> 2110.8
look at the same apparent coordinates

2107.46 --> 2113.2
and the sun isn't going to be there and

2110.8 --> 2116.44
the Shadows cast by their apparent Sun

2113.2 --> 2118.7799999999997
manifestation in their position

2116.44 --> 2122.619
is going to be very different to

2118.78 --> 2126.48
the first person's Shadow play

2122.619 --> 2126.48
because it's all holographic

2133.619 --> 2137.8
holographic sunburn is an interesting

2135.82 --> 2139.9
concept

2137.8 --> 2142.3590000000004
yeah I mean it's also a technical

2139.9 --> 2145.3
possibility but there's no purpose in

2142.359 --> 2147.16
really doing it it's just to assist the

2145.3 --> 2151.0600000000004
mind

2147.16 --> 2155.74
to realize yeah you can get burned from

2151.06 --> 2155.74
energy that's not literally coming

2155.98 --> 2162.3
from the original coordinates

2159.04 --> 2162.3
of the light source

2174.28 --> 2176.46
foreign

2217.5 --> 2222.599
so I hope that gives you something to

2220.18 --> 2222.5989999999997
think about

2230.74 --> 2236.9799999999996
because yeah the celestial lights are

2233.079 --> 2239.3390000000004
pretty fascinating and miraculous it

2236.98 --> 2239.339
might feel

2239.38 --> 2245.6800000000003
so easy to just start assuming certain

2242.26 --> 2246.88
things about it certain models

2245.68 --> 2249.3999999999996
but

2246.88 --> 2250.44
to actually realize what it really all

2249.4 --> 2255.42
is

2250.44 --> 2255.42
or yeah what it seems to be

2258.78 --> 2264.2200000000003
cross-referencing everything every

2261.04 --> 2265.9
observation any every data

2264.22 --> 2269.2599999999998
that's legitimate

2265.9 --> 2272.579
yeah that's pretty surreal reality is

2269.26 --> 2272.579
really surreal

2279.28 --> 2286.02
so a reflection is a hologram no

2282.579 --> 2286.02
reflection is a reflection

2289.48 --> 2296.56
but yeah a reflection

2292.839 --> 2299.339
indicates that there is euclidean nature

2296.56 --> 2299.339
after all though

2299.74 --> 2308.2
right because you can trace the

2302.859 --> 2310.96
reflector you can trace any mirror

2308.2 --> 2312.9399999999996
and then as you approach that mirror

2310.96 --> 2315.339
reflection position

2312.94 --> 2317.32
the angular size and the intensity of

2315.339 --> 2320.98
the light because of infras square law

2317.32 --> 2323.44
also intensifies

2320.98 --> 2325.72
until you hit that mirror

2323.44 --> 2327.94
right that doesn't happen with the sun

2325.72 --> 2330.4599999999996
with any of it there is no approach

2327.94 --> 2333.16
there is no angular size increase as you

2330.46 --> 2336.04
try to approach it

2333.16 --> 2338.92
there's no energy increase you don't

2336.04 --> 2341.079
absorb more

2338.92 --> 2345.16
sunlight even

2341.079 --> 2347.079
as you approach like at best the

2345.16 --> 2350.14
atmosphere the gases

2347.079 --> 2352.3
at higher altitude become less so

2350.14 --> 2354.5789999999997
there's basically Less in between the

2352.3 --> 2356.92
light manifestation so a little bit more

2354.579 --> 2359.26
light comes through

2356.92 --> 2363.099
but there's no other than that there's

2359.26 --> 2364.0
no real proximity increase effects in

2363.099 --> 2367.7200000000003
energy

2364.0 --> 2370.839
or angular size change it's you can't

2367.72 --> 2374.2599999999998
trace it back to a reflector

2370.839 --> 2376.56
and if it was literally mirroring off a

2374.26 --> 2381.9
dome you would

2376.56 --> 2381.9
absolutely you would you don't

2382.66 --> 2386.5789999999997
APG crucial I could see you

2392.5 --> 2397.32
what's the format what are you talking

2395.14 --> 2397.3199999999997
about

2397.72 --> 2400.859
hello Rob h

2414.88 --> 2417.94
that when you go up in the plane above

2416.68 --> 2419.0789999999997
the clouds it's really bright right

2417.94 --> 2421.78
because

2419.079 --> 2426.04
within the range of your vision there's

2421.78 --> 2428.52
less air absorbing the holographic light

2426.04 --> 2428.52
right

2435.88 --> 2441.4
like if you go in the ocean

2439.0 --> 2443.56
you can still see the holographic light

2441.4 --> 2445.6600000000003
but there's like a bit of water in

2443.56 --> 2448.2999999999997
between now if you go much much deeper

2445.66 --> 2450.339
then eventually you won't see it anymore

2448.3 --> 2453.46
it'll be too

2450.339 --> 2456.2799999999997
refracted to diffused by the

2453.46 --> 2459.42
much thicker water

2456.28 --> 2459.42
in liquid state

2460.24 --> 2463.02
so yeah

2463.359 --> 2469.7799999999997
higher up there is more sun intensity

2466.839 --> 2473.04
because the there's less gas around you

2469.78 --> 2473.0400000000004
absorbing at all

2477.16 --> 2482.46
I mean it's still manifesting from a

2479.92 --> 2482.46
certain direction

2486.7 --> 2493.06
it it does like go a distance because

2489.88 --> 2496.119
things can still block it

2493.06 --> 2499.0
it's just not coming from any specific

2496.119 --> 2500.6800000000003
object in any specific position it's

2499.0 --> 2505.02
just manifesting

2500.68 --> 2505.02
no Source just manifesting

2511.839 --> 2516.9
I mean is what are we talking oh we're

2514.06 --> 2516.9
talking what the

2517.0 --> 2521.7
no Gadget inspector what

2521.92 --> 2526.48
uh

2524.2 --> 2529.5989999999997
we're talking about the holographic Sun

2526.48 --> 2532.119
so far and yeah

2529.599 --> 2535.6800000000003
Antonio subarets

2532.119 --> 2535.6800000000003
I don't know if you've heard of him

2537.579 --> 2542.619
but apparently he's dead too now

2540.64 --> 2545.0789999999997
which is quite a shock to me because

2542.619 --> 2545.88
he's a first waiver and he was at the

2545.079 --> 2548.8590000000004
time

2545.88 --> 2551.52
also an inspiration in ways

2548.859 --> 2551.52
to me

2561.339 --> 2563.819
all right

2565.3 --> 2570.3390000000004
also because he did actually appreciate

2568.3 --> 2572.26
even spoke out about it he did

2570.339 --> 2575.64
appreciate

2572.26 --> 2575.6400000000003
my holographics

2578.26 --> 2584.5600000000004
was one of the few

2581.319 --> 2586.96
and he he did that pretty early on

2584.56 --> 2590.98
then eventually it all just became about

2586.96 --> 2594.48
just tag teaming and in fighting and

2590.98 --> 2594.48
yeah lost track

2596.859 --> 2602.46
Tony has been ill for at least a couple

2598.78 --> 2602.46
yes yeah he had cancer

2606.78 --> 2611.92
but yeah I don't know like if that is

2609.64 --> 2615.52
even involved like I don't know I don't

2611.92 --> 2618.96
have in from I just got the news

2615.52 --> 2618.96
through Adam basically

2619.18 --> 2622.319
I don't know where he is

2624.22 --> 2629.7999999999997
so this is just a fresh news flash

2626.8 --> 2629.8
basically

2649.119 --> 2652.079
foreign

2663.7 --> 2666.66
anyway

2673.72 --> 2679.06
did sever had stopped because he's been

2677.2 --> 2681.52
sick

2679.06 --> 2684.0
guys inspector that's why he stopped

2681.52 --> 2684.0
doing that

2688.54 --> 2693.96
right and look

2690.819 --> 2693.96
my opinion

2695.5 --> 2700.24
like the last couple of years were not

2697.78 --> 2703.5
super great

2700.24 --> 2706.72
just a lot of like rowdiness and just

2703.5 --> 2708.579
savanye in fighting and being all Snappy

2706.72 --> 2710.6189999999997
against others

2708.579 --> 2712.96
right I didn't like that

2710.619 --> 2715.96
I liked the first year

2712.96 --> 2718.48
what he did he was like unburdened by

2715.96 --> 2720.579
all that social drama [ __ ]

2718.48 --> 2723.7
mostly

2720.579 --> 2727.079
and he was just really focused on trying

2723.7 --> 2727.0789999999997
to figure it out and

2727.54 --> 2731.88
and he was an inspiration back then

2732.28 --> 2736.42
at this whole relationship with Patricia

2734.319 --> 2739.18
steer and was like glorious for a while

2736.42 --> 2741.52
and then like [ __ ] went wrong and they

2739.18 --> 2744.0989999999997
broke up and the infighting really

2741.52 --> 2746.56
started up and that's after that it just

2744.099 --> 2749.88
wasn't the same

2746.56 --> 2749.88
and I think he knew it

2756.04 --> 2759.96
yeah look so you can start with the

2758.319 --> 2763.359
whole

2759.96 --> 2765.16
rumor [ __ ] that he rolled out was so

2763.359 --> 2770.319
ridiculous

2765.16 --> 2774.06
that was just so embarrassing like

2770.319 --> 2774.06
you can't recover from that

2806.319 --> 2813.96
okay get your inspector what

2809.7 --> 2813.96
crime that sounds terrible

2817.42 --> 2822.88
right I don't need to

2820.42 --> 2827.52
get into like

2822.88 --> 2830.56
gamma hives to know how bad Gammas get

2827.52 --> 2833.22
not saying that it is but it does sound

2830.56 --> 2833.22
like that

2847.66 --> 2852.54
it's still Level stationary yeah

2849.88 --> 2852.54
absolutely

2853.78 --> 2855.9
okay

2863.16 --> 2869.339
Christy I think Patricia stare is a real

2866.26 --> 2869.3390000000004
woman yeah so do I

2871.0 --> 2873.72
absolutely

2879.7 --> 2884.3799999999997
right and to suggest that she wouldn't

2882.46 --> 2887.5
be after

2884.38 --> 2888.2200000000003
having a relationship and even like kind

2887.5 --> 2891.4
of

2888.22 --> 2895.3799999999997
through chats not overtly on a show but

2891.4 --> 2895.38
still brag about sex and [ __ ]

2895.599 --> 2901.2000000000003
and then afterwards say yeah she's not

2898.42 --> 2901.2000000000003
actually a woman

2902.38 --> 2908.319
that really kind of sounds ridiculous

2905.079 --> 2910.42
you know I mean if you just went on a

2908.319 --> 2912.7
date

2910.42 --> 2914.38
and then you figured it out

2912.7 --> 2917.68
sure

2914.38 --> 2919.839
but if you live with her for like half a

2917.68 --> 2922.1189999999997
year

2919.839 --> 2924.16
that's all you buddy

2922.119 --> 2926.98
that's all you

2924.16 --> 2930.359
and everybody knew that

2926.98 --> 2930.359
anybody that cared

2931.72 --> 2934.74
hey good servant

2945.579 --> 2950.94
okay Gadget inspector if you're into

2948.16 --> 2950.94
that sort of thing

2952.059 --> 2957.4
I I don't really find it entertaining to

2955.0 --> 2960.579
see people burn themselves up

2957.4 --> 2963.819
like and cause serious physical harm to

2960.579 --> 2966.76
through to themselves through paranoia

2963.819 --> 2969.359
and anxiety I don't really like looking

2966.76 --> 2969.3590000000004
at that

2974.02 --> 2977.4
seems a bit sadistic

2986.14 --> 2989.0989999999997
a Cleary

3005.94 --> 3010.559
yeah good servant apparently is doing

3008.16 --> 3013.52
now two streams a day

3010.559 --> 3013.52
so he's like

3013.98 --> 3020.28
he's really

3016.319 --> 3022.619
yeah he's into it

3020.28 --> 3024.2400000000002
it's pretty cool dude I mean I don't

3022.619 --> 3027.54
really follow it

3024.24 --> 3031.5789999999997
I don't like certain exoteric elements

3027.54 --> 3031.579
you know which you keep in there

3033.059 --> 3038.76
I used to know that as Christ allergy

3036.48 --> 3040.5
but yeah I've learned from that since

3038.76 --> 3043.2000000000003
and

3040.5 --> 3046.079
it's more like spell

3043.2 --> 3048.359
priesthood spells

3046.079 --> 3051.6600000000003
but yeah

3048.359 --> 3054.48
you're sounding pretty good and your

3051.66 --> 3056.5789999999997
chat room seems quite vibrant so

3054.48 --> 3058.14
good to hear you're still at it it's

3056.579 --> 3060.1800000000003
hard work

3058.14 --> 3064.22
is it

3060.18 --> 3064.22
you seem to be doing just fine

3089.7 --> 3096.5589999999997
Jake the [ __ ] is going crazy

3093.42 --> 3096.559
I bet he is

3097.2 --> 3102.96
I must be squirting like crazy indeed

3100.619 --> 3105.859
not that I really care to

3102.96 --> 3105.859
check that out

3107.52 --> 3113.52
but yeah especially people that are like

3110.76 --> 3117.78
halfway per in order and like oh no see

3113.52 --> 3121.2
all the flat earthers are being removed

3117.78 --> 3124.3100000000004
through the shadow realm the ancestral

3121.2 --> 3127.319
winds are coming to take us away

3124.31 --> 3128.88
[Music]

3127.319 --> 3130.74
yeah

3128.88 --> 3134.7000000000003
lots of people

3130.74 --> 3137.52
will probably be kind of freaked out

3134.7 --> 3139.7999999999997
or think it's all just a crisis acted

3137.52 --> 3142.619
like everything is good like nobody dies

3139.8 --> 3144.119
they're all just stepping down from

3142.619 --> 3146.339
their act

3144.119 --> 3149.0
and getting another life

3146.339 --> 3149.0
sure

3153.119 --> 3158.2200000000003
hey Bax hey good to see you man yeah I

3156.0 --> 3159.9
got your PayPal donation yesterday thank

3158.22 --> 3161.64
you very much

3159.9 --> 3165.319
that's awesome

3161.64 --> 3165.319
you are absolved of being gay

3165.72 --> 3170.3999999999996
not that I thought you were

3168.78 --> 3173.3
what I really appreciate the support

3170.4 --> 3173.3
thank you very much

3186.559 --> 3190.4
yeah it's good to have support

3190.74 --> 3194.1189999999997
especially in Winter times

3195.079 --> 3202.98
keeps you warm

3197.88 --> 3202.98
literally and metaphorically

3209.94 --> 3215.66
right so yeah what else is going on out

3212.28 --> 3215.6600000000003
there think of like

3216.9 --> 3220.2200000000003
Antonio had his moment

3231.24 --> 3237.359
oh Sean Hawkins shared did Sean Hawkins

3234.839 --> 3239.04
shared it he always gives me this stupid

3237.359 --> 3240.96
notification even though I'm not even

3239.04 --> 3244.22
subscribed to him

3240.96 --> 3244.2200000000003
shared your video

3246.42 --> 3249.66
thanks Sean

3248.16 --> 3252.02
don't know what you think you're doing

3249.66 --> 3252.02
but

3253.44 --> 3255.859
whatever

3256.859 --> 3262.4
what did Antonio do now he died that's

3259.92 --> 3262.4
what he did

3265.02 --> 3268.02
foreign

3295.559 --> 3299.57
foreign

3296.36 --> 3299.57
[Applause]

3327.119 --> 3329.359
foreign

3332.22 --> 3335.22
therapy

3335.579 --> 3341.48
uh

3337.859 --> 3341.48
I don't know steamy Traveler

3351.54 --> 3354.14
look

3354.54 --> 3358.799
okay

3355.94 --> 3360.9
I don't know if it if it helps it helps

3358.799 --> 3362.94
I'm not really focusing on like people

3360.9 --> 3365.04
that are really heavy addicts and all

3362.94 --> 3367.64
that and how do you break them out

3365.04 --> 3367.64
no

3369.54 --> 3373.5589999999997
maybe with like heavy hard drugs or

3371.94 --> 3376.52
something that works

3373.559 --> 3376.52
I don't know man

3378.359 --> 3384.72
just don't allow yourself to ever go

3381.18 --> 3387.0
there that's that's been my policy

3384.72 --> 3390.24
like I'm already

3387.0 --> 3393.54
yeah I don't need like really really

3390.24 --> 3395.819
hard drugs ever like I'm already like I

3393.54 --> 3398.339
got plenty with cannabis

3395.819 --> 3401.04
I got plenty with just my couple of

3398.339 --> 3405.42
beers I really don't need anything more

3401.04 --> 3409.38
than that like at all like no thanks

3405.42 --> 3411.359
and I got my natural pineal gland

3409.38 --> 3413.88
like

3411.359 --> 3417.44
I don't need even mushrooms or anything

3413.88 --> 3417.44
nothing like

3418.26 --> 3424.5200000000004
just a couple of beers sometimes well

3420.78 --> 3424.52
it's been regularly now

3425.099 --> 3431.099
and cannabis and yeah cannabis has been

3428.64 --> 3434.339
kind of my

3431.099 --> 3436.44
my issue drug because I've had times

3434.339 --> 3438.54
where I was doing not great and it

3436.44 --> 3440.46
wasn't really working out for me like

3438.54 --> 3441.96
the chemistry would kind of be all wrong

3440.46 --> 3443.819
because it just

3441.96 --> 3446.64
was out of it and then you can get

3443.819 --> 3448.38
paranoid and [ __ ] from it

3446.64 --> 3451.02
so I've had some like

3448.38 --> 3454.079
bad Cycles with it

3451.02 --> 3456.48
which really is a sign that like there

3454.079 --> 3459.079
is an addiction

3456.48 --> 3459.079
but

3464.46 --> 3469.079
that's kind of secondary

3466.559 --> 3470.7000000000003
so yeah it's just all about like just

3469.079 --> 3472.98
don't allow your

3470.7 --> 3474.72
your spirit to dwell don't start

3472.98 --> 3477.119
ignoring things don't

3474.72 --> 3481.16
don't do your drugs to try and forget

3477.119 --> 3481.1600000000003
about things that you feel bad about

3481.799 --> 3488.66
that's it

3483.18 --> 3488.66
I I don't need anything else really

3489.119 --> 3494.28
Duke

3491.04 --> 3496.88
oh it's a slang for homosexual

3494.28 --> 3496.88
never

3497.94 --> 3501.7400000000002
I meant like the

3500.099 --> 3505.1400000000003
Tinkerbell

3501.74 --> 3507.7799999999997
is yeah I sorry I can't help that

3505.14 --> 3510.9
everything's called like is associated

3507.78 --> 3513.8390000000004
with homosexual like it's a fairy wizard

3510.9 --> 3517.38
it's a wizard that deals with

3513.839 --> 3519.7799999999997
Aries with the fairy world it is

3517.38 --> 3523.579
from the Irish lore from the Celtic Lord

3519.78 --> 3523.579
and he was into that

3525.059 --> 3528.6800000000003
I don't think he was like

3529.2 --> 3532.819
ugh just

3533.72 --> 3538.9399999999996
I don't know I don't want to know

3545.099 --> 3552.26
but would maybe Faye wizard but it might

3549.0 --> 3552.26
just mean the same thing

3554.16 --> 3557.72
I could call it Faye

3560.88 --> 3563.599
is that better

3564.359 --> 3569.0
they're not Faye with an a with an e

3587.339 --> 3590.18
all right

3599.22 --> 3601.22
um

3618.299 --> 3622.22
Only the Good Die Young that's

3622.5 --> 3627.299
how do you know

3624.48 --> 3630.18
like how well did you know Antonio

3627.299 --> 3631.68
subarets

3630.18 --> 3634.6189999999997
cause

3631.68 --> 3636.839
I didn't I thought the guy was yeah

3634.619 --> 3639.42
don't want to talk bad about him

3636.839 --> 3640.92
afterward right first and foremost I

3639.42 --> 3645.48
want to remember the good parts about

3640.92 --> 3648.059
him but dude the guy was like kind of a

3645.48 --> 3651.839
sociopath a lot of the time

3648.059 --> 3654.299
and so slippery and evasive like he got

3651.839 --> 3657.42
pretty bad

3654.299 --> 3659.579
last few times I've seen him online it

3657.42 --> 3664.26
was just like gross

3659.579 --> 3666.2400000000002
super savanye so was he really good

3664.26 --> 3670.92
I don't know

3666.24 --> 3674.7599999999998
he was talented was he good moral

3670.92 --> 3675.9
I don't think so not me I

3674.76 --> 3679.88
so

3675.9 --> 3679.88
yeah lying is not healthy indeed

3682.26 --> 3688.92
so yeah I I disagree with that statement

3686.52 --> 3691.92
also because I want to live a long life

3688.92 --> 3691.92
somehow

3691.98 --> 3696.02
but still remain

3696.66 --> 3701.42
some part of youthful innocence in the

3699.119 --> 3701.42
process

3701.94 --> 3707.119
and not let time wear me all down in

3704.94 --> 3707.119
spirit

3709.38 --> 3715.579
he wasn't a globe app so he was good wow

3712.92 --> 3715.579
subtle

3720.18 --> 3726.319
no no just because you're a flat earther

3723.0 --> 3726.319
does not mean you're good

3726.839 --> 3731.48
there are some nasty ass flat earthers

3729.18 --> 3731.48
out there

3735.599 --> 3740.2200000000003
right

3737.339 --> 3742.619
this is not a uh a black and white

3740.22 --> 3745.4399999999996
situation here

3742.619 --> 3747.48
morality is morality it's all about your

3745.44 --> 3749.2200000000003
personal code of conduct and just how

3747.48 --> 3751.26
you see the world

3749.22 --> 3754.5589999999997
and he

3751.26 --> 3758.059
Antonio subreds was kind of like chaotic

3754.559 --> 3758.059
neutral at best

3758.28 --> 3762.8390000000004
and yes I realized that's a DND

3760.799 --> 3763.799
terminology but if you know what that

3762.839 --> 3766.859
means

3763.799 --> 3769.5
yeah those charts are pretty decent

3766.859 --> 3771.66
they're basic

3769.5 --> 3774.72
they're not super existentially

3771.66 --> 3776.7
complicated they're not as dynamic as

3774.72 --> 3777.72
reality tends to be when it comes to

3776.7 --> 3780.299
like

3777.72 --> 3782.3999999999996
a whole bunch of things but yeah it's an

3780.299 --> 3784.319
it's a good preliminary indicator and

3782.4 --> 3787.28
dude Antonio superint was chaotic

3784.319 --> 3787.2799999999997
neutral as [ __ ]

3788.16 --> 3796.0989999999997
not good not a good guy

3791.4 --> 3796.099
he even like scoffed at that

3796.38 --> 3799.099
at times

3824.7 --> 3826.8799999999997
foreign

3865.38 --> 3871.28
yeah Jimmy Jedi

3867.48 --> 3871.28
you mean GB Jedi clearance

3896.16 --> 3899.52
yeah which by the way still freaks me

3898.319 --> 3903.599
out because

3899.52 --> 3905.579
a whole long time ago some some troll I

3903.599 --> 3908.6400000000003
think it's just some trolls like told me

3905.579 --> 3910.92
like Jimmy dead eyes dead and I really

3908.64 --> 3913.44
bought it back then like I really fell

3910.92 --> 3916.98
for it because there were like multiple

3913.44 --> 3918.839
trolls in on it fooling people about it

3916.98 --> 3922.28
I got all rolled into thinking it was

3918.839 --> 3925.44
real and then kind of left it didn't

3922.28 --> 3928.2000000000003
really trace it back to the source to

3925.44 --> 3930.9
really see if it was out there

3928.2 --> 3934.02
and then kind of forgot about it so I

3930.9 --> 3936.359
have my own personal Mandela effect sort

3934.02 --> 3938.52
of because of that it's really weird to

3936.359 --> 3942.98
hear like oh yeah he just died like what

3938.52 --> 3942.98
but he died like a year ago

3943.38 --> 3947.1600000000003
this is really weird

3944.94 --> 3951.0
when did he die uh

3947.16 --> 3954.74
what is it like a month ago or something

3951.0 --> 3954.74
maybe two I don't remember exactly

3967.079 --> 3972.299
that time is all just

3970.26 --> 3975.96
going all over the place it's hard to

3972.299 --> 3979.74
keep track one exactly what happens

3975.96 --> 3982.859
anymore never been a real star at it

3979.74 --> 3984.839
I do my best though

3982.859 --> 3987.319
The ancestral wins aren't exactly

3984.839 --> 3987.319
helping

4024.98 --> 4029.14
right

4026.48 --> 4029.14
anyway

4029.78 --> 4033.3390000000004
oh wow

4033.619 --> 4037.539
this guy's really cleared up let's just

4037.64 --> 4041.5
remember we're still here

4045.02 --> 4048.16
look at that contrail

4053.119 --> 4058.059
right but yeah it's looking quite

4055.339 --> 4058.0589999999997
beautiful outside

4063.38 --> 4065.559
foreign

4095.56 --> 4102.5599999999995
yeah so anyway yeah the ancestor winds

4098.659 --> 4105.259
are raging I didn't think that there

4102.56 --> 4108.259
would be so many people

4105.259 --> 4111.56
I knew through the internet would

4108.259 --> 4115.339
suddenly just drop like that

4111.56 --> 4117.5
in such a short period of time

4115.339 --> 4120.1
I hope this is going to be the end of it

4117.5 --> 4120.1
but

4121.219 --> 4126.259
yeah my subconscious tells me that

4123.38 --> 4129.14
that's not the case

4126.259 --> 4132.62
that is probably Gonna Keep On

4129.14 --> 4134.6
being on this level not just for us but

4132.62 --> 4136.46
for the world

4134.6 --> 4139.839
probably

4136.46 --> 4139.839
until February

4142.4 --> 4146.3589999999995
that's my forecast

4145.1 --> 4148.04
yeah

4146.359 --> 4150.219
there were going to be a heavy one this

4148.04 --> 4150.219
time

4152.9 --> 4158.98
what happens to YouTube content if the

4155.6 --> 4158.9800000000005
channel owner dies I don't know

4171.199 --> 4177.04
I have perhaps like the family gets to

4174.199 --> 4177.04
say over that

4179.179 --> 4185.0
like who even does inherent your YouTube

4182.239 --> 4188.3189999999995
channel when you pass away how does that

4185.0 --> 4188.319
work I don't know

4209.32 --> 4214.239
right anyway be right back two minutes

4288.739 --> 4290.919999999999
foreign

4295.34 --> 4297.52
foreign

4314.48 --> 4318.5599999999995
yeah I'm pretty sure geoshifter

4316.28 --> 4321.62
remembers him too

4318.56 --> 4324.280000000001
it was gear shifter is technically like

4321.62 --> 4324.28
second wave

4324.8 --> 4327.6990000000005
just like myself

4327.98 --> 4338.62
I remember like yeah our activities

4333.14 --> 4338.62
from the past so yeah shocking isn't it

4342.5 --> 4346.6
yeah me too I remember those days

4383.48 --> 4386.48
foreign

4413.44 --> 4420.199
live in the same time well they live

4416.54 --> 4424.78
pretty close I think towards Sanford and

4420.199 --> 4424.78
Adam has had like he

4425.3 --> 4431.179
had some involvement with Antonio in

4428.6 --> 4433.360000000001
recent that yeah in the recent year or

4431.179 --> 4433.36
something

4450.8 --> 4456.88
is this a Java Deva I don't think so

4453.679 --> 4456.88
clutch no

4458.84 --> 4464.659000000001
I can't imagine Antonio sumerets ever

4462.02 --> 4468.76
taking the V

4464.659 --> 4468.759999999999
he would be terrified to do that

4473.36 --> 4479.48
no but he also had cancer

4476.6 --> 4483.620000000001
and he had personal issues and yeah

4479.48 --> 4486.759999999999
there was the two things in kind of

4483.62 --> 4486.76
make it go pop

4488.239 --> 4492.739
in a way that's sort of what happened

4489.86 --> 4495.88
with my mom as well

4492.739 --> 4495.879999999999
a long time ago

4507.44 --> 4513.08
if he was getting cancer treatment no

4511.46 --> 4516.38
no he wasn't

4513.08 --> 4520.46
not like that I think unless dude unless

4516.38 --> 4522.92
that somehow eluded the my information

4520.46 --> 4525.26
unless I have been not

4522.92 --> 4527.4800000000005
unless I'm ill-informed about that maybe

4525.26 --> 4530.900000000001
he did I don't know

4527.48 --> 4533.678999999999
I didn't really keep close track of of

4530.9 --> 4533.679
his activities

4536.3 --> 4541.76
Adam has I think

4540.14 --> 4544.1
so

4541.76 --> 4546.6990000000005
yeah I'm I'm kind of just waiting for

4544.1 --> 4546.6990000000005
his input

4560.719 --> 4564.38
do we know where he lives no

4562.58 --> 4566.96
I don't

4564.38 --> 4569.679
I'm sure like the guys over at Flat

4566.96 --> 4569.679
Earth debate do

4571.219 --> 4576.44
like for a while

4574.04 --> 4578.6
Nathan Oakley and

4576.44 --> 4579.98
Antonio superettes were like pretty

4578.6 --> 4581.780000000001
close Buddies

4579.98 --> 4584.36
for a while

4581.78 --> 4586.759999999999
I know he's like

4584.36 --> 4588.08
shocked I know Nathan shocked about this

4586.76 --> 4590.6
as well

4588.08 --> 4593.8
but he might know where he is at or

4590.6 --> 4593.8
where he lived I don't know

4597.32 --> 4599.5
foreign

4602.32 --> 4610.12
pieces lately yeah in fighting backs

4605.9 --> 4610.12
that's just business as usual really

4611.659 --> 4615.5199999999995
it kind of happens every year

4616.4 --> 4623.48
The ancestral wins come people

4619.76 --> 4627.02
get all riled up paranoia

4623.48 --> 4630.08
overly energized but without actual

4627.02 --> 4631.2390000000005
Insight what they're doing too much they

4630.08 --> 4634.46
get

4631.239 --> 4636.44
obsessed with things

4634.46 --> 4640.04
and yeah

4636.44 --> 4643.219
in the Flat Earth that means like oh

4640.04 --> 4645.62
look they're agents oh it's all the

4643.219 --> 4648.26
crisis act oh

4645.62 --> 4650.36
look at all these virtuous signals that

4648.26 --> 4653.2390000000005
they're actually Illuminati or the

4650.36 --> 4656.54
[ __ ] and that's what happens

4653.239 --> 4659.839999999999
total savonia syndrome Breakout

4656.54 --> 4662.84
really annoying and you know who does

4659.84 --> 4665.719
that every single time

4662.84 --> 4668.3
because they always fall back into that

4665.719 --> 4670.34
type of thing all at the same time

4668.3 --> 4674.02
everybody does it they even sometimes

4670.34 --> 4674.02
conspire together to do that

4674.54 --> 4680.36
and

4676.82 --> 4684.04
so did Antonio super rats by the way he

4680.36 --> 4684.04
was doing that as well

4685.94 --> 4690.82
he was a savonie

4687.98 --> 4690.82
in the end

4713.719 --> 4716.26
all right

4720.38 --> 4726.4400000000005
everyone have to put together towards

4722.9 --> 4730.5199999999995
the ultimate truth no no backs no they

4726.44 --> 4732.259999999999
don't not when everybody's like this

4730.52 --> 4734.96
everybody actually kind of needs their

4732.26 --> 4737.2390000000005
space a little

4734.96 --> 4739.219
otherwise you get on each other's nerves

4737.239 --> 4741.0199999999995
and then before you know it you have

4739.219 --> 4743.659
infighting and if you then don't deal

4741.02 --> 4747.38
with that wisely then you get fronts

4743.659 --> 4750.08
then you get kind of like a verbal Civil

4747.38 --> 4753.56
War situation going that happens in this

4750.08 --> 4756.92
time it's the time of the year

4753.56 --> 4760.580000000001
it's called Autumn

4756.92 --> 4762.38
the energies changes the energies are

4760.58 --> 4765.14
person

4762.38 --> 4768.56
and our senses are being subjected to

4765.14 --> 4771.14
shifts around we change

4768.56 --> 4772.76
and then after that's over and it can

4771.14 --> 4775.6990000000005
take a while can be pretty intense

4772.76 --> 4780.5
sometimes and it is this year after that

4775.699 --> 4782.719
it changes back it's another mode

4780.5 --> 4785.239
Everything Changes the social chemistry

4782.719 --> 4787.1
tends to change

4785.239 --> 4789.739
some people get really really

4787.1 --> 4793.179
complaining about things other people

4789.739 --> 4796.759999999999
get super aggressive some people get

4793.179 --> 4798.62
Ultra Ultra stubborn about useless

4796.76 --> 4801.56
things and get all into psychological

4798.62 --> 4804.0199999999995
warfare on a high level for no reason

4801.56 --> 4806.54
right I call that leprechaun syndrome

4804.02 --> 4808.639
now I just called it leprechauns in them

4806.54 --> 4811.4
that's very niche

4808.639 --> 4813.86
you have to be super talented to do that

4811.4 --> 4816.62
Antonio subarets had that too a lot

4813.86 --> 4818.54
because he was very talented

4816.62 --> 4822.199
right

4818.54 --> 4824.54
it's the times of the ancestral wins

4822.199 --> 4827.0
and in Flat Earth scene that means

4824.54 --> 4828.92
freaking infighting and like paranoia

4827.0 --> 4831.08
about who's an agent and who's secretly

4828.92 --> 4834.5
there to fool everybody and Scandal

4831.08 --> 4838.0
Scandal Scandal slander slander slander

4834.5 --> 4838.0
it's very embarrassing

4839.6 --> 4845.780000000001
but it's basically filling the market

4841.82 --> 4849.44
for Hungry Wolf hordes

4845.78 --> 4851.599999999999
for yeah on the spiritual level

4849.44 --> 4853.699
so like a whole bunch of wolves and

4851.6 --> 4855.860000000001
they're like ah we're on the hunt to

4853.699 --> 4858.5599999999995
point at something we're gonna go after

4855.86 --> 4861.699
it yeah

4858.56 --> 4861.6990000000005
that's what's happening

4863.84 --> 4867.7390000000005
people don't want to be all peaceful

4866.42 --> 4870.5
together

4867.739 --> 4872.36
not if you're if you're swept up by the

4870.5 --> 4874.94
ancestral wins that's not what you're

4872.36 --> 4876.98
going to be in the need for you want

4874.94 --> 4878.9
action you want to go at it you want the

4876.98 --> 4880.94
brawl

4878.9 --> 4883.719
physically or spiritually some people

4880.94 --> 4883.719
get really physical

4884.179 --> 4887.679
especially like if they're

4888.199 --> 4894.379999999999
very physically oriented and developed

4892.04 --> 4896.06
then those guys really want to brawl

4894.38 --> 4897.4400000000005
they want to test themselves they want

4896.06 --> 4899.92
to get in the ring

4897.44 --> 4899.919999999999
right

4903.679 --> 4909.7390000000005
kindergartens Yeah well yeah in a way

4906.02 --> 4912.46
you Resort back to another mode

4909.739 --> 4912.459999999999
for me

4913.219 --> 4920.54
what happens typically is I go back

4916.82 --> 4924.259999999999
to like well revisiting all Trauma from

4920.54 --> 4928.88
school era and I fall back into like in

4924.26 --> 4931.280000000001
a mode where I'm emotionally less

4928.88 --> 4933.92
competent to deal

4931.28 --> 4936.44
with social situations it's really

4933.92 --> 4938.6
embarrassing there's absolutely nothing

4936.44 --> 4941.0599999999995
I can do about it when I'm stuck in that

4938.6 --> 4943.04
except sit it out and when people then

4941.06 --> 4945.92
keep on poking me hey why don't you just

4943.04 --> 4949.46
go back to normal oh look at him oh

4945.92 --> 4953.0
that's like super painful

4949.46 --> 4955.34
and that's what happened the other time

4953.0 --> 4957.44
on the Flat Earth debates and tenth man

4955.34 --> 4958.96
just kept poking me and poking me and

4957.44 --> 4961.5199999999995
then

4958.96 --> 4964.1
sleeping Warrior made a joke about it as

4961.52 --> 4966.5
he always does that's his effect

4964.1 --> 4968.6
he typically does that during this era

4966.5 --> 4970.94
during such period

4968.6 --> 4973.6
I get riled up and then 10th Man starts

4970.94 --> 4973.599999999999
doing it again

4974.6 --> 4979.54
and he was kind of being like that and

4976.52 --> 4979.540000000001
yesterday's show too

4979.639 --> 4983.12
not to me though I kind of kept to the

4981.86 --> 4987.08
background

4983.12 --> 4992.38
but it's still going the restlessness

4987.08 --> 4992.38
Resort for going back to a previous mode

4994.28 --> 4998.48
and then things you work differently

4996.26 --> 5001.4800000000005
your energy Dynamics your

4998.48 --> 5004.659
natural responses just work according to

5001.48 --> 5008.28
the older system not the fully developed

5004.659 --> 5008.28
updated clear-headed system

5011.8 --> 5017.26
No Bad Karma is very unlikely that that

5014.86 --> 5018.94
happened no

5017.26 --> 5021.54
it's no mention of any vaccine

5018.94 --> 5021.54
involvement

5022.0 --> 5026.38
but I yeah

5024.34 --> 5028.4800000000005
we'll find out

5026.38 --> 5030.82
hopefully

5028.48 --> 5033.159
I don't have any information other than

5030.82 --> 5035.34
what I've shared

5033.159 --> 5035.339999999999
foreign

5059.44 --> 5062.58
now I want coffee

5083.86 --> 5089.32
right yeah Bex

5086.199 --> 5091.659
low Vibe kindergarten stuff yeah that's

5089.32 --> 5094.84
what the ancestral winds do to you now

5091.659 --> 5098.259999999999
normally even when like in the middle of

5094.84 --> 5100.719
the summer or spring you could get into

5098.26 --> 5104.7390000000005
a low Vibe situation and then not

5100.719 --> 5106.9
everybody might deal with that correctly

5104.739 --> 5110.32
but that's not something that everybody

5106.9 --> 5111.699
automatically gets stuck in and pulled

5110.32 --> 5116.92
along into

5111.699 --> 5116.919999999999
that really happens during autumn

5118.179 --> 5123.82
that's where everybody gets

5121.239 --> 5126.58
kind of swept the Bay by law it's just

5123.82 --> 5128.5
like the spiritual wind start raging The

5126.58 --> 5131.08
ancestral winds that's why I call it the

5128.5 --> 5132.159
ancestral winds it's really

5131.08 --> 5135.0
yeah

5132.159 --> 5135.0
intuitive

5161.08 --> 5168.639
they will put him down as a code

5164.92 --> 5171.34
uh they love to do that

5168.639 --> 5173.92
I mean there's a bunch of newspaper guys

5171.34 --> 5176.4400000000005
that are like just waiting for flat

5173.92 --> 5178.54
earthers any every time the flatter

5176.44 --> 5182.199
whatever happens

5178.54 --> 5183.88
they're gonna try to mock us for our

5182.199 --> 5186.96
positions

5183.88 --> 5186.96
of course they will

5190.239 --> 5194.879999999999
I would not be surprised at all if that

5192.639 --> 5194.88
happened

5199.84 --> 5205.38
hey Aries 106 yeah

5202.6 --> 5205.38
I know

5214.12 --> 5217.92
don't let them go under your skin

5221.98 --> 5224.5199999999995
right

5232.48 --> 5239.98
but like yeah I don't know only people

5235.84 --> 5244.3
that care about those types of news

5239.98 --> 5245.739
are people that we hate naturally like

5244.3 --> 5247.54
those are the only ones that are

5245.739 --> 5250.239
actually going to like that

5247.54 --> 5252.82
so like yeah

5250.239 --> 5255.099999999999
that type of news is specifically

5252.82 --> 5257.679
directed

5255.1 --> 5261.1
put on a certain frequency to catch

5257.679 --> 5263.639
people in there that are like that so

5261.1 --> 5263.639
it's not

5265.3 --> 5271.12
yeah

5267.699 --> 5274.5599999999995
it's not like everybody's news just

5271.12 --> 5274.5599999999995
because they get a lot of room

5277.96 --> 5281.139
there's going to be plenty of people

5279.639 --> 5283.3
that are going to look at that even if

5281.139 --> 5285.88
they didn't know about Flat Earth or

5283.3 --> 5287.92
they didn't know about this guy that it

5285.88 --> 5292.54
might bump into that and be like

5287.92 --> 5295.06
this looks so bad this looks just like

5292.54 --> 5296.92
like another mockery like why are they

5295.06 --> 5298.42
always going after the flat earthers

5296.92 --> 5299.9800000000005
right that's going to be a lot of the

5298.42 --> 5302.5
natural response too

5299.98 --> 5306.839999999999
like that seems excessive why are you

5302.5 --> 5306.84
being so harsh to the guy that just died

5307.0 --> 5312.52
so

5308.8 --> 5314.38
don't always assume the worst in

5312.52 --> 5318.280000000001
people's responses

5314.38 --> 5320.92
like a lot of the misinformation is

5318.28 --> 5323.38
is just like a net for gamma's they're

5320.92 --> 5326.08
just trying to catch gammas

5323.38 --> 5329.139
catch their attention

5326.08 --> 5331.739
yeah put them in the seat and yeah make

5329.139 --> 5331.7390000000005
them squirt

5333.239 --> 5340.199
but they're not as popular as they try

5336.52 --> 5340.1990000000005
to make you believe they are

5358.56 --> 5363.96
I'm really happy by the way I got my

5361.0 --> 5363.96
vitamin C back

5366.34 --> 5370.32
I definitely needed that

5374.44 --> 5379.239
foreign

5376.44 --> 5383.46
those supplements are like a lot cheaper

5379.239 --> 5383.459999999999
than if I like buy orange juice

5385.96 --> 5390.76
although that's a lot tastier but yeah

5388.06 --> 5392.9800000000005
it's not time of the year for that I

5390.76 --> 5394.900000000001
like orange juice a lot like during

5392.98 --> 5398.339999999999
springtime

5394.9 --> 5398.339999999999
that's when I really like it

5404.199 --> 5410.219
and

5405.94 --> 5410.219
I guess like late summer also

5428.139 --> 5435.84
yeah organic sieve well I got there's

5431.38 --> 5435.84
all kinds of vitamin C guys all kinds

5436.9 --> 5442.48
it's like basically pick

5439.54 --> 5444.04
pick a type pick a type of source now I

5442.48 --> 5447.48
personally

5444.04 --> 5447.48
really like this one

5448.239 --> 5452.94
vitamin C based on Camus berries

5454.42 --> 5459.9400000000005
like I think it seems to be working out

5457.719 --> 5462.6
great there's all kinds of different

5459.94 --> 5462.599999999999
sorts

5463.54 --> 5471.42
that you can take I like this one

5466.719 --> 5471.42
and yeah royal green is a good brand

5472.48 --> 5475.379999999999
good enough

5475.54 --> 5481.38
I hope they haven't

5477.159 --> 5481.379999999999
gone too Global it's probably not

5486.88 --> 5490.6
symptoms yeah

5494.739 --> 5501.12
got a screenshot

5496.78 --> 5501.12
right I like royal green as a

5501.219 --> 5505.659
it's not super mainstream they're not

5503.739 --> 5507.638999999999
like aggressive Mega Corporation but

5505.659 --> 5508.9
they were really always about organic

5507.639 --> 5511.0
stuff

5508.9 --> 5513.94
so they're they're like

5511.0 --> 5516.28
yeah I find these supplements like in

5513.94 --> 5518.739
the organic grocery store

5516.28 --> 5521.44
and even before that

5518.739 --> 5523.12
I've been like yeah when I started out

5521.44 --> 5525.94
eating or getting and trying out

5523.12 --> 5528.34
supplements royal green even back then

5525.94 --> 5531.759999999999
was a good brand there were some others

5528.34 --> 5535.08
like new chapter was good but then it

5531.76 --> 5538.659000000001
got bought up by like

5535.08 --> 5541.12
glycine what is it that big Mega

5538.659 --> 5546.0599999999995
chemical company and then it got ruined

5541.12 --> 5546.0599999999995
well these guys haven't been bought up

5547.48 --> 5551.28
they've been pretty good for a while

5551.56 --> 5555.179
and there's some other brands too

5560.38 --> 5568.1990000000005
vitamin C and Zinc yeah I got I got

5564.159 --> 5568.199
zinc to vitamin D3

5569.08 --> 5574.54
right but when it comes to vitamin C

5571.78 --> 5576.759999999999
there's all kinds of different sorts of

5574.54 --> 5579.04
vitamin C supplements

5576.76 --> 5581.139
from different you can get like vitamin

5579.04 --> 5582.699
C out of certain mushrooms you can get

5581.139 --> 5584.88
them out of these berries you can get

5582.699 --> 5584.879999999999
them

5584.98 --> 5590.98
if you even can make it pretty easily

5587.679 --> 5593.02
chemically like even just like the

5590.98 --> 5597.839999999999
standard

5593.02 --> 5597.84
Yellow powder type of vitamin C

5598.12 --> 5602.639
it's still pretty decent

5603.46 --> 5607.4800000000005
just if it's pure it's pretty good it

5605.86 --> 5610.9
doesn't really matter even if it's like

5607.48 --> 5613.299999999999
chemically worked on too much but yeah I

5610.9 --> 5616.36
prefer like

5613.3 --> 5617.9800000000005
more natural forms of it

5616.36 --> 5619.839999999999
and the

5617.98 --> 5622.659
kamu Berry

5619.84 --> 5624.6990000000005
that turned out to be yeah be very

5622.659 --> 5628.599999999999
effective for my body my body

5624.699 --> 5631.678999999999
assimilates it very eloquently and it's

5628.6 --> 5631.679
doing a lot of good for me

5635.739 --> 5640.32
like including for my skin I think

5642.6 --> 5646.659000000001
potatoes have a lot of I don't think so

5644.86 --> 5649.54
not potato no

5646.659 --> 5653.4
vitamin D I think you're was it vitamin

5649.54 --> 5653.4
D or E is in there

5653.8 --> 5657.3
especially in the peel

5658.239 --> 5661.739
sheep just gravel them up

5664.239 --> 5669.218999999999
well I'm a big fan of french fries

5666.219 --> 5669.219
organic

5669.34 --> 5674.52
nope it's sea level but no what

5678.82 --> 5681.179
really

5686.44 --> 5689.44
foreign

5708.159 --> 5711.42
let me see that

5715.42 --> 5721.86
all right

5717.34 --> 5721.860000000001
I'm not seeing any of that

5727.6 --> 5732.119000000001
I don't know what you're talking about I

5729.219 --> 5732.119
think you're mistaken

5737.46 --> 5745.659
broccoli yeah but they're so dude like

5743.139 --> 5746.7390000000005
eating good organic food especially

5745.659 --> 5750.5199999999995
fresh

5746.739 --> 5753.0
yeah there's that's where the nutritions

5750.52 --> 5753.0
really are

5760.239 --> 5764.5599999999995
I'm just not like a salad guy too much I

5763.659 --> 5768.4
mean

5764.56 --> 5770.56
if there is a salad it's organic

5768.4 --> 5773.619
that's awesome

5770.56 --> 5775.780000000001
I personally don't really like

5773.619 --> 5777.88
making salads all the time and eating

5775.78 --> 5780.759999999999
them

5777.88 --> 5783.76
I didn't know maybe it yeah

5780.76 --> 5786.52
it's just a guy thing I guess

5783.76 --> 5788.76
I do try to keep eating vegetables

5786.52 --> 5788.76
though

5789.34 --> 5795.04
but yeah for me the supplements are just

5791.56 --> 5799.26
working out great they really are

5795.04 --> 5799.26
and it's kind of cost effective too

5808.54 --> 5811.98
mashed potatoes huh

5813.04 --> 5818.28
yeah no potato of course staple food

5815.44 --> 5821.5599999999995
dude I'm I'm Dutch

5818.28 --> 5825.94
I'm Dutch like potatoes are our staple

5821.56 --> 5828.34
food that's like we conquered the potato

5825.94 --> 5830.5
during the colonization and now it's

5828.34 --> 5832.8
ours you can't take the potatoes away

5830.5 --> 5832.8
again

5837.699 --> 5842.919999999999
yeah so we're all about French fries and

5840.58 --> 5845.619
mashed potatoes with

5842.92 --> 5849.34
with gravy in there and

5845.619 --> 5852.9
yeah that's very Dutch

5849.34 --> 5852.900000000001
very classical Dutch

5854.679 --> 5861.28
you make mashed potatoes into a volcano

5858.1 --> 5864.159000000001
and then we pour in the gravy

5861.28 --> 5866.139
which represents the lava

5864.159 --> 5868.0599999999995
dude I used to play around with that as

5866.139 --> 5870.9400000000005
a kid all the time and like literally

5868.06 --> 5875.1
just make a little landscape on my plate

5870.94 --> 5875.099999999999
and then play a volcano that's erupting

5878.86 --> 5881.04
foreign

5888.88 --> 5896.139
yes Ryan Q Vincent yes indeed

5892.06 --> 5899.56
yes the guy has brought good input

5896.139 --> 5903.28
especially at the start

5899.56 --> 5906.04
he had a lot of talent but yeah he just

5903.28 --> 5908.08
turned into a complete souvenir and that

5906.04 --> 5911.08
absolutely did cap

5908.08 --> 5915.0599999999995
that skill Peak it took away the room he

5911.08 --> 5915.0599999999995
required to function on that high level

5915.4 --> 5920.94
it's been like that for a while but at

5917.92 --> 5920.9400000000005
the start he was great

5921.82 --> 5928.0599999999995
it's very inspiring to myself as well

5926.5 --> 5930.76
and he's been like one of the first

5928.06 --> 5934.3
people that ever even gave me any form

5930.76 --> 5936.159000000001
of recognition for my holographic Sun

5934.3 --> 5940.42
conception

5936.159 --> 5943.0
which I did present way in the start

5940.42 --> 5947.46
and they never forget that he actually

5943.0 --> 5947.46
like gave me kudos for that

5955.6 --> 5960.179
classic Third Kind potato volcano

5965.38 --> 5969.0
yeah hello by the way service day

6006.92 --> 6011.6
this food talk is making me hungry

6011.76 --> 6016.08
yeah because after the show and I am

6014.34 --> 6017.82
gonna go out for groceries and get a

6016.08 --> 6022.4
pizza

6017.82 --> 6022.4
looking forward to that a lot

6036.92 --> 6041.34
I'm probably gonna run around out the

6039.54 --> 6043.56
show soon

6041.34 --> 6047.34
I really hope the Flat Earth today is

6043.56 --> 6050.04
going to be less Rowdy this time

6047.34 --> 6052.639
because like yesterday it was it's

6050.04 --> 6052.639
tiresome

6052.98 --> 6056.718999999999
it is getting a little tiresome

6060.48 --> 6063.0199999999995
right

6066.659 --> 6070.58
I don't know what you guys think about

6068.28 --> 6070.58
it

6077.219 --> 6082.9800000000005
I mean it's been very interesting like

6080.3 --> 6086.219
fine-tuning the mechanical understanding

6082.98 --> 6088.379999999999
right that's the good part about it

6086.219 --> 6090.119
the not so good part is just the

6088.38 --> 6093.36
freaking stubbornness that's almost

6090.119 --> 6096.0
reaching political levels

6093.36 --> 6099.599999999999
that part is annoying

6096.0 --> 6102.3
it's not productive it it's just

6099.6 --> 6104.52
it's turning into like a polarized

6102.3 --> 6106.7390000000005
situation that starting to remind me

6104.52 --> 6110.540000000001
about like ballers

6106.739 --> 6110.54
and their stubbornness

6114.119 --> 6117.32
but yeah we'll see

6125.88 --> 6133.9400000000005
I use beer and beef stew with veggies

6129.54 --> 6133.94
hmm okay clutch interesting

6140.4 --> 6147.179
right so yeah have fun with the

6143.58 --> 6150.54
making all that food sounds delicious

6147.179 --> 6153.02
I'm just gonna get a pizza

6150.54 --> 6153.0199999999995
right

6169.219 --> 6174.179
steamed water to remove fluoride or

6172.32 --> 6176.58
evaporated right

6174.179 --> 6178.8
recondensated

6176.58 --> 6182.0
I just use

6178.8 --> 6182.0
a good water filter

6183.78 --> 6188.159
a

6185.46 --> 6190.679
like a ceramic filter with Filter

6188.159 --> 6193.879999999999
elements that filter it all out get the

6190.679 --> 6193.88
hell out of my chat

6215.159 --> 6219.259999999999
A1 photo unit by the way

6223.38 --> 6228.26
um

6224.88 --> 6233.119
right so yeah lots has happened

6228.26 --> 6233.119000000001
dislike suddenly gone very weird

6235.5 --> 6240.659
but now I don't know like how much the

6238.86 --> 6243.839999999999
trolls care

6240.659 --> 6246.659
I'm sad like I want to see the dislikes

6243.84 --> 6249.0
I want to see how much they squirt

6246.659 --> 6251.04
why did you do that to me Google

6249.0 --> 6253.26
why did you take the dislikes away I

6251.04 --> 6255.42
wanted my dislikes back

6253.26 --> 6257.9400000000005
I want everybody to see that there's

6255.42 --> 6261.179
people literally just

6257.94 --> 6264.138999999999
going all nuts

6261.179 --> 6264.139
and doing that

6273.199 --> 6280.379999999999
Anyway by the way thanks Bex for the 20

6316.619 --> 6322.5
really get anything out of it you see

if you want to support your Arwin your

6324.659 --> 6329.4

if you want to be a regular supporter

6331.139 --> 6335.0

6337.619 --> 6341.82
11 dislikes you have oh well I don't see

6340.38 --> 6344.76

6353.1 --> 6357.659000000001
yesterday I did see him so is it like a

6355.8 --> 6359.52
weird mixed up thing some people get to

6357.659 --> 6361.619
see the dislikes others don't like how

6359.52 --> 6364.52
does this even work

6361.619 --> 6364.5199999999995
I don't get it

only paid pal from here okay awesome

6371.219 --> 6373.639
really do

6374.1 --> 6378.84
because I still need it I got some debts

6377.1 --> 6381.860000000001
and they're not gonna go away by

6378.84 --> 6381.860000000001
themselves unfortunately

6382.199 --> 6386.719
right anyway yeah enough with the

6384.179 --> 6386.719
counting already

6388.98 --> 6393.299999999999
yeah what okay

6390.96 --> 6395.34
look they could be going up I've had

6393.3 --> 6397.1990000000005
like over a hundred dislikes at some

6395.34 --> 6399.84
shows live and then they all just go

6397.199 --> 6402.48
away again doesn't really matter I can't

6399.84 --> 6405.3
see them right now so I'm I'm unable to

6402.48 --> 6407.879999999999
enjoy the fun of it I don't like that

6405.3 --> 6412.26
Google don't do that

6407.88 --> 6415.679
like if you want that as an option

6412.26 --> 6417.900000000001
for people to turn on or off on their

6415.679 --> 6420.96
channel do that

6417.9 --> 6424.099999999999
this ridiculous forcing system is

6420.96 --> 6424.1
completely pointless

6427.619 --> 6433.339999999999
wrenches can't see

6430.679 --> 6433.34
what

6433.86 --> 6436.159
what

6440.28 --> 6443.119
okay

6443.639 --> 6446.36
weird

6447.3 --> 6451.619000000001
that makes it even weirder right well

6450.36 --> 6455.159
whatever

6451.619 --> 6457.619
anyway I'm rounding out the show so yeah
