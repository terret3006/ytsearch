81.18 --> 86.10000000000001
still use the support so yeah I really

84.24 --> 88.46
hope to get some kind of donation today

86.1 --> 88.46
or

88.5 --> 92.9
I won't really be having a

93.24 --> 97.74
well I basically won't have any like

95.579 --> 99.41999999999999
Gusto energy drinks and Illuminati

97.74 --> 101.82
croissants

99.42 --> 103.86
over the weekend if I don't get any

101.82 --> 106.38
donations so that's what's at stake

103.86 --> 110.159
right now for me

106.38 --> 112.619
I mean I can't potentially do it without

110.159 --> 114.74000000000001
at least I have proper dinner and all

112.619 --> 118.92
that

114.74 --> 122.52
and enough smokes for a while

118.92 --> 125.0
right anyway yeah weather is totally

122.52 --> 125.0
cooking

126.18 --> 129.32
already sweating

129.899 --> 136.04
it's really hot

132.18 --> 136.04000000000002
really clear blue sky

137.64 --> 143.72
sun is still hitting this

140.819 --> 143.72
wall so

144.72 --> 150.2
that should probably change in around

146.879 --> 150.2
half an hour from now

152.16 --> 157.319
right Lance

154.56 --> 159.959
or they think it's this weather is great

157.319 --> 162.66
especially the mint is just

159.959 --> 165.36
really enjoying this I have to keep the

162.66 --> 169.099
planter plants plenty

165.36 --> 169.09900000000002
watered plenty though

170.22 --> 172.819
right

184.68 --> 187.28
huh

188.94 --> 193.98
hello Richard G first in chat

191.459 --> 195.9
it's you

193.98 --> 196.67999999999998
looks like a nice day over here yeah it

195.9 --> 199.76000000000002
is

196.68 --> 199.76000000000002
and so was yesterday

200.22 --> 204.599
I mean since what is it

202.8 --> 208.22
Monday

204.599 --> 208.22
that's it's been great weather

211.019 --> 218.76
right anyway it is Thursday the 7th of

215.099 --> 218.76
September 2023

219.12 --> 221.54
weather

223.68 --> 228.959
28 degrees Celsius right

226.92 --> 230.94
right and according to this it's it's

228.959 --> 233.04
pretty much going to be this this wet

230.94 --> 236.84
type of weather

233.04 --> 236.84
till Sunday

238.44 --> 243.659
and then supposedly

241.319 --> 246.659
on Tuesday it's going to cool down and

243.659 --> 249.26
it's going to be a thunderstorm-ish

246.659 --> 249.26
all right

249.72 --> 255.56
but still

251.34 --> 255.56
a lot of plenty of hot days ahead

257.78 --> 263.82
so please support me somehow

262.019 --> 267.18
did I get enough

263.82 --> 269.52
cool drinks like this and I'm gonna take

267.18 --> 272.52
a sip right now

269.52 --> 272.52
ah

274.52 --> 278.59999999999997
yeah fresh from the cooler

296.82 --> 301.44
right so yeah this first half hour might

299.1 --> 302.94
be a little flustered because it's just

301.44 --> 305.94
so hot in here

302.94 --> 308.479
but uh I'm sure we're gonna have fun I I

305.94 --> 308.479
feel good

308.639 --> 312.44
and uh cheers

330.36 --> 336.259
[Music]

332.66 --> 340.97900000000004
now I'm feeling really great actually

336.259 --> 343.62
since that Sunday the little party

340.979 --> 346.32
I just feel like I'm subtly connecting

343.62 --> 349.02
with people and then Darth came on the

346.32 --> 350.88
scene and well you've all seen it in the

349.02 --> 354.29999999999995
chat last two days

350.88 --> 356.699
we can't stop talking

354.3 --> 360.06
well I yeah I can actually I can just

356.699 --> 362.16
say okay I'm gonna stop talking now

360.06 --> 364.8
I'm glad that I'm able to do that

362.16 --> 367.38000000000005
because if I weren't able to do that we

364.8 --> 370.1
just end up like endlessly back and

367.38 --> 374.1
forthing for like eight hours in a row

370.1 --> 374.1
continually it's

374.699 --> 380.16
it's a bit Overkill in that sense

377.82 --> 383.52
but it's been so long since I found

380.16 --> 388.16
somebody that I could like do that with

383.52 --> 388.15999999999997
endless esoteric back and forths

391.08 --> 395.039
yeah

393.24 --> 397.199
right

395.039 --> 399.419
so yeah I feel great

397.199 --> 401.819
I feel more connected

399.419 --> 406.31899999999996
oh when Benjamin is back

401.819 --> 406.319
and he's also very energized

406.44 --> 411.08
from his bertaria Festival that went

408.84 --> 411.08
great

415.039 --> 422.88
this is like so positive like that's

418.88 --> 425.36
maybe it's the weather I don't know I

422.88 --> 425.36
got it too

432.9 --> 436.63899999999995
low LSG good to see you

442.139 --> 446.18
did you get any new cats

450.66 --> 453.44
all right

454.38 --> 460.5
I mean you got to be careful with it

456.72 --> 464.22
though like my old cat

460.5 --> 466.5
like she got pregnant when she was just

464.22 --> 471.12
one years old

466.5 --> 473.639
she was still like pretty young this is

471.12 --> 476.22
like that can happen

473.639 --> 477.72
even if you have a like a huge amount of

476.22 --> 478.86
little cats

477.72 --> 481.759
like

478.86 --> 485.539
you basically gotta like

481.759 --> 488.28000000000003
yeah hand them out quick

485.539 --> 490.8
otherwise like you'll have a cat

488.28 --> 494.0
explosion like in Dwarf Fortress you'll

490.8 --> 494.0
never be able to get rid of them

497.78 --> 503.21999999999997
yeah preacher's wide open you feel good

500.46 --> 506.039
I'm glad to hear that

503.22 --> 508.97900000000004
yeah I'm glad

506.039 --> 510.599
yeah with your with your dad all that

508.979 --> 513.68
just happening

510.599 --> 517.56
I'm glad it's not like this

513.68 --> 519.659
huge grieving weight that's like

517.56 --> 521.6999999999999
holding you down

519.659 --> 523.3199999999999
I mean you're probably feeling something

521.7 --> 527.0
but

523.32 --> 527.0
I'm glad you're still uh

527.88 --> 530.42
yeah

530.58 --> 535.64
it's weird in a way I had that too with

533.22 --> 535.64
my mother

536.459 --> 541.1999999999999
and it's it's weird because

539.16 --> 544.56
if you're not careful you can find

541.2 --> 544.5600000000001
yourself imposing

545.16 --> 549.899
on yourself that you have to feel bad or

548.339 --> 553.1600000000001
something right

549.899 --> 553.16
I disagree with that

561.72 --> 569.339
in my personal experience it's actually

564.6 --> 572.0600000000001
the dying phase that is the most painful

569.339 --> 572.0600000000001
and then

573.06 --> 580.26
like a funeral is like a goodbye

576.36 --> 583.16
but also if possible they let go and

580.26 --> 583.16
then relief

587.48 --> 591.1800000000001
I mean

589.26 --> 593.519
yeah

591.18 --> 595.62
it would be weird if you like did a

593.519 --> 598.7
little Freedom dance or anything at the

595.62 --> 598.7
end of the funeral but

600.66 --> 606.66
for me too with my mother it was like

602.82 --> 608.519
finally that's that's over with like I

606.66 --> 610.88
don't have to worry about my mother

608.519 --> 610.88
anymore

618.32 --> 623.6400000000001
right celebration of someone's life is

621.18 --> 625.56
how you look

623.64 --> 629.459
you like to look at it

625.56 --> 633.899
funeral Richard G yeah I totally agree

629.459 --> 636.899
although there sad feeling certainly

633.899 --> 639.6
but it shouldn't be it should just be

636.899 --> 643.86
there naturally right natural emotional

639.6 --> 645.779
moments it should be just emotional but

643.86 --> 648.24
not necessarily

645.779 --> 652.22
like grief and like how dare you not cry

648.24 --> 652.22
or something like no absolutely not

659.54 --> 665.579
like the funeral is there for the

664.019 --> 667.8
survivors

665.579 --> 670.3199999999999
it's a ritual

667.8 --> 672.7199999999999
to deal with something that's that

670.32 --> 675.5
shocking and impactful

672.72 --> 675.5
that's it

677.94 --> 684.3000000000001
and also to get a new bearing right why

681.899 --> 687.18
because all the people that were

684.3 --> 688.14
probably involved with the person that

687.18 --> 691.1999999999999
died

688.14 --> 693.42
are likely to come by during the funeral

691.2 --> 696.4200000000001
and then

693.42 --> 700.1999999999999
you can get like get a reading

696.42 --> 703.1999999999999
like how it's going to transform like

700.2 --> 705.72
like with my future of my mother we

703.2 --> 707.4590000000001
could already feel like wow everybody's

705.72 --> 709.5600000000001
going their separate way I could feel

707.459 --> 711.5999999999999
about it nobody said anything

709.56 --> 713.88
you could just see it on them and they

711.6 --> 716.1800000000001
did and like after my mother died it was

713.88 --> 716.18
just

717.019 --> 725.04
the family Spirit of like

721.92 --> 726.7199999999999
my mother and my aunt's family

725.04 --> 728.579
like

726.72 --> 731.399
it just

728.579 --> 734.459
it's scattered and I could feel that

731.399 --> 737.12
already during the funeral that that was

734.459 --> 737.1199999999999
happening

739.019 --> 744.92
and like it was a big surprise

742.38 --> 744.92
even

745.44 --> 750.48
because I always just assumed that that

748.2 --> 752.4590000000001
family Spirit was Immortal and that even

750.48 --> 754.62
if people would die that it would still

752.459 --> 757.6199999999999
hold strong but

754.62 --> 760.5600000000001
apparently it didn't

757.62 --> 765.139
apparently it was held together with a

760.56 --> 765.1389999999999
lot of effort and wouldn't naturally

765.18 --> 768.1389999999999
stay in place

769.279 --> 774.42
but yeah if you always been in such a

772.26 --> 777.26
thing then you don't know that until it

774.42 --> 777.26
suddenly stops

779.24 --> 783.38
hey Alice let's see you

786.42 --> 792.959
how to play shanties

790.16 --> 795.56
melodium huh

792.959 --> 795.56
cool

803.16 --> 808.1999999999999
yeah

804.66 --> 810.42
I'm gonna Google search it it too

808.2 --> 812.6
right here G I don't know what they look

810.42 --> 812.5999999999999
like

814.139 --> 816.74
oh

823.22 --> 827.36
like a keyboard

829.44 --> 831.86
what

838.5 --> 841.76
it's a keyboard

845.42 --> 850.76
that's what it looked like what does it

847.92 --> 850.76
do exactly

850.86 --> 856.5790000000001
let me Wikipedia I think that Wikipedia

854.519 --> 860.399
sufficiently

856.579 --> 864.4399999999999
reliable for something like this

860.399 --> 864.44
an accordion organ

866.519 --> 872.54
type of button accordion right so it's a

870.18 --> 875.899
keyboard that's it's like an electronic

872.54 --> 875.899
accordion then

877.26 --> 880.7
or is it just an accordion

880.74 --> 886.98
okay send me yeah sure or a picture

885.18 --> 892.6389999999999
because when I Googled it I just got

886.98 --> 892.639
these well keyboards keyboards on a Wire

894.779 --> 898.04
that's what they look like

900.24 --> 905.16
but if it's basically a keyboard

902.22 --> 907.019
accordion then it makes sense

905.16 --> 909.199
that it has that wire on it and

907.019 --> 909.199
everything

920.44 --> 923.5390000000001
[Music]

925.38 --> 928.04
all right

934.459 --> 939.66
that's such a by the way that's such a

937.459 --> 943.0999999999999
fisherman's Pub

939.66 --> 943.1
instrument by the way

950.519 --> 952.76
foreign

964.699 --> 969.4799999999999
I think those instruments are also very

967.44 --> 973.0400000000001
popular in a lot of Eastern European

969.48 --> 973.04
countries and Russia

987.24 --> 991.6800000000001
I don't know maybe I'm wrong

989.76 --> 993.92
I always thought that Eastern Europe was

991.68 --> 993.92
like

995.519 --> 1000.279
those types of instruments

1001.579 --> 1004.06
right

1005.18 --> 1008.779
okay video

1010.699 --> 1015.579
oh right it's not it's it's just uh

1016.04 --> 1024.199
a harmonium it's not a keyboard it's

1018.259 --> 1024.199
it's just an actual airbag based

1024.799 --> 1027.76
harmonium

1028.699 --> 1034.52
I don't know what they

1031.3 --> 1034.52
[Applause]

1039.4 --> 1043.8190000000002
yeah

1041.059 --> 1045.26
right we call that

1043.819 --> 1049.04
uh

1045.26 --> 1053.179
a house organ basically that's

1049.04 --> 1055.46
house or hokabur or home so a room or

1053.179 --> 1057.14
house organ

1055.46 --> 1060.38
is what

1057.14 --> 1062.74
it's like how the word is constructed in

1060.38 --> 1062.74
Dutch

1062.78 --> 1065.62
interesting

1074.84 --> 1081.3999999999999
but I think that the Dutch probably also

1078.08 --> 1081.3999999999999
just call it a harmonium

1082.039 --> 1087.98
we we've we got words for things but

1085.28 --> 1089.24
then end up using like the English word

1087.98 --> 1092.299
for it

1089.24 --> 1093.6200000000001
it's a typical Dutch issue always has

1092.299 --> 1097.22
been by the way

1093.62 --> 1100.6999999999998
because it's just we tend to like Graft

1097.22 --> 1103.22
in English because of media

1100.7 --> 1105.94
because of a lot of exposure to English

1103.22 --> 1105.94
in Media

1106.16 --> 1111.919
it's something that's that's always

1108.08 --> 1113.78
happened like as far as I can remember

1111.919 --> 1115.46
in my life

1113.78 --> 1117.7
that people would do that including

1115.46 --> 1117.7
myself

1121.179 --> 1126.919
oh cool

1123.86 --> 1130.78
it was really good at it was he awesome

1126.919 --> 1130.7800000000002
hey love fruit good to see you

1141.02 --> 1146.059
right man I was just thinking

1144.919 --> 1149.419
it's like

1146.059 --> 1152.12
oh and Benjamin's dream with like what

1149.419 --> 1154.8200000000002
this little Festival has been at I mean

1152.12 --> 1156.7399999999998
it's like it's inspired him so it

1154.82 --> 1159.02
enormously that like

1156.74 --> 1162.08
it's made me start to fantasize like

1159.02 --> 1166.0
what if one day

1162.08 --> 1166.0
somehow I could like

1166.28 --> 1170.26
get us I don't know

1171.38 --> 1179.8600000000001
what the hell would you even call it

1175.16 --> 1182.96
a meeting of the early bird show like

1179.86 --> 1185.539
where all of us guys are whoever is

1182.96 --> 1188.66
typically would like to but like that

1185.539 --> 1190.36
we'd have a meet up somewhere but God

1188.66 --> 1193.52
how do we do that

1190.36 --> 1195.559
I mean if I'd be expecting all of you to

1193.52 --> 1197.24
come to the Netherlands I think that

1195.559 --> 1198.6399999999999
might be kind of tough since you could

1197.24 --> 1203.66
barely

1198.64 --> 1205.2800000000002
support me anyway so yeah it's just a

1203.66 --> 1207.26
dream but I was just thinking like what

1205.28 --> 1210.44
that would that be like

1207.26 --> 1213.44
if the guys that like to hang around in

1210.44 --> 1216.8200000000002
my chat if we would actually be there

1213.44 --> 1216.8200000000002
physically in some place

1217.7 --> 1221.26
like what would we be doing

1228.02 --> 1233.66
well I know that it's gonna be like

1231.44 --> 1237.799
I know things that I would love to do

1233.66 --> 1240.0800000000002
right like a mandatory thing for such a

1237.799 --> 1242.72
meet up would be

1240.08 --> 1246.039
campfire

1242.72 --> 1249.679
and I I am going to do the fight

1246.039 --> 1253.039
I will and I'm gonna show off my

1249.679 --> 1255.919
my skill and even show like how you can

1253.039 --> 1259.64
with enough effort like Build A Smith

1255.919 --> 1262.7800000000002
out of just a basic wood fire

1259.64 --> 1262.7800000000002
enough to like

1262.82 --> 1269.5
yeah like an improvised Fork like I

1266.9 --> 1269.5
can't do that

1272.84 --> 1277.9599999999998
and I don't know

1274.7 --> 1277.96
I'm just dreaming

1283.78 --> 1287.98
hey five roads get to you

1305.179 --> 1310.7800000000002
I'm just trying to think of like what

1307.58 --> 1310.78
what will we be doing

1316.039 --> 1320.36
love to go to an early bird meet up yeah

1318.32 --> 1322.9399999999998
yeah

1320.36 --> 1326.059
but I'm still thinking like

1322.94 --> 1329.539
would have like what what would be like

1326.059 --> 1331.8799999999999
what would really make it worth it

1329.539 --> 1333.799
because it's gonna have expenses and all

1331.88 --> 1336.6200000000001
that and what would act like what would

1333.799 --> 1339.5
you do that we couldn't just do like

1336.62 --> 1342.8799999999999
talking online which is basically free

1339.5 --> 1342.88
all you need is time

1343.52 --> 1348.7
right

1345.14 --> 1348.7
but anyway it's just

1349.179 --> 1354.44
it's still kind of bubbling in The

1352.22 --> 1357.5
Cauldron it's not there's nothing really

1354.44 --> 1359.8400000000001
solid there yet except for the

1357.5 --> 1362.84
the campfire that's that's a must be

1359.84 --> 1365.4189999999999
like that's something I I just want to

1362.84 --> 1369.8799999999999
do in general but that would definitely

1365.419 --> 1369.88
be a part in such a day somewhere

1370.88 --> 1374.3600000000001
I wonder if Moxie or others would show

1373.039 --> 1378.26
up

1374.36 --> 1380.299
that would be really weird us that would

1378.26 --> 1383.14
actually be really weird

1380.299 --> 1386.6
but

1383.14 --> 1389.8400000000001
interesting in ways

1386.6 --> 1391.28
I I think that a whole bunch of trolls

1389.84 --> 1394.34
could

1391.28 --> 1395.24
buy bizarre happenstance choose to show

1394.34 --> 1398.78
up

1395.24 --> 1401.2
and I think that they'd actually be very

1398.78 --> 1401.2
different

1402.14 --> 1405.919
from like how they are in the chat

1404.659 --> 1410.2600000000002
drawing

1405.919 --> 1410.26
because suddenly we're physically there

1414.14 --> 1418.8200000000002
right so they might still have the

1416.419 --> 1421.46
impulse they're like but then they're

1418.82 --> 1425.4189999999999
like oh wait I'm actually physically

1421.46 --> 1427.039
here I should probably not do that we're

1425.419 --> 1431.14
probably gonna have that kind of thing

1427.039 --> 1431.14
like they're trying to hold back a lot

1431.84 --> 1438.32
because if they didn't people would

1435.08 --> 1440.26
start growling or at least I might start

1438.32 --> 1443.329
grounding

1440.26 --> 1443.329
[Music]

1446.059 --> 1451.34
they're liked it I would be like

1448.76 --> 1454.299
babysitting hmm

1451.34 --> 1454.299
yeah fair enough

1459.26 --> 1463.94
I guess that well if it would be like a

1461.659 --> 1465.38
family event type thing like Owen

1463.94 --> 1469.039
Benjamin has done

1465.38 --> 1473.179
well it's gonna have yeah I think that

1469.039 --> 1475.039
it would be kept relatively simple then

1473.179 --> 1477.919
right because you're gonna have to have

1475.039 --> 1480.14
to spend some time on entertaining the

1477.919 --> 1484.8400000000001
kids keeping them busy enough so they

1480.14 --> 1484.8400000000001
don't get up to new Good by accident

1485.559 --> 1492.1
and like organizing lunch

1489.26 --> 1492.1
and dinner

1494.0 --> 1501.039
and yeah I mean I think that would

1496.88 --> 1504.6200000000001
probably already do it and then maybe

1501.039 --> 1506.9
hmm how about this if there's gonna be

1504.62 --> 1509.8999999999999
kids and all that then maybe you could

1506.9 --> 1512.48
have like the campfire

1509.9 --> 1514.46
situation make a whole event out of it

1512.48 --> 1517.52
and basically do like a storytelling

1514.46 --> 1519.679
thing with like everybody there

1517.52 --> 1522.3799999999999
and it's like

1519.679 --> 1525.44
yeah people that have interesting

1522.38 --> 1528.0200000000002
stories that are like family friendly

1525.44 --> 1529.159
it's very important that they do that

1528.02 --> 1531.799
right

1529.159 --> 1533.779
until the late hours and then all the

1531.799 --> 1536.539
kids have to go to bed

1533.779 --> 1539.08
and then the serious [ __ ]

1536.539 --> 1539.08
right

1540.44 --> 1545.96
then we can like

1543.14 --> 1548.0590000000002
basically let go of those

1545.96 --> 1549.679
children are present restraints for a

1548.059 --> 1553.6399999999999
bit and

1549.679 --> 1556.88
yeah go on for yeah however long is

1553.64 --> 1559.159
sensible can't be too late

1556.88 --> 1560.96
or probably be a bunch of mothers that

1559.159 --> 1563.779
go to bed earlier

1560.96 --> 1566.24
I don't know that's kind of sort of what

1563.779 --> 1568.159
I'm thinking of like oh that would be so

1566.24 --> 1571.1
great and that would it's so funny

1568.159 --> 1573.0200000000002
because that's technically what my

1571.1 --> 1575.299
family did

1573.02 --> 1577.76
my mother and my aunt's family when they

1575.299 --> 1578.779
got together during Springtime in my

1577.76 --> 1582.559
mother's

1578.779 --> 1582.559
Old Farm freezeland

1583.039 --> 1589.0
we did just that we did a bunch of

1585.32 --> 1593.539
garden work just organizing breakfast

1589.0 --> 1597.76
lunch and dinner and fireplace and

1593.539 --> 1597.76
sometimes a fire outside and just

1598.64 --> 1604.8200000000002
kids being up to no good

1600.82 --> 1608.559
that too but it was mostly like going

1604.82 --> 1608.559
out in the wilderness in like

1608.6 --> 1614.539
make little huts and create path in in a

1612.5 --> 1617.72
nettle field and all that it's very

1614.539 --> 1619.1589999999999
exciting it's some it seems potentially

1617.72 --> 1621.02
dangerous and it makes it all very

1619.159 --> 1622.7600000000002
exciting so that's what we would be

1621.02 --> 1626.3799999999999
doing then

1622.76 --> 1626.3799999999999
and I guess I really miss it

1636.32 --> 1643.1589999999999
I bet all of the family misses that

1640.7 --> 1645.2
my brother and my nephews because that

1643.159 --> 1646.5200000000002
was like a really magical time every

1645.2 --> 1648.14
time that was

1646.52 --> 1650.779
that that would happen it would always

1648.14 --> 1651.5
be amazing memories that would stick to

1650.779 --> 1654.1
you

1651.5 --> 1654.1
with everybody

1654.26 --> 1658.94
like

1656.539 --> 1663.5
I will never forget how things got

1658.94 --> 1667.8200000000002
really silly like I was still like 12 or

1663.5 --> 1670.82
something my brother was 19 I think

1667.82 --> 1675.02
and he was like really into engineering

1670.82 --> 1676.9399999999998
and engines and [ __ ] and then

1675.02 --> 1680.62
the guy

1676.94 --> 1683.48
it had this old lawnmower

1680.62 --> 1686.12
and then they took the engine from the

1683.48 --> 1688.64
lawnmower and basically strapped it to

1686.12 --> 1690.799
the little kid's bike that was now

1688.64 --> 1696.26
lawnmower power

1690.799 --> 1700.22
it was so crazy but so freaking amazing

1696.26 --> 1702.679
as a little boy to do that sort of [ __ ]

1700.22 --> 1705.76
really dangerous too

1702.679 --> 1705.76
but ugh

1707.059 --> 1712.46
and our parents like they didn't really

1710.0 --> 1714.799
punish us for that

1712.46 --> 1717.02
and we almost did it like secretly like

1714.799 --> 1718.8799999999999
it would just do that [ __ ] parents

1717.02 --> 1721.7
wouldn't really know what we were up to

1718.88 --> 1725.419
and then like move slightly away from

1721.7 --> 1727.46
the farm and then do that [ __ ]

1725.419 --> 1729.7990000000002
and then our parents wouldn't really

1727.46 --> 1731.179
catch on to it so they wouldn't get like

1729.799 --> 1733.72
what are you doing that's super

1731.179 --> 1733.72
dangerous

1734.12 --> 1736.779
oh

1736.82 --> 1743.6
I bet that was a wreath laugh yeah yeah

1740.72 --> 1745.039
but sometimes people did get hurt though

1743.6 --> 1748.279
[Music]

1745.039 --> 1751.22
I mean no deadly crashes or anything

1748.279 --> 1753.08
thank God but

1751.22 --> 1754.88
I mean people did get hurt there

1753.08 --> 1757.279
sometimes because of but that's just

1754.88 --> 1760.0
natural Hazard nothing super serious

1757.279 --> 1762.62
nothing like

1760.0 --> 1765.44
mutilating or anything

1762.62 --> 1768.1999999999998
but I like got this scar still here on

1765.44 --> 1771.14
my finger because one time I tried to

1768.2 --> 1775.039
pull a reed out of the ground

1771.14 --> 1776.96
but then it didn't and I basically just

1775.039 --> 1779.419
sliced that up I'll never forget that

1776.96 --> 1781.659
that's the last time I'll ever try to do

1779.419 --> 1781.659
that

1782.36 --> 1784.9599999999998
and

1787.76 --> 1790.72
what was it

1794.0 --> 1800.659
I think like there was one time like a

1796.88 --> 1804.46
motorcycle crash oh uh scoot mobile is

1800.659 --> 1804.46
like a small it's not a

1805.1 --> 1810.799
another Highway motorcycle right what do

1808.039 --> 1813.3799999999999
you yeah scooter

1810.799 --> 1816.1399999999999
that sort of thing it was never really

1813.38 --> 1818.659
like oh my God

1816.14 --> 1823.779
like a friend of mine

1818.659 --> 1826.22
one time like we had this uh

1823.779 --> 1827.659
paragliding thing no what did you call

1826.22 --> 1830.8990000000001
that with the

1827.659 --> 1833.6000000000001
with the wheel on a rope with a hook on

1830.899 --> 1835.6999999999998
it basically and just

1833.6 --> 1838.52
the thing like that

1835.7 --> 1840.6200000000001
what the [ __ ] do you call that again

1838.52 --> 1841.58
yeah I don't even know how to call it in

1840.62 --> 1844.58
Dutch

1841.58 --> 1848.6
that thing doing like wee

1844.58 --> 1851.1789999999999
on a rope zip line right that and we

1848.6 --> 1855.9189999999999
basically built one ourselves improvised

1851.179 --> 1858.3200000000002
but it was not super safe and one time

1855.919 --> 1861.44
yeah one of my friends basically did

1858.32 --> 1863.779
that and then like it got stuck and he

1861.44 --> 1866.659
fell from like unexpectedly from like

1863.779 --> 1869.96
three meters high right on his back

1866.659 --> 1873.94
and then he had like this bruised rib

1869.96 --> 1873.94
like that sort of [ __ ] would happen

1877.399 --> 1882.7399999999998
I think my brother almost like caught

1879.799 --> 1885.559
his own toe off one time with an ax when

1882.74 --> 1889.22
he was cutting wood

1885.559 --> 1891.5
but nothing like really permanent

1889.22 --> 1894.919
in retrospect a bit of a miracle but hey

1891.5 --> 1898.52
it was just it's so natural

1894.919 --> 1900.38
and we did all learn from that though it

1898.52 --> 1902.539
wasn't like some idiot would just keep

1900.38 --> 1905.5390000000002
doing the same mistakes until they got

1902.539 --> 1907.399
themselves killed we were all learning

1905.539 --> 1909.86
from that [ __ ]

1907.399 --> 1911.6
anyway

1909.86 --> 1913.7199999999998
are you seeking star water good to see

1911.6 --> 1913.7199999999998
you

1915.02 --> 1918.46
logical observations

1919.88 --> 1927.44
do you know Harlem well no not well but

1923.48 --> 1930.2
I have been there it's an interesting

1927.44 --> 1933.52
very beautiful place and there's some

1930.2 --> 1933.52
old ruins there too

1941.059 --> 1946.7
they grow up on the second set of

1943.52 --> 1951.02
Jackass no we were just kids

1946.7 --> 1954.26
I mean dude we were doing that [ __ ]

1951.02 --> 1956.48
when jackass didn't even exist

1954.26 --> 1959.24
and we didn't do it to get ourselves

1956.48 --> 1961.22
hurt to be idiots it it would just

1959.24 --> 1964.22
happen by accident

1961.22 --> 1965.539
we would just like do whatever we were

1964.22 --> 1969.38
thinking of

1965.539 --> 1972.46
with very little risk

1969.38 --> 1972.46
risk assessment

1972.799 --> 1978.08
and we because we were all boys and we

1975.86 --> 1980.899
would also like huh I could just do that

1978.08 --> 1983.4189999999999
to brag and [ __ ] right so it was gonna

1980.899 --> 1985.34
happen anyway but we didn't do it to get

1983.419 --> 1988.179
her to widget doing it to show off how

1985.34 --> 1988.1789999999999
badass we were

1989.539 --> 1993.559
to each other

1991.52 --> 1996.1
and because it's just exciting and

1993.559 --> 1996.1
adventurous

2020.74 --> 2024.7
by the way one of the weirdest

2022.779 --> 2027.7
Sensations ever

2024.7 --> 2032.26
that I cannot explain still to this day

2027.7 --> 2035.8600000000001
is how unbelievably addicting

2032.26 --> 2038.86
playing Commodore 64 games was

2035.86 --> 2040.84
on that television that was there in

2038.86 --> 2043.6589999999999
like my grandmother's

2040.84 --> 2046.4189999999999
the grandmother's part of the house

2043.659 --> 2049.179
that's like her

2046.419 --> 2051.76
the place that she slept at that was

2049.179 --> 2054.419
like her living I mean that farm thing

2051.76 --> 2058.179
was huge

2054.419 --> 2060.359
huge biggest house that I've ever slept

2058.179 --> 2060.359
in

2061.54 --> 2068.98
it was like an Old Farm pretty big

2064.44 --> 2071.859
transformed into sort of a

2068.98 --> 2074.22
sleeping accommodation type house with a

2071.859 --> 2076.839
lot of bedrooms everywhere

2074.22 --> 2080.6389999999997
improvised mini Hotel

2076.839 --> 2080.639
but with not a lot of facilities

2080.82 --> 2087.04
barely functioning toilets

2084.28 --> 2088.7200000000003
was a lot of issues

2087.04 --> 2091.48
but

2088.72 --> 2094.2999999999997
yeah I just remember like playing

2091.48 --> 2097.18
certain games in that room

2094.3 --> 2098.44
and it was so surreal

2097.18 --> 2102.46
like

2098.44 --> 2107.02
I can't explain how magical that felt

2102.46 --> 2111.16
especially because it felt magical there

2107.02 --> 2114.52
and much less in comparison to say at

2111.16 --> 2116.92
home playing video games it was so weird

2114.52 --> 2119.2599999999998
like also that I remember feeling like

2116.92 --> 2120.46
why what was in the air that made it

2119.26 --> 2122.7400000000002
just like

2120.46 --> 2125.14
whoa

2122.74 --> 2126.9599999999996
like playing the same video games and

2125.14 --> 2130.92
doing it there was like

2126.96 --> 2130.92
I don't know what that was

2131.98 --> 2138.54
so bizarre

2134.44 --> 2138.54
and I wasn't the only one that had that

2138.7 --> 2142.72
there was just something there some

2140.5 --> 2144.28
energy there

2142.72 --> 2146.4399999999996
and it it

2144.28 --> 2148.98
influenced

2146.44 --> 2148.98
it

2151.24 --> 2156.04
right but they did not like the family

2153.28 --> 2157.8390000000004
did not like playing video games there

2156.04 --> 2160.3
So eventually

2157.839 --> 2162.16
they they didn't like that the kids

2160.3 --> 2164.94
would be doing that it's like no you

2162.16 --> 2164.94
have to get outside

2166.3 --> 2170.1400000000003
it was a bit of a problem but I just

2168.579 --> 2172.1800000000003
remember that it's like there's

2170.14 --> 2175.48
something really magical about playing

2172.18 --> 2178.2999999999997
video games there and I could I I wasn't

2175.48 --> 2180.579
even able to like explain it

2178.3 --> 2181.599
it's just parents just like oh they're

2180.579 --> 2183.1600000000003
addicted

2181.599 --> 2186.28
but I mean

2183.16 --> 2188.68
it was there like we would go home and

2186.28 --> 2191.1400000000003
then I wouldn't play video games I would

2188.68 --> 2193.54
be like just sucks playing video games

2191.14 --> 2194.98
here it really it's just so bizarre

2193.54 --> 2196.72
really now that I think that I'm

2194.98 --> 2198.579
thinking back to it

2196.72 --> 2199.48
that was really what it was like I don't

2198.579 --> 2202.7200000000003
get it

2199.48 --> 2205.72
why was it so cool to do it there

2202.72 --> 2210.359
and not at home it's the same video

2205.72 --> 2210.359
games literally the same ones

2211.24 --> 2216.8799999999997
the same computer that would be taken

2214.72 --> 2219.52
with us

2216.88 --> 2222.2200000000003
and then taken back and like why was it

2219.52 --> 2225.18
so cool to play there and not home

2222.22 --> 2225.18
I don't get it

2228.04 --> 2233.8
yeah yeah Google virus it wasn't that

2231.64 --> 2236.14
interesting

2233.8 --> 2238.2400000000002
I'm not gonna talk about video games I

2236.14 --> 2239.44
didn't want to talk about video games I

2238.24 --> 2241.24
just

2239.44 --> 2244.359
realized that there was something

2241.24 --> 2246.339
magical about it there and that's the

2244.359 --> 2248.44
interesting Parts like

2246.339 --> 2252.2799999999997
playing the video games there and being

2248.44 --> 2254.44
like wow this is so awesome and then

2252.28 --> 2257.02
going home playing the same video games

2254.44 --> 2261.339
and then

2257.02 --> 2264.3
it's not cool like what the [ __ ] is that

2261.339 --> 2264.2999999999997
why

2265.15 --> 2271.369
[Music]

2281.98 --> 2284.98
okay

2288.16 --> 2295.2
that seems awfully random is that robot

2292.06 --> 2295.2
commenter again

2295.9 --> 2301.839
September 7th 2023 yeah that's robot

2299.32 --> 2305.7400000000002
common turkey bye

2301.839 --> 2308.099
bye robot with nonsense story out of

2305.74 --> 2308.0989999999997
nowhere

2308.339 --> 2312.18
I'll see you next time

2320.73 --> 2324.82
[Music]

2322.38 --> 2326.56
am I right or what

2324.82 --> 2329.98
it's always the same it's like this

2326.56 --> 2333.2799999999997
robot that just does that

2329.98 --> 2335.68
it really is it's like a story that's

2333.28 --> 2337.8390000000004
barely go like what's the point of that

2335.68 --> 2340.2999999999997
and has nothing to do with anything

2337.839 --> 2342.88
we're talking about

2340.3 --> 2346.0
like in no way

2342.88 --> 2348.339
this is like perhaps roughly the same

2346.0 --> 2352.68
category

2348.339 --> 2352.68
what just very vague

2352.78 --> 2359.02
a person would never respond to what I'm

2355.72 --> 2360.64
doing even if they just got to know me

2359.02 --> 2364.0
they would never respond with something

2360.64 --> 2365.92
like that only a bot

2364.0 --> 2369.18
does that

2365.92 --> 2369.1800000000003
that's how I know

2373.42 --> 2377.92
right

2374.44 --> 2379.839
and just for the record for people that

2377.92 --> 2383.52
are listening I will just read out now

2379.839 --> 2383.52
exactly what he said

2384.52 --> 2391.24
so that you know on record like yeah

2389.26 --> 2392.5
so this is what he was saying in the

2391.24 --> 2394.1189999999997
middle of everything talk about the

2392.5 --> 2396.72
gaming and all that

2394.119 --> 2402.82
he just comes in there

2396.72 --> 2407.74
hwti I remember some once I was in a van

2402.82 --> 2411.4
dot the engine overheated Dot and one of

2407.74 --> 2413.7999999999997
the other passengers dot talk the

2411.4 --> 2417.2200000000003
radiator cap off Dot

2413.8 --> 2420.96
while the engine was still hot Dot and

2417.22 --> 2420.9599999999996
the cap hit him on the head

2424.54 --> 2432.18
and he fell out the door he was okay

2427.68 --> 2432.18
like is that how a person

2434.46 --> 2440.5
describe something that he remembers

2438.22 --> 2443.6189999999997
no

2440.5 --> 2445.18
that's a robot

2443.619 --> 2449.94
drag this

2445.18 --> 2449.94
cough up stuff from a database

2449.98 --> 2454.48
there's no cohesion just instantaneously

2453.28 --> 2457.8
you know

2454.48 --> 2457.8
or I do at least

2466.48 --> 2470.079
most attractive thing about Owen is

2468.579 --> 2472.0600000000004
doing

2470.079 --> 2474.28
it's the building aspect yeah yeah Alice

2472.06 --> 2477.06
yeah

2474.28 --> 2477.0600000000004
ah

2481.98 --> 2487.26
well one thing that would be kind of

2484.18 --> 2487.2599999999998
cool maybe

2487.48 --> 2491.8
is with the early bird guys if we all

2489.76 --> 2494.0200000000004
had some kind of

2491.8 --> 2495.76
plant growing tradition and the one

2494.02 --> 2500.22
thing that we could do with the Meetup

2495.76 --> 2500.2200000000003
is basically exchange seeds

2501.579 --> 2506.5
that sort of thing

2503.5 --> 2512.52
or even like exchange plots like oh look

2506.5 --> 2512.52
I got a couple of these who wants one

2515.02 --> 2517.68
all right

2519.4 --> 2525.339
like a plant trading thing

2522.4 --> 2526.599
birds love seeds right yeah but not for

2525.339 --> 2529.859
eating though

2526.599 --> 2529.8590000000004
for planting

2544.72 --> 2550.8999999999996
this Earth stationary

2548.16 --> 2552.8199999999997
extraordinary claim the stationary

2550.9 --> 2555.04
ursulas

2552.82 --> 2557.079
how dare you

2555.04 --> 2559.56
how dare you claim the Earth is

2557.079 --> 2559.5600000000004
stationary

2559.78 --> 2563.46
it's moving

2564.82 --> 2570.2400000000002
was that a good impression of flat soy

2567.04 --> 2570.24
doing an impression of Dell

2593.26 --> 2598.0
or kitten we need to switch one

2596.02 --> 2601.42
that's cute well I think that if we're

2598.0 --> 2603.28
gonna do some Meetup for plant trade I

2601.42 --> 2605.26
I'm afraid that if you want to do

2603.28 --> 2608.92
anything kind of weed related you're

2605.26 --> 2612.5200000000004
gonna have to stick to seeds and hey

2608.92 --> 2615.7200000000003
to be fair guys I got huge amount of

2612.52 --> 2618.4
original seeds

2615.72 --> 2620.3799999999997
that I don't really know what to do with

2618.4 --> 2622.1800000000003
and I don't know it might be that a lot

2620.38 --> 2624.339
of them are not really fertile anymore

2622.18 --> 2627.16
because they're kind of old

2624.339 --> 2628.06
but some will I'll just give them to you

2627.16 --> 2631.2599999999998
guys

2628.06 --> 2631.2599999999998
whoever wants them

2638.079 --> 2642.28
Rome

2639.579 --> 2645.2200000000003
the wheat from the coffee shop too and

2642.28 --> 2648.1600000000003
that was like good weed and then it some

2645.22 --> 2650.0789999999997
of it did accidentally have seeds it's

2648.16 --> 2652.0
kind of funny because when I like oh I

2650.079 --> 2654.2400000000002
got a seat here they usually like give

2652.0 --> 2654.24
me

2654.52 --> 2659.52
like compensation for that

2657.46 --> 2663.359
pretty Epic

2659.52 --> 2668.46
but I get this peep to see too so yeah

2663.359 --> 2668.46
cannabis seeds I got plenty of those

2668.68 --> 2673.96
I got cannabis seeds a huge amount that

2671.38 --> 2677.56
were originally from the our garden

2673.96 --> 2680.2
planting of cannabis in my old

2677.56 --> 2682.66
mother's home in the garden

2680.2 --> 2685.1189999999997
because I used to do that and well we

2682.66 --> 2688.1189999999997
did not we were not properly able to

2685.119 --> 2688.119
prevent

2688.5 --> 2694.3
pollination so there were a lot of seeds

2691.78 --> 2697.6600000000003
around and I collected them

2694.3 --> 2701.619
God like this box full of it

2697.66 --> 2705.06
of old strains right old unmanipulated

2701.619 --> 2705.06
strains from the 90s

2708.76 --> 2713.92
very tasty type of wheat

2711.339 --> 2715.359
not super strong but you like real you

2713.92 --> 2718.96
felt that

2715.359 --> 2721.68
you felt the the greenness

2718.96 --> 2721.68
of it

2721.72 --> 2729.339
right so in some Meetup I'll definitely

2724.92 --> 2732.54
hand out some of some seeds

2729.339 --> 2732.54
to those who want it

2734.68 --> 2739.64
[Music]

2751.359 --> 2757.92
you don't know how good seeds are good

2755.14 --> 2757.92
for what

2772.0 --> 2779.2
have to ever seen tree bending pictures

2777.339 --> 2782.04
what

2779.2 --> 2782.04
does that mean

2782.859 --> 2788.2
how long they are good for uh well

2785.92 --> 2791.98
technically akumo virus they should be

2788.2 --> 2795.3999999999996
good potentially forever but

2791.98 --> 2796.72
it's like some seeds just die off after

2795.4 --> 2799.48
a while

2796.72 --> 2802.06
because they had like a micro fungus or

2799.48 --> 2804.579
something in them and it just yeah that

2802.06 --> 2808.44
eats them while they're in seed form and

2804.579 --> 2808.44
others will literally stay good forever

2816.76 --> 2821.3190000000004
right there's only one way to find out

2819.04 --> 2825.54
and that is to just plant a bunch and

2821.319 --> 2825.54
then see how how well they've held up

2832.0 --> 2837.64
keep the dry and dark

2834.339 --> 2840.52
yeah well I got them I basically the

2837.64 --> 2843.16
seeds I find I put them in typical

2840.52 --> 2846.88
cannabis plastic bags

2843.16 --> 2848.98
and like vacuum yeah keep the air out

2846.88 --> 2852.599
and then that well they're gonna stay

2848.98 --> 2852.599
like that good forever

2872.56 --> 2875.64
right anyhow

2881.76 --> 2886.8390000000004
it's kind of funny yesterday my show

2884.38 --> 2888.6400000000003
title yesterday like really triggered a

2886.839 --> 2891.64
bunch of people

2888.64 --> 2894.7
how what you really think Indiana Jones

2891.64 --> 2898.06
was good bro

2894.7 --> 2901.2999999999997
that just goes to show the valuable your

2898.06 --> 2902.859
opinion is like that [ __ ] it's like

2901.3 --> 2904.7200000000003
wow

2902.859 --> 2906.819
and the funny thing is I knew it was

2904.72 --> 2909.4599999999996
gonna happen because I said it

2906.819 --> 2913.0
I put there on purpose it's like yeah

2909.46 --> 2915.28
everybody's gonna say it's bad

2913.0 --> 2918.4
but I honestly didn't think it was that

2915.28 --> 2920.619
bad I mean yeah it wasn't good it's it's

2918.4 --> 2924.28
not the old thing

2920.619 --> 2927.1600000000003
but at least like it felt like a proper

2924.28 --> 2929.92
Indiana Jones movie and not like a

2927.16 --> 2932.52
cartoonish version of it like the

2929.92 --> 2932.52
Crystal Skull

2936.52 --> 2942.16
but it was not perfect

2939.339 --> 2944.7999999999997
the plot line seemed in red like

2942.16 --> 2947.68
afterward it seemed a bit broken but it

2944.8 --> 2950.1400000000003
was still just very Indiana Jones style

2947.68 --> 2952.4199999999996
adventurous and there were some good

2950.14 --> 2955.24
funny moments

2952.42 --> 2957.64
that were not like oh we're trying to be

2955.24 --> 2959.859
funny but like no it is really funny

2957.64 --> 2962.68
like unexpectedly and that's like

2959.859 --> 2964.72
perfect Indiana Jones humor

2962.68 --> 2966.64
when the the funniness is like

2964.72 --> 2970.66
unexpected

2966.64 --> 2975.1189999999997
what works and they they manage that

2970.66 --> 2975.1189999999997
so I'm just like no I like this one

2976.0 --> 2979.3
and I mean

2978.04 --> 2982.2
uh

2979.3 --> 2982.2000000000003
just point it further

2982.42 --> 2988.56
but I'm pretty damn sure they listened

2985.78 --> 2988.5600000000004
to the criticism

2989.2 --> 2993.16
of the Crystal Skull for this one they

2991.42 --> 2994.9
absolutely did listen

2993.16 --> 2997.2999999999997
to the critics

2994.9 --> 2999.4
the ones that actually matter and not

2997.3 --> 3002.2400000000002
the the whiny screamy

2999.4 --> 3002.2400000000002
gammas

3004.079 --> 3010.7000000000003
or dark ash what loved ones I don't know

3008.4 --> 3010.7000000000003
you

3027.96 --> 3031.88
but hello I guess

3034.26 --> 3036.3190000000004
um

3050.04 --> 3057.68
right if yeah if you have that option

3054.0 --> 3057.68
my seeds are not like that

3058.859 --> 3064.68
I mean it's all natural I didn't do

3061.8 --> 3069.059
anything chemical or anything it's just

3064.68 --> 3072.24
seeds came out I collected them

3069.059 --> 3073.2000000000003
it wasn't the intention for seeds to

3072.24 --> 3075.4799999999996
come out

3073.2 --> 3078.4199999999996
I think a lot of those seas are actually

3075.48 --> 3080.9
hermaphroditic

3078.42 --> 3080.9
even

3083.18 --> 3089.94
the Earth does not work without

3086.48 --> 3092.94
involging by magical forces

3089.94 --> 3099.26
okay RJC

3092.94 --> 3102.359
okay except yeah an upward moving Earth

3099.26 --> 3104.8390000000004
definitely requires some kind of

3102.359 --> 3109.02
mysterious Force to

3104.839 --> 3112.92
keep the Earth moving upward that

3109.02 --> 3116.359
yeah what about that one yeah

3112.92 --> 3119.819
the stationary Earth definitely does not

3116.359 --> 3122.52
require magical forces yeah we have

3119.819 --> 3124.98
relative density this equilibrium

3122.52 --> 3127.74
but

3124.98 --> 3130.68
it's there it's there within the realm

3127.74 --> 3133.0789999999997
there's no bizarre unexplained forces

3130.68 --> 3135.1189999999997
other than hey that seems to be there

3133.079 --> 3136.6800000000003
and we don't exactly know why but this

3135.119 --> 3138.96
is how it works

3136.68 --> 3141.359
you're gonna claim an upward Rising

3138.96 --> 3143.7
Earth well what the [ __ ] is making the

3141.359 --> 3147.0589999999997
Earth rising up then

3143.7 --> 3150.72
yeah that that's a force by by Newtonian

3147.059 --> 3152.94
logic mechanics yeah so how what is

3150.72 --> 3155.54
doing that

3152.94 --> 3158.16
where's the rocket pack

3155.54 --> 3160.2
underneath earth right it's total

3158.16 --> 3162.319
horseshit it's projection if you're

3160.2 --> 3165.839
gonna say stitches

3162.319 --> 3168.42
requires extraordinary forces oh really

3165.839 --> 3170.64
what about upward moving Earth

3168.42 --> 3172.8
there's definitely going to be some

3170.64 --> 3175.3799999999997
freaking Magical Force that's making it

3172.8 --> 3178.2000000000003
do that isn't it

3175.38 --> 3180.3
because you're claiming the movement of

3178.2 --> 3183.859
the whole so what is that force that is

3180.3 --> 3183.8590000000004
making the whole move like that

3188.9 --> 3195.0
movement through a medium stops in three

3192.059 --> 3197.2200000000003
four yeah that's cute

3195.0 --> 3200.16
I know how relative density works and

3197.22 --> 3202.74
hey yeah if you are moving because you

3200.16 --> 3207.48
are more dense than a medium you're in

3202.74 --> 3210.66
then whatever is within you

3207.48 --> 3213.3
you as a separated medium that is also

3210.66 --> 3216.24
the object yeah then what is in you oh

3213.3 --> 3219.7200000000003
relative density this equilibrium

3216.24 --> 3221.8799999999997
doesn't work as normally yeah because

3219.72 --> 3224.8799999999997
it's already working you're already

3221.88 --> 3227.6400000000003
moving and then what is happening within

3224.88 --> 3230.819
the thing that is moving is different as

3227.64 --> 3234.96
what would happen within a stationary

3230.819 --> 3239.339
median right because a moving thing is

3234.96 --> 3240.78
not a stationary medium it's moving

3239.339 --> 3243.7799999999997
yeah

3240.78 --> 3246.559
that's how that works I've not assumed

3243.78 --> 3250.2000000000003
stationary stationary is not a claim

3246.559 --> 3252.5400000000004
stationary is a description of nothing

3250.2 --> 3253.859
happening

3252.54 --> 3257.099
you can't

3253.859 --> 3260.22
prove nothing happening

3257.099 --> 3264.059
you'd have to prove something happening

3260.22 --> 3266.3999999999996
that would disprove nothing happening

3264.059 --> 3270.3190000000004
there is nothing to disprove nothing

3266.4 --> 3270.319
happening Earth is stationary

3270.359 --> 3273.44
it's not a claim

3273.599 --> 3276.559
it's an end result

3278.94 --> 3285.0
so objects can move by themselves

3282.3 --> 3287.76
does it require a force

3285.0 --> 3290.64
yeah it does require a force relative

3287.76 --> 3291.6600000000003
density this equilibrium force it is

3290.64 --> 3293.7
that

3291.66 --> 3297.0589999999997
it is what's happening

3293.7 --> 3298.4399999999996
it is scientifically proven that that is

3297.059 --> 3301.5
what's happening

3298.44 --> 3304.26
there's this magical force that just

3301.5 --> 3306.24
happens under very specific conditions

3304.26 --> 3310.38
the conditions being

3306.24 --> 3312.4799999999996
a differential between the density of an

3310.38 --> 3315.1800000000003
object and the density of a medium oh

3312.48 --> 3319.079
there is a differential oh a force

3315.18 --> 3321.5989999999997
happens it it just move it accelerates

3319.079 --> 3324.1800000000003
wow yeah yeah that's what's happening

3321.599 --> 3325.98
every time it's perfectly described it

3324.18 --> 3330.2999999999997
is consistent it is scientifically

3325.98 --> 3333.2
proven it is arguably a natural law it's

3330.3 --> 3333.2000000000003
that consistent

3337.22 --> 3342.3799999999997
now it's not a claim of acceleration

3344.059 --> 3350.88
its claim of a force relative density

3347.28 --> 3354.8
this equilibrium force it is there it

3350.88 --> 3354.8
happens it's scientifically proven

3355.26 --> 3360.1800000000003
through

3356.78 --> 3364.38
repeatable experiment

3360.18 --> 3366.18
that is valid scientifically valid

3364.38 --> 3368.1600000000003
yeah that's the difference there's no

3366.18 --> 3369.66
presupposition there it's scientifically

3368.16 --> 3372.6189999999997
valid

3369.66 --> 3372.6189999999997
and repeatable

3380.7 --> 3385.3799999999997
that's [ __ ]

3382.44 --> 3388.2000000000003
things accelerate up too

3385.38 --> 3389.819
and it works just the same yeah

3388.2 --> 3391.5
the helium balloon

3389.819 --> 3393.7799999999997
is less dense than the air that

3391.5 --> 3396.359
surrounds it it's going to accelerate up

3393.78 --> 3399.96
and then eventually that acceleration is

3396.359 --> 3402.74
going to be evened out because well the

3399.96 --> 3406.14
balloon still will have friction

3402.74 --> 3410.64
maneuvering through the air

3406.14 --> 3412.5589999999997
and that will give a a speed limit

3410.64 --> 3415.02
to the acceleration there will be a

3412.559 --> 3417.599
maximum upward velocity too for the

3415.02 --> 3419.22
helium balloon because it still has to

3417.599 --> 3421.98
pass through

3419.22 --> 3425.8799999999997
gas that is slowing it down through

3421.98 --> 3429.68
friction and friction always results in

3425.88 --> 3429.6800000000003
a maximum velocity

3430.8 --> 3437.3
because acceleration is always

3432.78 --> 3437.3
eventually stopped by friction

3438.9 --> 3445.7400000000002
can I play your video I don't know I

3442.619 --> 3449.3
don't usually do that

3445.74 --> 3449.2999999999997
I can take a look at it

3450.72 --> 3455.1189999999997
no definitely not doing that

3461.3 --> 3465.559
I'm definitely not doing that

3467.56 --> 3470.619
[Music]

3471.319 --> 3475.98
you mistaken upward moving Earth is a

3474.24 --> 3479.3999999999996
reification of gravity

3475.98 --> 3481.5
it's an explanation to gravity in this

3479.4 --> 3484.98
year

3481.5 --> 3487.5
to the Newtonian gravity and it is

3484.98 --> 3489.3
it is Newtonian gravity

3487.5 --> 3491.579
sort of

3489.3 --> 3494.119
or Newtonian mechanics at least but with

3491.579 --> 3494.119
a flat Earth

3495.18 --> 3501.14
right upward Rising Earth does not work

3498.119 --> 3501.1400000000003
at all with a ball

3520.2 --> 3526.5589999999997
but upwards Rising Earth what it does is

3523.38 --> 3530.1600000000003
it plays into the relativity game

3526.559 --> 3532.44
right that even Ballers proponents play

3530.16 --> 3535.0789999999997
out with their astrophysics

3532.44 --> 3537.599
but they claim the up basically what

3535.079 --> 3540.0
they do is claim the upward Rising Earth

3537.599 --> 3541.38
but with a ball and it's like yeah but

3540.0 --> 3542.64
that makes no sense because then it

3541.38 --> 3546.78
would be accelerating in all directions

3542.64 --> 3549.0589999999997
yeah but that doesn't happen so just

3546.78 --> 3550.92
imagine like it's an upward Rising Earth

3549.059 --> 3552.599
but it's still a ball and it is upright

3550.92 --> 3555.839
rising in all Direction it makes

3552.599 --> 3557.76
absolutely no [ __ ] sense but you can

3555.839 --> 3560.4
think of it like that

3557.76 --> 3561.7200000000003
that's how convoluted the official ball

3560.4 --> 3564.359
based

3561.72 --> 3566.04
story about that is like oh wanna know

3564.359 --> 3568.0789999999997
gravity jump off a building and you'll

3566.04 --> 3569.7599999999998
notice that oh maybe it's not you that's

3568.079 --> 3571.92
moving down it's everything moving up

3569.76 --> 3574.8590000000004
right

3571.92 --> 3577.859
well that's literally that same or

3574.859 --> 3580.799
nonsense indoctrination [ __ ] that

3577.859 --> 3583.02
the astrophysics that people like to

3580.799 --> 3584.94
spread around because it makes them feel

3583.02 --> 3587.46
so smart

3584.94 --> 3590.7000000000003
and that same [ __ ] has been assimilated

3587.46 --> 3593.099
by Dell and a bunch of other people

3590.7 --> 3595.2
and adapted to a flat Earth

3593.099 --> 3596.94
and now they don't have to like oh you

3595.2 --> 3598.6189999999997
have to imagine it accelerating in all

3596.94 --> 3601.5
directions like it's going upward no no

3598.619 --> 3604.92
it is literally going upward now

3601.5 --> 3608.7
but you're still stuck to never ever

3604.92 --> 3610.859
being able to prove your premise ever

3608.7 --> 3613.74
you can't prove it accelerates upward

3610.859 --> 3615.9
you you can't separate yourself from the

3613.74 --> 3617.8799999999997
Earth to prove that it is a separate

3615.9 --> 3620.2200000000003
reference frame from what surrounds it

3617.88 --> 3622.38
in order to prove that it is moving in

3620.22 --> 3624.9599999999996
relation to whatever supposedly

3622.38 --> 3627.42
surrounds it there might not be anything

3624.96 --> 3629.64
that surrounds it

3627.42 --> 3632.04
if there is not anything that surrounds

3629.64 --> 3633.1189999999997
the Earth realm then it's not moving

3632.04 --> 3635.4
upward

3633.119 --> 3637.7400000000002
because it makes no sense there's a

3635.4 --> 3640.2000000000003
moving is always in relation to

3637.74 --> 3642.7799999999997
something else

3640.2 --> 3646.4399999999996
otherwise it isn't moving

3642.78 --> 3648.92
is literally not classified as moving if

3646.44 --> 3648.92
it isn't

3650.88 --> 3657.42
so it's a cute idea

3654.0 --> 3659.22
but you can never actually prove it it's

3657.42 --> 3661.619
always going to be a mathematical

3659.22 --> 3664.799
proposition

3661.619 --> 3667.38
as something you can think of it as of

3664.799 --> 3670.94
you can think of it as as such that's it

3667.38 --> 3670.94
that's as far as you can go with it

3680.64 --> 3688.4
oh I haven't got a clue well then you're

3683.28 --> 3688.4
just a [ __ ] gnarly [ __ ] RJC

3689.099 --> 3695.119
I understood upward Rising Earth 20

3692.46 --> 3695.119
years ago

3696.0 --> 3702.42
yeah don't [ __ ] tell me I don't

3698.52 --> 3705.2
understand you're just a nasty [ __ ] then

3702.42 --> 3705.2000000000003
how about that

3706.04 --> 3710.299
Garrison liquid displays and their

3708.66 --> 3715.46
conditions everything

3710.299 --> 3715.46
displaces under acceleration everything

3716.52 --> 3719.52
foreign

3726.799 --> 3731.819
only displaces

3729.359 --> 3734.819
when the medium that carries it

3731.819 --> 3736.079
displaces because gas doesn't have

3734.819 --> 3738.48
momentum

3736.079 --> 3741.799
it can only be pushed around by the

3738.48 --> 3741.799
median that contains it

3760.5 --> 3767.599
what what the [ __ ] are you talking about

3762.839 --> 3767.599
then RJC what the [ __ ] is this crap

3767.72 --> 3773.22
are you just just being belligerent here

3770.88 --> 3775.1400000000003
I'm gonna kick you the [ __ ] out though I

3773.22 --> 3776.7599999999998
mean it's been entertaining to address

3775.14 --> 3779.339
your idiocy

3776.76 --> 3781.2000000000003
but if you're just gonna be a nasty [ __ ]

3779.339 --> 3783.54
like Dell likes to be when he gets

3781.2 --> 3786.0
cornered and has no more arguments left

3783.54 --> 3787.319
and start scatter gunning projecting his

3786.0 --> 3791.099
garbage

3787.319 --> 3792.54
I will just kick you out then

3791.099 --> 3796.52
okay

3792.54 --> 3796.52
I do know what I'm talking about

3806.46 --> 3812.66
they'll claim the Aristotle's fallacy

3809.18 --> 3812.66
I'm sure he does

3839.94 --> 3845.7000000000003
yeah I'm not going to go into Dell's

3843.599 --> 3848.28
version of how it's supposed to work

3845.7 --> 3849.5989999999997
he's got everything wrong everything

3848.28 --> 3852.42
he's got around

3849.599 --> 3855.2400000000002
like his entire conception of how upward

3852.42 --> 3857.54
Rising Earth even moves how that works

3855.24 --> 3860.839
is absolutely

3857.54 --> 3860.839
disastrously wrong

3861.119 --> 3866.52
he's just like he has genuinely got

3864.66 --> 3869.3999999999996
everything wrong

3866.52 --> 3872.7
when he talks about that [ __ ] it's the

3869.4 --> 3875.099
most broken description I've ever had

3872.7 --> 3877.02
the displeasure of seeing anybody roll

3875.099 --> 3879.98
out ever

3877.02 --> 3879.98
with this subject

3881.88 --> 3887.88
I mean if you can follow what he

3885.48 --> 3891.92
actually says and then make a logical

3887.88 --> 3891.92
consistent structure out of that

3894.859 --> 3903.299
that's special because I sure can

3900.299 --> 3905.16
nothing about his conclusions makes any

3903.299 --> 3909.44
damn sense

3905.16 --> 3912.299
it is borderline psychotic

3909.44 --> 3914.819
just the conclusions and the connections

3912.299 --> 3916.799
is just makes no [ __ ] sense about

3914.819 --> 3920.16
anything he said about it it's

3916.799 --> 3923.599
completely idiotic

3920.16 --> 3926.7
like I know upward Rising Earth

3923.599 --> 3929.96
way better than Dell and I knew it

3926.7 --> 3929.96
freaking 20 years ago

3930.9 --> 3935.76
I know what it is

3933.119 --> 3938.94
I know how you can't prove it that's why

3935.76 --> 3941.4
as soon as it came in the attention on

3938.94 --> 3944.2400000000002
social media here with Dell and

3941.4 --> 3947.76
everybody I immediately made that video

3944.24 --> 3949.8799999999997
with it in the title it can never prove

3947.76 --> 3949.88
it

3951.0 --> 3957.72
because I know about that

3953.94 --> 3960.319
because I I remember it from 20 years

3957.72 --> 3960.319
ago

3962.09 --> 3965.28
[Music]

3981.54 --> 3987.14
Coddington what

3984.059 --> 3987.1400000000003
where's Coddington

3990.299 --> 3995.4
I mean if there's any super chats

3992.94 --> 3999.079
love to hear about it

3995.4 --> 3999.079
by all means sponsor me

3999.66 --> 4004.8799999999997
maybe if just so that Dell can complain

4002.48 --> 4007.94
how much I eat bag and [ __ ]

4004.88 --> 4010.94
because he does think that's absolutely

4007.94 --> 4010.94
disgraceful

4013.52 --> 4020.5
so please send me some support I could

4015.74 --> 4020.5
really use it or I'm not gonna have

4020.539 --> 4025.7000000000003
a lot of

4023.0 --> 4029.119
well I'm basically not gonna have any uh

4025.7 --> 4031.2799999999997
more Illuminati croissants

4029.119 --> 4033.44
and goes to energy drinks if I don't get

4031.28 --> 4036.4
any kind of support today

4033.44 --> 4036.4
just so you know

4039.26 --> 4042.3390000000004
anyway cheers

4043.16 --> 4047.2599999999998
okay

4045.14 --> 4047.2599999999998
um

4074.059 --> 4079.52
okay turret I mean

4076.819 --> 4082.42
doesn't matter that much to me the

4079.52 --> 4082.42
difference there but

4107.179 --> 4112.46
yeah let's do a little silly mind

4110.6 --> 4114.7390000000005
[ __ ]

4112.46 --> 4116.2390000000005
for a second

4114.739 --> 4118.459999999999
and just say

4116.239 --> 4120.62
what if I told you that when Dell

4118.46 --> 4123.88
dropped the bottle it actually

4120.62 --> 4123.88
accelerated upward

4125.239 --> 4129.8589999999995
ever thought of that

4127.64 --> 4133.219
yeah it may seem like it was going down

4129.859 --> 4136.52
but it was actually accelerating upward

4133.219 --> 4137.719
it just wasn't accelerating upward as

4136.52 --> 4139.759
much

4137.719 --> 4141.859
as the Earth was accelerating upward

4139.759 --> 4145.299
because it was the Earth's accelerating

4141.859 --> 4145.299
upward even faster

4146.12 --> 4150.799
right

4147.08 --> 4153.08
but when Dell dropped the bottle well he

4150.799 --> 4155.7789999999995
was accelerating upward

4153.08 --> 4159.04
faster than the bottle was accelerating

4155.779 --> 4159.040000000001
upward see

4161.54 --> 4166.12
he can even say the same thing the other

4163.699 --> 4166.12
way around

4171.739 --> 4176.3589999999995
right when he was dropping the bottle it

4174.38 --> 4180.6990000000005
was actually like

4176.359 --> 4180.6990000000005
going down at light speed

4183.08 --> 4190.219
it's just that the Earth

4186.5 --> 4193.279
was going down at slightly less than

4190.219 --> 4195.7390000000005
light speed see

4193.279 --> 4198.080000000001
because when you do this sort of

4195.739 --> 4200.9
nonsense reference frame based mind

4198.08 --> 4203.0599999999995
experiment you can think of whatever the

4200.9 --> 4204.259999999999
[ __ ] is happening however the [ __ ] you

4203.06 --> 4206.6
want

4204.26 --> 4210.88
because it's all relative

4206.6 --> 4210.88
and nothing is actually proven

4243.38 --> 4246.159000000001
hmm

4264.56 --> 4270.5
deros

4266.78 --> 4273.5
the prop look you can have

4270.5 --> 4276.8
sort of it's difficult but it's possible

4273.5 --> 4278.48
you can have mediums of liquid and gas

4276.8 --> 4281.3
and solids

4278.48 --> 4283.639999999999
move in nature

4281.3 --> 4286.9400000000005
like a

4283.64 --> 4288.860000000001
a dirt slide a Mudslide

4286.94 --> 4291.678999999999
in a waterfall

4288.86 --> 4293.659
much light that ends up at a waterfall

4291.679 --> 4296.4800000000005
and so

4293.659 --> 4299.12
you can sort of if you make a lot of

4296.48 --> 4302.0599999999995
effort create a natural phenomenon for

4299.12 --> 4304.34
whatever he's doing the problem is not

4302.06 --> 4306.26
whether it is a natural phenomenon or

4304.34 --> 4307.6900000000005
not the problem is is that he doesn't

4306.26 --> 4310.93
have a freaking phenomenon

4307.69 --> 4310.929999999999
[Music]

4317.06 --> 4320.6
right because

4323.96 --> 4329.2390000000005
he's just pointing at something that's

4325.94 --> 4332.48
happening and then not

4329.239 --> 4335.5599999999995
changing anything he's not actually very

4332.48 --> 4335.5599999999995
manipulating anything

4336.02 --> 4343.540000000001
right it's only about do you see it as

4339.38 --> 4343.54
if it was this or that

4344.12 --> 4349.76
throwing a bottle out of the window

4347.78 --> 4352.4
doesn't do anything it doesn't prove

4349.76 --> 4354.92
anything it doesn't have

4352.4 --> 4356.599999999999
a phenomena it doesn't even describe

4354.92 --> 4361.179
what is happening

4356.6 --> 4361.179
he's just using it to say nah ah

4361.82 --> 4366.139999999999
doesn't work that you can't throw a

4363.86 --> 4368.179
bottle and then say now about relative

4366.14 --> 4372.14
density when the experiment for relative

4368.179 --> 4374.36
density is proven and repeatable

4372.14 --> 4378.860000000001
and it always works

4374.36 --> 4383.659
and what happens to an accelerating

4378.86 --> 4385.639999999999
medium is not part of the hypothesis for

4383.659 --> 4388.099999999999
relative density yeah

4385.64 --> 4391.159000000001
if you'd want to explore what happens

4388.1 --> 4394.400000000001
with an accelerating medium then you'd

4391.159 --> 4395.599999999999
have to maneuver away from relative

4394.4 --> 4397.5199999999995
density

4395.6 --> 4399.400000000001
and go into the territory of

4397.52 --> 4402.1990000000005
non-scientific

4399.4 --> 4403.9
Advanced relative density to just see

4402.199 --> 4408.699
what happens

4403.9 --> 4408.699
just to describe what happens roughly

4409.4 --> 4414.5599999999995
and it is still compatible

4412.04 --> 4417.34
it's just you can't really hypothesize

4414.56 --> 4417.34
it properly

4418.58 --> 4423.92
right

4420.44 --> 4427.94
so relative density is

4423.92 --> 4433.219
always about what happens with an object

4427.94 --> 4436.82
in a medium that's stationary because if

4433.219 --> 4440.4800000000005
it's moving if the medium's moving

4436.82 --> 4443.0
well then the medium is and should be

4440.48 --> 4446.0
considered within basic relative density

4443.0 --> 4449.3
as the object

4446.0 --> 4451.64
that is moving within the medium the

4449.3 --> 4454.9400000000005
medium being stationary

4451.64 --> 4456.679
which would be Earth Realm that's what

4454.94 --> 4458.54
something that's going to be moving is

4456.679 --> 4461.179
going to be moving in

4458.54 --> 4465.32
so whatever's moving within that little

4461.179 --> 4465.33
medium is not relevant

4465.32 --> 4467.12
to

4465.33 --> 4470.659
[Music]

4467.12 --> 4473.719
the relative density experiment

4470.659 --> 4476.78
because if a medium would be moving then

4473.719 --> 4481.2390000000005
it is definitely moving within

4476.78 --> 4484.159
the stationary realm and thus should

4481.239 --> 4488.9
within context of relative density

4484.159 --> 4494.839999999999
experiment be considered the object

4488.9 --> 4498.139999999999
in the median and not as its own medium

4494.84 --> 4502.04
separately because it is accelerating it

4498.14 --> 4504.679
is moving when a medium is moving basic

4502.04 --> 4507.8
relative density which is always

4504.679 --> 4511.28
from a stationary perspective

4507.8 --> 4515.12
it doesn't apply verbatim

4511.28 --> 4516.199
Advanced relative density starts to come

4515.12 --> 4520.04
into play

4516.199 --> 4522.799999999999
right if the medium is moving then the

4520.04 --> 4526.239
axis of density how it arranges within

4522.8 --> 4528.8
that moving medium is gonna

4526.239 --> 4531.98
re-express itself so if it is

4528.8 --> 4536.06
accelerating downward at a at a steady

4531.98 --> 4538.339999999999
fall rate it's gonna negate

4536.06 --> 4541.219
relative density within that

4538.34 --> 4543.5
accelerating medium

4541.219 --> 4546.5
but it doesn't negate relative density

4543.5 --> 4548.96
as a theory because that thing is

4546.5 --> 4551.84
accelerating it's an object accelerating

4548.96 --> 4554.06
and the object as a whole is still

4551.84 --> 4557.32
definitely performing in accordance to

4554.06 --> 4557.320000000001
relative density Theory

4557.659 --> 4561.5199999999995
you're not disproving it

4565.64 --> 4572.0
ever original diroshu stupid man-made

4568.159 --> 4575.0599999999995
balls you can bypass that I don't care

4572.0 --> 4577.34
about oh man-made [ __ ] man-made

4575.06 --> 4580.400000000001
yeah I don't care

4577.34 --> 4582.1990000000005
you can figure it out in nature

4580.4 --> 4584.599999999999
what he's complaining about is something

4582.199 --> 4586.4
that happens in nature the point is it

4584.6 --> 4589.88
doesn't [ __ ] matter

4586.4 --> 4592.5199999999995
because relative density the variables

4589.88 --> 4594.9800000000005
within the experiment are the object and

4592.52 --> 4596.780000000001
the medium the medium being stationary

4594.98 --> 4599.62
the object

4596.78 --> 4602.96
performing in accordance to the theory

4599.62 --> 4606.94
within the stationary medium that's the

4602.96 --> 4610.64
experiment if the medium is accelerating

4606.94 --> 4614.5599999999995
then the parameters for relative density

4610.64 --> 4614.56
Theory are violated

4615.38 --> 4621.7390000000005
that's not how you should do it

4619.4 --> 4624.679
the medium is accelerating it works

4621.739 --> 4627.139999999999
differently it's about stationary so if

4624.679 --> 4629.3
any medium is accelerating well guess

4627.14 --> 4631.88
what that Medium is definitely going to

4629.3 --> 4633.9800000000005
be considered an object as a whole

4631.88 --> 4636.86
whatever the [ __ ] is happening inside is

4633.98 --> 4639.678999999999
irrelevant the object as a whole

4636.86 --> 4642.44
will be an object within the medium of

4639.679 --> 4645.8
the realm that is stationary

4642.44 --> 4648.259999999999
and so if you literally it's not

4645.8 --> 4650.2390000000005
relevant to the exact experiment if you

4648.26 --> 4653.0
just ignore what is inside of the object

4650.239 --> 4655.58
just look at the object as a whole its

4653.0 --> 4657.62
density as a whole versus the density of

4655.58 --> 4659.78
the medium it is in it will perform

4657.62 --> 4661.4
perfectly in accordance to relative

4659.78 --> 4662.84
density Theory

4661.4 --> 4664.759999999999
it will

4662.84 --> 4666.56
whatever's happening inside of it is

4664.76 --> 4668.42
irrelevant

4666.56 --> 4671.96
the parameters

4668.42 --> 4675.4400000000005
for the experiment have been performed

4671.96 --> 4678.5
and they do work out no matter whatever

4675.44 --> 4679.699
side effect you might be seeing

4678.5 --> 4684.1
[Music]

4679.699 --> 4684.099999999999
it still works and works perfectly

4685.94 --> 4689.129999999999
[Music]

4690.04 --> 4695.98
a link to this Theory

4692.78 --> 4695.98
I'm explaining it

4700.58 --> 4704.96
there might be a link to this Theory I

4703.34 --> 4708.26
did

4704.96 --> 4711.02
a dedicated show

4708.26 --> 4713.360000000001
with it in the title Advanced relative

4711.02 --> 4716.4800000000005
density

4713.36 --> 4718.4
in the early bird show like a month ago

4716.48 --> 4719.299999999999
or something you have to scroll back a

4718.4 --> 4721.759999999999
bit

4719.3 --> 4724.4800000000005
but I've done plenty of shows dedicated

4721.76 --> 4724.4800000000005
to this subject

4742.76 --> 4749.3
all right yeah you're not going towards

4745.159 --> 4753.5199999999995
Rachel DeRose stop trying to encourage

4749.3 --> 4753.52
them stop enabling them

4757.52 --> 4761.360000000001
what you're saying right there is like

4759.32 --> 4764.0599999999995
telling the bullets I really wish you

4761.36 --> 4766.5199999999995
gave that actual natural phenomenon of

4764.06 --> 4769.46
gravity it's like what you're gonna

4766.52 --> 4772.040000000001
encourage them some more you know it

4769.46 --> 4777.1
doesn't exist why do you keep pushing it

4772.04 --> 4777.1
don't encourage their insanity

4784.1 --> 4789.8
don't try

4785.96 --> 4793.1
upward Rising earthers don't try to push

4789.8 --> 4794.2390000000005
them to prove their [ __ ] there isn't any

4793.1 --> 4797.38
proof

4794.239 --> 4800.219999999999
it's just gonna aggravate everything

4797.38 --> 4803.12
you feel awake oh yes

4800.22 --> 4805.6990000000005
[Music]

4803.12 --> 4808.04
that's gonna prove it you're just

4805.699 --> 4810.94
assuming it's there because Earth is

4808.04 --> 4810.94
upward Rising

4812.38 --> 4819.32
that's fun no it's not fun it's bad

4816.679 --> 4821.12
it's bad I don't want to do that I don't

4819.32 --> 4823.299999999999
want to be caught on the internet doing

4821.12 --> 4826.28
that

4823.3 --> 4829.06
these people are freaking basket cases

4826.28 --> 4829.0599999999995
as it is

4847.88 --> 4854.62
D Rose if you're gonna crunk out in my

4851.0 --> 4854.62
chat you gotta Super Chat Me

4859.58 --> 4864.82
you can be like that but you gotta pay

4861.8 --> 4864.820000000001
me on the PayPal

4872.3 --> 4875.3
foreign

4883.46 --> 4886.179
foreign

4906.14 --> 4911.179
if you can I mean I could really use it

4908.739 --> 4914.379999999999
I'm glad to have you in my chapter I'm

4911.179 --> 4914.38
not telling you to get the hell out

4917.179 --> 4921.34
but you are being a bit naughty so

4926.239 --> 4932.799999999999
go there aggravate them yeah so if

4929.42 --> 4932.8
there's a basket case

4935.239 --> 4939.86
I mean what you're doing original D Rose

4937.64 --> 4942.58
is basically noticing oh that guy's

4939.86 --> 4945.38
[ __ ] insane he's in a prison

4942.58 --> 4947.36
he's quite insane he's rambling and

4945.38 --> 4948.62
raving on what you're gonna walk over to

4947.36 --> 4953.739
that prison

4948.62 --> 4953.739
and just start shouting through the bars

4953.84 --> 4957.46
because that's kind of what you're doing

4967.94 --> 4972.44
Dell is acting clinically insane and I

4971.06 --> 4974.9800000000005
don't want to make it worse that it

4972.44 --> 4974.98
already is

4975.56 --> 4979.6990000000005
I'm just kind of hoping it's gonna go

4977.54 --> 4982.6
away at some point and that

4979.699 --> 4982.599999999999
was gonna

4983.42 --> 4988.52
just

4985.1 --> 4991.9400000000005
get his bearing back

4988.52 --> 4996.080000000001
and either really restore himself or get

4991.94 --> 4997.82
the [ __ ] out of here like get the [ __ ]

4996.08 --> 5001.84
out though

4997.82 --> 5004.84
you irredeemable [ __ ]

5001.84 --> 5006.9400000000005
it's not funny anymore you're a

5004.84 --> 5010.38
disgusting person with what you're doing

5006.94 --> 5010.379999999999
like how you do it

5012.1 --> 5018.159000000001
I need I knew you were a little loose at

5014.92 --> 5021.219
all that for years but you're just so

5018.159 --> 5023.679
[ __ ] up now it is

5021.219 --> 5025.96
you're worse than the anti-flat earthers

5023.679 --> 5030.04
you're worse than those scumbags that

5025.96 --> 5033.04
kept harassing around 2016. you are

5030.04 --> 5034.78
worse Dell

5033.04 --> 5037.08
I don't want to have anything to do with

5034.78 --> 5037.08
you anymore

5039.94 --> 5045.759999999999
the only reason I ever even click

5043.36 --> 5048.099999999999
on anything that comes from your channel

5045.76 --> 5051.58
is just to take

5048.1 --> 5054.6990000000005
bearing like taking a water sample just

5051.58 --> 5057.04
to see how poisoned the ground is I just

5054.699 --> 5059.678999999999
want to get a little sniff of how [ __ ]

5057.04 --> 5063.3
up you've actually become because it

5059.679 --> 5063.3
radiates off you

5065.5 --> 5072.1
like radiation from a rod of uranium

5068.92 --> 5074.86
it's radiating off you how incredibly

5072.1 --> 5077.6990000000005
[ __ ] up you've become and I like to

5074.86 --> 5077.699
keep track of that

5080.38 --> 5085.39
so that I can warn people properly like

5083.199 --> 5088.509
that's not the place you want to be

5085.39 --> 5088.509
[Music]

5094.42 --> 5098.38
talking with the matters not even oh you

5096.4 --> 5101.799999999999
don't give a [ __ ] dude

5098.38 --> 5104.26
you think I give a [ __ ] he's not here

5101.8 --> 5108.360000000001
who cares

5104.26 --> 5108.360000000001
he's a rambling crazy person

5120.52 --> 5127.900000000001
I mean at this point Merle

5124.659 --> 5130.12
is more intellectually cohesive than

5127.9 --> 5134.259999999999
Dell okay

5130.12 --> 5136.48
and if you remember Merle you know

5134.26 --> 5140.04
how bad it is

5136.48 --> 5140.04
where else from a long time ago

5141.34 --> 5147.179
it's a kind of an esoteric thinker but

5143.679 --> 5147.179
he's very weird and vague

5153.699 --> 5155.699
um

5163.84 --> 5168.46
now what you said supersedes what I've

5166.84 --> 5173.1
been doing

5168.46 --> 5173.1
I went hard did I yeah I guess

5176.199 --> 5182.86
but I mean dude for me it's a real it is

5179.44 --> 5184.239
tragedy I I mean I found Dell since the

5182.86 --> 5186.4
early days

5184.239 --> 5188.199
he was always a bit

5186.4 --> 5189.82
wrong

5188.199 --> 5193.0599999999995
and [ __ ]

5189.82 --> 5197.759999999999
but now he's just nasty

5193.06 --> 5197.76
just nasty nasty nasty

5199.62 --> 5205.48
it just radiates that certain thing that

5202.96 --> 5207.78
just makes me want to do really bad

5205.48 --> 5207.78
things

5208.0 --> 5214.679
and it's like asking for that

5210.88 --> 5214.679
it's just like a come at me

5222.639 --> 5225.3
thank you

5240.639 --> 5246.52
a yo-yo without its string crashes to

5244.3 --> 5249.360000000001
the ground yeah without a string it's

5246.52 --> 5249.360000000001
not a yo-yo

5264.88 --> 5270.58
it's a yo

5268.06 --> 5273.3
it's just a circular piece of wood or

5270.58 --> 5273.3
something that's it

5280.659 --> 5284.92
yo he was dancing in the air that's

5282.94 --> 5288.879999999999
right

5284.92 --> 5290.639
and the relative density then drives

5288.88 --> 5294.52
the

5290.639 --> 5299.56
circular motion the gyroscopic effect

5294.52 --> 5302.080000000001
that stabilizes its angle like a wheel

5299.56 --> 5304.38
in space as it is suspended by the

5302.08 --> 5304.38
string

5324.9 --> 5331.179
okay the Eric Ash thank you

5329.02 --> 5333.639
I'm not distracted by negative Vibes

5331.179 --> 5335.56
it's just it's there I'm gonna address

5333.639 --> 5338.1990000000005
it I addressed it

5335.56 --> 5340.360000000001
people are addressing it

5338.199 --> 5343.719
what negative Vibes I'm doing great

5340.36 --> 5346.48
you're great only thing not super great

5343.719 --> 5351.179
is that I'd really like some support

5346.48 --> 5351.178999999999
and D Rose just kind of ignored me

5351.4 --> 5357.839999999999
when I asked him to uh

5355.42 --> 5357.84
support

5359.02 --> 5363.88
you support me no though oh cool

5362.5 --> 5366.82
oh

5363.88 --> 5370.139
I'm checking my PayPal right now I don't

5366.82 --> 5370.139
see anything there right now

5375.46 --> 5383.1
do temporal States indicate the eternal

5380.44 --> 5383.099999999999
now

5386.5 --> 5391.679
they specifically do not

5388.9 --> 5395.66
that's the entire point

5391.679 --> 5397.0
tempuro is an isolated incident

5395.66 --> 5400.659
[Music]

5397.0 --> 5402.1
it literally has no reference to the

5400.659 --> 5406.179
completeness

5402.1 --> 5409.3
or to anything of the

5406.179 --> 5412.4800000000005
that is not in that moment

5409.3 --> 5413.8
that Mo it's exclusive information about

5412.48 --> 5417.699
the moment

5413.8 --> 5420.820000000001
without any indication of what is going

5417.699 --> 5423.82
to surround that moment

5420.82 --> 5425.679
and that makes it temporal

5423.82 --> 5428.34
or no that's not Tempo that's

5425.679 --> 5428.34
contemporary

5433.54 --> 5439.48
do you mean contemporary with your

5436.659 --> 5443.04
temporal States because temporal is also

5439.48 --> 5443.04
like time related

5447.699 --> 5454.0599999999995
and I don't exactly know what type of

5449.86 --> 5457.599999999999
temporal states that we have then

5454.06 --> 5460.8
and how it would indicate the eternal

5457.6 --> 5460.8
just like

5460.96 --> 5465.219
if you're in a Timeless State like in

5463.42 --> 5467.86
the Dark World

5465.219 --> 5471.4
you still have a limit it's just that

5467.86 --> 5474.04
the time within the limitations is

5471.4 --> 5476.5599999999995
you can be anywhere within what is

5474.04 --> 5479.8
available but you can't literally go

5476.56 --> 5482.860000000001
beyond yourself

5479.8 --> 5486.12
beyond the time of yourself

5482.86 --> 5486.12
except through

5486.179 --> 5491.4400000000005
foreseeing of others

5488.92 --> 5494.46
or through historical reference

5491.44 --> 5494.46
when you want to go back

5507.719 --> 5515.58
but nice try there

5511.54 --> 5515.58
you have a question Tara oh fire away

5522.639 --> 5527.1990000000005
it's tough on Nathan's show because I

5524.5 --> 5530.02
can't get a word in yeah I know but I

5527.199 --> 5534.54
mean it is what it is and I get plenty

5530.02 --> 5534.540000000001
of words in here you know so I'm good

5540.94 --> 5546.879999999999
and hey if you would like to to hear

5544.239 --> 5550.419999999999
more because I don't get a word in

5546.88 --> 5553.2390000000005
during fed well guess what there's a

5550.42 --> 5555.6990000000005
flat Earth early bird show where I get

5553.239 --> 5557.94
the word in non-stop from beginning to

5555.699 --> 5557.94
end

5559.659 --> 5562.659
foreign

5570.46 --> 5574.679
what the hell are you talking about

5572.26 --> 5574.679
Terry

5575.56 --> 5579.34
that's horseshit

5608.26 --> 5612.42
can't master me okay

5618.46 --> 5623.62
that's not master B that's just a

5620.92 --> 5625.4800000000005
private chat

5623.62 --> 5629.4
original deros

5625.48 --> 5632.82
Master B is not where you ask that

5629.4 --> 5632.82
but that's cool

5633.52 --> 5636.52
foreign

5646.04 --> 5649.13
[Applause]

5669.05 --> 5672.069
[Music]

5692.56 --> 5696.76
the topic hasn't been properly resolved

5695.5 --> 5699.1
yet

5696.76 --> 5701.1990000000005
now it has it has absolutely been

5699.1 --> 5703.3
resolved RJC

5701.199 --> 5706.839999999999
I mean how many times do I need to

5703.3 --> 5709.84
resolve it over and over again

5706.84 --> 5709.84
foreign

5718.12 --> 5721.98
who the hell were you talking about then

5722.5 --> 5729.219
I didn't get the joke that's right I

5725.32 --> 5733.0199999999995
absolutely did not get the joke

5729.219 --> 5733.02
I didn't even realize there was a joke

5753.82 --> 5760.78
I think your temporal States May mean

5756.82 --> 5764.32
the passage of time that's

5760.78 --> 5767.92
the worst way to translate that ever

5764.32 --> 5770.92
then like how is a temporal state

5767.92 --> 5774.52
relating to the passage of time

5770.92 --> 5777.219
the state that is in what is a state

5774.52 --> 5780.580000000001
it's a mindset like state of mind yeah

5777.219 --> 5783.4800000000005
temporal state so the way of being how

5780.58 --> 5787.239
does that relate to the experience

5783.48 --> 5790.239
specific experience of passage of time

5787.239 --> 5793.0599999999995
which is a consciousness-based

5790.239 --> 5796.36
experience you experience the passage of

5793.06 --> 5799.360000000001
time it's not a palpable thing

5796.36 --> 5802.12
in a temporal state is this the frame of

5799.36 --> 5804.5199999999995
mind or how the frequency of your

5802.12 --> 5808.32
Consciousness indicating

5804.52 --> 5808.320000000001
how you are perceiving things

5810.219 --> 5813.219
weird

5820.62 --> 5828.36
I think that's the way time works no

5824.56 --> 5828.360000000001
there is no time there's only

5829.239 --> 5832.44
the perception

5832.92 --> 5839.56
linearity there's linear perception

5836.38 --> 5842.04
and that is entropy

5839.56 --> 5844.7390000000005
and those are

5842.04 --> 5847.96
theoretically or mathematically

5844.739 --> 5850.919999999999
translated into a concept of time and

5847.96 --> 5850.92
that's what it really is

5866.08 --> 5871.0
what

5868.719 --> 5874.38
what the [ __ ] are you even talking to

5871.0 --> 5874.38
where's logical conclusion

5879.4 --> 5882.179
oh there he is

5889.36 --> 5891.78
hello

5892.3 --> 5898.659000000001
I'm sorry guys am I so oblivious that I

5895.719 --> 5901.679
didn't get terrett's joke

5898.659 --> 5904.659
I just don't get it

5901.679 --> 5907.78
I don't know what's so funny about oh

5904.659 --> 5910.42
all the Geniuses are all African I'm

5907.78 --> 5912.699
like oh that's the joke hahaha I don't

5910.42 --> 5915.9400000000005
[ __ ] get it what's so funny

5912.699 --> 5918.299999999999
about that not being true I just don't

5915.94 --> 5918.299999999999
get it

5920.62 --> 5923.5599999999995
maybe I'm just not racist enough or

5922.659 --> 5926.66
something

5923.56 --> 5929.7390000000005
I just don't get the joke

5926.66 --> 5929.739
[Music]

5940.6 --> 5943.9800000000005
I'm still not getting it

5945.28 --> 5954.179
a freaking being read aloud as African

5951.58 --> 5954.179
no

5956.8 --> 5962.08
yeah I hear you that's absolutely never

5959.8 --> 5965.26
how you ever pronounce it

5962.08 --> 5967.0599999999995
that only works in writing because it's

5965.26 --> 5970.06
visually

5967.06 --> 5973.42
is sort of similar

5970.06 --> 5975.76
but the pronunciation is totally

5973.42 --> 5977.92
different if you wouldn't read it you'd

5975.76 --> 5979.780000000001
never even notice that that that that's

5977.92 --> 5984.9
supposedly similar

5979.78 --> 5984.9
yeah African and a freaking

5985.0 --> 5990.82
like the a is very split apart from

5988.6 --> 5993.88
freaking

5990.82 --> 5996.599999999999
well it's directly connected with every

5993.88 --> 5996.6
every

6001.08 --> 6009.239
the guy who is a freaking genius comes

6005.28 --> 6012.259999999999
from Africa because he is African okay

6009.239 --> 6012.259999999999
I get it now

6017.1 --> 6020.6
I guess I ruined the joke

6021.36 --> 6025.699
I'm not super amused Alice

6032.46 --> 6034.52
what

6044.34 --> 6049.8
some weeds in general

6047.639 --> 6053.1
yeah I was actually gonna say something

6049.8 --> 6056.219
sort of racist

6053.1 --> 6058.4400000000005
like maybe you shouldn't rush to like

6056.219 --> 6061.62
separate from England yet you could

6058.44 --> 6063.36
really work on those comedy skills on on

6061.62 --> 6067.219
actual humor

6063.36 --> 6067.219
maybe you need them a little more

6068.58 --> 6072.199
because if you think that's funny

6072.6 --> 6074.6
ouch

6084.12 --> 6087.8
I'm basically just joking

6089.639 --> 6096.4400000000005
it wasn't that terrible it was just

6093.239 --> 6096.44
not very good

6105.179 --> 6111.84
are you using Godzilla's joke book right

6108.42 --> 6115.28
that's a very perceptive one oz

6111.84 --> 6115.28
it kind of is isn't it

6122.659 --> 6127.92
okay love fruit yeah thanks for being

6125.1 --> 6129.780000000001
there always fun to have you around

6127.92 --> 6131.96
probably gonna hand you a wrench at some

6129.78 --> 6131.96
point

6134.4 --> 6137.179
see you next time

6142.679 --> 6145.639

6171.61 --> 6174.688999999999

6188.92 --> 6191.9490000000005
[Music]

6198.9 --> 6205.259999999999
I use this type of joke because earlier

6202.08 --> 6207.9
it told me not to be 18 plus

6205.26 --> 6210.4800000000005
yeah I thank you for that turret

6207.9 --> 6212.638999999999
but I guess that you just don't really

6210.48 --> 6214.678999999999
have another choice I bet that your

6212.639 --> 6217.400000000001
smutty jokes are really good it's just

6214.679 --> 6217.4
inappropriate

6229.38 --> 6232.76
hey steamy Traveler

6241.98 --> 6248.36
oh it's hot

6245.159 --> 6248.36
enjoy dark humor

6252.84 --> 6257.9400000000005
said not to go too far with it

6255.78 --> 6260.34
right and I appreciate that you took

6257.94 --> 6263.04
note of that you do seem to go very

6260.34 --> 6266.119000000001
overboard sometimes it's just that's the

6263.04 --> 6266.119
way you are I get it

6267.06 --> 6272.219
but yeah

6269.119 --> 6276.08
be careful not to shoot

6272.219 --> 6276.08
too too wildly

6277.8 --> 6282.42
I mean you don't have to Super over tame

6280.199 --> 6285.9
every joke you try though

6282.42 --> 6289.28
just don't try to not like immediately

6285.9 --> 6289.28
go berserk with everything

6292.619 --> 6297.0199999999995
and yeah I know look who's talking the

6295.619 --> 6300.54
guy that goes

6297.02 --> 6303.360000000001
on camera like regularly I know

6300.54 --> 6305.4
it's not exactly the best example but

6303.36 --> 6308.159
because I do that that's not actually

6305.4 --> 6311.159
the signal for like oh hey everybody you

6308.159 --> 6314.219
all be like this now it's like no

6311.159 --> 6316.04
probably not probably better not to do

6314.219 --> 6318.42
that

6316.04 --> 6321.179
it's just I can't really help it

6318.42 --> 6323.52
sometimes it's just and I need

6321.179 --> 6325.92
I need to pile it on because I'm just

6323.52 --> 6328.4400000000005
making this point that's actually quite

6325.92 --> 6332.1
deep a lot of the time and if I don't

6328.44 --> 6334.678999999999
pile on the extra feels and all that

6332.1 --> 6338.639
and a bit of Overkill expressionism then

6334.679 --> 6342.0
I feel like it's not gonna come across

6338.639 --> 6344.6990000000005
which may actually be

6342.0 --> 6347.219
Folly to think that

6344.699 --> 6349.799999999999
but it's it's it happens impulsively

6347.219 --> 6350.76
it's just I get like very intense with

6349.8 --> 6353.34
things

6350.76 --> 6356.659000000001
a bit excessive and Tarot has that

6353.34 --> 6356.659000000001
tendency too I guess

6357.84 --> 6363.4400000000005
thank you

6359.06 --> 6363.4400000000005
lumpy gas in the vacuum could see you

6367.02 --> 6370.1990000000005
[Music]

6380.639 --> 6386.88
yeah but I get I used to enjoy really

6384.119 --> 6389.4
dark humor too turret

6386.88 --> 6391.619
in my Gothic face

6389.4 --> 6394.08
now I really don't and do I don't

6391.619 --> 6396.659
anymore it's just

6394.08 --> 6399.54
I don't actually enjoy it anymore I only

6396.659 --> 6402.259999999999
enjoy it like a devil and that's like

6399.54 --> 6405.96
evil I I have my moments where I'm like

6402.26 --> 6409.9800000000005
and I'm like yeah like really nastiness

6405.96 --> 6411.84
it amuses me but just because I have

6409.98 --> 6414.54
that and I'm sort of weirdly able to

6411.84 --> 6416.88
enjoy that doesn't mean that that's good

6414.54 --> 6419.219
that's not a conscious position I would

6416.88 --> 6421.88
ever take it it happens because of

6419.219 --> 6421.88
emotions

6427.679 --> 6432.4800000000005
so yeah I just I don't like dark humor

6430.679 --> 6434.82
anymore

6432.48 --> 6436.799999999999
I used to really like it but it just

6434.82 --> 6439.86
every time you let that it it just

6436.8 --> 6443.2390000000005
poisons everything it poisons the spirit

6439.86 --> 6443.239
Waters it really does

6446.14 --> 6451.139
[Music]

6448.139 --> 6453.659000000001
I've actually noticed that yeah sorry

6451.139 --> 6456.0
and I really sorry about this but dark

6453.659 --> 6458.82
humor actually poisons the spiritual

6456.0 --> 6460.8
Waters worse than if you're just

6458.82 --> 6463.159
straight out expressing anger about

6460.8 --> 6463.159000000001
something

6463.92 --> 6466.82
it does that

6470.34 --> 6476.34
if I'm going to be like uh say something

6472.679 --> 6478.08
really nasty backstabby and then like

6476.34 --> 6481.7390000000005
pretend like it didn't happen which is

6478.08 --> 6485.04
like sarcastic humor dark stuff

6481.739 --> 6487.08
that's way worse

6485.04 --> 6488.159
for yourself and for everybody that's

6487.08 --> 6491.04
there

6488.159 --> 6492.719
than if you just be like I [ __ ] hate

6491.04 --> 6495.119
that

6492.719 --> 6497.179
right and I don't want to talk about it

6495.119 --> 6500.5199999999995
like yeah that's

6497.179 --> 6504.54
but that actually leaves less damage

6500.52 --> 6506.34
than when you're gonna be really dark

6504.54 --> 6508.739
funny about it

6506.34 --> 6511.4400000000005
it does

6508.739 --> 6513.299999999999
it's also because of the sort of weird

6511.44 --> 6516.299999999999
dishonesty that tends to come with

6513.3 --> 6518.1
really dark humor

6516.3 --> 6520.38
because you're not really being honest

6518.1 --> 6522.6
about what is real

6520.38 --> 6526.139
when you do that

6522.6 --> 6528.179
it's downplaying evil in a way it's just

6526.139 --> 6530.9400000000005
that's part of the nature of it

6528.179 --> 6534.119
of really dark humor

6530.94 --> 6536.638999999999
that's why I would rather just go very

6534.119 --> 6538.799999999999
dark and like a raging foaming at the

6536.639 --> 6542.159000000001
mouth monster like

6538.8 --> 6544.38
then to be like like haha I'm so smart

6542.159 --> 6548.04
and then just be really dark

6544.38 --> 6550.7390000000005
in a in a funny way or something

6548.04 --> 6553.26
unless I'm like super angry at somebody

6550.739 --> 6555.36
right in a personal situation if I'd be

6553.26 --> 6557.219
dealing with the [ __ ] troll or

6555.36 --> 6559.5
somebody keeps whining making soccer

6557.219 --> 6562.86
yeah then I will get dark but it's

6559.5 --> 6565.08
because I'm just I have a direct reason

6562.86 --> 6566.699
that is right there

6565.08 --> 6571.1
and then the dynamic is different

6566.699 --> 6571.099999999999
because it's now a social interaction

6571.139 --> 6574.28
it has a reason

6577.98 --> 6580.699
foreign

6586.46 --> 6591.06
yeah yeah

6588.48 --> 6593.54

6591.06 --> 6593.54
in there

all these services

7035.599 --> 7040.28

illegal conspiracy

7112.82 --> 7115.54
unfortunately

7115.94 --> 7120.638999999999
I guess it takes out 1 11th

7126.56 --> 7132.34
transfer fee yeah it is no it is the

7128.96 --> 7132.34
sender's fee it's like

7132.8 --> 7138.619000000001
that you have the the

7135.38 --> 7140.78
there's no cost for changing it from

dollars into euros it's just a price

7140.78 --> 7148.159
differential

7142.4 --> 7150.759999999999

I think if we might risk never being

7221.659 --> 7224.92
able to stop ever again

7355.76 --> 7361.900000000001
be able to sell it for a profit

7359.0 --> 7361.9

damn it

7420.86 --> 7425.659
so it's the last of the rookola

7423.92 --> 7427.52
you really have to eat through that

7425.659 --> 7431.199
quickly I guess you just leave it out a

7427.52 --> 7431.1990000000005
few days and it's all snot

7434.54 --> 7437.199
wait what

7453.619 --> 7459.32
what I don't remember what I was saying

7457.36 --> 7461.739
the rose I don't know what you're

7459.32 --> 7461.739
talking about

7466.639 --> 7468.639
okay

7479.0 --> 7485.0
when will I set up a Discord uh

7483.739 --> 7487.638999999999
thank you

7485.0 --> 7489.82
I'm mostly just leaning on Skype at the

7487.639 --> 7489.82
moment

7494.96 --> 7499.46
but I don't know it might be handy if I

7497.239 --> 7501.799999999999
could have like a g plus system because

7499.46 --> 7505.96
G Plus system does seem to be very

7501.8 --> 7505.96
useful and stable

7514.219 --> 7516.9

full of purple little flowers Lila

7557.0 --> 7560.619
purple Lila flowers

7566.54 --> 7570.5

7568.639 --> 7573.04

7623.9 --> 7629.54
scale of the drawing the pseudo photos

7626.42 --> 7631.639
are of Earth are assumed elected from

7629.54 --> 7635.0
the mood yeah but you do know why they

7631.639 --> 7637.46
do that though right I mean

7635.0 --> 7640.52
they just wanted the Earth to look

7637.46 --> 7643.36
exactly like the Moon

7640.52 --> 7643.360000000001
from the Moon

7643.699 --> 7648.259999999999
it couldn't really be bigger

7646.28 --> 7651.099
it would have felt they just wanted to

7648.26 --> 7651.099
mimic the feel

7652.52 --> 7657.7390000000005
right you got to realize that they were

7654.5 --> 7661.04
playing on senses like it's an alien

7657.739 --> 7663.259999999999
situation and besides like how big

7661.04 --> 7667.159
things seem

7663.26 --> 7668.84
at any spot out there is always going to

7667.159 --> 7671.119
be like up for it they could always say

7668.84 --> 7673.099
like no no no it is supposed to look

7671.119 --> 7675.619
smaller

7673.099 --> 7677.84
it's because of some weird lunar

7675.619 --> 7680.78
refraction or something right it doesn't

7677.84 --> 7683.719
matter it only thing that matters is how

7680.78 --> 7685.159
does it influence your subconscious

7683.719 --> 7688.36
perception

7685.159 --> 7691.4
when your com subconscious tries to

7688.36 --> 7694.219
compare it

7691.4 --> 7696.619
with other things like how it is on

7694.219 --> 7698.42
earth when you see the Moon

7696.619 --> 7700.598999999999
and they just wanted to mirror that

7698.42 --> 7700.599
effect

7700.76 --> 7704.360000000001
the subconscious perception effects so

7702.98 --> 7706.159
it's like wow you're standing on the

7704.36 --> 7707.9
moon looking at the Earth it just looks

7706.159 --> 7709.4
just like when you're standing on the

7707.9 --> 7712.659
earth and looking at the moon that's

7709.4 --> 7712.659
what they wanted to achieve

[Music]

7715.94 --> 7717.94

7726.5 --> 7729.099

what is this

7741.38 --> 7748.78
selfie and shows images of the earth and

7743.96 --> 7748.78
all of the most significant oh fine

7749.84 --> 7754.06
it's not like I muted the page

7755.599 --> 7758.32
okay

7759.08 --> 7761.5599999999995
what

7769.639 --> 7776.0
that's supposedly a moon photo Derek

7773.659 --> 7778.4
really

7776.0 --> 7781.159
that's that's a photo of Earth from the

7778.4 --> 7783.0199999999995
Moon according to the Indian space

7783.02 --> 7785.9800000000005
wow

7786.199 --> 7795.199
I guess the Earth really is pear-shaped

7789.26 --> 7798.04
now as in like an a long pair

7795.199 --> 7798.04
what the hell

7828.679 --> 7834.099
what

7831.02 --> 7834.099
are you talking about

7844.94 --> 7848.919999999999
wait what that

7849.02 --> 7852.02
no

7853.4 --> 7859.119
no no no no

7855.04 --> 7862.48
they can't be serious

they are

they are original that

now you sound like a kumu virus that's

7881.119 --> 7885.38
talking about

7882.56 --> 7887.320000000001
straight line aside In that numpty clip

7885.38 --> 7890.96
from QE

7887.32 --> 7892.94
what the hell that's ridiculous man they

7890.96 --> 7899.179
actually saying that

7892.94 --> 7902.299999999999
no just no India no I mean this is like

7899.179 --> 7905.4400000000005
Darth Vader no at this point like what

7902.3 --> 7905.4400000000005
the [ __ ] are you doing

7907.699 --> 7913.699
this

7909.92 --> 7917.96
I mean it probably is but that doesn't

7913.699 --> 7920.5599999999995
compart with Elio's interested

7917.96 --> 7920.56
what

7924.08 --> 7927.26
the Moon is smaller than the satellite

7926.119 --> 7929.839999999999
yeah well

7927.26 --> 7932.719
according to that

7929.84 --> 7934.110000000001
footage apparently

7932.719 --> 7937.27
what

7934.11 --> 7937.2699999999995
[Music]

7955.659 --> 7963.699
objects look smaller in the distance

7958.94 --> 7963.699
uh yeah but wasn't the moon like

7964.46 --> 7969.32
a quarter of the size of Earth or

7967.34 --> 7973.639
something in radius

7969.32 --> 7978.82
I mean how could it be

7973.639 --> 7980.619
in front of Earth and then be like

7978.82 --> 7984.38
150th

7980.619 --> 7988.04
100th of the size no

7984.38 --> 7990.86
there's literally no possible mechanics

7988.04 --> 7995.079
even freaky black hole space-time

7990.86 --> 7995.079
warping that could justify that [ __ ]

8010.84 --> 8016.360000000001
it's

8012.36 --> 8019.299999999999
also really far away behind what the

8016.36 --> 8022.119
[ __ ] are you talking about

8019.3 --> 8025.8
it's not behind the Earth

8022.119 --> 8025.799999999999
it's in front of it

8026.199 --> 8029.82
that's in front of Earth

8035.56 --> 8038.34
what the [ __ ]

8043.0 --> 8049.36
or or do you really think that the Earth

8045.4 --> 8051.46
has this shape I mean

8049.36 --> 8054.579
just looking at one side I'm just being

8051.46 --> 8056.26
like circularly consistent and I would

8054.579 --> 8058.299999999999
have to conclude that the Earth is in

8056.26 --> 8059.7390000000005
this footage is not exactly at the

8058.3 --> 8063.04
center of the screen

8059.739 --> 8065.5
but you can't seriously say that

8063.04 --> 8068.32
the Earth is this kind of shape and that

8065.5 --> 8071.88
the Moon is on that side there's no way

8068.32 --> 8071.88
that's just ridiculous

8073.119 --> 8077.92
it has to be in front of it but that

8075.4 --> 8079.48
makes no sense but

8077.92 --> 8082.119
I mean

8079.48 --> 8084.218999999999
I mean my ball win is getting seriously

8082.119 --> 8087.78
frustrated at this point I'm starting to

8084.219 --> 8087.78
get really annoyed with this [ __ ]

8089.34 --> 8095.59
why why are you doing that

8092.4 --> 8095.589999999999
[Music]

8133.239 --> 8139.178999999999
my goodness I'm talking about

8136.9 --> 8141.94
we're given this picture it's a picture

8139.179 --> 8144.219
that's supposed to be heliocentric so

8141.94 --> 8146.619
I'm gonna look at it from a heliocentric

8144.219 --> 8149.44
perspective original D Rose

8146.619 --> 8152.44
because of course there's absolutely no

8149.44 --> 8156.159
point of considering any of it

8152.44 --> 8158.079
when you know it's trickery so

8156.159 --> 8159.879999999999
but I'm just looking at it from a

8158.079 --> 8162.099
baller's perspective and it's like what

8159.88 --> 8164.38
the [ __ ] are you doing

8162.099 --> 8166.679
why do you keep [ __ ] things up so

8164.38 --> 8166.679
badly

8168.219 --> 8174.54
why do you always have to make things

8170.56 --> 8174.54
worse every [ __ ] thing you do

8191.76 --> 8200.939
I just want freaking stupid ass space

8195.46 --> 8200.938999999998
agencies to stop [ __ ] it up

8201.88 --> 8204.779999999999
like stop

8207.82 --> 8212.859
can't we just like

8210.099 --> 8216.639000000001
negate all these [ __ ] space agencies

8212.859 --> 8220.599
and just instead of give their budget to

8216.639 --> 8222.58
like the original movie making Guild or

8220.599 --> 8225.58
something just so that they can actually

8222.58 --> 8227.979
make movies in which it will look the

8225.58 --> 8232.899
way it's supposed to look instead of

8227.979 --> 8235.599
this crap it's crap it looks so [ __ ]

8232.899 --> 8238.119999999999
ugly and fake

8235.599 --> 8242.019
like even if you're a hardcore believer

8238.12 --> 8244.42
it must be painful to sit through that

8242.019 --> 8247.42
because it's so [ __ ] broken what they

8244.42 --> 8249.639
present every time and it gets worse it

8247.42 --> 8253.2
gets [ __ ] worse it doesn't get better

8249.639 --> 8253.199999999999
it gets worse

an oval Earth

8297.28 --> 8303.04
with a micro Moon supposedly beside or

8300.58 --> 8305.139
behind it doesn't make any sense if you

8303.04 --> 8308.099
believe that you are going to die by

8305.139 --> 8308.098999999998
being euthanized

nobody can be that stupid and not become

by Eugenics it's impossible you will be

euthanized if you believe that is real

who's of the system playing at this

Eugenics if they spot you trying to

explain how that is real to them

8338.2 --> 8343.359
not as a joke they will put you on a

8346.599 --> 8351.58
they will do that

8351.58 --> 8355.019
enough to actually take it

8700.72 --> 8707.34
it's Global dictate GED yeah yeah it's

8704.62 --> 8707.34
great isn't it

8709.479 --> 8712.5
that's good stuff

8713.5 --> 8718.359
and just imagine like how early this was

8716.26 --> 8719.62
it just came out of nowhere like years

8718.359 --> 8722.26
ago

8719.62 --> 8726.479000000001
very early on when like Flat Earth

8722.26 --> 8726.479
debate was really much more obscure

8727.06 --> 8729.84
very cool

8737.319 --> 8743.14
what the hell

8740.14 --> 8745.38
yeah that sounds really gross original D

8773.92 --> 8776.399

8777.82 --> 8780.958999999999
[Music]

8784.06 --> 8787.779999999999
whoa

8785.859 --> 8790.08
already been going almost two and a half

8787.78 --> 8790.08
hours

8808.12 --> 8812.92
I can't believe that India is actually

8810.34 --> 8815.62
doing this supposed Sun Mission and do

8812.92 --> 8816.76
they actually intend to land on on the

8815.62 --> 8818.800000000001
Sun

8816.76 --> 8821.5
did they say that or they just want to

8818.8 --> 8824.64
orbit the Sun or something or [ __ ]

8821.5 --> 8824.64
shitty like that

8824.8 --> 8830.979
did anybody read into it

8828.28 --> 8834.1
I mean it's just you can't seriously go

8830.979 --> 8839.34
like yay we are landing on the sun whoa

8834.1 --> 8839.34
we did it it's like what the [ __ ] man

8852.22 --> 8858.42
yeah he's a guy original D Rose

8856.18 --> 8861.66
106 is a guy

8858.42 --> 8861.66
Boomer guy

8864.18 --> 8869.819
that that's on that night so they don't

8867.1 --> 8869.819
burn up

8875.5 --> 8878.5
just

8904.42 --> 8909.52
I mean

8906.7 --> 8910.6
is there anybody in India that's like

8909.52 --> 8912.58
above

8910.6 --> 8914.56
three years old

8912.58 --> 8917.76
that actually

8914.56 --> 8917.76
buys that [ __ ]

8918.7 --> 8924.0
that actually believe that they're gonna

8920.68 --> 8924.0
land on the sun like

8926.439 --> 8932.380000000001
did

8928.78 --> 8935.140000000001
you it's not supposed to be possible it

8932.38 --> 8936.64
doesn't make [ __ ] sense if it's gonna

8935.14 --> 8939.34
happen then

8936.64 --> 8941.8
well then our complete understanding of

8939.34 --> 8944.64
the heliocentric model is completely

8941.8 --> 8947.74
changed because apparently it's not a

8944.64 --> 8950.199999999999
fiery furnace it's more like it's giant

8947.74 --> 8952.859
heat lamp and it's not that bad when

8950.2 --> 8956.560000000001
you're up dude they'd have to like

8952.859 --> 8958.42
rearrange things so badly man people

8956.56 --> 8961.24
will lose

8958.42 --> 8964.56
folk like even the heliocentris will

8961.24 --> 8969.1
just get so [ __ ] confused

8964.56 --> 8971.399
they can't it's so why why do you do

8969.1 --> 8971.399000000001
that

8974.56 --> 8978.519999999999
stop being a party pooper and come to

8977.26 --> 8980.859
the Sun

8978.52 --> 8983.460000000001
okay Richard Cheese

8980.859 --> 8983.460000000001
God

8985.24 --> 8988.8
why are they doing this

8991.67 --> 8994.829
[Music]

8998.62 --> 9001.62
why

9023.1 --> 9028.08
okay

9024.319 --> 9030.26
that sounds very tedious how unlucky of

9028.08 --> 9030.26
you

9031.08 --> 9035.22
and it is complete retardation indeed

9033.72 --> 9038.66
because that's already officially

9035.22 --> 9038.66
happened and it wasn't a problem

9047.16 --> 9052.439
it was all ruined yeah it's already

9049.859 --> 9055.62
happened it didn't ruin anything it's

9052.439 --> 9059.58
like whoa what do you do when there's a

9055.62 --> 9062.899000000001
hole well there's a hole

9059.58 --> 9062.899
like they don't care

9088.2 --> 9092.960000000001
good point there Richard details yeah

9096.18 --> 9102.42
yeah they do do that don't they

9098.939 --> 9104.880000000001
they like to insert drama

9102.42 --> 9107.399
to try to like have the drama

9104.88 --> 9110.58
seriousness like

9107.399 --> 9114.24
make the nonsense slip by you get

9110.58 --> 9116.64
distracted by the the drama [ __ ]

9114.24 --> 9119.16
so that you take

9116.64 --> 9120.96
the heliocentric mechanics and all that

9119.16 --> 9124.26
for the what they're showing you is

9120.96 --> 9126.979
supposed to be happening for granted

9124.26 --> 9126.979
indeed

9132.06 --> 9135.06
foreign

9139.08 --> 9142.16
yeah it's a good one

9150.96 --> 9156.479
it's it's funny too because there's like

9153.72 --> 9158.519999999999
some women that do that that I've

9156.479 --> 9160.619999999999
experienced in the past

9158.52 --> 9163.02
it's like you go somewhere and then

9160.62 --> 9164.76
something like happens a woman

9163.02 --> 9165.960000000001
recognizes it

9164.76 --> 9168.18
and like

9165.96 --> 9171.479
like nose for example that something is

9168.18 --> 9173.64
happening that's gonna really get the

9171.479 --> 9175.019999999999
husband angry not because of their

9173.64 --> 9177.119999999999
personal fault

9175.02 --> 9180.060000000001
and then they will just like oh

9177.12 --> 9183.060000000001
certainly super distract stuff

9180.06 --> 9186.119999999999
just to get them away

9183.06 --> 9188.58
from from catching on to that situation

9186.12 --> 9192.18
that will really piss them off

9188.58 --> 9193.08
and that it works it actually works that

9192.18 --> 9195.12
stuff

9193.08 --> 9196.38
it's fun it's funny how that works but

9195.12 --> 9198.660000000002
it does

9196.38 --> 9201.358999999999
and I guess that they try to do that

9198.66 --> 9202.8
with the space sci-fi stuff too it's

9201.359 --> 9204.6
like something

9202.8 --> 9206.819
would be like

9204.6 --> 9209.76
catching your attention like hey is that

9206.819 --> 9212.399
really how it would work but don't they

9209.76 --> 9215.34
just make something Dramatical happen or

9212.399 --> 9218.699999999999
some personal emotional struggle

9215.34 --> 9220.8
so that you just don't hook on to the

9218.7 --> 9223.439
actual mechanical detail

9220.8 --> 9226.858999999999
and just let that slip by

9223.439 --> 9230.460000000001
while getting caught up in the drama

9226.859 --> 9234.84
it's so funny how that works

9230.46 --> 9240.259999999998
like pulling their blouse up well

9234.84 --> 9240.26
that yeah that could work I guess

9289.86 --> 9294.479000000001
[Music]

9291.479 --> 9294.479
foreign

9299.3 --> 9303.679999999998
yeah it doesn't work for all of them

9306.66 --> 9311.76
but like my ex would do stuff like that

9308.939 --> 9314.66
not literally that but

9311.76 --> 9314.66
like that

9348.06 --> 9352.039999999999
um

9349.8 --> 9352.039999999999
foreign

9363.68 --> 9368.720000000001
I think I'm gonna move towards rounding

9366.54 --> 9368.720000000001
out

9372.72 --> 9376.46
I'm gonna go for two and a half hours

9377.16 --> 9380.66
jet slowing down a bit

9381.54 --> 9387.26
I could really use a break and some

9384.06 --> 9387.26
fresh air

9387.68 --> 9392.399
although this works too

9390.06 --> 9395.16
let's just stand outside taking a bunch

9392.399 --> 9397.76
of fresh air for a bit

9395.16 --> 9397.76
all right

9411.62 --> 9416.640000000001
I'm just so impressed by that mint plant

9414.479 --> 9420.8
man

9416.64 --> 9420.8
it's exploded so quickly

9421.56 --> 9424.56
foreign

9452.22 --> 9457.699999999999
enough D Rose

9478.04 --> 9482.240000000002
another question Richard G

9484.14 --> 9489.319
a little Steiner talk the heart is not a

9487.08 --> 9489.319
pump

9495.899 --> 9502.74
I well I've not literally

9498.979 --> 9504.06
read into that exactly but I've heard

9502.74 --> 9506.16
that

9504.06 --> 9508.939
being said like my healer referenced

9506.16 --> 9508.939
that at some point

9509.64 --> 9513.84
like especially when I was like thinking

9512.34 --> 9516.06
that I was having potentially heart

9513.84 --> 9518.34
issues it turned out to rather be like

9516.06 --> 9520.5
shoulder muscles

9518.34 --> 9522.78
they were kind of close to it

9520.5 --> 9524.819
but I was like afraid like oh what if

9522.78 --> 9529.1
the pumping just doesn't and he's like

9524.819 --> 9529.1
yeah yeah no it's not actually that

9532.26 --> 9534.26
um

9550.2 --> 9557.84
Thomas Cohen

9552.439 --> 9557.84
I don't know if I heard of that of him

9561.42 --> 9565.64
okay if it

9563.399 --> 9565.64
foreign

9567.08 --> 9570.8
I definitely know about

9570.84 --> 9576.06
if if he knows Andrew Kaufman then I

9574.14 --> 9579.8
probably do know him that probably

9576.06 --> 9579.8
recognize him when I see him

9581.66 --> 9586.819
I'll send you a part okay cool sure

9701.939 --> 9705.6
ask me

9704.22 --> 9709.46
well you're gonna have to try another

9705.6 --> 9709.460000000001
time because I was running out the show

9715.319 --> 9719.06
could you try again tomorrow

9725.819 --> 9730.1
or like write me an email or something

9730.439 --> 9734.24
how do you see it

9737.16 --> 9741.74
how do I see it see what

9741.899 --> 9746.88
I don't understand the question

9743.46 --> 9750.419999999998
mechanically it's just like yeah

9746.88 --> 9752.699999999999
sure we're flat plane there's electrical

9750.42 --> 9754.68
things involved in everything all of

9752.7 --> 9757.399000000001

9754.68 --> 9757.399
that's it

9830.22 --> 9837.96
ere that's right Richard G dude there's

9833.16 --> 9840.119999999999
our viruses arguably don't exist at all

9837.96 --> 9843.899
difference between virus and cell debris

9840.12 --> 9847.319000000001
no there is no viruses

9843.899 --> 9850.319
viruses are a conjured concept and they

9847.319 --> 9853.68
use cell debris to claim that viruses

9850.319 --> 9854.88
exist they don't at all

9853.68 --> 9858.359
yeah

9854.88 --> 9860.938999999998
there is no viruses viruses is a hundred

9858.359 --> 9864.24
percent science fiction concept the

9860.939 --> 9866.220000000001
entire thing is pure science fiction

9864.24 --> 9867.6
purely conceptual

9866.22 --> 9870.599999999999
foreign

9867.6 --> 9870.6
ever

9877.26 --> 9880.979
happens influence

9879.06 --> 9883.8
yeah

9880.979 --> 9886.619999999999
it's just called being sick

9883.8 --> 9889.019999999999
it's like cleaning up your body

9886.62 --> 9891.6
there is no virus

9889.02 --> 9895.1
they don't exist

9891.6 --> 9898.439
it's just stuff happening in your body

9895.1 --> 9901.819
while it cleans things up

9898.439 --> 9901.819
that's all there is

9903.06 --> 9909.359
there is no thing that comes from the

9906.24 --> 9912.539999999999
outside that makes you sick

9909.359 --> 9914.0
except for poison

9912.54 --> 9916.62
provable

9914.0 --> 9919.14
toxic influence

9916.62 --> 9922.1
that you get through your food your

9919.14 --> 9922.099999999999
water and your breathing

9922.26 --> 9927.66
and the psychological

9924.96 --> 9929.519999999999
toxic burden

9927.66 --> 9931.439
that you might carry whatever you're

9929.52 --> 9933.54
imposing on yourself psychologically

9931.439 --> 9936.62
that's also going to have a negative

9933.54 --> 9936.62
influence on your health

9950.819 --> 9955.019999999999
most epidemiologists finding an

9952.979 --> 9958.64
environmental causation yeah

9955.02 --> 9958.640000000001
because it is

9959.22 --> 9965.46
yeah environmental conditions are the

9962.34 --> 9968.16
independent variable that is where

9965.46 --> 9970.74
the independent variable can actually be

9968.16 --> 9973.2
proven to cause the effect which would

9970.74 --> 9975.66
be the disease

9973.2 --> 9977.76
it's as simple as that

9975.66 --> 9979.38
you can say all kinds of things cause

9977.76 --> 9984.06
whatever

9979.38 --> 9985.679999999998
but when you say environment causes

9984.06 --> 9989.279999999999
disease

9985.68 --> 9993.800000000001
you can actually put that to the test

9989.28 --> 9993.800000000001
and then find that it works every time

10002.78 --> 10009.380000000001
now

10004.24 --> 10012.859

10031.399 --> 10037.58
noticed like oh I'm staying home because

10033.439 --> 10040.399
I'm sick and like oh okay

10037.58 --> 10043.0
you want some vitamin C I gave her some

10040.399 --> 10043.0
vitamin C

10044.479 --> 10049.3
if she didn't have that which was really

10046.46 --> 10049.3
surprising to me

10059.0 --> 10062.72
generate higher temperature to simulate

10061.64 --> 10065.42
fever

10062.72 --> 10067.938999999998
yeah it's all part of the cycle

10065.42 --> 10070.88
yeah the bacteria go there

10067.939 --> 10072.62
to clean things up they're like the SWAT

10070.88 --> 10074.599999999999
teams getting in there

10072.62 --> 10077.060000000001
doing stuff

10074.6 --> 10080.92
then eventually it's like yeah you've

10077.06 --> 10083.84
done your work now you're just creating

10080.92 --> 10087.08
your side toxin it's like you're dumping

10083.84 --> 10089.8
your your junk around

10087.08 --> 10092.899
so you need to get the [ __ ] out again

10089.8 --> 10095.06
and then the fever helps with that The

10092.899 --> 10098.979
Fever is like okay bacteria it's been

10095.06 --> 10098.979
cool now get the [ __ ] out again

10099.62 --> 10102.58
so it's like

10102.8 --> 10108.56
repair the dent or rather like contain

10105.92 --> 10113.6
the damage stop the spreading of the

10108.56 --> 10117.08
damage then clean up the mess

10113.6 --> 10120.2
and then regrow

10117.08 --> 10122.979
if that is even possible that is how it

10120.2 --> 10122.979000000001
always works

10135.68 --> 10142.34
[Music]

10137.6 --> 10144.52
right and those processes like yeah they

10142.34 --> 10148.460000000001
all require

10144.52 --> 10150.62
bacteria and cancer and all these things

10148.46 --> 10153.16
like they are in your body they're there

10150.62 --> 10153.160000000002
it's like

10153.2 --> 10159.140000000001
every time people say like oh diseases

10155.84 --> 10161.06
and cancer it's so we're all gonna die

10159.14 --> 10165.26
out because of that

10161.06 --> 10167.72
and I'm like that's like saying that

10165.26 --> 10170.300000000001
like people in construction it's like

10167.72 --> 10171.92
dude it's the freaking bricks that's the

10170.3 --> 10174.92
problem man

10171.92 --> 10177.5
it's like If Only They

10174.92 --> 10180.14
if only we could ensure that

10177.5 --> 10184.1
construction workers

10180.14 --> 10186.14
would be protected against bricks

10184.1 --> 10188.54
that no bricks

10186.14 --> 10190.819
would be allowed near a construction

10188.54 --> 10193.28
worker then I'm sure there will be less

10190.819 --> 10196.84
accidents like that's that type of

10193.28 --> 10196.84
reasoning right

10197.6 --> 10202.58
the bricks being like bacteria

10200.66 --> 10205.039999999999
it's ridiculous

10202.58 --> 10206.96
you're filled with bacteria when you're

10205.04 --> 10209.479000000001
not filled with bacteria because you

10206.96 --> 10211.699999999999
kill them all for some reason you become

10209.479 --> 10214.3
less healthy

10211.7 --> 10214.300000000001
fact

10216.08 --> 10221.68
you need to bacteria

10218.6 --> 10224.380000000001
to process certain types of

10221.68 --> 10226.939
environmental poison

10224.38 --> 10229.279999999999
when you then get rid of the bacteria

10226.939 --> 10231.439
but your environmental situation doesn't

10229.28 --> 10233.66
change and you still get the poison well

10231.439 --> 10236.300000000001
guess what those bacteria in processing

10233.66 --> 10238.42
that poison no more and now you actually

10236.3 --> 10242.899
get poisoned

10238.42 --> 10244.66
uh uh didn't think about that did you

10242.899 --> 10247.64
yeah that's why people that are

10244.66 --> 10250.939
germophobic and continually wrap their

10247.64 --> 10253.64
hands in alcohol yeah that's why they

10250.939 --> 10254.720000000001
get sick from everything

10253.64 --> 10257.479
yeah

10254.72 --> 10261.56
that's why you get sick all the time

10257.479 --> 10264.5
it's because you're attacking the things

10261.56 --> 10267.859
that are actually helping you

10264.5 --> 10271.54
because you've had this irrational fear

10267.859 --> 10275.42
image imposed upon you about these

10271.54 --> 10279.68
Outsider micro Invaders and it's all for

10275.42 --> 10282.52
[ __ ] it's all witchcraft fear porn

10279.68 --> 10282.52
it is

10284.06 --> 10292.66
can prove bacteria cause disease Cox

10288.1 --> 10292.66
postulate is never applied

10293.02 --> 10298.52
himself never successfully applied his

10296.899 --> 10301.22
postulate

10298.52 --> 10303.08
he just designed the postulate

10301.22 --> 10305.599999999999
and everybody thought yeah that makes

10303.08 --> 10308.24
perfect sense and then nobody ever

10305.6 --> 10310.28
[ __ ] actually did it this was just

10308.24 --> 10312.8
assumed that that's how it all works

10310.28 --> 10315.439
it's like you're just gonna assume

10312.8 --> 10318.8
that bacteria cause this because we find

10315.439 --> 10320.6
them and cause partial at once he once

10318.8 --> 10322.039999999999
claimed that it worked and then he did

10320.6 --> 10323.84
an experiment or something and then it

10322.04 --> 10326.54
works and then they don't keep track of

10323.84 --> 10330.439
how it was all a fraud when the actual

10326.54 --> 10332.0
experiment setup was a fraud and that's

10330.439 --> 10334.220000000001
never admitted so it's just always

10332.0 --> 10337.46
assumed that he was right and now we got

10334.22 --> 10340.64
an entire medical industry based on this

10337.46 --> 10344.179999999998
false premise assumption

10340.64 --> 10349.46
of the microorganism known as bacteria

10344.18 --> 10352.939
yeah it's a gigantic Monumental fraud as

10349.46 --> 10355.278999999999
big as outer space itself

10352.939 --> 10357.460000000001
yeah you're I'm that's exactly what it

10355.279 --> 10357.460000000001
is

10357.819 --> 10364.64
bacteria microorganisms

10360.979 --> 10365.979
being like hostile Invaders that you

10364.64 --> 10370.939
need to

10365.979 --> 10373.58
defend against with chemicals is as big

10370.939 --> 10374.899
a lie as that the Earth is a ball and

10373.58 --> 10378.14
that there's such a thing as outer space

10374.899 --> 10379.699999999999
it's just as Monumental and just as

10378.14 --> 10382.519999999999
radical

10379.7 --> 10384.560000000001
as what it does psychologically to

10382.52 --> 10386.359
people where it has brought people

10384.56 --> 10388.34
psychologically you know where is Broad

10386.359 --> 10391.52
people psychologically

10388.34 --> 10395.12
is brought people psychologically to

10391.52 --> 10399.439
trust blindly for their health in

10395.12 --> 10402.68
doctors and then when they're asked to

10399.439 --> 10406.04
have unknown [ __ ] injected into them

10402.68 --> 10408.02
that can literally kill them and they

10406.04 --> 10412.76
wouldn't even know and they'll still do

10408.02 --> 10415.76
it yeah that's what it brought Humanity

10412.76 --> 10418.7
to and now we're picking the fruits of

10415.76 --> 10420.02
that the fruits of death

10418.7 --> 10423.02
thanks

10420.02 --> 10426.08
thanks bacteria Theory

10423.02 --> 10429.439
thanks a lot germ Theory

10426.08 --> 10431.6
for just being presupposed never

10429.439 --> 10432.859
actually having been tested through

10431.6 --> 10435.02
experiment

10432.859 --> 10437.479000000001
yet the entire medical industry is like

10435.02 --> 10441.140000000001
one of the biggest invested industries

10437.479 --> 10444.619999999999
of all time all based on the false

10441.14 --> 10448.3
premise that bacteria are invading

10444.62 --> 10451.7
entities for over a hundred years

10448.3 --> 10454.399
absorbing more money than or equal

10451.7 --> 10456.380000000001
amounts of money as the American defense

10454.399 --> 10461.358999999999
budget

10456.38 --> 10464.96
it's it's all so [ __ ] up guys

10461.359 --> 10467.479000000001
the lies are so monumental

10464.96 --> 10470.119999999999
so much money

10467.479 --> 10472.46
I mean

10470.12 --> 10477.08
the medical industry what it's become

10472.46 --> 10480.019999999999
will make like Babylonian priesthoods

10477.08 --> 10483.08
like if they'd ever get to see what what

10480.02 --> 10486.74
medical industry does now they'll blush

10483.08 --> 10488.96
in shame of like Jesus

10486.74 --> 10493.0
oh

10488.96 --> 10493.0
that that's what they do

10493.16 --> 10497.539999999999
that's how Babylonian priests would

10496.34 --> 10500.72
respond

10497.54 --> 10503.300000000001
to the modern medical industry

10500.72 --> 10505.699999999999
they would be freaked out

10503.3 --> 10507.14
while they are professional mind

10505.7 --> 10509.300000000001
controllers

10507.14 --> 10511.16
they always were the Babylonian priest

10509.3 --> 10514.819
that's what that's the special date

10511.16 --> 10517.52
shame and cower in the face of realizing

10514.819 --> 10521.68
how this medical industry works yeah

10517.52 --> 10521.68
that's how bad it really is

10525.08 --> 10527.62
okay

10534.58 --> 10540.62
between asymptomatic clinical

10537.02 --> 10543.439
colonization and infection exactly yeah

10540.62 --> 10546.26
because it is completely different

10543.439 --> 10547.76
having a bunch of bacteria on a petri

10546.26 --> 10550.16
dish do stuff

10547.76 --> 10553.76
versus a body

10550.16 --> 10556.52
is completely different

10553.76 --> 10557.66
you can't barely compare it

10556.52 --> 10560.6
I mean

10557.66 --> 10566.5
what you say asymptomatic clinical

10560.6 --> 10566.5
colonization is barely even useful

10567.08 --> 10570.1
for research

10571.46 --> 10578.419999999998
I mean it would be useful to I don't

10575.0 --> 10580.7
know apply cause postulate yeah so you

10578.42 --> 10582.74
could isolate

10580.7 --> 10584.68
the bacteria

10582.74 --> 10588.26
so you could

10584.68 --> 10593.84
isolate it without junk

10588.26 --> 10599.62
put it in or on the test subject to see

10593.84 --> 10602.42
whether it causes the disease

10599.62 --> 10605.560000000001
like actually scientifically proving it

10602.42 --> 10605.56
causes it yeah

10606.02 --> 10608.2
foreign

10636.42 --> 10641.29
[Music]

10651.939 --> 10657.92
totally right

10654.62 --> 10660.68
the only reason why they even have some

10657.92 --> 10663.56
sort of claim to bacteria causing

10660.68 --> 10666.460000000001
disease now is because they can prove

10663.56 --> 10669.08
that those bacteria exert certain toxins

10666.46 --> 10672.019999999999
which will

10669.08 --> 10675.08
scientifically provable lead to certain

10672.02 --> 10678.02
symptoms that are then associated with

10675.08 --> 10680.12
the entire disease and that's how they

10678.02 --> 10682.04
then conclude that those bacteria cause

10680.12 --> 10685.58
that disease because they exert certain

10682.04 --> 10687.740000000002
toxins that typically cause the

10685.58 --> 10690.62
associated symptom and that's how they

10687.74 --> 10693.439
then conclude that it causes it

10690.62 --> 10696.160000000002
never actually proven it they just have

10693.439 --> 10696.16
a correlation

10698.84 --> 10703.24
and that's the medical industry that's

10700.7 --> 10703.240000000002
what they do

10717.8 --> 10722.92
we know they exist because we make

10719.84 --> 10722.92
vaccines out of this

10724.76 --> 10726.76
yeah

10727.06 --> 10732.519999999999
unfortunately it has come to that indeed

10740.12 --> 10742.6
together

10748.04 --> 10752.12
it's already been isolow really when

10750.74 --> 10755.0
where

10752.12 --> 10758.779
who did the test who was the scientist

10755.0 --> 10760.16
that did the actual experiment where is

10758.779 --> 10763.58
the data

10760.16 --> 10765.92
part the raw data published from the

10763.58 --> 10769.399
results of his experiment where's his

10765.92 --> 10772.34
report and the date

10769.399 --> 10773.18
and the sourcing for his samples where

10772.34 --> 10779.06
is it

10773.18 --> 10781.7
oh nobody ever has that oh

10779.06 --> 10785.14
wow I'll be

10781.7 --> 10785.140000000001
who could have thought that

10789.56 --> 10794.778999999999
fungi and parasites exist yeah well

10791.899 --> 10797.479
bacteria exists too it's just that fungi

10794.779 --> 10800.779
and parasites can actually be proven

10797.479 --> 10803.06
through cost postulate to cause certain

10800.779 --> 10805.960000000001
diseases directly through the

10803.06 --> 10805.96
introduction of them

10807.92 --> 10813.08
that's the difference

10810.08 --> 10816.02
see why do we know fungi and parasites

10813.08 --> 10818.3
do act do actually cause disease well

10816.02 --> 10819.92
because well when they're introduced

10818.3 --> 10821.0
well they guess what they cause the

10819.92 --> 10822.859
disease

10821.0 --> 10827.479
it's just provable through cost

10822.859 --> 10831.26
postulate yeah the same doesn't count

10827.479 --> 10833.72
for bacteria or viruses and with

10831.26 --> 10836.18
bacteria well there are other scenarios

10833.72 --> 10838.22
right like you can weaponize bacteria

10836.18 --> 10840.979000000001
what that means is you expose the

10838.22 --> 10843.56
bacteria in laboratory conditions to

10840.979 --> 10845.08
more and more hostile influences to more

10843.56 --> 10849.199999999999
toxic environment

10845.08 --> 10852.2
bacteria will adapt and become more

10849.2 --> 10854.54
aggressive in its local actions

10852.2 --> 10856.279
because it's surrounded by dangerous

10854.54 --> 10857.779
influence it will become dangerous it

10856.279 --> 10860.2
will become aggressive if it's then

10857.779 --> 10862.279
introduced in a

10860.2 --> 10864.62
biological environment it will like

10862.279 --> 10866.359
directly start attacking

10864.62 --> 10870.08
the environment why does it do that

10866.359 --> 10873.5
because it's it is trying to rob

10870.08 --> 10876.5
the environment of certain nutritions

10873.5 --> 10879.5
that it will need to get rid of the

10876.5 --> 10881.899
toxic [ __ ] that has been subjected to in

10879.5 --> 10884.3
order to become that aggressive so the

10881.899 --> 10887.0
bacteria could literally be explained to

10884.3 --> 10888.819
literally go around to try to snatch the

10887.0 --> 10891.26
resources it needs to get back to normal

10888.819 --> 10894.08
that's what an aggressive bacteria

10891.26 --> 10899.439
probably most likely is

10894.08 --> 10902.24
see but they always stop being like that

10899.439 --> 10906.880000000001
once you make it a bacteria aggressive

10902.24 --> 10909.859
they never stay aggressive

10906.88 --> 10912.56
unless they just stay in the toxic

10909.859 --> 10914.12
environment but yeah that's not where a

10912.56 --> 10915.74
living organism is going to be if it's

10914.12 --> 10919.160000000002
going to be inserted in a living

10915.74 --> 10921.26
organism guess what it's gonna adapt and

10919.16 --> 10924.74
then it's gonna go back to the more

10921.26 --> 10927.34
normal Cooperative state of the bacteria

10924.74 --> 10930.92
and not be aggressive anymore because

10927.34 --> 10933.08
it's no longer toxic it got the

10930.92 --> 10936.7
resources it needed to have a normal

10933.08 --> 10939.56
function it can adapt it can

10936.7 --> 10942.800000000001
work with the body again

10939.56 --> 10944.778999999999
become part of the body even

10942.8 --> 10946.58
become part of the bloodstream transform

10944.779 --> 10948.62
into something else like in a blood

10946.58 --> 10952.64
platelet bacteria can transform into

10948.62 --> 10954.979000000001
blood platelets yeah it's on record

10952.64 --> 10957.56
that that's possible

10954.979 --> 10959.599999999999
so bacteria are part of the body they

10957.56 --> 10961.64
can adapt they can be made hostile

10959.6 --> 10963.859
through toxic influence but then as soon

10961.64 --> 10966.08
as you introduce them in the body yeah

10963.859 --> 10968.720000000001
they might do some damage and guess what

10966.08 --> 10971.42
over just a few

10968.72 --> 10973.399
periods of time it's no longer

10971.42 --> 10975.8
aggressive as a bacteria

10973.399 --> 10978.38
and it becomes a simulated part of your

10975.8 --> 10981.14
body it literally that same bacteria

10978.38 --> 10984.08
that did some damage a few Generations

10981.14 --> 10986.24
which happens very quickly after because

10984.08 --> 10987.14
it procreates quickly in the body and

10986.24 --> 10989.66
then

10987.14 --> 10992.42
it's no longer aggressive now you have

10989.66 --> 10996.939
that bacteria in your body it's your

10992.42 --> 10999.8
bacteria that bacteria works for you now

10996.939 --> 11001.06
that's how it really works

10999.8 --> 11005.08
yeah

11001.06 --> 11008.56
bacteria are our workers all of them

11005.08 --> 11011.2
all of them

11008.56 --> 11013.3
there is no oh only these bacteria for

11011.2 --> 11015.34
us and those bacteria never for us now

11013.3 --> 11018.22
that doesn't exist

11015.34 --> 11021.76
all bacteria

11018.22 --> 11023.858999999999
but some bacteria have like are used to

11021.76 --> 11026.62
very toxic environments and well when

11023.859 --> 11029.68
they're like that when they're when

11026.62 --> 11032.02
they're only adapted to toxic conditions

11029.68 --> 11035.460000000001
well then you shouldn't introduce them

11032.02 --> 11035.460000000001
to your body yeah

11038.2 --> 11042.640000000001
because then they you get the aggression

11040.6 --> 11045.06
because they're toxic they're used to

11042.64 --> 11047.858999999999
toxic environment but if you have

11045.06 --> 11050.68
detoxed bacteria

11047.859 --> 11053.76
they don't have that issue your body can

11050.68 --> 11053.76
just assimilate them

11062.8 --> 11065.099999999999
foreign

11070.02 --> 11075.16
talking about this subject right away

11072.76 --> 11078.18
is very important because

11075.16 --> 11083.58
the medical system has been mesmerizing

11078.18 --> 11083.58
Western Society for over a hundred years

11083.62 --> 11092.740000000002
arguably over 130 years maybe even more

11089.14 --> 11094.96
and there is a better way to make sense

11092.74 --> 11097.0
of how things work and I'm working on it

11094.96 --> 11099.58
and I'm trying to explain what I've

11097.0 --> 11101.62
learned thus far and I'm very sure that

11099.58 --> 11103.779
I'm on point I'm willing to risk

11101.62 --> 11106.479000000001
actually

11103.779 --> 11108.899000000001
doing some of these things just to prove

11106.479 --> 11108.899
my case

11110.439 --> 11112.979000000001
right

11116.5 --> 11121.02
just like that guy that was willing to

11119.5 --> 11123.939
prove that

11121.02 --> 11125.92
radioactive material is not as dangerous

11123.939 --> 11128.56
as it is made out to be

11125.92 --> 11131.8
by literally swallowing it

11128.56 --> 11135.64
in full confidence it's like

11131.8 --> 11137.74
that is what I'm willing with where I'm

11135.64 --> 11140.68
willing to go when it comes to proving

11137.74 --> 11142.899
my model

11140.68 --> 11145.960000000001
for bacterial life

11142.899 --> 11147.88
and and it combined with the rest of

11145.96 --> 11151.419999999998
life I'm willing to actually undergo

11147.88 --> 11154.358999999999
these [ __ ] postulate tests it's like oh

11151.42 --> 11156.6
really so good luck infecting me I mean

11154.359 --> 11159.880000000001
go ahead

11156.6 --> 11163.899000000001
as long as you isolate the bacteria yeah

11159.88 --> 11165.819
it's just pure bacteria no residue no

11163.899 --> 11168.88
other stuff

11165.819 --> 11170.979
and prove it prove to me that I will get

11168.88 --> 11173.259999999998
sick from that bacteria

11170.979 --> 11175.858999999999
I'd be willing to undergo such

11173.26 --> 11175.859
experiment

11175.899 --> 11180.34
just to prove it because I'm that

11177.76 --> 11183.7
certain of my case here I'm not afraid

11180.34 --> 11186.16
of bacteria I'm afraid of toxin

11183.7 --> 11190.859
that's what I'm afraid of not of

11186.16 --> 11190.859
bacteria bacteria are my friends

11191.08 --> 11194.27
[Music]

11195.22 --> 11201.519999999999
yeah and this medical industry to me is

11198.939 --> 11203.92
like there are a bunch of Nazis

11201.52 --> 11206.800000000001
and the bacteria are the Jews and the

11203.92 --> 11209.92
Nazis are just making propaganda up

11206.8 --> 11211.479
about Jews doing this and that causing

11209.92 --> 11214.12
all the problem I mean it's literally

11211.479 --> 11217.179999999998
that the bacteria are the Jews

11214.12 --> 11220.660000000002
and the medical industry is the Nazis

11217.18 --> 11224.02
and they've been persecuting bacteria

11220.66 --> 11224.979
for over a century it's become our

11224.02 --> 11228.1
culture

11224.979 --> 11230.858999999999
even though we are figuring it out

11228.1 --> 11234.06
that it's just not true

11230.859 --> 11234.06
that is propaganda

11238.08 --> 11241.319
[Music]

11244.04 --> 11248.810000000001
[Music]

11256.779 --> 11261.279
yeah bacteria that isn't in one's normal

11259.06 --> 11263.979
flora as it's called yeah that yeah

11261.279 --> 11267.279
there will be a reaction

11263.979 --> 11270.88
but bacteria are gonna duke it out and

11267.279 --> 11272.74
then eventually it will be killed or

11270.88 --> 11275.14
assimilated and then it's part of your

11272.74 --> 11277.84
bacterial Flora

11275.14 --> 11280.18
right it's like the new guy comes in and

11277.84 --> 11282.819
everybody's like oh this is my spot this

11280.18 --> 11284.92
is my spot and you're like duking it out

11282.819 --> 11288.16
and then it's like oh okay we're buddies

11284.92 --> 11291.1
now or it's dead

11288.16 --> 11294.279
that's how bacteria go about

11291.1 --> 11295.54
they'll duke it out until either it's

11294.279 --> 11298.899000000001
dead

11295.54 --> 11301.380000000001
or it's one of the guys

11298.899 --> 11301.38
really

11307.779 --> 11309.84
okay

11311.71 --> 11314.9
[Music]

11315.54 --> 11321.84
u y b y t what what does that mean

11323.68 --> 11328.66
Galen Windsor right

11326.74 --> 11331.119999999999
was that the guy that swallowed the

11328.66 --> 11334.119999999999
Uranium on camera was that Galen winter

11331.12 --> 11337.319000000001
not sure

11334.12 --> 11337.319000000001
and mix the names up

11354.76 --> 11357.76
foreign

11380.14 --> 11386.099999999999
I should probably be rounding out the

11382.54 --> 11386.1
show but it's been really interesting

11386.319 --> 11391.0
of course it's it's way too much subject

11388.96 --> 11393.16
and I'll be able to fit it all in the

11391.0 --> 11395.68
title usually the title is comprised of

11393.16 --> 11398.2
a summary of what happens in the first

11395.68 --> 11400.24
half of the show because the second half

11398.2 --> 11402.16
is just like yeah this is awesome too I

11400.24 --> 11403.779
can't make it fit though it just doesn't

11402.16 --> 11405.7
fit in title

11403.779 --> 11406.899000000001
keeps happening with these three hour

11405.7 --> 11410.29
shows

11406.899 --> 11413.489
hey Supreme knowing good to see you

11410.29 --> 11413.489000000001

11420.9 --> 11424.19
[Music]

11431.439 --> 11436.779
yeah yeah he was the one right

11434.14 --> 11439.119999999999
thanks buddy for telling me

11436.779 --> 11442.12
as I said I'm terrible with names I'll

11439.12 --> 11444.58
I'll mix them up I will I was thinking

11442.12 --> 11446.92
Yuri Batman now but that's not the guy

11444.58 --> 11449.74
that's another guy that

11446.92 --> 11453.69
warned about these basically the

11449.74 --> 11456.749
communist state in America and the West

11453.69 --> 11456.749
[Music]

11463.0 --> 11469.08
glad I was correct the Galen Windsor

11466.42 --> 11469.08
hmm

11469.779 --> 11473.560000000001
yeah

11471.04 --> 11476.220000000001
it was interesting lectures very

11473.56 --> 11476.22
interesting stuff

11489.279 --> 11492.279
hmm

11504.1 --> 11508.06
what are you guys enjoying this uh sure

11506.92 --> 11509.8
you are otherwise you wouldn't be

11508.06 --> 11512.439
hanging around still

11509.8 --> 11515.039999999999
I'm sure enjoying this but I do actually

11512.439 --> 11515.04
gotta

11521.68 --> 11527.800000000001
anyway

11523.5 --> 11530.02
called the other side of AIDS no

11527.8 --> 11533.819
not that I remember but I'm very well

11530.02 --> 11538.5
aware of how it was a scam and what the

11533.819 --> 11538.5
Rendezvous through fauci

11538.66 --> 11543.1
but I haven't watched that original

11540.88 --> 11545.619999999999
documentary now

11543.1 --> 11548.939
I don't remember actually I might have

11545.62 --> 11548.939
watched it and then I didn't remember

11549.24 --> 11552.779
link it up then

11563.2 --> 11568.560000000001
right back all right

11565.54 --> 11572.26
she's a dirty evil bastard

11568.56 --> 11576.24
yeah I mean it's it's just a he's just a

11572.26 --> 11576.24
hangman he's just a medical hangman

11576.46 --> 11582.339999999998
that's what they do

11579.34 --> 11584.8
they're like cleaning up the the ranged

11582.34 --> 11588.54
cattle

11584.8 --> 11588.539999999999
that's kind of how I see them

11589.66 --> 11595.18
they're just tasked with they're like

11592.359 --> 11597.7
The Butchers of the flock

11595.18 --> 11598.960000000001
except they don't actually yield edible

11597.7 --> 11601.18
meat

11598.96 --> 11603.22
but that's their function in the system

11601.18 --> 11605.800000000001
they're just there to kill off those

11603.22 --> 11608.319
that have become deranged enough to be

11605.8 --> 11611.22
able to be killed off easily

11608.319 --> 11611.22
that's what they do

11612.819 --> 11617.8
they actually covered FD time slot

11615.22 --> 11621.479
nicely yeah but that I was planning to

11617.8 --> 11621.479
do that this entire week yeah

11628.54 --> 11633.04
should look into what posterior did

11630.399 --> 11638.319
trying to prove rabies yeah I actually

11633.04 --> 11642.399000000001
yeah but dude he did some crazy crap man

11638.319 --> 11644.319
not even with just rabies just

11642.399 --> 11645.939
like that time when he would literally

11644.319 --> 11649.06
like take

11645.939 --> 11651.64
just a a corpse

11649.06 --> 11653.439
and just take rotting juice from the

11651.64 --> 11655.539999999999
[ __ ] corpse and then inject it to

11653.439 --> 11661.84
proved that it was causing

11655.54 --> 11666.34
disease it's a crazy crazy horror [ __ ]

11661.84 --> 11668.439
like the most horrific scary ass [ __ ]

11666.34 --> 11669.960000000001
injecting it in you is like what the

11668.439 --> 11673.12
[ __ ]

11669.96 --> 11675.699999999999
I mean that's like that happens in

11673.12 --> 11679.08
horror movies

11675.7 --> 11679.08
crazy [ __ ]

11681.46 --> 11687.419999999998
improve the documentary okay

11684.279 --> 11687.42
thanks for the heads up

11687.819 --> 11691.979
one and a half hour Jesus

11693.34 --> 11699.24
okay okay I guess I'll have to watch

11696.34 --> 11699.24
that somewhere

11733.72 --> 11738.34
right anyway I guess I'm gonna just

11735.76 --> 11740.859
watch that then and rounding out the

11738.34 --> 11744.04
show that's gone over three hours

11740.859 --> 11746.02
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

11744.04 --> 11748.479000000001
like this show if you did then please

11746.02 --> 11750.460000000001
don't forget the rogans it up and if you

11748.479 --> 11752.8
haven't already subscribe to my channel

11750.46 --> 11754.839999999998
hit the Bell notification so you know

11752.8 --> 11757.479
when I'm going live which is normally

11754.84 --> 11759.34
1pm Amsterdam time in a weekdays and 2PM

11757.479 --> 11761.38
Amsterdam time in the weekend

11759.34 --> 11763.66
but yeah in this current week I'm

11761.38 --> 11766.479
starting a little later and then

11763.66 --> 11768.819
rounding out the show much later

11766.479 --> 11769.84
because there's no live fed all this

11768.819 --> 11771.58
week

11769.84 --> 11774.04
right

11771.58 --> 11776.439
so yeah please also do support me

11774.04 --> 11778.899000000001
through the PayPal and the patreon that

11776.439 --> 11781.24
would be really appreciated very very

11778.899 --> 11784.0
necessary and I did get some support

11781.24 --> 11785.199999999999

unfortunately but I will keep delivering

11789.34 --> 11793.6
though I mean I hope that you are all

11791.5 --> 11794.979
very happy with these extra long shows

11793.6 --> 11797.439
filling in

11794.979 --> 11799.119999999999
for fed somewhat even though we're not

11797.439 --> 11799.899
really talking about Flat Earth all that

take in the sun while it's still there I

11837.819 --> 11843.84
mean it will probably change around

11840.399 --> 11843.84
pretty suddenly

11844.0 --> 11850.319
after the weekend

11846.34 --> 11850.319
so enjoy it while it's still there

11850.42 --> 11855.64
and make sure you keep hydrated as well

11853.0 --> 11861.72
because you will need it

11855.64 --> 11861.72
and until the next video keep it flat
