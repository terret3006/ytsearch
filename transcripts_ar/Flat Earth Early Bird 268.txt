6.45 --> 40.35
[Music]

36.44 --> 44.73
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.35 --> 45.33
early-bird number one no sorry 268 I'm

44.73 --> 47.459999999999994
your host

45.33 --> 49.349999999999994
Arwen and before we start to show please

47.46 --> 51.69
don't forget to share it on any platform

49.35 --> 53.34
you deem fit and also if you haven't

51.69 --> 54.9
already subscribed to my channel and hit

53.34 --> 56.580000000000005
the bell notification so you know when

54.9 --> 59.19
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

56.58 --> 61.019999999999996
p.m. and so damn time every day also

59.19 --> 62.94
please don't forget to support my

61.02 --> 65.79
channel through the Super chats paypal

62.94 --> 75.05
patreon and my GoFundMe much obliged

65.79 --> 75.05000000000001
so yeah today is a pretty nice day again

76.07 --> 85.38
it's very much like yesterday it's

81.869 --> 89.43
really beautiful clear up yesterday

85.38 --> 94.61
evening was just fantastic like all

89.43 --> 97.95
evening there was this lovely fresh air

94.61 --> 100.86
like it was rich in oxygen I could just

97.95 --> 107.01
literally feel it it was really nice

100.86 --> 109.53
fresh air blowing constantly it was

107.01 --> 112.82000000000001
literally therapeutical to just sit

109.53 --> 117.51
outside and and breathe that all in

112.82 --> 124.47
yesterday so that was awesome and who

117.51 --> 129.72
knows maybe today it'll be the same so I

124.47 --> 132.85
got Tamara coffee and tea and that's it

129.72 --> 134.98
[Music]

132.85 --> 140.93
hmm

134.98 --> 143.81
so it seems when Benjamin has taken down

140.93 --> 147.98000000000002
all of his videos he got a strike for

143.81 --> 152.0
the Boomer video thing and some more and

147.98 --> 155.209
he chose to play scorched earth strategy

152.0 --> 157.04
and just take them all down and I

155.209 --> 159.85
thought oh [ __ ] that means that I can't

157.04 --> 164.44
get any of that anymore and I thought

159.85 --> 167.93
okay let's look at an authorized TV and

164.44 --> 170.12
it says kind of yeah you have to to sign

167.93 --> 172.459
in you have to pay something for a

170.12 --> 175.18
channel but then I figured out you can

172.459 --> 179.53
still just watch it without signing in

175.18 --> 183.8
so I can still watch the Owen Benjamin

179.53 --> 186.2
afterwards I don't know if he if he even

183.8 --> 188.54000000000002
does the actual livestream still on

186.2 --> 195.1
YouTube maybe he did and then I missed

188.54 --> 201.5
it yesterday evening so that happened

195.1 --> 205.43
also yeah this evening hmm quantum

201.5 --> 208.329
eraser is having its premiere as

205.43 --> 211.85
everybody must be knowing by now because

208.329 --> 214.63
being organized effort to spread that

211.85 --> 214.63
video around

215.37 --> 218.529
[Music]

223.74 --> 232.17000000000002
and hmm yeah it feels good it still

228.96 --> 236.28
feels been weird for me too

232.17 --> 238.73999999999998
yeah I don't like uploading videos from

236.28 --> 245.79
other people and mirroring I never like

238.74 --> 249.0
it but I did it this time and we'll see

245.79 --> 252.53
where it goes I do really hope that he

249.0 --> 254.76
does get his own solid base at least and

252.53 --> 257.18
from there on we'll just see what

254.76 --> 257.18
happens

261.79 --> 266.70000000000005
I think it's necessary for this to

264.4 --> 266.7
happen

271.2 --> 283.21
Wow okay well I disagree Jimbo Kahn he's

279.55 --> 289.42
not a [ __ ] but his behavior is

283.21 --> 293.04999999999995
certainly a bit below par I guess

289.42 --> 295.39000000000004
sometimes but no he's definitely not a

293.05 --> 300.61
[ __ ] he's very well studied he has more

295.39 --> 303.78999999999996
answers to complicated questions and

300.61 --> 314.46000000000004
information than a lot of people out

303.79 --> 318.97
there and can't take that yeah you look

314.46 --> 322.59999999999997
it's like a giant and you say a it's a

318.97 --> 325.57000000000005
funny I test your sivan yay you will not

322.6 --> 328.0
be able to handle quantum eraser your

325.57 --> 333.79
ego will make it impossible you for you

328.0 --> 337.33
to focus and you will be bent he'll

333.79 --> 342.25
literally hell-bent literally to attack

337.33 --> 348.49
him because the attitude like like right

342.25 --> 352.0
to hand did all that so yeah you can't

348.49 --> 355.18
be a gamma you can't be a Sivan yay to

352.0 --> 359.88
deal with quantum eraser so maybe it's

355.18 --> 359.88
just a he's a gatekeeper for seven years

360.39 --> 369.03
I'm starting to like him more and more

364.65 --> 373.95
by that standard it's weird how things

369.03 --> 373.95
work out in the play of all things

377.9 --> 385.85999999999996
but like me if you learn to get over

381.24 --> 389.819
that attitude of his and just you can

385.86 --> 393.36
still ask questions and I have done this

389.819 --> 395.43
more than anyone else out there from a

393.36 --> 398.279
neutral standpoint and not some

395.43 --> 400.8
groveling angle because I hate doing

398.279 --> 403.74
that I do like getting patted on the

400.8 --> 405.779
back as a student when I'm learning and

403.74 --> 409.5
then I like to prove that I actually

405.779 --> 411.659
know the things that are discussed but

409.5 --> 414.21
when I have personal genuine questions

411.659 --> 414.96
when I test test the material I am NOT

414.21 --> 419.18899999999996
groveling

414.96 --> 422.60999999999996
I'm literally testing and you can do

419.189 --> 426.65900000000005
that if you do it from the right angle

422.61 --> 428.039
because if you don't test it prepared if

426.659 --> 430.68
you don't actually know what you're

428.039 --> 436.62
talking about yet he's just gonna Walsh

430.68 --> 441.229
all over you and do the whole clown yeah

436.62 --> 444.569
raw pizza thing with you and all that so

441.229 --> 447.81
yeah that's what that's how it works

444.569 --> 448.62
that's how quantum eraser works it's

447.81 --> 453.509
tricky

448.62 --> 455.58
it's a test and it's up to you can you

453.509 --> 458.699
handle it can you handle that attitude

455.58 --> 461.58
and still learn what he has to offer

458.699 --> 464.699
because he does have to offer valuable

461.58 --> 468.659
information and I'm not necessarily

464.699 --> 472.349
talking about his opinions okay I'm

468.659 --> 475.02
talking about what he knows the things

472.349 --> 477.24
that he has read through and learned and

475.02 --> 485.149
compared he has an oversight over things

477.24 --> 485.149
and that is valuable oh God go away

486.559 --> 492.79900000000004
this is this what you've become now

489.349 --> 498.709
conspiracy cats a sock puppet ear

492.799 --> 501.81899999999996
trolling is that what you are now hope

498.709 --> 501.819
you're proud of yourself

515.05 --> 523.7589999999999
so yeah quantum eraser can't live with

520.849 --> 531.1700000000001
them can't live without them but you got

523.759 --> 538.879
to learn or step away so yeah do

531.17 --> 541.7199999999999
subscribe to his channel let's see what

538.879 --> 541.72
else is going on

547.15 --> 554.43
I think I've been browsing through just

551.17 --> 557.86
a lot of news in general and found that

554.43 --> 560.3499999999999
things are not as informative as I would

557.86 --> 565.02
like them to be a lot of distraction

560.35 --> 569.62
factoid articles which is good but still

565.02 --> 572.62
not so much directly with things that

569.62 --> 576.63
are going around but disappointed at

572.62 --> 576.63
that but I'll figure it out

582.529 --> 589.32
anyway let's see who is in chat it's

586.589 --> 592.2790000000001
McLeod was first no wait he wasn't first

589.32 --> 594.089
but he's now showing his first huh nice

592.279 --> 596.399
alright yeah

594.089 --> 603.0
AGM was first and then Steve and then

596.399 --> 608.55
ace MacLeod that time tank that one guy

603.0 --> 613.76
John Watson the me scan go broken bullet

608.55 --> 617.3389999999999
for one one you'd read em lumberjack

613.76 --> 628.97
lots of conspiracy cat sucks no longer

617.339 --> 638.97
here Jimbo Khan with his obsessive hate

628.97 --> 643.649
against qe0 check oh matrix media Tony

638.97 --> 648.14
baloney Emmerich's j-mac unicorn laser

643.649 --> 648.14
eyes Shan ji

652.68 --> 659.79
some sock presumably right as I thought

658.33 --> 663.61
so

659.79 --> 667.48
redshifts also is gonna look guys anyone

663.61 --> 673.9300000000001
that's obviously a conspiracy cat sock

667.48 --> 680.47
drawer support just Banham for those who

673.93 --> 694.7099999999999
have a wrench please yeah that includes

680.47 --> 700.03
you look I have no problem

694.71 --> 702.1
banning half of you who are actually not

700.03 --> 705.22
falling but just hanging around to try

702.1 --> 708.19
and screw around with me okay so I don't

705.22 --> 711.49
mind just unsubscribe a hundred and

708.19 --> 714.34
subscribers goody I know most there is

711.49 --> 716.86
always a giant pile of fake subscribers

714.34 --> 719.5
specifically to try and [ __ ] with me in

716.86 --> 724.21
certain points because these people just

719.5 --> 728.14
can't help it so if you're here just for

724.21 --> 732.6700000000001
that just unsubscribe go away and get a

728.14 --> 735.85
life okay now if you are interested in

732.67 --> 738.9699999999999
the things that I talked about or if you

735.85 --> 741.22
have questions or some things you would

738.97 --> 744.01
like to go over maybe have a talk with

741.22 --> 749.71
me on skype then by all means subscribe

744.01 --> 751.99
and well behave normally in my chat and

749.71 --> 755.1700000000001
follow the chat rules the live chat

751.99 --> 759.49
rules as described in the description

755.17 --> 766.78
box under live chat rules and everything

759.49 --> 769.45
will be alright oh cool Samhain isn't

766.78 --> 772.81
not having another money spray that's

769.45 --> 780.1600000000001
awesome I hope he comes by my channel as

772.81 --> 783.01
well I think that Samhain is probably a

780.16 --> 785.65
pretty wealthy guy and he's very

783.01 --> 790.36
generous that's what I think he's also

785.65 --> 793.41
been very generous to me so he's one of

790.36 --> 793.41
the precious ones

798.07 --> 801.48
thank you for your assistance

806.69 --> 814.4100000000001
well unicorn laser eyes that's the whole

809.58 --> 816.99
issue if I could take any singular

814.41 --> 823.77
subject and fill an hour with it pretty

816.99 --> 826.65
sure I can but I could find at least 10

823.77 --> 828.72
of the subjects and to do that's for 10

826.65 --> 831.93
straight hours would be very tiresome

828.72 --> 834.21
for me and I don't want to Brenda it and

831.93 --> 836.0999999999999
just spam everything out there because

834.21 --> 840.9000000000001
finally nobody's gonna mute you or

836.1 --> 846.0
something so I did look at this point I

840.9 --> 847.7099999999999
don't really want to be a part of what

846.0 --> 852.66
Brent is doing over there

847.71 --> 855.1800000000001
it's a giant mess it's action painting

852.66 --> 858.65
it's an action painting gallery people

855.18 --> 859.8199999999999
can just come in and just spray whatever

858.65 --> 863.3299999999999
[Music]

859.82 --> 863.33
it's not my thing

886.6 --> 898.339
look Jimbo calm the ether okay the ether

892.759 --> 902.35
is a conceptual medium and there are so

898.339 --> 905.649
many issues with it and that's why they

902.35 --> 907.519
basically just throw it aside because

905.649 --> 910.879
specifically Nitin

907.519 --> 914.93
according to the QE standards rejects

910.879 --> 921.11
anything that's not physically provable

914.93 --> 925.2399999999999
as a door and I don't necessarily abide

921.11 --> 927.889
by that I like to entertain concepts and

925.24 --> 930.8
basically figure out for example why

927.889 --> 935.889
they usually turn out to be aberrations

930.8 --> 939.8599999999999
love to go through that I like the Legos

935.889 --> 943.85
with the technicalities sure I'd like to

939.86 --> 946.97
no problem but people that just claim

943.85 --> 950.3000000000001
the ether is an absolute standard that's

946.97 --> 954.13
not too far off from Globus claiming

950.3 --> 958.3389999999999
gravity is a law of nature

954.13 --> 961.42
it's presuppositional delusion and it

958.339 --> 962.5690000000001
creates a ground for pseudoscience it's

961.42 --> 965.92
useless

962.569 --> 971.959
on the long run it's totally useless and

965.92 --> 975.29
worse it'll distract you from taking

971.959 --> 978.29
notice of actual important new

975.29 --> 982.8499999999999
developing data as you go because the

978.29 --> 985.189
aberration is distracting you you're not

982.85 --> 987.559
seeing the actual things because you

985.189 --> 993.29
believe in the aberration that's how

987.559 --> 995.779
gravity has bypassed so much of our

993.29 --> 999.019
figuring out what what is that how does

995.779 --> 1002.05
it all work and after I finally realized

999.019 --> 1005.74
that shield myself off from the belief

1002.05 --> 1007.66
of gravity then I started to figure out

1005.74 --> 1009.309
relative density and how it really works

1007.66 --> 1013.48
how all the forces come into play

1009.309 --> 1016.3
everything really works well if I had

1013.48 --> 1017.2090000000001
still believed the aberration of gravity

1016.3 --> 1021.4989999999999
I could

1017.209 --> 1024.319
never have even attempted to figure that

1021.499 --> 1027.76
out and that is the issue that is the

1024.319 --> 1030.1689999999999
main issue with accepting something

1027.76 --> 1033.319
because everything you're working with

1030.169 --> 1035.539
is suggesting there must be something

1033.319 --> 1037.73
specific there even though you can't

1035.539 --> 1043.8799999999999
actually grasp it

1037.73 --> 1048.34
that's an aberration and as soon as you

1043.88 --> 1051.98
catch yourself accepting an aberration

1048.34 --> 1054.5
within the framework within a model then

1051.98 --> 1056.929
you have entered a realm of

1054.5 --> 1060.919
pseudoscience it's unfortunate it's

1056.929 --> 1063.679
harsh but it's the truth so that is my

1060.919 --> 1067.22
standpoint on it but I love to talk

1063.679 --> 1069.409
about the conceptualization of the ether

1067.22 --> 1072.59
and there's look there's so many angles

1069.409 --> 1075.169
to the ether so many people use the

1072.59 --> 1079.039
concept or the idea of the ether in

1075.169 --> 1081.6200000000001
various angles including ethereal look

1079.039 --> 1085.34
the ether was even a standard concept in

1081.62 --> 1088.9599999999998
Wicca like the energy so ether as a

1085.34 --> 1094.6299999999999
light stabilizing medium concept and

1088.96 --> 1097.22
based on particle assumption or as some

1094.63 --> 1099.169
energy that connects us all like the

1097.22 --> 1102.919
force and that connects our spirits and

1099.169 --> 1106.94
allows yeah seeming telepathy and all

1102.919 --> 1109.01
that yep there is a lot about the ether

1106.94 --> 1111.0800000000002
and it just should be talked about and

1109.01 --> 1112.94
I'm open for that but anyway sorry for

1111.08 --> 1117.11
late response thank you so much for the

1112.94 --> 1119.8700000000001
super chat Emmerich's j-mac $1 99 keep

1117.11 --> 1122.1689999999999
it flat indeed thank you sorry for the

1119.87 --> 1122.1689999999999
late response

1122.29 --> 1125.44
[Applause]

1137.43 --> 1144.0900000000001
right Jimbo kaan no I

1140.64 --> 1146.49
I haven't actually even gotten to the

1144.09 --> 1147.48
nitty-gritty of the wavefunction

1146.49 --> 1150.99
collapse

1147.48 --> 1154.17
I still haven't approached it I'm now

1150.99 --> 1156.15
working into the depth of what quantum

1154.17 --> 1158.67
mechanics is working with what quantum

1156.15 --> 1161.1000000000001
mechanics ists are actually on the level

1158.67 --> 1161.91
and the refining level they are trying

1161.1 --> 1166.4699999999998
to approach it

1161.91 --> 1170.8500000000001
I'm already stumbling upon the very

1166.47 --> 1173.97
obvious fact that Feynman was absolutely

1170.85 --> 1176.9399999999998
drowning in math and he was addicted to

1173.97 --> 1181.02
it and he accepted presuppositional

1176.94 --> 1184.53
reason without he used it to play with

1181.02 --> 1187.68
and I wonder how much he realized he was

1184.53 --> 1189.75
just playing or if he was actually

1187.68 --> 1191.49
believing that it was real because

1189.75 --> 1193.89
that's what tends to happen in people

1191.49 --> 1195.81
that absolutely drown in conceptual math

1193.89 --> 1197.3400000000001
and that are very good at it they start

1195.81 --> 1203.55
to believe that just because the math

1197.34 --> 1206.6399999999999
works out that it must be real but

1203.55 --> 1209.55
despite that I haven't even come to the

1206.64 --> 1211.8000000000002
concept of the wavefunction collapse and

1209.55 --> 1217.44
I'm starting to wonder now as I dig

1211.8 --> 1219.93
further in is that even real is the

1217.44 --> 1222.81
wavefunction collapse concept even real

1219.93 --> 1226.49
or is it a mathematical framework from

1222.81 --> 1232.31
an altered dimensional perspective I

1226.49 --> 1235.98
wonder I wonder what the actual final

1232.31 --> 1238.59
test the physical setup will be and

1235.98 --> 1240.63
where the claim is laid and how it is

1238.59 --> 1243.1799999999998
addressed it's never really been clear

1240.63 --> 1246.18
everybody has a general description

1243.18 --> 1252.48
thing of what it's supposed to be but

1246.18 --> 1254.16
it's not in a solid state at as explain

1252.48 --> 1256.6200000000001
it's not in a consistent state the

1254.16 --> 1263.28
explanations for it are more story based

1256.62 --> 1266.9399999999998
not physically persistent based so I'm

1263.28 --> 1270.87
I'm ready to go there I'm not expecting

1266.94 --> 1271.44
any person to be able to explain it to

1270.87 --> 1275.05
me

1271.44 --> 1277.059
without falling back to the general

1275.05 --> 1283.809
story that does seem to make some kind

1277.059 --> 1287.02
of sense I've never heard anyone piece

1283.809 --> 1293.59
by piece completely explain what it

1287.02 --> 1298.809
actually is as in how do you demonstrate

1293.59 --> 1306.28
it step by step and then have a genuine

1298.809 --> 1309.67
example of that as it occurs so it may

1306.28 --> 1313.78
be a giant trick hidden under mountains

1309.67 --> 1316.0500000000002
of math it might just sorry about that

1313.78 --> 1319.27
it might just turn out to be just that

1316.05 --> 1322.78
figure it out as I go but I'm not just

1319.27 --> 1325.44
discounting all of it outright because

1322.78 --> 1325.44
of the signs

1346.02 --> 1353.37
right yeah Einstein that attempted to

1350.1 --> 1355.3799999999999
negate the ether concept that's true but

1353.37 --> 1358.11
that's because the ether concept and

1355.38 --> 1361.0500000000002
we're talking about a concept still was

1358.11 --> 1364.05
indirect mathematical opposition to

1361.05 --> 1368.51
where the controllers wanted them there

1364.05 --> 1370.77
the science narrative to go on the

1368.51 --> 1373.35
presuppositional grounds they wanted to

1370.77 --> 1375.9
delve into the ether could not could

1373.35 --> 1380.1299999999999
never be part of that so it was

1375.9 --> 1383.429
politically discarded that doesn't mean

1380.13 --> 1386.91
that it is absolutely real it's just not

1383.429 --> 1390.3000000000002
mathematically compatible that's why

1386.91 --> 1393.38
they chose to discard it you gotta be

1390.3 --> 1393.3799999999999
real about these things

1414.6 --> 1417.559
Oh God

1418.97 --> 1427.13
oh man I'm getting all twitchy I need

1426.53 --> 1430.9089999999999
coffee

1427.13 --> 1435.8200000000002
but twitching a good way also my stomach

1430.909 --> 1440.2990000000002
is doing so much better than a week I

1435.82 --> 1449.03
haven't been sick in anyway today so I'm

1440.299 --> 1452.12
covering it's good maybe it also helps

1449.03 --> 1461.6499999999999
that it hasn't been so terribly hot in a

1452.12 --> 1464.84
while hmm so yeah my search for the or

1461.65 --> 1469.0700000000002
figuring out quantum mechanics will

1464.84 --> 1473.12
continue and I'll figure it out as I go

1469.07 --> 1476.5
how much real tangible things are part

1473.12 --> 1480.26
of it and how much is pure

1476.5 --> 1483.26
presuppositional speculation yeah hidden

1480.26 --> 1487.34
under huge piles of math to discourage

1483.26 --> 1491.48
or to disable regular people from

1487.34 --> 1495.53
finding the answers so it could be just

1491.48 --> 1497.6200000000001
a giant math Playhouse trap to trap

1495.53 --> 1499.97
people that are super smart into

1497.62 --> 1502.9089999999999
preoccupying themselves with this math

1499.97 --> 1505.309
and then eventually at the end of it

1502.909 --> 1507.679
they might discover that it is all

1505.309 --> 1509.1789999999999
[ __ ] and then they'll figure out

1507.679 --> 1510.74
that they wasted half their life

1509.179 --> 1514.88
believing things that turn out to be

1510.74 --> 1519.86
false and they'll snap they'll snap hard

1514.88 --> 1524.69
and it was terrifying to even realize

1519.86 --> 1531.3999999999999
that as I saw within the Big Bang Theory

1524.69 --> 1534.8300000000002
how they said yeah this what is the this

1531.4 --> 1537.65
theoretical physics snapped yeah that

1534.83 --> 1540.4089999999999
happens more often at a certain point in

1537.65 --> 1544.159
their career they'd suddenly just snap

1540.409 --> 1546.409
it just happens why would it happen well

1544.159 --> 1551.68
maybe because they figure it out it's

1546.409 --> 1554.68
all fake yeah you dead well snap

1551.68 --> 1556.93
in this case that Professor that snap he

1554.68 --> 1559.39
literally took off all his clothes and

1556.93 --> 1565.14
was just walking around naked and he was

1559.39 --> 1568.66
like yeah I'm naked that's normal

1565.14 --> 1571.9
it was amazing to put those pieces

1568.66 --> 1574.48
together to figure out how because the

1571.9 --> 1577.69
Feynman lectures and his works are

1574.48 --> 1579.58
regularly referenced at least in the

1577.69 --> 1584.8600000000001
fourth season that I've noticed this is

1579.58 --> 1588.1
like pretty shocking too to see Sheldon

1584.86 --> 1591.1599999999999
like oh oh yeah so just all everybody

1588.1 --> 1593.1599999999999
knows about him oh it's so new oh you're

1591.16 --> 1596.2
so stupid if you don't even get that

1593.16 --> 1600.22
that's so dope yeah I totally get it

1596.2 --> 1603.31
because shittin Sheldon is a full zealot

1600.22 --> 1606.31
math religiously mathematical so he

1603.31 --> 1608.44
would love that stuff it would be like a

1606.31 --> 1613.99
giant playing ground of math to him

1608.44 --> 1617.74
Feynman so it makes total sense it's

1613.99 --> 1620.52
just wonderful that I'm really starting

1617.74 --> 1625.69
to figure out what it all is really

1620.52 --> 1631.47
feeling it seeing how the pieces now fit

1625.69 --> 1631.47
together what they mean it's interesting

1640.26 --> 1647.95
Dave Johnson I'm definitely going that

1644.5 --> 1650.95
far because it is all relevant I'm

1647.95 --> 1653.23
pretty certain that the crew who wrote

1650.95 --> 1657.82
the script for these people

1653.23 --> 1661.15
in the Big Bang Theory are literally

1657.82 --> 1664.059
tapping into what is generally talked

1661.15 --> 1667.0
about and is popular and is typical in

1664.059 --> 1670.21
that in that order of people because

1667.0 --> 1672.52
there are a lot of nerds and then they

1670.21 --> 1675.19
kind of over stereotype it but they do

1672.52 --> 1679.6299999999999
bring in subjects that would touch upon

1675.19 --> 1682.299
a range of people that many involving

1679.63 --> 1685.0200000000002
themselves with these people will have

1682.299 --> 1687.7
heard about through these people and

1685.02 --> 1693.58
that's their tactic so they bring in

1687.7 --> 1696.22
bits of data well if you know more about

1693.58 --> 1698.1399999999999
it much more you probably be very

1696.22 --> 1700.1490000000001
offended about a lot of it because you

1698.14 --> 1703.179
do know it's just screwing around with

1700.149 --> 1704.9799999999998
people's minds really really get it and

1703.179 --> 1708.73
you're not used to the world being like

1704.98 --> 1710.289
this and then yeah people that really

1708.73 --> 1712.57
are super smart

1710.289 --> 1715.45
probably just totally hate this series

1712.57 --> 1718.57
and it's been said that a lot of nerds

1715.45 --> 1720.82
really hate the Big Bang Theory and they

1718.57 --> 1724.4189999999999
call it like it's yeah that's for old

1720.82 --> 1727.09
women that just want to gloat over a

1724.419 --> 1730.96
phantom grandson that is really smart I

1727.09 --> 1735.58
totally get that but it's not completely

1730.96 --> 1738.58
dumb there is just interesting details

1735.58 --> 1742.48
in there and does give kind of

1738.58 --> 1746.97
interesting portrayal of what's what

1742.48 --> 1746.97
could be what might be dynamics

1748.61 --> 1755.51
I find it especially fascinating that

1753.409 --> 1759.3500000000001
the one guy that's supposedly like the

1755.51 --> 1761.87
the underdog as in he's not a professor

1759.35 --> 1764.1789999999999
so and yeah Sheldon lost her mind

1761.87 --> 1766.549
he's the NASA guy he's always trying to

1764.179 --> 1771.2
get in with NASA do something go to

1766.549 --> 1774.76
space build them and then trying to pick

1771.2 --> 1780.95
up ladies with that and I find that so

1774.76 --> 1787.24
amazingly typical it portrays in a wider

1780.95 --> 1787.24
thing the entirety of it

1791.37 --> 1800.289
so maybe I just see a little bit too

1794.23 --> 1801.64
much in the series but I do find it

1800.289 --> 1804.7
fascinating because I've watched it

1801.64 --> 1807.46
before years and years ago multiple

1804.7 --> 1809.5800000000002
times watching with my ex and years

1807.46 --> 1813.8500000000001
before that on my own

1809.58 --> 1816.82
friends from then and back then I just

1813.85 --> 1818.4399999999998
didn't get it I was just like ah nerds

1816.82 --> 1821.799
oh yeah it sounds typically like nerds

1818.44 --> 1825.8200000000002
get it second time I got a little bit

1821.799 --> 1827.62
more my ex and now I'm really starting

1825.82 --> 1829.98
to understand these materials again they

1827.62 --> 1833.85
don't frighten me anymore

1829.98 --> 1833.85
but it's a good experience

1844.21 --> 1853.47
it's no ragnar Stefan Alison that's that

1849.73 --> 1853.47
would be this afonya thing to do

1856.679 --> 1864.249
look I could literally feel my channel

1860.47 --> 1867.369
probably with several hours a day just

1864.249 --> 1873.19
making freakin Stefania response videos

1867.369 --> 1876.84
to idiots out there but yeah I'd be as a

1873.19 --> 1879.669
fine yeah to do that I don't wanna

1876.84 --> 1881.259
it's disgusting I think it's disgusting

1879.669 --> 1884.23
when other people do it

1881.259 --> 1888.49
although there are exceptions for

1884.23 --> 1891.179
example Reilly does it all the time but

1888.49 --> 1895.299
he does it with so much attention and

1891.179 --> 1898.3300000000002
he's not just a there's still you know

1895.299 --> 1900.99
he's trying to almost like like a court

1898.33 --> 1905.309
case out of it and I find that amusing

1900.99 --> 1911.619
he's creative so it's not yeah

1905.309 --> 1913.21
but he's one of the few people that does

1911.619 --> 1916.119
that kind of thing that I can actually

1913.21 --> 1919.049
watch those videos and still find it

1916.119 --> 1919.049
interesting and amusing

1924.82 --> 1932.52
but look who knows for example you could

1929.47 --> 1935.23
imagine that at some point that

1932.52 --> 1937.48
everything keeps on going as it goes you

1935.23 --> 1939.45
know I get further in my quantum

1937.48 --> 1942.34
mechanic studies and I get a solid

1939.45 --> 1946.8
perspective where I figure out this is

1942.34 --> 1950.1999999999998
fake this is the entire monolithic all

1946.8 --> 1952.45
framework to prove that well and then

1950.2 --> 1955.45
quantum eraser may literally go

1952.45 --> 1958.75
this is unacceptable River River you've

1955.45 --> 1964.21
gone off the blah blah blah he could do

1958.75 --> 1966.4
that well then I may be forced for my

1964.21 --> 1969.75
own studies for the value of what I do

1966.4 --> 1972.73
to literally make a video like that and

1969.75 --> 1974.71
say look I ask the question here's the

1972.73 --> 1977.47
question because I've asked it this is

1974.71 --> 1980.5
how we responded this is how that is a

1977.47 --> 1983.08
red herring or a blah blah blah or God

1980.5 --> 1985.6
all these reasoning structures maybe

1983.08 --> 1988.6899999999998
that's one of the times that I might be

1985.6 --> 1990.85
inclined to actually do it but other

1988.69 --> 1995.74
than that to just these ballers out

1990.85 --> 1999.87
there and the ridiculous nonsense it's

1995.74 --> 1999.8700000000001
literal waste of time sorry

2003.24 --> 2006.299
[Music]

2014.71 --> 2023.529
okay well I think you're probably a

2019.64 --> 2027.2
Suhani since everything you said so far

2023.529 --> 2034.159
every single thing you said in here was

2027.2 --> 2039.38
whining and completely and I think

2034.159 --> 2042.1100000000001
you're it only reason why people would

2039.38 --> 2044.47
complain about Suhani or the legitimacy

2042.11 --> 2046.4289999999999
blablabla is because they are so Vanya

2044.47 --> 2052.03
you don't like it

2046.429 --> 2052.03
people actually name what you've become

2068.71 --> 2072.76
oh well Dave jumps and let me answer

2071.47 --> 2075.1789999999996
that question for you

2072.76 --> 2077.98
even though you asked somebody else

2075.179 --> 2080.079
that's Pete Pete doesn't really answer

2077.98 --> 2085.359
questions anyway just red herrings with

2080.079 --> 2089.53
more of his standard PJ doctrine but

2085.359 --> 2093.7
yeah you don't see the Sun or moon

2089.53 --> 2096.4900000000002
getting bigger overhead because there is

2093.7 --> 2099.069
no proximity for the Sun or moon to

2096.49 --> 2101.2599999999998
become bigger to you at some point

2099.069 --> 2103.89
because it's not in any physical

2101.26 --> 2108.4300000000003
location

2103.89 --> 2110.17
it's an angular location in relation to

2108.43 --> 2112.0
the observer that is where you see the

2110.17 --> 2117.19
Sun in the moon and that angular

2112.0 --> 2120.069
location the the speed of it and the

2117.19 --> 2122.8
apparent size is pretty persistent the

2120.069 --> 2127.0589999999997
only change really occurs when you are

2122.8 --> 2131.309
looking towards those those apparent

2127.059 --> 2134.349
light bodies apparent through an

2131.309 --> 2136.059
obviously thicker layer of the

2134.349 --> 2138.19
atmosphere very close down to the ground

2136.059 --> 2142.809
and then there may be some refractive

2138.19 --> 2147.579
based changes to it color changes size

2142.809 --> 2149.52
changes maybe but besides that layer

2147.579 --> 2154.42
very close to the ground

2149.52 --> 2157.21
there is almost no optical alteration so

2154.42 --> 2161.589
it will simply be visible at the certain

2157.21 --> 2164.14
angle the angular relation that the

2161.589 --> 2169.299
heavenly body has in relation to the

2164.14 --> 2171.93
observer and their positions they're not

2169.299 --> 2171.93
objects

2175.93 --> 2178.89
that's right

2181.13 --> 2187.1600000000003
but they're not close they're not far

2183.83 --> 2192.44
away they are not in a location because

2187.16 --> 2194.8999999999996
they are not objects they are light that

2192.44 --> 2198.65
is all we see that is all we can prove

2194.9 --> 2199.76
about them they have no signs of a

2198.65 --> 2203.33
physical location

2199.76 --> 2206.2700000000004
there's no approachability factor they

2203.33 --> 2213.47
are elusive like Holograms like

2206.27 --> 2216.14
Holograms I'm saying Dave Johnson not

2213.47 --> 2218.93
projections because again that is a

2216.14 --> 2223.22
physical process that's technology that

2218.93 --> 2225.1699999999996
is something the clear manifestation of

2223.22 --> 2227.4199999999996
something that is holographic what I'm

2225.17 --> 2233.33
saying is it is holographic in nature it

2227.42 --> 2236.87
is somehow manifesting as light in that

2233.33 --> 2239.21
specific setup purely relational to

2236.87 --> 2242.8399999999997
observers and their location on the

2239.21 --> 2245.14
earth that's it that is the data that is

2242.84 --> 2245.1400000000003
there

2254.07 --> 2260.04
yeah yeah this very nice you're in those

2257.1 --> 2262.2
myths keep on pumping out your freaking

2260.04 --> 2266.04
trickery myths about your really waist

2262.2 --> 2268.95
bunching of the moon blah blah blah I've

2266.04 --> 2271.65
never seen anyone do it thousands of

2268.95 --> 2278.45
claims thousands and thousands nobody

2271.65 --> 2281.4300000000003
ever did it just people with equipment

2278.45 --> 2284.27
connections and money whining that they

2281.43 --> 2287.54
can do it and that is ridiculous

2284.27 --> 2287.54
that's it

2303.04 --> 2305.73
now

2316.36 --> 2325.96
what is visible light visible light is

2320.74 --> 2333.22
light arriving in your eye and however

2325.96 --> 2335.05
that lights manifested I don't know in

2333.22 --> 2337.72
the case of the heavenly bodies I don't

2335.05 --> 2340.1800000000003
know how they manifest without having an

2337.72 --> 2349.74
original specific position from which

2340.18 --> 2353.0499999999997
they radiate just seems to be the case

2349.74 --> 2355.93
until we can find the literal origin

2353.05 --> 2358.78
point of that light and trace it back to

2355.93 --> 2360.8199999999997
a specific position from which it can be

2358.78 --> 2365.71
varied and manipulate to prove that that

2360.82 --> 2367.78
is the origin of it there is no source

2365.71 --> 2371.83
that you can prove and it could

2367.78 --> 2374.3500000000004
literally through some weird miraculous

2371.83 --> 2377.62
seemingly miraculous process manifest

2374.35 --> 2381.37
just manifest come into being through

2377.62 --> 2384.94
the energies however that works without

2381.37 --> 2389.71
having a tangible specific positioned

2384.94 --> 2393.52
source maybe the entire realm itself is

2389.71 --> 2397.27
literally the source and the way we see

2393.52 --> 2401.31
it is just how that source manifests

2397.27 --> 2401.31
that energy in that fashion

2415.44 --> 2423.779
well I'm not convinced that you are

2419.24 --> 2426.2889999999998
doing not so this claim of freakin radio

2423.779 --> 2429.69
bounds blah blah blah as I said

2426.289 --> 2432.2690000000002
thousands of people claim this none of

2429.69 --> 2435.39
actually shown something that would

2432.269 --> 2442.109
that'll shut us up nobody it's just the

2435.39 --> 2444.8089999999997
frickin claims all the time so yeah just

2442.109 --> 2448.109
say it one more time and I'll ban you

2444.809 --> 2461.2400000000002
okay just do it just do it say it one

2448.109 --> 2461.24
more time or you could drop it

2464.75 --> 2471.45
yeah yeah cool channel name except that

2469.589 --> 2475.0499999999997
you don't have any confirmation of that

2471.45 --> 2477.5099999999998
you have no proof of any proximity of

2475.05 --> 2481.26
any energy transmissions emissions to

2477.51 --> 2483.69
the localized position of the Sun only

2481.26 --> 2488.63
thing is got you got is things being

2483.69 --> 2488.63
absorbed here let you all you got

2489.92 --> 2499.41
there's no proof of a field emanating

2492.96 --> 2501.329
from a Sun position although I'm sure

2499.41 --> 2508.3799999999997
you got a lot of presuppositional math

2501.329 --> 2512.579
[ __ ] to back your nonsense right

2508.38 --> 2515.6600000000003
well you don't observe fields cool

2512.579 --> 2518.01
channel name you don't observe them you

2515.66 --> 2521.64
can observe light hitting your eye

2518.01 --> 2526.619
though that's what you can observe yeah

2521.64 --> 2529.7599999999998
there is light that's right that's it

2526.619 --> 2529.76
it's all you got

2534.619 --> 2543.2490000000003
oh yeah sure you sends a lot of things I

2539.65 --> 2543.2490000000003
sense a lot of things

2550.77 --> 2558.69
mm-hmm oh really so that's really nice

2556.41 --> 2561.0899999999997
and and how far does that static

2558.69 --> 2563.43
electricity reach do you feel the static

2561.09 --> 2567.33
static electricity field from the Sun

2563.43 --> 2570.08
cool channel name do you feel that do

2567.33 --> 2570.08
you feel it

2572.13 --> 2575.309
[Music]

2577.15 --> 2585.029
oh you can Kenya well you could do

2581.799 --> 2590.849
something about that I'd report to a

2585.029 --> 2590.849
psychology and treat that fantasy

2596.72 --> 2600.64
[Music]

2605.66 --> 2608.7599999999998
[Music]

2610.91 --> 2619.47
yeah got a lot of trolls in my chat

2614.73 --> 2623.0
these days so conspiracy gets rubbing

2619.47 --> 2625.74
his shitty shitty sock drawers on me

2623.0 --> 2628.97
that brings so many of his trolls that

2625.74 --> 2633.0
just lift a troll wherever he threats

2628.97 --> 2635.43
like just like bunch of demons falling

2633.0 --> 2639.12
in the steps of some demon lord walking

2635.43 --> 2641.16
around just like in the game Diablo they

2639.12 --> 2648.8599999999997
really are just a bunch of demons all of

2641.16 --> 2648.8599999999997
them right

2654.31 --> 2661.18
thank you Dave Johnson I have to I

2658.71 --> 2668.34
wouldn't have a life if I whatever I

2661.18 --> 2672.6099999999997
didn't so the the best I can do is just

2668.34 --> 2674.65
bash ballers for terrible behavior to

2672.61 --> 2678.2200000000003
get the terrible behavior out of the way

2674.65 --> 2685.23
because their ball ernest is not going

2678.22 --> 2685.23
away not by any actions that i can do it

2685.35 --> 2691.21
it's just gonna take a lot of time and

2688.12 --> 2694.9
for them to make that decision at some

2691.21 --> 2698.05
point but just being pissed off at

2694.9 --> 2700.09
everyone it's not gonna help them it's

2698.05 --> 2702.69
not gonna help me getting pissed off a

2700.09 --> 2706.1200000000003
lot it's actually not healthy for me i

2702.69 --> 2708.67
feel much healthier much better when i

2706.12 --> 2712.5
don't get angry a lot and i haven't been

2708.67 --> 2712.5
angry in a while I like it

2713.25 --> 2719.95
although yeah I'm the debates spur Skibo

2717.07 --> 2723.1800000000003
and everything does yeah I can get

2719.95 --> 2723.18
really agitated now

2738.0 --> 2740.599
right

2741.98 --> 2751.91
well Alexander venturina ether can be

2748.13 --> 2756.17
many things again but what ether is from

2751.91 --> 2759.859
the physics angle originally from optics

2756.17 --> 2762.92
is a theoretical conceptual medium that

2759.859 --> 2764.48
has to be there just like gravity would

2762.92 --> 2767.7200000000003
have to be you had to explain these

2764.48 --> 2772.339
structures would have to be there in

2767.72 --> 2779.39
order for light to be able to slow down

2772.339 --> 2781.609
and then return to its speed because

2779.39 --> 2786.2
they can't explain it any other way why

2781.609 --> 2788.7799999999997
that happens but yeah if you think about

2786.2 --> 2791.18
it much much more carefully so for

2788.78 --> 2795.77
example even approached everything now

2791.18 --> 2797.7799999999997
just the whole molecular particle

2795.77 --> 2800.27
presuppositional systems and all that

2797.78 --> 2804.079
well it has something to do with this as

2800.27 --> 2806.63
well so if there isn't some kind of

2804.079 --> 2809.3590000000004
weird medium required in order for light

2806.63 --> 2812.78
to slow down to a certain speed and all

2809.359 --> 2819.92
that then maybe it's just completely

2812.78 --> 2823.6600000000003
misunderstood I think that's a much more

2819.92 --> 2823.66
logical conclusion to draw

2829.35 --> 2832.46
[Music]

2833.82 --> 2836.51
yeah

2858.68 --> 2863.779
stop wasting my time PJ

2868.35 --> 2872.33
don't you actually go do something

2874.91 --> 2878.02
[Music]

2879.579 --> 2882.299
cut

2887.63 --> 2897.63
yeah Brenda wants it to get on the panel

2890.43 --> 2899.8799999999997
again of course of course now she

2897.63 --> 2903.11
actually asked for a little bit earlier

2899.88 --> 2905.58
on I didn't see it can't say really

2903.11 --> 2907.6400000000003
looking forward to doing anything like

2905.58 --> 2907.64
that

2919.07 --> 2930.6200000000003
Oh Alexander venti rune venturina ether

2926.69 --> 2934.73
as it is accepted within physics is

2930.62 --> 2937.04
indeed conceptual it is what would have

2934.73 --> 2940.31
to be there in order for the things to

2937.04 --> 2942.32
work as they do by the standard of the

2940.31 --> 2945.58
framework that they are using to

2942.32 --> 2945.5800000000004
approach everything

2951.64 --> 2959.2599999999998
but technically yet you can't prove it

2956.38 --> 2963.07
even is there if you can manipulate it

2959.26 --> 2966.78
if it's just a setting it's much more

2963.07 --> 2966.78
likely it's simply misunderstood

2989.45 --> 2992.89
organ Kappa

3010.69 --> 3021.2400000000002
Wow I get can you feel the weight of

3015.97 --> 3024.24
that pj warned us my god the pressure

3021.24 --> 3024.24
sheesh

3047.68 --> 3052.56
huh okay so check out that's interesting

3060.83 --> 3068.33
audio exclusive hmm

3064.9 --> 3073.57
does that work for Windows 7 though it

3068.33 --> 3073.5699999999997
might be a Windows 10 thing I don't know

3078.829 --> 3084.369
mark oh good gotta go be back in two

3082.249 --> 3084.3689999999997
minutes

3177.839 --> 3180.839
yo

3186.609 --> 3189.359
right

3205.05 --> 3208.9700000000003
that depends lone hyena

3214.78 --> 3219.96
I'm still waiting for an apology for

3218.38 --> 3225.87
your weird

3219.96 --> 3225.87
what okay

3227.07 --> 3231.6600000000003
I'm gonna remove that

3236.579 --> 3239.569
what is it

3258.36 --> 3261.65
okay it's a video

3264.78 --> 3273.6000000000004
hmm so he did that one guy yeah it's a

3268.23 --> 3278.75
long time ago okay okay

3273.6 --> 3278.75
Lana inna let's see

3306.39 --> 3308.45
you

3402.08 --> 3408.25
what I hate this mute button

3410.12 --> 3414.14
I don't know what the hell's wrong with

3411.83 --> 3417.64
this thing but half of the time when I

3414.14 --> 3417.64
push it it just doesn't work

3429.37 --> 3435.9
all right now the problem is I'm just

3433.45 --> 3438.25
assuming it's gonna work every time I

3435.9 --> 3441.88
push the button when I hear the sound

3438.25 --> 3444.88
but it just doesn't it's actually kind

3441.88 --> 3447.34
of annoying so every time I do that I

3444.88 --> 3450.34
have to look if it actually stops

3447.34 --> 3453.1000000000004
flickering now because the click system

3450.34 --> 3456.09
is just not as reliable as I expected it

3453.1 --> 3460.5299999999997
would be as it seemed to be at first

3456.09 --> 3460.53
just a shitty quality button

3465.08 --> 3468.17
[Music]

3472.54 --> 3479.23
the rest of the microphone is fine by

3474.91 --> 3481.27
the way but just a mute button anyway

3479.23 --> 3483.369
it's just a freaking button not really

3481.27 --> 3487.03
that important but I don't know I like

3483.369 --> 3488.4700000000003
using it a lot because it's easy yeah

3487.03 --> 3489.2200000000003
but it's not so easy if it doesn't

3488.47 --> 3496.48
really work

3489.22 --> 3499.0
half of the time anyway I'm gonna round

3496.48 --> 3504.609
out the show I'm not gonna get to any

3499.0 --> 3511.3
new subjects anyway just remember to go

3504.609 --> 3517.71
and watch the premiere of Jon's official

3511.3 --> 3520.6600000000003
opening tonight 8 o'clock London time

3517.71 --> 3525.01
yeah check it I'll be there I hope it's

3520.66 --> 3528.54
gonna be interesting cool and I'm also

3525.01 --> 3532.9300000000003
gonna join the debates right after this

3528.54 --> 3534.67
so I hope you like to show if you have

3532.93 --> 3536.5299999999997
then please don't forget to upload it

3534.67 --> 3538.869
and if you haven't subscribed to my

3536.53 --> 3540.3100000000004

3538.869 --> 3542.1400000000003
bell notification so you know when I'm

3540.31 --> 3545.02
gonna live which is normally 2 p.m. and

3542.14 --> 3548.5299999999997
Amsterdam time every day hashtag me if I

3545.02 --> 3550.72
indeed please support my channel too

3548.53 --> 3553.51
through the super chat Society I've got

3550.72 --> 3555.43
some support today thank you again don't

3553.51 --> 3558.07
forget about PayPal as long as it's

3555.43 --> 3561.18
still there Vale about to me as long as

3558.07 --> 3563.92
I haven't become some political target

3561.18 --> 3566.74
I'd expected that to happen sooner but

3563.92 --> 3570.07
I'm glad I'm not really don't mind

3566.74 --> 3573.49
besides who cares about some guy on the

3570.07 --> 3576.4
internet with only with not even one and

3573.49 --> 3578.83
a half thousand subscribers so maybe

3576.4 --> 3581.859
that's the reason why anyway thanks for

3578.83 --> 3583.18
all the support so far and I will be

3581.859 --> 3586.2999999999997
back tomorrow with flattered the

3583.18 --> 3588.0699999999997
earlybird number 269 and of course I'm

3586.3 --> 3590.8
gonna join the Flat Earth debates right

3588.07 --> 3594.9
after this on Nathan Oakley until the

3590.8 --> 3594.9
next video keep it flat

3595.76 --> 3625.82
