so

80.72 --> 87.84
the weather today is just like this is

84.159 --> 87.84
turn around look at this

89.36 --> 91.67999999999999
it's a

92.96 --> 98.32
beautiful clear skied mostly anyway

97.119 --> 99.28
sunny day

98.32 --> 101.03999999999999
and it's

99.28 --> 104.24
like really warm

101.04 --> 104.24000000000001
warmer than yesterday

106.159 --> 111.28
it's odd i didn't expect that

108.799 --> 114.60000000000001
like three hours ago because i did get

111.28 --> 114.6
up pretty early

115.119 --> 120.0
and there were a lot of trails up there

116.96 --> 123.28
but they seem to have

120.0 --> 126.32
not blurred things up too much

123.28 --> 130.64000000000001
there is like those

126.32 --> 133.12
foggy type of high clouds here and there

130.64 --> 138.319
it's odd

133.12 --> 138.31900000000002
but yeah it's beautiful skies bright sun

138.959 --> 142.64000000000001
and

139.92 --> 144.64
yeah a bit a bit wind of wind every now

142.64 --> 148.0
and then but

144.64 --> 150.319
it's not like cold or anything

148.0 --> 152.48
at least not for now

150.319 --> 153.92
i bet if the sun goes behind the clouds

152.48 --> 157.56
again it will

153.92 --> 157.55999999999997
cool off quickly

157.76 --> 162.44
with the sun out there it's really nice

170.319 --> 176.72
ah look at the bright it's bright

173.68 --> 179.68
hello pj crew shank first in chat

176.72 --> 179.68
matthew mitchell

182.4 --> 185.84
a nice dare of the day over there

186.56 --> 192.08
little nippy but the sun's out yeah yeah

190.239 --> 195.76
i'll check the temperature

192.08 --> 199.31900000000002
but anyway it is tuesday the 28th of

195.76 --> 199.319
september 2021

200.18 --> 203.28900000000002
[Music]

209.04 --> 214.239
all right huh

210.64 --> 216.159
what it's 18 degrees celsius

214.239 --> 218.959
it's really odd because it doesn't feel

216.159 --> 218.959
like that at all

219.12 --> 225.0
i guess it is the temperature that would

221.12 --> 225.0
be measured in the shadow

228.879 --> 231.12
huh

236.72 --> 239.72
right

240.159 --> 246.0
so yeah yesterday show

242.959 --> 249.92000000000002
was awesome it was an extra long show

246.0 --> 249.92
because there was no live letter debates

250.4 --> 255.84
and i might have been able to even carry

252.959 --> 255.84
on longer but

258.239 --> 262.63899999999995
at some point it was just enough

261.04 --> 266.6
but i watched the whole thing back and

262.639 --> 266.6
it was just really good

269.04 --> 272.40000000000003
uh

271.04 --> 274.40000000000003
right also

272.4 --> 275.28
plenty of live streams again yesterday

274.4 --> 278.56
uh

275.28 --> 278.55999999999995
i met you from australia

278.8 --> 283.1
made by jim bob like they're basically

281.04 --> 285.91900000000004
my two new favorite channels oh

283.1 --> 289.6
[Music]

285.919 --> 289.59999999999997
that's why they're in my favorite list

292.639 --> 296.68
and

293.68 --> 296.68
brandon's

297.04 --> 301.12
let's just yeah

298.96 --> 303.039
i kind of like to listen to that in the

301.12 --> 307.36
background mostly

303.039 --> 310.96
just flat earthers and globers and

307.36 --> 312.639
everything just going at it

310.96 --> 315.44
and then i play a game

312.639 --> 315.44
at the same time

315.68 --> 321.68
it's interesting back chatter

318.8 --> 324.68
sometimes i comment

321.68 --> 324.68
anyway

325.52 --> 330.0
yeah like this weather certainly did

327.919 --> 333.35999999999996
change around the feel of things it's

330.0 --> 336.56
it's kind of ironic yesterday it was a

333.36 --> 338.32
like oh it feels so different it feels

336.56 --> 340.56
like the summer's gone and now it's like

338.32 --> 341.759
oh oh wait wait there's a bit of summer

340.56 --> 345.039
here back

341.759 --> 345.039
just just for now

345.12 --> 349.72
i really get like boosted up

363.84 --> 368.56
also watch back on benjamin

366.479 --> 370.479
i got to half of it that's what i was

368.56 --> 372.88
watching pretty much before i started

370.479 --> 372.88
the show

373.759 --> 376.47900000000004
that's good

376.72 --> 380.52000000000004
and it was good

386.72 --> 393.639
so yeah guys i'm here

390.08 --> 393.639
open for inquiry

396.72 --> 400.47900000000004
16 degrees celsius there

403.6 --> 409.24
oh you like you like the cool air more

405.68 --> 409.24
pj crew shank

413.759 --> 416.759
hey

423.52 --> 430.52
yeah by the way i did not get any paypal

426.0 --> 430.52
donation at all yesterday

437.199 --> 441.12
but yeah

438.639 --> 441.12
whatever

443.44 --> 448.24
i'll just eat less huh

446.639 --> 450.72
kind of works together

448.24 --> 454.36
why not

450.72 --> 454.36
just eat less

479.199 --> 482.479
anyway i've run out of

482.639 --> 487.84000000000003
like flat earth mechanics puns for now i

485.599 --> 489.28
had kind of a streak in the last half

487.84 --> 493.71999999999997
week

489.28 --> 493.71999999999997
but yeah i'm kind of done with that

494.479 --> 497.919
it'll be back no doubt

498.16 --> 501.52000000000004
maybe

499.44 --> 504.479
just there not being any flat earth

501.52 --> 506.4
debate life at all like it kind of like

504.479 --> 508.8
cut it off

506.4 --> 510.87899999999996
feel a bit like a goat

508.8 --> 513.52
you know when you stop milking them they

510.879 --> 513.52
just stop

518.24 --> 524.24
and add that it i guess it is kind of

520.64 --> 527.1999999999999
like 10th man that does that

524.24 --> 529.279
he constantly is milking puns

527.2 --> 531.6
and then you just start to produce pun

529.279 --> 531.6
milk

532.16 --> 536.959
this feels weird

534.8 --> 539.3599999999999
i think it's a good metaphor

536.959 --> 539.3599999999999
anyway

543.44 --> 546.48
oh

544.8 --> 549.8389999999999
all right peter cr dude don't worry

546.48 --> 549.839
about it man

558.64 --> 563.68
is nathan on holiday no

561.36 --> 566.24
he was just very busy with something

563.68 --> 566.2399999999999
else i think

572.08 --> 577.839
or maybe he wasn't holiday i don't know

574.24 --> 577.839
he didn't really tell

586.32 --> 589.279
let me scroll back

604.48 --> 607.04
what was it

611.279 --> 615.12
i can't find it but whatever

614.24 --> 618.72
uh

615.12 --> 621.04
we'll find out soon enough

618.72 --> 625.0790000000001
in about

621.04 --> 625.079
an hour and 15 minutes

637.36 --> 641.6800000000001
weird man

638.8 --> 644.16
it's like i feel weird like micro muscle

641.68 --> 647.76
spasms a bit but it's because i drank

644.16 --> 651.76
another coffee yesterday evening

647.76 --> 655.04
but not ate properly right so that

651.76 --> 657.04
yeah that makes me feel it

655.04 --> 660.399
i always have to keep reminding myself

657.04 --> 662.959
about these things through

660.399 --> 662.959
doing it

669.12 --> 674.44
oh okay matthew mitchell i appreciate

671.44 --> 674.44
that

676.32 --> 680.9590000000001
you could also consider becoming a

678.32 --> 680.9590000000001
patreon

681.68 --> 686.2399999999999
because my list is really short

684.32 --> 687.7600000000001
but yeah those that have been on there

686.24 --> 691.12
they have been on there for a while and

687.76 --> 691.12
i really appreciate them

692.32 --> 697.6800000000001
but yeah paypal always works the most

694.88 --> 697.68
directly so

699.12 --> 704.48
thanks thanks for the

701.68 --> 704.4799999999999
for the vouch

705.2 --> 710.5600000000001
but yes pay for what you enjoy if you

707.44 --> 710.5600000000001
enjoy what i do

710.639 --> 714.8
and i sometimes have a little bit of

712.48 --> 717.839
doubt about that but that's because yeah

714.8 --> 717.8389999999999
it's me

718.639 --> 723.839
but i get plenty of feedback to reinsure

721.519 --> 725.839
like yeah yeah it's good it's good don't

723.839 --> 728.399
have to worry like it's not like you're

725.839 --> 730.5600000000001
not getting paid because you're failing

728.399 --> 732.16
and everybody's too embarrassed to say

730.56 --> 733.1199999999999
anything about it

732.16 --> 735.12
right

733.12 --> 738.0
that that's the kind of tricks that my

735.12 --> 741.04
mind sometimes plays on me

738.0 --> 744.079
under that sort of tension

741.04 --> 747.92
but uh

744.079 --> 747.92
i really appreciate the vouch

755.68 --> 759.519
but it's also

757.12 --> 761.04
in a way i don't i don't completely

759.519 --> 763.839
understand the whole trend of the

761.04 --> 763.8389999999999
situation

765.68 --> 767.519
right

766.48 --> 769.6
because

767.519 --> 771.839
like over the years there have been some

769.6 --> 775.2
big players as i call them that really

771.839 --> 778.24
like to lay down big super chats

775.2 --> 780.9590000000001
with some now i specifically asked to do

778.24 --> 782.9590000000001
to get paypal because super chat not

780.959 --> 786.88
really arriving if you

782.959 --> 791.04
yeah do it in google in the chat

786.88 --> 791.04
but that's why it's last on the list

791.839 --> 795.7600000000001
and the membership system right it's

793.92 --> 798.0
still good for the stats but it doesn't

795.76 --> 801.12
really help me financially and there's

798.0 --> 802.56
been big players that would just well

801.12 --> 805.36
donate

802.56 --> 808.16
big big amounts but it

805.36 --> 810.24
i still see them out there

808.16 --> 811.68
well not them it's like other players

810.24 --> 815.12
come along

811.68 --> 816.16
and i see them donating

815.12 --> 818.639
but

816.16 --> 821.76
yeah for some reason i

818.639 --> 821.76
i'm not on their list

823.92 --> 828.4799999999999
and i feel a little left out but that's

826.0 --> 830.32
like yeah let's screw that

828.48 --> 832.24
you know

830.32 --> 834.88
it's voluntary you can't just like oh

832.24 --> 838.399
but he got some i want some too this is

834.88 --> 838.399
not flat earth socialism

839.6 --> 843.1990000000001
so

840.639 --> 845.279
but i am a little puzzled about like how

843.199 --> 846.959
the trend has changed

845.279 --> 848.399
i don't really know what not what to do

846.959 --> 850.3199999999999
about it

848.399 --> 853.279
like i was in a pretty good position in

850.32 --> 855.6
the last year like that it worked it was

853.279 --> 859.12
working

855.6 --> 860.88
pretty much the entire year and hey

859.12 --> 864.5600000000001
i think i might have accidentally

860.88 --> 864.56
started taking it for granted

869.04 --> 871.92
i realize

870.959 --> 874.56
it is

871.92 --> 877.36
another ironic reflection on yesterday's

874.56 --> 877.3599999999999
show's title

882.8 --> 885.8389999999999
hello aries cursor man

890.399 --> 894.92
hey dutch sailor good morning

904.72 --> 908.0790000000001
hey aries 106.

908.8 --> 912.5999999999999
losing its luster

917.44 --> 920.0
you think

920.639 --> 925.04
well it might be losing its novelty

925.36 --> 930.639
right it is a big part of it

927.839 --> 933.12
like a lot of energy does come from that

930.639 --> 934.8
shock switch moment

933.12 --> 936.32
but if there's a whole bunch of people

934.8 --> 939.8389999999999
that already went through that then

936.32 --> 939.839
eventually that energy

940.0 --> 944.32
feeds into his whole momentum it does

941.92 --> 947.199
kind of die down a little so it might be

944.32 --> 950.5600000000001
basically losing its novelty

947.199 --> 952.959
but it doesn't really matter though

950.56 --> 952.959
because

953.44 --> 959.12
we've basically taken a position in a

956.24 --> 959.12
whale in a way

960.32 --> 968.5600000000001
so even if flat earth itself is not

964.399 --> 971.279
super curious anymore

968.56 --> 973.3599999999999
there's plenty out there

971.279 --> 975.36
that flat earthers

973.36 --> 977.44
also deal with

975.36 --> 979.6800000000001
and are figuring out right it's almost

977.44 --> 981.2790000000001
like now that flat earth has been

979.68 --> 983.8389999999999
established

981.279 --> 983.8389999999999
as a

984.0 --> 988.639
societal

985.519 --> 991.92
not waited like a

988.639 --> 992.72
empire opposing lore

991.92 --> 995.36
now

992.72 --> 997.759
we're working harder on figuring out the

995.36 --> 1000.0
rest and there's a lot of mistakes being

997.759 --> 1000.0
made

1002.56 --> 1005.92
like

1003.519 --> 1008.24
diving straight into fear porn for

1005.92 --> 1012.3199999999999
example is a classic mistake basically

1008.24 --> 1016.16
on every front out there not just

1012.32 --> 1016.1600000000001
flat earth community it's everywhere

1016.32 --> 1021.36
right there's so many things that

1018.8 --> 1024.48
you're also handed

1021.36 --> 1027.199
where yeah if you if you go there you're

1024.48 --> 1029.919
handed complete fear books on what to be

1027.199 --> 1032.16
totally afraid of

1029.919 --> 1035.76
with all these situations and then yeah

1032.16 --> 1038.24
it's a very straightforward trap

1035.76 --> 1040.319
that your excitement will basically make

1038.24 --> 1043.28
you go there and then before you know it

1040.319 --> 1045.9189999999999
you're super depressed and paranoid

1043.28 --> 1049.12
and that wears on you

1045.919 --> 1050.8400000000001
influences your social life too so

1049.12 --> 1054.32
that's a big challenge

1050.84 --> 1058.3999999999999
universally that flat earthers are like

1054.32 --> 1058.3999999999999
pretty upfront tackling in many ways

1058.64 --> 1064.3200000000002
propaganda right we deal it with

1061.679 --> 1067.3200000000002
the empire with nasa and

1064.32 --> 1067.32
government

1067.44 --> 1070.16
government narrative

1069.36 --> 1074.24
and

1070.16 --> 1075.919
then we deal with everything right i am

1074.24 --> 1078.08
basically talking about that and i'm not

1075.919 --> 1079.76
the only one but i do focus a lot on it

1078.08 --> 1082.3999999999999
like how

1079.76 --> 1086.32
same patterns

1082.4 --> 1086.3200000000002
re-emerge in other fields

1086.4 --> 1091.3600000000001
the same effects

1088.559 --> 1094.8799999999999
start to see like

1091.36 --> 1096.9599999999998
like nothing is really unique

1094.88 --> 1100.24
so one of the things that i started to

1096.96 --> 1102.88
realize about that like and it does

1100.24 --> 1107.36
feed into the sensation we are really

1102.88 --> 1109.8400000000001
all one we just kind of got distracted

1107.36 --> 1109.84
anyway

1119.919 --> 1123.0
all right

1141.2 --> 1146.559
right aries so now it's in the face

1143.76 --> 1150.0
where it has to endure first it came out

1146.559 --> 1152.32
it was a shock it was a shield

1150.0 --> 1154.16
polarized situation a lot of friction a

1152.32 --> 1156.72
lot of people triggered

1154.16 --> 1158.64
now the novelty the shine is off a bit

1156.72 --> 1161.52
and now it's just kind of like an

1158.64 --> 1163.76
endurance run now we have to prove

1161.52 --> 1167.52
that in our opposition

1163.76 --> 1167.52
it is a durable opposition

1167.84 --> 1171.9189999999999
right we have to prove that we can all

1170.0 --> 1176.28
hold our ground

1171.919 --> 1176.2800000000002
even when the novelty is off

1194.559 --> 1198.08
you don't understand the patreon thing

1196.24 --> 1201.6
well it's it's like a

1198.08 --> 1201.6
monthly support system

1204.96 --> 1208.559
or a one-time donation thing

1214.559 --> 1219.2
but the funny thing about it is it's

1216.799 --> 1220.8799999999999
very easy to just say okay

1219.2 --> 1223.039
this amount every

1220.88 --> 1225.5200000000002
month

1223.039 --> 1227.84
and then you keep it set and it'll just

1225.52 --> 1230.72
automatically keep doing that right you

1227.84 --> 1232.799
don't you can't forget

1230.72 --> 1235.799
you can also forget to turn it off but

1232.799 --> 1235.799
yeah

1240.4 --> 1243.52
ah

1241.28 --> 1246.3999999999999
never check that alright well the link

1243.52 --> 1248.24
is in the in the description box below

1246.4 --> 1251.6000000000001
so

1248.24 --> 1251.6
you could check it out there

1260.559 --> 1266.799
right but you do have to make an account

1262.4 --> 1269.039
and link it to bank accounts etc etc so

1266.799 --> 1269.039
yeah

1269.44 --> 1272.3200000000002
check it out it's not a bad system it's

1271.44 --> 1275.3600000000001
been

1272.32 --> 1277.6789999999999
have it has had some problems here and

1275.36 --> 1278.799
there

1277.679 --> 1283.6000000000001
also

1278.799 --> 1283.6
through well that so is paypal basically

1285.28 --> 1289.6789999999999
like cutting people off because of

1287.2 --> 1292.0
political reasons patreon has done that

1289.679 --> 1294.5590000000002
well one of the

1292.0 --> 1296.64
cases that i know

1294.559 --> 1298.3999999999999
is with owen benjamin when they base

1296.64 --> 1300.7990000000002
yeah he was getting a lot through

1298.4 --> 1304.72
patreon and then patreon just kind of

1300.799 --> 1307.2
like didn't get yeah they cut him off

1304.72 --> 1308.159
it just monthly direct debit thing yeah

1307.2 --> 1311.64
yeah

1308.159 --> 1311.64
what's going on

1320.64 --> 1326.919
obs disconnected for some reason

1323.919 --> 1326.919
whatever

1339.84 --> 1344.32
you started buffering when you brought

1341.52 --> 1344.32
up the subject

1350.159 --> 1354.96
well i think that

1352.159 --> 1358.0800000000002
the parties of interest with those

1354.96 --> 1359.919
systems probably just don't want anybody

1358.08 --> 1361.039
to be reminded about i think that a lot

1359.919 --> 1364.0800000000002
of these

1361.039 --> 1366.32
issues come forth from

1364.08 --> 1367.76
very bad management decisions and it's

1366.32 --> 1369.84
an embarrassment

1367.76 --> 1372.559
in retrospect the more time passes the

1369.84 --> 1374.32
more embarrassed everybody is about that

1372.559 --> 1376.3999999999999
so they would just like everybody to

1374.32 --> 1378.72
forget about it and then

1376.4 --> 1381.919
hope it doesn't happen again

1378.72 --> 1381.919
if they're any smart

1383.679 --> 1387.679
because it's not in their own best

1385.12 --> 1391.0
interest to do such things like stay out

1387.679 --> 1391.0
of that nonsense

1409.919 --> 1412.919
so

1416.72 --> 1420.64
right but yeah that is technically true

1418.559 --> 1424.6399999999999
dusty writer

1420.64 --> 1424.64
that would help significantly

1424.88 --> 1428.7990000000002
yeah

1425.919 --> 1432.159
remember i originally made an assessment

1428.799 --> 1432.1589999999999
basically of what i needed

1433.679 --> 1439.3600000000001
and it is pretty much about

1436.799 --> 1441.2
300 euros

1439.36 --> 1443.9189999999999
a month

1441.2 --> 1446.64
that's kind of what i need to to be

1443.919 --> 1449.8400000000001
stable and not enter debt

1446.64 --> 1449.8400000000001
so yeah if i got

1450.4 --> 1452.88
what is it

1455.279 --> 1460.799
60 patreons that'll all donate like five

1458.4 --> 1462.96
euros every month

1460.799 --> 1464.08
then technically i wouldn't even have to

1462.96 --> 1466.32
ask for

1464.08 --> 1468.0
paypal donations anymore

1466.32 --> 1469.9189999999999
well wait it would have to be a little

1468.0 --> 1472.08
more because patreon does take out a

1469.919 --> 1473.44
percentage

1472.08 --> 1475.4399999999998
but

1473.44 --> 1477.44
you know what i mean

1475.44 --> 1480.96
yeah that's always been like oh but it

1477.44 --> 1480.96
could be so easy yeah

1481.12 --> 1484.84
it's not been happening though even

1482.88 --> 1489.44
though i do ask for

1484.84 --> 1491.84
it as to join patreon every show

1489.44 --> 1491.8400000000001
twice

1498.24 --> 1502.88
i'd love to see not worry about money

1501.52 --> 1504.96
what

1502.88 --> 1507.279
yeah i'd love to see me not worry about

1504.96 --> 1507.279
money

1508.4 --> 1511.279
that would be great

1511.84 --> 1514.8799999999999
then

1512.72 --> 1517.76
i'll get less stress

1514.88 --> 1520.3200000000002
i'll stop not eating and i'll suddenly

1517.76 --> 1523.36
also have money extra

1520.32 --> 1525.6789999999999
maybe a little to spare to actually then

1523.36 --> 1525.6789999999999
eat

1526.84 --> 1531.9189999999999
right when i get stressed out over money

1529.679 --> 1534.24
i typically lose my hunger

1531.919 --> 1536.7990000000002
which is ironically

1534.24 --> 1538.88
very efficient it does kind of make me

1536.799 --> 1541.12
help me pull through but if it's lasts

1538.88 --> 1544.64
too long then i really get weakened

1541.12 --> 1544.6399999999999
then i lose focus and all that

1545.36 --> 1550.7199999999998
right

1546.64 --> 1550.72
stressing out is just not healthy

1551.12 --> 1554.9599999999998
even though when i am like that i do

1552.88 --> 1557.7600000000002
kind of save money on food even just

1554.96 --> 1560.24
temporarily

1557.76 --> 1561.6
and i also like smoke less and all that

1560.24 --> 1563.6
because yeah if you don't have enough

1561.6 --> 1565.4399999999998
food in your system the impact is going

1563.6 --> 1568.08
to be too much

1565.44 --> 1572.0800000000002
so just everything just

1568.08 --> 1574.3999999999999
i focus more on distraction

1572.08 --> 1577.84
and i burn

1574.4 --> 1580.3200000000002
less everything less food less

1577.84 --> 1580.32
smokes

1581.84 --> 1587.799
anyway

1583.2 --> 1587.799
that's kind of like what happened to me

1602.4 --> 1605.2
you don't know that

1610.72 --> 1613.72
it's

1613.76 --> 1616.96
i mean

1615.2 --> 1619.52
i appreciate the offer though dutch

1616.96 --> 1621.2
taylor i'm afraid though it is

1619.52 --> 1623.76
a little complex

1621.2 --> 1627.72
it's not just like oh that that just

1623.76 --> 1627.72
makes everything easy

1629.039 --> 1633.6
because i don't know if i'd be able to

1630.72 --> 1636.24
basically script together money outside

1633.6 --> 1638.559
of welfare

1636.24 --> 1641.84
to get around

1638.559 --> 1641.84
that would be a bit of a risk

1642.399 --> 1646.8799999999999
but

1643.279 --> 1651.0
i appreciate the offer who knows

1646.88 --> 1651.0
what's going to happen in the future

1661.12 --> 1665.6
all right yeah that's cool

1663.12 --> 1669.7099999999998
i know you told me about that

1665.6 --> 1672.779
you're a good guy dutch seder

1669.71 --> 1672.779
[Music]

1677.16 --> 1680.8590000000002
[Music]

1698.48 --> 1702.88
it would go nuts on you for sure

1701.12 --> 1704.4799999999998
well

1702.88 --> 1706.5590000000002
yeah that's the thing

1704.48 --> 1709.279
we would probably get on each other's

1706.559 --> 1711.84
nerves nerves we are both high tension

1709.279 --> 1711.84
people

1720.799 --> 1726.08
i need my space

1723.039 --> 1729.919
i especially just need space where i

1726.08 --> 1731.12
have like true silence around me

1729.919 --> 1733.679
that

1731.12 --> 1735.76
i don't have to get the feeling anybody

1733.679 --> 1738.3200000000002
could bump into me and basically force a

1735.76 --> 1740.64
conversation out of me

1738.32 --> 1742.96
yeah in that sense i definitely need my

1740.64 --> 1742.96
space

1746.559 --> 1749.52
hey moon shadow

1751.44 --> 1754.72
that's my space all right

1757.44 --> 1760.64
and over here i'm good

1762.0 --> 1768.64
i'm like this place is is pretty good

1765.84 --> 1770.48
for me it's been

1768.64 --> 1772.3990000000001
it's funny because when i first arrived

1770.48 --> 1774.48
here there was just so much so many

1772.399 --> 1777.52
issues but it seems like most of them

1774.48 --> 1779.6
have just resolved

1777.52 --> 1782.32
there's no real problems here anymore

1779.6 --> 1786.24
and like even my landlord seems to have

1782.32 --> 1786.24
finally switched to a position

1786.399 --> 1789.84
where he's really not coming after me

1788.64 --> 1791.6000000000001
anymore

1789.84 --> 1794.08
and i have also

1791.6 --> 1796.48
i've arrived to a position where i am

1794.08 --> 1801.12
not gonna like completely go berserk

1796.48 --> 1801.1200000000001
again not that i ever like hurt anybody

1802.0 --> 1805.52
but i would basically just get so loud

1804.399 --> 1808.32
sometimes

1805.52 --> 1811.679
uncontrollably that it would like make

1808.32 --> 1814.32
people nervous and he was very he was

1811.679 --> 1816.0800000000002
like almost scared of that

1814.32 --> 1818.24
so that's not good it's not going to go

1816.08 --> 1822.399
there anymore it couldn't because that

1818.24 --> 1825.1200000000001
will that was really a an aftermath

1822.399 --> 1827.6789999999999
from the situation with my ex which like

1825.12 --> 1830.1589999999999
that breakup was like the most one of

1827.679 --> 1832.0800000000002
the most devastating transitions i've

1830.159 --> 1836.159
ever been through

1832.08 --> 1837.6
and it basically just took five years

1836.159 --> 1840.159
to get over that

1837.6 --> 1842.6399999999999
maybe six

1840.159 --> 1844.3990000000001
typical it was only a three year

1842.64 --> 1847.44
relationship

1844.399 --> 1847.4399999999998
and i needed six

1848.559 --> 1851.84
to restore from that

1859.12 --> 1865.799
do i prefer being alone

1861.2 --> 1865.799
well not completely alone moon shadow

1866.96 --> 1873.159
like i do have need sometimes to just

1869.6 --> 1873.1589999999999
connect with people

1879.2 --> 1883.8400000000001
because this sensation that i'm

1881.36 --> 1885.1999999999998
completely isolated and literally have

1883.84 --> 1887.36
no idea

1885.2 --> 1889.44
what is going on in the minds and the

1887.36 --> 1892.4799999999998
hearts of the people that basically

1889.44 --> 1893.919
directly surround me that is

1892.48 --> 1896.96
worse

1893.919 --> 1900.159
that's worse than being

1896.96 --> 1900.159
physically isolated

1901.36 --> 1907.0
like if people are going to be around i

1903.44 --> 1907.0
need to connect

1908.399 --> 1912.2399999999998
even if just

1910.0 --> 1914.559
superficial

1912.24 --> 1915.919
like doesn't have to be like oh we are

1914.559 --> 1918.48
going to build this kind of a

1915.919 --> 1920.3200000000002
partnership type of contact

1918.48 --> 1923.2
but just like there has to be an

1920.32 --> 1926.08
understanding like they have to get me

1923.2 --> 1926.0800000000002
and that's tough

1928.48 --> 1932.64
i am not such a straightforward

1930.48 --> 1936.08
individual compared to most it takes

1932.64 --> 1936.0800000000002
some getting used to in our win

1940.08 --> 1944.32
yes dustyrider yeah yeah i remember you

1942.24 --> 1947.32
brought that up yesterday i appreciate

1944.32 --> 1947.32
that

1952.48 --> 1958.159
who knows man maybe at some point i'll

1954.64 --> 1959.679
arrive in a situation where i could

1958.159 --> 1962.159
tour around

1959.679 --> 1964.5590000000002
just literally go and just start

1962.159 --> 1967.2
traveling from

1964.559 --> 1970.559
person to person

1967.2 --> 1970.559
just for the experience

1973.6 --> 1976.6399999999999
but i'm not gonna do it from a poverty

1975.44 --> 1979.2
position

1976.64 --> 1979.2
just no

1979.6 --> 1983.4399999999998
so right now

1982.0 --> 1985.76
it's

1983.44 --> 1987.039
it's currently out of the question

1985.76 --> 1990.919
but

1987.039 --> 1990.919
it is a nice idea

1998.0 --> 2000.399
anyway

2001.36 --> 2004.6
yeah let's

2004.72 --> 2010.88
let's talk about something

2007.76 --> 2012.559
i mean there's all this energy here

2010.88 --> 2014.72
got some things

2012.559 --> 2018.36
cleared up

2014.72 --> 2018.3600000000001
hey tony whitcomb

2023.6 --> 2025.9189999999999
what

2026.24 --> 2034.0
took me a year to get over my missus

2030.72 --> 2037.919
she was that fat

2034.0 --> 2037.919
i had to wear hiking boots i

2039.84 --> 2043.799
i hope that's a joke

2066.879 --> 2073.1189999999997
yeah that imagery that that conjured is

2069.839 --> 2074.879
kind of scary like a

2073.119 --> 2076.8790000000004
a woman so fat

2074.879 --> 2079.04
like if you didn't pay attention you

2076.879 --> 2082.72
just thought she'd be a hill

2079.04 --> 2082.72
with a woman sticking out of it

2086.8 --> 2092.079
i doubt that somebody could survive in

2088.8 --> 2092.079
that condition for very long

2092.72 --> 2095.919
oh god

2094.879 --> 2100.5989999999997
i don't

2095.919 --> 2100.5989999999997
know let's not get into it

2103.359 --> 2108.68
lucky you didn't fall into a crevice god

2139.599 --> 2143.839
dude now if a woman would be so fat

2141.839 --> 2145.7599999999998
she'd be a hill

2143.839 --> 2146.48
that crevice would not

2145.76 --> 2150.32
be

2146.48 --> 2154.0
reachable it would be completely

2150.32 --> 2157.28
at the bottom and you don't know what

2154.0 --> 2159.68
what that would be like there eventually

2157.28 --> 2159.6800000000003
you'll

2160.0 --> 2163.64
say no to crackers

2176.4 --> 2180.359
hey tasmanian truther

2191.92 --> 2195.7200000000003
mariana trench

2200.88 --> 2203.88
uh

2219.2 --> 2227.7999999999997
yeah the mariana trench is a bit like

2223.28 --> 2227.8
earth's butt crack isn't it

2229.04 --> 2233.52
and there is like i think there's like

2231.119 --> 2235.359
tubes with methane coming out there as

2233.52 --> 2239.2
well or was that another region might

2235.359 --> 2240.64
not be the mariana trench at the bottom

2239.2 --> 2243.839
[Music]

2240.64 --> 2243.839
it would be ironic though

2246.079 --> 2249.92
i i don't know exactly what is at the

2248.16 --> 2251.52
bottom of the mariana trench like what

2249.92 --> 2253.28
activity like is there even living

2251.52 --> 2255.7599999999998
creatures down there like what's going

2253.28 --> 2260.2400000000002
on down there i don't remember

2255.76 --> 2260.2400000000002
anyway hey mr cheswick good to see you

2267.92 --> 2271.64
no no no

2271.68 --> 2276.3999999999996
newtonian mechanics are just conceptual

2274.079 --> 2276.4
anyway

2283.76 --> 2286.5600000000004
weird fish down there

2285.52 --> 2290.599
right

2286.56 --> 2290.599
high pressure fish right

2302.96 --> 2307.76
i might have to look up like

2305.52 --> 2310.88
the nature documentary about the mariana

2307.76 --> 2313.5200000000004
trench there should be

2310.88 --> 2315.28
they should be out there on youtube like

2313.52 --> 2319.2
everything [ __ ] is probably out there on

2315.28 --> 2322.32
youtube concerning nature documentaries

2319.2 --> 2324.3999999999996
it's a freshen up

2322.32 --> 2327.44
refreshing my memory

2324.4 --> 2331.04
with all the new data to keep an eye out

2327.44 --> 2331.04
on what i'm actually looking at

2337.52 --> 2343.359
the diver hit the shore

2341.44 --> 2345.28
submersible and but

2343.359 --> 2348.24
that's not in the mariana trench though

2345.28 --> 2352.28
i think tony whitcomb i'm not 100 sure

2348.24 --> 2352.2799999999997
but i don't think it was there

2356.24 --> 2361.56
might be wrong

2358.16 --> 2361.56
remind me

2372.56 --> 2376.92
what are you talking about dusty ryder

2408.96 --> 2413.28
okay thanks for the link seeking style

2410.72 --> 2414.319
water but it doesn't actually have

2413.28 --> 2417.44
footage

2414.319 --> 2419.2799999999997
from the mariana trench

2417.44 --> 2422.28
but or any other it's just the

2419.28 --> 2422.28
description

2429.2 --> 2433.24
but

2430.24 --> 2433.24
anyway

2456.0 --> 2461.52
okay dusty where are you getting that

2457.68 --> 2461.52
rumor from i've never heard of that

2463.119 --> 2467.079
that sounds like a rumor

2491.32 --> 2495.44
[Music]

2492.88 --> 2495.44
what that

2500.96 --> 2503.359
dude

2507.04 --> 2510.64
oh i thought it was actually a video but

2509.119 --> 2512.2400000000002
it turned out to be freaking

2510.64 --> 2514.56
advertisement

2512.24 --> 2514.56
ugh

2517.28 --> 2521.2000000000003
like an actual full-blown advertisement

2519.599 --> 2523.04
video that had nothing to do with the

2521.2 --> 2525.4399999999996
subjects

2523.04 --> 2525.44
whatever

2532.56 --> 2536.56
i heard about that layer of water they

2534.64 --> 2538.72
couldn't penetrate

2536.56 --> 2540.0
well they couldn't but it can be

2538.72 --> 2543.1189999999997
penetrated

2540.0 --> 2543.119
like there's creatures

2543.76 --> 2551.079
that actually can go through it

2546.24 --> 2551.0789999999997
but they die because it's super saline

2556.24 --> 2562.52
what do i think about the discussion on

2558.56 --> 2562.52
sex scenes well it's hilarious

2564.319 --> 2570.16
i mean it's just

2566.48 --> 2572.56
dead straight on proof

2570.16 --> 2574.56
that the earth is not spherical

2572.56 --> 2578.119
because then it wouldn't work

2574.56 --> 2578.119
it's very straightforward

2579.04 --> 2582.96
and the ballers are having a lot of

2580.96 --> 2585.359
issue trying to

2582.96 --> 2589.599
rectify this with machinations like it

2585.359 --> 2589.5989999999997
because it's so staring you in the face

2589.76 --> 2594.48
that they can really not tenably do

2593.119 --> 2596.8
anything with it

2594.48 --> 2599.52
just mutter and

2596.8 --> 2600.4
buffoon around like bob the science guy

2599.52 --> 2605.88
tried

2600.4 --> 2605.88
it's just so clunky so obviously wrong

2609.68 --> 2615.319
but that's not stopping them from trying

2612.16 --> 2615.319
of course

2626.72 --> 2631.24
as above so below what

2637.68 --> 2641.0789999999997
what do you mean

2654.4 --> 2657.7200000000003
hey clutch

2685.599 --> 2690.48
yeah tony whitcomb

2687.28 --> 2692.4
james mason that's rumors that is

2690.48 --> 2694.72
nothing but rumors

2692.4 --> 2694.7200000000003
really

2694.8 --> 2701.78
it came on to the scene very early

2698.4 --> 2703.2000000000003
at the beginning 2015 and

2701.78 --> 2705.8390000000004
[Music]

2703.2 --> 2705.839
way before

2706.04 --> 2710.96
specifically remember

2708.48 --> 2712.8
having seen it

2710.96 --> 2715.2
having been shown it

2712.8 --> 2715.2000000000003
was it

2715.44 --> 2720.7200000000003
somewhere between 1997 and 2001

2720.96 --> 2724.96
because it was originally just part of a

2722.96 --> 2726.64
documentary it's not like a youtube

2724.96 --> 2728.48
video it was part of a nature document

2726.64 --> 2730.64
that's when i saw it and i was like

2728.48 --> 2732.72
what's that

2730.64 --> 2735.68
holy [ __ ]

2732.72 --> 2735.68
just blew my mind

2737.119 --> 2741.28
but

2738.56 --> 2743.2799999999997
it's not the waters below

2741.28 --> 2744.8
was that's

2743.28 --> 2747.44
yeah that's like

2744.8 --> 2748.1600000000003
biblical suggestion

2747.44 --> 2750.64
but

2748.16 --> 2752.0
i i'm not buying that not saying that oh

2750.64 --> 2754.24
the bible is wrong i'm just saying

2752.0 --> 2756.8
that's not what that is

2754.24 --> 2759.2799999999997
and i'm damn sure there is no physical

2756.8 --> 2761.8390000000004
layer of water

2759.28 --> 2763.119
just hanging over us

2761.839 --> 2766.64
either

2763.119 --> 2770.119
right it's very fantastical imagination

2766.64 --> 2770.1189999999997
there's no evidence

2778.88 --> 2783.839
i mean it might

2780.319 --> 2786.4
turn out to be in some way

2783.839 --> 2788.88
that it could be figured out

2786.4 --> 2790.96
with halfway decent empirical evidence

2788.88 --> 2794.0
to prove there's water

2790.96 --> 2796.2400000000002
a layer of water beyond the dome or

2794.0 --> 2798.88
whatever that barrier should be because

2796.24 --> 2801.68
we have gas pressure

2798.88 --> 2802.4
but to just outright claim it

2801.68 --> 2804.7999999999997
like

2802.4 --> 2806.1600000000003
without good evidence in my opinion is

2804.8 --> 2808.7200000000003
just

2806.16 --> 2809.7599999999998
wasting your time

2808.72 --> 2813.2
and

2809.76 --> 2815.0400000000004
that supposed impenetrable layer is not

2813.2 --> 2817.2799999999997
impenetrable

2815.04 --> 2820.319
it just isn't

2817.28 --> 2822.079
it is penetrable it's just super thick

2820.319 --> 2825.2799999999997
saline water

2822.079 --> 2829.319
and a big body can't just push through

2825.28 --> 2829.3190000000004
it it's not gonna give way

2831.2 --> 2833.7599999999998
right

2832.88 --> 2836.96
the

2833.76 --> 2840.48
the des equilibrium or artificially

2836.96 --> 2843.119
forced pressure is not enough to make it

2840.48 --> 2845.839
move past it would be like trying to

2843.119 --> 2849.359
push yourself

2845.839 --> 2852.96
into sand without pulling it apart like

2849.359 --> 2854.96
that doesn't work it's too dense

2852.96 --> 2856.559
it's not going to give way under that

2854.96 --> 2858.88
pressure

2856.559 --> 2861.3590000000004
right but you could

2858.88 --> 2864.079
burrow your way through

2861.359 --> 2866.96
and i think that is effectively the same

2864.079 --> 2868.48
function with that super saline water

2866.96 --> 2871.68
that with that

2868.48 --> 2873.359
submarine bounce situation

2871.68 --> 2874.7999999999997
like yeah that doesn't mean it's

2873.359 --> 2877.44
impenetrable it just means that the

2874.8 --> 2880.079
submarine can't dive into it it's not

2877.44 --> 2880.079
giving way

2880.319 --> 2884.839
that's my opinion about that

2895.2 --> 2901.7599999999998
seen dr john these latest videos double

2897.92 --> 2906.2000000000003
state no i must have missed that

2901.76 --> 2906.2000000000003
i don't know if i have him bell notified

2918.079 --> 2923.92
oh wait is that the one laser source

2920.96 --> 2923.92
splitter video

2924.4 --> 2928.599
i didn't actually watch it

2930.4 --> 2936.319
i skipped it

2932.4 --> 2936.319
i wasn't in the mood for all the time

2937.68 --> 2940.68
interesting

2950.88 --> 2954.96
all right it's not super long video i i

2953.04 --> 2957.839
should take a look at that thanks for

2954.96 --> 2957.839
the reminder

2963.92 --> 2968.559
all right tony i do my best i tried to

2966.16 --> 2973.1189999999997
get look there's just a lot of these

2968.559 --> 2973.119
typical things that get thrown at you

2973.28 --> 2978.96
but there's also it's like in

2976.079 --> 2981.8390000000004
easy jump to conclusion situations that

2978.96 --> 2982.88
people do and they like it

2981.839 --> 2984.96
and that's

2982.88 --> 2986.88
like i keep track of

2984.96 --> 2989.44
how it is mistakes and what i think it

2986.88 --> 2989.44
really is

2989.68 --> 2993.44
and yes the

2991.599 --> 2996.0
the impenetrable

2993.44 --> 3000.4
layer beneath the ocean has been brought

2996.0 --> 3000.4
up many many times over the years so

3002.4 --> 3008.0
i know that one by now i know what that

3004.559 --> 3011.48
is and i know the mistakes about it

3008.0 --> 3011.48
it's not impenetrable

3014.48 --> 3018.319
it is a fascinating phenomenon though

3017.119 --> 3021.28
like

3018.319 --> 3023.359
i'm much more boggled in general like

3021.28 --> 3025.3590000000004
why does it do that

3023.359 --> 3027.5989999999997
how does it stay separate like that

3025.359 --> 3029.2799999999997
that's that's the more mind-boggling

3027.599 --> 3031.04
part to me

3029.28 --> 3034.559
it's like whoa

3031.04 --> 3036.16
i don't understand how nature

3034.559 --> 3038.7200000000003
makes it work like this i don't

3036.16 --> 3038.72
understand

3039.44 --> 3041.839
yet

3044.0 --> 3048.079
like in ways it's just counterintuitive

3046.079 --> 3051.28
the water would do that

3048.079 --> 3051.28
two different types of water

3053.359 --> 3056.24
or rather that

3056.319 --> 3062.16
super saiyan water would be so different

3059.68 --> 3063.9199999999996
from not super saline water like that it

3062.16 --> 3066.3999999999996
would be fundamentally different that it

3063.92 --> 3068.96
would respond to other water as if it

3066.4 --> 3071.6800000000003
wasn't the same

3068.96 --> 3075.7200000000003
that part is is really like

3071.68 --> 3075.72
puzzling to me interesting

3098.48 --> 3105.359
stars look like lights underwater uh

3103.04 --> 3107.04
they look like lights

3105.359 --> 3110.4
in the air

3107.04 --> 3111.599
they are all lights

3110.4 --> 3113.44
they're lights

3111.599 --> 3117.96
i that's a very

3113.44 --> 3117.96
weird thing to say james mason

3144.24 --> 3149.72
uh you're another round of goat curry

3146.559 --> 3149.7200000000003
are you

3152.16 --> 3155.16
hmm

3181.68 --> 3184.0
what

3185.44 --> 3190.079
like an ice fishing hole during the day

3188.0 --> 3192.96
from the inside

3190.079 --> 3197.44
from inside the dark shack

3192.96 --> 3197.44
okay that's a very visual description i

3200.16 --> 3205.44
to be fair i've never actually been

3202.64 --> 3208.0789999999997
under water

3205.44 --> 3210.8
underneath ice looking upward at a

3208.079 --> 3213.2000000000003
fishing hole

3210.8 --> 3217.559
so i don't know the how that looks like

3213.2 --> 3217.5589999999997
i have to take your word for it

3226.88 --> 3229.2000000000003
yeah

3229.28 --> 3234.4
hey good surfing

3231.359 --> 3237.5989999999997
why don't you just say hello

3234.4 --> 3240.1600000000003
i don't want you to to start entry with

3237.599 --> 3242.079
some kind of virtue signal like you're

3240.16 --> 3243.839
in afraid you're gonna get banned or

3242.079 --> 3246.1600000000003
something this is getting on my nerves

3243.839 --> 3246.16
dude

3246.8 --> 3250.6800000000003
just say hello

3265.44 --> 3268.67
[Music]

3283.44 --> 3287.76
fine good servant if that's what you

3285.52 --> 3290.799
wish for me that's

3287.76 --> 3292.88
fine it's just really awkward when you

3290.799 --> 3295.68
enter my chat

3292.88 --> 3297.92
with saying that

3295.68 --> 3300.3999999999996
right

3297.92 --> 3303.04
when people

3300.4 --> 3305.2000000000003
enter somebody's social communication

3303.04 --> 3306.5589999999997
space whether it's in physical world or

3305.2 --> 3309.4399999999996
in a chat

3306.559 --> 3310.799
you just say hello you don't enter like

3309.44 --> 3315.44
oh i'm

3310.799 --> 3315.44
i wish you the best that's just awkward

3317.76 --> 3321.0
it's awkward

3322.16 --> 3328.2
gives a flare that you're somehow afraid

3325.04 --> 3328.2
of something

3340.079 --> 3345.319
if i got him a yeti microphone yeah yeah

3342.16 --> 3345.319
i do

3350.0 --> 3354.839
you do that all the time matthew hall do

3351.839 --> 3354.839
you

3367.44 --> 3370.599
all right

3386.88 --> 3390.6400000000003
hey infinite loops larson

3393.839 --> 3398.359
and rest ahead

3395.359 --> 3398.359
lou

3413.68 --> 3418.04
all right

3414.64 --> 3418.04
that's great

3427.599 --> 3433.1600000000003
it's just that there will be no chanting

3430.079 --> 3433.1600000000003
in here

3440.48 --> 3444.799
what is this subject uh nothing really

3442.96 --> 3447.839
in particular it's been kind of over the

3444.799 --> 3447.839
place we were talking about

3449.359 --> 3451.68
ugh

3451.839 --> 3455.359
it

3453.119 --> 3458.079
very strange train

3455.359 --> 3461.839
of subjects but we ended up with like uh

3458.079 --> 3461.8390000000004
super saiyan water

3465.76 --> 3469.5200000000004
and how people think that it is

3470.319 --> 3474.64
a barrier and it isn't

3472.72 --> 3477.1189999999997
and then you have stars talking about

3474.64 --> 3477.1189999999997
stars

3478.16 --> 3483.8799999999997
i guess sort of somebody brought that up

3480.16 --> 3483.8799999999997
i addressed it once

3497.44 --> 3500.559
gregorian

3499.04 --> 3503.839
chanting

3500.559 --> 3503.8390000000004
now that's singing

3511.2 --> 3515.4399999999996
yeah but if you're gonna grigori enchant

3513.92 --> 3518.16
those things

3515.44 --> 3521.28
those specific things that i

3518.16 --> 3523.7599999999998
philosophically oppose

3521.28 --> 3525.52
then this is just the same

3523.76 --> 3527.3590000000004
right

3525.52 --> 3529.7599999999998
it doesn't matter how beautiful you

3527.359 --> 3532.48
present these chants they're chants and

3529.76 --> 3532.48
they don't want them

3533.119 --> 3538.2000000000003
you're just being a smart ass yeah so am

3535.2 --> 3538.2
i

3544.96 --> 3548.92
hello marquee wise

3578.319 --> 3582.599
okay flatter science

3588.319 --> 3593.2
if that is

3589.68 --> 3595.2799999999997
the range of the subject

3593.2 --> 3599.799
i don't know

3595.28 --> 3599.799
i don't see any flat earth in there

3601.44 --> 3607.76
that looks very infowarsy

3605.04 --> 3607.7599999999998
on that level

3608.48 --> 3612.319
what you just

3610.0 --> 3616.72
mentioned there

3612.319 --> 3619.92
911 chemtrails harp the new world order

3616.72 --> 3621.5989999999997
the monetary system ufos and aliens and

3619.92 --> 3625.88
government cover-ups yeah that pretty

3621.599 --> 3625.88
much summarizes infowars

3650.079 --> 3653.76
you could say that those are the

3654.48 --> 3660.0
conspiracy theorist alternative news

3657.68 --> 3663.9199999999996
speaking points of

3660.0 --> 3666.96
the first decade of this century

3663.92 --> 3668.96
that's when those were

3666.96 --> 3671.359
making headway

3668.96 --> 3673.2
get like that that was the break out of

3671.359 --> 3677.2
that

3673.2 --> 3677.2
but these things are kind of

3678.96 --> 3681.76
settled now

3682.559 --> 3685.7200000000003
i mean

3687.92 --> 3692.0
geoengineering chemtrails has just been

3690.319 --> 3694.16
admitted the new world order is

3692.0 --> 3696.24
literally coming out of the shadows and

3694.16 --> 3698.3999999999996
just getting blatant

3696.24 --> 3701.359
it's blatantly obvious the monastery

3698.4 --> 3702.96
system is manipulating the [ __ ] out of

3701.359 --> 3705.119
everything

3702.96 --> 3708.559
in order to create a

3705.119 --> 3712.04
well an open conspiracy of power

3708.559 --> 3712.0400000000004
and mind control

3713.2 --> 3717.7599999999998
ufos and aliens are pretty much to

3716.24 --> 3722.0789999999997
mainline

3717.76 --> 3724.079
exposed as being psyops

3722.079 --> 3726.88
with loose ends

3724.079 --> 3729.039
hidden technology

3726.88 --> 3732.079
and government cover-ups yeah well

3729.039 --> 3734.48
that's just the baseline narrative now

3732.079 --> 3736.799
by now

3734.48 --> 3738.16
it's like

3736.799 --> 3741.839
governments

3738.16 --> 3741.839
do that all the time

3745.28 --> 3751.2000000000003
so all these things were kind of new

3748.4 --> 3753.119
20 years ago

3751.2 --> 3755.839
now they are kind of like baseline

3753.119 --> 3755.839
knowledge

3757.92 --> 3761.44
infowars did a good flat earth piece did

3760.48 --> 3763.839
they

3761.44 --> 3765.68
did they

3763.839 --> 3769.52
i mean they've had some interesting

3765.68 --> 3771.68
interactions there eddie bravo on there

3769.52 --> 3771.68
and

3772.72 --> 3779.5989999999997
joe rogan and owen benjamin and david

3776.0 --> 3783.119
weiss i remember them on there

3779.599 --> 3784.7200000000003
but yeah they didn't really get anywhere

3783.119 --> 3787.2000000000003
usually the

3784.72 --> 3789.4399999999996
the sharing point would be yeah

3787.2 --> 3791.1189999999997
everybody deserves to free speech free

3789.44 --> 3793.599
ideas and

3791.119 --> 3796.1600000000003
against censorship right if you send to

3793.599 --> 3797.119
me then you will be censored next right

3796.16 --> 3798.96
that

3797.119 --> 3802.0
that would always be like the the

3798.96 --> 3804.2400000000002
sharing ground between it because

3802.0 --> 3806.319
nobody there is really gonna say like

3804.24 --> 3809.2799999999997
yeah yeah yeah yeah you're totally right

3806.319 --> 3812.4
it is it is just flat that nobody's

3809.28 --> 3814.6400000000003
doing that they're they're all like yeah

3812.4 --> 3816.88
we accept it we get it

3814.64 --> 3819.52
but we're not going there

3816.88 --> 3821.52
like even if the flat earther is right

3819.52 --> 3825.839
there in the studio and they're still

3821.52 --> 3825.839
just gonna resist it

3832.0 --> 3835.599
multiple gatekeepers

3836.48 --> 3841.119
well they hold the line

3838.64 --> 3841.1189999999997
it's like

3842.24 --> 3846.1189999999997
it's like boomer protection

3853.2 --> 3860.64
and at that yes it is gatekeeping

3857.44 --> 3862.799
they are corralling certain people

3860.64 --> 3866.1189999999997
that do not want to be confronted with

3862.799 --> 3866.119
flat earth

3867.359 --> 3872.96
they are providing food

3869.68 --> 3874.64
without all that info without going too

3872.96 --> 3877.2
far

3874.64 --> 3879.44
and that's that's their gate that's what

3877.2 --> 3881.2799999999997
they that's their place on the staircase

3879.44 --> 3884.2400000000002
right and it's up to the individual

3881.28 --> 3886.559
bumping into it whether they say this is

3884.24 --> 3888.16
reality or whether they figure out like

3886.559 --> 3889.92
wait this

3888.16 --> 3892.96
is a reality up to this point and they

3889.92 --> 3894.96
don't like to go further so if you want

3892.96 --> 3898.079
to go further you're have gonna have to

3894.96 --> 3898.079
find it somewhere else

3898.64 --> 3901.64
right

3921.28 --> 3925.119
is david like a gatekeeper

3928.88 --> 3931.76
sorta

3930.0 --> 3934.799
kind of in the same way

3931.76 --> 3937.8390000000004
he is definitely a guy that doesn't go

3934.799 --> 3937.839
to flat earth

3938.48 --> 3941.44
publicly i don't think he'll ever go

3940.64 --> 3943.92
there

3941.44 --> 3947.119
but beside that

3943.92 --> 3950.559
he's been kind of like a

3947.119 --> 3953.92
another angle to the awakening i think

3950.559 --> 3953.92
he's done a lot of good

3956.48 --> 3960.4
but

3957.28 --> 3961.76
yeah he is kind of like mixing up in the

3960.4 --> 3964.839
soup

3961.76 --> 3964.8390000000004
a bit

3972.559 --> 3979.079
but yeah he's been very on point about

3975.039 --> 3979.079
the c and the v situation

3979.52 --> 3985.52
it is apparent that he is developing

3982.96 --> 3987.039
his insights

3985.52 --> 3990.0
he's not just

3987.039 --> 3992.3190000000004
only repeating the same old [ __ ] he is

3990.0 --> 3994.88
developing it is very apparent when you

3992.319 --> 3994.88
keep track

3996.0 --> 4000.48
ike says

3997.599 --> 4000.48
he is jesus

4001.359 --> 4006.839
well i think he was speaking in parables

4003.28 --> 4006.8390000000004
when he said that

4011.839 --> 4014.839
now

4023.839 --> 4027.92
garrett ike

4026.0 --> 4030.92
who's that is that like his son or

4027.92 --> 4030.92
something

4055.28 --> 4058.28
what

4062.48 --> 4065.28
what the hell

4065.52 --> 4069.52
why is that message not removing

4071.92 --> 4078.2400000000002
i literally timed them out but i can't

4074.16 --> 4082.52
remove it as it it reappeared

4078.24 --> 4082.52
and now i can't remove it

4098.56 --> 4102.96
ah now it finally got

4101.359 --> 4105.839
weird

4102.96 --> 4105.839
whatever

4108.799 --> 4114.08
tyrion is an og in the conspiracy realm

4111.199 --> 4114.08
yeah yeah he's been

4114.96 --> 4119.679
doing his own development for a long

4117.04 --> 4121.92
time

4119.679 --> 4124.2390000000005
i haven't followed him in a long while

4121.92 --> 4124.2390000000005
though

4124.96 --> 4129.199
but he did came to my attention like 10

4127.279 --> 4131.679
years ago a lot

4129.199 --> 4134.0
also through alex jones who did have him

4131.679 --> 4134.96
on occasionally and like he was in end

4134.0 --> 4137.6
game

4134.96 --> 4137.6
that movie

4140.56 --> 4144.96
but was taking the piss out of fl yeah

4143.04 --> 4147.199
just

4144.96 --> 4149.199
can you blame him though you know mr

4147.199 --> 4151.599999999999
cheswick

4149.199 --> 4154.5599999999995
like when you don't actually get into

4151.6 --> 4156.64
flat earth and then you look at like

4154.56 --> 4159.04
what's going on on the internet between

4156.64 --> 4160.64
some flat earthers and ballers

4159.04 --> 4162.0
yeah what do you think

4160.64 --> 4163.1990000000005
you're going to feel about it you're

4162.0 --> 4165.12
going to feel

4163.199 --> 4167.839
jesus christ that's

4165.12 --> 4172.0
like these people are mental

4167.839 --> 4172.0
they're like totally anti-social

4172.04 --> 4177.12
blabbermouthing idiots all of them both

4174.96 --> 4178.4800000000005
sides

4177.12 --> 4180.0
like

4178.48 --> 4182.239
i get it

4180.0 --> 4185.12
if you are not getting into flat earth

4182.239 --> 4187.839
then it's very difficult to

4185.12 --> 4189.3589999999995
immediately see through the layer of

4187.839 --> 4191.679
madness

4189.359 --> 4195.319
that also typically surrounds it where

4191.679 --> 4195.319
people get stuck

4208.48 --> 4214.08
oh geez alan what oh is he still around

4211.199 --> 4216.719
i remember alan what alan what is

4214.08 --> 4218.719
amazing it's bizarre now that you

4216.719 --> 4220.96
mention his name i'm remembering i

4218.719 --> 4223.28
almost forgot about him

4220.96 --> 4226.159
but he's been on camera saying some like

4223.28 --> 4228.32
really fascinating things

4226.159 --> 4231.48
it's been a long time since i last heard

4228.32 --> 4231.48
from him

4261.92 --> 4265.52
to prevent you

4264.159 --> 4268.32
you cat

4265.52 --> 4268.320000000001
i disagree

4268.56 --> 4274.96
i utterly disagree

4272.48 --> 4277.199
in the context that we even know

4274.96 --> 4279.84
gatekeepers like that

4277.199 --> 4282.32
right a gate an actual gatekeeper

4279.84 --> 4284.96
actively shames people that want to

4282.32 --> 4286.719
engage in the subject the very personal

4284.96 --> 4288.719
peer pressurey way

4286.719 --> 4291.28
to actually dissuade them from

4288.719 --> 4292.64
continuing inquiry

4291.28 --> 4295.44
yeah

4292.64 --> 4298.56
when you just choose to have your show

4295.44 --> 4302.239
format not address certain subjects

4298.56 --> 4304.2390000000005
that's not that sort of gatekeeping

4302.239 --> 4307.44
it just means that's not the subject

4304.239 --> 4310.799999999999
here we don't talk about that here

4307.44 --> 4313.799999999999
it's not necessarily the same thing

4310.8 --> 4313.8
right

4318.239 --> 4322.879999999999
like actual gatekeeping

4321.28 --> 4326.08
happens

4322.88 --> 4328.8
in mainstream corporate news

4326.08 --> 4331.04
that's where they literally gatekeep

4328.8 --> 4334.320000000001
because half their time they're spending

4331.04 --> 4336.719
on making it all trendy shaming the

4334.32 --> 4339.12
political opposition

4336.719 --> 4342.08
now that's gatekeeping

4339.12 --> 4344.8
constantly non-stop gatekeeping that's

4342.08 --> 4347.6
the actual gatekeeping

4344.8 --> 4350.400000000001
oh [ __ ] ellen what passed away

4347.6 --> 4350.400000000001
oh damn it

4351.12 --> 4354.159
may you rest in peace

4355.12 --> 4358.12
huh

4370.159 --> 4375.04
but i want you all to consider that

4372.159 --> 4378.639999999999
right because this gatekeeper word is

4375.04 --> 4382.0
just becoming like the shill word

4378.64 --> 4384.8
it's rumorous slander

4382.0 --> 4387.44
and it makes it breeds paranoia

4384.8 --> 4389.92
and disengagement it is effectively gate

4387.44 --> 4393.199
keeping to call everybody shills and

4389.92 --> 4394.64
gatekeepers yeah how ironic is that huh

4393.199 --> 4397.5199999999995
huh

4394.64 --> 4399.679
yeah it is it actually is

4397.52 --> 4402.320000000001
you want to be a gatekeeper it's very

4399.679 --> 4405.52
simple you start pointing at individuals

4402.32 --> 4406.4
and calling them gatekeeper and chills

4405.52 --> 4408.4800000000005
yeah

4406.4 --> 4410.839999999999
now you're a gatekeeper isn't that

4408.48 --> 4413.44
ironic it's almost

4410.84 --> 4415.6
paradoxical but it is true though

4413.44 --> 4418.48
because that is shaming that is sowing

4415.6 --> 4421.4400000000005
doubt and fear that is actively gonna

4418.48 --> 4424.959999999999
see so doubt

4421.44 --> 4427.839999999999
causing statistical evasion

4424.96 --> 4427.84
that's gatekeeping

4434.32 --> 4437.32
ah

4445.6 --> 4449.52
fox news will never speak out on flat

4447.36 --> 4452.839999999999
earth that's well they do sometimes

4449.52 --> 4455.84
mention it but only to shame it

4452.84 --> 4458.400000000001
right gatekeeping doesn't really work

4455.84 --> 4460.32
when there is no shaming of the thing

4458.4 --> 4462.96
being gate kept

4460.32 --> 4466.159
gatekeeping is almost like

4462.96 --> 4467.44
putting subjects in a prison and saying

4466.159 --> 4469.839999999999
bad

4467.44 --> 4472.48
they need to be in prison you don't want

4469.84 --> 4474.2390000000005
to be like that it's bad

4472.48 --> 4476.4
don't do that

4474.239 --> 4478.799999999999
and then get very gross

4476.4 --> 4480.719
maybe even use it as a scapegoat for

4478.8 --> 4482.56
frustrations concerning other things

4480.719 --> 4485.36
right they blame them

4482.56 --> 4487.76
like why do you have to bring it up

4485.36 --> 4490.08
you're ruining everything by bringing

4487.76 --> 4493.04
that up well

4490.08 --> 4495.5199999999995
these types of sayings should be very

4493.04 --> 4497.92
familiar to you if you ever watched any

4495.52 --> 4500.159000000001
corporate news because they constantly

4497.92 --> 4502.719
do that

4500.159 --> 4504.48
and i don't even constantly watch

4502.719 --> 4506.719
mainstream news

4504.48 --> 4509.28
in order to know that

4506.719 --> 4511.76
it's just that every single time

4509.28 --> 4515.44
anything i get to see anything from

4511.76 --> 4517.679
mainstream news it's always that [ __ ]

4515.44 --> 4519.919999999999
every time

4517.679 --> 4521.76
so yeah you don't need to constantly

4519.92 --> 4523.4400000000005
watch it to know that

4521.76 --> 4524.64
you just have to need a couple of things

4523.44 --> 4527.04
and then you

4524.64 --> 4531.12
you start to see their spiel you start

4527.04 --> 4531.12
to see what they do they gate keep

4533.6 --> 4537.8
they gate keep and program

4542.96 --> 4547.04
so yeah

4544.4 --> 4549.44
the word gatekeeper just like chill is

4547.04 --> 4551.12
being overplayed

4549.44 --> 4553.36
it's like oh you don't want to talk

4551.12 --> 4556.32
about this subject that means you're a

4553.36 --> 4559.12
gatekeeper no it doesn't

4556.32 --> 4559.12
no it doesn't

4561.44 --> 4566.32
right gatekeeping

4563.92 --> 4568.88
demands

4566.32 --> 4570.639999999999
active counter response

4568.88 --> 4571.92
usually based on peer pressure

4570.64 --> 4574.0
techniques

4571.92 --> 4576.08
that's gate keeping if you just don't

4574.0 --> 4578.159
want to talk about something on whatever

4576.08 --> 4580.64
you're doing that's not necessarily

4578.159 --> 4583.04
gatekeeping

4580.64 --> 4583.04
could be

4583.36 --> 4588.719
you know if they do if you do break it

4585.52 --> 4590.2390000000005
open and they do start to shame you

4588.719 --> 4592.08
for it

4590.239 --> 4593.678999999999
then it becomes kind of gatekeeping but

4592.08 --> 4597.199
if you just don't address things it is

4593.679 --> 4597.1990000000005
not necessarily gatekeeping

4602.96 --> 4606.96
active dissuasion

4604.8 --> 4609.04
is required to be

4606.96 --> 4610.2390000000005
a gatekeeper in my

4609.04 --> 4612.239
view

4610.239 --> 4614.5599999999995
and i think i'm pretty on target about

4612.239 --> 4614.5599999999995
this

4615.28 --> 4619.04
if you're worth millions you're probably

4617.199 --> 4621.04
a gatekeeper

4619.04 --> 4622.8
well yeah because what do gatekeepers do

4621.04 --> 4624.159
they prevent people from going in a

4622.8 --> 4626.88
certain direction and then you

4624.159 --> 4629.44
effectively corral them

4626.88 --> 4632.08
you put a fence around it like around

4629.44 --> 4636.719
that subject and then make everything in

4632.08 --> 4639.76
there afraid to go outside of the gates

4636.719 --> 4642.0
and people on when they do that you

4639.76 --> 4643.4400000000005
gotta stop

4642.0 --> 4646.239
guess what

4643.44 --> 4648.159
outsiders are the grabblers we'll see

4646.239 --> 4649.678999999999
and they will say oh what if you do this

4648.159 --> 4652.799999999999
what do you maybe you could use them to

4649.679 --> 4655.76
sell this maybe yeah

4652.8 --> 4655.76
that then happens

4658.08 --> 4662.84
it gets grabble

4660.96 --> 4664.4
gatekeeping is for

4662.84 --> 4668.159000000001
grappling

4664.4 --> 4670.5599999999995
is to turn people into livestock

4668.159 --> 4670.5599999999995
and then

4671.04 --> 4677.48
extract actions

4673.04 --> 4677.48
or money support out of them

4679.76 --> 4683.52
but you do it

4681.199 --> 4683.5199999999995
through

4684.32 --> 4689.84
taking away information by discouraging

4687.52 --> 4692.159000000001
critical thought

4689.84 --> 4694.0
using peer pressure to convince people

4692.159 --> 4697.5599999999995
rather than

4694.0 --> 4697.56
logical inquiry

4713.6 --> 4718.88
if being a show means you get paid

4716.64 --> 4721.6
i wish i was one

4718.88 --> 4723.92
not really because a real shield you

4721.6 --> 4725.280000000001
know a shield is another thing it's so

4723.92 --> 4728.32
overplayed

4725.28 --> 4730.88
oh everybody's a shield no they aren't

4728.32 --> 4735.04
what actually is a shield is a paid

4730.88 --> 4738.0
actor a paid support actor what usually

4735.04 --> 4740.0
signifies them is that they're not into

4738.0 --> 4742.4
the subject

4740.0 --> 4743.44
that's what makes a real shield a real

4742.4 --> 4746.239
shill

4743.44 --> 4749.5199999999995
is just doing it for the money they

4746.239 --> 4751.5199999999995
literally don't care about it

4749.52 --> 4753.1990000000005
that's when it really becomes a shield

4751.52 --> 4755.280000000001
and that's when it gets that

4753.199 --> 4758.28
that certain flair like they're not into

4755.28 --> 4758.28
it

4763.679 --> 4766.8
right

4764.64 --> 4770.08
people that are passionate about

4766.8 --> 4772.4800000000005
something constantly that develop their

4770.08 --> 4772.48
thoughts

4772.719 --> 4776.88
about it

4774.4 --> 4780.199
that can't be a shill because they're

4776.88 --> 4780.1990000000005
into it

4792.0 --> 4795.84
so a gatekeeper will keep you looking at

4794.4 --> 4799.5199999999995
chemtrails

4795.84 --> 4799.52
instead of flat earth for example

4801.84 --> 4805.84
maybe

4802.84 --> 4808.56
yeah could be

4805.84 --> 4810.639
if they are actively shaming flat earth

4808.56 --> 4812.8
or if they're saying like oh

4810.639 --> 4813.679
your stupid distractions about the flat

4812.8 --> 4814.8
earth

4813.679 --> 4818.639
it is

4814.8 --> 4820.56
a distraction so you don't squirt over

4818.639 --> 4821.76
panic about how the world is being

4820.56 --> 4825.4400000000005
destroyed

4821.76 --> 4828.08
right now that's gatekeeping

4825.44 --> 4830.879999999999
but if they're just like hey dude i

4828.08 --> 4833.04
don't give a [ __ ] i i am into like the

4830.88 --> 4833.92
chemical substance of the chemtrails and

4833.04 --> 4835.76
then

4833.92 --> 4838.8
journalistic i have people that have

4835.76 --> 4841.360000000001
sneaked into airports and then made live

4838.8 --> 4844.0
footage of this i don't want to bring up

4841.36 --> 4845.44
flat earth okay this is not about that's

4844.0 --> 4849.159
not gatekeeping

4845.44 --> 4849.159
see see the difference

4868.4 --> 4873.28
that's just called focus

4871.36 --> 4874.799999999999
stick to the subject it's difficult

4873.28 --> 4878.0
enough

4874.8 --> 4879.6
no need to drag everything else in there

4878.0 --> 4881.44
too right

4879.6 --> 4882.8
it's kind of like a professional focused

4881.44 --> 4885.839999999999
thing

4882.8 --> 4887.28
they don't actively shame

4885.84 --> 4888.88
the thing that they don't want to

4887.28 --> 4892.759999999999
discuss

4888.88 --> 4892.76
then they're not really gatekeepers

4912.239 --> 4918.5599999999995
oh jesus gadget inspector

4915.52 --> 4923.120000000001
that's not healthy

4918.56 --> 4923.120000000001
staying up till 6am jesus

4927.44 --> 4932.4
dude if you're noticing that you get

4929.6 --> 4935.52
into zombie mode staring at a

4932.4 --> 4937.92
tv computer or mobile screen

4935.52 --> 4939.84
and you feel like i should be going to

4937.92 --> 4941.92
sleep i should be going to sleep but i

4939.84 --> 4945.1990000000005
can't stop staring at it

4941.92 --> 4947.679
you should just literally snap out of it

4945.199 --> 4950.0
turn it off bang off

4947.679 --> 4950.0
poof

4950.4 --> 4954.32
because you can really get stuck in a

4952.4 --> 4955.92
trance like that i've been through that

4954.32 --> 4957.92
like with my computer i have that

4955.92 --> 4960.32
sometimes it's annoying because then

4957.92 --> 4962.2390000000005
yeah you go to bed way too late and it's

4960.32 --> 4965.44
not necessarily gratifying it's just

4962.239 --> 4967.599999999999
like you're spellbound to it

4965.44 --> 4969.199
and the best thing is to just really

4967.6 --> 4972.96
just turn it

4969.199 --> 4974.5599999999995
hard turn off bang just like i can stare

4972.96 --> 4976.719
more at this or i could

4974.56 --> 4979.120000000001
turn it off bang

4976.719 --> 4982.159
snap out of it

4979.12 --> 4984.639
because staying up to six am is not

4982.159 --> 4984.638999999999
healthy

4985.36 --> 4988.5599999999995
just a piece of advice

4990.0 --> 4992.88
a little cleary

4993.679 --> 5000.04
better neat than lever

4996.719 --> 5000.04
hello manu

5008.4 --> 5013.799999999999
the stars may run out soon run out of

5010.8 --> 5013.8
what

5024.719 --> 5027.719
uh

5031.28 --> 5037.44
what's on my laptop and it wasn't fe it

5033.52 --> 5037.4400000000005
was watching world war ii videos

5038.4 --> 5042.879999999999
still the same

5040.719 --> 5045.84
unless it was something you really

5042.88 --> 5047.4400000000005
needed to assimilate if there was a real

5045.84 --> 5049.1990000000005
internal point

5047.44 --> 5051.04
if you were really digging for something

5049.199 --> 5052.5599999999995
then i get it

5051.04 --> 5054.4
if you're just

5052.56 --> 5056.400000000001
watching one video after i'm just

5054.4 --> 5059.36
staring

5056.4 --> 5063.12
that's not good it's not

5059.36 --> 5063.12
it's better to just go to sleep then

5068.48 --> 5073.199
i've had plenty of that yes i have

5070.88 --> 5075.76
actually just like stared at world war

5073.199 --> 5078.0
ii videos for a very long time too like

5075.76 --> 5079.04
that in late at night

5078.0 --> 5081.36
mostly

5079.04 --> 5085.84
the first period of the awakening the

5081.36 --> 5085.839999999999
alex jones period i like to call it

5086.239 --> 5092.239
when i was still watching like history

5088.239 --> 5092.239
channel and [ __ ] so i saw a lot of that

5094.239 --> 5098.759999999999
now it's all become different

5100.56 --> 5104.4800000000005
is there live fed today

5105.199 --> 5107.678999999999
let's see

5110.32 --> 5114.96
i don't know

5111.6 --> 5114.96
i'm not seeing uh

5117.199 --> 5120.638999999999
i'm not seeing a link yet

5124.639 --> 5129.1990000000005
we'll see but it's still early so anyway

5127.6 --> 5132.360000000001
i'm gonna have a two-minute break be

5129.199 --> 5132.36
right back

5264.08 --> 5267.08
uh

5280.56 --> 5284.719
the media is the enemy of the people

5285.84 --> 5292.04
well which media

5288.8 --> 5292.04
and how

5316.4 --> 5319.4
hmm

5336.719 --> 5339.719
ugh

5352.48 --> 5359.5199999999995
dog was a guilty pleasure what are you

5355.44 --> 5359.5199999999995
talking about i don't know what dog

5361.28 --> 5365.84
dog the bounty hunter that's some

5363.12 --> 5365.84
channel

5368.4 --> 5372.759999999999
is that a show like what

5387.199 --> 5392.799999999999
the gappy petito and i'm

5390.719 --> 5394.96
flooding the internet was not flooding

5392.8 --> 5399.320000000001
over here

5394.96 --> 5399.32
so there might just be a local flood

5424.4 --> 5430.159
god

5426.239 --> 5433.28
oh quickly let me google it i need to

5430.159 --> 5436.0
keep up with the trends

5433.28 --> 5439.12
because everybody says

5436.0 --> 5442.6
it's flooding the internet now i have to

5439.12 --> 5442.599999999999
google it

5457.44 --> 5460.44
okay

5480.88 --> 5484.159000000001
murder investigation

5484.4 --> 5486.879999999999
what the

5488.96 --> 5494.4800000000005
oh [ __ ]

5491.52 --> 5497.4400000000005
okay somebody went on

5494.48 --> 5497.44
a trip and then

5500.4 --> 5503.44
do they know who did it was it like

5502.4 --> 5505.839999999999
something

5503.44 --> 5507.678999999999
that did was did that happen on camera

5505.84 --> 5510.159000000001
or is it like a mystery and she just

5507.679 --> 5511.84
disappeared

5510.159 --> 5514.239
there's so much here i don't know what

5511.84 --> 5514.2390000000005
to click

5515.52 --> 5520.96
say homicide disappearance

5518.48 --> 5524.5599999999995
right so that

5520.96 --> 5524.56
didn't happen on camera at least

5527.36 --> 5530.36
okay

5556.4 --> 5559.4
well

5560.0 --> 5563.12
that's weird that you say that because

5561.84 --> 5566.88
i've

5563.12 --> 5569.76
i bumped into something similar

5566.88 --> 5569.76
on rt

5573.36 --> 5578.48
where some guy also like murdered his

5575.84 --> 5578.4800000000005
girlfriend

5578.88 --> 5582.400000000001
where was that

5580.159 --> 5585.5199999999995
so

5582.4 --> 5586.5599999999995
i guess that what that's what happens

5585.52 --> 5589.679
in

5586.56 --> 5593.360000000001
the breakup period enters and then some

5589.679 --> 5593.36
people go ape [ __ ]

5598.0 --> 5603.679
i mean i hate to say it but i think it's

5599.84 --> 5607.4800000000005
the season for it

5603.679 --> 5607.4800000000005
it's not my season

5636.239 --> 5640.799999999999
serial killer

5638.4 --> 5640.799999999999
all right

5641.199 --> 5647.08
it's

5642.08 --> 5647.08
just a little uh

5659.12 --> 5664.0
ultimately they will restrict contract

5662.32 --> 5666.799999999999
how

5664.0 --> 5666.8
how does that work

5670.56 --> 5676.080000000001
i was getting super chats to abuse her

5673.44 --> 5678.4
well then it is definitely a censorship

5676.08 --> 5680.719
stunt

5678.4 --> 5684.879999999999
but it's only logical because the

5680.719 --> 5687.04
communist government want full control

5684.88 --> 5689.1990000000005
the they want

5687.04 --> 5692.56
social media to be under

5689.199 --> 5694.239
direct political control

5692.56 --> 5696.080000000001
right turning everything into

5694.239 --> 5697.5199999999995
bureaucracy

5696.08 --> 5701.119
it's the communist way so yeah i

5697.52 --> 5704.0
wouldn't be surprised if it was a hoax

5701.119 --> 5705.759999999999
or a stunt

5704.0 --> 5708.32
maybe even partially

5705.76 --> 5710.08
crisis act involved i don't know i i

5708.32 --> 5712.4
haven't seen any

5710.08 --> 5714.159
actual data about it yet only what you

5712.4 --> 5715.92
guys are saying and that apparently it

5714.159 --> 5717.199
is a subject i've seen some headlines

5715.92 --> 5720.2390000000005
that's it

5717.199 --> 5720.239
i don't know what it is

5721.28 --> 5724.8
but dude there's like people just

5723.119 --> 5727.5199999999995
getting off

5724.8 --> 5728.400000000001
like on [ __ ] camera

5727.52 --> 5730.96
like

5728.4 --> 5730.96
hundreds

5732.08 --> 5737.92
like oh we're going to go after oh

5734.8 --> 5742.4800000000005
no no nobody goes after them

5737.92 --> 5745.52
they're serial killers in plain sight

5742.48 --> 5748.718999999999
serial killers in plain sight and nobody

5745.52 --> 5748.719
does [ __ ] about that

5749.52 --> 5751.84
right

5752.48 --> 5757.839999999999
you know who i'm talking about

5756.88 --> 5760.84
certain

5757.84 --> 5760.84
demographic

5772.8 --> 5776.400000000001
live streaming will be

5774.4 --> 5780.159
licensed entities only well if that's

5776.4 --> 5782.08
gonna happen there will be an explosive

5780.159 --> 5785.119
pirate

5782.08 --> 5788.639
social media streaming scene coming out

5785.119 --> 5790.239
of that guaranteed cleary you can't stop

5788.639 --> 5791.36
the signal

5790.239 --> 5792.638999999999
like

5791.36 --> 5795.44
that's not

5792.639 --> 5797.6
a trendy resistance saying that's

5795.44 --> 5801.36
actually an established fact you can't

5797.6 --> 5803.1990000000005
stop the signal you can't stop people

5801.36 --> 5806.32
from streaming

5803.199 --> 5808.799999999999
they will do their own streaming

5806.32 --> 5810.48
and they will protect their streaming

5808.8 --> 5812.159000000001
capabilities and they will encrypt it

5810.48 --> 5814.4
and it will do it secret so there will

5812.159 --> 5816.32
be streaming there will be videos and

5814.4 --> 5818.638999999999
there will be nothing that anybody can

5816.32 --> 5820.239
stop to stop that

5818.639 --> 5823.119
like they literally would have to send

5820.239 --> 5825.36
the swat team after their location to

5823.119 --> 5827.599999999999
stop them as soon as they find out where

5825.36 --> 5828.5599999999995
it is actually happening

5827.6 --> 5830.320000000001
right

5828.56 --> 5832.639
because you can't stop the signal not

5830.32 --> 5835.119
really they can take control of the

5832.639 --> 5838.0
convenient platforms we've gotten used

5835.119 --> 5841.28
to they partially already have but you

5838.0 --> 5845.04
can't actually stop people

5841.28 --> 5847.84
from streaming a license to stream

5845.04 --> 5850.32
that's literally like a license for free

5847.84 --> 5852.0
speech guys that's a license for free

5850.32 --> 5854.48
speech

5852.0 --> 5856.159
there's no way

5854.48 --> 5858.959999999999
like

5856.159 --> 5861.119
even if people would be stupid enough to

5858.96 --> 5864.0
let that happen

5861.119 --> 5866.88
it won't be effective

5864.0 --> 5869.04
people will pirate stream

5866.88 --> 5870.96
they will break out

5869.04 --> 5873.28
and

5870.96 --> 5875.92
as a result the opposition will only

5873.28 --> 5877.92
lose more control

5875.92 --> 5880.56
because the people that do that will

5877.92 --> 5883.84
have more freedom more will because they

5880.56 --> 5883.84
go there and then they can

5885.28 --> 5890.0
and now it's no longer in the technocrat

5888.48 --> 5892.48
playground

5890.0 --> 5895.679
they still had some nudging influences

5892.48 --> 5897.678999999999
they could do to subtly stare things

5895.679 --> 5900.639
right or if they then just say oh you

5897.679 --> 5903.1990000000005
have to have a streaming license

5900.639 --> 5906.56
guess what's going to happen that subtle

5903.199 --> 5909.119
nudging quality that they had

5906.56 --> 5912.080000000001
and people would voluntarily submit to

5909.119 --> 5914.719
that they lose that

5912.08 --> 5916.32
they lose it

5914.719 --> 5917.92
loser

5916.32 --> 5919.44
you will lose

5917.92 --> 5921.6
technocrats

5919.44 --> 5924.08
you can't stop the signal

5921.6 --> 5928.88
you can't

5924.08 --> 5928.88
make licenses for free speech

5931.6 --> 5937.84
violates constitution no

5934.639 --> 5940.32
constitution number one

5937.84 --> 5940.32
what do you say

5941.199 --> 5945.36
the number one on the list the first

5942.88 --> 5945.36
amendment

5948.639 --> 5952.36
it's just no

5959.28 --> 5962.28
what

5967.28 --> 5972.159
right and besides oh the technocrats

5970.8 --> 5974.159000000001
have all these

5972.159 --> 5976.32
systems to

5974.159 --> 5977.759999999999
to get control over you through your

5976.32 --> 5980.4
mobile and this and that and the

5977.76 --> 5983.04
technology well guess what there's some

5980.4 --> 5985.199
pretty damn good hackers out there

5983.04 --> 5987.36
been very aware of all of this for a

5985.199 --> 5990.0
long time

5987.36 --> 5993.36
you can literally convert devices and

5990.0 --> 5995.84
completely and permanently

5993.36 --> 5998.5599999999995
route out any technocratic control with

5995.84 --> 6000.56
them but they would become new devices

5998.56 --> 6001.92
that's actually much easier than you

6000.56 --> 6003.76
would imagine

6001.92 --> 6005.4400000000005
if you're good at doing that

6003.76 --> 6007.76
specifically and there are people out

6005.44 --> 6009.599999999999
there that are

6007.76 --> 6013.84
and they do it

6009.6 --> 6017.4400000000005
for freedom of expression for freedom

6013.84 --> 6020.8
right i remember how the xbox

6017.44 --> 6024.719
just a standard game console right not

6020.8 --> 6025.679
super impressive it was okay at the time

6024.719 --> 6028.4800000000005
how

6025.679 --> 6031.28
the hackers basically figured out how to

6028.48 --> 6034.08
convert it how to convert it into a

6031.28 --> 6036.5599999999995
brilliant media system

6034.08 --> 6039.119
you can still have that done to an old

6036.56 --> 6041.360000000001
ad xbox and use it as a media system

6039.119 --> 6044.239
where you can watch youtube videos

6041.36 --> 6046.159
television stations

6044.239 --> 6048.879999999999
all kinds of things you can do with it

6046.159 --> 6052.48
it's very basic and it's free there's no

6048.88 --> 6054.56
grip it's free

6052.48 --> 6056.0
and there's nothing they can do to take

6054.56 --> 6058.56
that away right

6056.0 --> 6062.32
and that was

6058.56 --> 6062.320000000001
10 years ago and more

6062.56 --> 6066.400000000001
you think that the people that figured

6064.32 --> 6068.08
that out that they're going to stop

6066.4 --> 6070.159
applying

6068.08 --> 6073.679
that kind of action to the newer

6070.159 --> 6076.96
technologies i don't think so

6073.679 --> 6080.88
they can't muzzle your free speech they

6076.96 --> 6083.119
can't really do it they go too far

6080.88 --> 6085.36
their systems will simply be

6083.119 --> 6088.36
assimilated and purged from their

6085.36 --> 6088.36
control

6093.04 --> 6097.6
there is fed today ah

6096.4 --> 6101.4
where

6097.6 --> 6101.400000000001
i don't see any link

6120.239 --> 6123.239
uh

6134.96 --> 6139.84
146 oh it's a premiere

6137.6 --> 6139.84
then

6140.239 --> 6145.5199999999995
because episode 1500 passed

6143.6 --> 6147.04
remember

6145.52 --> 6149.1990000000005
that was friday

6147.04 --> 6150.96
i think was thursday

6149.199 --> 6154.74
so yeah then it's just premiere so

6150.96 --> 6157.88
there's no live show today

6154.74 --> 6157.88
[Applause]

6182.88 --> 6187.92
no that's not true about in 500 only

6185.92 --> 6190.08
second amendment matters

6187.92 --> 6191.679
if you relinqui if you give up your

6190.08 --> 6193.6
first amendment

6191.679 --> 6196.0
then the second amendment is useless

6193.6 --> 6196.0
because

6197.84 --> 6203.52
that prevents you from

6200.88 --> 6206.32
informing yourself

6203.52 --> 6208.719
and from connecting

6206.32 --> 6211.28
first like the second amendment is there

6208.719 --> 6214.08
to actually reinforce the first

6211.28 --> 6215.599999999999
amendment first and foremost

6214.08 --> 6218.32
because without the first amendment

6215.6 --> 6220.320000000001
there's nothing

6218.32 --> 6222.239
literally nothing that's why it's the

6220.32 --> 6224.159
first amendment

6222.239 --> 6226.48
because it is the most critical one the

6224.159 --> 6228.5599999999995
freedom of speech is

6226.48 --> 6230.48
critical

6228.56 --> 6232.400000000001
because it can

6230.48 --> 6235.28
without it things can

6232.4 --> 6237.36
dive so deep into hell

6235.28 --> 6239.199
so deep

6237.36 --> 6243.199
so never underestimate the first

6239.199 --> 6243.199
amendment how important that one is

6244.88 --> 6247.84
like no freedom of speech means no

6246.88 --> 6249.679
freedom

6247.84 --> 6251.92
at all

6249.679 --> 6253.36
once that goes then all the other

6251.92 --> 6256.4
freedom goes

6253.36 --> 6256.4
soon after that

6258.8 --> 6261.52
without the second yeah that's right

6260.4 --> 6264.879999999999
that's

6261.52 --> 6264.88
it's that yeah but it is

6266.159 --> 6269.5199999999995
it's there to

6267.92 --> 6275.159
guarantee the first

6269.52 --> 6275.159000000001
so yes you d the second is very helpful

6275.76 --> 6278.76
definitely

6298.719 --> 6303.32
what are you blabbering about jason

6300.32 --> 6303.32
mccormack

6318.4 --> 6324.96
okay natural wallace that sounds very

6322.239 --> 6324.959999999999
ethereal

6328.4 --> 6335.759999999999
this or dissolve the artifact what

6332.4 --> 6335.759999999999
are you sending me on a quest

6338.88 --> 6341.88

okay jason if you say so i don't know i

6372.159 --> 6376.5599999999995
don't know the situation i don't even

6373.84 --> 6376.56
know where you live

6377.76 --> 6383.08
but that's fine don't necessarily need

6380.08 --> 6383.08
to

6394.08 --> 6399.0
ohio

6396.0 --> 6399.0
right

6411.44 --> 6418.44
you dank long time no see

6414.639 --> 6418.4400000000005
c bus what

6451.44 --> 6457.839999999999
yeah los angeles it's always it's been

6454.239 --> 6457.839999999999
crazy there for a long time

6472.239 --> 6478.599999999999
columbus is known as sebas

6475.6 --> 6478.6
okay

6489.84 --> 6495.56
like dude just say columbus what's the

6492.56 --> 6495.56
problem

6501.6 --> 6505.159000000001
hamster balls

6528.96 --> 6533.04
all right i think i'm gonna round out

6531.04 --> 6534.88
the show

6533.04 --> 6537.44
uh

6534.88 --> 6539.679
it's getting a little bit

6537.44 --> 6541.678999999999
watered down now

6539.679 --> 6543.84
and i'm getting hungry been streaming

6541.679 --> 6547.52
for

6543.84 --> 6547.52
hour 47 minutes

6548.719 --> 6553.4
yeah it really does seem like there's no

6550.4 --> 6553.4
show

6554.32 --> 6556.719
nathan

6561.199 --> 6564.799999999999
annoying

6562.8 --> 6566.96
anyway

6564.8 --> 6568.8
thanks everyone for coming

6566.96 --> 6570.56
i hope you like this show i thought it

6568.8 --> 6573.360000000001
was pretty good

6570.56 --> 6575.76
a bit over the place but still

6573.36 --> 6578.239
interesting i made a couple of very good

6575.76 --> 6580.4800000000005
points again i'm gonna have to watch

6578.239 --> 6582.4
back to even remember what they were but

6580.48 --> 6585.04
i know they were good

6582.4 --> 6587.36
i remember that this is weird isn't it i

6585.04 --> 6589.5199999999995
remember like oh yeah

6587.36 --> 6591.199
i had this level of good point and then

6589.52 --> 6592.400000000001
that level of good boy i said this

6591.199 --> 6596.48
really well

6592.4 --> 6600.32
i just don't remember what it was

6596.48 --> 6600.32
but that's because i was saying it

6600.719 --> 6605.44
i always have to watch back my own show

6602.719 --> 6607.44
to even remember like

6605.44 --> 6608.719
what it actually was that i was saying a

6607.44 --> 6611.28
lot of the time

6608.719 --> 6612.8
it's weird how that works

6611.28 --> 6614.5599999999995
but i know i made it oh yeah now i

6612.8 --> 6616.320000000001
remember it was about the shields and

6614.56 --> 6619.92
the gatekeepers yeah that was an

6616.32 --> 6622.08
important part to explain

6619.92 --> 6625.599
it's very serious it's it's something

6622.08 --> 6628.5599999999995
you need to consider because it is a

6625.599 --> 6630.2390000000005
bad habit a thing out there among flat

6628.56 --> 6632.639
earthers too that they just constantly

6630.239 --> 6635.28
call everybody chill and gatekeeper if

6632.639 --> 6637.679
they don't like him

6635.28 --> 6639.119
and that's incorrect

6637.679 --> 6641.1990000000005
because

6639.119 --> 6643.92
they were have very specific workings

6641.199 --> 6645.36
and i basically explained how to

6643.92 --> 6647.36
distinguish

6645.36 --> 6649.36
a gatekeeper from just somebody that

6647.36 --> 6651.598999999999
doesn't want to address

6649.36 --> 6653.598999999999
a certain subject

6651.599 --> 6656.2390000000005
in what they do

6653.599 --> 6659.28
and that's different anyway

6656.239 --> 6661.44
was a good show i think if you liked it

6659.28 --> 6664.159
as well then please don't forget to
