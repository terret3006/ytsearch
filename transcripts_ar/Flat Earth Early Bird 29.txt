1.37 --> 12.5
Oh morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.929 --> 18.619
early-bird number 29 I'm your host

12.5 --> 28.939
Arwen yeah again another rainy day out

18.619 --> 33.289
there but no that's not that bad yeah

28.939 --> 37.22
was a hangout apparently between Nathan

33.289 --> 39.370000000000005
and ranty some three hours ago was

37.22 --> 43.25
pretty interesting watching part of that

39.37 --> 49.28
just know it's very similar to when I

43.25 --> 51.26
talk about the debates and yeah totally

49.28 --> 55.629000000000005
spot-on with their analysis in my

51.26 --> 59.21
opinions and it was good to hear some

55.629 --> 66.74
some meta talk from their side as well

59.21 --> 77.389
so yeah like that what else is happening

66.74 --> 80.149
in the world a lot but when myself is

77.389 --> 87.139
concerned it is mostly just sitting

80.149 --> 90.529
through all of this because technically

87.139 --> 93.619
there is so much I want to do so though

90.529 --> 97.189
I can do at the time because of

93.619 --> 101.119
financial issues and all things are all

97.189 --> 103.03899999999999
building up until that point like

101.119 --> 105.709
including the show including the

103.039 --> 107.419
thousand subscribers yeah it's probably

105.709 --> 112.669
gonna get there I'm probably gonna get

107.419 --> 116.289
there some point but yeah until then I'm

112.669 --> 116.289
just gonna have to do what I do and

116.409 --> 125.2
stick with that not get into trouble

119.869 --> 129.679
financially and that's going okay and

125.2 --> 134.08
yeah eventually that that limit will be

129.679 --> 138.43
hit and I will be able to finally do

134.08 --> 142.96
do a lot more than I'm now well is what

138.43 --> 144.76000000000002
it is but still and very much stuck to

142.96 --> 147.61
spending a lot of time on hobbies and

144.76 --> 150.87
such things that I can just do here and

147.61 --> 153.97000000000003
that don't cost a lot of money and that

150.87 --> 157.65
are satisfying enough to spend a lot of

153.97 --> 159.49
time on not getting really bored or

157.65 --> 164.04
getting the feeling that you're

159.49 --> 167.26000000000002
repeating yourself doing useless [ __ ]

164.04 --> 170.41
because that is also burden someone like

167.26 --> 174.25
me we have to find something purposeful

170.41 --> 178.06
to do and well of course a early bird

174.25 --> 182.43
it's a new thing while you 29 episodes

178.06 --> 184.66
and yeah it is fulfilling as well

182.43 --> 187.98000000000002
because for me every time it is a

184.66 --> 191.62
challenge okay how can I keep on talking

187.98 --> 195.13
but at the same time don't overdo it

191.62 --> 196.63
don't just talk because you have to talk

195.13 --> 200.53
and it becomes stupid

196.63 --> 205.09
so preferably about good subjects

200.53 --> 209.37
let's see you as in chat okay poor Pete

205.09 --> 209.37
Mars said an alien

218.23 --> 223.069
yeah can you expand on that and I'm not

221.0 --> 225.439
sure if I've seen you yeah I've only

223.069 --> 228.70899999999997
seen like half an hour and seven Elian

225.439 --> 234.819
says it's nice to hear what happened to

228.709 --> 238.329
Randy so could you elaborate on that

234.819 --> 238.32899999999998
sell a million

254.24 --> 267.53000000000003
you mean intimidated intimated word yeah

262.22 --> 271.61
okay but look o us flat-earthers have

267.53 --> 276.04999999999995
been intimidated by trolls one point or

271.61 --> 281.06
another and the thing is as we progress

276.05 --> 283.97
as we persist we learn to overcome these

281.06 --> 285.32
obstacles and so we are no longer

283.97 --> 287.81
intimidated by them

285.32 --> 290.48
at the same time the ballers make very

287.81 --> 295.22
little progression there seem to be

290.48 --> 297.86
progressing is the the level of

295.22 --> 300.05
psychological warfare basically that

297.86 --> 302.69
seems to be their learning points

300.05 --> 306.35
they're getting more aggravating but

302.69 --> 309.86
intimidating no no the intimidation is

306.35 --> 311.72
pretty much gone by now you know a year

309.86 --> 315.08000000000004
ago maybe some points

311.72 --> 317.39000000000004
people like rumpus to me would sound

315.08 --> 321.14
intimidating because of their apparent

317.39 --> 323.87
detailed knowledge in things and mastery

321.14 --> 325.78999999999996
in math but at the same time even then

323.87 --> 328.07
it was obvious like yeah these people

325.79 --> 330.71000000000004
are stuck in a system they're not very

328.07 --> 334.07
flexible despite them mastering their

330.71 --> 336.46
systems and now we just figure out that

334.07 --> 339.32
they don't even master their system

336.46 --> 341.96
because we've mastered it and I myself

339.32 --> 344.44
yeah there's just these glaring holes in

341.96 --> 349.31
in their systems and they just

344.44 --> 353.27
disconnect look over it or just outright

349.31 --> 356.75
deny it like no that's not true can't

353.27 --> 359.27
explain why it's not true they can

356.75 --> 363.83
repeat again how it is supposed to be

359.27 --> 365.39
but they can actually explain why it is

363.83 --> 368.41999999999996
supposed to work the way it's supposed

365.39 --> 371.18
to work involving the other physics and

368.42 --> 373.82
everything they never do that always

371.18 --> 378.61
leave out what gets in the way that's

373.82 --> 378.61
their tactic so

383.57 --> 388.27
right

385.53 --> 390.42999999999995
okay so Llanelli and i will probably

388.27 --> 395.10999999999996
talk about it with randy in the debates

390.43 --> 421.3
or maybe here that would be nice think

395.11 --> 423.51
so but yeah anyway hmm hello in those

421.3 --> 423.51
days

427.03 --> 438.71
so we have just little like one of my

436.159 --> 443.0
roommates one guy that I really really

438.71 --> 448.31
liked so he moved he's moving out he

443.0 --> 449.93
actually bought a pretty good house at

448.31 --> 451.729
least yeah he bought a house together

449.93 --> 455.90000000000003
with girlfriend and yeah it's so

451.729 --> 459.62
exciting and stuff and yeah I'm sad to

455.9 --> 462.289
see him go but he just like he just

459.62 --> 465.53000000000003
threw away a lot of [ __ ] and actually

462.289 --> 467.18
did away with his magic cards and just

465.53 --> 469.48999999999995
said like yeah you know what I'm not

467.18 --> 470.87
taking the effort to even go out into

469.49 --> 476.38
the city and try to sell them or

470.87 --> 476.38
anything so here what's really nice is

476.53 --> 485.38899999999995
stack of magic cards although yeah I

481.94 --> 487.58
mean not gonna be be able to integrate

485.389 --> 490.31
them in my decks because these are all

487.58 --> 494.62
the new Pokemon style cards which I

490.31 --> 497.81
despise and the rules have become so

494.62 --> 500.0
different that I just don't even know

497.81 --> 502.069
how to use these cards anymore although

500.0 --> 505.88
they have the descriptions of course but

502.069 --> 508.639
it's become so complex no idea how this

505.88 --> 512.11
works but I looked them up and yet some

508.639 --> 519.8290000000001
of it is worth something so I was just

512.11 --> 522.399
nice to get a fortune that'll get me

519.829 --> 522.399
through this time

522.789 --> 533.27
so yeah lucky me and I really appreciate

526.279 --> 535.55
it my friend even offered him like yeah

533.27 --> 538.459
you know what I'll if you want to give

535.55 --> 541.25
you like half what I get from it because

538.459 --> 544.27
I'm not gonna keep it anyway but he just

541.25 --> 547.81
said no you just take it all right

544.27 --> 547.81
he's a really nice guy

551.68 --> 558.62
still moving somewhere in Utrecht so is

555.05 --> 560.42
nothing you can come to be that far but

558.62 --> 564.64
it was good to have another roommate but

560.42 --> 567.5889999999999
to bump into him talk I miss him

564.64 --> 569.17
alright no P Mars I'm not sending you

567.589 --> 573.98
the link

569.17 --> 579.62
hey Ali be welcome to Flat Earth early

573.98 --> 597.47
bird yeah

579.62 --> 600.829
le VI no P Marxist baller I got a taste

597.47 --> 603.86
for poker every now and then with a face

600.829 --> 607.459
but then yeah it dies down again we lose

603.86 --> 609.2
interest and then after a while I don't

607.459 --> 612.8199999999999
know how long I've never even paid

609.2 --> 616.1
attention me for the years 50 months

612.82 --> 618.1700000000001
just spark my interest sparks again and

616.1 --> 620.0
I'll try it out again but I'm yeah I'm

618.17 --> 624.17
not doing it for money for real money

620.0 --> 627.29
it's not you know if you don't have any

624.17 --> 630.68
money to risk that that you could afford

627.29 --> 634.06
to lose you shouldn't do that [ __ ] and I

630.68 --> 634.06
don't have it by far

641.38 --> 649.95
no but usually in games when there's no

645.91 --> 649.9499999999999
money x6 I'm extremely lucky

653.19 --> 660.4000000000001
but yeah the weight of money just

655.6 --> 664.5400000000001
changes the entire energy so I can't do

660.4 --> 668.22
that and have the same fun and the luck

664.54 --> 668.2199999999999
that Springs from the fun I'm having

672.96 --> 685.1500000000001
so now I'll just stick to ya card games

680.17 --> 688.36
for fun like I play hearthstone still

685.15 --> 691.78
although yeah I have to be careful with

688.36 --> 696.67
that game because there are some 8i

691.78 --> 699.1899999999999
players in there just the game can be

696.67 --> 701.56
extremely aggravating at times because

699.19 --> 707.8800000000001
there's a big luck element random

701.56 --> 711.39
element to it has become that and yeah

707.88 --> 713.95
it's very obvious sometimes like okay

711.39 --> 717.55
from all the log factors like every time

713.95 --> 719.71
you get to pick a random card you can

717.55 --> 721.66
choose like out of three then either you

719.71 --> 724.39
get extremely lucky and gets like the

721.66 --> 726.31
best options ever or it's total [ __ ] and

724.39 --> 727.51
then keeps on staying ship for the

726.31 --> 729.88
entire game every time you do something

727.51 --> 733.42
like that it's just aggravating it's so

729.88 --> 735.13
it feels unfair and that aggravates me

733.42 --> 738.25
to no end so I have to be careful with

735.13 --> 750.9399999999999
head game start doing that just step

738.25 --> 755.07
away and start yelling at it so I played

750.94 --> 761.0200000000001
that and baldur's gate times and

755.07 --> 763.36
civilization 5 it's just not always but

761.02 --> 768.9399999999999
yeah and I played that game a lot as

763.36 --> 772.86
well know every freaking detail it's

768.94 --> 776.9200000000001
just to me it's more like a puzzle

772.86 --> 779.17
because I really know how I can predict

776.92 --> 786.28
it so well no it's not that

779.17 --> 788.68
unpredictable and yeah it's just fun to

786.28 --> 791.98
do fun way to spend the time in the

788.68 --> 795.4899999999999
music's kind of good depending on what

791.98 --> 801.6
civilization you're playing I happen to

795.49 --> 805.36
like Russia a lot it's good music and a

801.6 --> 808.45
useful side abilities anyway stupid game

805.36 --> 821.08
talks I play games but yeah not as much

808.45 --> 823.57
as I used to anything they'd agreed see

821.08 --> 827.5
you guys peanuts Clark what's good to

823.57 --> 830.2800000000001
have you on yesterday if any of you guys

827.5 --> 830.28

850.67 --> 856.1899999999999
right okay I'm somebody on skype has

854.06 --> 859.5699999999999
contacted me called Alan back

856.19 --> 859.57
that's not Ellen be right

905.59 --> 910.37
yeah I added you so yeah if you want to

908.51 --> 912.86
talk sometime or get on the show that's

910.37 --> 918.98
good that's fine if you want to join

912.86 --> 925.91
just tell me Oh what the heck I'll just

918.98 --> 930.07
give you the link right there it's just

925.91 --> 930.0699999999999
gonna be Tommy talking about games again

932.92 --> 948.11
although I could talk about media

937.46 --> 953.1800000000001
narratives but it's either really

948.11 --> 957.49
obvious to everyone or you're just gonna

953.18 --> 960.68
hate it outright so much and reject it I

957.49 --> 962.5600000000001
keep on interested I'm basically trying

960.68 --> 966.92
to see what they're trying to achieve

962.56 --> 968.66
each media narrative how they're

966.92 --> 971.11
accomplishing it what their target

968.66 --> 974.48
audience is how that will affect

971.11 --> 976.49
everyone also the NAM target audience

974.48 --> 984.11
and you see what's happening

976.49 --> 988.88
like as a pattern and I just look at

984.11 --> 991.34
that basically as the new narrow as the

988.88 --> 993.26
narrative continues I just try to see

991.34 --> 995.3000000000001
okay what is this what is this a

993.26 --> 1001.96
response to what simultaneously going on

995.3 --> 1003.3399999999999
is this a good dynamic direction or are

1001.96 --> 1005.5600000000001
they trying to build up to something

1003.34 --> 1010.87
specifically I don't know I just I

1005.56 --> 1013.15
really overanalyze all the media I'm not

1010.87 --> 1015.22
all the media just certain channels and

1013.15 --> 1017.7099999999999
they will have a lot of opposing

1015.22 --> 1019.5400000000001
channels snippets of that as well so I

1017.71 --> 1022.39
don't actually have to literally watch

1019.54 --> 1026.589
that which would be unbearable like I'm

1022.39 --> 1028.99
not gonna and watch to see that that

1026.589 --> 1033.81
have just that makes me nauseated just

1028.99 --> 1033.81
even thinking about it yeah

1033.829 --> 1035.86
Oh

1046.339 --> 1051.76
but yeah things aren't keeping on going

1049.13 --> 1051.7600000000002
in

1057.64 --> 1066.0600000000002
it's at least obvious that despite

1060.99 --> 1068.59
public awareness criticism flat-earthers

1066.06 --> 1070.6
everywhere and let earth trolls and

1068.59 --> 1073.6
commenters everywhere like literally

1070.6 --> 1076.6599999999999
even them on RT like in our tea I am

1073.6 --> 1078.1599999999999
banned I have been for a while to my set

1076.66 --> 1080.92
aside Inc there's a bunch of social

1078.16 --> 1083.68
justice warriors or something behind the

1080.92 --> 1086.8600000000001
moderator seat they're just like with

1083.68 --> 1088.72
with discus on the Infowars before but

1086.86 --> 1092.53
they changed so now I can do comment

1088.72 --> 1094.63
again it's a another system but yet this

1092.53 --> 1096.27
still despite me not being with a

1094.63 --> 1098.8000000000002
comment there and there's a lot of space

1096.27 --> 1100.99
articles and stuff there are just

1098.8 --> 1103.12
straight-out brutal Flat Earth

1100.99 --> 1105.58
commenters there a lot of them and they

1103.12 --> 1111.27
get a lot of votes so it's like whoa

1105.58 --> 1114.9099999999999
okay that is allowed to sit there that's

1111.27 --> 1119.02
that's pretty hefty like they could

1114.91 --> 1121.0900000000001
definitely just very easily sense or all

1119.02 --> 1125.01
of it entirely but they're not doing

1121.09 --> 1129.76
that so what's what's happening is this

1125.01 --> 1133.6
are they agreeing with my dual Cosmo

1129.76 --> 1138.79
Cheney concept that I talked about over

1133.6 --> 1141.2099999999998
a year though that just be flat earth

1138.79 --> 1145.06
awakening is going to be allowed to be

1141.21 --> 1148.48
naturally present while space belief is

1145.06 --> 1150.4299999999998
also going to be continued because yet

1148.48 --> 1154.59
they're still very active with the

1150.43 --> 1160.24
rocket departments and they're in

1154.59 --> 1164.85
proving the the show-quality basically

1160.24 --> 1168.85
of what NASA and SpaceX is doing there

1164.85 --> 1170.9499999999998
it's only gradual like even even now we

1168.85 --> 1174.04
could see you and say okay we could do

1170.95 --> 1176.02
better but they're still improving a

1174.04 --> 1180.37
little and there's just a lot more of it

1176.02 --> 1181.78
so they're definitely not giving up it's

1180.37 --> 1186.4899999999998
no sign that they're giving up they're

1181.78 --> 1190.21
actually trying to yeah put more out and

1186.49 --> 1192.22
and reinforce the belief so

1190.21 --> 1193.81
but at the same time they're letting

1192.22 --> 1197.05
flat earth be flatter than they're

1193.81 --> 1199.1799999999998
letting Flat Earth comments be seen by

1197.05 --> 1203.04
people so they're not erasing it they're

1199.18 --> 1205.8700000000001
really counting on the belief and the

1203.04 --> 1208.54
programming to reinforce itself and to

1205.87 --> 1212.32
protect against this this just open

1208.54 --> 1214.53
truth and it's probably working to some

1212.32 --> 1219.79
degree the thing is they're just

1214.53 --> 1223.6
allowing that and that's a good thing

1219.79 --> 1230.2
and a careful thing and it yeah again

1223.6 --> 1232.9299999999998
makes me give me the the impulse like to

1230.2 --> 1235.78
put up we have to be responsible because

1232.93 --> 1238.98
that could change like flat earthers go

1235.78 --> 1243.6399999999999
nuts yeah they are gonna come after us

1238.98 --> 1246.49
so of course what is going nuts you know

1243.64 --> 1248.17
you can be a silly or wacky or whatever

1246.49 --> 1253.03
as possible

1248.17 --> 1256.0600000000002
just don't go yeah don't go violent

1253.03 --> 1258.27
don't go seriously harassing people even

1256.06 --> 1261.55
if they are Globus

1258.27 --> 1264.46
although yeah you know typical when a

1261.55 --> 1266.62
globe is a total troll and you go to

1264.46 --> 1268.9
totally trolling back I wouldn't

1266.62 --> 1271.3
personally recommend it but yeah that is

1268.9 --> 1274.2
that is kind of understandable but

1271.3 --> 1278.9099999999999
that's not the same as just like

1274.2 --> 1282.55
harassing people that are not dicks or

1278.91 --> 1286.8100000000002
just don't want anything to do it anyway

1282.55 --> 1290.32
people get this you know I don't even

1286.81 --> 1293.44
know why I would need to explain it it's

1290.32 --> 1296.56
just we're very lucky to live in a world

1293.44 --> 1301.51
where we are still being tolerated well

1296.56 --> 1303.31
technically they wouldn't need to well

1301.51 --> 1305.86
would have consequences for especially

1303.31 --> 1307.54
because media and art be sudden

1305.86 --> 1309.85
disappearance of letters this would be a

1307.54 --> 1314.04
big sign on the wall would be big unrest

1309.85 --> 1318.9399999999998
and also free speech again and look even

1314.04 --> 1321.61
insane political speech including

1318.94 --> 1324.039
violence and [ __ ] direct calls for

1321.61 --> 1327.33
violence are being tolerated even

1324.039 --> 1331.119
that's insane so if that's tolerated why

1327.33 --> 1334.35
yeah why would you to then take us down

1331.119 --> 1337.6899999999998
and not them that's absolutely bizarre

1334.35 --> 1340.389
but yeah you have to be careful though

1337.69 --> 1343.509
that if free speech is going to be

1340.389 --> 1346.9289999999999
correct down on them we also may risk

1343.509 --> 1349.929
being at least looked upon have to be

1346.929 --> 1352.269
careful and who knows maybe everyone

1349.929 --> 1355.749
that's at such a point would then

1352.269 --> 1358.359
suddenly be taken under the loop anyway

1355.749 --> 1362.259
just be careful just be a bright example

1358.359 --> 1365.1999999999998
and the best thing is to act as if

1362.259 --> 1368.44
you're being watched and judged at all

1365.2 --> 1370.749
times because whether that's happening

1368.44 --> 1373.269
officially or not that could happen yeah

1370.749 --> 1377.2
sorry leb and thank you you joined I

1373.269 --> 1380.379
kept on rambling thanks for joining the

1377.2 --> 1385.259
show I don't know he's mean how's my

1380.379 --> 1387.6999999999998
sound bits low and who's that better

1385.259 --> 1390.3990000000001
okay it's just um uh I've got a

1387.7 --> 1396.519
microphone I've got a handheld mic and

1390.399 --> 1398.32
the moment saw hello okay you said hello

1396.519 --> 1400.33
to him straight away but you didn't say

1398.32 --> 1403.239
hello Amy straight away alright knows I

1400.33 --> 1404.859
can spell I see here now he just

1403.239 --> 1406.109
happened to join when I started to

1404.859 --> 1412.4789999999998
address yeah I know I know

1406.109 --> 1416.379
we went we have no alpha know the reason

1412.479 --> 1419.44
I waited come on is there was a guy or

1416.379 --> 1423.58
no laughter you're Nathan's and he asked

1419.44 --> 1426.249
our question he gave up

1423.58 --> 1429.759
he gave a Croatian he said right we said

1426.249 --> 1434.8890000000001
f the ball on the F was really really

1429.759 --> 1436.749
really really so big that yeah if you

1434.889 --> 1441.1589999999999
looked over you wouldn't see any car

1436.749 --> 1444.58
mature mm-hmm no Nathan said no right

1441.159 --> 1447.0990000000002
but then for this for argument's sake no

1444.58 --> 1448.509
well he said no but not for argument's

1447.099 --> 1451.45
sake but he said no because he wouldn't

1448.509 --> 1454.419
believe no but technically it could be

1451.45 --> 1456.3990000000001
possible however then all the physics

1454.419 --> 1457.9
and all that [ __ ] yeah yeah actually

1456.399 --> 1459.82
eccentric wise

1457.9 --> 1463.8400000000001
workout anymore yes yup but one saying

1459.82 --> 1467.9199999999998
he said normally but I have to give but

1463.84 --> 1471.6399999999999
I kudos to him Anthony because he said

1467.92 --> 1473.98
okay then he said yeah if it was proven

1471.64 --> 1475.51
to be so begging Bible I yell of course

1473.98 --> 1477.6100000000001
I can understand that you can't you

1475.51 --> 1480.07
couldn't see the curvature but that's

1477.61 --> 1484.4799999999998
not what's happening he came that owns a

1480.07 --> 1486.01
Ansel que la no I have not going Nathan

1484.48 --> 1489.76
or anything laughs I thought was a bit

1486.01 --> 1493.72
disingenuous of him here to see to deny

1489.76 --> 1496.12
it straight away not even hold the cone

1493.72 --> 1498.4
save cover you're meant to do we are

1496.12 --> 1501.52
meant to hold the cordon saved yeah oh

1498.4 --> 1503.74
if it's beg but no but he was red

1501.52 --> 1506.08
herring him luring him into a red

1503.74 --> 1508.66
herring no how'd you know laughs well it

1506.08 --> 1510.58
doesn't we were saying no but it was

1508.66 --> 1513.8200000000002
just mean like no it couldn't be

1510.58 --> 1515.74
possible but rather no I that's not what

1513.82 --> 1519.37
this argument is about it is about the

1515.74 --> 1522.1
heliocentric model and it be that that's

1519.37 --> 1524.9199999999998
what he was basically hammering on yeah

1522.1 --> 1527.11
okay but that's but the point was making

1524.92 --> 1530.38
is the fact he could have said yes of

1527.11 --> 1533.53
course which I would is well do an any

1530.38 --> 1535.93
honest person we do he gave the wrong

1533.53 --> 1538.0
mark I mean he gave the wrong hand so

1535.93 --> 1540.04
there and that's not have not going

1538.0 --> 1543.31
nathan lane of the outer space he's done

1540.04 --> 1545.8
a great job he's not he's done a great

1543.31 --> 1548.95
job he's done a great job he keeps it

1545.8 --> 1551.6499999999999
going and stuff like that but you know

1548.95 --> 1554.71
it's like if we ask a ball i could you

1551.65 --> 1557.19
hold the concept allah and if you know

1554.71 --> 1559.8700000000001
if it was flat blah blah and they say no

1557.19 --> 1562.51
right so we criticize him for that we

1559.87 --> 1563.7399999999998
are meant to be open-minded of course if

1562.51 --> 1565.87
it was huge

1563.74 --> 1569.23
right of course we wouldn't be able to

1565.87 --> 1571.9899999999998
tail but as he made a very salient point

1569.23 --> 1574.75
about in a leak Pontchartrain

1571.99 --> 1576.61
but soundly showed us or whatever right

1574.75 --> 1579.04
ok nothing but the point is that was

1576.61 --> 1581.1999999999998
always thinking a king though it cannot

1579.04 --> 1583.33
go it to me and I have to say respect to

1581.2 --> 1586.72
Antony well I'm trying to B's friend

1583.33 --> 1590.6499999999999
Elena because well I'm more interested

1586.72 --> 1591.3990000000001
not the point was he answered quite

1590.65 --> 1592.929
honestly

1591.399 --> 1595.5089999999998
yeah well you know if it was proven to

1592.929 --> 1597.669
be so big which is true you wouldn't

1595.509 --> 1598.629
bill to see if it was so back but I

1597.669 --> 1601.929
don't believe it

1598.629 --> 1605.4689999999998
it's a eyeballing me it's flies [ __ ] but

1601.929 --> 1609.719
every forum no but the point I was

1605.469 --> 1613.509
making was it was kind of our it was

1609.719 --> 1616.1190000000001
opening up a Nathan to a double

1613.509 --> 1617.739
standards hey from my point of view as a

1616.119 --> 1621.4189999999999
flyer I thought I thought they based on

1617.739 --> 1624.969
zero just a feeling it pinky seriously

1621.419 --> 1627.519
no well oh it's not really look but it's

1624.969 --> 1629.219
just a mistake answers like yeah I could

1627.519 --> 1632.049
have said yes but he didn't want to

1629.219 --> 1635.3200000000002
because he's not focusing on something

1632.049 --> 1637.599
else he was on fire he was in

1635.32 --> 1641.4089999999999
Inquisition but he wasn't going to let

1637.599 --> 1644.889
him walk away from the survey sorry Jay

1641.409 --> 1646.8090000000002
exactly perfect yes I cancel in perfect

1644.889 --> 1650.649
this collection will harm them but is

1646.809 --> 1653.109
that a good thing yeah nice for his show

1650.649 --> 1655.119
it is for his show that is his show it's

1653.109 --> 1657.609
his format that's what he does it's

1655.119 --> 1660.2189999999998
unique to Flat Earth debates that's what

1657.609 --> 1664.9289999999999
he does it does it very well and young

1660.219 --> 1668.009
yes no reason to do so it's not subtle

1664.929 --> 1670.419
but that's not what the show is about

1668.009 --> 1672.94
well and what wait you mean it's a

1670.419 --> 1674.3490000000002
logical if thank you do are we not meant

1672.94 --> 1677.999
to be portraying ourselves have been

1674.349 --> 1680.979
honest and open to everything

1677.999 --> 1683.259
ivory decided merits fly in the stored

1680.979 --> 1685.239
Lee I said no matter what pretty no when

1683.259 --> 1691.029
we can do what the ballers scientific

1685.239 --> 1694.089
proof is concerned no you have to be

1691.029 --> 1695.679
strict you have to be fundamental about

1694.089 --> 1696.96
it that's the thing that's what he's

1695.679 --> 1698.679
trying to do it's not about

1696.96 --> 1702.059
possibilities and reasoning that

1698.679 --> 1702.0590000000002
theorizing that's what I do

1702.359 --> 1708.339
doesn't let you do that not an issue

1705.369 --> 1710.4399999999998
yeah but it's not I know why I'm not

1708.339 --> 1714.279
complaining about it because that's not

1710.44 --> 1717.5800000000002
what that show is about that's why I

1714.279 --> 1723.879
have my show basically show you right

1717.58 --> 1725.1399999999999
right so it's a scientific debate well

1723.879 --> 1727.809
it's a debate show

1725.14 --> 1729.3400000000001
well it is very it's although I could I

1727.809 --> 1731.77
could go out that's that's what

1729.34 --> 1735.78
scientific or Funyuns all right what's

1731.77 --> 1738.429
scientific about the show and this isn't

1735.78 --> 1741.22
recognizes the scientific method as the

1738.429 --> 1744.0400000000002
foundation of all actual science and

1741.22 --> 1746.02
then progresses from that point that's

1744.04 --> 1749.23
what it does that's what the Flat Earth

1746.02 --> 1752.1299999999999
debate is about yeah but that's not

1749.23 --> 1756.04
scientific sure right so yeah that is it

1752.13 --> 1757.39
is foundationally scientific and if

1756.04 --> 1760.9289999999999
something cannot be scientifically

1757.39 --> 1764.41
proven then the arguments that are used

1760.929 --> 1766.39
fall back to basic observations like

1764.41 --> 1771.4
what is it because it's there and that

1766.39 --> 1773.8300000000002
is yeah that's even that's even more

1771.4 --> 1774.5800000000002
fundamental than scientific it's just an

1773.83 --> 1776.83
observation

1774.58 --> 1781.8899999999999
yeah but what's the scientific method

1776.83 --> 1785.9499999999998
then you see it because it's there

1781.89 --> 1788.0200000000002
that's no no logic no I'm feeling that

1785.95 --> 1792.21
something is there there's you see

1788.02 --> 1795.04
something because it's there then yeah

1792.21 --> 1796.419
phenomena yeah I know what let's let's

1795.04 --> 1798.79
get off away what the show is about

1796.419 --> 1803.74
what's the scientific method in

1798.79 --> 1809.5
scientific method isn't is to determine

1803.74 --> 1812.98
a cause of the phenomenon dependent and

1809.5 --> 1813.61
an in that's a reason well that's our

1812.98 --> 1815.919
goal

1813.61 --> 1817.9289999999999
alas no um if that's the function that's

1815.919 --> 1820.3600000000001
the function of the scientific method to

1817.929 --> 1822.88
find the cause and panache of the

1820.36 --> 1824.9399999999998
function last year for two wars what is

1822.88 --> 1828.5200000000002
the scientific method not the function

1824.94 --> 1832.24
it's a magnet I'm fine way from what is

1828.52 --> 1835.95
amazing a method methodology it is a

1832.24 --> 1840.16
system it is a system of contacts and

1835.95 --> 1844.0
yeah it works well it works very

1840.16 --> 1847.9
basically and the basicity the basicness

1844.0 --> 1853.87
of it is what is so what makes it so

1847.9 --> 1856.3000000000002
reliable may I ask you a question on

1853.87 --> 1857.8999999999999
this show I mean I missed a lot of it

1856.3 --> 1860.81
yet what has been

1857.9 --> 1863.96
in scientifically-proven regarding Flat

1860.81 --> 1873.25
Earth what have what has been proven

1863.96 --> 1873.25
there like just wondering right well

1875.2 --> 1880.25
well let me be cannot take that one all

1877.52 --> 1882.02
but you can shape the very you can vary

1880.25 --> 1884.51
the shape of the earth so technically

1882.02 --> 1888.34
you can scientifically prove that no

1884.51 --> 1892.37
very academically aware are just yeah

1888.34 --> 1895.36
look science science is is not very

1892.37 --> 1898.1899999999998
handy when it comes to Cosmo Jeannie

1895.36 --> 1900.9199999999998
they occupy thing also about Sciences

1898.19 --> 1903.65
you have to have the complete data or

1900.92 --> 1906.8300000000002
you're going to be grabbing in the midst

1903.65 --> 1910.76
right so we can scientifically prove

1906.83 --> 1914.27
it's flat but yeah the geometrical

1910.76 --> 1917.39
deductions and the very workings of site

1914.27 --> 1920.0
itself and all these elements yeah we

1917.39 --> 1923.18
can reverse engineer how things work and

1920.0 --> 1925.01
then come to a foundational conclusion

1923.18 --> 1929.44
because of the long distance straight

1925.01 --> 1932.45
line of sight that it is not

1929.44 --> 1936.3200000000002
geometrically the ball that is said it

1932.45 --> 1939.41
is and yeah it is flat or as good as

1936.32 --> 1943.58
flat and who knows if it's huge

1939.41 --> 1947.3600000000001
then it might turn into a big cone or it

1943.58 --> 1949.85
might turn into a huge ball or something

1947.36 --> 1952.03
but that doesn't necessarily have to be

1949.85 --> 1954.98
that way again if you presuppose that

1952.03 --> 1956.54
then you presuppose a full geometrical

1954.98 --> 1961.13
shape then you have to prove that for

1956.54 --> 1964.7
geometrical shape but yeah it could be

1961.13 --> 1967.22
some kind of geometrical shape but it

1964.7 --> 1969.41
doesn't seem to be we have no reason to

1967.22 --> 1972.76
believe it other than that people would

1969.41 --> 1976.3000000000002
say it is and thus the most foundational

1972.76 --> 1978.59
conclusion left is that it's flat so

1976.3 --> 1981.02
like we're on top

1978.59 --> 1983.54
Xander Xander Oobleck it cannot give you

1981.02 --> 1986.66
mind so and then you can address it

1983.54 --> 1987.17
early to answers they'll be okay they're

1986.66 --> 1990.3200000000002
gone

1987.17 --> 1992.8100000000002
are they okay hey well

1990.32 --> 1996.2
it hasn't been scientifically proven

1992.81 --> 1998.4199999999998
right and I told you I know wait a

1996.2 --> 2001.54
minute where my an attitude and Akhil

1998.42 --> 2002.26
and a leader plane does not account for

2001.54 --> 2007.3
gravy

2002.26 --> 2009.37
so therefore the bombing to me that I -

2007.3 --> 2012.3999999999999
then the keel in an airplane is

2009.37 --> 2016.0
specifically designed by man to show

2012.4 --> 2017.3700000000001
level flight there you go nice mind so

2016.0 --> 2021.61
short and sweet

2017.37 --> 2023.4099999999999
right but yeah but but that's the what

2021.61 --> 2025.1499999999999
but what that's that's barely no

2023.41 --> 2028.0900000000001
observation this is a thing that's been

2025.15 --> 2031.3000000000002
built by my problem is is that look

2028.09 --> 2033.82
Globus use geometrical are based

2031.3 --> 2036.07
reasoning so when they will just say

2033.82 --> 2038.8
like because of no I say because of the

2036.07 --> 2041.4399999999998
orientation I said without within the

2038.8 --> 2043.81
elements that are pre supposedly yeah

2041.44 --> 2045.7
if you move level you're gonna move over

2043.81 --> 2047.26
the globe if you're gonna look over

2045.7 --> 2049.2400000000002
straight surface you're actually looking

2047.26 --> 2051.79
over a curved surface right but you must

2049.24 --> 2054.4289999999996
ask oh but they will always keep doing

2051.79 --> 2057.879
that right you must my point I said it

2054.429 --> 2060.01
hasn't been scientifically proven there

2057.879 --> 2063.19
are not 'true than the keel in any other

2060.01 --> 2065.98
plane it has been designed specifically

2063.19 --> 2069.01
we got alpha T in mind that's all and

2065.98 --> 2071.77
that's er right right sorts no it's not

2069.01 --> 2073.4190000000003
no it's not proof thing that's been

2071.77 --> 2075.55
designed to sure when something is

2073.419 --> 2078.79
flying off label hasn't been designed

2075.55 --> 2082.4190000000003
with the algorithm ah gravity doesn't

2078.79 --> 2084.82
pro enough why not because it is

2082.419 --> 2087.52
gyroscope based and the funny thing

2084.82 --> 2090.82
about gyroscopes specifically is that

2087.52 --> 2093.46
they are untouched orientation wise by

2090.82 --> 2096.4900000000002
any forces applying to them that's their

2093.46 --> 2098.95
unique element our reality is not

2096.49 --> 2103.2099999999996
relevant even if it was a force and not

2098.95 --> 2105.6699999999996
just an aberration yep I specifically

2103.21 --> 2110.83
designed to show when something is not

2105.67 --> 2112.96
flying a a straight AB and I'll level

2110.83 --> 2115.54
with the ground right yeah but that's

2112.96 --> 2118.9
only because I always say is in its

2115.54 --> 2123.43
orientation in fact by external forces

2118.9 --> 2123.88
exactly so so there is no when I went on

2123.43 --> 2127.21
a

2123.88 --> 2130.299
Jayda Scott has moved off an angle the

2127.21 --> 2133.48
gyroscope will remains the same right

2130.299 --> 2135.779
but the angle will be registered by the

2133.48 --> 2139.119
instrument that has been designed by man

2135.779 --> 2142.66
to see when this is not flying according

2139.119 --> 2145.539
to the gyroscope that remains exactly

2142.66 --> 2148.18
where it's been spun up whatever this

2145.539 --> 2150.279
remember it begins to spend they will

2148.18 --> 2154.45
hold that it won't point north or south

2150.279 --> 2157.93
if you lean it 45-degree elevation but

2154.45 --> 2160.3289999999997
not lessons but not spend not up it will

2157.93 --> 2162.94
go on forever and ever another the only

2160.329 --> 2165.1600000000003
reason I think that you are arguing

2162.94 --> 2169.359
against me and it's because of the fact

2165.16 --> 2172.1189999999997
is you actually believe that there is a

2169.359 --> 2175.0
force pushing or pulling on objects

2172.119 --> 2180.099
going through are you talking about Ali

2175.0 --> 2182.529
no you see gravity exists there is a

2180.099 --> 2185.38
fourth look seriously when's the last

2182.529 --> 2186.94
time you've paid attention because I've

2185.38 --> 2187.839
been talking about this for over two

2186.94 --> 2189.46
months all right

2187.839 --> 2191.349
I already admitted there is no

2189.46 --> 2192.9700000000003
scientific proof for gravity it is an

2191.349 --> 2194.17
aberration and I explained oh but you

2192.97 --> 2196.93
see what that means

2194.17 --> 2201.549
you see those are force no there's not

2196.93 --> 2205.48
it just it comes it's there are elements

2201.549 --> 2208.72
around anomalies I for when on vinson us

2205.48 --> 2211.15
naturally to assume there is a force but

2208.72 --> 2213.6699999999996
you can't prove it okay so aberration

2211.15 --> 2216.13
right my apologies I haven't I haven't I

2213.67 --> 2219.789
don't know you'd change your a stance on

2216.13 --> 2222.779
that so why then why then would you be

2219.789 --> 2226.42
so against gyroscope which is known

2222.779 --> 2228.339
whatever possession it is filed up on it

2226.42 --> 2232.359
starts spinning it will hold that

2228.339 --> 2236.41
possession and and when it's fed into

2232.359 --> 2239.019
our a mechanism that has to show whether

2236.41 --> 2242.3799999999997
an object using the gyroscope

2239.019 --> 2244.8089999999997
when an object comes off in the angle

2242.38 --> 2249.039
that the gyroscope we say Harlan

2244.809 --> 2251.5
why would you argue against our I don't

2249.039 --> 2253.9
know what you're trying to say here hey

2251.5 --> 2255.309
okay right over yeah that's my fault no

2253.9 --> 2257.65
and that is my fault I'm not explaining

2255.309 --> 2260.6800000000003
right so we can use a star

2257.65 --> 2262.779
off a gyroscope and you have a helping

2260.68 --> 2264.49
technical off to the ground for example

2262.779 --> 2268.96
yeah right

2264.49 --> 2271.99
know that Janice call will steer in that

2268.96 --> 2276.309
position Pepe perpendicular to the

2271.99 --> 2281.2
ground unless a force is acted upon and

2276.309 --> 2283.21
I rate or the orientations changes

2281.2 --> 2286.0
yeah I'd know it no a force no no

2283.21 --> 2288.279
audience I will not move not the

2286.0 --> 2290.98
orientation if I'm the orientation

2288.279 --> 2293.5
matters it will move but the force miles

2290.98 --> 2297.52
before the orientation the orientation

2293.5 --> 2303.22
if I put a force or oriented gyroscopes

2297.52 --> 2307.15
make forces irrelevant thank you really

2303.22 --> 2311.1899999999996
Alan so why why then are you so against

2307.15 --> 2314.17
when I fire up a gyroscope oh no and now

2311.19 --> 2316.359
I do then the care why you so against

2314.17 --> 2320.109
the factor that would prove that either

2316.359 --> 2324.88
plane is not flaming the ball that's a

2320.109 --> 2327.13
straw man and what's a straw man input I

2324.88 --> 2331.42
mean what definitional behalf of me of

2327.13 --> 2333.579
saying something that I don't why let's

2331.42 --> 2335.829
see yeah those were I said you were

2333.579 --> 2339.549
against I said you were against I would

2335.829 --> 2341.44
I be against that well I could see I

2339.549 --> 2344.44
never said that or say all Manning you

2341.44 --> 2347.859
write it is okay because you're seeing

2344.44 --> 2349.7200000000003
that a Janus Corp is not proof of our

2347.859 --> 2352.27
fly else did I say that

2349.72 --> 2353.95
no yes you did actually you when you

2352.27 --> 2356.47
only try it in your bunk

2353.95 --> 2358.319
you try totally trade debunk oh well you

2356.47 --> 2361.27
said that no rowing the boat race in a

2358.319 --> 2361.8089999999997
gyroscope we proved nothing and blah

2361.27 --> 2364.599
blah

2361.809 --> 2366.2200000000003
did I no I did not say that at all I've

2364.599 --> 2367.69
never said that why are we having this

2366.22 --> 2369.5989999999997
discussion why didn't you just I don't

2367.69 --> 2372.01
know because you're strong man me

2369.599 --> 2373.6600000000003
suggesting that I that I disagree with

2372.01 --> 2376.869
that Jack no but you were like are

2373.66 --> 2378.359
actually you are useful in in figuring

2376.869 --> 2382.42
out the orientation but you are

2378.359 --> 2385.18
adversarial against who are we same no I

2382.42 --> 2389.049
just said we will it is technically

2385.18 --> 2391.39
impossible to scientifically prove the

2389.049 --> 2394.119
shape of the earth scientifically

2391.39 --> 2396.549
find evidence that's another matter

2394.119 --> 2398.799
there's a lot a lot of evidence but

2396.549 --> 2400.809
scientifically prove it you got a very

2398.799 --> 2402.0099999999998
it and you can't vary the shape of the

2400.809 --> 2404.8900000000003
earth that's the problem it's a

2402.01 --> 2407.529
technical problem well I mean you're

2404.89 --> 2409.0589999999997
gonna only audio [ __ ] yeah if when it

2407.529 --> 2410.67
totally Hoff this soldier I was talking

2409.059 --> 2412.6600000000003
about but the point is that's what

2410.67 --> 2415.599
happened I wouldn't be having this

2412.66 --> 2418.24
conversation we trying to stand up for

2415.599 --> 2420.46
gyroscopes and say hey by the way that's

2418.24 --> 2421.0
if you just agreed with me in the first

2420.46 --> 2423.76
place

2421.0 --> 2425.95
so obviously you said something again

2423.76 --> 2427.119
for I said though otherwise I wouldn't

2425.95 --> 2429.43
be having this conversation

2427.119 --> 2431.109
no it'd be a given and we were the moved

2429.43 --> 2433.029
oriented this conversation out of

2431.109 --> 2435.88
nothing by assuming that I opposed you

2433.029 --> 2439.059
and I did not no no you opposed me first

2435.88 --> 2442.359
no I did no I oppose you and you said

2439.059 --> 2444.4500000000003
that there is scientific proof that the

2442.359 --> 2447.069
earth is flat

2444.45 --> 2450.16
then what the lights read with that is

2447.069 --> 2451.93
right right well precisely right so the

2450.16 --> 2455.71
science is being done on a gyroscope

2451.93 --> 2457.69
right yeah yeah yeah it's been done

2455.71 --> 2462.16
hasn't her so I science right so if you

2457.69 --> 2463.7200000000003
no no that's no that's mechanics so

2462.16 --> 2465.91
that's not just knowing how there's

2463.72 --> 2468.069
nothing to do with science fray okay so

2465.91 --> 2469.48
my okay life state like so the

2468.069 --> 2472.75
scientific method is you have a

2469.48 --> 2476.529
hypothesis you a high-poverty hypotheses

2472.75 --> 2479.559
right or a theory right okay you have an

2476.529 --> 2482.47
idea you see observe something right

2479.559 --> 2484.21
you see perhaps you see that gyroscopes

2482.47 --> 2486.759
panning and you'd do it definitely

2484.21 --> 2492.16
experience only say oh by the way that

2486.759 --> 2494.14
always seems to stand a be a pair it

2492.16 --> 2497.0789999999997
doesn't move and lace up with a force

2494.14 --> 2498.7
opponent right so you see right okay I

2497.079 --> 2501.009
wonder when eyes know they can't work

2498.7 --> 2503.589
out what is doesn't move enough known

2501.009 --> 2506.7400000000002
what it does move when you apply a force

2503.589 --> 2510.73
it it that that's not what it does is

2506.74 --> 2513.549
change its orientation I said it doesn't

2510.73 --> 2516.039
move if you don't apply a forester or it

2513.549 --> 2518.74
moves when you apply a force step how is

2516.039 --> 2521.5
that relevant any every object does that

2518.74 --> 2523.5089999999996
right okay I'm going to see something

2521.5 --> 2524.95
new right I was talking to my friend

2523.509 --> 2529.9900000000002
Elodie a crash

2524.95 --> 2531.91
Jackson advice subscribe him right but

2529.99 --> 2533.74
the point was I was going to see I said

2531.91 --> 2535.8999999999996
you know what class I found out the

2533.74 --> 2538.8689999999997
other thing I was I was talking to my

2535.9 --> 2540.4
mainstream friends however and I was

2538.869 --> 2542.02
actually having a conversation with them

2540.4 --> 2544.96
and they were listening to what I was

2542.02 --> 2546.64
seeing in common right and I think

2544.96 --> 2549.07
what's happened in the flat health a

2546.64 --> 2553.8689999999997
community and you've just proved that

2549.07 --> 2556.15
they are as it's actually well we're

2553.869 --> 2558.94
fighting amongst ourselves if I come up

2556.15 --> 2562.57
in fact come or if someone comes up well

2558.94 --> 2566.109
I will owe a word you're actually

2562.57 --> 2568.15
suggesting that I'm fighting yeah well

2566.109 --> 2570.13
you're arguing against me I mean the

2568.15 --> 2573.01
point about a gyroscope that proves we

2570.13 --> 2577.2000000000003
think and you know I'm not arguing I'm

2573.01 --> 2579.01
correcting you that's what I'm doing and

2577.2 --> 2582.39
I'm not sorry

2579.01 --> 2585.3100000000004
hello gyroscope or beautify I have a

2582.39 --> 2589.9
look what did you correct me on name

2585.31 --> 2592.21
regarding gyroscopes well about what is

2589.9 --> 2594.7000000000003
unique about them you explained it wrong

2592.21 --> 2596.68
and before that I correct how did I know

2594.7 --> 2598.99
scientific method and your base

2596.68 --> 2600.819
assumptions about it right okay so right

2598.99 --> 2604.359
we'll start from the beginning what did

2600.819 --> 2606.43
I say wrong about gyroscopes well you

2604.359 --> 2609.46
said that if you want to prove it

2606.43 --> 2612.3689999999997
scientifically that you have to observe

2609.46 --> 2615.25
a phenomenon as in moving it well moving

2612.369 --> 2617.77
it is completely irrelevant because any

2615.25 --> 2620.74
object will move when you apply a force

2617.77 --> 2622.48
to it normally that's not what's unique

2620.74 --> 2625.839
about a gyroscope the only really

2622.48 --> 2628.9900000000002
relevant phenomena that really makes the

2625.839 --> 2632.0499999999997
gyroscope unique is that no matter what

2628.99 --> 2634.99
you do with it no matter how you rotate

2632.05 --> 2637.119
the outer shell the thing that's holding

2634.99 --> 2639.6699999999996
it it's always going to maintain its

2637.119 --> 2641.8
orientation when it's fun of that is the

2639.67 --> 2644.53
unique effect about it that is the

2641.8 --> 2648.01
property that we can utilize to deduce

2644.53 --> 2649.44
the shape of the earth basically but

2648.01 --> 2652.69
it's going to be a deduction

2649.44 --> 2653.77
well yeah maybe well you know I'll take

2652.69 --> 2655.9900000000002
the blame for that maybe you're

2653.77 --> 2658.87
misunderstood max a by another said da

2655.99 --> 2662.5299999999997
now a gyroscope doesn't move when yup

2658.87 --> 2665.5899999999997
for step that's not what I said

2662.53 --> 2669.94
seriously no actor to hang out here all

2665.59 --> 2672.82
over the place do but what did you just

2669.94 --> 2675.25
say them you said the acid if you move

2672.82 --> 2678.4300000000003
if he ate a apply a force to a gyroscope

2675.25 --> 2681.79
it doesn't move I didn't see a lot on I

2678.43 --> 2684.16
said that it moves you said the opposite

2681.79 --> 2686.95
I said you said the opposite and you did

2684.16 --> 2688.5699999999997
well I'd better planning I said the

2686.95 --> 2693.0099999999998
opposite that's bizarre

2688.57 --> 2695.2000000000003
I said when applying the a force it's a

2693.01 --> 2698.53
gyroscope it doesn't move is that what I

2695.2 --> 2702.22
said no that's what you just said

2698.53 --> 2704.92
nothing you just said I said that no you

2702.22 --> 2705.7599999999998
didn't and I make sure I'm getting sick

2704.92 --> 2708.4900000000002
of this Ali

2705.76 --> 2710.5600000000004
you're so all over the place we can all

2708.49 --> 2713.35
listen back to this stuff good can I'm

2710.56 --> 2715.69
kind of sick of it so I says well you're

2713.35 --> 2717.5499999999997
you're you are trying to create friction

2715.69 --> 2719.32
you're trying to create a fight you're

2717.55 --> 2722.29
suggesting we're all in fighting and

2719.32 --> 2724.6000000000004
you're constantly bringing out these out

2722.29 --> 2726.2799999999997
of nowhere switcheroo strongman's of

2724.6 --> 2727.8399999999997
things that I'm supposed to be claiming

2726.28 --> 2731.1600000000003
that I'm saying that I'm obviously not

2727.84 --> 2736.1800000000003
I'm kind of sick about it so cut it out

2731.16 --> 2741.27
okay now yeah I think yeah right okay

2736.18 --> 2741.27
right device you go back and watch the

2741.48 --> 2745.51
definitely will

2743.02 --> 2747.28
goodbye is probably - my memory is

2745.51 --> 2749.6200000000003
pretty solid when it comes to these kind

2747.28 --> 2750.9700000000003
of things okay that's okay that's great

2749.62 --> 2753.22
probably have for yourself

2750.97 --> 2756.0099999999998
you can't fool me even if it's not on

2753.22 --> 2758.5
purpose I'm not saying it's nefarious

2756.01 --> 2760.7200000000003
cuz I've seen you get confused with

2758.5 --> 2763.63
these things before I'm not blaming you

2760.72 --> 2766.99
as somebody that's doing that on purpose

2763.63 --> 2769.9
thank you but you're messing up I am the

2766.99 --> 2772.54
optician actually earthing that you're

2769.9 --> 2775.81
messing up here I I take no offense to

2772.54 --> 2777.91
you see me Mason up a whole duh

2775.81 --> 2779.68
a whole dollar gratitude that you say

2777.91 --> 2782.35
that not being the fairies and you don't

2779.68 --> 2785.0099999999998
think I'm that I'm being efficient I

2782.35 --> 2787.5699999999997
appreciate that I really do I really do

2785.01 --> 2790.5400000000004
there's some frustration leaking through

2787.57 --> 2792.4300000000003
but it's not nefarious I can feel it

2790.54 --> 2794.38
good good thank you

2792.43 --> 2797.819
yeah that's good enough for me but maybe

2794.38 --> 2802.569
and it's obviously I'm not very good

2797.819 --> 2805.0589999999997
communicating my would you call my

2802.569 --> 2806.95
meaning very well and that's what's

2805.059 --> 2807.46
happened as a misunderstanding going on

2806.95 --> 2809.68
here

2807.46 --> 2813.88
okay nothing the point I was making was

2809.68 --> 2815.97
probably dyslexia related please I'll

2813.88 --> 2819.25
just say one thing but please when you

2815.97 --> 2821.23
be a wheel right or even just look out

2819.25 --> 2824.859
right stand back from the sink and just

2821.23 --> 2826.599
look up and imagine me when you see

2824.859 --> 2829.049
something happen now you've got loads of

2826.599 --> 2832.319
proof illustrate you get attacked

2829.049 --> 2834.7
because it goes against our certain

2832.319 --> 2839.5
assembly and you know that's a heritage

2834.7 --> 2841.3289999999997
yeah even on your own side that there's

2839.5 --> 2843.609
no more common doesn't know or lassen

2841.329 --> 2845.8590000000004
traced in armand or that is there and

2843.609 --> 2847.5389999999998
that's not right okay there's none of

2845.859 --> 2851.47
that it's straight away just what you

2847.539 --> 2853.779
don't immediacy if you look back you use

2851.47 --> 2856.24
your understand what I'm meaning here we

2853.779 --> 2858.099
will have enough conversation I'm on the

2856.24 --> 2860.319
same side is you me I believe they

2858.099 --> 2862.809
office [ __ ] flower I believe it's

2860.319 --> 2866.2889999999998
flat right ok there's no other we are on

2862.809 --> 2869.3190000000004
the same side but yet yet if I gave map

2866.289 --> 2872.5
I mean or you give your opinion suddenly

2869.319 --> 2875.68
we get attacked for even though were on

2872.5 --> 2877.779
the same side it should be more of less

2875.68 --> 2879.7599999999998
untraced no I don't quite I give even a

2877.779 --> 2881.859
blah blah I think you're wrong rather

2879.76 --> 2884.079
than getting triggered by it it should

2881.859 --> 2886.0
be but it's just one attack on you are

2884.079 --> 2888.19
when I'm just pointing out a few things

2886.0 --> 2890.17
no but I'm giving you a response saying

2888.19 --> 2892.059
yeah look it should be but it's not

2890.17 --> 2896.41
because Flat Earth is unique in that

2892.059 --> 2900.25
sense it has these heavily personal

2896.41 --> 2902.049
counter conditioning against it and

2900.25 --> 2905.02
that's what we're facing in sports yeah

2902.049 --> 2907.569
we're gonna be facing for a few fight

2905.02 --> 2909.73
against are when were fighting against

2907.569 --> 2913.0589999999997
dieted yet were portraying the same

2909.73 --> 2916.089
[ __ ] attitudes as always that's what

2913.059 --> 2918.549
happens so no right the enemy you become

2916.089 --> 2920.8289999999997
the enemy one way or the other I'm in

2918.549 --> 2923.589
Denmark right I live in Denmark and it's

2920.829 --> 2924.849
not yeah you can't just blatantly accept

2923.589 --> 2926.0499999999997
it right they've got a great scene in

2924.849 --> 2928.78
Denmark right

2926.05 --> 2931.0600000000004
I could give a lecture on how corrupt

2928.78 --> 2933.82
the government was there people with

2931.06 --> 2937.33
academia but they would see Sadhna livre

2933.82 --> 2939.82
right and that means such is life so

2937.33 --> 2942.4
like even though you know it's bad you

2939.82 --> 2944.86
accept and as I'm not gonna accept that

2942.4 --> 2947.4700000000003
I want a discussion I don't want to get

2944.86 --> 2949.6
attacked when I come up with my ideas or

2947.47 --> 2952.2999999999997
something and I'm sure you don't I know

2949.6 --> 2953.92
and this is it brothers so many options

2952.3 --> 2957.4
but you motion has their own

2953.92 --> 2959.23
consequences I weighed them all you're

2957.4 --> 2961.1800000000003
given you're given what you're doing

2959.23 --> 2963.1
this is you're given excuses for a

2961.18 --> 2965.83
certain attitude that is that doesn't

2963.1 --> 2968.98
belong in the fly off it's a discussion

2965.83 --> 2971.65
it's not [ __ ] to be or an argument we

2968.98 --> 2974.7400000000002
don't debate amongst ourselves discuss

2971.65 --> 2977.23
things right we debate where ball our

2974.74 --> 2980.41
thoughts but we discuss things amongst

2977.23 --> 2983.29
ourselves or we should but we don't we

2980.41 --> 2985.8399999999997
we fall into the same trap Izzy if I can

2983.29 --> 2987.73
what we are you guys Ellie you have to

2985.84 --> 2990.55
come on dude you have to think about

2987.73 --> 2994.03
this step back for a moment it's logical

2990.55 --> 2996.9100000000003
because I yeah oh no listen shut up for

2994.03 --> 3001.6800000000003
a moment let me talk okay the ballers

2996.91 --> 3004.83
have a model they are like an empire

3001.68 --> 3007.5299999999997
with one narrative and that's always how

3004.83 --> 3011.31
it works and if you deviate then you get

3007.53 --> 3014.46
slapped down you get call out until you

3011.31 --> 3018.99
conform again flat earthers is exactly

3014.46 --> 3021.21
the opposite we don't have a singular

3018.99 --> 3025.16
model not even close and there's ideas

3021.21 --> 3030.83
all over the place and we have troubling

3025.16 --> 3034.5299999999997
yeah trouble mustering a foundation and

3030.83 --> 3037.65
and a band and the lack of uniformity

3034.53 --> 3039.1800000000003
makes it even harder because a lot of

3037.65 --> 3040.98
people will want things their own way

3039.18 --> 3044.1299999999997
and that'll get in the way of

3040.98 --> 3047.07
cooperation that's natural you can't

3044.13 --> 3051.48
avoid it because yeah we're not a

3047.07 --> 3055.5
centralized thing we are basically

3051.48 --> 3058.53
helped together by the opposition that

3055.5 --> 3059.88
forces us to seek each other out just to

3058.53 --> 3062.76
avoid the

3059.88 --> 3065.94
the psychological warfare but yeah we

3062.76 --> 3070.05
are still dealing with issues and yeah

3065.94 --> 3072.6
we will have conflict with each other it

3070.05 --> 3074.01
all just depends on how you respond to

3072.6 --> 3077.46
this are you just gonna work out the

3074.01 --> 3080.09
conflicts get angry maybe whatever work

3077.46 --> 3083.52
it out or are you gonna be a gospel

3080.09 --> 3085.83
gossip person that's just gonna [ __ ] all

3083.52 --> 3086.49
over everyone and everything that's the

3085.83 --> 3089.34
difference

3086.49 --> 3092.52
I just can't avoid the friction it's

3089.34 --> 3097.13
impossible so can we go back to the

3092.52 --> 3103.55
gyroscopes real quick so gyroscopes

3097.13 --> 3108.05
let's say gyroscopes in the in the

3103.55 --> 3113.15
airplanes the artificial horizon

3108.05 --> 3116.07
apparently they do level themselves they

3113.15 --> 3119.28
when you turn them around they level

3116.07 --> 3122.2200000000003
themselves really really slowly until

3119.28 --> 3126.36
they all they're real level to the

3122.22 --> 3128.49
ground again so I mean I'm a I'm kind of

3126.36 --> 3132.4500000000003
flattered for yet the argument with the

3128.49 --> 3135.5099999999998
gyroscopes never really convinced me to

3132.45 --> 3138.12
a flat earth and never seen Howard but

3135.51 --> 3144.15
that's part of the effects no but they

3138.12 --> 3148.44
do are it look in force especially if

3144.15 --> 3150.42
sudden can disorient a gyroscope and

3148.44 --> 3154.68
that's where the pendulous fans are for

3150.42 --> 3158.88
to prevent that shift but yeah they will

3154.68 --> 3162.66
eventually the force that is constantly

3158.88 --> 3167.28
going there will force it back into the

3162.66 --> 3170.25
original orientation yeah actual retro

3167.28 --> 3173.46
not a relative to any force because the

3170.25 --> 3176.91
yeah the a persistent force is not

3173.46 --> 3178.85
relevant it's only certain force that

3176.91 --> 3183.69
actually can change your orientation

3178.85 --> 3186.8399999999997
temporarily but it's just it's always

3183.69 --> 3191.7000000000003
gonna maintain its or its actual actual

3186.84 --> 3193.46
real spacial geometrical orientation and

3191.7 --> 3200.33
I'm going to adapt to any

3193.46 --> 3203.69
every direction yeah I never did I never

3200.33 --> 3205.839
understood how gyroscopes disproof a

3203.69 --> 3208.43
globe or for how they prove a flat earth

3205.839 --> 3211.52
because they do orientate themselves

3208.43 --> 3217.5699999999997
again when you turn them around so what

3211.52 --> 3217.57
I never got a nice plate that's in place

3217.75 --> 3223.28
it is about traveling with no scopes I

3221.24 --> 3225.9199999999996
own let me let me just fire on nil then

3223.28 --> 3228.4700000000003
whether they know what what they do is

3225.92 --> 3231.14
the the giant scope when you see a

3228.47 --> 3234.56
horizontal horizon on the aeroplane

3231.14 --> 3237.2
right it's not the gyroscope that's

3234.56 --> 3241.2999999999997
that's actually causing that thing is

3237.2 --> 3245.5699999999997
shaft it's the movement of the airplane

3241.3 --> 3246.5
yeah well well it wasn't so it doesn't

3245.57 --> 3250.67
connect yourself

3246.5 --> 3253.13
no no that's absolutely wrong no that's

3250.67 --> 3259.46
wrong what saying we might be quiet

3253.13 --> 3261.589
because let me see this is a right

3259.46 --> 3262.88
exactly you've just made my point well I

3261.589 --> 3266.96
was talking about two [ __ ] minutes

3262.88 --> 3269.63
yeah sorry I'm done with that you're

3266.96 --> 3271.91
wrong absolutely wrong that's not how it

3269.63 --> 3275.6600000000003
works at all and the show is about to

3271.91 --> 3280.73
end so sorry Ally I'm just I'm done with

3275.66 --> 3283.46
that [ __ ] so is in there for coming and

3280.73 --> 3286.07
thank you alley for coming for as long

3283.46 --> 3290.619
as it lasted I'm gonna run out the show

3286.07 --> 3293.21
right now because it's yeah it's time

3290.619 --> 3295.52
indeed yeah come back any time thanks

3293.21 --> 3298.73
for coming thank you so thank you

3295.52 --> 3301.19
everybody in check you've been very very

3298.73 --> 3302.89
active didn't really see everything has

3301.19 --> 3305.3
talked about I will look at it later

3302.89 --> 3307.1299999999997
thank you all for coming and make sure

3305.3 --> 3309.44
to subscribe to my channel and upload

3307.13 --> 3313.94
this video and share it on social media

3309.44 --> 3315.26
if you have any I hope you thought it

3313.94 --> 3319.13
was an interesting discussion I

3315.26 --> 3320.69
certainly did and I will see you on the

3319.13 --> 3326.4100000000003
debates and all stratas early bird

3320.69 --> 3326.41
number 30 tomorrow until then keep it
