sorry for starting a little

99.52 --> 103.67999999999999
or a lot late i'm gonna have a short

101.68 --> 106.159
show today

103.68 --> 106.159
because

106.399 --> 110.399
yeah

107.36 --> 110.399
not feeling great

110.56 --> 115.52
yeah the weather right now is kind of

113.119 --> 117.84
cloudy

115.52 --> 120.399
but in the morning it was really sunny

117.84 --> 123.04
but then they trailed

120.399 --> 125.119
the skies like all hell

123.04 --> 128.87900000000002
and it turned into this

125.119 --> 130.64
in the course of like three hours

128.879 --> 133.2
i had a walk

130.64 --> 133.2
outside

134.64 --> 138.07999999999998
basically yeah enjoying that

137.2 --> 141.2
sun

138.08 --> 141.20000000000002
while it was still there

141.36 --> 146.4
going out

142.64 --> 148.95899999999997
like oh birds everywhere

146.4 --> 153.59900000000002
and oh yeah the tree the trees over

148.959 --> 153.599
there are now truly starting to blossom

154.959 --> 159.519
so i guess they needed that little extra

157.28 --> 159.519
heat

160.239 --> 164.56
because they're blossoming now really

162.16 --> 167.04
nice can't wait until they're full

164.56 --> 167.04
blossom

167.36 --> 170.36
right

174.0 --> 177.0
ugh

184.08 --> 188.959
hello elise g first in chat jeff gas

186.8 --> 191.59900000000002
head matthew hall

188.959 --> 191.599
good to see you

194.72 --> 200.319
yeah i'm not doing all that great

197.599 --> 201.35999999999999
like last night my jaw started to play

200.319 --> 203.04
up again

201.36 --> 204.72000000000003
and like really

203.04 --> 207.84
really bad

204.72 --> 207.84
i've been pretty much

208.48 --> 213.92
half asleep the entire

210.84 --> 216.08
night because it was just so painful and

213.92 --> 216.07999999999998
like

216.4 --> 220.159
like it's moving there like it suddenly

218.72 --> 222.72
it's just like tension builds up and

220.159 --> 226.0
then like clap clack

222.72 --> 228.959
jolting alt like

226.0 --> 233.36
not having a good time

228.959 --> 233.36
but yeah i've been through this before

233.439 --> 237.519
usually it doesn't last super long

237.92 --> 242.23899999999998
it's probably not my

240.64 --> 244.07999999999998
my teeth

242.239 --> 247.20000000000002
but yeah it's

244.08 --> 249.43900000000002
it's just the way this one tooth is

247.2 --> 252.07999999999998
set

249.439 --> 254.319
when there's like slight inflammation up

252.08 --> 256.16
there in my jaw going it it kind of

254.319 --> 259.519
pushes against

256.16 --> 261.04
the nerve endings and it's not pleasant

259.519 --> 263.6
is it swollen

261.04 --> 264.40000000000003
i don't know if it's well maybe it is

263.6 --> 265.759
it's

264.4 --> 269.75899999999996
it's all

265.759 --> 272.08000000000004
painful like it's it's radiated like

269.759 --> 274.72
like even in my lower jaw i can just i

272.08 --> 277.75899999999996
can feel it here and it makes absolutely

274.72 --> 282.28000000000003
no sense because it's in my upper jaw

277.759 --> 282.28000000000003
but yeah that's really unpleasant

283.52 --> 287.44
but i at least wanted to come on to

285.199 --> 290.479
basically share that info that yeah i

287.44 --> 292.08
might if this persists

290.479 --> 295.03999999999996
i might not show up

292.08 --> 295.03999999999996
tomorrow at all

295.28 --> 299.35999999999996
until it's just died down again in a bit

297.6 --> 303.28000000000003
more tenable

299.36 --> 303.28000000000003
because it is super distracting and

305.199 --> 308.479
although funnily enough now that i'm

306.96 --> 312.32
doing this stream

308.479 --> 312.32
it is slightly going away a bit

313.12 --> 316.0
ugh

314.56 --> 319.44
right

316.0 --> 322.84
the only real pain relief i'm taking is

319.44 --> 322.84
like paracetamol

323.6 --> 327.759
it's not really helping but i also know

326.0 --> 330.32
it kind of like helps against

327.759 --> 333.039
inflammation so that should like

330.32 --> 334.479
directly influence the symptoms

333.039 --> 336.88
making it

334.479 --> 339.84
slightly less painful even just for a

336.88 --> 341.12
few moments

339.84 --> 345.44
uh

341.12 --> 347.52
right also still got blueberries

345.44 --> 352.6
they seem to work too a bit

347.52 --> 352.59999999999997
as long as i don't chew on that side

355.199 --> 360.639
so i'm just really taking it easy i went

357.36 --> 360.639
to bed really early

361.68 --> 365.36
but yeah

362.8 --> 368.319
late half awake

365.36 --> 368.319
the entire night

368.8 --> 373.759
like the only my body did get some rest

371.199 --> 375.91900000000004
however just from the like burst of

373.759 --> 378.47900000000004
euphoria in response to the pain it's

375.919 --> 380.71999999999997
weird how that works

378.479 --> 383.199
but yeah my mind's not exactly well

380.72 --> 383.199
rested

388.96 --> 392.71999999999997
right

390.56 --> 394.88
anyway i hope you guys aren't having

392.72 --> 396.24
such issues right now

394.88 --> 398.71999999999997
for me it

396.24 --> 400.16
in my memory it does typically happen

398.72 --> 403.91900000000004
during like

400.16 --> 403.91900000000004
when the spring really starts to

405.759 --> 408.759
go

409.759 --> 413.68
like

410.639 --> 415.52
during april or early may

413.68 --> 417.599
if i remember correctly i don't know if

415.52 --> 419.12
any of you remember but it does

417.599 --> 420.96
typically happen

419.12 --> 423.84000000000003
and i always like to forget that it

420.96 --> 423.84
happens

428.639 --> 432.8
i'm talking to my dad on the phone a bit

430.639 --> 434.96000000000004
and he says like yeah you could do like

432.8 --> 437.44
a root canal

434.96 --> 439.68
maybe that would happen yeah but maybe

437.44 --> 441.919
it it wouldn't right

439.68 --> 443.84000000000003
maybe if you go for that the dentist

441.919 --> 445.68
would be like oh [ __ ] this is not gonna

443.84 --> 448.08
work that it has to come out and then i

445.68 --> 449.36
got this giant hole in my

448.08 --> 452.24
teeth

449.36 --> 454.08000000000004
that i'm gonna have to live with

452.24 --> 457.44
so i'm just gonna trust it's gonna go

454.08 --> 457.44
away again like usual

458.88 --> 463.319
sit through a bit of a painful period

465.599 --> 467.919
right

469.039 --> 472.8
hello

469.919 --> 472.79999999999995
even my [ __ ]

476.0 --> 479.479
get out of here

481.52 --> 485.75899999999996
only when the swelling goes down yeah

483.039 --> 488.479
but the swelling it's not like it's like

485.759 --> 489.36
super it's like

488.479 --> 490.84
in

489.36 --> 494.24
the bone

490.84 --> 497.11999999999995
there it's basically directly

494.24 --> 498.879
connected to like my my nose

497.12 --> 501.12
what is it the mucous membrane over

498.879 --> 503.12
there so it probably has to do with that

501.12 --> 506.0
which is typical

503.12 --> 508.72
because that makes sense

506.0 --> 510.879
that it would be slight hay fever

508.72 --> 513.549
typically associated with mei that would

510.879 --> 515.6800000000001
make this happen every time right

513.549 --> 518.24
[Music]

515.68 --> 521.2399999999999
hello the other andrew

518.24 --> 521.24
terret306

523.519 --> 527.36
right but yeah

525.44 --> 529.2790000000001
i'm going to assume that last night was

527.36 --> 531.04
the worst

529.279 --> 534.04
it does feel better than it did last

531.04 --> 534.04
night

537.519 --> 541.68
right but i don't want to just talk

539.12 --> 541.68
about that

541.92 --> 546.519
and and i'm gonna keep the show short

550.0 --> 554.08
yeah thanks other andrew yeah i've been

552.0 --> 556.64
thr dude i go through this pretty much

554.08 --> 556.64
every year

557.519 --> 563.839
it's one of those things

559.44 --> 563.839
about my cycle that i like to forget

567.2 --> 573.279
right also it's been like really

570.48 --> 576.519
in the way of my eating because i'm just

573.279 --> 576.519
not hungry

576.72 --> 582.0
well at the thing the thing is i am

578.64 --> 585.519
hungry it's just that it's not working

582.0 --> 590.279
like i feel like i can't really eat

585.519 --> 590.279
just eating a couple of berries and

591.83 --> 596.72
[Music]

593.92 --> 598.959
smoking some can cannabis like stuff

596.72 --> 600.9590000000001
does help a bit

598.959 --> 603.5189999999999
it's rather just a distraction and i

600.959 --> 606.88
don't know the cannabinoids should help

603.519 --> 608.48
like the healing process a bit

606.88 --> 611.76
fasting today

608.48 --> 611.76
all right terra 306

613.76 --> 616.76
wow

618.0 --> 621.839
huh

618.8 --> 624.0
seems like it's already migrated

621.839 --> 626.0
because i really yeah sorry to get so

624.0 --> 629.6
visceral about it

626.0 --> 629.6
one of the reasons i don't want to

630.079 --> 634.0
talk about it all the time i don't want

631.92 --> 635.5999999999999
you to start thinking about it and then

634.0 --> 637.519
maybe

635.6 --> 639.2
get that

637.519 --> 641.12
but it's really like there's this

639.2 --> 643.36
pressure bubble

641.12 --> 644.16
that i just experienced somewhere in

643.36 --> 647.36
there

644.16 --> 648.48
and it migrates like literally the place

647.36 --> 649.92
of it just

648.48 --> 652.0
changes

649.92 --> 653.5999999999999
slowly

652.0 --> 656.0
weird

653.6 --> 658.16
but it seems to be now in a position

656.0 --> 660.24
where it's not really pushing super hard

658.16 --> 663.4399999999999
on the nerve i'm very happy about that

660.24 --> 665.519
because that was quite unbearable

663.44 --> 666.5600000000001
uh

665.519 --> 668.8
hope that

666.56 --> 670.88
it stays that way i really hope that it

668.8 --> 672.88
was just this night

670.88 --> 674.48
god

672.88 --> 675.57
all right

674.48 --> 681.2090000000001
anyway

675.57 --> 681.2090000000001
[Music]

697.92 --> 702.4799999999999
now i just have to figure out what i'm

699.519 --> 704.16
actually going to eat

702.48 --> 706.24
later on in the day

704.16 --> 708.56
because i just don't want to be chewing

706.24 --> 708.5600000000001
stuff

710.8 --> 713.12
anyway

713.36 --> 719.6
flat earth debate was great yesterday

716.959 --> 722.2399999999999
i wasn't super active in it mostly just

719.6 --> 722.24
at the start

723.2 --> 726.72
i think that like my jaw was already

725.12 --> 729.44
kind of getting in the way

726.72 --> 731.0400000000001
in the daytime yesterday it's just that

729.44 --> 733.0400000000001
that sort of thing just typically comes

731.04 --> 735.68
and goes but then in the evening it went

733.04 --> 735.68
really bad

743.6 --> 747.839
yeah made by jim bob also had a really

745.68 --> 751.12
awesome stream again

747.839 --> 751.12
i really like his streams

752.51 --> 755.6899999999999
[Music]

757.04 --> 763.4399999999999
there's some new videos out there mitch

759.12 --> 763.44
from australia flat side

763.519 --> 766.5600000000001
and michael khan

768.639 --> 774.8
about anti-flat earthers and their weird

771.839 --> 777.44
double speaking about the sextant and

774.8 --> 779.1999999999999
triangulation and not using it but no

777.44 --> 779.9200000000001
they are using it but they're not using

779.2 --> 784.519
it

779.92 --> 784.519
so that's really the talk of the day

787.36 --> 790.36
ugh

802.72 --> 808.36
hello by the way jess palmer did i say

805.04 --> 808.36
hello already

825.6 --> 828.6800000000001
all right

830.399 --> 834.639
in a way just this experience is such a

832.639 --> 837.199
bummer because it's like

834.639 --> 839.199
it's full spring day now like if i want

837.199 --> 841.76
more focus i could just start talking

839.199 --> 844.16
about the birds like so many different

841.76 --> 844.16
birds

844.32 --> 850.32
that i bumped into out there and they're

846.56 --> 852.4799999999999
just chirping and surprised about how

850.32 --> 855.44
like a little bird like this can make

852.48 --> 857.6800000000001
such a noise that i almost had to kill

855.44 --> 862.0790000000001
cover my ears because it was so loud

857.68 --> 862.079
just such a tiny little bird is amazing

863.279 --> 868.72
also a lot of guys

865.68 --> 871.68
like at the at the water fishing

868.72 --> 872.88
and one guy was using just a fish of

871.68 --> 876.0
some kind

872.88 --> 878.959
to to like try to catch a carper

876.0 --> 882.839
and there was like it was biting it like

878.959 --> 885.199
fish it was this big like

882.839 --> 887.1990000000001
huge like holy [ __ ]

885.199 --> 889.12
that's in there

887.199 --> 891.92
dude better not keep your dick hanging

889.12 --> 891.92
out man

892.48 --> 896.8000000000001
if you know what i mean

894.16 --> 896.8
in the water

897.04 --> 901.519
huge garbers

900.0 --> 905.04
i don't know if they're carpets in

901.519 --> 908.839
english it's like this huge

905.04 --> 908.8389999999999
robber baron fish

912.639 --> 918.0790000000001
oh yeah i also saw a stock

915.36 --> 918.0790000000001
is that a stock

920.16 --> 926.199
i had like my own mini nature

922.079 --> 926.199
documentary let's see

926.639 --> 931.839
a heron yeah i saw a heron like at the

929.44 --> 934.8000000000001
side of the water too

931.839 --> 937.44
and i actually saw it

934.8 --> 938.8
catch a fish was amazing

937.44 --> 940.639
also because

938.8 --> 943.04
it would like

940.639 --> 945.44
it has like a head with it

943.04 --> 948.079
with the beak and then like this weird

945.44 --> 950.0790000000001
curly almost swan like neck

948.079 --> 952.8
and i just noticed like how it was doing

950.079 --> 955.519
that and at the last second right before

952.8 --> 956.639
it was gonna strike it tensed up

955.519 --> 960.0
and started

956.639 --> 962.16
whirling and moving exactly like a cat

960.0 --> 963.839
does right before it strikes and it was

962.16 --> 966.8
pretty remarkable

963.839 --> 968.8000000000001
and it did catch the little fishy

966.8 --> 971.7589999999999
i just really noticed that

968.8 --> 971.7589999999999
like oh it's like

971.92 --> 975.04
and then it caught the fish

973.92 --> 977.12
it's funny

975.04 --> 979.519
the movement was just like

977.12 --> 981.199
like a cat does right before it's gonna

979.519 --> 983.839
jump at something

981.199 --> 986.959
remarkable the bird just has the excite

983.839 --> 986.9590000000001
the same mechanics

989.12 --> 992.079
right so yeah nature's flourishing out

991.279 --> 996.6
there

992.079 --> 996.5999999999999

i did actually ask those types of

1485.12 --> 1487.84
questions in school

1488.64 --> 1493.679
but the teachers

1491.039 --> 1494.799
were very smart they were like aware

1493.679 --> 1496.64
about that

1494.799 --> 1498.72
and they even like communicated me

1496.64 --> 1500.64
one-on-one outside the class like that

1498.72 --> 1503.64
they're not supposed to talk about those

1500.64 --> 1503.64
things

1515.279 --> 1518.279
okay

1530.08 --> 1533.4399999999998
hey seeking star water

right third body problem but yeah but

1541.279 --> 1545.76
they knew that right when i got taught

1543.6 --> 1548.0
gravity in school and even got a couple

1545.76 --> 1550.08
of hints about einsteining ground they

1548.0 --> 1551.919
taught us that and they taught us the

1550.08 --> 1553.6
problem with it they basically presented

1551.919 --> 1556.96
it like

1553.6 --> 1559.4399999999998
yeah it's complicated

1556.96 --> 1561.44
right but you're supposed to learn it

1559.44 --> 1563.1200000000001
like this

1561.44 --> 1566.559
but yeah don't

1563.12 --> 1568.9599999999998
it's just a it's just a test it's just

1566.559 --> 1571.12
temporary

1568.96 --> 1573.919
but yeah they did

1571.12 --> 1575.4399999999998
they were aware about like the whole

1573.919 --> 1576.4
third body

1575.44 --> 1579.2
issue

1576.4 --> 1580.96

einsteinian gravity

1580.96 --> 1584.8400000000001
