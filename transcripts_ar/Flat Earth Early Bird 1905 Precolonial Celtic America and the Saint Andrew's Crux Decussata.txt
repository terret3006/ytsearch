the support so please keep it coming

104.159 --> 107.43900000000001
quite frankly I could really use a

105.96 --> 110.52
PayPal support

107.439 --> 112.24
today a lot I'm going to be asking for

110.52 --> 117.0
it a couple of

112.24 --> 118.83999999999999
times anyway whether today is yeah not

117.0 --> 123.399
what it was

118.84 --> 125.68
yesterday uh turned into a big gray

123.399 --> 129.88
soup up

125.68 --> 129.88
there quite the contrast with

133.56 --> 140.959
yesterday it's

136.76 --> 143.92
uh it's not windy either so it's like

140.959 --> 148.56
totally different yesterday yesterday

143.92 --> 153.67999999999998
big clouds Blue Sky Sun some wind some

148.56 --> 157.64000000000001
heavy rain today no wind big gray

153.68 --> 162.04000000000002
soup no rain no sun

157.64 --> 165.2
okay I am spotting however that one of

162.04 --> 168.159
the trees down there is starting to show

165.2 --> 171.04
some pink Blossom so it's already

168.159 --> 171.04
starting with that

172.879 --> 177.35999999999999
one it's going to be quite the

178.84 --> 181.84
spectacle

182.12 --> 189.959
all right so hello Jad first in chat

185.92 --> 196.319
good to see you the bable

189.959 --> 196.31900000000002
D yeah I I could have been off but I

196.959 --> 201.48
uh things like went a bit

201.519 --> 207.68
weird with the welfare thing so it's

204.76 --> 207.67999999999998
like it's

208.04 --> 216.56
late some misom communication

212.319 --> 219.72
unfortunately uh and I can really really

216.56 --> 222.12
use the support right now

219.72 --> 227.239
cuz basically I'm

222.12 --> 227.239
broke and I'm almost clean out of

229.879 --> 234.879
food to be fair I am pretty much clean

232.879 --> 237.599
out of food don't have any Illuminati

234.879 --> 237.599
croissant for

238.4 --> 244.59900000000002
today so if anybody could that's

242.519 --> 249.04
watching this that likes my activities

244.599 --> 253.39999999999998
here could assist me through a PayPal

249.04 --> 253.4
donation that would be enormously

254.4 --> 261.04
appreciated so uh yeah I'll be asking

256.959 --> 267.0
for that a couple of times today right

261.04 --> 267.0
anyhow it is Tuesday the 26th of March

268.72 --> 271.72
2024

273.639 --> 278.16
temperature is 10°

278.88 --> 284.84
C H other place apparently other places

282.8 --> 285.88
in the Netherlands is 14 but over here

284.84 --> 287.919
it's

285.88 --> 292.88
10

287.919 --> 292.88
okay 64% humidity

294.16 --> 301.52000000000004
H right anyway yeah I got another

298.639 --> 305.68
title

301.52 --> 308.639
been following up looking into

305.68 --> 312.88
this St Andrews

308.639 --> 317.36
cross and the uh of course the N eclipse

312.88 --> 317.36
coming and found a whole bunch of

324.12 --> 331.199
stuff right yeah debatable D I wasn't

326.84 --> 334.15999999999997
expecting from you

331.199 --> 335.88
but uh yeah anybody else that is capable

334.16 --> 339.12
of donating

335.88 --> 342.319
like 10 bucks 20 bucks or more that

339.12 --> 342.319
would be absolutely

343.08 --> 348.52
fantastic then I can like secure my food

346.08 --> 351.479
at least for the next coming

348.52 --> 353.71999999999997
days any more donations would be even

351.479 --> 356.68
more welcome then I could stock up on

353.72 --> 356.68
some other things as

356.919 --> 361.4
well like new tobacco which I'm running

360.44 --> 365.039
out

361.4 --> 368.08
of right but yeah food definitely has

365.039 --> 370.15999999999997
priority and I guess I'll take this

368.08 --> 372.44
broke period is

370.16 --> 375.28000000000003
a very

372.44 --> 378.84
ironic forced fasting that I've been

375.28 --> 381.039
recommending everybody to do so I'll be

378.84 --> 382.84
just eating a bit less

381.039 --> 386.24
today

382.84 --> 388.75899999999996
probably at least

386.24 --> 391.0
now just a shame because I was really

388.759 --> 394.36
looking forward to an Illuminati croon

391.0 --> 396.72
but yeah I mean if you can't afford it

394.36 --> 400.36
it's not going to

396.72 --> 400.36
happen right

401.12 --> 408.12
anyway precolonial C Celtic America and

405.12 --> 411.599
St Andrew Cru

408.12 --> 411.599
deata that's the

412.319 --> 417.47900000000004
title expanding more on the

415.84 --> 420.44
[Music]

417.479 --> 423.12
whole theme that I've been

420.44 --> 425.68
fulfilled with filled up with in the

423.12 --> 425.68
last

426.36 --> 434.639
week and just doing a Google

430.4 --> 437.71999999999997
search on the St Andrews cross it's been

434.639 --> 440.639
very interesting this this whole thing

437.72 --> 444.16
with Apostle

440.639 --> 447.84000000000003
Andrew that he apparently got crucified

444.16 --> 450.36
but he requested it to be an X Type

447.84 --> 453.28
cross because he didn't think he was

450.36 --> 455.28000000000003
worthy enough to hang on the same type

453.28 --> 457.15999999999997
of cross as Jesus

455.28 --> 463.65999999999997
Christ and that

457.16 --> 465.0
is yeah part of where that concept comes

463.66 --> 468.72
[Music]

465.0 --> 470.919
from and St Andrews is is an interesting

468.72 --> 474.28000000000003
figure also

470.919 --> 476.35999999999996
historically he did seem to have gone

474.28 --> 481.44
all over the

476.36 --> 481.44
place including to Kev

484.759 --> 489.84000000000003
and apparently made a prophecy there I

487.0 --> 491.639
haven't really look deeper into it but

489.84 --> 495.44
that just stood out a

491.639 --> 502.039
bit also another

495.44 --> 502.039
correlation is that within the runes

503.479 --> 513.8
system the X also known as gibo or gefu

509.919 --> 516.64
is is a symbol very specific symbol that

513.8 --> 520.3199999999999
was always by me at least

516.64 --> 520.3199999999999
Associated as a good

520.56 --> 526.04
symbol basically means gift within the

523.519 --> 528.8
Run language which is all just very

526.04 --> 528.8
fascinating to

530.48 --> 537.36
me right hello Lou Alcott good to see

533.8 --> 537.3599999999999
you a man goeth good to see

537.8 --> 546.279
you requested to the crucified upside no

541.36 --> 546.279
that that is uh that's another

546.72 --> 554.5600000000001
one wasn't

549.279 --> 554.56
that uh hello clutch good to see

561.68 --> 568.8
you was it Peter

566.0 --> 571.36
right upside down yeah they all had

568.8 --> 571.3599999999999
their own

571.64 --> 575.8389999999999
weird thing with

573.04 --> 578.68
that but yeah St Andrew I've never

575.839 --> 582.6400000000001
really even heard of him

578.68 --> 586.399
before never or it never really

582.64 --> 587.72
crossed my attention before so it's all

586.399 --> 590.88
just

587.72 --> 593.12
like suddenly showing up in my attention

590.88 --> 593.12
like

594.279 --> 600.68
that and it is

596.64 --> 603.16
a a bit inspiring

600.68 --> 605.88
although I am not

603.16 --> 609.4399999999999
certain I have my

605.88 --> 612.88
doubts about the whole thing in a way

609.44 --> 612.8800000000001
but then again I

612.959 --> 618.279
shouldn't signs are there I just have a

615.92 --> 622.76
lot of suspicions I have this

618.279 --> 622.76
curiosity especially towards the

622.959 --> 629.4799999999999
Confederacy and potential occulted

626.2 --> 633.0
knowledge that they may have had I'm

629.48 --> 633.0
really curious about

633.68 --> 639.8
that actually hoping some of you might

636.2 --> 639.8000000000001
have found out something about

641.88 --> 644.88
that

658.24 --> 661.24
right

673.72 --> 677.6
let me just look for a moment into

678.24 --> 684.2
the red zil Chronicle which is the one

683.04 --> 687.1999999999999
that

684.2 --> 691.44
recorded or the conings be

687.2 --> 693.639
Chronicle old East Slavic illuminated

691.44 --> 696.9590000000001
manuscript from the 15th

693.639 --> 699.519
century a copy of a 13th century

696.959 --> 699.5189999999999
original

706.519 --> 710.9590000000001
manuscript which is currently resting in

708.92 --> 714.04
the library of Russian Academy of

710.959 --> 714.04
Sciences in St

717.32 --> 721.24
Petersburg tells the history

722.76 --> 726.76
of of KF

727.079 --> 730.56
basically a lot of

731.48 --> 734.76
illustrations let's

748.16 --> 751.16
see

778.76 --> 782.6
profess see of the rise of

784.6 --> 791.44
GIF and apparently like

788.519 --> 795.32
the what is it the Special

791.44 --> 797.9200000000001
cross I think that's the Orthodox

795.32 --> 797.9200000000001
Christian

798.92 --> 804.04
cross is also visible on that I I

802.519 --> 806.399
basically have one

804.04 --> 811.12
depiction I'm bit disappointed that

806.399 --> 811.12
there wasn't more detail

814.519 --> 820.68
that I could find about it let me just

818.16 --> 820.68
share the

830.279 --> 834.68
depiction all right that this is

834.72 --> 842.399
it yeah I can't read that but St Andre

839.399 --> 842.399
apparently went to

846.839 --> 854.72
KF I thought that was kind of

849.48 --> 854.72
interesting regarding well the overall

856.0 --> 860.759
circumstances it might all just be

858.0 --> 860.759
correlation

866.079 --> 871.04
though didn't I get money on Friday

871.38 --> 874.5
[Music]

875.12 --> 878.12
uh

884.519 --> 887.519
no

897.24 --> 905.04
right yeah also apparent currently the

900.16 --> 908.92
the diagonal cross is called a Sal Tire

905.04 --> 911.8389999999999
saltier very interesting like never knew

908.92 --> 914.959
that such a simple symbol could have so

911.839 --> 920.759
many references and

914.959 --> 920.7589999999999
names like the x is apparently called a

927.959 --> 930.959
saltire

934.47 --> 937.519
[Music]

941.44 --> 945.639
right anyway let me give you some of

943.399 --> 945.639
those

957.0 --> 960.92
links take a look for itself

986.519 --> 994.9590000000001
all right cell tire was apparently also

988.6 --> 994.9590000000001
used in the Russian Navy it's just all

996.16 --> 1000.8389999999999
interesting interesting correlations

1017.839 --> 1020.839
perhaps

1033.16 --> 1040.679
right and used across the

1036.439 --> 1044.039
Americas so there's definitely like in a

1040.679 --> 1046.3190000000002
way a Celtic Connection in my opinion

1044.039 --> 1046.319
like

1047.84 --> 1050.84
that

1052.6 --> 1057.6789999999999
and I've been

1053.919 --> 1061.1200000000001
wondering in conspiratorial

1057.679 --> 1064.5590000000002
fashion is there something there

1061.12 --> 1065.76
like other than the reference the

1064.559 --> 1068.559
biblical

1065.76 --> 1072.64
reference is

1068.559 --> 1076.16
there where did that cross come from why

1072.64 --> 1076.16
is it across all these

1076.28 --> 1085.44
nations I've been thinking what

1080.72 --> 1088.84
if in precolonial times in

1085.44 --> 1091.3600000000001
America there have been people out there

1088.84 --> 1094.84
that have said like yeah the the Kels

1091.36 --> 1098.4799999999998
were like potentially part of tartaria

1094.84 --> 1100.6399999999999
been across the world like much more

1098.48 --> 1104.0
widespread and

1100.64 --> 1107.88
maybe they did

1104.0 --> 1109.64
actually live on a big part of the

1107.88 --> 1112.2800000000002
United States

1109.64 --> 1115.24
especially the central

1112.28 --> 1118.32
regions before colonialism basically

1115.24 --> 1119.88
happened and was all denied

1118.32 --> 1122.32
and

1119.88 --> 1125.679
recolonized by

1122.32 --> 1125.6789999999999
Europe well

1126.4 --> 1130.64
then that symbol might have originally

1129.679 --> 1132.98
been

1130.64 --> 1135.039
derived from the

1132.98 --> 1138.039
[Music]

1135.039 --> 1139.24
reoccurring cross shaped eclipse and

1138.039 --> 1143.48
that is exactly

1139.24 --> 1144.88
because that the x that is made by the

1143.48 --> 1148.84
by

1144.88 --> 1152.919
these celestial events these solar

1148.84 --> 1152.9189999999999
eclipses is like

1155.52 --> 1162.1589999999999
remarkably like the shape of an x on a

1158.679 --> 1167.72
typical flag it's not like a a

1162.159 --> 1170.72
perfect plus 45 degrees turned no it's

1167.72 --> 1173.96
slightly

1170.72 --> 1177.3600000000001
like in a rectangular shape as would

1173.96 --> 1180.44
typically it would appear in the flags

1177.36 --> 1183.559
so I was thinking what if the Kelts

1180.44 --> 1186.28
originally figure that out through these

1183.559 --> 1186.28
reoccurring

1186.72 --> 1193.96
eclipses and took it as a big sign

1189.76 --> 1197.44
enough for them to actually use it in

1193.96 --> 1200.64
heraldry and well there I say graft it

1197.44 --> 1200.64
into biblical Legend

1200.96 --> 1208.1200000000001
with St

1203.4 --> 1213.2
Andrews or maybe St Andrews was even

1208.12 --> 1213.1999999999998
aware of it way

1214.64 --> 1220.1200000000001
back and used his crucifixion as an

1218.08 --> 1223.1999999999998
opportunity to

1220.12 --> 1227.799
emphasize that

1223.2 --> 1230.76
symbol AS like an astrological marker to

1227.799 --> 1233.039
esoterically place that within the Bible

1230.76 --> 1237.36
it's yeah it

1233.039 --> 1237.36
just lots of ideas and

1244.82 --> 1247.96
[Music]

1249.4 --> 1255.52
Inspirations okay let's

1251.679 --> 1255.52
see a level with

1257.6 --> 1260.6
me

1269.679 --> 1276.44
okay a lot of don't bump into a lot of

1272.4 --> 1276.44
people that actually name themselves

1277.88 --> 1281.8400000000001
retardo that's something I

1287.52 --> 1292.32
guess

1289.159 --> 1292.3200000000002
centered over the

1298.36 --> 1301.9189999999999
noncon I have no

1302.08 --> 1308.6789999999999
idea I don't yeah it's not like the

1305.679 --> 1308.679
Confederates

1309.84 --> 1316.12
necessarily would have been like yeah we

1312.24 --> 1318.6
need to occupy the A on

1316.12 --> 1320.76
America although maybe they did attack

1318.6 --> 1323.76
attempted and maybe that was foiled I

1320.76 --> 1326.08
mean officially they lost the Civil War

1323.76 --> 1326.08
didn't

1328.48 --> 1335.0
they maybe the north anticipated this

1332.159 --> 1339.44
kind of occult

1335.0 --> 1342.24
based wish this ult based ambition and

1339.44 --> 1344.48
they foil it

1342.24 --> 1347.52
specifically and that that is why

1344.48 --> 1350.52
Illinois is not a Confederate State who

1347.52 --> 1350.52
knows

1358.36 --> 1365.4799999999998
what is going to cause the solar

1361.48 --> 1368.48
eclipse what is going to cause the solar

1365.48 --> 1368.48
eclipse

1370.76 --> 1376.0
ah the cyclical nature of the celestial

1377.44 --> 1382.4
lights

1379.96 --> 1384.919
I mean we we don't really know what it

1382.4 --> 1387.1200000000001
is like

1384.919 --> 1389.3200000000002
physically so if you don't really know

1387.12 --> 1392.76
what it is physically then how could you

1389.32 --> 1392.76
ever really determined the

1396.2 --> 1402.64
cause or am I referring to the first

1399.24 --> 1405.279
second and third I don't

1402.64 --> 1408.3200000000002
know I'm referring to the one that has a

1405.279 --> 1412.799
cross over it with the Stars in it is

1408.32 --> 1412.799
the the most widely known

1423.52 --> 1428.48
flag yeah there is also a square flag I

1426.679 --> 1432.159
have seen

1428.48 --> 1432.159
that that one has a

1432.6 --> 1440.4399999999998
90° right the North Virginia Army of

1436.24 --> 1440.44
General Lee right

1445.64 --> 1453.64
is quite unusual by the way cuz it's

1449.08 --> 1458.24
very it's unusual that flags are squared

1453.64 --> 1458.24
entirely most of them are

1467.36 --> 1470.36
rectangular

1473.039 --> 1477.72
Chicago Bears what what are you talking

1486.84 --> 1494.039
about fun with lags episode oh my God is

1491.12 --> 1494.039
that a reference

1497.32 --> 1503.24
to

1500.24 --> 1506.24
to The Big Bang

1503.24 --> 1509.52
Theory

1506.24 --> 1512.88
H yeah no but it's not going to be a fun

1509.52 --> 1512.8799999999999
with flags episode

1523.6 --> 1529.8799999999999
thanks uh let's

1526.96 --> 1533.3990000000001
see I I think did show the the one

1529.88 --> 1533.3990000000001
specific flag that I

1542.12 --> 1545.1699999999998
[Music]

1553.52 --> 1557.24
Associated just talking about the the

1556.159 --> 1560.24
classic

1557.24 --> 1560.24
one

1560.679 --> 1565.2
Modern Display of the Confederate Battle

1587.24 --> 1590.24
Flag

1591.399 --> 1593.6
this

1612.08 --> 1620.6399999999999
one right cuz that

1615.919 --> 1624.2
is well that just really is the shape of

1620.64 --> 1626.64
the specific Eclipse path over the

1624.2 --> 1626.64
United

1633.08 --> 1642.52
States the second stripe is going to be

1636.559 --> 1642.52
put down by the solar eclipse the 8th of

1647.159 --> 1650.159
April

1654.63 --> 1657.739
[Music]

1665.88 --> 1669.919
right yeah the colors I

1670.44 --> 1677.1200000000001
know and like the cross has an umbra and

1675.2 --> 1680.1200000000001
penumbra I

1677.12 --> 1680.12
mean

1680.279 --> 1688.12
blue and the white lines around it I

1684.039 --> 1691.96
mean o it's just I mean the the

1688.12 --> 1691.9599999999998
correlations are off the

1692.64 --> 1699.44
chart and that's what's been like

1695.88 --> 1701.44
buzzing me recently although I haven't

1699.44 --> 1704.279
my biggest disappointment is that I

1701.44 --> 1706.2
haven't really found any

1704.279 --> 1710.559
serious

1706.2 --> 1712.72
occultic predictions or or prophecies or

1710.559 --> 1714.48
anything like that from the Confederacy

1712.72 --> 1716.96
and that is kind of what I had hoped to

1714.48 --> 1716.96
stumble

1726.42 --> 1729.989
[Music]

1731.12 --> 1737.32
upon yeah debatable D they do they

1734.36 --> 1740.039
absolutely do make that shape of the

1737.32 --> 1740.039
cross

1741.799 --> 1748.519
don't know why you always have to be

1743.44 --> 1748.519
such a n with this [ __ ] but it

1753.72 --> 1761.24
does uh try to find

1757.96 --> 1761.24
back the

1763.08 --> 1768.559
image somebody did

1767.039 --> 1773.559
post

1768.559 --> 1773.559
an image of the eclipse path and it's

1773.679 --> 1780.2
exactly exactly that cross try to find

1777.44 --> 1780.2
in where the is

1786.399 --> 1791.9189999999999
it damn it so much so much

1797.039 --> 1800.039
spam

1801.36 --> 1806.279
she

1803.559 --> 1811.399
where God how

1806.279 --> 1815.279
much post do these guys make this is

1811.399 --> 1815.279
nuts bunch of cats and

1815.559 --> 1818.9189999999999
dogs where is

1826.96 --> 1829.96
it

1851.76 --> 1854.08
damn

1856.919 --> 1859.919
it

1881.72 --> 1885.88
I can't find it this is kind of

1886.919 --> 1889.919
disappointing

1895.159 --> 1900.8400000000001
you don't use PayPal do any payments

1899.2 --> 1903.3990000000001
forms

1900.84 --> 1906.639
online uh

1903.399 --> 1909.5189999999998
no I got a patreon too but I mean PayPal

1906.639 --> 1912.24
is really is the best option it's the

1909.519 --> 1912.24
most the

1913.36 --> 1918.84
quickest if you really want to donate i'

1916.12 --> 1920.1589999999999
I'd like you to reconsider signing up

1918.84 --> 1922.9189999999999
with

1920.159 --> 1926.279
PayPal cuz it really does work the best

1922.919 --> 1929.24
for me and there's other payment systems

1926.279 --> 1932.279
and all that but most of them are United

1929.24 --> 1937.679
States only so that doesn't work with

1932.279 --> 1937.679
me L alol appreciate the gesture

1939.48 --> 1945.919
though Switzerland has a square flag huh

1943.679 --> 1945.919
that's

1946.84 --> 1949.84
odd

1965.8 --> 1968.9099999999999
[Music]

1975.6 --> 1979.84
see right yeah here it go

1980.44 --> 1990.1200000000001
goes NASA science this is

1985.159 --> 1990.1200000000001
hilarious uh let me find this

2006.32 --> 2012.039
one yeah I'm I can't believe I'm I'm

2008.96 --> 2012.039
pulling this from the

2012.08 --> 2018.1999999999998
NASA

2013.76 --> 2021.399
science. nasa.gov site but I mean hey

2018.2 --> 2021.3990000000001
they got the picture

2021.799 --> 2026.1589999999999
so but this shows that

2029.799 --> 2035.8799999999999
path right so this is the

2032.96 --> 2038.799
path now let's compare that with the

2035.88 --> 2043.2
Confederate rebel flag

2038.799 --> 2043.2
just look at how the the x

2044.2 --> 2049.0
is that's exactly the same type of

2054.079 --> 2057.079
X

2060.079 --> 2066.52
see I got it

2062.52 --> 2066.52
from science.nasa.gov

2070.119 --> 2072.32
all

2096.64 --> 2099.64
right

2126.64 --> 2129.64
e

2156.64 --> 2159.64
e

2186.56 --> 2189.56
e

2216.52 --> 2219.52
e

2225.599 --> 2228.56
all right sorry about

2231.119 --> 2237.56
that uh damn it that wasn't you're not

2234.839 --> 2239.839
supposed to be looking at my freaking

2237.56 --> 2242.7999999999997
emails

2239.839 --> 2246.52
whatever trusting in NASA today no I'm

2242.8 --> 2249.52
not trusting in NASA but I'm just using

2246.52 --> 2249.52
them

2251.72 --> 2255.16
to reference the eclipse

2256.92 --> 2259.92
path

2276.44 --> 2279.44
right

2283.48 --> 2289.64
are you are basing a confederal

2286.16 --> 2289.64
Revolution what are you talking

2293.119 --> 2300.28
about St Andrews crosses like two

2296.68 --> 2300.2799999999997
Chemtrails all righty

2306.44 --> 2309.44
then

2313.4 --> 2321.04
Scottish referendum leaving the UK

2316.079 --> 2324.079
interesting right well look as I

2321.04 --> 2327.56
said again the

2324.079 --> 2330.76
whole Eclipse thing it might simply be

2327.56 --> 2334.44
an energy thing there is

2330.76 --> 2336.44
energy and it's not like directly caused

2334.44 --> 2338.4
by the eclipse

2336.44 --> 2341.56
it's

2338.4 --> 2344.319
like a persistent correlation like we

2341.56 --> 2347.4
don't know what the eclipse literally is

2344.319 --> 2351.079
except for a Celestial

2347.4 --> 2353.2000000000003
event but there is energies and this is

2351.079 --> 2356.6400000000003
like what the Ancients believe to the

2353.2 --> 2358.7599999999998
astrologers like celestial events come

2356.64 --> 2361.68
with

2358.76 --> 2363.599
energy some might call that real energy

2361.68 --> 2365.319
somebody called it that yesterday when I

2363.599 --> 2368.839
brought it

2365.319 --> 2371.839
up that there is an energy Unleashed

2368.839 --> 2374.48
upon men like they can feel that

2371.839 --> 2376.24
especially if you're like bit of an

2374.48 --> 2379.92
occultist

2376.24 --> 2383.24
or spiritual person sensitive to those

2379.92 --> 2384.88
kinds of things and there is that energy

2383.24 --> 2390.4799999999996
that is

2384.88 --> 2395.359
like marked it's marked down and

2390.48 --> 2397.92
so the second part of the cross a St

2395.359 --> 2401.0789999999997
Andrews cross that's being draw drawn

2397.92 --> 2404.839
over the United States might be the

2401.079 --> 2406.6400000000003
completion of that symbol might

2404.839 --> 2408.64
be

2406.64 --> 2411.1189999999997
astrologically

2408.64 --> 2414.56
energetically causing a whole bunch of

2411.119 --> 2418.52
effects on those that are linked up to

2414.56 --> 2420.04
it which may include Scotland and

2418.52 --> 2423.52
Ireland

2420.04 --> 2426.56
and some other places too

2423.52 --> 2429.24
perhaps and in the United States more

2426.56 --> 2432.92
specifically the Confederacy so it's

2429.24 --> 2434.9599999999996
like these are like Signs like

2432.92 --> 2437.96
astrological signs like there's

2434.96 --> 2442.48
something going to happen and that's why

2437.96 --> 2445.16
I've been like just going nuts over

2442.48 --> 2446.599
it like whoa something's going to happen

2445.16 --> 2449.92
something's going to happen it's like my

2446.599 --> 2452.2000000000003
shamanic senses are going off the charts

2449.92 --> 2452.2000000000003
with

2453.0 --> 2457.92
this and I wish I had

2456.24 --> 2461.1189999999997
more

2457.92 --> 2462.64
material in relation to it to those

2461.119 --> 2467.6400000000003
subjects

2462.64 --> 2471.48
to like yeah Confederacy and St Andrews

2467.64 --> 2475.04
cross symbol and in the flag had more

2471.48 --> 2476.57
research on that and on how occultists

2475.04 --> 2477.88
would

2476.57 --> 2480.319
[Music]

2477.88 --> 2483.28
have perhaps

2480.319 --> 2486.24
referenced this reoccurring Celestial

2483.28 --> 2489.2000000000003
event in some way maybe said like this

2486.24 --> 2493.4399999999996
is of significance maybe we need to plan

2489.2 --> 2497.1189999999997
to do certain things around these times

2493.44 --> 2500.16
because that's the time when we get

2497.119 --> 2503.48
power to actually

2500.16 --> 2506.52
manifest dominance or

2503.48 --> 2509.28
establish self self reliancy or that

2506.52 --> 2512.96
kind of thing and I was hoping to find

2509.28 --> 2515.76
more of that and that's why I'm also

2512.96 --> 2518.359
ahead of time telling you guys out there

2515.76 --> 2522.4
and then maybe hopefully some of you can

2518.359 --> 2524.7999999999997
dig something up that'll give me more

2522.4 --> 2526.7400000000002
hints to try to understand the

2524.8 --> 2531.52
significance of it

2526.74 --> 2535.3999999999996
[Music]

2531.52 --> 2538.47
all right but it does certainly give me

2535.4 --> 2545.44
hope of a

2538.47 --> 2545.4399999999996
[Music]

2546.119 --> 2551.079
transformation

2548.24 --> 2552.319
right an interesting debatable D that

2551.079 --> 2555.76
yeah maybe

2552.319 --> 2559.119
Scottish referendum leaving the UK and I

2555.76 --> 2559.119
mean why wouldn't they at this

2560.04 --> 2566.119
point cuz it's all been terrible like

2563.599 --> 2570.48
everything that the the crown has been

2566.119 --> 2574.4300000000003
doing in England to yeah to Ireland and

2570.48 --> 2576.119
Scotland its influences have been

2574.43 --> 2579.1189999999997
[Music]

2576.119 --> 2579.119
terrible

2580.559 --> 2583.88
so perhaps in that sense you could

2582.24 --> 2587.0789999999997
almost say it's like

2583.88 --> 2589.88
the perhaps the

2587.079 --> 2593.1600000000003
end of a

2589.88 --> 2594.8
cycle well that's what the Phoenix

2593.16 --> 2596.92
symbolizes

2594.8 --> 2600.3590000000004
anyhow

2596.92 --> 2603.839
right the it's the completion the end of

2600.359 --> 2603.839
a cycle death and

2605.04 --> 2610.68
rebirth Scots can rejoin join the EU o

2608.599 --> 2613.3590000000004
wow don't know if that's really all that

2610.68 --> 2613.359
much better

2619.92 --> 2623.2000000000003
but we'll

2623.359 --> 2629.2799999999997
see all right

2626.44 --> 2634.7200000000003
anyway hope you guys are

2629.28 --> 2634.7200000000003
uh your Curiosity has been

2636.04 --> 2640.22
titillated

2638.0 --> 2651.09

2652.24 --> 2656.4799999999996
what did somebody send me a

2657.68 --> 2663.839
PayPal I really hope so I can really

2661.28 --> 2663.8390000000004
really use

2666.04 --> 2670.649
it

what what do you mean May or

2797.64 --> 2803.69
October they don't know which

2801.44 --> 2809.13
one that's a bit

2803.69 --> 2809.13
[Music]

2815.28 --> 2818.8390000000004
weird all right

2818.92 --> 2822.599
but anyhow let me lay it down

2824.599 --> 2833.76
again the whole uh n Eclipse situation

2830.0 --> 2833.76
doesn't mean that like upon the

2834.25 --> 2840.839
[Music]

2836.64 --> 2843.4
moment yeah it's taking it as a

2840.839 --> 2846.0
gift

2843.4 --> 2848.2400000000002
yeah but uh since you're asking

2846.0 --> 2850.0
questions about that that being guys

2848.24 --> 2851.64
just showing up I'm just going to take

2850.0 --> 2854.52
your part of the troll gang and

2851.64 --> 2857.69
immediately kick you out

2854.52 --> 2859.8
cuz that's none of your damn

2857.69 --> 2864.92
[Music]

2859.8 --> 2866.3
business support me I'll take care of

2864.92 --> 2871.48
the rest of

2866.3 --> 2874.52
[Music]

2871.48 --> 2877.92
it up to the UK government to call like

2874.52 --> 2880.92
oh right right

2877.92 --> 2883.2400000000002
okay that that

2880.92 --> 2887.839
clarifies

2883.24 --> 2890.0
right uh but again yeah let me be clear

2887.839 --> 2891.599
with the whole prediction thing

2890.0 --> 2894.24
something's going to happen a potential

2891.599 --> 2896.92
Phoenix event it does not mean that

2894.24 --> 2901.72
literally the

2896.92 --> 2904.28
8th of April is literally like and

2901.72 --> 2907.319
suddenly the the troops start

2904.28 --> 2910.76
storming the capital or something

2907.319 --> 2914.2
it does not mean that although I can't

2910.76 --> 2914.2000000000003
technically exclude it

2918.52 --> 2924.599
maybe maybe the Confederate

2921.96 --> 2927.8
occultists that are probably a part of

2924.599 --> 2931.119
the the Deep State have actually oh you

2927.8 --> 2934.28
sent some too fibro oh thank you so much

2931.119 --> 2938.359

2955.2 --> 2962.96

2963.92 --> 2971.4
fantastic thank you for for yeah

2967.48 --> 2974.319
I know you guys aren't Rich exactly

2971.4 --> 2976.7200000000003
and so I really that makes me just

2974.319 --> 2978.2799999999997
appreciate it even more thank you so

2976.72 --> 2980.7599999999998
much for the

2978.28 --> 2983.76
[Music]

2980.76 --> 2983.76
help

2984.599 --> 2987.599
right

2988.599 --> 2994.4
yes it's just great because that's lit

2992.48 --> 2998.559
this literally dinner

2994.4 --> 3001.75
for it's dinner and lunch

2998.559 --> 3025.6400000000003
so this is absolutely

3001.75 --> 3028.64
[Music]

3025.64 --> 3028.64
excellent

3029.07 --> 3038.0
[Music]

3035.48 --> 3042.48
much did you get I got

3038.0 --> 3046.04
1830 in total that that is

3042.48 --> 3048.72
like probably good enough I mean more is

3046.04 --> 3052.7599999999998
always great I could always use it I

3048.72 --> 3054.24
mean I got extra bills you know like I

3052.76 --> 3057.28
got a a

3054.24 --> 3059.0
payment situation from from the debt

3057.28 --> 3062.119
that I did

3059.0 --> 3065.16
have that is like on top of my regular

3062.119 --> 3067.48
bills but probably by the end of May

3065.16 --> 3070.3999999999996
I'll be able to resolve all of that from

3067.48 --> 3074.799
the vacation money that I'll be

3070.4 --> 3077.079
getting but yeah this is

3074.799 --> 3078.839
fantastic it's kind of an emergency

3077.079 --> 3081.04
situation because something went wrong

3078.839 --> 3083.4
with the whole payment stuff and I had

3081.04 --> 3087.68
to like do some phone calls today before

3083.4 --> 3089.559
the show started to get that sorted out

3087.68 --> 3092.16
[Music]

3089.559 --> 3095.079
apparently like some of the rules with

3092.16 --> 3098.5989999999997
the welfare are slightly

3095.079 --> 3098.599
changing and

3099.0 --> 3106.44
yeah they're getting a bit

3102.079 --> 3108.09
tighter with like how they do that so I

3106.44 --> 3112.719
have to be

3108.09 --> 3112.719
[Music]

3113.2 --> 3118.839
careful right

3115.52 --> 3120.599
anyway excellent that's a real relief

3118.839 --> 3123.2
but as I was saying like yeah there's

3120.599 --> 3126.4
probably not going to be a direct

3123.2 --> 3129.24
storming off the capital on April 8th

3126.4 --> 3131.7200000000003
although if that would happen like

3129.24 --> 3134.1189999999997
people will be like completely blown

3131.72 --> 3139.0789999999997
away if that does happen

3134.119 --> 3141.1600000000003
like that's kind of obvious that they

3139.079 --> 3143.28
would right but it's probably not going

3141.16 --> 3146.96
to happen but what is happening is that

3143.28 --> 3150.599
there are this these energies going

3146.96 --> 3154.4
around strongly and

3150.599 --> 3155.92
energies can typically bring

3154.4 --> 3158.88
people

3155.92 --> 3162.839
vision and

3158.88 --> 3165.04
willpower and yeah everybody knows that

3162.839 --> 3166.88
things have been going badly in the

3165.04 --> 3169.68
United States for quite a while with a

3166.88 --> 3174.799
lot of demoralizing

3169.68 --> 3177.2
insanity and so it could be the spark

3174.799 --> 3180.359
that energy from the event could

3177.2 --> 3184.839
literally be the spark that is going to

3180.359 --> 3189.16
ignite the revolution or the Phoenix

3184.839 --> 3192.88
event CU I'm not yeah and it's going to

3189.16 --> 3195.72
likely be a a a deep State organized

3192.88 --> 3197.6400000000003
thing and not like oh all the citizens

3195.72 --> 3200.319
are going to come out with their weapons

3197.64 --> 3204.52
and apply the Second Amendment all of a

3200.319 --> 3204.52
sudden because that just seems

3205.44 --> 3209.559
like

3207.92 --> 3213.16
like that might have worked like 200

3209.559 --> 3214.88
years ago perhaps but now it's just it

3213.16 --> 3217.04
seems like everything's become too

3214.88 --> 3219.48
complicated and convoluted and

3217.04 --> 3222.599
distracted to even be able to achieve

3219.48 --> 3225.44
anything like that I mean theoretically

3222.599 --> 3228.7200000000003
it should still be possible but I

3225.44 --> 3231.4
mean it just don't see it happening but

3228.72 --> 3235.04
there's still this necessity to it so

3231.4 --> 3237.2000000000003
yeah a phoenix event might occur

3235.04 --> 3238.72
somewhere somewhere this

3237.2 --> 3241.2799999999997
[Music]

3238.72 --> 3243.04
year I mean even months back I was

3241.28 --> 3244.6400000000003
saying like something's going to happen

3243.04 --> 3246.5589999999997
this year something's going to happen

3244.64 --> 3248.839
this year I can feel it I can feel it

3246.559 --> 3250.119
coming very strongly like something's

3248.839 --> 3251.92
going to happen

3250.119 --> 3255.4
like and

3251.92 --> 3258.2400000000002
then the eclipse was brought to my

3255.4 --> 3261.48
attention and suddenly that feeling that

3258.24 --> 3263.72
I've been that's been building suddenly

3261.48 --> 3267.079
gained a bit of

3263.72 --> 3268.52
grip like perhaps it has something to do

3267.079 --> 3271.2000000000003
with

3268.52 --> 3275.599
this in a

3271.2 --> 3278.0
way right so I'm still anticipating that

3275.599 --> 3280.96
something's going to happen this

3278.0 --> 3284.96
year and I'm not just talking

3280.96 --> 3290.44
elections because there's that of course

3284.96 --> 3293.119
but it could be that it is

3290.44 --> 3297.04
all going to come down to that to the

3293.119 --> 3301.839
elections and the election result will

3297.04 --> 3305.599
probably be again like oh yes

3301.839 --> 3307.52
oh like we're just going to like nullify

3305.599 --> 3310.88
all the votes on Trump or something

3307.52 --> 3314.04
right I mean at this point you wouldn't

3310.88 --> 3314.04
put anything below

3314.319 --> 3323.0
them below the current government so but

3318.76 --> 3325.5200000000004
I mean it if that's going to happen

3323.0 --> 3326.839
again and they're almost bragging about

3325.52 --> 3330.7599999999998
it ahead of time

3326.839 --> 3335.0
even then well

3330.76 --> 3337.3190000000004
then the Phoenix event might then occur

3335.0 --> 3339.4
to take it back and then after that's

3337.319 --> 3343.48
happened like the whole thing is just

3339.4 --> 3343.48
going to be exposed

3343.68 --> 3349.9199999999996
and and all the crimes that have been

3346.52 --> 3352.92
stacking up are going to

3349.92 --> 3352.92
be

3355.24 --> 3360.7799999999997
resolved

3357.73 --> 3360.78
[Music]

3364.52 --> 3373.0389999999998
yeah yeah so any more inquiries about my

3370.52 --> 3376.7599999999998
finances will be met with instant

3373.039 --> 3378.0800000000004
Banning let me emphasize again it's none

3376.76 --> 3379.6800000000003
of your damn

3378.08 --> 3381.21
[Music]

3379.68 --> 3384.9199999999996

3384.92 --> 3390.7200000000003
yeah you can help me out by donating to

3388.559 --> 3394.6800000000003

patreon I will take as

3394.76 --> 3404.079
gifts and yeah I need it but uh yeah I'm

3400.52 --> 3406.559
not going to give you a review of my TX

3404.079 --> 3409.2000000000003
situation

3406.559 --> 3411.0
yes so if you're going to try I'll just

3409.2 --> 3414.1189999999997
kick you out and it's last time I even

3411.0 --> 3414.119
going to say anything about

3414.16 --> 3418.24
[Music]

3415.24 --> 3418.24
it

3419.2 --> 3425.64
right hey woodworking guny bear good to

3420.96 --> 3425.64
see you by the way you already

3428.319 --> 3432.88
there copies of eclips are projected on

3430.96 --> 3434.799
ground yes isn't it amazing yeah in

3432.88 --> 3438.6400000000003
every

3434.799 --> 3442.119
shadow you start to see that

3438.64 --> 3442.1189999999997
Eclipse which is

3445.16 --> 3448.16
amazing

3449.48 --> 3454.76
if you look at the

3451.48 --> 3456.96
eclipse like when you're standing right

3454.76 --> 3459.559
next to the shadow of a

3456.96 --> 3461.64
tree with leaves in it and everything

3459.559 --> 3463.76
then like you can literally see the

3461.64 --> 3467.0
eclipse in every part of the shadow of

3463.76 --> 3467.0
the tree it's it is

3468.95 --> 3472.0
[Music]

3475.119 --> 3478.119
astounding

3480.839 --> 3487.72
right and again in this case it's take

3484.44 --> 3487.7200000000003
it's to be taken as a

3492.039 --> 3499.8390000000004
sign energies are there more than usual

3495.96 --> 3499.839
more than just normal Springtime

3501.2 --> 3506.68
energies so I really feel like this is

3503.96 --> 3508.7200000000003
the year when it really changes

3506.68 --> 3512.2
it's a year when I've gone through a

3508.72 --> 3512.2
pretty dramatic change

3535.039 --> 3539.2400000000002
myself

3536.68 --> 3542.0
debatable D you're really being

3539.24 --> 3542.0
ridiculous

3549.079 --> 3552.6800000000003
here I mean this

3552.839 --> 3560.0
phraseology an apparent moral low point

3556.799 --> 3560.0
you keep hearing

3560.799 --> 3565.0389999999998
really I mean do you have any moral

3563.559 --> 3568.039
compass at

3565.039 --> 3568.039
all

3586.41 --> 3589.469
[Music]

3595.039 --> 3598.039
for

3611.33 --> 3615.639
[Music]

3624.96 --> 3631.88
for

3627.64 --> 3635.24
depravity being spoken about yeah uh

3631.88 --> 3638.4
well I'm not going to like bring up all

3635.24 --> 3640.3999999999996
that crap here on my show I'll leave

3638.4 --> 3643.799
that the channels that really like to

3640.4 --> 3643.799
focus on that sort of

3645.44 --> 3651.119
thing right but I mean it's all over the

3654.92 --> 3657.92
place

3661.16 --> 3665.24
that's interesting Yes W work G yeah the

3663.52 --> 3667.359
Constitution of the United States is

3665.24 --> 3671.24
very specifically about the individual

3667.359 --> 3675.2799999999997
and the individual rights given by

3671.24 --> 3675.2799999999997
God emphasized by the

3684.52 --> 3688.88
Constitution that is a holistic

3686.44 --> 3690.7200000000003
statement yeah but I think in in this

3688.88 --> 3692.88
case when we're talking about that we're

3690.72 --> 3699.0389999999998
talking about the

3692.88 --> 3703.4
government the federal government to be

3699.039 --> 3706.6400000000003
specific yeah not every human being

3703.4 --> 3706.64
living in the United

3714.839 --> 3717.839
States

3722.839 --> 3726.599
when was the Federal Government more

3729.839 --> 3737.599
moral last century and it wasn't super

3734.079 --> 3737.599
great but it was

3744.839 --> 3752.0789999999997
better at least they didn't like try to

3747.559 --> 3755.3590000000004
force this insane Marxist culture on

3752.079 --> 3755.3590000000004
everybody last

3765.599 --> 3771.599
century right you can really recognize

3769.72 --> 3774.9199999999996
like when the federal government is

3771.599 --> 3777.839
better is when they're staying out of

3774.92 --> 3777.839
everybody's business

3781.0 --> 3786.359
business Yeah the more they stay out of

3783.319 --> 3787.839
everybody's business the better they are

3786.359 --> 3792.319
because the original Federal

3787.839 --> 3795.279
government's tasks are were very limited

3792.319 --> 3798.279
specifically on

3795.279 --> 3798.279
purpose

3798.44 --> 3804.76
and especially in this Century they've

3801.48 --> 3807.48
just started to bloat up with

3804.76 --> 3810.3190000000004
self-importance trength to impose all

3807.48 --> 3810.319
these things on

3811.2 --> 3815.4399999999996
everybody growing their

3816.559 --> 3820.4
influence and that's the whole

3825.9 --> 3828.9590000000003
[Music]

3834.2 --> 3839.359
problem yeah yeah and the media is a

3837.559 --> 3841.52
whole another thing I mean the media is

3839.359 --> 3844.2
technically not part of the United

3841.52 --> 3845.92
States government but there're certainly

3844.2 --> 3847.96
In Cahoots with

3845.92 --> 3851.119
this

3847.96 --> 3853.2
faction and they are like just

3851.119 --> 3855.76
manipulating and programming and

3853.2 --> 3855.7599999999998
creating

3856.319 --> 3863.0
this this extreme

3859.599 --> 3866.88
dichotomy emphasizing that creating

3863.0 --> 3870.839
polarization within within the actual

3866.88 --> 3870.839
citizenry which is a terrible

3885.599 --> 3892.559
influence regulation against Monopoly

3888.48 --> 3892.559
yeah it's called Anti-Trust

3894.64 --> 3898.0
laws

3896.599 --> 3900.44
is that not

3898.0 --> 3902.92
contradictory no it's not contradictory

3900.44 --> 3906.44
that's the actual one of the few

3902.92 --> 3906.44
functions that they should

3907.119 --> 3910.48
do and they

3913.359 --> 3918.68
don't right CU they also have authority

3917.039 --> 3922.7990000000004
over

3918.68 --> 3924.64
uh Continental Logistics

3922.799 --> 3927.2
and

3924.64 --> 3929.2
commerce so it's like one of the few

3927.2 --> 3932.0789999999997
things that they actually should be

3929.2 --> 3935.4399999999996
doing and they don't do it instead they

3932.079 --> 3939.6400000000003
give Mega corporations just full full

3935.44 --> 3939.64
Reign Over however they want to do

3945.359 --> 3951.839
things and giving them like major tax

3949.16 --> 3953.72
exemption status and all these things

3951.839 --> 3956.7599999999998
it's it's a

3953.72 --> 3961.0389999999998
mess they're not uphold holding their

3956.76 --> 3961.039
function as a federal government

3974.72 --> 3980.9199999999996
properly so debatable D I don't like

3978.4 --> 3983.359
your attitude your attitude's really

3980.92 --> 3984.559
rotten is this like not the first time

3983.359 --> 3987.5589999999997
you've done

3984.559 --> 3987.559
that

3991.92 --> 3997.359
like it just feels like you're just

3994.16 --> 3999.44
trying to entrap me in some kind of like

3997.359 --> 4003.88
hypocrisy or

3999.44 --> 4003.88
something it's starting to really

4009.64 --> 4017.24
smell yeah there is no hypocrisy in my

4012.64 --> 4020.5989999999997
statements at all I've been very

4017.24 --> 4023.5989999999997
accurate like I know what the functions

4020.599 --> 4026.6400000000003
are of the federal

4023.599 --> 4029.76
government and everything I've said did

4026.64 --> 4033.5589999999997
not contrast with statements I've made

4029.76 --> 4037.76
before so maybe you need to stop

4033.559 --> 4042.6400000000003
trying to push some kind of

4037.76 --> 4044.119
hypocrisy on on my explanations about it

4042.64 --> 4047.799
because there isn't

4044.119 --> 4049.6400000000003
any there is no hypocrisy in my Approach

4047.799 --> 4053.2
of the federal government of the United

4049.64 --> 4056.92
States yeah I think that everybody here

4053.2 --> 4056.9199999999996
is pretty well aware of

4056.96 --> 4062.2
that except for you and

4063.119 --> 4066.839
trolls starting to wonder if you're

4065.2 --> 4070.7599999999998
actually one of

4066.839 --> 4070.7599999999998
them and you keep doing

4071.69 --> 4077.44
[Music]

4074.44 --> 4077.44
this

4094.72 --> 4101.759
to political parties

4097.279 --> 4101.759
yeah but yeah I mean it's a

4104.44 --> 4107.44
mess

4112.759 --> 4118.12
the Republican party is a terrible

4115.92 --> 4120.88
mess and they're

4118.12 --> 4122.759
like everybody's really like even on

4120.88 --> 4125.4800000000005
Alex Jones when they're starting to talk

4122.759 --> 4128.4
about you know like the hour is

4125.48 --> 4130.12
late that they're basically acting like

4128.4 --> 4131.799
a controlled opposition for the

4130.12 --> 4133.48
Democratic party and they're like

4131.799 --> 4137.839
they're supposed to oppose certain

4133.48 --> 4137.839
things and then they just don't do do it

4139.319 --> 4146.080000000001
successfully and

4141.08 --> 4148.44
thereby like ensuring Democrat Party

4146.08 --> 4151.44
control they keep doing it they have

4148.44 --> 4151.44
been doing it for a

4153.44 --> 4161.0
while you will let my words speak forsel

4156.56 --> 4163.6
yeah yeah indeed my words do speak for

4161.0 --> 4166.12
themselves and there is no hypocrisy in

4163.6 --> 4170.4800000000005
the things that I've said the hypocrisy

4166.12 --> 4170.48
is in your mind not

4177.93 --> 4181.069
[Music]

4184.679 --> 4191.679
mine reasonable questions

4187.88 --> 4191.679
okay you think so

4194.32 --> 4199.62
lcut

4196.41 --> 4199.62
[Music]

4207.159 --> 4211.719
but I think there's not a lot of people

4208.96 --> 4213.8
around except for Democratic party

4211.719 --> 4217.92
operatives and Marxist

4213.8 --> 4219.679
Communists that don't think that the

4217.92 --> 4221.88
Democratic federal government is making

4219.679 --> 4225.92
a giant mess of things is overreaching

4221.88 --> 4227.92
is breaking rules all over the place and

4225.92 --> 4230.56
is not

4227.92 --> 4233.1990000000005
actually performing the functions that

4230.56 --> 4237.52
they should as a federal

4233.199 --> 4241.96
government like enforcing monopoly laws

4237.52 --> 4244.8
but then again yeah the Republicans in

4241.96 --> 4247.08
power don't exactly seem to be doing

4244.8 --> 4247.08
that

4248.0 --> 4254.04
either so it's an overall issue with the

4251.56 --> 4254.04
federal

4254.239 --> 4257.239

slow mo mo buy let me

4494.0 --> 4497.0
see

4508.4 --> 4512.32
why so many people in chat have no

4510.8 --> 4514.6
profile

4512.32 --> 4517.32
picks because they didn't take the

4514.6 --> 4517.320000000001
effort to do

4523.96 --> 4529.4800000000005
that

4525.84 --> 4529.4800000000005
I mean it's not mandatory or

4530.159 --> 4534.759999999999
anything does give a bit of a nice touch

4539.84 --> 4545.08
though but yeah a lot of the times like

4542.8 --> 4548.1990000000005
trolls just end up copying their

4545.08 --> 4548.199
pictures and all that

4550.4 --> 4553.92
anyway

4551.92 --> 4555.78

so

4555.78 --> 4558.87
[Music]

4560.4 --> 4564.28
uh I'm wondering what I could be talking

4562.96 --> 4567.59
about

4564.28 --> 4569.239
now cuz yeah

4567.59 --> 4572.32
[Music]

4569.239 --> 4576.959999999999
I'm kind of

4572.32 --> 4580.239
short on more material considering the

4576.96 --> 4582.76
precolonial Celtic America there not a

4580.239 --> 4584.879999999999
lot I really know about

4582.76 --> 4588.8
that might be some other research

4584.88 --> 4588.8
Searchers that have done videos about

4602.12 --> 4605.12
that

4605.52 --> 4612.0
what frater crashed into a bridge what

4613.84 --> 4616.84
no

4620.44 --> 4623.839999999999
where where did that

4626.88 --> 4636.159000000001
happen what does deata mean

4632.0 --> 4640.0
uh I'm not entirely sure but it's it's

4636.159 --> 4645.32
part of the of the name of that I mean

4640.0 --> 4647.76
if you Google it St Andrews crew deata

4645.32 --> 4647.759999999999
that's a

4649.15 --> 4653.228999999999
[Music]

4653.48 --> 4664.199
thing it's I guess another word for the

[Music]

4673.84 --> 4676.84

4685.92 --> 4692.76
don't know where the

4695.88 --> 4702.159000000001
actually what the [ __ ] does deade

4699.88 --> 4703.76

that's what it means it's Latin for

4710.679 --> 4718.04
Crossways Crossroads so deata is like a

4714.6 --> 4722.280000000001
word for Crossroads

4718.04 --> 4726.239
basically which is also very

4722.28 --> 4728.96
interesting like

4726.239 --> 4732.199
esoterically cuz what is a crossroads

4728.96 --> 4736.0
right the crossroads is often used as a

4732.199 --> 4737.32
reference of like a Crossroads is where

4736.0 --> 4739.44
things

4737.32 --> 4742.08

wrenches still there just I don't know

4775.44 --> 4781.12
sitting in the background

4777.32 --> 4781.12
perhaps clutch was here

4785.6 --> 4792.1990000000005
earlier I talked

4787.679 --> 4792.1990000000005
to Richard G yesterday over

4793.639 --> 4799.4400000000005
Skype

4796.36 --> 4802.28
he said that he might potentially like

4799.44 --> 4802.28
take a bit of a

4808.44 --> 4813.12
sabatical and like need some time off

4811.48 --> 4817.08
away from the internet which I

4813.12 --> 4819.8
completely understand but yeah we'll see

4817.08 --> 4822.92
if if he does that or

4819.8 --> 4825.4800000000005
not things are good

4822.92 --> 4826.92
though uh

4825.48 --> 4828.919999999999
the other wrenches I don't know where

4826.92 --> 4833.36
they

4828.92 --> 4833.36
are G is probably just really

4853.639 --> 4856.639
busy

4856.96 --> 4862.159
you lost your rent for crackling

4859.239 --> 4862.159
cracking too many

4862.76 --> 4868.76
jokes yeah and a while back I like

4866.56 --> 4872.0
there's troll infiltrant going around

4868.76 --> 4874.679
and so I had to like take measures to

4872.0 --> 4877.719
ensure that that wouldn't happen again

4874.679 --> 4880.56
so I I'm just having a a minimal amount

4877.719 --> 4883.56
of wrenches that I hand out and I do

4880.56 --> 4885.660000000001

4964.12 --> 4967.4
bear that's

4969.8 --> 4976.4400000000005
hilarious yeah there's nothing wrong

4971.84 --> 4976.4400000000005
with the consuming a bit of

4980.12 --> 4986.199
chalk prrs

4983.199 --> 4986.199
yuck

5003.44 --> 5006.44
no

5016.76 --> 5021.4400000000005
right let's see what can I dig up I

5020.12 --> 5024.92
think

5021.44 --> 5027.44
maybe can move on probably this is also

5024.92 --> 5030.6
the last time I'm going to do a show

5027.44 --> 5036.44
themed about this unless I stumble upon

5030.6 --> 5036.4400000000005
something new that blows my mind again

5039.36 --> 5047.04
o Benjamin show yesterday was

5043.08 --> 5047.04
great very interesting

5048.88 --> 5056.1990000000005
tips got a new Saturday night lifestyle

5053.12 --> 5058.5599999999995
sketches too which are always

5056.199 --> 5063.32
fun

5058.56 --> 5066.320000000001
uh let see what else is going on out

5063.32 --> 5066.32
there

5093.32 --> 5096.32
m

5104.32 --> 5108.759999999999
oh there was a farmers protest outside

5106.48 --> 5111.04
of the parliament in

5108.76 --> 5114.400000000001
London

5111.04 --> 5114.4
yesterday that was

5116.92 --> 5123.08
interesting so yeah farmers are like

5119.679 --> 5125.32
doing this everywhere they're like very

5123.08 --> 5128.159
well organized too

5125.32 --> 5128.159
which is all very

5128.88 --> 5135.639
encouraging CU it's like yeah during

5131.96 --> 5139.04
Marxist revolutions the farmers are

5135.639 --> 5143.32
like the most important factor to they

5139.04 --> 5143.32
have to survive or like everybody's

5144.239 --> 5148.919999999999
screwed also I've been continuing

5153.239 --> 5156.239
watching

5156.36 --> 5162.96
and continuing watching three body

5159.76 --> 5164.96
problem and it seems like my estimation

5162.96 --> 5167.88
of there being some kind of time travel

5164.96 --> 5171.08
involved was off it

5167.88 --> 5172.8
wasn't something very different very

5171.08 --> 5175.96
fascinating

5172.8 --> 5180.84
I'm my mind's being kind of

5175.96 --> 5184.719
blown with that series I'm like into

5180.84 --> 5189.28
episode three now and it is no SP

5184.719 --> 5189.28
spoilers oh okay fair

5190.199 --> 5197.879999999999
enough but I mean they basically tackle

5193.679 --> 5199.08
some really weird stuff like that even

5197.88 --> 5203.639
like

5199.08 --> 5207.8
tated my idea that like wait are they

5203.639 --> 5210.679
actually actually like starting to apply

5207.8 --> 5213.2390000000005
even in minor ways the idea of the

5210.679 --> 5215.84
celestial lights being non-local

5213.239 --> 5217.48
Holograms

5215.84 --> 5222.4400000000005
I'll not say

5217.48 --> 5225.5599999999995
how but I mean there's some really weird

5222.44 --> 5225.5599999999995
interesting hints in

5226.52 --> 5237.96
there also it seems like my prediction

5230.719 --> 5240.88
in the past about how uh virtual reality

5237.96 --> 5242.84
like where where it would go at what it

5240.88 --> 5245.36
would be like that it would basically be

5242.84 --> 5247.32
a circlet in no freaking chips in your

5245.36 --> 5248.92
head it's just a circlet and it just

5247.32 --> 5253.4
you're you're in

5248.92 --> 5256.08
it seems like they've basically put that

5253.4 --> 5258.638999999999
into this series and it's a bigger part

5256.08 --> 5261.96
of what it's

5258.639 --> 5264.2390000000005
about pretty

5261.96 --> 5267.44
mindblowing but the whole thing is is

5264.239 --> 5271.48
kind of set up like a a big mystery

5267.44 --> 5274.759999999999
thing and it's all about the science

5271.48 --> 5277.4
oh so we have to defend the

5274.76 --> 5279.6
science it's like they are all freaking

5277.4 --> 5282.638999999999
science obsessed and there's some crazy

5279.6 --> 5285.84
[ __ ] happening in there even by because

5282.639 --> 5288.119
of scientists it is all very interesting

5285.84 --> 5288.119000000001
and it

5289.639 --> 5297.08
is I really wonder what like it will do

5292.639 --> 5299.4400000000005
to real science Believers watching that

5297.08 --> 5303.119
like it's going to it's going to

5299.44 --> 5306.119
probably like get them very unnerved in

5303.119 --> 5306.119
ways

5307.08 --> 5310.84
because it it seems like the whole

5308.8 --> 5314.6
series really is

5310.84 --> 5317.2390000000005
about the science

5314.6 --> 5320.719
religion in which it is not of course

5317.239 --> 5322.718999999999
accepted as a religion but the way that

5320.719 --> 5326.76
how they talk about it how it is

5322.719 --> 5330.52
reflected upon it is made very evident

5326.76 --> 5334.1990000000005
that it is a religion it's fascinating

5330.52 --> 5336.88
it's really fascinating like that so I'm

5334.199 --> 5338.719
very curious to see more but I mean you

5336.88 --> 5340.88
have to be careful watching this series

5338.719 --> 5343.52
because it is really freaking heavy

5340.88 --> 5347.04
especially like the

5343.52 --> 5350.6
continual maest China situation there is

5347.04 --> 5353.4
like pretty rough not that there's like

5350.6 --> 5357.08
really a lot of horror or whatever or

5353.4 --> 5360.719
Terror or whatever but it's just harsh

5357.08 --> 5362.5199999999995
and they basically do references to

5360.719 --> 5365.28
environmentalism like

5362.52 --> 5367.400000000001
how communist Chinese were just

5365.28 --> 5369.8
completely

5367.4 --> 5372.719
Relentless towards nature like not

5369.8 --> 5375.8
giving a [ __ ] at all that that that is a

5372.719 --> 5379.52
theme that comes by and it is just

5375.8 --> 5381.639
horrifying cuz that's real like that

5379.52 --> 5385.280000000001
those things really did happen it's

5381.639 --> 5388.96
terrible terrible stuff and in that

5385.28 --> 5390.5199999999995
sense interesting from a third look

5388.96 --> 5393.4800000000005
third view

5390.52 --> 5395.56
perspective that Netflix would actually

5393.48 --> 5398.959999999999
engage

5395.56 --> 5400.4400000000005
in a series that would critici communist

5398.96 --> 5405.88
China like

5400.44 --> 5410.919999999999
that in a very fundamental way that

5405.88 --> 5414.2390000000005
is an interesting development and change

5410.92 --> 5417.96
cuz for a very long time it's like that

5414.239 --> 5420.36
was a no-o zone for like the entirety of

5417.96 --> 5424.88
Hollywood you couldn't say anything bad

5420.36 --> 5428.28
about China and this seems to be like

5424.88 --> 5431.400000000001
a change to that and that's interesting

5428.28 --> 5431.4
it's an interesting

5437.6 --> 5445.4800000000005
change oh God what we going you have to

5440.4 --> 5445.48
really do that yeah you probably did

5446.32 --> 5453.44
but but I mean the circuit that they use

5449.679 --> 5456.8
in there you won't need anything it is

5453.44 --> 5459.159
like a full Matrix virtual reality

5456.8 --> 5462.4800000000005
system it's like plugging into the

5459.159 --> 5462.48
Matrix without using a

5463.36 --> 5469.4
plug which is kind of what I Envision I

5467.239 --> 5472.4
envisioned that like years ago I talked

5469.4 --> 5474.839999999999
about it like that's where it will go

5472.4 --> 5477.199
seems like this series is like

5474.84 --> 5479.719
completely embracing that concept and

5477.199 --> 5479.719
going with

5480.76 --> 5485.92
it it's interesting

5493.52 --> 5498.4800000000005
Anon petol video I don't know who that

5501.36 --> 5507.759999999999
is so that's a

5503.92 --> 5507.76
no I can Google

5512.84 --> 5520.04
him oh that's that's not a good start my

5516.28 --> 5522.92
name is Anon and I explain

5520.04 --> 5528.96
science

5522.92 --> 5532.56
math and other complicated topics using

5528.96 --> 5532.56
simulations all righty

5542.84 --> 5545.84
then

5547.679 --> 5553.0
I think I've saw that guy before that's

5549.48 --> 5553.0
like a real nerd isn't

5554.719 --> 5559.0
he yeah I've seen that

5560.199 --> 5566.638999999999
before he's been going at it for a

5563.52 --> 5570.400000000001
while is it

5566.639 --> 5574.639
since yeah September 29th

5570.4 --> 5577.4
2011 yeah I know that guy or know him

5574.639 --> 5577.400000000001
I've seen his

5588.95 --> 5592.16
[Music]

5592.52 --> 5597.84
videos bottomless pit of f for me to be

5596.04 --> 5600.08
that's not what I do anymore would work

5597.84 --> 5600.08
can go

5601.6 --> 5609.2390000000005
anywhere why would I do that

5605.32 --> 5609.239
well I'm not interested in beating up

5611.1 --> 5616.360000000001
[Music]

5612.44 --> 5617.719
anybody I mean what's the point it's not

5616.36 --> 5620.719
like they're going to

5617.719 --> 5624.159
stop what so we could have some back and

5620.719 --> 5624.159
forth I doubt

5632.719 --> 5635.719
it

5636.52 --> 5643.76
I mean I have my ideas I have my views

5639.52 --> 5647.119000000001
on how I believe this world

5643.76 --> 5649.92
Works quite they're quite distinct my

5647.119 --> 5652.159
ideas in that sense don't see it being

5649.92 --> 5655.4800000000005
echoed out there a

5652.159 --> 5657.5199999999995
lot and scientist and people have their

5655.48 --> 5659.879999999999
views of everything and everybody's

5657.52 --> 5662.719
super familiar with those

5659.88 --> 5665.719
views and

5662.719 --> 5665.719
uh

5674.28 --> 5680.04
yeah I mean you can always just ask

5676.92 --> 5683.1990000000005
questions or say like hey this person

5680.04 --> 5687.56
said this and that what do you think and

5683.199 --> 5687.5599999999995
I'll be able to like roll out an answer

5687.6 --> 5694.119000000001
then explain the misconceptions and

5690.52 --> 5698.119000000001
explain how I would view it that's what

5694.119 --> 5702.28
I can do I'm not really interested in

5698.119 --> 5705.28
like reviewing other channels and like

5702.28 --> 5709.239
criticizing everything they say it's

5705.28 --> 5709.239
just I'm tired of all

5717.08 --> 5722.6
that oh my coffee I almost forgot be

5720.36 --> 5722.599999999999
right

5722.639 --> 5725.639
back

5809.52 --> 5818.119000000001
virtual black hole

5812.52 --> 5818.119000000001
really virtual black hole

5821.719 --> 5827.88
wow so they created a non-actual black

5826.199 --> 5831.759999999999
hole did

5827.88 --> 5831.76
they how incredibly

5831.96 --> 5835.96
useful like what does that even

5842.52 --> 5850.280000000001
mean they create

5845.84 --> 5854.159000000001
a a visual of what they think a black

5850.28 --> 5856.0
hole would be like did like what or they

5854.159 --> 5859.96
created a black

5856.0 --> 5862.88
hole within a virtual simulation like

5859.96 --> 5866.0
with the physics engine that they could

5862.88 --> 5866.0
simulate the whole

5870.84 --> 5877.08
thing sound and Light

5874.08 --> 5877.08
black

5884.28 --> 5889.679
what it that just sounds like a bunch of

5887.159 --> 5893.839999999999
math nonsense really and that is what a

5889.679 --> 5897.679
black hole is I mean black hole to this

5893.84 --> 5897.679
day is still just a mathematical

[Music]

6011.96 --> 6017.36
what it's from those guys who ruin Game

6015.36 --> 6020.239
of Thrones what what are you talking

6017.36 --> 6023.159
about did they ruin

6020.239 --> 6025.239
it well there is that act there is like

6023.159 --> 6028.5599999999995
the the actor in it again like the the

6025.239 --> 6031.839999999999
Wizard guy who's awesome one of my

6028.56 --> 6034.939
favorite nerd actors ever he is in

6031.84 --> 6034.939
[Music]

6042.76 --> 6047.92
it I don't know I think that they're

6044.96 --> 6051.04
doing great but it is like it is like a

6047.92 --> 6053.84
science nerd Fest though all of it

6051.04 --> 6056.599
they're all scientists in the they are

6053.84 --> 6059.52
so good and they're all on the on the

6056.599 --> 6062.119000000001
cusp of super high tech technology

6059.52 --> 6062.119000000001
development

6062.159 --> 6067.96
Etc David benov oh is that his

6078.679 --> 6081.679
name

6082.0 --> 6087.199
no there is that the maker of the series

6090.48 --> 6095.32
okay he did do three body problem

6100.599 --> 6106.400000000001
yeah wow three body problem really just

6103.639 --> 6106.400000000001
came out didn't

6107.4 --> 6115.239
it now what I'm I'm talking about John

6110.96 --> 6115.2390000000005
Bradley he's in there he's

6142.159 --> 6145.159
awesome

6148.48 --> 6154.159
released 21st of

6150.599 --> 6159.32
March whoa holy

6154.159 --> 6162.08
[ __ ] really so it it just now got really

6159.32 --> 6163.96
I got like the first release moment it

6162.08 --> 6165.28
just got out I didn't even know that I

6163.96 --> 6168.0
thought like oh that's probably been

6165.28 --> 6172.119
around for a while it just I literally

6168.0 --> 6174.04
popped in my face like the day it was

6172.119 --> 6177.679
released

6174.04 --> 6180.96
wow but it's it's

6177.679 --> 6184.56
intense it is intense and it's like to

6180.96 --> 6187.599
me in ways unintendedly

6184.56 --> 6191.320000000001
hilarious especially like oh the Marty

6187.599 --> 6195.92
dumb for science oh it's

6191.32 --> 6197.32
like you guys are [ __ ] idiots like oh

6195.92 --> 6201.159
yeah oh

6197.32 --> 6204.0
wow if experiment says it's that doesn't

6201.159 --> 6206.28
work out well then the science is wrong

6204.0 --> 6209.76
yeah yeah it

6206.28 --> 6209.759999999999
is that was

6214.119 --> 6219.0
epic I really wonder like what more of

6216.88 --> 6221.96
this kind of stuff are they is is going

6219.0 --> 6225.76
to roll out in the series right but I

6221.96 --> 6225.76
guess it's still all very spoiler

6225.8 --> 6232.400000000001
sensitive

6227.52 --> 6234.88
so and I'm I'm only like two episodes in

6232.4 --> 6239.0
anyway but I mean every episode's like

6234.88 --> 6239.0
pretty compacted with

6240.92 --> 6245.52
stuff right yeah woodwor gy be see you

6246.4 --> 6251.119
later I had no idea that it had just

6249.0 --> 6254.56
been usually I'm like not watching

6251.119 --> 6254.5599999999995
Series right as they're being

6257.52 --> 6265.52
released book was written huh

6261.719 --> 6265.52
2008 that is really

6271.56 --> 6274.56
early

6281.159 --> 6284.719
huh it's pretty

6287.4 --> 6291.799999999999
revolutionary the book is probably very

6292.04 --> 6295.04
interesting

6321.96 --> 6324.96
for

6335.92 --> 6341.719
hey Richie G good to see you I was just

6338.76 --> 6341.719
thinking about you

6342.199 --> 6346.5599999999995
like hope you had a good

6351.92 --> 6354.92
night

6356.88 --> 6362.08
I hope you're feeling a bit

6359.36 --> 6365.4
better I did apply the

6362.08 --> 6369.96
technique I was still wondering

6365.4 --> 6369.96
like what your findings are about

6371.08 --> 6379.48
it the follow up is Dark Forest oh

6376.48 --> 6379.48
okay

6381.92 --> 6384.92
huh

6388.31 --> 6391.369000000001
[Music]

6411.84 --> 6414.84
for

6432.8 --> 6435.119000000001
oh

6436.239 --> 6440.598999999999
what crappier today that's not

6441.84 --> 6446.88
good

6444.48 --> 6448.799999999999
I don't know it's kind of weird I'm

6446.88 --> 6452.0
feeling a

6448.8 --> 6455.639
bit more tired as well but I mean the

6452.0 --> 6458.719
Moon is raining and

6455.639 --> 6462.92
like like I've been just highly

6458.719 --> 6467.52
energized through yeah the whole finding

6462.92 --> 6467.52
of the Neve eclipse and all the

6467.679 --> 6473.09
correlating symbols and pieces of

6470.48 --> 6474.799999999999
information but I do feel like

6473.09 --> 6480.04
[Music]

6474.8 --> 6483.2390000000005
book is death's end oh Jesus

6480.04 --> 6485.679
okay right debateable these so there

6483.239 --> 6488.638999999999
could be

6485.679 --> 6490.56
more more follow-ups of the three body

6488.639 --> 6492.4400000000005
problems here I'd be very curious to see

6490.56 --> 6495.4400000000005
it because thus far it's

6492.44 --> 6495.44
been

6497.32 --> 6501.759999999999
interesting right but yeah Richard G I

6500.45 --> 6504.76
[Music]

6501.76 --> 6504.76
mean

6505.52 --> 6512.4800000000005
well I survived the actual

6508.44 --> 6512.48
Eclipse I wouldn't see why

6517.4 --> 6522.32
not I mean me personally I'm not even

6520.08 --> 6524.84
going to see the eclipse like why would

6522.32 --> 6524.84
you say

6526.119 --> 6531.0
that why wouldn't I survive the

6531.719 --> 6534.719
eclipse

6541.639 --> 6548.36
no Richard G he said that it's directed

6544.639 --> 6552.119
by the same director as Game of

6548.36 --> 6552.119
Thrones he didn't write

6554.08 --> 6558.719
it or adapted it

6561.719 --> 6567.52
yeah

6563.599 --> 6572.360000000001
thinking about it has tired me yeah but

6567.52 --> 6572.360000000001
the tiredness is also probably

6572.52 --> 6579.599
just the anticipation was enormous on my

6576.679 --> 6583.4800000000005
side I haven't been like enthusiastic

6579.599 --> 6585.639
about something that much in a while

6583.48 --> 6588.0
like been inspired like that and and

6585.639 --> 6590.84
it's like it's

6588.0 --> 6594.679
just I have to basically like Let It Go

6590.84 --> 6598.08
for a bit and and then maybe maybe I'll

6594.679 --> 6602.119
be lucky and stumble upon some things I

6598.08 --> 6605.0
mean the correlations and the potential

6602.119 --> 6605.0
Phoenix event

6605.239 --> 6610.598999999999
predictions they're just they're done I

6607.719 --> 6612.8
I done them you can't expect me to be

6610.599 --> 6614.92
like energized all year long in

6612.8 --> 6618.0
anticipation of it happening any moment

6614.92 --> 6620.1990000000005
now like I'm not going to be like

6618.0 --> 6623.56
that I got the

6620.199 --> 6625.799999999999
energy and

6623.56 --> 6628.4400000000005
something is going to happen I'm

6625.8 --> 6628.4400000000005
convinced of

6634.56 --> 6641.0
It kind of ridiculous statement is that

6637.32 --> 6641.0
that make sure this is not

6644.56 --> 6647.56
funny

6651.639 --> 6656.0
why

6653.92 --> 6658.36
saying something like that kind of just

6656.0 --> 6661.199
makes you look like a troll especially

6658.36 --> 6663.04
because you're not providing any logical

6661.199 --> 6666.879999999999
context to

6663.04 --> 6666.88
even draw such a

6671.679 --> 6678.599
conclusion don't be so

6674.48 --> 6682.159
serious uh yeah I will be so serious I

6678.599 --> 6684.32
am serious I I don't like hanging around

6682.159 --> 6686.799999999999
with people that aren't serious and just

6684.32 --> 6687.96
like blabbering random nonsense I don't

6686.8 --> 6690.360000000001
like

6687.96 --> 6693.119
that I usually end up kicking those

6690.36 --> 6693.119
people out of my

6693.599 --> 6699.52
chat because it's

6695.719 --> 6702.28
distracting and it doesn't yield it

6699.52 --> 6702.280000000001
doesn't do

6711.52 --> 6714.52
anything

6717.28 --> 6724.759999999999
yeah this we are not living in a chaotic

6721.44 --> 6727.36
era where you literally have to be wary

6724.76 --> 6731.2390000000005
of what the sun is doing

6727.36 --> 6735.36
because yeah you actually have to watch

6731.239 --> 6735.36
the three body problem to know what that

6737.599 --> 6743.76
means oh

6740.48 --> 6746.36
wow okay okay well then it's smashing

6743.76 --> 6749.599
trolls time fine I'll just kick people

6746.36 --> 6752.4
out then that

6749.599 --> 6757.400000000001
is what I'm here to do and that's what

6752.4 --> 6757.4
I'm here to do I have no problem doing

6771.44 --> 6774.44
that

6801.44 --> 6804.44
e

6806.72 --> 6809.799
[Music]

6820.679 --> 6824.119
right but

6824.76 --> 6831.04
uh I'm probably going to run out the

6827.84 --> 6834.88
show a little bit short shorter than

6831.04 --> 6838.32
normal not like the usual 2 and 1 half

6834.88 --> 6841.2390000000005
hours that's called short these days I

6838.32 --> 6843.04
still remember like doing a show and

6841.239 --> 6847.638999999999
then 2 hours would be

6843.04 --> 6850.92
long now 2 hours is

6847.639 --> 6850.92
short that's

6860.0 --> 6867.36
weird all right

6863.0 --> 6870.88
and uh considering that I will be having

6867.36 --> 6873.92
some ability to get food and all

6870.88 --> 6876.679
that hopefully tomorrow I'll be a little

6873.92 --> 6879.4800000000005
bit more energized and we could like

6876.679 --> 6881.76
talk about other stuff again maybe more

6879.48 --> 6886.4
flat earth related subjects maybe I can

6881.76 --> 6888.4400000000005
get go through for example the Nature's

6886.4 --> 6891.719
of the celestials and what I think they

6888.44 --> 6894.32
are the non-local holographic angular

6891.719 --> 6894.32
manifestation

6895.04 --> 6898.199
I really like saying

6898.8 --> 6906.2390000000005
that I know you know I

6902.079 --> 6909.32
do but I'm doing it anyway cuz I can and

6906.239 --> 6912.919999999999
I I'm the person that basically brought

6909.32 --> 6916.159
that conception to the table like on the

6912.92 --> 6919.04
internet in the

6916.159 --> 6923.799999999999
world probably for the first

6919.04 --> 6926.48
time widely regarded as ridiculous and

6923.8 --> 6926.4800000000005
magically

6927.36 --> 6935.598999999999
Fantastical people might have even

6931.04 --> 6939.159
bumped into the notion of it but then

6935.599 --> 6942.639
under fear of world peer pressure

6939.159 --> 6945.119
disregarded it discarded it because they

6942.639 --> 6946.84
wouldn't want to be known as the guy

6945.119 --> 6949.839999999999
that came up with that thing that

6946.84 --> 6949.84
everybody wants to

6950.28 --> 6954.239
reject so that's why I'm doing

6959.119 --> 6965.5199999999995
also people tend to bring ideas to the

6962.079 --> 6970.48
table for pragmatic reasons because they

6965.52 --> 6974.1990000000005
can use the conception to bridge

6970.48 --> 6976.839999999999
issues that are out there and by

6974.199 --> 6979.5599999999995
declaring the celestial lights

6976.84 --> 6982.84
angular non-local holographic angular

6979.56 --> 6985.320000000001
manifestations it does not exactly solve

6982.84 --> 6988.719
certain problems that are out there it

6985.32 --> 6992.28
actually creates more problems and more

6988.719 --> 6994.679
confusion but at least it's honest about

6992.28 --> 6996.5199999999995
the absolute missing

6994.679 --> 7000.639
evidence

6996.52 --> 7005.040000000001
of the celestial lights being anything

7000.639 --> 7005.04
physical in any actual

7009.56 --> 7016.56
location and by the way that was kind of

7013.4 --> 7019.92
interesting in the three body

7016.56 --> 7024.719
problem that they were like

7019.92 --> 7025.679
oh radial signal distances to planets

7024.719 --> 7028.599
and the

7025.679 --> 7031.76
Sun which is highly

7028.599 --> 7034.639
sugges and I think that that is just

7031.76 --> 7038.119000000001
completely made up but I'd like to have

7034.639 --> 7038.119
more evidence of that

7039.04 --> 7045.5199999999995
right I have a suspicion that people

7043.079 --> 7047.639
that do that that involve supposedly

7045.52 --> 7049.56
with what would be like the setti

7047.639 --> 7052.679
program

7049.56 --> 7055.84
setti and sending signals to supposed

7052.679 --> 7055.84
other planets or other

7057.0 --> 7063.32
galaxies I'm suspecting that in some way

7061.199 --> 7065.239
whether they're directly involved or

7063.32 --> 7067.48
whether they have like Gatekeepers that

7065.239 --> 7072.959999999999
play on

7067.48 --> 7077.638999999999
them there has to be Foul Play there has

7072.96 --> 7080.76
to be foul play in this cuz what are you

7077.639 --> 7082.32
bouncing it off you're bouncing a signal

7080.76 --> 7087.079000000001
of a light in the

7082.32 --> 7087.079
sky I'd like to

7088.36 --> 7096.96
see the raw data on that I suspect there

7092.199 --> 7099.759999999999
is like a real organized file play on on

7096.96 --> 7099.76
that entire

7100.76 --> 7105.88
conception it's basically the same issue

7103.36 --> 7109.639
I had with the whole notion of the Moon

7105.88 --> 7111.2390000000005
signal rebounds the claim of that right

7109.639 --> 7114.56
people like oh but you could just get a

7111.239 --> 7117.4
ham radio you do that oh see it works

7114.56 --> 7120.679
oh people do it on video except you

7117.4 --> 7122.199
don't even see the moon in The View when

7120.679 --> 7125.679
you do

7122.199 --> 7128.4
that and just oh a reading on a computer

7125.679 --> 7130.679
there's no turning it on or off there's

7128.4 --> 7133.0
no variation in the directions just like

7130.679 --> 7134.4
oh see there is a rebound oh really how

7133.0 --> 7137.28
do you know that's of the

7134.4 --> 7139.5599999999995
Moon are you very manipulating the

7137.28 --> 7143.44
direction of the signal in order

7139.56 --> 7146.639
to Bounce It Off the moon and blatantly

7143.44 --> 7149.28
not Bounce It Off the Moon by letting

7146.639 --> 7152.92
the signal go past the moon none of

7149.28 --> 7156.119
these things are backed there's no

7152.92 --> 7157.92
backing to any of this hey stop and

7156.119 --> 7160.119
traffic and rest that wow that's been

7157.92 --> 7162.96
ages how are you

7160.119 --> 7165.679
doing so

7162.96 --> 7169.8
I'd want to see more raw data and to be

7165.679 --> 7172.159
fair I want like I get this feeling like

7169.8 --> 7175.0
I want to be like a committee that just

7172.159 --> 7178.199
basically comes in and it's like

7175.0 --> 7182.32
okay you're now going to demonstrate

7178.199 --> 7185.879999999999
these things live on Live

7182.32 --> 7188.4
recorded scenario and I will scrutinize

7185.88 --> 7190.2390000000005
these processes I will scrutinize

7188.4 --> 7192.719
whether you are

7190.239 --> 7194.879999999999
committing fraud

7192.719 --> 7199.32
by claiming these things or if you're

7194.88 --> 7201.719
actually honestly sending signals and

7199.32 --> 7203.679
varing manipulating the direction in

7201.719 --> 7205.639
order to prove that it is really

7203.679 --> 7208.0
happening that there's really a physical

7205.639 --> 7212.0
thing out there that you're bouncing

7208.0 --> 7212.0
this off I want to test

7214.04 --> 7221.239
it but what these organizations ever

7217.639 --> 7223.159000000001
have that allowed to be done right who's

7221.239 --> 7224.48
in control of those organizations who

7223.159 --> 7227.079
sponsors

7224.48 --> 7229.638999999999
them I wouldn't be surprised if there's

7227.079 --> 7232.5599999999995
like Jesuit connections there that's

7229.639 --> 7234.32
like yeah no no we tell them exactly how

7232.56 --> 7237.04
this works they just follow the

7234.32 --> 7239.36
procedures would not be surprised if

7237.04 --> 7239.36
that

7242.0 --> 7248.199
happening first time not blocked in

7244.079 --> 7248.199
years I haven't blocked you

7249.96 --> 7255.88
forever but maybe some weird Shadow

7253.0 --> 7259.119
Banning had happened

7255.88 --> 7259.119
rad it's

7263.92 --> 7268.8
weird why so

7266.36 --> 7272.5199999999995
suspicious

7268.8 --> 7274.84
because there is no actual evidence that

7272.52 --> 7278.320000000001
these Celestial lights are physical

7274.84 --> 7280.92
objects in space and if they are not

7278.32 --> 7284.0
actually physical objects in space then

7280.92 --> 7289.2390000000005
how could you have timed signal

7284.0 --> 7289.239
reboun from the presupposed physical

7289.88 --> 7295.719
object there's no visual indications

7292.719 --> 7295.719
whatsoever they are

7295.76 --> 7301.84
physical yeah outer space is fake

7298.719 --> 7304.079
there's no physical bodies out there

7301.84 --> 7306.360000000001
like how could we even perceive any of

7304.079 --> 7308.36
them when we have to be within a

7306.36 --> 7311.0
physical container in order to have gas

7308.36 --> 7313.679
pressure the way we do it's stable

7311.0 --> 7316.119
stabilized gas G pressure gradient could

7313.679 --> 7319.96
only happen if we were within a physical

7316.119 --> 7321.4
container in order to create that gas

7319.96 --> 7324.36
pressure

7321.4 --> 7328.44
gradient that physical container does

7324.36 --> 7330.079
not have room to have physical bodies

7328.44 --> 7332.598999999999
floating up

7330.079 --> 7334.199
there and even if they were outside of

7332.599 --> 7336.96
the container well that would mean that

7334.199 --> 7338.638999999999
any radio signal would literally bounce

7336.96 --> 7342.76
off the

7338.639 --> 7345.639
container before it would ever get to

7342.76 --> 7348.320000000001
the presupposed physical body out there

7345.639 --> 7352.52
there's too many

7348.32 --> 7359.32
issues and I suspect fraud as I did with

7352.52 --> 7359.320000000001
the the general claim of a moon signal

7361.679 --> 7366.4400000000005
rebounds and nobody's actually ever done

7365.0 --> 7368.32
it

7366.44 --> 7371.4
right my

7368.32 --> 7374.44
dedicated YouTube video like totally

7371.4 --> 7378.28
dedicated to that one setup has been out

7374.44 --> 7382.4
there for several years now without a

7378.28 --> 7385.8
single response to it nobody has done it

7382.4 --> 7388.04
even though everything that I proposed

7385.8 --> 7391.2390000000005
that should be done in order to actually

7388.04 --> 7395.079
make the claim solid with

7391.239 --> 7398.159
proof like is not that

7395.079 --> 7402.5199999999995
complicated you need a couple of

7398.159 --> 7406.28
cameras radio transmitter a computer

7402.52 --> 7409.52
that can basically record that and show

7406.28 --> 7411.28
it in a graph as it is happening live

7409.52 --> 7414.2390000000005
and then how you would do it it's not

7411.28 --> 7417.5199999999995
that complicated like a person that has

7414.239 --> 7420.5599999999995
like a million doll budget could easily

7417.52 --> 7422.8
do that I think and there's plenty of

7420.56 --> 7426.4800000000005
people out there that have that and I

7422.8 --> 7428.8
mean wouldn't you want to be the guy

7426.48 --> 7431.799999999999
that puts those damn flat earthers in

7428.8 --> 7434.84
their place forever and just really

7431.8 --> 7437.84
demonstrates it

7434.84 --> 7441.2390000000005
life life varying and manipulating the

7437.84 --> 7442.679
signal rebound but nobody's done it

7441.239 --> 7445.32
there's no

7442.679 --> 7447.76
response it's only the same stupid

7445.32 --> 7450.36
videos of just oh look we're having a

7447.76 --> 7453.52
moon signal rebounds look on the screen

7450.36 --> 7456.639
see it's rebounding and not even showing

7453.52 --> 7458.360000000001
the moon in the sky in the video shot

7456.639 --> 7460.719
it's so

7458.36 --> 7463.719
absurd

7460.719 --> 7463.719
yeah

7470.119 --> 7474.159
it can go through the

7472.239 --> 7477.959999999999
container

7474.159 --> 7481.119
um because how do you know there is

7477.96 --> 7481.119
anything outside of the

7485.719 --> 7492.559
container the point is did Gary do music

7488.8 --> 7496.599
I'd like to see the Raw

7492.559 --> 7501.679
data or better a

7496.599 --> 7501.679
demonstration live of these

7501.719 --> 7506.32
processes like oh here we got the device

7504.32 --> 7508.679
that aims it at the celestial body we're

7506.32 --> 7513.28
going to like measure the radio signal

7508.679 --> 7516.8
rebounds it's like okay let's do that

7513.28 --> 7520.36
first you're going to aim it

7516.8 --> 7523.76
off and then you're like going to step

7520.36 --> 7526.96
by step make it closer to a direct dead

7523.76 --> 7533.360000000001
on Reckoning on the celestial body and I

7526.96 --> 7533.36
want to see the raw data as it's coming

7537.4 --> 7544.0
in yeah the funny thing is that well

7541.719 --> 7546.44
something like what I just described is

7544.0 --> 7549.76
literally

7546.44 --> 7553.96
happening in the three body

7549.76 --> 7557.8
problem like that made it to me

7553.96 --> 7560.84
like Damn it like ah I hated that they

7557.8 --> 7562.719
did that because I want to do that I

7560.84 --> 7565.92
want to do something I want to actually

7562.719 --> 7568.639
be there like they made it look so real

7565.92 --> 7570.84
but is it real or is it just another

7568.639 --> 7572.639
reinforcement of the presupposition that

7570.84 --> 7574.96
it's all real that's the whole problem

7572.639 --> 7579.4400000000005
with scientism they do this [ __ ] all the

7574.96 --> 7581.119
time they make fiction look really real

7579.44 --> 7583.558999999999
and then they never actually do it in

7581.119 --> 7583.558999999999
reality

7590.0 --> 7596.239
so yeah I'd like to see a definitive

7593.8 --> 7599.679
demonstration

7596.239 --> 7604.28
live and where I can scrutinize like I

7599.679 --> 7605.159
can where I get like an absolute right

7604.28 --> 7608.92
to

7605.159 --> 7611.679
say what is this I want to look in this

7608.92 --> 7614.1990000000005
could you please open up this computer I

7611.679 --> 7617.1990000000005
want to take a look inside I want to see

7614.199 --> 7620.079
how the wires are routed I want to know

7617.199 --> 7623.839999999999
everything about how this is done I want

7620.079 --> 7623.84
to see it demonstrated

7624.159 --> 7630.079
live until I am

7627.52 --> 7634.4800000000005
satisfied that whatever they're

7630.079 --> 7637.48
doing yields this weird radio signal

7634.48 --> 7640.718999999999
rebound specifically tied into a

7637.48 --> 7643.32
Celestial body which would then not

7640.719 --> 7645.639
prove it it's all outer space and

7643.32 --> 7648.639
planets no it would prove that there is

7645.639 --> 7648.639
a Celestial

7649.159 --> 7652.879999999999
mystery that's what it would

7653.679 --> 7660.52
prove and that it's not just all being

7657.679 --> 7664.28
faked that there are mysterious things

7660.52 --> 7666.96
out there that basically give food to

7664.28 --> 7669.48
heliocentric thinkers cuz if there

7666.96 --> 7672.0
really is a signal rebound

7669.48 --> 7676.119
somehow then I really can

7672.0 --> 7679.92
blame outer space and Planet Believers

7676.119 --> 7682.36
for like having hope that there is

7679.92 --> 7684.84
something right and that they're not

7682.36 --> 7687.48
just faking it to to get rid of those

7684.84 --> 7687.4800000000005
pesky flat

7693.4 --> 7697.159
earthers that's what this is

7700.28 --> 7704.5199999999995
about yeah I want to know what is real

7703.32 --> 7708.719
and what is

7704.52 --> 7712.400000000001
faked and then the consequences of

7708.719 --> 7716.36
it if it's not faked they're out in the

7712.4 --> 7719.638999999999
open then it just becomes raw data and a

7716.36 --> 7722.44
mystery like what is then going on how

7719.639 --> 7725.4800000000005
could you further test

7722.44 --> 7727.678999999999
this and where's my damn icus test you

7725.48 --> 7730.44
know I want to see this I want to see

7727.679 --> 7732.8
the IUS test I want to see somebody

7730.44 --> 7737.28
attempting to take a high altitude

7732.8 --> 7740.8
balloon and make it go into the sun I

7737.28 --> 7742.159
want to see the angular size of the

7740.8 --> 7746.679
apparent

7742.159 --> 7749.598999999999
sundisk grow bigger with approach I want

7746.679 --> 7754.119
to see that cuz that would be some form

7749.599 --> 7757.079
of proof of a proximity of actually it

7754.119 --> 7759.839999999999
being some kind of thing in ukian space

7757.079 --> 7762.119
that seems to grow bigger an

7759.84 --> 7765.96
indication that perspec

7762.119 --> 7769.759999999999
applies that it is perhaps not a

7765.96 --> 7773.4
non-local hologram in every

7769.76 --> 7776.52
respect that perhaps the sun can be

7773.4 --> 7779.28
approached and isn't always at the edge

7776.52 --> 7779.280000000001
of everybody's

7781.04 --> 7787.159
Vision how high do you think the sun is

7784.44 --> 7790.558999999999
well according to dis Earth is

7787.159 --> 7792.879999999999
it's what is it 3,000 mil High that's

7790.559 --> 7795.1990000000005
how the angles

7792.88 --> 7798.4800000000005
up

7795.199 --> 7801.04
so it's definitely worth testing worth

7798.48 --> 7801.04
trying it

7805.88 --> 7812.96
out and if you can't really approach it

7809.28 --> 7815.0
like that then at least you could do a

7812.96 --> 7818.0
raw test with

7815.0 --> 7822.719
it like have a bit of a a radi

7818.0 --> 7825.639
transmitter on that balloon that sees if

7822.719 --> 7828.8
maybe there is some kind of response

7825.639 --> 7832.96
from sending a signal towards the

7828.8 --> 7835.4800000000005
sun especially closer without all the

7832.96 --> 7837.559
atmosphere being in the way right

7835.48 --> 7840.4
there's all kinds of

7837.559 --> 7843.599
opportunities that will come out of

7840.4 --> 7843.598999999999
attempting an ioras

7850.239 --> 7855.62
test

7852.57 --> 7855.62
[Music]

7859.92 --> 7864.4
all right take a two minute break be

7862.119 --> 7864.4
right

7880.239 --> 7883.239
back

7940.159 --> 7943.159
for

7968.079 --> 7973.119
I'm

7969.8 --> 7973.119000000001
back all right

7982.239 --> 7987.558999999999
so that gives you some interesting

7984.84 --> 7987.559
things to think

7993.679 --> 7999.159
about yeah and by the way how amazing

7996.96 --> 8002.28
would it be if somebody actually sent up

7999.159 --> 8007.119
a high altitude balloon

8002.28 --> 8007.119
right during the Neve

8008.76 --> 8014.719
Eclipse how amazing would it be if

8010.96 --> 8017.559
somebody could get a closer up

8014.719 --> 8019.679
look of the eclipse like from high

8017.559 --> 8023.4800000000005
altitude

8019.679 --> 8026.119
see like aim like it would be difficult

8023.48 --> 8028.839999999999
to aim it at the right

8026.119 --> 8031.159
location but to actually see the eclipse

8028.84 --> 8037.119000000001
more up close and even potentially be

8031.159 --> 8037.119
able to take a look downward

8037.559 --> 8044.52
partially from a higher Vantage Point

8041.52 --> 8046.52
we've seen some Eclipse video from an

8044.52 --> 8049.040000000001
airplane which was already pretty

8046.52 --> 8052.719
amazing but what if you could do that

8049.04 --> 8052.719
even higher what would that look

8052.92 --> 8057.4400000000005
like isn't that wouldn't that be

8055.4 --> 8060.0
interesting like what would it look up

8057.44 --> 8060.0
like up

8060.04 --> 8063.04
closer

8065.639 --> 8073.28
would for example rahu or

8069.8 --> 8076.559
K2 block out the

8073.28 --> 8079.92
Sun so much that you like don't even see

8076.559 --> 8079.92
the ring of fire around

8081.239 --> 8086.079
it or would it literally be exactly the

8084.88 --> 8090.04
same

8086.079 --> 8093.599
site which is would we much more of a

8090.04 --> 8096.5199999999995
Telltale piece of evidence that that it

8093.599 --> 8098.76
really isn't on local hologram because

8096.52 --> 8102.1990000000005
if it's really physical object blocking

8098.76 --> 8104.559
something then the distance to it should

8102.199 --> 8108.199
make it a different

8104.559 --> 8111.679
sight 3,000 mile high balloon I'm not

8108.199 --> 8111.678999999999
necessarily that high Steve

8119.159 --> 8124.48
Bronson as high as you can get get it

8122.28 --> 8124.48
who

8124.679 --> 8130.719
knows any type of

8127.32 --> 8130.719
attempt would be

8130.88 --> 8136.559
interesting and just see will the

8134.04 --> 8139.8
angular size of the

8136.559 --> 8139.8
sun be

8146.04 --> 8152.92
bigger why can balloons go not that high

8149.639 --> 8152.92
definitely not

8177.51 --> 8182.92
[Music]

8179.92 --> 8182.92
for

8186.52 --> 8190.280000000001
huh guess I'm going to make

8190.84 --> 8195.559
the two and a half hour mark anyway

8209.84 --> 8212.84
today

8233.559 --> 8238.8
thanks thank youil interesting piece of

8239.12 --> 8246.160000000002
information yeah it's not

8242.84 --> 8246.16
that's not super high

8269.84 --> 8272.84
though

8280.599 --> 8284.319
right

8281.92 --> 8287.319
anyhow again it would be interesting if

8284.319 --> 8290.88
somebody tried a high altitude balloon

8287.319 --> 8290.88
test during the

8291.28 --> 8296.599
eclipse I haven't seen anybody that's

8293.599 --> 8299.76
even attempted anything like that now

8296.599 --> 8302.559
would be a great time to to test

8299.76 --> 8305.24
that

8302.559 --> 8306.639
but yeah unfortunately I won't be able

8305.24 --> 8309.84
to do

8306.639 --> 8309.839999999998
that of

8312.96 --> 8317.24
course we'll see if somebody does

8329.719 --> 8332.719
it

8339.519 --> 8343.519
right so I think I'm going to round out

8341.359 --> 8343.519
the

8353.2 --> 8359.599
show yeah thanks everyone for coming I

8357.04 --> 8362.080000000002
hope you like this show if you did then

8359.599 --> 8364.16
please don't forget to R it up and if

8362.08 --> 8366.559
you haven't already subscribe to my

8364.16 --> 8369.2
channel hit the Bell notification so you

8366.559 --> 8371.96
know when I'm going live just normally 2

8369.2 --> 8374.28
p.m Amsterdam time every day and please

8371.96 --> 8376.0
also do support me through the PayPal

8374.28 --> 8378.12
and the patreon that would be much

8376.0 --> 8380.24
appreciated and can still really use the

8378.12 --> 8382.679
support so please keep it coming and

8380.24 --> 8386.76
thanks to for those that have donated

8382.679 --> 8391.319
today really help me out and get some

8386.76 --> 8393.56
new bread thanks to that need a rocket

8391.319 --> 8395.96
hey send a rocket that's fine too you

8393.56 --> 8398.08
want to do that sure if you think you

8395.96 --> 8403.479
can get higher that

8398.08 --> 8405.08
way right anyway please support me uh

8403.479 --> 8407.88
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth

8405.08 --> 8411.64
early bird number

8407.88 --> 8415.0
19006 on a Wednesday hope to see you all

8411.64 --> 8418.96
then have a nice day out there and until

8415.0 --> 8418.96
the next video keep it
