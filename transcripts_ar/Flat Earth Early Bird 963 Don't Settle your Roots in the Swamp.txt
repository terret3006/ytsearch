90.72 --> 93.6
clouded

91.52 --> 95.28
but it was very sunny this morning

93.6 --> 98.83999999999999
actually

95.28 --> 102.479
it still is in between clouded moments

98.84 --> 104.96000000000001
but yeah there's very little wind

102.479 --> 106.159
and it's it's much warmer than it was

104.96 --> 110.32
yesterday

106.159 --> 110.32000000000001
obviously to me

112.64 --> 120.719
so yes looks like it's a

116.159 --> 120.71900000000001
warm sunday so far

123.68 --> 129.20000000000002
yesterday did actually rain very softly

126.96 --> 132.16
here and there

129.2 --> 135.04
during the evening but not real

132.16 --> 139.28
significant rain

135.04 --> 139.28
but yeah today it's nice and sunny again

140.84 --> 143.84
right

144.08 --> 148.64000000000001
ah hello agm first in chat

148.8 --> 159.59900000000002
that's warm over there as well good

157.76 --> 160.79999999999998
yeah there was also another party going

159.599 --> 163.35999999999999
on by the way

160.8 --> 165.76000000000002
this time not so close by but much

163.36 --> 165.76000000000002
further

166.08 --> 171.36
to the south still very loud and they

169.28 --> 173.76
were just playing the same dutch slagger

171.36 --> 173.76000000000002
music

177.44 --> 185.84
so yes there's been people enjoying

180.64 --> 185.83999999999997
the summer and having parties i think

189.12 --> 192.8
did they keep me awake nope

194.239 --> 200.8
no what during the afternoon not up

198.159 --> 200.79999999999998
until late

201.84 --> 206.64000000000001
like late afternoon evening and then

204.64 --> 213.83999999999997
they kind of stopped somewhere

206.64 --> 213.83999999999997
i don't remember when

214.4 --> 216.72
right

223.599 --> 232.07999999999998
so it is sunday the 25th

228.159 --> 236.07999999999998
of july 2021

232.08 --> 239.76000000000002
and i'll be having an hour show today

236.08 --> 240.48000000000002
at least things get rolling a bit

239.76 --> 243.51899999999998
because

240.48 --> 244.0
in retrospect yeah yesterday show there

243.519 --> 247.68
was

244.0 --> 250.159
just a lot of quiet

247.68 --> 250.799
mostly in chat and it only got rolling

250.159 --> 253.2
really

250.799 --> 254.87900000000002
in the last moment and then it even died

253.2 --> 258.639
down again i don't know why

254.879 --> 258.639
it's just whatever's in the air

259.68 --> 264.24
but yeah i hope to keep things rolling

261.919 --> 264.24
because

266.479 --> 270.88
otherwise yeah it becomes a little stale

272.0 --> 278.479
anyway yeah i managed to put together

276.08 --> 279.84
a quick title card didn't really get to

278.479 --> 284.15999999999997
put any text on it

279.84 --> 284.15999999999997
i hope that animekin was up

284.32 --> 290.88
and he's very good at doing that

287.759 --> 292.47900000000004
very quickly but yeah at least i did get

290.88 --> 294.56
a title card because

292.479 --> 296.0
i thought this morning that i it was

294.56 --> 298.96
just gonna be

296.0 --> 301.28
no time card at all but then i thought

298.96 --> 301.28
of this

306.96 --> 311.59999999999997
it's a good nice esoteric thought don't

309.919 --> 314.96
settle your roots in the swamp

311.6 --> 317.36
with a very wide variety of meanings

314.96 --> 319.59999999999997
attached to it esoterically

317.36 --> 322.16
a lot of people will be very familiar

319.6 --> 324.32000000000005
with by now

322.16 --> 326.8
they paid any sort of attention in the

324.32 --> 329.28
last five years

326.8 --> 329.28000000000003
at least

333.6 --> 337.36
right and depending on who's going to be

335.6 --> 340.56
in chat

337.36 --> 343.36
i might talk about that some more but

340.56 --> 346.4
yeah i don't really talk all that well

343.36 --> 351.039
about esoterics unless there is a

346.4 --> 351.039
feedback like unless there's

351.6 --> 355.28000000000003
unless there's a connection with

353.199 --> 357.52000000000004
somebody in that moment i know it's

355.28 --> 360.0
listening

357.52 --> 362.4
it's kind of that's how my chemistry

360.0 --> 362.4
works

362.96 --> 366.15999999999997
everybody must have noticed that by now

365.84 --> 369.28
like

366.16 --> 370.40000000000003
you just put me in silence and i'll be

369.28 --> 372.63899999999995
kind of silent and

370.4 --> 374.4
i'll be fine with that too it might be a

372.639 --> 374.8
little yeah when you're doing a live

374.4 --> 376.88
show

374.8 --> 378.56
that's not preferable but in general

376.88 --> 381.84
like i do just fine

378.56 --> 381.84
in silence

383.199 --> 387.12
it's kind of funny to compare it to when

385.36 --> 389.36
i was a teen when there was

387.12 --> 391.919
a lot of noise around me most of the

389.36 --> 394.319
time i was playing music always

391.919 --> 398.0
getting pumped up like that i don't

394.319 --> 398.0
really do that anymore i seek out

398.08 --> 403.68
calm a lot more because i guess that

401.44 --> 407.36
back then i was always like shy for

403.68 --> 409.759
excitement and now the excitement is

407.36 --> 410.40000000000003
really already there through figuring

409.759 --> 412.639
things out

410.4 --> 415.67999999999995
except now it's much closer to heart so

412.639 --> 419.68
now i actually seek out the peace

415.68 --> 421.919
more because peace also means i don't

419.68 --> 423.28000000000003
get confronted with these things i now

421.919 --> 428.0
know

423.28 --> 428.0
are basically not all that good news

432.0 --> 437.84
but yeah i do the best when i get some

434.84 --> 437.84
feedback

438.24 --> 451.28000000000003
because then the energy connects

442.08 --> 453.52
and then it rolls out much more smoothly

451.28 --> 455.919
allows me to up my game in the moment

453.52 --> 455.919
anyway

456.4 --> 460.56
hope some more people will join the chat

462.0 --> 465.84
there's 13 watching at least

477.919 --> 482.56
i made some really a big pot of chili

480.08 --> 482.56
yesterday

482.639 --> 486.96000000000004
lurkers yeah probably uh there's a whole

485.919 --> 489.84
bunch of people

486.96 --> 492.0
that i i once banned that are just like

489.84 --> 494.0
unforgivable towards me

492.0 --> 496.96
and i think that some of them might be

494.0 --> 496.96
secretly obsessed

499.759 --> 504.0
like i bump into them in like other

501.84 --> 506.08
hangouts and [ __ ] like over at dells who

504.0 --> 510.639
doesn't really ban anyone and

506.08 --> 516.3199999999999
brandon they just show up like stupid

510.639 --> 516.32
oh hi it's been a long time

518.24 --> 522.8
but yeah it's all fine i don't mind a

521.039 --> 525.919
lot of people will get banned

522.8 --> 525.919
and they failed the test

526.08 --> 532.5600000000001
right and it's it's an ongoing test

530.16 --> 534.7199999999999
they can still succeed if they just get

532.56 --> 537.5999999999999
over the original issues

534.72 --> 538.48
and a lot of people here now in chat

537.6 --> 542.24
have

538.48 --> 544.48
done that right there's been plenty of

542.24 --> 547.92
times when agm and me

544.48 --> 551.04
when we really got the yeah pretty

547.92 --> 554.0799999999999
irritated by each other

551.04 --> 555.8389999999999
during my live shows even and

554.08 --> 558.08
i thought at some point like this guy is

555.839 --> 559.9200000000001
never gonna make it

558.08 --> 561.44
like he has no control over himself

559.92 --> 564.56
whatsoever but

561.44 --> 568.399
yeah my

564.56 --> 570.3199999999999
signals over time have been received and

568.399 --> 573.44
he's proven that

570.32 --> 575.9200000000001
because he is i literally

573.44 --> 577.0400000000001
call it a better person than he was say

575.92 --> 581.12
two years ago

577.04 --> 585.279
it's more grip on himself and i really

581.12 --> 589.04
appreciate that from a pragmatic

585.279 --> 589.04
standpoint but also yeah it's

589.279 --> 592.16
it's admirable

594.08 --> 599.279
and so yeah even though somebody might

597.519 --> 602.399
seem like they can never

599.279 --> 605.6
ever overcome the things

602.399 --> 609.12
that were the obstacle over time yeah

605.6 --> 609.76
they might surprise you and that's why i

609.12 --> 612.48
never

609.76 --> 613.8389999999999
like grow permanently hostile to people

612.48 --> 616.839
unless

613.839 --> 619.6
they've done things that are so ugly to

616.839 --> 621.6
me and like motivation wise

619.6 --> 623.76
unforgivable too like when you get

621.6 --> 625.76
really ugly

623.76 --> 627.4399999999999
even when you're not super passionate to

625.76 --> 629.519
me right that sort of thing

627.44 --> 632.0
because people get passionate people get

629.519 --> 634.079
riled up and they go way too far

632.0 --> 636.24
right and they can get really nasty all

634.079 --> 638.88
of a sudden

636.24 --> 640.5600000000001
i have this too in my own way i try to

638.88 --> 641.76
keep it under control when it happens

640.56 --> 645.92
but it's like almost

641.76 --> 646.72
impossible but that's natural in a way

645.92 --> 649.68
right and

646.72 --> 651.36
you can reflect on that afterward and

649.68 --> 652.399
then try to correct things if you went

651.36 --> 654.72
too far you

652.399 --> 655.92
apologize for it etc etc that's all

654.72 --> 660.24
human behavior

655.92 --> 663.5999999999999
but when somebody gets really ugly

660.24 --> 666.24
while they're really calm right

663.6 --> 667.2
then they just overstep certain moral

666.24 --> 670.64
boundaries that

667.2 --> 672.32
i can never condone with

670.64 --> 674.48
like and even if they like suddenly

672.32 --> 674.8000000000001
metaphorically turned into a holy man

674.48 --> 676.8000000000001
and

674.8 --> 679.4399999999999
like commended all their ways and did

676.8 --> 682.64
almost like perfect

679.44 --> 685.36
unless they'd really shine and

682.64 --> 686.0
like blatantly transform with their

685.36 --> 688.72
actions

686.0 --> 690.16
and their attitude which would be like a

688.72 --> 693.519
miraculous change

690.16 --> 697.4399999999999
change if they just became normal

693.519 --> 697.44
then still i wouldn't forgive them

698.32 --> 702.1600000000001
because they did damage they're in the

700.079 --> 705.279
negative through their immoral

702.16 --> 708.88
behavior because it wasn't natural

705.279 --> 711.36
and they didn't correct it right

708.88 --> 712.959
but that all depends so it is all about

711.36 --> 714.9590000000001
like hey how are you behaving

712.959 --> 716.3199999999999
are you getting passionate and then

714.959 --> 719.4399999999999
going overkill

716.32 --> 722.1600000000001
yeah that's not good but it is still

719.44 --> 725.12
kind of natural and depending on what

722.16 --> 727.76
happens after it dies down

725.12 --> 730.0
it's doable it's something that

727.76 --> 732.3199999999999
everybody could live with

730.0 --> 734.959
it kind of even gives a little character

732.32 --> 738.399
to the social situation in a bit

734.959 --> 741.68
unless it becomes too often and all that

738.399 --> 745.36
right but if you get

741.68 --> 748.88
totally nasty when you're not

745.36 --> 751.12
like getting a rush of feelings

748.88 --> 752.8
and you still go nasty because you think

751.12 --> 756.32
that's okay

752.8 --> 759.4399999999999
that's when you're absolutely just

756.32 --> 759.9200000000001
that's yeah while you sin it feels like

759.44 --> 761.44
sin

759.92 --> 762.959
when you do that it's like you don't

761.44 --> 767.2790000000001
respect

762.959 --> 768.959
the sensitivities of of morality

767.279 --> 770.8389999999999
and what you shouldn't be doing bad

768.959 --> 773.8389999999999
behavior etc

770.839 --> 773.839
right

776.079 --> 779.279
but there's i guess plenty of people out

778.16 --> 781.92
there that just

779.279 --> 781.92
don't care

782.48 --> 786.0790000000001
they got trapped in terrible behavior

784.639 --> 788.16
they don't get out of it

786.079 --> 789.1999999999999
they go somewhere else and they continue

788.16 --> 791.6
doing

789.2 --> 792.88
that including all the errors and the

791.6 --> 794.639
nastiness

792.88 --> 796.88
and they just don't get over it like

794.639 --> 798.5600000000001
they don't even see a reason why they

796.88 --> 801.04
should

798.56 --> 803.1199999999999
right they don't even consider it as an

801.04 --> 806.399
obstacle they had to have to get over

803.12 --> 808.88
it just except it is there as a

806.399 --> 810.48
permanent thing

808.88 --> 813.279
and then they don't get anywhere they

810.48 --> 816.72
don't that it severely hinders

813.279 --> 819.8389999999999
a person's development when you don't

816.72 --> 823.839
recognize your mistakes

819.839 --> 827.6800000000001
you don't overcome your mistake then you

823.839 --> 830.9590000000001
the mistake becomes you

827.68 --> 833.279
right remember me saying that

830.959 --> 834.3199999999999
it ties into everything like that is

833.279 --> 836.56
just

834.32 --> 840.0
esoteric structure it's virtual

836.56 --> 843.279
structure that applies to so much

840.0 --> 845.92
even like the whole forgetfulness effect

843.279 --> 846.8
of believing in illusion everything fits

845.92 --> 849.4399999999999
into it

846.8 --> 851.5999999999999
like it is a virtual esoteric model that

849.44 --> 854.8800000000001
i've basically been constructing

851.6 --> 858.48
and i'm good at it i really am i

854.88 --> 858.48
i see what i do

860.639 --> 865.36
and i can be open for discussion and

863.44 --> 868.0790000000001
inquiry even detailed inquiry

865.36 --> 870.0
even people that are trying to like

868.079 --> 871.5999999999999
reverse engineer what i've talked ab

870.0 --> 872.56
what i've been talking about for

871.6 --> 874.639
themselves

872.56 --> 877.5999999999999
they try to like write it down or make a

874.639 --> 877.6
schematic and then

877.76 --> 881.12
feed that back to me then i can even

880.56 --> 883.279
talk

881.12 --> 884.5600000000001
about it with them like because this is

883.279 --> 887.04
not something i just

884.56 --> 887.04
made up

890.88 --> 899.8389999999999
this is a serious project to me

894.079 --> 899.8389999999999
anyway hey

900.56 --> 905.199
yes when you watch immoral channels it

903.12 --> 906.9590000000001
tends to rub off on you and that also

905.199 --> 911.4399999999999
counts for

906.959 --> 915.68
fear porn and for

911.44 --> 918.1600000000001
typical false blaming suggestions

915.68 --> 920.3199999999999
it's like some bunch of criminals and

918.16 --> 920.3199999999999
you

920.72 --> 928.24
and you quickly compact

925.12 --> 932.639
the guilty party into a wider group

928.24 --> 932.639
right known as discrimination

935.6 --> 941.9200000000001
etc and it does rub off on you

939.44 --> 943.839
the bad behavior when not corrected rubs

941.92 --> 946.3199999999999
off on you because

943.839 --> 948.399
it is being dealt with if as if it's

946.32 --> 951.6800000000001
normal

948.399 --> 954.0
without a natural feeling response

951.68 --> 956.399
afterward that says like wait maybe that

954.0 --> 957.519
was wrong maybe i should get more

956.399 --> 961.12
specific

957.519 --> 964.16
maybe i should correct this quickly

961.12 --> 964.16
so that it won't

965.199 --> 969.279
the weight of it won't pierce through

967.6 --> 972.24
the hole

969.279 --> 972.959
it won't crush through it right because

972.24 --> 976.24
the longer

972.959 --> 978.16
you let it slide eventually it you will

976.24 --> 980.48
have no more grip

978.16 --> 982.639
to correct the mistake like it's all

980.48 --> 987.44
behavioral details and it all

982.639 --> 992.8
matters especially when it comes to

987.44 --> 996.9590000000001
like fractal thinking

992.8 --> 1000.639
long-term information assimilation

996.959 --> 1003.279
all these details matter because

1000.639 --> 1004.88
in the future all of that becomes even

1003.279 --> 1010.639
more critical

1004.88 --> 1014.079
so the sooner you get it all right

1010.639 --> 1019.12
the better because that will enhance

1014.079 --> 1019.12
its learning value for into the future

1020.48 --> 1025.839
right taking it all very seriously right

1023.68 --> 1027.9189999999999
it is the assumption that eventually

1025.839 --> 1029.6
potentially everybody in the world will

1027.919 --> 1038.7990000000002
be able to just

1029.6 --> 1052.08
take a look through my channel

1038.799 --> 1052.8799999999999
hello john john good to see you oh

1052.08 --> 1055.12
that's

1052.88 --> 1056.48
by the way is really good to hear agm

1055.12 --> 1058.7199999999998
because i knew

1056.48 --> 1060.64
you were like really into super

1058.72 --> 1061.679
attention grabby channels and you were

1060.64 --> 1064.16
constantly

1061.679 --> 1067.2
forwarding that to me and in a way i

1064.16 --> 1069.2
appreciate that

1067.2 --> 1071.039
you're kind of giving me a glimpse into

1069.2 --> 1071.76
what you're into right by what you

1071.039 --> 1075.36
recommend

1071.76 --> 1077.12
you kind of prove like the things that

1075.36 --> 1080.1599999999999
you're okay with

1077.12 --> 1083.039
the frequency like

1080.16 --> 1084.96
everything you like it kind of proves

1083.039 --> 1088.72
your frequency

1084.96 --> 1090.799
if right anyway and you were very much

1088.72 --> 1093.84
into kind of bad videos

1090.799 --> 1097.28
and i didn't even warn you about that

1093.84 --> 1097.28
and it's really good that you

1098.32 --> 1102.08
started to actually feel it

1103.36 --> 1109.84
and step back as you say it's really

1105.28 --> 1109.84
good stuff

1118.0 --> 1124.4
right but in a way you see agm

1121.36 --> 1127.28
like it might seem as a flaw as an

1124.4 --> 1129.3600000000001
addiction for some reason like you

1127.28 --> 1133.44
haven't been drawn into that but

1129.36 --> 1136.799
on the long run every time you succeed

1133.44 --> 1140.0
overcoming obstacles and moving on then

1136.799 --> 1143.28
everything you did and went through

1140.0 --> 1145.28
becomes like a little micro library of

1143.28 --> 1147.84
that sort of experience

1145.28 --> 1149.84
so potentially depending on how far you

1147.84 --> 1153.28
grow

1149.84 --> 1155.9189999999999
that you did that and typically

1153.28 --> 1156.559
like those types of videos gives you an

1155.919 --> 1159.8400000000001
insight

1156.559 --> 1160.72
in the psychological and emotional

1159.84 --> 1163.1999999999998
mechanics

1160.72 --> 1165.1200000000001
of somebody that typically gets drawn

1163.2 --> 1169.039
into that and addicted to that

1165.12 --> 1173.36
so it gives you this extra experience

1169.039 --> 1175.12
that you can actually practically use

1173.36 --> 1176.799
to compare with other people's

1175.12 --> 1179.28
experience

1176.799 --> 1179.9189999999999
and perhaps give them some insights on

1179.28 --> 1183.76
it

1179.919 --> 1186.0
because you overcame doing that

1183.76 --> 1188.08
but you got a good glimpse and

1186.0 --> 1190.4
experience what that's like

1188.08 --> 1192.08
and the pitfalls and so you understand

1190.4 --> 1194.0
it all much better than somebody that

1192.08 --> 1197.28
might be freshly into such a thing and

1194.0 --> 1197.28
doesn't realize it right

1202.159 --> 1205.44
two steps for one step back yeah but

1203.76 --> 1207.84
that always works like that

1205.44 --> 1207.8400000000001
right

1211.36 --> 1220.559
sometimes you don't see this step back

1214.159 --> 1223.44
and sometimes you do

1220.559 --> 1226.48
sometimes it's just the unwillingness

1223.44 --> 1226.48
like of the ego

1226.64 --> 1230.3200000000002
to even move forward i've experienced

1229.36 --> 1233.6
that a lot

1230.32 --> 1236.8799999999999
in the past it's not so much now

1233.6 --> 1238.3999999999999
that like i would know like this is the

1236.88 --> 1240.48
right thing to do this would lead to

1238.4 --> 1241.8400000000001
that that's probably a more constructive

1240.48 --> 1245.76
road

1241.84 --> 1248.48
but i just didn't want to do it

1245.76 --> 1250.559
like no i want something completely

1248.48 --> 1253.28
different something that i

1250.559 --> 1254.8799999999999
cannot fully foresee it was really weird

1253.28 --> 1259.6
of me

1254.88 --> 1259.6000000000001
right very restless

1260.32 --> 1264.3999999999999
i was really trying to find a way

1262.159 --> 1266.72
through on like this higher metaphysical

1264.4 --> 1266.72
level

1267.36 --> 1271.28
digging in my deeper dimensions and it's

1270.48 --> 1274.88
like no i

1271.28 --> 1278.3999999999999
actually want to get like not be

1274.88 --> 1280.72
tied down to the change chains of the

1278.4 --> 1280.72
earth

1282.159 --> 1287.2
that was the esoteric motivation behind

1286.4 --> 1291.679
it now

1287.2 --> 1294.4
what i'm left with is very weird because

1291.679 --> 1295.1200000000001
from an earthly perspective it just

1294.4 --> 1298.159
looks like

1295.12 --> 1301.28
wow i didn't really

1298.159 --> 1302.24
accomplish a lot did i i mean i wrote i

1301.28 --> 1305.2
wrote a book here and

1302.24 --> 1307.36
i had like my own private little

1305.2 --> 1309.6000000000001
projects

1307.36 --> 1311.6789999999999
but i haven't really financially

1309.6 --> 1313.4399999999998
progressed a lot although i have right

1311.679 --> 1316.72
now because i have this show and i have

1313.44 --> 1316.72
you guys to support me

1317.44 --> 1321.28
it just looks like wow this guy didn't

1319.36 --> 1323.6789999999999
really do a lot

1321.28 --> 1325.6
from kind of a an informed neutral

1323.679 --> 1327.919
outsider perspective that did

1325.6 --> 1330.1589999999999
get informed about okay this is how his

1327.919 --> 1333.1200000000001
life went

1330.159 --> 1333.8400000000001
this is where he's at but when i then

1333.12 --> 1337.6
remember

1333.84 --> 1340.8799999999999
like why i made the choices that i did

1337.6 --> 1340.8799999999999
there was a legitimate

1341.52 --> 1347.36
like motivation behind it and it still

1345.039 --> 1351.039
stands really

1347.36 --> 1353.12
like it even refers to the title of my

1351.039 --> 1356.24
show right now

1353.12 --> 1359.1999999999998
because i had a lot of swamp room

1356.24 --> 1360.08
to set my roots in back then i was

1359.2 --> 1362.32
surrounded by

1360.08 --> 1363.84
swamp everybody said just put your roots

1362.32 --> 1365.9189999999999
in there come on just put

1363.84 --> 1367.36
get on you need to get on with your life

1365.919 --> 1370.64
you need to get somewhere

1367.36 --> 1372.8799999999999
do it do it do it do it literally

1370.64 --> 1375.8400000000001
and people didn't even know it was a

1372.88 --> 1375.8400000000001
swamp

1376.48 --> 1380.32
right i'm talking about early alex jones

1380.0 --> 1385.52
time

1380.32 --> 1385.52
like in between 2001 and 2000

1386.84 --> 1389.84
11.

1395.84 --> 1400.6399999999999
and weirdly enough to feed it back to

1398.32 --> 1404.799
what you said about your

1400.64 --> 1404.7990000000002
experience learning experience agm

1405.2 --> 1410.4
that i lived through this weird kind of

1408.0 --> 1414.159
detached

1410.4 --> 1417.679
way has given me

1414.159 --> 1420.7990000000002
practical experience on how to deal with

1417.679 --> 1423.679
very stressful seductions in not

1420.799 --> 1423.679
engaging

1423.84 --> 1428.559
guess what's going on in the world right

1426.32 --> 1428.559
now

1428.64 --> 1435.6000000000001
the whole world is caught now

1432.0 --> 1440.4
locked in and being seduced

1435.6 --> 1440.3999999999999
to engage in something that's very bad

1440.96 --> 1448.88
hi i'm arwen i have

1444.32 --> 1451.6789999999999
pretty much 10 years straight and more

1448.88 --> 1452.3200000000002
maybe 20 years straight experience in

1451.679 --> 1456.96
how

1452.32 --> 1459.279
not to put your roots in the swamp

1456.96 --> 1461.1200000000001
when it seems like there's only swamp

1459.279 --> 1464.96
everywhere

1461.12 --> 1468.08
it's easy swamp access everywhere

1464.96 --> 1470.799
isn't that just funny that that

1468.08 --> 1470.799
big weight

1471.279 --> 1475.44
that i've been carrying around pretty

1473.2 --> 1478.4
much up until i went on to youtube

1475.44 --> 1480.799
of like i failed in life oh i failed

1478.4 --> 1483.8400000000001
really because i thought that

1480.799 --> 1485.36
right like i couldn't escape that people

1483.84 --> 1487.84
didn't even tell me

1485.36 --> 1490.4799999999998
because i would radiate yet like yeah i

1487.84 --> 1494.3999999999999
know i know i know

1490.48 --> 1495.52
but now all of that certainly has an

1494.4 --> 1498.4
unexpected

1495.52 --> 1499.84
but maybe not as unexpected as i even

1498.4 --> 1503.44
consciously know

1499.84 --> 1506.08
advantage because i have

1503.44 --> 1508.24
experience on how to actually not put

1506.08 --> 1510.8799999999999
your roots in that swamp and that's a

1508.24 --> 1514.4
challenge that currently

1510.88 --> 1518.4
pretty much the entire world is facing

1514.4 --> 1521.76
and the swamp is now even more poisonous

1518.4 --> 1528.64
than it was 20 years ago when i already

1521.76 --> 1531.84
decided not to put it in there

1528.64 --> 1531.8400000000001
isn't that just interesting

1532.559 --> 1539.279
right every disadvantage

1535.919 --> 1540.5590000000002
eventually grows into an advantage of

1539.279 --> 1545.84
some sort it is

1540.559 --> 1548.559
by design of god nothing goes to waste

1545.84 --> 1548.559
not really

1552.4 --> 1561.52
every failure has an advantage

1557.679 --> 1561.52
but only if you grow

1562.08 --> 1569.1999999999998
only if you actually go

1565.279 --> 1572.88
forward up the staircase and not down it

1569.2 --> 1573.76
then every failure has an advantage of

1572.88 --> 1576.0800000000002
some sort

1573.76 --> 1577.6
over somebody that would have not had

1576.08 --> 1580.0
that failure

1577.6 --> 1580.0
really

1582.84 --> 1585.84
right

1588.799 --> 1593.6
i believe in many ways that failure is

1591.279 --> 1596.559
actually like the cornerstone of our

1593.6 --> 1600.1589999999999
experience the purpose of it

1596.559 --> 1605.6789999999999
is to try and fail and learn and try

1600.159 --> 1605.679
again or choose to try something else

1607.44 --> 1612.0800000000002
and then when you succeed you move to

1609.919 --> 1615.919
that success

1612.08 --> 1619.36
but every failure in the past still

1615.919 --> 1621.5200000000002
is something to reflect upon every time

1619.36 --> 1623.4399999999998
and that's also why the older you get if

1621.52 --> 1627.84
you're really a big learner the harder

1623.44 --> 1629.44
it becomes to actually make mistakes

1627.84 --> 1641.84
but you don't really need to make them

1629.44 --> 1641.8400000000001
anymore anyway

1642.08 --> 1645.4399999999998
all right it's you could compare it

1643.76 --> 1647.6
roughly to

1645.44 --> 1649.76
another formula and that is the more

1647.6 --> 1653.36
power you attain whether it's like

1649.76 --> 1657.12
magical or like authority

1653.36 --> 1660.4799999999998
or money more power you gain

1657.12 --> 1669.84
the harder it becomes to not

1660.48 --> 1669.84
use it it weighs on you

1674.399 --> 1685.6
hmm oh yeah there was a troll in chat

1683.2 --> 1685.6000000000001
wow

1693.039 --> 1697.12
dude that guy was certainly on with the

1696.08 --> 1700.96
straw man

1697.12 --> 1703.52
frisbee world what frisbee world

1700.96 --> 1704.48
like he seems to forget what channel

1703.52 --> 1706.799
he's on

1704.48 --> 1710.72
maybe it's because i no longer have the

1706.799 --> 1712.96
original title cards of the rectangular

1710.72 --> 1715.279
looping realm

1712.96 --> 1716.96
that he yeah this guy currently is

1715.279 --> 1719.36
overlooking that

1716.96 --> 1725.8400000000001
i don't actually believe in this frisbee

1719.36 --> 1725.84
world you're strawmanning with

1727.279 --> 1731.84
invisible sky wizard what

1733.76 --> 1736.96
or maybe he just read through my dnd

1736.08 --> 1739.279
book and is

1736.96 --> 1742.08
trying to blurt out some kind of halfway

1739.279 --> 1744.96
inspired nonsense

1742.08 --> 1744.96
we'll see him back

1748.399 --> 1756.399
oh hello by the way steamy traveler

1752.96 --> 1757.679
do you have one year or five year plan

1756.399 --> 1761.1999999999998
for your channel in your life

1757.679 --> 1767.8400000000001
no well sort of it's

1761.2 --> 1767.8400000000001
it's kind of ethereal though

1788.88 --> 1796.24
what i i

1792.559 --> 1799.039
wow this guy's on autopilot

1796.24 --> 1799.039
maybe it's ed

1801.279 --> 1804.159
it's ridiculous

1804.799 --> 1809.84
anyway hello deaf daffy

1820.84 --> 1823.84
duck

1834.84 --> 1837.84
hmm

1839.039 --> 1847.279
right but overall i can hand you a basic

1844.399 --> 1850.0
five year plan or one year at least

1847.279 --> 1852.32
steamy traveler and that is that

1850.0 --> 1854.24
i consider this my profession and

1852.32 --> 1855.84
everything i state about what i do the

1854.24 --> 1860.96
psychology

1855.84 --> 1864.48
the language the

1860.96 --> 1867.039
or even presentation skills like

1864.48 --> 1869.2
i must enhance them and i have times

1867.039 --> 1872.24
where i'm like

1869.2 --> 1874.48
like almost panicky about like i must

1872.24 --> 1876.08
progress that so that's part of my

1874.48 --> 1879.1200000000001
five-year plan is to become

1876.08 --> 1881.1999999999998
good enough that whatever is causing

1879.12 --> 1883.6789999999999
this disconnection with the rest of the

1881.2 --> 1886.799
world in a lot of ways

1883.679 --> 1890.799
to undo that because

1886.799 --> 1894.48
i do want wider reach i do want

1890.799 --> 1896.72
to have interviews even on on much wider

1894.48 --> 1900.08
platforms

1896.72 --> 1902.96
right i do not want to be isolated

1900.08 --> 1903.84
not really like i can't survive that hey

1902.96 --> 1908.72
i've got

1903.84 --> 1908.72
like 20 years of training on that right

1916.159 --> 1923.0390000000002
but i don't want to settle with just

1919.76 --> 1925.36
doing this and being isolated forever

1923.039 --> 1927.2
until i'm dead and then it's just erased

1925.36 --> 1930.399
and everybody can't forget about it

1927.2 --> 1931.679
that's an idea that i find absolutely

1930.399 --> 1935.84
unacceptable

1931.679 --> 1935.8400000000001
and for that i need to connect more

1936.72 --> 1943.6000000000001
i want the world to take my ideas

1939.76 --> 1946.72
seriously or go at it

1943.6 --> 1948.08
go and tell me how i'm wrong and not by

1946.72 --> 1952.799
being a stupid

1948.08 --> 1955.1999999999998
sock squirting with straw man [ __ ]

1952.799 --> 1956.08
about flat earth and the globe not that

1955.2 --> 1960.64
sort of thing but

1956.08 --> 1960.6399999999999
actual more heart-to-heart

1960.84 --> 1965.6
criticism tell me then

1963.44 --> 1968.0
if there are things about me that are

1965.6 --> 1971.519
just unacceptable it's like no

1968.0 --> 1974.64
sorry you have some good ideas but we

1971.519 --> 1978.0
cannot accept this and that

1974.64 --> 1978.7990000000002
if you want to be associated with our

1978.0 --> 1981.279
platform

1978.799 --> 1983.279
right that part i'm not getting any

1981.279 --> 1987.519
communication

1983.279 --> 1991.279
right people should absolutely know i

1987.519 --> 1994.159
exist absolutely cannot be avoided

1991.279 --> 1997.36
like on the scene everybody knows i

1994.159 --> 1999.679
exist i have a daily show

1997.36 --> 2002.08
i have my own unique ideas

1999.679 --> 2005.3600000000001
well-developed ideas i've

2002.08 --> 2005.84
done predictions five years like in the

2005.36 --> 2009.519
very

2005.84 --> 2010.32
very start that have become universally

2009.519 --> 2013.519
understood

2010.32 --> 2016.24
and adapted to now yeah

2013.519 --> 2016.799
i should be taken very seriously in this

2016.24 --> 2019.919
field

2016.799 --> 2024.08
very very seriously and i take myself

2019.919 --> 2027.2
very seriously i just don't understand

2024.08 --> 2028.32
why people are not connecting so could

2027.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
you please

2028.32 --> 2033.84
tell me what it is

2034.24 --> 2040.88
that makes you

2037.279 --> 2043.679
what your platform think like nah

2040.88 --> 2046.88
i'm just gonna let arwyn do his thing i

2043.679 --> 2048.56
i don't need to

2046.88 --> 2052.0
it's like nothing i can contribute

2048.56 --> 2052.0
there's nothing i have to ask

2052.879 --> 2056.159
or i don't want to associate i want to

2055.119 --> 2061.119
know i

2056.159 --> 2064.7200000000003
really really want to know and not from

2061.119 --> 2064.7200000000003
some shitty troll

2067.44 --> 2071.44
yeah i know about the trolls i know

2069.28 --> 2073.2000000000003
there's gamma pieces of [ __ ] out there

2071.44 --> 2076.7200000000003
and i know what they do

2073.2 --> 2080.3199999999997
i don't care you are irrelevant

2076.72 --> 2082.3199999999997
permanently nothing you have

2080.32 --> 2083.3590000000004
that contributes to anything you only

2082.32 --> 2086.8
distract

2083.359 --> 2089.52
only pull away from good moments

2086.8 --> 2090.8790000000004
and that's why i ban you and nobody

2089.52 --> 2094.079
cares but you

2090.879 --> 2094.0789999999997
and your squirt buddies

2095.599 --> 2099.2000000000003
but for the more serious people i want

2097.76 --> 2103.6800000000003
feedback

2099.2 --> 2107.68
give it to me i mean it

2103.68 --> 2109.9199999999996
what you'd rather talk about ranty now

2107.68 --> 2112.48
who's literally sending out trolls to do

2109.92 --> 2113.52
that [ __ ] oh you'll talk about [ __ ]

2112.48 --> 2116.16
ranty

2113.52 --> 2117.359
when he is just a blatant idiotic

2116.16 --> 2120.56
traitor

2117.359 --> 2124.24
oh you'll talk about that [ __ ]

2120.56 --> 2124.24
every single time sure

2125.119 --> 2130.7200000000003
i've never heard anybody talk about me

2127.92 --> 2135.599
except for nathan oakley and the panel

2130.72 --> 2135.5989999999997
on his show and ballbusters

2136.079 --> 2140.6400000000003
like nothing i say matters in any sort

2138.32 --> 2143.839
of way sometimes i feel

2140.64 --> 2146.8799999999997
right oh yeah my show gets a little

2143.839 --> 2148.96
rusty maybe a little slow

2146.88 --> 2150.48
and not enough rage win moments which

2148.96 --> 2154.32
i'm trying to prevent

2150.48 --> 2157.119
to do that because it it doesn't help

2154.32 --> 2158.2400000000002
right i've overcome it i don't need it

2157.119 --> 2161.76
anymore

2158.24 --> 2163.2799999999997
it's not something i build towards it's

2161.76 --> 2166.6400000000003
not something i find

2163.28 --> 2168.8
favorable as part of a standard act for

2166.64 --> 2172.4
what i do

2168.8 --> 2175.76
i want feedback from

2172.4 --> 2180.32
real people i want

2175.76 --> 2183.92
my name to be recognized for what i do

2180.32 --> 2186.7200000000003
and for what i've contributed

2183.92 --> 2187.599
and for what you freaking hate about me

2186.72 --> 2189.68
if there's some

2187.599 --> 2192.56
annoying little thing that's just like

2189.68 --> 2194.0
oh if only arwyn didn't have that you

2192.56 --> 2198.839
know

2194.0 --> 2201.839
tell me bastards tell

2198.839 --> 2201.839
me

2217.52 --> 2221.359
i talk about a lot of people on the

2220.4 --> 2224.4
scene

2221.359 --> 2228.0
all the time i don't

2224.4 --> 2231.6800000000003
just [ __ ] on them like a gamma bastard

2228.0 --> 2232.8
or patronize them i do honest analysis

2231.68 --> 2235.9199999999996
and i always

2232.8 --> 2236.48
if i can try to pull in the good side

2235.92 --> 2238.079
like this

2236.48 --> 2241.28
yeah they're promising they're still

2238.079 --> 2246.1600000000003
doing good things right when i do it

2241.28 --> 2249.6800000000003
why aren't people doing

2246.16 --> 2250.64
the return favor except for nathan

2249.68 --> 2252.96
oakley

2250.64 --> 2255.44
who's like the only one that's actually

2252.96 --> 2258.88
stuck to my side

2255.44 --> 2262.16
and i really appreciate i really do

2258.88 --> 2262.1600000000003
and he's not perfect

2262.56 --> 2266.56
oh no he's not at least he'd give me

2266.16 --> 2271.839
some

2266.56 --> 2271.839
damn recognition

2273.2 --> 2276.64
and i don't mean you guys in my chat

2276.079 --> 2279.119
like

2276.64 --> 2280.0789999999997
the regular guys in my chat that are

2279.119 --> 2282.96
really like

2280.079 --> 2284.2400000000002
the viewers you know you what you do is

2282.96 --> 2287.68
awesome i appreciate

2284.24 --> 2291.68
that why aren't platform

2287.68 --> 2295.04
streamers with

2291.68 --> 2297.5989999999997
a wider knowledge with a wider re why

2295.04 --> 2298.96
nobody nobody seems to give a [ __ ] about

2297.599 --> 2302.1600000000003
this

2298.96 --> 2305.04
right and hey i'm not like dell

and i believe him that he really doesn't

2330.24 --> 2335.68
care

2332.079 --> 2339.119
i have something to contribute

2335.68 --> 2342.7999999999997
to potentially the entire world

2339.119 --> 2346.4
term projects wider obstacle

2342.8 --> 2348.4

for almost three years

2383.2 --> 2390.64
i'd like some connection please

2386.48 --> 2392.48
with other serious platformers out there

2390.64 --> 2394.96
i would really appreciate some

2392.48 --> 2398.64
recognition

2394.96 --> 2401.52
some verbal advertisement like i give

2398.64 --> 2403.2799999999997
to everybody that i appreciate and i've

2401.52 --> 2404.24
even failed to mention a whole bunch of

2403.28 --> 2406.88
people

2404.24 --> 2408.64
simply because i don't fully understand

2406.88 --> 2410.4
them yet

2408.64 --> 2412.0789999999997
when i get into watching something

2410.4 --> 2415.359
somebody

2412.079 --> 2417.28
eventually i will start to trust

2415.359 --> 2418.96
how they function what they are what

2417.28 --> 2421.2000000000003
they're doing and then we'll talk about

2418.96 --> 2421.2
them

2422.16 --> 2431.92
and i will advertise for them

2426.4 --> 2431.92
i would like to see somebody reciprocate

2436.839 --> 2439.839
this

2442.72 --> 2446.48
yeah yeah i do feel i'm entitled for

2445.04 --> 2448.72
some recognition how about the

2446.48 --> 2452.16
recognition

2448.72 --> 2455.68
that in 2000 freaking 15

2452.16 --> 2457.5989999999997
i was in chats everywhere on the first

2455.68 --> 2460.8799999999997
videos telling people

2457.599 --> 2464.4
the sun is holographic the sun

2460.88 --> 2467.119
is holographic the sun is holographic

2464.4 --> 2469.96
it's not actually a place it doesn't

2467.119 --> 2473.28
exist it moves with

2469.96 --> 2476.4
2015 yeah

2473.28 --> 2480.3190000000004
i can pretty much say i'm the one

2476.4 --> 2482.48
that has made that thing a thing

2480.319 --> 2484.8
that understanding brought it to

2482.48 --> 2489.839
everybody

2484.8 --> 2493.2000000000003
everybody yeah now i didn't

2489.839 --> 2494.24
create the idea i haven't been the first

2493.2 --> 2496.48
to even have

2494.24 --> 2499.1189999999997
glimpses of that in their own

2496.48 --> 2502.8
conceptions that's gone back like

2499.119 --> 2506.88
in the in the last century right

2502.8 --> 2510.1600000000003
but when the flat earth started to boost

2506.88 --> 2511.04
on youtube and everywhere i made that a

2510.16 --> 2513.7599999999998
thing

2511.04 --> 2515.44
very quickly and i've held on to it from

2513.76 --> 2519.5200000000004
the start

2515.44 --> 2521.599
knowing this is real this is true

2519.52 --> 2523.68
i understood things on a mechanical

2521.599 --> 2527.04
intuitive level

2523.68 --> 2530.56
very quickly i recognized like this

2527.04 --> 2532.56
is not what we've been told it is

2530.56 --> 2534.24
and not even about a supposed distance

2532.56 --> 2535.2
no this is not an object this is

2534.24 --> 2537.359
holographic

2535.2 --> 2540.16
yeah i'd like some recognition for

2537.359 --> 2543.2
pretty much being the first person

2540.16 --> 2544.72
in the flat earth movement on social

2543.2 --> 2548.839
media

2544.72 --> 2551.839
to point that out and hold on to that

2548.839 --> 2551.839
permanently

2554.4 --> 2568.4
that's right

2564.72 --> 2568.3999999999996
yeah i was bringing that forward

2569.119 --> 2575.52
when like jaren

2572.72 --> 2576.8799999999997
and david weiss were still going up

2575.52 --> 2580.48
against what is it

2576.88 --> 2583.04
this guy non-sequitur or something

2580.48 --> 2583.68
very very early like they were like oh

2583.04 --> 2585.68
no it's

2583.68 --> 2587.9199999999996
that close look the angles work out no

2585.68 --> 2590.319
no it's that far away blah blah blah

2587.92 --> 2591.359
i was like no it's holographic it isn't

2590.319 --> 2594.079
anywhere

2591.359 --> 2595.839
you're both wrong and everybody was like

2594.079 --> 2598.079
ah that freaking arguing again

2595.839 --> 2599.599
like what does he mean he's just

2598.079 --> 2603.8390000000004
trolling right

2599.599 --> 2606.2400000000002
people thought that no i wasn't trolling

2603.839 --> 2608.24
it was very serious and people now know

2606.24 --> 2613.1189999999997
that

2608.24 --> 2621.839
after five six years

2613.119 --> 2621.839
i'd like some recognition for that

2624.319 --> 2628.88
rectangular looping theory right but i

2627.28 --> 2632.1600000000003
didn't invent that

2628.88 --> 2634.4
steamy traveler i appreciate that i

2632.16 --> 2635.68
am kind of like the one that is publicly

2634.4 --> 2638.8
live streaming

2635.68 --> 2640.24
holding on to that but it's just a part

2638.8 --> 2644.079
of cosmogeny now

2640.24 --> 2646.72
like i i take a grip of every model

2644.079 --> 2649.76
even the globe and even build within the

2646.72 --> 2654.24
globe conception so

2649.76 --> 2656.5600000000004
right but technically

2654.24 --> 2657.9199999999996
free energy and now called square earth

2656.56 --> 2662.319
cosmology

2657.92 --> 2665.6800000000003
was the one that that showed me that

2662.319 --> 2669.2799999999997
opened that door of realization

2665.68 --> 2670.0789999999997
and that was a little later now was it

2669.28 --> 2672.0
no it was

2670.079 --> 2673.119
actually quite so but he was there very

2672.0 --> 2675.76
early

2673.119 --> 2676.8
he had those videos in 2015 and i was

2675.76 --> 2680.8
like whoa

2676.8 --> 2684.48
holy [ __ ] there's this is it there's

2680.8 --> 2684.48
something really important here

2684.56 --> 2688.0789999999997
when everybody was like yeah but it's

2686.24 --> 2689.4399999999996
not really about that it's about the

2688.079 --> 2693.2000000000003
four dimensional

2689.44 --> 2695.119
light which was also kind of the thing

2693.2 --> 2696.64
that square with cosmology was talking

2695.119 --> 2701.119
about with

2696.64 --> 2704.319
those visuals right

2701.119 --> 2706.56
but yes i've definitely expanded and

2704.319 --> 2707.7599999999998
detailed out the rectangular looping

2706.56 --> 2710.319
model

2707.76 --> 2710.3190000000004
concept

2712.56 --> 2717.68
but yeah that's only a model basically

2715.839 --> 2721.7599999999998
or a wide variety of model

2717.68 --> 2722.319
options i understand that people don't

2721.76 --> 2726.48
really

2722.319 --> 2730.0
care to reference that all the time

2726.48 --> 2730.0
i get that right

2730.48 --> 2735.119
even like from the nathan oakley camp

2733.599 --> 2737.599
it's like yeah but it's a model it's

2735.119 --> 2737.599
useless

2738.64 --> 2742.56
right so even from my own i get that but

2741.28 --> 2747.52
the holographic

2742.56 --> 2750.56
sun no no no it is

2747.52 --> 2753.7599999999998
wider recognized now yeah

2750.56 --> 2755.839
people understand it better

2753.76 --> 2756.96
when you put them on the spot like but

2755.839 --> 2760.0789999999997
you don't really

2756.96 --> 2762.0
have proof for an actual distance and

2760.079 --> 2763.8390000000004
thank you nathan oakley for making it a

2762.0 --> 2767.119
housekeeping question basically the

2763.839 --> 2771.599
cornerstone of the entire concept

2767.119 --> 2774.56
that i brought to the scene i claim that

2771.599 --> 2776.079
people recognize that right yes they're

2774.56 --> 2777.2
not going to say holographic sound

2776.079 --> 2789.8390000000004
holographic sound

2777.2 --> 2789.839
but they recognize yes yeah

2792.24 --> 2798.8799999999997
right but yes i am definitely

2796.079 --> 2802.079
a champion of rectangular looping model

2798.88 --> 2805.839
conceptions for the earth

2802.079 --> 2809.599
but it's just to me it's it's a drop

2805.839 --> 2813.04
in in a giant pool of

2809.599 --> 2817.839
like cosmogeny it's just all the

2813.04 --> 2817.839
possibilities from all angles

2823.599 --> 2827.44
it's like the quantum model from what we

2827.04 --> 2830.48
know

2827.44 --> 2835.119
absolutely up to

2830.48 --> 2838.079
every conceivable possible thing

2835.119 --> 2840.0
that it could turn out to be yeah that's

2838.079 --> 2845.8390000000004
what i do

2840.0 --> 2845.839
that's my cosmogenist

2850.64 --> 2854.96
would the holographic sun also assume a

2853.119 --> 2857.2000000000003
holographic universe

2854.96 --> 2858.2400000000002
that's a trick question but since you

2857.2 --> 2862.72
already

2858.24 --> 2862.72
put a quotation around universe yes

2862.8 --> 2868.8
the holographic sun is part of the

2866.079 --> 2869.119
celestial lights all of them and they

2868.8 --> 2873.119
are

2869.119 --> 2877.359
all holographic sun

2873.119 --> 2881.119
moon oh yeah oh yeah it too

2877.359 --> 2884.839
planets stars falling star

2881.119 --> 2888.7200000000003
light phenomena and even like the

2884.839 --> 2892.24
ultraviolet weird

2888.72 --> 2893.1189999999997
sort of ufo things that might be visible

2892.24 --> 2896.9599999999996
if you have like a

2893.119 --> 2900.6400000000003
infrared or is it a special sort of

2896.96 --> 2902.2400000000002
light camera yeah it's all holographic

2900.64 --> 2905.52
it's all part of the globe of the

2902.24 --> 2907.9199999999996
heavens as i called it

2905.52 --> 2911.359
the celestial lights they're all

2907.92 --> 2914.4
holographic none of them are actually

2911.359 --> 2929.839
light originating from a specific

2914.4 --> 2929.839
point in euclidean space

2932.24 --> 2935.7599999999998
so all of the light manifestations from

2934.64 --> 2939.04
the heavens all of it

2935.76 --> 2942.96
including the sun right including those

2939.04 --> 2946.5589999999997
seeming beams touch down on us

2942.96 --> 2949.2
they all manifest uniquely to the

2946.559 --> 2950.559
observer to the position because if

2949.2 --> 2954.3999999999996
you're in another position

2950.559 --> 2954.4
they do not manifest the same

2954.64 --> 2958.16
it's really weird because it's

2956.4 --> 2961.839
holographic

2958.16 --> 2965.2
every observer has a unique

2961.839 --> 2966.7999999999997
holographic print of the setting of the

2965.2 --> 2968.3999999999996
globe of the heavens how it is in

2966.8 --> 2970.8
relation to their position

2968.4 --> 2971.92
and that is what we see so every

2970.8 --> 2975.3590000000004
observer

2971.92 --> 2985.839
sees a unique light play

2975.359 --> 2985.839
of the heavens unique

3017.76 --> 3023.44
dude the light manifestations have an

3020.4 --> 3026.88
origin in non-euclidean space

3023.44 --> 3031.359
there is no non-euclidean space

3026.88 --> 3033.52
that's only mathematical no

3031.359 --> 3035.359
like manifestations there is no

3033.52 --> 3039.52
non-euclidean space

3035.359 --> 3041.68
right that doesn't exist in reality

3039.52 --> 3043.7599999999998
unless there is some weird over

3041.68 --> 3045.5989999999997
dimensional thing going on but i can't

3043.76 --> 3049.92
prove that because i don't have any

3045.599 --> 3053.04
reach on it right there could be

3049.92 --> 3056.16
not time dimensional more

3053.04 --> 3057.839
dimensions like you have the third three

3056.16 --> 3061.5989999999997
dimensions

3057.839 --> 3065.359
like this this this and then you have

3061.599 --> 3069.119
the fourth dimension through

3065.359 --> 3072.48
right so like what a

3069.119 --> 3075.52
sphere is to a flat surface

3072.48 --> 3077.599
dimension wise

3075.52 --> 3079.68
that could be from the third dimension

3077.599 --> 3080.6400000000003
and over dimension the fourth dimension

3079.68 --> 3084.0
where it goes

3080.64 --> 3085.92
through it another depth through right

3084.0 --> 3089.839
that's the only way i can explain it so

3085.92 --> 3089.839
maybe if there is such a thing

3090.88 --> 3094.8
though we cannot physically prove it

3092.88 --> 3097.839
because physical

3094.8 --> 3100.319
things are three-dimensional maybe

3097.839 --> 3101.839
yes maybe it is coming from there from

3100.319 --> 3104.24
the over dimension

3101.839 --> 3106.16
it's even part of my earliest theories

3104.24 --> 3109.359
to try and explain

3106.16 --> 3111.7599999999998
on how the holographic sun

3109.359 --> 3112.96
where it is coming from i said yeah

3111.76 --> 3114.559
maybe it's coming from the over

3112.96 --> 3116.559
dimension

3114.559 --> 3117.599
yeah they said that even in my flatter

3116.559 --> 3119.44
talks

3117.599 --> 3122.0
i just don't talk about it anymore

3119.44 --> 3124.96
because i find

3122.0 --> 3126.72
the concepts of the dimensions through

3124.96 --> 3129.2
unproductive

3126.72 --> 3131.7599999999998
because i can never physically prove it

3129.2 --> 3134.16
i could experience something like that

3131.76 --> 3136.0
but i could never prove it you see and

3134.16 --> 3138.7999999999997
that's why i stepped away

3136.0 --> 3140.8
from the it as a concept to talk about

3138.8 --> 3142.2400000000002
it will always remain very science

3140.8 --> 3144.8
fictiony and elusive

3142.24 --> 3146.24
and i don't want to make that a part of

3144.8 --> 3148.559
my standard

3146.24 --> 3153.839
rhetoric the things that i talk about

3148.559 --> 3153.8390000000004
because i find it unproductive

3156.88 --> 3161.04
the looping portals themselves there is

3159.44 --> 3166.48
no looping portals

3161.04 --> 3169.839
steamy traveler there's no portals

3166.48 --> 3174.2400000000002
rectangular looping realm the realm is

3169.839 --> 3178.64
the portal there is no portal it's not a

3174.24 --> 3181.7599999999998
thing in space that serves as a gate

3178.64 --> 3184.8799999999997
the entire space is the portal

3181.76 --> 3188.559
it loops in on itself right i

3184.88 --> 3190.48
i resent the use of the word portal in

3188.559 --> 3193.52
context

3190.48 --> 3194.079
to the looping realm because there is no

3193.52 --> 3197.359
portal

3194.079 --> 3201.04
it is just the way the space is

3197.359 --> 3209.839
interconnecting there is no portal

3201.04 --> 3209.839
all of it is the portal

3214.32 --> 3219.76
[Music]

3216.64 --> 3220.96
hey adam meekin what's up and guns have

3219.76 --> 3223.8390000000004
never run rmp

3220.96 --> 3223.839
good to see you

3230.96 --> 3237.839
huh the chat is very vibrant now i like

3234.839 --> 3237.839
that

3248.839 --> 3251.839
hmm

3253.76 --> 3257.119
i guess i really just needed to make

3255.52 --> 3260.64
that stand and just

3257.119 --> 3260.6400000000003
share my dissatisfaction

3263.52 --> 3267.7599999999998
because it opened up a whole kind of

3265.359 --> 3267.7599999999998
energy

3268.0 --> 3271.92
check skype what

3274.98 --> 3278.799
[Music]

3276.839 --> 3282.16
ah

3278.799 --> 3285.119
nice thanks adam yeah i will use that

3282.16 --> 3285.1189999999997
that looks pretty good

3290.839 --> 3293.839
thanks

3298.88 --> 3301.119
cool

3304.4 --> 3307.839
all it right away

3329.2 --> 3338.0789999999997
oh it's too big

3332.559 --> 3338.079
it says it's too big wait i can

3338.48 --> 3341.92
i can do that in photoshop

3342.72 --> 3349.2
yeah but it looks good though

3345.839 --> 3363.839
wow you really did it weird font

3349.2 --> 3363.839
thingy there

3367.28 --> 3380.0
right yeah this should work

3376.4 --> 3382.64
okay let's try again i'm sorry for the

3380.0 --> 3382.64
delay guys

3384.24 --> 3392.24
there you go cool

3397.92 --> 3408.7200000000003
thanks for that huh

3405.119 --> 3408.7200000000003
okay what's going on in chat

3414.72 --> 3419.839
oh by the way my yeah steamy traveler

3417.68 --> 3420.24
you said yesterday that that stream had

3419.839 --> 3423.04
a

3420.24 --> 3425.4399999999996
coveted warning well apparently now yeah

3423.04 --> 3425.44
it does

3430.799 --> 3434.559
but that picture was just brilliant

3436.0 --> 3439.44
i'm really proud of it i i really hope

3438.88 --> 3441.6800000000003
they don't

3439.44 --> 3447.839
seriously strike it they shouldn't be

3441.68 --> 3447.839
able to

3452.0 --> 3460.16
am i gonna put adam on my payroll as a

3455.28 --> 3464.48
graphics designer

3460.16 --> 3466.0
well yeah just like i

3464.48 --> 3467.599
you know but it i do it through

3466.0 --> 3470.4
advertisement you know we all do

3467.599 --> 3470.4
advertisement

3470.72 --> 3476.0
so i will give him recognition for his

3473.44 --> 3480.319
work every time

3476.0 --> 3482.559
and i consider him as a friend i i don't

3480.319 --> 3484.88
like i couldn't pay him if he actually

3482.559 --> 3486.6400000000003
asked for a payment

3484.88 --> 3489.839
i can't pay for those skills i don't

3486.64 --> 3489.839
have that kind of money

3492.48 --> 3504.88
and he's doing it for the fun of it too

3502.72 --> 3506.24
am i a graphics designer for my day job

3504.88 --> 3509.839
no

3506.24 --> 3513.68
no this is my day job i'm a show host

3509.839 --> 3517.839
i'm a theorist i'm a public speaker

3513.68 --> 3517.839
at it on social media

3523.52 --> 3531.839
that's my day job

3537.839 --> 3542.72
right adam and and you know i do the

3540.079 --> 3542.7200000000003
same for you

3542.839 --> 3545.839
right

3548.96 --> 3555.599
like i provide free

3552.24 --> 3557.04
assistance in what i do if i could

3555.599 --> 3560.7200000000003
because i love doing that

3557.04 --> 3573.839
right like we're technically all doing

3560.72 --> 3573.839
this together

3580.72 --> 3587.839
oh we got some trigger trolls in chat

3597.44 --> 3601.839
we have measurements

3601.92 --> 3609.2000000000003
oh my god

3604.96 --> 3612.0
that's hilarious i wonder if he's

3609.2 --> 3613.5989999999997
genuinely a baller or if he's anti-flag

3612.0 --> 3614.0
he sounds kind of like he's a genuine

3613.599 --> 3616.48
ball he

3614.0 --> 3618.0
really thinks he's saying things that

3616.48 --> 3622.64
are all blatantly

3618.0 --> 3622.64
wrong inside out

3622.799 --> 3626.4
but an anti-flat earther wouldn't spend

3625.119 --> 3629.839
all their time doing

3626.4 --> 3629.839
saying such things

3633.02 --> 3636.15
[Music]

3637.68 --> 3643.1189999999997
just one piece of positive yeah it's

3639.76 --> 3647.44
called the black swan

3643.119 --> 3651.2000000000003
blacks one easy

3647.44 --> 3651.52
hey easy aquary why don't you say my

3651.2 --> 3657.839
name

3651.52 --> 3657.839
in chat got 30 seconds

3680.079 --> 3689.1600000000003
you got 10 seconds

3684.559 --> 3692.079
say my name easy a query in chat

3689.16 --> 3694.48
a-r-w-i-g-n say it in chat you got five

3692.079 --> 3694.48
seconds

3696.839 --> 3699.839
ah

3700.64 --> 3705.2799999999997
poor chat tackler get the [ __ ] up

3709.2 --> 3713.52
you should have you should have read the

3711.119 --> 3717.839
rules

3713.52 --> 3721.2
you don't get in my live chat and heckle

3717.839 --> 3724.16
my chat participants and have me

3721.2 --> 3725.5989999999997
on mute because when you do and i find

3724.16 --> 3728.72
out

3725.599 --> 3730.079
there's a specific rule for that because

3728.72 --> 3733.2
when i call

3730.079 --> 3733.8390000000004
you out as a chat participant to say my

3733.2 --> 3738.0789999999997
name

3733.839 --> 3741.119
within a certain time span and you don't

3738.079 --> 3741.92
then you get banned because i consider

3741.119 --> 3745.599
you a chat

3741.92 --> 3748.16
heckler that's there to disrupt

3745.599 --> 3751.039
the communication i have with my chat

3748.16 --> 3751.0389999999998
for the live show

3752.839 --> 3755.839
right

3773.599 --> 3777.0
but it is hilarious though to see them

3775.76 --> 3780.48
like

3777.0 --> 3780.48
conspiracy claims

3781.119 --> 3787.28
and we have measurements

3784.4 --> 3789.2000000000003
we have photographs we photographed the

3787.28 --> 3792.88
globe

3789.2 --> 3792.8799999999997
we got experiments

3793.76 --> 3799.28
like all the fallacies in a row oh it's

3796.4 --> 3803.44
it's amazing

3799.28 --> 3806.559
how many brutal errors they can put in a

3803.44 --> 3806.559
singular sentence

3806.72 --> 3810.72
it is kind of an art it is the art of

3808.88 --> 3813.119
the fallacy isn't it

3810.72 --> 3815.839
like how many fallacies can you put down

3813.119 --> 3825.839
in 200 characters

3815.839 --> 3825.839
it really is like a challenge to them

3846.079 --> 3850.799
what he was suicidal what are you

3848.24 --> 3850.799
talking about

3851.76 --> 3856.7990000000004
who was the chatrol

3863.839 --> 3867.839
i don't see it

3896.559 --> 3899.6800000000003
do you have a list of requirements that

3898.72 --> 3901.5989999999997
knee would

3899.68 --> 3904.8799999999997
need to be satisfied in order for to

3901.599 --> 3904.88
believe the earth is a globe

3906.839 --> 3909.839
uh

3909.92 --> 3914.64
well housekeeping questions flat earth

3912.16 --> 3919.44
debate housekeeping questions

3914.64 --> 3919.44
answers based in physical reality

3921.039 --> 3925.44
but yet it's no use like it's already

3924.24 --> 3929.0389999999998
kind of a false

3925.44 --> 3929.52
straw man question because you can't the

3929.039 --> 3931.44
earth

3929.52 --> 3932.799
is in the globe it doesn't matter what

3931.44 --> 3935.359
you say about it

3932.799 --> 3937.52
it's not a globe doesn't matter what you

3935.359 --> 3940.88
show me it's not a globe

3937.52 --> 3944.0
doesn't matter what you say

3940.88 --> 3946.2400000000002
in the sense of how the nature of

3944.0 --> 3949.2
physical reality functions

3946.24 --> 3950.0
doesn't matter whatever you think might

3949.2 --> 3953.5989999999997
make it

3950.0 --> 3955.52
look like a globe in my mind i know it's

3953.599 --> 3959.3590000000004
not a globe

3955.52 --> 3960.48
there is no list that would satisfy me

3959.359 --> 3965.839
the earth is a globe

3960.48 --> 3965.839
because i know it isn't

3987.28 --> 3992.079
curvature curvature curvature yeah well

3989.119 --> 3995.6800000000003
for starters

3992.079 --> 3998.2400000000002
at least some kind of a horizon

3995.68 --> 4001.1189999999997
geometric consistency with the globe how

3998.24 --> 4004.839
about that how about an actual horizon

4001.119 --> 4007.2000000000003
that is a geometric edge of the sphere

4004.839 --> 4010.48
earth

4007.2 --> 4010.48
like i want to see that

4010.72 --> 4018.319
you can never see it doesn't exist

4015.039 --> 4021.119
the horizon isn't geometric

4018.319 --> 4024.24
but yeah if it were well that would be

4021.119 --> 4026.96
very convincing the earth is a globe

4024.24 --> 4028.0789999999997
now i have weirdly enough very early

4026.96 --> 4032.079
seen

4028.079 --> 4033.6800000000003
like early computer animation renderings

4032.079 --> 4036.6400000000003
that were very cheap as not

4033.68 --> 4038.5589999999997
visually convincing at all of what it

4036.64 --> 4041.92
would look like

4038.559 --> 4045.52
and yeah there is absolutely no such

4041.92 --> 4045.52
imagery in reality

4046.079 --> 4049.44
because the earth is not a globe and

4047.599 --> 4052.799
it's

4049.44 --> 4056.079
hard enough to digitally

4052.799 --> 4059.7599999999998
represent it

4056.079 --> 4063.119
it's even harder to actually

4059.76 --> 4065.119
like in the moment live bend the visuals

4063.119 --> 4065.76
to make it look like that that's even

4065.119 --> 4068.559
harder

4065.76 --> 4071.3590000000004
as to just digitally render it and make

4068.559 --> 4074.4
it convincing

4071.359 --> 4078.4
right and now we're spoiled through

4074.4 --> 4081.119
science fiction movies and series with

4078.4 --> 4082.2400000000002
greatly enhanced cgi it looks so much

4081.119 --> 4084.6400000000003
more convincing now

4082.24 --> 4086.319
so much more as 20 years ago and and

4084.64 --> 4089.359
before that

4086.319 --> 4092.64
but still they consistently

4089.359 --> 4096.0
leave out certain visuals like you

4092.64 --> 4099.199
never see what it's like

4096.0 --> 4101.279
for a supposed spaceship to launch

4099.199 --> 4102.3189999999995
from the earth from the ship's

4101.279 --> 4105.4400000000005
perspective

4102.319 --> 4108.64
and then leave the earth they always

4105.44 --> 4110.879999999999
split it up compartmentalize it

4108.64 --> 4112.08
there's like oh you leave the rock

4110.88 --> 4115.92
perhaps

4112.08 --> 4119.679
then maybe a side view and then you see

4115.92 --> 4120.719
it coming into space with the ball

4119.679 --> 4123.52
behind it

4120.719 --> 4124.319
right they always compartmentalize these

4123.52 --> 4126.88
space

4124.319 --> 4127.679
sci-fi visuals because if they'd

4126.88 --> 4130.2390000000005
actually

4127.679 --> 4132.4
show a non-stop shot of what it would

4130.239 --> 4135.12
look like

4132.4 --> 4135.44
everybody would be immediately like that

4135.12 --> 4139.2789999999995
is

4135.44 --> 4140.799
not natural they'd all be like what the

4139.279 --> 4144.159000000001
hell is that

4140.799 --> 4147.44
that's bizarre and that's why they avoid

4144.159 --> 4149.44
that they learned that in the trickery

4147.44 --> 4150.799
over the ages and how to fool people

4149.44 --> 4154.719
like you need to leave that

4150.799 --> 4157.199
out or they'll catch on it's fake right

4154.719 --> 4159.359
so even in the cgi with all its

4157.199 --> 4162.5599999999995
convincing power

4159.359 --> 4163.92
they always leave out certain visuals

4162.56 --> 4167.120000000001
because if they would

4163.92 --> 4167.52
show you you would get a feeling like

4167.12 --> 4170.0
this

4167.52 --> 4170.56
is wrong there's something really wrong

4170.0 --> 4173.52
with

4170.56 --> 4176.159000000001
here like you're suddenly getting a dose

4173.52 --> 4178.0
of like hallucinogenic

4176.159 --> 4180.159
something that was what it would feel

4178.0 --> 4181.52
like if they'd if they would leave all

4180.159 --> 4183.2789999999995
that stuff in there

4181.52 --> 4184.719
that's why they get it out so you can

4183.279 --> 4187.6
still just like oh yeah

4184.719 --> 4189.279
space in the ball ooh it's awesome and

4187.6 --> 4190.400000000001
you're okay with switching scenes

4189.279 --> 4193.52
because hey

4190.4 --> 4195.679
it's a video it's on television it's a

4193.52 --> 4196.8
movie of course it switches scenes right

4195.679 --> 4200.84
it's all natural

4196.8 --> 4203.84
so that's perfect for that medium it's

4200.84 --> 4203.84
okay

4228.32 --> 4231.84
okay you can [ __ ] off now

4263.52 --> 4269.040000000001
save me from losing my wrench not

4266.719 --> 4269.84
that guy was blabbering on about cults

4269.04 --> 4272.32
and [ __ ]

4269.84 --> 4273.6
like if you would have timed him out i

4272.32 --> 4276.719
would have definitely

4273.6 --> 4279.76
condoned that but i just thought like

4276.719 --> 4282.159
i'm just gonna pan him

4279.76 --> 4284.08
right by the way if you really feel like

4282.159 --> 4284.96
this guy is going too far you can always

4284.08 --> 4287.6
just address

4284.96 --> 4289.04
me like hey i think this guy might be

4287.6 --> 4291.04
going too far

4289.04 --> 4293.5199999999995
that could also help right because hey

4291.04 --> 4295.6
i'm in the middle of an explanation

4293.52 --> 4296.56
when i'm really in the flow i don't have

4295.6 --> 4298.56
a

4296.56 --> 4300.400000000001
like i don't connect really to the chat

4298.56 --> 4303.120000000001
is such a moment

4300.4 --> 4315.839999999999
only when i stop then i can take a look

4303.12 --> 4315.84
at chat again

4317.36 --> 4321.199
right george sanford well the thing is

4319.28 --> 4322.08
about the globe earth it has a very

4321.199 --> 4325.919999999999
specific

4322.08 --> 4329.76
geometric size and geometry

4325.92 --> 4334.4
has all these kinds of consequences

4329.76 --> 4337.280000000001
like when you look at a geometry

4334.4 --> 4337.28
it has an edge

4338.719 --> 4342.08
right and it's always funny like even an

4341.6 --> 4344.0
infinite

4342.08 --> 4345.12
plane technically has an edge when you

4344.0 --> 4348.56
look at it

4345.12 --> 4351.44
it's just that practical visual

4348.56 --> 4352.64
sightings will not allow you to see

4351.44 --> 4355.199
infinitely

4352.64 --> 4356.08
right but in geometry excluding typical

4355.199 --> 4360.879999999999
optics effect

4356.08 --> 4364.8
yeah sure but a sphere has an edge

4360.88 --> 4367.36
when you look at where

4364.8 --> 4368.0
the sphere is and where it isn't right

4367.36 --> 4370.88
next to it

4368.0 --> 4372.0
right everything behind the sphere is

4370.88 --> 4374.08
concealed

4372.0 --> 4376.56
so this spherical geometry has very

4374.08 --> 4379.5199999999995
specific

4376.56 --> 4380.159000000001
consequences that on the small scale if

4379.52 --> 4383.76
you have an

4380.159 --> 4384.159
actual sphere and you use rulers and all

4383.76 --> 4387.1990000000005
that

4384.159 --> 4391.04
to try to see like okay

4387.199 --> 4392.96
how much is actually visually concealed

4391.04 --> 4396.08
when i look at it

4392.96 --> 4399.84
after a certain amount of angle right

4396.08 --> 4401.84
so yeah it's provable that spheres

4399.84 --> 4405.04
have an edge and they conceal things

4401.84 --> 4407.84
behind it well on the earth

4405.04 --> 4409.28
it doesn't really work like that at all

4407.84 --> 4412.0
why

4409.28 --> 4414.32
well because if you have extremely low

4412.0 --> 4417.36
observation height

4414.32 --> 4418.799999999999
and you see like a lot of kilometers

4417.36 --> 4422.239
into the distance you see

4418.8 --> 4424.400000000001
things very blatantly visually there

4422.239 --> 4426.718999999999
well that shouldn't be possible on that

4424.4 --> 4428.719
spherical geometry

4426.719 --> 4430.08
you shouldn't see any of it should all

4428.719 --> 4434.96
be gone behind

4430.08 --> 4434.96
the geometric edge behind the curve

4435.84 --> 4442.719
but we do see it at any point

4439.04 --> 4445.92
right sometimes we might not see it but

4442.719 --> 4448.64
if you ever see it

4445.92 --> 4450.8
that means it's not being concealed

4448.64 --> 4452.88
through geometry because if it was

4450.8 --> 4454.08
actually at certain points concealed by

4452.88 --> 4456.8
geometry

4454.08 --> 4457.679
then you would never be able to see it

4456.8 --> 4460.719
under any

4457.679 --> 4464.0
weather-like circumstance because things

4460.719 --> 4466.159
that are literally behind a geometry

4464.0 --> 4469.6
like behind the hill

4466.159 --> 4473.12
can never be made visible

4469.6 --> 4477.280000000001
due to miraging and this

4473.12 --> 4477.28
whether distorting visual effects

4477.84 --> 4481.12
things behind something else can never

4480.64 --> 4484.2390000000005
be

4481.12 --> 4487.92
made visible through

4484.239 --> 4490.879999999999
visual distortion effects like mirages

4487.92 --> 4492.4800000000005
can only displace things in relation to

4490.88 --> 4494.4800000000005
the horizon so something that what

4492.48 --> 4498.159
visible above the horizon

4494.48 --> 4499.04
might be moved moved upwards or move

4498.159 --> 4502.159
downwards

4499.04 --> 4505.44
so that you don't see all of it

4502.159 --> 4506.799999999999
or compacted or stretched up but if

4505.44 --> 4511.759999999999
something is

4506.8 --> 4515.1990000000005
geometrically behind something else

4511.76 --> 4517.84
if so an object is physically in between

4515.199 --> 4518.239
the observer and a thing behind it then

4517.84 --> 4520.96
no

4518.239 --> 4522.0
amount of visual distortion effects

4520.96 --> 4524.88
could ever

4522.0 --> 4525.76
make it visible that's physically

4524.88 --> 4529.84
impossible

4525.76 --> 4533.4400000000005
hands forth if you can see

4529.84 --> 4534.719
things clearly at an extremely low

4533.44 --> 4538.08
observation height at

4534.719 --> 4541.76
very fast distances that means

4538.08 --> 4545.28
it's not concealed behind a geometric

4541.76 --> 4548.2390000000005
thing and that means the earth

4545.28 --> 4550.08
is not a sphere of that geometry it can

4548.239 --> 4553.12
never be

4550.08 --> 4558.08
because of the before explained reasons

4553.12 --> 4558.08
so the earth is flat

4558.32 --> 4561.5199999999995
it's not the spherical geometry that is

4560.719 --> 4564.88
claimed by the

4561.52 --> 4568.400000000001
heliocentric model it is

4564.88 --> 4571.28
flat or if not perfectly flat but

4568.4 --> 4573.5199999999995
too hard to measure what it really is

4571.28 --> 4578.239
it's flat enough

4573.52 --> 4581.360000000001
it's so flat that we cannot find any

4578.239 --> 4582.32
kind of like angular deviation of any

4581.36 --> 4585.199
sort

4582.32 --> 4586.0
with our measuring equipment so it's

4585.199 --> 4588.879999999999
flat

4586.0 --> 4591.76
enough with certainty probably

4588.88 --> 4594.96
completely perfectly flat

4591.76 --> 4598.320000000001
but yeah that's too hard to determine

4594.96 --> 4598.32
with absolute certainty

4599.199 --> 4609.839999999999
right just being correct

4611.12 --> 4615.36
dude get the hell out of here scum

4618.84 --> 4623.6
[Music]

4620.159 --> 4625.28
stop squirting go back to your jam panda

4623.6 --> 4628.56
forums

4625.28 --> 4629.28
for your gamma squirt okay this place is

4628.56 --> 4637.84
not for you

4629.28 --> 4637.84
get out

4648.84 --> 4651.84
right

4666.08 --> 4669.28
all right by the way seeking starwood i

4667.679 --> 4671.92
do kind of agree

4669.28 --> 4672.32
the troll you shouldn't tell them like

4671.92 --> 4674.96
who

4672.32 --> 4677.04
you're suicidal or anything don't don't

4674.96 --> 4679.84
do that

4677.04 --> 4679.84
because it's unwise

4682.0 --> 4685.44
right i know i've said told people in

4684.56 --> 4688.4800000000005
rage win

4685.44 --> 4691.36
periods like you kill yourself yeah

4688.48 --> 4692.0
i regret saying that i understand why i

4691.36 --> 4695.92
said it i

4692.0 --> 4699.679
felt like a lot of i felt like

4695.92 --> 4701.92
well rage win

4699.679 --> 4702.88
but when i'm calm i just don't say that

4701.92 --> 4706.719
and

4702.88 --> 4710.88
and nobody should

4706.719 --> 4710.88
like even if it is in a question form

4711.679 --> 4715.76
right because if they're really these

4713.84 --> 4719.360000000001
nasty gammas all they

4715.76 --> 4723.1990000000005
will ever do is just pick

4719.36 --> 4726.88
the one mistake the one slight flaw

4723.199 --> 4729.12
and then use that to continue hammering

4726.88 --> 4730.719
it's what they always do that's why you

4729.12 --> 4735.84
should just

4730.719 --> 4735.84
prevent handing them anything

4746.84 --> 4752.8
anyway

4749.199 --> 4754.719
five years ago flat earth whoa

4752.8 --> 4756.08
flat earth was claiming wow i didn't

4754.719 --> 4763.84
know flat earth was a

4756.08 --> 4763.84
sentient conscience being huh

4774.84 --> 4777.84
so

4784.159 --> 4791.839999999999
that's right here at sanford

4802.84 --> 4805.84
ugh

4806.159 --> 4809.28
yeah i'm not giving you the satisfaction

4808.32 --> 4819.84
of

4809.28 --> 4819.84
being detected

4858.84 --> 4863.52
so

4861.28 --> 4864.88
all right yeah science works in

4863.52 --> 4867.76
mysterious ways but

4864.88 --> 4868.719
you know the thing is that's typically

4867.76 --> 4872.96
what they do

4868.719 --> 4875.44
every time you actually do lay it out

4872.96 --> 4876.56
really detailed concisely perfectly

4875.44 --> 4879.759999999999
clear

4876.56 --> 4880.400000000001
that is when the trolls suddenly like

4879.76 --> 4884.0
have to

4880.4 --> 4886.239
burst forth their straw man [ __ ]

4884.0 --> 4887.04
not because they want to inform you

4886.239 --> 4889.04
about it but

4887.04 --> 4891.5199999999995
because they need to do something in

4889.04 --> 4894.48
order to stop

4891.52 --> 4896.0
prevent themselves getting the hint you

4894.48 --> 4898.4
see

4896.0 --> 4899.28
so they just literally spam forth their

4898.4 --> 4901.92
[ __ ]

4899.28 --> 4903.44
in an attempt to prevent themselves from

4901.92 --> 4906.719
catching on that they believe in

4903.44 --> 4909.919999999999
complete and utter horror [ __ ]

4906.719 --> 4912.96
and that their arguments have been

4909.92 --> 4913.4400000000005
rebutted their strategy is just if you

4912.96 --> 4916.4800000000005
have

4913.44 --> 4919.919999999999
enough fallacious [ __ ] claims you

4916.48 --> 4925.04
can make about the opposition

4919.92 --> 4928.719
then you can just roulette scattergun it

4925.04 --> 4931.92
to never stop talking so that you will

4928.719 --> 4932.8
never have to confront yourself with the

4931.92 --> 4937.04
rebuttal

4932.8 --> 4940.400000000001
for every single stupid claim you make

4937.04 --> 4942.48
let's start standard tactic now right

4940.4 --> 4944.239
because the shooting of the straw man

4942.48 --> 4947.718999999999
questions isn't

4944.239 --> 4951.36
to test you it's to prevent

4947.719 --> 4954.88
themselves from realizing

4951.36 --> 4957.839999999999
they're absolutely wrong

4954.88 --> 4959.4400000000005
that's why they do that to drown out the

4957.84 --> 4961.84
noise that's why it's called scatter

4959.44 --> 4961.839999999999
gunning

4968.159 --> 4971.199
i know i know that describes a lot of

4970.88 --> 4975.1990000000005
this

4971.199 --> 4978.719
it's standard tactic it's like

4975.199 --> 4978.719
that's what they all end up doing

4984.639 --> 4988.0
and that's the way you know you're

4985.76 --> 4990.639
dealing with an anti-flat earther

4988.0 --> 4992.88
because it's somebody that's on purpose

4990.639 --> 4995.84
trying to avoid

4992.88 --> 4995.84
figuring it out

4996.8 --> 5002.88
those who choose to continue on

5000.0 --> 5002.88
with error

5005.28 --> 5012.08
and on purpose avoiding

5008.32 --> 5013.199
figuring out the the proof to themselves

5012.08 --> 5017.679
it is an error

5013.199 --> 5020.638999999999
right so they fight their way through

5017.679 --> 5020.639
with fallacies

5022.8 --> 5029.84
it's like fallacy hedging

5026.08 --> 5029.84
it really is

5041.12 --> 5046.88
gas pressure can't exist next to no

5043.679 --> 5046.88
global claims is

5047.28 --> 5053.5199999999995
no no no global has to claim

5051.52 --> 5054.639
gas pressure can't exist next to a

5053.52 --> 5058.0
vacuum

5054.639 --> 5058.719
that's natural law it's not a globe or

5058.0 --> 5062.239
claim

5058.719 --> 5064.56
it's natural law

5062.239 --> 5065.919999999999
yeah and a gas pressure gradient only

5064.56 --> 5068.96
exists

5065.92 --> 5072.0
for a singular reason that is because

5068.96 --> 5073.92
it can form secondary

5072.0 --> 5075.76
to the gas pressure expanding in all

5073.92 --> 5079.4400000000005
directions in order to fill

5075.76 --> 5083.4400000000005
the volume of the container and having

5079.44 --> 5086.719
the walls of the container effectively

5083.44 --> 5088.799999999999
cause all the gas pressure right and

5086.719 --> 5094.08
then the gradient can set in

5088.8 --> 5094.08
as a secondary effect that's right

5095.52 --> 5100.400000000001
you require gas pressure gradient

5098.4 --> 5104.719
requires a container

5100.4 --> 5113.839999999999
you didn't know or did you forget

5104.719 --> 5113.84
yeah i know you did

5137.199 --> 5142.159
they know who the unvaccinated people

5139.199 --> 5145.04
are truly a scary thought

5142.159 --> 5148.08
scary to them guns have never owned

5145.04 --> 5148.08
scary to them

5153.36 --> 5159.839999999999
don't let their

5156.8 --> 5162.96
fear project onto you

5159.84 --> 5165.6
unvaccinated people should not be scared

5162.96 --> 5166.4800000000005
it's the vaccinated people that should

5165.6 --> 5169.76
be scared they

5166.48 --> 5174.5599999999995
are literally being penned in like

5169.76 --> 5176.639
cattle by a death cult system

5174.56 --> 5178.719
yeah and oh they know who the

5176.639 --> 5182.96
unvaccinated people yeah yeah

5178.719 --> 5183.6
that's fine why not they will be afraid

5182.96 --> 5186.0
of it

5183.6 --> 5187.280000000001
they will be afraid of but these people

5186.0 --> 5190.48
aren't contained

5187.28 --> 5192.5599999999995
they are not put in the pen we can't

5190.48 --> 5195.678999999999
predict what they'll do they will not

5192.56 --> 5197.76
listen to what they're told to do and

5195.679 --> 5202.56
that makes them afraid

5197.76 --> 5202.56
yeah we know they should fear us

5204.159 --> 5210.638999999999
as long as they leave us alone

5208.239 --> 5211.759999999999
have nothing to fear they can sit in

5210.639 --> 5214.400000000001
their

5211.76 --> 5216.320000000001
death cult pen all day long and they

5214.4 --> 5218.239
partain in their experiments until

5216.32 --> 5220.88
they're all dead

5218.239 --> 5220.879999999999
go ahead

5222.08 --> 5229.92
but yeah if you come after us we're free

5226.56 --> 5232.96
we are not blinded by indoctrination

5229.92 --> 5233.6
concerning this medical propaganda we

5232.96 --> 5236.08
know how

5233.6 --> 5237.280000000001
things work we know why they work the

5236.08 --> 5239.84
way they do

5237.28 --> 5241.92
you can't do anything to us really and

5239.84 --> 5244.2390000000005
we know that now

5241.92 --> 5246.159
we know it's all a corporate scam it's

5244.239 --> 5247.5199999999995
all voluntary based you can't do

5246.159 --> 5253.839999999999
anything about it

5247.52 --> 5253.84
you can only take away the lollipops

5255.28 --> 5267.84
so they fear us we should not

5259.12 --> 5267.84
fear them don't squirt

5269.28 --> 5273.199
all right but i think you technically

5272.08 --> 5275.5199999999995
agree with that

5273.199 --> 5276.4
i hope so guns have never owned our mp i

5275.52 --> 5278.56
really do you

5276.4 --> 5281.839999999999
shouldn't be afraid they should be

5278.56 --> 5281.84
afraid of you

5288.21 --> 5291.46
[Music]

5297.44 --> 5301.28
yeah well guns have never owned i'm

5299.44 --> 5303.44
gonna go with that metaphor right so

5301.28 --> 5305.5199999999995
they will gradually squeeze it well you

5303.44 --> 5309.12
know what happens

5305.52 --> 5313.6
when you squeeze

5309.12 --> 5315.199
bulls and cows that live in the wild

5313.6 --> 5316.88
you know what happens when you squeeze

5315.199 --> 5320.159
them

5316.88 --> 5323.36
they go into a stampede and then they

5320.159 --> 5326.879999999999
roll right over fences and

5323.36 --> 5329.92
go right through barns and they'll wreck

5326.88 --> 5331.76
everything yeah that's what happens when

5329.92 --> 5335.04
you squeeze

5331.76 --> 5336.320000000001
on wild cattle they don't like to be

5335.04 --> 5337.679
squeezed you know

5336.32 --> 5339.679
when you're all penned in and

5337.679 --> 5341.28
indoctrinated yeah you'll accept

5339.679 --> 5343.92
anything where are you gonna go you're

5341.28 --> 5345.04
penned in right if you do that on wild

5343.92 --> 5347.6
cattle

5345.04 --> 5348.8
there will be a backlash you will have a

5347.6 --> 5352.0
problem

5348.8 --> 5355.76
you can't really squeeze it

5352.0 --> 5357.04
right we're awaken we know how this

5355.76 --> 5360.159000000001
works

5357.04 --> 5360.8
we know what they can get away with and

5360.159 --> 5364.239
what

5360.8 --> 5368.08
they can't where their legal backing

5364.239 --> 5368.08
ends we know

5376.159 --> 5381.28
so don't be afraid fear not

5381.6 --> 5393.84
lesson number one fear not

5386.08 --> 5393.84
there's never a good reason to

5404.84 --> 5407.84
hey

5409.52 --> 5414.2390000000005
right i think i'm gonna round out the

5411.12 --> 5414.69
show i'd say overall it was a very good

5414.239 --> 5416.718999999999
show
