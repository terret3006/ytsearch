so yeah weather is quite different from

125.28 --> 130.64000000000001
yesterday it's

128.64 --> 132.95899999999997
it's not sunny at all

130.64 --> 134.07999999999998
it's cloudy

132.959 --> 135.92000000000002
it's been

134.08 --> 138.31900000000002
raining

135.92 --> 140.23899999999998
a lot in the night

138.319 --> 143.23899999999998
and especially just like kind of

140.239 --> 143.239
storming

147.44 --> 150.72
it's kind of cold

149.92 --> 152.16
but

150.72 --> 155.48
yeah

152.16 --> 155.48
i don't know

156.08 --> 161.28
a place up there that seems a little bit

158.8 --> 163.68
less clouded you can almost see the blue

161.28 --> 165.92
through there so i don't know maybe it

163.68 --> 168.31900000000002
will clear up at some point the clouds

165.92 --> 171.83999999999997
don't seem to be rushing by as quickly

168.319 --> 171.83999999999997
up there as they did yesterday

173.04 --> 175.2
so

182.08 --> 186.48000000000002
i think there's just a lot of moist in

184.08 --> 186.48000000000002
the air

187.2 --> 191.67999999999998
anyway

188.959 --> 194.56
hello pj crew shank first in chat good

191.68 --> 194.56
to see you again

196.64 --> 204.599
it is

199.36 --> 204.59900000000002
tuesday the 2nd of november 2021

210.959 --> 214.159
hello stone monkey

215.68 --> 219.76000000000002
and uh yeah

217.68 --> 222.4
yesterday show has given me a lot to

219.76 --> 222.39999999999998
think about

222.799 --> 228.799
like a lot

226.08 --> 231.84
and i'm actually kind of in an internal

228.799 --> 231.84
conflict right now

232.08 --> 239.799
because i i couldn't find any

235.519 --> 239.799
kind of base to touch upon

240.48 --> 242.879
clutch

244.319 --> 249.11999999999998
right so yesterday like i really ruffled

247.84 --> 251.519
some feathers

249.12 --> 254.0
i really did

251.519 --> 255.59900000000002
and

254.0 --> 257.12
i might have been a little bit too

255.599 --> 258.239
presumptuous

257.12 --> 259.759
or rather

258.239 --> 261.67999999999995
too quick to

259.759 --> 262.639
what it is presumptuous

261.68 --> 265.68
to

262.639 --> 270.96000000000004
quick to draw conclusions

265.68 --> 275.44
it's just that this whole christianity

270.96 --> 279.19899999999996
and like the true nature of god

275.44 --> 282.0
in relation to man specifically

279.199 --> 283.759
it's really like weighing on me a lot

282.0 --> 285.6
right now

283.759 --> 287.91900000000004
it's not so much that i'm like in

285.6 --> 290.08000000000004
anguish

287.919 --> 290.08
but

291.199 --> 296.24
yeah i've been getting a lot of flack

294.08 --> 298.479
in comments some were just straight out

296.24 --> 299.28000000000003
gamma others

298.479 --> 301.59999999999997
well

299.28 --> 303.59999999999997
i basically deleted the gamma comments

301.6 --> 306.16
because it's like that's just so

303.6 --> 308.16
ludicrous it's probably not even real

306.16 --> 311.40000000000003
christians or anything

308.16 --> 311.40000000000003
just trolls

311.68 --> 313.919
but

315.039 --> 319.12
somebody yes they did leave it

317.759 --> 323.88
sorry about that

319.12 --> 323.88
somebody yesterday did actually leave a

324.4 --> 328.56
a comment

326.72 --> 331.28000000000003
that really did make me

328.56 --> 334.08
think in a way because it wasn't just

331.28 --> 336.4
straight out filled with chance

334.08 --> 339.039
and it is all about the whole

336.4 --> 340.96
prophecy thing

339.039 --> 344.0
i don't really know what to do with that

340.96 --> 346.479
i have sort of a conspiracy theory

344.0 --> 347.759
trainer thought about it

346.479 --> 350.0
it's just

347.759 --> 353.0
nowhere i can go with it

350.0 --> 353.0
nowhere

367.36 --> 370.24
it's difficult

379.039 --> 383.44
all right so i could try to roll it out

382.4 --> 385.75899999999996
again

383.44 --> 388.96
unless everybody's gonna be all like

385.759 --> 388.96000000000004
could you please stop this

391.6 --> 395.84000000000003
because maybe i should just give it a

393.36 --> 395.84000000000003
rest

397.759 --> 400.24
i don't know

406.639 --> 410.24
daniel robles cleary

410.639 --> 413.599
you're interested

417.68 --> 422.40000000000003
i'm interested but your show oh okay of

420.479 --> 426.039
course it's my show

422.4 --> 426.039
but i'm asking

438.0 --> 442.08
i mean there's

439.599 --> 444.88
the whole setup with the prophecy is so

442.08 --> 444.88
complicated

445.759 --> 448.16
right

447.36 --> 451.44
and

448.16 --> 454.319
i bet it's been echoing on in like

451.44 --> 458.08
different religions for a long time i

454.319 --> 460.40000000000003
think this is like an old conflict

458.08 --> 462.24
that's like almost unresolvable it's

460.4 --> 464.4
like a puzzle and there's different ways

462.24 --> 467.68
to approach it and they completely

464.4 --> 467.67999999999995
contrast in result

471.68 --> 474.479
like is

475.199 --> 478.199
like

481.68 --> 484.68
ugh

497.52 --> 501.919
like is jesus christ really

502.24 --> 506.479
the exact prophet

504.4 --> 507.919
as was

506.479 --> 511.199
like

507.919 --> 513.8389999999999
prophesized in the old testament

511.199 --> 515.519
or did he actually

513.839 --> 516.399
kind of

515.519 --> 519.2
well

516.399 --> 520.56
for good reason i'd say

519.2 --> 524.88
hijack

520.56 --> 526.3199999999999
the principle and try to replace

524.88 --> 529.8389999999999
the old

526.32 --> 533.12
god conception with a new one

529.839 --> 535.839
right your father not my father

533.12 --> 535.839
is kind of a hint

539.12 --> 546.9590000000001
but that he would kind of play into it

542.88 --> 550.0
like he almost kind of social engineered

546.959 --> 551.279
the entire old religion

550.0 --> 554.08
like that

551.279 --> 557.68
now this is just grossly oversimplified

554.08 --> 560.88
and you can already hear in like the

557.68 --> 562.16
scripture readers heads and all their

560.88 --> 566.08
everything that they have like

562.16 --> 569.04
researched like endless

566.08 --> 571.279
sentences and responses on like

569.04 --> 573.1999999999999
ugh

571.279 --> 576.2
i almost feel like i just can't handle

573.2 --> 576.2
this

581.6 --> 585.279
what i struggle with is that

587.2 --> 592.88
in a way i really see jesus christ

591.12 --> 595.12
even though he might not

592.88 --> 598.959
literally be that figure in the bible

595.12 --> 602.9590000000001
but maybe that may be a a play written

598.959 --> 605.8389999999999
about somebody that he originally was

602.959 --> 605.8389999999999
that he was like

609.12 --> 614.5600000000001
don't take this the wrong way this is

610.959 --> 617.76
esoterics not literal that he was like

614.56 --> 620.079
a satanist of his time somebody that

617.76 --> 621.279
actually opposed

620.079 --> 624.2399999999999
everything

621.279 --> 624.24
the whole thing

626.399 --> 630.0
that

628.079 --> 632.16
i don't know

630.0 --> 634.64
i don't understand where it even came

632.16 --> 636.16
from if it was like because it was all

634.64 --> 637.8389999999999
good

636.16 --> 640.079
it was all good

637.839 --> 640.0790000000001
like

640.8 --> 646.24
was it just a natural effect that he

643.68 --> 648.8
came about in the in like the peak of

646.24 --> 648.8
darkness

649.2 --> 655.12
as a contrast like things could probably

652.72 --> 657.36
not have degraded further

655.12 --> 659.04
and then he just came

657.36 --> 661.519
like a satanist

659.04 --> 663.5999999999999
but because of

661.519 --> 665.68
yeah not that's not like the modern day

663.6 --> 668.399
idea right

665.68 --> 669.76
it's like the opposer right because that

668.399 --> 674.279
is kind of

669.76 --> 674.279
the root effect of the word

676.88 --> 681.279
well if they weren't mad they're going

678.399 --> 683.68
to be now yeah but this is not like that

681.279 --> 685.68
i'm not i'm trying to

683.68 --> 688.3199999999999
an opposer maybe it's just better to not

685.68 --> 690.64
just call it a satanist but an opposer

688.32 --> 693.0400000000001
the problem is that satanism is kind of

690.64 --> 693.04
born

693.2 --> 696.5600000000001
within that

694.64 --> 699.76
idea within the rebellion and then it

696.56 --> 703.279
gets bad and aggravated and inhumane and

699.76 --> 705.68
you know how that goes right that's not

703.279 --> 709.519
why i'm not putting that on jesus okay

705.68 --> 712.079
absolutely not he's the good guy

709.519 --> 716.399
and nobody

712.079 --> 717.4399999999999
is gonna take that away from me

716.399 --> 720.32
it's just

717.44 --> 723.0400000000001
yeah i'm sorry pj i am stressing myself

720.32 --> 726.0790000000001
i because i care

723.04 --> 726.079
okay i care

726.32 --> 730.0400000000001
and it kind of hurts

732.079 --> 737.4399999999999
it just it makes me feel like the world

734.639 --> 739.519
is in so much more darkness that i could

737.44 --> 740.5600000000001
have ever imagined

739.519 --> 743.639
just because of all the

740.56 --> 745.1999999999999
misunderstandings and the systematic

743.639 --> 748.0790000000001
misunderstandings that have been

745.2 --> 751.12
integrated in like the things we take to

748.079 --> 751.12
heart the closest

755.36 --> 760.88
it's so personal to people they are so

758.639 --> 762.8
hurt and it's not just like gamma

760.88 --> 764.88
outrage hurt even

762.8 --> 768.5999999999999
i mean the format is gamma but it is

764.88 --> 768.6
genuine hurt

782.399 --> 787.639
all right

784.639 --> 787.639
anyway

789.68 --> 795.1999999999999
no i'm not giving excite no the anxiety

792.24 --> 798.88
is kind of already over me

795.2 --> 798.88
i'm just trying to deal with it now

799.68 --> 802.079
like

800.88 --> 803.6
i'm

802.079 --> 805.76
puzzled

803.6 --> 806.72
like seriously did i

805.76 --> 809.279
make

806.72 --> 812.839
actual mistakes yesterday

809.279 --> 816.48
or did i do the exact right thing

812.839 --> 819.7600000000001
i i don't know

816.48 --> 819.76
and i'm frustrated

826.959 --> 831.8389999999999
i do you don't want to see me well pj i

829.199 --> 833.199
appreciate that i really appreciate the

831.839 --> 835.2790000000001
sympathy

833.199 --> 837.199
but i'm just trying to do what i think

835.279 --> 841.639
it needs to be done i need to try to

837.199 --> 841.639
clarify what this all is

855.44 --> 858.8800000000001
right

856.72 --> 861.36
because for whatever train of thought i

858.88 --> 865.04
put down whatever i claim

861.36 --> 866.48
for example about jesus

865.04 --> 867.5999999999999
never

866.48 --> 869.6800000000001
mistake

867.6 --> 870.88
that i think he is

869.68 --> 873.519
he was

870.88 --> 876.72
the good guy

873.519 --> 877.76
better than anybody

876.72 --> 879.279
like i

877.76 --> 882.8
i truly

879.279 --> 882.8
deeply believe that

883.76 --> 888.72
and i think that that in itself has been

886.959 --> 891.68
subjected

888.72 --> 894.1600000000001
to like endless machinations and

891.68 --> 894.88
psychological torture

894.16 --> 898.24
to

894.88 --> 901.279
because they couldn't deal with it the

898.24 --> 902.5600000000001
control couldn't deal with it

901.279 --> 905.24
so they just

902.56 --> 907.76
they kind of tried to create some weird

905.24 --> 909.36
self-destruction religion almost out of

907.76 --> 911.519
it

909.36 --> 914.5600000000001
to be able to control whoever would

911.519 --> 915.92
actually try to follow in jesus

914.56 --> 919.1199999999999
footsteps

915.92 --> 921.279
so they could control and then corrupt

919.12 --> 924.72
them or

921.279 --> 927.12
because of the design of everything

924.72 --> 931.12
it would eventually lead to their

927.12 --> 931.12
destruction their physical destruction

938.399 --> 941.839
hey matthew hall

951.199 --> 955.199
if you don't agree with it

953.68 --> 957.04
don't play

955.199 --> 960.04
don't pay

957.04 --> 960.04
what

968.56 --> 972.4799999999999
i i thank you bg cruz shank

975.44 --> 978.72
but it's not haters

977.36 --> 981.44
you see

978.72 --> 983.6
it's hurters

981.44 --> 985.36
the gammas like the trolls that don't

983.6 --> 987.36
really care they're just trying to see

985.36 --> 989.279
like oh is there a weakness can we break

987.36 --> 991.36
him with this can we make him lose all

989.279 --> 993.759
faith and energy right

991.36 --> 995.44
those are no problem

993.759 --> 997.44
because they respond like that to

995.44 --> 998.5600000000001
everything it's very consistent in his

997.44 --> 1000.0
energy

998.56 --> 1002.3199999999999
no i'm

1000.0 --> 1005.68
concerned about

1002.32 --> 1005.6800000000001
good people that are hurt

1007.36 --> 1011.839
so it's not the haters it's the hurters

1014.0 --> 1016.639
or the hurt

1016.8 --> 1022.4799999999999
because i don't want to hurt good people

1019.279 --> 1026.079
people that really are good

1022.48 --> 1030.0
i want to help them understand it better

1026.079 --> 1030.0
i want to help them awaken further

1031.039 --> 1035.959
i want to resolve this confusion

1065.919 --> 1070.16
oh hello cleary by the way and julio of

1067.76 --> 1070.16
heaven

1071.12 --> 1077.08
miss crazy ad

1073.6 --> 1077.08
george sanford

1091.679 --> 1098.5590000000002
all right matthew but let's see that's

1094.48 --> 1098.559
that's what i was hoping for the most

1099.28 --> 1103.76
but rather i was hoping to be

1104.64 --> 1109.3600000000001
digging in people

1106.96 --> 1111.1200000000001
like how did you

1109.36 --> 1113.52
contemplate this

1111.12 --> 1116.32
was there a solution other than just

1113.52 --> 1119.84
surrender to the mechanism

1116.32 --> 1122.6399999999999
you see because i can't really do that

1119.84 --> 1124.08
that would break everything

1122.64 --> 1126.7990000000002
that would break everything i've built

1124.08 --> 1126.799
for myself

1129.12 --> 1135.6
i truly believe in logic like that

1132.64 --> 1138.0800000000002
and if logic doesn't seem to be there

1135.6 --> 1141.48
then you must be missing something you

1138.08 --> 1141.48
must be

1153.28 --> 1156.559
oh all right house g

1158.32 --> 1161.4399999999998
yeah

1159.28 --> 1162.8799999999999
that's cool by the way i'm giving you a

1161.44 --> 1165.8400000000001
wrench

1162.88 --> 1169.2
so if you want you can literally

1165.84 --> 1173.3999999999999
post your youtube video music that of

1169.2 --> 1173.4
your channel when you like

1188.4 --> 1192.0
all right

1190.16 --> 1194.0800000000002
i don't think i'm like gonna play all of

1192.0 --> 1196.08
your songs like on here but i'll

1194.08 --> 1198.0
definitely give you the opportunity to

1196.08 --> 1200.3999999999999
link them up when you got a new song

1198.0 --> 1202.64
that's perfectly fine to do

1200.4 --> 1207.0
so you got a wrench

1202.64 --> 1207.0
now you deserve it you're a good guy

1210.559 --> 1214.9189999999999
mind the rules though don't forget

1258.559 --> 1260.8799999999999
all right

1261.2 --> 1267.679
by the way i really need to somehow

1263.919 --> 1269.8400000000001
get my monitor fixed soon

1267.679 --> 1272.4
somehow because like this morning it

1269.84 --> 1274.32
took me like 15 minutes just to turn it

1272.4 --> 1277.8400000000001
on

1274.32 --> 1279.6
like it's not getting any better

1277.84 --> 1283.12
i i don't know if my monitor is going to

1279.6 --> 1283.12
make it to the end of the year

1285.52 --> 1289.96
i've been using it for so long

1290.0 --> 1292.88
15 years

1293.6 --> 1297.52
it's

1294.4 --> 1298.799
best monitor i've ever had

1297.52 --> 1300.48
but

1298.799 --> 1303.84
it seems like the

1300.48 --> 1306.159
the power supply like the built-in power

1303.84 --> 1308.24
thing is kind of like

1306.159 --> 1312.2
dying

1308.24 --> 1312.2
let's add its last legs

1344.84 --> 1348.3999999999999
oh all right

1348.72 --> 1355.6000000000001
yeah clutch i appreciate that

1351.919 --> 1359.3200000000002
i do genuinely love god and goodness

1355.6 --> 1359.32
it's just that

1368.48 --> 1372.159
is

1369.84 --> 1373.1999999999998
this god and goodness just the power

1372.159 --> 1377.0390000000002
that was

1373.2 --> 1377.039
incorporated in humanity

1380.799 --> 1389.24
or is like

1384.159 --> 1389.24
is it just so mega elusive

1397.44 --> 1401.679
because like when i

1399.12 --> 1404.1589999999999
dig into christianity

1401.679 --> 1405.8400000000001
and the bible it just

1404.159 --> 1407.8400000000001
it's different

1405.84 --> 1410.559
it's different from

1407.84 --> 1410.559
what i feel

1411.12 --> 1415.4399999999998
and there's many things that i even

1413.36 --> 1418.24
originally doubted that i've come to

1415.44 --> 1421.2
like learn from practical advice

1418.24 --> 1423.52
from practical experience like okay

1421.2 --> 1426.88
that interpretation when i was younger

1423.52 --> 1426.8799999999999
is nonsense like

1427.039 --> 1431.12
like i thought that

1428.72 --> 1433.6000000000001
gay was okay when i was a kid because i

1431.12 --> 1435.52
didn't know any better

1433.6 --> 1436.6399999999999
i wasn't like that

1435.52 --> 1438.6399999999999
i just

1436.64 --> 1442.3600000000001
didn't understand what that was and the

1438.64 --> 1442.3600000000001
consequences etc

1449.679 --> 1453.919
right so that was one of the things that

1451.84 --> 1457.9599999999998
i don't deserve why why are they so

1453.919 --> 1457.96
against that what's the problem

1458.48 --> 1462.64
like now of course gay people will not

1461.039 --> 1465.039
go that crazy

1462.64 --> 1467.8400000000001
but i didn't know about it i didn't know

1465.039 --> 1470.48
that well they would

1467.84 --> 1470.48
a lot of them

1471.44 --> 1476.0
right now

1472.88 --> 1478.72
i know those basics i understand the

1476.0 --> 1478.72
basics but

1481.12 --> 1487.36
that's design right that's design you

1484.159 --> 1490.0800000000002
can find empirical proof of that design

1487.36 --> 1491.36
now the nature of god himself and like

1490.08 --> 1494.96
the idea

1491.36 --> 1494.9599999999998
of sacrificing the lamb

1496.159 --> 1500.64
what is that

1499.36 --> 1502.799
what

1500.64 --> 1505.7990000000002
is that

1502.799 --> 1505.799
why

1527.039 --> 1530.64
all right theo it's like

1536.96 --> 1541.96
right the the first thing i think of

1539.279 --> 1543.76
that kind of sort of in the direction of

1541.96 --> 1545.919
justifiing that

1543.76 --> 1549.039
is like okay that's

1545.919 --> 1550.48
about food it's about

1549.039 --> 1551.279
like eat

1550.48 --> 1554.72
meat

1551.279 --> 1556.72
periodically it's kind of it's better

1554.72 --> 1560.32
like it gives you this physical

1556.72 --> 1561.679
advantage that's good even though it is

1560.32 --> 1564.08
kind of gruesome because you have to

1561.679 --> 1565.1200000000001
kill an animal

1564.08 --> 1565.9189999999999
right

1565.12 --> 1568.08
but

1565.919 --> 1570.3200000000002
everybody can't

1568.08 --> 1571.4399999999998
like says no no that's not what it's

1570.32 --> 1572.559
about

1571.44 --> 1575.6000000000001
at all

1572.559 --> 1576.96
and then it just confuses the hell out

1575.6 --> 1580.76
of me

1576.96 --> 1580.76
it really does

1594.72 --> 1598.96
right clutch well look

1597.279 --> 1601.76
these christians

1598.96 --> 1601.76
they're acting

1603.919 --> 1606.88
like communists

1607.679 --> 1611.2
it's like oh you don't go with the

1609.919 --> 1612.96
narrative

1611.2 --> 1615.039
our narrative

1612.96 --> 1616.32
then we

1615.039 --> 1619.679
get out

1616.32 --> 1621.039
right you get the full blown

1619.679 --> 1623.1200000000001
[ __ ]

1621.039 --> 1625.52
right until it's like oh oh now i'm

1623.12 --> 1626.7199999999998
gonna release that darkness part towards

1625.52 --> 1629.679
you

1626.72 --> 1633.52
up until the point that i feel this

1629.679 --> 1635.919
justified not too far for god

1633.52 --> 1637.84
right but that happens every time that's

1635.919 --> 1639.3600000000001
the same mechanism that like the

1637.84 --> 1643.52
communists

1639.36 --> 1646.0
use for their insanity for their a moral

1643.52 --> 1647.679
culture

1646.0 --> 1649.36
you understand

1647.679 --> 1652.3200000000002
because i think that

1649.36 --> 1653.6789999999999
christianity the way with it came into

1652.32 --> 1657.2
being

1653.679 --> 1660.159
was the precursor

1657.2 --> 1660.159
to communism

1660.32 --> 1664.24
the similarities are

1662.799 --> 1666.6399999999999
astounding

1664.24 --> 1668.72
when you really get to the details

1666.64 --> 1670.5590000000002
now again

1668.72 --> 1671.44
christ right

1670.559 --> 1673.039
that

1671.44 --> 1675.279
has nothing to do with christ that

1673.039 --> 1679.039
happened after he died

1675.279 --> 1679.039
that's when it was all constructed

1681.6 --> 1687.8799999999999
and that makes everything really

1684.88 --> 1687.88
confusing

1714.64 --> 1720.72
because i just feel that

1716.88 --> 1722.7990000000002
in overall christianity as it came forth

1720.72 --> 1725.2
from jesus himself

1722.799 --> 1726.96
was then after his death

1725.2 --> 1728.0800000000002
mechanized

1726.96 --> 1731.039
it was

1728.08 --> 1732.1589999999999
kind of socially engineered in a certain

1731.039 --> 1735.76
way

1732.159 --> 1737.0390000000002
to be more effective and more

1735.76 --> 1739.84
easy

1737.039 --> 1743.76
for insiders for the priesthood to

1739.84 --> 1746.6399999999999
control others with chance

1743.76 --> 1748.799
that's what communism does

1746.64 --> 1750.8400000000001
it's the same thing now you could say oh

1748.799 --> 1754.72
that communism is the

1750.84 --> 1756.1589999999999
antichrist religion it's like yeah

1754.72 --> 1760.0
but

1756.159 --> 1763.3600000000001
it has the same structural changes right

1760.0 --> 1765.6
it's not the christianity is not

1763.36 --> 1768.24
rock christian it's not raw jesus

1765.6 --> 1773.48
teachings it isn't there's all this

1768.24 --> 1773.48
other stuff that's been grafted in

1781.919 --> 1785.76
he's whoa he said that

1784.08 --> 1789.1999999999998
not be done anymore because it was a

1785.76 --> 1791.52
tradition so it wasn't ordained by god

1789.2 --> 1794.3990000000001
so he didn't

1791.52 --> 1796.72
by his death undo the

1794.399 --> 1797.52
necessity to do it

1796.72 --> 1800.88
see

1797.52 --> 1802.72
thank you matthew hall thank you so much

1800.88 --> 1804.5590000000002
because i know i thought it was always

1802.72 --> 1807.039
illegitimate

1804.559 --> 1809.2
and i hadn't even read the detail of

1807.039 --> 1811.76
that

1809.2 --> 1814.48
just that was my impression and that's

1811.76 --> 1816.799
amazing

1814.48 --> 1819.2
that christ literally said it like that

1816.799 --> 1822.84
if you are correctly

1819.2 --> 1822.8400000000001
rephrasing it

1829.039 --> 1834.08
so then he didn't fulfill some freaking

1832.08 --> 1836.6399999999999
blood pact

1834.08 --> 1840.24
by his own words

1836.64 --> 1843.1200000000001
because he denounced its value

1840.24 --> 1847.84
that's not god

1843.12 --> 1850.8799999999999
through jesus changing what is a law and

1847.84 --> 1852.6399999999999
then oh it's sealed now god suddenly

1850.88 --> 1855.44
doesn't demand it anymore no jesus

1852.64 --> 1858.64
himself apparently said no

1855.44 --> 1860.3990000000001
that was never of god

1858.64 --> 1864.6000000000001
that's amazing

1860.399 --> 1864.6
i totally agree with that

1882.48 --> 1885.48
so

1897.279 --> 1901.76
right matthew and yeah and then my idea

1899.679 --> 1904.0
was

1901.76 --> 1904.0
that

1904.64 --> 1908.3990000000001
after jesus's death

1907.279 --> 1911.6
the

1908.399 --> 1913.5189999999998
well the those that made the bible

1911.6 --> 1917.4399999999998
they did their

1913.519 --> 1917.44
yeah what they all been doing like

1918.32 --> 1926.72
they basically made him i think

1921.84 --> 1929.6
into this claimed sacrifice to draw in

1926.72 --> 1931.76
what was physically present culturally

1929.6 --> 1933.6789999999999
with people out there

1931.76 --> 1937.679
you could call it pagan i don't even

1933.679 --> 1941.8400000000001
know if that's real like is that pagan

1937.679 --> 1942.96
or is it just this old old crazy habit

1941.84 --> 1946.1589999999999
of

1942.96 --> 1948.559
slaughter sacrifice

1946.159 --> 1951.2
because i don't think that pagan like

1948.559 --> 1953.12
neces has a necessity for that sort of

1951.2 --> 1955.519
sacrifice

1953.12 --> 1955.5189999999998
at all

1956.48 --> 1960.3990000000001
right so did

1958.32 --> 1964.0
the bible makers kind of

1960.399 --> 1967.9189999999999
turn jesus into a sacrifice

1964.0 --> 1969.76
to convince everybody out there

1967.919 --> 1972.5590000000002
to lay down

1969.76 --> 1977.72
the tradition of sacrifice

1972.559 --> 1977.72
was was it a political maneuver

1979.84 --> 1984.799
which is crazy by the way if you think

1982.32 --> 1987.2
about it that they would basically make

1984.799 --> 1989.44
a political maneuver in a religion like

1987.2 --> 1990.559
that

1989.44 --> 1992.88
but it

1990.559 --> 1995.44
i it

1992.88 --> 1998.24
sticks to mine

1995.44 --> 2002.679
now i i laid this before for adam meekin

1998.24 --> 2002.679
for example he disagrees with this

2006.88 --> 2012.5590000000002
it's

2009.2 --> 2014.32
it makes it all really complicated

2012.559 --> 2016.48
because that's a sign that like the

2014.32 --> 2019.76
entire foundation

2016.48 --> 2022.96
of the christian religion as we've come

2019.76 --> 2028.48
to know it even in the early days was

2022.96 --> 2028.48
utterly corrupted and that is kind of my

2029.039 --> 2034.08
that is the whole i've been seeing that

2031.6 --> 2036.1589999999999
i've been digging in it's like christ

2034.08 --> 2037.279
dying for your sins

2036.159 --> 2041.7600000000002
really

2037.279 --> 2041.76
that's contradicting that makes no sense

2043.2 --> 2048.76
and i've just been

2045.12 --> 2048.7599999999998
digging in there

2061.2 --> 2067.7999999999997
back in those days

2063.679 --> 2067.8
weren't so barbaric what

2081.04 --> 2084.96
well if back in those days people

2083.04 --> 2086.96
weren't so barbaric

2084.96 --> 2090.32
then christ might have just turned out

2086.96 --> 2092.879
into just another guy

2090.32 --> 2096.079
right it's the contrast that makes it

2092.879 --> 2099.2
all stand out so much

2096.079 --> 2100.7200000000003
it's the opposition the

2099.2 --> 2102.56
opposer

2100.72 --> 2106.3199999999997
that he became

2102.56 --> 2109.52
in opposition to what else is out there

2106.32 --> 2112.48
right if it wasn't like that

2109.52 --> 2115.28
then he'd probably be like oh oh yeah

2112.48 --> 2116.8
yeah this world's fine

2115.28 --> 2120.1600000000003
i don't know just

2116.8 --> 2120.1600000000003
wild guessing right

2126.56 --> 2134.32
but yeah that time those times were like

2129.76 --> 2134.32
especially the romans were like brutal

2137.599 --> 2142.4
they'd like religiously torture and

2140.48 --> 2145.04
slaughter people

2142.4 --> 2149.48
like of people that they conquered the

2145.04 --> 2149.48
horrible beyond imagining

2176.079 --> 2178.88
oh god

2177.52 --> 2180.079
yeah bob

2178.88 --> 2183.04
sees

2180.079 --> 2186.079
i don't give a [ __ ] dude i don't give a

2183.04 --> 2188.56
fleeting [ __ ] if you think christ never

2186.079 --> 2190.2400000000002
exists he was only ever the son i'm

2188.56 --> 2191.7599999999998
pretty damn sure

2190.24 --> 2194.3199999999997
yeah

2191.76 --> 2195.6800000000003
that the things he said the way he said

2194.32 --> 2198.0
that

2195.68 --> 2200.96
that's a person

2198.0 --> 2203.2
now it probably didn't exactly happen as

2200.96 --> 2205.68
the story was laid down i think it's

2203.2 --> 2208.16
more like a screenplay like that

2205.68 --> 2209.9199999999996
but i'm convinced

2208.16 --> 2212.56
that jesus

2209.92 --> 2214.96
if he was even called that actually was

2212.56 --> 2217.359
a real person and thus the jesus in the

2214.96 --> 2218.56
bible is based

2217.359 --> 2220.96
strongly

2218.56 --> 2224.0789999999997
on a real person

2220.96 --> 2224.079
like the words are

2224.72 --> 2228.52
the the ideas

2241.2 --> 2247.04
yeah stop squirting bob

2244.48 --> 2249.68
yeah you don't know [ __ ]

2247.04 --> 2251.2
you're not digging in

2249.68 --> 2253.9199999999996
right

2251.2 --> 2256.16
you failed like the preliminary test you

2253.92 --> 2258.2000000000003
open the bible you see oh look this

2256.16 --> 2260.8799999999997
represents

2258.2 --> 2264.0789999999997
constellations and

2260.88 --> 2266.6400000000003
the celestial situation that means the

2264.079 --> 2269.599
rest is completely meaningless according

2266.64 --> 2270.48
to you like a gnostic yeah

2269.599 --> 2271.76
that's

2270.48 --> 2274.48
stupid

2271.76 --> 2277.44
that's very short-sighted you just been

2274.48 --> 2280.2400000000002
looking for an excuse

2277.44 --> 2283.04
to think you're smart

2280.24 --> 2285.4399999999996
and then reject every piece of wisdom

2283.04 --> 2287.119
that's actually concealed in there

2285.44 --> 2289.04
that's what you've done

2287.119 --> 2293.56
you understand

2289.04 --> 2293.56
you failed the first test

2316.24 --> 2321.5989999999997
aramaic jesus you're right on the tr yes

2319.28 --> 2325.0400000000004
i've heard a lot about it i'm not to be

2321.599 --> 2327.28
fair i am not personally researching it

2325.04 --> 2330.24
i'm not i'm keeping it

2327.28 --> 2333.76
purely as esoteric like this

2330.24 --> 2335.7599999999998
because i've sensed so much danger

2333.76 --> 2338.2400000000002
in the purity because what i'm doing

2335.76 --> 2339.5200000000004
inside of me this esoterics my journey

2338.24 --> 2342.3999999999996
is

2339.52 --> 2345.44
really delicate

2342.4 --> 2348.0
but i'm definitely interested in people

2345.44 --> 2349.359
that are trying to dig that

2348.0 --> 2352.88
into that

2349.359 --> 2355.68
i think that adamican is digging into

2352.88 --> 2357.04
that concept

2355.68 --> 2359.44
and he's been

2357.04 --> 2360.96
handing me very interesting pieces of

2359.44 --> 2362.16
information

2360.96 --> 2364.079
oh oh

2362.16 --> 2365.92
really i'm just going to leave that

2364.079 --> 2368.92
there for a second

2365.92 --> 2368.92
so

2369.839 --> 2375.7599999999998
you really think you're not gonna be

2371.839 --> 2375.7599999999998
banned when you do that in my chat bob

2375.839 --> 2378.32
clutch

2379.52 --> 2382.72
okay well

2380.96 --> 2385.76
i guess

2382.72 --> 2387.52
you you got ahead of me but seriously

2385.76 --> 2389.119
yeah it's too late now dude you've

2387.52 --> 2390.8
already been

2389.119 --> 2394.04
i was gonna ban him anyway it's just

2390.8 --> 2394.04
like what

2396.8 --> 2402.48
so i tell you you failed the first test

2399.599 --> 2403.839
by excluding the wisdom value of what

2402.48 --> 2406.96
was within

2403.839 --> 2410.88
because you found a structure relating

2406.96 --> 2413.76
to the celestials within the bible story

2410.88 --> 2416.96
and that was an excuse for you to

2413.76 --> 2419.0400000000004
completely reject everything else

2416.96 --> 2420.64
and now i'm a clown

2419.04 --> 2423.64
am i

2420.64 --> 2423.64
bob

2424.72 --> 2429.5989999999997
sounds like you're projecting a bit

2426.4 --> 2431.119
sounds like you actually did just now

2429.599 --> 2433.04
face

2431.119 --> 2435.119
what i said

2433.04 --> 2436.4
and then realized that you didn't want

2435.119 --> 2439.599
to accept

2436.4 --> 2443.6800000000003
that reality so you're projecting unto

2439.599 --> 2443.6800000000003
me could that be the case bob

2444.0 --> 2449.16
anyway we'll probably never know because

2445.92 --> 2449.16
you're banned

2461.2 --> 2465.52
no it's fine clutch

2463.52 --> 2468.24
i was actually good i just wanted to

2465.52 --> 2469.92
leave it visible there

2468.24 --> 2472.64
for a moment

2469.92 --> 2472.64
that it's fine

2474.56 --> 2479.119
i'm just disappointed that he he didn't

2477.28 --> 2481.44
actually listen

2479.119 --> 2483.92
so apparently he did just did come here

2481.44 --> 2483.92
to troll

2491.04 --> 2497.7599999999998
or maybe he just hoped for some kind of

2493.52 --> 2499.2
anti-christian squirt opportunity here

2497.76 --> 2501.0400000000004
because i bet there's a whole bunch of

2499.2 --> 2503.359
rumors spreading

2501.04 --> 2504.88
and christians talking in their little

2503.359 --> 2507.119
private rooms

2504.88 --> 2509.44
like oh that arwen how dares he is

2507.119 --> 2513.599
secretly an antichrist

2509.44 --> 2513.599
apostle or blah blah whatever

2514.16 --> 2520.0
and that's gonna grab the attention of

2516.72 --> 2523.04
people that kind of hate christians

2520.0 --> 2526.56
that act like that and that have kind of

2523.04 --> 2528.24
like over focused on that hatred and

2526.56 --> 2531.52
lost interest

2528.24 --> 2531.52
in jesus because of it

2531.92 --> 2537.359
because of the people

2533.52 --> 2539.44
that claim to be his followers

2537.359 --> 2541.839
and that probably genuinely think they

2539.44 --> 2543.2000000000003
are his followers and that tried to be

2541.839 --> 2545.599
his follower

2543.2 --> 2548.96
but they don't understand that

2545.599 --> 2551.44
the content that they use

2548.96 --> 2552.96
to follow

2551.44 --> 2555.76
it

2552.96 --> 2559.4
it doesn't actually match

2555.76 --> 2559.4
christ's words

2577.04 --> 2581.2
he said he was here for flat earth not

2578.72 --> 2585.04
religion yeah i'm sorry it's just right

2581.2 --> 2588.3999999999996
now religion is kind of under the scope

2585.04 --> 2591.56
i mean i can't talk about flat earth

2588.4 --> 2591.56
of course

2593.359 --> 2597.5989999999997
if you have a question about that i'll

2595.04 --> 2599.52
answer it it's just that this is right

2597.599 --> 2601.44
now kind of like

2599.52 --> 2604.44
weighing on me and i need to deal with

2601.44 --> 2604.44
it

2610.319 --> 2613.52
right yeah pj khrushchev totally agree

2612.319 --> 2616.8
with that

2613.52 --> 2620.24
like that i think jesus existed despite

2616.8 --> 2622.2400000000002
what use think

2620.24 --> 2624.16
i don't know if he was exactly how

2622.24 --> 2626.0789999999997
portrayed in the bible but

2624.16 --> 2628.48
beli you certainly believe in his

2626.079 --> 2630.88
teachings and what he stood for right

2628.48 --> 2632.839
as i said i think that the bible is

2630.88 --> 2635.28
basically a

2632.839 --> 2638.48
play based

2635.28 --> 2639.8390000000004
on a real person and his real story his

2638.48 --> 2641.44
real words

2639.839 --> 2643.52
were kind of

2641.44 --> 2646.2400000000002
the play was

2643.52 --> 2649.28
created centered around

2646.24 --> 2652.0789999999997
that character like he was used as an

2649.28 --> 2654.2400000000002
inspiration it's almost like

2652.079 --> 2657.52
this might sound really weird no

2654.24 --> 2660.0
disrespect meant whatsoever this is just

2657.52 --> 2662.24
a clean comparison

2660.0 --> 2663.92
it reminds me of when i was a gay master

2662.24 --> 2665.839
with my gamers

2663.92 --> 2668.2400000000002
and players and even me

2665.839 --> 2669.2799999999997
would create characters

2668.24 --> 2671.839
based

2669.28 --> 2675.44
on real people or like

2671.839 --> 2677.359
even fake people acts actors

2675.44 --> 2679.28
that or a certain character in a movie

2677.359 --> 2682.0
that's like really cool and you wanted

2679.28 --> 2684.48
to emulate it so you use

2682.0 --> 2685.599
that emulation of something that is out

2684.48 --> 2688.0
there

2685.599 --> 2690.88
and you put it in the story and then it

2688.0 --> 2693.76
integrates right i think that jesus was

2690.88 --> 2694.96
actually a real person out there and he

2693.76 --> 2696.8
was

2694.96 --> 2701.68
used

2696.8 --> 2701.6800000000003
and a story was created around him

2703.2 --> 2709.04
right because when we emulate like a

2706.319 --> 2713.04
a movie character then of course we're

2709.04 --> 2715.52
gonna use their vernacular their typical

2713.04 --> 2716.319
sentences because that's what makes them

2715.52 --> 2718.96
right

2716.319 --> 2721.04
if it's not like that then yeah you kind

2718.96 --> 2723.2
of lose track it's not

2721.04 --> 2725.68
an emulation of the character anymore in

2723.2 --> 2725.68
the game

2729.52 --> 2734.24
that's what i think so i think jesus was

2731.76 --> 2736.6400000000003
an absolutely a real person because of

2734.24 --> 2739.5989999999997
the cohesion of the wisdom the fractal

2736.64 --> 2741.04
insight you can't just create that in

2739.599 --> 2743.44
nothing

2741.04 --> 2747.48
had to cut somebody had to

2743.44 --> 2747.48
have that wisdom

2758.24 --> 2763.5989999999997
yeah george sanford you need to stop it

2761.44 --> 2765.599
look what you are doing is

2763.599 --> 2767.52
straight out slander

2765.599 --> 2770.1600000000003
i do not care for it

2767.52 --> 2772.48
yeah it's not what i'm doing here

2770.16 --> 2775.359
this is not about you [ __ ] on

2772.48 --> 2777.119
everything and being like oh see i knew

2775.359 --> 2779.92
it was all fake

2777.119 --> 2782.6400000000003
i'm going to [ __ ] on there and [ __ ] on

2779.92 --> 2785.28
it more and [ __ ] on it no if that's what

2782.64 --> 2788.64
you're doing here get the [ __ ] off

2785.28 --> 2790.96
i mean it [ __ ] off dude

2788.64 --> 2792.64
we don't need you to [ __ ]

2790.96 --> 2794.16
on jesus yeah

2792.64 --> 2798.0789999999997
that's not what i'm doing here i'm

2794.16 --> 2798.0789999999997
trying to unravel this thing

2799.68 --> 2803.7599999999998
you've seen this similarity yeah no [ __ ]

2802.319 --> 2805.7599999999998
sherlock

2803.76 --> 2809.28
george sanford i've been talking about

2805.76 --> 2811.119
that for a year at least

2809.28 --> 2813.92
i already stated yeah

2811.119 --> 2817.119
the patterns the similarities absolutely

2813.92 --> 2819.599
absolutely absolutely i know it doesn't

2817.119 --> 2822.8
make it fake you idiot

2819.599 --> 2825.6800000000003
again failing the first test

2822.8 --> 2827.6800000000003
you're an idiot george sanford you're

2825.68 --> 2830.72
failing it

2827.68 --> 2833.5989999999997
and you've become just a [ __ ] demon

2830.72 --> 2835.2799999999997
[ __ ] on it like an idiot like a

2833.599 --> 2838.6400000000003
degenerate

2835.28 --> 2838.6400000000003
don't you see what you're doing

2840.96 --> 2845.079
you have no respect

2865.359 --> 2867.5989999999997
uh

2868.4 --> 2873.839
okay science works in materials way

2870.079 --> 2873.8390000000004
that's kind of creepy

2892.24 --> 2894.5589999999997
right

2896.16 --> 2899.52
yeah the mahabharata

2898.16 --> 2901.52
fascinating

2899.52 --> 2903.599
ancient

2901.52 --> 2906.079
did you know there's actually a movie

2903.599 --> 2909.76
about that very long

2906.079 --> 2912.48
that's a like an attempt to

2909.76 --> 2914.0
portray like a certain story from it i

2912.48 --> 2916.88
saw that when i was really young and

2914.0 --> 2920.16
that made like a massive impression on

2916.88 --> 2922.559
me like it scared me because it got so

2920.16 --> 2922.5589999999997
close

2923.359 --> 2928.52
and it was like so ancient and mystical

2929.68 --> 2934.04
i haven't seen that in forever

2959.52 --> 2963.68
all right anyway guys i'm glad you're

2961.119 --> 2965.92
getting along

2963.68 --> 2965.9199999999996
some

2968.839 --> 2973.04
relief i was really worried

2974.0 --> 2980.119
am i doing the right thing

2976.16 --> 2980.1189999999997
am i doing the right thing

2984.16 --> 2988.0
you're a little disappointed when

2985.599 --> 2990.1600000000003
watching sci-fi movies wealthier they're

2988.0 --> 2991.92
all a lick of each

2990.16 --> 2994.48
which ones

2991.92 --> 2996.96
oh after learning yeah yeah that yeah

2994.48 --> 2998.64
yeah the first period is

2996.96 --> 3001.04
a big transition

2998.64 --> 3003.1189999999997
it's shocking you realize oh my god it's

3001.04 --> 3005.359
all polluted right that's what it feels

3003.119 --> 3005.359
like

3006.64 --> 3009.04
if

3007.52 --> 3010.88
you get through it

3009.04 --> 3012.72
and you don't build up too much

3010.88 --> 3014.079
resentment

3012.72 --> 3016.0789999999997
against

3014.079 --> 3017.599
the spell of the globe

3016.079 --> 3020.4
then you might

3017.599 --> 3022.96
partially learn to appreciate it even

3020.4 --> 3024.8
after you find out about flat earth it

3022.96 --> 3027.04
takes a while

3024.8 --> 3028.079
i personally have kind of tried to

3027.04 --> 3030.5589999999997
promote

3028.079 --> 3032.48
a dual cosmogonical society

3030.559 --> 3034.7200000000003
where the dream could be

3032.48 --> 3037.2
upheld

3034.72 --> 3040.5589999999997
not used to

3037.2 --> 3041.839
to destroy people's minds

3040.559 --> 3045.52
and spirit

3041.839 --> 3046.319
but instead to just be like a live

3045.52 --> 3048.88
big

3046.319 --> 3052.319
human story an idea more like the

3048.88 --> 3055.2000000000003
original futurism not away from god and

3052.319 --> 3056.96
conscious that it's about a test

3055.2 --> 3058.7999999999997
you grow up you're confronted with it

3056.96 --> 3061.44
and then you're tested

3058.8 --> 3062.8
like do you understand

3061.44 --> 3064.559
what this is

3062.8 --> 3066.6400000000003
do you understand that's not actually

3064.559 --> 3069.599
real and then you point out at the like

3066.64 --> 3070.48
the actual physics facts and all that

3069.599 --> 3072.4
right

3070.48 --> 3074.64
the flat earth debate

3072.4 --> 3077.6800000000003
can you handle it

3074.64 --> 3077.68
that it's like a test

3079.92 --> 3083.92
that was kind of my original angle to

3082.24 --> 3087.5989999999997
things because i don't think like the

3083.92 --> 3087.599
globe can really go away

3090.4 --> 3095.44
like i think that if

3092.24 --> 3097.68
if it's even possible to somehow erase

3095.44 --> 3102.16
it from the world

3097.68 --> 3102.16
it would just be reinvented from scratch

3105.28 --> 3109.0400000000004
and then they have like a true

3106.88 --> 3111.28
persecution history

3109.04 --> 3113.52
they're gonna feel more like martiers

3111.28 --> 3113.52
then

3113.68 --> 3118.5589999999997
it's actually quite dangerous

3115.839 --> 3119.68
to try to get it out

3118.559 --> 3124.8390000000004
but

3119.68 --> 3124.839
yeah that's just my thoughts about it

3141.359 --> 3146.0789999999997
krishna was the ultimate rebel yeah bri

3143.599 --> 3149.44
krishna is yeah

3146.079 --> 3149.44
it's very close to christ

3149.92 --> 3153.839
very similar in ways

3167.76 --> 3171.4
hey fled bastard

3214.96 --> 3217.96
hmm

3222.16 --> 3225.2
wow there's a whole lot of conversation

3223.76 --> 3228.079
going on it's

3225.2 --> 3231.0789999999997
getting a little difficult to follow

3228.079 --> 3231.079
alone

3236.72 --> 3242.0789999999997
yeah yeah matthew yeah dude it's like

3239.599 --> 3243.2000000000003

i even mentioned it yesterday on the

3246.24 --> 3253.16
on the after show

3249.2 --> 3253.16

3269.359 --> 3274.68
god

3270.24 --> 3274.68
to see what you can what

3285.76 --> 3290.96

huh

3553.92 --> 3559.319
hmm i'll check it out that's that looks

3556.319 --> 3559.319

what are you talking about who are you

3672.079 --> 3675.6400000000003
talking to

3690.0 --> 3695.04
look if you're gonna go into a back and

3692.64 --> 3698.48
forth conversation with somebody else in

3695.04 --> 3700.96
chat could you please address their name

3698.48 --> 3703.359
in what you're saying it's making it

3700.96 --> 3706.079
really confusing for me to follow what

3703.359 --> 3706.0789999999997
you're all saying

3708.4 --> 3712.64
any recommendations for a good sextant i

3710.799 --> 3715.119
don't know ask 10th man he knows

3712.64 --> 3719.319
everything about that

3715.119 --> 3719.319
he's got several i think

3738.559 --> 3743.3190000000004
now science works mr no you're fine

3766.0 --> 3769.839
what

3767.599 --> 3774.6800000000003
got my mind thinking now about the

3769.839 --> 3774.68
t-shirt thing what t-shirt thing what

3808.799 --> 3813.44
huh

3811.119 --> 3816.88
oh really isles whoa

3813.44 --> 3816.88
interesting i'll check it out

3817.44 --> 3821.2000000000003
later today

3819.119 --> 3824.599
like perhaps i could check it out now

3821.2 --> 3824.5989999999997
it's just that

3825.039 --> 3829.44
i don't know what it's like i like to

3827.68 --> 3831.359
hear the

3829.44 --> 3833.599
especially if it's songs i'd like to

3831.359 --> 3837.16
hear them before i decide whether to

3833.599 --> 3837.1600000000003
play them live

3845.359 --> 3848.92
mother of all

3855.92 --> 3859.599
all right yeah science works a

3857.599 --> 3863.6800000000003
mysterious way thanks for being part of

3859.599 --> 3863.6800000000003
the chat i'll see you tomorrow i hope

3864.0 --> 3869.28
how do i ask 10th man uh

3867.76 --> 3871.6800000000003
i think you could probably send him an

3869.28 --> 3873.3590000000004
email or something i don't know i just

3871.68 --> 3876.48
communicate with him through chat

3873.359 --> 3876.48
through skype chat

3879.359 --> 3884.96
i mean if you contact me on skype the

3881.599 --> 3887.2000000000003
address is in the description box i will

3884.96 --> 3887.2
like

3887.28 --> 3891.88
bring you into contact with him

3915.92 --> 3918.92
so

3922.079 --> 3926.2400000000002
oh is it good clutch

3923.92 --> 3928.16
ah now i'm really curious

3926.24 --> 3932.0789999999997
but out of principle i just can't just

3928.16 --> 3932.0789999999997
raw play something if i haven't heard it

3934.799 --> 3937.599
if it's really that good then maybe i'll

3936.64 --> 3941.839
start

3937.599 --> 3941.839
out tomorrow playing it all right

3944.24 --> 3950.2799999999997
i think i'm gonna listen to this right

3946.0 --> 3950.28
after i round out my show

3955.44 --> 3958.44
so

3982.88 --> 3989.0
eight songs jesus

3984.799 --> 3989.0
all right you've been busy

3995.76 --> 3998.4
oh man

4003.68 --> 4007.7599999999998
it's kind of weird like when i feel

4006.72 --> 4010.48
like

4007.76 --> 4013.8390000000004
i'm tired but i'm not tired

4010.48 --> 4015.359
i had a great night's sleep like great

4013.839 --> 4016.64
i got up

4015.359 --> 4019.2799999999997
well

4016.64 --> 4019.2799999999997
ahead of the

4019.599 --> 4023.2000000000003
it's show there's something about the

4021.119 --> 4027.2000000000003
weather right now

4023.2 --> 4030.52
this next it's kind of some tiresomeness

4027.2 --> 4030.52
it's weird

4043.28 --> 4049.2000000000003
oh by the way also watch owen

4046.839 --> 4051.839
benjamin from yesterday's stream and it

4049.2 --> 4051.839
was great

4057.039 --> 4060.3190000000004
and of course

4059.039 --> 4063.2000000000003
i was on

4060.319 --> 4065.7599999999998
oh i was in the chat over at jim bob's

4063.2 --> 4069.0789999999997
again that guy just keeps on doing it

4065.76 --> 4069.079
what he does

4091.599 --> 4094.2400000000002
what is this

4094.96 --> 4098.119
oh yeah

4110.88 --> 4113.1990000000005
hmm

4117.6 --> 4122.88
right well clutch we we're not getting

4119.759 --> 4126.159
any snow here anytime soon i think

4122.88 --> 4128.56
it's still well under

4126.159 --> 4130.7
freezing temperature

4128.56 --> 4132.56
i mean well above

4130.7 --> 4135.2789999999995
[Applause]

4132.56 --> 4138.96
oh it's 10 degrees though that's like

4135.279 --> 4138.96
the coldest it's been for a while

4140.4 --> 4145.48
maybe that's

4142.0 --> 4145.48
what i'm feeling

4152.719 --> 4157.88
you can't get into made by jimbo

4160.96 --> 4165.44
well maybe he thinks you're like a fake

4163.12 --> 4165.44
bear

4166.799 --> 4170.159
because you behave

4168.239 --> 4172.5599999999995
i don't know maybe a little like a gamma

4170.159 --> 4175.839
at some point it's difficult but i'll

4172.56 --> 4175.839000000001
ask him

4179.759 --> 4185.719
i'm not saying you're a gamma by the way

4181.839 --> 4185.719
you've been very nice

4200.48 --> 4204.48
chopping wood getting ready for the

4201.92 --> 4204.4800000000005
white stuff

4206.96 --> 4209.199
yeah

4208.08 --> 4212.719
great idea

4209.199 --> 4215.199
oh man i've been like smelling

4212.719 --> 4217.76
some wood fires out here and it really

4215.199 --> 4219.5199999999995
is exhilarating i don't know what that

4217.76 --> 4222.08
is it's just that like

4219.52 --> 4222.080000000001
oh yeah

4223.04 --> 4225.84
freshly burned

4224.64 --> 4229.4800000000005
wood

4225.84 --> 4229.4800000000005
what a great smell

4231.679 --> 4236.08
i really love wood fires i haven't

4233.44 --> 4238.32
really been

4236.08 --> 4242.199
at any wood fire in a long time and i

4238.32 --> 4242.199
miss it a lot

4252.96 --> 4257.199
oh

4254.32 --> 4258.48
oh you you can't get into his show you

4257.199 --> 4260.96
don't like it

4258.48 --> 4260.959999999999
why not

4263.6 --> 4269.88
that's weird

4265.04 --> 4269.88
well that i guess tastes are different

4273.36 --> 4277.04
i just i really appreciate

4277.92 --> 4282.2390000000005
jim bob's

4279.36 --> 4283.92
insightfulness he's very insightful and

4282.239 --> 4285.12
kind of

4283.92 --> 4288.0
similar

4285.12 --> 4290.4
feels similar to what i do

4288.0 --> 4293.679
he really tries to

4290.4 --> 4296.159
tackle complicated bigger things and is

4293.679 --> 4298.2390000000005
pretty good in like creating

4296.159 --> 4299.28
oversight

4298.239 --> 4300.879999999999
right

4299.28 --> 4302.88
that's rare

4300.88 --> 4306.0
i really appreciate that about him it's

4302.88 --> 4306.0
not flawless though

4309.04 --> 4313.159
but yeah neither am i

4324.88 --> 4330.08
but he's certainly getting a lot into

4327.679 --> 4331.84
like flat earth mechanics and it's like

4330.08 --> 4334.4
going through all the subjects like

4331.84 --> 4334.400000000001
gravity

4336.32 --> 4341.12
housekeeping questions is very flat

4338.64 --> 4344.8
earth debate oriented overall

4341.12 --> 4347.36
and he like reflects it perfectly

4344.8 --> 4350.56
and even digs through better

4347.36 --> 4353.799999999999
like questions sub questions within it i

4350.56 --> 4353.8
like that

4358.08 --> 4361.36
all right clutch

4360.08 --> 4363.92
well

4361.36 --> 4363.92
that's cool

4364.8 --> 4370.719
you like my show and own benjamins but

4367.6 --> 4373.1990000000005
not his all right well that

4370.719 --> 4375.44
you don't have to worry about it

4373.199 --> 4377.36
you know sometimes it's like everybody i

4375.44 --> 4380.32
hang around with they all like this

4377.36 --> 4384.639999999999
person and i'm like i don't like him i

4380.32 --> 4388.08
can't even explain why i just don't like

4384.64 --> 4388.08
that just happens sometimes

4390.32 --> 4394.239
yeah the voices are hilarious i also and

4393.12 --> 4398.36
he's

4394.239 --> 4398.36
very consistent with him

4405.6 --> 4408.0
all right

4411.52 --> 4418.0
you can stare into wood fire for well i

4414.08 --> 4420.159
i can't stare i have to like i become

4418.0 --> 4422.719
fire manager

4420.159 --> 4426.239
like i basically start automatically

4422.719 --> 4429.76
building an oven

4426.239 --> 4431.12
i i have to do it i have to do it

4429.76 --> 4433.12
i can't help it

4431.12 --> 4436.08
because you can make a fire in such a

4433.12 --> 4439.04
way that it will literally just radiate

4436.08 --> 4440.719
radiate incredible heat and not quickly

4439.04 --> 4442.0
burn out

4440.719 --> 4444.159
and i

4442.0 --> 4447.199
i've done this so much throughout my

4444.159 --> 4450.799999999999
life starting at a very young age i am a

4447.199 --> 4453.199
fire master i am it's undisputable

4450.8 --> 4455.84
undisputable you you could test me on

4453.199 --> 4459.12
this you could check you could test me

4455.84 --> 4462.159000000001
i'll do it i'll show you

4459.12 --> 4465.04
oh and i can literally

4462.159 --> 4468.32
pick red hot coals out of the fire with

4465.04 --> 4471.44
my bare hands without burning them try

4468.32 --> 4471.44
and do that huh

4473.28 --> 4477.8
it requires a very special trick

4483.44 --> 4486.96
it's not like i grab down on them i'm

4485.6 --> 4488.8
not an idiot

4486.96 --> 4492.719
i know how to do it

4488.8 --> 4492.719
because i'm not afraid of fire like that

4492.8 --> 4497.84
i i get

4494.239 --> 4497.839999999999
wood fire very well

4515.199 --> 4519.839999999999
fire master

4516.44 --> 4522.08
thermodynamics magician

4519.84 --> 4522.08
uh

4523.44 --> 4530.32
no

4525.12 --> 4532.719
no it's just understanding the nature of

4530.32 --> 4534.96
like radiant heat

4532.719 --> 4536.64
from

4534.96 --> 4539.36
well from

4536.64 --> 4540.8
glowing coals if you understand how that

4539.36 --> 4543.599999999999
heat works

4540.8 --> 4547.52
you'd be surprised

4543.6 --> 4547.52
and i really learned to understand it

4550.48 --> 4555.678999999999
also i and maybe yeah i'm a goldsmith

4553.44 --> 4556.719
and i've used that i've used

4555.679 --> 4559.4400000000005
that

4556.719 --> 4560.96
i just i can handle heat as long as it's

4559.44 --> 4563.04
not like super

4560.96 --> 4565.36
heated metal right if it's super heated

4563.04 --> 4566.48
metal don't

4565.36 --> 4568.719
that's

4566.48 --> 4570.879999999999
yeah you can't

4568.719 --> 4573.44
because it's very quickly

4570.88 --> 4574.8
very quickly it just

4573.44 --> 4576.4
that painful

4574.8 --> 4578.320000000001
everybody's probably burned themselves

4576.4 --> 4581.04
at one point like that it's like you

4578.32 --> 4584.159
don't it's just a fraction of a second

4581.04 --> 4585.44
and and you got a burden right

4584.159 --> 4587.199
hot coals

4585.44 --> 4590.48
is different

4587.199 --> 4590.48
but there's a trick to it

4593.52 --> 4596.4800000000005
right

4594.96 --> 4598.4800000000005
yeah besides

4596.48 --> 4601.678999999999
it's it's kind of the same trick that

4598.48 --> 4604.0
allows you to walk over hot coals with

4601.679 --> 4606.8
your bare feet

4604.0 --> 4608.48
now i don't particularly like doing that

4606.8 --> 4610.320000000001
just for the record

4608.48 --> 4612.799999999999
but my hands

4610.32 --> 4615.28
yeah i can work

4612.8 --> 4618.56
with fire not but i don't like to walk

4615.28 --> 4618.5599999999995
it if you know what i mean

4618.88 --> 4624.64
but it is possible to do that without

4621.76 --> 4627.52
burning your feet because of this effect

4624.64 --> 4629.1990000000005
it's kind of counterintuitive

4627.52 --> 4634.76
do you have a s

4629.199 --> 4634.759999999999
have a spot to have a fire no i don't

4654.96 --> 4659.28
freshly sliced onions on a burn

4659.92 --> 4663.4400000000005
okay

4661.28 --> 4665.84
oh i like aloe vera

4663.44 --> 4667.5199999999995
omega genesis that

4665.84 --> 4670.52
that is to be

4667.52 --> 4670.52
better

4716.32 --> 4720.5199999999995
try onion you'll be amazed

4721.52 --> 4727.280000000001
okay if i if i can think of it when it

4723.76 --> 4729.76
happens i very very rarely burn myself

4727.28 --> 4733.12
it's like it did just happen by the way

4729.76 --> 4735.679
by accident like a week ago

4733.12 --> 4737.44
because of stupid oven

4735.679 --> 4738.96
like i touched

4737.44 --> 4741.599999999999
the glass

4738.96 --> 4745.44
and it was really freaking hot

4741.6 --> 4747.120000000001
just for like a microsecond and it hurt

4745.44 --> 4750.879999999999
because it wasn't like

4747.12 --> 4753.599999999999
on the inside because the inside is like

4750.88 --> 4756.96
almost impervious to heat

4753.6 --> 4760.280000000001
the outside is not

4756.96 --> 4760.28
that hurt

4784.88 --> 4787.88
huh

4792.48 --> 4796.799999999999
oh that's cool clutch

4794.4 --> 4798.96
that's great if you can have load plants

4796.8 --> 4801.84
that actually

4798.96 --> 4802.8
like it usually they only do well

4801.84 --> 4803.76
in

4802.8 --> 4806.320000000001
like

4803.76 --> 4809.4400000000005
tropic or subtropic regions where they

4806.32 --> 4811.44
get a lot of sun

4809.44 --> 4812.879999999999
and then they become really big and

4811.44 --> 4814.799999999999
juicy

4812.88 --> 4818.36
but if it's too cold they tend to kind

4814.8 --> 4818.360000000001
of go rot

4820.4 --> 4825.679
like the netherlands is not the ideal

4822.239 --> 4827.36
place to to grow them

4825.679 --> 4830.76
unless you're doing it on

4827.36 --> 4830.759999999999
yeah inside

4836.8 --> 4840.92
like they're almost like cacti

4853.12 --> 4858.639
maybe i can have a fireside chat out

4856.4 --> 4860.879999999999
yeah i don't know how to do that i don't

4858.639 --> 4864.32
have any mobile streaming and i don't

4860.88 --> 4865.92
have any fireplace outside so

4864.32 --> 4868.159
yeah

4865.92 --> 4871.96
dude if i had one i'd be

4868.159 --> 4871.96
doing that a lot

4917.84 --> 4920.84
right

4954.159 --> 4959.44
what is the cross a religious symbol

4956.56 --> 4959.4400000000005
before jesus

4959.84 --> 4962.96
or what kind of cross

4971.04 --> 4978.0
i mean like the the celtic cross

4973.679 --> 4978.0
celtic cro cross was kind of a

4980.4 --> 4984.96
like a free sextant kind of thing so

4982.96 --> 4987.84
there were all kinds of

4984.96 --> 4987.84
crosses

4989.52 --> 4994.56
like even

4991.76 --> 4999.2390000000005
in religious symbols symbols that were

4994.56 --> 4999.2390000000005
used for practical purposes

5001.52 --> 5003.76
uh

5013.28 --> 5018.88
but i don't i like when did

5016.56 --> 5020.639
christianity first even start to

5018.88 --> 5023.1990000000005
associate

5020.639 --> 5024.639
like wearing a cross

5023.199 --> 5026.638999999999
like a necklace

5024.639 --> 5029.28
when did that even first start because

5026.639 --> 5031.84
that definitely did not start right

5029.28 --> 5034.159
after jesus

5031.84 --> 5034.159000000001
right

5034.239 --> 5040.04
when did that actually first come in

5037.04 --> 5040.04
historically

5053.84 --> 5058.719
for navigation yeah but that's the the

5055.92 --> 5058.719
celtic cross

5061.12 --> 5064.92
it's not the same cross

5094.88 --> 5100.639
right but i'll see it would fit

5097.679 --> 5102.56
the typical assimilation effort

5100.639 --> 5104.88
that the whole

5102.56 --> 5106.639
catholic apparatus

5104.88 --> 5109.1990000000005
has been doing

5106.639 --> 5112.159000000001
taking another symbol from another

5109.199 --> 5113.5199999999995
religion and then making it like forcing

5112.159 --> 5115.44
it

5113.52 --> 5118.320000000001
in there

5115.44 --> 5118.32
and changing it

5120.8 --> 5125.76
celtic cross is a symbol of eternal is

5123.52 --> 5126.719
it what

5125.76 --> 5129.719
what

5126.719 --> 5129.719
how

5175.679 --> 5178.679
um

5183.28 --> 5186.96
catholic church is a political

5184.8 --> 5189.1990000000005
organization created by the roman m well

5186.96 --> 5191.04
that's one way of saying it but yeah

5189.199 --> 5192.32
that's roughly what it would come down

5191.04 --> 5195.44
to

5192.32 --> 5197.84
it certainly seems to be political in

5195.44 --> 5201.599999999999
endless amounts of ways

5197.84 --> 5204.0
always the assimilation always

5201.6 --> 5208.120000000001
in the early stages especially every

5204.0 --> 5208.12
time they've done that

5218.48 --> 5222.718999999999
all right clutch yeah thanks yeah i do

5221.04 --> 5224.159
think it was a good show i

5222.719 --> 5226.159
at least i'm gonna have a little bit

5224.159 --> 5227.28
more peace of mind and heart

5226.159 --> 5229.199
today

5227.28 --> 5233.12
after this

5229.199 --> 5236.5599999999995
but yeah it's typical isn't it

5233.12 --> 5240.88
i get rowdy in the show

5236.56 --> 5242.719
i like put down bird this dude

5240.88 --> 5244.2390000000005
this and that you didn't die for your

5242.719 --> 5246.08
sin damn it

5244.239 --> 5248.0
and then people get outraged and then

5246.08 --> 5249.28
the next day i'm like oh [ __ ] what did i

5248.0 --> 5250.32
do

5249.28 --> 5252.96
but not

5250.32 --> 5255.04
like oh my god regrets but just like ah

5252.96 --> 5257.36
what do i do with this

5255.04 --> 5259.76
what did i do wrong what did i do right

5257.36 --> 5261.5199999999995
and then i just go through it in detail

5259.76 --> 5263.52
and like ugh

5261.52 --> 5265.6
i gotta fix this i could like what

5263.52 --> 5268.88
happened

5265.6 --> 5272.159000000001
and how can i like improve

5268.88 --> 5273.76
what how can i improve myself and

5272.159 --> 5275.44
what was it that it was actually trying

5273.76 --> 5278.719
to do because a lot of these things when

5275.44 --> 5281.12
i do it like that is very impulsive

5278.719 --> 5282.88
on my side

5281.12 --> 5285.12
because i can be like extremely

5282.88 --> 5288.0
impulsive and then i'm like very defiant

5285.12 --> 5290.96
i'm like oh oh oh you don't want to hear

5288.0 --> 5293.28
this part uh i'm just gonna throw it out

5290.96 --> 5295.84
there like uh uh oh i did it i did it

5293.28 --> 5297.36
what you gonna do now huh

5295.84 --> 5299.4400000000005
but then the next day i feel less

5297.36 --> 5300.799999999999
defined i'm like oh [ __ ] what did i just

5299.44 --> 5304.32
do

5300.8 --> 5306.639
but i still i would never do something

5304.32 --> 5308.5599999999995
that i would know ahead of time i was

5306.639 --> 5310.32
gonna really regret

5308.56 --> 5311.360000000001
because that just makes you look really

5310.32 --> 5314.639
stupid

5311.36 --> 5317.36
i can't retract anything because i don't

5314.639 --> 5319.6
allow myself to put anything forward

5317.36 --> 5321.599999999999
that i would have to retract because i

5319.6 --> 5323.679
will know that

5321.6 --> 5326.56
i know ahead of time

5323.679 --> 5329.679
what it is on an intuitive level i just

5326.56 --> 5331.6
my cognition always catches up

5329.679 --> 5334.0
with my intuition and that's what i'm

5331.6 --> 5337.719
doing today

5334.0 --> 5337.719
going through it again

5359.36 --> 5363.36
eternal life and that's when they felt

5361.44 --> 5365.199
immortality their own

5363.36 --> 5369.12
what

5365.199 --> 5369.12
all right hello that is odd

5370.0 --> 5373.44
that yeah that is odd

5374.0 --> 5377.36
interesting though you have any picture

5376.08 --> 5379.84
of that

5377.36 --> 5379.839999999999
that place

5380.08 --> 5383.76
like maybe there's just something about

5381.76 --> 5384.88
that place and it's the cross that kind

5383.76 --> 5387.6
of like

5384.88 --> 5391.400000000001
draws it out of the ground or something

5387.6 --> 5391.400000000001
maybe it's something electromagnetic

5394.159 --> 5398.08
but interesting

5396.88 --> 5401.52
like is it

5398.08 --> 5401.5199999999995
how old is that thing

5402.8 --> 5407.6
is it ancient or did they just put it up

5405.44 --> 5410.599999999999
there somewhere in the last 50 years or

5407.6 --> 5410.6
something

5459.679 --> 5465.84
rather

5460.84 --> 5465.84
new do that oh okay that's really new

5470.48 --> 5476.44
hmm

5472.239 --> 5476.44
okay lp yeah interesting

5494.8 --> 5498.88
what mini stonehenge

5498.0 --> 5503.08
what

5498.88 --> 5503.08
else you never heard of that

5506.48 --> 5510.04
where is that located

5518.08 --> 5523.84
like in the netherlands by the way we

5519.6 --> 5527.92
got similar things we got hunibada

5523.84 --> 5530.32
or hon bets whatever you would translate

5527.92 --> 5533.52
that too

5530.32 --> 5535.28
and they are said to be graves

5533.52 --> 5538.639
but i don't know if there's it's more

5535.28 --> 5540.88
like a testimony stone or something

5538.639 --> 5543.6
there's some of those in the netherlands

5540.88 --> 5545.4400000000005
really odd

5543.6 --> 5547.280000000001
and those are ancient

5545.44 --> 5550.08
like really old

5547.28 --> 5553.199
what's going on with fed lately i don't

5550.08 --> 5554.8
know it's just doing what it does steamy

5553.199 --> 5558.28
traveler

5554.8 --> 5558.28
what's the issue

5566.8 --> 5569.8
nope

5582.08 --> 5586.96
right i'll show you the

5584.719 --> 5588.56
maybe it's very similar to that what

5586.96 --> 5590.0
you've seen

5588.56 --> 5593.679
because the huni better kind of look

5590.0 --> 5597.159
like a mini stonehenge too

5593.679 --> 5597.159
i'll show you

5609.199 --> 5612.199
uh

5625.04 --> 5628.6
right see

5642.719 --> 5648.08
weird isn't it

5645.04 --> 5648.08
and they're really small

5649.44 --> 5653.48
and there's a lot of them apparently

5662.639 --> 5666.4800000000005
megaliths no no they're not that huge

5665.44 --> 5669.599999999999
but

5666.48 --> 5671.44
they are really old apparently it's not

5669.6 --> 5675.719
just something they cooked up like in

5671.44 --> 5675.719
the last 100 years or something

5690.32 --> 5693.599999999999
huh

5691.36 --> 5694.639
i thought i thought it would be similar

5693.6 --> 5696.719
lg

5902.4 --> 5905.5199999999995

5980.88 --> 5984.4800000000005
what's the meaning of life god

5987.6 --> 5993.1990000000005
well what's the purpose of your design

5990.8 --> 5995.84
what's the purpose of the design

5993.199 --> 5995.839999999999
right

6004.88 --> 6009.4400000000005
so you could say the meaning of life is

6007.36 --> 6011.119
purpose

6009.44 --> 6014.32
really

6011.119 --> 6019.4
doesn't really clarify a lot

6014.32 --> 6019.4
but it is considerably true

6028.88 --> 6033.28
right

6030.159 --> 6035.44
anyway thanks everyone for coming

6033.28 --> 6036.4

6035.44 --> 6039.599999999999
was very

6036.4 --> 6039.599999999999
good this time

6040.08 --> 6046.639

6043.6 --> 6048.2390000000005

6046.639 --> 6053.159000000001
hey

6048.239 --> 6053.159
tara 306 popping in last minute

whoa

6069.36 --> 6072.239
okay terret

6072.8 --> 6078.719
that's a very materialistic way of

6075.119 --> 6081.28
viewing that but i guess

6078.719 --> 6082.88
yeah maybe that's a that falls in line

6081.28 --> 6084.159
with purpose

6082.88 --> 6086.56
a little

6084.159 --> 6088.799999999999
from materialistic standpoint

6086.56 --> 6088.8

6106.639 --> 6111.76
like at all

6108.239 --> 6114.239
like it doesn't hold any weight at all

6111.76 --> 6115.280000000001
