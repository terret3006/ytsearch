148.42 --> 154.16
don't know how long it's gonna last

151.84 --> 156.709
there's there's not a lot of wind so

154.16 --> 168.29
it's not really a storm it just keeps on

156.709 --> 170.989
raining all right so I got Tamara coffee

168.29 --> 173.959
just made it that's also a reason why I

170.989 --> 174.47
was a little bit late just thinking oh

173.959 --> 176.87
wait

174.47 --> 180.049
Sunday episode the ID with this cool

176.87 --> 189.26
especially I wanted to another Tamara

coffee mmm so yeah I'm gonna have a good

189.26 --> 196.16
serving on the show so later once I'm

192.489 --> 200.209
basically cleared up here and went

196.16 --> 204.2
through all the routines so let's go go

200.209 --> 209.26
through chat hm was first Missouri Bear

204.2 --> 209.26
Amanda young Robin Stanley

213.42 --> 226.14
they like oh hi oh good servant Missouri

218.409 --> 228.60999999999999
bear decided to Cosentino alone EO

226.14 --> 237.909
conspiracy cats welcome back Rhett

228.61 --> 248.95000000000002
Priestley getting sick yeah good to see

237.909 --> 253.87
you all still monkey 3d yeah yesterday

248.95 --> 255.25
was a was an interesting show I don't

253.87 --> 256.949
think uh spirit kasseri they had

255.25 --> 259.75
anything to complain about

256.949 --> 263.38
it's weird by the way that he has a

259.75 --> 265.09
wrench over at Roxanne's channel I don't

263.38 --> 272.1
know why she gave him a wrench maybe

265.09 --> 272.09999999999997
because he's just very mild tempered

276.27 --> 283.289
anyway yeah I've been hanging around

279.75 --> 287.61
Roxanne's yesterday and I'm Benjamin of

283.289 --> 289.53
course the two-streams although I went

287.61 --> 291.509
to bed like in during a second because

289.53 --> 303.55999999999995
that's like just way too late for me

291.509 --> 303.56
anyway alright what else did I do

324.72 --> 330.29
because you're lucky oh yeah your your

327.24 --> 330.29
lovely alright

333.68 --> 337.18
[Music]

342.68 --> 348.05
yeah the conspiracy cats us even been on

345.08 --> 355.33
the show here it's where he basically

348.05 --> 358.18
admitted that yeah you you do require a

355.33 --> 361.13
container in order to have gas pressure

358.18 --> 363.32
that's where that wasn't my show pretty

361.13 --> 374.479
proud of that and he should be too

363.32 --> 381.94
because it's true right yes you did I

374.479 --> 381.94
got hit on my show Oh God

389.94 --> 395.67
while Missouri bear know that if they

393.3 --> 398.09000000000003
remove presuppositions and assumptions

395.67 --> 401.22
then there is nothing left to work

398.09 --> 405.59999999999997
that's what they do that's the whole

401.22 --> 408.48
ball system if you remove all that then

405.6 --> 411.14000000000004
there's not really anything left that's

408.48 --> 411.14000000000004
the whole point

417.83 --> 423.68
now what instead would be a better

420.78 --> 428.7
solution is if it could simply be

423.68 --> 431.13
cleared up that the ballers should be

428.7 --> 434.72999999999996
honest every single time about their

431.13 --> 436.83
presuppositions because in a way yeah it

434.73 --> 438.63
still remains leaves that remote chance

436.83 --> 440.52
that's the thing about a presupposition

438.63 --> 441.87
even though yeah it can be dispelled

440.52 --> 444.39
with a few ignore it but if you just

441.87 --> 451.71
honest that technically you are

444.39 --> 456.57
presupposing these things then then

451.71 --> 459.419
there would be less of a problem for ya

456.57 --> 461.78
with communications because it would be

459.419 --> 461.78
honest

465.249 --> 473.589
you know I do that I I work a lot with

469.139 --> 477.699
presuppositions when I feel like it but

473.589 --> 483.729
I'm very clear about it very open and

477.699 --> 485.499
honest and not gonna be fooled that that

483.729 --> 489.99899999999997
thing is real

485.499 --> 492.249
I just just because it fits in a

489.999 --> 498.639
framework that exists doesn't make it

492.249 --> 502.589
real because in order for something to

498.639 --> 506.379
be real it has to refer back to

502.589 --> 508.419
foundations that are proven and when you

506.379 --> 510.909
presuppose things and you can't actually

508.419 --> 514.8389999999999
prove those presuppositions then yeah

510.909 --> 518.889
it's just a framework it's virtual and

514.839 --> 522.3090000000001
it may abide by certain systematic by

518.889 --> 524.889
systematic nature certain principles it

522.309 --> 527.68
keeps on building on but it does not

524.889 --> 530.519
necessarily make that real just because

527.68 --> 534.12
it has a system and it may be even vast

530.519 --> 534.12
that's the whole point

541.78 --> 544.85
[Music]

547.0 --> 550.12
[Music]

554.49 --> 560.529
uncle Speer see cats maybe you should

556.899 --> 564.87
check out got servants channel you know

560.529 --> 568.12
he started up this thing with Tom Parker

564.87 --> 571.24
it's going pretty well at least there's

568.12 --> 574.329
a lot of animal there's a lot of energy

571.24 --> 576.55
there to keep on going and you got you

574.329 --> 582.8389999999999
guys got something going but they

576.55 --> 585.899
started regularly or relatively recent

582.839 --> 588.6990000000001
you know I've been around for years

585.899 --> 590.889
you've been around for years conspiracy

588.699 --> 593.819
cats but good servants only been around

590.889 --> 604.3290000000001
pretty much for months

593.819 --> 613.5
can't talk politely well he can but good

604.329 --> 613.5
servants just very allergic to yeah

614.8 --> 619.93
- people - lying and that includes

617.92 --> 623.86
people lying to themselves there's this

619.93 --> 624.6999999999999
thing that comes off that and it feels

623.86 --> 626.25
like poison

624.7 --> 631.38
- good servant I think I think that's

626.25 --> 634.92
one of the bigger problems he has step

631.38 --> 639.399
because that's what I'm it and yeah that

634.92 --> 643.54
effect that vulnerability and not being

639.399 --> 645.579
able to deal with that like without

643.54 --> 648.459
building up pressure more and more and

645.579 --> 652.899
more it can typically lead to like cell

648.459 --> 656.1099999999999
vanya syndrome type type symptoms and

652.899 --> 659.529
yeah I'm not blaming anyone that would

656.11 --> 662.74
go undergo that yeah I in my own way

659.529 --> 666.51
have that and yeah I damn well does lead

662.74 --> 668.92
to that so it's not like you can blame

666.51 --> 671.55
somebody unless they just keep on

668.92 --> 675.61
doubling down on purpose somehow they

671.55 --> 679.75
turn their world inside out to try and

675.61 --> 681.76
justify the paranoia all that the

679.75 --> 684.1
behavior into some kind of paranoid

681.76 --> 687.43
context that's not really real that's

684.1 --> 690.61
typical for Sivan yet for real selves on

687.43 --> 694.2399999999999
use and it's a risk it's a psychological

690.61 --> 696.79
trap and it comes from an overreaction

694.24 --> 699.61
because of sensitivity that for some

696.79 --> 703.149
reason you can't properly protect or

699.61 --> 706.35
adaptive right and good sir yeah I know

703.149 --> 706.35
you're never vindictive

711.68 --> 727.2199999999999
what proper Christian this conspiracy

718.22 --> 734.4200000000001
cats look a person no sorry that coming

727.22 --> 736.4300000000001
from you is yeah talk about a pot

734.42 --> 742.43
calling the kettle black situation

736.43 --> 745.64
Antoine and besides a proper Christian

742.43 --> 749.2399999999999
is not a model of behavior okay

745.64 --> 754.43
it is not a model of it it is a set of

749.24 --> 757.25
principles and a guiding system to

754.43 --> 761.2399999999999
understand the consequences of choices

757.25 --> 765.47
and actions and principles that's it's a

761.24 --> 769.82
guide it's not just like a a picturesque

765.47 --> 773.779
type exemplary situation that you should

769.82 --> 776.2600000000001
be emulating that's not a proper

773.779 --> 776.26
Christian

789.88 --> 797.48
right a relationship with the creator

792.77 --> 799.79
you could call it that or you could just

797.48 --> 802.01
call it a relationship with the the

799.79 --> 804.5
essence with the energies of the world

802.01 --> 807.35
which in my opinion in a way is the

804.5 --> 815.99
Creator the Alpha know mag in my view

807.35 --> 818.0
everything is the creator and part yeah

815.99 --> 822.32
what I consider Christ is like if you

818.0 --> 824.62
follow the right methodologies you

822.32 --> 827.57
understand the consequences then you can

824.62 --> 832.21
stay pure and then not get dragged down

827.57 --> 835.97
ascend get more oversight get more grip

832.21 --> 837.9200000000001
with the responsibility and face new

835.97 --> 840.85
challenges on that level and then you

837.92 --> 844.79
keep on going and going and going and

840.85 --> 847.6700000000001
whatever you do with your spirit and

844.79 --> 850.61
your personal life will eventually then

847.67 --> 854.3
start to echo back to you from the

850.61 --> 858.11
outside world that's purely from an

854.3 --> 861.5
egocentric or perspective because when I

858.11 --> 866.9300000000001
spirit gaze when I look like that that's

861.5 --> 870.02
really from a from a me perspective I

866.93 --> 873.38
can't involve that kind of I can't

870.02 --> 877.13
involve like individuals with their

873.38 --> 882.1899999999999
complete being and what they do in that

877.13 --> 882.1899999999999
process it has to be a solitary process

884.44 --> 900.5200000000001
anyway yeah

888.19 --> 900.5200000000001
good servant you want to come on right

903.85 --> 913.149
knows when you get into deep holy spirit

906.94 --> 916.0
guides the spirit guides it's the the

913.149 --> 917.889
thing is about God and about the energy

916.0 --> 920.259
of God and it's something that Owen

917.889 --> 922.0600000000001
Benjamin I can see and feel that he's

920.259 --> 925.899
like experimenting with this and it's

922.06 --> 929.8599999999999
good he's very sharp so he couldn't do

925.899 --> 937.899
it is that you if you land yourself in

929.86 --> 943.3000000000001
very risky places but guided by logos

937.899 --> 946.87
not daring in just filthy territory to

943.3 --> 951.67
get something earthly but like just

946.87 --> 954.94
risking more for good and and Trust and

951.67 --> 958.269
all that that that yeah that that for

954.94 --> 962.0500000000001
some reason when you're not doing it yet

958.269 --> 963.759
but you're gonna do it you could start

962.05 --> 965.56
thinking out like wait but that's all

963.759 --> 968.0500000000001
that risk and what if this happened one

965.56 --> 970.75
if that happens but when you actually do

968.05 --> 973.24
it it's like things change if you do it

970.75 --> 975.43
the right way and then literally God

973.24 --> 980.74
provides in the sense that suddenly your

975.43 --> 983.4699999999999
energy will be shifted or will be

980.74 --> 985.089
enhanced from like the outside it

983.47 --> 990.13
doesn't even have something to do with

985.089 --> 992.889
you and you get ideas or a mindset on a

990.13 --> 994.8389999999999
new level to accompany for it and then

992.889 --> 998.7090000000001
all the original dangers that were

994.839 --> 1002.009
perceived from going there evaporate and

998.709 --> 1008.25
that happens a lot of the times so

1002.009 --> 1010.41
reality when you're actually shifting

1008.25 --> 1016.47
your frequency you know that or when you

1010.41 --> 1020.79
condense it won't seem like what it

1016.47 --> 1023.49
actually becomes is sometimes just not

1020.79 --> 1025.77
what you think it would become from the

1023.49 --> 1027.539
perspective of when you're not there yet

1025.77 --> 1030.839
and that's part of the trick it's it's

1027.539 --> 1036.87
even like part of the surrender to God

1030.839 --> 1040.1789999999999
at it like yeah it you got a trust

1036.87 --> 1045.339
because you can't really see it when you

1040.179 --> 1047.38
haven't done it yet and I know this for

1045.339 --> 1049.8999999999999
a fact even though I haven't experienced

1047.38 --> 1052.5900000000001
that yet just from reflecting that it

1049.9 --> 1058.99
happens like that with getting kids

1052.59 --> 1062.9199999999998
almost with everybody it's like you

1058.99 --> 1064.15
can't imagine even handling it like you

1062.92 --> 1066.04
don't know who you're gonna face what

1064.15 --> 1068.14
they're gonna do but when the kid

1066.04 --> 1070.3
arrived when that magic happens and it's

1068.14 --> 1073.7800000000002
real magic okay the energies that happen

1070.3 --> 1075.82
it's unbelievable and you transform in

1073.78 --> 1079.6
certain ways but usually not in a way

1075.82 --> 1082.0
expected things are added on from the

1079.6 --> 1084.58
outside that this is pure reflection

1082.0 --> 1089.74
this is pure gazing that I'm because I

1084.58 --> 1092.11
haven't been a father and then yeah this

1089.74 --> 1097.11
person really met starts manifesting in

1092.11 --> 1099.309
a child the individual and they

1097.11 --> 1101.08
subconsciously all that there's like

1099.309 --> 1102.82
this relation that that cannot be

1101.08 --> 1107.05
described that's like in the other

1102.82 --> 1110.61
dimension and they lean on you and very

1107.05 --> 1115.3899999999999
serious like they take you more serious

1110.61 --> 1118.03
than you do yourself usually and when

1115.39 --> 1122.44
you feel that you realize that you have

1118.03 --> 1124.1789999999999
to take that seriousness serious because

1122.44 --> 1127.15
if you don't if you shame that

1124.179 --> 1131.0800000000002
seriousness that the kid will feel and

1127.15 --> 1135.2800000000002
see in you then they will copy the

1131.08 --> 1137.8
distortion on that level it will be a

1135.28 --> 1139.809
psychological trauma that'll drag them

1137.8 --> 1143.9199999999998
down over their lifetime and you can

1139.809 --> 1148.0
feel that really at first it's the young

1143.92 --> 1150.5500000000002
child experience is can be a huge trial

1148.0 --> 1154.26
like a personal ego trial and you have

1150.55 --> 1157.96
to crush it harder than ever you have to

1154.26 --> 1160.6
like you have to make it perfect like no

1157.96 --> 1163.8700000000001
more like even if it feels like you're

1160.6 --> 1167.09
risking like death

1163.87 --> 1169.309
can be like that anyway yeah this is

1167.09 --> 1170.99
super presuppositional because I haven't

1169.309 --> 1178.12
personally experienced but I have seen a

1170.99 --> 1182.39
lot I've been very interested all right

1178.12 --> 1184.2199999999998
anyway let me call you good servant good

1182.39 --> 1200.8300000000002
servant knows what it is to be dad he

1184.22 --> 1205.22
has a kid how you doing buddy

1200.83 --> 1209.1399999999999
hello am I on the air yes you are

1205.22 --> 1211.3600000000001
hold on let me alright so I don't sound

1209.14 --> 1214.9
disturbing baby

1211.36 --> 1218.24
hello yeah

1214.9 --> 1222.5900000000001
come here yeah yeah I need to put up my

1218.24 --> 1224.95
own volume alright yeah yeah it seems

1222.59 --> 1229.07
like sound is coming through fine

1224.95 --> 1231.679
alright alright in the servant yeah how

1229.07 --> 1234.83
are you doing man I'm doing good man

1231.679 --> 1238.3400000000001
just good to be on you know I was just

1234.83 --> 1243.08
thinking about conspiracy cats the other

1238.34 --> 1246.26
day and he's in the way I know we had a

1243.08 --> 1249.5
little back and forth just as we started

1246.26 --> 1251.929
off but just remembering yesterday you

1249.5 --> 1253.4
know how you know Paige was trying to

1251.929 --> 1255.3200000000002
tell him that he was wrong about the

1253.4 --> 1258.2900000000002
viruses and then you know you kind of

1255.32 --> 1260.96
backed her up you know and then you know

1258.29 --> 1263.36
he started ridiculing her about he has a

1260.96 --> 1265.309
degree in all this you know and it's

1263.36 --> 1265.8799999999999
like you know you come here to you know

1265.309 --> 1269.9289999999999
for help

1265.88 --> 1272.63
why don't you just pay attention and you

1269.929 --> 1273.8300000000002
know get along and learn and you know

1272.63 --> 1280.3400000000001
that's what I'm doing I don't know

1273.83 --> 1282.26
everything right you know but so yeah

1280.34 --> 1284.6299999999999
it's just I'm glad that you checked on

1282.26 --> 1285.26
me yesterday I really thank you for

1284.63 --> 1288.5900000000001
doing that

1285.26 --> 1293.0
I wasn't feeling good like all yesterday

1288.59 --> 1295.28
was real bad and and I was like I didn't

1293.0 --> 1296.45
know that was really that bad but I did

1295.28 --> 1298.7
follow it like you

1296.45 --> 1303.29
you just seemed like a little bit more

1298.7 --> 1306.2
unnerved know that ya know I'm glad it's

1303.29 --> 1308.24
been like that for a while you know ever

1306.2 --> 1311.0
since me and Tom started doing our thing

1308.24 --> 1312.56
it's not related but like you know a lot

1311.0 --> 1316.87
of stress worrying about the kids and

1312.56 --> 1321.3799999999999
stuff but just recently my youngest son

1316.87 --> 1324.4099999999999
he got saved finally and it was his own

1321.38 --> 1327.8600000000001
decision and now both of my kids are

1324.41 --> 1329.99
saved and I yeah it's just I couldn't be

1327.86 --> 1333.53
prouder of my kids right now like like

1329.99 --> 1335.69
I've done you know I got a little you

1333.53 --> 1337.46
know I look I have I've had some

1335.69 --> 1341.75
failures in my life and I've had some

1337.46 --> 1344.0
some ups and downs you know but you know

1341.75 --> 1346.13
I got a little military career I'm proud

1344.0 --> 1349.16
of and my and both my kids are saved and

1346.13 --> 1354.5900000000001
I feel like once that happened just this

1349.16 --> 1356.78
this feeling of completeness just you

1354.59 --> 1360.6499999999999
know just kind of came over me and I

1356.78 --> 1362.78
really felt grateful you know really

1360.65 --> 1366.41
felt grateful especially for flat earth

1362.78 --> 1369.68
and that growing my faith and then

1366.41 --> 1371.99
meeting Tom and doing the show I I've

1369.68 --> 1374.54
gained more with with my kids in this

1371.99 --> 1377.48
last year then I have in in the last

1374.54 --> 1385.87
five years and it's just amazing you

1377.48 --> 1385.8700000000001
know so what have you been working on

1387.04 --> 1394.03
working on I guess my business it's

1391.13 --> 1399.3500000000001
weird to say it but yeah you know I'm

1394.03 --> 1401.47
I'm I'm the worst I'm so slow I'm like I

1399.35 --> 1405.26
feel like I'm completely incompetent

1401.47 --> 1407.69
because technically the way I do things

1405.26 --> 1410.57
I could do it like 10 times faster but

1407.69 --> 1412.7
for some reason it never really rolls

1410.57 --> 1415.04
out like that maybe because the absolute

1412.7 --> 1418.82
necessity isn't there yet because

1415.04 --> 1421.82
there's no point in a way that I that I

1418.82 --> 1426.53
can't explain like if I do things too

1421.82 --> 1428.6299999999999
fast - well then I'll be like so in the

1426.53 --> 1429.62
thrill of that that after that there's a

1428.63 --> 1434.3600000000001
vacuum because

1429.62 --> 1438.32
it's not yeah then what you know well I

1434.36 --> 1440.1499999999999
think I think well not think about it

1438.32 --> 1442.61
like this Arlen I think you need to give

1440.15 --> 1446.21
yourself some credit because if you were

1442.61 --> 1448.79
just a shady guy that cashed in on like

1446.21 --> 1451.3700000000001
marketing or whatever and just wanted to

1448.79 --> 1453.76
do it the quick way you could make money

1451.37 --> 1456.2299999999998
if you didn't care about other people

1453.76 --> 1457.91
you know what I mean but because you

1456.23 --> 1461.84
want to do things the right way and

1457.91 --> 1463.67
honestly you know that like it prolongs

1461.84 --> 1464.9289999999999
things because you know you have to have

1463.67 --> 1466.46
a certain amount of trust and other

1464.929 --> 1468.95
people they have a certain amount of

1466.46 --> 1471.47
trust in you but if you really wanted to

1468.95 --> 1474.14
be shady and didn't have any regard for

1471.47 --> 1476.63
other people at all you you you could

1474.14 --> 1478.5800000000002
already be where you want to be

1476.63 --> 1481.64
financially you know but that's a

1478.58 --> 1484.73
testament to necessarily though you

1481.64 --> 1492.679
don't think there's more to it than that

1484.73 --> 1495.53
it's the the problem is just that just

1492.679 --> 1497.6000000000001
doing things for the money it's just not

1495.53 --> 1499.76
always effective for what you want to

1497.6 --> 1502.79
accomplish you know like some of these

1499.76 --> 1505.4
people that just very clearly do things

1502.79 --> 1508.37
for money they do things they say things

1505.4 --> 1510.2
they deal with people they they just

1508.37 --> 1512.8999999999999
have a certain type of affect that

1510.2 --> 1515.0900000000001
they're that they have to deal with like

1512.9 --> 1518.9
I couldn't deal with that level of

1515.09 --> 1521.0
pressure on my conscious on everything

1518.9 --> 1525.5300000000002
like I couldn't survive that like even

1521.0 --> 1528.41
if I would go for it you know like it's

1525.53 --> 1532.16
too punishing it's too interesting to

1528.41 --> 1536.51
just to just yeah treat people like

1532.16 --> 1540.71
cattle effectively to get more stats and

1536.51 --> 1543.08
more money I just I couldn't do it right

1540.71 --> 1544.4
and that's and see that that is what I

1543.08 --> 1547.46
was taught that's what I'm talking about

1544.4 --> 1550.8500000000001
that says a lot about you in your

1547.46 --> 1553.3700000000001
character you know because like if you

1550.85 --> 1555.9499999999998
wanted to take shortcuts or put your

1553.37 --> 1558.4699999999998
face on a t-shirt and you know rage win

1555.95 --> 1561.3500000000001
t-shirts and all this and you know and

1558.47 --> 1562.39
just commercialize and cash in on the

1561.35 --> 1564.1599999999999
law or what

1562.39 --> 1566.5
yeah you can make a few bucks for a

1564.16 --> 1568.15
couple years or whatever but I mean if

1566.5 --> 1571.03
you really want to be taken seriously

1568.15 --> 1573.25
like like like longer in life you know

1571.03 --> 1576.6399999999999
what I mean my greatest dream is not

1573.25 --> 1580.6
getting a score of money and because

1576.64 --> 1582.73
yeah what after that you know where I

1580.6 --> 1585.4599999999998
have money your dreams but I feel

1582.73 --> 1587.8600000000001
they're extremely unlikely that I could

1585.46 --> 1591.07
make it because it's like very big and

1587.86 --> 1593.26
the world like I can't envision the

1591.07 --> 1596.77
world cooperating with any of it it's so

1593.26 --> 1598.78
Grabel everything it's you know that the

1596.77 --> 1602.53
only way that I could even conceive of

1598.78 --> 1605.6499999999999
getting there is doing the things that I

1602.53 --> 1608.56
do the way that I do and just very

1605.65 --> 1612.5500000000002
slowly step by step not losing momentum

1608.56 --> 1616.45
but yeah like a like an ebony tree Stern

1612.55 --> 1618.46
very stern but slow but just like as

1616.45 --> 1620.6200000000001
other things grow faster and like oh

1618.46 --> 1622.33
look at that big tree and then a storm

1620.62 --> 1624.57
comes and that big tree is gonna be

1622.33 --> 1627.31
ripped away I'm gonna still stand here

1624.57 --> 1631.0
because I'm very slow growing a very

1627.31 --> 1632.74
strong that's kind of sort of my life

1631.0 --> 1636.07
strategy that's what it's become

1632.74 --> 1639.97
and yeah following the path it's just

1636.07 --> 1645.03
it's perfect because it's become a

1639.97 --> 1649.5
challenge for me like I see see like

1645.03 --> 1653.41
growing wealth quickly is really like a

1649.5 --> 1656.56
curse to me in my view energy wise like

1653.41 --> 1659.8500000000001
good money to get some places you need

1656.56 --> 1662.8899999999999
money for stability but like big gains

1659.85 --> 1664.6299999999999
you know changes are fully outside it

1662.89 --> 1666.64
seems like oh and then you can do this

1664.63 --> 1668.6200000000001
and that and that but you don't

1666.64 --> 1671.0800000000002
understand that if you are that person

1668.62 --> 1673.6899999999998
there's other things also gonna happen

1671.08 --> 1676.12
to you energy wise and suddenly the way

1673.69 --> 1677.56
people see you and who's gonna approach

1676.12 --> 1681.54
you and what's gonna roll out of that

1677.56 --> 1684.8999999999999
you know you don't get to see that part

1681.54 --> 1688.6299999999999
you just gets right before the big score

1684.9 --> 1693.0400000000002
yeah that's what how people are educated

1688.63 --> 1695.469
through advertisement and I had a great

1693.04 --> 1697.789
I had a gravity question for you

1695.469 --> 1701.69
sorry are you ready for are you ready

1697.789 --> 1705.679
for a gravity question oh sure okay so

1701.69 --> 1708.559
okay so let's let's say that I can get

1705.679 --> 1711.049
like a mountain right like say the size

1708.559 --> 1714.379
of like mount Tahoe or whatever like a

1711.049 --> 1716.809
big mountain right and and hover it

1714.379 --> 1720.4089999999999
above the ground about a foot off the

1716.809 --> 1723.469
ground right and then I slide a pencil

1720.409 --> 1725.769
in between the mountain and the ground

1723.469 --> 1732.079
right the earth and a mountain right

1725.769 --> 1735.579
will that pencil react in any way to the

1732.079 --> 1735.579
mountain being on top of it

1736.179 --> 1741.049
wait what

1737.839 --> 1742.759
so does gravity just work independently

1741.049 --> 1747.309
just with the pencil in the earth

1742.759 --> 1749.959
without it like any without any

1747.309 --> 1752.749
consideration of what's around it at all

1749.959 --> 1754.999
like you okay so if I had like a really

1752.749 --> 1758.179
large magnet the size of a mountain and

1754.999 --> 1762.409
say the earth was metal and I threw like

1758.179 --> 1764.6290000000001
a piece of metal in between that little

1762.409 --> 1766.279
gap that little piece of metal would

1764.629 --> 1769.309
know really quick that there was a

1766.279 --> 1772.219
magnet on top of it you know well but

1769.309 --> 1775.369
depending on the range between a magnet

1772.219 --> 1777.799
because of an magnetic field has like a

1775.369 --> 1779.9589999999998
range you know it has a rate of

1777.799 --> 1782.509
influence even you can visually

1779.959 --> 1785.509
represent that through system through

1782.509 --> 1787.82
things and models there's a range and it

1785.509 --> 1790.759
like increases its strength the closer

1787.82 --> 1798.559
it gets to the actual magnet and like

1790.759 --> 1801.109
depending on the total weight right so

1798.559 --> 1805.6689999999999
morality is not like that at all it's

1801.109 --> 1808.4289999999999
why I started dispelling this early idea

1805.669 --> 1809.509
that gravity is supposedly electrical in

1808.429 --> 1812.659
some kind of way you know

1809.509 --> 1815.709
no gravity is not like that Oh gravity

1812.659 --> 1820.3390000000002
is basically relative density in effect

1815.709 --> 1823.029
right and it is come it is a constant it

1820.339 --> 1826.369
is a constant and it is everywhere and

1823.029 --> 1828.48
it doesn't leave it doesn't have a range

1826.369 --> 1830.58
you know it it's suppose

1828.48 --> 1831.8700000000001
like big G's supposed to have a range

1830.58 --> 1834.1499999999999
you know the further away from Earth

1831.87 --> 1837.9289999999999
elastic gravity right well there is no

1834.15 --> 1841.3700000000001
proof that there even is a range after

1837.929 --> 1844.919
week after week this disequilibrium

1841.37 --> 1846.87
through relative density ceases there's

1844.919 --> 1848.76
speculation about it but there's no

1846.87 --> 1851.1899999999998
proof for that that actually even

1848.76 --> 1854.33
happens the distance by distance too

1851.19 --> 1856.74
deep so it's a big mass of the earth so

1854.33 --> 1858.72
yeah it depends if you're gonna have a

1856.74 --> 1861.75
metal object between a magnet and the

1858.72 --> 1864.27
earth it all depends on the Magnetic

1861.75 --> 1865.679
range if it can catch it if not it's

1864.27 --> 1868.59
going to be subjected to relative

1865.679 --> 1872.25
density and fall down well so now here's

1868.59 --> 1874.9499999999998
the thing right what would it do to the

1872.25 --> 1879.35
bending of space-time to have something

1874.95 --> 1882.179
the size of a mountain right on top of a

1879.35 --> 1886.53
hovering uh like a foot above the earth

1882.179 --> 1887.88
with a pencil in between wouldn't would

1886.53 --> 1891.809
there be an equation that would be able

1887.88 --> 1894.8700000000001
to hold that like like like so you're

1891.809 --> 1896.61
just gonna factor in the pencil with all

1894.87 --> 1898.9799999999998
the all the variables right the mountain

1896.61 --> 1901.1399999999999
the earth everything that mountain

1898.98 --> 1904.89
hasn't would have no effect on that

1901.14 --> 1907.74
pencil at all sorry I got distracted for

1904.89 --> 1910.23
a second say again so even though okay

1907.74 --> 1912.929
so that mountain would be like basically

1910.23 --> 1915.03
curving space-time right because that

1912.929 --> 1916.679
the mountain would would fall if you

1915.03 --> 1918.69
didn't suspend it right it has its own

1916.679 --> 1920.94
space time that it's curving right no

1918.69 --> 1924.3600000000001
you don't even know how that works

1920.94 --> 1927.51
nobody right yeah but why are you doing

1924.36 --> 1929.28
that why why are you trying to break the

1927.51 --> 1934.76
presupposition when it's already very

1929.28 --> 1937.1
supposition we know it's a positional

1934.76 --> 1941.25
explained throughout the density

1937.1 --> 1943.62
well-well tea mug was was was the mind

1941.25 --> 1945.9
of God he was telling me that and I was

1943.62 --> 1948.26
rolling on the floor man cuz I never

1945.9 --> 1951.7800000000002
thought about it that way you know like

1948.26 --> 1954.66
it ought like the gravity between the

1951.78 --> 1956.309
pencil and the earth is only between the

1954.66 --> 1961.0800000000002
pencil and the earth and it doesn't

1956.309 --> 1962.4289999999999
matter what's around it at all like that

1961.08 --> 1964.259
pencil will still drop it

1962.429 --> 1965.94
the same rate and everything in between

1964.259 --> 1968.129
that mouth sir

1965.94 --> 1970.74
yes because of the supposed mass

1968.129 --> 1971.49
attracting to mass or curvatures of

1970.74 --> 1975.539
space-time

1971.49 --> 1979.47
it's all right about the center point of

1975.539 --> 1981.899
the right of the glottal masses it's

1979.47 --> 1984.179
like you take all the masses and then

1981.899 --> 1987.6589999999999
you cross-reference it and then there is

1984.179 --> 1989.8200000000002
a center point from which the spacetime

1987.659 --> 1992.0700000000002
bending will originate so it's never

1989.82 --> 1994.259
going to be bending a little bit to the

1992.07 --> 1998.309
side so it's always going to be bending

1994.259 --> 2003.009
towards the the yeah the virtual middle

1998.309 --> 2006.769
point right so with that would that

2003.009 --> 2009.19
disprove gravity if you are able to do

2006.769 --> 2012.799
that experiment something like that no

2009.19 --> 2017.299
nothing been disproved gravity because

2012.799 --> 2021.95
there is no proof for gravity true it's

2017.299 --> 2024.259
virtual why would you try to just well

2021.95 --> 2025.82
in my mind I can picture that it's not

2024.259 --> 2028.249
real right it's easy for me to

2025.82 --> 2030.95
understand it's not real it's it's not

2028.249 --> 2033.499
doing anything right but to explain that

2030.95 --> 2035.659
to somebody that's like extremely

2033.499 --> 2037.82
brainwashed in this gravity is real

2035.659 --> 2039.1390000000001
especially if they're like they've been

2037.82 --> 2041.24
to school and they've done all these

2039.139 --> 2043.9399999999998
equations and they're like invested into

2041.24 --> 2046.94
this gravity right it's hard to get them

2043.94 --> 2047.69
to understand the gravity it doesn't do

2046.94 --> 2050.329
anything

2047.69 --> 2053.059
like they can't even picture it you know

2050.329 --> 2057.139
that it's even possible what I'm saying

2053.059 --> 2060.4700000000003
again yeah no problem with that it still

2057.139 --> 2063.619
doesn't make it real though you know to

2060.47 --> 2066.919
let it sink into people that gravity is

2063.619 --> 2069.1690000000003
is an aberration and not real you have

2066.919 --> 2072.589
to lay out the foundation where it's

2069.169 --> 2076.25
coming from how little G was originally

2072.589 --> 2080.0589999999997
kind of like a supposed law evening out

2076.25 --> 2083.27
system for Newtonian mechanics that's

2080.059 --> 2086.389
basically a presupposed force this

2083.27 --> 2088.639
equilibrium field present at all spaces

2086.389 --> 2089.9190000000003
and it doesn't account for space it's

2088.639 --> 2092.569
not involved in that

2089.919 --> 2094.47
anything about that it's very much

2092.569 --> 2096.0
adaptable to a flatter

2094.47 --> 2098.6699999999996
the realm however that's supposed to be

2096.0 --> 2102.72
laid out right it is adaptable to that

2098.67 --> 2105.77
little G but little G is an effect it's

2102.72 --> 2110.0989999999997
not very force it's an effect that is

2105.77 --> 2111.75
effectively caused by density through

2110.099 --> 2114.51
relative density disequilibrium

2111.75 --> 2117.66
the directions the alignments of which

2114.51 --> 2121.05
things seem to go by the proven relative

2117.66 --> 2122.8489999999997
density Theory shows that there is this

2121.05 --> 2124.349
alignment it doesn't give a reason for

2122.849 --> 2127.02
the line it just says this is how that

2124.349 --> 2130.55
is and that alignment could be

2127.02 --> 2134.79
calculated transformed into a model and

2130.55 --> 2138.09
said to be a force disequilibrium field

2134.79 --> 2141.0299999999997
and when you presuppose that the me it

2138.09 --> 2144.3
would explain the mechanics of relative

2141.03 --> 2146.6400000000003
density that's the effect but it's not a

2144.3 --> 2151.77
thing it's not actually a thing it's a

2146.64 --> 2156.0899999999997
virtual representation to help model DFO

2151.77 --> 2159.72
entity well it would it would be helpful

2156.09 --> 2163.02
to show like if something is further out

2159.72 --> 2168.8689999999997
of disequilibrium right the faster it

2163.02 --> 2171.119
will go right she should be right like

2168.869 --> 2173.94
the font the farther something is out of

2171.119 --> 2175.29
disequilibrium right I mean I'm sorry

2173.94 --> 2178.7400000000002
the farther something is out of

2175.29 --> 2182.25
equilibrium right the quicker it wants

2178.74 --> 2187.14
to get back to equilibrium again right

2182.25 --> 2189.51
there's no way to do that no no no no

2187.14 --> 2192.5989999999997
didn't just if it is out of equilibrium

2189.51 --> 2195.119
it is depending on the medium then it'll

2192.599 --> 2197.339
move but it will not necessarily move

2195.119 --> 2199.5
faster that because the forces will

2197.339 --> 2201.99
always roughly be well it will always be

2199.5 --> 2204.51
the same relative density disequilibrium

2201.99 --> 2206.609
force is always the same amount it's

2204.51 --> 2210.0890000000004
just that the medium it's going through

2206.609 --> 2214.5299999999997
depending on how dense it is in relation

2210.089 --> 2216.9
to the object will then offer more

2214.53 --> 2220.7400000000002
resistance for that motion through the

2216.9 --> 2223.83
medium making it go slower but it

2220.74 --> 2226.5299999999997
doesn't see so the force that is being

2223.83 --> 2228.36
subjected by relative density this

2226.53 --> 2231.0
equilibrium is always

2228.36 --> 2234.21
the same that's the funny thing it's

2231.0 --> 2238.28
just there's more substance to resist

2234.21 --> 2242.39
that motion that comes from it and

2238.28 --> 2245.4300000000003
that's also why things wave the same

2242.39 --> 2247.3799999999997
effectively and yeah when they can't

2245.43 --> 2250.1099999999997
maneuver anymore they'll subject

2247.38 --> 2253.04
pressure instead and that pressure is

2250.11 --> 2257.25
also constant it's not dependent on how

2253.04 --> 2259.47
thin the medium is around it so this is

2257.25 --> 2261.57
my question right and I hear this all

2259.47 --> 2263.1
the time right on the debates and stuff

2261.57 --> 2267.6600000000003
right where people will be talking about

2263.1 --> 2272.37
the the gradient or or or that or that

2267.66 --> 2275.43
somehow gravity holds the air to the

2272.37 --> 2277.77
earth right well if you go anywhere in

2275.43 --> 2280.74
your house right I mean you can go to

2277.77 --> 2282.54
the ceiling right the very you could put

2280.74 --> 2284.2799999999997
your lips near the ceiling right and

2282.54 --> 2286.74
you're gonna breathe air right air is

2284.28 --> 2289.3500000000004
all the way to the ceiling like like

2286.74 --> 2292.1099999999997
gravity even though gravity exists in

2289.35 --> 2295.86
your house it doesn't it doesn't hold

2292.11 --> 2297.84
the air down right like why why would

2295.86 --> 2303.42
that be any different on a large scale

2297.84 --> 2305.25
like why would that be hard to for

2303.42 --> 2308.33
somebody to understand that gravity

2305.25 --> 2310.86
doesn't work on air like that on gas oh

2308.33 --> 2314.16
Cafferty is not really a thing it's a

2310.86 --> 2316.53
presupposed force equilibrium field a

2314.16 --> 2319.29
relative density disequilibrium is

2316.53 --> 2321.9900000000002
proven and what it does it effectively

2319.29 --> 2326.07
splits up the dense from the less dense

2321.99 --> 2332.5499999999997
so there is a two way direction thing

2326.07 --> 2333.9
going effectively see right I don't know

2332.55 --> 2335.82
why they think that that works on earth

2333.9 --> 2340.7400000000002
but it doesn't work in your house you

2335.82 --> 2345.4500000000003
know I don't understand that train of

2340.74 --> 2347.91
thought of that like sign or whatever I

2345.45 --> 2352.1699999999996
don't know I just know how relative

2347.91 --> 2356.0099999999998
density or how density works and it is

2352.17 --> 2359.01
the cause of the yeah of the whole thing

2356.01 --> 2361.38
with gravity in the ball and in outer

2359.01 --> 2362.01
space and how an airplane sticks to the

2361.38 --> 2365.07
earth well

2362.01 --> 2367.4
flying around right like like all these

2365.07 --> 2370.59
I mean though the ball is in bad shape

2367.4 --> 2373.32
it's a bad position to argue from like

2370.59 --> 2377.46
it's it's so dead at this point

2373.32 --> 2379.98
right how could anybody at any level of

2377.46 --> 2382.7400000000002
education of say like someone that's

2379.98 --> 2384.6
been around in a couple years watching

2382.74 --> 2386.49
all the debates and stuff how could

2384.6 --> 2393.0899999999997
anybody believe that we're on it

2386.49 --> 2398.7299999999996
spinning ball because also science

2393.09 --> 2403.1400000000003
fiction because of money because they

2398.73 --> 2406.02
can't overcome a realization that like

2403.14 --> 2408.96
almost like the main theme in the world

2406.02 --> 2413.19
is like fake the many reasons why people

2408.96 --> 2415.5
do that yeah I mean like the way me and

2413.19 --> 2417.39
Tom have it on our on our show now is

2415.5 --> 2420.36
that we just talked about Flat Earth

2417.39 --> 2422.52
just matter of fact I mean it just it

2420.36 --> 2425.1
it's not even something we even debate

2422.52 --> 2428.67
you know like it's not like someone has

2425.1 --> 2430.02
to come on the on our show to debate the

2428.67 --> 2431.91
ballers and we're like that you know

2430.02 --> 2434.97
that's not really a debatable thing like

2431.91 --> 2437.94
that's that's been over you know like

2434.97 --> 2441.45
it's it's just as true as I breathe air

2437.94 --> 2446.34
outside you know and like like we've

2441.45 --> 2448.5
like had that that atmosphere pardon the

2446.34 --> 2451.98
pun that we've had that kind of show

2448.5 --> 2454.17
atmosphere of you know just talking

2451.98 --> 2457.11
matter-of-fact about it to where we've

2454.17 --> 2460.53
had a lot of people that were there just

2457.11 --> 2462.03
for our you know talks about Christ in

2460.53 --> 2464.82
the Bible and everything that have

2462.03 --> 2468.0
actually just easily transformed into

2464.82 --> 2470.81
flat-earthers just it wasn't even

2468.0 --> 2473.67
contentious I think the debate sometimes

2470.81 --> 2476.07
even makes them want to think longer

2473.67 --> 2480.51
about it you know then it's it could be

2476.07 --> 2482.61
a ball or or whatever right well we

2480.51 --> 2486.09
don't exactly know what the earth is

2482.61 --> 2490.98
yeah conspiracy cats the flaws in a flat

2486.09 --> 2493.7400000000002
earth model the model yeah we don't know

2490.98 --> 2495.66
what the model is like you can relate

2493.74 --> 2498.3289999999997
all kinds of ways but we don't have

2495.66 --> 2501.049
all the facts what one fact we do have

2498.329 --> 2503.69
however and that is the geometrical

2501.049 --> 2506.569
orientation of the surface how things

2503.69 --> 2510.27
geometrically interconnect it's flat

2506.569 --> 2512.7599999999998
mostly flat now it's flat I'm not

2510.27 --> 2515.13
talking about the surface I'm talking

2512.76 --> 2518.369
about the geometrical interconnection of

2515.13 --> 2521.46
the entire surface yeah not right not to

2518.369 --> 2525.0
really have um on top of it well it's

2521.46 --> 2529.02
pretty almost exactly flat like have you

2525.0 --> 2531.539
seen Jay tollens um no it is flat it is

2529.02 --> 2532.94
exactly that there's no reason for it to

2531.539 --> 2537.2700000000004
be any other way

2532.94 --> 2541.7400000000002
right well Jay Tolan was shooting out of

2537.27 --> 2543.5389999999998
the airplane and he like student uh his

2541.74 --> 2547.0789999999997
infrared camera you know taking pictures

2543.539 --> 2548.76
and he was showing the image right he

2547.079 --> 2551.039
was lifting the image and everything and

2548.76 --> 2555.2700000000004
he's like look how flat that really is

2551.039 --> 2558.1800000000003
like I mean it is like flat you know

2555.27 --> 2560.25
what I mean like I don't know how you

2558.18 --> 2562.1699999999996
could describe it another way other than

2560.25 --> 2565.71
flat with some you know some terrain

2562.17 --> 2571.049
features or whatever but the earth is

2565.71 --> 2573.93
flat yeah you know and to like okay so

2571.049 --> 2576.5389999999998
maybe someone might have thought hey

2573.93 --> 2578.339
it's a ball because of how optics work

2576.539 --> 2580.3190000000004
and everything but what I don't

2578.339 --> 2582.9
understand is how anyone can think that

2580.319 --> 2587.0389999999998
it's a ball in space and an infinite

2582.9 --> 2589.71
size 10 to the negative 17 Tour vacuum

2587.039 --> 2592.5890000000004
with a little bit of air stuck to it and

2589.71 --> 2594.75
you know half made of water so it's like

2592.589 --> 2597.299
a water droplet with some crust on it

2594.75 --> 2599.789
with a little air flying through the

2597.299 --> 2605.67
planet through of that rocky infinite

2599.789 --> 2608.2200000000003
size I mean I owe and not that's not our

2605.67 --> 2611.609
remember remember like way before we

2608.22 --> 2614.4599999999996
before we knew any of this like maybe

2611.609 --> 2616.71
before you even knew God and I knew God

2614.46 --> 2620.88
and it's like okay yeah remember the

2616.71 --> 2623.369
delicate evolution-based nature system

2620.88 --> 2625.23
that could be destroyed any second you

2623.369 --> 2628.079
know because of a meteor impact or

2625.23 --> 2629.339
something and then realize on top of

2628.079 --> 2632.7000000000003
that the ridiculous

2629.339 --> 2635.21
of people earth with all that randomly

2632.7 --> 2641.729
sprouted forth life balance and all that

2635.21 --> 2645.869
at the same the I believe that is so

2641.729 --> 2648.39
absurd it is absurd it's like it's so

2645.869 --> 2651.299
absurdly there's like the lie had to be

2648.39 --> 2654.269
that crazy for anyone to believed it you

2651.299 --> 2658.2
know you know what I mean because like

2654.269 --> 2661.049
like to think now back on what I used to

2658.2 --> 2663.5989999999997
believe right because I was trying I was

2661.049 --> 2666.059
having trouble like how does God exist

2663.599 --> 2668.7290000000003
like how is that even possible like a

2666.059 --> 2671.4300000000003
guy a fairy in the in the sky like I

2668.729 --> 2673.319
couldn't even conceive of that right but

2671.43 --> 2675.8289999999997
then once Flat Earth came right and I

2673.319 --> 2678.5389999999998
seen everything for what it really is I

2675.829 --> 2681.3590000000004
can't come to any other conclusion than

2678.539 --> 2683.7290000000003
God created everything you know like

2681.359 --> 2686.249
like it's obvious to me now you know

2683.729 --> 2688.14
whereas I was on the other side of that

2686.249 --> 2691.6189999999997
worry I couldn't even picture it you

2688.14 --> 2695.91
know it's tremendous what a tremendous

2691.619 --> 2699.839
leap you know I could actually like I I

2695.91 --> 2705.739
got to do really I was into creationism

2699.839 --> 2709.68
even before I figured out flatter so no

2705.739 --> 2711.779
yeah I was kind of divided like I even

2709.68 --> 2718.469
at at some point had like this idea

2711.779 --> 2724.339
where where God basically like yeah God

2718.469 --> 2727.44
waited no God created like the aliens

2724.339 --> 2729.839
remember Oh audience that created us

2727.44 --> 2731.7290000000003
here on earth like that idea

2729.839 --> 2734.7
I was basically like yeah yeah God

2731.729 --> 2737.8689999999997
created evolution that's right right

2734.7 --> 2737.8689999999997
like standing in South Park

2740.69 --> 2746.579
yeah that's it's so crazy because like

2744.329 --> 2749.6400000000003
like I was a Christian before I was a

2746.579 --> 2751.469
flatterer right for like I believed it

2749.64 --> 2753.1189999999997
but in a sense to where like oh that's

2751.469 --> 2755.819
in another realm somewhere and when i

2753.119 --> 2759.2690000000002
dial won't worry about it you know but

2755.819 --> 2762.779
like now it's like like this is God's

2759.269 --> 2765.359
world we're living that story and

2762.779 --> 2767.999
I can't picture the two things being

2765.359 --> 2770.519
separate whereas before I thought that

2767.999 --> 2773.009
okay when I died then I see God and it's

2770.519 --> 2775.8289999999997
in a whole nother realm or something I

2773.009 --> 2778.38
didn't think he was right up on top of

2775.829 --> 2780.569
the blue sky you know like I'm up there

2778.38 --> 2783.119
I didn't know about that either you know

2780.569 --> 2785.489
right there's no proof of that but I

2783.119 --> 2787.259
mean that's more likely to believe then

2785.489 --> 2791.579
we're flying through space in a vacuum

2787.259 --> 2794.159
with a productivist you know and their

2791.579 --> 2798.2090000000003
life came out of a rock somehow you know

2794.159 --> 2800.219
it ranged somehow in space on a rock and

2798.209 --> 2802.229
then I don't even know how the original

2800.219 --> 2804.15
air got here then right like the first

2802.229 --> 2807.7189999999996
animal had to start breathing right and

2804.15 --> 2811.829
then so like the original atmosphere no

2807.719 --> 2815.64
no it was to breathe it out by the gases

2811.829 --> 2818.369
in the lava and all that [ __ ] and like

2815.64 --> 2821.009
the oceans settled it's like it was

2818.369 --> 2824.4590000000003
water vapor at first basically hanging

2821.009 --> 2828.39
over the earth in the fallout situation

2824.459 --> 2833.9089999999997
and then it like settles back so it was

2828.39 --> 2838.469
like a yeah I was very gaseous so it

2833.909 --> 2839.88
just settled that yeah four or five

2838.469 --> 2841.949
years ago you could have got me to

2839.88 --> 2844.4390000000003
believe all that what you're saying the

2841.949 --> 2846.179
the gaseous vapor and not you coulda got

2844.439 --> 2848.3999999999996
me to believe all that yeah like there

2846.179 --> 2851.429
was a lot of water vapor basically

2848.4 --> 2853.7690000000002
surrounding the earth apparently or it

2851.429 --> 2855.869
was hanging or right in the solar system

2853.769 --> 2861.5089999999996
and then it got all dragged to the earth

2855.869 --> 2865.199
some something like that side or what is

2861.509 --> 2867.059
it comets flew in and then like buckets

2865.199 --> 2869.2690000000002
of water add it onto the earth or

2867.059 --> 2872.429
something

2869.269 --> 2874.529
supposedly water hi sir that's right

2872.429 --> 2878.009
that's right the comet crashed and it

2874.529 --> 2880.829
made an ice age for some reason it's

2878.009 --> 2883.529
like a big giant something about Earth

2880.829 --> 2886.529
oh that's after the dinosaurs that's a

2883.529 --> 2888.479
meteor crashing and creating dust clouds

2886.529 --> 2892.109
covering the earth freezing everything

2888.479 --> 2895.2889999999998
oh okay that makes sense now that never

2892.109 --> 2896.67
made sense to be pleased that you're

2895.289 --> 2901.0800000000004
terrible

2896.67 --> 2903.4500000000003
I was the worst I mean I didn't even

2901.08 --> 2905.13
really like Star Trek or Star Wars I

2903.45 --> 2906.4199999999996
mean I watched all the Star Wars when I

2905.13 --> 2908.31
was a kid in the theater you know

2906.42 --> 2910.59
because it was what all the cool kids

2908.31 --> 2912.69
were watching you know and you know you

2910.59 --> 2915.27
had to go see it right eat see all that

2912.69 --> 2917.4
right but like I never was really into

2915.27 --> 2919.59
space or any of that it never really

2917.4 --> 2921.9300000000003
interests me at all I never even looked

2919.59 --> 2924.15
up at the sky or what stars were up

2921.93 --> 2926.04
there I didn't know we looked at the

2924.15 --> 2930.15
same face of the moon all the time I had

2926.04 --> 2931.29
no clue you know if I would have known

2930.15 --> 2933.2400000000002
that I would have been like hey that's

2931.29 --> 2936.69
that's odd you know why is the whole

2933.24 --> 2939.5099999999998
world see one side of the Moon like we

2936.69 --> 2942.63
all see the exact same side no matter

2939.51 --> 2945.5400000000004
where you are on earth that's a little

2942.63 --> 2948.69
odd yeah yeah it is

2945.54 --> 2951.66
in a way and also when I was a

2948.69 --> 2956.4900000000002
heliocentric I never liked watching the

2951.66 --> 2958.89
moon I guess because it was like off a

2956.49 --> 2963.06
little and I didn't want to confront

2958.89 --> 2967.0099999999998
myself with that because I am how you

2963.06 --> 2969.96
have like very finely attuned spacial

2967.01 --> 2972.69
sensories like I'm very good at seeing

2969.96 --> 2975.77
3d understanding what I'm seeing

2972.69 --> 2978.3
figuring it out and the moon is like off

2975.77 --> 2981.72
if there's something off about it and

2978.3 --> 2983.07
you can feel that intuitively if you if

2981.72 --> 2985.98
you're not aware of that

2983.07 --> 2988.38
you know like the moon I'd love to see

2985.98 --> 2991.26
I'd love to look at moons and whatever

2988.38 --> 2995.58
in sci-fi because it really did look

2991.26 --> 2997.8300000000004
like a sphere I like that more then

2995.58 --> 3000.08
watch yeah in the actual sky at our Moon

2997.83 --> 3001.73
because it just didn't look right he

3000.08 --> 3008.12
didn't look well in what we were

3001.73 --> 3010.67
proposing so I just is it this is after

3008.12 --> 3012.62
I started watching flattered hey is that

3010.67 --> 3015.76
when I started looking at the moon it

3012.62 --> 3018.08
doesn't have like okay like spatial

3015.76 --> 3021.4100000000003
consequences like when it gets further

3018.08 --> 3023.66
away or closer it doesn't it doesn't

3021.41 --> 3026.24
look like an object further away no sure

3023.66 --> 3028.58
right right that's what I'm saying it

3026.24 --> 3030.3199999999997
doesn't have spatial consequences you

3028.58 --> 3032.96
know like you would a like a

3030.32 --> 3035.81
there was a physical sphere up there it

3032.96 --> 3036.64
would get smaller and bigger right you

3035.81 --> 3041.44
know what I mean

3036.64 --> 3044.98
yeah and it's not it doesn't do that

3041.44 --> 3047.57
that's the crazy part of it you know I

3044.98 --> 3048.2
only see the moon in the same size all

3047.57 --> 3050.9900000000002
the time

3048.2 --> 3057.04
I mean unless there's I'm in some kind

3050.99 --> 3060.41
of atmospheric lensing or whatever no

3057.04 --> 3063.5
okay so we now there is no atmospheric

3060.41 --> 3066.8599999999997
lensing not really that that doesn't

3063.5 --> 3068.51
make sense because it's upward yeah true

3066.86 --> 3071.48
but what about when the sun's like hella

3068.51 --> 3073.0400000000004
big over the ocean though like that kind

3071.48 --> 3075.47
of looks like lensing to me a little bit

3073.04 --> 3078.2599999999998
well that's at the horizon so there's

3075.47 --> 3080.8999999999996
more air in between in order to

3078.26 --> 3083.4500000000003
potentially cause any sort of lensing

3080.9 --> 3087.62
effect to whatever you're pre supposed

3083.45 --> 3090.3999999999996
to be there beyond the ball earth that's

3087.62 --> 3092.9
why I come to you for knowledge and I

3090.4 --> 3095.6
sit in these chats and I'm like oh maybe

3092.9 --> 3098.06
I'll learn something you know get a

3095.6 --> 3101.5699999999997
little sharper right well I'm always

3098.06 --> 3103.37
like melty modeling at the same time I'm

3101.57 --> 3105.59
just collecting data and then with each

3103.37 --> 3107.33
data point lifts out like this is how

3105.59 --> 3109.4900000000002
that's supposed to be on that that's how

3107.33 --> 3115.31
that's supposed to be on that and this

3109.49 --> 3117.95
is like yeah just that that's what I

3115.31 --> 3121.63
typically do well you need to do another

3117.95 --> 3125.7999999999997
episode where you go through the the

3121.63 --> 3128.6
rectangular looping model again because

3125.8 --> 3130.8500000000004
yeah you didn't you go through it like

3128.6 --> 3133.5499999999997
like I would say like 100 episodes or

3130.85 --> 3135.0499999999997
200 episodes ago like where you just

3133.55 --> 3135.92
went through it a little bit like 15

3135.05 --> 3137.9
minutes or whatever

3135.92 --> 3140.48
did you just got I've been through look

3137.9 --> 3143.36
I've got entire episodes dedicated to

3140.48 --> 3146.42
that like in the flower stalks days so

3143.36 --> 3148.73
and those still stand all those things

3146.42 --> 3150.65
that I said yeah I haven't found

3148.73 --> 3155.5
anything that I thought like yeah that's

3150.65 --> 3159.26
that's been undone or something so I

3155.5 --> 3164.0
don't know yeah I was like what what is

3159.26 --> 3166.46
that about loops and there could

3164.0 --> 3170.56
spatial warping going on it's like yeah

3166.46 --> 3175.2200000000003
the realm could be like like weird

3170.56 --> 3177.11
irregular loops spatial is like yeah

3175.22 --> 3179.18
that direction is not really that

3177.11 --> 3182.21
direction in relation to that other

3179.18 --> 3184.46
position that kind of [ __ ] yeah I

3182.21 --> 3186.2
couldn't right right but see but she's

3184.46 --> 3188.21
like it's like okay you remember when

3186.2 --> 3191.12
like greater Sapien or one of those guys

3188.21 --> 3193.4
like he raised like 25 grand to go to

3191.12 --> 3195.77
Antarctica or something like that like

3193.4 --> 3198.4100000000003
you put out a GoFundMe and got 25 grand

3195.77 --> 3200.18
or whatever like like that's the kind of

3198.41 --> 3203.0899999999997
money you need to go check out to you we

3200.18 --> 3205.37
need to look at the equator in order to

3203.09 --> 3207.8900000000003
like you know like work more on that

3205.37 --> 3210.2799999999997
rectangular looping model type yeah it'd

3207.89 --> 3213.19
have to be an expedition out their

3210.28 --> 3216.86
orientation well there should be a good

3213.19 --> 3218.84
well-organized wide project but in a way

3216.86 --> 3223.55
the world would have to be ready for

3218.84 --> 3226.3700000000003
that because such huge operations are

3223.55 --> 3229.7200000000003
kind of easily sabotaged like if you get

3226.37 --> 3232.46
media against you it's just not gonna

3229.72 --> 3234.08
like what you're gonna say yeah we got

3232.46 --> 3235.55
all these guys and we proved it look

3234.08 --> 3238.69
here's the data and then just the

3235.55 --> 3243.65
world's gonna say no we don't trust you

3238.69 --> 3245.2400000000002
so then one see that's what I that's the

3243.65 --> 3248.03
one thing that bothers me about the

3245.24 --> 3250.5499999999997
world is it like I mean look we're all

3248.03 --> 3252.2000000000003
born on this earth right I mean if we

3250.55 --> 3253.82
didn't have like you know a small

3252.2 --> 3256.1299999999997
percentage of people that want to own

3253.82 --> 3259.6400000000003
everything you know we could really

3256.13 --> 3262.37
share everything and have like a pretty

3259.64 --> 3265.94
great life you know you know what I mean

3262.37 --> 3269.75
like just you know you know I don't know

3265.94 --> 3273.38
man I know that that's you know I think

3269.75 --> 3277.22
you being a dreamer or looking at and

3273.38 --> 3281.4500000000003
the nature of humanity it's crazy man

3277.22 --> 3283.3999999999996
but it's like it's like this is the

3281.45 --> 3285.7999999999997
thing that bothers me right is it you

3283.4 --> 3287.51
got everyone on these screens right that

3285.8 --> 3289.19
they run the world right they're the

3287.51 --> 3291.8900000000003
elite or whatever you want to call them

3289.19 --> 3294.7400000000002
right and and if we just turned off the

3291.89 --> 3297.12
TV man like they wouldn't they just go

3294.74 --> 3299.1299999999997
away no

3297.12 --> 3300.66
they gonna stop us you know no they

3299.13 --> 3302.96
don't they'd find a new place that's

3300.66 --> 3305.43
what they that's what grapplers do Oh

3302.96 --> 3306.69
gravely man if that's what they are

3305.43 --> 3309.06
that's what that is

3306.69 --> 3311.9700000000003
I think that you're a blur analogy is

3309.06 --> 3315.5299999999997
like an an independent collective type

3311.97 --> 3319.2599999999998
principled system that just corrupts and

3315.53 --> 3322.11
it works the problem is it works for

3319.26 --> 3324.7200000000003
what it's supposed to be doing and that

3322.11 --> 3326.42
just is that's what what's happening so

3324.72 --> 3329.3399999999997
as soon as TV is like absolutely

3326.42 --> 3331.41
abandoned like as soon as the eldest

3329.34 --> 3333.06
generation that's kind of stuck to the

3331.41 --> 3337.68
TV they just can't walk away no matter

3333.06 --> 3339.81
what because they when they're gone yeah

3337.68 --> 3344.6699999999996
TV might cease to be

3339.81 --> 3347.94
and then they already have the Internet

3344.67 --> 3350.25
is already vastly under way of being

3347.94 --> 3353.79
gravelled in so many ways look at all

3350.25 --> 3356.04
the filler it's worse than TV the filler

3353.79 --> 3359.55
know that the grabbers are inserted on

3356.04 --> 3361.2599999999998
the Internet is worse than the TV not

3359.55 --> 3363.09
only that but when you try to search for

3361.26 --> 3365.82
stuff it's all buried you know all the

3363.09 --> 3367.38
truthful stuff is buried you know and so

3365.82 --> 3369.8
like if you really want to learn

3367.38 --> 3372.69
something and get the right answer right

3369.8 --> 3375.7200000000003
yeah you have to dig you know and most

3372.69 --> 3377.88
people won't do that you know like like

3375.72 --> 3379.3799999999997
most people will date oh let's google it

3377.88 --> 3382.08
and that's the answer they don't even

3379.38 --> 3383.94
check it if it's right you know oh let's

3382.08 --> 3387.0499999999997
google it okay this is the true answer

3383.94 --> 3390.0
you know like that's gospel the Google

3387.05 --> 3391.4700000000003
result you know what I mean and so like

3390.0 --> 3393.48
when you look up things like Flat Earth

3391.47 --> 3395.3999999999996
or whatever you get all these jokes

3393.48 --> 3398.76
sites you know and all this controlled

3395.4 --> 3400.4700000000003
opposition and I mean if I typed in Flat

3398.76 --> 3404.2200000000003
Earth on Google how long would it take

3400.47 --> 3406.74
me before I found Arwen you know it

3404.22 --> 3409.08
depends if you're just gonna go by that

3406.74 --> 3411.12
first word and keep on scrolling it's

3409.08 --> 3414.5699999999997
gonna take forever but if you're gonna

3411.12 --> 3417.0
just look and go by your feeling like I

3414.57 --> 3418.8300000000004
don't want to find ridicule about

3417.0 --> 3420.54
fellate Flat Earth but I want to see if

3418.83 --> 3422.85
I can find somebody it actually has

3420.54 --> 3426.15
something interesting to say about it if

3422.85 --> 3428.94
you then click on that and then search

3426.15 --> 3430.5
again or search through their

3428.94 --> 3433.619
subscriptions

3430.5 --> 3435.63
eventually yeah you could find me but

3433.619 --> 3440.07
yeah the only way to find me is if you

3435.63 --> 3443.4900000000002
really want to the only way it's gonna

3440.07 --> 3445.46
be unfortunately I just wish there was a

3443.49 --> 3448.56
way that we could like spread this

3445.46 --> 3450.119
information out to like as many people

3448.56 --> 3453.7799999999997
as possible to let them make the choice

3450.119 --> 3455.4300000000003
you know okay and the main six says you

3453.78 --> 3458.3100000000004
just type are in Flat Earth

3455.43 --> 3462.27
I never tried that see what happened oh

3458.31 --> 3465.27
it work everybody send those super

3462.27 --> 3470.88
chests and how is that our win is a

3465.27 --> 3472.95
pretty unique name of Jesus it is okay

3470.88 --> 3474.17
the first thing I get to see is my face

3472.95 --> 3477.0299999999997
at least

3474.17 --> 3480.81
it's your explosion during Blood Moon or

3477.03 --> 3482.75
whenever oh okay planar walk right the

3480.81 --> 3487.29
ridicule video that's just great

3482.75 --> 3489.69
right oh yeah yeah that reminds me on

3487.29 --> 3492.75
conspiracy catch channel I'd a go on one

3489.69 --> 3494.79
of one of his videos he had a video

3492.75 --> 3496.98
about you and I commented on there I

3494.79 --> 3499.23
lied and said that didn't go on this

3496.98 --> 3501.119
thing but he did he had a video about

3499.23 --> 3502.589
you talking about how your show was

3501.119 --> 3504.1800000000003
interesting or whatever and he was

3502.589 --> 3507.69
making fun or something like that and I

3504.18 --> 3509.8799999999997
thought I just talking crap to him Wow

3507.69 --> 3512.91
well when I get that the search it's

3509.88 --> 3514.7400000000002
like only ridicule [ __ ] all of it you

3512.91 --> 3518.73
know that's what I'm saying that's how

3514.74 --> 3521.27
it is but you could just go to my

3518.73 --> 3525.15
channel though like there is sufficient

3521.27 --> 3529.349
if you don't find me there's my patreon

3525.15 --> 3534.21
there for some reason type in if you

3529.349 --> 3537.0
type in flat earth 200 proofs right you

3534.21 --> 3539.55
get all ridicule right but when you type

3537.0 --> 3541.68
in just 200 proofs it's like I think

3539.55 --> 3543.48
they might have even have got gotten

3541.68 --> 3545.2799999999997
through this but it used to be if you

3543.48 --> 3547.7400000000002
just type in 200 proofs without the

3545.28 --> 3550.4700000000003
flatter distinction Eric Eric - babe

3547.74 --> 3554.4599999999996
came up like number one sivanna himself

3550.47 --> 3558.2099999999996
of course but he his flat earthwork you

3554.46 --> 3559.7400000000002
gotta admit is phenomenal I mean you

3558.21 --> 3561.81
know I mean for what it was if you're

3559.74 --> 3564.18
like an entry level flat earther that's

3561.81 --> 3565.89
just learning you know like

3564.18 --> 3567.8689999999997
not those are some good him you know

3565.89 --> 3570.0299999999997
even Oh didi had some good stuff but

3567.869 --> 3572.04
once you get beyond that first level

3570.03 --> 3575.27
then you got to look for more in-depth

3572.04 --> 3578.609
stuff you know if you can handle it

3575.27 --> 3580.339
that's true that's true I kept going

3578.609 --> 3584.16
back and forth back and forth because

3580.339 --> 3586.7999999999997
like I kept I kept wanting a reason to

3584.16 --> 3588.24
still believe in the ball so like I

3586.8 --> 3590.28
would look up stuff like okay radio

3588.24 --> 3593.1299999999997
waves being sent to the moon and back I

3590.28 --> 3595.17
know people have done that or you know I

3593.13 --> 3598.23
yeah I would think of obscure things to

3595.17 --> 3600.54
do like that like oh let me learn I sit

3598.23 --> 3601.859
through particle physics classes you

3600.54 --> 3604.47
know to find out how the atmosphere

3601.859 --> 3606.27
works and everything and you know and

3604.47 --> 3608.069
then once you get more and more into it

3606.27 --> 3610.68
right once you've accepted that it's

3608.069 --> 3612.99
flat right that we've been lied to like

3610.68 --> 3616.2599999999998
almost everything you learn about the

3612.99 --> 3620.2799999999997
atmosphere in motion and physics it's

3616.26 --> 3622.5890000000004
it's all bs man you know and you're like

3620.28 --> 3626.25
wow people pay a lot of money man to go

3622.589 --> 3627.93
to school right and and get education or

3626.25 --> 3633.059
whatever and they they don't learn

3627.93 --> 3636.54
anything you know I don't know man it's

3633.059 --> 3641.63
crazy man I mean people been getting

3636.54 --> 3644.16
robbed basically you know I don't know I

3641.63 --> 3647.099
mean it depends on what your experience

3644.16 --> 3650.1299999999997
in college is I guess if you had fun or

3647.099 --> 3655.26
whatever college man I wouldn't even try

3650.13 --> 3657.75
that at this point no pointless no I you

3655.26 --> 3659.9100000000003
know I got a software degree that's like

3657.75 --> 3662.94
way out of date you know so I can't

3659.91 --> 3664.41
really do anything with it but I you

3662.94 --> 3667.44
know at least I could say I went but

3664.41 --> 3670.92
it's a waste I think that college is not

3667.44 --> 3673.079
a really effective way to like to

3670.92 --> 3676.92
develop I think it's much better to

3673.079 --> 3679.319
really try to figure out like what is it

3676.92 --> 3681.96
you're good at where do you feel you

3679.319 --> 3685.17
could go and then go with courses and

3681.96 --> 3688.619
especially before that just get to know

3685.17 --> 3691.02
a lot of people so you you can yeah you

3688.619 --> 3692.9700000000003
don't just have to randomly try things

3691.02 --> 3695.849
to figure out if it's good costing you a

3692.97 --> 3697.8599999999997
lot of money in time you gotta form

3695.849 --> 3699.81
yourself what's good then

3697.86 --> 3702.7200000000003
where you can go it's very important

3699.81 --> 3704.61
than networking part like let's say you

3702.72 --> 3707.04
want to be a scientist right or whatever

3704.61 --> 3708.57
our doctor right why can't you just like

3707.04 --> 3710.85
okay they find out if you have the

3708.57 --> 3712.1400000000003
aptitude to really know about that stuff

3710.85 --> 3713.73
they give you a little test to see if

3712.14 --> 3715.83
you really have the aptitude to do it

3713.73 --> 3717.48
and then you just hang around a doctor

3715.83 --> 3718.0499999999997
for five six years and learn what he's

3717.48 --> 3720.6
doing

3718.05 --> 3723.27
yeah but that doesn't that doesn't make

3720.6 --> 3725.06
you a doctor though no but that's what

3723.27 --> 3728.49
I'm saying why can't it be like that

3725.06 --> 3730.5
because that's not how it is because it

3728.49 --> 3732.4199999999996
is it's not about the knowledge it's

3730.5 --> 3735.32
about the conduct it's about the

3732.42 --> 3738.03
discipline it's about the responsibility

3735.32 --> 3740.52
within that system you're upholding

3738.03 --> 3742.4700000000003
that's what it's really about it's not

3740.52 --> 3744.27
just the knowledge you can have that

3742.47 --> 3747.6299999999997
knowledge and then you can use it for

3744.27 --> 3750.15
yourself but it won't work like that if

3747.63 --> 3752.82
you want to be a doctor because it's not

3750.15 --> 3754.6800000000003
just the knowledge well see I was

3752.82 --> 3756.09
telling my kid right like remember when

3754.68 --> 3758.46
yeah I don't think it was yesterday or

3756.09 --> 3760.6800000000003
the day before you said that if you

3758.46 --> 3762.9
needed surgery and you had to do it you

3760.68 --> 3765.99
did you would attempt it hit on yourself

3762.9 --> 3769.98
you know surgery yeah I'm in it and I

3765.99 --> 3772.6499999999996
don't know my kids like I'm I don't know

3769.98 --> 3776.13
it for me it's like okay well I trust

3772.65 --> 3778.9700000000003
myself right and I have good hand skills

3776.13 --> 3781.62
like I have potentially surgery hands

3778.97 --> 3783.6899999999996
because of the goldsmith and I'm very

3781.62 --> 3786.33
good at that too and it's kind of the

3783.69 --> 3791.46
skill required for that so that's why

3786.33 --> 3793.62
I'm saying yeah okay I was telling my

3791.46 --> 3797.13
kid I was like that's why I like you man

3793.62 --> 3799.2
because because he would attempt surgery

3797.13 --> 3801.3
on himself man that's the kind of dude

3799.2 --> 3804.5099999999998
that you want to be learning from you

3801.3 --> 3806.94
know like I guess I had attempted well I

3804.51 --> 3808.38
wouldn't use that as a standard point

3806.94 --> 3811.17
for that because there's a lot of

3808.38 --> 3814.32
weirdos that attempt to do surgery on

3811.17 --> 3820.11
themselves too and they're largely a bit

3814.32 --> 3821.6400000000003
yeah insane yes so what you think I know

3820.11 --> 3826.59
what you mean is just the way that you

3821.64 --> 3829.1099999999997
said it yeah you don't wanna just be

3826.59 --> 3831.48
some amateur surgeon you know like I'm

3829.11 --> 3831.81
just saying like if you were like in a

3831.48 --> 3833.4
bad

3831.81 --> 3836.07
situation you would attempt to fix

3833.4 --> 3838.71
yourself you know yes it's about the

3836.07 --> 3840.6000000000004
confidence and about like knowing what

3838.71 --> 3842.2200000000003
you can do and what you can do I think

3840.6 --> 3844.38
that is what you were trying to point

3842.22 --> 3846.9599999999996
out net knotted but oh look at that guy

3844.38 --> 3857.46
he's willing to do surgery on himself

3846.96 --> 3859.7400000000002
Wow you got to trust that it's the

3857.46 --> 3862.17
confidence and character like okay look

3859.74 --> 3863.58
I'm in a bad situation and my guts are

3862.17 --> 3865.98
hanging out I'm gonna go ahead and do

3863.58 --> 3869.13
surgery on myself you know that's

3865.98 --> 3871.14
confidence right there yeah well I think

3869.13 --> 3874.35
that would probably appreciate such

3871.14 --> 3876.0899999999997
things for example in the military yeah

3874.35 --> 3877.83
because in the military there's nothing

3876.09 --> 3880.8900000000003
worse than people panicking

3877.83 --> 3882.63
that's the worst right exactly no you

3880.89 --> 3885.6299999999997
don't want panic because that's that's

3882.63 --> 3887.4
when things get dangerous yeah yeah like

3885.63 --> 3889.26
the way they do it in the military well

3887.4 --> 3890.9100000000003
at least when I was in the military they

3889.26 --> 3893.73
don't want you to think at all you know

3890.91 --> 3897.0899999999997
they trained you to just act without

3893.73 --> 3898.68
even considering your own thoughts and

3897.09 --> 3902.25
you know like if they say jump in a fire

3898.68 --> 3905.2799999999997
you're just doing you know knowing that

3902.25 --> 3906.93
they knowing that they have a reason for

3905.28 --> 3910.17
you to jump in that fire that's going to

3906.93 --> 3914.7599999999998
be better for everybody yeah you know I

3910.17 --> 3916.59
don't know it's kind of explained good

3914.76 --> 3918.3
thing a while I was never deployed to

3916.59 --> 3925.71
any kind of war anything so I'm grateful

3918.3 --> 3928.4100000000003
for that but the training is enough we

3925.71 --> 3930.18
had this one exercise called Omaha Beach

3928.41 --> 3932.64
it was just a training exercise where

3930.18 --> 3934.71
they were firing rounds or live rounds

3932.64 --> 3936.6299999999997
over your head right and the rounds were

3934.71 --> 3938.25
there were student who probably about 15

3936.63 --> 3940.8900000000003
feet above your head so I mean it was

3938.25 --> 3942.63
way up there right but when live rounds

3940.89 --> 3945.5099999999998
are coming at you they feel like they're

3942.63 --> 3947.7000000000003
closer because you're scared you know

3945.51 --> 3949.6200000000003
what I mean and so like like like you

3947.7 --> 3951.81
you're crawling and you're afraid to

3949.62 --> 3954.29
stand up you know because you don't want

3951.81 --> 3957.54
to get I don't know that just has like a

3954.29 --> 3958.92
it doesn't feel like the rounds are that

3957.54 --> 3962.0099999999998
far away from you when there's live

3958.92 --> 3964.7400000000002
rounds well it could be that it is just

3962.01 --> 3965.19
a realization that if you panic and like

3964.74 --> 3967.29
try to

3965.19 --> 3970.069
get up to run away you'll be shocked and

3967.29 --> 3973.079
that realization is pretty unnerving

3970.069 --> 3975.15
because there is a cost or phobia effect

3973.079 --> 3977.9100000000003
to it you know being forced to stick to

3975.15 --> 3980.099
the ground or die that's a good way to

3977.91 --> 3983.27
put that's a good way to put it felt

3980.099 --> 3988.8900000000003
like claustrophobia right I can imagine

3983.27 --> 3990.42
yeah those are the good old days man see

3988.89 --> 3992.31
when I was in all that all they could

3990.42 --> 3994.05
think of is I wanted to get out but now

3992.31 --> 3999.45
I missed those days you know all the

3994.05 --> 4005.4100000000003

4025.01 --> 4032.3590000000004
Jeff do subscribe to good servant check

4027.68 --> 4035.96
him out yeah I'm so close to 500 now I'm

4032.359 --> 4038.0789999999997
sorry yeah when me and Tom started we

4035.96 --> 4041.63
had a tea subscription 80 subscribers

4038.079 --> 4044.329
and it's only been two months ago or

4041.63 --> 4046.1600000000003
whenever so I felt like that's fast

4044.329 --> 4049.19
that's we grew up fast

4046.16 --> 4051.2599999999998
you know that first did it it can either

4049.19 --> 4054.89
go very slow or if you already have

4051.26 --> 4058.73
momentum in a crowd then you can go

4054.89 --> 4061.5499999999997
pretty fast like it for me took a long

4058.73 --> 4063.859
time to get to 80 a long time because I

4061.55 --> 4067.4
at that time I literally didn't know

4063.859 --> 4070.0099999999998
anyone and there was like this shield

4067.4 --> 4073.9
paranoia going around to it you know so

4070.01 --> 4076.6400000000003
people didn't really just say okay sure

4073.9 --> 4078.53
we'll see plus like when you debate

4076.64 --> 4080.24
right and like that's where the

4078.53 --> 4083.51
excitement is is the debates right

4080.24 --> 4085.9399999999996
people have an opportunity to see you

4083.51 --> 4088.76
like at your best and that your way

4085.94 --> 4091.52
worst you know triggered and upset or

4088.76 --> 4095.0890000000004
whatever like it's hard to make friends

4091.52 --> 4096.589
and like and be like aren't like some

4095.089 --> 4098.09
people are just built for the debates

4096.589 --> 4100.15
like they have that talent

4098.09 --> 4102.68
but at the same time you can't be

4100.15 --> 4105.23
glad-handing everybody and be a debater

4102.68 --> 4106.64
at the same time it's hard to grow you

4105.23 --> 4108.349999999999
know because you need to be friends with

4106.64 --> 4110.6900000000005
everybody all friendly you know and

4108.35 --> 4117.320000000001
don't let anybody see you in any

4110.69 --> 4119.169999999999
embarrassing scenarios or whatever well

4117.32 --> 4122.15
that's not just not gonna work for me

4119.17 --> 4125.12
because if I'd have to take that type of

4122.15 --> 4128.36
attitude that would make me censor all

4125.12 --> 4131.21
or everything that I am and then ideally

4128.36 --> 4134.9
anyone I'd just be this person just see

4131.21 --> 4139.28
a very seemingly nervous about things

4134.9 --> 4143.33
that's yes to be proud of

4139.28 --> 4145.7
Arwen I think you you you know maybe it

4143.33 --> 4147.62
was a little slow or whatever but you

4145.7 --> 4149.66
know you built up you have a name around

4147.62 --> 4153.41
the flatterers community you know I

4149.66 --> 4153.86
guess I people are you know people know

4153.41 --> 4155.78
who you are

4153.86 --> 4158.36
you know and that's a good thing you

4155.78 --> 4161.54
know if if flat earth wasn't censored

4158.36 --> 4167.54
you guys would be 10 times as big all of

4161.54 --> 4169.5199999999995
you you know maybe you know if you were

4167.54 --> 4173.21
a ball earther you'd have 5000

4169.52 --> 4176.950000000001
subscribers you know if I'd have a

4173.21 --> 4182.05
baller I'd have 6 million subscribers

4176.95 --> 4182.05
and 6 million euros on my bank account

4182.65 --> 4187.429999999999
cuz I would tell anybody whatever they

4185.33 --> 4189.44
wanted yeah there's a new planet man

4187.43 --> 4190.88
it's awesome yeah there's an atmosphere

4189.44 --> 4193.969999999999
and everything then I'll show you

4190.88 --> 4196.1900000000005
pictures of it you know there was one

4193.97 --> 4197.81
guy they had it was I think it was on

4196.19 --> 4199.639999999999
this was a couple years ago I was

4197.81 --> 4201.71
watching a video the gern was doing or

4199.64 --> 4204.47
something live or whatever and it was

4201.71 --> 4207.53
like this guy had like a video of the

4204.47 --> 4209.42
Sun a live running video of the Sun they

4207.53 --> 4211.94
had like you know millions and millions

4209.42 --> 4215.27
of views man you know and it's obviously

4211.94 --> 4218.0
fake you know it's you know it's like a

4215.27 --> 4221.39
big fireball you know up close on a

4218.0 --> 4225.16
camera and people's you know watch that

4221.39 --> 4229.81
you know yeah of course it's garbage oh

4225.16 --> 4231.83
yeah there will be people knowing that

4229.81 --> 4234.410000000001
literally being informed

4231.83 --> 4238.58
that thing going life dragging in people

4234.41 --> 4241.13
wow you want to look like a priest they

4238.58 --> 4243.5
will be like the the knowers to the

4241.13 --> 4245.6
Konami's and they will drag people to

4243.5 --> 4248.0
there like look see we got a new

4245.6 --> 4251.06
high-tech update this is the latest

4248.0 --> 4253.31
that's how people see that and that's

4251.06 --> 4256.070000000001
why they get so much attention because

4253.31 --> 4258.530000000001
there's a whole horde of people that are

4256.07 --> 4261.65
using that as a religious thing

4258.53 --> 4265.07
happening a ritual they drag people

4261.65 --> 4266.75
towards that it makes me so sick

4265.07 --> 4269.84
especially when I'm looking at pictures

4266.75 --> 4272.42
of Pluto and like come on man there's

4269.84 --> 4274.01
like a dot of light in the sky and

4272.42 --> 4276.71
you're telling me that's a place that I

4274.01 --> 4278.51
could go and put my feet on I mean

4276.71 --> 4282.29
that's a that's a pretty big fish story

4278.51 --> 4285.9800000000005
man oh you could but your feet would

4282.29 --> 4288.95
freeze off that's fishy though man just

4285.98 --> 4292.009999999999
the whole space and everything I wonder

4288.95 --> 4295.22
if it was much weirder like how that

4292.01 --> 4298.97
photo was supposedly taken by a

4295.22 --> 4302.3
satellite that did a sideview flyby at

4298.97 --> 4305.39
like 10,000 miles per hour or something

4302.3 --> 4307.52
or much faster insane speeds like flying

4305.39 --> 4311.63
by the planet and had like a window of

4307.52 --> 4314.0
like half a second or less and he made a

4311.63 --> 4317.66
sideward picture that was perfectly

4314.0 --> 4319.19
sharp now there is something that

4317.66 --> 4321.889999999999
doesn't make any sense to me

4319.19 --> 4324.2
that part not that it's a freaking

4321.89 --> 4327.02
planet supposedly in outer space that

4324.2 --> 4332.48
makes more sense to me than that a photo

4327.02 --> 4334.67
could be taken that way not only is it

4332.48 --> 4336.799999999999
that thing flying by ten thousand miles

4334.67 --> 4339.47
an hour or whatever and got a second to

4336.8 --> 4342.05
take a picture but the planet itself is

4339.47 --> 4344.39
following the Sun at breakneck speeds

4342.05 --> 4346.43
all around space two million miles this

4344.39 --> 4351.14
way and four hundred thousand miles an

4346.43 --> 4353.570000000001
hour that way and going yeah but it's

4351.14 --> 4355.88
how did you take a photograph of that

4353.57 --> 4360.7699999999995
you know and people believe it they eat

4355.88 --> 4363.4890000000005
it up and it's you know a graph for you

4360.77 --> 4365.9800000000005
yet open the lens

4363.489 --> 4367.419999999999
cap and then you let light come through

4365.98 --> 4370.449
and then you're ready I'm much more

4367.42 --> 4373.86
puzzled as to how that satellite thingy

4370.449 --> 4376.659
flying through space also was able to

4373.86 --> 4380.11
transfer a high-resolution digital

4376.659 --> 4382.48
picture over that distance how did they

4380.11 --> 4385.989
do it through Radio City how was that

4382.48 --> 4388.48
signal coming in from something that's

4385.989 --> 4390.82
occurring at almost astronomical speeds

4388.48 --> 4394.209999999999
away from the earth how did that signal

4390.82 --> 4397.78
transfer so cleanly to earth in order to

4394.21 --> 4401.079
receive a full resolution picture that's

4397.78 --> 4403.09
also everything what file did they use

4401.079 --> 4407.768999999999
to send that photograph from the

4403.09 --> 4411.900000000001
satellite to an asset what kind of file

4407.769 --> 4414.969
is that they sent over the Internet like

4411.9 --> 4416.86
there's no problem Ian Pearson it

4414.969 --> 4419.469
doesn't it's about the amount of data

4416.86 --> 4421.719
and how did they send it in such

4419.469 --> 4424.96
conditions or in space over that

4421.719 --> 4429.249
distance from an object moving away very

4424.96 --> 4433.15
fast so the distance is increasing while

4429.249 --> 4436.69
the signal is being sent how right why

4433.15 --> 4439.96
is it there why isn't there any rate a

4436.69 --> 4442.509999999999
loss in the picture that's more baffling

4439.96 --> 4444.7300000000005
they would it would get away with it if

4442.51 --> 4446.829000000001
they showed us like foggy pictures or

4444.73 --> 4448.718999999999
like weird book you know like oh look

4446.829 --> 4451.21
there's a little anomaly up there you

4448.719 --> 4453.67
know like a little slick of like a smear

4451.21 --> 4455.559
you know I would almost believe that you

4453.67 --> 4459.61
know but to have like a crystal-clear

4455.559 --> 4461.8
image of Saturn and and and and Pluto

4459.61 --> 4466.058999999999
and all this other get out of here with

4461.8 --> 4468.7300000000005
that Saturn heated up but Saturn is at

4466.059 --> 4471.309
least much bigger it's not as extremely

4468.73 --> 4474.009999999999
far away as Pluto is like absurdly far

4471.309 --> 4476.9800000000005
away that's the that's the thing the

4474.01 --> 4480.34
farthest yeah well why did it's very

4476.98 --> 4482.11
small as well what happened to it to

4480.34 --> 4486.9400000000005
where it's not a planet anymore did it

4482.11 --> 4490.598999999999
get less bright or something or why is

4486.94 --> 4493.869
it not a planet it's just I don't know

4490.599 --> 4495.79
nonce nonsense controversy among the

4493.869 --> 4498.79
priests

4495.79 --> 4500.98
to make people sides within the paradigm

4498.79 --> 4503.98
no Pluto is a planet door it should me

4500.98 --> 4507.099999999999
plan you always a planet it's just

4503.98 --> 4509.08
created controversy nonsense it probably

4507.1 --> 4511.2390000000005
has to do with the size of it and like

4509.08 --> 4513.34
is it still the planet then what about

4511.239 --> 4515.41
the asteroid belt there are many

4513.34 --> 4518.650000000001
asteroids supposedly in there that are

4515.41 --> 4521.5
the size of Pluto aren't they blah blah

4518.65 --> 4523.15
blah blah blah don't people ever like

4521.5 --> 4525.91
factor in that there's like there's like

4523.15 --> 4528.94
structures right that are like made of

4525.91 --> 4532.09
stone right that are like lined up with

4528.94 --> 4535.719
like stars that are always lined up

4532.09 --> 4538.4490000000005
every year you know exactly perfect like

4535.719 --> 4540.46
how could we be flying around and have

4538.449 --> 4543.009999999999
the exact same stars be in the exact

4540.46 --> 4546.58
same place every year after year after

4543.01 --> 4549.969
year you know there's just too many and

4546.58 --> 4551.65
already and then and then and then I

4549.969 --> 4554.19
have to hear about someone saying oh any

4551.65 --> 4559.299999999999
proof or flutter but no proof no crew

4554.19 --> 4564.599999999999
still no proof yeah we see the Sun 24

4559.3 --> 4564.6
hours a day if it's a fiery ball on disk

4564.84 --> 4570.13
your same reason I can't see your light

4568.57 --> 4571.719
in your room from my house you know

4570.13 --> 4575.679
because it's too far away

4571.719 --> 4579.58
no you know that's not the answer no

4575.679 --> 4581.9490000000005
it's not it it's just not a fiery ball

4579.58 --> 4585.179
hanging over this there's nothing I know

4581.949 --> 4587.199
it's too far away that's already a disc

4585.179 --> 4590.38
machination I can't call it anything

4587.199 --> 4594.28
else because it is not far away there is

4590.38 --> 4596.32
no proof of distance when it goes down

4594.28 --> 4598.63
the horizon it doesn't change its

4596.32 --> 4600.88
angular speed in order for you to be

4598.63 --> 4605.5
able to presume detection going far away

4600.88 --> 4608.32
no it's just 15 degrees it's not going

4605.5 --> 4611.05
in a distance that's a good point that

4608.32 --> 4613.69
doesn't increase its speed that's based

4611.05 --> 4616.6
on that's like a machination that I I

4613.69 --> 4619.0
don't even want to put any anything

4616.6 --> 4622.410000000001
necessarily nefarious onto it

4619.0 --> 4624.88
necessarily like people like Rob Skiba

4622.41 --> 4626.92
wise have done that

4624.88 --> 4629.07
in their defense against of all

4626.92 --> 4633.87
arguments like why a son

4629.07 --> 4636.09
over a disc why yeah they're making up

4633.87 --> 4640.05
excuses for that overlooking that there

4636.09 --> 4643.5
is no angular speed change during it go

4640.05 --> 4646.08
right I've been saying that word

4643.5 --> 4648.72
three for years now and be just being

4646.08 --> 4650.46
ignored it's just too inconvenient well

4648.72 --> 4652.29
it's almost the way you're saying it

4650.46 --> 4658.77
it's almost like it's impossible for it

4652.29 --> 4663.0
to be a physical object yeah I know it's

4658.77 --> 4665.370000000001
not even possible well it might be in

4663.0 --> 4668.22
some way but first you got to find some

4665.37 --> 4670.17
kind of indication of an objective but

4668.22 --> 4672.84
in order to get that you have to

4670.17 --> 4675.12
establish proximity and there's things

4672.84 --> 4677.7300000000005
coming up empty perspective change

4675.12 --> 4680.55
angular size change when things move

4677.73 --> 4683.16
into the distance in relation to the

4680.55 --> 4685.2
observer it will seem to go slower and

4683.16 --> 4687.03
slower and slower as it goes into this

4685.2 --> 4689.58
is natural consequence of physical

4687.03 --> 4694.0199999999995
objects moving into the distance well

4689.58 --> 4697.26
it's not there so you know what about

4694.02 --> 4701.22
heat is that the heats gotta be coming

4697.26 --> 4704.070000000001
from somewhere yeah it's coming from the

4701.22 --> 4707.490000000001
surface interaction with the light

4704.07 --> 4711.08
that's where the heat comes from there's

4707.49 --> 4713.4
no more light for radiation from the Sun

4711.08 --> 4716.37
that doesn't work it's just the heat

4713.4 --> 4718.889999999999
hitting matter that's where the light

4716.37 --> 4720.3
infrared light of motors hitting the

4718.89 --> 4724.29
matter that's where the heat comes from

4720.3 --> 4725.85
that's heat comes from the ground you

4724.29 --> 4729.18
can't have light without matter right

4725.85 --> 4730.620000000001
you have to have a relationship with you

4729.18 --> 4734.360000000001
you can't see light unless it's

4730.62 --> 4736.61
interacting with matter well seeing is

4734.36 --> 4740.339999999999
like interacting with matter

4736.61 --> 4742.65
there's no matter there's yeah but there

4740.34 --> 4745.74
is so there is no place where there is

4742.65 --> 4747.75
no matter and light is even a factor but

4745.74 --> 4751.139999999999
in a vacuum there is matter it's just

4747.75 --> 4754.19
less of it the more I learn about light

4751.14 --> 4756.87
the less I really know about it you know

4754.19 --> 4759.12
it's just so much so many different ways

4756.87 --> 4762.54
you can go with it it's just so

4759.12 --> 4765.2699999999995
different from matter in so many ways

4762.54 --> 4768.18
and science have found scientists have

4765.27 --> 4771.150000000001
just gone out of their way to somehow

4768.18 --> 4772.89
make it into matter or like put the

4771.15 --> 4775.2
light and the matter into the same

4772.89 --> 4778.04
spectrum in every way they could find

4775.2 --> 4780.48
when it's so clearly not the same thing

4778.04 --> 4781.95
it's just their foot out there's matter

4780.48 --> 4784.74
and there's light and there are

4781.95 --> 4786.87
relations and interactions it's just two

4784.74 --> 4788.8099999999995
completely different things in so many

4786.87 --> 4791.16
ways

4788.81 --> 4798.120000000001
yeah but they want to make light into a

4791.16 --> 4801.0599999999995
photon yeah right into into a piece of

4798.12 --> 4803.22
matter instead of just saying this is a

4801.06 --> 4807.96
piece of light they want to say this is

4803.22 --> 4809.43
the smallest light can get right you

4807.96 --> 4812.04
know what I mean like instead of saying

4809.43 --> 4814.29
okay well you can divide it forever what

4812.04 --> 4816.24
if they could show me how you can halt

4814.29 --> 4819.87
light you know if light if it's a

4816.24 --> 4822.78
particle and it has a speed well

4819.87 --> 4827.37
okay go ahead and slow it down to a halt

4822.78 --> 4829.889999999999
then and prove that yeah but then you'd

4827.37 --> 4831.24
be saying yeah you'd be saying like okay

4829.89 --> 4834.660000000001
I like turning on a flashlight it's like

4831.24 --> 4840.719999999999
turning on a hose then and it's

4834.66 --> 4845.34
completely different not really a it's a

4840.72 --> 4847.26
good metaphor it's just a it manifests

4845.34 --> 4849.360000000001
it like a critical mass of energy

4847.26 --> 4851.67
usually happens in some way electricity

4849.36 --> 4856.86
often in the matter and then the matter

4851.67 --> 4858.93
starts yeah radiating the light and the

4856.86 --> 4861.389999999999
light moves until it's all absorbed

4858.93 --> 4863.25
again by the matter if you if you put

4861.39 --> 4865.5
water in a bucket you have a bucket of

4863.25 --> 4867.12
water if you shine light in a bucket you

4865.5 --> 4868.77
don't have a bucket of light you know

4867.12 --> 4870.9
what I mean like that's the difference

4868.77 --> 4873.570000000001
that's right then yeah there is no

4870.9 --> 4876.139999999999
separate light light is only a thing

4873.57 --> 4878.94
that manifests between matter as it were

4876.14 --> 4882.84
yeah yeah I don't know why they keep

4878.94 --> 4885.419999999999
trying to put it in that box when it so

4882.84 --> 4886.74
clearly a completely different it's

4885.42 --> 4888.78
different than two people now turn

4886.74 --> 4891.66
everything into a ball and they want to

4888.78 --> 4892.69
turn everything into a unified scale of

4891.66 --> 4896.2699999999995
everything

4892.69 --> 4902.0599999999995
you know I'm all those because it's

4896.27 --> 4904.160000000001
easier then and it's crazy like I used

4902.06 --> 4906.830000000001
to think science was all figured out on

4904.16 --> 4911.93
earth but we humans don't know anything

4906.83 --> 4914.45
I mean very little you know no I really

4911.93 --> 4917.51
think we know a lot is just the problem

4914.45 --> 4919.91
that when you start to realize you don't

4917.51 --> 4921.83
know as much as you want to that some

4919.91 --> 4924.17
people will start to fill that in with

4921.83 --> 4926.78
nonsense and then claim they know a lot

4924.17 --> 4932.06
and that actually prevents other people

4926.78 --> 4935.12
from getting more knowledge yeah I gotta

4932.06 --> 4938.240000000001
let you go Arwen alright it was you know

4935.12 --> 4940.16
that was good ya know I always enjoy

4938.24 --> 4942.0199999999995
talking to you man I could probably do a

4940.16 --> 4942.41
show every day with you you know what I

4942.02 --> 4944.870000000001
mean

4942.41 --> 4947.17
just slap it on record and throw it up

4944.87 --> 4950.0599999999995
there yeah alright well I'm getting a

4947.17 --> 4954.41
probably a discord room somewhere soon

4950.06 --> 4956.330000000001
over at Betty's and we great yeah it

4954.41 --> 4960.26
would be fun if you could maybe be part

4956.33 --> 4962.69
of that who knows where we could go with

4960.26 --> 4966.47
that you know I might even lend it to

4962.69 --> 4969.799999999999
you for your own shows so you might have

4966.47 --> 4972.110000000001
people on sounds great it's really

4969.8 --> 4975.71
because it's a good system it's becoming

4972.11 --> 4977.15
better also well if I was able to go

4975.71 --> 4978.77
live I think that'd be great you know

4977.15 --> 4981.139999999999
cuz I think people want to interact with

4978.77 --> 4984.410000000001
with our show too but it's it's earlier

4981.14 --> 4986.12
than your show so it you know I may be

4984.41 --> 4988.97
old for overseas would be good but it's

4986.12 --> 4992.9
like I'm up at 3:45 to do our show in

4988.97 --> 4995.87
the morning out in California so yeah

4992.9 --> 4997.429999999999
right anyway yeah all right yeah thanks

4995.87 --> 5000.3099999999995
for waiting here it was good

4997.43 --> 5010.21
yeah all right it was good talking to

5000.31 --> 5012.5
Arlen god bless you god bless you yeah

5010.21 --> 5016.61
that was nice

5012.5 --> 5020.71
I said fluid talk that's good I like

5016.61 --> 5020.71
that should do it more often

5023.32 --> 5026.509999999999
[Music]

5040.84 --> 5049.2300000000005
a conspiracy cats could you please stop

5044.73 --> 5053.349999999999
prodding at my followers

5049.23 --> 5056.41
it's no good doing that yeah I haven't

5053.35 --> 5058.54
really looked into chat having this

5056.41 --> 5060.67
conversation with good service do

5058.54 --> 5063.0
subscribe to him check him out he's a

5060.67 --> 5067.75
great guy

5063.0 --> 5072.16
and yeah I think the show is definitely

5067.75 --> 5075.97
worth listening at times oh thank you

5072.16 --> 5079.29
good servant for that $1 11 super chat

5075.97 --> 5079.29
donation much appreciated

5095.5 --> 5104.11
that's ridiculous alright okay

5102.16 --> 5106.2699999999995
conspiracy catch you're merely pointing

5104.11 --> 5109.389999999999
out how unlikely it is that nobody ever

5106.27 --> 5111.070000000001
in history would spill the beans what's

5109.39 --> 5116.650000000001
your proof that nobody ever in history

5111.07 --> 5121.929999999999
has filled the beans like that's a weird

5116.65 --> 5125.7699999999995
assertion to make wouldn't it be more

5121.93 --> 5128.7390000000005
likely to to just assume that people

5125.77 --> 5131.650000000001
have spilt the beans and that that

5128.739 --> 5135.489
spilling of the beans was then contained

5131.65 --> 5137.799999999999
and then it didn't leak through it was

5135.489 --> 5142.2699999999995
stuck in that time and that's it and

5137.8 --> 5144.64
that that is how it seems like nobody is

5142.27 --> 5149.9490000000005
spilling the beans no they are it's just

5144.64 --> 5152.79
not gonna reach you now that's real

5149.949 --> 5152.79
censorship

5169.579 --> 5176.049999999999
and that's as the sloppiest

5171.26 --> 5176.05
electrician's around I if you say so

5185.55 --> 5193.35
yeah you know conspiracy cats just

5188.58 --> 5195.54
imagine it like this if if somebody like

5193.35 --> 5197.76
me not realizing how the world really

5195.54 --> 5199.65
works if I would be working somewhere at

5197.76 --> 5200.76
a company and I'd see like really bad

5199.65 --> 5204.45
things and [ __ ]

5200.76 --> 5205.8
I'd be reporting that to the company I'd

5204.45 --> 5211.349999999999
be like hey there's something worrying

5205.8 --> 5213.54
going on here you know like I felt that

5211.35 --> 5215.1900000000005
I need to inform you because this I feel

5213.54 --> 5216.78
this might be dangerous or bad for the

5215.19 --> 5219.11
company or whatever and they'd be like

5216.78 --> 5221.94
oh thank you thank you yeah yeah yeah

5219.11 --> 5225.719999999999
keep us informed but let's keep this to

5221.94 --> 5227.879999999999
ourselves you know and then and yeah I

5225.72 --> 5230.25
wouldn't probably even realize that the

5227.88 --> 5234.12
person that I would be reporting to in

5230.25 --> 5238.07
Goodwill trying to insert logos that

5234.12 --> 5242.64
they would effectively be my gatekeeper

5238.07 --> 5246.299999999999
they would be there to make me feel like

5242.64 --> 5248.43
I'm fixing the situation but effectively

5246.3 --> 5252.18
preventing me from fixing the situation

5248.43 --> 5254.280000000001
or rather the more practical outcome of

5252.18 --> 5257.1900000000005
that me getting ejected from the company

5254.28 --> 5259.37
so that is how a lot of things happen

5257.19 --> 5259.37
out there

5292.41 --> 5298.38
oh that's very easy conspiracy cats how

5296.04 --> 5302.24
can that be done when it takes months to

5298.38 --> 5307.47
travel it's very simple you plan very

5302.24 --> 5310.219999999999
very very far ahead of time and then it

5307.47 --> 5313.35
doesn't matter that it takes an eternity

5310.22 --> 5315.96
to travel because you have all the time

5313.35 --> 5320.3
in the world you just gotta have the

5315.96 --> 5322.77
plan already have the information ready

5320.3 --> 5325.77
planted at the right places take your

5322.77 --> 5332.64
time make sure it stays there for all

5325.77 --> 5334.38
eternity by obviously the majority there

5332.64 --> 5337.14
around there don't even realize what it

5334.38 --> 5340.38
is and that's how you plant it despite

5337.14 --> 5342.780000000001
incredibly long traveling times what the

5340.38 --> 5346.62
Jesuits did originally when they went

5342.78 --> 5350.389999999999
around the entire world sought out all

5346.62 --> 5355.26
the religious leaders kill some of them

5350.39 --> 5359.280000000001
and how they planted their info way way

5355.26 --> 5361.320000000001
ahead of any actual unveiling of it it

5359.28 --> 5363.12
was still a cult that's how it work

5361.32 --> 5366.929999999999
that's called information you spread

5363.12 --> 5372.7699999999995
information way way way before it's even

5366.93 --> 5372.77
going to be used that's how that works

5378.94 --> 5384.099999999999
conspiracy cats how can anybody have

5382.33 --> 5385.57
power and control of all nations in

5384.1 --> 5389.38
Earth and control centuries without

5385.57 --> 5391.42
anybody knowing they are there well

5389.38 --> 5395.86
people did know they are there it's just

5391.42 --> 5401.02
that nobody was gonna do anything about

5395.86 --> 5403.29
it cuz yeah they just made sure they

5401.02 --> 5405.9400000000005
were needed

5403.29 --> 5410.08
if you ever consider that conspiracy

5405.94 --> 5411.82
cats you know there's like this group of

5410.08 --> 5413.199
like [ __ ] up people you know they're

5411.82 --> 5417.58
messed up they don't have proper

5413.199 --> 5422.159
principles and all that but yeah they're

5417.58 --> 5424.9
in control and you can still like

5422.159 --> 5427.87
discuss with them like how to properly

5424.9 --> 5430.9
manage the people and all that then yeah

5427.87 --> 5432.76
as long as they just don't let the

5430.9 --> 5437.949
people starve or stress out too much

5432.76 --> 5440.320000000001
you're gonna let them keep doing that at

5437.949 --> 5447.449
least for the time being until you can't

5440.32 --> 5452.44
but it's all people all making decisions

5447.449 --> 5456.699
- yeah with whatever they think they're

5452.44 --> 5458.5599999999995
being presented with at the time and

5456.699 --> 5460.599999999999
most people are just concerned about

5458.56 --> 5465.070000000001
their life and what the world is like

5460.6 --> 5467.4400000000005
right then and what they can do they

5465.07 --> 5469.449
don't even have the luxury to go there

5467.44 --> 5475.449
with their mind like oh maybe things are

5469.449 --> 5477.299999999999
like planned hundreds of years they just

5475.449 --> 5481.049999999999
don't understand they can't handle that

5477.3 --> 5481.05
they don't have the room

5497.76 --> 5502.22
yeah that's a good point Missouri Bear

5510.79 --> 5517.869
[Music]

5522.16 --> 5525.76
[Music]

5537.43 --> 5540.6
[Music]

5547.809 --> 5555.469
yeah I've got conspiracy cats can you

5552.86 --> 5557.869
please stop trying to strawman with your

5555.469 --> 5560.5
conversation with Zubair I already

5557.869 --> 5565.369
answered the question that you asked him

5560.5 --> 5567.559
right how can a small number of secret

5565.369 --> 5569.63
people control the entire planet the

5567.559 --> 5572.84
world for centuries and not be

5569.63 --> 5577.78
discovered ever by anyone well they have

5572.84 --> 5577.78
been discovered it just didn't come out

5579.46 --> 5585.92
again you assume that like no attention

5583.46 --> 5588.889
ever has figured that out now that's

5585.92 --> 5592.1900000000005
dumb to assume that that's really stupid

5588.889 --> 5595.639
and naive people are smart people do

5592.19 --> 5598.669999999999
wise up people do figure things out the

5595.639 --> 5601.4890000000005
problem is as an individual in a world

5598.67 --> 5603.9490000000005
you don't always know exactly what to do

5601.489 --> 5607.489
with it when you figure it out

5603.949 --> 5610.308999999999
some may boldly try to expose these

5607.489 --> 5614.15
things and then the Machine with power

5610.309 --> 5618.110000000001
and soldiers and blackmailed control

5614.15 --> 5620.36
will just take you out back in the day

5618.11 --> 5622.549999999999
that was possible without a lot of

5620.36 --> 5624.17
judicial repercussions or even

5622.55 --> 5626.0
repercussions from the people there was

5624.17 --> 5626.96
not a lot of information spread so that

5626.0 --> 5628.73
could just happen

5626.96 --> 5631.46
and it would work out for the

5628.73 --> 5636.678999999999
controller's nowadays there's mass media

5631.46 --> 5640.039
and like everything like the whole yes

5636.679 --> 5641.9
so the whole social perspective is

5640.039 --> 5643.789
completely changed on everything the

5641.9 --> 5646.96
nobility is not really what it used to

5643.789 --> 5650.75
be in that way no more religious

5646.96 --> 5653.17
connotations to that so it just can't

5650.75 --> 5656.92
work like that anymore

5653.17 --> 5656.92
but it used to

5690.859 --> 5696.4890000000005
okay conspiracy cats I'm addressing you

5694.429 --> 5699.589
I don't know if you put my show on mute

5696.489 --> 5702.619
but you're gonna break off this

5699.589 --> 5704.949
conversation with Missouri Bear and

5702.619 --> 5707.3589999999995
you're gonna address me now

5704.949 --> 5709.669
because I have been answering your

5707.359 --> 5712.939
questions and you seem to be ignoring me

5709.669 --> 5716.749
which I do not take lately I don't like

5712.939 --> 5719.389
that when the actual speaking show host

5716.749 --> 5723.349
is being ignored by somebody in their

5719.389 --> 5726.579
chat when I address you don't like that

5723.349 --> 5726.579
conspiracy cats

5750.66 --> 5757.139999999999

[Music]

6061.79 --> 6074.41
obvious mason really good servants you

think why I don't think so

6087.67 --> 6096.5
reflecting his work really okay I'm not

6094.13 --> 6099.47
letting that one go cats conspiracy can

6096.5 --> 6100.33

6103.37 --> 6113.0
just said there so you tell me how this

6108.53 --> 6119.0199999999995
beautiful quote of Werner from brown on

6113.0 --> 6119.02
his tombstone reflected his work you

6119.29 --> 6127.3
explained that in check right now better

6125.93 --> 6130.97
be good

6127.3 --> 6133.67
doubt it will be because that's just the

6130.97 --> 6137.360000000001
most nonsensical garbage thing I've ever

6133.67 --> 6141.1
heard anybody say like how does that

6137.36 --> 6145.849999999999
freakin Bible quote of the firmament

6141.1 --> 6148.150000000001
reflect Varner Franz Browns world work

6145.85 --> 6152.200000000001
what the hell

6148.15 --> 6157.54
older celestial sphere is his firmament

6152.2 --> 6161.5
really so how does this presuppose

6157.54 --> 6164.18
celestial sphere the outer space

6161.5 --> 6167.87
provided God's handiwork and how does

6164.18 --> 6173.84
that reflect his work you better start

6167.87 --> 6176.75
to make sense of it really quick how

6173.84 --> 6182.35
does it reflect his work werner from

6176.75 --> 6182.35
Browns work conspiracy cats

6200.76 --> 6203.6
really

6205.559 --> 6208.189
Wow

6209.26 --> 6220.12
the celestial sphere you say but I

6214.5 --> 6225.22
thought it said firmament it's not a

6220.12 --> 6231.43
celestial sphere it's very distinctly

6225.22 --> 6233.860000000001
different words like Celestia Celeste is

6231.43 --> 6237.63
not in there it's a firmament firmament

6233.86 --> 6242.679999999999
is not celestial so very different

6237.63 --> 6247.06
routed words their original source the

6242.68 --> 6251.31
words very different also you can guess

6247.06 --> 6251.31
you can guess it Kenya

6260.41 --> 6268.26
oh he didn't say dere's a dome and the

6263.62 --> 6272.7699999999995
earth is flat oh he didn't say that but

6268.26 --> 6278.71
he said yeah the firmament showeth his

6272.77 --> 6281.410000000001
handiwork that's what that quote is

6278.71 --> 6283.69
right it's not change you can does not

6281.41 --> 6294.13
like you can't just exchange another

6283.69 --> 6296.53
word for that yeah and by the way why

6294.13 --> 6302.2300000000005
would he have to say the earth is ready

6296.53 --> 6304.8099999999995
to down go the whole [ __ ] world NASA

6302.23 --> 6306.94
everybody is just saying hello the earth

6304.81 --> 6313.21
is flat and there sit down they should

6306.94 --> 6315.219999999999
down down flat dog dome yeah that's what

6313.21 --> 6318.13
you need don't you that's what you need

6315.22 --> 6321.7300000000005
and probably if they do that if there

6318.13 --> 6323.86
was a 24/7 output of NASA and all that

6321.73 --> 6327.61
in the government with the dome we

6323.86 --> 6329.98
should go is flat it's a dome you still

6327.61 --> 6333.25
wouldn't listen you still wouldn't you'd

6329.98 --> 6335.7699999999995
still think Oh government's come crazy

6333.25 --> 6338.11
does it make any sense anymore because

6335.77 --> 6340.6900000000005
they're saying the earth is flat and

6338.11 --> 6342.969999999999
there's a go there's a dome I'm just not

6340.69 --> 6344.71
gonna listen anymore because the

6342.97 --> 6348.91
government's not telling me the earth is

6344.71 --> 6350.92
a ball it's like there is nothing anyone

6348.91 --> 6357.16
in this world could tell you at this

6350.92 --> 6359.89
point is there it's just gonna be a ball

6357.16 --> 6362.5599999999995
in your mind until you die isn't it

6359.89 --> 6364.3
conspiracy gets you're gonna die with

6362.56 --> 6369.070000000001
that [ __ ] ball in your head aren't

6364.3 --> 6371.4400000000005
you anybody in the [ __ ] world could

6369.07 --> 6374.62
tell you the whole literal world could

6371.44 --> 6378.73
tell you hello conspiracy cats the earth

6374.62 --> 6382.74
is flat there's no outer space and you

6378.73 --> 6382.74
just wouldn't listen no matter what

6384.24 --> 6389.91
maybe it just requires a certain

6387.19 --> 6393.219
religious type of ending for this maybe

6389.91 --> 6396.67
these ballers just need to be put

6393.219 --> 6403.12
on a rocket in a pod and then lunged

6396.67 --> 6405.34
straight up until they say splat I think

6403.12 --> 6408.489
maybe that's just how that needs to end

6405.34 --> 6411.46
for for a lot of them and they'll do it

6408.489 --> 6414.429999999999
they'll do it themselves they'll double

6411.46 --> 6418.3
down they'll splat themselves against

6414.43 --> 6421.81
yeah the end of the container just for

6418.3 --> 6424.39
their dream love it please do it go

6421.81 --> 6427.63
ahead and organize this somebody go and

6424.39 --> 6429.58
organize some mass space journey with a

6427.63 --> 6431.89
rocket or whatever in a pot on it and

6429.58 --> 6436.87
just splat them all in the [ __ ]

6431.89 --> 6439.42
firmament just do it please give them

6436.87 --> 6442.239
the religious ending they crave for

6439.42 --> 6444.37
because nothing ever is gonna convince

6442.239 --> 6454.66
them the [ __ ] earth is anything other

6444.37 --> 6458.98
than a stupid little ball yeah I know

6454.66 --> 6461.139999999999
rest I had of course some people just

6458.98 --> 6463.2699999999995
have no life so they have to wait for me

6461.14 --> 6465.13
to do something silly and then they can

6463.27 --> 6468.370000000001
feel like they're alive again for a few

6465.13 --> 6472.09
seconds and and built their database of

6468.37 --> 6475.39
silly moments for our win because just

6472.09 --> 6478.18
like they need that silly moment they

6475.39 --> 6481.27
need that those happenings of their

6478.18 --> 6483.610000000001
silly moments to make that into a

6481.27 --> 6486.27
specific movie in their mind so can

6483.61 --> 6488.799999999999
stare at those silly moments and then

6486.27 --> 6491.290000000001
reflect upon those silly moments to

6488.8 --> 6493.150000000001
purely justify why everything else

6491.29 --> 6495.64
that's not those silly moments is

6493.15 --> 6497.5
completely useless because if they just

6495.64 --> 6500.860000000001
have this tape in their mind like oh

6497.5 --> 6504.25
this crazy moments then our win can be

6500.86 --> 6507.79
crazy that's how it needs to be for them

6504.25 --> 6510.34
because they don't want to even consider

6507.79 --> 6513.25
the moments in between the silliness

6510.34 --> 6518.2300000000005
that I might actually have a very good

6513.25 --> 6520.12
point there you just can't handle it so

6518.23 --> 6523.178999999999
that's why I just have to hand on these

6520.12 --> 6525.7
weird little moments because it just

6523.179 --> 6529.93
pisses me off just

6525.7 --> 6532.9
like maybe I'll just have to do that to

6529.93 --> 6535.3
make them go there to really make them

6532.9 --> 6539.16
[ __ ] kill themselves for their

6535.3 --> 6543.04
[ __ ] stupid religion maybe just need

6539.16 --> 6545.92
to be seen as stupid just for these

6543.04 --> 6549.22
[ __ ] people to rid themselves just

6545.92 --> 6553.18

conduct to prevent problems prevent

6649.26 --> 6654.209
unnecessary polarization right that's

6652.619 --> 6657.659
not what's happening that's not the

6654.209 --> 6661.559
polite you're using no you are adamantly

6657.659 --> 6664.549999999999
polarized persisting not to get touched

6661.559 --> 6668.28
by anything while you are absolutely

6664.55 --> 6671.13
inflexible and just assert your

6668.28 --> 6673.079
religious nonsense because you're not

just this thing with conspiracy cats is

6744.83 --> 6749.39
built up for a couple of days and it's

6746.57 --> 6752.36
just gotten worse and then it's just

6749.39 --> 6755.570000000001
stupid virtue signaling with his

6752.36 --> 6759.11
politeness we don't give a [ __ ] about

6755.57 --> 6761.9
your politeness if you're just gonna use

6759.11 --> 6764.75
a divert you signal about how good you

6761.9 --> 6769.73
are and that justifies you being an

6764.75 --> 6773.39
absolute [ __ ] and a liar to yourself

6769.73 --> 6775.429999999999

6855.07 --> 6861.67
deserve to basically go and curse like

6858.01 --> 6863.59
that and just offend my dissatisfaction

6861.67 --> 6868.36
with this idiot because he's not worth

6863.59 --> 6870.9400000000005
it and now even that I bill up to this

6868.36 --> 6872.759999999999
and do this it just feels like it wasn't

6870.94 --> 6875.889999999999
worth it I'd like almost wish I just

6872.76 --> 6877.87
hadn't even I should have just been him

6875.89 --> 6884.25
like a ride away I should have known it

6877.87 --> 6884.25
would lead to this it just pisses me off

6888.78 --> 6899.459
but this guy is a [ __ ] teacher

6891.9 --> 6902.909
[Music]

6899.459 --> 6909.269
yeah I never even got to mention the

6902.909 --> 6911.82
freakin title of the show this is Thank

6909.269 --> 6914.309
You Rasta that's that's cheering me up

6911.82 --> 6916.349
but it didn't even get to mention like

6914.309 --> 6917.459
the weirdness of the title of the show

6916.349 --> 6919.679
not even once

6917.459 --> 6922.559
how bizarre that's been two hours I

6919.679 --> 6924.78
haven't even said it yet so yeah why is

6922.559 --> 6927.539
the title like this Shawn hawkins thinks

6924.78 --> 6931.249
water vapor is not a gas because that's

6927.539 --> 6934.228999999999
what Shawn Hawkins said with his voice

6931.249 --> 6936.769
recorded and then when asked about he

6934.229 --> 6939.570000000001
actually doubled down on that like yeah

6936.769 --> 6945.17
yeah what a vapor isn't a gas because

6939.57 --> 6950.429
water gas only happens with electrolysis

6945.17 --> 6954.809
like he literally make that mistake not

6950.429 --> 6960.4490000000005
realizing that water gas as it's called

6954.809 --> 6963.689
is not actually water it's what happens

6960.449 --> 6965.28
when you split up water it becomes very

6963.689 --> 6967.289000000001
inflamed well it's not water though

6965.28 --> 6970.739
because it's not gonna condense in that

6967.289 --> 6973.369
state ever again until it's ignited then

6970.739 --> 6977.669999999999
it becomes water again then whatever

6973.369 --> 6984.808999999999
right so he think Shawn Hawkins thinks

6977.67 --> 6986.4890000000005
that water gas is water or is not water

6984.809 --> 6990.09
anymore and that's the only state it

6986.489 --> 6995.938999999999
doesn't realize that when you evaporate

6990.09 --> 7001.209
water it's still water and it's not tiny

6995.939 --> 7007.4890000000005
droplets hanging in between the gas it's

7001.209 --> 7010.039
actually gas the water becomes water gas

7007.489 --> 7012.259999999999
and then when the conditions are right

7010.039 --> 7015.079
it will condense again it will that's

7012.26 --> 7015.89
how clouds form it's like be condenses

7015.079 --> 7019.079
again

7015.89 --> 7019.079000000001
[Music]

7020.949 --> 7031.7699999999995
isn't that just amazing Sean Hawkins

7025.3 --> 7031.77
thinks that water vapor is not a gas

7034.86 --> 7045.58
come on can I get a laugh out of that

7037.27 --> 7051.370000000001

squirting if you know what I mean it's

7096.28 --> 7106.63
just like he didn't deserve that but not

7104.83 --> 7109.87
because he didn't deserve that

7106.63 --> 7114.9400000000005
it's because I didn't deserve that does

7109.87 --> 7118.349999999999

I just got to be careful you know I

7148.569 --> 7157.379000000001
gotta find a way to basically get a half

7153.099 --> 7164.109
way in between Rach win without getting

7157.379 --> 7167.169
just without yeah dragging in lowdown

7164.109 --> 7169.569
curse words it's tough though cuz it is

7167.169 --> 7171.879
in me you know I like I even held back a

7169.569 --> 7176.639
little but I can't get like really Viper

7171.879 --> 7181.78
tongue file like really like it's like I

7176.639 --> 7183.899
wish I kind of didn't have that but it's

7181.78 --> 7187.509999999999
always been there

7183.899 --> 7190.26
like even as a really young kid I could

7187.51 --> 7195.6990000000005
be like really freaking foul-mouthed and

7190.26 --> 7197.859
it's just like why why can I get like

7195.699 --> 7205.259999999999
that I don't like going like it Rick

7197.859 --> 7209.769
makes me feel dirty afterwards anyway

7205.26 --> 7215.379
yeah it is what it is I'm gonna have to

7209.769 --> 7219.55
just set it out and hopefully things

7215.379 --> 7221.979
will just keep on going the cursing is

7219.55 --> 7224.919
unfortunate yes thank you Robin Stanley

7221.979 --> 7226.809
for understanding and like at least I'm

7224.919 --> 7228.669
not doubling down like yeah yeah we

7226.809 --> 7233.019
should have done that yeah

7228.669 --> 7235.809
no but I'm not I'm not gonna turn this

7233.019 --> 7237.639
into an apology to worse conspiracy cats

7235.809 --> 7244.479
because in a way yeah I deserve it it's

7237.639 --> 7247.419
just that I didn't deserve it so anyway

7244.479 --> 7251.8
I am gonna run out to show but you want

7247.419 --> 7254.26
to punch in yeah yes guns have never

7251.8 --> 7256.089
yeah it's especially when when he's just

7254.26 --> 7262.469
like but I'm being polite I'm being

7256.089 --> 7265.269
polite why I'm just like ignoring like

7262.469 --> 7268.569
serious evidence basically lying to

7265.269 --> 7272.399
yourself in plain sight continually that

7268.569 --> 7272.399
really aggravates me too

7274.37 --> 7279.21
yeah Thank You Missouri Bear and he was

7277.23 --> 7281.7
like constantly back and forth in with

7279.21 --> 7283.62
you I think that really had hit the

7281.7 --> 7286.59
wrong snare for me that was really what

7283.62 --> 7290.46
did it it's just that I was addressing

7286.59 --> 7293.28
what he was saying very succinctly like

7290.46 --> 7297.26
really getting into it several times and

7293.28 --> 7297.259999999999
then he tells me oh it didn't hear it

7297.77 --> 7304.620000000001
that's the kind of thing that just gets

7300.09 --> 7307.53
me livid you know really hit me the

7304.62 --> 7312.57
wrong way so I think that's probably why

7307.53 --> 7314.5199999999995
it came to that and I should have

7312.57 --> 7316.5599999999995
probably also corrected my volume but he

7314.52 --> 7318.990000000001
just did what seemed to be completely

7316.56 --> 7321.63
careless about it and I Det really hit

7318.99 --> 7324.2699999999995
me the wrong way anyway I'm running out

7321.63 --> 7328.77
