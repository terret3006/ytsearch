gray

101.2 --> 107.759
and constant

102.88 --> 107.759
thin rain but it's just constant so

108.159 --> 111.2
not pleasant and

109.84 --> 112.159
also

111.2 --> 115.159
kind of

112.159 --> 115.159
cold

116.159 --> 119.60000000000001
so i have my radiator on

122.96 --> 127.759
yeah yeah this this sort of day

125.68 --> 129.84
definitely makes you feel the summer is

127.759 --> 129.84
over

133.84 --> 136.239
right

139.84 --> 146.04
so it is sunday the 3rd of october 2021

146.56 --> 148.959
really

150.4 --> 153.64000000000001

157.36 --> 161.519
and

159.04 --> 164.239
yeah i'll be doing an hour show at least

161.519 --> 164.239
maybe longer

164.48 --> 168.56
i've got a title

166.08 --> 172.16000000000003
i don't necessarily have a

168.56 --> 175.04
very elaborate follow-up on that title

172.16 --> 176.92
it's just a it was a point of interest

175.04 --> 178.07999999999998
also again in reflection to

176.92 --> 180.879
[Music]

178.08 --> 183.20000000000002
owen benjamin's thoughts

180.879 --> 184.39999999999998
from his last stream uh well not his

183.2 --> 187.599
last

184.4 --> 190.48000000000002
his last official bear stream

187.599 --> 192.56
because he also had another

190.48 --> 194.39999999999998
show

192.56 --> 196.879
with another guy i haven't gotten to

194.4 --> 200.0
watching that yet

196.879 --> 202.319
but i will later

200.0 --> 202.319
uh

203.44 --> 206.4
right

204.799 --> 209.87900000000002
i'll get to that as soon as somebody

206.4 --> 209.87900000000002
gets in chat

215.84 --> 221.959
uh martin litka yesterday night flatter

218.72 --> 221.959
day night

234.4 --> 238.959
oh yeah

236.239 --> 241.59900000000002
yeah mark sergeant yeah didn't go live

238.959 --> 245.36
but basically premiered

241.599 --> 245.35999999999999
streaming and got it live

246.64 --> 251.04
i don't know really what to think about

248.319 --> 254.879
it i think yeah it was they were

251.04 --> 257.199
non-flat earthers i think

254.879 --> 259.59999999999997
that we're trying out flat earth and

257.199 --> 262.479
mark sergeant did his thing

259.6 --> 264.16
he's getting very good at it by the way

262.479 --> 266.15999999999997
well he was always kind of good at it

264.16 --> 267.759
but he's getting even better more

266.16 --> 270.47900000000004
focused

267.759 --> 272.16
at least now he was so

270.479 --> 274.71999999999997
that was interesting to see again i

272.16 --> 276.96000000000004
haven't seen him on camera in a long

274.72 --> 276.96000000000004
time

278.32 --> 283.84
hello moonshadow first chat

280.8 --> 283.84000000000003
where is everyone i don't know

286.96 --> 291.12
it is sunday maybe everybody's sleeping

289.6 --> 294.199
in

291.12 --> 294.199
[Music]

295.04 --> 299.6
i would if it was this kind of shitty

297.28 --> 299.59999999999997
weather

301.44 --> 304.84
hello cleary

321.12 --> 324.28000000000003
all right

351.6 --> 353.84000000000003
uh

354.24 --> 356.8
what else

359.199 --> 363.6
yeah i should make a habit of looking

363.84 --> 367.11999999999995
instead of going through the

365.12 --> 370.96
notifications

367.12 --> 376.24
looking through my playlist

370.96 --> 376.23999999999995
because it has a default liked list

376.56 --> 381.84
that way you can actually see what

378.96 --> 381.84
you've been liking

398.319 --> 401.199
um

399.36 --> 402.88
right yeah i've watched quantum of

401.199 --> 405.52000000000004
consciousness

402.88 --> 408.52
squid game analysis for conspiracy

405.52 --> 408.52
theorists

410.639 --> 416.96000000000004
all right and there was this one

413.36 --> 416.96000000000004
very creative video

418.24 --> 423.84000000000003
i think

419.52 --> 423.84
this tenth man that forwarded it

433.039 --> 439.039
it's a funny video

436.16 --> 440.56
basically one guy doing a

439.039 --> 443.36
great sketch

440.56 --> 443.36
with himself

444.639 --> 447.919
i think everybody here would appreciate

446.96 --> 448.71999999999997
it

447.919 --> 452.84
hey

448.72 --> 452.84000000000003
america silver patriots

464.7 --> 467.84999999999997
[Music]

478.4 --> 481.44
right so

482.0 --> 486.4
any

482.879 --> 486.40000000000003
feedback from yesterday

486.639 --> 490.479
you know

488.72 --> 493.03900000000004
i always want to know these things

490.479 --> 494.56
because i don't get to always watch back

493.039 --> 497.84
my shows

494.56 --> 497.84
especially right after

498.72 --> 501.84000000000003
so i just want to know like

502.639 --> 506.24
was it good is there anything you're

504.24 --> 507.199
still thinking about what i was talking

506.24 --> 509.12
about

507.199 --> 511.68
do you have any questions about anything

509.12 --> 511.68
i asked

514.32 --> 521.2
or did you spot any mistakes that you

517.44 --> 523.839
think i might not have caught myself

521.2 --> 526.48
on the live run

523.839 --> 526.48
but yeah

528.08 --> 533.32
only when you feel like it

530.08 --> 533.32
of course

542.09 --> 549.87
[Music]

553.839 --> 560.399
right i'm also spotted a game that i'm

557.04 --> 560.399
gonna try out

560.8 --> 565.1999999999999
pathfinder king maker

564.16 --> 568.48
it's

565.2 --> 570.8000000000001
well pathfinder so it's dnd based

568.48 --> 572.72
from a review i've seen it's very

570.8 --> 575.68
impressive

572.72 --> 577.279
but also difficult to work through and

575.68 --> 580.56
there's probably going to be kind of

577.279 --> 582.399
stupid humor in there as well

580.56 --> 586.0799999999999
but

582.399 --> 588.56
like overall it's super elaborate

586.08 --> 590.64
like with both adventuring and

588.56 --> 592.399
world building

590.64 --> 594.24
so i'm just curious

592.399 --> 596.08
i've never tried this one before well i

594.24 --> 597.92
may have tried in the past but even the

596.08 --> 600.24
reviewer said that in the beginning

597.92 --> 602.0
there were a lot of bugs issues that

600.24 --> 604.72
almost made

602.0 --> 607.6
the entire thing collapse but they have

604.72 --> 608.5600000000001
fixed it since then

607.6 --> 610.5600000000001
so

608.56 --> 613.04
we'll see

610.56 --> 615.5999999999999
we'll see if it's if it's gonna work

613.04 --> 615.5999999999999
hello good

616.839 --> 621.839
servant all right also any feedback on

619.6 --> 626.519
my appearance on jose's i got i did get

621.839 --> 626.519
some feedback from the guys in skype

634.32 --> 638.0790000000001
and it was overall good although they

636.079 --> 640.16
all said like oh i would have said more

638.079 --> 641.92
isn't like i know that's

640.16 --> 642.64
because it's you

641.92 --> 644.959
i

642.64 --> 646.56
it was really impromptu for me so

644.959 --> 648.0
everything i was doing i was doing

646.56 --> 650.399
completely

648.0 --> 654.0
improvised and i didn't really

650.399 --> 654.0
i wasn't really in for that

654.48 --> 659.76
it really was like i'm just gonna

657.04 --> 661.76
kind of do a cameo on jose kind of

659.76 --> 663.519
feeling and i didn't

661.76 --> 666.24
i didn't want to go up against sean

663.519 --> 667.279
hawkins it's so annoying

666.24 --> 669.6
but

667.279 --> 672.32
jose kinda just set me up so i was like

669.6 --> 674.0790000000001
okay what the hell why not

672.32 --> 676.399
but that means i'm going to keep it

674.079 --> 676.399
short

677.839 --> 682.6800000000001
are windy and short that is anyway

689.36 --> 694.36
right also i'm kind of fascinated by my

692.399 --> 696.32
own

694.36 --> 699.04
cosmogenyx

696.32 --> 701.519
exploration of possibilities

699.04 --> 703.279
concerning the inter switching of realm

701.519 --> 706.32
segments

703.279 --> 709.12
that's like the first time i really

706.32 --> 711.519
put it down as a potential possibility

709.12 --> 713.519
in some way

711.519 --> 715.279
never occurred to me before that maybe

713.519 --> 717.44
like indeed like

715.279 --> 719.76
the loop in the looping setting

717.44 --> 722.9590000000001
loop might be cut off the rail might be

719.76 --> 724.56
cut off and then another realm

722.959 --> 728.16
intersects

724.56 --> 728.16
oh no now i remember

728.56 --> 730.88
yeah

729.519 --> 732.399
i

730.88 --> 734.399
originally

732.399 --> 736.48
well i had this title because i wanted

734.399 --> 738.399
to remind myself about it

736.48 --> 742.0790000000001
but at the same time i was conflicted

738.399 --> 744.399
over another title i wanted to choose

742.079 --> 749.3599999999999
because of martin's

744.399 --> 753.04
streams i just got some weird ideas

749.36 --> 754.5600000000001
i feel almost clunky but it's like

753.04 --> 756.8
worth

754.56 --> 758.959
speaking them out on my platform and

756.8 --> 759.8389999999999
that is that

758.959 --> 763.3599999999999
well

759.839 --> 763.36
you know the legends of

764.079 --> 767.4399999999999
weird people

766.0 --> 770.399
fish

767.44 --> 772.32
squid like people or whatever mermaids

770.399 --> 775.04
things coming from the ocean in a

772.32 --> 777.2
certain time period and they are

775.04 --> 779.1999999999999
well you know

777.2 --> 780.1600000000001
there's so much that has come forth from

779.2 --> 782.32
this

780.16 --> 784.16
even in fiction

782.32 --> 787.44
with cthulhu and all that

784.16 --> 790.959
right but

787.44 --> 793.2
i've just thought like okay

790.959 --> 796.3199999999999
where did these things come from

793.2 --> 797.519
relatively all of a sudden

796.32 --> 800.0
because

797.519 --> 802.399
why they were just always there for

800.0 --> 804.959
thousands of years and then they just

802.399 --> 807.68
suddenly decided to show up

804.959 --> 810.7199999999999
when they're pretty

807.68 --> 811.68
well they were said to be overall very

810.72 --> 814.639
like

811.68 --> 815.76
engaging

814.639 --> 817.6
like they're not

815.76 --> 819.8389999999999
creatures that are gonna hide they

817.6 --> 821.44
always like feel like going out and

819.839 --> 823.1990000000001
doing something

821.44 --> 825.839
to the world

823.199 --> 827.68
getting involved spell casting

825.839 --> 829.1990000000001
right

827.68 --> 831.04
well

829.199 --> 832.639
if they weren't always there then where

831.04 --> 836.3199999999999
did they come from

832.639 --> 836.32
has anybody ever considered

836.959 --> 840.4799999999999
okay

838.0 --> 842.88
anybody hey where's your life jacket

840.48 --> 845.9200000000001
yeah it's a good one isn't it

842.88 --> 846.959
it's really worked out like that guy

845.92 --> 850.16
gets it

846.959 --> 851.5999999999999
that guy really really gets it

850.16 --> 856.16
i thought it was a

851.6 --> 857.0400000000001
very well crafted video that guy

856.16 --> 858.399
has

857.04 --> 862.399
some

858.399 --> 864.48
creative and acting skills it's awesome

862.399 --> 867.6
anyway

864.48 --> 867.6
where did they come from

867.68 --> 873.279
the squid and fish people

871.68 --> 877.3599999999999
and i want to ask

873.279 --> 877.36
those that are in chat right now

877.6 --> 885.44
i want to ask them what do you think

881.199 --> 889.199
before i basically spoil it

885.44 --> 889.1990000000001
where did you do you think the

889.44 --> 893.7600000000001
the oceanic people

892.079 --> 896.88
that came out of the ocean where do you

893.76 --> 896.88
think they come came from

897.279 --> 901.32
have you ever thought about it

914.88 --> 919.519
most of the ocean is

916.8 --> 919.519
okay that's

922.959 --> 928.399
all right that's unanswered george

925.12 --> 928.399
sanford welcome by the way

939.68 --> 945.4399999999999
so by that standard george sanford it

941.68 --> 948.6389999999999
would be like okay they were just

945.44 --> 950.24
cut off by the ice wall or something and

948.639 --> 952.24
then

950.24 --> 954.399
there was a breach and then they got

952.24 --> 956.8
through something like that

954.399 --> 956.8
all right

957.6 --> 963.279
it's an idea it's not the idea i had in

959.92 --> 966.4799999999999
mind but keep keep trying

963.279 --> 966.48
hey seeking star wars

967.199 --> 973.0
spinning wool yarn while listening to

969.6 --> 973.0
you all right

982.48 --> 987.44
life forms

984.399 --> 989.68
okay seeking star wars

987.44 --> 989.6800000000001
what

994.16 --> 997.36
all

994.839 --> 999.1990000000001
right so any more

997.36 --> 1001.92
attempts to uh

999.199 --> 1004.7199999999999
figure out where did the fish and squid

1001.92 --> 1008.5999999999999
people come from

1004.72 --> 1008.6
besides the ocean

1036.4 --> 1040.799
is there any evidence of these strange

1038.4 --> 1040.799
squid

1042.24 --> 1047.28
no this is not about oh i'm gonna

1044.48 --> 1049.3600000000001
establish they're real this is about the

1047.28 --> 1050.96
legends and the myths and the sightings

1049.36 --> 1054.4799999999998
and

1050.96 --> 1055.76
whole range of esoterics and secret

1054.48 --> 1059.52
traditions

1055.76 --> 1059.52
you you know what i'm talking about

1059.679 --> 1064.0
come on

1060.64 --> 1064.0
they came from the ocean

1064.08 --> 1070.08
a strange look on them and

1067.679 --> 1071.1200000000001
very bright

1070.08 --> 1074.8799999999999
but

1071.12 --> 1074.8799999999999
alien somehow i don't know

1076.48 --> 1080.48
that's a rough paraphrasing

1078.96 --> 1082.48
i don't even know where

1080.48 --> 1083.76
where the like there should be like

1082.48 --> 1085.76
biblical

1083.76 --> 1088.32
related

1085.76 --> 1090.8799999999999
passages on on their appearance maybe

1088.32 --> 1095.0
it's not biblical maybe it's like the

1090.88 --> 1095.0
if the other books uh

1103.36 --> 1106.32
these legends

1106.72 --> 1112.76
right okay but it's not a question look

1109.28 --> 1112.76
this is a presuppositional

1112.799 --> 1115.84
argument

1114.16 --> 1119.6000000000001
this is a question

1115.84 --> 1122.6399999999999
assuming that they existed

1119.6 --> 1126.28
and that they suddenly showed up where

1122.64 --> 1126.2800000000002
did they come from

1129.67 --> 1137.95
[Music]

1143.6 --> 1146.6
right

1171.76 --> 1176.6
never know what's on the menu here

1178.08 --> 1181.6789999999999
just like to call them squid people

1182.0 --> 1186.24
i don't know and now there's the siri

1184.0 --> 1189.039
squid

1186.24 --> 1191.1200000000001
squid game

1189.039 --> 1193.36
it's not even because of that it's just

1191.12 --> 1196.0
that it's just

1193.36 --> 1197.6
pointing at the myths of

1196.0 --> 1200.799
tulu

1197.6 --> 1200.799
and where that came from

1201.6 --> 1206.559
and

1203.2 --> 1208.799
like the fish miter

1206.559 --> 1211.28
fish hats from pope

1208.799 --> 1212.48
look there are so many pointers of this

1211.28 --> 1214.1589999999999
out there

1212.48 --> 1218.08
so where

1214.159 --> 1221.8400000000001
did they suddenly come from

1218.08 --> 1221.84
that's my question right now

1223.2 --> 1227.6000000000001
no it's not radioactivity no it's

1225.2 --> 1232.28
completely different no

1227.6 --> 1232.28
that's hilarious by the way but no

1238.4 --> 1242.799
now i just

1240.32 --> 1245.2
because of that input just kind of like

1242.799 --> 1249.52
force cross read that and see like if

1245.2 --> 1251.679
there is actually a possibility but yeah

1249.52 --> 1254.72
let's just

1251.679 --> 1256.96
stick to the direct question

1254.72 --> 1258.88
where did the

1256.96 --> 1261.039
people that came out of the ocean come

1258.88 --> 1265.5590000000002
from

1261.039 --> 1265.559
why did they suddenly show up

1287.76 --> 1293.679
okay well where did the shape shifters

1290.88 --> 1297.6000000000001
from the oceans suddenly come from okay

1293.679 --> 1300.96
it doesn't change the question ian dale

1297.6 --> 1300.9599999999998
it doesn't matter what they are

1301.52 --> 1305.84
where did they come from out of the

1303.52 --> 1305.84
ocean

1308.88 --> 1313.2800000000002
and why did they suddenly show up come

1310.72 --> 1317.039
on guys come on

1313.28 --> 1317.039
for crying out loud

1317.2 --> 1323.3600000000001
brains use your [ __ ] brains i

1320.96 --> 1325.8400000000001
beg you

1323.36 --> 1328.4799999999998
don't make me just throw pearls before

1325.84 --> 1330.8799999999999
swines proof you actually have an

1328.48 --> 1334.32
inkling

1330.88 --> 1337.3200000000002
an idea here outer space get to shut up

1334.32 --> 1337.32
dude

1357.52 --> 1360.52
uh

1371.36 --> 1375.32
i give up wow

1381.679 --> 1387.039
where did the people that mythologically

1384.799 --> 1389.52
came from the ocean

1387.039 --> 1391.12
originally come from and why did they

1389.52 --> 1393.28
suddenly show up

1391.12 --> 1398.12
that's the question

1393.28 --> 1398.12
oh my god guys come on

1403.919 --> 1409.76
it's such a basic question

1407.679 --> 1412.0
how can you not

1409.76 --> 1413.12
see it right away

1412.0 --> 1414.08
right

1413.12 --> 1415.84
i know

1414.08 --> 1419.12
nobody's probably ever asked that

1415.84 --> 1421.12
question in your conscious presence

1419.12 --> 1424.0
like why would people

1421.12 --> 1426.08
you know well i do

1424.0 --> 1428.159
where did they suddenly come from why

1426.08 --> 1431.12
did they come out of the ocean

1428.159 --> 1432.96
why did they come out of the ocean why

1431.12 --> 1434.559
didn't they why did they suddenly show

1432.96 --> 1436.559
up come on

1434.559 --> 1438.799
no not far

1436.559 --> 1438.799
oh

1439.6 --> 1442.8799999999999
fallen angels

1443.2 --> 1447.279
it's a weird way of putting it

1446.08 --> 1449.9189999999999
i

1447.279 --> 1452.48
but that doesn't prove that you actually

1449.919 --> 1452.48
understand

1456.48 --> 1461.1200000000001
you'll figure it out later once somebody

1459.2 --> 1464.0
finally gives me the right answer come

1461.12 --> 1465.36
on stone monkey 3d steamy traveler good

1464.0 --> 1468.08
servant

1465.36 --> 1470.6399999999999
seeking star wars

1468.08 --> 1473.36
george sanford come on

1470.64 --> 1477.1200000000001
moon shadow you can do this can you just

1473.36 --> 1477.12
freaking answer the question

1477.84 --> 1481.1999999999998
how difficult is this

1483.2 --> 1488.159
mermaids yeah mermaids are part of the

1485.44 --> 1490.64
people that suddenly came out of the

1488.159 --> 1490.64
ocean

1490.96 --> 1495.279
part of

1492.64 --> 1498.48
the same mythological route

1495.279 --> 1501.84
so where did they come from

1498.48 --> 1501.84
out of the ocean

1504.04 --> 1511.109
[Music]

1534.4 --> 1537.76
no

1536.08 --> 1543.08
not atlantis

1537.76 --> 1543.08
atlantis is on earth it's in our realm

1544.32 --> 1549.4399999999998
they came from atlantis then that means

1546.24 --> 1549.44
they were always here

1554.559 --> 1561.24
that doesn't explain why they

1556.4 --> 1561.24
suddenly start showing up

1588.4 --> 1597.1200000000001
okay i am so severely disappointed

1593.2 --> 1599.8400000000001
in all of you i'm just not gonna say it

1597.12 --> 1599.84
how about that

1602.4 --> 1606.5590000000002
i can't believe it i can't believe

1607.12 --> 1612.12
just goofing around like a bunch of

1609.12 --> 1612.12
drunks

1621.679 --> 1624.679
uh

1643.679 --> 1648.3200000000002
right

1644.88 --> 1648.3200000000002
so let's move on then

1649.44 --> 1655.8400000000001
right secret about radioactivity world

1652.559 --> 1655.84
could never handle

1661.2 --> 1664.32
what do you think that is

1666.88 --> 1673.6000000000001
right besides that hey

1670.64 --> 1673.6000000000001
nukes aren't real

1674.24 --> 1681.44
that much we've established

1677.12 --> 1681.4399999999998
science behind it is science fiction

1681.52 --> 1685.52
clear signs of fakery doesn't mean

1683.6 --> 1688.559
there's not big bombs but

1685.52 --> 1690.559
like not like that

1688.559 --> 1693.2
but there's other weird stuff about it

1690.559 --> 1695.6789999999999
too right we know this

1693.2 --> 1697.919
one nuclear physicist basically on

1695.679 --> 1699.52
camera just showed that it's harmless

1697.919 --> 1702.5590000000002
that you can even eat it and he's done

1699.52 --> 1702.559
it multiple times

1706.399 --> 1712.1589999999999
right but at the same time there are

1708.88 --> 1714.24
people that do get issues from

1712.159 --> 1717.2
radioactivity

1714.24 --> 1720.08
right it can be harmful at the same time

1717.2 --> 1723.52
it's complicated like that like some

1720.08 --> 1725.9189999999999
type of radioactivity are harmful

1723.52 --> 1727.9189999999999
and others

1725.919 --> 1728.96
well not necessarily

1727.919 --> 1730.72
so

1728.96 --> 1733.039
did you know for example that apparently

1730.72 --> 1734.72
i always keep forgetting this benjamin

1733.039 --> 1736.48
reminded me about it

1734.72 --> 1739.2
porcelain

1736.48 --> 1740.64
apparently is also radioactive so much

1739.2 --> 1742.96
so that

1740.64 --> 1744.72
when checked for radioactivity

1742.96 --> 1746.64
in transport

1744.72 --> 1749.6000000000001
shipments of porcelain

1746.64 --> 1751.679
are actually halted because it might be

1749.6 --> 1753.6789999999999
uranium right serious that that

1751.679 --> 1754.3990000000001
apparently happens

1753.679 --> 1756.3200000000002
so

1754.399 --> 1759.52
there's radioactivity in that it's just

1756.32 --> 1761.84
common stuff and yeah

1759.52 --> 1765.36
it unnerved own benjamin to think that

1761.84 --> 1768.24
oh porcelain fillings oh my god

1765.36 --> 1768.24
radioactivity

1769.039 --> 1774.1589999999999
so

1769.919 --> 1776.0
what is this bizarre secret

1774.159 --> 1779.3600000000001
of radioactivity

1776.0 --> 1780.64
it's distinctly there it does stuff

1779.36 --> 1783.36
why does it

1780.64 --> 1786.5590000000002
why do some people

1783.36 --> 1789.9189999999999
get sick and die from it and others

1786.559 --> 1792.399
seem unaffected

1789.919 --> 1795.3600000000001
the paint on the porcelain i've i don't

1792.399 --> 1797.039
know microwork this is just secondhand

1795.36 --> 1799.4399999999998
information

1797.039 --> 1801.12
i didn't go look up porcelain and all

1799.44 --> 1803.44
that

1801.12 --> 1807.32
i'm just trusting sources it's not the

1803.44 --> 1807.3200000000002
first time i've heard that

1815.76 --> 1820.24
are nuclear power plants real yes they

1818.08 --> 1820.24
are

1820.48 --> 1823.84
and i think that

1824.32 --> 1829.039
the dangers of them

1827.279 --> 1830.96
are

1829.039 --> 1833.52
yeah science fiction i think they're

1830.96 --> 1835.76
extremely safe actually

1833.52 --> 1838.32
although yeah if

1835.76 --> 1840.1589999999999
things really seriously break down

1838.32 --> 1842.399
especially with the older models there

1840.159 --> 1846.159
can be problems with hydrogen gas

1842.399 --> 1846.1589999999999
starting to form and that can explode

1846.399 --> 1849.36
but other than that

1849.679 --> 1854.3990000000001
i think they're probably in reality

1851.52 --> 1856.799
extremely safe

1854.399 --> 1856.799
anyway

1860.72 --> 1865.6000000000001
right so

1862.799 --> 1868.6399999999999
a consideration that i've had reflecting

1865.6 --> 1872.48
upon many other stories including like

1868.64 --> 1872.48
even the idea of the ark of the covenant

1874.08 --> 1878.559
descriptions of interactions with it and

1876.48 --> 1881.0
myths

1878.559 --> 1883.6789999999999
that maybe

1881.0 --> 1886.88
radioactivity is like something weird

1883.679 --> 1888.159
it's a weird thing that happens

1886.88 --> 1891.0390000000002
and

1888.159 --> 1891.0390000000002
it kind of like

1891.279 --> 1897.519
taps into your frequency

1894.24 --> 1899.2
it has a radioactivity is like energy

1897.519 --> 1901.84
well we are

1899.2 --> 1904.0800000000002
in our own right energy

1901.84 --> 1908.08
and we have a frequency and we do things

1904.08 --> 1911.6
with that well what if radioactivity

1908.08 --> 1914.1589999999999
is like something that

1911.6 --> 1916.799
enhances

1914.159 --> 1916.7990000000002
aspects

1917.36 --> 1922.799
energy aspects but that also brings the

1919.6 --> 1926.0
danger that i think this is

1922.799 --> 1928.559
at this point pure superstition

1926.0 --> 1930.88
but i've had some bizarre experiences in

1928.559 --> 1933.279
the past that a dark world vision

1930.88 --> 1936.0
related it it's very confusing to me

1933.279 --> 1937.76
still but i've said i've laid this out

1936.0 --> 1940.399
down before it's just something that

1937.76 --> 1942.64
returned to mind again

1940.399 --> 1945.12
like this down like years ago

1942.64 --> 1947.2
that what if radioactivity

1945.12 --> 1948.799
like if your

1947.2 --> 1950.0800000000002
spirit

1948.799 --> 1951.279
is

1950.08 --> 1954.0
earthly

1951.279 --> 1958.88
and broken and full of lies

1954.0 --> 1962.08
that that radioactivity actually

1958.88 --> 1964.72
causes the entropy that comes from

1962.08 --> 1967.1999999999998
wearing sins enhances

1964.72 --> 1970.799
so that radioactivity basically enhance

1967.2 --> 1970.799
the punishment for sin

1973.039 --> 1976.84
isn't that just interesting

1980.88 --> 1985.679
right so that's

1983.519 --> 1987.44
basically the title of the show greatest

1985.679 --> 1990.0800000000002
secret about radioactivity the world

1987.44 --> 1993.519
could never handle

1990.08 --> 1993.519
because the world is full of sin

1993.84 --> 1996.08
right

2002.559 --> 2006.72
what is the value of human frequency

2005.44 --> 2007.76
kilohertz

2006.72 --> 2010.08
dude

2007.76 --> 2011.84
it's a description

2010.08 --> 2013.9189999999999
like this is all

2011.84 --> 2015.84
metaphysics

2013.919 --> 2019.8400000000001
this has to do with consciousness and

2015.84 --> 2019.84
the spirit energy and all that

2029.12 --> 2032.7199999999998
in a weird way and this even reflects

2031.84 --> 2035.9189999999999
back

2032.72 --> 2035.919
to like getting

2036.64 --> 2040.48
scanned

2038.08 --> 2043.039
by machinery using radioactivity it's

2040.48 --> 2045.44
like i've always been sub like

2043.039 --> 2048.32
subconsciously very aware

2045.44 --> 2050.0
and wary of the dangers of radioactivity

2048.32 --> 2052.56
but always

2050.0 --> 2052.56
had like a

2052.8 --> 2056.8
an inner response that had nothing to do

2055.599 --> 2059.119
with

2056.8 --> 2063.76
what i've been told about it

2059.119 --> 2067.119
and that is if you face it be pure

2063.76 --> 2069.5200000000004
because it's like facing god

2067.119 --> 2071.679
like not literally not saying that

2069.52 --> 2072.839
radioactivity is god

2071.679 --> 2075.679
but it's

2072.839 --> 2078.48
like if you're like

2075.679 --> 2080.639
foolish delusional or like all gravel

2078.48 --> 2081.679
inside when you face it then you might

2080.639 --> 2083.839
pay

2081.679 --> 2084.96
and that's like

2083.839 --> 2088.44
yeah

2084.96 --> 2088.44
from the inside

2094.32 --> 2100.1600000000003
radioactivity has like implications on

2097.2 --> 2100.16
the consciousness

2101.68 --> 2107.1189999999997
it doesn't directly alter it but what

2103.839 --> 2107.119
your consciousness does

2109.839 --> 2112.72
like

2110.72 --> 2115.7599999999998
matters almost more

2112.72 --> 2115.7599999999998
the purity of it

2115.92 --> 2120.8
in the face of radioactivity that's kind

2118.32 --> 2123.28
of like a superstition belief that

2120.8 --> 2126.2400000000002
really boiled up on the inside at

2123.28 --> 2127.44
extremely young age

2126.24 --> 2128.3999999999996
and

2127.44 --> 2130.96
it just

2128.4 --> 2133.359
it stays there and i see the

2130.96 --> 2135.2
the correlatory connections with other

2133.359 --> 2137.5989999999997
stories

2135.2 --> 2141.2799999999997
like the arc of the covenant

2137.599 --> 2141.28
to be pure when facing it it's

2141.52 --> 2145.52
and the suspicion that it might be some

2143.839 --> 2149.2
kind of a power source and maybe

2145.52 --> 2151.04
radioactivity is involved etc etc and

2149.2 --> 2154.48
yeah

2151.04 --> 2156.8
so maybe my superstitious

2154.48 --> 2158.72
belief is actually true

2156.8 --> 2162.2400000000002
would explain also why

2158.72 --> 2162.24
the nuclear physicist guy

2163.76 --> 2167.2000000000003
was completely unharmed

2167.359 --> 2171.5989999999997
by the radioactivity of these substances

2169.28 --> 2174.4
that he consumed because he was pure he

2171.599 --> 2176.4
was totally dedicated to prove willing

2174.4 --> 2179.119
to risk

2176.4 --> 2179.119
to do that

2179.2 --> 2184.359
and that protected him

2181.2 --> 2184.359
you see

2186.16 --> 2191.68
so this is this is getting almost like

2189.04 --> 2191.68
mystical

2192.8 --> 2196.6400000000003
but yeah

2193.92 --> 2198.079
that's how i kind of deal with it

2196.64 --> 2201.2
i don't know

2198.079 --> 2204.1600000000003
if that if it's literally true

2201.2 --> 2205.5989999999997
if this is like a an arwanian too soon

2204.16 --> 2207.44
thing

2205.599 --> 2209.119
and and maybe there's a whole range of

2207.44 --> 2211.359
people that have come to these same

2209.119 --> 2213.599
conclusions about it

2211.359 --> 2215.44
and they're just kind of also

2213.599 --> 2219.28
keeping it to themselves sometimes

2215.44 --> 2219.28
mentioning it i don't even know for sure

2219.359 --> 2224.0
i think there might have been some

2221.28 --> 2225.2000000000003
people out there that have

2224.0 --> 2229.48
casually

2225.2 --> 2229.48
dropped the idea here and there

2231.2 --> 2235.04
hello getting wisdom by the way

2237.839 --> 2241.16
dutch sailor

2246.0 --> 2249.0
uh

2256.2 --> 2263.1589999999997
[Music]

2275.44 --> 2280.48
right

2276.32 --> 2280.48
it's it comes down to you have to be

2282.32 --> 2286.32
with logos you have to do it right

2284.72 --> 2289.1189999999997
when you're exposed

2286.32 --> 2291.2000000000003
that would be my personal superstition

2289.119 --> 2292.8
based advice that i think is very

2291.2 --> 2294.96
reliable

2292.8 --> 2297.76
it might carry you incredible way also

2294.96 --> 2301.28
because if you truly believe it then if

2297.76 --> 2301.28
something insane happens

2303.04 --> 2307.92
in the face of something radioactivity

2305.359 --> 2310.0789999999997
related you don't immediately panic

2307.92 --> 2310.96
yourself to doom because that is also a

2310.079 --> 2313.44
sin

2310.96 --> 2315.04
right that would might actually be like

2313.44 --> 2316.8
a placebo

2315.04 --> 2319.119
kill effect

2316.8 --> 2319.119
could

2323.04 --> 2329.52
if you just stay focused basically sit

2326.24 --> 2329.52
it through then maybe

2329.68 --> 2334.24
maybe the damage can be

2331.839 --> 2335.7599999999998
limited or even negated

2334.24 --> 2338.8799999999997
it depends i don't know if you're

2335.76 --> 2342.1600000000003
literally like drowning in this stuff

2338.88 --> 2344.079
your entire body becomes saturated with

2342.16 --> 2346.0789999999997
that action you'll just get poison

2344.079 --> 2349.28
whatever i don't know it doesn't

2346.079 --> 2352.0
there's always going to be limits

2349.28 --> 2352.0
i'm just saying

2353.44 --> 2358.0
right

2354.48 --> 2361.44
so anybody here gaining wisdom

2358.0 --> 2361.44
did you just arrive

2363.599 --> 2370.56
because earlier i put a question in chat

2366.48 --> 2370.56
and nobody was able to guess it

2373.2 --> 2376.96
i'm still disappointed about that

2379.28 --> 2385.0400000000004
are radioactive dirty bombs real

2382.8 --> 2385.04
well

2385.359 --> 2387.44
look

2386.24 --> 2390.9599999999996
there are so

2387.44 --> 2393.04
well radioactive substances where

2390.96 --> 2396.0
it's not even the radioactivity

2393.04 --> 2398.72
necessarily it's just the substance

2396.0 --> 2400.96
itself is poisonous like for example

2398.72 --> 2403.7599999999998
plutonium

2400.96 --> 2406.4
is very poisonous

2403.76 --> 2406.4
apparently

2409.68 --> 2414.3999999999996
i don't get close to that

2411.839 --> 2417.52
as far as i know who

2414.4 --> 2421.119
like that is poisonous in itself so it's

2417.52 --> 2424.119
rather just like a poison bomb then

2421.119 --> 2424.119
see

2428.319 --> 2432.4
so yeah

2430.24 --> 2433.9199999999996
dirty bombs are still they're just

2432.4 --> 2438.2000000000003
they're still dirty they're still

2433.92 --> 2438.2000000000003
freaking poison bombs

2438.96 --> 2441.2
but

2443.359 --> 2445.68
like

2448.24 --> 2453.2799999999997
if there were dirty bombs i think the

2450.64 --> 2456.24
primary objective would be to scare

2453.28 --> 2457.6800000000003
people away first and foremost

2456.24 --> 2460.16
poison some

2457.68 --> 2462.56
and then people would just over the myth

2460.16 --> 2464.3999999999996
of radioactivity like or

2462.56 --> 2466.24
because they live very sinful lives and

2464.4 --> 2468.4
then their instinct tells them to stay

2466.24 --> 2473.0789999999997
away

2468.4 --> 2473.079
that it's really to scare people off

2483.2 --> 2488.24
okay so gaining wisdom i'll ask the

2485.68 --> 2490.96
question again i asked earlier

2488.24 --> 2490.9599999999996
this hangout

2491.92 --> 2496.079
it was about

2493.28 --> 2499.44
the fish and squid people as i call them

2496.079 --> 2503.3590000000004
the ones coming out of the ocean

2499.44 --> 2503.359
lots of myths referred to them

2503.44 --> 2508.0
right

2504.72 --> 2511.359
and suddenly they came out of the ocean

2508.0 --> 2514.319
they had weird garments and

2511.359 --> 2516.64
ways of doing things and they

2514.319 --> 2518.48
technology

2516.64 --> 2521.52
and it started to get

2518.48 --> 2523.92
meddlesome with the people

2521.52 --> 2525.04
and they were dark like dark hearted

2523.92 --> 2529.359
whatever

2525.04 --> 2531.44
right there's many myths around that so

2529.359 --> 2533.44
where did well i'm just gonna call them

2531.44 --> 2536.64
the squid and fish people where did the

2533.44 --> 2538.48
squid and fish people come from

2536.64 --> 2541.1189999999997
out of the ocean

2538.48 --> 2543.52
and why did they suddenly

2541.119 --> 2546.319
show up

2543.52 --> 2547.68
that was the question and i got several

2546.319 --> 2550.72
attempts

2547.68 --> 2554.0789999999997
like well maybe just one attempt

2550.72 --> 2555.9199999999996
atlantis and i said no that's atlantis

2554.079 --> 2558.0
is in our realm

2555.92 --> 2560.16
that makes no sense why they then would

2558.0 --> 2562.56
suddenly start to show up out of the

2560.16 --> 2562.56
ocean

2562.88 --> 2567.2000000000003
although yeah

2564.96 --> 2569.599
like maybe they were the inhabitants of

2567.2 --> 2571.68
atlantis and it sank and then they just

2569.599 --> 2573.52
like okay let's migrate to the coast and

2571.68 --> 2575.359
then they suddenly showed up

2573.52 --> 2578.319
it's not that bad a train of thought but

2575.359 --> 2580.319
then why the hell would have there been

2578.319 --> 2583.68
squid and

2580.319 --> 2585.7599999999998
fish people like on land atlantis was

2583.68 --> 2588.48
above the ground

2585.76 --> 2590.8
like oh really they were just there

2588.48 --> 2592.88
nobody really talked about them and then

2590.8 --> 2594.48
suddenly they made a mighty impression

2592.88 --> 2596.8
as they showed up out of the ocean that

2594.48 --> 2601.48
doesn't make logical sense to me

2596.8 --> 2601.48
there is another option though

2606.319 --> 2610.48
okay steamy trip would innocent young

2608.4 --> 2612.1600000000003
children be immune to radioactivity

2610.48 --> 2614.4
since danger

2612.16 --> 2614.3999999999996
no

2616.4 --> 2620.319
no they

2617.92 --> 2621.6800000000003
it depends

2620.319 --> 2623.92
you see

2621.68 --> 2626.72
a kid is still

2623.92 --> 2629.359
struggling with the earthly so a kid can

2626.72 --> 2629.359
get afraid

2631.839 --> 2637.2
now if they have an extraordinary talent

2634.48 --> 2639.76
to not be afraid and to be very focused

2637.2 --> 2642.16
on that and perfect at it then maybe

2639.76 --> 2646.2400000000002
they'd be good

2642.16 --> 2649.5989999999997
but no children are not immune to sin

2646.24 --> 2651.839
what about babies i don't know

2649.599 --> 2653.3590000000004
what why would you do that what are

2651.839 --> 2655.359
babies gonna do

2653.359 --> 2659.119
why why would they have to be confronted

2655.359 --> 2661.04
with the radioactivity i don't get that

2659.119 --> 2663.839
they're physically incapable of doing

2661.04 --> 2663.839
things

2665.839 --> 2671.359
not if we're all born sinners

2668.96 --> 2673.04
no we're not born a sinner it's just

2671.359 --> 2676.72
that

2673.04 --> 2680.48
dealing with sin is what life is about

2676.72 --> 2680.48
and it starts pretty young

2681.359 --> 2685.68
so you're going to be facing and like

2683.76 --> 2687.2000000000003
yeah you don't always make the right

2685.68 --> 2689.359
choice

2687.2 --> 2691.359
sometimes kids do get like really

2689.359 --> 2693.7599999999998
panicked or something right they get

2691.359 --> 2696.4
really afraid or really

2693.76 --> 2698.88
they don't know what yeah it's

2696.4 --> 2699.6800000000003
it's not what i was talking about it's

2698.88 --> 2703.52
not

2699.68 --> 2705.9199999999996
like oh priestly sin official things no

2703.52 --> 2708.4
no this is about the mechanics of the

2705.92 --> 2708.4
spirit

2709.76 --> 2713.6800000000003
and if you're susceptible to fear

2714.079 --> 2718.6800000000003
then i don't think you're immune to

2715.68 --> 2718.68
radioactivity

2724.4 --> 2731.2400000000002
and the younger you are the easier

2727.2 --> 2731.24
you're spooked so

2743.76 --> 2748.5600000000004
so gaining wisdom any

2745.839 --> 2748.56
any answer

2749.599 --> 2754.079
on my question concerning the fish and

2751.52 --> 2756.079
squid people which is

2754.079 --> 2758.6400000000003
like a reference to a myth is not a

2756.079 --> 2761.76
metaphorical thing relating to people in

2758.64 --> 2765.04
this world right now at all

2761.76 --> 2767.8390000000004
this is about the past

2765.04 --> 2770.079
and mythology mythological figures said

2767.839 --> 2772.319
to be have coming out of the ocean all

2770.079 --> 2774.1600000000003
of a sudden where did they come from why

2772.319 --> 2776.56
did they show up suddenly that's the

2774.16 --> 2779.2799999999997
question

2776.56 --> 2780.88
atlantis was my second guess yeah but

2779.28 --> 2782.2400000000002
it that's not

2780.88 --> 2785.28
the idea

2782.24 --> 2787.1189999999997
that's not the right answer in this case

2785.28 --> 2789.3590000000004
because that wouldn't yeah why would

2787.119 --> 2790.8
they certainly then show up and nobody

2789.359 --> 2795.0
ever heard of them

2790.8 --> 2795.0
if they were always there

2807.76 --> 2812.2400000000002
it's kind of a

2810.079 --> 2814.8
decent answer though in retrospect like

2812.24 --> 2816.9599999999996
yeah maybe if atlantis is set to sink

2814.8 --> 2818.319
subtly

2816.96 --> 2820.48
and that could be a reason why they

2818.319 --> 2822.0
suddenly showed up right after atlantis

2820.48 --> 2826.56
but

2822.0 --> 2830.839
that's not the thought i had in mind

2826.56 --> 2830.839
as to where they're coming from

2834.31 --> 2842.33
[Music]

2843.839 --> 2846.16
all right i'm gonna take two minute

2845.359 --> 2848.319
break

2846.16 --> 2852.92
be right back hope somebody

2848.319 --> 2852.92
figures it out when i'm back

2954.4 --> 2958.079
alright steamy traveler that's

2958.8 --> 2961.8390000000004
that's close

2960.8 --> 2965.04
that's

2961.839 --> 2965.04
that's another approach

2965.28 --> 2968.8390000000004
it's getting close

2972.559 --> 2974.96
i'm just

2975.359 --> 2979.04
you know there

2977.76 --> 2982.079
there's this

2979.04 --> 2984.16
thing out there you know where

2982.079 --> 2986.0
supposedly all civilizations have

2984.16 --> 2988.64
references to

2986.0 --> 2991.119
certain type of event

2988.64 --> 2993.52
that happened involving a certain

2991.119 --> 2998.0
substance

2993.52 --> 3000.16
that was suddenly present in abundance

2998.0 --> 3004.599
maybe

3000.16 --> 3004.5989999999997
maybe that's good enough a hint

3013.119 --> 3016.319
flood

3013.84 --> 3017.44
[Music]

3016.319 --> 3019.599
all right

3017.44 --> 3020.88
so yeah what is the flood right

3019.599 --> 3023.3590000000004
suddenly

3020.88 --> 3025.76
huge amount of water

3023.359 --> 3028.0789999999997
huge amounts of

3025.76 --> 3031.76
where did it come from

3028.079 --> 3034.319
it rained down didn't it

3031.76 --> 3036.7200000000003
a never-ending super storm

3034.319 --> 3038.8
like literally buckets and buckets it's

3036.72 --> 3040.48
not even rain anymore it might have

3038.8 --> 3042.96
started like that but it's just like

3040.48 --> 3044.48
water coming down so fast everything

3042.96 --> 3047.44
just rose

3044.48 --> 3047.44
extremely quick

3048.64 --> 3055.2799999999997
so

3050.8 --> 3058.0
what if that event was actually a gate

3055.28 --> 3060.0
it's even said to be so a gate having

3058.0 --> 3061.2
opened in the heavens

3060.0 --> 3062.16
right

3061.2 --> 3063.9199999999996
above

3062.16 --> 3066.96
a gate

3063.92 --> 3070.64
a gate to what

3066.96 --> 3071.599
could it have been a gate to a water

3070.64 --> 3074.7999999999997
realm

3071.599 --> 3075.839
layer above right

3074.8 --> 3077.44
but

3075.839 --> 3079.2
like

3077.44 --> 3080.319
a realm that is

3079.2 --> 3084.64
basically

3080.319 --> 3087.04
it doesn't directly physically connect

3084.64 --> 3089.1189999999997
to ours it's not like oh the thing that

3087.04 --> 3092.16
is above the firmament

3089.119 --> 3094.0
right maybe it was a loop gate that

3092.16 --> 3094.96
actually opened

3094.0 --> 3096.64
and

3094.96 --> 3099.52
almost then

3096.64 --> 3102.48
micro realm make it maybe a bigger realm

3099.52 --> 3107.119
maybe another

3102.48 --> 3107.119
layer of loops above us another track

3107.28 --> 3113.28
open up and just

3109.52 --> 3117.24
a giant amount of ocean water

3113.28 --> 3117.2400000000002
and its inhabitants

3118.72 --> 3125.04
came pouring down

3121.839 --> 3126.48
and like what the [ __ ] just a bunch of

3125.04 --> 3128.16
squid and

3126.48 --> 3131.92
fish people

3128.16 --> 3134.72
living happily in their own watery world

3131.92 --> 3134.7200000000003
and suddenly

3135.359 --> 3138.64
they're the masters of their little

3136.88 --> 3140.8
realm and suddenly they all get

3138.64 --> 3143.839
deposited

3140.8 --> 3146.7200000000003
their entire realm is just emptied

3143.839 --> 3146.72
into ours

3149.359 --> 3153.5589999999997
have you ever thought about that

3159.28 --> 3164.6400000000003
haley's comet might be a gateway now

3162.0 --> 3168.319
it's a light

3164.64 --> 3168.319
but maybe there are correlations

3175.76 --> 3180.6800000000003
so

3176.559 --> 3180.6800000000003
are you getting the picture now

3195.44 --> 3200.559
right if there's gonna be certainly be

3197.68 --> 3202.96
huge amount of water

3200.559 --> 3205.96
well maybe there were things in the

3202.96 --> 3205.96
water

3211.119 --> 3214.8
you're here they came from the north

3216.24 --> 3219.24
hmm

3232.64 --> 3236.16
well if they came literally from the

3234.48 --> 3237.2
north that would be a different setup

3236.16 --> 3240.3999999999996
than

3237.2 --> 3243.04
who knows maybe they were in a this is

3240.4 --> 3245.04
another possibility and it is more about

3243.04 --> 3247.599
oh in a loop beyond right maybe they

3245.04 --> 3249.119
were in their own separated realm

3247.599 --> 3250.48
segment

3249.119 --> 3252.48
in the far

3250.48 --> 3255.119
the in a far distant loop connection

3252.48 --> 3257.68
maybe several realms away

3255.119 --> 3260.7200000000003
that in a very unique opportunity all

3257.68 --> 3260.72
suddenly opened up

3261.92 --> 3266.16
and it was like the first time they ever

3263.76 --> 3269.599
had the opportunity to directly go here

3266.16 --> 3269.5989999999997
and they just get went for it

3270.96 --> 3275.2
could also be

3273.119 --> 3276.88
right and now i just i thought about oh

3275.2 --> 3280.16
what if

3276.88 --> 3282.799
yeah if the flood water

3280.16 --> 3285.44
would have not come from above but from

3282.799 --> 3287.68
another realm segment suddenly opening

3285.44 --> 3290.96
then it would be like the biggest tidal

3287.68 --> 3295.64
wave the world had ever seen

3290.96 --> 3295.64
that would be much more dramatic i think

3300.079 --> 3303.2400000000002
all right

3327.28 --> 3332.4
right so yeah that was it that was my

3330.16 --> 3332.3999999999996
thought

3333.2 --> 3335.839
ah

3337.359 --> 3340.72
those were the two ideas

3343.359 --> 3349.839
fish and squid people coming down

3346.48 --> 3349.839
with the flood waters

3350.0 --> 3354.559
and then after it all went down they

3351.76 --> 3354.559
were like hey

3356.319 --> 3361.359
where did all the water go and then

3358.48 --> 3365.44
they're like okay well

3361.359 --> 3365.44
let's check out what's on land then

3368.72 --> 3372.0
right it was just a thought

3372.72 --> 3376.799
i'm always interested like if yeah the

3374.64 --> 3378.72
flood look where did all that water come

3376.799 --> 3381.2
from it had to come from somewhere who's

3378.72 --> 3384.3999999999996
to say that that somewhere is just a

3381.2 --> 3388.2
void with only water

3384.4 --> 3388.2000000000003
how would you know that

3396.319 --> 3404.04
squidward

3398.799 --> 3404.04
oh god everybody's in the gutter

3409.03 --> 3412.409
[Music]

3426.0 --> 3429.0
so

3433.68 --> 3437.44
right and and the interesting thing is

3435.839 --> 3439.52
also

3437.44 --> 3442.64
is that

3439.52 --> 3444.559
well if they did actually fall down with

3442.64 --> 3447.44
the flood

3444.559 --> 3448.6400000000003
then technically you could consider them

3447.44 --> 3451.2000000000003
fallen

3448.64 --> 3452.8799999999997
they fell from above into the realm

3451.2 --> 3454.96
punch

3452.88 --> 3458.799
with the giant bucket of water be their

3454.96 --> 3458.799
entire realm being emptied maybe

3461.119 --> 3464.2400000000002
and they were

3462.64 --> 3466.48
apparently very

3464.24 --> 3468.799
powerful

3466.48 --> 3471.04
so i bet they all

3468.799 --> 3475.24
were seen like angels first like

3471.04 --> 3475.24
mystical bizarre creatures

3475.68 --> 3479.9199999999996
and they fell i

3477.28 --> 3481.119
i'm getting really oversimplified here i

3479.92 --> 3483.04
think

3481.119 --> 3486.079
it's just

3483.04 --> 3487.7599999999998
yeah maybe that happened

3486.079 --> 3490.4
just trying to figure out everything

3487.76 --> 3493.5200000000004
that's really happened out there

3490.4 --> 3495.359
what could have happened how

3493.52 --> 3498.52
how that would work mechanically with

3495.359 --> 3498.52
the realm

3512.4 --> 3516.4
i guess that this type of thinking does

3514.64 --> 3518.64
sort of in its own way give a bit of a

3516.4 --> 3521.44
maze runner kind of feeling

3518.64 --> 3524.16
like yeah the environment

3521.44 --> 3526.64
could like a clock change like the very

3524.16 --> 3529.04
space available could just be according

3526.64 --> 3531.44
to certain patterns just like click and

3529.04 --> 3533.2
now this is it now this is everything

3531.44 --> 3534.799
you face everything there is connected

3533.2 --> 3536.5589999999997
it must face

3534.799 --> 3538.079
each other and resolve

3536.559 --> 3541.52
next period and

3538.079 --> 3544.799
separation or more or another setup and

3541.52 --> 3548.24
just like a switching

3544.799 --> 3550.72
mace like the entire realm being a

3548.24 --> 3550.72
looping

3551.599 --> 3556.28
clock-based switching system

3573.92 --> 3579.28
here the molten looking glass

3576.24 --> 3579.2799999999997
mirage layer

3579.92 --> 3584.359
okay clary if you say so

3600.799 --> 3605.7599999999998
look it doesn't really yeah it's a good

3603.04 --> 3606.88
point you may clearly like yeah i get

3605.76 --> 3608.7990000000004
that

3606.88 --> 3611.44
just the waters above

3608.799 --> 3612.72
the horizon the blue sky

3611.44 --> 3614.559
like that but

3612.72 --> 3616.5589999999997
it's not really relevant look if there's

3614.559 --> 3618.3190000000004
gonna ha if there was a flood that

3616.559 --> 3620.799
literally flooded the world where did it

3618.319 --> 3623.7599999999998
come from it rained down right it didn't

3620.799 --> 3625.04
just like a giant tidal wave swept the

3623.76 --> 3627.2000000000003
entire realm

3625.04 --> 3629.68
so it came from above well if it came

3627.2 --> 3632.16
from above where did it came from above

3629.68 --> 3634.319
did it just materialize out of nothing

3632.16 --> 3636.16
or was there a gate open to another

3634.319 --> 3638.72
segment

3636.16 --> 3641.96
that was emptied

3638.72 --> 3641.9599999999996
in here

3642.72 --> 3645.839
and what was in there

3646.319 --> 3651.359
how long had it been there

3649.04 --> 3654.079
maybe that segment had been there since

3651.359 --> 3656.24
creation as well

3654.079 --> 3658.2400000000002
since the beginning who knows man who

3656.24 --> 3660.9599999999996
knows how many of these

3658.24 --> 3663.68
realm compartments

3660.96 --> 3668.559
might exist in one form or another that

3663.68 --> 3668.5589999999997
could at some point be open up to us

3668.799 --> 3673.68
by god's clockwork mechanism for this

3681.2 --> 3687.68
ah yeah mike zadoonich yes i did watch

3684.16 --> 3687.68
that one with the old paper

3688.319 --> 3691.52
it's been a while ago i don't remember

3689.92 --> 3693.76
exactly everything that was in there but

3691.52 --> 3697.24
it was interesting it was like

3693.76 --> 3697.2400000000002
something else

3704.24 --> 3708.72
the ancients didn't understand

3706.24 --> 3712.9199999999996
hydrological cycle

3708.72 --> 3712.9199999999996
really clearly

3716.72 --> 3719.9199999999996
i beg to differ

3723.039 --> 3730.48
still mad at you i'm not mad at you

3727.839 --> 3732.799
but you did abuse the wrench

3730.48 --> 3734.079
and there's a price

3732.799 --> 3738.28
that's that

3734.079 --> 3738.28
that doesn't make me mad at you

3745.68 --> 3750.0789999999997
should be mad at yourself

3747.68 --> 3751.9199999999996
for blatantly

3750.079 --> 3755.559
not following the rules and losing the

3751.92 --> 3755.559
wrench because of that

3762.89 --> 3765.98
[Music]

3787.119 --> 3790.119
so

3798.24 --> 3804.0
right you don't

3800.96 --> 3806.799
time body somebody out because you think

3804.0 --> 3806.799
it's annoying

3807.28 --> 3812.1600000000003
or you feel like it

3809.68 --> 3814.24
like maybe two years ago i would have

3812.16 --> 3815.839
allowed that

3814.24 --> 3819.2
in general

3815.839 --> 3822.24
but yeah the chat rules have

3819.2 --> 3823.1189999999997
crystal crystallized a little more than

3822.24 --> 3825.68
that

3823.119 --> 3827.2000000000003
it's just not how it works if you did

3825.68 --> 3829.359
that then

3827.2 --> 3830.72
if other people got the green light to

3829.359 --> 3833.7599999999998
do that

3830.72 --> 3836.3999999999996
then half my shows would be ruined

3833.76 --> 3838.559
because there's a lot of people in here

3836.4 --> 3840.319
that have controversial ideas that are

3838.559 --> 3842.48
gonna trigger and annoy others or

3840.319 --> 3844.4
they're just not really in the moment

3842.48 --> 3845.76
capable of putting it down without

3844.4 --> 3848.079
triggering it even though it might be a

3845.76 --> 3850.88
good point and that way

3848.079 --> 3855.28
information is lost

3850.88 --> 3855.28
if you use it because you feel like it

3857.92 --> 3862.079
right having a wrench is a

3859.68 --> 3864.16
responsibility it's not like oh you get

3862.079 --> 3866.1600000000003
the weapon you get to use the weapon no

3864.16 --> 3869.44
no

3866.16 --> 3869.44
first and foremost do

3869.52 --> 3874.319
get the challenge of not

3871.68 --> 3874.319
using it

3876.64 --> 3883.7599999999998
right just like karate you learn it

3880.72 --> 3883.7599999999998
to not fight

3886.4 --> 3890.079
just because you can't punch somebody

3888.4 --> 3891.76
you learn how to do it effectively

3890.079 --> 3893.28
doesn't mean that you could just punch

3891.76 --> 3897.119
everybody

3893.28 --> 3897.119
or punch when you feel like it no

3897.44 --> 3901.839
you learn it to not fight

3900.16 --> 3904.839
and the same goes for wrenches in my

3901.839 --> 3904.839
chat

3913.69 --> 3916.86
[Music]

3920.48 --> 3924.16
food people don't need wrenches

3922.799 --> 3926.319
that's right

3924.16 --> 3928.5589999999997
but a wrench can be

3926.319 --> 3931.68
useful if you have a lot of things that

3928.559 --> 3934.799
you share if you want to connect or

3931.68 --> 3936.3999999999996
yeah when there's actual trolls like

3934.799 --> 3938.64
blatant trolls

3936.4 --> 3940.96
that are getting disgusting disgusting

3938.64 --> 3941.92
and nasty gammas you know them

3940.96 --> 3943.839
right

3941.92 --> 3948.359
when you use it on them that's perfectly

3943.839 --> 3948.359
fine but you got to be careful

3954.88 --> 3962.2000000000003
to me that would explain

3957.2 --> 3962.2
is admiral bird id what

3965.52 --> 3973.0
if you heard about the glorious

3968.24 --> 3973.0
yeah i've seen videos in that direction

3989.28 --> 3992.28
what

4003.52 --> 4006.52
uh

4006.88 --> 4010.2400000000002
sorry this is

4008.079 --> 4014.44
downloading [ __ ]

4010.24 --> 4014.4399999999996
it keeps failing annoying

4046.72 --> 4050.5589999999997
a good servant what are you doing

4052.24 --> 4058.24
i mean yes amanda young has been a fan

4054.48 --> 4058.2400000000002
of my show for a very long time

4059.599 --> 4064.7200000000003
and she has supported me

4063.119 --> 4067.599
in the past

4064.72 --> 4070.16
and she still has

4067.599 --> 4073.76
a membership system or she has she is a

4070.16 --> 4073.7599999999998
member and i appreciate that

4074.319 --> 4078.24
but yeah the rules is rules

4076.799 --> 4082.52
just as it

4078.24 --> 4082.52
as counts for you good servant

4133.04 --> 4135.679
right so

4136.799 --> 4142.799
anything else

4139.6 --> 4145.799
going on out there that i missed

4142.799 --> 4145.799
uh

4150.88 --> 4154.4800000000005
i think nathan's going to be live again

4153.04 --> 4158.0
tomorrow

4154.48 --> 4158.0
hasn't literally said it

4158.799 --> 4163.159
but i think he is back home

4183.279 --> 4186.279
hmm

4190.48 --> 4195.678999999999
oh john d

4193.279 --> 4197.76
by the way like an hour ago

4195.679 --> 4199.679
uploaded a video i don't know what that

4197.76 --> 4201.52
is

4199.679 --> 4203.84
three minutes oh it's another laser

4201.52 --> 4203.84
video

4204.08 --> 4206.8
interesting

4208.159 --> 4211.159
hmm

4261.199 --> 4264.199
uh

4274.08 --> 4277.679
right so if there's nothing else i'm

4275.92 --> 4280.4800000000005
gonna run out the show i

4277.679 --> 4282.4
put down both subjects

4280.48 --> 4284.879999999999
great secret about radioactivity the

4282.4 --> 4288.639999999999
world could never handle

4284.88 --> 4288.64
i think radioactivity does

4289.04 --> 4293.36
like

4291.04 --> 4294.4
how there is a key to

4293.36 --> 4297.759999999999
being

4294.4 --> 4299.44
spiritually pure in the face of it

4297.76 --> 4301.84
to save you and

4299.44 --> 4301.839999999999
yeah

4302.08 --> 4306.48
i think if you consider it it's going to

4303.76 --> 4306.4800000000005
cascade

4306.719 --> 4312.56
to other situations and even

4309.84 --> 4315.76
myths and legends and

4312.56 --> 4317.280000000001
like mysterious suggestions

4315.76 --> 4320.56
and then

4317.28 --> 4323.12
i don't know it might make sense

4320.56 --> 4325.280000000001
and then of course there's the idea of

4323.12 --> 4327.5199999999995
the squid and fish people coming down

4325.28 --> 4329.599999999999
with the flood

4327.52 --> 4331.84
i hoped you guys would guess it quickly

4329.6 --> 4334.88
but you didn't

4331.84 --> 4334.88
but then later on

4334.96 --> 4339.6
kind of did guess it

4337.36 --> 4341.44
what my idea was

4339.6 --> 4343.280000000001
so yeah i think that that may be a

4341.44 --> 4345.12
possibility that that's where they came

4343.28 --> 4347.679
from they came from another realm

4345.12 --> 4349.679
segment that was mostly water

4347.679 --> 4352.0
and when the flood gates were opened

4349.679 --> 4354.8
from above they literally just came

4352.0 --> 4354.8
falling out of it

4355.36 --> 4360.32
and at that yeah you could consider them

4357.679 --> 4362.8
fallen angels sort of

4360.32 --> 4367.5599999999995
did come from above

4362.8 --> 4367.56
if they came down with the flood water

4378.88 --> 4383.76
but yeah that's still debatable it's

4380.96 --> 4386.32
just an idea anyway i hope you enjoyed

4383.76 --> 4386.320000000001

4478.8 --> 4483.08
again thanks everyone for coming

4488.56 --> 4494.88
oh thank you for the super chat there

4490.719 --> 4496.4
america silver patriot ten dollar

4494.88 --> 4500.719
thank you

4496.4 --> 4500.719
let me read those last chats before iran

4507.36 --> 4511.679
i believe as long as we argue against a

4509.76 --> 4513.92
true case

4511.679 --> 4516.64
with ourselves

4513.92 --> 4516.64
that is wrong

4517.28 --> 4521.599999999999
right as long as you argue against it as

4519.679 --> 4524.08
long as you are unwilling to accept the

4521.6 --> 4527.4400000000005
truth

4524.08 --> 4529.76
that's basically it and truth is god

4527.44 --> 4531.678999999999
right ego doesn't like that sometimes

4529.76 --> 4532.64
ego likes to have its

4531.679 --> 4535.84
own

4532.64 --> 4538.719
virtual grasp on reality

4535.84 --> 4541.4400000000005
ego wants to be the little g

4538.719 --> 4544.8
and in order for them for the ego to

4541.44 --> 4548.239
fully get immersed in that they have to

4544.8 --> 4550.64
exclude the truth

4548.239 --> 4553.12
the big g

4550.64 --> 4555.84
right so that's what i would say to that

4553.12 --> 4555.84
good statement

4556.159 --> 4562.08
the second firmament was created on

4558.56 --> 4564.400000000001
there too fallen injured cast out on day

4562.08 --> 4567.12
what

4564.4 --> 4569.28
uh i don't see that though america's

4567.12 --> 4571.5199999999995
overpatriot

4569.28 --> 4573.92
what fallen angels were not during

4571.52 --> 4575.76
creation are you not talking about the

4573.92 --> 4577.04
day

4575.76 --> 4578.4800000000005
what

4577.04 --> 4580.4
are you talking about the days of

4578.48 --> 4583.759999999999
creation there were the fallen angels

4580.4 --> 4583.759999999999
then that came later

4584.64 --> 4589.280000000001
but anyway thanks still for the super

4586.96 --> 4589.28
chat

4592.0 --> 4595.199
right

4593.04 --> 4597.36
so

4595.199 --> 4601.28
take it easy

4597.36 --> 4602.799999999999
the ancestral winds are coming

4601.28 --> 4606.4
so yeah

4602.8 --> 4611.1990000000005
say strong don't overreach

4606.4 --> 4612.48
don't downplay take things serious

4611.199 --> 4613.919999999999
because you don't want to weaken and

4612.48 --> 4617.839999999999
buckle right now

4613.92 --> 4617.84
pretty much in in the face of anything

4618.239 --> 4622.48
because of the ancestral winds

4620.32 --> 4624.4
you will regret it that that's a

4622.48 --> 4626.0
friendly warning by the way

4624.4 --> 4629.759999999999
so

4626.0 --> 4629.76
until the next video

4629.84 --> 4664.38
keep it flat

4633.16 --> 4664.38
[Music]

4683.92 --> 4686.0
you
