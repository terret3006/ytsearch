2.79 --> 10.15
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.88 --> 15.190000000000001
early-bird number 36 I'm your host

10.15 --> 20.859
Arwen it's a beautiful day today very

15.19 --> 23.108999999999998
cold but yeah the Sun again is warming

20.859 --> 27.399
up a lot but as soon as one of these

23.109 --> 31.449
clouds get in front of the Sun it's

27.399 --> 38.14
almost so cold that you symbolically

31.449 --> 41.230000000000004
could see ya the freshly defrosted water

38.14 --> 45.16
everywhere freeze over again because it

41.23 --> 49.209999999999994
is really cold without that Sun still

45.16 --> 62.649
some ice on the roofs there so yeah it's

49.21 --> 65.95
winter so welcome everyone a chat it's

62.649 --> 66.7
clearly flat earth non schooling Daniel

65.95 --> 69.82000000000001
field

66.7 --> 72.49000000000001
it's good to see you Nicholas stop in

69.82 --> 77.71
traffic in my rest I had good morning

72.49 --> 81.78
everyone so yeah there was some

77.71 --> 81.78
conversation earlier

82.98 --> 88.75
Daniel field I really like this guy he

86.35 --> 91.24
always brings up so many good subjects

88.75 --> 95.53
especially before the show it would be

91.24 --> 97.97999999999999
awesome if one day he could join it but

95.53 --> 101.17
I think he's busy during this hour just

97.98 --> 106.30000000000001
listening and chatting a little anyway

101.17 --> 110.74000000000001
he talks about emergence and it's very

106.3 --> 113.22
funny because technically emergence is

110.74 --> 116.14
pretty much the same thing as

113.22 --> 119.47
presuppositional reasoning except that

116.14 --> 123.84
emergence is the psychological element

119.47 --> 128.8
to it and the presupposition is the

123.84 --> 132.03
technical element to it so that's really

128.8 --> 132.03
interesting that you brought that up

134.62 --> 139.269
yeah thought it was a good point

143.109 --> 152.68
yeah emergence is the effect when you

147.159 --> 152.67999999999998
suspend your disbelief basically or

153.01 --> 160.939
assume a belief because of reasons or

158.989 --> 162.859
not knowing better and then just

160.939 --> 166.489
accepting something as being true and

162.859 --> 167.78
becoming harder that becoming part of

166.489 --> 169.519
the way you see things

167.78 --> 172.7
are you reasoning it out that's

169.519 --> 179.03
emergence suspect it's it's a form of

172.7 --> 181.28
suspense of disbelief so it's not

179.03 --> 184.819
technically the same it's similar it's a

181.28 --> 189.799
similar type of effect bending your mind

184.819 --> 193.25
to accommodate anyway hello they've

189.799 --> 195.87900000000002
agreed mr. Riggs

193.25 --> 195.879
j-mac

201.84 --> 210.14000000000001
so was kind of hilarious yesterday on

207.3 --> 210.14000000000001
the flavors debates

211.099 --> 216.23899999999998
maybe it's the winter I don't know what

214.05 --> 220.86
it is but seem to be a lot of more

216.239 --> 222.72
silent spaces and the ballers getting

220.86 --> 224.97000000000003
more trollish and Nathan getting more

222.72 --> 230.67
impatient it was particularly patient

224.97 --> 232.92
yesterday but yeah the bowlers aren't

230.67 --> 236.28
really getting more annoying as I

232.92 --> 238.319
predicted and but it was kind of funny

236.28 --> 242.549
and yeah once the ballers were all

238.319 --> 246.08999999999997
pretty much kicked out tossed like this

242.549 --> 249.84
long silence and and at some point I

246.09 --> 251.28
think oh wait now it was before that so

249.84 --> 253.799
weird there was like a long pause and

251.28 --> 261.03
Riley asked me like yeah talk about

253.799 --> 263.25
gravity okay so I did pretty much the

261.03 --> 265.08
most elaborate explanation I've given

263.25 --> 266.33
without interruption and it was just

265.08 --> 270.96
like what is this

266.33 --> 276.71999999999997
since when is Riley asking me to talk

270.96 --> 280.2
about gravity like that almost felt

276.72 --> 282.47900000000004
desperate in a way not that they're in a

280.2 --> 285.24
corner but like they're kind of bored or

282.479 --> 287.94
something so Riley's like okay well this

285.24 --> 290.669
isn't yeah we are too much in a

287.94 --> 293.46
consensus I need to throw up some dust

290.669 --> 295.71
okay well when Arwen talks about gravity

293.46 --> 300.33
I always get fired up and he gets fired

295.71 --> 305.34
up so okay are we talk about it was

300.33 --> 307.65
really an Aries but and weird but yeah I

305.34 --> 310.289
don't mind I don't mind talking about

307.65 --> 314.42999999999995
the aberration of gravity and explaining

310.289 --> 320.71999999999997
why it's an aberration and comparing it

314.43 --> 320.72
to other things so yeah it was funny

324.12 --> 331.629
David read says Nathan should be able to

326.83 --> 336.419
taser them that I think if that were the

331.629 --> 344.22900000000004
case then there'd not be any ballers

336.419 --> 350.53
anymore on the panel very quickly but in

344.229 --> 354.58
a way mentally he is tasering them so it

350.53 --> 357.969
almost does feel like that and they do

354.58 --> 363.37
respond as being shocked they basically

357.969 --> 367.06
become numb and they resort back to more

363.37 --> 370.21
basic behavior yeah so in that sense he

367.06 --> 375.43
does taser them by absolutely hammering

370.21 --> 379.77
them on psychological deviation tactics

375.43 --> 379.77
like on the nitty-gritty he is really

380.639 --> 388.81
yeah cutting it down to details that can

386.08 --> 391.659
be denied but that people usually don't

388.81 --> 394.029
hammer on because these are the

391.659 --> 396.219
subtleties of life and people are very

394.029 --> 399.159
tolerant in this toward each other and

396.219 --> 402.13
it's becoming worse right away more

399.159 --> 404.11
people are applying this kind of devious

402.13 --> 406.389
psychological tactics in their common

404.11 --> 408.25
daily life and people are getting used

406.389 --> 411.129
to it and being conditioned through

408.25 --> 415.74
media that that's it's being normalized

411.129 --> 419.62
and bad and yeah for Nathan to be really

415.74 --> 424.15000000000003
like a chip of the old block hammering

419.62 --> 425.65
it old fashioned um these types of

424.15 --> 429.87899999999996
things people aren't used to that

425.65 --> 433.12
anymore because yet teachers aren't

429.879 --> 435.46000000000004
allowed to do that anymore but yeah it

433.12 --> 438.389
had a function a very important function

435.46 --> 441.669
that's so funny people forget that and

438.389 --> 444.819
Nathan is now fulfilling that function

441.669 --> 447.039
and there easily enough he almost kind

444.819 --> 450.219
of found a corner in the market of needs

447.039 --> 452.529
and whether people understand that or

450.219 --> 455.02
not is another thing but yeah he has so

452.529 --> 456.129
many subscribers for a reason whether

455.02 --> 460.35999999999996
these people think

456.129 --> 464.519
all I hate him or they just love seeing

460.36 --> 469.089
that happen there is a need for it and

464.519 --> 471.42900000000003
that need is being removed from society

469.089 --> 475.11899999999997
there's no more schools with these types

471.429 --> 477.159
of teachers almost no everybody so

475.119 --> 479.97900000000004
tolerant and people get away with really

477.159 --> 483.99899999999997
shitty behavior so it's good to see

479.979 --> 487.709
somebody finally taking on this shitty

483.999 --> 493.41900000000004
behavior into the court and just

487.709 --> 498.49
exposing the indecency indeed and the

493.419 --> 503.339
lies and yeah all of that so he has a

498.49 --> 508.99
need for it and I like that I don't

503.339 --> 513.49
really like doing it myself unless it's

508.99 --> 515.769
just I do like doing it but it's not

513.49 --> 520.029
healthy for me because what I do what I

515.769 --> 521.8
do it with a lot of passion and you

520.029 --> 527.47
really have to be you really have to

521.8 --> 529.5089999999999
deserve it badly and yeah you know what

527.47 --> 532.0600000000001
I guess that most ballers that get

529.509 --> 535.1800000000001
really rough treatment on Flat Earth

532.06 --> 538.3599999999999
debates if Nathan wouldn't do that then

535.18 --> 540.939
probably I would automatically start

538.36 --> 546.91
doing that or the others in their own

540.939 --> 549.31
way so I guess it's not that normal I

546.91 --> 551.17
guess it's more about the way he does he

549.31 --> 553.779
really does it like an old-fashioned

551.17 --> 555.54
teacher that's very sharp and that is

553.779 --> 561.009
cool

555.54 --> 567.779
he does it with with style like it and

561.009 --> 579.72
he gets better at it it's flat smacking

567.779 --> 579.72
yeah talk to anybody recently

583.01 --> 589.89
yeah in the real world I mean not on the

586.62 --> 599.01
Internet plenty watching a lot of Star

589.89 --> 606.5699999999999
Trek and well you know what yeah I did

599.01 --> 609.51
kind of talk to was a social worker

606.57 --> 613.5300000000001
again yeah I do that every now and then

609.51 --> 615.83
and the person I rich me know as some

613.53 --> 618.39
back problem so they are out of the run

615.83 --> 623.13
and I got somebody else getting to know

618.39 --> 626.64
them was a little nervous at first but

623.13 --> 630.51
they turn out to be pretty cool and yeah

626.64 --> 634.02
I really talked to him about yeah how am

630.51 --> 639.21
I gonna build up my life and funny thing

634.02 --> 642.3299999999999
is is that the hangouts what I'm doing

639.21 --> 647.5500000000001
right now and debates in general hey

642.33 --> 649.71
somebody hold on sorry oh hello hi can

647.55 --> 653.55
you hear me yeah can area I'll get right

649.71 --> 658.5300000000001
back to you after I finish this so yeah

653.55 --> 662.6099999999999
I explained how doing this is basically

658.53 --> 666.23
working on getting income eventually

662.61 --> 668.88
yeah it's just like Nathan says you know

666.23 --> 672.0
it's a way if you're gonna spend a lot

668.88 --> 676.08
of time on it then you can yeah you

672.0 --> 678.72
don't have to be shy to try to get some

676.08 --> 681.9000000000001
funding out of it just to support

678.72 --> 684.5400000000001
yourself and everything and I do plan to

681.9 --> 687.09
do that I've been saying this from the

684.54 --> 690.8399999999999
start like I don't like standard

687.09 --> 692.73
advertising but yeah if it's necessary

690.84 --> 695.22
to get super chats and everything then I

692.73 --> 698.79
will I guess try it out see if it's not

695.22 --> 700.62
too terrible to see what goes you know

698.79 --> 704.4
can always turn it off again but anyway

700.62 --> 708.54
yeah he'd recognized it very well as a

704.4 --> 710.85
legitimate career choice and that's very

708.54 --> 712.3499999999999
interesting I didn't I haven't told him

710.85 --> 714.15
yet about flattery

712.35 --> 716.76
yet I don't know he might actually know

714.15 --> 722.22
it I don't know how well he researches

716.76 --> 724.3199999999999
people but yeah he should be able to

722.22 --> 728.34
find out what my channel is even through

724.32 --> 730.8900000000001
the yeah through his colleague because

728.34 --> 733.23
yeah she knows everything about me and

730.89 --> 739.38
absolutely openly there trust her fully

733.23 --> 743.07
she's awesome but yeah maybe he knows

739.38 --> 745.8
about that stuff too I think in

743.07 --> 747.7800000000001
eventually I might end up having a very

745.8 --> 749.79
interesting conversation with him about

747.78 --> 752.43
it because he might be talking with

749.79 --> 756.78
other people about it as well I think

752.43 --> 757.26
that a lot of people deal with Flat

756.78 --> 760.5899999999999
Earth

757.26 --> 763.8
maybe not publicly like I do and the

760.59 --> 766.35
flat earthers as much online all that

763.8 --> 768.66
but they do think about it

766.35 --> 770.94
and contemplate it for a while and have

768.66 --> 773.91
to talk about it maybe gives them

770.94 --> 778.62
anxiety yeah it's not strange usually

773.91 --> 782.04
does that first sleepless nights so yeah

778.62 --> 784.65
even though we don't see or hear from

782.04 --> 786.93
these people directly there are likely

784.65 --> 788.76
to be a lot of people that are dealing

786.93 --> 792.29
with it or have dealt with it on their

788.76 --> 798.33
own and people like social workers will

792.29 --> 801.87
typically get get wind of that so anyway

798.33 --> 806.7900000000001
that's that's sorry for taking so long

801.87 --> 809.8100000000001
hellos in there thanks for joining

806.79 --> 813.2099999999999
glad to be here do you think the

809.81 --> 817.1999999999999
Sentinels or how are they called the

813.21 --> 819.51
people who live on a island in an Indian

817.2 --> 822.71
Island I think they think the world is

819.51 --> 826.86
flat there are no they're alright yeah

822.71 --> 828.84
they almost 100% think the world is flat

826.86 --> 831.33
so I think it's kind of interesting

828.84 --> 834.4200000000001
there are a lot of people who aren't in

831.33 --> 839.1600000000001
the flat earth movement yet I think they

834.42 --> 844.92
are agree that the world is flat so even

839.16 --> 846.87
if you're India the thing is a lot of

844.92 --> 849.6899999999999
people that don't

846.87 --> 854.07
are not very metropolitan minded a lot

849.69 --> 856.3800000000001
of them just keep it to themselves but

854.07 --> 858.75
yeah not everybody believes in all that

856.38 --> 862.5889999999999
space or even have the stomach for it

858.75 --> 868.29
some just don't like it out of the

862.589 --> 870.96
people I yeah sorry the the people I

868.29 --> 874.74
talked about are these who recently

870.96 --> 876.72
killed the American who tried to bring

874.74 --> 879.36
Christianity to them you know those

876.72 --> 881.5500000000001
people who kind of they still live with

879.36 --> 883.41
bow and arrow and they shoot arrows at

881.55 --> 885.9599999999999
the helicopters and so on

883.41 --> 891.12
have you heard of them where's that in

885.96 --> 895.2
South America on the island Indian

891.12 --> 902.49
island they oh wait I'm from India I can

895.2 --> 913.49
show myself I think I know which one you

902.49 --> 913.49
mean but I forgot the name they like I

915.41 --> 921.0889999999999
know it's a small island

918.45 --> 923.97
it's Sri Lanka I don't think the people

921.089 --> 927.9300000000001
there still shoot with bow and I wrong I

923.97 --> 931.38
can tell I posted the link in the side

927.93 --> 937.02
shots if you want to see they are called

931.38 --> 940.5889999999999
the Dora surf really really whew yeah so

937.02 --> 945.39
so one sometimes they killed fishermen

940.589 --> 947.36
who like go there by accident it's kind

945.39 --> 950.88
of interesting just wanted to point out

947.36 --> 952.98
there are a lot of people who didn't go

950.88 --> 957.23
in the flat earth movement the recent

952.98 --> 960.45
red or and think the earth is flat I

957.23 --> 963.0600000000001
think there are more of those people who

960.45 --> 968.01
think the earth is flat than the people

963.06 --> 972.18
who who got noticed by it by the social

968.01 --> 975.75
media and so on these islands they're

972.18 --> 979.829
not really next to India they're rather

975.75 --> 980.56
close to the Philippines yeah but in

979.829 --> 983.1999999999999
your own

980.56 --> 985.3599999999999
those islands that's why I mean Indian

983.2 --> 990.97
island they are still in Indian

985.36 --> 998.38
Territory mm-hmm so ideas like the

990.97 --> 1004.08
authority of them so to speak yeah yeah

998.38 --> 1007.46
interesting something else I wanted to

1004.08 --> 1010.5
ask have you ever tried to compare the

1007.46 --> 1014.9100000000001
angular size of the things they call

1010.5 --> 1018.029
planets to the orbital distance and

1014.91 --> 1022.35
actual size they gave us and see and

1018.029 --> 1027.05
compare if it matches up or not no I

1022.35 --> 1032.48
carry honest no I find that stuff very

1027.05 --> 1034.98
annoying like doing that kind of thing I

1032.48 --> 1038.49
was going to try to see if there are

1034.98 --> 1045.06
like any flaws in their system you know

1038.49 --> 1053.4
because they say Mars will change in

1045.06 --> 1055.29
distance from where was it like said at

1053.4 --> 1058.89
some point Mars will be seven times

1055.29 --> 1066.9289999999999
closer to us than on other points to say

1058.89 --> 1070.679
so when was it like on January 1st more

1066.929 --> 1076.38
Mars will be 300 million kilometers away

1070.679 --> 1081.0600000000002
to say and on July 1st of the 1st 5th

1076.38 --> 1085.8000000000002
July it will be 50 million kilometers

1081.06 --> 1090.6499999999999
like this the the like 7 times farther

1085.8 --> 1094.35
away right so we should be able to see a

1090.65 --> 1097.74
change in angular size in the sky if the

1094.35 --> 1098.9099999999999
if it was this what the claim it is

1097.74 --> 1101.49
right Wow

1098.91 --> 1104.52
well that would be very difficult to

1101.49 --> 1108.38
measure well I mean there are very small

1104.52 --> 1112.3799999999999
can you really it is small get out as a

1108.38 --> 1114.5400000000002
do you even know yeah can't even

1112.38 --> 1116.25
properly focus on it and

1114.54 --> 1120.06
like the Stars because that's very

1116.25 --> 1121.98
difficult to do with the Stars no can

1120.06 --> 1127.71
you do that with with a real non digital

1121.98 --> 1130.92
telescope um I don't know if if you even

1127.71 --> 1134.3400000000001
need a telescope I mean it is it will be

1130.92 --> 1137.3100000000002
hard of course but if you have like I

1134.34 --> 1140.58
don't know you I think you can make

1137.31 --> 1143.25
something with paper or so if you if you

1140.58 --> 1147.48
know the distance from the from your ID

1143.25 --> 1149.96
to the thing you can make like a hole or

1147.48 --> 1153.84
so in it which represents a certain

1149.96 --> 1156.24
amount of arc minutes or so right and

1153.84 --> 1159.03
then you can see if there is a distance

1156.24 --> 1161.67
to it if there is a difference to it

1159.03 --> 1164.1
from Morse - you are at some point

1161.67 --> 1169.04
because I don't know yet how to

1164.1 --> 1171.86
calculate it there is a formula for

1169.04 --> 1178.3999999999999
measuring the angular size of objects

1171.86 --> 1183.7099999999998
right astronomy stuff this yeah but yeah

1178.4 --> 1183.71
maybe there is I don't know I don't know

1184.85 --> 1194.1
well we do know that the moon size

1188.82 --> 1196.82
changes like through the seasons and

1194.1 --> 1199.9199999999998
that is very apparent and the Sun

1196.82 --> 1201.57
changes its light at least don't know if

1199.92 --> 1203.19
the disc actually gets bigger and

1201.57 --> 1206.01
smaller as well I don't know there's

1203.19 --> 1210.15
these rumors about this yeah so yeah who

1206.01 --> 1214.11
knows maybe the wandering stars the

1210.15 --> 1216.42
planetoids the planets also become

1214.11 --> 1219.06
smaller and bigger over the seasons

1216.42 --> 1219.99
would be very interesting to see that's

1219.06 --> 1222.84
really true

1219.99 --> 1226.56
although yeah what was it again the

1222.84 --> 1229.9499999999998
difference seven times the distance is

1226.56 --> 1234.84
pretty radical it's not gonna be like a

1229.95 --> 1238.6200000000001
20% size shift or something yeah that's

1234.84 --> 1242.82
why I would want to see if I can like

1238.62 --> 1246.4199999999998
find any flaws in it or so so I could

1242.82 --> 1248.22
presented to some people because at the

1246.42 --> 1251.3700000000001
end they gave us an

1248.22 --> 1253.83
that has to be perfect and if there is

1251.37 --> 1257.7299999999998
anything in the night sky that doesn't

1253.83 --> 1261.6589999999999
match with what they say their model

1257.73 --> 1265.1100000000001
will fall apart so I think it is kind of

1261.659 --> 1268.98
important to try to find the flaws in

1265.11 --> 1269.399
their model right okay I guess you're

1268.98 --> 1271.95
right

1269.399 --> 1275.85
although yeah for me the moon and the

1271.95 --> 1279.69
way the darkening of the moon works and

1275.85 --> 1282.36
everything that is so yeah already in

1279.69 --> 1284.809
your face and I reversible with the eye

1282.36 --> 1288.74
that that doesn't make any damn sense

1284.809 --> 1291.69
so I would yeah continue on you know

1288.74 --> 1295.289
there's more of these holes always good

1291.69 --> 1299.1290000000001
to dig in mm-hmm I agree because like

1295.289 --> 1302.61
time and date they tell us every single

1299.129 --> 1305.4599999999998
detail writers at tell us where Mars is

1302.61 --> 1308.639
when it is miscible how far away it is

1305.46 --> 1311.669
and the angular size of it I couldn't

1308.639 --> 1313.889
find yet it is you can calculate it by

1311.669 --> 1317.3090000000002
having the distance and the diameter of

1313.889 --> 1319.5
Mars and then you can calculate the

1317.309 --> 1320.539
angular size so if anything doesn't

1319.5 --> 1323.519
match up

1320.539 --> 1325.289
they are kind of [ __ ] aren't they but

1323.519 --> 1328.799
I think they will just say I I it's

1325.289 --> 1332.149
because of I don't know may Rajah's or

1328.799 --> 1336.87
so I don't know what I will come up with

1332.149 --> 1339.75
let's see I I hope I kind of so many

1336.87 --> 1342.12
weird excuses like the whole thing that

1339.75 --> 1344.07
stars can't be seen out of the

1342.12 --> 1347.2199999999998
atmosphere because of the atmosphere

1344.07 --> 1351.72
that kind of you know they already it

1347.22 --> 1355.5
yeah band-aids theorizing the [ __ ] out

1351.72 --> 1358.049
of it all so I think they're gonna Bend

1355.5 --> 1360.87
ate the [ __ ] out of this as well like

1358.049 --> 1361.86
you said some weird excuse some

1360.87 --> 1366.899
technobabble

1361.86 --> 1370.35
thing perhaps kind of refraction they

1366.899 --> 1372.9599999999998
invented but that they would have no

1370.35 --> 1375.87
excuse I mean even for the moon why it's

1372.96 --> 1379.799
gravity based refresh and graph yeah

1375.87 --> 1381.58
luhan's on and that's why ya see that

1379.799 --> 1383.2
I mean what

1381.58 --> 1385.48
they come up with I mean even for the

1383.2 --> 1388.9
moon what but what was their excuse you

1385.48 --> 1393.33
you said you could see the moon changing

1388.9 --> 1397.9
in anger size right many times abruptly

1393.33 --> 1401.6499999999999
all right it's all that a mirage but and

1397.9 --> 1403.69
they have no reason as to why yeah yes a

1401.65 --> 1404.17
it's a mirage we don't know why it

1403.69 --> 1407.0800000000002
happen

1404.17 --> 1410.3500000000001
the space is supposedly empty between

1407.08 --> 1413.3999999999999
the moon and the earth so there is zero

1410.35 --> 1416.6499999999999
reason while I should change in any way

1413.4 --> 1419.47
from the moon to the earth when it

1416.65 --> 1423.01
enters the atmosphere as they call it

1419.47 --> 1427.24
maybe then but it will always have the

1423.01 --> 1429.16
same effect you know no matter you know

1427.24 --> 1430.8700000000001
you know no matter how the moon should

1429.16 --> 1433.8600000000001
change or whatever it would always have

1430.87 --> 1436.3899999999999
the same effect so it makes zero sense

1433.86 --> 1439.5
indeed but the weirdest thing about it

1436.39 --> 1443.0800000000002
mostly is that it changes so abruptly

1439.5 --> 1446.59
like it suddenly launches itself towards

1443.08 --> 1450.6699999999998
the earth for a significant distance and

1446.59 --> 1453.52
then just halts and continues its orbit

1450.67 --> 1460.27
like it jumps that's really what it's

1453.52 --> 1461.23
like it's very quick have you ever seen

1460.27 --> 1464.86
it by yourself

1461.23 --> 1475.45
because I've seen a video right do you

1464.86 --> 1477.28
remember yeah it's kind of a thing

1475.45 --> 1479.98
because they I don't think the moon

1477.28 --> 1483.31
should change in distance on the

1479.98 --> 1486.13
heliocentric model right it they say it

1483.31 --> 1490.51
always has approximately the same

1486.13 --> 1496.21
distance varies by I don't know 100 of

1490.51 --> 1498.28
the distance to the earth I yeah it

1496.21 --> 1500.5900000000001
makes no sense why should that the only

1498.28 --> 1503.29
reason why on the under model it should

1500.59 --> 1505.75
change in angular size is because you

1503.29 --> 1508.72
know because it comes closer or it goes

1505.75 --> 1514.0
further away and anything else has there

1508.72 --> 1515.47
zero excuse for that nothing there is no

1514.0 --> 1520.75
air there is

1515.47 --> 1523.059
nothing to interact with it's nothing no

1520.75 --> 1526.929
but they're just going on the

1523.059 --> 1531.8999999999999
mathematical model of it so of the

1526.929 --> 1536.169
presupposed 3d mechanics of it all and

1531.9 --> 1538.15
just filling in the gaps with stories

1536.169 --> 1539.919
and imaginings and yeah that doesn't

1538.15 --> 1540.3700000000001
always really match up that's the

1539.919 --> 1544.39
problem

1540.37 --> 1546.789
it's a Frankenstein monster yeah yeah I

1544.39 --> 1551.38
hope yeah I could do the same with other

1546.789 --> 1555.1299999999999
planets with the things the lights in

1551.38 --> 1559.5900000000001
the sky that called planets like where

1555.13 --> 1562.9
are they I am looking up right now the

1559.59 --> 1568.9289999999999
difference in angular size and trying to

1562.9 --> 1574.0900000000001
find the most severe one like all right

1568.929 --> 1581.74
like Venus should change in anger size

1574.09 --> 1583.99
from 9.7 to 11.6 like almost like yeah

1581.74 --> 1585.97
it's also crazy yeah you've got such a

1583.99 --> 1589.03
good point here I never even thought of

1585.97 --> 1592.48
that you know that in the orbits around

1589.03 --> 1595.69
the Sun the distances of all these

1592.48 --> 1597.85
bodies should be changing dramatically I

1595.69 --> 1600.97
never even thought about that that's

1597.85 --> 1606.49
actually really smart it's really sharp

1600.97 --> 1609.34
of you I'm just trying to look and then

1606.49 --> 1611.409
look in the night sky and see if it

1609.34 --> 1614.559
matches up or not and if it doesn't

1611.409 --> 1618.0700000000002
match up they they have no excuse for it

1614.559 --> 1621.549
right well the thing is I've never like

1618.07 --> 1627.82
I'm not a astronomy yeah I did look for

1621.549 --> 1631.69
you and mm because I was into that for a

1627.82 --> 1633.7
while it's my girlfriend but yeah other

1631.69 --> 1635.1100000000001
than that no never really the stars I

1633.7 --> 1636.94
always looked at the stars and planets

1635.11 --> 1638.9189999999999
and everything with the naked eye and

1636.94 --> 1641.95
then just thought yeah I'm seeing it the

1638.919 --> 1643.5700000000002
lights it just blurs it up so I don't

1641.95 --> 1646.539
really know how big it is but it's it's

1643.57 --> 1648.01
there people say okay that's that things

1646.539 --> 1649.059
like oh this looks like Venus because

1648.01 --> 1652.96
it's super bright

1649.059 --> 1655.84
in the morning that kind of thing and I

1652.96 --> 1659.23
never even liked thought about okay if

1655.84 --> 1661.779
this is really all again our solar

1659.23 --> 1665.379
system then yeah these lights should

1661.779 --> 1668.759
become bigger and smaller never even

1665.379 --> 1668.759
thought about that at all

1669.12 --> 1675.5189999999998
amazing

1670.36 --> 1678.37
I miss things can escape you yeah I mean

1675.519 --> 1681.7
it's it's kind of funny because when you

1678.37 --> 1683.32
look at the distance from a supposed

1681.7 --> 1685.539
planet to the earth they will always

1683.32 --> 1689.769
have this fixed value right and people

1685.539 --> 1693.039
thank you yeah whatever um I think uh

1689.769 --> 1695.289
yeah Mars is like some millions miles

1693.039 --> 1699.999
away from Earth and it will stay that

1695.289 --> 1704.019
way but but they not only the the earth

1699.999 --> 1706.3890000000001
supposedly has a lyrical orbit which

1704.019 --> 1710.95
always changes the distance to the Sun

1706.389 --> 1713.32
at some various right the other planets

1710.95 --> 1716.47
at some point they will be much farther

1713.32 --> 1720.46
away by their orbit right that the

1716.47 --> 1725.559
distance as they told us changes by a

1720.46 --> 1729.22
lot so so people just look at it right

1725.559 --> 1732.789
and then they think yeah the Sun is so

1729.22 --> 1735.009
far away the earth the earth is so far

1732.789 --> 1738.94
away from the other planet yet they

1735.009 --> 1741.6100000000001
never look further into it it seems and

1738.94 --> 1744.3990000000001
the people who do I don't know if they

1741.61 --> 1747.119
are honest with the numbers or not so

1744.399 --> 1752.7099999999998
this is what I trying to find out right

1747.119 --> 1755.4089999999999
yeah well these models are yeah as long

1752.71 --> 1758.3400000000001
as they explain some things then people

1755.409 --> 1760.8690000000001
will settle for and it's not meant to

1758.34 --> 1764.1999999999998
critically analyze basically it's a

1760.869 --> 1767.59
story a story that supposedly gives

1764.2 --> 1770.289
answers and people are glad enough to

1767.59 --> 1773.139
get some answers at first about these

1770.289 --> 1776.44
things and after that's like oh yeah

1773.139 --> 1779.6789999999999
okay this is what people say that causes

1776.44 --> 1781.71
that fine don't really talk about it in

1779.679 --> 1785.44
general anyway

1781.71 --> 1787.6000000000001
yeah excuse me for some minutes I have

1785.44 --> 1792.28
to do something for a moment

1787.6 --> 1795.24
babe I write back good stuff it's

1792.28 --> 1795.24
amazing

1795.45 --> 1808.0900000000001
you never never even thought about that

1801.03 --> 1812.05
bizarre but yes in there is right in the

1808.09 --> 1815.52
orbits around the Sun and everything all

1812.05 --> 1821.44
the the wandering stars the planets

1815.52 --> 1823.6299999999999
should dramatically change in size which

1821.44 --> 1829.23
well at least would be measured in

1823.63 --> 1834.0100000000002
brightness dramatically from a minor

1829.23 --> 1837.33
pixel like linear yeah small star - for

1834.01 --> 1840.07
the large size potentially you like

1837.33 --> 1845.32
seven times ten times as big but

1840.07 --> 1846.1599999999999
dramatically so do we see that now I'm

1845.32 --> 1849.52
really curious

1846.16 --> 1853.1200000000001
I never telescope but that will be

1849.52 --> 1857.11
really cool to see what people can can

1853.12 --> 1859.7399999999998
analyze in this but yeah I never never

1857.11 --> 1859.74
thought about that

1869.24 --> 1895.28
so who's there in its Clark Sabrina

1912.3 --> 1918.86
Mason when you mention you anyway

1929.38 --> 1937.8700000000001
I'm back sorry Sabrina I seen I have a

1935.259 --> 1942.519
telescope but no camera to record the

1937.87 --> 1945.8799999999999
findings just a question to you have you

1942.519 --> 1949.57
ever observed Mars changing in angular

1945.88 --> 1953.7
sizes with the telescope or have you

1949.57 --> 1957.49
ever looked at it I have but only rarely

1953.7 --> 1959.919
maybe two or three times ago when I

1957.49 --> 1963.34
wasn't really thinking I meant

1959.919 --> 1967.539
so I meant Sabrina has ever seen it with

1963.34 --> 1969.279
a telescope because the person said I

1967.539 --> 1971.35
have a telescope but no camera to record

1969.279 --> 1973.629
to finds you don't have to just from

1971.35 --> 1978.57
your experience if you have ever seen

1973.629 --> 1982.6
something like it right Sabrina yeah

1978.57 --> 1984.639
maybe a person knows it or or s ever

1982.6 --> 1987.6999999999998
seen it because I don't have a telescope

1984.639 --> 1993.4599999999998
either maybe I will never change

1987.7 --> 1997.6000000000001
okay maybe maybe I will I will buy one

1993.46 --> 1999.3400000000001
and at some point I will try to observe

1997.6 --> 2002.009
it because you're right it's kind of

1999.34 --> 2004.32
hard to see those change without any

2002.009 --> 2008.6390000000001
telescope or whatsoever because it's

2004.32 --> 2012.299
really really small right it is just

2008.639 --> 2015.4799999999998
like a star so the shine of the light is

2012.299 --> 2018.389
gonna make it difficult for your naked

2015.48 --> 2023.429
eye to really make out any size of it

2018.389 --> 2025.4699999999998
yeah if I don't see it at all if it's

2023.429 --> 2028.019
bright enough for your eyes at all yeah

2025.47 --> 2031.98
I think I have to be careful with those

2028.019 --> 2033.659
observations because a Mars will always

2031.98 --> 2037.98
look a little bit reddish so I think

2033.659 --> 2040.8300000000002
it's not hard to find it unlike your

2037.98 --> 2041.49
orange reddish so yeah what I meant

2040.83 --> 2048.089
you're right

2041.49 --> 2053.669
more orange orange II III agree Mars

2048.089 --> 2057.119
looks more orange than red but it will I

2053.669 --> 2059.669
will have to be really careful if I want

2057.119 --> 2064.3990000000003
to do those observations because there

2059.669 --> 2064.399
is a lot of space for errors

2067.25 --> 2080.879
although Laureus in the church yeah yeah

2076.069 --> 2083.339
hey it's a little bit obsessed with Flat

2080.879 --> 2087.109
Earth isn't it sorry a little bit

2083.339 --> 2091.0789999999997
obsessed with Flat Earth has so many are

2087.109 --> 2094.169
it's kind of funny I think I had a

2091.079 --> 2099.869
stupid conversation I think it's funny

2094.169 --> 2103.92
and sad and terrifying at all

2099.869 --> 2107.7000000000003
simultaneously the kind of stupid

2103.92 --> 2110.19
conversation with some baller first on

2107.7 --> 2113.4199999999996
the comments and I think people just

2110.19 --> 2118.53
sometimes take me too serious I guess

2113.42 --> 2120.96
because at some point it got just so

2118.53 --> 2128.13
ridiculous and I felt like yeah let's

2120.96 --> 2133.98
let's just stop because wait a moment

2128.13 --> 2137.19
maybe I can find it so I told one life

2133.98 --> 2139.76
we live in a 2d space and differ spatial

2137.19 --> 2144.059
dimension is just the hologram right and

2139.76 --> 2146.5200000000004
people talking so serious about it that

2144.059 --> 2150.809
I get so brain dead and so on that I

2146.52 --> 2152.73
don't get it I think that the

2150.809 --> 2160.3190000000004
orthographic world is their real world

2152.73 --> 2164.25
and the site is just the science fiction

2160.319 --> 2167.19
yeah very Tirana SHhhh I love it

2164.25 --> 2171.69
sometimes people I don't know people

2167.19 --> 2175.079
sometimes people expect to the the most

2171.69 --> 2177.839
ridiculous things that that they can't

2175.079 --> 2179.76
just read something and take it as a

2177.839 --> 2184.04
joke right even if you point it out you

2179.76 --> 2184.0400000000004
can if you can devise a model of it

2187.04 --> 2195.75
really funny all right so uh what does a

2191.309 --> 2197.07
pole sorry No so he accuse me of being a

2195.75 --> 2199.98
pole and then I

2197.07 --> 2203.67
I looked at I looked it up and then

2199.98 --> 2209.93
let's just for fun like the there is

2203.67 --> 2213.9300000000003
some guy who who died 150 years ago and

2209.93 --> 2221.79
maybe I can find like yeah I don't PO I

2213.93 --> 2227.24
know yes held in high regard in I know

2221.79 --> 2230.25
about him yeah so so I thought I honey I

2227.24 --> 2235.74
asked him if he meant if I am the sky

2230.25 --> 2237.69
right then he yeah you might be branded

2235.74 --> 2240.0299999999997
for brain dead for sure like a lot of

2237.69 --> 2243.66
zombies around these days well then he

2240.03 --> 2247.05
would be asking you are you gay Allen

2243.66 --> 2252.0499999999997
Poe one of the things he said is that he

2247.05 --> 2252.05
missed his gay lover from the future oh

2256.37 --> 2262.74
so he wife so I said there one property

2260.79 --> 2264.87
of people who died 150 years ago is

2262.74 --> 2268.08
being brain dead so I didn't really get

2264.87 --> 2270.2999999999997
why he asked me if I'm prayin touch so

2268.08 --> 2271.08
if I mean if I'm Allen Poe and I have to

2270.3 --> 2273.9900000000002
be brain dead

2271.08 --> 2277.68
no but you might be like possessed by

2273.99 --> 2279.7799999999997
Allen Poe all right yeah I read that

2277.68 --> 2282.18
went into the future that is one of the

2279.78 --> 2284.7900000000004
theories about it what happened to it he

2282.18 --> 2289.6699999999996
had an amazing outer body experience and

2284.79 --> 2292.47
went into the future yeah I don't I

2289.67 --> 2296.09
don't know why he accused me to be Allen

2292.47 --> 2300.0
Poe to be honest maybe he can tell me

2296.09 --> 2304.26
the reason in the chat I don't I really

2300.0 --> 2308.34
didn't get it it could be many things he

2304.26 --> 2314.28
was kind of ridiculous like a very weird

2308.34 --> 2317.52
person he was gay like very unusual yeah

2314.28 --> 2319.8
like very gay for that time and yeah he

2317.52 --> 2325.44
was considered insane because of his

2319.8 --> 2328.38
stories about going to future so so so

2325.44 --> 2330.7000000000003
it could be all of those reasons could

2328.38 --> 2338.26
be maybe

2330.7 --> 2343.5099999999998
I found really funny because many many

2338.26 --> 2346.03
ballers who noticed that I'm kind of

2343.51 --> 2346.69
flattered right now they just think I am

2346.03 --> 2350.5600000000004
insane

2346.69 --> 2353.14
and it's I think it's really funny I it

2350.56 --> 2355.93
is it sometimes it's really funny to

2353.14 --> 2358.72
mess with them right because you just

2355.93 --> 2360.8199999999997
write so ridiculous things like with the

2358.72 --> 2363.3689999999997
with the second and the third dimension

2360.82 --> 2366.82
and we all live in the 2d space and so

2363.369 --> 2369.099
and to buy this [ __ ] sometimes sometimes

2366.82 --> 2371.56
they really take you completely serious

2369.099 --> 2376.96
and you can type whatever you want they

2371.56 --> 2380.349
just buy the [ __ ] and it's just so funny

2376.96 --> 2381.78
to mess with them isn't it [ __ ] I almost

2380.349 --> 2389.1400000000003
fell over

2381.78 --> 2391.6600000000003
well yeah can be funny I guess I but the

2389.14 --> 2395.02
thing is I'd really find it sad in a way

2391.66 --> 2399.19
you know look I love to speculate but I

2395.02 --> 2402.43
always know that it is speculation and

2399.19 --> 2405.369
these people don't so it's kind of sad

2402.43 --> 2407.1699999999996
to do that with them and even yeah

2405.369 --> 2411.51
especially if you realize that they

2407.17 --> 2417.91
literally start to believe you it's just

2411.51 --> 2422.25
it feels wrong you know I I talked to my

2417.91 --> 2426.43
friends about Flat Earth last weekend's

2422.25 --> 2430.839
all of them they they just think I'm

2426.43 --> 2433.81
joking with them like I said I already

2430.839 --> 2435.97
told them that I don't think the earth

2433.81 --> 2438.19
is a globe because of various reasons I

2435.97 --> 2439.99
explained it to them and they are little

2438.19 --> 2443.339
they were like laughing and saying yeah

2439.99 --> 2448.95
you just don't you don't mess with us

2443.339 --> 2451.99
like yeah like nice joke dudes I mean

2448.95 --> 2456.24
whatever yeah they think you're a

2451.99 --> 2461.2299999999996
Martian yeah exactly

2456.24 --> 2464.8489999999997
maybe maybe it should stay that way I

2461.23 --> 2468.39
guess for for a while

2464.849 --> 2472.71
let's see I mean how should I approach

2468.39 --> 2477.64
them at all I mean maybe maybe if I find

2472.71 --> 2480.4900000000002
more of the flaws in the heliocentric

2477.64 --> 2482.74
system to regarding the distance of them

2480.49 --> 2485.4399999999996
to Mars and angular size and everything

2482.74 --> 2488.859
if I can get some evidence and show it

2485.44 --> 2492.04
to that I can start with not I can start

2488.859 --> 2495.46
with not the earth being flat but I can

2492.04 --> 2499.96
start with a maybe maybe what they told

2495.46 --> 2503.98
us about the orbit mechanical behavior

2499.96 --> 2507.39
of Mars and Venus and so on maybe it is

2503.98 --> 2510.31
wrong right yeah absolutely you could

2507.39 --> 2512.859
so let's see maybe maybe I found

2510.31 --> 2515.95
something yeah I think you definitely

2512.859 --> 2517.869
did find something and I just astounded

2515.95 --> 2528.18
that I haven't come thought of it myself

2517.869 --> 2528.1800000000003
so you get 50 xp for your wizard class

2529.56 --> 2540.91
how much to level up now it is really is

2535.5 --> 2543.13
yeah it's brilliant it's like a really

2540.91 --> 2546.81
good realization out of nowhere and it's

2543.13 --> 2549.76
awesome and I'm yeah I'd be proud of it

2546.81 --> 2551.5299999999997
if I were you but let's just see where

2549.76 --> 2555.25
it goes first first you got to get some

2551.53 --> 2556.9900000000002
actual content yeah to fill it but yeah

2555.25 --> 2559.3
I think you really are onto something

2556.99 --> 2561.5989999999997
like the moment you said it is just hit

2559.3 --> 2566.4900000000002
me like oh damn you're right

2561.599 --> 2571.4500000000003
so yeah why didn't I see that before

2566.49 --> 2578.89
let's see I mean next year Feb like

2571.45 --> 2585.1299999999997
let's see January 2019 let's see the

2578.89 --> 2588.19
distance to it it autumn it's 180

2585.13 --> 2593.2200000000003
kilometers I will have to wait until

2588.19 --> 2597.069
Mars will be like 50 million kilometers

2593.22 --> 2597.79
to the distance 50 million kilometres to

2597.069 --> 2600.42
earth

2597.79 --> 2607.98
and it will take a lot of time damn it

2600.42 --> 2612.9
when they say it will be so let's see ya

2607.98 --> 2615.96
2020 I think will be the closest so hmm

2612.9 --> 2619.0
yeah I think it will be a long project

2615.96 --> 2620.95
how long it's at least within reach you

2619.0 --> 2622.56
don't have to like wait five years for

2620.95 --> 2625.33
it or something like with the Eclipse

2622.56 --> 2631.45
yeah maybe maybe I will find other

2625.33 --> 2636.31
suppose planets too about Venus Venus

2631.45 --> 2638.95
Venus hello it should also be differing

2636.31 --> 2642.85
in distance and every morning you have

2638.95 --> 2646.48
this insane phenomena where it brightens

2642.85 --> 2649.7799999999997
up almost like a miniature Sun so get

2646.48 --> 2657.25
some close fuse of that absolutely

2649.78 --> 2662.5
fascinating yeah how that works out like

2657.25 --> 2666.25
it should change at like around 6 like

2662.5 --> 2670.3
yes 6 times the diameter size at the

2666.25 --> 2674.05
angular size I mean wow my things over a

2670.3 --> 2676.9
period specifically and like every

2674.05 --> 2679.21
morning where it starts out super bright

2676.9 --> 2682.39
almost like a miniature Sun and then

2679.21 --> 2688.66
just dims down and becomes like a

2682.39 --> 2693.31
regular star yeah I think the night sky

2688.66 --> 2699.1
has a lot of mysteries we somehow have

2693.31 --> 2702.0099999999998
to on solve right it's kind of sad that

2699.1 --> 2704.7999999999997
they all did that they gave us this

2702.01 --> 2708.9700000000003
model and people stopped looking into

2704.8 --> 2714.1600000000003
the sky that stopped trying to find out

2708.97 --> 2716.9199999999996
what those things really are right they

2714.16 --> 2720.73
they gave us a world which supposedly

2716.92 --> 2725.83
works and they took the curiosity away

2720.73 --> 2727.84
from people just like that and yeah they

2725.83 --> 2730.06
know they know how it works they know

2727.84 --> 2731.29
how the things behave so why should you

2730.06 --> 2737.11
look at that

2731.29 --> 2740.22
yeah yeah it is remarkable how that

2737.11 --> 2744.54
works but it is kind of a luxury problem

2740.22 --> 2748.8999999999996
but yeah a luxury can be a false luxury

2744.54 --> 2753.55
you can be made to feel extremely rich

2748.9 --> 2755.98
with something with beads potentially if

2753.55 --> 2758.65
that is for some significant reason

2755.98 --> 2761.56
valuable considered in a culture and

2758.65 --> 2763.75
everyone can have them while at the same

2761.56 --> 2767.41
time your country is being plundered but

2763.75 --> 2770.23
everybody's so happy with the beads that

2767.41 --> 2771.3999999999996
yeah they don't think about it him see

2770.23 --> 2775.63
what's happening

2771.4 --> 2777.46
so yeah luxury problems if you think you

2775.63 --> 2780.61
know it all then you're not going to be

2777.46 --> 2783.42
curious and this is even in the small

2780.61 --> 2785.8
scale visible with teenagers

2783.42 --> 2789.52
specifically teenagers and also

2785.8 --> 2793.75
generally stupid people that do have

2789.52 --> 2795.63
energy now they will typically the

2793.75 --> 2798.67
dumbest people will typically be

2795.63 --> 2800.55
extremely nauseating the arrogant

2798.67 --> 2803.38
thinking that they know everything

2800.55 --> 2808.03
that's one of the first symptoms of true

2803.38 --> 2809.94
stupidity is that they brag with an

2808.03 --> 2812.53
image that they know everything it's

2809.94 --> 2815.35
absolutely not what a real intelligent

2812.53 --> 2822.01
person tends to do unless you're on

2815.35 --> 2826.33
drugs or something so so yeah that's the

2822.01 --> 2829.2400000000002
same effect mm-hmm you allow people to

2826.33 --> 2833.17
think that they know everything then

2829.24 --> 2836.79
they're not gonna learn anything oh yeah

2833.17 --> 2839.17
we we got other people we can ask him

2836.79 --> 2844.45
yeah you're right

2839.17 --> 2847.1800000000003
oh the Mick says Venus change Venus toss

2844.45 --> 2850.0
change in size and sixth time is not

2847.18 --> 2854.19
accurate at all for [ __ ] sake how much

2850.0 --> 2859.54
is accurate then I'm just asking because

2854.19 --> 2860.9500000000003
he made the claim now and I as official

2859.54 --> 2864.38
sources tell me

2860.95 --> 2870.14
Venus changes six times

2864.38 --> 2875.089
in right like here I can even kind of

2870.14 --> 2880.339
post a link HS in the side chat out

2875.089 --> 2887.8089999999997
posted in the in the YouTube yet yeah so

2880.339 --> 2892.0389999999998
here is the anger here is what the anger

2887.809 --> 2896.9300000000003
size of the planet should be and the

2892.039 --> 2898.9100000000003
difference in angular size right so here

2896.93 --> 2902.239
is even how you can calculate this and

2898.91 --> 2905.3289999999997
everything it's a it's Wikipedia I think

2902.239 --> 2909.559
both loopers kinda take it as a

2905.329 --> 2914.0890000000004
trustworthy source then you can see

2909.559 --> 2917.739
Venus who which has this orange bar

2914.089 --> 2922.43
under that one and then you can see the

2917.739 --> 2933.43
angular that matter or our size it is in

2922.43 --> 2937.3999999999996
arcminutes it seems right that's

2933.43 --> 2942.229
convenient data let's see if it's true

2937.4 --> 2946.19
yeah I mean all everything we they claim

2942.229 --> 2948.259
we should be able to confirm if anything

2946.19 --> 2951.68
isn't confirmable that means that their

2948.259 --> 2955.099
model doesn't work and if everything

2951.68 --> 2960.319
really matches reality how it looks like

2955.099 --> 2963.4990000000003
in the sky regarding the supposed planet

2960.319 --> 2966.68
and so I think dude good to go chop

2963.499 --> 2970.7889999999998
dudes because it is hard to make up a

2966.68 --> 2975.3689999999997
system model which what's really 100

2970.789 --> 2982.099
percent match reality to regarding the

2975.369 --> 2984.619
delights in the sky right let's see it

2982.099 --> 2987.259
will take a long it will take a lot of

2984.619 --> 2990.1400000000003
time maybe I can find three allowable

2987.259 --> 2993.079
sources from other people I know who did

2990.14 --> 2996.489
something similar or did the same with

2993.079 --> 2996.489
right of course another reason

2997.63 --> 3002.25
it's not gonna take so long is if you're

2999.339 --> 3005.24
gonna study Venus in the morning and

3002.25 --> 3008.22
just see how it changes in its daily

3005.24 --> 3010.89
apparition there's a release that's

3008.22 --> 3013.1699999999996
pretty that could be every day or at

3010.89 --> 3017.4
least every day so during certain

3013.17 --> 3022.349
seasons so it shouldn't be too difficult

3017.4 --> 3026.069
to wait on as it's a daily occurrence so

3022.349 --> 3027.599
during one night Venus on their models

3026.069 --> 3032.269
shouldn't change in angular size at all

3027.599 --> 3035.9700000000003
right because one night isn't enough to

3032.269 --> 3038.1299999999997
to to travel such distances that the

3035.97 --> 3041.91
angular size should even be noticeable

3038.13 --> 3044.19
to change so on and you said you

3041.91 --> 3048.8089999999997
observed Venus changing an angular size

3044.19 --> 3050.789
right Tori during the night insane or it

3048.809 --> 3055.94
starts out pretty much insane in the

3050.789 --> 3060.7200000000003
morning there's even old legends or old

3055.94 --> 3063.15
stories I guess fables about yeah it's

3060.72 --> 3068.3999999999996
the morning star they call it or the

3063.15 --> 3071.579
morning star or the because it could

3068.4 --> 3074.339
technically be mistaken if during a

3071.579 --> 3076.65
certain period to be the Sun coming up

3074.339 --> 3080.19
and that's at the horizon because it's

3076.65 --> 3083.19
so bright but yes when it goes up it's

3080.19 --> 3085.98
just too small and like a mini Sun and

3083.19 --> 3090.9
then a real Sun comes up and the

3085.98 --> 3094.17
brightness goes away gradually of Venus

3090.9 --> 3096.2690000000002
so but that's a daily morning phenomena

3094.17 --> 3102.7200000000003
it's why why it's nicknamed the morning

3096.269 --> 3106.79
star yeah all right I very fascinating

3102.72 --> 3108.2
phenomena and it's it's not uncommon

3106.79 --> 3110.88
[Music]

3108.2 --> 3112.25
curious to see how they explain that

3110.88 --> 3116.88
phenomena

3112.25 --> 3121.799
maybe with some other garbage explain

3116.88 --> 3124.4100000000003
because the intense gas of Venus that's

3121.799 --> 3128.549
this unique spectral effect when the

3124.41 --> 3130.8089999999997
sunlight shines past it it reflects kind

3128.549 --> 3132.64
of like a bright light

3130.809 --> 3134.1090000000004
on the earth that's probably what

3132.64 --> 3136.39
they're gonna say because typically yeah

3134.109 --> 3140.319
it does happen in the morning right

3136.39 --> 3143.3799999999997
before the Sun and then you can reason

3140.319 --> 3146.589
it out I think it's probably gonna be

3143.38 --> 3151.2690000000002
something like that because Venus is

3146.589 --> 3157.919
supposedly a like a very hot and gaseous

3151.269 --> 3173.4089999999997
planet like with a lot of clouds yeah

3157.919 --> 3175.919
yeah just garbage do it I mean it's kind

3173.409 --> 3181.329
of interesting because you would have I

3175.919 --> 3183.549
mean to disprove them in their own model

3181.329 --> 3187.049
you kind of have to let them back the

3183.549 --> 3189.13
question like 1000 times right like

3187.049 --> 3191.259
they're nothing back the question that

3189.13 --> 3197.289
those things are actually planning back

3191.259 --> 3202.89
the question if you take one card away

3197.289 --> 3206.409
it just crashes into itself and yeah I

3202.89 --> 3210.5789999999997
think this is why they had to back the

3206.409 --> 3213.969
questions like 1000 times or more to

3210.579 --> 3216.699
build even a higher and higher house of

3213.969 --> 3218.679
cards with morale normalized begging the

3216.699 --> 3220.949
question and they did successfully they

3218.679 --> 3223.119
normalized it in the scientific circles

3220.949 --> 3227.199
not mentioning it and then they

3223.119 --> 3230.829
culturally introduced it in social

3227.199 --> 3233.289
culture like people started using these

3230.829 --> 3235.3590000000004
arguments and it was accepted so people

3233.289 --> 3239.949
started then copying the mechanism and

3235.359 --> 3242.64
now it's become okay to presuppose to

3239.949 --> 3245.7690000000002
assume to fantasize and it they're even

3242.64 --> 3249.3689999999997
trying to move that border even further

3245.769 --> 3251.14
into straight out insanity but yeah

3249.369 --> 3254.9790000000003
that's a cultural thing that's been

3251.14 --> 3258.3689999999997
placed alongside the technical science

3254.979 --> 3262.259
scientism it's a cultural thing my

3258.369 --> 3262.259
opinion yeah I agree

3264.12 --> 3273.8399999999997
it's basically the begging the question

3266.54 --> 3275.82
culture allowing fantasizing in official

3273.84 --> 3280.83
thinking in official reasoning and

3275.82 --> 3282.57
that's just wrong yeah uh all

3280.83 --> 3285.2999999999997
philosophers would be turning in their

3282.57 --> 3287.28
graves if they see how some people

3285.3 --> 3291.8100000000004
conduct themselves intellectually in

3287.28 --> 3296.7900000000004
this world yeah it's kind of sad isn't

3291.81 --> 3300.63
it um so I think wait a moment it's

3296.79 --> 3303.81
kinda all right I have to leave again

3300.63 --> 3307.35
for I think the troll yeah I was gonna

3303.81 --> 3309.33
be showers okay it's in there thank you

3387.24 --> 3392.16
out the show after this I'm gonna go to

3389.37 --> 3394.65
the Flat Earth debates oops I think it

3392.16 --> 3397.3799999999997
just started so thank you everyone for

3394.65 --> 3397.89
