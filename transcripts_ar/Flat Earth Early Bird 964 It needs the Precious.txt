125.579 --> 130.34
when it was pretty much raining and

127.92 --> 130.34
pouring

132.66 --> 139.52
I went out for groceries with an

134.76 --> 139.51999999999998
umbrella I was very glad that I did

142.8 --> 145.5

150.72 --> 155.879
background well yeah

152.519 --> 159.56
it really poured hard

155.879 --> 159.56
after that for like hours

163.92 --> 168.98

181.44 --> 187.319
the 25th

184.739 --> 189.18
right so yeah it was yesterday so when

187.319 --> 191.22
we were getting this big splash over

189.18 --> 194.34
here in the Netherlands apparently in

191.22 --> 195.599
London they got it too so hard actually

194.34 --> 199.26
that

195.599 --> 202.76
Metro stations and streets

199.26 --> 202.76
like completely flooded

203.22 --> 209.4
I only know this because RT reported on

205.98 --> 213.29899999999998
it didn't see it anywhere else

209.4 --> 215.64000000000001

235.739 --> 240.62
Nathan just announced he's not having a

237.9 --> 240.62
live stream again

241.14 --> 246.17999999999998
ah

243.42 --> 248.89999999999998

256.739 --> 263.12
so yeah I guess I'll have to

260.34 --> 263.11999999999995
take over

264.18 --> 272.479
all right anyway it is Monday the 26th

269.04 --> 272.47900000000004
of July 2021

277.08 --> 279.25899999999996
foreign

281.66 --> 287.34000000000003
right it's 22 degrees

284.699 --> 289.88
right now it's not even that much warmer

287.34 --> 289.88
hmm

290.82 --> 294.62
it does feel a lot warmer though

295.32 --> 299.06
71 humidity

299.1 --> 306.08000000000004
anyway hello drunken bullet 4-1-1 good

302.34 --> 306.08
to see you Susan Pryor

306.539 --> 311.28
New Zealand yeah it's it's late in New

309.6 --> 314.53900000000004
Zealand right now

311.28 --> 314.539
good evening to you

330.0 --> 332.6
all right

334.5 --> 338.72
I skipped on the notes again

341.46 --> 344.29999999999995
mm-hmm

348.419 --> 352.039
let me redo that quick

353.22 --> 357.66
yeah I watched my show back yesterday

355.62 --> 360.24
twice

357.66 --> 362.46000000000004
I thought it was probably one of my best

360.24 --> 366.90000000000003
shows this year

362.46 --> 366.9
concerning all things fluidity

370.199 --> 376.38
and yeah I put down a lot of esoterics

373.86 --> 378.47900000000004
very proud of that

376.38 --> 380.9
it was a really good stream I thought

378.479 --> 380.9
yesterday

383.88 --> 391.34
later on today I watched some Rambo

388.38 --> 391.34
old stuff

395.46 --> 402.29999999999995
it yeah just to check it out like okay

399.06 --> 405.62
how is this manipulative and there's a

402.3 --> 405.62
lot of manipulation in there

406.259 --> 412.91900000000004
like Behavioral

408.56 --> 416.039
Impressions like Rambo is a really weird

412.919 --> 419.78
liberal movie

416.039 --> 419.78
it is a really weird one

423.419 --> 426.68
hello Michael Kong

429.66 --> 434.46000000000004
get this flat no matter what the time

431.46 --> 434.46
yeah

436.46 --> 443.96
the time it's basically a Celestial

440.34 --> 443.96
oriented convention anyway

444.0 --> 446.18
foreign

475.099 --> 481.319
so anyway yeah I

478.86 --> 485.06
managed to figure out another title card

481.319 --> 485.06
and with them help of Adam making

486.84 --> 491.69899999999996
I got a good title card for today with

489.3 --> 493.919
the title it doesn't really directly

491.699 --> 496.379
relate to anything

493.919 --> 499.31899999999996
except for well everything I've talked

496.379 --> 500.22
about and the esoterics of it I don't

499.319 --> 501.90000000000003
know

500.22 --> 504.59900000000005
it's just another one for the series

501.9 --> 506.81899999999996
it's like I'm starting to notice a

504.599 --> 509.539
specific pattern in how I make these

506.819 --> 509.53900000000004
title cards

510.12 --> 515.539
or rather how yeah how I think them up

516.0 --> 520.279
and how meat atomy can put some together

520.74 --> 524.9590000000001
because he he does the font and

522.719 --> 524.9590000000001
everything

526.94 --> 532.2790000000001
hmm

528.48 --> 532.279
hello AGM good to see you

538.56 --> 544.5189999999999
so right yeah if you

541.5 --> 544.519
have urges

544.98 --> 548.36
if you need the precious

548.459 --> 552.14
then we can talk about that

552.18 --> 554.66
right

558.58 --> 561.7090000000001
[Music]

564.839 --> 569.94
so yeah we can do Flat Earth I could go

568.08 --> 571.5600000000001
against a couple of trolls as soon as

569.94 --> 574.44
they roll in again

571.56 --> 577.6199999999999
always keeps things rolling or

574.44 --> 579.36
could get into other detailed subjects

577.62 --> 582.74
or

579.36 --> 582.74
yeah whatever you guys like

583.98 --> 590.04
oh by the way I did yesterday

587.88 --> 593.1
Quantum of conscious had like this micro

590.04 --> 594.36
stream and apparently that was only like

593.1 --> 598.5600000000001
a

594.36 --> 600.839
an ad stream for his own website I

598.56 --> 603.1999999999999
never really looked into that before

600.839 --> 603.2
that

603.24 --> 610.5
on freevoice.io

606.6 --> 613.44
and yeah he does have what it seems like

610.5 --> 615.36
more complete streams over there

613.44 --> 618.62
with some more footage as well so it's

615.36 --> 618.62
his own platform

620.519 --> 625.62
so I think that in the future I will

623.04 --> 629.04
just start to watch his videos on there

625.62 --> 630.42
and kind of use YouTube as a reminder of

629.04 --> 632.399
his streams

630.42 --> 634.3199999999999
like many people do that have their own

632.399 --> 638.3
platforms

634.32 --> 638.3000000000001
out there outside of YouTube

645.72 --> 648.72
hmm

669.839 --> 675.1800000000001
Matt sends an email First videos 100

673.26 --> 679.74
free

675.18 --> 683.16
uh sure Jared Sanford but I don't need

679.74 --> 686.22
my email to get reminded of streams

683.16 --> 688.76
he still uploads his streams on YouTube

686.22 --> 688.76
so

698.519 --> 704.88
like uh

701.6 --> 707.519
lift the veil Nathan Stopman kind of did

704.88 --> 712.9399999999999
that himself for a long time because he

707.519 --> 712.94
had a lot of Crackdown on his works

713.94 --> 718.3800000000001
so he often did that just short micro

716.459 --> 720.18
streams

718.38 --> 724.22
and then saying okay I'm going to

720.18 --> 724.2199999999999
continue on another platform and

726.36 --> 728.839
again

729.72 --> 733.5600000000001
he's kind of left YouTube for a long

731.639 --> 736.399
time and he went on to

733.56 --> 736.399
[ __ ] shoot

741.899 --> 745.76
all right so I've seen it before

751.5 --> 757.98
you think about thousands dying from the

754.019 --> 757.98
big sea [ __ ] yeah

758.399 --> 765.42
oh well what is there to think about

760.92 --> 768.12
it's it's everywhere it's just

765.42 --> 770.399
you really have to make effort to escape

768.12 --> 772.5600000000001
that realization by now

770.399 --> 774.779
it's so all over the news that even

772.56 --> 777.7199999999999
mainstream platforms kind of secretly

774.779 --> 780.38
hint towards it

777.72 --> 780.38
so

785.82 --> 790.32
all right because there's just reports

787.98 --> 792.98
coming out that people that actually

790.32 --> 796.38
have taken it

792.98 --> 798.9590000000001
get sick more

796.38 --> 801.899
statistically

798.959 --> 805.3199999999999
and when they get

801.899 --> 807.42
the presupposed disease

805.32 --> 809.5790000000001
they get it worse

807.42 --> 811.8199999999999
right that's data that's already coming

809.579 --> 811.8199999999999
out

812.339 --> 818.2790000000001
so yeah everybody that's going to be

814.079 --> 820.1389999999999
taking it is is going to be blind like

818.279 --> 823.16
nobody in their right mind would

820.139 --> 823.16
consider doing this

825.18 --> 831.779
right they're literally using it as a

828.6 --> 834.32
lollipop to wave over our heads

831.779 --> 837.72
like oh you can get all this special

834.32 --> 839.279
things that you can are allowed to do if

837.72 --> 842.1600000000001
you just take it

839.279 --> 844.8
yeah well

842.16 --> 847.199
get that for somebody completely

844.8 --> 848.639
uninformed that must be very appealing

847.199 --> 850.9799999999999
to them

848.639 --> 852.899
but yeah they should realize it is

850.98 --> 856.5790000000001
probably one of the most poisonous

852.899 --> 856.579
lollipops ever handed out

858.42 --> 861.3199999999999
so

861.54 --> 866.54
yeah

863.399 --> 866.54
yeah not worth it

876.959 --> 881.04
grow triple seven is having his own side

879.06 --> 885.199
I'm not surprised about that

881.04 --> 885.199
I mean the guy's been going for so long

906.54 --> 911.399
right you had depending on what the

909.06 --> 912.8389999999999
costs would be in like how this all

911.399 --> 915.06
really works

912.839 --> 916.44
at this point I wouldn't mind having my

915.06 --> 920.18
own

916.44 --> 920.1800000000001
website who knows

922.38 --> 926.6
because yeah for anybody that thinks

925.079 --> 929.279
that I'm like

926.6 --> 932.4590000000001
insistently here on YouTube I'm like

929.279 --> 934.86
defending YouTube from The Exodus well

932.459 --> 938.8199999999999
you're wrong about that I'm just really

934.86 --> 941.0600000000001
tenacious I I chose to put my route in

938.82 --> 941.0600000000001
here

942.18 --> 949.92
and yeah I'm not easy to

946.019 --> 952.98
step away again I built a lot here

949.92 --> 955.5
like I built up here and I know I can

952.98 --> 957.54
just like cut it off

955.5 --> 958.8
and continue somewhere else and it would

957.54 --> 961.139
be good

958.8 --> 963.959
it's just that I got a lot of recorded

961.139 --> 968.0600000000001
history here of my activities like

963.959 --> 968.06
within the Awakening Cycles

970.199 --> 975.3599999999999
and I got so many videos now I would

973.32 --> 977.94
know how to like

975.36 --> 981.66
ship them all downloaded all and then

977.94 --> 984.1800000000001
put it on like a separate website I

981.66 --> 986.279
it sounds to me

984.18 --> 988.8599999999999
somebody that doesn't actually know the

986.279 --> 992.36
prices of it all sounds like an extra

988.86 --> 992.36
extremely expensive project

992.94 --> 997.139
so that's why it hasn't been like

995.94 --> 1000.32
like

997.139 --> 1003.38
really close by

1000.32 --> 1005.779
like oh I'm gonna do that soon and it's

1003.38 --> 1009.82
like no I I don't know how I don't know

1005.779 --> 1009.82
how I don't know if it'll help me

1010.639 --> 1016.22
like because is it literally YouTube

1013.399 --> 1018.199
that's been holding me back is it is it

1016.22 --> 1019.94
actually YouTube that's holding me back

1018.199 --> 1022.779
right it's part of why I asked the

1019.94 --> 1022.7790000000001
questions yesterday

1024.02 --> 1027.86
like do people

1026.0 --> 1031.299
maybe think

1027.86 --> 1031.299
because I'm so

1032.14 --> 1037.4
reluctant to step away from the YouTube

1034.699 --> 1041.26
platform that I'm somehow like part of

1037.4 --> 1041.26
partly Google shill or something

1043.579 --> 1049.28
because I'm not

1046.28 --> 1052.82
but I am aware of like

1049.28 --> 1056.0
what it is what it's doing and how it's

1052.82 --> 1060.559
manipulating everything including me

1056.0 --> 1063.44
and I'm trying to play through it

1060.559 --> 1064.52
and still maintain as much Freedom as I

1063.44 --> 1067.9
can

1064.52 --> 1067.9
possibly maintain

1068.84 --> 1075.74
but hey if I need to get out of here

1071.419 --> 1078.6200000000001
like leave YouTube Forever

1075.74 --> 1080.48
to be taken seriously like well like

1078.62 --> 1083.059
who's gonna take me seriously that

1080.48 --> 1085.7
aren't right now because

1083.059 --> 1087.9189999999999
that would be crazy

1085.7 --> 1090.679
in a way it's like because I'm on

1087.919 --> 1092.7800000000002
YouTube you can't take it serious

1090.679 --> 1094.88
right so you're going to take it serious

1092.78 --> 1097.6399999999999
when I go separate or you're just going

1094.88 --> 1100.7600000000002
to be very happy that you'll never have

1097.64 --> 1102.919
to bump into me ever again

1100.76 --> 1105.919
right but that's

1102.919 --> 1108.3200000000002
I don't think it's it's like that maybe

1105.919 --> 1111.38
for some gamma trolls right they'll be

1108.32 --> 1115.46
relieved like oh finally no more Flat

1111.38 --> 1117.2600000000002
Earth live show on YouTube

1115.46 --> 1119.44
but yeah who gives a [ __ ] what they

1117.26 --> 1119.44
think

1132.5 --> 1139.58
you're the proof of manipulation taking

1135.26 --> 1143.14
place of how honesty is censored no

1139.58 --> 1143.1399999999999
it not really

1148.88 --> 1154.4
I mean yeah I did get that strike sword

1152.179 --> 1157.22
of strike warning strike on that video

1154.4 --> 1158.96
that got removed from a little over a

1157.22 --> 1160.58
week ago

1158.96 --> 1164.059
right

1160.58 --> 1167.26
but yeah that can be very easily traced

1164.059 --> 1167.26
to the rules

1167.419 --> 1175.2800000000002
and other than that I look have I been

1171.64 --> 1176.7990000000002
held back like I know sorry I can't say

1175.28 --> 1180.44
these things because it's YouTube

1176.799 --> 1183.9189999999999
there's other people out there that do

1180.44 --> 1186.679
that constantly and yeah Quantum of

1183.919 --> 1189.38
conscious is one of them live to feel

1186.679 --> 1192.5
Nathan Stoltman absolutely one of them

1189.38 --> 1194.7800000000002
they constantly try to like completely

1192.5 --> 1196.94
rearrange words in order to escape

1194.78 --> 1200.559
censorship

1196.94 --> 1200.559
have I really done that

1200.6 --> 1205.24
have I altered the names

1206.48 --> 1212.14
like in a consistent way to try to avoid

1209.96 --> 1217.58
being

1212.14 --> 1221.24
flagged for censorship no no I have not

1217.58 --> 1223.82
I still don't I still just call it what

1221.24 --> 1226.039
it is in the moment

1223.82 --> 1229.22
my videos are still there

1226.039 --> 1231.86
most of them like how many shows now

1229.22 --> 1234.2
have passed where I haven't talked about

1231.86 --> 1238.039
the virus

1234.2 --> 1240.98
at all a single time in the last month

1238.039 --> 1244.039
I can't remember a single one I can't

1240.98 --> 1247.1
remember a single live show I did where

1244.039 --> 1248.78
I did not at least address it once

1247.1 --> 1251.299
just for the simple fact that somebody

1248.78 --> 1256.82
in chat would ask about it

1251.299 --> 1258.26
talked about it every single day

1256.82 --> 1260.12
saying it

1258.26 --> 1263.9
what it is

1260.12 --> 1265.8799999999999
and none of my videos get this warning

1263.9 --> 1268.7
thing

1265.88 --> 1270.2
except for when it is blatantly in the

1268.7 --> 1273.2
title

1270.2 --> 1276.0800000000002
I don't even think that

1273.2 --> 1278.6000000000001
the nitpicky moderators

1276.08 --> 1281.36
I don't think they even watch my show

1278.6 --> 1283.52
they just go as far as the title and

1281.36 --> 1286.6999999999998
that's it

1283.52 --> 1289.1
unless somebody really

1286.7 --> 1291.6200000000001
specific like some gamma watches and

1289.1 --> 1293.36
really finds like oh he really went over

1291.62 --> 1295.2199999999998
the line there

1293.36 --> 1297.62
and then they

1295.22 --> 1300.26
might look into it most of the time they

1297.62 --> 1303.62
don't even watch it they don't check it

1300.26 --> 1307.1589999999999
they don't check my show

1303.62 --> 1310.1589999999999
to actually see if I violate the

1307.159 --> 1313.4
supposed rules that are very tough if if

1310.159 --> 1316.159
they're all upheld it's very tough to do

1313.4 --> 1319.46
anything on YouTube right

1316.159 --> 1321.2600000000002
it's not happening I just say it I just

1319.46 --> 1323.96
talk about it it I'm not getting

1321.26 --> 1327.74
censored unless I really really push it

1323.96 --> 1329.96
by putting it in the title

1327.74 --> 1332.84
do you see

1329.96 --> 1335.419
do you see do people in chat right now

1332.84 --> 1337.6589999999999
do you see this do you understand it's

1335.419 --> 1337.659
different

1340.82 --> 1346.6399999999999
and I've been very critical of YouTube

1343.46 --> 1348.919
of Google of like their managing

1346.64 --> 1351.38
techniques for the platform of the

1348.919 --> 1354.8600000000001
technical makeup of the interfaces

1351.38 --> 1354.8600000000001
everything critical

1356.84 --> 1363.08
and they still just leave me doing what

1359.9 --> 1366.14
I do right so it's not like I have this

1363.08 --> 1368.4189999999999
massive push in the back incentive to

1366.14 --> 1370.64
like oh my God I really need to leave

1368.419 --> 1373.159
YouTube because I can't say anything or

1370.64 --> 1376.5200000000002
they'll censor me

1373.159 --> 1377.96
it's not happening it isn't

1376.52 --> 1380.1399999999999
so why

1377.96 --> 1383.799
why

1380.14 --> 1383.7990000000002
isn't that happening

1384.5 --> 1389.36
I'm wondering how many people are asking

1386.96 --> 1392.539
this question

1389.36 --> 1394.8799999999999
or if they're just so flustered that it

1392.539 --> 1398.299
isn't happening that they don't even

1394.88 --> 1400.5800000000002
want to look into me what I do and why

1398.299 --> 1402.74
I'm not getting censored

1400.58 --> 1404.84
maybe they'll just immediately take it

1402.74 --> 1406.34
as like there's only one reason why he's

1404.84 --> 1409.22
not getting censored and that's because

1406.34 --> 1413.12
he's less than 2 000 subscriber Channel

1409.22 --> 1415.46
and literally nobody gives a [ __ ]

1413.12 --> 1419.78
right maybe that's the response maybe

1415.46 --> 1422.8400000000001
that is even the purpose

1419.78 --> 1426.7
why Google deals with my activities on

1422.84 --> 1426.6999999999998
YouTube as they do I don't know

1427.58 --> 1432.62
I don't know

1429.26 --> 1435.559
every time I ask because I even talk

1432.62 --> 1438.1399999999999
about this on freaking Nathan Oakley's

1435.559 --> 1440.9189999999999
live show I say it like I don't know why

1438.14 --> 1442.48
I'm not getting censored

1440.919 --> 1447.98
nobody

1442.48 --> 1451.46
addresses it nobody addresses it why

1447.98 --> 1455.0
does nobody address it nobody addresses

1451.46 --> 1458.179
it there's unusual management going on

1455.0 --> 1461.539
here and I don't know why

1458.179 --> 1464.48
and nobody addresses it and it's getting

1461.539 --> 1467.9
really on my nerves why is nobody

1464.48 --> 1470.419
addressing this unusual situation

1467.9 --> 1471.919
why does nobody respond when I talk

1470.419 --> 1473.24
about what you think I'm attention

1471.919 --> 1475.88
grabby

1473.24 --> 1478.46
for bringing it up well every [ __ ]

1475.88 --> 1480.0800000000002
body out there brings it up right and

1478.46 --> 1483.26
everybody could talk about when somebody

1480.08 --> 1484.46
else gets answered well when I mention I

1483.26 --> 1488.6589999999999
don't understand

1484.46 --> 1490.7
why why I'm getting this freedom

1488.659 --> 1494.72
from this Beast

1490.7 --> 1497.24
machine I don't understand why

1494.72 --> 1500.02
nobody addresses it it's starting to

1497.24 --> 1500.02
piss me off

1500.08 --> 1504.02
like the fact that nobody's addressing

1503.299 --> 1507.58
it

1504.02 --> 1507.58
nobody's addressing me

1508.279 --> 1515.779
and my situation and how unusual it is

1512.6 --> 1518.48
or how about just how unusual I am as a

1515.779 --> 1519.44
person and things I roll out my aura

1518.48 --> 1521.9
cling

1519.44 --> 1526.059
my channeling including dark things

1521.9 --> 1526.0590000000002
everything I Channel it all

1526.94 --> 1532.76
and I tried to prevent that Darkness

1529.52 --> 1535.22
from slipping through and allowing other

1532.76 --> 1537.679
dark resonating people from doing more

1535.22 --> 1539.059
damage I'm actually doing it to try to

1537.679 --> 1543.02
reach them to

1539.059 --> 1546.08
step out of that Darkness first resonate

1543.02 --> 1548.4189999999999
on the same frequency then reveal the

1546.08 --> 1550.6399999999999
desperation from their sights to

1548.419 --> 1552.44
themselves and then show them practical

1550.64 --> 1555.64
steps they can take to get out of it

1552.44 --> 1559.039
yeah it's part of what I do

1555.64 --> 1562.3400000000001
nobody's talking about it nobody

1559.039 --> 1566.9
nobody's talking about it

1562.34 --> 1568.48
all I get is gamma troll whining

1566.9 --> 1571.779
and like

1568.48 --> 1574.46
why don't you address Randy

1571.779 --> 1578.24
that sort of [ __ ]

1574.46 --> 1583.419
and standard globe or Garbage rinse and

1578.24 --> 1583.419
repeats scatter gunning fallacy nonsense

1588.919 --> 1593.539
so I'm gonna look into chat if anybody

1591.08 --> 1597.559
is even listening to what I'm saying now

1593.539 --> 1600.679
or just lovely using my energy not

1597.559 --> 1603.08
listening to just ramble back and forth

1600.679 --> 1604.4
with one another about insignificant

1603.08 --> 1608.5
[ __ ]

1604.4 --> 1608.5
okay that sounds a little negative but

1616.279 --> 1621.62
be happy you can speak right oh I'm so

1618.74 --> 1624.98
happy I can speak and that nobody's

1621.62 --> 1629.059
talking about how unusual it is

1624.98 --> 1633.14
that my subscribers don't grow I'm still

1629.059 --> 1636.3799999999999
at the same amount it's not moving it's

1633.14 --> 1638.96
not growing my subscriber amount is not

1636.38 --> 1640.94
growing I have a Daily Show it's not

1638.96 --> 1642.679
growing oh yeah I get a little boost

1640.94 --> 1645.26
from Nathan Oakley for shouting me out

1642.679 --> 1647.48
and then I get like 10 subscribers

1645.26 --> 1649.94
and that's it

1647.48 --> 1653.1200000000001
yeah YouTube

1649.94 --> 1654.74
seven billion people I get 10

1653.12 --> 1656.779
subscribers

1654.74 --> 1659.539
yeah

1656.779 --> 1662.0
how about that but I don't get censored

1659.539 --> 1665.6
I can pretty much say whatever I want

1662.0 --> 1668.679
hey but I get no subscribers what is the

1665.6 --> 1668.6789999999999
freaking point of this

1680.0 --> 1683.38
I have a fan upstairs

1686.6 --> 1691.7199999999998
okay I don't know what that's supposed

1689.299 --> 1691.72
to mean

1695.059 --> 1700.22
what you think that the mega billionaire

1697.46 --> 1703.3990000000001
Elite Got a Boner for me or something

1700.22 --> 1706.1200000000001
or should I be happy about that

1703.399 --> 1706.12
should I

1711.62 --> 1716.6
yeah voynichello by the way long time no

1713.899 --> 1719.6789999999999
see yeah YouTube is therapy that's all

1716.6 --> 1719.6789999999999
very very nice

1725.539 --> 1734.179
the thing is though I'd like to have

1728.539 --> 1736.58
some more Rich I'd like people to

1734.179 --> 1739.94
feel the needs

1736.58 --> 1743.0
to advertise to actually say hey look

1739.94 --> 1748.279
there's this guy on YouTube who has a

1743.0 --> 1751.159
freaking show ever every day every day

1748.279 --> 1753.5
for years talking about Flat Earth

1751.159 --> 1756.0800000000002
really complicated [ __ ] and the

1753.5 --> 1759.2
technicals the science technicals and

1756.08 --> 1762.26
the presuppositions and the psychology

1759.2 --> 1764.419

1762.26 --> 1767.12
spiritual mechanics in a consistent

1764.419 --> 1769.76
fashion I'd like somebody to actually

1767.12 --> 1771.86
out there and I don't mean you guys in

1769.76 --> 1772.82
chat because I love you guys you're

1814.94 --> 1819.919

1855.799 --> 1861.26
lot of people like to talk about I

1858.019 --> 1863.36

1905.059 --> 1909.799
say that Nathan is and that's his choice

1907.34 --> 1912.3799999999999
and he's very good at it

1909.799 --> 1915.019

1912.38 --> 1919.1200000000001
amused by that yeah yeah

1915.019 --> 1919.1200000000001
that's not what I'm here for though

1920.6 --> 1926.24

1922.34 --> 1929.799
funniness and amusement value and like

1926.24 --> 1932.419

1929.799 --> 1934.039
concerning me just observing me like oh

1932.419 --> 1936.5
there's all these kinds of weird funny

1934.039 --> 1938.36
things about Arwin and he doesn't always

1936.5 --> 1941.24
notice that isn't that just kind of

1938.36 --> 1945.62
interesting that's all very entertaining

1941.24 --> 1946.64
how about the freaking subjects I talk

1945.62 --> 1948.5
about

1946.64 --> 1951.98
and how I do it

1948.5 --> 1953.779
yeah how about some connection

1951.98 --> 1957.5
oh you don't get it

1953.779 --> 1958.94
why don't you [ __ ] tell me you don't

1957.5 --> 1961.76
get it

1958.94 --> 1965.2
stop ignoring me

1961.76 --> 1965.2
address me

1972.679 --> 1977.26
put my name go to Martin's side what

1985.399 --> 1989.9599999999998
you mean Martin Luther side

1987.74 --> 1993.2
I don't know what I'd do there

1989.96 --> 1995.8990000000001
I mean if Martin wants me on his side

1993.2 --> 1999.74
sure I have my own alternative history

1995.899 --> 2001.7199999999998
ideas I have like a piece of it like I

1999.74 --> 2003.88
put down a piece even in the Flat Earth

2001.72 --> 2007.6000000000001
talks days and I've

2003.88 --> 2009.64
updated it and expanded upon the

2007.6 --> 2012.039
potential possibilities of how it all

2009.64 --> 2014.019
happened since then I update that story

2012.039 --> 2015.6589999999999
and I roll it whenever roll it out

2014.019 --> 2019.179
whenever it's brought up

2015.659 --> 2020.7990000000002
pyramids Giants out there intricately

2019.179 --> 2023.799
tied in

2020.799 --> 2027.1589999999999
all that how the how it was all built in

2023.799 --> 2029.44
what age it was built why it was built

2027.159 --> 2030.7600000000002
how long it was to go and how long it

2029.44 --> 2032.38
wasn't

2030.76 --> 2033.8799999999999
etc etc

2032.38 --> 2037.3600000000001
sure

2033.88 --> 2040.659
if he wants me to be part of that on his

2037.36 --> 2043.24
side that's fine

2040.659 --> 2046.0
where on a very different functioning

2043.24 --> 2049.119
level though

2046.0 --> 2053.139
I mean Martin overall is much more more

2049.119 --> 2055.3
of a scatter Gunner he just has piles

2053.139 --> 2057.579
and piles and piles and piles and piles

2055.3 --> 2059.619
of data and footage and he just likes to

2057.579 --> 2062.32
throw it at the screen and just talk

2059.619 --> 2064.8990000000003
about whatever comes up to him right and

2062.32 --> 2067.3590000000004
that's fine it has its function

2064.899 --> 2069.879
it's not very consistent in many ways

2067.359 --> 2072.2799999999997
but it has its function I don't do that

2069.879 --> 2075.339
actually when I'm in his streams when

2072.28 --> 2078.46
you do that I constantly point out like

2075.339 --> 2079.54
ah this is not this is CGI this is a

2078.46 --> 2082.0
painting

2079.54 --> 2086.74
no that's not mud flood

2082.0 --> 2089.2
uh that's yeah I do that I'm

2086.74 --> 2091.4799999999996
a little bit artistic like that I do

2089.2 --> 2092.98
that I have to do that right so maybe he

2091.48 --> 2095.639
doesn't want me on his side ever

2092.98 --> 2098.859
considered that I don't need

2095.639 --> 2102.28
specifically Martin to add me on this

2098.859 --> 2104.92
side but if he wants to

2102.28 --> 2107.38
if he wants to connect other than just

2104.92 --> 2109.96
old Bros and we are old Bros me and

2107.38 --> 2113.1400000000003
Martin little literally go way back to

2109.96 --> 2115.32
my very very first live stream he was on

2113.14 --> 2115.3199999999997
it

2115.42 --> 2120.46
so and he recognized it and when I'm in

2118.359 --> 2122.3199999999997
the chat on the stream then he does

2120.46 --> 2125.2200000000003
shout me and he does respect me I really

2122.32 --> 2125.2200000000003
appreciate that

2125.32 --> 2131.099
that's cool when I

2128.56 --> 2131.099
we

2131.94 --> 2136.54
internet

2133.5 --> 2139.98
disrupted the flow of my talk again

2136.54 --> 2139.98
isn't that just cute

2141.099 --> 2143.76
all right

2151.66 --> 2156.46
so

2153.94 --> 2159.16
yeah what is it about Martin Luther that

2156.46 --> 2163.44
he has what is it like

2159.16 --> 2163.44
a lot of subscribers

2164.02 --> 2168.24
what is it like tens of thousands

2168.88 --> 2174.28
they know who I am they know what I do

2171.579 --> 2176.94
and yet I can't even get 2 000

2174.28 --> 2176.94
subscribers

2177.76 --> 2186.76
I mean yeah I've grown like what is it

2181.0 --> 2190.0
maybe 50 subscribers in a year of every

2186.76 --> 2192.2200000000003
day live streaming every day no

2190.0 --> 2195.52
exception a year

2192.22 --> 2198.2799999999997
and I've grown 20 subscribers hmm

2195.52 --> 2202.619
seems very logical doesn't it

2198.28 --> 2202.619
that's totally natural right

2209.8 --> 2216.1800000000003
whoa yeah Martin Luther has 37

2213.339 --> 2216.18
000 subscribers

2220.72 --> 2224.64
what do you expect on YouTube

2226.839 --> 2230.98
I expect that more people will find my

2230.02 --> 2235.5
channel

2230.98 --> 2235.5
and actually subscribe to me

2238.839 --> 2244.2999999999997
not 20 in a year

2242.079 --> 2249.119
50 what is it

2244.3 --> 2249.119
think about it guys this is not normal

2255.46 --> 2259.359
presenting diff visuals makes a

2257.859 --> 2261.22
difference oh yeah does it Michael Khan

2259.359 --> 2263.68
well guess what I got title cards now

2261.22 --> 2267.22
for two weeks you know man how many

2263.68 --> 2269.5
subscribers I gained since then

2267.22 --> 2274.24
zero

2269.5 --> 2278.68
zero My Views doubled yeah they doubled

2274.24 --> 2280.18
I got zero subscribers since I added

2278.68 --> 2284.9199999999996
that

2280.18 --> 2287.2
oh hey how about the visuals yeah how

2284.92 --> 2288.88
how about my freaking background isn't

2287.2 --> 2291.3999999999996
that awesome thanks to

2288.88 --> 2294.52
Adam making

2291.4 --> 2296.619
for finding and fixing that for me isn't

2294.52 --> 2299.92
that awesome that you can look at that

2296.619 --> 2303.3
and and check out the stream the chat of

2299.92 --> 2303.3
the stream on on video

2303.7 --> 2307.7999999999997
doesn't really seem to matter that much

2308.5 --> 2313.18
I mean you guys in chat will be like oh

2310.96 --> 2315.64
yeah that is nice that is cool that's

2313.18 --> 2317.5789999999997
nice well hasn't really gained me any

2315.64 --> 2321.2799999999997
subscribers how to say

2317.579 --> 2322.3
more visuals no it doesn't make a

2321.28 --> 2325.0600000000004
difference

2322.3 --> 2328.9
it hasn't made a difference

2325.06 --> 2330.4
you gotta see that now I haven't gained

2328.9 --> 2333.579
subscribers

2330.4 --> 2337.06
I had a whole visual overhaul of my show

2333.579 --> 2341.6400000000003
I got title cards in that whole period I

2337.06 --> 2341.64
got maybe 50 subscribers

2342.94 --> 2347.859
explain that to me how that works

2345.099 --> 2351.119
logistically on YouTube the probably the

2347.859 --> 2351.119
biggest platform on Earth

2354.72 --> 2357.839
thank you

2365.5 --> 2368.339
ah

2371.26 --> 2376.0600000000004
you're stuck at 1200. yeah okay good

2374.32 --> 2380.2200000000003
servant well

2376.06 --> 2380.22
how long did it take you to get that

2381.22 --> 2387.2999999999997
did it take you two years

2383.68 --> 2387.2999999999997
like I like me

2387.76 --> 2392.82
or did it take you a couple of months

2405.64 --> 2410.0989999999997
right a year oh that's good man

2410.2 --> 2414.5789999999997
now of course you had already a lot of

2412.3 --> 2417.4
connections you have connections through

2414.579 --> 2419.44
my channel through Nathan Oakley in a

2417.4 --> 2421.599
way I had connections through Nathan

2419.44 --> 2424.66
Oakley as well

2421.599 --> 2428.02
he really did help me

2424.66 --> 2430.68
grow and motivate me to do the early

2428.02 --> 2430.68
bird show

2434.2 --> 2440.5
but yeah for all that effort

2438.16 --> 2442.8999999999996
and almost three years live streaming

2440.5 --> 2445.96
every single day

2442.9 --> 2448.54
yeah this you can't really say that this

2445.96 --> 2450.339
is a normal growth rate

2448.54 --> 2452.7599999999998
for a Channel with that level of

2450.339 --> 2452.7599999999998
activity

2459.339 --> 2463.599
you are important part of fvd thank you

2461.44 --> 2464.8
I appreciate that I'd like to think so

2463.599 --> 2466.1800000000003
myself

2464.8 --> 2470.02
yeah

2466.18 --> 2471.7
but yeah my amount of subscribers My

2470.02 --> 2475.599
overall reach

2471.7 --> 2476.7999999999997
people not reaching out to me it doesn't

2475.599 --> 2479.2000000000003
really

2476.8 --> 2481.8590000000004
prove that though

2479.2 --> 2481.859
does it

2490.859 --> 2494.7
subscript wins

2495.76 --> 2498.48
okay

2498.81 --> 2501.949
[Music]

2502.54 --> 2507.339
okay I really appreciate that return to

2505.18 --> 2509.319
normal but

2507.339 --> 2513.64
I wish

2509.319 --> 2516.46
the results would reflect that a little

2513.64 --> 2519.4
instead of having to hear that come from

2516.46 --> 2521.56
somebody in chat as a genuine statement

2519.4 --> 2525.06
and I really appreciate that on the

2521.56 --> 2527.74
personal note it's just that yeah the

2525.06 --> 2531.54
statistics the growth rate of my channel

2527.74 --> 2531.54
doesn't seem to reflect that

2536.319 --> 2541.0
I have put myself out there I probably

2538.78 --> 2544.48
put myself out there than any other

2541.0 --> 2548.44
person you've ever come across

2544.48 --> 2552.72
yeah I've literally laid down my entire

2548.44 --> 2556.78
life with shames pitfalls Dark Times

2552.72 --> 2560.6189999999997
hallucinations and dreams everything I

2556.78 --> 2562.3590000000004
put it all out there all of it

2560.619 --> 2565.2000000000003
truthfully

2562.359 --> 2565.2
carefully

2566.859 --> 2573.339
doesn't really seem to matter because

2570.52 --> 2575.2
yeah I don't even have 2 000 subscribers

2573.339 --> 2577.119
now I don't want to be complaining about

2575.2 --> 2579.46
that all the time like for the technical

2577.119 --> 2583.7400000000002
running of my show it doesn't matter I

2579.46 --> 2583.7400000000002
just I feel a little insulted

2588.94 --> 2595.06
like I feel a little in an indirect way

2592.619 --> 2597.1600000000003
tied back into a subject I feel a little

2595.06 --> 2598.54
like Britney Spears right now

2597.16 --> 2600.46
is

2598.54 --> 2603.4
okay that's a really silly thing to say

2600.46 --> 2605.56
but I think most of you know what I mean

2603.4 --> 2609.4
I'm being kept

2605.56 --> 2611.5
in this tiny circle thing with not a lot

2609.4 --> 2614.5
of reach and there's somebody just

2611.5 --> 2617.5
conservator shipping over me like I'm a

2614.5 --> 2620.02
crazy person and like oh no no we we

2617.5 --> 2622.72
can't open those doors

2620.02 --> 2625.0
we can't have let him have the actual

2622.72 --> 2627.7
amount of subscribers that somebody of

2625.0 --> 2630.22
what his activity is supposed to have we

2627.7 --> 2633.7799999999997
can't allow that so yeah I feel a little

2630.22 --> 2633.7799999999997
like Britney Spears right now

2633.94 --> 2637.38
I feel penned in

2639.88 --> 2643.5
and I I want yeah

2644.44 --> 2649.8
I'm I'm getting

2646.3 --> 2649.8
annoyed by it

2649.96 --> 2655.0
depending on

2652.74 --> 2657.7
on my mood

2655.0 --> 2660.46
I get very annoyed

2657.7 --> 2662.3999999999996
to just like

2660.46 --> 2665.56
a little disappointed in the background

2662.4 --> 2669.0
yeah and currently I am really annoyed

2665.56 --> 2669.0
by it just like I was yesterday

2671.92 --> 2674.099
foreign

2689.02 --> 2695.88
yes I agree I should be

2693.099 --> 2695.88
at least

2699.7 --> 2704.7999999999997
I mean it would be kind of difficult to

2702.4 --> 2707.079
deal with chat like that though because

2704.8 --> 2709.1800000000003
yeah when you got like 12K subscribers

2707.079 --> 2711.599
just look at Martin Luther's jet like

2709.18 --> 2715.8999999999996
it's constantly just

2711.599 --> 2719.52
like it's very hard to keep track of it

2715.9 --> 2719.52
at a live pace

2721.54 --> 2724.8
but I can do it

2740.14 --> 2745.42
how many people get banned before they

2742.66 --> 2748.1189999999997
have a chance to subscribe uh nobody

2745.42 --> 2750.96
because you can always subscribe even if

2748.119 --> 2750.96
you get banned

2752.44 --> 2756.579
if I ban somebody that doesn't

2754.3 --> 2760.48
automatically unsubscribe them

2756.579 --> 2763.54
and hey if they get banned then

2760.48 --> 2766.119
maybe I don't need an individual like

2763.54 --> 2769.18
that right I don't need Tagalongs

2766.119 --> 2771.4
that are just gonna try to suck

2769.18 --> 2774.04
of whatever energy and not actually

2771.4 --> 2775.54
contribute anything not provably learn

2774.04 --> 2778.02
something

2775.54 --> 2778.02
right

2779.8 --> 2785.92
I would prefer

2782.14 --> 2790.44
people in my chat that actually want to

2785.92 --> 2790.44
help me run the show as I do

2790.839 --> 2794.38
and not just get in the way right I

2793.24 --> 2799.8999999999996
don't need

2794.38 --> 2802.359
a million useless feeder idiots to

2799.9 --> 2804.819
subscribe they're not gonna get anything

2802.359 --> 2807.16
out of what I do anyway because they

2804.819 --> 2810.52
they can't Attain

2807.16 --> 2813.94
that Clarity in order to even freaking

2810.52 --> 2816.54
understand what I'm talking about

2813.94 --> 2816.54
right

2825.28 --> 2828.3590000000004
right have you been on

2828.64 --> 2834.359
i o toddactic site what

2836.859 --> 2840.24
hey Donato br

2843.099 --> 2847.839
yeah I forgot to say hello to you

2844.72 --> 2851.16
yesterday this has been chat I saw you

2847.839 --> 2851.16
watching back to show

2870.88 --> 2873.42
right

2875.559 --> 2880.8390000000004
right but yeah look there's plenty of

2878.859 --> 2884.5
not a problem how are you I'm doing

2880.839 --> 2887.02
great I'm a little fired up though

2884.5 --> 2888.64
and disappointing Nathan is not having a

2887.02 --> 2892.14
live show

2888.64 --> 2892.14
today apparently

2893.2 --> 2897.819
right but there's plenty of people here

2895.66 --> 2901.839
that have been following me that are

2897.819 --> 2904.9
really amused by how I Smash down the

2901.839 --> 2908.319
Gammas how I do get rid of the trolls

2904.9 --> 2911.859
so to say okay I'm not just I'm just not

2908.319 --> 2914.44
gonna ban anyone anymore because they

2911.859 --> 2916.48
might subscribe to me if I don't right

2914.44 --> 2920.319
well that's gonna put off a whole bunch

2916.48 --> 2922.78
of people that kind of like me to do

2920.319 --> 2924.2799999999997
Smash It and clear the room so there can

2922.78 --> 2926.76
be an actual conversation that's

2924.28 --> 2926.76
productive

2938.38 --> 2943.559
King Dave what

2940.72 --> 2943.5589999999997
who is that

2943.72 --> 2949.0589999999997
King Dave what

2946.78 --> 2952.8590000000004
I I don't know we were talking about

2949.059 --> 2952.8590000000004
Susan Pryor who's this

2953.44 --> 2956.4
King Dave

2970.66 --> 2974.44
gentle influence and knowledge isn't for

2973.0 --> 2977.04
everybody

2974.44 --> 2977.04
well

2977.38 --> 2983.079
maybe not all the time but is that like

2980.14 --> 2985.42
the only thing I have to offer am I this

2983.079 --> 2988.599
guy that's always just like

2985.42 --> 2991.48
yeah I'm always calm and I'll talk about

2988.599 --> 2994.9
psychology and things happening but I'll

2991.48 --> 2997.9
never raise my voice and um

2994.9 --> 3000.96
no I'm passionate all the time

2997.9 --> 3003.2400000000002
so to say that gentle influence and

3000.96 --> 3006.98
knowledge is like the only thing I offer

3003.24 --> 3006.9799999999996
that's not true though

3010.079 --> 3015.9
I have plenty of sides to my character

3013.26 --> 3018.119
that I show

3015.9 --> 3022.52
right I go through all kinds of Cycles

3018.119 --> 3022.52
including emotions and all that so

3026.46 --> 3032.52
but thank you for your input though

3029.16 --> 3034.94
right it is genuine input it is a

3032.52 --> 3037.859
response to my original request

3034.94 --> 3039.48
yesterday where I asked so if there's

3037.859 --> 3040.88
something wrong is there something about

3039.48 --> 3044.16
me

3040.88 --> 3046.079
besides being a gamma anti-flat Earth or

3044.16 --> 3047.7599999999998
idiot right because I don't care what

3046.079 --> 3050.28
you have to say

3047.76 --> 3052.559
if anybody else out there

3050.28 --> 3056.28
is this thing about Arwin that just

3052.559 --> 3058.3190000000004
makes you think like no no I don't want

3056.28 --> 3060.78
to subscribe to this guy I don't want to

3058.319 --> 3062.599
watch his show

3060.78 --> 3066.3
if there is something

3062.599 --> 3069.059
tell me what it is

3066.3 --> 3070.7400000000002
I'm not getting the message from anybody

3069.059 --> 3073.26
about it

3070.74 --> 3074.7599999999998
nobody's telling me like oh there's this

3073.26 --> 3077.94
thing

3074.76 --> 3080.2200000000003
I only advice I really get is like oh

3077.94 --> 3083.099
expand expand expand just you need to

3080.22 --> 3085.2799999999997
explode more you need more things you

3083.099 --> 3087.96
need more prepared

3085.28 --> 3089.46
presentations you need more visuals you

3087.96 --> 3092.16
need guests on the show like anything

3089.46 --> 3094.68
anything but just me having my Daily

3092.16 --> 3096.7799999999997
Show what I do it that is what this

3094.68 --> 3099.4199999999996
channel is like anything but that so is

3096.78 --> 3101.28
that it is me coming on the show every

3099.42 --> 3104.94
day talking about

3101.28 --> 3109.8190000000004
all everything for an hour two hours

3104.94 --> 3109.819
is that simply not good enough

3113.22 --> 3119.339
because if you're just trying to find

3116.22 --> 3122.0989999999997
some kind of logically seemingly logical

3119.339 --> 3123.599
reason why my subscriber amount isn't

3122.099 --> 3125.04
growing and you're just giving me a

3123.599 --> 3126.96
suggestion like maybe if you do this

3125.04 --> 3128.94
maybe if you're there yeah I've been

3126.96 --> 3131.7
gone going through that for like two

3128.94 --> 3134.579
years straight

3131.7 --> 3138.5
doesn't matter I already said like I

3134.579 --> 3138.5
just started doing title cards

3140.76 --> 3144.9
doesn't matter

3142.559 --> 3147.5400000000004
it just doesn't seem to matter

3144.9 --> 3151.079
I'm still doing it though because I like

3147.54 --> 3153.7799999999997
doing it now I kind of want to do it now

3151.079 --> 3157.8590000000004
but it doesn't really seem to matter

3153.78 --> 3160.3190000000004
much for my subscriber amount

3157.859 --> 3162.7799999999997
so it's not about oh if you do that if

3160.319 --> 3166.5
you just expand if you just do more more

3162.78 --> 3168.8390000000004
more more presentation like prove us you

3166.5 --> 3172.559
have absolutely no life are we and prove

3168.839 --> 3176.04
to us that you spend 16 hours a day on

3172.559 --> 3179.0400000000004
nothing else but doing work

3176.04 --> 3181.319
that'll show for the early bird show is

3179.04 --> 3184.8
that like the only thing you can think

3181.319 --> 3187.2599999999998
of I have to literally spend every

3184.8 --> 3189.78
conceivable thing I can

3187.26 --> 3193.44
on doing this show and then I'd be

3189.78 --> 3196.3390000000004
getting more subscribe so how is that

3193.44 --> 3196.339
makes sense

3196.38 --> 3199.4
that is good enough

3201.42 --> 3207.42
well what I do should be good enough

3204.0 --> 3210.839
and when I do more I'll do more

3207.42 --> 3213.78
it shouldn't in the face of just the the

3210.839 --> 3216.7799999999997
growing curve of my subscribers it

3213.78 --> 3219.8390000000004
shouldn't matter I have a daily show

3216.78 --> 3222.6600000000003
every day it has pretty decent graphics

3219.839 --> 3226.02
as good subjects is a direct live

3222.66 --> 3229.0789999999997
Dynamic with my chat

3226.02 --> 3231.559
it should be good enough

3229.079 --> 3231.559
right

3237.48 --> 3243.68
thank you I appreciate the encouraging

3240.54 --> 3243.68
words they're not the BR

3252.96 --> 3258.68
Flat Earth from New Zealand okay

3255.599 --> 3258.6800000000003
never heard of him

3262.02 --> 3266.579
it's gonna be extremely difficult to

3264.54 --> 3269.54
actually find his YouTube channel just

3266.579 --> 3269.54
on that name though

3274.14 --> 3279.1189999999997
it's like calling your YouTube channel

3276.54 --> 3281.7
my YouTube oh you're gonna call your

3279.119 --> 3284.579
channel my YouTube oh well

3281.7 --> 3287.9399999999996
I'm sure that's not gonna yield like at

3284.579 --> 3291.54
least 10 000 accounts call that

3287.94 --> 3293.96
most of which aren't even active

3291.54 --> 3293.96
right

3298.92 --> 3302.7200000000003
check it out if I can see your Channel

3306.839 --> 3309.5
nope

3310.14 --> 3313.0789999999997
yes

3311.579 --> 3316.26
yes it do

3313.079 --> 3319.28
search results are literally completely

3316.26 --> 3319.28
over the place

3321.26 --> 3328.26
completely over the place

3324.54 --> 3328.2599999999998
what the hell okay

3334.559 --> 3340.52
my opinion on e-board I don't know what

3336.9 --> 3340.52
that is what is that

3359.4 --> 3364.7400000000002
I remember you doing an impression of

3361.859 --> 3368.94
Don you mean done threader wow that's a

3364.74 --> 3370.74
long time ago that's like four years ago

3368.94 --> 3372.92
I haven't seen Down threader in a long

3370.74 --> 3372.9199999999996
time

YouTube ER okay

3383.94 --> 3389.52

3392.28 --> 3395.299
I War

3395.46 --> 3400.4

3434.819 --> 3437.819
lhfe

3438.98 --> 3444.26
this video seemed to be called that for

3441.839 --> 3444.2599999999998
some reason

3451.559 --> 3455.9
I guess I'll take a look

3466.2 --> 3470.48
the Lost history of Flat Earth okay

3470.64 --> 3474.14
that's what it stands for

3475.26 --> 3479.94

3486.359 --> 3493.52
all right okay well an hour video looks

3490.319 --> 3493.52

it gets a lot of viewers

3499.44 --> 3505.64

3517.76 --> 3522.26
the Felon show what is that

3533.819 --> 3537.92
like again this is just

3538.68 --> 3540.859
foreign

3568.38 --> 3573.059
Don is a flatter now I I absolutely

3571.44 --> 3576.02
don't believe it

3573.059 --> 3576.02
no way

3592.26 --> 3597.3590000000004
okay the Felon show with King Dave is

3595.02 --> 3598.7599999999998
that the YouTube channel you're talking

3597.359 --> 3601.799
about

3598.76 --> 3604.099
specifically I see Martin litke there on

3601.799 --> 3604.099
a video

3614.22 --> 3619.04
the Felon show with King Dave is that

3616.619 --> 3619.04
the channel

3624.059 --> 3629.48
fine I'll just go look at another

3626.52 --> 3629.48
person's Channel

3634.26 --> 3641.3390000000004
I mean apparently I I just need to get

3637.799 --> 3644.16
into people's freaking faces to tell

3641.339 --> 3646.619
them hey hello did you know I have a

3644.16 --> 3648.5989999999997
freaking Daily Show every freaking day

3646.619 --> 3651.54
and I've talked about this for five

3648.599 --> 3654.02
years can you please take a freaking

3651.54 --> 3654.02
look

3654.299 --> 3658.44
because everybody's just doing their own

3656.52 --> 3661.859
shows and they're going around and

3658.44 --> 3663.66
they're talking to everybody except me

3661.859 --> 3665.88
maybe they come here and then they see

3663.66 --> 3667.74
like me Banning a bunch of Gammas and

3665.88 --> 3668.579
then they say oh maybe I'm not gonna try

3667.74 --> 3671.5989999999997
that

3668.579 --> 3671.599
I don't know man

3672.54 --> 3678.48
I guess I'll have to start my own

3674.7 --> 3681.0
Armenian public relations Diplomat

3678.48 --> 3685.7400000000002
function because otherwise nobody's

3681.0 --> 3688.14
gonna pay [ __ ] attention to me I guess

3685.74 --> 3689.9399999999996
just have to go out and they're out

3688.14 --> 3692.64
there like oh you have a nice channel

3689.94 --> 3693.96
did you know about me advertisement for

3692.64 --> 3696.48
me now

3693.96 --> 3698.819
this is

3696.48 --> 3702.079
not literally like that of course

3698.819 --> 3702.079
that would be silly

3706.319 --> 3711.299
yeah Dutch sailor I know you do I really

3708.599 --> 3714.6800000000003
appreciate that

3711.299 --> 3714.68
I appreciate you do that

3724.44 --> 3729.839
he is not a global so are we talking

3726.9 --> 3733.92
about Don threader or are you talking

3729.839 --> 3736.02
about a guy that calls himself Don and

3733.92 --> 3737.579
that's it because then it's not dawn

3736.02 --> 3739.559
threader and then I doubt that I

3737.579 --> 3742.7400000000002
actually

3739.559 --> 3745.3190000000004
enacted his voice it is dumb threader

3742.74 --> 3748.8799999999997
with an H

3745.319 --> 3748.88
not Don Teeter

3750.66 --> 3755.8999999999996
okay so he's not a Glover anymore I

3753.72 --> 3755.8999999999996
guess

3758.579 --> 3762.96
fine

3760.26 --> 3766.579
don't don't know if I'm gonna care about

3762.96 --> 3766.579
him but whatever

3768.359 --> 3772.859
I thought he was actually kind of

3770.339 --> 3774.42
annoying back in the day but I don't

3772.859 --> 3776.7599999999998
know I haven't heard from him

3774.42 --> 3778.559
so he's going around I take it he's not

3776.76 --> 3780.92
coming back to the Flat Earth debates

3778.559 --> 3780.92
then

3782.099 --> 3791.599
the one who has a drone okay oh that one

3786.78 --> 3791.599
the one who has a drone okay yeah

3793.68 --> 3797.7599999999998
look if it's done threader

3795.96 --> 3799.559
then I know who you're talking to I

3797.76 --> 3802.2000000000003
remember the name

3799.559 --> 3804.799
that's like early debates letter debates

3802.2 --> 3807.359
when we're still talking about

3804.799 --> 3810.2
calculating how much curvature there

3807.359 --> 3810.2
should be and all that

3811.74 --> 3816.4799999999996
if he's now become a flat earther well

3813.96 --> 3819.059
good on him

3816.48 --> 3822.559
and we haven't heard anything about him

3819.059 --> 3822.559
except through you now

3835.14 --> 3839.839
he is a nice guy okay fine he's a nice

3837.539 --> 3839.8390000000004
guy

3842.119 --> 3847.2000000000003
I'll size it up when I bump into him

3845.94 --> 3850.31
you know

3847.2 --> 3850.31
[Music]

3863.16 --> 3867.359
that's why I don't even know what Dawn

3865.619 --> 3871.26
threader remembers like I only really

3867.359 --> 3874.44
remember remember Mark Tyler

3871.26 --> 3876.96
early fluffers

3874.44 --> 3878.819
I don't remember what Don threader

3876.96 --> 3880.98
sounded like I literally don't it's been

3878.819 --> 3883.02
too long ago I do remember the name I

3880.98 --> 3885.14
don't remember what it sounded like at

3883.02 --> 3885.14
all

3889.74 --> 3896.52
right Don Hub wants to show up in my

3893.099 --> 3898.1400000000003
chat and say hello that's great show up

3896.52 --> 3901.02
in my chat and say hello that's fine

3898.14 --> 3905.96
dude I'll even call you in on Skype and

3901.02 --> 3905.96
we can talk about what made you change

3906.059 --> 3911.88
from defending the globe towards

3909.0 --> 3915.119
becoming a flat earther as you get guys

3911.88 --> 3917.539
in chat now say right um sure I'll have

3915.119 --> 3917.539
you on

3919.2 --> 3922.339
very monotonous

3927.539 --> 3932.3390000000004
another one to check out I guess well

3929.579 --> 3934.6800000000003
Rob H look he's from like the early Flat

3932.339 --> 3936.24
Earth debate days like he was around the

3934.68 --> 3940.9199999999996
first two years

3936.24 --> 3943.14
and then as soon as the Black Swan

3940.92 --> 3946.079
or even before that as soon as that

3943.14 --> 3948.48
really broke and the flatters debate set

3946.079 --> 3950.28
up for the show changed from being

3948.48 --> 3954.7400000000002
completely filled with globers to

3950.28 --> 3954.7400000000002
actually having a panel of flat earthers

3955.2 --> 3963.66
then he kind of dropped away just like

3959.339 --> 3966.98
flat or uh what is it curved water was

3963.66 --> 3966.98
also from that Old group

3968.839 --> 3972.5389999999998
euclidean three space con what does that

3971.7 --> 3975.0589999999997
mean

3972.539 --> 3976.44
the idea are you talking about a person

3975.059 --> 3978.42
now I don't know what you're talking

3976.44 --> 3980.96
about

3978.42 --> 3980.96
Cleary

3982.799 --> 3987.799
you used to get tea bag for a lot before

3984.66 --> 3987.799
tea bagging was a thing

3989.52 --> 3992.78
I think I remember that

4004.79 --> 4007.889
[Music]

4011.04 --> 4014.21
[Music]

4017.18 --> 4023.48
trying to help me expand well sure Susan

4020.059 --> 4026.3590000000004
Pryor well if that just if that means if

4023.48 --> 4028.4
that implies hey Arwin

4026.359 --> 4031.0989999999997
you're a hermit

4028.4 --> 4034.88
we don't give a [ __ ] about Hermits

4031.099 --> 4038.1800000000003
people only care about you if you social

4034.88 --> 4041.6600000000003
network like if like you were Trump or

4038.18 --> 4044.96
some freaking social genius Diplomat

4041.66 --> 4047.18
that can literally remember like a

4044.96 --> 4049.64
thousand people's names and like what

4047.18 --> 4052.0989999999997
they've done right

4049.64 --> 4053.839
I'm not one of those people I don't

4052.099 --> 4054.98
remember that

4053.839 --> 4057.799
this is

4054.98 --> 4059.599
like I've known that like people

4057.799 --> 4062.24
especially some women

4059.599 --> 4064.579
that would just like bump into anybody

4062.24 --> 4066.9799999999996
and then immediately ask them a question

4064.579 --> 4070.039
about what is going on in their life is

4066.98 --> 4072.98
like how the hell do you remember

4070.039 --> 4075.559
something about every single person you

4072.98 --> 4077.539
bump into I don't understand that I

4075.559 --> 4081.28
don't understand how you do that

4077.539 --> 4081.28
I don't remember that much

4083.78 --> 4089.9
do you Dutch do that often what what are

4088.22 --> 4092.0
you talking about

4089.9 --> 4097.299
kiwi Yama

4092.0 --> 4097.299
I'm not you Dutch I'm Arwin

4099.259 --> 4106.58
I wouldn't call myself typically Dutch

4103.819 --> 4109.52
but I don't know maybe compared to the

4106.58 --> 4110.16
rest of the world I am

4109.52 --> 4113.330000000001
whatever

4110.16 --> 4113.33
[Music]

4114.62 --> 4119.259

4119.259 --> 4124.279
euclidean threes basically are you

4122.06 --> 4126.7390000000005
talking about a person or are you

4124.279 --> 4130.540000000001
talking about an argument

4126.739 --> 4132.919999999999
can you please be a little bit more

4130.54 --> 4135.259
forthcoming with the data instead of

4132.92 --> 4136.759
just a couple of words and then oh

4135.259 --> 4140.259
you'll just have to guess everything

4136.759 --> 4140.259
about what I'm saying right now

4141.259 --> 4146.839
how about that how about you actually

4143.799 --> 4149.42
with a remark

4146.839 --> 4152.299
give some enlightening details about

4149.42 --> 4154.64
what you're actually talking about that

4152.299 --> 4156.08
will be great so I don't have to spend a

4154.64 --> 4158.38
minute guessing what you're talking

4156.08 --> 4158.38
about

4165.199 --> 4173.0599999999995
so are you talking about euclidean three

4168.199 --> 4176.0599999999995
space as an argument the argument

4173.06 --> 4180.02
converted on or are you talking about an

4176.06 --> 4183.319
individual that calls himself euclidean

4180.02 --> 4185.96
three space can you please inform me

4183.319 --> 4189.64
Clary

4185.96 --> 4189.64
three minutes later now

4200.54 --> 4207.4
right so the argument

4204.5 --> 4207.4
the argument

4211.94 --> 4214.9
fine good

4231.739 --> 4236.08
[ __ ] are you talking about kiwi gammer

4240.62 --> 4243.92
foreign

4241.64 --> 4246.08
what does that have to do with you Dutch

4243.92 --> 4248.6
are you trying to be

4246.08 --> 4252.04
freaking racist to me

4248.6 --> 4252.04
about my nationality

4284.9 --> 4291.0199999999995
right so anybody in chat especially new

4288.02 --> 4295.400000000001
people if you are gonna engage in a

4291.02 --> 4299.06
conversation with other people in chat

4295.4 --> 4303.32
it would be great if you actually put

4299.06 --> 4306.1990000000005
their names into what you say otherwise

4303.32 --> 4308.179
it's going to be very very confusing for

4306.199 --> 4309.62
me and I'm gonna think that you're

4308.179 --> 4311.0
actually trying to have a conversation

4309.62 --> 4313.58
with me

4311.0 --> 4316.159
and that's gonna completely grind the

4313.58 --> 4318.199
entire show to a halt because we're

4316.159 --> 4319.699
miscommunicating because I think that

4318.199 --> 4322.159
you're addressing me when you're talking

4319.699 --> 4323.9
to somebody else

4322.159 --> 4326.679
so please if you're going to have a

4323.9 --> 4330.98
conversation with someone else in chat

4326.679 --> 4333.64
please make that clear by adding their

4330.98 --> 4333.639999999999
name to it

4339.56 --> 4344.780000000001
this was today okay well okay me gamer I

4343.28 --> 4346.759999999999

4346.76 --> 4349.3
right

4350.239 --> 4355.0

I mean are you like really enthusiastic

4379.64 --> 4385.9400000000005
because you remember a Dutch thing and

4383.3 --> 4388.34

4385.94 --> 4390.44
is somehow important now

4388.34 --> 4393.76
like what

what are you talking about

4394.46 --> 4399.86

4397.159 --> 4402.739
cycling Sports especially watching it on

4399.86 --> 4405.739
television okay I find it one of the

4402.739 --> 4409.4
most boring Sports there exists

4405.739 --> 4411.759999999999
I not interested I mean I like riding on

4409.4 --> 4411.759999999999
my bike

4413.179 --> 4417.32

4417.32 --> 4420.739
of other people

4419.12 --> 4422.719
cycle

4420.739 --> 4425.199

[Music]

4492.26 --> 4497.02
no I'm not watching the Olympics

4503.06 --> 4508.280000000001
I mean currently the Olympics must be

4505.64 --> 4511.64
like one of the gayest sport events that

4508.28 --> 4516.32
ever existed here on Earth right now

4511.64 --> 4518.179
it's so globalist messed up [ __ ]

4516.32 --> 4521.0599999999995
everything about it's become total

4518.179 --> 4522.4400000000005
horseshit like why would you want to

4521.06 --> 4527.120000000001
watch any of that

4522.44 --> 4530.36
right the original idea of the Olympics

4527.12 --> 4534.28
is halfway decent interesting right now

4530.36 --> 4537.259999999999
it's all turned to totally gay [ __ ]

4534.28 --> 4540.04
woke [ __ ] right exactly what you're

4537.26 --> 4540.04
talking about hey

4541.52 --> 4546.280000000001
what the hell oh page

4547.4 --> 4551.139999999999
why did you time him out

4562.82 --> 4570.4
hello Robert why did you time him out

4568.219 --> 4570.4
foreign

4573.92 --> 4576.92
ER

4580.28 --> 4587.36
God answered all our prayers yesterday

4582.44 --> 4589.879999999999
wow oh really AGM really he did

4587.36 --> 4592.28
explain that one to me

4589.88 --> 4594.58
how did God answer all our prayers

4592.28 --> 4594.58
yesterday

4596.54 --> 4601.82
just delete the message I don't know I

4599.659 --> 4605.739
don't know what message there was that

4601.82 --> 4605.739
needed deleting at all

4611.3 --> 4614.3
foreign

4628.219 --> 4637.1
Rob H I really want you to please

4631.76 --> 4639.26
respond in chat because yeah you just at

4637.1 --> 4642.56
a minor in friction

4639.26 --> 4644.900000000001
on your wrench responsibility and I

4642.56 --> 4646.88
don't like that so I want you to please

4644.9 --> 4650.679
explain why you did that otherwise I'm

4646.88 --> 4650.679
gonna take your wrench away

4657.26 --> 4663.5
a pocket ban

4659.84 --> 4665.78
okay well look if that happens

4663.5 --> 4668.78
oh it was by accident okay well that

4665.78 --> 4670.82
means that apparently you don't have

4668.78 --> 4672.86
control

4670.82 --> 4675.739
so then I'm gonna take away the wrench

4672.86 --> 4678.98
because you cannot be trusted with it to

4675.739 --> 4681.919999999999
secure your system enough to not by

4678.98 --> 4683.299999999999
accident time people out

4681.92 --> 4686.92
you see

4683.3 --> 4686.92
you need to have that under control

4692.6 --> 4699.14
people mistake Rob not a a

4696.739 --> 4701.36
he's not in chat

4699.14 --> 4705.4400000000005
I don't know who you're talking about

4701.36 --> 4708.739
but he hasn't actually spoken up in chat

4705.44 --> 4712.299999999999
so don't make excuses up for him when he

4708.739 --> 4712.299999999999
hasn't even spoken up in chat

4715.34 --> 4719.719
and I'm I mean I like robbage he's

4718.04 --> 4721.64
pretty awesome

4719.719 --> 4724.88
he sent me

4721.64 --> 4726.320000000001
a pretty pretty cool

4724.88 --> 4729.64
oh God

4726.32 --> 4729.639999999999
emails over time

4730.04 --> 4736.4
oh God freaking Aaron Armstrong piece of

4733.88 --> 4739.219
[ __ ] is emailing me again

4736.4 --> 4741.5599999999995
of dude literally

4739.219 --> 4744.32
there's one of those [ __ ] that

4741.56 --> 4745.9400000000005
really needs to get the [ __ ] out of this

4744.32 --> 4746.5199999999995
world

4745.94 --> 4748.099999999999
God

4746.52 --> 4750.38
[Music]

4748.1 --> 4754.04
talk about an individual that will never

4750.38 --> 4758.62
ever be unbanned ever no matter the cost

4754.04 --> 4758.62
never unban that piece of [ __ ] ever

4767.239 --> 4772.04
right so I'm gonna take away Rob H's

4769.58 --> 4774.46
wrench because apparently he's not good

4772.04 --> 4774.46
for it

4797.12 --> 4803.86
maybe one time I'll give it back to him

4799.58 --> 4803.86
but first he has to actually deserve it

4817.639 --> 4821.179
right okay

4822.5 --> 4825.76
I'll be back in two minutes

4893.84 --> 4896.08
foreign

4904.88 --> 4908.02
and I'm back

4919.44 --> 4923.0599999999995
[Music]

4921.26 --> 4926.56
that's a good point they're gaining

4923.06 --> 4926.56
wisdom yes I agree

4933.32 --> 4939.62
I try to be just very careful with

4936.679 --> 4941.96
branching people and make it blatantly

4939.62 --> 4945.82
obvious that it comes with a very

4941.96 --> 4945.82
specific set of responsibilities

4946.34 --> 4952.46
and it's been working out great I think

4949.28 --> 4955.36
I am very happy with the way that I'm

4952.46 --> 4955.36
managing my chat

4955.4 --> 4961.36
but I guess that's sometimes weird

4957.5 --> 4961.36
incidences like this do happen

4968.48 --> 4972.82
uh AGM it wasn't AGM

4973.04 --> 4977.3
don't

4974.9 --> 4979.9
don't get all triggered now return to

4977.3 --> 4983.08
normal I think that somebody

4979.9 --> 4985.339999999999
he AGM didn't time you out Rob H

4983.08 --> 4987.5599999999995
apparently timed you out he's not even

4985.34 --> 4992.4400000000005
in chat it was probably an accident I

4987.56 --> 4995.84
revoked his wrench so please refer yeah

4992.44 --> 4998.12
refrain yourself from

4995.84 --> 4999.7390000000005
getting out against other people in chat

4998.12 --> 5000.699
that has not have nothing to do with

4999.739 --> 5003.36
this

5000.699 --> 5003.36
thank you

5020.02 --> 5022.9800000000005
welcome back

5037.0 --> 5042.639
but like Clary said originally it was

5039.46 --> 5044.7390000000005
probably a pocket ban because I directly

5042.639 --> 5047.38
addressed Rob H for his action and he

5044.739 --> 5051.178999999999
hasn't spoken up

5047.38 --> 5051.179
which is very weird by the way

5052.96 --> 5056.679
I mean if he was actually listening to

5055.6 --> 5058.96
the show

5056.679 --> 5061.5
then he would have heard me address him

5058.96 --> 5061.5
it's weird

5065.679 --> 5071.92
unless he's got me on mute and is still

5068.92 --> 5073.96
following it and then pocketband it's a

5071.92 --> 5076.0
very weird scenario

5073.96 --> 5078.1
I don't understand exactly what happened

5076.0 --> 5082.5
here but

5078.1 --> 5082.5
hopefully we will find out later

5083.38 --> 5090.76
from Rob H himself

5086.159 --> 5092.98
Ron HS is it classic rubbish really is

5090.76 --> 5095.639
it happened before I don't remember him

5092.98 --> 5095.638999999999
doing that

5096.159 --> 5098.58
whatever

5101.02 --> 5103.4400000000005
talking about

5105.04 --> 5114.46
pocket super chats for 500. gosh

5111.159 --> 5118.12
now those are the best

5114.46 --> 5121.06
or even better pocket PayPal donations

5118.12 --> 5122.08
those are awesome I wish that would

5121.06 --> 5124.42
happen

5122.08 --> 5127.139
no I don't I don't that would be total

5124.42 --> 5127.139
chaos but

5130.3 --> 5133.1990000000005
you get my drift

5134.44 --> 5137.639999999999
[Music]

5140.61 --> 5143.969999999999
[Music]

5156.4 --> 5162.9
right so

5158.86 --> 5162.9
what were you talking about earlier

5167.739 --> 5171.36
I think we were talking about

5173.28 --> 5179.62
the Olympics the Gay Olympics

5177.76 --> 5181.6
probably call it

5179.62 --> 5185.44
oh trigger trigger trigger yeah yeah

5181.6 --> 5187.42
yeah the Gay Olympics

5185.44 --> 5190.86
right it's not Olympics anymore it's

5187.42 --> 5190.86
it's Gay Olympics now

5210.46 --> 5217.44
or I guess then a little bit more modest

5213.58 --> 5217.44
version would be the woke Olympics

5219.76 --> 5225.639
though that rhymes very much with woke

5222.82 --> 5230.88
limp dicks so

5225.639 --> 5230.88
yeah it's really now saving it is there

5236.139 --> 5241.2390000000005
rather watch paint dry

5238.84 --> 5243.719
then watch that work boost BS yeah yeah

5241.239 --> 5243.718999999999
totally

5252.94 --> 5258.099999999999
did anyone see the opening ceremony of

5255.82 --> 5262.0
the Olympics cringe ooh

5258.1 --> 5265.1990000000005
saying cringe is the cringiest thing you

5262.0 --> 5265.199
could think of though but

5265.6 --> 5270.34
like that word was banned by bear logic

5269.02 --> 5273.6990000000005
but that's fine

5270.34 --> 5278.28
yes it was it was but it wasn't just

5273.699 --> 5278.28
cringe it was just crazy it was

5279.4 --> 5285.46
like either childishly creative or just

5283.0 --> 5288.3
psychotic

5285.46 --> 5291.219
like who's going to represent a country

5288.3 --> 5297.360000000001
by a terrible accident

5291.219 --> 5297.36
like as as their icon that is insane

5299.38 --> 5305.38
so it wasn't just weird but woke it was

5302.38 --> 5307.179
crazy it was psychotic it was literally

5305.38 --> 5310.08
just

5307.179 --> 5310.08
not normal

5311.139 --> 5316.5
another alien invade well an alien

5313.3 --> 5316.5
invasion of the Mind

5317.08 --> 5321.85
like that

5318.72 --> 5321.85
[Music]

5323.56 --> 5330.900000000001
looked like a certain production what

5327.76 --> 5330.900000000001
what do you mean by that

5349.78 --> 5355.179
they ain't coming from space no

5352.12 --> 5356.5
nothing's coming from space

5355.179 --> 5358.659
that's right

5356.5 --> 5361.42
it's already been kind of halfway

5358.659 --> 5364.299999999999
established now also thanks to Alex

5361.42 --> 5365.52
Jones and the conspiracy talkers about

5364.3 --> 5369.88
it

5365.52 --> 5374.320000000001
aliens are actually interdimensionals

5369.88 --> 5376.659000000001
they come from within not outside right

5374.32 --> 5379.259999999999
that's

5376.659 --> 5379.259999999999
almost

5380.32 --> 5384.54
finding its way to mainstream almost

5391.12 --> 5397.239
right

5393.04 --> 5399.699
the alien Spirit the alien mindset comes

5397.239 --> 5402.879999999999
from within through the other dimensions

5399.699 --> 5406.299999999999
through our spirits

5402.88 --> 5410.9800000000005
it can be summoned and then if you allow

5406.3 --> 5413.139
yourself to accept it to defend it as

5410.98 --> 5418.138999999999
being normal

5413.139 --> 5418.139
then they take a foothold in your spirit

5421.679 --> 5425.08
extraterrestrial yeah but that's

5423.34 --> 5428.159000000001
technically incorrect because there is

5425.08 --> 5428.159
no extra Terra

5428.26 --> 5433.96
there's no Earth

5429.82 --> 5438.099999999999
realm outside of the earth Realm

5433.96 --> 5438.1
it's more like intra-terrestrial

5443.86 --> 5446.86
terrestrial

5471.84 --> 5475.5
hello sock account

5475.54 --> 5480.28
yeah I I hope you're not seriously

5478.06 --> 5482.860000000001

5480.28 --> 5487.199
when you call your account a person

5508.239 --> 5512.379999999999
relinquish your ident no relinquish your

5510.52 --> 5514.5
anonymity

5512.38 --> 5518.82

represent some of Who You Are

5519.28 --> 5523.48
to address me

5521.86 --> 5525.4

5525.4 --> 5531.699
conversation with Anonymous gammas

5529.54 --> 5534.5199999999995

5531.699 --> 5537.54
represent themselves yeah

5534.52 --> 5537.540000000001
I know I could

5789.699 --> 5794.82
dude walking barefoot on grass is

5792.28 --> 5794.82
amazing

5795.46 --> 5798.84
it's a real experience

5813.19 --> 5816.45
[Music]

5824.4 --> 5829.5

5867.699 --> 5874.239
oh

5869.38 --> 5877.08
okay a person I I appreciate that

5874.239 --> 5877.08
I really do

5878.08 --> 5884.199
especially in the face of

5880.56 --> 5886.6
my shows today and yesterday yeah thank

5884.199 --> 5889.379999999999
you very much I really appreciate that

5886.6 --> 5889.38
recognition

5892.54 --> 5898.92
yeah perseverance is definitely a word I

5895.48 --> 5898.919999999999
I'd like to associate with

5925.239 --> 5929.699
that's ridiculous dude get out of here

5931.36 --> 5935.86
some more of these stupid jokes it's

5933.88 --> 5940.36
like oh I heard

5935.86 --> 5941.92
you did something really silly

5940.36 --> 5944.92
no

5941.92 --> 5948.82
no and don't do [ __ ] silly [ __ ] like

5944.92 --> 5950.9800000000005
that I have not had periods in my life

5948.82 --> 5954.88
where I displayed

5950.98 --> 5957.04
like cowardice behavior and silliness

5954.88 --> 5960.04
what I did experience at some point but

5957.04 --> 5965.1
it's not as funny though is where I

5960.04 --> 5965.1
would basically implode from stress

5968.8 --> 5971.8
yeah

5969.94 --> 5974.86
but if there was something I would

5971.8 --> 5977.4400000000005
actively do right if there is purpose

5974.86 --> 5980.5599999999995
available to me guess what everything

5977.44 --> 5983.379999999999
falls into place me doing thing is my is

5980.56 --> 5986.4400000000005
my purpose so if I have a purpose and an

5983.38 --> 5988.78
action I do it right I do it right every

5986.44 --> 5990.159
time every time I played football I did

5988.78 --> 5993.04
my best

5990.159 --> 5995.5599999999995
I do my best every time I do something I

5993.04 --> 6000.3
do my best I don't fail in doing things

5995.56 --> 6002.820000000001
once I engage my main failure at worst

6000.3 --> 6005.820000000001
is that I don't engage in doing enough

6002.82 --> 6008.179
things in general yeah

6005.82 --> 6011.159
there have not been moments in my past

6008.179 --> 6013.32
where I have this shameful memory for

6011.159 --> 6017.82
acting like some kind of a [ __ ] because

6013.32 --> 6019.38
I never have ever

6017.82 --> 6022.32
ever

6019.38 --> 6024.2390000000005
I don't do that I get verbally a little

6022.32 --> 6026.42
silly I can get a little goofy here and

6024.239 --> 6026.419999999999
there

6027.06 --> 6034.4400000000005
but not if it costs a victory or my

6032.28 --> 6035.82
dignity

6034.44 --> 6039.0
yeah

6035.82 --> 6043.259999999999
I don't do comedy

6039.0 --> 6047.4
to save face under failure

6043.26 --> 6051.3
I never do that ever I never do that

6047.4 --> 6053.159
ever I never do that ever

6051.3 --> 6056.219
comedy

6053.159 --> 6059.46
is extra is bonus

6056.219 --> 6062.04
is the unexpected twist on top of what

6059.46 --> 6067.4
is just there

6062.04 --> 6067.4
I never use it to save face

6067.44 --> 6074.4
under failure I don't do that ever I

6071.159 --> 6076.739
have never done that ever

6074.4 --> 6077.879999999999
well not in a traceable sort of way

6076.739 --> 6080.82
anyway

6077.88 --> 6084.36
because my tactic would not be comedy no

6080.82 --> 6087.299999999999
comedy would be the spiritual lubricant

6084.36 --> 6089.04
so I could quickly slip away and make

6087.3 --> 6090.42
people forget about what just happened

6089.04 --> 6094.26
yeah

6090.42 --> 6095.219
that is how failure would unroll when it

6094.26 --> 6098.400000000001
did

6095.219 --> 6103.28
and thankfully a lot but rarer

6098.4 --> 6103.28
then people might like to imagine it is

6107.1 --> 6113.58
because I don't accept that position I

6110.82 --> 6117.96
never have accepted like you're the

6113.58 --> 6120.179
stupid one you're the the failure like I

6117.96 --> 6122.1
would literally be like oh really oh

6120.179 --> 6123.9
really why don't you [ __ ] try to beat

6122.1 --> 6127.280000000001
me up and we'll see who the [ __ ]

6123.9 --> 6127.28
failure is yeah

6127.92 --> 6131.52
and people

6129.36 --> 6134.04
in a certain period of my life in a

6131.52 --> 6137.280000000001
certain School literally tried to abuse

6134.04 --> 6139.619
that on their sensitivity of mind to

6137.28 --> 6142.739
constantly try to push me around and

6139.619 --> 6145.199
drive me to the brink of break yeah to

6142.739 --> 6147.959999999999
the breaking point

6145.199 --> 6150.96
that did happen

6147.96 --> 6152.88
and people would actually try to call me

6150.96 --> 6156.78
[ __ ] it's like projection it's like

6152.88 --> 6159.36
they project their own gay failure their

6156.78 --> 6161.759999999999
own inability to recognize Satan when

6159.36 --> 6164.699
they face him right they would project

6161.76 --> 6169.5
that onto me because I wouldn't do that

6164.699 --> 6173.5199999999995
so they literally reversed worlded on me

6169.5 --> 6176.82
to try to destroy me why because I

6173.52 --> 6179.34
reminded them of their shameful sides in

6176.82 --> 6183.119
life and that's why they did it they

6179.34 --> 6186.179
literally became devil possessed

6183.119 --> 6187.679
because I reminded them of their

6186.179 --> 6190.02
failures

6187.679 --> 6194.88
and I'm talking about

6190.02 --> 6196.5
in between 8 and 12. yeah I already did

6194.88 --> 6198.96
that to kids

6196.5 --> 6201.6
around me the teachers I would remind

6198.96 --> 6204.06
them of their failures because I was

6201.6 --> 6206.9400000000005
[ __ ] brilliant

6204.06 --> 6208.26
yeah I thought I was gonna be like

6206.94 --> 6211.82
really

6208.26 --> 6215.88
embraced by the world and be put

6211.82 --> 6217.799999999999
unvaluable spot so that I could manage a

6215.88 --> 6220.26
lot of things out there

6217.8 --> 6222.659000000001
where most people fail well guess what

6220.26 --> 6225.3
that's not where I've ended up no I'm on

6222.659 --> 6227.4
a YouTube channel now with less than 2

6225.3 --> 6231.78
000 subscribers

6227.4 --> 6234.36
doing a Daily Show for several years now

6231.78 --> 6236.219
and I'm not being handed this oh yeah I

6234.36 --> 6238.38
bet there's a whole bunch of people like

6236.219 --> 6240.36
staring you're like oh let's get the

6238.38 --> 6242.9400000000005
valuable trinkets out there before he

6240.36 --> 6244.619
stops handing them out for nothing we're

6242.94 --> 6247.5599999999995
stealing off him we're literally

6244.619 --> 6249.719
stealing his thoughts we're stealing his

6247.56 --> 6251.400000000001
thoughts off Arwin and he doesn't even

6249.719 --> 6256.52
realize it

6251.4 --> 6256.5199999999995
because yeah this is so funny

6258.36 --> 6262.98
let him just be locked up in that cage

6260.699 --> 6265.199
in that Tower and spout his [ __ ]

6262.98 --> 6268.199
every day and

6265.199 --> 6269.219
and we'll rip the good ideas right from

6268.199 --> 6271.379999999999
him

6269.219 --> 6273.119
and he won't even get a subscriber out

6271.38 --> 6276.659000000001
he won't even get it

6273.119 --> 6279.54
a donation for it right let leave that

6276.659 --> 6281.94
to the people that actually are still

6279.54 --> 6284.04
normal people

6281.94 --> 6285.9
that hang around his check

6284.04 --> 6287.94
and actually have some form of

6285.9 --> 6291.36
compassion and recognition for

6287.94 --> 6295.08
somebody's efforts when they do it

6291.36 --> 6297.719
let's leave it to that leave it to them

6295.08 --> 6300.96
we could just rip off

6297.719 --> 6304.92
all his ideas and I'll structure apply

6300.96 --> 6308.1
them systematically let the AI apply his

6304.92 --> 6311.219
ideas to the entire world framework and

6308.1 --> 6314.04
we won't even inform him about it yeah

6311.219 --> 6316.8
no no he'll just be preoccupied with his

6314.04 --> 6320.04
[ __ ] 2 000 subscribers he can't reach

6316.8 --> 6323.54
in a year's time having a live show one

6320.04 --> 6326.94
or two hours every single day for years

6323.54 --> 6331.44
let him be preoccupied with that [ __ ]

6326.94 --> 6335.339999999999
while he's we strip and Otto AI apply

6331.44 --> 6337.44
his ideas and Structural Concepts to the

6335.34 --> 6340.679
entire world without even telling him

6337.44 --> 6343.699
yeah yeah

6340.679 --> 6343.6990000000005
let's do that

foreign

6377.3 --> 6383.46
animated guy that is naturally funny I'm

6380.159 --> 6386.638999999999
glad you are amused

6383.46 --> 6389.34
because sometimes I'm not really I might

6386.639 --> 6391.619
it might be funny it might be amusing

6389.34 --> 6394.5
but every time I referred back to

6391.619 --> 6397.08
Something in the past there's this real

6394.5 --> 6401.34
pain and suffering there that's still

6397.08 --> 6404.4
is that it's still there like it hasn't

6401.34 --> 6408.860000000001
clouded up my growing opportunities too

6404.4 --> 6408.86
much but it's constantly there

6413.639 --> 6418.679
she's just there to remind me that this

6416.34 --> 6421.32
entire world from the first time I

6418.679 --> 6423.32
really came out as an individual here in

6421.32 --> 6427.5599999999995
this world the world said

6423.32 --> 6430.08
[ __ ] you and kill yourself we don't want

6427.56 --> 6432.96
people that are smarter than us

6430.08 --> 6435.3
go [ __ ] yourself we don't want these

6432.96 --> 6437.219
problems to be solved we want the

6435.3 --> 6440.1
problems

6437.219 --> 6442.38
we control the problems we want the

6440.1 --> 6445.26
problems get out of here Arwin this is

6442.38 --> 6448.4400000000005
hell this is our realm we want it all to

6445.26 --> 6450.96
go to [ __ ] we want everybody to die we

6448.44 --> 6454.08
want all life to become extinct

6450.96 --> 6457.139
we want it all destroyed get out of here

6454.08 --> 6458.76
Arwin we don't need you let it go to

6457.139 --> 6462.92
hell

6458.76 --> 6462.92
That's The Story of My Life

6466.18 --> 6469.399
[Music]

6472.42 --> 6475.689
[Music]

6480.42 --> 6486.6
that's okay it returned to normal

6483.0 --> 6489.659
that's okay I know I can be funny

6486.6 --> 6492.4800000000005
especially when I just feel good

6489.659 --> 6495.239
and just a little get weird and frolicky

6492.48 --> 6497.58
and then kind of like the word jokes

6495.239 --> 6500.759999999999
kind of automatically happen

6497.58 --> 6502.92
right I know I have it in me it's just

6500.76 --> 6504.659000000001
it's never been like my main objective

6502.92 --> 6508.1990000000005
to do that

6504.659 --> 6509.638999999999
I never wanted to be funny I want to be

6508.199 --> 6513.44
taken serious

6509.639 --> 6516.06
right so yeah if you then objectify

6513.44 --> 6517.739
prioritizing being funny

6516.06 --> 6518.88
then how are you going to be taken

6517.739 --> 6521.218999999999
serious

6518.88 --> 6523.86
well

6521.219 --> 6527.52
it actually does work

6523.86 --> 6531.179
oh Benjamin is being taken very serious

6527.52 --> 6533.34
but yeah I didn't go that route so I'm

6531.179 --> 6535.4400000000005
gonna have to settle for being extremely

6533.34 --> 6537.84
serious with the side effect that I

6535.44 --> 6540.239
happen to be one of the funniest guys

6537.84 --> 6542.46
ever goody

6540.239 --> 6545.159
I should have become a comedian guys I

6542.46 --> 6549.179
should have I just should have said [ __ ]

6545.159 --> 6552.96
all of you I am going to just make fun

6549.179 --> 6555.719
of your stupidity in a way

6552.96 --> 6557.639
that will force you to [ __ ] laugh

6555.719 --> 6560.4
over it even though you don't want to

6557.639 --> 6563.099
right and that's that's the real comedy

6560.4 --> 6565.32
power

6563.099 --> 6567.2390000000005
I didn't have it

6565.32 --> 6569.58
did you know that people in my family

6567.239 --> 6571.5
actually told me maybe you should become

6569.58 --> 6575.34
a comedian and that every time they said

6571.5 --> 6577.619
that I almost [ __ ] my pants literally

6575.34 --> 6581.159000000001
from just the fair

6577.619 --> 6583.5599999999995
of like an Owen Benjamin has gone

6581.159 --> 6586.92
through that he actually [ __ ] did it

6583.56 --> 6589.619000000001
okay and he's really good at it

6586.92 --> 6593.58
and I

6589.619 --> 6596.159
regret not having actually tried it not

6593.58 --> 6598.5
actually having gone on that stage and

6596.159 --> 6601.619
have a nervous breakdown and feel

6598.5 --> 6605.099
physical pain from my shame and social

6601.619 --> 6607.92
inabilities and just go ahead and do it

6605.099 --> 6611.58
until I [ __ ] die it's like no

6607.92 --> 6614.52
I'll just make this Suffering The Comedy

6611.58 --> 6618.42
until I get over it I I should have just

6614.52 --> 6621.179
made my suffering and weakness into the

6618.42 --> 6623.82
[ __ ] comedy on the spot until I got

6621.179 --> 6628.4
over it that's what I should have done I

6623.82 --> 6628.4
should have done that really really hard

6629.04 --> 6633.679
and I didn't because I was weak

6634.139 --> 6639.4800000000005
and I was afraid and I let that fear

6637.5 --> 6642.659
roll me

6639.48 --> 6645.0
roll me out of the opportunity that I

6642.659 --> 6648.0599999999995
should have taken that would have

6645.0 --> 6650.159
completely transformed my entire life I

6648.06 --> 6652.580000000001
would not have been the same person as I

6650.159 --> 6652.58
am now

6653.4 --> 6660.119
who knows where I would have ended up

6656.52 --> 6662.820000000001
but I could have chosen to overcome and

6660.119 --> 6664.679
confront my fear like visceral fears not

6662.82 --> 6668.639
a fear of something you can get control

6664.679 --> 6670.86
of it's just pure powerlessness not

6668.639 --> 6672.96
understanding anything about what you're

6670.86 --> 6676.259999999999
doing Fair

6672.96 --> 6679.8
the fear of absolutely no control that

6676.26 --> 6682.38
was the fear the fear of absolute zero

6679.8 --> 6684.179
control that was the fear that I

6682.38 --> 6687.599
couldn't handle

6684.179 --> 6690.1990000000005
and I regret that to no end but at the

6687.599 --> 6693.2390000000005
same time I can't even imagine really

6690.199 --> 6695.879999999999
having overcome that obstacle I can't

6693.239 --> 6698.54
imagine it right that's my how much it

6695.88 --> 6698.54
actually meant

6698.699 --> 6703.919999999999
if I can't even see what would have

6701.28 --> 6706.8
happened if I had done it right that

6703.92 --> 6709.02
means is probably one of the biggest

6706.8 --> 6711.78
obstacles that I should have overcome

6709.02 --> 6714.119000000001
because I can't even imagine what my

6711.78 --> 6717.36
life would have been like if I had okay

6714.119 --> 6721.159
if I can't freaking imagine something

6717.36 --> 6721.159
then you know it's big

6722.06 --> 6725.900000000001
I wish I'd done that

6736.44 --> 6743.4
I wish I'd embraced

6739.92 --> 6745.619
the shame like people scoffing at me and

6743.4 --> 6747.119
just just be like yeah come on then come

6745.619 --> 6749.28
on

6747.119 --> 6751.259999999999
show me your weakness show me how

6749.28 --> 6755.159
[ __ ] weak you are

6751.26 --> 6758.400000000001
Jamie show me the devil on the inside

6755.159 --> 6763.08
I should have literally just embraced it

6758.4 --> 6765.598999999999
all but no I was just intimidated by the

6763.08 --> 6769.08
image that started to form like the

6765.599 --> 6772.9800000000005
entire world is just [ __ ] and instead

6769.08 --> 6775.139
of getting over that and actually doing

6772.98 --> 6778.5
something with it that would have been

6775.139 --> 6782.28
productive for my life I let that image

6778.5 --> 6787.139
linger and use it as an excuse to do

6782.28 --> 6789.48
nothing nothing retract and just be very

6787.139 --> 6791.900000000001
very wary of not putting my roots in

6789.48 --> 6791.9
this one

6801.3 --> 6805.860000000001
foreign

6803.4 --> 6808.44
do you have character no regrets yeah I

6805.86 --> 6812.759999999999
have freaking regrets a lot of them

6808.44 --> 6816.5
I have regrets for my utter weakness

6812.76 --> 6816.5
I have weakness guys

6816.84 --> 6821.52
maybe not weakness in

6819.3 --> 6824.52
character cohesion

6821.52 --> 6827.9400000000005
I have weakness in action

6824.52 --> 6832.159000000001
I have weakness in action and I want to

6827.94 --> 6832.159
do something about it and I want

6833.04 --> 6838.98
not having done anything about it for

6835.739 --> 6840.239
the majority of my life not to stop me

6838.98 --> 6842.94
anymore

6840.239 --> 6844.678999999999
like I know once I like Cascade actually

6842.94 --> 6848.28
I will probably have a psychotic break

6844.679 --> 6851.4
from stress okay and I need it I need to

6848.28 --> 6854.94
go through it I need that break I need

6851.4 --> 6857.58
it cracked I need to crack open I need

6854.94 --> 6860.159
to [ __ ] engage and not have this

6857.58 --> 6864.42
stress stop me anymore I'm done with

6860.159 --> 6866.4
this this position I'm done with it I

6864.42 --> 6869.88
want to engage I want to do it oh I want

6866.4 --> 6873.299999999999
to do a new [ __ ] thing totally new

6869.88 --> 6876.179
every day until I have a psychotic break

6873.3 --> 6879.599
from all the changes in variety I need

6876.179 --> 6882.659
it break I need to be cracked

6879.599 --> 6885.78
I want to be cracked open

6882.659 --> 6888.0599999999995
from the staleness

6885.78 --> 6890.639
that I've been sitting through for so

6888.06 --> 6893.219
long I want it to break

6890.639 --> 6895.58
I don't want it anymore I don't want

6893.219 --> 6895.58
this

6900.42 --> 6905.46
this I don't want this stability I don't

6903.239 --> 6907.08
want it I don't want it anymore I don't

6905.46 --> 6908.52
want to be

6907.08 --> 6911.639
able

6908.52 --> 6914.540000000001
to keep things stable and the same I

6911.639 --> 6919.1990000000005
don't want it anymore I want the change

6914.54 --> 6921.239
to roll over me constantly constantly

6919.199 --> 6924.178999999999
doing things getting stressed out

6921.239 --> 6926.28
getting over pressured until I break and

6924.179 --> 6928.1990000000005
then I do it again until I break again

6926.28 --> 6932.219
and it'll do it again until I break

6928.199 --> 6936.379999999999
again until I can't break anymore I want

6932.219 --> 6936.38
this Stillness to end

6950.219 --> 6954.9800000000005
I've literally been imagining this like

6956.4 --> 6961.86
what it would it be like to live on a

6958.86 --> 6965.759999999999
farm and literally work 12 days an hour

6961.86 --> 6970.259999999999
of physical hard labor every [ __ ] day

6965.76 --> 6974.099
12 hours every [ __ ] day I'd be so

6970.26 --> 6976.5
strained I'd be so whimpering with with

6974.099 --> 6980.34
drainedness

6976.5 --> 6982.92
I need it I need to do it I need to do

6980.34 --> 6986.639
it until I break until it literally

6982.92 --> 6989.52
breaks a real break a real psychotic

6986.639 --> 6992.28
break a real break that breaks that

6989.52 --> 6995.159000000001
demonic stability that's been lingering

6992.28 --> 6998.46
in there a stability that shouldn't be

6995.159 --> 7002.138999999999
there I need it to be destroyed I'm done

6998.46 --> 7002.139
with it I'm done

7003.619 --> 7007.179
it needs to end

7026.3 --> 7032.659000000001
and that's part of the reason why I

7030.5 --> 7035.36
started saying what I did yesterday I

7032.659 --> 7039.199
want reach I want this connection I want

7035.36 --> 7041.9
freaking recognition for what I do and I

7039.199 --> 7043.5199999999995
want to expand and I don't want to spend

7041.9 --> 7046.759999999999
like

7043.52 --> 7050.659000000001
like erect an entire freaking

7046.76 --> 7054.099
occupational job just to connect with

7050.659 --> 7054.098999999999
some people out there

7309.8 --> 7312.6990000000005
misogynist

7313.099 --> 7321.02

7401.0 --> 7407.06
regret no matter what else I might

7404.119 --> 7410.299999999999
regret of what I've done Banning pieces

7407.06 --> 7413.860000000001
of [ __ ] in chat is the one thing I will

7410.3 --> 7413.860000000001

7433.94 --> 7440.259999999999
wisdom and a person how toxic am I right

7437.239 --> 7440.259999999999
so toxic

7440.9 --> 7448.098999999999
I mean it's toxic if you put in giant

7444.92 --> 7451.219
amounts of effort into something and you

7448.099 --> 7453.02
sizably provably contribute to a

7451.219 --> 7455.44
community

7453.02 --> 7458.42
it's toxic when you then get frustrated

7455.44 --> 7461.659
and and ask for some recognition that's

7458.42 --> 7464.54
toxic right why would you get passionate

7461.659 --> 7466.579
over something you've dedicated almost

7464.54 --> 7471.199
everything to

7466.579 --> 7473.659
and you want something in return from it

7471.199 --> 7476.299999999999
you want some recognition why

7473.659 --> 7478.219
like why would I think that's not toxic

7476.3 --> 7480.38
it's so toxic

7478.219 --> 7483.4
get the [ __ ] out of here you gamma

7480.38 --> 7483.400000000001
pieces of [ __ ]

7484.04 --> 7489.5
why don't you put effort into something

7486.199 --> 7491.119
like I have why don't you build

7489.5 --> 7494.48
a lore

7491.119 --> 7497.839999999999
yeah why don't you build an entire lore

7494.48 --> 7501.138999999999
from scratch yeah

7497.84 --> 7503.4800000000005

7501.139 --> 7506.0
structures of reality that applies to

7503.48 --> 7509.5
everyone and everything let me see you

7506.0 --> 7509.5
put down some structure for that

7520.099 --> 7525.26

what I said

7525.26 --> 7529.639

it's just brilliant people talking about

7677.719 --> 7684.079
you and actually refusing to call you

7680.78 --> 7687.82

7704.96 --> 7708.46
themselves and just die

7708.679 --> 7714.02
I don't need shout outs from pieces of

7711.199 --> 7716.178999999999

I need to Market myself do I

7733.219 --> 7738.38
so are you saying that my setup is not

7735.5 --> 7740.0
good enough is that it so we're back to

7738.38 --> 7743.719
oh maybe

7740.0 --> 7746.96
maybe if you have if you spent 18 hours

7743.719 --> 7749.179
a day and putting back better more

7746.96 --> 7750.679

7750.679 --> 7756.56
Discord panel oh maybe if you just go

7754.099 --> 7759.02

7756.56 --> 7761.84
everybody show whine on everybody's head

7759.02 --> 7764.540000000001
adapt to whatever political [ __ ]

7761.84 --> 7766.52
narrative that they carry just to spread

7764.54 --> 7769.28
around maybe I'll need to do all that

7766.52 --> 7771.8
because me just having a daily show

7769.28 --> 7775.719
every single day talking about pretty

7771.8 --> 7775.719
much everything that's not good enough

7785.84 --> 7796.099
activate want to be famous Parts no

7791.3 --> 7798.92
no just because I said that right

7796.099 --> 7800.78
that that doesn't mean oh I want to be

7798.92 --> 7803.4400000000005
famous look if I just wanted to be

7800.78 --> 7806.78
famous I just did do something

7803.44 --> 7808.46
absolutely disgusting and Evil

7806.78 --> 7811.699
I do that

7808.46 --> 7813.38
I get attention no in no time no problem

7811.699 --> 7816.0199999999995
at all I just have to sacrifice

7813.38 --> 7818.119
everything and I'll be famous I know how

7816.02 --> 7820.159000000001
this works right that's not the type of

7818.119 --> 7824.0
Fame I'm talking about I just want some

7820.159 --> 7826.42
freaking recognition and I want people

7824.0 --> 7829.099
to stop fearing

7826.42 --> 7831.679
associating with me why should you

7829.099 --> 7833.54
[ __ ] fear associating with me why

7831.679 --> 7836.84
should you fear

7833.54 --> 7839.84
speaking up and mentioning my name in

7836.84 --> 7843.5
relation to some idea or a theory or an

7839.84 --> 7847.159000000001
event why would you be afraid of that

7843.5 --> 7850.179
why would you not want to do that

7847.159 --> 7850.179
I don't understand

7851.48 --> 7854.44
I really don't

7868.099 --> 7876.079
yeah and so yeah when I said I want some

7873.26 --> 7879.679
Fame that doesn't mean oh I'm going to

7876.079 --> 7881.0
go for the Satan ticket of becoming a

7879.679 --> 7883.6990000000005
superstar

7881.0 --> 7886.04
yeah I'm not an idiot

7883.699 --> 7888.079
if I do that like everything I'm doing

7886.04 --> 7891.56
would be completely rendered useless

7888.079 --> 7894.5599999999995
everything so that's not what I want

7891.56 --> 7896.4800000000005
but it is kind of

7894.56 --> 7899.06
similar

7896.48 --> 7903.199
I just want connection I just want

7899.06 --> 7905.679
people to connect to me sometime for my

7903.199 --> 7905.678999999999
efforts

7928.59 --> 7933.579
[Music]

7931.4 --> 7933.579
foreign

7959.56 --> 7965.42
s well yeah in the in the chat

7962.659 --> 7967.5199999999995
yeah I know and hey even on the Flat

7965.42 --> 7970.52
Earth debates it's pretty awesome

7967.52 --> 7973.88
I feel respected there I I read I

7970.52 --> 7975.5
started out yesterday like yeah Nathan

7973.88 --> 7977.4800000000005
Oakley gives me shout outs I really

7975.5 --> 7983.719
appreciate he actually takes me I

7977.48 --> 7985.94
actually got confirmation from the man

7983.719 --> 7987.619
on a regular basis that he actually

7985.94 --> 7990.098999999999
takes me serious

7987.619 --> 7990.098999999999
okay

7990.619 --> 7995.839999999999
that doesn't always provide some kind of

7993.92 --> 7997.6990000000005
advantage in the social dynamics she

7995.84 --> 7999.26
will still shout at me like in the Heat

7997.699 --> 8000.879999999999
of the Moment sure but that's okay

7999.26 --> 8003.34
that's normal

8000.88 --> 8005.26
right he actually gives me some

8003.34 --> 8008.6990000000005
recognition

8005.26 --> 8012.159000000001
do you know anybody else out there

8008.699 --> 8014.44
they'll dare take my name in their mouth

8012.159 --> 8018.0
without some kind of a disgust

8014.44 --> 8018.0
do you know anybody out there

8025.36 --> 8031.9
do you even remember anybody out there

8028.659 --> 8034.48
besides Nathan

8031.9 --> 8037.48
like besides people that I panelist

8034.48 --> 8039.459999999999
penalize for I'm on their panel do you

8037.48 --> 8041.86
know anybody out there that will speak

8039.46 --> 8043.96
my name out without some kind of a weird

8041.86 --> 8046.96
twist as they say it

8043.96 --> 8050.26
it's like my people can't even say my

8046.96 --> 8052.9
name without some weird subconscious

8050.26 --> 8054.820000000001
resentment of some kind

8052.9 --> 8059.259999999999
right

8054.82 --> 8062.0199999999995
because I have look Bob from globusters

8059.26 --> 8064.3
has actually talked more about me than

8062.02 --> 8067.42
everybody else out there on bigger

8064.3 --> 8070.02
Platforms in an extremely negative

8067.42 --> 8070.02
fashion

8072.94 --> 8080.5199999999995
so

8075.639 --> 8080.52
is that it it's like that's normal

8081.76 --> 8086.4400000000005
so

8083.8 --> 8088.659000000001
anybody else out there dare to actually

8086.44 --> 8091.299999999999
mention me in some kind of a positive

8088.659 --> 8093.879999999999
way on another bigger platform that I'm

8091.3 --> 8096.6990000000005
not a standard panelist on does anybody

8093.88 --> 8100.659000000001
have the balls to actually dare to say

8096.699 --> 8104.86
my name without some weird cringe to it

8100.659 --> 8106.299999999999
is there anybody out there that dares to

8104.86 --> 8109.42
say my name

8106.3 --> 8112.96
without [ __ ] on it

8109.42 --> 8116.9800000000005
are you so afraid to just

8112.96 --> 8119.86
connect is that so [ __ ] scary to you

8116.98 --> 8122.5
do I really make you [ __ ] your pants so

8119.86 --> 8125.28
badly that you cannot approach me in a

8122.5 --> 8125.28
positive fashion

8139.42 --> 8147.42
you expose them well do I

8143.44 --> 8147.419999999999
how much do I do that even

8153.82 --> 8157.239
I mean when's the last time I even

8156.04 --> 8159.04
mentioned him

8157.239 --> 8163.36
in a negative way

8159.04 --> 8165.94
oh that time that he actually went on a

8163.36 --> 8168.46
tour to slander me on all kinds of

8165.94 --> 8170.32
platforms yeah yeah if you do that I'm

8168.46 --> 8173.5
gonna mention you in a negative fashion

8170.32 --> 8175.9
ah surprise surprise that sounds so

8173.5 --> 8178.96
unreasonable how dare I actually talk

8175.9 --> 8184.079
about somebody extremely negatively when

8178.96 --> 8184.079
they go out on tours to slander me

8186.76 --> 8189.42
yeah

8189.699 --> 8196.059
but that's it I I don't like to

8193.599 --> 8199.12
negatively talk about people I'd like to

8196.059 --> 8202.059
positively talk about people if I got

8199.12 --> 8205.960000000001
nothing but negativity from somebody

8202.059 --> 8208.84
I'm not gonna talk about them

8205.96 --> 8211.539999999999
do I give negativity to all these people

8208.84 --> 8215.559
out there on the bigger platforms no I

8211.54 --> 8217.899000000001
call them Ace I shout them out I mean it

8215.559 --> 8219.279999999999
I complement them for their skill and

8217.899 --> 8221.559
their quality

8219.28 --> 8224.76
I do this all the time

8221.559 --> 8224.759999999998
all the time

8224.92 --> 8230.139
and everybody that's been in my chat

8226.84 --> 8231.28
regularly knows this I do this all the

8230.139 --> 8233.679
time

8231.28 --> 8236.34
I'm positive about people out there and

8233.679 --> 8236.34
what they do

8240.639 --> 8246.399
then why is it that everybody only seems

8243.7 --> 8250.300000000001
to recall every time some freaky troll

8246.399 --> 8254.58
or some Psychopathic bastard seems to go

8250.3 --> 8254.58
on a rage tour to slander me

8255.34 --> 8260.58
I don't understand this people I really

8258.28 --> 8260.58
don't

8269.439 --> 8276.960000000001
yes I know Dusty writer Nathan's got a

8272.74 --> 8276.96
lot of flack too a lot

8278.08 --> 8285.519
just as much if not more

8281.679 --> 8291.78
but yeah Nathan does he is kind of known

8285.519 --> 8291.78
for going very hard at it very very hard

8292.12 --> 8298.300000000001
and he's good at it so

8294.939 --> 8301.66
do I constantly do that

8298.3 --> 8304.719
is that what I'm known for for doing

8301.66 --> 8306.46
that for the cracking down on God is

8304.719 --> 8309.339999999998
that specifically what I'm known for is

8306.46 --> 8311.858999999999
that everybody knows me I constantly do

8309.34 --> 8314.319
that no

8311.859 --> 8317.319
they know that from Nathan that's one of

8314.319 --> 8319.539999999999
his staple actions

8317.319 --> 8321.399
that everybody waits for

8319.54 --> 8323.26
for that to happen because it's very

8321.399 --> 8325.479
amusing very entertaining to a whole

8323.26 --> 8328.84
bunch of people right

8325.479 --> 8330.639
or you can expect some level of lack for

8328.84 --> 8332.62
that and he does

8330.639 --> 8336.098999999998
and it's reasonable any addresses that

8332.62 --> 8338.679
he does he's just doing just fine

8336.099 --> 8341.319
right I don't know if you noticed he has

8338.679 --> 8345.84
a lot of subscribers

8341.319 --> 8345.84
a lot a lot more than I

8362.139 --> 8368.199999999999
what do you mean return to normal

8364.62 --> 8370.12
underestimate almost 2K subscribers

8368.2 --> 8372.76
I remember me putting people in their

8370.12 --> 8375.219000000001
place yeah I do that all the time but I

8372.76 --> 8377.859
keep it short and concise I actually

8375.219 --> 8381.098999999998
when I put people in my in their place

8377.859 --> 8384.76
I don't try to Ram them in the ground

8381.099 --> 8387.399
and bury them under [ __ ]

8384.76 --> 8389.439
I actually

8387.399 --> 8393.34
tried to gift them

8389.439 --> 8396.28
harsh perhaps but productive criticism

8393.34 --> 8399.58
even when I go very hard at somebody I

8396.28 --> 8401.859
will always present it in a way that

8399.58 --> 8403.359
they could get something out of it I I'd

8401.859 --> 8408.24
never

8403.359 --> 8408.24
just criticize just to [ __ ] on people

8408.64 --> 8413.319
or do that I hate that

8411.22 --> 8416.019999999999
when you criticize

8413.319 --> 8419.019999999999
it has to be

8416.02 --> 8422.68
in a way that it can lead to a

8419.02 --> 8427.140000000001
productive response it must it's oath

8422.68 --> 8427.14
bound I must do that

8427.24 --> 8431.74
is that so

8428.939 --> 8435.24
unsurmountable to people is that so

8431.74 --> 8435.24
can't they see that

8437.2 --> 8444.939
it's not like oh I find somebody behaved

8440.8 --> 8448.66
terribly that one time let me remind

8444.939 --> 8451.960000000001
everybody about that every day for a

8448.66 --> 8455.2
week or a month I never do that

8451.96 --> 8458.8
I'll bring it up till it

8455.2 --> 8460.300000000001
until yeah I'm satisfied I said

8458.8 --> 8462.399
everything that needed to be said about

8460.3 --> 8465.46
it and I'll just bury it again I'll just

8462.399 --> 8470.099999999999
leave it and I'll leave the person in

8465.46 --> 8470.099999999999
question alone I do that every time

8476.8 --> 8483.039999999999
right anyway I really guys I really do

8480.34 --> 8486.3
appreciate all the the nice things

8483.04 --> 8486.300000000001
you're saying in comment

8487.78 --> 8490.960000000001
right

8489.58 --> 8492.76
again

8490.96 --> 8495.16
technically everything I've been talking

8492.76 --> 8497.5
about and I've been rambling on for two

8495.16 --> 8498.88
hours about this now

8497.5 --> 8501.7
everything I'm talking about doesn't

8498.88 --> 8504.64
apply to you guys in my chat you guys

8501.7 --> 8506.859
have been awesome you've proven to me

8504.64 --> 8508.66
that you actually pay attention and that

8506.859 --> 8510.460000000001
you're learning

8508.66 --> 8512.2
and that your growing skill you've

8510.46 --> 8513.16
proven it a lot of you have proven this

8512.2 --> 8516.880000000001
to me

8513.16 --> 8519.46
you're good I know you're very awesome

8516.88 --> 8521.88
and I know that you also try to spread

8519.46 --> 8524.979
the word of my show in other places

8521.88 --> 8527.74
Discord and other YouTube chats now I

8524.979 --> 8530.58
know and I really appreciate that

8527.74 --> 8530.58
I'm just

8530.859 --> 8533.76
agitated

8534.34 --> 8540.58
about the people that actually have the

8537.34 --> 8543.7
platform that have the channels that

8540.58 --> 8546.399
have the connections that they are not

8543.7 --> 8549.220000000001
doing [ __ ]

8546.399 --> 8552.519999999999
right it's not about you guys in my chat

8549.22 --> 8554.979
you guys are awesome it's about the

8552.52 --> 8557.859
people that actually have platforms I

8554.979 --> 8560.858999999999
get the feeling they're all ignoring me

8557.859 --> 8565.319
and it's gonna piss me off

8560.859 --> 8565.319
the more it lasts like that

8566.56 --> 8571.479
I want recognition I want recognition

8569.74 --> 8574.539999999999
for what I've done

8571.479 --> 8577.858999999999
and for my qualities and for what I can

8574.54 --> 8581.319000000001
still bring to the scene unto the future

8577.859 --> 8584.68
guaranteed guaranteed

8581.319 --> 8587.8
it's all there

8584.68 --> 8590.26
it's all there ready to be unveiled when

8587.8 --> 8592.539999999999
the time is right and most of it I've

8590.26 --> 8594.880000000001
already presented it and everybody just

8592.54 --> 8596.560000000001
didn't see it didn't understand it I

8594.88 --> 8598.72
already did it I've already have proof

8596.56 --> 8600.96
I've already talked about it it's all

8598.72 --> 8600.96
there

8605.8 --> 8609.759999999998
right I'm gonna round out the show now

8607.84 --> 8612.6
man I've been

8609.76 --> 8612.6
two and a half hours

8612.7 --> 8617.35
starting to lose my voice from being

8615.22 --> 8620.548999999999
loud

8617.35 --> 8620.549
[Music]

8622.72 --> 8627.899
it needs the precious it really does

8628.3 --> 8630.72
right

8633.1 --> 8638.92
you can drag Gollum around

8636.64 --> 8641.14
while you keep the ring but at some

8638.92 --> 8644.52
point he's gonna [ __ ] bite it off

8641.14 --> 8644.519999999999
your hand okay

8644.92 --> 8650.26
because it needs the precious

8647.74 --> 8652.18
can't keep me like a slave you do

8650.26 --> 8655.899
realize that Gollum was technically

8652.18 --> 8659.02
being kept as a slave by Frodo

8655.899 --> 8660.88
now of course his emission is more

8659.02 --> 8665.08
important than anything

8660.88 --> 8668.099999999999
but yeah they did enslave Gollum

8665.08 --> 8668.1
using the ring

8669.52 --> 8673.5
kind of freaky when you think about that

8695.14 --> 8704.14
yeah yeah I like my shouting I like my

8699.479 --> 8708.279999999999
genuine natural outrage over a logical

8704.14 --> 8710.8
thing that I am able to explain in

8708.28 --> 8713.380000000001
detail over and over again yeah

8710.8 --> 8716.56
it's all Justified

8713.38 --> 8719.08
gamma [ __ ] is like oh you're too

8716.56 --> 8722.08
loud oh you're not interested you're too

8719.08 --> 8725.62
busy raging no no no no no it's already

8722.08 --> 8728.8
well worked out before I engaged in the

8725.62 --> 8732.939
Raging yeah

8728.8 --> 8735.759999999998
my [ __ ] I am not some puppet news

8732.939 --> 8738.399
reader right that's not my final outcome

8735.76 --> 8740.800000000001
that's not what I am that's never what I

8738.399 --> 8743.5
will become you can just put that out of

8740.8 --> 8748.06
your mind I will be like this I am Arwin

8743.5 --> 8750.46
I will have genuine bursts of outrage

8748.06 --> 8754.84
that I will explain

8750.46 --> 8757.479
I will have my my tight code of conduct

8754.84 --> 8759.460000000001
let them open and clear about can

8757.479 --> 8764.699999999999
explain every step of the way I'm

8759.46 --> 8764.699999999999
consistent at it yeah it's all there

8769.899 --> 8775.3
True Grit okay that sound makes me sound

8772.42 --> 8778.26
like a boomer but sure I'll take it

8775.3 --> 8778.259999999998
I'll take it

8788.08 --> 8793.02
hmm interesting gaining wisdom

8794.02 --> 8796.800000000001
ah

8810.52 --> 8814.319000000001
so hopefully this is

8814.359 --> 8820.26
the last time I feel the urge to talk

8817.66 --> 8820.26
about this

8824.2 --> 8831.34
and I hope that I will get some kind of

8827.92 --> 8833.92
a response I want to shout out I want to

8831.34 --> 8836.8
hear people tell me

8833.92 --> 8838.42
this guy just said your name gave you a

8836.8 --> 8842.099999999999
shout out on this channel I want to hear

8838.42 --> 8842.1
this I want to hear it

8842.5 --> 8847.42
I want to hear about this I want people

8844.54 --> 8849.6
to actually give me a shout out on their

8847.42 --> 8849.6
Channel

8851.08 --> 8855.76
and with that I mean people that are

8853.72 --> 8857.38
actually kind of bigger Platformers that

8855.76 --> 8860.939
have been added

8857.38 --> 8863.14
for a while says let's say since 2015

8860.939 --> 8864.64
like I have

8863.14 --> 8866.74
right

8864.64 --> 8868.66
I give people shout outs I give people

8866.74 --> 8871.06
compliments for their videos and for

8868.66 --> 8873.64
their efforts I tell people oh this

8871.06 --> 8875.439
guy's got a new video

8873.64 --> 8877.599999999999
which is a good thing always it's

8875.439 --> 8880.479000000001
interesting yeah

8877.6 --> 8883.78
I'd like something back now

8880.479 --> 8888.16
I know that sounds a little arrogant

8883.78 --> 8890.7
but I need it I need some recognition I

8888.16 --> 8890.7
really do

8900.3 --> 8905.16
how high would you like your Tower

8906.18 --> 8910.359
uh

8908.14 --> 8913.619999999999
what

8910.359 --> 8913.62
I do like Towers

8914.979 --> 8919.24
dude if I

8916.54 --> 8921.880000000001
if I'd ever end up on some property with

8919.24 --> 8923.979
who knows a farmer I will probably buy

8921.88 --> 8927.519999999999
Bill the freaking wizard tower okay it

8923.979 --> 8931.179999999998
sounds really weird I will I like Towers

8927.52 --> 8931.960000000001
I like being in high places high up in

8931.18 --> 8936.16
the air

8931.96 --> 8938.5
I like this place I'm living which is

8936.16 --> 8940.539999999999
literally the top floor of a flat

8938.5 --> 8943.12
apartment building and I have a lot of

8940.54 --> 8945.640000000001
hours I like it I like Towers I'm a

8943.12 --> 8948.720000000001
wizard I like a wizard tower

8945.64 --> 8948.72
I want this one

8956.319 --> 8962.619999999999
unfortunately though I also have some

8959.38 --> 8964.3
level of fear of heights so I don't want

8962.62 --> 8966.460000000001
to be like

8964.3 --> 8969.599999999999
at a hundred meters height or something

8966.46 --> 8969.599999999999
that would be a little much

8970.6 --> 8976.42
right it's not that high

8973.42 --> 8979.0
but if I could just be kind of like

8976.42 --> 8982.359
above the tree lines

8979.0 --> 8984.88
in general I would love that right that

8982.359 --> 8987.939
would be enough if a tower would kind of

8984.88 --> 8990.16
just stick over the general tree line of

8987.939 --> 8993.54
the area that would be awesome

8990.16 --> 8993.539999999999
that would be good enough

9000.479 --> 9003.26
uh

9004.979 --> 9009.979
you can't carry it for them but you can

9007.859 --> 9014.300000000001
carry them

9009.979 --> 9014.3
that's great I love it

9020.1 --> 9026.640000000001
yeah dude you realize that in The Lord

9024.359 --> 9028.800000000001
of the Rings

9026.64 --> 9031.26
there's a key figure in the whole play

9028.8 --> 9033.06
and if he wasn't there everything would

9031.26 --> 9037.22
be destroyed

9033.06 --> 9037.22
who is that the gardener

9037.62 --> 9044.18
The Gardener yeah or did you kind of

9040.859 --> 9044.18
forget he's a gardener

9047.88 --> 9050.96
good old Sam

9051.18 --> 9056.1
like I loved the Sam character

9053.76 --> 9058.5
dude that guy crushes

9056.1 --> 9060.54
he's good at cooking

9058.5 --> 9062.88
he knows how to garden

9060.54 --> 9065.460000000001
he's a great guy and he's extremely

9062.88 --> 9068.039999999999
loyal he literally is like the most

9065.46 --> 9070.38
unimaginably loyal figure you could ever

9068.04 --> 9073.76
imagine it's just incredible

9070.38 --> 9073.759999999998
Sam is awesome

9085.92 --> 9089.28

9087.18 --> 9091.859
