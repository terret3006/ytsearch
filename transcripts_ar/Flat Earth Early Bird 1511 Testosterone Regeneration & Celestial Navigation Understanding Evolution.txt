93.24 --> 101.82
uh not out of the woods just yet

96.659 --> 106.159
right the weather today is just gorgeous

101.82 --> 106.15899999999999
it's really beautiful

113.46 --> 119.46
Pure Blue Sky

115.979 --> 122.53999999999999
no wind not even a little

119.46 --> 122.53999999999999
bright Sun

123.24 --> 127.15899999999999
no Trail Haze today

133.319 --> 137.45899999999997
and yeah birds are enjoying it like

136.14 --> 139.26
there's not a lot of bickering even

137.459 --> 141.66
among the birds

139.26 --> 146.04
or anything

141.66 --> 148.2
a lot lots of bird uh singing also I'm

146.04 --> 150.06
noticing but that's been like for a few

148.2 --> 153.72
days but especially

150.06 --> 156.18
yesterday and this morning

153.72 --> 159.54
just I'm hearing more little birds

156.18 --> 162.9
singing so that's really nice and

159.54 --> 165.599
yeah spring is coming back baby well at

162.9 --> 167.22
least in these days it feels like it

165.599 --> 169.459
I mean it's probably gonna get colder

167.22 --> 169.459
tomorrow

169.739 --> 175.62
if I trust the uh weather forecast from

172.98 --> 178.099
yesterday we'll see if that is now also

175.62 --> 178.09900000000002
changed

178.379 --> 184.01899999999998
it said yesterday it would be sunny that

181.56 --> 185.81900000000002
day and this day and then cloudy again

184.019 --> 187.68
tomorrow

185.819 --> 191.23899999999998
so we'll see

187.68 --> 191.239
because I'm gonna check the weather

200.22 --> 204.42
yeah

201.72 --> 207.18
I thought today let's start exactly on

204.42 --> 208.55999999999997
time for a change

207.18 --> 211.739
uh

208.56 --> 215.28
anyway it is Tuesday the 14th of

211.739 --> 215.28
February 2023

219.0 --> 222.14
and I feel great

222.659 --> 228.62
this ashwagandha stuff

225.42 --> 228.61999999999998
is something else

230.72 --> 235.08
[Music]

232.56 --> 238.04
yesterday the entire day I had like

235.08 --> 239.81900000000002
remarkable

238.04 --> 243.659
differences

239.819 --> 248.0
that I noticed with interaction

243.659 --> 248.0
because I went out for groceries and

250.56 --> 255.12
I got for groceries before the show or

253.379 --> 257.459
after

255.12 --> 259.62
no after

257.459 --> 261.479
yeah and just

259.62 --> 264.72
people

261.479 --> 266.639
like that normally like don't really pay

264.72 --> 268.38000000000005
attention to me or they probably there's

266.639 --> 270.12
something about me that it is like that

268.38 --> 272.94
I but they're very modest and nice

270.12 --> 275.46
people still right

272.94 --> 278.96
it's just people have issues and I me

275.46 --> 281.58
too and they do and but that day

278.96 --> 283.68
everywhere I went and I went in several

281.58 --> 287.28
places like people were like really like

283.68 --> 289.38
forthcoming and eager to please me

287.28 --> 290.46
that was weird

289.38 --> 291.84
it's like

290.46 --> 293.82
okay

291.84 --> 297.79999999999995
what's going on

293.82 --> 301.56
am I such a great person now like what

297.8 --> 304.56
that was really odd

301.56 --> 304.56
but

305.04 --> 310.02000000000004
apparently it makes me more assertive or

307.5 --> 312.24
something than

310.02 --> 316.56
confident

312.24 --> 318.96000000000004
really probably so it's interesting

316.56 --> 321.78000000000003
and certainly welcome

318.96 --> 323.69899999999996
right but I do have to figure out like I

321.78 --> 326.4
don't know much about this stuff

323.699 --> 328.02000000000004
ashwagandha

326.4 --> 330.0
I don't know what the long-term

328.02 --> 331.74
consequences would be

330.0 --> 334.259
so

331.74 --> 337.199
but it's thus far been pretty damn

334.259 --> 339.0
amazing I also need to consult my healer

337.199 --> 341.58000000000004
about what he's reading about it whether

339.0 --> 344.46
it's actually good or not for me even it

341.58 --> 347.15999999999997
might seem good but maybe as detrimental

344.46 --> 349.79999999999995
effects in some way I don't know

347.16 --> 351.06
can be a bit tricky but thus far it's

349.8 --> 354.32
been pretty

351.06 --> 354.32
yeah I'm interesting

355.08 --> 360.78
like

357.18 --> 364.22
far beyond anything that I expected it

360.78 --> 364.21999999999997
to do when I took it

366.479 --> 372.139
some unexpected bonuses anyway so yeah

369.06 --> 372.139
been great

372.539 --> 375.38
feeling great

376.1 --> 383.52000000000004
cleaning up some stuff

379.74 --> 386.34000000000003
it also just made me mix I get more

383.52 --> 388.02
impulses to actually do stuff too like

386.34 --> 391.44
naturally it's

388.02 --> 392.69899999999996
like wow anyway hey that flat fellow

391.44 --> 396.56
good to see you

392.699 --> 396.56
Sue what

400.02 --> 404.28
okay

402.419 --> 407.59999999999997
hey it's been a while man I haven't seen

404.28 --> 407.59999999999997
you in a while how are you doing

413.699 --> 418.74
ah

415.319 --> 420.97900000000004
right anyway had some Reflections on

418.74 --> 420.979
yesterday

421.86 --> 424.91900000000004
thank you

422.94 --> 426.78
and we're of course immediately some

424.919 --> 428.53999999999996
troll comments about oh he's talking

426.78 --> 430.08
about killing people

428.54 --> 433.88
[Music]

430.08 --> 433.88
and still makes me think like

435.9 --> 439.58
it is a bit much isn't it

441.18 --> 446.759
but I mean it's I explain it I mean it's

444.96 --> 449.63899999999995
literally

446.759 --> 452.06
it's come from trauma I pretty much laid

449.639 --> 452.06
it down

452.46 --> 460.5
without like actually revealing

456.74 --> 462.0
details but the pattern and like roughly

460.5 --> 463.68
what happened

462.0 --> 464.759
I witnessed something that I couldn't

463.68 --> 468.479
handle

464.759 --> 470.16
and it broke me and this was on the

468.479 --> 471.479
other side of that

470.16 --> 474.56
and it's

471.479 --> 474.56
just like

479.9 --> 485.75899999999996
at first

482.88 --> 487.8
when they started to manifest I kept it

485.759 --> 489.58000000000004
in like locked in like I don't want

487.8 --> 491.28000000000003
anything anybody to see that

489.58 --> 493.8
[Music]

491.28 --> 496.25899999999996
right because when it did come out it

493.8 --> 498.3
would be complete Madness like way worse

496.259 --> 499.68
than what you guys ever get to see

498.3 --> 502.139
[Music]

499.68 --> 503.699
but just pure it would be ego based and

502.139 --> 506.40000000000003
a great because it would not be under

503.699 --> 508.86
control I'd always try to escape from it

506.4 --> 510.9
and if it then unleashes it just becomes

508.86 --> 515.219
pure ravenous

510.9 --> 518.9399999999999
like a ravenous dog just tearing [ __ ] up

515.219 --> 521.099
or the tendency to that

518.94 --> 523.86
right and when that would happen I would

521.099 --> 526.1400000000001
actually deflect it back on myself which

523.86 --> 528.42
is insane

526.14 --> 530.9399999999999
I wouldn't actually like start damaging

528.42 --> 534.3
myself but like psychologically locking

530.94 --> 536.519
all that Terror and extreme energy in

534.3 --> 539.0999999999999
like a cage but that deflects it right

536.519 --> 541.5
back onto me and that is

539.1 --> 543.899
dangerous

541.5 --> 547.86
literally like if you have that too much

543.899 --> 550.5
you you just lose your mind like you

547.86 --> 553.14
break you get brain damage I think

550.5 --> 556.399
so I always that was the initial

553.14 --> 556.399
strategy to deal with it

559.5 --> 563.779
eventually it just went dormant

564.72 --> 572.1
and the

567.959 --> 574.1999999999999
the Reversed World State basically miled

572.1 --> 577.6800000000001
it down

574.2 --> 578.58
it became more tame and it was there for

577.68 --> 580.92
a while

578.58 --> 583.44
but it became much more tame so it

580.92 --> 586.92
became much more like a weird atheist it

583.44 --> 589.6800000000001
was really like a microcosm

586.92 --> 591.899
within the amnesios that is so weird

589.68 --> 593.5799999999999
that might yeah it sounds a bit vague

591.899 --> 596.04
now as I'm described he's not the most

593.58 --> 599.72
eloquent way to describe it but I'm

596.04 --> 599.7199999999999
trying to rush through it the pattern

601.2 --> 609.0
and then well then 82 happened and I

605.94 --> 611.339
basically was pushed to that point where

609.0 --> 614.64
I had to choose like either I put on

611.339 --> 616.62
that reflective cage and basically

614.64 --> 619.1999999999999
damage myself

616.62 --> 622.5600000000001
or I'm just gonna show it

619.2 --> 625.08
and do do something crazy like actually

622.56 --> 628.26
show it on the show that to everyone to

625.08 --> 630.26
see to basically oppose my initial fear

628.26 --> 633.779
that kept me

630.26 --> 638.279
doing that which is very destructive on

633.779 --> 641.3389999999999
the long run and would keep reoccurring

638.279 --> 644.279
so it was my literal breakout I smashed

641.339 --> 647.1600000000001
the cage and let everybody see

644.279 --> 650.279
and because I did it under control

647.16 --> 652.8
because I wasn't pushed in a corner for

650.279 --> 655.8
that to happen

652.8 --> 658.74
I had the choice I could have also just

655.8 --> 660.24
like turn off the stream immediately and

658.74 --> 663.6
walk away

660.24 --> 666.3
but then I because I chose

663.6 --> 670.82
to show it I had

666.3 --> 670.8199999999999
a whole different range of control

672.06 --> 675.7199999999999
it was like backed by Honor all of a

674.22 --> 678.24
sudden and I had a different range of

675.72 --> 679.74
control as to when that happens when you

678.24 --> 681.9590000000001
get cornered and it's completely

679.74 --> 685.0790000000001
uncontrollable

681.959 --> 686.9399999999999
as the ego gets involved in fear and all

685.079 --> 691.3199999999999
that

686.94 --> 693.6800000000001
right so that's how that then came to be

691.32 --> 696.48
I mean it was literally that

693.68 --> 698.399
manifestation form to that level it was

696.48 --> 700.2
the first time ever that I've ever done

698.399 --> 701.94
that

700.2 --> 705.32
except

701.94 --> 705.32
maybe to a degree

705.42 --> 710.16
with my mother but it wasn't too great

708.36 --> 712.2
at controlling because she went like

710.16 --> 715.98
freaking

712.2 --> 718.5600000000001
bullying mad at me

715.98 --> 720.839
like actually harassing me because she

718.56 --> 722.279
was like completely out of her mind and

720.839 --> 725.399
angry

722.279 --> 727.68
because of well probably my dad who

725.399 --> 729.18
wasn't even living there

727.68 --> 730.62
and she would even tell me that I

729.18 --> 733.7399999999999
reminded

730.62 --> 737.339
of hit of him and all that it's just a

733.74 --> 740.4590000000001
horrific situation home situation

737.339 --> 742.0790000000001
trying to any sensible person and I

740.459 --> 745.079
wasn't

742.079 --> 747.7199999999999
because I went through crazy [ __ ] any

745.079 --> 751.68
sensible person would actually just move

747.72 --> 754.0790000000001
out but I I was afraid to because I

751.68 --> 757.7399999999999
I didn't trust myself

754.079 --> 760.62
because I was crazy now I was trying to

757.74 --> 761.899
contain this

760.62 --> 765.3
this

761.899 --> 768.779
vengeful violence somehow

765.3 --> 770.639
that I couldn't deal with

768.779 --> 773.22
and I was hiding it from everybody

770.639 --> 775.86
because it's like if anybody gets to see

773.22 --> 778.5600000000001
that like I'll never get a job or

775.86 --> 781.5600000000001
something ever again and people are like

778.56 --> 783.68
gonna look really angry at me on the

781.56 --> 783.68
street

788.339 --> 792.3800000000001
anyway so yeah sorry it's a bit intense

791.16 --> 796.139
maybe

792.38 --> 799.38
all of a sudden it was just really kind

796.139 --> 800.82
of Weighing on me and it would and it in

799.38 --> 803.279
a way

800.82 --> 807.62
that I thought I could still just roll

803.279 --> 807.62
it out productively and comprehensible

808.32 --> 815.48
just work a lot right

811.86 --> 815.48
oh that's good fellow

816.3 --> 821.18
hope you're still uh crushing it out

818.94 --> 821.1800000000001
there

823.079 --> 828.0
all right my eyes to sue nothing I'm

825.959 --> 831.0
getting eye problems well there could be

828.0 --> 836.1
several reasons could be

831.0 --> 838.079
poor sleep or staring at a screen too

836.1 --> 840.3000000000001
much especially if you're staring at

838.079 --> 841.8599999999999
your Mobile screen because those are

840.3 --> 844.68
quite burdensome on the eyes if you do

841.86 --> 846.1800000000001
that like a lot especially if you're

844.68 --> 848.6999999999999
really in the zone

846.18 --> 850.68
you're gonna get eye problems

848.7 --> 852.24
because it's really unnatural for your

850.68 --> 855.38
eyes to do that

852.24 --> 855.38
when you're that intense

856.44 --> 860.22
could that be it

858.36 --> 862.62
and by the way the same counts just even

860.22 --> 864.5400000000001
for a monitor screen it's less than with

862.62 --> 867.12
a mobile but if you like do that for

864.54 --> 868.56
your work and you're literally just all

867.12 --> 870.66
day all day like

868.56 --> 873.2399999999999
staring at the screen typing staring at

870.66 --> 874.38
this it's gonna [ __ ] with your eyes it

873.24 --> 877.98
will

874.38 --> 880.82
maybe less than with the old glass tube

877.98 --> 882.9590000000001
televisions because those had other

880.82 --> 884.94
compounding problems the radiation

882.959 --> 887.16
problems

884.94 --> 890.0400000000001
bad for the eyes but

887.16 --> 893.1
even just having your eyes set in that

890.04 --> 895.38
way and your mind specifically focused

893.1 --> 897.48
into like reading off a certain screen

895.38 --> 899.22
and you do that long you're going to get

897.48 --> 901.399
eye problems

899.22 --> 903.899
foreign

901.399 --> 905.399
unless you're really sensitive in

903.899 --> 906.959
noticing it and then you have to take

905.399 --> 909.86
breaks

906.959 --> 909.8599999999999
regularly

913.079 --> 919.5699999999999
right I might be over advising a bit and

916.38 --> 923.179
just I got a lot of energy

919.57 --> 923.1790000000001
[Music]

923.88 --> 929.06
very eager to see other people joining

926.699 --> 929.06
as well

929.699 --> 933.7199999999999
because

930.899 --> 936.68
yeah I mean if this effect that I've

933.72 --> 936.6800000000001
been having out there

938.16 --> 942.899
is gonna be

940.68 --> 945.2399999999999
Universal

942.899 --> 946.8
then I think that even people in my chat

945.24 --> 950.22
might just

946.8 --> 953.639
start to act differently now

950.22 --> 955.38
not saying that you must or anything

953.639 --> 957.12
it's just that there's something that's

955.38 --> 960.56
changed about me because of this stuff

957.12 --> 960.5600000000001
yeah ashwagandha

967.139 --> 971.94
you could say I feel

969.139 --> 975.0
unexpectedly stable on

971.94 --> 979.22
a higher level that I'm just totally

975.0 --> 979.22
not used to for a long time

979.62 --> 985.139
I haven't felt this stable

982.56 --> 987.779
since I was with

985.139 --> 991.26
with my ex-girlfriend like in the first

987.779 --> 994.22
two years when I was really crushing it

991.26 --> 994.22
energy wise

997.56 --> 1002.079
right and I'm not even in love

1002.959 --> 1008.1199999999999
well basically even then it was

1004.82 --> 1008.12
different because

1010.699 --> 1013.699
foreign

1016.24 --> 1020.66
let's not get into that I don't want to

1018.74 --> 1024.579
think about my ex but

1020.66 --> 1024.579
anyway I feel great

1029.0 --> 1034.0
fueling systems oh okay

1031.699 --> 1038.8390000000002
well

1034.0 --> 1041.72
gases like Benzene type gases that you

1038.839 --> 1044.54
that are involved with fuels over time

1041.72 --> 1047.059
can also wear on your eyes it's really

1044.54 --> 1049.28
toxic to your eyes if yeah that's why if

1047.059 --> 1052.34
you're like concentrated guess it really

1049.28 --> 1054.44
hurts it's like ah right well you're

1052.34 --> 1059.62
getting probably

1054.44 --> 1059.6200000000001
micro exposures since you're doing that

1060.38 --> 1066.44
or are you not

1063.26 --> 1068.78
is it so perfectly engineered that

1066.44 --> 1071.299
literally nothing ever not even a drop

1068.78 --> 1073.22
spills oh you smell fuel all day okay

1071.299 --> 1075.62
then there you go

1073.22 --> 1077.72
yeah

1075.62 --> 1081.02
fuel can be

1077.72 --> 1084.44
pretty dangerous for the body

1081.02 --> 1087.08
like one time yeah it's it might be

1084.44 --> 1090.559
gross or something like

1087.08 --> 1092.8999999999999
but if you continually get exposed on a

1090.559 --> 1096.74
regular basis it is really toxic

1092.9 --> 1098.8400000000001
it's similar to issues like I've

1096.74 --> 1103.4
like when I was in my late teens I

1098.84 --> 1104.72
worked at a for as a temp

1103.4 --> 1108.5590000000002
at a

1104.72 --> 1110.9
a printing shop where they like a

1108.559 --> 1112.3999999999999
like a sort of a factory where they

1110.9 --> 1114.74
would just print

1112.4 --> 1119.0
on things

1114.74 --> 1121.1
like label printing on like pens and all

1119.0 --> 1124.82
kinds of things like company labels

1121.1 --> 1127.3999999999999
mostly but they were constantly freaking

1124.82 --> 1129.32
gases everywhere and it had a massive

1127.4 --> 1130.8200000000002
detrimental effect

1129.32 --> 1132.799
because

1130.82 --> 1133.9399999999998
well they were not all that careful with

1132.799 --> 1135.559
it even

1133.94 --> 1138.6200000000001
and then

1135.559 --> 1141.28
I actually went to the manager and

1138.62 --> 1143.8999999999999
basically went all Jew on him

1141.28 --> 1146.059
just joke and didn't bring up any

1143.9 --> 1147.02
religion or Jew or anything it's just

1146.059 --> 1149.539
that I

1147.02 --> 1151.46
I'm joking but I went to him and said

1149.539 --> 1152.9
like this is irresponsible like you have

1151.46 --> 1155.539
to do something about you can't just

1152.9 --> 1157.039
make people

1155.539 --> 1159.799
like

1157.039 --> 1161.84
put their hands in I don't know if the

1159.799 --> 1164.12
name is the same in English tinner it's

1161.84 --> 1167.8999999999999
like this

1164.12 --> 1170.4799999999998
paint remover just a bucket of paint

1167.9 --> 1174.2
remover liquid right there

1170.48 --> 1175.4
with and you then have like this stuff

1174.2 --> 1177.98
in there

1175.4 --> 1180.74
and you grab it in there with your hands

1177.98 --> 1182.72
without any gloves and there's no

1180.74 --> 1184.88
suction so you're like in the middle

1182.72 --> 1187.82
like that was like completely they asked

1184.88 --> 1191.2990000000002
me to do that and I got like really sick

1187.82 --> 1194.299
I said like this is insane

1191.299 --> 1197.48
you people do that regularly you are out

1194.299 --> 1200.0
of your minds like that is so freaking

1197.48 --> 1202.7
brain damaging so I went to the manager

1200.0 --> 1204.98
said like you this is irresponsible you

1202.7 --> 1206.48
have to have it like some kind of

1204.98 --> 1209.0
suction system for when people

1206.48 --> 1210.02
specifically do that task because this

1209.0 --> 1212.419
is like

1210.02 --> 1215.48
terrible

1212.419 --> 1216.98
it's like irresponsible medically like

1215.48 --> 1218.66
even if they agree to it it's

1216.98 --> 1220.82
irresponsible

1218.66 --> 1222.98
and there will be people

1220.82 --> 1225.02
that my temp worked there and then be

1222.98 --> 1227.66
forced to do that it's just

1225.02 --> 1230.059
irresponsible so I actually put him on

1227.66 --> 1232.24
the spot to do something about it and he

1230.059 --> 1232.24
did

1232.4 --> 1239.44
and everybody was when I got back there

1234.919 --> 1239.44
another time everybody was weirded out

1239.72 --> 1246.039
because nobody had actually just stood

1242.539 --> 1246.039
up and said anything about it

1247.039 --> 1249.58
nobody

1251.299 --> 1255.26
but it was there now and people were

1253.16 --> 1257.3600000000001
using it and everybody did realize that

1255.26 --> 1259.76
it was a lot better

1257.36 --> 1262.76
it was such a

1259.76 --> 1264.679
bad in like everybody there was like

1262.76 --> 1266.0
completely irresponsible they didn't

1264.679 --> 1267.98
care about anything

1266.0 --> 1269.539
about themselves about their health it

1267.98 --> 1270.98
was a really bad atmosphere in

1269.539 --> 1273.08
retrospect

1270.98 --> 1275.6
and I took a stand

1273.08 --> 1278.48
right but

1275.6 --> 1281.48
those types of chemicals and with fuel

1278.48 --> 1283.94
and jet fuel probably even worse

1281.48 --> 1286.419
yeah that stuff is bad for you for

1283.94 --> 1286.419
breathing

1286.9 --> 1294.679
like

1289.84 --> 1297.6789999999999
so yeah but also for your eyes

1294.679 --> 1297.679
foreign

1300.76 --> 1305.02
so you got to be careful with that

1305.059 --> 1309.1399999999999
sounds a bit weird in this time and age

1307.039 --> 1312.76
but maybe like have a doctor check that

1309.14 --> 1312.76
as specifically an eye doctor

1313.22 --> 1318.8600000000001
like the check like whether you might

1316.58 --> 1322.6399999999999
need to do something about it

1318.86 --> 1324.62
because maybe it could get worse and you

1322.64 --> 1328.1000000000001
don't want that

1324.62 --> 1329.9599999999998
do you flat that flat feather

1328.1 --> 1332.24
I mean your eyes are kind of important

1329.96 --> 1335.32
these days especially if you're going to

1332.24 --> 1335.32
be active on the internet

1337.49 --> 1341.4
[Music]

1346.659 --> 1351.1000000000001
oh Jesus zap tabby

1352.15 --> 1355.249
[Music]

1357.08 --> 1360.34
yeah that's messed up

1363.62 --> 1369.26
and ridiculous because I mean

1366.799 --> 1372.34
I think some basic ventilation is really

1369.26 --> 1372.34
not that big of a deal

1372.5 --> 1378.26
yeah you have some initial installation

1375.2 --> 1380.3600000000001
costs you can't even keep it pretty

1378.26 --> 1382.76
basic although yeah there might if

1380.36 --> 1384.74
there's like burning dangers

1382.76 --> 1387.14
might it might be a little bit worse but

1384.74 --> 1389.96
it's just one initial investment

1387.14 --> 1392.96
and then look at all the freaking

1389.96 --> 1394.58
medical costs you save

1392.96 --> 1397.46
because

1394.58 --> 1400.82
there's a chance that people that are

1397.46 --> 1404.059
working through that that they might in

1400.82 --> 1406.58
retrospect get basically be do about it

1404.059 --> 1409.58
and doing it again

1406.58 --> 1411.86
and then like yeah you cost me all these

1409.58 --> 1414.5
problems I want money now

1411.86 --> 1416.4189999999999
right even though you might have just

1414.5 --> 1419.059
completely agreed to it while you were

1416.419 --> 1421.2800000000002
working there or didn't even realize it

1419.059 --> 1426.1399999999999
that can still happen so it's just

1421.28 --> 1429.26
better to preemptively just do that

1426.14 --> 1433.3400000000001
bit more investment and then save on

1429.26 --> 1435.82
health issues and long-term costs

1433.34 --> 1435.82
anyway

1445.159 --> 1451.7800000000002
yeah well fumes are pretty [ __ ] up

1448.159 --> 1451.7800000000002
didn't realize how bad it right

1453.74 --> 1458.2
well that is just problematic because

1458.32 --> 1465.2
I consider that in a way abuse

1461.78 --> 1467.44
from the person that is organizing that

1465.2 --> 1467.44
job

1467.72 --> 1473.48
because yeah or youngsters

1470.539 --> 1474.679
They Don't Really they have no wide

1473.48 --> 1477.6200000000001
knowledge

1474.679 --> 1479.0
of what is bad for you and all that and

1477.62 --> 1480.3999999999999
they think they're all tough they can

1479.0 --> 1483.2
handle anything

1480.4 --> 1486.8600000000001
I know all about that

1483.2 --> 1488.9
when they can't and so it should be up

1486.86 --> 1492.26
to the people that are older and wiser

1488.9 --> 1495.679
and organizing that to reassure that

1492.26 --> 1498.08
well they don't needlessly damage their

1495.679 --> 1502.0400000000002
Workforce

1498.08 --> 1502.04
[Music]

1505.18 --> 1511.28
[Music]

1507.98 --> 1513.2
so learn from it yeah you went through

1511.28 --> 1515.1789999999999
that sucks

1513.2 --> 1518.659
well keep in mind

1515.179 --> 1521.0
you know how that goes

1518.659 --> 1523.3400000000001
you might be able to do something about

1521.0 --> 1526.82
it to help prevent

1523.34 --> 1528.02
well as you said losing seven years of

1526.82 --> 1530.059
your life

1528.02 --> 1534.039
with other people

1530.059 --> 1534.039
that are cool cool guys

1540.38 --> 1542.8600000000001
right

1544.279 --> 1548.6
anyway

1545.48 --> 1551.2
or family or whatever anyway hey LSG

1548.6 --> 1551.1999999999998
good to see you

1552.44 --> 1556.64
yeah at least G has his own story uh

1554.9 --> 1559.46
concerning

1556.64 --> 1562.0
poisoning on the work floor haven't you

1559.46 --> 1562.0
LG

1562.46 --> 1570.22
it's kind of yeah I guess that's

1565.779 --> 1570.22
a bit of a theme now today

1585.5 --> 1588.86
right anyway I hope all of you are

1587.299 --> 1592.1589999999999
enjoying the show and are having a good

1588.86 --> 1594.9189999999999
day this I hope it is as beautiful a

1592.159 --> 1597.94
weather as it is over here because it is

1594.919 --> 1597.94
really amazing looking

1598.34 --> 1601.24
see

1604.96 --> 1611.5
what was the type I didn't check the

1608.419 --> 1611.5
temperature yet I should

1612.94 --> 1617.8600000000001
hey slugs metal slugs master

1618.74 --> 1622.0
I haven't seen you in a while

1622.82 --> 1627.34
uh Nick come on damn it

1637.159 --> 1643.7
11 degrees Celsius right

1640.039 --> 1646.72
oh and it still says it misty tomorrow

1643.7 --> 1646.72
what is that

1648.44 --> 1653.38
what does that mean little wavy lines

1653.659 --> 1659.5
is that mist

1656.659 --> 1659.5
looks weird

1664.4 --> 1668.6000000000001
is that or does that mean it's going to

1666.74 --> 1671.5
be chemtrailed or something like what

1668.6 --> 1671.5
what is that

1672.62 --> 1676.58
fog right

1678.42 --> 1685.96
[Music]

1681.44 --> 1685.96
having a good day yeah man I feel great

1699.7 --> 1703.539
severely nearsighted

1705.5 --> 1711.26
right so you're just like a details here

1708.32 --> 1713.0
you see a lot of detail up close but you

1711.26 --> 1716.14
can't see [ __ ] after a certain distance

1713.0 --> 1716.14
I get it

1721.039 --> 1725.6589999999999
I'm very lucky to see a lot of detail

1723.799 --> 1728.059
but not

1725.659 --> 1730.4
have any real eyesight problems because

1728.059 --> 1735.3999999999999
I've always my entire life starting very

1730.4 --> 1735.4
young been very careful with my eyes

1737.24 --> 1739.36
thank you

1752.779 --> 1756.22
most of the time anyway

1756.62 --> 1761.299
I mean in my teens when I was like

1758.74 --> 1763.58
really high on weed I might have done

1761.299 --> 1765.799
some stupid things but

1763.58 --> 1767.6
like never got my eyes hurt or anything

1765.799 --> 1770.48
or

1767.6 --> 1773.24
I probably stared in the Sun a couple of

1770.48 --> 1775.88
times but even then not that long

1773.24 --> 1777.98
relatively in does seem like everything

1775.88 --> 1780.5590000000002
as restored I mean there's a couple of

1777.98 --> 1782.74
little detail issues

1780.559 --> 1786.799
like

1782.74 --> 1790.88
but also just my

1786.799 --> 1793.1
the brain part that regulates eyesight

1790.88 --> 1795.3200000000002
and all that it's just really good with

1793.1 --> 1797.1789999999999
me and it doesn't seem to be getting

1795.32 --> 1800.02
damaged it seems to be getting better

1797.179 --> 1803.1200000000001
over time actually

1800.02 --> 1804.5
it seems it was like really good all

1803.12 --> 1807.6789999999999
along

1804.5 --> 1810.62
but the toxicity and just not eating

1807.679 --> 1813.0800000000002
super healthy and all that and and being

1810.62 --> 1815.36
demoralized all of that

1813.08 --> 1817.279
just doesn't help it

1815.36 --> 1821.299
then you have all that detailed Vision

1817.279 --> 1823.779
but you just don't do anything with it

1821.299 --> 1823.779
because

1824.24 --> 1832.159
you can't really think too well visually

1827.74 --> 1834.3990000000001
now it's really bad it's like much

1832.159 --> 1837.679
better

1834.399 --> 1839.6
closer to when it was super young

1837.679 --> 1843.52
but

1839.6 --> 1843.52
I can do so much more with it

1850.34 --> 1852.82
right

1857.539 --> 1860.86
hey George Sanford

1861.32 --> 1866.5
Ohio yeah I know I saw that that was

1863.96 --> 1866.5
messed up

1870.98 --> 1873.76
this

1879.2 --> 1883.29
is

1880.11 --> 1883.29
[Music]

1892.88 --> 1897.8600000000001
formed

1895.34 --> 1900.4399999999998
hmm

1897.86 --> 1905.4189999999999
right

1900.44 --> 1907.88
I get it no yeah you don't injure your

1905.419 --> 1909.7990000000002
eye leading to being nearsighted that

1907.88 --> 1911.8400000000001
that's

1909.799 --> 1914.179
very unlikely

1911.84 --> 1918.6399999999999
if you become mere sighted it's it grows

1914.179 --> 1918.64
that way and that happens to some people

1925.34 --> 1929.4399999999998
hey jado good to see you

1934.52 --> 1940.4189999999999
wow by the way

1936.799 --> 1943.7
the whole situation uh kind of happening

1940.419 --> 1946.7
apparently between Owen Benjamin and Jim

1943.7 --> 1949.5800000000002
Bob no one's been like on a stream like

1946.7 --> 1951.6200000000001
making fun of [ __ ] as he always does but

1949.58 --> 1953.0
Stills being like really friendly but

1951.62 --> 1956.2399999999998
apparently

1953.0 --> 1959.26
Jim Bob's been having some real issues

1956.24 --> 1959.26
with what's happened

1960.02 --> 1964.34
I I noticed that when he threatened to

1962.659 --> 1966.2600000000002
ban me

1964.34 --> 1968.84
few days back

1966.26 --> 1971.6
but

1968.84 --> 1973.1589999999999
I didn't know was that like it was

1971.6 --> 1974.9599999999998
something that was I thought it was like

1973.159 --> 1978.8200000000002
to kind of blow over

1974.96 --> 1978.82
did not expect this to happen

1982.039 --> 1987.399
it's like timbops changed in a way I can

1984.919 --> 1987.3990000000001
feel it

1988.159 --> 1994.88
it's not a good change and he is yeah I

1991.94 --> 1998.179
mean he's the one right so he's I'm not

1994.88 --> 2002.5800000000002
gonna complain but it's it's himself so

1998.179 --> 2002.5800000000002
he's probably not happy about it and

2003.34 --> 2007.26
hope things will be all right for him

2009.46 --> 2013.72
sounds weird I don't mean it as a

2012.1 --> 2015.399
mean-spirited joke or anything but if he

2013.72 --> 2018.34
needs to talk

2015.399 --> 2020.6399999999999
on a really high level complicated or

2018.34 --> 2020.6399999999999
whatever

2020.799 --> 2024.58
then uh

2022.779 --> 2028.32
I'd love to hear him out whether it's

2024.58 --> 2028.32
public or behind the scene

2028.72 --> 2034.24
and I will yeah like I will not poke him

2031.72 --> 2036.1200000000001
or anything

2034.24 --> 2040.36
foreign

2036.12 --> 2043.539
I mean when I'm there in the chat during

2040.36 --> 2046.24
his shows I am very Pokey now

2043.539 --> 2049.48
I am poking

2046.24 --> 2051.339
I mean Big Bear Just lit that fire and I

2049.48 --> 2053.5
can't stop it

2051.339 --> 2056.2
I mean I'm not overdoing it I'm I'm

2053.5 --> 2058.72
trying to be but it's like

2056.2 --> 2061.06
I can't be neutral anymore like because

2058.72 --> 2065.08
this was a sitting issue and now I've

2061.06 --> 2068.98
seen the full response to that and I'm

2065.08 --> 2072.7
I'm a little troll trigger you could say

2068.98 --> 2075.339
also because of well he does that with

2072.7 --> 2079.56
other people too kind of shamelessly

2075.339 --> 2079.56
and now I'm kind of doing it to him

2082.96 --> 2086.82
because I need to see this resolved

2090.52 --> 2096.54
I mean Jim Bob really needs to figure

2092.619 --> 2096.54
some things out about himself

2099.4 --> 2104.98
and again I don't mean to be patronizing

2102.16 --> 2110.2
or anything like I feel for him because

2104.98 --> 2111.579
Jim Bob's a really awesome very gentle

2110.2 --> 2114.8799999999997
guy

2111.579 --> 2115.8390000000004
who can be a bit possessed by Loki but

2114.88 --> 2120.54
hey

2115.839 --> 2120.54
so can I right but he more

2123.94 --> 2128.46
I just do a little Loki around the

2125.68 --> 2128.46
corner sometimes

2128.98 --> 2131.16
foreign

2139.43 --> 2142.52
[Music]

2146.26 --> 2150.099
and I've been actually like really

2148.119 --> 2152.56
poking in this chat

2150.099 --> 2154.48
saying some things about

2152.56 --> 2156.4
like yeah

2154.48 --> 2158.8
so hermeneutics

2156.4 --> 2161.44
is basically the following of Hermes

2158.8 --> 2162.1600000000003
isn't it it's like the Hermes is in the

2161.44 --> 2164.64
word

2162.16 --> 2168.7
and I I didn't even Google that word

2164.64 --> 2171.7599999999998
it's just like yeah I mean Hermie

2168.7 --> 2173.7999999999997
is in there lit so it's probably from

2171.76 --> 2174.88
Hermes and Hermes was like the Greek god

2173.8 --> 2177.7000000000003
of

2174.88 --> 2179.2000000000003
transport and information is like of

2177.7 --> 2183.1189999999997
traffic

2179.2 --> 2183.1189999999997
Logistics and information

2183.52 --> 2188.5
so it's basically a tradition

2186.64 --> 2191.5
that

2188.5 --> 2191.5
re-interprets

2192.22 --> 2196.4199999999996
things that are literally described in

2194.38 --> 2199.6800000000003
the Bible

2196.42 --> 2202.3
and it's named after the Greek

2199.68 --> 2206.22
pantheonic god

2202.3 --> 2206.2200000000003
of information and traffic

2206.32 --> 2209.579
hmm hmm

2211.48 --> 2218.44
it seems like it might be a little

2215.28 --> 2221.8590000000004
suspicious you know

2218.44 --> 2224.619
but I don't know

2221.859 --> 2228.2999999999997
just be me

2224.619 --> 2228.3
or Hermes trim Augustus

2233.28 --> 2239.5600000000004
uh that I hadn't even considered that

2236.44 --> 2242.859
one seeking that is crazy

2239.56 --> 2246.099
but maybe like her my stream I guess

2242.859 --> 2248.56
this might even be like tied in

2246.099 --> 2252.48
with the old tradition in the indirect

2248.56 --> 2252.48
way it might be like brothers

2252.52 --> 2256.96
to the same thought

2254.619 --> 2259.06
so but I

2256.96 --> 2261.46
I mean Hermes trim I guess this is not

2259.06 --> 2264.4
really typically referenced lingually

2261.46 --> 2265.66
right we're talking about origins of

2264.4 --> 2267.579
words

2265.66 --> 2269.98
etymology nervous trim I guess this is

2267.579 --> 2273.88
not typically used as an etymological

2269.98 --> 2275.26
Source now they're Greek gods

2273.88 --> 2278.099
are

2275.26 --> 2278.099
definitely

2278.14 --> 2284.7599999999998
and some others too like other

2280.66 --> 2284.7599999999998
situations right other traditions

2286.18 --> 2290.68
so

2287.44 --> 2293.44
but that is that certainly made me like

2290.68 --> 2295.859
hmm you might have a point that

2293.44 --> 2295.859
at this point

2298.48 --> 2303.7
right but I thought that that was like

2301.839 --> 2305.92
yeah

2303.7 --> 2309.0989999999997
I mean you're talking about oh we're

2305.92 --> 2312.96
dark the Christianity and

2309.099 --> 2316.44
we just have a set of people that

2312.96 --> 2316.44
reinterpret the Bible

2317.859 --> 2322.119
or yeah I made a joke about it in Owen

2320.38 --> 2325.32
Benjamin's chat I'm gonna say it out

2322.119 --> 2325.32
loud now my show

2325.78 --> 2331.0
so Jim Bob has joined the hermeneutical

2328.359 --> 2333.339
industry

2331.0 --> 2340.02
and he's joining his brothers in doing

2333.339 --> 2340.02
gain of function research on scripture

2342.22 --> 2344.8799999999997
one

2344.92 --> 2347.92
more

2362.339 --> 2367.0789999999997
you guys didn't hear that

2367.66 --> 2371.0789999999997
I don't know

2369.099 --> 2374.26
we'll see

2371.079 --> 2376.7400000000002
it's probably early in the morning for a

2374.26 --> 2376.7400000000002
summer yeah

2380.68 --> 2385.18
right but I just find it like pretty

2382.9 --> 2387.2200000000003
ironic and hilarious I almost didn't

2385.18 --> 2390.7599999999998
like a big guy and an old Benjamin style

2387.22 --> 2393.16
way because he hasn't said this I when

2390.76 --> 2396.3590000000004
I'm the one to bring that up and

2393.16 --> 2396.359
Jim Bob's chat

2396.579 --> 2404.32
that like wait hermeneutics the the

2399.579 --> 2404.32
tradition of Priestly men philosophers

2404.52 --> 2411.4
that reinterpret the Bible

2408.599 --> 2413.98
bypassing just literal statements and

2411.4 --> 2418.079
reinterpreting them

2413.98 --> 2421.2400000000002
and it's named after the Greek god

2418.079 --> 2425.579
of information

2421.24 --> 2425.5789999999997
does that sound very Christian to you

2429.4 --> 2432.0
poke poke

2432.46 --> 2435.54
arto Rose

2436.54 --> 2442.83
got anything to say for yourself

2438.73 --> 2442.83
[Laughter]

2455.26 --> 2464.099
when I mow things over that's called

2458.079 --> 2464.099
metal slugs mastication of okay

2467.859 --> 2471.5989999999997
well you could do that but

2472.839 --> 2476.82
I don't think it would catch on

2477.82 --> 2480.96
it's quite a mouthful

2491.42 --> 2495.26
[Music]

2506.64 --> 2511.839
right anyway something that I've

2509.38 --> 2514.1800000000003
considered is that well if this actual

2511.839 --> 2515.92
gun has such a good influence on me

2514.18 --> 2519.5789999999997
and it feels so much more comfortable

2515.92 --> 2522.28
and even I guess I'm more appealing in

2519.579 --> 2526.0
ways to be certain people

2522.28 --> 2529.0
maybe I could actually just

2526.0 --> 2533.44
I'll not just focus more on Joy and love

2529.0 --> 2536.26
and all that but also on funny things

2533.44 --> 2539.32
people in my youth some people told me

2536.26 --> 2541.5400000000004
that I should be a comedian

2539.32 --> 2543.76
but

2541.54 --> 2545.5
all there was back then was like oh that

2543.76 --> 2546.94
means stand up that means standing on

2545.5 --> 2549.16
the stage in front of people and then

2546.94 --> 2550.48
talking well that was not very appealing

2549.16 --> 2552.46
to me at all

2550.48 --> 2554.2
concerning being funny because my

2552.46 --> 2556.48
funnyness always just

2554.2 --> 2558.3999999999996
typically comes spontaneous like in the

2556.48 --> 2560.26
moment I figure something out and then

2558.4 --> 2564.9
it rolls out

2560.26 --> 2564.9
it I can't like do that on command

2565.3 --> 2570.04
but maybe

2567.64 --> 2572.339
maybe I could just get more into that

2570.04 --> 2572.339
now

2575.2 --> 2580.8999999999996
I mean in the past like facing all that

2578.8 --> 2583.0600000000004
darkness really did make me lose my

2580.9 --> 2585.46
sense of humor in ways

2583.06 --> 2587.56
just didn't it it wouldn't happen

2585.46 --> 2589.7200000000003
anymore as much

2587.56 --> 2591.4
like I would see things that are

2589.72 --> 2594.9599999999996
technically funny but then I just

2591.4 --> 2594.96
wouldn't care about it being funny

2596.319 --> 2603.2799999999997
because well I felt like [ __ ] and it

2600.16 --> 2608.04
just wouldn't appeal to me that much

2603.28 --> 2608.0400000000004
so I didn't care too much about that

2610.06 --> 2615.099
so it was so different

2612.52 --> 2617.74
it's so weird like

2615.099 --> 2621.52
people even from my past when they see

2617.74 --> 2623.5
me they're like yeah you are really so

2621.52 --> 2626.14
the same

2623.5 --> 2627.64
but internally like there's so many

2626.14 --> 2632.2799999999997
changes

2627.64 --> 2632.2799999999997
but still it's just very much me

2634.24 --> 2640.0789999999997
the ways I do things never seems to have

2637.18 --> 2640.0789999999997
changed a lot

2640.359 --> 2643.619
expanded perhaps

2647.44 --> 2654.46
but the actual internal experiencing of

2652.06 --> 2656.44
that contemporary the whatever

2654.46 --> 2661.2
contemporary reality is happening is

2656.44 --> 2661.2000000000003
like so wildly different in ways

2662.14 --> 2668.92
and that's also part of the reason why

2665.68 --> 2672.5989999999997
I talk about that about what I was going

2668.92 --> 2672.599
through in the past what that was like

2672.819 --> 2676.92
because back then nobody knew

2680.079 --> 2685.3
but I kind of like need to I needed to

2683.02 --> 2688.359
actually share it but I just couldn't

2685.3 --> 2690.599
now I can and I'm trying to like fulfill

2688.359 --> 2690.5989999999997
it

2691.599 --> 2695.94
put it to rest that way anyway

2703.42 --> 2707.64
ride metal select Masters yeah

2712.06 --> 2716.98
but look the point is is that my show

2714.579 --> 2718.8390000000004
has always been like mostly very serious

2716.98 --> 2720.7
you guys know that right and then

2718.839 --> 2722.56
there's maybe a couple of giggly moments

2720.7 --> 2726.5789999999997
that just happen

2722.56 --> 2728.68
but I'm like kind of a hard ass

2726.579 --> 2731.92
a lot of the times

2728.68 --> 2733.66
and I do it for well sounds weird

2731.92 --> 2736.359
educational function because I really

2733.66 --> 2739.319
believe that it helps focus it helps

2736.359 --> 2739.319
sharpen you up

2740.079 --> 2745.0600000000004
it prevents demons from slipping in now

2742.9 --> 2748.14
even though they'll within some occasion

2745.06 --> 2748.14
might even try harder

2751.78 --> 2757.1800000000003
right

2753.7 --> 2759.7
because negligence not taking things

2757.18 --> 2762.7
serious is really problematic just

2759.7 --> 2765.839
letting people let themselves go without

2762.7 --> 2765.839
addressing them

2766.18 --> 2773.319
about it or anything right that's bad

2768.22 --> 2773.319
and everybody just loses becomes

2774.46 --> 2779.38
just seeking entertainment and not

2777.94 --> 2781.7200000000003
really learning anything not really

2779.38 --> 2783.94
caring so that's part of the reason why

2781.72 --> 2785.0789999999997
I've done that but yeah it does become a

2783.94 --> 2788.38
bit

2785.079 --> 2790.2400000000002
like cold in here sometimes and then the

2788.38 --> 2792.1600000000003
trolls come rolling and they're like oh

2790.24 --> 2794.14
yeah you did do this you did just do

2792.16 --> 2795.94
that

2794.14 --> 2798.9
and the annoying thing is that yeah

2795.94 --> 2798.9
they're not helping

2799.72 --> 2805.7999999999997
but partially they are sometimes a bit

2803.56 --> 2805.7999999999997
right

2807.76 --> 2812.619
so I mean yeah

2810.94 --> 2815.079
if I'm going to be doing a lot better

2812.619 --> 2818.2000000000003
then maybe I can also attempt to just

2815.079 --> 2822.42
get more fun into it

2818.2 --> 2822.4199999999996
and I'll still be strict

2822.46 --> 2827.56
but maybe less of a hard ass about it

2824.8 --> 2831.0
now know that I'll still be hard ass but

2827.56 --> 2831.0
just more eloquently

2831.579 --> 2836.26
with less

2833.619 --> 2839.1400000000003
aggression

2836.26 --> 2842.1600000000003
less frustration from my side leaking

2839.14 --> 2842.16
through when I do it

2850.14 --> 2857.6189999999997
no of course but in the interactions I

2854.56 --> 2859.72
mean right I'm not talking even about

2857.619 --> 2862.2400000000002
when I go raging or anything that's a

2859.72 --> 2863.859
whole different story but yeah you guys

2862.24 --> 2866.7999999999997
of course know that I'm not really

2863.859 --> 2868.66
addressing the general public when I do

2866.8 --> 2871.42
that

2868.66 --> 2875.22
and well I'm not talking about the

2871.42 --> 2875.2200000000003
general public yeah never mind

2876.099 --> 2878.579
right

2879.88 --> 2884.56
but anyway I thought that it was a

2882.16 --> 2886.1189999999997
really funny joke

2884.56 --> 2888.88
right

2886.119 --> 2891.4
Jim Bob has joined the hermeneutical

2888.88 --> 2894.2200000000003
industry

2891.4 --> 2895.78
and is doing gain of function research

2894.22 --> 2896.9199999999996
on scripture

2895.78 --> 2899.52
I mean

2896.92 --> 2899.52
come on

2905.339 --> 2911.7999999999997
because that's what it is isn't it

2908.64 --> 2914.7999999999997
except instead of being virus

2911.8 --> 2918.4
it's the scripture they're taking the

2914.8 --> 2920.2000000000003
scripture and they're improving it

2918.4 --> 2923.2000000000003
it's like a gain of function I mean

2920.2 --> 2925.359
hermeneutical

2923.2 --> 2927.7
sounds very much like pharmaceutical

2925.359 --> 2931.06
doesn't it come on do I have to explain

2927.7 --> 2933.8799999999997
it for [ __ ] sake you have to really

2931.06 --> 2936.54
explain it before you guys

2933.88 --> 2936.54
get it

2937.54 --> 2942.64
didn't seem to have that trouble over it

2939.46 --> 2944.26
over and Benjamin's uh comment section

2942.64 --> 2948.72
in bitu

2944.26 --> 2948.7200000000003
got a lot of upvotes for it actually

2952.359 --> 2955.96
hmm

2953.5 --> 2959.76
hey guns have never owned Roberts good

2955.96 --> 2959.76
to see you man PayPal oh

2959.8 --> 2966.1800000000003
so

2962.14 --> 2966.18
it just keeps getting better and better

2972.94 --> 2975.54
thanks

2981.099 --> 2983.76
huh

2984.339 --> 2990.9
dude I should have taken ashwagana

2987.76 --> 2990.9
right during Christmas

2991.96 --> 2996.839
although I did have to like go through

2994.06 --> 2996.839
something I guess

3000.54 --> 3003.9
but yeah thank you so much for the

3002.339 --> 3006.74
support guns and everyone I really

3003.9 --> 3006.7400000000002
appreciate that

3009.54 --> 3014.88
wow if this keeps going guys then I

3012.359 --> 3018.2999999999997
might actually at some point be able to

3014.88 --> 3021.619
get rid of some of the debt again but I

3018.3 --> 3021.619
mean thank you I

3021.72 --> 3028.319
you guys forget sometimes perhaps

3025.04 --> 3030.66
that like for me it's not some kind of

3028.319 --> 3032.7599999999998
universal look we need support

3030.66 --> 3034.92
to keep the organization now for me it's

3032.76 --> 3036.0
literally like that's the money I used

3034.92 --> 3040.2000000000003
to

3036.0 --> 3042.96
get food and get smokes

3040.2 --> 3045.18
because pretty much everything else is

3042.96 --> 3047.54
mostly just going out on things like

3045.18 --> 3047.54
rent

3050.3 --> 3055.92
it's everything's become yeah anyway you

3054.3 --> 3057.3
guys know thank you so much for the

3055.92 --> 3061.6800000000003
support I mean

3057.3 --> 3064.559
yeah if I get regular support like this

3061.68 --> 3067.859
then I can make it as as has happened

3064.559 --> 3070.3190000000004
before it I don't know this

3067.859 --> 3074.66
it was just some massive Financial

3070.319 --> 3074.66
blowback everywhere in the world I think

3075.0 --> 3078.38
around last December

3083.72 --> 3088.9199999999996
in a way to me it's really felt like the

3086.88 --> 3091.5
entire world like I was gonna die and

3088.92 --> 3093.6800000000003
I'm not blaming you guys just for the

3091.5 --> 3093.68
record

3094.859 --> 3099.66
I never blamed you guys I always blame

3097.2 --> 3102.0589999999997
myself because I felt like am I just not

3099.66 --> 3105.14
worth it anymore at times yeah I'm such

3102.059 --> 3105.1400000000003
a drama queen I know

3106.579 --> 3111.059
what I really appreciate it man I really

3109.38 --> 3113.1600000000003
do this

3111.059 --> 3116.9
thank you so much

3113.16 --> 3116.8999999999996
especially after kind of like

3117.359 --> 3120.319
the uh

3121.8 --> 3127.4
the friction we had

3123.96 --> 3127.4
I really appreciate it

3128.64 --> 3134.4
thank you yeah I do well yeah I do put a

3131.46 --> 3136.859
lot of effort now a lot of effort Maybe

3134.4 --> 3139.75
I take my show very serious

3136.859 --> 3142.929
and I take what I do on it very serious

3139.75 --> 3142.929
[Music]

3144.42 --> 3148.76
what again

3146.16 --> 3148.7599999999998
are you kidding me

3149.819 --> 3154.859
wow

3152.46 --> 3158.059
you're gonna make me blush man

3154.859 --> 3158.0589999999997
thank you so much

3166.38 --> 3169.339
that is awesome

3175.8 --> 3180.079
all right

3177.72 --> 3182.64
thank you

3180.079 --> 3186.059
because I'd been like lending of

3182.64 --> 3188.339
everything like I even my dad usually

3186.059 --> 3191.1600000000003
doesn't even do that when I I can lend

3188.339 --> 3194.04
sometimes from my dad

3191.16 --> 3195.42
quickly like if I get a PayPal in

3194.04 --> 3197.7599999999998
from somebody

3195.42 --> 3199.559
then I can like ask my dad can I please

3197.76 --> 3201.1800000000003
borrow something because he can transfer

3199.559 --> 3204.3590000000004
it to me and it'll be there immediately

3201.18 --> 3207.18
like within one minute

3204.359 --> 3209.2799999999997
and then when I get the PayPal in then I

3207.18 --> 3212.339
pay it back to him so we've had kind of

3209.28 --> 3214.5
that Arrangement very awesome and I'm so

3212.339 --> 3216.599
happy that he does it and it gives me an

3214.5 --> 3219.619
excuse to basically talk to him more

3216.599 --> 3219.619
regularly also

3221.099 --> 3225.48
because I don't typically just call him

3223.559 --> 3227.4
unless there's some really relevant

3225.48 --> 3229.68
conversation that I think he knows

3227.4 --> 3231.42
something about right that I could bring

3229.68 --> 3235.0789999999997
up

3231.42 --> 3237.78
but yeah I had to actually borrow like a

3235.079 --> 3239.7000000000003
week ago from him because

3237.78 --> 3241.2000000000003
and I couldn't pay it back I said like

3239.7 --> 3244.68
yeah I can only pay it back when I get

3241.2 --> 3247.6189999999997
my my money in because it's just I I but

3244.68 --> 3249.96
I need to eat something help and he did

3247.619 --> 3252.359
that normally he doesn't do that and

3249.96 --> 3255.18
it's like man this is

3252.359 --> 3257.94
and just getting more paypals now recent

3255.18 --> 3261.0589999999997
few days and especially you gonna snap

3257.94 --> 3263.9
around like I can actually

3261.059 --> 3263.9
fix it

3265.68 --> 3271.0789999999997
never give up never surrender

3268.8 --> 3274.04
thank you Jason Brown I appreciate that

3271.079 --> 3274.04
and I agree

3274.14 --> 3279.54
and I will never give up but I never

3277.02 --> 3282.079
surrender but still I mean it can get

3279.54 --> 3282.079
really

3282.3 --> 3286.88
kind of like lonely and desperate in

3284.52 --> 3286.88
ways

3288.3 --> 3293.94
and I can't really actually just vent

3291.359 --> 3296.52
that off on you guys

3293.94 --> 3298.079
like that's inappropriate and that's bad

3296.52 --> 3299.04
behavior that's not the way to deal with

3298.079 --> 3301.38
it

3299.04 --> 3305.04
so then I'm kind yeah it's like

3301.38 --> 3307.319
because when I feel really bad

3305.04 --> 3310.14
sounds weird but in to a certain degree

3307.319 --> 3314.16
I have to uphold a certain image like I

3310.14 --> 3316.14
can't just be completely like crying on

3314.16 --> 3320.3999999999996
camera and [ __ ] because sometimes I

3316.14 --> 3322.319
really do feel desperate enough to cry

3320.4 --> 3325.4
but I'm not gonna do that because I

3322.319 --> 3327.599
don't want to be a [ __ ]

3325.4 --> 3330.26
it's just

3327.599 --> 3330.26
right

3333.48 --> 3337.619
there's enough of that already out there

3335.4 --> 3340.92
and people

3337.619 --> 3343.619
you guys are not coming here to see that

3340.92 --> 3344.88
we're here to see genuine

3343.619 --> 3347.6400000000003
truth

3344.88 --> 3349.859
from the heart and strength right if

3347.64 --> 3353.7599999999998
there's something miserable

3349.859 --> 3356.22
strength there's no desperation with no

3353.76 --> 3358.559
nothing to fix it that that doesn't come

3356.22 --> 3360.8999999999996
from me

3358.559 --> 3363.8
have you ever seen the movie Inside Out

3360.9 --> 3363.8
I might have

3364.44 --> 3370.2200000000003
could be I don't remember though what it

3367.2 --> 3370.22
was about then

3379.52 --> 3385.14
right

3381.18 --> 3387.24
anyway this is a real turnaround

3385.14 --> 3390.18
I hope it's gonna kind of stay I hope

3387.24 --> 3392.7799999999997
you guys are gonna also be doing great

3390.18 --> 3392.7799999999997
right

3393.18 --> 3398.819
because

3394.5 --> 3402.48
in my mind again I sorry it's an

3398.819 --> 3404.579
accident I do it by mistake I think that

3402.48 --> 3406.4
I don't get support because I'm doing

3404.579 --> 3408.9
bad

3406.4 --> 3410.579
even though I say it like but I'm doing

3408.9 --> 3412.6800000000003
great I can prove that I'm doing great

3410.579 --> 3414.42
but still it's like it almost starts

3412.68 --> 3416.7
feeling like when I do that then that

3414.42 --> 3420.119
I'm actually lying

3416.7 --> 3423.24
even though it isn't a lie that's how

3420.119 --> 3424.98
bad it can get sometimes

3423.24 --> 3426.839
it's like

3424.98 --> 3428.7
when you're feeling that bad then the

3426.839 --> 3431.7599999999998
reality just is like yeah it doesn't

3428.7 --> 3434.0989999999997
matter if it's real it's it's not real

3431.76 --> 3436.1400000000003
because it you have such an overwhelming

3434.099 --> 3438.119
impression of something that contradicts

3436.14 --> 3440.94
that

3438.119 --> 3443.28
and it's making it about me but it isn't

3440.94 --> 3445.619
about me because it's about you guys and

3443.28 --> 3450.619
you guys had a lot of financial turmoil

3445.619 --> 3450.619
everybody in the world has not just me

3452.52 --> 3458.579
but because of my

3454.98 --> 3460.5
construction of this show and yeah the

3458.579 --> 3461.63
need of your help I've been kind of

3460.5 --> 3464.04
double [ __ ]

3461.63 --> 3467.94
[Music]

3464.04 --> 3471.119
but it's not because I suck and it's not

3467.94 --> 3475.7000000000003
because you suck it's because of

3471.119 --> 3475.7000000000003
how I have chosen to do this

3475.859 --> 3480.2999999999997
this setup

3478.319 --> 3482.7599999999998
and so I should have

3480.3 --> 3484.8
yeah and I tried to do it mostly be

3482.76 --> 3488.579
eloquent about it and just like sit okay

3484.8 --> 3490.7400000000002
I just have to have a period of hunger

3488.579 --> 3493.02
but I just get really desperate it's

3490.74 --> 3495.72
like please please give me some water

3493.02 --> 3497.579
please I'm so thirsty please

3495.72 --> 3500.48
it does get like that something you

3497.579 --> 3500.48
could have heard that

3502.14 --> 3506.7
that did Shine through a bit

3504.839 --> 3509.46
but I always try to minimize it because

3506.7 --> 3510.7799999999997
it gets on people's nerves I mean when

3509.46 --> 3512.52
they want the help and they can't help

3510.78 --> 3515.3
it gets on your nerves and I'm really

3512.52 --> 3515.3
sorry about that

3518.819 --> 3525.74
but I'm doing better now

3521.16 --> 3525.74
and hopefully you guys are too

3526.2 --> 3531.02
I am

3527.339 --> 3531.02
Fleet today what does that mean

3533.16 --> 3535.7599999999998
what

3535.859 --> 3542.0989999999997
guns bro

3539.099 --> 3544.92
I mean don't don't spend any money you

3542.099 --> 3548.28
can't afford to lose dude

3544.92 --> 3550.26
I I really appreciate it though

3548.28 --> 3552.92
I mean God

ah

3589.799 --> 3596.66
you can afford it this good

3592.68 --> 3596.66
by the way how's the back situation

3601.319 --> 3606.119
because you had some issues like you had

3603.78 --> 3607.8590000000004
the surgery again right

3606.119 --> 3611.099
was that you or was that somebody else

3607.859 --> 3613.5589999999997
might be mixing it up crap

3611.099 --> 3615.7200000000003
there's multiple people with back

3613.559 --> 3617.2200000000003
problems

3615.72 --> 3621.3799999999997
what's that you

3617.22 --> 3621.3799999999997
sorry if I'm mixing you up

3621.48 --> 3628.079
what's the Julio pattern or something

3625.02 --> 3630.92
has anybody seen Julio paben recently I

3628.079 --> 3630.92
haven't seen him in a while

3630.96 --> 3636.9
I hope he's all right

3634.14 --> 3638.8799999999997
50 yeah so you did you did have like the

3636.9 --> 3642.14
back surgery right that was you

3638.88 --> 3642.1400000000003
50 50. okay

3656.9 --> 3661.1600000000003
there miss yes I know

3663.78 --> 3668.4
it's it's very scary to me

3666.9 --> 3671.2200000000003
really

3668.4 --> 3673.5
I'm very happy to not have any

3671.22 --> 3677.839
serious back problems like that and

3673.5 --> 3677.839
because I've seen what that can do

3679.68 --> 3686.22
because my mother had like fell really

3682.859 --> 3689.18
bad from a horse and she had like nerve

3686.22 --> 3689.18
damage because of that

3690.0 --> 3694.76
and the operation like didn't help

3698.22 --> 3704.4599999999996
so she had like basically a bad hernia

3701.579 --> 3708.119
that anyway I don't want to get into all

3704.46 --> 3712.04
that it was bad so I'm like I know and I

3708.119 --> 3712.04
I'm an empath it's my mother

3712.079 --> 3716.94
so at times I could like feel her pain I

3714.48 --> 3721.68
had to actually like kind of like Cut

3716.94 --> 3724.339
Her Off in a way in a more physical way

3721.68 --> 3724.339
because

3724.559 --> 3729.0
I would start to feel

3726.72 --> 3732.0789999999997
like what that pain was doing to her

3729.0 --> 3732.079
it's really horrific

3736.559 --> 3741.9
I wonder sometimes if if that also even

3739.38 --> 3744.6600000000003
more contributed to her just

3741.9 --> 3747.839
lose your mind

3744.66 --> 3749.64
because before that there between my

3747.839 --> 3750.839
mother and my dad it was already a bit

3749.64 --> 3753.54
rough

3750.839 --> 3756.9
but a bit I mean never like physical

3753.54 --> 3760.5
abuse or anything like constant whining

3756.9 --> 3763.559
and bickering never-ending bickering

3760.5 --> 3765.48
and like but still some attempts of

3763.559 --> 3768.6600000000003
making up and having good times again

3765.48 --> 3771.66
but it was still kind of rough

3768.66 --> 3775.16
it was a challenge for me also but then

3771.66 --> 3775.16
when that happened it's like

3776.76 --> 3779.88
like things really started and she

3778.559 --> 3781.6800000000003
became worse

3779.88 --> 3783.48
and she became more pharmaceutical

3781.68 --> 3785.94
dependent

3783.48 --> 3788.64
and and then depression and all kinds of

3785.94 --> 3790.14
things and and my dad was like yeah this

3788.64 --> 3793.3799999999997
is

3790.14 --> 3795.5989999999997
you're not the person I I once knew

3793.38 --> 3799.1400000000003
you're crazy

3795.599 --> 3800.28
and you you won't stop bullying me

3799.14 --> 3802.859
like

3800.28 --> 3805.88
and then she really snapped sorry sorry

3802.859 --> 3805.88
to bring all that up

3811.5 --> 3818.54
so in the past anyway

3814.319 --> 3818.54
but yeah back problems suck

3818.76 --> 3821.8190000000004
so I'm really kind of rooting for you

3820.68 --> 3824.7
that dude

3821.819 --> 3826.02
get it that you restore

3824.7 --> 3828.8999999999996
I mean

3826.02 --> 3832.799
is it like is the problem that like the

3828.9 --> 3835.5
the operations can't really fix it or is

3832.799 --> 3838.02
it rather that your regeneration of the

3835.5 --> 3839.7
whole thing is getting problems

3838.02 --> 3842.46
because like every time an operation

3839.7 --> 3844.5
happened like it all has to regenerate

3842.46 --> 3847.7400000000002
again around it right if you're having

3844.5 --> 3850.799
problems with that that really sucks

3847.74 --> 3853.319
but it could also be that just like the

3850.799 --> 3855.0
operations that just don't really work

3853.319 --> 3858.68
as effectively

3855.0 --> 3858.68
I can't really fix the issue

3860.339 --> 3863.24
which one is it

3863.64 --> 3867.5
okay

3864.66 --> 3867.5
card yeah

3869.66 --> 3876.6189999999997
slowly deteriorating [ __ ]

3873.48 --> 3876.619
that sucks man

3878.88 --> 3881.299
right

3881.4 --> 3885.78
I wonder though if you could still isn't

3883.74 --> 3889.22
there like a way to kind of like boost

3885.78 --> 3889.2200000000003
your physical system

3890.16 --> 3894.42
thank you

3892.02 --> 3896.7
like how are your testosterone levels

3894.42 --> 3899.16
for example testosterone is really good

3896.7 --> 3902.18
for well overall mentally function but

3899.16 --> 3902.18
also regeneration

3910.2 --> 3916.02
right if if the Regeneration of it

3913.98 --> 3917.41
becomes an issue and it's you say slowly

3916.02 --> 3919.44
deteriorating

3917.41 --> 3922.2
[Music]

3919.44 --> 3924.859
almost paralyzed a lot better good

3922.2 --> 3924.859
right

3929.28 --> 3934.46
now don't worry about the Caps dude

3931.31 --> 3934.46
[Music]

3937.559 --> 3943.1400000000003
right but I mean

3941.46 --> 3944.94
you might be able to push the

3943.14 --> 3947.64
Regeneration just a little bit further

3944.94 --> 3948.9
and and basically getting an even better

3947.64 --> 3951.0
condition

3948.9 --> 3953.46
Beyond just not being paralyzed anymore

3951.0 --> 3955.64
which I'm very happy that you're out of

3953.46 --> 3955.64
that

3956.94 --> 3959.119
thank you

3962.04 --> 3968.7599999999998
so like check it check your testosterone

3965.16 --> 3972.359
levels if they're really low then that's

3968.76 --> 3975.7200000000003
also going to be in my opinion part of

3972.359 --> 3977.88
the reason why regeneration is

3975.72 --> 3979.799
not great

3977.88 --> 3982.1600000000003
because it really helps your entire

3979.799 --> 3982.16
system

3982.94 --> 3988.76
like when you have good testosterone

3985.319 --> 3988.7599999999998
your wounds heal faster

3988.859 --> 3993.7799999999997
yes you do

3991.799 --> 3996.599
what what do you mean

3993.78 --> 3999.2000000000003
so you have good testosterone levels is

3996.599 --> 3999.2000000000003
that what you mean

4008.78 --> 4011.9
is anybody still out there by the way

4010.88 --> 4014.42
and

4011.9 --> 4016.9
having this conversation with guns are

4014.42 --> 4016.9
never own

4019.76 --> 4027.4
Jason Brown is still there LSG metal

4022.76 --> 4027.4
slugs jedo seeking star water

4027.74 --> 4033.7
zept happy flatter that flat fellow are

4031.16 --> 4033.7
you still there

4036.74 --> 4043.66
rear past halfway the show

4039.98 --> 4043.66
don't forget to rogans it up

4051.619 --> 4057.38
okay

4054.079 --> 4061.7000000000003
okay the healthy but I mean that's kind

4057.38 --> 4063.859
of over General that's very generalized

4061.7 --> 4066.9399999999996
that's why I'm asking specifically the

4063.859 --> 4066.94
testosterone levels

4067.22 --> 4073.1189999999997
right because overall when you age they

4070.46 --> 4073.119
drop I mean

4073.4 --> 4078.799
but that also gets in the way of well

4077.059 --> 4082.9
your regeneration ability and there's

4078.799 --> 4082.9
things you can do to help that

4083.119 --> 4087.46
okay

4085.039 --> 4087.46
okay

4093.5 --> 4098.179
right

4094.94 --> 4100.58
okay I'm just saying I'm just saying

4098.179 --> 4102.62
your doctor like to read your blood and

4100.58 --> 4104.6
just to see if something is going wrong

4102.62 --> 4107.7789999999995
right because of the operations and all

4104.6 --> 4109.279
that might something unexpected happen

4107.779 --> 4111.02
or whatever

4109.279 --> 4113.4800000000005
but

4111.02 --> 4116.299000000001
you might want to look into

4113.48 --> 4119.12
like taking it a step further and

4116.299 --> 4123.319
discuss it discuss with the doctor

4119.12 --> 4126.0199999999995
whatever like hey maybe you could

4123.319 --> 4128.4800000000005
like increase testosterone levels and

4126.02 --> 4130.279
that would help the Regeneration what

4128.48 --> 4131.718999999999
does he think about that maybe it might

4130.279 --> 4133.759
be too risky or something right

4131.719 --> 4136.42
definitely consult your doctor if you're

4133.759 --> 4136.42
gonna try that

4136.46 --> 4140.719
but

4137.779 --> 4143.540000000001
he might not even be

4140.719 --> 4147.1
like considering that as an option

4143.54 --> 4147.1
before you tell him

4147.98 --> 4154.699
or maybe he's just not into that

4151.88 --> 4157.16
and you have to seek like out like so

4154.699 --> 4159.8589999999995
like a more a body Health person that

4157.16 --> 4162.8189999999995
know a lot more about it

4159.859 --> 4162.819
I'm not a doctor

4163.219 --> 4167.179
but I would consider it you might be

4165.14 --> 4168.7390000000005
able to get a little bit more out of

4167.179 --> 4171.02
your situation

4168.739 --> 4173.299
and not just feel like oh I'm just

4171.02 --> 4175.540000000001
slowly dying or something because that

4173.299 --> 4175.54
sucks

4180.14 --> 4185.38
hello by the way Nature Boy

4182.48 --> 4185.379999999999
good to see you again

4191.839 --> 4197.8
right so you will talk yeah think about

4194.6 --> 4197.8
it just think about it

4202.58 --> 4207.26
right

4203.96 --> 4209.3
there's no harm in just

4207.26 --> 4212.92
checking like

4209.3 --> 4212.92
is that an option could that work

4215.179 --> 4222.6990000000005
below the studio 68 good to see you man

4218.199 --> 4222.699
24 watching huh not bad

4224.6 --> 4227.92
getting hungry by the way

4232.18 --> 4235.64
[Music]

4234.08 --> 4237.08
it's been brewing in your mind already

4235.64 --> 4239.320000000001
okay cool

4237.08 --> 4239.32
foreign

4253.48 --> 4257.62
debate yesterday was a blast

4258.02 --> 4265.06
I think I was actually out for groceries

4260.78 --> 4265.0599999999995
most of it but it started out pretty fun

4266.96 --> 4272.62
and you have to show went on for like 45

4269.179 --> 4274.76
minutes I think

4272.62 --> 4277.159
was it longer

4274.76 --> 4278.900000000001
but not super long which was very

4277.159 --> 4282.82
surprising because we were all very

4278.9 --> 4282.82
energetic during the entire after show

4291.219 --> 4296.06
and like the guys stuck her like Adam

4293.96 --> 4298.76
meekin and Brian stuck around chatting

4296.06 --> 4300.860000000001
like man past

4298.76 --> 4302.900000000001
for many more hours let's just say it

4300.86 --> 4305.239
like that like three hours or four hours

4302.9 --> 4306.5
or something but I eventually just

4305.239 --> 4308.36
dropped off because they were getting

4306.5 --> 4312.26
technical about

4308.36 --> 4315.739
football I'm like okay yeah now I'm up

4312.26 --> 4318.37
because I don't give a [ __ ] about like

4315.739 --> 4321.419999999999
the Super Bowl

4318.37 --> 4321.42
[Music]

4330.08 --> 4333.98
I mean if they're talking about soccer

4332.0 --> 4336.739
or you know some International thing

4333.98 --> 4338.0
idea like okay honestly I'll still

4336.739 --> 4341.0599999999995
listen

4338.0 --> 4342.94
but any other thing that's sport related

4341.06 --> 4346.46
I'm like

4342.94 --> 4348.5599999999995
uh that's all technical Bible to me

4346.46 --> 4349.82
I don't know any of the names I don't

4348.56 --> 4350.84
know anything about what you're

4349.82 --> 4353.299999999999
discussing

4350.84 --> 4355.28
[Music]

4353.3 --> 4359.08
sounds

4355.28 --> 4359.08
he's sitting on a horse what

4362.9 --> 4364.96
what

4367.6 --> 4372.8
else what a really good

4370.88 --> 4376.06
yes what

4372.8 --> 4376.06
why do you say that

4376.58 --> 4381.14
I don't think he really has Alzheimer's

4379.64 --> 4384.26
he's just

4381.14 --> 4387.219
getting caught up in things and then he

4384.26 --> 4387.219
loses track a bit

4388.36 --> 4396.199
Johnson Oh you mean Quantum eraser

4392.659 --> 4398.12
yeah he has a real cowboy act going it's

4396.199 --> 4400.04
his thing

4398.12 --> 4403.099999999999
it's kind of funny because I think he's

4400.04 --> 4406.96
actually a nerd so it's his act

4403.1 --> 4406.96
he's probably like that always

4418.58 --> 4423.38
right but guns look I don't think tenth

4421.46 --> 4426.199
man has Alzheimer's that's ridiculous

4423.38 --> 4429.62
he's like eating too healthy for that

4426.199 --> 4431.36
and he's keeping himself very busy you

4429.62 --> 4433.94
don't really get Alzheimer's that way

4431.36 --> 4436.42
typically

4433.94 --> 4436.419999999999
right

4437.6 --> 4443.54
and he is he has strength his strength

4441.14 --> 4446.3
of deed in his mind so the Alzheimer's

4443.54 --> 4448.64
not typically going to set in

4446.3 --> 4451.76
think I I don't see it

4448.64 --> 4453.62
he just has good moments and bad moments

4451.76 --> 4457.2390000000005
and when he has bad moments he does get

4453.62 --> 4457.239
a bit flustered but I mean

4457.52 --> 4461.5
that happens to a lot of people

4462.02 --> 4465.280000000001
even when they're younger

4469.699 --> 4472.659
so I don't know

4475.28 --> 4480.639999999999
well what Robert what makes you think

4478.4 --> 4480.639999999999
that

4482.3 --> 4486.52
what makes you think that he has that

4512.659 --> 4519.4
just kidding okay

4516.56 --> 4519.400000000001
it's uh

4519.98 --> 4526.54
a bit of a weird joke but okay

4523.58 --> 4526.54
this is

4527.08 --> 4535.219
yeah and I mean dude when he's bad yeah

4532.52 --> 4537.38
it is almost like he's just demented all

4535.219 --> 4540.92
the gits right

4537.38 --> 4544.58
but he has very clear moments and he is

4540.92 --> 4548.06
very clear then in like

4544.58 --> 4549.8
I mean I can be a bit demented myself at

4548.06 --> 4551.659000000001
times when I'm doing not so great

4549.8 --> 4553.58
especially when just a lot of bad

4551.659 --> 4554.54
feelings getting in the way

4553.58 --> 4556.699
right

4554.54 --> 4560.98
doesn't make me demented it just makes

4556.699 --> 4560.98
me lower functional in that moment

4570.8 --> 4576.14
not lots of stuff 10 things less yes

4573.14 --> 4578.2390000000005
absolutely me too I mean he's deaf man

4576.14 --> 4581.0
has helped me understand it a lot better

4578.239 --> 4584.36
because Celestial navigation has always

4581.0 --> 4585.14
been very difficult to picture in my

4584.36 --> 4587.54
mind

4585.14 --> 4589.1
I still remember like when I was 12 or

4587.54 --> 4590.48
something my parents tried to teach me

4589.1 --> 4593.84
about it

4590.48 --> 4597.62
and I got that there were patterns

4593.84 --> 4599.3
I just couldn't fit them in my head that

4597.62 --> 4602.54
was the issue with Celestia I was just

4599.3 --> 4604.64
like I don't really understand it I see

4602.54 --> 4607.34
that there's this thing but I just don't

4604.64 --> 4609.400000000001
I can't picture it I I don't understand

4607.34 --> 4611.84
it really

4609.4 --> 4613.159
even if you tell me like oh this is how

4611.84 --> 4614.4800000000005
you do it that's how you do it it's like

4613.159 --> 4617.659
I don't get it

4614.48 --> 4619.879999999999
I don't understand what this o actually

4617.659 --> 4621.679
means so

4619.88 --> 4624.5
dance man getting on the scene and

4621.679 --> 4627.679
talking about it over and over and over

4624.5 --> 4629.659
again has actually really helped me to

4627.679 --> 4633.52
just clear that up more because it's

4629.659 --> 4633.5199999999995
been really difficult to get in my head

4635.179 --> 4639.7390000000005
now it helps of course that now

4637.88 --> 4643.34
I am

4639.739 --> 4646.639999999999
much more in detail aware

4643.34 --> 4649.52
about how the Earth is flat

4646.64 --> 4650.900000000001
and that makes it easier to actually get

4649.52 --> 4653.84
to understand it

4650.9 --> 4657.739
than when I was younger and I got to

4653.84 --> 4659.78
hear it but it was not connected it was

4657.739 --> 4661.879999999999
just like a split reality to me it's

4659.78 --> 4663.5
like oh yeah this is the Flat Earth

4661.88 --> 4665.06
mechanics or something with certain

4663.5 --> 4667.34
things

4665.06 --> 4670.76
and here's the globe world

4667.34 --> 4674.12
and I just didn't really know which one

4670.76 --> 4677.6
was actually real even though

4674.12 --> 4680.42
there were some arguments from sides but

4677.6 --> 4683.38
I just couldn't make up my mind about it

4680.42 --> 4683.38
when that happened

4686.179 --> 4688.6
before

4690.08 --> 4694.5199999999995
that's one yeah that's what it was like

4691.94 --> 4697.0599999999995
when it was like real like early teens

4694.52 --> 4697.06
and all that

4697.46 --> 4702.02
and then later I kind of forgot about

4699.5 --> 4703.88
that literally forgetting about like

4702.02 --> 4705.679
just losing track of it because I'm not

4703.88 --> 4708.32
exposed to it nobody was talking about

4705.679 --> 4710.36
it around me but everything was talking

4708.32 --> 4711.98
about the globe and so then got caught

4710.36 --> 4716.199
up in that again through

4711.98 --> 4716.199
that in that school time

4716.239 --> 4721.759999999999
post Waldorf School in the other type of

4719.48 --> 4724.699
school which was much more of a Jesuit

4721.76 --> 4727.52
type school really

4724.699 --> 4729.44
although it wasn't like there were some

4727.52 --> 4732.820000000001
there Jesuits

4729.44 --> 4732.82
like but whatever

4734.12 --> 4739.46
there I became actually that's where the

4736.76 --> 4741.1990000000005
ball win was Unchained basically

4739.46 --> 4743.54
and I kind of forgot about the Flat

4741.199 --> 4745.219
Earth things that I learned that were

4743.54 --> 4747.8
still compartmentalized that still was

4745.219 --> 4749.84
never able to choose properly and then I

4747.8 --> 4751.88
kind of just rolled into believing in

4749.84 --> 4754.6
the globe fully and kind of forgetting

4751.88 --> 4754.6
about the Flat Earth

4756.44 --> 4760.94
people were just getting triggered

4758.48 --> 4763.58
anyway about it when I was trying to

4760.94 --> 4766.099999999999
talk about it much younger

4763.58 --> 4768.08
and that would really scare me off of

4766.1 --> 4769.58
talking about it because I did not want

4768.08 --> 4770.9
people to

4769.58 --> 4773.0599999999995
hate me

4770.9 --> 4776.199
and go after me

4773.06 --> 4776.1990000000005
because I upset them

4776.3 --> 4781.78
unless it's some kind of dominance thing

4778.4 --> 4781.78
and that's another process

4782.44 --> 4787.419999999999
pecking order all that but anyway

4788.84 --> 4794.78
now

4791.06 --> 4797.6
what is it 30 years later

4794.78 --> 4800.96
now I know the Earth is flat it's been

4797.6 --> 4802.64
broken like the the argumentations that

4800.96 --> 4805.34
I even got the hair between the globe

4802.64 --> 4808.159000000001
and the Flat Earth much younger

4805.34 --> 4809.719
I couldn't I couldn't grasp them it's

4808.159 --> 4812.12
like okay there's some there's things

4809.719 --> 4815.0
happening this is I could read the

4812.12 --> 4816.5599999999995
feelings about it but I couldn't really

4815.0 --> 4818.3
understand

4816.56 --> 4820.159000000001
it

4818.3 --> 4822.56
that there were real arguments I

4820.159 --> 4824.0599999999995
couldn't grasp it I could see what was

4822.56 --> 4825.38
happening could see the pattern but I

4824.06 --> 4827.860000000001
couldn't grasp what they'd actually

4825.38 --> 4827.86
meant

4828.56 --> 4835.159000000001
but then much much later

4832.179 --> 4838.1
2015 when I was 35

4835.159 --> 4840.199
roughly 12 20 years later you could say

4838.1 --> 4842.4800000000005
Flat Earth Awakening happened and that

4840.199 --> 4844.699
really that moment I had been kind of

4842.48 --> 4845.78
vacuous for a long time felt very

4844.699 --> 4849.4
abandoned

4845.78 --> 4849.4
I lost friends

4849.739 --> 4856.4
and I felt really [ __ ] up I lost my

4852.08 --> 4859.64
girlfriend I didn't yeah and then

4856.4 --> 4862.219
suddenly now the Flat Earth was on the

4859.64 --> 4863.96
scene welcoming like it's okay to talk

4862.219 --> 4866.78
about it and that's like the first time

4863.96 --> 4868.88
I've ever experienced that that was

4866.78 --> 4871.28
publicly just it's okay to talk about it

4868.88 --> 4874.1
now and people got really enthusiastic

4871.28 --> 4877.639999999999
and it's like finally

4874.1 --> 4879.5
finally I can just talk about it

4877.64 --> 4882.7390000000005
and it all came back to me all the

4879.5 --> 4884.6
things that I had learned and I then

4882.739 --> 4888.139999999999
proceeded to use that time of the

4884.6 --> 4890.360000000001
Awakening with letter 2015 to figure out

4888.14 --> 4892.04
what I had actually learned so to me it

4890.36 --> 4894.0199999999995
was like very nostalgic it's like all

4892.04 --> 4895.5199999999995
these old memories are suddenly coming

4894.02 --> 4898.219
back to me

4895.52 --> 4901.64
and then the freaking Visions got back

4898.219 --> 4906.14
to me of really dark [ __ ] too

4901.64 --> 4908.900000000001
and then that happened right basically

4906.14 --> 4910.42
but yeah that's pretty much the order of

4908.9 --> 4913.36
how

4910.42 --> 4916.58
it was all unfolded to me

4913.36 --> 4917.96
including my memories of like how I

4916.58 --> 4921.0199999999995
didn't understand it it's like

4917.96 --> 4923.659
understanding in so many layers you see

4921.02 --> 4926.540000000001
if you just understand what's happening

4923.659 --> 4929.299999999999
or understand like how the emotions are

4926.54 --> 4930.86
but in a certain scenario then you don't

4929.3 --> 4933.14
even have to understand the

4930.86 --> 4934.759999999999
argumentation you just

4933.14 --> 4936.92
understand that there is a certain

4934.76 --> 4938.900000000001
pattern a reoccurring thing

4936.92 --> 4941.4800000000005
that just happens

4938.9 --> 4942.62
and then you can learn how to deal with

4941.48 --> 4944.54
that

4942.62 --> 4948.14
but you don't ever have to actually

4944.54 --> 4951.0199999999995
understand the argumentation itself

4948.14 --> 4955.04
and that's how I went about a lot just

4951.02 --> 4956.42
purely pattern recognition

4955.04 --> 4959.84
it's

4956.42 --> 4961.52
in a way how I learned to socialize in

4959.84 --> 4963.8
general is through just pattern

4961.52 --> 4965.540000000001
recognition

4963.8 --> 4966.860000000001
like this is how people typically

4965.54 --> 4969.92
respond

4966.86 --> 4972.5
what does that mean to other people when

4969.92 --> 4975.32
people typically respond like this and

4972.5 --> 4976.34
what does it do to them is that a good

4975.32 --> 4978.32
thing

4976.34 --> 4980.3
is that the productive thing is that

4978.32 --> 4982.639999999999
constructive to the person and the world

4980.3 --> 4985.52
or is it not

4982.64 --> 4988.400000000001
and those kind of automated subconscious

4985.52 --> 4990.860000000001
processes went on continually as I tried

4988.4 --> 4992.659
to figure out how to socialize

4990.86 --> 4995.9
because I was never really a natural

4992.659 --> 4998.12
edit I was a natural at just being

4995.9 --> 5001.12
honest expressing what was inside of me

4998.12 --> 5002.98
if I could trust people with that and I

5001.12 --> 5006.28
I really when I was very young I only

5002.98 --> 5010.0199999999995
trust my parents and my brother

5006.28 --> 5010.0199999999995
but mostly to like my mother

5011.62 --> 5016.36
that the really deep honest things that

5014.14 --> 5017.58
I now by this time

5016.36 --> 5020.139999999999
foreign

5017.58 --> 5021.64
just kind of openly talking on the

5020.14 --> 5024.659000000001
internet about now

5021.64 --> 5024.659000000001
what a contrast

5031.78 --> 5034.32
anyway

5037.659 --> 5043.08
yeah but now with the Flat Earth

5040.38 --> 5045.58
understanding and and getting more

5043.08 --> 5048.28
exposure to all those argument

5045.58 --> 5050.5
mechanisms of mechanisms

5048.28 --> 5053.0199999999995
that I heard before but never understood

5050.5 --> 5056.08
only heard that there was a back and

5053.02 --> 5058.540000000001
forth and the feelings now I could

5056.08 --> 5061.3
certainly see it

5058.54 --> 5064.06
I can see the argumentation because I in

5061.3 --> 5067.4800000000005
The Awakening in 2015 and now I could

5064.06 --> 5069.88
learn it all and suddenly also Celestial

5067.48 --> 5072.159
navigation and the importance of it now

5069.88 --> 5074.1990000000005
for real in the actual argumentation

5072.159 --> 5077.62
started to shine through like I Now

5074.199 --> 5079.0599999999995
understand why it is so important for

5077.62 --> 5081.699
Flat Earth

5079.06 --> 5085.0
I just never really got it because I

5081.699 --> 5088.239
didn't understand any of it really

5085.0 --> 5090.34
it was all just like weird math and I

5088.239 --> 5092.199
just couldn't figure it in my head I

5090.34 --> 5094.96
just like why I don't know what is this

5092.199 --> 5097.12
like a star map is it as fair is it

5094.96 --> 5099.4
flattered like what is going on here

5097.12 --> 5101.08
that was my response when I was young I

5099.4 --> 5103.719
was very frustrated I wanted to get it

5101.08 --> 5106.12
but it just didn't

5103.719 --> 5108.76
and now

5106.12 --> 5111.94
truly understanding Flat Earth versus

5108.76 --> 5113.7390000000005
Globe now suddenly I am understanding

5111.94 --> 5115.719
Celestial navigation and all those

5113.739 --> 5117.639999999999
things a lot better and it really helps

5115.719 --> 5120.9
also that 10th man has been repeating

5117.64 --> 5120.900000000001
them over and over and over again

5121.42 --> 5123.96
foreign

5127.56 --> 5131.9800000000005
ologies and the typical math that

5130.719 --> 5134.86
accompanies it

5131.98 --> 5137.04
but I get how it works

5134.86 --> 5140.139999999999
I will always be able to know explain

5137.04 --> 5143.86
roughly without math

5140.14 --> 5146.679
roughly what it is I understand like the

5143.86 --> 5150.46
GP map I understand now that that flap

5146.679 --> 5154.2390000000005
star map isn't actually flat it's

5150.46 --> 5156.1
a sphere every time when something is

5154.239 --> 5157.178999999999
directly above that's what it actually

5156.1 --> 5159.52
is

5157.179 --> 5161.38
while it is on the Flat Earth and it's

5159.52 --> 5164.080000000001
coordinated like it's on a flat Earth

5161.38 --> 5167.62
and but those

5164.08 --> 5170.5599999999995
that description now I just did not

5167.62 --> 5172.3
understand that at all when I was 12. I

5170.56 --> 5174.34
couldn't understand that I couldn't

5172.3 --> 5176.5
explain it of course or you don't

5174.34 --> 5178.179
understand you how can you explain it I

5176.5 --> 5180.1
couldn't I couldn't

5178.179 --> 5182.82
now I can

5180.1 --> 5187.08
so it's taking me

5182.82 --> 5187.08
oh roughly 30 years

5189.639 --> 5193.8
oh well better late than ever right

5197.199 --> 5201.719
low blue pill Devolution good to see you

5199.54 --> 5201.719
man

5204.04 --> 5209.46
all right hope you all are appreciating

5206.08 --> 5209.46
the show today

5210.4 --> 5214.0199999999995
I don't know what I'm gonna call it

5211.78 --> 5214.0199999999995
though

5214.12 --> 5216.36
foreign

5216.51 --> 5219.579000000001
[Music]

5232.139 --> 5236.639
testosterone regeneration and

5237.04 --> 5240.96
Sextant understanding evolution

5244.179 --> 5247.96
foreign

5245.52 --> 5249.88
that's pretty much the subjects that's

5247.96 --> 5253.679
been talked about

5249.88 --> 5253.679
what's this ah

5256.54 --> 5259.139

5259.54 --> 5263.58
how do I do this for any video

5282.94 --> 5285.94
foreign

5291.699 --> 5298.08
it's a mouthful though

5294.82 --> 5298.08
it's all big words

5303.1 --> 5308.679
I got a good grip on reality for our

5305.139 --> 5310.9800000000005
most buff yeah I mean I could just say

5308.679 --> 5310.9800000000005
yeah

5311.38 --> 5317.02
because of the detail of it

5313.48 --> 5319.599999999999
but I mean there are people out there

5317.02 --> 5320.56
that probably have even a better grip on

5319.6 --> 5323.08
reality

5320.56 --> 5325.2390000000005
they just have more issues trying to

5323.08 --> 5327.84
actually explain it because that's where

5325.239 --> 5327.839999999999
I exceed

5328.26 --> 5334.96
right A lot of people understand reality

5331.48 --> 5337.0
really well it's just very difficult to

5334.96 --> 5339.639
explain because it's like an intuitive

5337.0 --> 5341.8
process for a lot of people

5339.639 --> 5344.82
where as soon as they try to explain it

5341.8 --> 5344.820000000001
it kind of breaks it

5345.52 --> 5353.219
I've

5347.26 --> 5353.219
broken it and rebuilt it all my life

5354.239 --> 5360.099999999999
explaining myself has been the way that

5357.94 --> 5362.199
I got control over myself

5360.1 --> 5364.719
so I don't have that issue

5362.199 --> 5367.12
I can explain anything I see or

5364.719 --> 5369.46
understand it's just

5367.12 --> 5372.159
there might be consequences for making

5369.46 --> 5374.9800000000005
certain things explicable

5372.159 --> 5377.08
that's the challenge for me

5374.98 --> 5379.299999999999
not whether I can make something

5377.08 --> 5382.0199999999995
comprehensible because I'm very certain

5379.3 --> 5382.02
that I can

5390.159 --> 5394.96
but thank you

5392.08 --> 5398.38
I thank you glad you appreciate

5394.96 --> 5400.56
I'm glad that my skill is appreciated I

5398.38 --> 5400.56
mean

5402.159 --> 5408.839999999999
you got to do it I got a skill I gotta

5404.5 --> 5408.84
use it right use it or lose it

5410.92 --> 5415.2390000000005
anyway

5412.48 --> 5416.49
I'm going to take a two in break

warm into this last half hour

5668.86 --> 5673.96
Simon Dan off but on but apparently I

5672.1 --> 5676.900000000001
didn't see him live there in there so

5673.96 --> 5679.06
maybe it was like a no-show I don't know

5676.9 --> 5681.4
I wasn't actually watching flat swords

5679.06 --> 5685.080000000001
to be fair

5681.4 --> 5685.08
I was watching gimbab

5685.36 --> 5689.5599999999995
check up on him he didn't actually ban

5688.06 --> 5691.360000000001
me apparently

5689.56 --> 5694.26
but Jim Bob hadn't really been live

5691.36 --> 5694.259999999999
streaming for a while

5694.3 --> 5702.42
it seemed like he was a bit better

5697.78 --> 5702.42
but it was still changed

5702.96 --> 5709.56
20 bucks oh

5706.96 --> 5709.56

5734.92 --> 5740.219
should I round out early what is what do

5737.44 --> 5740.219
other people think

5740.26 --> 5745.7390000000005
I mean maybe you guys want to hear me

5742.179 --> 5745.7390000000005

5749.62 --> 5755.26

all is well on the Western Front good to

5777.34 --> 5779.52
hear

5783.159 --> 5790.799999999999
although yeah I I hope that situation in

5787.0 --> 5790.8
Ohio is kind of worrisome though

5791.739 --> 5796.199
I mean that's a lot of toxic [ __ ]

5803.58 --> 5807.88
PG version okay

5823.659 --> 5831.099999999999
pgr

5826.179 --> 5832.179
what so it's like a spooky movie then is

5831.1 --> 5834.52
it

5832.179 --> 5837.4
PG horror I mean

5834.52 --> 5839.620000000001
this yeah I mean that can't really be

5837.4 --> 5842.4
hard and it's more like a spooky movie

5839.62 --> 5842.4
that is it

5842.62 --> 5847.92
I mean what the hell kind of pgo like

5845.56 --> 5847.92
what

5859.48 --> 5863.218999999999
thank you

5860.199 --> 5863.219
I don't get it

5870.52 --> 5875.56
right

5873.1 --> 5879.159000000001
that's how it is this is the spooky

5875.56 --> 5879.159000000001
movie okay hilarious

5879.34 --> 5884.32
all right so guys what do you say

5882.1 --> 5887.88
should I go get some groceries right now

5884.32 --> 5887.88
I ran out early or

5890.26 --> 5893.639
there's something you want to talk about

5894.699 --> 5900.78
Nature Boy already said he doesn't mind

5897.34 --> 5900.78
although he said we

5907.38 --> 5912.900000000001
abduction and a supernatural okay

5915.04 --> 5919.0
hmm

5916.42 --> 5920.9800000000005
all right well maybe if I bump into it

5919.0 --> 5923.28
on Netflix or something I I might check

5920.98 --> 5923.28
it out

5929.1 --> 5933.84
psychological Thriller

5931.239 --> 5933.839999999999
okay

5946.42 --> 5951.04
okay shall I round up

5949.36 --> 5954.599999999999
I'm not sure still

5951.04 --> 5954.6
it's on Netflix okay cool

5959.22 --> 5962.52
[Music]

5968.32 --> 5973.48
I think it might be like a not a a

5971.199 --> 5974.62
reviewing show so it might be worth it

5973.48 --> 5977.699
actually

5974.62 --> 5977.699
being on there

5978.219 --> 5982.44
talking about letters debates

5990.34 --> 5995.88
okay yeah I guess I'll put it on my list

5993.04 --> 5995.88
black phone

5995.98 --> 5999.239
see what that's like

6004.08 --> 6010.32
oh you by the way I I watched the movie

6007.02 --> 6014.040000000001
a while ago but then I got sick

6010.32 --> 6016.38
if you want to see like a like a really

6014.04 --> 6018.719
reenacted

6016.38 --> 6021.26
like

6018.719 --> 6021.26
what is it

6022.28 --> 6027.36
medieval

6024.0 --> 6029.34
maybe somewhere Renaissance it seems

6027.36 --> 6031.139
very many but like a really a

6029.34 --> 6033.42
reenactment movie

6031.139 --> 6037.9800000000005
about like a

6033.42 --> 6040.7390000000005
a wolf hunter in Spain in the mountains

6037.98 --> 6042.959999999999
it's like people barely talk in that

6040.739 --> 6046.678999999999
movie it's so wild

6042.96 --> 6048.36
and then check out skin of the Wolf

6046.679 --> 6050.46
right

6048.36 --> 6052.259999999999
actually watch those two movies uh

6050.46 --> 6056.9
remember the other one

6052.26 --> 6056.900000000001
uh the on the ice the Ice movie

6057.239 --> 6062.099999999999
crossing the ice or something about the

6060.0 --> 6064.08
Greenland exploration I watched that one

6062.1 --> 6066.659000000001
right after skin of the wolf which is

6064.08 --> 6069.719
very similar although skin of the wolf

6066.659 --> 6072.0599999999995
is also very gritty in a way I mean

6069.719 --> 6074.639
in that movie it's it's he's like a

6072.06 --> 6077.76
caveman and he eat women are actually

6074.639 --> 6079.92
treated like Commodities very overtly

6077.76 --> 6083.34
but like

6079.92 --> 6085.9800000000005
it's really reenactment it's it was very

6083.34 --> 6088.46
interesting overall

6085.98 --> 6091.138999999999
and gritty

6088.46 --> 6094.38
but interesting because it just seems so

6091.139 --> 6096.3
genuine in a way so you that might be an

6094.38 --> 6097.619
interesting thing it's a Spanish Falcon

6096.3 --> 6099.78
movie

6097.619 --> 6102.54
so yeah but of course they have

6099.78 --> 6104.719
subtitles also on Netflix skin of the

6102.54 --> 6104.719
Wolf

6105.8 --> 6111.96
beware if you're a feminist you're

6109.139 --> 6114.659000000001
really gonna [ __ ] hate this movie

6111.96 --> 6116.58
just warning you

6114.659 --> 6119.159
you're a lady you're a little easily

6116.58 --> 6120.659
triggerable by like abuse from men or

6119.159 --> 6123.0
something it's not like it's they're

6120.659 --> 6125.759999999999
constantly beating women or anything

6123.0 --> 6127.44
but it's just like yeah women inherit

6125.76 --> 6129.6
obviously like they don't have [ __ ] to

6127.44 --> 6131.58
say they're basically like traded like

6129.6 --> 6133.8
commodities

6131.58 --> 6136.5
and that did actually happen back then

6133.8 --> 6140.3
so it is really a reenactment movie

6136.5 --> 6140.3
it might be interesting to watch

6143.28 --> 6150.179
it's also beautiful landscapes

6146.58 --> 6153.32
a lot of a lot of nature

6150.179 --> 6153.32
and a lot of snow

6155.219 --> 6160.5
but you have like all kinds of scenes

6156.719 --> 6162.9
where they just climb rocks and

6160.5 --> 6164.46
all kinds it's I liked it it was very

6162.9 --> 6165.9
picturesque

6164.46 --> 6168.36
very raw

6165.9 --> 6170.04
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

6168.36 --> 6172.799999999999
show

6170.04 --> 6176.1
do check it out and I'm I will check out

6172.8 --> 6178.8

6176.1 --> 6181.5
