finances as much as possible because I'm

291.43 --> 301.03000000000003

293.56 --> 303.43
the fork Lee and I got enough bread yeah

301.03 --> 305.73999999999995
Major Tom I deleted that threat because

303.43 --> 310.479
it turned into straight out annoying

305.74 --> 316.68
trolling again you know sometimes I keep

310.479 --> 320.83
those really annoying comments that that

316.68 --> 323.169
pretend to be a genuine inquiry right I

320.83 --> 326.409
keep them around for a while just to see

323.169 --> 328.81
if it might go anywhere constructive and

326.409 --> 330.729
then when it doesn't and and the rest of

328.81 --> 333.01
the trolls pile on then I delete it I

330.729 --> 336.01
could have just deleted it outright

333.01 --> 338.8
because of just what it was probably

336.01 --> 343.419
gonna turn out to be but I didn't so I

338.8 --> 346.33
did it afterward cleaning up the [ __ ]

343.419 --> 347.139
don't like it when people poo on my

346.33 --> 353.34
doorstep

347.139 --> 353.34000000000003
that's what those comments are like so

355.86 --> 361.5
[Music]

360.08 --> 364.85999999999996
huh

361.5 --> 370.34
QE fees versus my quest now I didn't see

364.86 --> 372.56
that when was it a rerun was that life I

370.34 --> 378.09
have no idea what you're talking about

372.56 --> 380.61
Laurie or it could just be complete

378.09 --> 384.83
nonsense that you just made up to draw

380.61 --> 384.83000000000004
attention anyway

386.48 --> 394.41
no no Major Tom it's not it's just more

392.13 --> 396.65999999999997
[ __ ] to distract yourself from

394.41 --> 399.6
confronting yourself with the facts that

396.66 --> 403.32000000000005
what that is it's not so true

399.6 --> 410.34000000000003
it's a deviation all you do is deviate

403.32 --> 412.2
major Tom you especially know it's been

410.34 --> 418.66999999999996
kind of fun having you around in chat

412.2 --> 422.25
but you're turning more annoying yeah I

418.67 --> 426.12
don't appreciate that I don't like it

422.25 --> 428.1
when people that were trolls that kind

426.12 --> 431.66
of turn into real people turn back into

428.1 --> 431.66
trolls I don't appreciate that

434.18 --> 440.639
[Music]

435.349 --> 442.069
okay okay Lottie you don't need to do

440.639 --> 446.19
that

442.069 --> 448.74
but okay apparently they did something

446.19 --> 451.02
on the discord server for real sure I

448.74 --> 457.229
guess I'll I'll see it back somewhere

451.02 --> 459.12
whenever it's gonna be present no really

457.229 --> 461.81899999999996
a really major time if you're a real

459.12 --> 464.99
person then why do we use an icon of

461.819 --> 469.94
David Bowie why don't you actually

464.99 --> 469.94
identify yourself you're so real

477.89 --> 480.95
[Music]

484.75 --> 491.44
yeah mark color i deleted it because he

487.72 --> 493.24
said fu and don't allow people in chat

491.44 --> 496.11
to address me like that under any

493.24 --> 496.11
circumstances

501.88 --> 507.4
even though I might have been wrong with

503.77 --> 510.09
my original assertion about Lottie it

507.4 --> 512.5
was not that strange assertion to make

510.09 --> 517.62
because he does make up [ __ ] out of

512.5 --> 517.62
nothing at times when he feels like it a

521.94 --> 531.6
really major Tom why why are they

525.87 --> 535.78
getting fed up like said as in full

531.6 --> 539.38
eaten feeding fed up with Flat Earth

535.78 --> 542.26
crap so what are what specifically what

539.38 --> 548.25
is the crap that you're getting so full

542.26 --> 548.25
of magic Tom why don't you tell me that

552.47 --> 557.48
you said about animal what I don't

555.86 --> 561.23
remember what you said but it's probably

557.48 --> 570.04
not true it's probably just you being a

561.23 --> 570.04
dick yeah

579.39 --> 586.769
all right yeah well what made your

582.329 --> 590.04
tongue what pisses you off about it so

586.769 --> 594.8100000000001
much you know I can re asked this

590.04 --> 598.38
question a thousand different ways until

594.81 --> 604.1099999999999
you answer it because I heard you and

598.38 --> 607.38
now I want to see why I want to see if

604.11 --> 610.23
you have an opening somewhere in your

607.38 --> 612.51
brain in order to allow yourself to

610.23 --> 615.019
establish what is actually going on

612.51 --> 615.019
Major Tom

622.44 --> 632.6
so what what flat because it is a lie

627.44 --> 632.6
that that doesn't make any sense

637.25 --> 641.839
you know Oh Major Tom

642.74 --> 650.819
you know officially provably there's a

647.49 --> 653.85
lot of lies out there besides flood

650.819 --> 659.399
earth which you think is a lie right so

653.85 --> 662.97
why do you and so many others come every

659.399 --> 667.8
day to our channels with our activities

662.97 --> 670.259
meant for us specifically why do you

667.8 --> 674.459
come back here if this is such a

670.259 --> 676.7090000000001
terrible terrible lie then why don't you

674.459 --> 683.189
go after some other lighter actually

676.709 --> 686.66
proven license did you know why is this

683.189 --> 690.18
so important to you why is Flat Earth

686.66 --> 694.05
presumed to be a lie by you so important

690.18 --> 695.279
that you'd get out there every day every

694.05 --> 698.0089999999999
freaking day

695.279 --> 702.389
you get over here and you hate it so

698.009 --> 705.899
much because it's a lie it's a lie are

702.389 --> 710.759
you looking at yourself what are you

705.899 --> 714.18
doing why why are you doing why are you

710.759 --> 718.98
coming here and doing this [ __ ] every

714.18 --> 723.2399999999999
single time why do you ignore everything

718.98 --> 726.12
why do you just say no you know what we

723.24 --> 729.149
can hear hours of just personal straight

726.12 --> 733.529
improvised talk people reflecting their

729.149 --> 738.87
ideas and then just generally conclude

733.529 --> 743.069
about it all now it's just a lie how

738.87 --> 747.589
honest is that how is that even possible

743.069 --> 751.259
have you ever had an experience with

747.589 --> 754.7090000000001
very elaborate personal spontaneous

751.259 --> 756.24
conversations where afterward you could

754.709 --> 758.55
actually prove and point

756.24 --> 761.22
that every single detail was a complete

758.55 --> 764.79
lie every everything about prove it

761.22 --> 767.3090000000001
not just suggest or say it is like have

764.79 --> 768.779
you ever do you have any examples of

767.309 --> 772.11
this I'd like to hear it

768.779 --> 773.939
because I don't think conversations like

772.11 --> 776.939
that work like that so it's very

773.939 --> 779.3689999999999
blatantly obvious you are literally in

776.939 --> 781.949
your mind over generalizing everything

779.369 --> 786.24
that's being talked about ignoring it to

781.949 --> 791.429
replace all of it all of it the stamp

786.24 --> 793.619
it's a lie you don't even know what it

791.429 --> 797.929
is you don't even know what was said you

793.619 --> 802.22
don't remember you just have this is

797.929 --> 804.449
universal memory very basic it's a lie

802.22 --> 806.9390000000001
don't know anything about it though

804.449 --> 808.92
don't know the details don't remember

806.939 --> 811.019
the arguments because we have to repeat

808.92 --> 815.3
them over and over and over again every

811.019 --> 823.319
single day to the man to the person to

815.3 --> 824.9699999999999
the chat but still know it's a lie how

823.319 --> 828.049
does that make you feel when I when I

824.97 --> 828.049
put it to you like that

830.449 --> 838.7589999999999
Major Tom and yeah that's very nice you

834.569 --> 842.49
have a job but despite that job of yours

838.759 --> 845.6
you're coming here every day and the

842.49 --> 849.779
Flat Earth debates and all that [ __ ]

845.6 --> 852.24
every day because you hate the lies so

849.779 --> 853.949
much even though you don't really know

852.24 --> 858.029
what they are you just know what you

853.949 --> 859.5889999999999
learned and then you are just flipping

858.029 --> 862.17
the switch in your mind and saying like

859.589 --> 864.0290000000001
okay what I learn is the truth even if

862.17 --> 865.579
it doesn't make any [ __ ] sense even

864.029 --> 867.779
though I don't have any proof for it and

865.579 --> 870.66
everything that contradicts that or

867.779 --> 873.299
suggest in any way that that's wrong is

870.66 --> 875.2199999999999
a lie is that it is that is that you're

873.299 --> 880.16
a little program that's running in your

875.22 --> 883.11
head is it terrible to be just

880.16 --> 887.31
pre-programmed with less of a conscious

883.11 --> 890.069
to function like a robot shut it off

887.31 --> 895.41
to eat purposely and systematically

890.069 --> 905.2489999999999
ignore information like that must be a

895.41 --> 908.91
terrible existence let's see nah just

905.249 --> 912.059
leave him you know they're they're all

908.91 --> 915.149
piling in because yeah they they wanted

912.059 --> 917.129
to they want to feel this they wouldn't

915.149 --> 918.959
they want to feel this because at first

917.129 --> 920.639
they think that it's oh it's our wind

918.959 --> 923.7489999999999
that's going oh there might be something

920.639 --> 927.809
on him not realizing that I'm actually

923.749 --> 931.379
pointing straight at everything that

927.809 --> 933.54
this feeling that's coming off me

931.379 --> 935.04
actually has a context in the thing that

933.54 --> 938.16
I'm saying butts very hard to make out

935.04 --> 941.04
because they're not listening to what

938.16 --> 944.579
I'm saying not even to the first layer

941.04 --> 947.2489999999999
of meaning and there's many of them it's

944.579 --> 948.87
just that naturally happens it's because

947.249 --> 950.5790000000001
of understanding but they don't listen

948.87 --> 953.22
to the word it just listen to the

950.579 --> 955.7399999999999
feeling I think all excited oh that's is

953.22 --> 958.379
you're gonna raise your garden oh and

955.74 --> 960.3290000000001
they're all piling in not realizing that

958.379 --> 964.6800000000001
I'm pointing straight at them that these

960.329 --> 967.41
feelings have a context that we a a lot

964.68 --> 969.87
of people understand and they don't

967.41 --> 972.779
because they don't listen to the words

969.87 --> 976.5
behind the feelings they don't they're

972.779 --> 978.809
just fishing for recognition of their

976.5 --> 983.759
constructs that they have learned that

978.809 --> 987.66
they're terrified to let go literally

983.759 --> 991.439
worse than death kind of threat in their

987.66 --> 993.75
hearts terrified to let it go and the

991.439 --> 997.319
only thing they could do is fish they

993.75 --> 1001.339
recognize anything about that like a

997.319 --> 1003.829
computer like a robot see is that the

1001.339 --> 1006.35
information is the information correct

1003.829 --> 1011.8389999999999
in accordance to what I have learned and

1006.35 --> 1014.899
must accept yes or no okay results okay

1011.839 --> 1018.23
anything that confirms what we learn is

1014.899 --> 1020.899
true anything contradicting what we

1018.23 --> 1024.199
learned is a lie that's

1020.899 --> 1027.11
just fishing just fishing fishing for

1024.199 --> 1028.939
the feelings you still have a universal

1027.11 --> 1031.9699999999998
feeling recognition system that's

1028.939 --> 1035.27
separate that's not directly bound into

1031.97 --> 1037.73
the conceptualization of reality itself

1035.27 --> 1039.649
you still have your own options to

1037.73 --> 1043.22
respond with feelings to recognize them

1039.649 --> 1045.35
but you can't properly place my feelings

1043.22 --> 1048.799
in a context that makes sense to you

1045.35 --> 1050.6299999999999
because you don't listen to the words I

1048.799 --> 1052.279
say you don't understand what I'm

1050.63 --> 1055.5200000000002
talking about you don't understand the

1052.279 --> 1060.2
context the meaning why I say these

1055.52 --> 1064.85
things that's why you're all piling in

1060.2 --> 1068.539
all fascinated all like a bunch of blind

1064.85 --> 1070.61
witches fascinated to see what's going

1068.539 --> 1073.1
on they want to see it but they can only

1070.61 --> 1075.559
hear it because they're blind they

1073.1 --> 1077.87
they're just so curious as what would be

1075.559 --> 1080.1789999999999
visible there that's what it's like

1077.87 --> 1083.09
that's what you guysyou trolls you

1080.179 --> 1087.169
ballers that's what it's like for you

1083.09 --> 1091.1899999999998
you come in blind curious as to what I

1087.169 --> 1093.94
see but you can only listen you can't

1091.19 --> 1093.94
understand it

1101.82 --> 1109.96
well bandsaw bandit the problem is with

1104.76 --> 1111.85
it's not a choice it's it is a choice

1109.96 --> 1115.14
but it's not a choice it's not a choice

1111.85 --> 1119.6499999999999
to the consciousness it's a choice

1115.14 --> 1122.65
that's not in the spot where the focus

1119.65 --> 1126.0900000000001
is on the choice is much deeper much

1122.65 --> 1128.2900000000002
more with personal self-worth and

1126.09 --> 1131.59
responsibility entanglement to the

1128.29 --> 1134.23
entire universe and God that's where

1131.59 --> 1138.01
it's really at not the shape of the

1134.23 --> 1140.53
earth not the arguments that's just

1138.01 --> 1143.26
distraction to them that's what was used

1140.53 --> 1145.0
as the distraction to keep them busy to

1143.26 --> 1147.22
keep them focused on that in order for

1145.0 --> 1149.59
them to ignore what is actually real

1147.22 --> 1153.1200000000001
ignore the warnings they get from God

1149.59 --> 1158.47
from within from within their souls

1153.12 --> 1160.57
until in the end nothing is left but the

1158.47 --> 1162.55
distraction but the image but the

1160.57 --> 1165.73
program and the rest just becomes

1162.55 --> 1169.95
nonsense to them it's just screeching

1165.73 --> 1169.95
they don't understand what it is anymore

1173.58 --> 1183.1499999999999
yeah why don't you look it up Allenby I

1176.14 --> 1183.15
got several videos now piss off [ __ ]

1183.84 --> 1188.35
any more of those types of

1185.95 --> 1194.14
misinformation [ __ ] remarks and

1188.35 --> 1196.9299999999998
you're banned anyone if you're just

1194.14 --> 1199.42
gonna suggest a straight-out lie that's

1196.93 --> 1201.97
very easily proven to be a lie and that

1199.42 --> 1203.77
doesn't even concern if you say flutter

1201.97 --> 1206.68
this a lie that doesn't count in the

1203.77 --> 1207.6399999999999
same way it's just blatant provable lies

1206.68 --> 1210.16
you're banned

1207.64 --> 1212.3500000000001
I don't care if you think it's funny I

1210.16 --> 1214.66
don't care if you have some kind of

1212.35 --> 1216.6699999999998
standing or a routine that you do that

1214.66 --> 1218.53
you have associated with your character

1216.67 --> 1219.53
that you think you have to do you're

1218.53 --> 1221.28
banned

1219.53 --> 1225.79
[Music]

1221.28 --> 1228.66
no more false accusation [ __ ] done

1225.79 --> 1228.6599999999999
with it all of it

1231.549 --> 1238.67
mm right yeah all right exactly that's

1236.24 --> 1241.07
exactly what I meant

1238.67 --> 1245.5900000000001
Dave Johnson that's exactly what you get

1241.07 --> 1245.59
banned for that's it

1253.14 --> 1258.3600000000001
I didn't even see what was going on I'm

1256.35 --> 1262.04
still addressing ballers I haven't

1258.36 --> 1267.1399999999999
really read the chat until Ellen B and

1262.04 --> 1271.3799999999999
Dave Johnson demanded to get banned as

1267.14 --> 1276.0800000000002
for what Karen B does I'm all good with

1271.38 --> 1279.0590000000002
that I support every single chat

1276.08 --> 1282.12
moderation decision she makes even if it

1279.059 --> 1290.61
is irrational even if it is over the top

1282.12 --> 1294.3899999999999
because screw you okay did he

1290.61 --> 1296.76
okay that's not good yeah Missouri bear

1294.39 --> 1303.169
don't don't call other people pedophiles

1296.76 --> 1303.169
just no matter what that's not good

1306.8 --> 1313.1
yeah you know you know what happens if

1310.52 --> 1316.1299999999999
you do that in big bears chat pretty

1313.1 --> 1318.02
much the same thing unless you yeah

1316.13 --> 1321.3500000000001
they're significant proof for this so

1318.02 --> 1323.21
don't do that you know he's all kinds of

1321.35 --> 1329.3899999999999
things terrible terrible things but I

1323.21 --> 1330.89
don't think he could even do I don't I

1329.39 --> 1333.5800000000002
don't even want to think about it I

1330.89 --> 1333.5800000000002
think it's unlikely

1341.06 --> 1344.06
yeah

1346.4 --> 1356.77
I gots hilarious Simon then that's

1349.88 --> 1360.2600000000002
really funny I sympathize with them I

1356.77 --> 1362.99
know exactly what it is to grow up with

1360.26 --> 1365.93
a dad that you eventually figured out is

1362.99 --> 1368.3
a complete [ __ ] now I was lucky enough

1365.93 --> 1371.3600000000001
that my dad went through a spiritual

1368.3 --> 1375.32
significant transformation but that

1371.36 --> 1378.59
happened well in his 50s and before that

1375.32 --> 1383.57
he was a freaking [ __ ] he had

1378.59 --> 1386.48
delusions he was petty he was selfish in

1383.57 --> 1389.3899999999999
a way where he was convinced that it was

1386.48 --> 1394.31
actually selfless it was very annoying I

1389.39 --> 1398.15
hated that and ya didn't really respect

1394.31 --> 1400.25
my dad growing up so yeah just a little

1398.15 --> 1401.72
hint as to what you can be expecting in

1400.25 --> 1404.66
the future with those three kids

1401.72 --> 1408.26
although I don't know maybe maybe you

1404.66 --> 1411.4
will find the courage that you need and

1408.26 --> 1411.4
all that

1418.429 --> 1423.3200000000002
maybe you'll be able to do it well

1420.6 --> 1426.27
before your 50s there will be good

1423.32 --> 1428.87
they'll save everybody 20 years of

1426.27 --> 1428.87
nonsense

1431.58 --> 1436.9189999999999
[Music]

1440.38 --> 1445.8400000000001
no but I look that's the thing I didn't

1443.23 --> 1451.45
feed the trolls he said he had three

1445.84 --> 1454.8999999999999
kids I made a serious analysis yeah I

1451.45 --> 1457.8400000000001
know yeah Simon dan hey hey hey hey when

1454.9 --> 1460.3300000000002
I was four I believed the globe

1457.84 --> 1463.84
I didn't only believe the globe I wanted

1460.33 --> 1465.76
to become an astronaut I was furious

1463.84 --> 1468.549
when anyone would tell me that I

1465.76 --> 1471.09
couldn't be I designed and drew

1468.549 --> 1474.73
spaceships I still have the drawings I

1471.09 --> 1476.799
literally was very proud insisted on

1474.73 --> 1483.64
becoming an astronaut so oh yeah

1476.799 --> 1487.4189999999999
oh yeah that's yeah that's what happens

1483.64 --> 1489.669
when you're a little kid it's very easy

1487.419 --> 1492.88
to fall into that and it'll be glorious

1489.669 --> 1497.1100000000001
at the time the experience to them will

1492.88 --> 1499.99
be great but they will eventually also

1497.11 --> 1503.02
get the other side of it and that is the

1499.99 --> 1505.299
consequence and then when they do then

1503.02 --> 1508.78
they either break in their minds or they

1505.299 --> 1512.11
wake up and then they reach spiritual

1508.78 --> 1514.87
adulthood something that you apparently

1512.11 --> 1517.03
haven't attained yet and then when they

1514.87 --> 1519.28
do if they do then they will recognize

1517.03 --> 1525.87
that you have not attained that and then

1519.28 --> 1525.87
they will test you just saying

1531.5 --> 1540.03
yeah you see lebryk ah it's not a matter

1536.52 --> 1543.45
of how smart you are whether you believe

1540.03 --> 1549.0
in something to assert that is beyond

1543.45 --> 1551.82
[ __ ] it is very very dumb to think

1549.0 --> 1554.1
that but yeah I was very smart I'm still

1551.82 --> 1557.49
very smart I still understand all the

1554.1 --> 1559.53
[ __ ] that I learned that's why I'm so

1557.49 --> 1562.74
good at presupposing the freaking globe

1559.53 --> 1566.52
that's why I can construct scenarios in

1562.74 --> 1569.88
space and science fiction probably too a

1566.52 --> 1574.41
way higher degree than one than the vast

1569.88 --> 1578.1000000000001
vast majority of ballers because I am

1574.41 --> 1580.679
smart and it was a lovely playing around

1578.1 --> 1582.36
outer space spaceships

1580.679 --> 1584.73
it was a great playing ground it

1582.36 --> 1588.1789999999999
reflected itself greatly in my space

1584.73 --> 1590.07
Legos as well that I very proud to still

1588.179 --> 1593.64
have the designs that I made when it was

1590.07 --> 1595.6499999999999
six let's still have it I'll show it one

1593.64 --> 1602.0700000000002
day I literally still have it in a box

1595.65 --> 1605.1000000000001
as it was but it's a toy it's a

1602.07 --> 1608.1599999999999
conceptual toy in the mind and in the

1605.1 --> 1610.62
Legos that's something that you figure

1608.16 --> 1613.53
out when you grow to spiritual adulthood

1610.62 --> 1616.29
when you really know you just can't

1613.53 --> 1620.25
distinguish from what is real what is

1616.29 --> 1622.83
not real what can never be real that's

1620.25 --> 1629.13
when you start to get it and that's when

1622.83 --> 1631.32
the smarts transform into wisdom because

1629.13 --> 1633.72
you could be smart figure everything out

1631.32 --> 1635.25
almost instantly but if you don't have

1633.72 --> 1638.309
the consciousness if you don't have no

1635.25 --> 1639.9
reflection to it as to what it really

1638.309 --> 1642.6499999999999
means because you don't have the

1639.9 --> 1646.3200000000002
experience then all that intelligence as

1642.65 --> 1650.76
it all presents itself to you will also

1646.32 --> 1652.83
bring you greater misunderstanding then

1650.76 --> 1655.29
you can ever comprehend at the time

1652.83 --> 1658.23
because that is how it works if you

1655.29 --> 1660.99
don't have the wisdom the spiritual

1658.23 --> 1663.9
adulthood to temper your intelligence

1660.99 --> 1670.97
then your intelligence will rule you

1663.9 --> 1674.39
with its delusions the aberrations does

1670.97 --> 1674.39
that's the problem

1682.56 --> 1686.7
yeah sorry by the way I saw your super

1685.11 --> 1688.62
chat earlier I kind of forgot it was in

1686.7 --> 1691.32
the middle of it a rant

1688.62 --> 1693.51
Thank You Julie Oh Pavan for the second

1691.32 --> 1699.96
time let me read out the first superjet

1693.51 --> 1702.39

1699.96 --> 1702.75
get to the first one or did I shout it

1702.39 --> 1705.3600000000001

1702.75 --> 1709.22

1705.36 --> 1712.2199999999998
stop by PPS

1709.22 --> 1714.63
yeah I guess it's too late for that

1712.22 --> 1715.59
second superjet hope you didn't skip

1714.63 --> 1722.91
this one as well

1715.59 --> 1726.9599999999998
yep I did third super Chad guys just

1722.91 --> 1733.8000000000002
tell him to check PayPal Wow okay thanks

1726.96 --> 1738.99
man appreciate it check it out

1733.8 --> 1743.18
sorry for for rambling on overlooking

1738.99 --> 1743.18
the chat check it out

1743.35 --> 1746.48
[Music]

1756.84 --> 1759.84
whoa

1760.74 --> 1770.27
man damn dude okay that's that's gonna

1766.799 --> 1778.1
help Wow

1770.27 --> 1781.1399999999999
$50 from Giulio Pavan bang I know words

1778.1 --> 1784.7099999999998
it's a huge amount it's gonna make a big

1781.14 --> 1789.39
difference to me like really serious so

1784.71 --> 1796.559
thank you a huge amount literally great

1789.39 --> 1800.1000000000001
bunch Giulio Pavan Wow that I think that

1796.559 --> 1803.309
may actually bridge that gap finally

1800.1 --> 1806.1299999999999
I'll need to have to look into it but

1803.309 --> 1808.26
thank you so much thank you for the

1806.13 --> 1812.669
support and thank you everyone for the

1808.26 --> 1816.11
support the continual support well

1812.669 --> 1816.1100000000001
since the early bird show

1820.93 --> 1827.29
well trick or tral yeah I know it's it's

1825.22 --> 1830.29
so sad right that somebody can

1827.29 --> 1835.05
appreciate what apparently to you is so

1830.29 --> 1838.42
worth so little but now for me you know

1835.05 --> 1840.73
how my conceptualization of what money

1838.42 --> 1844.99
is worth to me is size down greatly I

1840.73 --> 1851.08
would rather say that tenfold so to me

1844.99 --> 1853.15
$50 feels like getting $500 not but damn

1851.08 --> 1859.51
well feels like it and I can do so much

1853.15 --> 1864.3100000000002
with it so it's potentially like for

1859.51 --> 1867.25
example week a week of dinners so thank

1864.31 --> 1867.73
you so much thank you for helping me out

1867.25 --> 1871.68
okay

1867.73 --> 1874.65
I'm done with that anyway yeah that's I

1871.68 --> 1879.67
appreciate it

1874.65 --> 1881.5600000000002
let's get back oh wait I was talking

1879.67 --> 1885.46
about baller psychology and the

1881.56 --> 1889.87
spiritual adulthood discerning between

1885.46 --> 1894.51
the imagination realm of what could be

1889.87 --> 1899.5
and what can never be and reality yeah I

1894.51 --> 1901.72
think that it's probably gonna pain a

1899.5 --> 1906.07
lot of people but I am gonna call that

1901.72 --> 1908.1100000000001
spiritual adulthood and in a way Flat

1906.07 --> 1910.21
Earth is a part of it and I know it's

1908.11 --> 1915.4299999999998
just like kicking everybody in the dick

1910.21 --> 1919.15
now on the ball side I understand but to

1915.43 --> 1921.76
be fair in reflection to how I have been

1919.15 --> 1923.92
confronted with Flat Earth be way before

1921.76 --> 1925.6
all this and I described the many times

1923.92 --> 1930.78
throughout my life when that sort of

1925.6 --> 1934.56
while that happened and I rejected it

1930.78 --> 1938.44
because it wasn't spiritually old it was

1934.56 --> 1942.97
present as if this was an adulthood

1938.44 --> 1945.3400000000001
thing to me from the yeah the sources of

1942.97 --> 1948.4
those traditions is was part of it so I

1945.34 --> 1952.12
think that it's really not that far away

1948.4 --> 1954.52
of the truth that Flat Earth is indeed

1952.12 --> 1960.2199999999998
part of well

1954.52 --> 1965.08
spiritual adulthood awakening and in

1960.22 --> 1969.4
reflection you could also upgrade that

1965.08 --> 1973.36
concept to the entire society the true

1969.4 --> 1978.22
renaissance when the dreams of the young

1973.36 --> 1981.1899999999998
are dropped and responsibility

1978.22 --> 1984.15
responsibility for the real world is

1981.19 --> 1984.15
taken more seriously

1984.24 --> 1996.09
spiritual awakening spiritual adulthood

1989.34 --> 1996.09
old dreams false dreams let go

2000.2 --> 2004.48
yeah piss off

2005.94 --> 2011.15
and you too it's not funny

2021.029 --> 2027.629
all right but yeah it's very obvious I

2024.329 --> 2039.6889999999999
definitely take on some ballers with

2027.629 --> 2044.519
that one it's it is super tough it is

2039.689 --> 2046.8890000000001
super tough especially because as I say

2044.519 --> 2050.419
this ever even if I as I use the words

2046.889 --> 2054.269
it probably triggers deeper memories

2050.419 --> 2057.359
putting far far away just like my own as

2054.269 --> 2059.22
I said it's not the first time I've been

2057.359 --> 2062.129
confronted with flattered that happened

2059.22 --> 2064.0789999999997
several times throughout my life if that

2062.129 --> 2066.839
is the case even in a world where it's

2064.079 --> 2069.809
all concealed where it wasn't out in the

2066.839 --> 2072.2
media that's way before 2015 well then

2069.809 --> 2074.96
there is a very great likelihood that a

2072.2 --> 2077.879
numerous amount of people in the world

2074.96 --> 2079.71
have gone through similar things and

2077.879 --> 2081.899
have been confronted with similar

2079.71 --> 2084.599
concepts originating from the same

2081.899 --> 2088.169
groups and therefore I think it probably

2084.599 --> 2091.5
triggers some very suppressed memories

2088.169 --> 2093.359
of people actually being told this is

2091.5 --> 2094.919
part of spiritual adulthood and that

2093.359 --> 2097.98
must have and then they stepped away

2094.919 --> 2101.759
just like I did then and that must kick

2097.98 --> 2104.609
people in the dicks super hard to subtly

2101.759 --> 2108.48
remember that as their entire focus ever

2104.609 --> 2112.319
since has been to evade memory - then

2108.48 --> 2114.66
get such a memory closed back in focus

2112.319 --> 2121.799
all of a sudden must be very painful if

2114.66 --> 2126.66
if you've underwent that but maybe I am

2121.799 --> 2130.2889999999998
being too too hopeful because I don't

2126.66 --> 2133.049
know if you if you just accept the lies

2130.289 --> 2136.5890000000004
more and more knowingly as you go then

2133.049 --> 2138.69
eventually you can't you couldn't even

2136.589 --> 2144.589
remember if you wanted to even if you

2138.69 --> 2144.589
wanted to but I dare not imagine

2146.12 --> 2157.94
that's like doom she just can't remember

2149.3 --> 2161.17
the truth anymore that's doom yeah I

2157.94 --> 2161.17
can't be it usually is

2176.63 --> 2183.63
his gas station space Starbucks space

2180.48 --> 2186.45
hotels just like in space cowboys the

2183.63 --> 2188.7200000000003
movie remember it's pretty much all in

2186.45 --> 2188.72
there

2201.76 --> 2214.98
what what's going on did Simon then

2205.18 --> 2218.3689999999997
actually try to insert some arguments no

2214.98 --> 2218.369
not as much

2221.4 --> 2225.329
clean what are you doing

2228.96 --> 2242.7
what's that let me check it out whoa

2233.46 --> 2251.04
that is a big lens okay that's just yeah

2242.7 --> 2253.41
whatever yeah oh right yeah yeah but

2251.04 --> 2255.5099999999998
more coloured look the whole thing is

2253.41 --> 2258.359
we're still taking the concept of

2255.51 --> 2261.9300000000003
proving in science seriously they

2258.359 --> 2265.74
however have already bypassed that all

2261.93 --> 2268.589
by literally breaking the scientific

2265.74 --> 2272.7299999999996
method in front of everyone and saying

2268.589 --> 2275.43
no it's wrong and thereby they can

2272.73 --> 2279.48
simply say assert whatever they like

2275.43 --> 2282.93
according to them that's why they can

2279.48 --> 2284.309
say I proved it because it doesn't mean

2282.93 --> 2287.04
anymore

2284.309 --> 2289.46
what it really means to them because

2287.04 --> 2291.569
they're using their broken

2289.46 --> 2294.15
interpretation of what science is

2291.569 --> 2297.45
supposed to be instead of what it really

2294.15 --> 2300.21
is so they can assert that kind of

2297.45 --> 2303.0299999999997
[ __ ] all the time and they even

2300.21 --> 2307.73
think that they're right that they can

2303.03 --> 2307.73
get away with it by their own standards

2308.21 --> 2315.54
because yeah they're bypassing so much

2312.23 --> 2319.23
they've broken so much literally just

2315.54 --> 2321.8089999999997
say like no it's not it there's multiple

2319.23 --> 2323.25
methods can work differently it's all a

2321.809 --> 2325.53
matter of approach it's more about the

2323.25 --> 2327.72
philosophy battle it's anything but the

2325.53 --> 2329.8190000000004
core scientific method with the

2327.72 --> 2331.3489999999997
empirical experiment independent

2329.819 --> 2334.64
variable dependent variable no

2331.349 --> 2337.17
hypothesis no that does not matter

2334.64 --> 2340.0099999999998
whatever you're gonna say that doesn't

2337.17 --> 2344.88
matter science can be whatever this

2340.01 --> 2347.579
freak they want and therefore they can

2344.88 --> 2351.0
say prove and science in their

2347.579 --> 2353.309
assertions as much as they like and they

2351.0 --> 2355.44
feel they can get away with it because

2353.309 --> 2359.3590000000004
they already broke it all apart

2355.44 --> 2362.66
they already nullified everything every

2359.359 --> 2367.71
foundation of sensibility

2362.66 --> 2370.3199999999997
everything because they needed to to

2367.71 --> 2374.87
follow their religion was the only way

2370.32 --> 2374.8700000000003
and they accepted that

2375.77 --> 2379.929
[Music]

2391.05 --> 2394.05
Wow

2397.53 --> 2403.4900000000002
[Music]

2400.569 --> 2406.91
everybody's paying their respects all

2403.49 --> 2409.49
the ballers oh I'm too I touched them

2406.91 --> 2411.589
touch them in their heart and said Lee a

2409.49 --> 2414.47
piece of the heart broke off and they

2411.589 --> 2416.869
now feel the need to poop it out right

2414.47 --> 2419.3289999999997
in the chat that's what we're all seeing

2416.869 --> 2422.089
that's what happens when you actually

2419.329 --> 2425.6600000000003
touch somebody that is hiding everything

2422.089 --> 2431.63
for themselves that's when the demons

2425.66 --> 2433.8689999999997
come out and eject the vileness to try

2431.63 --> 2444.8900000000003
to counter the process of the actual

2433.869 --> 2447.71
awakening that's what we're seeing some

2444.89 --> 2451.8489999999997
and then you're all attack yeah okay

2447.71 --> 2454.64
he's pretty pathetic but to be fair in

2451.849 --> 2460.19
my chat he's been very civil so I have

2454.64 --> 2463.7
nothing really to to ban him over yes I

2460.19 --> 2465.4700000000003
don't see the problem here oh yeah

2463.7 --> 2467.6899999999996
joining the show that will be hilarious

2465.47 --> 2470.089
I'm not even gonna ask anymore because

2467.69 --> 2475.67
he's not gonna do it anyway he's just

2470.089 --> 2478.19
gonna try to first bait me and then deny

2475.67 --> 2480.5
and force me to get on some other

2478.19 --> 2482.75
platform to do it specifically in his

2480.5 --> 2485.9
prepared condition so he can enter his

2482.75 --> 2487.93
own constructed throne and guarantee his

2485.9 --> 2493.28
victory in his mind that's what he wants

2487.93 --> 2495.2599999999998
but that's not gonna happen because if

2493.28 --> 2498.38
he wants to talk with me you can do it

2495.26 --> 2503.4500000000003
right here through Skype and I will give

2498.38 --> 2506.859
him whatever time he needs I'm not just

2503.45 --> 2510.95
gonna outright hammer him on his idiocy

2506.859 --> 2514.7599999999998
you know I can do that afterwards but

2510.95 --> 2516.9399999999996
yeah he's still not gonna do it you know

2514.76 --> 2516.94
it

2523.02 --> 2527.82
[Music]

2524.57 --> 2531.48
yeah that is true spare room music you

2527.82 --> 2534.69
are definitely providing me a a great

2531.48 --> 2537.2
medium a great platform to do some very

2534.69 --> 2540.39
serious psychological studies and

2537.2 --> 2546.54
without the ballers I'd never had such a

2540.39 --> 2549.3599999999997
widely available flock of crazies of

2546.54 --> 2552.75
very specific type of crazies to learn

2549.36 --> 2558.6600000000003
from so yes I thank you for that I guess

2552.75 --> 2561.27
I thought the downs that come with it at

2558.66 --> 2565.14
least it gives me some study absolutely

2561.27 --> 2568.98
I don't know any group that is more

2565.14 --> 2571.1099999999997
crazy really than ballers in a in a

2568.98 --> 2573.84
delusional sense you know there's all

2571.11 --> 2575.85
kinds of cultures and even religious

2573.84 --> 2578.4300000000003
groups although don't over generalize

2575.85 --> 2580.62
and that is just groups of people that

2578.43 --> 2588.27
are pretty damn crazy in certain ways

2580.62 --> 2591.06
but the ballers are just so blatant it's

2588.27 --> 2595.11
so weird that it's so in the open and

2591.06 --> 2597.39
that's quite unique because most crazies

2595.11 --> 2603.21
out there some kind of cult or whatever

2597.39 --> 2607.77
they kind of know but these balls are

2603.21 --> 2612.15
just just throwing it all out there it

2607.77 --> 2613.68
is open insanity in a way and yeah it's

2612.15 --> 2616.88
nothing like that I've never seen

2613.68 --> 2623.73
anything like that in society anywhere

2616.88 --> 2628.6400000000003
media anything like this I think baller

2623.73 --> 2632.1
trolls in general probably redefined

2628.64 --> 2635.79
what internet trolls are because of

2632.1 --> 2639.21
their sheer quantity and because of the

2635.79 --> 2643.05
the depth that they sing to in relation

2639.21 --> 2645.12
to a lot of other trolls that get nasty

2643.05 --> 2648.0600000000004
in a row but it's more simple simple ism

2645.12 --> 2653.4
but no these are very refined nasty

2648.06 --> 2655.62
nasty trolls that really really try to

2653.4 --> 2657.119
lower the bar and higher the bar however

2655.62 --> 2660.3289999999997
you want to look at it in

2657.119 --> 2664.289
psychological warfare in personal attack

2660.329 --> 2670.099
in distraction deviation they literally

2664.289 --> 2670.099
turned the red herring system into a

2670.279 --> 2680.009
festival a fish slap a red herring fish

2676.289 --> 2684.4990000000003
slapping contest festival and they're

2680.009 --> 2687.599
all celebrating it doing it every day

2684.499 --> 2688.4399999999996
yeah you want show the truth it sounds

2687.599 --> 2691.98
so familiar

2688.44 --> 2695.2490000000003
there's just that's a certain standard

2691.98 --> 2698.279
approach that you tend to hear in

2695.249 --> 2702.3289999999997
certain type of groups do you know which

2698.279 --> 2706.499
groups I'm talking about I'll give you a

2702.329 --> 2711.7400000000002
hint they put their foot in the door hmm

2706.499 --> 2711.74
do you recognize do you recognize it

2715.67 --> 2718.699
[Music]

2720.319 --> 2727.16
yeah I would do that as well as their

2723.869 --> 2727.1600000000003
hairy Zack Holmes

2738.559 --> 2746.9900000000002
no Shawn Smith they're just deeply

2743.24 --> 2746.99
personally deluded

2755.84 --> 2760.52
and it's not a spontaneous delusion it's

2758.66 --> 2763.49
a delusion that's been handed to them by

2760.52 --> 2774.56
society and being perpetuated by that

2763.49 --> 2781.4599999999996
same society as it is good Ragnar Stefan

2774.56 --> 2785.63
Alderson that's good yeah I know you say

2781.46 --> 2788.9
a lot of things Pharaoh music ballers

2785.63 --> 2791.4700000000003
have said a lot of things and a huge

2788.9 --> 2795.77
preponderance of these things are

2791.47 --> 2801.2599999999998
literally broken visible within

2795.77 --> 2803.78
mid-sentence so yeah I don't know if

2801.26 --> 2807.3500000000004
usually when people will try to uphold

2803.78 --> 2810.02
the value in some moral way they try to

2807.35 --> 2812.7799999999997
compare the complete package of what

2810.02 --> 2814.85
people do in their interaction and if

2812.78 --> 2817.61
somebody says yeah I'm so moral and all

2814.85 --> 2820.21
that and so important but then in the

2817.61 --> 2825.38
open they're just literally caught

2820.21 --> 2830.69
maniacally lying maniacally openly

2825.38 --> 2834.13
provably lying persistently that tends

2830.69 --> 2838.9700000000003
to bring some trouble with that wait

2834.13 --> 2842.8
bring some doubts and now you can ignore

2838.97 --> 2846.89
that and say no didn't happen but

2842.8 --> 2848.51
everyone else will not unless well

2846.89 --> 2851.2
they're part of your religion and we'll

2848.51 --> 2851.2000000000003
do it the same way

2856.609 --> 2862.91
what lies are you talking about well how

2860.099 --> 2865.6800000000003
about just literally lying about

2862.91 --> 2867.359
mechanics and then saying no I didn't

2865.68 --> 2870.69
say that when you literally said that

2867.359 --> 2872.7
rembered the nice rumpus clip rumpus is

2870.69 --> 2874.8
not the only one that's done that it's

2872.7 --> 2876.72
just one of the most remarkable ones

2874.8 --> 2882.21
because it superseded each other so

2876.72 --> 2884.0699999999997
quickly but yeah if you contradict

2882.21 --> 2887.67
yourself in some way in some technical

2884.07 --> 2890.63
way like that and then when you are

2887.67 --> 2896.67
presented with that contradiction and

2890.63 --> 2901.5
you still double down that's when you

2896.67 --> 2906.17
become a maniacal liar and a lot of you

2901.5 --> 2906.17
have done that multiple occasions

2914.35 --> 2921.91
so yeah so really nice societal Worth

2918.23 --> 2925.64
moral value but yeah you're caught

2921.91 --> 2928.1499999999996
maniacally provably lying on multiple

2925.64 --> 2933.35
occasions and you still stick with it

2928.15 --> 2937.03
that takes a huge chunk out of the

2933.35 --> 2940.1
social moral wait you're trying to wield

2937.03 --> 2943.7900000000004
in the face of the rest of the world

2940.1 --> 2948.5899999999997
whether they agree with you or not just

2943.79 --> 2951.5299999999997
say I know you can ignore this but the

2948.59 --> 2954.4
rest of the people will not especially

2951.53 --> 2954.4
not in yet

2961.07 --> 2976.4900000000002
[Music]

2964.94 --> 2976.4900000000002
sighs you not bilgey if anything that

2978.2 --> 2987.81
it's more like a controlled psychosis it

2982.26 --> 2990.4700000000003
is it's controlled though it's very

2987.81 --> 2993.54
specific it's a dream presented as real

2990.47 --> 2996.0
doesn't make any sense but it's made to

2993.54 --> 2998.66
be believed anyway and pushed peer

2996.0 --> 3001.58
pressured and all that to be believed

2998.66 --> 3004.49
structures to distract you with and to

3001.58 --> 3010.0099999999998
reaffirm that belief not confirm it

3004.49 --> 3014.27
reaffirm it reaffirm the belief not the

3010.01 --> 3018.71
actual reality that's what it all is

3014.27 --> 3022.67
it's a controlled psychosis yeah you can

3018.71 --> 3026.3
spell it like that but it is controlled

3022.67 --> 3029.0
the mechanism is specific it's not a

3026.3 --> 3031.01
wild delusion even though that's kind of

3029.0 --> 3033.79
allowed they say like oh yeah

3031.01 --> 3036.8300000000004
anybody can do science oh you could just

3033.79 --> 3038.45
you can imagine all of that and who

3036.83 --> 3042.14
knows what they're gonna take with it

3038.45 --> 3044.7799999999997
but technically what should be accepted

3042.14 --> 3048.0499999999997
within the fantasy within the lusion

3044.78 --> 3049.7900000000004
within the cognitive dissonance process

3048.05 --> 3053.03
of actually believing that's real which

3049.79 --> 3056.96
is the psychosis factor it is the rules

3053.03 --> 3060.2000000000003
are defined it's not like one person

3056.96 --> 3061.9700000000003
will just say one thing it like a

3060.2 --> 3063.7999999999997
completely different type of fantasy

3061.97 --> 3065.5699999999997
than the other just completely different

3063.8 --> 3069.05
and that that will be accepted now there

3065.57 --> 3074.1200000000003
are defined parameters of the controlled

3069.05 --> 3077.8
psychosis but only in its framework only

3074.12 --> 3082.79
in the structures of the delusion not

3077.8 --> 3086.0600000000004
necessarily within the imaginings that

3082.79 --> 3088.19
come with them that in which they are

3086.06 --> 3090.83
founded on which they arrest on the

3088.19 --> 3096.28
imagination skills and just how that

3090.83 --> 3096.2799999999997
works how it fits in into the human side

3100.15 --> 3103.2290000000003
[Music]

3103.749 --> 3106.749
yeah

3107.81 --> 3114.56
yeah I already did that psychosis is

3112.13 --> 3117.5
losing track basically of what is real

3114.56 --> 3119.63
and what is imagined and you have

3117.5 --> 3122.0
different layers within that can get

3119.63 --> 3125.54
fundamental and then you literally will

3122.0 --> 3127.7
confuse everything it will all just

3125.54 --> 3129.62
jumbled up like being in a mixer and

3127.7 --> 3131.75
then yeah you made yeah you can't even

3129.62 --> 3134.63
understand words and it can be very

3131.75 --> 3139.58
extreme but in the imagination yeah you

3134.63 --> 3142.01
can like dreams even they're pretty

3139.58 --> 3145.22
vivid and that's part of imagination

3142.01 --> 3149.5400000000004
skill and it utilizes that it utilizes

3145.22 --> 3153.5899999999997
the ability for you to believe things

3149.54 --> 3163.15
that are illogical it rests on that it

3153.59 --> 3165.17
demands that indoctrinated induced

3163.15 --> 3168.17
indoctrination induced I would call it

3165.17 --> 3171.17
but yeah yeah that's not too far off it

3168.17 --> 3174.9500000000003
is kind of like indoctrination induced

3171.17 --> 3177.11
Stockholm psychosis yeah in a bit it's

3174.95 --> 3180.29
been of an overgeneralization emphasis

3177.11 --> 3184.4
on the wrong core aspect but yeah that's

3180.29 --> 3186.95
what it comes down to ah there was a

3184.4 --> 3190.06
lovely hang out so many triggering

3186.95 --> 3190.06
[Music]

3194.329 --> 3202.549
now I would say that I didn't mean to

3197.329 --> 3205.309
but I actually did although it wasn't my

3202.549 --> 3211.089
primary objective my primary objective

3205.309 --> 3217.0690000000004
is to put out truth as honest as I can

3211.089 --> 3220.699
try to bring a structure more routed in

3217.069 --> 3221.42
actual reality and yeah I think it went

3220.699 --> 3223.239
pretty well

3221.42 --> 3226.219
triggered so many people out there

3223.239 --> 3228.079
they're all defined it like oh can you

3226.219 --> 3231.2490000000003
define this define that's always the

3228.079 --> 3234.1400000000003
solution isn't it it's like oh oh

3231.249 --> 3236.2389999999996
according to this person my religion has

3234.14 --> 3239.089
