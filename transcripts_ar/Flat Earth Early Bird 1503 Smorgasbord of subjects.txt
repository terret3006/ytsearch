86.88 --> 90.72
weather today is something different

89.28 --> 93.72
it's

90.72 --> 96.42
it's been kind of sunny but also clouds

93.72 --> 99.979
rushing by up there

96.42 --> 99.979
and it's very windy

100.259 --> 104.84
not like storm level but still

105.24 --> 110.6
sometimes a couple of gusts of wind pass

108.6 --> 114.29899999999999
by here

110.6 --> 118.579
and it's like sea goes constantly flying

114.299 --> 118.57900000000001
around in in giant flocks

120.54 --> 125.96000000000001
yeah like just playing around up there

127.78 --> 131.76
[Music]

130.2 --> 134.879
all right so it's

131.76 --> 137.28
it's a very strange day it feels

134.879 --> 139.44
potentially it's a bit Restless because

137.28 --> 142.16
of all the wind

139.44 --> 142.16
ah

144.0 --> 149.66
all right hello LSG first in chat good

147.239 --> 149.66
to see you

151.319 --> 158.39999999999998
it is Sunday the 5th of February 2023

158.94 --> 165.63
it yeah it feels pretty nice actually

161.459 --> 167.64000000000001
outside so it's probably not cold

165.63 --> 171.5
[Applause]

167.64 --> 171.5
nine degrees Celsius right

180.3 --> 182.959
all right

183.47 --> 186.669
[Music]

187.7 --> 191.23899999999998
tomorrow's my birthday

191.7 --> 196.879
and as you guessed I don't have anything

193.86 --> 196.87900000000002
special planned

197.459 --> 201.20000000000002
except for well just

201.84 --> 210.84
array I'll be 43. I've been feeling 43

206.159 --> 212.94
all all along because for me

210.84 --> 215.879
well then the digit

212.94 --> 218.4
the last digit to me is directly linked

215.879 --> 222.239
to the year it is so it's like yeah I

218.4 --> 223.68
get used to basically being that other

222.239 --> 227.04
digit

223.68 --> 228.72
a month and six days ahead of time and

227.04 --> 229.85999999999999
that's what it really feels like to me

228.72 --> 233.58
so

229.86 --> 235.799
I've never had real trouble adapting to

233.58 --> 238.37900000000002
my new age

235.799 --> 241.64000000000001
it's more like whoa the new year that's

238.379 --> 241.64
always been more of a shock

242.42 --> 248.48
it's like the preliminary birthday

244.98 --> 248.48
warning anyway

249.739 --> 254.78
how are you doing

251.64 --> 254.77999999999997
thanks for watching

256.079 --> 260.6
feeling pretty good I had a pretty good

258.299 --> 260.59999999999997
rest

263.94 --> 270.0
watched a movie also

267.24 --> 274.46000000000004
pretty intense

270.0 --> 274.46
uh when I get to that maybe

277.38 --> 282.71999999999997
was called eye for an eye but it was

280.44 --> 285.62
it was risky

282.72 --> 285.62
it was like

286.199 --> 291.90000000000003
it's like I'm not sure like if that's

288.72 --> 294.06
morally right or not but it yeah it's

291.9 --> 295.5
like on that ground

294.06 --> 296.88
where it's

295.5 --> 299.82
I mean

296.88 --> 302.419
the villain in this one was like really

299.82 --> 302.419
[ __ ] up

303.54 --> 310.1
the actor did an amazing like that was

306.479 --> 310.09999999999997
genuinely a scary guy

310.139 --> 313.62
to me

312.0 --> 316.32
ah

313.62 --> 318.9
anyway I watched that number six

316.32 --> 320.76
strapped for ah [ __ ]

318.9 --> 324.41999999999996
colloidal silver didn't work

320.76 --> 324.42
[Music]

324.78 --> 327.5
hmm

333.84 --> 339.539
they're probably got caught the same

335.58 --> 341.46
thing as oh Benjamin did like

339.539 --> 343.38
half a week ago

341.46 --> 345.18
I think it's going around in like places

343.38 --> 348.38
that have been really cold

345.18 --> 348.38
in the United States

350.58 --> 354.139
how close are you to Idaho

358.919 --> 363.25899999999996
anyway

360.72 --> 363.259
yeah

365.46 --> 370.44
I take it you got everything you need to

368.52 --> 373.139
get through that

370.44 --> 377.1
you know what to do

373.139 --> 378.84000000000003
if you if you want some tips just well I

377.1 --> 380.03900000000004
probably a whole bunch of people will

378.84 --> 382.75899999999996
pipe up

380.039 --> 382.759
for that

384.78 --> 391.34
I mean probably herbal tea with honey or

387.84 --> 391.34
something would be great

393.919 --> 398.78
and yeah try not to cough

400.62 --> 403.4
if you can

406.44 --> 410.12
other side of the country oh okay

412.68 --> 419.72
well maybe that's why if I mean it's

417.12 --> 419.72
I

420.5 --> 426.18
it doesn't necessarily have to matter if

423.3 --> 428.46000000000004
it's on the other side of the country

426.18 --> 430.62
because I think that these things also

428.46 --> 433.19899999999996
kind of go around psychosomatically but

430.62 --> 435.66
also based just on the conditions and

433.199 --> 438.479
United States has had a really cold

435.66 --> 441.0
winter a well maybe not for United

438.479 --> 443.65999999999997
States standards but I mean much colder

441.0 --> 443.66
than over here

443.88 --> 447.71999999999997
I'm not seeing a lot of people coughing

446.039 --> 451.639
out here

447.72 --> 451.639
because the Winter's been pretty mild

456.479 --> 461.38
hey mandyung see you what am I doing for

459.72 --> 462.72
my birthday

461.38 --> 465.8
[Music]

462.72 --> 465.8
nothing special

466.139 --> 472.139
I I kind of gave up I mean if I'd have

470.039 --> 475.139
like a typical friend Circle or

472.139 --> 478.88
something out here then I do something

475.139 --> 478.88
with a birthday but yeah

481.919 --> 487.31899999999996
I yeah don't exactly have money to do

485.039 --> 489.18
anything special either and and neither

487.319 --> 490.97900000000004
do I like want a cake or something

489.18 --> 493.699
because that's just gonna be sugar it's

490.979 --> 493.699
not good for me

496.139 --> 500.759
I don't Maybe

498.539 --> 502.62
if I get enough donations or something

500.759 --> 505.08000000000004
maybe I'll get like steak or something

502.62 --> 507.9
for a change

505.08 --> 510.599
that would be nice

507.9 --> 512.72
but I don't know

510.599 --> 512.72
okay

522.539 --> 526.64
I'm doing fine anyway

531.42 --> 535.0999999999999
yeah plenty of streams yesterday

538.68 --> 545.5799999999999
starting with flat sword

542.16 --> 548.04
about set balloons

545.58 --> 550.5600000000001
so that was just the theme of the show

548.04 --> 553.26
and yeah it was

550.56 --> 556.1999999999999
a typical flat torch I mean flat sword

553.26 --> 558.959
just has its his thing that he's doing

556.2 --> 560.76
it's pretty entertaining I mean pretty

558.959 --> 562.56
generalized

560.76 --> 567.56
[Music]

562.56 --> 567.56
but I mean it feels kind of good huh

567.6 --> 572.7
also the Han experience and he's he just

570.899 --> 575.04
popped up with something

572.7 --> 578.22
what is that

575.04 --> 581.8389999999999
let me check that out

578.22 --> 581.839
no that's not what I wanted

582.36 --> 585.9590000000001
oh he does little announcement videos I

584.76 --> 589.8199999999999
think

585.959 --> 589.8199999999999
well I'm gonna do a stream then

591.36 --> 596.0
seems to be doing that

593.399 --> 596.0
uh

596.64 --> 600.36
but I mean I've been kind of enjoying

598.8 --> 602.399
his streams too

600.36 --> 604.44
it's something else but it's just kind

602.399 --> 606.959
of interesting to hear it all in Dutch

604.44 --> 610.019
or well not at all because

606.959 --> 611.459
the argumentation isn't exactly state of

610.019 --> 613.38
the art

611.459 --> 616.5799999999999
but

613.38 --> 616.58
decent enough

619.08 --> 625.76
to be bearable I mean it's not just a

622.2 --> 625.76
bunch of weird nonsense or something

627.0 --> 631.56
uh

629.399 --> 634.04
so yeah that's been interesting

631.56 --> 637.1999999999999
oh yeah QE

634.04 --> 639.54
oh that was so hilarious

637.2 --> 642.44
yeah he's done another treatment instead

639.54 --> 642.4399999999999
of a ball busters

642.959 --> 649.5
going after Dave again it's just like

646.8 --> 651.66
endless amount endless amount of

649.5 --> 654.48
comments on just

651.66 --> 658.76
just one little sent like that video was

654.48 --> 658.76
terrible I mean terrible

659.459 --> 664.6999999999999
that kiwi was reviewing

662.16 --> 664.6999999999999
so

664.86 --> 671.16
but yeah it's very entertaining

668.22 --> 673.399
I think I like it when kiwi does that

671.16 --> 677.64
does the grilling

673.399 --> 679.92
because it's just hysterical

677.64 --> 682.86
and he's really infectious with this

679.92 --> 685.86
where do you go where he just he just

682.86 --> 688.98
goes like a bell doing and it just

685.86 --> 691.6800000000001
resonates and everybody gets all excited

688.98 --> 694.5790000000001
from that it's just it's fun I like it

691.68 --> 694.579
when he does those videos

703.86 --> 709.62
right so and and then yeah after that

707.1 --> 712.32
also been playing I've been playing some

709.62 --> 714.18
more Baldur's Gate

712.32 --> 715.2600000000001
also

714.18 --> 717.959
and

715.26 --> 720.6
because yeah I'm not

717.959 --> 722.459
entirely done with that yet I mean I

720.6 --> 724.5600000000001
played the first round but there's like

722.459 --> 728.06
several things you can do in replays and

724.56 --> 728.06
all that and anyway

728.279 --> 731.779
and I still enjoyed the music

732.6 --> 737.76
I really kind of stopped playing it when

734.82 --> 741.38
I when I get sick of the music

737.76 --> 741.38
it's really funny how that works

743.7 --> 746.3000000000001
uh

748.8 --> 755.399
right and then I kind of rounded out the

751.5 --> 756.72
day with watching that film eye for an

755.399 --> 758.64
eye

756.72 --> 761.1800000000001
just kind of like

758.64 --> 761.18
well

762.18 --> 768.5999999999999
it's terrible it's like heavy tragedy in

765.3 --> 771.079
the sense but like with tragedy and

768.6 --> 771.0790000000001
vengeance

771.24 --> 777.0600000000001
but

772.76 --> 781.38
very subtle I mean the acting was

777.06 --> 781.38
like really convincing

784.38 --> 789.26
but yeah that's definitely not a family

786.66 --> 789.26
movie

789.72 --> 794.279
definitely not for children and watch

791.88 --> 797.3389999999999
it's horrific in that sense I mean it's

794.279 --> 799.019
basically just murder rape it's about a

797.339 --> 801.899
murder rapist pretty much but it's not

799.019 --> 804.9590000000001
about him it's about a victim of that

801.899 --> 807.72
and what what they do and like the

804.959 --> 809.6999999999999
Justice situation goes wrong because of

807.72 --> 813.12
stupid technicalities and then he's just

809.7 --> 815.4590000000001
free and the

813.12 --> 816.48
the mother basically goes insane over

815.459 --> 820.2199999999999
that

816.48 --> 820.22
starts to become obsessed

820.32 --> 825.36
and and then

822.72 --> 827.779
eventually starts to conspire to take

825.36 --> 827.779
him down

828.18 --> 833.0999999999999
but yeah

830.339 --> 835.44
like it ends up

833.1 --> 838.26
that the guy basically comes after her

835.44 --> 840.0600000000001
and then yeah now I'm spoiling it but I

838.26 --> 841.8199999999999
mean not a lot of you are probably gonna

840.06 --> 844.92
watch it

841.82 --> 847.9200000000001
it turns out all right but I mean it's

844.92 --> 850.1999999999999
all still kind of shady

847.92 --> 851.9399999999999
but it's yeah at the end I feel really

850.2 --> 856.1600000000001
like conflicted like at one side it's

851.94 --> 856.1600000000001
like yeah and then the other is like uh

858.3 --> 865.8199999999999
but that's kind of interesting it's just

862.139 --> 865.82
it's a very adult movie

868.56 --> 874.4399999999999
I think that if a teen watches it

871.68 --> 877.7399999999999
they wouldn't get it

874.44 --> 879.4200000000001
they wouldn't get the subtleties of it

877.74 --> 882.0600000000001
Maybe

879.42 --> 884.16
some of them maybe I'm projecting maybe

882.06 --> 885.8389999999999
I as a team wouldn't have gotten the

884.16 --> 888.959
movie

885.839 --> 892.0790000000001
maybe other teens would have

888.959 --> 895.079
but I certainly get it now anyway what a

892.079 --> 898.079
price for Adam what movie yeah I for an

895.079 --> 900.779
eye that I watched it on Netflix

898.079 --> 903.3
it's very hard to even find anything

900.779 --> 905.9399999999999
watchable on Netflix and this was like

903.3 --> 907.92
hmm

905.94 --> 911.36
some good actors

907.92 --> 911.36
this might be interesting

920.24 --> 925.86
right and it is also it's not like it

924.06 --> 928.0189999999999
all takes place in court or something

925.86 --> 930.9590000000001
it's not like that at all

928.019 --> 934.32
was it older yeah probably

930.959 --> 937.25
dude you could just look it up on IMDb

934.32 --> 940.2990000000001
I'll do that for you guys right now

937.25 --> 940.299
[Music]

944.69 --> 953.82
[Music]

951.0 --> 956.339
1996.

953.82 --> 960.9200000000001
yeah

956.339 --> 960.9200000000001
Sally Field and Kiefer Sutherland

968.459 --> 972.7399999999999
let's see what IMDb says about it

972.899 --> 976.68
yeah it's

974.699 --> 978.18
popularity

976.68 --> 981.2399999999999
not great

978.18 --> 983.04
IMDB ratings experiment whatever

981.24 --> 985.6800000000001
I thought it was a

983.04 --> 989.459
intense

985.68 --> 991.8
like very intense also just

989.459 --> 994.8
help like it was palpably scary you

991.8 --> 997.8599999999999
could really like feel the mother's

994.8 --> 1001.399
Terror in the moment as she was like

997.86 --> 1004.0
was just very intense like that

1001.399 --> 1004.0
anyway

1004.94 --> 1009.5
that's the one I was thinking of or

1007.04 --> 1011.86
Kiefer right yeah I watched that it was

1009.5 --> 1011.86
intense

1015.04 --> 1021.3199999999999
it was not like a moral booster or

1019.1 --> 1022.97
whatever but it was like

1021.32 --> 1026.299
it really did make you think

1022.97 --> 1029.299
[Music]

1026.299 --> 1031.939
and they had all kinds of components

1029.299 --> 1034.16
it's just it's a real awareness piece in

1031.939 --> 1036.8600000000001
many ways

1034.16 --> 1038.6000000000001
it really is about that I feel so I

1036.86 --> 1040.6989999999998
guess I thought it was a good movie

1038.6 --> 1042.9189999999999
it's just that

1040.699 --> 1047.0
it's kind of morally dubious in a way

1042.919 --> 1049.2800000000002
like and not like oh it's not glorifying

1047.0 --> 1051.919
criminality at all

1049.28 --> 1052.76
right because that is like ah the one of

1051.919 --> 1055.5400000000002
those

1052.76 --> 1058.599
no it's more subtle

1055.54 --> 1058.599
[Music]

1062.55 --> 1065.75
[Music]

1076.28 --> 1082.72
right but in a way the movie does kind

1079.22 --> 1082.72
of for some people probably

1084.02 --> 1088.28
that they might like really get into

1086.36 --> 1090.9799999999998
like the woman's role and just that

1088.28 --> 1094.3999999999999
Vengeance like because it's like very

1090.98 --> 1096.799
legitimate the way it's rolled out and

1094.4 --> 1099.3200000000002
the responses and this is like super

1096.799 --> 1101.72
horrific what happened and

1099.32 --> 1104.6599999999999
and she just can't let it go and that's

1101.72 --> 1106.82
a very normal typical response only a

1104.66 --> 1109.5800000000002
lot of people kind of go insane

1106.82 --> 1111.26
and she doesn't act she goes paranoia

1109.58 --> 1112.47
but she doesn't like lose her mind

1111.26 --> 1113.84
really

1112.47 --> 1116.0
[Music]

1113.84 --> 1118.24
it doesn't like start to hallucinate or

1116.0 --> 1118.24
something

1119.12 --> 1124.4599999999998
so it was just interesting

1122.419 --> 1125.7800000000002
psychologically

1124.46 --> 1129.58
yeah

1125.78 --> 1129.58
right so that happened

1138.5 --> 1142.52
but I mean there's like some crazy [ __ ]

1140.9 --> 1145.46
in there I mean in a way it was almost

1142.52 --> 1149.78
like a micro cosmology conspiracy theory

1145.46 --> 1152.059
set up because she literally just well

1149.78 --> 1154.1
as she was talking the guy and this is

1152.059 --> 1158.0
like really insane

1154.1 --> 1160.299
at first you're not 100 sure that it is

1158.0 --> 1160.299
him

1161.32 --> 1166.52
but then eventually like she starts

1163.88 --> 1168.74
stalking him and then

1166.52 --> 1170.48
who tries to that I'm completely

1168.74 --> 1172.52
spoiling the movie at this point I am

1170.48 --> 1177.88
sorry but I I really kind of got to talk

1172.52 --> 1177.8799999999999
about it and it's 96 anyway right

1178.34 --> 1184.1
but she tries to warn this woman that

1181.52 --> 1187.1
she thinks the guy is gonna rape and

1184.1 --> 1190.82
they all just like oh get out of here

1187.1 --> 1192.86
and then later he actually does that and

1190.82 --> 1196.58
kills her

1192.86 --> 1199.1599999999999
and then gets away with it again it's

1196.58 --> 1202.3999999999999
like what the [ __ ]

1199.16 --> 1204.5
I mean that's really it that is like

1202.4 --> 1209.38
what

1204.5 --> 1209.38
holy [ __ ] that is like some serious

1210.14 --> 1214.94
[ __ ]

1211.64 --> 1217.22
that they just shove in there like I

1214.94 --> 1219.0800000000002
wonder if if anything would if it could

1217.22 --> 1220.52
actually happen to that level I mean

1219.08 --> 1223.82
that is so

1220.52 --> 1226.82
that is so insane

1223.82 --> 1228.74
that like she'd literally warn the

1226.82 --> 1230.6
police about oh he's gonna rape that

1228.74 --> 1232.64
woman and them

1230.6 --> 1234.62
and they just tell her like no leave us

1232.64 --> 1237.3700000000001
alone and then it happens and then the

1234.62 --> 1240.4299999999998
guy still gets away with it it's like

1237.37 --> 1240.4299999999998
[Music]

1241.22 --> 1246.32
I thought like at some point halfway the

1244.46 --> 1249.28
movie I thought like is there some weird

1246.32 --> 1251.25
conspiracy is this guy some

1249.28 --> 1253.52
luciferian or something

1251.25 --> 1256.64
[Music]

1253.52 --> 1258.5
some Son of a politician

1256.64 --> 1260.24
that they just let get away with

1258.5 --> 1263.74
everything because

1260.24 --> 1263.74
like why the [ __ ]

1264.919 --> 1268.66
like how is this happening

1268.94 --> 1272.3200000000002
in that movie that is

1272.57 --> 1275.82
[Music]

1284.9 --> 1289.22
hello Kai from Gore

1288.02 --> 1292.22
if

1289.22 --> 1295.419
they made a true movie about me

1292.22 --> 1295.419
I have no idea

1297.26 --> 1302.45
who the hell would make a movie about me

1299.32 --> 1302.45
[Music]

1302.659 --> 1305.2600000000002
I mean

1306.679 --> 1312.5800000000002
overall is it really movie worthy my

1310.4 --> 1315.0800000000002
life I mean it's super

1312.58 --> 1316.9399999999998
monotonous that's not really movie

1315.08 --> 1319.34
Material it's not like I have exciting

1316.94 --> 1321.3200000000002
Adventures everywhere it's just what

1319.34 --> 1323.6
happens in my mind

1321.32 --> 1325.7
and I'm kind of good at translating it

1323.6 --> 1328.1
and working it out but that's not that's

1325.7 --> 1328.88
just this show it's what you interact

1328.1 --> 1330.799
with

1328.88 --> 1333.8600000000001
what you can learn I mean you can't

1330.799 --> 1338.1399999999999
really make a movie about that

1333.86 --> 1338.1399999999999
unless you draw in all kinds of nonsense

1340.46 --> 1345.98
or I mean I guess potentially somebody

1342.98 --> 1349.96
could make some kind of a stranger

1345.98 --> 1349.96
things Style movie about me

1350.24 --> 1356.24
going into the dark world and all that

1354.32 --> 1360.8799999999999
thank you

1356.24 --> 1360.88
but who would play that I have no idea

1368.179 --> 1373.5800000000002
and besides like even

1370.64 --> 1375.38
for my experience it was super

1373.58 --> 1376.76
heavy because while it's literally

1375.38 --> 1381.7990000000002
happened to me

1376.76 --> 1383.6589999999999
but like as a movie I don't know like

1381.799 --> 1385.4
I don't I think it would just be kind of

1383.659 --> 1387.5590000000002
weird and vague and people wouldn't get

1385.4 --> 1390.3400000000001
it

1387.559 --> 1390.34
foreign

1395.659 --> 1402.2800000000002
I mean I have trouble understanding it a

1398.0 --> 1402.28
lot about it is like a puzzle to me

1402.74 --> 1407.78
digging things back up and then just

1405.02 --> 1410.059
like identifying a situation versus what

1407.78 --> 1411.98
I know about the characters involved in

1410.059 --> 1414.86
that situation and what they stand for

1411.98 --> 1417.14
symbolically and sometimes it's

1414.86 --> 1420.559
literally a person

1417.14 --> 1423.0200000000002
that's like because I suspect that the

1420.559 --> 1425.48
black bearded man was actually at least

1423.02 --> 1427.76
started out as an as a real Outsider

1425.48 --> 1430.159
another person that basically entered

1427.76 --> 1432.559
that Dark World dream

1430.159 --> 1434.7800000000002
was invited

1432.559 --> 1437.4189999999999
in there

1434.78 --> 1441.62
somehow

1437.419 --> 1443.539
but that later on in the big vision

1441.62 --> 1446.12
because I even heard this from my healer

1443.539 --> 1448.46
that that guy actually died

1446.12 --> 1451.1589999999999
it was already dead for a while

1448.46 --> 1455.24
like the physical person

1451.159 --> 1456.8600000000001
not while that thing happened but after

1455.24 --> 1459.98
and that

1456.86 --> 1461.8999999999999
well all the Visions I've had since that

1459.98 --> 1465.02
moment have basically been my own

1461.9 --> 1468.3200000000002
construct me in a weird subconscious way

1465.02 --> 1469.46
longing for that influence because he

1468.32 --> 1472.8799999999999
did

1469.46 --> 1474.8600000000001
kind of point out like cold facts to me

1472.88 --> 1478.7
and [ __ ]

1474.86 --> 1481.1589999999999
wow I had like emotions go like I

1478.7 --> 1482.78
couldn't see I couldn't figure things

1481.159 --> 1484.64
out well

1482.78 --> 1486.98
while I was

1484.64 --> 1488.7800000000002
in the Dark World Vision

1486.98 --> 1491.02
that was like the [ __ ] up thing about

1488.78 --> 1491.02
it

1491.179 --> 1495.38
certain things I would just know and be

1494.24 --> 1498.08
able to do

1495.38 --> 1501.0200000000002
but like trying to derive information

1498.08 --> 1504.98
from what was actually happening

1501.02 --> 1507.34
was incredibly tough like impossible

1504.98 --> 1507.34
almost

1508.4 --> 1512.72
so I just had that imprint but I

1510.919 --> 1514.3400000000001
couldn't really figure anything out

1512.72 --> 1516.559
while it was happening

1514.34 --> 1519.26
or not I could figure out some things

1516.559 --> 1521.12
but it was like it just was fatigue I

1519.26 --> 1523.46
couldn't

1521.12 --> 1524.9599999999998
I could didn't have the strength to do

1523.46 --> 1528.08
that

1524.96 --> 1531.76
I could only basically Witness

1528.08 --> 1531.76
most things in there

1534.14 --> 1537.5
while that specific process was

1536.179 --> 1539.9
happening

1537.5 --> 1544.24
unlike regular dreams where I have like

1539.9 --> 1544.24
full range control over what's happening

1547.78 --> 1550.94
[Music]

1554.779 --> 1560.36
right

1555.919 --> 1563.24
so when they were actual people in there

1560.36 --> 1565.2199999999998
they had their own objectives and I

1563.24 --> 1567.38
could almost kind of mind read it off

1565.22 --> 1568.94
them or feel it off them I could feel

1567.38 --> 1571.64
their intent

1568.94 --> 1575.299
even from the black bearded man

1571.64 --> 1578.179
and at first it was extremely unpleasant

1575.299 --> 1580.22
like he obviously hated me and he said

1578.179 --> 1583.1000000000001
he was God

1580.22 --> 1585.14
but that was a lie could see it on him

1583.1 --> 1587.9599999999998
but still like I didn't know what the

1585.14 --> 1590.0
hell was going on so it was all really

1587.96 --> 1591.799
confusing to me

1590.0 --> 1594.159
it's like at the start of the whole

1591.799 --> 1594.1589999999999
process

1594.559 --> 1599.6589999999999
and he did teach me things

1597.02 --> 1602.0
in a way he brought Clarity because I

1599.659 --> 1604.72
didn't have much

1602.0 --> 1604.72
so

1604.88 --> 1611.24
and he would just kind of pop back into

1607.7 --> 1613.5800000000002
the picture doing big Vision experiences

1611.24 --> 1615.559
basically point out things or like

1613.58 --> 1617.1789999999999
declare things

1615.559 --> 1619.039
it's really weird

1617.179 --> 1621.5590000000002
but later

1619.039 --> 1624.86
he didn't really have much person that

1621.559 --> 1627.2
he was just pointing things out

1624.86 --> 1631.299
it was very serviceable but that's

1627.2 --> 1631.299
probably because he wasn't alive anymore

1632.36 --> 1639.08
and that was actually like a shadow

1635.24 --> 1642.26
that was now dormant not driven by

1639.08 --> 1646.22
another will but like a body inside of

1642.26 --> 1648.559
my spiritual body that

1646.22 --> 1650.26
kind of surrendered

1648.559 --> 1653.0
this is

1650.26 --> 1655.8799999999999
not that he would like do everything for

1653.0 --> 1658.96
me but he was basically he would

1655.88 --> 1658.96
give me information

1660.14 --> 1664.96
it's so weird it's so weird

1665.24 --> 1667.82
right

1666.679 --> 1669.679
but

1667.82 --> 1671.96
during a whole bunch of it I really

1669.679 --> 1675.5590000000002
thought that he was actually God and he

1671.96 --> 1678.44
was there to also punish me over things

1675.559 --> 1682.1589999999999
but I mean one point he pointed out like

1678.44 --> 1684.74
coffee it's gonna kill you

1682.159 --> 1687.6200000000001
that's so weird like I could literally

1684.74 --> 1688.88
see the Mirage of like the entire

1687.62 --> 1691.4599999999998
kitchen

1688.88 --> 1693.7990000000002
with the coffee pot and there were even

1691.46 --> 1696.14
people walking around and I would see

1693.799 --> 1697.52
him just standing there looking at me in

1696.14 --> 1698.659
the eyes and just

1697.52 --> 1700.46
like

1698.659 --> 1703.779
that's gonna kill you he didn't even say

1700.46 --> 1703.779
it but he I heard it

1705.799 --> 1709.039
that

1706.88 --> 1712.8200000000002
those kind of flashes

1709.039 --> 1716.12
so I even got to see like places

1712.82 --> 1717.86
earlier that I had never even been but I

1716.12 --> 1719.7199999999998
got to see so many of them that I

1717.86 --> 1721.6999999999998
couldn't place it anymore eventually so

1719.72 --> 1724.1000000000001
I got to that's the problem it's like a

1721.7 --> 1725.9
Cassandra effect thing because I got to

1724.1 --> 1728.299
see so many things that I would

1725.9 --> 1732.8200000000002
eventually get to know

1728.299 --> 1732.82
that I it was all too much for me

1734.299 --> 1739.1
and it's only now

1736.76 --> 1741.62
that well some of these events and

1739.1 --> 1744.3799999999999
places have actually come to pass for me

1741.62 --> 1747.3799999999999
to see you in the linear timeline that I

1744.38 --> 1749.72
really recognize what that was

1747.38 --> 1752.24
and that's really yeah how am I

1749.72 --> 1755.3600000000001
experiencing it now my memories of it

1752.24 --> 1758.26
the Dark Worlds

1755.36 --> 1758.26
visions

1760.1 --> 1763.5
hello Neil because Dino good to see you

1762.08 --> 1765.3799999999999
are you doing

1763.5 --> 1767.919
[Music]

1765.38 --> 1767.919
[ __ ]

1769.58 --> 1773.289
ing

1770.19 --> 1773.289
[Music]

1775.76 --> 1780.98
right but the thing is Kai from Gore I

1778.82 --> 1782.779
don't think if like a movie about me

1780.98 --> 1785.84
would be like oh

1782.779 --> 1788.36
so interesting but

1785.84 --> 1791.84
the processes that I'm describing about

1788.36 --> 1795.4399999999998
my Visions I could definitely like help

1791.84 --> 1796.82
a director to make it exactly like I

1795.44 --> 1800.3600000000001
experienced

1796.82 --> 1803.48
because there was a real key theme in my

1800.36 --> 1804.6789999999999
experiences as to light the light in

1803.48 --> 1808.179
there

1804.679 --> 1808.179
and this is the weird thing

1808.279 --> 1812.539
there were some things that I would be

1810.2 --> 1815.779
seeing

1812.539 --> 1817.7
like evil people that I didn't know

1815.779 --> 1819.44
really yet

1817.7 --> 1821.1200000000001
like I didn't recognize because now

1819.44 --> 1823.5800000000002
they've all been revealed kind of

1821.12 --> 1825.3799999999999
through media but they are evil people

1823.58 --> 1828.1999999999998
for sure

1825.38 --> 1829.5800000000002
and every time I would see moments of

1828.2 --> 1833.299
that

1829.58 --> 1835.34
everything would be super bright but not

1833.299 --> 1836.96
bright as an over lit it's like there's

1835.34 --> 1838.58
this

1836.96 --> 1842.059
energy

1838.58 --> 1843.62
it's like and the feeling of an angel of

1842.059 --> 1846.02
Light

1843.62 --> 1847.6999999999998
but treacherous I could feel that it is

1846.02 --> 1851.299
treacherous because I had the sense to

1847.7 --> 1854.1200000000001
feel that so it's almost like like well

1851.299 --> 1856.58
the angel of Light the evil one

1854.12 --> 1857.779
and that would be present there not some

1856.58 --> 1860.1789999999999
figure

1857.779 --> 1862.399
but just like they would have all that

1860.179 --> 1864.02
light surrounding them the evil ones

1862.399 --> 1866.12
would have all that light surrounding

1864.02 --> 1868.8799999999999
them in my Dark World Vision that's so

1866.12 --> 1871.34
weird and the people that weren't evil

1868.88 --> 1875.2990000000002
they seem kind of dimmed down and

1871.34 --> 1879.76
darkened it's so weird and like exactly

1875.299 --> 1879.76
the opposite of intuition in a way

1884.659 --> 1890.48
and very like it was painful

1888.2 --> 1892.3400000000001
to be around but but the thing is that

1890.48 --> 1895.94
in real life that hasn't that's the same

1892.34 --> 1899.08
except I don't see all that light stuff

1895.94 --> 1899.0800000000002
like I did in there

1899.179 --> 1904.76
maybe as a kid I actually did see evil

1902.72 --> 1907.34
people like that and it would be so

1904.76 --> 1909.98
curious as the what is that why

1907.34 --> 1913.279
why am I seeing all this like this weird

1909.98 --> 1914.98
contrast line and then just like this

1913.279 --> 1918.559
energy see almost like you're

1914.98 --> 1920.84
irradiating light what is that

1918.559 --> 1924.1399999999999
because I did see things like auras and

1920.84 --> 1927.62
but not like typical Aura oh a colorful

1924.14 --> 1930.679
Aura but colors but just like I had

1927.62 --> 1933.26
contrast things I when something is

1930.679 --> 1935.0590000000002
really standing out it literally starts

1933.26 --> 1938.24
standing out to me like I start to see

1935.059 --> 1942.62
like this weird cut out

1938.24 --> 1945.32
almost like a dimensional cut of things

1942.62 --> 1948.559
like it suddenly is cut out and like a

1945.32 --> 1951.6789999999999
3d effect happens like that is

1948.559 --> 1954.74
what I do see it like not auras but that

1951.679 --> 1957.3200000000002
that is what I see and it's very in your

1954.74 --> 1958.52
face to me

1957.32 --> 1963.02
anyway

1958.52 --> 1964.279
so our win Vision experience but also in

1963.02 --> 1966.62
the real world

1964.279 --> 1968.779
because what I just described that's

1966.62 --> 1971.62
what I kind of see in the real world was

1968.779 --> 1971.62
somebody is like

1974.36 --> 1979.82
as a bad intent and they're keeping it a

1977.539 --> 1982.1589999999999
secret they're there to do something bad

1979.82 --> 1986.539
I can see it

1982.159 --> 1989.419
I see like this weird contrast on them

1986.539 --> 1992.539
and I can like spot that out in even in

1989.419 --> 1994.64
a crowd unless they're all like tuned

1992.539 --> 1997.179
into specifically the group mind and

1994.64 --> 1997.179
then I can't

1997.7 --> 2001.8990000000001
but individuals that are not tapped into

1999.679 --> 2003.519
the group mind but have their own thing

2001.899 --> 2005.799
I can see that I think even police

2003.519 --> 2008.74
officers are trained to with that skill

2005.799 --> 2012.94
to see that some police officers

2008.74 --> 2017.34
well I have that ability I just never

2012.94 --> 2017.3400000000001
I do I I learned to use it myself

2022.539 --> 2026.799
you can just see it if you just see it

2025.539 --> 2029.86
like

2026.799 --> 2032.32
that person has

2029.86 --> 2036.059
is planning something

2032.32 --> 2036.059
they're up to something all right

2038.799 --> 2041.5
and it's kind of funny because in the

2040.72 --> 2044.14
past

2041.5 --> 2046.96
I would activate graveler-ish although

2044.14 --> 2049.06
mostly more low-key oriented I'd never

2046.96 --> 2050.56
really wanted to really harm people but

2049.06 --> 2053.98
I did like scaring the [ __ ] out of

2050.56 --> 2056.919
people sometimes and creeping people out

2053.98 --> 2059.28
especially if I thought they were like

2056.919 --> 2059.2799999999997
like

2060.22 --> 2065.2
tied as

2062.379 --> 2068.58
bad Christians

2065.2 --> 2068.58
because I really hated those

2069.099 --> 2074.9190000000003
and I would like to scare them right but

2071.139 --> 2077.679
sometimes people would just see it on me

2074.919 --> 2079.6589999999997
like I I'm up to no good not that I

2077.679 --> 2081.46
would be doing something really evil but

2079.659 --> 2084.28
like that I was just they could just see

2081.46 --> 2087.54
it on me it's like I don't like the look

2084.28 --> 2087.5400000000004
on your face like what

2089.26 --> 2096.5400000000004
it's weird people can just see some

2092.44 --> 2096.54
people can just see intent

2102.82 --> 2106.38
and it's kind of weird because

2105.099 --> 2109.2400000000002
well

2106.38 --> 2110.44
in the past I knew a guy I called the

2109.24 --> 2112.06
Jesuit guy

2110.44 --> 2114.64
and he

2112.06 --> 2120.2799999999997
it's a psychopath all right

2114.64 --> 2124.2999999999997
I think even admittedly from himself but

2120.28 --> 2127.0
had a lot of control over it by the way

2124.3 --> 2129.099
but he would have like nasty moods too

2127.0 --> 2131.98
and I could literally just see it often

2129.099 --> 2133.96
even though he would have is like a very

2131.98 --> 2135.7
stoic fate like he would never show

2133.96 --> 2137.7400000000002
emotions

2135.7 --> 2140.3799999999997
but I could still see it on him and he

2137.74 --> 2142.1189999999997
really like unnerved him sometimes that

2140.38 --> 2145.54
I could literally just see it even

2142.119 --> 2148.1800000000003
though I could see the moment like a bad

2145.54 --> 2150.7599999999998
idea popped in his head

2148.18 --> 2152.9199999999996
literally I could as I was just talking

2150.76 --> 2155.7000000000003
I could literally see it happening and

2152.92 --> 2155.7000000000003
then I said it

2157.54 --> 2162.24
even though he wouldn't change his face

2163.9 --> 2166.079
right

2170.98 --> 2173.339
anyway

2179.38 --> 2183.3
I just I've always found people

2181.359 --> 2187.14
fascinating

2183.3 --> 2187.1400000000003
especially the weird ones

2197.56 --> 2203.119
right anyway

2199.9 --> 2203.119
[Music]

2204.28 --> 2207.6600000000003
done talking about this

2215.56 --> 2218.68
wait I thought yesterday's show was

2217.42 --> 2220.9
pretty good

2218.68 --> 2223.839
except for the moment where I got really

2220.9 --> 2225.7000000000003
disappointed and a bit grouchy

2223.839 --> 2227.68
other than that

2225.7 --> 2230.02
was pretty entertaining

2227.68 --> 2232.54
lots of new people came in

2230.02 --> 2234.52
and there were just no trolls that was

2232.54 --> 2236.68
weird and what happened to all the

2234.52 --> 2238.96
trolls it's like

2236.68 --> 2241.24
seem to have kind of gone

2238.96 --> 2243.16
and now they are only those trolls pop

2241.24 --> 2245.3999999999996
up when I get really angry for some

2243.16 --> 2245.3999999999996
reason

2256.9 --> 2263.619
I wonder if some of these troll people

2259.18 --> 2265.18
are just little demons that people don't

2263.619 --> 2268.359
know what they're doing and they just

2265.18 --> 2271.0
every time they feel a certain energy

2268.359 --> 2273.8199999999997
like anger or something they just

2271.0 --> 2276.339
they just like moths to a flame they

2273.82 --> 2278.32
just fly towards it and they don't even

2276.339 --> 2280.2999999999997
know what they're doing

2278.32 --> 2282.28
it's really what it feels like with some

2280.3 --> 2284.32
of these trolls that come back

2282.28 --> 2286.92
periodically

2284.32 --> 2288.82
especially that stupid message

2286.92 --> 2291.28
retracting troll

2288.82 --> 2294.06
which I'm pretty sure is one person who

2291.28 --> 2294.0600000000004
always does that

2296.079 --> 2305.94
yes like the most ninning remarks ever

2300.579 --> 2305.94
such like some wussy really annoying

2306.28 --> 2311.2000000000003
right but he's not here right now so

2308.8 --> 2314.98
it's a pretty nice day oh look the sun

2311.2 --> 2314.98
came out hmm

2315.46 --> 2318.0
foreign

2321.18 --> 2324.8999999999996
up the place a bit

2330.04 --> 2335.68
because some yeah at some point it's

2332.5 --> 2338.5
really weird I just kind of when things

2335.68 --> 2341.02
like get dirty but really slowly over

2338.5 --> 2343.9
time I just don't see it anymore until

2341.02 --> 2345.7
like a certain point

2343.9 --> 2348.099
like when the sun suddenly like really

2345.7 --> 2350.2599999999998
shines bright and then I really see it

2348.099 --> 2353.02
and so like ah man

2350.26 --> 2355.78
I'm gonna clean this up now so I spent

2353.02 --> 2356.74
like roughly an hour today cleaning that

2355.78 --> 2359.32
up

2356.74 --> 2362.22
and now it's so fresh

2359.32 --> 2362.2200000000003
and new looking

2368.28 --> 2374.1400000000003
at flat so it's comments I tend to

2371.68 --> 2377.3199999999997
accept demons into Theory

2374.14 --> 2381.7599999999998
well demons is in this sense a

2377.32 --> 2384.88
psychological phenomenon right demons

2381.76 --> 2388.48
it's just they take hold of you and then

2384.88 --> 2390.1600000000003
you just start to behave like that

2388.48 --> 2392.2
but the person you don't know anything

2390.16 --> 2394.839
about the person just because of that

2392.2 --> 2397.7799999999997
it's just like this thing they

2394.839 --> 2400.9
neurotic thing they do

2397.78 --> 2402.76
when even that those people can even be

2400.9 --> 2405.28
like relatively

2402.76 --> 2407.94
wealthy businessmen or anything you

2405.28 --> 2407.94
don't really know

2411.52 --> 2417.94
maybe they are people that are actually

2413.74 --> 2420.5789999999997
just all day long being really nice to

2417.94 --> 2421.9
people that don't really deserve it

2420.579 --> 2424.5
right

2421.9 --> 2426.94
and they just need to go

2424.5 --> 2428.56
and they're looking out for Flat Earth

2426.94 --> 2430.48
or specifically to do that because

2428.56 --> 2432.9
there's the least amount of chance that

2430.48 --> 2432.9
that will

2433.78 --> 2440.02
be sought out

2435.94 --> 2442.68
by those people so right it might be

2440.02 --> 2442.68
that as well

2443.68 --> 2446.3999999999996
who knows

2452.74 --> 2457.2599999999998
if all the things for your rage about

2454.599 --> 2457.26
automatically

2457.66 --> 2463.72
well no but you have everybody has

2460.3 --> 2465.7200000000003
Tendencies I guess if you have it's if

2463.72 --> 2468.52
you even have that

2465.72 --> 2470.9199999999996
impulse of Rage some people don't get

2468.52 --> 2473.2599999999998
that kid just don't get angry

2470.92 --> 2475.3
or they've decided at some point to get

2473.26 --> 2478.42
buddhistic about it and literally just

2475.3 --> 2481.92
not be angry over anything

2478.42 --> 2481.92
they are out there

2484.24 --> 2489.4599999999996
my dad is kind of like that he's like

2486.76 --> 2491.98
really he doesn't get angry anymore but

2489.46 --> 2493.9
it's also because every time he's gotten

2491.98 --> 2496.42
angry in his life pretty much think just

2493.9 --> 2498.52
go wrong so it's never been something

2496.42 --> 2500.92
that he's been able to

2498.52 --> 2504.339
figure out how to do something with it

2500.92 --> 2506.92
constructively unlike me which I really

2504.339 --> 2509.02
have like actively

2506.92 --> 2510.64
tried to tame it

2509.02 --> 2513.52
in ways

2510.64 --> 2516.48
I can I can do things with it he's never

2513.52 --> 2516.48
been able to do that

2516.88 --> 2524.04
so he kind of swore it off and so he

2519.16 --> 2524.04
just he might get excited about things

2524.14 --> 2529.54
or even like he still has grief and all

2526.9 --> 2532.44
those things but he just doesn't get

2529.54 --> 2532.44
angry

2534.88 --> 2541.1800000000003
it's just my crippling race issues this

2537.4 --> 2543.46
is really that bad

2541.18 --> 2546.72
not sure if I'm welcome back why

2543.46 --> 2546.7200000000003
wouldn't you be steamy Traveler

2551.079 --> 2556.3
of course you're welcome back

2552.88 --> 2558.2200000000003
I mean yesterday was just

2556.3 --> 2561.28
you just went down the wrong lane but

2558.22 --> 2565.4399999999996
you had good intentions and

2561.28 --> 2565.44
it went wrong and that's fine

2565.839 --> 2570.7
why the hell would I punish you for that

2567.88 --> 2573.04
you were literally trying to

2570.7 --> 2576.54
like calm the situation the problem is

2573.04 --> 2576.54
is that that doesn't really work

2577.18 --> 2582.7599999999998
I mean that that works if I am literally

2580.0 --> 2584.859
in grief right

2582.76 --> 2588.9
but I wasn't I was just really

2584.859 --> 2588.9
disappointed not in grief

2589.78 --> 2594.0400000000004
it was just this because I had kind of

2592.24 --> 2596.319
like really

2594.04 --> 2598.839
dreamed about it and like I was really

2596.319 --> 2600.64
looking forward to exactly the way I saw

2598.839 --> 2602.819
it in my head that happens to me

2600.64 --> 2605.98
sometimes it's part of a creative mood

2602.819 --> 2608.38
actually which is a good sign

2605.98 --> 2611.4
although yeah it works better when you

2608.38 --> 2611.4
personally do it

2615.819 --> 2620.68
so I was just I had blown it up a bit

2618.339 --> 2624.359
with too much energy and then I was

2620.68 --> 2624.359
really disappointed so I got it

2624.94 --> 2631.619
and when somebody does that you don't

2627.76 --> 2631.619
tell them to oh calm down

2632.04 --> 2636.599
right in general that doesn't really

2634.359 --> 2636.5989999999997
work

2647.98 --> 2653.8
or maybe it just doesn't work with me I

2651.099 --> 2656.38
I get really annoyed it's with me when I

2653.8 --> 2658.3
go like that I the only way to fix it is

2656.38 --> 2660.94
to just let it out

2658.3 --> 2663.1600000000003
not to Target anybody but to just let it

2660.94 --> 2665.56
out but if somebody then tries to Halt

2663.16 --> 2668.02
that process it's like you're trying to

2665.56 --> 2671.0789999999997
disrupt me I just need to let it out so

2668.02 --> 2674.14
I can restore back to normal again

2671.079 --> 2676.1800000000003
right because I do strive I'm not

2674.14 --> 2679.1189999999997
because I'm not a person that is going

2676.18 --> 2681.8799999999997
to hold on to that and whine on and on

2679.119 --> 2683.98
and on for hours right I'm not like that

2681.88 --> 2688.5
I just gotta get it out of my system

2683.98 --> 2688.5
because I I don't want to be agitated

2690.22 --> 2693.9399999999996
right I mean that's how I've acted here

2692.56 --> 2695.44
on the show

2693.94 --> 2699.78
always

2695.44 --> 2699.78
I'm pretty consistent in how I function

2701.02 --> 2705.18
I think

2702.579 --> 2705.1800000000003
right

2706.96 --> 2711.64
and then when I'm doing really bad I

2709.24 --> 2714.16
have much less control and less

2711.64 --> 2716.859
grip on what I'm doing and then when I'm

2714.16 --> 2718.7799999999997
doing much better I have more grip and

2716.859 --> 2720.7
then I'll be more subtle

2718.78 --> 2722.7400000000002
and more dynamic

2720.7 --> 2724.96
and less agitated

2722.74 --> 2726.8799999999997
and this is just yeah between that and

2724.96 --> 2728.619
I'm doing really good right now I've

2726.88 --> 2730.38
been doing pretty good since I stopped

2728.619 --> 2733.7200000000003
drinking overall

2730.38 --> 2735.7000000000003
that's a real big difference

2733.72 --> 2738.339
it's funny because yesterday I was even

2735.7 --> 2741.8799999999997
a bit tempted like shall I take that one

2738.339 --> 2744.7599999999998
beer should I do it like once a week

2741.88 --> 2746.2000000000003
that's all like

2744.76 --> 2749.8
nah

2746.2 --> 2752.7
I'm just not gonna do it at all

2749.8 --> 2752.7000000000003
see what happens

2753.85 --> 2756.98
[Music]

2757.54 --> 2763.0
it's kind of funny because people have

2759.339 --> 2766.96
been telling me like wow that's amazing

2763.0 --> 2770.619
and I'm like yeah but it's not really to

2766.96 --> 2773.02
me that amazing it's just that

2770.619 --> 2775.359
it doesn't seem to be all that difficult

2773.02 --> 2778.38
it's like the right time for it and I'm

2775.359 --> 2778.38
taking that opportunity

2778.839 --> 2783.46
it's not like oh I have to stop but I

2781.18 --> 2788.819
won't I don't want to stop no no it's

2783.46 --> 2788.819
like no I'm kind of done it just

2788.98 --> 2794.079
and I should be glad it's like oh I

2790.839 --> 2797.64
don't really feel addicted to it so

2794.079 --> 2797.6400000000003
why would I continue then

2797.92 --> 2802.5
since it's better like this

2799.9 --> 2802.5
yeah

2805.48 --> 2811.9
I mean even QE gave me a compliment

2807.94 --> 2815.14
about it like in the in the yeah

2811.9 --> 2818.52
non-recorded after show so

2815.14 --> 2818.52
I'm like yeah

2822.339 --> 2827.0789999999997
besides it's not a lot of time to party

2824.619 --> 2829.0
out there right now

2827.079 --> 2830.38
things are pretty

2829.0 --> 2832.5
tense

2830.38 --> 2832.5
okay

2835.9 --> 2841.2400000000002
I feel like I gotta stay sharp more

2839.079 --> 2843.2200000000003
and in that sense I'm even like thinking

2841.24 --> 2845.3799999999997
about

2843.22 --> 2847.4199999999996
like how am I gonna deal with this

2845.38 --> 2850.7200000000003
cannabis that I'm still doing and the

2847.42 --> 2852.88
tobacco like could I

2850.72 --> 2855.1189999999997
start turning that back what would

2852.88 --> 2855.119
happen

2857.26 --> 2862.5600000000004
I mean I've quit that before but that

2859.359 --> 2862.56
was really tough on me

2865.119 --> 2870.3
maybe it would work better

2867.28 --> 2870.3
I'm not sure

2872.5 --> 2877.839
anyway

2874.9 --> 2880.599
I'm doing good

2877.839 --> 2882.04
I'm eating yeah that's the thing I

2880.599 --> 2884.38
thought that I would eat a lot more

2882.04 --> 2886.48
because I didn't drink anymore that's

2884.38 --> 2889.079
the weird thing that actually turned out

2886.48 --> 2889.079
to be wrong

2889.72 --> 2893.319
I'm eating pretty much the same amount

2891.819 --> 2897.099
with not

2893.319 --> 2898.9
really a lot sometimes just like oh like

2897.099 --> 2900.94
french fries

2898.9 --> 2902.38
with some Satay and mayonnaise and

2900.94 --> 2905.68
onions and

2902.38 --> 2908.52
and an egg as lunch

2905.68 --> 2908.52
and that's it

2909.28 --> 2915.52
and I don't even like oh damn it oh I

2911.92 --> 2919.2400000000002
feel hungry no less I feel less hungry

2915.52 --> 2920.92
with that like I did when I was drinking

2919.24 --> 2923.5789999999997
like oh

2920.92 --> 2923.579
okay

2927.339 --> 2932.319
is quitting all together best or

2930.4 --> 2935.88
quitting with what

2932.319 --> 2935.88
alcohol or cannabis

2941.14 --> 2948.7599999999998
and really all depends on the person and

2945.52 --> 2951.52
how addicted they are to it and also

2948.76 --> 2955.26
like what form is the addiction

2951.52 --> 2955.2599999999998
expression actually taking

2955.3 --> 2961.119
so some alcoholics are like really

2958.42 --> 2962.92
dangerously alcoholic and like they can

2961.119 --> 2965.56
never touch it they have to go cold

2962.92 --> 2967.48
turkey because they literally just turn

2965.56 --> 2968.7999999999997
into a monster the second they touch it

2967.48 --> 2970.72
again

2968.8 --> 2973.3
right

2970.72 --> 2975.2799999999997
but others it's like no I would just

2973.3 --> 2977.8
drink too much because I'm I'm getting

2975.28 --> 2979.96
kind of fat right that's it that's their

2977.8 --> 2982.0600000000004
problem with it and they have no real

2979.96 --> 2984.16
psychological issues with it really

2982.06 --> 2986.2
other than just a habit and they want to

2984.16 --> 2988.54
drink with the friends and right and

2986.2 --> 2991.359
they get a little fat right that's their

2988.54 --> 2993.22
level of it it's more habit-based

2991.359 --> 2995.56
it's very different

2993.22 --> 2998.2599999999998
sometimes that can be even tougher

2995.56 --> 3001.2599999999998
because if you want to quit drinking but

2998.26 --> 3003.48
your bodies don't then you're kind of

3001.26 --> 3005.7000000000003
breaking up with them in a way almost or

3003.48 --> 3007.56
they could be like that or it could just

3005.7 --> 3009.359
make it really difficult on you being

3007.56 --> 3010.98
them with them and the changes the

3009.359 --> 3012.24
chemistry

3010.98 --> 3015.9
right

3012.24 --> 3018.5989999999997
so it all depends on how somebody is

3015.9 --> 3019.6800000000003
addicted and how the addiction expresses

3018.599 --> 3022.319
itself

3019.68 --> 3025.319
within their life

3022.319 --> 3029.119
and with cannabis it's

3025.319 --> 3029.119
I'd say more complicated

3029.579 --> 3035.599
for me quitting cannabis

3032.339 --> 3035.599
was just cold turkey

3035.819 --> 3041.099
when I first did that it's just like

3038.28 --> 3043.38
okay I'm just done

3041.099 --> 3047.7000000000003
it's the funny thing because I even had

3043.38 --> 3050.52
like a really big bag from a harvest

3047.7 --> 3052.2
still left and I kept it around for like

3050.52 --> 3054.98
was it

3052.2 --> 3054.98
five years

3055.2 --> 3060.7799999999997
and then I started smoking that when I

3057.18 --> 3064.3999999999996
yeah that was but that was pretty much

3060.78 --> 3064.4
during my girlfriend

3068.88 --> 3071.9
right yeah

3072.66 --> 3076.7999999999997
that's when I restarted again because it

3075.3 --> 3079.579
at first it seemed to have like

3076.8 --> 3083.3590000000004
rejuvenating effects on me and she

3079.579 --> 3083.3590000000004
appreciated that so

3084.18 --> 3089.839
yeah anyway

3086.22 --> 3089.839
but yeah it's

3092.04 --> 3096.119
it all depends with cannabis unlike how

3094.2 --> 3098.16
it actually influences your life for

3096.119 --> 3100.079
some people it's

3098.16 --> 3101.94
bad

3100.079 --> 3103.98
in the sense that they become all

3101.94 --> 3106.44
pacified from it and then they don't

3103.98 --> 3109.14
want to do anything anymore

3106.44 --> 3111.98
but with others

3109.14 --> 3114.66
they get more

3111.98 --> 3117.26
psychotropic qualities out of it and

3114.66 --> 3117.2599999999998
they yeah

3117.66 --> 3123.48
it's very difficult to say

3121.5 --> 3126.3
it's diff more difficult for me to give

3123.48 --> 3129.599
advice on how to create cannabis

3126.3 --> 3131.88
because it's not so distinct

3129.599 --> 3134.339
compared to alcohol which is like really

3131.88 --> 3136.5
straightforward like what it does and

3134.339 --> 3141.5
and how it is addicting it's much more

3136.5 --> 3141.5
easy to identify than with cannabis

3141.839 --> 3145.38
right there's people that smoke

3143.46 --> 3148.559
occasional cannabis

3145.38 --> 3150.3
and but they just do it sometimes like

3148.559 --> 3152.579
once in a month or something and they do

3150.3 --> 3154.2000000000003
that their entire life and that works

3152.579 --> 3156.9
perfectly fine they're not addicted and

3154.2 --> 3159.9199999999996
if they don't smoke then they don't care

3156.9 --> 3159.92
I don't get that

3160.92 --> 3166.92
I mean when I get into it

3163.98 --> 3169.16
it does so much it makes such a

3166.92 --> 3169.16
difference

3170.339 --> 3175.339
that I tend to like want to stay into

3173.04 --> 3175.339
that

3176.52 --> 3180.24
or at least I had much more that I

3178.74 --> 3182.7
wanted to stay into that when I was

3180.24 --> 3185.2799999999997
younger because it had a more enriching

3182.7 --> 3188.3999999999996
effect to me

3185.28 --> 3190.079
very comfortable comfortable blanket but

3188.4 --> 3194.7200000000003
that blanket kind of went away over time

3190.079 --> 3194.7200000000003
so now it only has the other effects

3195.18 --> 3200.3999999999996
including relaxation but it's like very

3197.94 --> 3202.44
more physical relaxation

3200.4 --> 3205.099
and of course the cannabinoids have

3202.44 --> 3205.099
their influence

3205.68 --> 3211.64
foreign

3207.38 --> 3211.6400000000003
so that's my advice on that

3212.52 --> 3216.74
the only way I know is just cold turkey

3224.64 --> 3228.66
right but yeah it's like what are you

3226.68 --> 3230.339
gonna do with that because for me if I

3228.66 --> 3232.2599999999998
really stop cannabis that would

3230.339 --> 3234.7799999999997
effectively then mean okay so then I'm

3232.26 --> 3237.6800000000003
gonna smoke because for me it is also

3234.78 --> 3237.6800000000003
habit-based

3238.2 --> 3244.0789999999997
it's also that I kind of just like to

3240.42 --> 3246.7200000000003
smoke it's like micro smoke breaks which

3244.079 --> 3248.819
I do just

3246.72 --> 3250.6189999999997
whenever because yeah I'm just here

3248.819 --> 3252.3
alone I don't have like a work schedule

3250.619 --> 3256.02
or anything

3252.3 --> 3260.059
except for the early bird show

3256.02 --> 3260.059
really the rest is all optional

3262.2 --> 3268.859
so yeah for me it's like biggest issue

3265.68 --> 3272.359
is like what the hell am I gonna do

3268.859 --> 3272.359
instead of smoking

3272.4 --> 3276.78
so I'm certainly not gonna go like a

3274.74 --> 3279.66
lollipops or anything

3276.78 --> 3283.7000000000003
because I I can't risk getting on sugar

3279.66 --> 3283.7
again like that would be bad

3288.839 --> 3292.94
right so it I'm not there yet

3299.88 --> 3304.559
is there are there a lot of smokers in

3301.98 --> 3306.66
the Netherlands

3304.559 --> 3310.46
well not as much as there used to be but

3306.66 --> 3310.46
yeah there's still plenty around

3312.18 --> 3316.94
I mean out there in the streets there's

3313.98 --> 3316.94
still people smoking

3327.059 --> 3335.059
but yeah not as much as as when I was

3330.0 --> 3335.059
younger more more people smoke then

3338.0 --> 3342.839
but that's not strange because of all

3340.44 --> 3345.66
the policies that have rolled out over

3342.839 --> 3349.339
the decades since

3345.66 --> 3349.339
it's been highly discouraged

3360.48 --> 3367.22
a lot of smoking rooms like even at work

3364.079 --> 3367.2200000000003
have just disappeared

3383.22 --> 3386.1189999999997
foreign

3392.66 --> 3398.22
thing though that I'm really noticing on

3395.4 --> 3400.859
average steamy Travelers that

3398.22 --> 3404.339
like there are some when I go to the

3400.859 --> 3407.2799999999997
coffee shop there's plenty of like

3404.339 --> 3409.2
working men that come there like

3407.28 --> 3412.559
especially more physical type labors

3409.2 --> 3415.64
like painters I see there coming and

3412.559 --> 3415.6400000000003
like uh

3416.339 --> 3421.68
people that will probably work in like

3418.8 --> 3424.1400000000003
road construction and such they also

3421.68 --> 3427.2
come there and because but they're all

3424.14 --> 3429.2999999999997
they're never like the fat ones because

3427.2 --> 3432.1189999999997
you know the fat ones they relax by

3429.3 --> 3434.52
drinking right and they become fat but

3432.119 --> 3436.079
like there's not a lot of like fat

3434.52 --> 3437.7
people that I see in the coffee shop

3436.079 --> 3440.28
really never

3437.7 --> 3442.68
and some people are just a kind of

3440.28 --> 3446.78
shaped like that but you never get like

3442.68 --> 3446.7799999999997
a really fat person I never seen those

3447.839 --> 3450.619
it's kind of funny

3453.059 --> 3456.2400000000002
right but there's still plenty of like

3454.859 --> 3459.9
uh

3456.24 --> 3461.22
like well people that are probably kind

3459.9 --> 3465.54
of poor

3461.22 --> 3467.9399999999996
social welfare types they also go to the

3465.54 --> 3471.48
coffee shop oh look at me I'm

3467.94 --> 3473.599
technically one of those sort of yeah I

3471.48 --> 3473.599
know

3475.859 --> 3480.38
but also still plenty of just working

3478.02 --> 3480.38
men

3484.38 --> 3490.92
and working women even I think but you

3488.339 --> 3493.099
don't really see a lot of like suits or

3490.92 --> 3493.099
anything

3499.579 --> 3505.02
I think some ladies probably like into

3502.68 --> 3507.2
making clothes and stuff also come there

3505.02 --> 3509.7
more hippie types

3507.2 --> 3512.359
now they're still there's still some

3509.7 --> 3512.359
hippies around

3513.0 --> 3518.16
I mean it's still interesting like it's

3515.94 --> 3520.44
not just all homogenized that everybody

3518.16 --> 3523.6189999999997
looks the same although there is still

3520.44 --> 3525.54
like a class of very typically like that

3523.619 --> 3527.28
they go with the newest thing and

3525.54 --> 3530.099
they're like oh

3527.28 --> 3533.3390000000004
why are you doing that

3530.099 --> 3535.26
and there's some sjw types around like

3533.339 --> 3537.839
hysterical looking women and all that

3535.26 --> 3542.2990000000004
those are there as well here but it

3537.839 --> 3542.299
means Utrecht is a pretty big city

3542.4 --> 3547.14
but on average I think yeah everybody is

3545.88 --> 3552.26
pretty cool

3547.14 --> 3552.2599999999998
like even the sjws here aren't like

3552.72 --> 3557.5789999999997
even that terrible I feel or maybe

3555.359 --> 3558.66
they're just not that terrible here I'm

3557.579 --> 3561.1800000000003
not sure

3558.66 --> 3564.18
maybe it's the the atmosphere of the

3561.18 --> 3567.24
city itself that just like people don't

3564.18 --> 3569.64
do that it's not like there's constant

3567.24 --> 3572.22
Hassle and fighting people screaming at

3569.64 --> 3574.5789999999997
each other that just doesn't really seem

3572.22 --> 3574.5789999999997
to happen

3577.68 --> 3582.5989999999997
and then there's sometimes there's like

3579.119 --> 3587.78
just crowd like special markets and then

3582.599 --> 3587.78
gets really crowded but even then like

3587.94 --> 3594.26
is not like a lot of [ __ ] happening

3591.359 --> 3594.2599999999998
that's bad

3594.599 --> 3599.96
so yeah I'm I'm satisfied about my city

3603.42 --> 3607.6800000000003
I hope they keep it up

3605.46 --> 3610.28
I mean one thing that does annoy me is

3607.68 --> 3610.2799999999997
those guys

3610.74 --> 3616.2599999999998
that go around in cars

3614.22 --> 3618.0
playing loud music in the middle of the

3616.26 --> 3621.119
night and then go parking right over

3618.0 --> 3622.44
there I do freaking hate those but

3621.119 --> 3624.96
I mean

3622.44 --> 3627.799
they haven't done that recently so I'm

3624.96 --> 3633.02
kind of happy about that don't do that

3627.799 --> 3633.02
anymore thanks just go somewhere else

3633.66 --> 3639.96
or use headphones anyway

3636.96 --> 3639.96
s

3647.46 --> 3654.359
so kind of rambling on talking about all

3650.76 --> 3657.1800000000003
kinds of things now about the city and

3654.359 --> 3659.16
what it's like the types that are here

3657.18 --> 3660.72
starting out with the coffee shop what I

3659.16 --> 3662.8799999999997
see in there because yeah I do come in

3660.72 --> 3666.5589999999997
there and people are standing in a row I

3662.88 --> 3666.559
get to see like what is here

3694.38 --> 3701.839
anyway yeah whatever guys

3698.339 --> 3701.839
are you woken up yet

3709.4 --> 3715.26
oh by the way like there's some really

3712.5 --> 3717.359
[ __ ] up [ __ ] that's probably not gonna

3715.26 --> 3719.4
happen but

3717.359 --> 3722.339
I mean some of Paul some of these

3719.4 --> 3724.559
politicians these bastards wvf

3722.339 --> 3726.7799999999997
politicians here are literally trying to

3724.559 --> 3730.2000000000003
reintroduce

3726.78 --> 3734.1600000000003
like military service

3730.2 --> 3737.22
for Ukraine like to go to the lit

3734.16 --> 3741.54
they're literally saying that now

3737.22 --> 3744.02
apparently like what the [ __ ] man what

3741.54 --> 3744.02
the [ __ ]

3744.359 --> 3751.02
really you want to freaking Force our

3747.48 --> 3754.4
youth to fight in your freaking Nazi war

3751.02 --> 3754.4
you sick bastard

3754.559 --> 3757.8190000000004
what the hell man

3758.4 --> 3764.839
but yeah this is very unlikely that

3761.4 --> 3764.839
that's gonna happen I mean like

3768.599 --> 3773.52
just Googled Utrecht beautiful city yeah

3771.42 --> 3776.7000000000003
it has it has very beautiful Parts

3773.52 --> 3778.799
definitely and overall kind of

3776.7 --> 3780.8999999999996
picturesque there's a lot of green a lot

3778.799 --> 3785.88
of trees

3780.9 --> 3787.859
excellent like a little water channels

3785.88 --> 3790.98
some bridges here it's really

3787.859 --> 3795.0
picturesque it's like a

3790.98 --> 3796.92
a little less aggressive than Amsterdam

3795.0 --> 3798.96
because Amsterdam has a lot of that too

3796.92 --> 3801.78
although less trees

3798.96 --> 3804.78
and more channels

3801.78 --> 3807.6600000000003
right bigger channels in your track well

3804.78 --> 3810.599
there's that too but it's just smaller

3807.66 --> 3813.359
and more cozy looking and more trees

3810.599 --> 3816.42
more green

3813.359 --> 3820.2799999999997
and the outer parts of Utrecht not the

3816.42 --> 3820.28
inner ring yeah they're very green

3820.68 --> 3826.5589999999997
it's not like there's towering flat

3824.46 --> 3828.92
buildings everywhere there is one

3826.559 --> 3831.8390000000004
section though it's like

3828.92 --> 3835.92
but yeah that section

3831.839 --> 3838.5589999999997
it's it's in the Southwest

3835.92 --> 3841.799
there's more high-rise buildings there

3838.559 --> 3844.38
and that is kind of like less green and

3841.799 --> 3847.2599999999998
it's just that I don't like it there at

3844.38 --> 3849.299
all I don't want to live there hello

3847.26 --> 3850.8590000000004
it's like it feels like there and [ __ ]

3849.299 --> 3852.96
does happen there

3850.859 --> 3855.359
domestic violence

3852.96 --> 3857.4
but it's like in that region really and

3855.359 --> 3858.66
the rest

3857.4 --> 3861.78
it's

3858.66 --> 3864.24
barely noticeable

3861.78 --> 3866.099
or well maybe it's just really that I'm

3864.24 --> 3869.839
lucky right here that here it's

3866.099 --> 3869.839
relatively very civil

3871.26 --> 3875.1800000000003
but yeah I mean

3875.76 --> 3879.619
I like it I like the city

3879.66 --> 3887.5789999999997
I think there is a like a

3882.66 --> 3889.799
a calming spell over it

3887.579 --> 3893.8390000000004
it doesn't feel like it's getting pushed

3889.799 --> 3893.839
into like war zone or anything

3894.44 --> 3900.359
and I mean there is some of that type of

3897.78 --> 3902.94
thing happening in other cities well

3900.359 --> 3904.98
like arguably Amsterdam where well

3902.94 --> 3907.079
that's a protest City so a lot of

3904.98 --> 3910.319
protests and and [ __ ] that the police

3907.079 --> 3913.2000000000003
does happened there and that's a that

3910.319 --> 3916.799
loads the energy of the entire city so

3913.2 --> 3918.8999999999996
it gets more tense and then

3916.799 --> 3921.54
well

3918.9 --> 3924.48
things happen because of that and but

3921.54 --> 3926.52
like rotter them and then Hague really

3924.48 --> 3928.619
big cities then Hague being like the

3926.52 --> 3930.0
capital city or well not Amsterdam is

3928.619 --> 3931.619
technically the capital city but then

3930.0 --> 3933.119
heck is where the

3931.619 --> 3934.619
the government

3933.119 --> 3937.2200000000003
really is

3934.619 --> 3937.2200000000003
seated

3938.339 --> 3944.46
the Parliament and all that

3940.799 --> 3950.16
and those City there's a lot of crime

3944.46 --> 3952.94
and like crazy like gangs and [ __ ] but

3950.16 --> 3955.3799999999997
there's also like well

3952.94 --> 3957.7200000000003
minority concentrations there because

3955.38 --> 3961.38
they really

3957.72 --> 3963.9599999999996
just pumped a lot of those in there

3961.38 --> 3966.48
at some stage I think they still kind of

3963.96 --> 3968.76
tend to do that and it's

3966.48 --> 3971.52
yeah I mean I wouldn't want to live in

3968.76 --> 3974.3390000000004
those places either but this big city

3971.52 --> 3976.92
I mean it really is an exception

3974.339 --> 3979.02
it's not like those other cities and I

3976.92 --> 3981.7200000000003
really want to keep it that way and I

3979.02 --> 3983.52
hope that they don't just like over SGA

3981.72 --> 3986.16
W everything

3983.52 --> 3988.5
I hope they really tone that down

3986.16 --> 3991.819
and especially like

3988.5 --> 3991.819
leave the children alone

3992.16 --> 3996.66
if if anything like if I was like

3994.319 --> 3998.9
somehow politically active I focus

3996.66 --> 4002.24
probably on that on like

3998.9 --> 4004.039
preventing schools from teaching sjw

4002.24 --> 4008.18
[ __ ] and

4004.039 --> 4010.5200000000004
gender [ __ ] to Little Children I'd

4008.18 --> 4012.02
really I would want to make effort for

4010.52 --> 4014.799
that because that's something that's

4012.02 --> 4014.799
really terrible

4016.4 --> 4021.14
and I even expressed that by the way

4018.38 --> 4025.42
like in interactions with

4021.14 --> 4025.42
people in the government here

4026.539 --> 4030.7990000000004
that I'm worried about that because it

4028.579 --> 4032.3590000000004
it would have a terrible influence on

4030.799 --> 4035.24
the culture that's going to pop out of

4032.359 --> 4036.44
that here I mean all those kids are if

4035.24 --> 4039.3799999999997
they're going to be indoctrinated with

4036.44 --> 4040.76
that they're going to be bad a bad

4039.38 --> 4044.599
influence

4040.76 --> 4048.079
they're going to be whining a lot

4044.599 --> 4050.98
making things more gay and deranged

4048.079 --> 4050.98
I don't want that

4052.46 --> 4056.559
did you get farmer protests

4058.16 --> 4063.14
uh yeah

4059.78 --> 4064.8190000000004
well not not in this specific part of

4063.14 --> 4067.46
the city though

4064.819 --> 4068.7799999999997
but yeah they have been doing things in

4067.46 --> 4071.599
another part

4068.78 --> 4073.52
so I heard I didn't go there

4071.599 --> 4075.559
I did it wasn't even aware was happening

4073.52 --> 4078.88
when that was happening

4075.559 --> 4078.88
only heard afterward

4080.18 --> 4085.2799999999997
but I mean farmer protests have been

4083.18 --> 4086.8999999999996
almost everywhere

4085.28 --> 4088.46
in the Netherlands when that happened

4086.9 --> 4091.0
and there's a good chance it's gonna

4088.46 --> 4091.0
happen again

4091.52 --> 4096.56
we're gonna do it again because well

4093.92 --> 4099.08
government has not changed

4096.56 --> 4101.4800000000005
anything they're literally going forward

4099.08 --> 4104.199
exactly as planned despite everything

4101.48 --> 4104.199
despite

4106.52 --> 4112.96
despite everything and there's been like

4109.759 --> 4115.88
I mean so everybody is against it

4112.96 --> 4119.44
everybody except those freaking

4115.88 --> 4119.4400000000005
conspirator maniacs

4119.569 --> 4122.688
[Music]

4132.56 --> 4137.4400000000005
and it was in the UK blacked it out yeah

4141.739 --> 4146.299
I mean it's not going to be on the

4143.779 --> 4149.42
regular news

4146.299 --> 4151.1
I mean we've got some really horrific

4149.42 --> 4152.839
media here

4151.1 --> 4155.839
horrific

4152.839 --> 4158.54
that is just straight out fascist

4155.839 --> 4161.6
pretending to be moral and Democratic

4158.54 --> 4162.62
like but straight out fascist it's so

4161.6 --> 4166.160000000001
horrific

4162.62 --> 4169.66
and they've been [ __ ] on the farmers

4166.16 --> 4169.66
and it's all terrible

4172.1 --> 4176.96
but there's still there's a lot of

4174.319 --> 4180.02
alternative stuff happening alternative

4176.96 --> 4181.94
media and developments with that

4180.02 --> 4184.759
this one media organization that even

4181.94 --> 4186.379999999999
has a slot on the television and the

4184.759 --> 4190.48
cartel parties are trying to do

4186.38 --> 4190.4800000000005
everything to get them kicked out

4191.779 --> 4195.9400000000005
because they actually report the news

4196.699 --> 4201.199
of what's Happening

4199.1 --> 4203.0
but yeah through alternative circuits

4201.199 --> 4207.94
you could still just get a lot of

4203.0 --> 4207.94
information everywhere even from the UK

4209.6 --> 4216.1990000000005
I mean don't expect the mainstream news

4212.179 --> 4218.179
to report on anything relevant ever like

4216.199 --> 4220.159
ever again it's just there to program

4218.179 --> 4222.64
you to freaking kill yourself that

4220.159 --> 4222.639999999999
that's it

4223.82 --> 4230.889999999999
that's all that is right now

4227.73 --> 4230.889999999999
[Music]

4233.2 --> 4237.75
[Music]

4238.58 --> 4244.88
I mean the corruption is 100 it's so bad

4242.06 --> 4245.96
it's like as terrible as it could be

4244.88 --> 4248.96
it's

4245.96 --> 4251.84
arguably worse

4248.96 --> 4256.0
than the media stuff that roll out of

4251.84 --> 4256.0
Nazi Germany arguably worse

4257.659 --> 4261.5599999999995
and with more deadly results even

4259.76 --> 4263.030000000001
already

4261.56 --> 4264.26
so

4263.03 --> 4267.699
[Music]

4264.26 --> 4267.6990000000005
just don't watch the news

4269.48 --> 4274.04
just go looking for it on the internet

4272.0 --> 4275.48
there will be stuff and that will be

4274.04 --> 4277.58
thrown off the internet and then there

4275.48 --> 4280.339999999999
will be other stuff that will have it as

4277.58 --> 4282.679
well and then eventually

4280.34 --> 4285.860000000001
you'll figure it out

4282.679 --> 4288.76
and you'll find your sources who knows

4285.86 --> 4288.759999999999
where to get it

4293.719 --> 4298.52
so I had absolutely no problem finding

4296.179 --> 4300.62
videos about that because I got my

4298.52 --> 4302.900000000001
sources

4300.62 --> 4305.599999999999
I mean they're not like really super

4302.9 --> 4307.58
sources like I'm not like oh I got the

4305.6 --> 4310.9400000000005
source right at the root or anything but

4307.58 --> 4312.86
still decent filter groups because it's

4310.94 --> 4315.44
basically sites

4312.86 --> 4317.9
that are like filters and they pick up

4315.44 --> 4322.04
on things and then they collect based on

4317.9 --> 4323.9
how they like to arrange

4322.04 --> 4325.159
the info yeah what they want to

4323.9 --> 4326.719
communicate

4325.159 --> 4330.099999999999
and you can figure that out like oh

4326.719 --> 4330.1
these people do this kind of thing

4332.719 --> 4336.679
but you can still derive like the

4334.52 --> 4338.0
quality of the information if they

4336.679 --> 4342.5
Source it

4338.0 --> 4345.86
so I like alternative news websites that

4342.5 --> 4347.78
actually Source their articles

4345.86 --> 4350.62
and the better it Source the better the

4347.78 --> 4354.739
quality right for example Alex Jones

4350.62 --> 4356.3
right now in four words and all I

4354.739 --> 4359.299999999999
it's

4356.3 --> 4360.7390000000005
a real serious waste of my time so I

4359.3 --> 4363.14
don't really go there anymore like ever

4360.739 --> 4365.718999999999
I mean I still watch Alex Jones Show on

4363.14 --> 4367.280000000001
that video but I don't go to enforce

4365.719 --> 4369.44
anymore it's nothing there

4367.28 --> 4370.88
there's nothing there

4369.44 --> 4375.219
it's oh

4370.88 --> 4375.219
garbage to me but

4375.26 --> 4379.780000000001
back in the day

4377.48 --> 4385.159
like between

4379.78 --> 4387.5
2006 and 2010 one is really into it

4385.159 --> 4390.139999999999
there were some article writings that

4387.5 --> 4393.199
were so detailed and they would like put

4390.14 --> 4394.46
hype like one article would have like

4393.199 --> 4396.5599999999995
20

4394.46 --> 4400.1
40 hyperlinks

4396.56 --> 4402.679
that were all real solid links

4400.1 --> 4405.9800000000005
they put so much effort into the

4402.679 --> 4408.14
information and I would then relay that

4405.98 --> 4410.659
on a forum basically copy the whole

4408.14 --> 4412.46
thing with links and all put a lot of

4410.659 --> 4415.299999999999
effort in doing that because they were

4412.46 --> 4415.3
really good articles

4416.179 --> 4422.179
right

4418.34 --> 4425.84
so find your sources But realize also

4422.179 --> 4427.6990000000005
sources can degrade over time

4425.84 --> 4429.7390000000005
and eventually you'll have to find

4427.699 --> 4432.678999999999
better sources

4429.739 --> 4435.379999999999
but usually through your Source you can

4432.679 --> 4437.78
find their sourcing and then figure out

4435.38 --> 4439.76
which of their sources are more reliable

4437.78 --> 4442.46
right so you just hope for source source

4439.76 --> 4444.5
source source until you you just know

4442.46 --> 4447.38
this is right for now

4444.5 --> 4450.46
and if they corrupt then you better well

4447.38 --> 4450.46
pay attention to that

4451.82 --> 4456.92
as Infowars just gotten lazy

4454.64 --> 4458.3
now they've gotten themselves damned in

4456.92 --> 4459.09
I think

4458.3 --> 4462.279
they just

4459.09 --> 4462.279
[Music]

4466.159 --> 4471.5
they got themselves damned in and

4468.44 --> 4473.0
because of just all the hassle

4471.5 --> 4476.239
and all the

4473.0 --> 4479.48
lying and garbage and just terrible

4476.239 --> 4481.82
Behavior behind the scenes

4479.48 --> 4484.099999999999
people kind of like

4481.82 --> 4486.32
they they lost the spirit of it because

4484.1 --> 4489.679
originally it was really about We're

4486.32 --> 4493.04
Gonna Save America for real

4489.679 --> 4494.54
and now he's just kind of becoming the

4493.04 --> 4497.3
news

4494.54 --> 4499.04
without doing anything and people in

4497.3 --> 4500.84
there they do a lot of research they

4499.04 --> 4505.12
figure out things they figure out like

4500.84 --> 4505.12
wait this entire thing is actually a lie

4506.06 --> 4510.92
and that's really annoying like for

4508.34 --> 4513.1990000000005
example I bet that a lot of the crew are

4510.92 --> 4516.02
kind of disappointed and agitated but

4513.199 --> 4520.36
also like as Alex when he started hyping

4516.02 --> 4524.96
about oh EMP and the balloons and oh

4520.36 --> 4527.179
pulling all that back from the past

4524.96 --> 4530.3
and they're like yeah but it's seriously

4527.179 --> 4533.56
nonsense Owen Troyer even that same day

4530.3 --> 4533.56
was from the Friday show

4533.719 --> 4536.84
even said like yeah I don't believe in

4535.58 --> 4538.94
that at all I think it's all a giant

4536.84 --> 4539.900000000001
distraction so there is division about

4538.94 --> 4543.08
that

4539.9 --> 4545.719
even among the crew

4543.08 --> 4547.64
so the entire chemistry of how it works

4545.719 --> 4550.58
there has just changed

4547.64 --> 4553.76
at first it was a real uniform spirit

4550.58 --> 4555.04
that drove everybody to really give it

4553.76 --> 4557.780000000001
like a

4555.04 --> 4560.42
Divine quality

4557.78 --> 4562.699
and that just doesn't work anymore Alex

4560.42 --> 4565.88
has basically

4562.699 --> 4567.678999999999
[ __ ] in his own Pond too many times

4565.88 --> 4571.159000000001
you could say

4567.679 --> 4573.14
and he managed to fix it legally and all

4571.159 --> 4575.659
that and yeah

4573.14 --> 4578.56
but it's just turn it all into kind of a

4575.659 --> 4578.5599999999995
corporation War

4579.199 --> 4583.46
although

4580.46 --> 4587.9
well at least Alex still just allows his

4583.46 --> 4590.6
crew to literally openly contradict him

4587.9 --> 4593.12
and roll out another narrative

4590.6 --> 4595.280000000001
so that is still probably what holds it

4593.12 --> 4599.14
together I mean if they all had to fall

4595.28 --> 4599.139999999999
in line it'll be over very quickly

4600.14 --> 4607.179
because Alex Jones really is at this

4603.02 --> 4607.179
point the tip of the Spear of Fear Part

4608.0 --> 4612.88
yes

4609.38 --> 4612.88
I think he's even proud of it

4613.94 --> 4619.4
and he probably believes it

4617.3 --> 4623.62
or at times

4619.4 --> 4623.62
he's just so used to doing that

4635.239 --> 4638.239
wow

4639.38 --> 4642.76
freaking original man

4645.82 --> 4653.0199999999995
okay to keep your Mania company

4649.04 --> 4653.0199999999995
well yeah in certain ways definitely

4654.88 --> 4661.84
Infowars tries to like collect its own

4658.34 --> 4665.54
brand of opposition in that sense

4661.84 --> 4667.76
absolutely controlled very much

4665.54 --> 4671.42
controlled opposition

4667.76 --> 4673.34
but in a way independent still

4671.42 --> 4677.06
think

4673.34 --> 4680.4800000000005
partial it's confusing

4677.06 --> 4682.52
but he literally rejects certain people

4680.48 --> 4686.98
and it's almost like for almost Secret

4682.52 --> 4686.9800000000005
Service style reason is really weird

4688.76 --> 4693.1
is fair porn profitable yes

4693.8 --> 4698.54
it well in

4695.659 --> 4701.0
it makes you eager to find a solution

4698.54 --> 4702.56
and if you're going to say yeah well the

4701.0 --> 4704.6
problem is is that you're weak and

4702.56 --> 4706.04
you're not taking care of yourself and

4704.6 --> 4708.02
then yeah

4706.04 --> 4710.78
getting the supplements which are really

4708.02 --> 4712.6990000000005
good I by the way I'm never gonna say oh

4710.78 --> 4715.94
the quality is actually really [ __ ] no

4712.699 --> 4718.339999999999
his products are really good

4715.94 --> 4721.219
but he does like there is a conjunction

4718.34 --> 4725.02
between the fear porn and selling it it

4721.219 --> 4725.02
is it just is that's just true

4735.679 --> 4740.78
so in that sense yeah fear porn does

4738.26 --> 4743.7390000000005
sell and that's why he does it that's

4740.78 --> 4743.739
why he keeps doing it

4748.34 --> 4753.28
sells a lot of products yeah yeah no all

4750.739 --> 4753.28
kinds of things

4754.699 --> 4759.86
but I've been pretty much exclusively

4757.82 --> 4761.42
interested in supplements not so much

4759.86 --> 4763.639999999999
that other stuff

4761.42 --> 4765.92
I mean they have preparation things and

4763.64 --> 4767.719
they have like food they just entire

4765.92 --> 4769.82
food storage

4767.719 --> 4771.76
all kinds of things that they've

4769.82 --> 4774.879
connected up with

4771.76 --> 4774.879
[Music]

4778.46 --> 4784.36
like your own trigger yeah of course

4781.88 --> 4784.36
of course

4784.4 --> 4786.58
foreign

4791.239 --> 4797.32
if you want any kind of radio Television

4794.12 --> 4797.32
Internet reach

4798.08 --> 4804.08
well who who actually has that equipment

4801.14 --> 4807.02
that does all that

4804.08 --> 4809.44
yeah people that are on a strict Globe

4807.02 --> 4809.4400000000005
regime

4810.86 --> 4816.799999999999
so if you then go about Flat Earth yeah

4814.4 --> 4820.9
you don't get to go get that big it just

4816.8 --> 4820.900000000001
doesn't happen it's just a fact

4821.92 --> 4827.42
right I mean

4824.179 --> 4829.4
maybe when Alex Jones first really

4827.42 --> 4832.52
figured out what flatter that it's there

4829.4 --> 4834.5
he he was probably even

4832.52 --> 4837.38
okay with that

4834.5 --> 4839.54
but he was just red lighted in the

4837.38 --> 4841.58
background a lot with it like don't do

4839.54 --> 4845.0
that don't do that I'm pretty sure by

4841.58 --> 4847.82
his guys by his sources

4845.0 --> 4850.82
and it's just like no

4847.82 --> 4853.159
never never flatter because that's that

4850.82 --> 4855.62
would ruin my operation

4853.159 --> 4858.28
I think he even said that at some point

4855.62 --> 4858.28
so

4859.219 --> 4865.84
might be wrong about that but anyway

4861.739 --> 4865.839999999999
yeah he Gates keeps but

4866.659 --> 4871.699
I mean tell me about this giant media

4869.48 --> 4874.339999999999
operation

4871.699 --> 4877.04
that is actually gigantic

4874.34 --> 4878.12
with like millions and millions of

4877.04 --> 4883.9
people

4878.12 --> 4883.9
following it clearly that is Flat Earth

4886.34 --> 4892.04
just just show me the big well-sponsored

4889.82 --> 4895.48
media operation that is about Flat Earth

4892.04 --> 4895.48
then and then we'll talk

4897.08 --> 4901.219
this is interesting yeah I don't know

4899.06 --> 4903.080000000001
tarot is it interesting to watch because

4901.219 --> 4904.699
I don't know what it is you just gave me

4903.08 --> 4906.62
a link and just say this is interesting

4904.699 --> 4911.08
so what is it

4906.62 --> 4911.08
would be nice to say what it is

4916.52 --> 4919.120000000001
Tarot

4934.34 --> 4939.56
ah okay

4936.679 --> 4941.679
let's name the other documentary all

4939.56 --> 4941.679
right

4943.88 --> 4947.08
that could be interesting

4950.3 --> 4955.4800000000005
41 minutes that's I think I've seen this

4953.3 --> 4955.4800000000005
one

4957.199 --> 4961.5199999999995
yeah I've seen or at least parts of this

4959.6 --> 4963.8
in

4961.52 --> 4966.4400000000005
in presentations

4963.8 --> 4968.38
yeah I recognize that but that's

4966.44 --> 4971.54
interesting I'd like to re-watch that

4968.38 --> 4974.1990000000005
nine years ago yeah see it's nine years

4971.54 --> 4974.199
ago man

4976.52 --> 4981.400000000001
so this is even before the Flat Earth

4978.739 --> 4981.4
revelation

4982.76 --> 4988.84
in 2014

4985.46 --> 4988.84
or right around that

4989.48 --> 4994.94
right but I'll keep the link there

4992.54 --> 4996.62
I'll watch that after this anyway I'm

4994.94 --> 4998.86
gonna take a two minute break be right

5143.08 --> 5147.46
I have been watching a lot of Owen

5144.94 --> 5150.48
Benjamin because he's like climbing back

5147.46 --> 5150.4800000000005
out of sickness and

5150.699 --> 5154.839999999999
last couple of streams have been really

5152.62 --> 5157.96
interesting

5154.84 --> 5161.219
I'm gonna finish up the Saturday stream

5157.96 --> 5161.219
this afternoon here

5170.38 --> 5172.56

5189.71 --> 5192.76
[Music]

5200.86 --> 5203.98

5203.32 --> 5206.38
up

nothing I sometimes I just can't tell

5214.48 --> 5217.08
with you guys

5218.92 --> 5223.139
that means five minutes later no comment

Discord server no

5239.33 --> 5242.46
[Music]

5242.86 --> 5247.239
I mean somebody at the time made it for

5245.56 --> 5248.8
me but

5247.239 --> 5251.799999999999
that's when you remember who that was

5248.8 --> 5254.76
but I'm just not

5251.8 --> 5259.1990000000005
really interested in using it I find

5254.76 --> 5259.1990000000005
Discord to be highly unreliable

5259.48 --> 5262.08
foreign

5265.51 --> 5268.76
[Music]

5271.139 --> 5276.52
much rather use Skype or stream yard or

5274.48 --> 5279.28
something

5276.52 --> 5282.219
because I don't want large panels

5279.28 --> 5285.58
on there anyway

5282.219 --> 5289.44
do anything Alex Jones is Bill Hicks

5285.58 --> 5289.44
no no I don't

5302.44 --> 5306.219
I think that Bill Hicks

5304.84 --> 5308.7390000000005
had

5306.219 --> 5313.679
different

5308.739 --> 5313.678999999999
muscle structure in his face slightly

5313.719 --> 5318.04
his skin seemed kind of the same but

5316.0 --> 5320.739
he's he's a different person but just

5318.04 --> 5322.48
slightly it's but it I mean especially

5320.739 --> 5324.4
at a distance yeah it's like really

5322.48 --> 5328.0
looking like Alex Jones but I mean it's

5324.4 --> 5331.138999999999
not him though almost

5328.0 --> 5331.139
it's just not him

5332.26 --> 5336.76
you do yeah well good for you

5334.78 --> 5338.739
good for you I think it's absolute

5336.76 --> 5343.139
nonsense and it's a waste of time even

5338.739 --> 5343.138999999999
bringing that up it's only a distraction

5343.25 --> 5346.979
[Music]

5347.52 --> 5352.659000000001
okay sure

5350.98 --> 5354.9
what type of refraction are you talking

5352.659 --> 5354.9
about

5359.159 --> 5363.839999999999
to discuss potential show topics

5363.88 --> 5366.6
Maybe

5368.58 --> 5373.36
or just

5370.54 --> 5376.36
I don't know my early bird Skype room

5373.36 --> 5378.159
which by the way nobody ever contacts me

5376.36 --> 5379.599999999999
on Skype for some reason even though

5378.159 --> 5382.98
I've had it for

5379.6 --> 5382.9800000000005
what is now five years

5384.159 --> 5389.679
that nobody ever posts anything in my

5387.28 --> 5392.34
in my flat Earth early bird chat 26

5389.679 --> 5392.34
participants

5396.88 --> 5403.6
so I kind of stopped caring because like

5400.179 --> 5406.42
nobody seems to ever look into that ever

5403.6 --> 5408.159000000001
right I mean that would be great hey if

5406.42 --> 5409.9
you were in there yeah you could just

5408.159 --> 5412.12
ramble about

5409.9 --> 5415.0
and even post

5412.12 --> 5416.32
things like hey this that I used it for

5415.0 --> 5417.76
that sort of

5416.32 --> 5420.94
but

5417.76 --> 5424.06
yeah nobody nobody contacts me on Skype

5420.94 --> 5427.239
nobody likes to use that I guess so okay

5424.06 --> 5429.780000000001
well then not

5427.239 --> 5432.5199999999995
foreign

5429.78 --> 5434.92
with people I need that time to prepare

5432.52 --> 5438.400000000001
I don't have time to chat before I start

5434.92 --> 5440.8
the show why do you think I start late

5438.4 --> 5444.839999999999
it's not because I have half an hour

5440.8 --> 5444.84
extra time before I start the show

5452.54 --> 5456.84
[Music]

5459.46 --> 5464.56
later seem to refract in a way as soon

5462.4 --> 5466.719
as possible to refract an image around

5464.56 --> 5467.9800000000005
the bend

5466.719 --> 5470.52
yes

5467.98 --> 5473.199
unless you have a

5470.52 --> 5475.06
consecutive set of

5473.199 --> 5477.099999999999
medium changes

5475.06 --> 5480.159000000001
that become more like more increasingly

5477.1 --> 5482.08
dense and then you might sort of but

5480.159 --> 5484.5
that's not the situation here on Earth

5482.08 --> 5484.5
of course

5486.12 --> 5492.58
because refraction like actual

5489.219 --> 5496.36
refraction the way it works is

5492.58 --> 5500.32
is not a Bend it's a straight line until

5496.36 --> 5504.58
medium change and then the angle the

5500.32 --> 5507.699
exit angle suddenly changes to another

5504.58 --> 5509.679
angle it doesn't go around a curve it

5507.699 --> 5513.04
just changes angle

5509.679 --> 5516.219
until it changes the medium

5513.04 --> 5517.9
or like until the end of the medium like

5516.219 --> 5519.94
a glass block

5517.9 --> 5521.32
and then it changes again depending on

5519.94 --> 5524.5199999999995
the condition

5521.32 --> 5524.5199999999995
that's refraction

5525.1 --> 5530.280000000001
and it's an angle change depending on

5527.5 --> 5530.28
medium change

5533.38 --> 5539.86
the light cannot bend in a homogeneous

5535.84 --> 5545.46
median it doesn't do that

5539.86 --> 5545.46
only bends upon medium alteration

5548.32 --> 5554.32
and if that Medium alteration is kind of

5550.84 --> 5556.679
fuzzy not in like a transitional

5554.32 --> 5561.94
situation

5556.679 --> 5561.9400000000005
then becomes even more confusing

5563.92 --> 5569.8
but yeah the main factor about

5565.96 --> 5572.8
refraction is that it happens due to

5569.8 --> 5575.52
transition of a median

5572.8 --> 5575.52
into another

5580.659 --> 5586.0
the exit angle

5584.26 --> 5589.42
I'm just talking about the actual

5586.0 --> 5591.96
scenario right there's a medium change

5589.42 --> 5594.34
here's air here's glass

5591.96 --> 5598.92
entry angle

5594.34 --> 5598.92
exit angle that's what I'm talking about

5606.159 --> 5612.219
it's not random by the way it's very

5608.139 --> 5615.6990000000005
specific the exit angle is dependent on

5612.219 --> 5617.7390000000005
the refraction index of the material did

5615.699 --> 5620.138999999999
you know that all transparent material

5617.739 --> 5622.299999999999
has refraction index

5620.139 --> 5623.5
sizing up

5622.3 --> 5626.38
literally

5623.5 --> 5628.48
just you can literally look that up

5626.38 --> 5631.02
the refraction index of a specific

5628.48 --> 5631.0199999999995
material

5631.36 --> 5636.4
because for example refraction index of

5634.179 --> 5638.38
water is very different from glass

5636.4 --> 5640.48
although not that much different it's

5638.38 --> 5644.9400000000005
kind of close but still different and

5640.48 --> 5644.94
that's very different from say diamond

5647.44 --> 5652.178999999999
which is much more dense

5649.6 --> 5654.280000000001
and the more dense it is a funny thing

5652.179 --> 5655.96
right there's we know about oh speed

5654.28 --> 5658.8
it's a relative density and all that

5655.96 --> 5661.9
depending on how

5658.8 --> 5663.34
how much the offset is between the

5661.9 --> 5666.219
density of the medium and the object

5663.34 --> 5667.42
well in a way that applies to refraction

5666.219 --> 5671.56
too

5667.42 --> 5673.9
Yeah the more dense the new medium is

5671.56 --> 5676.120000000001
the more dramatic the the angle

5673.9 --> 5679.259999999999
alteration

5676.12 --> 5679.26
isn't that just funny

5693.699 --> 5695.879999999999
foreign

5700.0 --> 5702.54
okay

5708.159 --> 5711.96
I adverted but I

5715.36 --> 5720.759999999999
oh is that Snell's law

5718.84 --> 5723.54
what I just described this Snell's law

5720.76 --> 5723.54
that's hysterical

5724.96 --> 5731.32
just goes to show that I am not much of

5727.6 --> 5733.2390000000005
the whole math side of this of this

5731.32 --> 5735.659
physics because it is in the physics

5733.239 --> 5735.659
Realm

5736.06 --> 5743.56
but I understand it well enough to

5740.26 --> 5746.02
describe it huh

5743.56 --> 5747.52
so I don't it's like you say Snow's law

5746.02 --> 5750.76
and then somebody could look that up and

5747.52 --> 5753.820000000001
be like what what is all this math stuff

5750.76 --> 5755.9800000000005
well I will just describe it

5753.82 --> 5758.5599999999995
in words

5755.98 --> 5760.78
and a bunch of hand gestures angle in

5758.56 --> 5764.280000000001
entry and no exit

5760.78 --> 5764.28
higher the density

5764.56 --> 5769.4800000000005
offset of the medium the steeper the

5767.679 --> 5772.4800000000005
angle well that's literally I guess

5769.48 --> 5774.28
Snell's law that I just verbally

5772.48 --> 5776.919999999999
described I didn't even realize that

5774.28 --> 5778.12
that smells love because

5776.92 --> 5780.76
yeah

5778.12 --> 5784.139
I just like to describe it I just like

5780.76 --> 5784.139
to describe how things work

5784.179 --> 5787.6
because then people actually understand

5786.28 --> 5789.699
it

5787.6 --> 5792.04
if you just shove like oh there's a word

5789.699 --> 5793.599999999999
for that Snow's law and then they might

5792.04 --> 5795.4
look that up and then see all the math

5793.6 --> 5796.719
garbage and then they don't really get

5795.4 --> 5799.0
it as much

5796.719 --> 5800.7390000000005
because they maybe didn't want to have

5799.0 --> 5803.08
all that math garbage shoved in their

5800.739 --> 5805.959999999999
face it might be off pointing to them

5803.08 --> 5808.12
well I will just describe it and then

5805.96 --> 5811.38
there is no objections to actually

5808.12 --> 5811.38
understand it in a moment

5811.54 --> 5814.6
right

5812.98 --> 5817.919999999999
anyway I hope

5814.6 --> 5817.92
I hope that explained

5824.1 --> 5829.320000000001
interviews and discussions with Fe guys

5826.659 --> 5829.32
and gals

5829.9 --> 5832.679
yeah sure

5833.62 --> 5837.639
dude I've been kind of wanting Adam

5835.42 --> 5841.06
making on

5837.639 --> 5843.639
to talk about well his religious

5841.06 --> 5845.4400000000005
research let's just call that research

5843.639 --> 5847.6
about Christ I'd love to talk about that

5845.44 --> 5849.4
more but I think that this error this

5847.6 --> 5852.0
hour is just too early for him is at

5849.4 --> 5852.0
work or something

5855.94 --> 5859.419999999999
right so yeah there's a lot of flat

5857.739 --> 5862.199
earthers

5859.42 --> 5862.1990000000005
but

5863.98 --> 5868.239
I mean

5865.36 --> 5871.299999999999
for the guys I know my show is not

5868.239 --> 5874.419999999999
exactly their time slot

5871.3 --> 5876.88
I mean some of them sometimes pop by

5874.42 --> 5880.36
like Adam making might sometimes pop up

5876.88 --> 5881.9800000000005
Nathan Oakley might sometimes pop up

5880.36 --> 5885.099999999999
but that doesn't mean that they're like

5881.98 --> 5886.36
ready to get in a conversation live with

5885.1 --> 5888.46
me or anything

5886.36 --> 5890.199
so it's just not really a good timing

5888.46 --> 5892.36
for them

5890.199 --> 5895.5599999999995
I would love it too to have them on but

5892.36 --> 5895.5599999999995
it's just not happening

5903.46 --> 5906.06
sorry

5906.94 --> 5910.419999999999
but hey people that do typically follow

5909.1 --> 5913.679
my show

5910.42 --> 5913.679
I could get them on

5915.82 --> 5919.38
like status Moretz the other day

5921.94 --> 5926.919999999999
if anybody here would like to come on

5924.82 --> 5929.679
you can ask me

5926.92 --> 5933.04
don't expect this straight out yes

5929.679 --> 5935.38
but at least I I can consider it think

5933.04 --> 5938.32
about it

5935.38 --> 5939.9400000000005
I mean if I'm gonna have somebody on it

5938.32 --> 5941.5599999999995
would be great to actually have a

5939.94 --> 5944.32
subject to talk about it don't just

5941.56 --> 5946.9800000000005
somebody on there

5944.32 --> 5946.98
so

5947.26 --> 5951.88
if there's like a thing that maybe in

5949.659 --> 5952.659
you consider yourself a specialist at

5951.88 --> 5957.3
that

5952.659 --> 5957.299999999999
I'd love to discuss such things

5957.88 --> 5960.719
verbally

5965.679 --> 5972.1
right or even if you want like a more

5969.219 --> 5973.719
sorry like a one-on-one tutor situation

5972.1 --> 5976.84
like you want to know everything about

5973.719 --> 5978.46
Flat Earth arguments or something

5976.84 --> 5980.62
I can do that I mean that's what I did

5978.46 --> 5982.96
with status Moretz right

5980.62 --> 5985.0
that works very well it works better

5982.96 --> 5987.76
than when I'm just talking to chat

5985.0 --> 5990.82
because I can literally see and hear

5987.76 --> 5993.46
somebody's interactive reaction and then

5990.82 --> 5995.58
attune how I explain things it works

5993.46 --> 5995.58
better

5996.4 --> 5999.0
foreign

6010.139 --> 6013.9800000000005
I mean I would find it entertaining if

6012.659 --> 6016.44
that

6013.98 --> 6018.78
that guy Dan

6016.44 --> 6021.0599999999995
the Dutch guy if he'd come on sometime

6018.78 --> 6022.739
that would be interesting maybe he'd

6021.06 --> 6024.84
find it weird or something here maybe

6022.739 --> 6027.959999999999
he's afraid of that I don't know

6024.84 --> 6029.1
that I mean we basically just

6027.96 --> 6031.5
met

6029.1 --> 6033.120000000001
a few days ago

6031.5 --> 6037.4
but

6033.12 --> 6037.4
I might come on his show sometime

6037.62 --> 6043.86
if he wants me

6040.44 --> 6046.44
it hasn't been warned by David Weiss and

6043.86 --> 6048.659
all that or something against us like

6046.44 --> 6051.178999999999
don't get the flutter Debaters in there

6048.659 --> 6055.099999999999
although he already plays Nathan Oakley

6051.179 --> 6055.1
Clips so probably hasn't happened

6059.88 --> 6065.219
but yeah I'm kind of looking forward to

6062.88 --> 6067.02
getting on that show sometime

6065.219 --> 6071.54
in the near future

6067.02 --> 6071.540000000001
and maybe he'll get on with me too

6075.62 --> 6080.58
if that works out for him I mean he

6078.179 --> 6083.58
might be like in the middle of having it

6080.58 --> 6086.4
doing his job so it doesn't have that

6083.58 --> 6088.739
time available it only really seems to

6086.4 --> 6091.759999999999
actually live stream in the evening so I

6088.739 --> 6091.759999999999
think the guy is working

6093.36 --> 6096.739
it does seem like the type

6102.659 --> 6109.28
right anyway time has flown and I don't

6105.9 --> 6109.28
even know what to call this show

6112.38 --> 6116.42
it was all over the place again

6121.8 --> 6126.4800000000005
I mean it's it's almost at some point it

6123.78 --> 6129.42
becomes kind of a skill to just be so

6126.48 --> 6132.36
over the place subject-wise that you

6129.42 --> 6136.7390000000005
can't even condense it into a title

6132.36 --> 6136.739
anymore just like it becomes like yeah

6137.34 --> 6145.34
that's not a cohesive subject

6142.44 --> 6145.339999999999
doesn't fit

6149.699 --> 6154.699
wise has wound back some of the fantasy

6152.52 --> 6154.6990000000005
stuff

6157.32 --> 6161.28
who knows

6158.76 --> 6164.0
I haven't actually followed him

6161.28 --> 6164.0
for a while

6168.0 --> 6174.48
I did actually answer to like the clock

6171.6 --> 6177.8
moon app thing because it wasn't really

6174.48 --> 6177.799999999999
all that interesting to me anyway

6178.26 --> 6182.46
and that's I don't think he really does

6180.6 --> 6185.6990000000005
any real streams I think he just does

6182.46 --> 6188.159
appearances on all the shows sometimes

6185.699 --> 6190.138999999999
I mean he's still pretty cool when he

6188.159 --> 6193.199
does that I mean he's not like the

6190.139 --> 6194.82
absolute worst Flat Earth

6193.199 --> 6197.28
arguer

6194.82 --> 6200.4
but when it comes to like really going

6197.28 --> 6202.8
up against anti-flat earthers yes he

6200.4 --> 6204.599999999999
does fail at times

6202.8 --> 6207.860000000001
Jesse doesn't

6204.6 --> 6211.76
really adapt to full Flat Earth debate

6207.86 --> 6211.759999999999
spectrum of arguments

6212.46 --> 6215.46
smorgasbord

6223.76 --> 6229.7390000000005
[Music]

6226.5 --> 6230.9
Mark I support that word alone is weird

6229.739 --> 6234.12
but

6230.9 --> 6234.12
[Music]

6236.34 --> 6246.81
maybe I call it Smorgasbord of subjects

6239.15 --> 6246.8099999999995
[Music]

6253.8 --> 6258.54
it is kind of it kind of is it's

6256.679 --> 6261.179
actually kind of funny

6258.54 --> 6264.239
because I did like take something of

6261.179 --> 6266.219
everything and put it in there in today

6264.239 --> 6269.0
talked elaborately about Dark World

6266.219 --> 6269.0
Visions again

6279.239 --> 6286.138999999999
what happened between Nathan and Weiss

6282.86 --> 6289.32
uh but it relates to the whole gerund

6286.139 --> 6293.639
situation calling Nathan a scammer

6289.32 --> 6295.619
and because David Wise well we sort of

6293.639 --> 6297.2390000000005
Nathan thought to have like a sort of

6295.619 --> 6299.839999999999
business arrangement

6297.239 --> 6302.459999999999
with him none paid by the way but

6299.84 --> 6304.5
concerning the the

6302.46 --> 6306.78
Bitcoin challenge

6304.5 --> 6309.42
it was pretty fun at that time he got

6306.78 --> 6312.139
some ballers in here because of that in

6309.42 --> 6312.139
the Flat Earth debates

6312.239 --> 6317.94
but then yeah he basically sided with

6315.9 --> 6321.119
Jaron and everything

6317.94 --> 6323.5199999999995
and later I think the last time was that

6321.119 --> 6325.98
he said in some interview like yeah we

6323.52 --> 6328.38
don't actually follow Flat Earth debates

6325.98 --> 6330.36
he said that in some live interview and

6328.38 --> 6333.0
that was like the last drop and then

6330.36 --> 6336.9
Nathan got really pissed off arguably

6333.0 --> 6338.639
reasonably right it's it's very logical

6336.9 --> 6342.9
it's it's

6338.639 --> 6345.02
because yeah anyway that happened and

6342.9 --> 6347.04
haven't really heard much of it since

6345.02 --> 6349.080000000001
Nathan's been kind of taking another

6347.04 --> 6351.5
Direction and now focusing on well

6349.08 --> 6356.6
reviewing

6351.5 --> 6356.6
Wizards like baller Wizards out there

6360.9 --> 6365.82
so we haven't really focused on like

6363.36 --> 6369.739
glow Busters or anything

6365.82 --> 6369.739
issues with that or even Bev

6371.82 --> 6375.659
because

6373.08 --> 6377.58
yeah that also happened is that pretty

6375.659 --> 6378.9
much first the whole gerund nonsense

6377.58 --> 6381.36
happened

6378.9 --> 6383.179
this is scammer

6381.36 --> 6387.299999999999
and

6383.179 --> 6390.179
then eventually like Bev kind of took

6387.3 --> 6392.04
over the that role you could say he

6390.179 --> 6394.4400000000005
started to talk [ __ ] about letter of

6392.04 --> 6396.84
debates and the arguments

6394.44 --> 6397.799999999999
okay [ __ ] Duo can do [ __ ] all with an

6396.84 --> 6399.92
angle

6397.8 --> 6399.92
Etc

6400.44 --> 6402.98
so

6410.28 --> 6416.099999999999
don't know what he kind of sounds like a

6414.119 --> 6419.36
quotation are you talking about David

6416.1 --> 6419.360000000001
Weiss does he say that

6419.4 --> 6423.48
it's kind of hilarious actually but I

6422.219 --> 6426.92
mean

6423.48 --> 6426.919999999999
why the [ __ ] not

6428.1 --> 6431.96
why couldn't he do that

6435.78 --> 6439.8
you know I mean there's freaking

6437.94 --> 6441.36
companies out there that only pick

6439.8 --> 6445.679
people that are

6441.36 --> 6447.42
like woke and [ __ ] why can't we then say

6445.679 --> 6449.6990000000005
like oh yeah

6447.42 --> 6451.139
okay we'll just take the flat earthers

6449.699 --> 6454.199
then

6451.139 --> 6456.6
I mean I don't see the problem really

6454.199 --> 6460.138999999999
I mean it might be a problem for them if

6456.6 --> 6463.26
they really get cultish with it

6460.139 --> 6465.179
but I mean I'd appreciate having a

6463.26 --> 6466.860000000001
Workforce around me that are all flat

6465.179 --> 6469.9400000000005
earthers that you can count on that I

6466.86 --> 6469.94
really appreciate that

6470.58 --> 6473.84
actually kind of like the idea

6476.58 --> 6483.0
right and why shouldn't a

6480.119 --> 6485.219
a man that's starting a business why

6483.0 --> 6487.5
shouldn't they be able to pick the type

6485.219 --> 6491.4
of people that they

6487.5 --> 6494.659
want and that they see fit for the job I

6491.4 --> 6494.659
mean hello why not

6504.8 --> 6509.820000000001
I mean for me personally I wouldn't mind

6507.6 --> 6512.719
having a couple of Glovers there but

6509.82 --> 6515.219
they would have to be

6512.719 --> 6517.8
haved right that I don't want any

6515.219 --> 6520.5
fanatical Glovers in if I'd had some

6517.8 --> 6521.9400000000005
kind of company or work a job somewhere

6520.5 --> 6524.219
I wouldn't want to have fanatical

6521.94 --> 6526.32
globers around me at all

6524.219 --> 6528.119
because they'd find out about my flat

6526.32 --> 6531.48
Earth and then start bullying me and

6528.119 --> 6532.679
then yeah and that makes it really

6531.48 --> 6535.32
terrible

6532.679 --> 6537.3
to work there then

6535.32 --> 6539.5199999999995
but I wouldn't mind having like Ballers

6537.3 --> 6541.92
like stas morets around me at all

6539.52 --> 6545.9400000000005
because they are very

6541.92 --> 6547.86
good behaved so

6545.94 --> 6549.419999999999
doesn't matter if they believe in the

6547.86 --> 6551.699
globe as long as they're not being

6549.42 --> 6554.639
bastards about it

6551.699 --> 6556.5599999999995
nasty right and then at the same time of

6554.639 --> 6559.9800000000005
course if those people would be working

6556.56 --> 6563.1
alongside me I wouldn't want them to get

6559.98 --> 6565.08
super patronized at by flat earthers

6563.1 --> 6568.619000000001
either

6565.08 --> 6569.94
right that the respect has to come from

6568.619 --> 6571.86
both ways

6569.94 --> 6575.099999999999
for that to work

6571.86 --> 6576.719
but if you can't find that yeah and then

6575.1 --> 6578.52
to say like oh we just want flat

6576.719 --> 6580.199
earthers yeah okay sure if you can't

6578.52 --> 6582.42
find enough people that are flat

6580.199 --> 6585.379999999999
earthers that could do the job

6582.42 --> 6585.38
I mean why not

6585.42 --> 6588.86
I don't have a problem with that

6594.98 --> 6600.239
more divide and conquer

6598.26 --> 6602.6
that's not how you spell conquer but I

6600.239 --> 6602.599999999999
get it

6602.699 --> 6607.259999999999
yeah but

6605.219 --> 6610.219
it's there

6607.26 --> 6610.219
what are you gonna do

6612.3 --> 6618.900000000001
you don't have to bicker about it right

6615.6 --> 6621.0
you don't actually have to do that

6618.9 --> 6623.4
that's the funny thing about it I just

6621.0 --> 6626.04
see it as a as opposing Phyllis

6623.4 --> 6628.759999999999
philosophy in a way

6626.04 --> 6631.38
one based in the actual truth or

6628.76 --> 6634.56
attempting to figure out the truth the

6631.38 --> 6638.82
other based on the monsterable lies but

6634.56 --> 6641.54
with cohesion and benefits so

6638.82 --> 6641.54
I mean

6655.92 --> 6661.38
99 could care less in real life nor ever

6659.46 --> 6663.2390000000005
think about it all right well those

6661.38 --> 6664.8
people wouldn't have any problem then

6663.239 --> 6666.718999999999
saying that

6664.8 --> 6668.219
yeah it's like do you believe the Earth

6666.719 --> 6670.44
is flat

6668.219 --> 6673.679
and they're like

6670.44 --> 6677.5199999999995
yeah it could be that would probably be

6673.679 --> 6677.52
fine then right

6680.46 --> 6684.4800000000005
but if they're going to be like what are

6682.56 --> 6686.400000000001
you crazy well then they probably

6684.48 --> 6688.259999999999
wouldn't even want to work there anymore

6686.4 --> 6690.239
if that were the case and they might

6688.26 --> 6691.639
even go as far so I'm gonna shut this

6690.239 --> 6694.86
[ __ ] down

6691.639 --> 6696.719
you're anti-semitic or some nonsensical

6694.86 --> 6700.0199999999995
accusation or racist or something

6696.719 --> 6701.699
whatever that could happen

6700.02 --> 6704.540000000001
but

6701.699 --> 6704.54
I don't know

6706.86 --> 6712.5599999999995
I don't think it's really something that

6709.739 --> 6714.718999999999
should be focused on a lot

6712.56 --> 6717.360000000001
are they a flat earther or not it's not

6714.719 --> 6720.84
just figure out their behavior

6717.36 --> 6723.0599999999995
and if you're gonna have like blatant

6720.84 --> 6725.88
flat earthers out there then be sure

6723.06 --> 6728.280000000001
that those people that work there

6725.88 --> 6730.02
are prepared for that that they know

6728.28 --> 6731.699
about that that they're not just

6730.02 --> 6733.080000000001
suddenly Gonna Roll into something and

6731.699 --> 6735.719
it's going to turn into a nightmare

6733.08 --> 6739.199
before them because they were absolutely

6735.719 --> 6741.36
not ready to hear about Flat Earth

6739.199 --> 6743.099999999999
right they should definitely have some

6741.36 --> 6745.38
kind of a notice

6743.1 --> 6749.34
at least during the job interview you

6745.38 --> 6752.82
know I mean not necessarily in the ad

6749.34 --> 6755.3
but in the job interview for sure

6752.82 --> 6755.299999999999
anyway

6761.94 --> 6765.919999999999
in the cold mentality format

6773.88 --> 6778.159000000001
well what is you yeah but

6778.32 --> 6781.099999999999
Maybe

6783.06 --> 6787.04
but is it really that control

6789.719 --> 6795.6
I mean in in a way yeah I mean is it to

6793.44 --> 6797.82
get the control back through Flat Earth

6795.6 --> 6799.679
and they're gonna control how how are

6797.82 --> 6800.759999999999
they gonna do that it conflicts with

6799.679 --> 6803.1
everything

6800.76 --> 6805.139
it conflicts with everything else they

6803.1 --> 6806.820000000001
roll out it doesn't fit anymore all

6805.139 --> 6808.619
those things are all in the trash bin

6806.82 --> 6811.92
everything

6808.619 --> 6813.659
the whole all the schemes everything

6811.92 --> 6816.3
so

6813.659 --> 6820.739
how is it a controlled release I mean

6816.3 --> 6823.38
at best it's like a damage controlled

6820.739 --> 6825.9
release right it's damage control they

6823.38 --> 6830.2390000000005
release it so that

6825.9 --> 6830.239
it doesn't like totally blow up

6836.52 --> 6842.280000000001
because it was going to spread Internet

6839.699 --> 6844.638999999999
it's the internet age it was gonna

6842.28 --> 6844.639
happen

6847.08 --> 6853.08
so if you then roll it out you can

6851.34 --> 6858.679
well yeah

6853.08 --> 6858.679
contain it a bit and I redirect people

6863.82 --> 6868.0199999999995
so it's more damage control like the

6865.92 --> 6870.0
whole release supposed to control the

6868.02 --> 6873.7390000000005
oppositional release

6870.0 --> 6873.739
its damage control

6874.86 --> 6881.699
it's not to take control of Flat Earth

6878.76 --> 6885.119000000001
because that's absolutely impossible and

6881.699 --> 6886.32
they can never integrate it it cannot

6885.119 --> 6889.98
work

6886.32 --> 6892.199
you can't mainstream it it's impossible

6889.98 --> 6894.799999999999
look at all the narratives that carry

6892.199 --> 6899.28
all that weight all that money it's

6894.8 --> 6902.28
absolutely impossible without all of

6899.28 --> 6903.9
that all completely going down the drain

6902.28 --> 6906.8
forever

6903.9 --> 6906.799999999999
do you see that

6906.96 --> 6913.639
they can't take control of it and then

6909.9 --> 6913.638999999999
reintegrate it's impossible

6915.32 --> 6920.88
not without blowing up everything that

6918.06 --> 6923.820000000001
they've built all the scams oh climate

6920.88 --> 6928.1
change all the medical industrial

6923.82 --> 6928.099999999999
complex crap all of it

6930.719 --> 6937.76
it's all based on heliocentric lore all

6934.32 --> 6942.139
of it the whole medical situation

6937.76 --> 6942.139
inoculation all based on

6942.44 --> 6949.199
heliocentric originated lore evolution

6946.44 --> 6951.839999999999
all that it's all based on that all of

6949.199 --> 6955.82
it the climate change is all based on

6951.84 --> 6955.82
that nonsense premise all of it

6956.639 --> 6962.76
they can't integrate it they can't take

6960.239 --> 6966.78
control over it they can only control

6962.76 --> 6969.900000000001
how much damage the exposure of it does

6966.78 --> 6971.46
because it was going to be exposed the

6969.9 --> 6974.9
internet is there it's not you could

6971.46 --> 6974.9
they can't really stop it

6976.5 --> 6983.0
and they cannot integrate it not in the

6979.92 --> 6986.04
way things are going not in this hostile

6983.0 --> 6988.44
Imperial takeover

6986.04 --> 6991.76
because it counter opposes everything

6988.44 --> 6991.759999999999
they do with it

6993.659 --> 6998.239
takes the bottom out of everything for

6996.0 --> 6998.239
them

7004.1 --> 7008.5
yes George Sanford heard about that

7014.36 --> 7017.96
right but I'm gonna round out the show

7016.4 --> 7021.099999999999
though

7017.96 --> 7021.1
that was interesting

7024.199 --> 7029.839999999999
but I really hope you you yeah you take

7027.199 --> 7032.0199999999995
the heart and mind what I just said I

7029.84 --> 7032.02
mean

7032.179 --> 7037.219
you can't just control everything

7035.46 --> 7040.639
[Music]

7037.219 --> 7043.099
right I mean

7040.639 --> 7046.46
they would have to make a maneuver that

7043.099 --> 7048.9800000000005
would equal how the Council of nicaea

7046.46 --> 7051.199
how they've written the Bible basically

7048.98 --> 7053.799999999999
contradicting Christ's teachings within

7051.199 --> 7053.799999999999
the very book

7054.88 --> 7060.56
yeah they would have to do something

7057.92 --> 7062.78
like that well what is that that's

7060.56 --> 7066.139
creating a religion

7062.78 --> 7068.42
well that's a pretty pretty big damn

7066.139 --> 7071.78
transition movement that comes with

7068.42 --> 7075.4400000000005
Imperial territory marking like the

7071.78 --> 7079.5199999999995
theocracy did right so unless they want

7075.44 --> 7082.239
to do that with flat earth like what how

7079.52 --> 7085.52
the hell would that that would be such a

7082.239 --> 7087.86
gigantic in your face sudden transition

7085.52 --> 7091.219
that everybody would be thinking what's

7087.86 --> 7093.38
going on here no that's way

7091.219 --> 7095.2390000000005
too dramatic

7093.38 --> 7097.639
to accomplish that

7095.239 --> 7099.44
so the Flat Earth is just is not

7097.639 --> 7102.7390000000005
compatible

7099.44 --> 7105.919999999999
with the way the machine is rolling

7102.739 --> 7109.098999999999
things out what it is using where it is

7105.92 --> 7110.06
focusing finances on it can't work with

7109.099 --> 7112.900000000001
flat

7110.06 --> 7112.900000000001
flat compatible

7119.42 --> 7123.4400000000005
fight against the control heart ranking

7121.58 --> 7126.26
sorry did it have dude steamy traveler

7123.44 --> 7128.719
that that does actually happen

7126.26 --> 7131.2390000000005
it's just that a lot of them are not

7128.719 --> 7133.04
immediately jumping to Media with it

7131.239 --> 7134.48
because their life could be potentially

7133.04 --> 7136.88
over

7134.48 --> 7139.36
but there is even in the Beast system

7136.88 --> 7141.86
there are people that Engineers

7139.36 --> 7144.139
scientists if you say but mostly just

7141.86 --> 7146.0
think of it as engineers and

7144.139 --> 7148.179
planners and all that

7146.0 --> 7151.34
architects

7148.179 --> 7154.28
brainstormers Think Tank people

7151.34 --> 7156.08
they a lot of them have as they're doing

7154.28 --> 7157.159
it figure it out like wait this is

7156.08 --> 7159.679
actually

7157.159 --> 7161.42
bad news like oh they thought at first

7159.679 --> 7164.119
like oh we're just gonna be the cons

7161.42 --> 7165.9800000000005
like we can get this but now they're

7164.119 --> 7167.54
figuring out like wait this is totally

7165.98 --> 7169.58
going out of hand like this is not

7167.54 --> 7171.619
controllable we're gonna end up dead

7169.58 --> 7174.679
like this

7171.619 --> 7176.9
and they will kind of sit in their place

7174.679 --> 7179.4800000000005
and

7176.9 --> 7182.48
try to convince others to basically

7179.48 --> 7184.0
alter direction right so that bet

7182.48 --> 7187.04
there's plenty of

7184.0 --> 7188.599
scientists and Engineers that try to

7187.04 --> 7190.82
expose the truth

7188.599 --> 7193.159000000001
from within

7190.82 --> 7195.4
they're just not going public with it

7193.159 --> 7198.379999999999
because then they get the entire media

7195.4 --> 7200.5599999999995
circus after them and their life will be

7198.38 --> 7200.56
over

7201.619 --> 7206.78
there's only a few that actually try to

7204.139 --> 7209.179
risk that and they

7206.78 --> 7211.28
tend to then get into little friend

7209.179 --> 7214.099
groups

7211.28 --> 7215.659
media friend groups you know you can see

7214.099 --> 7217.6990000000005
them all out there like Alex Jones is

7215.659 --> 7219.5599999999995
typically one of those guys it's like a

7217.699 --> 7223.098999999999
media

7219.56 --> 7225.139
friend group guy all about the

7223.099 --> 7228.26
connections all those people that have

7225.139 --> 7230.0
actually become media figures in leaking

7228.26 --> 7232.04
and all that right but that's another

7230.0 --> 7235.28
life that is

7232.04 --> 7237.5
the life before that is over

7235.28 --> 7239.42
they're now public figures doing that

7237.5 --> 7240.92
and they got all the negative attention

7239.42 --> 7242.9
too

7240.92 --> 7244.76
from the Beast system going after them

7242.9 --> 7247.46
so

7244.76 --> 7249.679
you're not gonna see

7247.46 --> 7251.42
you're only going to see a fraction of

7249.679 --> 7254.06
the people

7251.42 --> 7255.92
that are trying to stop this all from

7254.06 --> 7260.5
happening actually

7255.92 --> 7260.5
getting out and open in the media

7267.739 --> 7274.159
but I mean you got to be completely

7270.52 --> 7275.900000000001
suicidal and insane to be fully on board

7274.159 --> 7278.32
with some of this [ __ ] that's rolling

7275.9 --> 7278.32
out now

7278.54 --> 7284.48
you got to be actually insane

7281.9 --> 7286.638999999999
right but people still have jobs and

7284.48 --> 7288.379999999999
they have plans in their life and so

7286.639 --> 7292.6990000000005
when they figured it out that what's

7288.38 --> 7294.82
going on they can't just quit a lot of

7292.699 --> 7294.82
them

7296.42 --> 7300.08
so they're trying to figure out how to

7298.4 --> 7303.4
alter

7300.08 --> 7303.4
how things will roll up

7306.199 --> 7310.94
or plan another life

7309.26 --> 7312.320000000001
which takes some time I mean if you

7310.94 --> 7314.239
figure out like this entire thing you

7312.32 --> 7316.099
counted on and like the expenses and

7314.239 --> 7317.598999999999
everything and then it's like oh it's

7316.099 --> 7319.82
totally [ __ ] and I'm probably gonna

7317.599 --> 7321.679
end up in jail if I continue here yeah

7319.82 --> 7324.259999999999
that takes a lot of time you have to

7321.679 --> 7327.02
unwind everything re-plan everything

7324.26 --> 7330.08
into another life that you can't just do

7327.02 --> 7333.320000000001
that from one day to the other

7330.08 --> 7335.42
and you gotta keep

7333.32 --> 7337.94
preventing from getting suddenly fired

7335.42 --> 7340.159
and a bad reputation too so

7337.94 --> 7342.98
all these things are a little bit more

7340.159 --> 7347.32
complicated than people that are typical

7342.98 --> 7347.32
truthers online tend to think they are

7350.84 --> 7355.9400000000005
controllers allow Fe channels at all

7352.76 --> 7359.599
because if they didn't

7355.94 --> 7362.9
then the morale would become even worse

7359.599 --> 7365.7390000000005
Fe channels are a steam vent

7362.9 --> 7365.739
for people

7365.96 --> 7369.8
too you know

7367.46 --> 7371.78
if you can't even speak the truth

7369.8 --> 7373.88
anymore like that then they will truly

7371.78 --> 7376.42
feel like they're in a Nazi regime more

7373.88 --> 7376.42
than ever before

7378.5 --> 7382.76
and

7380.659 --> 7387.08
well that's kind of happening out there

7382.76 --> 7389.780000000001
even with like regular politics so

7387.08 --> 7391.699
but I mean they don't really like go

7389.78 --> 7394.099
after flat earthers but I mean flat

7391.699 --> 7397.699
earthers are not getting like they're

7394.099 --> 7400.04
getting down demoted like when it comes

7397.699 --> 7401.9
to algorithmic treatment so there's no

7400.04 --> 7406.36
really big flat earthers because of that

7401.9 --> 7406.36
on YouTube or pretty much anywhere

7407.239 --> 7411.32
so they just choose to

7409.46 --> 7414.32
do it like that

7411.32 --> 7416.239
to just kind of like keep it silent

7414.32 --> 7418.759999999999
shove them in a corner digitally without

7416.239 --> 7421.9
people realizing it and that's how they

7418.76 --> 7421.900000000001
try to keep a lid on it

7422.3 --> 7427.6990000000005
dude it might be that they just can't

7425.659 --> 7431.119
straight out assault it like that

7427.699 --> 7434.919999999999
because it's actually like a thousand

7431.119 --> 7434.92
times bigger than we even realize

7436.76 --> 7442.76
it might actually be a lot wider spread

7440.48 --> 7444.799999999999
than we even realize it we might

7442.76 --> 7446.0
actually be already at the point of

7444.8 --> 7448.179
majority

7446.0 --> 7450.679
it's just that because of the

7448.179 --> 7452.719
communication compartmentalization we

7450.679 --> 7455.08
don't get to see

7452.719 --> 7455.08
yeah

7455.36 --> 7462.5199999999995
right

7457.58 --> 7462.5199999999995
don't know not for sure we don't know

7474.02 --> 7477.9800000000005
foreign

7474.98 --> 7477.98
whatever

7479.3 --> 7483.099
turn me into symmetic now

7488.179 --> 7491.599
right anyway but I'm gonna round out the

7490.159 --> 7494.42
show guys

7491.599 --> 7497.179

7494.42 --> 7499.76
but yeah interesting I'm gonna have a

7497.179 --> 7502.78
