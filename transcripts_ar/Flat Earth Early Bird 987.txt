a little short on sleep actually

190.159 --> 192.79999999999998
because of it

193.44 --> 198.4
i did put my alarm clock back an hour

234.799 --> 238.92000000000002
yesterday was good

240.0 --> 244.239
was there in the beginning of the live

242.159 --> 247.2
show and

244.239 --> 250.239
yeah the after show

247.2 --> 251.72
that's when i came back from groceries

250.239 --> 253.36
so yeah it was interesting

251.72 --> 255.84
[Music]

253.36 --> 258.23900000000003
uh

255.84 --> 259.919
lots of other shows yeah i actually hung

258.239 --> 261.75899999999996
around at brandon's

259.919 --> 263.919
chat

261.759 --> 266.56
for like the first half of the show was

263.919 --> 268.71999999999997
interesting because

266.56 --> 270.639
it basically shoving

268.72 --> 273.44000000000005
dali

270.639 --> 275.6
paintings in her face

273.44 --> 278.08
which yeah it's very fascinating to

275.6 --> 278.08000000000004
analyze

278.479 --> 283.199
also try to get into the

281.199 --> 285.28000000000003
live show through

283.199 --> 286.40000000000003
discord a bit

285.28 --> 289.19899999999996
but

286.4 --> 289.19899999999996
yeah i didn't

289.6 --> 293.36
didn't really say much i eventually just

292.08 --> 296.35999999999996
left again

293.36 --> 296.36
uh

296.96 --> 301.28
right also

299.12 --> 303.12
oh benjamin

301.28 --> 305.19899999999996
watch the stream brave new world of

303.12 --> 308.08
gammas

305.199 --> 310.72
that was interesting

308.08 --> 313.28
uh

310.72 --> 314.639
also yeah what something completely did

313.28 --> 317.59999999999997
another

314.639 --> 319.12
historical documentary about the druids

317.6 --> 321.6
again

319.12 --> 325.52
the druids and the romans and

321.6 --> 328.0
this is like the third like historically

325.52 --> 330.15999999999997
based research

328.0 --> 333.28
documentary i've seen about that on

330.16 --> 335.28000000000003
youtube from different people

333.28 --> 337.11999999999995
and the more i watch of these

335.28 --> 340.88
documentaries the more i can conclude

337.12 --> 344.8
like yeah the freaking romans

340.88 --> 347.039
like they totally slandered them

344.8 --> 348.8
like totally

347.039 --> 350.4
just

348.8 --> 351.44
made up

350.4 --> 353.75899999999996
crazy

351.44 --> 356.4
dark stories about them

353.759 --> 356.40000000000003
for sure

357.44 --> 361.36
like that really stood out and it's

359.52 --> 365.19899999999996
funny how those

361.36 --> 365.199
things are even echoed

365.52 --> 370.639
to this day sometimes by some people

368.0 --> 374.88
because of rumors

370.639 --> 376.639
that freaking ro made about the druids

374.88 --> 378.15999999999997
like pure rumors

376.639 --> 380.24
and then like

378.16 --> 382.47900000000004
in retrospect all the historical

380.24 --> 385.039
evidence and artifacts that were found

382.479 --> 388.71999999999997
like it just doesn't prove

385.039 --> 390.15999999999997
those notions at all and i just

388.72 --> 392.56
like

390.16 --> 394.319
the first time i saw that it's like

392.56 --> 396.4
is it being put in a certain light or

394.319 --> 398.56
something but like this is now the third

396.4 --> 399.04999999999995
one i've watched in like the last five

398.56 --> 400.319
years and

399.05 --> 402.8
[Music]

400.319 --> 405.36
every time

402.8 --> 407.12
it just goes to show like the romans

405.36 --> 408.8
were

407.12 --> 409.919
an empire

408.8 --> 411.28000000000003
and

409.919 --> 413.599
gammas

411.28 --> 415.35999999999996
like just look at the freaking statues

413.599 --> 418.15999999999997
of these romans

415.36 --> 420.84000000000003
they were gammas

418.16 --> 424.24
and gammas slander to

420.84 --> 428.0
conquer and that's what they tried

424.24 --> 430.479
basically same story story types as we

428.0 --> 433.039
get in the modern day

430.479 --> 435.36
just the people they want they want the

433.039 --> 437.36
territory they want assimilate it and

435.36 --> 439.199
then they slander

437.36 --> 440.16
the people that are spiritually in

439.199 --> 443.36
charge

440.16 --> 443.36
which were the druids

443.52 --> 446.88
and yeah it's just interesting

448.4 --> 454.44
anyway hello good servant agm dusty

451.44 --> 454.44
ryder

466.639 --> 469.039
all right

469.599 --> 475.199
other than that

471.919 --> 478.19899999999996
just gonna be gaming

475.199 --> 478.199
and

481.68 --> 487.28000000000003
like keeping track of alex jones a

484.479 --> 487.28
little and

488.16 --> 492.96000000000004
just seeing like how he is

490.639 --> 496.639
processing

492.96 --> 498.71999999999997
the afghanistan situation

496.639 --> 503.84000000000003
with his clear

498.72 --> 505.91900000000004
long-term predisposition against islam

503.84 --> 508.56
that's his narrative choice and i'm just

505.919 --> 510.31899999999996
trying to see like

508.56 --> 514.399
how is he working through that because i

510.319 --> 515.279
do realize or i think

514.399 --> 519.959
that

515.279 --> 519.959
so much information has come afloat

520.24 --> 525.2
that even he should know and he has

523.12 --> 527.839
given us signs that he understands like

525.2 --> 527.839
yeah this is

527.92 --> 532.7199999999999
you can't really blame islam for any of

530.48 --> 532.72
that

533.12 --> 537.6
anyway

534.399 --> 540.32
especially if he or one of his staff has

537.6 --> 543.279
been following owen benjamin halfway

540.32 --> 547.2
then they should definitely know

543.279 --> 547.2
all right but i like to keep track

547.44 --> 550.8800000000001
how far back

549.2 --> 554.72
are the first

550.88 --> 554.72
druids recorded but

558.64 --> 561.64
i

564.48 --> 567.12
i don't know

567.519 --> 572.24
i think the first recorded ones were

570.24 --> 574.5600000000001
through romans and

572.24 --> 577.36
well those romans did start out with

574.56 --> 579.5999999999999
bunch of slanderous rumors

577.36 --> 579.6
so

580.56 --> 584.3199999999999
i think

581.68 --> 585.92
basically during the time of caesar he

584.32 --> 587.36
was one of the first

585.92 --> 591.4799999999999
to

587.36 --> 591.48
like around that period

591.68 --> 596.959
to basically record them to officially

595.04 --> 601.1999999999999
make note of them and it's not

596.959 --> 602.8
surprising too because they were like

601.2 --> 604.9590000000001
kind of secretive

602.8 --> 608.7199999999999
in many ways not just about their habits

604.959 --> 608.7199999999999
but even about their existence

609.04 --> 613.8389999999999
they were not like superstars of their

611.519 --> 617.279
time no they were kind of

613.839 --> 619.6800000000001
reclusive in many ways

617.279 --> 622.0
uh

619.68 --> 623.8389999999999
even though they say stone oh that's

622.0 --> 626.72
funny that you mention it yeah yeah

623.839 --> 630.0790000000001
stonehenge and the druids are just

626.72 --> 630.0790000000001
completely unrelated

630.399 --> 635.839
the idea that it's some ritual thing of

633.12 --> 639.2
the druids is nonsense

635.839 --> 641.519
there's no evidence for this at all

639.2 --> 644.1600000000001
and there's even suspicions that

641.519 --> 645.279
stonehenge was actually built much much

644.16 --> 648.88
later

645.279 --> 651.6
during the industrialization

648.88 --> 651.6
it's weird

653.279 --> 658.72
right that that's not woven into druid

656.24 --> 662.72
documentaries but there's just no proof

658.72 --> 665.2
tying those together at all

662.72 --> 665.2
anyway

670.16 --> 675.279
what the plane taking off in afghanistan

672.8 --> 678.3199999999999
was mostly giant balloon what

675.279 --> 678.32
are you talking about

680.079 --> 684.16
hello pj krishan good to see you

684.959 --> 689.8389999999999
yeah brandon's was funny

687.44 --> 689.839
i know

702.399 --> 706.56
i don't know about any blimps taking off

704.8 --> 709.12
in afghanistan i don't know where you're

706.56 --> 709.1199999999999
getting that

711.519 --> 714.399
like those big

714.959 --> 720.16
aircraft carriers are just really bl

718.639 --> 723.04
really big

720.16 --> 727.639
i don't see them as blimps

723.04 --> 727.639
they're just really really big

736.399 --> 739.839
should you send a link sure

741.519 --> 744.76
why not

746.959 --> 750.8
all right

748.079 --> 753.12
also i've been hearing more and more

750.8 --> 755.5999999999999
remote signs

753.12 --> 757.0600000000001
and this is really kind of unexpected

755.6 --> 760.1700000000001
even

757.06 --> 760.17
[Music]

762.72 --> 766.88
just for their doing

764.88 --> 768.16
and not just

766.88 --> 770.88
like

768.16 --> 773.12
brutally slaughtering everybody

770.88 --> 776.32
as i guess they have done before in the

773.12 --> 779.36
past like that's standing out to me like

776.32 --> 782.0
all these videos all the videos well

779.36 --> 783.76
guess what all those types of videos the

782.0 --> 785.68
first thing that's going to happen is

783.76 --> 789.519
they're going to be shown or linked to

785.68 --> 793.04
on alex jones because of course

789.519 --> 796.16
muslims are bad right he does that

793.04 --> 797.12
i haven't seen any like any

796.16 --> 801.48
have you

797.12 --> 801.48
have you seen like any serious

802.56 --> 805.76
like

803.519 --> 808.079
massive slaughters or anything

805.76 --> 810.639
yeah people being riled up or corralled

808.079 --> 810.6389999999999
and [ __ ]

811.04 --> 815.24
but other than that

815.519 --> 821.04
i don't know maybe it just

818.72 --> 823.36
stayed out of reach i don't know it's

821.04 --> 823.36
weird

825.68 --> 828.68
okay

835.8 --> 841.56
inflatable plane

838.56 --> 841.56
okay

847.92 --> 850.24
what

854.399 --> 857.839
i don't get it

867.6 --> 873.279
sounds like somebody just made up it's

870.16 --> 873.279
an inflatable plane

873.44 --> 876.44
really

910.079 --> 913.56
no wheels

913.76 --> 916.76
really

933.68 --> 939.56
okay let me check again

935.92 --> 939.56
damn it come on

948.24 --> 950.48
uh

952.72 --> 955.72
no

955.92 --> 959.12
there are wheels

959.759 --> 964.8000000000001
it's just people in front of them

962.56 --> 966.16
like seriously guys what do you mean no

964.8 --> 968.959
wheels

966.16 --> 971.8389999999999
there's people running in front of it

968.959 --> 971.8389999999999
what do you expect

975.759 --> 978.8000000000001
this is ridiculous

980.16 --> 986.3199999999999
like you can literally at the front even

982.48 --> 989.12
like see people trying to climb on

986.32 --> 990.8000000000001
on the wheel gear

989.12 --> 993.44
like what do you think they're climbing

990.8 --> 994.959
onto like underneath that plane this

993.44 --> 999.759
makes no sense

994.959 --> 999.7589999999999
this is conspiracy squirting seriously

1005.68 --> 1011.5999999999999
yeah inflatable tanks yeah but those

1008.0 --> 1013.839
were actually just props sitting there

1011.6 --> 1016.16
to look at at a distance

1013.839 --> 1018.8800000000001
they didn't use them

1016.16 --> 1022.079
to drive in some well maybe they

1018.88 --> 1022.8
actually did but that's visual ops this

1022.079 --> 1024.559
is

1022.8 --> 1026.959
no

1024.559 --> 1028.559
makes no freaking sense

1026.959 --> 1031.1200000000001
like why

1028.559 --> 1034.6
why would they do that

1031.12 --> 1034.6
why would they

1041.6 --> 1044.8799999999999
and the windows

1048.079 --> 1050.0
well

1049.039 --> 1051.919
ever

1050.0 --> 1054.16
considered that maybe the windows were

1051.919 --> 1057.8400000000001
just blackened

1054.16 --> 1057.8400000000001
not transparent windows

1059.12 --> 1064.4799999999998
i mean what do you need you need the

1060.96 --> 1067.8400000000001
pilot while liftoff opening up a window

1064.48 --> 1067.84
and hello i mean

1068.559 --> 1071.559
guys

1082.559 --> 1087.36
i mean if you really seriously want to

1085.039 --> 1091.039
utter such a concept

1087.36 --> 1095.84
then literally put it next to one of

1091.039 --> 1095.84
those airplane models in another shot

1096.799 --> 1101.2
right are there like

1099.039 --> 1103.28
differences that are completely out of

1101.2 --> 1105.28
place like are the windows just

1103.28 --> 1109.9189999999999
completely different because it makes no

1105.28 --> 1114.84
sense to modify a huge plane like that

1109.919 --> 1114.8400000000001
for no apparent reason so

1128.16 --> 1132.48
you don't see in the front of the wheel

1130.559 --> 1134.32
yep there's people

1132.48 --> 1138.4
walking

1134.32 --> 1141.2
around it you see you even see somebody

1138.4 --> 1145.8400000000001
climbing onto it what you think they're

1141.2 --> 1145.8400000000001
climbing onto somebody else's shoulder

1146.16 --> 1150.48
when those people are actually running

1148.4 --> 1151.76
you think that is happening

1150.48 --> 1153.919
no

1151.76 --> 1155.76
no it's there it's just people walking

1153.919 --> 1157.1200000000001
in front of it look

1155.76 --> 1161.4
carefully

1157.12 --> 1161.3999999999999
somebody's climbing on it

1164.72 --> 1168.72
it looked like it was being pulled

1177.44 --> 1179.76
hey

1191.44 --> 1195.919
911 on the side of the plane that is

1193.52 --> 1198.559
just oh well that might be real right

1195.919 --> 1201.3600000000001
that doesn't mean it's a fake plane

1198.559 --> 1204.72
could mean that they just put it there

1201.36 --> 1207.76
specifically for the association

1204.72 --> 1209.44
right to make people squirt

1207.76 --> 1212.559
and tremble

1209.44 --> 1216.0
like oh no it's 9 11 allure again yeah

1212.559 --> 1216.0
that's why they would do that

1218.159 --> 1223.919
when you see the number 911 you know

1220.559 --> 1226.24
it's a psyop what

1223.919 --> 1226.24
what

1230.64 --> 1234.3600000000001
oh my god

1238.96 --> 1241.3600000000001
guys

1246.08 --> 1253.6789999999999
why are you so desperate

1249.36 --> 1255.6789999999999
why are you so desperate

1253.679 --> 1258.0800000000002
to see this

1255.679 --> 1260.3200000000002
like what does it even freaking matter

1258.08 --> 1263.28
the engines were empty

1260.32 --> 1265.48
what the hell

1263.28 --> 1269.2
it's just interesting oh you mean

1265.48 --> 1271.2
distracting into nonsense that doesn't

1269.2 --> 1273.679
really matter

1271.2 --> 1279.48
you mean that

1273.679 --> 1279.48
yeah yeah that it did for sure

1292.72 --> 1297.52
let's just talk about the engines being

1295.12 --> 1297.52
empty

1300.48 --> 1303.48
what

1307.2 --> 1312.559
hmm

1309.039 --> 1312.559
that does look a bit odd though

1317.36 --> 1322.7199999999998
right i understand like you're used to

1320.159 --> 1325.44
like in engines like that always at sea

1322.72 --> 1327.679
at least see the rotors

1325.44 --> 1327.679
but

1329.679 --> 1337.919
unless it's not that type of engine

1333.84 --> 1341.9189999999999
dude it's very simple compare it to the

1337.919 --> 1343.919
design of this plane compare it to the

1341.919 --> 1347.3600000000001
design of this plane

1343.919 --> 1349.76
take a shot of that plane design

1347.36 --> 1352.32
and compare it

1349.76 --> 1354.24
does it look completely off are there

1352.32 --> 1357.4399999999998
distinct differences that would make

1354.24 --> 1358.559
absolutely no sense then i'll go halfway

1357.44 --> 1362.72
with you

1358.559 --> 1362.72
but just staring at this footage

1363.6 --> 1369.52
and number 911 no sorry

1366.4 --> 1369.52
it doesn't do it for me

1370.96 --> 1375.52
yeah but the thing is you should have

1373.039 --> 1378.32
actually figured that out yourself and

1375.52 --> 1379.6
done that first

1378.32 --> 1381.28
right

1379.6 --> 1384.32
in all honesty

1381.28 --> 1385.28
any video suggesting it's a fake plane

1384.32 --> 1388.48
should

1385.28 --> 1392.08
have done that

1388.48 --> 1394.08
it's bizarre it's suspicious it's not

1392.08 --> 1397.6399999999999
already in there

1394.08 --> 1397.6399999999999
that's suspicious

1405.28 --> 1410.48
the pig of all people inside the what

1409.36 --> 1414.76
this is

1410.48 --> 1414.76
okay this is getting really annoying

1416.08 --> 1421.9189999999999
you stop squirting over your perceived

1418.96 --> 1425.679
fakeness conspiracy and actually

1421.919 --> 1428.8400000000001
do do some critical research

1425.679 --> 1431.679
complete comparing the plane design

1428.84 --> 1436.0
right now if there is something

1431.679 --> 1436.0
distinctly off get back to me

1436.72 --> 1441.84
get i can't can i get a link what do you

1439.2 --> 1445.8400000000001
mean a link

1441.84 --> 1445.84
adm already put out the link in chat

1448.32 --> 1452.08
shut up bad karma

1450.48 --> 1455.08
you're not gonna get involved in this

1452.08 --> 1455.08
[ __ ]

1460.48 --> 1464.72
you have seen a side by side where

1466.08 --> 1469.96
where have you seen that

1480.48 --> 1486.24
right and hey in all fairness yes i had

1483.679 --> 1487.919
when i first saw that footage i did have

1486.24 --> 1490.64
a feeling like there's something weird

1487.919 --> 1493.5200000000002
about this plane all right

1490.64 --> 1494.7990000000002
yeah i have that sensation a feeling

1493.52 --> 1498.32
about it

1494.799 --> 1501.52
like there's something weird about this

1498.32 --> 1503.84
that doesn't mean it's like not a real

1501.52 --> 1503.84
plane

1504.64 --> 1509.679
it's just something weird about it

1507.6 --> 1511.84
maybe it was actually a real plane and

1509.679 --> 1515.039
they cgi'd a bunch of things over it

1511.84 --> 1517.36
ever considered that

1515.039 --> 1517.36
you know

1518.799 --> 1524.0
maybe they pasted the 911 over there

1522.08 --> 1526.08
like literally it wasn't on there and

1524.0 --> 1529.84
they pasted it on there for dramatic

1526.08 --> 1529.84
effect maybe that is the thing

1530.4 --> 1532.72
you know

1534.48 --> 1537.44
yeah that will be easier

1536.72 --> 1540.48
like

1537.44 --> 1544.0800000000002
dude there's people climbing on the side

1540.48 --> 1548.64
and [ __ ] like how are you gonna

1544.08 --> 1551.6399999999999
cgi a plane into that whole thing

1548.64 --> 1551.64
just

1556.96 --> 1561.3600000000001
ah dude

1558.4 --> 1564.159
okay okay let me try to

1561.36 --> 1566.32
try to make it just slightly more

1564.159 --> 1568.96
realistic okay

1566.32 --> 1570.96
maybe it wasn't a real plane in a way

1568.96 --> 1573.1200000000001
maybe it was like a

1570.96 --> 1575.279
downgraded

1573.12 --> 1580.1589999999999
prop plane that could fly

1575.279 --> 1583.279
maybe they had kind of expected hoped

1580.159 --> 1585.0390000000002
that it would be blown up or something

1583.279 --> 1586.799
right maybe they just told the taliban

1585.039 --> 1587.919
like oh yeah there's like we're all

1586.799 --> 1590.32
gonna

1587.919 --> 1591.679
evacuate all the gays they're really

1590.32 --> 1594.24
really gays

1591.679 --> 1595.919
through this airplane and then they hope

1594.24 --> 1599.36
that the taliban would shoot it out of

1595.919 --> 1602.3200000000002
the air or something right maybe that's

1599.36 --> 1602.32
what's going on

1602.559 --> 1608.08
you know how

1603.919 --> 1609.76
the u.s empire loves to set them up

1608.08 --> 1611.84
they love that

1609.76 --> 1614.4
right so maybe that

1611.84 --> 1614.3999999999999
is a thing

1614.799 --> 1619.52
but to say it like no it's just

1617.279 --> 1622.0
completely different

1619.52 --> 1622.0
i don't know

1625.44 --> 1628.4
what's that agent

1634.88 --> 1638.6000000000001
that's the same video

1652.32 --> 1655.32
oh

1658.32 --> 1660.96
no

1661.12 --> 1667.76
no yo i just checked very carefully

1665.679 --> 1671.76
at the

1667.76 --> 1674.559
one minute 49 second mark of that video

1671.76 --> 1677.44
those windows are not painted on they

1674.559 --> 1680.08
are actually transparent you could see

1677.44 --> 1682.64
very very slightly through them you

1680.08 --> 1685.039
could just see like

1682.64 --> 1687.919
color change behind it no i i don't

1685.039 --> 1687.919
think this is fake

1689.2 --> 1693.88
modified maybe

1690.88 --> 1693.88
fake

1704.559 --> 1708.799
it's also by the way standing out how

1707.12 --> 1712.32
grainy

1708.799 --> 1712.32
the video quality is

1713.039 --> 1718.32
anybody notice that like what is this

1716.64 --> 1722.159
like

1718.32 --> 1725.84
480 resolution or something it's crappy

1722.159 --> 1725.8400000000001
it's really crappy

1740.559 --> 1746.399
afghan phones

1743.279 --> 1750.679
yeah but it is very convenient isn't it

1746.399 --> 1750.6789999999999
rocket blimps it's very convenient

1754.24 --> 1757.24
um

1766.64 --> 1772.159
but yeah if there is some kind of a

1769.279 --> 1774.48
weirdness conspiracy going on with that

1772.159 --> 1776.48
then i think that it was an attempt to

1774.48 --> 1779.44
kind of lord

1776.48 --> 1781.76
the taliban to attack the plane i think

1779.44 --> 1784.0800000000002
that's what they wanted with this and it

1781.76 --> 1787.2
just didn't work out instead they

1784.08 --> 1789.76
followed the weird afghani tradition

1787.2 --> 1791.76
of basically walking and running with a

1789.76 --> 1794.72
plane

1791.76 --> 1797.679
as it takes off there's other

1794.72 --> 1799.2
people by the way that also do that

1797.679 --> 1801.679
was it like in

1799.2 --> 1804.48
chile or something what was it

1801.679 --> 1807.44
there's a couple of tribes that

1804.48 --> 1809.919
have been historically recorded doing

1807.44 --> 1811.679
that when there was a plane and somebody

1809.919 --> 1813.8400000000001
would take off that they would all start

1811.679 --> 1816.799
running with the plane

1813.84 --> 1820.32
as if they would help it lift off

1816.799 --> 1824.1589999999999
and the afghans do that too

1820.32 --> 1824.1589999999999
or at least well they did it here

1826.88 --> 1831.679
right and they don't look like oh we're

1829.12 --> 1834.8799999999999
gonna we're gonna trash this plane no

1831.679 --> 1836.5590000000002
they're like yay they're going

1834.88 --> 1838.88
like the guys that are running around

1836.559 --> 1841.52
these planes they don't look grim

1838.88 --> 1844.5200000000002
they kind of look happy

1841.52 --> 1844.52
right

1864.0 --> 1869.36
we don't even know it's from the oh

1866.799 --> 1872.0
that's a good one return to normal

1869.36 --> 1875.36
you're you're right

1872.0 --> 1875.36
i don't know when it was shot

1875.44 --> 1879.8400000000001
maybe they shot this before the taliban

1881.12 --> 1884.6399999999999
like

1882.88 --> 1888.5590000000002
none of these people running with the

1884.64 --> 1888.5590000000002
planes even have guns or anything

1891.039 --> 1893.84
huh

1904.159 --> 1909.1200000000001
thanksgiving day parade in afghanistan

1906.96 --> 1911.919
who knows who knows

1909.12 --> 1915.32
there's just more to it

1911.919 --> 1915.3200000000002
than you think

1920.72 --> 1924.24
you hope i've been getting some practice

1922.88 --> 1926.5590000000002
in what

1924.24 --> 1928.32
no not really

1926.559 --> 1931.32
where would i do that i'm in the

1928.32 --> 1931.32
netherlands

1938.399 --> 1943.6
the only gun training you get here is in

1940.799 --> 1943.6
video games

1945.279 --> 1948.96
and i don't play those types of video

1947.12 --> 1952.399
games at all

1948.96 --> 1952.3990000000001
i haven't done that since

1953.6 --> 1957.32
since the new century

1962.24 --> 1966.48
well wait it's not entire no 2003 like

1965.12 --> 1970.7199999999998
counter-strike the original

1966.48 --> 1970.72
counter-strike game is like the the last

1971.84 --> 1974.48
like

1972.72 --> 1976.96
military

1974.48 --> 1979.76
simulator

1976.96 --> 1979.76
that i've played

1982.32 --> 1987.9189999999999
and that was in 2003 so

1985.12 --> 1990.9189999999999
yeah after that i kind of lost interest

1987.919 --> 1990.919
entirely

2005.6 --> 2009.76
counter blocks

2007.44 --> 2009.76
what

2010.72 --> 2014.3990000000001
golden eye oh yeah yeah

2014.96 --> 2019.919
yeah that's a very famous game still is

2017.44 --> 2023.24
very popular apparently

2019.919 --> 2023.24
even now

2035.279 --> 2043.08
counter strike on roblox i don't know

2038.48 --> 2043.08
what you're talking about jameson brown

2059.04 --> 2063.599
hey getting wisdom

2060.879 --> 2063.5989999999997
it's been a while

2065.359 --> 2071.639
it's clearly in here too oh yeah yeah

2067.2 --> 2071.6389999999997
hello clary good to see you

2078.879 --> 2083.0789999999997
all right thanks jason brown

2113.76 --> 2117.92
that rocket blames that's not something

2116.079 --> 2120.6400000000003
to laugh about

2117.92 --> 2126.0
whether it is true or not it's not

2120.64 --> 2128.0
something to laugh about it's very

2126.0 --> 2131.32
very out of place

2128.0 --> 2131.32
to do that

2136.72 --> 2140.64
yeah that doesn't matter that you don't

2138.24 --> 2144.4799999999996
think they did some people do and it's

2140.64 --> 2146.24
extremely hurtful to just laugh about it

2144.48 --> 2149.2
don't do that

2146.24 --> 2152.0789999999997
doesn't matter how fake you think you

2149.2 --> 2152.0789999999997
know it is

2154.56 --> 2159.44
right is that's just like oh look at

2157.2 --> 2161.52
these fake beheading videos because

2159.44 --> 2164.0
there was like weird [ __ ] like these

2161.52 --> 2166.88
fake weird execution videos

2164.0 --> 2169.359
with orange suits and [ __ ]

2166.88 --> 2172.2400000000002
but yeah people are shocked over that to

2169.359 --> 2175.52
then just say oh ho ho that's so funny

2172.24 --> 2177.04
because it's fake that's bad don't do

2175.52 --> 2181.96
that

2177.04 --> 2181.96
it's not funny whether it's fake or not

2186.48 --> 2190.56
i was laughing that he took it as gospel

2189.52 --> 2192.16
well

2190.56 --> 2194.24
yeah well you should have kept it to

2192.16 --> 2197.24
yourself it's very inappropriate to do

2194.24 --> 2197.24
that

2207.92 --> 2212.96
just think about that right this

2210.4 --> 2215.28
this is not just this guy you're talking

2212.96 --> 2218.16
to in chat there's everybody else

2215.28 --> 2218.1600000000003
also right

2219.68 --> 2226.0789999999997
and you don't know for sure

2222.32 --> 2229.2000000000003
you don't know there is a suspicion that

2226.079 --> 2233.0
some things or maybe a lot of it is fake

2229.2 --> 2233.0
you don't know though

2244.56 --> 2248.48
no i didn't say that sean hawkins you

2246.96 --> 2250.7200000000003
unbelievable

2248.48 --> 2252.56
dense [ __ ]

2250.72 --> 2256.9599999999996
i specifically

2252.56 --> 2259.92
noted yesterday how i wasn't when i say

2256.96 --> 2262.48
stoic stoic i was addressing two people

2259.92 --> 2264.88
in chat that said they were stoic and

2262.48 --> 2268.72
then i explained what it is because i've

2264.88 --> 2273.04
known stoic people i am not one of them

2268.72 --> 2274.9599999999996
you're really dumb sean hawkins really

2273.04 --> 2278.48
really dumb

2274.96 --> 2280.7200000000003
like a literal [ __ ] would catch on

2278.48 --> 2284.48
to this quicker than you have

2280.72 --> 2286.56
you're such a triggered [ __ ]

2284.48 --> 2289.04
just two seconds of something and you

2286.56 --> 2290.7999999999997
immediately in your head create all this

2289.04 --> 2292.24
idiotic

2290.8 --> 2295.2000000000003
conclusions

2292.24 --> 2297.839
that if you just paid attention beyond

2295.2 --> 2300.16
those two seconds you'd immediately know

2297.839 --> 2302.96
that's not the case you're being

2300.16 --> 2307.359
absolutely stupid

2302.96 --> 2310.32
really really dumb shawn hawkins

2307.359 --> 2312.24
like i'm embarrassed even for you this

2310.32 --> 2314.48
is embarrassing

2312.24 --> 2318.24
and everything about you is embarrassing

2314.48 --> 2318.2400000000002
you just made it even worse

2324.72 --> 2332.0789999999997
yeah you are dumb you are really

2327.839 --> 2334.88
really dumb and everybody knows it

2332.079 --> 2337.3590000000004
you're so dumb that even in the the

2334.88 --> 2338.96
anti-flat earther world everybody thinks

2337.359 --> 2341.49
you're dumb okay

2338.96 --> 2344.54
and that's saying something

2341.49 --> 2344.54
[Music]

2347.359 --> 2352.96
depending angles

2350.0 --> 2354.96
this is what about it what's it gonna do

2352.96 --> 2356.96
what oh you want a presuppose it's a

2354.96 --> 2359.119
sphere of lights again and the earth is

2356.96 --> 2360.96
a ball in between it and really works

2359.119 --> 2363.92
out yeah yeah that's because you just

2360.96 --> 2365.68
can't even figure out that the entire

2363.92 --> 2367.839
angle of approach

2365.68 --> 2370.16
pun intended to the argument is

2367.839 --> 2372.4
completely useless

2370.16 --> 2374.3199999999997
you're just assuming everything and you

2372.4 --> 2376.48
don't even understand that you're doing

2374.32 --> 2378.56
that in the argument

2376.48 --> 2379.599
you're dumb

2378.56 --> 2382.64
really

2379.599 --> 2385.839
really dumb

2382.64 --> 2388.96
it is a bree it's such a breeze actually

2385.839 --> 2390.0
that it's not worth it right because i

2388.96 --> 2391.839
just

2390.0 --> 2395.76
i just did

2391.839 --> 2398.56
the conclusion compacted all in one

2395.76 --> 2402.0
in a single sentence why would i go into

2398.56 --> 2405.2
a debate with you about it when i

2402.0 --> 2409.72
already dispelled the whole thing you're

2405.2 --> 2409.72
an idiot and a waste of time

2423.359 --> 2426.72
can debate a lettuce

2428.24 --> 2431.4399999999996
well you probably could

2430.0 --> 2433.04
at least the lattice is going to be

2431.44 --> 2436.52
honest right they're just not going to

2433.04 --> 2436.52
be very communicative

2445.44 --> 2452.96
you would love well it's too bad because

2447.76 --> 2456.4
i'm not wasting my time with your trash

2452.96 --> 2457.76
i'm not gonna indulge you

2456.4 --> 2461.76
idiots

2457.76 --> 2464.6400000000003
anti-flat earther ignoring idiots

2461.76 --> 2467.599
and dig through trash

2464.64 --> 2471.04
just to try and please you

2467.599 --> 2473.76
i don't care i don't care to please you

2471.04 --> 2476.319
i don't care to dispel your stupid

2473.76 --> 2478.96
little rumors

2476.319 --> 2481.52
i don't care to dispel your stupid

2478.96 --> 2483.92
little gaslighting attempts you can

2481.52 --> 2485.839
literally just choke

2483.92 --> 2487.839
in your own hell

2485.839 --> 2489.92
and squirt

2487.839 --> 2493.119
i don't care

2489.92 --> 2495.599
i don't care about you

2493.119 --> 2498.599
and your ideas and what you think you

2495.599 --> 2498.599
know

2510.64 --> 2514.4
get the [ __ ] out of here [ __ ]

2515.76 --> 2518.88
see you another time

2519.76 --> 2524.079
can you ask me a question about the

2521.76 --> 2525.599
sextant yeah sure you could

2524.079 --> 2528.599
what what do you want to know dusty

2525.599 --> 2528.599
ryder

2564.16 --> 2568.3999999999996
oh bad karma nobody's disputing that the

2566.64 --> 2570.319
buildings came down

2568.4 --> 2573.28
it's just that

2570.319 --> 2575.119
those planes supposedly hitting them

2573.28 --> 2577.92
didn't cause it

2575.119 --> 2580.8
either way couldn't cause it literally

2577.92 --> 2582.88
is if it was and is still a physical

2580.8 --> 2585.119
impossibility

2582.88 --> 2585.119
right

2585.599 --> 2592.92
cgi didn't bring them down

2588.56 --> 2592.92
but planes did neither

2602.16 --> 2607.839
thinks the sexton is evidence of no spin

2605.599 --> 2611.8
no

2607.839 --> 2611.7999999999997
there's nothing to do that

2651.359 --> 2655.44
yeah

2652.16 --> 2656.96
thanks captain obvious

2655.44 --> 2661.88
couldn't have figured that one out if

2656.96 --> 2661.88
you haven't told us bad karma sheesh

2666.319 --> 2669.319
so

2686.4 --> 2691.76
oh you want to know another fact detail

2690.16 --> 2694.0789999999997
huh

2691.76 --> 2697.2000000000003
yeah those supposed

2694.079 --> 2700.079
muslim hijackers remember that when the

2697.2 --> 2702.0
passport was found and all that [ __ ]

2700.079 --> 2702.8390000000004
yeah you know what they did

2702.0 --> 2704.4
they

2702.839 --> 2706.0789999999997
actually

2704.4 --> 2708.2400000000002
used drugs

2706.079 --> 2711.8390000000004
and went to like

2708.24 --> 2715.2
prostitution parties and [ __ ]

2711.839 --> 2715.2
they weren't muslims

2715.599 --> 2723.56
absolutely not

2719.04 --> 2723.56
nobody talks about that though

2757.359 --> 2761.7999999999997
inflate the tire what

2767.119 --> 2771.2000000000003
dude george sanford

2769.28 --> 2774.0
you know have you ever considered that

2771.2 --> 2776.56
it's really bizarre that they only found

2774.0 --> 2777.76
that passport and as you say an inflated

2776.56 --> 2778.72
tire

2777.76 --> 2781.92
when

2778.72 --> 2785.2799999999997
do you know like how much material and

2781.92 --> 2787.52
parts are like in a in a jumbo jet like

2785.28 --> 2789.28
that

2787.52 --> 2790.96
when that thing hit

2789.28 --> 2793.76
like

2790.96 --> 2795.92
so much parts should have been falling

2793.76 --> 2800.0
down like engine

2795.92 --> 2801.76
drop down parts of the wing

2800.0 --> 2806.0
the tail

2801.76 --> 2809.2000000000003
yet it all just disappeared into the

2806.0 --> 2812.16
into the building as it explodes

2809.2 --> 2815.2
now that's odd

2812.16 --> 2817.92
why didn't when it crashed diagonally in

2815.2 --> 2820.3999999999996
the building why didn't the wing break

2817.92 --> 2821.92
off and fall down in its entirety engine

2820.4 --> 2823.76
and all

2821.92 --> 2825.92
like that doesn't make any mechanical

2823.76 --> 2827.3590000000004
sense right that's something that i

2825.92 --> 2829.6800000000003
concluded afterward like there's

2827.359 --> 2831.44
something really odd about how that

2829.68 --> 2833.68
thing

2831.44 --> 2837.119
crashed in there

2833.68 --> 2841.44
and then after oh plain cgi plumes were

2837.119 --> 2841.44
fake i started to realize like wait

2842.079 --> 2845.48
that is weird

2847.599 --> 2852.6400000000003
like that shouldn't be happening there

2849.2 --> 2852.64
should be an airplane wing

2852.72 --> 2858.7999999999997
like having fallen to the ground or like

2855.52 --> 2861.839
hang off the building like that very

2858.8 --> 2864.319
visible yet once upon a crash like every

2861.839 --> 2865.839
part of it is completely gone

2864.319 --> 2867.68
every part of it there's no wings

2865.839 --> 2870.839
sticking out there's no engine hanging

2867.68 --> 2874.7999999999997
around there's no tail nothing it's all

2870.839 --> 2875.839
completely disintegrated

2874.8 --> 2879.559
right

2875.839 --> 2879.5589999999997
that's weird

2892.88 --> 2896.559
hologram techno no no hologram

2894.88 --> 2898.2400000000002
technology

2896.559 --> 2900.8
no

2898.24 --> 2903.52
it was cgi'd

2900.8 --> 2906.559
over it afterward very quickly as in

2903.52 --> 2908.4
they planned the angular shot

2906.559 --> 2910.0
they were planning already from where

2908.4 --> 2912.8
it's going to be filmed that's why all

2910.0 --> 2914.72
those footages were perfectly static so

2912.8 --> 2918.1600000000003
they placed it ahead of time

2914.72 --> 2921.5989999999997
then they prefabricated a cgi plane

2918.16 --> 2923.359
scenario over it

2921.599 --> 2925.2000000000003
then they i don't know blew it up

2923.359 --> 2928.24
somehow in there

2925.2 --> 2931.52
the explosion was probably real and then

2928.24 --> 2933.7599999999998
they just quickly before it hit the news

2931.52 --> 2936.16
roll over the cgi over the actual

2933.76 --> 2938.2400000000002
footage and then quickly

2936.16 --> 2940.24
photoshopped it together and and rolled

2938.24 --> 2943.839
it out live

2940.24 --> 2943.839
that's what i think happened

2944.96 --> 2951.119
like where is the moving stupid mobile

2948.64 --> 2954.8799999999997
camera footage of like oh the plane is

2951.119 --> 2957.92
flying oh no boom and oh it's like

2954.88 --> 2960.88
moving with that [ __ ] is very difficult

2957.92 --> 2963.04
to mask if there's cgi in there that's

2960.88 --> 2966.0
why all those shots of the planes were

2963.04 --> 2969.7599999999998
perfectly static they were all

2966.0 --> 2971.04
seated somewhere preset

2969.76 --> 2973.5200000000004
handheld

2971.04 --> 2975.7599999999998
not even like big news cameras or

2973.52 --> 2978.079
anything were filming it as it was doing

2975.76 --> 2978.079
that

2978.24 --> 2981.24
um

2984.96 --> 2988.64
yeah i know i know

2987.359 --> 2991.7599999999998
joshua

2988.64 --> 2994.72
jahwa is king

2991.76 --> 2997.44
yeah the british reporter

2994.72 --> 2999.2
like oh building seven just fell down as

2997.44 --> 3000.2400000000002
it's just standing there smoking in the

2999.2 --> 3002.319
background

3000.24 --> 3003.359
yeah i remember that i saw that i saw

3002.319 --> 3007.359
that

3003.359 --> 3007.359
like on the news that clip

3008.16 --> 3012.72
was weird

3010.4 --> 3014.559
i didn't see it back then didn't see

3012.72 --> 3016.64
like wait that that doesn't make any

3014.559 --> 3018.6400000000003
sense i just didn't see it i was still

3016.64 --> 3021.839
too shocked about that everything is

3018.64 --> 3024.0
changing oh [ __ ] i didn't see that

3021.839 --> 3026.0789999999997
that that was off although i did figure

3024.0 --> 3031.16
that out very quickly after through all

3026.079 --> 3031.1600000000003
the 911 conspiracy movies

3045.119 --> 3051.04
hey bad karma

3047.28 --> 3053.6800000000003
why don't you stop whining about that

3051.04 --> 3055.68
nobody claims the towers didn't come

3053.68 --> 3057.9199999999996
down yeah

3055.68 --> 3060.8799999999997
put that

3057.92 --> 3062.88
in somebody's face again and i'm banning

3060.88 --> 3066.559
you okay

3062.88 --> 3069.119
[ __ ] off with your disgusting straw man

3066.559 --> 3070.96
claims of what we say that nobody here

3069.119 --> 3075.0
claims yeah you're the only one that's

3070.96 --> 3075.0
saying that you got it buddy

3093.76 --> 3099.28
yeah the supposed footage by civilians

3096.72 --> 3102.3999999999996
well none of the civilians had footage

3099.28 --> 3106.4
of the planes they had footage of the

3102.4 --> 3110.559
buildings on fire and [ __ ] nobody had

3106.4 --> 3112.8
hand-held footage of the actual planes

3110.559 --> 3112.8
huh

3113.44 --> 3117.52
and like unless you

3115.44 --> 3119.19
have proof to the contrary i don't

3117.52 --> 3122.3
remember

3119.19 --> 3122.3
[Music]

3124.72 --> 3129.359
burning building up there like somebody

3126.72 --> 3131.839
filming oh [ __ ] what's this right

3129.359 --> 3133.7599999999998
nobody's like filmed like oh oh what

3131.839 --> 3138.68
there's a plane there oh it's

3133.76 --> 3138.6800000000003
no that's all from static footage

3139.2 --> 3143.52
and i think there were even people that

3140.88 --> 3144.96
were like what a plane hit it what are

3143.52 --> 3147.2
you talking about

3144.96 --> 3149.44
there was a lot of weirdness going on on

3147.2 --> 3152.5589999999997
the streets when that happened and a lot

3149.44 --> 3154.4
of people were filming

3152.559 --> 3158.44
and interviewing others

3154.4 --> 3158.44
and just talking about it

3169.28 --> 3173.76
they got videos of the second one where

3177.44 --> 3183.92
i'd like to see

3178.839 --> 3188.319
that and then i'd like to know like how

3183.92 --> 3189.839
like did they film it and then upload it

3188.319 --> 3193.8
or were

3189.839 --> 3193.7999999999997
their cameras confiscated

3194.16 --> 3197.92
edited slightly

3196.4 --> 3199.839
and then given back

3197.92 --> 3200.7200000000003
or just

3199.839 --> 3203.2
like

3200.72 --> 3206.4399999999996
weirdness happened on the streets too

3203.2 --> 3206.4399999999996
that day

3210.64 --> 3214.24
you have seen shaky vids

3215.2 --> 3221.7599999999998
yeah but look you can take static static

3218.16 --> 3223.839
footage even and then just make it shaky

3221.76 --> 3226.8
afterward that's not the same as

3223.839 --> 3229.2
somebody actually hand holding a camera

3226.8 --> 3231.6800000000003
aiming it like right to the side on the

3229.2 --> 3233.68
straight and then up there and then

3231.68 --> 3235.2
following the plane

3233.68 --> 3238.3999999999996
right

3235.2 --> 3238.3999999999996
that's very different

3245.68 --> 3251.72
yeah no live streaming back then that's

3247.359 --> 3251.72
right that wasn't there yet

3253.04 --> 3257.2799999999997
i mean there was youtube but it was only

3255.2 --> 3259.2799999999997
or it was google video at the time but

3257.28 --> 3261.119
it was just upload

3259.28 --> 3264.92
everything was upload there was no live

3261.119 --> 3264.92
streaming like that yet

3271.44 --> 3275.2400000000002
hello mandy young

3280.319 --> 3283.599
from another tower blockbuster

3284.16 --> 3286.48
right

3287.68 --> 3292.319
well that's the thing you know

3289.92 --> 3294.64
if somebody would have filmed it and

3292.319 --> 3298.48
then like oh quickly upload this on

3294.64 --> 3300.72
youtube then of course like the agencies

3298.48 --> 3303.52
would immediately get in there but if

3300.72 --> 3304.839
somebody filmed it and was just like

3303.52 --> 3306.88
well [ __ ]

3304.839 --> 3310.72
this and just

3306.88 --> 3313.6800000000003
didn't upload it and then maybe 10 years

3310.72 --> 3316.319
20 years later it's like hey

3313.68 --> 3318.3999999999996
oh i got this old mobile here let's see

3316.319 --> 3320.4
what's on there and they find that they

3318.4 --> 3322.64
actually filmed and forgot about it yeah

3320.4 --> 3324.88
that's not going to be edited either

3322.64 --> 3324.8799999999997
right

3325.68 --> 3329.799
that can actually happen

3335.119 --> 3341.04
camcorders yeah

3337.839 --> 3341.04
i remember those things

3344.4 --> 3349.319
my parents had one too like in the 90s

3349.68 --> 3353.04
noisy bastards

3354.78 --> 3359.5190000000002
[Music]

3359.599 --> 3363.839
took forever to turn those on

3404.96 --> 3408.7200000000003
yeah

3406.079 --> 3410.319
yeah that's right

3408.72 --> 3412.48
architects

3410.319 --> 3414.88
engineers and architects of 911 yeah

3412.48 --> 3418.44
yeah it was a huge group i think they're

3414.88 --> 3418.44
still out there

3432.0 --> 3436.799
well bad karma it doesn't really matter

3434.48 --> 3438.799
we're just entertaining

3436.799 --> 3440.319
the suspicion that no planes might have

3438.799 --> 3442.88
hit it

3440.319 --> 3445.44
but yeah there was an explosion the

3442.88 --> 3447.839
entire thing was rigged

3445.44 --> 3449.68
the entire building was rigged there's a

3447.839 --> 3452.4
suspicion there was nano thermite

3449.68 --> 3453.68
involved since there was residue found

3452.4 --> 3455.2000000000003
afterward

3453.68 --> 3457.1189999999997
a lot of dust

3455.2 --> 3460.0789999999997
that pointed at the presence of

3457.119 --> 3463.119
nanothermite

3460.079 --> 3465.44
so yeah and dude there's been so much

3463.119 --> 3467.52
attention to this situation and like

3465.44 --> 3468.64
months before

3467.52 --> 3471.839
like

3468.64 --> 3471.839
suspicious people

3472.16 --> 3477.7599999999998
like part of an agency i think

3475.2 --> 3478.5589999999997
they did like get in there and do stuff

3477.76 --> 3481.599
so

3478.559 --> 3484.559
a lot of people suspect

3481.599 --> 3484.559
that they basically

3484.88 --> 3490.1600000000003
placed

3486.96 --> 3492.48
specific explosives and some people even

3490.16 --> 3495.2799999999997
think that the buildings were literally

3492.48 --> 3497.44
designed with nano thermite inside of

3495.28 --> 3500.8390000000004
its structure as if it was always

3497.44 --> 3505.2000000000003
designed to be blown up one day like

3500.839 --> 3508.24
this right we can't really confirm that

3505.2 --> 3511.2
but yeah the thing was absolutely rigged

3508.24 --> 3514.839
one way or the other and it did explode

3511.2 --> 3519.359
and go down and fall in free fall in on

3514.839 --> 3521.68
itself which no freaking fire can do

3519.359 --> 3524.0789999999997
that's impossible it's the only time

3521.68 --> 3527.96
that's ever happened in history if you

3524.079 --> 3527.96
believe that actually happened

3530.88 --> 3537.04
there's been giant steel structure

3534.319 --> 3539.68
high-rise buildings

3537.04 --> 3543.599
that have been on fire and burned for

3539.68 --> 3545.68
days and days like literally the whole

3543.599 --> 3548.559
thing burned

3545.68 --> 3550.319
and it would still stand

3548.559 --> 3554.1600000000003
because

3550.319 --> 3556.5589999999997
buildings don't fall in on themselves

3554.16 --> 3560.839
from fire like that not these steel

3556.559 --> 3560.8390000000004
structure buildings that's impossible

3582.24 --> 3586.2
okay return to normal

3594.72 --> 3599.9199999999996
jet fuel would have burned up well

3597.2 --> 3602.16
doesn't really matter because if any

3599.92 --> 3604.799
giant jumbo jet would have crashed in

3602.16 --> 3608.0789999999997
there there would be big

3604.799 --> 3610.48
freaking chunks of it having fallen down

3608.079 --> 3611.599
on the ground before the buildings

3610.48 --> 3614.319
collapsed

3611.599 --> 3617.119
you would have seen a wing and like a

3614.319 --> 3619.2799999999997
giant engine laying on the ground in

3617.119 --> 3623.079
front of those buildings

3619.28 --> 3623.079
and there wasn't any

3630.96 --> 3635.2
and like even afterward

3633.44 --> 3637.76
even afterward

3635.2 --> 3640.64
they should have found

3637.76 --> 3642.4
like parts of it right maybe crushed

3640.64 --> 3644.96
because of the collapse

3642.4 --> 3646.7200000000003
but they would have found an engine part

3644.96 --> 3648.64
it would have been there underneath the

3646.72 --> 3650.0789999999997
rubble

3648.64 --> 3652.72
you know

3650.079 --> 3654.1600000000003
you don't disintegrate a jumbo jet

3652.72 --> 3657.1189999999997
engine

3654.16 --> 3658.5589999999997
they're very solid

3657.119 --> 3662.079
very sturdy

3658.559 --> 3663.44
designed to endure incredible forces

3662.079 --> 3666.4
they don't

3663.44 --> 3669.599
just flatten and disintegrate

3666.4 --> 3672.319
like that from fire or from

3669.599 --> 3675.319
being pancaked in between a collapsing

3672.319 --> 3675.319
building

3687.44 --> 3692.079
right if some

3688.96 --> 3695.68
mega jumbo jet crashes somewhere any

3692.079 --> 3697.8390000000004
sort by the way any big plane

3695.68 --> 3698.799
anything could happen it could explode

3697.839 --> 3700.88
it

3698.799 --> 3702.16
if there's like explosives on board or

3700.88 --> 3704.559
whatever

3702.16 --> 3707.839
or it can burn up or it can just

3704.559 --> 3709.8390000000004
completely smack at super high speed and

3707.839 --> 3712.52
this structural damage sort of

3709.839 --> 3716.64
disintegrates it guess what you'll

3712.52 --> 3718.319
always find those freaking engines

3716.64 --> 3720.48
you always do

3718.319 --> 3722.64
because they're really big and really

3720.48 --> 3724.799
solid

3722.64 --> 3726.72
and like even if those types of engines

3724.799 --> 3727.599
catch fire

3726.72 --> 3730.24
right

3727.599 --> 3732.6400000000003
they're still going to be structurally

3730.24 --> 3734.799
the shape they are and have the weight

3732.64 --> 3739.2
they do

3734.799 --> 3741.68
they don't fall apart not on impact not

3739.2 --> 3744.16
yeah well maybe if you had like a really

3741.68 --> 3745.5989999999997
high explosive or something

3744.16 --> 3748.319
right

3745.599 --> 3751.28
that would probably rip it apart or

3748.319 --> 3752.799
launch it into the distance like a giant

3751.28 --> 3755.119
cannonball

3752.799 --> 3758.16
but you always find those engines back

3755.119 --> 3759.599
always always

3758.16 --> 3762.64
no engines

3759.599 --> 3762.6400000000003
no plane crash

3763.359 --> 3767.48
when it comes to jumbo jets

3778.0 --> 3784.24
and black boxes yeah yeah

3780.079 --> 3784.2400000000002
yeah those yeah those are even tougher

3785.2 --> 3790.0789999999997
but they're a lot smaller too so

3788.16 --> 3793.8799999999997
but you always find the engines back

3790.079 --> 3793.88
always always

3797.44 --> 3802.48
no engines

3798.799 --> 3804.799
no plane crash it's that simple

3802.48 --> 3807.92
i've never seen like a sight of an

3804.799 --> 3810.079
actual plane crash and they do crash

3807.92 --> 3812.4
where you couldn't just unlike the first

3810.079 --> 3814.1600000000003
helicopter shot immediately spot the

3812.4 --> 3816.2400000000002
engines you could just see it they're

3814.16 --> 3818.64
very big anyway like anything else can

3816.24 --> 3821.359
be just like crumbled and [ __ ] but the

3818.64 --> 3823.359
engines they're not really at the big

3821.359 --> 3825.44
part body of the plane they're like kind

3823.359 --> 3826.72
of you always see them

3825.44 --> 3830.16
they might have been

3826.72 --> 3832.0
detached rolling further down

3830.16 --> 3834.0
or just laying there

3832.0 --> 3837.48
but you always immediately see oh

3834.0 --> 3837.48
there's the engines

3838.72 --> 3845.8799999999997
no engines

3840.319 --> 3845.88
no giant plane crash it's really basic

3854.65 --> 3857.969
[Music]

3865.76 --> 3870.559
disintegrate the entire planes

3868.559 --> 3871.92
including the engines but yeah the

3870.559 --> 3874.1600000000003
passport did

3871.92 --> 3878.599
slip through there somehow

3874.16 --> 3878.5989999999997
yeah it is kind of weird isn't it

3881.119 --> 3883.44
god

3883.52 --> 3889.28
i can't handle these people

3887.039 --> 3891.5200000000004
it's just as soon as you try to

3889.28 --> 3895.76
critically analyze anything they just

3891.52 --> 3898.079
say no no no no it can't be or you must

3895.76 --> 3899.92
be wrong because you're a flat earther

3898.079 --> 3901.76
and so everything has to be wrong

3899.92 --> 3903.44
according to flat earther let's not

3901.76 --> 3905.28
actually listen to what they have to say

3903.44 --> 3907.92
the arguments they have to bring about

3905.28 --> 3911.52
it let's not draw anything in doubt

3907.92 --> 3912.88
let's just baseline assume

3911.52 --> 3915.599
you're wrong

3912.88 --> 3919.88
because you question something

3915.599 --> 3919.88
it's getting sick of this

3925.039 --> 3928.7990000000004
yeah yeah and you're banned

3934.64 --> 3940.48
yeah bad karma yeah but water

3937.92 --> 3943.28
there's no water cutters there

3940.48 --> 3943.28
you understand

3944.48 --> 3951.079
no water cutters there there were no

3946.799 --> 3951.079
water cutters yeah it's possible

3951.28 --> 3956.799
yeah if you design some things do to do

3954.4 --> 3958.319
something very extreme yeah you can do a

3956.799 --> 3961.68
lot of things

3958.319 --> 3966.24
it's not involved though so your

3961.68 --> 3966.24
argument is a complete straw man

3969.28 --> 3973.3190000000004
that's right return to normal

3984.96 --> 3987.2
what

3988.319 --> 3991.96
natural velocity

4000.24 --> 4003.24
ah

4009.76 --> 4013.44
that's what you're going to say after

4011.28 --> 4016.559
everything i just explained

4013.44 --> 4016.559
about the engines

4016.88 --> 4022.4
oh it's just the impact except it

4019.28 --> 4025.52
doesn't matter how much the impact is it

4022.4 --> 4029.039
doesn't matter how much it is

4025.52 --> 4031.119
the engines are not going to

4029.039 --> 4034.88
disintegrate the only thing that

4031.119 --> 4035.92
disintegrates a jumbo jet engine

4034.88 --> 4037.44
is

4035.92 --> 4040.559
thermite

4037.44 --> 4043.92
very specifically placed on the engines

4040.559 --> 4047.2000000000003
to disintegrate them or super high

4043.92 --> 4048.88
explosives very near to them

4047.2 --> 4050.72
and then you still have to be lucky that

4048.88 --> 4053.599
they're not just launched away like a

4050.72 --> 4053.5989999999997
giant cannonball

4053.839 --> 4056.16
yeah

4056.799 --> 4059.799
it's

4075.039 --> 4078.96
yeah that's right nathan alright that

4076.4 --> 4078.96
happened too

4089.68 --> 4094.24
well rob h not only were the towers

4092.559 --> 4096.2390000000005
designed to withstand the collision

4094.24 --> 4098.48
within a jetliner

4096.239 --> 4102.879999999999
they were insured

4098.48 --> 4106.3189999999995
in short for billions of dollars

4102.88 --> 4109.92
actively in short for billions of

4106.319 --> 4112.400000000001
dollars against it specifically how

4109.92 --> 4114.719
about that one huh

4112.4 --> 4115.92
did you heard that detail

4114.719 --> 4116.839
in short

4115.92 --> 4120.96
for

4116.839 --> 4123.839
billions specifically in the case

4120.96 --> 4126.08
jetliners would hit

4123.839 --> 4129.6
you can't make this [ __ ] up

4126.08 --> 4133.3189999999995
it's true though officially recorded

4129.6 --> 4133.319
officially registered

everybody else in the world was like

4346.8 --> 4350.8
this is [ __ ]

4348.48 --> 4352.48
like not even denying

4350.8 --> 4355.04
that anything happened

4352.48 --> 4357.5199999999995
but just like why the [ __ ] are you going

4355.04 --> 4361.12
to war with iraq that makes no sense and

4357.52 --> 4365.120000000001
that was immediately people knew that

4361.12 --> 4368.5599999999995
immediately they knew this is [ __ ]

4365.12 --> 4371.28
everybody in the world knew knew that

4368.56 --> 4374.0
it was mainstream talking point like

4371.28 --> 4375.679
this is [ __ ]

4374.0 --> 4378.159
what the hell does this have to do with

4375.679 --> 4378.159
iraq

4378.8 --> 4382.28
i remember that

4390.32 --> 4394.96
how do we stop these people while just

4392.32 --> 4397.96
not taking their bait

4394.96 --> 4397.96
ever

4404.239 --> 4406.879999999999
hey eric

4407.199 --> 4413.5599999999995

eleven hundred eleven

4423.52 --> 4429.6
right yeah nathan look with these these

4426.719 --> 4432.08
people as you call them

4429.6 --> 4435.120000000001
the only thing they really do

4432.08 --> 4436.32
is they're being evil enablers

4435.12 --> 4437.679
right

4436.32 --> 4439.599999999999
they just

4437.679 --> 4441.92
put themselves in the position where

4439.6 --> 4443.679
they make up [ __ ] stories and

4441.92 --> 4446.8
narratives

4443.679 --> 4448.96
and propaganda to rile people up to do

4446.8 --> 4451.04
the wrong thing

4448.96 --> 4453.44
and feel okay about it at least at the

4451.04 --> 4454.64
time that's what they do that's how they

4453.44 --> 4457.36
do it

4454.64 --> 4459.04
they're enablers they're

4457.36 --> 4462.4
just

4459.04 --> 4464.96
bad action enablers they set it up

4462.4 --> 4468.5599999999995
they make everybody squirt fall for it

4464.96 --> 4470.2390000000005
get all stupid and ox like like a bunch

4468.56 --> 4472.2390000000005
of balls like

4470.239 --> 4475.28
that's what they want and then they can

4472.239 --> 4476.879999999999
then america can just attack somebody

4475.28 --> 4480.4
like a piece of [ __ ]

4476.88 --> 4480.400000000001
right that's what they do

4481.12 --> 4486.8
they're like enablers

4484.56 --> 4489.280000000001
they can't do [ __ ]

4486.8 --> 4492.0
if people are like no

4489.28 --> 4494.84
no you're wrong we're not falling for

4492.0 --> 4497.719
this but guess what

4494.84 --> 4501.360000000001
americans a lot of them are

4497.719 --> 4502.96
really skilled in falling for [ __ ]

4501.36 --> 4506.239
and going with it

4502.96 --> 4507.76
really really skilled at it

4506.239 --> 4510.959999999999
like

4507.76 --> 4514.400000000001
conditioned i guess

4510.96 --> 4514.4
for for generations

4516.8 --> 4522.2390000000005
and i think most of it probably has to

4518.88 --> 4523.1990000000005
do with complete mind destruction media

4522.239 --> 4525.599999999999
right

4523.199 --> 4528.12
media especially advertisement in the

4525.6 --> 4533.04
united states has been

4528.12 --> 4535.36
extremely bad like a really attack mind

4533.04 --> 4536.88
attack i remember it i remember like in

4535.36 --> 4538.88
the 90s

4536.88 --> 4541.84
and even before the 80s

4538.88 --> 4545.12
like i wanted to watch cartoons and [ __ ]

4541.84 --> 4547.12
but we would have like dutch advertising

4545.12 --> 4548.8
right which is much more modest it's

4547.12 --> 4550.239
gone worse

4548.8 --> 4553.28
since then

4550.239 --> 4555.759999999999
but then sometimes you'd get to see like

4553.28 --> 4558.159
american advertisement and it's like

4555.76 --> 4561.360000000001
every time i saw it the first sensation

4558.159 --> 4564.5599999999995
i got as a kid is like oh jesus

4561.36 --> 4566.639999999999
jesus what the [ __ ] man get away from me

4564.56 --> 4568.2390000000005
you freaking devil

4566.64 --> 4570.320000000001
like

4568.239 --> 4572.639999999999
so bad

4570.32 --> 4575.44
so bad the ads

4572.64 --> 4577.6
like no wonder americans

4575.44 --> 4580.5599999999995
like especially like city folk have

4577.6 --> 4584.2390000000005
become like complete zombies their minds

4580.56 --> 4585.6
were literally destroyed literally

4584.239 --> 4587.199
destroyed

4585.6 --> 4591.360000000001
from television

4587.199 --> 4591.36
because it's that bad over there

4592.08 --> 4598.4
it was that bad for a very long time and

4595.04 --> 4600.64
it destroys the mind it literally

4598.4 --> 4604.0
destroys it it destroys the spirit it

4600.64 --> 4606.4800000000005
destroys critical thinking it destroys

4604.0 --> 4608.4
natural moral balance

4606.48 --> 4611.599999999999
and people yeah when you destroy their

4608.4 --> 4615.12
minds they become very susceptible to

4611.6 --> 4617.1990000000005
propaganda and they just want to attack

4615.12 --> 4619.28
they will hate the world because their

4617.199 --> 4621.919999999999
mind is destroyed by it

4619.28 --> 4624.32
and they just want an excuse to start

4621.92 --> 4627.1990000000005
murdering people they just want the

4624.32 --> 4630.799999999999
genocide they're just like

4627.199 --> 4633.12
my mind is destroyed i wanna kill

4630.8 --> 4634.96
give me an excuse to kill

4633.12 --> 4637.12
that's what happens

4634.96 --> 4640.88
when you have several generation of

4637.12 --> 4642.64
super heavy psychological warfare

4640.88 --> 4645.52
if you're in that if you're subjected to

4642.64 --> 4648.679
that for several generations no wonder

4645.52 --> 4648.679
you know

4658.4 --> 4663.04
can just imagine

4660.96 --> 4665.12
that it wouldn't that

4663.04 --> 4666.64
the level of indoctrination would have

4665.12 --> 4669.12
been like two

4666.64 --> 4670.08
european levels as you would have said

4669.12 --> 4671.5199999999995
it

4670.08 --> 4674.32
back then

4671.52 --> 4676.64
i bet that none of all this crap in the

4674.32 --> 4679.28
military industrial complex endless ward

4676.64 --> 4681.679
could have ever happened

4679.28 --> 4684.159
it could have only worked

4681.679 --> 4687.12
if they destroyed everybody's mind

4684.159 --> 4687.12
through television

4687.52 --> 4694.320000000001
and like really destroy it like make you

4690.84 --> 4697.28
unnecessarily extra dumb oh

4694.32 --> 4699.92
we have to keep it dumb for

4697.28 --> 4701.28
more viewers because then more people

4699.92 --> 4705.12
will see it

4701.28 --> 4708.48
yeah that's very cute statistically yeah

4705.12 --> 4711.5199999999995
what it also does is absolutely lower

4708.48 --> 4713.678999999999
the bar for everybody anybody that could

4711.52 --> 4716.64
have been pretty intelligent is now

4713.679 --> 4720.0
gonna hide or gonna have a tendency to

4716.64 --> 4721.4400000000005
hide in the [ __ ] masses that's what

4720.0 --> 4724.32
it actually does

4721.44 --> 4727.36
it destroys everybody's mind when you

4724.32 --> 4729.199
lower the bar to an average [ __ ]

4727.36 --> 4731.28
level

4729.199 --> 4735.839999999999
in like the way that is spoken if like

4731.28 --> 4738.639999999999
people on tv like speak like morons

4735.84 --> 4742.08
it's gonna make everybody morons

4738.64 --> 4745.679
just like if you have freaking gay

4742.08 --> 4748.159
everybody's a [ __ ] everybody's a [ __ ] all

4745.679 --> 4750.719
the women are all out of control and

4748.159 --> 4753.36
arrogant and just demonic and all the

4750.719 --> 4756.88
guys are all just a bunch of weenies

4753.36 --> 4759.199
yeah guess what that's gonna do

4756.88 --> 4762.0
it's gonna make everybody like that

4759.199 --> 4766.719
that's what it does that's how it works

4762.0 --> 4770.96
it sets the example for people to copy

4766.719 --> 4772.56
right people that have no life plan

4770.96 --> 4775.28
they just copy

4772.56 --> 4778.080000000001
whatever they get confronted with

4775.28 --> 4780.08
oh oh that's how it goes okay

4778.08 --> 4781.5199999999995
okay i'm gonna be one of those things

4780.08 --> 4783.92
then

4781.52 --> 4787.76
that's what it does

4783.92 --> 4790.4800000000005
if you make the tv absolutely [ __ ]

4787.76 --> 4792.719
then a lot of those people are gonna be

4790.48 --> 4796.159
absolutely [ __ ]

4792.719 --> 4796.159
now if you're gonna make the tv

4796.719 --> 4801.679
like

4798.08 --> 4804.64
highly morally dubious like

4801.679 --> 4806.4
sadistic and just dark

4804.64 --> 4808.8
and guess what that's gonna do it's

4806.4 --> 4811.5199999999995
gonna make a whole bunch of people

4808.8 --> 4814.639
think like oh okay i guess that's normal

4811.52 --> 4816.88
now so i'll just let myself also become

4814.639 --> 4818.96
sadistic and dark because that's normal

4816.88 --> 4822.400000000001
now right

4818.96 --> 4823.84
are we gonna make the tv all gay and out

4822.4 --> 4827.12
of whack

4823.84 --> 4832.360000000001
anti-family guess what's gonna happen

4827.12 --> 4832.36
yeah now you understand how that works

4836.32 --> 4839.639
what the [ __ ]

4853.44 --> 4857.04
yeah i guess it's troll time

4855.44 --> 4860.04
i'll be alright i'll be back in two

4857.04 --> 4860.04
minutes

4973.679 --> 4977.12
oh

4974.56 --> 4977.120000000001
what happened

4979.679 --> 4982.679
oh

4988.4 --> 4991.4
hmm

5008.88 --> 5012.96
right yeah joshua asking

5010.88 --> 5015.28
well how many times

5012.96 --> 5016.8
does do any of you

5015.28 --> 5018.719
in chat

5016.8 --> 5021.6
remember

5018.719 --> 5024.4
when it comes to like the medical

5021.6 --> 5029.1990000000005
supposed situation happening how many

5024.4 --> 5030.719
times do people that like promote the v

5029.199 --> 5033.759999999999
how many times

5030.719 --> 5035.92
like in throughout the year as any of

5033.76 --> 5040.280000000001
those people actually said okay just

5035.92 --> 5040.28
stay calm people don't panic

5045.04 --> 5048.04
zero

5062.08 --> 5068.159
who that has ever promoted the medical

5065.199 --> 5070.96
situation claimed to be real

5068.159 --> 5074.638999999999
who of those people those propagandists

5070.96 --> 5076.88
has ever told everybody to not panic

5074.639 --> 5079.1990000000005
just take it easy

5076.88 --> 5081.1990000000005
nobody

5079.199 --> 5082.5599999999995
nobody tells you that

5081.199 --> 5084.638999999999
no they're all

5082.56 --> 5088.96
trying to rub it in everything is

5084.639 --> 5092.8
supposed to excite you to be more scared

5088.96 --> 5092.8
none of them tell you not to panic

5096.88 --> 5101.76
i mean maybe a couple of people have

5099.44 --> 5103.839999999999
like way in the beginning when it wasn't

5101.76 --> 5105.84
yet clear as to what was really going

5103.84 --> 5108.2390000000005
down for a lot of people

5105.84 --> 5110.32
but overall the the people that are part

5108.239 --> 5114.799999999999
of the narrative that make money of this

5110.32 --> 5114.799999999999
[ __ ] they don't tell you not to panic

5119.36 --> 5127.0
no they they seem to actually push you

5121.92 --> 5127.0
towards panic almost by design

5156.96 --> 5161.679
what you don't like your chat ethnicity

5160.159 --> 5166.28
what the hell

5161.679 --> 5166.28
does that even mean good servants

5180.96 --> 5183.84
you're not blue

5188.639 --> 5191.4400000000005
now you're green

5195.52 --> 5199.92
it's either blue green or gray

5204.239 --> 5208.959999999999
or like what is it yellow if it's me

5209.679 --> 5211.84
why

5211.92 --> 5216.12
what do you need the wrench for

5244.32 --> 5248.239
i collect them well that's too bad

5248.48 --> 5252.5599999999995
i'm not gonna

5249.92 --> 5254.32
don't really care about that

5252.56 --> 5258.120000000001
right i like wrenches because i can

5254.32 --> 5258.12
actually use them

5270.8 --> 5273.8
so

5288.239 --> 5293.599999999999
yeah if it's an issue every news service

5291.199 --> 5296.32
would say they were the first to say

5293.6 --> 5299.52
downtown yeah that's that's true james

5296.32 --> 5301.92
mason they'll say it afterward

5299.52 --> 5303.040000000001
when they're confronted by it look all

5301.92 --> 5306.0
of this

5303.04 --> 5308.48
[ __ ] rolling out right

5306.0 --> 5310.8
the whole medical industrial complex

5308.48 --> 5313.36
scam

5310.8 --> 5315.28
death based scam

5313.36 --> 5316.96
genetic mutilation

5315.28 --> 5318.32
murder scam

5316.96 --> 5321.199
yeah

5318.32 --> 5324.0
people that are tied into that they are

5321.199 --> 5326.08
like to they are really in a bad place

5324.0 --> 5328.4
and they're not going to come out

5326.08 --> 5330.48
if this thing like becomes

5328.4 --> 5333.12
gets to a tipping point where suddenly

5330.48 --> 5335.199
they lose control

5333.12 --> 5337.44
the legal backing for it

5335.199 --> 5339.919999999999
what a supposedly go back the mechanism

5337.44 --> 5341.919999999999
that keeps this thing going

5339.92 --> 5344.88
in the face of everything once that

5341.92 --> 5346.0
stops they're all gonna suddenly roll

5344.88 --> 5350.400000000001
out like

5346.0 --> 5353.679
lawyer level hours of excuses

5350.4 --> 5356.0
excuses excuses roll back gaslighting

5353.679 --> 5358.159
and [ __ ] straw manning

5356.0 --> 5360.48
saying we would said didn't that and

5358.159 --> 5363.48
then have no evidence for that

5360.48 --> 5363.48
absolutely

5377.44 --> 5381.5199999999995
right

5378.719 --> 5384.4800000000005
yeah statistics man

5381.52 --> 5386.320000000001
they really are abusing the statistical

5384.48 --> 5388.5599999999995
fraud game

5386.32 --> 5390.4
just making up statistics putting them

5388.56 --> 5394.320000000001
out of context although they didn't

5390.4 --> 5397.679
invent that you know it's actually the

5394.32 --> 5399.04
supposed climate alarmists that invented

5397.679 --> 5401.36
that [ __ ]

5399.04 --> 5405.56
they invented statistical fraud and

5401.36 --> 5405.5599999999995
using it on a mass scale

5417.12 --> 5423.5199999999995
but yeah the medical industrial complex

5419.6 --> 5426.0
has made its move in that regard as well

5423.52 --> 5429.4400000000005
statistical fraud it's the default so

5426.0 --> 5429.44
default to get progression

5431.52 --> 5436.56
how many people i can't keep track of

5434.159 --> 5439.04
that yet

5436.56 --> 5439.04
a lot

5440.96 --> 5444.8
but there's another thing too you know

5442.88 --> 5447.1990000000005
they

5444.8 --> 5449.6
the same people that are forwarding this

5447.199 --> 5450.96
scam or in control of the stats so they

5449.6 --> 5455.1990000000005
can

5450.96 --> 5458.639
just every person that has got a v

5455.199 --> 5460.879999999999
they'll just say they died from c

5458.639 --> 5462.719
naturally

5460.88 --> 5465.28
that's what they're gonna say every

5462.719 --> 5467.6
single they will just not admit that

5465.28 --> 5469.759999999999
it's the v that causes it they'll just

5467.6 --> 5470.8
not admit it statistically they'll just

5469.76 --> 5475.4400000000005
like

5470.8 --> 5478.96
completely fraud it the complete fraud

5475.44 --> 5481.44
total jumbling around of the stats

5478.96 --> 5486.159
it's already exposed it's already like

5481.44 --> 5488.879999999999
blatantly proven with examples out there

5486.159 --> 5491.36
like actual doctors

5488.88 --> 5494.159000000001
and nurses like coming forward with the

5491.36 --> 5494.159
raw data

5494.88 --> 5497.88
so

5504.639 --> 5508.4800000000005
but it's going to be a lot more because

5506.4 --> 5511.12
just not all of them die

5508.48 --> 5511.12
right away

5511.52 --> 5514.400000000001
but they're going to get chronic

5512.8 --> 5517.1990000000005
problems that are going to last their

5514.4 --> 5521.759999999999
entire lifetime and

5517.199 --> 5521.759999999999
very likely significantly shorten it

5525.6 --> 5530.52
especially if they take more than one

5550.0 --> 5553.159
all right

5570.159 --> 5575.839999999999
oh and can it's well i can but i have to

5573.04 --> 5575.84
mask it a little

5575.92 --> 5582.32
like in chat you can say whatever you

5578.0 --> 5587.0
like right i can't do anything about it

5582.32 --> 5587.0
but i'm just gonna call it a v

5589.28 --> 5596.0
and i i'm going to call the condition c

5594.0 --> 5600.92
because that's very convenient to do

5596.0 --> 5600.92
that it's not that hard to figure it out

5602.4 --> 5608.719
right and as long as i do that i can

5604.32 --> 5610.0
just elaborate on the actual thing

5608.719 --> 5612.08
without

5610.0 --> 5614.719
basically having

5612.08 --> 5617.84
yeah a potential new strike or that kind

5614.719 --> 5617.84
of crap

5617.92 --> 5623.52
what's my thoughts on water fluoridation

5620.159 --> 5623.5199999999995
well yes terrible

5624.4 --> 5630.799999999999
it's a consciousness killer

5627.76 --> 5633.52
calcifies your pineal gland is terrible

5630.8 --> 5637.360000000001
for your teeth

5633.52 --> 5637.360000000001
and your kidneys

5637.679 --> 5640.56
and

5638.639 --> 5645.0
just the whole range of things in your

5640.56 --> 5645.0
body it's very bad for you

5645.28 --> 5649.599999999999
the teeth part is the most ironic though

5647.84 --> 5651.12
because that's what supposed to be

5649.6 --> 5653.4400000000005
helping for

5651.12 --> 5655.92
right also it's not actually fluoride

5653.44 --> 5657.44
right it's not calcium fluoride which

5655.92 --> 5659.92
is kind of good

5657.44 --> 5661.0
to take that

5659.92 --> 5663.52
no it's

5661.0 --> 5665.679
hydrofluorosilicic acid

5663.52 --> 5667.280000000001
rat poison really

5665.679 --> 5670.56
that's what it really is that's what it

5667.28 --> 5673.12
used to be used for rat poison it's a

5670.56 --> 5675.92
byproduct

5673.12 --> 5678.5599999999995
from chemical industries

5675.92 --> 5680.2390000000005
i think specifically in the mining

5678.56 --> 5681.92
side products

5680.239 --> 5683.119
scrubbing as well

5681.92 --> 5684.88
from

5683.119 --> 5688.08
coal

5684.88 --> 5688.08
and what is it again uh

5688.239 --> 5690.638999999999
chalk

5692.32 --> 5697.679
aluminium right it's it's a typical

5694.88 --> 5699.1990000000005
byproduct from a whole range of things

5697.679 --> 5703.04
and it's very bad

5699.199 --> 5705.119
it's acidic it's extremely toxic in

5703.04 --> 5707.6
concentrated forms it just kills

5705.119 --> 5707.599999999999
everything

5708.56 --> 5713.119000000001
but in small bits it's bio

5711.199 --> 5715.839999999999
cumulative

5713.119 --> 5717.28
and it calcifies your pineal grand

5715.84 --> 5718.0
glands

5717.28 --> 5720.5599999999995
like

5718.0 --> 5722.0
ruins your teeth

5720.56 --> 5723.679
and your bones

5722.0 --> 5724.719
your bones too i almost forgot about

5723.679 --> 5726.639
that

5724.719 --> 5729.44
it could cause all kinds of like lumps

5726.639 --> 5731.92
on the bones themselves terrible pain

5729.44 --> 5734.799999999999
when you get that and kidneys severe

5731.92 --> 5734.8
kidney problems

5737.04 --> 5741.44
and that's just in the diluted form

5739.52 --> 5744.56
right because if you get it concentrated

5741.44 --> 5749.239
you're gonna die very quickly

5744.56 --> 5749.2390000000005
extremely excruciating too

5765.44 --> 5769.119
they collect it

5766.88 --> 5772.08
now they don't really collect it

5769.119 --> 5773.679
it's a toxic waste they have it there is

5772.08 --> 5775.84
like

5773.679 --> 5777.679
bags and bags of that [ __ ] and they

5775.84 --> 5779.76
don't know what to do with it because

5777.679 --> 5782.08
they keep producing more as a side

5779.76 --> 5785.4400000000005
product and it's totally toxic they

5782.08 --> 5787.84
can't do anything with it

5785.44 --> 5790.879999999999
except poison things

5787.84 --> 5794.32
or try to store it in order to prevent

5790.88 --> 5794.32
it from poisoning things

5795.28 --> 5798.88
only option is water filtrate well if

5797.119 --> 5801.599999999999
you have fluoridated water yes

5798.88 --> 5801.6
absolutely

5806.639 --> 5812.8
you want a berkey but so expensive what

5809.36 --> 5815.04
in what do you think

5812.8 --> 5817.4400000000005
what is going to be more expensive

5815.04 --> 5819.04
one-time investment in good water

5817.44 --> 5822.08
filtration

5819.04 --> 5824.96
because it has to be good

5822.08 --> 5827.36
or like even you could also just like

5824.96 --> 5829.28
evaporate water what is it condensing

5827.36 --> 5831.28
and condensing it again and that way

5829.28 --> 5832.8
yeah you'll dump all the minerals out of

5831.28 --> 5835.36
it but at least you'll get the fluoride

5832.8 --> 5835.360000000001
out as well

5835.6 --> 5840.8
but what is more expensive

5838.56 --> 5844.4800000000005
the one-time investment

5840.8 --> 5846.08
what is it 300 us dollars indeed

5844.48 --> 5848.799999999999
and there's other systems too it's all

5846.08 --> 5850.8
become much more cheap these days so

5848.8 --> 5853.679
or

5850.8 --> 5856.719
the medical bill

5853.679 --> 5858.4800000000005
10 years or 20 years later

5856.719 --> 5860.96
when you got like

5858.48 --> 5863.119
damaged organs and suddenly you need

5860.96 --> 5867.4800000000005
like this medicine or you need these

5863.119 --> 5867.48
upper what's going to be more expensive

5870.639 --> 5874.2390000000005
distilled right that yeah that was the

5872.48 --> 5877.239
word i was looking for distilled water

5874.239 --> 5877.239
yes

5884.48 --> 5890.159
right and there's also an issue that

5886.88 --> 5893.28
if you take it you can't just like add

5890.159 --> 5896.0
like okay i drink fluoridated water

5893.28 --> 5898.5599999999995
you can't just take something beside

5896.0 --> 5900.88
that to make it go away

5898.56 --> 5902.96
that doesn't work you have to completely

5900.88 --> 5905.6
stop

5902.96 --> 5908.719
the build up of it

5905.6 --> 5910.2390000000005
and then detoxify and it takes some time

5908.719 --> 5913.36
as long as you're taking it you can't

5910.239 --> 5913.36
get it out of your body

5916.88 --> 5920.56
does the alcohol have negative effects

5918.4 --> 5924.119
on the body yes do i refrain from

5920.56 --> 5924.119000000001
alcohol no

5924.639 --> 5929.92
but i don't take high concentrated

5926.96 --> 5929.92
alcohol drinks

5930.88 --> 5933.92
don't even like those

5935.119 --> 5941.5199999999995
and yeah if you give your body enough

5937.44 --> 5943.44
time to basically clean up afterward and

5941.52 --> 5945.040000000001
not go to sleep

5943.44 --> 5946.239
when you still have alcohol in your

5945.04 --> 5947.84
system

5946.239 --> 5952.599999999999
then you'll find that the amount of

5947.84 --> 5952.6
damage can be kept to a minimum

5954.719 --> 5958.159
like i never have hangovers

5957.04 --> 5961.679
never

5958.159 --> 5961.679
unless i break those rules

5962.4 --> 5967.44
drink too much

5963.84 --> 5968.719
too strong too late yeah then you get

5967.44 --> 5970.879999999999
problems

5968.719 --> 5974.2390000000005
but as long as you make sure that your

5970.88 --> 5976.719
sleep cycle is is free of alcohol then

5974.239 --> 5980.44
your body actually fixes more than most

5976.719 --> 5980.44
people take for granted

5980.639 --> 5983.639
ugh

5996.48 --> 6000.239
okay that's messed up george sanford

5998.32 --> 6002.32
what in the netherlands

6000.239 --> 6004.5599999999995
it's illegal

6002.32 --> 6009.639
it's illegal to put fluoride in the

6004.56 --> 6009.639
water thank god it's illegal

6030.4 --> 6033.4
so

6044.639 --> 6048.36
why are you asking

6051.36 --> 6056.719
are you some like information gathering

6054.4 --> 6059.199
bot or something

6056.719 --> 6062.08
like you just come in here and just

6059.199 --> 6064.239
start asking personal questions and [ __ ]

6062.08 --> 6067.84
like what the f who the [ __ ] are you to

6064.239 --> 6068.959999999999
just start rolling in there and asking

6067.84 --> 6070.96
like you're

6068.96 --> 6073.76
some kind of consensus worker or

6070.96 --> 6077.4800000000005
something who the [ __ ] are you

6073.76 --> 6077.4800000000005
what are you doing here

6096.159 --> 6102.638999999999
have one beer before you go to sleep now

6099.28 --> 6102.639
well it's better than whiskey

6103.119 --> 6107.839999999999
but i wouldn't do it before i go to

6104.719 --> 6110.159
sleep i specifically don't want any more

6107.84 --> 6112.32
sensation of alcohol in my system when i

6110.159 --> 6116.36
go to sleep

6112.32 --> 6116.36
it's disruptive to me

6140.11 --> 6143.228999999999
[Music]

6145.679 --> 6149.36
oh that's sure shut him up or not

6147.87 --> 6153.599999999999
[Music]

6149.36 --> 6155.119
oh you will leave my chat really so

6153.6 --> 6157.119000000001
what are you doing here in the first

6155.119 --> 6159.679
place what are you doing here

6157.119 --> 6162.159
just curious what like a data gathering

6159.679 --> 6164.08
bot are you trying to profile people

6162.159 --> 6167.839999999999
what are you doing here

6164.08 --> 6171.84
who are you what do you stand for

6167.84 --> 6173.76
why are you here in this show in my chat

6171.84 --> 6175.4400000000005
why don't you answer some questions why

6173.76 --> 6176.88
don't you tell something about yourself
