also thanks to a good talk with my

188.1 --> 197.12
friend good servant it's just such a

193.459 --> 197.12
good Samaritan

197.3 --> 202.08
like yeah I had to basically just throw

200.31 --> 209.43
down something without I was struggling

202.08 --> 212.9
with and I yeah so I yeah I tried it out

209.43 --> 212.9
and he was great

215.45 --> 221.14999999999998
and he shared some yeah his family

218.629 --> 226.64
issues and like I don't know the guy so

221.15 --> 230.18
forthcoming and he's great and yeah it

226.64 --> 233.23899999999998
helped a lot and I'm yeah I'm still in

230.18 --> 236.54000000000002
this situation where there is yeah

233.239 --> 244.19
there's there's like a in there shift

236.54 --> 247.489
happen somehow yeah oh you need a shift

244.19 --> 248.989
with Arwen so like oh wow what's new you

247.489 --> 251.019
know that kind of [ __ ] seems to be

248.989 --> 255.41
happening to me like three times a year

251.019 --> 261.35
on average but in this case yeah I

255.41 --> 264.83
typically notice it by things like the

261.35 --> 268.55
the sensory input that things give me

264.83 --> 270.40999999999997
become slightly different so suddenly

268.55 --> 274.82
it's like everything becomes new again

270.41 --> 277.51000000000005
but that takes completely takes away the

274.82 --> 282.2
balance of things that I'm used to and

277.51 --> 285.34999999999997
that's really frustrating in many ways

282.2 --> 287.45
and it literally like makes me make

285.35 --> 289.40000000000003
mistakes all of a sudden and then I got

287.45 --> 295.24
really frustrated about those mistakes

289.4 --> 298.46
and yeah that results in a lot of like

295.24 --> 302.0
stress and anger towards myself blaming

298.46 --> 307.13
myself like why am I so annoyingly

302.0 --> 309.229
complicated and yeah if things go bad

307.13 --> 313.96999999999997
then I dramatis eyes it draw everything

309.229 --> 315.44
of my past and do it again but I don't

313.97 --> 317.47900000000004
know something that has come out of it

315.44 --> 318.65
is that yeah I didn't drink any alcohol

317.479 --> 323.78
and I feel great

318.65 --> 328.58
and I didn't buy any today and now I

323.78 --> 330.53
don't want to yeah I don't know for some

328.58 --> 333.289
people out there that would be like wow

330.53 --> 338.98999999999995
that's really awesome and all that for

333.289 --> 342.59
me it's like no it's not fair because

338.99 --> 344.659
I'm stopping drinking because like it's

342.59 --> 346.34
become dangerous I'm not stopping

344.659 --> 348.56
drinking because I want to stop at

346.34 --> 351.169
drinking see it's not fair

348.56 --> 354.91
I should I technically don't think that

351.169 --> 359.93
I deserve the praise I'm just being

354.91 --> 361.43
responsible enough you see Wow that I

359.93 --> 364.31
really needed to get that off my chest

361.43 --> 373.49
it's just that that's how I judge things

364.31 --> 375.8
I yeah anyway so I'm just stopping again

373.49 --> 378.98
now and let's just see where this goes

375.8 --> 380.90000000000003
so far it's been great I lit the weird

378.98 --> 383.84000000000003
thing was it's this double-edged sword

380.9 --> 388.46
because my sense is literally clear up

383.84 --> 391.60999999999996
pretty quickly and I forget about that

388.46 --> 394.21999999999997
it does kind of dim the senses over a

391.61 --> 396.83000000000004
period not just when you're drinking

394.22 --> 399.26000000000005
it's odd how you forget that but

396.83 --> 401.10999999999996
initially you can start doing that to

399.26 --> 404.479
forget that because when it comes back

401.11 --> 409.52000000000004
it's like this extra responsibility

404.479 --> 412.58
stress feeling and I don't know deep

409.52 --> 414.83
down anxiety effects from a past and all

412.58 --> 416.78
that it's like everything clears up

414.83 --> 423.85999999999996
including the ugly parts that's I guess

416.78 --> 427.58
a good comparison and but now yeah I was

423.86 --> 430.16
already getting so worked up it's almost

427.58 --> 434.59999999999997
like hey yeah that's exactly what I need

430.16 --> 440.02000000000004
right now like because of practical

434.6 --> 443.36
situations I wanna I wanna move it

440.02 --> 445.96999999999997
somehow some way whether it be through

443.36 --> 448.40000000000003
the early bird show and what I do here

445.97 --> 451.61
or through learning new stuff I've been

448.4 --> 454.69
basically just thinking back and crying

451.61 --> 457.34000000000003
literally sounds really silly I guess

454.69 --> 459.2
about all the missed opportunities of

457.34 --> 464.27
when I could have like learned so much

459.2 --> 467.53
and I'm like why why am I not like a

464.27 --> 470.33
studied doctor why couldn't I do that I

467.53 --> 473.51
hate myself for it because that would

470.33 --> 475.88
have been so awesome in yeah in many

473.51 --> 479.32
ways and less awesome in other ways have

475.88 --> 479.32
probably dragged down in some

480.79 --> 491.42
creepy behaviors maybe maybe I don't

487.49 --> 493.34000000000003
know about that you know it's yeah and

491.42 --> 497.12
then it's grass is greener on the other

493.34 --> 500.33
side it it's just like I wish I wish but

497.12 --> 506.0
then I overlooked what I do got and when

500.33 --> 509.81
I can still get out of all this and yeah

506.0 --> 513.68
when I feel very pressed and yeah very

509.81 --> 515.78
dramatic you call it then I just don't

513.68 --> 517.7199999999999
see in that moment like there's just no

515.78 --> 519.89
hope technically in that moment like

517.72 --> 523.5500000000001
yeah you could think of something but

519.89 --> 525.83
there's no energy that allows any

523.55 --> 529.16
durable vision to manifest in such a

525.83 --> 532.1600000000001
moment but then in another moment I'm

529.16 --> 534.62
pretty much restored and then there is

532.16 --> 538.76
definitely that energy it's it's just

534.62 --> 540.86
back just like that it's like a story

538.76 --> 543.89
that's always been there is certainly

540.86 --> 546.73
always been gone and then certainly it

543.89 --> 553.03
returns like it was always there again

546.73 --> 555.97
that's what it feels like to me and it's

553.03 --> 559.37
extremely disconcerting to the

555.97 --> 567.02
consciousness that this keeps on

559.37 --> 570.05
happening to me it is right so let's

567.02 --> 575.35
just say that most people that have this

570.05 --> 575.3499999999999
are completely psychotic

576.579 --> 583.399
because it they can't handle that

580.069 --> 587.8389999999999
reality their senses just switches on

583.399 --> 590.269
them and they get completely lost now

587.839 --> 592.85
I've built like an intellectual sub

590.269 --> 599.629
framework that is perfectly stable no

592.85 --> 603.589
matter what but it is without heart so

599.629 --> 606.35
whatever's flaming up from which side it

603.589 --> 608.4190000000001
has the intellectual thing to reflect

606.35 --> 611.239
upon and then I carefully look through

608.419 --> 614.119
my intellectual law book of the codes of

611.239 --> 624.289
morality to figure out like is this a

614.119 --> 628.0690000000001
sensible impulse because yeah sometimes

624.289 --> 630.049
just some frustration gets compacted in

628.069 --> 637.8789999999999
me and then just some weird [ __ ] comes

630.049 --> 640.6089999999999
out hmm but yeah not as weird as it used

637.879 --> 646.039
to be thank God it used to be a lot

640.609 --> 649.4590000000001
worse like so bad that I would never

646.039 --> 652.039
even accept that it existed that level

649.459 --> 655.0999999999999
of that and I guess that maybe I think

652.039 --> 657.98
that some yeah double downing ballers

655.1 --> 661.609
may be suffering through that effect

657.98 --> 664.389
that mechanism specifically that they've

661.609 --> 667.4290000000001
gone so far that they can't even accept

664.389 --> 671.509
that they've gone that that is a thing

667.429 --> 678.31
anymore to themselves because their

671.509 --> 682.009
senses are just burned off by it yeah

678.31 --> 686.899
well it's just a separate effect not

682.009 --> 689.12
saying that I am like that because I

686.899 --> 690.769
have to the moral program to reflect

689.12 --> 693.829
upon that moral program is not

690.769 --> 696.62
politically flexible it's never been

693.829 --> 699.38
it's always been like my book no matter

696.62 --> 702.829
what happens in the world no matter if I

699.38 --> 706.9399999999999
suddenly land in hell or I suddenly get

702.829 --> 709.459
like in like a death situation in

706.94 --> 711.62
another dimension or at throwing a god

709.459 --> 713.829
like no the book is the book it's my

711.62 --> 717.5
book it is basically the moral

713.829 --> 721.91
construction that I made by my judgment

717.5 --> 726.079
only and I reflected on everything but

721.91 --> 729.56
yeah I don't know I think it saved my

726.079 --> 737.54
skin many times now that construct is

729.56 --> 740.54
part of me so now I'm talking about

737.54 --> 743.209
these very complex inner mechanisms and

740.54 --> 745.04
all that I realized like yeah they are

743.209 --> 747.31
that's that's our Rin right this is my

745.04 --> 749.99
level this is what I typically do and

747.31 --> 752.54
then I realized that in the last week

749.99 --> 756.889
for example I was just regularly

752.54 --> 760.91
drinking sometimes some of these

756.889 --> 762.8
thoughts would spring up and then just

760.91 --> 766.1899999999999
fizzle out after a while I would lose

762.8 --> 769.79
track like that now that I've concluded

766.19 --> 773.72
is a an effect that is enhanced by

769.79 --> 775.8499999999999
regular alcohol use for me and it's when

773.72 --> 778.76
the first things that I love to see go

775.85 --> 781.399
so that I never lose track of my train

778.76 --> 785.48
of thought again it's one of the things

781.399 --> 787.88
that really does influence it with

785.48 --> 789.35
complex issues that is you know easy

787.88 --> 791.959
trains of thought of very easy to

789.35 --> 793.73
maintain and you just grab it grab the

791.959 --> 795.41
feeling from someone else or someone

793.73 --> 798.259
else fills you in but when you really

795.41 --> 801.25
construct try to model out something in

798.259 --> 805.029
two dimensional extremely heavy

801.25 --> 808.399
consequences fractals and all that yeah

805.029 --> 810.86
you need some focus and that's when

808.399 --> 816.05
alcohol just makes you

810.86 --> 823.52
fizzle after a point just like there's

816.05 --> 828.7299999999999
less in the glass and I can just

823.52 --> 835.15
describe it just like that from I button

828.73 --> 835.15
they yeah over 24 hours not drinking

835.72 --> 841.96
more than that

837.4 --> 847.04
36 something like that so yeah anyway

841.96 --> 851.51
see where this goes and also I'm trying

847.04 --> 853.67
to figure out like how can I prevent now

851.51 --> 855.74
this yeah let's get more complex that's

853.67 --> 859.9699999999999
good totally are we an introspective

855.74 --> 861.59
fractal based right so yesterday I was

859.97 --> 867.5600000000001
basically in a moment where I was on

861.59 --> 869.5600000000001
attention to create to basically shoot

867.56 --> 872.2099999999999
myself in the foot somehow but

869.56 --> 877.0999999999999
energetically it's like I was so

872.21 --> 879.86
frustrated something needs to snap but

877.1 --> 883.25
yeah every way you do that you

879.86 --> 886.5500000000001
effectively grabble yourself did yeah

883.25 --> 888.95
it's a weird metaphor but you but it's

886.55 --> 892.9399999999999
something that like I had to do in some

888.95 --> 894.6800000000001
way it's like this tension needs to like

892.94 --> 899.9000000000001
I need something needs to be punished

894.68 --> 901.6899999999999
like that but if I do that then yeah but

899.9 --> 905.5699999999999
for the root reason you know not just

901.69 --> 909.1700000000001
somebody's gonna get it no no it's like

905.57 --> 913.88
it's like I guess not just like a sadism

909.17 --> 919.28
it's more like this like brutal craving

913.88 --> 922.04
for some kind of justice and it's like

919.28 --> 925.04
okay if I can't do that with the world

922.04 --> 928.61
I'll do it with myself but it has to be

925.04 --> 931.8199999999999
just in some way so then I basically use

928.61 --> 934.69
that extreme frustration extreme

931.82 --> 940.62
frustration becomes so extreme sometimes

934.69 --> 942.8100000000001
that I just get maniacally strict like

940.62 --> 945.78
thrown in front of the throne of God

942.81 --> 950.43
situation towards myself really that

945.78 --> 952.14
that level I did it is like a I can't

950.43 --> 954.12
explain what it is it's like something

952.14 --> 956.76
that I've just started doing instead of

954.12 --> 960.39
just damaging myself or just letting

956.76 --> 962.8199999999999
myself slip into disgustingness because

960.39 --> 965.1
it didn't matter somehow no no I chose

962.82 --> 968.36
to instead just put myself in front of

965.1 --> 971.28
the throne and just get all sadistic

968.36 --> 973.26
towards myself but in mind that it's

971.28 --> 980.01
supposed to be a punishment that will

973.26 --> 985.11
actually yield some fruit and that way

980.01 --> 991.8199999999999
yeah because I have always responded

985.11 --> 994.89
very well to I don't know to energetic

991.82 --> 998.7800000000001
Authority that's just that's guided by

994.89 --> 1002.75
spirit of justice and that has a good

998.78 --> 1005.3
will that has your wellness and growth

1002.75 --> 1008.54
in mind for real and not just as some

1005.3 --> 1011.15
kind of act to hold up for power that's

1008.54 --> 1013.5799999999999
I will was responded so well to that

1011.15 --> 1016.4599999999999
that's inflames me inspires me greatly

1013.58 --> 1019.76
so I kind of tried to do that towards

1016.46 --> 1024.41
myself due to a lack of level that

1019.76 --> 1026.93
people out there had they were most

1024.41 --> 1029.8600000000001
people out there are either morally

1026.93 --> 1035.5700000000002
sound very sound or the but then they

1029.86 --> 1039.59
that's offset by their intellect usually

1035.57 --> 1042.95
not reaching as far as I sometimes need

1039.59 --> 1045.1699999999998
and then you have other types of people

1042.95 --> 1048.44
that are kind of the counter opposite

1045.17 --> 1050.75
they are like freakin brilliant but they

1048.44 --> 1052.79
have problems with their moral insights

1050.75 --> 1056.42
it's like more difficult to them and

1052.79 --> 1059.06
it's interesting because they will

1056.42 --> 1063.0500000000002
gladly seek out somebody that'll get to

1059.06 --> 1066.6799999999998
their level intellectually and can then

1063.05 --> 1071.23
help out a lil with moral issues without

1066.68 --> 1075.3700000000001
getting like what is this you know

1071.23 --> 1082.8600000000001
and yeah so I'm kind of cut in this

1075.37 --> 1087.79
position between a spectrum of types

1082.86 --> 1091.33
like the morally very sound and

1087.79 --> 1093.79
intellectually has to be good enough

1091.33 --> 1099.309
none of them are and then like the

1093.79 --> 1101.74
really like high tech thinkers that have

1099.309 --> 1104.4289999999999
moral problems it's very typical that

1101.74 --> 1107.95
this is but how that kind of

1104.429 --> 1111.4
crystallizes because great intellect

1107.95 --> 1113.65
brings so many moral obstacles that just

1111.4 --> 1116.1100000000001
have to be bypassed in order for you to

1113.65 --> 1119.2900000000002
just understand how to [ __ ] things work

1116.11 --> 1121.99
it's more about the oversight and less

1119.29 --> 1125.559
about the consequent that's effectively

1121.99 --> 1127.75
what happens it's inevitable and then it

1125.559 --> 1129.6399999999999
becomes much more difficult to weigh it

1127.75 --> 1132.669
out morally and yeah if you're all

1129.64 --> 1136.0900000000001
fixated on figuring things out then

1132.669 --> 1139.419
usually that becomes your focus and the

1136.09 --> 1142.6299999999999
moral is left slipping a little over

1139.419 --> 1144.7900000000002
time the roughly you know it's not for

1142.63 --> 1146.38
everyone there but probably people out

1144.79 --> 1150.33
there that have a perfect balance

1146.38 --> 1150.3300000000002
between intellect and moral nature

1153.74 --> 1166.97
but yeah I don't know I just the other

1163.789 --> 1169.64
types typically stand out to me but

1166.97 --> 1172.34
maybe it is also because they seek some

1169.64 --> 1177.1100000000001
of the other side to help much because

1172.34 --> 1181.01
people seek out oh yeah

1177.11 --> 1183.559
other talents in people too

1181.01 --> 1185.24
it's like we need some that we need some

1183.559 --> 1189.11
of that insight we need some of that

1185.24 --> 1191.0
good spirit we need some of that morale

1189.11 --> 1193.279
boost or just the happiness that

1191.0 --> 1195.679
somebody radiates you know that is what

1193.279 --> 1199.429
we seek out in others and we seek out to

1195.679 --> 1202.73
balance our own shortcomings in that or

1199.429 --> 1206.0800000000002
just as a social process just to get you

1202.73 --> 1206.08
going it all depends

1208.52 --> 1212.9
[Music]

1216.65 --> 1219.709

month right and I've been very careful

1269.15 --> 1280.68
yeah it's yeah I still need to keep it

1275.7 --> 1288.3300000000002
going anyway wisely addiction is a

1280.68 --> 1290.91
mistress right Robin Stanley and the

1288.33 --> 1293.4499999999998
same goes that mistresses can be very

1290.91 --> 1293.45
addictive

1308.52 --> 1315.59
I'm enjoying bath can you give us his

1313.05 --> 1315.59
background

1317.6 --> 1325.4499999999998

1379.65 --> 1390.45
not a champion at names who exactly is

1384.48 --> 1392.039
that the level gentlemen oh by the way

1390.45 --> 1395.03
thank you or Rob Wiggles for the five

1392.039 --> 1395.03
told us to preach a donation

1401.059 --> 1405.619
is he one of the guys that comes in

1403.189 --> 1412.249
there has been coming in like more

1405.619 --> 1415.7189999999998
recently in the last few months it was

1412.249 --> 1415.719
in with sleeping warrior

1418.52 --> 1421.3
okay

1421.88 --> 1430.0100000000002
right okay so it's that guy yeah sorry

1426.26 --> 1432.2
I'm I'm so bad at names I can literally

1430.01 --> 1435.049
be hanging around with people on a daily

1432.2 --> 1436.64
basis and then after half a year find

1435.049 --> 1437.559
out that you have no clue what their

1436.64 --> 1440.0300000000002
names are

1437.559 --> 1442.549
but I'll recognize the face I'll

1440.03 --> 1447.799
recognize the voice I'll figure out how

1442.549 --> 1453.46
they are oh yeah by the name is I have

1447.799 --> 1463.01
no idea I'm so sucky at names sometimes

1453.46 --> 1465.32
on am i UK okay didn't see that but if

1463.01 --> 1471.919
it is who I think it is yeah he has a

1465.32 --> 1474.8899999999999
pretty smooth gentle voice like when he

1471.919 --> 1480.939
talks things do tend to calm down

1474.89 --> 1480.939
[Music]

1483.99 --> 1493.16
ooh right fractal escape

1497.06 --> 1503.1699999999998
yeah well addiction you know there's

1499.58 --> 1505.61
different levels within addiction

1503.17 --> 1509.99
something can be addicting and it'll

1505.61 --> 1512.1799999999998
just draw your attention but like the

1509.99 --> 1517.01
nefarious types of addictions are the

1512.18 --> 1519.71
one the ones that you at first probably

1517.01 --> 1522.65
use in a traumatising situation it's

1519.71 --> 1526.19
like a mechanism that's fueled by

1522.65 --> 1528.3700000000001
escapism and then turns out that you're

1526.19 --> 1531.68
something that you're really good at

1528.37 --> 1537.6799999999998
what you're using to escape in then it

1531.68 --> 1542.8400000000001
becomes like a real serious potentially

1537.68 --> 1545.03
serious dangerous addiction because then

1542.84 --> 1548.47
you're using it to escape and that has

1545.03 --> 1548.47
an extra effect on it

1557.56 --> 1561.97
then that see as I explained earlier

1559.39 --> 1566.7900000000002
that's obviously what alcoholism

1561.97 --> 1572.56
typically does it's definitely an escape

1566.79 --> 1575.6499999999999
and in a way temporarily but yes the

1572.56 --> 1579.25
whole cycle and all that it's it's

1575.65 --> 1583.15
always temporary but very effectively

1579.25 --> 1587.19
helps suppress those things and that's

1583.15 --> 1587.19
why it is such a serious addiction

1587.34 --> 1593.4299999999998
because any serious addiction is always

1589.87 --> 1600.55
fuel at the core by some form of yeah

1593.43 --> 1601.38
chronic escapism inability to confront

1600.55 --> 1606.229
something

1601.38 --> 1606.229
[Music]

1610.05 --> 1617.43
hear me yeah yeah bye bet I bet we would

1614.97 --> 1618.24
I'd love to have him on on the panel

1617.43 --> 1620.43
here sometimes

1618.24 --> 1623.58
Robin Stanley that's a good idea maybe

1620.43 --> 1629.6000000000001
I'll ask him if he comes on the show

1623.58 --> 1629.6
live over at the Flat Earth debates

1657.48 --> 1662.52
[Music]

1659.81 --> 1665.48
you just like that [ __ ] and got caught

1662.52 --> 1665.48
up in the game

1668.95 --> 1673.9
now but that's not really I don't know

1671.86 --> 1676.4799999999998
in a way that's not an addiction then

1673.9 --> 1680.1000000000001
it's just a catalyzer and now coal can

1676.48 --> 1684.07
be a catalyzer definitely loosens you up

1680.1 --> 1689.32
may it might make you indulge in things

1684.07 --> 1691.27
you normally wouldn't but then it's not

1689.32 --> 1695.05
the addiction that's not a really

1691.27 --> 1699.37
alcohol addiction that's just like wow

1695.05 --> 1701.05
that could be like sin addiction sexual

1699.37 --> 1702.9099999999999
addiction all kinds but it's usually not

1701.05 --> 1705.3999999999999
than the alcohol so the alcohol would

1702.91 --> 1710.8600000000001
then only be the catalyzer it's not the

1705.4 --> 1711.3400000000001
same thing for me it is like that as

1710.86 --> 1713.26
well

1711.34 --> 1716.32
it's very much a catalyzer because it

1713.26 --> 1718.33
loosens me up but at the same time it

1716.32 --> 1721.9299999999998
also eventually starts to take away my

1718.33 --> 1728.77
intellect slightly takes the edge off

1721.93 --> 1730.27
literally edge of my thinking and that

1728.77 --> 1732.16
makes it kind of comfortable because

1730.27 --> 1734.8
then that edge of my thinking doesn't

1732.16 --> 1737.5500000000002
disturb me as much but at the same time

1734.8 --> 1742.29
I just don't manifest as effectively

1737.55 --> 1742.29
when I try to put something down

1757.59 --> 1761.6299999999999
that that's weird or oven Stanley

1762.64 --> 1769.93
childhood accident no muscle memory of

1765.64 --> 1772.5400000000002
serine dr. nation well I don't know

1769.93 --> 1776.26
extreme trauma yeah like if serious

1772.54 --> 1778.36
accident could could do that like think

1776.26 --> 1781.21
of it like this in a way it is kind of

1778.36 --> 1785.1699999999998
like the indoctrination does have like

1781.21 --> 1787.78
slight trauma at least in involved with

1785.17 --> 1790.3300000000002
that so yeah a trauma what is it is a

1787.78 --> 1792.34
shock and then a susceptibility to it

1790.33 --> 1796.54
and then it sinks in and then it heals

1792.34 --> 1800.32
up and then if the indoctrination is

1796.54 --> 1804.01
placed then it just heals up over it and

1800.32 --> 1808.6299999999999
just sticks there till something pokes

1804.01 --> 1810.79
it well if he would have just sort of

1808.63 --> 1813.7600000000002
been in that phase at school that he

1810.79 --> 1815.9099999999999
learned that [ __ ] and then after God an

1813.76 --> 1819.8799999999999
accident well then an accident trauma

1815.91 --> 1823.15
would definitely shockwave away any type

1819.88 --> 1825.16
of influences or could or couldn't it

1823.15 --> 1829.89
totally enhance it if and it's like it

1825.16 --> 1833.23
that's kind of unpredictable I think

1829.89 --> 1837.0700000000002
it's like it could imply it or it could

1833.23 --> 1842.02
erase it the effect so yeah that could

1837.07 --> 1844.3899999999999
be a thing interesting I don't know it's

1842.02 --> 1846.6399999999999
like this weird kooky old story about

1844.39 --> 1848.2
the the knock on your head and you lose

1846.64 --> 1850.51
your memory and then you get a knock

1848.2 --> 1853.51
back and you get your memory back it's

1850.51 --> 1855.1
almost like yeah the well that's a very

1853.51 --> 1858.36
kooky version of that

1855.1 --> 1858.36
don't try it out

1861.35 --> 1867.86
but yeah if there's like a trauma-based

1864.409 --> 1870.2890000000002
thing implanted or imprinted on you and

1867.86 --> 1872.2099999999998
then something else happens that's like

1870.289 --> 1878.149
worse or much more shocking much more

1872.21 --> 1880.929
visceral personal physical shock then

1878.149 --> 1885.83
yeah any imprint that was there before

1880.929 --> 1888.44
will simply or could fade away in the

1885.83 --> 1892.6589999999999
face of that shock or it could enhance

1888.44 --> 1892.659
even more you don't really know for sure

1898.01 --> 1901.1299999999999
[Music]

1912.2 --> 1919.41
yep Missouri bear well that's kind of

1917.13 --> 1922.0800000000002
like our smoked cannabis ice well

1919.41 --> 1924.66
cannabis all throughout just this

1922.08 --> 1928.8899999999999
background feeling like I live in a

1924.66 --> 1930.63
satanic Empire and everybody that smart

1928.89 --> 1933.66
that I talked to seems to agree that

1930.63 --> 1936.5400000000002
that's the better thing and now that is

1933.66 --> 1938.73
sort of an exaggeration but I did like

1936.54 --> 1940.98
literally get that type of answer

1938.73 --> 1942.99
sometimes here and there and then when

1940.98 --> 1945.06
you just hear it sporadically among

1942.99 --> 1949.68
people including those you've never met

1945.06 --> 1951.6599999999999
that shocks you so bad it's like it

1949.68 --> 1955.5
stopped me so bad that to me it was feel

1951.66 --> 1959.64
like holy [ __ ] they're all they're all

1955.5 --> 1963.75
satanic I wonder if they truly realize

1959.64 --> 1966.3000000000002
it even but yeah that's like in a way

1963.75 --> 1970.92
that's like a self like a response when

1966.3 --> 1976.49
that thing wasn't even a thing yet it's

1970.92 --> 1982.17
just because of like how easily people

1976.49 --> 1988.14
have learned to just say absurd

1982.17 --> 1990.9
outrageous things like it like that

1988.14 --> 1993.0
doesn't do anything and that if somebody

1990.9 --> 1997.5600000000002
does actually take it serious it's so

1993.0 --> 1999.72
shocking but they are probably saying it

1997.56 --> 2000.98
because they're just not listening to

1999.72 --> 2003.23
what they're saying they don't really

2000.98 --> 2006.83
care this think that it's just something

2003.23 --> 2008.54
if you say that then it's cool or then

2006.83 --> 2010.25
yeah even though it is firstly

2008.54 --> 2013.25
discussing that listen to what you're

2010.25 --> 2016.7
saying just say it because then you get

2013.25 --> 2020.12
a plus point on your social credit type

2016.7 --> 2024.22
of feel because some people do it like

2020.12 --> 2027.53
that it's really sick and they don't

2024.22 --> 2029.48
think about what they're doing when they

2027.53 --> 2033.17
do it and they don't think about it

2029.48 --> 2035.42
afterward either and that's what I've

2033.17 --> 2039.41
been confronted with a lot and then yeah

2035.42 --> 2041.03
I started smoking kind of more to escape

2039.41 --> 2042.95
from that the problem was it didn't

2041.03 --> 2044.21
really help because it made me just more

2042.95 --> 2047.6190000000001
sensitive and

2044.21 --> 2050.51
if I then go out and get with people I

2047.619 --> 2053.899
get even more confronted with it's out

2050.51 --> 2057.079
kind of panic fired at it it was like a

2053.899 --> 2059.149
crazy inward spiral type situation that

2057.079 --> 2066.2000000000003
I just didn't have under control back

2059.149 --> 2068.45
then and if I would have gone like drink

2066.2 --> 2070.25
irregularly that it would have been the

2068.45 --> 2072.319
other way around that I'd probably just

2070.25 --> 2075.53
got dragged into it and that'd be it

2072.319 --> 2077.5099999999998
like a full-blown alcoholic now probably

2075.53 --> 2079.8190000000004
had a lot more money than also and

2077.51 --> 2084.679
probably be a lot more disgusting in

2079.819 --> 2087.29
some ways and not caring about it that's

2084.679 --> 2089.329
yeah but instead I went for the cannabis

2087.29 --> 2094.359
it made me more sensitive it just made

2089.329 --> 2096.559
me more tortured as well effectively

2094.359 --> 2099.92
that's not because of the cannabis

2096.559 --> 2103.19
that's because of what basically that

2099.92 --> 2105.5
rolled into and just like aggravating

2103.19 --> 2108.67
the contrast with society and their

2105.5 --> 2113.63
immoral nature and me desperately

2108.67 --> 2116.69
seeking for some traces of yeah and

2113.63 --> 2119.059
polluted spirit and it made me seek out

2116.69 --> 2122.119
nature a lot more like really

2119.059 --> 2124.549
desperately like is like please let

2122.119 --> 2130.28
there be something uncorrupted in some

2124.549 --> 2132.02
way like yeah man this sounds really

2130.28 --> 2137.3900000000003
dark and all that but yeah that's where

2132.02 --> 2140.829
my mind dwelt at times it's not like

2137.39 --> 2140.8289999999997
that anymore not by a long shot

2143.49 --> 2152.54
I dwelled in in yeah in dark ground

2149.94 --> 2152.54
sometimes

2169.49 --> 2175.62
the right Missouri bear well with some

2172.77 --> 2177.48
of the the people that I described that

2175.62 --> 2178.77
literally don't know what the [ __ ]

2177.48 --> 2181.95
they're talking about and they say

2178.77 --> 2186.12
outrageous things and all that [ __ ] if

2181.95 --> 2188.87
you'd literally address them solidly on

2186.12 --> 2191.58
morality it's like if you got to them

2188.87 --> 2193.89
it's almost 100% certain that they'd

2191.58 --> 2201.87
either go berserk or they'd burst out

2193.89 --> 2209.79
crying that's really how they get to

2201.87 --> 2212.22
that position and that's why almost

2209.79 --> 2214.14
nobody confronts them anymore because

2212.22 --> 2216.5099999999998
they go berserk and the problem is they

2214.14 --> 2218.73
need to almost like do that to try to

2216.51 --> 2222.48
get over it and then try to figure it

2218.73 --> 2224.4
out again but they give up and yeah when

2222.48 --> 2226.23
they give up and have all the extreme

2224.4 --> 2230.4300000000003
symptoms and everybody around them is

2226.23 --> 2233.25
not really gonna make them do it you

2230.43 --> 2237.1099999999997
know this is a mistake that early on I

2233.25 --> 2240.12
oh yeah that I almost persisted in I

2237.11 --> 2240.7200000000003
kind of crawl out of that in my early

2240.12 --> 2243.27
20s

2240.72 --> 2245.8799999999997
and I really figured out like this does

2243.27 --> 2248.55
not work if you give up and you want

2245.88 --> 2255.87
others desperately to drag you out they

2248.55 --> 2259.1000000000004
want because you have to do it even if

2255.87 --> 2259.1
you think it's totally impossible

2262.5 --> 2270.96
and then if you just set it to it then

2266.49 --> 2272.85
eventually like signs of help will slip

2270.96 --> 2275.75
through and then eventually you'll find

2272.85 --> 2279.5699999999997
the route the ride grounds where people

2275.75 --> 2281.97
are just like almost ready to just help

2279.57 --> 2284.54
on the spot without any problem they'll

2281.97 --> 2287.7
see it as a plus they'll see it as

2284.54 --> 2289.89
getting paid people will help you

2287.7 --> 2292.29
because they will feel it is like they

2289.89 --> 2294.54
are getting paid and this is a sensation

2292.29 --> 2296.61
that I undergo as well and you seek

2294.54 --> 2306.12
those grounds and you seek those people

2296.61 --> 2307.9500000000003
and then ya suddenly from a place where

2306.12 --> 2309.5099999999998
you're completely isolated and you got

2307.95 --> 2314.25
nothing suddenly you got all these

2309.51 --> 2315.03
people that ya that a big battle just

2314.25 --> 2318.24
shares

2315.03 --> 2322.3700000000003
they'll just share their skills they'll

2318.24 --> 2325.02
like give you all these precious things

2322.37 --> 2327.2599999999998
intellectually and even like a little

2325.02 --> 2330.36
bit of social energies little little

2327.26 --> 2333.9900000000002
support that whole swathes of other

2330.36 --> 2336.9300000000003
people don't have to share and when

2333.99 --> 2338.97
they're approached about it about hey

2336.93 --> 2339.75
maybe you should be a little bit nicer

2338.97 --> 2345.9599999999996
or anything

2339.75 --> 2349.05
they'll be outraged I was among those

2345.96 --> 2352.53
types as well there's a lot of them

2349.05 --> 2354.4500000000003
among like liberals and atheists they're

2352.53 --> 2358.23
just among them and they're used to it

2354.45 --> 2361.23
and they don't really check each other

2358.23 --> 2365.61
upon that type of behavior it's super

2361.23 --> 2370.08
polluting to me now this scene with

2365.61 --> 2372.5
bears and flat-earthers and yeah there's

2370.08 --> 2378.5099999999998
a wide range of people that absolutely

2372.5 --> 2383.0
exclude that and that's kind of like a

2378.51 --> 2383.0
group that I feel I belong to

2384.76 --> 2397.7000000000003
and I'm glad to collect them in my chat

2388.9 --> 2405.92
and among my among my members and among

2397.7 --> 2408.25
channels that I follow okay YouTube sure

2405.92 --> 2408.25
Oh

2408.52 --> 2413.2599999999998
bitcoins journey is not over yet

2416.86 --> 2439.01
good go all kinds of places you take

2422.9 --> 2451.34
good service baby sharing - yeah doing

2439.01 --> 2454.36
good anybody follow the toxic souls or

2451.34 --> 2454.36
heartbreaking to me yup

2457.349 --> 2464.969
well and Robin Stanley I have a another

2460.89 --> 2469.259
element to me and that is that very

2464.969 --> 2474.66
inefficiently they bring out sadism in

2469.259 --> 2479.69
me as well but I can literally just stop

2474.66 --> 2484.2889999999998
like not respond to that but it's like

2479.69 --> 2486.69
because of the how sensitive I am it's

2484.289 --> 2491.369
like their presence is literally like a

2486.69 --> 2494.489
stain on my energy this sounds really

2491.369 --> 2503.4300000000003
bad you know it's like I want to

2494.489 --> 2507.2690000000002
exterminate them that's yeah but it's no

2503.43 --> 2510.299
use and and yeah like every time I feel

2507.269 --> 2514.319
that it's like yeah remember I wouldn't

2510.299 --> 2516.719
remember you had that exact radiance and

2514.319 --> 2520.949
that attitude and all the cowardice and

2516.719 --> 2524.719
all that [ __ ] you had it too so you want

2520.949 --> 2530.13
to kill them you want to kill you Arwen

2524.719 --> 2532.949
you know but then again yeah maybe that

2530.13 --> 2537.089
is why it is also very painful to me

2532.949 --> 2542.219
because I did undergo it myself back

2537.089 --> 2544.049
then and like yeah it's like upon the

2542.219 --> 2546.059
moments where I realized that it would

2544.049 --> 2550.2889999999998
literally be like somebody was just

2546.059 --> 2555.299
carving into my soul so painful so

2550.289 --> 2561.6600000000003
shameful sensation I don't like to be

2555.299 --> 2563.16
reminded about that yeah and that's why

2561.66 --> 2566.569
I don't like those types of people that

2563.16 --> 2566.569
go there and then piss me off

2569.3 --> 2575.67
and then again if those people are like

2572.25 --> 2577.56
help me I know this is bad can you

2575.67 --> 2582.48
please help me I'm trying to be better

2577.56 --> 2584.73
well that'll then bring tears to my eyes

2582.48 --> 2586.92
almost instantly because it's like God

2584.73 --> 2590.19
they are trying Oh God

2586.92 --> 2593.099
because that's I was there too one time

2590.19 --> 2596.119
and I was seemed absolutely worthless

2593.099 --> 2599.67
and hopeless and people I hated myself

2596.119 --> 2602.76
but I did that too and look where I'm I

2599.67 --> 2606.81
am now it's yeah from matter of

2602.76 --> 2610.44
perspective but compared to for myself

2606.81 --> 2617.91
to how I was like 15 years ago in I am

2610.44 --> 2621.329
now it's my energies so much better so

2617.91 --> 2624.1499999999996
glad that I that I just kept scrubbing

2621.329 --> 2626.4900000000002
it kept scrubbing it keeping it clean

2624.15 --> 2630.06
don't let it get dirty and really get

2626.49 --> 2631.95
perfectionist at it funny thing is is

2630.06 --> 2637.17
that I did I haven't done a lot of like

2631.95 --> 2641.31
scrubbing cleaning work - and it's

2637.17 --> 2643.2000000000003
interesting how that yeah anybody that

2641.31 --> 2645.45
knows about that effect it's like if

2643.2 --> 2647.91
you're really super Restless or you feel

2645.45 --> 2650.8489999999997
completely like [ __ ] now for a lot of

2647.91 --> 2654.27
people like rigorously cleaning your

2650.849 --> 2656.4300000000003
room and [ __ ] and or ordering things can

2654.27 --> 2659.52
be they're very therapeutical and like

2656.43 --> 2662.64
reflect upon your soul like that well

2659.52 --> 2664.71
for me that works as well and that's why

2662.64 --> 2666.48
I have done a lot of cleaning it's

2664.71 --> 2668.4
really because of that not because of

2666.48 --> 2671.19
like oh yeah I want to be cleaner no I

2668.4 --> 2678.619
actually kind of hate cleaning but when

2671.19 --> 2683.579
I need to do it I love it it's always so

2678.619 --> 2685.71
reliable when it's like 100% or 0% and

2683.579 --> 2691.78
just randomly switches between you know

2685.71 --> 2694.84
such a stable situation - Billa

2691.78 --> 2697.8700000000003
well to just get by living it's

2694.84 --> 2699.67
perfectly fine but yeah when you see try

2697.87 --> 2702.7799999999997
to find some kind of profession with it

2699.67 --> 2702.78
that doesn't work well

2707.34 --> 2710.449
[Music]

2729.45 --> 2733.5299999999997
to live in today's well that free is a

2732.21 --> 2736.619
miracle in itself

2733.53 --> 2738.26
oh it is gonna be a miracle if literally

2736.619 --> 2740.9100000000003
before even born there's just

2738.26 --> 2743.7000000000003
technically money stolen from you

2740.91 --> 2745.5
through government bailouts and [ __ ] and

2743.7 --> 2748.0499999999997
just hand it to people and then you have

2745.5 --> 2755.04
to make it back even though it doesn't

2748.05 --> 2757.53
directly seem like that so yeah money

2755.04 --> 2760.109
that is that we are bound to is already

2757.53 --> 2763.849
being spent and with some people even

2760.109 --> 2769.25
before they're born but yeah that's all

2763.849 --> 2772.9100000000003
basically judicial technicals is that

2769.25 --> 2776.13
how real is that now that's a bit of a

2772.91 --> 2777.5299999999997
sparring match that can last you a

2776.13 --> 2780.9300000000003
lifetime

2777.53 --> 2785.76
because it is still it's not absolutely

2780.93 --> 2791.22
written in stone it's a system and you

2785.76 --> 2794.4900000000002
can kind of push that system away a

2791.22 --> 2797.609
little but not without consequences like

2794.49 --> 2801.9199999999996
because that system also provides some

2797.609 --> 2801.92
benefits making things easier

2814.98 --> 2822.19
yeah well fractal escape just imagine

2819.119 --> 2827.2000000000003
what the world would be like if there

2822.19 --> 2829.0
were no cleaners so wait there are

2827.2 --> 2832.089
places like that it's called the third

2829.0 --> 2834.19
world there's even some cleaners there

2832.089 --> 2840.869
it's just that it's the absolute bare

2834.19 --> 2844.77
minimum or everybody would die but yeah

2840.869 --> 2844.77
cleaners matter a lot

2853.52 --> 2859.28
cleaners basically keep the dizzies away

2859.79 --> 2865.97
maybe just as much as the doctor is

2863.28 --> 2865.9700000000003
supposed to

2870.58 --> 2873.7599999999998
[Music]

2878.95 --> 2885.6499999999996
right and I would categorize plumbers

2881.69 --> 2891.38
right next to that by the way it's very

2885.65 --> 2897.099
bordering like without cleaners and

2891.38 --> 2897.099
plumbers any civilization is just [ __ ]

2926.23 --> 2928.83
it

2934.26 --> 2941.2900000000004
that's an odd question to ask Missouri

2937.03 --> 2946.9300000000003
bear it's all a number game you know

2941.29 --> 2949.69
with the money it's all promissory notes

2946.93 --> 2956.6499999999996
and the promissory notes effectively

2949.69 --> 2959.5
with what's called monetary policy the

2956.65 --> 2962.619
printing press it is effectively okay

2959.5 --> 2967.63
the bank sets the value based on the

2962.619 --> 2970.329
promise of productivity that do they

2967.63 --> 2973.9
will effect because they basically have

2970.329 --> 2976.27
the value enhance by the ability to

2973.9 --> 2977.98
print it it's a very bizarre situation

2976.27 --> 2986.68
that what people probably don't really

2977.98 --> 2994.18
realize how this technically works so

2986.68 --> 2999.22
they determine the value of money based

2994.18 --> 3006.29
on what they think the people can

2999.22 --> 3012.6899999999996
produce and they then maneuver

3006.29 --> 3014.13
accordingly to that plan so every time

3012.69 --> 3018.54
there's like huge bay lights it's

3014.13 --> 3020.76
basically yeah like a vote of confidence

3018.54 --> 3024.39
for the bank's like oh yeah sure they

3020.76 --> 3026.88
all make it back overlooking of course

3024.39 --> 3029.73
like the the grave percentage of debt

3026.88 --> 3032.76
that's just gonna disappear into their

3029.73 --> 3036.329
pockets yeah it's the out of control

3032.76 --> 3040.0200000000004
balance of the preponderance of the debt

3036.329 --> 3041.13
and all that overlooking that it's still

3040.02 --> 3044.52
like yeah sure

3041.13 --> 3046.29
or maybe yeah that doesn't then it's

3044.52 --> 3049.109
kind of broken okay let me put it

3046.29 --> 3051.27
another way if those thing if the if it

3049.109 --> 3054.81
wasn't out of balance if it wasn't like

3051.27 --> 3058.829
a private bank so there was only debt to

3054.81 --> 3061.349
pay back to itself then it would be like

3058.829 --> 3063.6600000000003
a photo of confidence it wouldn't be

3061.349 --> 3065.579
just a heist plan like oh yeah let's

3063.66 --> 3065.92
just make give them more debt because

3065.579 --> 3068.71
that's

3065.92 --> 3070.2400000000002
kind of know-how works with this as long

3068.71 --> 3075.04
as this isn't it's in place the way it

3070.24 --> 3077.6499999999996
is but if it would be a more honest that

3075.04 --> 3082.119
based system directly like a National

3077.65 --> 3085.2400000000002
Bank situation then it would be yeah a

3082.119 --> 3090.79
promissory note in the sense that yeah

3085.24 --> 3094.2
it's valued so much because we think you

3090.79 --> 3097.75
can make it that valuable and we're just

3094.2 --> 3099.8799999999997
gonna give the value to you ahead of

3097.75 --> 3103.869
time sort of but it's still virtually

3099.88 --> 3106.51
based on that it will be valuable it's

3103.869 --> 3112.75
us I don't know maybe I'm like getting

3106.51 --> 3115.119
lost here and the train of thought but

3112.75 --> 3116.589
yeah that's the weird thing about the

3115.119 --> 3119.559
debt based system where they can just

3116.589 --> 3121.599
write money out of nothing where they

3119.559 --> 3126.42
can conjure it when you realize that

3121.599 --> 3132.19
it's supposed to be offset value that is

3126.42 --> 3135.4900000000002
exchanged and stored well because they

3132.19 --> 3138.309
are capable of changing the yet the

3135.49 --> 3142.24
total value of everything whatever they

3138.309 --> 3144.9100000000003
do is based on their prospects of where

3142.24 --> 3148.1699999999996
where it could go and if the people

3144.91 --> 3151.569
could maintain it maintain the debt and

3148.17 --> 3155.2000000000003
the extra fundings that they'll have to

3151.569 --> 3157.38
pay back right I think I got that one

3155.2 --> 3157.3799999999997
right

3166.4 --> 3170.809
while Missouri bear it's a matter of

3168.319 --> 3175.029
perspective you know a bank can be

3170.809 --> 3178.549
fantastic in a productive society that's

3175.029 --> 3181.7
properly educated not gravel to all hell

3178.549 --> 3184.91
and poison to death and [ __ ] through

3181.7 --> 3187.0989999999997
all kinds of influences right the

3184.91 --> 3188.779
society is doing great then the bank is

3187.099 --> 3192.44
a great blessing it makes things

3188.779 --> 3194.63
suddenly possible and yeah it will be

3192.44 --> 3199.069
paid back because any real sensible

3194.63 --> 3203.7400000000002
progress will yield more fruits then it

3199.069 --> 3206.9
costs but if everybody's all screwed up

3203.74 --> 3209.45
then it just becomes more debt because

3206.9 --> 3211.1600000000003
it's almost inevitable that if

3209.45 --> 3214.1899999999996
everybody's all screwed up and stupid

3211.16 --> 3216.3089999999997
they're not gonna be able to wisely

3214.19 --> 3221.809
invest it in something that'll help

3216.309 --> 3225.46
yield more fruits see how that works it

3221.809 --> 3230.9300000000003
all depends so it is the people the bank

3225.46 --> 3234.71
actually is the people it's just shown

3230.93 --> 3240.41
like they are separate it's it's really

3234.71 --> 3245.9900000000002
a giant control trick it's crazy how

3240.41 --> 3248.029
long that's worth but yeah that control

3245.99 --> 3249.02
trick can also be like yeah yeah your

3248.029 --> 3251.66
guys are doing great

3249.02 --> 3254.809
oh look at all this money you have all

3251.66 --> 3256.43
this money please go do something now

3254.809 --> 3258.3390000000004
and actually make that money please

3256.43 --> 3262.069
please

3258.339 --> 3264.02
instead of Wow the bankers there is like

3262.069 --> 3267.619
whoa this is like a really productive

3264.02 --> 3269.809
crowd yeah it's gonna be easy you know a

3267.619 --> 3274.339
really productive crowd to a banker is

3269.809 --> 3277.2200000000003
like wow that's yeah sure I'll lend out

3274.339 --> 3279.2
as much money as I possibly can because

3277.22 --> 3281.45
I'm absolutely certain that these people

3279.2 --> 3284.39
are so good and productive and wise that

3281.45 --> 3288.319
they will make it back for sure you know

3284.39 --> 3290.19
that's a completely different setup see

3288.319 --> 3292.68
how that works

3290.19 --> 3297.2400000000002
I don't even know why I know all this

3292.68 --> 3300.96
[ __ ] I've never been a banker I guess

3297.24 --> 3303.95
that I've talked to the bank or certain

3300.96 --> 3306.75
individual as a banker

3303.95 --> 3309.6
talk to him directly about it a lot but

3306.75 --> 3314.94
I don't know how that works man tangled

3309.6 --> 3319.46
up with some weird [ __ ] there this is

3314.94 --> 3330.9
yeah this is how it is that's the bank

3319.46 --> 3333.21
you know I invented banking did I oh hey

3330.9 --> 3335.9100000000003
Chad the Dutch isn't it officially you

3333.21 --> 3338.58
know officially the Dutch invented

3335.91 --> 3340.6499999999996
banking but maybe that's more I think

3338.58 --> 3342.63
that probably the Vatican really

3340.65 --> 3345.6
originally invented that is not true

3342.63 --> 3350.37
banking was probably invented before

3345.6 --> 3352.74
writing was even invented but yeah

3350.37 --> 3354.96
officially according to history the

3352.74 --> 3359.1499999999996
Dutch invented banking but it could be

3354.96 --> 3363.21
said that the Dutch invented banking

3359.15 --> 3366.03
options for citizenry I think that is

3363.21 --> 3368.4900000000002
really it's they invented banking

3366.03 --> 3370.5
availability for a citizenry because

3368.49 --> 3372.6
then it was national banking it was the

3370.5 --> 3376.11
nation that was the bank so it's like

3372.6 --> 3379.7999999999997
giving the Siddons free opportunity

3376.11 --> 3382.08
through money lending you know that and

3379.8 --> 3385.77
that is that's a crushing way to start

3382.08 --> 3388.29
it so yeah I always liked that story

3385.77 --> 3390.87
it's nothing like what's happening now

3388.29 --> 3395.09
in the world because people were just

3390.87 --> 3395.0899999999997
ready to get it going

3399.22 --> 3402.8799999999997
[Music]

3402.92 --> 3409.14
and they did the Dutch went all around

3405.57 --> 3412.7000000000003
the world such a tiny country and we've

3409.14 --> 3415.2599999999998
been around the world I was everywhere

3412.7 --> 3420.33
remember New York was originally called

3415.26 --> 3423.8700000000003
New Amsterdam and we have a lasting good

3420.33 --> 3427.68
relation with Japan we were like the

3423.87 --> 3430.3199999999997
first to diplom eyes to go into

3427.68 --> 3433.3999999999996
diplomacy effectively with Japan like

3430.32 --> 3436.65
the first outside nation like in history

3433.4 --> 3439.26
as far as that history I don't know you

3436.65 --> 3442.94
know that could have also been graveled

3439.26 --> 3447.05
yeah the Dutch did also have grab ler

3442.94 --> 3451.43
elements entangled with them you know

3447.05 --> 3455.0600000000004
space program they don't know that but

3451.43 --> 3457.44
yeah that was a thing back then I'm

3455.06 --> 3461.7599999999998
banking also allowed that banking

3457.44 --> 3465.03
allowed private tears people would buy

3461.76 --> 3468.3
ships go out in world and trade the [ __ ]

3465.03 --> 3471.75
out of the place and do it effective

3468.3 --> 3474.3
with in like person doing personal

3471.75 --> 3477.63
banking things also like traders would

3474.3 --> 3481.9500000000003
be their own kind of personal bankers in

3477.63 --> 3485.79
the outside world they would bank in the

3481.95 --> 3491.16
other countries and then they would have

3485.79 --> 3493.2
to eventually pay taxes I think I don't

3491.16 --> 3497.49
know how it works probably to the Dutch

3493.2 --> 3505.1
king queen and then there'd be damn it I

3497.49 --> 3509.1899999999996
hate taxes because of course but yeah

3505.1 --> 3511.71
back then banking was still just it was

3509.19 --> 3514.8
the answer to an age where people were

3511.71 --> 3518.82
ready to crush and to do stuff had a lot

3514.8 --> 3520.71
of spirit an opportunity now it's all

3518.82 --> 3524.4900000000002
yeah when everybody's all screwed up and

3520.71 --> 3526.26
I'll dumb and just oh yeah all that

3524.49 --> 3530.66
money's not gonna do [ __ ] the people are

3526.26 --> 3530.6600000000003
not gonna be like okay because of it

3543.31 --> 3548.08
West Coast of Australia was called New

3545.59 --> 3550.3900000000003
Holland oh I didn't know that huh

3548.08 --> 3553.109
I didn't even know that one that's

3550.39 --> 3553.109
interesting right

3554.859 --> 3563.02
yeah and we had a we had colonies we had

3558.73 --> 3566.23
colonies the old Dutch days people

3563.02 --> 3570.19
wouldn't be so whoops talk about that

3566.23 --> 3575.14
but yeah we did we did have pseudonym in

3570.19 --> 3579.369
the the north northern part of South

3575.14 --> 3583.859
America and we had Indonesia it's a

3579.369 --> 3589.09
pretty decent country to have and I

3583.859 --> 3591.8489999999997
think it earlier on also South Africa so

3589.09 --> 3598.54
yeah literally we had like our Dutch

3591.849 --> 3600.9900000000002
haven in every continent really it's

3598.54 --> 3600.99
pretty cool

3604.619 --> 3610.2400000000002
because yeah that makes acted like if

3607.72 --> 3611.89
you want to be a trade faring nation

3610.24 --> 3615.1899999999996
that's gonna just thrive on money in

3611.89 --> 3620.77
trade yeah you want a secure little

3615.19 --> 3624.1
colony in every sector yeah it's

3620.77 --> 3626.609
excellent planning very bold in the age

3624.1 --> 3631.0499999999997
of vampires and all that you know

3626.609 --> 3635.34
British Empire was not exactly friendly

3631.05 --> 3637.8100000000004
to us well not always

3635.34 --> 3640.48
it went all back and forth and all that

3637.81 --> 3649.0
and yeah Spain traditional enemy was

3640.48 --> 3652.42
also going around so yeah yeah I'm I've

3649.0 --> 3654.34
always been inspired by that age just of

3652.42 --> 3656.92
what it would be like they had played

3654.34 --> 3659.26
some video game strategy games also

3656.92 --> 3667.78
about that age it's just always found it

3659.26 --> 3670.119
very intriguing no I don't have Dutch

3667.78 --> 3674.5800000000004
windmill shaped almond cookies but I'll

3670.119 --> 3674.58
bet you they exist no doubt

3680.15 --> 3683.2490000000003
[Music]

3686.55 --> 3692.0
right Missouri bear well look with the

3690.06 --> 3696.48
banking situation in the Netherlands

3692.0 --> 3699.93
back in the day we yeah we would there

3696.48 --> 3703.05
would be interest since but yeah the

3699.93 --> 3705.5699999999997
Dutch are always like oh my god he is

3703.05 --> 3707.6400000000003
robbing me because he got like a tenth

3705.57 --> 3709.88
of a percent more like the Dutch were

3707.64 --> 3714.24
always very freaky on the money

3709.88 --> 3717.84
traditionally so bankers wouldn't really

3714.24 --> 3722.0699999999997
get away with being too much of a grab

3717.84 --> 3727.26
ler like the Dutch wouldn't take that we

3722.07 --> 3729.06
were like the bank run was kind of I I

3727.26 --> 3732.84
don't know if this is historically

3729.06 --> 3734.58
accurate but I could almost feel that

3732.84 --> 3737.4
it's safe to say that the Dutch also

3734.58 --> 3740.61
invented the bank run they would be like

3737.4 --> 3743.61
what this freakin man is trying to rob

3740.61 --> 3745.05
me get her money back quickly and then

3743.61 --> 3746.76
everybody see oh [ __ ] there's a run on

3745.05 --> 3748.77
the bank run through the bank get her

3746.76 --> 3751.6200000000003
[ __ ] out divorce oh god oh god

3748.77 --> 3757.2
I think the Dutch probably invented that

3751.62 --> 3760.83
as well so yeah high-interest [ __ ] the

3757.2 --> 3763.8599999999997
Dutch would not take that I think they

3760.83 --> 3767.9
would some interest you know but not too

3763.86 --> 3767.9
much because there would be protests

3768.62 --> 3775.17
like it's it's all dine die down a

3772.05 --> 3778.59
little a little and soft enough in some

3775.17 --> 3781.8
ways and of course now that New Age the

3778.59 --> 3783.63
new alternative right whatever the

3781.8 --> 3786.1800000000003
hell's going on in the knows I can't

3783.63 --> 3793.82
keep track of the [ __ ] anymore but in

3786.18 --> 3796.9199999999996
the old days like government trying to

3793.82 --> 3798.84
heighten a certain type of taxes would

3796.92 --> 3802.67
be good enough reason to go how to

3798.84 --> 3802.67
protest very seriously

3803.29 --> 3812.17
nowadays it's like yeah there's probably

3810.49 --> 3815.6499999999996
still people out there that can keep

3812.17 --> 3827.79
very good track of how it works I can't

3815.65 --> 3831.19
oh right yeah the show is already yeah

3827.79 --> 3832.9
after round not the show and our time is

3831.19 --> 3836.23
flown anyway yeah I thought it was a

3832.9 --> 3838.42
great show almost no pauses at all had a
