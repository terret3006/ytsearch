212.0 --> 214.879
starting late

216.72 --> 220.799

224.799 --> 228.64000000000001
you have a bit of a late night so

229.2 --> 231.76
still

230.08 --> 235.59900000000002
decently rested

231.76 --> 235.599
hello elise g good to see you

238.239 --> 241.84
right so how have you been

243.599 --> 248.0
i was very active yesterday overall

248.64 --> 252.79899999999998
see even a bit hyper active in the

251.04 --> 254.79899999999998
evening

252.799 --> 257.12
but yeah flat earth debates i was very

254.799 --> 259.28000000000003
active the first half of it

257.12 --> 261.759
because i did go out for groceries after

259.28 --> 263.919
that and

261.759 --> 266.40000000000003
but yeah the first half hour i went full

263.919 --> 266.4
ball win

266.56 --> 270.08
mitchell from australia was there on the

268.32 --> 271.199
panel which was

270.08 --> 274.08
cool

271.199 --> 274.08
seen him in a while

280.72 --> 283.72
right

283.84 --> 288.79999999999995
yeah though afterward after the

286.639 --> 292.72
after show had ended and all

288.8 --> 292.72
it's a bunch of bickering going on

293.759 --> 300.0
so i kind of like jumped out of that

297.44 --> 301.759
it happened sometimes most of the time i

300.0 --> 304.88
do have the patience to kind of deal

301.759 --> 304.88
with it this time i didn't

304.96 --> 307.28
uh

307.36 --> 313.16
yeah the restlessness probably reflected

310.16 --> 313.16
later

325.759 --> 329.52000000000004
all right

326.72 --> 332.24
but yeah i've been watching a bunch of

329.52 --> 332.24
streams

336.8 --> 339.759
over a d life

340.88 --> 343.44
watch

341.759 --> 346.24
vox day

343.44 --> 346.24
lift the veil

346.96 --> 351.12
yeah also own benjamin everybody's

349.199 --> 355.6
talking about oh

351.12 --> 357.919
the oscars what who gives a [ __ ]

355.6 --> 357.91900000000004
oh

358.0 --> 364.759
will smith slap the comedian

361.759 --> 364.759
uh

367.759 --> 372.72
it's like even alex jones was talking

369.759 --> 376.6
about it like oh my god like everybody's

372.72 --> 376.6
talking about it oh

382.0 --> 385.199
actor's gonna act

385.759 --> 389.84000000000003
right

388.08 --> 392.0
well it was an act

389.84 --> 394.56
but i don't know if it was like

392.0 --> 397.919
pre-planned ahead of time it might be

394.56 --> 400.72
like a personal stunt

397.919 --> 404.31899999999996
will smith decided to do

400.72 --> 404.319
kind of a virtual signal

404.479 --> 409.68
but i don't know if they planned it

406.08 --> 411.35999999999996
ahead maybe will smith said like

409.68 --> 413.36
like let's do

411.36 --> 415.91900000000004
have an interaction or maybe he did

413.36 --> 416.96000000000004
actually just warn him ahead of time

415.919 --> 419.35999999999996
like hey

416.96 --> 421.75899999999996
stop making fun of my wife don't joke

419.36 --> 423.91900000000004
about my wife like that and then he did

421.759 --> 428.24
it anyway right

423.919 --> 430.479
so was it like a serious blow no

428.24 --> 432.479
you didn't even hear a slap you just

430.479 --> 434.56
heard a stomp because he stomped like a

432.479 --> 436.56
wrestler when he did it

434.56 --> 438.56
does that mean it was planned ahead of

436.56 --> 441.84
time

438.56 --> 441.84
not too sure about that

443.84 --> 449.039
but i think that

446.16 --> 451.52000000000004
as he did it everybody kind of just went

449.039 --> 453.759
along with it and and thought like oh

451.52 --> 456.639
this is gonna hype things up

453.759 --> 459.199
so they just like oh yeah

456.639 --> 459.199
let it be

459.68 --> 464.879
god now i'm giving my opinion about it

463.36 --> 468.639
nobody cares

464.879 --> 468.639
really not really you know

473.28 --> 478.599
they'll do anything creative buzz yeah

475.039 --> 478.599
that's what i think

480.4 --> 485.28
but it's just so

482.08 --> 488.31899999999996
like every freaking thing i tuned into

485.28 --> 488.31899999999996
was talking about it

488.479 --> 492.479
and now i'm talking about i didn't even

490.479 --> 496.4
i specifically didn't want to talk about

492.479 --> 496.4
it but just mentioning it just

499.759 --> 505.8
so it does seem to be like a little

501.84 --> 505.79999999999995
magic trick for sure

510.72 --> 514.399
man this black shirt's really getting

512.959 --> 516.959
some holes in it

514.399 --> 516.959
i need to

517.519 --> 523.68
need to get another one

521.44 --> 523.6800000000001
uh

525.76 --> 532.399
oh hello by the way

528.64 --> 535.8389999999999
not too wallace did i shout you out yet

532.399 --> 535.839
not sure anyway

539.76 --> 542.88
oh george sanford

543.279 --> 549.8
the reich lawsuits what's that

546.399 --> 549.8
george sanford

586.399 --> 591.839
oh okay

588.48 --> 594.5600000000001
right yeah i i read something about

591.839 --> 598.48
trump supposedly

594.56 --> 598.4799999999999
doing a lawsuit is is that it

601.839 --> 605.24
hello flattersage

608.72 --> 612.8000000000001
just okay

610.72 --> 615.8000000000001
matthew hall

612.8 --> 615.8
sure

651.519 --> 657.279
whoa okay george sanford

654.64 --> 661.0
that's messed up

657.279 --> 661.0
hey mike's a dunich

678.72 --> 685.48
yeah yeah i was going to ask that too

680.88 --> 685.48
jeff gassett got a link

691.12 --> 695.48
okay who's that george sanford

702.32 --> 706.9590000000001
oh okay lsg

704.48 --> 710.0
yes something might be changing

706.959 --> 712.3199999999999
i also heard even like on the owen

710.0 --> 714.639
benjamin that apparently there's some

712.32 --> 715.6
green lighting going on again

714.639 --> 717.6
so

715.6 --> 719.839
it's like they might have

717.6 --> 723.279
decided to temporarily

719.839 --> 725.12
open the pen a bit right but i can

723.279 --> 727.519
assure you

725.12 --> 729.92
that that will be retracted again at the

727.519 --> 732.639
moment of their convenience i can

729.92 --> 736.079
guarantee it to you

732.639 --> 736.88
so yeah but oh they opened the pen a bit

736.079 --> 739.04
can

736.88 --> 739.04
just

740.399 --> 744.959
can get out of the cage for a moment and

742.399 --> 747.76
stretch your legs on youtube apparently

744.959 --> 749.5999999999999
right now but i guarantee you it's only

747.76 --> 752.8
temporary

749.6 --> 755.2
right it must it can even be

752.8 --> 756.56
something that will precede an even

755.2 --> 760.0
tighter

756.56 --> 763.279
prison after that huh

760.0 --> 766.399
so yeah i'm not getting up my hopes

763.279 --> 766.399
too much just yet

769.2 --> 775.44
are you still in 80 12.

771.6 --> 775.44
am i doing today it could be better

777.04 --> 781.1999999999999
actually

778.8 --> 783.92
i don't know it's just something kind of

781.2 --> 788.0
weird that happened yesterday

783.92 --> 790.959
i was in fox days chat over at d live

788.0 --> 793.2
and i was i was like really hyper active

790.959 --> 795.68
i couldn't i literally couldn't stop

793.2 --> 795.6800000000001
talking

796.8 --> 801.92
and i felt like something was off

798.56 --> 804.7199999999999
frequency wise because of that

801.92 --> 806.639
but i really did my best to just stay

804.72 --> 809.519
creative

806.639 --> 811.92
and analytical

809.519 --> 814.5600000000001
and even fox was talking about that sort

811.92 --> 816.24
of thing so i was basically just trying

814.56 --> 819.04
to be a delta but it was very

816.24 --> 819.04
hyperactive

819.519 --> 823.92
and then he called me a gamma said that

821.76 --> 825.92
it was being meta

823.92 --> 828.92
when he obviously misread what i was

825.92 --> 828.92
saying

830.959 --> 836.399
yeah

832.88 --> 836.399
i was kind of shocked by that

836.48 --> 840.279
and i feel humiliated

843.36 --> 845.76
because

846.16 --> 848.48
yeah

849.44 --> 854.0
i do kind of respect

851.76 --> 856.24
his insight i mean he literally wrote

854.0 --> 857.6
the book about the social sexual

856.24 --> 859.279
hierarchy

857.6 --> 861.1990000000001
so

859.279 --> 864.88
like i don't think he's a guy that just

861.199 --> 864.88
says such things lightly

868.88 --> 873.16
so yeah

889.12 --> 892.12
um

899.04 --> 901.36
okay

904.48 --> 908.0790000000001
from a red dwarf all right

908.24 --> 913.199
i'll check it out later

910.16 --> 916.7199999999999
thanks for the link

913.199 --> 919.4399999999999
did i have a fall out with him no

916.72 --> 921.44
no because that would then immediately

919.44 --> 924.0790000000001
confirm that i'm a gamma

921.44 --> 924.0790000000001
and i'm not

924.959 --> 930.7199999999999
although in my mind i'm often plagued by

929.519 --> 933.12
basically

930.72 --> 935.12
reverse projecting everything that is

933.12 --> 938.12
terrible out there in the world onto

935.12 --> 938.12
myself

940.959 --> 945.199
so yeah

942.8 --> 947.519
if somebody like fox calls me a gamma

945.199 --> 950.399
that really hurts

947.519 --> 950.399
i'm an empath

953.12 --> 957.759
and he's like just a stoic guy and

956.639 --> 959.839
whatever

957.759 --> 962.8000000000001
you know

959.839 --> 966.0
and i am anything but stoic i'm

962.8 --> 967.4399999999999
extremely expressive

966.0 --> 971.36
and yeah

967.44 --> 973.759
i can rage i i do have like gamma

971.36 --> 976.88
functions as well

973.759 --> 979.36
integrated within my overall expression

976.88 --> 979.36
system

979.44 --> 984.48
but i don't spiral like gammas

985.36 --> 992.88
right because every time i have i've

988.079 --> 992.88
always been like monstrously humiliated

993.199 --> 996.199
and

996.24 --> 999.44
yeah

997.199 --> 1000.7199999999999
to then be

999.44 --> 1003.1990000000001
just

1000.72 --> 1003.1990000000001
i don't know

1003.759 --> 1008.88
i don't i it's i think it's probably

1006.639 --> 1010.8
just similar to the time when i was

1008.88 --> 1011.759
hanging around in owen benjamin's live

1010.8 --> 1015.12
chat

1011.759 --> 1017.44
i get on people's nerves i'm hyperactive

1015.12 --> 1019.199
and to be fair i'm kind of [ __ ]

1017.44 --> 1022.32
brilliant

1019.199 --> 1025.039
oh look at arwen so full of himself yeah

1022.32 --> 1025.919
yeah it's just freaking true

1025.039 --> 1028.319
and

1025.919 --> 1029.959
i challenge anyone to get into the

1028.319 --> 1032.6399999999999
technicals of what i'm saying

1029.959 --> 1034.799
spontaneously in the moment and actually

1032.64 --> 1037.439
then prove me wrong

1034.799 --> 1040.48
and if they're right and i am wrong i

1037.439 --> 1043.6000000000001
will immediately admit it i will

1040.48 --> 1046.079
actually understand the correction like

1043.6 --> 1048.1599999999999
even the conversation was that about

1046.079 --> 1049.84
being corrected and about judgment and

1048.16 --> 1052.64
passing judgment and if you pass

1049.84 --> 1054.32
judgment you're expecting to you should

1052.64 --> 1057.1200000000001
be expecting judgment it's not about

1054.32 --> 1059.52
don't judge others ever

1057.12 --> 1062.8799999999999
right that was even the conversation and

1059.52 --> 1064.799
i inserted my position

1062.88 --> 1068.0800000000002
and then he said i was being meta and

1064.799 --> 1071.28
that it should stop the gammaing

1068.08 --> 1071.28
and that hurt

1075.919 --> 1079.5200000000002
right

1077.28 --> 1083.039
because then i'm thinking

1079.52 --> 1085.679
it kind of i guess kind of basic

1083.039 --> 1088.799
like oh yeah yeah vox oh such an

1085.679 --> 1088.799
accomplished guy and

1089.679 --> 1095.2800000000002
and i'm not really i'm just a blabberer

1092.16 --> 1098.24
on youtube and i e-back

1095.28 --> 1100.24
and who fair i got some skills yeah but

1098.24 --> 1102.559
i got nothing really

1100.24 --> 1104.48
and i got nothing but a couple of skills

1102.559 --> 1107.28
i haven't really applaud them for

1104.48 --> 1109.039
financial success

1107.28 --> 1113.76
really other than

1109.039 --> 1115.919
just some basic level of respect

1113.76 --> 1115.919
so

1118.08 --> 1122.559
yeah

1119.6 --> 1125.6
just thinking about well could i fix

1122.559 --> 1128.8799999999999
that could i actually just write a book

1125.6 --> 1131.28
how i am i gonna feel myself doing that

1128.88 --> 1134.3200000000002
well in the past being humiliated has

1131.28 --> 1135.6789999999999
actually pushed me like beyond my own

1134.32 --> 1138.48
boundaries and

1135.679 --> 1139.76
very far out of my comfort zone

1138.48 --> 1141.84
to do

1139.76 --> 1144.24
things and manifest things that i

1141.84 --> 1145.12
normally wouldn't do so

1144.24 --> 1148.48
yeah

1145.12 --> 1151.1999999999998
i freaking hate feeling humiliated

1148.48 --> 1153.6
but if i'm gonna feel humiliated i might

1151.2 --> 1156.96
just as well try to weaponize it and

1153.6 --> 1159.12
actually help me change things

1156.96 --> 1163.3600000000001
change the cause right that's what it's

1159.12 --> 1163.36
supposed to be there for originally

1163.6 --> 1167.28
that's right

1165.12 --> 1170.0
there are no

1167.28 --> 1172.72
no feelings that don't have a direct

1170.0 --> 1175.72
design purpose in my philosophical

1172.72 --> 1175.72
opinion

1178.32 --> 1183.039
so yeah back back to the drawing board

1184.799 --> 1189.6
am i gonna write a book how am i gonna

1187.039 --> 1193.48
write a book what about can i write a

1189.6 --> 1193.48
book about just cosmogeny

1193.52 --> 1199.44
or maybe i should write a book about

1196.64 --> 1199.44
psychology

1200.32 --> 1205.6789999999999
like from a complete layman's armenian

1203.28 --> 1206.799
perspective

1205.679 --> 1208.159
and just

1206.799 --> 1209.76
i guess

1208.159 --> 1212.159
in a way also

1209.76 --> 1214.8799999999999
follow fox's advice because i have been

1212.159 --> 1218.64
listening to him he does have really

1214.88 --> 1218.64
refined practical advice

1219.6 --> 1226.0
also about just like making mistakes

1223.52 --> 1230.0
just doing something even if you know

1226.0 --> 1230.0
it's not going to be what you want

1230.32 --> 1234.6399999999999
if you really have oversight and i do

1232.72 --> 1235.919
have that right it's always been my

1234.64 --> 1237.3600000000001
problem

1235.919 --> 1240.24
i've

1237.36 --> 1243.9189999999999
passed the opportunity to do a whole

1240.24 --> 1245.36
bunch of things in my life a whole lot

1243.919 --> 1248.0
why

1245.36 --> 1250.1589999999999
because i knew that if i'd engage with

1248.0 --> 1253.36
it i wouldn't technically get out of it

1250.159 --> 1255.1200000000001
what i really wanted to

1253.36 --> 1257.6
here's the thing though

1255.12 --> 1260.7199999999998
in retrospect that was the worst

1257.6 --> 1263.28
systematic decision making

1260.72 --> 1267.28
that i've ever subjected myself to

1263.28 --> 1268.799
because it's not about accomplishing

1267.28 --> 1272.3999999999999
really

1268.799 --> 1273.76
what you set out to do at first

1272.4 --> 1276.5590000000002
right

1273.76 --> 1279.679
it's about trying things

1276.559 --> 1281.44
and failing and being humiliated and

1279.679 --> 1282.64
then correcting

1281.44 --> 1286.0
and then

1282.64 --> 1286.0
after the humiliation

1286.64 --> 1290.7990000000002
opening up to a new world

1289.12 --> 1293.36
where you can get

1290.799 --> 1296.24
closer towards a point where you can

1293.36 --> 1298.3999999999999
actually exactly accomplish

1296.24 --> 1300.64
what you set out to do

1298.4 --> 1302.799
right you can only really accomplish

1300.64 --> 1305.44
what you set out to do if you've tried

1302.799 --> 1307.6
it several times before that and there

1305.44 --> 1309.52
is nothing

1307.6 --> 1311.12
you can do

1309.52 --> 1316.0
to prevent

1311.12 --> 1318.8799999999999
it from working the way it does

1316.0 --> 1320.96
and it's a lost lesson that fox is like

1318.88 --> 1323.3600000000001
really

1320.96 --> 1325.2
specialized in for himself and i i

1323.36 --> 1328.4799999999998
really respect that

1325.2 --> 1330.96
and i feel humiliated that i have not

1328.48 --> 1330.96
done that

1331.2 --> 1335.8400000000001
i mean i have in some areas

1336.32 --> 1339.28
but i've

1337.36 --> 1341.1999999999998
not done it

1339.28 --> 1344.08
more times than

1341.2 --> 1347.24
than i wish i have

1344.08 --> 1347.24
all right

1347.36 --> 1352.4799999999998
so yeah hopefully by laying it out i can

1351.28 --> 1356.36
put

1352.48 --> 1356.3600000000001
some of that to rest

1361.36 --> 1366.08
but maybe i'm just gonna

1364.72 --> 1370.039
pass

1366.08 --> 1370.039
visiting fox day

1375.2 --> 1379.28
mostly talks about things that i have no

1377.36 --> 1381.52
idea of anyway

1379.28 --> 1384.96
but i do kind of like that because i can

1381.52 --> 1386.559
use my magic skills

1384.96 --> 1389.52
to literally

1386.559 --> 1392.24
learn structures about things that i've

1389.52 --> 1396.4
never even like gotten close to

1392.24 --> 1396.4
and i have learned a lot that way

1397.52 --> 1401.039
right

1398.48 --> 1403.44
it's cheating it's cheating with

1401.039 --> 1407.0
information i know how to do it and i

1403.44 --> 1407.0
can do it

1416.48 --> 1420.24
but it does

1417.76 --> 1424.0
in a way rob people the wrong way

1420.24 --> 1424.0
especially those that are really

1424.32 --> 1429.279
filled

1426.48 --> 1432.08
with pride over their actual physical

1429.279 --> 1432.08
accomplishments

1441.84 --> 1445.799
what are you talking about kevlar

1451.679 --> 1454.679
what

1458.72 --> 1463.919
so scared then they can't test on live

1461.52 --> 1463.9189999999999
shows

1465.039 --> 1469.12
what

1466.32 --> 1470.32
but jeff you gotta you you can just post

1469.12 --> 1473.799
links here

1470.32 --> 1473.799
you got a wrench

1479.039 --> 1481.919
ah

1480.159 --> 1485.4
thank you man on the edge i really

1481.919 --> 1485.4
appreciate that

1486.24 --> 1490.08
i do kind of love to hear about that

1494.88 --> 1499.679
i mean i have

1496.96 --> 1501.52
not a lot of feel for how many people

1499.679 --> 1504.24
actually listen to me and have learned

1501.52 --> 1506.08
to appreciate what i do

1504.24 --> 1509.24
except for the guys that come over here

1506.08 --> 1509.24
in chat

1544.0 --> 1547.88
wait what's going on here

1562.24 --> 1565.24
so

1582.84 --> 1586.8799999999999
wait

1584.72 --> 1588.4
yeah i'm

1586.88 --> 1591.5200000000002
this

1588.4 --> 1595.1200000000001
was even talking about

1591.52 --> 1598.36
uh yeah well i'm cleared up

1595.12 --> 1598.36
that helped

1611.44 --> 1615.44
right also i realized that

1613.76 --> 1618.0
i kind of want

1615.44 --> 1619.2
fox's book about the social sexual

1618.0 --> 1621.919
hierarchy

1619.2 --> 1623.8400000000001
because i really don't understand it

1621.919 --> 1626.5590000000002
that's what i figured out

1623.84 --> 1628.6399999999999
i mean if stephen fox now really talk

1626.559 --> 1631.52
about intricacies

1628.64 --> 1633.44
and i realize i know very little about

1631.52 --> 1637.12
this system

1633.44 --> 1640.3990000000001
i mean i apply some of it

1637.12 --> 1642.8799999999999
but like 75 percent probably a rough

1640.399 --> 1645.12
estimation of what it's really about and

1642.88 --> 1648.48
the details is com

1645.12 --> 1648.4799999999998
completely eludes me

1649.039 --> 1653.679
and it's annoying because

1651.679 --> 1656.5590000000002
just doing what i do i'm not going to be

1653.679 --> 1658.799
able to really get it so i i

1656.559 --> 1660.72
need vox's book

1658.799 --> 1663.44
to read it

1660.72 --> 1666.44
in order to to truly understand its

1663.44 --> 1666.44
roots

1668.32 --> 1672.48
yeah

1670.24 --> 1674.88
maybe at some point i'll i'll try to get

1672.48 --> 1674.88
his book

1675.279 --> 1682.0
so that i i i won't

1678.32 --> 1685.48
in his eyes humiliate myself anymore

1682.0 --> 1685.48
with my improvisations

1696.559 --> 1702.399
whoa jeffy i said that's scary

1700.48 --> 1705.96
right dude you did tell us about that

1702.399 --> 1705.9599999999998
yesterday right

1717.52 --> 1720.52
huh

1747.84 --> 1751.559
yeah i know jeff

1758.88 --> 1763.0390000000002
right so yeah

1760.559 --> 1765.76
i'm open for questions again

1763.039 --> 1768.399
mechanics

1765.76 --> 1770.399
references to things i've said so far

1768.399 --> 1772.1589999999999
which could literally be anything right

1770.399 --> 1774.6399999999999
if you want to bring up something i was

1772.159 --> 1777.3600000000001
talking about a month ago or half a year

1774.64 --> 1779.3600000000001
ago that i for some reason haven't

1777.36 --> 1780.399
mentioned since but it's been on your

1779.36 --> 1783.1999999999998
mind

1780.399 --> 1786.32
don't be shy to just bring it up again

1783.2 --> 1788.96
i really do like to be reminded about

1786.32 --> 1790.399
things that i have said and all that in

1788.96 --> 1793.279
the past

1790.399 --> 1794.8799999999999
because i've said so many freaking

1793.279 --> 1796.96
things

1794.88 --> 1800.0
during my life i don't really

1796.96 --> 1802.48
consciously remember most of it

1800.0 --> 1804.799
i mean it's there the structure is there

1802.48 --> 1806.48
because that's how i even manifest my

1804.799 --> 1811.039
ideas

1806.48 --> 1813.76
right my ideas are not separate ideas

1811.039 --> 1817.679
they're basically a

1813.76 --> 1820.64
left out of a giant

1817.679 --> 1822.799
life-size collected mesh

1820.64 --> 1825.679
of structure

1822.799 --> 1825.679
the pattern

1826.159 --> 1829.5200000000002
my pattern

1828.24 --> 1832.0
so

1829.52 --> 1834.24
i don't need to consciously remember

1832.0 --> 1838.48
anything because i know that in the

1834.24 --> 1840.32
future if i look back it's going to fit

1838.48 --> 1842.799
and even more

1840.32 --> 1844.399
it's going to show me my own learning

1842.799 --> 1846.72
curve

1844.399 --> 1847.52
because it will fit

1846.72 --> 1848.72
but

1847.52 --> 1851.2
how

1848.72 --> 1853.679
precisely will it fit

1851.2 --> 1856.64
into my future

1853.679 --> 1856.64
grown position

1856.88 --> 1860.96
so always like to be reminded about

1858.88 --> 1864.64
things i've said in the past

1860.96 --> 1867.519
it's even why i can appreciate snarky

1864.64 --> 1870.96
trolls trying to humiliate me

1867.519 --> 1872.88
because they base that on things they've

1870.96 --> 1874.96
experienced from me in the past which

1872.88 --> 1877.0390000000002
were real

1874.96 --> 1878.88
and then

1877.039 --> 1881.039
it's the same thing

1878.88 --> 1884.159
whether you remind me about something

1881.039 --> 1887.36
humiliating i did in the past or whether

1884.159 --> 1889.44
it was a great idea or concept that

1887.36 --> 1893.84
fascinated you

1889.44 --> 1893.8400000000001
it's effectively the same to me

1897.6 --> 1901.9189999999999
although yeah

1899.84 --> 1906.519
being reminded about good ideas tends to

1901.919 --> 1906.519
be a lot more exciting

1909.76 --> 1913.84
never heard of a channel called free

1911.36 --> 1915.84
your mind

1913.84 --> 1917.1999999999998
well with a name like that it could

1915.84 --> 1920.84
literally be

1917.2 --> 1920.8400000000001
hundreds of people

1942.799 --> 1945.799
uh

1968.159 --> 1972.3990000000001
okay

1969.36 --> 1972.399
that was unexpected

1973.279 --> 1977.279
that was my landlord asking for my email

1975.679 --> 1980.279
address

1977.279 --> 1980.279
hmm

1990.0 --> 1995.519
i hope

1991.76 --> 1995.519
he's not gonna do something

1996.24 --> 2000.88
not gonna send lawyers and [ __ ] after me

1998.559 --> 2000.8799999999999
again

2001.2 --> 2005.8400000000001
i don't know why he'd want my email

2003.12 --> 2005.84
address

2007.12 --> 2009.5189999999998
anyway

2016.48 --> 2022.24
so yeah flatter stage no i don't know

2019.2 --> 2025.1200000000001
anybody called free your mind because

2022.24 --> 2027.2
over the last few years i've seen so

2025.12 --> 2029.039
many channels that have that sort of a

2027.2 --> 2031.039
name

2029.039 --> 2033.84
i i wouldn't know which one you're

2031.039 --> 2033.84
talking about

2064.24 --> 2068.1589999999997
okay well he said thanks

2069.76 --> 2074.96
so i guess it's just for

2071.8 --> 2077.96
registration purposes or whatever

2074.96 --> 2077.96
fine

2093.119 --> 2098.44
i hope he's not gonna up my rent that

2095.04 --> 2098.44
would be disastrous

2129.52 --> 2132.8
okay

2130.4 --> 2132.8
guys

2135.52 --> 2141.48
flatter sage

2137.119 --> 2141.48
do you have a link you know

2154.0 --> 2157.0
ah

2166.24 --> 2169.24
hmm

2181.599 --> 2187.1600000000003
okay

2182.72 --> 2187.16
no i've never seen this channel before

2188.24 --> 2191.04
it's pretty big

2193.92 --> 2198.48
for flat earther

2196.16 --> 2200.56
even mentioning

2198.48 --> 2202.72
anti-flat earther so

2200.56 --> 2205.359
yeah i'll check it out

2202.72 --> 2205.359
thanks for that

2208.4 --> 2212.32
2017.

2210.19 --> 2215.839
[Music]

2212.32 --> 2215.839
okay so he's been at it for a while

2217.599 --> 2220.599
right

2239.92 --> 2245.44
right since there doesn't seem to be a

2241.68 --> 2248.0
picture slideshow in that video can you

2245.44 --> 2249.119
lay it out

2248.0 --> 2251.52
in it

2249.119 --> 2257.079
in 200 characters what it's roughly

2251.52 --> 2257.079
about storms are not what you were told

2262.079 --> 2266.5600000000004
alex dean is a trainer oh god what did

2264.079 --> 2269.2000000000003
he do now

2266.56 --> 2272.64
no i haven't seen that one yet gs after

2269.2 --> 2276.24
i'll check it out as soon as it comes by

2272.64 --> 2276.24
man he's really on a tour

2276.8 --> 2280.599
that alex dean

2296.4 --> 2301.92
right it does sound funny

2299.599 --> 2301.92
right

2302.64 --> 2307.5989999999997
50k damn yeah well dude with what he's

2305.44 --> 2310.48
been doing recently it's not a surprise

2307.599 --> 2313.839
man he's like super

2310.48 --> 2313.839
he's all the rage

2314.16 --> 2317.16
right

2329.44 --> 2334.48
yeah i could think of another gig that

2331.76 --> 2338.1600000000003
he could also do right

2334.48 --> 2341.16
he could just rename himself alex

2338.16 --> 2341.16
stain

2341.76 --> 2347.0400000000004
and be like no i've always been called

2344.32 --> 2347.04
alex sting

2347.76 --> 2353.6800000000003
what you thought i was called alex stein

2351.52 --> 2357.52
no no that must be the mandela effect

2353.68 --> 2357.52
i'm actually called alex stein

2357.599 --> 2361.119
if he wanted to do that

2365.76 --> 2368.76
huh

2404.8 --> 2409.52
hmm

2406.64 --> 2412.96
wait alex steen is talking about flat

2409.52 --> 2415.28
earth too during that those skits really

2412.96 --> 2415.28
huh

2420.88 --> 2426.76
oh man it's getting kind of cold here

2422.88 --> 2426.76
i'm going to put on my sweater

2450.88 --> 2455.119
okay my hair is still good

2461.68 --> 2466.7599999999998
not on the council meetings right that's

2463.44 --> 2466.76
what i meant

2505.359 --> 2509.16
right so anyway

2510.88 --> 2517.04
still got another 45 minutes to go

2513.599 --> 2517.04
roughly so yeah

2517.44 --> 2521.64
what can i talk about

2557.28 --> 2560.28
so

2593.04 --> 2595.359
what

2597.28 --> 2602.6400000000003
what causes storm is due to human

2599.839 --> 2606.839
interaction what

2602.64 --> 2606.839
that sounds highly fantastical

2613.28 --> 2618.8390000000004
that sounds really weird to me i mean

2615.52 --> 2620.88
i've experienced pretty much exactly the

2618.839 --> 2623.599
opposite like

2620.88 --> 2626.839
the weather influences me not the other

2623.599 --> 2626.839
way around

2634.0 --> 2638.0
okay

2635.28 --> 2639.6800000000003
well i'll i'll check it out flatter sage

2638.0 --> 2643.839
it

2639.68 --> 2643.839
it's not that long a video anyway

2644.88 --> 2648.6800000000003
11 and a half minutes

2651.359 --> 2654.56
a goalie mckernan

2666.24 --> 2670.3999999999996
seems to be clearing up already a bit

2668.88 --> 2672.7200000000003
that's nice

2670.4 --> 2675.7200000000003
[Music]

2672.72 --> 2675.72
see

2696.56 --> 2700.96
collective conscious

2698.72 --> 2703.9599999999996
shifts reality

2700.96 --> 2703.96
really

2706.72 --> 2711.7999999999997
how

2707.839 --> 2711.7999999999997
how does it do that george

2724.8 --> 2730.48
i mean i know it's a very popular

2728.56 --> 2732.88
little urban myth

2730.48 --> 2734.4
based on the complete misunderstanding

2732.88 --> 2736.1600000000003
of

2734.4 --> 2740.64
things

2736.16 --> 2744.24
relating to quantum mechanics yeah

2740.64 --> 2747.1189999999997
i know it's a very popular urban myth i

2744.24 --> 2749.1189999999997
think it's complete [ __ ] but love to

2747.119 --> 2752.0
hear your inside

2749.119 --> 2752.0
opinion on it

2752.16 --> 2757.72
your intentions come back on the loop

2762.8 --> 2765.28
okay

2764.4 --> 2767.6800000000003
so

2765.28 --> 2770.96
what type of reality are you talking

2767.68 --> 2770.96
about that shifts then

2772.8 --> 2777.92
could that have something to do with

2774.72 --> 2781.359
your social reality

2777.92 --> 2784.88
that people will reflect to you

2781.359 --> 2787.5989999999997
what they get basically from you

2784.88 --> 2789.92
people adapt to the energy level of the

2787.599 --> 2792.2400000000002
person that they're interacting with

2789.92 --> 2795.2000000000003
then i'd say yeah

2792.24 --> 2797.359
that reality definitely shifts i've

2795.2 --> 2800.0
experienced it all the time

2797.359 --> 2800.72
if i feel shitty people are gonna kind

2800.0 --> 2803.2
of

2800.72 --> 2805.52
they just try to avoid me and i take

2803.2 --> 2807.68
more notice because i do feel shitty if

2805.52 --> 2811.839
i feel great people are like oh i want

2807.68 --> 2812.72
to get closer to that especially ladies

2811.839 --> 2815.119
and

2812.72 --> 2816.48
yeah i know it is that and i'm like oh

2815.119 --> 2819.119
yeah right

2816.48 --> 2821.599
so that reality shifts is that an

2819.119 --> 2823.119
objective reality though

2821.599 --> 2825.76
you know

2823.119 --> 2825.76
you knew

2828.8 --> 2832.5600000000004
so i'd say no

2832.64 --> 2837.44
collective consciousness does not shift

2834.8 --> 2837.44
reality

2838.56 --> 2845.2799999999997
but the social reality that you find

2842.16 --> 2850.5989999999997
yourself in can be shifted thanks to

2845.28 --> 2850.599
your intentions and of those around you

2858.559 --> 2865.119
right well that's exactly where i draw

2861.76 --> 2868.2400000000002
the line george sanford and say that's

2865.119 --> 2868.2400000000002
kind of [ __ ]

2868.4 --> 2875.04
you have absolutely not even a hint or a

2872.0 --> 2877.28
trace of evidence that that's

2875.04 --> 2880.16
actually the case

2877.28 --> 2883.28
cows are not going to be purple

2880.16 --> 2885.2
and just because everybody for some

2883.28 --> 2887.599
baffling reason

2885.2 --> 2889.9199999999996
starts to believe that they are won't

2887.599 --> 2892.96
make them purple

2889.92 --> 2896.079
you can create a projection in your mind

2892.96 --> 2897.92
that makes you see them purple perhaps

2896.079 --> 2900.7200000000003
that's not going to make them purple

2897.92 --> 2903.76
because that physical reality doesn't

2900.72 --> 2907.839
change it's only the perception of

2903.76 --> 2907.8390000000004
reality that seems quite flexible

2910.64 --> 2912.319
so

2911.52 --> 2916.64
no

2912.319 --> 2916.64
no george sanford you're wrong

2926.8 --> 2931.52
i wish i could just write this sort of

2928.96 --> 2933.44
[ __ ] down in my book

2931.52 --> 2936.079
because these are the kind of insights

2933.44 --> 2938.559
that are worthy sharing it's just i

2936.079 --> 2940.48
don't know how to even remember this

2938.559 --> 2942.48
sort of detail

2940.48 --> 2946.4
when i'm writing and i'm all stuck in my

2942.48 --> 2946.4
own head it doesn't work like that

2952.079 --> 2957.8390000000004
the mind creates

2954.839 --> 2960.7999999999997
reality no

2957.839 --> 2963.599
well let me just say like this define

2960.8 --> 2963.599
reality

2964.0 --> 2966.319
right

2966.4 --> 2972.4
are we talking physical reality or are

2968.96 --> 2974.64
we talking personal reality

2972.4 --> 2974.64
right

2977.119 --> 2982.8
and a mandela effect is an example of

2979.68 --> 2985.52
changes yeah except it isn't

2982.8 --> 2988.48
because the mandela effect is

2985.52 --> 2989.52
i can say now by now

2988.48 --> 2992.88
that i'm

2989.52 --> 2995.119
very certain it is a hundred percent

2992.88 --> 2997.44
psychological

2995.119 --> 2999.359
it's basically misremembering yeah

2997.44 --> 3001.76
nobody remembers

2999.359 --> 3005.2799999999997
a mandela effect

3001.76 --> 3008.0
of something where it's like wait the

3005.28 --> 3012.0
name of this is wrong

3008.0 --> 3014.24
because it should be the stupid name

3012.0 --> 3017.04
right it's off i mean the way you're

3014.24 --> 3020.24
saying it is oh that sounds yeah that's

3017.04 --> 3022.64
how it should be but the real thing you

3020.24 --> 3027.839
actually said it wrong and it was part

3022.64 --> 3027.839
of its thing to say it wrong

3029.119 --> 3038.1600000000003
nobody remembers anything like that

3032.96 --> 3040.88
you only remember it the right way

3038.16 --> 3043.5989999999997
that everybody will agree upon like that

3040.88 --> 3048.319
sounds right

3043.599 --> 3051.28
when the real thing is the wrong way why

3048.319 --> 3054.319
because it was slightly tinkered with

3051.28 --> 3055.119
wrong made slightly wrong

3054.319 --> 3056.4
to

3055.119 --> 3060.48
force

3056.4 --> 3064.079
you to correct it in your mind

3060.48 --> 3066.2400000000002
it draws your soul in it's basically

3064.079 --> 3068.8
social engineering based advertising

3066.24 --> 3071.1189999999997
makes something slightly off to trigger

3068.8 --> 3073.76
you and make you engage

3071.119 --> 3076.319
yeah they've been doing that for a long

3073.76 --> 3078.3190000000004
time in media

3076.319 --> 3080.839
that's the mandela effect

3078.319 --> 3082.8
it's you

3080.839 --> 3085.68
misremembering

3082.8 --> 3087.76
what you think it should be

3085.68 --> 3090.64
because that thing you think it should

3087.76 --> 3093.3590000000004
be you probably thought exactly that the

3090.64 --> 3096.72
first time you first heard it or read it

3093.359 --> 3100.96
and thought this is wrong it should be

3096.72 --> 3103.359
this yeah well you remember it the way

3100.96 --> 3106.079
you thought it should be

3103.359 --> 3107.2
most people do and that's the mandela

3106.079 --> 3109.599
effect

3107.2 --> 3112.24
is purely psychological there are no

3109.599 --> 3115.7200000000003
physical changes that's a giant urban

3112.24 --> 3115.72
myth again

3133.52 --> 3139.64
sorry to burst your bubble if you're

3135.52 --> 3139.64
really into that but

3141.359 --> 3145.2799999999997
i'm

3142.48 --> 3146.48
very confident that

3145.28 --> 3149.6800000000003
yeah

3146.48 --> 3149.68
i can pin this

3150.48 --> 3155.68
down just like that and in 10 years

3153.28 --> 3156.96
everybody will be like oh yeah yeah you

3155.68 --> 3160.839
were right

3156.96 --> 3160.839
because i know i'm right

3168.88 --> 3172.7200000000003
it took me a while to figure it out by

3170.8 --> 3176.4
the way

3172.72 --> 3178.5589999999997
but i could say that since the last year

3176.4 --> 3180.559
i'm kind of like yeah

3178.559 --> 3184.559
it's dissolved i

3180.559 --> 3185.599
i know what it is now i'm 100 certain

3184.559 --> 3188.48
because it

3185.599 --> 3190.48
like i can apply this train of thinking

3188.48 --> 3194.72
this structure that i just provided

3190.48 --> 3196.16
about what it really is to every single

3194.72 --> 3197.839
example

3196.16 --> 3200.0
whatever you're going to bring on even

3197.839 --> 3202.64
if i've never heard of it before i could

3200.0 --> 3204.8
immediately point out to you

3202.64 --> 3207.92
how it applies how the mechanism the

3204.8 --> 3209.599
psychological mechanism of it applies to

3207.92 --> 3212.559
it whatever you're going to bring forth

3209.599 --> 3214.96
that is supposedly mandela affected

3212.559 --> 3218.8390000000004
every single example i will be able to

3214.96 --> 3218.839
successfully do that

3231.839 --> 3236.5589999999997
does anybody else remember the line e.t

3234.559 --> 3238.8
found home

3236.559 --> 3238.8
no

3239.28 --> 3243.76
but i'll bet

3240.72 --> 3247.52
thousands and thousands of people were

3243.76 --> 3250.6400000000003
saying exactly that et phone home

3247.52 --> 3254.079
because that's the way you summarize

3250.64 --> 3255.92
that sort of social effect in your head

3254.079 --> 3258.1600000000003
that's how you're going to clown around

3255.92 --> 3259.839
saying that so i'll bet that there isn't

3258.16 --> 3261.52
actually a moment where he literally

3259.839 --> 3265.119
says that

3261.52 --> 3267.04
but i might be wrong

3265.119 --> 3269.28
i'm just guessing that you brought that

3267.04 --> 3270.319
up because it's supposedly mandela

3269.28 --> 3271.76
affected

3270.319 --> 3274.5589999999997
according to you

3271.76 --> 3274.559
platter sage

3275.44 --> 3278.88
i'm just pointing out how the mechanics

3277.44 --> 3281.359
of such a thing

3278.88 --> 3281.359
would work

3282.64 --> 3288.64
people have a response to media things

3286.88 --> 3290.6400000000003
especially if they liked it they will

3288.64 --> 3292.8799999999997
summarize it in their head they will

3290.64 --> 3296.799
create micro

3292.88 --> 3299.04
assembled icons out of certain phrases

3296.799 --> 3300.64
that summarize the feel of the whole

3299.04 --> 3304.0
thing and guess what they're going to

3300.64 --> 3305.52
remember those self-created micro

3304.0 --> 3307.76
assembled

3305.52 --> 3309.119
summarizations

3307.76 --> 3311.76
that's what they're going to remember

3309.119 --> 3313.6800000000003
and then a later 10 years 20 years later

3311.76 --> 3315.76
even more you'll watch it back and

3313.68 --> 3317.44
you'll be like what i thought they said

3315.76 --> 3320.1600000000003
this

3317.44 --> 3322.799
no no they didn't you created that out

3320.16 --> 3325.52
of it and you remembered that and now

3322.799 --> 3325.52
you mistake

3325.68 --> 3331.5989999999997
what you created out of it

3328.16 --> 3334.839
for being in the movie or in the music

3331.599 --> 3334.839
or whatever

3349.119 --> 3353.52
much headphone home et home phone

3358.079 --> 3362.7200000000003
maybe

3360.319 --> 3365.68
at some point he's just like sort of

3362.72 --> 3367.1189999999997
panic rambling home phone so yeah you

3365.68 --> 3370.0
could have heard all kinds of things and

3367.119 --> 3370.0
then i don't know man

3370.24 --> 3375.4799999999996
dude it's been forever since i watched

3372.24 --> 3375.4799999999996
that movie

3379.04 --> 3382.04
uh

3404.0 --> 3406.88
remember et phone home

3406.0 --> 3409.92
well

3406.88 --> 3412.96
geoshifter i don't know if et ever says

3409.92 --> 3413.839
that i would have to watch it

3412.96 --> 3415.839
again

3413.839 --> 3419.119
and it's probably gonna be boring as

3415.839 --> 3422.72
[ __ ] to me but

3419.119 --> 3424.079
maybe that's what the kid said elliot or

3422.72 --> 3426.3999999999996
something

3424.079 --> 3426.4
says

3427.359 --> 3430.0789999999997
not e.t

3431.28 --> 3436.48
like he said edie phone home oh he wants

3434.559 --> 3439.52
the phone home right but does that mean

3436.48 --> 3441.68
that he eti himself said that exactly

3439.52 --> 3444.079
like that or was he kind of just one

3441.68 --> 3447.9199999999996
word other word and then elliot

3444.079 --> 3451.44
concludes oh he means et phoned right

3447.92 --> 3451.44
this is all psychological

3453.28 --> 3458.119
besides i really don't want to watch et

3464.72 --> 3471.72
i mean it sounds about as fun as as

3467.119 --> 3471.7200000000003
playing the atari video game

3480.799 --> 3483.52
okay

3481.76 --> 3485.6800000000003
that's right

3483.52 --> 3489.839
that's right logical conclusion that's

3485.68 --> 3489.839
my logical conclusion as well

3519.52 --> 3524.72
does light have a speed or is it

3521.839 --> 3524.72
instantaneous

3529.119 --> 3534.079
i kind of thought it has a speed

3531.839 --> 3534.0789999999997
but

3536.319 --> 3540.079
i can't say for sure

3540.24 --> 3545.2799999999997
effectively to myself and how i reason

3543.44 --> 3546.7200000000003
things out physical matter and

3545.28 --> 3548.7200000000003
everything

3546.72 --> 3551.04
how the realm works

3548.72 --> 3552.9599999999996
it it's fine either well it doesn't

3551.04 --> 3556.2
really matter whether it has a speed or

3552.96 --> 3556.2
is instantaneous

3560.799 --> 3566.64
like even theoretically it's just so

3563.839 --> 3566.64
fast that

3568.079 --> 3574.6400000000003
it becomes unattainable to really

3571.28 --> 3574.6400000000003
differentiate anyway

3578.319 --> 3582.4
right

3579.76 --> 3585.2400000000002
how much of a distance

3582.4 --> 3587.839
will you have to bridge for light to

3585.24 --> 3589.4399999999996
pre-supposedly travel before you can

3587.839 --> 3593.2799999999997
even

3589.44 --> 3593.28
catch a time differential

3594.16 --> 3599.0
you know

3596.0 --> 3599.0
like

3604.48 --> 3607.92
rate of propagation

3609.119 --> 3615.839
what

3610.799 --> 3615.839
is that not just another word for speed

3648.64 --> 3652.16
depends on the medium

3652.48 --> 3654.96
well

3653.76 --> 3658.079
light

3654.96 --> 3661.52
whether it is instantaneous

3658.079 --> 3661.52
is considered to travel

3662.559 --> 3667.3590000000004
right

3664.319 --> 3672.64
through the medium indeed now does

3667.359 --> 3675.359
the medium actually slow down the light

3672.64 --> 3677.839
does it actually do that or does it just

3675.359 --> 3677.839
kind of

3678.4 --> 3681.28
refract it

3683.52 --> 3688.4
make like the way it functions

3686.079 --> 3691.92
differently

3688.4 --> 3694.559
does it literally slow it down

3691.92 --> 3697.28
like can you slow light down by for

3694.559 --> 3699.3590000000004
example making it through move through a

3697.28 --> 3702.2400000000002
medium of water

3699.359 --> 3704.0
or is the receive time basically going

3702.24 --> 3707.04
to be

3704.0 --> 3707.04
exactly the same

3710.64 --> 3716.64
like has that even actually been tested

3713.2 --> 3717.5989999999997
properly or is it just assumed every

3716.64 --> 3720.5589999999997
time

3717.599 --> 3723.559
based on einstein's assumption of light

3720.559 --> 3723.559
speed

3752.64 --> 3755.839
this is

3756.24 --> 3761.0389999999998
that was a question by the way

3758.24 --> 3761.0389999999998
back to you

3763.839 --> 3770.0789999999997
do you think any light escapes the realm

3767.839 --> 3770.0789999999997
what

3776.64 --> 3778.8799999999997
well

3779.359 --> 3782.5589999999997
that

3781.2 --> 3785.359
well let me

3782.559 --> 3788.7200000000003
give you a very cryptic answer

3785.359 --> 3791.839
if there is no material in

3788.72 --> 3794.5589999999997
there in order to

3791.839 --> 3798.4
receive and reflect alter the light's

3794.559 --> 3798.4
course then does it really exist

3799.119 --> 3804.799
right if light is undetectable

3802.16 --> 3807.1189999999997
then how do you even know it is actually

3804.799 --> 3807.119
there

3809.76 --> 3815.599
right so even if there was some barrier

3813.2 --> 3817.52
somewhere

3815.599 --> 3820.48
and there's literally no

3817.52 --> 3823.2
volume outside of there

3820.48 --> 3824.48
for physical matter to exist in not even

3823.2 --> 3827.7599999999998
gas

3824.48 --> 3830.16
then maybe the light might seem to shine

3827.76 --> 3831.8390000000004
through the barrier

3830.16 --> 3834.16
and then give an impression that it

3831.839 --> 3837.2
might travel beyond

3834.16 --> 3839.7599999999998
but how do you know it exists there

3837.2 --> 3841.9199999999996
because there's no matter there to

3839.76 --> 3843.92
interact with it

3841.92 --> 3847.839
right and then it comes back down to

3843.92 --> 3847.839
what the hell is light

3848.0 --> 3851.559
what is it

3856.079 --> 3862.2400000000002
like as a substance right because it is

3859.119 --> 3865.52
absolutely nothing like matter

3862.24 --> 3867.839
or even electricity

3865.52 --> 3871.359
although it has more reminiscence with

3867.839 --> 3872.5589999999997
electricity than matter overall

3871.359 --> 3873.92
but

3872.559 --> 3877.6800000000003
how do you know

3873.92 --> 3881.559
it exists if there is no matter

3877.68 --> 3881.5589999999997
to interact with

3882.079 --> 3885.079
right

3894.48 --> 3900.96
i mean i guess you could

3897.2 --> 3900.96
test if for example

3901.28 --> 3907.1600000000003
yeah the most logical technically would

3904.16 --> 3907.16
be

3908.079 --> 3910.4
hmm

3911.76 --> 3916.1600000000003
i think i might have just solved my own

3913.76 --> 3916.1600000000003
question

3916.48 --> 3921.839
right so if you would shine create light

3919.92 --> 3923.599
shining through the barrier into the

3921.839 --> 3928.0
nothing

3923.599 --> 3930.4
then the light is still generated

3928.0 --> 3933.92
there's still an amount of lumen output

3930.4 --> 3935.2000000000003
how many lumens will eventually refract

3933.92 --> 3937.2000000000003
back

3935.2 --> 3941.2799999999997
into the physical realm

3937.2 --> 3941.2799999999997
where the lamp is that does that

3942.72 --> 3948.0789999999997
if you'd say like all of the lumens will

3945.839 --> 3952.0789999999997
be maintained then that could only

3948.079 --> 3954.4
function if the effective barrier

3952.079 --> 3956.799
of the material realm would be a perfect

3954.4 --> 3956.799
mirror

3958.16 --> 3962.8799999999997
right and if it's a perfect mirror you

3960.079 --> 3967.28
would never even be able to know whether

3962.88 --> 3969.6800000000003
there is physical material be beyond the

3967.28 --> 3972.4
physical realm

3969.68 --> 3974.16
right it's just an idea that a barrier

3972.4 --> 3976.559
might be transparent and you'd be

3974.16 --> 3979.359
looking into perfect

3976.559 --> 3982.96
eternal darkness beyond it it's just an

3979.359 --> 3985.52
idea i've never actually seen it guys

3982.96 --> 3988.4
really i haven't

3985.52 --> 3989.24
not even in my visions

3988.4 --> 3991.6800000000003
only

3989.24 --> 3994.72
reconstructions of my own conceptual

3991.68 --> 3997.68
ideas i have not actually wandered off

3994.72 --> 3997.68
with my spirit

3998.319 --> 4002.72
i have not attained the memories of

4000.16 --> 4005.5989999999997
anybody that has actually

4002.72 --> 4007.7599999999998
physically seen the barrier

4005.599 --> 4009.44
even though weirdly enough it was

4007.76 --> 4012.48
suggested that i did have the

4009.44 --> 4014.799
opportunity for that and then i said no

4012.48 --> 4014.799
thanks

4017.119 --> 4021.839
which in retrospect is kind of weird

4022.48 --> 4028.4
but i was operating in in the dark world

4025.52 --> 4031.119
vision on a quite a bizarre surreal

4028.4 --> 4031.119
level so

4031.359 --> 4034.359
uh

4042.48 --> 4046.28
atmospheric blocking

4053.44 --> 4057.359
that's hilarious steamy traveler yeah

4057.44 --> 4062.16
yeah technically if the air was clear

4060.0 --> 4064.24
enough over the distance right because

4062.16 --> 4066.72
the distance between the loop does

4064.24 --> 4068.799
matter right

4066.72 --> 4072.5589999999997
the optical instrument will have to

4068.799 --> 4074.48
actually bridge that entire distance

4072.559 --> 4077.44
but yes

4074.48 --> 4080.2400000000002
technically if the realm was looping but

4077.44 --> 4082.88
it would have to be a straight line loop

4080.24 --> 4085.7599999999998
otherwise it's not going to work

4082.88 --> 4089.119
if it was a straight line loop then yes

4085.76 --> 4091.119
you could see the back of your own head

4089.119 --> 4094.0
with a powerful enough telescope on a

4091.119 --> 4094.0
clear enough day

4096.08 --> 4103.88
it is theoretically possible

4099.44 --> 4103.879999999999
in that very specific setup

4104.96 --> 4110.159
but if it's not if the equator is

4107.6 --> 4113.96
basically not a straight line

4110.159 --> 4113.96
then it doesn't work

4139.12 --> 4144.5599999999995
the light is diffused when passing

4141.359 --> 4144.56
through different mediums

4144.839 --> 4149.359
yeah that's why it's important that the

4147.92 --> 4152.319
medium would be

4149.359 --> 4156.400000000001
it would have to be a super like

4152.319 --> 4156.400000000001
pretty much universal clear day

4158.239 --> 4164.3189999999995
over the entire width of the realm

4162.56 --> 4166.319
in order to accomplish that because if

4164.319 --> 4170.159000000001
there's clouds anywhere yeah you can't

4166.319 --> 4170.159000000001
see through those clouds right

4171.52 --> 4177.6
so maybe if you have like a a balloon

4175.359 --> 4178.4800000000005
super high up

4177.6 --> 4180.64
like

4178.48 --> 4182.718999999999
to the point where it's a super thin air

4180.64 --> 4185.6
and then

4182.719 --> 4189.839
then maybe over that fast distance the

4185.6 --> 4193.6
balloon could actually see itself

4189.839 --> 4193.6
with a powerful enough telescope

4195.199 --> 4199.28
but at ground level that's going to be

4196.96 --> 4202.679
very difficult i think

4199.28 --> 4202.679
maybe impossible

4226.8 --> 4231.2390000000005
thanks for the good questions by the way

4239.84 --> 4243.360000000001
you woke up right when it started to

4241.36 --> 4245.839999999999
stream

4243.36 --> 4245.839999999999
right

4264.08 --> 4271.0
i bet virus was sleepy in school a lot

4267.44 --> 4271.0
weren't you virus

4278.96 --> 4281.96
huh

4301.679 --> 4305.4800000000005
i knew it

4315.92 --> 4322.12
that's so typical

4318.0 --> 4322.12
that you slept through history

4341.76 --> 4345.4400000000005
no i loved english class i really loved

4344.64 --> 4347.52
it

4345.44 --> 4351.36
also because yeah

4347.52 --> 4354.2390000000005
teacher showed us like black adder and

4351.36 --> 4358.239
monty python's holy grail

4354.239 --> 4358.239
right it's the best class ever

4361.28 --> 4366.759999999999
but maybe it was just really lucky

4362.88 --> 4366.76
having a teacher like that

4374.56 --> 4379.04
i was also very interested in history

4381.6 --> 4385.6
but

4383.199 --> 4387.5199999999995
the main problem i always thought was

4385.6 --> 4390.2390000000005
like

4387.52 --> 4393.4400000000005
i just felt that it was actually an

4390.239 --> 4394.959999999999
assembled almost political story every

4393.44 --> 4396.4
time

4394.96 --> 4398.4
and that's the objections that i

4396.4 --> 4399.679
eventually got with history even dutch

4398.4 --> 4402.48
history

4399.679 --> 4403.679
and when i would ask the teacher they

4402.48 --> 4406.159
would be

4403.679 --> 4410.6
like they would become like suspicious

4406.159 --> 4410.599999999999
towards me was really weird

4414.48 --> 4418.32
it's like you're not supposed to

4415.92 --> 4420.56
question this but isn't that how we

4418.32 --> 4422.799999999999
figure out what's real and what isn't

4420.56 --> 4422.8
right

4423.84 --> 4429.12
but i i really did pay attention in

4426.0 --> 4429.12
history class though

4429.84 --> 4434.4800000000005
because i was especially just very

4431.92 --> 4437.4400000000005
interested in the ages past and what

4434.48 --> 4441.639999999999
people were like compared to

4437.44 --> 4441.639999999999
my lifetime age

4448.32 --> 4452.799999999999
right and it was always from the start

4450.32 --> 4455.44
very annoyed when people in the past

4452.8 --> 4458.1990000000005
were being downplayed like oh medieval

4455.44 --> 4460.08
people they were all just stupid and

4458.199 --> 4462.239
intoxicated and

4460.08 --> 4466.0
i'm like what

4462.239 --> 4466.839999999999
that just seems completely wrong like

4466.0 --> 4469.12
that's

4466.84 --> 4471.4400000000005
disrespectful to our ancestors like

4469.12 --> 4474.64
that's not how it would have been

4471.44 --> 4474.639999999999
who wrote this story

4479.679 --> 4484.08
anyway that was my response in my youth

4482.64 --> 4486.0
to history

4484.08 --> 4489.8
to history class and all that but it was

4486.0 --> 4489.8
always paying attention

4496.48 --> 4499.678999999999
right yeah

4498.0 --> 4503.679
well i was never good at that part

4499.679 --> 4506.4
either oh remember the names uh

4503.679 --> 4508.88
dude i'm i even have trouble remembering

4506.4 --> 4510.879999999999
the names of just people

4508.88 --> 4514.4800000000005
so

4510.88 --> 4517.92
let alone history names

4514.48 --> 4520.5599999999995
i mean after a long time in my life yeah

4517.92 --> 4522.719
i do remember

4520.56 --> 4525.92
most of it i guess most of the rough

4522.719 --> 4527.44
line the typical names

4525.92 --> 4530.08
but

4527.44 --> 4532.0
i was never a star at memorizing like

4530.08 --> 4534.4
every name and all that

4532.0 --> 4537.76
memorization in general

4534.4 --> 4540.879999999999
but i'm always i was always very in

4537.76 --> 4543.4400000000005
fascinated by the spirit of the

4540.88 --> 4545.76
situation and the time and always

4543.44 --> 4547.599999999999
basically trying to psychologize right

4545.76 --> 4551.360000000001
this is just me being a psychologist

4547.6 --> 4553.120000000001
again very early on

4551.36 --> 4556.08
to just like

4553.12 --> 4558.0
try to imagine what it was like for real

4556.08 --> 4561.76
and not some

4558.0 --> 4563.12
down played arrogant modern day

4561.76 --> 4566.0
snub

4563.12 --> 4568.08
view of it which a lot of other kids did

4566.0 --> 4569.76
have like a lot of kids weren't really

4568.08 --> 4571.84
interested and they just like oh it's

4569.76 --> 4574.88
just stupid

4571.84 --> 4574.88
old people

4575.12 --> 4579.92
and i'm like dude no way

4578.159 --> 4582.08
we should have some more respect for

4579.92 --> 4584.8
them

4582.08 --> 4584.8
but yeah

4586.64 --> 4590.96
eventually i got kind of tired of

4588.48 --> 4592.799999999999
history though because it was all about

4590.96 --> 4595.28
memorization and

4592.8 --> 4597.4400000000005
no critical inquiry and the critical

4595.28 --> 4599.44
inquiry is what i was all about was what

4597.44 --> 4601.678999999999
i was always doing just like i'm doing

4599.44 --> 4601.678999999999
now

4602.0 --> 4605.0
always

4608.0 --> 4613.44
because the stories written about

4610.88 --> 4613.4400000000005
somebody

4613.52 --> 4618.0
are usually even when it's written by

4615.76 --> 4619.679
themselves

4618.0 --> 4622.159
are usually

4619.679 --> 4624.159
especially after they're that

4622.159 --> 4626.799999999999
they don't really reflect who they

4624.159 --> 4630.32
really were

4626.8 --> 4630.320000000001
unless it is like a

4631.76 --> 4637.52
more like a fan written position like

4634.88 --> 4640.08
somebody that really appreciated them

4637.52 --> 4642.159000000001
personally and knows a lot about their

4640.08 --> 4644.4
ways and then they will describe those

4642.159 --> 4646.239
ways to give you a more realistic

4644.4 --> 4647.28
personal impression

4646.239 --> 4649.4
right that

4647.28 --> 4652.4
instead of some kind of a

4649.4 --> 4658.12
politicized framework

4652.4 --> 4658.12
of how to see that person in the past

4669.04 --> 4671.76
henry viii

4677.28 --> 4680.32
i don't remember that

4685.28 --> 4691.679
which of the major world religions do

4688.08 --> 4693.28
you feel have merit what

4691.679 --> 4695.76
okay now i have to look up the word

4693.28 --> 4695.759999999999
merit

4695.92 --> 4705.41
to get the refined context of

4698.19 --> 4705.41
[Applause]

4705.44 --> 4709.919999999999
the it of being good in gorothy okay

4713.28 --> 4716.28
ah

4721.04 --> 4724.8
i think all of them have married

4725.36 --> 4728.96
but

4726.239 --> 4731.04
none of them are perfect

4728.96 --> 4733.04
they're all a balance of

4731.04 --> 4738.159
of gravel

4733.04 --> 4739.84
and yeah community binding right

4738.159 --> 4742.879999999999
all religio it's like

4739.84 --> 4745.4400000000005
every organized religion sucks because

4742.88 --> 4746.4800000000005
of it's an organized religion

4745.44 --> 4748.639999999999
right

4746.48 --> 4751.199
and the grapplers that are

4748.64 --> 4753.4400000000005
playing games in social engineering and

4751.199 --> 4757.599999999999
politics perhaps

4753.44 --> 4760.639999999999
it always sucks on the other hand

4757.6 --> 4762.96
it's a community

4760.64 --> 4763.92
and you can

4762.96 --> 4765.56
like

4763.92 --> 4769.1990000000005
find a lot of

4765.56 --> 4773.360000000001
destination for social longings and

4769.199 --> 4775.599999999999
community feel within a religion

4773.36 --> 4777.36
so it's always a balance doesn't really

4775.6 --> 4779.679
matter which religion we're talking

4777.36 --> 4779.679
about

4780.159 --> 4783.28
they're all a balance between

4782.4 --> 4785.199
like

4783.28 --> 4787.28
grabblers and

4785.199 --> 4789.5199999999995
trying to mind control you

4787.28 --> 4791.599999999999
and manipulate you and steer you around

4789.52 --> 4794.159000000001
and

4791.6 --> 4795.76
like a proper community

4794.159 --> 4799.04
root system

4795.76 --> 4801.1990000000005
for you to find purpose

4799.04 --> 4802.48
on a spiritual level

4801.199 --> 4805.599999999999
right

4802.48 --> 4807.199
so yeah i know that's probably the most

4805.6 --> 4809.280000000001
unspecific

4807.199 --> 4812.28
answer i could ever give but that's my

4809.28 --> 4812.28
answer

4821.04 --> 4823.36
hmm

4828.08 --> 4833.84
ah goldie mckernan

4830.159 --> 4833.839999999999
yeah yeah oh god

4835.84 --> 4838.8
that that's really awesome that you had

4837.92 --> 4840.88
a

4838.8 --> 4844.0
a mom that would help you with like

4840.88 --> 4847.36
little tricks to remember [ __ ]

4844.0 --> 4849.6
for me how i remembered things

4847.36 --> 4852.239
is i would literally just parallel

4849.6 --> 4852.2390000000005
construct

4852.32 --> 4859.36
it's weird i would remember things

4855.6 --> 4861.84
by basically adding something that might

4859.36 --> 4864.159
have been there could be there

4861.84 --> 4865.4400000000005
it's like parallel construction and then

4864.159 --> 4869.92
because of the

4865.44 --> 4871.199
scaffolding i would be building

4869.92 --> 4874.0
i guess

4871.199 --> 4876.638999999999
i would remember it better

4874.0 --> 4878.8
if i wouldn't parallel construct with

4876.639 --> 4881.52
things like that

4878.8 --> 4883.84
then i wouldn't remember it because i

4881.52 --> 4885.4400000000005
wouldn't care i don't know

4883.84 --> 4887.4400000000005
that was a trick that i applied

4885.44 --> 4890.96
sometimes but i had to be very careful

4887.44 --> 4892.96
because if you just make up [ __ ]

4890.96 --> 4895.04
that would have technically consequences

4892.96 --> 4896.4800000000005
but there's no proof of that it actually

4895.04 --> 4898.48
happened

4896.48 --> 4900.879999999999
then

4898.48 --> 4903.839999999999
yeah things get messy and you get like

4900.88 --> 4905.36
confused

4903.84 --> 4907.92
as like arwen what the hell are you

4905.36 --> 4907.92
talking about

4909.28 --> 4911.759999999999
i don't know

4914.239 --> 4919.599999999999
but i used little tricks for math most

4917.28 --> 4921.5199999999995
of the time which were basically

4919.6 --> 4924.159000000001
applying sort of visual pattern

4921.52 --> 4927.4400000000005
recognition over actual calculation and

4924.159 --> 4929.599999999999
that worked really well for me

4927.44 --> 4932.08
but when it came to like memorizing

4929.6 --> 4932.08
names

4933.92 --> 4940.4800000000005
or even like

4936.56 --> 4943.280000000001
words like in the basic language

4940.48 --> 4944.718999999999
like when i had to learn french i would

4943.28 --> 4949.44
do like

4944.719 --> 4949.44
weird internal parallel constructions

4950.08 --> 4954.8
instead of learning the word piece by

4952.48 --> 4954.799999999999
piece

4954.96 --> 4959.679
i would sometimes even like if you have

4956.96 --> 4961.6
to remember like oh this verb and then

4959.679 --> 4964.8
in all forms

4961.6 --> 4967.360000000001
and then i would like make a visual

4964.8 --> 4969.84
sort of chart out of it in my mind and

4967.36 --> 4973.199
then i would remember the pattern of

4969.84 --> 4975.04
that visual chart and that way

4973.199 --> 4978.159
when i was confronted with the test i

4975.04 --> 4981.12
would know which word to roll out

4978.159 --> 4983.04
it's weird that's kind of like how i

4981.12 --> 4985.199
learned language in many ways through

4983.04 --> 4987.84
visual patterns that i parallel

4985.199 --> 4987.839999999999
constructed with

4992.08 --> 4997.04
okay steamy traveler

4994.4 --> 5000.08
i'm glad you like my show so much more

4997.04 --> 5002.0
