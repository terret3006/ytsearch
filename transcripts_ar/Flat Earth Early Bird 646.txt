121.6 --> 125.91999999999999
that

122.24 --> 130.07999999999998

yeah because i went out for groceries

153.84 --> 158.08
but it like it was weird man

156.08 --> 160.56
like every step the way there was a lot

158.08 --> 163.12
of delay for some reason

160.56 --> 164.72
basically asked certain things at the

163.12 --> 166.72
supermarket and then they couldn't

164.72 --> 167.68
figure it out and accidentally reset the

166.72 --> 171.35999999999999
computer and

167.68 --> 173.84
just took forever

171.36 --> 175.20000000000002
those things typically happen but yeah

173.84 --> 178.0
that's

175.2 --> 181.44
i quickly had to rush lunch make the

178.0 --> 181.44
coffee and then start the show

181.92 --> 188.79999999999998
but i'm here

240.64 --> 244.79899999999998
uh so yeah how are you guys all doing

248.159 --> 251.28
sunday yesterday was yeah it was a bit

250.239 --> 256.08
of a weird day

251.28 --> 256.08
but it was it was good still

256.639 --> 261.35900000000004
because after flat earth debates as

258.639 --> 264.72
predicted yeah the uh

261.359 --> 266.32
friday flat earth debate re-show

264.72 --> 268.56
after the early bird show yesterday

266.32 --> 272.479
after the yeah the flatter debate

268.56 --> 274.72
friday replay was out there with fight

272.479 --> 278.08
flat earth

274.72 --> 279.04
and just listening back to it he was

278.08 --> 283.84
even worse

279.04 --> 283.84000000000003
than i remembered

285.36 --> 289.209
pretty amazing

286.17 --> 289.209
[Music]

289.52 --> 293.84
because yeah during the live show i was

292.72 --> 296.47900000000004
in the google

293.84 --> 297.52
panel and then yeah everything's get

296.479 --> 299.68
gets gated

297.52 --> 301.28
through nathan since fight to flatter it

299.68 --> 303.28000000000003
was a discord

301.28 --> 305.67999999999995
but yeah hearing it live on the show he

303.28 --> 308.79999999999995
was even rumpusing and being

305.68 --> 311.84000000000003
annoying more than i could hear live

308.8 --> 311.84000000000003
pretty incredible

314.08 --> 322.84
huh ah good servant in the house

318.56 --> 325.84
stressful week last week thank

322.84 --> 325.84
um

327.6 --> 332.16
yeah yeah i'm having weird situation

329.919 --> 332.15999999999997
yeah

332.24 --> 335.759
like my jaw is playing up again but it's

334.8 --> 339.44
not as bad

335.759 --> 342.639
as i've experienced it before

339.44 --> 342.639
but i am noticing

342.96 --> 347.919
i don't know maybe it's that yeah with

344.639 --> 347.919
the smoking especially

349.36 --> 355.68
like i have to currently at least tone

352.72 --> 357.44000000000005
yeah significantly decrease the um the

355.68 --> 359.12
amount of times that i smoke because

357.44 --> 361.6
every time

359.12 --> 362.8
it depends on what the time of the day

361.6 --> 366.639
is

362.8 --> 370.24
but yeah it every time i have smoked

366.639 --> 372.40000000000003
it seems like my bones in my jaw

370.24 --> 374.0
seems to want to migrate and stuff you

372.4 --> 375.84
know there's like weird pressure

374.0 --> 380.479
situations going on

375.84 --> 384.56
so it's

380.479 --> 386.56
all right and i think i as a side effect

384.56 --> 389.199
of it or tied in with it i have a little

386.56 --> 394.479
bit of a cold but

389.199 --> 395.91900000000004
not really serious

394.479 --> 397.75899999999996
yeah but it is annoying hey that's

395.919 --> 401.52
typically what happens you know

397.759 --> 404.56
during the during the transition

401.52 --> 405.919
it'll be fine actually a good

404.56 --> 409.599
opportunity for me to

405.919 --> 411.84
seriously cut down on my expenditures

409.599 --> 415.52
cannabis which is an expenditure now i

411.84 --> 417.599
have cut down the expenditure

415.52 --> 418.79999999999995
the money it costs for my tobacco at

417.599 --> 421.52
least

418.8 --> 422.24
because i got the whole leaves and i

421.52 --> 425.44
still have

422.24 --> 430.479
plenty for a long time to come and it is

425.44 --> 433.36
better but yeah with cannabis and

430.479 --> 433.35999999999996
won't be able to

433.52 --> 437.84
yeah get the same levels of discount

443.759 --> 451.84000000000003
the flatter is live julio pepin

453.199 --> 458.0
all right what

458.319 --> 462.24
yeah anyway after that uh there was no

461.039 --> 465.039
own benjamin

462.24 --> 466.56
that i could find that was live i don't

465.039 --> 467.44
know but he had a great yeah he had a

466.56 --> 471.68
good enough show

467.44 --> 473.599
saturday so i don't know um

471.68 --> 475.28000000000003
it's a bit quiet because of that and of

473.599 --> 476.4
course there's like the other ball

475.28 --> 481.44
busters and all that

476.4 --> 481.44
later but i don't really watch that uh

484.879 --> 488.56
i think they were forwarding this flat

487.759 --> 491.319
earth couple

488.56 --> 494.24
or something i did i did click on it for

491.319 --> 497.03900000000004
a while and then then saw that and

494.24 --> 497.84000000000003
just okay these people are being

497.039 --> 500.08
promoted

497.84 --> 500.08
sure

501.12 --> 506.72
still no robin yeah that i haven't heard

503.52 --> 508.56
from robin in a while i was wondering

506.72 --> 511.91900000000004
about that yesterday as well

508.56 --> 511.919
thinking about it like where is she

513.279 --> 517.519
she's last been on skype two days ago

517.839 --> 520.9590000000001
but i think she's just really busy you

519.68 --> 524.64
know she's

520.959 --> 527.1999999999999
like moving houses

524.64 --> 528.24
so it's not even moving rooms it's

527.2 --> 532.0
literally moving an

528.24 --> 533.36
entire house yeah that takes a long time

532.0 --> 535.76
so

533.36 --> 536.88
any status of that with the new girl oh

535.76 --> 541.279
jesus

536.88 --> 541.279
uh no i haven't bumped into her

542.48 --> 549.839
unfortunately and yeah with my jaw

546.64 --> 549.8389999999999
and this weather i

551.519 --> 554.8
i don't really i don't really feel or

554.24 --> 557.6800000000001
i'm too

554.8 --> 558.4799999999999
chicken or it seems too much of a hassle

557.68 --> 561.5999999999999
to just

558.48 --> 564.88
go downstairs and just say hello

561.6 --> 567.2
that's it that that sounds really stupid

564.88 --> 570.24
coming out of my mouth

567.2 --> 570.24
but it is what it is

574.88 --> 579.6
you know but at the same time look there

577.6 --> 581.9200000000001
is a lot of girls around

579.6 --> 581.9200000000001
women

582.88 --> 587.04
and yeah she's not the only interesting

586.16 --> 589.36
girl that i've

587.04 --> 592.56
bumped into sort of although this one is

589.36 --> 592.5600000000001
like very close at home

592.88 --> 596.08
but yeah no updates

596.24 --> 600.16
not going on any dates just yet

602.56 --> 606.88
what's up with the jaw it's yeah tom

605.76 --> 608.88
parker it's always

606.88 --> 609.92
well it's not always like that but it is

608.88 --> 613.04
like a

609.92 --> 616.959
i don't know physiological

613.04 --> 621.1999999999999
problem or skeletal issue

616.959 --> 623.4399999999999
maybe it at some point some

621.2 --> 626.32
something broke or there's like this

623.44 --> 629.36
hair fracture in

626.32 --> 630.5600000000001
in there somewhere because of getting

629.36 --> 634.32
bashed in the face

630.56 --> 637.04
which has happened in the past

634.32 --> 637.839
taekwondo and all that and could be that

637.04 --> 640.959
it just can't

637.839 --> 643.44
properly heal and

640.959 --> 644.56
that yeah because almost every year it

643.44 --> 647.12
just comes back

644.56 --> 648.16
and gets annoying you know other people

647.12 --> 651.76
like

648.16 --> 652.48
always get headaches there's in such

651.76 --> 654.64
ways

652.48 --> 657.279
i don't get always headaches thank god i

654.64 --> 660.48
used to have that a lot by the way

657.279 --> 661.04
when i was young i didn't have this no i

660.48 --> 665.2
got

661.04 --> 668.64
how do you call that like the

665.2 --> 671.6800000000001
pressure in the sinuses that [ __ ] i

668.64 --> 673.1999999999999
i don't have that anymore that very very

671.68 --> 675.12
rarely happens

673.2 --> 676.24
but my jaw is like always the first

675.12 --> 679.839
thing

676.24 --> 683.6800000000001
it's like the canary in the coal mine

679.839 --> 683.6800000000001
of my bone structures so

687.519 --> 691.12
what does what

694.0 --> 696.88
no tooth issues

697.279 --> 702.56
no no no no but they do

700.399 --> 703.839
get agitated by it as well you know

702.56 --> 707.279
remember

703.839 --> 709.6800000000001
remember if you even want to ooh

707.279 --> 712.639
our winds medical profile it's so

709.68 --> 716.0
interesting it's so interesting about

712.639 --> 717.519
my grandpa stories about my health

716.0 --> 719.44
sorry this is kind of what it feels like

717.519 --> 722.9590000000001
at this point but

719.44 --> 725.12
yeah sometimes can get bad and then

722.959 --> 727.1199999999999
pressure kind of pushes down on the

725.12 --> 730.5600000000001
nerve endings of my

727.12 --> 732.48
of my yeah of my teeth

730.56 --> 735.1999999999999
and that can be kind of painful but it's

732.48 --> 737.6800000000001
never literally a toothache

735.2 --> 739.76
you know my tooth situation is kind of

737.68 --> 742.6389999999999
weird

739.76 --> 743.519
got plenty of hollow spaces and all that

742.639 --> 747.04
and even though

743.519 --> 748.88
it's still that yeah broken one but it's

747.04 --> 750.639
i don't know it's not getting worse it's

748.88 --> 753.68
it's okay

750.639 --> 756.32
yeah chewing isn't what it used to be

753.68 --> 757.3599999999999
but hey i'm surviving i'm managing i

756.32 --> 760.72
really hope that

757.36 --> 762.9590000000001
one day in the

760.72 --> 764.88
i hope to say not too distant future but

762.959 --> 769.3599999999999
again guaranteed i will get a

764.88 --> 771.92
big opportunity to go to a really good

769.36 --> 773.04
dentist and like put down a few thousand

771.92 --> 776.639
euros and and

773.04 --> 779.76
really fix the situation

776.639 --> 782.48
because yeah

779.76 --> 783.04
having certain issues with just chewing

782.48 --> 786.639
food

783.04 --> 789.04
is kind of annoying although i still

786.639 --> 789.04
manage

793.279 --> 801.8389999999999
what is what do you mean a dry socket by

795.519 --> 801.839
the way flatters life

812.839 --> 816.8800000000001
um

814.48 --> 819.279
right yeah good service you wanted me on

816.88 --> 819.279
the show

819.76 --> 831.12
yeah i'm okay with that so yeah i

828.88 --> 833.4399999999999
by the way i didn't even make a note of

831.12 --> 835.519
it but i did watch

833.44 --> 838.32
my own show back yesterday from

835.519 --> 838.32
beginning to end

840.639 --> 845.76
i titled it the three ways to interpret

843.68 --> 849.5999999999999
rules

845.76 --> 853.04
and yes i was yeah

849.6 --> 855.519
kind of impressed not my ego but just of

853.04 --> 858.8
the concept arriving and

855.519 --> 861.839
it really made me think like

858.8 --> 865.04
yeah you can kind of divide

861.839 --> 868.1600000000001
everything up it it is like the attitude

865.04 --> 870.56
it is how do you

868.16 --> 871.8389999999999
how do you handle the rules what are you

870.56 --> 874.3199999999999
doing with them

871.839 --> 875.0400000000001
what are you seeking out what is your

874.32 --> 877.9200000000001
focus

875.04 --> 881.279
with them what is your objective and

877.92 --> 884.079
yeah this is important because

881.279 --> 885.519
that's the way to interpret the rules

884.079 --> 888.6389999999999
basically

885.519 --> 888.639
or yeah

889.6 --> 892.16
so it's

893.76 --> 900.3199999999999
it's something that's not addressed

897.12 --> 904.399
like that very often

900.32 --> 908.0
instead people out there and in media

904.399 --> 910.56
like to instead emphasize one particular

908.0 --> 914.24
aspect and per definition

910.56 --> 917.5999999999999
one approach and per definition exclude

914.24 --> 919.6
others so in their own way

917.6 --> 922.9590000000001
almost everyone has a tendency to have

919.6 --> 922.9590000000001
the second approach

924.399 --> 930.24
although yeah many still try to keep

927.44 --> 932.48
the spirit of the rules in their mind as

930.24 --> 932.48
well

934.32 --> 942.32
and yeah of course half the world now

938.32 --> 942.32
is in using the third method

943.12 --> 947.519
and not half the world but it is kind of

945.279 --> 950.16
what is driving things forward

947.519 --> 952.16
you know third way to follow rules is

950.16 --> 953.92
the corporate way

952.16 --> 957.12
so how do you break all the rules

953.92 --> 960.4799999999999
without breaking the rules

957.12 --> 962.48
to maximize control

960.48 --> 963.9200000000001
whatever it is exactly well that is

962.48 --> 966.639
usually why you want to

963.92 --> 967.5999999999999
do that you want to have control over

966.639 --> 971.12
the rules

967.6 --> 973.36
over what set the rules

971.12 --> 974.9590000000001
and you want to be free to be whatever

973.36 --> 977.6
you want

974.959 --> 978.6389999999999
and to think whatever you want including

977.6 --> 982.0
things that are wrong

978.639 --> 985.44
and evil and yeah you want to be the

982.0 --> 987.44
judge basically of yourself

985.44 --> 990.5600000000001
so any rules that are forwarded to you

987.44 --> 990.5600000000001
you will focus on

991.36 --> 994.9590000000001
breaking or bypassing putting those

993.68 --> 997.519
rules out of the way

994.959 --> 998.88
without breaking them because yeah

997.519 --> 1002.32
technically breaking

998.88 --> 1010.8
rules will have consequences

1002.32 --> 1012.72
of course if they are not secret rules

1010.8 --> 1014.8
yeah who's going to set the rules well

1012.72 --> 1016.8000000000001
if they're going to set the rules then

1014.8 --> 1018.56
it's very likely they're going to try to

1016.8 --> 1020.16
enforce it because otherwise it's just

1018.56 --> 1023.4399999999999
not going to mean anything

1020.16 --> 1026.3999999999999
but at the same time the third

1023.44 --> 1028.24
the third method rule following people

1026.4 --> 1030.24
rabblers

1028.24 --> 1033.28
they do their best to basically give the

1030.24 --> 1036.799
impression that there is no rules at all

1033.28 --> 1038.959
that the only rules is their rules but

1036.799 --> 1041.12
that's partially bro bluff because there

1038.959 --> 1043.76
are rules there is a god and

1041.12 --> 1045.6
there is logos there is a system of how

1043.76 --> 1048.4
things work

1045.6 --> 1050.1599999999999
and it's all kind of been worked out but

1048.4 --> 1052.64
then convoluted and forgotten

1050.16 --> 1053.76
and reinterpreted thanks to the second

1052.64 --> 1056.5590000000002
approach

1053.76 --> 1057.76
and the third approach of interpreting

1056.559 --> 1060.6399999999999
rules

1057.76 --> 1061.919
but yeah in essence all the rules are

1060.64 --> 1064.64
still there they are still

1061.919 --> 1066.0
as they used to be it's just the people

1064.64 --> 1071.1200000000001
and aren't paying attention

1066.0 --> 1074.08
or that are being fooled about the rules

1071.12 --> 1080.3999999999999
right so yeah a little feedback about

1074.08 --> 1083.52
the rules the rules

1080.4 --> 1086.799
right i also finished up watching

1083.52 --> 1089.6
the second season of kobukai and was

1086.799 --> 1089.9189999999999
pretty damn intense man like they had

1089.6 --> 1093.039
this

1089.919 --> 1096.48
final battle scene and it was really big

1093.039 --> 1098.96
that was like action movie big

1096.48 --> 1101.76
dude that was like and also like that

1098.96 --> 1104.32
school is completely

1101.76 --> 1104.32
that's cool

1104.799 --> 1110.8799999999999
it is the yeah that specific

1108.16 --> 1112.3200000000002
scene and it was very cool it was like

1110.88 --> 1114.96
really cool karate

1112.32 --> 1117.12
choreography very long very intense very

1114.96 --> 1120.32
heavy very exciting

1117.12 --> 1123.4399999999998
but it is kind of a throwback to the 80s

1120.32 --> 1124.559
because that sort of setup lasting that

1123.44 --> 1126.559
long

1124.559 --> 1128.3999999999999
indeed in this age could never happen

1126.559 --> 1131.9189999999999
because literally just the horde of

1128.4 --> 1136.0
police would start storming in and just

1131.919 --> 1138.3200000000002
yeah because they like went on fighting

1136.0 --> 1139.44
for like half an hour or something and

1138.32 --> 1142.1599999999999
trashing [ __ ]

1139.44 --> 1143.1200000000001
it's like what the [ __ ] in school this

1142.16 --> 1145.919
is

1143.12 --> 1148.2399999999998
that's very unlikely in reality but well

1145.919 --> 1148.48
as a scene as a as a part of the movie

1148.24 --> 1151.76
or

1148.48 --> 1157.2
the series was very exciting

1151.76 --> 1160.799
anyway yeah there are some plot twists

1157.2 --> 1162.8400000000001
and some curiosities and i'm very very

1160.799 --> 1164.6399999999999
curious how the third season is going to

1162.84 --> 1166.48
continue

1164.64 --> 1168.0800000000002
because they certainly did make a couple

1166.48 --> 1179.84
of big changes

1168.08 --> 1179.84
at the end of the second season

1187.52 --> 1190.559
right michael jones

1190.96 --> 1194.32
well you know that's kind of funny

1193.84 --> 1197.6789999999999
because

1194.32 --> 1200.8799999999999
in a way grabblers deep down inside

1197.679 --> 1200.88
also like that rule

1203.2 --> 1207.679
you know when you like trickery when you

1204.88 --> 1211.0390000000002
like fooling people

1207.679 --> 1213.919
and taking advantage of that system

1211.039 --> 1214.48
then you kind of well you should unless

1213.919 --> 1216.4
you're just

1214.48 --> 1217.919
such a squirter that you're not even a

1216.4 --> 1220.72
person anymore

1217.919 --> 1222.48
you should expect it back you should

1220.72 --> 1227.3600000000001
want others to test you too

1222.48 --> 1227.3600000000001
it's weird because i had that it's

1227.6 --> 1232.8799999999999
not it's not always the most sensible

1230.32 --> 1232.8799999999999
thing to do

1232.96 --> 1241.039
but in a way i like wanted to be tested

1237.52 --> 1245.12
like that but

1241.039 --> 1248.0
despite that i didn't want to

1245.12 --> 1248.0
create havoc

1254.72 --> 1258.799
you know in waze i was very much

1256.88 --> 1259.7600000000002
confronted with all kinds of grabbler

1258.799 --> 1264.48
methods

1259.76 --> 1266.72
systems for the jesuit guy principles

1264.48 --> 1267.76
and i kind of couldn't help but respect

1266.72 --> 1270.24
it

1267.76 --> 1271.44
at first for the for the rules

1270.24 --> 1274.48
themselves and

1271.44 --> 1276.24
how that would theoretically work but it

1274.48 --> 1278.24
the more time passed the more it seemed

1276.24 --> 1281.1200000000001
like an ideology and they actually

1278.24 --> 1284.96
didn't really follow the rules it was

1281.12 --> 1287.1589999999999
more like a spell to keep people in line

1284.96 --> 1289.679
to give the impression that they are

1287.159 --> 1292.0800000000002
trustworthy that they do follow rules

1289.679 --> 1292.88
even though those rules would be insane

1292.08 --> 1296.24
well in the end

1292.88 --> 1299.3600000000001
they don't they just don't

1296.24 --> 1301.44
it's all bluff it's all [ __ ] all of

1299.36 --> 1304.8799999999999
it

1301.44 --> 1306.0800000000002
only hold their rules for as long as it

1304.88 --> 1309.8400000000001
is

1306.08 --> 1309.84
handy to them yeah

1313.44 --> 1317.2
but yeah i thought it was fascinating

1315.6 --> 1319.4399999999998
and i kind of even

1317.2 --> 1321.679
tried to conceptualize like a noble

1319.44 --> 1324.72
variety of it

1321.679 --> 1328.0
because i like the testing part i

1324.72 --> 1330.84
like like

1328.0 --> 1332.08
yeah grabbers want to exploit people's

1330.84 --> 1337.28
foolishness

1332.08 --> 1337.28
but i kind of like to test it

1338.0 --> 1344.0
you know it's like poking and then

1340.4 --> 1344.0
seeing what happens with the poking

1344.64 --> 1348.0800000000002
how will they respond will they double

1346.32 --> 1350.1589999999999
down or will they

1348.08 --> 1351.6
actually take a challenge and try to

1350.159 --> 1355.44
overcome what make

1351.6 --> 1355.4399999999998
made them pokable in the first place

1356.96 --> 1361.28
right i i kind of got that concept out

1360.0 --> 1364.799
of it

1361.28 --> 1365.9189999999999
but i guess that was my own mind that

1364.799 --> 1369.12
tried to just

1365.919 --> 1371.2
always find the most ideal and great

1369.12 --> 1372.3999999999999
things in anything even when you

1371.2 --> 1375.2
shouldn't

1372.4 --> 1375.679
and i found that out later i you know it

1375.2 --> 1378.799
was a

1375.679 --> 1380.799
big disappointment because at first i

1378.799 --> 1382.559
really thought i was onto something i

1380.799 --> 1385.52
thought that i could basically like

1382.559 --> 1387.2
fix it yeah there we go again irwin

1385.52 --> 1389.52
thinks he can fix it

1387.2 --> 1390.24
to fix the world you just fix the

1389.52 --> 1393.9189999999999
grabblers

1390.24 --> 1394.6
yeah sure this is how that turned out to

1393.919 --> 1397.8400000000001
be

1394.6 --> 1400.84
absolutely stupid

1397.84 --> 1402.24
now why because they don't want to be

1400.84 --> 1404.32
fixed

1402.24 --> 1405.6
terrified to be fixed because when

1404.32 --> 1408.559
they're fixed

1405.6 --> 1409.9189999999999
they're confronted with everything they

1408.559 --> 1414.6399999999999
did

1409.919 --> 1414.64
to postpone and prevent being fixed

1418.48 --> 1423.6
anyway are you talking about golden

1421.2 --> 1423.6000000000001
rules

1428.24 --> 1431.919
golden rule is you who has the gold

1430.48 --> 1434.72
rules

1431.919 --> 1434.72
not really

1438.88 --> 1446.7990000000002
now you don't rule just by having gold

1444.32 --> 1449.76
you can have all the gold you like if

1446.799 --> 1452.24
you can't protect it

1449.76 --> 1453.44
if people don't respect you they're just

1452.24 --> 1456.48
gonna take it

1453.44 --> 1459.8400000000001
you don't rule by having gold no no no

1456.48 --> 1459.84
you rule by

1460.72 --> 1469.279
people thinking you have the goals

1465.84 --> 1470.32
and trusting that you will be able to

1469.279 --> 1473.84
keep it

1470.32 --> 1473.84
from them

1478.159 --> 1483.919
or make you part of their authority and

1481.279 --> 1487.679
there before

1483.919 --> 1490.72
i don't know may make you touch the gold

1487.679 --> 1492.64
in an indirect way you know maybe

1490.72 --> 1494.88
have gained the ability to deal with it

1492.64 --> 1497.1200000000001
but yeah i hope you guys know what i

1494.88 --> 1497.1200000000001
mean

1497.2 --> 1501.039
just having gold it's useless it's just

1499.76 --> 1504.48
a very heavy metal

1501.039 --> 1508.08
it's very shiny stands out

1504.48 --> 1508.08
it's not very easy to hide

1508.799 --> 1515.84
oh well technically it is kind of yeah

1510.559 --> 1515.84
you could just bury it in the ground but

1517.279 --> 1533.279
yeah anyway

1529.6 --> 1533.279
they give you a stake in the game

1540.84 --> 1543.84
right

1545.919 --> 1552.7990000000002
and instead of driving that stake

1549.44 --> 1556.559
through their vampiric hearts you drive

1552.799 --> 1560.8799999999999
it in the ground

1556.559 --> 1571.52
and lay your claim of your spot

1560.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
of dirt

1571.52 --> 1585.84
hey man you good morning

1597.76 --> 1602.799
but am i right am i right stakes good

1600.4 --> 1605.76
for two things

1602.799 --> 1605.76
building fences

1606.32 --> 1613.84
and killing vampires

1638.84 --> 1641.84
hmm

1654.24 --> 1659.6
what drives the trolls or the third way

1657.12 --> 1659.6
of course

1660.559 --> 1669.84
like trolls are basically very

1663.6 --> 1669.84
disorganized gravelers

1678.24 --> 1683.039
or disorganized pharisees you know

1680.399 --> 1685.76
grappler yeah

1683.039 --> 1686.8799999999999
i like to call a lot of things grabblers

1685.76 --> 1691.2
even those that

1686.88 --> 1694.24
do not necessarily equate

1691.2 --> 1697.44
to the specific religious group or

1694.24 --> 1700.559
however they deem themselves

1697.44 --> 1702.0800000000002
so it's more like pharisees than i just

1700.559 --> 1704.799
like the word grappler

1702.08 --> 1705.6
because it's so emphasizing just the

1704.799 --> 1707.9189999999999
attitude

1705.6 --> 1710.32
you know that's why i like the word more

1707.919 --> 1711.279
it's not because oh i can finally give a

1710.32 --> 1715.36
word to that

1711.279 --> 1717.36
group no it's about the actions it's

1715.36 --> 1720.32
about the attitude

1717.36 --> 1720.32
that's why i like it

1722.96 --> 1731.0
anyway oh thank you mandy young

1726.88 --> 1734.16
paypal you say let me check it out

1731.0 --> 1734.16
[Music]

1736.84 --> 1745.4399999999998
um

1739.6 --> 1753.84
monday ooh thank you very much

1745.44 --> 1753.8400000000001
yes that's very nice

1757.2 --> 1768.159
definitely keep me going

1766.24 --> 1769.84
thank you very much emmanuel for your

1768.159 --> 1781.8400000000001
support

1769.84 --> 1781.84
it's gonna help a lot

1785.6 --> 1789.039
all right yeah good for servant

1787.36 --> 1790.8799999999999
pharisees

1789.039 --> 1794.48
but yeah the issue also is is that

1790.88 --> 1797.5200000000002
grabblers are so much about control

1794.48 --> 1797.52
while pharisees

1797.76 --> 1805.52
not necessarily even that

1801.84 --> 1808.1589999999999
they're not necessary like they're not

1805.52 --> 1809.36
method yeah they're not methodically

1808.159 --> 1812.0
evil

1809.36 --> 1813.52
like grabblers are methodically evil

1812.0 --> 1816.48
like the evil they

1813.52 --> 1818.48
made it into a consistent effective

1816.48 --> 1821.44
method

1818.48 --> 1822.0
that gives them an edge pharisees just

1821.44 --> 1825.1200000000001
don't give

1822.0 --> 1828.399
a [ __ ] that's the difference

1825.12 --> 1831.76
they just don't care they're just

1828.399 --> 1835.279
they don't want to be stopped by any

1831.76 --> 1837.12
godly concepts impulses or principles

1835.279 --> 1839.52
that's the see there is still a

1837.12 --> 1842.799
difference

1839.52 --> 1846.32
it's complex like how do you

1842.799 --> 1848.72
it's a giant soup of frequencies and

1846.32 --> 1851.2
principles and actions and religious

1848.72 --> 1854.0
group and

1851.2 --> 1855.3600000000001
genetic groups who knows and yeah you

1854.0 --> 1858.48
gotta point at

1855.36 --> 1858.9599999999998
an effect and then just say okay this is

1858.48 --> 1862.08
that

1858.96 --> 1863.279
well yeah it's kind of difficult because

1862.08 --> 1867.84
it's a giant

1863.279 --> 1871.12
pile of amalgamations and concepts and

1867.84 --> 1871.12
vague territories

1871.84 --> 1877.6
and yeah gravelers could definitely be

1875.6 --> 1880.7199999999998
classified as pharisees

1877.6 --> 1885.84
but not all pharisees would be grabblers

1880.72 --> 1885.84
does that make sense it does to me

1886.08 --> 1893.84
after what i just explained anyway

1898.21 --> 1901.259
[Music]

1908.24 --> 1913.679
oh oh i'm fatigued

1911.76 --> 1916.24
you need me to talk about flat earth if

1913.679 --> 1916.24
you want to

1919.12 --> 1927.84
i'm just talking about people

1924.159 --> 1930.88
and rules and religion

1927.84 --> 1934.1589999999999
at it at yeah at the moment as well as

1930.88 --> 1936.3200000000002
yesterday if there's something

1934.159 --> 1938.48
flat earth related that needs to be

1936.32 --> 1940.72
discussed that's fine but yeah

1938.48 --> 1942.24
these days in the last month at least

1940.72 --> 1946.0
with the ballers

1942.24 --> 1946.0
it's just more nonsense

1946.559 --> 1950.1589999999999
like we're barely making any serious

1949.36 --> 1952.1589999999999
progress

1950.159 --> 1954.0800000000002
in our discoveries or and current

1952.159 --> 1956.3200000000002
conceptions even because we're mostly

1954.08 --> 1956.32
just

1957.2 --> 1960.799
yeah dealing with ballers that are just

1960.0 --> 1965.44
making things

1960.799 --> 1968.799
worse for themselves derailing of words

1965.44 --> 1970.72
trying to gaslight us by saying words

1968.799 --> 1972.32
don't mean what they actually mean but

1970.72 --> 1974.559
they mean something else which is more

1972.32 --> 1977.12
convenient to them

1974.559 --> 1977.9189999999999
for stupid little mind-bending trick so

1977.12 --> 1979.6789999999999
so it

1977.919 --> 1981.6000000000001
seems like the ball earth would get a

1979.679 --> 1983.44
little bit more legitimacy

1981.6 --> 1986.48
yeah that i think that a lot of the

1983.44 --> 1989.76
ballers are at this point literally

1986.48 --> 1993.2
put their hearts behind just

1989.76 --> 1996.799
completely destroying all knowledge

1993.2 --> 2000.32
all language like they set their

1996.799 --> 2003.2
their their will to that specifically

2000.32 --> 2004.72
because it is kind of the last resort to

2003.2 --> 2009.44
get the ball back like

2004.72 --> 2013.519
okay maybe if we just destroy language

2009.44 --> 2016.3200000000002
and in yeah inside logic if we just

2013.519 --> 2019.44
completely erase it turn it all around

2016.32 --> 2021.6789999999999
like completely make a giant junk pile

2019.44 --> 2024.3990000000001
of all academics that's what they want

2021.679 --> 2025.1200000000001
they could just do that then maybe

2024.399 --> 2028.7199999999998
people

2025.12 --> 2029.76
will give up out there actually trying

2028.72 --> 2031.84
to figure that out

2029.76 --> 2033.44
being specific and just get back on the

2031.84 --> 2036.72
ball again you know i think

2033.44 --> 2036.72
we're at that stage now

2040.159 --> 2044.159
because there's absolutely nowhere else

2042.399 --> 2045.9189999999999
to go

2044.159 --> 2048.8
only thing left for them is just a

2045.919 --> 2051.839
direct assault on all

2048.8 --> 2056.3990000000003
intellectualism and all

2051.839 --> 2056.399
logic on language itself

2056.639 --> 2060.32
nothing left except for the story here

2058.8 --> 2063.28
you can always have stories

2060.32 --> 2064.48
and sayings there's still language

2063.28 --> 2067.28
especially english is

2064.48 --> 2068.079
full of heliocentric sayings and you can

2067.28 --> 2070.3990000000003
always

2068.079 --> 2071.119
resort to that just to remind everyone

2070.399 --> 2073.839
see

2071.119 --> 2077.28
it's normalized everybody knows what i

2073.839 --> 2080.0
mean by using this heliocentric saying

2077.28 --> 2082.3990000000003
yeah yeah that's very very cute and you

2080.0 --> 2084.32
can probably keep on using that

2082.399 --> 2086.159
for a very long time to come because

2084.32 --> 2086.8790000000004
those kind of habits are very tough to

2086.159 --> 2089.9190000000003
get out

2086.879 --> 2092.399
even if you want them to you know

2089.919 --> 2094.24
there's a lot of words even to this day

2092.399 --> 2097.92
in english and in dutch

2094.24 --> 2099.2799999999997
english especially that are like very

2097.92 --> 2102.2400000000002
old

2099.28 --> 2103.92
used words from like the 18th century in

2102.24 --> 2106.4799999999996
the 19th century

2103.92 --> 2108.2400000000002
that literally nobody even really knows

2106.48 --> 2110.2400000000002
what they mean anymore unless they're

2108.24 --> 2112.4799999999996
a linguist unless they really know their

2110.24 --> 2115.52
language

2112.48 --> 2118.88
but yeah those words kept

2115.52 --> 2119.28
on pulling through as a cultural thing

2118.88 --> 2121.92
people

2119.28 --> 2124.1600000000003
just took the old word used it because

2121.92 --> 2125.2000000000003
it had such an old grain it had an old

2124.16 --> 2127.839
spirit

2125.2 --> 2130.3199999999997
and they use it for that all the ballers

2127.839 --> 2132.32
now out there and the media people

2130.32 --> 2134.6400000000003
their failed heliocentric religion

2132.32 --> 2138.6400000000003
they're trying to hold up

2134.64 --> 2140.7999999999997
they are left to that as well

2138.64 --> 2142.0789999999997
because they have no more power not

2140.8 --> 2145.119
really it's all

2142.079 --> 2145.92
nonsense now so that you could just try

2145.119 --> 2148.8
to

2145.92 --> 2150.4
resort back to the to the cultural

2148.8 --> 2154.5600000000004
influence that they managed

2150.4 --> 2157.04
to have through the 20th century

2154.56 --> 2160.0789999999997
and just fall back to the old sayings

2157.04 --> 2162.0
and see if they can keep people there

2160.079 --> 2164.2400000000002
don't think about it just remember all

2162.0 --> 2167.2
the heliocentric saying see it's a part

2164.24 --> 2169.2
of the language because it must be true

2167.2 --> 2170.7999999999997
not because we're gonna reason out how

2169.2 --> 2174.0789999999997
it works and then

2170.8 --> 2176.7200000000003
make it work no it's because

2174.079 --> 2179.52
everybody believed it so much that the

2176.72 --> 2181.4399999999996
language was adapted

2179.52 --> 2182.56
so it must be true because why would the

2181.44 --> 2186.48
entire language

2182.56 --> 2187.599
adapt to that see basically more peer

2186.48 --> 2189.839
pressure more

2187.599 --> 2201.839
peer review more body of science talk

2189.839 --> 2201.839
like that

2202.8 --> 2205.8390000000004
yeah there's plenty of people out there

2205.52 --> 2208.64
that

2205.839 --> 2210.7999999999997
that are pretty good at it you know alex

2208.64 --> 2212.96
jones is one of those people he's like

2210.8 --> 2217.119
always trying to pluck every

2212.96 --> 2217.119
heliocentric scene he can find

2218.4 --> 2223.6800000000003
and just bring it on the table at every

2220.96 --> 2223.68
opportunity

2224.24 --> 2229.839
it really stands out that he does that

2230.72 --> 2235.4399999999996
maybe he sees it as an art he just does

2233.28 --> 2235.44
it

2235.68 --> 2239.9199999999996
because i don't know what he really

2238.079 --> 2242.2400000000002
believes anymore

2239.92 --> 2244.64
or if he even cares maybe you think

2242.24 --> 2246.56
he'll simply never get to it he's gonna

2244.64 --> 2247.5989999999997
die before he'll ever get the

2246.56 --> 2251.04
opportunity to

2247.599 --> 2257.839
actually go to space maybe it's that i

2251.04 --> 2257.839
don't know man

2260.32 --> 2264.7200000000003
but he really loves his heliocentric

2268.839 --> 2273.52
sayings

2271.119 --> 2276.0
that sayings and terminologies just

2273.52 --> 2280.32
using those specific words

2276.0 --> 2280.32
atmosphere orbits

2281.44 --> 2285.599
like oh signal signal radios satellites

2284.16 --> 2287.839
you know is always

2285.599 --> 2289.3590000000004
never like he never talks about radio

2287.839 --> 2291.68
towers there's always satellites if

2289.359 --> 2293.119
there's some signal going around

2291.68 --> 2294.7999999999997
it's going to be satellites you know

2293.119 --> 2296.8
who's going to talk about radio towers

2294.8 --> 2299.119
even though

2296.8 --> 2302.5600000000004
presuming satellites would be real they

2299.119 --> 2304.1600000000003
still use radio towers of course

2302.56 --> 2307.44
but yeah it's never the rate it's always

2304.16 --> 2310.72
the satellites see and that way

2307.44 --> 2313.28
over emphasize every heliocentric

2310.72 --> 2315.04
science fiction concept grafted into

2313.28 --> 2327.8390000000004
language wherever you can and that's

2315.04 --> 2327.839
what he does

2338.839 --> 2341.839
hmm

2352.48 --> 2357.92
ah oh hasten slowly you're not entirely

2355.28 --> 2361.44
correct there

2357.92 --> 2363.6800000000003
because mathematics is not

2361.44 --> 2365.28
as universal as every as all

2363.68 --> 2367.44
mathematicians would like to

2365.28 --> 2368.48
think it is you know there's many

2367.44 --> 2372.0
conventions

2368.48 --> 2374.48
in math that are only there

2372.0 --> 2377.76
because it has been determined that that

2374.48 --> 2377.76
has to be the result

2380.839 --> 2385.44
okay

2382.079 --> 2387.44
so yeah mathematics too has conventions

2385.44 --> 2389.119
it's not as universal it's not

2387.44 --> 2390.96
absolutely universal

2389.119 --> 2392.1600000000003
there are patterns you know those

2390.96 --> 2394.839
patterns might be

2392.16 --> 2396.0789999999997
universal and we could even reflect that

2394.839 --> 2398.56
in

2396.079 --> 2400.2400000000002
the crystallization of minerals how that

2398.56 --> 2404.48
works the patterns yeah

2400.24 --> 2407.359
patterns are there but all of math

2404.48 --> 2408.56
is not universal there's conventions

2407.359 --> 2410.64
there

2408.56 --> 2412.0
and if nobody's gonna tell you about

2410.64 --> 2414.16
those conventions

2412.0 --> 2415.92
you will not get it you will not be able

2414.16 --> 2421.52
to fix

2415.92 --> 2421.52
the the diagram or or the problem

2423.119 --> 2426.8
have you ever considered that hastings

2436.839 --> 2439.839
slowly

2464.839 --> 2467.839
okay

2470.64 --> 2475.68
this chat slow because everybody's busy

2473.44 --> 2479.359
or this chat slow because it just

2475.68 --> 2482.8799999999997
gives everybody a headache so everybody

2479.359 --> 2482.88
researching what i just said

2487.92 --> 2492.839
it's planet earthing and you want to go

2490.4 --> 2496.56
to space

2492.839 --> 2496.96
okay oh you might try smart shop i think

2496.56 --> 2499.04
that's

2496.96 --> 2501.599
closest you'll ever get to experiencing

2499.04 --> 2505.2799999999997
outer space

2501.599 --> 2508.56
they can probably help you be careful

2505.28 --> 2523.8390000000004
though you don't want to stay in space

2508.56 --> 2523.839
if i if you know what i mean

2534.839 --> 2538.96
oh

2537.04 --> 2541.119
now i just hoped for a response from

2538.96 --> 2543.119
hasten slowly because he did bring up an

2541.119 --> 2545.28
interesting point

2543.119 --> 2547.6800000000003
and i gave an elaborate response to that

2545.28 --> 2550.0
point and i just wondered if he'd had

2547.68 --> 2552.0
taken notice or if he just pasted that

2550.0 --> 2553.119
in my chat and then left immediately or

2552.0 --> 2565.839
something

2553.119 --> 2565.839
i dunno

2576.839 --> 2593.839
sure

2579.04 --> 2593.839
magpies are being very noisy

2598.0 --> 2602.72
better okay yes and slowly thanks for

2600.079 --> 2602.7200000000003
the response

2605.76 --> 2612.1600000000003
different fields same realm common goal

2608.56 --> 2616.0789999999997
to achieve common understanding

2612.16 --> 2619.7599999999998
of no man now

2616.079 --> 2622.8
realm that's it's concepts

2619.76 --> 2622.8
it's the convention

2623.839 --> 2628.64
mathematics parallel to philosophy of

2626.24 --> 2628.64
logic

2632.839 --> 2638.7999999999997
um

2635.76 --> 2638.8
a little maybe

2639.76 --> 2643.599
clearer path within common goal better

2642.64 --> 2647.1189999999997
person

2643.599 --> 2648.56
i disagree math has nothing to do with

2647.119 --> 2653.119
that

2648.56 --> 2653.119
it's better it's just solve

2653.359 --> 2657.839
figure out unravel

2658.0 --> 2664.8
good or bad or concepts that

2662.16 --> 2666.72
yeah it's effective ineffective that's

2664.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
really the only thing

2666.72 --> 2677.839
it's very immoral

2680.319 --> 2683.359
oh okay no no i've never even heard of

2683.04 --> 2685.52
that

2683.359 --> 2687.04
i thought you meant like numerical realm

2685.52 --> 2690.56
or something

2687.04 --> 2692.8
represent idea of true reality and god

2690.56 --> 2692.7999999999997
okay

2694.88 --> 2701.44
i didn't know that had a had a name

2698.56 --> 2702.88
i yeah you it's weird that you would

2701.44 --> 2705.92
have to actually

2702.88 --> 2709.04
give a special word to true reality

2705.92 --> 2712.4
because isn't that like supposed to be

2709.04 --> 2712.4
the main thing anyway

2712.8 --> 2718.7200000000003
have the the non-real realities

2716.4 --> 2719.44
become so predominant that we now have

2718.72 --> 2721.5989999999997
to actually

2719.44 --> 2723.76
point at the thing and say this is

2721.599 --> 2727.3590000000004
actually the real reality

2723.76 --> 2733.8390000000004
that we're now dealing with it's

2727.359 --> 2733.839
kind of sad when you think about it

2734.56 --> 2739.2
okay hasten slowly is meditating okay

2744.839 --> 2747.839
interesting

2758.8 --> 2762.48
existence all that exists

2765.92 --> 2770.56
that's difficult though you know good

2768.48 --> 2772.48
look for me it's like the physical realm

2770.56 --> 2774.4
and there's the spiritual realm

2772.48 --> 2776.079
but the spiritual realm is not really a

2774.4 --> 2781.119
place

2776.079 --> 2784.96
it's more like a reflection

2781.119 --> 2788.48
of an individual of the con it's

2784.96 --> 2790.4
it's so complex

2788.48 --> 2792.56
it's there but it's only there in

2790.4 --> 2795.599
relation to

2792.56 --> 2797.7599999999998
to the spirit like

2795.599 --> 2799.52
i've conceived that if there was no

2797.76 --> 2804.3190000000004
human beings no spirit

2799.52 --> 2804.319
of humans there would be no dark world

2805.76 --> 2810.96
there would be no spirit realm

2808.88 --> 2813.52
it only exists because it's basically

2810.96 --> 2816.56
being carried collectively

2813.52 --> 2819.28
by all the consciousness it's being

2816.56 --> 2822.64
manifested as a side effect

2819.28 --> 2824.0
it's a secondary realm of reflections of

2822.64 --> 2827.04
the material realm

2824.0 --> 2828.64
that's how i see it

2827.04 --> 2831.839
what about the digital realm digital

2828.64 --> 2831.839
realm is not a realm

2831.92 --> 2839.119
digital realm is just scribe it's just

2835.92 --> 2844.88
what digital even means it's just it's

2839.119 --> 2847.92
description so a digital realm is

2844.88 --> 2852.2400000000002
writing code

2847.92 --> 2856.839
meaning that

2852.24 --> 2859.7599999999998
can lead to the generation

2856.839 --> 2862.88
of yeah of

2859.76 --> 2864.7200000000003
what do you call that of apparent

2862.88 --> 2867.76
mediums and

2864.72 --> 2870.839
sensory data that hey

2867.76 --> 2872.079
if properly designed could very much

2870.839 --> 2875.2799999999997
impress

2872.079 --> 2877.92
the experiencer of it of

2875.28 --> 2879.28
that it would be very similar to the

2877.92 --> 2881.359
physical reality

2879.28 --> 2884.559
almost like the spiritual realm has the

2881.359 --> 2884.5589999999997
same similarity

2884.72 --> 2890.0789999999997
to the physical but it's not see

2888.079 --> 2892.4
because that there is no real digital

2890.079 --> 2892.4
realm

2893.44 --> 2900.64
the realm aspect about it is

2896.64 --> 2903.44
the sensory input it generates for us

2900.64 --> 2905.2799999999997
in order to basically make us imagine

2903.44 --> 2908.0
that it's a realm

2905.28 --> 2909.599
it's our imaginations that are being

2908.0 --> 2913.119
stimulated

2909.599 --> 2916.2400000000002
to reify that concept

2913.119 --> 2918.319
on top of the digital

2916.24 --> 2921.359
realm all the codes it's basically all

2918.319 --> 2921.359
just information

2926.839 --> 2929.839
see

2937.44 --> 2945.839
yeah without without the mind

2942.079 --> 2947.119
to basically interpret the sensory data

2945.839 --> 2950.5589999999997
generated

2947.119 --> 2953.359
on top of this digital realm there's no

2950.559 --> 2955.52
way to even conceive

2953.359 --> 2957.7599999999998
that it is a digital realm in the first

2955.52 --> 2961.2
place you know

2957.76 --> 2965.0400000000004
like there were no monitor

2961.2 --> 2967.4399999999996
screens ever

2965.04 --> 2969.52
but yeah or maybe only for program yeah

2967.44 --> 2971.119
would people even realize that it is

2969.52 --> 2974.88
like a digital

2971.119 --> 2978.7200000000003
interface and no it is because

2974.88 --> 2983.2000000000003
of the the information being translated

2978.72 --> 2986.0789999999997
into sensory data for us to take

2983.2 --> 2987.5989999999997
that makes it like a realm that makes it

2986.079 --> 2990.8
real to us

2987.599 --> 2994.559
but it's all just a bunch of electricity

2990.8 --> 2999.04
in in binary code and complex

2994.559 --> 3002.4
encryptions cryptography

2999.04 --> 3004.5589999999997
advanced coding making more detailed

3002.4 --> 3007.359
information possible to be stored and

3004.559 --> 3007.3590000000004
all that see

3010.8 --> 3015.119
aren't we all supposed to be made of

3012.559 --> 3015.119
code no

3015.839 --> 3018.64
made a spirit

3019.839 --> 3026.72
but you could equate

3023.2 --> 3030.16
the concept of the spirit what we are

3026.72 --> 3033.04
and what that does to the electrical

3030.16 --> 3035.68
information that is that basically is

3033.04 --> 3038.5589999999997
the foundation of

3035.68 --> 3041.839
the computers of the digital realm as

3038.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
you call it

3042.079 --> 3047.119
but it's not the same though

3045.44 --> 3049.92
and without the spirit there is no

3047.119 --> 3049.92
digital realm

3050.64 --> 3053.68
it's only a realm to us because there is

3053.2 --> 3056.8799999999997
again

3053.68 --> 3058.8799999999997
sensory data to

3056.88 --> 3061.28
interface with this yeah to make the

3058.88 --> 3061.28
spirit

3061.44 --> 3067.44
yeah equate the experience with the

3064.559 --> 3070.48
actual physical realm in some way

3067.44 --> 3072.88
as a secondary realm

3070.48 --> 3074.88
it is only because of the sensory input

3072.88 --> 3077.2000000000003
you're receiving

3074.88 --> 3080.079
that was generated on top of the other

3077.2 --> 3080.0789999999997
digital coding

3080.839 --> 3083.839
right

3091.119 --> 3098.6400000000003
how do i perceive genetic code

3095.28 --> 3098.6400000000003
did you know that also what

3098.88 --> 3105.92
what how would i i'm not a geneticist

3102.319 --> 3108.16
serceco just as i am not a programmer

3105.92 --> 3110.48
even though i do understand programming

3108.16 --> 3111.359
i'm not a geneticist and i only have a

3110.48 --> 3114.48
pretty rough

3111.359 --> 3118.72
outline understanding of genetics

3114.48 --> 3118.72
i know about epidemiogenetics

3118.8 --> 3124.0
a little it's basically not just the

3121.68 --> 3127.5989999999997
genes it's also like how the genes are

3124.0 --> 3131.359
arranged within within that

3127.599 --> 3134.48
on and off switches outside influences

3131.359 --> 3136.839
generational quick change due to

3134.48 --> 3139.92
epigenetics all that

3136.839 --> 3142.5589999999997
but the rules

3139.92 --> 3145.28
only god really knows the rules and we

3142.559 --> 3145.6800000000003
can try to derive the rules of genetics

3145.28 --> 3149.2000000000003
through

3145.68 --> 3152.24
testing but it look they tried that

3149.2 --> 3153.04
you know the the genome project it

3152.24 --> 3155.839
failed

3153.04 --> 3158.24
miserably and they discovered yeah

3155.839 --> 3160.4
epigenetics and then it's like oh [ __ ]

3158.24 --> 3161.5499999999997
everything is a hundred million times

3160.4 --> 3162.7200000000003
more complicated

3161.55 --> 3164.2400000000002
[Music]

3162.72 --> 3165.9199999999996
something in that direction i don't know

3164.24 --> 3167.5989999999997
maybe it's not 100 million a lot more

3165.92 --> 3169.359
complicated because of this so

3167.599 --> 3170.8
who's to say that's like the final

3169.359 --> 3173.2
complication

3170.8 --> 3173.2000000000003
you know

3175.359 --> 3181.839
look the design of life and genetics is

3179.28 --> 3181.8390000000004
so

3182.4 --> 3187.52
absurdly complex and vast just like

3188.16 --> 3196.319
so why why would you even

3193.68 --> 3196.319
try that

3198.72 --> 3202.7999999999997
but it's good to understand like what

3200.88 --> 3205.2000000000003
influences like okay if this kind of

3202.8 --> 3206.7200000000003
poison happens then this is probably the

3205.2 --> 3209.04
epigenetic effect

3206.72 --> 3210.72
those things are good to know but yeah

3209.04 --> 3212.72
you can also just

3210.72 --> 3214.9599999999996
learn about that through trial and error

3212.72 --> 3216.7999999999997
like oh eat this plan oh you become sick

3214.96 --> 3219.52
okay don't eat that plan anymore and

3216.8 --> 3220.2400000000002
yeah write down how did they become sick

3219.52 --> 3222.8
and all that

3220.24 --> 3224.16
that's kind of how it starts through

3222.8 --> 3227.92
herbology

3224.16 --> 3228.24
hey technically that is kind of the same

3227.92 --> 3231.52
thing

3228.24 --> 3233.9199999999996
except geneticists just get it

3231.52 --> 3235.04
really really really up and close and

3233.92 --> 3238.0
try to

3235.04 --> 3240.72
like get all the complexities out of the

3238.0 --> 3244.319
way to try to super specify

3240.72 --> 3247.1189999999997
specifics right

3244.319 --> 3247.119
that's what they do

3248.48 --> 3253.68
but will that all yield to some kind of

3251.52 --> 3257.52
designers

3253.68 --> 3260.72
utopia where you where you could have

3257.52 --> 3261.28
like the oversight and the grip to just

3260.72 --> 3265.5989999999997
design

3261.28 --> 3268.3190000000004
things from scratch like god right

3265.599 --> 3269.52
it's not hard to think about that and

3268.319 --> 3272.72
then realize like

3269.52 --> 3274.8
maybe that's a little arrogant

3272.72 --> 3276.839
maybe that's not really a good thing

3274.8 --> 3278.48
maybe the bible kind of warned about

3276.839 --> 3282.96
that

3278.48 --> 3282.96
a direct or not so direct way you know

3285.119 --> 3290.0
i i personally just i would rather stick

3287.92 --> 3292.4
to herbology

3290.0 --> 3293.76
you know just learn how nature what's

3292.4 --> 3296.0
already out there what's already been

3293.76 --> 3299.5200000000004
designed just learn how that influence

3296.0 --> 3303.359
influences and improves each other

3299.52 --> 3306.079
you know we i think we got plenty

3303.359 --> 3308.319
plenty of things to learn even there

3306.079 --> 3311.44
even now

3308.319 --> 3311.44
still so much left

3311.839 --> 3317.44
anyway i'm gonna round out the show so

3314.96 --> 3319.2
thanks everyone for coming this went

3317.44 --> 3322.88
