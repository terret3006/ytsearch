it's

83.11 --> 89.84
[Music]

85.84 --> 92.96000000000001
it's a little hazy again up there

89.84 --> 93.84
like yesterday but yeah it didn't turn

92.96 --> 96.24
out into a

93.84 --> 98.159
big cloud bank it kind of faded away at

96.24 --> 100.39999999999999
the night

98.159 --> 102.24000000000001
and it was still kind of cold but it's

100.4 --> 104.88000000000001
like this today and there's just

102.24 --> 107.52
there's almost no wind at all it's so

104.88 --> 110.32
wind still

107.52 --> 114.24
it's pretty interesting and yeah the

110.32 --> 117.119
bright light

114.24 --> 119.03999999999999
it's just this stillness where you can

117.119 --> 121.439
only

119.04 --> 122.47900000000001
kind of hear machines because yeah

121.439 --> 128.319
there's no wind

122.479 --> 130.319
causing any sound it's interesting

128.319 --> 143.83999999999997
it really opens up you send your senses

130.319 --> 143.83999999999997
today like this

145.44 --> 157.84
yeah very calm

168.4 --> 173.28
oh my youtube is delaying enormously

172.239 --> 176.64000000000001
again

173.28 --> 179.519
oh well right let's use in chat i got

176.64 --> 179.51899999999998
green tea with me

181.28 --> 186.0
i'm slightly out of breath oddly enough

183.84 --> 187.76
because i kind of decided to clean that

186.0 --> 190.56
window

187.76 --> 191.44
because it yeah eventually like it gets

190.56 --> 194.72
picks on it

191.44 --> 195.35999999999999
and that's basically bug [ __ ] and yeah i

194.72 --> 197.68
thought

195.36 --> 200.0
it's such a beautiful sight i it to come

197.68 --> 202.4
through clearly

200.0 --> 203.2
for you guys and for myself just looking

202.4 --> 206.239
out

203.2 --> 209.51899999999998
so i clean it up a bit

206.239 --> 211.519
rub on rub off yeah

209.519 --> 213.36
and i did it kind of like five minutes

211.519 --> 215.44
before the show started so i had to

213.36 --> 218.72000000000003
hurry it up a bit

215.44 --> 219.2
right so anyway michael o'rourke was

218.72 --> 222.799
first

219.2 --> 225.04
robin stanley good servant here we go

222.799 --> 229.20000000000002

229.2 --> 234.48

245.28 --> 249.439
two days ago i didn't really address it

248.239 --> 253.04
today

249.439 --> 255.68
didn't think i do i don't know

253.04 --> 269.84
i'll leave it up to you i hope you're

255.68 --> 269.84000000000003
doing well

272.96 --> 279.59999999999997
eric walking what now crisp air walking

276.479 --> 282.32
the property with the dog

279.6 --> 284.40000000000003
oh right right enjoying the chris air

282.32 --> 285.36
walking the property hot you do miss the

284.4 --> 289.75899999999996
comma there

285.36 --> 289.759
but yeah

292.639 --> 298.16
hmm all right robin stanley yeah i well

296.24 --> 300.96000000000004
i had that too with my mother and even

298.16 --> 300.96000000000004
my grandmother

308.84 --> 324.4
right

311.28 --> 327.35999999999996
timing good servant timing

324.4 --> 339.84
yeah safe to say a good servant was not

327.36 --> 339.84000000000003
informed yet

346.56 --> 353.84
read the chat good servant sheesh

359.39 --> 365.44
[Music]

362.96 --> 367.84
right yeah that is a pretty beautiful

365.44 --> 367.84
way to go

368.72 --> 374.24
i guess poetic wait i don't know

371.919 --> 374.24
you know

376.8 --> 380.8
it's better than like situation where

378.88 --> 382.24
like they dumble down the stairs and

380.8 --> 383.199
break their neck or something that's

382.24 --> 386.319
just

383.199 --> 388.96000000000004
because that also happens a lot

386.319 --> 388.96000000000004
fortunately

392.72 --> 396.56
right but that way it's just yeah

401.12 --> 406.479
wow amazing don't worry about it good

405.12 --> 408.56
servant

406.479 --> 410.31899999999996
we know you didn't mean any you just

408.56 --> 413.68
responded to the first sentence

410.319 --> 413.68
don't worry about it we know it

414.08 --> 423.84
that's why i kind of joked about it

415.52 --> 423.84
because timing

429.759 --> 434.8
at least she's lived a long life and

432.88 --> 436.319
from what you've told me over the skype

434.8 --> 439.919
call two days ago

436.319 --> 442.88
a pretty awesome person who was

439.919 --> 444.71999999999997
very strong even in the last phases and

442.88 --> 451.84
that's always just

444.72 --> 451.84000000000003
very inspiring

452.96 --> 457.919
and in a way always a great hope also

456.08 --> 461.919
for the offspring of course

457.919 --> 461.919
because like hey if your mother could

462.0 --> 468.879
make it that far that strong then you

465.44 --> 469.28
probably have that in you too that's how

468.879 --> 479.84000000000003
i

469.28 --> 479.84
like to see that sort of thing

480.479 --> 484.08
that's why i have a lot of great hopes

482.08 --> 487.19899999999996
for my dad

484.08 --> 493.84
we're still around but yeah he's not

487.199 --> 493.84000000000003
not that old yet

494.56 --> 499.199
i think he if i remember correctly he

497.599 --> 501.68
turned like 70

499.199 --> 501.68
this year

503.28 --> 507.44
but he's doing great he's still fit and

505.28 --> 508.23999999999995
hey most importantly kind of like me and

507.44 --> 511.44
even better

508.24 --> 512.719
he's his own doctor and spiritualist as

511.44 --> 516.159
well so

512.719 --> 516.8000000000001
like he has the tools sometimes i still

516.159 --> 521.4399999999999
go to

516.8 --> 524.4799999999999
advice to him because

521.44 --> 527.44
when it comes to in-depth research

524.48 --> 529.6
he's done a lot more than i have i've

527.44 --> 532.8000000000001
done a lot of preliminaries and i

529.6 --> 536.08
i work with conceptions and frameworks

532.8 --> 536.56
and it works out really well it's almost

536.08 --> 540.1600000000001
like

536.56 --> 543.5999999999999
how the science science

540.16 --> 545.76
out there wanted to be except

543.6 --> 548.08
it just went the wrong turn and then

545.76 --> 550.399
stuck to that turn forever

548.08 --> 551.36
well i'm using the same mechanisms

550.399 --> 554.48
except i'm

551.36 --> 558.88
not taking that wrong turn

554.48 --> 577.839
and i've mastered it it's my thing now

558.88 --> 577.8389999999999
hey turret 306 306.

584.24 --> 588.399
right well that that's just awesome i i

587.44 --> 590.5600000000001
wasn't talking about

588.399 --> 592.08
inspiring the next family it's just

590.56 --> 594.0
great to kind of know that your

592.08 --> 597.839
offspring of somebody like that and that

594.0 --> 597.839
you have that potential that that was it

599.12 --> 602.16
not saying that it's great to have

601.2 --> 605.839
family that are

602.16 --> 608.24
obsessed over you or something as

605.839 --> 610.399
father or mother but now you know what i

608.24 --> 610.399
mean

612.8 --> 620.959
right so yeah other than that lots of

617.04 --> 623.92
has happened like

620.959 --> 625.1999999999999
pretty to me shocking developments a

623.92 --> 627.36
steer up

625.2 --> 628.8000000000001
there's a steer up going on and it was

627.36 --> 630.88
quite shocking

628.8 --> 633.4399999999999
it was so shocking that i actually made

630.88 --> 636.24
a full note of it when it happened

633.44 --> 636.8800000000001
it kind of started yesterday well with

636.24 --> 639.92
my show

636.88 --> 642.16
and my show was pretty damn intense

639.92 --> 645.1999999999999
in retrospect i haven't watched it back

642.16 --> 648.079
i was almost frightened to i know it was

645.2 --> 650.24
i know it was intense it's like as it

648.079 --> 652.3199999999999
happens it's the echo is still very

650.24 --> 654.88
strong i put down a lot of energy

652.32 --> 658.0790000000001
pressed very deeply

654.88 --> 662.32
in ways took risks

658.079 --> 665.1999999999999
by wielding that much energy

662.32 --> 667.44
because i am in peaking mode and when

665.2 --> 671.76
you get there it's the top of the hill

667.44 --> 673.6800000000001
and at some point it's gonna go over it

671.76 --> 675.519
and then it's gonna go down and i know

673.68 --> 677.1999999999999
that works every time but i trust

675.519 --> 680.32
there's gonna be

677.2 --> 684.0790000000001
the valleys recently have been very

680.32 --> 686.24
very short and not very steep

684.079 --> 687.3599999999999
and so there will be a hill again it's

686.24 --> 689.44
the

687.36 --> 691.04
the swing of the pendulum that's my

689.44 --> 693.6
approach and i just

691.04 --> 695.04
always careful with the cycle like

693.6 --> 696.5600000000001
you're building that means

695.04 --> 698.48
at some point it's going to build down

696.56 --> 700.0
again and just take that into

698.48 --> 703.36
consideration

700.0 --> 705.279
when gathering more strength like yeah

703.36 --> 706.48
if you overdo it you're gonna stumble i

705.279 --> 708.72
know this now it is

706.48 --> 711.04
it makes me very nervous kind of well

708.72 --> 713.76
i'm not very nervous it's just that it's

711.04 --> 715.279
i'm very alert to it very very very

713.76 --> 719.36
alert because it has caused

715.279 --> 723.279
major disruptions my lack

719.36 --> 723.279
of insight on it in the past

723.76 --> 730.24
right but that was pretty intense then

726.88 --> 730.72
yeah just regularly watched infowars you

730.24 --> 732.9590000000001
know i

730.72 --> 735.0400000000001
i i'll pick up a lot on the david knight

732.959 --> 736.959
show especially because

735.04 --> 739.36
he's been kind of a separatist even

736.959 --> 740.7199999999999
between within infowars and i kind of

739.36 --> 744.0790000000001
appreciated that like

740.72 --> 746.72
he's really trying to put down this i

744.079 --> 749.4399999999999
guess more libertarian

746.72 --> 750.88
conservative type angle to things he's

749.44 --> 753.9200000000001
doing his own thing

750.88 --> 756.56
but i think he has spirit and

753.92 --> 757.5999999999999
yeah i've learned to appreciate that a

756.56 --> 760.2399999999999
little

757.6 --> 761.6800000000001
so yeah i know so like it's musical

760.24 --> 764.16
choices it's just

761.68 --> 765.1999999999999
very consistent in a way in a certain

764.16 --> 767.12
way and i like it

765.2 --> 768.9590000000001
so yeah i've given compliments to him

767.12 --> 772.639
before but this time he

768.959 --> 775.1999999999999
just kind of blew up

772.639 --> 776.8
on his own show at the end going after

775.2 --> 779.9200000000001
steve pacinic

776.8 --> 781.8389999999999
and like it almost felt

779.92 --> 783.279
it kind of reminded me a little bit

781.839 --> 786.48
about uh

783.279 --> 789.279
certain waves where

786.48 --> 791.12
flat earthers would just suddenly start

789.279 --> 793.279
calling each other a shield because they

791.12 --> 795.76
detected some kind of

793.279 --> 797.68
angle to things they would call them a

795.76 --> 800.639
shill and an agent and well

797.68 --> 801.279
he did that he basically said that steve

800.639 --> 804.8
pecinic

801.279 --> 809.279
is a dangerous infiltrate that was

804.8 --> 812.8389999999999
now he is definitely cia and he does

809.279 --> 814.639
he is a manipula it's like his job it's

812.839 --> 816.8000000000001
like

814.639 --> 818.9590000000001
covert guarantees that that's kind of

816.8 --> 823.04
what

818.959 --> 823.68
the the good size whatever the dark side

823.04 --> 826.7199999999999
does it too

823.68 --> 829.3599999999999
it's it's what it is and

826.72 --> 830.9590000000001
dave and i like really exploded on that

829.36 --> 833.279
was quite shocking

830.959 --> 834.56
to see that i don't know if anybody

833.279 --> 836.88
picked up on that

834.56 --> 838.7199999999999
i'm pretty sure that people in infowars

836.88 --> 839.92
land definitely picked up on it and are

838.72 --> 844.399
still thinking about

839.92 --> 847.519
like why because

844.399 --> 852.72
yeah i had like steve

847.519 --> 852.72
is kind of a is a tense guy

852.88 --> 857.199
he's seen a lot of [ __ ] he knows a lot

855.12 --> 858.8
of [ __ ] he has dark connections and has

857.199 --> 862.56
admitted it and he's a careful

858.8 --> 865.3599999999999
he's kind of like a risky wizard

862.56 --> 866.16
in his way so he's already an old guy

865.36 --> 868.24
but he has

866.16 --> 869.279
like his connections are very powerful

868.24 --> 872.88
and potent

869.279 --> 876.399
i don't know where how deep that runs

872.88 --> 879.199
could go all over the place but yeah

876.399 --> 881.68
apparently i read in an article today

879.199 --> 881.68
that he

882.399 --> 886.079
and now i wonder if that is what david

885.6 --> 888.88
knight

886.079 --> 890.2399999999999
was actually so outraged over that he

888.88 --> 893.199
saw like a uh

890.24 --> 893.199
some kind of secret

893.6 --> 898.5600000000001
trick that apparently yeah apparently he

896.399 --> 900.8
has said stephen cena can i miss this

898.56 --> 900.8
that

902.24 --> 907.839
hold on let me read through it make sure

905.199 --> 907.8389999999999
i get it right

908.16 --> 911.6
it was an over insurer and he basically

910.399 --> 917.12
said that they

911.6 --> 917.12
water marked the voting ballots

918.24 --> 922.88
as to trace the fraud of the democrats

921.199 --> 925.199
now that is

922.88 --> 927.4399999999999
that kind of blew my mind it's like whoa

925.199 --> 930.16
that's

927.44 --> 930.8000000000001
i don't have full oversight that that

930.16 --> 934.24
might

930.8 --> 936.16
be a really smart plan and i don't know

934.24 --> 938.5600000000001
how that's gonna work though

936.16 --> 940.48
but yeah i thought it was worthy enough

938.56 --> 943.04
to inform you about this

940.48 --> 945.759
it's like a little alert moment there

943.04 --> 947.8389999999999
are some things happening

945.759 --> 949.1990000000001
and i don't know how well that is spread

947.839 --> 952.48
out

949.199 --> 955.12
so i'm doing it right now don't know

952.48 --> 958.5600000000001
exactly what it all means

955.12 --> 961.279
there's something going on with steve

958.56 --> 961.8389999999999
that's caused the ruckus david knight

961.279 --> 964.399
and there

961.839 --> 966.399
yeah he's apparently said that there's

964.399 --> 969.12
voting ballot

966.399 --> 970.32
watermarks to trace it and that's

969.12 --> 972.399
fascinating

970.32 --> 974.32
because it it might work really well if

972.399 --> 976.079
it was carefully thought through and i'm

974.32 --> 980.24
absolutely certain it was because

976.079 --> 980.6389999999999
yeah it's not an idiot steve is a smart

980.24 --> 985.36
guy

980.639 --> 988.399
smart cookie very careful

985.36 --> 988.399
whatever you think of him

991.36 --> 1001.1990000000001
yes robin stanley i understand that

997.68 --> 1001.68
and i get the same thing that's why i

1001.199 --> 1004.3199999999999
never

1001.68 --> 1006.56
take anything he says kind of

1004.32 --> 1007.6
immediately for granted because he says

1006.56 --> 1011.5999999999999
it

1007.6 --> 1016.0790000000001
but he does inform

1011.6 --> 1018.48
he just evens out the edges

1016.079 --> 1020.4799999999999
leaves certain things out because he

1018.48 --> 1026.0
does have an agenda

1020.48 --> 1029.439
but it seems that that agenda

1026.0 --> 1031.799
from the feel of it is kind of good

1029.439 --> 1034.799
is very focused on long-term

1031.799 --> 1034.799
stabilization

1036.079 --> 1042.1599999999999
but there is a wild flare

1039.36 --> 1042.4799999999998
hidden in there as well he's like open

1042.16 --> 1045.52
like

1042.48 --> 1045.919
this guy is like a in his own way i

1045.52 --> 1048.72
guess

1045.919 --> 1050.0
a natural controller and not necessarily

1048.72 --> 1052.88
evil

1050.0 --> 1055.679
so he will potentially pick wild options

1052.88 --> 1059.679
i think if he thinks he has to

1055.679 --> 1061.919
and basically yeah well or his group

1059.679 --> 1064.72
you know it's probably not just him he's

1061.919 --> 1064.72
kind of like the

1065.84 --> 1070.1599999999999
he's yeah a more core person in a group

1070.48 --> 1075.6
of connections although he i think he

1073.36 --> 1078.9599999999998
does most of the thinking on his own

1075.6 --> 1083.12
because he is yeah he has

1078.96 --> 1086.64
vision capacity anyway

1083.12 --> 1088.6399999999999
interesting guy but yeah he does make me

1086.64 --> 1090.0
feel uneasy sometimes because sometimes

1088.64 --> 1093.039
it seems like he's

1090.0 --> 1095.28
very agitated with people but and again

1093.039 --> 1096.96
i got the same experience in my own way

1095.28 --> 1098.799
i've even explained it

1096.96 --> 1101.28
when you take when you take the steps

1098.799 --> 1103.2
higher you start to see

1101.28 --> 1104.72
what the flaws in other people are and

1103.2 --> 1107.1200000000001
what's preventing them from

1104.72 --> 1109.28
enriching ideal dynamics from the

1107.12 --> 1111.76
perspective that you're in

1109.28 --> 1114.24
and that can agitate you especially if

1111.76 --> 1116.16
you are in an impatient mood

1114.24 --> 1117.44
and i think that is something that

1116.16 --> 1119.679
sometimes shines through

1117.44 --> 1119.679
him

1120.48 --> 1125.1200000000001
because he definitely has feelings i

1123.36 --> 1127.9189999999999
think that he's very controlled but

1125.12 --> 1127.9189999999999
passionate guy

1134.84 --> 1139.36
inside

1137.4 --> 1143.3600000000001
[Music]

1139.36 --> 1143.36
right robin stanley well that's it

1148.32 --> 1154.32
that bird's eye level what do robin

1152.0 --> 1156.96
did you know that steve pachanik is

1154.32 --> 1159.6789999999999
practically blind

1156.96 --> 1159.679
did you know that

1160.96 --> 1164.32
like his eyesight was admittedly pretty

1163.28 --> 1167.52
bad

1164.32 --> 1168.48
like a decade ago he's practically blind

1167.52 --> 1172.0
now

1168.48 --> 1175.28
so it's no hey if you don't

1172.0 --> 1177.28
see with your eyes you're going to see

1175.28 --> 1179.28
with your imagination and if you've

1177.28 --> 1181.36
absorbed plenty through your eyes that

1179.28 --> 1182.16
imagination is going to reflect the

1181.36 --> 1184.559
visual world

1182.16 --> 1186.16
quite accurately if you've just been

1184.559 --> 1188.32
training and training and training your

1186.16 --> 1192.16
entire life

1188.32 --> 1194.0
like this guy definitely is

1192.16 --> 1195.8400000000001
so yeah it's no surprise that he's

1194.0 --> 1199.44
constantly talking from that perspective

1195.84 --> 1199.4399999999998
because it's now his perspective

1205.76 --> 1211.76
exactly here we go again exactly the

1208.48 --> 1221.2
wife has to turn on and off the computer

1211.76 --> 1225.76
and check if everything is set up yeah

1221.2 --> 1228.96
steve petchenick i got a link to his own

1225.76 --> 1228.96
like blog board

1230.96 --> 1235.8400000000001
i'll give you the link

1246.84 --> 1249.84
right

1251.039 --> 1255.52
yeah you're welcome anyway that happened

1253.679 --> 1258.4
thought it was definitely

1255.52 --> 1258.4
noteworthy

1258.559 --> 1265.6
and uh right

1263.12 --> 1266.6399999999999
and also other strange reflections

1265.6 --> 1268.559
because

1266.64 --> 1270.7990000000002
well i started watching a serie i'll

1268.559 --> 1274.08
explain about that later

1270.799 --> 1275.679
but much much later at night like

1274.08 --> 1277.9189999999999
right when i wanted to go to bed big

1275.679 --> 1278.48
bear went live again he always does this

1277.919 --> 1280.24
[ __ ]

1278.48 --> 1283.039
and not blaming him of course it's just

1280.24 --> 1284.24
that oh it's so late i gotta go to bed

1283.039 --> 1288.559
and then

1284.24 --> 1288.559
owen benjamin life ah damn it

1289.039 --> 1293.6
and because i gotta know what he's gonna

1290.72 --> 1294.72
say i at least gotta get the gist of it

1293.6 --> 1298.1299999999999
you know

1294.72 --> 1299.6000000000001
it's very tough to just pass that off

1298.13 --> 1302.8400000000001
[Music]

1299.6 --> 1305.76
right anyway he went on a full

1302.84 --> 1310.8799999999999
trunk trump slaughterhouse

1305.76 --> 1314.4
holy [ __ ] another

1310.88 --> 1316.96
another twist see the

1314.4 --> 1318.96
yesterday was full of twists for me

1316.96 --> 1321.8400000000001
incredible

1318.96 --> 1323.8400000000001
so yeah of course benjamin has given

1321.84 --> 1326.48
logical criticism on

1323.84 --> 1327.6789999999999
trunk in many ways and he's basically

1326.48 --> 1330.08
held on through

1327.679 --> 1332.4
like that he appreciates his skill and

1330.08 --> 1336.3999999999999
is as a comedian too

1332.4 --> 1341.76
but yeah he really basically got

1336.4 --> 1341.76
pissy a pissy got pissed off at trunks

1342.0 --> 1348.48
cockiness it was

1345.12 --> 1349.6789999999999
it was funny but also like in a way

1348.48 --> 1351.6
serious at the same time he was

1349.679 --> 1354.96
basically saying yeah

1351.6 --> 1359.28
this guy is like

1354.96 --> 1362.159
the most democratic democrat

1359.28 --> 1363.28
possible he's constantly talking to

1362.159 --> 1366.7990000000002
blacks putting them

1363.28 --> 1368.32
on stages so he said it it was probably

1366.799 --> 1369.76
part of the joke too but it was pretty

1368.32 --> 1371.12
shocking just to hear him say it

1369.76 --> 1372.72
nevertheless

1371.12 --> 1375.36
like yeah he's just putting the black

1372.72 --> 1378.08
man on the stage

1375.36 --> 1378.08
little pump

1378.48 --> 1383.3600000000001
for yeah so your daughters will fall in

1382.08 --> 1386.6399999999999
love with him

1383.36 --> 1390.4799999999998
it's that's like pretty

1386.64 --> 1393.6000000000001
heavy right wing thinking i guess

1390.48 --> 1395.52
but hey i have started to take

1393.6 --> 1398.24
some notice that there is it's kind of

1395.52 --> 1402.0
this freaky consistency how he does

1398.24 --> 1403.76
really do that in a way like effectively

1402.0 --> 1405.679
like when you say it like that like he

1403.76 --> 1409.12
did it's crazy it's like

1405.679 --> 1409.76
shocking it's extreme conspiracy nutty

1409.12 --> 1412.9599999999998
but then

1409.76 --> 1414.0
you just look and then it's like holy

1412.96 --> 1417.52
[ __ ]

1414.0 --> 1421.12
it doesn't make any sense but it

1417.52 --> 1425.12
almost seems like that's right

1421.12 --> 1430.0
very freaky owen benjamin did it again

1425.12 --> 1432.799
as far as i'm concerned and yeah

1430.0 --> 1435.36
i've had problems with trump as well

1432.799 --> 1438.24
i've called him out for being a marxist

1435.36 --> 1438.24
sympathizer

1438.559 --> 1442.6399999999999
because i guess he understands that

1441.919 --> 1445.8400000000001
people see

1442.64 --> 1449.3600000000001
it as a threat but he doesn't seem to be

1445.84 --> 1451.6
taking it as the actual threat of

1449.36 --> 1452.6399999999999
a whole group of people that have gone

1451.6 --> 1456.08
insane

1452.64 --> 1458.7990000000002
he doesn't really

1456.08 --> 1461.1999999999998
understand how serious this is going to

1458.799 --> 1464.96
get on the long run

1461.2 --> 1467.3600000000001
as far as he's showing

1464.96 --> 1468.64
and i'm worried about that and yeah he

1467.36 --> 1470.7199999999998
gets many things

1468.64 --> 1471.679
wrong he does a lot right and then he

1470.72 --> 1474.0
does things like

1471.679 --> 1476.0
blatantly in the face of everybody

1474.0 --> 1478.08
that's just gonna go like okay drunk you

1476.0 --> 1479.2
made a mistake or whatever or he doesn't

1478.08 --> 1482.1589999999999
mean it or

1479.2 --> 1484.0
they try to justify things that he does

1482.159 --> 1488.3200000000002
because he still did some good i

1484.0 --> 1491.279
in my own way do it too but

1488.32 --> 1494.0
at some point it's no longer testing the

1491.279 --> 1497.039
waters it's no longer trying to maneuver

1494.0 --> 1501.36
through at some point he's doing it

1497.039 --> 1505.84
because he actually stands behind it

1501.36 --> 1505.84
and that's the worrying part

1506.559 --> 1510.24
when is he gonna stop cocking when is he

1508.48 --> 1513.2
gonna stop virtue signaling to the

1510.24 --> 1517.679
marxist and to the the maniacs

1513.2 --> 1517.679
or is he like owen benjamin says

1518.159 --> 1521.44
a [ __ ] a gay

1521.52 --> 1528.32
well in this yeah i don't like to say

1524.08 --> 1529.36
that melania is a [ __ ] too i very

1528.32 --> 1533.4399999999998
shocking to hear i

1529.36 --> 1536.24
actually think she's beautiful

1533.44 --> 1537.3600000000001
but it's none of my business it's not my

1536.24 --> 1541.1200000000001
wife

1537.36 --> 1544.4799999999998
i don't really see it but

1541.12 --> 1545.36
yeah weirder things could turn out to be

1544.48 --> 1547.76
true

1545.36 --> 1548.3999999999999
you know with these government related

1547.76 --> 1551.039
groups

1548.4 --> 1551.76
there there's some really freaky [ __ ]

1551.039 --> 1555.12
they do

1551.76 --> 1556.96
so but it's yeah it's

1555.12 --> 1558.1589999999999
it's no use dwelling on that in my

1556.96 --> 1563.52
opinion

1558.159 --> 1563.5200000000002
but damn heavy stuff

1564.4 --> 1570.0
to me but yeah he did say

1568.48 --> 1572.559
it's basically a sacred cow

1570.0 --> 1576.4
slaughterhouse he had to do it

1572.559 --> 1579.2
and that seemed absolutely legitimate

1576.4 --> 1581.3600000000001
but yeah what do we do now that's that's

1579.2 --> 1584.24
kind of the big question isn't it

1581.36 --> 1586.6399999999999
what's gonna form now yes start over

1584.24 --> 1590.08
what's gonna form now

1586.64 --> 1590.0800000000002
is there a consistent

1591.84 --> 1598.32
right wing left wing

1595.039 --> 1602.24
middle ground

1598.32 --> 1604.8799999999999
natural civil consensus possible

1602.24 --> 1607.52
in a splinter group against the demonic

1604.88 --> 1610.72
destroyers that'll corrupt everything

1607.52 --> 1612.8799999999999
they touch is this possible are we

1610.72 --> 1614.88
strong enough all of us to actually work

1612.88 --> 1618.4
together

1614.88 --> 1621.919
and really get this

1618.4 --> 1626.96
done not through the inside

1621.919 --> 1629.1200000000001
but by literally supplanting it

1626.96 --> 1630.24
is that an option is there an option

1629.12 --> 1633.12
left

1630.24 --> 1633.1200000000001
because all these

1634.64 --> 1640.7990000000002
these hierarchical systems and these

1637.799 --> 1642.799
organizations and the globalists and

1640.799 --> 1644.8799999999999
everything that surrounds it it's just

1642.799 --> 1648.559
incanable

1644.88 --> 1652.8400000000001
they are demonically possessed

1648.559 --> 1655.6789999999999
with control and

1652.84 --> 1659.12
they they're not receding they're

1655.679 --> 1662.0
not letting it go they're not doing that

1659.12 --> 1662.799
they're only pushing it they can't they

1662.0 --> 1665.919
seem to be

1662.799 --> 1669.76
deemed demonically spelled bound

1665.919 --> 1673.6000000000001
to hang on to this no matter what

1669.76 --> 1673.6
it's the biggest mistake of their lives

1675.039 --> 1677.76
and yeah

1678.799 --> 1682.799
if we ever want to imagine that at some

1682.159 --> 1684.48
point

1682.799 --> 1686.799
there will be a world that's kind of

1684.48 --> 1692.08
like decentralized sensible and just

1686.799 --> 1692.08
human and calm and fun-loving

1694.84 --> 1702.6399999999999
then this has got to end

1698.88 --> 1705.3600000000001
this show this side show

1702.64 --> 1707.2
this stage show of politics and

1705.36 --> 1711.6
globalism and

1707.2 --> 1715.919
and the media it's got to end

1711.6 --> 1715.9189999999999
otherwise there will be no peace

1716.559 --> 1719.9189999999999
for free humanity

1722.72 --> 1726.32
they will just move to the next ground

1725.679 --> 1728.88
start

1726.32 --> 1730.399
poking at three people that have split

1728.88 --> 1731.919
off that have went away and then they'll

1730.399 --> 1734.9599999999998
just invade it again

1731.919 --> 1736.5590000000002
for whatever reason doesn't even have to

1734.96 --> 1739.3600000000001
involve anything that they did

1736.559 --> 1741.12
ever could just be made up at a certain

1739.36 --> 1743.12
point at some point they will just

1741.12 --> 1745.1999999999998
literally make up [ __ ] out of nowhere

1743.12 --> 1747.52
and just attack

1745.2 --> 1750.32
it kind of already happened with yeah

1747.52 --> 1752.32
after 9 11 with iraq

1750.32 --> 1754.559
if you think that that is shocking well

1752.32 --> 1756.72
back then people were outraged

1754.559 --> 1758.08
it still happened but they were outraged

1756.72 --> 1762.559
a lot of them

1758.08 --> 1766.0
well in the future they will do it

1762.559 --> 1769.2
when people are so tired out

1766.0 --> 1771.12
that they can't even respond to it

1769.2 --> 1774.96
anymore

1771.12 --> 1781.84
and that's when the antichrist

1774.96 --> 1781.8400000000001
really starts to wreak havoc

1783.679 --> 1788.88
i'm not saying that this is absolutely

1786.159 --> 1788.88
inevitable

1789.039 --> 1791.44
but there's

1793.039 --> 1796.24
yeah if things are just going to move as

1795.679 --> 1800.0800000000002
they do

1796.24 --> 1803.279
without a way through

1800.08 --> 1803.279
then it will happen

1805.919 --> 1809.8400000000001
people will watch as they are

1809.919 --> 1816.72
group by group sacrificed

1814.0 --> 1818.48
to nonsense and money and keeping the

1816.72 --> 1823.84
economy going and nobody will do

1818.48 --> 1823.84
anything against it

1824.64 --> 1830.64
well that's not something that i uh want

1828.559 --> 1832.8799999999999
to live in between if you know what i

1830.64 --> 1832.88
mean

1834.88 --> 1841.0390000000002
i think that i'd rather this sounds

1838.159 --> 1842.7990000000002
well if it yeah i'd rather be a primary

1841.039 --> 1845.84
target constantly

1842.799 --> 1845.84
than to join that

1846.48 --> 1852.88
and i think that if enough people

1848.559 --> 1852.8799999999999
present themselves as primary targets

1853.12 --> 1857.6
against the beast that

1858.399 --> 1861.6
we can survive it

1862.48 --> 1868.08
but it is really that it has you can't

1865.12 --> 1870.559
go a middle way

1868.08 --> 1872.559
not really you either go with it and you

1870.559 --> 1876.08
do whatever with that position

1872.559 --> 1879.44
or you go against it and then you can

1876.08 --> 1880.32
actually keep building otherwise it's

1879.44 --> 1884.3200000000002
just gonna

1880.32 --> 1884.32
eventually get dragged down anyway

1884.96 --> 1888.559
it's gonna become so convoluted that you

1886.88 --> 1892.88
will not be able to

1888.559 --> 1896.3999999999999
do things from a pure vantage point

1892.88 --> 1899.449
anymore right

1896.4 --> 1899.449
[Music]

1902.48 --> 1910.559
you play an anchor

1907.2 --> 1910.559
a lot of people in chat

1911.039 --> 1921.84
totalmatic wisdom

1923.6 --> 1927.6
i always thought that he had people in

1925.44 --> 1930.3200000000002
his inner circle sabotage yes

1927.6 --> 1930.32
yes he did

1932.399 --> 1938.799
look trump is like has

1935.76 --> 1940.72
unreasonable levels of humility that he

1938.799 --> 1945.76
kind of utilizes he

1940.72 --> 1949.6000000000001
is okay with cocking for diplomacy

1945.76 --> 1953.519
the problem is is he seems to do that

1949.6 --> 1956.399
a lot in the face of things

1953.519 --> 1956.3990000000001
that's not good

1958.32 --> 1964.32
it's almost it reminds me of

1961.44 --> 1965.3600000000001
in family situations like a really good

1964.32 --> 1968.48
dad

1965.36 --> 1970.24
that is afraid to raise his voice

1968.48 --> 1972.64
when somebody actually gets out of

1970.24 --> 1972.64
control

1974.159 --> 1978.3990000000001
instead trumps likes to kind of like

1976.08 --> 1980.96
joke about it to

1978.399 --> 1982.32
bring back some morality so then from

1980.96 --> 1984.88
the vision that they'll get out of it

1982.32 --> 1984.8799999999999
but he's not

1986.24 --> 1990.48
sometimes you really like with a kid you

1988.24 --> 1992.32
gotta snap them out of their mindset

1990.48 --> 1994.799
at least doesn't seem to be doing that

1992.32 --> 1994.799
too much

1996.72 --> 2000.24
but yeah that's trump

2001.84 --> 2005.84
the bull and china shop

2018.159 --> 2033.8400000000001
i don't know is he i don't even know

2020.88 --> 2033.8400000000001
what that means anymore

2034.64 --> 2038.0800000000002
because is he really doing that i know

2036.799 --> 2040.799
he's

2038.08 --> 2042.08
creating a lot of controversy on social

2040.799 --> 2047.84
media

2042.08 --> 2047.84
that's for sure

2052.24 --> 2056.72
but as for yeah the real world

2058.879 --> 2061.839
i don't know

2070.879 --> 2079.2
yes lhc mirror

2074.56 --> 2082.0
yeah look if look the the testing plan

2079.2 --> 2083.7599999999998
was pretty decent i respect that i would

2082.0 --> 2085.2
have probably done that myself it's

2083.76 --> 2088.48
basically test people

2085.2 --> 2090.7999999999997
and then see if they're

2088.48 --> 2092.879
actually going to become part of the

2090.8 --> 2094.96
team with their spirit or if they're

2092.879 --> 2098.72
going to mock up or

2094.96 --> 2102.079
get anti-trump and [ __ ] express that

2098.72 --> 2102.9599999999996
but then you got to get rid of it and it

2102.079 --> 2105.28
seems like

2102.96 --> 2106.7200000000003
trump is testing it but he's just giving

2105.28 --> 2109.8390000000004
these people too much

2106.72 --> 2111.7599999999998
chance it's crazy

2109.839 --> 2114.0789999999997
it's like just leaving them in there

2111.76 --> 2116.7200000000003
instead of just literally marching up to

2114.079 --> 2119.04
them and just saying you're fired

2116.72 --> 2120.72
get the hell out pack your stuff and get

2119.04 --> 2123.839
out and right now

2120.72 --> 2131.839
you know and i think that that is kind

2123.839 --> 2131.839
of what people are missing of him

2132.88 --> 2136.2400000000002
he's just playing it too soft and he's

2135.44 --> 2139.29
dealing with

2136.24 --> 2141.1189999999997
nutty not just crazy people

2139.29 --> 2143.92
[Music]

2141.119 --> 2147.2000000000003
and because he's staying soft they are

2143.92 --> 2147.2000000000003
getting more crazy

2149.28 --> 2154.1600000000003
like a petulant spoiled kid

2152.32 --> 2156.4
yeah if you're gonna be soft to them

2154.16 --> 2158.24
they're just gonna get more demonic

2156.4 --> 2159.44
because they want to get through to you

2158.24 --> 2164.0789999999997
because they want to

2159.44 --> 2167.52
want you to correct them deep inside

2164.079 --> 2169.6800000000003
and no longer conscious that's what that

2167.52 --> 2169.68
is

2171.52 --> 2178.079
or as they say these types of people

2174.56 --> 2180.32
just didn't get proper parenting

2178.079 --> 2187.8390000000004
they were not corrected when they should

2180.32 --> 2187.839
have been

2196.88 --> 2215.839
their citizens

2200.0 --> 2215.839
i i don't know what that means but okay

2229.04 --> 2243.839
yeah robin stanley agreed

2248.21 --> 2257.839
[Music]

2250.64 --> 2257.839
the general population of course

2263.92 --> 2272.48
right ah so yeah that was my uh

2269.2 --> 2274.3999999999996
my address all of that all still a

2272.48 --> 2278.0
little confusing

2274.4 --> 2281.76
def yeah there's no live show

2278.0 --> 2281.76
over at alex jones today

2281.92 --> 2286.32
uh but there will be like on or maybe

2283.76 --> 2288.96
there's gonna be a special thing

2286.32 --> 2290.32
on set it sometimes is on saturday we'll

2288.96 --> 2293.44
see but

2290.32 --> 2296.48
yeah it's a weekend so

2293.44 --> 2299.839
just gonna have to sit on all that and

2296.48 --> 2299.839
see what happens

2313.68 --> 2318.64
yes yes lhc mirror of course is

2316.8 --> 2320.32
trump derangement syndrome a lot of

2318.64 --> 2322.7999999999997
people but it's because of the

2320.32 --> 2326.0
heavy heavy conditioning that they have

2322.8 --> 2328.5600000000004
allowed themselves to get dragged into

2326.0 --> 2329.92
when that started up at the obama era

2328.56 --> 2332.96
the sjw

2329.92 --> 2335.839
[ __ ] and with it was ingrained

2332.96 --> 2335.839
anti-trump

2336.0 --> 2341.28
like that became a default part of the

2339.04 --> 2342.96
whole thing and so conditioned in yeah

2341.28 --> 2344.96
of course even people that don't even

2342.96 --> 2348.4
mean to because they just

2344.96 --> 2350.56
went along to get along in that system

2348.4 --> 2352.48
to get traits of fancy pants and

2350.56 --> 2354.48
lollipops and all that

2352.48 --> 2356.8
they will have the conditioning in them

2354.48 --> 2361.839
because they condition that [ __ ]

2356.8 --> 2361.8390000000004
in you like drill sergeants

2366.839 --> 2372.96
aggressively

2368.96 --> 2374.8
it's unbelievably repulsive

2372.96 --> 2376.48
when i saw that [ __ ] happen during the

2374.8 --> 2379.6800000000003
obama era

2376.48 --> 2382.16
i literally had periods where i was

2379.68 --> 2384.3199999999997
crying in my bed

2382.16 --> 2386.64
because it was so miserable the

2384.32 --> 2389.6800000000003
realization that just

2386.64 --> 2391.5989999999997
thousands and thousands of people out

2389.68 --> 2392.3199999999997
there in my own country and everywhere

2391.599 --> 2395.6800000000003
else were

2392.32 --> 2399.76
getting turned into

2395.68 --> 2402.7999999999997
drone freaks that will that would haunt

2399.76 --> 2406.7200000000003
them the rest of their lives as they

2402.8 --> 2410.079
make other people's lives miserable

2406.72 --> 2412.319
it was so horrific to see that happen i

2410.079 --> 2412.319
like

2416.4 --> 2424.0
it is really what made me

2419.839 --> 2427.2799999999997
determine that marxism

2424.0 --> 2430.319
is yeah i am a

2427.28 --> 2433.52
uh an ark an

2430.319 --> 2436.56
arch enemy to marxism it is

2433.52 --> 2438.48
the most anti-awakening thing that you

2436.56 --> 2442.72
could possibly do it is so

2438.48 --> 2442.72
inhuman it is so disgusting

2443.599 --> 2453.839
only purpose for marxism

2447.119 --> 2453.839
is to be erased from history

2454.37 --> 2457.42
[Music]

2464.839 --> 2467.839
uh

2481.52 --> 2490.48
it is it is marxism is the thing

2486.319 --> 2494.56
it is the ultimate thorn in the eye

2490.48 --> 2497.2
of freedom because of it

2494.56 --> 2498.319
it in itself destroys freedom just by

2497.2 --> 2501.1189999999997
existing

2498.319 --> 2503.599
because freedom allows it and it is

2501.119 --> 2506.319
hellbound to destroy that freedom and

2503.599 --> 2509.6800000000003
replace it with autocracy

2506.319 --> 2511.92
it is what it does it is so evil

2509.68 --> 2511.9199999999996
i

2515.359 --> 2522.16
i get really inquisitorial

2519.68 --> 2523.04
when i think about that and realized

2522.16 --> 2526.72
that if i

2523.04 --> 2531.119
engaged that the world would be [ __ ]

2526.72 --> 2533.4399999999996
but they deserve the worst

2531.119 --> 2534.6400000000003
not talking about the fools that got

2533.44 --> 2537.599
just on the bottom drag

2534.64 --> 2538.319
but the people that actually wield that

2537.599 --> 2542.96
[ __ ] have

2538.319 --> 2542.96
so much evil in them they deserve

2543.119 --> 2551.839
the worst imaginable

2556.24 --> 2565.839
and i can imagine quite a lot

2569.68 --> 2575.359
yeah and i'm talking about

2572.72 --> 2577.4399999999996
towards yourself because attacking

2575.359 --> 2580.0789999999997
another country

2577.44 --> 2582.16
yeah that doesn't work that's something

2580.079 --> 2584.6400000000003
else that's just [ __ ] greed

2582.16 --> 2587.1189999999997
isn't it every time another country is

2584.64 --> 2589.2799999999997
attacked it's just [ __ ] greed

2587.119 --> 2592.2400000000002
it's the only thing it ever is because

2589.28 --> 2595.76
that's not the way you fix marxism

2592.24 --> 2598.72
war only causes more

2595.76 --> 2600.4
mental breaks more vulnerability to

2598.72 --> 2603.52
marxism

2600.4 --> 2606.96
yeah because marxism feeds

2603.52 --> 2610.0
off desperate desperation

2606.96 --> 2611.359
it's what allows that for people to

2610.0 --> 2620.319
surrender to it

2611.359 --> 2624.24
to the devil

2620.319 --> 2624.24
only way to get people out is to

2626.24 --> 2631.04
make it really personal and just

2632.4 --> 2638.48
get through to them somehow and if they

2635.44 --> 2642.2400000000002
reject everyone then they must

2638.48 --> 2644.56
be given the fate that they demand by

2642.24 --> 2649.839
those choices

2644.56 --> 2649.839
and it is the worst

2657.68 --> 2661.52
and getting out will certainly always

2660.64 --> 2664.48
mean

2661.52 --> 2666.88
wearing scars on your mind the rest of

2664.48 --> 2670.72
your life

2666.88 --> 2673.2000000000003
but hey i still think that would be

2670.72 --> 2675.2799999999997
worth it in most cases unless you

2673.2 --> 2677.52
literally have sunk so far in that

2675.28 --> 2679.8390000000004
you yeah but then when you break you

2677.52 --> 2682.64
probably just

2679.839 --> 2683.119
get an aneurysm and die from sheer

2682.64 --> 2691.839
stress

2683.119 --> 2691.839
implosion but

2694.4 --> 2697.359
yeah if you break free from the

2696.0 --> 2699.119
chokehold you still have to find the

2697.359 --> 2702.4
door you have to find

2699.119 --> 2704.88
a viable future for yourself in order to

2702.4 --> 2707.839
truly escape it

2704.88 --> 2711.6800000000003
a future away from the power control

2707.839 --> 2711.68
that's only going to drag you deeper

2713.839 --> 2723.04
because technically marxism only offers

2719.52 --> 2726.56
naive temporary enjoyment and power

2723.04 --> 2730.0
it doesn't offer anything durable

2726.56 --> 2733.2
because it does not allow

2730.0 --> 2736.0
really it officially does not allow

2733.2 --> 2736.56
people to have possessions people are

2736.0 --> 2739.599
all

2736.56 --> 2743.68
mind control slaves that

2739.599 --> 2747.119
is the default position of marxism

2743.68 --> 2751.2
all people are mind control

2747.119 --> 2754.8
slaves that is the default position

2751.2 --> 2758.96
of marxism there's no

2754.8 --> 2763.3590000000004
respect for anything

2758.96 --> 2766.319
only power only power

2763.359 --> 2775.839
has to be destroyed it has to be erased

2766.319 --> 2775.839
from history people

2784.73 --> 2787.829
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2803.839
ah

2815.76 --> 2818.8
right well so mao look the problem is

2818.24 --> 2821.2
also

2818.8 --> 2823.2000000000003
you have to start you know a lot of

2821.2 --> 2824.48
people are get so caught up in the world

2823.2 --> 2826.64
that they kind of forget about

2824.48 --> 2829.28
themselves and the world does present

2826.64 --> 2833.1189999999997
default ways of dealing with everything

2829.28 --> 2833.119
you know it's like this

2833.76 --> 2837.28
a sensible person would make their own

2836.319 --> 2840.079
food

2837.28 --> 2841.8390000000004
they would be their own cook or at least

2840.079 --> 2844.7200000000003
have a very close

2841.839 --> 2845.52
person their wife or their husband or

2844.72 --> 2847.68
mother

2845.52 --> 2849.839
in the family whatever that cooks that

2847.68 --> 2852.72
does it completely from scratch

2849.839 --> 2855.359
because it is so much healthier but the

2852.72 --> 2855.7599999999998
society gives you the option to not do

2855.359 --> 2858.4
it

2855.76 --> 2860.079
and to only live off prefab [ __ ] it's

2858.4 --> 2864.319
very easy

2860.079 --> 2864.319
right it's not good for you though

2870.48 --> 2875.839
and that's it every person needs to

2873.44 --> 2875.839
start

2876.24 --> 2882.24
doing it right but you have to really

2879.599 --> 2886.1600000000003
then build something for yourself and i

2882.24 --> 2888.5589999999997
suggest start small

2886.16 --> 2889.2799999999997
like saying okay i'm gonna get off this

2888.559 --> 2891.76
junk food

2889.28 --> 2892.48
[ __ ] situation and just hang around and

2891.76 --> 2897.76
drinking

2892.48 --> 2897.76
bad alcohol and and just

2898.16 --> 2905.04
let that go as i feel it destroying me

2902.16 --> 2906.72
and taking pieces of my mind away in the

2905.04 --> 2908.4
process because that does happen you

2906.72 --> 2910.5589999999997
know when you go in a lot of drugs and

2908.4 --> 2913.76
elk or [ __ ] even when you're young

2910.559 --> 2914.079
right well not heavily experienced but

2913.76 --> 2917.599
you

2914.079 --> 2918.1600000000003
notice i was very scared of it that's

2917.599 --> 2920.559
why i

2918.16 --> 2922.64
never went too far i was very nervous to

2920.559 --> 2924.8
lose my faculties i was warned about

2922.64 --> 2927.92
that when i was a little kid

2924.8 --> 2929.04
and i took that serious but yeah things

2927.92 --> 2931.6800000000003
like cannabis and

2929.04 --> 2932.5589999999997
beer are very appealing i try to be

2931.68 --> 2934.96
careful

2932.559 --> 2937.599
not too much always that not too much

2934.96 --> 2940.0
it's the biggest lesson

2937.599 --> 2942.0
but yeah when you get out of these

2940.0 --> 2945.28
default situations where

2942.0 --> 2948.079
you just take the bad easy [ __ ]

2945.28 --> 2949.0400000000004
to get along you gotta build with

2948.079 --> 2951.04
yourself

2949.04 --> 2952.079
so you're like oh my god the world's

2951.04 --> 2957.839
going to [ __ ]

2952.079 --> 2957.8390000000004
oh dear well how are your eating habits

2958.559 --> 2965.76
are you eating healthy start

2962.24 --> 2968.16
simple start very very very

2965.76 --> 2969.8390000000004
right in front of your nose that's what

2968.16 --> 2971.5989999999997
you got to do that's what you gotta

2969.839 --> 2973.92
build on

2971.599 --> 2975.6800000000003
because all that [ __ ] way out there what

2973.92 --> 2977.2000000000003
are you gonna do just blabber on just

2975.68 --> 2980.0
like the rest

2977.2 --> 2982.48
with not every faculty available to you

2980.0 --> 2985.2
because you're not eating healthy

2982.48 --> 2985.68
so you don't get that reach in your mind

2985.2 --> 2988.16
well

2985.68 --> 2990.24
maybe you should just eat a little

2988.16 --> 2993.839
healthier take it serious

2990.24 --> 2994.72
don't trust everything on one singular

2993.839 --> 2996.96
other person

2994.72 --> 2998.24
be your own become your own health

2996.96 --> 3000.0
expert read

2998.24 --> 3002.0789999999997
all that stuff that you think is so

3000.0 --> 3005.76
tedious

3002.079 --> 3008.319
learn a way to read it how can you get

3005.76 --> 3010.0
through it and still remember it

3008.319 --> 3011.52
maybe you should make notes maybe you

3010.0 --> 3015.119
should quick read and then

3011.52 --> 3018.24
careful all kinds of try everything

3015.119 --> 3020.319
until you get it until you have this

3018.24 --> 3021.04
foundation even if it's just a little

3020.319 --> 3023.52
bit

3021.04 --> 3024.64
any little bit helps and then when you

3023.52 --> 3026.88
do that

3024.64 --> 3029.2
you start to resonate with other people

3026.88 --> 3031.119
that do that too that have that interest

3029.2 --> 3033.1189999999997
they might help you they might have

3031.119 --> 3034.8
their own developments and insights that

3033.119 --> 3036.7200000000003
you can learn from and then you learn it

3034.8 --> 3038.1600000000003
person to person which is much smoother

3036.72 --> 3039.359
than just something you read off the

3038.16 --> 3042.7999999999997
internet

3039.359 --> 3047.119
that's how it works you start

3042.8 --> 3048.319
small very very small you can't change

3047.119 --> 3051.76
the entire

3048.319 --> 3054.319
world just jumping at it no start

3051.76 --> 3055.5200000000004
at the beginning very very small right

3054.319 --> 3058.72
in front of your nose

3055.52 --> 3058.72
your food habits

3058.8 --> 3064.0
start there then you wake up

3062.079 --> 3065.52
you connect to others with the same

3064.0 --> 3067.68
resonance

3065.52 --> 3069.599
you start to understand the problems

3067.68 --> 3070.5589999999997
that before you couldn't understand as

3069.599 --> 3073.04
much because

3070.559 --> 3075.28
your awakening through clearing up your

3073.04 --> 3078.48
body and good food habits

3075.28 --> 3079.3590000000004
now that's much more sensible now you

3078.48 --> 3083.52
can think

3079.359 --> 3086.24
better about what to do as a next step

3083.52 --> 3087.28
discover the true roots of your talents

3086.24 --> 3089.5989999999997
which you before

3087.28 --> 3091.8390000000004
just didn't seem to be there you didn't

3089.599 --> 3093.2000000000003
have access now suddenly

3091.839 --> 3094.96
you're getting better at this you're

3093.2 --> 3095.7599999999998
getting better at that what can you do

3094.96 --> 3098.319
with that

3095.76 --> 3099.119
and now you're expanding your building

3098.319 --> 3101.2
right

3099.119 --> 3103.44
oh if you keep doing that for 20 years

3101.2 --> 3105.5989999999997
then at 20 years

3103.44 --> 3107.76
you got a business you got a whole bunch

3105.599 --> 3110.1600000000003
of people around you that trust you that

3107.76 --> 3113.599
respect you that'll actually

3110.16 --> 3114.3999999999996
take risks to please you because you're

3113.599 --> 3116.2400000000002
crushing it

3114.4 --> 3117.92
and you got momentum and you're stable

3116.24 --> 3120.72
and you and you get it

3117.92 --> 3121.28
and you have a history of growth

3120.72 --> 3126.16
starting

3121.28 --> 3128.2400000000002
at the beginning that's how it works

3126.16 --> 3129.359
you can't change the whole world by just

3128.24 --> 3131.359
jumping at it

3129.359 --> 3132.5589999999997
you gotta start at the beginning with

3131.359 --> 3135.7599999999998
the foundation

3132.559 --> 3138.8
and the foundation always

3135.76 --> 3141.2000000000003
really begins with your food habits

3138.8 --> 3144.0
and there's a lot to learn so that is my

3141.2 --> 3144.0
recommendation

3149.2 --> 3154.48
ah that was good good to put that out

3161.44 --> 3166.0
well there you go embol i wish someone

3164.24 --> 3169.839
would cook for me

3166.0 --> 3172.96
well have you ever considered

3169.839 --> 3175.2799999999997
learning a couple of easy

3172.96 --> 3176.4
you always start easy you know make

3175.28 --> 3180.0
figure out

3176.4 --> 3182.4
healthy easy meals you know meals don't

3180.0 --> 3182.96
necessarily have to be super complicated

3182.4 --> 3185.04
you know

3182.96 --> 3186.48
when you watch at cooking shows and [ __ ]

3185.04 --> 3187.359
yeah you look at these cooks and they're

3186.48 --> 3189.359
like whoa

3187.359 --> 3191.2
this herb and this how you know exactly

3189.359 --> 3194.5589999999997
what to do

3191.2 --> 3194.96
that's not necessary that's just luxury

3194.559 --> 3197.6800000000003
stuff

3194.96 --> 3199.68
that's just showing off for when you're

3197.68 --> 3203.359
really into that right

3199.68 --> 3204.16
no no no good healthy food can be pretty

3203.359 --> 3207.04
simple

3204.16 --> 3209.839
if you know what you're doing that's

3207.04 --> 3210.079
what i typically focus on how can i have

3209.839 --> 3212.7999999999997
a

3210.079 --> 3214.319
simple but healthy meal that has the

3212.8 --> 3223.8390000000004
right things

3214.319 --> 3223.839
and that gives a balance overall

3226.0 --> 3229.04
i've cooked since i was a child all

3228.559 --> 3232.559
right

3229.04 --> 3232.5589999999997
so you just don't like it

3233.119 --> 3238.319
well to be fair i like cooking sometimes

3235.76 --> 3240.88
and sometimes i postpone it for like

3238.319 --> 3243.359
three days because it's like

3240.88 --> 3245.76
i don't want to cook so i'm going for

3243.359 --> 3250.16
something slightly simpler

3245.76 --> 3254.1600000000003
so yeah i get it

3250.16 --> 3254.16
ups and downs it's with everything

3261.04 --> 3264.319
yeah you learned a little cooking in

3262.559 --> 3267.44
this lockdown well that's a good

3264.319 --> 3269.52
see well you got something good out of

3267.44 --> 3269.52
it

3269.92 --> 3275.04
isn't that just awesome right

3275.599 --> 3281.76
anyway i'm gonna round out the show it's

3278.72 --> 3284.799
been pretty intense

3281.76 --> 3286.2400000000002
again i hope there will be some people

3284.799 --> 3289.52
appreciating

3286.24 --> 3290.0
it things that i've said the advice that

3289.52 --> 3292.48
i've given

3290.0 --> 3293.28
it's really heartfelt and i know there

3292.48 --> 3295.76
are

3293.28 --> 3298.48
thousands of people out there that if

3295.76 --> 3300.48
they were just ready for it

3298.48 --> 3302.48
and they'd hear some of these things

3300.48 --> 3305.599
that they would

3302.48 --> 3306.2400000000002
not just have something to latch onto

3305.599 --> 3309.119
but that

3306.24 --> 3310.0
they would catch the spark and truly

3309.119 --> 3314.48
realize

3310.0 --> 3318.0
that they can do it you know

3314.48 --> 3320.88
i really hope so so anyway

3318.0 --> 3321.68
oh damn it's saturday you're right right

3320.88 --> 3324.0
you're right

3321.68 --> 3324.0
thanks

3324.799 --> 3329.04
okay keep going for a little longer

3330.48 --> 3335.839
yeah yeah

3337.44 --> 3342.079
right tell the story

3342.16 --> 3349.839
which story

3351.599 --> 3356.88
was i telling a story i kind of broke

3354.16 --> 3356.8799999999997
the thought now

3360.839 --> 3363.839
sorry

3374.839 --> 3377.839
ah

3380.24 --> 3390.3999999999996
oh right there was some oddity

3384.4 --> 3392.64
i i sure yeah i think

3390.4 --> 3393.52
yeah good servant i shared some of that

3392.64 --> 3397.2
yesterday but

3393.52 --> 3399.04
i might address it was really weird

3397.2 --> 3401.839
there was like a whole bunch of people

3399.04 --> 3401.839
outside there

3402.0 --> 3407.359
but they were standing outside like in a

3403.76 --> 3410.96
big circle and they were very loud

3407.359 --> 3413.119
and yeah they the atmosphere did seem

3410.96 --> 3415.119
tense and not all that great but yeah

3413.119 --> 3416.2400000000002
when i went out there smoking on my

3415.119 --> 3418.0
balcony

3416.24 --> 3419.9199999999996
i could literally make out that they

3418.0 --> 3423.68
were starting to like

3419.92 --> 3425.599
try to make fun of me i guess and

3423.68 --> 3429.2
i was wondering like do these guys

3425.599 --> 3430.88
actually know i have a youtube channel

3429.2 --> 3433.1189999999997
are they making fun of me because of

3430.88 --> 3434.799
that or because they're just bored out

3433.119 --> 3435.599
of their [ __ ] minds and they're just

3434.799 --> 3438.16
gonna point at

3435.599 --> 3439.92
anything and just talk [ __ ] about it i

3438.16 --> 3442.48
wasn't too sure

3439.92 --> 3444.7200000000003
because they were like way over there

3442.48 --> 3444.72
like

3445.76 --> 3454.559
but that was pretty freaky

3448.88 --> 3454.559
not scary but it was like unexpected

3456.16 --> 3461.29
yeah and i'm pretty sure they were all

3459.119 --> 3464.44
brown people by the way

3461.29 --> 3464.44
[Music]

3465.839 --> 3476.0789999999997
but then again it was dark

3474.24 --> 3478.4799999999996
what is my neighborhood like well this

3476.079 --> 3482.079
neighborhood is kind of

3478.48 --> 3485.599
in a part of utrecht where

3482.079 --> 3485.599
there's a lot of residential

3486.4 --> 3493.92
things flat apartments and some just

3489.44 --> 3495.359
houses it's right next to a river and

3493.92 --> 3497.359
yeah it's plenty of green here it's

3495.359 --> 3499.44
pretty nice it's a really good living

3497.359 --> 3502.48
environment

3499.44 --> 3505.52
kind of in between

3502.48 --> 3508.0
suburban and urban

3505.52 --> 3510.0
in a dutch way but i really like it here

3508.0 --> 3513.119
it's it's pleasant it feels

3510.0 --> 3515.359
balanced but yeah there's also

3513.119 --> 3516.319
especially from the center on and

3515.359 --> 3519.5989999999997
there's just

3516.319 --> 3520.88
a lot of weird kind of trashy people

3519.599 --> 3524.4
hanging around and

3520.88 --> 3526.96
like doing drugs and [ __ ]

3524.4 --> 3527.76
and playing like idiotically loud music

3526.96 --> 3531.839
and stuff

3527.76 --> 3531.8390000000004
so those hang around as well

3532.16 --> 3539.5989999999997
but yeah overall they don't

3536.319 --> 3541.599
mock people or [ __ ] like that you know

3539.599 --> 3544.48
that i i've never seen that happen over

3541.599 --> 3548.079
here at least

3544.48 --> 3550.16
so there's no like it is is safe

3548.079 --> 3551.6800000000003
it's safe enough even though there are

3550.16 --> 3554.0
annoying people around that

3551.68 --> 3554.799
are kind of like tedious and try to

3554.0 --> 3556.96
bully

3554.799 --> 3557.839
on the distance and [ __ ] but nothing

3556.96 --> 3562.799
serious

3557.839 --> 3562.799
legal drugs yeah i think so

3565.28 --> 3571.3590000000004
well over here it seems like this

3568.559 --> 3574.2400000000002
what is it nitrous oxide seems to be

3571.359 --> 3574.24
very popular

3575.44 --> 3581.52
but i think they're using all kinds of

3577.28 --> 3581.52
stuff and maybe even illegal drugs

3582.559 --> 3589.44
but it's like as long as they

3586.0 --> 3590.4
don't well start dying on the street all

3589.44 --> 3592.96
of a sudden

3590.4 --> 3594.64
or as long as they don't commit violence

3592.96 --> 3599.44
the police kind of doesn't harass

3594.64 --> 3602.0
them and i think that's sensible

3599.44 --> 3604.64
you know as long as they don't start

3602.0 --> 3607.04
getting insane and violent because of it

3604.64 --> 3609.52
yeah then it should definitely be

3607.04 --> 3609.52
tackled

3609.76 --> 3613.599
but it's kind of like yeah do whatever

3611.92 --> 3615.839
you like as long as you don't bother

3613.599 --> 3615.839
anyone

3616.48 --> 3619.839
and that's kind of the balance

3625.359 --> 3631.7599999999998
well it's pretty quiet over here so now

3629.599 --> 3633.3590000000004
it's only like in the weekends in the

3631.76 --> 3635.0400000000004
evening that it can get a little loud

3633.359 --> 3639.359
because people just hang around

3635.04 --> 3639.359
being noisy in the distance

3639.44 --> 3642.799
but it's not like it's all night long

3641.28 --> 3643.28
you know when it's in the middle of the

3642.799 --> 3645.28
night

3643.28 --> 3646.7200000000003
if they really are loud like at two

3645.28 --> 3650.4
o'clock even in the weekend

3646.72 --> 3651.9199999999996
eventually people will start like

3650.4 --> 3654.799
trying to do something about it or even

3651.92 --> 3654.799
calling the police

3654.839 --> 3657.839
so

3657.92 --> 3661.359
and they do respond you know the police

3660.72 --> 3664.3999999999996
is very

3661.359 --> 3666.0
responsive here it's it makes me feel a

3664.4 --> 3671.839
little weird sometimes but i

3666.0 --> 3671.839
really appreciate the police here so far

3676.799 --> 3680.0
at least the way they've composed

3678.48 --> 3684.079
themselves and have acted

3680.0 --> 3686.24
from the what i could see

3684.079 --> 3687.6800000000003
have not been bothered about not wearing

3686.24 --> 3713.839
a mask or anything

3687.68 --> 3713.839
or that sort of thing you know yeah

3726.64 --> 3728.96
okay

3734.72 --> 3737.9199999999996
all right well mark collard i always

3736.559 --> 3741.6800000000003
thought that the actual

3737.92 --> 3744.64
birthday of jesus was 9 11

3741.68 --> 3744.64
september 11.

3749.44 --> 3756.079
but i don't know if that is

3752.839 --> 3769.52
historically accurate

3756.079 --> 3772.7200000000003
or accepted

3769.52 --> 3774.64
but that's that's what stuck in my mind

3772.72 --> 3776.8799999999997
also because it is kind of like

3774.64 --> 3780.0
outrageous it reflects outrages on what

3776.88 --> 3782.799
they've done with the 911 and everything

3780.0 --> 3783.68
and that kind of makes it make even more

3782.799 --> 3786.0
sense

3783.68 --> 3787.5989999999997
that kind of made it more convincing

3786.0 --> 3789.68
that that was actually

3787.599 --> 3791.2000000000003
that 9 11 might actually be jesus

3789.68 --> 3795.5989999999997
christ's birthday

3791.2 --> 3799.5989999999997
but i haven't done the book

3795.599 --> 3801.28
research maybe it's better to ask paula

3799.599 --> 3805.2000000000003
bible literally she'll probably know

3801.28 --> 3811.8390000000004
that or she'll have more insight on it

3805.2 --> 3811.839
for sure

3811.92 --> 3825.839
right more colored thanks i thought so

3815.44 --> 3825.839
i remember correctly

3827.52 --> 3839.839
jesus of nazareth

3847.839 --> 3855.52
interesting well stasmaret's

3852.0 --> 3857.039
that might be due to another structural

3855.52 --> 3859.0389999999998
approach of the whole thing because

3857.039 --> 3860.7990000000004
there's i've also heard

3859.039 --> 3863.119
lots of rumors that there were actually

3860.799 --> 3866.24
two jesus people

3863.119 --> 3869.839
that have later been kind of

3866.24 --> 3870.3999999999996
mixed up into one so maybe that is the

3869.839 --> 3872.64
other

3870.4 --> 3874.0
jesus's birthday i don't know i'm just

3872.64 --> 3881.839
guess working here

3874.0 --> 3881.839
at this point might have some relation

3906.839 --> 3909.839
so

3920.839 --> 3923.839
okay

3948.839 --> 3951.839
wait

3962.799 --> 3969.37
anyway uh yeah yeah

3965.839 --> 3972.449
we gotta cut down on the silent bricks

3969.37 --> 3972.449
[Music]

3977.76 --> 3984.559
let me try to recompose myself

3981.2 --> 3987.52
oh yeah i remember i actually had some d

3984.559 --> 3989.52
d inspiration yesterday

3987.52 --> 3991.119
i guess that going through the books

3989.52 --> 3995.359
kind of

3991.119 --> 3995.359
gave some old creative energy back

3999.839 --> 4005.7599999999998
i was just thinking of interesting items

4002.88 --> 4007.839
for in the game i do really miss playing

4005.76 --> 4007.8390000000004
it

4010.24 --> 4016.16
or kind of like miss the campaign

4013.28 --> 4016.1600000000003
that i was running

4016.319 --> 4020.319
and still in my head it's like okay so

4019.2 --> 4023.68
if this campaign

4020.319 --> 4026.24
actually completely discontinues

4023.68 --> 4027.52
could i use it as a blueprint to

4026.24 --> 4030.72
literally just

4027.52 --> 4033.0389999999998
write a big fantasy

4030.72 --> 4034.0
story which kind of was the original

4033.039 --> 4037.28
idea to do with

4034.0 --> 4040.24
it anyway i wanted it to be like a

4037.28 --> 4041.6800000000003
a dynamics story based on the

4040.24 --> 4044.799
role-playing sessions with

4041.68 --> 4048.48
their creative input

4044.799 --> 4050.559
as it were and then yeah smoothing it

4048.48 --> 4052.319
out to really make it into a good

4050.559 --> 4055.039
interesting dynamic story

4052.319 --> 4058.16
was kind of the offset experiment i even

4055.039 --> 4059.3590000000004
shared that with the players

4058.16 --> 4061.5989999999997
and well maybe if they're going to

4059.359 --> 4063.44
discontinue i'll just have to write it i

4061.599 --> 4065.52
pretty much have in my mind

4063.44 --> 4066.48
everything i want them to do and i

4065.52 --> 4069.2
already learned

4066.48 --> 4069.92
so many ways as to how those characters

4069.2 --> 4071.7599999999998
are

4069.92 --> 4073.52
through the players how they've

4071.76 --> 4075.039
developed it i can already predict

4073.52 --> 4076.48
exactly what they do

4075.039 --> 4078.0
and i've done that it's like oh this

4076.48 --> 4079.52
player is not there okay i'll take over

4078.0 --> 4081.039
the character

4079.52 --> 4083.839
and know exactly what they're going to

4081.039 --> 4085.3590000000004
do and then everybody's like yeah that's

4083.839 --> 4088.4
exactly what they're going to do

4085.359 --> 4091.0389999999998
because they have been just they're

4088.4 --> 4092.64
blatantly obvious what and how they are

4091.039 --> 4095.039
now

4092.64 --> 4096.3189999999995
so i could literally just take the

4095.039 --> 4098.4800000000005
players out of the loop

4096.319 --> 4100.719
and just continue writing the entire

4098.48 --> 4105.839
story but then i'd be

4100.719 --> 4105.839
basically writing a novel

4109.12 --> 4112.159
i already got 100 pages by the way of

4111.6 --> 4114.2390000000005
this

4112.159 --> 4119.839
just from everything that's happened so

4114.239 --> 4119.839
far over 100 pages

4120.88 --> 4126.96
but it's really a hundred pages of notes

4124.239 --> 4128.879999999999
and eventually i start working some kind

4126.96 --> 4130.96
of story format for it because it was

4128.88 --> 4132.08
also like the report for the players

4130.96 --> 4135.199
what happened last

4132.08 --> 4138.239
time in a

4135.199 --> 4140.0
like in a story form fashion and it

4138.239 --> 4143.678999999999
would reflect exactly like

4140.0 --> 4145.359
note moments noteworthy moments that

4143.679 --> 4147.04
happen

4145.359 --> 4148.4800000000005
so they can read back about it and get

4147.04 --> 4150.4
into the story again

4148.48 --> 4152.959999999999
so i didn't so they didn't have to like

4150.4 --> 4156.3189999999995
take 15 minutes to just like remember

4152.96 --> 4161.52
how everything works again that's why i

4156.319 --> 4163.04
yeah put it down in the open

4161.52 --> 4167.4400000000005
but yeah i've just been wondering like

4163.04 --> 4167.44
could i should i do that could i do that

4169.92 --> 4176.159
i should probably ask the players

4173.199 --> 4177.44
i do have them on discord i could just

4176.159 --> 4179.44
ask him

4177.44 --> 4181.678999999999
but i don't know if i'm also ready to

4179.44 --> 4185.5199999999995
actually start really

4181.679 --> 4188.08
doing that like taking it as a project

4185.52 --> 4188.64
although it would be a lot of fun anyway

4188.08 --> 4191.759
it's gonna

4188.64 --> 4194.88
stay in the back of my mind as an option

4191.759 --> 4196.8
i said i always wanted to write a book i

4194.88 --> 4200.159000000001
tried the cosmog anything

4196.8 --> 4202.56
it kind of disintegrated it just i

4200.159 --> 4205.44
couldn't find a

4202.56 --> 4206.080000000001
a solid foundational structure for it i

4205.44 --> 4210.32
couldn't

4206.08 --> 4210.32
i guess i couldn't i'm sorry

4210.719 --> 4214.719
it's i just can't get it out the way

4214.0 --> 4218.0
that i want

4214.719 --> 4221.36
i don't have a view of it

4218.0 --> 4222.239
now with my dnd with that campaign oh my

4221.36 --> 4225.28
god i have

4222.239 --> 4228.32
like 10 years

4225.28 --> 4231.759999999999
like everything that's written down

4228.32 --> 4233.5199999999995
is what's already been done well i've

4231.76 --> 4236.4800000000005
already planned out for like

4233.52 --> 4238.080000000001
three quarters more that size of things

4236.48 --> 4238.48
that's been happening for what's out

4238.08 --> 4240.719
there

4238.48 --> 4242.959999999999
it's like i got plans for like they've

4240.719 --> 4244.719
played technically in two years in game

4242.96 --> 4248.8
time i've got plans for like

4244.719 --> 4249.6
10 years and it's literally even written

4248.8 --> 4252.4800000000005
down

4249.6 --> 4254.159000000001
struck like a storyboard structure like

4252.48 --> 4255.5199999999995
okay this can lead to that and can lead

4254.159 --> 4256.879999999999
to that depending on the up this can

4255.52 --> 4258.400000000001
lead to that can that

4256.88 --> 4259.92
and these are the parties this is how

4258.4 --> 4262.4
they're going to respond this is how

4259.92 --> 4265.52
potentially a revolution can happen here

4262.4 --> 4269.12
where that triggers and then right

4265.52 --> 4272.080000000001
so the works are all there

4269.12 --> 4273.679
like the players the board is set in how

4272.08 --> 4275.76
it's going to unroll

4273.679 --> 4277.12
now it's a matter of letting it unroll

4275.76 --> 4280.8
now the players already did

4277.12 --> 4280.8
that for a third of the way

4281.36 --> 4284.799999999999
i don't know if they're ever going to

4283.04 --> 4289.199
finish the rest of the two-thirds

4284.8 --> 4292.56
but i could do it i have the characters

4289.199 --> 4294.879999999999
i know who they are i can potentially

4292.56 --> 4296.719
get give them a purposeful continuation

4294.88 --> 4299.52
of the story that even the players who

4296.719 --> 4303.84
designed those characters might agree to

4299.52 --> 4308.159000000001
maybe not fully so maybe this is a

4303.84 --> 4308.159000000001
thing that i'm gonna do i don't know

4312.08 --> 4317.5199999999995
i don't know if any of you care but

4315.12 --> 4319.76
yeah d and d i've written a book about

4317.52 --> 4322.159000000001
it it's

4319.76 --> 4323.1990000000005
it's something that i've always given me

4322.159 --> 4326.239
a lot of

4323.199 --> 4330.719
head room to utilize

4326.239 --> 4332.4
my planning insight and acting

4330.719 --> 4334.4
and just social engineering just

4332.4 --> 4337.199
understanding socializing in ways that

4334.4 --> 4337.199
helped me a lot

4341.04 --> 4347.28
ah be bold

4345.04 --> 4348.719
oh it's as i said i already got a

4347.28 --> 4353.5199999999995
hundred pages of

4348.719 --> 4355.28
notes it would basically be a matter of

4353.52 --> 4357.360000000001
looking through them and then

4355.28 --> 4360.48
immediately having inspiration like this

4357.36 --> 4362.96
is how i'm gonna say that part

4360.48 --> 4364.239
and then i can basically rewrite the

4362.96 --> 4367.36
whole thing end up with

4364.239 --> 4370.239
400 pages probably

4367.36 --> 4371.759999999999
and then think okay is this actually the

4370.239 --> 4374.0
story that i thought

4371.76 --> 4375.4400000000005
i wanted to have originally is there

4374.0 --> 4376.159
something missing and then i can

4375.44 --> 4379.599999999999
basically

4376.159 --> 4381.839999999999
engineer in the storyboard

4379.6 --> 4383.76
insert things maybe keep things it's

4381.84 --> 4384.0
kind of like a movie director but it's

4383.76 --> 4387.280000000001
for

4384.0 --> 4387.28
a book in this case

4388.48 --> 4391.919999999999
and because i have so much material to

4390.719 --> 4393.84
work with

4391.92 --> 4396.08
i don't have to be like oh my god i

4393.84 --> 4397.92
don't know what to choose for the next

4396.08 --> 4399.36
thing because maybe it'll ruin

4397.92 --> 4401.36
everything that sort of

4399.36 --> 4403.12
dilemma i'm not gonna have that i got

4401.36 --> 4405.759999999999
the whole story basically

4403.12 --> 4406.96
of already a big chunk of history i have

4405.76 --> 4410.2390000000005
a lot of room

4406.96 --> 4412.64
to really get into it enough to when i

4410.239 --> 4414.879999999999
reach that final part

4412.64 --> 4416.159000000001
i will have no objection or obstacle

4414.88 --> 4419.1990000000005
whatsoever to just

4416.159 --> 4421.12
write the story completely virtual from

4419.199 --> 4427.839999999999
that point on

4421.12 --> 4427.84
hey i got a plan

4432.4 --> 4440.08
like a screenplay yeah i guess i've

4435.6 --> 4443.120000000001
never written a screenplay but

4440.08 --> 4455.84
yeah i've done d d a lot and game

4443.12 --> 4455.84
mastered a lot

4456.56 --> 4463.1990000000005
right so yeah hey if this book is gonna

4460.0 --> 4466.32
happen no doubt

4463.199 --> 4468.08
that at some point if it's yeah if i get

4466.32 --> 4472.48
a goof feeling about it it's going to be

4468.08 --> 4474.88
fantasy based then i will absolutely

4472.48 --> 4476.639999999999
try to publish it or something and then

4474.88 --> 4479.52
yeah

4476.64 --> 4480.159000000001
that would be interesting but i don't

4479.52 --> 4483.84
know

4480.159 --> 4483.839999999999
yeah when

4485.52 --> 4490.080000000001
could very well be that i'm gonna get

4487.36 --> 4492.96
completely caught up into something

4490.08 --> 4494.64
else because it does tend to happen a

4492.96 --> 4496.0
lot of the time

4494.64 --> 4497.679
like oh yeah i'm going to do this now

4496.0 --> 4498.4
and then suddenly bang this happened

4497.679 --> 4500.0
here

4498.4 --> 4502.0
that's exactly what happened the last

4500.0 --> 4505.199
time i tried to write a book

4502.0 --> 4508.239
got two pages and then bang i basically

4505.199 --> 4510.799999999999
sort of like ascended into a new format

4508.239 --> 4513.839999999999
so it's like okay that just now becomes

4510.8 --> 4513.84
completely pointless

4515.6 --> 4520.320000000001
right but that's probably not going to

4518.719 --> 4522.08
happen like that with the dnd book

4520.32 --> 4526.159
because it doesn't really directly

4522.08 --> 4526.159
relate to my cosmogeny project

4526.56 --> 4530.2390000000005
which i take much more serious

4536.84 --> 4539.84
hmm

4541.12 --> 4553.84
nice that's interesting robin stanley

4543.36 --> 4553.839999999999
that's very interesting

4555.36 --> 4567.92
all right more color to enjoy that

4565.86 --> 4571.679
[Music]

4567.92 --> 4571.679
i got some pretty good stuff myself

4574.08 --> 4581.84
i have to be careful with it because

4575.6 --> 4581.84
it's very strong

4583.76 --> 4595.84
if you have the confidence concerning

4586.64 --> 4595.84
what's on mao

4596.32 --> 4598.5599999999995
hmm

4605.52 --> 4609.679
yeah robin sally well you know that's

4608.4 --> 4613.12
exactly what

4609.679 --> 4616.4
d and d is it or

4613.12 --> 4619.5199999999995
more accurately it's exactly

4616.4 --> 4623.599999999999
the way dnd games have been made

4619.52 --> 4626.080000000001
like computer games storyboard multiple

4623.6 --> 4630.159000000001
outcomes but there is like a train

4626.08 --> 4633.36
through it all but it gives off some

4630.159 --> 4633.36
ability to basically

4633.44 --> 4637.36
yeah shape your own identity and with

4636.08 --> 4639.199
consequences

4637.36 --> 4641.599999999999
in this case towards good and evil and

4639.199 --> 4643.839999999999
it really does have an influence in this

4641.6 --> 4646.400000000001
those games it's a lot of detail be

4643.84 --> 4646.400000000001
surprised

4647.44 --> 4651.839999999999
such early games

4654.08 --> 4657.6
but yeah in a real game like what i'm

4656.719 --> 4660.08
planning

4657.6 --> 4661.04
it's absolute dynamics and that is

4660.08 --> 4665.199
basically means

4661.04 --> 4668.0
it's super sandbox super super super

4665.199 --> 4670.08
sandbox where the entire history can

4668.0 --> 4671.199
unfold completely different and i have

4670.08 --> 4674.719
to basically

4671.199 --> 4677.839999999999
figure out how can

4674.719 --> 4679.76
you be a player in the world where it's

4677.84 --> 4681.6
so dynamic

4679.76 --> 4683.84
that literally everything could

4681.6 --> 4686.320000000001
completely change

4683.84 --> 4688.400000000001
if you go another way not just oh now

4686.32 --> 4691.5199999999995
i'm going to just be on this

4688.4 --> 4694.159
playboard that's unique to this trees

4691.52 --> 4695.1990000000005
no no no it's like no the entire [ __ ]

4694.159 --> 4698.08
world is different

4695.199 --> 4699.44
like things really change and then the

4698.08 --> 4701.679
dynamics change

4699.44 --> 4703.44
and then the culture completely change

4701.679 --> 4706.4800000000005
with consequences

4703.44 --> 4709.678999999999
and three options like that

4706.48 --> 4712.239
heavy consequence story based

4709.679 --> 4712.96
options heavy heavy heavy i love that

4712.239 --> 4715.5199999999995
[ __ ]

4712.96 --> 4717.84
it has to be real and not just one good

4715.52 --> 4721.120000000001
story that's going to be the railroad

4717.84 --> 4724.0
no no no i'm a little bit more ambitious

4721.12 --> 4726.719
with any future game project that i have

4724.0 --> 4726.719
planned like that

4727.12 --> 4731.44
and i've utilized that in my in my story

4730.239 --> 4735.678999999999
world

4731.44 --> 4739.44
in this world for the players

4735.679 --> 4740.8
you arrive from oversea in a new world

4739.44 --> 4743.919999999999
that's basically

4740.8 --> 4749.1990000000005
relatively new ground somewhat uneasy

4743.92 --> 4751.28
very comparable to the idea of

4749.199 --> 4752.48
the early stage of the colonization of

4751.28 --> 4756.0
the united states

4752.48 --> 4758.718999999999
the idea roughly but it's not the same

4756.0 --> 4760.159
but it has kind of the same break open

4758.719 --> 4763.199
feel the fresh feel and the

4760.159 --> 4765.839999999999
confrontation and the wildness

4763.199 --> 4767.04
and yeah and things happening in that

4765.84 --> 4769.84
setting

4767.04 --> 4771.28
and literally such things it's the fresh

4769.84 --> 4774.719
creation spring

4771.28 --> 4777.199
of the future of stings

4774.719 --> 4778.0
well if you can have absolute dynamics

4777.199 --> 4781.36
in it where it

4778.0 --> 4784.0
really can change can really

4781.36 --> 4785.599999999999
turn out completely different types of

4784.0 --> 4787.679
end results

4785.6 --> 4788.719
well that is absolutely awesome in a

4787.679 --> 4790.96
game now that's

4788.719 --> 4793.28
like that's not just sandbox and yeah

4790.96 --> 4794.32
you can mill the sandcastle and push it

4793.28 --> 4796.719
over it's like no

4794.32 --> 4799.199
you can literally have a direct

4796.719 --> 4801.04
influence on the entire manifestation of

4799.199 --> 4804.5599999999995
what the world's becoming

4801.04 --> 4807.76
now that's a sandbox but it can

4804.56 --> 4810.4800000000005
only work through story creation

4807.76 --> 4813.12
has to be envisions all the options i

4810.48 --> 4815.678999999999
guess there are some games that sort of

4813.12 --> 4816.719
sort of little do that try to do that i

4815.679 --> 4820.2390000000005
think what's the

4816.719 --> 4821.84
the game series again it's this sci-fi

4820.239 --> 4824.638999999999
game

4821.84 --> 4826.32
very rpg like it was pretty famous

4824.639 --> 4828.08
because of that

4826.32 --> 4833.12
uh what's it called again it's it's a

4828.08 --> 4836.8
while ago

4833.12 --> 4836.8
first person 3d

4839.36 --> 4846.32
not star citizen no absolutely not

4842.96 --> 4849.92
i don't even know what that is

4846.32 --> 4861.84
now it's a little more famous and old

4849.92 --> 4861.84
as in 10 years old

4867.52 --> 4873.1990000000005
it was a three-part game where you would

4870.239 --> 4875.599999999999
basically do diplomacy with aliens

4873.199 --> 4876.5599999999995
get them together and then go after the

4875.6 --> 4878.88
big threat

4876.56 --> 4879.6
very much kind of like the babylon 5

4878.88 --> 4883.36
story

4879.6 --> 4886.400000000001
in ways very it was very famed

4883.36 --> 4890.48
and had pretty damn good graphics too

4886.4 --> 4890.48
no settlers got it

4892.239 --> 4896.799999999999
yeah looks pretty cool that's very cute

4897.76 --> 4903.04
that's not what i'm talking about yes

4899.92 --> 4904.88
it's an mmo no it's not a

4903.04 --> 4908.239
no i don't think i don't know damn it

4904.88 --> 4908.2390000000005
it's a single player thing

4908.8 --> 4912.56
god it was like it was crowned like best

4911.36 --> 4917.839999999999
game of

4912.56 --> 4917.84
several years whatever

4928.639 --> 4933.84
i don't know i don't remember the name

4934.12 --> 4942.719
[Music]

4939.6 --> 4946.08
mass effect [ __ ] sake

4942.719 --> 4947.6
i just had to say games 2010 guess what

4946.08 --> 4949.5199999999995
popped up in the first

4947.6 --> 4951.120000000001
literally the first thing yeah mass

4949.52 --> 4959.84
effect

4951.12 --> 4959.84
that's the one

4960.32 --> 4964.53
i think it's the one right no it has to

4963.04 --> 4966.8
be

4964.53 --> 4970.159
[Music]

4966.8 --> 4972.719
right but what made it cool that

4970.159 --> 4974.0
your choices your diplomatic choices

4972.719 --> 4977.6
would completely

4974.0 --> 4980.56
change the way the story unfolded that

4977.6 --> 4983.120000000001
very specifically that is what was so

4980.56 --> 4984.8
ultra awesome about that game

4983.12 --> 4986.96
because everything else is just cookie

4984.8 --> 4991.04
cutter [ __ ] by now

4986.96 --> 4994.639
that part is [ __ ] awesome and i

4991.04 --> 4995.28
feel i can do that too with what i'm

4994.639 --> 4998.2390000000005
doing

4995.28 --> 5001.199
and don't care if i'm gonna make a game

4998.239 --> 5004.4
like even if that game came out in 2030

5001.199 --> 5008.08
it's not gonna be [ __ ] 3d you get it

5004.4 --> 5009.92
not 3d i don't give a [ __ ] about your 3d

5008.08 --> 5012.719
i don't give a [ __ ] about your first

5009.92 --> 5017.36
person needs

5012.719 --> 5020.8
i don't care it's going to be a top-down

5017.36 --> 5024.48
music voice

5020.8 --> 5028.320000000001
background sounds comf and just

5024.48 --> 5031.36
beautiful sights kind of hand drawn

5028.32 --> 5033.12
designed that's how my game is going to

5031.36 --> 5035.36
be just like the baldur's gate

5033.12 --> 5036.96
series that's the way i want it i don't

5035.36 --> 5040.48
give a [ __ ] about their

5036.96 --> 5043.92
3d needs and all these piles of people

5040.48 --> 5048.959999999999
that need to be handed work

5043.92 --> 5048.96
gives a [ __ ] i just want a good game

5050.719 --> 5054.2390000000005
that's actually good and it's not just

5053.12 --> 5070.48
convoluted

5054.239 --> 5072.959999999999
to hell with all flashy [ __ ] cgi

5070.48 --> 5074.879999999999
yeah and who knows man at some point i

5072.96 --> 5078.4
might even get that option

5074.88 --> 5082.08
i'll just do it just say okay

5078.4 --> 5085.199
here's the game with your flashy 3d

5082.08 --> 5087.28
[ __ ] oh it's so so special so special

5085.199 --> 5089.28
look how special this is yeah yeah that

5087.28 --> 5093.04
fresh that's really nice

5089.28 --> 5096.159
and you have the actual core version

5093.04 --> 5097.6
without also special distraction [ __ ]

5096.159 --> 5099.12
everywhere it's just gonna have good

5097.6 --> 5102.719
music

5099.12 --> 5106.239
simple graphics and just be really good

5102.719 --> 5110.32
really well designed be purely on

5106.239 --> 5112.32
interface on actually fluid on

5110.32 --> 5114.4
not being distracted by the screen by

5112.32 --> 5116.96
but having the ability to completely

5114.4 --> 5117.679
retract your vision almost entirely in

5116.96 --> 5120.719
your head

5117.679 --> 5122.4
in your virtual space as you listen to

5120.719 --> 5125.52
the things

5122.4 --> 5126.0
and then use your fantasy to fill in the

5125.52 --> 5128.2390000000005
blanks

5126.0 --> 5130.56
of the story just like when you read a

5128.239 --> 5131.199
book and that is what makes baldur's

5130.56 --> 5133.84
gate so

5131.199 --> 5136.32
incredibly special and people don't even

5133.84 --> 5137.92
realize that

5136.32 --> 5140.4
because now all the games are oh we're

5137.92 --> 5141.36
so special look at the special special

5140.4 --> 5144.638999999999
graphics oh

5141.36 --> 5146.5599999999995
so details oh you can stare at an hour

5144.639 --> 5148.400000000001
at this one figure

5146.56 --> 5149.92
or you could freaking stop being so

5148.4 --> 5151.599999999999
freaking distracted all the time and

5149.92 --> 5155.84
just play the game

5151.6 --> 5155.84
ah how about that

[Applause]

5166.84 --> 5169.84
right

5170.28 --> 5174.1089999999995
[Music]

5174.239 --> 5178.638999999999
right i'm gonna round out the show i'm

5175.76 --> 5178.639
getting kinda hungry

5178.8 --> 5183.28
so thanks everyone for coming it's been

5181.92 --> 5188.4800000000005
an interesting show

5183.28 --> 5191.12
talked a little about trump situation

5188.48 --> 5192.239
general politics reflecting back on

5191.12 --> 5195.36
yesterday's show

5192.239 --> 5196.879999999999
how to get out how to really build i

5195.36 --> 5199.44
like that part of the show

5196.88 --> 5200.8
how to build you want to change the

5199.44 --> 5202.638999999999
entire world you have to start with

5200.8 --> 5203.92
yourself michael jackson had a song

5202.639 --> 5207.12
about it

5203.92 --> 5209.4400000000005
but yeah it's very easy to pooh-pooh for

5207.12 --> 5212.96
all kinds of reasons however

5209.44 --> 5212.96
if you really understand it

5213.04 --> 5216.96
then you know that is the only way to go

5216.239 --> 5220.5599999999995
you can't

5216.96 --> 5222.639
hold on to things that are out of reach

5220.56 --> 5224.0
because you want to change it when you

5222.639 --> 5227.4400000000005
can't it's that

5224.0 --> 5228.239
simple so i gave that example very proud

5227.44 --> 5230.5599999999995
of it

5228.239 --> 5232.879999999999
talk some games talk some future plans

5230.56 --> 5236.080000000001
for myself what it could be writing sign

5232.88 --> 5236.639
the fantasy story potential computer

5236.08 --> 5239.44
game

5236.639 --> 5242.639
which is going to be late it's not going

5239.44 --> 5244.799999999999
to happen anytime soon i think

5242.639 --> 5246.56
but yeah i've always dreamed that like

5244.8 --> 5248.88
when i was a little kid i said

5246.56 --> 5251.04
i want to make computer games that's

5248.88 --> 5254.8
when i was eight

5251.04 --> 5257.84
and i literally still have the drawings

5254.8 --> 5260.320000000001
where i drew autographic

5257.84 --> 5262.719
game levels for the computer games that

5260.32 --> 5264.88
i really liked i thought i want to make

5262.719 --> 5266.2390000000005
the second or the third version for that

5264.88 --> 5269.28
i was that

5266.239 --> 5272.4
i was that kid really

5269.28 --> 5272.88
really nerdy in retrospect and really

5272.4 --> 5275.44
shy

5272.88 --> 5277.04
and awkward towards other kids and

5275.44 --> 5277.919999999999
that's kind of why i did that because

5277.04 --> 5280.32
it's just like

5277.92 --> 5282.88
i get this i get computer games i get

5280.32 --> 5284.799999999999
the drawings i get the design

5282.88 --> 5288.0
that's something that i did get much

5284.8 --> 5288.0
more than socializing

5288.639 --> 5294.2390000000005
but i think i caught up a lot

5291.92 --> 5296.4800000000005
