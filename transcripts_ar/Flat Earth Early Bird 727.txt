95.04 --> 101.92
it's much drier

100.32 --> 104.32
i don't know it's it's still kind of

101.92 --> 106.159
fresh or cold but it's not

104.32 --> 108.72
really the same type of cold like

106.159 --> 108.72
yesterday

109.6 --> 113.439
and it's a little bit more gray now up

111.6 --> 117.91999999999999
there

113.439 --> 117.91999999999999
no blue spots

120.799 --> 129.84
yeah very typical

123.84 --> 129.84
dutch winter day i guess

130.319 --> 137.2
but yeah no rain in the evening either

134.64 --> 137.2
yesterday

139.04 --> 145.2
hi hello ladies

142.08 --> 147.91000000000003
robin stanley's first and brandm

145.2 --> 149.2
good to see you both

147.91 --> 153.68
[Music]

149.2 --> 158.39999999999998
territ 3006

153.68 --> 158.4
flat ball i got green tea

159.2 --> 164.319
and i got up kind of early today well i

162.16 --> 165.599
tried to get up early today

164.319 --> 168.0
because i sort of had like an

165.599 --> 171.28
appointment with my dad

168.0 --> 174.959
over skype to get some

171.28 --> 174.959
company issues on order

175.84 --> 181.519
yeah it's like my

179.28 --> 182.8
my first attempt to see if i can get

181.519 --> 185.36
anything out of this

182.8 --> 187.28
the company like and how much and how

185.36 --> 188.8
easy is that really

187.28 --> 190.48
because things have become a little bit

188.8 --> 193.04000000000002
more smooth

190.48 --> 193.04
to do it

193.68 --> 198.0
and yeah we're trying to work it out

196.4 --> 199.92000000000002
could be very interesting because

198.0 --> 200.42
at some point i might even just like

199.92 --> 202.23899999999998
have a

200.42 --> 206.72
[Music]

202.239 --> 210.84
like a separate cash card

206.72 --> 212.159
it's pretty interesting to me but uh

210.84 --> 217.28
yeah

212.159 --> 217.28
do our phones spy on us please tell uh

228.879 --> 233.67999999999998
yeah it's like i think the way

232.0 --> 236.08
that's supposed to happen is it

233.68 --> 239.92000000000002
basically picks up on the words

236.08 --> 240.87900000000002
then it kind of like sits on that

239.92 --> 243.439
information

240.879 --> 245.04
until a secret service person that has

243.439 --> 248.159
access to this

245.04 --> 250.4
basically gets into it and takes a look

248.159 --> 252.48
at that data

250.4 --> 255.84
not too sure though if it exactly works

252.48 --> 255.84
like that

258.079 --> 262.24
but yeah they can get look whatever is

261.04 --> 264.8
on your phone

262.24 --> 268.96000000000004
it can be accessed it's just like how

264.8 --> 270.96000000000004
does that access work it's not

268.96 --> 273.19899999999996
or at least it's not supposed to be just

270.96 --> 276.4
readily available for anyone

273.199 --> 279.68
to easily hack into but there are like

276.4 --> 279.67999999999995
built-in back doors

281.12 --> 287.199
specifically for that kind of tracking

284.88 --> 289.52
that i think that's been established for

287.199 --> 289.52000000000004
a while

291.52 --> 297.84
always storing metadata yeah

304.62 --> 307.72
[Music]

315.28 --> 324.0
load samson by the way george sanford

319.12 --> 325.52
good servant

324.0 --> 327.12
so i think i'm gonna be a lot calmer

325.52 --> 329.28
today than it was yesterday and that's

327.12 --> 339.84000000000003
good

329.28 --> 339.84
no anger issues today

340.8 --> 349.12
yeah uh i guess that also by the way

344.72 --> 352.88000000000005
just like getting some financial hope

349.12 --> 354.8
really does help

352.88 --> 356.639
with yeah the paypal donations that have

354.8 --> 359.44
really helped me out guys

356.639 --> 359.919
and from yesterday and the day before

359.44 --> 362.4
and

359.919 --> 363.59999999999997
this also is just like it's still very

362.4 --> 365.28
promising you know it's

363.6 --> 367.199
there's always this outlook that all of

365.28 --> 370.479
it could just all topple

367.199 --> 372.56
instantly at any moment but that was

370.479 --> 373.84
always the case and it probably always

372.56 --> 377.36
will be

373.84 --> 378.63899999999995
but it's doing great right now and still

377.36 --> 382.0
i haven't

378.639 --> 383.28000000000003
basically invested a cent in it from my

382.0 --> 386.319
own money

383.28 --> 386.31899999999996
in a direct sense

386.639 --> 390.72
so yeah i really have nothing to lose

389.759 --> 392.8
from it

390.72 --> 394.08000000000004
except if i could become completely

392.8 --> 397.12
financially dependent

394.08 --> 399.35999999999996
then then it becomes a little bit more

397.12 --> 401.44
complicated

399.36 --> 403.84000000000003
but that's why i'm not really cashing in

401.44 --> 408.319
anything

403.84 --> 410.71999999999997
so far just used everything to reinvest

408.319 --> 410.72
anyway

416.08 --> 423.84
do i take almond milk no

419.28 --> 423.84
not really

430.16 --> 437.84000000000003
god download the obvious covidient

432.96 --> 437.84
software yeah that's just

446.56 --> 453.039
coconut milk uh

449.919 --> 455.28
well i have i i don't it's not really

453.039 --> 458.639
like a staple drink of mine but i do

455.28 --> 458.63899999999995
like it there's some really good

458.72 --> 463.36
coconut milk like drink out there

463.759 --> 467.599
and especially when i still had like the

466.72 --> 470.639
bone broth

467.599 --> 472.87899999999996
formula with the the chocolate

470.639 --> 473.84000000000003
that was a really great combination i

472.879 --> 476.72
love that

473.84 --> 478.08
that was the best it's better than milk

476.72 --> 480.0
i thought

478.08 --> 481.599
and yeah milk is not that great for me

480.0 --> 484.8
anyway so

481.599 --> 486.87899999999996
yeah coconut milk i do like it but it's

484.8 --> 488.96000000000004
not like a regular drink i'd imagine

486.879 --> 491.759
though that if i'd live

488.96 --> 493.599
like in a much warmer country or like

491.759 --> 495.12
california or something that i'd

493.599 --> 498.21999999999997
probably

495.12 --> 499.52
would have the taste for it a lot more

498.22 --> 501.84000000000003
[Music]

499.52 --> 506.08
but in the netherlands yeah i don't know

501.84 --> 508.56
in the summer it can be really nice

506.08 --> 508.56
i don't know

509.25 --> 512.36
[Music]

518.839 --> 521.839
uh

533.36 --> 539.839
taste indian dishes as in from

536.48 --> 548.5600000000001
india i think i have

539.839 --> 551.6
a couple of times

548.56 --> 553.76
it's yeah to be fair at that

551.6 --> 556.24
i was much younger and i watched much

553.76 --> 558.3199999999999
more inflexible with like

556.24 --> 560.9590000000001
my food habits back then so i kind of

558.32 --> 563.36
was like yeah what is that

560.959 --> 565.5999999999999
it's weird it's very very different and

563.36 --> 568.8000000000001
it's like very hot but

565.6 --> 571.519
like not spicy in the way

568.8 --> 573.04
and like not the herbs that i'm used to

571.519 --> 576.24
so

573.04 --> 580.3199999999999
yeah at the time like a really original

576.24 --> 580.32
indian cuisine kind of weirds me out

580.88 --> 586.08
but they do have some interesting things

583.68 --> 586.0799999999999
in there

586.48 --> 592.8000000000001
i don't know what i think of it these

588.399 --> 592.8
days if i'd got like a pure organic

593.279 --> 603.519
type indian meal but i have had like

598.0 --> 606.88
on like festivals even are you vedic

603.519 --> 610.24
vegan meals which i guess

606.88 --> 611.68
are indian in origin and i really did

610.24 --> 615.36
like those

611.68 --> 615.3599999999999
it's i guess a much more basic

615.519 --> 620.16
type of food more more yeah

620.64 --> 626.079
less specialized less specifically

624.48 --> 629.36
indian i guess

626.079 --> 631.12
but i did like that a lot

629.36 --> 632.9590000000001
it was yeah it was good enough to

631.12 --> 635.2
survive on

632.959 --> 636.3199999999999
in the festival because everything else

635.2 --> 639.36
was just

636.32 --> 642.6400000000001
washed and and alcohol and

639.36 --> 645.36
[ __ ] really shitty food and that one

642.64 --> 646.24
that stand with the ayurvedic that was

645.36 --> 648.72
really nice

646.24 --> 651.76
actually even though it wasn't

648.72 --> 651.76
officially organic

652.959 --> 658.16
it was in a time when i was slightly

655.44 --> 659.839
less strict on my diet

658.16 --> 661.76
and you gotta eat something you know at

659.839 --> 664.32
a festival especially if it lasts like

661.76 --> 666.16
four days

664.32 --> 667.6
getting everything from a supermarket

666.16 --> 670.399
somewhere and there work

667.6 --> 672.48
organic supermarkets there it's just so

670.399 --> 675.839
much more of a hassle

672.48 --> 675.839
so anyway

685.2 --> 689.839
hey adamikin

696.16 --> 704.24
rv truth told me like indian breads

701.2 --> 706.1600000000001
i thought you said breeds there uh

704.24 --> 708.24
indian bread i don't know about it i've

706.16 --> 712.16
never i don't think i've ever tasted

708.24 --> 715.2
indian bread like that

712.16 --> 717.8389999999999
or maybe i have and it's i don't know i

715.2 --> 722.1600000000001
didn't notice

717.839 --> 722.1600000000001
right thai food is also very interesting

724.32 --> 727.36
if it's made right

729.76 --> 735.04
my my brother was or maybe still is into

733.44 --> 738.0790000000001
thai food

735.04 --> 743.12
so he used to make like thai

738.079 --> 744.88
peanut soup that was freaking amazing

743.12 --> 746.5600000000001
but that's also because he really know

744.88 --> 748.0
how he knew how to make it right and

746.56 --> 752.2399999999999
spicy enough

748.0 --> 758.16
that was really nice but it can be a big

752.24 --> 760.639
impact on the system

758.16 --> 762.24
especially if you're not used to peppers

760.639 --> 764.72
a lot

762.24 --> 766.399
and he did also sometimes like use

764.72 --> 769.44
madame jeanette's

766.399 --> 772.959
and all that like yeah

769.44 --> 774.399
super extreme hot

772.959 --> 778.399
because i guess that's how it's supposed

774.399 --> 778.399
to be or at least he thought it was

785.2 --> 789.279
indonesian cuisine yeah indonesian is

787.519 --> 791.36
also very interesting

789.279 --> 792.399
and in the netherlands we know a little

791.36 --> 795.6
bit more about that

792.399 --> 798.639
because indonesia used to be a colony

795.6 --> 803.519
and there are like well i come from

798.639 --> 806.88
basically that or through my dad

803.519 --> 810.0
i'm partially indonesian on sixth

806.88 --> 810.72
one eighth i think so the 16th i don't

810.0 --> 813.279
know

810.72 --> 814.8000000000001
just a little but there's like

813.279 --> 818.8
indonesian restaurants

814.8 --> 818.8
and yeah they can be pretty nice

822.399 --> 826.72
i had some rice based meals that i

825.12 --> 830.079
soared off based on

826.72 --> 834.0790000000001
originally indonesian cuisine like that

830.079 --> 836.079
but i heavily adapted it to my own taste

834.079 --> 837.519
so it's not literally like that anymore

836.079 --> 843.8389999999999
but

837.519 --> 843.839
yeah i had my fair share of indonesian

854.839 --> 860.24
hmm

857.519 --> 862.8
right that's interesting flat accord

860.24 --> 866.16
music that might also be

862.8 --> 869.279
because california is hot maybe

866.16 --> 870.959
peppers are just oh

869.279 --> 873.6
that's not entirely true though because

870.959 --> 875.92
indonesian can be freaking insanely hot

873.6 --> 875.9200000000001
as well

876.0 --> 885.839
i don't know then i don't know why

896.079 --> 899.8389999999999
there you go seven

903.839 --> 907.2790000000001
why the [ __ ] do people dislike my shows

906.079 --> 909.519
because i uh

907.279 --> 912.16
because flat earth is in the title and i

909.519 --> 916.639
am adamant and unrepentant

912.16 --> 916.639
and growing and expanding and improving

917.199 --> 924.079
and even toning down my hostility

921.04 --> 926.079
towards my official opponents

924.079 --> 928.7199999999999
because i am that confident that they

926.079 --> 932.6389999999999
have absolutely no chance

928.72 --> 936.9590000000001
to defeat me through reason no chance

932.639 --> 940.72
whatsoever and that is just like

936.959 --> 943.7589999999999
fatally triggering to certain people

940.72 --> 945.36
that like cannot accept just even the

943.759 --> 948.8000000000001
sensation of that

945.36 --> 952.0790000000001
they cannot accept how upfront

948.8 --> 954.0
that basically radiates off my being so

952.079 --> 956.959
they become obsessed

954.0 --> 957.6
by trying to make me look like everybody

956.959 --> 959.279
hates me

957.6 --> 961.12
that's what happens it's been happening

959.279 --> 962.959
for a long time

961.12 --> 964.399
because yeah there's many layers of

962.959 --> 966.0
ballers you know

964.399 --> 969.199
there's the ballers that come here and

966.0 --> 970.88
chat and they're overall pretty awesome

969.199 --> 972.8
and there's the more cheeky ballers a

970.88 --> 974.24
little bit trollish then there's like

972.8 --> 976.3199999999999
the zealot ballers

974.24 --> 978.24
and then there's the shadow ballers the

976.32 --> 979.1990000000001
ones that you rarely really even know

978.24 --> 981.36
who they are

979.199 --> 982.3199999999999
because they only use sock accounts and

981.36 --> 985.839
some of them are

982.32 --> 988.0790000000001
real nasty freaks and there's more of

985.839 --> 991.0400000000001
them than you want to know

988.079 --> 991.68
and they also have made it their life

991.04 --> 994.24
task to

991.68 --> 996.4799999999999
attain power on social media platforms

994.24 --> 1000.639
kind of like sjws some of them

996.48 --> 1004.639
are sjws because there's sjw ballers too

1000.639 --> 1006.72
right not that all sjws are evil

1004.639 --> 1008.839
by the way it's just that when they get

1006.72 --> 1012.8000000000001
really zealous it just becomes

1008.839 --> 1017.2790000000001
insane but

1012.8 --> 1020.079
yeah that's why i think and yeah i heard

1017.279 --> 1021.759
the feelings of many different groups at

1020.079 --> 1024.1599999999999
times and made jokes

1021.759 --> 1026.48
about certain things that some people

1024.16 --> 1029.039
just really cannot take get over that

1026.48 --> 1030.959
even though others might be

1029.039 --> 1032.24
getting it and be perfectly fine and

1030.959 --> 1034.559
yeah those people

1032.24 --> 1037.199
i guess stack up as well so there's just

1034.559 --> 1039.9189999999999
a group of people that just

1037.199 --> 1040.88
they really don't like irwin they're

1039.919 --> 1043.919
like

1040.88 --> 1045.6000000000001
why is this guy still going on a daily

1043.919 --> 1048.5590000000002
show

1045.6 --> 1050.3999999999999
but freaking flat earth in the title and

1048.559 --> 1050.96
sometimes and then they will complain

1050.4 --> 1053.2800000000002
how i

1050.96 --> 1054.96
won't be talking about flat earth even

1053.28 --> 1056.799
though that's really the thing that they

1054.96 --> 1067.3600000000001
don't want me to do

1056.799 --> 1068.8799999999999
it gets like that

1067.36 --> 1070.6399999999999
all right well they love the dream too

1068.88 --> 1075.2
much and i am a

1070.64 --> 1079.1200000000001
dream breaker i break into your dream

1075.2 --> 1080.24
and then i try to send you to a better

1079.12 --> 1084.7199999999998
dream

1080.24 --> 1088.16
more viable into the future wider

1084.72 --> 1090.72
more real uh but yeah a lot of people

1088.16 --> 1092.24
just refuse and then i end up breaking

1090.72 --> 1096.32
that dream and then they're

1092.24 --> 1098.64
really butt hurt and they feel lost

1096.32 --> 1100.6399999999999
because they didn't get out of it they

1098.64 --> 1104.16
don't want to get out of it they just

1100.64 --> 1109.8400000000001
want things to erase in order to make

1104.16 --> 1109.8400000000001
that dream real again

1114.799 --> 1123.2
yeah tear it 306 300

1118.84 --> 1126.24
3006. i'm going to call you terret 3006

1123.2 --> 1128.64
because these two o's is like ah

1126.24 --> 1130.559
you know it's very easy to say like 306

1128.64 --> 1132.88
but because it's two o's it becomes

1130.559 --> 1132.8799999999999
really

1134.64 --> 1138.24
not fluid anyway yeah i'm kind of hungry

1137.36 --> 1141.52
myself

1138.24 --> 1146.0
i had pizza yesterday by the way made

1141.52 --> 1146.0
like a self-made pizza that was awesome

1146.24 --> 1153.919
that's been a like man that's been

1149.679 --> 1153.919
almost a year since i last made that

1156.799 --> 1162.32
yeah but i can't just say tear it

1160.559 --> 1165.84
because that's only half the text in

1162.32 --> 1165.84
your name

1175.12 --> 1183.4399999999998
it's fine your name is what it is

1179.28 --> 1183.44
i'm just trying to figure out ways to

1184.64 --> 1187.76
to name your right

1188.32 --> 1196.0
and keep it fluid

1192.24 --> 1198.24
uh yeah

1196.0 --> 1199.84
yeah pizza was great and i got another

1198.24 --> 1201.84
one so i'm looking forward to this

1199.84 --> 1205.1999999999998
evening getting one again

1201.84 --> 1207.28
so great what they do is like spelt

1205.2 --> 1209.28
bottom pizzas yeah they are pretty fat

1207.28 --> 1210.32
but yeah it's pretty decent also pretty

1209.28 --> 1214.0
damn expensive

1210.32 --> 1215.36
really but you get a lot for it it's

1214.0 --> 1217.76
really a big meal

1215.36 --> 1218.559
because of it it's just the bottom put

1217.76 --> 1221.28
some

1218.559 --> 1223.28
everything organic of course put some

1221.28 --> 1224.0
olive oil over it like rub it out and

1223.28 --> 1228.559
then let it

1224.0 --> 1232.08
soak in put some tomato paste

1228.559 --> 1233.44
it's like tomato concentrate not ketchup

1232.08 --> 1236.0
or anything

1233.44 --> 1236.72
typical for pizza bottoms uh put it over

1236.0 --> 1240.88
that

1236.72 --> 1244.32
then uh drop equalize it

1240.88 --> 1248.0
then drop some freshly cut

1244.32 --> 1250.72
basil from some plants by the way that

1248.0 --> 1253.039
like man these plants were like almost

1250.72 --> 1257.3600000000001
dying they're so

1253.039 --> 1259.039
old and it was pretty incredible because

1257.36 --> 1263.52
some of the basil leaves like

1259.039 --> 1266.72
had droplets of resin

1263.52 --> 1270.08
on it pretty weird but

1266.72 --> 1272.72
my god it's like pure etheric oils

1270.08 --> 1274.559
in there so i used that it was pretty

1272.72 --> 1277.2
remarkable

1274.559 --> 1278.32
just like one little branch with little

1277.2 --> 1282.4
leaves cut that up

1278.32 --> 1284.48
put it over the tomato it was great

1282.4 --> 1286.0
awesome and it's just fascinating that

1284.48 --> 1287.919
yeah when you got fresh basil it's kind

1286.0 --> 1289.52
of juicy and all that it's really nice

1287.919 --> 1293.3600000000001
it tastes you got

1289.52 --> 1296.4
a broader sense broader taste

1293.36 --> 1298.8799999999999
when it gets a little older it gets

1296.4 --> 1300.72
i don't know depends on how you treat it

1298.88 --> 1304.48
but did with these this like

1300.72 --> 1306.24
these droplets of resin like basil

1304.48 --> 1307.6
resin coming off there it's pretty

1306.24 --> 1311.039
interesting and like

1307.6 --> 1314.3999999999999
really the smell is fantastic

1311.039 --> 1319.84
but yeah uh also on that uh

1314.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
what is it again

1322.2 --> 1325.259
[Music]

1327.12 --> 1332.4799999999998
zucchini zucchini

1330.159 --> 1334.0800000000002
i always forget it's the thing that the

1332.48 --> 1337.44
java say

1334.08 --> 1340.72
zucchini yeah zucchini

1337.44 --> 1343.76
little blocks uh

1340.72 --> 1346.88
if i feel like it some

1343.76 --> 1348.799
chili pepper but i didn't do it this

1346.88 --> 1353.7600000000002
time

1348.799 --> 1356.799
and on top of that yeah uh salami

1353.76 --> 1360.0
and on yeah as a final touch

1356.799 --> 1362.6399999999999
some oregano dried

1360.0 --> 1364.64
version i do also have fresh but i don't

1362.64 --> 1367.2800000000002
know

1364.64 --> 1367.919
for like on top i prefer the dried

1367.28 --> 1371.2
otherwise

1367.919 --> 1375.2
like the fresh is just gonna sort of

1371.2 --> 1378.559
like dry and burn up

1375.2 --> 1382.72
and that was absolutely great

1378.559 --> 1384.72
loved it the be right back need food

1382.72 --> 1389.2
yeah yeah

1384.72 --> 1392.24
i'm kind of hungry myself at the moment

1389.2 --> 1394.0800000000002
but i had like a like a thin slice of

1392.24 --> 1396.08
bread to chew on

1394.08 --> 1398.799
to ensure that i wouldn't be hungry the

1396.08 --> 1398.799
entire show

1400.72 --> 1405.679
but now i am really looking forward to

1403.679 --> 1409.3600000000001
that pizza

1405.679 --> 1412.5590000000002
in a few hours hmm

1409.36 --> 1414.6399999999999
because it was just freaking delicious

1412.559 --> 1416.0
and i really like pizzas i've had

1414.64 --> 1418.7990000000002
periods it's kind of

1416.0 --> 1422.24
embarrassing i guess where i ate pizza

1418.799 --> 1424.6399999999999
like every day for like a year

1422.24 --> 1425.679
almost every day and it'd be like yeah

1424.64 --> 1428.24
pizza

1425.679 --> 1429.1200000000001
four five times a week no problem

1428.24 --> 1431.52
whatsoever

1429.12 --> 1433.4399999999998
looking forward to it every single time

1431.52 --> 1436.32
even though i basically make the pizza

1433.44 --> 1436.96
exactly the same way every single time

1436.32 --> 1439.6
like

1436.96 --> 1440.88
hey when i make a meal that i like i

1439.6 --> 1445.6789999999999
don't

1440.88 --> 1448.7990000000002
stop liking it the next time i have it

1445.679 --> 1448.799
it's very handy

1451.919 --> 1460.48
lemonade pizza slices yeah pretty much

1458.0 --> 1461.679
what i do is a very i i am obsessed with

1460.48 --> 1465.1200000000001
patterns

1461.679 --> 1465.52
like in the sense that if there is a way

1465.12 --> 1468.1589999999999
to

1465.52 --> 1470.0
lay things out in patterns on food i

1468.159 --> 1473.919
cannot help but do it

1470.0 --> 1477.44
i have to it's like a mantra

1473.919 --> 1479.44
like to me making a pizza is like making

1477.44 --> 1482.24
the

1479.44 --> 1483.039
what is it the mandala sand circles to

1482.24 --> 1487.84
buddhists

1483.039 --> 1487.84
and that's what making a pizza is to me

1487.919 --> 1494.48
even though i use salami right

1491.679 --> 1495.3600000000001
so i usually end up making like a the

1494.48 --> 1499.3600000000001
pattern of a

1495.36 --> 1503.12
sun with this with salami

1499.36 --> 1504.9599999999998
quarter slices and that always works out

1503.12 --> 1506.4799999999998
because it shrivels up from the heat and

1504.96 --> 1509.679
then like it all fits

1506.48 --> 1514.88
it's interesting i don't know

1509.679 --> 1516.64
interesting neurotic whatever

1514.88 --> 1519.2
what i do know is it's freaking

1516.64 --> 1519.2
delicious

1526.84 --> 1529.84
tortillas

1534.0 --> 1538.64
right yeah yeah is that

1539.36 --> 1546.0
is that like a spanish tretilla

1542.4 --> 1547.919
tortilla i used to like we had that in

1546.0 --> 1550.64
family too we learned that from spanish

1547.919 --> 1552.159
people when we went to vacation in spain

1550.64 --> 1554.24
because there were quite a lot of people

1552.159 --> 1556.5590000000002
especially like guys that weren't

1554.24 --> 1558.88
elaborate cooks that would

1556.559 --> 1562.559
typically lunch with that stuff just a

1558.88 --> 1562.5590000000002
bunch of potatoes a bunch of

1562.64 --> 1570.5590000000002
what is it the stick beans typical

1567.44 --> 1572.48
[ __ ] oh my god it's so frustrating

1570.559 --> 1574.6399999999999
sometimes how freaking different

1572.48 --> 1576.8
dutch names for vegetables are as in

1574.64 --> 1578.24
english

1576.8 --> 1585.84
[Music]

1578.24 --> 1585.84
very confusing at times

1586.32 --> 1590.32
green beans they're literally called

1588.4 --> 1595.2
green beans okay

1590.32 --> 1595.2
right green beans and

1596.799 --> 1602.32
yeah egg oh yeah right also onion rings

1600.88 --> 1605.7600000000002
often

1602.32 --> 1608.48
then you make it mix all that stuff up

1605.76 --> 1608.799
uh with olive oil and then they throw

1608.48 --> 1611.6
the

1608.799 --> 1612.0
the egg over it it's very interesting

1611.6 --> 1615.9189999999999
how they

1612.0 --> 1617.279
do it i sort of know how to do it but i

1615.919 --> 1620.3200000000002
unfortunately always

1617.279 --> 1621.84
end up like having it burned to the pan

1620.32 --> 1624.08
causing the whole thing to become a

1621.84 --> 1625.76
giant mess that happens typically and

1624.08 --> 1627.279
the spaniards kind of know how to

1625.76 --> 1632.48
prevent that

1627.279 --> 1641.76
but yeah tortillas it's been a while

1632.48 --> 1643.44
but it's good easy food

1641.76 --> 1646.48
oh yeah besides green beans you can also

1643.44 --> 1650.3200000000002
easily put carrots in there

1646.48 --> 1650.32
green beans carrots onions

1652.399 --> 1657.76
and egg yeah onion rings right

1655.919 --> 1659.2
yeah sorry everybody i'm making you all

1657.76 --> 1662.799
very hungry i bet

1659.2 --> 1662.799
i'm making myself hungry too

1666.24 --> 1669.76
on the other hand being hungry is a good

1667.919 --> 1672.3990000000001
sign because when you're hungry

1669.76 --> 1674.1589999999999
you're probably not too stressed to be

1672.399 --> 1677.039
hungry

1674.159 --> 1678.3200000000002
every time i get hungry it's always a

1677.039 --> 1681.12
good sign for me

1678.32 --> 1683.2
it's like fairy telling sometimes i call

1681.12 --> 1685.1999999999998
my healer when i'm like all stressed out

1683.2 --> 1686.799
him like i'm worried about why am i so

1685.2 --> 1688.72
angry or something you know

1686.799 --> 1690.6399999999999
call him up and he's like doing his

1688.72 --> 1692.96
thing checking me out

1690.64 --> 1694.3990000000001
i met him yeah esoterically putting me

1692.96 --> 1696.48
back in my body and

1694.399 --> 1697.6789999999999
yeah it's weird to say it like that but

1696.48 --> 1700.559
it works

1697.679 --> 1701.2
and i can feel it it's literally like

1700.559 --> 1704.559
suddenly

1701.2 --> 1705.679
i enter my body again fully it literally

1704.559 --> 1709.279
feels it's

1705.679 --> 1712.48
this weird world man weird

1709.279 --> 1713.44
but it's there and then after that

1712.48 --> 1716.559
happens

1713.44 --> 1717.919
the first sign is like oh you're back in

1716.559 --> 1721.6789999999999
your body again okay

1717.919 --> 1722.7990000000002
right hungry it's like the stress goes

1721.679 --> 1726.159
away i

1722.799 --> 1728.96
i enter or enter i completely integrate

1726.159 --> 1733.1200000000001
with my body again and immediately okay

1728.96 --> 1736.8400000000001
hungry very normal response for me

1733.12 --> 1739.84
so being hungry for me is usually a good

1736.84 --> 1739.84
sign

1741.36 --> 1744.8799999999999
so i'll take it as such

1748.88 --> 1757.6000000000001
breakfast burritos two pounds

1752.72 --> 1760.88
holy [ __ ] dude those are some burritos

1757.6 --> 1760.8799999999999
sounds really nice though

1763.679 --> 1768.24
i've made some interesting burritos

1765.44 --> 1770.72
myself what i what i always do when i do

1768.24 --> 1773.52
it's basically i take chili con carne

1770.72 --> 1776.88
these days without the carne

1773.52 --> 1777.6
make it and then just basically it's

1776.88 --> 1781.3600000000001
already

1777.6 --> 1784.399
it's not very soupish it's very thick

1781.36 --> 1785.279
and fatty and just take a scoop put it

1784.399 --> 1789.1999999999998
in the burrito

1785.279 --> 1789.2
and then heat that up in the microwave

1789.36 --> 1795.84
great okay now i'm just making everybody

1792.24 --> 1795.84
even more hungry probably

1802.08 --> 1811.12
refried beans are the best

1808.799 --> 1811.12
right

1813.84 --> 1818.9599999999998
yeah and it's

1817.039 --> 1820.24
funny now that i think about it and then

1818.96 --> 1824.159
i'm also thinking back

1820.24 --> 1826.48
about going to spain with my family

1824.159 --> 1829.44
learning about the cooking of yeah

1826.48 --> 1831.279
spanish people italian people

1829.44 --> 1833.279
i think even portuguese at some point

1831.279 --> 1835.2
i'm not sure

1833.279 --> 1836.399
i think yeah there were like it was a

1835.2 --> 1839.52
mediterranean

1836.399 --> 1840.8799999999999
get-together with us the weird dutch

1839.52 --> 1843.52
people

1840.88 --> 1844.0800000000002
because we were kind of hippies at least

1843.52 --> 1847.279
yeah

1844.08 --> 1848.72
we were right uh not super super

1847.279 --> 1851.44
hippy-dippy but just

1848.72 --> 1853.84
enough to recognize yeah those are dutch

1851.44 --> 1853.8400000000001
hippies

1854.88 --> 1860.96
but yeah they it was very much like this

1858.32 --> 1862.72
it's just like except it's in the real

1860.96 --> 1864.96
physical world and not a chat

1862.72 --> 1866.0
we came together not in a chat room but

1864.96 --> 1868.88
at a camping

1866.0 --> 1870.159
like a camping in a pine forest amazing

1868.88 --> 1872.64
place

1870.159 --> 1873.8400000000001
the air in the morning literally you

1872.64 --> 1875.7800000000002
wake up in a tent

1873.84 --> 1877.12
in a pine forest

1875.78 --> 1880.799
[Music]

1877.12 --> 1881.279
good stuff unless a big spider crawls in

1880.799 --> 1885.279
your tent

1881.279 --> 1888.48
so you got to be sure take care of that

1885.279 --> 1890.32
right but

1888.48 --> 1892.159
yeah we did that constantly just come

1890.32 --> 1894.08
together and then in the evening

1892.159 --> 1895.44
it'll be like yeah yeah okay everybody

1894.08 --> 1898.6399999999999
make a meal

1895.44 --> 1900.3990000000001
and then huge row of tables put together

1898.64 --> 1901.1200000000001
from everybody's table so there will be

1900.399 --> 1903.9189999999999
like

1901.12 --> 1907.36
eight to ten families just sitting

1903.919 --> 1909.76
around a giant giant long table

1907.36 --> 1911.1999999999998
and then everybody having made their own

1909.76 --> 1913.2
meal and it's like oh

1911.2 --> 1914.48
what is this what is that what is that

1913.2 --> 1916.0800000000002
and some people are like oh that looks

1914.48 --> 1916.64
too creepy for me i don't want to try

1916.08 --> 1918.96
that and

1916.64 --> 1920.3200000000002
then but there's always something that's

1918.96 --> 1923.44
good for them

1920.32 --> 1926.799
it was a real feast experience

1923.44 --> 1927.2
and it almost say wouldn't that be great

1926.799 --> 1930.32
to

1927.2 --> 1930.32
sort of do that

1930.64 --> 1936.159
with us flat earthers at some point try

1933.76 --> 1936.1589999999999
it out

1936.399 --> 1943.4399999999998
like we got the the meetups

1940.399 --> 1946.4799999999998
and the the lectures and all that

1943.44 --> 1951.039
but yeah

1946.48 --> 1954.159
how about like a a cook-off

1951.039 --> 1957.6
celebration come together or something

1954.159 --> 1959.3600000000001
isn't that interesting it's also

1957.6 --> 1960.08
interesting because i just know for a

1959.36 --> 1962.32
fact that

1960.08 --> 1964.72
so many flat earthers are naturally

1962.32 --> 1966.72
interested in cooking and eating because

1964.72 --> 1968.48
they are interested in their health it's

1966.72 --> 1970.0
part of the reason they got drawn into

1968.48 --> 1973.3600000000001
this

1970.0 --> 1975.519
so i don't know

1973.36 --> 1978.1589999999999
i think it could be pretty cool and even

1975.519 --> 1980.32
just among a couple of flat earthers

1978.159 --> 1981.7600000000002
that kind of live in the same state or

1980.32 --> 1984.48
the same country

1981.76 --> 1985.5
that could also work i'm just

1984.48 --> 1987.919
spitballing here

1985.5 --> 2005.84
[Music]

1987.919 --> 2005.8400000000001
so this food talk is making me hungry

2007.12 --> 2012.1589999999999
we should all move to portugal i don't

2009.039 --> 2012.1589999999999
think they can handle that

2016.96 --> 2021.44
portugal is not exactly a rich country

2027.039 --> 2033.84
or not anymore anyway no life fed today

2029.919 --> 2035.6000000000001
no it's saturday

2033.84 --> 2039.039
but there will be a premiere starting in

2035.6 --> 2039.039
half an hour as usual

2040.96 --> 2045.3600000000001
but i'm going to have a one half hour

2043.12 --> 2046.0
show as i usually do in the weekend so

2045.36 --> 2048.88
i'm still going

2046.0 --> 2048.88
for another hour

2049.2 --> 2053.839
as they are even even going to have

2051.76 --> 2057.28
trump pardon turkey what

2053.839 --> 2061.839
for what i don't know what you're

2057.28 --> 2061.8390000000004
talking about

2086.839 --> 2091.839
what

2088.159 --> 2093.839
god i thought samson i thought you were

2091.839 --> 2095.359
literally talking about the country

2093.839 --> 2098.159
turkey like what

2095.359 --> 2098.159
what did they do

2098.8 --> 2103.8390000000004
yeah but you meant a the bird right

2127.44 --> 2131.68
i think trump should probably just

2129.119 --> 2132.7200000000003
pardon snowden and then give him the

2131.68 --> 2145.839
turkey

2132.72 --> 2145.839
for dinner

2146.16 --> 2154.96
geopolitics of turkey whoa i

2150.0 --> 2154.96
i have very little grip on that ares

2156.839 --> 2159.839
106.

2166.48 --> 2173.839
pardon someone on a death row

2174.24 --> 2179.68
it's not something that should be

2177.68 --> 2187.839
done as some kind of gimmick you know

2179.68 --> 2187.839
people are on death row for a reason

2207.44 --> 2211.92
but i don't know giving them a turkey a

2210.16 --> 2215.839
big turkey dinner or something

2211.92 --> 2215.839
that might be nice why not

2219.2 --> 2229.839
i don't know if they already get

2220.4 --> 2229.839
something like that i don't know i don't

2231.97 --> 2236.0899999999997
[Music]

2247.2 --> 2257.839
that sounds preposterous flatter chord

2249.76 --> 2257.8390000000004
music i don't know

2268.839 --> 2271.839
mm-hmm

2276.079 --> 2278.32
right

2283.04 --> 2290.72
prison called purgatory i don't know

2286.56 --> 2290.72
i could think of worse names for prisons

2293.599 --> 2299.839
please did imply some sort of hope

2305.599 --> 2310.96
oh you heard it claimed somewhere well

2308.64 --> 2314.7999999999997
that's a great lead

2310.96 --> 2317.359
someone claimed it somewhere yeah

2314.8 --> 2319.44
i don't know next time maybe check it if

2317.359 --> 2327.839
there's actually something to it

2319.44 --> 2327.839
it sounds kind of nutty

2332.48 --> 2335.839
shawshank redemption is your favorite

2334.72 --> 2339.2799999999997
movie

2335.839 --> 2342.96
uh yeah

2339.28 --> 2355.8390000000004
i guess it's not bad it's like as a

2342.96 --> 2355.839
movie pretty good it's just so

2369.599 --> 2374.96
yeah i have nothing against the movie

2372.24 --> 2374.9599999999996
but it's just

2380.16 --> 2385.359
it is coming from hollywood you do

2382.72 --> 2388.3199999999997
realize that right so there are multiple

2385.359 --> 2390.3199999999997
secret layers in there too it's just if

2388.32 --> 2393.44
you don't look at it like that

2390.32 --> 2395.599
yeah it's a pretty good movie

2393.44 --> 2398.16
but i can feel that it's basically made

2395.599 --> 2400.56
by people that are

2398.16 --> 2402.64
trying to program everyone you can feel

2400.56 --> 2407.119
it it does happen in the movie

2402.64 --> 2411.2799999999997
it is full of lit like say 90s

2407.119 --> 2414.4
period level influencers

2411.28 --> 2416.0
which is still what has led to where we

2414.4 --> 2418.88
are now

2416.0 --> 2419.68
so that's the reason i like it a little

2418.88 --> 2422.839
less

2419.68 --> 2425.839
but as a standalone movie it's pretty

2422.839 --> 2425.839
good

2426.079 --> 2429.3590000000004
yeah crooks empowered getting taken down

2428.16 --> 2432.24
yeah yeah because

2429.359 --> 2439.839
yeah the the acting was really good i

2432.24 --> 2439.839
agreed to that

2443.839 --> 2447.599
i should watch it again it's been a

2446.4 --> 2453.839
while

2447.599 --> 2453.839
i think i even have it on my computer

2469.599 --> 2472.4
never heard of that

2473.33 --> 2476.469
[Music]

2477.04 --> 2483.33
i did hmm

2480.22 --> 2483.33
[Music]

2486.54 --> 2489.73
[Music]

2502.56 --> 2506.0789999999997
show break out

2506.56 --> 2508.7999999999997
let's

2521.599 --> 2525.04
yeah i know that one

2528.48 --> 2532.319
that's a pretty old movie by the way

2533.92 --> 2551.04
i think it's if i remember correctly it

2536.319 --> 2553.839
was barely even color

2551.04 --> 2555.119
oh right that's the name the man escape

2553.839 --> 2565.839
a man escaped

2555.119 --> 2565.839
56 right right i remember correctly

2569.359 --> 2576.24
anyway whatever is this about

2573.04 --> 2578.8
dinners and prison breaks

2576.24 --> 2580.0789999999997
and death rows what the [ __ ] is

2578.8 --> 2582.079
everybody

2580.079 --> 2584.5600000000004
thinking about having their last meal

2582.079 --> 2593.8390000000004
for being executed or something

2584.56 --> 2593.839
the [ __ ] is this

2607.92 --> 2613.04
use sound to convey the protagonist's

2611.2 --> 2616.3999999999996
desire for freedom was incredible

2613.04 --> 2616.4
right right

2618.839 --> 2621.7599999999998
hmm

2620.0 --> 2624.8
did make notes by the way i haven't even

2621.76 --> 2624.8
gone through them yet

2630.0 --> 2634.24
because i did make a couple of

2631.359 --> 2636.64
interesting notes

2634.24 --> 2638.64
right yeah flat earth debate yesterday

2636.64 --> 2643.04
was pretty damn good

2638.64 --> 2643.04
it's really good enemy can was also in

2646.839 --> 2651.68
there

2648.4 --> 2652.4
yeah iron works again in the evening as

2651.68 --> 2655.5989999999997
expected

2652.4 --> 2658.319
and yeah i was bob globe busters got on

2655.599 --> 2658.319
there again and

2659.52 --> 2663.28
had to break open a discussion about his

2662.16 --> 2667.359
pursuit to

2663.28 --> 2670.1600000000003
figuring out what he calls gravity

2667.359 --> 2672.4
which is basically what is the cause of

2670.16 --> 2675.52
the alignment of the relative density

2672.4 --> 2675.52
displacement axis

2675.76 --> 2681.2000000000003
and then discussed about that for pretty

2677.28 --> 2681.2000000000003
much an hour with me in chat

2681.76 --> 2688.1600000000003
doing what i do when gravity becomes

2685.28 --> 2691.0400000000004
involved in the discussion

2688.16 --> 2692.0
so i spam the chat full but in a civil

2691.04 --> 2693.44
tone so

2692.0 --> 2696.079
it was a pretty good show that being

2693.44 --> 2696.079
there in chat

2700.72 --> 2707.9199999999996
oh yeah

2704.88 --> 2712.1600000000003
yeah and i also basically at some point

2707.92 --> 2716.839
like recognize this interesting

2712.16 --> 2718.319
psychological formula like a universal

2716.839 --> 2721.7599999999998
formula

2718.319 --> 2723.92
oh right yeah thanks adam i always do my

2721.76 --> 2727.3590000000004
best i do notice like every time i do

2723.92 --> 2728.64
that if bob's in the he does read my

2727.359 --> 2730.4
chats

2728.64 --> 2732.0789999999997
so basically he shouts me out in

2730.4 --> 2734.319
response i i do appreciate

2732.079 --> 2736.8
that it gives me a feeling at least i'm

2734.319 --> 2740.0
being taken serious

2736.8 --> 2742.96
but it was cool right but i

2740.0 --> 2742.96
made this statement

2744.839 --> 2752.4
like remembering

2748.16 --> 2756.0789999999997
creates order and strain

2752.4 --> 2758.8
forgetting creates chaos

2756.079 --> 2758.8
and relief

2759.119 --> 2768.56
now there you have an esoteric formula

2763.359 --> 2768.56
or maybe alchemy

2769.44 --> 2778.2400000000002
but yeah i noticed this that it is

2774.8 --> 2780.7200000000003
that that systematic

2778.24 --> 2780.72
it's like

2781.359 --> 2784.88
it almost reveals like the very nature

2784.48 --> 2789.04
of

2784.88 --> 2789.52
the thing remembering and forgetting

2789.04 --> 2792.64
what

2789.52 --> 2795.119
is that what is the function of it what

2792.64 --> 2795.1189999999997
happens

2795.359 --> 2802.64
and how big a contrast the end results

2799.44 --> 2806.079
so yeah remembering creates order and

2802.64 --> 2809.359
strain forgetting creates

2806.079 --> 2809.3590000000004
chaos and relief

2809.44 --> 2813.92
and this is kind of how human beings

2812.16 --> 2815.359
with their consciousness go about in

2813.92 --> 2818.48
life

2815.359 --> 2823.04
those are the two things that

2818.48 --> 2823.04
that guide their path and their

2828.839 --> 2831.839
experience

2841.92 --> 2861.04
you see it how existential that is

2858.16 --> 2863.68
oh god yeah you told me yesterday flat

2861.04 --> 2863.68
accord music

2863.76 --> 2873.8390000000004
gotta be careful with that

2877.92 --> 2884.64
memory mysterious no but memory is also

2881.839 --> 2886.72
like it in ways a choice like you don't

2884.64 --> 2888.319
have full grip of it

2886.72 --> 2889.9199999999996
sometimes you don't remember something

2888.319 --> 2893.44
specific

2889.92 --> 2898.0
but you can have like an attitude choice

2893.44 --> 2901.52
towards what you choose to be aware of

2898.0 --> 2905.04
from everything you've learned see

2901.52 --> 2908.88
and that's what it applies to

2905.04 --> 2911.68
remembering remember

2908.88 --> 2912.88
creates order you can literally see

2911.68 --> 2916.8799999999997
order you can

2912.88 --> 2918.48
guide with the oversight of remembering

2916.88 --> 2920.559
but it brings strain it brings the

2918.48 --> 2922.48
responsibility it's stressful the more

2920.559 --> 2926.6400000000003
you see the more strainful it is i've

2922.48 --> 2926.64
been literally conveying this for years

2926.8 --> 2930.2400000000002
the opposite for getting literally

2929.2 --> 2932.319
forget about it

2930.24 --> 2934.16
you know it's like this is too much well

2932.319 --> 2934.88
like what am i gonna do just be stressed

2934.16 --> 2937.2799999999997
out and

2934.88 --> 2938.2400000000002
feel miserable you know that's it's not

2937.28 --> 2941.44
like it's evil

2938.24 --> 2945.2
it's just the other motion

2941.44 --> 2945.839
so forgetting does not create order when

2945.2 --> 2948.96
somebody

2945.839 --> 2952.24
forgets steps away they basically

2948.96 --> 2955.119
relinquish their responsibility and then

2952.24 --> 2956.7999999999997
their influence in that situation

2955.119 --> 2958.559
becomes chaotic

2956.8 --> 2960.2400000000002
there's no more order that comes from it

2958.559 --> 2963.599
because they step away they lose

2960.24 --> 2966.72
oversight they create chaos

2963.599 --> 2969.28
but it is very relieving

2966.72 --> 2971.359
it's a big burden off your shoulders if

2969.28 --> 2976.079
it is too much for you to handle

2971.359 --> 2979.2
you see and that's

2976.079 --> 2982.88
yeah that's a big core

2979.2 --> 2986.24
esoteric system of what

2982.88 --> 2987.04
we do human beings with their

2986.24 --> 2989.7599999999998
consciousness

2987.04 --> 2989.7599999999998
and their life

2992.48 --> 2997.28
intellectual distancing well you could

2995.28 --> 2999.28
call for getting intellectual distancing

2997.28 --> 3000.48
although you'd be distancing from your

2999.28 --> 3004.079
own intellect

3000.48 --> 3005.44
in a way literally losing oversight

3004.079 --> 3008.2400000000002
that's not what that's for though

3005.44 --> 3010.559
intellectual decency distancing is a

3008.24 --> 3012.64
measure that's specifically designated

3010.559 --> 3014.0
from a person not infected with the

3012.64 --> 3017.52
coriolis virus

3014.0 --> 3019.04
towards people obviously infected with

3017.52 --> 3021.68
the coriolis virus

3019.04 --> 3022.4
tested and tested positive that's what

3021.68 --> 3026.319
that's for

3022.4 --> 3029.359
for the not infected people

3026.319 --> 3033.44
to keep so intellectual distance to keep

3029.359 --> 3037.2
their mind from latching on

3033.44 --> 3039.68
to the mega delusion and confusion

3037.2 --> 3040.7999999999997
from people that are subjected to the

3039.68 --> 3043.7599999999998
coriolis virus

3040.8 --> 3046.4
see so it's not the same type of

3043.76 --> 3046.4
distancing

3047.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
i know i know

3058.559 --> 3065.44
right yeah so intellectual distancing

3062.72 --> 3067.52
might even be a general solution for a

3065.44 --> 3071.92
lot of other

3067.52 --> 3075.7599999999998
viral problems you know in ways

3071.92 --> 3075.76
globe zealotry in general

3076.16 --> 3083.04
you know if if it gets to you too much

3079.359 --> 3083.52
then in a way intellectual distancing or

3083.04 --> 3085.7599999999998
at least

3083.52 --> 3087.359
emotional distancing will be very

3085.76 --> 3091.119
helpful

3087.359 --> 3093.92
it will prevent you from i don't know

3091.119 --> 3110.559
losing control over yourself and maybe

3093.92 --> 3114.44
ending up in a similar thing

3110.559 --> 3117.51
the virus ends with us coriolis fires

3114.44 --> 3117.51
[Music]

3120.319 --> 3126.64
come on tear it 3006

3124.0 --> 3130.04
you know better than that simon dan

3126.64 --> 3132.48
never goes on some on a

3130.04 --> 3135.599
non-colleague baller

3132.48 --> 3138.64
show ever ever ever ever ever

3135.599 --> 3140.4
never ever he never will

3138.64 --> 3142.8799999999997
if he does that it's probably gonna be

3140.4 --> 3144.319
the last time he appears on the internet

3142.88 --> 3146.96
because after that he would not know

3144.319 --> 3149.44
what to do with himself anymore

3146.96 --> 3150.839
you know he stays away because he he is

3149.44 --> 3153.52
kind of a

3150.839 --> 3155.599
coward like it's not even his

3153.52 --> 3159.04
choice to be a coward i think i think he

3155.599 --> 3162.079
is a natural coward sounds really bad

3159.04 --> 3162.88
but i think he is and so he's keeping

3162.079 --> 3165.3590000000004
his distance

3162.88 --> 3167.839
probably because he really can't handle

3165.359 --> 3172.72
a direct confrontation like that

3167.839 --> 3172.72
like for himself so

3173.04 --> 3178.079
yeah he's never gonna come on like

3175.52 --> 3180.64
nathan's or

3178.079 --> 3181.52
even on with like spurskimo or anything

3180.64 --> 3184.24
like have you

3181.52 --> 3185.2
ever seen him engage with a with a flat

3184.24 --> 3190.9599999999996
earther

3185.2 --> 3190.96
other than in chat never never seen it

3191.92 --> 3195.28
sometimes i think he has like a visceral

3194.72 --> 3198.0789999999997
fear

3195.28 --> 3199.28
of flat earthers like a real like a

3198.079 --> 3201.28
presence

3199.28 --> 3203.6800000000003
like he's it really scares him maybe i

3201.28 --> 3203.6800000000003
don't know

3203.839 --> 3206.88
if it were then he's actually kind of

3205.68 --> 3211.04
brave for

3206.88 --> 3215.52
what he does how ironic would that be

3211.04 --> 3215.52
but yeah he's never gonna come on

3220.72 --> 3225.7599999999998
right dan requires a script well you

3223.68 --> 3228.24
know what effectively

3225.76 --> 3229.6800000000003
i could literally just hand him the

3228.24 --> 3232.72
script that he seeks

3229.68 --> 3233.68
live on the spot i could just give him

3232.72 --> 3237.52
whatever he

3233.68 --> 3240.48
is looking for can't find him on his own

3237.52 --> 3242.64
you know we got the script we got all

3240.48 --> 3245.119
the scripts at flat earth debates

3242.64 --> 3245.839
we can literally give them advice on

3245.119 --> 3248.8
what to say

3245.839 --> 3249.599
next and it will actually make them look

3248.8 --> 3251.76
smart

3249.599 --> 3254.319
in front of the other ballers not in

3251.76 --> 3257.599
front of us of course

3254.319 --> 3260.64
but yeah we can hand them the arguments

3257.599 --> 3260.6400000000003
that they are looking for

3260.88 --> 3265.6800000000003
it's just that we don't typically like

3262.88 --> 3269.04
to hand them complete double speak

3265.68 --> 3270.3999999999996
arguments that are self-contradictory

3269.04 --> 3272.24
within the same sentence

3270.4 --> 3274.0
and yeah unfortunately a lot of ballers

3272.24 --> 3277.2
that get on the flat earth debate do

3274.0 --> 3280.96
have tendencies to go there

3277.2 --> 3283.359
but yeah other than that

3280.96 --> 3286.96
you don't need a script we can hand you

3283.359 --> 3286.96
every argument you're looking for

3287.359 --> 3293.839
or i could if nathan allows me

3297.68 --> 3302.16
all right yes that's that's right golden

3301.359 --> 3305.359
wellies

3302.16 --> 3308.96
fed is not a debate

3305.359 --> 3313.839
it's a giant permanent

3308.96 --> 3313.839
victory dance that's what it is

3314.799 --> 3319.92
permanent victory dance

3317.839 --> 3323.44
that's what the flat earth debate is

3319.92 --> 3323.44
because we won a long time ago

3326.319 --> 3330.799
we are basically just chiseling out the

3328.64 --> 3334.4
details of our giant

3330.799 --> 3349.839
monolithic victory statue at this moment

3334.4 --> 3349.839
so yeah

3352.72 --> 3356.0789999999997
next one yep

3366.4 --> 3370.2400000000002
in ways it would be pretty amusing even

3368.88 --> 3374.079
though i don't

3370.24 --> 3374.0789999999997
recommend anybody literally do it

3374.559 --> 3378.48
to get like the places where there are

3377.119 --> 3380.799
like statues of these

3378.48 --> 3382.319
supposed globe pioneer people and

3380.799 --> 3385.359
everything

3382.319 --> 3388.16
and you know they're there now that

3385.359 --> 3390.24
how funny would be not to like tear them

3388.16 --> 3394.319
down that [ __ ]

3390.24 --> 3397.2
but like put gravity on it

3394.319 --> 3398.079
and then literally gravity the arguments

3397.2 --> 3400.319
for white

3398.079 --> 3401.44
there's not a globe over the statues of

3400.319 --> 3404.16
these supposed

3401.44 --> 3405.839
glow pioneers how freaking hilarious

3404.16 --> 3408.0
would that be

3405.839 --> 3410.16
not saying you should do that by the way

3408.0 --> 3413.76
but the idea is

3410.16 --> 3418.72
pretty appealing to me then again

3413.76 --> 3421.599
yeah gravity it is kind of vandalism so

3418.72 --> 3423.1189999999997
i'm not telling anyone to do that but

3421.599 --> 3426.559
the idea is pretty

3423.119 --> 3433.839
funny at least raffiti

3426.559 --> 3433.8390000000004
not gravity you can't spray gravity

3434.48 --> 3439.76
yeah it's graffiti right i had the

3437.359 --> 3444.24
saliva on

3439.76 --> 3444.2400000000002
the wrong emphasis on the wrong survival

3444.839 --> 3447.839
yep

3464.079 --> 3475.8390000000004
what what

3467.599 --> 3475.839
the what are you saying daniel field

3500.839 --> 3507.04
right so nobody go anywhere i'm still

3503.68 --> 3507.04
going for another half hour

3509.44 --> 3517.839
and i'm up for subjects

3522.96 --> 3530.96
gravity and germ theory you roll off the

3525.599 --> 3545.839
tongue in similar ways what do you mean

3530.96 --> 3545.839
what do you mean flat earth accord music

3591.68 --> 3595.839
all right okay i think i understand what

3594.16 --> 3599.44
you mean

3595.839 --> 3601.52
they are like virtual teachings

3599.44 --> 3604.4
that because they are inconclusive and

3601.52 --> 3604.4
manipulated

3604.559 --> 3609.0400000000004
it can be used again as a virtual

3607.2 --> 3612.0
feeding trough for people

3609.04 --> 3614.319
to manipulate them so it can just be oh

3612.0 --> 3615.52
gravity this gravity that it does all

3614.319 --> 3618.5589999999997
that

3615.52 --> 3622.16
or virus this virus that oh virus is so

3618.559 --> 3626.4
dangerous you have to do this to that

3622.16 --> 3630.0
in that sense i don't know

3626.4 --> 3643.839
i don't really see the parallels too

3630.0 --> 3643.839
much but i think i get your point

3645.42 --> 3648.53
[Music]

3652.72 --> 3656.3999999999996
yeah with gravity however it is kind of

3654.88 --> 3659.44
different you know

3656.4 --> 3662.48
because with kind of like

3659.44 --> 3664.559
virus theory yeah it is supposedly

3662.48 --> 3667.2
established it's kind of dubious

3664.559 --> 3669.44
but it's still being accepted as

3667.2 --> 3671.2799999999997
legitimate proof viruses are real and

3669.44 --> 3672.4
all that is a different scenario from

3671.28 --> 3674.3190000000004
gravity

3672.4 --> 3676.079
because gravity in that sense is much

3674.319 --> 3679.7599999999998
much weirder

3676.079 --> 3683.44
because they don't actually

3679.76 --> 3685.5200000000004
have any official proof of gravity

3683.44 --> 3687.28
still looking for it it's like literally

3685.52 --> 3690.079
like they're still looking for

3687.28 --> 3691.599
the proof of gravity they just assume

3690.079 --> 3694.4
it's there

3691.599 --> 3696.079
is it's being pursued the pursuit of

3694.4 --> 3699.839
gravity

3696.079 --> 3699.8390000000004
that's the big difference

3704.24 --> 3712.3999999999996
you know they're not pursuing

3707.28 --> 3714.96
virus theory they

3712.4 --> 3717.039
say they supposedly know how that works

3714.96 --> 3719.599
how it is they model it they have cgi

3717.039 --> 3721.92
drawings blah blah blah all that

3719.599 --> 3723.76
then they give you the solution on how

3721.92 --> 3726.4
to deal with it

3723.76 --> 3728.2400000000002
invest billions in pharmaceutical

3726.4 --> 3731.92
companies

3728.24 --> 3734.9599999999996
take away their liability and just

3731.92 --> 3736.2400000000002
yeah do that

3734.96 --> 3739.039
that's what they do with that well

3736.24 --> 3740.8799999999997
gravity is just not even official

3739.039 --> 3743.119
it's just that it's such a popular

3740.88 --> 3747.119
concept that's not being let go and

3743.119 --> 3750.7200000000003
people are literally just pursuing this

3747.119 --> 3752.4
like to find the proof of the gravity

3750.72 --> 3755.1189999999997
what is it

3752.4 --> 3756.559
why the alignment that you know from

3755.119 --> 3759.76
every angle it's like from

3756.559 --> 3762.1600000000003
within globe skeptics even like why

3759.76 --> 3764.7990000000004
the alignment oh gravity must be

3762.16 --> 3768.0789999999997
something causing that or

3764.799 --> 3771.2
in the heliocentric model like why how

3768.079 --> 3775.119
can we measure gravity the

3771.2 --> 3777.68
gripple of gravity the gravity particle

3775.119 --> 3779.2000000000003
maybe subatomic particle the gravity

3777.68 --> 3783.0389999999998
particles that are phased

3779.2 --> 3786.799
in and out of the other dimensions

3783.039 --> 3789.5200000000004
all over the place right reality

3786.799 --> 3790.0
they still have to find the fundamental

3789.52 --> 3792.72
proof

3790.0 --> 3793.68
that it is actually a thing within

3792.72 --> 3796.9599999999996
physics that's

3793.68 --> 3797.2
that's the difference in virus theory it

3796.96 --> 3799.119
is

3797.2 --> 3803.839
claimed they have this and it is

3799.119 --> 3803.839
accepted officially as if they had this

3804.96 --> 3811.839
that's the difference

3811.87 --> 3816.96
[Music]

3815.28 --> 3818.559
gravity was just left with the bending

3816.96 --> 3821.839
of space time and

3818.559 --> 3823.6800000000003
yeah screw you that was it like you

3821.839 --> 3839.839
figure out what gravity is if you want

3823.68 --> 3839.839
it so much

3847.76 --> 3853.8390000000004
what you mean made up hiv doesn't exist

3854.96 --> 3867.839
i'm not sure but i do know that hiv

3859.039 --> 3867.8390000000004
and the aids condition are not related

3870.079 --> 3881.8390000000004
and it all has to much more do with your

3873.68 --> 3881.839
overall bodily conditions

3882.16 --> 3884.799
so again

right exactly george sanford

3899.91 --> 3903.06
[Music]

3906.839 --> 3909.839
so

3922.96 --> 3927.119
i don't i don't even know officially

3925.76 --> 3930.3190000000004
what the hiv

3927.119 --> 3933.119
virus is support is even supposed to be

3930.319 --> 3935.359
doing when you're affected with it i

3933.119 --> 3937.2000000000003
don't even know i just know the story

3935.359 --> 3939.7599999999998
that it could eventually

3937.2 --> 3942.16
trigger aids that's what i know that's

3939.76 --> 3944.7990000000004
all i know but i didn't study into that

3942.16 --> 3947.52
i was never that interested that there

3944.799 --> 3950.96
are other people that have

3947.52 --> 3951.839
but i don't even know what the supposed

3950.96 --> 3955.039
age

3951.839 --> 3958.0
of the hiv virus would

3955.039 --> 3960.7200000000003
physically be doing i don't even know

3958.0 --> 3960.72
what it does

3962.839 --> 3965.839
officially

3969.839 --> 3975.2
is cancer real oh yeah sure it is

3975.68 --> 3993.839
it's just a matter of what is it what

3978.72 --> 3993.839
isn't really

3998.72 --> 4009.5989999999997
how how is that even possible

4007.119 --> 4021.52
i thought it was the aids that actually

4009.599 --> 4025.039
did that

4021.52 --> 4030.24
obey hiv drugs ah

4025.039 --> 4030.2400000000002
yeah might have a point there

4032.559 --> 4037.3590000000004
right that was the narrative right right

4034.4 --> 4040.88
okay okay yeah i remember that

4037.359 --> 4043.2
but how

4040.88 --> 4045.52
the idea was that it goes into the

4043.2 --> 4047.7599999999998
immune cells and then replicates and

4045.52 --> 4051.92
destroys the immune cells

4047.76 --> 4051.92
something that was an idea right

4052.319 --> 4056.079
but how can then people

4057.44 --> 4063.68
have this supposed hiv virus like for

4061.359 --> 4066.319
i think even officially like 20 or 30

4063.68 --> 4069.839
years and just not get aids

4066.319 --> 4069.839
that makes no freaking sense

4070.16 --> 4075.2799999999997
if there is liter if it attacks the

4071.839 --> 4077.599
immune cells then there is no defense

4075.28 --> 4080.3190000000004
against it why could it take that long

4077.599 --> 4084.2400000000002
then it makes no sense

4080.319 --> 4084.24
so none of it makes any sense

4088.839 --> 4091.839
right

4093.84 --> 4097.019
[Music]

4125.92 --> 4129.1990000000005
all right yeah flat record music and

4128.08 --> 4131.839
it's even

4129.199 --> 4133.199
more interesting is that it's not even

4131.839 --> 4135.6
just human beings i

4133.199 --> 4137.599999999999
i heard a story from my dad just a while

4135.6 --> 4138.4800000000005
ago i don't know the exact details who

4137.6 --> 4142.88
did that

4138.48 --> 4147.759
that there were tests with the colds

4142.88 --> 4150.64
and even the flu with like with horses

4147.759 --> 4152.0
like from their range of disease because

4150.64 --> 4154.799
it's slightly different

4152.0 --> 4155.12
and then they would put like a muzzle

4154.799 --> 4158.56
like

4155.12 --> 4161.599999999999
with a muzzle worn by

4158.56 --> 4163.92
a supposed infected

4161.6 --> 4165.759
horse that was like obviously snottering

4163.92 --> 4168.08
and [ __ ]

4165.759 --> 4169.6
and then yeah well they got the snot out

4168.08 --> 4171.759
of it

4169.6 --> 4174.64
but then they just put that muzzle on

4171.759 --> 4177.759
another healthy horse for like

4174.64 --> 4180.4800000000005
hours and then they wouldn't get sick

4177.759 --> 4180.48
they just wouldn't

4180.96 --> 4189.839
at all so

4185.12 --> 4189.839
yeah it's

4192.319 --> 4203.84
it just seems like the entire model kind

4194.719 --> 4203.84
of mismatches

4212.64 --> 4219.52
hmm oh thanks yes

4216.48 --> 4231.839999999999
that's probably yes samson

4219.52 --> 4231.84
thank you

weird

4270.64 --> 4277.04
don't see any difference on the screen

4274.0 --> 4277.04
but it's my eyes

4277.76 --> 4284.96
they've my eyes now seem to

4280.8 --> 4284.96
feel like it's getting dark or something

4300.32 --> 4303.679
bacterium pneumonia

4311.6 --> 4316.56
i don't know what really did it george

4314.4 --> 4319.36
sanford i don't really know what really

4316.56 --> 4319.360000000001
happened back then

4321.12 --> 4324.96
i know there was a lot of

4322.44 --> 4327.44
experimentation being done

4324.96 --> 4328.4800000000005
in the middle of like the ruckus of the

4327.44 --> 4334.159
big

4328.48 --> 4334.159
yeah changes because of war

4335.679 --> 4340.0
so i bet they've just did a lot of

4337.84 --> 4342.96
experimental injections

4340.0 --> 4344.32
and then there's also the yeah the

4342.96 --> 4347.6
erection

4344.32 --> 4352.5599999999995
of the erection of

4347.6 --> 4352.56
the real radio system and

4353.36 --> 4359.04
i've heard that that also is a potential

4356.719 --> 4362.08
influencer or a cause of just

4359.04 --> 4365.84
massive like

4362.08 --> 4369.04
a shock effect metabolic unlike all life

4365.84 --> 4372.719
and that it that also contributed

4369.04 --> 4374.159
to this death wave basically them

4372.719 --> 4377.679
erecting the first

4374.159 --> 4380.879999999999
big signal radio towers

4377.679 --> 4383.679
pumping out a lot of energy with that

4380.88 --> 4384.08
that's what i heard but i have no direct

4383.679 --> 4387.36
proof

4384.08 --> 4388.159
for that that i i've tested but it's

4387.36 --> 4390.159
among the

4388.159 --> 4391.679
things that were happening back then as

4390.159 --> 4393.679
well so it's not

4391.679 --> 4396.4800000000005
it's probably a combination of all these

4393.679 --> 4399.76
things it's just big demoralization from

4396.48 --> 4402.718999999999
war slaughter and propaganda

4399.76 --> 4403.679
vaccine trials totally experimental and

4402.719 --> 4406.8
the erection

4403.679 --> 4412.4
of the radio system and

4406.8 --> 4414.159000000001
its influence its invisible influence

4412.4 --> 4426.879999999999
all of that kind of happened roughly

4414.159 --> 4429.12
around the same period

4426.88 --> 4430.96
was the black death 14th century

4429.12 --> 4434.159
man-made

4430.96 --> 4437.92
yes in a sense that

4434.159 --> 4441.759999999999
people again were put into extremely

4437.92 --> 4445.4400000000005
unsanitary conditions

4441.76 --> 4447.280000000001

from the nobility towards the common

4447.28 --> 4451.679

now when you're starved and you're

4451.679 --> 4456.32
demoralized and you're in

4453.28 --> 4459.5199999999995
unsanitary conditions well

really caused that

this flat accord music come on

the rest of my life for however long it

4530.88 --> 4535.12
lasts

4531.84 --> 4539.360000000001
depending on where things really go

4535.12 --> 4542.5599999999995

absolutely fake everything about it is

financially smart move to do something

4549.76 --> 4553.679
with it

fake it always was fake it's all

4567.6 --> 4571.280000000001

4568.159 --> 4575.04
it's lie after lie after lie

4571.28 --> 4579.5199999999995
historical alteration truth manipulation

4575.04 --> 4582.48
narrative tinkering

4579.52 --> 4583.6
to reinforce the false belief that these

4582.48 --> 4586.48
things are real

4583.6 --> 4589.92
to imprint that on the next generations

4586.48 --> 4592.959999999999
that'll only just read back about it

4589.92 --> 4595.04
and what else do they have

4592.96 --> 4597.44
they don't listen to their parents they

4595.04 --> 4600.159
don't listen to truthers

4597.44 --> 4602.0
so they will just take it as real and

4600.159 --> 4604.5599999999995
then be subjected to whatever

4602.0 --> 4605.6
eugenics euthanization program that is

4604.56 --> 4608.2390000000005
offered to them

4605.6 --> 4608.64

4608.239 --> 4610.48
don't

4608.64 --> 4612.400000000001
know what is real or not and that's why

4610.48 --> 4613.28
i'm spending the rest of my life

4612.4 --> 4615.839999999999
reminding

4613.28 --> 4618.48
everybody at all times what is real and

what is not

at some point as i am doing right now

always be that thorn

4638.88 --> 4641.4400000000005
assassinate me to make me stop because i

4641.04 --> 4645.28
will

4641.44 --> 4647.759999999999
never stop ever under any conditions no

4685.76 --> 4690.84
so much of this official this following

4688.32 --> 4693.679
of the official narrative grab

4690.84 --> 4695.679
right

4693.679 --> 4697.4400000000005
well you know you can always restart an

4695.679 --> 4699.4400000000005
inner monologue the problem is though

4697.44 --> 4704.839999999999
when you do if it's

4699.44 --> 4709.12
if it's off it's off because

4704.84 --> 4712.2390000000005
of i guess spiritual abuse

4709.12 --> 4714.719
it's off because you were convinced that

4712.239 --> 4717.12
it's not a viable mechanism because

4714.719 --> 4718.8
it was trashed by your parents by your

4717.12 --> 4721.599999999999
teachers

4718.8 --> 4722.64
they only discourage you and then it's

4721.6 --> 4725.76
turn off

4722.64 --> 4727.679
you become a blind follower and then

4725.76 --> 4729.6
if you reconfront yourself with that

4727.679 --> 4732.719
mechanism try to reboot it

4729.6 --> 4734.8
yeah all that hell all that hell that

4732.719 --> 4736.8
got in there in order for you to close

4734.8 --> 4738.4800000000005
it off is gonna come floating and

4736.8 --> 4741.12
they're all gonna be screaming and

4738.48 --> 4745.678999999999
foaming at the mouth

4741.12 --> 4745.679
sort of like you know i've experienced

4745.76 --> 4750.320000000001
and that's the only way to get it back

4748.0 --> 4752.0
it's just a lot of pain to dig

4750.32 --> 4753.92
through you know because that's what

4752.0 --> 4757.6
they do all this mind control

4753.92 --> 4760.719
all rests

4757.6 --> 4763.92
on the mechanism that so many people

4760.719 --> 4764.4800000000005
just don't know how to deal with the

4763.92 --> 4768.4800000000005
pain

4764.48 --> 4771.199
of reality in order to overcome it

4768.48 --> 4772.08
they just don't know how to do it and

4771.199 --> 4774.32
they're not taught

4772.08 --> 4777.12
how to do it they're not encouraged to

4774.32 --> 4779.5199999999995
do it

4777.12 --> 4781.679
that's why i am encouraging it and

4779.52 --> 4784.56
literally trying to hand over

4781.679 --> 4786.32
virtual skills to people like literally

4784.56 --> 4790.0
copy me copy this skill

4786.32 --> 4793.12
try it out do it yourself trust yourself

4790.0 --> 4796.08
it can work it hurts at first

4793.12 --> 4797.92
because of why it was not developed in

4796.08 --> 4800.0
the first place

4797.92 --> 4802.0
it's gonna be a confrontation but you

4800.0 --> 4805.84
can get it back

4802.0 --> 4809.92
and you should

4805.84 --> 4812.4800000000005
because it's better to remember

4809.92 --> 4814.32
your yourself and your true skills and

4812.48 --> 4817.199
what really happened

4814.32 --> 4818.159
and create order with that and take the

4817.199 --> 4821.5199999999995
strain

4818.159 --> 4824.799999999999
than it is to just forget it all create

4821.52 --> 4828.719
a lot of chaos just be

4824.8 --> 4828.719
just for some temporary relief

4829.92 --> 4835.76
because yeah that path with the chaos

4833.28 --> 4837.679
will eventually drag you into your

4835.76 --> 4840.56
senseless death

4837.679 --> 4840.56
when you could have

4840.8 --> 4844.08
been restored when you could have

4842.639 --> 4845.52
regenerated when you could have

4844.08 --> 4847.84
completed yourself

yesterday no was it yesterday no the day

4908.88 --> 4914.08
before

4910.08 --> 4916.159

4914.08 --> 4917.679
even in the middle of the day to do

4916.159 --> 4919.44
power naps

4917.679 --> 4921.36
you know if you really have trouble

4919.44 --> 4922.638999999999
sleeping at the time when you should be

4921.36 --> 4925.04
sleeping

4922.639 --> 4927.1990000000005
then try to compensate just for the

4925.04 --> 4931.12
regeneration cycle of your body

4927.199 --> 4932.879999999999
to do power naps in the afternoon

4931.12 --> 4935.04
and it might actually work out really

4932.88 --> 4940.32
well it does for me when that happens

4935.04 --> 4940.32
i really get deep sleep so maybe try

4942.84 --> 4945.84
that

4947.6 --> 4959.84
also cut down on the coffee if you drink

most of you there as well it should

5023.679 --> 5028.639
start up in

5026.159 --> 5031.44
i don't know four and a half hours

5028.639 --> 5031.4400000000005
something like that

5033.04 --> 5043.84
or is it or is it five and a half hours

5035.28 --> 5043.84
i don't know

5044.88 --> 5050.0
those evil croissants what what

5054.84 --> 5057.84
what

5058.159 --> 5061.5199999999995
wait what are you talking about

5063.199 --> 5074.32
with no voice oh right right

5071.52 --> 5074.320000000001
what is this

5074.639 --> 5077.6
get out of here

5082.84 --> 5085.84
right

5092.239 --> 5098.5599999999995
you know what is also put yeah

5095.76 --> 5098.96
this literally just came to me i read

5098.56 --> 5101.04
your

5098.96 --> 5103.52
or the article you posted flat accord

5101.04 --> 5106.239
music today's the digital

5103.52 --> 5107.4400000000005
about people with no inner monologue and

5106.239 --> 5109.5199999999995
i instantly

5107.44 --> 5112.96
remembered something pretty esoteric and

5109.52 --> 5114.8
that is

5112.96 --> 5116.4
there have been people that had no inner

5114.8 --> 5121.4400000000005
monologue

5116.4 --> 5125.679
like women this is all fiathia

5121.44 --> 5130.0
in my past that people that have no

5125.679 --> 5132.639
inner monologue and then they get a kid

5130.0 --> 5134.08
and then suddenly that kid like

5132.639 --> 5137.28
psionically

5134.08 --> 5140.32
opens their inner monologue for them

5137.28 --> 5142.639
they start to just

5140.32 --> 5144.0
ask questions and then almost like out

5142.639 --> 5147.28
of sheer necessity the

5144.0 --> 5151.52
uh the inner monologue just restarts

5147.28 --> 5151.5199999999995
in the mother have you ever heard of

5152.84 --> 5155.84
that

5158.32 --> 5161.84
because the children do that

5160.639 --> 5167.28
automatically

5161.84 --> 5170.4800000000005
chill children are telepathic naturally

5167.28 --> 5172.239
in the way that it is it's just there

5170.48 --> 5174.32
and the mother is the first person they

5172.239 --> 5176.08
connect to telepathically

5174.32 --> 5178.0
and if the mother doesn't have an inner

5176.08 --> 5181.12
monologue

5178.0 --> 5184.32
that will be

5181.12 --> 5185.76
come very upfront very close to their

5184.32 --> 5189.84
consciousness and they have no

5185.76 --> 5193.360000000001
choice but to restart it

5189.84 --> 5196.96
they must or they'll go crazy or they'll

5193.36 --> 5196.96
end up rejecting that child

5207.39 --> 5211.089
[Music]

5216.96 --> 5221.92
right never heard about that well it's

5220.239 --> 5224.48
very esoteric i

5221.92 --> 5227.04
have no empirical proof or anything or

5224.48 --> 5231.62
studies to fall back on i just

5227.04 --> 5232.88
know it's true i just it has to be

5231.62 --> 5237.12
[Music]

5232.88 --> 5239.4400000000005
just yeah based on my own experience and

5237.12 --> 5241.92
what other very talented spiritual

5239.44 --> 5246.0
people have told me as well

5241.92 --> 5249.1990000000005
from their experiences it's just yeah

5246.0 --> 5249.199
that seems logical

5250.84 --> 5254.56
or as some category of people like to

5254.08 --> 5259.36
say

5254.56 --> 5259.360000000001
the model seems very plausible

5260.56 --> 5264.719
because it is not tested in a literal

5263.199 --> 5268.32
sense

5264.719 --> 5270.719
it's just cross-referencing and puzzling

5268.32 --> 5273.28
trying to find a model to fit what is

5270.719 --> 5273.28
going on

5278.239 --> 5284.959999999999
right yeah thanks flat accord music

5281.92 --> 5288.719
yeah keep that in mind and

5284.96 --> 5290.4800000000005
yeah see you know but don't forget that

5288.719 --> 5295.84
i know this i don't know this from

5290.48 --> 5295.839999999999
personal experience but i know it from

5297.44 --> 5304.4
empathic experiences of others

5300.639 --> 5307.52
that yeah children especially if

5304.4 --> 5310.08
you are still if you have great

5307.52 --> 5312.080000000001
psionic talents and all that inherent in

5310.08 --> 5316.48
your genetics

5312.08 --> 5319.199
children will immediately utilize every

5316.48 --> 5320.239
last bit of that automatically they will

5319.199 --> 5322.48
be effectively

5320.239 --> 5324.48
telepathic psionic however you see that

5322.48 --> 5328.48
depending on the skill range of

5324.48 --> 5332.879999999999
the genetic group as it were

5328.48 --> 5334.959999999999
and yeah if you didn't realize that

5332.88 --> 5336.400000000001
as a parent you are going to be forced

5334.96 --> 5339.44
into that one way or the other

5336.4 --> 5342.08
you are going to connect it's go it

5339.44 --> 5343.599999999999
the kid is going to connect to you and

5342.08 --> 5346.0
if you can deal with that

5343.6 --> 5348.56
then they will take control over you

5346.0 --> 5348.56
with that

5348.88 --> 5352.639
because it is kind of and yeah every

5350.8 --> 5355.12
good parrot knows this nathan oakley

5352.639 --> 5358.159000000001
knows this i know he knows i've seen it

5355.12 --> 5361.44
it's like a psionic boxing match

5358.159 --> 5364.879999999999
unspoken sometimes it happens

5361.44 --> 5369.36
that's what that's it's there

5364.88 --> 5373.04
it was always there it's just not really

5369.36 --> 5379.839999999999

5373.04 --> 5379.84
