1.879 --> 9.839
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.819 --> 15.838999999999999
early-bird number 25 I'm your host

9.839 --> 18.269
Arwen but yes welcome we're starting an

15.839 --> 20.58
hour earlier on Monday and I'm gonna

18.269 --> 23.429
keep on doing this I have no objections

20.58 --> 28.519
to doing it and works out with Nathan

23.429 --> 31.829
scheduled so we don't overlap yeah

28.519 --> 34.769999999999996
downside is doesn't seem to be anybody

31.829 --> 39.120000000000005
out there yet maybe a little bit too

34.77 --> 41.43000000000001
early for the Americans and I don't know

39.12 --> 42.93
but I hope to see some people arrive

41.43 --> 46.62
here soon

42.93 --> 54.480000000000004
yes about yesterday I didn't show up and

46.62 --> 56.64
that's because he basically went over to

54.48 --> 60.0
the coffee shop again and bumped into

56.64 --> 64.23
this really really interesting Dutch

60.0 --> 66.6
person and yeah we rolled into a

64.23 --> 70.2
conversation about a lot of things and

66.6 --> 72.39
avoided talking about flat earth for a

70.2 --> 75.12
long time and talked about alternative

72.39 --> 77.82
history about how science is faked in

75.12 --> 79.65
many areas and how that works to

77.82 --> 86.78999999999999
presuppositional things and everything

79.65 --> 90.95
and as we talk here that he is a very

86.79 --> 93.75
curious person there's a lot and he

90.95 --> 95.67
basically had already been confronted

93.75 --> 100.89
with Flat Earth because he started to

95.67 --> 103.53
ask these type of questions like like

100.89 --> 106.98
are you like like that yeah referencing

103.53 --> 110.16
the Flat Earth theory and also all the

106.98 --> 113.46000000000001
typical presumptions about it like it's

110.16 --> 115.59
a religion and so we eventually we

113.46 --> 117.44999999999999
rolled into flat earth and I basically

115.59 --> 119.64
came out directly like yeah my channel

117.45 --> 122.28
is about Flat Earth it's that's the

119.64 --> 126.42
foundation of it there's a lot more to

122.28 --> 129.03
it than just that and would you like to

126.42 --> 132.15
know because there really is something

129.03 --> 134.34
to it just think about what I what we

132.15 --> 136.34900000000002
talked about before this all the

134.34 --> 140.16
bakery that's already out there well

136.349 --> 140.819
this is just the same but on a global

140.16 --> 143.28
scale

140.819 --> 147.45
and yeah you even subscribe to my

143.28 --> 150.629
channel I don't know I don't think he

147.45 --> 155.879
has any activity except for just

150.629 --> 164.879
watching videos but see this account

155.879 --> 170.31
name was oh yeah art beau beaucoup

164.879 --> 172.07899999999998
witness anyway yeah that was why I was

170.31 --> 176.25
delayed because basically I started

172.079 --> 177.989
talking it didn't had basically 45

176.25 --> 181.91
minutes or something and we ended up

177.989 --> 186.12
talking for over an hour

181.91 --> 190.92
it was really good talk and yeah I hope

186.12 --> 193.62
I even invited him on my show so he yeah

190.92 --> 195.599
you know to my way to contact me and

193.62 --> 198.6
everything and who knows that would be

195.599 --> 200.16
really interesting he studies English so

198.6 --> 202.68
he shouldn't have too big a problem

200.16 --> 205.859
having an actual conversation about more

202.68 --> 207.45000000000002
complex things in English and it'll be a

205.859 --> 209.84
good challenge for them in that regard

207.45 --> 213.89999999999998
so for him it'll be a win-win situation

209.84 --> 216.989
so yeah well that's why I was 40 minutes

213.9 --> 217.47
late and basically postpone the show to

216.989 --> 220.22
today

217.47 --> 230.51
I see some people have arrived to check

220.22 --> 234.5
dank then you'll feel and ute right yeah

230.51 --> 238.07899999999998
outside my window now it's not to heaven

234.5 --> 242.37
it's mostly cloudy just take a look it's

238.079 --> 245.84900000000002
just it's a lot less shady than inside

242.37 --> 248.22
behind the curtains but it's been better

245.849 --> 251.97
the funny thing is though it's not coal

248.22 --> 253.62
at all at all it's really really mild so

251.97 --> 257.43
it's actually really nice weather

253.62 --> 261.209
despite the cloudiness and when I went

257.43 --> 263.64
for groceries I didn't even wear gloves

261.209 --> 268.099
or anything so it's really nice and mild

263.64 --> 268.099
weather yeah

272.01 --> 279.49
so if anyone at this early hour for them

277.99 --> 283.3
or this really late hour

279.49 --> 288.19
yeah struggle yeah or Asia at that

283.3 --> 304.26
region come on get on and let's have a

288.19 --> 307.69
talk about anything and everything yeah

304.26 --> 315.4
these baller figures sure do taper take

307.69 --> 320.43
up a lot of our attention don't they if

315.4 --> 323.71
it wasn't so good

320.43 --> 327.25
reflecting on us basically dismantling

323.71 --> 330.789
their their reasoning their faulty

327.25 --> 332.95
reasoning I I'd say what the Flat Earth

330.789 --> 335.62
what a lot of flat earthers in the

332.95 --> 340.24
earlier they said that is just don't

335.62 --> 343.15
ignore them because they're just trying

340.24 --> 345.27
to distract you and that is kind of the

343.15 --> 347.88
case because we are getting very

345.27 --> 352.39
distracted by these specific individuals

347.88 --> 357.90999999999997
and getting preoccupied with them and

352.39 --> 361.0
this distracts us from latching on to

357.91 --> 365.68
new things stumbling on new things so in

361.0 --> 370.15
that sense whether they even realize it

365.68 --> 372.25
or not they are performing a gatekeeping

370.15 --> 376.34999999999997
function because they are they are

372.25 --> 381.25
slowing us down at least it's not guess

376.35 --> 384.43
is that keep keeping it well it does

381.25 --> 386.979
serve the same kind of purpose it's not

384.43 --> 388.75
behind lock and key but it does keep us

386.979 --> 392.15999999999997
from progression that's exactly what a

388.75 --> 394.93
gait keeper is so you gotta realize that

392.16 --> 398.62
there's more to this world than drum

394.93 --> 405.66
position Simon Dan's and

398.62 --> 412.03000000000003
howdy oka is in all these these idiotic

405.66 --> 414.67
individuals that are just making their

412.03 --> 417.54999999999995
clowns they really are clowns and ass

414.67 --> 419.86
clowns they draw attention and they make

417.55 --> 424.12
fools of themselves and they are very

419.86 --> 427.12
amusing but they are distracting us are

424.12 --> 430.41
are they really progressing our

427.12 --> 432.82
understanding or are they simply

430.41 --> 437.61
progressing our understanding of how

432.82 --> 439.93
they are deluded how how they are

437.61 --> 445.21000000000004
because I don't think they actually

439.93 --> 447.88
contribute to real progression that we

445.21 --> 453.66999999999996
only get when we go on our own

447.88 --> 456.19
individual searches we do our own things

453.67 --> 459.43
so gotta think about that what's more

456.19 --> 461.83
important these idiots that are

459.43 --> 466.05
obviously not gonna go anywhere and

461.83 --> 466.05
they're just gonna keep on trolling or

467.25 --> 473.08
the big mysteries that are still left to

470.05 --> 478.75
us what we need to know what we really

473.08 --> 481.57
need to find out because yeah it is

478.75 --> 484.72
frustrating it's very frustrating to not

481.57 --> 489.82
have all this data that we would like to

484.72 --> 493.6
have like the the total land lay out

489.82 --> 497.05
surface interconnection a good scaled

493.6 --> 500.1
surface overview like to scale actually

497.05 --> 503.83
completely to scale even if you had to

500.1 --> 509.11
take the well let's just say the squares

503.83 --> 511.12
of the surface apart to make it properly

509.11 --> 513.28
interconnect and just say like okay it

511.12 --> 515.41
split up here because otherwise this is

513.28 --> 518.41
not going to fit but this space is

515.41 --> 523.36
actually connected and then yeah you get

518.41 --> 525.63
like a a mesh of surface area and how it

523.36 --> 528.13
is supposed to properly interconnect

525.63 --> 529.84
that is probably what we're going to end

528.13 --> 532.42
up with it's what I've been suspecting

529.84 --> 535.089
for a long time and it does get good

532.42 --> 537.88
get us closer to proving that the earth

535.089 --> 542.32
has no geometrical shape other than

537.88 --> 545.56
flats but that the spatial elements of

542.32 --> 549.089
this realm are not straightforward

545.56 --> 553.0
they're not entirely linear because

549.089 --> 559.6
things don't interconnect in a linear

553.0 --> 564.519
fashion and that's a big one it's a big

559.6 --> 566.5
stumbling block that well from my view

564.519 --> 568.269
from my perspective from my visions

566.5 --> 571.68
perspective we're gonna have to deal

568.269 --> 576.01
with that and I seem to be the only one

571.68 --> 582.2199999999999
that I know of that actually gets this

576.01 --> 588.1899999999999
so far talking about it two years yeah

582.22 --> 590.76
and people are understanding a bit

588.19 --> 598.3000000000001
better as what do I actually mean but

590.76 --> 602.949
I'm not getting any any recognition that

598.3 --> 606.76
it is something that could be getting

602.949 --> 609.699
any recognition from anyone and I don't

606.76 --> 610.6899999999999
really care because I get where that's

609.699 --> 614.68
coming from

610.69 --> 619.48
but it is kind of disappointing because

614.68 --> 625.42
I I really do think that the earth is

619.48 --> 629.589
not simply a disk a flat disk it's know

625.42 --> 632.079
the lands be the known map of the land

629.589 --> 636.0600000000001
surface you have to look at the grid you

632.079 --> 640.5999999999999
have to look at the distances per square

636.06 --> 644.319
it's not the scale even that thing is

640.6 --> 650.0790000000001
not the scale it's it's the same [ __ ]

644.319 --> 652.4799999999999
so yeah we don't have a model because we

650.079 --> 655.029
don't have a literal representation of

652.48 --> 658.63
the surface of the earth we can't

655.029 --> 660.55
represent the surface of the earth in a

658.63 --> 663.49
literal fashion because we don't know

660.55 --> 667.06
how it is in a literal fashion we only

663.49 --> 672.47
have the projection based

667.06 --> 675.4699999999999
surfaces and we don't know how correct

672.47 --> 678.35
it even is it's just a creation that is

675.47 --> 680.4200000000001
presented to us can be approached from

678.35 --> 684.35
many angles from any perspectives from

680.42 --> 689.12
any projections but we don't know the

684.35 --> 693.5
total truth of it we have no way to

689.12 --> 702.16
personally confirm it as of yet though

693.5 --> 705.56
there is a lot of data but how reliable

702.16 --> 708.02
is are these channels of this data

705.56 --> 710.27
because hey if you want to keep control

708.02 --> 712.63
of the world you will have to keep

710.27 --> 716.3
control of all these scanning equipment

712.63 --> 718.81
that can represent the world basically

716.3 --> 722.27
just like NASA controls the

718.81 --> 725.4499999999999
representations of the high view above

722.27 --> 727.25
they can never show it as it is because

725.45 --> 730.3100000000001
that's to be Photoshop has to be

727.25 --> 732.29
remember so with any other type of

730.31 --> 736.8699999999999
surface and careful surface scanning

732.29 --> 739.25
data collection would that just be

736.87 --> 742.85
totally available without any

739.25 --> 744.98
interference without any like okay

742.85 --> 747.38
before we give them this data we have to

744.98 --> 752.0
properly adapt it to the projection that

747.38 --> 753.73
is allowed to be put out that's why we

752.0 --> 758.39
have to do it ourselves

753.73 --> 760.49
really do it ourselves and then don't

758.39 --> 764.75
let anything be done with it don't let

760.49 --> 767.84
it be worked on but work out the surface

764.75 --> 769.49
interconnections like a puzzle get all

767.84 --> 773.6
the puzzle pieces together you know how

769.49 --> 776.75
eats each scan area would interconnect

773.6 --> 778.82
you know the scale of it what you're

776.75 --> 781.61
looking at well put it all together and

778.82 --> 787.0600000000001
see what you're getting see how that can

781.61 --> 789.23
work and what are the typical

787.06 --> 790.91
non-linearity anomalies that you're

789.23 --> 792.83
going to be encountering what are deemed

790.91 --> 796.1899999999999
the mysteries that we're going to be

792.83 --> 799.6600000000001
bumping into with this or is it really

796.19 --> 806.5400000000001
just gonna fit like a giant

799.66 --> 808.1
rectangle or disc after all there's only

806.54 --> 811.31
one way to find out and that's to

808.1 --> 814.97
actually get raw surface scans ocean

811.31 --> 821.5
floors land surfaces and put them all

814.97 --> 823.63
together it's just raw data compilation

821.5 --> 830.38
yeah

823.63 --> 833.39
so that is what I that is really what we

830.38 --> 835.66
what given would would give us so much

833.39 --> 840.37
more to work with

835.66 --> 843.73
to actually build more to build higher

840.37 --> 849.68
to gain a deeper insight to solve and

843.73 --> 852.62
solve puzzles like is there a dome a

849.68 --> 855.31
physical literal dome or is there a flat

852.62 --> 858.16
top or isn't there anything this will

855.31 --> 861.29
the the knowledge of the total surface

858.16 --> 863.6899999999999
at least let's just say East the West

861.29 --> 866.3
and as far north and south as we can get

863.69 --> 869.87
and putting it all together will reveal

866.3 --> 873.68
so much of the nature of the world once

869.87 --> 878.09
we get the true surface layout it'll

873.68 --> 882.77
tell us is is it enclosed is there a

878.09 --> 884.9
loop and yeah all these things whatever

882.77 --> 887.99
we're gonna find it's gonna exclude

884.9 --> 889.0699999999999
certain options and narrow down what the

887.99 --> 891.53
possibilities are

889.07 --> 893.5100000000001
that's why we need them so we can

891.53 --> 896.42
actually establish like okay these were

893.51 --> 899.09
the options it's one of these two now

896.42 --> 905.4399999999999
because these three can be possible so

899.09 --> 909.26
what do these models allow for possible

905.44 --> 913.7600000000001
causes of the presumed gravity like is

909.26 --> 918.14
it electrostatic a thing is that even

913.76 --> 923.09
possible in like a non dome non disc

918.14 --> 925.43
shaped thing for example or is there

923.09 --> 927.8000000000001
something else anyway as soon as you

925.43 --> 929.66
figure this out and probably even on the

927.8 --> 931.67
way of doing it there will be a lot of

929.66 --> 935.4499999999999
new inspiration as

931.67 --> 938.39
- taking more steps ahead

935.45 --> 939.95
beyond results because you're gonna be

938.39 --> 941.84
focusing on and people are gonna be

939.95 --> 943.85
focusing on it if we're if it's known

941.84 --> 946.37
that this is being done people are gonna

943.85 --> 948.08
get very enthusiastic about it but yeah

946.37 --> 954.92
we've got it we got to get there first

948.08 --> 956.75
so yeah and when we get there first when

954.92 --> 961.91
we actually get do it there to do that

956.75 --> 964.97
then we will also get one step further

961.91 --> 967.3399999999999
into stall solving one of the greatest

964.97 --> 970.88
mystery of our world and that is what

967.34 --> 974.72
causes the heavenly bodies what causes

970.88 --> 979.16
the Sun in the moon where what causes

974.72 --> 982.22
the holographic apparitions and the day

979.16 --> 984.23
and night light cycles where is that

982.22 --> 987.8000000000001
coming from what can be causing that is

984.23 --> 991.73
it like a critical and like an energy

987.8 --> 996.0799999999999
we've work in its critical overlap there

991.73 --> 1000.12
is light coming into existence because

996.08 --> 1003.46
of some high tension thing or whatever

1000.12 --> 1005.35
cuz a if you know the world set up if

1003.46 --> 1008.0500000000001
you know more about that then you can

1005.35 --> 1011.23
draw conclusions as to what type of

1008.05 --> 1014.29
shapes what resonance is potentially

1011.23 --> 1017.08
possible what are the possible patterns

1014.29 --> 1022.23
for energies in the world to manifest

1017.08 --> 1025.78
and to maintain and what would typically

1022.23 --> 1029.89
possibly drive them by the shape you can

1025.78 --> 1032.71
pinpoint a the introductory source of

1029.89 --> 1034.7800000000002
energy potentially you can pin you can

1032.71 --> 1036.73
figure out where it's coming from where

1034.78 --> 1040.48
it should be coming through to the

1036.73 --> 1042.46
shapes all see that is why it is so

1040.48 --> 1046.09
important there's so much more we can

1042.46 --> 1050.14
discover about the world by knowing the

1046.09 --> 1053.32
confines so it really is important to

1050.14 --> 1056.5600000000002
know this and not and really know it and

1053.32 --> 1063.6
not leave it to gatekeepers to tell us

1056.56 --> 1063.6
what it is right Cheers

1063.67 --> 1083.5700000000002
people rolling in Sean Hutton and dank

1075.97 --> 1088.8500000000001
Simon Grabovski matrix media hello see

1083.57 --> 1093.6499999999999
the make mm not good to have y'all I

1088.85 --> 1096.7099999999998
hope you're interested in what my dreams

1093.65 --> 1099.25
of the future what we should be doing

1096.71 --> 1099.25
and why

1108.86 --> 1111.61
so

1125.57 --> 1133.61
it's fascinating the things now

1129.26 --> 1135.25
happening in in the mainstream as it

1133.61 --> 1140.11
were in the geopolitical situation

1135.25 --> 1140.11
everything that's surrounding Arabia and

1140.17 --> 1148.03
the now judicial strike back against the

1145.7 --> 1150.44
deep state lawyer

1148.03 --> 1153.1399999999999
situation in the Russian Gate and all

1150.44 --> 1157.04
that crap that everybody including me it

1153.14 --> 1160.8200000000002
was very integral into it through my

1157.04 --> 1163.76
visions knowing about it still it's like

1160.82 --> 1165.5
oh my god she's never gonna stop it's so

1163.76 --> 1168.1
annoying it's getting annoying it's too

1165.5 --> 1174.8
intentionally tension grabby but it is

1168.1 --> 1177.3799999999999
really it is real at least partially so

1174.8 --> 1179.75
there is stuff going on and I think that

1177.38 --> 1182.18
like there's gonna be a big switch

1179.75 --> 1184.13
pretty quickly I'm kind of nervous about

1182.18 --> 1187.97
it because of what could potentially be

1184.13 --> 1191.8100000000002
triggered because of that but I think

1187.97 --> 1197.15
that the deep state is pretty much gone

1191.81 --> 1204.74
now full the pawns are gonna fall funny

1197.15 --> 1208.3100000000002
thing is is tied in with him again with

1204.74 --> 1212.1200000000001
McCain and Bush I remember that I

1208.31 --> 1217.3
remember them dying and that was

1212.12 --> 1217.3
basically the last those were the last

1217.39 --> 1224.1200000000001
the fall before it all collapsed because

1221.09 --> 1227.4199999999998
of the interim interrelations between

1224.12 --> 1231.4399999999998
all these high people and their

1227.42 --> 1233.3600000000001
connections so yeah I think it really is

1231.44 --> 1238.46
[ __ ] is gonna happen and we're all gonna

1233.36 --> 1241.07
be looking like woah okay it's not just

1238.46 --> 1245.42
blah blah blah anymore now what's gonna

1241.07 --> 1246.95
happen now so anyway yeah people money

1245.42 --> 1249.95
like you're probably gonna think this

1246.95 --> 1254.14
all's really really stupid

1249.95 --> 1257.63
politics is stupid guess that most of it

1254.14 --> 1263.5600000000002
especially if you look who are

1257.63 --> 1268.7
people in politics Maxine Waters

1263.56 --> 1271.79
brilliant it's like yeah you like how

1268.7 --> 1278.8600000000001
could she not be a representative of the

1271.79 --> 1284.42
people she is exactly like the average

1278.86 --> 1285.8899999999999
person who we kind of don't really want

1284.42 --> 1288.29
government but yeah she is a

1285.89 --> 1293.72
representative in that sense literally

1288.29 --> 1298.93
but yeah politics hey it's so stupid and

1293.72 --> 1303.47
it's made to be stupid because that

1298.93 --> 1305.48
draws in the stupid people you can get a

1303.47 --> 1309.02
grip on something and feel like they are

1305.48 --> 1311.21
contributing and the smart people are

1309.02 --> 1314.12
just so freakin annoyed they just don't

1311.21 --> 1317.45
get involved unless they have some self

1314.12 --> 1321.29
interest or whatever in it and they're

1317.45 --> 1324.8
not gonna be inspired to get involved I

1321.29 --> 1326.69
think I guess maybe that's an overt in

1324.8 --> 1331.34
relations I should be doing that after

1326.69 --> 1333.38
all my speeches about that but politics

1331.34 --> 1336.3799999999999
I don't know in a general sense I think

1333.38 --> 1339.0500000000002
that a general strategy for politics is

1336.38 --> 1341.48
to make it as annoying as possible so

1339.05 --> 1343.49
people don't pay attention and don't get

1341.48 --> 1344.18
too critical about the details of what's

1343.49 --> 1346.79
happening

1344.18 --> 1350.93
it's a demotivation policy make it

1346.79 --> 1354.26
annoying because they are controlling

1350.93 --> 1356.93
stuff and they are their representatives

1354.26 --> 1359.24
but yet they know everyone then they can

1356.93 --> 1366.98
just do whatever their agenda is without

1359.24 --> 1370.28
too much interruption so anyway good

1366.98 --> 1376.13
morning plane Dave just calm that

1370.28 --> 1378.2
chocolate seein my girl so if any of you

1376.13 --> 1383.7700000000002

1388.88 --> 1392.88

1390.9 --> 1399.71
my skype address is in the description

1392.88 --> 1403.2600000000002
box below and just add me and let's chat

1399.71 --> 1409.02
usually the next day I will give you the

1403.26 --> 1411.03
link to try it out and it doesn't even

1409.02 --> 1413.07
matter if you're a baller as long as

1411.03 --> 1418.83
you're not gonna be a toll troll about

1413.07 --> 1423.45
it and have a an open intellectually

1418.83 --> 1428.57
honest and gentlemanly gentle lady but

1423.45 --> 1430.799
ya attitude and not get all educating

1428.57 --> 1432.36
because I don't want that

1430.799 --> 1434.01
you're gonna persist that I'm just gonna

1432.36 --> 1437.4599999999998
kick you and never invite you again

1434.01 --> 1452.01
but yeah you probably already know that

1437.46 --> 1459.27
about me so I totally missed out on my

1452.01 --> 1462.39
latest latest hangout it's it's one and

1459.27 --> 1464.34
a half hour roughly really curious as to

1462.39 --> 1468.48
what it is but yeah I haven't seen it

1464.34 --> 1470.07
more than half a minute of it so I still

1468.48 --> 1472.8600000000001
have to catch up there are so many

1470.07 --> 1475.95
things happening I can barely keep track

1472.86 --> 1482.07
even of the people that I am really

1475.95 --> 1484.0800000000002
interested in how can you keep track of

1482.07 --> 1488.58
all this stuff and even make something

1484.08 --> 1494.6589999999999
yourself it's a really tough time

1488.58 --> 1506.039
consuming energy consuming job this

1494.659 --> 1508.44
network working mizuki so anyone in chat

1506.039 --> 1511.9089999999999
have any questions I'd love to answer it

1508.44 --> 1511.909
any type of questions

1526.0 --> 1529.24
[Music]

1532.8 --> 1542.02
all right dank

1535.71 --> 1543.76
what is your take in cue you have to

1542.02 --> 1545.62
unlike me exactly what you mean because

1543.76 --> 1550.15
cue as far as I know

1545.62 --> 1553.1799999999998
oh wait like you anon well people have

1550.15 --> 1556.69
been saying that's a LARP and if even

1553.18 --> 1561.3300000000002
Alex Jones starts to say that then you

1556.69 --> 1561.3300000000002
can be pretty damn well sure that it is

1561.78 --> 1570.97
so yeah it's totally fake and the things

1566.77 --> 1574.3
that I've heard of it it's just how do

1570.97 --> 1576.7
you say it more typical new agey false

1574.3 --> 1585.19
promise approach so it seems like it

1576.7 --> 1586.99
could be a covert Democrat or how do you

1585.19 --> 1591.52
say yeah Democrat Party driven

1586.99 --> 1595.6
intelligence see operation like so yeah

1591.52 --> 1600.04
something to get a new momentum thing

1595.6 --> 1604.6899999999998
but it's not really working out it yeah

1600.04 --> 1607.69
I think it's foiled basically and a lot

1604.69 --> 1610.8400000000001
of things are being foiled right in the

1607.69 --> 1613.03
but they're being cut off that things

1610.84 --> 1616.87
are really changing like the deeps that

1613.03 --> 1618.91
has so many tentacles but they are now

1616.87 --> 1621.6899999999998
really getting cornered they are not

1618.91 --> 1626.3100000000002
really getting cut off in all their

1621.69 --> 1632.44
operations it's starting to fall slowly

1626.31 --> 1634.27
like dominoes but slowly this is going

1632.44 --> 1637.5900000000001
to ramp up so I think that cueing on is

1634.27 --> 1641.92
fake it would have been interesting but

1637.59 --> 1643.81
things are not turning out as said and

1641.92 --> 1648.0700000000002
characters are not who they are

1643.81 --> 1654.3
portrayed to be by this route so I don't

1648.07 --> 1654.3
think it's real see other questions

1661.94 --> 1674.69
right it's always odd when I get these

1665.82 --> 1679.739
weird compliments from from ballers like

1674.69 --> 1682.739
Jessica I just put in there I have to

1679.739 --> 1685.249
say you're the realistic flat earther on

1682.739 --> 1695.58
the globe Thanks

1685.249 --> 1698.8990000000001
that means so much to me but anyway I

1695.58 --> 1698.899
still appreciate it

1700.429 --> 1708.8400000000001
although it is kind of funny to me

1702.929 --> 1713.0700000000002
for obvious reasons anyway let's not get

1708.84 --> 1715.85
it all into two deeper arguments about

1713.07 --> 1715.85
that kind of thing

1720.109 --> 1724.739
anything else guys any more of these

1722.639 --> 1727.649
questions come on bring them in roll

1724.739 --> 1737.429
them in you know if it's a good question

1727.649 --> 1738.899
I will answer it as I always do the

1737.429 --> 1742.95
categories I'm just gonna be talking

1738.899 --> 1745.9799999999998
about Netflix again okay so been

1742.95 --> 1748.71
watching a lot of that a lot of serious

1745.98 --> 1755.19
new series and all continuations of all

1748.71 --> 1759.059
series simultaneously so I've been

1755.19 --> 1764.22
watching Star Trek discovery yay

1759.059 --> 1770.869
I like missed the last few episodes so

1764.22 --> 1770.869
yeah it is such an amazing series like

1772.159 --> 1778.3400000000001
it's just really good I like it it's

1776.389 --> 1780.7199999999998
amazing how it works

1778.34 --> 1783.83
characters are really interesting and I

1780.72 --> 1788.58
also very much like the show setup of

1783.83 --> 1791.389
Star Trek discovery because it is it is

1788.58 --> 1791.389
split up

1791.81 --> 1798.72
like the like a military type

1796.07 --> 1802.58
strategical and diplomatic approach

1798.72 --> 1806.09
thing and then there is the science

1802.58 --> 1809.82
departments and engineering and it's

1806.09 --> 1814.1399999999999
very very elaborate that side and very

1809.82 --> 1818.25
interesting and they do so much cool

1814.14 --> 1820.6200000000001
stuff like Dexter's Laboratory high-tech

1818.25 --> 1822.99
[ __ ] and I love it

1820.62 --> 1826.11
I love that show it is so freakin

1822.99 --> 1828.21
amazing I don't know it's just I'm

1826.11 --> 1834.12
stunned by it I really like the

1828.21 --> 1836.6000000000001
characters I like even how yeah I like

1834.12 --> 1840.11
how they're like gay relations in there

1836.6 --> 1843.6599999999999
but it's not disgusting it's just really

1840.11 --> 1847.7099999999998
real love it's like the real relation

1843.66 --> 1850.92
not just and it's real I like it I

1847.71 --> 1853.8
really like the series it's very

1850.92 --> 1855.6000000000001
inspired by it once again so yeah

1853.8 --> 1857.84
science fiction what can you do with it

1855.6 --> 1861.8
a lot it's one of the greatest

1857.84 --> 1868.3799999999999
storytelling mediums ever invented and

1861.8 --> 1872.04
it's a great contributor to imagination

1868.38 --> 1876.0900000000001
based culture given culture in my in my

1872.04 --> 1882.8999999999999
personal opinion so yeah a reason for me

1876.09 --> 1885.87
to not go all or book-burning on

1882.9 --> 1889.47
everything globe not allergic to it I

1885.87 --> 1897.81
think it's okay just gotta be realistic

1889.47 --> 1903.09
about it that's all anyway oh god no no

1897.81 --> 1905.37
don't think so Jess come then and by the

1903.09 --> 1908.85
way yeah you are gonna have to add me on

1905.37 --> 1912.2099999999998
skype because that's how I do the link

1908.85 --> 1913.77
that's it so but I don't know I don't

1912.21 --> 1918.39
really feel like getting you on right

1913.77 --> 1921.65
now I'll take chocolate sayin though if

1918.39 --> 1921.65
he's up for it

1922.85 --> 1924.85
Oh

1931.63 --> 1940.0700000000002
yeah chocolate Satan is asking a

1934.22 --> 1942.71
question to jazz I'm gonna hijack how

1940.07 --> 1945.46
does the Sun work have no idea I can't

1942.71 --> 1948.89
comment on it wouldn't you like to know

1945.46 --> 1953.98
do you really like to know what what

1948.89 --> 1960.89
would happen if we got permission the

1953.98 --> 1966.89
free fly with some serious devices and

1960.89 --> 1968.21
actually try to approach the Sun see

1966.89 --> 1970.3700000000001
what happens even with some

1968.21 --> 1973.43
technological precautions like serious

1970.37 --> 1975.35
heat shields or whatever let's say that

1973.43 --> 1978.38
it could be possible to get really close

1975.35 --> 1979.9099999999999
and you would burn or who knows what

1978.38 --> 1981.6200000000001
we're gonna find maybe like when you

1979.91 --> 1984.3700000000001
approach it you end up like in another

1981.62 --> 1987.9199999999998
freaking dimension there's nothing I

1984.37 --> 1992.84
don't know it seemed too much fantasy

1987.92 --> 1998.74
stuff but I want to know I really want

1992.84 --> 2002.29
the definitive answer is it purely

1998.74 --> 2007.59
holographic or is the holographic nature

2002.29 --> 2007.59
of it an extra dimensional side effect

2007.71 --> 2014.5900000000001
because ya probably start to imagine

2011.47 --> 2016.63
that like how 3d interacts with 2d into

2014.59 --> 2019.57
the 2d it's really weird and like how

2016.63 --> 2021.5500000000002
can it be well maybe it is freaking 4th

2019.57 --> 2025.1499999999999
dimensional whatever you want to call it

2021.55 --> 2027.61
six fifth dimensional and it is directly

2025.15 --> 2029.98
light based interacting with our world

2027.61 --> 2031.78
maybe there is a way to find out let's

2029.98 --> 2037.1100000000001
approach it let's see if it is

2031.78 --> 2042.0
definitively at the edge of vision

2037.11 --> 2042.0
everywhere that's what I want to know

2051.07 --> 2054.65
yeah not you know the southern

2053.78 --> 2057.8300000000004
hemisphere

2054.65 --> 2062.75
it's simply south of the equator that's

2057.83 --> 2067.0699999999997
why that is it's not a hemisphere it's

2062.75 --> 2070.4
just I guess you could call the

2067.07 --> 2076.03
equatorial South then you have the

2070.4 --> 2076.03
equatorial north and those are the two

2076.06 --> 2086.48
sub regions in our realm region that's

2084.2 --> 2099.95
how I call it's not a hemisphere really

2086.48 --> 2102.22
oh dear no simulation dweller so let's

2099.95 --> 2102.22
see

2117.54 --> 2129.6
ya know I'm not from Argentina cause

2127.29 --> 2130.14
then I will talk a little bit more like

2129.6 --> 2135.99
this

2130.14 --> 2140.1299999999997
I can do it properly and overdoing it

2135.99 --> 2143.1899999999996
making it to Spanish I guess but now my

2140.13 --> 2148.8900000000003
accent is not like that it's really a

2143.19 --> 2154.26
very moderate West European accent very

2148.89 --> 2156.7799999999997
very modernized moderate so it's not

2154.26 --> 2164.28
South American at all they have very

2156.78 --> 2171.27
different tones they apply that are most

2164.28 --> 2183.44
the Mediterranean in nature and I am NOT

2171.27 --> 2190.2599999999998
it no in Dracula speaks very differently

2183.44 --> 2193.1
as morally Slavic approach that is

2190.26 --> 2193.1000000000004
Dracula

2193.4 --> 2201.81
now when I talk more South American or

2197.25 --> 2207.36
Spanish that's a different sound it's a

2201.81 --> 2209.19
different soundscape both yeah I do

2207.36 --> 2213.69
voices all the time it's I'm a game

2209.19 --> 2216.54
master in the game and yeah man I you

2213.69 --> 2221.07
need a freaking repertoire for that you

2216.54 --> 2223.65
like me like on the go you like the most

2221.07 --> 2227.9700000000003
problematic is when you need different

2223.65 --> 2229.9500000000003
voices for the same cultural group

2227.97 --> 2232.5899999999997
because you're gonna find like you got

2229.95 --> 2235.4399999999996
to figure out okay what typical subtypes

2232.59 --> 2238.2000000000003
of characters and their voices are gonna

2235.44 --> 2240.87
be in this type of region like what is

2238.2 --> 2244.7999999999997
their types oh my god of a fictional

2240.87 --> 2247.5299999999997
region so yeah I need I try things out I

2244.8 --> 2249.92
also flu sometimes I'm like okay this is

2247.53 --> 2253.8190000000004
not how it sounds and this is now

2249.92 --> 2257.78
I have to change voices sometimes but

2253.819 --> 2261.02
man so many types that you're that I'm

2257.78 --> 2267.02
applying in that game like any type of

2261.02 --> 2274.16
action from Irish to British or Spanish

2267.02 --> 2277.13
or Italian or corrosion but not really

2274.16 --> 2281.7799999999997
Russian with two Slovak or poof man you

2277.13 --> 2289.28
could go any direction and even female

2281.78 --> 2292.579
voices yeah problem furnaces and weird

2289.28 --> 2294.049
little creatures and Dragons but yeah

2292.579 --> 2300.079
you have to prepare to do that properly

2294.049 --> 2303.89
like the low voices and whatever and not

2300.079 --> 2305.9300000000003
have a cold very important detail but

2303.89 --> 2308.48
yeah good thing I never have a cold I

2305.93 --> 2310.43
haven't had a cold in like a long

2308.48 --> 2313.309
freakin time very happy about it almost

2310.43 --> 2320.47
two years now where is it one half year

2313.309 --> 2320.4700000000003
something like that but no no cold here

2322.24 --> 2328.54
anyway just screwing around a little

2325.79 --> 2328.54
voices here

2339.93 --> 2353.91
you know I'm not the Mark Taylor type

2342.18 --> 2357.8689999999997
that's jazz are you drunk again because

2353.91 --> 2361.3489999999997
I am in a cult

2357.869 --> 2363.3900000000003
that's literally an insult to me like

2361.349 --> 2366.63
know if I had any involvement in the

2363.39 --> 2369.0
cult I would be the freakin leader of it

2366.63 --> 2371.9300000000003
and I'm not because that's not our type

2369.0 --> 2377.01
of responsibility that I want I just

2371.93 --> 2380.3089999999997
rather be relied upon individual in a

2377.01 --> 2385.5200000000004
group of wise annealer nning individuals

2380.309 --> 2388.23
that by their knowledge and by necessity

2385.52 --> 2391.079
because of the world opposing knowledge

2388.23 --> 2395.16
naturally would just have like a

2391.079 --> 2400.8590000000004
brotherhood or brother/sisterhood type

2395.16 --> 2405.18
of set up a bond that's what I like

2400.859 --> 2410.97
I don't like mind control I like

2405.18 --> 2413.8489999999997
inspiring I like really good ideas and I

2410.97 --> 2417.2099999999996
like people that are good at explaining

2413.849 --> 2419.46
things but I don't like mind control and

2417.21 --> 2421.95
I don't like dogma and lies and that is

2419.46 --> 2425.18
what a cult usually rests upon it's a

2421.95 --> 2430.529
trick it is the cult is to step away

2425.18 --> 2432.839
from critical thinking it's not you're

2430.529 --> 2435.869
not free in a company you're not free to

2432.839 --> 2440.0099999999998
think your own way really not really

2435.869 --> 2442.6800000000003
rarely so no jazakallah I'm not in a

2440.01 --> 2444.8590000000004
freakin cult it's projection you're the

2442.68 --> 2450.1499999999996
in the cult the globe freakin cult

2444.859 --> 2461.7599999999998
exactly like Scylla Selene Selene alien

2450.15 --> 2464.19
is a so yeah yeah it's a cult and it's a

2461.76 --> 2466.829
religion because yeah it has an

2464.19 --> 2472.25
institutions it is funding and it has

2466.829 --> 2472.25
media and it has a lot of power

2472.94 --> 2479.88
yeah jazakallah I am free I am free in

2476.22 --> 2482.0699999999997
my mind I am free

2479.88 --> 2486.11
absolutely I'm still in the society and

2482.07 --> 2493.98
I am limited in my freedom in that sense

2486.11 --> 2502.83
but as a spirit as an individual I am

2493.98 --> 2503.88
free to to follow the path that I see

2502.83 --> 2509.0
fit

2503.88 --> 2511.8900000000003
yeah and that's freedom yeah I am and

2509.0 --> 2516.3
the more you see the more paths

2511.89 --> 2520.1099999999997
you see so absolutely like knowledge

2516.3 --> 2522.1200000000003
it just gives more freedom problem is it

2520.11 --> 2525.33
also tends to give more responsibility

2522.12 --> 2529.5
and yeah if other people don't even see

2525.33 --> 2532.35
it's there then many people will discard

2529.5 --> 2535.47
that responsibility because it's just a

2532.35 --> 2544.56
burden I try not to do that made a

2535.47 --> 2546.7799999999997
chocolate thanks for joining them yeah

2544.56 --> 2555.56
doing good I think we got a another

2546.78 --> 2555.5600000000004
drunk Jessa calm that chat yeah I know

2555.65 --> 2563.76
it seems like it you started early with

2560.76 --> 2569.55
his hemispheres and all that oh my god

2563.76 --> 2571.5
it's too early for you guys can you hear

2569.55 --> 2576.1800000000003
me okay yeah I can hear you fine

2571.5 --> 2578.97
I'm just still looking in jet there's a

2576.18 --> 2595.58
chorus follow that that sounds like a

2578.97 --> 2600.0899999999997
direction oh oh no where you are that's

2595.58 --> 2602.6
1345 so yeah I started the show an hour

2600.09 --> 2602.6000000000004
earlier

2603.17 --> 2616.91
yeah I got 50 more minutes and then the

2606.41 --> 2620.81
debates are gonna start so yeah it's

2616.91 --> 2624.17
Monday I was that stack Monday 20 those

2620.81 --> 2625.97
the 8 o'clock all right everything's now

2624.17 --> 2628.04
we're on mm-hmm

2625.97 --> 2631.73
so I'm now doing that as well I have no

2628.04 --> 2635.41
objection to doing it so and I like it

2631.73 --> 2635.41
better than when the shows are overlaps

2645.55 --> 2652.3100000000004
yeah it was okay

2648.74 --> 2656.08
in watching a lot of Netflix it's like

2652.31 --> 2658.25
watching literally three series

2656.08 --> 2660.65
simultaneously now not literally but

2658.25 --> 2663.32
like one episode of this then like

2660.65 --> 2665.33
another another in like okay like

2663.32 --> 2666.8
bumping into another one like oh I want

2665.33 --> 2670.0099999999998
to know what this is just watching a

2666.8 --> 2672.4700000000003
half of the first now what is this and

2670.01 --> 2677.2400000000002
like oh my god this old series I didn't

2672.47 --> 2680.1499999999996
know that it was also Netflix and that's

2677.24 --> 2685.6099999999997
so freakin much on there so yeah it's I

2680.15 --> 2687.86
got wizards and knights and space

2685.61 --> 2692.84
battles all over the place basically and

2687.86 --> 2695.57
time machines and aliens and there's so

2692.84 --> 2697.7200000000003
many of these type of series she's crazy

2695.57 --> 2703.6000000000004
you know

2697.72 --> 2707.87
everything you could possibly want yeah

2703.6 --> 2711.62
and and they're pretty decent series

2707.87 --> 2713.7999999999997
it's like pretty good yeah it's really

2711.62 --> 2716.9
bumped into anything that says like ah

2713.8 --> 2721.25
that's so sloppy or that's so lame no

2716.9 --> 2727.07
it's everything is pretty much at a good

2721.25 --> 2729.92
standard for the the theme or the the

2727.07 --> 2734.15
setting of the show everything is pretty

2729.92 --> 2735.32
good some they have this one [ __ ] you

2734.15 --> 2737.6
had a one series of thought of a

2735.32 --> 2739.25
slightly boring I guess

2737.6 --> 2743.68
but maybe that's just because I wasn't

2739.25 --> 2746.45
the proper target audience but yeah

2743.68 --> 2750.2
quality and content wise is pretty good

2746.45 --> 2754.43
acting is all pretty good anyway enough

2750.2 --> 2756.4399999999996
the advertising please yeah and this

2754.43 --> 2768.8599999999997
area that I thought was slightly boring

2756.44 --> 2774.56
was so again forgetting the name was my

2768.86 --> 2780.65
favorite oh yeah lost in space it's kind

2774.56 --> 2785.24
of a family target audience space was

2780.65 --> 2787.34
like old lost in space wasn't that like

2785.24 --> 2791.06
the old show and they remade it

2787.34 --> 2795.44
yeah well it's one of it's based on one

2791.06 --> 2797.45
of the most famous science fiction space

2795.44 --> 2798.29
movies ever made one of the

2797.45 --> 2800.66
black-and-whites

2798.29 --> 2804.14
and there was another one in the 90s

2800.66 --> 2807.8599999999997
that also was based on that it was yeah

2804.14 --> 2808.8799999999997
okay and this one is also based on that

2807.86 --> 2811.55
concept yeah

2808.88 --> 2816.4700000000003
there's some very annoying [ __ ] in there

2811.55 --> 2818.6600000000003
as well but like the annoying then is

2816.47 --> 2820.52
counteracted to get with pretty cool

2818.66 --> 2821.8999999999996
stuff so it is kind of cool and then

2820.52 --> 2825.41
it's kind of annoying and it's cool

2821.9 --> 2827.7200000000003
again yeah I think there's probably

2825.41 --> 2829.85
gonna be a lot of people that that will

2827.72 --> 2837.62
like it I didn't like it so much

2829.85 --> 2840.43
personally they just cancelled they just

2837.62 --> 2847.3399999999997
canceled all the normal shows really

2840.43 --> 2849.91
yeah freaking why because I have no idea

2847.34 --> 2849.9100000000003
man

2852.17 --> 2857.03
I heard that Disney was buying Marvel up

2854.87 --> 2862.64
or something maybe I got that wrong but

2857.03 --> 2864.2900000000004
been hearing them so yeah I think well

2862.64 --> 2865.1299999999997
there you go I think that's already

2864.29 --> 2867.64
happened

2865.13 --> 2871.28
well then they're basically yeah just

2867.64 --> 2874.73
being greedy bastards as usual

2871.28 --> 2876.94
like nobody a marvel knew it's it's a

2874.73 --> 2880.1
really good opportunity for DC those

2876.94 --> 2883.88
first day they cancelled Iron Fist and

2880.1 --> 2885.77
what's the other one uh Luke Cage right

2883.88 --> 2888.62
I didn't hear anything about Jessica

2885.77 --> 2890.93
Jones but they cancelled those those

2888.62 --> 2893.96
shows and then I was like ah right then

2890.93 --> 2895.94
that sucks because yeah they were pretty

2893.96 --> 2898.85
good even though iron fist wasn't great

2895.94 --> 2902.42
was it as good as the other ones but

2898.85 --> 2905.72
daredevil was obviously the best one all

2902.42 --> 2907.55
right no there's no way they got

2905.72 --> 2910.0099999999998
cancelled air that were they cancelled

2907.55 --> 2923.3300000000004
it like what the hell's going on here

2910.01 --> 2935.3300000000004
then you're into like comic heroes and

2923.33 --> 2940.94
stuff right Wow big comic book geek well

2935.33 --> 2942.92
you're lucky guy because there's I read

2940.94 --> 2945.77
yeah well it's cool because I actually

2942.92 --> 2949.1
read comments when I was a kid so I I

2945.77 --> 2952.0099999999998
know about these characters as opposed

2949.1 --> 2955.19
to people who just know about them

2952.01 --> 2959.0
because of the movies I know them

2955.19 --> 2964.48
because of the cartoon series like the

2959.0 --> 2967.85
90s like the extra stuff you are five

2964.48 --> 2976.97
Wow soon as I started reading I started

2967.85 --> 2979.52
reading reading I started reading as a

2976.97 --> 2982.4599999999996
good beat yes for the pictures of

2979.52 --> 2986.66
volcanoes and things but that's one of

2982.46 --> 2989.09
the reasons why it had that i did have

2986.66 --> 2991.3999999999996
kind of an affinity to space because you

2989.09 --> 2996.5
know in comic books you know space is

2991.4 --> 2999.4900000000002
real and all that so you know sometimes

2996.5 --> 3003.92
I do watch the movies now and I'm like

2999.49 --> 3009.41
okay I've got to take it as a cool story

3003.92 --> 3012.319
I got a spaceship to the side kind of

3009.41 --> 3016.839
you know well it's really annoying when

3012.319 --> 3020.63
they're like icon worshipping in sci-fi

3016.839 --> 3022.97
like oh my god we can't all the moon

3020.63 --> 3026.15
landings is so important historical

3022.97 --> 3028.0099999999998
moment we can't lessen that kind of

3026.15 --> 3029.7400000000002
thing when they're like oh and all that

3028.01 --> 3032.9
that's really freaking annoying but

3029.74 --> 3037.8489999999997
beside that stuff I think it's pretty

3032.9 --> 3040.67
awesome mostly because it's just

3037.849 --> 3042.559
pragmatic it's a fictional universe and

3040.67 --> 3046.13
they're just people can be pragmatic

3042.559 --> 3049.1600000000003
about it but yeah the the I can

3046.13 --> 3052.01
worshipping that's really annoying they

3049.16 --> 3056.48
got like a whole but Copernicus mm-hmm

3052.01 --> 3062.9900000000002
the typical globe or crap when you go

3056.48 --> 3065.2690000000002
into history in science fiction like

3062.99 --> 3068.39
gravity was proven by noting first

3065.269 --> 3077.0
indeed Wambach's like yeah it does get

3068.39 --> 3079.519
rancic reference it's science fiction

3077.0 --> 3088.94
story so these stars are exactly where

3079.519 --> 3091.2099999999996
they should be in science fiction it's

3088.94 --> 3096.19
really crazy when you think about it

3091.21 --> 3100.339
like especially when you're waking up

3096.19 --> 3102.109
it's like oh my god like so that's all

3100.339 --> 3103.849
science fiction and they're telling it

3102.109 --> 3116.509
as true and we see it in science fiction

3103.849 --> 3119.75
constantly it's really surreal can't get

3116.509 --> 3124.099
away from it at all I don't know when it

3119.75 --> 3125.92
comes to fantasy stuff no can't get away

3124.099 --> 3128.809
from it

3125.92 --> 3131.9500000000003
but yeah when historical things are

3128.809 --> 3134.809
involved they always love to get the

3131.95 --> 3148.75
like oh my god so oh there's this

3134.809 --> 3151.5190000000002
mystical knowledge about the blue that's

3148.75 --> 3155.5
that does rub me the wrong way sometimes

3151.519 --> 3158.0589999999997
now I love it

3155.5 --> 3161.059
lieutenant funny because there's there

3158.059 --> 3163.3390000000004
the old panels you've ever seen like the

3161.059 --> 3166.46
old Bugs Bunny Looney Tunes cartoons

3163.339 --> 3169.49
where like they were I distinctly

3166.46 --> 3171.619
remember one where like they were

3169.49 --> 3176.4199999999996
arguing about whether the earth was flat

3171.619 --> 3181.1800000000003
pourcel was a globe it was like really

3176.42 --> 3186.079
old life again maybe early seventies

3181.18 --> 3189.14
maybe even sixties I'm not sure wasn't

3186.079 --> 3191.509
that an educational cartoon cuz they did

3189.14 --> 3195.71
that no no no I'm talking about Looney

3191.509 --> 3197.96
Tunes like Bugs Bunny you know the dark

3195.71 --> 3201.23
pensive Looney Tunes Boyle oh you mean

3197.96 --> 3208.759
there are definitely arguing like one

3201.23 --> 3211.069
guy was like it's flat it's a flat yeah

3208.759 --> 3227.2400000000002
the guy who was always eating Bugs Bunny

3211.069 --> 3231.529
he was Columbus there and then no it's

3227.24 --> 3234.6189999999997
flat like that yeah a really good one

3231.529 --> 3243.91
yeah it was like a historical episode

3234.619 --> 3246.109
about Columbus it's awesome you know

3243.91 --> 3249.2
they'll make fun of it at the same time

3246.109 --> 3251.87
no no I thought it was excellent

3249.2 --> 3253.1499999999996
cuz they were making the globe guy look

3251.87 --> 3257.8399999999997
really stupid

3253.15 --> 3259.9100000000003
and like even as a globe or you would

3257.84 --> 3263.23
still think that's kind of funny in a

3259.91 --> 3266.69
way because you know how it wasn't real

3263.23 --> 3269.2400000000002
but to us it's like oh my god that's so

3266.69 --> 3271.28
freakin hilarious because he really is

3269.24 --> 3275.0
an idiot and the guy hitting him with a

3271.28 --> 3280.63
hammer really is right that double

3275.0 --> 3283.46

3392.96 --> 3402.85
spider-man venom and carnage that's a

3399.08 --> 3406.369
whole sleeve this is weird

3402.85 --> 3407.8689999999997
hold on yet people are somebody says

3406.369 --> 3409.31
that the debate isn't starting for

3407.869 --> 3412.73
another hour and I didn't see any

3409.31 --> 3415.58
announcement yet either so weird maybe

3412.73 --> 3431.9900000000002
he's done with Spanish class or

3415.58 --> 3434.119
something well look it's like it should

3431.99 --> 3436.8199999999997
start right now and he tends to put out

3434.119 --> 3439.88
hangout links like at least 15 minutes

3436.82 --> 3443.9900000000002
before and he hasn't so that is kind of

3439.88 --> 3444.83
a sign on the wall there but I guess

3443.99 --> 3446.66
okay

3444.83 --> 3449.66
well then I started an hour early for

3446.66 --> 3456.5899999999997
the first time and it's no longer

3449.66 --> 3458.42
required Scootie and I thinking like I

3456.59 --> 3460.79
could quit or I could just do another

3458.42 --> 3467.96
show to make up for not having a show

3460.79 --> 3471.35
yesterday like a two-hour show it is a

3467.96 --> 3474.16
bit long though especially if there's

3471.35 --> 3477.14
gonna be two more debates after that

3474.16 --> 3479.75
yeah but you know what I guarantee even

3477.14 --> 3482.6
if you go another hour people are gonna

3479.75 --> 3486.23
listen there's people with everything no

3482.6 --> 3488.45
that's true why not you know okay that's

3486.23 --> 3493.34
I mean it's up to you alright

3488.45 --> 3499.31
I don't really care if you say it's too

3493.34 --> 3502.07
boring for you no not now it's more no

3499.31 --> 3503.93
it's fun but the thing is when you have

3502.07 --> 3505.84
fun for a very long time you're going to

3503.93 --> 3509.96
be drained usually and

3505.84 --> 3516.039
that's it I am I put a lot of energy in

3509.96 --> 3520.069
it so that's energies your show

3516.039 --> 3524.779
but yeah let's go for you to have fun

3520.069 --> 3534.14
like a conversation tends to hype me up

3524.779 --> 3536.99
more than training I mean it's already

3534.14 --> 3540.52
rain and when I get into the

3536.99 --> 3543.89
conversation that's different you know I

3540.52 --> 3546.2599999999998
like I just like character exploration

3543.89 --> 3549.91
like we going out who somebody is that's

3546.26 --> 3556.4
actually intelligent and that's like

3549.91 --> 3557.93
serious kick to me it is it's like

3556.4 --> 3561.44
somebody opening up their mind and

3557.93 --> 3563.24
suddenly just like oh freak I'm figuring

3561.44 --> 3565.2200000000003
out who they are and it's like the

3563.24 --> 3570.0099999999998
crystal of their personality

3565.22 --> 3570.0099999999998
the fractal of it it's amazing

3571.02 --> 3574.119
[Music]

3575.71 --> 3589.25
indeed so okay yeah I don't know

3585.819 --> 3601.069
anything in specific you had in mind you

3589.25 --> 3609.589
wanted to talk about maybe well I think

3601.069 --> 3611.93
then I made yeah yeah if we don't yeah I

3609.589 --> 3613.91
don't I guess I don't want to like to

3611.93 --> 3616.22
spend an hour talking about Netflix or

3613.91 --> 3618.799
something you know like I don't mind

3616.22 --> 3622.64
talking about it for like five minutes

3618.799 --> 3626.72
but I test it it's not really a subject

3622.64 --> 3628.7889999999998
for the record though well if it becomes

3626.72 --> 3631.0099999999998
really Flat Earth related if we make a

3628.789 --> 3633.1090000000004
study object out of for example a

3631.01 --> 3636.71
science fiction serie we could do that

3633.109 --> 3639.41
sometime but I might actually do that

3636.71 --> 3642.079
sometime as long as I'm not gonna show

3639.41 --> 3644.0589999999997
footage that should be allowed so so

3642.079 --> 3647.28
what why don't you get like somebody

3644.059 --> 3654.8500000000004
like does it's on does it come on

3647.28 --> 3658.15
no we got like a warm-up debate debates

3654.85 --> 3661.66
really what what jazz akanda has to say

3658.15 --> 3664.9900000000002
about things apparently having Jess

3661.66 --> 3669.54
Akana is about effective as effective as

3664.99 --> 3669.54
having P Mars on when he has a famous

3670.74 --> 3680.4399999999996
just now that's true but he is a

3677.65 --> 3690.58
blithering in here he is more like the

3680.44 --> 3697.87
drunken morning breakfast show know

3690.58 --> 3700.5099999999998
drunken people like maybe he's like oh
