halfway May

165.53 --> 168.53
2020

174.37 --> 179.31900000000002
all right so yeah I went to bed really

176.44 --> 183.459
early again wait no not that early

179.319 --> 187.06
actually I don't know what it was but I

183.459 --> 189.06900000000002
did like finally get myself to make some

187.06 --> 192.459
proper dinner yesterday sort of an

189.069 --> 194.91
experimental thing and what yeah and I

192.459 --> 197.64000000000001
really needed that like they feel

194.91 --> 200.65
very renewed

197.64 --> 203.319
like I really should break this stupid

200.65 --> 206.25
habit of mine of just postponing bacon

203.319 --> 208.63
making big meals because it's more work

206.25 --> 210.549
there's so many of these types of weird

208.63 --> 213.25
little habits that I need to break in

210.549 --> 214.95000000000002
order to just fix the situation for

213.25 --> 219.04
myself and

214.95 --> 222.51899999999998
yeah I'm gonna do it more and more to

219.04 --> 224.879
basically just crack down on own on

222.519 --> 227.81900000000002
useless laziness

224.879 --> 230.79
like they don't want a feeling

227.819 --> 233.56
because I got some of that

230.79 --> 235.82899999999998
but yeah right now I'm feeling great

233.56 --> 235.829
actually

239.51 --> 245.64
[Music]

242.23 --> 248.91
I'm playing not own a plane

245.64 --> 248.91
right ah

249.9 --> 252.9
so

253.29 --> 258.78
what was going on yesterday flattered at

255.819 --> 258.78
the Bates again I

262.29 --> 268.3
think I missed most of on Benjamin's so

266.08 --> 270.09999999999997
I didn't really watch you lie I did go

268.3 --> 273.1
and watch you like a new series on

270.1 --> 275.61
Netflix because my Star Trek the

273.1 --> 277.99
original series ran out a few days ago

275.61 --> 280.90000000000003
probably also had something to do with

277.99 --> 284.34000000000003
me getting really annoyed because I got

280.9 --> 284.34
really used to watching it

284.97 --> 291.90000000000003
and did kind of like stop abruptly just

289.54 --> 291.90000000000003
like that

294.35 --> 299.46000000000004
[Music]

296.46 --> 299.46
but

301.11 --> 307.08000000000004
right yeah I started watching this new

303.82 --> 310.0
series it's not very

307.08 --> 311.25
intellectual though but I don't know it

310.0 --> 314.52
was like a

311.25 --> 317.44
thing Siri this going down for a while

314.52 --> 320.5
I'm just checking it out but it's like a

317.44 --> 322.169
lot of these series you know and just in

320.5 --> 324.55
general with Netflix

322.169 --> 326.07
it's like starting to become almost

324.55 --> 329.289
embarrassing

326.07 --> 333.18
yeah that sounds really bad it's like

329.289 --> 335.43
every type of serie you can just see

333.18 --> 338.919
how it was

335.43 --> 341.139
fabricated it's like very specific in

338.919 --> 343.79999999999995
line with certain principles but it's

341.139 --> 343.8
always

344.55 --> 350.289
or almost always so constructed in a way

348.07 --> 351.9
and this series definitely falls in that

350.289 --> 356.62
category

351.9 --> 358.81
but yeah style wise and all that it

356.62 --> 361.3
reminds me of a couple of people that I

358.81 --> 362.889
know and I do kind of find pleasant to

361.3 --> 366.69
watch but it does make me feel like I'm

362.889 --> 370.18
watching this almost like

366.69 --> 373.63
non-sexual romance novel type thing it

370.18 --> 376.43
does make me feel like wow this is

373.63 --> 379.88
really dumb and it can really see why at

376.43 --> 382.52
points but I'm still like I don't know

379.88 --> 384.34
interested in the setup and what they're

382.52 --> 387.38
gonna do with it

384.34 --> 389.89
but yeah I'm like 'event you can see it

387.38 --> 392.96
by my sweat it's like

389.89 --> 395.16999999999996
but I still kind of want to follow it so

392.96 --> 398.59
I'm up to it for like the fifth episode

395.17 --> 403.21000000000004
it's called Good Witch and

398.59 --> 406.45
like that lady in many ways reminds me

403.21 --> 410.39
thanks autoplay

406.45 --> 413.27
reminds me a lot about my stepmom a lot

410.39 --> 417.66999999999996
because she's very much like that very

413.27 --> 420.90999999999997
like you can't touch her

417.67 --> 425.27000000000004
like untouchable nice

420.91 --> 428.48
but wise and yeah I appreciate that type

425.27 --> 431.10999999999996
of character those type of people a lot

428.48 --> 435.02000000000004
the very rare

431.11 --> 438.74
or like they're very rare that you can

435.02 --> 440.87
for me that I can find some kind of

438.74 --> 443.29
entrance or purpose to it you know those

440.87 --> 445.96
people will have to

443.29 --> 449.35
be able to

445.96 --> 449.34999999999997
grasp you at

449.86 --> 457.88
my stepmom I guess the and she does she

454.55 --> 460.97
does get me very thankful for that like

457.88 --> 464.62
she didn't get me then I'd have a

460.97 --> 468.16
problem with my dad probably

464.62 --> 471.77
but she does and I don't know the series

468.16 --> 474.52000000000004
it's like trying to look it for me it's

471.77 --> 474.52
almost like

476.35 --> 484.13
start to see what statistically has been

481.34 --> 487.82
thought out to be on that level and

484.13 --> 490.94
normal for me because yeah I am kind of

487.82 --> 494.98
isolated and that's not dirty crude it's

490.94 --> 494.98
just because I'm kind of a hermit for

495.91 --> 501.22900000000004
me I

497.95 --> 504.08
often have like trouble even figuring

501.229 --> 506.4
out what normal standard social behavior

504.08 --> 507.5
is like what that's a to be and how that

506.4 --> 511.40999999999997
works

507.5 --> 513.14
always been kind of a mystery to me so I

511.41 --> 515.27
like to study these things

513.14 --> 518.309
for that reason

515.27 --> 518.309
[Music]

518.84 --> 526.039
anyway it's a series I'm watching I

521.7 --> 526.0390000000001
guess nobody's really gonna care

526.19 --> 531.9300000000001
yeah uncertain for those that will about

529.47 --> 534.99
this series I think that's probably more

531.93 --> 537.2399999999999
women that'll appreciate it I think

534.99 --> 539.76
that's what it's aimed for mostly but

537.24 --> 541.83
once the two things that really caught

539.76 --> 544.71
my attention so far like I started

541.83 --> 546.6800000000001
noticing a pattern like whoa there's

544.71 --> 549.98
been certain elements

546.68 --> 553.38
completely excluded from

549.98 --> 555.48
the series for like from that reality

553.38 --> 557.16
it's kind of fascinating and creepy at

555.48 --> 559.94
the same time it's like they've created

557.16 --> 563.76
it's very specific safe spaces

559.94 --> 567.0600000000001
so weird right so things that are yeah

563.76 --> 569.72
you could probably already guess there

567.06 --> 572.75
is there doesn't seem to be any kind of

569.72 --> 575.3100000000001
mentioning so far at least of

572.75 --> 578.49
Christianity it's like it doesn't exist

575.31 --> 580.2199999999999
there's like these types that have that

578.49 --> 583.92
but it's

580.22 --> 586.7900000000001
it seems to be a dichotomy it really

583.92 --> 589.28
it's about that between the medical

586.79 --> 594.3
modern world and

589.28 --> 597.05
like the alt witches kind of remedy type

594.3 --> 600.63
shamanism type thinking

597.05 --> 603.0899999999999
that's the paradigm and it like there's

600.63 --> 605.16
just no mention so far at all of any

603.09 --> 608.37
type of religion or Christianity of

605.16 --> 610.68
people talking about that so that's like

608.37 --> 612.9
already a bit of a warning sign to me

610.68 --> 616.14
although they really do try to be good

612.9 --> 618.54
you know they really try to be very very

616.14 --> 621.87
Christian in a way the old-fashioned

618.54 --> 624.9
type of super forgive for but in also

621.87 --> 627.03
with a with a sensible perspective up to

624.9 --> 629.67
a certain point like it that does work

627.03 --> 631.68
it so yeah I found things in this theory

629.67 --> 635.37
that is kind of fascinating even though

631.68 --> 637.38
there's a lot of dumb things about it

635.37 --> 639.89
but maybe that's just me being very

637.38 --> 644.49
judgmental

639.89 --> 647.8199999999999
and another thing that I noticed this is

644.49 --> 652.11
that there is no mention of the

647.82 --> 655.0200000000001
existence of money and like the one time

652.11 --> 659.36
money is kind of brought out is in like

655.02 --> 662.88
a laundry criminal scandal so it's like

659.36 --> 664.86
that was weird because there's like this

662.88 --> 667.35
woman whose main character she has like

664.86 --> 669.6800000000001
a store with potions and stuff but it's

667.35 --> 671.82
all just her herbal remedies pretty

669.68 --> 673.77
interesting stuff I'm kind of curious to

671.82 --> 676.8900000000001
listen in like what is mentioned like is

673.77 --> 677.72
that taken from actual knowledge or did

676.89 --> 681.36
they just

677.72 --> 683.13
random up [ __ ] you know I'm trying

681.36 --> 685.53
to figure out if there's a consistency

683.13 --> 688.17
to the lore that is being applied as

685.53 --> 689.88
part of the act of the character because

688.17 --> 691.92
I'm interested in that kind of thing

689.88 --> 694.05
also to the nature is what they're

691.92 --> 696.0899999999999
trying to accomplish are they trying to

694.05 --> 697.8
make it look bad really and covertly

696.09 --> 701.6700000000001
look there's all these kinds of possible

697.8 --> 703.9799999999999
Grabow agendas there are no doubt it's

701.67 --> 706.26
involved in almost every freaking series

703.98 --> 709.6700000000001
on Netflix these days and I'm just

706.26 --> 713.55
curious I'm curious to figure it out

709.67 --> 717.0899999999999
but there is no mention of money at all

713.55 --> 718.9799999999999
like people come to her and like oh yeah

717.09 --> 722.34
I have some issue did this and that and

718.98 --> 726.33
then she's like oh yeah I use this but

722.34 --> 727.95
she just gives it to everyone so that

726.33 --> 730.6500000000001
gives like the impression like she's

727.95 --> 733.1700000000001
this ultra generous person that just

730.65 --> 736.0799999999999
constantly gifts stuff away never talks

733.17 --> 738.12
about there's no talk of money ever yet

736.08 --> 741.21
she lives in this vote almost like a

738.12 --> 743.75
freaking palace and her husband died

741.21 --> 746.76
it's part of the rule and

743.75 --> 749.03
that's like already since the series

746.76 --> 753.36
started and

749.03 --> 754.92
it's just like if you want to be so

753.36 --> 758.78
funny about you can look at it it's like

754.92 --> 760.31
oh holy [ __ ] that is suspicious

758.78 --> 763.74
yeah

760.31 --> 766.8599999999999
so I don't know I guess there's much

763.74 --> 769.42
more to the series than then you think I

766.86 --> 770.85
guess or maybe I'm just looking too much

769.42 --> 774.43
into it

770.85 --> 777.6
but there's a lot of like harp music and

774.43 --> 780.8199999999999
bells and things and

777.6 --> 783.58
it reminds me of certain type of music

780.82 --> 788.11
also that I've heard in video games that

783.58 --> 790.21
I find very pleasant and dream so the

788.11 --> 793.24
creepy thing though is that when you

790.21 --> 796.36
combine that that sense said yeah that

793.24 --> 799.0
sense that music really brings you it's

796.36 --> 801.36
like almost like the Christmas feel but

799.0 --> 804.57
not like Christmas but in that direction

801.36 --> 807.28
you know and

804.57 --> 811.57
when you combine that with things that

807.28 --> 813.49
are actually kind of feel off all wrong

811.57 --> 815.2
then it becomes really creepy that's

813.49 --> 819.51
also happens by the way with Christmas

815.2 --> 823.24
movies when that that's generally known

819.51 --> 825.64
like the effect of the music combined

823.24 --> 827.86
with what is presented matters a lot the

825.64 --> 830.98
context matters so much for what we'll

827.86 --> 834.36
do with you it's like really sound then

830.98 --> 837.49
such music is just a pure delight

834.36 --> 839.17
but if things are kind of off in what

837.49 --> 843.13
you're seeing during the music then it

839.17 --> 847.8299999999999
then can get then can start to dislocate

843.13 --> 847.83
your spirit almost it's hard to describe

850.17 --> 856.11
no games no TV no Netflix for this guy

853.39 --> 860.26
okay for in each good for you I

856.11 --> 863.8000000000001
am NOT very eager in delving into new

860.26 --> 865.17
games and new series I just saw this and

863.8 --> 868.3
I was like

865.17 --> 869.43
let's see this is how it works it's

868.3 --> 872.89
almost like

869.43 --> 876.0899999999999
how it looks in the icon on the sit and

872.89 --> 879.63
the thing it's so deceiving you know

876.09 --> 882.09
unless it like it has a play out

879.63 --> 884.53
but

882.09 --> 887.44
sometimes I just have to click on it to

884.53 --> 889.99
see if it is as bad as I suspect it to

887.44 --> 892.6800000000001
be and then yeah sometimes it turns out

889.99 --> 898.41
it's actually halfway decent

892.68 --> 898.41
so but I don't try out a lot of things

901.01 --> 904.01
what

912.4 --> 918.72
okay Missouri I have no idea what you're

914.589 --> 918.72
talking about whoa what are you

920.13 --> 923.97
Jay Dyer what

931.589 --> 935.0100000000001
never heard of them

942.46 --> 946.95
that sounds really creepy Missouri bear

951.82 --> 954.9090000000001
[Music]

960.7 --> 965.08
yeah there's a lot of creepy series in

963.22 --> 967.57
between there on Netflix as well like

965.08 --> 970.71
they get really [ __ ] up sometimes and

967.57 --> 974.7
I don't even try it out absolutely not I

970.71 --> 976.62
might have done that like ten years ago

974.7 --> 978.48
but

976.62 --> 982.33
no

978.48 --> 985.6
like because it repulses me I don't like

982.33 --> 987.46
darkness and I don't like arrogance in

985.6 --> 989.94
the face of dark just like high that I

987.46 --> 994.0
did like we can get away with it just

989.94 --> 996.72
because no yeah no living person or

994.0 --> 1000.32
whatever knows it's

996.72 --> 1005.0
can't stand that [ __ ] anymore oh

1000.32 --> 1005.0
hey sorry that Cosentino hello new

1012.38 --> 1016.429
[Music]

1022.68 --> 1027.1789999999999
[Music]

1027.84 --> 1036.3
well the Magpies just keep on chattering

1032.85 --> 1036.3
doing it a lot

1038.39 --> 1041.509
[Music]

1051.77 --> 1056.809
misery why is that an interesting that

1054.299 --> 1056.809
cost me

1057.23 --> 1063.799
it's just disgusting darks packed that's

1061.29 --> 1067.1399999999999
what that is I

1063.799 --> 1070.259
don't find that interesting

1067.14 --> 1070.259
[Music]

1075.07 --> 1080.559
[Music]

1088.78 --> 1095.1
all right yeah yeah no yeah battle

1092.62 --> 1097.54
Martin was talking a lot about the

1095.1 --> 1098.4599999999998
pepper yeah apparently I didn't know

1097.54 --> 1103.09
this

1098.46 --> 1106.78
he is literally a theologist he studied

1103.09 --> 1107.76
that stuff to be detail had no idea

1106.78 --> 1113.519
about that

1107.76 --> 1113.519
[Music]

1114.09 --> 1121.48
but yeah I definitely stand by what I've

1117.22 --> 1124.8
said and yeah at it I've always

1121.48 --> 1128.77
emphasized this it's the story it is

1124.8 --> 1131.02
what is in there and I've never been too

1128.77 --> 1133.15
concerned with the details only with the

1131.02 --> 1135.69
meaning because the meaning is what

1133.15 --> 1138.7
you're gonna tune with the frequency and

1135.69 --> 1139.95
then the details you know and where does

1138.7 --> 1143.68
it come from

1139.95 --> 1146.31
it yeah because it's always gonna be

1143.68 --> 1149.05
chaos in some way

1146.31 --> 1152.3799999999999
on the exoteric side and even on the

1149.05 --> 1154.54
historical side you know what what if

1152.38 --> 1156.46
sometimes yeah somewhere in the future

1154.54 --> 1159.51
they'll just tell us like yeah no no no

1156.46 --> 1161.92
this is now all provably falsified

1159.51 --> 1164.44
all that [ __ ] and you're like Jesus

1161.92 --> 1168.67
really never existed none of it like

1164.44 --> 1170.97
what if they did that and what if they

1168.67 --> 1175.21
like kind of

1170.97 --> 1177.91
really did have or at least seeming to

1175.21 --> 1183.1000000000001
have really solid proof for that and

1177.91 --> 1186.22
just like what then you know is that

1183.1 --> 1188.56
like oh then it's all broken if they

1186.22 --> 1191.05
really had that pretty not saying that

1188.56 --> 1194.53
that's gonna happen but just a

1191.05 --> 1195.6299999999999
hypothetical so I'm like no no no that

1194.53 --> 1197.91
it's all

1195.63 --> 1202.6000000000001
[Music]

1197.91 --> 1207.27
man-made related things know what gives

1202.6 --> 1214.08
me recognition with Jesus Christ is

1207.27 --> 1217.08
what what that is what he did and just

1214.08 --> 1217.08
like

1218.08 --> 1222.9499999999998
at this point it doesn't even matter to

1220.7 --> 1225.4
me anymore like if there really was

1222.95 --> 1227.44
anyone like that ever

1225.4 --> 1229.8090000000002
because

1227.44 --> 1233.51
that's

1229.809 --> 1235.8999999999999
it works that it's kind of as simple as

1233.51 --> 1239.179
that it just it works

1235.9 --> 1243.76
it has it gives a very good purpose it

1239.179 --> 1247.76
it gives all the essence of logos

1243.76 --> 1249.17
in a very deep detail and that is really

1247.76 --> 1252.64
all that matters so you could even

1249.17 --> 1256.22
almost please don't take it as blasphemy

1252.64 --> 1258.0200000000002
this is just conceptual hypothetical but

1256.22 --> 1260.679
you could even just say in a way that

1258.02 --> 1264.05
the Bible is its own

1260.679 --> 1267.3500000000001
paganism because could be considered

1264.05 --> 1268.9289999999999
that paganism was like neo-paganism

1267.35 --> 1271.3999999999999
weird kind of

1268.929 --> 1273.8600000000001
yeah this is gonna rub along people

1271.4 --> 1278.38
people the wrong way but paganism was

1273.86 --> 1280.76
very much in a way just wise lessons and

1278.38 --> 1284.2700000000002
sometimes some gravelled stuff as well

1280.76 --> 1285.37
but mostly just wise lessons and put in

1284.27 --> 1288.65
a

1285.37 --> 1290.51
in a memorable way like either in a

1288.65 --> 1294.8500000000001
story or you know all kinds but it's

1290.51 --> 1298.69
about the information that helps and

1294.85 --> 1303.309
yeah I see Jesus Christ as

1298.69 --> 1307.429
as just something like it's like a

1303.309 --> 1312.1
psychology paganism like err this is

1307.429 --> 1312.1000000000001
what we figured out is the best

1312.85 --> 1317.8899999999999
so if you see it like that then if

1316.91 --> 1320.3500000000001
somebody

1317.89 --> 1323.72
would bring up

1320.35 --> 1326.6899999999998
like oh yeah we had this Torico evidence

1323.72 --> 1328.94
that this was falsified in every detail

1326.69 --> 1330.8
and it's like wooly [ __ ] they're

1328.94 --> 1333.559
checking the carbon dating on the paper

1330.8 --> 1335.6
it's all real and and the writing is

1333.559 --> 1337.49
correct and like all the study all the

1335.6 --> 1338.74
theologists come together us like holy

1337.49 --> 1342.64
[ __ ]

1338.74 --> 1344.8
this is absolutely legitimate then

1342.64 --> 1350.65
the icon

1344.8 --> 1355.059
the the mighty teaching of of yeah the

1350.65 --> 1356.91
best a man can be Jesus Christ is still

1355.059 --> 1360.3899999999999
there

1356.91 --> 1365.0500000000002
with all the teachings within it

1360.39 --> 1368.14
then see did this I don't know maybe

1365.05 --> 1370.0
just stepping way outside of the comfort

1368.14 --> 1371.71
zone of many religious people right now

1370.0 --> 1374.46
it's just I don't want to do that but

1371.71 --> 1374.46
this is I

1377.64 --> 1382.48
don't know does this make any sense to

1379.96 --> 1385.5900000000001
you guys what I'm doing what I think

1382.48 --> 1387.94
feel about this

1385.59 --> 1390.8799999999999
anyway oh by the way thank you Amanda

1387.94 --> 1393.42
you know I see big capital letters

1390.88 --> 1393.42
PayPal

1394.679 --> 1398.13
certainly use them

1403.55 --> 1408.79
ah wow thank you Thank You Amanda young

1406.58 --> 1412.87
20 euros

1408.79 --> 1412.87
they'll be great

1415.9 --> 1422.21
yeah the mid mid middle of the month is

1419.12 --> 1424.6699999999998
always a tough time doesn't really seem

1422.21 --> 1427.31
to matter like even what incomes have

1424.67 --> 1430.46
been it always managed to get tight

1427.31 --> 1432.56
somehow they'll definitely help thank

1430.46 --> 1435.01
you so much is a great relief thank you

1432.56 --> 1435.01
money you

1441.22 --> 1447.29
what is that Missouri Bear Elliott and

1444.8 --> 1448.8999999999999
the vibe and Bible can be this and what

1447.29 --> 1452.4099999999999
is that

1448.9 --> 1457.24
I'm and I'm just

1452.41 --> 1457.24
talking purely from energy here

1458.77 --> 1466.69
it's the witness that makes the Bible

1461.93 --> 1466.69
the book it is today what

1489.24 --> 1496.07
I'm sorry the name myth collection what

1493.11 --> 1496.07
is such

1496.46 --> 1503.63
BS is it's like the preponderance of

1499.32 --> 1503.6299999999999
books is that what that stands for

1511.64 --> 1517.69
or is that like the Greek mythology's

1514.79 --> 1517.69
something

1520.12 --> 1525.07
yes the name sounds really familiar

1529.55 --> 1533.98
[Music]

1530.83 --> 1536.84
all right yeah it is

1533.98 --> 1540.1
from the Greek mythology's the Greek a

1536.84 --> 1540.1
vas right

1540.8 --> 1543.97
[Music]

1547.85 --> 1554.78
oh hi al Hume cthe thanks for the to

1550.73 --> 1557.3
Euro 29 superjet the nation I want to

1554.78 --> 1561.25
talk more about flat globe earth last 25

1557.3 --> 1561.25
minutes sure why not

1562.93 --> 1570.5
well yeah I do suffer slightly from like

1567.56 --> 1572.81
flat earth globe fatigue a little I

1570.5 --> 1574.43
guess that like the Coriolis storms were

1572.81 --> 1576.79
a little bit much for my branches to

1574.43 --> 1576.79
handle

1578.8 --> 1582.76
they're tough on my leaves

1592.57 --> 1596.55
but sure yeah yeah what is it you want

1595.06 --> 1599.62
to talk about

1596.55 --> 1601.87
it for me it's really tough to talk

1599.62 --> 1605.4299999999998
about it just by myself because at the

1601.87 --> 1608.02
moment I'm not super inspired you know I

1605.43 --> 1610.69
keep on saying there's just these things

1608.02 --> 1611.8899999999999
these concepts that are like yeah we

1610.69 --> 1613.81
need to know this we need to know that

1611.89 --> 1617.38
and I can talk about if somebody asks

1613.81 --> 1620.79
like like okay how would we measure the

1617.38 --> 1624.63
equator line how could you do that I

1620.79 --> 1627.03
guess I talked about this with the

1624.63 --> 1631.0
good servant

1627.03 --> 1632.2
the other day as well I almost wish we

1631.0 --> 1633.94
could have recorded that was a really

1632.2 --> 1636.24
good conversation bringing all that up

1633.94 --> 1636.24
again

1644.07 --> 1648.5
I could bring up some old drawings you

1646.26 --> 1652.22
know I I

1648.5 --> 1655.07
still have like a a

1652.22 --> 1659.19
cache for a

1655.07 --> 1660.9199999999998
what is it a slideshow with like several

1659.19 --> 1663.39
pictures and all that

1660.92 --> 1666.3000000000002
but yeah I've never really come to

1663.39 --> 1667.76
utilizing it because then kind of Adam

1666.3 --> 1670.86
came forth with

1667.76 --> 1673.61
with this animated background doesn't

1670.86 --> 1676.4099999999999
really work with that I

1673.61 --> 1679.26
haven't really figured out in how to do

1676.41 --> 1682.3100000000002
something like that yet but it have like

1679.26 --> 1682.31
slideshow material

1690.48 --> 1694.43
yes are you okay that's right

1698.22 --> 1702.049
or about Effie proofs

1703.1 --> 1709.59
well rather like proofs against the

1706.379 --> 1712.6999999999998
globe because yeah most of the arc yeah

1709.59 --> 1714.259
you know that it is basically just

1712.7 --> 1716.49
accepted

1714.259 --> 1718.789
that there's not going to be any

1716.49 --> 1720.32
scientific evidence of

1718.789 --> 1724.129
a

1720.32 --> 1727.35
geometrical aspect of the realm

1724.129 --> 1729.86
that's not under the that doesn't that

1727.35 --> 1732.33
won't fall on the science so

1729.86 --> 1734.9699999999998
that's it's like the first realization

1732.33 --> 1736.83
like yeah all of this has nothing to do

1734.97 --> 1739.25
or almost nothing to do with science

1736.83 --> 1742.139
there

1739.25 --> 1744.96
are aspects within the realm that have

1742.139 --> 1749.1
to do with science of course but most of

1744.96 --> 1752.97
it especially the the earth the

1749.1 --> 1756.9499999999998
cosmogony that aspect has very little to

1752.97 --> 1756.95
do with science in many ways

1757.22 --> 1764.1490000000001
proofs are not scientific oh

1761.75 --> 1767.009
right oh

1764.149 --> 1769.1689999999999
that's a tough one though you know

1767.009 --> 1773.659
there's all these issues now with words

1769.169 --> 1778.3200000000002
and well if you'd say proof

1773.659 --> 1780.24
like where Nathan or especially QE would

1778.32 --> 1782.629
be present he would still take that as

1780.24 --> 1786.09
scientific proof

1782.629 --> 1788.309
it's just like when you say theory for

1786.09 --> 1790.379
me the word theory is a big problem

1788.309 --> 1792.899
because theory is really I've tried to

1790.379 --> 1795.6899999999998
reroute it into concept only the problem

1792.899 --> 1798.799
is is that a concept by the nature of

1795.69 --> 1803.3600000000001
the word is like a singular thing a

1798.799 --> 1808.139
theory is more like a a tree structure

1803.36 --> 1808.9399999999998
it could be more it's a wider concept

1808.139 --> 1814.519
basically

1808.94 --> 1814.519
so it's very tough for me to yeah

1814.61 --> 1820.5
to bypass the issue of my utilization of

1818.639 --> 1822.629
the word theory which is very rather

1820.5 --> 1823.879
than how a lot of people use it

1822.629 --> 1826.83
colloquially

1823.879 --> 1829.6999999999998
just that's been ingrained in me a lot

1826.83 --> 1833.6
it's very tough to deal with

1829.7 --> 1833.6000000000001
evidence is not proof

1836.63 --> 1841.3700000000001
evidence Oh God we're gonna go there

1839.31 --> 1841.37
again

1842.06 --> 1847.37
evidence for and proof is like

1844.83 --> 1851.3
definitive is that it

1847.37 --> 1853.4899999999998
evidence is like a potential

1851.3 --> 1857.25
clue and

1853.49 --> 1859.46
we're proof is definitive that's it

1857.25 --> 1859.46
right

1866.66 --> 1872.24
evidence is an exhibit in court huh oh

1873.26 --> 1881.06
that's from another perspective that's

1876.71 --> 1885.38
judicial that's like legal evidence

1881.06 --> 1888.9199999999998
isn't it that doesn't fall under

1885.38 --> 1888.92
the physics department

1891.08 --> 1896.0
you also got to keep that apart so you

1894.75 --> 1898.68
got

1896.0 --> 1905.48
basically the physics department

1898.68 --> 1905.48
you got the cultural Department and

1906.11 --> 1911.9299999999998
what is it again

1908.28 --> 1911.93
physics cultural

1916.1 --> 1922.1499999999999
oh yeah and judicial so these are three

1920.45 --> 1925.63
different

1922.15 --> 1928.25
wider utilizations ground up off

1925.63 --> 1930.8300000000002
language it's like different usage of

1928.25 --> 1933.8
language and there's like parallels with

1930.83 --> 1935.98
words and ballers even to this day

1933.8 --> 1941.33
all-purpose

1935.98 --> 1944.6
misuse the overlay of certain words to

1941.33 --> 1947.87
misinterpret them and then graph the

1944.6 --> 1949.76
meaning of the word from another context

1947.87 --> 1953.3899999999999
from another I like a judicial or

1949.76 --> 1956.9
cultural angle and graph that falsely

1953.39 --> 1960.95
basically implanting that into the wrong

1956.9 --> 1963.7900000000002
setting on purpose to confuse [ __ ] so

1960.95 --> 1963.79
they've even done that

1965.89 --> 1970.93
they even done it with the word science

1968.87 --> 1974.26
itself

1970.93 --> 1974.26
bizarre that

1974.41 --> 1979.66
science was originally words that were

1978.41 --> 1982.1000000000001
specifically

1979.66 --> 1985.13
originating from physics the physics

1982.1 --> 1988.76
type of thinking and uses the

1985.13 --> 1992.2
utilization of words and then it became

1988.76 --> 1996.05
culture alized and now they are just

1992.2 --> 1998.9
constantly missed there me trying to mix

1996.05 --> 2000.93
culture in with the very different

1998.9 --> 2004.92
approach of

2000.93 --> 2004.92
original science and physics

2023.74 --> 2030.61
isn't a validated cause-and-effect

2026.35 --> 2030.61
relationship with scientific theory

2030.64 --> 2036.5800000000002
yes yeah that think so

2036.85 --> 2044.53
if I if it is indeed that but yeah that

2040.66 --> 2044.53
requires a lot so

2068.089 --> 2073.52
that's fascinating thing to say Missouri

2070.98 --> 2073.52
bear eye

2075.379 --> 2079.069
I would tend to agree

2100.14 --> 2102.65
yeah

2102.89 --> 2109.589
well good servant that's that all

2105.66 --> 2112.14
depends on what in what context you're

2109.589 --> 2115.099
using God as a variable if you're using

2112.14 --> 2117.0589999999997
it as the

2115.099 --> 2119.88
frequency that should be attuned to that

2117.059 --> 2122.4500000000003
mainly truth then you're absolutely

2119.88 --> 2125.6400000000003
correct because

2122.45 --> 2128.009
science caused an effect relationship

2125.64 --> 2130.489
establishment if you remove the truth

2128.009 --> 2133.98
from that yeah then it's completely

2130.489 --> 2138.119
it becomes completely nonsensical now if

2133.98 --> 2141.539
you're gonna refer to the implication of

2138.119 --> 2144.319
God yeah by the realization that our

2141.539 --> 2148.529
information basically comes from God

2144.319 --> 2151.859
technically that's bizarre thing then

2148.529 --> 2154.14
you're also correct so I guess that

2151.859 --> 2155.5389999999998
you're completely correct I just wanted

2154.14 --> 2159.68
to highlight

2155.539 --> 2159.6800000000003
yeah how much

2160.4 --> 2165.259
yeah I'm doing great good serve and I'm

2163.019 --> 2165.2589999999996
fine

2182.34 --> 2186.079
[Music]

2195.19 --> 2200.89
no Aries 106 that's sorry that's

2198.68 --> 2200.89
incorrect

2202.24 --> 2205.24
No

2209.36 --> 2215.3900000000003
that's what you're mentioning is the

2212.19 --> 2215.39
philosophy behind

2215.51 --> 2222.0600000000004
science

2217.61 --> 2223.65
the intention the spirit of science

2222.06 --> 2226.1
that's what you're talking about it's

2223.65 --> 2229.56
not science what you're talking about

2226.1 --> 2233.58
science is not concerned with such

2229.56 --> 2237.69
things it's a rigid mechanism it's like

2233.58 --> 2240.75
a very rigid puzzle and it's just only

2237.69 --> 2243.23
one way to do it that's what science is

2240.75 --> 2244.88
that's another

2243.23 --> 2247.83
metaphorical

2244.88 --> 2249.75
philosophical analysis of the scientific

2247.83 --> 2252.0
method that I just did because the

2249.75 --> 2254.73
scientific method is just a scientific

2252.0 --> 2258.54
method and it aims to establish the

2254.73 --> 2260.36
cause of an effect by varying

2258.54 --> 2265.7
manipulating

2260.36 --> 2268.71
yeah the effect the the phenomenon

2265.7 --> 2272.1299999999997
that's it that's really the only way you

2268.71 --> 2274.92
can explain it like I did there's better

2272.13 --> 2278.1
people to explain it to me I I usually

2274.92 --> 2280.35
mix up the things and [ __ ] if I have to

2278.1 --> 2282.8399999999997
do it like on the Spock just like that

2280.35 --> 2286.16
without first focusing a while that I

2282.84 --> 2286.1600000000003
have to really get me right

2286.94 --> 2294.48
because I'm not really a scientist like

2290.52 --> 2296.55
I could do it if I thought it was yea

2294.48 --> 2298.83
viable course of action that it would

2296.55 --> 2301.02
give some extra weight to something or

2298.83 --> 2303.21
that I really could figure out something

2301.02 --> 2305.06
interesting and then prove something

2303.21 --> 2308.46
scientifically about it

2305.06 --> 2311.57
but it's not like I am oh I am all about

2308.46 --> 2314.45
the scientific method no not enough

2311.57 --> 2317.4500000000003
it's not my main focus

2314.45 --> 2317.45
intellectually

2317.86 --> 2323.42
[Music]

2320.5 --> 2326.74
I'm actually much more about conceptual

2323.42 --> 2329.539
mechanics and especially the the

2326.74 --> 2334.0389999999998
ethereal side and the feelings and like

2329.539 --> 2336.6090000000004
purpose and how entire thinks settings

2334.039 --> 2340.15
can change how how

2336.609 --> 2343.0989999999997
seeming logic can just switch around

2340.15 --> 2344.75
like how information can be seen from

2343.099 --> 2347.089
one direction and then certainly in

2344.75 --> 2349.01
another context then we can be regarded

2347.089 --> 2351.77
completely different and how that works

2349.01 --> 2354.6400000000003
and none of that can be explained by

2351.77 --> 2358.63
science and none of it

2354.64 --> 2363.25
but all those things do matter a

2358.63 --> 2363.25
lot throughout time

2366.16 --> 2371.89
yeah the independent variable but isn't

2369.2 --> 2371.89
it the effect

2373.03 --> 2379.27
the phenomena you've yeah you vary it

2376.97 --> 2382.24
and then the effect

2379.27 --> 2385.089
changes accordingly right

2382.24 --> 2388.089
anyway

2385.089 --> 2388.089
right

2391.09 --> 2395.79
I knew I'd get into trouble if I try to

2393.4 --> 2398.58
sum it up

2395.79 --> 2401.02
phenomenon is the effect all right

2398.58 --> 2402.94
right well in that case yeah I was

2401.02 --> 2405.64
technically or wealth

2402.94 --> 2407.83
I was almost technically correct by

2405.64 --> 2409.7799999999997
saying yeah manipulate the effect

2407.83 --> 2411.37
because as you just said the phenomenon

2409.78 --> 2414.15
is the effect and that is what you're

2411.37 --> 2414.15
varying right

2417.84 --> 2423.57
yeah you're if you're trying to vary the

2420.49 --> 2423.5699999999997
cause of the effect

2423.96 --> 2426.96
there

2434.07 --> 2438.42
yeah the proposed cost but yeah

2439.83 --> 2443.96
dude okay I get it already

2456.98 --> 2461.2
yeah thanks for elaborating that again

2461.41 --> 2464.41
yeah

2474.299 --> 2479.09
hmm

2476.15 --> 2482.09
ah Thank You Amanda young for the $5

2479.09 --> 2485.59
superjet donation finally I get to watch

2482.09 --> 2487.9300000000003
your whole show at our win I'm blessed

2485.59 --> 2491.09
well thank you

2487.93 --> 2492.83
thank you for watching and supporting me

2491.09 --> 2495.07
always Amanda young it's great to have

2492.83 --> 2495.0699999999997
you

2505.09 --> 2513.6000000000004
now I think you gotta dry tell younger

2509.37 --> 2513.6
scientists either yep

2517.619 --> 2523.4700000000003
like at this point you know what is even

2520.99 --> 2528.089
a freaking scientist

2523.47 --> 2532.29
like is scientist even a profession

2528.089 --> 2537.369
I'm serious like is scientist a

2532.29 --> 2541.18
profession or is it just a skill that

2537.369 --> 2544.42
someone can use if they're very good at

2541.18 --> 2548.46
it in keeping it clear but is that a

2544.42 --> 2551.77
profession it's like oh I'm a scientist

2548.46 --> 2553.48
so oh wow so you actually understand the

2551.77 --> 2556.869
scientific method do you and you can

2553.48 --> 2558.78
utilize it that's great so what do you

2556.869 --> 2560.4900000000002
do for a living

2558.78 --> 2563.4900000000002
right

2560.49 --> 2563.49
right

2565.109 --> 2569.47
anyway Thank You Alan Byrne for the

2567.64 --> 2572.73
three-pound super chat donation have a

2569.47 --> 2577.3489999999997
good day from sunny Scotland

2572.73 --> 2577.349
thank you thank you very much

2595.7 --> 2601.4199999999996
right

2597.64 --> 2604.22
well you know what I

2601.42 --> 2606.02
always wanted to say I'm a scientist

2604.22 --> 2608.6299999999997
it's just that the word didn't turn out

2606.02 --> 2611.809
to mean what I thought it did so instead

2608.63 --> 2614.559
I just called myself a theorist I say

2611.809 --> 2618.4700000000003
hey I'm a cosmogonic Oh theorist I

2614.559 --> 2620.3190000000004
deal in realm conceptions and I'm also a

2618.47 --> 2622.93
societal studier

2620.319 --> 2628.42
and I

2622.93 --> 2631.609
play with it also in my game mastering

2628.42 --> 2633.16
I'm a lot yeah I'm very interested in

2631.609 --> 2637.119
all forms of

2633.16 --> 2641.1189999999997
so yeah social engineering and

2637.119 --> 2643.03
just historical and otherwise what's

2641.119 --> 2644.559
happening right now I

2643.03 --> 2647.71
like

2644.559 --> 2651.559
watching how that happens

2647.71 --> 2653.869
well not that I totally and it's just I

2651.559 --> 2656.6600000000003
like figuring it out and it's an

2653.869 --> 2658.9100000000003
approach of people in another way that

2656.66 --> 2662.1499999999996
actually gives me some kind of grip on

2658.91 --> 2664.609
the whole group idea because a group

2662.15 --> 2666.67
spirit socially has always been not very

2664.609 --> 2669.0789999999997
nice for me

2666.67 --> 2671.23
but through social engineering I've

2669.079 --> 2675.549
always like gotten a better

2671.23 --> 2677.809
understanding of how people function

2675.549 --> 2680.559
even though they don't understand it

2677.809 --> 2681.71
themselves see

2680.559 --> 2683.9900000000002
ya

2681.71 --> 2686.98
[Music]

2683.99 --> 2686.9799999999996
anyway

2687.5 --> 2690.71
[Music]

2692.71 --> 2699.2
so I'm all kinds of things by the

2694.97 --> 2700.79
scientist I guess I could I could be but

2699.2 --> 2702.9199999999996
yeah what's that even worth now yeah I

2700.79 --> 2705.59
could potentially apply the scientific

2702.92 --> 2709.1
method oh I said by the way I shouldn't

2705.59 --> 2711.38
forget I even had an idea for it with

2709.1 --> 2715.04
the moonlight to establish whether the

2711.38 --> 2718.84
moonlight is introducing cold energy or

2715.04 --> 2724.96
whether it is just altering

2718.84 --> 2727.8500000000004
the the way energy transfers

2724.96 --> 2729.86
it yeah it's a kind of an itch

2727.85 --> 2732.44
experiment concerning the nature of

2729.86 --> 2735.53
light and specific moonlight get when it

2732.44 --> 2738.91
is that could be considered I've worked

2735.53 --> 2738.9100000000003
that out to a scientific level

2741.43 --> 2748.85
social scientists oh

2743.98 --> 2753.37
dear Aries 106 nah no no just theorists

2748.85 --> 2753.37
I like to conceptualize a lot

2753.82 --> 2757.84
it's been a blessing and a curse

2759.36 --> 2762.8900000000003
the great distraction

2768.69 --> 2773.61
[Music]

2771.2 --> 2776.04
no such thing is called energy yeah

2773.61 --> 2779.81
that's right second branches that's my

2776.04 --> 2783.75
point yet there's still widespread

2779.81 --> 2785.27
registry claim doesn't just come out of

2783.75 --> 2789.41
nowhere that

2785.27 --> 2793.47
moonlight is cold so what is this

2789.41 --> 2794.64
this purse evil of cold that's exactly

2793.47 --> 2796.77
what I wanted to find out about

2794.64 --> 2799.68
moonlight and I figured out how to do it

2796.77 --> 2803.58
the very controlled experiment where you

2799.68 --> 2807.3599999999997
have a a box made of Plexiglas so it

2803.58 --> 2810.39
doesn't block light frequencies over the

2807.36 --> 2811.9500000000003
spectrum which glass does right it has

2810.39 --> 2813.15
to be a closed-off box so the

2811.95 --> 2814.7999999999997
temperature could be perfectly

2813.15 --> 2817.86
controlled and then at the same time

2814.8 --> 2821.34
also the soil so there is no temperature

2817.86 --> 2825.6
difference in the soil and the air in

2821.34 --> 2828.1800000000003
the box and then have a roof over it

2825.6 --> 2830.13
that you can remove and let moonlight

2828.18 --> 2833.64
through and then you measure the

2830.13 --> 2837.15
temperature in the soil as the moonlight

2833.64 --> 2841.5899999999997
directly hits that soil through the box

2837.15 --> 2845.09
and then you watch and see if the

2841.59 --> 2850.7400000000002
temperature registered is getting colder

2845.09 --> 2852.48
or not that's a big the big one because

2850.74 --> 2854.4599999999996
it's not about the sensation of coal

2852.48 --> 2857.37
it's about figuring out if there's

2854.46 --> 2859.16
actually cold introduced externally in

2857.37 --> 2862.77
the closed system

2859.16 --> 2863.8799999999997
through the light or if yeah it is

2862.77 --> 2866.1
something else because if the

2863.88 --> 2868.86
temperature doesn't change then my

2866.1 --> 2872.06
theory about it having another effect

2868.86 --> 2876.35
could be correct that it could be the

2872.06 --> 2879.15
enhancement of of heat transfer

2876.35 --> 2884.06
because if heat transfer would be

2879.15 --> 2887.37
enhanced somehow that would move quicker

2884.06 --> 2890.64
then moonlight would effectively cool

2887.37 --> 2893.3399999999997
off the warmer earth which is the normal

2890.64 --> 2895.77
situation on earth in at night because

2893.34 --> 2899.1000000000004
there is always colder then the ground

2895.77 --> 2900.96
especially in the summer so there's heat

2899.1 --> 2902.4
transferring from the ground into the

2900.96 --> 2906.0
air well if the moonlight would hit it

2902.4 --> 2908.13
and it would go rap more rapid would

2906.0 --> 2909.9
cool off more rabbit including yourself

2908.13 --> 2912.81
you have warmth on you and the air is

2909.9 --> 2916.05
outside you is colder at night you would

2912.81 --> 2917.73
cool off quicker and that would be the

2916.05 --> 2922.5800000000004
effect the sensation that will be

2917.73 --> 2924.93
creating the the apparent coldness see

2922.58 --> 2927.3199999999997
you don't have to manipulate the

2924.93 --> 2927.3199999999997
moonlight

2928.04 --> 2932.43
you can

2929.96 --> 2934.86
yea exclude the moon like the basis

2932.43 --> 2935.96
basically in the Box closing off the

2934.86 --> 2940.38
roof again

2935.96 --> 2942.6
or you yeah you and the roof the roof

2940.38 --> 2945.75
means the roof over the plexiglass

2942.6 --> 2947.85
ceiling just so that the light can come

2945.75 --> 2950.43
through and yeah you can very manipulate

2947.85 --> 2952.61
it by moonlight not being over that box

2950.43 --> 2955.23
so there is no light shining into it

2952.61 --> 2957.33
there's all kind so you don't have to

2955.23 --> 2961.08
very manipulate the moon you just have

2957.33 --> 2962.96
to allow light through or not that's the

2961.08 --> 2965.4
variation

2962.96 --> 2968.4
because it's the moonlight that's gifts

2965.4 --> 2970.9100000000003
the effect so you let it in or you don't

2968.4 --> 2970.9100000000003
let it in

2974.09 --> 2980.25
yeah I'm not being very

2976.82 --> 2982.6800000000003
formulaic I'm being very descriptive but

2980.25 --> 2986.09
if I'm correct with everything is stated

2982.68 --> 2986.0899999999997
this should absolutely be

2988.25 --> 2997.44
formula Bo in a scientific and fashion I

2994.22 --> 2999.5699999999997
even talked about it with QE like a

2997.44 --> 3001.81
month ago or something and he did say

2999.57 --> 3004.67
yeah yeah yeah that could work

3001.81 --> 3006.86
it was very skeptical is he always is

3004.67 --> 3009.2200000000003
when somebody brings up signs and any in

3006.86 --> 3009.2200000000003
any way

3011.23 --> 3016.31
night is cold well yeah well you don't

3013.82 --> 3019.55
know you don't know for sure we just

3016.31 --> 3025.11
know that when the moon is out and even

3019.55 --> 3026.79
with like heat vision it is perceived

3025.11 --> 3029.6400000000003
that it is cold there where the

3026.79 --> 3033.36
moonlight hits so yeah what is causing

3029.64 --> 3036.39
that is it the moonlight being cold

3033.36 --> 3038.73
introducing cold energy or is it another

3036.39 --> 3040.74
effect is heat transferring work

3038.73 --> 3043.29
transferring more rapidly where the

3040.74 --> 3045.4799999999996
moonlight hits something because I've

3043.29 --> 3047.19
also heard other weird claims by the way

3045.48 --> 3048.66
that I guess have not confirmed it's a

3047.19 --> 3050.61
one-time claim that I heard it would be

3048.66 --> 3053.16
complete misinformation so don't take

3050.61 --> 3056.13
this it's a permanent data point

3053.16 --> 3058.98
somebody did claim that they kind of

3056.13 --> 3061.53
like magnified moonlight in a giant

3058.98 --> 3064.98
scale I think they use the Sun cooker or

3061.53 --> 3067.98
something they said and that it would

3064.98 --> 3069.7400000000002
actually heat up something instead of

3067.98 --> 3074.25
cool it down so

3069.74 --> 3076.7999999999997
yeah there's another piece of the puzzle

3074.25 --> 3079.02
mystery this is another idea that well

3076.8 --> 3081.4500000000003
maybe if you have enough of this type of

3079.02 --> 3084.69
light that would typically cause a

3081.45 --> 3088.2
cooling of things to cool off more

3084.69 --> 3090.33
rapidly but if enough of it is focused

3088.2 --> 3092.6299999999997
then it will effectively cause heat

3090.33 --> 3092.63
again

3094.76 --> 3101.67
so if it moonlight is claimed cold

3098.3 --> 3105.9300000000003
literally call energy then that that

3101.67 --> 3107.79
claim that if you put in a Sun cooker it

3105.93 --> 3110.25
will actually heat something is

3107.79 --> 3113.72
completely out of the door that but

3110.25 --> 3116.37
still the sensation of coldness is there

3113.72 --> 3119.52
specifically with the moon presence the

3116.37 --> 3121.4
light of Moon present so yeah that's why

3119.52 --> 3124.74
I thought of my

3121.4 --> 3127.76
experiment as to the nature the apparent

3124.74 --> 3127.7599999999998
coldness of moonlight

3128.0 --> 3131.0
right

3135.47 --> 3138.62
[Music]

3140.51 --> 3146.3
now John Smith shut up

3143.38 --> 3148.7200000000003
this is finished talked about so many

3146.3 --> 3148.7200000000003
times

3148.75 --> 3155.14
no experiment could show it was cold

3152.8 --> 3158.09
that's all [ __ ]

3155.14 --> 3159.8799999999997
like what experiment what what

3158.09 --> 3164.75
experiment

3159.88 --> 3168.46
I've just given you a layout of an

3164.75 --> 3171.02
experiment set up very specifically I

3168.46 --> 3172.96
repeated it many times had an episode

3171.02 --> 3175.19
named after it

3172.96 --> 3176.66
months and months and months ago brought

3175.19 --> 3178.06
it up many times some of the Flyers

3176.66 --> 3182.08
debates oh

3178.06 --> 3182.08
yeah what's the problem here

3182.859 --> 3188.6
there's definitely signs that there is

3186.53 --> 3191.48
an apparent cooling effect concerning

3188.6 --> 3192.88
moonlight with visual representation

3191.48 --> 3195.4
heat vision

3192.88 --> 3199.28
personal sensation

3195.4 --> 3201.44
so yeah all these freakin baller excuses

3199.28 --> 3203.8100000000004
just the wind and blah blah blah it's

3201.44 --> 3206.09
all [ __ ] that's the baseless

3203.81 --> 3211.0
assertion you're not the ones actually

3206.09 --> 3213.5
doing it to disprove it at all

3211.0 --> 3215.359
the best I've ever got to see really

3213.5 --> 3216.92
from Palo stood approve this proof to

3215.359 --> 3219.44
suppose the moonlight being cold is

3216.92 --> 3222.19
we're all sketch based well just freakin

3219.44 --> 3225.9700000000003
hypotheticals

3222.19 --> 3225.9700000000003
it's just no

3228.01 --> 3234.82
all right well let me remove you from

3231.05 --> 3234.82
the nonsense echo-chamber then

3235.04 --> 3238.19
[Music]

3238.52 --> 3245.5099999999998
if you're not gonna do it yourself

3240.93 --> 3245.5099999999998
[Music]

3246.8 --> 3250.9100000000003
yeah oh that's very nice Missouri bear

3249.99 --> 3254.81
but

3250.91 --> 3259.2599999999998
Carolyn wheeler it's not really a

3254.81 --> 3260.88
good legitimate source for ya physics

3259.26 --> 3263.01
information as far as I'm concerned

3260.88 --> 3265.04
although I get it he does do interesting

3263.01 --> 3268.1600000000003
things oh

3265.04 --> 3271.2599999999998
thank you la única for the

3268.16 --> 3273.98
two-year-old 29 super chair donation

3271.26 --> 3277.2200000000003
again I support your wound light ex

3273.98 --> 3281.69
go do it our win the I don't have the

3277.22 --> 3284.73
the equipment for that unfortunately

3281.69 --> 3286.619
but yeah look there's so many things

3284.73 --> 3288.3
like as soon as I would get some kind of

3286.619 --> 3289.98
house in the garden there's so many

3288.3 --> 3293.51
things that are on the list of you I'd

3289.98 --> 3296.4900000000002
be preoccupied for 10 years

3293.51 --> 3299.69
all these freaking things that I wanted

3296.49 --> 3303.39
to do and that's gonna be among them

3299.69 --> 3306.6
because I devised this and I'm like this

3303.39 --> 3308.2799999999997
is my thing I came up with this and I

3306.6 --> 3310.5899999999997
definitely want to do it it shouldn't be

3308.28 --> 3313.1090000000004
too hard once I have the space and a

3310.59 --> 3315.4500000000003
little money maneuverability to do

3313.109 --> 3317.88
something like that but at this time

3315.45 --> 3321.3199999999997
it's not gonna happen anytime soon just

3317.88 --> 3321.32
don't have the space and

3322.28 --> 3328.1400000000003
the money anyway thank you for the

3325.47 --> 3331.16
supercharger nation are you okay I'm

3328.14 --> 3331.16
gonna round out the show

3336.14 --> 3343.43
it sounds pretty easy to do oh

3339.549 --> 3345.7
why don't you do it then or don't you

3343.43 --> 3348.499
care you know I

3345.7 --> 3350.5389999999998
devised the experiment that doesn't mean

3348.499 --> 3354.2
that I'm going to forbid anyone else

3350.539 --> 3356.8390000000004
from doing it I've already described the

3354.2 --> 3360.109
exact setting can do it again and again

3356.839 --> 3363.17
and again and again the only thing you

3360.109 --> 3364.509
really need is some space outside that

3363.17 --> 3367.039
is yours and

3364.509 --> 3371.499
undisturbed where you can build a little

3367.039 --> 3373.94
or a little a big enough box

3371.499 --> 3378.109
that's going to be hermetically sealed

3373.94 --> 3380.509
with plexiglass the right type that

3378.109 --> 3384.2
would not interfere with light

3380.509 --> 3385.91
frequencies getting through them some

3384.2 --> 3389.0789999999997
kind of cover I don't know it could be

3385.91 --> 3389.0789999999997
very basic just a

3389.349 --> 3393.039
just a sheet of something non

3391.4 --> 3396.4100000000003
transparent and

3393.039 --> 3398.329
yeah the tougher things is going to be

3396.41 --> 3399.6499999999996
how are you going to check the tip how

3398.329 --> 3401.69
are you going to keep the temperature in

3399.65 --> 3403.5190000000002
there stable I don't know a direct

3401.69 --> 3405.65
answer to that temper I like how do you

3403.519 --> 3407.4399999999996
achieve perfect temperature control in

3405.65 --> 3410.38
some way

3407.44 --> 3415.239
without having constant air circulation

3410.38 --> 3418.9990000000003
that would distort the readings

3415.239 --> 3420.44
well yeah I'll get to that when I'll get

3418.999 --> 3422.6899999999996
to that maybe somebody else will figure

3420.44 --> 3425.239
that out but anyway I'm gonna round out

3422.69 --> 3427.279
to show now for real so thanks everyone

3425.239 --> 3428.839
for coming I hope you like to show if

3427.279 --> 3429.949
you did please don't forget to Rogen's

3428.839 --> 3431.509

3459.44 --> 3466.69
debates right now it's already started

3461.329 --> 3471.069
up a hashtag meifa indeed over moco and
