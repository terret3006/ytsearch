83.119 --> 90.08
so yeah the weather today is

87.2 --> 90.08
very clouded

92.159 --> 99.759
and the clouds are rushing

95.28 --> 102.88
by up there as well i don't know

99.759 --> 102.88
cam can pick that up

104.64 --> 110.88
so these giant billowing clouds are

107.68 --> 113.68
moving around here and there and

110.88 --> 115.03999999999999
yesterday again there was this giant

113.68 --> 117.84
waterfall of a

115.04 --> 117.84
rainstorm

122.0 --> 127.92
but it doesn't last super long though

125.52 --> 129.039
it's just like a big bucket of water

127.92 --> 132.48
comes out of the sky

129.039 --> 135.27999999999997
and then it stops again after

132.48 --> 135.28
a few minutes

135.599 --> 143.83999999999997
right anyway it's

138.64 --> 143.83999999999997
not super warm

144.51 --> 151.04
[Music]

146.4 --> 153.519
hey iron 26 first in chat

151.04 --> 153.519
agm

155.599 --> 158.39999999999998
tom parker

163.599 --> 170.879
okay so today's show is gonna be

167.84 --> 173.36
a little bit more calm i hope

170.879 --> 176.07999999999998
because yesterday's show i didn't even

173.36 --> 176.08
watch it back

177.519 --> 181.92000000000002
but it was a really weird experience

182.08 --> 185.84
even just remembering it all

186.0 --> 189.68
and i discussed it a little with adam

187.92 --> 194.159
meekin

189.68 --> 197.20000000000002
afterward and i got the feeling

194.159 --> 199.76
like maybe maybe yesterday's theme

197.2 --> 202.39999999999998
actually did apply to me

199.76 --> 203.12
like somewhere in the middle of it i did

202.4 --> 207.20000000000002
kind of like

203.12 --> 212.64000000000001
roll out a a golem act

207.2 --> 218.07999999999998
but then i was really thinking like yeah

212.64 --> 218.07999999999998
but it really is that in a way

220.08 --> 223.76000000000002
because i just i don't know i was

221.599 --> 227.0
infused by

223.76 --> 230.239
just this dreaded sense of

227.0 --> 230.239
dissatisfaction and

235.439 --> 238.959
and i've been thinking a lot about what

237.2 --> 242.48
i said like i

238.959 --> 244.64000000000001
i want recognition

242.48 --> 246.319
and it really is like this really deep

244.64 --> 250.48
in

246.319 --> 254.07999999999998
desire that has really been there

250.48 --> 259.59999999999997
from the very start in my life

254.08 --> 259.6
and for some reason

259.68 --> 269.84000000000003
at times like my focus gets

264.96 --> 269.84
touches it

271.84 --> 274.4
okay

280.32 --> 284.96999999999997
okay my internet got disconnected

284.56 --> 288.049
again

284.97 --> 288.04900000000004
[Music]

289.04 --> 300.24
yeah i think it's back

296.479 --> 302.8
right so great that just broke my train

300.24 --> 305.919
of thinking

302.8 --> 310.08
first like some boy i think is like

305.919 --> 312.32
what is it eight it's holding a net

310.08 --> 313.199
running after a little girl and that

312.32 --> 315.52
little girl

313.199 --> 317.12
was running away screaming and that that

315.52 --> 317.44
is kind of what we heard then and then

317.12 --> 322.0
my

317.44 --> 322.0
internet connection suddenly broke

322.84 --> 325.84
okay

326.32 --> 328.71999999999997
right

330.96 --> 337.28
but yes this urge for need of

334.479 --> 337.28
recognition

337.36 --> 343.039
in relation to kind of like the

340.56 --> 345.6
general sense of isolation that i go

343.039 --> 345.59999999999997
through a lot

346.88 --> 351.44
doing what i do trying to think and

349.759 --> 354.16
develop

351.44 --> 355.68
and then ending up that just kind of

354.16 --> 358.72
dissatisfied about

355.68 --> 363.6
like why isn't the world catching on to

358.72 --> 366.88000000000005
what i do like hurry it up already

363.6 --> 369.759
right all these things these feelings

366.88 --> 369.759
from the inside

375.44 --> 378.88
but then if you would wait off the

377.36 --> 381.68
practical result like

378.88 --> 382.319
yes somebody did say eventually in chat

381.68 --> 384.319
fame

382.319 --> 385.68
like yeah who the hell wants fame like i

384.319 --> 388.72
don't really want

385.68 --> 391.28000000000003
fame like that and even when i was

388.72 --> 394.88000000000005
younger i realized that very much

391.28 --> 397.67999999999995
like fame is completely useless

394.88 --> 398.24
it's the only thing about it that might

397.68 --> 399.919
appeal

398.24 --> 401.6
is the grass is greener on the other

399.919 --> 405.68
side effect

401.6 --> 405.68
because once you get there it's really

406.84 --> 411.19899999999996
annoying

409.12 --> 412.8
what speeds are you getting it no has

411.199 --> 413.36
nothing to do with the internet speed

412.8 --> 417.199
it's just

413.36 --> 420.96000000000004
subtly disconnecting completely

417.199 --> 421.28000000000003
like i can't pinpoint why really really

420.96 --> 424.71999999999997
can

421.28 --> 428.4
sometimes it just does it

424.72 --> 432.0
get this weird feeling like there is a

428.4 --> 434.15999999999997
conscious influence on the outside

432.0 --> 435.52
choosing to use that moment to screw

434.16 --> 440.0
around on purpose

435.52 --> 442.96
right and it happens

440.0 --> 442.96
every now and then

444.0 --> 448.319
especially in these moments where

445.84 --> 451.52
certainly yeah i get carried away

448.319 --> 455.28000000000003
from the inside with like these really

451.52 --> 457.35999999999996
inner feelings that are also ego related

455.28 --> 465.28
and then this sort of [ __ ] typically had

457.36 --> 467.599
it happened yesterday

465.28 --> 469.84
right but yeah tom parker i don't know

467.599 --> 472.87899999999996
the literal speed i think it's like five

469.84 --> 472.87899999999996
megabit a second

474.24 --> 479.84000000000003
optimally it's never really much worse

480.319 --> 494.96000000000004
things download pretty quickly

492.0 --> 498.8
all right it's all landline based so

494.96 --> 498.79999999999995
that's always going to be fast here

504.84 --> 507.84
right

514.56 --> 519.4399999999999
right so yeah actual fame is completely

518.0 --> 522.56
useless

519.44 --> 524.72
and then there is another reason

522.56 --> 526.959
one that i also kind of don't want to

524.72 --> 526.9590000000001
know

527.36 --> 532.32
why i don't get this recognition why

530.08 --> 534.08
things don't connect

532.32 --> 535.6
more smoothly and that is because

534.08 --> 537.279
there's a whole bunch of people out

535.6 --> 540.399
there

537.279 --> 549.4399999999999
that kind of did go for fame or

540.399 --> 552.72
control and they don't care

549.44 --> 555.7600000000001
they just do what they do

552.72 --> 558.5600000000001
and they don't really like to give out

555.76 --> 558.56
recognition

559.2 --> 565.2
to some so things out there they don't

561.36 --> 565.2
really feel like they have control over

568.64 --> 576.3199999999999
right back in the old days

573.36 --> 577.6800000000001
it would be like the shill effect it's

576.32 --> 579.7600000000001
like okay they are

577.68 --> 582.4799999999999
partially shield because they don't just

579.76 --> 582.48
fluidly

583.839 --> 590.5600000000001
honestly do [ __ ] they play weird

587.04 --> 593.4399999999999
personal politics games right

590.56 --> 595.1199999999999
that's also a big reason why i don't get

593.44 --> 598.48
this recognition and

595.12 --> 600.0
adam actually had to indirectly remind

598.48 --> 602.16
me of that

600.0 --> 604.88
and i was like shocked hearing it

602.16 --> 608.0
because i had forgotten

604.88 --> 612.56
it's like i blanked it out

608.0 --> 615.2
because i just i can't handle how easily

612.56 --> 618.8
corruptable humans are sometimes

615.2 --> 623.12
i guess it's my elven nature to not

618.8 --> 623.12
accept that as a reality in a way

628.56 --> 632.56
right you missed yesterday's stream wow

632.24 --> 635.44
you

632.56 --> 637.279
well you missed quite a ranty uh

635.44 --> 639.519
[Music]

637.279 --> 639.519
no

640.959 --> 644.2399999999999
you missed quite a passionate stream i

642.88 --> 647.8389999999999
was

644.24 --> 647.839
like almost out of control

649.04 --> 652.079
and seems i wasn't the only one because

650.959 --> 655.92
here we go again

652.079 --> 656.399
after a month certainly decided to show

655.92 --> 661.04
up and

656.399 --> 664.56
shove like the worst imaginable garbage

661.04 --> 666.959
you could get from her right there

664.56 --> 668.88
as a first comment in the chat and i

666.959 --> 674.16
like immediately banned her and

668.88 --> 678.56
gave her like a very harsh tongue

674.16 --> 678.56
so it was all riled up and

680.0 --> 684.16
yeah me getting pissed off

684.399 --> 687.44
and yelling about how i want recognition

687.12 --> 689.6
for

687.44 --> 690.6400000000001
and i did name it i did name the list

689.6 --> 693.76
this is stuff that

690.64 --> 696.24
is on my mind this is what i built

693.76 --> 697.6
and i just feel sometimes like why am i

696.24 --> 701.2
doing this

697.6 --> 702.72
why am i a wizard building the virtual

701.2 --> 705.2
cosmogeny

702.72 --> 706.48
to a consistent level for the entirety

705.2 --> 709.36
of humanity

706.48 --> 712.0
when most other people that sort of seem

709.36 --> 715.92
to engage

712.0 --> 716.959
like they they don't even start square

715.92 --> 719.5999999999999
one

716.959 --> 720.6389999999999
they're just building stories most of

719.6 --> 722.72
the time that they

720.639 --> 724.48
themselves don't fully understand and

722.72 --> 728.0
they spend more time on

724.48 --> 729.04
saying it in a convincing fluid way so

728.0 --> 732.72
you don't

729.04 --> 733.5999999999999
inquire like they spend more time on

732.72 --> 736.1600000000001
that

733.6 --> 739.12
than on the actual understanding and

736.16 --> 745.8389999999999
relaying it through explanation

739.12 --> 745.839
and that pisses me off

747.6 --> 753.87
but i'm not gonna get all angry today

750.76 --> 753.87
[Music]

756.72 --> 759.839
and it was a long show like two and a

759.04 --> 762.079
half hours

759.839 --> 767.0400000000001
there was no life flat earth debates and

762.079 --> 767.04
that also contributed to my frustration

768.399 --> 772.16
because i don't like it when nathan just

770.16 --> 775.76
suddenly doesn't show up

772.16 --> 775.76
during live show times

778.079 --> 783.1999999999999
all right be careful you may blow your

782.8 --> 787.8389999999999
sp

783.2 --> 787.839
i wasn't that bad george sanford come on

807.12 --> 813.839
right also yeah i could

810.959 --> 815.5189999999999
even answer some of the questions that

813.839 --> 817.44
were on my mind then

815.519 --> 819.44
in that stream i i guess i'll be

817.44 --> 821.44
reflecting on yesterday's stream some

819.44 --> 824.639
more during this one

821.44 --> 826.32
because it is i really put down a lot of

824.639 --> 829.12
energy in many ways

826.32 --> 829.7600000000001
and i put down a puzzle for myself like

829.12 --> 833.519
literally

829.76 --> 836.8
afterward i was like yes

833.519 --> 836.8
i made it like this

837.279 --> 841.68
and this is the perspective and then i

839.6 --> 842.0
stepped away from it and it's like holy

841.68 --> 846.16
[ __ ]

842.0 --> 848.24
but if i face it like halfway then

846.16 --> 851.92
suddenly everything is turned around and

848.24 --> 854.72
it's actually quite ridiculous

851.92 --> 856.4799999999999
like me throwing out things that i

854.72 --> 858.88
literally even proved i

856.48 --> 860.32
know better than that but i couldn't

858.88 --> 864.079
stop it

860.32 --> 866.8000000000001
it was quite bizarre to realize all that

864.079 --> 867.8389999999999
and then also just the nature of

866.8 --> 871.68
expression

867.839 --> 873.7600000000001
and putting down things with feelings

871.68 --> 875.279
from that perspective in a moment and

873.76 --> 878.399
then

875.279 --> 879.36
afterward only seeing the wider

878.399 --> 882.56
connections

879.36 --> 884.88
even though i did feel it i like i

882.56 --> 888.6389999999999
knew the wider connections i had a grip

884.88 --> 890.48
over fractal thinking as i was doing it

888.639 --> 892.48
but there were still things about it

890.48 --> 893.6
blanked out and i guess that was needed

892.48 --> 895.12
otherwise i wouldn't

893.6 --> 896.88
have been able to do it i would have

895.12 --> 899.92
crashed and kind of been like guys i

896.88 --> 903.04
have to stop now and

899.92 --> 906.04
but i didn't i choose i

903.04 --> 907.519
guess i chose to blank out certain

906.04 --> 909.92
realizations

907.519 --> 910.72
as i was doing it so i was would be able

909.92 --> 912.639
to put down

910.72 --> 914.1600000000001
something at least from an honest

912.639 --> 916.5600000000001
perspective and it was all

914.16 --> 916.56
honest

923.36 --> 933.44
what's the worst blow up you've had life

928.0 --> 933.44
well 82 that's blatantly obvious

939.68 --> 942.7199999999999
no i don't really blow up anymore but i

942.32 --> 944.8000000000001
get

942.72 --> 947.38
like sometimes i get a little blood

944.8 --> 949.519
thirsty almost like that like ah

947.38 --> 952.639
[Music]

949.519 --> 956.32
am i gonna get like basically

952.639 --> 959.36
start attacking anything that's off

956.32 --> 960.88
right in front of me like that i get

959.36 --> 964.5600000000001
like that a little

960.88 --> 965.4399999999999
so this guy a person is his account name

964.56 --> 967.4399999999999
like he came in

965.44 --> 969.519
and i thought like you were a troll and

967.44 --> 970.8800000000001
like immediately started attacking him

969.519 --> 972.5600000000001
over the choice of his name

970.88 --> 975.279
like how dare you try to be anonymous

972.56 --> 980.0
you think blah blah blah blah

975.279 --> 982.639
like he sent me a comment afterward

980.0 --> 984.88
like a really long comment super

982.639 --> 988.0
supportive and like explaining

984.88 --> 990.16
very like

988.0 --> 992.399
amazingly like yeah i really want to

990.16 --> 994.56
stay anonymous i really

992.399 --> 995.6
i'm sorry and i think you're doing a

994.56 --> 998.8
great job and i was like

995.6 --> 1001.9200000000001
holy [ __ ] dude sorry man

998.8 --> 1004.24
you you wrap you right rolled in right

1001.92 --> 1004.24
there

1005.04 --> 1009.04
when i was troll hunting and i totally

1008.0 --> 1012.8
gave

1009.04 --> 1016.24
yeah gave you gave you a hard time

1012.8 --> 1016.24
when you didn't really deserve it

1018.079 --> 1026.6399999999999
so yeah that does happen too

1021.12 --> 1026.64
weird how about i do tom parker i

1027.12 --> 1035.52
who cares my show is not about oh

1031.52 --> 1038.8799999999999
look at all the times irwin got angry

1035.52 --> 1041.76
because all of that anger if you don't

1038.88 --> 1043.439
if you don't focus on the context it's

1041.76 --> 1047.039
just

1043.439 --> 1053.8400000000001
energy that doesn't have any purpose

1047.039 --> 1053.84
that you can't really connect to what

1060.88 --> 1066.72
i don't remember second best blow up

1064.799 --> 1068.8799999999999
i think that all of the other times have

1066.72 --> 1071.84
been pretty persistent

1068.88 --> 1072.16
like when i do get pissed off i i kind

1071.84 --> 1075.4399999999998
of

1072.16 --> 1078.24
uphold the same level

1075.44 --> 1078.88
right and 82 really was the exception

1078.24 --> 1081.52
where i

1078.88 --> 1082.0
actively took that lid off and said like

1081.52 --> 1085.6
okay

1082.0 --> 1086.559
now it's unlimited now i'm gonna go

1085.6 --> 1090.08
completely

1086.559 --> 1090.08
berserk and i did

1092.72 --> 1098.08
but i'm not doing that anymore i did

1094.799 --> 1100.8799999999999
that really for demonstration purposes

1098.08 --> 1104.08
in a way and i said it i even said it

1100.88 --> 1106.88
and talked about it afterward

1104.08 --> 1108.0
it was really nerve-wracking to done to

1106.88 --> 1112.72
do that to have

1108.0 --> 1116.08
done that because i did feel like wow

1112.72 --> 1119.52
that's total mental case right

1116.08 --> 1120.48
and i did get like severe troll waves

1119.52 --> 1124.32
over it like they

1120.48 --> 1124.32
they really thought they had me

1125.2 --> 1128.96
and in a way they did but

1129.28 --> 1132.48
it was all still natural and i had been

1131.76 --> 1136.64
able to

1132.48 --> 1139.679
ever since reflect upon it in an honest

1136.64 --> 1142.3200000000002
learning way so

1139.679 --> 1144.72
on the long run it's nothing but a a

1142.32 --> 1144.72
basic

1145.12 --> 1150.0
wars car and that's doable that just

1148.96 --> 1152.88
proves like yeah

1150.0 --> 1156.32
that happened but i learned from it it's

1152.88 --> 1156.3200000000002
not gonna happen like that again

1159.76 --> 1178.08
nor we didn't meet you no i didn't see

1163.12 --> 1181.12
that bad karma

1178.08 --> 1181.12
from space

1182.559 --> 1187.44
nothing comes from space space doesn't

1190.84 --> 1193.84
exist

1199.36 --> 1204.1589999999999
so guys yeah i don't know there should

1202.4 --> 1206.0
be a live show

1204.159 --> 1208.3200000000002
flatter debates today i don't know

1206.0 --> 1208.32
though

1211.2 --> 1215.3600000000001
nathan hasn't announced there wouldn't

1212.96 --> 1218.559
be a show today so

1215.36 --> 1220.08
take it he will just start in about an

1218.559 --> 1221.6789999999999
hour 10 minutes

1220.08 --> 1223.6
it was quite spectacular yeah well i

1221.679 --> 1235.8400000000001
didn't see it so

1223.6 --> 1235.84
i guess i'll google it then

1244.159 --> 1252.96
okay what's this

1249.44 --> 1255.28
oh god get out

1252.96 --> 1255.28
uh

1258.64 --> 1265.539
oh oh gosh

1262.51 --> 1265.539
[Music]

1277.28 --> 1282.24
i mean what more can you want then for a

1280.08 --> 1286.1589999999999
less than a minute video

1282.24 --> 1286.159
to have an ads of half a minute

1289.76 --> 1292.08
okay

1295.2 --> 1297.76
that's it

1299.12 --> 1308.32
whoa that is kind of fascinating though

1304.64 --> 1308.3200000000002
especially from one angle

1316.84 --> 1322.3999999999999
huh

1319.44 --> 1324.0
that is that is remarkable especially

1322.4 --> 1327.1200000000001
how it

1324.0 --> 1329.36
how it flashed as intensely the last

1327.12 --> 1332.9189999999999
moment

1329.36 --> 1346.9599999999998
yeah that is interesting i've seen more

1332.919 --> 1350.7990000000002
spectacular ones though but

1346.96 --> 1351.76
hey charles dewmux long time no speak

1350.799 --> 1355.28
you say i

1351.76 --> 1355.28
sorry i don't recognize you

1355.36 --> 1358.9599999999998
unless it's like from the flat earth

1357.36 --> 1362.8799999999999
talks days i don't remember

1358.96 --> 1362.88
anyone from there like i don't

1363.679 --> 1367.44
the crowd has definitely refreshed since

1366.48 --> 1369.6
then but hey

1367.44 --> 1372.559
back then i didn't really know what my

1369.6 --> 1372.559
crowd even was

1372.84 --> 1375.84
right

1386.559 --> 1391.6
karen sun and moon oh okay yeah that is

1389.36 --> 1395.039
from way in the beginning

1391.6 --> 1403.039
that's even before the

1395.039 --> 1406.799
flat earth early bird show days

1403.039 --> 1406.799
i did a couple of shows with them

1407.76 --> 1415.28
but i i got into trouble because

1411.039 --> 1418.48
it was just slow

1415.28 --> 1423.12
it was too slow for me at times

1418.48 --> 1425.52
i was like oh somebody's wrong

1423.12 --> 1427.76
you can't disagree with them and that

1425.52 --> 1430.96
was the time when i was like okay this

1427.76 --> 1433.6
is this hippie circle [ __ ]

1430.96 --> 1436.64
i'm done with it i'm gonna i want

1433.6 --> 1438.8799999999999
something more serious

1436.64 --> 1440.24
and hey the flat earth debates came at

1438.88 --> 1445.8400000000001
came along

1440.24 --> 1445.84
so that was like yeah that was perfect

1448.96 --> 1454.88
man that's a that's a long time ago so

1452.159 --> 1459.8400000000001
much has happened since then

1454.88 --> 1459.8400000000001
right anyway yeah good to have you back

1462.88 --> 1469.6000000000001
what show number did

1466.24 --> 1473.84
charles do wait are you asking

1469.6 --> 1477.279
what oh flat earth debate uh

1473.84 --> 1477.279
i don't know very early

1479.44 --> 1482.799
but i kind of avoided it at first

1482.24 --> 1485.679
because

1482.799 --> 1486.08
it was just baller trolls at the time

1485.679 --> 1489.3600000000001
getting

1486.08 --> 1489.36
very annoying and just

1489.6 --> 1493.039
they remember in that time like all

1492.0 --> 1495.52
ballers were just

1493.039 --> 1496.48
constantly publicly shaming flat

1495.52 --> 1498.72
earthers

1496.48 --> 1500.96
just that was the constant thing they

1498.72 --> 1505.1200000000001
were constantly bullying

1500.96 --> 1507.44
like now they it doesn't work anymore

1505.12 --> 1508.4799999999998
but back then it kind of did and that

1507.44 --> 1511.679
was very

1508.48 --> 1513.52
annoying and that's why

1511.679 --> 1516.72
right at the start i didn't really join

1513.52 --> 1518.8799999999999
it was all too much ballerish for me

1516.72 --> 1519.919
i was still kind of in the middle of a

1518.88 --> 1522.48
phase where

1519.919 --> 1523.6000000000001
we were all or i was at least looking

1522.48 --> 1525.679
for

1523.6 --> 1526.7199999999998
flat earth safe spaces where we could

1525.679 --> 1530.5590000000002
finally be left

1526.72 --> 1534.08
alone by these nagging ballers

1530.559 --> 1537.6
because back in the day

1534.08 --> 1539.84
there there weren't enough people

1537.6 --> 1541.76
there weren't enough people and flat

1539.84 --> 1544.0
earth

1541.76 --> 1545.6
spaces i guess sounds really silly to

1544.0 --> 1547.039
say it like that but it is effectively

1545.6 --> 1550.0
what it was

1547.039 --> 1550.96
now it's different now flat earth has

1550.0 --> 1554.0
really spread

1550.96 --> 1556.799
out much wider

1554.0 --> 1557.12
and the ballers are not as nagging while

1556.799 --> 1559.039
they

1557.12 --> 1561.52
are still are it just doesn't work

1559.039 --> 1563.44
anymore

1561.52 --> 1565.76
we've dismantled so many of their

1563.44 --> 1569.679
machinations so they now

1565.76 --> 1572.32
continue more on bluff than on some

1569.679 --> 1575.52
virtual win because we don't understand

1572.32 --> 1578.0
that's the difference so i think i

1575.52 --> 1581.039
joined somewhere what is it

1578.0 --> 1581.039
in the first hundred

1581.6 --> 1585.84
i don't remember exactly

1588.96 --> 1599.8400000000001
yeah ask nathan he might remember

1592.799 --> 1599.84
which one it was

1607.36 --> 1613.84
the teabagging has made them soar

1614.64 --> 1617.039
right

1619.2 --> 1622.24
i'm still officially disagreeing though

1621.6 --> 1625.52
with

1622.24 --> 1628.559
nathan's anti-rumpus policy

1625.52 --> 1628.559
because he like

1628.64 --> 1636.72
oh really rumpus is lying

1631.679 --> 1641.279
and that's a reason like oh really

1636.72 --> 1644.48
uh they all lie

1641.279 --> 1645.279
they just they all lie to themselves

1644.48 --> 1648.32
it's just that

1645.279 --> 1650.399
when they hold on to that like even when

1648.32 --> 1655.84
driven in a corner

1650.399 --> 1655.84
then they'll just like really lie

1656.08 --> 1660.1589999999999
and they'll stick to it yeah that's what

1657.76 --> 1663.6
they all do so i

1660.159 --> 1664.7990000000002
nathan nathan i know you are trying to

1663.6 --> 1668.08
make a step maybe it

1664.799 --> 1671.52
is really just like a very very serious

1668.08 --> 1676.399
timeout like hey rumpus

1671.52 --> 1676.399
don't overkill what you're doing because

1677.679 --> 1684.72
yeah rumpus has been like a valuable

1681.2 --> 1687.8400000000001
opponent asset for his enthusiasm

1684.72 --> 1692.799
and for his well

1687.84 --> 1694.799
his mechanical savviness

1692.799 --> 1695.84
and including machinations by the way

1694.799 --> 1698.96
right but it's been an

1695.84 --> 1702.0
interesting opponent so i really hope

1698.96 --> 1705.2
that nathan at some point is gonna like

1702.0 --> 1707.679
let him out of the cage again and

1705.2 --> 1707.679
continue

1707.919 --> 1713.76
i i don't i don't fully understand

1710.64 --> 1713.76
nathan's motives for it

1715.36 --> 1722.24
because uh yeah like with romp

1719.2 --> 1725.52
it's just the funniest moments ever

1722.24 --> 1729.84
and like he never backs away in the

1725.52 --> 1732.559
in the hottest of moments and that is

1729.84 --> 1732.559
i don't know that

1736.72 --> 1739.84
that's worth tolerating

1740.24 --> 1746.799
blatant idiocy and just dark

1743.36 --> 1749.84
lies for even it's like everything

1746.799 --> 1753.84
at some point just will contribute to

1749.84 --> 1756.08
the art of that situation

1753.84 --> 1757.84
you miss him to be honest yeah it was so

1756.08 --> 1760.399
do i

1757.84 --> 1762.559
and if you tell him you miss him he'll

1760.399 --> 1764.84
just immediately scoff at you and get

1762.559 --> 1765.84
very pissed off when he doesn't realize

1764.84 --> 1767.9189999999999
that you

1765.84 --> 1770.24
actually miss it that yeah did you

1767.919 --> 1772.3990000000001
actually mean it

1770.24 --> 1773.36
you just think you're just being like a

1772.399 --> 1777.039
baller

1773.36 --> 1780.9599999999998
to a flat earther like oh we miss you

1777.039 --> 1785.039
no no actually romp it sounds crazy

1780.96 --> 1787.679
but in a way we do miss you but

1785.039 --> 1789.52
for reasons that will permanently elude

1787.679 --> 1790.3990000000001
you because of the way your

1789.52 --> 1794.6399999999999
consciousness

1790.399 --> 1797.9189999999999
is gone to function in your predicament

1794.64 --> 1801.039
that you can never understand why we

1797.919 --> 1801.039
actually miss you

1802.0 --> 1806.88
but when we say it it's not sarcastic or

1804.88 --> 1808.48
maybe for some it is maybe some people

1806.88 --> 1811.3600000000001
out there like really

1808.48 --> 1812.3990000000001
can't stand to hear him ramble and

1811.36 --> 1814.6399999999999
stutter

1812.399 --> 1815.6
they just can't stand it they can't find

1814.64 --> 1818.24
the funny

1815.6 --> 1818.24
side of that

1818.799 --> 1823.84
i get it

1834.84 --> 1837.84
oh

1848.84 --> 1851.84
fine

1856.64 --> 1858.96
right

1863.84 --> 1868.799
and rumpus is a hilarious character

1866.0 --> 1871.519
anyway because he gets into trouble with

1868.799 --> 1871.519
everybody

1872.0 --> 1876.159
it's always rumpus against everybody

1876.84 --> 1879.84
nowadays

1890.84 --> 1894.8799999999999
anyway so

1897.76 --> 1904.72
what's going on out there there was a

1900.64 --> 1904.72
meteor in norway apparently

1904.84 --> 1920.399
so i just got told

1907.76 --> 1924.399
in chat

1920.399 --> 1924.399
so i'm watching a movie of sorts

1925.919 --> 1931.039
no wait oh yeah no i

1929.2 --> 1933.279
i remember that yeah i got stuck on

1931.039 --> 1937.76
playing a video game

1933.279 --> 1937.76
like oh an older one

1938.0 --> 1943.76
and i guess it really wasn't a

1939.36 --> 1946.559
reflection upon just the stressfulness

1943.76 --> 1946.8799999999999
of yesterday's show because i eventually

1946.559 --> 1949.36
like

1946.88 --> 1950.0800000000002
ended up like being like uh what time is

1949.36 --> 1953.9189999999999
it

1950.08 --> 1957.4399999999998
five in the morning like oh [ __ ]

1953.919 --> 1960.96
i got really zoned into doing that

1957.44 --> 1963.3600000000001
but it was entertaining it doesn't feel

1960.96 --> 1965.919
like i had like i've burdened my body

1963.36 --> 1965.9189999999999
doing that

1969.679 --> 1977.6000000000001
still got enough rest thankfully

1973.039 --> 1981.519
and i'm a lot calmer now

1977.6 --> 1990.75
hello x 32 100

1981.519 --> 1992.32
no wait 320.

1990.75 --> 1995.6
[Music]

1992.32 --> 1995.6
what is the temperature

1997.679 --> 2008.0
i think it'd cool off check it

2004.32 --> 2008.0
oh yeah 19 degrees

2017.2 --> 2020.96
no no snacks for today

2025.279 --> 2033.84
did i have something yeah

2034.0 --> 2047.84
okay let me check

2058.839 --> 2061.839
so

2086.839 --> 2089.839
nope

2100.56 --> 2103.92
you think that trump says nathan's

2102.48 --> 2106.0
nemesis

2103.92 --> 2108.56
i'm pretty sure that rompus likes to

2106.0 --> 2108.56
think so

2109.839 --> 2113.92
who's to say he isn't my nemesis

2115.44 --> 2122.4
you know i try to be like

2118.839 --> 2125.92
multi-angle unlimited fractal

2122.4 --> 2127.76
cosmogenist he likes to be

2125.92 --> 2129.28
well what seems like the complete

2127.76 --> 2132.6400000000003
opposite

2129.28 --> 2132.6400000000003
total nonsense world

2137.92 --> 2145.44
like i literally emulate a baller

2142.16 --> 2147.5989999999997
that is originally me like i was like

2145.44 --> 2147.599
that

2147.76 --> 2154.2400000000002
right nathan

2151.119 --> 2154.2400000000002
doesn't even do that

2156.839 --> 2159.839
right

2169.72 --> 2173.839
impenetrable to the tea bags

2174.0 --> 2186.48
well he has slippery skin like

2175.92 --> 2188.64
everything just deflects

2186.48 --> 2190.56
like i wonder like i i really wonder

2188.64 --> 2191.68
sometimes like more about rumpus like

2190.56 --> 2194.7999999999997
where did he grow up

2191.68 --> 2197.04
like did he grow up in a family where

2194.8 --> 2197.599
there was always arguing or something

2197.04 --> 2199.52
and like

2197.599 --> 2200.6400000000003
parents were constantly screaming and

2199.52 --> 2202.4
kids

2200.64 --> 2204.3199999999997
brothers and sisters were constantly

2202.4 --> 2205.599
running around and looking for fights

2204.32 --> 2209.28
and then he's just like

2205.599 --> 2211.44
used to people going ape [ __ ] around him

2209.28 --> 2213.0400000000004
and that's how he just lets it all slide

2211.44 --> 2216.4
off him or something

2213.04 --> 2220.64
right but it is really remarkable how

2216.4 --> 2220.64
easily he can let it all bounce off

2226.0 --> 2229.92
all right but that's all just divining

2228.56 --> 2232.72
about

2229.92 --> 2235.599
who he is when he's not even revealed

2232.72 --> 2237.9199999999996
his identity so

2235.599 --> 2239.2000000000003
only thing we have of his him is his

2237.92 --> 2243.119
voice

2239.2 --> 2246.3999999999996
that's it

2243.119 --> 2246.4
hey dusty ryder

2246.56 --> 2250.4
yeah thanks thanks for popping by

2255.52 --> 2259.44
how are the herbs going by the way

2257.28 --> 2259.8390000000004
ex-320 yeah they're doing great i showed

2259.44 --> 2263.68
them

2259.839 --> 2265.68
the other day show them off

2263.68 --> 2267.7599999999998
yeah i know all plants right now are

2265.68 --> 2270.96
doing great because there's been well

2267.76 --> 2274.0
plenty of rain

2270.96 --> 2276.96
and and sun

2274.0 --> 2279.68
in between so everything is growing

2276.96 --> 2279.68
pretty fast

2280.64 --> 2284.48
there's a lot of like garden workers

2283.359 --> 2287.52
going around

2284.48 --> 2289.599
doing maintenance all over the place

2287.52 --> 2291.68
periodically now because yeah there's

2289.599 --> 2292.8
everything is growing pretty fast lots

2291.68 --> 2296.16
of moist lots of

2292.8 --> 2296.1600000000003
sun it'll do that

2296.839 --> 2299.839
right

2306.96 --> 2313.839
nathan is unhealthy to me

2310.0 --> 2313.839
what does that mean

2317.44 --> 2320.16
you mean that

2320.56 --> 2326.16
he may have moments where he's looking

2323.76 --> 2326.4
down upon me in a social setting is that

2326.16 --> 2329.44
it

2326.4 --> 2329.44
acts 3 and 20

2330.48 --> 2337.92
right there may be some truth to that

2334.079 --> 2341.8390000000004
but hey i do stick up for myself

2337.92 --> 2341.839
like he knows

2345.28 --> 2350.4
he knows if he pushes it too far or

2348.16 --> 2355.839
starts taking things for granted i

2350.4 --> 2355.839
i will let me call that

2359.2 --> 2363.7599999999998
i will make my counter moves this is

2364.0 --> 2370.88
like i i don't just take [ __ ]

2367.04 --> 2383.839
and leave it i like

2370.88 --> 2383.839
i can't find the right word for it

2390.24 --> 2393.359
what is it called again

2393.76 --> 2398.0
when yeah you're typically like somebody

2396.079 --> 2401.92
that

2398.0 --> 2404.16
remembers things for a very long time if

2401.92 --> 2406.0
like somebody did something to them they

2404.16 --> 2409.1189999999997
will remember that

2406.0 --> 2412.16
and they'll like never forget that right

2409.119 --> 2412.1600000000003
that sort of thing

2413.68 --> 2425.839
what's it called again

2426.24 --> 2432.8799999999997
five foot tomato plant a grudge right

2429.839 --> 2435.68
yeah yeah that's the word thanks

2432.88 --> 2435.6800000000003
dusty writer

2437.359 --> 2445.839
like i am not a grudgeful person

2442.72 --> 2446.9599999999996
the problem is within my social

2445.839 --> 2451.44
interactions

2446.96 --> 2454.48
i have to hold grudges i must

2451.44 --> 2456.96
because if i don't i'll start to accept

2454.48 --> 2459.76
everything and let people walk over me

2456.96 --> 2464.0
completely with glee

2459.76 --> 2466.96
yeah sounds kind of crazy right well

2464.0 --> 2469.04
that's why i had to instate holding

2466.96 --> 2471.76
grudges

2469.04 --> 2472.56
i had to let my ego latch onto that

2471.76 --> 2476.6400000000003
mechanism

2472.56 --> 2479.599
for self-defense because otherwise

2476.64 --> 2482.72
people will start to abuse it my ability

2479.599 --> 2484.48
to not hold a grudge

2482.72 --> 2486.0789999999997
sounds really weird and artistic

2484.48 --> 2488.88
probably

2486.079 --> 2488.88
maybe it is

2493.359 --> 2498.16
right but yeah the comment the thing

2496.48 --> 2501.359
about holding a grudges

2498.16 --> 2502.72
can be really problematic when the

2501.359 --> 2507.2799999999997
person

2502.72 --> 2511.7599999999998
that wronged the grudge for individual

2507.28 --> 2511.76
can't correct it can't

2511.92 --> 2517.28
like yeah set things right for the one

2515.04 --> 2520.0
that has the grudge then comes the

2517.28 --> 2524.3190000000004
really big problem

2520.0 --> 2527.359
right then it becomes problematic

2524.319 --> 2529.44
so i have i might be having a grudge i'm

2527.359 --> 2532.72
very forgiving though

2529.44 --> 2533.92
but it requires the action the action of

2532.72 --> 2538.3999999999996
recognition

2533.92 --> 2540.7200000000003
usually proper recognition is enough

2538.4 --> 2545.119
and then the grudge can be let go but i

2540.72 --> 2545.1189999999997
have to hold a grudge because if i don't

2546.72 --> 2553.2799999999997
the way i start to act in my

2550.079 --> 2556.88
social conduct will be

2553.28 --> 2557.76
discontorted and ineffective people will

2556.88 --> 2562.0
start to

2557.76 --> 2564.0
not respect me if i don't hold grudges

2562.0 --> 2566.48
i feel really weird for saying this

2564.0 --> 2566.48
right so

2567.28 --> 2571.3590000000004
but it is technically correct i think

2577.52 --> 2582.88
right agm that's right but that's

2580.88 --> 2584.96
but that's another that's another thing

2582.88 --> 2588.56
right

2584.96 --> 2592.48
a grudge for me is like you have to

2588.56 --> 2594.96
remember you can't just

2592.48 --> 2596.4
forget somebody's bad behavior and let

2594.96 --> 2598.7200000000003
it slip

2596.4 --> 2600.319
from your long-term conscious from your

2598.72 --> 2602.56
memory

2600.319 --> 2604.48
but hey if things get heated and we get

2602.56 --> 2607.52
very yelly and

2604.48 --> 2608.0
you like accuse me of ridiculous things

2607.52 --> 2610.48
and i

2608.0 --> 2612.16
get like really devilishly like

2610.48 --> 2614.48
basically start to project you

2612.16 --> 2616.56
in hell with my judgment yeah then

2614.48 --> 2621.44
afterward we both know like okay

2616.56 --> 2623.2
that was crazy too much energy

2621.44 --> 2624.64
and then there's no reason to hold a

2623.2 --> 2627.2
grudge

2624.64 --> 2627.2
over that

2628.079 --> 2631.8390000000004
but we do both recognize then that okay

2630.8 --> 2635.28
that happens

2631.839 --> 2638.4
and that has happened

2635.28 --> 2640.3190000000004
right and then we correct it so then the

2638.4 --> 2642.7200000000003
grudge has been addressed and

2640.319 --> 2645.2
can be forgiven and that part is very

2642.72 --> 2645.2
important

2645.359 --> 2651.04
but in my opinion you can't just forgive

2648.48 --> 2651.04
somebody

2652.56 --> 2662.16
to escape the social interaction

2657.04 --> 2666.8
of confrontation

2662.16 --> 2666.7999999999997
because then yeah it becomes

2674.839 --> 2679.04
disconnected

2676.319 --> 2679.04
yeah that's right

2680.079 --> 2682.6400000000003
hey gm

2686.4 --> 2689.599
right yes return to normal yes that's

2688.56 --> 2692.72
right nathan does

2689.599 --> 2694.96
respect me like freaking hell he

2692.72 --> 2696.7999999999997
he gives me recognition one of the few

2694.96 --> 2698.8
people out there that actually gives me

2696.8 --> 2702.1600000000003
recognition for my

2698.8 --> 2704.2400000000002
intellectual contributions

2702.16 --> 2706.72
and i'm like really honored and

2704.24 --> 2709.04
appreciative of that

2706.72 --> 2710.24
it's just that yesterday that didn't

2709.04 --> 2714.16
seem enough for me

2710.24 --> 2719.839
it was like no damn it the whole world

2714.16 --> 2719.839
i won recognition damn it yes

2725.359 --> 2729.92
but he does definitely respect me it's

2727.28 --> 2731.6800000000003
just he has his own moods and sometimes

2729.92 --> 2734.4
i guess that

2731.68 --> 2737.44
an arwyn just is this thing that you

2734.4 --> 2737.44
just kind of want to like

2738.0 --> 2740.96
poke or something

2742.079 --> 2745.52
i get that i've had a lot of good

2744.48 --> 2748.48
friends that

2745.52 --> 2748.96
had that it's like and they just are

2748.48 --> 2751.599
like

2748.96 --> 2752.2400000000002
are when you're just radiating this

2751.599 --> 2756.319
weird

2752.24 --> 2758.3999999999996
nervous our wind thing

2756.319 --> 2759.68
and we just have to slap you in that

2758.4 --> 2764.1600000000003
moment i'm like

2759.68 --> 2764.16
what oh okay

2764.72 --> 2769.04
not particularly happy with that but

2767.119 --> 2772.48
okay i guess that's

2769.04 --> 2774.079
how that works so and i think that

2772.48 --> 2778.48
nathan has a little

2774.079 --> 2778.48
bit of that tendency as well

2787.359 --> 2796.7999999999997
he has a negative and angry spirit

2791.2 --> 2796.7999999999997
what who are you talking about x320

2800.72 --> 2803.839
are you talked to agm

2819.76 --> 2826.3190000000004
tough love right well

2823.599 --> 2826.319
nathan and

2828.079 --> 2831.44
the british folk of the crew basically

2830.96 --> 2833.04
they say

2831.44 --> 2834.88
that's just a british thing we could

2833.04 --> 2838.96
just get tough on you it's like

2834.88 --> 2838.96
okay if that's what you want to call

2839.52 --> 2845.119
it's also in a way a dutch thing

2843.28 --> 2846.8
i think that's just the thing that they

2845.119 --> 2851.52
want to do and they just

2846.8 --> 2851.52
say okay it's a british thing fine

2852.559 --> 2857.3590000000004
right nathan you really think he's

2854.8 --> 2859.8390000000004
negative in an angry spirit

2857.359 --> 2859.839
why

2865.28 --> 2868.559
i don't really see that

2870.8 --> 2875.2000000000003
i think he's overall very neutral

2872.96 --> 2878.0
actually

2875.2 --> 2879.04
he just has a pretty wide spectrum of

2878.0 --> 2882.72
response

2879.04 --> 2886.0
that he can give i don't see him as like

2882.72 --> 2890.7999999999997
angry he just gets annoyed

2886.0 --> 2890.8
at times doesn't really get angry

2897.839 --> 2902.64
okay so what is your evidence for that

2899.92 --> 2905.119
x320 that i find that very odd that you

2902.64 --> 2905.1189999999997
say that

2906.88 --> 2915.839
how does he drag me down

2917.04 --> 2929.839
how tell me

2930.24 --> 2934.24
he literally gives me credit

2934.319 --> 2939.2799999999997
for my contributions my intellectual

2937.52 --> 2942.8
contributions he even

2939.28 --> 2946.0
utilizes my terminology

2942.8 --> 2948.4
as a standard staple like he honors me

2946.0 --> 2951.599
i don't i don't get what you're saying

2948.4 --> 2955.119
like how is he dragging me down

2951.599 --> 2958.48
by actually appreciating what i do

2955.119 --> 2960.7200000000003
i really don't get it x320 i really

2958.48 --> 2960.72
don't

2961.44 --> 2968.559
like i don't feel resentful on going

2964.64 --> 2971.359
on his show at all i'm not like oh my

2968.559 --> 2973.599
god not again

2971.359 --> 2975.2799999999997
sometimes i get a little like it but

2973.599 --> 2976.559
that's rather because i just don't want

2975.28 --> 2978.96
to talk about like

2976.559 --> 2980.88
flat earth versus ball mechanics for a

2978.96 --> 2983.119
moment right has nothing to do with oh

2980.88 --> 2985.52
it's nathan oakley again

2983.119 --> 2989.28
not not at all i don't understand where

2985.52 --> 2989.28
this is coming from x320

2994.079 --> 2997.76
yeah that's right agm he does make odd

2996.24 --> 3001.04
joke but and not just

2997.76 --> 3001.44
exclusively at me he gets a little wacky

3001.04 --> 3004.64
with

3001.44 --> 3004.64
everybody at times

3011.839 --> 3015.2799999999997
that's right dusty writer that's how i

3013.52 --> 3018.24
feel about it too he's basically

3015.28 --> 3021.6800000000003
attaining the alpha role

3018.24 --> 3027.839
and you have to like poke people to stay

3021.68 --> 3027.839
alpha or something

3030.72 --> 3034.58
[Music]

3038.839 --> 3041.839
hmm

3055.52 --> 3058.8
i didn't touch later

3060.96 --> 3069.2
well agm i don't know you know x320

3065.359 --> 3071.92
in chat says that how many people

3069.2 --> 3075.9199999999996
really think that how many people really

3071.92 --> 3078.48
think that nathan oakley dragged me down

3075.92 --> 3078.48
for real

3079.28 --> 3084.88
i mean we've had moments where i did

3083.04 --> 3087.599
i'm talking about like a year ago where

3084.88 --> 3090.7200000000003
i i felt like okay

3087.599 --> 3093.119
he's being too pushy and i did get

3090.72 --> 3094.48
miserable over it and then i would break

3093.119 --> 3098.1600000000003
open a can

3094.48 --> 3100.4
of outrage and be like hey this is

3098.16 --> 3101.5989999999997
this is terrible i'm i'm pissed off if

3100.4 --> 3104.96
you continue this i

3101.599 --> 3108.0
am going to get like troll on a level

3104.96 --> 3110.88
that nobody wants

3108.0 --> 3113.52
right like i will basically blow up the

3110.88 --> 3116.1600000000003
entire place if you continue

3113.52 --> 3117.359
sabotage from the inside and you can't

3116.16 --> 3119.7599999999998
undo it

3117.359 --> 3120.5589999999997
because i've already have my roots here

3119.76 --> 3123.8390000000004
etc

3120.559 --> 3126.48
like i would get like at some point it's

3123.839 --> 3126.48
got to stop

3127.04 --> 3130.72
at some point i'm just not gonna

3131.44 --> 3137.28
sit by anymore and that's it

3134.48 --> 3138.4
and then there would be an afterward

3137.28 --> 3142.1600000000003
period

3138.4 --> 3145.2000000000003
of recovery and recognition

3142.16 --> 3148.48
so yeah we've had our

3145.2 --> 3151.5989999999997
rough times in the past but

3148.48 --> 3156.96
not recently at all

3151.599 --> 3156.96
no he's been actually very nice to me

3157.04 --> 3164.16
literally sends me money through paypal

3160.319 --> 3167.44
okay and not after me asking he just

3164.16 --> 3170.48
comes over and does that

3167.44 --> 3173.76
and he has been complimenting me

3170.48 --> 3174.319
a lot like even in the periods where i

3173.76 --> 3178.8
don't get

3174.319 --> 3178.8
whiny about it okay one more like

3178.839 --> 3195.839
yesterday

3180.0 --> 3195.839
i want more recognition yeah

3198.48 --> 3203.68
he gives me credit for what well how

3201.52 --> 3206.72
about

3203.68 --> 3208.96
physicality assumption bias or physical

3206.72 --> 3209.7599999999998
assumption bias as he quickly pronounces

3208.96 --> 3214.48
it

3209.76 --> 3214.48
yeah he uses that

3214.559 --> 3218.079
how about the the yeah

3219.359 --> 3226.16
the arwynian paradox

3222.72 --> 3227.9199999999996
he he named it the arwynian paradox i

3226.16 --> 3230.319
discovered it he named it

3227.92 --> 3231.92
kiwi almost tried to steal it from me

3230.319 --> 3237.839
tried to steal the credit but

3231.92 --> 3237.839
no nathan sided with me dude

3259.68 --> 3263.68
thanks jason brown by the way i

3261.28 --> 3265.76
appreciate that

3263.68 --> 3267.7599999999998
and yeah maybe i will start to ignore

3265.76 --> 3270.559
x32 i just don't understand where this

3267.76 --> 3270.559
is coming from

3270.88 --> 3275.2000000000003
like the guy is very interested i think

3273.52 --> 3280.4
it's a guy

3275.2 --> 3280.3999999999996
in me eating on camera for some reason

3280.799 --> 3288.24
but now he basically refuses to

3285.119 --> 3289.44
relinquish that nathan might not be all

3288.24 --> 3291.9199999999996
that bad to me

3289.44 --> 3293.359
after i've given actual in detail

3291.92 --> 3307.839
examples as to

3293.359 --> 3307.839
how and why

3316.16 --> 3322.799
okay x320

3320.799 --> 3324.16
i just don't see the whole nathan thing

3322.799 --> 3325.92
because

3324.16 --> 3328.0
you know what that gives me the feeling

3325.92 --> 3328.0
of

3328.799 --> 3331.599
ranty

3332.839 --> 3341.2
jose and a lot of sock trolls

3337.599 --> 3341.92
that have been obsessedly obsessedly for

3341.2 --> 3345.7599999999998
that and they don't

3341.92 --> 3350.4
obsess over it now obsessively try to

3345.76 --> 3353.6800000000003
get me out of nathan's show

3350.4 --> 3355.92
they like for weeks on end

3353.68 --> 3358.16
they would be like oh you gotta get out

3355.92 --> 3361.2000000000003
here it's terrible it's like

3358.16 --> 3362.16
basically saying we won't stop haunting

3361.2 --> 3365.9199999999996
you

3362.16 --> 3367.1189999999997
until you stop participating with nathan

3365.92 --> 3370.559
and officially

3367.119 --> 3374.0
boycott him and tell him he's evil right

3370.559 --> 3374.799
they wouldn't stop haunting me in my

3374.0 --> 3377.92
chat

3374.799 --> 3379.28
and in comment sections like all comment

3377.92 --> 3383.359
section it was bad

3379.28 --> 3385.28
at the time right so it gives me a

3383.359 --> 3389.2799999999997
little bit of a feeling of that

3385.28 --> 3392.4
again for some reason people

3389.28 --> 3396.079
really want to just like cut

3392.4 --> 3399.44
me off nathan stop

3396.079 --> 3401.799
me from being part of that for some

3399.44 --> 3404.7200000000003
reason this seems to have some kind of a

3401.799 --> 3405.359
catastrophic influence for a whole bunch

3404.72 --> 3410.16
of people

3405.359 --> 3412.0789999999997
i don't get it gammas absolutely gammas

3410.16 --> 3414.16
but for the gammas it doesn't even

3412.079 --> 3416.8390000000004
really matter because whether nathan is

3414.16 --> 3418.64
separated from me and i'm separated from

3416.839 --> 3421.88
him we'll both

3418.64 --> 3424.8799999999997
still just as effectively

3421.88 --> 3428.319
absolutely crush

3424.88 --> 3432.079
and skin and just mangle

3428.319 --> 3435.599
every single one of them forever

3432.079 --> 3438.2400000000002
like we don't need to be like a team

3435.599 --> 3439.6800000000003
or partnered up in some way in order to

3438.24 --> 3442.72
achieve that level

3439.68 --> 3445.1189999999997
we can do that separately just fine so

3442.72 --> 3446.64
it's more than just the gamma seeing as

3445.119 --> 3450.0
it combined as a threat

3446.64 --> 3450.0
that it can't be that

3459.04 --> 3464.4
okay x320 i'm just referring to some

3461.92 --> 3464.4
history

3470.72 --> 3475.839
hey neil cosentino by the way good good

3472.96 --> 3475.839
to see you

3498.799 --> 3503.44
yeah extremely i think he was joking a

3500.88 --> 3504.799
little agm gets a little weird with

3503.44 --> 3509.76
words sometimes

3504.799 --> 3509.7599999999998
yeah see that's what i thought

3513.76 --> 3520.96
agm is a bit of a word juggler sometimes

3517.839 --> 3525.2799999999997
can seem a little cryptic

3520.96 --> 3525.28
but it's some kind of a

3525.92 --> 3531.839
british thing sort of

3552.4 --> 3556.1600000000003
right but you know what we can reflect a

3555.119 --> 3558.7200000000003
little on that

3556.16 --> 3560.96
like community history i just think it's

3558.72 --> 3564.24
really kind of special

3560.96 --> 3567.92
like where ranty

3564.24 --> 3570.9599999999996
is currently at what he's doing

3567.92 --> 3571.28
like what type of people he's engaging

3570.96 --> 3575.68
with

3571.28 --> 3578.96
right now compared to when he first

3575.68 --> 3582.0789999999997
got into the like the flat earth debates

3578.96 --> 3584.839
and what he was doing back then like

3582.079 --> 3587.8390000000004
yeah that now there's a guy that that's

3584.839 --> 3587.839
really

3589.68 --> 3594.0789999999997
he's kind of a hands-on guy so he he

3592.64 --> 3596.4
does

3594.079 --> 3598.0
he makes effort to do things to build

3596.4 --> 3602.1600000000003
things

3598.0 --> 3602.16
right that's like one of his good sides

3603.359 --> 3606.5589999999997
and yeah he goes out and he did that a

3606.0 --> 3611.359
lot he

3606.559 --> 3614.2400000000002
even got spent money to get out there

3611.359 --> 3614.5589999999997
and make a lot of interesting footage it

3614.24 --> 3617.7599999999998
got

3614.559 --> 3618.7200000000003
almost like this race going on the flat

3617.76 --> 3620.96
earth debates

3618.72 --> 3621.9199999999996
as we race for footage and the ballers

3620.96 --> 3625.2
also

3621.92 --> 3626.079
started to do that there was a race for

3625.2 --> 3628.64
it

3626.079 --> 3630.2400000000002
and ranty really tried to be like on the

3628.64 --> 3633.92
tip of the spear of that

3630.24 --> 3638.9599999999996
race to get footage of the horizon

3633.92 --> 3638.96
and film mirage effects etc etc

3640.0 --> 3643.839
but he was also acting like a dick

3646.079 --> 3653.04
especially against me yeah

3649.68 --> 3656.3999999999996
like you can ask the others

3653.04 --> 3659.68
they remember yes he did

3656.4 --> 3662.96
like he actually even like started

3659.68 --> 3662.96
sniping me and [ __ ]

3664.799 --> 3673.839
started sabotaging what i tried to do

3671.2 --> 3676.24
right and he was still supposedly a flat

3673.839 --> 3679.839
earther back i just find it very ironic

3676.24 --> 3679.839
to see where we both ended up

3680.799 --> 3685.839
like who got out of this better

3690.4 --> 3693.52
i mean i'm still here i'm doing my own

3692.96 --> 3697.28
show

3693.52 --> 3700.079
every day i have a loyal following

3697.28 --> 3701.599
i i do really have to be fair that i do

3700.079 --> 3705.28
get some recognition that

3701.599 --> 3706.559
locally i do right in the direct network

3705.28 --> 3710.1600000000003
yes i do i

3706.559 --> 3712.88
i should like stop being

3710.16 --> 3714.72
whiny about it and imagine like i could

3712.88 --> 3717.599
ever get some wilder fame

3714.72 --> 3719.359
which is really ridiculous and just

3717.599 --> 3720.96
realize that i actually do get

3719.359 --> 3723.7599999999998
recognition

3720.96 --> 3726.079
it's just not how much i in my

3723.76 --> 3729.2000000000003
imagination would like it to be

3726.079 --> 3733.92
but that may simply never

3729.2 --> 3736.72
fit in with actual reality

3733.92 --> 3738.64
and my ego doesn't like that sometimes

3736.72 --> 3742.0789999999997
right

3738.64 --> 3745.7599999999998
but i'm in a much better position here

3742.079 --> 3747.6800000000003
i'm a cosmogenist i'm an asset terrorist

3745.76 --> 3749.119
i'm focusing on language and

3747.68 --> 3752.16
understanding and

3749.119 --> 3755.52
really thought building and like

3752.16 --> 3758.16
how how to get a grip on on your

3755.52 --> 3761.7599999999998
consciousness dynamics

3758.16 --> 3763.68
within processes unfolding

3761.76 --> 3766.079
like what is it like what is the

3763.68 --> 3768.0
sensation like like

3766.079 --> 3770.96
where is the room for thinking and

3768.0 --> 3773.76
creativity within the moment etc etc

3770.96 --> 3775.2
look just heavy spirit dynamics

3773.76 --> 3777.5200000000004
esoterics

3775.2 --> 3778.72
and it's real i actually talk with

3777.52 --> 3780.559
consistency i'm

3778.72 --> 3782.0
actually building something i'm not just

3780.559 --> 3784.96
trying to be oh

3782.0 --> 3786.16
look something spooky something spirity

3784.96 --> 3789.44
oh that

3786.16 --> 3793.7599999999998
are you looking at the dangling keys

3789.44 --> 3798.96
right no i actually have a consistency

3793.76 --> 3798.96
and structure within what i talk about

3799.52 --> 3802.799
and i'm building it's getting better

3801.52 --> 3805.0389999999998
right

3802.799 --> 3807.0389999999998
and i'm still yeah with flat earth

3805.039 --> 3809.8390000000004
debates which has gotten

3807.039 --> 3811.599
quite a lot of attention nathan didn't

3809.839 --> 3812.5589999999997
get a lot of attention and he put so

3811.599 --> 3816.96
much work

3812.559 --> 3820.48
in his show he does he spends hours

3816.96 --> 3823.68
when he's not online on

3820.48 --> 3826.72
just making icons doing

3823.68 --> 3829.359
video updating just he

3826.72 --> 3832.64
puts hours work in it every day he's

3829.359 --> 3839.68
really putting in effort

3832.64 --> 3841.92
so he deserves all that credit

3839.68 --> 3844.72
now look at where's randy's at he's

3841.92 --> 3847.359
hanging around with conspiracy cats

3844.72 --> 3850.24
and a bunch of anti-flat earther

3847.359 --> 3850.24
degenerates

3851.839 --> 3858.799
doing like ghost spooky ghost shows like

3856.24 --> 3860.319
which are really is that a better

3858.799 --> 3863.52
position to be at

3860.319 --> 3864.16
than a flat earther to be a spooky ghost

3863.52 --> 3866.559
guy that

3864.16 --> 3867.2799999999997
is even in the mainstream line of

3866.559 --> 3872.96
thinking

3867.28 --> 3872.96
scoffed at so who's in a better position

3876.96 --> 3881.839
for real

3882.24 --> 3885.5989999999997
hello gary wiebenga

3906.839 --> 3909.839
ugh

3922.64 --> 3927.0389999999998
you think none what none

3927.92 --> 3932.88
okay is anybody following and what i'm

3929.839 --> 3932.88
actually talking about

3934.839 --> 3951.839
whatever

3936.24 --> 3951.839
i'll be back in two minutes

3962.839 --> 3965.839
now

4032.839 --> 4035.839
oh

4048.24 --> 4052.3999999999996
being happy in life no matter what you

4050.16 --> 4054.64
believe in should be the goal

4052.4 --> 4054.64
what

4060.4 --> 4077.839
how should that be the goal

4064.0 --> 4077.839
isn't that the reward

4095.68 --> 4100.3189999999995
but yeah technically i guess you're

4097.92 --> 4100.319
correct

4101.44 --> 4106.5599999999995
because you're gonna believe things

4103.6 --> 4108.2390000000005
right whether you realize it or not

4106.56 --> 4110.400000000001
you're always going to be believing

4108.239 --> 4112.639999999999
things in your life

4110.4 --> 4114.799
so it shouldn't matter really what you

4112.64 --> 4118.799
believe

4114.799 --> 4121.759
always make sure that the reality

4118.799 --> 4124.319
and the actions and the results will be

4121.759 --> 4128.56
consistent

4124.319 --> 4131.679
and that you'll have your needs

4128.56 --> 4133.359
fulfilled in order to well achieve this

4131.679 --> 4135.6
happiness as a reward

4133.359 --> 4135.6
right

4140.0 --> 4143.839
so yeah i agree anyway

4144.839 --> 4147.839
uh

4172.839 --> 4175.839
so

4228.84 --> 4231.84
wait

4253.04 --> 4260.56
okay well x320 well that's

4256.08 --> 4262.8
really nice that you can afford yourself

4260.56 --> 4262.8
that

4262.96 --> 4269.28
range of contacting yeah

4266.64 --> 4269.280000000001
i can't

4270.08 --> 4274.96
because i am building on something like

4272.8 --> 4279.1990000000005
literally inside of me

4274.96 --> 4283.28
with yeah virtually not literally

4279.199 --> 4286.48
with ideas thoughts feelings principles

4283.28 --> 4287.04
and i just can't afford to deal with

4286.48 --> 4290.159
people

4287.04 --> 4294.48
that can't deal

4290.159 --> 4294.48
with certain choices that i made

4294.64 --> 4298.08
i don't want to deal with it

4298.96 --> 4302.8
and if i want to move into the future

4301.92 --> 4305.92
with somebody

4302.8 --> 4307.52
they will have to grow with me

4305.92 --> 4309.12
and if they can't deal with certain

4307.52 --> 4312.719
elements of what i

4309.12 --> 4313.76
do and think then they won't be able to

4312.719 --> 4329.84
grow with me

4313.76 --> 4329.84
it's that simple

4333.12 --> 4336.64
would nathan be your my friend if i

4335.199 --> 4343.839999999999
believed in globe earth

4336.64 --> 4343.84
no no i wouldn't

4350.08 --> 4356.239
but he is though and i am not

4353.199 --> 4359.44
a believer in globe earth so

4356.239 --> 4363.04
oh hey

4359.44 --> 4365.599999999999
if your father was a cacti would you be

4363.04 --> 4366.48
as socially equipped to communicate with

4365.6 --> 4370.4800000000005
me in chat

4366.48 --> 4374.08
as you are now no

4370.48 --> 4377.36
well in that case

4374.08 --> 4379.6
you know you have an issue then

4377.36 --> 4381.12
because if your father was a cactus you

4379.6 --> 4384.08
would be less socially

4381.12 --> 4385.199
capable of communicating now wouldn't

4384.08 --> 4388.32
you

4385.199 --> 4399.839999999999
right that what kind of a point is a

4388.32 --> 4399.84
question like that

4400.239 --> 4413.839999999999
do you understand what i'm saying x320

4418.04 --> 4421.699
[Music]

4438.84 --> 4441.84
do

4462.4 --> 4469.28
so x320 i just gave you a full rebuttal

4466.4 --> 4470.639999999999
a scenario for you to imagine and

4469.28 --> 4473.679
compare with what

4470.64 --> 4477.12
you just said in chat

4473.679 --> 4477.12
i'd like a response to that

4479.04 --> 4483.84
like i don't really tolerate people to

4481.199 --> 4485.36
just blabber their dissatisfaction on a

4483.84 --> 4488.56
social level

4485.36 --> 4489.599999999999
and done not actually deal with it when

4488.56 --> 4497.84
the show host

4489.6 --> 4497.84
me starts to address it

4498.56 --> 4505.679
yeah that's not addressing it look dude

4502.719 --> 4508.2390000000005
i'm sorry you don't like nathan it's not

4505.679 --> 4511.84
my [ __ ] problem

4508.239 --> 4515.04
i will never be convinced to stop

4511.84 --> 4517.679
doing what i do in relation with him and

4515.04 --> 4517.679
his shows

4517.92 --> 4527.28
there's no way right

4524.88 --> 4528.400000000001
and if for some reason the behavior gets

4527.28 --> 4532.239
worse

4528.4 --> 4534.879999999999
from his side then i will match mine

4532.239 --> 4534.879999999999
with his

4536.88 --> 4540.400000000001
and the other way around as well

4544.08 --> 4553.84
we have a language barrier do we

4565.679 --> 4570.4800000000005
talking about friends well i don't know

4567.36 --> 4572.88
what kind of friends you deal with

4570.48 --> 4574.0
but i'm very careful at picking my

4572.88 --> 4578.400000000001
friends

4574.0 --> 4583.28
yeah to me a friend is somebody

4578.4 --> 4583.28
you can rely on to be

4584.48 --> 4588.639999999999
persistent in their dynamics

4590.8 --> 4595.84
somebody you can trust

4599.28 --> 4601.5199999999995
what

4607.12 --> 4623.84
hey squirrel sniper

4648.84 --> 4651.84
um

4660.08 --> 4664.5599999999995
stop there's not really an argument

4662.08 --> 4667.5199999999995
again there's just

4664.56 --> 4670.2390000000005
an issue somebody has and he's

4667.52 --> 4670.2390000000005
deflecting

4671.199 --> 4677.28
and i yeah i'm kind of calm right now i

4674.08 --> 4679.679
don't particularly have any other

4677.28 --> 4680.5599999999995
subject i need to talk about i mean i

4679.679 --> 4683.76
could bring up

4680.56 --> 4683.76
video that i did watch

4684.719 --> 4688.88
after having it recommended yesterday in

4687.84 --> 4692.56
my show

4688.88 --> 4698.64
in chat

4692.56 --> 4698.64
was it again a channel from australia

4701.36 --> 4708.96
yeah ewar that's the one

4707.199 --> 4711.04
i don't know who was the wreck was

4708.96 --> 4713.28
recommended to me in the chat

4711.04 --> 4714.48
and i did actually watch a full video of

4713.28 --> 4717.84
that

4714.48 --> 4721.5199999999995
and it was very interesting

4717.84 --> 4724.4800000000005
very antiquated

4721.52 --> 4727.040000000001
and a lot to do with alchemy and

4724.48 --> 4729.839999999999
esoterics of alchemy it was really

4727.04 --> 4734.88
fascinated and was very

4729.84 --> 4738.4800000000005
smoothly presented

4734.88 --> 4740.56
so yeah i did appreciate that video and

4738.48 --> 4743.28
having that channel recommended to me it

4740.56 --> 4746.64
is interesting

4743.28 --> 4749.04
i bet he puts a lot of time

4746.64 --> 4750.88
and effort into making those videos

4749.04 --> 4754.4
because it's really

4750.88 --> 4757.12
looks well sound quality as well

4754.4 --> 4757.12
good music

4761.04 --> 4765.199
at first i thought that the way he

4762.8 --> 4765.1990000000005
talked

4766.08 --> 4772.0
was a bit weird but then

4769.76 --> 4773.52
as the video all played out it was

4772.0 --> 4775.84
perfect

4773.52 --> 4778.719
but at first it's like what why is he

4775.84 --> 4781.1990000000005
talking so weird like that

4778.719 --> 4783.36
but then as the video progressed it was

4781.199 --> 4784.96
really fluid

4783.36 --> 4787.12
it actually kind of helped that it

4784.96 --> 4789.12
weighs it was a little slow

4787.12 --> 4791.92
because there was a lot of information

4789.12 --> 4794.96
to be related and if it was all rapid

4791.92 --> 4805.84
it might be more difficult to uptake so

4794.96 --> 4805.84
yeah i thought it was really good videos

4816.84 --> 4819.84
um

4820.88 --> 4825.12
right return to normal it was you that

4823.52 --> 4828.96
recommended this channel

4825.12 --> 4828.96
i appreciate that and yes

4829.6 --> 4833.4400000000005
not everything was perfect but it was

4832.56 --> 4835.4400000000005
all

4833.44 --> 4838.0
noteworthy and interesting you know

4835.44 --> 4841.44
there's in antiquitech

4838.0 --> 4844.88
there's been a lot of wild wild

4841.44 --> 4846.96
wild ideas that were all over the place

4844.88 --> 4848.400000000001
i thought that the ideas that he brought

4846.96 --> 4851.12
forth

4848.4 --> 4851.599999999999
were kind of basic and sensible like

4851.12 --> 4853.84
that

4851.6 --> 4853.84
like

4854.719 --> 4859.44
yeah there was a lot of interesting

4858.08 --> 4863.12
details and

4859.44 --> 4865.759999999999
like like eventually like it was kind of

4863.12 --> 4867.92
guided by the theme of antiquitech

4865.76 --> 4870.2390000000005
and alchemy but eventually the

4867.92 --> 4873.28
preponderance of details that were

4870.239 --> 4876.799999999999
inserted into the video were like very

4873.28 --> 4880.239
vast so it was just a whole bunch of

4876.8 --> 4880.2390000000005
information to consider

4882.0 --> 4885.6
it was interesting it was actually worth

4884.48 --> 4889.44
watching

4885.6 --> 4892.96
right to the end through to the end

4889.44 --> 4892.96
so yeah thank you for that tip

4900.84 --> 4903.84
interesting

4904.159 --> 4907.5199999999995
i'll post a link to it

4907.92 --> 4911.1990000000005
to the video i watched

4913.12 --> 4919.679
it's his second series okay

4917.52 --> 4922.4800000000005
it gets better well i kind of watched

4919.679 --> 4922.4800000000005
the last one

4927.12 --> 4931.84
okay okay

4933.84 --> 4937.28
this hangout is for one in the top ten

4936.48 --> 4945.839999999999
for you okay

4937.28 --> 4945.84
cool dutch sailor i appreciate that

4950.719 --> 4955.36
anyway yeah funnily enough you could say

4953.12 --> 4959.599999999999
that

4955.36 --> 4962.48
watching this video

4959.6 --> 4963.6
it kind of also helped me get out of my

4962.48 --> 4966.32
rage when

4963.6 --> 4968.88
my dissatisfaction experience that i had

4966.32 --> 4970.88
during yesterday's show

4968.88 --> 4972.08
because it did linger afterward too and

4970.88 --> 4973.84
it was very worried

4972.08 --> 4977.28
about a lot of things like what did i

4973.84 --> 4979.92
just do did i do it right

4977.28 --> 4981.44
like oh my god what did i just do this

4979.92 --> 4984.0
better have some

4981.44 --> 4986.879999999999
good fractal purpose or i'm gonna feel

4984.0 --> 4989.12
very very pissed off for

4986.88 --> 4990.88
for the lack of consistency but yeah in

4989.12 --> 4992.96
reflection yeah there was a whole

4990.88 --> 4996.400000000001
fractal line thing happening

4992.96 --> 4999.44
as usual it's like i'm a wizard

4996.4 --> 5000.159
what i do is wizardly even when i don't

4999.44 --> 5003.759999999999
realize

5000.159 --> 5004.96
it like my subconscious has already

5003.76 --> 5008.159000000001
arranged it to be

5004.96 --> 5010.56
like this whether my conscience is gonna

5008.159 --> 5012.239
work with it or against it it's going to

5010.56 --> 5016.159000000001
work out no matter what

5012.239 --> 5016.159
it's like i can't escape this fate

5022.4 --> 5027.599999999999
you're a wizard harry no i'm not a harry

5025.36 --> 5027.599999999999
though

5027.679 --> 5043.84
you can just call me arwen

5044.56 --> 5050.639
ah yes your unit of power oh i like that

5048.8 --> 5053.12
that's good i i thought that actually

5050.639 --> 5056.32
when you said it

5053.12 --> 5058.719
felt like oh is that two t's a misspell

5056.32 --> 5058.719
was it

5066.239 --> 5071.839999999999
right anyway

5082.84 --> 5085.84
time

5103.12 --> 5113.84
all right

5121.12 --> 5127.84
right so uh

5148.8 --> 5155.84
now let's move on

5156.4 --> 5162.799999999999
right oh yeah oh benjamin had a new

5159.679 --> 5166.08
video but i was weird i

5162.8 --> 5168.56
tried to watch it yesterday evening

5166.08 --> 5170.08
but like it just wouldn't load in

5168.56 --> 5173.6
bitchute it just wouldn't

5170.08 --> 5175.76
load at all but this morning i tried

5173.6 --> 5178.96
again

5175.76 --> 5183.84
and it did load eventually so i just got

5178.96 --> 5183.84
to watch like 20 minutes and that's it

5184.08 --> 5188.96
it's a lot about westworld again

5186.159 --> 5188.96
comparing it

5193.04 --> 5196.56
oh yeah i had to be informed of course

5195.199 --> 5200.96
yesterday also through

5196.56 --> 5200.96
infowars that apparently

5201.28 --> 5205.599999999999
biden's butt got wiped

5205.84 --> 5209.1990000000005
they freaking put that [ __ ] on a loop

5208.639 --> 5212.8
and just

5209.199 --> 5215.36
ah okay we get it he said something

5212.8 --> 5218.56
really weird and silly

5215.36 --> 5221.12
or was it code of something was it like

5218.56 --> 5223.360000000001
a secret deal

5221.12 --> 5225.679
thingy you could conspiracy theorize

5223.36 --> 5231.73
about it

5225.679 --> 5234.84
it's just so silly owens panda video

5231.73 --> 5234.839999999999
[Music]

5238.96 --> 5243.84
all right yeah return to normal did you

5241.04 --> 5243.84
see my uh

5244.639 --> 5251.6
panda conspiracy theory

5248.4 --> 5253.92
entry of owen benjamin's

5251.6 --> 5255.76
he said he told people like make up the

5253.92 --> 5258.2390000000005
silliest conspiracy theories that

5255.76 --> 5261.280000000001
involves panda and what i do

5258.239 --> 5263.5199999999995
and i did i had an entry for that on a

5261.28 --> 5267.599999999999
show

5263.52 --> 5269.679
don't overcook i even put the link

5267.6 --> 5271.679
in the comment section so you could go

5269.679 --> 5274.719
directly to where i start talking about

5271.679 --> 5274.719
that did you see that

5275.92 --> 5281.84
i thought it was pretty funny

5290.719 --> 5295.84
i literally just said all that

5299.04 --> 5304.239
it's the warning do not overcook video

5306.84 --> 5309.84
959

5323.6 --> 5327.92
you would like to know where the

5324.8 --> 5327.92
pyramids came from

5332.88 --> 5339.6
yeah i think a lot of people would like

5337.04 --> 5339.6
to know that

5348.48 --> 5353.919999999999
documentaries didn't help

5351.6 --> 5353.92
well

5355.12 --> 5358.48
that depends on the documentary of

5356.96 --> 5361.28
course because if it's some kind of

5358.48 --> 5364.718999999999
mainstream

5361.28 --> 5365.36
history based documentary yeah it's

5364.719 --> 5368.4800000000005
going to be

5365.36 --> 5372.4
absolute horseshit that is like

5368.48 --> 5374.638999999999
cookie cutter repeated constantly

5372.4 --> 5376.48
like oh these details of these details

5374.639 --> 5378.0
of that details are so important when

5376.48 --> 5381.28
the entire premise is

5378.0 --> 5386.719
complete horseshit yeah

5381.28 --> 5386.719
that's how education works we know

5386.96 --> 5392.4
but if you just put it in a little

5389.199 --> 5395.5199999999995
rougher context then

5392.4 --> 5395.5199999999995
you could definitely

5396.239 --> 5402.959999999999
imagine with not too much difficulty

5399.679 --> 5406.0
or at least i could that the pyramids

5402.96 --> 5409.04
were constructed before the flood

5406.0 --> 5411.6
and that they had a function it's

5409.04 --> 5412.4
they are hydroelectric generators like

5411.6 --> 5416.88
probably

5412.4 --> 5416.879999999999
all the pieces are there it's like okay

5417.199 --> 5423.759999999999
an electro engineer right you don't need

5421.36 --> 5425.36
the plans of its assembly in

5423.76 --> 5427.1990000000005
construction you don't need an

5425.36 --> 5430.08
instruction manual for a piece of

5427.199 --> 5433.919999999999
electronics right

5430.08 --> 5435.76
you open it up take a look and you just

5433.92 --> 5437.6
recognize oh like oh that's that oh

5435.76 --> 5440.88
that's that that's that okay this

5437.6 --> 5442.639
is probably this device this is what

5440.88 --> 5444.0
it's meant to do because you know the

5442.639 --> 5446.88
parts

5444.0 --> 5448.48
as an electro and technical person right

5446.88 --> 5450.159000000001
i'm not one of them but i've seen

5448.48 --> 5452.08
people do that my brother used to be

5450.159 --> 5453.28
into it a lot a couple of other friends

5452.08 --> 5456.239
too

5453.28 --> 5457.36
soldering and just electrics and i was

5456.239 --> 5460.718999999999
never good at it but

5457.36 --> 5462.799999999999
i get how it works when you learn

5460.719 --> 5464.719
how things work then you just know what

5462.8 --> 5465.6
it does and you can open it up and then

5464.719 --> 5468.639
see

5465.6 --> 5471.4400000000005
this is this device it has to be because

5468.639 --> 5471.4400000000005
it has all this

5471.92 --> 5476.719
if you're any good you you will just

5475.12 --> 5477.84
figure out by seeing the parts well in

5476.719 --> 5480.88
the same way

5477.84 --> 5481.360000000001
when the pyramids are analyzed how it is

5480.88 --> 5485.36
built

5481.36 --> 5485.36
what type of rocks are where

5486.159 --> 5489.839999999999
and the channels underneath it you just

5488.88 --> 5493.36
know

5489.84 --> 5494.8
this is a functioning mechanism it has

5493.36 --> 5497.36
to be

5494.8 --> 5498.96
because there's no other reason to put

5497.36 --> 5503.199
it together like this

5498.96 --> 5506.88
unless it had a function

5503.199 --> 5509.36
right and my conclusion is it's a

5506.88 --> 5513.28
hydroelectric

5509.36 --> 5516.48
magnetic electrostatic field generator

5513.28 --> 5517.12
something that inserts energy generated

5516.48 --> 5520.959999999999
by

5517.12 --> 5524.48
running water and transformed by rock

5520.96 --> 5527.76
very specific types into

5524.48 --> 5531.28
electric high voltage

5527.76 --> 5535.04
fields that would literally radiate

5531.28 --> 5538.239
off the pyramid top of the capstone

5535.04 --> 5540.4
into the wider area and that

5538.239 --> 5542.638999999999
would be comparable to technology that

5540.4 --> 5546.0
we can simulate now with

5542.639 --> 5549.76
electronics even and it has a palpable

5546.0 --> 5554.32
influence a positive influence

5549.76 --> 5555.52
like a purging influence a toxic purging

5554.32 --> 5557.84
influence

5555.52 --> 5559.52
right so it's very likely the pyramids

5557.84 --> 5561.84
were energy

5559.52 --> 5561.84
feeders

5562.56 --> 5568.96
so you take that element just as is like

5566.639 --> 5570.719
pyramids have a function this is what it

5568.96 --> 5572.96
has to do

5570.719 --> 5574.96
and it must have been useful or they

5572.96 --> 5575.679
would have never built such a thing that

5574.96 --> 5578.8
would be

5575.679 --> 5580.2390000000005
insane nobody builds anything unless it

5578.8 --> 5583.6
has a purpose

5580.239 --> 5583.599999999999
otherwise it's insane

5584.88 --> 5588.639
nobody's going to build something as

5586.639 --> 5591.679
elaborate as that unless it has an

5588.639 --> 5592.08
actual physical in-world function and

5591.679 --> 5593.76
not

5592.08 --> 5596.239
not just a bunch of blabbering and

5593.76 --> 5596.2390000000005
stories

5596.4 --> 5603.5199999999995
right it's too solid it's too much work

5599.84 --> 5606.56
to just not function for anything

5603.52 --> 5608.96
so yeah it's gonna send out his

5606.56 --> 5611.1990000000005
electric field then you have the whole

5608.96 --> 5612.719
situation with giants and through

5611.199 --> 5615.04
biblical

5612.719 --> 5618.719
references there were giants there was a

5615.04 --> 5623.04
flood the flood destroyed the giants

5618.719 --> 5624.159
okay how would the flood destroy the

5623.04 --> 5627.6
giants

5624.159 --> 5630.638999999999
well the giants were really large

5627.6 --> 5631.679
and they survived of electrostatic

5630.639 --> 5634.719
energy

5631.679 --> 5636.719
from giant structures like pyramids so

5634.719 --> 5640.4
they didn't have to literally eat

5636.719 --> 5643.28
everyone and everything to survive

5640.4 --> 5645.28
because being very big makes it the

5643.28 --> 5648.32
bigger you become the harder it is to

5645.28 --> 5648.32
maintain yourself

5648.56 --> 5653.1990000000005
like the smallest creatures have the

5650.48 --> 5655.28
most efficient metabolism ever

5653.199 --> 5658.5599999999995
they need to eat the little the the

5655.28 --> 5662.159
smallest amount so by that

5658.56 --> 5664.639
design life based knowledge yeah really

5662.159 --> 5669.12
large freaking giants 20 meters and

5664.639 --> 5673.28
taller they will have metabolic issues

5669.12 --> 5676.0
so if they were around

5673.28 --> 5677.84
they were integrated into the atlantean

5676.0 --> 5679.199
society then there must have been a

5677.84 --> 5683.119000000001
maintenance system

5679.199 --> 5685.5199999999995
to allow them to do that

5683.119 --> 5686.639
without them becoming like this weird

5685.52 --> 5690.0
sacrifice

5686.639 --> 5693.1990000000005
pillars just to keep them alive right

5690.0 --> 5695.36
so my conclusion is there's only one way

5693.199 --> 5698.4
this all fits together

5695.36 --> 5701.92
the pyramids electrostatically

5698.4 --> 5704.08
fed the giants then the flood came

5701.92 --> 5704.96
it stopped the functioning of the

5704.08 --> 5706.639
pyramids

5704.96 --> 5708.4800000000005
because if it's covered by water it's

5706.639 --> 5709.52
not going to send out this electrostatic

5708.48 --> 5711.759999999999
energy

5709.52 --> 5714.400000000001
the giants which might have originally

5711.76 --> 5717.119000000001
been able to swim

5714.4 --> 5718.159
didn't get fed and then as they were

5717.119 --> 5721.28
floating around

5718.159 --> 5723.599999999999
they starve to death very quickly

5721.28 --> 5725.599999999999
then the flood goes down all the giants

5723.6 --> 5727.1990000000005
are dead humans remain because they

5725.6 --> 5728.08
don't starve themselves to death when

5727.199 --> 5730.799999999999
the pyramids don't

5728.08 --> 5733.5199999999995
function and they take over and that's

5730.8 --> 5738.0
how we got into the classical era

5733.52 --> 5738.0
right that's how i put it together

5741.119 --> 5745.839999999999
and i did that pretty early on i have a

5744.08 --> 5750.08
flatter talks

5745.84 --> 5752.88
show about this subject specifically

5750.08 --> 5754.96
history of the world series and and a

5752.88 --> 5757.52
couple of parts most of it still

5754.96 --> 5759.679
stands i mean there's some minor

5757.52 --> 5761.92
adjustments here and some things like i

5759.679 --> 5764.4800000000005
like did i really need to put that in

5761.92 --> 5767.36
there i'm not sure about that now

5764.48 --> 5768.239
but most of the structure still stands

5767.36 --> 5770.88
valid

5768.239 --> 5772.48
and can be expanded upon i'm very proud

5770.88 --> 5774.88
of having done that

5772.48 --> 5777.36
it really was a moment in time like i am

5774.88 --> 5779.679
going to put down this route now

5777.36 --> 5781.44
and it's going to be big for the very

5779.679 --> 5783.679
very very very long run

5781.44 --> 5784.799999999999
it's very serious this is not just me

5783.679 --> 5788.4
assembling some

5784.8 --> 5793.76
random story-like thing

5788.4 --> 5793.759999999999
this is serious and i am still serious

5797.84 --> 5803.52
so yeah definitely check that out my old

5801.119 --> 5813.44
flat earth talks

5803.52 --> 5815.52
history of the world series

5813.44 --> 5817.839999999999
right yeah rubbish it wasn't the

5815.52 --> 5821.360000000001
egyptians yeah the egyptians were

5817.84 --> 5827.84
classical era they were the humans that

5821.36 --> 5827.839999999999
moved in after the flood went down

5836.0 --> 5840.08
and they've very likely turned the

5838.96 --> 5843.52
pyramid thing

5840.08 --> 5846.5599999999995
into a mystery religion

5843.52 --> 5848.88
right they didn't want to like

5846.56 --> 5849.6
turn it on again and lure a bunch of

5848.88 --> 5851.28
giants

5849.6 --> 5853.4400000000005
because there would have been surviving

5851.28 --> 5855.92
giants and hey they seem to grow

5853.44 --> 5857.759999999999
bigger over time so if there were any

5855.92 --> 5859.52
surviving smaller giants

5857.76 --> 5862.639
and there was an active pyramid it was

5859.52 --> 5864.8
very likely they would be drawn to it

5862.639 --> 5866.96
and then the country would be invaded by

5864.8 --> 5870.320000000001
giants and now you lose the control of

5866.96 --> 5872.4
humans so they didn't turn it back on

5870.32 --> 5875.44
they kept it as it is and they turned it

5872.4 --> 5878.08
into a mystery religion

5875.44 --> 5878.96
and now it's all about the pharaoh oh

5878.08 --> 5881.199
gods in

5878.96 --> 5882.08
human form right they were all about oh

5881.199 --> 5885.599999999999
look at

5882.08 --> 5887.84
oh now the humans are the gods like

5885.6 --> 5889.04
don't think about the freaking giants

5887.84 --> 5892.159000000001
don't

5889.04 --> 5897.84
don't talk about gilgamesh

5892.159 --> 5897.839999999999
the giant wizard king who was brilliant

5899.76 --> 5903.52
you know no it's the humans are the gods

5902.08 --> 5906.0
now oh

5903.52 --> 5907.360000000001
right it was all about that post flood

5906.0 --> 5909.679
it was all about oh

5907.36 --> 5910.96
now humans are the special boys oh now

5909.679 --> 5913.84
we're finally

5910.96 --> 5915.76
not going to be lurked over by giants

5913.84 --> 5918.32
who are going to make us feel small now

5915.76 --> 5919.679
we can be the big

5918.32 --> 5923.28
[Music]

5919.679 --> 5925.6
yeah post flood is all about that

5923.28 --> 5927.199
it's where humans take over and become

5925.6 --> 5930.159000000001
the first thing they do

5927.199 --> 5931.759999999999
become delusional as [ __ ] and think

5930.159 --> 5933.44
themselves as gods

5931.76 --> 5936.08
yeah that's what happens that's what

5933.44 --> 5936.08
happens when

5936.96 --> 5944.0
large beings suddenly

5940.48 --> 5944.0
drop out of the picture

5945.36 --> 5949.28
right it's it you could compare it

5948.32 --> 5952.88
almost to

5949.28 --> 5955.119
just a family typical family

5952.88 --> 5956.400000000001
there's a kid in there kids becomes a

5955.119 --> 5958.5599999999995
teenager

5956.4 --> 5960.08
now they were the kid in the family and

5958.56 --> 5963.6
then there was a hierarchy

5960.08 --> 5966.8
and then at some point it's like i'm

5963.6 --> 5967.76
i'm my own man now i'm gonna go out of

5966.8 --> 5968.88
the house and

5967.76 --> 5971.679
guess what they're gonna do they're

5968.88 --> 5974.719
gonna act like idiots delusional

5971.679 --> 5977.36
over brave risk too much [ __ ]

5974.719 --> 5979.52
not get their act together well it was

5977.36 --> 5982.5599999999995
kind of like that

5979.52 --> 5985.679
the post flood situation and humans were

5982.56 --> 5988.4800000000005
that teenager that suddenly

5985.679 --> 5990.56
dropped out of the family never got back

5988.48 --> 5992.4
that family is lost the giants weren't

5990.56 --> 5995.679
there anymore like they were

5992.4 --> 5998.4
a lot of the old structure

5995.679 --> 6000.32
the structure of the atlantean society

5998.4 --> 6001.599999999999
was all gone right no more family

6000.32 --> 6003.759999999999
structure like that

6001.6 --> 6006.4800000000005
it's yeah that's actually a really good

6003.76 --> 6006.4800000000005
comparison

6007.199 --> 6010.879999999999
and the humans went completely

6008.719 --> 6014.719
delusional i thought like oh

6010.88 --> 6018.32
we're the gods now worship us

6014.719 --> 6018.32
because we have the god

6021.52 --> 6025.52
and that's how the mystery religion

6023.36 --> 6029.199
started basically the

6025.52 --> 6032.2390000000005
beginning of age of illusion

6029.199 --> 6032.638999999999
when people started to destroy evidence

6032.239 --> 6034.879999999999
to

6032.639 --> 6037.84
conjure forth the illusion for man to

6034.88 --> 6037.84
believe is reality

6039.04 --> 6042.719
it started with the great destruction

6041.679 --> 6046.4
the great flood

6042.719 --> 6048.32
that creation god

6046.4 --> 6051.839999999999
did in the first place after things have

6048.32 --> 6051.84
gone all out of control

6052.719 --> 6056.56
and then george started to take that

6054.8 --> 6060.400000000001
over it's like hey it's actually

6056.56 --> 6062.0
really handy when you erase everything

6060.4 --> 6064.719
because then you don't have any

6062.0 --> 6068.719
distractions from your priesthood

6064.719 --> 6071.04
stories you need people to believe right

6068.719 --> 6072.159
how many times has that effect repeated

6071.04 --> 6076.08
throughout history

6072.159 --> 6078.4
even on record smithsonian

6076.08 --> 6080.0
literally destroying giant bones

6078.4 --> 6082.879999999999
throwing them in the ocean

6080.0 --> 6083.679
because it doesn't fit the narrative of

6082.88 --> 6093.84
evolution

6083.679 --> 6093.84
right been doing it ever since

6103.92 --> 6108.2390000000005
sumeria mythical era before the flood

6106.32 --> 6110.48
and babylon sure they were all

6108.239 --> 6113.759999999999
probably part of it i just call it

6110.48 --> 6121.839999999999
atlantis it's all atlantis

6113.76 --> 6121.84
it was all atlantis post flood

6131.52 --> 6135.4400000000005
ah looks like nathan is going to have a

6134.239 --> 6149.839999999999
live show today

6135.44 --> 6149.839999999999
good looking forward to that

6152.87 --> 6156.01
[Music]

6174.84 --> 6180.719
hmm i don't know though by the way

6177.76 --> 6180.719
agm about

6181.44 --> 6188.239
like or babylon and sumeria really

6188.88 --> 6191.84
pre-flood

6200.96 --> 6205.04
or were they actually post flood were

6203.04 --> 6209.44
they like an early attempt to

6205.04 --> 6212.159
quickly rebuild atlantis or something

6209.44 --> 6212.159
are you sure

6214.159 --> 6220.4
before the flood x320 before the flood

6217.679 --> 6222.56
before the flood the pyramids were built

6220.4 --> 6224.4
before the flood the pyramids were built

6222.56 --> 6227.1990000000005
before the flood

6224.4 --> 6228.719
like how is there confusion about this

6227.199 --> 6233.839999999999
it's blatantly obvious

6228.719 --> 6233.84
the pyramids were built before the flood

6234.32 --> 6238.08
and the flood changed the layout of the

6237.44 --> 6241.28
land

6238.08 --> 6243.199
it made the river go

6241.28 --> 6245.599999999999
in another place and that's why the

6243.199 --> 6261.839999999999
hydroelectric generator

6245.6 --> 6261.84
didn't work anymore

6262.639 --> 6270.159000000001
before the flood and we came back okay

6266.08 --> 6272.639
sumeria so they call it sumeria

6270.159 --> 6273.36
mythical era well atlanta i call that

6272.639 --> 6275.6
okay

6273.36 --> 6277.92
they call it sumeria i don't even know

6275.6 --> 6282.320000000001
where that's rooted from

6277.92 --> 6284.719
i call it atlantis to signify

6282.32 --> 6286.84
the technological applications and their

6284.719 --> 6290.4800000000005
building qualities and

6286.84 --> 6293.679
giants right to me

6290.48 --> 6298.48
atlantis is intricately and

6293.679 --> 6298.4800000000005
tang is intricately lockstep connected

6298.8 --> 6307.119000000001
vast megastructures like pyramids

6303.199 --> 6311.239
some yeah and heavy

6307.119 --> 6312.639
like technological applications in in a

6311.239 --> 6315.759999999999
non-electronics way

6312.639 --> 6318.0
just different technology with flight

6315.76 --> 6319.679
floating cities no doubt everything was

6318.0 --> 6323.76
probably there

6319.679 --> 6326.88
and giants and giant creatures

6323.76 --> 6326.88
like pets

6327.28 --> 6331.04
i bet they had giant reptiles that

6329.119 --> 6334.159
regular humans rode

6331.04 --> 6337.199
and giants and who knows what kind of

6334.159 --> 6337.199
beasts they had

6341.44 --> 6349.839999999999
plato gave us atlantis

6345.52 --> 6349.84
sure well he speculated about it

6350.4 --> 6353.28
and so do i

6356.639 --> 6361.119
but hey you can call it sumeria if you

6359.04 --> 6363.119
like i just think that atlanta spanned

6361.119 --> 6366.639
around the entire world it was

6363.119 --> 6369.679
a world culture

6366.639 --> 6369.92
it was a world empire or was it even an

6369.679 --> 6372.2390000000005
m

6369.92 --> 6373.6
was it even imperial i don't know i

6372.239 --> 6376.08
don't know what the setup was

6373.6 --> 6377.6
but it was it spanned around the entire

6376.08 --> 6380.8
world there are pyramids

6377.6 --> 6384.719
everywhere guys everywhere around

6380.8 --> 6384.719
where we've been everywhere there are

6384.84 --> 6387.84
pyramids

6388.159 --> 6391.839999999999
since we don't and can't build them

6390.48 --> 6394.239
anymore

6391.84 --> 6395.4400000000005
it must have all been built in the same

6394.239 --> 6399.04
period where they

6395.44 --> 6399.759999999999
weren't just technology so they had to

6399.04 --> 6402.08
build it

6399.76 --> 6404.0
like oh we have to build a power plant

6402.08 --> 6405.5199999999995
now it's like yo we have to build the

6404.0 --> 6408.8
pyramids now

6405.52 --> 6412.84
right that's it

6408.8 --> 6415.84
in the same era and i call that era

6412.84 --> 6415.84
atlantis

6428.719 --> 6431.76
what do you think about icarus flying

6430.639 --> 6435.119
too close to the sun

6431.76 --> 6438.8
is it a thing no it's not

6435.119 --> 6438.799999999999
it's a reification

6439.76 --> 6446.56
right the only value that idea has

6443.04 --> 6448.48
is in an esoteric metaphorical way

6446.56 --> 6449.679
because there is no distance to the sun

6448.48 --> 6452.0
you cannot

6449.679 --> 6453.1990000000005
get too close to the sun it's not a

6452.0 --> 6457.28
physical thing

6453.199 --> 6460.0
in euclidean space to approach

6457.28 --> 6460.8
but then again icarus is technically

6460.0 --> 6465.199
angelic

6460.8 --> 6468.88
right angelic celestial so

6465.199 --> 6472.4
is that like a star

6468.88 --> 6475.52
or something getting close to the moon

6472.4 --> 6478.08
is icarus a symbol for the moon

6475.52 --> 6479.4400000000005
that in the cycle gets too close to the

6478.08 --> 6481.92
sun and then disappears

6479.44 --> 6483.119
for three days is that icarus literally

6481.92 --> 6485.04
ah

6483.119 --> 6486.639
he's gone for three days oh wait he

6485.04 --> 6489.119
comes out again

6486.639 --> 6490.56
who knows what that story really is

6489.119 --> 6493.759999999999
about i just know

6490.56 --> 6495.92
there's no way in hell or heaven

6493.76 --> 6499.84
that it is physically literal in any

6495.92 --> 6499.84
sort of way

6503.28 --> 6508.4
right icarus could be the moon

6506.4 --> 6510.48
disappearing for three days because it

6508.4 --> 6513.92
gets too close to the sun

6510.48 --> 6516.879999999999
yeah it's not too difficult to

6513.92 --> 6516.88
see that connection

6519.199 --> 6523.599999999999
the sun disappears three days no it

6521.28 --> 6523.599999999999
doesn't

6523.76 --> 6527.84
it's the moon that disappears

6533.44 --> 6541.5199999999995
sun just doesn't change cycle it

6536.56 --> 6543.679
keeps steady in a specific route

6541.52 --> 6544.96
for three days it doesn't disappear

6543.679 --> 6555.84
that's ridiculous

6544.96 --> 6555.84
sun doesn't disappear for days

6607.679 --> 6625.84
i'll be back in two minutes and then i'm

6609.199 --> 6625.839999999999
rounding out the shoe

6678.84 --> 6681.84
so

6692.84 --> 6695.84
so

6699.119 --> 6702.239
yeah yeah it was a great hangout today

6701.76 --> 6705.4400000000005
i'm

6702.239 --> 6706.08
very happy about this one much calmer

6705.44 --> 6709.119
and i

6706.08 --> 6709.92
i i reflect it properly upon yesterday's

6709.119 --> 6713.92
show's

6709.92 --> 6717.36
show which was kind of necessary

6713.92 --> 6719.92
maybe most of you viewers really got it

6717.36 --> 6720.639
like from the multiple crystal angle at

6719.92 --> 6725.36
the time

6720.639 --> 6728.96
well surprise surprise in ways i didn't

6725.36 --> 6732.08
i executed it all i i did the show i did

6728.96 --> 6734.719
my thing but afterward

6732.08 --> 6736.0
other elements had to slip in so that it

6734.719 --> 6740.4
was something that maybe

6736.0 --> 6744.239
i needed to reflect upon more than most

6740.4 --> 6744.239
but i'm glad that i did

6744.719 --> 6751.84
and today has been a very interesting

6746.719 --> 6751.84
show as well with a lot of details

6753.119 --> 6760.719
psychology social interaction engagement

6756.88 --> 6762.2390000000005
platforming and a little bit about

6760.719 --> 6764.8
giants and pyramids

6762.239 --> 6779.839999999999
at the end so yeah i'm very happy with

6764.8 --> 6779.84
this show

6791.28 --> 6797.759999999999
well x320 that that's not necessarily

6794.48 --> 6797.759999999999
causation though but

6801.28 --> 6806.32
but hey you're just fine even though you

6804.08 --> 6807.84
don't really like me hanging around with

6806.32 --> 6809.84
