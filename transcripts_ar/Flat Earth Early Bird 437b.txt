5.299 --> 13.440000000000001
yes welcome back my internet got very

11.37 --> 15.98
serious interrupted that seriously

13.44 --> 21.14
interrupted and I didn't see it in time

15.98 --> 25.109
so I'm just starting a second part I

21.14 --> 31.519
hope you guys are seeing this double

25.109 --> 31.519000000000002
check actually yes

33.26 --> 36.26
double-check

37.359 --> 40.359
yes

44.3 --> 54.709999999999994
hold on yeah it's a it's I have to

48.95 --> 57.730000000000004
exchange the chat as well so they're

54.71 --> 57.730000000000004
with me for a second

77.61 --> 80.79
[Music]

86.189 --> 90.719
yeah sorry people I got some technical

88.89 --> 93.929
difficulties with my internet again

90.719 --> 95.49
didn't see it in time but I'm continuing

93.929 --> 108.53
the show even though I've got kind of

95.49 --> 108.53
off track here all right

108.97 --> 117.28
okay so we're back welcome back yielding

114.4 --> 119.4
yella klein michael roark seeking truth

117.28 --> 123.42
ESP power one one seven

119.4 --> 123.42
you're all [ __ ] okay

125.34 --> 146.62
they like Ohio Stacey be all right so

144.07 --> 155.10999999999999
what was that talking about yeah the the

146.62 --> 160.6
article that Adam forwarded to me that

155.11 --> 163.93
was originally forwarded by John yeah it

160.6 --> 166.81
was it sir doesn't seem to be anything

163.93 --> 174.91
particularly wrong with the article but

166.81 --> 179.62
yeah it's just a report basically let me

174.91 --> 181.07999999999998
see if I can present that again damn it

179.62 --> 186.239
I lost it

181.08 --> 186.239
no it's in the other chat this is just

186.42 --> 197.069
wow okay let's see yeah I'm gonna

190.84 --> 199.62
find it what Chad is the same what the

197.069 --> 210.56
okay great so I can get the link back

199.62 --> 210.56
whatever Oh God bring that up in here

212.15 --> 215.72
take you this stuff

218.18 --> 221.33
[Music]

224.8 --> 228.90900000000002
[Music]

231.209 --> 239.04
yeah the other Cline well I'd rather

234.519 --> 239.04
color the particle wave false dichotomy

258.5 --> 261.5
ha

268.53 --> 282.25
all right so anyway from the yeah the

278.2 --> 285.69
sources what I've seen yeah

282.25 --> 291.34
my conclusion is this suppose it

285.69 --> 294.45
diffraction pattern it's different it's

291.34 --> 294.45
not the same pattern

301.73 --> 309.95000000000005
and for me that's just kind of like yeah

304.73 --> 312.5
that just goes to show like maybe it the

309.95 --> 317.53
whole concept is kind of over

312.5 --> 322.91
generalizing what is actually happening

317.53 --> 326.46999999999997
with the diffraction effects I don't

322.91 --> 330.88000000000005
know but yeah anyway still kind of touch

326.47 --> 334.40000000000003
feeling around in the dark at this point

330.88 --> 338.17
and everybody seems to be really

334.4 --> 338.16999999999996
polarized in one way or the other

349.479 --> 357.37
yeah yell decline I know not really

353.319 --> 363.129
updated modern day but yeah it is what

357.37 --> 366.3
it is and for me the older article at

363.129 --> 373.36
least showed something that seemed like

366.3 --> 376.949
an actual display off of the output but

373.36 --> 379.36
the buckyballs that a little graph in it

376.949 --> 381.219
yeah and it's the first thing that I

379.36 --> 388.68
know is just like oh yeah it's a pattern

381.219 --> 388.68
oh it's not that pattern though

400.73 --> 410.23
so yeah but yet to all the all the light

406.04 --> 413.75
wavers out there that might mistake this

410.23 --> 416.99
genuine recognition of a situation on my

413.75 --> 419.3
part as some kind of oh yeah yeah oh god

416.99 --> 423.41
he's gonna go to our side it's gotta be

419.3 --> 425.75
a waiver waving either saying all about

423.41 --> 432.64000000000004
the ether all day fantasize about the

425.75 --> 436.75
ether new you know no I I think that

432.64 --> 440.57
conceptual ether is very pointless

436.75 --> 443.96
really but I do think there is something

440.57 --> 447.62
as electrical energy in the air and has

443.96 --> 453.08
also been named ether and I'm going with

447.62 --> 454.43
that that that is something that that

453.08 --> 459.91999999999996
could be something that there is

454.43 --> 462.77
something and now call it the ether but

459.92 --> 465.71000000000004
as for a medium for light to go through

462.77 --> 468.59
no that's just a conceptual creation

465.71 --> 475.01
based on a misunderstanding of what's

468.59 --> 478.35999999999996
really going on in my opinion and from

475.01 --> 478.36
what I've gathered from the data

481.159 --> 487.729
I don't know I guess that I think but

485.899 --> 490.249
this is pure wet finger work at this

487.729 --> 494.50899999999996
point it's very preliminary but I think

490.249 --> 496.96900000000005
that it's it's gotten there because

494.509 --> 501.019
people just have it when things get very

496.969 --> 503.74899999999997
tough and complex people kind of get

501.019 --> 506.959
compelled to jump to conclusions as

503.749 --> 511.69
quick as possible to kind of not be

506.959 --> 516.86
subjected to the complications anymore

511.69 --> 524.389
it's a very human tendency because it

516.86 --> 526.67
just causes pressure and if you let that

524.389 --> 528.769
pressure overcome you you become part of

526.67 --> 530.93
the polarized situation if you don't

528.769 --> 535.37
have ever then the polarized situation

530.93 --> 539.3889999999999
on either side will start to pick at you

535.37 --> 541.4590000000001
try to manipulate you and subconsciously

539.389 --> 547.49
to get to their side that's what it

541.459 --> 550.939
wants so the polarization does and I

547.49 --> 553.279
don't want to be part of that because I

550.939 --> 555.529
think that there is things to be

553.279 --> 559.389
discovered here it just you have to get

555.529 --> 559.389
through the complications

566.98 --> 577.39
all right well Alan health TLV Jian

573.06 --> 582.25
ovation particle wave duality nature of

577.39 --> 586.84
light what dual nature that that's the

582.25 --> 589.36
thing you call it a dual nature but if

586.84 --> 594.7900000000001
you really think about it that simply

589.36 --> 597.12
makes it neither simply means that the

594.79 --> 602.1999999999999
particle concept and the wave approach

597.12 --> 604.51
are have correlations but it doesn't

602.2 --> 612.6400000000001
really match so there's something else

604.51 --> 616.3
going on that's what I suspect that's

612.64 --> 618.6899999999999
what I've been trying to work with find

616.3 --> 622.1999999999999
a way through see what space is left

618.69 --> 622.2
people don't look

622.69 --> 625.8290000000001
[Music]

629.64 --> 633.11
[Music]

658.25 --> 660.97
hmm

661.02 --> 669.3
I'm wondering in a way like

669.92 --> 674.029
I know that this is just a pure

672.429 --> 678.709
conceptualization out of nothing

674.029 --> 682.54
basically but light can deviate the path

678.709 --> 687.529
of other light rights like you can

682.54 --> 689.48
basically cross beams and then yeah

687.529 --> 691.97
based on the intensity you can prepare

689.48 --> 695.029
the situation in such a way that I don't

691.97 --> 696.7090000000001
know the gas in that space where the

695.029 --> 698.809
light beams cross would reach a certain

696.709 --> 700.669
critical energy level because of the

698.809 --> 705.169
yeah the combined energy and then that

700.669 --> 707.809
would have an effect but literally the

705.169 --> 710.559
light itself does not deviate path of

707.809 --> 710.559
other light right

720.79 --> 729.79
it's at the gym anyway it's just I'm a

724.99 --> 731.8
bit bit messy today but I also again

729.79 --> 734.1999999999999
very distracted still by D and D it's

731.8 --> 742.3299999999999
like I don't really have the room now to

734.2 --> 744.9000000000001
get in really deep mmm too much other

742.33 --> 744.9000000000001
things on my mind

752.26 --> 754.86
what

771.5 --> 777.77
okay effector crude but what is your

773.87 --> 780.58
point I don't see why you need to get

777.77 --> 780.5799999999999
all swearing

790.31 --> 798.29
right Victor Cruz well I'm not ready to

795.529 --> 803.06
formulate any kind of hypothesis yet I'm

798.29 --> 805.2199999999999
still trying to figure out still

803.06 --> 807.79
gathering data basically this is so

805.22 --> 810.1
freakin complex like and

807.79 --> 813.379
misunderstandings are so easily made

810.1 --> 815.149
it's yeah I guess you could compare it

813.379 --> 817.519
in a way to biology when there's

815.149 --> 819.139
something new a new process or a

817.519 --> 822.7090000000001
creature with some kind of new organ

819.139 --> 825.47
that's just never been seen yeah what

822.709 --> 829.3389999999999
the you know misunderstandings are very

825.47 --> 832.149
easily made I guess it's very rough

829.339 --> 832.149
comparison but

854.59 --> 859.9300000000001
oh yeah what your decline when I was

858.22 --> 863.8000000000001
little I was watching cartoons a lot

859.93 --> 871.27
it's probably the reason I'm so good at

863.8 --> 874.0889999999999
English now although I'll be watching

871.27 --> 877.66
cartoons today they're all translated in

874.089 --> 880.7700000000001
Dutch it's completely useless it's not

877.66 --> 880.77
even good quality Dutch

895.19 --> 900.44
all right well Victor crude one of the

897.86 --> 907.04
things that I'm interested in testing

900.44 --> 908.7790000000001
out is how cascade the what I think is

907.04 --> 911.5
actually going on with that fraction how

908.779 --> 915.529
the Cascade effect actually works and

911.5 --> 920.949
what will happen if you for example put

915.529 --> 925.91
other obstacles in between the void

920.949 --> 929.3
parts of the dispersion what will happen

925.91 --> 932.87
I think that there may be some really

929.3 --> 935.81
weird [ __ ] in there that's just never

932.87 --> 938.0600000000001
been overlooked because people got stuck

935.81 --> 946.2199999999999
in the in the freaking wave particle

938.06 --> 948.92
duality [ __ ] I was just testing testing

946.22 --> 951.1990000000001
testing you know that's technically what

948.92 --> 953.779
Tesla did he just tested a lot he's not

951.199 --> 956.269
gonna hypothesize defendants I put now

953.779 --> 958.79
he would just be freakin fooling around

956.269 --> 960.41
and then afterward I had a huge amount

958.79 --> 966.17
of things that he did because he was

960.41 --> 970.029
always doing [ __ ] then he would create a

966.17 --> 973.939
theory based on everything that he's

970.029 --> 976.25
figured out and wouldn't necessarily all

973.939 --> 979.7199999999999
be correct but it would be a complete

976.25 --> 979.72
model based on his information

986.23 --> 997.41
oh yeah deck its in four days yeah right

994.96 --> 997.4100000000001
it's Thursday

1008.61 --> 1018.989
what the hell ellen:oh Italian what the

1015.119 --> 1023.089
duality well what but yeah what what is

1018.989 --> 1025.709
that what is the particle wave duality

1023.089 --> 1027.809
that it is both things at the same time

1025.709 --> 1031.169
that it's one thing one time one thing

1027.809 --> 1033.809
and another well how does that make

1031.169 --> 1035.189
sense in your mind how would you then

1033.809 --> 1037.649
conclude that there's two different

1035.189 --> 1039.1490000000001
things that are completely separate like

1037.649 --> 1039.87
one is an effect one is an actual

1039.149 --> 1042.389
substance

1039.87 --> 1043.9799999999998
how would you then just accept that it

1042.389 --> 1049.7099999999998
is both things at the same time that

1043.98 --> 1052.1100000000001
seems yeah a bigger leap in logic then

1049.71 --> 1059.22
then I would be willing to take at this

1052.11 --> 1064.26
point so could it not be considered to

1059.22 --> 1067.23
be something else maybe I don't know

1064.26 --> 1068.669
would it hurt for somebody like me to

1067.23 --> 1069.51
try and figure out if it could be

1068.669 --> 1073.519
something else

1069.51 --> 1076.47
it's be shameful all the 80 years of

1073.519 --> 1078.269
particle wave duality stands and and all

1076.47 --> 1080.58
the bickering that comes with it oh it

1078.269 --> 1083.61
is so important I should definitely not

1080.58 --> 1088.1589999999999
get in there well I don't know this this

1083.61 --> 1092.639
comment kind of now compels me even more

1088.159 --> 1095.0100000000002
because apparently it's covering up

1092.639 --> 1098.519
something something is being covered up

1095.01 --> 1103.309
not by the people doing in the covering

1098.519 --> 1106.139
up it's just it's been politicized so

1103.309 --> 1106.74
technically didn't yeah he let me get a

1106.139 --> 1110.039
little weird

1106.74 --> 1114.6490000000001
yeah demons are involved they've taken

1110.039 --> 1117.95
route polarization that's typically that

1114.649 --> 1124.7399999999998
comes the realm of of bickering and

1117.95 --> 1130.5
politicized opposition and yeah that

1124.74 --> 1132.389
will bring people towards me poking me

1130.5 --> 1136.2
and telling me you shouldn't do that or

1132.389 --> 1139.6689999999999
you should step on this side you know it

1136.2 --> 1139.669
sounds very familiar doesn't it

1140.39 --> 1144.65
it sounds very familiar to me

1153.75 --> 1165.69
a wavelet oh really a wavelet particle

1159.69 --> 1172.769
that's what yeah I heard you the first

1165.69 --> 1179.1490000000001
time but okay so a wavelet is not a

1172.769 --> 1179.1490000000001
weight or is it suggests a wavy thingy

1185.679 --> 1197.0590000000002
all right wavelet wave what is a wavelet

1190.58 --> 1201.6789999999999
is that like a a part a a particle of a

1197.059 --> 1203.21
wave a part wave what is that I've heard

1201.679 --> 1207.049
of it before by the way but in this

1203.21 --> 1209.27
context well I've heard it before but

1207.049 --> 1211.48
that was just technobabble to me at the

1209.27 --> 1211.48
time

1234.67 --> 1238.3300000000002
fall down there's a wave packet what

1236.98 --> 1241.27
makes more sense

1238.33 --> 1245.9499999999998
who knows I do though it would not be a

1241.27 --> 1248.74
wave though it would just be a substance

1245.95 --> 1249.3700000000001
that is kind of like stretchable or

1248.74 --> 1253.57
something

1249.37 --> 1256.36
a stretchable light if you want to call

1253.57 --> 1259.0
that a wavelet I don't know but it

1256.36 --> 1263.4099999999999
definitely does not seem to abide by the

1259.0 --> 1265.36
standard particle conceptualization Nord

1263.41 --> 1267.4
what a wave is which isn't even the

1265.36 --> 1270.76
substance in the first place secondary

1267.4 --> 1272.14
so hey if it is people have already kind

1270.76 --> 1276.51
of their thought about it it's

1272.14 --> 1278.97
interesting I'd love to look into that

1276.51 --> 1283.47
what they thought about it

1278.97 --> 1283.47
sure yeah

1286.06 --> 1291.31
yeah I know I did the funny thing is I

1289.21 --> 1293.79
do actually have a laser pointer I just

1291.31 --> 1296.83
don't have batteries for it right now

1293.79 --> 1298.93
and I've seen that before I you know

1296.83 --> 1301.75
what you don't need to convince me about

1298.93 --> 1305.3100000000002
the the diffraction effect the double

1301.75 --> 1305.31
slit I've seen that plenty of times

1331.67 --> 1338.19
nobody gives a [ __ ] turbo diesel get out

1334.68 --> 1341.04
of here troll this is not a queue for

1338.19 --> 1343.98
ballers to insert their [ __ ] about their

1341.04 --> 1349.34
ball belief okay this is just me

1343.98 --> 1349.34
personally researching certain subject

1349.7 --> 1358.6100000000001
from a fresh angle it doesn't mean

1354.42 --> 1361.8600000000001
anything it just means that I'm actually

1358.61 --> 1365.1799999999998
progressing my research unlike an entire

1361.86 --> 1367.32
group of people that just keep on

1365.18 --> 1369.45
regurgitating the same [ __ ] over and

1367.32 --> 1372.56
over again waiting for an opportunity to

1369.45 --> 1372.56
take a dump somewhere

1378.3 --> 1382.93
no now I'm not gonna be talking to qe2

1381.76 --> 1402.42
and why would I do that

1382.93 --> 1407.68
oh really so which results do I exclude

1402.42 --> 1410.5
ob1 do globey kind of name is there

1407.68 --> 1413.43
anyway I think it's funny

1410.5 --> 1413.43
just dumb

1423.24 --> 1426.43
[Music]

1427.88 --> 1433.14
so lovely when people just shove these

1430.86 --> 1435.27
assertion in my boots like yeah you

1433.14 --> 1439.71
don't do this oh really so what is it

1435.27 --> 1442.61
exactly that I don't know they or is it

1439.71 --> 1445.3500000000001
just your imagination running wild again

1442.61 --> 1447.9299999999998
because you're so used that it's just

1445.35 --> 1454.6799999999998
allowed to assert your fantasies it's

1447.93 --> 1456.98
normal maybe you could back it up in my

1454.68 --> 1456.98
chat

1457.85 --> 1462.9089999999999
or just ban you you know it's up to you

1471.58 --> 1477.96
yeah

1474.09 --> 1480.8999999999999
okay yeah yeah no [ __ ] of you and what

1477.96 --> 1482.97
of course I don't accept scientific

1480.9 --> 1486.8400000000001
consensus what kind of a dumb stance

1482.97 --> 1490.8600000000001
would that be what kind of progress is

1486.84 --> 1493.5
gonna come from scientific consensus how

1490.86 --> 1497.85
do you scientific consensus doesn't

1493.5 --> 1498.72
really help testing hypotheses if you

1497.85 --> 1506.36
know what I mean

1498.72 --> 1510.8700000000001
no it's the skeptics that don't accept

1506.36 --> 1513.4799999999998
the majority what they think and say for

1510.87 --> 1515.3999999999999
whatever reason which yeah why would you

1513.48 --> 1517.17
even assume that those reasons why

1515.4 --> 1521.73
people would go along with something

1517.17 --> 1524.52
would be because of yeah integrity in

1521.73 --> 1526.29
necessarily why wouldn't it just be like

1524.52 --> 1528.42
hey maybe it's Andy maybe we'll get

1526.29 --> 1530.84
subsidized this way because there's a

1528.42 --> 1534.3000000000002
lot of interest in this subject yeah

1530.84 --> 1536.6999999999998
you're kind of overlooking all that now

1534.3 --> 1539.82
consensus is really not a reliable

1536.7 --> 1544.5900000000001
source for truth at all just like

1539.82 --> 1548.36
democracy is not a very reliable not a

1544.59 --> 1548.36
very stable system

1548.84 --> 1554.6699999999998
yeah their raw democracy majority rule

1552.12 --> 1557.33
it doesn't work because people get

1554.67 --> 1561.48
caught up an ego [ __ ] and in other

1557.33 --> 1564.6499999999999
priorities happens a lot especially when

1561.48 --> 1564.65
money becomes involved

1565.97 --> 1573.049
mmm now I'll just go with the data and

1569.84 --> 1576.74
then make up my own mind and I happen to

1573.049 --> 1580.429
be very good at it so I would keep on

1576.74 --> 1582.59
doing that it's much more handy when I

1580.429 --> 1587.0590000000002
don't need to rely upon anyone else in

1582.59 --> 1592.73
order to draw my own conclusions and hey

1587.059 --> 1596.269
every time I do it I always end up you

1592.73 --> 1600.379
know bumping my knee and hurting it cuz

1596.269 --> 1605.21
I relied upon something about somebody

1600.379 --> 1613.399
else and their hearsay so yeah you know

1605.21 --> 1616.279
I just got to do what I got to do well

1613.399 --> 1619.1
Allen Helvetian a dictatorship is not

1616.279 --> 1621.879
the only alternative to democracy don't

1619.1 --> 1624.879
be an idiot talking about literal

1621.879 --> 1624.879
democracy

1629.5 --> 1632.5
No

1633.62 --> 1642.4099999999999
people should be ruled by good rules

1638.75 --> 1647.94
should be guided by rules and by rights

1642.41 --> 1651.66
so I prefer the Republic system much

1647.94 --> 1654.18
more over

1651.66 --> 1658.0500000000002
yeah the democracy approach because

1654.18 --> 1660.3
democracy is very prone to abrupt

1658.05 --> 1663.86
changes and that can completely derail a

1660.3 --> 1666.81
people and their identity and yeah and

1663.86 --> 1669.4799999999998
basically make such a country prone for

1666.81 --> 1670.8
a hostile takeover or corporate takeover

1669.48 --> 1675.75
some kind of enslavement

1670.8 --> 1678.26
so yeah democracy as a raw foundation no

1675.75 --> 1678.26
it's terrible

1678.74 --> 1686.82
the idea the hair say about it is like

1682.68 --> 1688.38
people that yeah voting is good but yeah

1686.82 --> 1695.4299999999998
people should not be allowed to vote

1688.38 --> 1697.94
things that basically are overstepping

1695.43 --> 1697.94
boundaries

1716.49 --> 1719.09
it's

1736.539 --> 1741.399
yeah I'm not look when I talk about

1739.209 --> 1746.499
democracy and not talking about the

1741.399 --> 1749.6789999999999
Democrats okay because I don't think

1746.499 --> 1755.349
they're very democratic really they are

1749.679 --> 1759.1290000000001
more like yeah they are really populist

1755.349 --> 1762.549
s-- but they indoctrinate their their

1759.129 --> 1765.879
group so they're like indoctrinate if

1762.549 --> 1771.339
populist it wouldn't really call that

1765.879 --> 1773.9489999999998
just blatant democracy usually just goes

1771.339 --> 1776.6789999999999
for the absolute standard baseline and

1773.949 --> 1778.539
logical things that everybody will go

1776.679 --> 1780.789
with because that's the majority right

1778.539 --> 1785.289
that's real too much that that rarely

1780.789 --> 1787.179
happens may happen for a while and then

1785.289 --> 1791.859
eventually other things will start to

1787.179 --> 1796.049
sneak in and yeah take the people for a

1791.859 --> 1796.049
wild ride so

1798.27 --> 1808.65
all right and yeah did I seriously like

1804.179 --> 1812.429
that the political system in the United

1808.65 --> 1814.2
States really is already yeah what

1812.429 --> 1814.98
they're represented parties what they

1814.2 --> 1818.3
represent

1814.98 --> 1820.83
they're also bound by groups and and

1818.3 --> 1822.4199999999998
society secret societies even you could

1820.83 --> 1825.71
say well maybe not that much but just

1822.42 --> 1828.72
agreements and deals and things that

1825.71 --> 1831.39
everything they present themselves as

1828.72 --> 1835.17
their political narrative it's all just

1831.39 --> 1839.51
nonsense at this point they're also

1835.17 --> 1842.429
bound that is basically a giant soup

1839.51 --> 1845.21
it's one party with two faces at this

1842.429 --> 1847.41
point really and a individuals may

1845.21 --> 1848.82
thinker on certain details so it's

1847.41 --> 1851.97
always going to be detail work it's

1848.82 --> 1856.01
always going to be the coating the

1851.97 --> 1858.54
clothing what clothing on top you know

1856.01 --> 1861.12
because it is all the same machine at

1858.54 --> 1867.05
this point it's all tied in the same

1861.12 --> 1871.02
groups and things and right so you know

1867.05 --> 1873.21
and the United States really isn't the

1871.02 --> 1875.73
only one out there although it is pretty

1873.21 --> 1880.4
bad with the United States it's like the

1875.73 --> 1885.84
machine is so big their federal machine

1880.4 --> 1890.3090000000002
that yeah you it's to become it's

1885.84 --> 1891.99
becoming too uniform it's just it's

1890.309 --> 1894.51
become impaired that's like Imperial

1891.99 --> 1897.98
ization that's what it is I talked about

1894.51 --> 1897.98
this before anyway

1898.429 --> 1903.3000000000002
yeah Europe s is pretty much has similar

1901.679 --> 1907.5900000000001
types of issues but that's just not

1903.3 --> 1909.47
enough cohesion so people are railing

1907.59 --> 1913.6999999999998
much harder against it

1909.47 --> 1913.7
your opinions just a mess

1915.81 --> 1930.46
ridiculous situation no the government

1924.43 --> 1932.43
system yeah people are opposing one

1930.46 --> 1935.98
another groups are opposing one another

1932.43 --> 1940.78
but they do it and what they eventually

1935.98 --> 1943.51
do what when they witness it were they

1940.78 --> 1947.6499999999999
use that system and therefore it's going

1943.51 --> 1949.5
to be very much the same approach that's

1947.65 --> 1953.26
my point

1949.5 --> 1955.51
not saying they're all uniform and it's

1953.26 --> 1957.43
literally an act I never claimed that no

1955.51 --> 1963.0
no no these people really oppose one

1957.43 --> 1963.0
another but they all use the same system

1969.56 --> 1972.56
yeah

1977.31 --> 1980.369
[Music]

1996.45 --> 2002.0900000000001
wow that's pretty sane insane ESP power

1999.51 --> 2003.35
if that's really true if you confirm

2002.09 --> 2005.7099999999998
that though or did you read that

2003.35 --> 2005.7099999999998
somewhere

2012.1 --> 2015.0
Lisa

2033.89 --> 2043.38
what are you talking about Trump did a

2037.2 --> 2045.3
terrible thing what what exactly I'm not

2043.38 --> 2049.1690000000003
saying he's been exactly perfect okay

2045.3 --> 2052.5
it's it's I don't have any more

2049.169 --> 2054.72
oversight like I can't figure it out

2052.5 --> 2057.149
maybe that's the idea maybe literally

2054.72 --> 2058.5899999999997
wants everybody to just not understand

2057.149 --> 2067.5499999999997
anymore I don't know what's going on

2058.59 --> 2067.55
really what

2074.8 --> 2079.2000000000003
I have no idea what you're talking about

2085.27 --> 2091.179
god

2087.819 --> 2092.419
whatever I don't believe a word

2091.179 --> 2095.7400000000002
seriously

2092.419 --> 2095.74
don't believe it

2113.33 --> 2119.36
yeah look it's so really nice I'll

2115.85 --> 2122.89
believe it when I see him stepping down

2119.36 --> 2122.8900000000003
okay I don't think it's gonna happen

2130.99 --> 2134.1699999999996
[Music]

2141.86 --> 2146.53
oh yeah sure sure

2147.13 --> 2153.4
no I don't think so I think it is

2150.32 --> 2158.3300000000004
absolute [ __ ] and if it was real

2153.4 --> 2160.31
then it would bring concerns and people

2158.33 --> 2165.5
would be talking about it that would

2160.31 --> 2169.22
kind of be on Trump side doesn't just I

2165.5 --> 2171.38
don't think it's look if it is real we

2169.22 --> 2174.77
all know you know if it is real it'll

2171.38 --> 2177.38
happen it's over okay so you can shove

2174.77 --> 2183.2
this [ __ ] around all day long it's

2177.38 --> 2187.4900000000002
happening uh remember oh yeah oh my god

2183.2 --> 2189.71
fired oh yeah well if it'll happen it'll

2187.49 --> 2196.0699999999997
happen but I don't think it'll happen so

2189.71 --> 2200.7200000000003
good luck with that you know definitely

2196.07 --> 2204.65
not really there's no sign that there's

2200.72 --> 2208.0299999999997
no proper reason for him to do that at

2204.65 --> 2208.03
this point no

2219.66 --> 2227.3689999999997
don't make that noise again

2221.19 --> 2231.8
what you don't like my my anxious Trump

2227.369 --> 2231.8
allergist voice

2235.329 --> 2242.569
you know how those Trump haters get they

2238.369 --> 2244.339
get all into this weird trance literally

2242.569 --> 2250.0389999999998
like they get into voodoo trance or

2244.339 --> 2251.569
something gonna go oh so bad and they

2250.039 --> 2257.7200000000003
don't know why they literally get

2251.569 --> 2262.88
possessed right yeah it's okay so you

2257.72 --> 2265.66
can truth it just yeah but when it

2262.88 --> 2265.6600000000003
happens it'll happen

2267.41 --> 2275.67
[Music]

2270.27 --> 2278.7
I disagree old school without allies is

2275.67 --> 2281.06
the biggest importers on earth we would

2278.7 --> 2281.06
think

2284.47 --> 2290.9199999999996
now what's really need is real allies

2287.4 --> 2293.9700000000003
that understand the situation and not

2290.92 --> 2296.56
are not gonna just follow their own plan

2293.97 --> 2299.2
what the United States needs and it's

2296.56 --> 2304.27
going to be extremely hard because of

2299.2 --> 2307.7799999999997
the last 50 years probably is get real

2304.27 --> 2313.54
allies with which they can basically

2307.78 --> 2317.9500000000003
settle down and purge all the the

2313.54 --> 2320.109
maniacs because they don't need any

2317.95 --> 2322.7799999999997
virtual signalling allies they don't

2320.109 --> 2325.5099999999998
need somebody to play the ACT game with

2322.78 --> 2329.9700000000003
them anymore because if nobody's really

2325.51 --> 2329.9700000000003
doing it anyways it's not working

2335.51 --> 2339.5600000000004
and I don't even know what allies you're

2337.76 --> 2341.3300000000004
even talking about you just keep on

2339.56 --> 2342.29
calling and allies allies can't you be

2341.33 --> 2351.89
more specific

2342.29 --> 2356.14
perhaps yeah purge the maniacs yes like

2351.89 --> 2361.66
the real serious [ __ ] the real criminals

2356.14 --> 2364.1
you know who they're just open criminals

2361.66 --> 2385.94
that are even still are in government

2364.1 --> 2395.23
still do that [ __ ] all that but hey it's

2385.94 --> 2398.18
still not getting any kind of in content

2395.23 --> 2399.2
as to what allies exactly you're

2398.18 --> 2404.27
referring to

2399.2 --> 2406.7799999999997
oh the Ukrainians think that Ukrainians

2404.27 --> 2409.78
are good allies

2406.78 --> 2409.78
really

2411.74 --> 2414.91
are you serious

2425.72 --> 2436.0
but allies for what to get in Russia's

2430.7 --> 2436.0
face I think that's a good idea

2439.8 --> 2444.63
I don't have ever looked at the freaking

2442.56 --> 2448.11
Ukrainian government and what goes on

2444.63 --> 2453.4100000000003
there it's just that really there's a

2448.11 --> 2456.3
reliable ally I don't know

2453.41 --> 2457.17
right exactly he's a mouse q thank you

2456.3 --> 2462.84
for reminding me

2457.17 --> 2464.4900000000002
yes it's a it just seemed to me not

2462.84 --> 2466.98
claiming it is absolute but it just

2464.49 --> 2471.6899999999996
seems like the entire Ukraine situation

2466.98 --> 2474.03
is a Democratic Party ploy in order to

2471.69 --> 2477.4500000000003
get in Russia's face potentially trigger

2474.03 --> 2479.5800000000004
some kind of world war [ __ ] if they

2477.45 --> 2481.3199999999997
needed to you know it's the freakin

2479.58 --> 2483.7799999999997
control it's grab less they just want

2481.32 --> 2485.5800000000004
the option they want the button they

2483.78 --> 2488.01
want the freakin button to blow it all

2485.58 --> 2490.2799999999997
up if they need to because they're

2488.01 --> 2490.28
maniacs

2509.97 --> 2515.43
yeah well we wonder globey how could you

2512.849 --> 2520.099
crane ever help the us in any way Moo ha

2515.43 --> 2522.72
ha yeah how well by triggering a war

2520.099 --> 2526.13
Custer us has a military industrial

2522.72 --> 2529.79
complex that Fester's basically is just

2526.13 --> 2533.099
the Empire it's what two stains it and

2529.79 --> 2537.569
they need reasons for United States to

2533.099 --> 2539.73
go to war to make money so to then have

2537.569 --> 2543.359
a bunch of crazy allies that are just

2539.73 --> 2548.03
out for war that's ideal and that's the

2543.359 --> 2551.609
excuse the Empire needs so that added

2548.03 --> 2554.7000000000003
yeah that's probably why they choose

2551.609 --> 2558.869
such allies let's it's not good for

2554.7 --> 2562.68
America it's good for the war it's good

2558.869 --> 2564.7200000000003
for the money it's gonna just cause more

2562.68 --> 2567.589
death eventually dude do you think that

2564.72 --> 2570.1499999999996
the people really care about

2567.589 --> 2571.5299999999997
functionality of the land that planned

2570.15 --> 2573.2400000000002
these things no they don't give a [ __ ]

2571.53 --> 2577.6800000000003
about the people they don't give a [ __ ]

2573.24 --> 2580.14
about anything but just getting their

2577.68 --> 2584.8999999999996
schemes rolling and making huge piles of

2580.14 --> 2584.9
money getting a lot of people killed so

2585.98 --> 2591.3
if the United States wants to be a

2588.3 --> 2594.569
really self-sufficient decent country

2591.3 --> 2597.329
and step away from the Satanic [ __ ] then

2594.569 --> 2600.619
they need to pick other types of allies

2597.329 --> 2602.4300000000003
and basically step away somehow

2600.619 --> 2606.0
deal with the military-industrial

2602.43 --> 2609.4199999999996
complex in a way that is somehow works

2606.0 --> 2612.53
and yeah can it is that possible or will

2609.42 --> 2615.42
it can it be postponed can they be put

2612.53 --> 2617.7200000000003
stand by is that even possible

2615.42 --> 2621.42
or will they then literally betray and

2617.72 --> 2623.9399999999996
just hand over their mercenary services

2621.42 --> 2626.099
to something else and could they I don't

2623.94 --> 2633.7200000000003
know I this complex [ __ ] you know this

2626.099 --> 2635.4500000000003
is like deep empire stuff so I don't

2633.72 --> 2638.3999999999996
even know if the United States can

2635.45 --> 2640.319
technically even step away from that or

2638.4 --> 2642.0
if it would require some kind of

2640.319 --> 2645.72
overwhelming clash

2642.0 --> 2648.93
to break the foundations of the military

2645.72 --> 2650.7599999999998
industry I don't know I have no idea how

2648.93 --> 2652.71
that works there's also a big chance

2650.76 --> 2654.3300000000004
that it would just become ten times as

2652.71 --> 2657.7200000000003
strong that they would bring out the

2654.33 --> 2659.97
secret [ __ ] start like the laser weapon

2657.72 --> 2665.16
age or whatever you know something like

2659.97 --> 2671.73
that you never really know with this

2665.16 --> 2676.89
kind of stuff anyway I think I'm gonna

2671.73 --> 2682.89
round out the show long enough no I'm

2676.89 --> 2685.5
not gonna unblock read and cook see no

2682.89 --> 2695.7599999999998
