right so weather has

95.6 --> 102.72
turned around it's

98.88 --> 105.83999999999999
cloudy it's been cloudy all night

102.72 --> 108.88
and yeah there's a strong wind

105.84 --> 111.119
like really strong so strong that in the

108.88 --> 111.119
night

111.28 --> 115.84
like yeah my balcony chair there

116.0 --> 119.52
went uh at it like a pinball machine

118.479 --> 121.67999999999999
again

119.52 --> 123.119
because there's a really strong wind

121.68 --> 126.71900000000001
happening and sometimes

123.119 --> 131.68
like some serious gusts

126.719 --> 134.959
break breakout and yeah the

131.68 --> 135.20000000000002
blossoming tree has been shedding a lot

134.959 --> 139.2
of

135.2 --> 143.83999999999997
uh blossom

139.2 --> 143.83999999999997
and right now it seems like it's

144.0 --> 150.959
kind of stabilized but yeah it's been

147.44 --> 152.8
blowing the blossom all over the place

150.959 --> 155.04
i thought at one point like what is it

152.8 --> 158.48000000000002
snowing but it was actually the blossom

155.04 --> 158.48
just going all over the place

159.04 --> 161.519
like that

164.64 --> 171.83999999999997
all right really restless weather

176.319 --> 179.92
hasn't been raining much though

181.84 --> 199.599
anyway lo tom parker first in chat

186.159 --> 205.599
logan's run good to see you both

199.599 --> 205.599
ah yeah i started a little late

205.76 --> 210.159
because i got up kind of late

210.319 --> 214.48
had overall a lot of sleep i went to bed

213.36 --> 227.84
pretty early but i

214.48 --> 227.83999999999997
basically slept like 10 hours

228.879 --> 236.319
really weird had a weird night like that

234.159 --> 239.439
so i'm also just dwelling on things that

236.319 --> 241.2
i normally don't really dwell on

239.439 --> 243.68
trying to keep my feelings at the

241.2 --> 245.92
distance

243.68 --> 245.92000000000002
uh

247.2 --> 251.04
it's weird how that works out sometimes

251.519 --> 258.88
uh right

255.84 --> 263.84000000000003
it's tuesday

258.88 --> 263.84
the 4th of may

266.84 --> 269.84
2021

276.0 --> 280.16
let's see what what we can make of the

277.919 --> 284.79999999999995
show today

280.16 --> 284.8
hey ralph rodriguez good to see you

288.88 --> 291.12
right

293.85 --> 298.24
[Music]

295.12 --> 302.0
flat earth debate yesterday

298.24 --> 304.0
was it was funny

302.0 --> 305.199
but also just kind of weird because

304.0 --> 308.32
nathan

305.199 --> 312.24
kept on going like the live show

308.32 --> 313.12
for what at least an hour extra beyond

312.24 --> 314.96000000000004
normal

313.12 --> 316.72
and then started the very short after

314.96 --> 318.08
show to round it out i don't know why he

316.72 --> 324.56
did that

318.08 --> 328.15999999999997
but a lot of people were in chat

324.56 --> 331.039
going up against sam again

328.16 --> 332.8
i wasn't out for groceries like during

331.039 --> 334.71999999999997
the live show and then yeah when i came

332.8 --> 339.199
back i noticed like hey it's still live

334.72 --> 340.8
what is this

339.199 --> 343.039
i'm probably going to do that today as

340.8 --> 343.039
well

343.12 --> 348.72
didn't yes i already said

346.8 --> 349.84000000000003
got up pretty late so i haven't gotten

348.72 --> 351.759
it

349.84 --> 353.44
i hadn't had any time to go out for

351.759 --> 355.759
groceries

353.44 --> 355.759
yet

358.16 --> 366.40000000000003
right uh

361.52 --> 381.84
own benjamin live over at gary terry

366.4 --> 381.84
that was very interesting and amusing

392.84 --> 395.84
huh

402.08 --> 405.35999999999996
sort of disappointing that nathan won't

404.56 --> 408.639
let sam

405.36 --> 411.28000000000003
finish his presentation

408.639 --> 411.28000000000003
about what

412.88 --> 417.68
i don't even remember like i wasn't

414.96 --> 420.56
there the entire time

417.68 --> 421.68
but that thing was going for a while you

420.56 --> 425.84
could hear that

421.68 --> 431.52
so i but the details are

425.84 --> 431.52
slipping me maybe it's been the long

434.84 --> 440.4
sleep

437.12 --> 441.039
i i'm typically yeah arweenian at the

440.4 --> 446.08
startup

441.039 --> 446.08
kind of like at a blank but that's okay

446.56 --> 451.84
eventually i'll get rolling

453.36 --> 458.08000000000004
[Music]

456.0 --> 459.12
right because whatever's inside of me i

458.08 --> 461.75899999999996
don't really want to

459.12 --> 461.759
put it out

462.639 --> 465.84000000000003
need to first

466.08 --> 473.039
probably call my healer about it

469.199 --> 476.08000000000004
because it was weird it felt like i

473.039 --> 476.84
basically played back a lot of the dark

476.08 --> 482.479
world

476.84 --> 482.479
things like try to make sense of it

482.8 --> 490.84000000000003
putting it all together from the past

488.08 --> 493.75899999999996
to figure out like what was i actually

490.84 --> 496.479
doing

493.759 --> 497.759
in that time what altogether was i doing

496.479 --> 499.52
and how

497.759 --> 502.0
one thing that i really tried to focus

499.52 --> 502.0
on is

503.039 --> 508.479
like how did i delude myself in certain

506.24 --> 510.8
things that might have slipped

508.479 --> 512.7189999999999
by most people because i didn't express

510.8 --> 515.039
a lot of it but how did i interpret

512.719 --> 515.0390000000001
things

515.68 --> 521.3599999999999
to stay safe and stable in situations

519.68 --> 524.3199999999999
where i should have probably had another

521.36 --> 524.32
type of response

526.56 --> 535.8389999999999
right anyway

542.16 --> 546.8389999999999
not much of a presentation if you don't

544.399 --> 548.16
allow the other person to present few

546.839 --> 550.8000000000001
points

548.16 --> 552.24
well they had so much time it's very

550.8 --> 557.519
likely that he just

552.24 --> 557.519
did get to present his viewpoints

559.6 --> 566.0
and nathan just broke in there and

562.399 --> 566.0
immediately defused them

566.08 --> 570.08
that's usually what happens i don't even

568.24 --> 572.16
need to know the details

570.08 --> 574.839
to know that that's how things tend to

572.16 --> 577.68
go over at the flat earth debates pat

574.839 --> 581.839
fee

577.68 --> 591.8389999999999
so all this complainy panting it's

581.839 --> 591.839
it's kind of a waste of time

598.88 --> 602.399
but in all honesty i would need to

600.8 --> 606.16
listen it back

602.399 --> 610.0
in its completion to basically judge

606.16 --> 612.88
if nathan was maybe pushing it a little

610.0 --> 615.04
he sometimes does that when he feels

612.88 --> 617.2
like it

615.04 --> 619.279
and i think that monday he did feel like

617.2 --> 621.6800000000001
it

619.279 --> 623.8389999999999
hey cameron kamikaze gilmore good to see

621.68 --> 623.8389999999999
you

624.959 --> 635.5189999999999
level-headed warriors

632.72 --> 637.9200000000001
does blackpool's one image is copper

635.519 --> 641.519
ranty's newly

637.92 --> 641.519
scupper what

643.76 --> 647.8389999999999
i don't know what that means

648.66 --> 651.74
[Music]

657.12 --> 663.04
oh sink the [Â __Â ]

660.72 --> 663.0400000000001
uh

663.76 --> 670.48
well it should right but like

667.12 --> 670.48
ranty is just

671.12 --> 675.839
being a zealot right now about it

682.64 --> 693.279
hey here we go again good morning

688.48 --> 693.279
prove him wrong right

693.68 --> 697.279
well yeah it does prove him wrong but

695.68 --> 702.079
that that was

697.279 --> 706.32
figured out very quickly

702.079 --> 708.959
uh well flat side was it that's a flat

706.32 --> 712.5600000000001
side had a new

708.959 --> 712.56
video short one

714.8 --> 718.56
or was at some of it was a tenth man

716.88 --> 720.16
there's been a lot of people

718.56 --> 721.92
just short videos it could have been on

720.16 --> 725.1999999999999
nathan's channel even

721.92 --> 728.7199999999999
was it brian trying to find it back

725.2 --> 728.72
so much communication there

728.8 --> 732.88
over at skype it's hard to keep track of

731.04 --> 737.5999999999999
it all

732.88 --> 740.639
oh wait was it from tony

737.6 --> 741.12
yeah i think yeah sleeping war had a

740.639 --> 745.839
really

741.12 --> 745.839
short video two minutes long

746.56 --> 753.1999999999999
and it just directly it's like very

749.92 --> 757.04
short and it directly translate

753.2 --> 761.6800000000001
my sentiment and very

757.04 --> 761.68
easily yeah good easy demonstration

761.839 --> 767.49
because as i even tried to explain on my

765.44 --> 769.0400000000001
show yesterday

767.49 --> 770.9590000000001
[Music]

769.04 --> 772.8
like there should be a bulge there

770.959 --> 775.5999999999999
should be a bulge of water

772.8 --> 776.24
blocking the yeah the bottom of the

775.6 --> 778.88
mountains

776.24 --> 780.32
and you see that on the left you should

778.88 --> 783.68
see that

780.32 --> 786.5600000000001
and it's it's not there

783.68 --> 787.04
because the water isn't sticking out

786.56 --> 790.399
because

787.04 --> 793.279
it's part of the curve of earth

790.399 --> 794.88
in order to geometrically block things

793.279 --> 797.8389999999999
from behind it that's not what the

794.88 --> 797.8389999999999
picture reveals

798.8 --> 802.399
it's that simple now ranty's still

801.04 --> 805.5999999999999
holding on there and he's

802.399 --> 808.959
going full ball tart with it just

805.6 --> 808.9590000000001
gaslighting himself

809.04 --> 811.36
really

813.44 --> 817.9200000000001
because that's what zealots end up doing

816.16 --> 819.76
like at some point they're not going to

817.92 --> 820.88
convince anybody else anymore but they

819.76 --> 822.8
can still

820.88 --> 824.24
convince themselves they gaslight

822.8 --> 826.7199999999999
themselves into believing

824.24 --> 828.9590000000001
like no this is proof of a ball even

826.72 --> 830.9590000000001
though they have no grip

828.959 --> 833.68
because anytime they say anything about

830.959 --> 836.56
it it doesn't match

833.68 --> 842.16
the actual evidence and that's just what

836.56 --> 848.16
zealots do

842.16 --> 848.16
i hope she has hello iron 26

852.48 --> 857.839
it's snowing blossom again out there

878.72 --> 888.0790000000001
that's [Â __Â ] agile seriously

884.399 --> 888.079
you people need to get a life

888.32 --> 892.8000000000001
doesn't matter how many people make

890.959 --> 895.8389999999999
videos to support ranty

892.8 --> 897.279
it's [Â __Â ] it's wrong they're stupid

895.839 --> 901.0400000000001
your baller zealot

897.279 --> 903.4399999999999
idiots nobody gives a [Â __Â ]

901.04 --> 905.36
if you think you're better than us flat

903.44 --> 907.36
earthers

905.36 --> 908.399
just because you have more people that

907.36 --> 911.839
are willingly

908.399 --> 927.839
stupid like you are doesn't matter

911.839 --> 927.839
it's flat it's flat get over it

939.04 --> 944.56
right yeah but that's the thing iron 26

944.8 --> 948.3199999999999
this is how they do it they have two

947.199 --> 952.4799999999999
things they do

948.32 --> 953.839
universally they have a straw man flat

952.48 --> 956.88
earth model

953.839 --> 960.0
very obviously straw man

956.88 --> 962.079
no no logical explanation how it

960.0 --> 963.519
like how it actually accounts for

962.079 --> 966.6389999999999
everything

963.519 --> 967.12
now attempt always oversimplified and

966.639 --> 968.88
then

967.12 --> 971.68
look it doesn't look like the picture

968.88 --> 971.68
yeah no [Â __Â ]

973.279 --> 976.8
then when flat earthers do it and i

976.16 --> 980.7199999999999
watch

976.8 --> 980.7199999999999
them like people like adam meekin

980.88 --> 985.279
they really bring out the works they

982.56 --> 988.3199999999999
take like all the factors into account

985.279 --> 990.16
and then yeah when they show it on a

988.32 --> 990.8000000000001
globe yeah then it looks completely

990.16 --> 994.079
different

990.8 --> 997.519
much like what you would be expecting

994.079 --> 998.399
on a globe and then the baller zealots

997.519 --> 1001.12
will tell them

998.399 --> 1002.72
no you got it wrong because it doesn't

1001.12 --> 1005.36
look like the picture

1002.72 --> 1006.0
because the picture is the globe because

1005.36 --> 1009.6800000000001
it's real

1006.0 --> 1012.72
see they don't give a [Â __Â ]

1009.68 --> 1015.12
about reality at all

1012.72 --> 1016.24
about logical consistency thinking

1015.12 --> 1020.079
anything

1016.24 --> 1022.399
they just want to indoctrinate everybody

1020.079 --> 1023.519
like themselves it's a globe no matter

1022.399 --> 1025.199
what

1023.519 --> 1027.28
that's what a zealot does and that's

1025.199 --> 1032.0
what these people in chat do

1027.28 --> 1034.16
too they're just gaslighting everybody

1032.0 --> 1036.839
but when you don't buy it then they end

1034.16 --> 1039.8390000000002
up just gaslighting

1036.839 --> 1039.839
themselves

1042.799 --> 1053.84
hey nathan oakley ninety eighty

1055.2 --> 1060.32
george sanford what model

1064.32 --> 1072.0
yeah like a uh raziel raziel

1068.88 --> 1072.48
here he's a zealot just everything it

1072.0 --> 1075.28
says

1072.48 --> 1077.2
is pure arrogance it's pure trickery

1075.28 --> 1079.52
gaslighting attempt

1077.2 --> 1081.8400000000001
like of course this is what rumpus does

1079.52 --> 1081.84
too

1081.919 --> 1095.8400000000001
except he's much more entertaining

1104.799 --> 1111.6
right but me personally

1108.559 --> 1116.16
look i'm not too interested in this

1111.6 --> 1116.1599999999999
level of doing things of just constantly

1116.64 --> 1121.2800000000002
going back and forth with globals to

1119.52 --> 1124.08
prove the earth is flat

1121.28 --> 1126.0
because i like to focus on the really is

1124.08 --> 1128.6399999999999
level on the mechanics

1126.0 --> 1129.52
and on modeling it in my head and then

1128.64 --> 1131.2800000000002
figuring out

1129.52 --> 1133.36
hey wait where are the things that

1131.28 --> 1135.9189999999999
people probably haven't touched

1133.36 --> 1136.7199999999998
because it's weird that's what i like

1135.919 --> 1139.919
right

1136.72 --> 1142.72
well you can't do that with clovers

1139.919 --> 1143.1200000000001
they don't care about reality they only

1142.72 --> 1146.0
care

1143.12 --> 1146.4799999999998
how can we trick everybody into reifying

1146.0 --> 1149.44
the

1146.48 --> 1150.88
whatever they're looking at into that

1149.44 --> 1152.64
has to be the globe that's the only

1150.88 --> 1153.2800000000002
thing they care about and i have no

1152.64 --> 1156.16
interest

1153.28 --> 1157.9189999999999
in playing that game with them

1156.16 --> 1161.2
constantly

1157.919 --> 1164.24
i'm interested in cosmogeny

1161.2 --> 1164.88
right now there's other people planning

1164.24 --> 1167.28
around

1164.88 --> 1169.2800000000002
that really love that [Â __Â ] they dive

1167.28 --> 1170.16
right on top of it and they keep on

1169.28 --> 1173.52
going like

1170.16 --> 1174.64
tony anthony riley he's a primary

1173.52 --> 1177.36
example of that and he

1174.64 --> 1179.679
has always been like that right and i

1177.36 --> 1181.9189999999999
totally get it in previous runs with the

1179.679 --> 1184.96
isle of man situation yes it was

1181.919 --> 1188.16
interesting to look at it but to me

1184.96 --> 1190.96
it was interesting because i didn't get

1188.16 --> 1192.96
the trickery yet

1190.96 --> 1195.52
and it was figuring out the trickery

1192.96 --> 1197.679
that was so fun for me

1195.52 --> 1200.8799999999999
and why it was worth sitting through it

1197.679 --> 1200.88
for such a long period

1201.28 --> 1206.559
but i am just not interested in the

1204.32 --> 1207.36
technical discussion constantly back and

1206.559 --> 1209.9189999999999
forth and

1207.36 --> 1211.6789999999999
trying to keep track of the math and

1209.919 --> 1212.4
then making sure that whatever they're

1211.679 --> 1215.039
gonna say

1212.4 --> 1216.48
actually fits what is real like that's

1215.039 --> 1219.52
tiresome to me

1216.48 --> 1223.039
i find that tiresome nerd rage

1219.52 --> 1223.039
it's i don't like that

1230.08 --> 1234.08
right so the best i i do in such

1232.72 --> 1236.88
situations is just

1234.08 --> 1238.559
directly start explaining the psychology

1236.88 --> 1241.7600000000002
not even going into the technical

1238.559 --> 1245.6
arguments because i don't

1241.76 --> 1247.84
want to give them a lead to start doing

1245.6 --> 1251.039
their thing

1247.84 --> 1252.24
start straw manning and gaslighting i i

1251.039 --> 1255.6
just don't want to

1252.24 --> 1256.4
it's tiresome now ever we know where

1255.6 --> 1258.8799999999999
this goes

1256.4 --> 1260.48
every time they will always end up

1258.88 --> 1263.5200000000002
declaring victory

1260.48 --> 1266.64
no matter what and they'll all

1263.52 --> 1269.52
chant they all chant

1266.64 --> 1270.96
all together shoulder to shoulder chant

1269.52 --> 1273.76
they will all do it

1270.96 --> 1275.039
until everybody is sick of it and starts

1273.76 --> 1277.919
leaving them alone again

1275.039 --> 1280.1589999999999
because it's boring they'll do this

1277.919 --> 1283.3600000000001
every single time

1280.159 --> 1286.64
right there is we we might

1283.36 --> 1291.6
win the technicals but we will never

1286.64 --> 1294.3200000000002
win their minds that is their religion

1291.6 --> 1294.32
you understand

1298.48 --> 1302.159
and their long-term strategy is to drain

1301.84 --> 1305.28
us

1302.159 --> 1308.48
is to keep us caught up

1305.28 --> 1311.84
in trying to defend the knowledge

1308.48 --> 1313.679
against people that don't care

1311.84 --> 1315.52
and it's a waste of energy really in the

1313.679 --> 1317.3600000000001
long run right it's good to have some

1315.52 --> 1319.28
training and to figure it out like what

1317.36 --> 1321.9189999999999
are they doing how does it work

1319.28 --> 1322.48
to test yourself perhaps how you do how

1321.919 --> 1326.0800000000002
you

1322.48 --> 1328.0
fare under stress under manipulation

1326.08 --> 1329.1999999999998
how do you deal with that it's good to

1328.0 --> 1332.0
test yourself right

1329.2 --> 1334.32
but to be always caught up in this or to

1332.0 --> 1338.559
be the loudest

1334.32 --> 1340.559
defender that's a waste of energy

1338.559 --> 1343.12
you're not gonna grow out of that you're

1340.559 --> 1343.12
just gonna

1343.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
strain yourself up

1352.799 --> 1359.28
yeah logan's run oh randy had

1356.64 --> 1360.7990000000002
glorious proof in the past that it's

1359.28 --> 1364.24
flat

1360.799 --> 1366.32
and he's yeah it doesn't really matter

1364.24 --> 1368.72
what what rant he thinks the earth is

1366.32 --> 1370.96
he always brings the best flat earth

1368.72 --> 1370.96
proof

1371.039 --> 1374.96
even though with this current one he's

1373.2 --> 1378.559
just saying no that

1374.96 --> 1381.52
that's a vowel that's a ball

1378.559 --> 1383.36
no it's not that's a really good black

1381.52 --> 1388.6399999999999
swan ranty

1383.36 --> 1392.8799999999999
it's a ball yeah

1388.64 --> 1396.3200000000002
or as i like to say all long distance

1392.88 --> 1398.24
footage is flat earth proof it like all

1396.32 --> 1401.039
distance footage

1398.24 --> 1402.0
every time you get it really far side

1401.039 --> 1405.76
it's always a black

1402.0 --> 1409.12
swan you should never

1405.76 --> 1411.52
be able to see that far on a ball

1409.12 --> 1414.7199999999998
yet would have endless amounts of

1411.52 --> 1414.72
pictures where you do

1415.039 --> 1419.44
right and just because at one time you

1418.159 --> 1421.3600000000001
didn't see that far

1419.44 --> 1423.44
that doesn't mean oh that's the real

1421.36 --> 1425.1999999999998
side that's it's because it's a globe

1423.44 --> 1427.6000000000001
and then at other times yeah you do see

1425.2 --> 1429.279
far now it's like oh that's so

1427.6 --> 1431.039
weird terrestrial refraction or

1429.279 --> 1433.679
something no that makes no freaking

1431.039 --> 1435.44
sense that's just being inconsistent

1433.679 --> 1437.2
that's the black swan argument

1435.44 --> 1438.88
terrestrial fraction there's no actual

1437.2 --> 1441.8400000000001
proof for it it's a paradox

1438.88 --> 1442.7990000000002
by nature by its own nature it's a

1441.84 --> 1445.84
paradox

1442.799 --> 1445.84
can't be established

1447.6 --> 1451.6
and the black swan argument is you can

1450.72 --> 1454.559
see

1451.6 --> 1455.039
this far that should never happen on the

1454.559 --> 1458.24
globe

1455.039 --> 1459.36
the geometry would always block it even

1458.24 --> 1462.0
with

1459.36 --> 1464.08
actual visual refraction effects that

1462.0 --> 1465.12
happen locally due to like moist in the

1464.08 --> 1468.6399999999999
air and all that

1465.12 --> 1471.039
like no it would always block that

1468.64 --> 1472.4
yet it doesn't in these long distance

1471.039 --> 1474.96
photographs

1472.4 --> 1476.799
which means it's not a sphere because if

1474.96 --> 1481.279
it was a sphere you would never

1476.799 --> 1483.52
see those photographs yet we do

1481.279 --> 1485.12
which means the earth is flat and not

1483.52 --> 1487.559
the sphere

1485.12 --> 1501.279
of the proportions that the

1487.559 --> 1503.039
heliocentrists claim

1501.279 --> 1505.679
hello amanda young by the way sorry

1503.039 --> 1505.679
popping in there

1507.2 --> 1511.44
otto von biscuit what the

1513.039 --> 1519.919
oh there's some more ball

1516.08 --> 1519.9189999999999
idiots in the chat that's fine

1520.96 --> 1525.3600000000001
they're all looking for new places to

1523.039 --> 1525.36
chant

1526.08 --> 1529.84
cropping a photo causes pain

1530.96 --> 1534.159
well i wouldn't say that

1538.24 --> 1543.84
it's just a bit obvious

1550.64 --> 1554.72
don't miss my biggest fan

1555.36 --> 1557.84
what

1561.76 --> 1573.12
i said hello to amanda young

1570.559 --> 1575.44
all right stallion 8012 did i say hello

1573.12 --> 1575.4399999999998
to you

1577.2 --> 1580.799
how to debunk looming

1581.52 --> 1584.96
well the thing is what type of looming

1583.919 --> 1588.48
are we talking about

1584.96 --> 1592.159
because looming displaces sights

1588.48 --> 1595.44
in relation to the horizon upward

1592.159 --> 1599.1200000000001
right in relation to the horizon

1595.44 --> 1601.679
that's looming so

1599.12 --> 1604.0
how could it displace things that are

1601.679 --> 1607.1200000000001
below the horizon

1604.0 --> 1608.88
because it's supposedly being blocked by

1607.12 --> 1611.6789999999999
the geometry

1608.88 --> 1614.72
above the horizon tell me how that works

1611.679 --> 1618.88
that's not looming looming

1614.72 --> 1623.52
doesn't show things that are blocked

1618.88 --> 1623.5200000000002
above it that's not how it works

1624.159 --> 1627.5200000000002
it doesn't just make things appear that

1627.12 --> 1631.039
we're

1627.52 --> 1633.44
invisible that's not looming looming

1631.039 --> 1636.64
visually just

1633.44 --> 1639.76
moves it up and yeah it's weird

1636.64 --> 1642.72
right but that's what it does

1639.76 --> 1643.76
doesn't oh look from behind oh there's

1642.72 --> 1645.6000000000001
more visible now

1643.76 --> 1647.36
things that were not visible no that's

1645.6 --> 1648.32
not what looming does that's not even

1647.36 --> 1653.1999999999998
how it's

1648.32 --> 1656.1589999999999
described it's all visual

1653.2 --> 1658.159
so this looming is not really looming

1656.159 --> 1662.7990000000002
it's terrestrial refraction

1658.159 --> 1665.0390000000002
exactly like nathan oakley 80 90 80 says

1662.799 --> 1666.799
it needs r because it's the terrestrial

1665.039 --> 1670.1589999999999
refraction machination

1666.799 --> 1671.84
it's science fiction it's the

1670.159 --> 1675.0390000000002
imagination that light can

1671.84 --> 1677.36
bend in a circle and you can see

1675.039 --> 1678.72
behind geometric obstruction because of

1677.36 --> 1681.12
it

1678.72 --> 1683.84
that's science fiction that's not real

1681.12 --> 1683.84
optics

1694.159 --> 1711.8400000000001
keep chanting bloody hell keep chanting

1720.799 --> 1724.24
long distance observation would be much

1722.64 --> 1727.5200000000002
longer what

1724.24 --> 1727.52
based on what brazil

1728.32 --> 1732.0
would be much longer and much more

1730.72 --> 1734.48
frequent

1732.0 --> 1735.279
so are you saying there are no

1734.48 --> 1740.3990000000001
refraction

1735.279 --> 1744.159
influences like water evaporating

1740.399 --> 1744.8799999999999
right above the water making the air

1744.159 --> 1749.1200000000001
thicker

1744.88 --> 1751.8400000000001
causing well angle of attack

1749.12 --> 1754.2399999999998
a mirroring effect which is part of what

1751.84 --> 1757.4399999999998
makes the horizon looks like the horizon

1754.24 --> 1758.3990000000001
no on a flat earth you shouldn't see

1757.44 --> 1762.159
much further

1758.399 --> 1766.4799999999998
you're still going to be subjected to

1762.159 --> 1769.7600000000002
what optics does

1766.48 --> 1769.76
the concealment effect

1770.08 --> 1774.24
and mirroring and all kinds of weird

1773.279 --> 1777.2
things

1774.24 --> 1778.799
and besides all that the preponderance

1777.2 --> 1782.72
of everything you're looking through

1778.799 --> 1782.72
eventually it's going to blur up

1783.44 --> 1788.0800000000002
which causes you to just not be able to

1785.76 --> 1790.96
see beyond there no matter

1788.08 --> 1792.799
how well you can zoom in because it's

1790.96 --> 1794.96
literally just blurred up it becomes

1792.799 --> 1796.96
a soup about of whatever background

1794.96 --> 1800.159
color there is on average

1796.96 --> 1802.72
you can't distinguish objects

1800.159 --> 1805.1200000000001
or even clouds or whatever they are

1802.72 --> 1807.52
anymore at that point

1805.12 --> 1809.279
it's the limit to the line of sight and

1807.52 --> 1811.76
that always happens it doesn't really

1809.279 --> 1816.08
matter what you're on

1811.76 --> 1816.08
like if you're on a mountain

1816.96 --> 1820.559
oh yeah well if you're on a really high

1818.799 --> 1824.24
mountain then you will see

1820.559 --> 1827.84
further your because the overall

1824.24 --> 1828.64
line of sight will be less air looking

1827.84 --> 1832.6399999999999
through you have

1828.64 --> 1834.24
a whole space standing up really high on

1832.64 --> 1836.72
that mountain

1834.24 --> 1838.24
where you have less air to look through

1836.72 --> 1839.919
unless it's like right in the middle of

1838.24 --> 1840.24
a cloud bank okay yeah then you don't

1839.919 --> 1842.64
see

1840.24 --> 1842.64
anything

1843.44 --> 1846.96
but it's really about the preponderance

1845.2 --> 1850.0
of air you're looking through

1846.96 --> 1853.52
that will eventually cause you to not be

1850.0 --> 1857.039
able to see anything anymore

1853.52 --> 1859.44
it's just a cap it's like a cap on site

1857.039 --> 1863.919
and the only way it would theoretically

1859.44 --> 1865.1200000000001
be removed is if it was a perfect vacuum

1863.919 --> 1868.159
the whole thing

1865.12 --> 1870.399
then your line of sight would not

1868.159 --> 1871.3600000000001
eventually become blurred up because

1870.399 --> 1873.5189999999998
there's no air

1871.36 --> 1874.8799999999999
to blur it up that's really what causes

1873.519 --> 1877.279
that i think

1874.88 --> 1879.279
in a lower pressure situation you would

1877.279 --> 1882.64
see further

1879.279 --> 1884.08
universally right but let's not worry

1882.64 --> 1886.3200000000002
about that because

1884.08 --> 1887.519
everything is so all fine then the air

1886.32 --> 1890.399
pressure will stay

1887.519 --> 1891.1200000000001
the same here that would be very

1890.399 --> 1895.76
preferable

1891.12 --> 1895.76
right it's not worth it to see further

1899.2 --> 1903.3600000000001
right so this idea that on a flat earth

1901.76 --> 1905.6
you would see much further no

1903.36 --> 1907.1999999999998
there's still a limit to sight because

1905.6 --> 1908.7199999999998
everything gets blurred up

1907.2 --> 1910.72
because of all the air you're looking

1908.72 --> 1915.1200000000001
through at some point

1910.72 --> 1917.76
it's gonna cause the light to diffuse

1915.12 --> 1919.039
and just refill the an average blend of

1917.76 --> 1920.799
background color

1919.039 --> 1922.799
instead of any objects that might be

1920.799 --> 1926.32
there even though

1922.799 --> 1928.96
with sufficient zooming capability

1926.32 --> 1930.08
you would technically still be able to

1928.96 --> 1931.8400000000001
make it out

1930.08 --> 1935.84
it's still not going to be visible

1931.84 --> 1935.84
because it's all blurred out

1966.88 --> 1971.519
hey nathan by the way good to have you

1969.2 --> 1971.519
in chat

1972.159 --> 1975.679
seems like the fundies are restless

1973.919 --> 1977.679
today

1975.679 --> 1979.1200000000001
not surprised with all that wind going

1977.679 --> 1981.8400000000001
about out there how is it

1979.12 --> 1982.7199999999998
is is it like that over in england as

1981.84 --> 1984.559
well

1982.72 --> 1991.84
maybe all of europe is now currently

1984.559 --> 1991.84
feeling the storm

2002.84 --> 2007.279
wow

2004.48 --> 2009.3600000000001
now that bloody hell dude you're lit

2007.279 --> 2011.279
like

2009.36 --> 2013.1999999999998
you're literally trying this is one of

2011.279 --> 2014.48
the examples of somebody trying to

2013.2 --> 2016.799
gaslight themselves

2014.48 --> 2018.559
right because who are in chat is

2016.799 --> 2021.9189999999999
actually buying

2018.559 --> 2026.08
bloody hell's gaslighting procedure

2021.919 --> 2028.88
it's ridiculous nobody's buying it buddy

2026.08 --> 2031.36
nobody not anybody in chat there's

2028.88 --> 2033.279
nobody desperate to hold on to something

2031.36 --> 2047.84
like that

2033.279 --> 2047.84
except you

2048.399 --> 2051.5989999999997
hey julie of heaven

2052.879 --> 2056.48
yeah talking about mung

2057.359 --> 2061.839
at least we don't use mong trig

2062.159 --> 2075.839
copyright nathan oakley 1980.

2093.44 --> 2097.28
hm well that's funny that you mention it

2095.919 --> 2099.52
bloody hell

2097.28 --> 2101.3590000000004
mister i'm gaslighting myself because

2099.52 --> 2103.68
nobody else is buying it

2101.359 --> 2104.56
yeah flat earth is kind of a comedy you

2103.68 --> 2108.72
know why

2104.56 --> 2108.72
because it brings out people like you

2109.04 --> 2114.88
people convinced

2112.48 --> 2116.32
they can gaslight everybody the entire

2114.88 --> 2121.52
world into their

2116.32 --> 2121.52
petty ill thought through beliefs

2122.88 --> 2131.839
right and you project your position

2126.16 --> 2131.839
on our position

2134.72 --> 2140.0
and that's kind of hilarious it's tragic

2137.359 --> 2144.96
but it's hilarious because

2140.0 --> 2148.4
that always seems to happen

2144.96 --> 2151.44
right people like you always come back

2148.4 --> 2151.44
and start doing that

2154.079 --> 2159.3590000000004
and that's yeah that i guess gives it a

2157.28 --> 2161.2000000000003
comedic function there's always always

2159.359 --> 2164.16
somebody spiraling

2161.2 --> 2164.72
out there in response to some flat earth

2164.16 --> 2167.7599999999998
thing

2164.72 --> 2169.68
some flat earth show

2167.76 --> 2171.119
how many other platforms are there where

2169.68 --> 2175.44
that happens and it's not

2171.119 --> 2178.88
super predictable and lame

2175.44 --> 2181.28
oh well maybe those people think that is

2178.88 --> 2183.04
amusing too right like with the whole

2181.28 --> 2185.8390000000004
sjw situation

2183.04 --> 2187.359
right wing like there's all kinds of

2185.839 --> 2189.839
games being played with that

2187.359 --> 2191.5989999999997
and gaslighting attempts too political

2189.839 --> 2196.24
gaslighting right

2191.599 --> 2198.839
well you are it over here

2196.24 --> 2200.7999999999997
except your entire position is totally

2198.839 --> 2204.48
absurd

2200.8 --> 2207.76
because you have no arguments every

2204.48 --> 2210.88
assumption you use as an argument is all

2207.76 --> 2212.48
false it's all false premise straw man

2210.88 --> 2214.32
models

2212.48 --> 2215.839
ideas that are ill thought through not

2214.32 --> 2218.2400000000002
really completed

2215.839 --> 2220.7999999999997
pure at home you all seem to know

2218.24 --> 2224.3999999999996
exactly how to study up

2220.8 --> 2227.52
on every person you don't like and

2224.4 --> 2228.1600000000003
get out as much boxing info you can get

2227.52 --> 2230.72
together

2228.16 --> 2231.5989999999997
and try to really make it personal and

2230.72 --> 2233.839
nasty

2231.599 --> 2235.3590000000004
like that's what you end up doing every

2233.839 --> 2239.119
time because you're really

2235.359 --> 2241.68
pathetic petty losers and bullies

2239.119 --> 2243.92
that have no life have no arguments have

2241.68 --> 2247.04
a false belief

2243.92 --> 2250.079
are very eager to dive down way

2247.04 --> 2251.2799999999997
into bloody hell as your own name even

2250.079 --> 2255.52
says

2251.28 --> 2259.3590000000004
to go to hell to do their stupid little

2255.52 --> 2259.92
useless thing to gaslight the entire

2259.359 --> 2262.0789999999997
world

2259.92 --> 2270.56
and they think that it works but it's

2262.079 --> 2273.52
only working on themselves

2270.56 --> 2274.7999999999997
oh really so what do i know about you

2273.52 --> 2277.599
are you projecting see

2274.8 --> 2278.8
this is this guy is completely out of

2277.599 --> 2284.48
insane

2278.8 --> 2286.88
completely insane like how am i doxing

2284.48 --> 2287.76
how does that work you literally just

2286.88 --> 2291.04
mentioned

2287.76 --> 2293.5200000000004
some private details that relate to me

2291.04 --> 2296.839
obviously because you scraped it

2293.52 --> 2299.119
together with your other parasites

2296.839 --> 2299.92
right you know how to get your

2299.119 --> 2301.92
information

2299.92 --> 2304.0
to at home people you know how to get it

2301.92 --> 2304.56
together you got probably got your own

2304.0 --> 2307.28
lists

2304.56 --> 2308.88
for that like targets and this is the

2307.28 --> 2311.2000000000003
info we got on them this is

2308.88 --> 2313.44
how you could get them yeah you're

2311.2 --> 2317.2
really sick [Â __Â ] gammas

2313.44 --> 2320.64
really psycho psycho psycho

2317.2 --> 2323.2
you're psycho completely psycho

2320.64 --> 2325.1189999999997
and you're okay with that and that's

2323.2 --> 2328.48
just

2325.119 --> 2329.599
that's comedy somebody calling

2328.48 --> 2333.359
completely

2329.599 --> 2334.2400000000002
berserk and basically like satanically

2333.359 --> 2337.2799999999997
evil

2334.24 --> 2338.24
they'll go there just there they get

2337.28 --> 2341.76
really sick

2338.24 --> 2346.3999999999996
and why because we don't

2341.76 --> 2350.1600000000003
want to accept their consensus belief

2346.4 --> 2350.1600000000003
and that's how [Â __Â ] up you are

2350.32 --> 2355.839
how is that how is that for comedy

2361.44 --> 2366.64
you just you just seem to think it's

2364.0 --> 2366.64
okay that

2367.04 --> 2374.16
you can just get in places and

2371.119 --> 2377.04
go get pushy until you think that people

2374.16 --> 2380.64
will submit to your bullying

2377.04 --> 2384.079
like a scumbag piece of [Â __Â ]

2380.64 --> 2386.96
you think that that's normal you're

2384.079 --> 2386.96
a psycho

2389.28 --> 2397.8390000000004
it is okay now you're a psycho dude

2393.599 --> 2397.839
do you know

2400.32 --> 2408.079
gaslighting psycho

2403.52 --> 2408.079
think you can fool the entire world and

2408.56 --> 2411.92
what you're doing is justified in any

2410.72 --> 2425.839
kind of way

2411.92 --> 2425.839
morally this is no you're a psycho

2431.359 --> 2435.68
see he knows i just wanted to highlight

2435.28 --> 2438.1600000000003
it

2435.68 --> 2440.96
it's just like sometimes you know when

2438.16 --> 2443.839
the cockroaches are scurrying around

2440.96 --> 2445.119
you gotta put a jar over them and study

2443.839 --> 2448.16
like what is this

2445.119 --> 2451.44
what is this this insect

2448.16 --> 2453.68
crawling around always appearing

2451.44 --> 2455.599
whenever i move something

2453.68 --> 2458.8799999999997
you got to show it and that's what i'm

2455.599 --> 2458.88
doing to you right now

2461.04 --> 2466.48
right and i can literally squash you

2464.24 --> 2467.68
like a bug any second i could just do it

2466.48 --> 2469.76
just like that

2467.68 --> 2470.72
still you keep on crawling and crawling

2469.76 --> 2473.44
and

2470.72 --> 2474.3999999999996
like yeah i'm the winner i'm the winner

2473.44 --> 2477.52
i'm the winner

2474.4 --> 2479.44
i'm crawling i'm being nasty

2477.52 --> 2481.359
yeah but i could literally squash you

2479.44 --> 2484.2400000000002
just like that with a click of button

2481.359 --> 2484.24
and you're out of here

2486.8 --> 2491.44
and i am going to do that but i just

2488.96 --> 2494.16
wanted to highlight what goes around in

2491.44 --> 2498.7200000000003
this chat sometimes

2494.16 --> 2498.72
right so

2501.28 --> 2504.0
there you go

2504.64 --> 2509.839
bye now

2512.83 --> 2516.0
[Music]

2519.61 --> 2522.6890000000003
[Music]

2527.839 --> 2532.7999999999997
yeah and in all that time he was just

2531.04 --> 2535.599
convinced that he was

2532.8 --> 2536.8
making some win of some kind it's it's

2535.599 --> 2540.2400000000002
total insanity

2536.8 --> 2543.76
that's why i say the primary

2540.24 --> 2546.4799999999996
thing they do is gaslighting themselves

2543.76 --> 2547.2000000000003
the whole dance is not meant to convince

2546.48 --> 2550.0
the world

2547.2 --> 2551.2
even though in their minds and feelings

2550.0 --> 2555.44
it does

2551.2 --> 2557.68
it's really there to convince themselves

2555.44 --> 2560.079
that they cannot be defeated in their

2557.68 --> 2560.0789999999997
belief

2560.96 --> 2564.96
that they cannot be tricked by the

2562.96 --> 2569.28
outside world to

2564.96 --> 2572.319
lay it down for facts and

2569.28 --> 2576.079
floor perspective and all these things

2572.319 --> 2578.56
made up by us that yeah actually

2576.079 --> 2580.319
dig into the real material out there and

2578.56 --> 2583.119
get all empirical and all that

2580.319 --> 2583.839
that's just that's not for them now they

2583.119 --> 2586.7200000000003
just

2583.839 --> 2588.4
want to echo what they originally

2586.72 --> 2593.839
learned

2588.4 --> 2593.839
and just chant

2594.4 --> 2597.92
because that's all they could do they

2596.0 --> 2600.88
don't have any facts

2597.92 --> 2602.4
they don't have any proper models they

2600.88 --> 2607.44
don't have any

2602.4 --> 2621.839
interest in figuring out the truth

2607.44 --> 2621.839
only in reification

2649.92 --> 2658.96
uh who is closer to satan

2654.4 --> 2662.0
well what is satan to me satan

2658.96 --> 2664.4
i i'm an asset terrorist to me satan is

2662.0 --> 2664.4
lies

2665.44 --> 2672.4
the deflection of truth god is truth

2669.28 --> 2675.0400000000004
satan is lies right

2672.4 --> 2675.839
it's just an aspect that's because in

2675.04 --> 2678.16
that sense

2675.839 --> 2679.839
it's not a personification it's more a

2678.16 --> 2682.8799999999997
structural thing

2679.839 --> 2685.7599999999998
right so when i basically

2682.88 --> 2687.359
put somebody next to satan it means

2685.76 --> 2690.2400000000002
they're lying

2687.359 --> 2690.64
really heavily and being exposed and

2690.24 --> 2693.04
still

2690.64 --> 2693.04
lying

2695.92 --> 2699.52
right it's a visceral thing

2700.96 --> 2705.52
so yeah if i'm going to point that out

2703.04 --> 2708.079
about somebody how is that lying

2705.52 --> 2709.28
i'm talking the truth i'm actually

2708.079 --> 2711.599
showing

2709.28 --> 2712.6400000000003
the thing highlighting literally

2711.599 --> 2715.839
highlighting

2712.64 --> 2718.96
shining a light upon it on the darkness

2715.839 --> 2719.68
on the lies that are attempting to stay

2718.96 --> 2722.48
hidden

2719.68 --> 2723.68
i reveal it so how is talking about

2722.48 --> 2728.0
satan

2723.68 --> 2730.56
in that sense being closer to satan

2728.0 --> 2733.2
right only way you could say it's being

2730.56 --> 2734.16
closer to satan is to be closer to your

2733.2 --> 2735.9199999999996
enemies

2734.16 --> 2739.1189999999997
keep your friends close your enemies

2735.92 --> 2740.8
closer know it know them

2739.119 --> 2742.319
so that you might prevent them from

2740.8 --> 2745.6800000000003
doing damage

2742.319 --> 2747.68
right and and probably the ballers

2745.68 --> 2749.44
from their own delusional standpoint are

2747.68 --> 2752.0789999999997
attempting this too they just

2749.44 --> 2752.88
attempt it purely based on psychology

2752.079 --> 2755.04
gaslighting

2752.88 --> 2756.1600000000003
ad homing making it personal peer

2755.04 --> 2760.079
pressure

2756.16 --> 2760.8799999999997
anything but actual real world facts and

2760.079 --> 2763.28
logic

2760.88 --> 2765.2000000000003
those things are avoided like the plague

2763.28 --> 2768.7200000000003
only virtue signaled to and

2765.2 --> 2768.72
replaced with machinations

2772.0 --> 2776.4
be like them to know them better no no

2774.24 --> 2779.2799999999997
no no that's not how it work keep them

2776.4 --> 2780.64
close don't become your enemy just keep

2779.28 --> 2784.48
them close

2780.64 --> 2787.359
get to know them not to be

2784.48 --> 2803.839
like them that's ridiculous that's

2787.359 --> 2803.839
totally pointless

2806.24 --> 2811.2799999999997
oh i was taking star wars right away

2821.599 --> 2826.079
right that's a complicated or a good

2824.4 --> 2831.839
question why do ballers hang with

2826.079 --> 2831.8390000000004
fe anyway why do they do it

2838.4 --> 2845.599
i don't know you know why

2841.44 --> 2848.7200000000003
because when i was a baller

2845.599 --> 2852.319
i did not get like

2848.72 --> 2855.1189999999997
ballers we know in chat in the face of

2852.319 --> 2855.119
flat earthers

2856.559 --> 2859.599
like in a way back then i thought like

2858.72 --> 2862.64
oh they're

2859.599 --> 2867.2000000000003
they're they're killing my dream

2862.64 --> 2868.64
but there's something about it

2867.2 --> 2870.0
right there's something the flat

2868.64 --> 2871.68
earthers know something there's

2870.0 --> 2872.8
something i even knew it back then when

2871.68 --> 2875.1189999999997
i didn't

2872.8 --> 2877.04
really latch onto it and it would always

2875.119 --> 2879.04
just leave him alone

2877.04 --> 2881.359
i would be like oh my god that's like

2879.04 --> 2882.0
really shocking jarring to suddenly feel

2881.359 --> 2886.64
like a

2882.0 --> 2888.559
big chunk of what you're into is false

2886.64 --> 2890.16
then just step away i don't understand

2888.559 --> 2893.76
how these ballers keep on

2890.16 --> 2896.96
coming back constantly and doing this

2893.76 --> 2896.96
i don't know how that works

2899.359 --> 2903.44
but it seems like they're just going

2901.28 --> 2906.0
into very petty

2903.44 --> 2907.04
places that i would avoid like the

2906.0 --> 2909.52
plague

2907.04 --> 2911.119
now and would be really ashamed of and

2909.52 --> 2915.599
in the past i've had my

2911.119 --> 2918.96
own dwellings like that my bad behavior

2915.599 --> 2920.96
social behavior like that

2918.96 --> 2922.319
not about the flat earth necessary but

2920.96 --> 2925.44
about other things

2922.319 --> 2928.8
things that triggered me then

2925.44 --> 2930.64
but i would always be very ashamed of it

2928.8 --> 2933.44
because it's weakness and i knew that

2930.64 --> 2933.44
intuitively

2935.76 --> 2942.559
yet these people come in and they're

2940.48 --> 2944.319
they're all in it together and they're

2942.559 --> 2948.3190000000004
like proud of doing it

2944.319 --> 2948.319
that's totally insane

2953.599 --> 2960.6400000000003
that's yeah that's just so delusional

2957.2 --> 2971.839
that i would consider that evil but it's

2960.64 --> 2975.839
more weakness than it's really evil

2971.839 --> 2975.839
oh man look at that

2982.839 --> 2985.839
see

2993.119 --> 2999.839
pretty crazy huh

3010.839 --> 3013.839
hmm

3022.0 --> 3026.64
might be easier to ask why if you hang

3024.0 --> 3030.16
around on the baller channel

3026.64 --> 3032.0
just because you don't right yeah i know

3030.16 --> 3035.5989999999997
some flat earthers do that i think

3032.0 --> 3035.599
they're really doing it to test their

3038.839 --> 3041.839
skills

3069.599 --> 3083.839
all right

3094.839 --> 3098.48
so

3096.16 --> 3099.52
i just don't really understand why they

3098.48 --> 3102.64
continued

3099.52 --> 3104.8
continually doing do it because

3102.64 --> 3106.64
in my experience anytime you go into a

3104.8 --> 3108.4
position where you're trying to gaslight

3106.64 --> 3110.4
the entire world

3108.4 --> 3112.1600000000003
you always end up just gaslighting

3110.4 --> 3114.4
yourself in the end if you hold on

3112.16 --> 3118.3999999999996
for very long to it you don't take the

3114.4 --> 3118.4
chance to basically redeem your position

3118.48 --> 3121.599
that eventually gives you

3120.33 --> 3124.319
[Music]

3121.599 --> 3127.04
it drains you and it makes you feel

3124.319 --> 3129.92
really stupid

3127.04 --> 3133.2
like stupid and delusional is a very bad

3129.92 --> 3133.2000000000003
combination to feel

3135.839 --> 3144.0789999999997
like i don't know about guys out there

3141.28 --> 3145.119
but when i would hang on to that sort of

3144.079 --> 3147.28
position and

3145.119 --> 3148.88
thankfully very sparingly they haven't

3147.28 --> 3152.0
done it in a long time

3148.88 --> 3154.6400000000003
when you hold on to that it felt to me

3152.0 --> 3157.119
like like you would contract brain

3154.64 --> 3160.96
damage from that it would literally like

3157.119 --> 3162.319
just make the the electrical system just

3160.96 --> 3164.48
feel disjointed

3162.319 --> 3166.0
and i wouldn't have like a week of

3164.48 --> 3168.2400000000002
concentration problems and

3166.0 --> 3168.24
[Â __Â ]

3169.2 --> 3175.68
serious so i don't know why they do it

3173.28 --> 3180.079
it's probably really unhealthy for them

3175.68 --> 3181.9199999999996
to do it

3180.079 --> 3185.2000000000003
and that's what makes it so ridiculous

3181.92 --> 3185.2000000000003
that they still do it

3185.839 --> 3190.7999999999997
despite the effect it probably has on

3188.24 --> 3192.3999999999996
them like is it really worth trying to

3190.8 --> 3196.2400000000002
gaslight everybody

3192.4 --> 3197.839
and discouraging them demoralizing

3196.24 --> 3200.8799999999997
for what you're going to be feeling

3197.839 --> 3200.88
afterward from that

3201.28 --> 3206.0
is that what you want don't don't you

3204.24 --> 3207.7599999999998
want to go in the other direction don't

3206.0 --> 3211.839
you want to get a better grip

3207.76 --> 3216.0
on everything getting real

3211.839 --> 3216.0
try it out why don't you try out

3216.4 --> 3219.92
flat earth why don't you try it out

3218.96 --> 3222.0
actually just

3219.92 --> 3223.44
letting yourself become like a flat

3222.0 --> 3225.28
earther for once

3223.44 --> 3226.8
it's gonna clear up your system like

3225.28 --> 3228.48
click crazy

3226.8 --> 3230.4
you're gonna have clarity that you've

3228.48 --> 3233.44
never experienced before and this is

3230.4 --> 3236.0
almost a guarantee

3233.44 --> 3240.079
unless you've been on like very heavy

3236.0 --> 3240.079
medication or whatever that can kind of

3240.48 --> 3244.48
take away from that unfortunately

3247.119 --> 3250.48
but hey if it's all so wrong and silly

3249.92 --> 3254.8
then

3250.48 --> 3254.8
be one see what it feels like

3255.119 --> 3258.6400000000003
for a lot of us flat earthers myself

3257.44 --> 3262.4
included

3258.64 --> 3262.4
when we first experienced all this

3262.72 --> 3266.0
you just don't really want to go back

3265.599 --> 3269.6800000000003
but

3266.0 --> 3272.0
before the internet before 2015

3269.68 --> 3273.839
when just showed that there were more

3272.0 --> 3277.04
people

3273.839 --> 3278.72
there was nobody to go to so you would

3277.04 --> 3282.5589999999997
just try to lock it

3278.72 --> 3283.839
up put it back put the flat earth back

3282.559 --> 3286.0
in the closet

3283.839 --> 3287.839
lock it up throw away the key and then

3286.0 --> 3289.92
hope you don't find it for a very long

3287.839 --> 3292.96
time because there was nobody who was

3289.92 --> 3295.839
going to sympathize with you about it

3292.96 --> 3295.839
barely anybody

3296.48 --> 3300.559
yet it would churn on you now there is

3298.4 --> 3303.44
the community and so it's just like yeah

3300.559 --> 3303.44
it's time to just

3303.599 --> 3309.2000000000003
take this and become that

3311.359 --> 3316.48
it's such a weird comparison by the way

3313.52 --> 3319.599
coming out of the closet

3316.48 --> 3320.319
because of the other association gayness

3319.599 --> 3322.6400000000003
and all that

3320.319 --> 3325.44
well i i bet that to a whole bunch of

3322.64 --> 3325.44
people out there

3325.92 --> 3329.6800000000003
gay is like oh no that's normal like of

3328.559 --> 3330.799
course you're going to come out of the

3329.68 --> 3335.04
class blah blah

3330.799 --> 3338.799
but flat earth oh my god like flat earth

3335.04 --> 3338.799
is like what gay used to be

3342.88 --> 3345.92
even though i see it the other way

3344.48 --> 3351.359
around like gay is

3345.92 --> 3351.359
something like dude put it in the closet

3351.68 --> 3363.839
close it up fuse the lock

3355.76 --> 3363.8390000000004
then bury it under concrete

3369.119 --> 3377.839
did i ever buy it no i got another bible

3380.559 --> 3389.3590000000004
mactune sent me sent me one remember

3384.72 --> 3392.0
there it is nlt so yeah i did get one

3389.359 --> 3392.0
a bubble

3393.68 --> 3398.5589999999997
pretty nice one too so see so there

3401.68 --> 3410.24
i don't do much with it to be fair

3404.799 --> 3410.24
but i'm very happy i have one and a good

3416.839 --> 3419.839
one

3437.28 --> 3439.599
all right

3441.2 --> 3444.64
well comic cameron kamikaze gilmore to

3443.52 --> 3448.16
kind of like rhine

3444.64 --> 3451.44
round at the train of thought yeah maybe

3448.16 --> 3454.8799999999997
gay people are like that maybe

3451.44 --> 3458.0
they think it's okay to just

3454.88 --> 3461.839
ram the flat earth back into oblivion

3458.0 --> 3461.839
because they're gay

3487.839 --> 3492.96
no no i definitely

3491.359 --> 3503.839
opened it multiple times and read

3492.96 --> 3503.839
through it

3504.319 --> 3517.839
you leave

3523.44 --> 3530.559
wow okay that's very special of you

3528.4 --> 3533.359
china orbital station so do you have any

3530.559 --> 3533.3590000000004
footage of that

3533.44 --> 3537.599
it just sounds like you're making up

3542.839 --> 3545.839
[Â __Â ]

3559.52 --> 3573.839
yeah that's a good point

3583.04 --> 3587.839
just search youtube no

3591.28 --> 3598.1600000000003
i mean did you read an article

3595.2 --> 3599.04
some article somewhere there's a lot of

3598.16 --> 3601.2799999999997
articles

3599.04 --> 3603.68
including very high level sci-fi

3601.28 --> 3606.799
articles that get written

3603.68 --> 3608.799
to kind of like plant ideas

3606.799 --> 3610.72
there's a lot of that going on out there

3608.799 --> 3615.839
doesn't mean it's actually happening

3610.72 --> 3615.839
at all

3618.4 --> 3629.839
tian kong space station okay okay

3621.92 --> 3629.839
google that

3638.559 --> 3644.079
how will they build it uh

3646.48 --> 3653.04
wow so it's not

3649.68 --> 3656.16
built at all there's

3653.04 --> 3657.04
just animations of how they would build

3656.16 --> 3660.72
it

3657.04 --> 3660.72
how's very very special

3660.88 --> 3665.28
this is all just 3d animation [Â __Â ] it's

3664.0 --> 3668.16
all of it it's 3d

3665.28 --> 3670.7200000000003
animation [Â __Â ] everything that i'm

3668.16 --> 3673.04
scrolling through right now

3670.72 --> 3674.72
it's not even claimed to have been any

3673.04 --> 3685.839
part of it being built

3674.72 --> 3685.839
so yeah

3691.119 --> 3694.6400000000003
you know where the telescope is right

3692.72 --> 3699.839
well where's the footage then

3694.64 --> 3699.839
azio where is that footage then yeah

3702.64 --> 3713.839
dude this is ridiculous

3714.48 --> 3720.64
if you can see it in a telescope then

3716.799 --> 3720.64
where is the footage of it

3720.88 --> 3725.599
if you were actually all into space

3723.119 --> 3728.079
stations assembly and all that and you

3725.599 --> 3729.44
are like a baller that thinks yeah why

3728.079 --> 3732.2400000000002
did they

3729.44 --> 3732.559
not have the assembly footage of the iss

3732.24 --> 3735.52
what

3732.559 --> 3737.44
what a waste how stupid that they didn't

3735.52 --> 3739.599
get that

3737.44 --> 3741.76
aren't you going to be like live

3739.599 --> 3744.48
streaming with your telescope

3741.76 --> 3747.119
every single second to see exactly the

3744.48 --> 3749.52
whole process of how it gets assembled

3747.119 --> 3751.92
just because it's so awesome so where's

3749.52 --> 3754.4
that footage all i can find is a lot of

3751.92 --> 3755.92
3d animation

3754.4 --> 3758.0
how they would do it it's not even

3755.92 --> 3760.88
claimed to have any anything about it

3758.0 --> 3760.88
being done yet

3766.839 --> 3769.839
serious

3780.839 --> 3783.839
so

3792.4 --> 3800.88
oh okay so yeah they are going to

3796.72 --> 3803.9199999999996
do that supposedly all right

3800.88 --> 3807.839
well maybe hey look maybe china is

3803.92 --> 3811.28
engaging in like oh we're going to

3807.839 --> 3813.52
reinforce space with this

3811.28 --> 3815.52
maybe they are trying it maybe this is

3813.52 --> 3817.119
like a new genuine attempt to do

3815.52 --> 3819.68
something like that

3817.119 --> 3821.28
but to me so far it just seems like a

3819.68 --> 3823.5989999999997
bunch of animations

3821.28 --> 3825.6800000000003
and promises like a whole bunch of

3823.599 --> 3826.559
promises of a whole bunch of things have

3825.68 --> 3828.3999999999996
been done

3826.559 --> 3831.599
never really showed anything beyond

3828.4 --> 3835.599
animations even when it was supposedly

3831.599 --> 3838.2400000000002
actually happening right so

3835.599 --> 3841.6800000000003
best of luck with that you want to dream

3838.24 --> 3844.3999999999996
about chinese space stations

3841.68 --> 3845.1189999999997
good good luck with that have fun with

3844.4 --> 3853.839
that

3845.119 --> 3853.839
it's all [Â __Â ] though

3854.64 --> 3859.68
but yeah that's what you're into get it

3860.72 --> 3869.52
it doesn't prove anything though

3866.72 --> 3871.2799999999997
but i'm sure that a lot of flat earthers

3869.52 --> 3873.44
will get on it

3871.28 --> 3874.48
they'll be like oh well okay let's study

3873.44 --> 3876.2400000000002
all that works

3874.48 --> 3879.28
you know let's go through what they

3876.24 --> 3895.839
presented and see what that is

3879.28 --> 3895.8390000000004
and then yeah that will happen again

3899.44 --> 3906.64
the rocket debris okay

3903.28 --> 3910.0
well most rocket debris comes down

3906.64 --> 3914.319
pretty quickly like

3910.0 --> 3918.319
when the rocket's gone over that

3914.319 --> 3920.88
horizontal line and all that

3918.319 --> 3923.839
you know when it goes down again in the

3920.88 --> 3923.839
same trajectory

3968.24 --> 3979.839
and i'm back

4004.839 --> 4007.839
uh

4032.839 --> 4035.839
okay

4037.97 --> 4041.1099999999997
[Music]

4073.599 --> 4080.319
hello raziel i'm i'm going to block you

4077.359 --> 4080.88
if you don't start stop repeating the

4080.319 --> 4083.0389999999998
same

4080.88 --> 4085.039
unproven claim [Â __Â ] over and over

4083.039 --> 4085.92
again because i'm getting kind of sick

4085.039 --> 4088.48
of this oh

4085.92 --> 4090.0
they're already done some where where is

4088.48 --> 4093.28
it then

4090.0 --> 4093.68
no what you read it in an article that

4093.28 --> 4095.8390000000004
just

4093.68 --> 4099.2789999999995
said that happened because you haven't

4095.839 --> 4105.839
provided any evidence of it whatsoever

4099.279 --> 4111.040000000001
so stop yapping about the [Â __Â ]

4105.839 --> 4119.839
on youtube search tianji okay

4111.04 --> 4119.839
at least you're trying

4129.359 --> 4136.0
goody they built a thing

4133.04 --> 4136.4
on earth and there is footage of it wow

4136.0 --> 4147.839
that

4136.4 --> 4147.839
proves it all this is ridiculous

4150.56 --> 4159.1990000000005
you can't seriously expect me to believe

4154.48 --> 4159.199
that it is actually up there i see

4159.52 --> 4163.6
just a couple of frames animation but

4162.88 --> 4168.96
that's

4163.6 --> 4168.96
not real can't be

4172.839 --> 4178.5599999999995
serious

4175.279 --> 4178.56
oh my god like

4181.12 --> 4186.719
this is 100 3d animation all of it

4186.839 --> 4189.839
isn't

4192.239 --> 4200.718999999999
like even the trees is like 2008

4196.32 --> 4206.159
graphics yeah so video is fake no

4200.719 --> 4206.159
[Â __Â ] dude are you [Â __Â ]

4208.719 --> 4212.32
yeah this is the one that came up

4212.4 --> 4219.36
you must be like literally blind

4216.8 --> 4220.08
or very nearsighted or something to

4219.36 --> 4231.839999999999
believe that

4220.08 --> 4231.84
any of that is real

4241.76 --> 4248.8
yeah i posted it so video is fake

4245.199 --> 4252.08
yeah it's [Â __Â ] fake as [Â __Â ]

4248.8 --> 4255.4400000000005
dude look at the freaking trees at the

4252.08 --> 4258.0
launch site like they didn't even

4255.44 --> 4259.28
it's so cookie cutter animation it's

4258.0 --> 4261.6
just pathetic

4259.28 --> 4264.48
dude if you believe that's real you are

4261.6 --> 4267.360000000001
seriously demented

4264.48 --> 4268.799999999999
have you ever has your mom ever let you

4267.36 --> 4270.799999999999
out of the basement

4268.8 --> 4272.08
i mean come on have you actually ever

4270.8 --> 4274.8
seen a real tree

4272.08 --> 4276.32
in the real world have you ever used

4274.8 --> 4279.84
your eyes

4276.32 --> 4281.04
to focus on anything beyond a feat in

4279.84 --> 4286.4800000000005
front of you

4281.04 --> 4288.719
like what the hell is wrong with you man

4286.48 --> 4290.4
oh that clip is an animation but there

4288.719 --> 4293.84
is footage of a lot oh

4290.4 --> 4295.92
so a thing hey you saw a rocket and

4293.84 --> 4298.400000000001
that's your proof

4295.92 --> 4299.679
you're demanded dude that's really

4298.4 --> 4301.839999999999
pathetic

4299.679 --> 4305.36
the link i gave is fake well that's the

4301.84 --> 4305.360000000001
link that actually popped up

4307.6 --> 4312.88
right that's what's popped up that's

4310.719 --> 4315.679
there

4312.88 --> 4316.32
hey you tell me to look for it on

4315.679 --> 4318.96
youtube

4316.32 --> 4320.08
you gave me the words i did that this is

4318.96 --> 4322.8
what popped off

4320.08 --> 4324.48
oh it's fake yeah no [Â __Â ] dude that's

4322.8 --> 4326.84
your tip

4324.48 --> 4329.839999999999
it's what you told me to look for you

4326.84 --> 4329.84
dumbass

4334.88 --> 4340.159000000001
oh that's really nice for you pat fee

4337.36 --> 4342.159
that's cool you saw a penis rocket fly

4340.159 --> 4343.839999999999
in a curve and then splash down

4342.159 --> 4345.759999999999
somewhere outside

4343.84 --> 4347.6
yeah out of sight yeah that's really

4345.76 --> 4349.679
nice that's cool

4347.6 --> 4351.280000000001
rocket balloons and [Â __Â ] yeah it's all

4349.679 --> 4353.1990000000005
very special

4351.28 --> 4355.04
we're in the space age we're special

4353.199 --> 4357.199
boys because we believe

4355.04 --> 4358.88
really dumb [Â __Â ] that is physically

4357.199 --> 4362.08
impossible

4358.88 --> 4362.96
right can't happen there's no low earth

4362.08 --> 4366.88
orbit

4362.96 --> 4368.32
gravity which doesn't actually exist but

4366.88 --> 4370.719
the way portrayed it

4368.32 --> 4372.239
it's supposed to be it doesn't decrease

4370.719 --> 4375.52
over distance

4372.239 --> 4379.36
that's fiction it doesn't happen

4375.52 --> 4385.84
also there's no vacuum up there

4379.36 --> 4387.5199999999995
right it's all [Â __Â ]

4385.84 --> 4390.400000000001
yeah seeking start yeah a launch

4387.52 --> 4394.719
happened yeah you send a rocket

4390.4 --> 4394.719
up somewhere have some people say yeah

4394.8 --> 4398.320000000001
maybe like a control room a couple of

4396.88 --> 4401.679
people like oh

4398.32 --> 4405.28
successful launch oh space

4401.679 --> 4408.4800000000005
it's very special boy right

4405.28 --> 4411.92
and then you yeah you let the animators

4408.48 --> 4413.839999999999
show you the rest through really crappy

4411.92 --> 4416.32
cgi

4413.84 --> 4417.6
or well it might be like halfway decent

4416.32 --> 4420.4
now the cgi

4417.6 --> 4421.360000000001
but it's still like seriously visible

4420.4 --> 4425.44
it's cgi

4421.36 --> 4426.08
it's sub hollywood quality hollywood

4425.44 --> 4429.28
quality

4426.08 --> 4431.199
is a lot higher than everything that i

4429.28 --> 4434.32
saw there

4431.199 --> 4434.32
it's just ridiculous

4438.08 --> 4441.199
is it impossible to build rockets no

4440.0 --> 4443.52
it's not impossible

4441.199 --> 4445.04
it's just impossible to actually send

4443.52 --> 4445.679
them up there and then they're gonna

4445.04 --> 4449.679
stay there

4445.679 --> 4453.36
that's impossible that's sci-fi

4449.679 --> 4455.84
it's a lie doesn't happen they always go

4453.36 --> 4455.839999999999
down

4488.4 --> 4496.48
you guys i feel right now i'm literally

4491.6 --> 4500.56
just wasting my time with you

4496.48 --> 4502.0
just please go fantasy squirting

4500.56 --> 4504.4800000000005
somewhere else is getting really

4502.0 --> 4504.48
annoying

4505.44 --> 4512.48
i'm not gonna look up anything further

4509.36 --> 4515.5199999999995
for you right

4512.48 --> 4516.718999999999
it's obvious what this is i had i had no

4515.52 --> 4520.159000000001
idea that they were

4516.719 --> 4520.159
basically now doing that

4522.239 --> 4526.639999999999
so thank you for reminding me i guess

4524.96 --> 4528.96
that that's happening

4526.64 --> 4530.08
but yeah there's nothing there's not

4528.96 --> 4534.8
gonna be anything

4530.08 --> 4536.84
there couldn't be anything and

4534.8 --> 4538.320000000001
if you keep believing this you're dumb

4536.84 --> 4541.92
ass

4538.32 --> 4545.5199999999995
right this is just stuff

4541.92 --> 4547.36
just like spacex stuff nasa stuff

4545.52 --> 4549.679
and there's a lot of stuff and nothing

4547.36 --> 4552.48
really happens

4549.679 --> 4555.28
just preoccupying you with sci-fi

4552.48 --> 4555.28
imagination

4562.96 --> 4569.12
why build rockets in the first place

4566.27 --> 4572.4800000000005
[Music]

4569.12 --> 4581.84
oh look it's there and

4572.48 --> 4581.839999999999
he's gone

4588.08 --> 4591.76
why build rockets if everything is cgi

4590.96 --> 4593.84
well

4591.76 --> 4596.56
they still want a couple of witnesses at

4593.84 --> 4596.56
ground level

4597.6 --> 4599.84
right

4603.36 --> 4610.0
and hey it's not that expensive

4606.4 --> 4612.96
to take a rocket balloon and do that

4610.0 --> 4614.8
it is like fireworks it's a fireworks

4612.96 --> 4619.92
celebration situation

4614.8 --> 4622.96
and a wizardry spectacle

4619.92 --> 4626.56
it's a trick and hey

4622.96 --> 4626.96
if they've just figured out people will

4626.56 --> 4629.679
be

4626.96 --> 4630.4
quite easily convinced if you just show

4629.679 --> 4632.8
them

4630.4 --> 4634.639999999999
a rocket launch at the start with

4632.8 --> 4636.08
whatever device they're supposed to be

4634.64 --> 4639.280000000001
sending up there

4636.08 --> 4641.76
just do that and then

4639.28 --> 4643.28
take over the rest with imagination and

4641.76 --> 4646.56
because people saw

4643.28 --> 4649.199
actually a physical thing with a lot of

4646.56 --> 4651.84
noise and a lot of fire

4649.199 --> 4653.04
go up into the distance and then

4651.84 --> 4655.92
supposedly

4653.04 --> 4657.6
moving into orbit over the earth and

4655.92 --> 4659.04
then eventually they just move out of

4657.6 --> 4662.159000000001
sight and crash down somewhere

4659.04 --> 4665.04
where but you don't get to see that

4662.159 --> 4665.599999999999
that if yeah if they do it like that

4665.04 --> 4667.76
then

4665.6 --> 4670.56
you can just take over with animations

4667.76 --> 4673.76
and maybe other stage trickery

4670.56 --> 4676.4800000000005
and people will buy it that's why

4673.76 --> 4677.280000000001
they will buy it and when i say buying

4676.48 --> 4680.799999999999
it i mean

4677.28 --> 4684.0
literally spend a lot of money to

4680.8 --> 4684.96
buy it to become part of that because

4684.0 --> 4687.76
they

4684.96 --> 4693.84
foolishly believe it is contributing to

4687.76 --> 4693.84
something other than their own delusion

4703.679 --> 4707.84
so that's why pat fee that's why they

4706.64 --> 4710.400000000001
use rockets

4707.84 --> 4711.52
if most of it is just cgi because they

4710.4 --> 4714.08
have to

4711.52 --> 4717.52
do a physical trick first before they

4714.08 --> 4720.08
can bind you to the screen

4717.52 --> 4723.120000000001
and let the cgi take over they have to

4720.08 --> 4726.64
have some physical thing out there

4723.12 --> 4729.12
they can't just make a cgi rocket launch

4726.64 --> 4730.320000000001
because the people that would be in such

4729.12 --> 4733.5199999999995
a

4730.32 --> 4736.159
studio setup they would

4733.52 --> 4737.360000000001
not seem real like they like to use

4736.159 --> 4739.679
people that really

4737.36 --> 4740.5599999999995
believe that sort of [Â __Â ] in those

4739.679 --> 4742.64
locations

4740.56 --> 4744.96
to film them as they are actually

4742.64 --> 4747.12
responding to really believing it

4744.96 --> 4748.88
because it's a more genuine reaction

4747.12 --> 4751.92
it's more encouraging

4748.88 --> 4753.6
to the illusion for others that watch

4751.92 --> 4756.4800000000005
that

4753.6 --> 4757.92
right they want some fragment of actual

4756.48 --> 4762.32
belief in there they can't just

4757.92 --> 4764.32
cgi everything because then

4762.32 --> 4777.84
who is it gonna appeal to there's no

4764.32 --> 4777.84
spark of realness in it anymore then

4786.8 --> 4791.84
i don't care brazil i really don't

4806.719 --> 4813.92
that sounds like the gayest most gamma

4810.159 --> 4819.839999999999
reality show imaginable

4813.92 --> 4819.84
that's uh

4828.43 --> 4831.479
[Music]

4844.84 --> 4847.84
hmm

4862.48 --> 4875.839999999999
all right

4882.8 --> 4888.4800000000005
all right yeah

4886.08 --> 4890.5599999999995
figured it out i can mute my desktop

4888.48 --> 4892.718999999999
audio

4890.56 --> 4894.2390000000005
then you won't get any stupid clicking

4892.719 --> 4896.639
sounds or whatever

4894.239 --> 4898.799999999999
from games or things that i'm checking

4896.639 --> 4903.84
out when i'm browsing

4898.8 --> 4903.84
should remember that

4913.199 --> 4919.199
a chance to note oh piss off brazil

4916.719 --> 4919.199
please

4923.36 --> 4931.04
what the chance to know the truth

4926.719 --> 4931.04
what to become part of this stupid

4942.84 --> 4945.84
clownery

4948.96 --> 4954.4
japanese guy offered two lucky

4951.04 --> 4958.32
individuals to travel to space

4954.4 --> 4960.719
yeah and they probably got a trip

4958.32 --> 4962.48
in low earth orbit as they call it like

4960.719 --> 4965.679
a long

4962.48 --> 4967.04
journey right you can't have that it's

4965.679 --> 4970.96
not going to be

4967.04 --> 4972.8
actual orbiting it's just going to be a

4970.96 --> 4975.92
long journey

4972.8 --> 4979.52
like that is possible right for whatever

4975.92 --> 4980.08
everybody's saying suppose it's space

4979.52 --> 4984.719
travel

4980.08 --> 4987.84
yeah you can have a ride

4984.719 --> 4988.719
way up there that is very similar to

4987.84 --> 4991.92
what we would

4988.719 --> 4995.12
expect it to be like

4991.92 --> 4995.6
to be in orbit right you could probably

4995.12 --> 4999.679
have

4995.6 --> 5003.360000000001
a ride to do that

4999.679 --> 5006.0
right because there's no point where the

5003.36 --> 5008.0
supposed gravity actually ends it just

5006.0 --> 5011.44
continues on

5008.0 --> 5015.84
no matter how high you are but you could

5011.44 --> 5015.839999999999
basically go in a trajectory

5015.92 --> 5020.88
where yeah you can stay up there

5018.96 --> 5022.719
i don't know maybe for like an hour or

5020.88 --> 5024.32
something i don't know it depends on the

5022.719 --> 5027.199
trajectory

5024.32 --> 5027.599999999999
right some booster support yeah you

5027.199 --> 5029.678999999999
could

5027.6 --> 5031.4400000000005
it's basically like a super high

5029.679 --> 5034.96
altitude plane that goes

5031.44 --> 5035.839999999999
like in an arc and then you could even

5034.96 --> 5038.0
have a period where

5035.84 --> 5038.96
you're gonna have lesser gravity because

5038.0 --> 5043.44
it's going to be

5038.96 --> 5047.84
slowly falling or something

5043.44 --> 5051.599999999999
like diagonally a bit of a dive

5047.84 --> 5051.6
to neutralize like virgin flight

5052.0 --> 5056.4
like the thing is that is a possibility

5055.44 --> 5058.4
in the physical

5056.4 --> 5059.759999999999
real world that is something that can

5058.4 --> 5063.28
actually be done

5059.76 --> 5064.0
anything other than that though staying

5063.28 --> 5066.96
up there

5064.0 --> 5070.159
for days absolutely impossible unless

5066.96 --> 5072.96
you are suspended by a balloon

5070.159 --> 5073.36
big zeppelin and it couldn't go up that

5072.96 --> 5075.28
high

5073.36 --> 5076.639
and you would definitely notice yeah

5075.28 --> 5078.32
still gravity

5076.639 --> 5080.4800000000005
or whatever you're going to think it is

5078.32 --> 5083.12
still you're still going to be

5080.48 --> 5086.159
pulled in the stationary situation

5083.12 --> 5089.84
situation up there

5086.159 --> 5093.12
so yeah you can go up there

5089.84 --> 5094.159000000001
it's just no space and there's no low

5093.12 --> 5099.28
earth orbit

5094.159 --> 5101.599999999999
and there's no

5099.28 --> 5104.0
yeah no missing gravity that doesn't

5101.6 --> 5104.0
exist

5105.6 --> 5112.08
right so yeah sure two lucky guys got a

5108.639 --> 5113.28
special special trip through space and

5112.08 --> 5114.719
they probably went through the

5113.28 --> 5116.8
trajectory if it ever

5114.719 --> 5119.44
actually happened i don't know but could

5116.8 --> 5121.52
happen it's a kind of silly thing to do

5119.44 --> 5123.28
maybe a stunt maybe a space stunt maybe

5121.52 --> 5125.6
the guy was real big fan

5123.28 --> 5127.679
or he's like into aeronautics industry

5125.6 --> 5131.360000000001
and he needs to do that to kind of

5127.679 --> 5132.719
advertise for that industry

5131.36 --> 5134.719
something like that wouldn't be

5132.719 --> 5137.44
unexpected at all right

5134.719 --> 5137.92
there is no space there's no actual

5137.44 --> 5141.839999999999
orbit

5137.92 --> 5141.84
it's a stunt

5155.36 --> 5160.32
space hotel orbiting is

5158.48 --> 5162.48
i've heard those rumors too it's

5160.32 --> 5164.639
hilarious

5162.48 --> 5164.638999999999
like

5165.6 --> 5170.159000000001
i think like russia tried to emulate

5168.96 --> 5171.84
that at some point

5170.159 --> 5175.759999999999
it was kind of weird i thought like oh

5171.84 --> 5178.4800000000005
is that real but i think it was

5175.76 --> 5179.280000000001
some piece of trickery when i said saw

5178.48 --> 5182.5599999999995
that

5179.28 --> 5184.8
but yeah there supposedly might be

5182.56 --> 5186.2390000000005
some there's a claim of a hotel

5184.8 --> 5189.4400000000005
somewhere up there

5186.239 --> 5189.44
it's just bizarre

5191.199 --> 5198.4
but you know realistically

5196.32 --> 5199.599999999999
who knows you might have something

5198.4 --> 5202.799999999999
actually like that

5199.6 --> 5204.4800000000005
even on a flat earth right even in the

5202.8 --> 5206.88
real physical world

5204.48 --> 5207.599999999999
you might have like an the possibility

5206.88 --> 5211.36
to build an

5207.6 --> 5214.639
air palace it's really

5211.36 --> 5218.48
bizarre and would probably

5214.639 --> 5221.679
not yeah would probably be a waste

5218.48 --> 5222.839999999999
but hey who knows you could probably

5221.679 --> 5226.88
have some kind of

5222.84 --> 5228.56
levitating station

5226.88 --> 5231.92
that would be kind of expensive it would

5228.56 --> 5234.56
be like made extremely light

5231.92 --> 5235.4400000000005
it would be like a luxurious zeppelin

5234.56 --> 5237.84
almost

5235.44 --> 5239.599999999999
but probably yeah not shaped like that

5237.84 --> 5242.159000000001
and who knows what other

5239.6 --> 5243.84
technology electrostatic influencing

5242.159 --> 5247.04
technologies they got by now

5243.84 --> 5248.400000000001
to make that kind of doable so that it

5247.04 --> 5250.56
could be like a

5248.4 --> 5252.879999999999
a fortress that could just go up and

5250.56 --> 5254.96
float there for a very long time until

5252.88 --> 5257.36
it has to come down again

5254.96 --> 5258.8
stock up on some stuff and then go up

5257.36 --> 5261.28
again

5258.8 --> 5264.0
like a balloon that goes up extremely

5261.28 --> 5267.199
high who knows that is possible

5264.0 --> 5269.199
it wouldn't be staying up there forever

5267.199 --> 5271.678999999999
because there's yeah what goes up must

5269.199 --> 5271.678999999999
come down

5271.92 --> 5278.4
all right space city i saw it in my

5275.52 --> 5281.84
vision a long time ago this thing

5278.4 --> 5282.638999999999
space city like that could actually be

5281.84 --> 5285.04
real

5282.639 --> 5286.0
it's kind of silly though why would you

5285.04 --> 5289.04
do that

5286.0 --> 5292.48
except to show off luxury like

5289.04 --> 5294.4
how insanely wealthy you are and how

5292.48 --> 5295.199
much you don't care about the earthly

5294.4 --> 5298.0
problems

5295.199 --> 5300.4
right it would be exceptionally symbolic

5298.0 --> 5300.4
to that

5302.239 --> 5308.08
how could it float well how does a

5304.159 --> 5311.199
zeppelin float

5308.08 --> 5311.199
any tech dude

5311.6 --> 5316.320000000001
yeah it's oh oops i shouldn't be talking

5315.6 --> 5319.280000000001
about this

5316.32 --> 5321.759999999999
this is actually secret classified stuff

5319.28 --> 5325.04
of what they have been planning

5321.76 --> 5337.84
through the cia for decades oops

5325.04 --> 5337.84
shouldn't be talking about this um

5344.239 --> 5350.799999999999
what happened to your vision well

5347.36 --> 5353.44
i saw it i saw space city

5350.8 --> 5353.4400000000005
walked in it

5356.32 --> 5359.199
it was up there

5359.36 --> 5365.839999999999
in the real world

5367.44 --> 5371.199
oh yeah and when you look down the earth

5369.28 --> 5374.4
did not look like a ball at all

5371.199 --> 5374.4
it looked like a disc

5375.52 --> 5379.360000000001
and in retrospect it's because of the

5377.44 --> 5382.159
edge of vision because the disc

5379.36 --> 5383.839999999999
did not contain the continents as

5382.159 --> 5387.5199999999995
expected it was just

5383.84 --> 5391.28
a disc with black outside of that disc

5387.52 --> 5394.400000000001
and it didn't contain the continents

5391.28 --> 5395.599999999999
it was literally the edge of sight that

5394.4 --> 5399.28
just limited

5395.6 --> 5402.2390000000005
me to see further beyond that visible

5399.28 --> 5402.239
disk of earth

5403.92 --> 5408.4
even though guaranteed to have been more

5406.48 --> 5410.718999999999
there would have been more beyond that

5408.4 --> 5410.719
side

5417.52 --> 5423.1990000000005
space no it it's the name

5420.56 --> 5425.04
space city it's like that's the the

5423.199 --> 5426.879999999999
dream

5425.04 --> 5428.88
it's the name they like now of course

5426.88 --> 5431.1990000000005
space is fake

5428.88 --> 5434.08
like even in that vision that was sort

5431.199 --> 5435.919999999999
of revealed

5434.08 --> 5437.28
it doesn't mean that it can't be called

5435.92 --> 5439.52
space city

5437.28 --> 5441.12
i called it space city i never got like

5439.52 --> 5443.120000000001
a name

5441.12 --> 5444.32
it's just like that's the impression i

5443.12 --> 5446.639
got

5444.32 --> 5449.84
like whoa this is like a space city some

5446.639 --> 5449.84
floating thing

5452.08 --> 5454.5599999999995
that's it

5457.84 --> 5463.76
right but as i joked before this

5462.239 --> 5467.599999999999
classified information

5463.76 --> 5467.6
shouldn't be talking about that future

5469.56 --> 5472.719
[Music]

5474.84 --> 5479.52
project

5476.08 --> 5482.639
yeah is anybody still left in here or

5479.52 --> 5484.8
are the trolls just nagging you all away

5482.639 --> 5491.84
because i'm getting a little bit tired

5484.8 --> 5491.84
from brazil and pat five here

5493.6 --> 5498.400000000001
what's the highest an altitude altitude

5495.92 --> 5504.08
an aircraft can reach

5498.4 --> 5507.36
i don't know steamy traveler

5504.08 --> 5507.36
drawings of my vision

5509.84 --> 5515.679
could be a cool video game

5513.199 --> 5516.48
made draw well draw i did kind of like

5515.679 --> 5518.88
model out

5516.48 --> 5520.0
because i even got like a side on view

5518.88 --> 5523.6
of the whole thing like

5520.0 --> 5525.76
it was presented as a holographic

5523.6 --> 5528.159000000001
projection within the dark world which

5525.76 --> 5532.4800000000005
is like a holodeck

5528.159 --> 5535.04
so eventually i got an outside view

5532.48 --> 5536.718999999999
i had i did make a drawing of that it's

5535.04 --> 5547.84
been a while

5536.719 --> 5547.84
let me try and find that back

5551.36 --> 5558.239
hope i'm not turning into ranty to

5554.4 --> 5559.12
are you dude you're getting a timeout

5558.239 --> 5562.638999999999
for that that's

5559.12 --> 5562.639
just a personal insult

5563.36 --> 5566.88
take five pat five

5573.199 --> 5578.4
where is it oh yeah

5587.04 --> 5591.04
it is kind of yeah this is not exactly

5590.4 --> 5596.239
what

5591.04 --> 5596.239
it looked like this is yeah

5598.48 --> 5602.718999999999
it's a drawing that definitely requires

5600.56 --> 5605.92
some explanation

5602.719 --> 5608.88
i've shown this before anyway let me

5605.92 --> 5608.88
see if i can get it

5615.6 --> 5618.320000000001
to birth

5619.84 --> 5631.84
oh okay

5637.36 --> 5639.839999999999
let's see

5642.639 --> 5646.2390000000005
right so this thing

5652.159 --> 5659.839999999999
i made this drawing a long time ago

5655.76 --> 5659.84
what is this

5663.12 --> 5673.84
last edited whoa

5666.44 --> 5673.839999999999
2016 december 3rd

5684.56 --> 5689.1990000000005
so yeah there's space city floating on

5686.639 --> 5689.1990000000005
top of it

5693.6 --> 5696.639
above the dome well because it's not a

5696.239 --> 5699.839999999999
dome

5696.639 --> 5702.96
razio it's not a dome

5699.84 --> 5704.96
it's the globe of the heavens it's the

5702.96 --> 5707.679
stars

5704.96 --> 5709.04
right this is a personal perspective

5707.679 --> 5711.76
view

5709.04 --> 5712.4
scaled out like massively scaled out and

5711.76 --> 5714.400000000001
then

5712.4 --> 5717.119
seen from a first person perspective a

5714.4 --> 5719.28
third person perspective

5717.119 --> 5721.199
the globe of the heavens like the earth

5719.28 --> 5723.199
underneath it

5721.199 --> 5724.239
is flexible right that's why there is

5723.199 --> 5727.119
literally a

5724.239 --> 5727.599999999999
circle like a limit to sight but even in

5727.119 --> 5730.719
here

5727.6 --> 5734.719
i kind of like show what is beyond

5730.719 --> 5738.0
by the other realms beyond it

5734.719 --> 5740.4800000000005
right but that dome

5738.0 --> 5741.76
is not really a dome it's the globe of

5740.48 --> 5744.799999999999
the heavens

5741.76 --> 5746.2390000000005
it's the visual which makes it a bit odd

5744.8 --> 5749.84
that the

5746.239 --> 5756.239
the space station thing space city

5749.84 --> 5759.679
is up there

5756.239 --> 5761.44
this is like this is not a a model

5759.679 --> 5763.92
drawing this

5761.44 --> 5765.44
well it is model based but it basically

5763.92 --> 5771.84
took some artistic

5765.44 --> 5771.839999999999
liberty to do this

5774.88 --> 5778.56
[Â __Â ] like a dome yeah but i just already

5777.76 --> 5781.119000000001
told you

5778.56 --> 5783.1990000000005
what it actually is you can also see on

5781.119 --> 5786.639
the inside of it

5783.199 --> 5788.879999999999
right moon stars

5786.639 --> 5788.88
sun

5789.84 --> 5796.08
it is that dome so the dome is not a

5793.36 --> 5799.599999999999
physical gas pressure container

5796.08 --> 5801.6
in this in this visual it's

5799.6 --> 5804.159000000001
the globe of the heavens surrounding the

5801.6 --> 5804.159000000001
observer

5810.96 --> 5817.44
globe of the heavens the stars

5814.159 --> 5821.119
the moon the sun the planets

5817.44 --> 5823.04
all the celestial lights are holographic

5821.119 --> 5824.4
they are at the edge of your vision like

5823.04 --> 5828.48
a demisphere and

5824.4 --> 5830.32
follow you around and rotate accordingly

5828.48 --> 5832.0
to the cyclical patterns and the

5830.32 --> 5836.88
position on earth

5832.0 --> 5838.88
in very specific cyclical systems

5836.88 --> 5840.08
right and it's holographic it's always

5838.88 --> 5842.08
at the edge of vision

5840.08 --> 5843.6
none of the celestial lights including

5842.08 --> 5846.719
the sun and the moon

5843.6 --> 5850.4800000000005
none of them have actual positions

5846.719 --> 5851.04
physical literal positions or origin

5850.48 --> 5854.718999999999
point

5851.04 --> 5857.679
of that literal light they don't have a

5854.719 --> 5860.0
literal origin point of light

5857.679 --> 5861.76
it's like manifest because it's

5860.0 --> 5862.32
holographic and it's at the edge of

5861.76 --> 5864.8
vision

5862.32 --> 5869.84
and that is what the dome in this

5864.8 --> 5869.84
picture represents

5880.84 --> 5886.159000000001
2006.

5882.48 --> 5888.959999999999
just saying hey eagle planet anchor

5886.159 --> 5888.96
michael o'rourke

5894.08 --> 5897.92
uh i at noon the sun is not at the edge

5897.52 --> 5901.4400000000005
of

5897.92 --> 5906.719
vision in anybody's eyes

5901.44 --> 5910.5599999999995
what is noon yeah the apparition

5906.719 --> 5913.76
of the sun that apparent bright disc

5910.56 --> 5914.56
we see yeah it is at the edge of vision

5913.76 --> 5917.6
it's always

5914.56 --> 5918.88
at the edge of vision it's always in the

5917.6 --> 5921.52
demi globe

5918.88 --> 5923.28
surrounding you on the spherical

5921.52 --> 5925.52
trajectory all of it is

5923.28 --> 5927.36
on spherical trajectories at the edge of

5925.52 --> 5930.159000000001
vision

5927.36 --> 5932.08
not anything further not anything closer

5930.159 --> 5934.96
it's always there at that

5932.08 --> 5936.84
apparent distance not actual distance

5934.96 --> 5939.84
apparent distance because it's all

5936.84 --> 5939.84
holographic

5953.52 --> 5959.84
yeah it's just appearances

5956.719 --> 5963.36
the lights including the sun

5959.84 --> 5966.56
it's not a lamp at any distance

5963.36 --> 5969.44
any literal distance no because if it

5966.56 --> 5971.52
was millions and millions of miles away

5969.44 --> 5972.799999999999
you wouldn't be able to see it in for

5971.52 --> 5974.8
square law

5972.8 --> 5977.92
like you wouldn't be able to see stars

5974.8 --> 5980.2390000000005
that would be impossible

5977.92 --> 5981.28
it's too far away that's not actually

5980.239 --> 5984.08
how light works

5981.28 --> 5985.28
so why we see this because it is

5984.08 --> 5988.48
specifically

5985.28 --> 5990.32
like this holographic a demisphere at

5988.48 --> 5993.28
the edge of our vision

5990.32 --> 5993.759999999999
a side effect of sight itself inherently

5993.28 --> 5997.36
built

5993.76 --> 5999.280000000001
into how this realm works it's a part of

5997.36 --> 6001.839999999999
the design but it is different

5999.28 --> 6002.8
it's different light it's not the type

6001.84 --> 6005.360000000001
of light that we

6002.8 --> 6009.84
make here on earth with electricity or

6005.36 --> 6009.839999999999
with fire

6010.0 --> 6015.44
it's holographic light it's inherent to

6012.88 --> 6017.52
sight it's a side effect

6015.44 --> 6020.5599999999995
of the realm it's light manifest it

6017.52 --> 6023.52
doesn't actually come from anywhere

6020.56 --> 6024.88
it just appears to come from somewhere

6023.52 --> 6027.92
specific

6024.88 --> 6030.8
the light does arrive though that

6027.92 --> 6030.8
we can prove

6035.28 --> 6037.84
right anyway

6038.56 --> 6045.679
it's good to see that old drawing again

6042.88 --> 6046.400000000001
did you notice that i actually the land

6045.679 --> 6049.4400000000005
below it

6046.4 --> 6051.839999999999
is supposedly the realm beyond

6049.44 --> 6051.839999999999
the south

6052.96 --> 6057.36
there was a three realm system with like

6055.28 --> 6064.41
a mysterious fourth realm

6057.36 --> 6067.589999999999
further down the north

6064.41 --> 6067.59
[Music]

6073.06 --> 6081.9800000000005
[Music]

6094.8 --> 6098.8
is the sun a hologram yes yes conspiracy

6098.0 --> 6100.719
cats

6098.8 --> 6103.04
why don't you make a special boy video

6100.719 --> 6106.159
about it about how irwin says

6103.04 --> 6109.28
the sun is a hollow hologram

6106.159 --> 6112.159
the sun is a hologram

6109.28 --> 6114.4
it is and so is the moon yeah it's a

6112.159 --> 6116.0
hologram it's not actually a literal

6114.4 --> 6120.239
object you're seeing

6116.0 --> 6123.28
it's not an object it's a hologram

6120.239 --> 6123.919999999999
it's not really anywhere in any specific

6123.28 --> 6127.44
position

6123.92 --> 6131.1990000000005
it just seems like it is

6127.44 --> 6132.4
at a position due to psychological

6131.199 --> 6135.36
effects of

6132.4 --> 6137.119
well how we typically interpret things

6135.36 --> 6140.48
our mind likes to size up

6137.119 --> 6141.5199999999995
and estimate a position in a physical

6140.48 --> 6144.48
world because that's

6141.52 --> 6146.96
what people deal with and life deals

6144.48 --> 6150.08
with with things in the physical world

6146.96 --> 6153.84
so our minds make it

6150.08 --> 6155.76
physical to us because

6153.84 --> 6158.2390000000005
what else is it right how else does the

6155.76 --> 6160.719
mind interpret it well

6158.239 --> 6161.839999999999
if you get real with it you're gonna go

6160.719 --> 6165.52
you're gonna maneuver

6161.84 --> 6166.88
outside of typical life comfort zone

6165.52 --> 6168.639
right you're gonna have to move away

6166.88 --> 6170.8
from physicality assumption bias and

6168.639 --> 6174.2390000000005
that's very tough on a lot of people

6170.8 --> 6176.56
it's weird to think like that

6174.239 --> 6177.36
and to realize there are these elements

6176.56 --> 6180.719
that are just

6177.36 --> 6191.839999999999
not physically literal right we're so

6180.719 --> 6191.84
used to that

6192.56 --> 6196.159000000001
right celestial light versus terrestrial

6195.44 --> 6198.5599999999995
light abs

6196.159 --> 6199.5199999999995
absolutely terrestrial light is all the

6198.56 --> 6202.719
man-made light

6199.52 --> 6206.8
fire light electric lamp

6202.719 --> 6208.0
light gas light all kinds of forms of

6206.8 --> 6211.6
light that we can make

6208.0 --> 6214.56
local light and celestial light is

6211.6 --> 6214.88
everything of the heavens everything we

6214.56 --> 6219.84
see

6214.88 --> 6219.84
up there if there's no clouds in between

6220.8 --> 6233.84
and they're not the same they're

6222.4 --> 6233.839999999999
fundamentally different

6255.28 --> 6262.5599999999995
ah look at them

6259.199 --> 6263.44
see i this is so typical of globals i

6262.56 --> 6265.76
literally

6263.44 --> 6267.119
tried to figure out how things work that

6265.76 --> 6269.6
i've observed

6267.119 --> 6270.88
share my conclusions you guys get it

6269.6 --> 6273.6
right

6270.88 --> 6274.0
the the people that have been following

6273.6 --> 6277.52
me for

6274.0 --> 6280.88
a while reading with me

6277.52 --> 6281.52
hearing me out trying to explain all

6280.88 --> 6284.159000000001
this

6281.52 --> 6284.88
in a way that's comprehensible they

6284.159 --> 6288.96
however

6284.88 --> 6292.88
just listen to it and then say oh but

6288.96 --> 6293.679
that's not in any of the literature that

6292.88 --> 6296.88
we are

6293.679 --> 6299.28
bound by by our globe faith

6296.88 --> 6300.639
it's so far outside of us outrageous so

6299.28 --> 6303.759999999999
this is crazy

6300.639 --> 6307.04
oh crazy that's

6303.76 --> 6309.6
that's conspiracy cat's response that's

6307.04 --> 6311.679
pat v's response that's raziel's

6309.6 --> 6314.88
response

6311.679 --> 6317.28
tiny womble knows better than that

6314.88 --> 6320.159000000001
right but they're just like wow this is

6317.28 --> 6321.119
so far outside of what is written about

6320.159 --> 6324.239
everywhere

6321.119 --> 6327.92
it must be crazy they don't even

6324.239 --> 6331.28
actually attempt to get

6327.92 --> 6334.719
into what i'm saying to really try to

6331.28 --> 6337.92
attune to it to imagine it like that

6334.719 --> 6339.04
they have they have no grip on it they

6337.92 --> 6341.84
can't touch it

6339.04 --> 6341.84
can't touch this

6343.28 --> 6348.159
so it's just crazy to you oh you believe

6346.0 --> 6349.76
me yeah yeah sure yeah yeah i know that

6348.159 --> 6352.4
game i know how that works

6349.76 --> 6353.52
yeah you believe i believe it's real now

6352.4 --> 6357.199
you just

6353.52 --> 6358.159000000001
don't have the faculties to figure out

6357.199 --> 6361.919999999999
what i'm saying

6358.159 --> 6366.879999999999
because you're bound to

6361.92 --> 6371.679
your belief-based literature

6366.88 --> 6374.8
right you're bound to paper

6371.679 --> 6375.6
you you don't have the freedom to figure

6374.8 --> 6387.1990000000005
it out

6375.6 --> 6388.88
you don't

6387.199 --> 6390.96
are you asked about everyday

6388.88 --> 6392.88
observations done by millions of people

6390.96 --> 6395.92
yeah and i'm addressing

6392.88 --> 6399.36
celestial observations that all people

6395.92 --> 6402.719
that exist all of them

6399.36 --> 6405.04
get to see every day

6402.719 --> 6406.32
probably yeah every day because the sun

6405.04 --> 6409.76
is part of it too

6406.32 --> 6413.5199999999995
all people in the world ever that ever

6409.76 --> 6416.159000000001
existed have all seen and observed the

6413.52 --> 6421.040000000001
celestial lights all of them

6416.159 --> 6421.04
no exception all of them have seen it

6423.92 --> 6430.32
everybody's seen a moon the stars

6427.52 --> 6431.84
the sun there's no way that you haven't

6430.32 --> 6433.679
seen it it's impossible

6431.84 --> 6436.400000000001
everybody has seen it right so i'm

6433.679 --> 6438.4800000000005
talking about that

6436.4 --> 6440.08
what is the actual experience of seeing

6438.48 --> 6442.879999999999
it how does it work

6440.08 --> 6445.28
how do we figure out what it is that's

6442.88 --> 6447.36
what i've been doing from scratch

6445.28 --> 6449.92
throwing away all pre-assumptions and

6447.36 --> 6453.199
all supposed

6449.92 --> 6456.4800000000005
special boy calculations and

6453.199 --> 6458.32
standardized and just

6456.48 --> 6460.959999999999
figure it out from scratch it's what

6458.32 --> 6460.96
i've been doing

6462.32 --> 6466.799999999999
who made the hologram god made the

6465.36 --> 6472.239
hologram

6466.8 --> 6472.2390000000005
the design it is the design

6473.92 --> 6479.76
the designer made it inherent

6476.96 --> 6480.159
it is here in this realm it's a standard

6479.76 --> 6482.4800000000005
thing

6480.159 --> 6483.28
that happens in this realm if you have

6482.48 --> 6499.839999999999
sight

6483.28 --> 6499.84
you will pick up on the celestials

6504.239 --> 6509.28
nathan shut up conspiracy catch your

6510.84 --> 6518.2390000000005
[Â __Â ]

6512.719 --> 6520.639
dude shut the [Â __Â ] up

6518.239 --> 6527.839999999999
nathan is not gonna go on your petty

6520.639 --> 6527.84
shitty little channel buddy

6538.84 --> 6541.84
coward

6546.96 --> 6554.719
the design approach isn't that

6550.0 --> 6556.48
app wazzy way dude

6554.719 --> 6558.88
the [Â __Â ] all right that's not even

6556.48 --> 6558.879999999999
normal

6566.88 --> 6574.0
did i can't even read that out

6570.639 --> 6576.8
so broken yeah the design

6574.0 --> 6577.76
the design it is all designed this

6576.8 --> 6581.84
existence

6577.76 --> 6584.88
material matter

6581.84 --> 6587.92
exists because it was

6584.88 --> 6590.639
designed all things

6587.92 --> 6591.52
that we experience here in this 3d realm

6590.639 --> 6595.119
are part

6591.52 --> 6598.88
of a design from beginning to end

6595.119 --> 6601.44
the creator did it he made it

6598.88 --> 6603.28
from beginning to end from full

6601.44 --> 6607.36
perfection glory

6603.28 --> 6611.28
to the most wore out entropy

6607.36 --> 6612.5599999999995
end result it's designed every aspect of

6611.28 --> 6614.96
it is designed

6612.56 --> 6616.639
it's all put together to work exactly

6614.96 --> 6620.2390000000005
the way it does

6616.639 --> 6621.36
very fine-tuned very unique with so many

6620.239 --> 6625.598999999999
things to discover

6621.36 --> 6628.839999999999
within the design and it's there

6625.599 --> 6632.08
and it stays the way it is because it is

6628.84 --> 6635.28
designed that way

6632.08 --> 6637.199
and that's a fact right so thanks

6635.28 --> 6638.88
everyone for coming i hope you liked

6637.199 --> 6642.08

weekend

6654.48 --> 6658.879999999999
and please also do support me through

6656.8 --> 6661.04
the paypal patreon crypto wallet super

6658.88 --> 6666.32
chat and membership system join button

6661.04 --> 6669.199
that'll be much appreciated

6666.32 --> 6671.119
why did god make idiots well to test our

6669.199 --> 6676.4
patients that's why

6671.119 --> 6676.4
because yeah

6678.0 --> 6681.44
how would you know you're brilliant if

6680.08 --> 6683.92
you don't have somebody that's

6681.44 --> 6685.119
unbelievably [Â __Â ] stupid to compare

6683.92 --> 6688.2390000000005
yourself with

6685.119 --> 6691.5199999999995
how would you know you would be smart

6688.239 --> 6695.598999999999
if it weren't for somebody really stupid

6691.52 --> 6698.639
right that's why they made you ballers

6695.599 --> 6700.2390000000005
anyway uh i'm gonna join the flat earth

6698.639 --> 6702.04
debates right after this i'll be back

6700.239 --> 6703.199
tomorrow flat earth early bird number

6702.04 --> 6706.8
884

6703.199 --> 6707.678999999999
on the wednesday and until the next

6706.8 --> 6723.84
video

6707.679 --> 6723.84
keep it flat

6724.37 --> 6742.04
