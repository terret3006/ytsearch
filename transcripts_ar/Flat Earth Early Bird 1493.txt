so please keep the support coming

99.18 --> 102.54
right anyway the weather turned around a

101.759 --> 105.18
bit

102.54 --> 110.60000000000001
it's actually kind of nice and sunny

105.18 --> 110.60000000000001
most of the time this last hour at least

111.299 --> 117.259
seems like there's so many clouds going

114.0 --> 117.259
in front of the sun right now

117.36 --> 122.159
but yeah the there's a lot of clouds up

120.119 --> 123.6
there moving they're not super thick or

122.159 --> 125.78
anything there's no rain coming out of

123.6 --> 125.78
them

126.06 --> 133.879
still very little wind down down here

130.86 --> 133.87900000000002
but still some

134.98 --> 138.54
[Music]

136.2 --> 141.78
and yeah those bits of sun were really

138.54 --> 144.2
nice not very warm but still very

141.78 --> 144.2
pleasant

144.42 --> 151.379
woke up again this morning

147.599 --> 153.48
with Rays from the Sun coming in my face

151.379 --> 155.57999999999998
which happens at a

153.48 --> 158.22
typical time

155.58 --> 159.9
mostly around when I when I have my

158.22 --> 161.519
alarm clock going so that's kind of

159.9 --> 163.86
funny how that works out

161.519 --> 167.28
if there's some it will actually shine

163.86 --> 169.26000000000002
in my face then through that angle isn't

167.28 --> 171.959
that just interesting

169.26 --> 175.62
right uh

171.959 --> 179.28
so I got my own Sundial alarm side clock

175.62 --> 182.28
but it only works if the Sun is out

179.28 --> 186.86
anyway hello Luna loves you first in

182.28 --> 186.86
chat Matthew Eastman good to see you

187.62 --> 197.36
and for more beautiful mofo okay

192.0 --> 197.36
all right Eden anyway good to see you

201.3 --> 208.44
this Thursday the 26th of January 2023

215.76 --> 221.28
relatively late night last night I've

219.599 --> 223.5
completely lost track of time kind of

221.28 --> 224.76
like I did on my show too

223.5 --> 228.379
uh

224.76 --> 228.379
but I still feel pretty good

228.72 --> 232.28
did sleep pretty well

232.86 --> 235.81900000000002
had a shower

237.84 --> 242.599
last evening

240.12 --> 242.59900000000002
night

245.64 --> 248.72
I feel pretty good

248.879 --> 254.72
decent dinner oh yeah I had one beer but

251.879 --> 254.72
like

255.42 --> 260.459
yeah that that didn't do much but yeah I

258.419 --> 262.85999999999996
did do something

260.459 --> 265.02
but I mean it's yeah

262.86 --> 266.52000000000004
I felt like it I wanted to check it out

265.02 --> 269.69899999999996
and

266.52 --> 273.919
I just had one and like

269.699 --> 273.91900000000004
after that it was kind of saturated

273.96 --> 279.53999999999996
and I had a pizza

276.12 --> 282.08
pretty much as lunch again with all the

279.54 --> 285.8
peppers and everything and the pepperoni

282.08 --> 285.8
that was delicious

290.46 --> 294.06
perhaps you will partake in Illuminati

293.04 --> 297.6
Castle

294.06 --> 300.6
well no not really Matthew Eastman I've

297.6 --> 303.12
I had some bizarre responses to that

300.6 --> 307.04
where I just didn't really feel good

303.12 --> 307.04
after having eaten it

307.44 --> 315.24
and they're kind of expensive relatively

313.08 --> 317.65999999999997
I mean it's a really good snack but

315.24 --> 317.66
still

318.96 --> 322.28
I can't afford it

323.82 --> 328.52
all right anyway hello flutter Sage good

326.16 --> 328.52000000000004
to see you

329.639 --> 334.259
I mean if you guys support me a little

332.22 --> 336.6
more then yeah maybe I'll get an

334.259 --> 339.5
Illuminati Castle

336.6 --> 339.5
but uh

340.139 --> 345.24
yeah I mean

341.94 --> 347.71999999999997
last two days have been very

345.24 --> 347.72
tight

349.02 --> 353.479
support wise so yeah

354.55 --> 361.16
[Music]

357.36 --> 361.16
I'm just going with my minty

363.06 --> 366.5
and it's all working out

366.78 --> 369.82
[Music]

373.62 --> 378.419
right didn't have anything on the agenda

375.9 --> 381.419
hence nothing in the title just yet but

378.419 --> 385.15999999999997
that might come afterward

381.419 --> 385.15999999999997
if we get something rolling

386.819 --> 390.66
right

388.5 --> 392.699
so unless you guys want to bring up some

390.66 --> 395.36
subject I'm gonna look through what I've

392.699 --> 395.36
been doing yesterday

400.01 --> 405.06
[Music]

401.699 --> 408.41900000000004
watching Alex Jones a bit

405.06 --> 411.36
it's all kinds of hype

408.419 --> 413.12
about war with Russia which apparently

411.36 --> 415.62
is happening in

413.12 --> 418.68
allegedly what I heard through Alex

415.62 --> 420.3
Jones I I don't know if anything's

418.68 --> 423.90000000000003
actually going to happen with that that

420.3 --> 426.66
supposedly Germany is sending in tanks

423.9 --> 428.4
and they're gonna use like depleted

426.66 --> 431.88000000000005
uranium

428.4 --> 437.29999999999995
okay that's pretty [Â __Â ] up

431.88 --> 437.3
and Russia was well responded to that

437.759 --> 442.56
typical fashion

440.819 --> 445.08000000000004
so we'll see if anything actually

442.56 --> 447.0
happens I think it's probably just

445.08 --> 451.52
another Bluff to keep everybody's

447.0 --> 451.52
everybody tight on their nerves again

452.699 --> 461.099
but maybe maybe it will actually kind of

456.78 --> 463.88
end up to certain places blowing up

461.099 --> 463.88
we'll see

468.9 --> 475.34
it's the same family

472.5 --> 475.34
skull cap

475.44 --> 481.979
I've well I don't have like skull tap

478.139 --> 484.22
tap t I have Rec I do recognize skull

481.979 --> 484.21999999999997
cap

488.3 --> 493.38
I didn't know it did not know by the way

490.919 --> 496.81899999999996
it it tastes like mint

493.38 --> 496.819
so interesting

497.099 --> 500.599
I didn't know it was out there

500.699 --> 504.84000000000003
right I'll I'll keep a lookout for it

502.979 --> 507.84
but there was not like among the tea

504.84 --> 510.37899999999996
selection a skull cap t

507.84 --> 510.37899999999996
so

513.12 --> 515.36
foreign

516.96 --> 521.029
[Music]

521.24 --> 525.24
okay interesting

529.74 --> 532.339
all right

537.0 --> 540.26
all right so what's that

541.8 --> 546.8389999999999
it was flat side

544.5 --> 549.0
and Jim Bob

546.839 --> 551.9590000000001
I didn't really follow them too much

549.0 --> 551.959
today yesterday

556.08 --> 561.9590000000001
uh QE live much later

559.44 --> 564.899
I did watch like a part of that but

561.959 --> 566.64
eventually now I did actually like I

564.899 --> 570.36
didn't wasn't really active in the chat

566.64 --> 572.76
but I didn't list I did listen to it

570.36 --> 575.24
while I was playing some more Baldur's

572.76 --> 575.24
Gate too

577.27 --> 580.34
[Music]

584.82 --> 588.74
it was just a grilling Dave again

591.18 --> 598.3199999999999
right yeah that's pretty much it I think

595.32 --> 599.88
not super I was kind of just laying back

598.32 --> 604.1
because

599.88 --> 604.1
being intense like that

604.8 --> 609.4799999999999
like eventually I have to be careful I

606.66 --> 611.519
have to like stop doing that or I will

609.48 --> 613.62
like get all

611.519 --> 617.839
like

613.62 --> 617.839
I don't know overly nervous and all that

618.6 --> 623.1
I think that's also kind of why I drank

620.7 --> 626.76
the bear it's like yeah I know it kind

623.1 --> 627.72
of dims me a little just a little but I

626.76 --> 630.38
mean

627.72 --> 633.3000000000001
I've been going pretty hard

630.38 --> 636.0
and while at the same time not really

633.3 --> 638.459
getting a lot of funding for it for the

636.0 --> 640.14
quality so I'm gonna dim it down a

638.459 --> 643.2199999999999
little

640.14 --> 643.22
that's what I'm doing

646.5 --> 650.779
just yesterday though I'm not gonna do

648.3 --> 650.779
that today

652.32 --> 659.1
uh

654.06 --> 659.0999999999999
natural gum Spirit okay

661.68 --> 666.2399999999999
right you're going to do a terp

664.68 --> 669.42
cleanse

666.24 --> 672.5600000000001
like Owen Benjamin does or used to do I

669.42 --> 672.56
don't know if he still does that

673.74 --> 678.0
but yeah I mean especially if you've

676.5 --> 680.58
never done that before that could be

678.0 --> 683.1
very useful

680.58 --> 685.6800000000001
[Music]

683.1 --> 688.98
who invented a new world called

685.68 --> 691.64
plagiarism that's very funny

688.98 --> 691.64
foreign

707.77 --> 710.96
[Music]

717.839 --> 722.0600000000001
I'm really kind of curious by the way

722.1 --> 728.16
while not really curious but I'm gonna

725.1 --> 730.5
keep an eye out for

728.16 --> 733.1999999999999
testing information because there's like

730.5 --> 737.48
people that have that have been damaged

733.2 --> 737.48
by medical experimentation right

738.66 --> 742.1999999999999
in specific ways and I kind of Wonder

740.94 --> 746.1600000000001
like

742.2 --> 748.6800000000001
if people are testing things like

746.16 --> 752.2199999999999
turpentine cleansing

748.68 --> 754.62
and other things to try to resolve it or

752.22 --> 757.2
something see and I wonder like if that

754.62 --> 759.0600000000001
works or if that really doesn't work it

757.2 --> 762.8000000000001
might be like dangerous

759.06 --> 762.8
I'd like to know more about that

763.56 --> 768.38
so that I could potentially pass on the

768.6 --> 772.16
the information

770.279 --> 774.18
on what you could do

772.16 --> 776.3389999999999
if you're damaged by medical

774.18 --> 777.899
experimentation

776.339 --> 780.3800000000001
because there's gonna be a lot of people

777.899 --> 780.38
out there

795.48 --> 799.8000000000001
right

796.68 --> 801.7199999999999
anyway you guys probably died

799.8 --> 806.0
that's the problems that people that

801.72 --> 806.0
have that sort of damage typically

806.22 --> 812.0400000000001
unless they really snap out of it like

809.16 --> 814.5
the first go when that happens

812.04 --> 818.2199999999999
it's very unlikely they're even gonna

814.5 --> 820.079
wanna try it like alternative things

818.22 --> 822.36
okay if they had repeated medical

820.079 --> 825.4799999999999
experimentation right

822.36 --> 827.4590000000001
so and those one those people are going

825.48 --> 830.4590000000001
to be the one that have the most damage

827.459 --> 830.459
obviously

830.639 --> 837.899
but

832.5 --> 840.36
yeah I mean the ones that just by one

837.899 --> 842.7
by one experiment

840.36 --> 845.399
got damaged and then

842.7 --> 848.639
they might very well like oh what is

845.399 --> 852.68
this okay I can't trust it anymore I am

848.639 --> 852.6800000000001
now going to just try these alternatives

852.72 --> 858.24
right all depends on what they've looked

855.66 --> 861.3199999999999
at what information they gathered what

858.24 --> 861.32
who they listen to

863.54 --> 869.519
turpentine cleansing ingesting

866.1 --> 873.0
turpentine yeah it does but not just

869.519 --> 877.86
regular turpentine out of this the Clean

873.0 --> 880.139
Air store right not that stuff okay

877.86 --> 881.94
it's very specific that's why he called

880.139 --> 885.72
it

881.94 --> 888.36
gum Spirits turpentine it's very

885.72 --> 892.1990000000001
specific it's a very specific chemical

888.36 --> 895.139
very pure not the stuff

892.199 --> 898.68
did you buy in the store for cleaning

895.139 --> 898.6800000000001
things okay

901.0 --> 904.49
[Music]

all right

1077.9 --> 1082.0590000000002
okay guy from gore that's weird

1085.34 --> 1088.6599999999999
it's a weird thing to do

1209.9 --> 1215.539
what why was my mic on mute oh I forgot

1213.32 --> 1216.9189999999999
to unmute it for [Â __Â ] sake nobody even

1215.539 --> 1218.29
noticed

1216.919 --> 1221.5990000000002
okay

1218.29 --> 1221.599
[Music]

1230.059 --> 1235.7
I guess you guys missed about

1232.88 --> 1240.38
me entering Kai from Gore's question how

1235.7 --> 1242.78
about how I move around town

1240.38 --> 1244.2800000000002
on my bicycle because that way I can

1242.78 --> 1245.8999999999999
work out

1244.28 --> 1249.9189999999999
fresh air

1245.9 --> 1254.2
and it's decently fast enough

1249.919 --> 1254.2
it's only really annoying when it rains

1254.299 --> 1257.96
but

1256.28 --> 1261.62
I don't know as long as it doesn't just

1257.96 --> 1263.419
rain continually I usually am able to

1261.62 --> 1266.78
avoid it

1263.419 --> 1268.7
right anyway hello candle candle thanks

1266.78 --> 1271.78
for telling me new audio

1268.7 --> 1276.22
right when I figured it out myself

1271.78 --> 1276.22
hello lumpy gas in the vacuum

1277.28 --> 1281.78
does everybody in the Netherlands have

1279.32 --> 1286.1789999999999
their own bicycle

1281.78 --> 1286.1789999999999
I think most people do actually

1288.32 --> 1294.5
I think that even people that

1292.22 --> 1296.1200000000001
go in their car and everything and there

1294.5 --> 1298.46
are some of those

1296.12 --> 1301.1
they do will still have like a bicycle

1298.46 --> 1304.58
on the side

1301.1 --> 1308.4189999999999
because it's also like for some people a

1304.58 --> 1311.48
social event to like everybody

1308.419 --> 1313.4
groups together on their bicycle or

1311.48 --> 1315.919
sometimes some other thing like a sick

1313.4 --> 1319.94
way or whatever nonsense transport

1315.919 --> 1321.5590000000002
thingy but yeah typically in it's in

1319.94 --> 1324.3200000000002
it's always been a bicycle and then you

1321.559 --> 1327.98
just go out on some bike trail

1324.32 --> 1331.28
together chatting and enjoying the

1327.98 --> 1333.74
outdoor right so yes most people do have

1331.28 --> 1335.96
a bike even if they're

1333.74 --> 1338.539
like wealthy and

1335.96 --> 1340.7
used cars I think my landlord probably

1338.539 --> 1342.86
doesn't have a bike

1340.7 --> 1345.44
on the other hand he would be crazy not

1342.86 --> 1348.1399999999999
to since he has like a Hummer and you

1345.44 --> 1350.48
can't get around in town with that

1348.14 --> 1352.8400000000001
so I think that even he probably has a

1350.48 --> 1352.84
bicycle

1354.08 --> 1360.22
but I don't know never seen him on one

1357.74 --> 1360.22
uh

1366.54 --> 1372.799
[Music]

1370.7 --> 1374.419
so yes David most people in the

1372.799 --> 1376.52
Netherlands have their own bicycle it is

1374.419 --> 1378.74
very Dutch

1376.52 --> 1382.4189999999999
and there's like

1378.74 --> 1385.1
bike trails everywhere like we have

1382.419 --> 1388.039
asphalted bike trails in a lot of the

1385.1 --> 1391.6589999999999
places where you literally can't go with

1388.039 --> 1391.6589999999999
a car but you can with a bicycle

1395.12 --> 1398.02
or walking

1400.94 --> 1406.46
or they have this evid even separated

1403.28 --> 1409.1
right so yeah bicycle having a bicycle

1406.46 --> 1411.5
in the Netherlands is really nice

1409.1 --> 1414.4599999999998
because there's accommodations for that

1411.5 --> 1414.46
a lot of it

1414.5 --> 1419.36
have their own traffic signs

1417.62 --> 1421.6399999999999
everywhere

1419.36 --> 1423.039
and they're very separate from traffic

1421.64 --> 1428.679
signs

1423.039 --> 1428.679
concerning Vehicles motorized vehicles

1433.159 --> 1438.5590000000002
yeah and it's been like that forever I

1435.799 --> 1441.2
mean I think at least since the 50s but

1438.559 --> 1444.26
probably even before that

1441.2 --> 1446.179
like we I think it's probably since the

1444.26 --> 1448.8799999999999
bicycle really became popular the

1446.179 --> 1451.8200000000002
Netherlands just really jumped on it

1448.88 --> 1456.3400000000001
which would probably be like in the

1451.82 --> 1456.34
18th or 19th century somewhere

1458.78 --> 1464.1789999999999
somebody can probably Google it I don't

1462.02 --> 1465.9189999999999
know it's not important to my point but

1464.179 --> 1468.2800000000002
yeah Netherlands always been the bicycle

1465.919 --> 1468.2800000000002
country

1475.159 --> 1478.0
foreign

1506.96 --> 1509.96
foreign

1515.26 --> 1520.82
right so anyway

1518.059 --> 1523.28
any other questions

1520.82 --> 1525.58
thing anything you would like me to get

1523.28 --> 1525.58
into

1527.0 --> 1532.52
talk about

1529.58 --> 1534.02
I'm gonna bring some item to my

1532.52 --> 1536.6589999999999
attention

1534.02 --> 1540.94
please do so

1536.659 --> 1540.94
because I'm just kind of laid back today

1549.919 --> 1554.48
that's a lot of stretching apparently

1559.52 --> 1565.46
man I had it's so weird by the way that

1562.34 --> 1566.84
I do much very much feel a difference

1565.46 --> 1569.48
today

1566.84 --> 1570.799
from just drinking one beer compared to

1569.48 --> 1572.539
like the last

1570.799 --> 1576.62
four days

1572.539 --> 1578.779
it's I mean it's not a lot but like it's

1576.62 --> 1581.559
palpably something I can't believe it

1578.779 --> 1581.559
it's just one

1594.64 --> 1602.38
it's I just it amazes me that it is so

1603.14 --> 1608.0590000000002
palpable to me

1605.659 --> 1611.8400000000001
even though it's very little that I can

1608.059 --> 1615.559
just notice the difference so much like

1611.84 --> 1617.6589999999999
I know I've been like saying that even

1615.559 --> 1619.52
as I was kind of like transitioning to

1617.659 --> 1622.72
stopping to drink

1619.52 --> 1622.72
but yeah

1623.72 --> 1628.159
I mean I'm getting used to not drinking

1625.76 --> 1632.12
anymore and now to just do it like one

1628.159 --> 1635.0
beer and just like whoa I can now like

1632.12 --> 1638.9799999999998
almost a day later still feel that it

1635.0 --> 1638.98
just had one beer that's so weird

1643.52 --> 1649.179
it's not even that bad or anything it's

1645.799 --> 1649.179
just palpably different

1649.52 --> 1654.3799999999999
like the internal

1651.5 --> 1657.279
Spirit chemistry is just a range

1654.38 --> 1657.279
slightly different

1660.98 --> 1663.46
anyway

1663.5 --> 1666.5
foreign

1671.86 --> 1677.8999999999999
will fall off his bike everybody else

1674.539 --> 1679.7
but after fall no but they would

1677.9 --> 1681.98
absolutely

1679.7 --> 1683.96
have to pretend like they can't see it's

1681.98 --> 1686.179
happening except for his personal

1683.96 --> 1688.039
assistance and then if anybody ever

1686.179 --> 1692.1200000000001
mentions it they'll probably get the

1688.039 --> 1694.58
death penalties or something or

1692.12 --> 1695.4189999999999
something terrible punishment of some

1694.58 --> 1698.1999999999998
kind

1695.419 --> 1698.2
so

1698.24 --> 1702.44
but no not everybody's gonna fall off

1700.58 --> 1705.039
their bike if if he does that that's

1702.44 --> 1705.039
ridiculous

1707.84 --> 1712.58
or maybe like a certain General would do

1711.62 --> 1715.1
that

1712.58 --> 1717.4399999999998
to try to and make it look really stupid

1715.1 --> 1721.6
of him just to draw attention away in

1717.44 --> 1721.6000000000001
that moment I mean but not everybody

1723.02 --> 1730.96
the [Â __Â ] no don't don't do that Matthew

1726.62 --> 1730.9599999999998
Eastman just don't do that

1731.09 --> 1736.82
[Music]

1733.52 --> 1739.82
by the way talking about which I think

1736.82 --> 1742.1
like one of my roommates the gay one I

1739.82 --> 1744.02
think he's now in a conflict with my

1742.1 --> 1746.059
landlord

1744.02 --> 1747.799
I haven't like addressed him or anybody

1746.059 --> 1751.539
directly about it but I've been hearing

1747.799 --> 1751.539
them having conversations about

1753.08 --> 1759.08
going

1754.34 --> 1762.559
to brutal Shaolin where I've also gone

1759.08 --> 1764.899
for lawyers so I think he's like doing

1762.559 --> 1767.4189999999999
the same [Â __Â ] that he did to me a couple

1764.899 --> 1768.559
of years ago remember some of you might

1767.419 --> 1771.3200000000002
remember

1768.559 --> 1774.3799999999999
went all nuts and started like writing

1771.32 --> 1777.9189999999999
literal letters and emails to like

1774.38 --> 1780.2
everybody I knew that he knew I knew

1777.919 --> 1784.279
and and literally like complaining about

1780.2 --> 1785.8990000000001
how crazy and scary I am dangerous like

1784.279 --> 1789.08
completely insane

1785.899 --> 1791.6589999999999
and oh he did that based on a rumor that

1789.08 --> 1794.24
another roommate literally told him it

1791.659 --> 1795.5
has a complete line the same one that's

1794.24 --> 1798.76
that

1795.5 --> 1798.76
stole my

1800.72 --> 1806.659
my uh my screwdrivers no yeah my

1804.74 --> 1809.179
screwdriver said that I

1806.659 --> 1812.1200000000001
figured out like two weeks ago

1809.179 --> 1815.0590000000002
were missing

1812.12 --> 1819.26
right so but I know that it can go

1815.059 --> 1820.8799999999999
pretty nuts so I literally warned them I

1819.26 --> 1822.62
literally I was there where everybody

1820.88 --> 1826.1200000000001
was and said like

1822.62 --> 1826.12
do you want to stay here

1826.22 --> 1832.039
because if you start doing this he's

1829.82 --> 1834.1399999999999
never gonna let off the guy is

1832.039 --> 1836.059
effectively a psychopath when it comes

1834.14 --> 1837.44
to this kind of thing

1836.059 --> 1839.24
he

1837.44 --> 1842.179
is going to make your life really

1839.24 --> 1844.659
miserable and feel very Justified for

1842.179 --> 1844.659
doing it

1846.02 --> 1850.34
and

1847.279 --> 1852.559
so I warned them like I didn't sign on

1850.34 --> 1855.32
their little project of trying to like

1852.559 --> 1858.5
oh it's over charging

1855.32 --> 1861.9189999999999
it's like yeah cool that's really cool

1858.5 --> 1864.86
and all I'd like to just have a life

1861.919 --> 1868.1000000000001
and not six months of getting nagged and

1864.86 --> 1870.8799999999999
stressed out and bullied around

1868.1 --> 1870.8799999999999
so

1874.46 --> 1879.8600000000001
then I think that it it's I mean the

1877.399 --> 1882.86
price increase has been egregious

1879.86 --> 1886.0
but understandable considering the

1882.86 --> 1886.0
circumstances out there

1888.98 --> 1894.26
and he's not just gonna get cheaper

1891.14 --> 1896.6000000000001
power out of nowhere right anyway

1894.26 --> 1900.039
so that's also happening

1896.6 --> 1900.039
Our Winning house life

1900.62 --> 1903.279
huh

1909.38 --> 1915.0200000000002
didn't know I were a big drink I'm not a

1912.08 --> 1919.1789999999999
big drinker at all metal slugs master

1915.02 --> 1919.179
why would you say I'm a big drinker

1921.679 --> 1926.96
I'm not at all I like I literally can't

1924.02 --> 1929.48
handle more than three bears well to be

1926.96 --> 1933.58
fair like half liters that's what I used

1929.48 --> 1933.58
to drink for like a couple of years now

1933.62 --> 1938.1789999999999
but never more than that that's that

1936.5 --> 1941.679
doesn't make me a big drinker it doesn't

1938.179 --> 1941.679
make me a daily Drinker though

1946.52 --> 1951.52
or it made me because I'm not doing that

1949.279 --> 1951.52
anymore

1957.44 --> 1962.24
but I will probably occasionally

1962.419 --> 1967.46
which is like I don't know once a week

1965.48 --> 1970.52
or once a month I don't know

1967.46 --> 1973.52
whenever very specific type of impulse

1970.52 --> 1975.26
it's for like inner management I might

1973.52 --> 1977.539
have one beer

1975.26 --> 1980.24
that's how I'm gonna go about it with it

1977.539 --> 1981.799
now and see if that works because as

1980.24 --> 1984.5
soon as I'm gonna feel like I'm getting

1981.799 --> 1986.6589999999999
pulled back in I'm just gonna completely

1984.5 --> 1989.08
lay off it

1986.659 --> 1989.0800000000002
again

1990.38 --> 1996.2
or yeah just not feel inclined to

1993.86 --> 1999.62
sometimes take one so

1996.2 --> 2003.1200000000001
but I've never been a big drinker I mean

1999.62 --> 2003.12
I can't handle my liquor

2004.779 --> 2007.679
I'll get sick

2013.0 --> 2015.659
anyway

2029.62 --> 2034.7399999999998
okay

2031.299 --> 2034.74
funny I guess

2038.86 --> 2043.4189999999999
all right but

2040.539 --> 2045.96
it's not that's not just the difference

2043.419 --> 2045.96
though

2047.559 --> 2051.419
but I get it very funny

2065.44 --> 2067.619
foreign

2079.899 --> 2083.339
anything else guys

2083.679 --> 2087.899
is this it is this what you got

2093.94 --> 2098.82
I mean you're not exactly handing me a

2096.099 --> 2098.82
subject here

2106.06 --> 2113.04
and one beer no not One A Day Metal

2109.42 --> 2113.04
slugs Master not doing that

2120.339 --> 2124.7999999999997
oh okay melts look that's hilarious

2128.74 --> 2135.7
right but I mean

2132.339 --> 2138.22
if they liked drinking together

2135.7 --> 2140.2599999999998
and they had probably a thing with it

2138.22 --> 2143.02
well that's great

2140.26 --> 2147.0400000000004
I mean yeah you can get I mean if you

2143.02 --> 2149.079
like with your spouse and you really

2147.04 --> 2151.9
love her and all that

2149.079 --> 2154.3
and and you would like have a beer a day

2151.9 --> 2157.7200000000003
or two

2154.3 --> 2160.6600000000003
as like a like a personal tradition

2157.72 --> 2163.56
between you lovers tradition well yeah

2160.66 --> 2163.56
that would be great

2165.52 --> 2169.78
and drinking alone is not fun I mean

2168.099 --> 2171.7000000000003
when I drink

2169.78 --> 2173.98
it's usually

2171.7 --> 2174.7999999999997
like when I'm on the Flat Earth debates

2173.98 --> 2176.2
panels

2174.8 --> 2178.96
[Music]

2176.2 --> 2180.8799999999997
right among other people that I can

2178.96 --> 2183.04
interact with

2180.88 --> 2185.579
if I'm just by myself like in the

2183.04 --> 2185.579
weekends

2185.68 --> 2190.24
then yeah I might be like watching stuff

2188.26 --> 2192.1600000000003
maybe interacting in some chat but

2190.24 --> 2193.7799999999997
that's still not as satisfying as

2192.16 --> 2197.7
actually

2193.78 --> 2197.7000000000003
being able to verbally communicate

2198.7 --> 2204.48
and face to face if you can really get

2201.099 --> 2204.48
along that's even better

2204.579 --> 2207.119
right

2211.9 --> 2215.56
so I'm sure you can be very healthy with

2214.18 --> 2218.68
that

2215.56 --> 2220.54
but for me I don't know I'm just taking

2218.68 --> 2225.46
note that even drinking that one beer

2220.54 --> 2228.2799999999997
just has a measurable influence on my

2225.46 --> 2232.839
on my concentration you could say

2228.28 --> 2232.8390000000004
and on feelings inside

2238.48 --> 2245.04
it's just a feeling a slight alteration

2241.839 --> 2245.04
like it's slightly different

2245.8 --> 2250.9
and yeah if you can live with that if

2247.839 --> 2253.839
you don't do what I do basically where

2250.9 --> 2255.64
I'm deep diving thinking heavy thoughts

2253.839 --> 2257.98
and like really structurizing them

2255.64 --> 2260.44
because if you're not doing that yeah

2257.98 --> 2263.72
why wouldn't you why wouldn't you just

2260.44 --> 2266.8
have a beer every day you know

2263.72 --> 2269.68
[Music]

2266.8 --> 2272.1400000000003
well if it gets in the way in a very

2269.68 --> 2277.74
specific processes that you do well then

2272.14 --> 2277.74
it really does become an an obstacle

2286.06 --> 2290.02
yeah Aries 106. yeah I find it annoying

2288.52 --> 2292.0
as well that's why I pointed it out

2290.02 --> 2293.859
yesterday on the show thank you for

2292.0 --> 2296.619
taking note of that

2293.859 --> 2298.48
but then later he did actually just say

2296.619 --> 2300.6400000000003
that he did agree with me but it is like

2298.48 --> 2303.099
a reflex sometimes

2300.64 --> 2304.839
I mean I really it's so weird man

2303.099 --> 2308.02
because it sometimes really does feel

2304.839 --> 2309.82
like I'm just almost not welcome there

2308.02 --> 2311.859
everybody can just speak up and

2309.82 --> 2315.099
everybody will let everybody speak up

2311.859 --> 2317.02
but when I speak up then

2315.099 --> 2319.6600000000003
it's like wait till he's finished and

2317.02 --> 2323.56
quickly move on

2319.66 --> 2327.339
really I don't get it like why like am I

2323.56 --> 2329.68
not a part of the process there

2327.339 --> 2330.82
people just not want to listen to me for

2329.68 --> 2333.66
some reason

2330.82 --> 2333.6600000000003
I don't get it

2336.16 --> 2342.359
what is an Arwen it's an arwinian unit

2339.16 --> 2346.96
not an R win Union an Our Winning unit

2342.359 --> 2349.72
is in the measure of apparent distances

2346.96 --> 2352.54
right one Armenian unit is a rainbow two

2349.72 --> 2356.0989999999997
Our Winning units is the moon three are

2352.54 --> 2356.099
winning units is the Sun

2360.76 --> 2366.76
apparent distances so it's a virtual

2364.06 --> 2370.96
distance yeah so Arwin Our Winning unit

2366.76 --> 2373.78
is a measure of virtual apparent

2370.96 --> 2376.66
distances it's purely psychological it's

2373.78 --> 2379.619
a psychological measuring state

2376.66 --> 2379.6189999999997
laughs

[Music]

2387.59 --> 2395.94
[Music]

2393.22 --> 2398.7999999999997
how do you agree on the construct by

2395.94 --> 2401.56
accepting it and using it

2398.8 --> 2404.2000000000003
I mean there's not an alternative for it

2401.56 --> 2406.7999999999997
unless you know

2404.2 --> 2406.7999999999997
like

2407.98 --> 2410.94
what do you call that

2413.98 --> 2420.22
unless you have a measuring method for

2417.88 --> 2421.6600000000003
apparent distances that already exist to

2420.22 --> 2425.56
present

2421.66 --> 2427.96
I'm gonna assume that an Armenian unit

2425.56 --> 2430.7799999999997
is the first

2427.96 --> 2433.119
measurement of an apparent distance

2430.78 --> 2435.7200000000003
like it's the first uh

2433.119 --> 2435.7200000000003
damn it

2437.65 --> 2443.389
[Music]

2447.46 --> 2451.7400000000002
yeah

2448.9 --> 2451.7400000000002
measure

2453.19 --> 2456.389
[Music]

2462.52 --> 2467.079
I can't find the right words that

2464.74 --> 2469.66
describe what that is like a

2467.079 --> 2472.0600000000004
measurement unit

2469.66 --> 2475.66
maybe that is it if you know any

2472.06 --> 2477.7
measurement units out there

2475.66 --> 2480.64
for apparent distances I like to know

2477.7 --> 2483.3999999999996
about it if not then I'm probably the

2480.64 --> 2485.7
first to come up with that

2483.4 --> 2485.7000000000003
foreign

2486.339 --> 2491.2599999999998
which is very logical by the way since I

2489.339 --> 2493.9
do have

2491.26 --> 2497.579
well non-local Holograms

2493.9 --> 2497.579
in my cosmology model

2498.28 --> 2504.1600000000003
I don't think that it in the generally

2501.46 --> 2507.18
considered cosmologies out there there

2504.16 --> 2507.18
is a need

2507.579 --> 2514.0
for a unit of apparent distances

2511.06 --> 2517.599
because they don't think that exists

2514.0 --> 2520.72
not in a regular way anyway enough to

2517.599 --> 2523.0
make a specific measurement unit out of

2520.72 --> 2526.3199999999997
it well I do because I think it's an

2523.0 --> 2526.32
integral part of the realm

2538.93 --> 2542.14
[Music]

2552.28 --> 2556.3590000000004
that's why fpd rush you on what do you

2555.28 --> 2560.099
mean

2556.359 --> 2560.0989999999997
what are you talking about rest Dad

2562.42 --> 2566.8
where we need unit this

2564.94 --> 2569.52
are you talking about

2566.8 --> 2569.52
turret

2571.24 --> 2576.8799999999997
no it's not based on the presupposed

2574.24 --> 2579.5789999999997
distances

2576.88 --> 2583.56
of the Sun and the Moon in the

2579.579 --> 2583.5600000000004
heliocentric cosmology turret

2586.119 --> 2593.56
and it's not an astronomical unit which

2589.42 --> 2595.8
is a apparent or apparently so let's not

2593.56 --> 2598.44
get it too confusing

2595.8 --> 2600.819
apparently it is a

2598.44 --> 2603.94
astronomical measurement

2600.819 --> 2605.619
it's a unit of distance an astronomical

2603.94 --> 2606.579
unit

2605.619 --> 2610.319
right

2606.579 --> 2610.319
but that's not an arwenian unit

2610.54 --> 2613.92
what by the way

2614.26 --> 2619.3590000000004
I don't get it

2617.079 --> 2620.84
I think that's a math joke from tarot

2619.359 --> 2624.0499999999997
there I don't get it

[Music]

2627.579 --> 2629.819

2648.28 --> 2654.5400000000004
yeah exactly so you're reifying the

2650.98 --> 2654.54
models very funny

2675.04 --> 2680.22
who didn't measure anything apparent

2680.38 --> 2683.099
well

2685.07 --> 2691.2000000000003
[Music]

2687.54 --> 2691.2
what are you talking about

2697.0 --> 2701.46
what are you talking about raster hat

2709.0 --> 2714.579
what are you expecting me to actually

2712.14 --> 2718.14
physically measure

2714.579 --> 2718.1400000000003
an apparent distance

2722.76 --> 2727.8390000000004
oh yeah thanks thanks for Esther hat

2725.8 --> 2729.94
thanks Captain Obvious like what the

2727.839 --> 2733.74
[Â __Â ] going on here man

2729.94 --> 2733.7400000000002
like you think I don't know that

2734.02 --> 2741.18
I'm laying it out right now

2737.859 --> 2741.18
what the hell are you doing

2756.28 --> 2763.2400000000002
I'm just trying to explain the Armenian

2759.22 --> 2766.1189999999997
unit what it represents

2763.24 --> 2768.7
why are you talking to me like I'm

2766.119 --> 2771.06
actually saying it's a real measurement

2768.7 --> 2771.06
of unit

2771.46 --> 2777.2200000000003
I'm literally explaining it's apparent

2774.42 --> 2779.079
it's self-contradicting in that sense

2777.22 --> 2780.7599999999998
but yeah I don't really care because

2779.079 --> 2782.46
it's funny

2780.76 --> 2786.76
and

2782.46 --> 2789.579
it leads to a clearer view on the

2786.76 --> 2791.26
non-local Hologram nature of the

2789.579 --> 2794.099
celestials

2791.26 --> 2794.099
that is all

2803.68 --> 2806.46
you can't

2807.16 --> 2811.3799999999997
what the [Â __Â ] are you doing Rasta hat

attention

2836.14 --> 2840.16
I sent you a message over Skype you

2838.06 --> 2843.66
didn't respond to

2840.16 --> 2843.66
for almost a week now

2872.02 --> 2875.52
it's getting on the nose

2879.64 --> 2883.319
what do you mean on the nose

2884.8 --> 2890.099
I'm just having a casual conversation

2887.26 --> 2890.099
about it

2890.2 --> 2895.359
when it was brought up I literally was

2893.079 --> 2900.3390000000004
explaining

how that must have been a joke dude

2951.64 --> 2955.839
the other guys bring up our winning

2953.92 --> 2960.2400000000002
units yeah

2955.839 --> 2960.24
what are you talking about fantasism

2960.52 --> 2965.88
that you misspelled

2963.04 --> 2965.88

2977.74 --> 2982.7799999999997

2980.98 --> 2986.76

any more Ballwin

3047.22 --> 3052.0789999999997

still will say no

3069.9 --> 3075.1800000000003

3086.04 --> 3091.44
the one that you literally on a

3088.14 --> 3095.339
face-to-face Skype call promised me

3091.44 --> 3098.16
to give me that one those finances that

3095.339 --> 3101.04
you literally to my face all gloating

3098.16 --> 3107.359

3114.42 --> 3120.96
said you would not try

3170.28 --> 3174.48
listen to you bragging about how much

3172.2 --> 3177.02
money you're making yeah

3174.48 --> 3177.02
okay

3177.059 --> 3181.98
because I don't like when you do that

3179.339 --> 3186.359
especially when I am poor

3181.98 --> 3189.72
I don't like it I tolerate it

3186.359 --> 3192.54
but when you then tell me

3189.72 --> 3194.04
yeah I'll give you some after I haven't

3192.54 --> 3197.579
asked

3194.04 --> 3199.74
then I expect you to hold your promise I

3197.579 --> 3202.1400000000003
don't care if you're partying if you

3199.74 --> 3205.14
make a promise

that's a promise

3228.96 --> 3234.119
your word is a promise isn't it

3232.14 --> 3237.7999999999997
you not like that

3234.119 --> 3237.8
when my when I say something

3237.9 --> 3243.599
I mean it I that's a promise

3241.079 --> 3246.0

3243.599 --> 3249.1800000000003
it I will immediately

3246.0 --> 3251.4
as soon as I figure that out by my own

3249.18 --> 3255.0589999999997
volition share like wait I was wrong

3251.4 --> 3256.26
about this I can't do that sorry

3276.48 --> 3281.48
a promise to me last week while you were

3279.119 --> 3281.48

3321.66 --> 3324.92
I'm not taking it

3325.619 --> 3332.52
I don't want that yeah

3328.68 --> 3338.0589999999997
me taking donations is for my show not

3332.52 --> 3338.059

give it to me

3348.3 --> 3354.3
don't make me drag it out of you

3351.26 --> 3355.9

3424.38 --> 3427.04

3429.24 --> 3432.9599999999996
happened

3430.44 --> 3434.339
especially after having to endure the

3432.96 --> 3437.46
gloating

3434.339 --> 3439.98
and then I expect you

3437.46 --> 3442.319
if there was some kind of accident to be

3439.98 --> 3446.359
freaking modest about it

3442.319 --> 3446.359
and not start to push back

3446.4 --> 3450.6800000000003

3452.22 --> 3455.2999999999997

don't do that in my chat okay

3473.4 --> 3478.5

that's strenuous to me you don't seem to

3988.079 --> 3992.88
give a [Â __Â ]

3990.059 --> 3995.6400000000003
you're just trying to play me

3992.88 --> 3998.819
I'm not buying that [Â __Â ] yeah and I'm

3995.64 --> 4001.16
not gonna just give you friendship like

3998.819 --> 4004.0389999999998
that when you act like this I'm done

4006.799 --> 4011.359
for crying out loud

4009.02 --> 4013.22
and have some humility yeah I know

4023.359 --> 4028.0989999999997
towards people that obviously don't have

4025.819 --> 4030.64
that I don't do that

4028.099 --> 4030.6400000000003

don't talk about that

4090.559 --> 4094.76

4092.599 --> 4098.319
backtracking yeah

4094.76 --> 4098.319

4112.04 --> 4117.14
just seriously

4114.14 --> 4120.4400000000005
he could have just said

4117.14 --> 4123.799
oh yeah [Â __Â ] sorry man

4129.5 --> 4135.199

4132.739 --> 4137.7789999999995
he had to take it personal how dare

4135.199 --> 4140.12
Arwin actually expect when somebody

4137.779 --> 4142.9400000000005
tells you they're gonna do something oh

4140.12 --> 4145.64
it doesn't actually mean that though oh

4142.94 --> 4147.5599999999995
so words don't mean what they say

4145.64 --> 4150.799
anymore when they come out of you okay

4147.56 --> 4152.839000000001
Rasta hat yeah yeah yeah you can stay

4150.799 --> 4155.66
over there why did you just go do what

4152.839 --> 4160.48
you do and I'll do what I do

4155.66 --> 4160.48
without you doing that here yeah

4173.319 --> 4179.5
all right let's see if we can still do

4176.299 --> 4179.5
with this freaking show

4180.08 --> 4185.179
that okay that's silly what if the Earth

4183.14 --> 4186.9800000000005
stops spinning yet I mean I think

4185.179 --> 4188.719
there's even like a movie about that

4186.98 --> 4192.16
nonsense Derek

4188.719 --> 4192.16
like a Hollywood movie

4192.24 --> 4195.45

4204.5 --> 4209.199
nothing Aries 106 it's a different

the Earth spinning in Hell have nothing

4213.8 --> 4217.6990000000005

4218.96 --> 4221.96
foreign

4247.06 --> 4252.620000000001
catch up on some old Benjamin

4249.98 --> 4254.36
still haven't watched fully finished the

4252.62 --> 4257.239
the Monday episode

4254.36 --> 4260.62
I really gotta catch up on this [Â __Â ]

4257.239 --> 4260.62
because he's doing great

4260.719 --> 4264.28
just haven't gotten to it

4270.4 --> 4275.44
there's that they say it is publicly now

4278.12 --> 4281.44
that's weird Tarot

4286.04 --> 4290.179
telling everybody to get ready for

4288.38 --> 4292.34
disasters Maybe

4290.179 --> 4294.86
I mean maybe dude maybe they're just

4292.34 --> 4296.84
gonna like get to like earthquake

4294.86 --> 4298.759999999999
weapons and [Â __Â ] and just completely

4296.84 --> 4300.9800000000005
destroy the entire

4298.76 --> 4304.6990000000005
landscape

4300.98 --> 4307.339999999999
not just where the war is at right I

4304.699 --> 4309.44
mean yeah who knows

4307.34 --> 4313.360000000001
if they're really gonna go all the way

4309.44 --> 4313.36
what kind of Weaponry will come out

4317.06 --> 4319.84
foreign

4330.46 --> 4334.58
yeah but they've been telling everybody

4332.54 --> 4336.5
for years all kinds of nonsense though

4334.58 --> 4339.86
George Sanford so that doesn't really

4336.5 --> 4341.78
mean all that much

4339.86 --> 4343.639999999999
I mean there's not I don't think there's

4341.78 --> 4345.88
any kind of natural event like that

4343.64 --> 4345.88
coming

4353.239 --> 4358.36
did

4354.44 --> 4358.36
well maybe it will I just

4361.04 --> 4365.36
in my Visions there was not just some

4363.38 --> 4367.900000000001
point where suddenly everything was

4365.36 --> 4367.9
trashed

4367.94 --> 4372.08
so if there's going to be some gigantic

4370.52 --> 4373.34
earthquake then I think that at least

4372.08 --> 4374.659
it's not going to be here in the

4373.34 --> 4375.860000000001
Netherlands

4374.659 --> 4377.96
so

4375.86 --> 4380.5599999999995
it's not going to be universally

4377.96 --> 4380.56
everywhere

4387.08 --> 4392.8
sure event no

4389.84 --> 4392.8
nonsense

4395.96 --> 4401.6
so if there's any Rapture I don't think

4398.239 --> 4405.339999999999
it has anything to do with Christ

4401.6 --> 4405.34
with the actual Jesus

4423.98 --> 4426.5199999999995

4460.88 --> 4466.159000000001
makes no sense

4463.52 --> 4470.120000000001
unless the Raptor is part of like some

4466.159 --> 4472.759999999999
kind of a shock wave that'll literally

4470.12 --> 4474.98
launch people spiritually out of their

4472.76 --> 4476.719
bodies or something I mean maybe

4474.98 --> 4478.58
something like that could happen I

4476.719 --> 4480.679
actually have very weird Dark World

4478.58 --> 4484.239
Vision experiences

4480.679 --> 4484.2390000000005
that were playing into that

4486.14 --> 4492.679
like they're in my vision and I have no

4489.32 --> 4494.36
idea whether this is real or not okay it

4492.679 --> 4496.46
was a pretty far

4494.36 --> 4498.62
trip there

4496.46 --> 4500.42
is not like early stages where

4498.62 --> 4502.64
everything was like really super crystal

4500.42 --> 4505.04
clear

4502.64 --> 4507.860000000001
it might not happen

4505.04 --> 4509.179
but there was a strong impression that

4507.86 --> 4512.54
there would be some kind of a weird

4509.179 --> 4517.12
event where I don't know everybody and

4512.54 --> 4517.12
everything would die but would be

4517.84 --> 4524.2390000000005
continuing exactly as it were

4521.179 --> 4528.14
as like a ghost

4524.239 --> 4531.08
but like a fully projected like an

4528.14 --> 4533.4800000000005
actual human being projection like that

4531.08 --> 4535.82
there's literally just like like a

4533.48 --> 4539.12
Holodeck

4535.82 --> 4541.28
like we would continue like our Spirits

4539.12 --> 4543.14
actually would continue in a

4541.28 --> 4546.82
non-corporeal way but yeah it sounds

4543.14 --> 4546.820000000001
extremely science fiction so

4550.82 --> 4555.86
it going through that all made little

4554.6 --> 4557.780000000001
sense

4555.86 --> 4561.5599999999995
to me

4557.78 --> 4564.44
we came sleeping no the vision the

4561.56 --> 4567.46
80-year vision I had

4564.44 --> 4567.46
into the future

4567.5 --> 4570.64
that one

4574.28 --> 4579.08
right but in that one by the way

4576.62 --> 4581.84
throwing the whole thing I was convinced

4579.08 --> 4586.96
that nukes were real also and very

4581.84 --> 4586.96
preoccupied with that in a big segment

4588.86 --> 4592.219
mostly just trying to prevent that from

4591.08 --> 4596.199
happening

4592.219 --> 4596.199
I had no idea that it wasn't real

4596.84 --> 4603.28
I got to like see

4599.06 --> 4603.280000000001
those explosions like in 3D

4604.82 --> 4610.759999999999
but yeah I can't tell whether that was

4607.34 --> 4612.9800000000005
even a trick from demons to do that

4610.76 --> 4616.9400000000005
or whether there really is some kind of

4612.98 --> 4620.239
insanely large explosion that's

4616.94 --> 4622.219
probably not a nuclear fission reaction

4620.239 --> 4625.419999999999
but something else that's still

4622.219 --> 4625.42
extremely destructive

4626.9 --> 4629.86
I'm not sure

4631.4 --> 4636.62
do you want a vision about that oh good

4634.52 --> 4638.780000000001
luck with that you're gonna have to then

4636.62 --> 4641.0
attain that

4638.78 --> 4644.0
you can't just have a vision of

4641.0 --> 4646.159
something and then

4644.0 --> 4647.719
like you can't just have a vision of

4646.159 --> 4650.32
something that you want that's not how

4647.719 --> 4650.32
that works

4650.9 --> 4655.879999999999
I mean the you wanting it will play a

4653.48 --> 4658.159
role probably but it doesn't mean it's

4655.88 --> 4661.9400000000005
gonna just happen like you want it's not

4658.159 --> 4665.199
just a fantasy in your mind

4661.94 --> 4665.199
that you can control

4666.02 --> 4668.860000000001
like that

4674.9 --> 4679.58
I mean I could control things about it

4676.94 --> 4681.5
but I couldn't control the story like

4679.58 --> 4685.84
the thing as it was unfolding all of it

4681.5 --> 4689.0
could just have direct surrounding

4685.84 --> 4692.02
manipulation abilities and

4689.0 --> 4692.02
all kinds of things

4692.36 --> 4699.98
but I could not change the story

4695.239 --> 4701.78
or like the setting a good nudge things

4699.98 --> 4704.9
within it

4701.78 --> 4706.36
that's the best I could do

4704.9 --> 4711.549999999999
anyway

4706.36 --> 4711.549999999999
[Music]

4738.5 --> 4741.28
foreign

4769.1 --> 4775.159000000001
99 of those divisions are and prophecies

4772.88 --> 4777.5
are apocalyptic

4775.159 --> 4778.4
well it's only logical in a way because

4777.5 --> 4781.64
of

4778.4 --> 4782.839999999999
entropy of the Earthly

4781.64 --> 4786.26
right

4782.84 --> 4789.92
it's gonna get more heavy

4786.26 --> 4792.76
more degenerated like the standard will

4789.92 --> 4798.56
be people will allow everyone

4792.76 --> 4801.08
collectively to lower that standard

4798.56 --> 4804.1990000000005
it will degenerate and that's like all

4801.08 --> 4806.0
people like the way things work like the

4804.199 --> 4808.759999999999
level like there's a certain type of

4806.0 --> 4811.58
energy Highway that you can be at and

4808.76 --> 4813.7390000000005
then everything works like a way and you

4811.58 --> 4817.28
can yeah feel very comfortable doing

4813.739 --> 4819.5
that well that high way of energy is

4817.28 --> 4823.04
radically shifting

4819.5 --> 4825.219
and that happens it's like an entropy

4823.04 --> 4825.219
thing

4827.42 --> 4832.76
people that lean on the highway will

4829.64 --> 4835.2390000000005
make the highway sink you could say in

4832.76 --> 4835.2390000000005
frequency

4836.06 --> 4839.96
and it's a one-way change like unless

4838.46 --> 4842.62
somebody like

4839.96 --> 4845.96
makes a lot of effort to

4842.62 --> 4847.28
isolate that frequency and separate it

4845.96 --> 4849.86
from the rest

4847.28 --> 4854.739
to keep it that way but that will make

4849.86 --> 4854.739
them disconnect from society in ways

4855.92 --> 4861.679
otherwise if you just go with the

4858.08 --> 4863.96
general Maelstrom you're going to have

4861.679 --> 4866.2390000000005
that spiritual Highway lower too because

4863.96 --> 4868.04
it's lowering with everything and that's

4866.239 --> 4870.919999999999
the reason you do it to connect up right

4868.04 --> 4873.14
well every all those connections up are

4870.92 --> 4874.64
all just collectively lowering that

4873.14 --> 4877.76
frequency

4874.64 --> 4880.280000000001
of operating it like that

4877.76 --> 4883.400000000001
spiritual entropy

4880.28 --> 4886.759999999999
in that sense right but a person that's

4883.4 --> 4889.82
only if you like go on that autopilot

4886.76 --> 4891.7390000000005
system with that if you lean on that if

4889.82 --> 4893.239
you're like purely self-reliant it

4891.739 --> 4896.299999999999
doesn't happen there's actual spiritual

4893.239 --> 4900.82
Evolution things get tougher

4896.3 --> 4904.34
but you also gain more mystical Powers

4900.82 --> 4908.239
literally like things it does something

4904.34 --> 4910.1
magical that is very it is divine that

4908.239 --> 4911.0599999999995
that happens I'm certain of it it's not

4910.1 --> 4913.9400000000005
just

4911.06 --> 4918.26
occult [Â __Â ] or

4913.94 --> 4921.259999999999
like sorcery or something that's divine

4918.26 --> 4923.06
you do don't let the corruption in if

4921.26 --> 4925.64
you don't let the spiritual entropy the

4923.06 --> 4928.64
highway become part of your life and you

4925.64 --> 4933.159000000001
don't sink down then God will reward you

4928.64 --> 4933.159000000001
for that in these more pressuring times

4933.739 --> 4935.919999999999
foreign

4939.86 --> 4944.9
but it's logical that a lot of visions

4942.5 --> 4948.02
and increasingly so about the future are

4944.9 --> 4950.0599999999995
becoming more negative and apocalyptic

4948.02 --> 4951.92
or

4950.06 --> 4956.0
destructive

4951.92 --> 4960.58
and people being really demonic and all

4956.0 --> 4964.219
that it's a logical because that is like

4960.58 --> 4966.76
statistically impossible to avoid

4964.219 --> 4966.76
foreign

4969.219 --> 4975.08
goes through that by the way

4972.5 --> 4979.04
throughout history

4975.08 --> 4981.38
Empire really does is about building

4979.04 --> 4983.42
that spiritual Highway that everybody

4981.38 --> 4985.88
can trust upon and then you do business

4983.42 --> 4987.4400000000005
with that and you do everything with

4985.88 --> 4989.42
that but

4987.44 --> 4992.96
through terrible corruption and

4989.42 --> 4995.659
decisions from top down eventually

4992.96 --> 4998.12
things will be rearranged and the

4995.659 --> 5001.599999999999
highway will just lower and lower

4998.12 --> 5002.739
gradually over the generations

5001.6 --> 5005.1990000000005
people

5002.739 --> 5007.599999999999
and then a new standard of doing

5005.199 --> 5009.219
everything might set in like a reset an

5007.6 --> 5012.88
Empire reset

5009.219 --> 5014.8
and then it will have a new standard but

5012.88 --> 5017.26
that is still lower than the original

5014.8 --> 5019.6
and that will keep reappening then the

5017.26 --> 5021.04
natural standard lower lower inside the

5019.6 --> 5023.679
spiritual Highway

5021.04 --> 5026.44
and then another reset and they set a

5023.679 --> 5029.02
new highway but it will be lower still

5026.44 --> 5033.78
like because it can't heighten the bar

5029.02 --> 5033.780000000001
an Empire can't it can only lower it

5037.84 --> 5043.42
except through like resets it can be

5040.6 --> 5045.34
temporary like yeah but that's usually

5043.42 --> 5046.9
like corrupted people getting killed and

5045.34 --> 5049.12
all that

5046.9 --> 5051.339999999999
and it can be slightly erased but it

5049.12 --> 5054.04
will never be like the original too much

5051.34 --> 5056.32
has happened corruption has happened and

5054.04 --> 5058.239
that will make it impossible to raise it

5056.32 --> 5060.4
to that level again because what has

5058.239 --> 5062.199
happened made that impossible

5060.4 --> 5065.799999999999
it's part of the corruption effect

5062.199 --> 5068.678999999999
unfortunately an entropy effect

5065.8 --> 5070.6
so that will keep happening

5068.679 --> 5073.719
so if you take that into account that

5070.6 --> 5076.3
that universally applies throughout time

5073.719 --> 5080.46
with all Empires

5076.3 --> 5080.46
then yeah it's not surprising that

5081.1 --> 5087.64
if you're part of an Empire and most of

5084.219 --> 5091.12
the world is now globalism Empire

5087.64 --> 5092.5
then if you have visions about the

5091.12 --> 5097.26
future

5092.5 --> 5097.26
they will become increasingly more grim

5098.92 --> 5102.12
it's only logical

5103.3 --> 5106.4400000000005
J okay

5113.64 --> 5117.84
lunar orbiter oh there

5119.5 --> 5126.159
draw chopping images from all

5123.46 --> 5129.219
jaw dropping

5126.159 --> 5131.159
looks so real

5129.219 --> 5133.02
so you know it's fake

5131.159 --> 5136.12
no

5133.02 --> 5139.179
but that looks completely different from

5136.12 --> 5141.96
the NASA footage of the Moon in front of

5139.179 --> 5141.96
the Earth

5142.32 --> 5148.199
and those creators look remarkably like

5145.42 --> 5148.1990000000005
CGI

5149.5 --> 5152.76
thanks for that link though

5160.54 --> 5163.8
it's hilarious Derek

5164.02 --> 5166.620000000001
yes

5181.12 --> 5185.199
instead of a surf in the Middle Ages

5183.46 --> 5187.6
yeah except

5185.199 --> 5190.599999999999
those surfs in the Middle Ages probably

5187.6 --> 5192.76
in many ways that you can understand and

5190.6 --> 5193.780000000001
that they wouldn't understand either by

5192.76 --> 5196.900000000001
the way

5193.78 --> 5199.12
had it better and more healthy life than

5196.9 --> 5202.9
you have

5199.12 --> 5206.94
with less distraction more Purity more

5202.9 --> 5206.94
connection spiritually to God

5225.28 --> 5230.44
why suspect that I'm just gonna review

5228.219 --> 5233.26
that supposed

5230.44 --> 5237.36
pictures of the Moon of the Moon and

5233.26 --> 5237.360000000001
Earth you can't be serious

5237.94 --> 5242.739
what you could I'm gonna make an item

5240.1 --> 5245.92
about oh yeah you love that just just

5242.739 --> 5249.159
create all this room going to fall

5245.92 --> 5251.08
detail about the nonsense because yeah

5249.159 --> 5253.719
even if we just talk about how it's

5251.08 --> 5255.82
nonsense yeah you're still giving you're

5253.719 --> 5257.5
literally Conjuring

5255.82 --> 5260.5
this fiction

5257.5 --> 5263.86
by giving it attention like that

5260.5 --> 5265.6
if you just ignore it then it might go

5263.86 --> 5269.08
away

5265.6 --> 5271.2390000000005
yeah there's no point in even starting

5269.08 --> 5274.0
to point out why it's like I don't have

5271.239 --> 5277.718999999999
to [Â __Â ] justify

5274.0 --> 5280.3
anything you get it you dumb [Â __Â ] yeah

5277.719 --> 5283.78
your ball are dumb [Â __Â ]

5280.3 --> 5287.139
I don't have to justify

5283.78 --> 5291.04
why I think the way I do about my ideas

5287.139 --> 5293.28
and I don't have to defend my position

5291.04 --> 5296.679
as a flat earther

5293.28 --> 5298.96
reviewing some stupid [Â __Â ] about space

5296.679 --> 5301.36
that can't exist according to the laws

5298.96 --> 5303.699
of thermodynamics then I'm sure you all

5301.36 --> 5306.4
have your neurotic counter responses too

5303.699 --> 5307.659
based on the deranged interpretation of

5306.4 --> 5311.46
science

5307.659 --> 5315.4
yeah they're arranged

5311.46 --> 5317.199
Incorporated in freaking chat GPT and

5315.4 --> 5319.48
all that [Â __Â ] yeah

5317.199 --> 5321.339999999999
I'm sure you have all that in your

5319.48 --> 5322.839999999999
inside of your head that works just like

5321.34 --> 5326.4400000000005
how it works in your head yeah yeah but

5322.84 --> 5330.34
I don't care I don't care for your cult

5326.44 --> 5332.259999999999
[Â __Â ] I don't have to review

5330.34 --> 5334.96
space nonsense

5332.26 --> 5338.08
to make a point because I don't give a

5334.96 --> 5340.36
[Â __Â ] about that I don't need it I don't

5338.08 --> 5342.04
need to review it

5340.36 --> 5344.739
yeah

5342.04 --> 5347.88
not talking to you by the way turret

5344.739 --> 5347.879999999999
but you know that probably

5353.28 --> 5357.6089999999995
[Music]

5374.739 --> 5379.259999999999
don't Romulan symbol yeah sure

5379.6 --> 5382.56
why not

5386.86 --> 5393.099999999999
did you know Aries 106 that Arwin

5390.46 --> 5396.94
in Elven which is the language of it

5393.1 --> 5400.42
that's what it is did you know that it

5396.94 --> 5403.259999999999
literally means friend of the eagle

5400.42 --> 5403.26
in Elven

5419.32 --> 5424.54
Legend essence

5421.54 --> 5424.54
nah

5424.719 --> 5430.2390000000005
it's convoluted some people say it's

5427.659 --> 5433.54
perfectly spherical because of

5430.239 --> 5436.839999999999
well just look at it right Eddie

5433.54 --> 5437.98
but then you have Neil deGrasse Tysons

5436.84 --> 5440.62
and all that [Â __Â ] saying it's

5437.98 --> 5443.0199999999995
pear-shaped and then you have like the

5440.62 --> 5445.78
the surface map and it's more like a

5443.02 --> 5450.820000000001
weird chunky potato

5445.78 --> 5453.639
oh it's a joke oh goody goody yes jokes

5450.82 --> 5456.159
cause that's just [Â __Â ] great

5453.639 --> 5458.02
that's not annoying at all

5456.159 --> 5461.5
can it just have a conversation going

5458.02 --> 5465.6990000000005
instead of people just making jokes

5461.5 --> 5467.98
this is not comedy okay I am not a

5465.699 --> 5470.58
comedian

5467.98 --> 5470.58
chocolate

5475.0 --> 5479.199
foreign

5476.04 --> 5482.139
yeah sure things can be funny

5479.199 --> 5484.379999999999
but I am not a I'm not Owen Benjamin

5482.139 --> 5484.38
okay

5489.82 --> 5496.139
I'm not just here to make you laugh

5492.28 --> 5496.139
about whatever in the world

5501.0 --> 5505.8
man my mood is totally [Â __Â ] today

5517.06 --> 5523.2390000000005
oh Romulan s in Star Trek oh okay I

5520.78 --> 5525.58
thought you were said

5523.239 --> 5527.32
I thought you meant Roman basically

5525.58 --> 5528.699
yeah

5527.32 --> 5533.34
all right

5528.699 --> 5533.339999999999
but yeah the romulans are kind of like

5533.62 --> 5539.139
Roman elves

5536.739 --> 5541.959999999999
right Dusty Flint's they're like modern

5539.139 --> 5545.76
Roman now like that's kind of like their

5541.96 --> 5545.76
style within Star Trek

5548.26 --> 5553.54
so

5550.78 --> 5556.92
yeah they're gonna have symbols

5553.54 --> 5556.92
similarities to Rome

5569.62 --> 5573.84
yeah lighten up the vibe

5574.48 --> 5582.659
I'm not amused by that sort of humor

5578.26 --> 5586.900000000001
the one I think is funny actual really

5582.659 --> 5588.759999999999
complicated occult jokes I like it when

5586.9 --> 5590.739
there is a sentence that on the surface

5588.76 --> 5594.04
seems to work perfectly fine but when

5590.739 --> 5595.78
you look at it esoterically it reveals

5594.04 --> 5598.12
some kind of paradox

5595.78 --> 5600.099999999999
now that's my type of humor that's what

5598.12 --> 5602.139
makes me laugh where everybody's just

5600.1 --> 5604.3
there what what is he laughing at yeah

5602.139 --> 5607.6
that is funny to me you know what's

5604.3 --> 5610.5
funny to me that I get it and think it's

5607.6 --> 5614.639
really funny and nobody else gets it

5610.5 --> 5614.639
that actually makes me laugh

5628.179 --> 5632.679
and I guess some other people makes them

5630.52 --> 5636.4800000000005
laugh too when I don't get a job they

5632.679 --> 5636.4800000000005
think it's really funny well it's mutual

5646.3 --> 5651.900000000001
you're a fan of anti-umor what the hell

5648.88 --> 5651.900000000001
is that supposed to be

5664.42 --> 5667.42
foreign

5698.08 --> 5700.32
foreign

5706.66 --> 5710.5289999999995

[Music]

5732.94 --> 5735.94
foreign

5739.62 --> 5746.4
this noise is not some kind of a scooter

5742.54 --> 5746.4
that's just some stupid leaf blower

5759.04 --> 5762.239
right over there

5779.48 --> 5782.639999999999
[Music]

5784.179 --> 5788.9490000000005
what

5785.85 --> 5788.9490000000005
[Music]

5795.1 --> 5798.1
foreign

5799.34 --> 5806.59
[Music]

5810.0 --> 5815.92
wait it is

5812.38 --> 5818.02
book or electronic resource that lists

5815.92 --> 5819.97
words in groups

5818.02 --> 5823.119000000001
of synonyms

5819.97 --> 5823.119000000001
[Music]

5823.239 --> 5825.718999999999
huh

5825.82 --> 5829.62
I didn't know if that existed

5830.739 --> 5836.5
so it's like a book of synonyms

5834.28 --> 5839.58
so instead of alphabetical order it's

5836.5 --> 5842.729
synonym organized that's interesting

5839.58 --> 5842.729
[Music]

5853.84 --> 5859.92
no I'm not gonna do that my show is

5856.06 --> 5859.92
going to end in 10 minutes anyway Aries

5860.02 --> 5864.900000000001
why are you doing like that do you think

5862.54 --> 5864.9
it's funny

5870.94 --> 5876.099999999999
what you you think I I'm just some kind

5873.46 --> 5878.7390000000005
of a toy to like oh oh he's kind of

5876.1 --> 5881.620000000001
angry let's poke him so he gets angry

5878.739 --> 5884.739
yeah don't [Â __Â ] do that yeah

5881.62 --> 5888.0599999999995
I'm trying not to be angry

5884.739 --> 5888.0599999999995
it's not healthy for anything

5888.88 --> 5894.6990000000005
[Music]

5891.9 --> 5897.099999999999
I'm just trying to salvage whatever is

5894.699 --> 5899.0199999999995
left of this show this is already kind

5897.1 --> 5900.88
of shitty now

5899.02 --> 5902.620000000001
right but not gonna be anymore because

5900.88 --> 5905.08
this isn't gonna happen anymore because

5902.62 --> 5907.36
I banned Rasta hat again

5905.08 --> 5909.88
because he did exactly the same type of

5907.36 --> 5913.0199999999995
[Â __Â ] as last time

5909.88 --> 5913.02
and not having it anymore

5917.32 --> 5920.58
just like last time

[Music]

5937.84 --> 5940.84
foreign

5949.32 --> 5954.12
so anything else

5951.52 --> 5954.120000000001
guys

5955.9 --> 5960.46
10 more minutes but I could just round

5958.6 --> 5962.679
out the show right now I'm kind of eager

5960.46 --> 5965.699
to just round this show out I'm not

5962.679 --> 5965.6990000000005
gonna give it a title either

5968.44 --> 5970.62
foreign

5977.56 --> 5982.780000000001
I don't know but you stepped into

5979.96 --> 5987.719
something that made you get one and a

5982.78 --> 5987.719
one hour 50 minutes late see me Traveler

5988.12 --> 5993.76
but yeah everybody's getting all weird

5990.159 --> 5995.62
in chat being punny

5993.76 --> 5998.02
and other people

5995.62 --> 5999.76
yeah I got it in a fight and [Â __Â ] and

5998.02 --> 6002.219
there's the trolls I don't know what the

5999.76 --> 6005.280000000001
[Â __Â ] is wrong with everybody

6002.219 --> 6007.82
's going nuts today I know what the hell

6005.28 --> 6007.82
is going on

6011.3 --> 6017.820000000001
trying to restore it but people seem to

6014.219 --> 6019.9800000000005
be just continuing joking around trying

6017.82 --> 6022.0199999999995
to lighten the mood with jokes that I

6019.98 --> 6024.178999999999
don't really find funny especially when

6022.02 --> 6026.88
I'm pissed off I don't find that funny I

6024.179 --> 6029.82
just find it annoying

6026.88 --> 6031.62
and other people just getting on my

6029.82 --> 6033.98
nerves I don't know what the hell is

6031.62 --> 6033.98
going on

6039.179 --> 6042.86
didn't make enough esoterics yeah that's

6041.94 --> 6046.58
right

6042.86 --> 6046.58
esoteric jokes are funny

6056.3 --> 6061.62
but no I'm not a guy that's easily

6059.219 --> 6064.02
distracted towards jokes when I'm pissed

6061.62 --> 6067.739
off it doesn't work with me

6064.02 --> 6069.96
what works with me is it being resolved

6067.739 --> 6071.5199999999995
that works with me

6069.96 --> 6074.219
and if it can't

6071.52 --> 6078.06
just let it go and just

6074.219 --> 6081.659
don't try to be funny when sorry for

6078.06 --> 6084.3
being like this I mean in general I mean

6081.659 --> 6087.0
when I'm actually agitated trying to be

6084.3 --> 6089.400000000001
funny like a clown it annoys me it

6087.0 --> 6092.76
doesn't actually distract me

6089.4 --> 6095.58
when I'm like that it doesn't work

6092.76 --> 6098.52
may work afterward after I'm obviously

6095.58 --> 6100.739
having let it go then I might be like oh

6098.52 --> 6102.659000000001
huh right

6100.739 --> 6104.459999999999
but that's the love we can go it could

6102.659 --> 6106.5
be superficial haha

6104.46 --> 6109.619
when I'm pissed off I'm not going to be

6106.5 --> 6110.76
like oh oh wow what an opportunity of a

6109.619 --> 6114.36
joke to destroy

6110.76 --> 6115.619000000001
destroyed from my Angry yeah I don't do

6114.36 --> 6118.88
that

6115.619 --> 6118.88
I just don't

6129.38 --> 6133.86
not every show is a winner perseverance

6132.36 --> 6136.08
yeah yeah

6133.86 --> 6138.48
well I'm actually just blaming myself

6136.08 --> 6140.76
for drinking that one beer it's

6138.48 --> 6143.82
really bizarre

6140.76 --> 6146.159000000001
right how the entire mood everything

6143.82 --> 6149.4
just rearranged somehow I don't even

6146.159 --> 6151.138999999999
feel that different but just everything

6149.4 --> 6152.94
works different

6151.139 --> 6156.119
so let's hope that doesn't happen

6152.94 --> 6158.099999999999
tomorrow I'm not gonna drink today not

6156.119 --> 6160.46
even gonna go out for groceries I don't

6158.1 --> 6160.46
need to

6161.04 --> 6163.94
but uh

6164.82 --> 6169.86
yeah you seem to be in a much more

6167.159 --> 6170.638999999999
focused mood so that's welcome in the

6169.86 --> 6172.799999999999
chat

6170.639 --> 6174.78
it's literally how that's rubbing off on

6172.8 --> 6176.9400000000005
me yeah if somebody's actually focused

6174.78 --> 6179.099999999999
and not in a terrible mood

6176.94 --> 6181.5599999999995
that rubs off on me

6179.1 --> 6184.5
just as much as when somebody's actually

6181.56 --> 6186.659000000001
really in a [Â __Â ] up mood even if

6184.5 --> 6188.699
they're suppressing it

6186.659 --> 6191.54
so yeah very welcome to have you here

6188.699 --> 6191.54
Stevie Traveler

6192.48 --> 6199.379999999999
did you buy just one beer yeah yesterday

6195.32 --> 6204.199
yeah just one half liter

6199.38 --> 6204.1990000000005
and I drank it during a pizza

6205.5 --> 6213.179
I barely even like got Tipsy of it

6210.119 --> 6216.299999999999
but I did find it kind of enjoyable

6213.179 --> 6220.28
I did I did actually just enjoy it I

6216.3 --> 6220.28
didn't even want more after that one so

6221.58 --> 6226.8
but yeah still it does something with me

6224.04 --> 6230.639
it just does

6226.8 --> 6233.04
it changes the way the spiritual Supple

6230.639 --> 6235.139
subtle energies work it just does and

6233.04 --> 6236.4
well I guess you could consider today as

6235.139 --> 6238.02
proof of that

6236.4 --> 6238.92
because all kinds of things went wrong

6238.02 --> 6241.080000000001
today

6238.92 --> 6244.52
in the chat

6241.08 --> 6244.5199999999995
I'm not pissed off again

6244.98 --> 6251.159
harass the Hat although yeah that was a

6247.86 --> 6253.86
thing that was hanging in there

6251.159 --> 6255.659
but it's just the attitude I mean when

6253.86 --> 6258.0599999999995
somebody does that

6255.659 --> 6260.78
and they give attitude I'm immediately

6258.06 --> 6260.780000000001
done with it

6260.84 --> 6266.34
I'm just done with that

6263.159 --> 6268.138999999999
like that's not the way to had to

6266.34 --> 6272.3
interact with me ever

6268.139 --> 6272.3
I do not accept ever

6276.06 --> 6283.1990000000005
not on the internet not out there

6279.619 --> 6286.619
especially not out there I do not accept

6283.199 --> 6288.119
friends supposed friends or people in

6286.619 --> 6291.0
general

6288.119 --> 6293.48
treating me like that

6291.0 --> 6293.48
ever

6294.199 --> 6300.199
not even once all right good on you

6297.9 --> 6303.0
Aries 106.

6300.199 --> 6304.0199999999995
don't be I'm not beating myself up over

6303.0 --> 6306.96
one

6304.02 --> 6311.219
I did enjoy it I'm just noticing like

6306.96 --> 6313.679
hey there is some kind of influence

6311.219 --> 6316.26
negative and it's

6313.679 --> 6320.6
it's kind of bizarre

6316.26 --> 6320.6
what that little bit just does

6323.78 --> 6329.159
like it's a subtle influence it's not

6326.219 --> 6331.679
like oh I got I got issues with my tummy

6329.159 --> 6335.159
again or something or I don't feel well

6331.679 --> 6340.08
I got a headache no it's not it's like

6335.159 --> 6342.239
the way energy flows even between us it

6340.08 --> 6345.98
just somehow Works slightly differently

6342.239 --> 6345.98
that's what I'm noticing

6348.659 --> 6354.96
like the next day it works differently

6351.6 --> 6356.639
now of course yeah what would today have

6354.96 --> 6358.44
been like if I hadn't drank it will

6356.639 --> 6361.34
probably work different it would have

6358.44 --> 6361.339999999999
been a different show

6363.02 --> 6369.9800000000005
with me more focused less angry

6367.26 --> 6369.9800000000005
I think

6370.739 --> 6374.94
right so

6372.48 --> 6376.44
I'll just take it as a reminder as to

6374.94 --> 6377.78
just not

6376.44 --> 6379.138999999999
do that

6377.78 --> 6380.759999999999
[Music]

6379.139 --> 6383.58
or maybe

6380.76 --> 6385.9800000000005
yeah I mean if I had like one day off

6383.58 --> 6388.5
where I don't do an early bird show

6385.98 --> 6390.739
then I might just like drink the day

6388.5 --> 6390.739
before

6390.84 --> 6396.54
and then yeah it's not gonna ruin the

6393.239 --> 6401.099999999999
show but yeah I don't want to not do a

6396.54 --> 6403.0199999999995
show on a day so alcohol's just gotta go

6401.1 --> 6405.38
well that was the original plan anyway

6403.02 --> 6405.38
but

6406.02 --> 6409.8
still testing always testing figuring

6408.6 --> 6411.84
out

6409.8 --> 6415.5
finding a balance finding out what is

6411.84 --> 6418.1990000000005
real what did what things really do

6415.5 --> 6420.6
it's what I do figuring out what things

6418.199 --> 6422.638999999999
really do to me

6420.6 --> 6426.56
and out there

6422.639 --> 6426.56
that's yeah what I'm all about

6426.78 --> 6432.36
right so I'm gonna round out the show

6429.719 --> 6434.219
thanks everyone for coming this to this

6432.36 --> 6436.199
rowdy

6434.219 --> 6439.5
show

6436.199 --> 6441.96
the yeah some drama I guess

6439.5 --> 6445.699
I try to avoid that in general but yeah

6441.96 --> 6445.699
when it happens it just happens and

6446.28 --> 6449.88
whatever

6448.08 --> 6451.86
if you want to see a really good early

6449.88 --> 6454.08
bird show watch my show from yesterday

6451.86 --> 6455.82
and the day before

6454.08 --> 6458.42
that's me

6455.82 --> 6458.42
peaking

6458.94 --> 6464.46
right this is my more Rowdy side I guess

6461.52 --> 6466.4400000000005
it's due to alcoholic influence it can

6464.46 --> 6468.42
make me a bit more rowdy

6466.44 --> 6470.96
it's just the way it works apparently

6468.42 --> 6470.96
right

6474.179 --> 6478.46
okay Dusty I didn't know that but

6478.619 --> 6483.0

don't be outraged when you don't

6530.94 --> 6536.58
actually do that for whatever reason

6533.58 --> 6539.4
don't be outraged that I'm disappointed

6536.58 --> 6541.08
and maybe a little agitated about it

6539.4 --> 6542.5199999999995
yeah

6541.08 --> 6545.34
just don't

6542.52 --> 6547.8
don't do that

6545.34 --> 6550.139
and then things will be all right I mean

6547.8 --> 6553.8
it's okay things can't always work out

6550.139 --> 6556.1990000000005
right but if you're gonna have attitude

6553.8 --> 6558.659000000001
to work me like why are you like I'm

6556.199 --> 6561.419999999999
helping you why why are you giving me

6558.659 --> 6564.119
this attitude yeah because you gave me a

6561.42 --> 6566.46
false promise and I really need the

6564.119 --> 6569.179
support so I'm gonna count on things

6566.46 --> 6572.34
like somebody's word

6569.179 --> 6575.659
literally to get by and be able to eat

6572.34 --> 6578.82
okay so it's important

6575.659 --> 6582.0
somebody's word is very important to me

6578.82 --> 6584.699
because of my situation

6582.0 --> 6586.44
so expect people that when they say they

6584.699 --> 6588.299999999999
are gonna support me that they're

6586.44 --> 6590.04
actually going to support me and not

6588.3 --> 6593.06
give me lip

6590.04 --> 6593.06
when they don't

6593.34 --> 6597.719
because if that's gonna be the way it is

6595.56 --> 6599.76
then I don't want your support I want

6597.719 --> 6603.3
you to stay the [Â __Â ] away from me with

6599.76 --> 6604.38
your false promises that are ruining my

6603.3 --> 6606.96
function

6604.38 --> 6609.96
it's that simple

6606.96 --> 6611.58
all right so anyway I'll be back

6609.96 --> 6614.4800000000005
