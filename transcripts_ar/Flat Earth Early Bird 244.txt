70.75 --> 76.86
weather today is a little better no ring

74.41 --> 84.789
really but there are some really sturdy

76.86 --> 88.81
clouds out there still bit moist not

84.789 --> 93.31
cold but that's still too cold to sit

88.81 --> 97.54
around in my t-shirt it's not bad not

93.31 --> 103.84
windy so I got with me

97.54 --> 106.0
no edibles but tomorrow coffee tea and

103.84 --> 113.95
lemonade I don't know if I'm gonna drink

106.0 --> 116.52
this but see how are you all doing it's

113.95 --> 124.5
my volume good

116.52 --> 126.53999999999999
that's okay all right now know the

124.5 --> 130.16
volume is still at the same setting I

126.54 --> 134.4
really don't get this program okay

130.16 --> 139.19
anyway all is good with me I hope with

134.4 --> 142.92000000000002
you guys as well let's see who is here

139.19 --> 145.65
so set it out with professional tea

142.92 --> 148.16
sensible was very annoying and starting

145.65 --> 150.33
to regurgitate more Coriolis stuff

148.16 --> 154.049
explicitly asked him not to

150.33 --> 164.01000000000002
so I ban him then a GM came in stone

154.049 --> 171.56900000000002
monkey 3d Steve Jacobs air Jacko the

164.01 --> 175.48899999999998
mark colored Fyodor Dostoevsky flat-out

171.569 --> 175.48899999999998
faith good to see you

181.18 --> 190.23000000000002
did it save what summer what fyodor

184.709 --> 190.23
dostoyevsky oh hello parish Mike as well

192.03 --> 195.06
[Music]

195.84 --> 206.409
so yeah a bit of a list just been

204.43 --> 209.56
thinking in general I have been having

206.409 --> 218.2
some discussions about code of conducts

209.56 --> 219.849
according in relation to myself and I'm

218.2 --> 221.85899999999998
just starting to think more like what

219.849 --> 227.47
really happened with the situation the

221.859 --> 229.989
other day the past I basically what I

227.47 --> 233.079
did is I passed a judgement of some kind

229.989 --> 234.67000000000002
but you know people have expressed their

233.079 --> 237.269
opinions all the time it's not

234.67 --> 239.58999999999997
necessarily passing judgments just like

237.269 --> 242.34
when it really comes down to it it's

239.59 --> 245.95000000000002
their opinion but when you take on a

242.34 --> 249.37
professional opinion and then you are

245.95 --> 254.76899999999998
claiming basically yeah a body of

249.37 --> 260.079
authority that will give it more weight

254.769 --> 262.12
I guess and that it's interesting

260.079 --> 263.979
because I started to think about what I

262.12 --> 267.24
said in the Bible about judgment that

263.979 --> 270.729
should leave the judgment of God and

267.24 --> 273.34000000000003
then let me think like maybe that is it

270.729 --> 275.59
it's not about people's opinions and

273.34 --> 277.98999999999995
people don't necessarily take that as

275.59 --> 281.10999999999996
judgement they could but it's the it's

277.99 --> 283.87
the weight that makes the judgment real

281.11 --> 286.91900000000004
as it were that it could have real

283.87 --> 292.56
consequences that is the judgment and

286.919 --> 295.35999999999996
when that happens it has to have yea

292.56 --> 297.19
sufficient it has to have the right

295.36 --> 302.889
frequency it has to have the right

297.19 --> 305.91
timing or it will dis innate the yeah it

302.889 --> 311.56
will call it caused dissonance with

305.91 --> 315.76000000000005
well with everyone involved or well at

311.56 --> 319.81
least everyone looking upon it so maybe

315.76 --> 321.61
that is the effect and I don't claim

319.81 --> 323.23
Authority by the way concerning

321.61 --> 324.93
psychology I always say I'm a layman

323.23 --> 331.09000000000003
it's just like a hobby of mine

324.93 --> 334.18
but I should not secretly try to pull in

331.09 --> 337.69
weight back into it and I think that is

334.18 --> 341.02
what I may have liked unconsciously been

337.69 --> 343.3
doing a little because it really doesn't

341.02 --> 348.45
have all that much weight the way

343.3 --> 348.45
psychology designates certain disorders

349.11 --> 355.35
it's weird because in my kind of laymen

353.2 --> 357.84999999999997
experience with it

355.35 --> 360.34000000000003
concerning psychology it's mostly like

357.85 --> 365.25
getting the system into some kind of

360.34 --> 365.25
format getting that correct but it's

365.88 --> 374.32
it's not necessarily implied even on how

369.52 --> 378.15
to fix it that's the weird thing about

374.32 --> 382.42
it it I've never found real psychology

378.15 --> 385.81
constructive by default by its system as

382.42 --> 388.39000000000004
it were it's just like a way to kind of

385.81 --> 392.26
put things into boxes and it can kind of

388.39 --> 396.84
work but it's been muddied up and well

392.26 --> 400.36
obviously politicized in certain fronts

396.84 --> 402.96999999999997
so it really isn't all that reliable and

400.36 --> 408.6
it's kind of silly that I kind of took

402.97 --> 413.44000000000005
that wait like yeah I basically

408.6 --> 415.66
overlooked that as I started to declare

413.44 --> 420.94
that and that was stupid of me that's

415.66 --> 424.98
poor judgment of the situation by myself

420.94 --> 428.38
so maybe that refines it a bit better

424.98 --> 430.57
you know it's to me it's very important

428.38 --> 433.81
to really get to the root of my own

430.57 --> 435.02
mistakes because I hate actually making

433.81 --> 438.02
mistakes

435.02 --> 441.40999999999997
the ones that have consequences I hate

438.02 --> 443.99
it so I like every time even something

441.41 --> 448.31
remotely happens like that I just want

443.99 --> 452.54
to absolutely refine it until the core

448.31 --> 454.16
is exposed so that I'm not gonna fall

452.54 --> 456.82
for that kind of thing again I'm not

454.16 --> 465.44
gonna overlook it again

456.82 --> 468.14
so learning is important all right all

465.44 --> 472.46
right so that's a bit about the judgment

468.14 --> 476.09
part and it's very complex how real

472.46 --> 478.46
judgment works like when you're on the

476.09 --> 480.71
right frequency and in the right time

478.46 --> 483.59
then every a lot of people will just

480.71 --> 485.33
agree naturally even though they might

483.59 --> 488.47999999999996
be in disagreements about many things

485.33 --> 492.59
even with each other and with you that's

488.48 --> 497.29
the the way that's like I can the real

492.59 --> 497.28999999999996
resonating truth as it were

497.56 --> 503.75
you could almost consider that like the

501.17 --> 509.69
frequency of God maybe that is God's

503.75 --> 512.84
judgment when everybody just knows maybe

509.69 --> 515.06
that is God's judgment so you shouldn't

512.84 --> 518.33
judge you should leave the judgment to

515.06 --> 521.51
God that's weird though because yeah

518.33 --> 524.89
look people that are completely deluded

521.51 --> 529.49
can also agree almost like the devil is

524.89 --> 533.3
basically speaking through them so yeah

529.49 --> 541.33
a group consensus is not a guarantee for

533.3 --> 543.9399999999999
a god judgment result so it is oh yeah

541.33 --> 548.3000000000001
thanks for that flat after Judge neat

543.94 --> 551.1400000000001
judge not yet ye be judged right

548.3 --> 551.14
something like that

565.42 --> 573.11
no but look judge and when I say judge

569.57 --> 576.08
I'm not like necessarily even meet me

573.11 --> 580.07
I'm meaning the I'm taking another

576.08 --> 585.5600000000001
approach to the God not necessarily as

580.07 --> 589.46
the designer spirit more as his answer

585.56 --> 593.51
within creation because I think that God

589.46 --> 599.27
has answers within creation you know

593.51 --> 602.5699999999999
what's right by what happens to you in

599.27 --> 606.86
response to what you do and so in this

602.57 --> 610.1600000000001
case when you basically try to analyze

606.86 --> 617.39
something then God will judge by the

610.16 --> 621.37
response as it were that's how you how

617.39 --> 625.39
you know you you got it right

621.37 --> 625.39
does that make any sense to you guys

627.96 --> 634.08
like I think often that through people

632.28 --> 638.24
and I'm not specifically talking about

634.08 --> 641.82
myself but in general like God or

638.24 --> 647.73
aspects of God like more angelic type

641.82 --> 650.25
the things impulses ideas frequencies

647.73 --> 652.5600000000001
can express themselves through regular

650.25 --> 656.43
people depending on their nature on

652.56 --> 659.3399999999999
their natural base frequencies what they

656.43 --> 661.0799999999999
are hold then just the impulse can

659.34 --> 663.9
manifest like God speaks through

661.08 --> 666.36
somebody else can be incredible I've

663.9 --> 669.84
seen incredible things and expressed

666.36 --> 673.17
incredible things like that that's just

669.84 --> 675.48
weird situations that are just surreal

673.17 --> 680.04
when I'm basically just there and

675.48 --> 681.8100000000001
suddenly I catch on because like and I'm

680.04 --> 684.36
talking very young because I used to be

681.81 --> 686.4799999999999
just very dreamy you know very

684.36 --> 688.98
absent-minded always in my mind

686.48 --> 691.73
sometimes I would just catch up on the

688.98 --> 696.9300000000001
situation around me and then subtly

691.73 --> 699.54
insert all this information and really

696.93 --> 708.78
insanely quick instant analysis almost

699.54 --> 711.39
and that yeah that was weird but I I

708.78 --> 717.6
can't even attribute that to like oh I

711.39 --> 720.66
did that it's like it overcame me so it

717.6 --> 724.1700000000001
feels like maybe that is God then using

720.66 --> 726.7199999999999
me as a vessel to express itself and I

724.17 --> 730.62
don't say oh that makes me special no I

726.72 --> 734.13
think that a lot of people have this but

730.62 --> 735.75
they just it's normal this is part of

734.13 --> 738.63
Hume and we consider that part of

735.75 --> 741.18
humanity just as what happens when

738.63 --> 743.4
people get really in the darkness and

741.18 --> 745.9699999999999
just start to behave demonically that's

743.4 --> 749.37
also a uniform and we also kind of

745.97 --> 752.3000000000001
attribute that to human beings but that

749.37 --> 757.34
clear those are clearly Luciferian and

752.3 --> 760.88
aromanian or demonic if you unify it

757.34 --> 769.11
influences that also have there

760.88 --> 774.59
their entrance be within us so that is

769.11 --> 774.59
kind of like how I see humans now mostly

777.44 --> 783.74
it's weird it's kind of like segregating

780.43 --> 785.4799999999999
elements within the within the natural

783.74 --> 791.72
human expression

785.48 --> 796.16
I guess it's almost a new form of

791.72 --> 799.48
psychology at it almost more realistic

796.16 --> 802.8389999999999
maybe a little oversimplified form of

799.48 --> 808.48
psychological approach using

802.839 --> 811.339
reintroducing divinity in some way it's

808.48 --> 816.1
I'm just I'm just doing what I'm doing

811.339 --> 821.0
and this is kind of based really on the

816.1 --> 823.16
on the Rudolf Steiner lore and what I

821.0 --> 826.879
learned from my healer no it does things

823.16 --> 829.129
and he's still kind of dynamic in it as

826.879 --> 832.8100000000001
well because I really took over the

829.129 --> 836.509
aromanian and Luciferian you know words

832.81 --> 839.779
but now he seems to have for some reason

836.509 --> 842.66
decided some time ago that he just

839.779 --> 845.81
rather call them demons mostly because

842.66 --> 847.24
the actual Luciferian spirit rarely

845.81 --> 850.3699999999999
rears its head

847.24 --> 852.949
it's very man you get to see most of the

850.37 --> 854.779
time in these days and that's also kind

852.949 --> 856.8499999999999
of like in the charts apparently like

854.779 --> 860.029
this is an age where every man goes to

856.85 --> 863.0790000000001
grow stronger and the Dark One's grow

860.029 --> 863.079
more mad

865.11 --> 870.149
[Music]

876.83 --> 883.76
so let's see if we can get back to earth

881.31 --> 883.76
a bit

893.97 --> 903.179
oh yeah I have you seen the lunar land

897.569 --> 905.909
oh god I gotta show you this usually I

903.179 --> 907.47
leave this guy damn you I leave these

905.909 --> 910.47
kind of things to the Flat Earth debates

907.47 --> 914.4490000000001
but now I'm gonna just present that

910.47 --> 914.4490000000001
because they're just thinkin Solaris oh

916.549 --> 924.809
yeah also I make yeah I'm gonna get a

922.979 --> 928.979
little deeper into the concept of flying

924.809 --> 931.799
cities as well and the pyramids I talked

928.979 --> 934.5590000000001
about that I'll try to lay it out anyway

931.799 --> 939.749
some moon landing supposedly that's

934.559 --> 946.009
gonna happen now uh hold on with India's

939.749 --> 952.309
doing it this time so look at that

946.009 --> 952.309
that's just that's just special

953.58 --> 957.23
let's see if I can

959.019 --> 968.29
why can't i zoom into that dammit

970.11 --> 979.6800000000001
all right so yeah that thing is just

976.47 --> 982.02
funny and oh my God look is this

979.68 --> 990.4499999999999
supposed to be like the capsule there

982.02 --> 993.93
let me just zoom in it's just so bizarre

990.45 --> 996.9200000000001
to me it almost looks like like some

993.93 --> 1002.75
kind of Legos or something it's just

996.92 --> 1008.29
look at that this thing it that's

1002.75 --> 1008.29
supposed to hold that are they serious

1008.89 --> 1018.35
looks like is like one of those

1014.72 --> 1021.83
chocolate eggs with a little play toy

1018.35 --> 1025.3
inside seriously look at it only thing

1021.83 --> 1028.91
that's missing is the chocolate toppings

1025.3 --> 1031.6299999999999
what the that's supposed to be launched

1028.91 --> 1031.63
in space

1035.71 --> 1046.72
yeah a kinder egg indeed this is so

1040.78 --> 1049.03
funny to me because yeah I remember even

1046.72 --> 1053.17
those things that I liked as a kid kind

1049.03 --> 1054.8799999999999
of before I got that and that's

1053.17 --> 1058.8100000000002
typically one of the things they put a

1054.88 --> 1062.0200000000002
stupid little toys in but yeah they put

1058.81 --> 1065.3799999999999
in little moon Landers and astronauts in

1062.02 --> 1068.3799999999999
there as well I think at some time it

1065.38 --> 1075.0400000000002
probably did at some point or they might

1068.38 --> 1077.3100000000002
do that again I don't know it's just so

1075.04 --> 1077.31
silly

1088.21 --> 1097.33
what makes a gen dry an to special I

1094.15 --> 1097.3300000000002
love it

1099.4 --> 1112.97
let's see I could take a look at what

1102.29 --> 1116.02
they show that's 45 seconds oh no that's

1112.97 --> 1116.02
not gonna work

1124.33 --> 1127.33
okay

1141.73 --> 1157.22
okay I can't believe that's it that's I

1148.93 --> 1159.79
can't believe that was it I just I I'm

1157.22 --> 1159.79
just baffled

1168.79 --> 1173.02
anyway yeah that's supposed to be

1170.8 --> 1174.97
happening really soon and India's

1173.02 --> 1181.12
getting all excited about it so we'll

1174.97 --> 1185.64
see you know Israel supposedly had their

1181.12 --> 1188.9499999999998
little moon crash landing so they say

1185.64 --> 1190.8400000000001
remember that now India is doing it it's

1188.95 --> 1192.49
all the rage everybody's gonna send

1190.84 --> 1198.55
their moon lander it's a race to the

1192.49 --> 1201.69
moon it's the moon race apparently now

1198.55 --> 1204.31
everybody wants to fake a moon landing

1201.69 --> 1206.26
it's all the rage everybody's talking

1204.31 --> 1207.79
about the fake moon landing so all the

1206.26 --> 1210.19
countries just want to get some

1207.79 --> 1215.44
attention like oh yeah we we can fake a

1210.19 --> 1220.03
moon landing too you know we're special

1215.44 --> 1223.75
too we have snow flakes we have Bob

1220.03 --> 1226.69
leavers zealots now we're not just the

1223.75 --> 1231.64
old religious fanatics we also have our

1226.69 --> 1234.24
ballers see they love this [ __ ] so

1231.64 --> 1234.24
creative

1247.92 --> 1258.72
ah all right so let's get to some sci-fi

1252.57 --> 1260.85
tech stuff yeah I Elia made the

1258.72 --> 1262.74
connections when we're talking there was

1260.85 --> 1264.3
talk about pyramid I don't even remember

1262.74 --> 1270.45
where it was was it on the flatter

1264.3 --> 1272.76
Debates probably or was it in in some

1270.45 --> 1274.77
after-show probably I think I had to

1272.76 --> 1277.83
talk with added I remember Adam was

1274.77 --> 1281.31
there and he addressed it I think it was

1277.83 --> 1283.9499999999998
Adam I'm not sure anymore anyway I had

1281.31 --> 1286.62
the idea that due to the structure of

1283.95 --> 1288.69
pyramids there's all these interesting

1286.62 --> 1291.08
effects about it you know it's like even

1288.69 --> 1297.38
measured like okay because of structure

1291.08 --> 1302.6699999999998
so these weird electrical consequences

1297.38 --> 1307.0200000000002
okay and there seems to be some energy

1302.67 --> 1309.0600000000002
projected upwards right above the cap of

1307.02 --> 1312.48
it and this is even can be miniaturized

1309.06 --> 1314.85
and explained that if you have a bottle

1312.48 --> 1316.68
of water and you put a one of those

1314.85 --> 1318.78
pyramids underneath and you put that set

1316.68 --> 1321.1200000000001
up in the freezer that the water doesn't

1318.78 --> 1324.3
freeze because it is somehow energized

1321.12 --> 1326.85
like that fascinating so that means it

1324.3 --> 1329.52
really is some kind of influence that

1326.85 --> 1331.8899999999999
does something that has an energy and I

1329.52 --> 1336.15
have already extrapolated from that how

1331.89 --> 1338.64
I believe that the Atlanteans had giants

1336.15 --> 1341.7900000000002
among that them that basically

1338.64 --> 1344.13
physically fed on that energy created by

1341.79 --> 1348.48
the pyramids that were basically Hydra

1344.13 --> 1352.44
LED electric Tesla like high frequency

1348.48 --> 1355.56
energy generators that would just create

1352.44 --> 1358.1100000000001
a life benefiting energy field to which

1355.56 --> 1359.82
the Giants were specifically adapted in

1358.11 --> 1362.04
your phraseology so they wouldn't starve

1359.82 --> 1364.59
to death and then they could help build

1362.04 --> 1366.36
those pyramids as well so it was really

1364.59 --> 1369.6599999999999
part of their society I think it was

1366.36 --> 1372.9499999999998
they're like like Giants need pyramids

1369.66 --> 1372.95
really I think

1373.17 --> 1379.0900000000001
anyway unless they want to be ravenous

1375.58 --> 1380.08
beasts constantly eating everything so

1379.09 --> 1384.1599999999999
that was that

1380.08 --> 1388.0
part and I came up with that three years

1384.16 --> 1390.6100000000001
ago like even flatter talks talk about

1388.0 --> 1392.95
the Atlantean age look it up look up

1390.61 --> 1400.03
that hang out it I'm amazed how well

1392.95 --> 1402.46
that that held held together uh but now

1400.03 --> 1406.75
is thinking okay there's also talk about

1402.46 --> 1410.2
flying cities and that's on another page

1406.75 --> 1413.83
like here now I don't have the originals

1410.2 --> 1417.82
of course but apparently in Indian

1413.83 --> 1422.1699999999998
mythology or so they say there's a thing

1417.82 --> 1430.53
called the vimana and that is this it's

1422.17 --> 1436.1200000000001
a flying City let's see if I can write

1430.53 --> 1441.51
let's make that a little bigger so this

1436.12 --> 1441.51
thing right there

1443.58 --> 1450.78
and yeah that's very also this glow

1447.72 --> 1452.31
surrounding it you know and and one hand

1450.78 --> 1455.58
you could think okay they could be a

1452.31 --> 1457.95
holographic projection could be very fun

1455.58 --> 1459.6
to do but there's also just a lot of

1457.95 --> 1463.77
descriptions in those writings about

1459.6 --> 1467.0
actual physical interactions so what if

1463.77 --> 1470.01
there were some kind of electromagnetic

1467.0 --> 1474.38
levitating the yeah mechanisms that

1470.01 --> 1479.34
enable very large objects like buildings

1474.38 --> 1482.3400000000001
building size or maybe entire islands to

1479.34 --> 1486.03
float and be steered around like ships

1482.34 --> 1489.57
it's an amazing thought I'd say I used

1486.03 --> 1491.61
that concept or I I will use that I

1489.57 --> 1493.8
haven't used that concept in a small

1491.61 --> 1498.6599999999999
sense even in my DD games because it's

1493.8 --> 1500.9099999999999
just awesome but yeah they're the indeed

1498.66 --> 1503.6100000000001
didn't came up didn't come up with it

1500.91 --> 1505.92
it's a an ancient concept in those

1503.61 --> 1507.51
writings and I think okay if those

1505.92 --> 1509.28
things would be floating around and they

1507.51 --> 1512.79
would probably be electromagnetically

1509.28 --> 1514.59
driven somehow must be still like the

1512.79 --> 1517.2
only wake we can think of now to even

1514.59 --> 1520.5
accomplish anything remotely in that

1517.2 --> 1522.3300000000002
direction so they worked it out but that

1520.5 --> 1525.72
thing's gonna need some kind of energy

1522.33 --> 1527.79
so then I thought okay pyramids pyramids

1525.72 --> 1530.13
around the world during the Atlantean

1527.79 --> 1533.94
Age right Atlantean Age should probably

1530.13 --> 1537.45
be that age right age of the floating

1533.94 --> 1542.5800000000002
cities weird mythological creatures

1537.45 --> 1545.28
giants perhaps in other regions and well

1542.58 --> 1548.82
maybe those flying cities were actually

1545.28 --> 1551.67
compatible with pyramids that they could

1548.82 --> 1557.6699999999998
use them as docking stations float above

1551.67 --> 1561.99
them and sit let's see like you have to

1557.67 --> 1564.6000000000001
pyramid and they can just sit right in

1561.99 --> 1568.34
the top energy field of that and load

1564.6 --> 1568.34
themselves like a docking station

1568.67 --> 1575.3600000000001
you know charge almost like a Tesla card

1572.68 --> 1577.8200000000002
you plug it in but instead of plugging

1575.36 --> 1584.6899999999998
it in it just floats and sits on top of

1577.82 --> 1587.12
a pyramid it seems very easy once you

1584.69 --> 1590.8600000000001
accomplish these these structures to

1587.12 --> 1593.7199999999998
make that compatible why not

1590.86 --> 1595.58
seems more sensible than just letting it

1593.72 --> 1597.59
run out of energy and then land or

1595.58 --> 1600.9499999999998
something and then charge it back up

1597.59 --> 1604.03
again better to just have docking

1600.95 --> 1606.92
stations to keep it floating permanently

1604.03 --> 1614.83
well what better way than the permanent

1606.92 --> 1614.8300000000002
energy source like a pyramid you know

1616.92 --> 1635.88
Lu so yeah that was not a concept that I

1625.92 --> 1640.3700000000001
wanted to share for a moment sure BJ

1635.88 --> 1640.3700000000001
sure of course

1640.82 --> 1646.6799999999998
right that makes full sense but look

1644.13 --> 1652.19
even if they were okay even if those

1646.68 --> 1654.27
pyramids were actually built somehow my

1652.19 --> 1657.81
whatever powers that be

1654.27 --> 1660.18
might our Terrans maybe even there are

1657.81 --> 1663.48
pyramids also everywhere around the

1660.18 --> 1665.25
world it's like Star Wars there are star

1663.48 --> 1669.06
wars all over the place but there are

1665.25 --> 1672.0
also a lot of pyramids around and in

1669.06 --> 1673.85
insane locations like at the bottom of

1672.0 --> 1678.69
lakes and oceans

1673.85 --> 1681.51
so yeah pyramids were there whether this

1678.69 --> 1685.3200000000002
specific pyramid was falsified

1681.51 --> 1687.48
somehow you tell me how how in a few

1685.32 --> 1689.57
hundred years ago they built pyramids at

1687.48 --> 1695.8700000000001
the freaking bottom of lakes and oceans

1689.57 --> 1695.87
you know I'm just saying

1698.52 --> 1705.94
okay the genuine ones sure look I don't

1702.91 --> 1710.16
know too much about the Giza pyramid you

1705.94 --> 1714.0700000000002
know maybe it was a throwback tent

1710.16 --> 1716.65
somehow like maybe it was a Territorian

1714.07 --> 1720.58
attempt to kind of get try to

1716.65 --> 1722.68
reconstruct the the Atlantean pyramid

1720.58 --> 1727.1499999999999
structures to kind of try to achieve

1722.68 --> 1730.72
like a Tesla Tower in that sense who

1727.15 --> 1733.18
knows maybe now that actually kind of

1730.72 --> 1735.63
makes sense if you're gonna draw into

1733.18 --> 1740.6200000000001
doubt that the pyramids were ancient

1735.63 --> 1743.47
specifically the Giza pyramids then what

1740.62 --> 1745.12
period could they have possibly achieved

1743.47 --> 1747.94
it well in a period where they could

1745.12 --> 1751.62
potentially levitate and still mold

1747.94 --> 1754.63
stone to quickly build huge structures

1751.62 --> 1756.6699999999998
they wouldn't even necessarily need

1754.63 --> 1758.44
giants specifically it would be a little

1756.67 --> 1760.63
tougher so they would definitely have

1758.44 --> 1763.69
not built all the freaking pyramids like

1760.63 --> 1766.3500000000001
that that's ridiculous I would take way

1763.69 --> 1769.6000000000001
too much effort

1766.35 --> 1770.34
so maybe the Giza pyramids were a more

1769.6 --> 1773.34
recent

1770.34 --> 1781.4399999999998
tartarean attempt to reconstruct an

1773.34 --> 1781.4399999999998
Atlantean pyramid maybe

1790.51 --> 1793.65
oh yeah

1797.78 --> 1807.56
yeah it also very much depends on how

1800.75 --> 1809.87
well were they able to use the sonar or

1807.56 --> 1811.94
the electromagnetic whatever trickery

1809.87 --> 1813.7099999999998
they're going to use the stone molding

1811.94 --> 1818.39
technique how could they for example

1813.71 --> 1820.58
fuse rocks back together seamlessly like

1818.39 --> 1824.8100000000002
they were one without leaving some kind

1820.58 --> 1826.9099999999999
of visual traces because then you could

1824.81 --> 1830.45
and this probably has been done already

1826.91 --> 1833.8100000000002
you could analyze the largest sizes

1830.45 --> 1837.4
sized blocks within the pyramid because

1833.81 --> 1840.3799999999999
I think in the inside are very large

1837.4 --> 1841.91
rocks of specific types of like pink

1840.38 --> 1845.9
granite and that kind of thing

1841.91 --> 1848.18
not small ones but were they originally

1845.9 --> 1851.21
once one piece where they mold it in

1848.18 --> 1854.0600000000002
like that or where they literally cut

1851.21 --> 1857.03
out because when you have unified cut

1854.06 --> 1861.02
out giant chunks that's a sign that's

1857.03 --> 1863.66
probably Giants at work because yeah

1861.02 --> 1866.33
would they be able to just cut them up

1863.66 --> 1868.3700000000001
into tiny pieces and then fuse them

1866.33 --> 1870.77
seamlessly back together that seems

1868.37 --> 1872.75
extremely unlikely and convoluted to me

1870.77 --> 1876.47
even to take that try to take that

1872.75 --> 1879.32
effort why would they see so there are

1876.47 --> 1881.48
signs of like okay the technological

1879.32 --> 1885.3799999999999
limitations because there are still some

1881.48 --> 1887.42
limitations with the presumed tartarean

1885.38 --> 1890.7800000000002
techniques of stone levitation and

1887.42 --> 1893.24
molding compared to the advantages of

1890.78 --> 1896.6
having actual giants being able to pick

1893.24 --> 1900.77
up huge things with almost no trouble

1896.6 --> 1904.51
and so taking away a lot of extra

1900.77 --> 1907.07
preparation needs for the whole endeavor

1904.51 --> 1909.11
like the only real preparation in the

1907.07 --> 1912.34
Atlantean Age I could imagine would be

1909.11 --> 1915.77
required is just bring a lot of food

1912.34 --> 1917.6
bring a lot of food until the thing is

1915.77 --> 1919.58
built and can be activated and then

1917.6 --> 1920.99
finally the giant stone no longer need

1919.58 --> 1924.6699999999998
it and then they're gonna take it very

1920.99 --> 1924.67
giant dump somewhere basically

1927.31 --> 1937.61
because of all that food that they ate

1929.48 --> 1940.21
and no longer need yeah I really thought

1937.61 --> 1940.2099999999998
this out

1945.619 --> 1952.549
how long ago did the toydarians exist

1948.989 --> 1960.659
well the Tarte Aryans is basically a

1952.549 --> 1964.739
Renaissance time peaking group they were

1960.659 --> 1969.21
peaking and then they kind of maxed in

1964.739 --> 1973.529
the late 19th century and then they

1969.21 --> 1979.22
basically just got revolutions out of

1973.529 --> 1979.22
existence from the inside and everywhere

1979.399 --> 1984.049
that's what I think roughly what

1981.69 --> 1984.049
happened

1988.16 --> 1998.6000000000001
I don't know how long it was basic I

1994.43 --> 2000.4
think it is since since during the time

1998.6 --> 2004.9599999999998
of the Roman era I think during that

2000.4 --> 2006.97
time because from what I've seen what

2004.96 --> 2009.04
what Martin has shared with us and

2006.97 --> 2010.81
everything the actual tight Aryan roots

2009.04 --> 2015.27
they were at least Christian and Muslim

2010.81 --> 2018.61
so that means or there were Muslim signs

2015.27 --> 2020.56
connected to it but definitely Christian

2018.61 --> 2028.4499999999998
so that means they can be that freaking

2020.56 --> 2031.6599999999999
old so I don't know

2028.45 --> 2036.48
I think they've probably been around for

2031.66 --> 2036.48
what is it like five hundred years maybe

2038.82 --> 2044.8
and how did they come into being they

2042.13 --> 2049.06
probably came into being kind of like in

2044.8 --> 2053.77
Arthurian concept that's probably how

2049.06 --> 2057.04
they started out it would fit the rough

2053.77 --> 2060.58
time period kind of light as well if you

2057.04 --> 2063.639
look at it in a non-traditional way in

2060.58 --> 2065.649
the yeah historically then kind of makes

2063.639 --> 2070.36
sense with the era that it would

2065.649 --> 2073.5
correlate typically with with an

2070.36 --> 2073.5
Arthurian setting

2079.98 --> 2086.069
I've heard people even claim about hurt

2083.639 --> 2089.04
area that's kind of like a related to

2086.069 --> 2091.47
the Irish in some way so that who knows

2089.04 --> 2095.7599999999998
maybe Italy I think he might have

2091.47 --> 2098.4599999999996
claimed literally that Arthur basically

2095.76 --> 2100.46
founded it and that though then you

2098.46 --> 2103.4700000000003
could conceptualize that later on

2100.46 --> 2106.95
Britain basically over conquered it and

2103.47 --> 2110.27
then claimed the legend as its own to

2106.95 --> 2114.8689999999997
erase the original overarching tart area

2110.27 --> 2119.43
that would kind of make sense to rewrite

2114.869 --> 2123.38
that story politically but are adapted

2119.43 --> 2123.3799999999997
to British law as it were

2128.18 --> 2138.0789999999997
no yet truth Blish ass I did it again

2132.619 --> 2140.1800000000003
Trish bliss and I kind of live alone in

2138.079 --> 2143.6600000000003
this room my god I don't live with the

2140.18 --> 2147.02
shared room but I live in a house and I

2143.66 --> 2149.42
have other room mates there as it were

2147.02 --> 2152.109
so I technically don't live alone in

2149.42 --> 2152.109
this house nope

2169.3 --> 2178.42
all right what look

2172.24 --> 2180.5789999999997
tarte aria is just a name basically you

2178.42 --> 2184.89
can call it art area you call it

2180.579 --> 2184.8900000000003
you could potentially call it the Aryan

2185.339 --> 2194.3089999999997
Nation or Empire age I don't know it's

2189.63 --> 2194.309
kind of all in the same direction

2209.42 --> 2214.849
but look even like half it's so

2212.509 --> 2216.65
ridiculous now because when you say

2214.849 --> 2220.819
something like Aryan Nation then you

2216.65 --> 2224.779
think oh the modern [ __ ] that's absolute

2220.819 --> 2227.119
farce nothing about that has anything to

2224.779 --> 2232.849
do with anything historically it's such

2227.119 --> 2235.069
a cartoon ridicule parody of what it's

2232.849 --> 2237.38
supposed to be all that because the

2235.069 --> 2240.89
original original tart Aryans or the

2237.38 --> 2243.98
Knights they were like paladin's I think

2240.89 --> 2246.8289999999997
and they didn't give a [ __ ] about all

2243.98 --> 2250.819
that nonsense and identity politics they

2246.829 --> 2256.6090000000004
were frequency masters they were they

2250.819 --> 2258.71
knew and they let God judge and they

2256.609 --> 2262.3089999999997
were perfectionist probably added that's

2258.71 --> 2265.46
like what that was and on this Aryan

2262.309 --> 2267.65
Nation Aryan identity and it's no it's

2265.46 --> 2270.289
about upholding that spirit and the

2267.65 --> 2273.079
ability to that spirit and that is kind

2270.289 --> 2275.9
of attributed to ancient times where

2273.079 --> 2279.8590000000004
that was upheld by people that just

2275.9 --> 2282.259
happened to be white skin I think a lot

2279.859 --> 2285.17
of them although territory is presumed

2282.259 --> 2288.13
to also have branches basically into

2285.17 --> 2291.589
Mongolian territory and Turkish I think

2288.13 --> 2294.799
it's very wide and of course into Alaska

2291.589 --> 2298.0389999999998
North America and everything so but it's

2294.799 --> 2302.48
kind of that's where that's probably was

2298.039 --> 2306.65
taken from but Aryan Nation all that

2302.48 --> 2309.71
it's such [ __ ] now it's all become

2306.65 --> 2313.849
just about the the paint and no longer

2309.71 --> 2316.43
about actually the original spirit the

2313.849 --> 2318.9500000000003
focus is detracted from that because it

2316.43 --> 2322.6299999999997
is the real thing is a disciplined it's

2318.95 --> 2327.75
a task it's something that's not

2322.63 --> 2331.17
alluring it's necessary

2327.75 --> 2334.109
and that's why it's done and it's not

2331.17 --> 2338.13
meant to be taken on by the majority of

2334.109 --> 2341.04
people so it's not a popular thing it's

2338.13 --> 2343.02
it's never going to be some kind of

2341.04 --> 2345.57
person that has a leadership in a wide

2343.02 --> 2349.14
amount of people because it will never

2345.57 --> 2351.3
the real thing will never speak to the

2349.14 --> 2354.66
majority of people because the majority

2351.3 --> 2356.4900000000002
of people are weak and corruptible they

2354.66 --> 2360.359
don't want that [ __ ] they don't want to

2356.49 --> 2363.9799999999996
be that serious and that is what it's

2360.359 --> 2367.859
all about really so all this area

2363.98 --> 2373.7400000000002
mission [ __ ] and all in it you know and

2367.859 --> 2376.59
every other the was it from all the

2373.74 --> 2379.3489999999997
other suppose at racial groups all that

2376.59 --> 2387.92
the Black Panthers are of it it's all a

2379.349 --> 2392.19
farce it's not it has nothing to do with

2387.92 --> 2394.71
what they're not they're idolizing an

2392.19 --> 2400.02
ideology that makes no sense that is

2394.71 --> 2402.63
basically insane they're not doing it to

2400.02 --> 2405.66
create people that are going to be like

2402.63 --> 2408.17
the original ones they that won't come

2405.66 --> 2408.17
out of that

2418.08 --> 2423.84
I think that it's it's much more

2420.57 --> 2426.8900000000003
important to help people especially in

2423.84 --> 2430.71
their teens to give that to show them

2426.89 --> 2433.74
that that is [ __ ] but that there is

2430.71 --> 2438.63
an original thing to it that applies to

2433.74 --> 2440.91
people and then offer them that and if

2438.63 --> 2443.28
they're ready then that frequency will

2440.91 --> 2446.64
hit them so hard they will never forget

2443.28 --> 2451.17
it it will become part of them they will

2446.64 --> 2454.0099999999998
take the calling if you're lucky if you

2451.17 --> 2454.01
have the right timing

2459.67 --> 2468.31
free Black Panthers fetch other okay

2463.28 --> 2471.3500000000004
Black Panthers it's that's true I guess

2468.31 --> 2482.69
maybe that's I should have taken another

2471.35 --> 2485.38
it's just what is it the the black

2482.69 --> 2490.81
Israelites is probably a better example

2485.38 --> 2494.03
those are some weird cultists figures I

2490.81 --> 2496.82
think Black Panthers is probably yeah

2494.03 --> 2500.3300000000004
not the best of examples but they've had

2496.82 --> 2503.69
their touch of association with like

2500.33 --> 2507.65
Marxist groups as well so that shouldn't

2503.69 --> 2511.79
be underestimated you know a Marxist

2507.65 --> 2514.7000000000003
have also done that kind of stuff but

2511.79 --> 2517.13
they do it for different reasons they do

2514.7 --> 2520.4199999999996
it because they want people dependent on

2517.13 --> 2524.21
them so they got their base for their

2520.42 --> 2526.01
for their quest for power I don't know

2524.21 --> 2527.7200000000003
if the Black Panthers are completely

2526.01 --> 2531.3500000000004
like that I think they kind of are

2527.72 --> 2534.23
really or they have become it's so many

2531.35 --> 2536.5099999999998
of those types of groups all underwent

2534.23 --> 2539.71
such a dark transformation it's very

2536.51 --> 2539.71
hard to find one that hasn't

2542.95 --> 2548.75
but I think the black Israelites are

2545.96 --> 2553.85
probably a better example those are very

2548.75 --> 2555.88
obviously just yeah they are what they

2553.85 --> 2555.88
are

2563.91 --> 2569.69
yeah PJ is too getting really annoying

2583.74 --> 2591.5699999999997
huh right look I'm using race

2588.39 --> 2597.54
colloquially in this sense and it's also

2591.57 --> 2601.29
big I apply it where specifically it is

2597.54 --> 2604.32
taken as a belief it is yeah where it is

2601.29 --> 2607.8
accepted as such that is what I'm trying

2604.32 --> 2611.07
to point that I don't well I I kind of

2607.8 --> 2613.8300000000004
understand it's just a box but it

2611.07 --> 2617.57
doesn't really in the end mean anything

2613.83 --> 2621.119
it can be an indicator to a certain

2617.57 --> 2626.3900000000003
typical set of types that you can find

2621.119 --> 2629.94
in a race as you would designate it but

2626.39 --> 2632.73
in a in a wider sense or a philosophical

2629.94 --> 2635.7000000000003
sense it doesn't really mean anything at

2632.73 --> 2641.06
that I agree but I kind of still use the

2635.7 --> 2643.41
word when I don't use it in everyday

2641.06 --> 2645.42
descriptions or I try to prevent that

2643.41 --> 2647.52
but it sometimes it's still relevant

2645.42 --> 2650.7000000000003
especially when there's groups involved

2647.52 --> 2656.75
that actually believe it then it's

2650.7 --> 2656.75
important to point that out I think

2669.849 --> 2685.719
it yeah yeah yeah Jason right so uh

2677.14 --> 2688.049
let's see see if I can mind-warped why

2685.719 --> 2695.619
is he never here when my show is there

2688.049 --> 2698.309
thought he was Australian he should

2695.619 --> 2698.309
still be up

2712.349 --> 2721.469
I really moved through my subjects

2714.179 --> 2725.5190000000002
pretty quickly didn't I it's just I

2721.469 --> 2728.669
really do I am noticing that I really

2725.519 --> 2732.39
tend to compress information alone and I

2728.669 --> 2734.519
guess I got that habit from from active

2732.39 --> 2737.209
being active in chat because you have to

2734.519 --> 2741.8689999999997
do that there you have to fit it in 200

2737.209 --> 2744.9289999999996
characters so I'm just used to compact

2741.869 --> 2748.2290000000003
formatting things to try to really

2744.929 --> 2749.909
penetrate quickly and I do this for

2748.229 --> 2752.999
every as well but yeah the problem with

2749.909 --> 2756.569
that is is that you you move through the

2752.999 --> 2758.8799999999997
subjects a lot quicker but that's why it

2756.569 --> 2762.209
helps so much when I get actual guests

2758.88 --> 2764.7290000000003
on because then have them to reflect

2762.209 --> 2768.269
upon it and they will force me to

2764.729 --> 2771.029
basically slow down my pace a little and

2768.269 --> 2774.39
that's good because then I don't have

2771.029 --> 2778.679
all this time to fill up

2774.39 --> 2778.679
[Music]

2781.93 --> 2792.0099999999998
right spiritually mentally not

2785.86 --> 2796.51
physically in music man get through to

2792.01 --> 2799.09
people if you try to take those words

2796.51 --> 2802.1200000000003
then yeah that's penetrating getting

2799.09 --> 2805.9300000000003
through getting through penetrating

2802.12 --> 2818.17
spend the same thing right I was

2805.93 --> 2824.23
technically correct yeah yeah yeah don't

2818.17 --> 2828.9700000000003
watch porn as Owen Benjamin says this

2824.23 --> 2831.58
modify your mind now not that I'm

2828.97 --> 2837.33
perfect though and I will admit that I

2831.58 --> 2837.33
still do watch it sometimes but I just

2838.05 --> 2846.19
it's kind of really like I've seen it I

2843.46 --> 2849.46
know what I like what I don't like how

2846.19 --> 2852.42
far I want to go all that [ __ ] and it's

2849.46 --> 2852.42
really I

2855.599 --> 2860.17
yeah it's like with a typical bad

2859.089 --> 2862.41
relationship

2860.17 --> 2866.4700000000003
you could unify it pretty much with that

2862.41 --> 2868.5989999999997
eventually the glory wears off and then

2866.47 --> 2872.3799999999997
you just see all the twitches and all

2868.599 --> 2874.869
the hidden nasty thingies

2872.38 --> 2877.06
the demons basically start to show

2874.869 --> 2879.339
themselves to you and that's what I get

2877.06 --> 2881.17
now too so I totally get where one

2879.339 --> 2882.67
Benjamin says that like just don't watch

2881.17 --> 2886.329
porn it's not good for you it'll

2882.67 --> 2891.4300000000003
desensitize you but that's really only

2886.329 --> 2895.05
when you don't protect yourself from the

2891.43 --> 2898.6299999999997
darkness with like a spiritual condom

2895.05 --> 2901.26
you gotta know that if you're literally

2898.63 --> 2903.9100000000003
like almost like falling in love

2901.26 --> 2906.7000000000003
contacting that in the process you are

2903.91 --> 2910.27
gonna unleash demonic influence that's

2906.7 --> 2912.8799999999997
really true what I've I've learned that

2910.27 --> 2915.7599999999998
[ __ ] even and that by the way also works

2912.88 --> 2919.7200000000003
if you just do with girlfriends that

2915.76 --> 2923.23
have issues it's also a risk you gotta

2919.72 --> 2925.75
protect you you can never put pull your

2923.23 --> 2929.47
guard down for demonic influences

2925.75 --> 2931.599
because they will always use it even

2929.47 --> 2935.2799999999997
through people that are normally in

2931.599 --> 2939.67
control it's just that's what happens

2935.28 --> 2944.4300000000003
huh but yeah basically I do it for you

2939.67 --> 2951.52
Bill and who needs that [ __ ] anyway I I

2944.43 --> 2954.8999999999996
much prefer to have a long romantic face

2951.52 --> 2958.5099999999998
with a girl that I just that I really

2954.9 --> 2963.52
energetically resonate with that's what

2958.51 --> 2966.96
I like the the foreplay I'm an

2963.52 --> 2966.96
old-fashioned kind of man

2971.109 --> 2978.439
raise that old-fashioned I don't know I

2974.41 --> 2983.5389999999998
don't care I like the energy is much

2978.439 --> 2987.16
more than you know then just but pumping

2983.539 --> 2987.1600000000003
or whatever pumping

3008.97 --> 3027.089
yeah that's to TMI musicman TMI right

3022.369 --> 3032.569
but yeah well it doesn't necessarily

3027.089 --> 3042.93
work like that with me but sometimes I

3032.569 --> 3045.569
don't know I just really I don't know

3042.93 --> 3048.06
what that is maybe it's just like you

3045.569 --> 3050.16
just get more sensitive to it and then

3048.06 --> 3052.14
certainly girls all start to look more

3050.16 --> 3055.95
attractive that kind of stuff and yeah

3052.14 --> 3057.99
you know what are you gonna just try to

3055.95 --> 3061.6189999999997
hang in there sit through that and go

3057.99 --> 3064.5
nuts just get it over with and move on

3061.619 --> 3067.8
with it and then act like a normal human

3064.5 --> 3071.13
being also enabling you to actually just

3067.8 --> 3073.7000000000003
engage and get to learn women instead of

3071.13 --> 3078.869
just like being all obsessed over them

3073.7 --> 3081.81
so ah thank you flat out faith for the

3078.869 --> 3084.859
$20 super chat donation thank you a lot

3081.81 --> 3090.47
grow the show don't watch porn research

3084.859 --> 3090.47
Effy many blessings indeed

3094.98 --> 3102.329
although now I'm gonna basically ruin it

3097.95 --> 3105.66
again by saying like I'm not like saying

3102.329 --> 3109.7400000000002
never don't ever think about sex don't

3105.66 --> 3113.73
ever ever watch porn it's just like with

3109.74 --> 3116.339
so many other things be careful because

3113.73 --> 3119.01
it's something you can get addicted to

3116.339 --> 3123.9
and when you do it'll absolutely screw

3119.01 --> 3125.9100000000003
you up so and everybody's exposed to

3123.9 --> 3128.52
that [ __ ] now you got to be careful and

3125.91 --> 3131.04
you got to learn how to retract because

3128.52 --> 3135.72
when you start to engage it will be

3131.04 --> 3141.93
absolutely rammed through you and they

3135.72 --> 3145.4399999999996
will try to make you an addict brainwash

3141.93 --> 3147.54
you deeper so you got to be very careful

3145.44 --> 3154.859
with that [ __ ] it's it's probably better

3147.54 --> 3157.32
to just leave it out don't engage but if

3154.859 --> 3159.859
you're like I don't know a teenager that

3157.32 --> 3162.839
could be very difficult I could imagine

3159.859 --> 3166.5
or you're just gonna be like screw it

3162.839 --> 3170.5789999999997
I'm just gonna take whatever girl or guy

3166.5 --> 3172.98
I don't know I think that probably

3170.579 --> 3179.069
teenagers these days are so easy with

3172.98 --> 3183.51
sex it will probably repulse me you know

3179.069 --> 3185.64
sometimes when I hear people that are

3183.51 --> 3188.4300000000003
like younger than me just out in the

3185.64 --> 3193.319
open talk about like sexual details it

3188.43 --> 3195.06
just makes me Jesus [ __ ] really you're

3193.319 --> 3198.89
gonna just say that in the open are you

3195.06 --> 3201.839
freakin insane that's just disgusting

3198.89 --> 3206.67
like I'd be totally embarrassed to utter

3201.839 --> 3209.79
that in public you know some of these

3206.67 --> 3213.619
people just completely desensitize it's

3209.79 --> 3213.619
been normalized to a lot of people

3224.67 --> 3227.27
yeah

3237.66 --> 3245.67
okay music man juicing raw vegetables

3242.99 --> 3250.9199999999996
well it all depends on what vegetables

3245.67 --> 3253.349
you're reducing of course and were they

3250.92 --> 3255.329
all organic all that stuff it all

3253.349 --> 3261.029
matters and also you got you add it's

3255.329 --> 3263.4300000000003
just you've got to also realize there

3261.029 --> 3265.47
will be detox effects and that might

3263.43 --> 3267.93
have some kind of weird side effect so

3265.47 --> 3271.3799999999997
maybe yeah sleep paralysis could be

3267.93 --> 3281.759
response to that I don't know what it is

3271.38 --> 3284.849
can't really tell sprouts i raw

3281.759 --> 3288.23
did you eat sprouts raw I don't think

3284.849 --> 3295.369
that you're supposed to do that and

3288.23 --> 3295.369
broccoli neither I think

3304.96 --> 3313.75
like not everything raw is good okay

3311.04 --> 3315.82
it's like okay some things you could

3313.75 --> 3320.52
probably eat raw but that doesn't mean

3315.82 --> 3321.75
that it's good broccoli salad is eaten

3320.52 --> 3324.96
really

3321.75 --> 3328.26
okay I'm gonna look this up I've never

3324.96 --> 3328.26
broccoli raw

3329.68 --> 3332.96
[Music]

3338.38 --> 3350.08
okay did okay let's get into something

3344.02 --> 3352.65
just a general thing duty well blah blah

3350.08 --> 3352.65
blah blah

3373.07 --> 3387.3700000000003
okay well apparently you can eat it raw

3377.93 --> 3391.43
- I had no idea that seems weird to me

3387.37 --> 3394.79
and apparently cooking it locks in the

3391.43 --> 3406.22
soul for a fame I don't even know what

3394.79 --> 3409.64
that is really let's look that up oh wow

3406.22 --> 3411.16
you got separate and supplements of that

3409.64 --> 3415.0699999999997
stuff huh

3411.16 --> 3419.02
okay well maybe I need some of that

3415.07 --> 3422.05
because I don't really like broccoli raw

3419.02 --> 3422.05
[Music]

3425.11 --> 3428.11
okay

3429.25 --> 3433.17
brussel sprouts cabbage

3452.07 --> 3459.9900000000002
right this is interesting what they say

3458.07 --> 3462.81
here although there has been some basic

3459.99 --> 3467.58
research on how so for a lane might

3462.81 --> 3471.77
exert beneficial effects in vivo there

3467.58 --> 3471.77
is no high quality evidence today that

3472.07 --> 3478.31
efficacy that its efficacy against

3475.38 --> 3481.77
humans to date for its efficacies

3478.31 --> 3487.88
efficacy against human diseases freakin

3481.77 --> 3487.88
let's see this basic research ok

3492.6 --> 3502.13
so and you reference to that that's

3499.68 --> 3502.1299999999997
weird

3505.01 --> 3508.88
okay yeah here it is

3511.93 --> 3522.7
Veta therapy what okay well that doesn't

3520.15 --> 3526.509
seem to be I don't know maybe did they

3522.7 --> 3529.6899999999996
leave that out okay here's another

3526.509 --> 3532.499
references micronutrients information

3529.69 --> 3532.4990000000003
center right

3538.049 --> 3547.749
okay this so well there may be something

3543.46 --> 3550.95
to look I'm a believer in general in

3547.749 --> 3554.109
nutrition that's the thing that I just

3550.95 --> 3558.009
that have always went with but I also

3554.109 --> 3562.3489999999997
recognize that there may be some things

3558.009 --> 3565.539
that are kind of like really believed

3562.349 --> 3568.48
well it's very hard to basically isolate

3565.539 --> 3570.46
an actual effect because it just seems

3568.48 --> 3572.41
to be more and more as you go the

3570.46 --> 3574.69
holistic approach will show you that it

3572.41 --> 3578.259
is a conjunction of all the substances

3574.69 --> 3580.059
together that allow all these effects in

3578.259 --> 3581.73
the restoration of the body and all that

3580.059 --> 3585.1600000000003
to take place

3581.73 --> 3587.38
so all these isolated claims about this

3585.16 --> 3591.339
specific substance that's really a

3587.38 --> 3593.4990000000003
pharmaceutical supplies to isolate a

3591.339 --> 3597.819
substance and then attribute a specific

3593.499 --> 3602.049
effect to it so that this piece here may

3597.819 --> 3604.69
be one of the yeah a preliminary proof

3602.049 --> 3608.499
of these things that they're just things

3604.69 --> 3610.39
assumed to do that while it it's not

3608.499 --> 3612.5789999999997
really scientifically clear if that's

3610.39 --> 3615.1299999999997
really the case it's just tends to come

3612.579 --> 3621.069
up as a belief within the conjunction of

3615.13 --> 3624.19
certain researches I think then again

3621.069 --> 3627.21
tends to get further refined and refined

3624.19 --> 3628.329
because there's a lot of research in

3627.21 --> 3632.67
nutraceuticals

3628.329 --> 3632.67
these days a lot of it and it's good

3636.55 --> 3649.69
hmm all right so yeah okay what did what

3647.24 --> 3649.6899999999996
is this

3655.33 --> 3663.7799999999997
mmm Nathan is life no it's a premiere

3666.92 --> 3676.91
weird it says streamed life why did it

3673.67 --> 3678.44
why this this pop-up like it just went

3676.91 --> 3683.21
live this is ridiculous

3678.44 --> 3684.619
this was yesterday okay that YouTube is

3683.21 --> 3687.4700000000003
just messing up

3684.619 --> 3689.809
that's ridiculous like in the corner you

3687.47 --> 3692.24
know the little pop-up like yeah this is

3689.809 --> 3696.2000000000003
happening in YouTube it just went up

3692.24 --> 3698.8999999999996
nathan is just going live then I click

3696.2 --> 3702.3089999999997
on it's like yes dream life the day

3698.9 --> 3702.309
before what

3710.52 --> 3713.52
yeah

3716.55 --> 3719.679
[Music]

3721.29 --> 3739.47
Oh PJ I'm glad you're entertaining some

3728.66 --> 3744.81
somebody out there at least Trish I just

3739.47 --> 3748.8599999999997
told you like a half an hour ago yes I

3744.81 --> 3751.0499999999997
am single I live in this this little box

3748.86 --> 3753.48
here and I share this house with other

3751.05 --> 3758.76
roommates the kitchen basically in the

3753.48 --> 3761.39
bathroom and all that so technically I

3758.76 --> 3768.38
don't live alone in this house

3761.39 --> 3768.3799999999997
but yes now please stop asking

3788.369 --> 3796.67
yes yes yes yes sorry sorry I can get a

3792.15 --> 3796.67
little snappy sometimes it's just like

3798.499 --> 3804.6899999999996
I'm kind of like secretly irrationally

3801.989 --> 3807.119
demanding everybody is hanging on my

3804.69 --> 3809.94
every word and that they're not

3807.119 --> 3812.099
wandering off in attention but I know

3809.94 --> 3815.5190000000002
that's kind of an unreasonable thing to

3812.099 --> 3818.3900000000003
ask from a live audience but I kind of

3815.519 --> 3821.279
secretly do that anyway sorry about that

3818.39 --> 3824.64
so I can get a bit snappy sometimes when

3821.279 --> 3829.92
somebody didn't pay attention nothing

3824.64 --> 3832.259
personal and that's you're a baller and

3829.92 --> 3836.4
you're and it's like happened four five

3832.259 --> 3848.63
times in you know in a week then I do

3836.4 --> 3852.359
really get pissed off Wow

3848.63 --> 3855.21
PJ that's interesting you should film

3852.359 --> 3859.339
that next time I'm serious that will be

3855.21 --> 3862.2
really interesting just take your mobile

3859.339 --> 3865.259
you set it on record put it like in the

3862.2 --> 3870.6299999999997
corner and then start singing and get

3865.259 --> 3874.499
those cows I want to see that wouldn't

3870.63 --> 3876.779
you guys I think if you had a video like

3874.499 --> 3878.5789999999997
that that would actually make me want to

3876.779 --> 3885.019
go to your channel and check out that

3878.579 --> 3885.0190000000002
video for a change

3901.72 --> 3908.83
yeah don't tarry you're probably right

3906.21 --> 3911.2
guys probably do listen more than

3908.83 --> 3913.87
average people because they don't have

3911.2 --> 3916.27
so much activity there to distract them

3913.87 --> 3918.04
from what's going on to them so they'll

3916.27 --> 3919.33
just be like oh there's something

3918.04 --> 3921.7
happening here it's not like they're

3919.33 --> 3929.59
gonna get it but at least they'll be

3921.7 --> 3931.5099999999998
paying attention so Pete yeah

3929.59 --> 3932.9100000000003
yeah if you recommend it for everyone

3931.51 --> 3936.51
you're gonna have to set an example

3932.91 --> 3941.5
you're gonna have to actually film it

3936.51 --> 3943.78
with sound you singing that the 911 is

3941.5 --> 3948.19
an inside job song or whatever that was

3943.78 --> 3949.36
and seeing how cows flock together I

3948.19 --> 3954.28
want to see a video of that

3949.36 --> 3957.52
I know I know pje look it's been I guess

3954.28 --> 3960.82
scientifically proven that it's

3957.52 --> 3963.13
specifically with cows that they tested

3960.82 --> 3965.86
out several types of music that they

3963.13 --> 3969.67
would be playing in the stables or where

3965.86 --> 3974.98
the cows are during milk time and they

3969.67 --> 3978.79
figured out that if you put on let's say

3974.98 --> 3981.85
Slayer the cows will get the milk will

3978.79 --> 3983.71
get sour a lot quicker and the cows get

3981.85 --> 3987.61
really stressed out and stop giving milk

3983.71 --> 3990.2200000000003
eventually but if you play just an

3987.61 --> 3993.73
average lift music they're kind of fine

3990.22 --> 3996.6099999999997
with it and even there's other types of

3993.73 --> 4000.18
music like I think it was Mozart that

3996.61 --> 4003.1400000000003
certain symphonies of Mozart have been

4000.18 --> 4007.0499999999997
tested and that would actually yield

4003.14 --> 4009.5299999999997
positive results that it will make more

4007.05 --> 4013.32
milk and it would work better so now I

4009.53 --> 4015.36
remember that study I wonder in

4013.32 --> 4021.54
retrospect if that was really really

4015.36 --> 4024.6600000000003
tested but it well comparing it to dr.

4021.54 --> 4027.68
Emoto study on the influence on water

4024.66 --> 4031.44
crystals that makes sense so intention

4027.68 --> 4033.54
mental reflection States spirit energy

4031.44 --> 4034.789
in the atmosphere yeah it will reflect

4033.54 --> 4036.979
upon the

4034.789 --> 4040.5190000000002
quits upon water related liquids

4036.979 --> 4043.0989999999997
including milk so who knows if you play

4040.519 --> 4047.5589999999997
Mozart in the stables during milk time

4043.099 --> 4051.38
the cows will will yield better milk I

4047.559 --> 4056.989
think that that's actually empirically

4051.38 --> 4059.3900000000003
proven so yes BJ cows do definitely

4056.989 --> 4063.679
respond to music and if you're a kind of

4059.39 --> 4066.319
a pleasant singer no yeah positive in

4063.679 --> 4069.349
some way then the cows might enjoy that

4066.319 --> 4071.839
indeed so go and film it I want to see

4069.349 --> 4074.289
you seeing that two cows on video that

4071.839 --> 4074.2889999999998
will be cool

4081.98 --> 4084.98
mmm

4090.89 --> 4097.4
the world is full of miracles isn't it

4094.03 --> 4101.3
and sometimes you need a silly person to

4097.4 --> 4106.5199999999995
remind you of just all these gems in the

4101.3 --> 4109.43
past that relate to it and I'm so glad

4106.52 --> 4112.4800000000005
that after everything that's overcome me

4109.43 --> 4115.070000000001
and that I basically did to myself

4112.48 --> 4119.179999999999
chemically with food and [ __ ]

4115.07 --> 4120.799999999999
and yeah I have gotten vaccines and it

4119.18 --> 4124.91
probably did influence me and all that

4120.8 --> 4127.22
and I'm so glad that what I thought I

4124.91 --> 4130.13
used to think like oh my god

4127.22 --> 4134.14
my memory is dependent on my brain

4130.13 --> 4137.900000000001
matter and my brain matter risks off

4134.14 --> 4141.59
disintegrating over time so and it

4137.9 --> 4143.599999999999
doesn't grow back they say you know so I

4141.59 --> 4145.91
was literally like oh my god I can see

4143.6 --> 4148.490000000001
all this thing getting ideas oh I'm so

4145.91 --> 4151.7
afraid that it's gonna go away and I'm

4148.49 --> 4155.75
gonna be in a [ __ ] old man that's

4151.7 --> 4158.66
literally what I thought in my teens and

4155.75 --> 4163.64
they might give in to my 20s even that

4158.66 --> 4167.0599999999995
was and then I figured out no that is

4163.64 --> 4169.490000000001
wrong it's a lie because there's just

4167.06 --> 4173.54
these cycles and then when you get out

4169.49 --> 4176.78
of it everything can be back

4173.54 --> 4180.98
you don't really really really forget

4176.78 --> 4182.9
anything you can lose contact with

4180.98 --> 4186.44
something that happened you can just

4182.9 --> 4190.16
somehow not reach it or it will evade

4186.44 --> 4193.04
you've just never it'll never hit your

4190.16 --> 4195.17
mind but it's never gone I really

4193.04 --> 4197.78
figured out that everything you

4195.17 --> 4199.61
experience consciously and especially

4197.78 --> 4205.3099999999995
the consciously you can never really

4199.61 --> 4206.9
forget even if you didn't see the

4205.31 --> 4210.1
significance of it that can

4206.9 --> 4213.74
retroactively lis catch on and basically

4210.1 --> 4218.120000000001
infuse the old memory give it a new

4213.74 --> 4221.75
layer of meaning inside of that and so

4218.12 --> 4223.63
you never really forget things in my in

4221.75 --> 4226.27
my experience and

4223.63 --> 4229.81
it's a lesson I had to learn over time

4226.27 --> 4231.820000000001
and the funny thing is that at first the

4229.81 --> 4234.1900000000005
idea that you were gonna slowly lose

4231.82 --> 4238.09
your memories is a terrifying thought

4234.19 --> 4240.4
but if you engage in sick or in risky

4238.09 --> 4243.46
things then it's like oh just forget

4240.4 --> 4248.7699999999995
anywhere you know but then later you

4243.46 --> 4252.58
might figure out like [ __ ] why am i not

4248.77 --> 4253.360000000001
forgetting this you know and yeah and

4252.58 --> 4256.48
there you go

4253.36 --> 4259.449
so it's better to assume that you'll

4256.48 --> 4261.218999999999
never forget anything even though that

4259.449 --> 4262.96
might seem the case or even though you

4261.219 --> 4265.54
might have periods where you have

4262.96 --> 4268.3
trouble somehow reaching your memories

4265.54 --> 4270.159
where it's like fogged up but that

4268.3 --> 4274.150000000001
doesn't mean that you're actually losing

4270.159 --> 4276.759999999999
them I think personally that there's not

4274.15 --> 4282.699
even certainty that actual structural

4276.76 --> 4286.389
memories are a physiological part of the

4282.699 --> 4290.469
human body I think that it is ingrained

4286.389 --> 4293.5
like crypto energy is it were like a

4290.469 --> 4295.78
fractal compacted fractal within the

4293.5 --> 4298.0
very frequency of the entire spirit

4295.78 --> 4300.099999999999
energy I think that is where memory is

4298.0 --> 4306.429
really stored and that simply reflects

4300.1 --> 4309.01
upon the specific zone where the

4306.429 --> 4312.9400000000005
activity interacts with the physical

4309.01 --> 4314.26
part of the brain the registry as I call

4312.94 --> 4317.409
it because I think that the nervous

4314.26 --> 4324.12
system is a registry for the spirit not

4317.409 --> 4324.12
the actual functional part of it

4333.74 --> 4336.84
[Music]

4339.61 --> 4346.67
so yeah just consider that everything

4342.95 --> 4349.48
you do does matter everything matters

4346.67 --> 4349.4800000000005
one way or the other

4353.49 --> 4356.599999999999
[Music]

4360.1 --> 4365.35
and by the way that realization is also

4363.16 --> 4369.5199999999995
the thing that makes me inclined to take

4365.35 --> 4373.530000000001
things so serious all the time because

4369.52 --> 4377.5
it's like I experienced yeah God

4373.53 --> 4380.83
basically showed me it really does

4377.5 --> 4382.51
matter you can fool yourself into

4380.83 --> 4386.92
believing like it doesn't really matter

4382.51 --> 4389.68
and just screwing around is okay but in

4386.92 --> 4392.29
reality it's not everything you do has

4389.68 --> 4397.18
consequences whether you believe it or

4392.29 --> 4399.49
not and that concept those consequences

4397.18 --> 4404.13
will reflect upon the world and will

4399.49 --> 4404.13
eventually always reflect back upon you

4408.45 --> 4416.67
like karma maybe that is what karma

4414.22 --> 4416.67
really is

4421.269 --> 4427.030000000001
anyway I think karma is more like a

4423.07 --> 4429.999
description of a certain process that is

4427.03 --> 4434.199
relevant rather than an actual physical

4429.999 --> 4438.4
or scientific thing is it's just a a

4434.199 --> 4442.329
process that is a very important part to

4438.4 --> 4448.21
realize when you deep in your

4442.329 --> 4452.289
consciousness it's almost like your

4448.21 --> 4455.44
contract with God like everything you do

4452.289 --> 4458.349
really matters somehow doesn't mean you

4455.44 --> 4460.539
always have you like you persistently

4458.349 --> 4462.67
have to have that peak consciousness

4460.539 --> 4468.699
constantly because that'll drive you

4462.67 --> 4472.57
nuts but if you basically fool yourself

4468.699 --> 4475.48
in like oh nobody is looking I can do it

4472.57 --> 4479.499
I can get away with it

4475.48 --> 4482.888999999999
then then you're wrong always no matter

4479.499 --> 4488.519
how well you can fool it even if you are

4482.889 --> 4488.519
there keeping that secret it'll somehow

4488.909 --> 4497.4
be like a little little piece of sand in

4493.78 --> 4500.92
your eye it'll it it never goes away

4497.4 --> 4504.789
really that's about it that real evil is

4500.92 --> 4507.55
like how many scars can you bear there

4504.789 --> 4511.48
can you yep like how many wounds can you

4507.55 --> 4513.519
basically hold to yourself keep

4511.48 --> 4516.159
concealed for the outside world that's

4513.519 --> 4518.17
the real thing that's really what real

4516.159 --> 4520.589999999999
evil is about how many wounds can you

4518.17 --> 4523.63
keep concealed from the outside world

4520.59 --> 4527.76
that's why real evil always ends up

4523.63 --> 4532.4800000000005
being - a total Bluff but what they are

4527.76 --> 4538.659000000001
what they intend to do what they feel

4532.48 --> 4541.509999999999
about things if they even really still

4538.659 --> 4545.699
remember what that is if it's not just

4541.51 --> 4548.679
an act from a certain perspective

4545.699 --> 4550.928999999999
do they even really know what they still

4548.679 --> 4553.179
feel when everything becomes an act in

4550.929 --> 4553.96
the block and a bluff and just an

4553.179 --> 4555.61
attempted

4553.96 --> 4558.46
fence against the outside world to

4555.61 --> 4574.299999999999
conceal all these wounds that they have

4558.46 --> 4578.46
inflicted upon themselves I hope you

4574.3 --> 4578.46
guys get it what I'm trying to say

4587.62 --> 4595.03
yeah and I've also been conceptualizing

4589.93 --> 4598.3
that that could be it that they

4595.03 --> 4602.62
literally even do the sin stuff to

4598.3 --> 4605.14
basically stay in that mode in that off

4602.62 --> 4609.79
in that defensive mode to keep concealed

4605.14 --> 4612.76
that they add upon more moons to prevent

4609.79 --> 4614.95
the unraveling of their image of what

4612.76 --> 4617.29
they're trying to supposedly accomplish

4614.95 --> 4619.599999999999
that that is the I that it's a

4617.29 --> 4623.95
psychological reason to keep them in

4619.6 --> 4627.55
line of their plan instead of succumbing

4623.95 --> 4630.849999999999
to the pressure as it were maybe I think

4627.55 --> 4634.59
that it might be that actual reason why

4630.85 --> 4638.110000000001
they just do all this messed up [ __ ]

4634.59 --> 4642.610000000001
that's just that would just drive any

4638.11 --> 4651.3099999999995
normal person mad to even consider doing

4642.61 --> 4655.36
that yeah evil is disgusting and insane

4651.31 --> 4658.09
literally this is giant stain keep it

4655.36 --> 4661.45
stained don't allowed the pollution to

4658.09 --> 4665.2300000000005
go away don't let the light shine

4661.45 --> 4667.51
through that's it insane like a giant

4665.23 --> 4672.8099999999995
ink stain through the water so no light

4667.51 --> 4675.929
can get through it that's evil

4672.81 --> 4675.929
[Music]

4680.489 --> 4690.209999999999
oh right Jonathan Daughtry I heard about

4683.73 --> 4694.73
it it's weird but I haven't seen much

4690.21 --> 4698.9
follow up on that though I think I I

4694.73 --> 4701.968999999999
kind of think it's a a play it's like

4698.9 --> 4705.179999999999
secret war this great war

4701.969 --> 4707.16
I don't know if that's real you know I

4705.18 --> 4713.070000000001
think that might just be a cover story

4707.16 --> 4715.86
for more rumors as it were about these

4713.07 --> 4719.219
yeah about some kind of excuse building

4715.86 --> 4721.13
up to a giant war to keep the

4719.219 --> 4723.9890000000005
military-industrial complex going I

4721.13 --> 4726.2300000000005
don't know if that is really real as you

4723.989 --> 4726.23
say

4731.34 --> 4734.52
[Music]

4736.09 --> 4743.110000000001
look if ya jonathan todo tree if that is

4739.18 --> 4745.39
real then you know let some guy in about

4743.11 --> 4747.54
go there in a divers suit with some

4745.39 --> 4752.35
cameras and actually see the wreckage

4747.54 --> 4755.53
actually see that is there then i'll

4752.35 --> 4757.39
i'll have an opinion about it other than

4755.53 --> 4760.15
otherwise it's just going to be another

4757.39 --> 4763.56
one of those secret stories probably

4760.15 --> 4763.5599999999995
roll out by the CIA

4764.79 --> 4774.07
alright the base is closed of course but

4772.03 --> 4776.92
you don't know it could be a cover story

4774.07 --> 4779.41
it could be real it could be actually

4776.92 --> 4781.39
something different that nobody's

4779.41 --> 4783.22
supposed to know about and this is just

4781.39 --> 4786.87
the cover story designation that they

4783.22 --> 4786.87
give it you know

4798.35 --> 4805.75
yeah anyway yeah I'm not getting any

4802.97 --> 4805.75
guests today I think

4813.629 --> 4821.179
oh wait was there something else mm-hmm

4817.26 --> 4821.179
oh yeah right almost forgot

4822.859 --> 4829.59
right I figured out a piece of trickery

4825.599 --> 4831.869000000001
I was fooled with this or rather I was

4829.59 --> 4832.649
being fooled kind of felt it but didn't

4831.869 --> 4837.539
see it yet

4832.649 --> 4842.479
and that concerns a video that I was

4837.539 --> 4851.009999999999
shown to me during the during Jose's

4842.479 --> 4854.099
hold on let me get this that when I was

4851.01 --> 4858.119000000001
arguing that light was not a particle

4854.099 --> 4862.26
and that I didn't have a speed and they

4858.119 --> 4864.57
showed me a certain thing it's right

4862.26 --> 4867.659000000001
here

4864.57 --> 4870.749
a bottle which was supposed to be

4867.659 --> 4876.53
proving that light was traveling at a

4870.749 --> 4876.53
speed all right so let me show you this

4877.07 --> 4882.688999999999
all right this see and this is supposed

4880.859 --> 4886.609
to prove the particle nature of light

4882.689 --> 4891.389
and I was fooled because I thought hey

4886.609 --> 4893.820000000001
hold on so there is a light being fired

4891.389 --> 4896.039
from the back of the bottle and you it's

4893.82 --> 4899.249
being filmed so slow you are literally

4896.039 --> 4900.78
seeing it like a wave move through it

4899.249 --> 4904.889
that's what I thought

4900.78 --> 4907.32
so it's like does this something off I

4904.889 --> 4910.53
didn't really go for it but I thought

4907.32 --> 4915.268999999999
that well guess what that's not at all

4910.53 --> 4916.648999999999
what this video is because before and I

4915.269 --> 4920.519
didn't get to see that part they're

4916.649 --> 4925.7390000000005
literally showing you here how they're

4920.519 --> 4928.8
using a mirror to reflect light at a

4925.739 --> 4933.03
certain rotation speed and then filming

4928.8 --> 4935.219
it extremely compacted so it's not

4933.03 --> 4938.989
literally a light beam traveling now

4935.219 --> 4938.9890000000005
it's just rotating its

4939.28 --> 4954.179999999999
it doesn't prove light traveling speed

4942.94 --> 4957.46
at all not even close it's just amazing

4954.18 --> 4959.77
they literally tried to fool me and here

4957.46 --> 4962.11
look it says in the video visualizing

4959.77 --> 4965.71
video at the speed of light well says

4962.11 --> 4969.4
speed of light the speed of light is a

4965.71 --> 4973.02
myth there is no proof for the speed of

4969.4 --> 4976.96
light so it's almost suggested it is

4973.02 --> 4980.77
filmed at the precip at an interval rate

4976.96 --> 4982.47
at the presupposed speed of light get it

4980.77 --> 4986.410000000001
that's actually what they're doing the

4982.47 --> 4988.740000000001
presupposed speed of light that doesn't

4986.41 --> 4991.93
actually prove the speed of lights

4988.74 --> 4996.94
they're just taking an interval rates of

4991.93 --> 5001.200000000001
a light not being fired and then seeing

4996.94 --> 5004.25
the beam come out and then no it's just

5001.2 --> 5010.099999999999
being moved the beam is being rotated

5004.25 --> 5014.61
and that's what's been filmed at a very

5010.1 --> 5019.9800000000005
small rate due to the yeah the light

5014.61 --> 5022.38
speed interval rate so it's not proving

5019.98 --> 5026.2699999999995
a particle at all it's actually quite

5022.38 --> 5029.01
astonishing proof that light is

5026.27 --> 5032.64
instantaneous and it definitely did look

5029.01 --> 5035.070000000001
like it is a beam look at that look at

5032.64 --> 5038.6900000000005
that energy it's that's not a particle

5035.07 --> 5038.69
guys look at that

5041.16 --> 5044.16
yeah

5048.159 --> 5054.82
does that look like a light particle

5050.26 --> 5057.610000000001
traveling his speed no it's a mirror

5054.82 --> 5060.67
rotating being filmed very slowly and

5057.61 --> 5065.29
then an Indian guy with a smug look on

5060.67 --> 5067.54
his face basically saying yeah this is

5065.29 --> 5069.909
so awesome this proves all these

5067.54 --> 5072.55
presuppositions although we're not

5069.909 --> 5075.19
literally claiming that but we're just

5072.55 --> 5076.889
putting it in there because it's really

5075.19 --> 5078.79
interesting because people are

5076.889 --> 5080.9490000000005
fascinated by it and none really

5078.79 --> 5082.239
realized that there's no such thing as

5080.949 --> 5085.0
the speed of light because it's

5082.239 --> 5087.638999999999
instantaneous but we like to kind of

5085.0 --> 5090.58
trick people constantly into believing

5087.639 --> 5092.59
that speed has a light by assuming it

5090.58 --> 5095.98
and then associating that assumption

5092.59 --> 5098.92
with setups that don't actually prove it

5095.98 --> 5109.419999999999
so thank you mister schmuck looking

5098.92 --> 5113.61
Indian man thank you very much oh my god

5109.42 --> 5113.61
Jason McCormick you can't be serious

5116.59 --> 5119.429
yeah

5126.679 --> 5132.53
pulse no ace MacLeod I didn't really see

5130.159 --> 5137.44
a pulse I just saw a singular light beam

5132.53 --> 5140.719
being rotated and then filmed at a very

5137.44 --> 5143.2699999999995
microscopic interval rate that's

5140.719 --> 5149.78
supposedly associates with the speed of

5143.27 --> 5152.96
light as they claim so no particle no

5149.78 --> 5155.42
actual proof of a particle traveling

5152.96 --> 5158.39
there was never any proof of that that

5155.42 --> 5162.05
light was actually traveling Travel

5158.39 --> 5166.3
suggests a transit of location there is

5162.05 --> 5169.3
none of that it manifests it's there

5166.3 --> 5169.3
there

5179.17 --> 5187.64
yeah yeah

5182.03 --> 5190.699
oh god Randa yeah your judgments your

5187.64 --> 5193.88
judgments I don't think your judgment

5190.699 --> 5196.73
resonates with a lot of people these

5193.88 --> 5198.32
days Brenda I don't think anyone takes

5196.73 --> 5201.62
you series anymore and that includes

5198.32 --> 5203.719
yourself at this point because you just

5201.62 --> 5209.449
claimed that everybody doesn't know

5203.719 --> 5212.81
anything well every time you even like

5209.449 --> 5215.12
go to in this somewhat of a conversation

5212.81 --> 5217.6990000000005
with people you prove on the spot that

5215.12 --> 5219.83
you're even incapable of basically

5217.699 --> 5224.8099999999995
looking something up very quickly and

5219.83 --> 5227.66
then you almost seem illiterate I don't

5224.81 --> 5229.31
know why like are you really blind it

5227.66 --> 5230.78
could be that would explain you know if

5229.31 --> 5234.67
I was blind I would have a lot of

5230.78 --> 5237.259999999999
trouble looking things up in Google so

5234.67 --> 5239.36
you know I wouldn't hold it against you

5237.26 --> 5242.9800000000005
it would explain some things but if

5239.36 --> 5248.83
that's not the case then you are just

5242.98 --> 5248.83
morbidly lazy concerning information

5249.13 --> 5257.26
Brenda morbidly lazy it's just it's

5254.87 --> 5257.26
atrocious

5260.98 --> 5264.12
[Music]

5265.299 --> 5270.189
all right sir Kiko have you talked about

5268.209 --> 5272.409
the speed of sound yet yeah the speed of

5270.189 --> 5277.539000000001
sound is interesting because what is

5272.409 --> 5283.598999999999
sound you know it what is sound sound is

5277.539 --> 5285.999
a wave kind of well it is a wave it was

5283.599 --> 5288.249
a wave that prepare that is manifest

5285.999 --> 5293.639
through certain processes amplitude in

5288.249 --> 5300.299
no ways longitudinal waves that sound is

5293.639 --> 5300.299
basically the compression and

5300.929 --> 5309.339
propagation of that yeah compression

5306.219 --> 5311.469
decompression effect of air usually

5309.339 --> 5316.059
another matter as well but mostly air

5311.469 --> 5320.439
and that propels itself it's a resonance

5316.059 --> 5323.079000000001
pattern but it really is a medium the

5320.439 --> 5325.179
medium is being subjected to this effect

5323.079 --> 5329.289
that is what sound really is it's the

5325.179 --> 5331.479
medium that is being it's a medium

5329.289 --> 5335.249
effect without a medium there is no

5331.479 --> 5337.919
sound so that's very different from

5335.249 --> 5340.929
compared to for example light or

5337.919 --> 5342.849
electrical energy that is definitely

5340.929 --> 5346.559
something that is separate that can

5342.849 --> 5346.559
exist separate from matter

5350.199 --> 5358.03
and thus since sound is comprised purely

5354.159 --> 5363.03
of matter itself then it is subjected to

5358.03 --> 5366.509999999999
the laws of matter including that it has

5363.03 --> 5368.739
location and speed and all that that is

5366.51 --> 5374.499
kind of that comes with the matter

5368.739 --> 5377.499
package that's logical that's part of

5374.499 --> 5380.199
matter so if sound is basically it's an

5377.499 --> 5383.38
effect within matter then definitely it

5380.199 --> 5385.119
has a speed we can measure it there is

5383.38 --> 5386.559
literally sound delay and everything you

5385.119 --> 5388.539
can even notice this with lightning so

5386.559 --> 5390.729
you can prove that sound has a delay

5388.539 --> 5394.599
that it has a speed with natural

5390.729 --> 5399.309
phenomena of lightning strike basically

5394.599 --> 5403.959
and the proximity to it so that's very

5399.309 --> 5406.719
easily proven but it is basically a

5403.959 --> 5411.579
medium transfer it's not a separate

5406.719 --> 5415.599
thing it's an effect anyway I'm gonna

5411.579 --> 5417.67
round out the shower guys so if you

5415.599 --> 5420.1900000000005
liked it please don't forget to upload

5417.67 --> 5421.57
it and if you haven't subscribed already

5420.19 --> 5423.039
please do so and hit the bell

5421.57 --> 5424.36
notification so you know when I'm going

5423.039 --> 5426.3
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

5424.36 --> 5429.009999999999
amsterdam time every day

5426.3 --> 5431.9490000000005
please also support my channel through

5429.01 --> 5436.63
the super chats paypal patreon and my

5431.949 --> 5438.249
GoFundMe thank a leer oh it's out of the

5436.63 --> 5440.999
way but yeah I got the big super chat

5438.249 --> 5445.329
earlier thank you again for that so much

5440.999 --> 5451.239
it's good I will be back tomorrow with

5445.329 --> 5453.039
letters early-bird number 245 yeah we'll

5451.239 --> 5454.869
see what happens in the afternoon maybe

5453.039 --> 5458.13
Jose is gonna do something I don't know

5454.869 --> 5463.449
we'll see what happens but I I'm gonna

5458.13 --> 5465.459
get a lunch break now at least and since

5463.449 --> 5468.489
there is really nobody getting on with

5465.459 --> 5473.949
me that's yeah that's that so yeah I

5468.489 --> 5475.079
hope to see you all tomorrow and until

5473.949 --> 5480.808999999999
the next video

5475.079 --> 5480.808999999999
hashtag meifa of course and keep it flat
