[Music]

205.22 --> 209.35999999999999
yeah it's a pretty heavy

209.76 --> 212.78
evening yesterday

213.239 --> 219.54
I mean yeah it just same as usual but uh

217.14 --> 221.7
yeah the beers I got hit me really hard

219.54 --> 224.64
for some reason

221.7 --> 227.39999999999998
I just I was just listening back to Jim

224.64 --> 229.26
Bobs because I got on there again

227.4 --> 230.94
quite a bit

229.26 --> 233.48
and it was

230.94 --> 236.099
I mean it was good what I said was good

233.48 --> 237.959
interesting I was like almost kind of

236.099 --> 240.0
lost in fractal thinking

237.959 --> 241.98
so

240.0 --> 245.04
but it was a bit slurry and that's

241.98 --> 247.61999999999998
freaking annoying when that happens

245.04 --> 249.959
I don't think Jim Bob really mined it

247.62 --> 251.64000000000001
because my mind was pretty creative and

249.959 --> 256.099
all that so

251.64 --> 256.099
but yeah I went on Jim Bob last night

256.28 --> 260.57899999999995
late evening

258.359 --> 263.71999999999997

260.579 --> 263.72
so check that out

265.62 --> 270.84000000000003

267.78 --> 273.0

270.84 --> 277.94
was just amazing

273.0 --> 277.94
right but anyway I get on that

280.56 --> 285.139

282.78 --> 285.13899999999995
annoying

290.26 --> 295.86
[Music]

[Music]

333.16 --> 339.18
[Music]

336.9 --> 340.919
all right and then oh God in the middle

339.18 --> 343.68
of the night

340.919 --> 345.18
ah almost makes me sick just thinking

343.68 --> 350.52
about because it was just way too late

345.18 --> 354.0
for me or QE went on this enormous rant

350.52 --> 357.539
reviewing Whitsett

354.0 --> 360.96
and it was I mean d was just like

357.539 --> 362.759
ravaging him I mean seriously and like

360.96 --> 364.85999999999996
people are not even probably gonna

362.759 --> 367.97900000000004
recognize on the other side like what's

364.86 --> 370.199
just what just happened

367.979 --> 371.88
gonna be very polarized against it you

370.199 --> 373.5
could already even see it in the trolls

371.88 --> 374.82
and chat and all that

373.5 --> 378.12
but

374.82 --> 380.09999999999997
yeah that happened

378.12 --> 381.72
I didn't watch it all because I needed

380.1 --> 386.06
to go to bed and that's not like the

381.72 --> 386.06
thing you want to go to bed with

389.28 --> 392.539
stable diffusions what

393.3 --> 397.199
what show

395.4 --> 401.59999999999997
with Joe dank

397.199 --> 401.6
I mean kiwi or you mean me and Jim Over

410.66 --> 415.28000000000003
the phone speaker exploding

419.52 --> 427.4
no I mean QE has gone like has gone to a

424.56 --> 427.4
full grunt mode

428.34 --> 432.78
I think I've only heard him like this to

430.68 --> 435.979
this level like one time before which

432.78 --> 435.979
was like years ago

437.16 --> 440.41900000000004
but damn

443.4 --> 448.4
yeah I know we ran late I did check the

445.86 --> 452.84000000000003
video to see how long it was with

448.4 --> 452.84
way too long for me this is

453.06 --> 456.24
you wanted to sleep as well it's up to

455.039 --> 460.21999999999997
you

456.24 --> 460.22
you know you don't have to watch it live

461.46 --> 466.21999999999997
it was pretty much unannounced as well

463.8 --> 466.22
so

466.34 --> 470.11999999999995
apjc that could see you

476.16 --> 483.36
I don't know that movie what

479.58 --> 484.979
anyway you need to breathe for a bit it

483.36 --> 487.699
was heavy and I don't really want to get

484.979 --> 487.699
into it thanks

488.22 --> 490.88000000000005
uh

490.919 --> 497.52
I mean let kiwi just do what he does and

494.639 --> 500.46000000000004
it serves a function it's just not

497.52 --> 502.68
something I really want to like stare at

500.46 --> 503.58
and absorb too much if you know what I

502.68 --> 506.63
mean

503.58 --> 506.63
[Music]

546.98 --> 554.12
ah is it good to absorb some of that sun

550.459 --> 554.1199999999999
which has come back

569.339 --> 576.32
okay

571.86 --> 576.32
an X figures physics teacher

577.92 --> 587.3
so they went up was he like a baller

582.12 --> 587.3
I mean yeah that that sounds interesting

590.86 --> 596.0600000000001
[Music]

593.64 --> 596.06
Maybe

600.48 --> 604.519
oh Brian that sounds familiar

611.1 --> 614.0
huh

618.06 --> 622.51
right that well that sounds very typical

620.64 --> 626.08
Terry

622.51 --> 626.08
[Music]

628.36 --> 634.889
[Music]

647.94 --> 650.94
foreign

678.66 --> 683.6
all right has anybody by the way heard

680.7 --> 683.6
of lva pull

687.3 --> 691.4399999999999
I think something might have happened to

688.98 --> 692.82
like his computer or something

691.44 --> 694.74
because

692.82 --> 697.98
without saying anything he basically

694.74 --> 700.76
dropped from all the Skype rooms

697.98 --> 700.76
that was weird

701.459 --> 705.8389999999999
so yeah

703.14 --> 707.579
keep an eye out

705.839 --> 710.7600000000001
I don't know he might still be like on

707.579 --> 714.1999999999999
Gilbert or something but

710.76 --> 714.2
yeah I'm a little worried

714.54 --> 719.9399999999999
I mean he's been a great guy so far it's

717.6 --> 723.62
been great to have him in chat too so I

719.94 --> 723.62
hope nothing is seriously wrong

726.899 --> 732.36
he got banned from YouTube

729.839 --> 734.839
what

732.36 --> 734.839
really

750.66 --> 752.8389999999999
thank you

756.54 --> 761.899
he told you when

759.3 --> 761.899
okay

766.26 --> 769.459
well that's a bummer

778.92 --> 784.86
wait Tuesday that long oh well he hadn't

782.22 --> 787.0790000000001
said anything

784.86 --> 788.4590000000001
or I think he might have dropped

787.079 --> 791.459
something once

788.459 --> 794.4799999999999
but I think I overlooked it but I don't

791.459 --> 794.4799999999999
know where he's gone

805.079 --> 810.5999999999999
hey PG crochet

807.54 --> 812.2199999999999
yeah late late night last night yeah I

810.6 --> 814.9200000000001
bet

812.22 --> 817.74
I didn't go to bed too late but it was

814.92 --> 820.62
still it was just overall intense I went

817.74 --> 822.48
on Jim Bob's

820.62 --> 825.139
and

822.48 --> 827.76
I now didn't eat very well

825.139 --> 829.139
thank God I don't have any coffee I

827.76 --> 832.019
probably would have had one of those and

829.139 --> 835.04
that would have made it worse

832.019 --> 835.04
but uh

838.019 --> 842.18
yeah I'm a bit woozy but am I right

844.94 --> 849.019
yeah I can't find this channel

849.12 --> 852.48
like

850.56 --> 854.779
I was talking I was subscribed to him

852.48 --> 854.779
but

856.139 --> 862.1
find his name in the list

859.32 --> 862.1
it's weird

865.62 --> 871.339
[Music]

867.12 --> 871.339
does anybody have a link to his channel

882.3 --> 885.899
okay I think I might have just not been

884.399 --> 888.06
subscribed to him

885.899 --> 891.26
I am subscribed to like the streaming

888.06 --> 891.26
Channel they share though

891.959 --> 895.76
I said refracted philosophy

903.6 --> 908.36
yeah I can't find his his channel

910.62 --> 913.1
right

914.76 --> 923.0
also killed it yesterday

917.76 --> 923.0
now he was even like on my show

923.16 --> 929.279
in the chat

925.62 --> 932.04
but yeah this morning I looked and

929.279 --> 935.18
noticed like he had left

932.04 --> 935.18
on the chat rooms

937.399 --> 942.12
uh yeah early this morning

940.68 --> 945.079
like

942.12 --> 945.079
somewhere between

946.22 --> 954.38
7 A.M and 12 P.M

951.72 --> 954.38
so

960.48 --> 966.899
I don't know he might have just like

963.48 --> 970.139
been so disappointed that he literally

966.899 --> 971.94
gave up like the entire project and he

970.139 --> 974.1
might have just like [ __ ] this I'm gonna

971.94 --> 976.9200000000001
get this job or something I I don't know

974.1 --> 979.019
I mean the guy is a very

976.92 --> 982.199
it has like

979.019 --> 986.12
an ambitious spirit

982.199 --> 986.12
so he might have just done that

986.279 --> 991.26
basically done what I sometimes like to

988.98 --> 993.36
say I might do and that's like [ __ ] all

991.26 --> 996.56
this I'm gonna do something else you

993.36 --> 996.5600000000001
might have done that I don't know

997.92 --> 1002.66
I mean it's a total bummer if his

999.959 --> 1006.6389999999999
channel just gets deleted

1002.66 --> 1006.639
but anyway if you can

1007.579 --> 1013.16
find a link to his channel that would be

1011.12 --> 1015.199
great I mean I could probably dig it up

1013.16 --> 1018.68
by just going

1015.199 --> 1021.7589999999999
in the chat of my own show

1018.68 --> 1021.7589999999999
from like yesterday

1022.82 --> 1028.179
but maybe some of you just have it more

1025.579 --> 1028.1789999999999
readily available

1036.88 --> 1042.3190000000002
right dank yeah ambition and good nature

1040.339 --> 1044.72
which is like a really beautiful

1042.319 --> 1047.0
combination

1044.72 --> 1049.34
it's kind of rare or maybe it isn't as

1047.0 --> 1052.64
rare as I think but it was great

1049.34 --> 1055.4189999999999
I yeah felt like wow this is a great guy

1052.64 --> 1055.419
to have on board

1057.32 --> 1063.559
so I hope he's not like leaving forever

1061.4 --> 1066.5
but yeah I don't know I haven't heard

1063.559 --> 1069.82
from him so

1066.5 --> 1069.82
figure it out eventually

1074.78 --> 1080.799
most likely banned foretelling the truth

1077.48 --> 1080.799
with YouTube yeah but how

1084.5 --> 1087.82
how does that work

1091.98 --> 1096.08
[Music]

1094.4 --> 1098.98
actively encourages people to

1096.08 --> 1098.98
participate yeah

1124.22 --> 1126.4
foreign

1131.679 --> 1138.3400000000001
yeah

1133.34 --> 1138.34
well yeah it might be like Brandon

1140.96 --> 1144.3400000000001
but yeah we don't know

1149.799 --> 1154.76
was he from New Zealand

1153.5 --> 1157.78
huh

1154.76 --> 1157.78
I didn't know that

1158.0 --> 1161.02
I hadn't picked up

1172.16 --> 1178.039
wow okay if it's if he's over there then

1175.22 --> 1180.08
this might be not even like YouTube

1178.039 --> 1182.12
related this might literally be the

1180.08 --> 1183.74
government that's just being freaking

1182.12 --> 1185.78
Nazis

1183.74 --> 1186.86
let's hope not

1185.78 --> 1190.76
foreign

1186.86 --> 1194.0
let's not try to go towards Imagining

1190.76 --> 1196.48

1260.539 --> 1265.34
that would be asking for trouble

1263.419 --> 1269.8600000000001
Maybe

1265.34 --> 1269.86
I mean in over there it would

1271.88 --> 1276.5
yeah I know

1273.74 --> 1280.78
she's from

1276.5 --> 1280.78
young global leaders

1297.1 --> 1303.74
okay well PG scene I look I'm just

1300.32 --> 1307.72
wondering like what did lva Paul do to

1303.74 --> 1307.72
deserve that [ __ ] I mean seriously

1309.38 --> 1315.38
guys like the most friendly and durable

1313.039 --> 1319.6589999999999
person that I've ever come across pretty

1315.38 --> 1319.659
much like the least triggerable

1320.48 --> 1325.88
very very focused

1323.36 --> 1331.24
so I can't imagine like what what would

1325.88 --> 1331.24
he have done to like get cracked down on

1331.58 --> 1338.72
so anyway let's not over speculate this

1335.659 --> 1341.38
just gonna have to wait to get some

1338.72 --> 1341.38
communication

1350.08 --> 1354.1589999999999
okay PJ Cruise Shank

1358.76 --> 1362.799
sorry for another subject YouTube then

1363.679 --> 1369.02
yeah but what

1366.14 --> 1371.0590000000002
yeah but how I mean people talk about

1369.02 --> 1374.32
this all the time I talk about

1371.059 --> 1374.32
everything all the time

1375.32 --> 1381.019
I don't get it

1377.94 --> 1381.019
[Music]

1381.08 --> 1387.74
besides I don't think he even like

1383.179 --> 1389.9
screamed on his own

1387.74 --> 1392.36
platform like on his own channel he you

1389.9 --> 1395.659
would like join stream so

1392.36 --> 1397.3999999999999
how does that even work then I just I'm

1395.659 --> 1400.48
really kind of baffled as to what's

1397.4 --> 1400.48
really going on here

1402.46 --> 1406.64
[Music]

1403.82 --> 1410.0
right but one thing that I do suspect

1406.64 --> 1412.2800000000002
which might be even worse but also less

1410.0 --> 1414.2
worse on the long run is that could be

1412.28 --> 1416.299
that his account or his computer was

1414.2 --> 1418.1000000000001
just hacked

1416.299 --> 1420.26
and he rushed things a little bit too

1418.1 --> 1422.6589999999999
much and then somebody basically just

1420.26 --> 1424.46
slipped in

1422.659 --> 1425.2990000000002
and deleted everything that could be it

1424.46 --> 1429.46
too

1425.299 --> 1429.46
right it's freaking annoying

1430.64 --> 1439.4
but that does match

1433.96 --> 1441.8600000000001
actively leaving Skype rooms because

1439.4 --> 1443.659
otherwise yeah the only other

1441.86 --> 1445.28
alternative I could think of why he

1443.659 --> 1448.22
would do that is if he was certainly

1445.28 --> 1450.2
really pissed and like had to basically

1448.22 --> 1452.38
Rage Quit to get another job or

1450.2 --> 1452.38
something

1454.28 --> 1456.94
so

1457.039 --> 1461.419
yeah

1458.659 --> 1464.6000000000001
it has been a week of confusion it's a

1461.419 --> 1467.919
little I don't know what's going on

1464.6 --> 1467.9189999999999
you just have to wait to see

1467.96 --> 1472.179
is this the beings on everything no

1472.28 --> 1475.84
wait what beans

1476.419 --> 1481.72
no no no no no no I well not that I know

1479.36 --> 1484.839
of I mean what

1481.72 --> 1484.839
[Music]

1491.36 --> 1493.7199999999998
what

1494.059 --> 1502.52
that would be weird look like what no

1499.34 --> 1507.3999999999999
no this is about lva poll just basically

1502.52 --> 1507.4
dropping from all the Skype chats and

1510.74 --> 1515.559
he hasn't really responded so I don't

1512.78 --> 1515.559
know what's going on

1519.28 --> 1522.94
[Music]

1527.059 --> 1532.6589999999999
thank you

1528.74 --> 1532.659
hey LSG good to see you

1534.98 --> 1538.4
someone had spilled no

1537.09 --> 1540.98
[Music]

1538.4 --> 1544.159
no I think that's it's a little bit too

1540.98 --> 1546.74
complicated land on Linux because

1544.159 --> 1548.48
I still don't know exactly what is going

1546.74 --> 1550.58
on

1548.48 --> 1553.46
I mean the spilling the beans May simply

1550.58 --> 1555.86
be a joke among the guys because I I'm

1553.46 --> 1559.419
not I don't think like Adam meekin

1555.86 --> 1559.4189999999999
actually knows what's going on either

1561.02 --> 1564.1589999999999
I'm not sure

1566.36 --> 1568.9599999999998
right

1571.88 --> 1578.0590000000002
hey yeah I'm making

1574.64 --> 1581.44
hi good see you yeah I was I was just uh

1578.059 --> 1581.44
gossiping about you

1592.94 --> 1595.94
foreign

1596.43 --> 1599.66
[Music]

1632.48 --> 1639.1
well they just seen it there might be it

1634.94 --> 1639.1000000000001
I think that Nathan might be

1641.659 --> 1647.0590000000002
just kind of like

1644.179 --> 1650.0590000000002
leaving it open on purpose I mean

1647.059 --> 1653.299
there's now a sort of talk team war

1650.059 --> 1657.559
going on here situation

1653.299 --> 1660.559
it's him and jiren and with Sid and

1657.559 --> 1660.559
QE

1660.62 --> 1664.4599999999998
those are the ones that are kind of

1662.539 --> 1667.52
engaging in this really

1664.46 --> 1671.96
right so

1667.52 --> 1674.779
yeah I mean he Nathan knows like there's

1671.96 --> 1677.48
basically now just spies

1674.779 --> 1680.299
not with among our ranks but literally

1677.48 --> 1683.72
eyes there's just eyes at aimed at all

1680.299 --> 1685.8799999999999
of this we've I've seen this

1683.72 --> 1688.1000000000001
I mean it might be whitsid as somebody

1685.88 --> 1689.0590000000002
which it goes around with sock accounts

1688.1 --> 1692.1789999999999
too

1689.059 --> 1694.039
and he seems to be like kind of stalking

1692.179 --> 1695.8400000000001
the chat well yeah of course it's it's

1694.039 --> 1698.74
probably if he can be there

1695.84 --> 1698.74
but

1699.08 --> 1703.34
he has also misbehaves had to ban him a

1701.6 --> 1706.039
couple of times in there

1703.34 --> 1710.559
but there's eyes on fvd

1706.039 --> 1710.559
because of the situation Nathan knows it

1710.96 --> 1716.059
now I don't know what Nathan is actually

1713.419 --> 1718.3400000000001
planning with this

1716.059 --> 1720.02
but I get a feeling that he is and that

1718.34 --> 1722.299
is what the spilling the beans is about

1720.02 --> 1725.62
and I don't think anybody but Nathan

1722.299 --> 1725.62
actually knows what the plan is

1726.7 --> 1730.1200000000001
it's all fine

1732.98 --> 1738.279
as long as he goes back alive on Monday

1735.5 --> 1738.279
damn it

1743.24 --> 1748.4
I hope he's watching the sense fights

1745.64 --> 1751.3400000000001
now it's yet look spies is a big word

1748.4 --> 1753.38
right we talk about spies you're talking

1751.34 --> 1755.36
about infiltrators really and that's not

1753.38 --> 1758.1200000000001
the case it's just it's an open show

1755.36 --> 1761.4799999999998
people can watch it now

1758.12 --> 1765.3799999999999
in this case there is eyes on it

1761.48 --> 1768.32
because of the tug team

1765.38 --> 1769.8990000000001
situation between ball busters and

1768.32 --> 1774.399
globusters team

1769.899 --> 1774.399
so that's what I'm talking about

1775.22 --> 1780.279
just like information attention Dynamics

1782.659 --> 1785.659
anyway

1785.779 --> 1793.1
we're gonna get some back ah

1789.14 --> 1797.0
yuck I'm gonna get some backup teeth

1793.1 --> 1800.1999999999998
[Music]

1797.0 --> 1800.2
burst yuck

1800.36 --> 1803.1999999999998
I'll be right back

1846.98 --> 1849.159
okay

1872.419 --> 1874.659
foreign

1909.74 --> 1912.22
cool

1928.94 --> 1931.659
thank you

1934.539 --> 1938.26
and look at that

1939.38 --> 1943.94
it

1940.94 --> 1943.94
is

1946.29 --> 1954.46
[Music]

1951.279 --> 1954.46
inch man

1972.44 --> 1977.6000000000001
what which it blocked you Sage man

1976.039 --> 1980.2
really

1977.6 --> 1980.1999999999998
what

1980.36 --> 1983.1999999999998
that's weird

1989.72 --> 1994.519
right yeah so

1991.76 --> 1997.7
you do have to kind of keep in mind that

1994.519 --> 2000.94
because a lot of you guys hang around in

1997.7 --> 2003.5800000000002
my chat too and at fed but including the

2000.94 --> 2004.8990000000001
ones that even don't even like fpd all

2003.58 --> 2006.1589999999999
that much

2004.899 --> 2008.5189999999998
right

2006.159 --> 2011.98
if you hang around me

2008.519 --> 2015.0
they'll be like glowbuster people will

2011.98 --> 2015.0
be suspicious of you

2015.159 --> 2022.0
they think I might be like psionically

2018.399 --> 2023.7399999999998
mind controlling you to be my agents or

2022.0 --> 2027.7
something that probably not well maybe

2023.74 --> 2030.3990000000001
they secretly think that I don't know

2027.7 --> 2033.46
I mean I do kind of like Inspire pretty

2030.399 --> 2037.6589999999999
wild imaginations about myself

2033.46 --> 2040.539
so they might just think that

2037.659 --> 2043.0590000000002
but if that is the case then I'm

2040.539 --> 2044.98
assuring you whoever's listening that I

2043.059 --> 2047.3799999999999
am not consciously aware about this is

2044.98 --> 2049.78
if this is the case

2047.38 --> 2053.379
so maybe my subconscious is planning

2049.78 --> 2056.76
such a thing but I am not aware of it

2053.379 --> 2056.7599999999998
yeah chew on that

2057.82 --> 2062.88
anyway

2059.75 --> 2062.88
[Music]

2067.32 --> 2078.6690000000003
[Applause]

2068.81 --> 2078.669
[Music]

2079.119 --> 2084.2200000000003
people that like the drama TV shows

2081.82 --> 2087.04
should watch Flat Earth

2084.22 --> 2090.22
yeah but the thing about it is that

2087.04 --> 2093.46
drama TV

2090.22 --> 2094.7799999999997
they make it more aesthetic

2093.46 --> 2097.06
you see

2094.78 --> 2099.52
real world drama

2097.06 --> 2101.7999999999997
it has its moments it's very interesting

2099.52 --> 2103.9
and you learn a lot but it also gets

2101.8 --> 2108.52
really freaking ugly

2103.9 --> 2111.4
and drama on TV series like they don't

2108.52 --> 2113.98
actually do that because that literally

2111.4 --> 2115.48
breaks the spirit and just holds things

2113.98 --> 2117.16
which is part of the psychological

2115.48 --> 2118.66
struggle

2117.16 --> 2122.2599999999998
right

2118.66 --> 2124.359
of the actual process of drama and

2122.26 --> 2126.3390000000004
getting in each other's hair is that it

2124.359 --> 2128.94
actually halts the [ __ ] out of the

2126.339 --> 2133.68
situation and is demoralizing

2128.94 --> 2137.94
so drama on TV is well

2133.68 --> 2137.94
dramatized made more aesthetic

2140.56 --> 2144.24
the real drama I mean

2145.48 --> 2152.2
it has its moments I guess I've had like

2148.44 --> 2154.599
wildly yeah enjoyable mobile enjoyable

2152.2 --> 2157.48
where it was just really funny I felt

2154.599 --> 2158.56
like I was a little devil dancing on the

2157.48 --> 2162.28
flames

2158.56 --> 2165.04
like and I knew I I can't get hurt here

2162.28 --> 2168.9
and that's been hilarious but

2165.04 --> 2172.48
it also just has this this boggy

2168.9 --> 2174.099
slimy sticky uh

2172.48 --> 2178.42
draining

2174.099 --> 2181.02
aspect to it that I absolutely despise

2178.42 --> 2181.02
so

2181.359 --> 2189.46
real life drama is a lot more draining

2184.78 --> 2192.6600000000003
than like fictional drama on TV and in

2189.46 --> 2196.66
books because real drama actually sucks

2192.66 --> 2196.66
literally anyway

2197.859 --> 2202.44
did Neil die from with Charles yeah

2210.099 --> 2215.52
yeah

2211.599 --> 2215.52
I did get a bit hard on Neo yesterday

2215.859 --> 2221.56
but I did also apologize for that I I

2218.44 --> 2223.42
mean he is he he is no he's not dying

2221.56 --> 2226.42
from withdrawals but he is definitely

2223.42 --> 2227.2000000000003
just gonna damn it I need my fad and

2226.42 --> 2229.48
like

2227.2 --> 2231.8799999999997
you don't have any replacement for that

2229.48 --> 2233.859
so it's not like oh we'll we'll get

2231.88 --> 2236.46
there's this alternative it's not as

2233.859 --> 2240.339
good but it will have to do like

2236.46 --> 2242.92
methadone at like heroin clinics

2240.339 --> 2243.88
right there's no such thing with fed it

2242.92 --> 2246.28
is

2243.88 --> 2249.42
pretty much Irreplaceable and new ways

2246.28 --> 2249.42
very much

2249.88 --> 2254.98
socially addictive

2252.579 --> 2258.04
he's just really into it and in a way I

2254.98 --> 2259.42
have to say I am too I'm not that that

2258.04 --> 2262.0
much

2259.42 --> 2264.88
but I def I feel it definitely that like

2262.0 --> 2268.02
no life shows I feel kind of like well

2264.88 --> 2268.02
isolated now

2268.3 --> 2271.42
because there's no second part of what

2270.52 --> 2273.94
I'm doing

2271.42 --> 2277.119
right normally I had to do my show I

2273.94 --> 2278.68
perform personally I have my bit of

2277.119 --> 2282.099
calmed

2278.68 --> 2284.859
safe space yo yes I use the word little

2282.099 --> 2288.96
safe space that I create for myself

2284.859 --> 2288.96
right but it's not like

2289.42 --> 2293.04
it's that's not a safe space

2293.38 --> 2299.56
well partially

2296.32 --> 2301.3
pedo [ __ ] like definitely this is a safe

2299.56 --> 2302.859
space against that

2301.3 --> 2305.4
but

2302.859 --> 2305.4
foreign

2308.859 --> 2312.42
what the hell was I talking about

2312.82 --> 2317.5
yeah withdrawals from fpd I'm missing it

2315.04 --> 2319.66
because because the second

2317.5 --> 2321.76
like I'm just used to doing my show and

2319.66 --> 2324.8199999999997
then afterward fed

2321.76 --> 2328.599
which is a very different approach like

2324.82 --> 2331.96
I use other aspects of myself so I can

2328.599 --> 2335.02
like do let this wind down and speak

2331.96 --> 2337.599
less and use a more secondary position

2335.02 --> 2339.339
quick commentary basically I like how I

2337.599 --> 2341.02
conduct myself in chats it's another

2339.339 --> 2342.7599999999998
position

2341.02 --> 2344.22
it's a much more

2342.76 --> 2347.46
socially

2344.22 --> 2347.4599999999996
beta-oriented position

2350.8 --> 2353.3390000000004
right

2355.359 --> 2361.839
or yeah beta Delta anyway I'm missing

2360.04 --> 2363.7599999999998
fev2

2361.839 --> 2367.66
and I feel a little bit isolated because

2363.76 --> 2370.8590000000004
of that but I mean I can get around like

2367.66 --> 2370.859
a ball win or reach what

2376.24 --> 2381.16
well fed actually allows me to be

2379.359 --> 2384.5789999999997
Ballwin more

2381.16 --> 2388.1189999999997
as a sparring partner for the guys

2384.579 --> 2390.46
and Ray twin I'd never do there I leave

2388.119 --> 2392.7000000000003
that pretty much exclusive to my own

2390.46 --> 2392.7
show

2395.98 --> 2398.579
you know

2399.46 --> 2403.7400000000002
I'm not gonna do gaming streams

2406.119 --> 2413.8
right I use ball window nephew yes I do

2409.0 --> 2417.7
do it also here sometimes it's just

2413.8 --> 2420.28
the real bowling can only come out when

2417.7 --> 2422.52
there is an opponent right that's the

2420.28 --> 2422.52
point

2427.96 --> 2432.9
just doing bowling on your own is not

2430.72 --> 2435.7
doesn't do anything

2432.9 --> 2437.5
well it does a little

2435.7 --> 2440.56
but

2437.5 --> 2442.96
yeah it's not a you can't really do it

2440.56 --> 2445.66
you can't really be

2442.96 --> 2448.119
ball win unless you're like up against

2445.66 --> 2451.0
somebody that's trying to break your

2448.119 --> 2452.859
dream trying to show you how you're

2451.0 --> 2455.2
incorrect and

2452.859 --> 2458.14
right it's a process

2455.2 --> 2461.3799999999997
it's not just a

2458.14 --> 2464.3199999999997
stance it's a process

2461.38 --> 2468.46
anyway it takes two yeah well it it can

2464.32 --> 2470.619
take one but it really manifests with

2468.46 --> 2473.44
yeah more than one person if you're up

2470.619 --> 2475.839
against somebody in a conversation right

2473.44 --> 2480.04
for all kinds of reasons I mean for a

2475.839 --> 2484.619
joke or for intellectual challenge

2480.04 --> 2487.7799999999997
right and pl also for

2484.619 --> 2489.82
sensibility alertness training right

2487.78 --> 2492.0400000000004
Nathan really likes to do this and he

2489.82 --> 2494.6800000000003
even he gets so enthusiastic about it

2492.04 --> 2496.96
that he sometimes like has an entire

2494.68 --> 2499.7799999999997
conspiracy idea about what I'm trying to

2496.96 --> 2502.119
do with balwyn when I'm not actually

2499.78 --> 2505.599
doing that I mean a lot of my ball in

2502.119 --> 2507.88
actions are purely spontaneous I don't

2505.599 --> 2510.099
have a plan that is like hanging

2507.88 --> 2513.339
secretly in the background I don't this

2510.099 --> 2515.02
is all mechanical what I do

2513.339 --> 2518.32
this is

2515.02 --> 2520.599
and it well yeah so Nathan sometimes

2518.32 --> 2521.7400000000002
thinks that I'm being Baldwin when I'm

2520.599 --> 2523.96
not

2521.74 --> 2526.0
also he sometimes thinks I'm being

2523.96 --> 2527.68
Baldwin when I'm actually trying to make

2526.0 --> 2529.9
a serious point that is kind of

2527.68 --> 2531.94
controversial

2529.9 --> 2534.04
and then that is kind of an annoying

2531.94 --> 2535.26
straw man it's like no I'm not being

2534.04 --> 2538.8
Baldwin

2535.26 --> 2541.7200000000003
I mean you guys have heard me on the FED

2538.8 --> 2543.52
like that before

2541.72 --> 2547.0
uh-huh

2543.52 --> 2549.42
what arrangement for press what are you

2547.0 --> 2549.42
insane

2549.64 --> 2552.359
what

2558.7 --> 2562.14
Guru Arwin

2565.54 --> 2569.4
what's engine is that a joke

2570.18 --> 2579.1189999999997
the famous flat earther that's hilarious

2575.079 --> 2579.119
I mean famous is a big word

2581.44 --> 2584.52

who's doing that

2653.38 --> 2658.9
yeah I see it it's on Facebook though so

2656.56 --> 2662.16
I can't really get in there but I guess

2658.9 --> 2662.1600000000003
I'll share that that's weird

2665.079 --> 2667.6800000000003
see that

2675.94 --> 2679.96
foreign

2678.339 --> 2683.2599999999998
weird

2679.96 --> 2685.9
I no I'm not on Facebook I've like done

2683.26 --> 2689.8190000000004
my best to avoid Facebook from the very

2685.9 --> 2689.819
start I've never actually gone there

2690.46 --> 2695.88
I knew about Facebook like very early on

2698.02 --> 2702.3
and I'm like I'm not going on there

2705.48 --> 2710.56
we don't have time for a meeting with

2708.579 --> 2714.52
the Arwin

2710.56 --> 2717.42
Society what are we the earth now it

2714.52 --> 2717.42
doesn't make any sense

2718.78 --> 2721.92
hilarious though

2724.119 --> 2729.04
fight the Flat Earth made a lot of

2726.04 --> 2731.079
videos about he did

2729.04 --> 2733.42
really

2731.079 --> 2735.819
about how he thinks I'm a crazy person

2733.42 --> 2739.119
probably and have anger issues probably

2735.819 --> 2741.52
I mean I mean yeah

2739.119 --> 2744.88
it's right there for the picking if you

2741.52 --> 2747.64
really want to do that with me

2744.88 --> 2750.88
I mean I'll give you whatever you need

2747.64 --> 2753.339
to convince yourself that I'm not worthy

2750.88 --> 2756.099
listening to and that I'm crazy if you

2753.339 --> 2758.5
really want that

2756.099 --> 2760.6600000000003
but if you're not interested in just

2758.5 --> 2761.68
finding a way to get rid of me in your

2760.66 --> 2764.74
mind

2761.68 --> 2767.7
then you might find that I have a lot of

2764.74 --> 2767.7
interesting ideas

2776.17 --> 2780.28
[Music]

2777.52 --> 2781.3
right so anyway whoever's doing that on

2780.28 --> 2785.6400000000003
Facebook

2781.3 --> 2785.6400000000003
I have no idea who it's not me

2792.339 --> 2797.52
this is the first time I'm uh I'm

2794.859 --> 2797.52
hearing about it

2804.89 --> 2808.15
[Music]

2822.339 --> 2827.7
what

2825.099 --> 2827.7000000000003
huh

2832.859 --> 2837.52
what are you talking about did you see

2835.359 --> 2839.94
that

2837.52 --> 2844.2
what

2839.94 --> 2844.2000000000003
sixth on the Google search

2852.76 --> 2856.7200000000003
okay so somebody there I guess really

2855.28 --> 2859.3190000000004
likes me

2856.72 --> 2859.319
cool

2866.079 --> 2872.8
I hope they're not getting too weird

2869.819 --> 2875.319
I mean I know I get weird but I've

2872.8 --> 2877.78
always been very clear like hey guys

2875.319 --> 2880.119
like I share things but I don't

2877.78 --> 2881.6800000000003
necessarily recommend you try to be like

2880.119 --> 2884.5
me or anything

2881.68 --> 2886.7799999999997
just try to learn from what I'm doing

2884.5 --> 2889.74
and I might just give you tips right but

2886.78 --> 2894.099
like I don't really recommend being me

2889.74 --> 2896.2599999999998
it's not exactly the most enjoyable

2894.099 --> 2900.819
format

2896.26 --> 2903.42
I basically became this because well it

2900.819 --> 2903.42
was necessary

2909.22 --> 2913.74
anyway but yeah interesting

2928.5 --> 2935.16
about the thousands yeah I know but that

2931.24 --> 2935.16
was that was really amazing

2935.44 --> 2940.599
I mean the Thousand subscriber ran I I

2938.2 --> 2943.2999999999997
totally deserved everything that came

2940.599 --> 2945.28
out of that and I am already I was

2943.3 --> 2947.6800000000003
pretty quickly there but at the position

2945.28 --> 2949.8390000000004
where I can absolutely laugh about it

2947.68 --> 2953.859
with everybody that's laughing about it

2949.839 --> 2956.44
because it was really silly I really

2953.859 --> 2958.42
meant it but it was really silly in

2956.44 --> 2960.579
retrospect

2958.42 --> 2966.04
so

2960.579 --> 2967.0600000000004
yeah I get it it was freaking hilarious

2966.04 --> 2970.23
so

2967.06 --> 2970.23
[Music]

2980.83 --> 2984.0099999999998
[Music]

2984.099 --> 2988.78
it's even sillier now because now I'm in

2987.04 --> 2993.339
like

2988.78 --> 2996.2200000000003
I'm at 2.53 K subscribers and I've

2993.339 --> 2999.099
turned off the Super Chat which was the

2996.22 --> 3003.56
reason why I wanted to turn it on

2999.099 --> 3003.56
so that makes it even more silly

3039.3 --> 3041.96
what

3042.24 --> 3049.3999999999996
fight the flatters things me and flat

3045.06 --> 3049.4
side are high priests what

3050.819 --> 3053.3
well

3054.9 --> 3058.28
High Priests of what

3058.619 --> 3063.1400000000003
I mean I think sometimes I'm a high

3060.78 --> 3063.1400000000003
priest

3066.18 --> 3068.94
I

3067.319 --> 3071.64
try to

3068.94 --> 3075.7400000000002
sort of do something like that

3071.64 --> 3075.74
it's just that I'm yeah not

3079.2 --> 3085.2
I never aim to be like big and wide and

3082.2 --> 3087.66
super connected and all that so

3085.2 --> 3090.319
I'm just trying to really focus on doing

3087.66 --> 3090.319
what I do

3094.859 --> 3099.42
yes then Linux it does

3097.319 --> 3104.0
social credit

3099.42 --> 3104.0
uh my welfare yeah

3112.46 --> 3118.44
[Music]

3114.14 --> 3120.7799999999997
right but hey if I be like

3118.44 --> 3122.76
getting more support from you guys and

3120.78 --> 3125.1600000000003
it would be like really a substantial

3122.76 --> 3127.2000000000003
amount and I'm not saying that you

3125.16 --> 3129.359
aren't actually helping me out because

3127.2 --> 3131.8799999999997
you are I'm still getting by which is

3129.359 --> 3134.2799999999997
kind of a miracle to me really that

3131.88 --> 3136.92
that's working

3134.28 --> 3140.3590000000004
but yeah it's like the amount would

3136.92 --> 3143.579
let's say increase tenfold

3140.359 --> 3146.88
yeah I'm not saying that I don't know

3143.579 --> 3148.92
that just I mean that would be an

3146.88 --> 3150.3
entirely different Financial picture and

3148.92 --> 3153.54
then I would

3150.3 --> 3156.6600000000003
also be able to get off the welfare

3153.54 --> 3159.0
and also super chats would then suddenly

3156.66 --> 3162.18
also no longer be deducted

3159.0 --> 3164.339
so yeah but that situation has not

3162.18 --> 3167.359
exactly arrived

3164.339 --> 3167.359
if you know what I mean

3168.0 --> 3173.16
so maybe I could say not there yet

3171.24 --> 3175.74
but

3173.16 --> 3179.7599999999998
yeah I'm not I'm just not

3175.74 --> 3183.7799999999997
ready to get my hopes up

3179.76 --> 3186.059
this is a slow slow Journey

3183.78 --> 3190.1600000000003
it has been thus far and yeah I'm just

3186.059 --> 3190.1600000000003
gonna keep it steady anyway

3208.14 --> 3216.5989999999997
oh what he thinks that you think I'm you

3212.579 --> 3219.42
I'm your high priest okay

3216.599 --> 3221.2200000000003
that's hilarious

3219.42 --> 3223.64
so what does he think about his own

3221.22 --> 3223.64
followers

3223.92 --> 3228.7200000000003
does he think that he is their high

3226.26 --> 3230.46
priest then

3228.72 --> 3231.9599999999996
because I could make an argument for

3230.46 --> 3234.44
that

3231.96 --> 3234.44
right

3248.579 --> 3250.94
right

3252.96 --> 3257.88
now the thing about it look the thing is

3255.359 --> 3259.38
that what makes a high priest typically

3257.88 --> 3262.319
a high priest

3259.38 --> 3265.02
is that they impose their will

3262.319 --> 3267.24
that they say you have to do this

3265.02 --> 3269.72
I don't actually do that although I do

3267.24 --> 3269.72
like

3270.359 --> 3276.2999999999997
I do seem to impose but it's all

3273.9 --> 3278.339
voluntary I can't I realize underneath

3276.3 --> 3279.8390000000004
all of what I do that I can't actually

3278.339 --> 3282.96
Force anyone

3279.839 --> 3285.48
I can just try to be very urgent about a

3282.96 --> 3289.44
point and that's it

3285.48 --> 3291.78
right but if you then don't do that or

3289.44 --> 3295.2000000000003
you're like I don't know I'm not gonna

3291.78 --> 3298.2000000000003
be like how dare you fall in line peon

3295.2 --> 3298.2
no

3299.579 --> 3304.319
and I'm not gonna like look at you even

3301.68 --> 3306.359
all that different a lot of the time

3304.319 --> 3308.7599999999998
unless you go all game on me but that's

3306.359 --> 3313.2
purely behavioral based

3308.76 --> 3316.1400000000003
right there's nothing to do with what

3313.2 --> 3318.68
ever subject or idea I seem to be

3316.14 --> 3318.68
imposing

3326.099 --> 3330.78
and also

3328.02 --> 3333.78
I have to basically admit that sometimes

3330.78 --> 3337.619
especially when I get agitated I do

3333.78 --> 3339.1800000000003
sometimes ban people for their opinion

3337.619 --> 3341.76
in something

3339.18 --> 3343.7
because it's like really egregious to me

3341.76 --> 3346.5
when I do that

3343.7 --> 3348.839
that's also personal

3346.5 --> 3352.2
and it has to do it has to do basically

3348.839 --> 3356.52
with social dominance in this place when

3352.2 --> 3359.2799999999997
I do that like I have to do that

3356.52 --> 3361.8
can't let people in the chat get away

3359.28 --> 3364.619
with that under any circumstances or I

3361.8 --> 3368.119
basically everybody will just lose

3364.619 --> 3368.119
respect and walk all over me

3368.28 --> 3373.26
right

3369.54 --> 3375.66
but it is not something that

3373.26 --> 3377.579
like it is personal I do it because of

3375.66 --> 3380.3999999999996
the Dynamics of the situation I have to

3377.579 --> 3383.099
get through it in such a moment

3380.4 --> 3385.44
ah

3383.099 --> 3386.4
and sometimes somebody can just go way

3385.44 --> 3388.2000000000003
too far

3386.4 --> 3390.839
and then I ban him and then I don't want

3388.2 --> 3393.1189999999997
him back for a while or maybe ever

3390.839 --> 3395.339
and other times I I really do get it

3393.119 --> 3396.78
like oh he's just really upset about

3395.339 --> 3399.54
something

3396.78 --> 3401.6400000000003
and then I give you like a day or two

3399.54 --> 3403.859
and then

3401.64 --> 3406.0789999999997
usually people have calm down

3403.859 --> 3407.16
right this is so yeah a lot of my

3406.079 --> 3411.3
Banning

3407.16 --> 3414.7799999999997
is really about management and also

3411.3 --> 3418.559
about Authority in this place

3414.78 --> 3419.82
that I must wield or I lose it

3418.559 --> 3422.9590000000003
anyway

3419.82 --> 3422.9590000000003
[Music]

3437.22 --> 3443.04
Craig is where

3440.16 --> 3445.319
flat so it is kind of like doing things

3443.04 --> 3447.619
with Craig isn't he

3445.319 --> 3447.619
foreign

3464.66 --> 3468.0589999999997
that's a pretty accurate description

3466.92 --> 3471.079
there

3468.059 --> 3471.079
he does do that

3476.4 --> 3482.339
I mean he does kind of like use

3479.28 --> 3484.559
everything to just Walsh over people

3482.339 --> 3486.72
completely

3484.559 --> 3488.4
and I think he's kind of I think that

3486.72 --> 3490.14
fight to Flat Earth is kind of jealous

3488.4 --> 3493.6800000000003
of Nathan

3490.14 --> 3497.04
I think he's jealous of how Nathan is

3493.68 --> 3499.7999999999997
being so successful with his method

3497.04 --> 3502.319
of well walching over people

3499.8 --> 3506.2200000000003
except that Nathan is very much

3502.319 --> 3508.92
improving how he does that

3506.22 --> 3512.04
right he used to like have times where

3508.92 --> 3514.5
he would just like straight on go right

3512.04 --> 3516.359
over it now he's like no

3514.5 --> 3519.96
first you gotta

3516.359 --> 3523.799
they got it like actually

3519.96 --> 3527.52
ignite the fuse before he does that now

3523.799 --> 3529.98
they gotta misbehave and then he slowly

3527.52 --> 3531.839
starts to watch and then eventually just

3529.98 --> 3534.359
right

3531.839 --> 3537.72
so and I think fight to Flat Earth is

3534.359 --> 3540.66
just jealous of Nathan's well domination

3537.72 --> 3543.1189999999997
power in a conversation

3540.66 --> 3546.18
he doesn't realize that Nathan is very

3543.119 --> 3549.599
rigidly Guided by principles

3546.18 --> 3552.54
because Craig is a well a globe

3549.599 --> 3554.339
fantasist so yeah

3552.54 --> 3558.54
it's all fluid to him he doesn't

3554.339 --> 3559.92
understand that that power is there for

3558.54 --> 3562.5
a reason

3559.92 --> 3565.619
to basically through action and

3562.5 --> 3568.2
communication bind the principles that

3565.619 --> 3570.299
Nathan upholds like Craig doesn't even

3568.2 --> 3571.799
understand that

3570.299 --> 3574.92
okay

3571.799 --> 3577.5
he doesn't get that but he is jealous of

3574.92 --> 3579.299
what Nathan does and he seems to be

3577.5 --> 3581.18
trying to do something similar but he

3579.299 --> 3583.859
has is just

3581.18 --> 3588.0589999999997
wrecking things

3583.859 --> 3591.68
no consistency no principles just he

3588.059 --> 3591.6800000000003
just wants to crush people

3593.4 --> 3596.42
very gamma

3604.079 --> 3608.46
right

3605.22 --> 3611.18
what do you guys think my analysis

3608.46 --> 3611.18
correct

3621.68 --> 3624.81
[Music]

3625.579 --> 3628.88
it's okay

3631.079 --> 3637.38

[Music]

3637.38 --> 3640.38
right

3658.2 --> 3661.2
foreign

3662.299 --> 3666.54
but I do think it's interesting that

3664.44 --> 3669.54
flat side is basically

3666.54 --> 3671.7
still willing to just

3669.54 --> 3673.619
do these things with anti-flat earthers

3671.7 --> 3675.96
like I don't even have the patience for

3673.619 --> 3679.98
that anymore

3675.96 --> 3682.2
I have maybe it's just the rage win

3679.98 --> 3684.319
because I'm just like immediately just

3682.2 --> 3687.66
ready to strap

3684.319 --> 3689.7
it's just it's the the mannerisms the

3687.66 --> 3690.96
little details and how they do it and

3689.7 --> 3693.0789999999997
how they like

3690.96 --> 3695.819
make their

3693.079 --> 3699.7200000000003
weaponized social behavior they even try

3695.819 --> 3702.54
to like make it aesthetic in that it's

3699.72 --> 3704.5789999999997
so [ __ ] up man anti-flat Earth or some

3702.54 --> 3707.7799999999997
of them are so [ __ ] up

3704.579 --> 3707.78
it's unbelievable

3708.299 --> 3713.16
and I can't handle that I can't handle

3710.819 --> 3716.819
what they do it just makes me want to

3713.16 --> 3719.819
Lunge for their throat immediately

3716.819 --> 3722.22
because maybe fun

3719.819 --> 3725.04
yes

3722.22 --> 3727.68
no I don't think it would be

3725.04 --> 3729.48
I would get very pissed off at him very

3727.68 --> 3731.5789999999997
quickly it would turn into passive

3729.48 --> 3733.98
aggression and then he would play into

3731.579 --> 3736.1400000000003
it and start nagging me and whining me

3733.98 --> 3739.619
pushing me and try to talk to me from

3736.14 --> 3742.2
the heights as he likes to do

3739.619 --> 3744.0
and I would probably kind of like trick

3742.2 --> 3747.9199999999996
him and [ __ ] but it wouldn't be worth it

3744.0 --> 3747.92
I'd still feel miserable afterward

3749.64 --> 3755.18
yeah

3751.559 --> 3755.1800000000003
exactly PGC net

3769.94 --> 3773.78

hmm

3821.52 --> 3824.119
foreign

3825.26 --> 3831.8390000000004
but I mean seriously guys the empty

3828.599 --> 3834.059
flight earthers they have so much spine

3831.839 --> 3835.98
against me now also because I well I

3834.059 --> 3839.7000000000003
didn't show them right I did show them

3835.98 --> 3844.319
what I have inside just that I

3839.7 --> 3848.0989999999997
don't utilize that in my common ways

3844.319 --> 3850.079
right but if for example just imagine I

3848.099 --> 3852.42
would be on Jim Bob's and then Brenda

3850.079 --> 3855.319
would just dive in you know she's gonna

3852.42 --> 3858.92
immediately start to bully me

3855.319 --> 3858.92
immediately it's

3859.26 --> 3862.44
right

3860.64 --> 3864.0589999999997
that yeah

3862.44 --> 3866.339
and they're all kind of like that

3864.059 --> 3868.079
because they know like I'm extremely

3866.339 --> 3870.599
intolerant of that

3868.079 --> 3873.059
so there's not a lot that I can do to

3870.599 --> 3876.0
kind of stop letting that piss me off I

3873.059 --> 3878.7000000000003
can just try to ignore it or go away

3876.0 --> 3882.059
that's it so they feel they have an

3878.7 --> 3883.74
advantage over me by my sensitivity and

3882.059 --> 3888.26
they exploit that

3883.74 --> 3888.2599999999998

3902.28 --> 3906.799
don't say that in chat

that then don't don't blabber off about

3912.359 --> 3914.66
it

3916.26 --> 3920.5400000000004

interesting times

3954.359 --> 3958.74
fiber oats I agree

3956.46 --> 3960.9
I mean oh Benjamin going through the

3958.74 --> 3963.0589999999997
Awakening as he was like basically still

3960.9 --> 3966.059
live performing was

3963.059 --> 3968.52
fascinating because he did actually like

3966.059 --> 3971.76
awake from it

3968.52 --> 3973.98
right there inside pretty amazing

3971.76 --> 3978.26
I remember because I was there a lot of

3973.98 --> 3978.26
it it was in the D life days

3984.799 --> 3989.78
he seems really he is really intelligent

3995.88 --> 3998.88
foreign

4008.619 --> 4013.6600000000003
with a big head and a big mind

4038.48 --> 4046.42
this is my YouTube now well there's

4041.96 --> 4051.02
still like he tries to sneak in

4046.42 --> 4051.02
proxy accounts right

4051.2 --> 4057.2599999999998
so there is still some live streaming on

4054.26 --> 4058.88
YouTube sometimes or uploads I don't

4057.26 --> 4060.44
think live streams

4058.88 --> 4062.599
he does that through all the other

4060.44 --> 4065.7200000000003
things that he does

4062.599 --> 4070.42
I just watch it after the fact on bit

4065.72 --> 4070.4199999999996
shoot and that's been very stable so

4071.48 --> 4075.46
that's how I watch own Benjamin

4092.319 --> 4097.42
when

4094.22 --> 4097.42

4125.98 --> 4130.839

oh hello by the way Tony see you

4449.02 --> 4453.9400000000005
combustion in a vacuum because that's a

4451.76 --> 4453.9400000000005
problem

4454.76 --> 4460.88
yep yeah rockets in a vacuum right I I

4458.42 --> 4463.82
talked about that recently it's one of

4460.88 --> 4465.7390000000005
the things that for me even like in 2015

4463.82 --> 4467.84
was one of the first things that my mind

4465.739 --> 4470.54
really latched on

4467.84 --> 4473.179
from still kind of within this

4470.54 --> 4476.36
within figuring it out it's like wait

4473.179 --> 4478.4
Rockets propulsion how can that work in

4476.36 --> 4480.62
a vacuum it's it's not gonna push

4478.4 --> 4483.0199999999995
against anything it's just gonna poof Go

4480.62 --> 4485.599999999999
in all directions how is it

4483.02 --> 4489.38
causing Force

4485.6 --> 4491.3
to displace the thing the rocket if it's

4489.38 --> 4493.88
not actually pushing against anything

4491.3 --> 4496.06
the gas is just [ __ ] off in all

4493.88 --> 4496.06
directions

4496.1 --> 4498.76
right

4499.82 --> 4504.5599999999995
and that was like one of the earlier

4502.1 --> 4507.88
speaking points on my channel like even

4504.56 --> 4507.88
in the flatter talks days

4510.04 --> 4515.0
Rockets don't oh God here come the

4512.78 --> 4518.719
numpties

4515.0 --> 4521.48
yeah no Rockets definitely do push

4518.719 --> 4524.08
that's the point that's the idea of

4521.48 --> 4524.08
propulsion

4524.1 --> 4528.38
[Music]

4526.4 --> 4532.82
put something out there and then it

4528.38 --> 4535.58
pushes you it propels you

4532.82 --> 4538.46
pushes right just like a propeller like

4535.58 --> 4541.28
it pushes against the air

4538.46 --> 4543.679
at the back of it and that's how it then

4541.28 --> 4547.58
moves the airplane with propellers

4543.679 --> 4549.679
forward well that's with all the effects

4547.58 --> 4551.9
whether you use some kind of combustion

4549.679 --> 4554.54
to create gas and then make that push

4551.9 --> 4556.879999999999
against the air behind it or some

4554.54 --> 4557.96
mechanism that pulls it in like a jet

4556.88 --> 4559.46
engine

4557.96 --> 4561.38
magnetically

4559.46 --> 4563.8
doesn't really matter it's all about the

4561.38 --> 4567.62
push that's the thing that makes

4563.8 --> 4569.6
machines flying machines go forward to

4567.62 --> 4573.159
push against the air

4569.6 --> 4573.159000000001
that includes Rockets

4581.06 --> 4585.860000000001
get engines don't push I will be

4583.699 --> 4589.82
effectively pushed I mean they pull it

4585.86 --> 4592.78
in and then they push it out so

4589.82 --> 4592.78
yeah what's this

4593.78 --> 4600.98
yeah exactly how to make it

4596.96 --> 4603.58
what what's going on here

4600.98 --> 4603.58
foreign

4611.239 --> 4616.159
way at the start what's going on here a

4614.719 --> 4618.58
man like me why are you timing up

4616.159 --> 4618.58
generally

4637.52 --> 4642.219

4647.54 --> 4652.82
I'll show you

4649.88 --> 4655.4800000000005
you damn well did is this

4652.82 --> 4655.48
uh

4656.12 --> 4661.78
right okay this is messy just look all

4659.0 --> 4661.78
the way over the right

4662.54 --> 4668.96
that's probably gonna Echo

4665.659 --> 4671.32
see gently timed out by a man like me

4668.96 --> 4671.32
and

4683.84 --> 4688.2390000000005
about which a man like me with a wrench

4686.3 --> 4691.6
was it then

4688.239 --> 4691.599999999999
what's going on

4696.08 --> 4699.88
something weird's going on here

4702.64 --> 4706.799
[Music]

4709.88 --> 4714.329
[Music]

4722.719 --> 4729.86
you tied them out yesterday internet lag

4727.159 --> 4730.759999999999
that is hysterical Godzilla thank you

4729.86 --> 4734.0199999999995
for that

4730.76 --> 4734.02
that is hysterical

4767.179 --> 4770.179
foreign

4782.92 --> 4788.719
rocket push out gas yeah I know

4787.219 --> 4790.699
but

4788.719 --> 4793.82
yeah pushing out gas is not gonna

4790.699 --> 4795.98
displace it unless the gas that is being

4793.82 --> 4798.139999999999
pushed out by the rocket is actually

4795.98 --> 4801.98
able to push

4798.14 --> 4803.84
against other gas which would be there

4801.98 --> 4806.678999999999
and stable because there's a container

4803.84 --> 4806.679
surrounding it all

4815.06 --> 4820.580000000001
push out gas against the rocket yeah but

4818.06 --> 4824.14
pushing against itself doesn't make

4820.58 --> 4824.14
things displace you see

4825.8 --> 4834.1990000000005
right so if you have an object and that

4830.42 --> 4836.42
object is then pushing against itself

4834.199 --> 4838.82
this is not going to move it

4836.42 --> 4841.1
you can test this yourself if an object

4838.82 --> 4842.48
pushes against itself it's not going to

4841.1 --> 4845.860000000001
displace

4842.48 --> 4845.86
at a consistent rate

4847.04 --> 4852.679
it has to actually push against the

4849.56 --> 4855.080000000001
surrounding to this place

4852.679 --> 4859.04
right just like a car

4855.08 --> 4860.179
the wheels push against the ground or

4859.04 --> 4863.86
asphalt

4860.179 --> 4863.86
to make it displace

4865.4 --> 4872.12
and helicopter wings or

4869.54 --> 4875.179
do you know what I mean they push

4872.12 --> 4878.42
against the air at a certain angle

4875.179 --> 4880.82
to lift it

4878.42 --> 4882.9800000000005
every time it's always pushing against

4880.82 --> 4885.799999999999
the surroundings things cannot push

4882.98 --> 4889.718999999999
against themselves and then be expected

4885.8 --> 4889.719
to displace doesn't work that way

4891.8 --> 4896.179
I have no idea what this Newton's law

4893.659 --> 4897.32
has to do with that but this is just

4896.179 --> 4899.679
practical

4897.32 --> 4902.78
right things might attain momentum

4899.679 --> 4905.3
supposedly within a vacuum

4902.78 --> 4908.0599999999995
but

4905.3 --> 4910.04
there's not gonna be any change in the

4908.06 --> 4916.1
velocity

4910.04 --> 4919.06
without pushing against its surrounding

4916.1 --> 4919.06
that's a fact

4922.4 --> 4926.239
probably not gonna look up anything

4924.5 --> 4928.1
I know what I'm talking about I don't

4926.239 --> 4930.5199999999995
need to look up anything to know that

4928.1 --> 4930.52
I'm right

4940.159 --> 4947.42
you understand things only displace if

4943.76 --> 4950.179
they push against their surrounding

4947.42 --> 4951.92
or pull on their surround doesn't really

4950.179 --> 4954.86
matter push or pull

4951.92 --> 4958.159
without it there is no displacement

4954.86 --> 4961.099999999999
or there's no change in displacement I

4958.159 --> 4962.96
mean things might Glide

4961.1 --> 4965.42
whatever

4962.96 --> 4969.679
there's not going to be a change in

4965.42 --> 4973.2390000000005
velocity unless there is being something

4969.679 --> 4973.2390000000005
is pushing or pulling

4977.36 --> 4981.98
propellers don't generate a gas itself

4979.88 --> 4986.32
yeah but they don't need to they just

4981.98 --> 4986.32
create local air pressure differential

4986.54 --> 4992.84
basically pull in the gas and push it

4990.08 --> 4995.8
harder against the gas

4992.84 --> 4995.8
behind

4995.84 --> 4999.860000000001
and then that air pressure differential

4998.0 --> 5002.92
that's artificially created through the

4999.86 --> 5004.599999999999
constant pressure the propeller is going

5002.92 --> 5008.14
to create this

5004.6 --> 5011.88
higher air pressure pocket and that is

5008.14 --> 5011.88
going to make the whole thing move

5015.76 --> 5021.54
and that's all in gas pressure by the

5019.42 --> 5021.54
way

5029.62 --> 5033.159
all right anyway I'm gonna take a two

5031.6 --> 5035.34
minute break again and I'll be right

5033.159 --> 5035.339999999999
back

5061.9 --> 5064.32
happy

5094.659 --> 5097.659
foreign

5132.699 --> 5135.36
foreign

5162.04 --> 5167.98
those supposed experiments proving that

5165.1 --> 5170.8
it displaces in a vacuum is in a very

5167.98 --> 5173.5
small vacuum chamber

5170.8 --> 5175.6
right so they're tricking you because

5173.5 --> 5177.639
what they're doing is just creating a

5175.6 --> 5180.820000000001
vacuum pump

5177.639 --> 5183.219
that is not strong enough to keep up

5180.82 --> 5184.84
with the increasing combustion gas

5183.219 --> 5187.719
pressure that is created with that

5184.84 --> 5190.06
rocket right the smaller the vacuum

5187.719 --> 5192.639
chamber the easily it will be filled up

5190.06 --> 5194.4400000000005
you can temporarily

5192.639 --> 5196.36
and that's how it can then still

5194.44 --> 5199.419999999999
displace because it's literally just

5196.36 --> 5202.08
pressurizing the environment in order to

5199.42 --> 5202.08
then displace

5202.42 --> 5207.88
so yeah put that thing in a bigger

5205.239 --> 5208.659
vacuum chamber it's not gonna do that at

5207.88 --> 5211.56
all

5208.659 --> 5211.5599999999995
it's that simple

5218.739 --> 5222.12
that's right Godzilla

5232.0 --> 5235.38
I'm just going to do this

5237.699 --> 5240.699
foreign

5241.61 --> 5247.659
[Music]

5243.239 --> 5250.659
's not over here just look

5247.659 --> 5253.839999999999
I mean they do it sometimes but

5250.659 --> 5257.159
like two days ago I noticed it but today

5253.84 --> 5257.159000000001
it's beautiful

5266.139 --> 5269.219
no Trails here

5272.98 --> 5276.41
foreign

5273.23 --> 5276.41
[Music]

5278.86 --> 5281.91
[Music]

5286.239 --> 5288.9
do that

5290.98 --> 5295.379999999999
wow can't believe the camera didn't even

5292.9 --> 5295.379999999999
freeze

5296.14 --> 5299.27
[Music]

5302.38 --> 5307.2390000000005
does anybody know what's in that stuff

5305.62 --> 5310.26
no

5307.239 --> 5314.138999999999
there's been

5310.26 --> 5317.679
suspicions like barium oxide barium

5314.139 --> 5317.679
salts aluminum

5317.86 --> 5323.08
fine dust uh

5321.1 --> 5325.320000000001
but I don't even know if they still use

5323.08 --> 5325.32
that

5328.36 --> 5333.719
I don't think they're using that over

5330.04 --> 5333.719
here in the Netherlands

5342.28 --> 5349.239
Crush off the mess of their exhaust yeah

5344.56 --> 5351.46
but they can't if that exhaust is just

5349.239 --> 5356.0199999999995
basically blasting off in all directions

5351.46 --> 5357.639
it is not until it stabilizes

5356.02 --> 5362.080000000001
right

5357.639 --> 5364.6
the gas when it escapes it first has to

5362.08 --> 5365.8
kind of find an equilibrium with its

5364.6 --> 5369.34
surrounding

5365.8 --> 5372.159000000001
even if just temporarily and then

5369.34 --> 5374.4400000000005
then suddenly there is a gas pressure

5372.159 --> 5377.259999999999
that can be pushed off

5374.44 --> 5379.9
that's how it works

5377.26 --> 5383.08
but if there's just infinite vacuum

5379.9 --> 5384.699
around you there is no point where that

5383.08 --> 5387.4
gas is going to have some kind of

5384.699 --> 5389.678999999999
equilibrium with its surrounding enough

5387.4 --> 5392.86
for that rocket to then start pushing

5389.679 --> 5396.219
off that that doesn't actually work

5392.86 --> 5400.0599999999995
there needs to be some measure of

5396.219 --> 5402.159
equilibrium with the surrounding

5400.06 --> 5404.92
of the gas coming out of there

5402.159 --> 5407.62
before it can start to push that's just

5404.92 --> 5410.02
how it works

5407.62 --> 5412.0
you can fantasize all day long about how

5410.02 --> 5414.719
it's pushing off itself but this just

5412.0 --> 5414.719
doesn't work

5420.97 --> 5426.219
[Music]

5422.56 --> 5427.54
yeah space Rockets is science fiction it

5426.219 --> 5431.44
always was science fiction

5427.54 --> 5434.8
[Music]

5431.44 --> 5437.28
Rockets only work in a pressurized

5434.8 --> 5437.28
environment

5447.94 --> 5452.58
what are you talking about firing a

5450.159 --> 5452.58
crossbow

5456.58 --> 5462.76
that's literally splitting apart

5459.88 --> 5466.2390000000005
right I mean if there's two physical

5462.76 --> 5468.88
objects that are like separate

5466.239 --> 5470.739
masses separate weight

5468.88 --> 5472.900000000001
they're gonna push off each other yeah

5470.739 --> 5475.12
they're just gonna go apart depending on

5472.9 --> 5477.759999999999
the balance between

5475.12 --> 5480.94
the splitting up that's it yeah that

5477.76 --> 5483.52
does happen yeah gas

5480.94 --> 5487.678999999999
exploding and thrusting out isn't

5483.52 --> 5487.679
however not gonna push off anything

5487.78 --> 5493.36
it's not the same principle because

5490.3 --> 5494.38
that's literally a big chunk of the

5493.36 --> 5497.739
weight

5494.38 --> 5500.02
being separated in one mechanical goal

5497.739 --> 5502.5599999999995
it's very different

5500.02 --> 5502.56
okay

5504.1 --> 5511.06
combustion gas expansion

5507.76 --> 5513.42
is not going to be like that it's not

5511.06 --> 5516.219
the mass

5513.42 --> 5518.679
pushing a god off each other that that

5516.219 --> 5522.88
would happen if you literally threw out

5518.679 --> 5525.54
all the all the rocket fuel like in one

5522.88 --> 5528.76
giant burst right if you did that like

5525.54 --> 5531.639
boom yeah then because then you

5528.76 --> 5533.9800000000005
literally take a significant piece of

5531.639 --> 5537.1
the weight of the entire thing that in

5533.98 --> 5539.08
one go just blasts right it's literally

5537.1 --> 5541.780000000001
Mass

5539.08 --> 5545.219
separating then it could displace but if

5541.78 --> 5545.219
there's like a steady rocket

5545.32 --> 5550.179
it's not gonna be enough

5547.48 --> 5553.339999999999
it's just gonna be like a crossbow

5550.179 --> 5554.7390000000005
that's super weak that's just gonna like

5553.34 --> 5557.56
[Music]

5554.739 --> 5560.5599999999995
right it's not gonna then it's just

5557.56 --> 5564.2390000000005
gonna move and that's it you won't

5560.56 --> 5564.2390000000005
displace anything else right

5564.82 --> 5570.099999999999
unless you explode the entire Rocket

5567.639 --> 5573.28
Fuel content in like a second like one

5570.1 --> 5576.639
go boom that which would result in

5573.28 --> 5579.34
literally the mass of this uh subject of

5576.639 --> 5581.9800000000005
the object literally being split up

5579.34 --> 5584.5
that might cause one little nudge of

5581.98 --> 5586.599999999999
displacement

5584.5 --> 5590.26
but

5586.6 --> 5593.1990000000005
just the combustion

5590.26 --> 5596.76
pushing against nothing at a gradual

5593.199 --> 5596.759999999999
rate is not going to have that effect

5597.28 --> 5602.219
just doesn't work

5599.02 --> 5602.219
can't be made to work

5605.8 --> 5609.9400000000005
right it's not recall exactly that

5607.84 --> 5611.32
that's The Recoil that's the one I'm

5609.94 --> 5613.0599999999995
yeah

5611.32 --> 5614.679
I'm just describing I don't even

5613.06 --> 5616.780000000001
sometimes I don't even know the

5614.679 --> 5619.06
mechanical words I'll just describe it

5616.78 --> 5622.259999999999
what I'm talking about but yeah that's

5619.06 --> 5622.26
called recoil indeed

5626.62 --> 5629.83
[Music]

5631.42 --> 5636.46
all right but indeed as Adam again says

5634.6 --> 5639.2390000000005
rocket thrust is not the same Principle

5636.46 --> 5639.2390000000005
as recoil

5644.199 --> 5648.719
wrote recoil in your post okay

5656.98 --> 5661.259999999999
well I answered your question didn't I

5661.54 --> 5666.88
didn't I answer your question Igor

5664.48 --> 5668.44
didn't I address like how that would be

5666.88 --> 5671.1990000000005
different what would happen how the

5668.44 --> 5673.719
entire masses would split up oh no I did

5671.199 --> 5675.339999999999
not oh I did not just spend five minutes

5673.719 --> 5679.4800000000005
explaining it

5675.34 --> 5682.32
in extreme detail did I

5679.48 --> 5682.32
okay

5686.139 --> 5690.639
I guess you must have taken a break or

5688.9 --> 5693.48
something while I was saying that then

5690.639 --> 5693.4800000000005
goodie

5693.76 --> 5696.85
[Music]

5711.9 --> 5715.659
[Music]

5713.32 --> 5717.94
do you know the speed and the mass of

5715.659 --> 5721.96
the fuel being injected

5717.94 --> 5724.839999999999
well all I need to know in this case is

5721.96 --> 5727.36
how much mass

5724.84 --> 5730.900000000001
right what's the percentage of the mass

5727.36 --> 5735.36
of the entire object and how much of it

5730.9 --> 5737.86
is transformed into combustion

5735.36 --> 5740.32
percentile-wise over time I'd like to

5737.86 --> 5743.38
hear a formula about that

5740.32 --> 5745.9
right again if it all explodes in a very

5743.38 --> 5748.78
rapid fashion in one go one burst yeah

5745.9 --> 5751.78
then there will be a little Mass

5748.78 --> 5753.58
displacement because a percentage a

5751.78 --> 5757.78
significant percentage of the complete

5753.58 --> 5762.1
weight of the object is suddenly moving

5757.78 --> 5764.739
right so unless that happens it's not

5762.1 --> 5767.58
going to do anything in a vacuum

5764.739 --> 5767.58
so again

5767.98 --> 5773.638999999999
you just keep repeating the same [ __ ]

5770.38 --> 5773.639
over and over again man

make it spin

on something in a vacuum

5857.62 --> 5862.12
it can definitely start spinning out of

6174.36 --> 6177.42
it

6175.38 --> 6179.58
that was the question

6177.42 --> 6182.42

the last 10 minutes

6185.219 --> 6189.2390000000005
yeah

6186.719 --> 6192.179
because this idea

6189.239 --> 6194.599999999999
that that's means that you're ejecting

6192.179 --> 6197.4

6201.06 --> 6205.080000000001
literally just launching it like an with

6203.219 --> 6208.86
an explosion that's more like ballistics

6205.08 --> 6211.86
that's like firing a cannon yeah that's

6208.86 --> 6215.159
how it cannon works boom one big

6211.86 --> 6219.0599999999995
explosion massive momentum

6215.159 --> 6222.0
yeah rocket propulsion never works like

6219.06 --> 6225.2390000000005
that and thus in a vacuum

6222.0 --> 6228.6
there will be never a percentile high

6225.239 --> 6230.4
enough of the entire mass of the rocket

6228.6 --> 6233.34
thrown out

6230.4 --> 6236.219
in order to displace it

6233.34 --> 6239.52
through recoil it just doesn't do that

6236.219 --> 6241.5
Rockets don't do that

6239.52 --> 6244.820000000001
doesn't matter how freaking insanely

6241.5 --> 6244.82
large they're supposed to be

6263.119 --> 6270.719
yeah a slow explosion goody

6268.08 --> 6273.239
I know it is

6270.719 --> 6276.119
and what makes it actually thrust

6273.239 --> 6278.94
is that that explosion creates an air

6276.119 --> 6281.04
pressure differential because it's

6278.94 --> 6282.119
pushing against all the gas surrounding

6281.04 --> 6285.54
it

6282.119 --> 6287.639
that push against the container wall

6285.54 --> 6289.92
and that local air pressure differential

6287.639 --> 6293.88
is the thing that then

6289.92 --> 6297.06
pushes the rocket further making it

6293.88 --> 6300.619
accelerate that's what's doing that yeah

6297.06 --> 6300.619000000001

6356.58 --> 6362.639
doesn't though because in reality it

6359.34 --> 6364.9800000000005
requires gas pressure equilibrium with a

6362.639 --> 6367.4400000000005
container wall

6364.98 --> 6369.959999999999
in order to build that pressure and then

6367.44 --> 6372.239
cause the rocket to displace

6369.96 --> 6373.7390000000005
that's how it works in reality I know on

6372.239 --> 6375.419999999999
the globe they made up that you could

6373.739 --> 6378.239
just push against nothing and then make

6375.42 --> 6380.1
yourself displace yeah that doesn't

6378.239 --> 6383.0

6387.84 --> 6394.7390000000005

2016 as an alternative creative

6404.219 --> 6409.26
direction for the globe model because it

6407.28 --> 6411.84
makes things more tenable

that the rocket itself was the container

6521.94 --> 6527.28
to push against

6523.5 --> 6530.4
that means it's pushing against itself

6527.28 --> 6533.759999999999

container wall in this setup there's an

outer space vacuum the gas going outside

6536.219 --> 6543.0
is not gonna find an equilibrium to push

6539.52 --> 6546.179
