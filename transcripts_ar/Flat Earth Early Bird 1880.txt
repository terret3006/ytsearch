are working

1094.07 --> 1097.27
[Music]

1098.44 --> 1103.0800000000002
out come to the conclusion that all

1100.84 --> 1106.08
religion is either about love or

1103.08 --> 1106.08
fear

1106.72 --> 1110.76
yeah oh that's what's being

1118.64 --> 1122.2
used hey Ben

1133.08 --> 1141.1999999999998
Johnson right yeah S I mean that is a

1136.4 --> 1141.2
bit challenging would be to me

1144.48 --> 1152.32
too unless you can find some routine to

1147.2 --> 1152.32
like keep you physically occupied in

1153.679 --> 1160.4
between I don't know maybe you could

1155.6 --> 1160.3999999999999
like work out in between or

1167.24 --> 1170.24
something

1186.1 --> 1189.2199999999998
[Music]

1193.72 --> 1196.96
hey did I miss a comment

1197.24 --> 1200.24
there

1204.559 --> 1207.28
oh wait

1213.679 --> 1220.0
yeah my situation was worse because at

1216.48 --> 1222.2
least I got paid she got paid yeah I

1220.0 --> 1222.2
guess

1227.159 --> 1230.159
so

1242.72 --> 1248.52
struggling with the religious aspect of

1245.28 --> 1252.799
if what exactly what religious

1248.52 --> 1252.799
aspect or G could you

1257.12 --> 1260.12
elaborate

1284.49 --> 1288.8700000000001
[Music]

1287.039 --> 1291.98
f

1288.87 --> 1291.9799999999998
[Music]

1301.6 --> 1306.52
what to expl yeah but I mean what

1303.36 --> 1308.52
exactly is the religious aspect that's

1306.52 --> 1310.8799999999999
what I'm wondering I mean if there's a

1308.52 --> 1313.48
religious aspect you're struggling with

1310.88 --> 1313.48
what is it

1317.039 --> 1320.039
exactly

1343.2 --> 1352.76
Tre is that how is that an aspect of Fe

1349.44 --> 1355.3200000000002
I don't get it Richard G isn't that just

1352.76 --> 1355.32
up to the

1357.17 --> 1372.8590000000002
[Music]

1376.96 --> 1379.96
individual

1405.64 --> 1410.279
is it the Bible says flat

1408.38 --> 1413.279
[Music]

1410.279 --> 1413.279
H

1417.159 --> 1424.96
right I mean the Bible is not

1421.919 --> 1427.3200000000002
really like a source for argumentation

1424.96 --> 1429.24
it's just a reference like yeah Flat

1427.32 --> 1432.08
Earth

1429.24 --> 1434.32
is arguably

1432.08 --> 1436.6
Christian as

1434.32 --> 1440.1589999999999
well but I

1436.6 --> 1443.3999999999999
mean that's not really to base an actual

1440.159 --> 1443.4
argument of in my

1448.84 --> 1453.32
opinion bibles are flat

1460.65 --> 1463.679
[Music]

1466.799 --> 1469.799
okay

1491.039 --> 1493.559
oh my

1496.76 --> 1499.76
God

1506.399 --> 1511.559
got some focusing issues I did not sleep

1508.72 --> 1511.559
well this

1526.679 --> 1529.679
night

1539.44 --> 1543.559
par arms Justified according to the

1544.039 --> 1548.24
Bible uh I don't

1554.399 --> 1562.1589999999999
know do you wear the sweater exclusively

1558.52 --> 1562.1589999999999
for the What the

1562.64 --> 1568.76
how do I wear other clothes when I go

1565.44 --> 1568.76
outside yeah I wear a

1583.679 --> 1589.6000000000001
jacket why do you want to know

1586.6 --> 1589.6
duper

1616.6 --> 1619.6
that

1629.399 --> 1635.799
it's just the people of

1631.6 --> 1635.799
course I mean it usually

1646.52 --> 1649.52
is

1670.66 --> 1674.3990000000001
[Music]

1672.6 --> 1676.9189999999999
man I hope I'm really going to wake up

1674.399 --> 1681.84
soon because course it's going to be a

1676.919 --> 1685.72
really boring show just getting

1681.84 --> 1685.72
fatigued I did not sleep

1693.679 --> 1698.8400000000001
well

1695.24 --> 1702.1200000000001

1698.84 --> 1702.12
hey Rick good to see

1706.44 --> 1709.44
you

1725.0 --> 1730.519
right yeah now of course r i mean

1727.88 --> 1733.1200000000001
that's

1730.519 --> 1735.679
yes that's the whole issue with the

1733.12 --> 1737.8799999999999
Bible in the first place is that there's

1735.679 --> 1741.279
a lot of really good tips and

1737.88 --> 1745.0390000000002
interesting things in there that ring

1741.279 --> 1745.039
truth but then to

1745.279 --> 1753.76
like completely use it as an an Arbiter

1749.679 --> 1757.3990000000001
of absolute truth accompanied by the

1753.76 --> 1760.279
typical Priestly ideas about what that

1757.399 --> 1763.1589999999999
all means and what you're supposed to do

1760.279 --> 1766.72
that's the part where it

1763.159 --> 1769.1200000000001
basically yeah becomes the religion and

1766.72 --> 1772.72
isn't really about the Bible anymore

1769.12 --> 1772.7199999999998
that much it's

1774.48 --> 1779.559
just or maybe yeah wording it

1782.64 --> 1786.44
right just the way that people deal with

1785.2 --> 1791.8400000000001
the Bible

1786.44 --> 1791.8400000000001
is is like it feels

1796.32 --> 1799.32
misleading

1810.88 --> 1817.3990000000001
check that flat side oh Ben

1814.159 --> 1820.519
Johnson oh was it that bad

1817.399 --> 1824.7199999999998
okay I don't even check that

1820.519 --> 1824.72
anymore I have no idea what they're up

1826.24 --> 1829.24
to

1854.21 --> 1858.96
[Music]

1856.24 --> 1863.849

1907.44 --> 1910.559
it I just

1916.159 --> 1919.159
don't

1942.559 --> 1949.9189999999999
upset when you say that yeah well but

1945.76 --> 1952.72
because that's just what the yeah what

1949.919 --> 1954.3990000000001
Bible people religious people do they

1952.72 --> 1958.0
like make

1954.399 --> 1960.639
these claims and

1958.0 --> 1962.679
then yeah when you like have doubts

1960.639 --> 1965.799
about that when you question anything

1962.679 --> 1968.2
about their specific Faith they get

1965.799 --> 1972.2
insulted it's just what

1968.2 --> 1972.2

2546.92 --> 2551.16
in this morning it just I just got up

2549.44 --> 2553.839
even though it was really early CU I

2551.16 --> 2556.44

super early or

2615.04 --> 2620.16
that I got

2617.68 --> 2621.359
freaking anxiety stuff again in the

2620.16 --> 2623.8799999999997
middle of the

2621.359 --> 2627.319
night and then there's literally nobody

2623.88 --> 2630.6400000000003
to communicate about it and well I did

2627.319 --> 2634.48
communicate about it this

2630.64 --> 2637.2799999999997
morning so at least like I I'm not like

2634.48 --> 2641.48
ah being haunted or anything right now

2637.28 --> 2641.48
but I'm just like kind of knackered of

2649.0 --> 2653.04
it but hopefully it will

2656.92 --> 2662.48
recover so my apologies for everybody

2659.599 --> 2664.839
watching that I was expecting a complete

2662.48 --> 2669.28
Lively show I'm just not feeling super

2664.839 --> 2669.2799999999997
well but I definitely wanted to be

2671.8 --> 2676.559
here hopefully the chat activity will

2674.359 --> 2680.319
make up for it a bit thank all of you

2716.64 --> 2723.5589999999997
it I can postpone the show later I do

2720.8 --> 2723.559
appreciate the

2724.04 --> 2728.8
gesture but I I don't know let's just

2727.04 --> 2732.44
see the

2728.8 --> 2735.079
next 15 minutes or so and if it just

2732.44 --> 2736.7200000000003
won't go away or it'll get worse then

2735.079 --> 2740.6400000000003
I'll probably round out and then maybe

2736.72 --> 2740.64
do later show in the evening or

2746.44 --> 2751.359
something wailing wind all the time is

2749.16 --> 2755.68
not really helping

2751.359 --> 2759.04
either like when you're rested plentyful

2755.68 --> 2761.64
then you get like nervous from that but

2759.04 --> 2763.8
when I'm not rested it just like adds to

2832.8 --> 2837.319
does my healer help well he helped me

2835.4 --> 2840.92
plenty but I

2837.319 --> 2844.72
mean not with this specific thing

2840.92 --> 2847.4
yet I mean I've been like all over the

2844.72 --> 2849.9599999999996
place

2847.4 --> 2854.0
don't think I've had this many different

2849.96 --> 2856.48
like Vision [ __ ] related anxiety stuff

2854.0 --> 2856.48
it's kind of

2866.2 --> 2872.5989999999997
worrisome right so it's just like I

2868.72 --> 2874.2
don't know I sounds weird guys but don't

2872.599 --> 2877.3590000000004
worry too

2874.2 --> 2879.9199999999996
much but like I have like thought of

2877.359 --> 2882.359
like Jesus if this gets any worse like I

2879.92 --> 2886.64
need to like maybe

2882.359 --> 2890.0
like be committed or something like just

2886.64 --> 2892.1189999999997
that just so that I have like people

2890.0 --> 2897.24
around me all the

2892.119 --> 2899.6400000000003
time and I that I could like just

2897.24 --> 2903.0
go get super

2899.64 --> 2904.16
emotional Etc just just to like try to

2903.0 --> 2907.119
get through

2904.16 --> 2909.64
it it's been heavy man it's been really

2907.119 --> 2909.6400000000003
heavy

2910.559 --> 2917.3190000000004
guys it's like one thing after another

2913.64 --> 2920.0789999999997
it's like oh one thing one paranoid

2917.319 --> 2922.8
thing an idea like oh they're going to

2920.079 --> 2925.1600000000003
get me and then like I resolve it and

2922.8 --> 2927.559
then it's like the next

2925.16 --> 2931.2
thing and then I resolve that and then

2927.559 --> 2933.119
immediately it's like like all of it

2931.2 --> 2935.319
it's almost like I got all like the

2933.119 --> 2936.359
terrifying parts of my vision that are

2935.319 --> 2939.0
all

2936.359 --> 2941.4
just waiting in a row like to unleash

2939.0 --> 2943.96
themselves after I like rounded out the

2941.4 --> 2947.28
previous thing it's pretty

2943.96 --> 2951.559
bizarre like I've never had it like this

2947.28 --> 2954.8390000000004
usually it's like isolated it's like one

2951.559 --> 2957.7200000000003
thing then I figure it out I still get a

2954.839 --> 2961.359
little bit wobbly but I just move on and

2957.72 --> 2963.5989999999997
then grow out of it but now it's like

2961.359 --> 2966.4
every two days is another thing it's

2963.599 --> 2969.0
like bomb all over again

2966.4 --> 2971.599
like real Panic all over it's like I

2969.0 --> 2971.599
never had

2971.64 --> 2974.64
this

2976.92 --> 2983.76
ah but yeah hopefully if my healer finds

2981.04 --> 2985.52
some patience I mean yeah he's been

2983.76 --> 2989.8390000000004
super

2985.52 --> 2992.96
great but hopefully he'll be able to

2989.839 --> 2995.119
like calm it down again and then I don't

2992.96 --> 2998.48
know maybe I just need to get some sleep

2995.119 --> 2998.48
again and and get over

2998.96 --> 3005.2400000000002
it just start start from the

3002.92 --> 3006.92
beginning is what I'm trying to do now

3005.24 --> 3010.3999999999996
but I'm just like too

3006.92 --> 3013.599
sleepy it's not like I'm currently in

3010.4 --> 3015.7200000000003
like a panic or anything at least you

3013.599 --> 3018.52
know if I would have been I would have

3015.72 --> 3018.52
not started the

3023.88 --> 3028.599
show but maybe that's because yeah maybe

3027.0 --> 3031.16
that is what it is it's like I've been a

3028.599 --> 3033.799
bit like panicky and emotional before

3031.16 --> 3036.72
this then I'm like okay now I just got

3033.799 --> 3040.24
to man up right got to man up for the

3036.72 --> 3042.1189999999997
show but as I'm doing that I'm getting

3040.24 --> 3044.24
really tired all of a sudden that I

3042.119 --> 3046.55
didn't really feel that much before that

3044.24 --> 3049.729
point it's

3046.55 --> 3049.7290000000003
[Music]

3054.44 --> 3060.359

indeed drain your energy

3074.88 --> 3080.52
yes thank you Richard thank you guys I

3078.359 --> 3084.359
thank you guys I

3080.52 --> 3086.4
really really appreciate the supportive

3084.359 --> 3089.48
words

3086.4 --> 3093.359
and I will really really do everything

3089.48 --> 3093.359
in my power to like get back to

3097.96 --> 3104.079
normal whatever that normal is I mean I

3101.4 --> 3104.079
feel like I've

3110.48 --> 3117.359
changed like I really just want to

3114.359 --> 3117.359
like

3118.4 --> 3124.88
like figure out this whole healing

3121.88 --> 3124.88
thing

3131.52 --> 3138.52
better right I mean it would be awesome

3135.24 --> 3141.68
I I just just have kind of a vision

3138.52 --> 3143.96
about myself in the future like what is

3141.68 --> 3148.1189999999997
it that I really want to

3143.96 --> 3151.92
do I want like help people out really

3148.119 --> 3155.559
that are in similar positions as I am

3151.92 --> 3158.559
like just also because I can also then

3155.559 --> 3160.88
figure it out with myself better like

3158.559 --> 3163.079
maybe if I could like get to know

3160.88 --> 3167.2000000000003
somebody that's like pretty much in the

3163.079 --> 3170.2400000000002
same package and then see them talk

3167.2 --> 3174.359
about it and express it privately that I

3170.24 --> 3176.0789999999997
could like recognize it from myself

3174.359 --> 3178.68
better

3176.079 --> 3181.52
whenever that happens so that I could

3178.68 --> 3184.52
really get a third person view of the

3181.52 --> 3186.96
effect instead of always being it first

3184.52 --> 3190.4
person then just intellectually having

3186.96 --> 3192.48
to like compartmentalize to deal with it

3190.4 --> 3196.88
which

3192.48 --> 3199.799
works but that then it's

3196.88 --> 3201.1600000000003
harder because like it's harder to tell

3199.799 --> 3205.88
what is real and

3201.16 --> 3207.16
not from that first person perspective

3205.88 --> 3211.6400000000003
I don't

3207.16 --> 3211.64
know just rambling at this point

3215.48 --> 3223.599
maybe right but sharing about it is like

3220.079 --> 3223.599
restoring a bit of energy I'm

3234.16 --> 3237.16
noticing

3239.48 --> 3246.96
maybe take a shower no thanks Lia but no

3243.52 --> 3246.96
like I already took a shower

3248.72 --> 3253.9199999999996
yesterday I thought it helped but then

3251.44 --> 3258.96
in the middle of the like as I was like

3253.92 --> 3258.96
going to bed suddenly like it came back

3264.079 --> 3267.079
again

3294.079 --> 3297.079
yeah

3309.76 --> 3314.6400000000003
all right see you tomorrow slick killer

3312.16 --> 3314.64
good see

3324.0 --> 3327.76
you

3326.24 --> 3330.16
yeah

3327.76 --> 3332.5200000000004
thanks just give it some time and I'll

3330.16 --> 3332.52
be all

3354.0 --> 3357.0
right

3383.92 --> 3386.92
oh

3413.88 --> 3416.88
nah

3443.799 --> 3446.799
I

3473.799 --> 3476.799
for

3503.72 --> 3506.72
is

3506.839 --> 3511.2799999999997
yeah Richard it's very similar to

3513.359 --> 3518.24
that even though time is a concept yeah

3516.039 --> 3518.2400000000002
don't

3518.72 --> 3526.5589999999997
wor but I mean anxiety is a concept too

3522.2 --> 3526.5589999999997
it's so in the

3533.72 --> 3536.72
experience

3562.2 --> 3568.0389999999998
right but the weird thing is like the

3563.839 --> 3570.24
anxiety is all already I'm already like

3568.039 --> 3572.8390000000004
it's not panicking anymore it's just

3570.24 --> 3577.24
that now I'm just feeling tired because

3572.839 --> 3579.96
I can like Let It Go

3577.24 --> 3582.359
Again thank God I'm not like in the

3579.96 --> 3582.359
middle of

3585.96 --> 3591.76
it my life yeah it it does ruin

3593.64 --> 3596.64
everything

3599.88 --> 3606.28
I mean I've to be fair I've been dealing

3602.799 --> 3609.599
with it a fair amount in my

3606.28 --> 3612.8390000000004
life it's just that it does have this

3609.599 --> 3615.92
weird compartmentalizing

3612.839 --> 3618.92
effect it's like like real

3615.92 --> 3622.599
anxiety like it brings its own memories

3618.92 --> 3625.88
with it that are normally like pretty

3622.599 --> 3628.92
much non-existent d they're like not

3625.88 --> 3632.44
relevant to the normal

3628.92 --> 3634.4
State and that stuff like can like kind

3632.44 --> 3636.96
of drive you nuts because then you like

3634.4 --> 3639.1600000000003
remember details of terrible things too

3636.96 --> 3642.48
and all

3639.16 --> 3642.48
that in the

3643.72 --> 3650.24
past and that effectively by that memory

3647.44 --> 3652.48
it sort of has this weird PTSD effect

3650.24 --> 3655.72
where it's like oh you're just

3652.48 --> 3658.92
experiencing it over again

3655.72 --> 3662.5989999999997
like it's right now even though like

3658.92 --> 3662.599
situation is like 20 years

3666.48 --> 3669.48
ago

3671.64 --> 3676.3399999999997
anyway all right so I'm a bit of a

3674.2 --> 3679.499
Debbie Downer today

3676.34 --> 3679.4990000000003
[Music]

3683.44 --> 3686.44
sorry

3696.2 --> 3701.68
like I've detected that there's this

3698.24 --> 3705.0
weird connection with like my Dark World

3701.68 --> 3707.9199999999996
Visions and the anxiety I mean I've

3705.0 --> 3709.16
figured that out a while ago but it is

3707.92 --> 3712.48
like a

3709.16 --> 3715.279
specific part of

3712.48 --> 3719.0
it and then when that that feeling

3715.279 --> 3722.359
returns only that part of the vision

3719.0 --> 3722.359
like comes back to me

3723.16 --> 3729.279
and the only way to like even get a

3726.2 --> 3731.52
grasp on is is to logically analyze that

3729.279 --> 3734.039
experience that I had with in the vision

3731.52 --> 3737.92
to like know that there is a next

3734.039 --> 3740.76
thing there's a next thing that means

3737.92 --> 3746.359
that that the previous thing is

3740.76 --> 3749.1600000000003
basically not happened as was feared

3746.359 --> 3752.0389999999998
and yeah it's really difficult to puzzle

3749.16 --> 3754.8799999999997
it all out

3752.039 --> 3757.079
afterward but I've gotten better at it I

3754.88 --> 3759.839
at least understand like how how it

3757.079 --> 3759.8390000000004
seems to be

3760.88 --> 3765.839
working did I sleep late seem

3766.48 --> 3772.799
tired well I went to bed but I just

3770.079 --> 3772.799
didn't

3773.359 --> 3777.5589999999997
sleep

3775.799 --> 3779.52
I rested a bit but I just couldn't

3777.559 --> 3782.119
really sleep so I kind of like laid

3779.52 --> 3782.119
awake a

3789.08 --> 3792.2599999999998

3863.2 --> 3866.2
for

3881.48 --> 3885.68
right so I really hope you guys don't

3883.16 --> 3890.279
have this issue right now that will be

3885.68 --> 3891.96
great I mean I wouldn't want anybody to

3890.279 --> 3896.16
go through

3891.96 --> 3896.16
this really

3898.72 --> 3903.5589999999997
hope you're all having like more

3901.0 --> 3905.16
comfortable days and maybe even a little

3903.559 --> 3907.799
bit boring or

3905.16 --> 3910.0789999999997
something I mean boring is way better

3907.799 --> 3910.079
than

3910.44 --> 3913.619
[Music]

3923.079 --> 3926.079
this

3935.799 --> 3940.4
did you stop drinking coffee

3938.72 --> 3942.68
again

3940.4 --> 3945.1600000000003
yeah although this funny that you

3942.68 --> 3947.24
mention yesterday I did actually take

3945.16 --> 3950.5989999999997
like half a cup of coffee

3947.24 --> 3953.2
again in the evening and that was just

3950.599 --> 3954.839
fine I didn't have any issues like I

3953.2 --> 3957.0789999999997
didn't have issues like the entire

3954.839 --> 3960.64
evening it was like when I went to bed

3957.079 --> 3960.6400000000003
and then suddenly it struck

3983.0 --> 3987.279
again

3985.279 --> 3990.4
but I mean I hadn't really drank any

3987.279 --> 3994.119
coffee even in the last week at

3990.4 --> 3997.7200000000003
all all this stuff

3994.119 --> 4002.079
happening barely smoked anything like

3997.72 --> 4005.2
but like cannabis was just I didn't

4002.079 --> 4006.2000000000003
smoke like a little bit of hashes here

4005.2 --> 4010.319
and

4006.2 --> 4013.0
there but like very careful with it

4010.319 --> 4015.68
because it just gives overreactions a

4013.0 --> 4018.079
lot

4015.68 --> 4020.96
that only really becomes enjoyable when

4018.079 --> 4020.96
I can actually

4042.92 --> 4045.92
relax

4072.92 --> 4075.92
for

4102.839 --> 4105.839
what

4162.719 --> 4165.719
e

4187.84 --> 4190.959
[Music]

4192.719 --> 4195.719
yeah

4222.64 --> 4226.400000000001
for all

4252.64 --> 4255.64
right

4282.56 --> 4285.56
all

4312.56 --> 4315.56
for

4330.4 --> 4334.159
what was ow Benjamin show about

4340.08 --> 4345.48
yesterday maybe flat could see what

4345.96 --> 4350.88
so if he wants to do that I doubt he is

4348.639 --> 4350.88
going

4352.239 --> 4356.239
to I don't think that's going to

4367.26 --> 4370.4490000000005
[Music]

4372.0 --> 4376.12
help yesterday day was

4383.52 --> 4391.88
like yeah just a lot of like

4387.52 --> 4393.88
uh thinking about the show from the day

4391.88 --> 4395.92
before it's

4393.88 --> 4399.159000000001
like

4395.92 --> 4402.719
about Jake old

4399.159 --> 4405.08
Jake and also about like how Muslims

4402.719 --> 4406.84
regard

4405.08 --> 4410.32
suicide and all that and how that's

4406.84 --> 4413.679
Haram and like how there's like this

4410.32 --> 4416.599999999999
weird group of people that are

4413.679 --> 4420.679
supposedly Muslims that kind of then

4416.6 --> 4425.0
well basically say yeah they say yeah do

4420.679 --> 4429.12
that and they basically like do a

4425.0 --> 4431.36
trickery about the Quran for that and BB

4429.12 --> 4435.239
is pointing that out that was pretty

4431.36 --> 4441.4
good that was a very interesting

4435.239 --> 4441.4
Insight so yeah very insightful show

4448.679 --> 4456.36
yesterday could go to a channel activity

4452.32 --> 4456.36
and see yeah you can definitely do

4462.28 --> 4465.28
that

4465.6 --> 4468.56
cool feature I

4470.56 --> 4476.679
know but just for the ability to just be

4473.44 --> 4478.678999999999
able to check like when the account was

4476.679 --> 4481.32
made is very

4478.679 --> 4485.08
useful they immediately see if it's if

4481.32 --> 4485.08
it's just a sock troll or

4492.28 --> 4495.28
not

4506.53 --> 4509.679999999999
[Music]

4517.36 --> 4521.32
[Music]

4522.84 --> 4527.679
right but but I mean one message I do

4525.28 --> 4530.759999999999
want to give out of all of this is that

4527.679 --> 4533.96
the only real thing that gets you

4530.76 --> 4538.96
through this kind of paranoia

4533.96 --> 4542.6
is or anxiety is just trust in

4538.96 --> 4545.159
God that like no matter what happens

4542.6 --> 4545.159000000001
it's all

4547.71 --> 4552.44
[Music]

4549.8 --> 4554.1990000000005
good and that's really the thing at this

4552.44 --> 4558.12
point that I want to go

4554.199 --> 4563.28
with right and everybody should

4558.12 --> 4563.28
like CU if you don't you can always

4563.52 --> 4569.040000000001
like like this the fear will in your

4566.84 --> 4570.159000000001
mind just create more scenarios of how

4569.04 --> 4572.44
it could go

4570.159 --> 4575.638999999999
wrong right at some point you just got

4572.44 --> 4579.5199999999995
to give up you got to give it up and

4575.639 --> 4579.52
move on and just trust

4579.96 --> 4586.4800000000005
God like that even if something work

4583.32 --> 4589.92
happen that it's still okay that's like

4586.48 --> 4589.919999999999
an important part of it it's

4590.92 --> 4595.12
like weird realization

4597.159 --> 4604.4
that the fear of death or

4600.679 --> 4608.76
something mostly that like can't stop

4604.4 --> 4608.759999999999
you from living because

4609.44 --> 4617.12
then you live the death and you don't

4613.36 --> 4621.719
live the life right it's like living

4617.12 --> 4621.719
death without dying is perhaps even

4637.44 --> 4644.719
worse text on Islam and Muslims would

4640.0 --> 4648.0
cause friction with Fe I recall

4644.719 --> 4648.0
yeah that

4650.28 --> 4655.599999999999
contributed cuz I don't know there's a

4652.48 --> 4659.5599999999995
lot of like Christians that

4655.6 --> 4662.639
are especially in America that are like

4659.56 --> 4666.8
really they've been propagandized to be

4662.639 --> 4669.8
super anti-muslim and basically blame

4666.8 --> 4673.88
every immigrant that's deranged and

4669.8 --> 4675.6
doing criminal stuff or even organized

4673.88 --> 4678.8
and just call that

4675.6 --> 4682.679
Muslim when they are not Muslim because

4678.8 --> 4687.84
that's not what Muslims are allowed to

4682.679 --> 4691.1990000000005
do right and yeah that did start a whole

4687.84 --> 4691.1990000000005
hassle it

4699.71 --> 4704.92
[Music]

4701.92 --> 4704.92
did

4727.28 --> 4733.639
maybe I could be your guest on own yeah

4729.96 --> 4736.199
that's been asked before I I

4733.639 --> 4737.1990000000005
I mean I'd be open to it but I kind of

4736.199 --> 4740.638999999999
doubt

4737.199 --> 4743.0599999999995
it kind of doubt that will happen would

4740.639 --> 4748.249
be really cool

4743.06 --> 4748.249000000001
[Music]

4749.199 --> 4756.08
though that I got to be in a better

4751.52 --> 4756.080000000001
condition at least for any of

4759.12 --> 4764.08
that yes I realize that duper that's how

4762.159 --> 4767.239
that works

4764.08 --> 4767.239
[Music]

4770.32 --> 4777.599999999999

4773.6 --> 4781.400000000001
ow Benjamin super chats with my name in

4777.6 --> 4786.2390000000005
