122.079 --> 125.759
just

124.0 --> 130.56
like

125.759 --> 133.039
one and a half week more to go roughly

130.56 --> 133.03900000000002
anyway

133.76 --> 136.07999999999998
uh

138.48 --> 144.48
sorry for starting a little late i'm uh

142.16 --> 148.0
little overheated here

144.48 --> 148.0
a little rather a lot

148.319 --> 154.72
it is

150.16 --> 154.72
the same kind of beautiful blue skies

155.04 --> 160.48
there's almost no wind

158.48 --> 161.76
i'm literally sitting here right now

160.48 --> 166.16
feeling like i'm already getting

161.76 --> 168.16
overheated so i probably be walking out

166.16 --> 170.959
a lot

168.16 --> 172.959
and i'm really desperate to see this sun

170.959 --> 176.879
like not hitting my wall anymore because

172.959 --> 179.04
it is like almost undoable

176.879 --> 181.84
all ready to check the temperature it is

179.04 --> 184.64
31 degrees celsius but just with that

181.84 --> 186.56
lack of wind it is just not

184.64 --> 189.2
not pleasant here

186.56 --> 191.599
right in front of my computer

189.2 --> 195.64
my monitor also radiates heat and all

191.599 --> 195.64
that and it's just like

201.68 --> 206.4
and yeah

203.84 --> 208.56
i got a little sickish

206.4 --> 212.64000000000001
just yeah i don't know what the hell

208.56 --> 215.44
what that was i went out for groceries

212.64 --> 217.76
then i came back

215.44 --> 220.319
it's really thirsty not surprising and

217.76 --> 222.48
then i drove drank like a whole bunch of

220.319 --> 224.56
super cold apple juice but that seemed

222.48 --> 225.599
to have like been a mistake because like

224.56 --> 229.04
that

225.599 --> 231.51899999999998
hit my stomach really hard

229.04 --> 233.35999999999999
and had to like recover for

231.519 --> 235.36
15 minutes

233.36 --> 237.28
just lying on the couch downstairs where

235.36 --> 239.04000000000002
it's a little cooler than here because

237.28 --> 241.84
it's no

239.04 --> 241.84
not doable here

245.28 --> 249.12
anyway hello gadget inspector first in

247.519 --> 251.04

pj cnet

251.04 --> 257.519
elise g good to see you

253.68 --> 257.519
take a cold shower yeah well

258.16 --> 263.199
that sounds really nice

261.359 --> 265.68
maybe a bit of a foot bath would

263.199 --> 271.72
actually help

265.68 --> 271.72
it is it is that hot i'll try that out

327.199 --> 329.84000000000003
foot bath

331.52 --> 334.52
ah

347.69 --> 350.75
[Music]

359.27 --> 362.45
[Music]

371.99 --> 375.1
[Music]

381.44 --> 385.6
after i thinking

383.919 --> 389.0
fata morgana

385.6 --> 389.0
that's interesting

402.319 --> 408.40000000000003
all right

403.52 --> 412.44
yeah i don't really check his channel so

408.4 --> 412.44
but that does sound interesting

417.1 --> 420.269
[Music]

447.199 --> 452.319
right yes so

448.84 --> 455.599
far nobody that i know that has had like

452.319 --> 457.75
a p900 has actually like caught really

455.599 --> 460.319
caught a fatter morgana like that

457.75 --> 462.8
[Music]

460.319 --> 465.84000000000003
i mean plenty of like road mirages and

462.8 --> 465.84000000000003
all that right

466.16 --> 470.319
but like an actual in the distance

468.639 --> 475.56
fatima ghana that's

470.319 --> 475.56
something i haven't come across so far

478.24 --> 482.599
oh my god let's try this

487.83 --> 491.09999999999997
[Music]

492.479 --> 497.06
god that is cold

493.88 --> 497.06
[Music]

497.44 --> 500.4
it does help a bit

502.8 --> 506.96000000000004
right so yeah i'm

504.8 --> 508.479
i predicted i'm not gonna be all that

506.96 --> 510.56
great this show

508.479 --> 512.159
mostly just being flustered and

510.56 --> 514.719
complaining about the heat so sorry

512.159 --> 514.7189999999999
about that

515.44 --> 520.719
how hot is it there it is 31 degrees

517.599 --> 522.88
celsius but aaron armstrong but the real

520.719 --> 524.88
factor that is making it so incredibly

522.88 --> 526.64
hot is that there is no wind today and

524.88 --> 528.88
yeah yesterday

526.64 --> 531.519
great lots of wind

528.88 --> 534.399
was almost just the same temperature but

531.519 --> 536.5600000000001
with that wind it was just great now

534.399 --> 537.92
it's like just still and everything is

536.56 --> 540.399
just

537.92 --> 542.0799999999999
heating up i can literally see heat

540.399 --> 544.16
ripples

542.08 --> 547.8000000000001
coming off the roof and all that it's

544.16 --> 547.8
really hot now

548.08 --> 552.24
ugh

550.399 --> 556.56
hey steamy traveler

552.24 --> 556.5600000000001
30 degrees celsius jam

557.6 --> 561.24
oh [ __ ]

564.72 --> 569.519
oh man even with the foot bath it's not

567.2 --> 569.519
really

571.12 --> 581.72
really doing it

574.64 --> 581.72
[Music]

583.12 --> 588.519
kind of a question is that aaron

584.8 --> 588.519
armstrong god

590.16 --> 594.8
like to put my feet in an ice bag if

592.24 --> 595.92
you're snowbirds look i got an ice pack

594.8 --> 599.4399999999999
here

595.92 --> 599.4399999999999
around my water it's just

603.519 --> 607.2
i think that the only thing that would

605.04 --> 610.24
really help my condition right now if i

607.2 --> 612.32
was just like fully neck down suspended

610.24 --> 616.16
in water

612.32 --> 618.399
cool water or like average temperature

616.16 --> 620.88
that would probably like really make me

618.399 --> 620.88
feel lucky

622.64 --> 626.399
hey elishi

624.16 --> 629.8389999999999
yes owen was talking about sandman

626.399 --> 632.32
indeed twice in a row

629.839 --> 633.6800000000001
after i brought it

632.32 --> 636.9590000000001
remember yesterday i had a bit of a

633.68 --> 636.959
confused rant about that

637.279 --> 644.48
but yeah there is gravy in it there's

639.44 --> 647.2790000000001
just also a lot of freaking gay in it

644.48 --> 648.9590000000001
and well as owen pointed out i kind of

647.279 --> 650.88
ignored it while i was watching it

648.959 --> 651.68
there's like like

650.88 --> 653.04
the

651.68 --> 654.56
only gay

653.04 --> 657.76
and race

654.56 --> 661.56
mix race mixed relationships

657.76 --> 661.56
in the entire thing

677.92 --> 680.56
oh [ __ ]

682.079 --> 687.3199999999999
fire in the fields damn gadget inspector

707.44 --> 710.8800000000001
hmm

708.64 --> 711.68

713.2 --> 717.519
water for my for foot bath down here

715.68 --> 719.68

717.519 --> 721.519
like doing exactly what i hoped it would

719.68 --> 723.519
do

721.519 --> 726.519
i'm gonna have to walk downstairs for a

723.519 --> 726.519
second

732.72 --> 737.44
no i don't misinterpret you because i

735.519 --> 740.16
don't because you don't think it's flat

737.44 --> 745.839
it's just weird to ask

740.16 --> 745.8389999999999
any old people died yet like dude that's

747.2 --> 750.72
that's just not right

749.2 --> 755.8000000000001
it's not because you're not a flat

750.72 --> 755.8000000000001
earther aaron armstrong be right back

797.44 --> 802.8800000000001
no aaron armstrong if you would actually

799.839 --> 804.5600000000001
present it as a question of concern

802.88 --> 806.079
you would say like ooh

804.56 --> 808.2399999999999
i yeah

806.079 --> 810.399
old people might be at risk with this

808.24 --> 812.48
heat i hope

810.399 --> 815.12
not nobody

812.48 --> 817.04
of them have succumbed to the heat

815.12 --> 819.6
of anybody that you know

817.04 --> 821.279
that may be a little bit over carefully

819.6 --> 823.76
formulated but

821.279 --> 826.32
to say it like you did seem just very

823.76 --> 826.3199999999999
heartless

826.639 --> 831.44
even though you might have intended to

828.72 --> 833.839
just go concern it's just the way you

831.44 --> 833.839
said it

834.24 --> 837.6
put his head in the fridge

839.04 --> 843.8389999999999

that's who you sound like oh my god by

892.8 --> 898.0
the way owen benjamin had this show

895.92 --> 899.519
was it from yesterday or the day before

898.0 --> 900.959
i'm not entirely sure it could have been

899.519 --> 903.6
yesterday but

900.959 --> 904.6389999999999
he was making a full item about his dad

903.6 --> 906.72
and like

904.639 --> 908.72
acting how he talks and all that i the

906.72 --> 910.639
most elaborate i've ever heard him talk

908.72 --> 913.839
about him

910.639 --> 913.839
holy [ __ ] dude

915.12 --> 921.279
i feel so good about my dad right now

918.85 --> 923.0400000000001
[Laughter]

921.279 --> 925.68
[ __ ]

923.04 --> 927.8389999999999
i mean my dad was kind of

925.68 --> 929.5999999999999
like a bit weak and like he would walk

927.839 --> 932.0790000000001
away

929.6 --> 934.9590000000001
get stressed out kind of thing like not

932.079 --> 937.199
be a very strong dad but [ __ ] oh and

934.959 --> 939.5999999999999
benjamin's dad is just

937.199 --> 941.8389999999999
dude

939.6 --> 943.839
like literally complaining to your kids

941.839 --> 947.0400000000001
that you're gonna kill yourself what the

943.839 --> 948.8000000000001
[ __ ] dude what the [ __ ]

947.04 --> 949.8
i feel for you

948.8 --> 952.24
owen

949.8 --> 956.0
[Music]

952.24 --> 959.36
but i would also like to warn you that

956.0 --> 959.36
the imprint that he makes

959.44 --> 964.32
if you don't fully fully get at peace

962.48 --> 966.16
with that you know this [ __ ] you notice

964.32 --> 967.839
through gartner i'm pretty sure you do

966.16 --> 969.279
he told you something like this he would

967.839 --> 972.639
have had to

969.279 --> 975.4399999999999
you got to be careful because

972.639 --> 975.44
if his mark

975.92 --> 979.92
integrates with you too long

978.399 --> 982.24
it might have

979.92 --> 984.4799999999999
yeah like the longer it sits the longer

982.24 --> 986.8
it takes to get it out

984.48 --> 989.6
you could potentially partially turn in

986.8 --> 991.92
your dad behavior wise not it will never

989.6 --> 994.399
be like that

991.92 --> 997.04
but you don't even want to

994.399 --> 1000.399
take one step in that direction

997.04 --> 1000.399
you don't you know you don't

1000.48 --> 1005.6800000000001
right but really

1003.199 --> 1007.5999999999999
interesting thank you very much owen

1005.68 --> 1009.519
like really thank you for sharing that

1007.6 --> 1014.0790000000001
that was like

1009.519 --> 1014.079
very revealing in a enlightening way

1014.88 --> 1017.6
you

1015.68 --> 1021.12
literally

1017.6 --> 1022.839
like emulated your dad and like i felt a

1021.12 --> 1025.839
whole bunch of

1022.839 --> 1029.679
stuff through that translation you gave

1025.839 --> 1029.6789999999999
like it was very revealing

1031.76 --> 1035.839
and i think you thought so too so that

1033.76 --> 1039.48
was great good stuff

1035.839 --> 1039.48
interesting [ __ ]

1066.16 --> 1070.88
right so my tip is guys tip for today

1071.84 --> 1076.559
you go out in the blazing hot weather

1074.08 --> 1078.799
for like biking or whatever

1076.559 --> 1081.76
and you get back

1078.799 --> 1083.679
and you want to drink something cool

1081.76 --> 1087.039
then don't

1083.679 --> 1089.2
freaking drink like raw apple juice or

1087.039 --> 1091.36
something other that is really sour even

1089.2 --> 1093.6000000000001
if it is cool and don't like gush it

1091.36 --> 1094.7199999999998
down because dude just

1093.6 --> 1096.8799999999999
water

1094.72 --> 1098.4
just water

1096.88 --> 1101.679
because this

1098.4 --> 1103.919
is still like giving me a stomach egg

1101.679 --> 1105.3600000000001
i literally have to walk up the apple

1103.919 --> 1108.64
juice like

1105.36 --> 1112.0
how weird does that even sound

1108.64 --> 1112.0
walk off the apple juice

1114.32 --> 1119.6399999999999
will computers become sentient in the

1116.16 --> 1119.64
future no

1122.0 --> 1126.559
you have to have

1123.919 --> 1126.5590000000002
a soul

1127.44 --> 1132.24
a spirit to be sentient computer is just

1130.48 --> 1135.6
an emulator

1132.24 --> 1136.88
it may be a simulacrum a copy of a

1135.6 --> 1139.52
person

1136.88 --> 1143.1200000000001
to emulate their sentience

1139.52 --> 1146.08
but it is just routines it will never be

1143.12 --> 1150.12
sentient it might emulate sentience but

1146.08 --> 1150.12
it will never be sentient

1152.96 --> 1156.96

and take it serious

1470.159 --> 1475.679
this is a workshop

1473.279 --> 1478.559
yeah this is not some

1475.679 --> 1480.0800000000002
like some backcountry french

1478.559 --> 1482.1589999999999
factory

1480.08 --> 1485.36
where everybody can just show up drunk

1482.159 --> 1487.1200000000001
or whatever yeah this is not that

1485.36 --> 1489.76
i don't know if france even still has

1487.12 --> 1492.6399999999999
those but it did like in the old old

1489.76 --> 1495.2
days 20th century that used to actually

1492.64 --> 1496.5590000000002
and spain

1495.2 --> 1498.64
places where they just didn't give a

1496.559 --> 1500.8799999999999
[ __ ] if you were drunk or not as long as

1498.64 --> 1501.76
you could still do whatever you needed

1500.88 --> 1503.5200000000002
to do

1501.76 --> 1504.96
anyway

1503.52 --> 1506.96
this is not that

1504.96 --> 1509.52
yeah this is not the chat where you show

1506.96 --> 1513.76
up drunk or where you're gonna like

1509.52 --> 1515.279
squirt over your cravings about it

1513.76 --> 1517.76
not low

1515.279 --> 1518.64
i want you to actually take it serious

1517.76 --> 1521.6
now

1518.64 --> 1521.6000000000001
and fall in line

1523.76 --> 1529.32
don't do that again

1525.36 --> 1529.32
don't bring up alcohol

1543.12 --> 1548.6399999999999
i mean i've got my eye on you

1546.24 --> 1548.64
anyway

1549.36 --> 1553.76
okay one more

1551.2 --> 1557.6000000000001
one more back talk like that and you get

1553.76 --> 1559.2
a timeout you hear me gadget inspector

1557.6 --> 1562.0
i didn't say

1559.2 --> 1562.0
you were drunk

1566.72 --> 1570.96
although yeah

1568.24 --> 1574.32
i you you think i don't remember from

1570.96 --> 1576.64
last week when you literally did do that

1574.32 --> 1579.279
and then the entire show

1576.64 --> 1582.0
turned into talking about drinking

1579.279 --> 1584.48
how to deal with that yeah

1582.0 --> 1586.799
so in that occasion i turn it into a

1584.48 --> 1587.52
theme to just move through it

1586.799 --> 1590.4
but

1587.52 --> 1591.52
i will absolutely not be making a habit

1590.4 --> 1593.919
of that

1591.52 --> 1596.48
so i'm telling you gadget inspector

1593.919 --> 1599.46
don't bring it up again during my show

1596.48 --> 1600.72
don't

1599.46 --> 1602.4
[Music]

1600.72 --> 1604.72
not as a joke

1602.4 --> 1607.52
not as a reference i don't want you to

1604.72 --> 1607.52
bring it up again

1610.799 --> 1615.2
and if you like sick from it because you

1613.12 --> 1618.8799999999999
got a hangover then i'd like you to kind

1615.2 --> 1618.88
of stay away from the chat

1622.559 --> 1627.72
because you're just gonna be dragging it

1624.4 --> 1627.72
down then

1630.48 --> 1635.6
and by the way that counts for everybody

1632.96 --> 1637.679
except maybe drunken bullet but that's

1635.6 --> 1640.0
because drunken bullet is in australia

1637.679 --> 1642.48
so the time that he tends to log on to

1640.0 --> 1644.72
my show it's very late

1642.48 --> 1648.0
that is excusable

1644.72 --> 1649.2
and he knows he's not really supposed to

1648.0 --> 1651.919
overtly

1649.2 --> 1655.6000000000001
act drunk

1651.919 --> 1658.7990000000002
and he supports my show

1655.6 --> 1661.84
that's a very important factor yeah

1658.799 --> 1666.24
financially supporting me actually give

1661.84 --> 1669.84
you some lean way to a certain degree

1666.24 --> 1669.84
a degree that i will determine

1671.279 --> 1674.96
uh

1672.399 --> 1678.9189999999999
enough about that stern win yeah better

1674.96 --> 1678.919
believe it steamy traveler

1682.399 --> 1685.6789999999999
starting to feel a bit better

1687.84 --> 1691.76
sorry

1688.88 --> 1691.7600000000002
so hot here

1693.679 --> 1696.679
right

1698.159 --> 1703.44
so yesterday bladder's debates

1701.36 --> 1707.1999999999998
it was great

1703.44 --> 1707.2
but it didn't last very long

1707.36 --> 1712.4799999999998
after show was only like

1709.52 --> 1714.799
45 minutes or so

1712.48 --> 1716.48
or less even half an hour i don't

1714.799 --> 1718.48
remember exactly but it didn't last

1716.48 --> 1720.48
super long but it was great i hope

1718.48 --> 1723.48
today's flat earth debate's gonna be

1720.48 --> 1723.48
longer

1725.12 --> 1727.4399999999998
uh

1731.039 --> 1735.039
man my computer's

1733.039 --> 1739.1589999999999
sort of having a bit of a heat issue as

1735.039 --> 1739.1589999999999
well it's constantly like

1739.5 --> 1742.579
[Music]

1747.279 --> 1750.279
okay

1753.12 --> 1757.6789999999999
oh yeah watch the movie yesterday that i

1755.679 --> 1760.3990000000001
hadn't seen yet

1757.679 --> 1766.039
or netflix

1760.399 --> 1766.039
my favorite gay programming company

1766.559 --> 1770.32
that's sarcastic

1768.08 --> 1770.32
uh

1770.72 --> 1775.64
was it again it was the spider-man movie

1780.88 --> 1785.7600000000002
no going home or something

1783.84 --> 1788.48
something with home

1785.76 --> 1793.12
but it is like a multiverse branch dude

1788.48 --> 1797.1200000000001
i freaking muted you you piece of [ __ ]

1793.12 --> 1799.1999999999998
just i muted it it just didn't do it

1797.12 --> 1801.1999999999998
just didn't do it

1799.2 --> 1804.72
thanks you could have just caused me my

1801.2 --> 1804.72
monetization you [ __ ]

1807.52 --> 1812.72
anyway

1809.44 --> 1814.799
that was a goofy ass but still extremely

1812.72 --> 1816.559
interesting movie

1814.799 --> 1818.6399999999999
because like all the spider-man

1816.559 --> 1820.48
characters from previous movies got

1818.64 --> 1823.919
together

1820.48 --> 1824.799
and they were all like really in it

1823.919 --> 1828.159
so

1824.799 --> 1830.559
it was weird and goofy and

1828.159 --> 1832.0800000000002
it was like the ultimate mixer of all

1830.559 --> 1834.399
the spiderman

1832.08 --> 1836.72
yeah all the different movie

1834.399 --> 1838.799
branches and they basically tied it

1836.72 --> 1840.0
together

1838.799 --> 1842.0
into

1840.0 --> 1844.799
a multiverse story

1842.0 --> 1847.279
but i thought it was great

1844.799 --> 1850.799
i mean it was goofy as [ __ ] and like

1847.279 --> 1855.919
nonsense action like oh yes spiderman oh

1850.799 --> 1855.9189999999999
he's gonna be punched through the floor

1856.0 --> 1859.84
okay

1857.279 --> 1862.48
that sort of dumb dumb [ __ ]

1859.84 --> 1865.36
like and even like with the what is it

1862.48 --> 1867.2
one of the opponents

1865.36 --> 1869.6
it's the green goblin

1867.2 --> 1872.24
like uh i'm pretty sure that the green

1869.6 --> 1873.4399999999998
goblin didn't have like

1872.24 --> 1876.0
spider

1873.44 --> 1878.24
superhuman strength and he was bashed

1876.0 --> 1880.08
through walls as well like yeah you

1878.24 --> 1882.32
should be completely dead when that

1880.08 --> 1884.6399999999999
happens

1882.32 --> 1886.72
maybe i misremembered it

1884.64 --> 1890.24
it's been a while since i saw that very

1886.72 --> 1890.24
old version of spiderman

1891.44 --> 1897.2
spider-man is gay yeah a little

1894.48 --> 1899.44
yeah maybe a much

1897.2 --> 1900.96
it is certainly like completely getting

1899.44 --> 1904.3200000000002
consumed by

1900.96 --> 1907.44
sjw nonsense overall

1904.32 --> 1910.24
but just as a movie i thought it was

1907.44 --> 1912.64
kind of cool especially having all those

1910.24 --> 1915.44
spidermans get together and like have

1912.64 --> 1918.96
conversations and really be their

1915.44 --> 1920.88
original spiderman also it was awesome

1918.96 --> 1924.08
seeing doc ock back

1920.88 --> 1926.159
and having him even turn into

1924.08 --> 1928.8799999999999
yeah maybe a bit of spoilers if you

1926.159 --> 1931.2
hadn't seen it but turn him sort of like

1928.88 --> 1933.919
get him to turn into a good guy because

1931.2 --> 1936.159
i freaking love that character i did not

1933.919 --> 1937.679
really care for the old spider-man movie

1936.159 --> 1941.679
spider-man 2

1937.679 --> 1943.039
but doc ock in that was just so freaking

1941.679 --> 1945.279
awesome

1943.039 --> 1948.799
like that the actor and

1945.279 --> 1953.679
just how he acted is so great and it was

1948.799 --> 1953.679
great to see him back great loved it

1954.72 --> 1962.559
no way home that's the one yeah yeah

1957.84 --> 1965.76
far from home now it was the no way home

1962.559 --> 1966.6399999999999
i haven't seen far from home

1965.76 --> 1968.8799999999999
yet

1966.64 --> 1971.279
anyway this just popped up and was

1968.88 --> 1973.8400000000001
pretty damn cool i thought or at least

1971.279 --> 1976.84
it was entertaining like marvel style

1973.84 --> 1976.84
entertaining

1977.039 --> 1980.399
and i've seen worse

1978.72 --> 1982.64
and i do kind of like this new

1980.399 --> 1985.84
spider-man actor i like him as

1982.64 --> 1988.0
spider-man he's pretty cool

1985.84 --> 1989.039
but it was really fun to just see them

1988.0 --> 1991.84
all

1989.039 --> 1994.64
together again also getting annoyed by

1991.84 --> 1997.9189999999999
the formula of spider-man also it's

1994.64 --> 2000.3200000000002
getting really old now that formula i

1997.919 --> 2003.279
mean yeah sure it still works but it's

2000.32 --> 2005.279
getting so old like it's getting so old

2003.279 --> 2007.44
that even like

2005.279 --> 2009.519
the characters in movies now are

2007.44 --> 2011.679
starting to make jokes about that sort

2009.519 --> 2013.679
of thing almost

2011.679 --> 2015.3600000000001
they're they're

2013.679 --> 2017.519
getting old with it even though it's

2015.36 --> 2019.6
like oh but that was like the first time

2017.519 --> 2021.84
it's being said

2019.6 --> 2023.9189999999999
yeah but the everybody all the actors

2021.84 --> 2026.72
they all heard it so to them it's just

2023.919 --> 2028.96
old now like yeah we freaking get it

2026.72 --> 2032.519
already been hearing that for like 80

2028.96 --> 2032.519
years or something

2032.559 --> 2038.32
it's getting really old

2035.84 --> 2040.9599999999998
right but

2038.32 --> 2042.72
still pretty cool movie i did not care

2040.96 --> 2044.48
for the

2042.72 --> 2046.24
the news guy

2044.48 --> 2048.079
right who's always after spiderman

2046.24 --> 2050.24
they'd literally turn him into some

2048.079 --> 2053.52
stupid-ass

2050.24 --> 2056.4799999999996
alex jones cnn hybrid i mean that was

2053.52 --> 2058.72
just so annoying like as far as i'm

2056.48 --> 2062.2400000000002
concerned they could just literally cut

2058.72 --> 2064.0789999999997
that out of the movie entirely

2062.24 --> 2067.2
and the movie would have been better for

2064.079 --> 2070.079
it like it was completely annoying and

2067.2 --> 2070.0789999999997
superfluous

2070.96 --> 2074.399
i mean why

2072.56 --> 2077.2799999999997
why did you do that that was just

2074.399 --> 2077.2799999999997
[ __ ] annoying

2079.28 --> 2082.7200000000003
anyway

2080.24 --> 2082.72
so yeah

2083.52 --> 2087.52
interesting parts

2085.2 --> 2090.0
and really annoying parts

2087.52 --> 2092.96
and just like corny [ __ ]

2090.0 --> 2095.52
like okay we get it already

2092.96 --> 2096.56
but still like they still did

2095.52 --> 2098.64
something

2096.56 --> 2102.0789999999997
interesting with it also yeah

2098.64 --> 2103.92
what is it doctor strange

2102.079 --> 2106.48
the wizard

2103.92 --> 2108.7200000000003
the sorcerer supreme or something he was

2106.48 --> 2111.119
also in there it was basically a

2108.72 --> 2112.72
[ __ ] of marvel stuff like that

2111.119 --> 2114.48
really it was

2112.72 --> 2116.3999999999996
still interesting i have never even

2114.48 --> 2119.599
actually seen like the

2116.4 --> 2123.28
doctor strange movie

2119.599 --> 2125.28
or if i have i've i've forgotten it

2123.28 --> 2126.96
i should watch it

2125.28 --> 2129.76
it was just that when the time that it

2126.96 --> 2131.52
came out i was just like not ready for

2129.76 --> 2135.3590000000004
that

2131.52 --> 2135.359
anyhow so let's move on

2137.599 --> 2142.0
yeah anyway thank you pgcnet for linking

2140.64 --> 2145.839
up those titles

2142.0 --> 2145.839
it was far from home

2148.8 --> 2155.28
right and it's it's goofy

2151.76 --> 2157.44
it's spider-man it is typical spider-man

2155.28 --> 2160.079
it's just i really like the character

2157.44 --> 2162.7200000000003
the spider-man coming together i liked

2160.079 --> 2164.48
it i thought it was like that gave me a

2162.72 --> 2167.1189999999997
good feeling

2164.48 --> 2167.119
i liked it

2169.359 --> 2175.2799999999997
five out of ten a bit cheesy okay

2172.96 --> 2175.28
fine

2175.68 --> 2181.52
i mean all marvel movies are like that

2178.16 --> 2183.92
now they're all like that i just really

2181.52 --> 2188.0
like this spider-man getting together

2183.92 --> 2190.2400000000002
and it's almost gave me a feeling like

2188.0 --> 2193.28
they had chemistry

2190.24 --> 2195.4399999999996
you should do this again sometime

2193.28 --> 2197.76
i'm not joking like they should do that

2195.44 --> 2199.52
again they didn't kill off any of the

2197.76 --> 2201.4
spiderman

2199.52 --> 2202.56
and they should do it again i mean

2201.4 --> 2204.96
[Music]

2202.56 --> 2207.119
go go spider-man

2204.96 --> 2208.8
what do you mean spider-man no

2207.119 --> 2210.6400000000003
spider-men

2208.8 --> 2214.96
they're all

2210.64 --> 2218.0789999999997
they're multiple spider-man spider-man

2214.96 --> 2218.079
i thought it was pretty cool

2218.72 --> 2223.64
like as soon as they started to join up

2223.83 --> 2227.04
[Music]

2228.0 --> 2232.16
the waters above comet

2229.839 --> 2232.16
what

2232.48 --> 2236.0
what are you talking about

2234.56 --> 2241.72
salty

2236.0 --> 2241.72
sea dog amigo welcome to my chat

2245.2 --> 2250.7999999999997
yeah cgi was really good yeah i agree

2248.48 --> 2251.68
gadget inspector the cgi from the movie

2250.8 --> 2253.92
was

2251.68 --> 2255.7599999999998
like yeah

2253.92 --> 2258.56
no

2255.76 --> 2260.96
ugly or stupid no it was good

2258.56 --> 2262.24
but look they've perfected how to do

2260.96 --> 2265.92
that by now

2262.24 --> 2268.24
i mean it's not the first marvel movie

2265.92 --> 2270.88
i mean how much have they made now 50 or

2268.24 --> 2272.4799999999996
something they've had a lot of practice

2270.88 --> 2274.1600000000003
to get this sort of thing right and they

2272.48 --> 2277.68
know what they're doing now

2274.16 --> 2277.68
and that shows in this one

2278.88 --> 2283.839
right doesn't make all the characters

2280.96 --> 2286.48
automatically cool or the story more

2283.839 --> 2289.44
competent like they even make fun of how

2286.48 --> 2292.64
ridiculous it is in this movie how they

2289.44 --> 2292.64
got their superpowers

2293.119 --> 2296.1600000000003
like

2293.92 --> 2297.28
all of them they all talk about

2296.16 --> 2300.72
yeah

2297.28 --> 2303.119
oh i got it like this oh

2300.72 --> 2305.4399999999996
well we seem to be falling into some

2303.119 --> 2308.7200000000003
hazardous thing and then turning into

2305.44 --> 2310.7200000000003
into gaining superpowers right lit

2308.72 --> 2312.8799999999997
something like that it was hilarious i i

2310.72 --> 2314.7999999999997
thought that was kind of funny

2312.88 --> 2318.32
that they said that

2314.8 --> 2321.04
because it is that silly it really is

2318.32 --> 2321.04
in the story

2324.0 --> 2328.88
but you gotta remember that spider-man

2326.079 --> 2331.2000000000003
is basically like born from what is it

2328.88 --> 2333.92
from the silver age

2331.2 --> 2334.96
so or even the golden age i'm not sure

2333.92 --> 2337.44
comics

2334.96 --> 2339.68
so it went through the silver age at

2337.44 --> 2341.44
least so there's there is like because

2339.68 --> 2343.839
of the silver age there's so much

2341.44 --> 2345.839
goofiness

2343.839 --> 2349.04
that is in there that is like

2345.839 --> 2351.04
like really annoyingly absurd like it's

2349.04 --> 2353.2799999999997
not even funny anymore how incredibly

2351.04 --> 2355.359
absurd and stupid it is it's like dude

2353.28 --> 2356.8
stop eating those mushrooms whatever

2355.359 --> 2360.24
mushrooms you've been eating you got to

2356.8 --> 2364.48
stop this is too much

2360.24 --> 2364.4799999999996
yeah that's silver age comics

2367.68 --> 2372.64
and spider-man went through that as well

2369.76 --> 2374.079
and that has left its traces through

2372.64 --> 2376.7999999999997
what is it the original guy that

2374.079 --> 2378.4
designed him he went through all that

2376.8 --> 2381.04
and so he's just

2378.4 --> 2383.599
done it like that and spider-man has

2381.04 --> 2386.48
this franchise has goofy traits because

2383.599 --> 2391.04
of the silver age

2386.48 --> 2391.04
what moonfall is terrible good

2392.56 --> 2398.0
oh you mean the uh

2395.28 --> 2399.6800000000003
leonardo dicaprio movie

2398.0 --> 2400.1
yeah

2399.68 --> 2401.359
i mean

2400.1 --> 2404.4
[Music]

2401.359 --> 2406.56
it was chock full of programming

2404.4 --> 2408.96
but it was

2406.56 --> 2411.2799999999997
interesting it was an interesting movie

2408.96 --> 2413.04
i thought it was interesting to watch it

2411.28 --> 2415.28
they had they had

2413.04 --> 2417.119
pretty decent social commentary and that

2415.28 --> 2419.6800000000003
is rare for any hollywood movie

2417.119 --> 2423.6400000000003
especially blockbusters to have actual

2419.68 --> 2423.64
decent social commentary

2426.0 --> 2430.88
oh marvel's owned by disney now oh jesus

2429.68 --> 2433.2
uh

2430.88 --> 2438.119
well it's a miracle that that it hasn't

2433.2 --> 2438.1189999999997
completely self-destructed yet then

2441.92 --> 2446.319
moonfall is a new movie out what

2446.48 --> 2450.8
oh wait no i was thinking about don't

2448.4 --> 2450.8
look up

2451.04 --> 2455.7599999999998
a moon fall oh wait there was a trailer

2453.119 --> 2455.76
for that right

2456.64 --> 2460.16
i don't remember a trailer

2460.56 --> 2463.359
is it out yet

2464.64 --> 2471.0789999999997
when when did it get out

2466.88 --> 2471.079
tomorrow or gadget inspector

2484.8 --> 2487.92
early 2020

2488.28 --> 2492.92
2022 right oh

2494.24 --> 2498.3999999999996
hmm i could download that

2496.48 --> 2500.72
then

2498.4 --> 2504.52
it's called moonfall

2500.72 --> 2504.52
i think i'll try that

2504.68 --> 2507.739
[Music]

2509.119 --> 2514.56
i remember having watched the trailer

2510.72 --> 2514.56
and that was like interesting

2519.119 --> 2524.6400000000003
brain off movie okay

2521.52 --> 2524.64
i'll keep that in mind

2524.69 --> 2527.7690000000002
[Music]

2534.319 --> 2537.319
okay

2561.09 --> 2570.869
[Music]

2574.24 --> 2577.5989999999997
ah

2575.119 --> 2577.9900000000002
yep it's out

2577.599 --> 2581.13
hmm

2577.99 --> 2581.1299999999997
[Music]

2583.28 --> 2589.079
there's this area one see a lot of web

2585.599 --> 2589.079
rips but

2605.2 --> 2609.4399999999996
okay let's hope this works

2616.0 --> 2621.839
but yeah thanks for reminding me

2618.4 --> 2621.839
completely forgot about it

2622.8 --> 2630.04
then again i don't really keep track of

2626.0 --> 2630.04
movies all that much

2635.2 --> 2639.4399999999996
i'm usually very late with movies

2637.68 --> 2641.839
because then i can just watch him for

2639.44 --> 2641.839
free

2643.359 --> 2648.7999999999997
and then i can talk about it expecting

2645.839 --> 2650.7999999999997
that most will have seen it right

2648.8 --> 2652.5600000000004
i really don't like to be that guy

2650.8 --> 2655.2000000000003
that's like oh it just came out i have

2652.56 --> 2657.2
to review it now

2655.2 --> 2661.04
because that's like higher standards and

2657.2 --> 2663.04
it's a different dynamic and like

2661.04 --> 2664.8
grabblers are gonna get excited if you

2663.04 --> 2667.44
do that

2664.8 --> 2668.319
so i don't do that i leave that too like

2667.44 --> 2670.7200000000003
more

2668.319 --> 2671.7599999999998
professional movie reviewers even though

2670.72 --> 2674.72
they

2671.76 --> 2676.9100000000003
end up sucking because of that

2674.72 --> 2680.3599999999997
uh

2676.91 --> 2680.3599999999997
[Music]

2685.44 --> 2689.359
it's truth in plain sight really

2689.44 --> 2694.64
how do i get free movies

2692.48 --> 2696.88
well technically nobody gets three

2694.64 --> 2699.5989999999997
movies they all cost money

2696.88 --> 2701.599
it's just that

2699.599 --> 2704.0
after a while

2701.599 --> 2705.839
they get pretty much cracked and

2704.0 --> 2709.52
distributed and i still get it through

2705.839 --> 2709.52
pirate bay through vpn

2710.8 --> 2716.96
although it doesn't always work

2714.319 --> 2719.2
sometimes their site is down sometimes

2716.96 --> 2721.839
is they have like major blockages and

2719.2 --> 2724.0789999999997
[ __ ] and like even through vpn you just

2721.839 --> 2727.92
can't get to him

2724.079 --> 2727.92
and other times this just works fine

2728.8 --> 2734.2400000000002
cody for me okay i don't know what that

2730.8 --> 2736.079
is but fine probably more sources i like

2734.24 --> 2740.16
to stick to what i know and i've known

2736.079 --> 2740.1600000000003
pirate bay for like 20 years

2740.56 --> 2745.4
i'm glad they're still doing it

2746.12 --> 2749.27
[Music]

2765.92 --> 2770.8
easy enough to use an up to date

2768.4 --> 2770.8
okay

2771.52 --> 2775.839
pre was decent

2782.4 --> 2787.88
free yeah so inspired baby pirate bass

2784.56 --> 2787.88
free too

2800.24 --> 2803.24
hmm

2804.0 --> 2808.72
yeah pgc yeah they're all like under

2806.56 --> 2810.7999999999997
heavy attack which is not surprising of

2808.72 --> 2813.839
course because they they want full

2810.8 --> 2815.119
indoctrination monopoly

2813.839 --> 2817.359
right and by

2815.119 --> 2820.079
people ripping it and distributing it

2817.359 --> 2822.7999999999997
it's just they can't track it

2820.079 --> 2825.3590000000004
because they they want to get to the

2822.8 --> 2828.1600000000003
point in the future it's not ever going

2825.359 --> 2829.5989999999997
to get there i hope

2828.16 --> 2831.92
where they want

2829.599 --> 2835.52
to know exactly

2831.92 --> 2837.6800000000003
what happens to everybody all the time

2835.52 --> 2840.559
so they want to then like have these

2837.68 --> 2841.839
movies made and then know exactly who

2840.559 --> 2845.7200000000003
watched them

2841.839 --> 2845.72
where and when

2846.079 --> 2851.8390000000004
so they can then unleash their

2848.72 --> 2853.9199999999996
programming algorithms onto that

2851.839 --> 2857.68
and predicting capabilities so that they

2853.92 --> 2860.2400000000002
know exactly according to their models

2857.68 --> 2862.72
they can literally just

2860.24 --> 2865.2
like decide for people how they're going

2862.72 --> 2866.0
to develop that's what they want they

2865.2 --> 2869.68
want

2866.0 --> 2873.359
the mind control people into

2869.68 --> 2874.96
becoming like programmable robots

2873.359 --> 2878.24
that don't even know that they're

2874.96 --> 2878.2400000000002
programmable robots

2880.48 --> 2883.119
that's what they want with all the

2881.92 --> 2886.559
tracking

2883.119 --> 2890.1600000000003
and all the digital ids and the cashless

2886.559 --> 2892.48
society this is exactly what they want

2890.16 --> 2895.7599999999998
out of it they want to turn everybody

2892.48 --> 2900.48
into programmable robots that don't even

2895.76 --> 2903.0400000000004
realize that they're programmable robots

2900.48 --> 2904.72
keep track of everything and then every

2903.04 --> 2908.24
piece of media

2904.72 --> 2909.68
every trick every ad that is inserted

2908.24 --> 2910.72
could be

2909.68 --> 2915.48
kept

2910.72 --> 2915.48
track of for each individual

2915.52 --> 2920.64
so that exact programming can be

2918.559 --> 2923.44
predicted

2920.64 --> 2925.68
through their algorithms and [ __ ] is

2923.44 --> 2928.4
pure hive mind control

2925.68 --> 2932.7999999999997
what they really want with it it's why

2928.4 --> 2935.6800000000003
you should never go full digital never

2932.8 --> 2936.6400000000003
always have cash

2935.68 --> 2938.319
right

2936.64 --> 2940.839
always have

2938.319 --> 2942.64
paper identificat

2940.839 --> 2944.96
identification

2942.64 --> 2947.04
just everything that we do

2944.96 --> 2950.559
that is part of our society should

2947.04 --> 2954.48
always have a paper option always always

2950.559 --> 2956.6400000000003
always always always have mail

2954.48 --> 2960.319
never only email

2956.64 --> 2962.72
or some stupid digital board

2960.319 --> 2964.16
always have mail

2962.72 --> 2966.8799999999997
everything

2964.16 --> 2969.359
should never let any of that be taken

2966.88 --> 2972.4
from you as a society because there's

2969.359 --> 2975.52
only one thing that that leads to

2972.4 --> 2979.04
hive mind control

2975.52 --> 2982.16
and they've done their best to do that

2979.04 --> 2986.0
exact thing in china for quite a while

2982.16 --> 2989.5989999999997
as everybody is well aware of

2986.0 --> 2989.599
i mean it's right there

2989.68 --> 2994.96
it's right there how they do that

2992.0 --> 2997.28
and oh they're communist yes yes and we

2994.96 --> 3000.16
are so much better than the communists

2997.28 --> 3000.1600000000003
over here i mean

3000.319 --> 3006.319
i mean we're the shining example of

3003.04 --> 3007.44
justice and democracy here right

3006.319 --> 3008.48
no

3007.44 --> 3011.119
no

3008.48 --> 3014.72
so you can count on them

3011.119 --> 3017.2000000000003
doing the exact same thing over here

3014.72 --> 3019.4399999999996
and potentially worse in ways that china

3017.2 --> 3022.5589999999997
isn't even doing

3019.44 --> 3024.079
because it's not the same group yeah

3022.559 --> 3028.2400000000002
china

3024.079 --> 3032.2400000000002
globalists are not the same group

3028.24 --> 3034.9599999999996
they're actually more like competitors

3032.24 --> 3039.0789999999997
that might conspire together whenever

3034.96 --> 3039.079
it's convenient for both

3041.04 --> 3047.16
they're not friends and they're not

3043.599 --> 3047.1600000000003
really allies

3054.8 --> 3059.04
i think sometimes china is only really

3056.88 --> 3061.2000000000003
going along with this because it is

3059.04 --> 3063.2
keeping their industry going

3061.2 --> 3065.68
and because the west is just [ __ ]

3063.2 --> 3067.7599999999998
themselves up and that means they will

3065.68 --> 3069.5989999999997
be less of a threat

3067.76 --> 3072.559
i think that's the reason why china is

3069.599 --> 3072.559
even doing all this

3073.119 --> 3077.44
and hopefully yeah they probably also

3075.359 --> 3079.839
just want to buy out america through all

3077.44 --> 3079.839
the debt

3080.079 --> 3086.0
they just want to buy it

3082.96 --> 3086.0
just like in the ad

3091.2 --> 3094.2
anyway

3101.44 --> 3105.599
insisting to copyright infringement of

3104.48 --> 3109.16
course

3105.599 --> 3109.1600000000003
of course they did

3121.52 --> 3126.079
all right but pirate bay is still up so

3123.839 --> 3128.0789999999997
i don't know if those guys that were

3126.079 --> 3130.079
phone guilty the founders if they're

3128.079 --> 3132.96
even officially involved anymore it's

3130.079 --> 3135.52
probably done they just went underground

3132.96 --> 3137.44
completely now

3135.52 --> 3141.52
i think that at first they might have

3137.44 --> 3143.839
just had an official representation

3141.52 --> 3146.48
because they were hoping

3143.839 --> 3148.72
you know pirate bay had a mission

3146.48 --> 3150.48
it's not just oh it provides free [ __ ]

3148.72 --> 3153.1189999999997
no they had a mission

3150.48 --> 3154.64
you see there's this effect

3153.119 --> 3158.319
doing what they do

3154.64 --> 3161.359
having things available for free

3158.319 --> 3164.48
it actually spreads information

3161.359 --> 3164.48
it helps build up

3165.359 --> 3169.44
right

3166.64 --> 3172.48
if you could only ever get anything like

3169.44 --> 3174.64
that by paying for it then that means

3172.48 --> 3177.119
there would be less spread

3174.64 --> 3179.839
and that would even feed back

3177.119 --> 3181.599
yeah yeah on the very companies making

3179.839 --> 3184.48
those movies

3181.599 --> 3185.52
getting less feedback

3184.48 --> 3188.0
and then

3185.52 --> 3190.72
your movies are not going to be

3188.0 --> 3193.839
refined as much through all the

3190.72 --> 3195.5989999999997
criticism because the sheer percentage

3193.839 --> 3197.04
of people that have watched your

3195.599 --> 3198.119
products

3197.04 --> 3200.96
will be

3198.119 --> 3204.2400000000002
significantly less so you will have less

3200.96 --> 3206.48
constructive feedback

3204.24 --> 3206.4799999999996
yeah

3207.04 --> 3211.119
so in the end

3209.28 --> 3213.44
having movies and

3211.119 --> 3215.359
even games but especially movies for

3213.44 --> 3217.52
free available

3215.359 --> 3220.0
right oh they might cut into some of the

3217.52 --> 3223.04
profits yeah but it literally

3220.0 --> 3226.24
keeps your freaking industry alive

3223.04 --> 3226.24
you ever considered that

3226.559 --> 3231.52
i mean what the hell would you even be

3228.88 --> 3235.4
without the massive feedback that you've

3231.52 --> 3235.4
gotten over the years

3238.48 --> 3243.44
right but that didn't really officially

3240.8 --> 3245.8390000000004
yeah it didn't turn out like

3243.44 --> 3248.64
like that

3245.839 --> 3251.2
there was no giant swing around

3248.64 --> 3253.2
oh even during trump

3251.2 --> 3254.93
and

3253.2 --> 3257.9689999999996
yeah they just got

3254.93 --> 3257.969
[Music]

3259.359 --> 3264.2799999999997
pushed

3260.48 --> 3264.28
more and more anyway

3265.359 --> 3269.839
why do i use goofy voice when you read

3268.559 --> 3271.8390000000004
quest

3269.839 --> 3273.7599999999998
well as to not

3271.839 --> 3275.839
i do it on purpose

3273.76 --> 3280.559
to kind of

3275.839 --> 3283.68
give borders to something i'm saying

3280.559 --> 3286.1600000000003
and to when i'm just talking it's i do

3283.68 --> 3286.16
voices

3286.799 --> 3291.839
don't ask me that damn it it's just how

3289.44 --> 3293.839
i do it

3291.839 --> 3294.799
especially if i'm gonna say something

3293.839 --> 3298.0789999999997
really

3294.799 --> 3300.799
dark or [ __ ] up that i that i like

3298.079 --> 3302.4
never will agree to then i'll use a

3300.799 --> 3304.64
weird voice

3302.4 --> 3307.839
because i don't want

3304.64 --> 3309.44
to have me on camera saying that clear

3307.839 --> 3310.64
voiced

3309.44 --> 3313.28
you see

3310.64 --> 3314.96
that's part of the reason

3313.28 --> 3316.6400000000003
and just do it

3314.96 --> 3318.88
i do it

3316.64 --> 3321.44
if i don't like the frequency in some

3318.88 --> 3322.48
way and it might be a long-term threat a

3321.44 --> 3324.96
threat

3322.48 --> 3326.319
or a minor threat

3324.96 --> 3329.68
then i'll

3326.319 --> 3334.119
warp my voice slightly in order to

3329.68 --> 3334.1189999999997
prevent that it is a system

3336.319 --> 3339.599
right

3337.599 --> 3340.6400000000003
i mean you could get all like oh i'm

3339.599 --> 3343.28
gonna

3340.64 --> 3345.68
use another word or or you could just

3343.28 --> 3348.7200000000003
say it in a bit of a weird voice or just

3345.68 --> 3351.2
kind of extravagant and then like oh no

3348.72 --> 3353.52
there's a recording in 20 years during

3351.2 --> 3355.52
the trial of whatever

3353.52 --> 3357.92
and what are they gonna do show that

3355.52 --> 3359.599
clip of me saying it all goofy like

3357.92 --> 3363.2000000000003
who's gonna think that that's actually

3359.599 --> 3364.7200000000003
me really making that statement then see

3363.2 --> 3366.96
this is for

3364.72 --> 3372.0
later

3366.96 --> 3372.0
basically it is my improvised form of

3373.2 --> 3377.64
legally smoothing it out

3378.559 --> 3384.3190000000004
it's purely intuitive purely

3381.92 --> 3386.7200000000003
only on intuition

3384.319 --> 3388.799
i'm just always expecting some wannabe

3386.72 --> 3390.9599999999996
blackmail piece of [ __ ] sitting

3388.799 --> 3393.119
somewhere with a recorder

3390.96 --> 3394.559
i'm just always expecting that and yeah

3393.119 --> 3399.28
that includes

3394.559 --> 3399.28
in periods when i get all berserk

3399.839 --> 3403.48
including then

3407.04 --> 3410.88
why didn't i read

3408.799 --> 3413.52
goofy voice when reading your goofy

3410.88 --> 3418.599
voice question

3413.52 --> 3418.599
because it wasn't a goofy question

3419.359 --> 3424.0
you don't ask goofy questions you you're

3421.68 --> 3426.319
always very mechanical in your questions

3424.0 --> 3428.96
you probably have a slight autistic

3426.319 --> 3430.48
spectrum thing going just like me maybe

3428.96 --> 3434.799
worse

3430.48 --> 3434.799
and you just no don't do that

3435.599 --> 3440.7200000000003
i've seen you

3437.52 --> 3443.359
either you could be ticked off offbeat

3440.72 --> 3445.2799999999997
or you can be just very serious and

3443.359 --> 3446.48
systematic very

3445.28 --> 3447.6800000000003
delta

3446.48 --> 3450.4
and i

3447.68 --> 3452.48
why would i read that with a goofy voice

3450.4 --> 3455.44
i mean gadget inspector says a lot of

3452.48 --> 3457.839
goofy [ __ ] and i will say it in a goofy

3455.44 --> 3463.76
voice at times because he is kind of

3457.839 --> 3463.7599999999998
goofy in ways you know that you're not

3465.2 --> 3471.0
i mean it take you very serious

3467.44 --> 3471.0
that's a good thing

3474.16 --> 3477.04
few years ago yeah

3486.64 --> 3490.799
for endless mirrors yeah yeah yeah yeah

3488.72 --> 3492.319
pj i seen it yeah i know

3490.799 --> 3494.799
they have endless mirrors that's why

3492.319 --> 3496.88
it's there's always a pirate bay up

3494.799 --> 3498.64
somewhere somehow

3496.88 --> 3502.76
i don't even understand how that works

3498.64 --> 3502.7599999999998
but it is and it's awesome

3506.88 --> 3510.88
oh man i'm feeling so much better now

3511.2 --> 3516.8799999999997
oh the wind has picked up

3514.24 --> 3518.799
wow

3516.88 --> 3521.119
literally just happening right in front

3518.799 --> 3521.119
of you

3521.44 --> 3526.96
but i feel so much better now god i felt

3524.0 --> 3529.04
terrible an hour ago

3526.96 --> 3531.68
ah

3529.04 --> 3533.68
and the sun is no longer hitting the

3531.68 --> 3537.72
wall

3533.68 --> 3537.72
i feel great now

3538.1 --> 3541.139
[Music]

3549.2 --> 3552.64
ah

3550.24 --> 3552.64
great

3555.119 --> 3559.079
it's like a mirror yeah

3562.319 --> 3565.7599999999998
i can't stop the signal

3566.88 --> 3572.079
right

3568.16 --> 3574.96
i'm releasing endless mirrors

3572.079 --> 3578.319
you too can have a nice breeze

3574.96 --> 3578.319
coming at you right now

3585.2 --> 3589.04
or like a big storm like owen benjamin

3587.76 --> 3590.4
had

3589.04 --> 3593.04
was it

3590.4 --> 3593.04
yesterday

3593.52 --> 3599.48
had a bit of a lightning storm that he

3595.52 --> 3599.48
tried to catch on camera

3608.24 --> 3614.9599999999996
wow okay so i guess today turned into a

3610.72 --> 3617.5989999999997
halfway decent show after all

3614.96 --> 3617.599
that's great

3619.68 --> 3622.96
okay just

3621.04 --> 3624.96
never forget don't

3622.96 --> 3628.48
drink

3624.96 --> 3630.319
like raw apple juice on an empty stomach

3628.48 --> 3632.48
when you're dehydrated

3630.319 --> 3635.2799999999997
just drink water

3632.48 --> 3635.28
don't forget

3638.319 --> 3642.079
it might have been a little bit more

3639.68 --> 3644.64
than that it probably was like a very

3642.079 --> 3648.0
slight heat stroke or something

3644.64 --> 3648.0
just got way too hot

3648.96 --> 3653.839
but yeah the apple juice did not help

3652.0 --> 3656.48
anyway hello rick peck

3653.839 --> 3656.48
let's see you

3657.28 --> 3662.8390000000004
what is that

3659.28 --> 3662.8390000000004
is that an actor

3688.799 --> 3691.119
hmm

3692.88 --> 3698.4
okay i think i remember

3696.319 --> 3701.7599999999998
somebody brought the aim up

3698.4 --> 3704.559
a while ago let me google them

3701.76 --> 3704.559
for the picture

3707.68 --> 3710.839
oh yeah

3723.68 --> 3726.68
88

3741.839 --> 3748.119
psychedelic movement

3745.119 --> 3748.119
what

3756.079 --> 3760.6400000000003
the u.s psychedelic movement what the

3758.88 --> 3764.119
hell

3760.64 --> 3764.1189999999997
what does that mean

3779.599 --> 3782.599
hmm

3784.799 --> 3789.359
hey the studio good to see you it's been

3787.039 --> 3789.3590000000004
a while

3795.28 --> 3798.2400000000002
how have you been doing

3801.039 --> 3807.2400000000002
just recovering from a slight heat

3803.599 --> 3807.2400000000002
stroke over here

3811.76 --> 3816.2400000000002
oh man

3813.68 --> 3817.9199999999996
oh it's so much better here now like

3816.24 --> 3821.52
even my

3817.92 --> 3823.359
my fan from my computer is not just like

3821.52 --> 3825.44
[Music]

3823.359 --> 3828.0789999999997
it's even like

3825.44 --> 3828.079
cooling down

3829.119 --> 3835.079
cold in melbourne australia

3831.039 --> 3835.079
oh right yeah you're in australia

3846.319 --> 3851.96
although it's probably not that cold

3848.96 --> 3851.96
right

3852.4 --> 3858.28
i mean it's not freezing there

3854.799 --> 3858.28
i take it

3879.839 --> 3881.92
you

3903.76 --> 3907.039
oh yeah

3905.52 --> 3908.96
almost forgot

3907.039 --> 3912.1600000000003
quantum of conscious had a really

3908.96 --> 3914.799
interesting video yesterday about karma

3912.16 --> 3916.8799999999997
a little karma debate

3914.799 --> 3920.359
it was great

3916.88 --> 3920.359
i also commented

3937.92 --> 3941.88
so yeah check it out

3951.82 --> 3965.2490000000003
[Music]

3966.72 --> 3969.72
so

3970.78 --> 3973.8590000000004
[Music]

3978.81 --> 3987.0299999999997
[Music]

4018.799 --> 4022.079
that is great and miss anything he puts

4020.72 --> 4023.4399999999996
out all right

4022.079 --> 4025.52
i don't think everything he does is

4023.44 --> 4027.839
great but a lot of things he does is

4025.52 --> 4027.839
great

4028.319 --> 4031.68
sometimes he gets a little

4032.4 --> 4035.4
slippery

4036.559 --> 4041.8390000000004
like a little spiritually liberal in a

4038.799 --> 4043.839
way that i do not appreciate

4041.839 --> 4046.0789999999997
it's his own freaking life though you

4043.839 --> 4046.0789999999997
know

4046.48 --> 4050.48
his seductions not mine

4050.559 --> 4054.3190000000004
but yeah

4051.76 --> 4056.4
i like when he's on a roll with his

4054.319 --> 4058.079
thinking that's when things get

4056.4 --> 4060.7200000000003
interesting

4058.079 --> 4063.92
but i definitely do not agree with every

4060.72 --> 4067.2
freaking opinion he's he's had so far

4063.92 --> 4069.599
and i do think he's kind of a solipsist

4067.2 --> 4071.9199999999996
i really do

4069.599 --> 4071.92
i mean

4072.88 --> 4076.079
just

4074.0 --> 4077.52
if you just put it all together what are

4076.079 --> 4080.96
you saying and where it's going it's

4077.52 --> 4082.559
like yeah yeah he is a solipsist

4080.96 --> 4084.96
it doesn't really matter what you think

4082.559 --> 4086.96
about that or what he thinks about that

4084.96 --> 4089.68
effectively through the things that he

4086.96 --> 4093.039
says if he actually means them

4089.68 --> 4093.0389999999998
then he's a solipsist

4098.319 --> 4102.839000000001
a what come on steamy traveler you're

4100.799 --> 4106.239
not serious death

4102.839 --> 4109.04
studio what the [ __ ] dudes you know what

4106.239 --> 4110.879999999999
a solo says this we've i've talked about

4109.04 --> 4113.44
it and the flat earth on the flat earth

4110.88 --> 4116.4400000000005
debate we talked about it for like three

4113.44 --> 4116.44
years

4118.239 --> 4120.718999999999
come on

4125.09 --> 4130.159000000001
[Music]

4128.0 --> 4132.08
i see me morris more phys centered in

4130.159 --> 4133.599999999999
the physical plane yeah philosophically

4132.08 --> 4136.4
as well because

4133.6 --> 4139.04
yeah matt never responded to that little

4136.4 --> 4142.719
factoid i threw out yeah that little

4139.04 --> 4144.799
very very sharp extremely hard extremely

4142.719 --> 4146.96
rare black diamond chip

4144.799 --> 4149.679
that i found

4146.96 --> 4149.679
which is

4150.08 --> 4153.5199999999995
everything

4151.92 --> 4156.0
we see

4153.52 --> 4157.92
in the dream world in our spiritual

4156.0 --> 4160.159
experience on the other side no matter

4157.92 --> 4163.12
how induced whether naturally or through

4160.159 --> 4165.599999999999
drugs or through trauma doesn't matter

4163.12 --> 4168.0
all of those things we see on the other

4165.6 --> 4168.88
side are all based

4168.0 --> 4169.96
on

4168.88 --> 4174.2390000000005
physical

4169.96 --> 4177.52
observations physical sensory input

4174.239 --> 4180.159
which there can only be one logical

4177.52 --> 4182.719
consistent conclusion to be drawn from

4180.159 --> 4184.5599999999995
and that is that the physical plane is

4182.719 --> 4186.88
primary

4184.56 --> 4191.4400000000005
and there's nothing

4186.88 --> 4194.08
anyone or anything can do about that

4191.44 --> 4196.879999999999
no matter how important our spiritual

4194.08 --> 4200.4
experiences are to us

4196.88 --> 4203.1990000000005
and to our purpose being here

4200.4 --> 4205.28
what we actually experience outside of

4203.199 --> 4208.0
physical reality

4205.28 --> 4211.36
our physical linear time-bound reality

4208.0 --> 4211.36
is all based

4213.04 --> 4219.44
on physical reality experiences every

4216.48 --> 4220.4
conception we have in our dreams is all

4219.44 --> 4223.28
based

4220.4 --> 4224.879999999999
on physical

4223.28 --> 4226.96
experiences

4224.88 --> 4229.679
there's no way

4226.96 --> 4230.88
out of that like not even our mystical

4229.679 --> 4232.88
experiences

4230.88 --> 4236.4800000000005
get a get a pass on this

4232.88 --> 4238.56
because they're also based on actual

4236.48 --> 4240.5599999999995
feelings that we experience in the

4238.56 --> 4241.679
physical world

4240.56 --> 4244.400000000001
that are

4241.679 --> 4246.4800000000005
a combination of like our hormones and

4244.4 --> 4248.879999999999
our organs and euphoria all kinds of

4246.48 --> 4251.759999999999
things that can give us excellent

4248.88 --> 4253.52
amazing experiences be extremely

4251.76 --> 4256.08
motivating be

4253.52 --> 4257.52
destroyers of fear no matter what it is

4256.08 --> 4259.6
right incredible

4257.52 --> 4261.92
but it is physical

4259.6 --> 4265.360000000001
so even those experiences

4261.92 --> 4267.84
you might sense that in the other side

4265.36 --> 4270.4
it's still based on physically

4267.84 --> 4273.360000000001
experienced senses

4270.4 --> 4276.48
all of it is and that's why the physical

4273.36 --> 4276.48
plane is primary

4278.08 --> 4281.6
for our very being

4282.48 --> 4287.919999999999
and that is probably part of the

4285.84 --> 4291.28
i mean if it wasn't then what the hell

4287.92 --> 4291.28
would we even be doing here

4291.76 --> 4296.1990000000005
then there's no purpose for our

4293.199 --> 4296.199
development

4303.76 --> 4307.360000000001
there is nothing about your awareness

4305.36 --> 4308.639999999999
that is physical that's not what i said

4307.36 --> 4311.28
though

4308.64 --> 4313.52
not talking about the awareness itself

4311.28 --> 4318.159
i'm talking about our perceptions the

4313.52 --> 4318.159000000001
things that we see hear feel smell

4319.92 --> 4327.1990000000005
including in our dreams and our visions

4324.239 --> 4329.199
and our surreal experiences all of that

4327.199 --> 4330.0
is all based

4329.199 --> 4332.5599999999995
on

4330.0 --> 4334.96
physical experiences

4332.56 --> 4337.4400000000005
does it matter

4334.96 --> 4339.92
that you can strawman me with saying the

4337.44 --> 4341.759999999999
awareness itself is not physical

4339.92 --> 4343.679
i'm not saying it is

4341.76 --> 4346.719
the awareness is

4343.679 --> 4349.1990000000005
like a little fragment of god

4346.719 --> 4351.679
it is a spirit it is separate it is a

4349.199 --> 4353.44
consciousness it is not physical and it

4351.679 --> 4357.12
transcends the physical in the sense

4353.44 --> 4359.04
that we can bypass the physical

4357.12 --> 4363.28
but all

4359.04 --> 4366.8
are hopes and dreams and visions

4363.28 --> 4368.08
and our longings are all based on

4366.8 --> 4369.6
physical

4368.08 --> 4371.12
interactions

4369.6 --> 4373.76
and physical

4371.12 --> 4373.76
perception

4373.89 --> 4377.4400000000005
[Music]

4375.28 --> 4379.36
never the other way around because that

4377.44 --> 4380.719
can't

4379.36 --> 4382.88
if you're going to experience something

4380.719 --> 4385.52
in spiritual that is inexperienceable

4382.88 --> 4388.88
then you cannot translate it

4385.52 --> 4388.88
you couldn't explain it

4389.84 --> 4392.88
now there might be some of those

4391.199 --> 4394.239
experiences left

4392.88 --> 4396.32
out there

4394.239 --> 4398.879999999999
but you could never translate it you can

4396.32 --> 4402.5599999999995
only ever communicate and translate

4398.88 --> 4405.1990000000005
things and experiences through language

4402.56 --> 4407.6
which is grounded upon physical

4405.199 --> 4411.239
interaction

4407.6 --> 4411.2390000000005
so yeah

4413.07 --> 4419.36
[Music]

4415.52 --> 4420.2390000000005
do i agree with that theory oh you mean

4419.36 --> 4424.32
the

4420.239 --> 4427.839999999999
unavoidable fact that i've unrouted

4424.32 --> 4427.84
like a year ago

4428.0 --> 4431.76
that you would hey i'd love you to argue

4430.719 --> 4434.8
with me

4431.76 --> 4437.4400000000005
anybody no matter how smart you are and

4434.8 --> 4439.12
i mean like i i freaking argue with this

4437.44 --> 4440.5599999999995
with the dalai lama

4439.12 --> 4443.12
if necessary

4440.56 --> 4446.0
i'm very confident about what i'm saying

4443.12 --> 4447.199
right here because it is demonstrably

4446.0 --> 4449.44
true

4447.199 --> 4452.159
it is so demonstrably true

4449.44 --> 4454.719
that there is not even an option to

4452.159 --> 4456.5599999999995
prove the contrary this is like a gas

4454.719 --> 4457.84
pressure without a container type

4456.56 --> 4459.92
scenario

4457.84 --> 4463.04
that i've unleashed

4459.92 --> 4463.04
with that revelation

4465.44 --> 4469.599999999999
physical plainness temporary yeah could

4467.199 --> 4472.4
be does that matter

4469.6 --> 4475.360000000001
does that matter to our experiences all

4472.4 --> 4478.32
being rooted in

4475.36 --> 4480.5599999999995
things that come from physical

4478.32 --> 4483.12
interaction

4480.56 --> 4486.2390000000005
all our dreams all our visions are all

4483.12 --> 4489.64
based on the material interaction that

4486.239 --> 4491.599999999999
we've experienced or maybe even

4489.64 --> 4493.679
pre-experienced that others have

4491.6 --> 4496.08
experienced that other people in the

4493.679 --> 4498.159
realm before you have experienced and

4496.08 --> 4499.5199999999995
you might assimilate their experience

4498.159 --> 4502.159
that are still based on physical

4499.52 --> 4503.52
interactions

4502.159 --> 4505.92
yeah

4503.52 --> 4508.4800000000005
that's my point

4505.92 --> 4510.4
antecedent

4508.48 --> 4513.919999999999
for experience

4510.4 --> 4516.4
and visual for sensory experience

4513.92 --> 4518.4800000000005
is physical interaction that's where it

4516.4 --> 4521.759999999999
all comes from that's what our dreams

4518.48 --> 4525.5199999999995
are comprised of reflections of our

4521.76 --> 4527.92
experience with physical interaction

4525.52 --> 4529.92
and yeah the laws of the physical might

4527.92 --> 4534.96
not apply

4529.92 --> 4534.96
but it's still going to be based on it

4537.04 --> 4542.0
yeah so hey mr sandman

4540.239 --> 4543.919999999999
yeah you can think

4542.0 --> 4546.719
that the dream world is primary it's

4543.92 --> 4548.08
your realm yeah yeah but you don't

4546.719 --> 4550.88
realize that

4548.08 --> 4553.6
everything that is shown and everything

4550.88 --> 4556.64
that is seen and felt and

4553.6 --> 4557.6
is all based

4556.64 --> 4564.04
on

4557.6 --> 4564.04
experiences in the physical world

4564.31 --> 4567.369000000001
[Music]

4568.8 --> 4576.92
whether that is temporary or not is not

4571.28 --> 4576.92
relevant to the demonstrable reality

4581.03 --> 4584.13
[Music]

4588.0 --> 4590.56
that's right

4590.8 --> 4593.679
solipsism

4594.96 --> 4597.6
that's not

4596.08 --> 4599.92
a word

4597.6 --> 4601.84
but no i'm not solipsist i'm just

4599.92 --> 4604.2390000000005
literally

4601.84 --> 4606.4800000000005
being mechanical here i'm being like

4604.239 --> 4608.4
monstrously accurate

4606.48 --> 4610.48
about my perception

4608.4 --> 4613.199
and not letting any

4610.48 --> 4615.5199999999995
personal experience get in the way of my

4613.199 --> 4618.32
reasoning you see because that would be

4615.52 --> 4620.96
a sign of fatigue and where fatigue

4618.32 --> 4624.0
comes chaos takes over and i do not

4620.96 --> 4626.88
allow that i will see it even if that

4624.0 --> 4628.96
means i will not feel like a human being

4626.88 --> 4630.88
to do that

4628.96 --> 4633.92
because i will see it i will see it as

4630.88 --> 4635.52
it is even if i don't like what i see i

4633.92 --> 4639.52
will see it

4635.52 --> 4639.52
because i want to see what is real

4640.32 --> 4644.159
and that's not solipsistic a soul

4642.48 --> 4647.759999999999
obsessed

4644.159 --> 4651.199
thinks that nothing really exists

4647.76 --> 4654.159000000001
thinks that it's all just in your mind

4651.199 --> 4656.5599999999995
that's a solipsist yeah matt from

4654.159 --> 4658.08
quantum of conscious seems to be kind of

4656.56 --> 4659.92
a solipsist

4658.08 --> 4662.96
because he always goes yeah everything

4659.92 --> 4665.76
is fake it just he does he says it

4662.96 --> 4668.2390000000005
occasionally like every show

4665.76 --> 4669.76
he's effectively a solipsist by his own

4668.239 --> 4673.199
declarations

4669.76 --> 4674.08
now whether that is a story he is going

4673.199 --> 4675.839999999999
with

4674.08 --> 4678.32
or whether he that fundamentally

4675.84 --> 4680.8
believes that i don't know but

4678.32 --> 4681.92
everything he says

4680.8 --> 4686.08
gives me

4681.92 --> 4688.159
an indication that he is moving towards

4686.08 --> 4690.84
solipsism

4688.159 --> 4694.08
and yeah that's his own freaking problem

4690.84 --> 4697.1990000000005
bro it's your [ __ ] life you want to

4694.08 --> 4698.719
be a solopsist go ahead that makes you

4697.199 --> 4702.5199999999995
happy

4698.719 --> 4702.52
i'm not gonna do that

4708.239 --> 4712.159
a dream is never just a dream yeah but

4710.0 --> 4714.32
i'm not talking about the esoterics of a

4712.159 --> 4716.799999999999
dream as to why do you have that dream

4714.32 --> 4718.12
what does it mean i'm talking about the

4716.8 --> 4721.76
very

4718.12 --> 4725.28
substance the material virtual or

4721.76 --> 4727.92
otherwise the substance of a dream

4725.28 --> 4731.04
what do we perceive the images the

4727.92 --> 4733.6
visuals the hearing the smells

4731.04 --> 4736.08
the associations

4733.6 --> 4738.8
memories where memories come from yeah

4736.08 --> 4742.0
that's being generated

4738.8 --> 4744.64
while you're physically interacting

4742.0 --> 4746.719
yeah so it's all based on physical

4744.64 --> 4749.360000000001
interaction that is

4746.719 --> 4752.56
what i'm saying i'm not talking about

4749.36 --> 4753.839999999999
the esoterics of a dream that you may

4752.56 --> 4756.4800000000005
have

4753.84 --> 4758.2390000000005
right you have dreams for a reason

4756.48 --> 4760.4
that's that would be talking about

4758.239 --> 4763.28
esoteric now i'm talking about the very

4760.4 --> 4765.44
fabric of it

4763.28 --> 4768.159
where did it come from how does it

4765.44 --> 4772.0
manifest what is it based upon

4768.159 --> 4775.759999999999
it's based upon physical interaction

4772.0 --> 4776.96
with the material timeline bound

4775.76 --> 4779.12
realm

4776.96 --> 4781.04
that's where it's all derived from

4779.12 --> 4783.679
that's where it's all based on that what

4781.04 --> 4786.4
we see that we hear

4783.679 --> 4789.4
it wouldn't mean anything to us if it

4786.4 --> 4789.4
wasn't

4791.3 --> 4795.93
[Music]

4802.48 --> 4808.08
dust and moon moonbeams yeah but fairies

4806.0 --> 4810.4
very dust and moonbeams

4808.08 --> 4811.48
yeah you know what those are

4810.4 --> 4814.96
those are

4811.48 --> 4817.599999999999
fantastical encapsulations

4814.96 --> 4820.08
of physical interaction-based

4817.6 --> 4822.96
experiences

4820.08 --> 4822.96
yes they are

4823.12 --> 4825.92
yeah

4824.32 --> 4828.159
i mean

4825.92 --> 4829.1990000000005
it wouldn't be hard for me to imagine

4828.159 --> 4831.04
how

4829.199 --> 4833.28
a little kid

4831.04 --> 4835.28
could see a bug

4833.28 --> 4837.36
that like a

4835.28 --> 4839.36
let's just say

4837.36 --> 4841.12
a dragonfly and they'd never seen a

4839.36 --> 4843.199
dragonfly before and parents are not

4841.12 --> 4845.5199999999995
around at that moment

4843.199 --> 4847.12
and the dragonfly is sitting

4845.52 --> 4847.92
on a flower

4847.12 --> 4851.199
like

4847.92 --> 4852.639
right there above the kit okay it's like

4851.199 --> 4855.04
and then

4852.639 --> 4858.0
the dragonfly suddenly jumps up because

4855.04 --> 4862.0
it's startled and because it jumps up

4858.0 --> 4863.44
the flower shakes and then dust

4862.0 --> 4866.32
right the

4863.44 --> 4867.44
the pollen goes right into the kid's

4866.32 --> 4869.759999999999
face

4867.44 --> 4872.719
and they go

4869.76 --> 4876.400000000001
right yeah that's now that's

4872.719 --> 4877.84
in the memory it's not unlikely

4876.4 --> 4880.879999999999
really it isn't

4877.84 --> 4884.08
that through the mandela like effect the

4880.88 --> 4886.32
kid might actually later remember it as

4884.08 --> 4888.639
if they encountered a fairy

4886.32 --> 4890.88
that was startled and then

4888.639 --> 4893.12
poofed a little dust

4890.88 --> 4895.36
in their face and to get away

4893.12 --> 4897.12
see that's what the mind makes of it

4895.36 --> 4898.799999999999
when you're very young

4897.12 --> 4901.5199999999995
right and then

4898.8 --> 4903.84
it's visually reinforced with cartoons

4901.52 --> 4906.56
and all that but that is how these types

4903.84 --> 4908.76
of experiences and surreal things come

4906.56 --> 4910.88
into being

4908.76 --> 4912.639
misinterpretation of physical real

4910.88 --> 4914.84
things and then they start to form their

4912.639 --> 4919.4400000000005
own life and they might even

4914.84 --> 4923.360000000001
attain a spirit on its own a construct

4919.44 --> 4925.599999999999
like a dream construct or

4923.36 --> 4930.32
like a known entity that might actually

4925.6 --> 4931.76
start to like claim the form

4930.32 --> 4934.719
and basically

4931.76 --> 4936.400000000001
yeah slip into your dreams

4934.719 --> 4938.2390000000005
through it

4936.4 --> 4939.599999999999
this is sounding very freddy krueger

4938.239 --> 4942.32
like that but

4939.6 --> 4944.96
yeah i dude i study this stuff all the

4942.32 --> 4946.88
time so the movie like or the series

4944.96 --> 4948.2390000000005
like sandman

4946.88 --> 4950.88
that's like

4948.239 --> 4952.638999999999
like yeah

4950.88 --> 4954.8
it's freaking gay

4952.639 --> 4955.6
thank god that it's not like that in my

4954.8 --> 4956.719
head

4955.6 --> 4959.04
ugh

4956.719 --> 4961.92
but

4959.04 --> 4964.56
just the mechanics and i have been

4961.92 --> 4967.52
dealing with this for a while i mean i i

4964.56 --> 4969.76
literally say i do i dream walk

4967.52 --> 4971.360000000001
how long have i been saying i dream walk

4969.76 --> 4973.1990000000005
guys

4971.36 --> 4975.92
for at least two years i've been saying

4973.199 --> 4977.5199999999995
yeah i do dreamwalking it it may seem

4975.92 --> 4979.84
like it's complete waste of time but it

4977.52 --> 4981.76
isn't i'm actually doing something like

4979.84 --> 4984.2390000000005
extra dimensional when i do that and it

4981.76 --> 4986.719
works it's been working and will keep

4984.239 --> 4986.718999999999
working

4989.52 --> 4993.76
i'm pretty sure i was saying that way

4992.639 --> 4997.96
before

4993.76 --> 4997.96
sandman came out

5004.56 --> 5008.639
because i understand dreams

5006.8 --> 5010.8
a lot

5008.639 --> 5013.1990000000005
it's like one of my things

5010.8 --> 5015.1990000000005
i am a dreamer it's one of the first

5013.199 --> 5016.5599999999995
things i was tasked

5015.199 --> 5019.28
tasked

5016.56 --> 5020.96
by my parents like

5019.28 --> 5022.719
you have this talent

5020.96 --> 5027.2390000000005
don't give it up

5022.719 --> 5027.2390000000005
i was warned not to give it up

5031.199 --> 5036.719
exercise in your sleep are we ingenious

5034.32 --> 5036.719
and what

5039.04 --> 5043.76
what are you talking about dominoid

5040.56 --> 5046.080000000001
comics from the 90s

5043.76 --> 5048.400000000001
you realize i don't actually read comics

5046.08 --> 5050.32
right the only reason i know anything

5048.4 --> 5052.879999999999
about comics is because of comic

5050.32 --> 5055.5199999999995
reviewer that was on a

5052.88 --> 5057.84
reviewer website group that i've been

5055.52 --> 5057.84
following

5058.719 --> 5063.28
who used to review like all these comics

5060.8 --> 5065.360000000001
and explain about it was like this comic

5063.28 --> 5069.96
nerd guy and i

5065.36 --> 5069.96
happened to learn some about it

5070.639 --> 5075.36
i've never actually just like walked

5072.96 --> 5076.96
into a comic book store and got my own

5075.36 --> 5078.96
comics no

5076.96 --> 5083.08
i'm not a comic guy at all

5078.96 --> 5083.08
i'm a computer game guy

5089.679 --> 5093.679
you never dream because you smoke weed

5091.6 --> 5095.76
that is really weird geoshifter because

5093.679 --> 5097.4400000000005
i smoke weed and i'm sure as hell

5095.76 --> 5100.2390000000005
dreaming

5097.44 --> 5102.96
good dreams by the way no nightmares

5100.239 --> 5104.879999999999
very constructive dreams i actually

5102.96 --> 5108.32
i think i might have migrated in my

5104.88 --> 5110.2390000000005
dream world into mechanics

5108.32 --> 5112.32
that sounds really weird right what is

5110.239 --> 5113.379999999999
that mechanism well they haven't even

5112.32 --> 5115.759999999999
addressed that in

5113.38 --> 5118.32
[Music]

5115.76 --> 5121.280000000001
in the sandman yeah

5118.32 --> 5122.719
because it's based on dnd and i don't

5121.28 --> 5125.28
know if they're going to do that but

5122.719 --> 5127.52
mechanics

5125.28 --> 5131.199
if you would see it you'd probably think

5127.52 --> 5131.1990000000005
of doctor strange

5131.92 --> 5137.36
which is the play yeah doctor strange

5134.32 --> 5138.88
has a lot of mechanics type

5137.36 --> 5141.679
virtual experience in the other

5138.88 --> 5144.4800000000005
dimension so the mirror dimension might

5141.679 --> 5146.4
be slightly mechanism but mechanics is

5144.48 --> 5147.36
basically a

5146.4 --> 5148.799999999999
an

5147.36 --> 5151.04
outer plane

5148.8 --> 5153.84
an other dimension

5151.04 --> 5155.92
that is specifically about border and

5153.84 --> 5160.2390000000005
mechanisms

5155.92 --> 5160.2390000000005
and it is like a constantly changing

5160.88 --> 5167.04
place where everything is like gears

5163.52 --> 5169.84
it's like a giant clockwork dimension

5167.04 --> 5169.84
fascinating place

5170.32 --> 5175.599999999999
but i think i'm dreaming in the canvas i

5172.88 --> 5177.28
really do because it just seems like

5175.6 --> 5179.76
that now in my dreams it's like

5177.28 --> 5182.159
constantly like things

5179.76 --> 5183.4400000000005
moving and things forming and it's just

5182.159 --> 5185.679
like what

5183.44 --> 5187.678999999999
so fast

5185.679 --> 5190.159
it's like i'm in this

5187.679 --> 5191.92
weird virtual thing

5190.159 --> 5194.5599999999995
in my dreams oh look now so here's

5191.92 --> 5194.56
mechanism

5195.12 --> 5199.92
that is it

5197.36 --> 5202.96
it's not much of a picture but

5199.92 --> 5202.96
it is mechanism

5203.12 --> 5207.5199999999995
all right do you see anything about that

5206.32 --> 5210.3099999999995
yeah

5207.52 --> 5214.8
it's basically the gear dimension and

5210.31 --> 5214.8
[Music]

5215.12 --> 5219.84
i rarely remember well i don't remember

5217.199 --> 5224.599999999999
any contacts i just remember the virtual

5219.84 --> 5224.6
landscape that's what i remember now

5224.719 --> 5229.44
it's just how everything worked is what

5227.04 --> 5230.48
i remember now not what i was doing

5229.44 --> 5234.48
there

5230.48 --> 5234.48
seems overall very irrelevant

5235.04 --> 5240.239
or irrelevant to my waking consciousness

5238.08 --> 5242.159
it seems very important what i'm doing i

5240.239 --> 5243.919999999999
think i might be like mastering the

5242.159 --> 5246.879999999999
dimension

5243.92 --> 5249.12
like literally trying to i don't know

5246.88 --> 5251.679
take over mechanics if that's even a

5249.12 --> 5254.8
real place

5251.679 --> 5254.8
it it feels like it

5255.199 --> 5261.12
it kind of sounds like what some dmt is

5257.76 --> 5261.12
described yeah could be

5264.08 --> 5268.0
well i have a lot of dmt in my system

5266.159 --> 5269.5199999999995
naturally because my pineal gland is

5268.0 --> 5271.679
just big

5269.52 --> 5271.679
so

5276.08 --> 5281.5199999999995
but it seems like i'm just

5278.08 --> 5284.5599999999995
i've taken up residence there

5281.52 --> 5288.639
in my dreams and i am building stuff i

5284.56 --> 5290.400000000001
am like mastering transmutation

5288.639 --> 5292.96
in there

5290.4 --> 5295.36
i'm literally doing magic [ __ ] i'm doing

5292.96 --> 5297.92
like dungeons and dragons like magic

5295.36 --> 5297.92
[ __ ] like

5298.0 --> 5304.719
turning objects into other objects

5301.52 --> 5307.679
or transforming one metal into another

5304.719 --> 5310.2390000000005
it's weird what i'm doing in my dreams

5307.679 --> 5310.2390000000005
these days

5310.96 --> 5315.84
machine elf [ __ ] always shifting yeah

5320.32 --> 5324.239
although

5321.199 --> 5327.36
yeah the machine ls and all that the

5324.239 --> 5330.4
leprechauns that is like a

5327.36 --> 5331.679
in between state i mean people usually

5330.4 --> 5335.04
see them

5331.679 --> 5337.92
overlaying the physical real world right

5335.04 --> 5340.08
so it's like oh i'm seeing a a row of

5337.92 --> 5341.84
leprechauns walking

5340.08 --> 5344.8
through the room or something right that

5341.84 --> 5346.719
would be a typical sighting

5344.8 --> 5347.52
the clockwork elves

5346.719 --> 5349.76
well

5347.52 --> 5352.639
what my experience is is literally in

5349.76 --> 5355.04
another dimension it's not here

5352.639 --> 5357.6
it's not any familiar place everything

5355.04 --> 5359.6
is fluid i don't even stand on ground

5357.6 --> 5362.2390000000005
it's just there's material things

5359.6 --> 5364.2390000000005
everywhere in shapes

5362.239 --> 5366.718999999999
but it's constantly like moving around

5364.239 --> 5368.638999999999
so i'm like standing there i'm seeing

5366.719 --> 5370.159
this location where i'm doing something

5368.639 --> 5372.4800000000005
with my hands in the meantime in the

5370.159 --> 5376.96
background i'm just seeing like

5372.48 --> 5379.599999999999
giant beams of like metal or wood just

5376.96 --> 5381.44
shooting by

5379.6 --> 5383.679
and i don't even know if that's me doing

5381.44 --> 5384.799999999999
that it seems like it's not and i'm just

5383.679 --> 5386.719
doing

5384.8 --> 5390.28
something trying to transmute this is

5386.719 --> 5390.28
happening a lot

5396.56 --> 5398.96
and

5400.8 --> 5405.6
i think i also like even

5403.28 --> 5407.759999999999
have like weird

5405.6 --> 5408.96
gnomes there or something they're not

5407.76 --> 5410.639
like

5408.96 --> 5412.32
little leprechauns they're not like tiny

5410.639 --> 5415.12
they're like

5412.32 --> 5417.44
this big like smaller than me

5415.12 --> 5420.5599999999995
and they're like

5417.44 --> 5422.32
engineer gnomes or something they're

5420.56 --> 5425.76
there too

5422.32 --> 5425.759999999999
my dreams are so weird

5430.239 --> 5435.839999999999
right but it's not the typical clockwork

5432.48 --> 5435.839999999999
gnome descriptions though

5436.08 --> 5441.36
they are engineers oh yes they are dude

5438.88 --> 5442.159000000001
they have like the tools they have like

5441.36 --> 5443.04
a

5442.159 --> 5444.879999999999
like

5443.04 --> 5445.6
what is it

5444.88 --> 5448.08
they're

5445.6 --> 5450.2390000000005
like these little pouches with all these

5448.08 --> 5452.08
tools pens and

5450.239 --> 5454.5599999999995
and rulers and

5452.08 --> 5458.719
plumb bobs and dude they got they are

5454.56 --> 5458.719
engineers those gnomes they are

5459.12 --> 5465.04
the world of warcraft has such gnomes oh

5462.239 --> 5465.04
that's hilarious

5465.199 --> 5470.5599999999995
well yeah

5466.88 --> 5472.8
a little bound to have that created i'm

5470.56 --> 5472.8
look

5473.28 --> 5479.599999999999
[Music]

5475.6 --> 5481.679
i i don't play world of warcraft

5479.6 --> 5485.52
it didn't seem like world of warcraft

5481.679 --> 5485.52
this seems like another dimension

5485.92 --> 5490.96
and i don't really even do anything with

5489.199 --> 5491.839999999999
those gnomes they're doing their own

5490.96 --> 5495.04
thing

5491.84 --> 5496.400000000001
dude i i might be a gnome

5495.04 --> 5498.4
there

5496.4 --> 5501.28
to be fair i've never even like in that

5498.4 --> 5503.679
dimension looked in a mirror or anything

5501.28 --> 5506.639
my hands seemed the same

5503.679 --> 5508.88
so i don't know what i am there

5506.639 --> 5511.36
i do look through my own eyes never like

5508.88 --> 5512.639
third few for per third-person view or

5511.36 --> 5515.04
anything

5512.639 --> 5517.28
that can happen by the way i can't do

5515.04 --> 5519.36
that in my dream state

5517.28 --> 5521.04
literally i can just

5519.36 --> 5523.599999999999
go about

5521.04 --> 5525.5199999999995
usually it would be some kind of nerve

5523.6 --> 5528.159000000001
related situation but then i can just

5525.52 --> 5529.4400000000005
like zoom out and just watch myself from

5528.159 --> 5533.48
the back

5529.44 --> 5533.48
i can do that in my dream

5541.679 --> 5547.84
have you seen the silver lady

5544.56 --> 5547.84
yeah i think i have

5551.84 --> 5555.679
that's funny that you mentioned that

5553.52 --> 5557.92
does she look somewhat like

5555.679 --> 5559.84
that ancient movie

5557.92 --> 5562.4
that very old movie where they had like

5559.84 --> 5565.679
the robot girl in there

5562.4 --> 5565.679
it looked kind of like that

5566.159 --> 5572.239
or like c tripio or something

5569.84 --> 5575.12
or more like uh what is it

5572.239 --> 5577.839999999999
