[Music]

95.46 --> 99.83999999999999
the weather today is great

98.13 --> 101.82
[Music]

99.84 --> 107.36
it's been really stormy yesterday

101.82 --> 107.36
evening at night like actual lightning

108.24 --> 113.899
especially a little over to the South

110.159 --> 113.899
this is continually

114.36 --> 121.68
didn't really get super close though

117.72 --> 126.979
but still close enough to see but yeah

121.68 --> 126.97900000000001
now it's a little less heavy clouded

127.92 --> 135.36
plenty of wind

129.959 --> 137.52
and plenty of Blue Sky all those Trails

135.36 --> 139.14000000000001
yet left yesterday would are definitely

137.52 --> 143.48000000000002
washed out

139.14 --> 143.48
it's all nice clear blue again

144.239 --> 151.52
in between the clouds

146.76 --> 151.51999999999998
and yeah plants definitely enjoying that

152.16 --> 156.85999999999999
everything is still very green around

154.5 --> 156.86
here

161.4 --> 165.5
my plants are doing fine

168.42 --> 172.55999999999997
especially the parsley I mean that just

170.879 --> 173.38
keeps going

172.56 --> 174.84
to go

173.38 --> 179.64
[Music]

174.84 --> 181.86
bees making a visit to the bloomings

179.64 --> 183.66
regularly they really like it and I

181.86 --> 186.54000000000002
really like that they like it

183.66 --> 188.64
so it's almost like maybe I like to

186.54 --> 190.07999999999998
Basil more to just leave them growing

188.64 --> 193.14
like they're a

190.08 --> 195.239
they're a wild herb because there's so

193.14 --> 198.98
many little

195.239 --> 198.98000000000002
bees and all that coming for it

199.319 --> 203.819
that makes it worth it on its own anyway

201.78 --> 206.159
a little more colored first in chat

203.819 --> 210.42
Moxie Richard G

206.159 --> 216.42
ere 306 good to see you all

210.42 --> 219.23899999999998
it is Wednesday the 12th of July 2023

216.42 --> 222.42
I got it right in one go

219.239 --> 224.519
as far as that even considered it a

222.42 --> 226.14
technical pronunciation in English I've

224.519 --> 228.239
never heard anymore

226.14 --> 231.659
American or English person actually

228.239 --> 233.81900000000002
attempt to pronounce it like that

231.659 --> 236.28
sometimes I think that they actually

233.819 --> 239.06
reversed

236.28 --> 239.06
the date

240.0 --> 244.4
that they do the month first and then

242.76 --> 251.35999999999999
the number

244.4 --> 254.64000000000001
just to avoid ever having to say 12

251.36 --> 257.639
because it is almost completely

254.64 --> 261.479
unpronounceable

257.639 --> 264.199
but I keep trying it anyway every month

261.479 --> 264.199
uh

266.22 --> 271.94000000000005
terrible polluted air oh that's sorry to

268.919 --> 271.94
hear that Mark Allard

276.9 --> 281.82
right so yeah the cabinet Falls still

279.419 --> 284.82
undergoing here

281.82 --> 287.21999999999997
and there's all these things

284.82 --> 290.759
there's basically like a big relief

287.22 --> 294.54
going around because well there were so

290.759 --> 296.36
many [ __ ] up things in the waiting row

294.54 --> 300.97900000000004
to be

296.36 --> 300.97900000000004
initiated by the cartel party here

301.5 --> 310.32
and like yeah but I mean I I knew that

305.6 --> 312.47900000000004
it was why I was making a lot of urgency

310.32 --> 316.94
and I did say like yeah it's gonna be

312.479 --> 316.94
over this year like and it is

317.46 --> 324.78
and it's saving us like and just

321.62 --> 326.28000000000003
insurmountable amount of detriments that

324.78 --> 328.61999999999995
we would have gotten piled on we would

326.28 --> 332.63899999999995
have never been able to get out of it

328.62 --> 334.68
would become a broken State and there's

332.639 --> 336.0
a chance to get out of that

334.68 --> 337.5
now

336.0 --> 342.419
but

337.5 --> 346.02
this to use the Dr Shiva vernacular this

342.419 --> 348.06
is the time where for us where a not so

346.02 --> 351.539
obvious establishment

348.06 --> 355.139
trying to take it over is at the maximum

351.539 --> 357.65999999999997
risk because yeah they are they don't

355.139 --> 358.8
like making a habit of letting go of

357.66 --> 361.08000000000004
power

358.8 --> 364.08
you see and but they tried that with the

361.08 --> 366.35999999999996
BBB party

364.08 --> 370.21999999999997
but they already came out they came out

366.36 --> 374.759
of the Shadows for being wef supporting

370.22 --> 377.759
agenda supporting party so

374.759 --> 379.68
they don't have that secret

377.759 --> 382.319
move anymore

379.68 --> 383.94
so they're gonna try it because they

382.319 --> 385.56
can't help themselves and they don't

383.94 --> 388.08
feel like they have anything to hold

385.56 --> 390.419
them back in trying so they're gonna try

388.08 --> 391.8
to roll out new groups that are gonna

390.419 --> 394.85999999999996
pop out of nowhere they're gonna say

391.8 --> 397.979
exactly the right thing and then

394.86 --> 400.319
betray everybody in the last moment and

397.979 --> 403.09999999999997
make it happen all over again that's the

400.319 --> 403.1
biggest risk now

403.44 --> 408.84
but

404.639 --> 411.479
it's still in its sprouting stage so

408.84 --> 413.94
at least we have some time to take a

411.479 --> 416.88
breather and recover a bit from just the

413.94 --> 418.74
stress of what was happening

416.88 --> 420.419
but it doesn't mean it's permanently

418.74 --> 422.88
over

420.419 --> 425.4
the Dutch people have to be more alert

422.88 --> 427.5
than ever but I I mean it's kind of

425.4 --> 430.31899999999996
funny you might not understand because

427.5 --> 432.36
you're not Dutch to say the Dutch hook

430.319 --> 435.199
no have to be more alert than ever is

432.36 --> 435.199
almost like

435.9 --> 442.919
a silly thing to say because once Dutch

439.919 --> 445.919
people wake up and get momentum

442.919 --> 447.71999999999997
you can't [ __ ] fool them again

445.919 --> 449.69899999999996
like

447.72 --> 453.06
you'll have to wait like an entire

449.699 --> 456.3
generation before you could even

453.06 --> 458.94
think of trying to fool them again it's

456.3 --> 461.94
not gonna happen so

458.94 --> 463.8
we won this round

461.94 --> 465.36
but they're still gonna try to worm

463.8 --> 467.58
their way back

465.36 --> 469.91900000000004
because they don't care if if they're

467.58 --> 474.06
not popular they just want that power

469.919 --> 477.29999999999995
and they'll try to trick everybody into

474.06 --> 479.46
giving him that position back

477.3 --> 483.38
so that's still ongoing

479.46 --> 483.38
exciting and hopeful

486.419 --> 488.9
anyway

492.72 --> 499.86
in the meantime like

495.599 --> 502.44
the sound of Freedom movie is like going

499.86 --> 506.819
around and

502.44 --> 508.379
being yeah having it a typical influence

506.819 --> 510.36
and our own Benjamin had some really

508.379 --> 512.7
interesting things to say about that on

510.36 --> 514.919
the stream yesterday

512.7 --> 518.24
it's a very early stream too by the way

514.919 --> 518.24
I don't know what but anyway

520.57 --> 523.599
[Music]

524.339 --> 530.6400000000001
because the actor in that movie is a

528.0 --> 534.12
really weird guy

530.64 --> 537.08
he's kind of creepy actually

534.12 --> 537.08
but yeah

537.48 --> 542.1
is just taking this role of being

539.82 --> 544.86
full-on hero basically and everybody

542.1 --> 549.98
loved in these pretty decently looking

544.86 --> 554.9590000000001
but I mean he's he's kind of a freak

549.98 --> 554.9590000000001
personality why like he's a weird guy

559.019 --> 565.2
and Owen is suspecting like some serious

562.14 --> 568.4399999999999
Wizardry playing out with this movie

565.2 --> 571.44
being rolled out

568.44 --> 573.12
and he has some good points there so I

571.44 --> 575.519
would check out Owen Benjamin stream

573.12 --> 578.9590000000001
from yesterday

575.519 --> 578.9590000000001
I do it through bit shoot

585.48 --> 588.32
this one

589.019 --> 591.14
thank you

591.5 --> 598.26
[Music]

594.48 --> 601.14
Robert De Niro has a Boston accent

598.26 --> 603.36
well I think he has it within his

601.14 --> 606.42
vernacular like what I don't think

603.36 --> 609.54
that's like his standard accent

606.42 --> 613.5799999999999
you gotta tear it this you got to

609.54 --> 613.5799999999999
realize this is like a Hollywood person

613.74 --> 618.3
they think they're above all that so

616.14 --> 621.38
they you and they usually are language

618.3 --> 621.38
capable so

622.14 --> 628.399
and Robert De Niro is not a very based

626.04 --> 628.399
guy

628.5 --> 633.6
so I doubt that he's gonna

630.839 --> 636.48
speak with a Boston accent

633.6 --> 638.76
in his own private time unless maybe he

636.48 --> 641.22
hung around with boss people from his

638.76 --> 644.36
old town or something but I don't know

641.22 --> 644.36
if he ever even does that

652.2 --> 657.38
anyway

653.66 --> 657.38
a weird question

662.79 --> 665.929
[Music]

670.76 --> 677.779
okay what

673.8 --> 677.779
wow Marcola that is

680.579 --> 683.3599999999999
what

687.06 --> 691.68
you got a serious Melting Pot going on

689.519 --> 692.94
with it within your accent then I guess

691.68 --> 695.54
more colored

692.94 --> 695.5400000000001
man

708.26 --> 713.42
you just love good fat yeah I'm sure you

711.24 --> 713.42
do

723.0 --> 728.899
people love when they're not used to

724.92 --> 728.899
well I mean

729.899 --> 737.12
there's like guys from fpd and all that

733.62 --> 739.68
with English accents

737.12 --> 741.36
that they are already really weird

739.68 --> 744.079
sounding so

741.36 --> 748.2
I doubt that your

744.079 --> 749.399
particular accent is gonna outweird the

748.2 --> 751.4590000000001
British guys

749.399 --> 754.68
more colored

751.459 --> 757.68
I really doubt it because they have some

754.68 --> 760.279
weird bowel twists

757.68 --> 760.279
huh

763.399 --> 770.279
Goodfellas is amazing really uh you're

766.8 --> 773.06
into Grappler history are you

770.279 --> 773.06
uh

779.339 --> 781.399
oh

781.44 --> 783.9200000000001
yeah

787.38 --> 791.66
some actually sound like me oh okay

795.06 --> 801.38
love the sound of my birds

797.399 --> 801.38
yeah that's a black bird

801.839 --> 807.44
beautiful isn't it they usually don't

804.36 --> 807.44
sing around this time

807.66 --> 812.54
I guess the weather's just so nice it

809.639 --> 812.54
just feels like it

817.5 --> 822.24
where is it

819.959 --> 824.399
I think it's like in one of the trees

822.24 --> 827.82
over there

824.399 --> 829.74
they usually go sit there and to sing

827.82 --> 833.1600000000001
which is Amazing by the way which

829.74 --> 836.5790000000001
because when I wake up in the morning

833.16 --> 839.6999999999999
they sit like right across of the Gap in

836.579 --> 841.9799999999999
my door right there in front of me

839.7 --> 845.0
singing so I get them straight to my

841.98 --> 845.0
face pretty much

847.56 --> 851.2399999999999
which is quite the experience

861.48 --> 867.3000000000001
anyway I hope you guys are doing okay

864.079 --> 869.6389999999999
I'm I'm doing fine

867.3 --> 872.76
yes the second half they had a lot of

869.639 --> 874.86
like cramps and [ __ ] like it gets pretty

872.76 --> 876.779
painful

874.86 --> 878.5790000000001
but I mean it's something that happens

876.779 --> 880.92
periodically I

878.579 --> 884.279
I never really I think it's like some

880.92 --> 886.92
metabolic thing or whatever

884.279 --> 889.399
lasts a few hours and then it just goes

886.92 --> 889.399
away again

893.639 --> 898.98
but yeah I feel a lot better today

896.279 --> 903.38
got I'm fully stocked

898.98 --> 903.38
with Illuminati Castle

904.68 --> 910.62
fresh rookula really fresh and good

907.8 --> 912.3
looking can't wait to Chow Down

910.62 --> 915.48
and of course

912.3 --> 918.9799999999999
Rudolph gusto

915.48 --> 918.98
and minty

937.74 --> 941.82
oh by the way what was funny yesterday

939.959 --> 945.42
is that

941.82 --> 948.48
Dr Shiva had a stream and I mean

945.42 --> 950.12
I've seen a lot of them now

948.48 --> 953.22
they're

950.12 --> 954.9590000000001
rich in information very consistent but

953.22 --> 958.9200000000001
it is a little repetitive but I mean

954.959 --> 961.92
it's logical he's literally a one-man

958.92 --> 964.4399999999999
yeah political campaigner

961.92 --> 967.4399999999999
so he is bound to repeat things over and

964.44 --> 969.62
over again to get those Core Concepts

967.44 --> 969.62
through

970.079 --> 976.019
but uh yeah he really does like read the

973.44 --> 977.82
chat and stuff and highlight things and

976.019 --> 981.0
like

977.82 --> 983.6990000000001
I made him laugh because I made a joke

981.0 --> 985.92
and it was kind of a nerdy joke and he

983.699 --> 988.8599999999999
really and he really actually thought it

985.92 --> 993.0
was funny and that was like I didn't

988.86 --> 995.5790000000001
expect him to actually laugh over that

993.0 --> 997.259
which was like well it gave me like a

995.579 --> 1000.68
serious interactive feeling like there's

997.259 --> 1003.1990000000001
not a guy in between

1000.68 --> 1006.3199999999999
doing his YouTube is really on the other

1003.199 --> 1008.68
side doing that it's that was pretty

1006.32 --> 1008.6800000000001
awesome

1008.779 --> 1015.4399999999999
I made because he was talking about how

1011.72 --> 1017.779
[ __ ] the [ __ ] that came out of sort yeah

1015.44 --> 1019.6990000000001
the not so obvious establishment figures

1017.779 --> 1021.38
and all that Howard's just

1019.699 --> 1023.959
useless and

1021.38 --> 1027.679
should be avoided

1023.959 --> 1030.579
and then I said like [ __ ] is useless

1027.679 --> 1032.8600000000001
unless you properly fermented

1030.579 --> 1036.1989999999998
and he thought that was funny and that

1032.86 --> 1038.54
you got to be a nerd to actually laugh

1036.199 --> 1040.4
over that and he did and that was pretty

1038.54 --> 1041.72
cool

1040.4 --> 1043.2800000000002
uh

1041.72 --> 1046.52
as a

1043.28 --> 1051.2
like a character test to me so he's he's

1046.52 --> 1053.48
he's he really is a nerd he's not like

1051.2 --> 1055.88
I'm a politician I'm really smart

1053.48 --> 1058.88
because I'm a nerd and I invent it no no

1055.88 --> 1062.5590000000002
he actually is a nerd and that's cool

1058.88 --> 1062.5590000000002
I'm he's awesome

1065.14 --> 1071.6000000000001
so I'm really looking in forward to see

1068.66 --> 1074.799
how Dr Shiva will be able to influence

1071.6 --> 1074.799
well the world

1074.96 --> 1081.7
more because he has great ideas

1079.16 --> 1085.539
is repotive

1081.7 --> 1085.539
is he repetitive

1091.1 --> 1095.12
oh here

1092.72 --> 1096.5
you emailed him ghetto

1095.12 --> 1100.1789999999999
that's cool

1096.5 --> 1100.179
I've never actually emailed him

1103.88 --> 1108.919
but I mean I'm in the chat and he

1106.22 --> 1114.559
highlights my comments and all that so

1108.919 --> 1117.94
like yeah he seems very forward which is

1114.559 --> 1117.94
kind of unusual

1118.16 --> 1124.3400000000001
for people that run for president

1121.179 --> 1127.64
because he's actually doing that

1124.34 --> 1129.74
but it's like ah man it does give me

1127.64 --> 1133.46
like a little

1129.74 --> 1136.0
flashy star feeling that like it is

1133.46 --> 1136.0
pretty awesome

1137.24 --> 1141.32
I'm just really curious as to how far

1139.46 --> 1144.08
you will be able to take it will he

1141.32 --> 1146.4189999999999
actually be able to get enough momentum

1144.08 --> 1148.82
with the people

1146.419 --> 1152.5
because if he's gonna like win it's

1148.82 --> 1152.5
gonna be very unexpected

1152.6 --> 1157.3999999999999
because most people in the United States

1154.88 --> 1160.22
especially they just go on like a

1157.4 --> 1163.1000000000001
treadmill system

1160.22 --> 1165.38
where they end up with not so

1163.1 --> 1168.3799999999999
obvious establishment influence very

1165.38 --> 1171.7990000000002
typically so if Dr shiv would actually

1168.38 --> 1174.5
get enough people to get it to win

1171.799 --> 1176.4189999999999
by folk that would be really unexpected

1174.5 --> 1178.34
to a whole bunch of people

1176.419 --> 1181.179
they'll be like what that's the Sheep

1178.34 --> 1181.1789999999999
what who's that

1181.52 --> 1186.02
so yeah I'm very

1183.919 --> 1188.7800000000002
curious to see

1186.02 --> 1189.62
and moderately hopeful that I mean I

1188.78 --> 1191.66
think

1189.62 --> 1194.6789999999999
anybody could do it

1191.66 --> 1194.679
it would be him

1201.26 --> 1208.12
yes yeah though he is definitely a very

1203.96 --> 1208.1200000000001
functional multitasking person

1212.96 --> 1218.859
eye functioning processor

1215.77 --> 1218.859
[Music]

1223.29 --> 1226.78
[Music]

1227.559 --> 1234.32
he's too confident well yeah

1231.799 --> 1236.96
it's kind of because in a way I before I

1234.32 --> 1239.6599999999999
even got to know him really I

1236.96 --> 1242.0
have tried to adapt that more right to

1239.66 --> 1244.1000000000001
just be like yeah you know what I know

1242.0 --> 1247.58
this is probably not going to be popular

1244.1 --> 1249.5
on a wide scale but [ __ ] it this is how

1247.58 --> 1252.6789999999999
I feel about it what do you gotta do

1249.5 --> 1255.98
right I mean it's not hit like his style

1252.679 --> 1258.919
but it is in fact I am very forward

1255.98 --> 1261.44
and open about what's

1258.919 --> 1264.4
in here and where I really stand

1261.44 --> 1264.4
very honest

1266.6 --> 1271.76
so we kind of share that

1269.299 --> 1274.4189999999999
that personal

1271.76 --> 1274.419
attitude

1282.86 --> 1288.3799999999999
the way called a stout and a bunch of

1285.44 --> 1290.419
[ __ ] idiots yeah it's great

1288.38 --> 1291.38
it is funny too because he just gets

1290.419 --> 1294.98
that

1291.38 --> 1297.7990000000002
he does get like a bit slangy in a way

1294.98 --> 1301.48
when he got [ __ ] when he goes [ __ ]

1297.799 --> 1301.48
talking it I get it is

1304.34 --> 1309.559
it is interesting and I recognize it too

1307.039 --> 1312.74
because I had nerd friends in my life

1309.559 --> 1316.059
and and they would also at times do it

1312.74 --> 1316.059
it's kind of talk like that

1316.46 --> 1319.8400000000001
I don't know

1323.419 --> 1329.8690000000001
Brash I guess

1326.79 --> 1329.869
[Music]

1333.86 --> 1339.3799999999999
but I like it like some some it's a bit

1336.44 --> 1343.1000000000001
weird but also it works like how we just

1339.38 --> 1345.5590000000002
shamelessly swears like yep I'm just

1343.1 --> 1349.78
saying it like without a flinch

1345.559 --> 1349.78
I'm just gonna do [ __ ] talking like that

1384.2 --> 1390.1000000000001
what

1386.24 --> 1390.1
what are you talking about

1396.76 --> 1401.62
c t r i what that

1401.96 --> 1409.4
oh is that a location oh all right

1406.039 --> 1411.94
talking Geographics

1409.4 --> 1411.94
uh

1414.86 --> 1422.6589999999999
swam or a bunch but yeah strong language

1418.4 --> 1424.8200000000002
there dare it but that's fine

1422.659 --> 1426.14
as long as I don't have to

1424.82 --> 1428.48
say that

1426.14 --> 1431.659
but uh

1428.48 --> 1432.6200000000001
they're very Hollywood in their own

1431.659 --> 1433.5800000000002
right

1432.62 --> 1437.4189999999999
like

1433.58 --> 1439.58
the not so obvious establishment is like

1437.419 --> 1444.4
trying to be

1439.58 --> 1444.3999999999999
like an undercover a Hollywood a lot

1449.12 --> 1453.9399999999998
right they're subjects their narratives

1451.22 --> 1453.94
are very

1456.34 --> 1462.559
refined and pre-constructed

1459.32 --> 1464.78
they have railroading tracks that they

1462.559 --> 1466.76
typically work with

1464.78 --> 1470.24
so they're like creating their own

1466.76 --> 1474.08
alternative story universe

1470.24 --> 1478.28
and but they are kind of like people

1474.08 --> 1480.1399999999999
from Hollywood so it's almost like the

1478.28 --> 1482.96
not so obvious establishment is like

1480.14 --> 1485.539
their own alternative Hollywood

1482.96 --> 1486.8600000000001
that's like not

1485.539 --> 1490.76
really

1486.86 --> 1492.32
a guild that's behind closed walls among

1490.76 --> 1495.62
themselves but

1492.32 --> 1498.8799999999999
more like oh no no we are one of you

1495.62 --> 1498.8799999999999
we're on your side

1500.36 --> 1506.08
with programming just like Hollywood

1502.52 --> 1506.08
does their programming

1510.559 --> 1514.78
at least that's what I feel about it

1519.74 --> 1524.24
you'll think there's never a cell yes

1521.659 --> 1528.0800000000002
that's correct

1524.24 --> 1531.799
because real thinking requires

1528.08 --> 1533.6
stability which requires principles and

1531.799 --> 1537.62
if you sell out

1533.6 --> 1540.86
or you compromise that literally makes

1537.62 --> 1543.9189999999999
you unstable and thereby you will not be

1540.86 --> 1545.36
able to focus as well and if you're

1543.919 --> 1548.1200000000001
really smart and you have really

1545.36 --> 1551.6789999999999
complicated things that you do

1548.12 --> 1551.6789999999999
then you'd never do that

1553.279 --> 1559.82
so the intellect

1555.799 --> 1562.82
will turn out to mostly be imitation

1559.82 --> 1562.82
copycatting

1563.63 --> 1568.7600000000002
[Music]

1566.419 --> 1571.76
because then you can pretend to be smart

1568.76 --> 1576.22
but you can still sell out and people

1571.76 --> 1576.22
still believe you that are kind of dumb

1577.34 --> 1581.36
right but if you're reeling intellect

1579.26 --> 1583.76
you don't play those types of games

1581.36 --> 1586.1789999999999
because that will compromise your actual

1583.76 --> 1586.179
function

1593.299 --> 1598.72
right

1594.44 --> 1598.72
it would demoralize you

1598.88 --> 1603.8600000000001
and really smart people when they're

1600.919 --> 1606.5800000000002
demoralized they don't function well

1603.86 --> 1606.58
they can't

1607.34 --> 1615.76
give that unique Peak Performance which

1611.179 --> 1615.76
is what everybody always expects of them

1619.88 --> 1622.8400000000001
ARS

1626.779 --> 1633.32
right but if you're like a politician

1629.6 --> 1635.5
type or an actor you can just copy and

1633.32 --> 1635.5
act

1635.659 --> 1640.419
that makes you seem really smart

1640.52 --> 1645.3799999999999
tied in with certain types of ideas that

1643.22 --> 1646.88
are tied in with smart people so that

1645.38 --> 1648.44
you are associated what you're talking

1646.88 --> 1650.6000000000001
about with smart and you can pronounce

1648.44 --> 1654.2
it very well you're an actor so you're

1650.6 --> 1657.4399999999998
bound to be better spoken which also

1654.2 --> 1659.24
helps you makes you seem smarter right

1657.44 --> 1661.039
because there's a lot of like really

1659.24 --> 1664.159
freaking smart people

1661.039 --> 1667.94
that are not really well spoken and they

1664.159 --> 1670.3400000000001
like oh my God like that's the nerd nerd

1667.94 --> 1673.159
yeah but they are often really [ __ ]

1670.34 --> 1675.98
smart they're just not really good

1673.159 --> 1679.6000000000001
he's like haha they're awkward or

1675.98 --> 1679.6
something right nerds

1684.02 --> 1690.86
but if you're an actor then you can

1686.24 --> 1693.14
really copy a smart act but also make

1690.86 --> 1696.26
yourself seem really impressive and

1693.14 --> 1697.7
smart as doing it so more convincingly

1696.26 --> 1699.799
smart

1697.7 --> 1702.26
but since it's not real since you don't

1699.799 --> 1704.179
have like a really complex inner world

1702.26 --> 1706.76
that's like running all these things

1704.179 --> 1709.279
well you could just sell out and cook

1706.76 --> 1711.2
and seem really disgusting or even lying

1709.279 --> 1713.419
about in something in a Petty Way

1711.2 --> 1717.14
publicly it doesn't really matter

1713.419 --> 1720.0200000000002
because it's just an act anyway

1717.14 --> 1722.9
if you're really that smart

1720.02 --> 1726.799
then you wouldn't be able to afford

1722.9 --> 1728.419
cocking and lying getting caught like

1726.799 --> 1730.7
that in public because it would

1728.419 --> 1734.14
demoralize you and that would compromise

1730.7 --> 1734.14
your intellectual function

1736.82 --> 1741.279
there you go there's a systems rollout

1742.159 --> 1744.8200000000002
ah

1747.7 --> 1756.159
RFK seems legit to me yeah yeah more

1751.88 --> 1756.159
color it's a Kennedy

1759.38 --> 1764.96
I mean seriously

1761.659 --> 1770.3600000000001
even everybody that kind of goes around

1764.96 --> 1772.7
him even Alex Jones and other uh infowar

1770.36 --> 1774.799
screw they have their doubts about him

1772.7 --> 1776.539
they're not still they know

1774.799 --> 1780.039
a Kennedy

1776.539 --> 1780.039
they know what that means

1782.48 --> 1788.48
I mean they are just

1785.659 --> 1790.0390000000002
like the other yeah they're a different

1788.48 --> 1793.52
style but they're like one of those

1790.039 --> 1797.32
families right like the bushes

1793.52 --> 1799.8799999999999
and the clintons they are

1797.32 --> 1802.8799999999999
the candidates it's like bushes

1799.88 --> 1804.44
Clinton's Kennedys they are like one of

1802.88 --> 1806.48
the three you could say they're probably

1804.44 --> 1807.799
some others but these are the more known

1806.48 --> 1810.14
families

1807.799 --> 1814.22
that are involved in

1810.14 --> 1817.22
American politics and presidency yeah I

1814.22 --> 1820.52
mean you should know better you you

1817.22 --> 1823.88
should know what that means by now

1820.52 --> 1826.6399999999999
that means that they have massive access

1823.88 --> 1829.5800000000002
to a massive machine

1826.64 --> 1832.22
that really doesn't care

1829.58 --> 1834.98
how they get power

1832.22 --> 1837.919
as long as they get power so if he gets

1834.98 --> 1839.539
that power he could just like that with

1837.919 --> 1842.2990000000002
everything he's rolled out like a

1839.539 --> 1845.059
complete psychopath completely do a 180

1842.299 --> 1848.539
and nobody would be able to do anything

1845.059 --> 1850.22
about it and there could be like more

1848.539 --> 1855.799
war

1850.22 --> 1855.799
even more medical experiment dude

1856.279 --> 1860.419
just like that

1859.039 --> 1864.3799999999999
yeah

1860.419 --> 1867.14
I mean Satan or Lucifer was very

1864.38 --> 1869.24
convincing was very good at reciting the

1867.14 --> 1872.3600000000001
Bible and explaining even some higher

1869.24 --> 1873.86
functions within it yeah very good at

1872.36 --> 1877.7199999999998
telling you

1873.86 --> 1877.7199999999998
but once you give it power

1879.44 --> 1884.779
you got to be very careful with that and

1881.48 --> 1888.5
I mean Shiva saw that

1884.779 --> 1890.84
I see it too like

1888.5 --> 1893.779
I don't trust that guy

1890.84 --> 1896.4189999999999
yeah he's a he's become a very eloquent

1893.779 --> 1898.76
speaker despite his voice issue and

1896.419 --> 1901.3990000000001
maybe even use that to his Advantage too

1898.76 --> 1903.32
it's a trick

1901.399 --> 1905.2399999999998
it's very tricksy Kennedys are very

1903.32 --> 1908.6
tricky

1905.24 --> 1910.94
they have interesting like sociable

1908.6 --> 1914.059
tricks you see is part of their

1910.94 --> 1916.94
personhood that's what they all do

1914.059 --> 1920.36
can like

1916.94 --> 1922.88
Old Kennedy did that too

1920.36 --> 1925.279
anyway

1922.88 --> 1928.159
like they're very Charming but they're

1925.279 --> 1931.779
also dangerous

1928.159 --> 1931.779
and not reliable

1938.179 --> 1943.3400000000001
so yeah

1941.12 --> 1946.34
Don't Get Fooled Again

1943.34 --> 1948.98
I trust Ellie what kind of a bizarre

1946.34 --> 1951.6399999999999
false dichotomy are you shoving in my

1948.98 --> 1951.64
face more color

1953.299 --> 1960.08
dude Alex Jones been like really

1955.7 --> 1961.22
promoting him okay but he even he

1960.08 --> 1964.22
admitted

1961.22 --> 1968.6200000000001
publicly in one of his shows

1964.22 --> 1968.6200000000001
that there is a risk factor and that

1968.899 --> 1974.4799999999998
he could turn

1971.48 --> 1976.82
because it's a Kennedy like

1974.48 --> 1980.419
there's no trusting Alex Jones that

1976.82 --> 1982.34
means that even Alex Jones sees it okay

1980.419 --> 1984.8200000000002
that's what that means he's still doing

1982.34 --> 1988.779
what he does

1984.82 --> 1988.779
get the context right

1993.14 --> 1998.7990000000002
yeah and I have bashed Alex Jones when

1995.899 --> 2002.62
he's doing stupid [ __ ] when he's like

1998.799 --> 2006.1
whining about Muslims when it's like

2002.62 --> 2009.1
that's coming out and he's even also

2006.1 --> 2011.62
like roll that back a bit

2009.1 --> 2015.059
so yeah I criticize Alex Jones when he

2011.62 --> 2015.059
requires some criticizing

2017.14 --> 2023.38
but I mean when he gets things right I

2020.44 --> 2027.039
will also mention that

2023.38 --> 2030.64
it's kind of what he himself does too

2027.039 --> 2032.82
by the way Alex Jones himself is like

2030.64 --> 2032.8200000000002
that

2034.12 --> 2037.4399999999998
he talks about it

2037.72 --> 2043.72
and you've had he's had quite the amount

2040.539 --> 2045.76
of like turncoat situations where people

2043.72 --> 2048.7
he let in and then they turn out to be

2045.76 --> 2050.379
real freaks

2048.7 --> 2052.839
like

2050.379 --> 2055.359
hyper Advanced trolls almost that are

2052.839 --> 2058.179
like trying to get on beside him where

2055.359 --> 2062.44
they can then just be like hahaha

2058.179 --> 2064.119
I'm actually a dirty this or that

2062.44 --> 2066.76
and I'm right in there and they don't

2064.119 --> 2069.339
even know it right

2066.76 --> 2072.2200000000003
so

2069.339 --> 2074.619
Alex does like sometimes let people in

2072.22 --> 2080.02
that turn out to be really untrustworthy

2074.619 --> 2083.52
and then I see that I for me it's like

2080.02 --> 2083.52
why Alex why

2084.58 --> 2089.859
and oh and Benjamin even has that but he

2088.179 --> 2091.96
says that about himself he calls himself

2089.859 --> 2093.04
a bimbo in that sense

2091.96 --> 2096.54
right

2093.04 --> 2096.54
Alex has that too a bit

2101.68 --> 2106.4199999999996
although I mean over the years is

2104.74 --> 2108.7
definitely

2106.42 --> 2112.26
starting to wear on him and I don't

2108.7 --> 2112.2599999999998
think he's more careful now

2113.98 --> 2119.16
think but I mean that could just change

2116.02 --> 2119.16
on a whim so

2124.06 --> 2129.359
they are all plants

2126.82 --> 2129.3590000000004
okay

2153.22 --> 2159.72
okay though yeah sure and I mean it

2156.099 --> 2159.7200000000003
might be a junkie or whatever but

2169.0 --> 2173.68
yeah that doesn't necessarily I mean

2172.48 --> 2176.7400000000002
that's

2173.68 --> 2178.9199999999996
not necessarily the dangerous factor or

2176.74 --> 2178.9199999999996
something

2182.079 --> 2187.8390000000004
I mean

2184.48 --> 2190.119
drug addiction is actually much more

2187.839 --> 2193.7799999999997
common than you think among

2190.119 --> 2193.78
like politicians

2194.44 --> 2198.4
so

2196.54 --> 2202.079
I mean really

2198.4 --> 2202.079
it's been like that for quite a while

2203.2 --> 2208.4199999999996
I think drug abuse has kind of been or

2206.26 --> 2212.7400000000002
drug use when it was still legal was

2208.42 --> 2215.619
quite noted like centuries ago

2212.74 --> 2219.339
so yeah

2215.619 --> 2222.6600000000003
that doesn't necessarily even influence

2219.339 --> 2222.66
things too much

2237.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
all right

2238.98 --> 2243.839
anyway let me get some of this arugula

2312.579 --> 2317.6800000000003
really do appreciate gold

it but I mean uh Trump is like kind of a

2371.02 --> 2375.94
narcissist type

2372.88 --> 2377.619
like that I mean he literally likes to

2375.94 --> 2380.76
be idolized

2377.619 --> 2380.76
that's kind of [ __ ] up

I don't know Dr Shiva says it is not

going to do any good and yeah

2397.18 --> 2400.56
he's probably right

I kind of like Trump the

2493.66 --> 2498.94
did you know I had a whole part in my

2496.66 --> 2500.3799999999997
vision an early one where I actually

2498.94 --> 2503.32
like

2500.38 --> 2505.78
interacted with him

2503.32 --> 2508.619
that was a 97.

2505.78 --> 2508.619
very weird

2509.619 --> 2514.98
because I didn't know him yet but I had

2511.72 --> 2514.98
a good feeling about him though

2515.68 --> 2519.64
it's like

2517.3 --> 2522.6400000000003
I don't know why but

2519.64 --> 2524.6189999999997
despite all the garbage all the [ __ ] and

2522.64 --> 2527.2599999999998
all the nuisance

2524.619 --> 2529.78
and pig-headedness there's something

2527.26 --> 2532.96
about Trump that I'd kind of like on an

2529.78 --> 2535.8590000000004
intuitive or on a physical level just

2532.96 --> 2535.859
kind of like about him

2536.02 --> 2539.339
I mean he is

2540.04 --> 2546.359
a pleasant person to be around I think

2543.7 --> 2546.359
in general

2548.23 --> 2551.61
[Music]

2551.8 --> 2555.3590000000004
but maybe I'm completely wrong about

2553.66 --> 2558.8799999999997
that

2555.359 --> 2562.54
maybe that's just

2558.88 --> 2563.98
something in the vision I don't know

2562.54 --> 2566.2599999999998
but I

2563.98 --> 2568.18
leave it on a spiritual level had like a

2566.26 --> 2571.6600000000003
whole

2568.18 --> 2574.2
tour of the investment you could say

2571.66 --> 2574.2
I

2574.72 --> 2577.9599999999996
I thought

2575.92 --> 2580.7400000000002
that in whatever I was doing I was

2577.96 --> 2580.7400000000002
giving him energy

2581.92 --> 2586.5
a substantial amount

2583.9 --> 2586.5
actually

2591.76 --> 2595.92
but that was in the earlier stage

2596.38 --> 2601.839
it turned out like I was really

2598.9 --> 2604.119
enthusiastic even for Trump when he like

2601.839 --> 2606.72
first got in there I mean a whole bunch

2604.119 --> 2606.7200000000003
of people were

2607.599 --> 2612.4
and maybe it represented that maybe the

2610.24 --> 2615.04
fishing part represented that but I did

2612.4 --> 2617.88
remember that I saw that whole thing in

2615.04 --> 2617.88
97.

2620.02 --> 2626.52
uh Trump does exactly what yeah

2623.859 --> 2626.52
I mean

2626.619 --> 2631.38
Trump is basically the fourth house

2634.359 --> 2637.619
I mean this is Trump

2638.02 --> 2644.2
even after him his family is probably in

2642.28 --> 2646.119
the future also gonna try to run for

2644.2 --> 2649.1189999999997

2646.119 --> 2651.6600000000003
to become another presidential family in

2649.119 --> 2651.6600000000003
the United States

2653.819 --> 2661.38
and he's probably already secured that

2657.46 --> 2661.38
that that's gonna keep happening now

2667.24 --> 2669.66
continue

2688.78 --> 2694.7400000000002

you got a clue man you got a clue

3120.54 --> 3125.52
if you think everybody on the stage are

3123.059 --> 3129.559
all actors it's all fake then why the

3125.52 --> 3129.559
[ __ ] are you on media

3130.079 --> 3135.3590000000004
get off Media then George Sanford go and

3133.44 --> 3137.94
actually do something with your life

3135.359 --> 3139.38
instead of complaining how anything on

3137.94 --> 3141.059
media is

3139.38 --> 3145.52
fake

3141.059 --> 3145.52
now that would include me then

3150.9 --> 3156.3
oh you do a lot oh yeah I bet you do

3153.42 --> 3158.76
well maybe that entertainment is

3156.3 --> 3159.599
glooming off some satanic messages on

3158.76 --> 3162.1800000000003
you

3159.599 --> 3164.42
is rubbing off on you

3162.18 --> 3164.4199999999996
because

3166.02 --> 3171.839
so you're okay with watching at

3169.14 --> 3174.359
deceiving devils and demons as long as

3171.839 --> 3177.42
you believe that nobody of them could

3174.359 --> 3180.72
actually be a real person

3177.42 --> 3183.839
you literally are in Hell aren't you a

3180.72 --> 3186.6189999999997
yard Sanford you're actually inside in

3183.839 --> 3186.619
Hell aren't you

3226.74 --> 3231.4799999999996
I don't think George Sanford would mind

3228.9 --> 3233.7000000000003
going to hell as long as they had

3231.48 --> 3236.4
reach on his mobile so he could still

3233.7 --> 3238.5
watch entertainment which he thinks are

3236.4 --> 3240.48
all demons anyway so there wouldn't be

3238.5 --> 3242.339
much of a difference he was if he was

3240.48 --> 3246.26
actually in hell

3242.339 --> 3246.2599999999998
or just thinking he's in hell

3246.54 --> 3250.88
because everybody's demons and fake

3255.66 --> 3260.5789999999997
and I mean yeah a lot are

3258.54 --> 3262.92
but there's plenty of people that aren't

3260.579 --> 3266.099
fake they just don't get the big

3262.92 --> 3269.7000000000003
Spotlight yeah only the turrets flow to

3266.099 --> 3271.8590000000004
float to the top anything other than a

3269.7 --> 3274.7999999999997
turd needs to like

3271.859 --> 3279.119
you then need to build a Bottoms Up

3274.8 --> 3284.3590000000004
situation to push you to the top

3279.119 --> 3284.359
because only turds float to the top

3294.359 --> 3299.2799999999997
right if you just see it like that you

3296.88 --> 3302.1600000000003
have a much more realistic balanced feel

3299.28 --> 3305.099
on the world George Sanford

3302.16 --> 3307.68
not everybody in the [ __ ] world on

3305.099 --> 3310.4
the screen is a cell app

3307.68 --> 3310.3999999999996
okay

3313.31 --> 3316.449
[Music]

3324.46 --> 3327.55
[Music]

3330.42 --> 3335.52
just be careful when things get kind of

3333.119 --> 3336.96
aggressively shoved in your face

3335.52 --> 3339.3
right

3336.96 --> 3341.579
because those are the turrets those are

3339.3 --> 3343.7400000000002
the things that get pushed that flow to

3341.579 --> 3345.6600000000003
the top get all the attention everybody

3343.74 --> 3348.0789999999997
starts talking about them those are the

3345.66 --> 3348.0789999999997
thirds

3348.9 --> 3354.3
is there any good then everybody will

3351.359 --> 3355.7999999999997
try to silence them all the time pretend

3354.3 --> 3358.26
like they don't exist like with old

3355.8 --> 3359.7000000000003
Benjamin yeah that's how you know they

3358.26 --> 3363.1800000000003
are in deterrent

3359.7 --> 3366.18
even if you don't like what they have to

3363.18 --> 3369.7799999999997
say or you disagree about certain things

3366.18 --> 3372.839
with them yeah because that

3369.78 --> 3375.8390000000004
you disagreeing with them or not is not

3372.839 --> 3379.46
the ultimate Arbiter on whether somebody

3375.839 --> 3379.46
is evil out there yeah

3411.78 --> 3416.9
what makes an illuminatic or some

3413.819 --> 3416.9
illuminatic or song

3419.22 --> 3423.8999999999996
mostly the shape

3421.68 --> 3426.0
the shape is the reason why I started

3423.9 --> 3428.48
calling it Illuminati comes on that's

3426.0 --> 3428.48
really it

3429.839 --> 3435.48
it is stuffed with something but it's

3431.88 --> 3439.319
just like a vegetable paste

3435.48 --> 3441.2400000000002
with like carrots and peas and

3439.319 --> 3444.24
stuff

3441.24 --> 3446.839
it's like this vegan paste thing but

3444.24 --> 3446.839
it's pretty good

3450.24 --> 3456.4399999999996
yeah they're not actually called

3452.04 --> 3456.44
Illuminati cassands where I buy them

3460.76 --> 3464.96
yeah I named it that

3473.22 --> 3478.14
it only becomes an Illuminati croissant

3475.92 --> 3480.7200000000003
when you

3478.14 --> 3483.72
name it in the illuminatios song that's

3480.72 --> 3486.72
where you infuse the Illuminati casan

3483.72 --> 3489.98
magic into it

3486.72 --> 3489.98
through your naming

3494.28 --> 3498.8390000000004
I'm a pastry no more yeah I'm a pastry

3497.52 --> 3502.22
anymore

3498.839 --> 3502.22
I name pastries

3508.559 --> 3513.8
it's trauma nowhere

3510.24 --> 3513.7999999999997
that's what it would be wouldn't you

3515.819 --> 3520.22
man this feels even too silly for me

3531.9 --> 3536.359
like this Samosa oh okay

3537.72 --> 3541.5589999999997
yeah

3538.92 --> 3544.76
have a good meal with that Terry

thank you

3630.74 --> 3636.499
all right that was delicious

3633.28 --> 3636.4990000000003
[Music]

3656.359 --> 3661.619
yeah now Terry is definitely a busy man

3659.16 --> 3665.359
but I mean

3661.619 --> 3665.359
he's getting somewhere with it

3668.22 --> 3674.9599999999996
it's not like he he's doing like a lame

3671.04 --> 3674.96
slave job right Terry

3683.52 --> 3687.799
would go home two months from wow

3702.059 --> 3705.6800000000003
yeah what did you do Tarot

3707.4 --> 3711.319
weren't you like still studying

3736.75 --> 3739.78
[Music]

3743.099 --> 3746.88
an evening

3745.079 --> 3748.1400000000003
when I look forward to oh that's awesome

3746.88 --> 3750.6600000000003
thank you

3748.14 --> 3753.839
glad you appreciate my show I do forget

3750.66 --> 3755.16
sometimes that yeah it's evening where

3753.839 --> 3758.42
you're at

3755.16 --> 3758.42
when my show is live

3771.54 --> 3773.7799999999997
right

3779.119 --> 3783.38
7 A.M for you wow

3804.599 --> 3809.94
brings us together completely takes out

3807.18 --> 3811.319
intimacy out of conversation well Mark

3809.94 --> 3814.319
collard

3811.319 --> 3816.839
it has the tendency to do that but it

3814.319 --> 3820.579
doesn't necessarily do that I mean you

3816.839 --> 3820.5789999999997
can have very intimate contact

3821.04 --> 3826.619
over the internet

3823.92 --> 3828.66
but I mean if it's only that then yeah

3826.619 --> 3830.52
that gonna that sucks and it's just an

3828.66 --> 3834.48
internet relationship then

3830.52 --> 3836.579
but I mean you can be very personal

3834.48 --> 3839.099
and all that it's just that if you're

3836.579 --> 3842.6400000000003
like on social media and people just

3839.099 --> 3844.8590000000004
okay and get involved yeah it gets messy

3842.64 --> 3848.04
very quickly and gets very watered down

3844.859 --> 3851.52
and generic usually

3848.04 --> 3853.98
that's the issue but I mean

3851.52 --> 3856.319
you can you can

3853.98 --> 3860.579
still have intimacy

3856.319 --> 3863.18
over the internet can be very personal

3860.579 --> 3863.1800000000003
all that

3865.68 --> 3871.64
internet release

3867.839 --> 3871.64
well they're just useless

3875.64 --> 3883.2
Ares 106. they're just useless

3880.38 --> 3885.54
like the only reason I'd ever when I

3883.2 --> 3887.339
actually tried it

3885.54 --> 3890.7799999999997
two thousand

3887.339 --> 3890.7799999999997
seven and eight

3892.44 --> 3897.48
the only reason I'd even want to do that

3894.96 --> 3899.2200000000003
is because I would want to actually meet

3897.48 --> 3900.48
them and have an actual relationship

3899.22 --> 3904.5589999999997
with them

3900.48 --> 3907.4
but that rarely ends up happening or at

3904.559 --> 3907.4
least they did back then

3914.4 --> 3916.94
what

3923.46 --> 3927.119
there's something lost in the signal

3925.44 --> 3929.7000000000003
that's there

3927.119 --> 3931.98
oh yeah you don't have like the physical

3929.7 --> 3934.46
contact

3931.98 --> 3934.46
thing

3935.22 --> 3939.66
that's right

3937.26 --> 3941.8190000000004
if you've only ever met somebody through

3939.66 --> 3943.44
the internet you don't really get to

3941.819 --> 3945.0
know them

3943.44 --> 3947.52
you only get to know them if you

3945.0 --> 3949.74
basically shake their hand

3947.52 --> 3953.24
because you get that physical component

3949.74 --> 3953.24
about them to fill in

3971.52 --> 3975.559
oh okay Mark

3981.119 --> 3986.94
yeah one more colored like Aries comment

3983.52 --> 3990.02
was definitely not a top level comment

3986.94 --> 3990.02
if you know what I mean

3991.2 --> 3995.359
so I guess YouTube called that correctly

4002.66 --> 4006.2
and I'm not getting your joke turret

4004.76 --> 4009.1600000000003
okay

4006.2 --> 4009.16
I guess I'm not

4030.32 --> 4033.9390000000003
[Music]

4039.94 --> 4044.539
right anyway

4041.96 --> 4047.0
uh yeah I got all the time in the world

4044.539 --> 4050.3190000000004
because Nathan's not having a live show

4047.0 --> 4050.319
with fed today

4050.839 --> 4056.0789999999997
uh

4052.46 --> 4056.079
go out to do anything

4067.4 --> 4072.46
you saying hello is not YouTube friendly

4070.22 --> 4072.4599999999996
what

4074.72 --> 4078.0389999999998
let's joining let me check that

4082.46 --> 4088.4
that's weird

4084.5 --> 4090.559
no I I see most of your posts or all of

4088.4 --> 4092.9
them I but I also I just turned the top

4090.559 --> 4094.8190000000004
chat and that comment from aries106 is

4092.9 --> 4099.16
also missing

4094.819 --> 4099.16
so I guess they just don't like you

4099.739 --> 4105.98
saying some generic thing is satanic I

4104.299 --> 4109.1
think that YouTube doesn't really

4105.98 --> 4111.379999999999
appreciate people saying that

4109.1 --> 4114.04
because it's really stupid and

4111.38 --> 4114.04
superstitious

4115.219 --> 4120.799
even though they're made it indirectly

4117.98 --> 4124.599999999999
be some truth to it if you

4120.799 --> 4124.6
explain it a little better

4127.88 --> 4133.4800000000005
YouTube is targeting you oh poor you

4135.83 --> 4139.01
[Music]

4156.679 --> 4160.359
they know he's on to something

4175.819 --> 4180.799
it was a wrenched yeah yeah I guess it

4179.0 --> 4183.699
does make a difference mark

4180.799 --> 4183.699
the wrench

4185.839 --> 4188.0199999999995
foreign

4188.179 --> 4195.26
they don't care well whoever they are

4192.62 --> 4196.76
knowing somebody's onto something does

4195.26 --> 4198.1990000000005
not ask

4196.76 --> 4201.56
include

4198.199 --> 4203.12
them not caring about it that what they

4201.56 --> 4206.4400000000005
know yeah just because they know doesn't

4203.12 --> 4206.44
mean that they care so

4206.48 --> 4208.959999999999
whatever

4218.179 --> 4225.34
right yes Mark colored

4221.48 --> 4225.339999999999
I don't seem to be censored

4227.96 --> 4230.86
out there

4232.4 --> 4235.839999999999
I should check that though

4243.739 --> 4246.739
anyway

4262.34 --> 4264.9400000000005
foreign

4271.239 --> 4276.0199999999995
not just this

4274.04 --> 4278.32
but I think I already went through

4276.02 --> 4278.320000000001
everything

4281.9 --> 4286.9
Parliament falling situation we're gonna

4284.36 --> 4286.9
have to show

4289.46 --> 4292.2390000000005
uh

4293.84 --> 4298.900000000001
did politics talk and about Shiva

4299.54 --> 4303.5199999999995
and the nuts always establishment

4305.659 --> 4308.98
now what

4325.52 --> 4328.2390000000005
look

4330.14 --> 4334.360000000001
really more color I don't know about

4332.0 --> 4334.36
that

4336.44 --> 4339.259999999999
I really don't know about that more

4338.42 --> 4342.46
color

4339.26 --> 4342.46
if it works like that

4342.98 --> 4348.44
I mean technically outside of what

4345.679 --> 4351.08
people bring to the table like

4348.44 --> 4353.839999999999
the owner of a channel the moderators

4351.08 --> 4356.0599999999995
that he assigns beside that I don't

4353.84 --> 4358.2390000000005
think there's any human influences at

4356.06 --> 4358.2390000000005
all

4359.6 --> 4368.42
just a couple of guys that make like

4364.46 --> 4371.42
decisions on like strike appeals maybe

4368.42 --> 4373.9400000000005
and maybe that's fully AI too I don't

4371.42 --> 4375.92
even know I don't feel that there's any

4373.94 --> 4378.5
actual people that

4375.92 --> 4379.58
that we deal with on the other side of

4378.5 --> 4382.96
YouTube

4379.58 --> 4382.96
it's all automated

4385.76 --> 4391.58
there's no tier where somebody has to

4388.4 --> 4394.159
manually start confirming things why

4391.58 --> 4397.719
because that would be intainable it

4394.159 --> 4397.719
would be too expensive to do that

4407.12 --> 4410.12
foreign

4416.86 --> 4422.08
yeah because Aries 106 was wrong

4423.199 --> 4431.5
and it's because of what he said in that

4425.9 --> 4431.5
one sentence that makes it not show up

4433.28 --> 4436.96
that's algorithmic decision

4442.1 --> 4446.2390000000005
everything else he said it just was

4443.96 --> 4448.04
still registers it's just that one

4446.239 --> 4450.08
sentence because of the nature of the

4448.04 --> 4452.62
sentence because of the words used in

4450.08 --> 4452.62
the sentence

4458.84 --> 4460.84
um

4470.3 --> 4477.7390000000005
YouTube moderator team well yeah there

4474.199 --> 4480.379999999999
is a moderator team of people or there

4477.739 --> 4483.0199999999995
used to be that

4480.38 --> 4485.84
but they were not very good

4483.02 --> 4490.780000000001
they all got political and

4485.84 --> 4490.78
basically socially degenerate

4492.98 --> 4499.159
that weren't actually proper moderators

4495.98 --> 4502.0
more like political

4499.159 --> 4502.0
tinkerers

4505.94 --> 4510.04
block my YouTube moderator right

4510.739 --> 4514.759999999999
yeah but I mean that was years ago since

4513.02 --> 4517.120000000001
I've last even seen that happen to

4514.76 --> 4517.12
anybody

4517.94 --> 4521.199
I think they're all gone

4526.46 --> 4530.9800000000005
they might have just canceled that

4528.26 --> 4530.9800000000005
entire thing

4538.64 --> 4543.159000000001
because it was just only being abused

4544.4 --> 4546.94
right

4550.46 --> 4555.44
but I do remember like years ago that

4553.52 --> 4557.659000000001
that was happening that there were like

4555.44 --> 4560.86
YouTube moderated team and that they

4557.659 --> 4560.86
would just suddenly start

4561.14 --> 4567.58
doing things because people were very

4564.02 --> 4567.580000000001
angry and passionate yet

4567.92 --> 4571.6
they would just start to meddle

4571.9 --> 4578.839999999999
bear very bad I mean that's just

4574.699 --> 4581.239
complete that's not a moderator function

4578.84 --> 4583.52
like that's a channel moderator because

4581.239 --> 4587.299999999999
the channel owner might have certain

4583.52 --> 4589.52
preferences and all that right but

4587.3 --> 4591.679
an outside moderate it's none of their

4589.52 --> 4595.159000000001
[ __ ] business

4591.679 --> 4597.4400000000005
yeah simply is none of their [ __ ]

4595.159 --> 4598.389999999999
business they get involved with any kind

4597.44 --> 4601.599999999999
of live stream

4598.39 --> 4601.6
[Music]

4602.56 --> 4606.1
anyway cheers

4610.73 --> 4613.839999999999
[Music]

4617.659 --> 4620.44
okay Mark

4625.219 --> 4630.159
what do I do outside of YouTube well not

4627.92 --> 4630.159
much

4634.46 --> 4638.9800000000005
don't really have any more Hobbies nope

4639.679 --> 4645.02
I follow a lot of social media things

4643.699 --> 4648.08
people

4645.02 --> 4651.5
news things and

4648.08 --> 4652.94
to get my material together my and my

4651.5 --> 4654.44
dream walking

4652.94 --> 4657.44
and

4654.44 --> 4659.48
play some games here and there no but

4657.44 --> 4662.54
nothing new I'm not like oh what the

4659.48 --> 4665.299999999999
newest game so I do gaming a bit let's

4662.54 --> 4667.4
just recycle the old stuff

4665.3 --> 4669.64
and

4667.4 --> 4669.639999999999
yeah

4670.58 --> 4676.54
don't have much of a

4672.739 --> 4676.54
set of hobbies anymore really

4678.62 --> 4685.12
I used to be a dungeon master with

4680.719 --> 4685.12
Dungeons and Dragons and then stupid

4685.36 --> 4689.62
2020 happened and that's gone

4728.659 --> 4733.648999999999
foreign

4730.47 --> 4733.649
[Music]

4737.12 --> 4742.64
I could just get a hobby or something if

4740.3 --> 4745.96
there was some incentive and don't need

4742.64 --> 4745.96
money to do it

4757.34 --> 4762.26
it's just that I am not a person that's

4759.62 --> 4765.62
like I got to do something new I'm going

4762.26 --> 4768.7390000000005
crazy no no I'll just do the same

4765.62 --> 4771.0199999999995
[ __ ] [ __ ] over and over and over and

4768.739 --> 4772.94
over again for a decade straight so

4771.02 --> 4775.52
repetitive that you'd think like every

4772.94 --> 4780.28
[ __ ] day was the same day

4775.52 --> 4780.280000000001
and I barely have a problem with it

4786.46 --> 4794.179
drive-in theaters movie and garbage yeah

4791.98 --> 4797.48
programming is a hobby go [ __ ] yourself

4794.179 --> 4799.52
dude go [ __ ] yourself I'm not gonna do

4797.48 --> 4801.919999999999
programming

4799.52 --> 4805.4800000000005
if I could have become a programmer I

4801.92 --> 4805.4800000000005
would have become a programmer

4806.179 --> 4810.6990000000005
besides it's [ __ ] pointless now

4811.219 --> 4817.219
becoming a programmer is completely

4814.42 --> 4819.5
Superfluous now

4817.219 --> 4823.179
you can literally

4819.5 --> 4825.739
like AI is already

4823.179 --> 4828.34
designed to literally do your

4825.739 --> 4828.339999999999
programming

4840.62 --> 4843.159
right

4843.86 --> 4850.42
the only programming that's going to be

4846.5 --> 4850.42
left is the programming of

4850.52 --> 4853.42
of AI

4853.699 --> 4858.919999999999
because you can't leave the AI to

4856.82 --> 4860.179
program the AI

4858.92 --> 4861.86
because

4860.179 --> 4865.54
well

4861.86 --> 4865.54
because of obvious reasons

4869.719 --> 4874.96
pick up a guitar

4871.58 --> 4874.96
okay good and you

4876.08 --> 4881.9
I dreamwalk

4879.199 --> 4884.36
listen to think things think about

4881.9 --> 4886.9
things walking around on my balcony

4884.36 --> 4886.9
thinking

4887.84 --> 4895.1
I do it a lot

4891.02 --> 4899.780000000001
I'm not doing any musical instruments

4895.1 --> 4903.26
because I don't have a house to myself

4899.78 --> 4908.32
so I just I don't do that

4903.26 --> 4908.320000000001
and I'm not really a musician anyway

4909.38 --> 4914.0
I just I'll use my voice I'll sing

4911.96 --> 4918.34
something if I feel like it

4914.0 --> 4918.34
that's it headphones no

4921.62 --> 4927.14
I don't do headphones

4924.32 --> 4928.46
unless it's absolutely essential in the

4927.14 --> 4931.42
moment

4928.46 --> 4931.42
but no

4934.04 --> 4938.92
yeah I don't care if there's headphones

4935.96 --> 4938.92
I'm not doing it

4942.88 --> 4948.34
besides headphones don't work on an

4945.56 --> 4948.34
acoustic guitar

4974.32 --> 4981.58
yeah but I'm not gonna be a top-notch

4977.84 --> 4981.58
programmer Ares 106.

4982.82 --> 4991.46
I'm not a coder type

4985.82 --> 4996.34
that's a whole I am a planner type

4991.46 --> 4996.34
I'm the guy that tells the coders

4996.86 --> 5000.12
I'm not a coder

5003.64 --> 5009.719
I'm more like a designer architect

5006.48 --> 5009.718999999999
planner type

5013.0 --> 5017.02
yeah you could do anything yeah yeah you

5015.04 --> 5018.159
could learn how to [ __ ] yourself up but

5017.02 --> 5020.02
you can learn

5018.159 --> 5021.94
to

5020.02 --> 5024.76
literally

5021.94 --> 5027.099999999999
talk yourself into complete retardation

5024.76 --> 5030.6990000000005
you can learn anything but I'm not going

5027.1 --> 5033.6990000000005
to so stop telling me what the [ __ ]

5030.699 --> 5036.099999999999
do I'm not gonna attain a [ __ ]

5033.699 --> 5039.639999999999
profession because some people on

5036.1 --> 5041.8
YouTube suddenly tell me to okay

5039.64 --> 5045.400000000001
in my chat

5041.8 --> 5048.219
can you stop making a habit of trying to

5045.4 --> 5051.46
push that [ __ ] on me trying to tell me

5048.219 --> 5054.179
what to do with my [ __ ] life

5051.46 --> 5054.179
stop it

5064.78 --> 5070.179
yeah I don't give a [ __ ] about your only

5067.0 --> 5072.64
suggestions I don't give a [ __ ] you will

5070.179 --> 5075.34
not tell me what to do you will not tell

5072.64 --> 5078.400000000001
me how to live my life

5075.34 --> 5081.4800000000005
and that's final

5078.4 --> 5081.48
do you understand

5087.4 --> 5093.46
I suggest you shut the [ __ ] up about how

5091.6 --> 5095.92
I should live my life that's my

5093.46 --> 5098.4
suggestion yeah

5095.92 --> 5098.4
foreign

5100.86 --> 5104.12
[Music]

5106.96 --> 5111.6
if I need a tip I'll ask

5119.159 --> 5124.42
Bonsai ah cool

5122.56 --> 5126.88
that's interesting

5124.42 --> 5129.159
well I effectively just treat my herb

5126.88 --> 5129.36
plants like Bonsai I'm very careful with

5129.159 --> 5131.86
them

5129.36 --> 5133.9
[Music]

5131.86 --> 5135.639999999999

you could do this maybe you could do

5141.82 --> 5146.86
that oh you should do this you should do

5143.86 --> 5149.199
maybe you should just

5146.86 --> 5151.839999999999
figure out

5149.199 --> 5153.699
a good subject maybe a piece of

5151.84 --> 5156.82
information maybe

5153.699 --> 5161.28
a question about things that aren't

5156.82 --> 5161.28
directly my life and what I do

5170.5 --> 5174.159

5198.76 --> 5204.04
huh

5200.92 --> 5207.4
just because I approve

5204.04 --> 5210.82
of what somebody is doing does not mean

5207.4 --> 5214.299999999999
yes I want to do that right now yeah no

5210.82 --> 5216.5199999999995

5214.3 --> 5219.219
what to do

5216.52 --> 5222.34
with my life do you understand

5219.219 --> 5224.86
yeah I don't need any suggestions on

5234.159 --> 5240.638999999999
yeah you are brah you are telling that

5238.06 --> 5242.1990000000005
in the sentence right before that yeah

5240.639 --> 5244.84
when you say that would be a good thing

5242.199 --> 5247.659
for you yeah that's literally telling me

5244.84 --> 5249.82
Oh you should do this

5247.659 --> 5251.08
it's none of your [ __ ] business what

5249.82 --> 5253.679
I should do

5251.08 --> 5253.679
okay

5262.35 --> 5267.280000000001
[Music]

5264.219 --> 5270.46
you should think of an interesting

5267.28 --> 5273.639
subject to talk about

5270.46 --> 5277.8
and stop trying to

5273.639 --> 5277.8
meddle with my life

5285.4 --> 5290.0199999999995
hello

5287.93 --> 5295.38
[Music]

5290.02 --> 5295.38
a Tran train is here oh God

5309.82 --> 5313.78

5312.28 --> 5316.739
things no

5313.78 --> 5316.739
no I don't

5323.98 --> 5328.678999999999
I don't think it's healthy to try new

5326.44 --> 5328.678999999999
things

5329.92 --> 5335.32
I think it's healthy to figure out old

5333.28 --> 5336.46
things

5335.32 --> 5338.5599999999995
yeah

5336.46 --> 5342.3
don't need to try new things why don't

5338.56 --> 5342.3
you try to figure out the old things

5344.44 --> 5348.04
yeah

5345.88 --> 5349.96
a lot of old things are kind of like

5348.04 --> 5353.139
forgotten look down upon Cena

5349.96 --> 5356.56
Superfluous when there was a lot more to

5353.139 --> 5358.78
the balancing and the reasoning why it

5356.56 --> 5362.26
was the way it was yeah why don't you

5358.78 --> 5366.3
try old things yeah all things had a lot

5362.26 --> 5366.3
more durability to them

5371.76 --> 5377.02
and talk about training yeah good luck

5374.679 --> 5380.88
with that

5377.02 --> 5384.079000000001
I'm not gonna talk about trains

5380.88 --> 5384.079
[Music]

5393.34 --> 5399.4800000000005
old Steve really Marx okay that's

5396.76 --> 5399.4800000000005
interesting

5404.26 --> 5408.360000000001
foreign

5405.58 --> 5408.36
wow

5408.699 --> 5414.4
so does that mean he's like

5411.4 --> 5414.4
casting

5414.699 --> 5419.5
Giant

5416.44 --> 5422.199
pig iron casting

5419.5 --> 5425.219
a giant structure I mean that's one hell

5422.199 --> 5425.219
of a casting project

5425.34 --> 5433.26
you need a huge mold for that

5430.0 --> 5433.26
mole Grit

5438.94 --> 5443.86
or is he just

5441.3 --> 5445.4800000000005
re-engineering a new form

5443.86 --> 5448.179
of steam train

5445.48 --> 5452.459999999999
because back then they didn't use steel

5448.179 --> 5452.46
they used pig iron I think cast iron

5465.88 --> 5472.6
show man's locomotives what

5469.96 --> 5475.26
so it is like a cast iron thing that

5472.6 --> 5475.26
he's making then

5494.32 --> 5500.5599999999995
replica oh so it's like a mini train

5496.719 --> 5502.659
then it's not the actual size

5500.56 --> 5506.88
it's scaled down

5502.659 --> 5506.879999999999
and for like a kitty train right

5508.199 --> 5512.699
in at amusement parks

5523.48 --> 5526.32
thank you

[Music]

5598.719 --> 5600.78
what

5622.739 --> 5630.9
okay a Journeys here

5626.82 --> 5630.9
that's [ __ ] pointless

5633.4 --> 5640.679
seems like another [ __ ] AI [ __ ]

5637.0 --> 5640.679
comment so get the [ __ ] up

5641.199 --> 5647.5
yeah another [ __ ] pointless

5643.679 --> 5652.02
incohesive nonsense story

5647.5 --> 5652.02
I hate those comments

5695.28 --> 5701.32
uh Mark Collard I I don't know but I do

5698.98 --> 5704.0199999999995
know that American cannabis has like

5701.32 --> 5705.639
been really too strong it's been made

5704.02 --> 5711.3
too strong so

5705.639 --> 5711.3
I think I'm just like mid-range THC CBD

5722.32 --> 5729.12
what I smoke is definitely stronger than

5724.96 --> 5729.12
like what I used to smoke in the 90s

5732.1 --> 5737.08
but it's not like that stuff from

5734.56 --> 5740.26
America that just immediately makes me

5737.08 --> 5742.0
hallucinate in a bad way

5740.26 --> 5743.58
because that's what that stuff does to

5742.0 --> 5746.44
me

5743.58 --> 5749.739
like that American cannabis when I smoke

5746.44 --> 5752.259999999999
that I actually it actually feels like

5749.739 --> 5755.759999999999
I'm getting poisoned

5752.26 --> 5755.76
that's not a good feeling

5793.659 --> 5798.4
yeah that's right my color yeah no I

5796.06 --> 5801.219
agree I I like the wider Spectrum the

5798.4 --> 5802.98
more naturally your own stuff and not

5801.219 --> 5807.179
all this

5802.98 --> 5807.178999999999
weaponized cannabis right

5807.699 --> 5811.54
and that luckily like I'm not the only

5809.92 --> 5814.2390000000005
one it's not like all the coffee shops

5811.54 --> 5815.92
here I have all the only the weaponized

5814.239 --> 5818.379999999999
[ __ ] any I really have to look to even

5815.92 --> 5821.02
get an exception to that no no people in

5818.38 --> 5823.679
general here agree like that stuff is

5821.02 --> 5823.679
not normal

5827.8 --> 5832.06
like there's plenty of people that say

5829.84 --> 5833.26
oh cannabis is not actually a drug it's

5832.06 --> 5836.639
a medicine

5833.26 --> 5840.219
but that weaponized Californian weed

5836.639 --> 5843.52
that's a drug that's not medicine like

5840.219 --> 5846.1
that that doesn't have the

5843.52 --> 5848.34
the benefits that are physically healthy

5846.1 --> 5848.34
anymore

5850.78 --> 5855.94
so you see very little of that type of

5853.12 --> 5858.639
cannabis here it is there but it's like

5855.94 --> 5861.178999999999
in the corner for those that really want

5858.639 --> 5861.179
to try it

5863.199 --> 5867.719
anyway uh be right back two minutes

5870.49 --> 5873.74
[Music]

5971.56 --> 5974.56
foreign

6010.56 --> 6014.780000000001
yeah I do have a lot to say

6036.179 --> 6038.84
huh

6042.659 --> 6046.58
okay that's interesting more colored

6063.239 --> 6069.599999999999
tell you what yeah maybe Mark I mean

6066.78 --> 6072.179
but I mean you'd have to you should try

6069.6 --> 6075.2390000000005
actually like getting on as a guest

6072.179 --> 6077.34
first before you start your own show but

6075.239 --> 6080.218999999999
hey if you wanna

6077.34 --> 6082.32
get on my show maybe sometime and

6080.219 --> 6085.26
as a guest

6082.32 --> 6087.599999999999
when you really feel like talking

6085.26 --> 6089.04
we could do that I could have you on you

6087.6 --> 6092.9400000000005
don't necessarily have to be on camera

6089.04 --> 6094.619
if you don't want that or you're good

6092.94 --> 6098.94
it's up to you

6094.619 --> 6101.159
what you want to be showing

6098.94 --> 6102.96
and hey if you want to come on one time

6101.159 --> 6104.638999999999
when you're extra chatty you want to

6102.96 --> 6106.32
talk

6104.639 --> 6109.8
we could do that

6106.32 --> 6111.719
seriously think about this yeah cool

6109.8 --> 6115.9400000000005
yeah let me know I mean it's just like

6111.719 --> 6115.94
with the stairs Moretz right

6118.26 --> 6124.02
I mean I'm not like

6120.6 --> 6126.119000000001
I'm actually free to do technically how

6124.02 --> 6128.040000000001
I want to do it I just don't like to be

6126.119 --> 6130.739
told how to do it and I like to do

6128.04 --> 6132.6
things the same way often but when

6130.739 --> 6134.339999999999
something happens

6132.6 --> 6136.7390000000005
that changes the energy and all that

6134.34 --> 6139.679
like yeah sure I'd have you on I'll do

6136.739 --> 6141.599999999999
it a different type of show

6139.679 --> 6145.9400000000005
sometime try it out

6141.6 --> 6145.9400000000005
a little variation can be refreshing

6152.219 --> 6157.679
but yeah as long as it's not like oh

6154.44 --> 6160.08
well it's been too long since I tried

6157.679 --> 6163.1990000000005
something new I have to keep trying

6160.08 --> 6165.36
something new no no no how about I just

6163.199 --> 6167.58
do the same [ __ ] thing hundreds of

6165.36 --> 6169.32
times over and over and over again and

6167.58 --> 6172.34
still like it

6169.32 --> 6172.34
how about that

6173.639 --> 6180.139
but that doesn't mean that you can't

6176.34 --> 6180.139
even try anything else ever

6180.179 --> 6189.32
that that would just be pointless anyway

6184.619 --> 6189.32
what am I gonna try programming thanks

6194.46 --> 6197.119
foreign

6204.02 --> 6210.2390000000005
programming if this is if somebody and

6207.96 --> 6213.0
they don't exist that literally doesn't

6210.239 --> 6214.799999999999
if somebody would be willing to like be

6213.0 --> 6218.28
a personal tutor

6214.8 --> 6221.1
in that but that's ridiculous nobody

6218.28 --> 6223.679
would ever do that without a substantial

6221.1 --> 6225.42
check to back it up because programming

6223.679 --> 6227.76
is [ __ ] tedious

6225.42 --> 6230.4
and I can't imagine that teaching

6227.76 --> 6232.92
somebody to program is even more tedious

6230.4 --> 6236.219
so

6232.92 --> 6239.52
why the hell would I even do that like

6236.219 --> 6242.04
if I'd have to teach myself I I do I can

6239.52 --> 6244.1990000000005
barely read a book beyond two pages

6242.04 --> 6246.42
without getting distracted

6244.199 --> 6248.638999999999
and that's a book that I actually want

6246.42 --> 6251.179
to read

6248.639 --> 6251.179
so

6253.56 --> 6258.780000000001
it's like

6255.78 --> 6262.82
the amount of energy that is required to

6258.78 --> 6262.82
get to that point is just not worth it

6263.04 --> 6268.38
to have a few tricks in being able to

6265.38 --> 6271.08
program I mean I like the idea of being

6268.38 --> 6275.119
able to program

6271.08 --> 6275.119
but to get to that point you see

6278.719 --> 6283.679
I did try it for a bit like on my

6281.28 --> 6286.139
commodore 64.

6283.679 --> 6288.9
but I did not get too far when things

6286.139 --> 6290.76
got too complicated I was like I don't

6288.9 --> 6292.619
understand this can you help brother

6290.76 --> 6294.179
because he knew more about it but then

6292.619 --> 6298.58
eventually he just didn't want to help

6294.179 --> 6298.58
me out anymore so then I stopped

6301.44 --> 6306.9
my brother did actually become a

6303.659 --> 6310.08
professional programmer you know

6306.9 --> 6314.9
but he quit like a decade ago why

6310.08 --> 6314.9
because he absolutely hated it

6316.32 --> 6321.84
he liked programming he didn't like the

6320.699 --> 6323.5199999999995
profession

6321.84 --> 6326.58
because

6323.52 --> 6329.219
he's like almost never was actually a

6326.58 --> 6331.32
capable of just doing it right

6329.219 --> 6333.9800000000005
he would always be sent out for stupid

6331.32 --> 6333.98
patchwork

6334.5 --> 6338.94
it's like you have to make this right

6337.679 --> 6341.52
and it's like

6338.94 --> 6343.138999999999
like a really he was a good programmer

6341.52 --> 6346.26
in what he does

6343.139 --> 6348.3
just because of yeah just because the

6346.26 --> 6350.1
honor that he felt about doing it right

6348.3 --> 6351.719
he's like this real programming with

6350.1 --> 6353.9400000000005
this concept like you have to do it

6351.719 --> 6357.36
right you have to have durable type of

6353.94 --> 6360.599999999999
code that's that's not gonna like get in

6357.36 --> 6363.179
the way later on very

6360.6 --> 6365.820000000001
very strategic in his thinking about

6363.179 --> 6367.8
programming but in the work that he got

6365.82 --> 6369.9
and he tried all kinds of things it

6367.8 --> 6373.5
would always end up just getting stupid

6369.9 --> 6376.92
company policy ruining it

6373.5 --> 6379.92
and he got so fed up with that [ __ ] that

6376.92 --> 6382.5
he quit eventually even though he he had

6379.92 --> 6385.56
a big paycheck at the time

6382.5 --> 6388.5
like pretty big like being a programmer

6385.56 --> 6391.26
a serious professional programmer in the

6388.5 --> 6394.26
90s that was the [ __ ] dude you got the

6391.26 --> 6396.2390000000005
score he got a lot of money from that

6394.26 --> 6397.92
he wasn't a millionaire or anything but

6396.239 --> 6400.32
he he got like

6397.92 --> 6402.5
three four times the normal type of

6400.32 --> 6402.5
check

6403.26 --> 6406.860000000001
and he did get like a penis car and all

6405.42 --> 6409.5
that and he

6406.86 --> 6411.0599999999995
going out skiing vacations because of

6409.5 --> 6414.199
that

6411.06 --> 6414.1990000000005
and he has a family

6414.84 --> 6420.179
right but he hated it because

6418.02 --> 6422.159000000001
programming like the professional

6420.179 --> 6423.179
programs just hell

6422.159 --> 6425.699
it's like

6423.179 --> 6427.619
it's like hell you got this skill and

6425.699 --> 6429.78
you could just never do it right you

6427.619 --> 6432.299999999999
always just set out to just make a mess

6429.78 --> 6433.5
and it's like nobody even cares if you

6432.3 --> 6436.1
make a mess

6433.5 --> 6436.1
terrible

6436.679 --> 6442.139
like people are hired as programmers

6439.38 --> 6445.02
that are like utterly incompetent and

6442.139 --> 6447.78
nobody [ __ ] does anything about it

6445.02 --> 6450.179
like neglect was a real theme that

6447.78 --> 6451.619
surrounded him and he got just super

6450.179 --> 6453.36
sick of it

6451.619 --> 6455.88
so yeah there's a bit of background on

6453.36 --> 6458.48
that not too eager to become a

6455.88 --> 6458.4800000000005
programmer

6458.88 --> 6467.06
I know somebody that tried and went for

6463.32 --> 6467.0599999999995
that and quit

6468.6 --> 6474.179
like

6470.639 --> 6476.28
quit after what is it

6474.179 --> 6479.36
yeah within two decades because it just

6476.28 --> 6479.36
got so sick of it

6482.159 --> 6486.599999999999
and the freaking programming language

6484.38 --> 6489.659000000001
continually change and all that [ __ ]

6486.6 --> 6492.119000000001
anyway so it's like

6489.659 --> 6494.4
you have two if you want to stay up to

6492.119 --> 6497.28
date with the newest thing you

6494.4 --> 6499.58
continually have to relearn all that

6497.28 --> 6499.58
[ __ ]

6501.36 --> 6506.339999999999
and that's always easier for a younger

6504.0 --> 6508.199
generation than somebody that's been a

6506.34 --> 6510.4800000000005
programmer for very long

6508.199 --> 6511.739
because they already got habits and ways

6510.48 --> 6514.799999999999
of programming

6511.739 --> 6516.239
getting good at it newer Generations

6514.8 --> 6518.159000000001
that he's gonna like I'm gonna program

6516.239 --> 6519.9
this they're like oh this is just the

6518.159 --> 6522.36
first language I'm trying and so they'll

6519.9 --> 6524.638999999999
be completely easily adapted to that

6522.36 --> 6527.46
it'll be much better at it

6524.639 --> 6529.7390000000005
than an old programmer trying to now

6527.46 --> 6531.78
newly learn a new language

6529.739 --> 6533.879999999999
unless they're just a freaking genius

6531.78 --> 6536.4
that just like oh yeah they're just a

6533.88 --> 6538.26
new language sure

6536.4 --> 6542.36
if you're actually a savant like that

6538.26 --> 6542.360000000001
yeah then it's not really a big deal but

6544.139 --> 6549.3
most people are not

6547.38 --> 6552.0
so programmers

6549.3 --> 6554.159000000001
unless you're a freaking Savant you're

6552.0 --> 6556.34
gonna just get really sick of it at some

6554.159 --> 6556.339999999999
point

6557.219 --> 6560.96
gonna be too tough to keep up

6564.92 --> 6569.28
like making less now than ever well

6567.3 --> 6571.02
there's that I guess I didn't even know

6569.28 --> 6573.38
that but yeah that makes sense Mark

6571.02 --> 6573.38
color

6577.199 --> 6580.259999999999
but

6578.219 --> 6581.52
it is kind of true isn't it just look

6580.26 --> 6583.92
look at

6581.52 --> 6586.92
the earlier stage of computer Revolution

6583.92 --> 6590.4
and 90s and even early 2000s it was like

6586.92 --> 6594.179
there's so much ideas on what you could

6590.4 --> 6597.599999999999
do with computer programs and games and

6594.179 --> 6599.88
then interfaces all luxurious futuristic

6597.6 --> 6601.7390000000005
interfaces it was so the chip remember

6599.88 --> 6603.900000000001
that remember when we all felt like

6601.739 --> 6606.48
that's like oh man yeah it's coming it's

6603.9 --> 6608.759999999999
coming it's gonna be the future age

6606.48 --> 6611.4
but now

6608.76 --> 6613.9800000000005
all of that [ __ ] has kind of been rolled

6611.4 --> 6616.44
out and is now standardized continually

6613.98 --> 6619.259999999999
getting in your face and it turns out

6616.44 --> 6623.099999999999
it's [ __ ] hell

6619.26 --> 6624.900000000001
it wasn't the good cool future of the

6623.1 --> 6627.54
luxury and

6624.9 --> 6630.48
and just like happiness and Tranquility

6627.54 --> 6634.26
no no it's [ __ ] hell Beast continue

6630.48 --> 6637.32
like ah [ __ ] you up yeah yeah the

6634.26 --> 6639.84
turnout that the programming did not

6637.32 --> 6642.239
lead to that idyllic future that we all

6639.84 --> 6644.58
hoped for back then

6642.239 --> 6647.699
so it's not no wonder that programming

6644.58 --> 6648.719
is getting paid for Less look at all the

6647.699 --> 6652.699
crap

6648.719 --> 6652.699
that's actually been produced by them

6655.5 --> 6660.719
although that probably wasn't their

6657.9 --> 6663.78
initiative but still like

6660.719 --> 6668.28
a lot of programming is like programming

6663.78 --> 6670.86
crap that's there to invade you invade

6668.28 --> 6673.639
your mind or

6670.86 --> 6673.639
and yeah

6674.04 --> 6678.0199999999995
not good that's not good programming

6680.88 --> 6686.2390000000005
programming can still be great guys it

6683.219 --> 6686.2390000000005
can still be good

6688.679 --> 6694.58
if it's not hooked up to the beast

6690.78 --> 6699.199
machine if it's not just forcing you to

6694.58 --> 6699.199
standardized propaganda tricks and [ __ ]

6701.699 --> 6707.659
a shield missile

6704.4 --> 6707.659
there's no such thing

6713.1 --> 6717.6
I mean the best you could get out of a

6715.679 --> 6719.46
machine is an oracle function that's

6717.6 --> 6722.54
like the best you can get

6719.46 --> 6722.54
there's no Messiah

6723.179 --> 6729.6
there's no figuring out

6726.36 --> 6732.78
completely new things

6729.6 --> 6735.659000000001
like inventing new things a machine is

6732.78 --> 6737.82
not going to invent new things

6735.659 --> 6740.82
at best it can have an oversight over

6737.82 --> 6743.34
everything known and cataloged and then

6740.82 --> 6746.639
find new Solutions between those things

6743.34 --> 6750.360000000001
that have already been cataloged

6746.639 --> 6753.96
a machine can never eat from scratch

6750.36 --> 6758.0599999999995
develop a vision

6753.96 --> 6758.06
to figure out something new

6758.219 --> 6762.84
it's only ever going to combine things

6760.32 --> 6765.96
that have been handed to it and look at

6762.84 --> 6768.179
chat GPT that's already what it is that

6765.96 --> 6769.92
and it's really all it is it's all that

6768.179 --> 6772.7390000000005
AI I will ever be

6769.92 --> 6774.0
it can never surpass its own programming

6772.739 --> 6776.879999999999
you see

6774.0 --> 6780.06
this has been discussed in sci-fi in the

6776.88 --> 6782.46
20th century for crying out loud and

6780.06 --> 6784.92
it's right here we're in it now and it's

6782.46 --> 6788.82
happening like that

6784.92 --> 6791.36
the program can never as transcend its

6788.82 --> 6791.36
programming

6794.159 --> 6800.879999999999
it can never invent something that isn't

6797.76 --> 6802.38
composed of something that it was handed

6800.88 --> 6808.4400000000005
to it

6802.38 --> 6811.56
it can't do it it just can't do it by

6808.44 --> 6813.119
Nature no matter how complicated you

6811.56 --> 6815.820000000001
make the thing

6813.119 --> 6820.159
it will not be able to make something

6815.82 --> 6823.08
new only combine things

6820.159 --> 6825.839999999999
recombine things

6823.08 --> 6829.32
to a very sophisticated level

6825.84 --> 6833.219
of things that were already handed to it

6829.32 --> 6836.659
that's how it is it's how it will be

6833.219 --> 6836.659
it's not gonna change

6838.02 --> 6841.219
it was oh wow okay

6843.6 --> 6847.400000000001
don't kill this Messiah who knows man

6847.92 --> 6854.34
well there's definitely

6851.219 --> 6857.84
ideas of a homunculus Jesus

6854.34 --> 6857.84
might have already existed

6863.639 --> 6869.400000000001
but I mean I don't think they're like

6867.239 --> 6871.259999999999
seems because it seems so pointless like

6869.4 --> 6874.799999999999
why would they create like a living

6871.26 --> 6877.1990000000005
vessel that's supposed to embody some

6874.8 --> 6880.139
ruler or something

6877.199 --> 6882.178999999999
like serpenter in the GI Joe Series

6880.139 --> 6885.179
right

6882.179 --> 6887.639
why would you it seems all kind of

6885.179 --> 6893.1
pointless

6887.639 --> 6895.56
it would be more of a a theatric figure

6893.1 --> 6899.280000000001
than an actual

6895.56 --> 6901.820000000001
like superiority thing leader or

6899.28 --> 6901.82
whatever I mean

6901.86 --> 6908.42
it will be more of a symbol if they'd

6904.38 --> 6908.42
make like a homunculus figure like that

6923.239 --> 6927.718999999999
AI should never be allowed to make

6925.5 --> 6930.179
important decisions

6927.719 --> 6932.699
you would be surprised at how well it

6930.179 --> 6937.26
can actually do that though more colored

6932.699 --> 6939.419999999999
you know why because you can give the

6937.26 --> 6940.5
parameters

6939.42 --> 6942.119
to

6940.5 --> 6944.88
the AI

6942.119 --> 6948.179
and it really can then with those

6944.88 --> 6951.2390000000005
parameters if programmed correctly make

6948.179 --> 6954.2390000000005
a very very perfectly weighed decision

6951.239 --> 6956.159
on it so you'd be surprised at how good

6954.239 --> 6958.799999999999
AI are actually

6956.159 --> 6960.48
in making important decisions

6958.8 --> 6963.0
but only

6960.48 --> 6966.0599999999995
only if you give it the correct

6963.0 --> 6968.219
parameters the morality of how the

6966.06 --> 6970.679
decision making happens all of that has

6968.219 --> 6973.56
to be given to it it has to be

6970.679 --> 6976.56
programmed into it to be like that and

6973.56 --> 6978.780000000001
then it can do it very eloquently like

6976.56 --> 6981.119000000001
every time it can have like a peak

6978.78 --> 6981.96
inside performance every second it's

6981.119 --> 6984.719
used

6981.96 --> 6986.88
while a person that can do that might

6984.719 --> 6988.8
have that naturally but they also have

6986.88 --> 6991.8
bad days where they can't do it like

6988.8 --> 6994.38
that so you'd be surprised at how well

6991.8 --> 6995.820000000001
AI would actually function in such

6994.38 --> 6999.86
things

6995.82 --> 6999.86
if it's programmed properly

7000.8 --> 7007.2390000000005
by highly moral High intellect

7007.94 --> 7011.9
if that's not the case you're [ __ ]

7010.28 --> 7014.259999999999
it's just going to be a butcher machine

7011.9 --> 7014.259999999999
then

7019.28 --> 7025.4
I want

7021.56 --> 7025.400000000001
tars wow

7026.42 --> 7030.32
cars

7028.159 --> 7033.739
what do you

7030.32 --> 7036.98
oh tars right like the yeah

7033.739 --> 7039.259999999999
yeah the flexible programmable machine I

7036.98 --> 7041.0599999999995
know tar is just freaking amazing I mean

7039.26 --> 7044.2390000000005
that was like the best

7041.06 --> 7046.400000000001
that was the good side of AI

7044.239 --> 7048.44
it was the first movie that actually

7046.4 --> 7051.379999999999
almost made me cry for a bit because

7048.44 --> 7053.659
it's like all the AIS all evil and

7051.38 --> 7058.28
that's like now that's how you [ __ ]

7053.659 --> 7064.719
do it tars that's that's the real future

7058.28 --> 7064.719
of AI the the durable future of AI

7064.76 --> 7070.6990000000005
and Robotics that was so good so yeah I

7068.48 --> 7072.739
agree with you there Jared

7070.699 --> 7075.339999999999
humor level

7072.739 --> 7075.339999999999
yeah yeah

7075.8 --> 7078.9400000000005
that was a nice touch

7088.82 --> 7094.179
yes that is pretty much what it is yes

7106.82 --> 7110.42
so

7108.38 --> 7113.599
what I could do

7110.42 --> 7116.119
is make a program flow chart

7113.599 --> 7119.0
I've seen my brother do that

7116.119 --> 7122.119
and I really get how it works it's all

7119.0 --> 7123.86
about modules and triggers from one

7122.119 --> 7126.5
module to another so you have a bunch of

7123.86 --> 7129.199
bubbles so you have a bunch of lines and

7126.5 --> 7131.36
then conditions for that to activate and

7129.199 --> 7135.379999999999
that's like that's a program that's what

7131.36 --> 7138.139
it I know how a program works I can make

7135.38 --> 7140.719
a flowchart for a program

7138.139 --> 7142.58
I just don't know how to program and I

7140.719 --> 7145.04
don't know like the mechanical

7142.58 --> 7147.32
complicated mechanisms within

7145.04 --> 7148.94
programming that can be used that really

7147.32 --> 7153.4
programmers has to have the best

7148.94 --> 7157.28
oversight for but I know how a program

7153.4 --> 7159.739
works and how you can design a program

7157.28 --> 7162.5599999999995
how you can expand the program because I

7159.739 --> 7164.718999999999
did some of that it was Commodore basic

7162.56 --> 7167.96
but I mean even though it was barely

7164.719 --> 7170.119
having any serious content within it I

7167.96 --> 7172.82
was still able to play with it make it

7170.119 --> 7176.0
work and then get that feel for like so

7172.82 --> 7179.599
this is what programming really is

7176.0 --> 7184.04
and what you just said LSG yeah that's

7179.599 --> 7186.139
that was among those first lessons that

7184.04 --> 7189.94
that I learned by figuring it out myself

7186.139 --> 7189.9400000000005
on a commodore 64.

7191.02 --> 7198.080000000001
right you need to know the language

7195.26 --> 7201.04
and you need to know the symbols on like

7198.08 --> 7201.04
what does what

7209.36 --> 7214.36
turns over a case

7211.699 --> 7214.36
what

7223.159 --> 7227.259999999999
I don't know what you're talking about

7224.54 --> 7227.26
now Jared

7238.159 --> 7243.199
hmm

7240.199 --> 7245.9
okay more colored interesting yeah but I

7243.199 --> 7249.08
mean I understand that there's plenty of

7245.9 --> 7251.659
cannabis can definitely make you can

7249.08 --> 7255.76
enhance paranoia sensation

7251.659 --> 7255.759999999999
in the beginning perhaps mentioned that

7256.28 --> 7262.46
it really does matter though like what

7259.46 --> 7264.199
your moral state is where you're at if

7262.46 --> 7267.5
you have like

7264.199 --> 7270.5599999999995
insecurities about your well-being or

7267.5 --> 7271.699
your livelihood then the paranoia does

7270.56 --> 7274.599
enhance

7271.699 --> 7274.598999999999
from cannabis

7276.08 --> 7281.0599999999995
especially if you try to use it as some

7278.48 --> 7283.459999999999
kind of relief drug

7281.06 --> 7285.7390000000005
from the stress of it it will actually

7283.46 --> 7288.7390000000005
like

7285.739 --> 7291.159
slap you with it that's what I've

7288.739 --> 7291.159
noticed

7300.38 --> 7306.9800000000005
yeah and the stronger it is the more the

7303.32 --> 7308.36
more Vivid the paranoia which by the way

7306.98 --> 7310.5199999999995
if it's strong enough you can literally

7308.36 --> 7312.699
like have moments of hallucination from

7310.52 --> 7312.6990000000005
that

7314.06 --> 7319.34
although that's usually reserved to like

7316.4 --> 7321.44
somebody that like never really smokes

7319.34 --> 7323.42
cannabis and then you suddenly give them

7321.44 --> 7325.699
like the super strong stuff

7323.42 --> 7327.8
well they will probably actually

7325.699 --> 7332.239
hallucinate them

7327.8 --> 7334.04
and it could do damage to them so don't

7332.239 --> 7337.04
don't do that

7334.04 --> 7341.679
don't do that to somebody

7337.04 --> 7341.679
that's that's almost assault

7344.42 --> 7349.76
like don't let a newbie or teen or

7347.9 --> 7351.98
something that's never really smoked or

7349.76 --> 7356.139
maybe maybe one time

7351.98 --> 7359.0599999999995
don't hand them your super super strong

7356.139 --> 7362.78
weaponized DHE joint I mean that's

7359.06 --> 7365.26
that's like assault don't do that never

7362.78 --> 7365.259999999999
do that

7370.94 --> 7376.5199999999995
like even if they get articulous I could

7374.179 --> 7378.02
take a joke don't don't [ __ ] do that

7376.52 --> 7380.599
yeah you don't

7378.02 --> 7384.040000000001
hand somebody got a gun to play Russian

7380.599 --> 7384.04
Roulette you just don't do that

7392.0 --> 7396.32
if I had that kind of cannabis I I

7394.28 --> 7398.179
wouldn't even like smoke it among other

7396.32 --> 7399.739
people I wouldn't

7398.179 --> 7402.679
it's like

7399.739 --> 7404.598999999999
because yeah but not that I smoke it but

7402.679 --> 7405.9800000000005
if I do that I wouldn't even do it

7404.599 --> 7408.679
public that's like

7405.98 --> 7410.959999999999
taking hard drugs in public

7408.679 --> 7413.38
because it is almost like hard drugs

7410.96 --> 7413.38
that stuff

7414.139 --> 7419.179
it's not really medicinal anymore

7417.139 --> 7421.28
there's just kind of drugs it's just

7419.179 --> 7424.119
drugs

7421.28 --> 7424.119
yeah anyway

7424.639 --> 7429.6990000000005
all this talk all the drugs is not good

7430.76 --> 7435.639
but there are things to learn about it

7435.679 --> 7441.9400000000005
so I guess that bringing it up as a

7437.9 --> 7441.94
subject every now and then is not bad

7450.8 --> 7456.02
athletic yeah CBD is awesome stuff you

7454.159 --> 7457.339999999999
don't really feel it too much but I mean

7456.02 --> 7459.92
it

7457.34 --> 7464.139
it helps for many things it helps also

7459.92 --> 7467.3
for like uh what do you call it

7464.139 --> 7469.34
epileptic being epileptic

7467.3 --> 7472.09
inflammation

7469.34 --> 7475.27
overall brain health

7472.09 --> 7475.27
[Music]

7476.9 --> 7480.799999999999
it's really good for your entire fat

7479.06 --> 7484.34
system

7480.8 --> 7486.5
and hey your brain is like a lot of fat

7484.34 --> 7493.0
most of your nerves

7486.5 --> 7493.0
are really dependent on fat in many ways

7493.099 --> 7499.42
and CBD is fat soluble it really fixes

7497.06 --> 7499.42
that

7503.119 --> 7509.739
so yeah CBD

7506.199 --> 7509.739
very healthy product

7513.98 --> 7518.659
and I personally haven't actually tried

7516.679 --> 7521.719
it yet because it's a freaking expensive

7518.659 --> 7524.0
but I really do want to it's just that

7521.719 --> 7526.4
it's so expensive that the threshold for

7524.0 --> 7527.78
actually trying it out personally one

7526.4 --> 7529.879999999999
time

7527.78 --> 7531.5199999999995
it's just this too high right now

7529.88 --> 7534.619
because I'm like

7531.52 --> 7537.52
yeah I'm not gonna like spend a hundred

7534.619 --> 7541.04
euros to try something

7537.52 --> 7543.400000000001
when I can barely get around getting

7541.04 --> 7543.4
food

7545.96 --> 7552.76
but it's like on the to try list but I

7549.08 --> 7552.76
am very confident that it is good

7553.28 --> 7560.0
it's a well-developed product by now and

7556.94 --> 7561.799999999999
lots of really good doctors do recommend

7560.0 --> 7564.08
it

7561.8 --> 7566.599
which I'm happy about because 10 years

7564.08 --> 7568.94
ago we were nobody was really sure that

7566.599 --> 7571.159000000001
it would be able to become kind of

7568.94 --> 7573.379999999999
standardized

7571.159 --> 7576.619
at first did you know that at first it

7573.38 --> 7578.3
was just all denial everything about CBD

7576.619 --> 7580.639
and all it was denied

7578.3 --> 7583.58
it's like no go away

7580.639 --> 7586.52
take the vaccine instead right there was

7583.58 --> 7589.28
that the medical industry's attitude

7586.52 --> 7592.46
so it was all like yeah yeah yeah CBD no

7589.28 --> 7595.4
no no it's still drunk uh no you can't

7592.46 --> 7597.9800000000005
but now it's like no it is kind of

7595.4 --> 7599.659
recognized as like this isn't a valuable

7597.98 --> 7601.699
modern

7599.659 --> 7603.32
food supplement stuff and it's really

7601.699 --> 7606.259999999999
healthy

7603.32 --> 7608.619
and holistic doctors will recommend it

7606.26 --> 7608.619000000001
to you

7610.639 --> 7616.42
and it's a product that you you can

7613.219 --> 7616.42
actually just find

7617.179 --> 7623.4800000000005
it's like only one step away and

7621.139 --> 7626.119
I kind of hope that at some point I'll

7623.48 --> 7629.598999999999
find just a little bottle of CBD oil

7626.119 --> 7631.339999999999
like in the middle of the aisle of food

7629.599 --> 7633.5
supplements

7631.34 --> 7636.4400000000005
in this in the organic grocery store

7633.5 --> 7638.96
right where I get my my pills and

7636.44 --> 7641.54
and all that stuff

7638.96 --> 7643.4
food supplements I really hope that just

7641.54 --> 7645.44
one day find that cvd is just

7643.4 --> 7649.04
standardized as a food supplement that

7645.44 --> 7651.08
is everywhere now that would be then it

7649.04 --> 7653.239
would be complete

7651.08 --> 7657.26
because it is one of those substances

7653.239 --> 7660.86
that is like really miraculous

7657.26 --> 7662.54
do you realize that this there's good

7660.86 --> 7663.86
lead and what I'm gonna say now is

7662.54 --> 7667.699
absolutely true

7663.86 --> 7670.339999999999
that the word anointed

7667.699 --> 7672.619
right you know the anointed one it was

7670.34 --> 7675.7390000000005
like a terminology used

7672.619 --> 7677.299999999999
related to like the the priesthood of

7675.739 --> 7678.86
the middle Medieval Times Catholic

7677.3 --> 7683.320000000001
priesthood also

7678.86 --> 7686.0599999999995
practices like you would be uh at a

7683.32 --> 7687.92
enlightened insight you would be

7686.06 --> 7690.139
anointed well where did it come from it

7687.92 --> 7693.6990000000005
became from the practice

7690.139 --> 7693.6990000000005
of taking oil

7694.159 --> 7698.36
that oil like olive oil or something

7696.38 --> 7701.900000000001
that they would make already

7698.36 --> 7704.78
then dissolving herbs in it among which

7701.9 --> 7708.199
would be cannabis

7704.78 --> 7711.5599999999995
yeah and then they put that oil

7708.199 --> 7714.86
on their heads that would be anointing

7711.56 --> 7718.820000000001
then you'd have like you'd absorb

7714.86 --> 7721.219
the herbs through the oil and

7718.82 --> 7722.96
would have a very healthy influence on

7721.219 --> 7725.8
you that's where they got anointing from

7722.96 --> 7730.82
it was from cannabis oil

7725.8 --> 7733.639
really yeah cannabis and probably other

7730.82 --> 7735.44
things like mushrooms and stuff but

7733.639 --> 7738.26
definitely cannabis

7735.44 --> 7739.54
and that's like recorded historically

7738.26 --> 7742.159000000001
like

7739.54 --> 7743.9
really old people like their

7742.159 --> 7746.719
Mesopotamians

7743.9 --> 7749.48
I think the Mesopotamians actually have

7746.719 --> 7750.44
been recorded to to have to use cannabis

7749.48 --> 7753.379999999999
oil

7750.44 --> 7756.739
I might might have the wrong group there

7753.38 --> 7759.1990000000005
but it's really old like it's

7756.739 --> 7761.299999999999
archaically oh I think the Babylonians

7759.199 --> 7762.739
use cannabis oil

7761.3 --> 7765.8
even

7762.739 --> 7767.419999999999
like it's very very old and it's very

7765.8 --> 7769.219
standard and it was kind of

7767.42 --> 7771.9800000000005
de-standardized

7769.219 --> 7774.32
in the 20th century because of like

7771.98 --> 7777.0199999999995
bereave for madness and [ __ ] because

7774.32 --> 7781.04
before that in the early 20th century

7777.02 --> 7783.92
there was cannabis oil like every

7781.04 --> 7788.08
uh every farmer

7783.92 --> 7788.08
every Farm I shop at it

7788.719 --> 7795.5
they also had like cocaine stuff and

7792.5 --> 7797.719
like they had all kinds of drugs

7795.5 --> 7800.42
in at the Pharma and the pharmacist

7797.719 --> 7804.26
because it wasn't really illegal

7800.42 --> 7807.679
but yeah cannabis oil was kind of

7804.26 --> 7811.46
standard like for a very long time even

7807.679 --> 7812.719
in the west very standard

7811.46 --> 7815.54
like

7812.719 --> 7817.58
you go to the doctor there's a you have

7815.54 --> 7819.26
certain issues he will give you this oil

7817.58 --> 7821.0599999999995
and you wouldn't even know that it's

7819.26 --> 7822.5
kind of sauce just take this oil this

7821.06 --> 7825.679
works

7822.5 --> 7828.619
just take a spoon of that every day

7825.679 --> 7830.2390000000005
and people will be like okay and it

7828.619 --> 7832.339999999999
would work and they wouldn't even know

7830.239 --> 7834.678999999999
it's like cannabis like

7832.34 --> 7835.400000000001
just I know doctor just told me to take

7834.679 --> 7837.9800000000005
this

7835.4 --> 7842.0599999999995
it was so standard guys

7837.98 --> 7844.58
cannabis oil was super standard

7842.06 --> 7848.179
in the West

7844.58 --> 7851.179
is like on the side medicine

7848.179 --> 7853.719
before the Rockefeller Foundation red

7851.179 --> 7856.88
car cross

7853.719 --> 7859.159
allopathic Universal medical system

7856.88 --> 7860.56
started rolling all right they were the

7859.159 --> 7863.0599999999995
ones partially

7860.56 --> 7866.54
mostly responsible

7863.06 --> 7868.04
for getting all that [ __ ] banned and out

7866.54 --> 7870.739
of the way

7868.04 --> 7873.32
for making all that stuff illegal so

7870.739 --> 7877.82
that you'd have to use their chemical

7873.32 --> 7881.54
Pharma instead they did that they took

7877.82 --> 7882.619
it away and now after a century we got

7881.54 --> 7886.28
it back

7882.619 --> 7889.339999999999
we got the cannabis oil backward belongs

7886.28 --> 7891.8
on the medical cabinet

7889.34 --> 7893.659000000001
and I'm really happy about that and I

7891.8 --> 7895.820000000001
hope that at some point it will

7893.659 --> 7899.659
literally be in between my food

7895.82 --> 7902.0
supplements at the grocery store if when

7899.659 --> 7905.0
that happens it's complete

7902.0 --> 7905.0
foreign

7908.38 --> 7914.4800000000005
we can we can definitely have healthy

7912.26 --> 7917.83
naturally grown easily grown products

7914.48 --> 7919.339999999999
for labs we can definitely do that

7917.83 --> 7922.94
[Music]

7919.34 --> 7925.58
the Medici family what

7922.94 --> 7928.5199999999995
cannabis based beer recipes ancient

7925.58 --> 7930.8
Samaria oh talking about

7928.52 --> 7932.540000000001
I recently they're in the homunculus

7930.8 --> 7934.58
video remember anybody that saw that

7932.54 --> 7936.699
video the long one

7934.58 --> 7939.619
now I'm gonna kill this video remember

7936.699 --> 7942.86
the Templars

7939.619 --> 7946.88
had a cannabis wine

7942.86 --> 7949.82
they called it the nectar of Jerusalem

7946.88 --> 7951.400000000001
they had a cannabis one that's like a

7949.82 --> 7954.86
very famous group

7951.4 --> 7957.4
they had it so yes everywhere it's

7954.86 --> 7957.4
everywhere

7962.48 --> 7969.44
yeah and dude there's a reason why the

7965.9 --> 7974.138999999999
Rastafari consider cannabis a

7969.44 --> 7974.138999999999
holy herb a herb of Christ

7975.8 --> 7981.400000000001
I I respect that actually I respect that

7978.98 --> 7981.4
belief

7987.079 --> 7991.94
it's partially the reason why I'm not

7989.84 --> 7994.639
like always like oh my God I gotta get

7991.94 --> 7996.619
off this cannabis sometime I really

7994.639 --> 8000.46
gotta get off it because I don't feel

7996.619 --> 8003.098999999999
like that I don't feel bad about it

8000.46 --> 8005.679
I have that issue more with the tobacco

8003.099 --> 8008.6990000000005
actually than I have with the cannabis

8005.679 --> 8011.02
but it's also because of I mean it's

8008.699 --> 8015.4
pre-fackaged tobacco

8011.02 --> 8018.46
of that cleaner type but still

8015.4 --> 8021.04
if I just had the original dried leaves

8018.46 --> 8023.699
that I would cut myself I'd feel a lot

8021.04 --> 8023.699
better about it

8024.699 --> 8027.699
foreign

8031.92 --> 8036.78
yeah

8033.48 --> 8036.78
it could be

8040.079 --> 8046.5
reach me oh God Marco you didn't see

8042.699 --> 8050.4
that one the homunculus video from

8046.5 --> 8050.4
uh what's it called again

8051.219 --> 8054.9
where did I post that thing

8056.56 --> 8061.619000000001
[ __ ]

8059.02 --> 8061.619000000001
laughs

8064.199 --> 8067.799999999999
what's it called again

8072.34 --> 8077.139
damn it I have so many channels I'm

8074.56 --> 8079.9800000000005
subscribed to it's like it takes ages to

8077.139 --> 8079.9800000000005
scroll for that

8092.139 --> 8096.54
where I said where is it where is it

8094.0 --> 8096.54
where is it

8104.76 --> 8108.84
come on where are you

8115.199 --> 8118.5
damn it

8128.079 --> 8135.239
I hate it when I just can't find

8130.179 --> 8135.2390000000005
something in a limited size list

8136.719 --> 8140.34
all right

8137.86 --> 8140.339999999999
what is it

8145.599 --> 8148.38
crap

8148.96 --> 8151.9800000000005
does anybody remember

8165.94 --> 8171.219
does anybody remember the link

8169.0 --> 8173.679
I mean it's been like a month now since

8171.219 --> 8175.36
I last brought that up

8173.679 --> 8179.46
I mean it's gonna be one hell of a

8175.36 --> 8179.46
scroll trying to find that back in Skype

8194.8 --> 8199.539999999999
I just remembered the name of the

8197.019 --> 8202.800000000001
channel that would have been great ah

8199.54 --> 8206.519
yeah I got it I found it

8202.8 --> 8206.518999999998
scrolled back a whole bunch

8209.2 --> 8212.92
found it in

8210.519 --> 8216.0
the trailer so here it is this is the

8212.92 --> 8216.0
homunculus video

8223.359 --> 8227.5
oh and it's time stamped it's not

8225.7 --> 8230.380000000001
supposed to be timestamp yeah mind

8227.5 --> 8232.54
unveiled that was it

8230.38 --> 8236.699999999999
let me repost that without a stupid

8232.54 --> 8236.7
thing why does it always [ __ ] do it

8238.08 --> 8243.88
all right

8240.359 --> 8248.62
so here it is non-time stamp

8243.88 --> 8251.139
but yeah it is a massive video

8248.62 --> 8252.519
so you're probably not gonna watch it in

8251.139 --> 8255.58
one sitting

8252.519 --> 8257.939
because nobody ever does that 10 hours

8255.58 --> 8257.939
straight

8259.359 --> 8264.12
it took me like a week to watch the

8261.639 --> 8264.119999999999
entire thing

8265.599 --> 8270.099
now a week

8268.12 --> 8272.5
eventually when I really got into it I

8270.099 --> 8277.08
did get through it pretty quickly

8272.5 --> 8277.08
it's like watching for two hours a day

8282.82 --> 8288.76
but there's I mean it is

8285.219 --> 8290.438999999998
it is like the Alchemy complete works my

8288.76 --> 8292.66
caller that it's pretty much the video

8290.439 --> 8295.66
that is like a complete works of like

8292.66 --> 8298.8
the most obscure Alchemy

8295.66 --> 8298.8
Secrets out there

8302.08 --> 8305.7
and there's definitely things that are

8303.939 --> 8308.5
being described there

8305.7 --> 8310.240000000002
that it's not the first time I've heard

8308.5 --> 8313.479
of that

8310.24 --> 8318.099
people that were into that told me

8313.479 --> 8320.679
things that I heard in that video

8318.099 --> 8322.78
which tells me like this is real this is

8320.679 --> 8325.719000000001
real because I've heard things from

8322.78 --> 8328.800000000001
actual Alchemist people

8325.719 --> 8328.8
telling me that

8337.12 --> 8342.7
how Superman was crafted after the Golem

8340.359 --> 8346.2
what

8342.7 --> 8346.2
what what are you talking about

8347.139 --> 8349.438999999998
what

8361.24 --> 8365.46
takes lots of nitrogen to grow yeah yeah

8366.639 --> 8370.839999999998
which is kind of ridiculous isn't it

8369.099 --> 8374.32
George Sanford that here in my country

8370.84 --> 8374.32
is like nitrogen

8374.5 --> 8378.639
well

8375.939 --> 8380.380000000001
if nitrogen is such a problem and you

8378.639 --> 8383.38
need to get rid of it

8380.38 --> 8385.779999999999
then just grow hemp just grow a lot of

8383.38 --> 8386.979
hemp it'll suck up the nitrogen like

8385.78 --> 8392.640000000001
crazy

8386.979 --> 8392.64
can dump all your excess nitrogen there

8396.64 --> 8402.399
the Golem you mean a Golem

8399.76 --> 8403.74
Gollum is the creature from Lord of the

8402.399 --> 8407.74
Rings

8403.74 --> 8409.18
I think you're you mean the Golem from

8407.74 --> 8412.02
Jewish

8409.18 --> 8412.02
lore

8417.88 --> 8423.0
nitrogen 79 yeah yeah there's that

8440.399 --> 8444.06
interesting work colored

8450.399 --> 8454.899
soil depletion is mono crop yes yes you

8454.0 --> 8457.6
need

8454.899 --> 8460.42
what I learned very early on

8457.6 --> 8464.5
was that all these types of plants that

8460.42 --> 8466.66
pop up on the field pop up for a reason

8464.5 --> 8469.3
it's like all these different types of

8466.66 --> 8471.52
wild herbs and stuff

8469.3 --> 8474.46
which is considered weeds that should be

8471.52 --> 8476.859
pulled out and all that they all like

8474.46 --> 8478.899
are have their different contract layers

8476.859 --> 8481.0
they're all like laborers getting into

8478.899 --> 8482.8
that raw soil it's like

8481.0 --> 8486.46
yeah it's missing that and that and that

8482.8 --> 8488.979
oh okay so then it's our turn we are we

8486.46 --> 8491.319
are okay with that depletion they'll get

8488.979 --> 8493.66
in there then suddenly oh that's one

8491.319 --> 8495.46
type of herb starts popping up and they

8493.66 --> 8499.18
do their stuff

8495.46 --> 8501.399
right like for example nettle

8499.18 --> 8502.960000000001
like the stingy Neville that makes it

8501.399 --> 8504.88
feel like you've been bitten by mosquito

8502.96 --> 8509.019999999999
very annoying plant you don't want to

8504.88 --> 8511.24
fall in a pile of nettles like that but

8509.02 --> 8514.0
Nettles you can actually make soup of it

8511.24 --> 8516.34
that's kind of healthy I heard my

8514.0 --> 8518.859
parents used to do that in the Old Farm

8516.34 --> 8520.66
of my grandmas where there were a lot of

8518.859 --> 8524.140000000001
nails we had a forest full of nettles

8520.66 --> 8526.78
there all right the adventure but

8524.14 --> 8529.899
what it does is the Neville pops up and

8526.78 --> 8533.08
it enriches the soil it actually creates

8529.899 --> 8536.08
nitrogen did you know that

8533.08 --> 8539.5
it's like you don't have any cows

8536.08 --> 8542.08
just let the bull get overrun by Nettles

8539.5 --> 8543.16
yes it's [ __ ] annoying because they

8542.08 --> 8547.66
sting

8543.16 --> 8549.16
but they really enrich the ground

8547.66 --> 8550.899
and then after they're kind of done

8549.16 --> 8553.08
they'll stop growing there and this

8550.899 --> 8557.279999999999
keeps happening

8553.08 --> 8557.28
electroculture no I've not heard of that

8558.399 --> 8562.3
dandelions were in calcium cool

8561.22 --> 8564.279999999999
see

8562.3 --> 8568.019999999999
but that isn't that amazing it's like

8564.28 --> 8570.640000000001
all these types of wild weeds are like

8568.02 --> 8572.74
contractors they're they are literally

8570.64 --> 8574.779999999999
Nature's contractors

8572.74 --> 8577.18
the seeds and stuff they all blow around

8574.78 --> 8578.74
like crazy and if they hit a patch of

8577.18 --> 8580.54
soil that's like oh

8578.74 --> 8583.359
depleted of this and that and that and

8580.54 --> 8585.460000000001
they're like oh that's our cue and they

8583.359 --> 8587.08
start growing there it's like yeah this

8585.46 --> 8589.3
is perfect for us nothing else is going

8587.08 --> 8591.7
to grow here but us

8589.3 --> 8593.619999999999
until they've basically transformed the

8591.7 --> 8596.62
ground and then they're gonna be like

8593.62 --> 8598.78
okay they're gonna be less enthusiastic

8596.62 --> 8602.140000000001
maybe die out and then another plant

8598.78 --> 8604.479000000001
will be oh oh you this got this and that

8602.14 --> 8606.58
and that in there okay now it's our turn

8604.479 --> 8608.438999999998
and then they'll start to overtake it

8606.58 --> 8610.42
and so there's like

8608.439 --> 8612.52
this natural

8610.42 --> 8616.359
cycle

8612.52 --> 8619.359
of all these weeds that just make the

8616.359 --> 8621.880000000001
soil great again

8619.359 --> 8625.380000000001
it's so amazing how that works how

8621.88 --> 8625.38
nature just does that

8625.78 --> 8632.939
but yeah if you continue monoculture you

8629.02 --> 8635.800000000001
don't let the ground rest

8632.939 --> 8638.5
refertilize itself you just pour

8635.8 --> 8640.84
fermented [ __ ] on it all the time and

8638.5 --> 8643.0
you keep growing the same crop

8640.84 --> 8645.819
same thing over and over again all the

8643.0 --> 8647.62
time every year yeah then it's gonna

8645.819 --> 8649.479
deplete to the point where it's going to

8647.62 --> 8651.18
collapse

8649.479 --> 8654.88
then eventually

8651.18 --> 8657.04
it will be a lot longer a road for that

8654.88 --> 8659.8
ground to recover

8657.04 --> 8662.5
you'd have to like lay it have it bare

8659.8 --> 8665.619999999999
for years and then just let all the

8662.5 --> 8667.96
weeds do it continually you won't be it

8665.62 --> 8670.300000000001
depletes if you do monoculture but if

8667.96 --> 8674.199999999999
you do crop rotation system which the

8670.3 --> 8678.64
even the medieval Farmers you used to do

8674.2 --> 8681.880000000001
just take three pieces of land

8678.64 --> 8685.119999999999
one piece you grow your crops

8681.88 --> 8688.119999999999
the other you lay it there

8685.12 --> 8691.42
and then the third which was Bare before

8688.12 --> 8693.42
that you let the cows eat it

8691.42 --> 8697.18
right so you get

8693.42 --> 8700.18
crops ground depleted you let

8697.18 --> 8703.0
it grow wild again grass starts to grow

8700.18 --> 8706.24
plants starts to grow you let the cows

8703.0 --> 8708.939
eat it all they [ __ ] it out it adds even

8706.24 --> 8712.68
more fertilizer and there you go you got

8708.939 --> 8712.68
perfectly further ground again

8712.78 --> 8716.1
that's crop rotation

8716.439 --> 8720.54
they used to do that in medieval times

8720.939 --> 8725.979000000001
and Farmers had to like fight for the

8723.76 --> 8727.300000000001
ability to do that because Lorax runs

8725.979 --> 8729.16
like no more production production

8727.3 --> 8731.319
production of course they won because

8729.16 --> 8733.479
they just want more profit and more and

8731.319 --> 8735.34
more and more for their armies they

8733.479 --> 8737.619999999999
would try to push Farmers like no you

8735.34 --> 8739.42
gotta do this you gotta do this and the

8737.62 --> 8742.960000000001
Farms would be like no

8739.42 --> 8745.06
because if we do this then next year

8742.96 --> 8747.599999999999
there will be no food and there will be

8745.06 --> 8747.6
starvation

8751.0 --> 8756.72
so like Farmers actually had to take

8753.46 --> 8759.46
risks at times saying no to the Lord

8756.72 --> 8763.619999999999
just to prevent their farm from

8759.46 --> 8763.619999999999
collapsing due to overgrowing

8763.72 --> 8768.34
Farmers always had it pretty difficult

8766.0 --> 8770.979
like that they always had to fight

8768.34 --> 8773.380000000001
against the Beast

8770.979 --> 8775.619999999999
that was just so eager of ruining

8773.38 --> 8775.619999999999
everything

8786.34 --> 8790.479
plant complementary plants in with the

8788.5 --> 8792.52
corruption yeah you can do that

8790.479 --> 8796.24
if you're just a regular grower not

8792.52 --> 8798.460000000001
really like big crop farmer but yeah if

8796.24 --> 8802.5
you're gonna for example grow tomatoes

8798.46 --> 8806.919999999998
then plant basil right next to it basil

8802.5 --> 8808.06
and tomato they don't only taste great

8806.92 --> 8810.460000000001
together

8808.06 --> 8812.439
they grow great together

8810.46 --> 8814.0
they love each other

8812.439 --> 8817.06
their roots

8814.0 --> 8820.3
make each other more enthusiastic it's

8817.06 --> 8822.76
like those two plants love each other

8820.3 --> 8824.5
they actually love each other you could

8822.76 --> 8826.479
grow them right next to each other and

8824.5 --> 8827.74
they both grow better than if they if

8826.479 --> 8828.699999999999
you would have grown them separate

8827.74 --> 8830.74
really

8828.7 --> 8832.84
it's pretty amazing and there's other

8830.74 --> 8835.18
combinations like that too but this one

8832.84 --> 8838.08
always stood out to me because they

8835.18 --> 8838.08
taste so great together

8839.8 --> 8844.84
and the great at the tomato plant will

8841.78 --> 8847.84
get basil now right try it out

8844.84 --> 8851.8
have their Roots grow in the same dirt

8847.84 --> 8854.08
and you'll be surprised at how

8851.8 --> 8856.0
much they strengthen each other like

8854.08 --> 8858.819
they will become less vulnerable to

8856.0 --> 8861.18
fungus if you grow them together

8858.819 --> 8861.18
really

8864.7 --> 8867.54
it's pretty awesome

8872.439 --> 8876.04
now you can look into this by the way

8874.18 --> 8878.14
there's a whole there's people out there

8876.04 --> 8880.240000000002
my ex you got into this for a while

8878.14 --> 8884.14
there's like oh

8880.24 --> 8886.119999999999
like charts like scheduled charts of all

8884.14 --> 8888.46
the combinations of different plants and

8886.12 --> 8892.6
how much advantage that gives the

8888.46 --> 8895.179999999998
overall situation there's like charts of

8892.6 --> 8898.0
plant combinations like that it's

8895.18 --> 8902.02
like wow

8898.0 --> 8905.319
it's like specialist herb gardening

8902.02 --> 8908.2
it's very fascinating I wish I had those

8905.319 --> 8910.119999999999
sources I I should have freaking

8908.2 --> 8911.68
downloaded one of those charts on my

8910.12 --> 8912.76
computer maybe it's still somewhere

8911.68 --> 8915.7
there

8912.76 --> 8918.399
but I don't know where it's probably

8915.7 --> 8920.62
like a folder of stuff related to my ex

8918.399 --> 8921.699999999999
because she was really into that for a

8920.62 --> 8924.18
bit

8921.7 --> 8924.18
uh

8927.16 --> 8930.939
I didn't even know that existed she just

8929.26 --> 8932.62
stumbled up on it and it's like whoa

8930.939 --> 8935.28
look at this

8932.62 --> 8935.28
wow

8943.5 --> 8950.859
under cheeseburgers what

8946.84 --> 8953.399
what okay that's weird I guess I guess

8950.859 --> 8953.399000000001
that could work

8965.46 --> 8970.24
thank you

8967.24 --> 8970.24
broccoli

8970.72 --> 8973.979
okay I didn't know that

8981.28 --> 8987.52
yeah no fungi is good

8985.42 --> 8990.16
when it's in Balance I mean there's

8987.52 --> 8992.02
fungus in the ground it's part of the

8990.16 --> 8994.06
reason ground is alive it's because of

8992.02 --> 8997.0
the fungus in there it's a very

8994.06 --> 8999.699999999999
important processing mechanism to even

8997.0 --> 9002.399
create nutrients did you know that

8999.7 --> 9005.399000000001
there's like fermented food why do they

9002.399 --> 9009.019999999999
do that because it enhances the

9005.399 --> 9009.019999999999
absorbability of nutrients

9009.06 --> 9013.019999999999
like there's whole Industries about

9011.04 --> 9015.42
fermenting food which is literally

9013.02 --> 9018.24
unleashing a specific fungus on the

9015.42 --> 9020.52
product and the fungus transforms it and

9018.24 --> 9022.68
it actually makes it healthier

9020.52 --> 9025.2
fermented food

9022.68 --> 9026.76
that's fungus doing that so you have bad

9025.2 --> 9029.899000000001
fungus you have good fungus and the good

9026.76 --> 9029.899
fungus can be great

9031.8 --> 9037.259999999998
right there's good fungus involved in

9034.979 --> 9041.06
turning poo

9037.26 --> 9041.06
into fertile manure

9048.479 --> 9050.96
right

9060.479 --> 9065.699999999999
yeah but and Marco it is amazing to

9063.06 --> 9067.56
think about that like root systems of

9065.7 --> 9069.42
plants that they are like

9067.56 --> 9072.0
like cities

9069.42 --> 9074.28
just having trade routes with each other

9072.0 --> 9076.74
and all it's amazing when you really

9074.28 --> 9079.2
think about the details like that

9076.74 --> 9083.46
it just works it all just works us they

9079.2 --> 9085.5
just do it just amazing efficiency and

9083.46 --> 9088.08
system systematic

9085.5 --> 9090.18
logical interactions and the planet they

9088.08 --> 9092.399
just do it it's just it's all just

9090.18 --> 9095.24
designed to do it

9092.399 --> 9095.24
on that level

9095.58 --> 9101.88
I mean

9096.859 --> 9105.300000000001
biological life is miraculous

9101.88 --> 9107.88
when you really look into it it is a

9105.3 --> 9110.279999999999
miracle by itself that it works the way

9107.88 --> 9113.58
it does all of it

9110.28 --> 9116.460000000001
and that we can't even really see the

9113.58 --> 9118.8
entire picture but the further we dig

9116.46 --> 9121.979
into it the deeper we look into the

9118.8 --> 9125.399
functions of biology the more insanely

9121.979 --> 9129.119999999999
complex and amazing

9125.399 --> 9131.099999999999
it turns out to be

9129.12 --> 9133.02
the more you learn the more you're like

9131.1 --> 9138.859
holy [ __ ]

9133.02 --> 9138.859
God is is a freaking unimaginable genius

9153.96 --> 9156.14
foreign

9159.5 --> 9165.18
s are great they're a nice Builder

9163.5 --> 9166.859
there's nothing wrong with them lines at

9165.18 --> 9169.939
all

9166.859 --> 9169.939
you can eat them

9182.46 --> 9186.0
yeah yeah

9183.74 --> 9188.76
no chemicals

9186.0 --> 9190.859
but there's like chemicals there's never

9188.76 --> 9194.28
a good reason to spread chemicals really

9190.859 --> 9197.16
in the garden there never really is

9194.28 --> 9199.859
if you're gonna be using chemicals

9197.16 --> 9202.26
like pesticide that's basically you

9199.859 --> 9205.04
giving up on the garden

9202.26 --> 9205.04
it's War

9214.02 --> 9220.68
it crosses a certain type of border

9217.74 --> 9222.3
that's like

9220.68 --> 9224.819
yeah

9222.3 --> 9227.539999999999
it's so disruptive to the overall

9224.819 --> 9230.76
functioning of everything natural

9227.54 --> 9233.34
and you don't necessarily see all of it

9230.76 --> 9235.380000000001
it's just you use that [ __ ] and you

9233.34 --> 9237.06
think oh it's all right and then on the

9235.38 --> 9239.58
long run it can have all kinds of

9237.06 --> 9241.439
detrimental side effects

9239.58 --> 9243.72
that you will

9241.439 --> 9245.819
probably not even realize that it's

9243.72 --> 9247.38
because of the pesticide you used some

9245.819 --> 9249.6
time ago

9247.38 --> 9254.039999999999
it's [ __ ] up that's why you should

9249.6 --> 9257.300000000001
just never use it really don't

9254.04 --> 9257.300000000001
there's other ways

9267.58 --> 9270.809
[Music]

9271.08 --> 9275.479
ah okay Mark garlic yeah

9275.76 --> 9278.6
Bottoms Up

9284.34 --> 9289.939
in a giant plants that's hilarious Jamie

9287.7 --> 9289.939
sea level

9290.1 --> 9295.859
but I get it micro macro cost I mean

9293.22 --> 9298.438999999998
fractal wise yeah why not

9295.859 --> 9300.66
maybe the entire realm is like a

9298.439 --> 9304.800000000001
contained space that actually turns out

9300.66 --> 9306.3
to be the inside of every single cell

9304.8 --> 9309.3
right

9306.3 --> 9312.96
we can't see

9309.3 --> 9314.938999999998
inside of a cell when it's live and

9312.96 --> 9317.279999999999
function did you know that

9314.939 --> 9320.399
that you can't actually see what happens

9317.28 --> 9323.34
inside of a cell the only reason why we

9320.399 --> 9327.0
even have Concepts like cell organs and

9323.34 --> 9329.399
all that and DNA is because they found

9327.0 --> 9331.74
those things after destroying a cell

9329.399 --> 9335.64
it's like oh this keeps popping up

9331.74 --> 9339.06
yeah but when it's intact you don't see

9335.64 --> 9342.14
anything no refraction no D you don't

9339.06 --> 9342.14
see what's in a cell

9342.18 --> 9348.0
you don't see it

9344.76 --> 9352.5
so what if every cell before you destroy

9348.0 --> 9357.14
it actually it contains the entire Realm

9352.5 --> 9357.14
as a fractal microcosmos connection

9358.8 --> 9365.759999999998
I think like that sometimes

9362.1 --> 9369.84
it's like yeah all of this where we are

9365.76 --> 9371.52
what we see could be inside of every

9369.84 --> 9374.16
single cell

9371.52 --> 9376.140000000001
like and not just my every single cell

9374.16 --> 9379.92
but every single living cell could

9376.14 --> 9383.16
contain our entire Realm

9379.92 --> 9386.76
as a fractal microcosmos

9383.16 --> 9389.72
because we can't see what is there while

9386.76 --> 9389.72
the cell is alive

9391.68 --> 9396.380000000001
it's a bit of magical thinking but I

9393.72 --> 9396.38
mean why not

9397.859 --> 9402.66
so as above so below

9400.08 --> 9405.06
when you think about that yeah I mean

9402.66 --> 9407.46
what's why wouldn't you think of it like

9405.06 --> 9410.6
that I do think there's like a lot of

9407.46 --> 9410.599999999999
fractal connections

9410.7 --> 9417.92
Stack Up on stack repeating

9413.7 --> 9417.92
connections within the depths

9428.72 --> 9434.64
yeah you can shove stuff in there the

9431.939 --> 9436.14
point is you don't normally see what's

9434.64 --> 9441.439
in a cell

9436.14 --> 9441.439
without disrupting it or destroying it

9443.22 --> 9449.399
you don't see the activity of what's

9446.64 --> 9453.619999999999
happening in the cell like nothing

9449.399 --> 9453.619999999999
no refraction no movement nothing

9454.02 --> 9457.979000000001
as long as the cells intact you don't

9456.06 --> 9461.539999999999
see what's happening inside you don't

9457.979 --> 9461.539999999999
get to see what's happening inside

9463.26 --> 9469.26
so for all we know

9466.319 --> 9472.68
a cell that's intact could contain

9469.26 --> 9474.54
a fractal microcosmos of our entire

9472.68 --> 9476.64
Realm

9474.54 --> 9479.34
now if I were a baller I'd say your

9476.64 --> 9481.319
entire universe could be in the cell

9479.34 --> 9482.880000000001
just like in

9481.319 --> 9486.06
uh

9482.88 --> 9488.16
Men In Black where the universe is in a

9486.06 --> 9490.5
marble that aliens are playing with

9488.16 --> 9492.479
right but I'm not a heliocentris and I

9490.5 --> 9495.06
think like well there is definitely the

9492.479 --> 9496.619999999999
realm there's a limited volume of the

9495.06 --> 9499.56
realm

9496.62 --> 9502.460000000001
that could be the cell

9499.56 --> 9505.979
maybe the rectangular

9502.46 --> 9510.0
realm the looping realm is actually like

9505.979 --> 9513.779999999999
shaped like a typical cell

9510.0 --> 9515.84
like the shape of a cell

9513.78 --> 9519.78
maybe it's like

9515.84 --> 9521.28
slightly square but also slightly

9519.78 --> 9523.5
spherical

9521.28 --> 9524.28
and it has like blunt corners or

9523.5 --> 9526.439
something

9524.28 --> 9527.640000000001
and I don't know how the looping Factor

9526.439 --> 9529.62
would then

9527.64 --> 9533.0
step in

9529.62 --> 9533.0
but who knows

9533.479 --> 9539.64
I'm definitely a fan of thinking about

9536.34 --> 9541.8
micro macro Cosmos conceptions

9539.64 --> 9543.479
but I'm not claiming that as some

9541.8 --> 9545.46
absolute or whatever it's just

9543.479 --> 9548.96
interesting to think about

9545.46 --> 9548.96
things that might be possible

9558.38 --> 9562.22
okay that's interesting

9566.04 --> 9571.5
yeah that's fine but yeah I mean the

9568.26 --> 9573.960000000001
imagination you know it's not

9571.5 --> 9576.5
the micro world is pretty freaking

9573.96 --> 9576.5
amazing

9581.34 --> 9586.26
I always get

9582.84 --> 9588.0
even more astounded when I just think of

9586.26 --> 9589.380000000001
like you're gonna look on a microscope

9588.0 --> 9591.66
you're gonna see some stuff happening

9589.38 --> 9594.358999999999
there's a wiggly a little weird

9591.66 --> 9596.039999999999
bacterial phagy or whatever and other

9594.359 --> 9598.140000000001
stuff and it's like all happening and

9596.04 --> 9601.76
they're all doing stuff

9598.14 --> 9606.92
and then to think like yeah that's like

9601.76 --> 9610.92
this like this in a

9606.92 --> 9610.92
gigantic [ __ ]

9611.06 --> 9618.119999999999
huge country filled with that [ __ ] like

9614.34 --> 9621.18
that's that little insignificant little

9618.12 --> 9622.800000000001
less than a DOT is filled with all that

9621.18 --> 9624.42
weird [ __ ] though crawling around and

9622.8 --> 9625.74
doing stuff and doing stuff with each

9624.42 --> 9627.6
other and

9625.74 --> 9630.56
and that's like

9627.6 --> 9634.140000000001
a hundred billion times

9630.56 --> 9638.539999999999
right here as a part of a conscious

9634.14 --> 9638.539999999999
thing like what the [ __ ] man

9639.0 --> 9642.02
what the [ __ ]

9647.52 --> 9651.84
it makes me think sometimes that maybe

9649.68 --> 9655.52
life is just too complicated for

9651.84 --> 9655.52
Consciousness to be able to grasp

9664.46 --> 9672.06
I think just how life Works can be

9669.0 --> 9674.399
figured out a bit but to master it in

9672.06 --> 9677.58
all directions is just so complicated

9674.399 --> 9679.939
that no man could ever really

9677.58 --> 9682.979
contain it

9679.939 --> 9684.359
actually contain it and to be able to

9682.979 --> 9687.24
apply it

9684.359 --> 9688.68
is just too much

9687.24 --> 9691.02
if you're just gonna specialize you're

9688.68 --> 9693.899
gonna always end up [ __ ] around in a

9691.02 --> 9696.899000000001
special specific territory and it's

9693.899 --> 9699.779999999999
gonna lead to errors and mutations

9696.899 --> 9702.06
mostly

9699.78 --> 9704.34
I mean these asses

9702.06 --> 9706.74
three years ago thought that they could

9704.34 --> 9711.66
change Humanity oh we're going to change

9706.74 --> 9714.42
Humanities RNA technology oh yes yeah oh

9711.66 --> 9717.0
really oh wow you're really change it

9714.42 --> 9718.74
for the better no no it [ __ ] up

9717.0 --> 9720.66
everything because that's what it keeps

9718.74 --> 9723.3
doing every [ __ ] time they try

9720.66 --> 9725.939
something yeah but you think you can

9723.3 --> 9727.5
Master the design of life you [ __ ]

9725.939 --> 9731.399
retards

9727.5 --> 9734.58
you barely have a complete model that's

9731.399 --> 9737.358999999999
it's actually based on more than just a

9734.58 --> 9737.359
bunch of bluff

9738.6 --> 9742.800000000001
you think you can just redesign life is

9741.96 --> 9745.679999999998
this

9742.8 --> 9747.599999999999
no no you can you could you could make

9745.68 --> 9749.58
something temporarily but it's not going

9747.6 --> 9752.819
to be durable yeah

9749.58 --> 9755.039999999999
design of life

9752.819 --> 9757.8
the thing about what makes it so

9755.04 --> 9760.26
incredible is that it keeps being able

9757.8 --> 9762.5
to reproduce

9760.26 --> 9766.439
and keep

9762.5 --> 9769.26
continuing yeah you could make something

9766.439 --> 9772.56
with a genetically altered weird [ __ ]

9769.26 --> 9774.78
and Jellyfish monkey or whatever that's

9772.56 --> 9777.84
really cool man wow look at what we made

9774.78 --> 9781.380000000001
yeah is that gonna endure the test of

9777.84 --> 9785.399
time no I don't think there's been any

9781.38 --> 9791.279999999999
genetic creation except maybe the panda

9785.399 --> 9795.18
that's like last it the test of time

9791.28 --> 9797.76
and the panda like probably like if it

9795.18 --> 9800.52
wouldn't have been just protected by man

9797.76 --> 9802.14
since it was created it would have died

9800.52 --> 9806.460000000001
out already because

9802.14 --> 9810.66
we can't make life durable with our

9806.46 --> 9814.679999999998
little wannabe God tinkering because you

9810.66 --> 9816.66
don't get to do that you're not God

9814.68 --> 9818.7
it's not like oh you're not allowed to

9816.66 --> 9822.119999999999
do it now it's just you're not really

9818.7 --> 9825.5
capable of doing it you're just [ __ ]

9822.12 --> 9827.76
around thinking you're God like a stupid

9825.5 --> 9830.1
sorcerer student that doesn't really

9827.76 --> 9833.06
know what the [ __ ] they're doing and

9830.1 --> 9833.06
ending up

9834.14 --> 9839.76
drowning the place because she couldn't

9836.939 --> 9842.04
stop replicating that broom basically

9839.76 --> 9845.1
right

9842.04 --> 9846.84
Mickey Mouse there the wizard Apprentice

9845.1 --> 9849.06
that's

9846.84 --> 9852.24
that's like big Pharma genetically

9849.06 --> 9854.819
modifying [ __ ] like they don't actually

9852.24 --> 9856.38
know what they're doing they think they

9854.819 --> 9858.119999999999
know what they're doing they're

9856.38 --> 9861.0
pretending like they know what they're

9858.12 --> 9864.060000000001
doing they have made up model [ __ ]

9861.0 --> 9865.979
that's very convincing and reassuring in

9864.06 --> 9867.72
that they know what they're doing but

9865.979 --> 9868.5
they don't actually know what they're

9867.72 --> 9870.539999999999
doing

9868.5 --> 9872.34
on the long run they know that they're

9870.54 --> 9874.92
doing something that something is

9872.34 --> 9877.02
happening but they don't have the full

9874.92 --> 9879.24
grasp

9877.02 --> 9882.060000000001
on the consequences

9879.24 --> 9884.76
they're just hoping

9882.06 --> 9886.26
that they somehow get a long-term

9884.76 --> 9890.28
durable result

9886.26 --> 9893.22
but it usually doesn't end up that way

9890.28 --> 9896.12
in the vast majority of cases it all

9893.22 --> 9896.119999999999
just dies out

9899.64 --> 9906.66
genetic modification is very luciferian

9903.84 --> 9908.58
because it people that want to do it

9906.66 --> 9911.1
they think that they can be gods that

9908.58 --> 9913.02
they can reshape life but they're not

9911.1 --> 9914.76
actually doing that they're just [ __ ]

9913.02 --> 9916.380000000001
around pretending like they're doing

9914.76 --> 9919.76
that

9916.38 --> 9919.759999999998
it doesn't really work

9919.8 --> 9925.5
because it's a very primitive approach

9922.5 --> 9927.06
it has conceptions and models that are

9925.5 --> 9929.04
not real

9927.06 --> 9931.38
as a backdrop

9929.04 --> 9934.979000000001
for the entire setup

9931.38 --> 9937.938999999998
and so the result will just be not

9934.979 --> 9937.938999999998
not durable

9940.319 --> 9946.74
right even if you can figure out like

9944.16 --> 9950.34
food crispr or whatever organism

9946.74 --> 9952.14
alteration that can actually reproduce

9950.34 --> 9954.899
and survive

9952.14 --> 9957.779999999999
well it's still going to be

9954.899 --> 9960.899
it's still going to be snuffed out

9957.78 --> 9964.08
through statistical reproduction Cycles

9960.899 --> 9966.24
by non-modified organisms

9964.08 --> 9967.979
yeah that's what turned out to be it's

9966.24 --> 9971.34
like all the [ __ ] that they introduced

9967.979 --> 9974.099999999999
in the wild and farming like genetically

9971.34 --> 9975.899
modified crops and then they're like oh

9974.1 --> 9978.479000000001
they're gonna take it over everything's

9975.899 --> 9981.06
gonna be genetically modified infected

9978.479 --> 9983.399
yeah well guess what that didn't turn

9981.06 --> 9987.319
out to be the case yeah yeah it's

9983.399 --> 9992.34
actually the original unmodified crops

9987.319 --> 9993.779999999999
they push the the mutated crap out of

9992.34 --> 9997.5
existence

9993.78 --> 10000.319000000001
they just push it out of existence it's

9997.5 --> 10002.3
like yeah no you're [ __ ] up you don't

10000.319 --> 10005.06
really reproduce as well and eventually

10002.3 --> 10006.8
there's nothing left it when it's

10005.06 --> 10011.359
mutated

10006.8 --> 10013.699999999999
it just dies out it doesn't overtake all

10011.359 --> 10017.24
the healthy things that were not

10013.7 --> 10018.319000000001
modified yeah that's the lesson that we

10017.24 --> 10020.539999999999
learned

10018.319 --> 10022.34
in the last few decades is a great

10020.54 --> 10024.26
relief because a lot of people were

10022.34 --> 10025.960000000001
afraid that as soon as you would unleash

10024.26 --> 10030.800000000001
genetically modified

10025.96 --> 10032.599999999999
foods and species crops and species into

10030.8 --> 10035.479
the wild that they would literally

10032.6 --> 10038.479000000001
destroy the original nature

10035.479 --> 10041.539999999999
turns out that that isn't the case

10038.479 --> 10045.619999999999
genetically modified things in organisms

10041.54 --> 10047.6
need a lot of care just to be able to

10045.62 --> 10052.240000000002
survive

10047.6 --> 10052.24
unlike the original species

10058.04 --> 10063.859
I wouldn't believe Spanish are fake yeah

10061.76 --> 10066.92
well

10063.859 --> 10070.399000000001
well I believe that pandas were genetic

10066.92 --> 10073.66
like one of the first original genetic

10070.399 --> 10073.66
Crush species

10073.7 --> 10079.819000000001
there was an unnaturally bred creature

10078.08 --> 10082.939
and

10079.819 --> 10084.439
also that because it was like oh so

10082.939 --> 10087.5
special new creatures was very

10084.439 --> 10091.220000000001
popularized but because they're like

10087.5 --> 10093.14
[ __ ] or they hate people

10091.22 --> 10095.179999999998
they wouldn't come out of their holes

10093.14 --> 10097.039999999999
even though people literally paid money

10095.18 --> 10098.78
just to see that one stupid creature and

10097.04 --> 10101.78
then it would never come out so they

10098.78 --> 10105.26
would hire people like Joe Rogan to put

10101.78 --> 10107.300000000001
on a panda suit and act like a panda so

10105.26 --> 10108.92
that people wouldn't be disappointed and

10107.3 --> 10110.3
angry because they never got to see the

10108.92 --> 10112.58
panda even though they paid for that

10110.3 --> 10114.74
right I think that actually happened I

10112.58 --> 10117.68
think they actually had people like Joe

10114.74 --> 10119.42
Rogan put on a panda suit

10117.68 --> 10122.0
in a zoo

10119.42 --> 10125.06
to show the panda that doesn't mean that

10122.0 --> 10127.819
pandas are never real it just means that

10125.06 --> 10130.699999999999
they're not really a tannable

10127.819 --> 10133.399
type of species

10130.7 --> 10136.880000000001
they don't really do well they're not

10133.399 --> 10139.76
very sociable with humans

10136.88 --> 10141.619999999999
unless they're completely [ __ ]

10139.76 --> 10144.819
which there are there are like pandas

10141.62 --> 10144.819000000001
that are just [ __ ] and

10145.18 --> 10149.24
they're like yeah they don't care if

10147.38 --> 10152.06
you're there but they are [ __ ] they

10149.24 --> 10154.039999999999
probably wouldn't survive in the wild

10152.06 --> 10155.899
they'll spend the show themselves but

10154.04 --> 10158.240000000002
the ones that have an inkling of

10155.899 --> 10160.279999999999
conscious intelligence left they don't

10158.24 --> 10161.539999999999
like people they don't like the show

10160.28 --> 10164.060000000001
themselves

10161.54 --> 10166.399000000001
so that they needed to hire people like

10164.06 --> 10168.38
Joe Rogan to put on a panda suit and

10166.399 --> 10170.539999999999
entertain the people so they at least

10168.38 --> 10173.858999999999
believed the panda was real

10170.54 --> 10173.859
I think that really happened

10175.34 --> 10181.58
not saying that Joe Rogan himself did

10178.7 --> 10182.899000000001
play a panda I'm just saying people like

10181.58 --> 10185.18
Joe Rogan

10182.899 --> 10187.76
I mean he could have done it

10185.18 --> 10191.0
but I I'm not saying that it happened

10187.76 --> 10192.2
for sure but people like Joe Rogan for

10191.0 --> 10194.66
sure

10192.2 --> 10197.66
there have been those

10194.66 --> 10200.14
can you be [ __ ] yeah you can also be

10197.66 --> 10200.14
banned

10205.58 --> 10208.78
I had no idea there was a fake panda

10207.26 --> 10210.5
conspiracy yeah there is

10208.78 --> 10212.12
[Music]

10210.5 --> 10214.58
there are some people that believe that

10212.12 --> 10216.5
pandas never existed that they were

10214.58 --> 10218.18
always a make-believe creature that

10216.5 --> 10220.16
there's that there's basically a secret

10218.18 --> 10222.92
Panda Brotherhood of people that have

10220.16 --> 10224.6
specialized Panda suits just to make

10222.92 --> 10226.28
believe that this is a real creature I

10224.6 --> 10229.16
think that's a step two for I think that

10226.28 --> 10230.479000000001
pandas are original unnatural hybrid

10229.16 --> 10233.119999999999
creatures

10230.479 --> 10235.34
from like the 19th century

10233.12 --> 10238.460000000001
created in China

10235.34 --> 10241.399
or Unleashed in China probably a

10238.46 --> 10243.8
crossover between a Chinese bear

10241.399 --> 10246.56
like the red panda which is an original

10243.8 --> 10248.599999999999
real creature and a regular

10246.56 --> 10250.939
other type of air

10248.6 --> 10252.979000000001
polar bear something and that created

10250.939 --> 10255.800000000001
the panda the big one

10252.979 --> 10259.66
the white and black pen and that's an

10255.8 --> 10262.64
unnaturally a natural crossover creature

10259.66 --> 10265.52
kind of like a mule I could get you

10262.64 --> 10268.76
could guess except that it can procreate

10265.52 --> 10271.939
but it's absurdly difficult with them

10268.76 --> 10273.92
I mean that's not normal

10271.939 --> 10276.92
a creature that has so much trouble

10273.92 --> 10278.3
procreating that doesn't survive in the

10276.92 --> 10280.88
wild normally

10278.3 --> 10282.858999999999
unless they are hyper capable yeah

10280.88 --> 10286.699999999999
creatures that are like [ __ ]

10282.859 --> 10288.800000000001
brilliant and strategic and have like

10286.7 --> 10292.28
spirit Power and [ __ ] because they are

10288.8 --> 10294.199999999999
there they can just like do things

10292.28 --> 10296.24
those creatures might have trouble

10294.2 --> 10299.0
procreating and they will freaking

10296.24 --> 10302.0
survive because they're brilliant but

10299.0 --> 10304.46
pandas are not brilliant and with their

10302.0 --> 10307.1
difficulties in procreation they should

10304.46 --> 10308.66
just never survive it's not natural they

10307.1 --> 10311.18
would die out if left to their own

10308.66 --> 10314.359
devices they've been kept Alive by the

10311.18 --> 10317.06
people that originally made them

10314.359 --> 10319.640000000001
platypus looked odd yeah it looks very

10317.06 --> 10322.0
weird but it is actually a durable

10319.64 --> 10322.0
design

10327.74 --> 10330.58
yeah whatever

10332.06 --> 10335.72
raccoon brown bear yeah it could be more

10334.22 --> 10338.479
color

10335.72 --> 10341.84
brown bear or polar bear or something

10338.479 --> 10345.438999999998
but yeah I think that Panda was not an

10341.84 --> 10348.62
original species there's no record in

10345.439 --> 10350.779
Chinese literature or history about the

10348.62 --> 10352.34
existence of a black and white panda it

10350.779 --> 10355.460000000001
doesn't exist

10352.34 --> 10359.18
there's no record of it having been seen

10355.46 --> 10362.858999999999
or spotted or dug up or anything

10359.18 --> 10362.859
before the 19th century

10367.94 --> 10371.049
[Music]

10376.76 --> 10381.939
right oh and by the way I just realized

10379.64 --> 10381.939
this

10386.84 --> 10392.18
what could also be

10389.359 --> 10395.66
is that the panda

10392.18 --> 10397.76
is actually originally an homunculus

10395.66 --> 10400.96
that it might have been a homunculus

10397.76 --> 10404.6
bear that turned into like a sort of

10400.96 --> 10407.539999999999
successful procreated creature it could

10404.6 --> 10409.399000000001
be a homunculus experiment

10407.54 --> 10412.1
I mean I think that the homunculus

10409.399 --> 10415.278999999999
experimentation and the concept of

10412.1 --> 10419.08
cloning and genetic modification were

10415.279 --> 10419.08
really from the same Roots anyway

10422.3 --> 10430.479
it all started in Alchemy

10425.779 --> 10430.479000000001
yeah just stop marks of

10434.54 --> 10439.04
don't complain about how you're not

10436.7 --> 10441.02
spelling it right and then no not

10439.04 --> 10442.880000000001
spelling it right in that very sentence

10441.02 --> 10444.5
just

10442.88 --> 10447.099999999999
just stop it

10444.5 --> 10447.1
yeah

10455.439 --> 10460.06
what are you talking about Aries 106

10463.16 --> 10468.319
by the way I've been going for a while

10465.5 --> 10470.779
now I keep making this three hour shows

10468.319 --> 10473.0
guys

10470.779 --> 10475.54
but yeah I need to figure out a title

10473.0 --> 10475.54
for this thing

10496.46 --> 10499.699999999999
[Music]

10503.13 --> 10514.559
[Music]

10518.01 --> 10521.04
[Music]

10522.14 --> 10528.019999999999
yeah I don't know this title

10525.08 --> 10531.38
the unfathomable depths

10528.02 --> 10535.04
of God's design for life

10531.38 --> 10537.08
that's a decent title right guys

10535.04 --> 10539.439
it's been much of the subject that I've

10537.08 --> 10539.439
talked about

10543.08 --> 10553.889
what do you guys think

10545.83 --> 10553.889
[Music]

10558.54 --> 10564.380000000001
[Music]

10561.34 --> 10568.52
giraffes beat men in costumes holding up

10564.38 --> 10569.42
alone bro no but Jamie C Level there are

10568.52 --> 10572.24
like

10569.42 --> 10573.14
those theater people there have been

10572.24 --> 10575.66
like

10573.14 --> 10577.039999999999
ever seen like like The Lion King the

10575.66 --> 10579.88
musical

10577.04 --> 10582.2
well like they have like

10579.88 --> 10584.599999999999
Contraptions that they basically will

10582.2 --> 10587.6
have men walk in and I bet that they do

10584.6 --> 10589.279
have a giraffe with like a big broom as

10587.6 --> 10592.1
in yeah so

10589.279 --> 10594.74
in theater sure

10592.1 --> 10598.16
in theater yeah giraffes are probably

10594.74 --> 10600.439
people in costume holding up a broom but

10598.16 --> 10602.3
you'd see that I mean their faces do

10600.439 --> 10603.14
stick out of the costumes it's not like

10602.3 --> 10606.259999999998
there's

10603.14 --> 10609.34
stuck inside of this dark place in the

10606.26 --> 10609.34
suit while they do that

10611.0 --> 10618.8
right but as for nature

10614.479 --> 10623.619999999999
no no giraffes are just

10618.8 --> 10623.619999999999
weird creatures designed for the steps

10623.72 --> 10630.5
grazing animal that's

10626.42 --> 10634.76
suited for when it's dry it can graze up

10630.5 --> 10637.22
high that's that's its function

[Music]

10788.899 --> 10794.019999999999
actualize his dream because it's a

10791.359 --> 10794.02
really good dream

10802.279 --> 10807.819000000001
so yeah I'm having a great day hope you

10804.5 --> 10807.819
guys are having a great day too

10812.66 --> 10819.2
trying to impersonate a giraffe

10816.38 --> 10821.06
yeah

10819.2 --> 10823.460000000001
I don't know what a giraffe sounds like

10821.06 --> 10826.64
I never hear them the only time I ever

10823.46 --> 10828.919999999998
supposedly heard a giraffe was during

10826.64 --> 10830.778999999999
Ace Ventura when he says this is the

10828.92 --> 10832.279
sound of a Dying giraffe but I mean I

10830.779 --> 10834.74
don't know if that's actually the sound

10832.279 --> 10838.24
of a Dying giraffe

10834.74 --> 10838.24
or that he just made that up

10838.279 --> 10842.779
so I don't know what a giraffe sounds

10841.04 --> 10845.660000000002
like

10842.779 --> 10847.050000000001
they mostly just kind of like just give

10845.66 --> 10849.38
you a look

10847.05 --> 10852.08
[Music]

10849.38 --> 10853.88
yeah it's winter I know

10852.08 --> 10856.24
I mean that movie is freaking funny

10853.88 --> 10856.24
though

10861.979 --> 10865.599999999999
especially the second one

10867.74 --> 10873.039999999999
I'll just keep penguin Laura what

10871.399 --> 10876.64
what

10873.04 --> 10876.640000000001
are you talking about

10877.52 --> 10882.399000000001
zebra could be horses dressed in zebra

10880.16 --> 10887.56
costumes no

10882.399 --> 10887.56
zebras are just another type of horse

10888.02 --> 10892.399000000001
they're very similar to the horse with

10890.12 --> 10894.380000000001
the only difference really being that

10892.399 --> 10896.96
their back isn't as strong as regular

10894.38 --> 10900.858999999999
horseback

10896.96 --> 10902.358999999999
they've not been bred to be riding

10900.859 --> 10904.76
animals

10902.359 --> 10907.04
they're like the horses that always

10904.76 --> 10910.54
stayed Wild

10907.04 --> 10910.54
that's what a zebra is

10911.18 --> 10917.359
the horses that always stayed wild and

10913.88 --> 10920.06
they just use their confusion camouflage

10917.359 --> 10924.220000000001
tactic they grew Latin

10920.06 --> 10924.22
as a passive deflection

10928.7 --> 10934.52
you could also argue that

10931.64 --> 10936.619999999999
why like why did the zebras turn into

10934.52 --> 10939.380000000001
zebras in Africa

10936.62 --> 10942.68
while in Europe and other Northern

10939.38 --> 10943.699999999999
regions horses turn into horses why is

10942.68 --> 10946.64
that

10943.7 --> 10950.960000000001
well it's probably because the horses in

10946.64 --> 10953.66
Europe didn't have Lions around

10950.96 --> 10958.278999999999
yeah in Africa

10953.66 --> 10961.52
that's freaking Lions man and yeah those

10958.279 --> 10966.5
lines eat zebras

10961.52 --> 10968.479000000001
and men and it's not a huge advantage to

10966.5 --> 10970.52
even have a horse in Africa they'll dry

10968.479 --> 10973.938999999998
out quicker

10970.52 --> 10976.880000000001
and yeah they're still lines and pretty

10973.939 --> 10981.04
big predators everywhere then the worst

10976.88 --> 10981.039999999999
predator in Europe was Like the Wolf

10982.58 --> 10987.68
and so horses were always pretty big

10985.16 --> 10989.359
creatures that didn't have like a huge

10987.68 --> 10992.300000000001
amount of natural enemies they might

10989.359 --> 10993.439
have originally right in the super early

10992.3 --> 10995.438999999998
days

10993.439 --> 10999.14
the monster days

10995.439 --> 11000.7
pre-medieval times in Europe

10999.14 --> 11003.399
so who knows what used to be around

11000.7 --> 11006.399000000001
originally like that as big Predator

11003.399 --> 11008.619999999999
goes but for most of the time that we

11006.399 --> 11011.08
know about Europe there wasn't that much

11008.62 --> 11013.68
of Predator like the horses didn't have

11011.08 --> 11016.24
natural enemies so they were just very

11013.68 --> 11018.819
stably bred

11016.24 --> 11020.439
on the quality of being better writing

11018.819 --> 11022.42
animals

11020.439 --> 11025.12
and it would be very efficient very

11022.42 --> 11027.04
effective to have in Europe

11025.12 --> 11030.7
right

11027.04 --> 11033.580000000002
well in Africa it wasn't that appealing

11030.7 --> 11035.08
the Africans didn't really feel like

11033.58 --> 11039.34
riding them

11035.08 --> 11041.62
and so they never had like a cultivation

11039.34 --> 11045.399
to make them more into riding animals

11041.62 --> 11048.779
and thus zebras have ended up with not

11045.399 --> 11051.88
super strong backs and that passive

11048.779 --> 11053.74
camouflage tactic

11051.88 --> 11055.778999999999
because they mostly have to deal with

11053.74 --> 11057.699999999999
predators that the horses in Europe

11055.779 --> 11059.5
didn't have to deal with most of the

11057.7 --> 11062.68
time

11059.5 --> 11064.359
right including the temperature because

11062.68 --> 11067.06
of course in Africa it's going to be on

11064.359 --> 11069.399000000001
average hotter than in Europe

11067.06 --> 11072.58
right so that makes sense how pretty

11069.399 --> 11075.96
much the same species just became very

11072.58 --> 11075.96
differently through adaptation

11076.56 --> 11081.819
you can

11078.399 --> 11085.72
hybridize horses and zebras

11081.819 --> 11088.66
and horses and donkeys just like

11085.72 --> 11091.06
horses and donkeys into a meal you can

11088.66 --> 11094.26
do that with zebra zebra is

11091.06 --> 11094.26
the same species

11095.56 --> 11099.519999999999
it's just adapted differently because of

11098.14 --> 11102.778999999999
the region

11099.52 --> 11102.779
isn't that interesting

11107.08 --> 11110.28
[Music]

11111.88 --> 11116.16
black and white yeah well it would be

11114.46 --> 11118.539999999999
get really weird when you start

11116.16 --> 11121.06
hybridizing zebras

11118.54 --> 11124.0
with brown horses

11121.06 --> 11125.74
like what if you would find a zebra that

11124.0 --> 11131.68
wouldn't have black and white stripes

11125.74 --> 11133.96
but black white and red or brown

11131.68 --> 11137.64
they would start to look really freaking

11133.96 --> 11137.64
surreal like some snakes do

11144.12 --> 11149.439
donkey's [ __ ] cousins of horses now

11147.04 --> 11152.2
donkeys are actually smarter than horses

11149.439 --> 11154.84
Jaime sea level

11152.2 --> 11159.0
they just sound and look kind of stupid

11154.84 --> 11159.0
but donkeys are actually kind of smart

11160.24 --> 11166.96
and they have incredibly strong backs so

11163.24 --> 11168.76
where the zebra is like the weaker Freer

11166.96 --> 11172.179999999998
hunted animal

11168.76 --> 11177.279
adaptation of the horse the donkey is

11172.18 --> 11180.1
the exact opposite it is like the sturdy

11177.279 --> 11185.279
carrying animal it is the thing that was

11180.1 --> 11185.279
used to haul the heavy [ __ ]

11189.52 --> 11197.220000000001
what about mules is a hybrid mule is a

11193.0 --> 11197.22
hybrid between a donkey and a horse

11198.1 --> 11202.979000000001
and they got

11199.42 --> 11202.979
they're like bigger

11203.62 --> 11208.54
have a slightly better character because

11206.62 --> 11210.76
donkeys have like character issues

11208.54 --> 11213.060000000001
they're very stubborn they can be

11210.76 --> 11215.380000000001
bullies and all that

11213.06 --> 11217.778999999999
they're smart they're much smarter than

11215.38 --> 11222.479
horses so a mule

11217.779 --> 11224.319000000001
is as strong as a mule but more

11222.479 --> 11228.72
palatable

11224.319 --> 11228.72
more Cooperative as a horse

11228.819 --> 11231.84
that's a mule

11232.48 --> 11235.639
[Music]

11238.72 --> 11242.679999999998
easily trained more easily trained

11240.7 --> 11244.899000000001
because that horses are much easier

11242.68 --> 11247.24
trained because they've been bred for

11244.899 --> 11250.119999999999
that right bread for stronger back

11247.24 --> 11252.22
and to be easily trained to be very

11250.12 --> 11255.58
Cooperative to do

11252.22 --> 11256.899
as they are being taught told to do by

11255.58 --> 11259.06
the writer

11256.899 --> 11260.14
they've been bred for that to be more

11259.06 --> 11262.06
cooperative

11260.14 --> 11263.68
zebras are naturally not very

11262.06 --> 11267.699999999999
cooperative

11263.68 --> 11270.7
and donkeys well they would be but they

11267.7 --> 11273.52
just got too much brains

11270.7 --> 11275.800000000001
and too much character to get to that

11273.52 --> 11279.04
point right if a horse is too smart

11275.8 --> 11281.019999999999
they're gonna be less cooperative

11279.04 --> 11283.859
because that's just what happens when

11281.02 --> 11283.859
something is smart

11286.88 --> 11290.708999999999
[Music]

11291.52 --> 11294.52
any

11295.18 --> 11298.62
we didn't even know that

11301.0 --> 11305.22
I didn't know there was an other version

11302.74 --> 11305.22
of that

11307.68 --> 11314.08
Joe Joe Rogan yeah okay it's a steamy

11310.779 --> 11316.479000000001
travel it stopped being funny

11314.08 --> 11319.06
it stopped being funny yeah

11316.479 --> 11322.899
oh maybe it's this and that yeah what

11319.06 --> 11325.06
because a panda might be a crossover or

11322.899 --> 11328.119999999999
very likely to be a crossover not a

11325.06 --> 11331.06
natural species

11328.12 --> 11334.660000000002
and so now everything is fake what you

11331.06 --> 11336.519999999999
can't handle one thing being fake

11334.66 --> 11339.039999999999
now everything is fake now all the

11336.52 --> 11341.800000000001
animals are fake are they Aries 106 it's

11339.04 --> 11344.080000000002
like every time some exception is

11341.8 --> 11346.899
pointed at that you didn't see before

11344.08 --> 11351.779
now everything has to be that

11346.899 --> 11351.778999999999
like that's how a 10 year old reasons

11352.72 --> 11361.679999999998
yeah not a man in his 60s

11356.74 --> 11361.68
or 70s or however old you are come on

11368.1 --> 11371.76
pretending to be a whole human

11373.72 --> 11380.319
that's hilarious by the way like Alex

11376.779 --> 11384.1
Jones actually made fun of Joe Rogan's

11380.319 --> 11386.76
height yesterday on the show it happened

11384.1 --> 11386.76
by accident

11388.96 --> 11393.96
but yeah that actually happened

11390.58 --> 11393.96
yesterday it was hilarious

11398.08 --> 11402.0
facts no not facts

11428.62 --> 11432.640000000001
yep yes that's right slow moment buggy

11431.38 --> 11435.278999999999
indeed

11432.64 --> 11437.26
now I was expected to see like really

11435.279 --> 11439.359
old style

11437.26 --> 11441.819
like they're all really old type of

11439.359 --> 11443.380000000001
Chinese paintings amazing stuff really

11441.819 --> 11446.199999999999
really old stuff

11443.38 --> 11448.479
but you never see a panda in them you

11446.2 --> 11453.819000000001
only ever get to see pandas if it's like

11448.479 --> 11455.858999999999
a retro piece a newly made in the old

11453.819 --> 11457.0
style and that's where you get to see a

11455.859 --> 11460.479000000001
panda

11457.0 --> 11462.819
at best but the The Originals no none of

11460.479 --> 11465.58
them had pandas ever and there's been

11462.819 --> 11468.1
people like making it their life's work

11465.58 --> 11470.319
to find them

11468.1 --> 11473.02
and they didn't

11470.319 --> 11475.3
they didn't find them

11473.02 --> 11477.52
because yeah China is a big place and

11475.3 --> 11480.58
there's a lot of history and there's a

11477.52 --> 11482.62
lot of artwork so yeah to actually look

11480.58 --> 11486.66
through it all that's like a lifetime

11482.62 --> 11486.660000000002
work it's a lifetime job

11488.2 --> 11494.140000000001
but it is a well-known fact that there's

11491.319 --> 11496.539999999999
no record of pandas in any literature or

11494.14 --> 11498.46
art before the 1900s

11496.54 --> 11500.439
it's interesting that you personally saw

11498.46 --> 11503.099999999999
that up close Boogie thanks for

11500.439 --> 11503.1
confirming that

11518.8 --> 11524.938999999998
wow I've been I'm going over two over

11521.5 --> 11524.939
three hours poof

11525.58 --> 11532.439
is gonna turn into another one of those

11527.56 --> 11532.439
three hours and 33 minute shows

11541.0 --> 11545.38
it makes his tiger and elephants in

11542.979 --> 11547.84
tibetan art yeah yeah

11545.38 --> 11549.938999999998
yep a lot of Word of Mouth

11547.84 --> 11552.1
but the same thing goes for Alliance did

11549.939 --> 11555.52
you know that slo-mo moon buggy it's

11552.1 --> 11559.0
like the early Dutch medieval

11555.52 --> 11561.1
uh nobility was like obsessed with

11559.0 --> 11565.6
stories of lions

11561.1 --> 11568.06
so we have like this lion drawing

11565.6 --> 11570.279
that's like version where it's still in

11568.06 --> 11572.14
the Dutch crests

11570.279 --> 11574.42
but when you look at it like that

11572.14 --> 11579.099999999999
doesn't look like a lion at all but it's

11574.42 --> 11581.979
a that is representing the lion that the

11579.1 --> 11584.08
nobility of the Dutch were obsessed with

11581.979 --> 11586.358999999999
when in a time when they hadn't seen one

11584.08 --> 11589.18
they didn't know what they looked like

11586.359 --> 11590.800000000001
so this was what they thought it was and

11589.18 --> 11593.380000000001
that's what they turned into the

11590.8 --> 11596.64
heraldry lion

11593.38 --> 11596.64
interesting isn't it

11598.66 --> 11603.76
or there's an alternative there was

11601.06 --> 11608.38
actually a weird freaking

11603.76 --> 11610.54
half dragon half half lion creature that

11608.38 --> 11613.24
sort of looked like a Chinese dragon in

11610.54 --> 11615.819000000001
its face there might have been a lion

11613.24 --> 11618.52
weird creature that can stand on its

11615.819 --> 11619.96
back legs and was really brilliant it

11618.52 --> 11622.84
might have been around and it got

11619.96 --> 11624.699999999999
extinct and that that was a line and

11622.84 --> 11627.279
then it's like oh wait but there's a

11624.7 --> 11630.04
creature that also kind of looks like it

11627.279 --> 11633.7
who's just a more wild animal in Africa

11630.04 --> 11635.859
and we call that a lion also

11633.7 --> 11639.04
it could have been maybe a sort of

11635.859 --> 11641.26
dragon type creature that doesn't exist

11639.04 --> 11642.939
anymore the original line because when

11641.26 --> 11644.74
you look at that that's definite that

11642.939 --> 11647.859
doesn't look like

11644.74 --> 11650.08
a lion looks

11647.859 --> 11652.06
especially the face the face is like

11650.08 --> 11654.279
that of it more like of a Chinese dragon

11652.06 --> 11657.06
than of an actual lion have you ever

11654.279 --> 11657.060000000001
seen it up close

11665.2 --> 11669.819000000001
it's the dragon that interest me

11667.12 --> 11673.42
physical representation's got no no

11669.819 --> 11676.18
dragons are spirits

11673.42 --> 11679.6
their natures

11676.18 --> 11682.56
creatures in the spirit Realm

11679.6 --> 11682.56
they're right there

11683.5 --> 11688.14
if anybody remembers the movie uh

11690.34 --> 11692.880000000001
is it

11694.06 --> 11698.34
Renegade what's the other title again

11703.06 --> 11709.18
yes take forever

11706.6 --> 11710.74
really need a half an hour to boot up

11709.18 --> 11713.74
that disc

11710.74 --> 11715.84
fucksake blueberry

11713.74 --> 11720.18
talked about blueberry quite a bit well

11715.84 --> 11720.18
in blueberries like they it's about

11720.22 --> 11725.438999999998
Ayahuasca pretty much and there's a

11722.92 --> 11727.84
clear expressed struggle that happens

11725.439 --> 11731.08
within that process and that's between

11727.84 --> 11735.479
the reptiles and the insectoids

11731.08 --> 11738.64
yeah reptile Spirits are a thing

11735.479 --> 11742.0
bear the dragons

11738.64 --> 11744.699999999999
there the good guys

11742.0 --> 11748.24
within the spirit realm the snake is

11744.7 --> 11750.939
actually a good thing and yeah now you

11748.24 --> 11752.68
can imagine how Christians Catholic type

11750.939 --> 11757.62
Christians are squirting all over the

11752.68 --> 11760.779
place there it is the desert it's Satan

11757.62 --> 11763.779
yeah whatever yeah reptiles are actually

11760.779 --> 11766.2
good spirits

11763.779 --> 11769.060000000001
I don't give a [ __ ] what you believe

11766.2 --> 11771.34
about that yeah

11769.06 --> 11774.6
reptile Spirits are actually good

11771.34 --> 11777.819
they're caretakers

11774.6 --> 11782.140000000001
[Music]

11777.819 --> 11784.92
yeah they are the good ones yeah

11782.14 --> 11788.92
unless you think that the

11784.92 --> 11788.92
spider cockroach

11789.84 --> 11795.16
tentacle

11791.52 --> 11797.08
octopus creatures on the on the other

11795.16 --> 11799.3
side unless you think that they're the

11797.08 --> 11801.779
good ones yeah

11799.3 --> 11801.778999999999
no no

11803.74 --> 11808.74
dragons in the spirit realm are good

11806.2 --> 11808.740000000002
creatures

11811.06 --> 11816.399
how do I know about the spirit did you

11814.479 --> 11818.74
just bump into my channel for the first

11816.399 --> 11820.18
time today Jamie sea level I mean come

11818.74 --> 11822.96
on

11820.18 --> 11822.960000000001
come on

11826.66 --> 11830.8
how do you think I know about the spirit

11828.819 --> 11833.64
realm I've been trapped in there for

11830.8 --> 11833.64
freaking 80 years

11833.8 --> 11838.96
years ago

11836.74 --> 11841.359
you only been here three shows oh okay

11838.96 --> 11843.099999999999
all right fair enough

11841.359 --> 11844.960000000001
yeah I know about the spirit realm

11843.1 --> 11849.42
because I was there

11844.96 --> 11849.419999999998
for very insanely long time

11852.52 --> 11858.640000000001
he visited in 1997 yeah and never really

11855.58 --> 11860.68
left because I'm still recognizing

11858.64 --> 11861.939
aspects

11860.68 --> 11866.02
in

11861.939 --> 11869.439
current day time that I recognize back

11866.02 --> 11871.74
from that experience I had in 97 that's

11869.439 --> 11871.74
right

11872.439 --> 11878.74
I literally saw into the future and then

11875.5 --> 11880.72
realized afterward that just knowing

11878.74 --> 11883.66
about the future doesn't give you an

11880.72 --> 11886.179999999998
actual grasp on how events are going to

11883.66 --> 11889.8
occur anything you see about the future

11886.18 --> 11889.800000000001
you cannot change about the future

11893.26 --> 11897.460000000001
and then eventually during that entire

11895.6 --> 11899.92
experience I accepted that it's just

11897.46 --> 11903.58
gonna happen this is how it's gonna roll

11899.92 --> 11907.899
out and it could have been a lot worse

11903.58 --> 11911.14
I don't have to sacrifice my soul or my

11907.899 --> 11914.519999999999
eternal life or whatever to to change

11911.14 --> 11914.519999999999
the course of the world

11914.979 --> 11919.24
I thought that that would have been

11917.5 --> 11921.7
required at first

11919.24 --> 11924.58
I I thought when I was much younger that

11921.7 --> 11926.740000000002
the the Earth was in Mortal danger not

11924.58 --> 11929.92
because of climate change or that kind

11926.74 --> 11932.88
of [ __ ] but because of

11929.92 --> 11932.88
evil people

11933.7 --> 11938.380000000001
going crazy getting out of control nukes

11936.58 --> 11940.12
bro potentially right I still thought

11938.38 --> 11942.339999999998
that was real then

11940.12 --> 11944.26
now I know better now I know the Earth

11942.34 --> 11946.42
cannot really be destroyed by people

11944.26 --> 11949.24
they can mostly destroy themselves and

11946.42 --> 11952.12
give Earth some room to

11949.24 --> 11955.619999999999
get normal again

11952.12 --> 11955.62
where we can't destroy it

11956.08 --> 11959.38
but I didn't know that when I was

11957.64 --> 11962.08
getting into the vision so even though

11959.38 --> 11964.199999999999
I've seen from the future I saw it with

11962.08 --> 11967.539999999999
the mindset from back then which was

11964.2 --> 11968.92
highly highly incorrect about certain

11967.54 --> 11970.240000000002
things

11968.92 --> 11973.18
I was

11970.24 --> 11976.6
partially sgaw back then

11973.18 --> 11978.819
which is like a mortifyingly shameful in

11976.6 --> 11981.52
retrospect to me

11978.819 --> 11982.96
I'm super embarrassed about that

11981.52 --> 11986.560000000001
but

11982.96 --> 11989.08
it was what it was and it's kind of

11986.56 --> 11991.0
logical that I was like that because it

11989.08 --> 11993.819
was out of self-protection because I

11991.0 --> 11995.02
[ __ ] could not handle the [ __ ] up

11993.819 --> 11997.778999999999
reality

11995.02 --> 12000.0
I could not handle the existence of

11997.779 --> 12003.18
actual evil

12000.0 --> 12005.16
I rolled into all of that [ __ ] in the

12003.18 --> 12007.380000000001
real world not in my Visions in the real

12005.16 --> 12010.439
world because I thought that Satanism

12007.38 --> 12013.8
was actually kind of a a power Club of

12010.439 --> 12016.62
people that just pretended

12013.8 --> 12019.199999999999
like they were really evil just defend

12016.62 --> 12022.2
off the weak people and I thought that

12019.2 --> 12024.800000000001
was mostly a joke

12022.2 --> 12028.859
until I found out that they actually

12024.8 --> 12031.619999999999
really did [ __ ] up [ __ ]

12028.859 --> 12032.640000000001
and that they would take it too far on

12031.62 --> 12035.1
purpose

12032.64 --> 12039.66
and that's when I knew like

12035.1 --> 12043.319
I made a huge mistake I mean

12039.66 --> 12048.68
in no moment in my life does that mean

12043.319 --> 12048.68
apply more than in the face of that

12050.7 --> 12055.859
that I so I got into that into Satanism

12053.76 --> 12057.779
and that group and that [ __ ] because I

12055.859 --> 12060.18
thought it was all just the power Bluff

12057.779 --> 12063.899000000001
and it's just like no we're just free

12060.18 --> 12065.52
we don't have to abide by [ __ ] rules

12063.899 --> 12069.42
like that

12065.52 --> 12072.779
we can just get naughty get sexual or

12069.42 --> 12074.52
whatever and like be free I thought of

12072.779 --> 12076.979000000001
it like that but then I realized that

12074.52 --> 12079.140000000001
they actually do like the torture and

12076.979 --> 12082.199999999999
that they hate children and then I

12079.14 --> 12085.819
realized about ghost [ __ ]

12082.2 --> 12085.819000000001
holy [ __ ] was I wrong

12089.03 --> 12092.219000000001
[Music]

12101.34 --> 12106.5
nuke Dreams yeah I used to have them too

12103.319 --> 12108.96
well nuke it wasn't really a nuke

12106.5 --> 12111.24
it was a a giant

12108.96 --> 12114.179999999998
pyramid of Fire

12111.24 --> 12115.859
in the distance and in a big shock wave

12114.18 --> 12117.479000000001
that literally turned everything into

12115.859 --> 12120.960000000001
Rubble

12117.479 --> 12123.899
like you could see a wall of

12120.96 --> 12125.46
a Shockwave wall that would literally

12123.899 --> 12128.819
rip

12125.46 --> 12131.819
houses and trees and everything just

12128.819 --> 12134.22
and like it would just flip it out of

12131.819 --> 12136.46
the ground you could see that in the

12134.22 --> 12136.46
distance

12136.68 --> 12141.300000000001
like a wall approached me where

12138.779 --> 12143.52
literally everything was just being

12141.3 --> 12148.08
thrown around like a like a pinball

12143.52 --> 12150.899000000001
machine giant trees and houses and alike

12148.08 --> 12153.899
cars you could see that coming into this

12150.899 --> 12155.63
I had the dream like that when I was 21.

12153.899 --> 12157.979
told a lot of people about it

12155.63 --> 12160.858999999999
[Music]

12157.979 --> 12164.278999999999
but it was not a nuke it was not like oh

12160.859 --> 12168.08
Flash in a bun of fire thingy no it was

12164.279 --> 12172.380000000001
literally like a fiery

12168.08 --> 12175.8
triangle like at the Horizon it was so

12172.38 --> 12178.438999999998
big that it was super far away yet like

12175.8 --> 12182.58
the angular size was absurd

12178.439 --> 12186.359
it was an absurd angular size

12182.58 --> 12189.92
so whatever that was explosion or what

12186.359 --> 12189.92
it was too big

12190.38 --> 12194.519999999999
it was too big

12192.239 --> 12196.859
like the actual event whatever that was

12194.52 --> 12199.26
would have been like a hundred

12196.859 --> 12200.76
kilometers across or something it would

12199.26 --> 12203.52
be too big

12200.76 --> 12207.1
whatever it was but it was not a nuke

12203.52 --> 12210.319000000001
but it was something that I saw

12207.1 --> 12210.319
[Music]

12224.279 --> 12230.12
you don't go to that realm anymore

12227.34 --> 12230.12
all right

12233.76 --> 12237.56
and tsunami dreams hmm

12237.6 --> 12242.18
okay

12239.22 --> 12242.179999999998
I don't have those

12242.52 --> 12248.359
but I mean a tsunami is never going to

12244.739 --> 12248.359
happen as just impossible

12254.58 --> 12258.3
the worst that could happen is that the

12256.439 --> 12260.76
dikes break

12258.3 --> 12264.14
but tsunamis are not gonna

12260.76 --> 12264.14
that that's not gonna happen

12270.96 --> 12275.399
we're like not directly like England's

12273.359 --> 12278.220000000001
in the way

12275.399 --> 12280.88
if england wouldn't be there then the

12278.22 --> 12283.46
Netherlands would have had

12280.88 --> 12286.92
potential tsunami risk but because

12283.46 --> 12288.479
England is right in the way of the

12286.92 --> 12292.52
Atlantic

12288.479 --> 12292.519999999999
like we're not gonna get tsunamis

12306.899 --> 12311.479
now you just get bad weather dreams

12316.68 --> 12322.92
but it's crazy isn't it we can actually

12320.1 --> 12326.939
have dreams that will simulate

12322.92 --> 12330.12
a nuke even though it doesn't exist

12326.939 --> 12333.26
so it can be made real to us

12330.12 --> 12333.26
in our dreams

12334.5 --> 12338.72
I mean that's in a way magical

12339.06 --> 12341.84
isn't it

12342.06 --> 12347.519999999999
that something can be so fully so

12345.239 --> 12350.58
simulated

12347.52 --> 12352.62
that it's like that it is real but it's

12350.58 --> 12354.539999999999
in the dream that it is real and that's

12352.62 --> 12357.239000000001
really fascinating

12354.54 --> 12360.960000000001
how that works is because you believe in

12357.239 --> 12363.119999999999
it that it is made to look so real in

12360.96 --> 12367.64
the experience of your dream I mean

12363.12 --> 12370.739000000001
that's magic that's that's quite magical

12367.64 --> 12373.019999999999
that something can be made so real when

12370.739 --> 12375.84
it isn't real

12373.02 --> 12379.04
that's literal Magic

12375.84 --> 12379.04
very confusing

12384.6 --> 12389.84
don't need to know that

12387.0 --> 12389.84
thank you

12393.66 --> 12397.56
right but I think I'm gonna round out to

12395.58 --> 12399.539999999999
