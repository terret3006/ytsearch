89.6 --> 92.15899999999999
all of it

96.96 --> 102.55999999999999
and there's like planes leaving lines

99.28 --> 106.24
but they're all fading

102.56 --> 110.0
so it just seems to be all blue

106.24 --> 113.36
and bright winter sun

110.0 --> 113.36
with almost no wind

113.52 --> 118.88
it's really incredible

116.64 --> 121.68
oh and there is like snow

118.88 --> 123.6
or well not not snow frost still on the

121.68 --> 124.799
roof side see

123.6 --> 128.399
and yeah

124.799 --> 130.87900000000002
in the night i think it froze

128.399 --> 133.92
because i even saw like from from over

130.879 --> 136.16
here i even saw ice like on cars and all

133.92 --> 136.16
that

137.2 --> 142.959
and yeah already looked at the

138.8 --> 146.48000000000002
temperature it is really cold now like

142.959 --> 150.0
i don't know if it's changed much

146.48 --> 150.0
i think it was two degrees

154.64 --> 157.83999999999997
ah it's three

158.959 --> 164.8
and according to the predictions it's

160.64 --> 164.79999999999998
gonna go freezing past wednesday

169.519 --> 171.84
right

176.64 --> 182.72
anyway hello wrath first in chat america

179.76 --> 185.44
silver patriot jeff gas head

182.72 --> 186.8
welcome

185.44 --> 189.44
ah

186.8 --> 191.84
i'm starting a little late but not as

189.44 --> 194.56
late as yesterday

191.84 --> 196.239
mostly because i kind of woke up

194.56 --> 199.2
five minutes before i should be starting

196.239 --> 201.76
the show

199.2 --> 203.599
and yeah i feel good

201.76 --> 207.12
low clutch

203.599 --> 207.11999999999998
skeptic 939

207.2 --> 213.599
minus 25 jesus

210.08 --> 217.92000000000002
clutch that's really cold

213.599 --> 217.92
27 here all right well that's

218.879 --> 221.76
a lot warmer

224.879 --> 227.84
wow what a difference

228.799 --> 232.87900000000002
so america's silver patriot where are

230.48 --> 232.879
you at

236.48 --> 241.56
or are you talking like in fahrenheit or

238.56 --> 241.56
something

248.08 --> 252.64000000000001
anyway it's yeah it's a really beautiful

250.159 --> 254.64
day i feel good

252.64 --> 256.239
i think i really needed that sleep it

254.64 --> 259.59999999999997
was long

256.239 --> 259.59999999999997
i went to bed pretty early

264.8 --> 269.12
had some more dreams but yeah overall i

267.28 --> 271.75899999999996
just felt great

269.12 --> 273.6
missouri and it's in fahrenheit oh okay

271.759 --> 276.88
okay i thought so

273.6 --> 279.68
yeah that's kind of confusing

276.88 --> 283.8
i don't think clutch meant to a minus 25

279.68 --> 283.8
fahrenheit that would be insane

284.72 --> 287.04
right

291.04 --> 294.96000000000004
or maybe he does

293.28 --> 296.479
i don't know i don't

294.96 --> 300.08
like

296.479 --> 304.02
i i never get the fahrenheit

300.08 --> 305.8
never got the feel for that

304.02 --> 308.90999999999997
[Music]

305.8 --> 308.91
[Applause]

311.759 --> 316.639
huh right yeah fahrenheit no yeah it's

314.32 --> 321.44
not going to be minus 25 fahrenheit then

316.639 --> 321.44
you would yeah that's like arc antarctic

323.199 --> 328.479
right because it's always kind of higher

325.759 --> 331.36
than celsius

328.479 --> 334.36
supposedly it's 38 degrees fahrenheit

331.36 --> 334.36
here

345.6 --> 350.759
right so that means it is kind of cold

347.6 --> 350.759
over there

355.84 --> 359.63899999999995
how much is that

379.84 --> 386.08
all right yeah it's minus two and a half

382.72 --> 386.08000000000004
celsius roughly

386.319 --> 388.639
okay

388.8 --> 393.88
so it's freezing over in the usa pretty

390.88 --> 393.88
much

403.199 --> 405.52000000000004
right

406.4 --> 412.79999999999995
well i don't know yeah with the sun

408.96 --> 414.4
it's it seems all really pleasant

412.8 --> 416.96000000000004
it's kind of funny because when it's

414.4 --> 416.96
this bright

417.039 --> 421.68
in the morning as i'm sleeping it's like

420.479 --> 425.36
well

421.68 --> 427.919
my curtains don't close like perfectly

425.36 --> 429.039
so there's always going to be a bar

427.919 --> 430.56
open

429.039 --> 433.599
through which light shines i kind of

430.56 --> 436.0
keep it all on that side

433.599 --> 438.319
and then it's so funny because as the

436.0 --> 439.84
morning progresses it's literally if

438.319 --> 442.319
it's bright

439.84 --> 444.71999999999997
then there's this sun bar

442.319 --> 447.199
that just migrates on the wall and i'm

444.72 --> 449.199
kind of using it on an intuitive level

447.199 --> 451.039
as a sundial

449.199 --> 451.91900000000004
so i kind of like look at where's the

451.039 --> 453.52
bar

451.919 --> 456.4
and then i know all right it's roughly

453.52 --> 456.4
around this time

457.199 --> 461.759
and it's kind of funny because

459.28 --> 463.599
typically when it starts to hit my

461.759 --> 465.52000000000004
pillow

463.599 --> 467.36
yeah because it does at some point so

465.52 --> 470.56
it's yeah if i'm

467.36 --> 472.56
not lying towards the wall

470.56 --> 474.319
it's gonna stare in my it's gonna shine

472.56 --> 476.8
in my eyes i'm gonna notice

474.319 --> 478.879
it it's pretty much very close to when i

476.8 --> 481.759
normally start the show

478.879 --> 484.16
or at least it's now

481.759 --> 487.91900000000004
not during the summer

484.16 --> 487.91900000000004
because then that happens a lot sooner

489.199 --> 492.199
anyway

494.8 --> 498.0
yeah it's also partially because the sun

496.72 --> 499.91900000000004
is lower

498.0 --> 502.16
in the winter

499.919 --> 504.0
so then it like really horizontally

502.16 --> 505.68
keeps shining

504.0 --> 507.28
otherwise yeah in the summer it gets too

505.68 --> 508.319
high then it doesn't really hit my

507.28 --> 511.039
pillow

508.319 --> 512.479
it's funny how it works

511.039 --> 516.24
it's just something that kind of

512.479 --> 519.44
naturally arrived basically because

516.24 --> 522.159
yeah i've arranged the place

519.44 --> 524.24
right anyway how are you all doing

522.159 --> 527.12
george sanford

524.24 --> 527.12
mike sudonic

527.76 --> 531.24
daniel robles

538.959 --> 542.0799999999999
all right i'm doing great

543.6 --> 548.5600000000001
i'm still off the coffee i think that it

546.64 --> 551.04
it must have been

548.56 --> 554.0799999999999
well it must have been a big contributor

551.04 --> 557.04
why i've been feeling

554.08 --> 558.72
so wobbly

557.04 --> 561.5999999999999
in the last few weeks because i've now

558.72 --> 564.0
completely quit coffee

561.6 --> 565.279
and even like yeah well drinking beers

564.0 --> 567.92
yesterday

565.279 --> 570.64
and i feel absolutely great

567.92 --> 573.8389999999999
like really great that's unusual

570.64 --> 577.72
so i guess it really was the coffee it's

573.839 --> 577.72
it was wearing on me

581.279 --> 585.36
so i'm gonna stay off that for a while

586.0 --> 590.64
because hey if it can feel every morning

588.48 --> 594.399
this good

590.64 --> 595.4399999999999
well that seems like a win to me

594.399 --> 597.2
right

595.44 --> 599.2790000000001
but yeah the the bright light may have

597.2 --> 602.08
also contributed on the other hand right

599.279 --> 602.08
uh when was it

602.48 --> 608.9590000000001
last week it was really bright too and

606.0 --> 611.36
then i got super pissed off and or well

608.959 --> 614.079
not no i got really sick when it was

611.36 --> 614.0790000000001
that bright so

615.2 --> 619.36
you can't slowly

616.959 --> 621.3599999999999
yeah contribute to

619.36 --> 622.8000000000001
my condition just to whether it's bright

621.36 --> 625.6
or not

622.8 --> 628.079
tea so much better for you

625.6 --> 629.839
well yeah i'm drinking mint tea actually

628.079 --> 633.399
i'm still keeping to that normally i'd

629.839 --> 633.399
have green tea

634.32 --> 640.24
but i do still take green tea but i yeah

636.64 --> 640.24
i do that more in the evening

640.8 --> 646.0
i don't like drinking mint tea all day

643.68 --> 649.1999999999999
but yeah this is my arrangement right

646.0 --> 649.2
now it's working great

656.399 --> 661.2
it might

658.16 --> 664.7199999999999
might potentially

661.2 --> 667.36
also have to do something with like

664.72 --> 667.36
tumeric

670.079 --> 674.4799999999999
because yeah

672.16 --> 677.4399999999999
i don't know why but i i feel that i

674.48 --> 679.279
might also have like some temporary

677.44 --> 681.7600000000001
intolerance to it or something very

679.279 --> 683.8389999999999
unusual

681.76 --> 684.959
feeling response because remember those

683.839 --> 688.0
uh

684.959 --> 690.0
tumeric drinks

688.0 --> 692.8
a little or yeah the walls with the

690.0 --> 694.8
orange stuff i showed it some time ago

692.8 --> 696.64
it's really nice all freshly squeezed

694.8 --> 698.16
and all that

696.64 --> 700.079
but yeah

698.16 --> 702.079
i still have a bottle of that and every

700.079 --> 703.3599999999999
time i've sipped from that in like the

702.079 --> 707.4399999999999
last month

703.36 --> 709.76
it was like oh my god made like

707.44 --> 712.399
it made my

709.76 --> 715.279
intestines like overreact which was like

712.399 --> 716.399
unusual compared to say well during the

715.279 --> 720.32
summer

716.399 --> 720.32
when it was just great to drink that

721.68 --> 727.04
so

723.279 --> 729.76
yeah i'm trying to figure it all out

727.04 --> 732.48
red bull ill

729.76 --> 732.48
no thanks

736.72 --> 741.6800000000001
now that just because of the sheer

738.399 --> 744.68
amount of sugar in that no thanks

741.68 --> 744.68
yuck

746.32 --> 750.639
now i'm staying away from sugar as much

748.16 --> 750.639
as i can

752.16 --> 758.6
like coffee was the only sugar ice was

754.959 --> 758.5999999999999
still using even

761.92 --> 764.56
oh

762.72 --> 766.9590000000001
anyway yeah

764.56 --> 770.959
oh did anybody see made by jim bob's

766.959 --> 774.399
latest video oh my god it's so funny

770.959 --> 774.399
it's so freaking funny

776.639 --> 780.0
he's got this

778.48 --> 784.519
deep fake skit

780.0 --> 784.519
with jordan peterson and ben shapiro

789.04 --> 793.519
you gotta get out in the salute you knew

794.639 --> 797.6
it's all man

798.399 --> 801.36
i must have watched that like six times

800.56 --> 802.8
now

801.36 --> 805.12
this morning

802.8 --> 805.12
ah

806.639 --> 811.399
i love it when jim rob does that [ __ ]

826.56 --> 829.76
yeah also been watching uh

828.88 --> 832.16
building

829.76 --> 835.12
bertaria the second part

832.16 --> 838.8
four apart then i kind of

835.12 --> 838.8
yeah stop doing that

840.639 --> 845.519
and yeah watching half

843.44 --> 848.1600000000001
of oh benjamin's stream from yesterday

845.519 --> 850.88
which is also really good

848.16 --> 850.88
good energy

851.68 --> 856.16
and interesting

853.68 --> 859.04
like i'm now stuck in a part where yeah

856.16 --> 861.199
he's talking about basically the roles

859.04 --> 864.3199999999999
in the family all that

861.199 --> 865.92
yeah i'm really fascinated

864.32 --> 868.1600000000001
there's even things for me to learn

865.92 --> 868.16
there

869.279 --> 872.32
and to reflect

873.519 --> 877.279
in my case

874.8 --> 879.279
like with my ex-girlfriend my situation

877.279 --> 880.8
how i was basically in certain ways

879.279 --> 884.56
failing

880.8 --> 888.0
too preoccupied with my own feelings

884.56 --> 888.0
not getting productive enough

893.68 --> 896.68
anyway

901.6 --> 904.6
hmm

916.48 --> 920.9590000000001
oh yeah yeah yeah the premiere that

918.639 --> 923.6800000000001
nathan put on yesterday was the one with

920.959 --> 924.8
jose but i really enjoyed listening back

923.68 --> 927.8389999999999
to that one

924.8 --> 927.8389999999999
it's hilarious

928.88 --> 932.72
wait no that was later in the evening

931.04 --> 934.88
i think yeah the one later in the

932.72 --> 938.639
evening was with jose

934.88 --> 938.639
but it was like interesting

939.04 --> 945.04
talking about iss and planes and they

942.32 --> 948.88
were all asserting like yeah but it's

945.04 --> 950.7199999999999
like the iss is a plane it's a plane

948.88 --> 953.12
and then it can't work with the pressure

950.72 --> 955.36
and i'm like no it's not supposed to be

953.12 --> 958.639
a plane and everybody was just

955.36 --> 960.88
protesting and protesting and oh no you

958.639 --> 964.24
got it wrong oh you got it wrong oh you

960.88 --> 967.12
got it wrong constantly everybody

964.24 --> 969.279
but in the end like even nathan got with

967.12 --> 971.6
me on there and like yeah he's talking

969.279 --> 974.48
about like how it's supposed to be the

971.6 --> 977.839
mechanics the canon of the story it's

974.48 --> 980.24
like ah finally somebody's getting it

977.839 --> 982.399
and i'm not wrong i was wrong about

980.24 --> 983.44
everything i asserted there every single

982.399 --> 984.639
thing

983.44 --> 986.8800000000001
this is

984.639 --> 986.88
uh

987.199 --> 993.5999999999999
hey professor phil bill

989.519 --> 993.6
have a topic for today no not really

995.68 --> 1001.4399999999999
i mean it's it's pretty calm out there

998.24 --> 1001.44
so far it seems

1002.72 --> 1006.6
in flat earth land

1021.519 --> 1026.319
okay america's over patriot

1024.88 --> 1029.72
is that real

1026.319 --> 1029.72
it sounds hilarious

1041.6 --> 1044.8799999999999
right anyway but yeah i'm feeling really

1044.0 --> 1048.48
good

1044.88 --> 1049.679
very stable so i am up for topics

1048.48 --> 1052.72
you knew

1049.679 --> 1055.039
nah i'm not gonna do that it's his

1052.72 --> 1059.559
it's jim bob's voice

1055.039 --> 1059.559
or jordan peterson's voice

1069.039 --> 1072.72
huh i wonder if nathan's going to do a

1071.28 --> 1076.24
live stream hasn't

1072.72 --> 1078.24
actually said anything so far

1076.24 --> 1081.24
and skype

1078.24 --> 1081.24
hmm

1082.16 --> 1086.48
right so yeah

1084.48 --> 1088.96
you guys want to bring anything up any

1086.48 --> 1091.919
specific topic you want me to discuss i

1088.96 --> 1094.799
don't know flat earth or

1091.919 --> 1097.2
looping stuff or

1094.799 --> 1100.08
some kind of concept

1097.2 --> 1102.32
somebody else out there has made

1100.08 --> 1104.48
you want me to ponder on it or whatever

1102.32 --> 1108.039
like i got a lot of room right now i'm

1104.48 --> 1108.039
feeling very stable

1108.96 --> 1114.799
but yeah i also pretty much woke up a

1111.44 --> 1114.799
little over an hour ago

1115.2 --> 1120.799
so i haven't really dug anything up

1118.799 --> 1123.799
except for the hilarious video from

1120.799 --> 1123.799
jimbo

1144.559 --> 1147.559
hmm

1174.0 --> 1178.799
ah

1176.16 --> 1181.76
now i i'm not gonna do the jordan

1178.799 --> 1183.52
peterson voice constantly because it's

1181.76 --> 1186.08
like that's gonna wear my voice right

1183.52 --> 1186.08
now i got it

1186.64 --> 1190.8400000000001
i don't know jimbo must have had like

1188.64 --> 1192.4
this amazing

1190.84 --> 1193.84
flexible

1192.4 --> 1195.76
vocal chords

1193.84 --> 1199.1999999999998
because it's like a really punishing to

1195.76 --> 1199.2
even try to talk like that

1202.0 --> 1207.2
or maybe i maybe

1203.919 --> 1209.1200000000001
my vocal chords are like naturally lower

1207.2 --> 1210.48
and that makes it harder but i can kind

1209.12 --> 1212.6399999999999
of go there

1210.48 --> 1213.44
very specific circumstances but if it

1212.64 --> 1216.3200000000002
just

1213.44 --> 1218.799
like talk exactly like that that like

1216.32 --> 1220.559
it's like seriously tough i'd have to

1218.799 --> 1222.48
like really train it to get it right

1220.559 --> 1226.3999999999999
even

1222.48 --> 1226.4
can't just spontaneously conjure it

1227.84 --> 1232.6399999999999
sun is a converter eric dollard okay

1232.88 --> 1237.2
that's yeah i remember him saying that

1240.32 --> 1246.08
right so yeah what did he mean right did

1243.36 --> 1248.32
he mean the apparition we see

1246.08 --> 1249.6
that son is a converter that would be

1248.32 --> 1250.96
odd

1249.6 --> 1254.6399999999999
if he meant that

1250.96 --> 1259.3600000000001
i think he probably meant

1254.64 --> 1259.3600000000001
the process that manifests the light

1260.24 --> 1267.28
that would be some kind of conversion

1262.88 --> 1268.5590000000002
from energy electric or something into

1267.28 --> 1272.08
well

1268.559 --> 1275.32
the photonic energy

1272.08 --> 1275.32
the light

1277.28 --> 1284.08
right but i'm not buying any kind of

1280.96 --> 1286.0
claim from any person out there even if

1284.08 --> 1287.76
they're academic

1286.0 --> 1290.64
if they're gonna claim like yeah it has

1287.76 --> 1292.32
to be an object like a

1290.64 --> 1296.96
a chemical

1292.32 --> 1299.4399999999998
or plasma or whatever process

1296.96 --> 1302.799
that we could emulate see

1299.44 --> 1304.96
like we're building an apparatus oh see

1302.799 --> 1308.48
yeah it does kind of look like that no

1304.96 --> 1310.4
because that's all local all of it

1308.48 --> 1312.72
and you have no evidence

1310.4 --> 1314.0
that the sun is like that you could just

1312.72 --> 1318.08
at best

1314.0 --> 1320.0
could make some kind of a device

1318.08 --> 1324.24
and they say look this is exactly like

1320.0 --> 1326.32
the sun except the sun is holographic

1324.24 --> 1327.6
right and then you're nowhere

1326.32 --> 1330.1589999999999
because you still yeah that's the

1327.6 --> 1333.36
biggest mystery of it all like why is it

1330.159 --> 1336.0
like that

1333.36 --> 1337.84
if it's going to displace everywhere

1336.0 --> 1340.4
in sight

1337.84 --> 1343.52
through holographic nature

1340.4 --> 1345.919
then you can't claim any kind of local

1343.52 --> 1350.6399999999999
process it's just impossible you can't

1345.919 --> 1350.64
do it because it just displaces

1350.72 --> 1354.48
just like that

1352.159 --> 1358.5590000000002
that makes no sense

1354.48 --> 1360.64
like a local energy generating process

1358.559 --> 1362.1589999999999
that we could emulate through machinery

1360.64 --> 1365.2800000000002
or whatever

1362.159 --> 1366.96
is not just going to displace as you

1365.28 --> 1368.72
move around

1366.96 --> 1370.96
that makes no sense it's always going to

1368.72 --> 1374.4
be something that is actually happening

1370.96 --> 1377.8400000000001
in a location in some object or whatever

1374.4 --> 1379.44
a reaction it's going to be local

1377.84 --> 1380.799
whenever a man is going to make

1379.44 --> 1382.799
something

1380.799 --> 1386.4
right

1382.799 --> 1389.28
except maybe well a a hologram generator

1386.4 --> 1390.64
but

1389.28 --> 1393.36
even then

1390.64 --> 1395.2800000000002
that even has some kind of a local

1393.36 --> 1396.559
nature

1395.28 --> 1398.559
right

1396.559 --> 1401.36
if you compare like the hologram

1398.559 --> 1403.6789999999999
generators like glass pyramid thing or

1401.36 --> 1405.52
whatever some glass contraption and

1403.679 --> 1408.0800000000002
light lasers or whatever shining in it

1405.52 --> 1410.1589999999999
showing something 3d

1408.08 --> 1412.3999999999999
potentially even really bright

1410.159 --> 1412.4
well

1412.559 --> 1417.28
the way you could compare that

1415.12 --> 1420.7199999999998
to the holographic nature of the sun

1417.28 --> 1423.36
would be by saying yeah the entire realm

1420.72 --> 1426.0
is that glass container

1423.36 --> 1428.799
and then you get the other lead which

1426.0 --> 1430.799
other people say oh it's outside of the

1428.799 --> 1433.679
firmament something is

1430.799 --> 1433.679
beaming in

1434.799 --> 1437.9189999999999
yeah

1436.0 --> 1439.76
mechanically that would kind of make

1437.919 --> 1442.72
sense but

1439.76 --> 1444.4
it's still holographic it still moves

1442.72 --> 1446.559
with you and

1444.4 --> 1450.88
that entire idea requires a very

1446.559 --> 1452.1589999999999
specific shape for containment etc etc

1450.88 --> 1458.1200000000001
all these things that we don't have

1452.159 --> 1458.1200000000001
proof for just yet can only speculate on

1463.2 --> 1468.4
right so that is every time

1466.08 --> 1470.48
some guy out there

1468.4 --> 1473.1200000000001
has an interesting observation or

1470.48 --> 1475.919
commentary on like the sun

1473.12 --> 1478.559
and its nature

1475.919 --> 1481.2
i do appreciate eric dollar for his

1478.559 --> 1484.96
ideas they were very thought-provoking

1481.2 --> 1486.96
like he came up with that before i

1484.96 --> 1491.3600000000001
basically bumped into the idea of

1486.96 --> 1494.159
holographic pure holographic nature

1491.36 --> 1496.559
he was first with that i think

1494.159 --> 1498.64
and it did if i did think it was very

1496.559 --> 1501.36
thought provoking at the time

1498.64 --> 1503.3600000000001
so yeah i respect that but i think it's

1501.36 --> 1505.6
technically wrong and every time

1503.36 --> 1508.1589999999999
somebody's going to say oh it's like a

1505.6 --> 1512.48
plasma or something

1508.159 --> 1514.96
it's not a fiery ball it's some reaction

1512.48 --> 1519.2
yeah it kind of has to be wrong because

1514.96 --> 1519.2
holographic things can abide to that

1520.24 --> 1523.76
right so

1521.279 --> 1525.84
i hope you like the in-depth reaction to

1523.76 --> 1528.96
that question

1525.84 --> 1531.76
or you bring him up

1528.96 --> 1531.76
george sanford

1540.159 --> 1545.5200000000002
what makes oh we got a we got a critic

1542.72 --> 1545.52
in in chat

1549.52 --> 1554.84
what makes your lack of hologram no but

1552.0 --> 1558.32
i don't have a lack of hologram

1554.84 --> 1559.4399999999998
evidence right first off this is straw

1558.32 --> 1561.9189999999999
man

1559.44 --> 1565.44
i'm not saying hologram saying

1561.919 --> 1566.96
holographic nature a holographic nature

1565.44 --> 1569.279
image of light

1566.96 --> 1571.24
non-local right

1569.279 --> 1574.159
every time i say they end up like

1571.24 --> 1576.799
describing what i even mean with it

1574.159 --> 1578.5590000000002
because it's not a

1576.799 --> 1580.4
word i just

1578.559 --> 1583.6789999999999
like oh yeah it's over there rights

1580.4 --> 1585.0
already defined no i basically had to

1583.679 --> 1587.2
go to the

1585.0 --> 1590.08
etymological roots

1587.2 --> 1593.039
the idea of hologram holographic and

1590.08 --> 1596.1589999999999
forge the word in the moment

1593.039 --> 1596.1589999999999
through understanding

1596.559 --> 1602.799
it's like a redesignation

1599.279 --> 1602.799
based in the same root set

1606.159 --> 1613.5200000000002
right so hologram evidence yeah it's not

1609.36 --> 1616.3999999999999
it's not the hologram machine

1613.52 --> 1618.08
the machines that we humans have made

1616.4 --> 1620.4
that can make holograms that's not what

1618.08 --> 1620.3999999999999
it is

1620.559 --> 1625.2
right

1621.36 --> 1628.559
i never claimed evidence for that

1625.2 --> 1630.4
but yeah the la the so-called

1628.559 --> 1633.039
lack of evidence for the physical oh

1630.4 --> 1635.3600000000001
really the so-called so what is your

1633.039 --> 1638.48
evidence for the physical oh the

1635.36 --> 1640.7199999999998
pre-assumption that light can only come

1638.48 --> 1644.88
from an object and travel a distance

1640.72 --> 1647.2
towards you that pre-assumption is it

1644.88 --> 1649.5200000000002
really so have you actually measured the

1647.2 --> 1652.64
distance like actually measure not

1649.52 --> 1655.84
calculated based on more pre-assumptions

1652.64 --> 1655.8400000000001
i don't think so

1656.559 --> 1660.8799999999999
oh oh oh that's nice oh yeah yeah yeah

1660.0 --> 1664.08
yeah

1660.88 --> 1664.88
counter up the word again

1664.08 --> 1668.559
right

1664.88 --> 1669.919
from a source that's been defining it

1668.559 --> 1672.48
and ignore

1669.919 --> 1675.76
my statement how i am basically

1672.48 --> 1678.159
redefining the word i had to create it

1675.76 --> 1681.44
because there is nothing out there that

1678.159 --> 1686.3990000000001
abides to the understanding i have about

1681.44 --> 1688.559
it about the sun and its nature yeah

1686.399 --> 1692.0
so i'm going back to the etymological

1688.559 --> 1692.0
roots of holographic

1692.96 --> 1698.48
like what does it actually stand for in

1695.44 --> 1699.559
the core of the sense

1698.48 --> 1702.559
and then

1699.559 --> 1704.399
reattributing through that understanding

1702.559 --> 1709.1589999999999
the process

1704.399 --> 1709.1589999999999
of what i think the sun is

1712.72 --> 1717.76
i'm asking me about my cl what what i

1715.36 --> 1720.559
have to prove to you it is a holo has a

1717.76 --> 1722.8799999999999
holographic nature you mean that there

1720.559 --> 1728.24
is light involved

1722.88 --> 1730.48
and that it seems to like move around

1728.24 --> 1733.039
as you move

1730.48 --> 1735.039
and that it bizarrely always manifests

1733.039 --> 1736.48
it like a

1735.039 --> 1739.52
well like a

1736.48 --> 1741.6
demi sphere around you on it in a very

1739.52 --> 1744.72
specific angular setting

1741.6 --> 1746.7199999999998
right every data we have about it is

1744.72 --> 1748.799
holographic

1746.72 --> 1751.679
right all the celestials it's all just

1748.799 --> 1754.6399999999999
angles yeah light

1751.679 --> 1758.0
there's no positions there is no actual

1754.64 --> 1761.279
positions involved at all

1758.0 --> 1762.799
in any of the data

1761.279 --> 1765.2
right

1762.799 --> 1767.44
even when you're just like oh where is

1765.2 --> 1769.6000000000001
the sun at

1767.44 --> 1773.1200000000001
guess what answer you're gonna get an

1769.6 --> 1775.36
angle an angle oh oh really you think

1773.12 --> 1778.08
that somebody's actually gonna model out

1775.36 --> 1780.399
oh how are we on this little planet in

1778.08 --> 1782.1589999999999
the distance and then 3d

1780.399 --> 1785.039
model that [ __ ]

1782.159 --> 1788.0
to then sort of like euclidean define

1785.039 --> 1791.039
where it is no you're gonna say the

1788.0 --> 1794.399
angle because that's the only data you

1791.039 --> 1797.279
really have

1794.399 --> 1797.279
it's right there

1800.96 --> 1806.32
so you're gonna have yeah you're asking

1802.64 --> 1809.3600000000001
me to prove the only data there is on it

1806.32 --> 1812.0
besides a bunch of heliocentric stories

1809.36 --> 1814.7199999999998
that have not been confirmed

1812.0 --> 1817.12
it's only calculated

1814.72 --> 1821.3990000000001
right that's unreasonable

1817.12 --> 1821.399
the data is right there

1824.0 --> 1829.44
there is

1825.6 --> 1831.1999999999998
however very little physical

1829.44 --> 1832.0800000000002
measured

1831.2 --> 1836.0
non

1832.08 --> 1837.039
visual but actually physical measured

1836.0 --> 1840.159
proof

1837.039 --> 1842.08
of a physical nature of the sun

1840.159 --> 1845.44
right what's the distance to the sun oh

1842.08 --> 1848.32
you you know a number that you can chant

1845.44 --> 1851.44
oh yeah well we flat earthers

1848.32 --> 1853.279
know how that number was even derived

1851.44 --> 1854.88
from calculations based on

1853.279 --> 1857.679
presuppositions

1854.88 --> 1860.64
starting with the pre-assumption that

1857.679 --> 1863.44
venus is a ball just like earth and has

1860.64 --> 1865.919
the same size and then going that using

1863.44 --> 1870.24
that as an anchor point

1865.919 --> 1871.279
to determine angular size and distances

1870.24 --> 1873.2
yeah

1871.279 --> 1876.0
it's all a bunch of pre-assumed

1873.2 --> 1880.48
calculation based

1876.0 --> 1880.48
information points it's not even data

1883.279 --> 1888.24
yeah you have no proof for a physical

1886.0 --> 1891.12
nature of the sun at all only the

1888.24 --> 1893.919
assumption that it has to be like a

1891.12 --> 1896.32
device that we can make that or a fire

1893.919 --> 1898.48
or whatever that we can make that makes

1896.32 --> 1899.36
locally light and that is going all the

1898.48 --> 1901.1200000000001
way

1899.36 --> 1903.6789999999999
and then being absorbed here that

1901.12 --> 1906.2399999999998
pre-assumption is really the only thing

1903.679 --> 1909.44
you have to go by that you just can't

1906.24 --> 1912.159
imagine how la light can holographically

1909.44 --> 1912.159
manifest

1912.48 --> 1915.88
that's all

1921.44 --> 1928.6000000000001
yeah so there's my evidence

1924.08 --> 1928.6
so naive of you indeed

1934.24 --> 1940.3990000000001
i mean what what are you expecting that

1936.08 --> 1942.8799999999999
i'm gonna like dig up some scientists

1940.399 --> 1945.76
writing a paper about exactly what i'm

1942.88 --> 1949.64
talking about yeah they don't exist

1945.76 --> 1949.64
nobody's done that

1950.0 --> 1956.399
i don't know how to do that

1954.0 --> 1958.48
i mean i could just write about it

1956.399 --> 1961.36
but i can't like

1958.48 --> 1963.6
i can't physically

1961.36 --> 1967.039
like i can barely move beyond just my

1963.6 --> 1969.4399999999998
intuitive understanding of it all

1967.039 --> 1971.279
like i don't know how that's possible if

1969.44 --> 1974.3990000000001
i knew how that was possible then i

1971.279 --> 1977.2
could potentially recreate the effect

1974.399 --> 1979.6
like make like a a dome or whatever in

1977.2 --> 1981.8400000000001
which you would have like absolute

1979.6 --> 1984.1589999999999
holographic manifestation through some

1981.84 --> 1985.519
complex projector or something

1984.159 --> 1988.24
right

1985.519 --> 1990.559
i can't do that i'm not a technological

1988.24 --> 1992.88
expert with such things

1990.559 --> 1992.8799999999999
right

1994.0 --> 1999.36
i can't make holographic machines

1997.84 --> 2003.9599999999998
i bet there are people out there that

1999.36 --> 2003.9599999999998
kill that could if they were interested

2011.2 --> 2016.8400000000001
i'm assuming that something can exist in

2013.6 --> 2020.32
nature immaterially

2016.84 --> 2021.279
no unless you're going to claim that

2020.32 --> 2024.72
light

2021.279 --> 2028.039
in itself is immaterial

2024.72 --> 2028.039
then yes

2034.159 --> 2039.7990000000002
like a rainbow indeed

2036.08 --> 2039.799
right it does exist

2051.28 --> 2056.52
hello professor phil bell and jose

2074.079 --> 2080.2400000000002
like

2075.599 --> 2080.2400000000002
i just hij now i didn't hijack the word

2081.119 --> 2084.639
i

2082.24 --> 2086.3199999999997
i didn't hijack i'm not taking away the

2084.639 --> 2089.28
original

2086.32 --> 2091.44
definitions

2089.28 --> 2093.76
of holographic

2091.44 --> 2095.919
well what do you want me to just call it

2093.76 --> 2098.4
like flubally wobble or something

2095.919 --> 2100.48
something ridic like something that's

2098.4 --> 2102.48
like absolutely doesn't have to do with

2100.48 --> 2105.04
anything because it's unique

2102.48 --> 2107.44
no i'm not gonna name it something

2105.04 --> 2109.68
unique

2107.44 --> 2111.52
i specifically want to go for the more

2109.68 --> 2113.04
descriptive route

2111.52 --> 2116.599
holographic

2113.04 --> 2116.599
image of light

2119.04 --> 2124.24
because it is already confusing enough

2122.8 --> 2128.1600000000003
i'm not gonna like

2124.24 --> 2130.72
make it even more confusing by yeah

2128.16 --> 2132.3199999999997
hiding the roots of what i'm even trying

2130.72 --> 2134.48
to describe right

2132.32 --> 2136.96
it's all about making it understood

2134.48 --> 2136.96
that's all

2137.92 --> 2143.04
hence to do with hologram yeah well

2140.72 --> 2145.1189999999997
effectively yeah you could consider it

2143.04 --> 2147.92
as a hologram

2145.119 --> 2148.88
but it's not a hologram that

2147.92 --> 2151.52
we

2148.88 --> 2153.6800000000003
i know how to make in a technological

2151.52 --> 2156.32
device

2153.68 --> 2159.1189999999997
i can roughly compare it to that i just

2156.32 --> 2162.0
did all that

2159.119 --> 2164.56
but if you say hologram everybody's just

2162.0 --> 2168.32
immediately gonna go squirting over some

2164.56 --> 2169.359
sci-fi movie [ __ ] or whatever

2168.32 --> 2172.8
right

2169.359 --> 2176.16
the whole idea of a hologram is even

2172.8 --> 2178.1600000000003
like popular wise is to fool

2176.16 --> 2180.8799999999997
somebody into thinking there is

2178.16 --> 2183.5989999999997
something physically there that's the

2180.88 --> 2185.119
almost like the point of a hologram

2183.599 --> 2187.2000000000003
technology

2185.119 --> 2189.44
and

2187.2 --> 2189.4399999999996
no

2196.0 --> 2200.8
you can't

2197.119 --> 2203.2000000000003
approach it a hologram is approaching

2200.8 --> 2204.32
like a technological hologram you can

2203.2 --> 2206.7999999999997
approach

2204.32 --> 2209.3590000000004
its angular size in relation to the

2206.8 --> 2210.5600000000004
observer will

2209.359 --> 2213.119
grow

2210.56 --> 2215.599
like a local object because that's what

2213.119 --> 2217.599
the hologram technology does it's like

2215.599 --> 2219.119
there to fool you that there's something

2217.599 --> 2221.599
physically there

2219.119 --> 2224.32
but it's bound in the euclidean way the

2221.599 --> 2226.96
way the devices do that

2224.32 --> 2228.7200000000003
the sun doesn't

2226.96 --> 2232.16
that's the point

2228.72 --> 2235.1189999999997
it's not just like the device so to just

2232.16 --> 2237.04
call it a hologram doesn't work

2235.119 --> 2240.04
it's just gonna make people scored over

2237.04 --> 2240.04
it

2259.68 --> 2263.2799999999997
definitely not healing my

2268.839 --> 2274.24
wetness well it's not burning helium

2271.68 --> 2277.44
it's not a gas lamp the sun is not a

2274.24 --> 2277.4399999999996
freaking gas lamp

2277.839 --> 2280.7999999999997
that's ridiculous

2281.2 --> 2287.52
like that that doesn't comport with loss

2284.0 --> 2287.52
of thermodynamics at all

2287.599 --> 2290.1600000000003
like

2288.64 --> 2292.96
nothing about it

2290.16 --> 2295.7599999999998
the scale nothing about it

2292.96 --> 2298.48
it's not an object in a specific

2295.76 --> 2300.88
euclidean position hovering over earth

2298.48 --> 2303.599
or any distance away

2300.88 --> 2305.44
it that's not what it is

2303.599 --> 2308.32
there's no proof of it there would be

2305.44 --> 2310.0
angular size changes

2308.32 --> 2313.119
when you approach it

2310.0 --> 2316.079
there is no such evidence whatsoever and

2313.119 --> 2318.7200000000003
there should be lots of it

2316.079 --> 2323.04
and there isn't at all

2318.72 --> 2325.2
it's rather super elusive actually

2323.04 --> 2327.599
like even throughout the day as the sun

2325.2 --> 2330.24
goes under it's like nothing about that

2327.599 --> 2334.56
makes sense if it were an object

2330.24 --> 2334.56
it's all just really acting weird

2334.72 --> 2340.64
the consistent angular speed of the sun

2337.599 --> 2344.96
is just a dead giveaway that it's not an

2340.64 --> 2344.96
object floating anywhere

2345.839 --> 2350.64
right

2347.599 --> 2353.44
the earth is not like a flat disc in the

2350.64 --> 2355.5989999999997
middle of space with the sun away

2353.44 --> 2358.079
well you could if you want to break your

2355.599 --> 2359.44
mind and feel like an idiot imagine that

2358.079 --> 2361.52
it is kind of like that as you're

2359.44 --> 2364.0
looking at yeah you could do that but

2361.52 --> 2367.52
nothing about that makes sense and flat

2364.0 --> 2369.04
earthers definitely don't claim that

2367.52 --> 2371.52
so

2369.04 --> 2374.24
what what do they do well they then

2371.52 --> 2377.28
imagine it is very close by and it's

2374.24 --> 2380.0
like hovering over the disk or whatever

2377.28 --> 2382.1600000000003
well guess what it's not

2380.0 --> 2385.599
you can't if you'd approach that the

2382.16 --> 2388.3999999999996
angular size would increase even more

2385.599 --> 2391.44
and the angular speed

2388.4 --> 2391.44
throughout the day

2391.68 --> 2396.3999999999996
would differ greatly

2394.16 --> 2398.48
it would have to

2396.4 --> 2400.88
it doesn't

2398.48 --> 2403.359
so what are you left with then just

2400.88 --> 2405.92
squirting about and like

2403.359 --> 2407.839
bickering back and forth which one yours

2405.92 --> 2409.6800000000003
is wrong no yours is wrong yours is

2407.839 --> 2411.599
wrong yeah or you could just say yeah

2409.68 --> 2413.5989999999997
they're all wrong it's freaking

2411.599 --> 2415.52
holographic it doesn't have a position

2413.599 --> 2417.76
there's no evidence for this

2415.52 --> 2421.44
the only data you got is angular that's

2417.76 --> 2424.7200000000003
the only [ __ ] you got

2421.44 --> 2427.44
there's no proof it is in a euclidean

2424.72 --> 2429.1189999999997
apparition even

2427.44 --> 2432.16
there's no proof

2429.119 --> 2435.92
that it is a hologram in a specific

2432.16 --> 2439.72
location in space there is no evidence

2435.92 --> 2439.7200000000003
for this at all

2449.839 --> 2454.96
fusion of hydrogen yeah sure professor

2453.28 --> 2456.96
phil though sure

2454.96 --> 2458.88
i know i know the story i know it's

2456.96 --> 2461.44
supposed to be

2458.88 --> 2463.599
but yeah i'm not even gonna go there

2461.44 --> 2463.599
like

2464.319 --> 2469.2799999999997
the amount of fallacies that surrounds

2466.72 --> 2471.1189999999997
that idea that conception of what the

2469.28 --> 2473.599
sun is is so

2471.119 --> 2477.04
overwhelming

2473.599 --> 2480.8
it's almost as overwhelming as the

2477.04 --> 2484.4
presupposed virtual size of the sun that

2480.8 --> 2485.44
the heliocentric model claims

2484.4 --> 2488.1600000000003
right

2485.44 --> 2491.2000000000003
as enormous as we're supposed to imagine

2488.16 --> 2493.359
it is that's how overwhelming the amount

2491.2 --> 2496.319
of fallacies

2493.359 --> 2498.64
that surround the entire concept are

2496.319 --> 2498.64
yeah

2499.68 --> 2503.7599999999998
but that's okay

2501.28 --> 2506.0
you can remind us of what the model

2503.76 --> 2509.2000000000003
supposed to say it is

2506.0 --> 2511.76
that's fine

2509.2 --> 2515.2799999999997
but i'm not even considering that that's

2511.76 --> 2518.6400000000003
ridiculous that's not involved in well

2515.28 --> 2520.6400000000003
the actual conversation i'm having

2518.64 --> 2522.319
about the nature of the sun

2520.64 --> 2525.1189999999997
that's not even going to be in the in

2522.319 --> 2528.16
the consideration list at all

2525.119 --> 2528.1600000000003
it's so ridiculous

2534.4 --> 2538.8
parker solar power probe yeah sure oh

2537.68 --> 2541.359
look at

2538.8 --> 2544.319
look at all our satellites oh we got a

2541.359 --> 2547.119
satellite right next to the sun

2544.319 --> 2550.48
yeah yeah yeah there's no footage though

2547.119 --> 2552.4
at all whatsoever ever ever made ever

2550.48 --> 2555.119
made even though there's cameras on

2552.4 --> 2557.599
these things ever made of the actual

2555.119 --> 2560.4
going there

2557.599 --> 2562.6400000000003
which would yield some real serious data

2560.4 --> 2565.599
of angular size increase and all that no

2562.64 --> 2567.68
no no you just have to trust them that

2565.599 --> 2569.6800000000003
once they're in the right spot that's

2567.68 --> 2572.3999999999996
when the camera opens and that's when

2569.68 --> 2573.9199999999996
you get to see oh look at the sun oh

2572.4 --> 2575.599
yeah but you didn't get to see the

2573.92 --> 2578.8
actual approach though

2575.599 --> 2581.119
to actually give us some conf yeah

2578.8 --> 2583.119
comforting evidence that any of what

2581.119 --> 2585.6800000000003
you're doing is real no no you're just

2583.119 --> 2588.2400000000002
gonna have to oh look oh oh the camera

2585.68 --> 2590.24
is open oh that's the sun

2588.24 --> 2592.56
yeah right

2590.24 --> 2595.1189999999997
no no there should be approach footage

2592.56 --> 2597.92
there isn't there never is all these

2595.119 --> 2600.96
stupid supposed satellites out there

2597.92 --> 2602.7200000000003
giving us these spectacular images

2600.96 --> 2605.04
images yeah

2602.72 --> 2606.7999999999997
not photographs images

2605.04 --> 2608.0
yeah yeah

2606.8 --> 2609.6800000000003
yeah

2608.0 --> 2612.0
but there's no

2609.68 --> 2614.16
footage of its approach there's no proof

2612.0 --> 2616.0
of angular size increase whatsoever it's

2614.16 --> 2618.24
just oh you got to just trust although

2616.0 --> 2622.56
now the camera opens oh look it's right

2618.24 --> 2622.56
there oh yeah how convenient

2622.8 --> 2628.2400000000002
just open the looking box and oh it's

2625.2 --> 2628.24
right there really

2628.48 --> 2634.52
i just trust the signs

2631.28 --> 2634.52
right clutch

2638.079 --> 2643.3590000000004
ah yeah quantum computing yeah that's

2640.56 --> 2645.52
another ridiculous myth

2643.359 --> 2646.839
indeed rest ahead

2645.52 --> 2650.48
welcome to

2646.839 --> 2653.68
chat we actually do measure the energy

2650.48 --> 2655.68
oh yeah you mean you calculate it

2653.68 --> 2658.319
you measure the energy at ground level

2655.68 --> 2662.319
and then you try to back calculate how

2658.319 --> 2663.52
immensely overwhelming it should be it

2662.319 --> 2667.04
should be

2663.52 --> 2669.2
i know you can do that professor philbel

2667.04 --> 2672.319
i know you can calculate how

2669.2 --> 2674.64
overwhelming the energy should be and

2672.319 --> 2676.88
then speculate what could possibly

2674.64 --> 2678.56
generate that much energy

2676.88 --> 2681.839
well yeah

2678.56 --> 2684.64
well if you've asked that question like

2681.839 --> 2685.92
500 years ago at some point yeah you

2684.64 --> 2687.52
wouldn't have that issue because it's

2685.92 --> 2689.119
like oh no it's not that overwhelming

2687.52 --> 2690.88
because it's much closer

2689.119 --> 2692.56
right that's what the astronomy guy said

2690.88 --> 2693.839
it's much closer so it doesn't have to

2692.56 --> 2695.04
be that overwhelming it could be

2693.839 --> 2697.04
something else it doesn't have to be

2695.04 --> 2698.56
like a fusion reaction

2697.04 --> 2700.88
which we don't even know what that is we

2698.56 --> 2700.88
haven't

2701.44 --> 2706.56
figured out how to

2703.359 --> 2708.0
imagine that and then conjure it into re

2706.56 --> 2710.4
existence

2708.0 --> 2712.4
through supposed vision theory and

2710.4 --> 2714.1600000000003
einstein [ __ ]

2712.4 --> 2715.839
right so that's all fictional as well

2714.16 --> 2717.5989999999997
like the entire premise is already

2715.839 --> 2721.44
fictional

2717.599 --> 2724.48
doesn't actually exist like that

2721.44 --> 2727.76
right there's no super ultra super mega

2724.48 --> 2730.079
energy possible through like atomic

2727.76 --> 2731.5200000000004
vision and all that nonsense

2730.079 --> 2733.28
that's ridiculous

2731.52 --> 2735.2
that's fiction also

2733.28 --> 2737.599
i hadn't figured it out yet but yeah it

2735.2 --> 2739.839
would be very different if you 500 years

2737.599 --> 2742.319
ago when it all was just kind of you

2739.839 --> 2744.319
know how historically the distances have

2742.319 --> 2747.839
kind of moved around

2744.319 --> 2750.72
oh they just refined the data yeah yeah

2747.839 --> 2753.2799999999997
and you're going by the end result of

2750.72 --> 2755.359
that refined data now it's just said and

2753.28 --> 2759.28
it's not gonna change anymore except it

2755.359 --> 2761.44
kind of does sometimes a little but yeah

2759.28 --> 2763.76
but it's still all based all these

2761.44 --> 2768.0
things oh so much energy coming from the

2763.76 --> 2771.3590000000004
sun because this assumed distance

2768.0 --> 2774.56
would it would make have to make it

2771.359 --> 2776.48
this powerful in order to traverse all

2774.56 --> 2778.96
that distance yeah

2776.48 --> 2781.119
but what if it was 500 years ago and it

2778.96 --> 2782.7200000000003
wasn't all that distance yet you would

2781.119 --> 2784.8
have sized it up as a completely

2782.72 --> 2788.0789999999997
different amount of energy and you

2784.8 --> 2791.76
probably have said like was made of

2788.079 --> 2793.6800000000003
something else not helium and hydrogen

2791.76 --> 2794.8
just something else because

2793.68 --> 2796.56
yeah

2794.8 --> 2798.96
the model was completely different back

2796.56 --> 2800.96
then right you don't even realize that

2798.96 --> 2804.0
you're leaning on these things that have

2800.96 --> 2805.68
literally moved around in history like a

2804.0 --> 2808.16
slider

2805.68 --> 2810.7999999999997
like the scale of all things have just

2808.16 --> 2812.7999999999997
moved around like a slider

2810.8 --> 2815.8390000000004
and you just have to quickly adapt at

2812.8 --> 2818.5600000000004
the currently assumed slider distance

2815.839 --> 2819.92
for your calculations your backtracking

2818.56 --> 2823.359
calculations based on your

2819.92 --> 2823.359
pre-assumptions yeah yeah

2823.68 --> 2827.96
you don't even realize what you're doing

2832.64 --> 2835.52
it's all nonsense

2836.319 --> 2842.079
you can't calculate how much energy

2840.4 --> 2843.6800000000003
something has when you don't even know

2842.079 --> 2845.44
the position and you can't know the

2843.68 --> 2847.52
position it's holographic it doesn't

2845.44 --> 2852.64
actually have a real distance it only

2847.52 --> 2852.64
has an apparent distance which is purely

2854.16 --> 2858.16
yeah

2855.359 --> 2859.92
it's well it's not even interpretation

2858.16 --> 2863.2799999999997
it's more like

2859.92 --> 2866.079
what is in between that angular

2863.28 --> 2868.8
virtual this yeah the the virtual

2866.079 --> 2870.4
distance may change of the sun based on

2868.8 --> 2872.88
the conditions in the atmosphere it

2870.4 --> 2875.28
might seem closer at times

2872.88 --> 2878.6400000000003
it might seem further away all depending

2875.28 --> 2880.0
on what is in between

2878.64 --> 2882.4
and that's kind of where to even say it

2880.0 --> 2884.8
but rather like what is around you

2882.4 --> 2887.359
will determine how

2884.8 --> 2890.559
yeah like rainbows where it might seem

2887.359 --> 2892.96
to appear in relation to how you size it

2890.559 --> 2895.28
up where it roughly is

2892.96 --> 2897.2
right how you interpret the holographic

2895.28 --> 2898.8390000000004
distance

2897.2 --> 2902.64
that may

2898.839 --> 2904.4
change that it doesn't really resolve

2902.64 --> 2906.7999999999997
a lot

2904.4 --> 2908.319
like how much energy is there

2906.8 --> 2910.96
because the energy just seems kind of

2908.319 --> 2914.319
constant it doesn't really matter how

2910.96 --> 2916.2400000000002
far away or close by it seems to be the

2914.319 --> 2919.8
amount of energy that is received is

2916.24 --> 2919.7999999999997
kind of persistent

2928.4 --> 2931.599
light rays from the sun

2934.96 --> 2940.079
yeah well if it's a holographic nature

2937.44 --> 2943.8
then yeah there is not really

2940.079 --> 2943.8
it's weird man

2947.839 --> 2953.04
i mean

2948.96 --> 2953.04
they might seem kind of parallel

2954.319 --> 2957.599
but in reality they aren't

2956.48 --> 2960.4
it's like

2957.599 --> 2964.2400000000002
you could consider that the sunlight

2960.4 --> 2967.6800000000003
holographic manifestation is parallel

2964.24 --> 2969.839
or apparently so like apparent not

2967.68 --> 2972.72
actual because it isn't even a real

2969.839 --> 2975.599
thing coming from a real position

2972.72 --> 2978.48
just in relation to the observer

2975.599 --> 2981.119
it may be parallel you may perceive it

2978.48 --> 2982.88
as parallel but go to another location

2981.119 --> 2985.359
look at the same spot where the first

2982.88 --> 2988.559
person is standing

2985.359 --> 2990.72
and the light doesn't compare to that

2988.559 --> 2992.48
it's actually another direction so if

2990.72 --> 2996.72
it's a different

2992.48 --> 2996.72
direction everywhere you are

2997.68 --> 3002.96
but it's apparently parallel for every

3001.04 --> 3006.079
for every spot

3002.96 --> 3008.2400000000002
that's literally so paradoxical that

3006.079 --> 3010.2400000000002
makes absolutely no sense whatsoever

3008.24 --> 3012.5589999999997
it's not an object in a euclidean

3010.24 --> 3013.9199999999996
position anywhere shining off parallel

3012.559 --> 3016.7200000000003
rays

3013.92 --> 3016.7200000000003
can't be that

3017.92 --> 3023.28
but yeah the apparition that you see

3022.319 --> 3027.04
may

3023.28 --> 3029.76
appear to give off parallel rays

3027.04 --> 3031.7599999999998
it may appear to it doesn't actually

3029.76 --> 3033.76
because it's not an object in an actual

3031.76 --> 3035.6800000000003
position giving off parallel rays

3033.76 --> 3036.96
because then it would be the same

3035.68 --> 3038.5589999999997
everywhere

3036.96 --> 3041.44
there would be no

3038.559 --> 3042.88
deviations in the light

3041.44 --> 3044.96
results

3042.88 --> 3049.88
at any point it would always look the

3044.96 --> 3049.88
same from every angle and it doesn't

3055.599 --> 3061.839
cloud show convergent race

3058.48 --> 3064.48
or clouds can show all kinds of rays

3061.839 --> 3064.48
from the sun

3067.76 --> 3073.44
it kind of depends on

3070.88 --> 3074.8
how close by the sun

3073.44 --> 3077.28
seems

3074.8 --> 3079.76
seems to be in relation to that cloud

3077.28 --> 3081.44
which is actually a thing in a euclidean

3079.76 --> 3084.6400000000003
position

3081.44 --> 3087.44
so it depends on how far away the sun

3084.64 --> 3089.2799999999997
seems to be if it seems to be

3087.44 --> 3090.88
pretty close to the clouds yeah there's

3089.28 --> 3093.52
going to be like

3090.88 --> 3095.839
crepuscular rays and all over the place

3093.52 --> 3099.2
but if the cloud is much closer it's

3095.839 --> 3102.0789999999997
much more of a misty cloud close by

3099.2 --> 3104.96
and the sun is just for some reason like

3102.079 --> 3107.76
seems very far away

3104.96 --> 3110.8
it's not really that crepuscular what

3107.76 --> 3112.079
comes through have you ever realized

3110.8 --> 3115.44
that

3112.079 --> 3118.1600000000003
it's not always that creeposcular

3115.44 --> 3120.64
it's only when the sun seems to be very

3118.16 --> 3122.0789999999997
close or like almost inside the cloud or

3120.64 --> 3125.92
right behind it

3122.079 --> 3129.76
that's when there's crepuscular rays

3125.92 --> 3132.2400000000002
but if the the apparent distance between

3129.76 --> 3134.7200000000003
the sun and the cloud it's coming

3132.24 --> 3137.4399999999996
through is much higher

3134.72 --> 3140.64
apparently not actual distance

3137.44 --> 3142.88
or on the actual distance for the cloud

3140.64 --> 3146.0789999999997
yeah then it doesn't always seem that

3142.88 --> 3148.319
crepuscular when it comes through it

3146.079 --> 3149.599
i'm sorry it just doesn't that's it it

3148.319 --> 3152.48
differs

3149.599 --> 3155.119
in my observation it differs

3152.48 --> 3157.359
it just does

3155.119 --> 3160.88
sometimes it's crepuscular sometimes

3157.359 --> 3160.88
it's not so crepuscular

3161.92 --> 3165.559
what can you do

3168.8 --> 3173.319
one thing that i do know is that any

3171.2 --> 3175.2
observation of crepuscular rays

3173.319 --> 3177.2
immediately

3175.2 --> 3178.839
totally and utterly destroys the

3177.2 --> 3181.2
conception that it's a

3178.839 --> 3184.16
giant ball of

3181.2 --> 3187.2799999999997
fire or plasma or anything at it

3184.16 --> 3189.68
what is it 93 million miles away that

3187.28 --> 3191.6800000000003
could never happen ever there could

3189.68 --> 3193.52
never be crepuscular rays coming through

3191.68 --> 3195.9199999999996
a cloud like that ever

3193.52 --> 3198.72
in heliocentric model

3195.92 --> 3198.7200000000003
that's for sure

3198.8 --> 3203.52
but it's not always crepuscular but you

3201.68 --> 3204.64
could call a black swan on that like

3203.52 --> 3208.319
yeah

3204.64 --> 3211.2
if the sun was a giant ball much bigger

3208.319 --> 3212.96
than the earth of whatever we don't care

3211.2 --> 3214.16
what's in there what's supposedly the

3212.96 --> 3216.8
effect

3214.16 --> 3219.68
giving off light at 93 million miles

3216.8 --> 3220.7200000000003
away there could never be crepuscular

3219.68 --> 3221.839
rays

3220.72 --> 3224.319
there are

3221.839 --> 3226.64
crepuscular rays visible at times

3224.319 --> 3229.68
through clouds thus

3226.64 --> 3231.839
the sun is not a giant ball of whatever

3229.68 --> 3233.44
93 million miles away and that's it

3231.839 --> 3236.319
black swan

3233.44 --> 3239.28
that's a a light based sun-based black

3236.319 --> 3239.2799999999997
swan right there

3240.16 --> 3245.52
right does it mean

3242.559 --> 3247.52
we know what it is but that definitely

3245.52 --> 3250.24
proves what it isn't

3247.52 --> 3252.4
right it's just like the black swan

3250.24 --> 3254.7999999999997
observation about the horizon

3252.4 --> 3257.2000000000003
proves it's not a ball earth you're

3254.8 --> 3260.7200000000003
standing on

3257.2 --> 3264.24
so does crepuscular rays prove it's not

3260.72 --> 3267.52
a giant ball of whatever 93 million

3264.24 --> 3270.0
miles away shining parallel light on us

3267.52 --> 3272.24
it's the same black swan argument but

3270.0 --> 3274.319
for the sun it's right there there you

3272.24 --> 3278.359
go

3274.319 --> 3278.359
we got another black swan

3284.88 --> 3287.88
ah

3295.68 --> 3299.1189999999997
yeah stop the traffic i'm arrested yeah

3297.28 --> 3303.3190000000004
it's squirty balls

3299.119 --> 3303.319
like they're very drained

3312.24 --> 3318.3999999999996
uh it seems nathan is having a live show

3315.76 --> 3321.28
that's cool

3318.4 --> 3323.44
because he opened up a room

3321.28 --> 3325.3590000000004
so yeah

3323.44 --> 3328.319
that means i have another 20 minutes and

3325.359 --> 3328.319
then i'm rounding up

3328.559 --> 3332.4
i think it was a very interesting show

3331.04 --> 3334.96
today

3332.4 --> 3338.2400000000002
see i told you i feel good and when i

3334.96 --> 3340.64
say i feel good i mean it and the real

3338.24 --> 3342.4799999999996
stuff comes out this is actually what

3340.64 --> 3344.48
i'm supposed to be doing all the time

3342.48 --> 3346.799
it's just that sometimes it kind of

3344.48 --> 3348.72
crumble and i just can't do it i can't

3346.799 --> 3351.2
do it i can't focus

3348.72 --> 3351.2
i'm sorry

3352.16 --> 3356.0
but i can focus right now

3358.559 --> 3364.48
i've also seen crepuscular rays from

3360.96 --> 3364.48
above they are

3367.68 --> 3371.2799999999997
oh my god

3374.079 --> 3376.7200000000003
balls

3375.68 --> 3379.7599999999998
that's

3376.72 --> 3379.7599999999998
well it's balls

3380.48 --> 3385.599
yeah i guess what do you expect for

3382.48 --> 3387.92
somebody that calls themselves that but

3385.599 --> 3392.0
no it's not parallel the point about

3387.92 --> 3394.079
crepuscular is that it's not parallel

3392.0 --> 3397.119
this is ridiculous just like you're

3394.079 --> 3398.96
saying like no bent is straight that's

3397.119 --> 3402.04
what you're saying right now balls this

3398.96 --> 3402.04
is ridiculous

3404.88 --> 3410.6400000000003
it doesn't understand oh yes i don't

3408.64 --> 3412.799
understand oh our wind doesn't

3410.64 --> 3415.359
understand perspective get the [ __ ] out

3412.799 --> 3415.359
of here man

3416.559 --> 3422.3190000000004
it's so ridiculous i'm not even gonna

3418.16 --> 3425.2
ban you for that it's so dumb

3422.319 --> 3428.72
if anybody here understands on the scene

3425.2 --> 3428.72
freaking perspective it's me

3430.96 --> 3434.559
no you don't you don't know what you're

3432.799 --> 3436.0
talking about but you're just now at

3434.559 --> 3437.52
homing and [ __ ]

3436.0 --> 3439.76
so if you keep that up you don't

3437.52 --> 3442.0
actually try to

3439.76 --> 3444.3190000000004
productively engage in the in the

3442.0 --> 3447.839
subject at hand i will ban you okay

3444.319 --> 3450.0
balls i'm just gonna kick you

3447.839 --> 3453.48
right there

3450.0 --> 3453.48
it's up to you

3483.28 --> 3486.799
i'm giving you examples

3486.839 --> 3491.119
what

3488.64 --> 3492.96
no you're not giving examples did he

3491.119 --> 3495.52
give an example

3492.96 --> 3498.7200000000003
anywhere

3495.52 --> 3498.72
you're talking out of your

3500.839 --> 3508.88
balls crepuscular rays shining upwards

3505.599 --> 3511.119
through the cl what

3508.88 --> 3512.319
okay then balls

3511.119 --> 3517.2000000000003
okay

3512.319 --> 3519.7599999999998
oh balls hit dude i didn't even see that

3517.2 --> 3521.2799999999997
i can't believe he's saying that

3519.76 --> 3526.1600000000003
balls

3521.28 --> 3531.28
at 2 38 says i've also seen crepuscular

3526.16 --> 3533.359
rays shining upwards through clouds

3531.28 --> 3536.3190000000004
does that mean the sun was under the

3533.359 --> 3537.5989999999997
clouds on that occasion

3536.319 --> 3541.2799999999997
yeah

3537.599 --> 3543.119
yeah it does thanks for confessing

3541.28 --> 3544.6400000000003
that you've seen that

3543.119 --> 3548.559
that's hilarious

3544.64 --> 3548.5589999999997
that's freaking hilarious

3548.799 --> 3552.4
yeah

3549.92 --> 3554.4
because guess what

3552.4 --> 3556.079
sun is holographic it doesn't have an

3554.4 --> 3558.4
actual position

3556.079 --> 3559.28
as angular positions

3558.4 --> 3560.559
yeah

3559.28 --> 3562.7200000000003
it can

3560.559 --> 3564.48
literally be

3562.72 --> 3567.1189999999997
under the clouds

3564.48 --> 3569.04
shining its light in all directions from

3567.119 --> 3571.839
that angular point in relation to the

3569.04 --> 3575.839
observer including

3571.839 --> 3577.7599999999998
through the clouds upwards

3575.839 --> 3581.04
yeah

3577.76 --> 3583.96
can do anything like that all that yeah

3581.04 --> 3586.96
it can do that because because

3583.96 --> 3588.96
exclusively because it's holographic and

3586.96 --> 3591.839
not actually an object in a literal

3588.96 --> 3594.319
position it doesn't actually if it's not

3591.839 --> 3595.599
a physical thing going underneath the

3594.319 --> 3597.839
clouds

3595.599 --> 3600.96
it makes no sense nothing about that

3597.839 --> 3602.799
makes sense and in a heliocentric model

3600.96 --> 3605.68
that makes even less sense this is

3602.799 --> 3607.839
preposterous

3605.68 --> 3611.0789999999997
i can't believe you actually said that

3607.839 --> 3611.0789999999997
it's hilarious

3623.92 --> 3629.119
this is that's so funny

3626.16 --> 3629.839
i'm sorry dudes that's just so funny to

3629.119 --> 3632.0
me

3629.839 --> 3635.2799999999997
that he actually said that and thought

3632.0 --> 3638.64
he had some argue like

3635.28 --> 3638.6400000000003
like what the [ __ ] is this

3641.359 --> 3645.52
like oh

3643.76 --> 3647.599
i i don't even know how to give a

3645.52 --> 3650.24
metaphor to that it's so freaking

3647.599 --> 3650.2400000000002
hilarious

3652.319 --> 3655.319
ugh

3656.64 --> 3661.4
but i can't think of anything right now

3658.4 --> 3661.4
anyway

3678.4 --> 3684.7200000000003
no

3680.319 --> 3686.0
no it doesn't professor phil bell

3684.72 --> 3688.16
no it

3686.0 --> 3689.599
it behaves as neither

3688.16 --> 3691.92
not both

3689.599 --> 3695.3590000000004
it's not a particle

3691.92 --> 3696.839
it's an infinitely divisible beam

3695.359 --> 3699.68
can split up

3696.839 --> 3703.04
infinitely it's not bound by any

3699.68 --> 3705.359
material minimum yeah it's not a

3703.04 --> 3707.119
particle but you can think of it as a

3705.359 --> 3709.359
particle you can calculate it as a

3707.119 --> 3713.359
particle but when you do you're going to

3709.359 --> 3715.7599999999998
bump into some weird little things

3713.359 --> 3718.4
especially in the end registration of

3715.76 --> 3720.559
the light when you reabsorb it in order

3718.4 --> 3722.319
to establish anything right because the

3720.559 --> 3724.88
only way you can detect light is by

3722.319 --> 3728.16
absorbing it yeah

3724.88 --> 3731.2000000000003
and absorption means matter

3728.16 --> 3734.799
physical matter opaque matter absorbing

3731.2 --> 3739.2799999999997
it right and matter guess what

3734.799 --> 3742.0
has a limited size it is a particle

3739.28 --> 3744.1600000000003
so you can't even pick up how small

3742.0 --> 3746.079
light could be

3744.16 --> 3748.48
how much it can split up you simply

3746.079 --> 3750.0
won't be able to register it anymore

3748.48 --> 3750.88
it's pretty pretty sure it's there

3750.0 --> 3752.72
though

3750.88 --> 3755.039
because it's not a particle it doesn't

3752.72 --> 3757.359
stick to a minimum size

3755.039 --> 3760.0
that's why you can do all these amazing

3757.359 --> 3763.7599999999998
things with light that's why you can

3760.0 --> 3766.88
split it up in a rainbow with a prism

3763.76 --> 3771.119
makes no freaking sense at all if they

3766.88 --> 3773.359
were all minimum sized units

3771.119 --> 3777.88
that makes absolutely no sense

3773.359 --> 3777.88
whatsoever if that were the case

3787.68 --> 3790.0
right

3788.48 --> 3791.359
light is not a

3790.0 --> 3794.24
particle

3791.359 --> 3796.72
in the sense of how matter

3794.24 --> 3798.5589999999997
consists of particles it's not what it

3796.72 --> 3801.1189999999997
is

3798.559 --> 3803.2000000000003
it's something that is of a completely

3801.119 --> 3805.839
different nature

3803.2 --> 3808.319
it's not physical matter light is not

3805.839 --> 3810.88
physical matter i don't care

3808.319 --> 3813.68
how einstein and all these other

3810.88 --> 3815.28
whatever people

3813.68 --> 3817.9199999999996
supposed

3815.28 --> 3819.76
physicists or theoretical physicists or

3817.92 --> 3820.44
whatever

3819.76 --> 3822.1600000000003
as

3820.44 --> 3824.48
astrophysicists

3822.16 --> 3826.96
how they speculate that it's all the

3824.48 --> 3831.039
same thing on the same letter no it

3826.96 --> 3831.039
isn't it's completely different

3831.52 --> 3836.0
just because one comes out of the other

3833.68 --> 3838.72
doesn't make it the same substance it

3836.0 --> 3843.599
isn't it just isn't it's completely

3838.72 --> 3843.5989999999997
different doesn't behave anything alike

3845.119 --> 3850.0
it's all over simplification light is of

3848.0 --> 3851.039
a different nature it's of a different

3850.0 --> 3854.24
class

3851.039 --> 3854.2400000000002
as physical matter

3854.88 --> 3860.6800000000003
and it doesn't abide to the same

3857.68 --> 3860.68
patterns

3878.0 --> 3884.64
function is not a wave

3881.2 --> 3886.799
no that's just an extracted calculation

3884.64 --> 3888.8799999999997
a wave function

3886.799 --> 3890.319
it's not actually a wave either right

3888.88 --> 3892.799
because then it wouldn't even be

3890.319 --> 3892.799
anything

3893.039 --> 3897.2000000000003
waves

3894.48 --> 3899.359
are not a thing

3897.2 --> 3902.48
waves are patterns that

3899.359 --> 3905.2799999999997
something is subjected to

3902.48 --> 3906.799
it's secondary it's an effect it's not

3905.28 --> 3910.0
the substance

3906.799 --> 3910.799
so it's not a wave

3910.0 --> 3914.0
isn't

3910.799 --> 3915.28
it's a mistaking assumption that it is

3914.0 --> 3917.28
like a wave

3915.28 --> 3918.4
but yeah you can approach the whole wave

3917.28 --> 3921.599
idea

3918.4 --> 3924.2400000000002
very differently as well if you

3921.599 --> 3926.1600000000003
figure out

3924.24 --> 3928.8799999999997
what's going to happen if it was

3926.16 --> 3931.839
infinitely divisible beams

3928.88 --> 3933.92
that can literally split up

3931.839 --> 3936.48
infinitely

3933.92 --> 3939.359
with no minimum size

3936.48 --> 3940.559
and yeah you'll find

3939.359 --> 3943.119
that that

3940.559 --> 3944.6400000000003
kind of explains how that's possible

3943.119 --> 3946.079
because then

3944.64 --> 3948.4
you get

3946.079 --> 3951.3590000000004
beam combination

3948.4 --> 3953.6800000000003
to gain at certain points the critical

3951.359 --> 3955.839
mass in order to manifest anything but

3953.68 --> 3957.68
it doesn't mean that it doesn't manifest

3955.839 --> 3960.0789999999997
on the other spots it just means it

3957.68 --> 3963.5989999999997
doesn't attain enough energy

3960.079 --> 3967.28
at the point of arrival to actually make

3963.599 --> 3970.48
the material switch and register it

3967.28 --> 3970.48
that's the difference

3971.44 --> 3978.64
because for light absorption

3974.4 --> 3982.1600000000003
it's always dependent on the material

3978.64 --> 3986.0789999999997
and how sensitive it really is

3982.16 --> 3987.5989999999997
to atomic scale and an atom is a limited

3986.079 --> 3990.0
size

3987.599 --> 3991.039
at some point there's no smaller than

3990.0 --> 3994.4
that

3991.039 --> 3997.5200000000004
yet light beams can infinitely

3994.4 --> 3997.52
infinitely small

3997.76 --> 4001.28
but there's no way to physically

3999.839 --> 4004.0
register that

4001.28 --> 4006.7200000000003
except you can deduce it

4004.0 --> 4009.599
by combining just several smaller

4006.72 --> 4012.0789999999997
amounts that are not enough to register

4009.599 --> 4014.48
separately combine them with the same

4012.079 --> 4016.88
target spot and then they will register

4014.48 --> 4019.52
even though the

4016.88 --> 4022.799
the firing off of it

4019.52 --> 4025.68
for each singular micro beam would not

4022.799 --> 4027.839
be enough to register but if you combine

4025.68 --> 4031.68
them on the same location then it is

4027.839 --> 4031.68
enough to register that's the

4032.079 --> 4035.52
the

4032.839 --> 4037.44
observation thingy that cannot be called

4035.52 --> 4040.0
a test or a hypothesis

4037.44 --> 4041.76
whatever experiment that it isn't

4040.0 --> 4044.319
that's what i have

4041.76 --> 4045.2000000000003
suggested in in order to figure that one

4044.319 --> 4047.2799999999997
out

4045.2 --> 4049.68
to basically find some kind of

4047.28 --> 4052.559
potential backing to yes something

4049.68 --> 4054.5589999999997
that's already a claim like yeah

4052.559 --> 4056.7200000000003
you can't register it because it gets

4054.559 --> 4058.1600000000003
too small right well there is ways to

4056.72 --> 4060.16
kind of like

4058.16 --> 4062.8799999999997
figure out how that works

4060.16 --> 4064.72
and i'm very curious to if that's gonna

4062.88 --> 4067.039
be if somebody's gonna do that at some

4064.72 --> 4067.0389999999998
point

4074.64 --> 4079.0389999999998
perpetu no it's not

4076.559 --> 4081.3590000000004
no ether is not anything

4079.039 --> 4082.88
it's a fictional medium based on the

4081.359 --> 4085.68
misunderstanding

4082.88 --> 4089.359
of light to be a secondary thing if you

4085.68 --> 4091.52
just realize it's infinitely small

4089.359 --> 4093.2799999999997
potentially infinite

4091.52 --> 4096.0
small beams

4093.28 --> 4098.88
and they're instantaneous

4096.0 --> 4101.359
it's just it's not matter don't compare

4098.88 --> 4104.159000000001
it to matter it's not matter it doesn't

4101.359 --> 4107.759
work like matter

4104.159 --> 4108.879999999999
no need for wave waves are a matter

4107.759 --> 4109.92
thing

4108.88 --> 4111.359
matter

4109.92 --> 4114.159
has waves

4111.359 --> 4114.159000000001
light does not

4114.799 --> 4121.44
it doesn't need a medium

4118.56 --> 4121.4400000000005
it's just light

4122.159 --> 4126.879999999999
don't bring in your ether theory it's

4124.64 --> 4129.279
just light ether is just

4126.88 --> 4129.279
way

4129.359 --> 4135.04
way outside of scientific territory here

4131.679 --> 4137.92
this no it isn't it is not light ether

4135.04 --> 4139.359
this is electric ether for sure light

4137.92 --> 4142.359
ether no it's not that's a

4139.359 --> 4142.359
misunderstanding

4155.12 --> 4162.48
can't just conjure up in like

4158.4 --> 4164.879999999999
a medium just to try to abide to the

4162.48 --> 4168.919999999999
convenience of the idea that light could

4164.88 --> 4168.92
be a wave it isn't

4189.279 --> 4194.96
huh hello by the way la mel forever good

4192.48 --> 4197.919999999999
to see you i haven't seen you in a while

4194.96 --> 4197.92
hope you're doing all right

4198.239 --> 4202.839999999999
so yeah the chat is definitely

4205.04 --> 4208.04
booming

4221.04 --> 4226.239
wow llp yeah you literally just yeah

4227.679 --> 4234.0
dude yeah you said it exactly right

4229.84 --> 4234.0
there as i said it but yes that's

4235.76 --> 4239.92
that was my proposition

4238.719 --> 4242.4800000000005
yeah

4239.92 --> 4245.1990000000005
right it's not a particle

4242.48 --> 4248.639999999999
but yeah if the amount of energy output

4245.199 --> 4252.0
just is not enough for photos sensitive

4248.64 --> 4254.159000000001
material to make that switch to register

4252.0 --> 4257.52
then it's just not going to do anything

4254.159 --> 4259.5199999999995
but if you take like half a photons

4257.52 --> 4260.4800000000005
worth of energy

4259.52 --> 4262.88
beam

4260.48 --> 4265.36
a dig two of them and point them

4262.88 --> 4268.719
directly at the same spot

4265.36 --> 4270.799999999999
then combined it will register as if it

4268.719 --> 4273.28
is one photon even though it's two beams

4270.8 --> 4276.159000000001
and separately they don't register right

4273.28 --> 4278.719
that would be my proof of infinitely

4276.159 --> 4280.719
divisible beams of light

4278.719 --> 4284.719
it doesn't have a minimum side it just

4280.719 --> 4287.76
needs a minimum amount of energy quanta

4284.719 --> 4291.28
in order to be registered

4287.76 --> 4296.360000000001
in material which has a minimum size

4291.28 --> 4296.36
molecules atoms have a minimum size

4306.0 --> 4312.12
how to solar cells i'm not gonna get

4308.48 --> 4312.12
into that right now

4317.76 --> 4322.159000000001
that's like

4320.0 --> 4323.36
but it's pretty much based on the same

4322.159 --> 4324.159
thing

4323.36 --> 4326.88
right

4324.159 --> 4329.12
it absorbs the energy and that kind of

4326.88 --> 4330.56
like changes the polarization or

4329.12 --> 4333.5199999999995
something of the matter and then

4330.56 --> 4336.56
eventually it starts to just

4333.52 --> 4338.56
give off electrons you could say that

4336.56 --> 4340.0
maybe i got it slightly wrong i'm not

4338.56 --> 4343.120000000001
like an electric

4340.0 --> 4344.8
specialist right

4343.12 --> 4346.64
like the sunlight

4344.8 --> 4350.2390000000005
the beams

4346.64 --> 4354.0
are being absorbed by the matter

4350.239 --> 4355.839999999999
they then translate into electrons

4354.0 --> 4358.48
and then eventually it charges up and

4355.84 --> 4360.08
then the electrons like move off they're

4358.48 --> 4362.08
guided

4360.08 --> 4363.92
through the electric pathway and that

4362.08 --> 4366.32
yeah generates the electricity so it's

4363.92 --> 4369.32
like sun literally transforming into

4366.32 --> 4369.32
electricity

4370.64 --> 4375.04
right but it's going through matter so

4373.199 --> 4378.08
it's always going to require a minimum

4375.04 --> 4381.44
amount of energy in order to

4378.08 --> 4384.64
create those electrons

4381.44 --> 4386.4
i guess one could say that well maybe

4384.64 --> 4389.04
electrons kind of abide by the same

4386.4 --> 4391.679
principle right because it might like

4389.04 --> 4394.56
store half an electron worth of energy

4391.679 --> 4397.1990000000005
it's not gonna then do anything

4394.56 --> 4399.52
but you require another half and then

4397.199 --> 4401.839999999999
the electron gets

4399.52 --> 4404.56
in yeah it becomes polarized enough that

4401.84 --> 4406.8
the electron actually moves away that it

4404.56 --> 4410.0
is able to react

4406.8 --> 4410.0
and be guided off

4410.48 --> 4414.4
so maybe the same goes for electrons

4412.88 --> 4416.64
like you might have like half an

4414.4 --> 4420.719
electron worth of energy

4416.64 --> 4420.719
but like how do you register that

4423.36 --> 4428.32
that yeah this is

4425.44 --> 4431.199
kind of blowing my mind right now

4428.32 --> 4432.799999999999
i yeah i can't do that all in like

4431.199 --> 4434.48
two minutes

4432.8 --> 4436.8
but it is interesting

4434.48 --> 4439.839999999999
to think about these things and i i

4436.8 --> 4442.2390000000005
appreciate my idea

4439.84 --> 4444.08
infinitely divisible beams

4442.239 --> 4446.159
i mean i seem to be

4444.08 --> 4448.88
one of the few everybody else is for the

4446.159 --> 4449.839999999999
moon it's ridiculous it's particles

4448.88 --> 4451.52
because

4449.84 --> 4453.84
some physicists

4451.52 --> 4455.6
a whole bunch of time ago said it is and

4453.84 --> 4457.04
they got quantum mechanics and it means

4455.6 --> 4458.88
it is me

4457.04 --> 4460.48
yeah sorry there's nothing i can do with

4458.88 --> 4462.08
that

4460.48 --> 4464.718999999999
and i'm gonna go into discussion with

4462.08 --> 4466.84
people that are going to address my

4464.719 --> 4470.08
ideas like

4466.84 --> 4472.400000000001
that so yeah that's why i stick to the

4470.08 --> 4475.04
early bird show most of the time

4472.4 --> 4477.839999999999
where some people actually can

4475.04 --> 4480.88
find some room inside of their minds to

4477.84 --> 4484.0
entertain the ideas that i have

4480.88 --> 4486.4800000000005
and yeah realize yeah you can test these

4484.0 --> 4488.4
things i don't just make up [ __ ] that's

4486.48 --> 4491.12
not a testable

4488.4 --> 4493.679
i'm always trying to figure out if i got

4491.12 --> 4495.36
a conception how do you test it how do

4493.679 --> 4498.64
you actually

4495.36 --> 4500.799999999999
get to prove anything about it

4498.64 --> 4504.0
i don't just assert things that are

4500.8 --> 4507.1990000000005
unimprovable like dark matter which is a

4504.0 --> 4509.52
per definition unprovable it's only the

4507.199 --> 4511.12
end result of a calculation it's dark

4509.52 --> 4513.84
matter because it has to be because

4511.12 --> 4517.44
otherwise nothing makes sense yeah well

4513.84 --> 4519.4400000000005
that can never be proven then ever

4517.44 --> 4521.199
it's not supposed to be provable it's

4519.44 --> 4523.599999999999
just supposed to be

4521.199 --> 4526.159
like this is what it is it has to be or

4523.6 --> 4527.92
nothing works that's it well that's not

4526.159 --> 4530.239
proven then at all it just means that

4527.92 --> 4531.84
everything is wrong and you're too lazy

4530.239 --> 4533.678999999999
to figure out

4531.84 --> 4535.52
how to fix it

4533.679 --> 4537.6
other than that

4535.52 --> 4538.96
that's what that means right that's not

4537.6 --> 4542.56
what i do

4538.96 --> 4546.8
i try to always find a falsifiable

4542.56 --> 4546.8
nature for the ideas that i have

4548.159 --> 4551.5199999999995
yeah i've already addressed that bad

4549.84 --> 4553.52
karma half my

4551.52 --> 4555.360000000001
what am i saying my entire show was

4553.52 --> 4556.88
about that i'm not gonna do that in the

4555.36 --> 4558.48
last minute

4556.88 --> 4560.719
you're gonna just have to watch back the

4558.48 --> 4563.04
show if you wanna answer to that

4560.719 --> 4564.719
question

4563.04 --> 4567.199
right anyway

4564.719 --> 4569.52
thanks everybody for coming

4567.199 --> 4571.5199999999995
if you like this show and i think this

4569.52 --> 4573.360000000001
was a really good one

4571.52 --> 4575.360000000001
if you liked it too then please don't

4573.36 --> 4577.28

flat earth early bird number 1108

4610.32 --> 4613.92
and i'm going to join the flat earth

4611.52 --> 4617.120000000001
debate which has just now started up so

4613.92 --> 4617.12
i'll see you there in chat

4617.6 --> 4623.22
