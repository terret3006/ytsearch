back

109.04 --> 118.84
there it's part of the main

112.719 --> 123.15899999999999
panel right so anyway weather today

118.84 --> 125.759
is the same as yesterday it's a bit more

123.159 --> 128.959
windy was a little bit of sunshine

125.759 --> 132.16
earlier that was kind of nice but

128.959 --> 136.04
yeah got covered by the clouds

132.16 --> 136.04
again but yeah it's a bit

140.16 --> 143.4
windy that's

144.2 --> 149.879
it couple of raindrops may have been

147.4 --> 153.31900000000002
falling during the night there's some

149.879 --> 153.319
pools over there on the

154.0 --> 158.879
street I haven't really noticed it that

156.519 --> 159.92000000000002
much it's not like been full on raining

158.879 --> 163.44
at

159.92 --> 163.44
least right

178.76 --> 181.76
anyhow

183.44 --> 191.4
right

185.159 --> 191.39999999999998
so oh it's Friday the 26th of January

195.319 --> 199.79899999999998
2024 temperature 9°

201.519 --> 208.68
C oh says now tomorrow it's going to be

206.159 --> 211.67999999999998
a fully sunny day that's

208.68 --> 211.68
nice

215.879 --> 221.0
Saturday cool down a

218.36 --> 222.87900000000002
little but with a lot of sun so that's

221.0 --> 225.0
really nice going to make sure to go to

222.879 --> 228.07999999999998
bed on time

225.0 --> 229.36
today so that I can catch as much of

228.08 --> 232.72
that as

229.36 --> 232.72000000000003
I can

238.68 --> 241.68
tomorrow

243.2 --> 248.159
hello slowmo moon buggy first in chat

245.64 --> 248.159
good to see

249.239 --> 252.239
you

260.32 --> 264.59999999999997
right so yesterday

265.24 --> 271.039
I show was pretty

267.759 --> 272.72
long my shows have been pretty long

271.039 --> 276.199
recently hey

272.72 --> 278.56
doons and then I like went onto Discord

276.199 --> 279.88
to like check on what was going on over

278.56 --> 283.639
at Nathan

279.88 --> 283.639
Oakley's in the after

283.72 --> 291.40000000000003
show but yeah it was still going

287.919 --> 292.52
and guys in there in G+ said hello and

291.4 --> 295.35999999999996
all

292.52 --> 298.52
that but then like I don't know what the

295.36 --> 298.52000000000004
hell is going on man

298.56 --> 305.039
but like Nathan is like outlining a new

302.56 --> 306.6
policy where basically everything that I

305.039 --> 309.08
do is all

306.6 --> 314.16
now off the

309.08 --> 316.75899999999996
table and he's like every freaking

314.16 --> 321.12
time I'm

316.759 --> 323.16
there he talks about that [ __ ] it's I

321.12 --> 325.759
really feel like he's like on purpose

323.16 --> 328.6
trying to repel me or

325.759 --> 330.52000000000004
something cuz I had to like stick up for

328.6 --> 332.52000000000004
that he said

330.52 --> 335.24
Nathan now says like you are not

332.52 --> 338.84
supposed to

335.24 --> 341.44
speculate about what you don't

338.84 --> 344.79999999999995
know I mean I didn't literally say it

341.44 --> 347.319
but can I say a go [ __ ]

344.8 --> 352.52000000000004
yourself that is what I

347.319 --> 355.319
do that's been my unique [ __ ]

352.52 --> 361.479
thing I'm not going to stop doing that

355.319 --> 361.47900000000004
to become one of your drones Nathan

362.199 --> 368.199
yeah and hey if I'm in the middle of a

365.039 --> 369.84
debate with a balart arguing about oh no

368.199 --> 371.91900000000004
the Earth is Globe no it's flat hair is

369.84 --> 374.56
why yeah I'm not going to bring up oh

371.919 --> 376.68
what could be because it's not relevant

374.56 --> 379.759
to that but that doesn't mean

376.68 --> 381.72
that can't just talk about that of

379.759 --> 384.08000000000004
course I can people wonder about these

381.72 --> 384.08000000000004
things

384.28 --> 390.96
and

386.08 --> 392.56
I'm giving them some pointers

390.96 --> 396.12
and there's absolutely nothing wrong

392.56 --> 396.12
with that it's actually filling a

397.72 --> 406.68
void so yeah that was kind of

402.319 --> 406.68
unpleasant hey Richard G good see you

410.639 --> 417.72
Tommy but yeah after that that all

414.319 --> 421.199
stopped I hung around even in the after

417.72 --> 423.8
after show on the Discord and had a

421.199 --> 427.8
bunch of conversations with the guys in

423.8 --> 432.16
there have a bit of a spat with

427.8 --> 434.96000000000004
the with um damn it what's his name

432.16 --> 437.28000000000003
again with Sasha because I thought he

434.96 --> 439.599
was like really trolling me but it was

437.28 --> 441.599
my mistake I was basically all W wound

439.599 --> 445.08
up and paranoid from everything that was

441.599 --> 447.28
just happening before that but we talked

445.08 --> 447.28
it

447.919 --> 453.79999999999995
out I thought was trolling me really bad

450.96 --> 455.68
but it wasn't and he was really shocked

453.8 --> 458.879
because he didn't mean to it was

455.68 --> 461.12
just posted a little video and I thought

458.879 --> 463.56
it was me on

461.12 --> 465.199
there it kind of looked like from the

463.56 --> 467.08
steel frame and

465.199 --> 470.28000000000003
I was

467.08 --> 472.479
just I guess High sensitive paranoid and

470.28 --> 473.35999999999996
it didn't investigate further went off

472.479 --> 476.199
on

473.36 --> 478.72
him that was kind of stupid once I

476.199 --> 481.319
figured out like no no that's definitely

478.72 --> 481.319
not that big

481.919 --> 489.68
video right but we talked that out and

485.96 --> 492.479
then afterward uh one of the guys

489.68 --> 493.72
there two of the guys were talking about

492.479 --> 497.28
like

493.72 --> 498.68
oh magnetic north and Celestial North

497.28 --> 501.67999999999995
are the same

498.68 --> 501.68
thing

501.759 --> 505.56
ridiculous and so then I started

503.919 --> 506.639
explaining like no it's definitely not

505.56 --> 509.319
the same

506.639 --> 511.0
thing and it made the title because it

509.319 --> 513.919
was kind of an interesting conversation

511.0 --> 516.44
a lot of people don't really know

513.919 --> 519.4789999999999
this that Celestial

516.44 --> 522.5600000000001
North besides a cardinal direction which

519.479 --> 525.08
means absolute and parallel to

522.56 --> 525.0799999999999
everywhere

526.6 --> 534.16
else where

529.399 --> 535.76
Polaris is where its GP is or supposed

534.16 --> 538.1999999999999
to be if you can even get there there's

535.76 --> 540.92
no direct

538.2 --> 543.8000000000001
confirmation it's a line it's not a

540.92 --> 545.959
point and this is very tricky it's a

543.8 --> 550.519
it's because of physicality assumption

545.959 --> 552.3599999999999
bias and the dis map that this is very

550.519 --> 553.88
confusing for

552.36 --> 559.5600000000001
people

553.88 --> 562.8
because the latitude lines derived from

559.56 --> 562.8
angles with

563.16 --> 569.519
Polaris are

565.68 --> 573.2399999999999
lines right but then you look at at

569.519 --> 575.399
Polaris and it's like oh it's a DOT and

573.24 --> 578.399
everything seems to be spinning around

575.399 --> 581.32
it and if I move e West it's like oh

578.399 --> 584.16
yeah so if you presuppose that is there

581.32 --> 584.1600000000001
a point at the

584.6 --> 590.24
center then you just think of it like

587.92 --> 592.279
that and then the dis map is like oh

590.24 --> 595.839
yeah that makes perfect sense but in

592.279 --> 599.279
reality that's not actually how it's

595.839 --> 604.0
derived it's a line all latitude lines

599.279 --> 607.24
including Polaris GP point is a line

604.0 --> 609.839
it's a line above you and theoretically

607.24 --> 611.72
yeah if you go far enough North that

609.839 --> 615.519
Polaris goes straight above you you

611.72 --> 621.24
should be able to walk east and west and

615.519 --> 625.5600000000001
then Polaris would remain directly above

621.24 --> 628.48
you yeah cuz the GP would be a line and

625.56 --> 631.0
yeah there is no logical way to explain

628.48 --> 634.279
that

631.0 --> 636.519
if you're going to have any kind of like

634.279 --> 640.04
predisposition physicality assumption

636.519 --> 642.48
bias about that the stars are physically

640.04 --> 646.079
there somehow above

642.48 --> 648.76
us spinning directly above us like that

646.079 --> 651.6389999999999
goes out of the door because how could

648.76 --> 653.639
you go east and

651.639 --> 655.92
west the

653.639 --> 658.04
H

655.92 --> 661.04
wrong oh

658.04 --> 661.04
cool

663.12 --> 667.9590000000001
okay that's not the real PG to get the

665.48 --> 667.9590000000001
hell out of

675.0 --> 681.079
here

676.959 --> 681.079
yeah no dummy

685.2 --> 691.6
dumbass never it's it's early I'll give

688.68 --> 691.5999999999999
it it's

694.079 --> 701.4399999999999
okay now PJ kushank is definitely not

697.72 --> 701.44
the robot guy from Red

715.12 --> 720.9590000000001
Dwarf he has his own

717.959 --> 720.959
photograph

733.12 --> 739.68
talking to a guy who says Celestial

735.68 --> 744.6389999999999
lights are the South Pole

739.68 --> 744.6389999999999
travel are the South

747.88 --> 750.88
what

752.6 --> 759.16
he's got a new I don't it's not PJ Kack

756.24 --> 759.16
there would have been more

760.079 --> 764.079
history joined one year

777.839 --> 782.12
ago

779.72 --> 787.76
no

782.12 --> 790.48
activity joined January 22nd 2023 yeah I

787.76 --> 794.519
mean PJ K's been around a little bit

790.48 --> 794.519
longer so this is absolute

802.6 --> 805.9590000000001
nonsense told

807.76 --> 810.76
you

814.36 --> 816.6
all

822.959 --> 830.68
right right but anyhow yeah went over to

826.76 --> 830.68
Fed it did not feel

835.399 --> 844.04
good might that like because oh I'll

841.519 --> 848.24
only go back if I get

844.04 --> 850.959
500 that's to be just part of the G+

848.24 --> 852.6
like to be part of the main group and to

850.959 --> 855.0
do all

852.6 --> 858.88
that but I mean that doesn't mean that I

855.0 --> 858.88
can't just like come over and take a

858.959 --> 865.079
look I'm just not going to like do

861.88 --> 867.68
housekeeping or Ballwin or any of that

865.079 --> 870.68
like yeah that that's

867.68 --> 870.68
cute

871.32 --> 874.279
now that that's going to

874.56 --> 879.8389999999999
cost how can a GP be a line well GP is a

878.279 --> 885.56
line

879.839 --> 888.5600000000001
everywhere all GP points are on a line

885.56 --> 892.5189999999999
why because this apparent celestial

888.56 --> 897.68
sphere is always rotating over

892.519 --> 900.519
time so every Star has a GP Point

897.68 --> 903.519
underneath

900.519 --> 905.9590000000001
it but it's effectively a line because

903.519 --> 911.519
it's going to be right above

905.959 --> 916.6389999999999
you over that line it's basically a line

911.519 --> 916.639
the GP point is always going to be on a

916.959 --> 924.04
line right first it's a GP point above

920.48 --> 926.9200000000001
this point on the line and then oh time

924.04 --> 929.199
passes and now it's going to be the GP

926.92 --> 930.759
point on this line because it

929.199 --> 933.7589999999999
moved

930.759 --> 933.759
above

934.04 --> 941.199
there on the line that's

937.0 --> 945.68
right and so is the Polaris GP

941.199 --> 945.68
point now it may not be

946.519 --> 953.6
moving but even if you'd move East and

949.48 --> 956.9590000000001
West it still remain directly above

953.6 --> 961.36
you line another line okay there's

956.959 --> 961.3599999999999
some n trolls in here

966.319 --> 972.959
today we aren't traveling cir around

981.36 --> 986.04
continents

983.0 --> 988.24
looping what do you mean if we weren't

986.04 --> 990.519
traveling circles around continents how

988.24 --> 990.519
is that

991.279 --> 994.319
how does that make

992.32 --> 999.0790000000001
[Music]

994.319 --> 1003.8
looping no loop de I don't get

999.079 --> 1008.199
it looping is the state of the entire

1003.8 --> 1010.959
realm moving around in the realm doesn't

1008.199 --> 1010.959
disprove

1012.24 --> 1015.24
that

1015.36 --> 1025.039
right only there not being a

1020.12 --> 1027.0
Loop would be proof because if you move

1025.039 --> 1028.72
in a straight line eventually you bump

1027.0 --> 1032.0
into something that prevents you from

1028.72 --> 1034.799
moving further yeah that's that's how

1032.0 --> 1034.799
you disprove

1036.72 --> 1042.6000000000001
looping yeah and you you measure these

1040.079 --> 1045.6789999999999
Celestial

1042.6 --> 1048.9189999999999
lines the latitude lines like the

1045.679 --> 1052.3200000000002
equator what is it what is it

1048.919 --> 1056.24
actually physically I mean yeah it's

1052.32 --> 1059.799
derived but what will it amount to on

1056.24 --> 1061.559
the earth is it is it actually a circle

1059.799 --> 1065.84
or is it a straight

1061.559 --> 1069.44
line I mean we still this information is

1065.84 --> 1072.28
elusive I still haven't caught I've been

1069.44 --> 1074.3200000000002
asking that question for like half a

1072.28 --> 1077.3999999999999
decade by

1074.32 --> 1081.1589999999999
now nobody's

1077.4 --> 1085.8400000000001
providing nobody has anything

1081.159 --> 1085.8400000000001
there and so that will remain

1094.159 --> 1099.2800000000002
inconclusive if you left the coast of

1096.559 --> 1102.6399999999999
California and head up to

1099.28 --> 1104.84
Japan straight or take a hard right uh

1102.64 --> 1108.7990000000002
well blue P

1104.84 --> 1114.36
Devolution technically all travel t to

1108.799 --> 1117.8799999999999
like want to move relatively close to

1114.36 --> 1119.84
land because going straight across the

1117.88 --> 1123.0800000000002
ocean is more

1119.84 --> 1125.039
risky and the farther away in the ocean

1123.08 --> 1129.28
you go like

1125.039 --> 1132.28
the the more risk of like

1129.28 --> 1132.28
communication

1133.2 --> 1139.8400000000001
issues so that's what I think is part of

1137.559 --> 1144.1589999999999
the policy of the flight routs is just

1139.84 --> 1148.039
like just don't dead reckoning cross

1144.159 --> 1151.4
huge oceans with airplanes I mean with

1148.039 --> 1154.6
boats they might do that sort of but

1151.4 --> 1161.2800000000002
with airplanes

1154.6 --> 1165.6
no they like to kind of stay close to S

1161.28 --> 1167.24
Mainland so they tend to like go north

1165.6 --> 1170.24
go in an

1167.24 --> 1170.24
arc

1174.52 --> 1178.12
is different

1179.799 --> 1185.96
yes yeah with a Y they do actually just

1183.0 --> 1185.96
directly cross the

1197.24 --> 1200.24
ocean

1202.799 --> 1209.36
it's just that air

1206.64 --> 1212.5200000000002
traffic this yeah they're not super

1209.36 --> 1214.559
eager to just always cross giant

1212.52 --> 1217.76
oceans if they

1214.559 --> 1221.12
can't like take just slightly longer and

1217.76 --> 1221.12
maneuver past land a

1227.159 --> 1230.159
bit

1249.76 --> 1254.36
six hour flight yeah that's that's quite

1252.2 --> 1254.3600000000001
a

1257.12 --> 1260.12
lot

1269.6 --> 1275.12
H fls use great circles I'm sure they

1275.36 --> 1281.36
do I'm also quite certain that flights

1278.279 --> 1286.32
on average like to fly in straight

1281.36 --> 1286.32
lines and not continually

1287.039 --> 1290.039
arcing

1290.64 --> 1296.76
because actually flying in precise

1293.72 --> 1301.559
circles is inconvenient while flying in

1296.76 --> 1305.84
a dead dead on straight line

1301.559 --> 1305.84
is like literally

1312.88 --> 1320.0390000000002
effortless that's what a great circle

1317.039 --> 1320.039
is

1330.279 --> 1337.76
okay Power L explanation C

1334.76 --> 1339.6
navigation okay I don't know what his

1337.76 --> 1342.6
explanation I know there's this whole

1339.6 --> 1344.52
flight path thing out there that's like

1342.6 --> 1346.9599999999998
oh it's a disc it's a disc see it's a

1344.52 --> 1348.559
straight line from here to there on the

1346.96 --> 1350.919
disc

1348.559 --> 1350.9189999999999
that's

1354.159 --> 1360.6000000000001
cute do they actually fly a straight

1357.88 --> 1363.5590000000002
line or just that's what it looks like

1360.6 --> 1367.0
on that map projection that's with

1363.559 --> 1371.0
inconsistent scales right so it's not

1367.0 --> 1371.0
really a real representation

1376.96 --> 1379.96
anyway

1399.279 --> 1404.48
what this must be from some time ago I

1402.0 --> 1406.88
don't even remember that blue build

1404.48 --> 1408.72
Evolution although I wasn't really like

1406.88 --> 1411.3200000000002
paying too much attention know what math

1408.72 --> 1411.32
powerland was

1412.52 --> 1417.9189999999999
doing at the

1415.6 --> 1422.76
time this a lot of it just seemed kind

1417.919 --> 1422.76
of attention grabby and Goofy and

1423.559 --> 1429.36
yeah were more interesting sources for

1426.64 --> 1429.3600000000001
me to tap

1432.0 --> 1439.159
into going around in circles doesn't

1434.88 --> 1442.0800000000002
make the room a ball yeah well and going

1439.159 --> 1444.0
around in dead on straight lines and

1442.08 --> 1447.24
then ending up at the place you started

1444.0 --> 1447.24
doesn't make it a ball

1466.799 --> 1469.799
either

1472.76 --> 1476.919
you understand my idea yeah I know you

1478.08 --> 1485.6789999999999
do the problem is is there's all these

1481.0 --> 1489.159
ideas out there that are just like

1485.679 --> 1493.24
really presupposing certain things they

1489.159 --> 1495.0
just don't preface that part and that's

1493.24 --> 1498.88
like the universal problem with flat

1495.0 --> 1503.039
earthers in the last eight years is that

1498.88 --> 1504.8400000000001
none of them know what prefacing even is

1503.039 --> 1506.76
it's just like oh this is it and they

1504.84 --> 1508.6789999999999
don't even know what it is that they're

1506.76 --> 1512.84
assuming while they do

1508.679 --> 1512.8400000000001
it you have to point it out to

1515.36 --> 1522.6399999999999
them so there's a lot of that especially

1518.2 --> 1524.52
in the beginning 2015 16 17 where a lot

1522.64 --> 1528.6000000000001
of flat earther were just throwing out

1524.52 --> 1531.08
ideas and they didn't know what

1528.6 --> 1534.4399999999998
what they were even assuming within it

1531.08 --> 1534.4399999999998
they didn't even see that

1534.76 --> 1540.2
properly people would also roll out like

1537.64 --> 1543.7990000000002
fundamentally conflicting ideas like oh

1540.2 --> 1547.96
look at this about the flight past and

1543.799 --> 1547.96
look at some other

1548.559 --> 1554.24
thing and they

1550.76 --> 1556.72
just they're like using different ideas

1554.24 --> 1559.96
it's a bad example I can't think of one

1556.72 --> 1562.559
direct example problem is like certain

1559.96 --> 1565.279
arguments just end up

1562.559 --> 1568.9189999999999
conflicting because they're based on

1565.279 --> 1568.919
certain types of

1569.36 --> 1575.12
presuppositions like about the celestial

1572.36 --> 1577.4799999999998
lights literally being over a dis kind

1575.12 --> 1581.4799999999998
of thing like the celestial North Pole

1577.48 --> 1581.48
being a point at the center of a

1584.799 --> 1591.0
disc right but the reality is is that

1588.52 --> 1593.399
Celestial North

1591.0 --> 1596.96
technically if you look at what it

1593.399 --> 1600.2399999999998
actually all is and what latitude lines

1596.96 --> 1603.88
are like they're they're lines

1600.24 --> 1607.3990000000001
yeah and the celestial

1603.88 --> 1610.96
North where Polaris is at directly above

1607.399 --> 1614.6789999999999
you should also be a line

1610.96 --> 1618.159
logically like they're all straight

1614.679 --> 1620.159
lines straight lines

1618.159 --> 1622.6000000000001
yeah latitude lines are technically

1620.159 --> 1625.0800000000002
straight

1622.6 --> 1628.36
lines unless you can prove that they're

1625.08 --> 1630.84
not straight lines yeah and there starts

1628.36 --> 1635.1999999999998
the equator question is it a straight

1630.84 --> 1637.559
line is it a circle yeah nobody seems to

1635.2 --> 1641.0
know in this freaking

1637.559 --> 1644.96
world nobody seems to actually have like

1641.0 --> 1646.2
solid data that's like cartisian Etc on

1644.96 --> 1649.52
that at at

1646.2 --> 1649.52
all so

1654.52 --> 1660.399
there's no

1656.559 --> 1663.96
awareness about like what it is how it's

1660.399 --> 1663.9599999999998
derived and what it means

1664.44 --> 1671.44
and to me

1667.44 --> 1674.0
logically I'm going to gamble with yeah

1671.44 --> 1675.8400000000001
these the equator is definitely a

1674.0 --> 1679.399
straight line and I think all the other

1675.84 --> 1683.48
latitude derived angular based lines are

1679.399 --> 1687.08
also straight lines over the Flat

1683.48 --> 1689.84
Earth up until the most

1687.08 --> 1691.799
northern latitude line which would be

1689.84 --> 1693.8799999999999
where Polaris is directly above you and

1691.799 --> 1696.2
that is also a line and then who knows

1693.88 --> 1698.64
what is beyond there like theoretically

1696.2 --> 1701.3990000000001
you might not even be able to make it

1698.64 --> 1704.96
just assuming that you're able to make

1701.399 --> 1708.12
that maybe you can't make it

1704.96 --> 1711.2
maybe you bump into a barrier before the

1708.12 --> 1713.1589999999999
GP is directly above

1711.2 --> 1717.039
you

1713.159 --> 1720.0390000000002
or maybe every time you try to get there

1717.039 --> 1722.24
you kind of end up weirdly def like it

1720.039 --> 1727.039
warps around you and suddenly Polaris is

1722.24 --> 1728.44
behind you again like you can't reach it

1727.039 --> 1731.48
that way through a

1728.44 --> 1734.559
loop or you can just reach it nobody

1731.48 --> 1736.32
just does it takes notice and Polaris is

1734.559 --> 1738.519
like directly above you in that line

1736.32 --> 1742.399
walking east to west then you go further

1738.519 --> 1744.76
north and suddenly Polaris is behind you

1742.399 --> 1747.12
slightly in the South and like the GP

1744.76 --> 1749.32
system could technically continue on

1747.12 --> 1751.4799999999998
further

1749.32 --> 1754.6399999999999
north where

1751.48 --> 1757.559
Polaris in that realm segment beyond the

1754.64 --> 1760.6000000000001
anti equator would kind of be like the

1757.559 --> 1763.279
Southern Cross of that realm and who

1760.6 --> 1765.32
knows what the other Demi spere of the

1763.279 --> 1768.2
celestial lights is going to be like is

1765.32 --> 1771.32
that going to be the same Demi

1768.2 --> 1774.2
spere in our realm or is it a completely

1771.32 --> 1777.4399999999998
new one that you never get to see unless

1774.2 --> 1781.48
you go beyond the anti equator in the

1777.44 --> 1781.48
north we don't know any of

1782.519 --> 1787.36
that but these are the logical

1787.519 --> 1794.919
possibilities and I'm not letting it go

1790.72 --> 1799.559
until somebody knows until we can find

1794.919 --> 1799.5590000000002
definitive resolve to these these

1802.6 --> 1809.9599999999998
issues and that's what I do and I'm not

1805.6 --> 1811.48
going to let anybody stop me from doing

1809.96 --> 1814.44
that

1811.48 --> 1817.64
especially by any form of peer

1814.44 --> 1817.64
pressure you

1817.76 --> 1822.32
know hello seeking star water good to

1820.159 --> 1822.3200000000002
see

1826.24 --> 1829.24
you

1832.72 --> 1839.76
Black boxa Tracks attitude you mean

1837.519 --> 1844.039
altitude I didn't know

1839.76 --> 1848.279
blackbox track attitude I got attitude

1844.039 --> 1850.679
man oh backbox registered the

1848.279 --> 1853.48
attitude well it will register attitude

1850.679 --> 1859.24
because it also has voice recording so I

1853.48 --> 1859.24
guess blackboxes do record attitude

1864.679 --> 1867.76
wait is

1866.2 --> 1871.8400000000001
it

1867.76 --> 1871.84
okay is actually called

1881.279 --> 1888.24
attitude not out all

1884.48 --> 1891.6390000000001
oh okay so it is that's weird that they

1888.24 --> 1892.48
called that attitude then I was thinking

1891.639 --> 1896.24
of

1892.48 --> 1896.24
a a social

1897.6 --> 1900.6
demeanor

1909.2 --> 1914.279
huh pitch

1911.279 --> 1914.279
jaw

1915.0 --> 1921.32
okay I know like

1918.2 --> 1924.0
roll and Pitch as words of like

1921.32 --> 1925.48
maneuvering didn't know yah never heard

1924.0 --> 1929.24
of

1925.48 --> 1930.96
that an attitude no well it might have

1929.24 --> 1933.639
like slipped by but it's always like a

1930.96 --> 1935.8400000000001
weird word when I hear it then because

1933.639 --> 1937.399
it's like attitude wait

1935.84 --> 1939.9189999999999
what

1937.399 --> 1942.76
H what's my opinion on spherical

1939.919 --> 1944.6390000000001
triangles it's

1942.76 --> 1949.08
nonsense

1944.639 --> 1949.08
triangles aren't bent

1951.639 --> 1955.639
you're getting into weird mathematical

1953.88 --> 1961.0390000000002
distortions there

1955.639 --> 1964.399
dupons like in Geometry angles are

1961.039 --> 1964.399
straight straight

1964.679 --> 1970.679
lines

1966.519 --> 1970.679
so that's my opinion of

1976.039 --> 1979.039
that

1986.32 --> 1992.279
okay yeah you can stop bickering about

1988.559 --> 1992.279
other people in my chat

1997.0 --> 2000.919
thanks hey klar hey

2001.679 --> 2008.96
clear

2003.32 --> 2008.96
don't don't talk about Bev here thanks

2017.88 --> 2023.44
unless you could mention anything that

2020.799 --> 2026.84
has any kind of

2023.44 --> 2029.48
point that comes from him then I'd be

2026.84 --> 2032.48
interested to hear it but I doubt that's

2029.48 --> 2032.48
going to work out for

2035.96 --> 2038.96
you

2039.799 --> 2046.0
right

2041.6 --> 2048.96
but my yeah the subject for the show

2046.0 --> 2052.159
today does remain

2048.96 --> 2055.919
standing magnetic north is a

2052.159 --> 2062.079
point everybody pointing to the magnetic

2055.919 --> 2065.56
north will not be parallel in their

2062.079 --> 2067.44
Direction within the cartisian Grid in

2065.56 --> 2069.48
ukian space

2067.44 --> 2073.2000000000003
there will not be parallel

2069.48 --> 2076.56
but everybody looking in the direction

2073.2 --> 2078.3199999999997
of Polaris wherever they are on earth

2076.56 --> 2081.639
they will all be

2078.32 --> 2084.28
parallel including at the very

2081.639 --> 2087.52
theoretical far end of the north where

2084.28 --> 2087.52
it's supposed to be above

2090.52 --> 2098.92
you and it should always be above you

2095.72 --> 2102.9199999999996
there and at that

2098.92 --> 2106.16
Latitude where do you go further east or

2102.92 --> 2108.6800000000003
west how that even works how long is

2106.16 --> 2110.8799999999997
that walking path like how long is that

2108.68 --> 2114.5989999999997
latitude

2110.88 --> 2114.599
line how wide is that

2119.48 --> 2125.8
Loop what s can see po yeah that's

2124.24 --> 2128.7999999999997
right

2125.8 --> 2128.8
so

2133.4 --> 2137.44
have I been around a politics server

2146.4 --> 2154.04
no latest video no I haven't seen

2150.44 --> 2154.04
that Lo build

2155.8 --> 2158.8
evolution

2163.359 --> 2169.64
that's weird I think I might no longer

2165.88 --> 2169.6400000000003
be subscribed to that guy I'm not

2173.76 --> 2179.3190000000004
sure because I don't know I don't know

2182.96 --> 2188.2
why but I mean I don't really care for

2185.8 --> 2191.2400000000002
that entire narrative form anyway oh

2188.2 --> 2193.2799999999997
it's being hidden by the screw that

2191.24 --> 2195.72
let's just freaking figure out what it

2193.28 --> 2197.92
is why are we assuming oh something's

2195.72 --> 2200.68
being hidden by the controllers when

2197.92 --> 2203.16
they're too freaking [ __ ] to make

2200.68 --> 2205.7599999999998
even basic Common Sense these days it's

2203.16 --> 2208.92
like oh really and they're hiding that

2205.76 --> 2211.5200000000004
thing that they obviously don't have the

2208.92 --> 2214.2000000000003
cognitive capability of even grasping

2211.52 --> 2216.079
what the hell they're talking about then

2214.2 --> 2219.839
they're not hiding anything they're too

2216.079 --> 2219.8390000000004
[ __ ] rarded to hide

2220.599 --> 2225.48
anything they don't know it in order to

2224.16 --> 2228.359
hide

2225.48 --> 2230.76
it they're just working with the systems

2228.359 --> 2234.52
that they've been handed they don't know

2230.76 --> 2238.5600000000004
anything they're dumb and just obsessed

2234.52 --> 2238.56
with mind control and

2245.599 --> 2248.599
censorship

2253.839 --> 2259.2799999999997
somebody navigate South yeah well there

2256.2 --> 2262.3999999999996
might be like a lot of stuff

2259.28 --> 2267.1600000000003
there I mean just even officially the

2262.4 --> 2270.599
Pacific Ocean on the map is

2267.16 --> 2275.0
just insanely

2270.599 --> 2275.0
large like insanely

2275.599 --> 2281.88
large like if they have to like try to

2278.64 --> 2285.2
find something in a Pacific Ocean is

2281.88 --> 2287.2400000000002
just undoable like all the ships in the

2285.2 --> 2290.4399999999996
world could be forming a grid pattern

2287.24 --> 2294.359
and they'd still not find something

2290.44 --> 2294.359
there it's crazy

2295.839 --> 2300.72
large and hey there might be certain

2298.68 --> 2302.68
types of places that are just out of

2300.72 --> 2307.0
range of all

2302.68 --> 2308.7599999999998
the radio or whatever weird pafic little

2307.0 --> 2310.96
islands that are just out of range of

2308.76 --> 2314.0
everything where might be like yeah

2310.96 --> 2317.2400000000002
that's just an island that nobody knows

2314.0 --> 2320.88
about and only goes to in

2317.24 --> 2324.0789999999997
secret that could be there and it would

2320.88 --> 2326.92
probably have been covered for by

2324.079 --> 2328.2400000000002
militaries that have discovered it I'm

2326.92 --> 2331.359
like I wouldn't be surprised if the

2328.24 --> 2333.7599999999998
United States military basically has

2331.359 --> 2336.119
secret knowledge of all all kinds of

2333.76 --> 2339.44
islands there that they're basically

2336.119 --> 2341.4
like Pirates just keeping to

2339.44 --> 2344.079
themselves like that's not an

2341.4 --> 2346.319
unreasonable thing to assume that that's

2344.079 --> 2346.319
going

2352.52 --> 2356.72
on right for whatever purposes secret

2355.599 --> 2360.319
weapon

2356.72 --> 2363.9599999999996
bases secret

2360.319 --> 2363.96
satellites satellite

2365.44 --> 2368.44
Towers

2377.28 --> 2380.28
right

2380.48 --> 2388.839
so yeah Pacific is a huge place and

2385.52 --> 2391.28
there may be hidden stuff there I've

2388.839 --> 2394.16
suggested that like 5 years ago it's

2391.28 --> 2397.2400000000002
like yeah man there could be just this

2394.16 --> 2399.3999999999996
just like oh we're just going that way

2397.24 --> 2402.7999999999997
on a big ship and like eventually it's

2399.4 --> 2405.96
like yeah we had land we have no idea

2402.8 --> 2407.8390000000004
where this is this is like a huge junk

2405.96 --> 2411.2
of land it's like

2407.839 --> 2414.2
wild we don't recognize the way this

2411.2 --> 2414.2
looks

2414.4 --> 2420.44
H we're out of communication reach of

2417.64 --> 2420.44
everything

2420.599 --> 2427.04
H what the satellites why aren't the

2424.119 --> 2429.599
satellites working anymore because

2427.04 --> 2429.599
you're out of

2437.04 --> 2442.4
range navigation Tower was built on

2440.119 --> 2444.599
Gilligan's Island that's hilarious glad

2442.4 --> 2444.599
me

2455.319 --> 2458.319
hello

2458.56 --> 2464.119
you should

2461.0 --> 2467.079
wreck the [ __ ] is wrong with you why the

2464.119 --> 2467.079
hell would I do

2469.8 --> 2477.2000000000003
that what so I could get a bunch of

2474.16 --> 2480.0789999999997
shoulder rubber what hell you call that

2477.2 --> 2485.24
a bunch of compliments from

2480.079 --> 2488.92
absolute like trash degenerate people no

2485.24 --> 2492.4399999999996
thanks why the hell would I even do that

2488.92 --> 2495.76
yeah I'm not now part of the show

2492.44 --> 2495.76
that's that's

2496.72 --> 2503.2
enough yeah them having to do without me

2500.88 --> 2503.2000000000003
that's

2503.88 --> 2509.6800000000003
enough why the hell would I go after

2506.72 --> 2512.0
Nathan and with what to what end it all

2509.68 --> 2515.24
it would do is is like make all of them

2512.0 --> 2517.72
like unbelievably

2515.24 --> 2519.72
angry

2517.72 --> 2523.2
these figures that are already like

2519.72 --> 2528.24
obsessed with me in there like haunting

2523.2 --> 2530.1189999999997
me terrible I hate it it's part of the

2528.24 --> 2532.2
reason why I'm not super eager to get

2530.119 --> 2536.119
back because they are literally just

2532.2 --> 2539.5589999999997
nagging me every time they bump into me

2536.119 --> 2542.6400000000003
yeah you think I'm going to go after

2539.559 --> 2545.1600000000003
Nathan but with what with his bad

2542.64 --> 2547.64
attitude like he gives a

2545.16 --> 2550.04
[ __ ]

2547.64 --> 2553.92
what be another whiny complainy [ __ ] on

2550.04 --> 2556.5589999999997
the internet not liking Nathan's

2553.92 --> 2560.76
format so I could get compliments from

2556.559 --> 2562.599
the other trash [ __ ] out there that

2560.76 --> 2565.28
just can't handle Nathan why did you go

2562.599 --> 2567.7200000000003
[ __ ] yourself [ __ ] why the [ __ ] would

2565.28 --> 2567.7200000000003
I do

2568.96 --> 2577.76
that what is the

2572.2 --> 2580.52
point his Flat Earth argumentation is

2577.76 --> 2583.559
solid what is there to go

2580.52 --> 2585.28
after like I don't need to go after him

2583.559 --> 2587.48
over his attitude that doesn't work

2585.28 --> 2589.88
there's no point to it he knows it he

2587.48 --> 2589.88
doesn't

2598.28 --> 2605.079
care they couldn't hand

2601.0 --> 2609.079
me [ __ ] you Kevlar I'm not going to be

2605.079 --> 2611.2400000000002
your shiny Knight

Destroyer just because there's something

2611.24 --> 2615.3999999999996
out there that inconvenienced you

2616.28 --> 2620.8390000000004
somehow you didn't like the way it

2618.44 --> 2622.76
sounded well too [ __ ] bad there's a

2620.839 --> 2624.599
lot of things in this world that I don't

2622.76 --> 2626.88
like the way they sound they're going to

2624.599 --> 2630.6400000000003
happen anyway

2626.88 --> 2633.4
yeah I'm not going to like throw smash

2630.64 --> 2635.0789999999997
myself against the Rocks because of

2633.4 --> 2638.079
something I didn't

2635.079 --> 2638.079
like

2639.599 --> 2645.6800000000003
I'm not your sacrificial little soldier

2643.76 --> 2647.4
that you could just send out against the

2645.68 --> 2650.3999999999996

2738.68 --> 2743.04
way so he could just show up in my chat

2740.76 --> 2743.0400000000004
if he

2746.92 --> 2750.92
wants we had some more email

2762.8 --> 2767.119
less picky I'll even let him be a bit

2764.88 --> 2770.28
Bal tarded if he wants

2767.119 --> 2773.319
to I could use it to basically pay off

2770.28 --> 2776.92
my debt fulfill my GI and go and then I

2773.319 --> 2778.839
can go back to Nathan and and see how

2776.92 --> 2781.44
long that

2778.839 --> 2784.48
lasts see if that's going to work out

2781.44 --> 2786.48
anymore at all cuzz I'm getting the

2784.48 --> 2788.2400000000002
feeling that now that I've attracted

2786.48 --> 2790.72
I've actually

2788.24 --> 2792.68
like I really I'm getting the feeling

2790.72 --> 2795.5589999999997
more and more like I'm really not very

2792.68 --> 2795.5589999999997
welcome anymore at

2795.88 --> 2800.96

2800.96 --> 2804.96
to come back and like yeah that's that's

2806.92 --> 2811.64
cute I don't really want to be in the

2809.2 --> 2815.1189999999997
slave pen

2811.64 --> 2817.2799999999997
anymore and being reprimanded and told

2815.119 --> 2820.2000000000003
off for

2817.28 --> 2821.3590000000004
displaying my own unique intellectually

2820.2 --> 2825.1189999999997
creative

2821.359 --> 2829.2799999999997
beats that are consistent and are my

2825.119 --> 2831.76
thing I don't want to be in some group

2829.28 --> 2833.96
where I'm being told that everything

2831.76 --> 2837.3590000000004
that I do am am good at and have

2833.96 --> 2841.079
contributed uniquely with that that's

2837.359 --> 2843.04
bad yeah I don't want to be in some

2841.079 --> 2847.7200000000003
[ __ ] Communist Regime that's going to

2843.04 --> 2847.72
try to mind wipe me

2852.52 --> 2858.92
and that's what's kind of like making me

2855.64 --> 2863.52
very okay with just doing my show here

2858.92 --> 2863.52
on my own I'm very okay with

2865.04 --> 2868.96
that I'm doing just

2874.72 --> 2877.72
fine

2878.16 --> 2883.0
yeah that's right blue pill Evolution

2880.68 --> 2886.7599999999998
and if he has absolutely no flexibility

2883.0 --> 2889.72
in it then I have nothing to contribute

2886.76 --> 2892.8390000000004
except being bored and feeling

2889.72 --> 2898.0789999999997
disappointed that I can't contribute my

2892.839 --> 2898.0789999999997
own little twist to things as I always

2900.76 --> 2906.599
do I am not just some convenient cookie

2904.119 --> 2908.88
cutter Diplomat that's very well spoken

2906.599 --> 2910.52
and it's always just going to oh I just

2908.88 --> 2913.319
support oh I'll just clarify a little

2910.52 --> 2914.96
bit more all all the glory for the show

2913.319 --> 2917.7599999999998
no

2914.96 --> 2920.48
no I like to play

2917.76 --> 2922.3590000000004
around I am not your cookie cutter well

2920.48 --> 2925.64
spoken

2922.359 --> 2929.64
Diplomat I'm not going to obey you like

2925.64 --> 2932.64
that not without being paid for

2929.64 --> 2932.64
it

2934.599 --> 2937.599
right

2945.96 --> 2951.28
because if I was paid for it yeah

2948.839 --> 2954.2
absolutely I'd be there and I'd be like

2951.28 --> 2956.52
that perfectly smooth perfectly straight

2954.2 --> 2959.24
lined never deviating

2956.52 --> 2961.4
Diplomat for Nathan saying the perfect

2959.24 --> 2967.52
thing just like 10th man would or

2961.4 --> 2967.52
whatever right I can be that and not for

2969.079 --> 2973.319
free not while I'm building

2973.96 --> 2979.52
Deb and he can't pay it I don't blame

2977.839 --> 2983.0789999999997
him for not being able to I'm just

2979.52 --> 2986.319
saying that is an unreasonable offer

2983.079 --> 2986.319
it's not a durable

2994.52 --> 2997.52
offer

2998.319 --> 3001.52
yeah I know Shan

3013.119 --> 3017.4

experiences I've Ever

3040.96 --> 3048.0
Needed I mean I still like it it's just

3044.72 --> 3050.2799999999997
like I am also very aware of its

3048.0 --> 3053.44
addictive nature and I'm like kind of

3050.28 --> 3053.44
glad that I'm out of

3053.52 --> 3060.64
that but uh hey

3057.0 --> 3063.4

3060.64 --> 3066.16
ladies I mean if hey if they like me

3063.4 --> 3068.559
that's cool man I

3066.16 --> 3070.96
accept but I mean it's kind of pointless

3068.559 --> 3070.96
over the

3073.359 --> 3077.68
internet except for like oh bit of

3075.68 --> 3080.44
flirting whatever

3077.68 --> 3083.319
sure hey if they like me that makes me

3080.44 --> 3084.359
happy that that my ego is very pleased

3083.319 --> 3086.24
with

3084.359 --> 3088.04
that

3086.24 --> 3092.0
but unless they're like in the

3088.04 --> 3092.0
Netherlands it's kind of pointless isn't

3094.559 --> 3099.76
it cuz for me it's like no I don't want

3097.319 --> 3102.319
to hook up and oh I'm so popular with

3099.76 --> 3105.2000000000003
the girls like uh I

3102.319 --> 3108.64
want a woman that would actually be

3105.2 --> 3108.64
crazy enough to have a kid with

3110.559 --> 3118.88
me and then I'd make like with the risk

3115.76 --> 3122.0
that is there and then with that still

3118.88 --> 3124.44
do it and then i' like put everything I

3122.0 --> 3130.68
got on

3124.44 --> 3130.68
that to be stable to be not

3133.16 --> 3138.96
risky so I'm just looking for that kind

3136.64 --> 3142.0
of thing I want a

3138.96 --> 3143.599
baby but I also like need the

3142.0 --> 3146.28
understanding with the woman like yeah

3143.599 --> 3150.1600000000003
this is like a freaking military project

3146.28 --> 3154.2000000000003
basically in the world here right

3150.16 --> 3158.68
now and they have to take that

3154.2 --> 3161.72
serious if they don't it's going to be a

3158.68 --> 3166.16
nightmare that'll never

3161.72 --> 3168.68
end so but hey they like me I like

3166.16 --> 3171.7599999999998
flirting I like cuddling I like all that

3168.68 --> 3177.24
kind of stuff I like cats I like petting

3171.76 --> 3177.2400000000002
cats and I like flirting with ladies

3184.559 --> 3188.76
kids are expensive yeah you need a

3187.2 --> 3191.52
committed woman

3188.76 --> 3195.3190000000004
yeah it it's not just expensive they're

3191.52 --> 3195.319
also the risk the

3195.52 --> 3201.52
psychological

3197.559 --> 3204.52
risk the world is [ __ ] messed up now

3201.52 --> 3208.119
it's messed up to people that have grown

3204.52 --> 3210.72
up in to it and have the faculties

3208.119 --> 3214.4
available for

3210.72 --> 3214.3999999999996
them a little

3214.559 --> 3219.799
kid is completely unprotected against

3217.92 --> 3223.04
any of that now they might be more

3219.799 --> 3225.28
Dynamic on the long run with it but you

3223.04 --> 3229.88
don't

3225.28 --> 3234.1600000000003
know and if you let them loose Devils of

3229.88 --> 3237.839
unheard of evil will try to get in

3234.16 --> 3237.839
them literally and

3238.0 --> 3246.319
metaphysically because of especially

3242.24 --> 3250.319
because we me and my wife would be so

3246.319 --> 3253.599
aware so awake and then they have to get

3250.319 --> 3257.52
after him like they it's it's military

3253.599 --> 3260.3590000000004
level then it really is they will try to

3257.52 --> 3262.28
snatch those kids like every freaking

3260.359 --> 3265.5989999999997
day of the of my

3262.28 --> 3268.92
life basic metaphorically it's not l

3265.599 --> 3271.44
thank God but I mean they would try

3268.92 --> 3275.319
especially if I let my guard down in any

3271.44 --> 3276.559
form if I thought it was okay in any way

3275.319 --> 3278.599
that it was

3276.559 --> 3282.92
safe yeah I don't

3278.599 --> 3282.92
know I'm kind of pressured with

3284.24 --> 3291.9599999999996
it but I there would have to be a plan

3287.72 --> 3297.0789999999997
and maybe even like in a way if I want a

3291.96 --> 3297.079
wife I want a wife with a family

3297.24 --> 3302.2799999999997
it's very important that she has a

3300.04 --> 3305.04
family like the family would be there to

3302.28 --> 3307.079
be able to fall back on for her and

3305.04 --> 3309.2799999999997
maybe to

3307.079 --> 3312.8390000000004
like protect the

3309.28 --> 3317.3590000000004
kid like is there family to which they

3312.839 --> 3317.359
like can be dropped off like in Crazy

3317.4 --> 3321.44
situations or if they like the kid like

3319.88 --> 3327.0
really need

3321.44 --> 3327.0
some time on their own away from

3327.119 --> 3334.559
hassle all like

3330.839 --> 3336.2799999999997
assurances takes a village exactly so I

3334.559 --> 3338.2400000000002
basically if I want a wife there's going

3336.28 --> 3339.28
to have to be a village that comes along

3338.24 --> 3341.3999999999996
with that

3339.28 --> 3344.2000000000003
wife

3341.4 --> 3346.599
metaphorically not literally right but

3344.2 --> 3348.96
that's my point and it's like all the

3346.599 --> 3351.7200000000003
ladies are like oh so cute it's like

3348.96 --> 3354.0
yeah but I mean that's just fluff isn't

3351.72 --> 3356.24
it

3354.0 --> 3357.76
like

3356.24 --> 3359.4399999999996
you wouldn't be able to know what to do

3357.76 --> 3362.119
with a

3359.44 --> 3364.52
kid you probably mess it up you just

3362.119 --> 3366.44
give it to the world and then just oh oh

3364.52 --> 3368.599
they yeah they're crazy like the rest of

3366.44 --> 3371.799
the world

3368.599 --> 3373.6400000000003
now I don't know maybe I'm downplaying

3371.799 --> 3375.96
it with the ladies I'm not sure it's

3373.64 --> 3375.96
just

3377.44 --> 3383.92
that anyway I appreciate hearing that

3379.96 --> 3387.0
I'm popular out there that's I like

3383.92 --> 3389.359
that I mean if I'm going to be popular

3387.0 --> 3391.68
then let it be with the

3389.359 --> 3396.24
ladies right because I already got all

3391.68 --> 3398.0389999999998
these M all day long so that that makes

3396.24 --> 3400.839
it good it's like oh well at least the

3398.039 --> 3403.7200000000003
ladies like me then makes more sense

3400.839 --> 3406.0
because they're like ah how dare you how

3403.72 --> 3408.9199999999996
dare you make it more difficult for me

3406.0 --> 3410.2
to be approachable by a lady cuz you

3408.92 --> 3412.88
make me look

3410.2 --> 3416.8799999999997
bad now you're making you look bad I'm

3412.88 --> 3416.88
just making me look good

3417.319 --> 3421.88
and I'm sure all the trolls would

3419.079 --> 3421.88
disagree with

3424.28 --> 3427.52
that all

3428.52 --> 3438.079
right I would like a way darker version

3433.72 --> 3441.52
what imagine if ocracy isn't a

3438.079 --> 3443.799
well yeah I mean it is Richard G it is

3441.52 --> 3447.119
an idiocracy and it's not

3443.799 --> 3449.64
funny it's just dumb it's

3447.119 --> 3453.2400000000002
araman makes his

3449.64 --> 3455.68
move takes the brain everybody dumb

3453.24 --> 3459.319
everybody shortsighted everybody just

3455.68 --> 3461.3999999999996
trting trusting on the automated systems

3459.319 --> 3463.839
that are out there to take them

3461.4 --> 3467.2400000000002
everywhere like a river they have no

3463.839 --> 3470.839
control aramon pure aramon that's what

3467.24 --> 3473.319
they're it's what is

3470.839 --> 3475.68
growing yeah instead of people taking

3473.319 --> 3478.5589999999997
responsibility doing the tough

3475.68 --> 3483.0789999999997
things they just conjure

3478.559 --> 3487.079
more machines to do everything for

3483.079 --> 3490.44
them so it's like the human Universe of

3487.079 --> 3493.799
Wally and idiocracy that's not funny

3490.44 --> 3495.16
kind of a hybrid between that those

3493.799 --> 3497.52
that's what we're dealing with that's

3495.16 --> 3500.1189999999997
like what is at our doorstep right now

3497.52 --> 3502.68
so it's already right moving in there

3500.119 --> 3506.7200000000003
it's just going to like it hasn't

3502.68 --> 3506.72
completely assimilated everything

3517.119 --> 3522.2000000000003
yeah you can't believe they get that

3519.28 --> 3525.079
many views because of people that are

3522.2 --> 3528.799
like oh yeah he's really popular right I

3525.079 --> 3528.799
mean yeah I don't

3529.92 --> 3536.7200000000003
know maybe they're just more

3533.72 --> 3536.72
approachable

3537.4 --> 3544.52
witd is really approachable you know

3539.72 --> 3548.839
he's like socially very good like he

3544.52 --> 3551.64
is as sociable as a as an actual host

3548.839 --> 3555.0389999999998
like a professional host that's like in

3551.64 --> 3558.839
restaurants and events like he is very

3555.039 --> 3562.2400000000002
good at that so in that sense I do

3558.839 --> 3562.24
believe he gets 500

3562.92 --> 3567.44
views I think wit it is actually pretty

3565.599 --> 3570.28
cool it's just

3567.44 --> 3573.2000000000003
that you can kind of like lose track of

3570.28 --> 3574.76
what's real because of his suspension

3573.2 --> 3578.5989999999997
within his

3574.76 --> 3580.44
ideas and he has typical aberration

3578.599 --> 3583.92
issues where he's like going after

3580.44 --> 3587.2000000000003
something that's unprovable like

3583.92 --> 3589.6800000000003
ether but other than that like wit it is

3587.2 --> 3592.7599999999998
almost like akumu virus

3589.68 --> 3597.839
is to me like a Kuma virus is like a

3592.76 --> 3601.039
pretty cool guy but he's barded well wit

3597.839 --> 3601.96
it is very cool he really is kind of a

3601.039 --> 3606.599
cool

3601.96 --> 3606.599
guy but he has ether tart

3607.039 --> 3611.039
issues that's kind of how I see

3617.319 --> 3624.359
him it's kind of a jerk always saying

3620.799 --> 3625.359
try to keep up yeah but that but that's

3624.359 --> 3628.0789999999997
just

3625.359 --> 3631.4
that's just bragging he says that

3628.079 --> 3634.319
because of his he's always like quickly

3631.4 --> 3637.88
talk like oh try to keep up that's just

3634.319 --> 3637.88
ragging if he says try to keep

3646.599 --> 3650.76
up sh to yeah

3653.52 --> 3660.559
indeed

3656.079 --> 3663.7200000000003
BR Sanchez I don't even I went on that a

3660.559 --> 3663.7200000000003
couple of times he

3678.52 --> 3684.68
weird right I'm going

3681.16 --> 3687.0
to turn on my coffee I think and put

3684.68 --> 3690.0
Illuminati CA on the oven because I

3687.0 --> 3692.599
haven't done that yet getting kind of

3690.0 --> 3694.16
hungry all right so I hope you guys are

3692.599 --> 3697.76
enjoying the

3694.16 --> 3697.7599999999998
show be right

3713.44 --> 3716.44
back

3803.76 --> 3806.7990000000004
right any I am

3827.359 --> 3833.279
back H what the

3831.279 --> 3836.279
hell

3833.279 --> 3836.279
what

3842.599 --> 3845.88
okay that's

3862.599 --> 3869.3590000000004
weird yeah the machine lies guy just

3865.16 --> 3872.799
went live 35 minutes ago that's

3869.359 --> 3875.799
weird that's not usual time for

3872.799 --> 3875.799
him

3892.4 --> 3896.1600000000003
H right so

3896.64 --> 3900.48
yeah what can we talk

3900.92 --> 3904.52
about the amount of

3906.52 --> 3911.48
views the weird thing is I don't get a

3909.039 --> 3914.4
lot of live viewers or if that's the

3911.48 --> 3919.039
case it's not registering but seriously

3914.4 --> 3923.6800000000003
like after the fact I get a tons of

3919.039 --> 3926.8390000000004
views I do I get tons of views a lot of

3923.68 --> 3929.24
people are watching my shows it doesn't

3926.839 --> 3932.279
really seem to reflect like the life

3929.24 --> 3935.7599999999998
amount the amount of Life

3932.279 --> 3935.76
viewers doesn't

3936.0 --> 3940.119
seem right but my show yesterday like

3938.44 --> 3944.92
already got

3940.119 --> 3949.799
286 holy trebuchet show has 663 views by

3944.92 --> 3949.799
now so there's plenty of people

3951.68 --> 3959.279
watching it just doesn't seem to be be

3955.16 --> 3959.279
that many watching live for some

3959.319 --> 3963.319
reason so I don't know what that

3963.559 --> 3968.7200000000003
is my time slotted in the

3967.0 --> 3972.119
US

3968.72 --> 3974.9199999999996
maybe right maybe it's that maybe a lot

3972.119 --> 3978.76
of people are actually watching live or

3974.92 --> 3982.079
something but not commenting

3978.76 --> 3982.079
and I don't

3983.0 --> 3986.52
know

3984.839 --> 3988.0789999999997
a lot of the times like the early bir

3986.52 --> 3990.839
show it does feel like there's just a

3988.079 --> 3993.6400000000003
lot more people actually watching than

3990.839 --> 3996.0789999999997
is being reflected by the

3993.64 --> 3999.0
Numbers just by the sheer amount of

3996.079 --> 4003.319
trolls sometimes that pop up alone the

3999.0 --> 4006.52
viewer should like logically directly go

4003.319 --> 4008.599
up because you can't be a troll unless

4006.52 --> 4011.799
you was were subscribed with that

4008.599 --> 4014.0
account and unless you're literally

4011.799 --> 4015.7599999999998
doing something and just viewing it

4014.0 --> 4019.359
being registered as a viewer and it

4015.76 --> 4022.2400000000002
seems like the viewer counter

4019.359 --> 4023.96
just it doesn't honestly reflect the

4022.24 --> 4026.9199999999996
amount of people that are actually in

4023.96 --> 4028.4
that moment watching a lot of the times

4026.92 --> 4031.359
that's the feeling that I get it's been

4028.4 --> 4031.359
like that for quite a

4036.44 --> 4042.16
while is I thought MC tun going to be

4040.559 --> 4044.6400000000003
here

4042.16 --> 4048.52
what I don't know if he's going to be

4044.64 --> 4050.8799999999997
here he's not blocked

4048.52 --> 4054.24
anymore but I did make it kind of

4050.88 --> 4057.119
abundantly clear like I'm not going to

4054.24 --> 4061.319
bicker you with you about Nathan Oakley

4057.119 --> 4061.319
or about Flat Earth

4061.44 --> 4067.48
arguments because you're just going to

4064.119 --> 4071.319
try to manipulate it and trying to make

4067.48 --> 4074.64
me look stupid make flut look stupid and

4071.319 --> 4076.96
I don't want to be part of that at all

4074.64 --> 4078.4
so hey if he wants to come by and say

4076.96 --> 4080.96
hello or

4078.4 --> 4083.64
whatever maybe even like call me on

4080.96 --> 4085.2
Skype or something that's fine and maybe

4083.64 --> 4087.68
I'll have him

4085.2 --> 4090.68
on

4087.68 --> 4092.96
right but I'm not going to do some

4090.68 --> 4096.559
bicker

4092.96 --> 4096.559
debate I'm done with

4097.04 --> 4101.799
that you want a bigger debate you go to

4099.56 --> 4105.839000000001
Nathan

4101.799 --> 4105.839
Oakley door is always open for

4108.64 --> 4115.4800000000005
that wrap up the show no I'm not going

4112.08 --> 4115.48
to wrap up the show bloop

4118.839 --> 4123.679
though but hey if he's going to wrap up

4121.48 --> 4125.799
the show then like if he's going to show

4123.679 --> 4127.319
up in the last second well then he's

4125.799 --> 4130.319
just a freaking

4127.319 --> 4135.799

PayPal

4913.92 --> 4917.4
medicinal mass

4919.0 --> 4922.09
[Music]

4922.239 --> 4929.239
media that's

4924.679 --> 4932.4
a kind of paradoxical name but I

4929.239 --> 4932.4
understand the thought behind

4934.639 --> 4940.4800000000005
it cuz yeah I'm sorry mass media is

4938.28 --> 4943.92
really anything but

4940.48 --> 4948.36
medicinal it's a mass mive psychological

4943.92 --> 4952.2390000000005
spiritual problem for the entire

4948.36 --> 4954.679
world the percentage of like aggressive

4952.239 --> 4958.919999999999
psychological indoctrination and mind

4954.679 --> 4961.8
control has like gone to alltime high

4958.92 --> 4965.32
records and that's worldwide in

4961.8 --> 4967.400000000001
everything like everything got infected

4965.32 --> 4969.92
with it with that mindset with that way

4967.4 --> 4969.92
of doing

4971.56 --> 4978.159000000001
things and it cannot be remedied by

4975.159 --> 4982.5199999999995
another

4978.159 --> 4985.239
media it it can't it's only people

4982.52 --> 4989.639
deciding to not partake anymore that's

4985.239 --> 4989.638999999999
going to fix that and people

4991.639 --> 4999.32
won't not until they provably like lost

4995.96 --> 5000.92
everything over it then they'll stop

4999.32 --> 5003.599999999999
because that's how people are people

5000.92 --> 5005.8
don't learn their lessons until they

5003.6 --> 5009.400000000001
made a massive sacrifice to their

5005.8 --> 5012.679
foolishness and then they figure it out

5009.4 --> 5012.679
cuz that's just how people

5017.76 --> 5022.92
are

5019.679 --> 5026.28
stupid they want to make the mistake

5022.92 --> 5026.28
they want to pay the

5030.96 --> 5036.159
price or the demon in them does anyway

5034.0 --> 5040.36
and they don't know how to see the

5036.159 --> 5040.36
difference cuz their parents don't teach

5041.36 --> 5050.08
them thisal mass is a 420 smoke oh

5045.6 --> 5053.96
[ __ ] oh so it's a dopy s

5050.08 --> 5053.96
man the ganja

5061.36 --> 5064.36
silver

5077.08 --> 5081.96
oh you watched that movie in air I

5078.719 --> 5083.92
didn't get to watch it slow-mo I it's I

5081.96 --> 5087.36
have it downloaded though I didn't get

5083.92 --> 5090.52
to watching it it was too late at

5087.36 --> 5094.08
night but it looked really really

5090.52 --> 5095.679
interesting man really interesting like

5094.08 --> 5099.04
serious good

5095.679 --> 5100.719
acting I'm very happy that uh Owen

5099.04 --> 5103.639
Benjamin recommended that movie

5100.719 --> 5107.88
yesterday on his show with some video

5103.639 --> 5110.679
clips of it because like that looks epic

5107.88 --> 5114.8
epic I I download I'm definitely going

5110.679 --> 5117.28
to enjoy watching it because it had some

5114.8 --> 5119.4400000000005
serious

5117.28 --> 5122.679
fractal

5119.44 --> 5124.96
implicated things in there just it's

5122.679 --> 5128.4400000000005
massive it's

5124.96 --> 5128.44
like it's like

5129.52 --> 5135.639
metaphysical it's metaphysically on

5132.6 --> 5137.8
point for this time

5135.639 --> 5141.76
period like

5137.8 --> 5144.4800000000005
it's it's spiritually up to dat with the

5141.76 --> 5146.360000000001
situation you could say I think that's

5144.48 --> 5149.36
probably a good

5146.36 --> 5151.639
description it's really it's aware it's

5149.36 --> 5155.44
aware of what's real what's going on and

5151.639 --> 5156.679
it's very very fasc like you'll get a

5155.44 --> 5158.96
you're anything like me you're going to

5156.679 --> 5163.8
get a kick out of that out of watching

5158.96 --> 5167.44
that also from the devil's perspective

5163.8 --> 5170.719
guy too cuz in a way I have

5167.44 --> 5172.4
that but I just haven't surrendered

5170.719 --> 5174.84
everything to

5172.4 --> 5178.08
it yeah that's the difference and they

5174.84 --> 5181.159000000001
never will no I put it in that cage it's

5178.08 --> 5183.48
a golden cage it's a golden cage that

5181.159 --> 5184.92
cannot be stripped from it gold because

5183.48 --> 5188.119
the gold is

5184.92 --> 5191.84
information it's going to be Eternal I

5188.119 --> 5191.839999999999
can keep him in there forever

5194.52 --> 5201.280000000001
philosophically and so I find it very

5197.84 --> 5204.28
fascinating this acting of a possessed

5201.28 --> 5208.599999999999
person of how

5204.28 --> 5211.239
they go into the collective real Road

5208.6 --> 5213.76
like the way of thinking you become that

5211.239 --> 5216.159
devil you become possessed the devil has

5213.76 --> 5217.4400000000005
that information and has that

5216.159 --> 5219.599999999999
information through others so while

5217.44 --> 5222.32
you're possessed by the devil that form

5219.6 --> 5224.4400000000005
of Consciousness also realizes like this

5222.32 --> 5228.239
is not the only body I'm

5224.44 --> 5231.799999999999
in like I can achieve this thing with my

5228.239 --> 5234.5199999999995
ego will of that devil even through

5231.8 --> 5237.719
other people that have the same so it's

5234.52 --> 5239.320000000001
like a devil spirit is like a

5237.719 --> 5243.44
collective

5239.32 --> 5246.88
unique frequency thing

5243.44 --> 5250.96
and you just take it on and you can

5246.88 --> 5250.96
mistake yourself as being

5251.84 --> 5257.04
it but it's not really it's not your

5254.679 --> 5260.32
natural

5257.04 --> 5263.719
function it's like an emergency

5260.32 --> 5267.84
Stockholm surrender mode that comes with

5263.719 --> 5271.2390000000005
a full package programming it's it's

5267.84 --> 5274.32
like the idea of MK Ultra except there's

5271.239 --> 5278.159
no torture and blah blah no it's just it

5274.32 --> 5281.679
just automatically happens like the form

5278.159 --> 5285.44
of how you respond like a stock hob

5281.679 --> 5287.92
syndrome it leaves nothing to the

5285.44 --> 5291.96
imagination or random

5287.92 --> 5295.4800000000005
chance how you respond is like pre

5291.96 --> 5298.08
packaged for you when you arrive to that

5295.48 --> 5302.959999999999
spiritual state for you to latch on and

5298.08 --> 5307.159
film fill a perfect role like

5302.96 --> 5310.159
devil it's it's there it's just there

5307.159 --> 5313.759999999999
it's there in in the spirit

5310.159 --> 5318.159
realm if you do that you will literally

5313.76 --> 5320.400000000001
like just fulfill a role that's just

5318.159 --> 5323.5599999999995
programmed

5320.4 --> 5326.759999999999
there you go with the autopilot you take

5323.56 --> 5326.76
on the job of a

5326.88 --> 5335.36
devil it's all there but it's [ __ ] up

5331.04 --> 5339.08
and you will only lose more grip o of

5335.36 --> 5343.159
your real self as you do

5339.08 --> 5345.8
that cu the devil as you enjoy the

5343.159 --> 5348.48
autopilot or rather you just like it's

5345.8 --> 5350.4800000000005
easy you just do that you don't matter

5348.48 --> 5352.919999999999
anymore you just follow the patterns as

5350.48 --> 5356.04
they're laid out in that state of

5352.92 --> 5358.4800000000005
mind but guess what the devil always

5356.04 --> 5361.48
ends up sacrificing

5358.48 --> 5363.5199999999995
you cuz the part of the reason why they

5361.48 --> 5366.159
have that that other form of

5363.52 --> 5370.8
Consciousness has the Reigns is under

5366.159 --> 5370.799999999999
condition that the original you

5371.0 --> 5379.08
state is okay with being

5376.239 --> 5381.959999999999
destroyed that's a core

5379.08 --> 5385.6
component that other state can't take

5381.96 --> 5389.04
you and do its things if the real you

5385.6 --> 5393.88
that might be on the backside not

5389.04 --> 5397.0
conscious if it in spirit doesn't agree

5393.88 --> 5399.4400000000005
that it's okay to be sacrificed for

5397.0 --> 5401.0
whatever that other state of mind might

5399.44 --> 5402.638999999999
think

5401.0 --> 5406.52
of

5402.639 --> 5410.4400000000005
yeah a true surrender to the devil or to

5406.52 --> 5415.320000000001
being possessed is like a conscious

5410.44 --> 5419.239
inner will that says take me

5415.32 --> 5422.799999999999
then you allow yourself to be like a

5419.239 --> 5423.959999999999
slave which can also yeah you could also

5422.8 --> 5426.8
be

5423.96 --> 5428.76
killed in that sense you're okay with

5426.8 --> 5430.56
that sometimes you might even long for

5428.76 --> 5434.360000000001
it it's like oh well maybe the devil

5430.56 --> 5439.0
that will possess me will finally end me

5434.36 --> 5440.92
right permission that's right it's it's

5439.0 --> 5441.84
key it doesn't even have to be spoken

5440.92 --> 5445.32
it's

5441.84 --> 5448.6
just what the will

5445.32 --> 5451.159
does and if you're like [ __ ] my life I

5448.6 --> 5453.400000000001
don't matter like I'll just be part of

5451.159 --> 5456.799999999999
something bigger and if it sacrifice me

5453.4 --> 5461.5199999999995
like a piece of trash I'm okay with it

5456.8 --> 5464.1990000000005
yeah and then you get a solid

5461.52 --> 5465.92
manifestation of the devil form because

5464.199 --> 5469.28
you have the right conditions you gave

5465.92 --> 5472.28
the right permissions now it can move in

5469.28 --> 5474.639
and do its thing because the conditions

5472.28 --> 5474.639
are

5477.44 --> 5483.599999999999
right but only for as long as you have

5481.199 --> 5485.5599999999995
your will set in that

5483.6 --> 5489.360000000001
way and

5485.56 --> 5492.119000000001
if it just like you change your mind

5489.36 --> 5495.08
it's like wait now there's actually

5492.119 --> 5496.96
something to live for now then the

5495.08 --> 5498.08
devil's like hey hey hey hey what are

5496.96 --> 5502.159
you

5498.08 --> 5505.92
doing and they're gone because now that

5502.159 --> 5508.679
key component is missing and then I

5505.92 --> 5508.679
can't do that

5510.76 --> 5513.76
anymore

5520.88 --> 5527.92
yeah it's not just vacancy not just

5524.8 --> 5529.52
room in your mind that they need they

5527.92 --> 5533.4800000000005
also need the

5529.52 --> 5535.84
grip but the grip is only there when you

5533.48 --> 5539.799999999999
let your shield down the shield

5535.84 --> 5542.2390000000005
smoothens it out makes it UNG grippable

5539.8 --> 5546.639
you let the shield down it's like

5542.239 --> 5549.239
take me I am my spirit is subservient to

5546.639 --> 5549.2390000000005
this other

5549.32 --> 5556.119
thing and then it can take in the place

5553.28 --> 5558.36
and have grip and then take the levers

5556.119 --> 5561.119
it's only for as long as you give it

5558.36 --> 5563.4
that by letting your inner shield down

5561.119 --> 5563.4
to

5566.6 --> 5572.400000000001
it as soon as you like find your inner

5570.28 --> 5574.84
will and like know

5572.4 --> 5577.44
no what's going to happen is not

5574.84 --> 5577.4400000000005
acceptable

5577.639 --> 5584.1990000000005
anymore I want certain things I want to

5580.56 --> 5587.84
be whole I I see a hope of becoming

5584.199 --> 5592.159
whole again and have a

5587.84 --> 5592.159000000001
meaningful remainder of my life

5592.84 --> 5598.4800000000005
then demon Can't Get Grip anymore it'll

5595.96 --> 5601.639
it will evacuate but it will try to

5598.48 --> 5603.5599999999995
torture you and and like remind you of

5601.639 --> 5606.2390000000005
all the damage that is caused by your

5603.56 --> 5608.8
negligence to try to take it all away

5606.239 --> 5614.0
again right try

5608.8 --> 5617.56
to make you stop filling the void make

5614.0 --> 5620.199
you stop finding a purpose that's

5617.56 --> 5623.280000000001
durable so it's very hard to really get

5620.199 --> 5626.48
them out once they've taken

5623.28 --> 5629.44
you but it is

5626.48 --> 5633.5599999999995
doable you just have to really find that

5629.44 --> 5633.5599999999995
will it's just like

5635.56 --> 5640.2390000000005
somebody that would for example for

5637.88 --> 5642.4800000000005
whatever reason have Suicidal Tendencies

5640.239 --> 5646.44
and it's like yeah you really have to

5642.48 --> 5648.36
decide are you going to give into it or

5646.44 --> 5651.0
are you going to fight

5648.36 --> 5653.719
it you must

5651.0 --> 5657.239
decide and nobody can tell

5653.719 --> 5659.92
you but we can tell you remind you that

5657.239 --> 5663.4
you must decide that you must be the

5659.92 --> 5664.92
first response to whatever comes to you

5663.4 --> 5667.08
that tries to pushes you in that

5664.92 --> 5669.0
direction you must

5667.08 --> 5672.28
decide whether

5669.0 --> 5675.4
you want to give in the to the suicide

5672.28 --> 5677.719
at some point for whatever conceivable

5675.4 --> 5680.44
reason for whatever conceivable

5677.719 --> 5682.719
condition you might be at or whether you

5680.44 --> 5685.4
will no matter the condition no matter

5682.719 --> 5688.52
what you feel will always fight it off

5685.4 --> 5690.92
will always like an inner devil that's

5688.52 --> 5694.400000000001
always trying to get you fight it off

5690.92 --> 5696.4
forever and never admit to an inch of it

5694.4 --> 5700.719
a a word a

5696.4 --> 5700.719
suggestion a Nuance nothing about

5700.8 --> 5707.8
it you have to decide that for yourself

5703.6 --> 5710.639
on the inside and saying what you do or

5707.8 --> 5713.159000000001
how you want it to be has no

5710.639 --> 5717.4800000000005
influence words do not have to be spoken

5713.159 --> 5717.48
it has to be willed and

5717.96 --> 5722.639
decided saying things don't make

5720.6 --> 5726.2390000000005
anything happen

5722.639 --> 5726.2390000000005
it has to be decided on the

5735.36 --> 5741.599999999999
Inside Yes Richard G most of us have I

5738.52 --> 5746.360000000001
mean that's how a lot of this Society

5741.6 --> 5746.360000000001
Works you're trained in school for

5747.84 --> 5753.2390000000005
it they build the

5750.4 --> 5756.159
levers for the internal entity by

5753.239 --> 5758.199
standardizing a certain knowledge so

5756.159 --> 5759.719
wherever the entity might arrive they

5758.199 --> 5764.36
will always be

5759.719 --> 5766.679
familiar because it's a uniform type of

5764.36 --> 5769.199
teaching and then they discourage

5766.679 --> 5774.4
critical thinking

5769.199 --> 5774.4
discourage going against Authority

5775.679 --> 5780.04
intellectually and so you then have the

5777.8 --> 5782.639
vacuum you have the standardized tools

5780.04 --> 5784.84
that are available to you and thus also

5782.639 --> 5787.719
anything that possesses you and a

5784.84 --> 5789.52
vacancy because you're not really made

5787.719 --> 5792.88
strong and

5789.52 --> 5795.679
fulfilling all conditions to become

5792.88 --> 5800.0
possessed it's normal it's like inte

5795.679 --> 5802.88
it's covertly occultly integrated in

5800.0 --> 5806.04
standard Society Western society which

5802.88 --> 5810.119
is not surprising since it's

5806.04 --> 5812.76
cosmology is reversed World Satanism

5810.119 --> 5814.799999999999
technically is it's just too surreal to

5812.76 --> 5818.639
really understand that properly for most

5814.8 --> 5820.0
of it for most of them yeah but it makes

5818.639 --> 5822.96
perfect sense

5820.0 --> 5825.92
that the system the Beast system that is

5822.96 --> 5828.28
the Western education system and

5825.92 --> 5829.88
official government positions on

5828.28 --> 5832.599999999999
information and

5829.88 --> 5838.08
everything it's not surprising that they

5832.6 --> 5840.1990000000005
literally just train people to

5838.08 --> 5843.199
become

5840.199 --> 5846.5599999999995
vacant

5843.199 --> 5848.44
operating tools for demons that they

5846.56 --> 5851.400000000001
specifically programing people in the

5848.44 --> 5856.119
way that makes that very

5851.4 --> 5860.638999999999
efficient for the demons to do that

5856.119 --> 5863.5599999999995
because it like the Western Society in

5860.639 --> 5866.1990000000005
that sense is actually covertly

5863.56 --> 5869.719
demonic it reverses everything it

5866.199 --> 5872.719
reverses the entire reality in so many

5869.719 --> 5875.84
ways I mean we must be able to see it by

5872.719 --> 5877.76
now that it is really overtly demonic

5875.84 --> 5881.2390000000005
people that surrender to

5877.76 --> 5884.599
this ever worsening ever increasing

5881.239 --> 5888.4
delusion of what's modern

5884.599 --> 5890.1990000000005
reality they are becoming more and more

5888.4 --> 5893.96
blatantly

5890.199 --> 5895.759999999999
demonic everybody can see

5893.96 --> 5898.679
it

5895.76 --> 5901.76
so the

5898.679 --> 5905.679
mechanisms that have built this

5901.76 --> 5909.52
Society are now just showing themselves

5905.679 --> 5914.679
to be tools for

5909.52 --> 5914.679
demons to get in our

5915.119 --> 5918.119
business

5925.92 --> 5928.92
literally

5929.679 --> 5936.2390000000005
okay right so yeah to go B back to you I

5933.44 --> 5939.08
said yeah being possessed actually I was

5936.239 --> 5941.879999999999
in ways possessed I've been possessed by

5939.08 --> 5946.4
certain ideas that are

5941.88 --> 5950.400000000001
like like induce physical pain when I

5946.4 --> 5953.28
think back to that I actually stood

5950.4 --> 5955.4
behind that idea in my ignorance like it

5953.28 --> 5958.8
it hurts me

5955.4 --> 5962.638999999999
physical to the degree that I really try

5958.8 --> 5965.56
to not put people's mind towards that

5962.639 --> 5965.56
being conscious of

5966.679 --> 5971.56
it I have talked about everything but

5969.639 --> 5974.84
I've always then talked about it in a

5971.56 --> 5979.320000000001
way that people don't pick up on how

5974.84 --> 5979.32
unbelievably painful it actually is to

5980.4 --> 5986.96
me but yeah I've had ideas in the past

5983.239 --> 5990.5199999999995
that are like really like make me hate

5986.96 --> 5993.04
myself so bad for that I fell for that

5990.52 --> 5993.040000000001
trick

6000.44 --> 6006.4
but yeah that's the society you get

6003.08 --> 6008.159
encouraged from all sides to embrace

6006.4 --> 6010.759999999999
demonic

6008.159 --> 6012.5199999999995
behavior and other people say like yeah

6010.76 --> 6015.119000000001
this is the way to go now you're one of

6012.52 --> 6017.119000000001
us if you do this yeah well then no [ __ ]

6015.119 --> 6019.759999999999
that everybody like is like oh well I

6017.119 --> 6021.799999999999
want to be a part of something I I don't

6019.76 --> 6025.1990000000005
want to be left behind

6021.8 --> 6025.1990000000005
and then everybody becomes

6030.8 --> 6037.320000000001
demonic you live rent free in that's

6034.719 --> 6039.679
hilarious possessing a

6037.32 --> 6043.199
devil yeah but the problem is Devils

6039.679 --> 6047.36
don't really have bodies to

6043.199 --> 6049.44
possess they are exclusively possessors

6047.36 --> 6052.96
but what you can do

6049.44 --> 6056.239
is emulate a

6052.96 --> 6059.4800000000005
devil it's like you

6056.239 --> 6062.04
can imprison the thing that would

6059.48 --> 6064.199
normally possess you it's like

6062.04 --> 6067.0
controlled possession and it's something

6064.199 --> 6072.48
that normal people should never

6067.0 --> 6074.52
do only mentally hyper flexible people

6072.48 --> 6077.199
in a very specific way like I am like I

6074.52 --> 6079.1990000000005
can do Ballwin when I do Ballwin I

6077.199 --> 6082.04
actually believe it it's real and you

6079.199 --> 6086.96
can feel that and you can feel how weird

6082.04 --> 6090.639
that is that it's real yeah that sort of

6086.96 --> 6095.4
thing enables me to basically emulate

6090.639 --> 6095.400000000001
devils and not let them take me

6096.04 --> 6101.36
over not let them fully consume me they

6099.84 --> 6103.159000000001
don't take things away from me because

6101.36 --> 6105.5199999999995
they're stuck in that cage they can just

6103.159 --> 6108.759999999999
like maneuver a bit show

6105.52 --> 6110.1990000000005
themselves threaten the world from their

6108.76 --> 6114.320000000001
vantage point which is part of what

6110.199 --> 6116.119
Devils do too it's like yeah what you

6114.32 --> 6117.88
think you can stop us you think you

6116.119 --> 6120.199
overcome the

6117.88 --> 6121.88
Devils here's one right now I'm going to

6120.199 --> 6123.719
tell you exactly what they're going to

6121.88 --> 6127.679
be

6123.719 --> 6130.92
doing so that you don't have that false

6127.679 --> 6134.88
sense of security and arrogance about

6130.92 --> 6134.88
how you're on top of the

6139.52 --> 6146.400000000001
world I mean

6142.639 --> 6147.4400000000005
at right but if you let devil frequency

6146.4 --> 6153.36
inside of

6147.44 --> 6156.678999999999
you it's dangerous because it will be

6153.36 --> 6159.08
seduced to try to damage you from the

6156.679 --> 6163.52
inside out of

6159.08 --> 6167.96
arrogance you got to be well

6163.52 --> 6167.96
prepared to do anything like what I

6168.92 --> 6173.92
do you basically have have to be like a

6171.56 --> 6176.280000000001
spiritual shape changer to be able to do

6173.92 --> 6179.4
such things if you're not like that

6176.28 --> 6183.28
naturally then never do

6179.4 --> 6183.28
it it will just

6183.4 --> 6189.36
suck it might keep you stuck in a

6187.04 --> 6190.88
certain State of Mind by accident and

6189.36 --> 6193.04
you can't get out of it and you might

6190.88 --> 6195.52
have serious mental consequences so

6193.04 --> 6199.32
unless you are naturally a spiritual

6195.52 --> 6202.679
shape changer don't even try

6199.32 --> 6202.679
it no

6221.8 --> 6228.119000000001
right but I mean to me all of this is

6224.52 --> 6232.56
like part of my study in the dark

6228.119 --> 6234.96
world I had seen conversed with Devils

6232.56 --> 6238.719
went on challenges with devils and when

6234.96 --> 6242.52
I say Devils I mean completely red

6238.719 --> 6243.96
skinned big horned humanoid figures with

6242.52 --> 6248.2390000000005
goat

6243.96 --> 6250.639
legs in a giant Rocky desert with red

6248.239 --> 6250.638999999999
light

6251.239 --> 6258.36
everywhere and relatively dark no

6255.08 --> 6260.84
sun that's like a thing that I saw in

6258.36 --> 6264.639
multiple occasions it's like a frequency

6260.84 --> 6268.08
I could phase into and the Devils there

6264.639 --> 6269.96
they were like figures there they would

6268.08 --> 6272.4
try to tricked me by basically

6269.96 --> 6275.36
interfacing with the back of my mind

6272.4 --> 6279.119
which also was like a control set

6275.36 --> 6281.119
for the Hol deck effect where literally

6279.119 --> 6283.639
like they could do

6281.119 --> 6287.239
things like almost like point at the

6283.639 --> 6290.119
back of my head and then like suddenly a

6287.239 --> 6291.159
a hologram I would be like in a Hol deck

6290.119 --> 6296.08
in

6291.159 --> 6299.0
a governmental office with a man in a

6296.08 --> 6302.639
suit there sitting there and talking to

6299.0 --> 6305.8
me and that would be the devil's

6302.639 --> 6308.32
emulation they do that by basically that

6305.8 --> 6310.320000000001
mechanism and but I figured it out in

6308.32 --> 6314.159
the process and then turn it off and

6310.32 --> 6317.08
it's like in the middle of the of that

6314.159 --> 6319.0
emulation of he was trying to accuse me

6317.08 --> 6321.5599999999995
like you're a terrorist you've done this

6319.0 --> 6323.48
that you're going to be executed but if

6321.56 --> 6325.599
we can make a deal you just have to do

6323.48 --> 6329.119
everything we

6325.599 --> 6331.2390000000005
say and then you'll be let off the hook

6329.119 --> 6334.119
but you can never waver even once that's

6331.239 --> 6337.5199999999995
literally what they tried on me and

6334.119 --> 6339.44
like also mental suppressing things so

6337.52 --> 6343.400000000001
it's very risky that's a thing that I

6339.44 --> 6346.5599999999995
could have fallen for but then as it

6343.4 --> 6349.36
engaged I realized what it was and then

6346.56 --> 6352.320000000001
I like as I was staring the guy in the

6349.36 --> 6357.88
face in that imulation in that office

6352.32 --> 6359.04
room I would literally dispel the effect

6357.88 --> 6361.719
and

6359.04 --> 6363.92
then it would like turn off and I'd see

6361.719 --> 6366.08
like oh no that man that I thought was

6363.92 --> 6368.8
is actually a devil staring me in the

6366.08 --> 6371.36
face and trying to indoctrinate me and I

6368.8 --> 6373.28
saw like whoa it's this is like a rocky

6371.36 --> 6375.92
desert around me with red light

6373.28 --> 6378.36
everywhere the devil tried a a devil

6375.92 --> 6381.159
there were multiple of them tried to do

6378.36 --> 6382.96
that with me and then I broke out of it

6381.159 --> 6385.96
I figured it out and now the devil's

6382.96 --> 6388.84
like staring at me like being he's this

6385.96 --> 6393.159
is the weirdest part he's not like he

6388.84 --> 6395.04
broke forever he was like a

6393.159 --> 6400.08
disappointed like the devil was just

6395.04 --> 6403.159
standing there like a crap like

6400.08 --> 6405.4
really like really disappoint it's weird

6403.159 --> 6405.4
as

6405.679 --> 6411.04
[ __ ] but that's one of the like more

6408.84 --> 6414.599
distinct Dark World experience that I

6411.04 --> 6417.119
did have like with those devils like

6414.599 --> 6421.96
those devils in the in the metaphysical

6417.119 --> 6427.5199999999995
world in the dark world are like real

6421.96 --> 6427.52
entities non physical

6428.4 --> 6435.96
entities they are like a uniform

6431.679 --> 6438.8
manifest that rides us if we have the

6435.96 --> 6442.28
room for them to do

6438.8 --> 6444.04
that and they're always there in on the

6442.28 --> 6446.5199999999995
other side in the spiritual realm like

6444.04 --> 6448.4
many other things too they're like a

6446.52 --> 6451.4400000000005
real spiritual

6448.4 --> 6453.44
entity and they're not as glorious as

6451.44 --> 6456.719
they are being made out to be in

6453.44 --> 6456.719
folklore in any

6457.92 --> 6465.92
direction I mean I'll never forget the

6460.719 --> 6468.199
look of like a devil figure that looks

6465.92 --> 6470.679
really disillusioned and disappointed

6468.199 --> 6473.678999999999
like that's a site that's just

6470.679 --> 6473.679
undescribable

6474.239 --> 6479.959999999999
guys like you can't describe that I

6477.44 --> 6483.32
can't describe it I could just say it

6479.96 --> 6487.32
just you can't understand what that's

6483.32 --> 6491.799999999999
like it is absolutely surreal and like

6487.32 --> 6491.799999999999
it makes you like rethink everything you

6492.599 --> 6496.56
know and thought to

6497.56 --> 6503.639
understand out of body exper yeah

6499.76 --> 6503.639
roughly doons that is

6505.239 --> 6509.919999999999
it I'm gonna take a bite out of this now

6520.96 --> 6526.119
cheers you know somebody that might have

6523.199 --> 6526.119
died because of that

6529.199 --> 6533.598999999999
yeah

6531.48 --> 6536.28
that's not strange at all

6533.599 --> 6538.52
duper it is very dangerous but with my

6536.28 --> 6542.08
out of body experiences I'm

6538.52 --> 6544.599
not I didn't like not spir Spirit

6542.08 --> 6546.92
traveling in the physical

6544.599 --> 6550.599
world I might have done that like once

6546.92 --> 6553.4
or twice as part of a bigger

6550.599 --> 6556.52
process but I've never like consciously

6553.4 --> 6558.719
individually trained to do that my Dark

6556.52 --> 6562.320000000001
World experience is an outof Body

6558.719 --> 6564.96
Experience that's not like a hovering

6562.32 --> 6568.4
spirit in the physical world it's on the

6564.96 --> 6572.52
other side in the non-physical World

6568.4 --> 6576.92
which it is there it's a separate place

6572.52 --> 6579.679
it's a place where space has no

6576.92 --> 6584.4800000000005
consequence like volume has no

6579.679 --> 6584.4800000000005
consequence and where time has less

6585.08 --> 6593.32
consequence it's not completely gone

6588.599 --> 6595.1990000000005
it's just it's doesn't work linear there

6593.32 --> 6597.599
it's really weird I don't even know what

6595.199 --> 6600.759999999999
the hell is possible with

6597.599 --> 6602.28
it I just know that you in my experience

6600.76 --> 6603.4400000000005
there you could literally see things

6602.28 --> 6607.36
from the

6603.44 --> 6610.48
future and I have many many

6607.36 --> 6614.36
times but I've only ever been able to

6610.48 --> 6616.44
like communicate it in a stable

6614.36 --> 6619.5599999999995
fashion after it's

6616.44 --> 6621.28
happened the Cassandra complex has been

6619.56 --> 6624.56
like all most

6621.28 --> 6626.759999999999
absolute not totally absolute there's

6624.56 --> 6629.599
bigger things that I just saw coming

6626.76 --> 6631.56
like Russia's going to win this war no

6629.599 --> 6632.96
matter how big it gets no matter if

6631.56 --> 6634.360000000001
everything in the world's destroyed

6632.96 --> 6636.44
they're going to win this war like

6634.36 --> 6640.719
there's absolutely nothing that can

6636.44 --> 6644.0
change that absolutely nothing nothing a

6640.719 --> 6647.56
man or anything else could conceive of

6644.0 --> 6650.36
that can change that outcome that's one

6647.56 --> 6652.400000000001
of the things that I know also so

6650.36 --> 6654.5199999999995
through the vision where I have

6652.4 --> 6657.159
absolutely no uncertainty about it and

6654.52 --> 6660.119000000001
that absolutely saying it has no

6657.159 --> 6664.159
consequence whatsoever other than that

6660.119 --> 6664.159
people know that I called

6664.52 --> 6670.119000000001
it and there's a lot of people out there

6667.36 --> 6673.239
right now by now that are really

6670.119 --> 6677.04
figuring out like this is absolute

6673.239 --> 6681.4
crap this war on Russia NATO NATO is

6677.04 --> 6685.599
just trying to destroy the West NATO is

6681.4 --> 6690.04
trying to destroy the West deplete them

6685.599 --> 6690.04
kill everybody off fear

6691.199 --> 6699.28
Monger it destroying the West for no

6695.079 --> 6702.5199999999995
logical reason it's

6699.28 --> 6705.04
pure demonic destruction that they're

6702.52 --> 6705.040000000001
trying to

6705.32 --> 6711.96
cause I saw by the way an interesting

6707.56 --> 6711.96
movie yesterday what was it called again

6717.56 --> 6721.56
the hell was it

6719.28 --> 6723.4
called but it was basically about

6721.56 --> 6728.159000000001
something

6723.4 --> 6732.04
similar was very interesting hold

6728.159 --> 6732.04
on yeah was with Pierce

6735.76 --> 6740.719
brosen I remember that

6738.36 --> 6743.119
name but I don't remember the name of

6740.719 --> 6746.56
the movie oh damn it anyway I got to

6743.119 --> 6746.5599999999995
take a two-minute break I'll be right

6768.84 --> 6771.84
back

6858.719 --> 6863.199
what was that

6860.32 --> 6865.48
lasted movie that I watched

6863.199 --> 6868.48
yesterday was really interesting because

6865.48 --> 6872.718999999999
of the context of what was happening in

6868.48 --> 6872.718999999999
there I could describe it

6875.199 --> 6883.119
perhaps would be better if I just found

6879.28 --> 6888.119
it oh wait I could look in the browser

6883.119 --> 6888.119
history I forgot about that that really

6888.679 --> 6891.679
works

6903.159 --> 6909.598999999999
yeah I found it oh my God this works

6906.76 --> 6911.88
great browser search it yeah the movie

6909.599 --> 6915.2390000000005
was called The November

6911.88 --> 6918.96
Man i' never seen that

6915.239 --> 6922.638999999999
before it was really intense but the

6918.96 --> 6924.159
plot was like like very very telling

6922.639 --> 6926.639
like

6924.159 --> 6930.36
that super

6926.639 --> 6933.4800000000005
revealing it's basically about [ __ ]

6930.36 --> 6935.759999999999
NATO [ __ ] NATO guys it is about it's

6933.48 --> 6939.718999999999
literally the movie is about yeah the

6935.76 --> 6942.84
Secret Service CIA [ __ ] is like

6939.719 --> 6945.4800000000005
literally trying to get in a new Russian

6942.84 --> 6948.04
president or whatever completely

6945.48 --> 6950.5599999999995
blackmailing him and controlling him by

6948.04 --> 6951.5199999999995
they wanted to turn Russia into a proxy

6950.56 --> 6953.679
State

6951.52 --> 6956.320000000001
basically there was a whole black it was

6953.679 --> 6958.32
all about blackmail [ __ ] and cleaning up

6956.32 --> 6961.48
ends

6958.32 --> 6966.32
and but it's it's basically about

6961.48 --> 6969.678999999999
that some dirty bastard CIA guy like

6966.32 --> 6973.599
nasty nasty figure I mean not that far

6969.679 --> 6973.599
away of like an Epstein type

6974.48 --> 6980.159
figure a little bit more military

6976.8 --> 6984.719
oriented though like and how we was just

6980.159 --> 6988.44
trying to trying to do

6984.719 --> 6991.0
that that was The November Man was

6988.44 --> 6992.919999999999
pretty rough I mean people get like

6991.0 --> 6995.52
really brutely murdered there it's

6992.92 --> 6998.84
really [ __ ] up in that sense but it

6995.52 --> 7000.52
was like a very serious movie very

6998.84 --> 7004.360000000001
serious action

7000.52 --> 7007.360000000001
movie and Pierce is just

7004.36 --> 7007.36
awesome

7008.48 --> 7012.199
it

7010.159 --> 7014.799999999999
anyway so I watched that and that made

7012.199 --> 7016.598999999999
me think of like wow yeah yeah a [ __ ]

7014.8 --> 7019.84
NATO

7016.599 --> 7022.360000000001
again like oh but we just have to do

7019.84 --> 7024.92
that

7022.36 --> 7029.079
otherwise otherwise we don't get the

7024.92 --> 7032.56
budget we have to overthrow and control

7029.079 --> 7036.239
the country to [ __ ] things up otherwise

7032.56 --> 7036.2390000000005
we don't get the military

7036.639 --> 7043.639
budget NATO United States yeah we

7043.84 --> 7048.76
know well that movie really showed

7054.239 --> 7060.959999999999
that you could say that it almost

7059.04 --> 7064.599
predicted

7060.96 --> 7067.36
Ukraine except in that movie it was

7064.599 --> 7070.52
Russia like good luck yeah good luck oh

7067.36 --> 7074.119
yeah we're just going to take away Putin

7070.52 --> 7075.84
yeah no right but if you thought in that

7074.119 --> 7078.679
movie like no we're actually talking

7075.84 --> 7081.52
about Ukraine and not Russia well then

7078.679 --> 7084.36
it's like holy [ __ ] that's literally

7081.52 --> 7087.96
what's happened that's literally what's

7084.36 --> 7087.96
happened in the real

7088.239 --> 7093.879999999999
world yeah The November Man check it out

7092.119 --> 7097.119
it's a brutal action movie but the

7093.88 --> 7097.119
plot's like

7098.32 --> 7106.5199999999995
fascinating of Dutch not part of NATO

7103.52 --> 7106.52
yeah

7109.079 --> 7114.88
so what do you mean why do you bring

7112.48 --> 7116.36
that up what I'm supposed to be [ __ ]

7114.88 --> 7120.159000000001
loyal to

7116.36 --> 7120.159
Nato NATO should be

7122.239 --> 7126.759999999999
disbanded the people that are

7124.36 --> 7129.28
responsible for all this crap that has

7126.76 --> 7131.320000000001
happened with Russia should be Deport

7129.28 --> 7134.599
reped to

7131.32 --> 7136.0
Russia to have maximum punishment

7134.599 --> 7139.04
delivered to

7136.0 --> 7141.76
them yeah that's what should really

7139.04 --> 7144.32
happen they're [ __ ] criminals they're

7141.76 --> 7144.320000000001

7205.04 --> 7208.8
2014 which is pretty much right around

7207.8 --> 7212.52
the

7208.8 --> 7216.079000000001
time where uh you know Ukraine Got

7212.52 --> 7220.2390000000005
overthrown so that makes it even

7216.079 --> 7223.04
more like yeah this is actually a movie

7220.239 --> 7225.759999999999
about what happened in

7223.04 --> 7228.44

7225.76 --> 7230.88
to stop it in the real world it didn't

7228.44 --> 7233.28
stop and

7230.88 --> 7235.639
then millions of ukrainians were

7233.28 --> 7239.119

recently because of

7243.719 --> 7251.119

7529.639 --> 7537.639
place I'd like to know CU I don't like

7533.52 --> 7541.92

chat all

7547.079 --> 7552.28
right social BL website

7555.61 --> 7561.719
[Music]

7557.84 --> 7565.4800000000005
okay so social blade does an estimation

7561.719 --> 7565.4800000000005
you realize that right it's an

7566.239 --> 7574.598999999999
estimate so it's not actually a cashed

7571.04 --> 7578.199
check it's not like oh here's here it is

7574.599 --> 7581.76
here's the numerical value that was

7578.199 --> 7581.759999999999
trans it to his bank

7582.559 --> 7587.84
account yeah social blade says a lot of

7585.36 --> 7590.799999999999
things about how much money people are

7587.84 --> 7594.84
making and it's not based on any actual

7590.8 --> 7597.8
evidence at all like not even remotely

7594.84 --> 7597.8
based on actual

7599.599 --> 7605.360000000001
evidence it's a fake

7602.8 --> 7611.079000000001
estimate an estimate of how much they

7605.36 --> 7611.079
could make if they would exploit it

7637.52 --> 7643.92
properly

7640.239 --> 7648.32
now clamy why you roll out what your

7643.92 --> 7648.32
social blade estimate is for my

7650.8 --> 7655.04
channel let's see how much of that makes

7667.52 --> 7670.52
sense

7672.52 --> 7676.4400000000005
whoa Sun

7679.639 --> 7685.679
woohoo look at

7682.239 --> 7688.32

7685.679 --> 7689.88
nice blue sky and Sun I'm I'm so happy

7688.32 --> 7694.0
about

7689.88 --> 7696.96
this I'm so going to go out in this and

7694.0 --> 7700.44
get some groceries

7696.96 --> 7700.44
later m

7709.679 --> 7712.2390000000005
hey Stevie

7727.4 --> 7730.4
Traveler

7736.719 --> 7742.76
wow on the high side it thinks I make

7740.679 --> 7746.36
about

7742.76 --> 7746.360000000001
27 pound a

7746.44 --> 7749.44
month

7753.239 --> 7757.32
what I can tell you immediately that

7755.639 --> 7760.32
that's

7757.32 --> 7760.32
wrong

7765.079 --> 7769.599
that's just incorrect that's like way

7787.32 --> 7790.32
off

7801.84 --> 7805.0
what [ __ ]

7808.599 --> 7813.639
is my

7811.079 --> 7814.639
God all right but yeah the estimated

7813.639 --> 7817.2390000000005
Revenue

7814.639 --> 7820.2390000000005
is40 a

7817.239 --> 7820.239
month

7847.239 --> 7850.239
for

7865.679 --> 7871.32
that's cool if that is way yeah but my

7867.76 --> 7871.320000000001
point is it's completely

7875.92 --> 7882.76
off yeah I mean if it's off like 50%

7879.96 --> 7884.96
with a Mei Channel like me what do you

7882.76 --> 7888.679
think it's going to do with like

7884.96 --> 7892.4
some attention grabby viral video going

7888.679 --> 7894.679
weirdo out there like that number makes

7892.4 --> 7897.719
absolutely no

7894.679 --> 7900.159
sense there's no way that he made that

7897.719 --> 7903.8
amount of money out of it no

7900.159 --> 7905.799999999999
way if he had he'd been bragging about

7903.8 --> 7910.159000000001
it for like half a

7905.8 --> 7910.159000000001
year I would

7913.44 --> 7916.44
he obviously

7924.679 --> 7931.4800000000005
didn't I mean I'm sure he made something

7927.28 --> 7934.0
out of it but not that much that's

7931.48 --> 7937.079
[ __ ] I'd never stop bragging if that

7934.0 --> 7940.079
were the case I'd never stop

7937.079 --> 7940.079
bragging

7940.199 --> 7942.678999999999
if I were

7950.719 --> 7956.0
ranty make 2,000 a month no

7963.4 --> 7969.199
way yeah he doesn't have any actual

7966.559 --> 7971.4400000000005
records to to prove that I think rant is

7969.199 --> 7973.919999999999
just lying

7971.44 --> 7977.119
paltin

7973.92 --> 7980.76
cuz he's not he's not been

7977.119 --> 7984.839999999999
shy with doing

7980.76 --> 7987.679
that yeah there is no freaking flat

7984.84 --> 7990.92
earther in the last 10 year that made

7987.679 --> 7993.92
2,000 a month not a single one it's a

7990.92 --> 7993.92
ridiculous

7996.96 --> 7999.96
glaim

8022.48 --> 8026.959999999999
could really cash all that today it

8024.8 --> 8029.079000000001
could be worth billions no no it

8026.96 --> 8031.119
wouldn't

8029.079 --> 8032.639
and besides as you're trying to cash it

8031.119 --> 8035.5199999999995
in there's a good chance that it will be

8032.639 --> 8040.159000000001
completely lost and destroyed

8035.52 --> 8043.079000000001
or you're going to lose like 99% of the

8040.159 --> 8046.638999999999
actual value as you're trying to cash

8043.079 --> 8046.639
it little Bild

8051.96 --> 8057.32
Evolution right I mean Bitcoin is only

8054.84 --> 8058.96
worth anything as long as you keep it

8057.32 --> 8061.04
and you don't sell it and you don't do

8058.96 --> 8064.44
anything with it soon as you try to

8061.04 --> 8066.92
transform it into cash it like totally

8064.44 --> 8069.199
disintegrates in value like everything

8066.92 --> 8072.52
about it is lost you don't get anything

8069.199 --> 8074.119
out of it you can just have it and think

8072.52 --> 8079.280000000001
it's worth a

8074.119 --> 8079.28
lot but it isn't it's a

8086.88 --> 8089.88
scam

8116.8 --> 8119.8
okay

8133.28 --> 8137.88
yeah and pel you can say it includes

8135.52 --> 8141.159000000001
patreon you yeah there's no

8137.88 --> 8142.639
way nobody's gotten that much out of it

8141.159 --> 8145.638999999999
at any

8142.639 --> 8145.639
stage

8146.8 --> 8149.8
palatin

8151.84 --> 8158.76
so it's obvious ranty lied it's not

8155.76 --> 8158.76
wouldn't have been the first

8159.639 --> 8167.599
time I mean the guy was continually like

8163.44 --> 8170.48
like hustling to work like in between

8167.599 --> 8173.0
his Flat Earth streams yeah you don't do

8170.48 --> 8175.759999999999
that if you make like 2,000 a month out

8173.0 --> 8175.76
of just

8176.719 --> 8179.719
that

8180.199 --> 8182.48
it's

8206.679 --> 8209.679
nonsense

8212.24 --> 8216.96
really happy about the sunny weather out

8214.2 --> 8219.16
there no Trails no

8216.96 --> 8221.88
nothing I have to be quick though before

8219.16 --> 8221.88

8225.92 --> 8230.04
down Brandon did

8230.639 --> 8234.16
confirm confirm

8236.599 --> 8239.599
what

8247.92 --> 8253.559
how the hell can Brandon confirm that

8250.76 --> 8256.92
like I don't think that RTI gave Brandon

8253.559 --> 8256.92
access to his bank

8266.599 --> 8269.599
account

8270.24 --> 8276.559

watch Owen Benjamin on both dive and

8278.639 --> 8281.399

8283.24 --> 8289.76

8286.16 --> 8289.76
great I'll give you the

8296.519 --> 8299.519
link

8309.84 --> 8313.92
oh by the way talking about witch

8311.719 --> 8316.358999999999
another ridiculous thing that I have to

8313.92 --> 8318.0
mention I do I really have to I could

8316.359 --> 8320.04
have just like forgotten about it and

8318.0 --> 8324.399
then nobody would have known

8320.04 --> 8326.599
but I got trolls everywhere including at

8324.399 --> 8328.439
Owen Benjamin and they're like so

8326.599 --> 8329.679
insistent of trolls calling me that they

8328.439 --> 8333.08
literally

8329.679 --> 8335.84
now gave yesterday they somebody like

8333.08 --> 8338.2
made a Super Chat to Owen Benjamin with

8335.84 --> 8341.04
the text Arwin is gay in it and he read

8338.2 --> 8345.0
it out

8341.04 --> 8345.0
seriously it's gone to that

8345.559 --> 8350.96
level there's some people out there that

8348.28 --> 8354.28
are like I don't know I'm like the new

8350.96 --> 8356.719
Trump or something to them they got

8354.28 --> 8359.479000000001
Arwin derangement syndrome and like

8356.719 --> 8362.678999999998
everywhere I oh they have to like talk

8359.479 --> 8366.679
[ __ ] about me like out of nothing like

8362.679 --> 8368.559
every time I speak up in there at Rumble

8366.679 --> 8371.28
and just say something that's like in in

8368.559 --> 8373.599
line with what Owen is saying they like

8371.28 --> 8375.679
there's this one guy that then every

8373.599 --> 8377.880000000001
time I say anything he has to say like

8375.679 --> 8384.04
oh it's Arwin the correct junk sucks

8377.88 --> 8386.8
dicks for cash and like every [ __ ]

8384.04 --> 8389.319000000001
time there's some seriously [ __ ]

8386.8 --> 8393.16
deranged people out there that are

8389.319 --> 8396.519999999999
like provably deranged and everybody

8393.16 --> 8398.56
just lets them talk [ __ ] about me I

8396.52 --> 8402.24
literally complained to codington like

8398.56 --> 8404.64
hey this guy is like a month now every

8402.24 --> 8406.119999999999
time I say anything he just starts

8404.64 --> 8408.64
talking

8406.12 --> 8411.12
[ __ ] just to

8408.64 --> 8413.519999999999
me but it seems like they're just

8411.12 --> 8416.359
leaving him there it's like oh no they

8413.52 --> 8418.52
they want anti-wind

8416.359 --> 8421.319
trolls I

8418.52 --> 8423.84
guess I have no idea why the hell that

8421.319 --> 8423.84
would be

8428.04 --> 8431.68
though it's quite

8433.28 --> 8438.720000000001
ridiculous right but anyway yeah that

8435.52 --> 8441.52
happened Owen Benjamin didn't even like

8438.72 --> 8446.16
notice like he he literally read it out

8441.52 --> 8446.16
and he didn't pay any thought to it at

8446.319 --> 8449.319
all

8455.72 --> 8459.319
but it's just weird that there's people

8457.56 --> 8463.399
out there doing that like what the [ __ ]

8459.319 --> 8467.24
is your problem why why just

8463.399 --> 8470.8
why why would you do that why is there

8467.24 --> 8476.24
entire hordes of freaks out there just

8470.8 --> 8479.56
trying to bmear my name wherever I go

8476.24 --> 8483.199999999999
why why are you doing

8479.56 --> 8487.359
that it makes no freaking sense like

8483.2 --> 8491.28
unless I am like a Savage threat to you

8487.359 --> 8493.12
because maybe at some point in history

8491.28 --> 8496.76
the things that I talk

8493.12 --> 8499.68
about as in revenge against people that

8496.76 --> 8502.68
allow themselves to be demonic might be

8499.68 --> 8505.56
real and that if I just keep doing what

8502.68 --> 8508.04
I doing that eventually these people

8505.56 --> 8510.199999999999
that know they're doing that will end up

8508.04 --> 8513.359
a torturous

8510.2 --> 8516.800000000001
death maybe that's why they're doing it

8513.359 --> 8522.2
huh cuz they know if they don't if I get

8516.8 --> 8522.199999999999
my momentum they're all going to

8524.08 --> 8528.2
die maybe that's why they're doing

8530.479 --> 8539.16
it cuz I definitely have a plan to purge

8535.12 --> 8539.160000000002
the world of demonic

8540.64 --> 8543.88
Behavior with

8545.68 --> 8553.92
Bloodshed I strive

8548.04 --> 8556.640000000001
to ban the demon out of humanity once

8553.92 --> 8560.64
again starting at the top of course

8556.64 --> 8563.64
otherwise there's absolutely no point

8560.64 --> 8563.64
whatsoever

8566.16 --> 8569.16
right

8572.2 --> 8577.560000000001
nobody who matters cares yeah I know

8574.64 --> 8580.319
that it's just

8577.56 --> 8583.88
why like why would you do like don't

8580.319 --> 8583.88
even do that with anybody

8586.04 --> 8592.800000000001
else like I've never seen

8589.8 --> 8596.759999999998
that like somebody that's not just like

8592.8 --> 8597.84
ow B is stupid it's a [ __ ] is a racist

8596.76 --> 8599.92
blah blah

8597.84 --> 8603.24
and then yeah you go like oh look who's

8599.92 --> 8606.359
the [ __ ] here I get it I don't do that

8603.24 --> 8608.119999999999
I'm supportive and I get trolls NE like

8606.359 --> 8611.2
to calling me

8608.12 --> 8614.479000000001
gay like what the

8611.2 --> 8617.640000000001
[ __ ] I'm just a guy that's enjoying the

8614.479 --> 8620.399
show and being inspired

8617.64 --> 8623.64
and why the hell are there trolls there

8620.399 --> 8626.08
telling everybody that I'm gay and I'm

8623.64 --> 8628.16
CIA and like

8626.08 --> 8630.64
whatever

8628.16 --> 8630.64
I don't get

8633.319 --> 8640.96
it like that seems

8637.279 --> 8640.960000000001
insane that that's

8656.0 --> 8659.0
there

8675.12 --> 8681.52
right oh yeah went

8678.319 --> 8681.519999999999
away all

8685.96 --> 8688.96
right

8692.56 --> 8696.039999999999
going for two hours 22

8701.76 --> 8706.880000000001
minutes right so yeah that happened too

8704.52 --> 8706.880000000001
that was

8706.96 --> 8715.278999999999
weird we talk about everything now oh

8710.84 --> 8717.479
yeah the movie November Man intense but

8715.279 --> 8719.6
like fascinating

8717.479 --> 8723.24
oh Benjamin calling me gay because of

8719.6 --> 8725.84
some Super Chat he didn't even

8723.24 --> 8729.399
notice did you say the weather was going

8725.84 --> 8732.68
to be good uh well it predicts that

8729.399 --> 8735.358999999999
tomorrow is going to be a sunny

8732.68 --> 8737.800000000001
day it kind of seems like that already

8735.359 --> 8739.24
but it says it's like completely Sunny

8737.8 --> 8742.56
no clouds

8739.24 --> 8745.76
tomorrow so yeah that's what it

8742.56 --> 8748.0
says in the predictions it might move

8745.76 --> 8749.6
further to the Sunday or something you

8748.0 --> 8752.399
never really know for sure but that's

8749.6 --> 8752.399000000001
what it says right

8753.52 --> 8759.84
now and I'm looking forward to

8757.52 --> 8762.359
it going to make sure I don't go to bed

8759.84 --> 8767.279
too late and get as much of that

8762.359 --> 8767.279
sunlight in the morning as

8775.8 --> 8778.8
possible

8784.12 --> 8791.279
it's good thing they're talking about

8786.52 --> 8791.279
you it's just weird dude it's

8792.84 --> 8799.8
weird like it's obvious Owen Benjamin

8796.24 --> 8801.96
like does not care he's probably seen my

8799.8 --> 8804.92
channel and immediately said I'm never

8801.96 --> 8804.919999999998
talking about that

8805.04 --> 8811.52
guy he must have otherwise I would have

8808.52 --> 8815.68
caught I I would have been addressed by

8811.52 --> 8820.12
now otherwise he's not doing it I think

8815.68 --> 8825.359
Owen Benjamin personally hates

8820.12 --> 8827.68
me and he can't justify it directly

8825.359 --> 8829.12
other than just summarizing what my

8827.68 --> 8832.12
situation

8829.12 --> 8832.12
is

8832.84 --> 8838.72
right I think he hates me I think he

8835.72 --> 8838.72
can't help it

8840.8 --> 8845.56
I just don't think

8843.24 --> 8850.24
he wants to

8845.56 --> 8850.24
be making mention of me because

8850.96 --> 8855.278999999999
then he would have to address

8863.279 --> 8868.12
that I do some crazy stuff here

8866.08 --> 8873.08
sometimes what do you you mean

8868.12 --> 8877.0
blo BL what do you mean crazy stuff

8873.08 --> 8882.279
I'm perfectly average normal

8877.0 --> 8882.279
guy I never do anything over the

8883.84 --> 8891.6
top yeah I'm being sarcastic right now

8887.16 --> 8894.8
but I mean who cares it's not even that

8891.6 --> 8896.960000000001
much talk about crushing skulls oh yeah

8894.8 --> 8899.679999999998
oh and that's nothing that's nothing

8896.96 --> 8903.96
compared to what I actually can think

8899.68 --> 8906.08
of can be way worse I can describe like

8903.96 --> 8909.199999999999
a nonstop hellish

8906.08 --> 8911.64
nightmare that'll literally give anybody

8909.2 --> 8917.479000000001
Shivers just listening to it I can't do

8911.64 --> 8917.479
that I don't do it though I avoid doing

8925.6 --> 8930.16
that

8928.399 --> 8932.96
but yes yeah I talk about crushing

8930.16 --> 8932.96
skulls that's

8942.279 --> 8949.720000000001
right yeah and hey physical P punishment

8947.88 --> 8952.278999999999
like eventually psychological

8949.72 --> 8955.519999999999
suppression and mind control just won't

8952.279 --> 8957.16
work everybody will become immune and

8955.52 --> 8960.0
demonic

8957.16 --> 8963.359
without physical

8960.0 --> 8966.319
consequences people will just adapt out

8963.359 --> 8968.319
of it and bypass

8966.319 --> 8969.92
everything and that's where we're at

8968.319 --> 8973.479
night right

8969.92 --> 8975.92
now there's hordes of demonic people and

8973.479 --> 8978.72
the only thing that's going to make them

8975.92 --> 8983.439
decline in numbers of that type of

8978.72 --> 8983.438999999998
behavior is brutal

8985.52 --> 8991.0
execution that's going to make them stop

8988.68 --> 8994.12
being like that

8991.0 --> 8998.56
yeah it will it will actually make them

8994.12 --> 9002.84
stop acting like that the demon will

8998.56 --> 9004.16
retract on average when you start giving

9002.84 --> 9007.68
physical

9004.16 --> 9010.479
punishment to those that fully engage

9007.68 --> 9013.319
with that form of

9010.479 --> 9014.519999999999
possession you have to physically punish

9013.319 --> 9018.039999999999
them

9014.52 --> 9022.68
brutally and that's the only

9018.04 --> 9025.84
way that possession form will

9022.68 --> 9028.76
decline that's the only way I'm sorry oh

9025.84 --> 9031.439
oh what did I tell did you say did I say

9028.76 --> 9034.52
that you had to like it did I say that I

9031.439 --> 9037.24
like it no it's just that's the way it

9034.52 --> 9038.2
is it's always been like that and in

9037.24 --> 9041.039999999999
this

9038.2 --> 9044.2
modernism we all think like oh we've

9041.04 --> 9047.52
we've outgrown that oh we're better than

9044.2 --> 9050.439
no you're not you're just more

9047.52 --> 9052.16
free and more inclined to become

9050.439 --> 9055.720000000001
possessed by a

9052.16 --> 9055.72
demon that's what it

9059.76 --> 9064.439
is and until there are physical

9062.399 --> 9068.399
consequences for

9064.439 --> 9068.399
sin it will stay like

9069.64 --> 9075.358999999999
that yeah we got freedom in the west

9073.64 --> 9077.039999999999
yeah freedom to be

9075.359 --> 9079.439
demonic

9077.04 --> 9079.439
that's your

9079.72 --> 9083.438999999998
freedom I don't want that

9094.6 --> 9101.6
freedom I want the

9096.8 --> 9104.319
freedom of sin being punished that's the

9101.6 --> 9104.319
freedom I

9105.359 --> 9108.359
want

9114.08 --> 9121.16
dealed with harshly when they regain

9116.399 --> 9124.68
influence no they need to be massively

9121.16 --> 9125.88
executed and like psychological profiles

9124.68 --> 9128.6
need to be

9125.88 --> 9131.64
created for Communists so that if

9128.6 --> 9135.359
somebody is falling into a communist

9131.64 --> 9138.278999999999
American Nation it is recognized and

9135.359 --> 9138.279
punishable

9162.64 --> 9167.84
yeah hates everyone who's under six foot

9165.399 --> 9170.119999999999
to well that's not fair that used to be

9167.84 --> 9173.2
5'

9170.12 --> 9174.84
s but who cares man I mean hey if Owen

9173.2 --> 9177.240000000002
just wants to hate

9174.84 --> 9179.880000000001
everybody and everything is gay and

9177.24 --> 9182.88
nothing is acceptable except things that

9179.88 --> 9185.64
are to his level and better well then

9182.88 --> 9188.16
it's not my [ __ ] problem if if

9185.64 --> 9190.84
there's no way for me to

9188.16 --> 9193.76
possibly get attain any kind of

9190.84 --> 9198.24
favorable position in relation to him

9193.76 --> 9200.52
then [ __ ] all of that [ __ ] all of them I

9198.24 --> 9200.52
don't

9200.64 --> 9207.68
care yeah I don't care with Nathan and I

9204.08 --> 9210.039999999999
don't care with Owen Benjamin I'm My Own

9207.68 --> 9213.16
guy I'm not

9210.04 --> 9215.6
dependent on whether somebody else is

9213.16 --> 9220.24
looking favorable upon

9215.6 --> 9223.960000000001
me yeah I do what I do I do it

9220.24 --> 9228.76
well and I don't care if they like me or

9223.96 --> 9228.759999999998
not like me especially if they're bigger

9230.399 --> 9235.599999999999
channels I I take a rule of fist that if

9233.279 --> 9238.12
they're really big and they don't

9235.6 --> 9241.56
diametrically oppose every single thing

9238.12 --> 9245.2
I say I should probably

9241.56 --> 9245.199999999999
worry that's what I

9253.04 --> 9258.080000000002
think being a shay all the way yeah

9258.72 --> 9264.84
it's not that's just one way right

9261.72 --> 9267.88
there's all kinds of great Heroes of the

9264.84 --> 9271.8
past who have fought

9267.88 --> 9275.358999999999
communism or try to like properly reform

9271.8 --> 9277.84
it that it isn't like it anymore there's

9275.359 --> 9280.76
people that are like in communism and

9277.84 --> 9284.68
then try to create a more right-wing

9280.76 --> 9287.279
thing out of it instead of total Marxist

9284.68 --> 9289.68
destruction it's all these

9287.279 --> 9292.92
figures and I find them extremely

9289.68 --> 9292.92
fascinating and

9293.2 --> 9297.240000000002
underrated and pet is one of

9306.04 --> 9311.560000000001
them right and even those that have

9308.399 --> 9314.08
tried and failed should still be

9311.56 --> 9316.88
respected like H

9314.08 --> 9319.64
Cassi he tried and failed

9316.88 --> 9319.64
the was

9320.92 --> 9324.16
overrun by

9325.96 --> 9330.519999999999
communist but he tried to hold on at

9328.399 --> 9332.84
least and then it didn't work and that's

9330.52 --> 9332.84
very

9334.08 --> 9338.64
tragic and there's other historical

9341.2 --> 9346.52
figures like I think that I would have

9344.16 --> 9349.52
to like do a little bit deeper diving on

9346.52 --> 9353.560000000001
it again to refresh in my memory about

9349.52 --> 9356.720000000001
it but Gaddafi could probably also be

9353.56 --> 9359.56
classified underneath that like the way

9356.72 --> 9362.438999999998
he's done thing is sort of

9359.56 --> 9368.319
communist but it isn't

9362.439 --> 9368.319
Marxist he tried to bring wealth to the

9369.16 --> 9373.92
people but that's unacceptable because

9372.24 --> 9376.039999999999
that's not what you're supposed to do if

9373.92 --> 9380.52
you're communist you're only supposed to

9376.04 --> 9383.479000000001
say that you're doing it and then steal

9380.52 --> 9388.359
everything for a rich

9383.479 --> 9393.519999999999
few right because that's what actual

9388.359 --> 9397.12
Communists do because the entirety of

9393.52 --> 9402.04
Communism the entirety of it was

9397.12 --> 9404.76
always a banker scam an illusion for the

9402.04 --> 9406.92
people to detach themselves from

9404.76 --> 9411.2
national identity

9406.92 --> 9415.359
and scoop all the riches up for the

9411.2 --> 9415.359
banker that's what it always

9416.479 --> 9423.278999999999
was communism is a gigantic Banker scam

9420.76 --> 9427.319
cuz real communism they don't accept

9423.279 --> 9430.439
that you get attacked you get

9427.319 --> 9433.8
slaughtered because you were actually

9430.439 --> 9435.880000000001
giving the things to the people you're

9433.8 --> 9438.399
not allowed to do that you're only

9435.88 --> 9440.0
allowed to promise that and then take

9438.399 --> 9442.68
everything from

9440.0 --> 9444.68
them and then perhaps torture them to

9442.68 --> 9446.84
death or hunger them starve them to

9444.68 --> 9449.319
death on top of it you know maybe poison

9446.84 --> 9453.279
them what that's all fine as long as you

9449.319 --> 9457.199999999999
don't actually give anything to the

9453.279 --> 9458.640000000001
people then it's then it's allowed by

9457.2 --> 9461.240000000002
the

9458.64 --> 9464.039999999999
Internationals yeah because you can't

9461.24 --> 9464.8
actually give anything to the people as

9464.04 --> 9467.800000000001
a

9464.8 --> 9471.8
communist cuz then you'd actually do

9467.8 --> 9473.399
what the the dream of Communism suggests

9471.8 --> 9478.039999999999
you're not supposed to do that you're

9473.399 --> 9480.92
only supposed to lie about it false

9478.04 --> 9484.080000000002
promises to make people abandon their

9480.92 --> 9489.6
Roots their National spirit all that to

9484.08 --> 9493.16
become mindless slaves to money

9489.6 --> 9497.720000000001
power that's what communism is it's all

9493.16 --> 9497.72
a lie everything about it is a lie

9504.399 --> 9510.599999999999
why and P knew that and he knew it so

9508.319 --> 9513.68
well that he had absolutely no

9510.6 --> 9517.24
hesitation but to torture the main

9513.68 --> 9517.24
communist conspirators to

9520.0 --> 9526.24
death yeah not because oh it's so nice

9523.2 --> 9529.479000000001
oh it's so funny no because it needs to

9526.24 --> 9534.52
happen because a signal needs to be sent

9529.479 --> 9537.438999999998
back to the Devils that own them like

9534.52 --> 9540.52
you're not getting any grip

9537.439 --> 9543.960000000001
here there's no room for Devils here

9540.52 --> 9543.960000000001
yeah we torture them to

9544.64 --> 9553.16
death which is what you should

9548.76 --> 9553.16
do p was

9554.399 --> 9557.64
right and

9569.399 --> 9575.358999999999
successful like children got some food

9571.92 --> 9577.8
for free it's hard to be against that no

9575.359 --> 9577.800000000001
it's all

9578.399 --> 9584.88
[ __ ] it's not

9581.72 --> 9586.199999999999
durable it doesn't matter what they say

9584.88 --> 9589.92
they've done good

9586.2 --> 9592.479000000001
it have absolutely no

9589.92 --> 9595.64
relevance the only thing it leads to is

9592.479 --> 9598.92
total Destruction it doesn't matter if

9595.64 --> 9602.24
it fed the children for a bit like

9598.92 --> 9602.24
completely not

9603.84 --> 9610.84
relevant now you want to feed the

9606.08 --> 9610.84
children well Feed the Children

9612.439 --> 9619.0
then yeah strings attach there always

9615.6 --> 9620.24
strings attached yeah create artificial

9619.0 --> 9624.439
short

9620.24 --> 9627.119999999999
shortage and then oh I can help you with

9624.439 --> 9629.0
this artificial shortage all you have to

9627.12 --> 9631.240000000002
do is sign away your sovereignty and

9629.0 --> 9634.92
give us all your control

9631.24 --> 9637.479
yes and then we can feed the children oh

9634.92 --> 9639.84
why do they need feeding oh well because

9637.479 --> 9643.0
yeah it's all being deprived on purpose

9639.84 --> 9645.880000000001
by designed by us yeah you want it to

9643.0 --> 9648.72
stop you just give us all your power

9645.88 --> 9651.759999999998
power yeah it's what they do this what

9648.72 --> 9654.72
communism is there is nothing a

9651.76 --> 9659.0
communist could do to justify giving

9654.72 --> 9659.0
them control nothing in the

9669.319 --> 9673.08
world I could make some harsher

9671.6 --> 9674.439
judgments about it but I'm not even

9673.08 --> 9677.439
going to go

9674.439 --> 9677.439
there

9681.319 --> 9686.0
but in a way I I would like to make a

9684.319 --> 9689.399
rough comparison

9686.0 --> 9692.12
to some of these African

9689.399 --> 9695.399
tribes that were supposedly getting

9692.12 --> 9697.560000000001
vaccinated right all of a sudden and

9695.399 --> 9700.439
then the village Elder literally chopped

9697.56 --> 9701.96
the arms off all the children in the

9700.439 --> 9702.84
shop that they had like they chopped it

9701.96 --> 9707.199999999999
all

9702.84 --> 9710.84
off yeah like

9707.2 --> 9710.84
that's the type of

9713.76 --> 9718.72
Direction

9715.56 --> 9720.24
like yeah yeah it is better to let those

9718.72 --> 9723.599999999999
children

9720.24 --> 9727.56
starve than to give into

9723.6 --> 9731.04
communism if it's really matters then

9727.56 --> 9731.039999999999
you should be able to fix

9731.359 --> 9736.880000000001
it but communism never fixed anything it

9734.439 --> 9741.12
only makes things worse

9736.88 --> 9743.679999999998
temporary relief expounded problems and

9741.12 --> 9746.319000000001
every time you give in it it all gets

9743.68 --> 9748.319
worse it gets worse permanently until at

9746.319 --> 9751.439
the end of it there is nothing but

9748.319 --> 9754.199999999999
torturous death without any

9751.439 --> 9757.64
recourse that's where that leads

9754.2 --> 9762.04
to without any recourse

9757.64 --> 9764.88
or root to be able to not deserve

9762.04 --> 9767.0
everything that happens to you then yeah

9764.88 --> 9768.64
that's where the end of the road is for

9767.0 --> 9771.96
giving into

9768.64 --> 9775.399
communism nothing justifies communism

9771.96 --> 9778.64
ever not a single thing it is a pure

9775.399 --> 9782.08
devil seduction and nothing can justify

9778.64 --> 9782.08
it nothing

9788.2 --> 9793.16
ever all right yeah thanks burn fat till

9791.56 --> 9794.278999999999
my stomach is flat as the Earth thanks

9793.16 --> 9797.279
for being here

9794.279 --> 9797.279
again

9810.72 --> 9815.84
right but yeah it is a tough subject and

9813.24 --> 9820.24
oh I might scare some people I don't

9815.84 --> 9820.24
care man I don't

9823.12 --> 9827.160000000002
care and yeah of course it was there's a

9825.479 --> 9829.56
lot of people that are scared because

9827.16 --> 9832.359
they know they are slaves of the devil

9829.56 --> 9835.278999999999
and at the end of the ride they will die

9832.359 --> 9838.16
for their treachery to

9835.279 --> 9842.16
humanity they know it and they know that

9838.16 --> 9846.16
I will be like the torchbearer that

9842.16 --> 9849.6
lits that lits that

9846.16 --> 9851.96
fuse of their Annihilation they know I'm

9849.6 --> 9853.399000000001
the torch Bearer for that's going to LIT

9851.96 --> 9856.839999999998
that

9853.399 --> 9859.519999999999
fuse that no matter what is said what is

9856.84 --> 9865.439
thought what is

9859.52 --> 9865.439
proposed I will let that

9872.439 --> 9879.720000000001
fuse it's the end of the road for

9876.72 --> 9883.319
communism within my lifetime and I'm

9879.72 --> 9888.56
going to do everything I can physically

9883.319 --> 9888.56
and spiritually to ensure

9895.8 --> 9903.438999999998
that the devil's ideology in this world

9900.16 --> 9903.439
must be

9914.08 --> 9917.08
eradicated

9931.76 --> 9938.04
right and the automated systems what is

9935.439 --> 9940.319
now the Beast system sort of should be

9938.04 --> 9942.880000000001
repurposed there should be other

9940.319 --> 9944.08
automated spiritual mechanisms that we

9942.88 --> 9948.319
can

9944.08 --> 9950.56
follow that aren't always going to lead

9948.319 --> 9953.84
down to Total

9950.56 --> 9957.88
self-destruction yeah because every real

9953.84 --> 9959.8
Road within communism leads to Total

9957.88 --> 9963.0
self

9959.8 --> 9966.679999999998
Annihilation and that it should no

9963.0 --> 9969.68
longer be acceptable it should be

9966.68 --> 9969.68
outlawed

9974.0 --> 9977.0
worldwide

9981.479 --> 9986.16
yeah and I'm not saying like oh

9983.56 --> 9987.16
deregulate no no no no regulation of

9986.16 --> 9990.52
course

9987.16 --> 9993.359
regulation Market regulation banking

9990.52 --> 9995.880000000001
regulation food regulation Health

9993.359 --> 9996.960000000001
regulation yeah regulation is great

9995.88 --> 9999.759999999998
right that's the one thing that

9996.96 --> 9999.759999999998
government should be

10001.2 --> 10010.84
doing just don't make the regul ations

10005.72 --> 10013.84
cause people to not be able to use it

10010.84 --> 10017.439
you don't kill the market by over

10013.84 --> 10020.72
regulating it and you don't let the

10017.439 --> 10024.399
demons take full Monopoly Power by

10020.72 --> 10024.399
completely having it

10024.439 --> 10028.04
unregulated om Benjamin talked about

10026.6 --> 10029.68
this too by the way yesterday it's a

10028.04 --> 10033.92
really good

10029.68 --> 10035.960000000001
point yeah don't over regulate

10033.92 --> 10038.64
then

10035.96 --> 10042.519999999999
it'll destroy the market don't under

10038.64 --> 10045.039999999999
regulate or overt demons will just take

10042.52 --> 10047.76
the power and then nobody can stop them

10045.04 --> 10050.560000000001
they'll have full Monopoly power so yeah

10047.76 --> 10053.76
there needs to be regulation

10050.56 --> 10059.88
everywhere especially with the market

10053.76 --> 10062.72
pure free trade is Hell pure free trade

10059.88 --> 10064.96
means unlimited criminal

10062.72 --> 10066.399
trade it wouldn't be criminal you

10064.96 --> 10067.839999999998
wouldn't even be able to call it

10066.399 --> 10070.358999999999
criminal anymore because nothing is

10067.84 --> 10072.04
outlawed anymore then yeah there

10070.359 --> 10074.16
definitely needs to be laws and

10072.04 --> 10078.279
regulations especially in

10074.16 --> 10080.279
trade but you don't over regulate it and

10078.279 --> 10084.800000000001
you don't under regulate it you have to

10080.279 --> 10084.800000000001
do it just right and that's

10085.0 --> 10091.72
tricky there's no Universal

10089.2 --> 10094.0
formula and if you follow the universal

10091.72 --> 10097.519999999999
formula it will always be all right no

10094.0 --> 10099.6
you have to f figure it out per

10097.52 --> 10102.399000000001
region per

10099.6 --> 10105.04
field what is the proper regulation

10102.399 --> 10107.24
balance what is good what will lead to

10105.04 --> 10110.880000000001
more

10107.24 --> 10110.88
good and it's

10111.6 --> 10120.2
difficult over taxation yeah but but

10115.359 --> 10124.439
regulation Taxation and regulation

10120.2 --> 10126.640000000001
like those are like tricks right so

10124.439 --> 10128.720000000001
sometimes you have to tax something

10126.64 --> 10131.8
because you want to discourage people

10128.72 --> 10134.88
from engaging with it not because the

10131.8 --> 10138.199999999999
tax money is needed but because they the

10134.88 --> 10140.72
system the design of it wants people to

10138.2 --> 10144.880000000001
approach the whole

10140.72 --> 10149.278999999999
thing in a different way it's like to

10144.88 --> 10152.72
guide the Sheep into a specific pen and

10149.279 --> 10155.640000000001
so the other pen is going to be taxed or

10152.72 --> 10158.64
closed off or they get a shock if they

10155.64 --> 10163.84
want to go there so that they don't

10158.64 --> 10163.84
choose that and go the way that is

10165.239 --> 10170.239
regulated right so yeah if you literally

10168.64 --> 10171.88
tax everything that will just make

10170.239 --> 10175.399
economy a possible that will make

10171.88 --> 10178.0
everything create losses it's

10175.399 --> 10183.519999999999
terrible it

10178.0 --> 10186.279
sucks but taxation is also a trick of

10183.52 --> 10188.16
Regulation you attacks this one thing

10186.279 --> 10189.479000000001
because you kind of want everybody to

10188.16 --> 10192.88
not do

10189.479 --> 10195.679999999998
that or do it less compared to the other

10192.88 --> 10201.119999999999
way that you do want everybody to do it

10195.68 --> 10201.12
as right and that's not

10202.439 --> 10209.64
communist and it's

10205.52 --> 10209.640000000001
not pure free market

10210.04 --> 10216.640000000001
capitalism it's in between it's in a in

10213.68 --> 10216.64
a neutral zone

10217.479 --> 10223.64
of contemporary

10219.72 --> 10223.64
judgment and it's how it should

10225.88 --> 10231.8
be right it should be

10229.04 --> 10234.080000000002
developing and changing over time

10231.8 --> 10235.56
depending on how people are doing and

10234.08 --> 10238.279
how they're learning and how they're

10235.56 --> 10240.76
growing through all of it it's a dynamic

10238.279 --> 10240.76
process

10242.64 --> 10247.0
effectively right anyhow I'm I'm going

10244.8 --> 10250.0
to run out the

10247.0 --> 10252.04
show thanks everyone for coming I hope

10250.0 --> 10253.56
you like this show it was kind of all

10252.04 --> 10256.6
over the place

10253.56 --> 10259.239
today but yeah some interesting subjects

10256.6 --> 10259.239
have come

10259.6 --> 10264.2
by think of Russia is a communist

10261.64 --> 10267.479
country no it's not a communist

10264.2 --> 10269.880000000001
country you might have some communist

10267.479 --> 10273.278999999999
old structures to it but it isn't

10269.88 --> 10276.679999999998
Marxist like that at all if anything

10273.279 --> 10279.239
they are like a form of right-wing

10276.68 --> 10282.960000000001
communism conservative

10279.239 --> 10287.439
communism which is the only

10282.96 --> 10287.438999999998
durable incarnation of

10288.84 --> 10297.04
it right what makes communism bad it's

10293.239 --> 10300.72
anti-nationalism it is the

10297.04 --> 10300.720000000001
self-destruction not the

10300.76 --> 10307.479
form to all have like a universal

10305.239 --> 10309.08
ideal in a way and like something you

10307.479 --> 10311.96
strive towards well that's the same

10309.08 --> 10315.52
driver as Liberty it's the same

10311.96 --> 10319.358999999999
one except that communism strives

10315.52 --> 10322.0
against the national spirit and against

10319.359 --> 10325.08
procreation and against God and all that

10322.0 --> 10328.399
[ __ ] yeah that's that's really what is

10325.08 --> 10331.52
making communism the devil's ideology

10328.399 --> 10334.8
it's those striving points it's not the

10331.52 --> 10336.0
form of it all it's not that they all

10334.8 --> 10338.479
fall in

10336.0 --> 10340.56
line those parts are actually quite

10338.479 --> 10343.519999999999
useful and they can

10340.56 --> 10346.519999999999
be

10343.52 --> 10349.04
assimilated in what I would call

10346.52 --> 10352.399000000001
conservative

10349.04 --> 10354.319000000001
communism yeah a form of Communism where

10352.399 --> 10358.8
God is

10354.319 --> 10363.0
Central where individual rights are

10358.8 --> 10366.319
respected is just the spirit of the

10363.0 --> 10369.04
nation Spirit of the nation can be like

10366.319 --> 10371.08
that sort of communist

10369.04 --> 10373.84
Factor

10371.08 --> 10376.64
patriotism

10373.84 --> 10378.92
right you basically take the entire

10376.64 --> 10380.68
setup of a Communist Regime and then you

10378.92 --> 10383.239
flip everything inside

10380.68 --> 10385.399
out and then you have conservative

10383.239 --> 10387.08
communism and that can actually be quite

10385.399 --> 10389.358999999999
good and I think that if there's

10387.08 --> 10391.96
anything close to that it's probably the

10389.359 --> 10395.399000000001
Russian government right now is kind of

10391.96 --> 10398.8
like that because they really Grew From

10395.399 --> 10401.039999999999
That Old communist Marxist system and

10398.8 --> 10402.8
then basically flipped it inside out and

10401.04 --> 10405.399000000001
so they still have the same form but

10402.8 --> 10406.8
they just do everything from a different

10405.399 --> 10410.72
angle of

10406.8 --> 10413.759999999998
approach much more sensible and with God

10410.72 --> 10417.679999999998
approach and not oh let's create chaos

10413.76 --> 10417.68
and destruction so we can stay on

10419.2 --> 10424.92
top which is what typical Soviet

10423.359 --> 10427.08
communist

10424.92 --> 10429.279
bureaucrats would

10427.08 --> 10432.16
do that's what they're trying to do in

10429.279 --> 10432.16
the west now in

10432.76 --> 10438.68
Europe right but it's the

10435.04 --> 10440.479000000001
self-destructive nature and all that

10438.68 --> 10443.279
that is within communism that is

10440.479 --> 10445.64
actually the the terrible thing about it

10443.279 --> 10449.399000000001
it's not the entire form of it that's

10445.64 --> 10450.88
not the bad thing it's it's that Marxism

10449.399 --> 10453.278999999999
it's that self-destruction the

10450.88 --> 10456.16
anti-nationalism

10453.279 --> 10459.76
anti-individualism that's the

10456.16 --> 10459.76
rot that's the

10467.279 --> 10471.12
evil

10468.92 --> 10473.88
anyway I'm going to continue rounding

10471.12 --> 10478.720000000001
out yeah by the way good to see you
