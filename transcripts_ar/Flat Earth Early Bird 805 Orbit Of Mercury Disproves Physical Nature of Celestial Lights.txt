most of the snow still there just as

97.2 --> 102.799
as it was yesterday doesn't seem like

98.88 --> 105.759
any of it has melted except for

102.799 --> 108.07900000000001
surfaces where the sun warms it up the

105.759 --> 108.079
most

111.04 --> 116.64
and the roads that have been cleared

113.52 --> 120.15899999999999
from snow seem pretty dry too

116.64 --> 120.159

207.17 --> 210.41
[Music]

211.44 --> 215.28
yeah yesterday's flat earth debate was

213.84 --> 218.56
pretty good

215.28 --> 220.64000000000001
and by the way so was my show i thought

218.56 --> 223.12
a couple of silent pauses but it's still

220.64 --> 223.11999999999998
pretty good

224.84 --> 230.4
uh

227.28 --> 230.959
right but yeah on the flat earth debate

230.4 --> 234.159
yesterday

230.959 --> 238.84
rompus and ed got on again

234.159 --> 240.07999999999998
and so it was a pretty amusing friday

238.84 --> 244.0
show

240.08 --> 246.08
did get go out for groceries

244.0 --> 247.12
so i missed the end bit of the after

246.08 --> 250.56
show

247.12 --> 250.56
i don't know how long it went on

250.73 --> 254.56
[Music]

252.48 --> 256.479
at least i think i did did i miss the

254.56 --> 257.6
end or was that the day before i don't

256.479 --> 260.4
remember

257.6 --> 262.47900000000004
right uh then yeah i watched a bunch of

260.4 --> 265.52
info wars and all that

262.479 --> 269.03999999999996
and eventually in the evening yeah i got

265.52 --> 272.24
on mr sensibles

269.04 --> 274.47900000000004
i don't know how many of you

272.24 --> 275.84000000000003
realize that or care to watch i know

274.479 --> 278.4
here we go again

275.84 --> 280.15999999999997
was there in chat and then got i don't

278.4 --> 280.71999999999997
know got banned or something or timed

280.16 --> 284.47900000000004
out

280.72 --> 287.68
it was weird but

284.479 --> 287.68
yeah i went on there

290.16 --> 294.47900000000004
and it started out kind of okay but

293.04 --> 297.12
eventually i just got

294.479 --> 298.71999999999997
kind of like scattergunned by the chat

297.12 --> 299.919
that's how mr sensible does it

298.72 --> 302.08000000000004
apparently

299.919 --> 303.919
with just super chats and the same type

302.08 --> 306.88
of questions over and

303.919 --> 308.24
over again by a lot of different people

306.88 --> 311.759
and it was kind of tiresome

308.24 --> 314.96000000000004
constantly having to answer questions

311.759 --> 320.56
related to celestial sites

314.96 --> 320.56
and yeah it was to me was between

321.759 --> 328.08000000000004
between 11 and

324.96 --> 329.52
1 o'clock or something was it or was it

328.08 --> 333.75899999999996
between 10

329.52 --> 335.84
no i think 11 right and

333.759 --> 337.36
eventually i just got tired out you know

335.84 --> 340.15999999999997
because

337.36 --> 340.47900000000004
in that time slot in the day i'm just

340.16 --> 344.0
not

340.479 --> 346.56
all that energetic so i can

344.0 --> 348.479
like peacefully just go through

346.56 --> 349.36
conversations but if i'm constantly

348.479 --> 352.639
going to be

349.36 --> 354.32
tested somehow by people only giving me

352.639 --> 357.52
questions that

354.32 --> 360.56
require me to defend

357.52 --> 363.12
like i i wasn't in for that really

360.56 --> 364.639
just it's the same baller stuff over and

363.12 --> 366.639
over again

364.639 --> 367.68
and i already gave some i thought i did

366.639 --> 370.72
some really good

367.68 --> 372.8
i did a really good job in there

370.72 --> 375.199
especially putting down the whole mars

372.8 --> 377.44
orbit situation

375.199 --> 379.52000000000004
to which mr sensible did not have an

377.44 --> 379.919
answer because i really did kind of push

379.52 --> 383.35999999999996
him on

379.919 --> 386.4
it didn't yeah he had

383.36 --> 388.16
taken some notice of it but it was very

386.4 --> 389.919
superficial so obviously it was

388.16 --> 390.88000000000005
something that he couldn't really get

389.919 --> 394.0
into

390.88 --> 396.4
though he did give some

394.0 --> 398.8
recognition that it is some kind of a

396.4 --> 400.56
problem that he just didn't understand

398.8 --> 403.199
yeah that's when he didn't understand

400.56 --> 406.8
very convenient to just

403.199 --> 408.56
then not respond right

406.8 --> 410.319
but i thought that i did a good job on

408.56 --> 414.96
that

410.319 --> 414.96000000000004
uh hey hello m first in chat

419.68 --> 426.56
right but yeah doing it

423.039 --> 428.88
mr sensible on his own

426.56 --> 431.12
i guess yeah i did pick up on a lot of

428.88 --> 434.639
just suppressed stuff

431.12 --> 435.36
it's quite obvious like he is holding up

434.639 --> 437.84000000000003
an act

435.36 --> 439.759
just absolutely certainly he is it's

437.84 --> 443.52
just palpable

439.759 --> 444.639
and i don't care to yeah go into detail

443.52 --> 448.4
on that

444.639 --> 451.52
but that the chat was so toxic

448.4 --> 453.919
and then yeah oh but look at look at

451.52 --> 455.44
nathan's chat right oh nathan's chat is

453.919 --> 459.68
so toxic oh really is it

455.44 --> 462.8
really toxic from flatter sides

459.68 --> 465.84000000000003
that just make jokes about ballers and

462.8 --> 465.84000000000003
call them stupid

466.24 --> 475.039
and why right

470.16 --> 478.47900000000004
is it so toxic is is the flat earth chat

475.039 --> 480.87899999999996
over at nathan so toxic is it well

478.479 --> 482.479
over at mr sensibles i was like

480.879 --> 486.16
scattergun by chat

482.479 --> 489.44
by i don't know i didn't keep track of

486.16 --> 490.56
who was saying what but i saw my name

489.44 --> 493.199
over that

490.56 --> 494.319
over that time period like a thousand

493.199 --> 499.84000000000003
times in people

494.319 --> 502.08000000000004
only just ad homing me just ad homing

499.84 --> 503.75899999999996
right yeah here we go again you you were

502.08 --> 508.479
there in chat

503.759 --> 512.0
so can you give any commentary of

508.479 --> 515.5989999999999
like how many at homes were

512.0 --> 520.959
or pointed in my direction it was just

515.599 --> 523.839
unbelievable and yeah so even though the

520.959 --> 524.3199999999999
conversation was kind of halfway decent

523.839 --> 526.1600000000001
i got

524.32 --> 528.08
rumpus a couple of times which is

526.16 --> 528.64
annoying you know somebody asked a

528.08 --> 531.12
question

528.64 --> 532.24
and then after half a second of me

531.12 --> 533.92
instantly

532.24 --> 536.0
responding as soon as the question is

533.92 --> 537.519
asked i get overrumpushed by him that

536.0 --> 539.519
was kind of annoying but i don't think

537.519 --> 541.76
he did it on purpose

539.519 --> 546.0
you know when i pointed it out he did

541.76 --> 548.24
try to do his best to not do that

546.0 --> 549.68
but yeah so even though the conversation

548.24 --> 552.88
went kind of decently

549.68 --> 554.4799999999999
the chat which was there and mr sensible

552.88 --> 558.0
was reading that

554.48 --> 559.839
and i saw him gloating over it on camera

558.0 --> 562.959
because i did see him on camera

559.839 --> 566.0
on the youtube he was gloating over it

562.959 --> 567.3599999999999
right didn't say that to me but i could

566.0 --> 571.2
see his face

567.36 --> 573.519
you know it just

571.2 --> 575.6800000000001
it was not very pleasant i really felt

573.519 --> 576.0
like i was being put on a pedestal for

575.68 --> 580.16
people

576.0 --> 580.16
to row throw rotten tomatoes at

580.56 --> 585.5999999999999
and to make mr sensible look like such a

582.8 --> 588.0
tolerant person for not doing that

585.6 --> 591.839
even though in his entire audience was

588.0 --> 591.839
doing that

592.0 --> 595.76
so i don't think i'm i'm gonna go on

594.08 --> 598.8000000000001
there again it's just

595.76 --> 600.0
the environment is just so toxic that i

598.8 --> 603.12
still

600.0 --> 605.839
feel it i still feel it it's really

603.12 --> 605.839
grossed me out

607.36 --> 610.9590000000001
like who is going to watch that show is

610.24 --> 614.5600000000001
like

610.959 --> 617.279
who would want to watch that show just

614.56 --> 618.16
by their own volition it's all bitter

617.279 --> 622.079
people like

618.16 --> 626.079
really bitter hateful people

622.079 --> 630.8389999999999
that are like vengeful for i don't know

626.079 --> 633.8389999999999
flat earthers telling them that might be

630.839 --> 633.839
incorrect

634.16 --> 638.399
so yeah even though i did put out those

637.279 --> 640.88
arguments i don't think

638.399 --> 642.88
anybody is going to be hearing it

640.88 --> 644.32
that'll be open-minded and actually

642.88 --> 646.88
listen to anything i said

644.32 --> 648.32
like not a word you know i put out

646.88 --> 650.72
conceptuals

648.32 --> 652.9590000000001
in there it went just for our win and

650.72 --> 655.839
just said no no holographic skies

652.959 --> 657.3599999999999
this is how i came to the conclusion and

655.839 --> 659.36
all that

657.36 --> 660.72
and they were all just like oh my god is

659.36 --> 665.44
so silly

660.72 --> 668.72
fantasist arwen and his crazy ideas

665.44 --> 671.2
right and i'm just they're laying out

668.72 --> 672.88
how i came to these conclusions and they

671.2 --> 675.12
just don't have any respect for that

672.88 --> 678.16
whatsoever

675.12 --> 680.72
they kept nagging me with more imagery

678.16 --> 681.519
like oh look but what about this eclipse

680.72 --> 684.5600000000001
and what about

681.519 --> 685.68
that and oh why do these celestial

684.56 --> 688.88
bodies why are they

685.68 --> 690.4799999999999
visible and are in shadow when they go

688.88 --> 691.68
in front of the sun and all that and i'm

690.48 --> 694.9590000000001
like yeah

691.68 --> 695.519
i don't know i don't know why that

694.959 --> 697.3599999999999
happens

695.519 --> 699.44
the way it happens it's all very

697.36 --> 702.72
mysterious

699.44 --> 704.6400000000001
but that i would just leave that open

702.72 --> 707.279
and say it's mysterious that was just

704.64 --> 708.48
completely unacceptable they were really

707.279 --> 712.0
offended by that

708.48 --> 712.0
like really offended

713.92 --> 717.8389999999999
and yeah

719.2 --> 723.12
so it was a bit of a bummer actually

723.18 --> 726.42
[Music]

726.48 --> 730.639
but it is absolutely due to the time

729.36 --> 733.76
slot like for me

730.639 --> 735.36
it just doesn't work because i don't

733.76 --> 737.12
i don't have a lot of spice in me i

735.36 --> 740.48
don't have a lot of will to go

737.12 --> 743.2
against it you know and

740.48 --> 744.32
well i also i was gonna keep it civil

743.2 --> 745.9200000000001
overall

744.32 --> 748.0790000000001
but yeah when you do that then

745.92 --> 748.56
eventually just the scatter gunning of

748.079 --> 752.2399999999999
it all

748.56 --> 752.2399999999999
it it starts to tire you out

752.56 --> 757.04
and you can't really do anything to

754.48 --> 760.399
defend against it because they're just

757.04 --> 763.4399999999999
underhandedly keep jabbing

760.399 --> 765.68
and not over not so much overtly

763.44 --> 765.6800000000001
so

769.92 --> 775.279
then again i did get a little bit

772.16 --> 778.079
snappier in there but i was just

775.279 --> 778.48
i was just really tired trying to put

778.079 --> 782.399
that

778.48 --> 785.2
point out as clear as possible so that

782.399 --> 788.959
even though they would normally evade it

785.2 --> 788.9590000000001
with their conscious that they would

789.04 --> 795.279
see it and not be able to unsee it

792.0 --> 795.279
that's kind of what i tried to do

797.07 --> 802.0790000000001
[Music]

798.32 --> 802.5600000000001
oh hello good servant i am above all

802.079 --> 805.4399999999999
that

802.56 --> 805.4399999999999
above oh what

807.04 --> 819.12
do i put me on a pedestal now

814.0 --> 819.12
only human here whatever that means

824.16 --> 827.76
ah thank you here we go again i really

826.0 --> 830.48
appreciate that i hadn't asked for your

827.76 --> 830.48
opinion yet

834.32 --> 836.9590000000001
but thank you

837.68 --> 841.04
i haven't listened back to it i don't

839.199 --> 844.16

841.04 --> 844.16
listened to it

845.92 --> 856.3199999999999

it's not easy though especially because

871.839 --> 876.72
of financial

872.8 --> 879.76
situation right

876.72 --> 881.9200000000001
just because i shared some

879.76 --> 883.76
potential hopeful situation of the

881.92 --> 884.3199999999999
future doesn't mean that i'm there right

883.76 --> 888.24
now

884.32 --> 888.24
because again i'm almost broke

888.88 --> 893.6
i really need to support i really do

896.639 --> 900.8
as in paypal support if possible

901.12 --> 904.8
otherwise i'm gonna have to borrow again

903.199 --> 907.279
and i got some bills

904.8 --> 910.24
that are substantial so i got a problem

907.279 --> 914.0
right now i got a financial problem

910.24 --> 918.399
like my maneuvering room as

914.0 --> 920.399
is basically about to die entirely

918.399 --> 922.16
and i don't exactly know what to do and

920.399 --> 923.12
yeah if that situation with the

922.16 --> 927.04
financial

923.12 --> 928.16
hope doesn't happen i'm absolutely gonna

927.04 --> 932.24
be screwed

928.16 --> 934.24
unless i get some significant support

932.24 --> 936.0
and i'm already getting some from

934.24 --> 939.279
certain very loyal people

936.0 --> 943.199
that have supported me over the years

939.279 --> 948.639
but i really need more and to be fair

943.199 --> 951.7589999999999
like holy [ __ ] dude like mr sensible

948.639 --> 954.0790000000001
like he has unbelievable

951.759 --> 957.44
amounts of support like unbelievable

954.079 --> 957.4399999999999
there's so many people just

958.399 --> 965.199
like insist

962.48 --> 966.32
that he is financially successful

965.199 --> 969.68
apparently

966.32 --> 971.44
so he has a lot of fans and yeah that

969.68 --> 975.4399999999999
did get me jealous

971.44 --> 977.44
it did a little pissed off

975.44 --> 979.519
like yeah and here i am as a flat

977.44 --> 982.5600000000001
earther now again

979.519 --> 985.92
at least i don't have to

982.56 --> 988.8
be like that because i know you know i

985.92 --> 988.8
know what happens

988.959 --> 992.2399999999999
like it's not like nobody's ever

991.36 --> 994.399
suggested it

992.24 --> 995.519
right like what what would happen if you

994.399 --> 997.839
just stop

995.519 --> 999.279
saying your ethos just stop that just

997.839 --> 1000.0
start talking about something why don't

999.279 --> 1002.8
you

1000.0 --> 1005.12
join these people and talk about the

1002.8 --> 1007.5999999999999
issues

1005.12 --> 1009.199
in the model heliocentric model and help

1007.6 --> 1011.6
to try and fix it right

1009.199 --> 1012.399
yeah yeah well i'd still be a flat

1011.6 --> 1014.399
earther

1012.399 --> 1016.16
because that's the only way i can even

1014.399 --> 1018.399
fix the model

1016.16 --> 1020.24
right because because of that i can

1018.399 --> 1022.399
actually understand what it is and

1020.24 --> 1024.24
what's going on and how to potentially

1022.399 --> 1027.12
maneuver things

1024.24 --> 1028.4
where people's mind will go so i even if

1027.12 --> 1031.9189999999999
i did that i would

1028.4 --> 1034.4
always be plagued always

1031.919 --> 1036.0790000000002
the rest of my life with my online

1034.4 --> 1039.76
activities

1036.079 --> 1041.6789999999999
by these people i know i will i know

1039.76 --> 1043.52
even if i like officially

1041.679 --> 1045.8390000000002
made a declaration like like i'm not

1043.52 --> 1047.6
doing flat earth anymore i

1045.839 --> 1049.039
i'm gonna talk about everything except

1047.6 --> 1052.1599999999999
flat earth right

1049.039 --> 1054.96
they'd still plague me for the rest of

1052.16 --> 1057.679
my online activity life

1054.96 --> 1059.52
yeah i know that i know that i'm not

1057.679 --> 1062.72
dumb

1059.52 --> 1066.08
so it would be useless

1062.72 --> 1069.3600000000001
like what i want to do it is it demands

1066.08 --> 1070.1599999999999
flat earth basically that's what i'm

1069.36 --> 1074.8799999999999
doing

1070.16 --> 1078.0800000000002
and cosmogeny and all that but

1074.88 --> 1081.2800000000002
because it is flat earth

1078.08 --> 1083.12
it's just never really it's always going

1081.28 --> 1084.559
to be like this it's always going to be

1083.12 --> 1088.559
just me in a corner

1084.559 --> 1091.84
with a lot of very angry bitter people

1088.559 --> 1094.799
mocking me all the time everywhere

1091.84 --> 1096.559
all over the place thousands of people

1094.799 --> 1097.52
if they're really all people you know i

1096.559 --> 1100.72
don't even know

1097.52 --> 1103.84
you know it it might be very easy

1100.72 --> 1108.72
to just have bots that do that

1103.84 --> 1110.3999999999999
it might be very easy you know

1108.72 --> 1112.0
so i don't even know how many of these

1110.4 --> 1113.919
people are real

1112.0 --> 1116.0
and it doesn't even matter if they are

1113.919 --> 1117.8400000000001
real people really the the point is is

1116.0 --> 1119.44
there's plenty of people around

1117.84 --> 1122.08
that are getting giant amounts of

1119.44 --> 1123.28
support just to keep mocking flat

1122.08 --> 1125.9189999999999
earthers

1123.28 --> 1127.039
and in the meantime i'm just stumbling

1125.919 --> 1130.64
around

1127.039 --> 1134.72
trying to stay financially afloat to not

1130.64 --> 1137.6000000000001
drown in debt from living right

1134.72 --> 1138.24
it's not it's not very gratifying to be

1137.6 --> 1141.9189999999999
fair

1138.24 --> 1145.52
that part then again

1141.919 --> 1149.5200000000002
yeah i love cosmogeny i always have

1145.52 --> 1153.52
and i can do this i'm doing this

1149.52 --> 1156.559
because i know i can do this

1153.52 --> 1158.559
right sometimes i feel i'm the only one

1156.559 --> 1161.84
that can actually do this

1158.559 --> 1163.9189999999999
i've never met anybody

1161.84 --> 1167.1999999999998
that could deal with cosmog need the way

1163.919 --> 1167.2
i have never

1168.4 --> 1173.76
and it also makes me kind of lonely so

1170.48 --> 1173.76
yeah i'm gonna be a bit of a

1173.919 --> 1178.5590000000002
little sad are we right now because i

1176.72 --> 1178.88
really need support and by the way thank

1178.559 --> 1180.8799999999999
you

1178.88 --> 1182.3200000000002
m for the 10 pound super chat donation

1180.88 --> 1185.3600000000001
that's very

1182.32 --> 1188.799
supportive of you fortunately though

1185.36 --> 1192.8799999999999
super chats they uh

1188.799 --> 1196.48
they don't really financially help me

1192.88 --> 1198.48
i'm yeah i i don't know

1196.48 --> 1200.72
how long ago it is that i shared that

1198.48 --> 1202.72
but they don't because i live on social

1200.72 --> 1206.159
welfare i'm in a pretty financially

1202.72 --> 1208.48
petty situation

1206.159 --> 1210.0
right and because of that all the super

1208.48 --> 1212.88
chats

1210.0 --> 1214.48
get piled on to my income that i get

1212.88 --> 1217.2800000000002
from google

1214.48 --> 1218.96
and i have to report that to the

1217.28 --> 1219.6
government that gives me my social

1218.96 --> 1222.64
welfare

1219.6 --> 1224.08
and they take all of it every time every

1222.64 --> 1225.919
month

1224.08 --> 1227.1999999999998
so i don't get anything of that it's

1225.919 --> 1230.96
like what i get out of it

1227.2 --> 1234.32
is is it like

1230.96 --> 1237.8400000000001
two and a half percent of the

1234.32 --> 1240.799
initial amount it's nothing so please if

1237.84 --> 1242.3999999999999
you actually want to help me financially

1240.799 --> 1243.84
survive here

1242.4 --> 1246.4
it's going to have to be paypal

1243.84 --> 1249.84
donations those work the best

1246.4 --> 1253.1200000000001
very thankful for paypal not

1249.84 --> 1256.24
nagging me not

1253.12 --> 1259.52
trying to cut me off not that i

1256.24 --> 1260.159
have had that incredible amount of money

1259.52 --> 1262.24
through it

1260.159 --> 1265.2800000000002
although to me it is you know i have had

1262.24 --> 1268.559
a lot of support it did really help me

1265.28 --> 1270.72
in the last few years so maybe

1268.559 --> 1273.44
because it's not too much they don't nag

1270.72 --> 1276.64
me about it

1273.44 --> 1278.72
i hope that is it or

1276.64 --> 1279.76
i don't i don't know but i'm i'm glad

1278.72 --> 1282.96
that they're not

1279.76 --> 1282.96
bothering me too much

1285.919 --> 1292.48
but i really need your support

1290.48 --> 1294.32
and i also need to talk more about it

1292.48 --> 1299.039
and i really hate it i

1294.32 --> 1299.039
really really hate it i hate

1299.12 --> 1304.08
asking for money it's not that i'm

1301.039 --> 1307.6
ashamed to do it

1304.08 --> 1309.84
it's just that i know that i've

1307.6 --> 1311.6789999999999
got watchers and people and supporters

1309.84 --> 1314.8799999999999
that support me

1311.679 --> 1318.0
for me as a person for whatever

1314.88 --> 1320.48
trait about me that they like right

1318.0 --> 1322.4
or some social reason because of my

1320.48 --> 1323.28
isolation and the sympathy for it

1322.4 --> 1325.52
perhaps

1323.28 --> 1327.12
perhaps they recognize things in me that

1325.52 --> 1329.52
they

1327.12 --> 1330.6399999999999
deal with too and it's good to basically

1329.52 --> 1334.0
have somebody

1330.64 --> 1336.48
deal with that part of you if you have

1334.0 --> 1336.48
that part

1336.559 --> 1339.6789999999999
unresolved things that people just don't

1338.64 --> 1341.6000000000001
have the room

1339.679 --> 1343.44
to resolve on their own just by

1341.6 --> 1345.039
themselves and there's almost nobody

1343.44 --> 1348.72
dealing with that sort of thing

1345.039 --> 1351.679
psychological things and all that right

1348.72 --> 1352.32
and i know that most of you are not

1351.679 --> 1354.72
really

1352.32 --> 1356.24
rich you're not like people that were

1354.72 --> 1359.2
super greedy

1356.24 --> 1360.96
grabbed grabbled anything they could had

1359.2 --> 1363.039
a giant pile of money and now they have

1360.96 --> 1364.48
to deal with all their dissatisfaction

1363.039 --> 1366.96
and their delusions

1364.48 --> 1368.4
like a lot of these ballers out there

1366.96 --> 1371.679
ball supporters ball

1368.4 --> 1372.5590000000002
streamer supporters right you are not

1371.679 --> 1374.4
like that so

1372.559 --> 1377.2
you probably don't have an excessive

1374.4 --> 1380.24
amount of money to throw around

1377.2 --> 1384.4
but yeah at the same time i i lit

1380.24 --> 1387.76
i'm not i can't live

1384.4 --> 1390.24
on a beggar's wage

1387.76 --> 1390.8799999999999
i can't survive that i really do need

1390.24 --> 1394.4
support

1390.88 --> 1397.0390000000002
so if you appreciate me doing what i do

1394.4 --> 1399.52
also i guess as a social and potentially

1397.039 --> 1401.2
diplomatic role

1399.52 --> 1402.799
for whatever that's worth between

1401.2 --> 1405.919
ballers and flat earthers

1402.799 --> 1408.6399999999999
then i please urge you to support me

1405.919 --> 1408.64
financially

1410.799 --> 1418.799
hey professor bell phil belly what

1415.28 --> 1431.84
you sent me a paypal did you

1418.799 --> 1431.84
okay i'll check it out

1441.44 --> 1446.88
ah yes it's pending

1454.64 --> 1463.3600000000001
what's out audi

1459.84 --> 1465.6
all right well thank you

1463.36 --> 1465.6
okay

1470.84 --> 1473.84
right

1475.84 --> 1479.039
yeah thank you very much

1482.48 --> 1487.679
every little bit helps i really

1485.279 --> 1501.84
appreciate that

1487.679 --> 1501.8400000000001
that you would do that even as a baller

1504.24 --> 1508.799
at least the dutch welfare system is far

1506.559 --> 1511.44
better than the uk

1508.799 --> 1512.08
could be i don't know what it's like in

1511.44 --> 1515.8400000000001
the uk

1512.08 --> 1515.84
among patrol

1516.96 --> 1521.3600000000001
like my main biggest priority has always

1520.32 --> 1523.2
been

1521.36 --> 1524.3999999999999
to ensure that they kind of just leave

1523.2 --> 1528.24
me alone i

1524.4 --> 1530.0800000000002
i just i require the minimum

1528.24 --> 1531.76
and i just need them to kind of leave me

1530.08 --> 1535.279
alone because it's really

1531.76 --> 1537.44
unnerving to be in that system and then

1535.279 --> 1538.96
there them constantly trying to peer

1537.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
pressure and

1538.96 --> 1543.8400000000001
push you into getting really shitty jobs

1544.08 --> 1549.1999999999998
that will absolutely break me apart

1546.64 --> 1549.2
mentally

1549.919 --> 1552.159
you know

1554.64 --> 1558.72
and there have been supposed trade

1557.2 --> 1562.96
trajectories

1558.72 --> 1565.52
that have been offered to me that would

1562.96 --> 1566.24
help find a job for me that would suit

1565.52 --> 1569.12
right and

1566.24 --> 1571.919
and i would give them all of it i would

1569.12 --> 1574.08
share them my talents

1571.919 --> 1576.159
they would just not get back at me you

1574.08 --> 1579.1999999999998
just hear nothing

1576.159 --> 1582.0800000000002
nothing right

1579.2 --> 1583.1200000000001
so yeah what do you do what do i do

1582.08 --> 1584.8799999999999
right

1583.12 --> 1586.7199999999998
nothing it's like they don't know what

1584.88 --> 1588.5590000000002
to do with me

1586.72 --> 1590.08
and i'm having trouble knowing what to

1588.559 --> 1594.32
do with them

1590.08 --> 1596.8799999999999
so this has been kind of the only place

1594.32 --> 1598.0
on youtube through all that through

1596.88 --> 1600.159
media through social

1598.0 --> 1601.279
media it's been the only place that i

1600.159 --> 1605.7600000000002
have been actually

1601.279 --> 1608.64
well productive and i can do

1605.76 --> 1609.52
what a whole bunch of people out there

1608.64 --> 1611.919
can't do

1609.52 --> 1613.52
a daily show and keep on talking and

1611.919 --> 1617.2
keep

1613.52 --> 1620.4
keep it intellectual and not

1617.2 --> 1621.44
eventually sort to resort to attention

1620.4 --> 1624.8400000000001
grabbing

1621.44 --> 1627.3600000000001
and sloppiness and showing bad character

1624.84 --> 1629.12
traits you know i had yeah it's not that

1627.36 --> 1631.52
i've been perfect

1629.12 --> 1632.2399999999998
i have some rage issues every now and

1631.52 --> 1634.4
then

1632.24 --> 1636.08
yeah that's that is a problem but i

1634.4 --> 1637.679
recognize it as a problem and they're

1636.08 --> 1640.0
not promoting it like oh that's

1637.679 --> 1642.24
something that you should do

1640.0 --> 1642.24
now

1648.48 --> 1652.559
right but it's been kind of a

1652.84 --> 1659.36
hassle staying afloat even with

1655.84 --> 1662.399
social welfare and that is because

1659.36 --> 1665.6
i could probably get more

1662.399 --> 1668.2399999999998
right i know other people that have

1665.6 --> 1671.12
most people that i've ever met that were

1668.24 --> 1672.64
on social welfare of some kind

1671.12 --> 1675.36
they would not take the minimum they

1672.64 --> 1677.3600000000001
would always take on other provisions

1675.36 --> 1679.4399999999998
and things and it would be a whole

1677.36 --> 1682.799
network of financing

1679.44 --> 1684.0800000000002
and with that like things that they

1682.799 --> 1688.1589999999999
would have to do

1684.08 --> 1688.1589999999999
all over the place like it's a whole

1688.399 --> 1694.8799999999999
it's like it's like a whole job just to

1692.48 --> 1696.0
keep that all together and do all the

1694.88 --> 1699.919
checks and everything

1696.0 --> 1702.96
in the hassle it's unbelievable

1699.919 --> 1703.919
right and i just thought like this is

1702.96 --> 1705.679
insane

1703.919 --> 1706.96
it would for me it would be more

1705.679 --> 1709.76
efficient

1706.96 --> 1711.679
to just not have myself stressed out

1709.76 --> 1712.72
from doing all that shitty thing getting

1711.679 --> 1714.88
all these labels

1712.72 --> 1717.2
never getting out of it probably being

1714.88 --> 1718.88
indoctrinated by oh you're a victim all

1717.2 --> 1720.48
that sort of [ __ ] because that also

1718.88 --> 1724.24
happens

1720.48 --> 1728.159
it's very strange how these institutions

1724.24 --> 1730.64
respond to social welfare recipients

1728.159 --> 1732.48
that need extra financial support it's

1730.64 --> 1734.88
freaky

1732.48 --> 1735.52
you wouldn't want to do it it's not it's

1734.88 --> 1738.5590000000002
not

1735.52 --> 1740.8799999999999
convenient as you would think it is it

1738.559 --> 1740.8799999999999
isn't

1741.6 --> 1745.4399999999998
right so for me it just seemed more

1744.159 --> 1748.88
sensible

1745.44 --> 1752.159
if i just take the minimum appeal

1748.88 --> 1754.5590000000002
to my constitutional right which it is

1752.159 --> 1756.3990000000001
so like that minimum it's a

1754.559 --> 1759.76
constitutional right literally

1756.399 --> 1759.76
i know that i learned that

1760.0 --> 1764.48
and it gives a certain level of security

1763.919 --> 1766.88
that

1764.48 --> 1767.76
pretty much no matter what you do except

1766.88 --> 1771.3600000000001
if it's like

1767.76 --> 1775.039
really officially criminal and all that

1771.36 --> 1777.52
yeah you're kind of safe and that also

1775.039 --> 1780.64
secures well your free speech capability

1777.52 --> 1784.799
in this world where free speech

1780.64 --> 1789.44
is being torn apart from all

1784.799 --> 1794.72
from all sides with financial incentives

1789.44 --> 1798.0800000000002
and just straight out attacks

1794.72 --> 1801.3600000000001
and it's doable because i i don't get

1798.08 --> 1804.799
bothered by institutions constantly

1801.36 --> 1805.84
pushing me around i don't stress out as

1804.799 --> 1808.96
much

1805.84 --> 1811.76
and then i don't have as many

1808.96 --> 1813.8400000000001
problems i don't need as many solutions

1811.76 --> 1814.72
for those problems that are stressing me

1813.84 --> 1817.279
out

1814.72 --> 1819.039
and that's cheaper it just turns out to

1817.279 --> 1823.84
be cheaper

1819.039 --> 1823.84
right that's why i'm living like this

1828.0 --> 1835.84
but at the same time because i'm doing

1831.44 --> 1836.3200000000002
this and this flat earth and all that

1835.84 --> 1838.08
and

1836.32 --> 1840.72
even watching a bit of infowars and

1838.08 --> 1845.6789999999999
that's my own problem

1840.72 --> 1845.679
it does provide little stress and thus

1846.08 --> 1850.1589999999999
it costs me more and that's just an

1849.36 --> 1853.9189999999999
unfortunate

1850.159 --> 1856.0
fact and that's i kind of knew that at

1853.919 --> 1858.0
the start and that's why i said

1856.0 --> 1860.88
when i started asking for financial

1858.0 --> 1863.279
support it really is to keep me going

1860.88 --> 1865.1200000000001
because i could probably survive of

1863.279 --> 1867.519
almost nothing

1865.12 --> 1869.5189999999998
that that i get from the government and

1867.519 --> 1871.6
not do this show

1869.519 --> 1873.44
and i could probably survive that but it

1871.6 --> 1875.4399999999998
would be on very similar level

1873.44 --> 1877.039
it is kind of balanced out that way in

1875.44 --> 1879.44
that i am doing this

1877.039 --> 1881.279
but the overall stress levels are on

1879.44 --> 1883.519
average the same as

1881.279 --> 1884.32
when i didn't do this show and just got

1883.519 --> 1888.48
by from my

1884.32 --> 1890.399
social welfare although the pressure was

1888.48 --> 1891.679
a little higher on me back then because

1890.399 --> 1896.399
of the isolation because

1891.679 --> 1898.72
when i do this i am also communicating

1896.399 --> 1899.76
and i have a need for that i have social

1898.72 --> 1902.48
needs

1899.76 --> 1903.36
to connect with people and to

1902.48 --> 1908.64
communicate

1903.36 --> 1908.6399999999999
to share my thoughts and my feelings

1918.84 --> 1921.84
sometimes

1924.159 --> 1926.3990000000001
ah

1927.919 --> 1933.2
okay let's see before i get into all

1930.159 --> 1933.2
these baller comments

1933.279 --> 1937.12
this is monk patrol what are you doing

1934.88 --> 1937.1200000000001
here

1938.72 --> 1949.84
norwegian fell fair best in europe okay

1941.519 --> 1949.84
if you say so

1954.32 --> 1960.799
right if you if you can be a rat the

1956.799 --> 1960.799
dutch welfare system can be profitable

1960.84 --> 1963.84
yes

1964.72 --> 1971.519
but if you're like a really a softy

1968.399 --> 1974.32
weeny type person

1971.519 --> 1974.799
with a conscious yeah that's then it's

1974.32 --> 1978.24
not

1974.799 --> 1981.44
possible like then it's really tough

1978.24 --> 1982.72
and i'm not a weenie but i have a high

1981.44 --> 1986.0
sense of justice

1982.72 --> 1988.08
and that's also tough because i i just

1986.0 --> 1990.24
pick up on things that are happening

1988.08 --> 1991.84
i see what is going on and it's just

1990.24 --> 1993.6
very disconcerting

1991.84 --> 1995.039
sometimes because you know what is going

1993.6 --> 1998.1589999999999
to happen what happens to

1995.039 --> 2001.6
people when they engage

1998.159 --> 2001.6000000000001
what what it does to them

2001.919 --> 2005.8400000000001
to be entangled with the people that run

2004.96 --> 2008.32
that system

2005.84 --> 2008.32
for them

2014.88 --> 2018.0
i learned to connect with people in real

2016.84 --> 2022.6399999999999
life

2018.0 --> 2024.32
yeah well i do

2022.64 --> 2026.0
but it's kind of hard to connect with

2024.32 --> 2027.6
people in real life

2026.0 --> 2029.12
because a lot of people in real life

2027.6 --> 2033.039
around here are

2029.12 --> 2035.76
severely indoctrinated

2033.039 --> 2037.84
and they're not complete [ __ ] like a

2035.76 --> 2041.12
lot of people that are

2037.84 --> 2044.72
around on the internet but they are

2041.12 --> 2048.56
like burdened by indoctrination

2044.72 --> 2050.7200000000003
and when you try to get

2048.56 --> 2052.159
a better unders understanding to get

2050.72 --> 2056.0789999999997
closer

2052.159 --> 2058.48
then yeah that tension comes afloat

2056.079 --> 2060.639
and then it turns out that they just

2058.48 --> 2064.0
don't want to connect that way

2060.639 --> 2065.839
so there's not a lot out there

2064.0 --> 2067.839
that i can really connect with on a

2065.839 --> 2069.919
deeper level you know on the surface i

2067.839 --> 2074.56
can communicate perfectly

2069.919 --> 2076.48
i can be very pleasant i really can

2074.56 --> 2077.839
but if i really want to get to know

2076.48 --> 2080.639
people

2077.839 --> 2084.639
then that's different because a lot of

2080.639 --> 2084.639
people out there they just don't have

2085.44 --> 2091.28
something yeah that makes it

2088.8 --> 2091.9190000000003
worth it to me to really get to know

2091.28 --> 2095.2000000000003
them

2091.919 --> 2097.2799999999997
that's rare and they are out there

2095.2 --> 2098.48
waiting for the right time to bump into

2097.28 --> 2100.1600000000003
me

2098.48 --> 2103.2
that's kind of how i see it it's just

2100.16 --> 2106.64
the weave of destiny

2103.2 --> 2106.64
but it's not a plenty

2107.92 --> 2112.2400000000002
because most people are just under

2110.0 --> 2114.64
attacked or stalled

2112.24 --> 2116.56
by all the propaganda indoctrination

2114.64 --> 2119.68
especially with the kofi the covey

2116.56 --> 2122.7999999999997
hit the psyche

2119.68 --> 2122.7999999999997
really hard

2123.04 --> 2129.2
and people literally are lost

2126.4 --> 2129.52
as to try and make sense of it all they

2129.2 --> 2133.5989999999997
are

2129.52 --> 2136.64
lost in it they don't know

2133.599 --> 2136.6400000000003
where to stand

2137.119 --> 2142.96
because of the chaos the fractal nature

2140.48 --> 2144.72
or even of the chaos

2142.96 --> 2146.64
how many misassumptions how many

2144.72 --> 2149.68
presuppositions everywhere they don't

2146.64 --> 2158.96
know where to stand anymore

2149.68 --> 2162.0
and that is worrisome

2158.96 --> 2164.4
and usually yeah people yeah they don't

2162.0 --> 2165.28
deal with it then they just keep

2164.4 --> 2167.599
sticking to

2165.28 --> 2169.3590000000004
that thing that they were doing on that

2167.599 --> 2172.4
level whatever it may be

2169.359 --> 2176.64
politics or hobby or their work

2172.4 --> 2178.8
technical things studies whatever

2176.64 --> 2180.8799999999997
but they don't know how to deal with

2178.8 --> 2182.8
what's going on in the world

2180.88 --> 2186.32
not really they don't know really where

2182.8 --> 2188.8
to stand

2186.32 --> 2190.32
and a lot of them also just have this

2188.8 --> 2192.7200000000003
terrible habit of just

2190.32 --> 2194.7200000000003
siding with the state no matter what it

2192.72 --> 2201.839
says out of fear

2194.72 --> 2201.839
out of fear

2206.88 --> 2210.96
so yeah it's really cute again how

2209.04 --> 2213.44
certain ballers want to

2210.96 --> 2214.48
just try to be nasty with their comments

2213.44 --> 2217.44
right

2214.48 --> 2220.0
making negative criticism but yeah i

2217.44 --> 2223.2000000000003
just address it

2220.0 --> 2226.8
that's what i do i just address the

2223.2 --> 2229.839
real issue instead of getting

2226.8 --> 2229.8390000000004
annoyed by it right

2231.839 --> 2235.44
because i know what you're trying it's

2233.44 --> 2240.64
not gonna work

2235.44 --> 2244.2400000000002
i have reasons to do what i do

2240.64 --> 2245.52
why because i'm really neurotic about

2244.24 --> 2249.2799999999997
that

2245.52 --> 2251.7599999999998
i never do anything anymore

2249.28 --> 2253.6800000000003
there isn't a reason i used to have a

2251.76 --> 2256.079
lot more spontaneity in me

2253.68 --> 2257.52
especially when i was really young well

2256.079 --> 2261.8390000000004
that turned out to be just

2257.52 --> 2261.839
really catastrophically dangerous

2267.359 --> 2274.56
it's just this world can't handle that

2271.04 --> 2278.56
and neither can i

2274.56 --> 2280.0789999999997
so i just do things very well thought

2278.56 --> 2285.7599999999998
out

2280.079 --> 2288.32
it's not always the most glorious thing

2285.76 --> 2290.96
but it is very well thought out very

2288.32 --> 2290.96
considered

2291.119 --> 2298.0
and even this position that i am in

2294.88 --> 2300.56
is pretty much a consideration it's not

2298.0 --> 2302.079
something like oh my god i'm just making

2300.56 --> 2305.119
up excuses for

2302.079 --> 2305.92
everything for the disasters that have

2305.119 --> 2308.96
led to me

2305.92 --> 2311.76
being in this position no no no no

2308.96 --> 2312.8
i foresaw this coming because of the

2311.76 --> 2316.6400000000003
decisions

2312.8 --> 2317.04
that i had already made like 20 years

2316.64 --> 2320.16
ago

2317.04 --> 2323.839
when i realized what this world is

2320.16 --> 2324.3199999999997
what is really going on and that it will

2323.839 --> 2327.359
not

2324.32 --> 2330.1600000000003
accept my zealous

2327.359 --> 2331.5989999999997
dedication to truth on a personal level

2330.16 --> 2334.64
and with that that

2331.599 --> 2336.96
also you know a lot of people think

2334.64 --> 2338.0
that just because you somebody thinks

2336.96 --> 2340.7200000000003
they know the truth

2338.0 --> 2341.28
and they are proud of it that that means

2340.72 --> 2343.4399999999996
that they

2341.28 --> 2346.2400000000002
are trying to convert everybody no no i

2343.44 --> 2348.56
stopped really doing that

2346.24 --> 2350.4799999999996
you know only people you can convince

2348.56 --> 2354.0789999999997
are the ones that are open that are

2350.48 --> 2356.64
actually not willing to pry you

2354.079 --> 2357.28
to see if they can find some things to

2356.64 --> 2359.359
basically

2357.28 --> 2361.52
judge you with some more but if they're

2359.359 --> 2363.52
really curious for themselves

2361.52 --> 2366.24
those are the only people you can

2363.52 --> 2370.24
actually help

2366.24 --> 2374.0
you can actually wake up help them

2370.24 --> 2376.3199999999997
consider things to see what is

2374.0 --> 2376.32
real

2380.079 --> 2384.48
i lost my train of thought anyway

2390.96 --> 2394.7200000000003
right so if anybody out there watches

2394.24 --> 2398.0
this

and i think what is his name again

2408.839 --> 2413.04
earlier

2410.4 --> 2414.7200000000003
professor phil bell for yeah he did

2413.04 --> 2416.48
actually send me some paypal and i

2414.72 --> 2420.0
really appreciate that that even a

2416.48 --> 2422.48
baller would support me it would be good

2420.0 --> 2425.839
if other people would also support me

2422.48 --> 2425.839
you know

2426.96 --> 2431.599
i i would hope that flat earthers would

2429.04 --> 2431.599
support me

2431.839 --> 2435.839
unless they i don't i wonder sometimes

2435.359 --> 2438.88
do

2435.839 --> 2441.04
flat earthers on average respect me

2438.88 --> 2442.96
look down on me or see me as some kind

2441.04 --> 2446.64
of a threat

2442.96 --> 2446.64
or do they still

2447.119 --> 2452.0
have savage ideas and think that i'm

2450.48 --> 2455.119
some kind of a weird

2452.0 --> 2457.44
controlled opposition agent

2455.119 --> 2458.6400000000003
which i sometimes wonder myself by the

2457.44 --> 2462.2400000000002
way

2458.64 --> 2465.04
but trust me there is no plan

2462.24 --> 2466.0
no thing that i signed or anything i'm

2465.04 --> 2468.64
just doing what

2466.0 --> 2468.64
i'm doing

2469.44 --> 2473.92
i'm not bound by any agenda

2476.88 --> 2483.2000000000003
i'm only bound by the principles that i

2479.92 --> 2483.2000000000003
uphold for myself

2486.079 --> 2495.8390000000004
and of course by natural law

2496.96 --> 2500.88
i give flat earth a bad name voynich

2499.44 --> 2502.64
really do i

2500.88 --> 2504.48
do i give flat earth to bad name can i

2502.64 --> 2509.839
have some comments on that

2504.48 --> 2509.839
from others

2526.64 --> 2533.7599999999998
probably threat i'm too threatening

2530.64 --> 2535.68
is it because i get really insidiously

2533.76 --> 2538.88
angry sometimes

2535.68 --> 2541.839
is that part just too scared

2538.88 --> 2541.839
is it too scary

2546.64 --> 2552.64
i might be

2550.72 --> 2553.839
it's really weird to me because i've met

2552.64 --> 2557.92
other people that

2553.839 --> 2560.16
had similar intention intense

2557.92 --> 2561.119
levels of anger in them very similar

2560.16 --> 2562.56
ways

2561.119 --> 2565.92
and i never thought they were

2562.56 --> 2568.64
threatening because it's just

2565.92 --> 2568.64
it's pain

2569.04 --> 2573.44
it's pain that's that's why it's so

2572.48 --> 2577.119
intense

2573.44 --> 2577.119
because the pain is just intense

2577.599 --> 2584.0
now i'm very lucky to have a built up a

2580.96 --> 2587.359
very strong discipline to never

2584.0 --> 2590.319
let that rage damage anything

2587.359 --> 2591.44
like physically right although i do i

2590.319 --> 2594.88
guess

2591.44 --> 2597.599
i scare some people sometimes with it

2594.88 --> 2598.96
and i regret that i wish that wouldn't

2597.599 --> 2603.52
be the case

2598.96 --> 2606.56
and i really tried to not get as loud

2603.52 --> 2607.92
right but it never scares me when other

2606.56 --> 2611.68
people do that

2607.92 --> 2611.6800000000003
because i totally get what that is

2612.72 --> 2616.8799999999997
like i can listen if somebody is getting

2614.96 --> 2619.359
really loud and pissed off i can

2616.88 --> 2620.0
listen in to the sound they make and

2619.359 --> 2622.4
then

2620.0 --> 2623.2
figure out what it is they are going

2622.4 --> 2624.88
through

2623.2 --> 2627.4399999999996
and what will be the consequence it's

2624.88 --> 2629.359
like the sound of somebody just being

2627.44 --> 2630.88
really pissed off and yelling their

2629.359 --> 2633.5989999999997
frustration out

2630.88 --> 2635.52
or even like cursing at something really

2633.599 --> 2639.04
like want to destroy

2635.52 --> 2641.68
a thing that sort of anger it sounds

2639.04 --> 2643.04
very different to somebody actually

2641.68 --> 2646.16
wanting to basically

2643.04 --> 2647.04
dominate and brutalize somebody else it

2646.16 --> 2649.839
sounds

2647.04 --> 2649.839
very different

2650.48 --> 2655.04
different tension different type of

2652.56 --> 2658.16
frequencies

2655.04 --> 2661.119
and i guess that other people just

2658.16 --> 2662.24
they don't have that some people don't

2661.119 --> 2666.48
they can't distinguish

2662.24 --> 2676.7999999999997
from it so it just gets scared every

2666.48 --> 2677.65
time somebody gets really loud

2676.8 --> 2681.51
right

2677.65 --> 2681.51
[Music]

2684.079 --> 2687.3590000000004
come on do people learn some talent what

2686.079 --> 2692.319
are you talking about

2687.359 --> 2696.56
emin what are you talking about

2692.319 --> 2701.2799999999997
i do i do talk with people

2696.56 --> 2704.72
i help people all the time i'm very

2701.28 --> 2706.6400000000003
gallant i help people all the time

2704.72 --> 2708.7999999999997
whenever i see the opportunity because i

2706.64 --> 2711.1189999999997
like doing it

2708.8 --> 2712.48
i like being nice to people because it

2711.119 --> 2719.839
makes them happy

2712.48 --> 2719.839
when they're happy that makes me happy

2729.44 --> 2732.8
at the end no out there in the real

2732.24 --> 2735.9199999999996
world

2732.8 --> 2737.92
you know i go out every day mn

2735.92 --> 2739.52
i'm not just stuck here in this box just

2737.92 --> 2740.64
because that's the way the camera

2739.52 --> 2743.839
reveals it

2740.64 --> 2746.7999999999997
right out there

2743.839 --> 2750.0389999999998
all the time

2746.8 --> 2750.039
[Music]

2751.92 --> 2759.04
like for it's just a basic example

2754.96 --> 2761.359
but like the roommate that is moving out

2759.04 --> 2763.839
i helped them move didn't have to do

2761.359 --> 2767.5989999999997
that i just offered to do that

2763.839 --> 2770.7999999999997
and i did it did a lot of it

2767.599 --> 2774.1600000000003
i was happy to do it and they were happy

2770.8 --> 2778.319
that i helped they were very thankful

2774.16 --> 2778.319
right so it's a win-win situation

2782.4 --> 2787.359
that's just what you do it's not because

2784.72 --> 2789.2
you have to it's because

2787.359 --> 2791.04
i want to i just saw the opportunity

2789.2 --> 2803.839
thought like yeah

2791.04 --> 2803.839
let's let's help out

2804.319 --> 2808.4
is that so unimaginable mn

2814.24 --> 2818.64
or maybe you're just projecting maybe

2816.4 --> 2821.76
you're just really telling yourself and

2818.64 --> 2822.56
you you're not realizing it and you come

2821.76 --> 2826.1600000000003
out to people

2822.56 --> 2826.16
and there are some tolerance and social

2828.839 --> 2831.839
skills

2843.52 --> 2850.0
right well monk patrol yeah

2847.119 --> 2851.2000000000003
well there is some toxicity you know

2850.0 --> 2853.839
people

2851.2 --> 2855.839
that are in key positions which they

2853.839 --> 2857.599
have worked for very hard

2855.839 --> 2860.72
not it's not been handed to them they

2857.599 --> 2863.3590000000004
worked for it right like qe and nathan

2860.72 --> 2864.64
yeah they have some toxic responses

2863.359 --> 2866.64
guess why that is

2864.64 --> 2867.92
because they're constantly being

2866.64 --> 2870.96
bombarded by

2867.92 --> 2874.079
it from you guys

2870.96 --> 2876.0
yeah that's what happens

2874.079 --> 2878.8
get a little toxic because that's what

2876.0 --> 2878.8
you're inserting

2879.68 --> 2884.5589999999997
right now i sometimes get a little

2882.72 --> 2888.319
bothered by it as well

2884.559 --> 2890.559
to be fair especially kiwi yeah john

2888.319 --> 2892.319
i really love your ball buster show i'm

2890.559 --> 2895.599
very happy

2892.319 --> 2896.16
that i'm welcome to be a regular panel

2895.599 --> 2898.88
mambo

2896.16 --> 2903.04
member and i really like the ball

2898.88 --> 2905.599
busters and kiwi live shows i really do

2903.04 --> 2906.48
and i will get on the ball buster show

2905.599 --> 2909.839
this evening

2906.48 --> 2914.559
you know why because john

2909.839 --> 2917.599
is very composed when he does his show

2914.559 --> 2920.6400000000003
it's very serious and very restrained

2917.599 --> 2922.559
but yeah when he gets on the flat earth

2920.64 --> 2925.92
debate sometimes then he can be just a

2922.559 --> 2928.2400000000002
major nuisance like he

2925.92 --> 2929.44
rapidly it has sometimes he's in the

2928.24 --> 2933.2
mood and it then just

2929.44 --> 2936.0
rapidly descends into just

2933.2 --> 2937.5989999999997
a pure at-home [ __ ] and then it goes bad

2936.0 --> 2940.559
it ruins the situation it's very

2937.599 --> 2942.88
annoying john when you do that

2940.559 --> 2944.079
if it's better to basically not get in

2942.88 --> 2947.28
there because you

2944.079 --> 2950.559
yeah you effectively ruin

2947.28 --> 2953.52
the hangout when you do that

2950.559 --> 2953.52
it's not really good

2953.76 --> 2960.559
right but yeah at the same time he is

2958.319 --> 2962.8
in a position where he has brought a lot

2960.559 --> 2966.4
of very important

2962.8 --> 2969.92
information and realization to the table

2966.4 --> 2971.359
and he is being isolated and attacked

2969.92 --> 2974.2400000000002
from all sides

2971.359 --> 2976.96
from ballers that just absolutely

2974.24 --> 2980.0789999999997
despise him i bet he gets like

2976.96 --> 2981.44
really terrible threats and [ __ ] via the

2980.079 --> 2984.88
internet sometimes

2981.44 --> 2986.079
i bet he does people that are trying to

2984.88 --> 2989.2000000000003
unroot him and just

2986.079 --> 2992.96
get him just arrested or something for

2989.2 --> 2996.0
complete garbage i bet he does

2992.96 --> 2998.7200000000003
right so yeah

2996.0 --> 2999.839
yeah you know when you get

2998.72 --> 3002.319
psychologically

2999.839 --> 3003.52
attacked and threatened and shed over

3002.319 --> 3006.24
and

3003.52 --> 3007.68
just rumors about you constantly

3006.24 --> 3009.839
constantly peeping

3007.68 --> 3011.04
people [ __ ] over you for no damn

3009.839 --> 3013.68
reason

3011.04 --> 3014.72
just whining about your behavior all day

3013.68 --> 3018.96
long yeah

3014.72 --> 3020.5589999999997
that's toxic yeah now you can compose

3018.96 --> 3023.28
yourself in the face of it

3020.559 --> 3025.28
but that toxicity is still there it's

3023.28 --> 3029.0400000000004
still disgusting it's still

3025.28 --> 3032.3190000000004
unnerving as in stressful

3029.04 --> 3034.16
and then yeah at some point

3032.319 --> 3035.839
it's gonna burst you're gonna get pissed

3034.16 --> 3039.5989999999997
off that's what happens

3035.839 --> 3042.5589999999997
that's what happens yeah that's not

3039.599 --> 3043.52
their fault it's because of what you

3042.559 --> 3048.559
guys out there

3043.52 --> 3048.559
do to him to them and to me

3051.44 --> 3057.68

went

3161.52 --> 3166.559
up against the baller in the show in any

3164.839 --> 3168.64
form

3166.559 --> 3170.48
except for in the flat earth debates but

3168.64 --> 3171.44
i would never have the full ground for

3170.48 --> 3173.599
it

3171.44 --> 3176.4
just a bite here and there a couple of

3173.599 --> 3181.839
remarks so i'd love to hear about

3176.4 --> 3181.839

otherwise i would yeah it inform you

3232.48 --> 3235.04
that

3233.119 --> 3237.76
flat earthers are actually not

3235.04 --> 3240.4
uneducated

3237.76 --> 3242.1600000000003
that's the whole issue flat earthers are

3240.4 --> 3244.8
flat earthers because they are

3242.16 --> 3244.7999999999997
educated

3245.92 --> 3253.04
and they don't conform and

3249.359 --> 3253.04
overlook mistakes

3254.079 --> 3265.8390000000004
we just build our own data

3257.44 --> 3265.839
we we put it together from all sides

3290.839 --> 3293.839
cool

3300.24 --> 3310.72

3307.04 --> 3312.88
i had an education yeah i know it told

3310.72 --> 3315.839
me the earth was a globe

3312.88 --> 3316.6400000000003
but then eventually i figured out that

3315.839 --> 3319.44
it's just

3316.64 --> 3320.0
a bunch of math and presuppositions

3319.44 --> 3323.52
figured it

3320.0 --> 3334.72
out oh

3323.52 --> 3336.96
okay m thanks i'll check it out

3334.72 --> 3336.9599999999996

3352.079 --> 3363.8390000000004
where is it

3364.079 --> 3367.52
huh where did that come from

3369.44 --> 3375.04
all right yeah yeah yeah i got it yeah i

3372.559 --> 3378.559
think yeah now i understand

3375.04 --> 3381.599
yeah thank you thank you very much m

3378.559 --> 3383.0400000000004
for the i'll not take it you don't want

3381.599 --> 3386.1600000000003
to have your name

3383.04 --> 3388.5589999999997
read out but thank you very much for the

3386.16 --> 3392.3999999999996
support

3388.559 --> 3394.96
that will help at least one day i will

3392.4 --> 3399.6800000000003
have some extra

3394.96 --> 3399.68
so that i can then yeah survive that day

3401.28 --> 3409.44
so yeah it's it's a start i

3404.48 --> 3409.44
i do need more though i'm very sorry

3409.92 --> 3416.48
so if anybody else could also miss

3413.44 --> 3419.52
a couple of bucks it would be really

3416.48 --> 3433.839
really helpful

3419.52 --> 3433.839
but i thank you m for supporting me

3446.48 --> 3454.0
do we not get to keep the super chat

3450.0 --> 3456.0
uh no not really it takes forever before

3454.0 --> 3458.839
i eventually get anything of it

3456.0 --> 3460.559
because it only goes on the monthly

3458.839 --> 3463.68
basis

3460.559 --> 3466.079
and yeah most of it is taken out so i

3463.68 --> 3468.7
effectively don't get anything

3466.079 --> 3470.079
at this moment right

3468.7 --> 3473.7599999999998
[Music]

3470.079 --> 3476.4
with my current setup i'm sorry

3473.76 --> 3478.079
if you don't like it you could also

3476.4 --> 3480.1600000000003
subscribe to my patreon

3478.079 --> 3482.6400000000003
i do have a patreon i don't really talk

3480.16 --> 3485.2
about it that often

3482.64 --> 3487.44
i got a couple of supporters in there

3485.2 --> 3490.799
and i really do appreciate it it is like

3487.44 --> 3490.799
this monthly extra

3491.2 --> 3495.04
so if you don't like paypal then you can

3493.2 --> 3498.319
always yeah

3495.04 --> 3500.24
donate through that system

3498.319 --> 3502.079
but it does take longer though it's not

3500.24 --> 3505.1189999999997
as quick paypal is just very

3502.079 --> 3508.559
quick and i kind of need it

3505.119 --> 3513.119
on very short term so but

3508.559 --> 3513.119
yeah thank you for considering a real

3514.839 --> 3517.839
joe

3520.799 --> 3524.24
and by the way if you have it available

3522.96 --> 3527.28
yeah i i do take

3524.24 --> 3530.8799999999997
crypto as well and i

3527.28 --> 3533.28
i can yeah tran transform that pretty

3530.88 --> 3533.28
quickly

3534.72 --> 3540.8799999999997
takes a little bit more work but i can

3538.24 --> 3543.359
also yeah transform that into money that

3540.88 --> 3546.079
i can actually use as well

3543.359 --> 3550.319
quicker than i can with patreon and

3546.079 --> 3550.319
super chat donations whatever is left of

3556.839 --> 3559.839
that

3570.839 --> 3573.839
so

3574.64 --> 3578.0789999999997
wow well johnny system it seems like you

3577.359 --> 3579.839
have not

3578.079 --> 3582.799
actually checked out a lot of flat

3579.839 --> 3584.88
earthers now i'm

3582.799 --> 3586.4
me and my channel i'm not much of a math

3584.88 --> 3590.88
guy

3586.4 --> 3590.88
i am however a lot about facts though

3591.119 --> 3597.6800000000003
picking up on things that are out there

3594.48 --> 3601.68
like for example the orbit of mercury

3597.68 --> 3604.3999999999996
not fitting in any kind of

3601.68 --> 3605.5989999999997
model that is currently present like

3604.4 --> 3607.76
when they worked out

3605.599 --> 3608.6400000000003
the gravitation based on newton

3607.76 --> 3610.559
mechanics

3608.64 --> 3612.16
like even though newton didn't claim

3610.559 --> 3615.599
hypothesis

3612.16 --> 3618.48
when they calculated the solar system

3615.599 --> 3619.839
with the gravity right there's they had

3618.48 --> 3622.88
a little problem

3619.839 --> 3626.319
because mercury didn't

3622.88 --> 3630.079
fit in the model they couldn't

3626.319 --> 3632.799
get it to work

3630.079 --> 3634.079
and they never got it to work right that

3632.799 --> 3638.24
problem has been

3634.079 --> 3640.88
out there for at least 100 years it

3638.24 --> 3643.04
probably more

3640.88 --> 3646.079
and it just can't be fit now there's

3643.04 --> 3648.96
some people saying oh but einstein

3646.079 --> 3651.8390000000004
einstein's model accounts for that it's

3648.96 --> 3654.079
just einsteinian for some reason

3651.839 --> 3655.359
and the rest is newton well that doesn't

3654.079 --> 3659.2000000000003
make any sense because

3655.359 --> 3662.24
einstein's model can't actually

3659.2 --> 3666.96
calculate the solar system setup

3662.24 --> 3670.8799999999997
at all it can only calculate one

3666.96 --> 3673.839
body of attraction at a time

3670.88 --> 3675.52
right so that means that mercury is

3673.839 --> 3678.319
simply yeah we see it

3675.52 --> 3679.839
it's going this apparent circle and all

3678.319 --> 3683.119
that in the heavens

3679.839 --> 3686.24
but they can't get it to

3683.119 --> 3688.48
fit in the solar system with

3686.24 --> 3689.4399999999996
gravity mechanics they can't get it to

3688.48 --> 3693.52
fit

3689.44 --> 3696.64
right so yeah facts you facts you say

3693.52 --> 3698.799
well there's a fact for you

3696.64 --> 3700.8799999999997
yeah yeah i am for real why don't you

3698.799 --> 3704.319
look it up johnny system

3700.88 --> 3706.559
why didn't you look it up yeah

3704.319 --> 3707.599
it's very funny isn't it when i do

3706.559 --> 3709.599
actually

3707.599 --> 3710.799
shove a fact in your face after you say

3709.599 --> 3715.92
we don't have any

3710.799 --> 3718.96
yeah that one is a fact yeah

3715.92 --> 3719.28
no no it's not a weird orbit the thing

3718.96 --> 3722.799
is

3719.28 --> 3724.7200000000003
orbits are supposedly orbits because of

3722.799 --> 3728.0
certain mechanics based on

3724.72 --> 3731.4399999999996
gravity right as it is calculated well

3728.0 --> 3734.88
you can't calculate

3731.44 --> 3738.079
why mercury is in this

3734.88 --> 3740.48
pattern the way it is in the model that

3738.079 --> 3743.599
you use to calculate everything

3740.48 --> 3746.88
right so it's not just

3743.599 --> 3749.52
a weird orbit no it's not an orbit

3746.88 --> 3751.52
it doesn't work you can't even call it

3749.52 --> 3755.28
an orbit because you can't apply

3751.52 --> 3757.7599999999998
orbital mechanics to it you see

3755.28 --> 3758.799
you see it's a really serious problem

3757.76 --> 3762.1600000000003
it's not just a

3758.799 --> 3764.96
in discrepancy no it's a gap

3762.16 --> 3767.2
it's a planet-sized gap in the entire

3764.96 --> 3769.44
calculation

3767.2 --> 3771.2799999999997
right which is what it is it's all

3769.44 --> 3773.119
calculatory

3771.28 --> 3775.28
there's nothing actually out there it's

3773.119 --> 3778.2400000000002
only lights

3775.28 --> 3780.079
with certain angular patterns in

3778.24 --> 3781.4399999999996
relation to the observers on the earth

3780.079 --> 3783.039
right

3781.44 --> 3784.96
and then you calculate with based on

3783.039 --> 3786.6400000000003
presuppositions that they're all balls

3784.96 --> 3787.599
out there at a certain distance in

3786.64 --> 3791.359
certain

3787.599 --> 3794.4
orbital patterns right yeah but mercury

3791.359 --> 3798.0
can't be made to fit

3794.4 --> 3800.7200000000003
in that pattern when calculated

3798.0 --> 3802.16
right everything else can be yeah it

3800.72 --> 3804.0789999999997
fits it fits in the

3802.16 --> 3805.359
in the gravity model the newtonian

3804.079 --> 3808.7200000000003
gravity model

3805.359 --> 3811.68
but not that one it's still there though

3808.72 --> 3812.24
it's still there yeah that light's still

3811.68 --> 3815.0389999999998
there

3812.24 --> 3815.52
it doesn't fit in the model though at

3815.039 --> 3819.6800000000003
all

3815.52 --> 3822.72
you can't make it fit which means

3819.68 --> 3825.1189999999997
the model is completely broken because

3822.72 --> 3829.0389999999998
it is there

3825.119 --> 3831.2000000000003
the model is broken it doesn't work

3829.039 --> 3832.2400000000002
yeah it's not an indiscreptency it's a

3831.2 --> 3835.52
major

3832.24 --> 3837.2799999999997
fundamental gap that is not being

3835.52 --> 3840.799
addressed

3837.28 --> 3846.0
because it's broken you see this is

3840.799 --> 3849.119
fact this is historical fact

3846.0 --> 3851.52
so yeah you show me the map oh now

3849.119 --> 3853.28
i have to now i have to do it everything

3851.52 --> 3856.16
like a computer i have to

3853.28 --> 3858.3190000000004
just instantly put down every [ __ ]

3856.16 --> 3859.5989999999997
little detail that was ever talked about

3858.319 --> 3862.88
every calculation

3859.599 --> 3866.0
ever made in order to support that

3862.88 --> 3868.799
historical fact that you if you

3866.0 --> 3870.16
care to can look up for yourself and

3868.799 --> 3872.72
then find out how

3870.16 --> 3873.5989999999997
other people that have attempted to

3872.72 --> 3875.68
figure it out

3873.599 --> 3876.799
do confirm that this is actually the

3875.68 --> 3880.0
case

3876.799 --> 3883.839
right so yeah i'm not here

3880.0 --> 3886.64
to barf out the entire preponderance

3883.839 --> 3888.24
of pseudoscience for you i can just

3886.64 --> 3891.839
point out something

3888.24 --> 3896.64
that is a known fact and then you

3891.839 --> 3900.48
you can look into it how about that

3896.64 --> 3902.24
huh right so i'm gonna round out the

3900.48 --> 3904.64
show

3902.24 --> 3906.319
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

3904.64 --> 3910.319
liked the show

3906.319 --> 3913.359
i thought it was good i did a little uh

3910.319 --> 3916.0
little begging for more money but i need

3913.359 --> 3918.72
it i really do need it

3916.0 --> 3919.039
i'm just trying to stay afloat here i'm

3918.72 --> 3921.68
not

3919.039 --> 3922.48
hoarding some giant pile of money i

3921.68 --> 3925.0389999999998
really

3922.48 --> 3926.799
just am trying to get about so please do
