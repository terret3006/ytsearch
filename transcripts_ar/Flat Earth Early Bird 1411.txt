uh I don't know

99.12 --> 102.72
[Music]

100.439 --> 105.53999999999999
it was actually kind of cloudy but now

102.72 --> 109.28
literally now I'm looking outside and

105.54 --> 109.28
suddenly I do actually see a bit of blue

110.159 --> 115.64
but yeah it's overall been kind of a

112.619 --> 115.64
gray day

115.74 --> 121.86
no rain but just cloudy and with the

118.979 --> 124.02
wind and kind of grimish looking oh look

121.86 --> 126.74
the Buddhist monks are walking doing

124.02 --> 126.74
their walk again

127.58 --> 132.5
but anyway

129.599 --> 132.5
yeah the weather

133.68 --> 139.64000000000001
it's just

135.84 --> 139.64000000000001
Autumn getting close to Winter

146.099 --> 153.29999999999998
hello iron 26 first in chat monster

149.76 --> 159.78
Salim good to see you

153.3 --> 159.78
it is Thursday the 3rd of November 2022

164.4 --> 167.48000000000002
it's been interesting

168.48 --> 173.22
I did not go on the Flat Earth debates

170.7 --> 176.64
yesterday

173.22 --> 179.76
because I yeah I was a bit Tapped Out

176.64 --> 181.2
I spent a lot of energy in that show I

179.76 --> 183.599
did

181.2 --> 186.66
I mean those that have watched my actual

183.599 --> 190.44
show know that like yeah that that's our

186.66 --> 192.35999999999999
win fired out and uh

190.44 --> 195.72
well

192.36 --> 198.42000000000002
I went out for groceries very quickly

195.72 --> 201.84
after just saying hello in the live chat

198.42 --> 203.16
once that's it but then I did actually

201.84 --> 204.659
listen afterward

203.16 --> 208.44
[Music]

204.659 --> 212.28
and then later uh also

208.44 --> 215.159
watched back through the members only uh

212.28 --> 218.519
upload the rest of it

215.159 --> 220.98
and yeah I was actually uh

218.519 --> 223.5
kind of surprised

220.98 --> 226.14
but pleasantly so

223.5 --> 228.54
for the most part

226.14 --> 232.379
right because yeah apparently that whole

228.54 --> 234.72
show just was about me pretty much

232.379 --> 238.67999999999998
didn't expect them to go that far but

234.72 --> 240.9
yeah but the best thing about it all

238.68 --> 244.26000000000002
that really did Stand Out is that Nathan

240.9 --> 248.459
just apparently took my message serious

244.26 --> 250.92
and he has proven to me

248.459 --> 253.799
beyond the shadow of a doubt that he

250.92 --> 257.03999999999996
absolutely got my point like the

253.799 --> 260.34000000000003
entirety of it and even the reason why I

257.04 --> 264.18
did that and why I was so upset and that

260.34 --> 265.56
is really well gratifying

264.18 --> 268.979
and

265.56 --> 274.139
definitely restored the alleged 40

268.979 --> 275.75899999999996
confidence loss back to a 400 percent

274.139 --> 277.919
so

275.759 --> 281.04
yeah

277.919 --> 284.58
tenth was so or not yes I know I mean

281.04 --> 286.259
even for 10th man that was that was a

284.58 --> 288.78
little far

286.259 --> 291.91900000000004
I can't believe that it would just be so

288.78 --> 291.919
incredibly pushy

291.96 --> 296.75899999999996
like almost like it was politically

293.88 --> 299.34
inclined not to let me have any kind of

296.759 --> 304.259
win about anything

299.34 --> 306.0
it's really gross 10 it's really gross

304.259 --> 309.139
well pretty sure you don't actually

306.0 --> 309.139
watch my streams

309.6 --> 313.46000000000004
so yeah whatever

313.62 --> 317.3
but uh yeah I mean

317.94 --> 324.24
he really thinks tenth he really thinks

321.24 --> 325.74
that he's somehow doing the right thing

324.24 --> 328.68
but

325.74 --> 331.86
I don't know if he even realizes like

328.68 --> 334.699
what how other people are seeing the

331.86 --> 334.699
entire situation

334.919 --> 337.639
for real

342.78 --> 352.4
some what low P2 Cru shank and hello

346.56 --> 352.4
slo-mo moon buggy Amanda Jung Len Lennox

354.18 --> 359.039
wow Chad's gotten busy

366.3 --> 371.84000000000003
pennies oh okay

369.12 --> 371.84000000000003
right

374.699 --> 380.639
anyway yeah it was overall kind of

377.759 --> 383.24
intense and

380.639 --> 383.24
but

383.419 --> 389.29999999999995
I just had to have a relatively well

386.52 --> 389.29999999999995
rested day

396.6 --> 402.78000000000003
so I kind of needed a break anyway

399.96 --> 406.19899999999996
but yeah I will get back on the Flat

402.78 --> 409.94
Earth debates today and

406.199 --> 409.94
hopefully no more

412.44 --> 418.02
no more annoying situation it might be

414.96 --> 420.35999999999996
just very passive

418.02 --> 425.58
right but one thing that I do know is

420.36 --> 426.6
that if 10th Man or Adam get the idea in

425.58 --> 429.3
their head

426.6 --> 432.24
that they should publicly confront me

429.3 --> 435.12
for my bad behavior supposedly

432.24 --> 439.039
I'm immediately gonna Bolt

435.12 --> 443.46
I'll have none of that

439.039 --> 447.479
absolutely ridiculous yeah it's not a

443.46 --> 451.31899999999996
thing it's not a thing in fed that

447.479 --> 453.36
everybody gets to shame our win because

451.319 --> 456.18
of his code of conduct

453.36 --> 458.58000000000004
that's just not gonna happen that's if

456.18 --> 462.18
that is something that any of you insist

458.58 --> 464.94
then I will leave

462.18 --> 467.12
you understand

464.94 --> 467.12
foreign

467.639 --> 470.639
anyway

471.78 --> 476.75899999999996
and yeah you can call me a dick if you

475.68 --> 480.0
want

476.759 --> 481.91900000000004
when I am offended oh yeah I'm a

480.0 --> 484.08
freaking dick you better damn well

481.919 --> 487.31899999999996
believe it yeah it's called deterrent

484.08 --> 489.8
deterrent for you not acting like a dick

487.319 --> 489.8
to me

490.139 --> 495.199
yeah act like a dick to me and act like

493.5 --> 499.02
a dick right back

495.199 --> 501.24
and I kind of take it as group Behavior

499.02 --> 504.29999999999995
so yeah I mean

501.24 --> 506.699
when Adam bumped into me in chat

504.3 --> 508.68
somewhere what I don't even remember how

506.699 --> 511.319
it was he didn't know anything about it

508.68 --> 514.62
he was totally outside of it

511.319 --> 516.599
and yeah I did act out on you because I

514.62 --> 519.599
was basically in the middle of being

516.599 --> 522.6800000000001
really really pissed off and you'll just

519.599 --> 526.44
have to excuse me when I'm like that

522.68 --> 529.26
for having a very unpleasant and

526.44 --> 531.6600000000001
potentially patronizing tone because

529.26 --> 533.76
that's what happened when I'm really

531.66 --> 536.88
freaking pissed off

533.76 --> 540.0
you're gonna have to excuse me for that

536.88 --> 541.14
if you don't then you cannot be my

540.0 --> 543.779
friend

541.14 --> 547.019
yeah not because I choose you not to

543.779 --> 548.58
have me not to have you as my friend but

547.019 --> 551.04
because you can't handle me because

548.58 --> 553.5600000000001
that's just how I work you're gonna have

551.04 --> 555.5999999999999
to learn to deal with that

553.56 --> 558.899
because I don't know any other way to do

555.6 --> 562.14
it yeah I'm not gonna like go break down

558.899 --> 565.08
and crying just because I don't want to

562.14 --> 567.54
be mean yeah

565.08 --> 569.88
I'm not a little kid anymore and I will

567.54 --> 572.88
not be treated as such

569.88 --> 575.22
and Adam can call me young man as much

572.88 --> 576.06
as he likes it's really amusing and all

575.22 --> 578.339
that

576.06 --> 580.68
but uh yeah

578.339 --> 584.519
other than just a

580.68 --> 588.3599999999999
a figure of speech I do not accept any

584.519 --> 591.08
role designation like that yeah

588.36 --> 591.08
for the record

595.92 --> 600.3
yeah Adam made my case but he also had

598.26 --> 603.54
to mention that it was a dick

600.3 --> 604.8599999999999
fair enough I mean I wasn't it was

603.54 --> 607.86
overall good

604.86 --> 608.94
and I'm but I'm especially impressed by

607.86 --> 610.6800000000001
Nathan

608.94 --> 612.5400000000001
because I had really thought that he

610.68 --> 615.06
kind of just like

612.54 --> 617.8199999999999
kind of nudged off fell asleep because

615.06 --> 620.3599999999999
of a lack of opposition and the computer

617.82 --> 623.4590000000001
troubles which is not exactly riveting

620.36 --> 625.14
for him on either I mean he'll be

623.459 --> 628.0799999999999
focused on it but it doesn't actually

625.14 --> 630.6
help you be a better flattered debater

628.08 --> 632.22
uh

630.6 --> 635.76
yeah

632.22 --> 638.64
but he really proved throughout the

635.76 --> 641.519
entire show yesterday that Nathan

638.64 --> 643.74
literally got my entire position from

641.519 --> 648.66
beginning to end and the entire reason

643.74 --> 653.16
and motivation for why I did what I did

648.66 --> 655.56
and Adam had a long way as well but I

653.16 --> 657.899
really felt Nathan completely got it

655.56 --> 659.9399999999999
like completely and that is impressive

657.899 --> 663.62
to me

659.94 --> 663.62
so yeah I thank you

666.36 --> 669.899
what

667.82 --> 672.9200000000001
what are you talking about pizza

669.899 --> 672.92
cruciating what

673.019 --> 677.899
yeah

674.399 --> 677.899
I don't know why I don't want to know

678.06 --> 681.54
what

679.62 --> 684.26
I'm come

681.54 --> 684.26
who's that

684.3 --> 690.1999999999999
oh by the way PJ cruising thank you for

686.399 --> 690.2
the PayPal donation I almost forgot to

690.42 --> 693.66
to say

692.04 --> 696.5999999999999
an actor

693.66 --> 697.68
wait there's a lot of different Imran

696.6 --> 699.839
Kongs

697.68 --> 703.079
a cricketer

699.839 --> 706.4590000000001
a Pakistani Dutch songwriter and an

703.079 --> 706.459
American actor which one

708.959 --> 715.04
cricketer what he got shot

712.14 --> 715.04
what the [ __ ]

724.14 --> 730.1
okay

725.76 --> 730.1
doesn't seem to have hit the news yet

732.959 --> 738.899
there's nothing in the Google results is

736.62 --> 741.019
this literally just in this second or

738.899 --> 741.019
something

742.8 --> 749.399
former VM oh

746.7 --> 753.86
or did you misspell it because the

749.399 --> 753.86
search result did not yield a lot

754.38 --> 759.6
okay so he was ex-politician

757.56 --> 762.5999999999999
foreign

759.6 --> 762.6
leg

762.66 --> 767.76
all right so no fatal shooting

765.959 --> 772.079
okay

767.76 --> 774.92
okay thanks for the info I guess

772.079 --> 774.92
uh

783.12 --> 785.54
all right

794.579 --> 798.54
anyway I mean

797.09 --> 800.94
[Music]

798.54 --> 803.579
the response from the Flat Earth debate

800.94 --> 806.7600000000001
was so complete it's almost like it's

803.579 --> 808.56
just it's done like I I barely have

806.76 --> 810.18
anything that I could even say about it

808.56 --> 813.42
that hasn't been said

810.18 --> 816.42
both on my show which was extremely

813.42 --> 818.279
elaborate I went into full detail as far

816.42 --> 820.4399999999999
as I could

818.279 --> 822.72
and on the Flat Earth debate so it's

820.44 --> 824.22
like yeah okay I think the point is just

822.72 --> 826.5
made and

824.22 --> 828.0
I pointed out that you can't technically

826.5 --> 830.82
take an angle

828.0 --> 832.38
to the Sun or any of the celestials just

830.82 --> 834.839
using a plumb bob

832.38 --> 837.36
and yes as soon as you start to hear

834.839 --> 841.0790000000001
certain words like vertical then you

837.36 --> 844.019
would automatically invoke a horizontal

841.079 --> 846.66
and blah as soon as you start to say oh

844.019 --> 848.82
the angle to what and then you come to a

846.66 --> 851.1
90 situation and that proves the

848.82 --> 855.6
flattered and yeah but none of that was

851.1 --> 859.139
my point and that was the point

855.6 --> 862.279
the point was hey maybe there's just

859.139 --> 865.92
this little isolated thingy

862.279 --> 867.48
and we can't just steam wall [ __ ] all

865.92 --> 868.9799999999999
the time

867.48 --> 871.86
because then

868.98 --> 875.76
we make little errors

871.86 --> 881.04
better than like printed out on giant

875.76 --> 883.079
posters for anti-flatter demonstrations

881.04 --> 884.66
right they'll use any stupid little

883.079 --> 887.0999999999999
error and just

884.66 --> 890.1
especially if it's an error that it's

887.1 --> 892.9200000000001
becoming systemic and being repeated

890.1 --> 894.72
and they'll just use that as a weapon

892.92 --> 897.3199999999999
then

894.72 --> 897.32
foreign

900.079 --> 905.579
strategy to adopt

902.699 --> 907.8
then just the usual double speak

905.579 --> 910.199
nonsense

907.8 --> 911.04
right because we know how to deal with

910.199 --> 915.5999999999999
that

911.04 --> 919.74
if we start to let little errors slip in

915.6 --> 921.36
then they suddenly get a real weapon

919.74 --> 923.519
again

921.36 --> 926.5790000000001
and at first it might not seem very

923.519 --> 930.66
strong but it might become stronger over

926.579 --> 932.92
time if you ignore such little errors

930.66 --> 936.12
anyway

932.92 --> 936.12
[Music]

943.92 --> 948.86
go okay PJ Cruz I didn't see it

954.899 --> 957.899
okay

971.43 --> 982.0999999999999
[Music]

979.26 --> 982.1
right

985.5 --> 992.12
so yeah other than that I did not really

987.66 --> 992.12
have a subject I've been kind of just

997.38 --> 1002.3
Restless I think it's all just this

1000.5 --> 1003.17
weather where there's just this constant

1002.3 --> 1004.9399999999999
wind

1003.17 --> 1008.18
[Music]

1004.94 --> 1012.44
just kind of gets on my nerves

1008.18 --> 1016.899
I have not finished watching uh

1012.44 --> 1016.899
the third Chronicles of Narnia movie yet

1017.42 --> 1020.5
didn't get to it

1021.92 --> 1027.9389999999999
but I will

1023.959 --> 1032.26
I've caught up on a lot of Owen Benjamin

1027.939 --> 1035.8390000000002
it's just been very interesting

1032.26 --> 1038.179
I mean it really is as usual

1035.839 --> 1041.6599999999999
I mean

1038.179 --> 1044.5590000000002
Bad episodes are kind of rare to find

1041.66 --> 1044.559
nowadays

1048.38 --> 1051.5200000000002
uh what else

1070.43 --> 1075.8200000000002
[Music]

1072.679 --> 1075.8200000000002
yeah not a lot

1079.7 --> 1083.26
what was I doing yesterday

1088.31 --> 1091.95
[Music]

1099.039 --> 1104.84
it's always so weird when

1102.26 --> 1106.34
I I'm like thinking about what I was

1104.84 --> 1108.98
doing

1106.34 --> 1111.32
and I'm I got a pretty decent oversight

1108.98 --> 1112.46
over like what I do because well also

1111.32 --> 1115.28
because

1112.46 --> 1117.32
it's not that complicated my life is

1115.28 --> 1119.78
really not that hectic it shouldn't be

1117.32 --> 1121.9399999999998
that hard but then a lot of the times

1119.78 --> 1125.24
when I try to remember back especially

1121.94 --> 1127.76
to like evening times

1125.24 --> 1130.76
that's always like this weird blur where

1127.76 --> 1133.34
I just like can't really remember what I

1130.76 --> 1136.52
was doing and then it's extra hard like

1133.34 --> 1138.62
the rest of it is like perfectly easily

1136.52 --> 1141.74
overseeable to me and like can almost

1138.62 --> 1143.84
literally simulate like the actual

1141.74 --> 1145.82
experience back and then I run into this

1143.84 --> 1148.82
moment

1145.82 --> 1151.24
or in this phase of the evening and then

1148.82 --> 1151.24
it's like

1151.46 --> 1156.08
unless there was something very

1153.559 --> 1158.96
specifically like for example a Jim Bob

1156.08 --> 1161.78
stream which makes it easier to remember

1158.96 --> 1165.02
then I'm always then I end up puzzled as

1161.78 --> 1167.24
to like what the hell was I doing why is

1165.02 --> 1170.98
this so complicated to remember every

1167.24 --> 1170.98
time it's ridiculous

1177.26 --> 1182.08
oh wait I think there was actually a gym

1179.48 --> 1182.08
of life

1183.44 --> 1189.98
the deception of Chaos

1186.14 --> 1192.919
but I was watching something else I just

1189.98 --> 1195.559
what was it

1192.919 --> 1199.0
it's not Netflix

1195.559 --> 1199.0
it wasn't Narnia either

1210.919 --> 1215.5
thank you

1212.78 --> 1215.5
anyway

1222.2 --> 1227.0
by the way did you see that what do you

1224.419 --> 1229.8400000000001
mean exactly a lot more positive in

1227.0 --> 1229.84
relation to what

1240.33 --> 1243.4299999999998
[Music]

1244.039 --> 1250.419
wow well Jared I guess that Cricket is

1247.46 --> 1253.96
like really popular

1250.419 --> 1253.96
in Pakistan

1254.059 --> 1259.12
if if they end up as Prime Ministers for

1256.82 --> 1259.12
winning

1259.34 --> 1262.48
Cricket Nation

1265.7 --> 1272.02
as in I got an apology yeah

1268.22 --> 1272.02
at least from Nathan

1272.72 --> 1279.82
also I wanted to yeah

1276.02 --> 1284.539
wanted to communicate that I took note

1279.82 --> 1287.299
that Elijah actually defended

1284.539 --> 1289.22
me like as a

1287.299 --> 1293.9
social gesture

1289.22 --> 1295.82
and I really appreciate that

1293.9 --> 1299.0590000000002
I mean we've been

1295.82 --> 1301.22
a little uncertain towards one another

1299.059 --> 1303.62
some yeah it's like sometimes we like

1301.22 --> 1304.58
bump we we get on each other's nerves or

1303.62 --> 1305.9599999999998
something

1304.58 --> 1309.5
but

1305.96 --> 1313.94
never like try to push that we know yeah

1309.5 --> 1316.76
and he just I mean he basically tried to

1313.94 --> 1319.52
call out 10th Man and say like hey maybe

1316.76 --> 1322.28
you shouldn't be like this

1319.52 --> 1327.34
right why are you being so

1322.28 --> 1327.34
divisive and I I'm yeah

1327.86 --> 1334.039
I've I've taken note of that thank you

1330.5 --> 1337.159
very much I really appreciate that

1334.039 --> 1338.72
because yeah tenth man his attitude

1337.159 --> 1342.2600000000002
towards me

1338.72 --> 1345.32
I'm used to stuff because I come from a

1342.26 --> 1347.059
past where I've been bullied a lot

1345.32 --> 1349.1589999999999
by groups

1347.059 --> 1351.86
right not individuals I've never been

1349.159 --> 1354.0200000000002
bullied by individuals It's Always by

1351.86 --> 1355.82
freaking groups

1354.02 --> 1358.22
yeah

1355.82 --> 1361.82
and by people that are really good with

1358.22 --> 1363.2
group dynamics and know how to basically

1361.82 --> 1365.84
like

1363.2 --> 1366.799
turn people against somebody they don't

1365.84 --> 1368.78
like

1366.799 --> 1371.179
I've had that a lot

1368.78 --> 1374.4189999999999
it's like my War

1371.179 --> 1376.72
and 10th man doing this to me is like

1374.419 --> 1376.72
War

1376.94 --> 1382.1000000000001
and that's actually more serious than it

1379.28 --> 1385.1
might seem on the surface I mean

1382.1 --> 1386.6
I'm noticing Tim if you're really going

1385.1 --> 1388.28
there

1386.6 --> 1390.86
I'm

1388.28 --> 1393.559
well not gonna do a lot about it because

1390.86 --> 1397.52
you're mostly digging your own bitter

1393.559 --> 1400.6399999999999
bitter ass grade that way yeah

1397.52 --> 1403.48
people appreciate me

1400.64 --> 1407.179
Nathan even appreciates me

1403.48 --> 1410.059
you can't slander and [ __ ] over the

1407.179 --> 1411.44
place in order to take that away if

1410.059 --> 1413.84
you're gonna try that all you're gonna

1411.44 --> 1417.0800000000002
do is make people associate that

1413.84 --> 1419.8999999999999
behavior with you

1417.08 --> 1423.28
yeah so keep going

1419.9 --> 1423.2800000000002
keep fighting your War

1424.28 --> 1426.8799999999999
okay

1430.28 --> 1434.22
[Music]

1434.32 --> 1438.76
uh

1435.919 --> 1438.76
okay anyway

1439.27 --> 1442.839
[Music]

1445.37 --> 1450.58
[Music]

1447.98 --> 1450.58
foreign

1450.87 --> 1456.7399999999998
[Music]

1452.86 --> 1459.62
so now of course the next issue because

1456.74 --> 1462.679
I'm afraid this wasn't it

1459.62 --> 1465.799
the next issue is going to be Brian and

1462.679 --> 1469.76
his dumbass statement about

1465.799 --> 1473.0
how in a Newtonian gravity model

1469.76 --> 1475.58
things shouldn't weigh more in a vacuum

1473.0 --> 1479.44
which is horseshit because buoyancy

1475.58 --> 1482.8999999999999
absolutely lockstep mirrors the entire

1479.44 --> 1484.7
scenario of relative density that was

1482.9 --> 1487.88
the whole magician's trick in the first

1484.7 --> 1491.3600000000001
place if there was an absurd obviously

1487.88 --> 1492.8600000000001
wrong and easily testable on Earth on

1491.36 --> 1495.74
ground level

1492.86 --> 1497.7199999999998
situation to prove it wrong

1495.74 --> 1500.1200000000001
then nothing about it would have ever

1497.72 --> 1502.64
worked right the whole point about the

1500.12 --> 1504.9189999999999
whole globe cosmology replacement

1502.64 --> 1508.8200000000002
mechanisms

1504.919 --> 1511.22
is that it actually mirrors reality

1508.82 --> 1513.74
that was the point of it that's what

1511.22 --> 1516.8600000000001
these astronomers

1513.74 --> 1517.64
have been building so hard on with their

1516.86 --> 1521.1399999999999
math

1517.64 --> 1524.179
for centuries to achieve that

1521.14 --> 1527.48
specifically right to mimic the

1524.179 --> 1530.6000000000001
functions of reality in another format

1527.48 --> 1533.48
so that they can accommodate for the

1530.6 --> 1534.62
potential of an outer space galaxy etc

1533.48 --> 1537.5
etc

1534.62 --> 1540.02
right but the claim

1537.5 --> 1542.48
that according to Newtonian mechanics

1540.02 --> 1545.48
things weigh less

1542.48 --> 1547.46
in air or in a vacuum

1545.48 --> 1552.44
then in air is

1547.46 --> 1555.26
is so dumb that's like a a a pre-teen

1552.44 --> 1556.76
mistake on Brian's part and I'm really

1555.26 --> 1558.919
embarrassed that he's making that

1556.76 --> 1560.179
mistake because he should know better

1558.919 --> 1564.3400000000001
than that

1560.179 --> 1564.3400000000001
right so that issue is still gonna hold

1567.26 --> 1573.679
but yeah as far as concerned the

1571.1 --> 1576.86
the whole angle situation I think that's

1573.679 --> 1578.779
just soft I mean all I ever wanted to do

1576.86 --> 1580.34
was just point out that you can

1578.779 --> 1582.98
potentially

1580.34 --> 1585.6789999999999
get an angle to the Sun as a direct

1582.98 --> 1587.84
response to the inquiry

1585.679 --> 1589.3400000000001
how can you get an angle to the sun use

1587.84 --> 1593.12
a plumber

1589.34 --> 1596.84
see you got an angle that's it and then

1593.12 --> 1601.1
of course as soon as anything

1596.84 --> 1603.1399999999999
then comes in response to that or a

1601.1 --> 1606.1999999999998
continuation suggestion or another

1603.14 --> 1608.24
consequence yeah it's very likely that

1606.2 --> 1611.919
immediately The Horizon will come into

1608.24 --> 1615.2
play or the fact that the degree system

1611.919 --> 1616.9
has 90 degrees in the first instance

1615.2 --> 1619.94
like

1616.9 --> 1624.26
the the degree system

1619.94 --> 1625.279
already basically undoes the whole globe

1624.26 --> 1627.98
system

1625.279 --> 1631.34
that just how degrees work it's kind of

1627.98 --> 1635.179
silly like that right but that's not my

1631.34 --> 1638.1789999999999
point because I'm not a desperate Flat

1635.179 --> 1640.7
Earth they're like oh no I have to like

1638.179 --> 1643.5800000000002
get everything perfect like I could

1640.7 --> 1647.659
never yield to anything that could

1643.58 --> 1651.5
suggest that it might somehow not

1647.659 --> 1654.0800000000002
be a globe like what the [ __ ]

1651.5 --> 1655.94
like what the [ __ ] is your problem why

1654.08 --> 1658.96
are you so fearful

1655.94 --> 1658.96
of idiots

1659.12 --> 1665.059
yeah if something is true it's true it's

1661.94 --> 1667.7
not a threat because you're a flat

1665.059 --> 1669.74
earther and it's flat you're right

1667.7 --> 1673.039
aren't you well if you're right then

1669.74 --> 1677.96
nothing should be a threat so stop being

1673.039 --> 1681.14
so incredibly impulsively defensive

1677.96 --> 1684.039
it's a sign of weakness

1681.14 --> 1684.039
four percent

1685.659 --> 1690.38
you cannot get a horizontal from

1688.279 --> 1694.22
vertical well I don't need a horizontal

1690.38 --> 1696.7990000000002
to get an angle to the sum iron 26.

1694.22 --> 1702.02
I just need a plumb bob

1696.799 --> 1704.6
and like well a 90 degree angle thingy

1702.02 --> 1708.74
or I don't know a

1704.6 --> 1710.7199999999998
a Sextant held at 90 degrees angle or

1708.74 --> 1712.52
upward right you can just use a section

1710.72 --> 1714.74
and point it straight up

1712.52 --> 1715.7
and then try to parallel it to the plumb

1714.74 --> 1717.799
bob

1715.7 --> 1720.039
and then you do pretty much the same

1717.799 --> 1720.039
thing

1728.419 --> 1734.9
until you measure it

1732.14 --> 1737.9
okay fine you were trying to say the

1734.9 --> 1741.14
thing same thing I think anyway my point

1737.9 --> 1743.179
was is that yeah just as a direct

1741.14 --> 1745.279
response

1743.179 --> 1747.74
you don't always start out with the

1745.279 --> 1752.32
horizontal the horror The Horizon is not

1747.74 --> 1752.32
the beginning of everything it isn't

1753.919 --> 1759.3200000000002
it doesn't have to be there's other

1756.44 --> 1760.46
things you can use a plumb bob now of

1759.32 --> 1762.6789999999999
course as soon as you're going to

1760.46 --> 1765.38
integrate that

1762.679 --> 1767.779
with something more than just getting

1765.38 --> 1770.8400000000001
that angle to a Celestial yeah then it's

1767.779 --> 1773.96
very likely the Horizon will soon soon

1770.84 --> 1777.799
start to get involved

1773.96 --> 1780.02
and then it's over for any kind of glow

1777.799 --> 1782.0
popes and Globe hopes and dreams right

1780.02 --> 1783.559
of a geometric Horizon that'll be over

1782.0 --> 1788.2
very quickly

1783.559 --> 1788.2
right that was never my point

1789.26 --> 1795.679
my point is is that it's kind of stupid

1791.74 --> 1797.96
for flat earthers in their Bluster and

1795.679 --> 1801.38
overconfidence

1797.96 --> 1803.72
the shout that you could never

1801.38 --> 1805.46
do you could never get an angle without

1803.72 --> 1808.7
a horizon

1805.46 --> 1811.58
that's just wrong it's wrong it's wrong

1808.7 --> 1813.8600000000001
it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong and I

1811.58 --> 1814.9399999999998
don't care what you think about it it's

1813.86 --> 1817.279
wrong

1814.94 --> 1818.3600000000001
you can

1817.279 --> 1822.32
yeah

1818.36 --> 1825.1999999999998
and whatever words you use in relation

1822.32 --> 1828.399
doesn't really matter to the fact that

1825.2 --> 1831.44
when it comes to practical measurement

1828.399 --> 1834.08
you do not need the Horizon to get an

1831.44 --> 1836.1200000000001
angle to a Celestial body and that's a

1834.08 --> 1839.6589999999999
fact and there's nothing anybody can do

1836.12 --> 1842.059
about that that that is a fact

1839.659 --> 1845.2990000000002
however as soon as you want to actually

1842.059 --> 1848.0
engage in proper Celestial navigation

1845.299 --> 1851.08
you're gonna need the Horizon especially

1848.0 --> 1851.08
on the ocean right

1852.86 --> 1860.12
but that yeah doesn't take away the

1855.86 --> 1861.74
mechanical logical fact that you do not

1860.12 --> 1864.32
necessarily

1861.74 --> 1866.659
that that you do not necessarily need

1864.32 --> 1869.899
the Horizon to get an angle to the

1866.659 --> 1872.659
celestials that's it that's the only

1869.899 --> 1874.8799999999999
thing but it is something that is a

1872.659 --> 1878.659
thing and that is true and that if you

1874.88 --> 1881.6000000000001
watch over it and you mis designate it

1878.659 --> 1884.8990000000001
and say no you can't then you're just

1881.6 --> 1888.6789999999999
being wrong and you're letting the wrong

1884.899 --> 1890.539
rub off on you and everybody that

1888.679 --> 1893.179
Associates with you

1890.539 --> 1896.84
while the opponent stares at you and

1893.179 --> 1899.539
starts saying oh see oh thank God I knew

1896.84 --> 1901.58
it I knew it see Flat Earth this can be

1899.539 --> 1903.3799999999999
wrong and don't even know it they

1901.58 --> 1906.08
constantly say this and it's wrong so

1903.38 --> 1908.0
yeah I knew I had a good reason to say

1906.08 --> 1910.8799999999999
that all flat earthers are stupid look

1908.0 --> 1914.24
at them yeah is that what you want

1910.88 --> 1916.419
or or now you don't care

1914.24 --> 1919.46
you don't care now or something oh well

1916.419 --> 1922.64
how about we don't give them any

1919.46 --> 1924.8600000000001
unnecessary tools against us how about

1922.64 --> 1928.3400000000001
that

1924.86 --> 1931.2199999999998
yeah against people

1928.34 --> 1934.8799999999999
I mean argumentatively

1931.22 --> 1936.919
we couldn't give them any actual tools

1934.88 --> 1940.88
to win with because there are no such

1936.919 --> 1942.14
tools I should know I build tools like

1940.88 --> 1946.659
that

1942.14 --> 1946.659
they cannot win with those tools

1946.82 --> 1953.96
right because the truth is the truth a

1951.08 --> 1956.1399999999999
reality Works how reality Works does it

1953.96 --> 1956.14
matter

1956.419 --> 1964.46
so just don't worry so much

1960.44 --> 1966.8600000000001
worry more about being nitpicky over

1964.46 --> 1971.8400000000001
your own words

1966.86 --> 1974.4799999999998
and ensuring on a more direct level that

1971.84 --> 1977.4189999999999
you don't get details wrong

1974.48 --> 1979.82
because there are people having a loop

1977.419 --> 1982.039
over you and they are judging you

1979.82 --> 1984.5
whether you think they have the right

1982.039 --> 1988.34
for that or not they are

1984.5 --> 1991.46
so you better just do it right

1988.34 --> 1993.98
all the time no exception

1991.46 --> 1996.14
right and you guys like to call each

1993.98 --> 1997.7
other out and like oh look what if

1996.14 --> 2000.1000000000001
you'll as soon as you say 90 degrees

1997.7 --> 2003.82
that's all rising and it's over right

2000.1 --> 2005.5
there's a logical conclusion systems

2003.82 --> 2007.12
that's good

2005.5 --> 2009.22
that we have that

2007.12 --> 2011.1999999999998
and it makes it's kind of Niche right

2009.22 --> 2014.019
because it really shows like wow we have

2011.2 --> 2016.179
such oversight we have a real concrete

2014.019 --> 2021.64
expertise there

2016.179 --> 2026.3200000000002
but if that then spoils you

2021.64 --> 2030.7
huh then you arrive potentially at the

2026.32 --> 2034.299
victory defeating you scenario

2030.7 --> 2037.6000000000001
because you get sloppy

2034.299 --> 2041.08
and you start to say oh what you can get

2037.6 --> 2045.279
an angle to the to the sun without the

2041.08 --> 2048.339
Horizon yeah yeah you can now you just

2045.279 --> 2051.099
within Victory position you just

2048.339 --> 2054.639
potentially ruined the war

2051.099 --> 2056.44
yeah because in a victory position it's

2054.639 --> 2058.659
much riskier

2056.44 --> 2061.2400000000002
you have to pay attention to what you're

2058.659 --> 2063.48
saying you have to be correct now

2061.24 --> 2066.9399999999996
right if you're in a losing position

2063.48 --> 2069.159
people expect you to go wild

2066.94 --> 2072.159
right

2069.159 --> 2075.58
like a cat driven in a corner

2072.159 --> 2077.98
but if you are in a winning position you

2075.58 --> 2081.7
do not have that luxury

2077.98 --> 2085.96
that that natural Earthly Grace you

2081.7 --> 2088.839
could call it through the social laws

2085.96 --> 2091.899
the actual laws of the deep Spirit not

2088.839 --> 2095.56
of anything else just how it works right

2091.899 --> 2098.22
what we expect so you got to do it right

2095.56 --> 2098.22

2391.72 --> 2397.1189999999997

2394.359 --> 2399.66
backlash just by himself without us

2397.119 --> 2399.6600000000003
doing that

2399.94 --> 2402.48
you know

2403.06 --> 2408.16
unless he's gonna keep pushing that

2405.22 --> 2411.7599999999998
attitude I mean if he's really just not

2408.16 --> 2415.06
gonna back down back to a civil stance

2411.76 --> 2417.9
then yeah then by all means start piling

2415.06 --> 2421.18
on but I don't yeah it's not there yet

2417.9 --> 2424.48
stand by halt

2421.18 --> 2426.7
wait for my signal uh

2424.48 --> 2430.98
thinking back about that

the Narnia movie again Prince Caspian

wait for it

2438.28 --> 2441.78
yeah stay in formation

2443.2 --> 2445.859
ah

2461.56 --> 2464.7
and what

2467.079 --> 2471.94
every measurement ever taken is subject

2469.9 --> 2474.1600000000003
to a margin of error

2471.94 --> 2478.42
yeah which should be absolutely insane

2474.16 --> 2480.96
like insignificant literally yeah

2478.42 --> 2480.96
minute

2484.599 --> 2491.26
because if it's like if there's just a

2487.839 --> 2495.04
significant percentage

2491.26 --> 2498.0400000000004
off in the measurement it becomes deemed

2495.04 --> 2498.04
unreliable

[Music]

2513.91 --> 2519.16
[Music]

2516.339 --> 2521.14
the margin of error no no that but it is

2519.16 --> 2522.48
a fair assessment seeking star water I

2521.14 --> 2525.8199999999997
mean

2522.48 --> 2529.06
it's that's what you do with back

2525.82 --> 2531.04
engineering right you figure out the

2529.06 --> 2533.0789999999997
margin of error of what you know about

2531.04 --> 2535.72
it and the likelihood of it being

2533.079 --> 2538.119
correct and not and how that then

2535.72 --> 2540.2999999999997
keeps continuing within the potential of

2538.119 --> 2540.3
it

2544.18 --> 2549.94
I mean yeah

2547.24 --> 2554.7999999999997
maybe yeah if you're gonna relate it to

2549.94 --> 2557.68
the supposed geometric Horizons then the

2554.8 --> 2559.6600000000003
margin of error is a little different

2557.68 --> 2562.1189999999997
type of predicament

2559.66 --> 2564.64
it's going to be important difficult

2562.119 --> 2566.8
because you can't really have a margin

2564.64 --> 2568.24
of error in that I mean when you're map

2566.8 --> 2570.46
making

2568.24 --> 2574.359
yeah you can have a margin of error that

2570.46 --> 2576.82
because it's freaking cartography man I

2574.359 --> 2578.44
mean that is like the whole challenge of

2576.82 --> 2582.599
it

2578.44 --> 2585.4
but when it comes to like establishing

2582.599 --> 2589.6600000000003
geometric facts

2585.4 --> 2591.579
like measuring the Horizon as well a

2589.66 --> 2594.0989999999997
geometric Horizon

2591.579 --> 2597.3590000000004
yeah the margin of error is not going to

2594.099 --> 2597.3590000000004
be as lenient

2598.18 --> 2603.52
because

2600.28 --> 2606.119
yeah because of the simplistic nature of

2603.52 --> 2606.119

like ball winning it

2808.9 --> 2811.44
something

2816.339 --> 2820.839

talking about

2830.38 --> 2835.26

2835.66 --> 2842.04
how did how did you get the radius value

2838.0 --> 2842.04
if it's refracted etc etc

2845.14 --> 2851.5
creation okay hello

2848.2 --> 2854.0789999999997
all right my teeth the best sounded

2851.5 --> 2856.18
I think people are heavily divided about

2854.079 --> 2858.7000000000003
that sound

2856.18 --> 2860.68
I guess some of you have gotten used to

2858.7 --> 2862.839
it or even to like it

2860.68 --> 2866.7599999999998
there's people out there that it drives

2862.839 --> 2866.7599999999998
them nuts for some reason

2869.14 --> 2872.47
not that I really care because I'm just

2871.599 --> 2875.38
gonna do it anyway

2872.47 --> 2877.2999999999997
[Music]

2875.38 --> 2879.71

2879.71 --> 2883.86
[Music]

2887.52 --> 2891.24
gonna be a good day

2892.72 --> 2895.3799999999997
right

2898.54 --> 2903.099
that is kind of typical because if I

2900.88 --> 2905.1400000000003
don't feel good then I usually don't

2903.099 --> 2907.48
start pouring tea because then the tea

2905.14 --> 2909.7
actually makes me worse

2907.48 --> 2911.619
so I only really start drinking tea in

2909.7 --> 2915.0989999999997
the first place if I'm feeling good it's

2911.619 --> 2918.6400000000003
even a bit it's like a part of the test

2915.099 --> 2921.46
like when I drink tea I can feel like oh

2918.64 --> 2923.14
I'm not doing too great I might have to

2921.46 --> 2925.48
be careful with the tea or it's like oh

2923.14 --> 2927.46
no this is great then I know I'm doing

2925.48 --> 2929.38
great so there's actually funnily enough

2927.46 --> 2931.78
kind of a point to what you're saying

2929.38 --> 2934.38
there a creation bear

2931.78 --> 2934.38
foreign

2955.48 --> 2962.38
what

2956.92 --> 2964.66
what are you saying thorsi Casey Webb

2962.38 --> 2968.76
you're on the thumbnail for fed today

2964.66 --> 2968.7599999999998
yeah I think I was yesterday too

2971.69 --> 2978.7200000000003
[Music]

2984.5 --> 2987.57
[Music]

2994.0 --> 2998.16
or yeah that was on the members only

2995.8 --> 2998.1600000000003
video

3027.06 --> 3031.02
anyway I'm gonna lead the lonely like

3028.92 --> 3034.099
what exactly what what kind of Point

3031.02 --> 3034.099
were you trying to make

3035.42 --> 3038.96
ignoring refraction

3040.5 --> 3044.359
for purpose of the demonstration

3046.0 --> 3049.05
[Music]

3051.599 --> 3055.98
I mean were you invoking a geometric

3053.94 --> 3058.26
Horizon

3055.98 --> 3061.339
why

3058.26 --> 3061.3390000000004
for what purpose

3062.87 --> 3068.5389999999998
[Music]

3084.0 --> 3089.64
foreign

3086.359 --> 3091.22
of the drop below eye level

3089.64 --> 3094.69
okay

3091.22 --> 3094.6899999999996
[Music]

3098.64 --> 3103.52
right because there is always a bit of a

3101.099 --> 3103.52
correction

3108.67 --> 3114.92
[Music]

3111.599 --> 3116.9
well isn't basically the angular size

3114.92 --> 3121.02
below eye level

3116.9 --> 3122.94
usually relatively small right

3121.02 --> 3125.66
which on technically if you were

3122.94 --> 3128.339
standing on the globe

3125.66 --> 3132.0789999999997
barring terrestrial refraction for a

3128.339 --> 3132.0789999999997
second well then

3132.42 --> 3136.98
the the drop

3135.359 --> 3139.0789999999997
from the

3136.98 --> 3141.119
well the horizontal which in yeah

3139.079 --> 3144.54
wouldn't be the horizontal because it

3141.119 --> 3148.2000000000003
now it's a ball so it's uh yeah it's not

3144.54 --> 3150.72
that actual Horizon anymore

3148.2 --> 3153.48
the higher up you go it should all like

3150.72 --> 3157.64
the the amount of dip let's just call a

3153.48 --> 3157.64
dip should be pretty extreme

3160.02 --> 3165.48
it never is of course

3162.66 --> 3168.7799999999997
because like even if you go up very high

3165.48 --> 3171.78
it's going to be the Horizon the visual

3168.78 --> 3174.0
effect of the Horizon usually it's going

3171.78 --> 3177.0
to end up with a black sky above and

3174.0 --> 3178.619
blue sky below

3177.0 --> 3181.8
remember that

3178.619 --> 3183.96
but it's still going to be well slightly

3181.8 --> 3187.26
below eye level

3183.96 --> 3190.14
and then basically rise with you to

3187.26 --> 3192.3590000000004
exactly that same amount of slightly

3190.14 --> 3194.46
below eye level

3192.359 --> 3198.24
it happens

3194.46 --> 3202.339
right because that border that Horizon

3198.24 --> 3205.4399999999996
border between black and blue doesn't

3202.339 --> 3208.02
gradually go down as you go higher up

3205.44 --> 3211.619
that doesn't happen

3208.02 --> 3213.059
Horizon stays at slightly below eye

3211.619 --> 3216.3
level

3213.059 --> 3219.48
and then just keeps migrating with you

3216.3 --> 3223.099
whether you go up or down it keeps

3219.48 --> 3226.14
at the exact same relative height

3223.099 --> 3228.0
slightly below eye level

3226.14 --> 3230.4
that's just what happens practically

3228.0 --> 3234.3
with the horizon

3230.4 --> 3237.78
yeah that system could never work

3234.3 --> 3241.1400000000003
I doubt it could even even be calculated

3237.78 --> 3244.2000000000003
technically with terrestrial refraction

3241.14 --> 3247.92
I mean how how could you possibly have

3244.2 --> 3250.98
some kind of light bendy system that

3247.92 --> 3254.46
would enable you to have a horizon

3250.98 --> 3257.04
slightly below I love wet any height

3254.46 --> 3258.96
like it really I'd like to see a

3257.04 --> 3261.839
simulation of that terrestrial

3258.96 --> 3264.66
refraction in an array tracing in a ray

3261.839 --> 3267.0589999999997
traced ball I want to see how that works

3264.66 --> 3268.7599999999998
rumpus can you do it I know you're

3267.059 --> 3272.1600000000003
already like 99

3268.76 --> 3274.559
done with simulating just that Horizon

3272.16 --> 3278.22
at the beach that one time I know you're

3274.559 --> 3282.599
already 99 done but I mean

3278.22 --> 3286.319
this would be even better right

3282.599 --> 3290.819
if you could like calculate

3286.319 --> 3294.0589999999997
simulate a CGI model in which it would

3290.819 --> 3295.74
literally be on a ball yet the

3294.059 --> 3297.9
terrestrial refraction would make it

3295.74 --> 3301.319
look perfectly flat

3297.9 --> 3304.28
all you have to do is just have that

3301.319 --> 3308.339
formula right terrestrial refraction

3304.28 --> 3312.079
formula you have to perfect it

3308.339 --> 3312.0789999999997
grumpus is here no

3319.079 --> 3323.88
I'm yeah I'm just talking to the spirit

3321.3 --> 3326.42
of rhombus I'm not talking literally to

3323.88 --> 3326.42
rumpus

3331.92 --> 3335.7000000000003
on a ball Horizon drops dramatically

3334.079 --> 3339.059
immediately

3335.7 --> 3341.46
yeah it's supposed to

3339.059 --> 3344.28
and then to rest your refraction made it

3341.46 --> 3347.579
all very complicated

3344.28 --> 3351.2400000000002
because it doesn't but then how could

3347.579 --> 3354.059
you ever Ascend outside of ball Earth

3351.24 --> 3356.16
and see it as a ball

3354.059 --> 3359.52
when the Horizon is always moving with

3356.16 --> 3361.74
you and slightly below eye level like

3359.52 --> 3363.54
when does it actually turn into a ball

3361.74 --> 3365.72
and you look back and it's like whoa

3363.54 --> 3368.52
It's a ball it's right there it's a ball

3365.72 --> 3371.64
when did it turn from a

3368.52 --> 3374.4
slightly below eye level

3371.64 --> 3377.22
thing to suddenly like oh oh now it's

3374.4 --> 3379.2000000000003
the ball I'm I'm staring in One

3377.22 --> 3380.16
Direction and it's a ball how did that

3379.2 --> 3383.8999999999996
happen

3380.16 --> 3383.8999999999996
oh you didn't see any of that

3385.14 --> 3387.319
in that

3395.099 --> 3399.839
right so yeah the terrestrial refraction

3397.38 --> 3403.2200000000003
situation still is not going to solve

3399.839 --> 3408.18
the well the transition from

3403.22 --> 3410.819
terrestrial sites to outer space sites

3408.18 --> 3413.16
how are you going to transition it you

3410.819 --> 3416.52
know how is it gonna morph

3413.16 --> 3417.7799999999997
in a believable fashion that's a

3416.52 --> 3419.819
difficult one

3417.78 --> 3421.92
it's actually so difficult that it's

3419.819 --> 3423.96
never been tackled ever not even in

3421.92 --> 3427.28
cinematic history

3423.96 --> 3427.28
that just don't do it

3428.819 --> 3434.64
right the only way they do it is on fake

3432.72 --> 3437.64
CGI

3434.64 --> 3437.64
planets

3438.359 --> 3443.46
that are able and they are at the

3441.359 --> 3446.819
surface and then they zoom out

3443.46 --> 3450.9
yeah but the problem is they can only do

3446.819 --> 3453.9
that in the top down view scenario

3450.9 --> 3456.599
because they could never actually at the

3453.9 --> 3458.7000000000003
surface at first make it look realistic

3456.599 --> 3461.2200000000003
like a real Earth

3458.7 --> 3462.7799999999997
which in reality looks very much flat

3461.22 --> 3467.64
right

3462.78 --> 3470.4
so they can only show you a top down

3467.64 --> 3472.92
few and then like oh oh it's going away

3470.4 --> 3475.319
oh look oh it's it's a ball yeah that's

3472.92 --> 3478.02
like the best they could ever do

3475.319 --> 3480.839
because they could never have that view

3478.02 --> 3482.88
actually sit on that ball and make it

3480.839 --> 3487.319
look realistic before a lift off like

3482.88 --> 3490.98
that even in CGI they can't do it

3487.319 --> 3495.3
because as soon as you get realism View

3490.98 --> 3497.76
or Terra bound view on the planet

3495.3 --> 3500.04
cameras always going to be parallel with

3497.76 --> 3502.98
the Horizon right

3500.04 --> 3505.64
and then it's flat because that's the

3502.98 --> 3508.38
only way it looks realistic

3505.64 --> 3509.94
otherwise it's just not believe what's a

3508.38 --> 3512.48
real place

3509.94 --> 3512.48
yeah

3512.96 --> 3518.46
kind of important for the whole suspense

3516.48 --> 3520.7400000000002
of disbelief with science fiction is

3518.46 --> 3522.96
that oh The Landing party is going to

3520.74 --> 3525.5989999999997
the planet the mysterious planet well

3522.96 --> 3528.42
guess what if they then arrive there and

3525.599 --> 3530.579
it doesn't actually look like there it's

3528.42 --> 3532.98
a real place

3530.579 --> 3535.7400000000002
it's all balled up

3532.98 --> 3537.2400000000002
it's going to ruin the suspense of

3535.74 --> 3539.5789999999997
disbelief and people are going to be

3537.24 --> 3541.4399999999996
like what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] this

3539.579 --> 3544.1400000000003
doesn't look real at all

3541.44 --> 3546.48
that's not how it looks

3544.14 --> 3550.799
get it right get it right science

3546.48 --> 3553.98
fiction makers you know that on ball

3550.799 --> 3556.619
planets when you're actually there it

3553.98 --> 3559.26
looks has to look flat like on Earth

3556.619 --> 3562.7400000000002
because otherwise it makes no sense it's

3559.26 --> 3565.1400000000003
crazy so yeah it's a ball but it has to

3562.74 --> 3567.5989999999997
look flat when they're at the surface

3565.14 --> 3570.5
damn it get it right

3567.599 --> 3570.5
all right

3582.319 --> 3590.46
the hazards of the ball wizard

3587.52 --> 3592.68
so difficult to be a good ball wizard

3590.46 --> 3596.04
Entertainer because you're constantly

3592.68 --> 3598.3799999999997
you're dealing with children

3596.04 --> 3599.819
and some of those children are like in

3598.38 --> 3602.46
their 80s

3599.819 --> 3606.599
but you're dealing with children telling

3602.46 --> 3608.16
a story and they have to like it even if

3606.599 --> 3610.8590000000004
it makes no sense

3608.16 --> 3612.359
right so if you're like over emphasizing

3610.859 --> 3615.5989999999997
like oh everything has to be available

3612.359 --> 3619.38
all the horizons have to be balls

3615.599 --> 3622.1400000000003
then yeah well the dream recipient the

3619.38 --> 3624.48
client you could call it

3622.14 --> 3626.46
is going to be like that's wrong it

3624.48 --> 3629.76
doesn't look real at all it has to look

3626.46 --> 3631.7400000000002
like on earth flat well they won't say

3629.76 --> 3633.5400000000004
flat but that is what they will be

3631.74 --> 3634.799
looking for

3633.54 --> 3637.579
right

3634.799 --> 3640.799
so you have as a ball wizard

3637.579 --> 3643.7400000000002
Storyteller or science fiction writer

3640.799 --> 3645.24
Movie Maker you always have to just

3643.74 --> 3648.0589999999997
appease

3645.24 --> 3650.9599999999996
children by telling the story the way

3648.059 --> 3650.96
they want it

3651.18 --> 3657.66
and not to not to like impose some

3655.319 --> 3659.22
technical rules about how it's supposed

3657.66 --> 3664.14
to be

3659.22 --> 3667.4399999999996
like the worlds and the planets yeah

3664.14 --> 3670.02
if you do that it's going to be nerdy

3667.44 --> 3672.26
and it's going to lose massive amounts

3670.02 --> 3674.339
of popular attention which would mean

3672.26 --> 3678.7200000000003
Less sales

3674.339 --> 3679.7
which is well part of the whole point

3678.72 --> 3682.7999999999997
of Science Fiction

3679.7 --> 3682.7999999999997
[Music]

3686.94 --> 3690.18
right

3688.26 --> 3695.5200000000004
good science fiction

3690.18 --> 3698.94
has some ciao for the Nerds and has some

3695.52 --> 3701.7
ciao for the dreamers

3698.94 --> 3703.319
foreign

3701.7 --> 3705.68
those are the best science fiction

3703.319 --> 3705.68
movies

[Music]

3720.96 --> 3723.5
all right

3724.98 --> 3732.2400000000002
I mean it should be the ultimate motto

3729.0 --> 3735.359
of science fiction movie making

3732.24 --> 3738.319
never let reality get in the way of

3735.359 --> 3738.319
making a good movie

4088.64 --> 4094.94
well if they're properly drunk yeah

4092.96 --> 4097.52
but like a little under influence

4094.94 --> 4102.04
doesn't have to like lead to [ __ ] every

4097.52 --> 4102.040000000001
single time but like what the [ __ ]

4102.799 --> 4108.799
I mean drunk people

4105.52 --> 4112.339000000001
attempting to attack others

4108.799 --> 4114.58
is a bad sign that means there's bad

4112.339 --> 4120.199
spirits hanging around

4114.58 --> 4124.4
bad spirits alcohol vacating making you

4120.199 --> 4126.98
a potential entry point for spirits

4124.4 --> 4129.739
so yeah if drunk people get like

4126.98 --> 4131.839
aggressive that's a bad sign that's a

4129.739 --> 4134.139999999999
sign that there's bad energy hanging in

4131.839 --> 4134.14
the air

4134.899 --> 4138.4490000000005
[Music]

4139.04 --> 4144.44
no one backed you up

4141.44 --> 4144.44
what

4145.04 --> 4147.58
what

4147.62 --> 4150.339
damn

4152.42 --> 4157.54
holy [ __ ] that's really bad

4158.96 --> 4165.02
I mean yeah people just going ballistic

4162.44 --> 4169.239
or whatever is one thing but that nobody

4165.02 --> 4169.2390000000005
then backs you up that is

4171.02 --> 4174.9800000000005
if that happened to me I'd never go back

4173.179 --> 4177.88
ever again

4174.98 --> 4177.879999999999
it's that simple

4184.27 --> 4187.539000000001
[Music]

4188.42 --> 4195.14
you aren't in the Inner Circle

4192.01 --> 4195.14
[Music]

4199.58 --> 4203.199
but I don't like that though

4203.9 --> 4208.94
I mean not being in the Inner Circle

4206.78 --> 4213.699
should not mean you should be treated

4208.94 --> 4213.699
like a second class citizen or something

4214.4 --> 4234.259999999999
this is ridiculous

4216.12 --> 4236.0
[Music]

4234.26 --> 4238.6990000000005
if you treat other people like that you

4236.0 --> 4243.159
can be a real flat earther

4238.699 --> 4243.159
a real Flat Earth

4244.159 --> 4246.339999999999
foreign

4248.42 --> 4255.02
I know what you mean that's an old that

4252.32 --> 4259.12
that's like a Patricia stair way of

4255.02 --> 4259.120000000001
saying it I get a gear shifter

4259.22 --> 4263.42
[Music]

4260.48 --> 4266.0599999999995
but I I I'd rather emphasize is that

4263.42 --> 4267.9800000000005
just because you are dabbling in Flat

4266.06 --> 4271.780000000001
Earth lore and you're into that doesn't

4267.98 --> 4271.78
mean you're automatically a good person

4271.94 --> 4278.54
[Music]

4276.219 --> 4282.08
somebody who understands Flat Earth

4278.54 --> 4284.719
understands the world no no that's not a

4282.08 --> 4286.88
guarantee at all yeah what the

4284.719 --> 4289.4
rudimentaries are of being a flat

4286.88 --> 4291.62
earther is that you understand that the

4289.4 --> 4294.259999999999
world that there is something there in

4291.62 --> 4296.48
the world persistently

4294.26 --> 4299.0
including money Powers trying to deceive

4296.48 --> 4301.459999999999
everybody that doesn't automatically

4299.0 --> 4303.8
mean

4301.46 --> 4306.44
that you're going to be

4303.8 --> 4309.1990000000005
like Christian about it like do good

4306.44 --> 4313.159
unto others as you do them unto you that

4309.199 --> 4315.199
does not automatically come in there

4313.159 --> 4319.219
with the flat earther

4315.199 --> 4321.0199999999995
yeah they can turn into very egotistical

4319.219 --> 4323.84
demons about it as well and just say

4321.02 --> 4326.360000000001
like no everybody's just full of idiots

4323.84 --> 4327.9800000000005
and I don't respect them anymore I'm

4326.36 --> 4330.38
just gonna treat them like second-class

4327.98 --> 4333.259999999999
citizens now yeah that can happen just

4330.38 --> 4336.219
as well it all depends

4333.26 --> 4336.219
on the person

4336.92 --> 4342.8
and how they've been raised what

4340.219 --> 4345.86
principles have they collected for

4342.8 --> 4348.1990000000005
themselves along the way

4345.86 --> 4350.0599999999995
yeah flat earther being a flat earther

4348.199 --> 4353.659
doesn't automatically make you a good

4350.06 --> 4355.9400000000005
guy it gives you a lot of incentive to

4353.659 --> 4357.379999999999
become a good guy because it's much more

4355.94 --> 4361.339999999999
rewarding

4357.38 --> 4364.400000000001
yeah to get that close to God to really

4361.34 --> 4367.52
realize the truth and how it works and

4364.4 --> 4370.82
the challenge of God for everybody and

4367.52 --> 4372.56
why it is there right all the the purest

4370.82 --> 4374.96
Insight it gives you that opportunity

4372.56 --> 4377.06
but that doesn't mean that just because

4374.96 --> 4379.1
you learn about Flat Earth that that's

4377.06 --> 4381.26
gonna be your end result

4379.1 --> 4384.820000000001
that's up to you

4381.26 --> 4384.820000000001
you have to decide that

4386.09 --> 4390.92
[Music]

4388.52 --> 4393.92
huh

4390.92 --> 4393.92
foreign

4394.0 --> 4397.9
well good lesson to learn

4399.32 --> 4403.159
right they're still all people just

4401.719 --> 4404.54
because they have a piece of knowledge

4403.159 --> 4406.58
doesn't make them spiritually

4404.54 --> 4408.88
enlightened that doesn't automatically

4406.58 --> 4408.88
happen

4410.54 --> 4418.82
right and by the way I had a weird more

4414.38 --> 4421.78
neutral thing like that even in 2019

4418.82 --> 4421.78
with Jaren

4422.54 --> 4427.46
I mean

4424.34 --> 4430.28
I mean in 2019 right the first time I

4427.46 --> 4432.92
made a physical appearance

4430.28 --> 4437.12
with with other flat earthers

4432.92 --> 4438.14
and literally everybody everybody that

4437.12 --> 4440.719
was there

4438.14 --> 4441.62
was kind of nice or at least polite to

4440.719 --> 4444.64
me

4441.62 --> 4444.64
but not Jared

4445.82 --> 4450.799999999999
Jaren was actually and that was in the

4447.92 --> 4452.54
time when I had no negative thoughts

4450.8 --> 4454.77
about him at all

4452.54 --> 4456.199
and he would be like no

4454.77 --> 4458.659000000001
[Music]

4456.199 --> 4460.879999999999
I don't like he was just like the first

4458.659 --> 4463.159
one like I was kind of trying to fit in

4460.88 --> 4465.02
right which yeah that you might call

4463.159 --> 4467.36
that like Petty Behavior or whatever I

4465.02 --> 4468.679
didn't like Go full Graveler on it but I

4467.36 --> 4471.38
was just like

4468.679 --> 4473.06
hi I'm new I I want to figure that I

4471.38 --> 4477.6990000000005
want to get to know you guys

4473.06 --> 4477.6990000000005
and Jaren was like no I don't trust you

4479.96 --> 4484.34
like I was barely even a person he was

4482.42 --> 4488.2390000000005
the only one

4484.34 --> 4491.719
of everybody there that actually acted

4488.239 --> 4493.879999999999
like that to me the only one

4491.719 --> 4495.22
I immediately forgave him but I never

4493.88 --> 4498.439
forgot

4495.22 --> 4498.439
[Music]

4503.659 --> 4507.139999999999
that's because I look like a criminal

4505.46 --> 4510.14
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4507.14 --> 4510.14
geoshifter

4510.5 --> 4516.44
I don't look like a criminal

4513.679 --> 4520.1
at all especially with my with my long

4516.44 --> 4522.0199999999995
black leather Long Jacket that's totally

4520.1 --> 4525.56
unfair

4522.02 --> 4531.320000000001
I mean just because I have a extremely

4525.56 --> 4533.719
worn out long black leather jacket

4531.32 --> 4536.239
and like army boots that are equally

4533.719 --> 4539.06
worn out doesn't mean that I look like a

4536.239 --> 4539.839999999999
criminal I mean a real criminal would I

4539.06 --> 4544.360000000001
think

4539.84 --> 4544.360000000001
wear something a little bit more fancy

4544.46 --> 4549.9800000000005
so they don't stand out so much

4547.76 --> 4553.12
or stand out in a more positive way

4549.98 --> 4553.12
wouldn't you say

4553.34 --> 4556.46
or have like a standard hoodie or

4555.739 --> 4561.139999999999
whatever

4556.46 --> 4562.46
I mean do I really look like a criminal

4561.14 --> 4567.219
come on

4562.46 --> 4567.219
come on man another Criminal

4567.56 --> 4573.159000000001
yo it's just me bro I'm not a criminal

4576.679 --> 4579.679
yes

4580.219 --> 4585.8
but yeah this is kind of how it looked

4583.04 --> 4587.54
I mean yeah I wear black smooth

4585.8 --> 4590.1990000000005
criminals

4587.54 --> 4590.199
oh

4592.239 --> 4598.459999999999
Mexican drug lord

4595.34 --> 4600.56
all righty then

4598.46 --> 4602.9
a criminal looks like a politician yeah

4600.56 --> 4605.2390000000005
they're real criminals they wear suit

4602.9 --> 4608.92
and ties

4605.239 --> 4608.919999999999
and usually glasses

4617.06 --> 4620.84
foreign cartel

4622.34 --> 4629.12
well look I am kind of crazy though

4626.719 --> 4632.42
in the sense that especially back then

4629.12 --> 4635.719
yeah you go I gotta be fair

4632.42 --> 4638.3
I was kind of acting a bit crazy like

4635.719 --> 4641.0
because well

4638.3 --> 4643.46
some of you might remember I've had like

4641.0 --> 4646.159
really heavy dark World Vision

4643.46 --> 4648.86
flashbacks

4646.159 --> 4652.96
around two thousand

4648.86 --> 4652.96
16 that really started

4653.3 --> 4658.46
and

4654.76 --> 4660.860000000001
2019 was pretty much like right after

4658.46 --> 4664.82
the peak of all that

4660.86 --> 4667.099999999999
and I had some really weird things that

4664.82 --> 4669.92
I was basically

4667.1 --> 4672.4400000000005
basically asking like do you know what's

4669.92 --> 4675.38
going on with do you know me is there

4672.44 --> 4676.639999999999
something that you know about me that I

4675.38 --> 4679.159000000001
don't know

4676.64 --> 4681.38
there's things happen in my past that I

4679.159 --> 4683.719
just don't know

4681.38 --> 4685.9400000000005
but I feel something happened I have all

4683.719 --> 4687.56
these weird memories I was kind of like

4685.94 --> 4690.44
inquiring

4687.56 --> 4693.320000000001
I even told Karen B some of that

4690.44 --> 4696.5
and Adam meekin

4693.32 --> 4699.62
and it was really confusing to me

4696.5 --> 4701.659
I felt like I might be really I might

4699.62 --> 4703.88
have a really scary past but I can't

4701.659 --> 4705.259999999999
trace it back and I've had all these

4703.88 --> 4707.900000000001
memories

4705.26 --> 4710.12
of like even like going to the police

4707.9 --> 4712.82
and trying to

4710.12 --> 4715.64
like confess something and then the

4712.82 --> 4719.0199999999995
police just said like no

4715.64 --> 4719.02
they didn't believe me

4721.0 --> 4724.659
really freaky

4726.679 --> 4731.6
but yeah also leading to that I'm

4729.14 --> 4734.0
absolutely not sure that well that thing

4731.6 --> 4735.860000000001
actually really happened and I think I

4734.0 --> 4737.6
brought that up

4735.86 --> 4741.259999999999
sometimes I don't want to talk about it

4737.6 --> 4744.1990000000005
again right but I was kind of like well

4741.26 --> 4747.56
trying to connect that up with people

4744.199 --> 4750.139999999999
so I might have well roused some

4747.56 --> 4752.659000000001
suspicion like is this some weirdo dark

4750.14 --> 4755.3
infiltrator because it almost felt like

4752.659 --> 4758.0
that to me I just didn't intend to be

4755.3 --> 4763.12
that but I was still carrying something

4758.0 --> 4763.12
inside and looking for help with that

4764.36 --> 4769.159
right

4766.219 --> 4772.159
but despite all that I still think that

4769.159 --> 4775.5199999999995
Jaron was just a complete dick

4772.159 --> 4778.099999999999
like he was apathetic

4775.52 --> 4781.400000000001
as in like I don't care and then

4778.1 --> 4783.02
literally feeling absolutely nothing

4781.4 --> 4785.48
about that

4783.02 --> 4788.179
just like oh turn it off

4785.48 --> 4790.759999999999
and I can feel that I'm an empath and I

4788.179 --> 4792.1990000000005
can feel it with everybody not just the

4790.76 --> 4794.719
people that I know

4792.199 --> 4797.659
I can feel it with people I just bump

4794.719 --> 4801.32
into I can get people's entire life

4797.659 --> 4804.739
story through spiritual metadata

4801.32 --> 4807.88
the second I bump into them and just

4804.739 --> 4812.62
having like a 30 second conversation

4807.88 --> 4812.62
that [ __ ] happens to me all the time

4813.38 --> 4818.12
it's also the reason why I'm not a great

4815.6 --> 4823.0
fan of of constantly meeting new people

4818.12 --> 4823.0
because I get too much info from that

4825.199 --> 4827.739
what

4828.02 --> 4834.92
what happened did you have it did I

4832.28 --> 4837.62
change man well you obviously haven't

4834.92 --> 4839.9
kept track of the Flat Earth early bird

4837.62 --> 4842.179
show and flatter talks

4839.9 --> 4845.92
did I have a vision dude I had an

4842.179 --> 4845.92
80-year lasting vision

4846.14 --> 4853.64
and it was almost all torture

4850.4 --> 4855.879999999999
terrible things things that I got to

4853.64 --> 4855.88
witness

4856.34 --> 4861.7390000000005
of other people

4858.56 --> 4865.159000000001
other people and Savage and evil things

4861.739 --> 4868.04
that they did and it was imposed unto me

4865.159 --> 4870.799999999999
through that experience that it was me

4868.04 --> 4873.32
doing that even though it could not ever

4870.8 --> 4876.02
have been me doing that

4873.32 --> 4877.639999999999
yeah torture a lot of it

4876.02 --> 4880.6
why

4877.64 --> 4880.6
to know

4880.94 --> 4886.94
it's a it was a crazy Endeavor that that

4883.94 --> 4889.58
caused part of that crazy the decisions

4886.94 --> 4891.739
that I made as kind of like a wizard

4889.58 --> 4897.219
back then and I'm talking like when I'm

4891.739 --> 4897.218999999999
freaking 17 yeah 17 Crazy

4898.219 --> 4903.02
I took things on my shoulder that were

4900.62 --> 4905.599999999999
absolutely insane

4903.02 --> 4908.5
and sometimes I think it's a miracle

4905.6 --> 4908.5
that I'm even alive

4911.78 --> 4917.32
but yeah I wanted to know evil without

4917.6 --> 4923.42
actually becoming evil

4920.179 --> 4926.179
to battle evil and so I was kind of

4923.42 --> 4928.9400000000005
forced into the skin of evil people to

4926.179 --> 4931.4
experience it from their perspective and

4928.94 --> 4934.0599999999995
their feelings

4931.4 --> 4938.0
or lack thereof

4934.06 --> 4940.400000000001
a lot of it

4938.0 --> 4943.48
too many people

4940.4 --> 4943.48
too many people

4943.82 --> 4948.32
some of which I'll never even know who

4946.1 --> 4951.5
they are

4948.32 --> 4954.08
but some actually kind of

4951.5 --> 4957.679
the high profile people that I recognize

4954.08 --> 4961.659
later like I know that I've seen through

4957.679 --> 4961.659
that guy's eyes right there

4962.31 --> 4966.38
[Music]

4964.52 --> 4968.179
but yeah

4966.38 --> 4970.04
all of that pretty much happened and

4968.179 --> 4973.46
when I was 17.

4970.04 --> 4976.5199999999995
but as a conscious experience it seems

4973.46 --> 4979.28
to have lasted like 80 years

4976.52 --> 4982.1
when I came out of it it was almost like

4979.28 --> 4984.0199999999995
a Narnia experience in that sense

4982.1 --> 4986.179
right and that was way before I even

4984.02 --> 4988.820000000001
heard of Narnia

4986.179 --> 4992.2390000000005
but yeah

4988.82 --> 4995.48
I didn't grow old in it

4992.239 --> 4997.699
but my spirit get got very overburdened

4995.48 --> 5000.82
and tired and cranky

4997.699 --> 5003.639999999999
and it seems like ice it's still there

5000.82 --> 5005.98
because it's just all that time that has

5003.64 --> 5007.92
passed through my spirit even though it

5005.98 --> 5011.099999999999
didn't pass through me in the physical

5007.92 --> 5011.1
time-based world

5028.3 --> 5034.360000000001
it's weird by the way because there were

5030.76 --> 5038.34
also people that did that apparently

5034.36 --> 5038.339999999999
having like lifetime vacations

5038.5 --> 5044.5
so it was actually very narnian

5042.1 --> 5048.159000000001
like how that worked in the Narnia book

5044.5 --> 5050.14
like you go there and then you let you

5048.159 --> 5052.9
stay there for like 20 years

5050.14 --> 5054.76
and then you go back and it's literally

5052.9 --> 5057.699
the moment you entered you got get out

5054.76 --> 5061.719
and you're still that age it's very

5057.699 --> 5064.299999999999
reminiscent of my experience

5061.719 --> 5067.36
not that I physically entered anything

5064.3 --> 5068.7390000000005
because what basically happened is

5067.36 --> 5071.799999999999
drugs

5068.739 --> 5074.259999999999
I didn't even know what it was

5071.8 --> 5077.320000000001
I then enter the other dimension and

5074.26 --> 5080.860000000001
that is where everything would happen

5077.32 --> 5084.159
a lot of it even dreams within dreams

5080.86 --> 5086.679
where I would take more drugs in the

5084.159 --> 5090.46
other dimension in the spirit Dimension

5086.679 --> 5093.52
to then enter another sub Realm

5090.46 --> 5096.699
that sort of [ __ ]

5093.52 --> 5098.9800000000005
and now think of that setup

5096.699 --> 5102.36
80 years

5098.98 --> 5103.9
it's crazy and it was

5102.36 --> 5107.5599999999995
terrifying

5103.9 --> 5110.679
and extremely depressing at the end I

5107.56 --> 5112.84
mean when I came out of that I was like

5110.679 --> 5115.2390000000005
depressed for years

5112.84 --> 5118.08
because of something that physically

5115.239 --> 5118.08
never even happened

5121.239 --> 5126.759999999999
right as soon as it started to

5124.3 --> 5130.0
weigh on me what had actually happened

5126.76 --> 5131.9800000000005
and that it's not just a basic dream or

5130.0 --> 5135.46
a dream that goes away

5131.98 --> 5138.9
fleetingly that things had been etched

5135.46 --> 5138.9
on my very spirit

5139.6 --> 5143.1
through my own decisions

5144.58 --> 5150.36
what kind of drugs well if I really knew

5146.92 --> 5150.36
I'd I'd never tell anybody

5150.4 --> 5155.28
but it was iOS got related

5155.38 --> 5160.84
like whatever that guy did he was like

5158.5 --> 5165.1
being all chemist about it

5160.84 --> 5169.96
guy a 17 year old kid

5165.1 --> 5169.96
oh sorry I I mean 15.

5172.12 --> 5179.0199999999995
crazy totally insane

5175.78 --> 5181.239
if any of that was possible

5179.02 --> 5184.1990000000005
totally insane

5181.239 --> 5184.199
but uh

5190.32 --> 5197.0199999999995
DMT no it was no t

5194.26 --> 5200.4400000000005
it's literally a little platter

5197.02 --> 5202.679
with some weird goo in there just like a

5200.44 --> 5202.678999999999
gel

5209.02 --> 5213.820000000001
I've seen it a lot in the dark world

5211.42 --> 5216.12
like it's a standard thing in the Dark

5213.82 --> 5219.34
World apparently

5216.12 --> 5220.78
Spirits do that too even like spirits

5219.34 --> 5223.12
that don't even have a physical body

5220.78 --> 5228.12
it's so weird man

5223.12 --> 5228.12
that whole dimension is so weird

5231.94 --> 5237.46
there's like an entire ecology there and

5235.48 --> 5239.739
I don't understand it I still don't

5237.46 --> 5241.36
understand it

5239.739 --> 5242.919999999999
I can

5241.36 --> 5245.32
see it

5242.92 --> 5249.1
but I don't understand why it is that

5245.32 --> 5251.44
way and that's like

5249.1 --> 5254.1
I don't know if I could ever truly

5251.44 --> 5254.099999999999
figure that out

5255.34 --> 5262.12
[Music]

5260.91 --> 5264.719
[Applause]

5262.12 --> 5264.719
anyway

5280.42 --> 5287.159
so I read a book about it once too

5283.26 --> 5289.6
right well the like in a literal ecology

5287.159 --> 5291.699
I'm not sure

5289.6 --> 5293.26
it's so strange

5291.699 --> 5295.419999999999
like there's still a lot of

5293.26 --> 5297.52
uncertainties about that other dimension

5295.42 --> 5300.219
and what is actually real about it and

5297.52 --> 5302.620000000001
what that really implies like how is it

5300.219 --> 5304.719
real what is real about it are there

5302.62 --> 5307.54
things durable or is it literally within

5304.719 --> 5312.659
that dream summoning

5307.54 --> 5312.659
that it is temporarily real it's

5317.08 --> 5321.489
complicated

5317.97 --> 5321.4890000000005
[Music]

5339.219 --> 5342.76
I have not done anything seeking star

5341.739 --> 5344.82
water

5342.76 --> 5348.1
and it wasn't like

5344.82 --> 5350.799999999999
gelatinous gel it was just a little like

5348.1 --> 5353.02
stuff

5350.8 --> 5356.62
like a little gooey

5353.02 --> 5358.540000000001
but not like like a gelatinous gel or

5356.62 --> 5360.34
anything not like that

5358.54 --> 5362.699
I mean I'm pretty sure he knew what he

5360.34 --> 5362.6990000000005
was doing

5366.639 --> 5371.08
I don't even know how to do it I don't

5368.62 --> 5372.76
even want to do it I'm not going back to

5371.08 --> 5376.0599999999995
the Dark World

5372.76 --> 5379.360000000001
I already literally already

5376.06 --> 5381.76
faced the man in Black

5379.36 --> 5384.219
like what I thought originally was God

5381.76 --> 5386.679
it doesn't look like a man in black suit

5384.219 --> 5390.639
type figure like the movie

5386.679 --> 5392.679
but a persistent figure that was like a

5390.639 --> 5395.28
representative in a way that I

5392.679 --> 5395.28
interacted with

5395.44 --> 5402.339999999999
that at some point said you've there's

5399.1 --> 5405.400000000001
nothing more I can show you

5402.34 --> 5406.42
I literally remember hearing that being

5405.4 --> 5409.299999999999
said

5406.42 --> 5410.92
in

5409.3 --> 5413.92
what was it

5410.92 --> 5413.92
2012.

5415.6 --> 5419.320000000001
yeah and even didn't even use anything

5418.06 --> 5423.04
then

5419.32 --> 5427.239
yeah I haven't actually used any of that

5423.04 --> 5430.06
since 97 and well also one time because

5427.239 --> 5433.48
somebody's some [ __ ] [ __ ]

5430.06 --> 5435.6990000000005
poisoned me with it in a bar somebody

5433.48 --> 5437.919999999999
behind the bar thought it was funny to

5435.699 --> 5441.159
put that [ __ ] in my drink when I was

5437.92 --> 5444.659
deeply in mourning in that moment was I

5441.159 --> 5444.659
mean that guy should die

5445.3 --> 5451.659000000001
that guy was like an actual satanic

5448.12 --> 5453.88
scumbag that should die

5451.659 --> 5455.92
yeah people that do that should kill

5453.88 --> 5460.32
themselves

5455.92 --> 5460.32
or like be run over by a truck

5460.42 --> 5465.34
right but that was the last time that I

5462.52 --> 5467.139
ever even remotely got in yeah

5465.34 --> 5470.62
physically involved with that substance

5467.139 --> 5472.659000000001
but most of it all come came from 97 and

5470.62 --> 5475.659
then after that moment there were so

5472.659 --> 5478.42
many Echoes of it that it would just

5475.659 --> 5480.4
arrive it's just like oh here we go

5478.42 --> 5483.46
again

5480.4 --> 5485.739
portals back open and like oh instead of

5483.46 --> 5487.36
just having a regular boring dream in

5485.739 --> 5489.879999999999
the next day suddenly there's this

5487.36 --> 5493.089999999999
entire event unrolling

5489.88 --> 5493.09
[Music]

5493.96 --> 5497.08
and then the next day I wake up and it's

5496.239 --> 5500.44
like

5497.08 --> 5502.54
wow it feels like I've been on a vague

5500.44 --> 5505.919999999999
on like a week

5502.54 --> 5505.92
vacation or something

5506.08 --> 5512.08
but I did not use anything

5510.28 --> 5514.96
for that

5512.08 --> 5517.36
it would just start to happen like

5514.96 --> 5518.26
attention growing and then it's just

5517.36 --> 5520.42
like

5518.26 --> 5522.1
you feel under this weird tension and

5520.42 --> 5523.96
some people then start drinking right

5522.1 --> 5526.4800000000005
they start breaking their system to

5523.96 --> 5529.42
stabilize it back and get sick and all

5526.48 --> 5532.36
that kind of [ __ ] or

5529.42 --> 5534.82
you let that tension actually tighten up

5532.36 --> 5536.86
and then it can be a moment if you have

5534.82 --> 5538.9
that capability if your pineal gland is

5536.86 --> 5541.139
good that you'll just snap Into the Dark

5538.9 --> 5541.138999999999
World

5542.56 --> 5548.139
but it's accompanied by that tension

5545.02 --> 5552.2390000000005
that tension you feel inside usually

5548.139 --> 5552.2390000000005
like more at on your neck

5553.06 --> 5559.5
right I didn't use anything for most of

5556.659 --> 5559.5
these experiences

5560.56 --> 5565.4800000000005
but I think that the way Ayahuasca when

5562.659 --> 5570.0599999999995
it was 17 did actually kind of trigger

5565.48 --> 5570.0599999999995
that effect from then happening

5571.47 --> 5575.7390000000005
[Music]

5573.159 --> 5578.5
but yeah even when I was younger I had

5575.739 --> 5582.04
those types of visions

5578.5 --> 5584.38
it was like extra time in between and I

5582.04 --> 5586.659
never even told anybody but I had whole

5584.38 --> 5588.9400000000005
Adventures I had

5586.659 --> 5590.739
Dark World Vision type dreams when they

5588.94 --> 5593.5599999999995
didn't even know what that was where I

5590.739 --> 5596.339999999999
would literally be a cat burglar in my

5593.56 --> 5596.34
in my town

5596.44 --> 5603.159
and literally crawl up people's

5600.4 --> 5606.58
houses and [ __ ]

5603.159 --> 5608.739
and they'd get very agitated eventually

5606.58 --> 5610.6
if they found out because that still

5608.739 --> 5613.239
happened there

5610.6 --> 5615.280000000001
and then I would like yeah run away or

5613.239 --> 5619.178999999999
whatever but

5615.28 --> 5622.12
nobody ever actually has

5619.179 --> 5625.78
seen me physically do that I've never

5622.12 --> 5627.46
like was police after me for that sort

5625.78 --> 5630.699
of thing ever

5627.46 --> 5633.4
because those things didn't actually

5630.699 --> 5635.379999999999
physically happen but I have very

5633.4 --> 5639.099999999999
detailed memories of how I was doing

5635.38 --> 5640.78
that even now of even like how it felt

5639.1 --> 5644.02
to

5640.78 --> 5645.94
like the the coldness of the tiles of

5644.02 --> 5648.34
the roof on my hands

5645.94 --> 5651.5199999999995
that sort of feeling I still remember

5648.34 --> 5656.639
that from dreams

5651.52 --> 5656.639
when I was like eight or ten

5656.679 --> 5661.12
and I didn't even know that that wasn't

5658.9 --> 5662.92
actually physically happening as far as

5661.12 --> 5664.78
I was concerned I really thought that

5662.92 --> 5665.679
happened and then the next day I would

5664.78 --> 5668.4
wonder

5665.679 --> 5668.4
like

5668.679 --> 5673.4800000000005
I want to go back there and then I would

5671.739 --> 5676.0
try to go back there

5673.48 --> 5678.099999999999
and then it's like wait there's

5676.0 --> 5680.52
something wrong here it's like this is

5678.1 --> 5682.719
not what it was like it was different

5680.52 --> 5684.580000000001
there's there's things different what's

5682.719 --> 5686.139
going on here this is not this this is

5684.58 --> 5688.36
the same location but things look

5686.139 --> 5691.32
different how can that be it would be

5688.36 --> 5691.32
really weirded out

5692.5 --> 5698.98
anyway

5694.9 --> 5702.219
so yeah don't don't get in that [ __ ] I

5698.98 --> 5704.44
mean it I'm making it sound perhaps very

5702.219 --> 5706.9
fascinating and appealing

5704.44 --> 5710.379999999999
but I'd like to remember you how I

5706.9 --> 5713.799999999999
started out this subject 80 years of

5710.38 --> 5713.8
hell yeah

5714.4 --> 5719.08
hell

5716.44 --> 5721.44
and when I say hell I mean an actual

5719.08 --> 5725.639
hell I mean

5721.44 --> 5729.419999999999
discomfort pain torture

5725.639 --> 5729.42
monstrous decisions

5731.08 --> 5736.36
right that sort of thing

5733.719 --> 5738.04
and then without protection without you

5736.36 --> 5741.219
being like Oh I'm going to ignore it

5738.04 --> 5744.159
because I can just move on yeah yeah how

5741.219 --> 5746.44
about it's really directly in your face

5744.159 --> 5750.0599999999995
you can't suppress your feelings and it

5746.44 --> 5750.0599999999995
lasts 80 years

5750.34 --> 5753.06
hmm

5761.15 --> 5767.159
[Music]

5763.44 --> 5767.159
don't recommend it

5773.8 --> 5777.0
don't do drugs

5777.28 --> 5782.86
especially those types

5779.679 --> 5786.42
unless you're really for a very serious

5782.86 --> 5786.42
challenge you got a good guiding

5787.3 --> 5793.179
you got proper wise parents or

5790.12 --> 5795.5199999999995
grandparents that will know they have to

5793.179 --> 5797.62
know about these things before you even

5795.52 --> 5800.7390000000005
try it out

5797.62 --> 5802.84
never ever try to do this sort of [ __ ]

5800.739 --> 5806.919999999999
completely secretly on your own

5802.84 --> 5808.54
initiative never ever do that

5806.92 --> 5811.659
you have to

5808.54 --> 5815.86
always do it with wise people present

5811.659 --> 5818.98
always otherwise you may absolutely Doom

5815.86 --> 5821.739
yourself and come out of it like a

5818.98 --> 5824.919999999999
madman a raving madman that'll never

5821.739 --> 5826.599999999999
restore yeah that can happen to you too

5824.92 --> 5828.1
if you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

5826.6 --> 5831.6990000000005
doing with these types of substances

5828.1 --> 5834.400000000001
yeah it's extremely dangerous can

5831.699 --> 5837.94
anybody that recommends that [ __ ] per

5834.4 --> 5840.339999999999
default like it's candy is a criminal I

5837.94 --> 5842.32
don't even care if that's legal it's

5840.34 --> 5846.9400000000005
criminal to do that

5842.32 --> 5849.94
because the impact it has is

5846.94 --> 5849.94
uncontrollable

5851.56 --> 5854.56
foreign

5858.639 --> 5861.0
foreign

5862.719 --> 5866.159
no more drugs good

5882.1 --> 5887.8
did I ever see any Spade of Unsolved cat

5885.219 --> 5888.94
burglaries

5887.8 --> 5892.5
no

5888.94 --> 5892.5
I was just a little kid

5902.08 --> 5905.98
I mean I don't think they physically

5903.82 --> 5908.38
actually happen I might have entered

5905.98 --> 5909.82
their dream world and been a cat burglar

5908.38 --> 5911.7390000000005
in their dream

5909.82 --> 5914.08
in their dream house

5911.739 --> 5917.678999999999
right that might have happened

5914.08 --> 5921.639
but I don't think I've ever actually

5917.679 --> 5924.179
like astrally projected a real thing to

5921.639 --> 5924.179
do something

5924.58 --> 5928.54
I don't think that's ever happened or

5926.739 --> 5931.36
well not that

5928.54 --> 5933.219
I've ever been able to prove let's just

5931.36 --> 5936.0599999999995
say it like that I mean a lot of weird

5933.219 --> 5936.06
[ __ ] has happened

5938.56 --> 5941.1
anyway

5945.46 --> 5950.26
what the [ __ ] are you talking about Thor

5947.92 --> 5953.04
Casey

5950.26 --> 5953.04
no

5953.4 --> 5956.679
decriminalization you know what that

5955.42 --> 5958.54
means

5956.679 --> 5961.719
that means

5958.54 --> 5962.98
that includes like commercial exploit

5961.719 --> 5965.44
yeah

5962.98 --> 5968.199
that means it's going to be turned into

5965.44 --> 5971.08
some kind of a party drug

5968.199 --> 5975.099999999999
that should never happen

5971.08 --> 5977.8
yeah things like DMT Ayahuasca should be

5975.1 --> 5980.7390000000005
like

5977.8 --> 5983.860000000001
well not like oh you immediately go to

5980.739 --> 5985.199
jail if you have any of that

5983.86 --> 5989.259999999999
but

5985.199 --> 5992.259999999999
you should just not be

5989.26 --> 5995.5
allowed to do it unless you have like

5992.26 --> 5998.02
proper low credentials to prove that you

5995.5 --> 6001.02
could that you even realize the

5998.02 --> 6003.3
challenge of it how about that

6001.02 --> 6005.400000000001
how about you need just some proof that

6003.3 --> 6007.860000000001
you're responsible enough even to

6005.4 --> 6010.58
attempt such a thing

6007.86 --> 6010.58
how about that

6012.6 --> 6018.3
no so I do not like decriminalization it

6015.719 --> 6020.88
doesn't mean that

6018.3 --> 6024.4800000000005
you should literally just

6020.88 --> 6026.219
turn it into like a crime situation in

6024.48 --> 6028.678999999999
general I mean I am kind of for

6026.219 --> 6032.58
decriminalizing drugs

6028.679 --> 6035.34
but this is not a drug this is not party

6032.58 --> 6038.36
[ __ ] this is not Amusement yeah this is

6035.34 --> 6038.360000000001
[ __ ] dangerous

6041.82 --> 6045.679
so

6043.56 --> 6045.679
no

6046.139 --> 6051.84
if anything

6048.06 --> 6053.52
it should like become illegal to even

6051.84 --> 6056.82
reference it

6053.52 --> 6059.1
will not know you get a fine but it

6056.82 --> 6061.0199999999995
should be like systematically avoided to

6059.1 --> 6062.58
bring it up it's not something that

6061.02 --> 6065.1
should be common

6062.58 --> 6067.5
con like common knowledge

6065.1 --> 6071.159000000001
it's not good for people

6067.5 --> 6075.3
the potential for Dangerous outcomes are

6071.159 --> 6077.46
higher than for positive outcomes if you

6075.3 --> 6078.96
just throw it out there

6077.46 --> 6081.44
yeah

6078.96 --> 6081.44
don't

6083.28 --> 6088.0199999999995
it should be there for those that have a

6086.4 --> 6091.099999999999
natural calling and that are very

6088.02 --> 6094.139
curious in nature a very talented

6091.1 --> 6097.4400000000005
and wise about it

6094.139 --> 6101.0
it should not be like you should not be

6097.44 --> 6101.0
allowed to advertise it

6101.34 --> 6109.56
or to like just sell it openly

6104.219 --> 6109.56
commercially that's just no no

6112.02 --> 6115.219
never do that

6116.99 --> 6121.489
[Music]

6126.78 --> 6129.978999999999
[Music]

6131.34 --> 6137.2390000000005
that's right a Como virus psychedelics

6133.92 --> 6137.2390000000005
are not for the weak-minded

6156.719 --> 6162.36
yeah good point guardzilla

6159.78 --> 6164.46
anyway I don't know how the subject

6162.36 --> 6167.0
ended up on this

6164.46 --> 6167.0
did I guess

6167.46 --> 6169.699
I guess

6176.699 --> 6179.699
foreign

6193.639 --> 6199.38
yeah that happens

6195.719 --> 6201.42
I mean that's the algorithm

6199.38 --> 6204.119
oh you're you're looking for something

6201.42 --> 6206.6990000000005
well that must mean that you now want

6204.119 --> 6209.759999999999
everything about that right that's what

6206.699 --> 6212.28
they do it's kind of primitive though

6209.76 --> 6215.159000000001
and I'm excited I would think that it

6212.28 --> 6217.92
would be a little dance than that by now

6215.159 --> 6220.86
because in general just throwing

6217.92 --> 6223.86
advertisement a lot about something that

6220.86 --> 6227.179
has been just registered is not exactly

6223.86 --> 6227.179
effective I'd say

6228.36 --> 6232.58
what's going on YouTube stalling

6237.36 --> 6240.32
foreign

6251.28 --> 6256.5199999999995
it should

6253.38 --> 6259.649
I hope my sound is okay

6256.52 --> 6259.649
[Music]

6265.98 --> 6272.4
yeah since man I've I've seen that it's

6268.86 --> 6276.739
totally inconsequential though I mean

6272.4 --> 6276.739
oh it's a dying organization

6278.88 --> 6285.619
it's going to be over very soon

6281.4 --> 6285.619
and I mean very soon

6292.199 --> 6296.299999999999
I mean pretty much the entire scam has

6295.26 --> 6299.159000000001
been called

6296.3 --> 6301.56
recognized and is being called out now

6299.159 --> 6303.0599999999995
on a daily basis

6301.56 --> 6305.820000000001
it's

6303.06 --> 6307.7390000000005
yeah it it will keep pretending like

6305.82 --> 6310.0199999999995
it's in control and [ __ ]

6307.739 --> 6314.699
when it's just not gonna last

6310.02 --> 6317.040000000001
because everybody now sees the scam this

6314.699 --> 6319.638999999999
is not gonna put the Humpty Dumpty back

6317.04 --> 6319.639
together again

6320.46 --> 6327.3
anyway

6322.46 --> 6327.3
[Music]

6329.4 --> 6334.98
yeah I think I'm gonna round out to show

6332.49 --> 6338.0599999999995
