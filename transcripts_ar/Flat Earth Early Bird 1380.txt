super hard

112.86 --> 117.899
like a lot

115.68 --> 120.47900000000001
like buckets coming out of the sky but

117.899 --> 124.2
yeah that didn't last very long

120.479 --> 128.94
so now it's kind of like this

124.2 --> 134.36
a bunch of clouds various sizes and

128.94 --> 134.35999999999999

174.54 --> 179.94
for me as well

176.94 --> 183.5
anyway hello Scott first in chat slum

179.94 --> 183.5
buggy good to see you

187.39 --> 193.44
[Music]

190.159 --> 196.019
are you all doing

193.44 --> 199.68
yeah yesterday's show early bird show

196.019 --> 202.08
was cut short because of a

199.68 --> 204.239
meeting that apparently yeah I did know

202.08 --> 207.9
it was like it was going to be in the

204.239 --> 211.379
middle of my show so I was kind of like

207.9 --> 213.659
caught off the guard there a bit

211.379 --> 216.0
they just said it was going to be Friday

213.659 --> 216.78
somewhere I didn't know it was going to

216.0 --> 219.239
be

216.78 --> 222.239
like at two o'clock

219.239 --> 225.959
nobody informed me about that but yeah

222.239 --> 228.78
the meeting did go fine I was kind of

225.959 --> 230.34
silent most of the time anyway

228.78 --> 232.86
uh

230.34 --> 235.5
we didn't really like flame up out of

232.86 --> 236.58
control or anything and

235.5 --> 238.98
yeah

236.58 --> 242.60000000000002
it was fine

238.98 --> 242.6
[Music]

245.519 --> 250.5
I was in a way a bit boring I mean my

248.34 --> 251.879
landlord seemed like he was pretty

250.5 --> 255.48
nervous

251.879 --> 257.779
just about the situation with the

255.48 --> 260.979
power cost and all that

257.779 --> 260.979
[Music]

263.52 --> 265.82
right

266.1 --> 270.84000000000003
so yeah because of that yesterday was a

268.44 --> 273.479
short show and yeah I wasn't really too

270.84 --> 275.34
much great mood anyway but it's because

273.479 --> 277.74
of the nerves

275.34 --> 280.19899999999996
of what could have happened and it

277.74 --> 282.06
wasn't really all that bad anyway so

280.199 --> 285.18
today

282.06 --> 287.6
yeah there's like a handyman coming in

285.18 --> 287.6
two hours

289.199 --> 294.06
yeah landlord sent one over to install

292.139 --> 296.82
the new vent

294.06 --> 298.97
in the kitchen

296.82 --> 301.08
foreign

298.97 --> 304.02000000000004
[Music]

301.08 --> 308.58
so yeah I can't really do a super long

304.02 --> 311.18
show but I can do a full two-hour show

308.58 --> 311.18
right

311.34 --> 315.59999999999997
anyway

312.78 --> 319.73999999999995
yesterday's letters debates

315.6 --> 321.72
was the longest after show I've ever

319.74 --> 326.36
witnessed

321.72 --> 326.36
I think in total it was like six hours

326.58 --> 330.419
it went past like

328.8 --> 332.40000000000003
eight o'clock

330.419 --> 334.919
crazy

332.4 --> 337.25899999999996
but it was really interesting and people

334.919 --> 338.94
had a lot of cohesion and energy and

337.259 --> 342.0
even patience

338.94 --> 343.979
so it was a really great show very

342.0 --> 346.22
interesting and a couple of good moments

343.979 --> 346.21999999999997
myself

347.639 --> 350.82
really looking forward to watching that

349.5 --> 353.28
back

350.82 --> 356.24
whenever it's gonna play hopefully

353.28 --> 356.23999999999995
Sunday somewhere

356.28 --> 360.55999999999995
but Jesus that was a long show

361.35 --> 364.53900000000004
[Music]

366.0 --> 370.82
it was kind of funny because we were

367.919 --> 370.82
talking also about

374.94 --> 377.94
fireworks

379.139 --> 385.86
also about just the the Big Bang

383.34 --> 389.34
and Elijah inquiring

385.86 --> 392.94
about it and then me and Adam

389.34 --> 395.15999999999997
like really trying to explain what what

392.94 --> 397.62
it is supposed to be and all that that

395.16 --> 400.94
took quite some time it was a really

397.62 --> 400.94
interesting segment to do

406.259 --> 410.22
so yeah that was pretty cool yesterday

408.6 --> 413.66
was

410.22 --> 413.66
a good day overall

431.52 --> 434.52
goody

435.0 --> 442.16
foreign

436.84 --> 445.5
[Music]

442.16 --> 448.09900000000005
also yes they had like a

445.5 --> 451.28
I ate a lot

448.099 --> 451.28
a lot

452.4 --> 457.25899999999996
so

454.8 --> 459.18
yeah it was kind of heavy on the on the

457.259 --> 462.84000000000003
stomach a bit

459.18 --> 465.90000000000003
but was all good

462.84 --> 468.84
I do think that it it really boosted my

465.9 --> 471.17999999999995
uh my regenerative system I'd like a

468.84 --> 474.23999999999995
chicken broccoli

471.18 --> 476.759
and the butter was relative it was fresh

474.24 --> 479.72
right

476.759 --> 479.72
seriously

482.759 --> 485.47900000000004
ah

488.099 --> 493.139
and then a corn cob too

490.8 --> 494.759
on top of that and french fries earlier

493.139 --> 496.86
so yeah

494.759 --> 501.539
a total full

496.86 --> 505.68
meal and I needed that

501.539 --> 507.539
jukaku said that we get an image of Big

505.68 --> 513.0600000000001
Bang

507.539 --> 515.7189999999999
I'll see unbiblical cord attached

513.06 --> 515.7189999999999
umbilical cord

515.799 --> 518.9789999999999
[Music]

521.64 --> 527.279
that's hilarious

524.099 --> 529.74
I mean I get it supposed to be like the

527.279 --> 534.54
Galaxy was sort of lobbed out of the Big

529.74 --> 536.88
Bang but an umbilical cord what

534.54 --> 540.92
that is a weird thing

536.88 --> 540.92
I mean it's it's kind of creative though

542.339 --> 545.72
a lva pull

547.24 --> 553.26
[Music]

551.339 --> 554.0400000000001
yeah I'll be able to watch some of that

yesterday

554.96 --> 560.279
[Music]

556.8 --> 562.0799999999999
I recognize a couple of people

560.279 --> 565.14
yeah

562.08 --> 568.7
that hang around with you

565.14 --> 568.6999999999999
or like on the show there

569.36 --> 573.32
apgc net good to see you

574.76 --> 580.3199999999999
yeah mostly recognize Travis

578.339 --> 584.12
and

580.32 --> 584.12
he's like one of the guys there

584.399 --> 589.98
it's probably just voice similarity but

587.339 --> 591.6600000000001
it just reminds me a lot about somebody

589.98 --> 595.279
else that it just

591.66 --> 595.279
he sounds really familiar

596.519 --> 602.72
and also the way he talks it kind of

598.56 --> 602.7199999999999
reminds me of the guys over at uh

604.5 --> 610.09
iron realm media

606.89 --> 610.09
[Music]

610.92 --> 613.5799999999999
think

613.62 --> 619.4590000000001
yeah a bit it's probably not the same

615.899 --> 619.459
guy but uh

621.6 --> 626.7
yeah it's it's taking some time for me

624.48 --> 629.58
to get used to your format basically

626.7 --> 632.779
because it's all

629.58 --> 632.779
really laid back

634.2 --> 640.38
but yeah interesting and at least you

637.86 --> 642.6
would know how to get people in there so

640.38 --> 644.9399999999999
that yeah

642.6 --> 647.64
can't wait to see that develop further

644.94 --> 651.0100000000001
lva poll uh

647.64 --> 656.019

677.94 --> 683.519
oh

680.339 --> 686.519
I think I completely missed that the

683.519 --> 688.68
flat side stream where Sean Hawkins was

686.519 --> 692.22
gonna go up against Brian Leakey

688.68 --> 694.3199999999999
I completely missed out on it

692.22 --> 697.14
so weird I remember like waiting for it

694.32 --> 698.22
and then I think I just went to do other

697.14 --> 701.779
things

698.22 --> 701.779
I just forgot about it

703.56 --> 709.04
didn't watch like Quantum of conch has

706.14 --> 709.04
another upload

709.44 --> 713.839

713.839 --> 719.7600000000001
meta analyzing his own

717.36 --> 722.82
thing what he's doing and also like

719.76 --> 725.399
backdrop intentions and it was very

722.82 --> 727.019
enlightening Quantum of conscious Dream

725.399 --> 729.68

1177.08 --> 1185.1999999999998
to change the entire perspective on

1180.26 --> 1185.2
things I highly highly doubt it

1185.419 --> 1190.3400000000001
I mean that moment already pretty much

1187.94 --> 1191.72
happened

1190.34 --> 1195.02
to me

1191.72 --> 1199.0
when yeah when I was there when wizard

1195.02 --> 1199.0
got on Nathan Oakley's

1200.059 --> 1207.3799999999999
I mean what more do I need to see

1203.9 --> 1210.26
I know how he works now like what that

1207.38 --> 1212.6000000000001
is that he's doing I wonder if he knows

1210.26 --> 1214.28
what he is doing but I know how that

1212.6 --> 1216.32
works what he's doing

1214.28 --> 1218.4189999999999
and I've described aspects about it

1216.32 --> 1219.86
right it's Ken wheeler method doing a

1218.419 --> 1221.8400000000001
wheelie

1219.86 --> 1225.08
scatter gunning

1221.84 --> 1226.6999999999998
like brooming together a bunch of

1225.08 --> 1228.799
analysis

1226.7 --> 1230.059
different things that are really not

1228.799 --> 1234.62
related

1230.059 --> 1237.52
and then claiming that that is ether

1234.62 --> 1237.52
that's it

1239.78 --> 1244.16
and then move on to the next thing and

1241.7 --> 1247.039
the next thing doing a wheelie so that's

1244.16 --> 1249.679
what I figured out

1247.039 --> 1251.96
that's when I named it described it and

1249.679 --> 1254.539
what more can I possibly learn from

1251.96 --> 1258.1000000000001
watching that stuff

1254.539 --> 1258.1
watching him blabber on more

1258.62 --> 1263.9599999999998
I mean I didn't need to watch like 10

1262.58 --> 1265.82
hours

1263.96 --> 1270.46
of Ken wheeler

1265.82 --> 1270.46
to figure out what it is that he does

1270.62 --> 1274.6999999999998
all together I may have seen like an

1272.96 --> 1277.88
hour max

1274.7 --> 1279.5
Snippets different videos segments just

1277.88 --> 1282.8200000000002
a couple of things

1279.5 --> 1282.82
what more do you need

1287.179 --> 1289.6000000000001
anyway

1289.82 --> 1295.34
Hawkins face

1291.86 --> 1299.299
you did not miss anything okay

1295.34 --> 1301.9399999999998
what was it about anyway

1299.299 --> 1304.46
get to summarize like the the topics

1301.94 --> 1308.559
that they hit

1304.46 --> 1308.559
that the Polaris challenge come up

1311.539 --> 1314.08
anyway

1323.059 --> 1326.799
hey cinch man good to see you

1330.17 --> 1339.73
[Music]

1346.039 --> 1348.7
foreign

1349.64 --> 1353.9
okay

1351.02 --> 1355.33
the man from SC that's

1353.9 --> 1369.88
that's crazy

1355.33 --> 1373.52
[Music]

1369.88 --> 1375.2600000000002
right also I was watching a bit of lift

1373.52 --> 1377.72
the Veil

1375.26 --> 1380.24
Nathan Stopman

1377.72 --> 1382.659
it's like

1380.24 --> 1382.659
yeah

1383.179 --> 1389.0590000000002
yeah it's I think he like he likes to

1386.36 --> 1392.08
dig out like weird interesting things

1389.059 --> 1396.6789999999999
and he's very hyped though

1392.08 --> 1398.6589999999999
he is also slight four born fear poor an

1396.679 --> 1400.3400000000001
addict let's say

1398.659 --> 1402.5590000000002
but I've been following for quite a

1400.34 --> 1404.059
while and it's yeah it still brings up

1402.559 --> 1406.7
interesting things and apparently

1404.059 --> 1409.1
there's this really creepy type of vax

1406.7 --> 1411.6200000000001
damage

1409.1 --> 1414.28
allegedly

1411.62 --> 1418.6399999999999
sake

1414.28 --> 1419.84
that makes people like turn their head

1418.64 --> 1422.48
around

1419.84 --> 1424.34
over to the right like somebody's

1422.48 --> 1428.84
talking to them and then they basically

1424.34 --> 1431.1789999999999
go [ __ ] and start to either like

1428.84 --> 1435.26
walk around

1431.179 --> 1437.96
their axis and fall over

1435.26 --> 1441.14
or you literally just fall over and just

1437.96 --> 1444.32
get all [ __ ] but it's like really

1441.14 --> 1446.0
creepy and he dug up this video of like

1444.32 --> 1449.6
a whole bunch of people going through

1446.0 --> 1453.26
that mostly well from what I could see

1449.6 --> 1455.84
black people and Asians

1453.26 --> 1457.7
Asians have a two a lot they have no

1455.84 --> 1461.059
idea from where so that's why I'm kind

1457.7 --> 1465.3400000000001
of over generalizing it was just like

1461.059 --> 1465.34
security cam videos and all that

1466.039 --> 1470.04
huh

1466.82 --> 1470.04
[Music]

1474.64 --> 1479.5990000000002
[Music]

1491.31 --> 1495.799
[Music]

1492.82 --> 1497.6589999999999
right that's a really [ __ ] up videos

1495.799 --> 1499.6399999999999
about that too I mean he was just

1497.659 --> 1501.98
playing that and one of these in one of

1499.64 --> 1503.7800000000002
these videos you yeah it was basically

1501.98 --> 1507.6200000000001
just a

1503.78 --> 1509.12
a death video because this guy

1507.62 --> 1512.08
at that effect

1509.12 --> 1515.8999999999999
right when he was next to a moving train

1512.08 --> 1517.76
at a train station and he literally just

1515.9 --> 1520.22
fell in

1517.76 --> 1523.36
the train rails as the train was good it

1520.22 --> 1523.3600000000001
was like dude

1524.299 --> 1528.4
so yeah that's not some LARP

1528.679 --> 1534.02
that was at somebody yeah literally died

1531.2 --> 1536.679
right in front of me there

1534.02 --> 1536.679
ugh

1538.039 --> 1540.94
messed up

1545.36 --> 1550.279
but it was really weird because just in

1548.659 --> 1553.8200000000002
all those videos it looked almost

1550.279 --> 1556.039
exactly the same and like metadata from

1553.82 --> 1556.6299999999999
what I could feel was the same it's like

1556.039 --> 1557.96
they got

1556.63 --> 1560.1200000000001
[Music]

1557.96 --> 1561.98
something like put their hand on their

1560.12 --> 1565.6589999999999
shoulder and they turn around and then

1561.98 --> 1565.659
they just like exit

1566.0 --> 1570.44
and something really bizarre takes over

1568.4 --> 1571.7
that basically makes them go completely

1570.44 --> 1574.92
[ __ ]

1571.7 --> 1574.92
[Music]

1575.36 --> 1581.7199999999998
like the Hand of Death is just touching

1578.24 --> 1584.5
them on the right shoulder or something

1581.72 --> 1584.5
creepy

1592.83 --> 1599.12
[Music]

1596.6 --> 1601.76
yeah Scott it was [ __ ] up man because

1599.12 --> 1604.52
that with that one like I saw it

1601.76 --> 1607.039
starting and I knew like oh no oh please

1604.52 --> 1611.48
let somebody just walk over there and

1607.039 --> 1615.02
pull him away but no everybody's just

1611.48 --> 1617.8600000000001
standing there like [ __ ] retards

1615.02 --> 1617.86
ugh

1620.0 --> 1624.98
I mean seriously if you see somebody

1622.159 --> 1627.44
like stumbling near a train

1624.98 --> 1630.02
you might want to kind of like try to

1627.44 --> 1633.38
walk over because what if they're like

1630.02 --> 1635.48
having a stroke or something

1633.38 --> 1638.419
and you gotta pull them away quickly

1635.48 --> 1640.76
when you notice that right I mean this

1638.419 --> 1644.179
is just basic

1640.76 --> 1647.919
Society skills

1644.179 --> 1647.919
that nobody's doing [ __ ]

1649.51 --> 1656.239
[Music]

1658.82 --> 1662.84
oh hello

1660.679 --> 1666.2
Master B

1662.84 --> 1668.9599999999998
just found about me

1666.2 --> 1673.279
found out about me this week okay

1668.96 --> 1676.4
ow through Flat Earth debate

1673.279 --> 1678.64
or where

1676.4 --> 1678.64
foreign

1685.48 --> 1689.14
no you're not new

1692.679 --> 1699.919
fairly new but it's not really that new

1695.6 --> 1703.12
I I remember you from like

1699.919 --> 1703.1200000000001
a year ago even

1703.159 --> 1705.7
anyway

1720.679 --> 1724.0600000000002
oh right

1722.72 --> 1734.819
right

1724.06 --> 1734.819
[Music]

1753.74 --> 1760.8990000000001
that's Debaters who changed that

1758.179 --> 1760.8990000000001
okay

1770.539 --> 1776.48
he's talking about Skype

1773.0 --> 1778.1
Skype room anyway

1776.48 --> 1779.6
uh

1778.1 --> 1781.039
hey

1779.6 --> 1783.9399999999998
yeah

1781.039 --> 1783.94
good to see you

1786.88 --> 1792.94
Brian changed the title you say

1790.279 --> 1792.94
okay

1798.44 --> 1802.24
ah yeah here I see it

1802.82 --> 1806.5
yesterday evening okay

1809.17 --> 1813.729
[Music]

1814.46 --> 1818.059
all right

1815.679 --> 1820.7
one hell of a show by the way yesterday

1818.059 --> 1823.76
wasn't it Adam making

1820.7 --> 1826.52
Flat Earth debate after show

1823.76 --> 1830.059
I mean the after show alone must have

1826.52 --> 1832.6589999999999
been like four hours or something

1830.059 --> 1832.6589999999999
incredible

1868.58 --> 1871.58
foreign

1872.78 --> 1875.97
[Music]

1878.23 --> 1881.289
[Music]

1891.37 --> 1896.3799999999999
[Music]

1892.419 --> 1896.38
yes inch man that's

1897.86 --> 1900.4599999999998
but

1904.1 --> 1909.4399999999998
science answer I mean it's not part of

1907.34 --> 1911.899
the official narrative though

1909.44 --> 1913.46
cinchman I mean this is where the things

1911.899 --> 1915.1399999999999
get really weird

1913.46 --> 1916.7
because like the official Globe

1915.14 --> 1920.48
narrative

1916.7 --> 1922.64
is basically just a

1920.48 --> 1925.34
openly broken story

1922.64 --> 1927.5
it is just a story it's the people that

1925.34 --> 1930.26
are making it into a religion saying

1927.5 --> 1932.96
like hey but wait this part isn't

1930.26 --> 1934.52
working so that can't be it it must be

1932.96 --> 1937.58
this

1934.52 --> 1939.679
but the main narrative doesn't actually

1937.58 --> 1943.059
do that

1939.679 --> 1943.0590000000002
it's really confusing

1944.779 --> 1949.64
in the main narrative there is Coriolis

1947.12 --> 1952.2199999999998
deviation it's not really disclaimed I

1949.64 --> 1954.94
mean even Neil deGrasse Tyson appeals to

1952.22 --> 1957.8600000000001
it when he's talking about the football

1954.94 --> 1960.0800000000002
deviating enough slightly

1957.86 --> 1961.1589999999999
because of coriolis in order to make the

1960.08 --> 1963.62
goal

1961.159 --> 1965.779
that's based on the official claim it's

1963.62 --> 1967.6399999999999
just they don't constantly talk about it

1965.779 --> 1969.2
or reference it because if people think

1967.64 --> 1971.1200000000001
about it too much

1969.2 --> 1972.98
then they'd see that things don't

1971.12 --> 1974.299
actually deviate because of choreo's

1972.98 --> 1976.3990000000001
deviation

1974.299 --> 1977.899
as it should as is claimed on the

1976.399 --> 1979.9399999999998
spinning ball Earth

1977.899 --> 1984.08
now of course there's anti-flat Earth

1979.94 --> 1988.159
solutions to this and me Baldwin

1984.08 --> 1991.6399999999999
part of me I also contribute to this

1988.159 --> 1994.159
by for example saying yeah but

1991.64 --> 1995.8400000000001
it's all relative

1994.159 --> 1998.659
so

1995.84 --> 2001.6589999999999
this idea of spinning and has all that

1998.659 --> 2003.7
these forces and all that when it's on a

2001.659 --> 2005.44
really large scale and there's a lot of

2003.7 --> 2007.539
gravity involved

2005.44 --> 2009.7
then

2007.539 --> 2012.7
suddenly it just becomes relative and

2009.7 --> 2014.919
it's like the mass makes it stationary

2012.7 --> 2017.74
really so we could be spinning

2014.919 --> 2020.38
incredibly fast even

2017.74 --> 2022.299
and it just wouldn't matter

2020.38 --> 2024.0390000000002
everything would just seem like it's

2022.299 --> 2027.94
stationary because it's all relative

2024.039 --> 2031.0
right it's it's like invoking

2027.94 --> 2033.88
A System's rule

2031.0 --> 2035.98
in order to be able to deal with the

2033.88 --> 2038.98
concept of

2035.98 --> 2041.679
spinning planets and all that

2038.98 --> 2042.76
which Earth is claimed to be

2041.679 --> 2046.3600000000001
and

2042.76 --> 2048.099
no longer needing to explain why on the

2046.36 --> 2050.679
actual Earth there is no coriolis

2048.099 --> 2053.619
deviation as you would normally have

2050.679 --> 2056.94
if you just applied regular mechanics

2053.619 --> 2056.94
you can't do that though

2057.22 --> 2061.72
or yeah if you want to make it into a

2060.099 --> 2063.8990000000003
religion where it's all real then you

2061.72 --> 2063.899
can't

2064.3 --> 2070.0600000000004
so I just say like yeah of course it's

2068.02 --> 2073.0
moving in lockstep but it's not actually

2070.06 --> 2076.179
moving in lockstep you see by saying

2073.0 --> 2078.879
like oh yeah but the Earth is saying the

2076.179 --> 2081.639
Earth is spinning is kind of like a

2078.879 --> 2083.02
metaphysical violation

2081.639 --> 2085.659
because

2083.02 --> 2088.599
because it's all relative in the massive

2085.659 --> 2090.339
amount of gravity the large planetary

2088.599 --> 2091.8990000000003
body of Earth

2090.339 --> 2095.2599999999998
right

2091.899 --> 2098.52
the Earth doesn't actually spin it's

2095.26 --> 2102.76
like caught in a gravity Vortex thingy

2098.52 --> 2105.46
and that causes the universe to spin in

2102.76 --> 2107.619
relation to the Earth

2105.46 --> 2110.28
and that's why we don't have coriolis

2107.619 --> 2110.28
deviation

2110.32 --> 2117.839
gravity just keeps it all

2114.22 --> 2120.64
like in a separated

2117.839 --> 2121.64
reference frame it's like space-time

2120.64 --> 2122.98
reference frame

2121.64 --> 2125.3799999999997
[Music]

2122.98 --> 2128.44
yeah I like that

2125.38 --> 2130.599
space-time reference frame

2128.44 --> 2132.099
separate space-time reference frame if a

2130.599 --> 2133.92
body is big enough then it doesn't

2132.099 --> 2136.42
really matter anymore if it's spinning

2133.92 --> 2139.78
it's not going to be subjected to

2136.42 --> 2142.3
regular forces in centripetal and all

2139.78 --> 2144.94
that right the bigger the body the less

2142.3 --> 2148.119
of that and it all just becomes relative

2144.94 --> 2150.16
and then you could conceive that

2148.119 --> 2152.5
there's like a balance to how big

2150.16 --> 2156.0989999999997
something is and how how or how much

2152.5 --> 2159.22
mass weight it has versus how fast it

2156.099 --> 2161.5
can spin in order to not be subjected to

2159.22 --> 2165.7599999999998
the regular spinning forces

2161.5 --> 2169.619
of regular normal masses

2165.76 --> 2169.619
yeah so here you go

2170.079 --> 2174.8390000000004
that's why we don't see coriolis

2172.3 --> 2174.8390000000004

2176.46 --> 2179.579
this is

2181.52 --> 2184.75
[Music]

2185.079 --> 2190.0
I mean like even two three years ago

2187.839 --> 2192.339
when I first kind of showed Baldwin on

2190.0 --> 2195.22
the stage when I back then even said

2192.339 --> 2197.92
like the ball can never be defeated

2195.22 --> 2201.8799999999997
that wasn't a joke

2197.92 --> 2204.359
I mean I can literally keep doing this

2201.88 --> 2204.359
forever

2204.91 --> 2209.92
[Music]

2206.68 --> 2212.68
it's just that I try to do it sparingly

2209.92 --> 2215.8
because there's really not too much in

2212.68 --> 2220.14
it for me other than just

2215.8 --> 2220.1400000000003
I like doing it and comedic value

2225.4 --> 2228.96
a little flatten the Curve

2244.359 --> 2250.2599999999998
let's see if meteors come up over the

2247.72 --> 2250.2599999999998
horizon yeah

2251.32 --> 2258.9
oh meteors falling stars right falling

2254.619 --> 2258.9
stars don't come up from the horizon

2260.859 --> 2266.7
they're always angled Down to Earth for

2264.339 --> 2266.7
some reason

2287.98 --> 2293.92
why are you talking about master B

2290.92 --> 2293.92
foreign

2298.68 --> 2305.68
they made more videos of

2301.78 --> 2310.02
some movie figure and then pasting my

2305.68 --> 2310.02
head over that oh they're so smart

2310.06 --> 2312.839
wow

2314.619 --> 2321.119
yeah that's sort of dude it's full of

2317.92 --> 2321.119
that sort of crap out there

2321.82 --> 2327.9
they they made videos like that even

2324.22 --> 2327.8999999999996
like four years ago

2331.18 --> 2334.66
thank you

2332.079 --> 2337.599
I mean all it's really gonna do is just

2334.66 --> 2340.54
make people wonder like why

2337.599 --> 2342.46
did they take this guy's head and and

2340.54 --> 2344.88
put it on there like what the hell did

2342.46 --> 2344.88
he do

2344.98 --> 2349.66
to be so hated by you

2347.44 --> 2352.78
I think that's really the thing that it

2349.66 --> 2355.72
will do it will just be like whoa

2352.78 --> 2359.3390000000004
that guy for some reason must really get

2355.72 --> 2359.339
under these people's fingernails

[Music]

2381.88 --> 2389.32
does bath really not get the Black Swan

2386.2 --> 2392.5
uh I'm not sure but

2389.32 --> 2394.54
he effectively if he says and he did and

2392.5 --> 2397.66
he still says it that there's things

2394.54 --> 2399.82
wrong with the Black Swan

2397.66 --> 2401.98
then yes he doesn't understand it

2399.82 --> 2404.1400000000003
because if you say that then that pretty

2401.98 --> 2406.44
much means that you don't understand it

2404.14 --> 2406.44
because

2408.46 --> 2412.2400000000002
yeah

2410.5 --> 2414.16
it's a very

2412.24 --> 2417.339
simple

2414.16 --> 2419.56
simply structured argument

2417.339 --> 2422.02
and

2419.56 --> 2425.2799999999997
like the outcome is pretty clear it's

2422.02 --> 2428.68
like either this or that

2425.28 --> 2430.5400000000004
and there is no in between you can't

2428.68 --> 2432.16
claim there's something wrong with it if

2430.54 --> 2435.0
you do that then you don't understand

2432.16 --> 2435.0

2520.72 --> 2526.18

2523.359 --> 2528.5789999999997
Peter Cullen is not

2526.18 --> 2531.54

foreign

2555.39 --> 2560.1589999999997
[Music]

2562.98 --> 2569.44
ago since I actually watched that with a

2566.56 --> 2574.119
with some attention

2569.44 --> 2576.52
I did know there was like another car

2574.119 --> 2580.5
but as far as I I don't remember him

2576.52 --> 2580.5
being like voiced by him

2584.079 --> 2589.079
but yeah maybe maybe he was I don't know

2593.38 --> 2596.6400000000003
why are you bringing this up

2610.78 --> 2613.6800000000003
what

2616.54 --> 2622.5
that reported you to YouTube for

2619.42 --> 2622.5
harassment what

2644.859 --> 2647.52
why

2675.64 --> 2678.2999999999997

2679.359 --> 2684.839

linking up to that show

2685.0 --> 2691.03
[Music]

2691.599 --> 2696.3590000000004

2694.0 --> 2696.359
it then

2706.24 --> 2711.5789999999997
but like why would he report you for

2709.54 --> 2713.2599999999998
harassment then if that video is so

2711.579 --> 2715.119
terrible why doesn't he try to report

2713.26 --> 2717.099
that

2715.119 --> 2719.98
or maybe he has and it just YouTube

2717.099 --> 2723.04
ignored him I don't know

2719.98 --> 2725.92
I think that there might be just a whole

2723.04 --> 2728.079
bunch of crazy people that report my

2725.92 --> 2731.339
videos and YouTube is just kind of like

2728.079 --> 2731.3390000000004
yeah this guy just

2733.24 --> 2738.64
he just gets under people's skin and so

2736.359 --> 2739.7799999999997
they ignore most of it maybe I don't

2738.64 --> 2741.5789999999997

3041.339 --> 3046.74
do that and just left the firework to

3314.16 --> 3318.66

when I get an Impulse too

3324.18 --> 3326.7799999999997

3328.559 --> 3334.26

like oh Ukraine is winning

umcast yeah yeah now there's a couple of

3434.52 --> 3440.059
them there's also one of the Dutch ones

3440.52 --> 3444.72
that's also

3442.319 --> 3446.4
like but she's even like I don't think

3444.72 --> 3449.359
she's even allowed back in the country

3446.4 --> 3449.359
or something now

3451.44 --> 3456.98
because she's just showing what's really

3454.44 --> 3456.98
happening

3460.859 --> 3463.5789999999997
I don't remember

3464.22 --> 3467.18
uh

3470.91 --> 3473.989
[Music]

3487.559 --> 3490.559
right

3495.18 --> 3498.96
and all this stuff is coming to float

3497.579 --> 3504.119
about that

3498.96 --> 3504.119
blowing off of the north stream pipeline

3504.96 --> 3513.7200000000003
I mean this is bad news dude

3509.04 --> 3516.7799999999997
in so many ways that that just happened

3513.72 --> 3523.04
I mean that type of action is really is

3516.78 --> 3523.0400000000004
like War declaration type material

3523.38 --> 3526.04
so

3530.76 --> 3535.1600000000003
that is so obviously the US yeah

3536.72 --> 3544.22
but I think Biden even literally

3539.339 --> 3544.22
verbally announced it a while ago

3549.83 --> 3559.67
[Music]

3567.54 --> 3575.119
right anyway that's happening out there

3572.339 --> 3575.119
foreign

3578.359 --> 3583.64
situations also rolling out here in the

3581.099 --> 3583.6400000000003
Netherlands

3583.859 --> 3588.11
they're apparently

3584.93 --> 3588.1099999999997
[Music]

3588.119 --> 3595.46
people are like cross suing each other

3592.619 --> 3595.46
so yeah

3596.52 --> 3601.819
really curious if anything at all is

3598.68 --> 3601.819
gonna happen out of that

3603.119 --> 3608.099
I really hope it it amounts to something

3605.64 --> 3612.359
it's not just there to

3608.099 --> 3614.52
like make put us all in the waiting room

3612.359 --> 3616.74
well literally

3614.52 --> 3619.88
government in power here is just

3616.74 --> 3619.8799999999997
besieging us

3620.4 --> 3627.619
with energy shortage

3623.52 --> 3627.619
and attacking our food production

3646.319 --> 3651.14
what a man like me are you nuts

3674.52 --> 3676.7

3692.359 --> 3696.799
maybe you might be right

3698.099 --> 3702.7400000000002
certainly all a giant scam set up

3703.74 --> 3707.7799999999997
I mean this is just like

3708.66 --> 3716.3999999999996
a fascist conspiracy to industri

3713.18 --> 3720.3799999999997
industrially sabotage

3716.4 --> 3725.28
like food and power supply

3720.38 --> 3729.96
resources and systems just to besiege us

3725.28 --> 3732.059
and to force changes that they want

3729.96 --> 3735.359
that's what's happening

3732.059 --> 3737.9
this is full-on fascism at this point I

3735.359 --> 3737.9
mean really

3742.799 --> 3748.92
right I mean

3745.38 --> 3751.859
the cloak of democracy is now barely

3748.92 --> 3754.559
even covering the monstrosity underneath

3751.859 --> 3758.2799999999997
it's it's not it's not working

3754.559 --> 3761.46
people see like kind of overtly

3758.28 --> 3765.7200000000003
I mean you have to even

3761.46 --> 3769.88
be just evil to not be able to see it

3765.72 --> 3769.8799999999997
it can't just pretend to not see it

3771.059 --> 3774.059
foreign

3776.72 --> 3784.14
like willing ignorance which is evil

3780.48 --> 3788.16
makes you not see it

3784.14 --> 3791.16
so yeah the veil of democracy the veneer

3788.16 --> 3793.0789999999997
is really wearing super thin it's it's

3791.16 --> 3797.1189999999997
falling apart it's there's almost

3793.079 --> 3797.119
nothing left it's just a bunch of wires

3797.76 --> 3803.98
that are not covering it at all

crypto is a nightmare

3837.42 --> 3839.54
thank you

3841.02 --> 3847.339
did you watch like some of own Benjamin

3845.28 --> 3849.6600000000003
he's had the stream about it was it

3847.339 --> 3851.46
yesterday's stream or Thursday stream

3849.66 --> 3854.7599999999998
he's been talking about it because he

3851.46 --> 3858.7200000000003
has it's interesting like he's

3854.76 --> 3860.579
like giving like economics lessons in a

3858.72 --> 3862.2599999999998
way from what he learned and he's really

3860.579 --> 3865.619
he gets it

3862.26 --> 3868.7000000000003
gets it kind of more than I do I'm not

3865.619 --> 3868.7000000000003
great with any of that

3871.859 --> 3877.74
but like this government crypto is a

3874.68 --> 3880.3799999999997
disaster it's like they could literally

3877.74 --> 3883.0789999999997
just turn it off it's

3880.38 --> 3886.88
it has a baked in Social credit score

3883.079 --> 3886.88
system if they want to

3887.16 --> 3891.48
where they can like just say like oh

3889.14 --> 3894.299
yeah he had your crypto wallet your

3891.48 --> 3896.819
crypto the money

3894.299 --> 3899.22
just doesn't work anymore for you it's

3896.819 --> 3902.819
just turn off like things will not

3899.22 --> 3907.22
accept your your card

3902.819 --> 3907.22
your ID based credit card

3908.16 --> 3913.74
like that is crypto like an ID based

3911.76 --> 3916.579
crypto credit card and then just they

3913.74 --> 3916.5789999999997
can just turn it off

3917.28 --> 3922.8590000000004
PayPal already bans people for yes

3920.46 --> 3925.68
right but at least

3922.859 --> 3928.02
you're not like it's not a national

3925.68 --> 3931.5789999999997
currency you're being forced to use

3928.02 --> 3931.579
right PGC net

3933.48 --> 3939.119
and that would be if they force

3936.02 --> 3943.079
cryptocurrency as a default

3939.119 --> 3945.2400000000002
system that means that that is now the

3943.079 --> 3948.119
forced currency

3945.24 --> 3950.9399999999996
right PayPal is a service it's like a

3948.119 --> 3954.0
bank they give you a choice

3950.94 --> 3956.18
you can literally avoid using them I

3954.0 --> 3956.18
don't

3956.76 --> 3960.2990000000004
because it's just

3958.859 --> 3963.0
yeah

3960.299 --> 3966.859
it's been too good

3963.0 --> 3966.859
like without it I don't know what I do

3967.44 --> 3971.94
I'd probably not be doing like Early

3969.9 --> 3976.319
Bird shows without it

3971.94 --> 3979.02
without that to enable me to keep

3976.319 --> 3982.319

3979.02 --> 3984.44
then buying yeah life's Necessities with

3991.68 --> 3998.24

4139.64 --> 4144.799
help too

4141.44 --> 4147.099999999999
all right a little bit is more than

4144.799 --> 4147.1
nothing

4147.5 --> 4153.56
especially when you don't have anything

4149.719 --> 4156.44
that one little bit will matter a lot so

4153.56 --> 4159.1990000000005
thank you very much for that

4156.44 --> 4161.799
another drink for your PayPal

4159.199 --> 4161.799

4162.46 --> 4168.44
I could get like three beers for that

4169.88 --> 4172.88
no

4176.779 --> 4184.819
Nathan gets crypto gifts that's cool

4180.859 --> 4186.02
I mean if crypto donators want to do

4184.819 --> 4188.839000000001
that

4186.02 --> 4192.400000000001
then could just send it to Nathan and

4188.839 --> 4192.4
tell him like Hey

4193.339 --> 4196.64
Arwin doesn't take crypto but could you

4195.8 --> 4199.76
like

4196.64 --> 4201.1990000000005
sell off some of this and give him this

4199.76 --> 4204.26
much

4201.199 --> 4205.16
I don't know man I I just I don't want

4204.26 --> 4209.08
to deal with that

4205.16 --> 4209.08
[Music]

4212.719 --> 4218.2390000000005
besides if I got that and tried to turn

4215.96 --> 4221.7390000000005
it into Cash There's a likelihood that I

4218.239 --> 4221.739
actually have to like report it

4221.9 --> 4227.36
to the government and then they might

4224.719 --> 4230.0
take everything out again

4227.36 --> 4233.239
right unless somebody's gonna like drop

4230.0 --> 4236.06
drop a thousand

4233.239 --> 4237.98
euros worth of crypto on me or something

4236.06 --> 4240.64
but yeah

4237.98 --> 4240.639999999999
I mean

4241.1 --> 4246.320000000001
in my experience thus far just even

4243.679 --> 4248.8
dealing with crypto has been a huge

4246.32 --> 4248.799999999999
hassle

4249.56 --> 4253.88
I mean if I was good at that then I

4252.26 --> 4258.08
might have just as well become a

4253.88 --> 4262.34
programmer when I was like in my teens

4258.08 --> 4265.34
because it is like almost as

4262.34 --> 4265.34

4340.1 --> 4342.6990000000005
except it

4342.98 --> 4347.839999999999
I mean it was almost look the whole

4345.32 --> 4351.5599999999995
crypto thing even

4347.84 --> 4354.679
like having crypto credit or crypto cash

4351.56 --> 4357.02
machines and all that

4354.679 --> 4359.719
it seemed like that was gonna become a

4357.02 --> 4363.1990000000005
thing it was really getting hyped up and

4359.719 --> 4366.44
then the covet program rolled out and it

4363.199 --> 4369.44
really just went straight on his ass and

4366.44 --> 4372.5199999999995
and was just discontinued

4369.44 --> 4372.5199999999995

4420.86 --> 4423.639999999999
appreciate you

4429.199 --> 4434.0599999999995
right and I hope that I I don't know I

4432.38 --> 4438.08
also hope that over at the Flat Earth

4434.06 --> 4440.3
debates I still have people's interest

4438.08 --> 4442.159
sometimes I don't know sometimes I get

4440.3 --> 4445.1
on there and then

4442.159 --> 4447.5599999999995
it was like Wednesday was like that

4445.1 --> 4450.26
where just everybody's like on the

4447.56 --> 4451.52
panels just like they're ignoring me and

4450.26 --> 4453.4400000000005
they're like

4451.52 --> 4455.120000000001
treating me I don't know maybe it's

4453.44 --> 4456.379999999999
something in my voice or something at

4455.12 --> 4458.54
such a moment

4456.38 --> 4459.86
I just feel like I'm being treated like

4458.54 --> 4461.84
as

4459.86 --> 4463.58
like a troll like I'm not actually

4461.84 --> 4466.219
supposed to be there and then people

4463.58 --> 4468.679
just ignore what I say and then I end up

4466.219 --> 4471.44
repeating myself because I'm just not

4468.679 --> 4473.62
getting any signal that anybody heard me

4471.44 --> 4473.62
foreign

4480.38 --> 4484.84
maybe it's also because I I don't know

4485.659 --> 4491.239
guys get very technical and mathematical

4488.719 --> 4494.2390000000005
over a flat Earth debate sometimes and

4491.239 --> 4497.178999999999
it's not really my thing too much I mean

4494.239 --> 4501.86
I think I made that kind of clear

4497.179 --> 4504.56
like I do get math as just like I get

4501.86 --> 4507.799999999999
programming I mean I me I understand how

4504.56 --> 4512.360000000001
it works the system of it I'm just not

4507.8 --> 4516.28
good at it at actually doing it

4512.36 --> 4516.28
but I understand things about it

4516.38 --> 4523.28
and I will be able to like

4519.44 --> 4524.719
I do pattern recognition within math

4523.28 --> 4527.36
like

4524.719 --> 4531.26
more than I actually do the math

4527.36 --> 4534.92
that's even how I got through my exam

4531.26 --> 4536.780000000001
through pattern recognition really

4534.92 --> 4539.6
and it works

4536.78 --> 4543.0199999999995
works well enough that I got through it

4539.6 --> 4545.2390000000005
I'm just not naturally good at doing the

4543.02 --> 4548.4400000000005
math

4545.239 --> 4548.44
aggravates me

4549.199 --> 4555.259999999999
I mean not that I can't do it but

4552.5 --> 4558.1
just the doing it I find it very

4555.26 --> 4558.1
annoying

4564.56 --> 4570.26
anyway

4567.08 --> 4572.719
[Music]

4570.26 --> 4575.0
I do still come up with like pretty good

4572.719 --> 4577.82
insights and I don't know

4575.0 --> 4580.699
I feel sometimes like I'm more the

4577.82 --> 4583.84
psychologist of the group or something

4580.699 --> 4586.759999999999
because that like my psychoanalysis and

4583.84 --> 4589.34
situational analysis and social behavior

4586.76 --> 4592.219
and all that that is where I do kind of

4589.34 --> 4595.9400000000005
stand out I mean

4592.219 --> 4598.78
I just do I why because I take it so

4595.94 --> 4598.78
freaking serious

4604.58 --> 4611.62
did you ever take computer programming

4607.58 --> 4611.62
classes in school when you were younger

4611.86 --> 4617.48
that no

4614.84 --> 4618.7390000000005
there wasn't any of that that I knew of

4617.48 --> 4621.678999999999
anyway

4618.739 --> 4623.599999999999
what

4621.679 --> 4626.659
I mean I think I could have probably

4623.6 --> 4629.719
done that when I was younger but

4626.659 --> 4632.239
I think in that time it was kind of like

4629.719 --> 4635.62
just like started smoking cannabis and

4632.239 --> 4635.62
it was just not interested

4636.02 --> 4642.14
I was exploring another side of me

4639.679 --> 4645.04
and like I found it tedious I've always

4642.14 --> 4645.04
found it tedious

4648.14 --> 4656.900000000001
but yeah I did try a little bit of it in

4652.76 --> 4659.4800000000005
like a sort of an education program that

4656.9 --> 4662.839999999999
did discontinue

4659.48 --> 4666.0199999999995
like they went broke or something

4662.84 --> 4667.82
but in that was also a bit of

4666.02 --> 4672.4400000000005
programming

4667.82 --> 4675.799999999999
so I did try it a bit it's just that

4672.44 --> 4678.98
it gave me such a headache

4675.8 --> 4680.54
I just couldn't focus on anything I just

4678.98 --> 4683.178999999999
at some point I was just like I don't

4680.54 --> 4685.84
care anymore I just I have to do

4683.179 --> 4685.84
something else

4710.3 --> 4715.34
have you still knocked cannabis on the

4713.239 --> 4718.239
head what

4715.34 --> 4718.2390000000005
what do you mean

4728.6 --> 4733.159000000001
remember you're saying Stop Smoke yeah

4730.64 --> 4734.900000000001
yeah but that was purely because I was

4733.159 --> 4736.159
flat broke

4734.9 --> 4738.32
yeah

4736.159 --> 4741.139999999999
because

4738.32 --> 4744.199
at some point I have to like prioritize

4741.14 --> 4746.179
like the money that I do have not for

4744.199 --> 4748.5199999999995
smoking which does make

4746.179 --> 4752.3
like even eating better

4748.52 --> 4756.38
but just like basic food

4752.3 --> 4759.38
so that's really the reason why also by

4756.38 --> 4761.78
the way to be fair it was also what I

4759.38 --> 4764.78
said is I have to smoke less

4761.78 --> 4766.94
not just because money but also because

4764.78 --> 4769.759999999999
autumn

4766.94 --> 4772.4
it matters okay during the summer

4769.76 --> 4775.159000000001
when it was hot and all that dude I

4772.4 --> 4777.259999999999
could just like smoke a lot I tried not

4775.159 --> 4779.299999999999
to because it still cost freaking money

4777.26 --> 4781.400000000001
but then as soon as like really the

4779.3 --> 4783.8
Autumn hit and started raining really

4781.4 --> 4785.599999999999
hard I just noticed that like oh just

4783.8 --> 4787.34
taking one puff from a joint now

4785.6 --> 4790.1
suddenly was like

4787.34 --> 4792.08
made me almost go paranoid so I just

4790.1 --> 4795.02
became super sensitive to it and that's

4792.08 --> 4798.94
that's mostly the reason really just say

4795.02 --> 4798.9400000000005
like oh [ __ ] Autumn there's like a

4799.219 --> 4804.44
a rotation of our inner system like

4802.64 --> 4806.14
there's a rotation of the type of

4804.44 --> 4809.178999999999
sunlight

4806.14 --> 4811.159000000001
and sadly like cannabis starts to work

4809.179 --> 4813.62
differently on the mind

4811.159 --> 4815.9
and that's really the reason why I said

4813.62 --> 4817.76
like okay just I'm just taking very

4815.9 --> 4819.32
little right it it's almost like

4817.76 --> 4822.02
economical it's like oh [ __ ] I can't

4819.32 --> 4823.4
handle it anymore hooray that means that

4822.02 --> 4826.2390000000005
you have to use very little it's going

4823.4 --> 4826.239
to be much cheaper

4828.44 --> 4832.04
right

4830.36 --> 4834.28
so that's really what I was talking

4832.04 --> 4834.28
about

4838.28 --> 4841.9
but really quitting

4847.46 --> 4856.06
well what would I replace it with

4850.699 --> 4856.0599999999995
it it does things with my body I

4860.84 --> 4868.659000000001
I think I do very badly without it

4864.92 --> 4868.659
at least for for a while

4869.48 --> 4872.718999999999
I mean the last time I really tried to

4871.699 --> 4875.599999999999
quit

4872.719 --> 4878.12
which was when I was like 20

4875.6 --> 4882.08
then 23

4878.12 --> 4884.179
I was like really miserable like really

4882.08 --> 4886.84
miserable

4884.179 --> 4890.36
not like suicidal but just like

4886.84 --> 4892.52
about absolutely everything

4890.36 --> 4895.099999999999
for weeks

4892.52 --> 4898.2390000000005
and that was when I was basically in

4895.1 --> 4898.2390000000005
Peak physical condition

4899.06 --> 4904.580000000001
right I'm still in a pretty good

4902.06 --> 4906.88
condition considering it's like 20 years

4904.58 --> 4906.88
later

4907.34 --> 4912.609
but not that good

4909.26 --> 4912.609
[Music]

4914.96 --> 4918.46
also yeah

4922.94 --> 4929.86
right if my life situation really would

4926.78 --> 4933.62
change around like I would suddenly

4929.86 --> 4936.259999999999
see it coming I get it at a more typical

4933.62 --> 4938.179
working job out there

4936.26 --> 4940.64
then I might quit

4938.179 --> 4943.46
because then I suddenly

4940.64 --> 4945.1990000000005
won't have like all this freaking time

4943.46 --> 4948.14
on my hands

4945.199 --> 4951.0199999999995
that's like becoming too much

4948.14 --> 4952.64
because smoking cannabis does actually

4951.02 --> 4957.1
kind of

4952.64 --> 4957.1
make it easier also to get through time

4964.46 --> 4971.3
anyway I'm probably boring all you guys

4967.46 --> 4974.719
here with this sorry about that

4971.3 --> 4976.9400000000005
a Cold Spring screen

4974.719 --> 4979.17
right yeah the best solution is to just

4976.94 --> 4983.438999999999
not start smoking it

4979.17 --> 4983.439
[Music]

4988.33 --> 4993.8
[Music]

4990.8 --> 4993.8
ah

4994.49 --> 4997.62
[Music]

5000.94 --> 5006.36
give yourself occupied

5003.699 --> 5006.36
right

5010.48 --> 5017.919999999999
yeah and to me specifically also what it

5014.02 --> 5020.080000000001
does is open my senses a little further

5017.92 --> 5023.02
that can be

5020.08 --> 5025.96
very handy it can also be detrimental

5023.02 --> 5028.360000000001
when you're like not doing too great and

5025.96 --> 5030.88
if I then like as a force I have it just

5028.36 --> 5032.86
smoke then my sensories might be more

5030.88 --> 5037.0
open while I'm really not in a great

5032.86 --> 5040.92
condition and so that does not tend to

5037.0 --> 5040.92
be a great influence then

5044.92 --> 5051.1
but when I'm for example like

5048.58 --> 5053.26
pretty decently inspired

5051.1 --> 5056.320000000001
or there is like an event out there

5053.26 --> 5058.54
happening and people are translating it

5056.32 --> 5061.179
then for me actually having some

5058.54 --> 5065.739
cannabis in my system makes it very easy

5061.179 --> 5071.07
for me as long as I'm Guided by a focus

5065.739 --> 5074.299999999999
to get more spiritual metadata out of it

5071.07 --> 5074.299999999999
[Music]

5076.3 --> 5081.179
a lot of programmers use it yeah I've

5078.699 --> 5081.178999999999
seen that

5081.58 --> 5086.08
like when I did that study where

5084.219 --> 5088.42
programming was also part of it there

5086.08 --> 5090.699
were like a whole bunch of people that

5088.42 --> 5093.3
were cannabis smokers that were also

5090.699 --> 5093.299999999999
programmers

5099.34 --> 5104.860000000001
I also remember that my brother on more

5102.76 --> 5107.5
than one occasion complained about

5104.86 --> 5109.839999999999
cannabis smokers because he is

5107.5 --> 5111.4
absolutely not one yet he was an actual

5109.84 --> 5114.28
programmer

5111.4 --> 5117.099999999999
but he would usually end up having to

5114.28 --> 5121.38
deal with kind of stoners

5117.1 --> 5121.38
and that was really annoying to him

5127.65 --> 5131.45

5478.84 --> 5481.9800000000005
I don't think so

5490.9 --> 5495.4
at least not like tearing it up I mean

5493.78 --> 5498.34
there might be

5495.4 --> 5502.0199999999995
questions about it from Russia like do

5498.34 --> 5502.02
we really have to keep doing that or

5503.02 --> 5509.92
I mean maybe maybe they are like saying

5507.58 --> 5514.38
okay well

5509.92 --> 5514.38
since everybody's turning against us

5515.679 --> 5522.4
why not just do that then

5518.56 --> 5526.4400000000005
just do it anyway because yeah

5522.4 --> 5526.44
they're ready against us so why not

okay what it could also mean if it's an

5704.26 --> 5709.659000000001
army podcaster it is that

5707.199 --> 5711.4
America is actually breaking the

5709.659 --> 5712.9
Antarctic treaty and they're just

5711.4 --> 5716.159
projecting it

5712.9 --> 5716.159
I mean that is

5716.5 --> 5720.42
what they do you know

5724.8 --> 5729.6990000000005
if suddenly within Army circles it's

5728.139 --> 5732.179
popping up

oh oh

5732.179 --> 5738.2390000000005
we heard that Putin is breaking the

5735.1 --> 5738.2390000000005
Antarctic treaty

5738.3 --> 5743.6990000000005
that means that we have to be there

yeah

5745.239 --> 5752.44
that's how that works

5748.3 --> 5755.08

5983.92 --> 5990.58
I was a banker probably still is

5988.179 --> 5993.179
so

5990.58 --> 5993.179
yeah

6009.67 --> 6013.1900000000005
[Music]

6011.88 --> 6016.8
okay

6013.19 --> 6016.799999999999
[Music]

6025.219 --> 6032.82
beneath the Frozen well lva Paul I mean

6030.0 --> 6035.699
not necessarily like a living

6032.82 --> 6040.38
civilization probably

6035.699 --> 6044.96
but yeah I mean stories about there

6040.38 --> 6044.96
being a world underneath the ice there

6046.86 --> 6053.42
or even like it being the entrance to

6050.34 --> 6057.6
Shale like a giant

6053.42 --> 6060.4800000000005
gigantic Cavern underneath

6057.6 --> 6062.219
that is like yeah

6060.48 --> 6064.73
super fast

6062.219 --> 6065.82
like its own little world I mean

6064.73 --> 6069.718999999999
[Music]

6065.82 --> 6072.0
that idea has existed for a while

6069.719 --> 6074.28
and then rumor that the Nazis got in

6072.0 --> 6076.139
there and

6074.28 --> 6078.86
and that that place might be new

6076.139 --> 6078.86
schwabenland

6084.06 --> 6090.4400000000005
so that's not necessarily a hollow Earth

6087.06 --> 6090.4400000000005
it's just a

6090.54 --> 6095.82
a cavern

6093.0 --> 6100.219
a giant Cavern underneath

6095.82 --> 6100.219
like really deep underneath

6100.81 --> 6104.849
[Music]

6105.48 --> 6110.5199999999995
in the rectangular local model Wars

6107.88 --> 6113.3

6110.52 --> 6113.3
South

6127.94 --> 6132.379999999999
Journey to the Center of the Earth Style

6135.84 --> 6142.679
I mean that idea was certainly inspired

6140.46 --> 6146.699
by that but I mean

6142.679 --> 6149.58
the idea of shale or like a

6146.699 --> 6151.619
a giant Cavern like which by the way has

6149.58 --> 6153.78
its own type of sun

6151.619 --> 6155.88
right that's one of those things that is

6153.78 --> 6160.98
constantly being said

6155.88 --> 6164.76
even the Dark World Visions I even

6160.98 --> 6164.759999999999
had some interaction

6165.179 --> 6170.1
that there's just this Smoky Cloud that

6168.78 --> 6172.5599999999995
is

6170.1 --> 6175.679
the sun there it's not the sun it's just

6172.56 --> 6178.1990000000005
a smoky Cloud that

6175.679 --> 6180.679
that just gives off light and lights

6178.199 --> 6180.678999999999
things up

6192.739 --> 6195.86
all right

6196.86 --> 6201.839999999999
A Journey to the Center of the Earth was

6198.96 --> 6203.88
a really fascinating story

6201.84 --> 6205.92
[Music]

6203.88 --> 6209.04
I was very much into like Jules Fern

6205.92 --> 6211.5
type stories when I was a kid and that

6209.04 --> 6214.04
was one that was like really fascinating

6211.5 --> 6214.04
to me

6214.739 --> 6219.98
because there is just

6216.659 --> 6219.98
so much to it

6233.46 --> 6239.88
what about that stuff that comes out of

6235.8 --> 6242.360000000001
volcanoes that's created locally

6239.88 --> 6242.36
just

6242.46 --> 6249.38
that's not like it's the volcanoes

6245.159 --> 6252.48
aren't like sitting on Giant

6249.38 --> 6255.4800000000005
Subterranean oceans of lava

6252.48 --> 6260.699
so like even within the official Bowl

6255.48 --> 6263.759999999999
claim that's not part of of the model

6260.699 --> 6266.28
right volcano is allegedly caused by

6263.76 --> 6268.8
tectonic friction

6266.28 --> 6271.8
so it's like locally rubbing it up until

6268.8 --> 6274.679
it heats up then turns to Lava it starts

6271.8 --> 6278.360000000001
to pressurize and then squirts out

6274.679 --> 6278.36
when the volcano erupts

6278.88 --> 6282.4400000000005
yeah so it's local

6285.3 --> 6288.3
foreign

6301.139 --> 6307.1990000000005
what underneath

6303.78 --> 6309.659
there's a total volume available for

6307.199 --> 6312.659
physical reality to be in

6309.659 --> 6315.239
there's no underneath

6312.659 --> 6317.96
at the bottom they're simply the border

6315.239 --> 6317.959999999999
of no space

6328.139 --> 6332.9400000000005
oh

6330.38 --> 6335.719
that's sweet Scott thank you very much

6332.94 --> 6335.719
I'll check it out

6351.06 --> 6354.06
hmm

6358.49 --> 6363.9
[Music]

6360.06 --> 6367.9800000000005
you got the the Muppet icon yeah thank

6363.9 --> 6371.36
you very much thank you Scott and Mrs

6367.98 --> 6371.36
really appreciate that

6371.83 --> 6375.0689999999995
[Music]

6378.36 --> 6383.88
hope you're enjoying the show too

6381.78 --> 6387.179
it's only going to last like 10 more

6383.88 --> 6389.96
minutes and then the handyman is going

6387.179 --> 6389.96
to arrive here

6393.42 --> 6397.9800000000005
yeah but it's been a great show thank

6396.179 --> 6399.42
you so much for that support I really

6397.98 --> 6401.94
needed it

6399.42 --> 6404.9400000000005
really needed it

6401.94 --> 6407.879999999999
and yeah just see that just multiple

6404.94 --> 6410.28
people having little bits throwing it on

6407.88 --> 6412.38
on a pile yeah then suddenly it does

6410.28 --> 6414.54
actually become

6412.38 --> 6418.159000000001
great sufficient

6414.54 --> 6418.159
epic thank you so much

6419.28 --> 6423.84
anybody else wants to throw their nickel

6421.619 --> 6425.25
on top of that

6423.84 --> 6428.55
feel free

6425.25 --> 6428.55
[Music]

6432.239 --> 6434.36
um

6434.74 --> 6439.5599999999995
[Music]

6441.06 --> 6446.3
right that looks for the deep

6442.98 --> 6446.299999999999
underground well

6446.639 --> 6453.36
was it Romania or Bulgaria

6450.9 --> 6455.04
underneath that region there there's

6453.36 --> 6457.619
like the

6455.04 --> 6460.5
biggest caves

6457.619 --> 6462.9
structure that is like partially even

6460.5 --> 6466.4
been explored and they they don't know

6462.9 --> 6466.4
how fast it even gets

6469.26 --> 6473.84
now that would be interesting right just

6471.96 --> 6477.039
to see how far that could go

6473.84 --> 6477.039
[Music]

6477.719 --> 6483.42
and who knows maybe that cave system

6480.08 --> 6487.86
eventually is literally gonna like open

6483.42 --> 6490.92
up to like the giant Cavern

6487.86 --> 6493.259999999999
who knows right maybe there's even like

6490.92 --> 6495.9
a staircase there

6493.26 --> 6498.06
how freaking trippy would that be

6495.9 --> 6500.04
can you imagine or you're like cave

6498.06 --> 6502.820000000001
explorers and like

6500.04 --> 6502.82
totally

6502.86 --> 6509.82
like 50 kilometers below the surface

6506.4 --> 6512.759999999999
like crazy I mean that that the cave

6509.82 --> 6515.46
complex there might literally go further

6512.76 --> 6518.76
than the cola diboro

6515.46 --> 6521.52
okay it literally may go deeper

6518.76 --> 6524.820000000001
so what if they just move around

6521.52 --> 6528.0
and then suddenly they're like they find

6524.82 --> 6529.98
the opening

6528.0 --> 6531.739
and then when they look there's like

6529.98 --> 6535.199
this

6531.739 --> 6537.239
archaically ancient staircase that's all

6535.199 --> 6541.259999999999
like covered in

6537.239 --> 6543.9
like dripping Stone residue and all that

6541.26 --> 6546.5
like completely covered in

6543.9 --> 6546.5
whatever

6546.659 --> 6554.339999999999
and there's just this insanely large

6549.719 --> 6555.3
staircase that like takes

6554.34 --> 6559.08
okay

6555.3 --> 6562.04
hours and hours to walk down while it

6559.08 --> 6565.5
meanwhile you're surrounded by just pure

6562.04 --> 6568.32
black you literally cannot see anything

6565.5 --> 6571.58
around you wouldn't that be

6568.32 --> 6571.58
absolutely amazing

6573.9 --> 6579.239
and where do I get this idea well it's

6576.6 --> 6581.34
based on it

6579.239 --> 6583.619
it's based on what could be possible but

6581.34 --> 6585.3
visually like I used to play a game

6583.619 --> 6587.639
still have it on my computer but I don't

6585.3 --> 6589.56
really play it much anymore forever

6587.639 --> 6591.36
because it just kind of finished playing

6589.56 --> 6595.1990000000005
it Dwarf Fortress

6591.36 --> 6598.44
and in there you even go through Lava

6595.199 --> 6601.259999999999
and to dig adamantine which is like in

6598.44 --> 6602.339999999999
the lava and then you can end up in

6601.26 --> 6603.84
Holes

6602.34 --> 6606.0
to hell

6603.84 --> 6607.8
it's filled with demons and [ __ ] but you

6606.0 --> 6610.679
can sort of avoid them and I literally

6607.8 --> 6613.679
try to build a staircase

6610.679 --> 6616.26
like from the top just build yeah this

6613.679 --> 6620.4
weird mechanics is sort of

6616.26 --> 6623.88
uh sort of Minecraft but

6620.4 --> 6626.219
less about just building it's it's much

6623.88 --> 6628.7390000000005
more complicated

6626.219 --> 6632.4
and like can craft anything

6628.739 --> 6634.678999999999
but like it's actually real serious

6632.4 --> 6638.04
mechanics not just

6634.679 --> 6639.96
super conveniently oversimplified and

6638.04 --> 6641.88
you cannot literally you don't have a

6639.96 --> 6644.28
first person interface you only can just

6641.88 --> 6646.32
set things like you can make plans and

6644.28 --> 6648.96
then go dwarves of Dwarf Fortress make

6646.32 --> 6651.54
it and I did make like this

6648.96 --> 6654.42
yeah the opening to hell and then just

6651.54 --> 6657.5
build a staircase quickly

6654.42 --> 6660.84
and then close it off so that demons

6657.5 --> 6662.94
cannot literally yeah get in there and

6660.84 --> 6666.1990000000005
invade your entire Fortress which they

6662.94 --> 6666.199
will do very quickly

6666.38 --> 6670.02
so I don't think in this shell there

6669.0 --> 6671.639
will be

6670.02 --> 6675.26
that kind of

6671.639 --> 6675.26
demons I hope

6677.4 --> 6681.599999999999
I mean there might be some really creepy

6679.8 --> 6684.119000000001
presences there

6681.6 --> 6686.639
Spirit wise it might be when you get

6684.119 --> 6690.119
there you might feel like there's

6686.639 --> 6693.2390000000005
something really wrong here and maybe

6690.119 --> 6695.28
even the Dwarf Fortress designer had

6693.239 --> 6699.419999999999
that idea

6695.28 --> 6702.42
based on some experience like that

6699.42 --> 6702.42
foreign

6703.82 --> 6709.0199999999995
all that but

6706.739 --> 6712.08
it's pretty freaky if you just end up

6709.02 --> 6714.4800000000005
somewhere and you enter like from the

6712.08 --> 6717.42
top not from the side or anything from

6714.48 --> 6719.159
the top like a gigantic cave and it's

6717.42 --> 6722.119
all black

6719.159 --> 6722.119
that's scary

6723.42 --> 6728.76
I mean no matter what is hanging around

6726.06 --> 6731.52
there like energy wise Spirit wise

6728.76 --> 6733.679
Spirit Echoes it's going to be scary no

6731.52 --> 6736.679
matter what

6733.679 --> 6736.679
hmm

6764.76 --> 6767.719
weird

6779.159 --> 6785.5199999999995
the patterns of seismic activity

6781.5 --> 6788.76
observed unique for many sphere yes

6785.52 --> 6793.080000000001
Professor Phil of course

6788.76 --> 6795.06
except no they just show you a model and

6793.08 --> 6797.58
then use a sphere and then looks oh look

6795.06 --> 6800.3
yeah see this is this is the real thing

6797.58 --> 6804.119
because this is what we're reading

6800.3 --> 6806.96
all total horseshit

6804.119 --> 6806.96
all of it

6811.199 --> 6815.58
it's

6812.28 --> 6817.98
very loose Whimsical predictions when

6815.58 --> 6819.54
they say that [ __ ] it only works on the

6817.98 --> 6821.159
sphere no they don't know they don't

6819.54 --> 6823.8
even know what is down there how can

6821.159 --> 6826.739
they know it only works on the sphere by

6823.8 --> 6829.38
the feedback that they get when they try

6826.739 --> 6831.419999999999
to use p waves and S waves

6829.38 --> 6833.6990000000005
on the material that they were digging

6831.42 --> 6837.78
through with the Deep Cola borehole and

6833.699 --> 6840.659
they got everything wrong every time

6837.78 --> 6844.0199999999995
yeah if they got everything wrong every

6840.659 --> 6846.42
time at like 11 miles

6844.02 --> 6850.38
you really think that they can predict

6846.42 --> 6851.6990000000005
like what is it the 500 miles deep or

6850.38 --> 6855.2390000000005
something

6851.699 --> 6857.94
and then how it all works no no they

6855.239 --> 6861.0
can't they can't even get any accurate

6857.94 --> 6862.08
prediction a few miles deep

6861.0 --> 6864.42
yeah

6862.08 --> 6867.84
certainly cannot say

6864.42 --> 6872.42
that it only works on the glove total or

6867.84 --> 6872.42
[ __ ] Professor philbel total horseshit

6881.88 --> 6885.139
no they don't

6889.04 --> 6893.18
[Music]

6894.239 --> 6899.159
right but I'm gonna round out the show

6896.4 --> 6902.659
[Music]

6899.159 --> 6902.659
how time has flown

6902.76 --> 6906.6
it was fun though

6904.92 --> 6909.78
it's a

6906.6 --> 6911.820000000001
