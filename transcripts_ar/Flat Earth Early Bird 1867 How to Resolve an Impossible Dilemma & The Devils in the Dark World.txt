to be phased out we're all going to be

1438.96 --> 1445.8400000000001
bullied to death so that it's gone the

lid's going to go back on Flat Earth

1445.84 --> 1452.48
going to be degenerate and [ __ ]

1448.4 --> 1455.4
again as it always has been artificially

1452.48 --> 1459.24
created like that because the world

1455.4 --> 1459.24
Empire is going to have to move

1459.559 --> 1464.84
on and Flat Earth is going to go back

1462.919 --> 1469.0800000000002
into the Genie

1464.84 --> 1472.36
bottle and this is part of it yeah

1469.08 --> 1475.6789999999999
effort is being spent to bully the hell

1472.36 --> 1478.039
out of us and to manipulate any flat

1475.679 --> 1480.1200000000001

lose their

minds or they just become

1492.32 --> 1497.84
robots and then nobody else is going to

1495.24 --> 1500.6
ever watch that because it's completely

1497.84 --> 1505.24
unbearable for an outsider to watch any

1500.6 --> 1507.9599999999998
of that and that way they win and now in

miserable I don't even know why I'm

2457.96 --> 2463.359
still doing this show I I actually

2460.88 --> 2464.48
thought of just completely deleting my

2463.359 --> 2467.2
Channel

2464.48 --> 2469.64
today like maybe it's just if I just

2467.2 --> 2472.04
[ __ ] delete all of it I just abandon

2469.64 --> 2475.359
the internet completely

2472.04 --> 2478.4
forever maybe that could fix it but

2475.359 --> 2481.119
probably not I'll probably still find a

way people will still have heard of some

2481.119 --> 2487.1600000000003
[ __ ] shitty gay ass troll video about

2484.44 --> 2489.359
me in 10 years I'm

2487.16 --> 2490.52
sure so that's probably not even going

2489.359 --> 2493.24
to help and that's why I'm not going to

2490.52 --> 2495.119
delete my channel I'm just like I don't

2493.24 --> 2497.7999999999997
even know why I do this

2495.119 --> 2501.4
anymore I'm just getting zered by

2497.8 --> 2506.3590000000004
[ __ ] trolls all day long everywhere I

2501.4 --> 2506.359
go and I'm so goddamn sick of

2515.24 --> 2518.24
it

2527.319 --> 2535.8
put a lot of work into it oh really oh

2531.52 --> 2535.8
yeah so much work into

2541.8 --> 2549.96
it really like what yeah what

2546.88 --> 2554.319
what did I put on the table that you can

2549.96 --> 2557.079
even remember yeah talk about this great

2554.319 --> 2559.839
input that I've given you let's see if

2557.079 --> 2561.559
you can even just remember it yeah

2559.839 --> 2563.92
everybody thinks like oh you did all

2561.559 --> 2566.8390000000004
this you did all that oh really can you

2563.92 --> 2569.2000000000003
repeat it can you actually repeat the

2566.839 --> 2573.72
things that I've

2569.2 --> 2576.64
said cuz that seems to be really

2573.72 --> 2578.68
rare yeah oh you've done so much work oh

2576.64 --> 2581.1189999999997
really so can you repeat it can you

2578.68 --> 2582.48
actually say what that was what are my

2581.119 --> 2586.1600000000003
great

2582.48 --> 2586.16
ideas yeah what are

2587.16 --> 2592.72
they oh yeah you don't

2589.76 --> 2595.92
know because nobody [ __ ] knows

2592.72 --> 2598.1189999999997
because everybody just glances past it

2595.92 --> 2600.44
and then forget about it and then have a

2598.119 --> 2602.2000000000003
vague memory of like oh he had a really

2600.44 --> 2604.079
great idea I don't know what the [ __ ] it

2602.2 --> 2608.0789999999997
was because I have a memory of a

2604.079 --> 2608.079
goldfish like everybody else out

2608.559 --> 2617.559
there energy from water that's not my

2612.559 --> 2617.559
idea that isn't my

2626.079 --> 2631.44
idea just because I brought it up

2628.4 --> 2634.52
doesn't mean that I figure that out I

2631.44 --> 2637.48
literally got that from other people in

2634.52 --> 2641.2
2010 no less

2637.48 --> 2641.2
yeah that's not my

2643.98 --> 2647.17
[Music]

2649.44 --> 2656.119
idea I don't talk to people like this in

2653.8 --> 2658.44
face Toof face situation oh well

2656.119 --> 2660.6800000000003
sometimes I do and I get really pissed

2658.44 --> 2664.28
off and then they're like whoa you were

2660.68 --> 2668.0
really pissed off yeah yeah so I have

2664.28 --> 2668.0
actually done that

2668.72 --> 2673.0
and they notice they're like yeah you

2670.68 --> 2676.04
have some serious anger issues and I'm

2673.0 --> 2680.28
yeah I do I know it's a good thing I

2676.04 --> 2686.2
don't actually just randomly assault

2680.28 --> 2686.2000000000003
people nah oh well [ __ ] off then

2687.8 --> 2691.3590000000004
[ __ ] yeah I

2694.96 --> 2697.96
have

2701.119 --> 2707.7200000000003
calling [ __ ] on 2020 was extremely

2703.839 --> 2707.72
helpful really was it

2710.559 --> 2714.2400000000002

2724.88 --> 2727.88
man

[Music]

2744.4 --> 2750.2400000000002

2746.44 --> 2753.119
here I mean sure not going to completely

2750.24 --> 2753.1189999999997
downplay it

2754.88 --> 2757.88
but

2779.319 --> 2784.119
all right anyway I'm glad you guys are

2781.319 --> 2787.44
still here non local holographic Sun

2784.119 --> 2791.2000000000003
yeah you are correct Evolution that is

2787.44 --> 2792.599
my idea I'm the first [ __ ] person in

2791.2 --> 2796.5589999999997
this

2792.599 --> 2800.44
world to actually describe it like that

2796.559 --> 2802.8
in this [ __ ] world in the entire

2800.44 --> 2804.599
history of humanity I'm the first

2802.8 --> 2806.119
[ __ ] person that it described it that

2804.599 --> 2810.04
way that is

2806.119 --> 2811.96
correct yeah other people haven't even

2810.04 --> 2816.68
attempted to do

2811.96 --> 2820.0
that a plma moon oh wow so

2816.68 --> 2824.0789999999997
revolutionary plasma Moon plasma no

2820.0 --> 2824.079
[ __ ] retards all of them

2829.72 --> 2834.7999999999997
retards yeah cuz it's [ __ ]

2836.0 --> 2843.319
true the angular

2840.24 --> 2848.04
manifestation of celestial

2843.319 --> 2851.44
light with a apparent Celestial body at

2848.04 --> 2854.7599999999998
the epicenter of the angular

2851.44 --> 2854.76
manifestation that's

2856.76 --> 2862.3190000000004
right is it projected I don't [ __ ]

2860.0 --> 2866.839
know I'm just describing the

2862.319 --> 2869.359
form I don't I have no idea how it is

2866.839 --> 2874.72
actually manifesting yeah just like I

2869.359 --> 2876.359
have no damn idea how life actually

2874.72 --> 2879.04
works

2876.359 --> 2881.2
how what happens in a Cell other than

2879.04 --> 2884.4
the breath of life is what they call

2881.2 --> 2887.04
it which is I was very inspired by that

2884.4 --> 2890.92
video by the way Richard G I I continued

2887.04 --> 2894.72
watching it the whole thing I was really

2890.92 --> 2896.96
imp it reminded me it reminded me of

2894.72 --> 2898.9199999999996
something that I already knew had just

2896.96 --> 2900.319
kind of Forgotten because it's all so

2898.92 --> 2903.92
damn

2900.319 --> 2909.079
surreal so all this genetic hor [ __ ] was

2903.92 --> 2911.64
made up like genetic is just made

2909.079 --> 2916.599
up like there's nothing

2911.64 --> 2916.5989999999997
happening inside of a cell like

2918.44 --> 2926.68
that and how they're able to even

2921.28 --> 2926.6800000000003
manipulate anything is a

2930.28 --> 2936.559
miracle is the night sky projected what

2934.48 --> 2939.16
you mean the Stars yeah all of the

2936.559 --> 2939.1600000000003
celestial

2940.44 --> 2947.559
lights including the moon and the sun

2944.559 --> 2949.76
all of it all the lights that are above

2947.559 --> 2949.76
the

2950.16 --> 2955.8799999999997
Horizon that naturally appear not

2952.72 --> 2955.8799999999997
because of an airplane or

2964.28 --> 2970.7200000000003
whatever J ex yes I know it really

2973.28 --> 2980.96
is I don't believe Earth is covered in a

2976.599 --> 2984.48
dome well that's not my unique input

2980.96 --> 2988.44
there's plenty of people that think like

2984.48 --> 2991.2400000000002
no Dome is very specific like geometric

2988.44 --> 2991.2400000000002
and I don't think

2994.359 --> 2998.48
so I I think it has a flat

3007.04 --> 3012.68
top medicine oh really you think

3010.44 --> 3018.28
genetics are real well think

3012.68 --> 3018.2799999999997
again cuz nobody's ever actually seen

3018.359 --> 3024.359
genetics it's all animated horse [ __ ]

3022.0 --> 3024.359
all of

3024.44 --> 3027.44
it

3031.2 --> 3035.24
you don't get to see any of it they

3033.119 --> 3037.2000000000003
don't even get to see the internal

3035.24 --> 3041.2
workings of a

3037.2 --> 3043.72
cell you can see how a cell Willman like

3041.2 --> 3043.72
copy

3043.88 --> 3049.2400000000002
itself but you can't see how that is

3049.4 --> 3055.2400000000002
happening you can't go deeper into it

3052.44 --> 3057.64
like they can't you just can't see it

3055.24 --> 3061.0
there there's no way to derive it all

3057.64 --> 3065.64
they've ever done is just create a bunch

3061.0 --> 3068.599
of desperate models to try to explain it

3065.64 --> 3072.799
through like atomism and all that it's

3068.599 --> 3072.799
all nonsense it doesn't

3077.26 --> 3080.469
[Music]

3084.359 --> 3087.359
work

3088.359 --> 3092.7599999999998
what do I think the smallest thing there

3090.119 --> 3092.76
is

3094.799 --> 3100.4
no I don't think I don't think about

3097.96 --> 3101.88
that [ __ ] got better time things to

3100.4 --> 3106.559
waste my time

3101.88 --> 3108.6800000000003
on but to die far and Far and far away

3106.559 --> 3111.8390000000004
from the perspective of just being a

3108.68 --> 3114.8799999999997
human being here I'm not going to go

3111.839 --> 3119.44
into all that nonsense in my desperation

3114.88 --> 3121.88
to try to to escape the reality of being

3119.44 --> 3121.88
what I

3124.76 --> 3130.76
am there's nothing you can get out of it

3128.16 --> 3133.44
there's nothing good you can make with

3130.76 --> 3135.48
it you don't trust microscopes why the

3133.44 --> 3137.88
hell wouldn't you trust a microscope I

3135.48 --> 3139.839
mean you're just looking at it like

3137.88 --> 3142.599
that's like the one thing you can

3139.839 --> 3147.2799999999997
actually trust because it's

3142.599 --> 3147.28
just a microscope

3168.599 --> 3174.2400000000002
what you know two geneticist fryologist

3171.559 --> 3176.48
and you're they're basically deranged

3174.24 --> 3179.4399999999996
yeah that's what happens when you

3176.48 --> 3179.44
surrender to

3180.92 --> 3188.119
Satan it's their little lie that they

3184.72 --> 3190.5589999999997
get to manage and do damage with on the

3188.119 --> 3194.6800000000003
world and make money with it's their

3190.559 --> 3198.92
little lie and they know it's a

3194.68 --> 3202.0
lie you find out it's a

3198.92 --> 3205.92
lie there's no way you can't find out

3202.0 --> 3210.359
all those people all find out it's a lie

3205.92 --> 3210.359
all of them they know it's a

3210.4 --> 3218.2400000000002
lie you can't become a professional in

3214.599 --> 3221.1600000000003
in those fields and not know that it's

3218.24 --> 3221.16
all a

3227.839 --> 3233.52
lie strong man routine I don't know it's

3231.68 --> 3236.96
like if he doesn't trust microscopes

3233.52 --> 3239.24
well that's cute it's your problem it's

3236.96 --> 3242.599
like the one thing I do actually trust

3239.24 --> 3245.8799999999997
like yeah that's an actual just a

3242.599 --> 3245.88
lens that's

3252.799 --> 3255.799
it

3258.24 --> 3261.9199999999996
no I don't know it's just

3264.079 --> 3267.079
somebody

3271.04 --> 3274.0
I don't know what that

3275.28 --> 3280.4
is some kind of tool working on wood or

3278.96 --> 3284.319
something I don't know what the hell

3280.4 --> 3284.319
that is but it does make noise

3285.0 --> 3290.92
yeah threshold is set bad no it works

3288.28 --> 3294.3590000000004
absolutely fine there's nothing wrong

3290.92 --> 3297.6800000000003
with my setting my setup with my sound

3294.359 --> 3297.68
it just makes makes a lot of

3300.88 --> 3307.88
noise oh let's not what shut

3304.119 --> 3307.88
up stop being so

3307.92 --> 3312.6800000000003
metalsome yeah I already been yelling

3310.319 --> 3316.48
all over the place like who the [ __ ]

3312.68 --> 3316.48
cares about a bunch of noise in the

3324.0 --> 3327.0
background

3336.52 --> 3341.96
right but yeah sounds something to make

3339.96 --> 3344.2
people look stupid well yeah it

3341.96 --> 3346.359
definitely succeeded because he looked

3344.2 --> 3347.839
very [ __ ] stupid for saying something

3346.359 --> 3349.2
like that and that's why I immediately

3347.839 --> 3353.44
addressed

3349.2 --> 3356.0789999999997
it so he's not going to strawman anybody

3353.44 --> 3358.2400000000002
with it like his St stupidity has been

3356.079 --> 3360.48
identified immediately so don't worry

3358.24 --> 3360.4799999999996
about

3365.76 --> 3371.599
it where hell are all these people man I

3368.599 --> 3374.1600000000003
never even heard of any of you who are

3371.599 --> 3375.6800000000003
you how the hell did you just suddenly

3374.16 --> 3378.52
come in my

3375.68 --> 3380.96
chat like with five different people

3378.52 --> 3382.88
that I've never seen before where the

3380.96 --> 3385.119
hell did you even come

3382.88 --> 3387.559
from whatever anyway I'm going to turn

3385.119 --> 3387.559
on my

3413.88 --> 3416.88
coffee

3430.64 --> 3433.24
son shut

3443.799 --> 3446.799
up

3451.51 --> 3454.6490000000003
[Music]

3459.48 --> 3465.2
cameras cannot be trusted because

3461.839 --> 3470.0789999999997
processor can manipulate the

3465.2 --> 3472.72
image uh yeah I mean that's literally

3470.079 --> 3476.44
like clearing things up and all

3472.72 --> 3479.1189999999997
that me

3476.44 --> 3482.44
I mean you wouldn't maybe be able to

3479.119 --> 3485.039
trust it like as in evidence in

3482.44 --> 3487.16
court like if you have a long distance

3485.039 --> 3489.28
photograph then maybe that wouldn't hold

3487.16 --> 3492.839
up in court because of the digital

3489.28 --> 3492.8390000000004
processing or whatever but I

3498.079 --> 3504.2400000000002
mean yeah it's just I don't get it like

3501.88 --> 3508.52
yeah that's digital photography like

3504.24 --> 3508.52
yeah there's processing happening that's

3523.039 --> 3528.3190000000004
right if you look through a telescope at

3525.72 --> 3531.68
a planet and took a

3528.319 --> 3535.48
photo yeah well that's different

3531.68 --> 3538.72
though cuz some of those telescopes

3535.48 --> 3541.359
they have weird like insistent

3538.72 --> 3545.799
functioning which lit

3541.359 --> 3549.72
like if the processing goes beyond just

3545.799 --> 3552.4
like processing the entire image to like

3549.72 --> 3554.839
sharpen things up or whatever right

3552.4 --> 3557.6800000000003
that's one thing but if it's literally

3554.839 --> 3560.96
like oh we're going to also insert these

3557.68 --> 3562.8799999999997
things into the image digitally yeah

3560.96 --> 3564.7200000000003
then it becomes really suspicious

3562.88 --> 3567.559
because if they can insert something

3564.72 --> 3570.24
ually in there on top of the image yeah

3567.559 --> 3573.799
that it can also like oh yeah we have

3570.24 --> 3575.7599999999998
another image of this planet that we

3573.799 --> 3579.44
prefer to show you instead of what

3575.76 --> 3582.8390000000004
you're actually looking at yeah that's

3579.44 --> 3585.359
the thing I called that Years Ago by the

3582.839 --> 3588.24
way it's like I don't trust like those

3585.359 --> 3591.44
really expensive super digital

3588.24 --> 3594.24
telescopes that are even that regular

3591.44 --> 3597.68
people can buy because then you can zoom

3594.24 --> 3600.5589999999997
in on Planet supposedly and see way more

3597.68 --> 3603.52
detail than anybody could ever possibly

3600.559 --> 3603.52
see with a

3605.2 --> 3612.359
telescope like I don't trust those

3609.0 --> 3615.359
telescopes but I mean I trust my

3612.359 --> 3617.96
p900 to be pretty

3615.359 --> 3620.68
accurate right there's some digital

3617.96 --> 3620.68
stuff in there

3622.559 --> 3628.079
too oh yeah oh important piece of input

3648.92 --> 3654.119
bye bro I have a really weird experience

3652.4 --> 3656.0
I can't tell whether that actually

3654.119 --> 3657.92
happened or if it was in the dark world

3656.0 --> 3661.76
if it was it was in the Dark World when

3657.92 --> 3666.799
it was a really really

3661.76 --> 3668.96
young like 10 or something I remember

3666.799 --> 3672.24
looking through a supposed

3668.96 --> 3675.16
telescope and then somebody actually had

3672.24 --> 3677.68
and I could tell I could tell what it

3675.16 --> 3682.2
was they had like

3677.68 --> 3685.0789999999997
a a fake setup and a piece of

3682.2 --> 3687.2799999999997
paper that was representing planet and

3685.079 --> 3689.319
it was almost decent looking it's just

3687.28 --> 3691.96
that I have really good eyes I can

3689.319 --> 3694.0389999999998
really tell was just a mock telescope

3691.96 --> 3698.92
set

3694.039 --> 3701.44
up no it wasn't when I was what was

3698.92 --> 3703.119
older but I don't know where that

3701.44 --> 3706.48
happened it might have been in the

3703.119 --> 3709.0
middle of my Dark World

3706.48 --> 3711.16
experience I just yeah so it's not

3709.0 --> 3714.599
tangible it's not actually physically

3711.16 --> 3717.0389999999998
happened I just still remember that and

3714.599 --> 3719.2000000000003
it was just really weird I think that

3717.039 --> 3723.279
the demons in the Dark World actually

3719.2 --> 3726.9199999999996
test you on your sensibility to see how

3723.279 --> 3730.2
dim you are and then as a as a

3726.92 --> 3733.7200000000003
consequence how much they can [ __ ] with

3730.2 --> 3735.7599999999998
you but despite that at the time I was

3733.72 --> 3738.52
definitely a globe believer like a

3735.76 --> 3740.5200000000004
Ballwin style Globe believer so way more

3738.52 --> 3742.88
Dynamic than the actual Globe Believers

3740.52 --> 3745.2
out there that really do believe it I

3742.88 --> 3746.799
would still see fakery

3745.2 --> 3748.1189999999997
and as soon as it's like yeah do you

3746.799 --> 3749.52
really think this is real it's like no

3748.119 --> 3751.559
they definitely faked that doesn't mean

3749.52 --> 3754.0
it can't be

3751.559 --> 3755.599
real that would be my response and they

3754.0 --> 3757.72
were testing me and this was one of

3755.599 --> 3760.079
those tests I think they like look

3757.72 --> 3762.359
through this telescope really big thing

3760.079 --> 3765.1600000000003
like really big look into it and you

3762.359 --> 3769.24
literally see like wow that's a

3765.16 --> 3773.359
planet uh or a piece of

3769.24 --> 3775.52
paper on which a planet is

3773.359 --> 3777.96
drawn

3775.52 --> 3780.96
yeah dark world it's a hallucinatory

3777.96 --> 3780.96
non-physical

3781.52 --> 3787.64
experience

3783.119 --> 3791.039
a lucid a Perpetual lucid dream if you

3787.64 --> 3794.72
will you want to compare it to something

3791.039 --> 3798.119
it's a lucid dream that just doesn't

3794.72 --> 3800.319
end and it's more real than reality it's

3798.119 --> 3803.4
like your senses work better you see

3800.319 --> 3806.88
more you hear more more detail in

3803.4 --> 3810.319
everything it feels more real than

3806.88 --> 3812.039
reality it's really freaky in that sense

3810.319 --> 3813.44
especially when demons start [ __ ]

3812.039 --> 3816.8300000000004
with

3813.44 --> 3819.92
you and it's their realm all

3816.83 --> 3819.92
[Music]

3826.799 --> 3833.279
right can you go there willingly no and

3829.839 --> 3836.279
if you do you're out of your [ __ ]

3833.279 --> 3836.279
mind

3837.799 --> 3843.0
well you could go there don't do it

3840.2 --> 3845.48
never do it if you're going to ask me

3843.0 --> 3849.0
about oh how can I get that experience

3845.48 --> 3851.52
I'm going to ban you yeah it's been the

3849.0 --> 3854.24
biggest [ __ ] nightmare I could ever

3851.52 --> 3856.799
have conceived for myself going through

3854.24 --> 3859.799
that thing was the biggest nightmare

3856.799 --> 3859.799
ever

3860.599 --> 3867.279
literally I only talk about it because

3863.92 --> 3871.359
then can still get something out of it

3867.279 --> 3871.359
it's not just all for nothing

3873.76 --> 3879.48
then I didn't suffer through it for

3876.72 --> 3882.279
absolutely

3879.48 --> 3885.839
nothing that's why I still talk about it

3882.279 --> 3889.559
yeah you don't want that nobody should

3885.839 --> 3892.96
want that when you go into it you get

3889.559 --> 3896.1600000000003
this very dreaded feeling like you're

3892.96 --> 3896.16
going to hell

3896.359 --> 3900.44
yeah I don't recommend

3915.64 --> 3922.48
it yeah well you should be wary of it

3918.88 --> 3922.48
stay the hell away from

3923.079 --> 3926.079
it

3933.0 --> 3939.279
do I keep going to the Dark World no

3935.96 --> 3941.76
it's just a parallel experience now my

3939.279 --> 3944.68
conscious doesn't displace into it

3941.76 --> 3945.92
anymore thank God because that's just

3944.68 --> 3948.279
pure

3945.92 --> 3952.2400000000002
nightmarish overall it's been the most

3948.279 --> 3952.24
UN unpleasant experience

3952.4 --> 3958.039
ever when I had that big go I thought

3955.44 --> 3959.52
that at the end of the trip I was going

3958.039 --> 3962.5200000000004
to

3959.52 --> 3962.52
die

3963.559 --> 3968.7200000000003
yeah I was basically postponing the

3966.52 --> 3971.24
suffering within the experience just

3968.72 --> 3975.1189999999997
because I thought that I might survive

3971.24 --> 3978.64
longer that's how it was I felt if I'm

3975.119 --> 3983.0
going to give up in here then I will die

3978.64 --> 3984.52
like I will get physically killed yeah

3983.0 --> 3989.319
not [ __ ]

3984.52 --> 3992.079
Pleasant a goddamned nightmare the whole

3989.319 --> 3995.72
[ __ ] thing was a godamn

3992.079 --> 3995.7200000000003

4040.079 --> 4047.88
honesty [ __ ] I have so many

4045.119 --> 4051.319
regrets there's so many things I just

4047.88 --> 4052.839
should have never ever talked

4051.319 --> 4055.599
about

4052.839 --> 4061.0
ever it's just that I didn't know what

4055.599 --> 4061.0
to [ __ ] do with myself man I didn't

4068.2 --> 4072.24
like I wish I could have just been

4070.72 --> 4076.7599999999998
honest

4072.24 --> 4079.0389999999998
without sharing all those

4076.76 --> 4082.4
things nobody's going to be able to

handle it anyway

4083.72 --> 4092.24
nobody are we still live we still

4088.88 --> 4092.2400000000002

4144.52 --> 4150.040000000001
[ __ ] day long and nobody does

they don't have self Destiny it's just

demons

4254.32 --> 4261.239
can't do anything about

it yeah because the [ __ ] they it'll

4261.239 --> 4266.04
get to the point where the government

4263.28 --> 4270.599999999999
will literally protect the

coffee was actually a good idea since

4358.12 --> 4360.5599999999995
I'm kind of

[Music]

4372.44 --> 4375.44
hungry

4384.92 --> 4389.88
and this freaking [ __ ] up Society too

4387.719 --> 4393.56
man like what the

4389.88 --> 4398.28
sjw [ __ ] did with

4393.56 --> 4401.679
bullying has made it like 10 times worse

4398.28 --> 4405.36
than it was before they arrived to do

4401.679 --> 4405.36
that yeah

4405.52 --> 4414.280000000001
people are bigger bullies now because of

4409.84 --> 4417.360000000001
them bigger bullies yeah because nobody

4414.28 --> 4421.0
now stops the bullies because if you do

4417.36 --> 4424.599999999999
that then you must be some kind of

4421.0 --> 4429.56
sjw yeah that's where we're at

4424.6 --> 4433.52
now yeah that's how the devil won they

4429.56 --> 4435.8
won through that because people did EX

4433.52 --> 4439.679
exactly as

4435.8 --> 4442.92
predicted yeah they rejected the notion

4439.679 --> 4445.36
that you couldn't bully and now you

4442.92 --> 4448.28
can't even stop the bullying anymore

4445.36 --> 4448.28
without being an

4448.48 --> 4455.12
shw yeah you're going to just be shamed

4451.159 --> 4458.12
they made it worse they made it worse a

that they can just do these things like

4482.0 --> 4487.679
start some [ __ ] maist Cultural

4484.639 --> 4491.36
Revolution and do that I can't believe

4487.679 --> 4491.36
that that's just

4492.08 --> 4499.6
possible like where's the fail safe

4494.76 --> 4499.6

happening yeah where is the fail safe

mechanisms to Snuff a cultural

revolution like

4509.0 --> 4515.04
that because that's exactly what you

4511.32 --> 4515.04
need to do you need to Snuff

4515.08 --> 4523.76
it kill it off before it touches

4520.44 --> 4526.919999999999
anybody arrest the people involved

4523.76 --> 4530.92
like on [ __ ] made up charges for all

4526.92 --> 4530.92

handle the truth they can't handle any

5037.159 --> 5039.36
of

5042.08 --> 5047.8
it so they're just writing information

5045.28 --> 5051.719
that burns them and the burning is what

5047.8 --> 5054.12
they throw out all the time just reject

5051.719 --> 5056.4
everything reject reject reality reject

5054.12 --> 5059.28
reality reject this reality I'm going to

5056.4 --> 5062.48
make my parallel constructed ridicule

version of it and then spout that as

5062.48 --> 5068.28
they cannot handle reality I'm sick of

5065.28 --> 5070.84
it there people like I

5068.28 --> 5072.96
mean I could wish them all kinds of

5070.84 --> 5077.1990000000005
things that are really

5072.96 --> 5079.76
nasty but I am I would I technically

5077.199 --> 5082.36
wouldn't need to do that because I know

5079.76 --> 5084.4400000000005
for a fact that people that act like

5082.36 --> 5087.599999999999
that and keep doing

5084.44 --> 5090.04
it they get

cancer and that cancer is not going to

5090.04 --> 5095.32
go away you see

you can't eat a bunch

5095.32 --> 5100.44
of what is

5097.32 --> 5103.84
it apricot seeds or whatever and then

5100.44 --> 5106.44
make it go away no no because that's a

5103.84 --> 5108.6
cancer that directly created by the

5106.44 --> 5113.119
spirit and your

5108.6 --> 5117.56
rejection it does that seen it do that

5113.119 --> 5122.0
to people yeah my mother being one of

5117.56 --> 5124.76
them yeah she got it because there were

5122.0 --> 5128.52
things about reality that she could not

5124.76 --> 5130.84
handle all her life and she never was

5128.52 --> 5130.84
able

5131.56 --> 5138.360000000001
to like if you tried to make her face it

5135.4 --> 5140.96
like she would like on an instinctive

5138.36 --> 5144.44
level try to commit suicide just to

5140.96 --> 5145.96
avoid it we could feel that about her

5144.44 --> 5149.199
like we just know that's just the way

5145.96 --> 5151.44
she is but yeah when then the pressure

5149.199 --> 5153.119
heightens and you just don't face

5151.44 --> 5155.239
reality and she was wasn't a bully or

5153.119 --> 5158.0
anything naturally thank

5155.239 --> 5160.44
God she had a bit of a streak sometimes

5158.0 --> 5163.48
when she was frustrated but she wouldn't

5160.44 --> 5166.4
like go bully people out there because

5163.48 --> 5169.08
of it if you do that and you just hang

5166.4 --> 5171.36
on to that forever and never resolve the

5169.08 --> 5173.0
actual problem just like if I do enough

5171.36 --> 5176.0
damage to other

5173.0 --> 5178.32
people then I can just forget how I can

5176.0 --> 5180.639
deal with reality yeah we keep doing

5178.32 --> 5184.5199999999995
that keep doing that very just keep it

5180.639 --> 5187.08
up because you get cancer when you do

5184.52 --> 5190.400000000001
that and that cancer ain't going to go

5187.08 --> 5194.8

Canadians though can somebody explain

5261.4 --> 5264.04
that to me

5271.119 --> 5274.36

autocorrect ever it sucks it's always G

5316.719 --> 5321.04
to you can't make joke you can't make

5336.639 --> 5342.119
I don't know is there something Canadian

5338.639 --> 5346.08
about me is it the temper

5342.119 --> 5348.599999999999
perhaps I don't know why there's like I

5346.08 --> 5350.719
mean I get Americans too but I I just

5348.6 --> 5352.679
seem to have a lot of Canadians that

5350.719 --> 5356.719
eventually kind of stick

5352.679 --> 5356.719
around why why is that I

5357.52 --> 5362.280000000001
wonder is it because of a Dutch

5360.36 --> 5364.839999999999
connection because there's like a a lot

5362.28 --> 5368.04
of sympathy between the Netherlands and

5364.84 --> 5371.2390000000005
can Canada for some reason including

5368.04 --> 5374.8
with the really bad factors because our

5371.239 --> 5377.36
disgusting government people cartel

5374.8 --> 5380.6
fascists they're like really in love

5377.36 --> 5382.96
with Trudeau and all that [ __ ]

5380.6 --> 5384.96
so there's something between the

5382.96 --> 5387.679
Netherlands and

5384.96 --> 5390.4
Canada we have a lot of Dutch here okay

5387.679 --> 5390.4
that that could

5390.92 --> 5395.4
help

5392.679 --> 5395.4
maybe it's that

5400.4 --> 5404.32
then goggle instead

5404.92 --> 5408.1990000000005

5481.36 --> 5483.759999999999
nabe

5493.32 --> 5498.199
duper it all depends you know like they

5496.719 --> 5500.84
may hate us

5498.199 --> 5504.638999999999
because we're

5500.84 --> 5509.0
different but in actuality we're not

5504.639 --> 5512.52
different we're the same they just chose

5509.0 --> 5516.239
poorly I always like to well not always

5512.52 --> 5518.1990000000005
I on occasion like to reference back to

5516.239 --> 5521.28
Indiana Jones and

5518.199 --> 5522.239
the the holy grill or what the [ __ ] was

5521.28 --> 5525.5599999999995
it

5522.239 --> 5529.199
called you know which one the

5525.56 --> 5532.4800000000005
third like you chose poorly I mean it is

5529.199 --> 5536.599999999999
that we're the same they just chose the

5532.48 --> 5540.678999999999
wrong thing like a long time ago they

5536.6 --> 5543.679
chose to be on the wrong side of the

5540.679 --> 5543.679
battle

5549.119 --> 5557.0
spiritually yeah the wrong side of the

5552.04 --> 5559.04
battle being the one where it's

5557.0 --> 5561.08
easier less

5559.04 --> 5565.44
hassle more

5561.08 --> 5568.32
benefits more lies less self-control

5565.44 --> 5570.119
less self-reliance more manipulation of

5568.32 --> 5573.08
you and what you really

5570.119 --> 5577.08
want the wrong side of the

5573.08 --> 5579.5199999999995
battle yeah you should be on the side

5577.08 --> 5582.92
that is the

5579.52 --> 5586.76
toughest the most challenging the most

5582.92 --> 5590.2390000000005
isolating the most painful the most

5586.76 --> 5590.2390000000005
depressing the most

5591.04 --> 5598.88
invigorating that's the side it's the

5594.44 --> 5598.879999999999
toughest side is the only right

5600.32 --> 5606.119
choice the toughest challenge is the

5603.6 --> 5606.119000000001
only

5606.88 --> 5610.4800000000005
challenge that is worth

5622.28 --> 5626.679
it right so it's like they hate us

5625.119 --> 5630.5599999999995
because they Ain

5626.679 --> 5632.36
us well they are they just chose

5630.56 --> 5634.96
poorly

5632.36 --> 5637.48
and they're like regretting it so

5634.96 --> 5639.96
they're like regretting their poor

5637.48 --> 5641.839999999999
choices that are like rooted in their

5639.96 --> 5643.159
entire life so they can't just like flip

5641.84 --> 5645.88
it around

5643.159 --> 5647.96
again without Crum letting everything

5645.88 --> 5651.8
crumble and like why would they do

5647.96 --> 5654.159
that they've hung on for so long at some

5651.8 --> 5655.679
point you can't stop hanging on even if

5654.159 --> 5658.04
you don't want to

5655.679 --> 5660.4800000000005
anymore yeah they can't changee they

5658.04 --> 5664.04
chose poorly and now they're stuck with

5660.48 --> 5667.599999999999
that and so they want to emphasize how

5664.04 --> 5667.6
they are different from

5667.639 --> 5672.88
us not realizing that they're actually

5670.6 --> 5675.360000000001
the same they just chose

5672.88 --> 5676.719
poorly and they're regretting it just

5675.36 --> 5679.28
like I

5676.719 --> 5682.32
regret some of the things like the Dark

5679.28 --> 5685.5199999999995
World Experience like I really regret

5682.32 --> 5688.639
having done that when all I would have

5685.52 --> 5692.159000000001
ever really needed to do was just like

5688.639 --> 5695.92
forget all that nonsense just figure out

5692.159 --> 5699.0
a working career be have humility in it

5695.92 --> 5702.4
like let yourself be humiliated by

5699.0 --> 5706.119
people let yourself be degraded like

5702.4 --> 5709.04
yeah I am just one little person I might

5706.119 --> 5711.639
have a mind but I'm not really that

5709.04 --> 5715.76
smart I'm not that good and just let

5711.639 --> 5718.2390000000005
other people be like they just need that

5715.76 --> 5721.8
to to survive and I should have just let

5718.239 --> 5724.5199999999995
it all happen get used to basically

5721.8 --> 5726.639
being pushed down by other people and I

5724.52 --> 5730.8
would have had a working career now I

5726.639 --> 5733.2390000000005
might have had an actual family now yeah

5730.8 --> 5737.119000000001
I regret it

5733.239 --> 5741.48
enormously it like hurts on a regular

5737.119 --> 5741.48
basis the path my life has

5741.76 --> 5748.0
taken and I knew it back then I as it

5745.199 --> 5751.44
was happening and like the opportunity

5748.0 --> 5755.4
was like seeping away it was pain it was

5751.44 --> 5756.719
continual pain I saw this hellish light

5755.4 --> 5759.5599999999995
around

5756.719 --> 5762.159
me and I wanted to discuss that for a

5759.56 --> 5763.719
bit this the several different types of

5762.159 --> 5765.36
experience within the Dark World and

5763.719 --> 5768.28
they're very

5765.36 --> 5771.5599999999995
significant you see the times in the

5768.28 --> 5775.04
Dark World experiences all of it where

5771.56 --> 5777.6
the light is shining really bright it's

5775.04 --> 5781.0
like everything emanates

5777.6 --> 5783.400000000001
light yeah like it does and in the Dark

5781.0 --> 5786.8
World you see it but when the light is

5783.4 --> 5790.04
really bright you know what that is what

5786.8 --> 5794.159000000001
that was every time when the light is

5790.04 --> 5797.159
bright it's like an invite but it's all

5794.159 --> 5797.159
devilish

5797.32 --> 5803.119
yeah the light was evil it was an evil

5800.96 --> 5806.6
light it was bright and it was evil and

5803.119 --> 5810.5199999999995
that's how I know it's evil I know that

5806.6 --> 5812.4400000000005
now and I sort of intuitively got that

5810.52 --> 5814.96
as I was going through it because

5812.44 --> 5818.04
despite like oh it's

5814.96 --> 5821.0
bright but I could feel I could still

5818.04 --> 5824.56
have the sense of my heart like this is

5821.0 --> 5828.48
evil but it was so bright it was like a

5824.56 --> 5832.719
bright evil light shining from certain

5828.48 --> 5836.0
things from certain moments and

5832.719 --> 5838.28
people like a weird moment in which I

5836.0 --> 5841.48
would be confronted with Hillary Clinton

5838.28 --> 5843.32
which is like why why I'm so not

5841.48 --> 5846.879999999999
interested in that person never have

5843.32 --> 5850.92
been really it's just this bright evil

5846.88 --> 5855.400000000001
light coming from her and everywhere she

5850.92 --> 5858.4
was and later later on in the

5855.4 --> 5860.119
chronological sequence of the Visions

5858.4 --> 5863.598999999999
there wouldn't be any Bright Lights

5860.119 --> 5865.598999999999
anymore it would all be dark a complete

5863.599 --> 5867.2390000000005
that's also how I ended up calling it

5865.599 --> 5869.360000000001
The Dark World because it was just

5867.239 --> 5873.48
continually surrounded by dark and it

5869.36 --> 5876.239
felt really lonely and isolated but it

5873.48 --> 5880.0
was good it was good that it was that

5876.239 --> 5882.32
because that means no evil there was no

5880.0 --> 5884.28
evil that surrounded me and that's why

5882.32 --> 5887.159
there wasn't a lot of bright lights and

5884.28 --> 5892.32
it was just dark and alone and it was

5887.159 --> 5896.5199999999995
better it was better that way no evil no

5892.32 --> 5897.96
more entangling somehow with evil the

5896.52 --> 5900.719
bright light of

5897.96 --> 5903.679
evil because that is what it was it

5900.719 --> 5906.599
could feel my heart never got it

5903.679 --> 5908.76
wrong and like afterward after I

5906.599 --> 5911.679
consciously learned about like who the

5908.76 --> 5913.04
hell is Hillary Clinton right and all

5911.679 --> 5915.679
these people and what they were doing

5913.04 --> 5919.159
and what they were planning I knew

5915.679 --> 5921.36
afterward learning like yeah my heart

5919.159 --> 5924.638999999999
didn't betray me my heart felt it what I

5921.36 --> 5927.239
didn't understand like it was evil and

5924.639 --> 5929.32
the light was like evil it was an evil

5927.239 --> 5931.839999999999
seduction like trying to oh it's so

5929.32 --> 5933.759999999999
bright oh so beautiful

5931.84 --> 5936.599
but it was evil and I could still feel

5933.76 --> 5939.08
it if I didn't have that

5936.599 --> 5941.1990000000005
heart basically telling me like this

5939.08 --> 5944.96
something really wrong

5941.199 --> 5948.919999999999
here then I might have been like a

5944.96 --> 5950.8
complete surrender to like sjw [ __ ] I

5948.92 --> 5952.36
might have become like part of this

5950.8 --> 5955.96
[ __ ] deep

5952.36 --> 5958.598999999999
state but I couldn't my heart stopped me

5955.96 --> 5960.4
it made me see it for what it was even

5958.599 --> 5963.04
though I didn't consciously understand

5960.4 --> 5963.04
it

5964.159 --> 5968.28
and that worked throughout the Dark

5965.679 --> 5971.56
World Visions way better than in real

5968.28 --> 5976.8
life by the way because in real

5971.56 --> 5979.4800000000005
life I didn't I didn't know the

5976.8 --> 5982.0
difference I would look at like

5979.48 --> 5986.4
politicians saying things and I would

5982.0 --> 5988.92
fall for it I couldn't see it my parents

5986.4 --> 5991.839999999999
and my brother were like embarrassed

5988.92 --> 5994.119
about me because I just just wouldn't

5991.84 --> 5996.159000000001
see it I couldn't see they had to

5994.119 --> 5999.96
explain it and I would be like I don't

5996.159 --> 6003.44
understand I don't like I couldn't

5999.96 --> 6006.84
stop falling for

6003.44 --> 6010.4
it but yeah if anything the

6006.84 --> 6013.08
Visions after that moment that

6010.4 --> 6015.638999999999
stopped so maybe that is the function of

6013.08 --> 6018.679
the Visions it was basically to burn the

6015.639 --> 6021.719
naivity out of me maybe that is what it

6018.679 --> 6027.52
was I don't know for sure but I know

6021.719 --> 6027.52
that after that I never like

6031.0 --> 6038.32
fell OBS is just really acting

6035.239 --> 6041.4
weird all right anybody still here still

6038.32 --> 6041.4
following what I'm talking

6041.639 --> 6046.84
about that part of the Visions maybe

6044.28 --> 6049.84
that it was a function maybe it was

6046.84 --> 6052.159000000001
there because I was just so perpetually

6049.84 --> 6054.719
naive about evil

6052.159 --> 6058.32
like I was so insistent that evil

6054.719 --> 6062.679
couldn't exist that I would fall for

6058.32 --> 6066.719
anything I was that person I was like

6062.679 --> 6068.84
mortifyingly naive about evil like I did

6066.719 --> 6074.04
not recognize that it was real like know

6068.84 --> 6074.04
it can't be real evil can't be

6074.48 --> 6080.159
real I was like

6076.8 --> 6082.679
that and it's terrifying and it was

6080.159 --> 6085.36
worrisome for my parents because I had

6082.679 --> 6088.76
this weird naive streak and it would get

6085.36 --> 6091.32
me in trouble it would literally get me

6088.76 --> 6093.56
in trouble including with [ __ ]

6091.32 --> 6097.04
bullies that figure that out about me

6093.56 --> 6099.8
and then just played me with that [ __ ]

6097.04 --> 6102.88
and I would just fully fall for it and

6099.8 --> 6105.320000000001
been enormously humiliating it made me

6102.88 --> 6108.1990000000005
feel like a complete [ __ ] like what

6105.32 --> 6111.28
the [ __ ] is wrong with me why can't I

6108.199 --> 6113.96
just see it why can't I just see see

6111.28 --> 6116.96
that they're [ __ ] lying to me why

6113.96 --> 6116.96
couldn't I see

6127.119 --> 6130.839999999999
it but now I

6133.36 --> 6139.759999999999
can after divisions I could so maybe

6136.88 --> 6142.4800000000005
that is it maybe I went through all that

6139.76 --> 6145.679
hell just to

6142.48 --> 6149.0
make sure that I could now see it that

6145.679 --> 6152.4
the naivity in me would be destroyed

6149.0 --> 6154.639
forever in that case I'm really glad I'm

6152.4 --> 6157.08
really glad that it happened then it was

6154.639 --> 6161.36
like the most horrific experience I

6157.08 --> 6164.0
could ever imagine though but I mean at

6161.36 --> 6167.4
least I'm not that [ __ ] naive anymore

6164.0 --> 6167.4
at least that's finally

6169.52 --> 6175.56
stopped but yeah that naivity was a very

6173.639 --> 6178.8
very serious

6175.56 --> 6182.639
problem a problem that was not addressed

6178.8 --> 6182.639
sufficiently by my parents as

6183.44 --> 6188.839999999999
well like my naivity made me too

6186.44 --> 6193.239
comfortable I was too comfortable I

6188.84 --> 6196.4800000000005
could like literally just if you don't

6193.239 --> 6199.119
see evil then it can't hurt you and it

6196.48 --> 6202.759999999999
was very free in that state I was like

6199.119 --> 6206.36
Yay I love the world it's all good like

6202.76 --> 6209.2390000000005
no no it's literally all good evil can't

6206.36 --> 6213.799999999999
exist I was so

6209.239 --> 6217.919999999999
happy not knowing evil even as I was

6213.8 --> 6217.92
being fooled by it it's like I was so

6219.96 --> 6224.2390000000005
happy but it was so [ __ ] dangerous

6223.239 --> 6229.678999999999
and

6224.239 --> 6232.678999999999
delusional I was so off with my

6229.679 --> 6232.679
naivity

6236.239 --> 6241.839999999999
I I don't know are you guys making any

6238.8 --> 6241.84
sense of what I'm talking

6254.36 --> 6260.0
about and thanks for staying here by the

6257.119 --> 6262.08
way blue pill Evolution after that 11

6260.0 --> 6264.639
minute pause but I was rambling so

6262.08 --> 6264.639
that's fair

6277.44 --> 6285.199
enough it's just that like I had this

6280.679 --> 6287.36
protected childhood in a way I did I was

6285.199 --> 6289.5599999999995
protected from

6287.36 --> 6291.159
Evil to an

6289.56 --> 6292.0
extent

6291.159 --> 6293.799999999999
but

6292.0 --> 6299.76
then I

6293.8 --> 6304.159000000001
didn't really grow out of it I held on

6299.76 --> 6307.1990000000005
it was too painful it felt like if

6304.159 --> 6309.44
I like I couldn't consciously let go I

6307.199 --> 6312.44
couldn't decide to stop it it's like

6309.44 --> 6316.32
grow up Arwin it's like how do I do it I

6312.44 --> 6318.839999999999
just can't see it how do I do it all the

6316.32 --> 6322.92
freaking Dark World Vision

6318.84 --> 6327.56
[ __ ] it did that all right oh my god did

6322.92 --> 6331.76
it do that after I came out of it I knew

6327.56 --> 6335.320000000001
evil Beyond Your Wildest nightmares I

6331.76 --> 6338.599
had seen things in there that I would

6335.32 --> 6342.159
have never even had remote curiosity

6338.599 --> 6343.88
checking out it was so horrific the

6342.159 --> 6347.159
things that I've seen in there like I

6343.88 --> 6350.92
will never describe that to anyone even

6347.159 --> 6353.48
on a one-on-one basis off the Record

6350.92 --> 6356.76
things that I've seen there I I and I

6353.48 --> 6360.5599999999995
can barely I just know it went pretty

6356.76 --> 6360.56
much just beyond

6368.52 --> 6371.56
description we're all guilty of what

6370.679 --> 6374.679
you're

6371.56 --> 6376.639
saying yeah but are that fanatically

6374.679 --> 6378.4800000000005
though yeah there's things that you just

6376.639 --> 6380.76
you don't really want to like accept

6378.48 --> 6383.638999999999
that but you'll still know there's evil

6380.76 --> 6386.719
I was like to the point where like no no

6383.639 --> 6390.1990000000005
evil doesn't exist it's an

6386.719 --> 6393.28
illusion it's just being

6390.199 --> 6396.08
misunderstood and philosophically I can

6393.28 --> 6399.5199999999995
in a way still stand behind it weirdly

6396.08 --> 6401.5599999999995
enough like logically technically like

6399.52 --> 6405.0
yeah evil is a

6401.56 --> 6407.119000000001
mistake it's just that it's

6405.0 --> 6409.88
completely it's a

6407.119 --> 6411.839999999999
mistake out there that is just grown out

6409.88 --> 6415.32
of control control it's a compounding

6411.84 --> 6415.32
mistake and it will never

6415.56 --> 6423.639
stop it's a mistake that can grow out of

6420.56 --> 6423.639
[Music]

6439.32 --> 6445.199
control

6442.239 --> 6447.199
yes you have to somehow find a middle

6445.199 --> 6449.5599999999995
ground yeah it's

6447.199 --> 6453.48
like what is this ground I'm going to

6449.56 --> 6459.96
stand on is it the hot sizzling red

6453.48 --> 6459.959999999999
metal plate or is it the zero

6460.96 --> 6466.719
Kelvin metal plate yeah which

6464.719 --> 6469.32
one

6466.719 --> 6472.32
like how the [ __ ] do you find a middle

6469.32 --> 6472.32
ground

6477.28 --> 6483.4
the it it's like almost illogical to

6480.639 --> 6483.400000000001
find the middle

6492.96 --> 6498.119
ground it just for me it just ends up

6495.96 --> 6503.28
with like I want to be good and I want

6498.119 --> 6503.28
to be so good that I become

6503.56 --> 6510.92
evil it's like I end up just like being

6507.08 --> 6515.159
evil against evil like I will have no

6510.92 --> 6518.32
limitations to try to like destroy evil

6515.159 --> 6521.199
no limitations like I know I can I know

6518.32 --> 6521.199
I can do those

6522.44 --> 6530.28
things I hate evil so much I hate it so

6527.04 --> 6535.0
much it's like there's nothing that I

6530.28 --> 6538.08
couldn't do to make evil suffer or

6535.0 --> 6542.119
extinguish or discourage it there's no

6538.08 --> 6542.119
limitations to how far I could go with

6544.32 --> 6550.08
that like and it makes me nervous

6547.52 --> 6550.080000000001
knowing

6550.4 --> 6556.36
that because other people will see me do

6554.239 --> 6559.28
those things and they will have in their

6556.36 --> 6563.159
mind that guy's evil forever and nothing

6559.28 --> 6563.159
in their mind will convince them

6566.84 --> 6572.1990000000005
otherwise like there's no middle ground

6569.4 --> 6572.199
it just doesn't

6580.53 --> 6585.759999999999
[Music]

6582.84 --> 6588.96
exist that's really bug let you go and

6585.76 --> 6591.52
admire yeah but the was the net result

6588.96 --> 6597.08
of that blue pill that evolution is I

6591.52 --> 6598.639
have to somehow turn my feelings off

6597.08 --> 6601.44
completely

6598.639 --> 6606.719
then it's like almost a quest like how

6601.44 --> 6611.0
can I just not feel anymore like

6606.719 --> 6614.199
anything because all my feelings is just

6611.0 --> 6614.199
going to do those

6616.52 --> 6620.599
things it will make me care it will hurt

6619.679 --> 6624.32
me

6620.599 --> 6624.32
it will make me want to change

6624.56 --> 6630.76
things it will get in my

6627.56 --> 6635.080000000001
way of changing those things that I want

6630.76 --> 6635.08
it's like it's just

6637.04 --> 6643.4
I like I actively sought I actively

6640.44 --> 6647.96
sought to like how do I turn off my

6643.4 --> 6653.48
feelings forever how do I do

6647.96 --> 6656.36
it I've actively tried it and it didn't

6653.48 --> 6659.839999999999
work it would suppress

6656.36 --> 6662.639
it then eventually hallucinations would

6659.84 --> 6666.56
start and then I'd like break out in

6662.639 --> 6669.719
hysterical Madness and anguish and then

6666.56 --> 6673.56
it would all come back all of it it's

6669.719 --> 6677.0
like I can't I can't turn it off it's a

6673.56 --> 6680.119000000001
[ __ ] nightmare I can't turn it

6677.0 --> 6682.36
off like I can't turn the pain off I

6680.119 --> 6685.839999999999
can't just say oh just ignore them like

6682.36 --> 6688.4
I can't I I can like not respond but I

6685.84 --> 6691.76
can't make it stop hurting I don't know

6688.4 --> 6695.759999999999
how to do that I never have I'm [ __ ]

6691.76 --> 6698.56
44 and I still don't know how to do that

6695.76 --> 6701.76
and I've like dealt with this [ __ ] all

6698.56 --> 6705.599
my life on a [ __ ] daily basis I still

6701.76 --> 6705.599
don't know how to turn it

6707.1 --> 6711.96
[Music]

6708.96 --> 6711.96
off

6727.24 --> 6730.3099999999995
[Music]

6733.28 --> 6737.84
although just watching something that's

6735.32 --> 6741.88
good and has good energy does kind of

6737.84 --> 6741.88
help in a way

6742.199 --> 6746.44
like yesterday I was really [ __ ]

6744.239 --> 6750.159
miserable for a while then I continued

6746.44 --> 6754.598999999999
watching that video that you linked the

6750.159 --> 6754.598999999999
Christian Explorer what what was

6756.239 --> 6762.678999999999
that there was a really good vibe in

6758.84 --> 6765.52
those videos like very pure no no

6762.679 --> 6768.4
pushiness or anything and that kind of

6765.52 --> 6770.96
fixed me a bit just listening to that

6768.4 --> 6775.5199999999995
the Christian Observer that's it

6770.96 --> 6778.639
right I just watched that and it did

6775.52 --> 6780.88
actually calm me down in a way is also

6778.639 --> 6783.1990000000005
because there's just like literal

6780.88 --> 6785.96
references like things that are talked

6783.199 --> 6787.48
about in there I have personally

6785.96 --> 6790.8
experienc

6787.48 --> 6793.5199999999995
that like the whole oh the the snakes in

6790.8 --> 6796.88
the genetics and they're oh we we just

6793.52 --> 6799.96
trying we just came from above from the

6796.88 --> 6802.4800000000005
mean person like I have experienced that

6799.96 --> 6805.84
I've literally seen that in the Dark

6802.48 --> 6807.4
World at the beginning guess what I was

6805.84 --> 6811.52
completely

6807.4 --> 6812.839999999999
unfed completely you know why my heart

6811.52 --> 6816.84
my

6812.84 --> 6821.1990000000005
heart it revealed nobody told me this

6816.84 --> 6825.2390000000005
[ __ ] yeah it just I saw it and it's

6821.199 --> 6827.44
like they're literally the devil like

6825.239 --> 6830.44
those things that's the devil I'm not

6827.44 --> 6833.159
falling for their [ __ ] stupid trick

6830.44 --> 6835.638999999999
trick I got to see it and I just knew

6833.159 --> 6838.239
like I'm not listening to anything that

6835.639 --> 6841.1990000000005
you got to say you are the [ __ ] devil

6838.239 --> 6843.919999999999
You Are The Same Spirit that is at the

6841.199 --> 6846.919999999999
core of Marxism I could feel it I could

6843.92 --> 6851.4800000000005
feel that they're all

6846.92 --> 6851.4800000000005
lies however spectacular it

6854.34 --> 6857.439
[Music]

6858.679 --> 6861.679
seemed

6873.4 --> 6877.4
yes that's right psychological condition

6876.32 --> 6880.88
it's a

6877.4 --> 6883.719
sensitivity like it is that

6880.88 --> 6888.0
sensitivity but I just I can't turn it

6883.719 --> 6888.0
off either blue build

6888.679 --> 6894.4800000000005
evolution

6891.52 --> 6897.119000000001
like it's a it's like if I turn it off

6894.48 --> 6899.598999999999
then it's completely then I have to like

6897.119 --> 6901.639
permanently seal it in a way I don't

6899.599 --> 6904.719
think I can because when I tried that in

6901.639 --> 6907.76
the past it would literally like unravel

6904.719 --> 6910.119
and unseal and explode open and I would

6907.76 --> 6912.639
become completely

6910.119 --> 6914.92
hysterical it's like my emotions just

6912.639 --> 6918.52
forc themselves out

6914.92 --> 6920.76
again like it might be like an intrical

6918.52 --> 6924.119000000001
spiritual part of me that like no matter

6920.76 --> 6927.04
what I do I just can't change it ever I

6924.119 --> 6929.44
don't know I've kind of surrendered to

6927.04 --> 6931.079
it because after trying that [ __ ] like

6929.44 --> 6933.36
at some point you're just like there's

6931.079 --> 6935.119
no more point in trying this I'm just

6933.36 --> 6938.92
going to end up physically hurting

6935.119 --> 6940.719
myself trying this maybe causing brain

6938.92 --> 6944.4400000000005
damage that's

6940.719 --> 6945.76
not beneficial in any form I don't want

6944.44 --> 6948.4
to do

6945.76 --> 6950.400000000001
that like it's already challenging

6948.4 --> 6953.839999999999
enough the way I am I don't want to make

6950.4 --> 6953.839999999999
it physically more

6954.0 --> 6957.639
challenging God

6958.119 --> 6964.239
meds dude I'd be [ __ ] dead 10 years

6961.159 --> 6966.598999999999
ago if I tried that

6964.239 --> 6969.119
route

6966.599 --> 6972.1990000000005
God that because that's kind of what my

6969.119 --> 6976.839999999999
mother tried yeah

6972.199 --> 6976.839999999999
yeah yeah she died in

6978.52 --> 6985.84
2006

6980.84 --> 6990.679
yeah which is like she was

6985.84 --> 6992.88
56 think around that so that's what

6990.679 --> 6994.639
happens when you go when you try to go

6992.88 --> 6996.76
that round and it didn't work like my

6994.639 --> 6998.76
mother had similar issues like she would

6996.76 --> 7002.159000000001
just like not get her feelings under

6998.76 --> 7003.280000000001
control at all and she would like just

7002.159 --> 7004.92
blow

7003.28 --> 7008.48
herself

7004.92 --> 7012.32
out by taking meds that were just

7008.48 --> 7015.5599999999995
like like numb

7012.32 --> 7018.84
her but it all just made it worse like

7015.56 --> 7021.76
her trying to like prevent it from being

7018.84 --> 7025.159000000001
the way it is would just make it worse

7021.76 --> 7025.159000000001
afterward every [ __ ]

7025.8 --> 7031.28
time my mother damaged herself with

7028.92 --> 7034.2390000000005
Pharmaceuticals because of similar

7031.28 --> 7034.239
issues is what I

7038.4 --> 7045.4
have right although she never really had

7041.76 --> 7045.400000000001
like the rage Factor like I

7046.679 --> 7051.28
do she was never

7049.56 --> 7054.0
rage

7051.28 --> 7057.239
ragy she would just go hysterical

7054.0 --> 7060.96
instead so there was never any any

7057.239 --> 7064.5599999999995
potential for constructivity out of that

7060.96 --> 7067.599
flame unlike with me where I have

7064.56 --> 7070.079000000001
been able to kind of figure out like how

7067.599 --> 7071.4400000000005
do I manage these aspects of of myself

7070.079 --> 7074.0
that I can

7071.44 --> 7077.5599999999995
like make it

7074.0 --> 7079.199
acceptable get something out of it my

7077.56 --> 7083.679
mother just couldn't do

7079.199 --> 7083.678999999999
that she just had to suppress

7091.239 --> 7096.839999999999
everything yeah it is a

7094.199 --> 7098.119
shock although that's not necessarily

7096.84 --> 7101.1990000000005
evil

7098.119 --> 7104.159
though that people all die it's not

7101.199 --> 7106.44
necessarily evil the more pain you

7104.159 --> 7109.92
experience the more you'll be relieved

7106.44 --> 7113.44
to the notion that it's going to end one

7109.92 --> 7115.679
day I'm already there in ways like I've

7113.44 --> 7118.5599999999995
already set through enough [ __ ]

7115.679 --> 7120.8
torture to be like yeah like I'm not

7118.56 --> 7124.400000000001
going to do it but I mean I'm almost

7120.8 --> 7126.719
looking forward to dying really because

7124.4 --> 7128.32
then then this shit's like finally going

7126.719 --> 7131.32
to

7128.32 --> 7131.32
end

7132.44 --> 7136.4
and it's not because

7138.36 --> 7142.598999999999
evil well maybe it is it's just that's

7141.199 --> 7145.5599999999995
just what it

7142.599 --> 7146.92
is this world is what it is and it was

7145.56 --> 7150.56
always

7146.92 --> 7153.96
evil it's just more in your face about

7150.56 --> 7157.52
it now more conscious of it now that's

7153.96 --> 7160.96
the only difference it was always like

7157.52 --> 7164.1990000000005
this yeah trolling Elite have always

7160.96 --> 7167.84
been brutally

7164.199 --> 7170.719
evil very willing to murder and

7167.84 --> 7174.28
annihilate

7170.719 --> 7178.079
innocence always it's always been like

7174.28 --> 7178.079
that never it was

7188.239 --> 7191.239
different

7211.89 --> 7215.029
[Music]

7218.159 --> 7221.159
what

7222.03 --> 7229.938999999999
[Music]

7233.28 --> 7238.8
you never felt connected to this world I

7236.119 --> 7240.759999999999
can feel that about you duper and that's

7238.8 --> 7242.719
I could feel that the first time I saw

7240.76 --> 7245.119000000001
you talking in the chat it's part of the

7242.719 --> 7247.32
reason why I took you in as a

7245.119 --> 7249.799999999999
protectorate because you have that same

7247.32 --> 7251.04
issue you might even have it a bit more

7249.8 --> 7253.76
than I

7251.04 --> 7256.84
do CU there's plenty of things that I

7253.76 --> 7256.84
still feel connected

7263.44 --> 7266.638999999999
to all

7269.079 --> 7275.239
right but I mean look at like this you

7272.36 --> 7277.5599999999995
know in this struggle that can never be

7275.239 --> 7281.759999999999
one we could at least find other people

7277.56 --> 7284.76
that just that are with us alongside

7281.76 --> 7286.679
us so we're not alone it's like and

7284.76 --> 7289.719
that's part of the feelings you know of

7286.679 --> 7292.0
this [ __ ] and the [ __ ] world is that

7289.719 --> 7295.639
when you really find out about how dark

things can get and that like anybody

7295.639 --> 7301.36
will give up on you if you push it

7298.719 --> 7304.76
anybody like your own mother your own

7301.36 --> 7307.88

exception every everyone will give up on

7310.44 --> 7315.32
you if you push certain things it just

7312.599 --> 7318.32
happens and that makes you feel

7315.32 --> 7318.32
unbelievably

7318.599 --> 7323.1990000000005
alone and that's like really it's

7321.44 --> 7326.4

8597.359 --> 8599.640000000001
that's

8604.2 --> 8611.640000000001
crazy so they basically just texed you

8607.319 --> 8611.64
out of business immediately is that

glorified pan yeah and also just all

8707.52 --> 8713.24
these rules man

8709.12 --> 8715.92
like since the whole carbon credit [ __ ]

8713.24 --> 8718.359
happened like that's now being standard

8715.92 --> 8720.84
integrating with business models like

8718.359 --> 8723.04
how long until it just becomes standard

8720.84 --> 8726.24
practice for any business that you have

8723.04 --> 8729.439
to have a statue of molec in your

8726.24 --> 8732.64
business or like you won't be allowed to

8729.439 --> 8734.64
have a business like how long before

8732.64 --> 8738.8
that just slips in

8734.64 --> 8741.56
there with all this crap going on and

8738.8 --> 8743.92
people will just do it they will just do

8741.56 --> 8747.6
it because it's too much hassle to not

8743.92 --> 8748.92
do it like how long do we get to that

8747.6 --> 8751.800000000001
point where it's

8748.92 --> 8755.08
like yeah you can't have business unless

8751.8 --> 8757.319
you like give us a blood offering you

8755.08 --> 8759.76
have to sacrifice at least one of your

8757.319 --> 8763.6
children before you're allowed to have a

8759.76 --> 8766.479
business kind of thing like how long how

8763.6 --> 8766.479000000001
long is that going to

8770.56 --> 8775.519999999999
take and I know they already sort of

8773.24 --> 8778.439
allegedly doing that with like high

8775.52 --> 8781.880000000001
functions and Pops stars and [ __ ] but I

8778.439 --> 8785.0
mean how long before that's just even to

8781.88 --> 8785.0
have anything at

8786.64 --> 8790.92
all I don't know this a bit

8796.96 --> 8802.8
dark right but I mean yeah apparently if

8800.08 --> 8805.8
you start a business you have to like

8802.8 --> 8808.358999999999
consult a lawyer before you even start

8805.8 --> 8811.199999999999
anything just don't like how is this

8808.359 --> 8813.359
going to unroll how can I prevent these

8811.2 --> 8815.560000000001
[ __ ] bureaucrats from immediately

8813.359 --> 8818.16
shutting me

8815.56 --> 8820.8
down you need to have a lawyer before

8818.16 --> 8824.08
you even have a

8820.8 --> 8824.08
business like

8827.279 --> 8830.279
that

8835.72 --> 8838.72
crazy

8847.92 --> 8854.64
right but I mean like yeah Judicial

8851.8 --> 8859.0
System tax system like all this lawyer

8854.64 --> 8859.0
[ __ ] like it's getting completely out of

8859.04 --> 8866.2
control there needs to be like a a

8862.84 --> 8868.880000000001
universal World overhaul in this entire

8866.2 --> 8870.279
system like how business is done how all

8868.88 --> 8872.679999999998
these things are done it needs to be

8870.279 --> 8874.92
overhauled it's growing completely out

8872.68 --> 8874.92
of

8879.04 --> 8885.76
control sit down with the

8881.92 --> 8887.92
lawyer yeah I guess that's a total waste

8885.76 --> 8887.92
of

8891.72 --> 8895.64
money

8892.97 --> 8898.64
[Music]

8895.64 --> 8898.64
yeah

8907.359 --> 8912.359
right I I think it just works like you

8909.52 --> 8914.359
just have to basically suck the mayor's

8912.359 --> 8916.12
dick or something and then you can just

8914.359 --> 8919.279
start a business maybe it just works

8916.12 --> 8921.52
like that it's just like purely

8919.279 --> 8923.800000000001
that because everything else is a

8921.52 --> 8925.319000000001
complete waste of money I I think it

8923.8 --> 8927.278999999999
might be that it's just like yeah take

8925.319 --> 8929.92
the [ __ ] mark of the beast or get the

8927.279 --> 8932.08
[ __ ] out it might be working like that

8929.92 --> 8936.0
it might have been working like that for

8932.08 --> 8938.279
decades it just never was overtly

8936.0 --> 8940.68
official but that's the [ __ ] that I've

8938.279 --> 8943.800000000001
bumped into the

8940.68 --> 8947.04
guys there were people literally telling

8943.8 --> 8947.039999999999
me to do that

8952.72 --> 8958.519999999999
yeah yeah I didn't do that yeah

8959.279 --> 8963.319000000001
but I mean if you're faced with that

8961.72 --> 8967.0
kind of world

8963.319 --> 8967.0
like how can this

8972.279 --> 8978.76
survive like the whole thing is just

8975.439 --> 8982.279
held together by non-stop

8978.76 --> 8986.0
corruption it seems like all this

8982.279 --> 8988.800000000001
supposed freedom is just a gigantic lie

8986.0 --> 8991.0
it's all veneer it doesn't it's not

8988.8 --> 8992.119999999999
really there it all just comes down to

8991.0 --> 8996.279
like

8992.12 --> 8998.880000000001
yeah be blackmailed by us do whatever

8996.279 --> 9001.399000000001
the [ __ ] we want get yourself

8998.88 --> 9004.08
mortifyingly humiliating or make a

9001.399 --> 9007.439
brutal Psychopathic sacrifice of some

9004.08 --> 9011.08
kind or we'll just bully you out of

9007.439 --> 9013.800000000001
existence is that this world could be

9011.08 --> 9015.64
could be that it's really like that it

9013.8 --> 9017.96
seems to me like it's like that it

9015.64 --> 9020.278999999999
seemed to me like like that 20 years ago

9017.96 --> 9023.278999999999
30 years ago 10 years ago it seems like

9020.279 --> 9026.2
it's just like that and it's just this

9023.279 --> 9028.52
veneer this idea of freedom that you can

9026.2 --> 9032.279
do with all these things but you can't

9028.52 --> 9038.76
you really can't it's just the LIE they

9032.279 --> 9041.279
tell you to not remove them for the

9038.76 --> 9042.24
utter corruption that all these people

9041.279 --> 9045.439
stand

9042.24 --> 9048.439
for utter

9045.439 --> 9048.439
corruption

9063.319 --> 9067.88
right and makes me fantasize about weird

9065.84 --> 9071.0
things like

9067.88 --> 9074.64
hey what if it just make a law that

9071.0 --> 9078.8
under any circumstance like ever if

9074.64 --> 9080.56
somebody just tells you suck my dick or

9078.8 --> 9082.64
you don't get the contract that you

9080.56 --> 9085.16
literally in that moment you have to

9082.64 --> 9088.399
record it though you have to somehow

9085.16 --> 9090.479
record it if you get caught catch

9088.399 --> 9095.199999999999
somebody that says that that you just

9090.479 --> 9097.88
get blank right to [ __ ] execute them

9095.2 --> 9101.2
just shoot them dead and no

9097.88 --> 9103.88
prosecution how about that wouldn't that

9101.2 --> 9103.880000000001
be a world

9105.359 --> 9108.359
changer

9122.52 --> 9128.2
yeah but of course that's not going to

9124.8 --> 9130.24
happen because it's everywhere I mean I

9128.2 --> 9133.04
think it's all just become completely

9130.24 --> 9134.84
intable the corruption is so far it's

9133.04 --> 9138.080000000002
like the only thing that's left is to

9134.84 --> 9140.960000000001
just go to brutal Civil War and just

9138.08 --> 9144.039999999999
slaughter them slaughter them at all

9140.96 --> 9146.479
costs like it's worth it it's worth to

9144.04 --> 9148.880000000001
slaughter it's worth losing Society it's

9146.479 --> 9151.88
worth losing a lot of people it's worth

9148.88 --> 9157.319
losing people you love just to [ __ ]

9151.88 --> 9161.438999999998
get rid of all this corruption slaughter

9157.319 --> 9163.72
them it's worth it it's worth it

9161.439 --> 9167.92
everything that you're living out there

9163.72 --> 9170.56
is a lie it's all make believe pretend

9167.92 --> 9173.960000000001
hor [ __ ] and it all comes down to its

9170.56 --> 9176.08
pure blackmail power play power abuse

9173.96 --> 9180.08
that's all that's out

9176.08 --> 9183.039999999999
there you can rarely very rarely find an

9180.08 --> 9185.68
exception to that and when you do it

9183.04 --> 9188.479000000001
ain't going to last it's going to be

9185.68 --> 9191.92
torn down like anything else that

9188.479 --> 9194.319
refuses to submit to the absolute

9191.92 --> 9195.16
corruption that that is just prevalent

9194.319 --> 9198.119999999999
out

9195.16 --> 9202.64
there

9198.12 --> 9204.479000000001
be part of the demon group or you're out

9202.64 --> 9206.16
you don't get anything you don't get to

9204.479 --> 9210.24
own anything you don't get to do

9206.16 --> 9213.8
anything you don't get screen time you

9210.24 --> 9215.56
don't get access be part of the demon

9213.8 --> 9218.64
system or

9215.56 --> 9222.039999999999
die that's how it's working right now

9218.64 --> 9228.439
out there and it needs to end it needs

9222.04 --> 9230.0
to be stopped permanently at at Great

9228.439 --> 9234.76
sacrifice

9230.0 --> 9234.76
cuz it's not going to leave any other

9237.43 --> 9242.399
[Music]

9239.64 --> 9244.56
way but people have to decide it they

9242.399 --> 9247.56
have to decide it like yes we are going

9244.56 --> 9249.72
to stand up we are going to fight this

9247.56 --> 9252.64
Civil War and we are going to kill these

9249.72 --> 9257.479
corrupted people and we don't care about

9252.64 --> 9260.119999999999
the consequences for us for our children

9257.479 --> 9264.319
for the stability of the nation for

9260.12 --> 9268.359
anything the corruption must be

9264.319 --> 9270.96
exterminated at all cost and that's the

9268.359 --> 9275.0
only thing that could ever change this

9270.96 --> 9275.0
[ __ ] from growing ever

9278.24 --> 9283.359
worse it has to stop it must stop it

9282.08 --> 9288.08
must

9283.359 --> 9288.08
stop cannot be allowed to continue

9299.04 --> 9304.399000000001
continue right anyway you guys are not
