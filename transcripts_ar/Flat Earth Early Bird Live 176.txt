8.22 --> 43.14
[Music]

39.08 --> 47.64
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.14 --> 50.25
early-bird number 176 I'm your host

47.64 --> 53.82
Arwen and before we start the show

50.25 --> 55.11
please don't forget to share it and yeah

53.82 --> 57.36
subscribe to my channel if you haven't

55.11 --> 58.85
already and hit the bell notification so

57.36 --> 67.16
you know when I'm going live which is

58.85 --> 71.55
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time and so

67.16 --> 74.13
today the weather is kind of same like

71.55 --> 80.1
yesterday haven't seen it rain so far

74.13 --> 85.16
but it's fresh clouded not windy though

80.1 --> 85.16
a little i don't know it's not terrible

86.27 --> 97.619
put in the heater in the back just cuz i

92.33 --> 104.789
felt a little bit chilly here so yeah a

97.619 --> 109.679
lot has happened yesterday well yeah the

104.789 --> 112.95
debates were very presentation oriented

109.679 --> 119.28
apparently and again relative density

112.95 --> 121.89
and riley talking on about it and it

119.28 --> 124.619
felt like a mess to me and i tried to

121.89 --> 127.67
basically break in our wind style and it

124.619 --> 130.08
wasn't really appreciated and eventually

127.67 --> 134.4
Nathan and me got into the whole

130.08 --> 136.5
directions thing and I had things to say

134.4 --> 139.74
about it and he was basically just

136.5 --> 142.59
putting words in my mouth that I was

139.74 --> 145.44
trying to promote up and down and what I

142.59 --> 149.22
was basically trying to prove that there

145.44 --> 152.55
is a forced present yeah as resulting in

149.22 --> 155.01
the displacement and not a gravity field

152.55 --> 160.08
it's just the force comes into being

155.01 --> 164.04
when something of an average relative

160.08 --> 165.65900000000002
density is added this equality room in

164.04 --> 167.60999999999999
relation to the relative density

165.659 --> 170.82999999999998
spectrum of all things

167.61 --> 173.44000000000003
then the force comes into being and the

170.83 --> 175.99
displacement sets in normally with

173.44 --> 178.9
acceleration depending on what it medium

175.99 --> 180.22
it's going through and all that so yeah

178.9 --> 183.45000000000002
it is there it's just not caused by

180.22 --> 187.98
gravity it's not some Universal field

183.45 --> 192.60999999999999
doing all that provably so at least and

187.98 --> 194.56
I don't get why they're so so not

192.61 --> 196.81
wanting to get the force somehow

194.56 --> 198.67000000000002
involved even though displacement is

196.81 --> 201.97
taking place and this place when his

198.67 --> 204.57999999999998
motion and when motion when acceleration

201.97 --> 207.13
happens motion from a standstill point

204.58 --> 211.66000000000003
it is point oriented then a force comes

207.13 --> 214.39
into being and they really didn't like

211.66 --> 216.49
it and so I left because yeah

214.39 --> 218.52999999999997
Nathan was berating me over something

216.49 --> 220.9
that I wasn't saying and it annoyed me

218.53 --> 226.0
to no end because I thought I was making

220.9 --> 228.61
good points so I left pretty early on I

226.0 --> 233.44
guess halfway or something and then I

228.61 --> 238.47000000000003
eventually joined Jose's hangout which

233.44 --> 242.29
was baller riddled elf as usual and I

238.47 --> 244.48
don't know it was it was okay there was

242.29 --> 247.59
this satellite guy on I saw part of a

244.48 --> 251.26
presentation that he did earlier but

247.59 --> 253.48
satellites and all look he was really a

251.26 --> 258.489
big all he worked on satellites

253.48 --> 261.51
apparently so I I tested him as I do

258.489 --> 261.51
with people and

263.05 --> 269.45
yeah it didn't really hold up he was

266.6 --> 272.24
really trying to rum rumpus complicate

269.45 --> 276.55
things eventually to try and suggest

272.24 --> 279.38
that it was so absolutely necessary and

276.55 --> 283.76
it was funny because in a sort of final

279.38 --> 286.34
reaction before I left he made like an

283.76 --> 289.96999999999997
explanation very long-winded it didn't

286.34 --> 292.03999999999996
actually show the absolute necessity of

289.97 --> 294.59000000000003
satellites it didn't actually respond to

292.04 --> 296.36
the my counter arguments over the

294.59 --> 299.57
debates I don't know how much was

296.36 --> 301.18
audible of that so I don't know how much

299.57 --> 303.8
of you you got that

301.18 --> 307.07
or if you feelin seen it I don't know

303.8 --> 309.22
but should watch it but anyway I then

307.07 --> 311.24
responded okay what I got from this is

309.22 --> 312.89000000000004
satellites blah blah blah blah blah

311.24 --> 314.42
satellites blah blah blah satellites

312.89 --> 316.90999999999997
satellites blah blah blah satellites

314.42 --> 319.69
because he was just saying the word

316.91 --> 322.46000000000004
satellite and satellites so many times

319.69 --> 324.5
in his explanation I think it was five

322.46 --> 329.27
minutes and he must have said satellites

324.5 --> 333.11
or satellites at least 20 times maybe 30

329.27 --> 334.88
or something it was it was crazy and he

333.11 --> 337.19
didn't really make a point he was just

334.88 --> 340.04
using cybernetics to indoctrinate

337.19 --> 342.95
everyone by talking about satellites in

340.04 --> 348.29
a very positive way mentioning the word

342.95 --> 351.65
as much as possible and I think that

348.29 --> 354.05
overall it was an intriguing hangout and

351.65 --> 358.34
Jose posted the satellite satellite

354.05 --> 363.59000000000003
satellites explanation it's like 11

358.34 --> 366.46999999999997
second video I posted it earlier yeah

363.59 --> 368.67999999999995
that came from that anyway I got coffee

366.47 --> 368.68
again

370.44 --> 374.98
[Music]

371.98 --> 374.98
right

375.73 --> 384.31
well I I got I got the idea it was more

379.66 --> 387.58000000000004
a satellite dish technician yeah but he

384.31 --> 390.19
he definitely did understand all of the

387.58 --> 393.49
concepts of how satellites supposedly

390.19 --> 396.37
work he definitely knew a lot and I can

393.49 --> 401.32
kind of respect that I guess but he

396.37 --> 404.86
didn't really respond to the counter

401.32 --> 409.59999999999997
arguments just just using the towers as

404.86 --> 412.21000000000004
relays and the whole in the depth of the

409.6 --> 415.87
ocean how that like oh that supposedly

412.21 --> 416.46999999999997
cannot be reached that's that doesn't

415.87 --> 418.42
make sense

416.47 --> 420.04
it could be reached definitely but I

418.42 --> 423.88
never really got a chance even to

420.04 --> 426.42
explain that in detail it's all just

423.88 --> 426.42
lateral

429.61 --> 435.539
and who knows yet eventually we ended up

432.159 --> 437.56
okay if some disconnection thing this

435.539 --> 441.12899999999996
specific points connection that's

437.56 --> 443.53000000000003
fascinating to me I don't yeah I haven't

441.129 --> 446.8
tested these kind of things myself so I

443.53 --> 449.08
have to just go by their word for it but

446.8 --> 452.169
then yeah I suggest that well balloons

449.08 --> 454.24
you know maybe there's an air layer up

452.169 --> 456.18899999999996
there at some point we know there's air

454.24 --> 459.099
layers that definitely do have like

456.189 --> 461.40900000000005
constant streams but maybe there's an

459.099 --> 467.62
air layer at some point where things

461.409 --> 471.25
just hang very very still and if you can

467.62 --> 473.919
get a balloon balloons relative density

471.25 --> 476.8
in the satellite hanging from it exactly

473.919 --> 479.349
or tuned correctly to hang into that

476.8 --> 485.949
layer then yeah you'd have a very stable

479.349 --> 487.81
hanging thing so yeah that that could be

485.949 --> 489.789
a way to achieve pretty much the same

487.81 --> 492.37
thing with balloons satellites which we

489.789 --> 495.43
know are used and I even show the video

492.37 --> 501.159
of that again the balloon satellite

495.43 --> 503.409
launched so wasn't responded to a lot

501.159 --> 506.65
either it was it was very interesting

503.409 --> 509.469
and if I were the noteworthy of it so

506.65 --> 513.88
talking about balloons I also have a

509.469 --> 517.409
guest with me or at least he may be

513.88 --> 517.409
waiting in Skype to join

518.0 --> 521.09
[Music]

522.19 --> 531.58
mind-warped he wanted to talk about a

525.52 --> 536.49
project that he's really enthusiastic

531.58 --> 536.49
about so mind-warped get in my panel

539.3 --> 548.74
you okay then just

553.4 --> 556.6999999999999
[Music]

557.37 --> 564.72
Oh Nathan just alright Nathan's open up

561.51 --> 569.72
that's really early I'm putting up his

564.72 --> 569.72
panel anyway

578.82 --> 583.82
I'm drinking this coffee quickly because

581.13 --> 583.82
it's getting cold

591.38 --> 600.35
hmm no class on today to kind of keep

595.74 --> 607.26
down my budget a-and I see mind warps

600.35 --> 609.62
hey uh hey doing great how are you good

607.26 --> 609.62
thanks

610.47 --> 618.15
yeah our good evening I think right you

615.33 --> 623.07
were in Australia right you're yeah yeah

618.15 --> 629.34
yeah all right so it's evening there it

623.07 --> 633.69
is eight o'clock all right yeah right so

629.34 --> 637.49
okay yeah you you had a project in mind

633.69 --> 641.3100000000001
would you like to share it with everyone

637.49 --> 643.23
yeah Oh sister is trying so he's my life

641.31 --> 646.65
really there yeah oh you're coming

643.23 --> 648.72
through loud and clear to me people in

646.65 --> 650.91
chat complaining about it just default

648.72 --> 656.1
is are all the volumes okay

650.91 --> 656.5799999999999
in chat anyway keep keep talking no it's

656.1 --> 658.8000000000001
all good

656.58 --> 661.7900000000001
yeah so these basically I had an idea to

658.8 --> 664.77
get high of achieved with a bloom I

661.79 --> 667.38
noticed it's been done before but um I

664.77 --> 672.41
was looking at getting the maximum which

667.38 --> 677.88
he got to the it was forty kilometers

672.41 --> 679.53
which is quite quiet I originally was

677.88 --> 680.73
going to think about chattering it but I

679.53 --> 682.14
don't think that's gonna work it's just

680.73 --> 686.82
going away too much so I'm gonna have to

682.14 --> 689.88
implement a GPS system so basically send

686.82 --> 692.46
it up off come down find coordinates and

689.88 --> 694.11
get it but so obviously gonna be a

692.46 --> 696.9300000000001
little bit expensive so I'm gonna set up

694.11 --> 699.51
a GoFundMe and see if people wanted to

696.93 --> 703.9799999999999
get involved and trying to do an

699.51 --> 707.9399999999999
observation so like an unbiased Road

703.98 --> 710.9
flat whatever come in do it in and yeah

707.94 --> 712.6600000000001
I really want to try and find out

710.9 --> 714.009
getting the really good

712.66 --> 715.959
equipment so like you know you're not

714.009 --> 718.149
just the GoPro with a fisheye lens I

715.959 --> 720.4899999999999
want to try and find it the camera

718.149 --> 722.889
that's going to have minimal fisheye

720.49 --> 726.4590000000001
effect on it so if people who bring

722.889 --> 727.23
recommendations to me that would be

726.459 --> 732.189
awesome as well

727.23 --> 736.029
hmm yeah yeah what do you reckon I think

732.189 --> 737.98
it's a great idea a balloon launch look

736.029 --> 740.439
the thing about these balloon launches

737.98 --> 743.74
and there's many there have been many

740.439 --> 746.649
people now by now that if launched

743.74 --> 749.62
balloons must have been dozens and

746.649 --> 751.42
dozens I think and we don't even know

749.62 --> 753.37
about each one of them because kind of

751.42 --> 756.0999999999999
we had the segregation thing we don't

753.37 --> 758.35
know everyone else and there's there

756.1 --> 761.9200000000001
appears to be a lot more flattering out

758.35 --> 764.9200000000001
there that we never even hear of so that

761.92 --> 767.439
some my chance just bump into and then

764.92 --> 770.319
find out oh my god these there's like a

767.439 --> 771.91
hundred new people here so there have

770.319 --> 774.459
bound to be a lot of balloon launches

771.91 --> 776.079
and the advantage is that more the more

774.459 --> 779.38
and more people try that the more we

776.079 --> 782.17
learn from the mistakes and the

779.38 --> 784.54
accidents that happen and just for how

782.17 --> 787.87
to actually properly design such a

784.54 --> 789.579
project so the more people do it the

787.87 --> 794.009
easier and potentially cheaper it

789.579 --> 797.319
becomes and you don't you get better

794.009 --> 799.569
rate of success basically from from the

797.319 --> 804.399
investment so that's a good thing it's

799.569 --> 806.3499999999999
now pretty much been for years that Flat

804.399 --> 809.05
Earth has started up there's a lot to

806.35 --> 810.91
learn out there a lot of people that

809.05 --> 813.699
have launched balloons that I recommend

810.91 --> 815.699
you contact and learn at what they do

813.699 --> 820.8389999999999
hear them out there they'll be bound to

815.699 --> 822.6099999999999
to have some things to share yeah but

820.839 --> 826.36
I've been told to you Rick thank you a

822.61 --> 828.22
lens that's for me our best bet

826.36 --> 831.399
alone I have looked at a lot of videos a

828.22 --> 834.7900000000001
lot of them clearly see you know that

831.399 --> 836.23
they're not like a lot of the ones on on

834.79 --> 838.449
YouTube they just go up they're not

836.23 --> 840.1
trying to make observations on my Flat

838.449 --> 842.829
Earth or anything like that and describe

840.1 --> 845.1990000000001
up just to to try and reach altitude but

842.829 --> 845.63
they're clearly using fisheye lenses and

845.199 --> 849.2299999999999
when

845.63 --> 852.5
the actual gluings moving around in the

849.23 --> 854.029
payloads meeting around sometimes this

852.5 --> 856.37
curve from the fisheye and then

854.029 --> 859.579
sometimes and see how can that be good

856.37 --> 861.38
yeah yeah like this

859.579 --> 866.529
yeah we all know without kind of it that

861.38 --> 869.06
right it's the go programs typically

866.529 --> 871.579
yeah yeah so I don't want to use that or

869.06 --> 874.31
use a rectangular that's mm-hmm I don't

871.579 --> 877.569
just not sure what what what one would

874.31 --> 880.7589999999999
be the best oh yeah ask around

877.569 --> 884.199
yeah yeah it might even actually take a

880.759 --> 887.4490000000001
while to dig through everyone out there

884.199 --> 889.55
because there's a lot of people so yeah

887.449 --> 892.2199999999999
go go on an investigation

889.55 --> 893.0889999999999
talk to other address other

892.22 --> 895.73
flat-earthers

893.089 --> 898.3100000000001
email them dick through channels see

895.73 --> 902.4490000000001
who's tried it or knows somebody that

898.31 --> 904.459
tried it and yeah you know talk my

902.449 --> 907.7589999999999
advices talk to jarrandi tried it I

904.459 --> 909.6199999999999
think yeah at least once maybe maybe

907.759 --> 912.62
they did it a second time but I I know

909.62 --> 917.6
the first one failed at least or they

912.62 --> 921.589
couldn't find it back or something right

917.6 --> 924.5
so but these are but these are all

921.589 --> 927.9200000000001
issues that happen and so you know they

924.5 --> 930.91
can't happen and then you can account

927.92 --> 933.2299999999999
for it somehow they figure it out so I

930.91 --> 936.37
recommend trying to talk to Jaron maybe

933.23 --> 940.939
email him he's bound to be a busy guy

936.37 --> 943.67
and I don't know maybe talk to Karen be

940.939 --> 945.86
Karen be has a lot of contacts with

943.67 --> 947.99
Effie core and they've done balloon

945.86 --> 950.269
launches and you know there's a lot of

947.99 --> 957.11
people out there even that I know

950.269 --> 958.009
so try Jaron try Karen maybe Bob yeah Oh

957.11 --> 960.5500000000001
take a look

958.009 --> 964.12
just plain I was actually looking at

960.55 --> 967.2199999999999
40,000 feet say it's pretty impressive

964.12 --> 971.269
mm-hmm right but at least you want to do

967.22 --> 973.1890000000001
a GoFundMe that's a interesting but to

971.269 --> 975.639
be fair you'd have to know what it

973.189 --> 979.11
actually all cost first you just blindly

975.639 --> 981.029
exactly exactly I haven't said that

979.11 --> 982.92
that'll be something later on I'm going

981.029 --> 985.279
to have to do my research by that way

982.92 --> 988.11
and it costs the people don't wanted to

985.279 --> 990.51
fund it that's fine like I've been fun

988.11 --> 992.22
most of it myself but I just thought

990.51 --> 994.38
some people might want to get involved

992.22 --> 997.14
that they don't have to put a lot in but

994.38 --> 999.779
you know be interested in finding out

997.14 --> 1002.93
the truth or they getting involved in

999.779 --> 1005.029
health aids yeah it'll work

1002.93 --> 1010.6099999999999
I bet but you you gotta have a good plan

1005.029 --> 1012.5889999999999
so yeah oh do that I'll make sure right

1010.61 --> 1014.54
and it's gonna take some time probably

1012.589 --> 1020.4200000000001
unless you get really lucky with the

1014.54 --> 1023.06
first person you bump into yeah try to

1020.42 --> 1025.25
learn as much as possible because there

1023.06 --> 1027.02
is a lot to learn you know in the

1025.25 --> 1029.589
beginning people were just kind of

1027.02 --> 1032.54
trying out and hoping they would have

1029.589 --> 1035.12
foreseen it correctly and there isn't

1032.54 --> 1038.6599999999999
then still unexpected mistakes happen so

1035.12 --> 1043.01
there is a lot to learn to prevent all

1038.66 --> 1045.65
that from happening to you especially

1043.01 --> 1052.549
concerning design of the of the device

1045.65 --> 1054.679
of the contraption so yeah it's gonna

1052.549 --> 1056.48
work up at that altitude as well exactly

1054.679 --> 1059.0900000000001
I don't know what the rating is for this

1056.48 --> 1061.79
fishing ratings that that equipment as

1059.09 --> 1063.23
for the cool cool temperatures so you

1061.79 --> 1066.11
have to make sure you know you have all

1063.23 --> 1068.15
that sir in other words I can't just use

1066.11 --> 1071.6899999999998
a cheap cheap camera because it's

1068.15 --> 1074.9
probably bail up at that altitude okay

1071.69 --> 1079.8200000000002
I'll do you already have a GoFundMe page

1074.9 --> 1083.7800000000002
for an early Anthony guest no yeah but

1079.82 --> 1090.32
if they water yeah that's where it

1083.78 --> 1092.9289999999999
starts so I do it maybe maybe I don't

1090.32 --> 1094.61
know how long this takes but maybe if

1092.929 --> 1096.169
you know how to work that you could do

1094.61 --> 1097.9399999999998
it in and at the end of the show you

1096.169 --> 1102.2
could give me the link and I'll post it

1097.94 --> 1105.53
in chat yeah okay little bitterness cool

1102.2 --> 1108.0800000000002
cool man yeah well I'm gonna I wanted to

1105.53 --> 1109.85
come on and just be clear about that up

1108.08 --> 1112.6689999999999
with you man but I can't stay long love

1109.85 --> 1115.1899999999998
to chat with you but yeah good god

1112.669 --> 1119.179
kids gotta run ha right yeah that's

1115.19 --> 1123.769
always a good reason to go kill any man

1119.179 --> 1126.2
I don't know if I had them well I've got

1123.769 --> 1128.989
three kids in my hospital broken arm so

1126.2 --> 1134.929
ordinance any like seven months old big

1128.989 --> 1138.2
breaths Fetzer all right well go go be

1134.929 --> 1141.669
dad take it easy my friend

1138.2 --> 1146.48
all right you too thanks for joining

1141.669 --> 1152.3300000000002
okay all right that was cool

1146.48 --> 1155.269
so yeah warped mind it's got a plan to

1152.33 --> 1158.33
launch a balloon or he's got an idea he

1155.269 --> 1161.509
has to work out the plan and very

1158.33 --> 1163.4289999999999
curious how far this will go it might

1161.509 --> 1167.359
take a while I expect

1163.429 --> 1170.749
before he gets it all together because

1167.359 --> 1174.799
it it seems so basic but it's much more

1170.749 --> 1177.409
difficult really because of the weird

1174.799 --> 1180.019
yeah atmospherics and everything that's

1177.409 --> 1183.2
going on and the landing and trying to

1180.019 --> 1186.379
have the connection digitally all that

1183.2 --> 1188.269
so yeah it's it's a bit of a challenge

1186.379 --> 1190.9089999999999
but there's already been so many lessons

1188.269 --> 1197.98
learned and that's only a good thing

1190.909 --> 1197.98
because then you can anticipate alright

1200.01 --> 1208.24
so yeah I forgot to look who was in chat

1204.27 --> 1213.6299999999999
so let's go through that now it's been a

1208.24 --> 1222.28
lot of chat right so Steve was in early

1213.63 --> 1226.39
stone monkey 3d HM Voynich drunken

1222.28 --> 1232.33

1308.92 --> 1312.209
[Music]

1315.96 --> 1322.6200000000001
so let's see what's there to talk about

1324.42 --> 1331.99
yeah I am kind of open for other guests

1327.49 --> 1341.71
by the way maybe I should put out the

1331.99 --> 1351.99
link in the master be chat no could do

1341.71 --> 1351.99
that I see chocolate

1362.25 --> 1369.09

1375.43 --> 1383.3590000000002
[Music]

although they might all be already in in

1387.61 --> 1392.37
the free show at Nathan's or something

1395.01 --> 1412.09
okay weird chocolate says that they were

1403.21 --> 1414.3
spraying pentagrams in his sky right who

1412.09 --> 1414.3
knows

1416.82 --> 1421.6589999999999
yeah chocolate is not in chat is in the

1419.47 --> 1426.179
master be chat so I was just spying in

1421.659 --> 1426.179
on there maybe you'll join

1432.49 --> 1435.15
what is

1438.97 --> 1442.32
well that was weird

1444.56 --> 1451.07
huh I thought seriously I was looking

1447.95 --> 1456.5900000000001
back at the YouTube screen and it said

1451.07 --> 1457.52
going live in ten minutes uh like oh my

1456.59 --> 1460.28
god did

1457.52 --> 1463.06
that's impossible that nobody that it

1460.28 --> 1467.6
wasn't recording yet that would be crazy

1463.06 --> 1470.9299999999998
but it was a fluke somehow I refreshed

1467.6 --> 1477.49
the page and it was running after all

1470.93 --> 1477.49
that was week okay false alarm

1480.07 --> 1485.45
yeah bran damn that's a good one after

1483.62 --> 1489.07
yesterday are you getting right back on

1485.45 --> 1489.07
the debate horse sure

1489.34 --> 1493.6699999999998
sure I will

1490.97 --> 1497.44
I did get right back on the debate horse

1493.67 --> 1497.44
I just took it to another room so

1505.9 --> 1511.22
now flat enough

1508.04 --> 1514.1299999999999
Nathan show is not live yet he just

1511.22 --> 1516.29
threw out the link for a pre-show and

1514.13 --> 1518.15
that's not life the pre-show and the

1516.29 --> 1520.55
after shows are not life its own it is

1518.15 --> 1522.98
recorded and then it later premieres

1520.55 --> 1524.56
that's how Nathan does it should tell

1522.98 --> 1528.34
this by now he's been doing it for

1524.56 --> 1528.34
pretty entire year

1539.25 --> 1544.98
right brendham thanks for the support

1541.59 --> 1547.02
look at the same time I was kind of

1544.98 --> 1552.69
being a little bit more and sufferable

1547.02 --> 1557.58
than usual because again sometimes I

1552.69 --> 1559.8600000000001
just get in these I'm I get hyperactive

1557.58 --> 1563.1299999999999
in a way and my mind especially and then

1559.86 --> 1567.4799999999998
I get like all bouncy and really like

1563.13 --> 1569.94
derided sneak attack in fine a few

1567.48 --> 1571.23
seconds and just quickly utter a few

1569.94 --> 1574.169
words almost like a magic spell

1571.23 --> 1576.45
completely changing the perception of

1574.169 --> 1579.179
the discussion that's what I did it

1576.45 --> 1583.6200000000001
happens it's typically Arwen but it is

1579.179 --> 1586.1100000000001
also admittedly very disruptive to some

1583.62 --> 1588.27
people when they're not on the same

1586.11 --> 1590.039
energy level because if they are then it

1588.27 --> 1593.19
actually starts bubbling and then

1590.039 --> 1597.0
everybody gets the energy but they were

1593.19 --> 1601.2
off is like Nathan and Riley were in

1597.0 --> 1607.909
like a slow presentation mode thing so

1601.2 --> 1607.909
that didn't really work that day Oh Brin

1610.37 --> 1615.8999999999999
right oh by the way thank you a CEO

1613.14 --> 1618.7700000000002
Megawati for the $2 super chair donation

1615.9 --> 1618.77
much appreciated

1629.53 --> 1636.45
right okay flat enough I'll explain the

1633.37 --> 1640.06
link the Hangout link it goes out in the

1636.45 --> 1642.7
Skype chat the master be chat which is

1640.06 --> 1644.8
the original skype group on which the

1642.7 --> 1648.25
debates the Flat Earth debates was

1644.8 --> 1652.36
founded for the flat earther site pretty

1648.25 --> 1655.18
much and even polite ballers but they

1652.36 --> 1658.12
usually eventually end up just going

1655.18 --> 1661.0900000000001
away or getting removed because they go

1658.12 --> 1664.53
nuts as by the way happened with slick

1661.09 --> 1668.83
James Jones he went completely berserk

1664.53 --> 1671.59
started attacking everyone like

1668.83 --> 1673.36
literally no exception didn't make any

1671.59 --> 1680.1699999999998
sense he just literally went like a

1673.36 --> 1683.9799999999998
rabid dog and then Nathan made John into

1680.17 --> 1688.8700000000001
a moderator and John removed him so that

1683.98 --> 1690.97
was that but yeah that's the master be

1688.87 --> 1693.1599999999999
chat in Skype that's where he throws out

1690.97 --> 1696.22
the normal link and some other skype

1693.16 --> 1702.01
groups that are similar kind of more of

1696.22 --> 1706.66
the old Skype groups and afterwards he

1702.01 --> 1709.48
eventually updates his description box

1706.66 --> 1711.52
when he is life with the link he usually

1709.48 --> 1713.65
doesn't start out with that right away

1711.52 --> 1720.43
or sometimes he does I don't know it's

1713.65 --> 1722.76
up to what he wants so that's how he

1720.43 --> 1722.76
does it

1731.39 --> 1739.2990000000002
yeah I agree flat enough he is he seems

1736.22 --> 1743.95
to have a severe temperate disorder and

1739.299 --> 1749.12
he is like uncontrollable he's like an

1743.95 --> 1755.3600000000001
don't ya like an untamed dog just won't

1749.12 --> 1757.76
respond to normal social behavior and it

1755.36 --> 1764.4499999999998
just gets worse and worse and worse it's

1757.76 --> 1766.64
yeah like a rabid dog and in person that

1764.45 --> 1769.25
is potentially very dangerous because he

1766.64 --> 1772.5200000000002
if he behaves like this in conversations

1769.25 --> 1774.98
to that level then yeah you don't know

1772.52 --> 1778.82
how far he would go face to face he and

1774.98 --> 1781.82
he I think he's a pretty like strong

1778.82 --> 1785.36
dude he's like very trying to be alpha

1781.82 --> 1789.5
and new pimp and master manipulator all

1785.36 --> 1793.34
that so in person he may just when you

1789.5 --> 1796.04
actually like don't respect him as they

1793.34 --> 1801.049
say or just make some legitimate

1796.04 --> 1802.8799999999999
criticism and and don't ya don't

1801.049 --> 1805.16
approach him like he's the Alpha he

1802.88 --> 1807.0800000000002
might actually physically assault you I

1805.16 --> 1813.3200000000002
got that feeling from him pretty early

1807.08 --> 1817.21
on and yeah I'd stay away from him

1813.32 --> 1817.21
that's just my general advice

1818.22 --> 1823.74
[Music]

1825.91 --> 1831.8300000000002
all right so I don't I don't think he is

1829.43 --> 1835.3400000000001
banned on the debates though I don't

1831.83 --> 1837.1999999999998
know for sure he might be I they haven't

1835.34 --> 1840.6399999999999
told me if they have might be that ran

1837.2 --> 1843.5
tea or riot he blocked him silently or

1840.64 --> 1845.99
maybe in the open maybe de discuss I

1843.5 --> 1851.72
don't know this but I haven't seen sleek

1845.99 --> 1854.06
back pretty much since maybe he just

1851.72 --> 1856.06
figured out that he kind of hit rock

1854.06 --> 1858.83
bottom on a social level and just

1856.06 --> 1861.9199999999998
sneaked away just moved on to something

1858.83 --> 1866.32
else where his experience is less

1861.92 --> 1866.3200000000002
burdensome as it were

1874.21 --> 1876.8990000000001
yeah

1885.25 --> 1891.47
all right

1887.69 --> 1897.68
yep he said all that it's kind of a

1891.47 --> 1900.95
weirdo it's it's cut but but he is

1897.68 --> 1906.2
really a weirdo when he's calm he he

1900.95 --> 1908.78
does have like this unique energy of

1906.2 --> 1913.67
being and it's annoying

1908.78 --> 1916.94
but it is it I can't say it is

1913.67 --> 1919.01
completely utterly useless but

1916.94 --> 1921.74
unfortunately a lot of it is but it is

1919.01 --> 1925.85
kind of interesting in some way and when

1921.74 --> 1928.01
he's come he does sometimes have like he

1925.85 --> 1929.4199999999998
does see things that others never look

1928.01 --> 1932.17
because they're preoccupied but

1929.42 --> 1936.94
unfortunately he does doesn't reach

1932.17 --> 1940.76
anywhere that was his main problem and

1936.94 --> 1942.79
yeah he says he might be a master

1940.76 --> 1945.56
manipulator but I think he's grossly

1942.79 --> 1949.3999999999999
exaggerating though he does have the

1945.56 --> 1953.6
skill and especially the tone he's he's

1949.4 --> 1955.6100000000001
been trained himself this voice it's

1953.6 --> 1958.1899999999998
like speech training in some kind maybe

1955.61 --> 1961.1
did it maybe somebody else taught him or

1958.19 --> 1964.97
that autumn or whatever it just copied

1961.1 --> 1966.8899999999999
it but he does have that but my god he

1964.97 --> 1970.64
just doesn't have the understanding of

1966.89 --> 1973.3700000000001
people really he's a dumbass and he has

1970.64 --> 1979.5200000000002
poor so she has poor empathy skills he

1973.37 --> 1981.7399999999998
can't read other people obviously so if

1979.52 --> 1985.1
he's gonna be a master manipulator he

1981.74 --> 1989.21
will do it probably by force or pure

1985.1 --> 1993.77
dominance or sexual appeal somehow to

1989.21 --> 1997.07
women that must be rock-bottom dumb I

1993.77 --> 1999.3799999999999
can't say it any other way you must be

1997.07 --> 2003.9099999999999
freaking [ __ ] if you're going to be

1999.38 --> 2006.5200000000002
pimped by this guy because a master a

2003.91 --> 2011.64
real master manipulator is a freakin

2006.52 --> 2014.8
genius and they would never say even or

2011.64 --> 2017.14
look as soon as a master manipulators

2014.8 --> 2019.26
pretty much people get a hint that they

2017.14 --> 2021.45
are other than yeah

2019.26 --> 2023.82
just paranoid people then you got a

2021.45 --> 2027.0900000000001
problem as a master manipulator so it

2023.82 --> 2031.1699999999998
made no damn sense that he would say

2027.09 --> 2034.08
that and by the way I based this yeah

2031.17 --> 2036.66
this knowledge wisdom whatever pretty

2034.08 --> 2041.58
much on also on D&D in which there are

2036.66 --> 2043.77
even special age classes yeah right

2041.58 --> 2046.6499999999999
there's like a so many types of

2043.77 --> 2048.899
different mages it's insane in D&D and

2046.65 --> 2051.36
there is like a mind bender it's what

2048.899 --> 2055.3199999999997
it's called and I even make remade the

2051.36 --> 2058.61
class that class that that mage class in

2055.32 --> 2061.5
my in my book so I got a

2058.61 --> 2071.3700000000003
conceptualization of how a real master

2061.5 --> 2080.28
manipulator would be going around oh god

2071.37 --> 2083.669
yeah that Jim picture has you know what

2080.28 --> 2086.28
it's kind of funny though because doing

2083.669 --> 2090.12
that that Jim picture it just reminds me

2086.28 --> 2093.0600000000004
of back in the day when I was doing the

2090.12 --> 2096.0299999999997
Gothic and I still am on the side

2093.06 --> 2100.08
technically I have a web I am a profile

2096.03 --> 2104.82
on the vampire freaks calm gothic

2100.08 --> 2106.68
electro community and stuff blah blah

2104.82 --> 2108.1200000000003
it's going on for a long long time

2106.68 --> 2111.1499999999996
there's some interesting people there

2108.12 --> 2114.8399999999997
and very vain and very idiotic people as

2111.15 --> 2116.31
well but oh god now I lost my points

2114.84 --> 2121.56
that's terrible

2116.31 --> 2126.06
oh no I know it again right people like

2121.56 --> 2128.43
there's among those profiles you like

2126.06 --> 2130.7999999999997
just go around the F like tens of

2128.43 --> 2133.9199999999996
thousands maybe you the million people

2130.8 --> 2135.6600000000003
there you can just get like look flick

2133.92 --> 2137.7000000000003
through them through for all the

2135.66 --> 2139.3199999999997
profiles and pictures whatever they

2137.7 --> 2141.99
throw public and there's a lot there's

2139.32 --> 2144.69
like insane women there that have like

2141.99 --> 2147.9799999999996
tens of thousands of pictures of

2144.69 --> 2152.7200000000003
themself at all oh I'm sorry

2147.98 --> 2157.05
really but there's also like this guy

2152.72 --> 2159.2099999999996
like guys in their 20s that would just

2157.05 --> 2165.9
have like bare chest and in the mirror

2159.21 --> 2170.25
like oh and so and that's that behavior

2165.9 --> 2176.25
that's like what like kind of late

2170.25 --> 2179.0
puberty young twenties vain guys would

2176.25 --> 2182.73
do and that's what this guy like in his

2179.0 --> 2187.41
40s or 50s or something is doing it's so

2182.73 --> 2189.75
hilarious it's so juvenile I kept on

2187.41 --> 2191.94
saying he has the psychology like off a

2189.75 --> 2194.43
12 year old really that's that the

2191.94 --> 2197.76
energy level the level of complication

2194.43 --> 2202.2599999999998
that comes from him it doesn't reach

2197.76 --> 2205.32
it's very limited it's oh by the way

2202.26 --> 2209.0600000000004
again Thank You Theo Megawati for the to

2205.32 --> 2212.19
super chat to dollar super chat donation

2209.06 --> 2217.56
slick is unique learning experience for

2212.19 --> 2225.03
others nice nice so enough about slick

2217.56 --> 2227.04
ID again I try to say something positive

2225.03 --> 2229.4300000000003
about him I guess but it's just very

2227.04 --> 2229.43
tough

2231.85 --> 2241.0899999999997
I don't know I'm yeah he's not he's not

2235.99 --> 2244.66
a truly evil person like a no like a

2241.09 --> 2251.23
controller type a real psychopath or no

2244.66 --> 2253.87
he's just basic and it just tries to be

2251.23 --> 2256.45
dominant it's almost a self defense and

2253.87 --> 2262.81
a ruling mecha controlling mechanism at

2256.45 --> 2267.04
the same time and like he could do evil

2262.81 --> 2269.29
but he probably wouldn't want to it's

2267.04 --> 2271.75
just that he probably used loses his

2269.29 --> 2273.73
control very easily so it just gets

2271.75 --> 2277.51
himself into trouble and then he just

2273.73 --> 2282.61
like has this Man Thing like oh okay I'm

2277.51 --> 2285.19
just gonna like not pretend like it like

2282.61 --> 2287.2000000000003
it was on purpose and that I'm like I

2285.19 --> 2290.35
did it so I did it and I don't have

2287.2 --> 2292.6899999999996
regrets that type of response but I

2290.35 --> 2295.5899999999997
don't see him like a really like a real

2292.69 --> 2299.05
plan killer or anything absolutely not

2295.59 --> 2305.56
so it's just a guy's out of control and

2299.05 --> 2310.84
weird this oh gods Brandon well maybe he

2305.56 --> 2315.16
is doing look he's a gym guy maybe he is

2310.84 --> 2318.2400000000002
like doing steroids or anything I didn't

2315.16 --> 2322.75
know he could I don't know if he does

2318.24 --> 2326.83
but to be fair there are relatively many

2322.75 --> 2329.08
people out there that do this so I

2326.83 --> 2331.0
wouldn't be surprised if he did it would

2329.08 --> 2333.25
definitely correspond with his lack of

2331.0 --> 2336.25
control in anger management and

2333.25 --> 2340.03
everything very touch is touchiness

2336.25 --> 2344.91
about his person so that would make some

2340.03 --> 2347.9100000000003
kind of senses thanks for sharing that

2344.91 --> 2347.91
enough

2349.22 --> 2356.47
[Music]

2351.48 --> 2359.83
yeah God you guys keep on making me talk

2356.47 --> 2361.74
about this terrible right so yeah he

2359.83 --> 2365.65
does pose as some kind of teacher

2361.74 --> 2373.66
definitely but then again so do I I

2365.65 --> 2375.9300000000003
guess just my age my age range is just a

2373.66 --> 2385.2
little different because I actually

2375.93 --> 2385.2
still I my age reach is pretty much

2385.26 --> 2392.6200000000003
middle to late teenage up to people in

2391.09 --> 2395.56
their forties 50s

2392.62 --> 2397.45
although there will be many people that

2395.56 --> 2401.38
are older that would look at me and say

2397.45 --> 2404.62
okay there's like there they're probably

2401.38 --> 2408.07
much more developed or integrated into

2404.62 --> 2412.96
society and they may think okay yeah

2408.07 --> 2414.63
this guy is kind of slow in a societal

2412.96 --> 2420.13
development and they would be correct

2414.63 --> 2422.6800000000003
but yeah they might still see like

2420.13 --> 2425.1400000000003
compare themselves to me and see that I

2422.68 --> 2429.16
did kind of did an alternative

2425.14 --> 2432.43
investment into my thinking skills and

2429.16 --> 2435.6099999999997
my sensing skills by studying me over my

2432.43 --> 2439.45
videos that is all real I don't make up

2435.61 --> 2444.4
[ __ ] unless I specifically say that it

2439.45 --> 2446.4399999999996
is that like the D&D world or even the

2444.4 --> 2452.02
dark world which is not literally made

2446.44 --> 2454.78
up but it much of it was probably a like

2452.02 --> 2457.24
a hallucination of my inner imagination

2454.78 --> 2460.57
that will be very mysterious it's not

2457.24 --> 2465.18
just made up but it's not like a lie I

2460.57 --> 2465.1800000000003
don't do that I just don't I

2468.79 --> 2475.21
yeah anyway I hope you guys trust me on

2473.39 --> 2482.81
that

2475.21 --> 2490.87
figure it out feel it yeah but many

2482.81 --> 2494.9
people will think that I don't know I

2490.87 --> 2499.04
think mostly it's like I'm trying to

2494.9 --> 2501.02
reach back in a weird way and and that

2499.04 --> 2503.09
is kind of a surreal process at this

2501.02 --> 2509.3
okay you have to take this into County

2503.09 --> 2514.3900000000003
the transcript the time element in a way

2509.3 --> 2520.8500000000004
I am trying to teach an age group that

2514.39 --> 2525.62
was me when I when I had my vision

2520.85 --> 2528.68
experience and in that sense somehow I

2525.62 --> 2533.42
did experience much of what I'm doing

2528.68 --> 2537.41
now I kind of learned before I could I

2533.42 --> 2541.7000000000003
learned it but it didn't stick just the

2537.41 --> 2545.0
memory of it stuck but it did the

2541.7 --> 2549.2
essence didn't rub off but couldn't fit

2545.0 --> 2550.97
because it didn't happen yet and I don't

2549.2 --> 2554.5899999999997
know how that works but I experienced it

2550.97 --> 2558.3199999999997
very er and again kind of trying to

2554.59 --> 2561.32
teach myself in the past and I don't

2558.32 --> 2563.6000000000004
know that's what it how it feels like to

2561.32 --> 2567.67
me but I hope also to be directing just

2563.6 --> 2570.38
a lot of other people out there and

2567.67 --> 2573.6800000000003
because I think that a lot of teenagers

2570.38 --> 2577.34
are dealing with very complicated inner

2573.68 --> 2585.0099999999998
processes some of them may be like stuck

2577.34 --> 2587.36
into typical loops of lust or allure or

2585.01 --> 2590.6000000000004
addictions kind of things that's very

2587.36 --> 2594.77
common teenagers that they get stuck at

2590.6 --> 2596.5699999999997
loops but they're also trying a lot of

2594.77 --> 2600.2599999999998
new things they're really reaching out

2596.57 --> 2600.5
to the super fast world compared to what

2600.26 --> 2603.7900000000004
the

2600.5 --> 2608.39
world is when you're a child and and

2603.79 --> 2611.9
there are so many dangers there and like

2608.39 --> 2614.24
things that could be good but it's like

2611.9 --> 2616.84
too complex as a teenager to really size

2614.24 --> 2619.04
it up properly so you really want more

2616.84 --> 2620.69
experience more teachers more real

2619.04 --> 2625.52
teachers out there they'll teach you

2620.69 --> 2629.86
about things that aren't really so

2625.52 --> 2632.75
openly talked about by most people and

2629.86 --> 2639.67
that's where I hope I can fill in a

2632.75 --> 2647.41
blank anyway so yeah medical talk

2639.67 --> 2651.46
spiritual talk self-development

2647.41 --> 2653.8999999999996
sensories just personal sensory and

2651.46 --> 2658.81
learning how to deal with that and how

2653.9 --> 2661.1600000000003
to get personal problem psychological

2658.81 --> 2663.59
processes under control that kind of

2661.16 --> 2666.44
thing is where a lot of my talents lie

2663.59 --> 2669.98
and I hope too that it rubs off that

2666.44 --> 2672.56
people can hear me out on it try to see

2669.98 --> 2674.96
if that matches sort of the situation

2672.56 --> 2677.6
that I could that they could sort of try

2674.96 --> 2681.88
out the same thing and I maybe it'll

2677.6 --> 2688.43
work and even people like Reese and

2681.88 --> 2691.13
peanuts Clark they they did this and I

2688.43 --> 2695.2999999999997
wasn't even a hundred percent sure which

2691.13 --> 2697.79
piece of advice it was but because I'm

2695.3 --> 2699.38
always just trying to do this with

2697.79 --> 2700.7599999999998
everything it's just routine just

2699.38 --> 2702.62
putting in one piece another piece

2700.76 --> 2704.03
another piece I didn't even know

2702.62 --> 2705.98
specifically which one they take but

2704.03 --> 2709.61
apparently one of the few of the things

2705.98 --> 2711.59
I was saying inspired them greatly in

2709.61 --> 2716.9
order to really fix some things and that

2711.59 --> 2722.03
just is I actually made some kind of

2716.9 --> 2724.34
difference that's really good for it's

2722.03 --> 2726.2900000000004
really a reassurance that it actually

2724.34 --> 2729.1400000000003
means something that is actually doing

2726.29 --> 2733.7
something good so

2729.14 --> 2744.5899999999997
right enough about that I have 50 more

2733.7 --> 2748.1499999999996
minutes to go right who old coin yeah I

2744.59 --> 2752.36
maybe get I'm probably getting into the

2748.15 --> 2755.7200000000003
Bitcoin thingy as well and sooner or

2752.36 --> 2759.92
later there will probably be a Bitcoin

2755.72 --> 2762.77
link donation thingy as well I saw some

2759.92 --> 2766.79
of that a lot of it with Nathan but I

2762.77 --> 2769.25
have one and already I need one because

2766.79 --> 2775.91
it's become indispensable in the

2769.25 --> 2778.67
indispensable part of the GTI system

2775.91 --> 2782.75
they integrated it because the banks

2778.67 --> 2784.94
were just too much hassle and made it

2782.75 --> 2787.67
that's not the only place where we see

2784.94 --> 2791.03
that right now suddenly there's in

2787.67 --> 2793.94
question well if you follow Infowars or

2791.03 --> 2797.2400000000002
other alternatives like suppose you'd

2793.94 --> 2799.4
write three sites there all day world

2797.24 --> 2800.87
set sir they are being censored more and

2799.4 --> 2804.23
more through facebook twitter and yeah

2800.87 --> 2806.18
blah blah everywhere and now the banks

2804.23 --> 2809.72
are like trying to screw them over you

2806.18 --> 2813.9199999999996
first PayPal even with Owen Benjamin but

2809.72 --> 2818.1699999999996
now even things like Visa Card are like

2813.92 --> 2821.9300000000003
on the target list and yeah that's a big

2818.17 --> 2823.85
problem if they get like then it's truly

2821.93 --> 2826.1
screwed the totally screw up

2823.85 --> 2828.44
international trade severely

2826.1 --> 2833.48
it's very dangerous if that's allowed

2828.44 --> 2835.9700000000003
and well we were trying through credit

2833.48 --> 2838.79
like GTI was trying through like credit

2835.97 --> 2842.8399999999997
card bank systems or a debit card it

2838.79 --> 2847.1
would be no no credit but they were just

2842.84 --> 2848.33
getting like they were so the bank's all

2847.1 --> 2850.97
of them so far have been so

2848.33 --> 2853.88
uncooperative and always trying to like

2850.97 --> 2856.2799999999997
bully them because they know it's like

2853.88 --> 2860.27
serious banker competition and they

2856.28 --> 2862.42
don't like it so they're now trying it

2860.27 --> 2866.65
through

2862.42 --> 2869.09
their own type of cryptocurrency and

2866.65 --> 2872.51
using that as a foundation it's become

2869.09 --> 2875.42
more viable to use so I'm getting into

2872.51 --> 2878.9
that I have to for well for my life's

2875.42 --> 2882.05
maintenance for my future plan and there

2878.9 --> 2884.6
will also be the link for that you can

2882.05 --> 2887.03
eventually donate to that in the

2884.6 --> 2889.3399999999997
description box not right now it's not

2887.03 --> 2891.8900000000003
all figured out yet still in the startup

2889.34 --> 2895.9
phase and GTI isn't even truly tied into

2891.89 --> 2904.66
it yet they're still reconfiguring the

2895.9 --> 2910.13
the program and everything so alright

2904.66 --> 2914.3799999999997
cerium right yeah there are so many

2910.13 --> 2917.2400000000002
cryptocurrencies now I know aetherium

2914.38 --> 2919.19
I've already been like kind of keeping

2917.24 --> 2921.02
track of some of the sites like or

2919.19 --> 2924.37
having an account not really doing

2921.02 --> 2929.86
anything with it but like getting there

2924.37 --> 2929.8599999999997
to see like yeah that's gonna happen

2932.3 --> 2941.9300000000003
right but yet just as a minor detail

2938.57 --> 2947.81
the GTI will not be mining

2941.93 --> 2954.02
cryptocurrency will just be basically

2947.81 --> 2957.5299999999997
trading or have being yeah it will be

2954.02 --> 2960.32
trading cryptocurrency rather that's

2957.53 --> 2962.2400000000002
deal no no that's technically incorrect

2960.32 --> 2964.34
you know what I'll leave it to that

2962.24 --> 2967.6899999999996
because you're not even supposed to talk

2964.34 --> 2975.2000000000003
about it really the details too much

2967.69 --> 2976.82
over the internet anyway but yeah

2975.2 --> 2979.1299999999997
cryptocurrency is getting involved

2976.82 --> 2983.3900000000003
because the regular banking systems were

2979.13 --> 2984.1400000000003
just not cooperating so yeah take it for

2983.39 --> 2988.25
what it's worth

2984.14 --> 2992.77
banks are getting really really dickish

2988.25 --> 2992.77
what is going on

2999.89 --> 3002.7599999999998
okay

3009.059 --> 3019.1400000000003
oh alright I see a little detail mistake

3015.39 --> 3023.959
there hold on yeah the the upvotes the

3019.14 --> 3026.959
one is missing because its hold on

3023.959 --> 3026.959
hilarious

3030.529 --> 3035.15
alright okay yeah this little chunk hold

3034.319 --> 3038.419
on

3035.15 --> 3038.419
details details

3044.03 --> 3058.52
right ah thanks for them 11 of us it's

3053.39 --> 3064.2799999999997
not too bad today um let's see what else

3058.52 --> 3070.67
can I talk about krypter krypter krypter

3064.28 --> 3072.6200000000003
yeah well the funny thing about crypto

3070.67 --> 3075.05
if you really think about it besides the

3072.62 --> 3077.68
technical element to it and the process

3075.05 --> 3082.28
of how it is a dog how it is mind

3077.68 --> 3086.5699999999997
besides that it is basically almost like

3082.28 --> 3090.05
a fiat currency but it's decentralized

3086.57 --> 3095.8300000000004
and that is what makes it really

3090.05 --> 3099.92
interesting it's like a decentralized

3095.83 --> 3102.5
fiat currency the white is not filled

3099.92 --> 3105.71
yet it's not fiat because that's what

3102.5 --> 3108.73
fiat means it's literally brought into

3105.71 --> 3111.68
being by decision making raffia and

3108.73 --> 3114.8
that's not it how it works is there yeah

3111.68 --> 3118.19
but it's basically in non backed

3114.8 --> 3122.26
currency but decentralized decentralized

3118.19 --> 3127.82
non backed currency not backed by gold

3122.26 --> 3133.73
like the original way of banking it's

3127.82 --> 3135.4100000000003
fascinating and viable as long as you

3133.73 --> 3140.3
don't really go with Bitcoin because

3135.41 --> 3145.0699999999997
bitcoin is just energy consuming yeah

3140.3 --> 3150.46
it's terrible it's not good not good for

3145.07 --> 3150.46
the energy consumption in general yeah

3163.75 --> 3171.71
right well AGM the thing is I'd love to

3168.799 --> 3174.95
buy gold and silver I actually did

3171.71 --> 3177.71
originally buy gold and silver had a lot

3174.95 --> 3182.68
of it but then I screwed up my life

3177.71 --> 3186.309
roughly or yeah my ex happened I

3182.68 --> 3189.9199999999996
complained it on there but I was just i

3186.309 --> 3192.38
wasn't financially stable enough and so

3189.92 --> 3194.2400000000002
I pretty much lost it all again but I'd

3192.38 --> 3196.88
love to get into that again as soon as I

3194.24 --> 3199.7599999999998
get some kind of surplus but before I

3196.88 --> 3204.9100000000003
get there even in investing in some kind

3199.76 --> 3209.6600000000003
of backup I have just a lot to invest to

3204.91 --> 3211.7799999999997
for just living so there are so many

3209.66 --> 3213.25
upgrades I need to be making in my life

3211.78 --> 3216.9100000000003
[Music]

3213.25 --> 3216.91
it's gonna take a while

3223.55 --> 3229.15
and save my mind you know that's stupid

3244.55 --> 3251.9300000000003
huh yeah over Marco I've heard that

3247.97 --> 3256.25
block chain based streaming it is funny

3251.93 --> 3260.45
and I have also touched upon it but

3256.25 --> 3262.67
again our win yeah I'm kind of Slough

3260.45 --> 3266.0299999999997
when it comes to practical things so

3262.67 --> 3270.6800000000003
ideas always I always look at things but

3266.03 --> 3275.0
actually doing it that's something else

3270.68 --> 3277.87
so I'm like looking at it and just I'm

3275.0 --> 3281.36
like the cat in the tree just staring

3277.87 --> 3284.96
staring down like what is that very

3281.36 --> 3288.02
careful at initiating things just like I

3284.96 --> 3290.42
did with Facebook and I'm very happy

3288.02 --> 3294.74
that I did that very very happy because

3290.42 --> 3299.03
it all came out exactly exactly what I

3294.74 --> 3301.4599999999996
thought it's terrible probably even

3299.03 --> 3303.0800000000004
worse than I imagined but I had a pretty

3301.46 --> 3305.59
good gist of what it was going to turn

3303.08 --> 3305.59
out to be

3312.16 --> 3318.58
[Music]

3313.48 --> 3318.58
yeah where is that

3348.95 --> 3357.33
it keeps unscrewing up sorry the visuals

3354.15 --> 3360.0
like the stupid vote counter like I'm

3357.33 --> 3361.23
gonna throw it away after this it's more

3360.0 --> 3363.66
hassle than it's worth

3361.23 --> 3365.58
it's just troll baiting anyway I don't

3363.66 --> 3368.6099999999997
know it's just like oh you can do that

3365.58 --> 3370.62
it's a technical fooling around with oh

3368.61 --> 3372.6600000000003
yes and I find this very amusing it

3370.62 --> 3374.94
reminds me a little bit about fooling

3372.66 --> 3377.31
around with Commodore 64 things it's

3374.94 --> 3380.1
very basic simple systematic and I get

3377.31 --> 3385.17
that get systematic things once I

3380.1 --> 3387.68
initiate in engaging which is very high

3385.17 --> 3391.52
threshold for me engaging in new things

3387.68 --> 3397.08
once I get there I will assimilate it

3391.52 --> 3399.99
absolutely sour and a half I really get

3397.08 --> 3402.39
OBS now only problems that I still have

3399.99 --> 3404.5499999999997
is sound control it's not too good I

3402.39 --> 3407.31
don't understand decide the mixer part

3404.55 --> 3410.4
two well enough to kind of get a good

3407.31 --> 3415.08
sound out of it but still haven't worked

3410.4 --> 3421.38
out the audio banana system at all at

3415.08 --> 3423.5699999999997
all who knows if that'll ever happen but

3421.38 --> 3428.6400000000003
at least my audio seems to be kind of

3423.57 --> 3437.36
okay so alright I'm gonna throw away the

3428.64 --> 3437.3599999999997
stupid votes done with this goodbye poof

3438.099 --> 3441.88
and it's gone

3449.81 --> 3459.35
gary gear and it's back to old so uh

3456.4 --> 3462.59
yeah I'm think I'm gonna run out to show

3459.35 --> 3468.2
now although we have three more minutes

3462.59 --> 3473.98
now I'll do it okay so thanks everyone

3468.2 --> 3473.98
for all you people are talking coins

3475.27 --> 3484.64
that's interesting stuff I would not

3482.24 --> 3487.1
object if you guys at some point would

3484.64 --> 3490.79
just start to talk about it on my panel

3487.1 --> 3493.1
maybe in the weekends maybe next we can

3490.79 --> 3495.59
try that that would be interesting I

3493.1 --> 3499.25
would like to talk about crypto

3495.59 --> 3503.29
currencies there is a lot to say about

3499.25 --> 3505.76
it and it's kind of a new thing and

3503.29 --> 3508.96
especially the older generations are

3505.76 --> 3512.15
like oh girls didn't computer and thingy

3508.96 --> 3514.82
weird I thought it was really weird I

3512.15 --> 3517.01
still kind of do I don't fully get the

3514.82 --> 3521.21
feel for it yet but I'm I'm getting

3517.01 --> 3526.9
there slowly I'm getting there it only

3521.21 --> 3529.58
took me like a decade you know anyway

3526.9 --> 3531.05
maybe it would be interesting to deal

3529.58 --> 3532.61
with that subject but I'm not gonna do

3531.05 --> 3535.3700000000003
it on my own I'm definitely not the

3532.61 --> 3536.9
expert and I know there's some people

3535.37 --> 3541.0099999999998
among you that do know a lot more about

3536.9 --> 3543.5
this but anyway for now I am gonna run

3541.01 --> 3545.8
out the show though thanks everyone for

3543.5 --> 3545.8
