82.97 --> 92.119
clouds but also there are some

87.47 --> 94.94
chemtrails going on unfortunately so

92.119 --> 97.15
yeah the super clear skies have stopped

94.94 --> 97.14999999999999
now

102.38 --> 114.11
I've been having some pretty heavy

105.549 --> 118.03
experiences yeah Halloween

114.11 --> 130.94
yeah well demo better believe it

118.03 --> 141.23
[ __ ] uh yeah the ghosts are restless and

130.94 --> 143.93
I can feel it and it's like the dark

141.23 --> 147.67
world illusions are like making a move

143.93 --> 149.59
to convince themselves onto me again

147.67 --> 153.35
that's what that's what I've been

149.59 --> 155.9
experiencing this morning it's not very

153.35 --> 159.01
pleasant but an interesting part was

155.9 --> 165.049
yeah yesterday I tried something new

159.01 --> 170.39
with my lunches I tried very I don't

165.049 --> 172.88
know familiar type of setup that even

170.39 --> 175.76
kind of resembled like the lunch I had

172.88 --> 180.47
during the Amsterdam conference but it's

175.76 --> 186.79
basically just a spell based small bread

180.47 --> 193.87
and then with Sal rough raw salad on it

186.79 --> 193.87
sun-dried tomatoes in oil and pineapple

195.489 --> 203.93
things call them you know from

199.64 --> 205.54899999999998
pineapples the seeds and yeah that I

203.93 --> 208.88
don't know those seeds they're very

205.549 --> 212.66
expensive but yeah you don't need them a

208.88 --> 217.22
lot of them and they really hit some

212.66 --> 219.89
kind of void spot for me and I've so

217.22 --> 225.35
I've been eating like three of those

219.89 --> 230.04899999999998
yesterday hmm and because of that yeah

225.35 --> 230.049
last night I went to bed pretty early

230.8 --> 238.69
and man like I was already halfway

235.21 --> 243.93
dreaming as I was going to bed it was

238.69 --> 243.93
like that and I've had pretty heavy

246.99 --> 253.45000000000002
experiences it it it was kind of

250.69 --> 257.56
fascinating because it seems to that I

253.45 --> 261.4
experienced some kind of construct based

257.56 --> 263.92
on the characters yeah really on the

261.4 --> 267.96
characters of my dark world experiences

263.92 --> 276.19
they're archetypes what they did like

267.96 --> 278.83
judgment and trickster and they had very

276.19 --> 281.23
specific type of faces correlate and it

278.83 --> 289.51
seemed to have the dream had taken on

281.23 --> 291.88
those faces to impress and well the

289.51 --> 294.37
weird thing was there was just a lot of

291.88 --> 297.1
bickering going on the funny thing was

294.37 --> 302.29
is that to go into details as to what

297.1 --> 304.96000000000004
said what and how I live lend meaning

302.29 --> 307.72
from that I can't I can't even begin to

304.96 --> 309.64
explain that so complicated this is just

307.72 --> 313.06
a multi-dimensional factor too it's

309.64 --> 315.4
really lent from my dark world from that

313.06 --> 321.49
experience it seems that's what it

315.4 --> 324.03
seemed like but the funny thing was is

321.49 --> 329.7
that the overall group and everything

324.03 --> 334.05999999999995
that there seemed to be if like a

329.7 --> 336.88
fundamental realization almost a

334.06 --> 342.01
consciousness like about the uncertainty

336.88 --> 344.46
of well remotely they'd never addressed

342.01 --> 346.75
it of their existence as it were about

344.46 --> 350.38
uncertainties over certain things that

346.75 --> 351.7
are happening it yeah anyway that was

350.38 --> 354.19
heavy

351.7 --> 356.94
oh yeah and of course yesterday all

354.19 --> 363.71999999999997
kinds of crazy things happened Infowars

356.94 --> 363.71999999999997
indeed Infowars put out a full-blown

363.86 --> 372.95
flat earth refined data it wasn't old

368.29 --> 378.8
[ __ ] no it was updated to what is going

372.95 --> 383.63
on now it was very very well refined and

378.8 --> 387.98
researched and careful and it was a good

383.63 --> 390.89
video wasn't flawless but it was yeah

387.98 --> 392.63
never seen anything from Infowars like

390.89 --> 394.64
that they've been they've entertained

392.63 --> 397.1
debates they've allowed talking about it

394.64 --> 402.62
in all kinds of ways but this time it

397.1 --> 405.31
was really like yeah they have good like

402.62 --> 409.85
they didn't even want to hand us the

405.31 --> 412.82
wind they just gave recognition as to

409.85 --> 415.46000000000004
the situation as to our the questions

412.82 --> 417.32
what we figured out that there's been

415.46 --> 419.68
fooling around going on that there

417.32 --> 423.40999999999997
secrets being kept very much emphasizing

419.68 --> 429.14
Antarctica and even bringing in new

423.41 --> 432.23
Schwabe land just like bang putting that

429.14 --> 435.86
over the Admiral but it was it was

432.23 --> 439.13
massive really and then and after that

435.86 --> 443.06
you had the show itself at least the

439.13 --> 444.98
Alex Jones part of the show also

443.06 --> 447.1
yeah they addressed it and also talked

444.98 --> 451.1
about vaccines and all kinds of things

447.1 --> 453.95000000000005
but it was addressed Mike Adams I heard

451.1 --> 460.31
him talk about it extensively pretty

453.95 --> 465.2
honestly but he did it was so funny he

460.31 --> 469.07
would in very careful he it was probably

465.2 --> 474.21999999999997
one of the best baller defenses I've

469.07 --> 481.43
ever seen anyone present it was like

474.22 --> 484.88000000000005
advanced cleaner rumpus level arguments

481.43 --> 490.34000000000003
it was it was embarrassing in a way but

484.88 --> 492.56
it yeah he really did his best but yeah

490.34 --> 495.38
constantly delving into presuppositions

492.56 --> 497.54
of course all that and even going as far

495.38 --> 500.51
as to not indirectly

497.54 --> 503.78000000000003
sticks in the ground orientation proves

500.51 --> 507.14
the glove that it it really came down to

503.78 --> 510.91999999999996
basics but in what it was better

507.14 --> 514.55
presented more careful anyway yeah that

510.92 --> 516.86
happened so that don't mistake this as

514.55 --> 523.04
some kind of like oh yeah that means

516.86 --> 527.0
we're now gonna submit to defeat that's

523.04 --> 530.87
not that that's not what this is I'm

527.0 --> 535.81
pretty convinced of that but it is a

530.87 --> 535.8100000000001
very honorable move you could say oh

539.68 --> 548.6899999999999

542.11 --> 553.61
no Brenda you wanna okay alright well

[Music]

712.91 --> 722.63
mmm yes now in 8012 by the way and that

719.0 --> 725.32
thing you said concerning Nathan it's

722.63 --> 725.32
ridiculous

731.23 --> 740.77
although I probably think that both

734.39 --> 744.98
money and fame are also a driving force

740.77 --> 751.28
social wise for him and he's been kind

744.98 --> 754.75
of honest about it you know and I don't

751.28 --> 754.75
think he over reaches

756.32 --> 760.99
[Music]

758.26 --> 764.52
right yeah now I haven't sent you an

760.99 --> 764.52
invite yet Brandon

774.51 --> 777.26
hmm

779.54 --> 782.5899999999999
oh man

798.91 --> 804.5799999999999
oh that's interesting Dave Johnson

802.14 --> 806.65
would you entertain the theory of a

804.58 --> 812.35
globe earth but all continents being

806.65 --> 815.1999999999999
seen from a little right

812.35 --> 819.4
you mean that the Jupiter Earth theory

815.2 --> 822.1600000000001
funnily enough to the Jupiter earth as I

819.4 --> 825.64
call it that the globe thousand times

822.16 --> 832.2099999999999
larger was actually mentioned in the

825.64 --> 839.9399999999999
info wars video that was special so if

832.21 --> 846.09
you mean that no if the specific

839.94 --> 849.1300000000001
location of our realm is on such a globe

846.09 --> 853.21
then it would yeah it would definitely

849.13 --> 857.08
be a disk because that doesn't make any

853.21 --> 860.02
sense for yeah the rectangular layout

857.08 --> 863.2
because that only works with that

860.02 --> 865.78
specific loop factor so that means that

863.2 --> 868.3000000000001
technically the realm would not be

865.78 --> 873.2099999999999
surrounded from all sides in a literal

868.3 --> 873.2099999999999
sense by more realm

881.98 --> 886.12
anyway yeah I guess we'll see where this

885.2 --> 889.24
goes

886.12 --> 895.88
yeah Brenda I see you tried to call me

889.24 --> 897.47
try to calm down for a bit and yeah I'll

895.88 --> 899.72
get you on but that's not a guarantee

897.47 --> 905.99
that if you're gonna get out of control

899.72 --> 909.58
or something that I'm not just gonna

905.99 --> 926.3
drop the call anyway I'll call you up

909.58 --> 928.85
let's see well oh okay you hear me good

926.3 --> 931.31
morning good morning can you hear me

928.85 --> 934.46
yes yes yes keep I'm talking I'm trying

931.31 --> 939.9799999999999
to regulate the volume keep talking

934.46 --> 942.23
please okay so hi yeah what are you

939.98 --> 943.52
talking about this morning everything

942.23 --> 946.97
and nothing

943.52 --> 950.15
the Alex Jones video was a definite

946.97 --> 952.37
subject that came to mind and yeah

950.15 --> 956.51
Halloween I've had some weird personal

952.37 --> 958.64
experiences so yeah that's it yeah you

956.51 --> 964.4
came in pretty early I'm just running

958.64 --> 968.36
for 30 minutes now okay so so Arwen it's

964.4 --> 970.49
not my intention for you to get really

968.36 --> 973.4300000000001
upset but we have very different views

970.49 --> 976.91
of the world and it's not that I want to

973.43 --> 981.52
get you get you upset I mean I don't you

976.91 --> 988.9399999999999
for being so careful with my feelings

981.52 --> 991.84
well you really think that's necessarily

988.94 --> 995.24
it is why why why

991.84 --> 998.26
what does Mary upset

995.24 --> 1001.03
what leads you to make that suggestion

998.26 --> 1006.64
why would I because you get very upset

1001.03 --> 1008.1999999999999
what when people disagree with you no no

1006.64 --> 1012.8
I don't

1008.2 --> 1016.5500000000001
okay no I get up so people are people

1012.8 --> 1019.49
misbehave and lie to my face that kind

1016.55 --> 1021.4699999999999
of it okay but lying to my face or just

1019.49 --> 1024.49
trying to trick me that's not the same

1021.47 --> 1026.99
thing as disagreeing about some

1024.49 --> 1028.7
intellectual thing okay that's not the

1026.99 --> 1030.83
same thing that doesn't piss me off

1028.7 --> 1034.97
people disagree all the time about

1030.83 --> 1037.1899999999998
details please so that's no reason to

1034.97 --> 1039.65
get pissed off it's about how you're

1037.19 --> 1041.78
gonna conduct yourself that will get me

1039.65 --> 1045.7900000000002
pissed off if you're gonna go over the

1041.78 --> 1048.5
edge so anything else

1045.79 --> 1050.6299999999999
so it's problem so it's probably best

1048.5 --> 1052.46
not to discuss Flat Earth then um how

1050.63 --> 1054.8000000000002
about why not you said something about

1052.46 --> 1056.93
having why not do you think it's

1054.8 --> 1059.72
Halloween why do you think you can't

1056.93 --> 1062.03
keep your behavior under control because

1059.72 --> 1064.43
that is the the parameter that I just

1062.03 --> 1067.07
gave out that would unleash some bad

1064.43 --> 1070.52
behavior in me how does that relate to

1067.07 --> 1072.1399999999999
just talking about Flat Earth is that a

1070.52 --> 1074.03
guarantee for you that you're gonna

1072.14 --> 1077.15
unleash bad behavior is that what you're

1074.03 --> 1079.8799999999999
suggesting because that would be

1077.15 --> 1083.0600000000002
required for me to become agitated and

1079.88 --> 1085.8500000000001
everything not talking about fly we

1083.06 --> 1087.71
would disagree yeah but that doesn't get

1085.85 --> 1091.9099999999999
me agitated yeah we would why are you

1087.71 --> 1092.39
sizing me up so wrong okay okay I don't

1091.91 --> 1095.42
get it

1092.39 --> 1097.94
well let's let's go past this yeah let's

1095.42 --> 1100.97
go past this too since it is Halloween

1097.94 --> 1102.56
since it is Halloween and you mentioned

1100.97 --> 1105.3500000000001
that you have odd experiences on

1102.56 --> 1113.8
Halloween what kind of odd experiences

1105.35 --> 1116.369
have you had very strong dreams oh okay

1113.8 --> 1120.249
yeah

1116.369 --> 1123.4599999999998
like you have dreams sometimes you have

1120.249 --> 1124.45
even vision or dark world experiences is

1123.46 --> 1128.5900000000001
it pretty incredible

1124.45 --> 1133.419
there seem to be just a dream with a lot

1128.59 --> 1135.519
of fuel poured into it so it was almost

1133.419 --> 1137.739
like a dark world experiences but it

1135.519 --> 1142.57
wasn't really a dark world experience it

1137.739 --> 1146.23
I wasn't locked into it I it was still a

1142.57 --> 1148.509
dream experience but there was just a

1146.23 --> 1153.759
lot of every emotion about energy being

1148.509 --> 1155.429
unleashed on to it hmm have you ever

1153.759 --> 1158.2
felt locked into it

1155.429 --> 1161.999
yeah then in the dark world experiences

1158.2 --> 1167.169
that's exactly what that feels like yes

1161.999 --> 1169.3500000000001
but what does that like no I bet you

1167.169 --> 1169.3500000000001
don't

1172.059 --> 1178.389
well no I don't have dark world okay

1175.769 --> 1182.2
well what what is it like when you're

1178.389 --> 1185.019
locked into a dark world experience well

1182.2 --> 1188.529
like you're in a dream you have all your

1185.019 --> 1191.08
senses to you but yeah some factors

1188.529 --> 1193.96
about your ability maybe missing it's

1191.08 --> 1196.359
very hard to get used to and you can't

1193.96 --> 1200.1390000000001
escape so it's like a nightmare you know

1196.359 --> 1201.9399999999998
it can be a nightmare but it's not just

1200.139 --> 1205.6
like a nightmare because regular

1201.94 --> 1208.45
nightmares are usually more just the

1205.6 --> 1211.059
feeling and then the dream reflects upon

1208.45 --> 1213.22
the feeling that's usually how normal

1211.059 --> 1216.489
nightmares arrive but in the dark world

1213.22 --> 1219.789
experience it's really about what you

1216.489 --> 1221.8890000000001
are and what you're doing but it's like

1219.789 --> 1228.19
you're being locked into a dream in a

1221.889 --> 1233.4889999999998
way I don't know yeah that's it's very

1228.19 --> 1233.489
rough outlay of what it's like because

1235.86 --> 1241.27
I've never had those kinds of

1238.3 --> 1244.87
experiences before you no more at all

1241.27 --> 1248.32
I've never had that okay well maybe you

1244.87 --> 1252.6699999999998
don't have the natural capabilities of

1248.32 --> 1257.29
it I probably do it's it's tied into the

1252.67 --> 1259.8400000000001
pineal gland and I think I've had some

1257.29 --> 1263.8
of those experiences naturally when I

1259.84 --> 1266.9499999999998
was younger and so yeah people are known

1263.8 --> 1270.8799999999999
to have that exist and some people can't

1266.95 --> 1273.8500000000001
have those experiences naturally and

1270.88 --> 1277.8400000000001
it's so very intense very intense very

1273.85 --> 1280.83
frightening nightmares no no no you that

1277.84 --> 1285.73
fright I didn't insert the nightmares

1280.83 --> 1291.4299999999998
the nightmare it can be a nightmare all

1285.73 --> 1293.59
depends on what you have with you what

1291.43 --> 1299.6200000000001
your feet what you're like I don't get

1293.59 --> 1301.4499999999998
that I honestly I don't quite understand

1299.62 --> 1304.12
what when you say what you have with you

1301.45 --> 1306.91
in Y when you're asleep you are your

1304.12 --> 1311.11
identity your soul what you feel like

1306.91 --> 1317.53
what concerns you all that the core of

1311.11 --> 1322.36
what you are okay so you have things

1317.53 --> 1325.75
that you're anxious about in real life

1322.36 --> 1328.54
that are bothering you at night in your

1325.75 --> 1330.13
dream so bad that you have night - I

1328.54 --> 1335.71
think so people have call them night

1330.13 --> 1337.72
terrors right night terrors but night

1335.71 --> 1339.6100000000001
terrors are just pretty expected we're

1337.72 --> 1342.13
like nervous and yeah but those are

1339.61 --> 1345.1299999999999
literal nightmare experiences that turn

1342.13 --> 1349.1200000000001
pretty extreme that's different

1345.13 --> 1351.3100000000002
I wasn't being assaulted it's not like

1349.12 --> 1353.6799999999998
in the dreams were like oh my god a deep

1351.31 --> 1355.96
pile of demons are piling on me and

1353.68 --> 1360.54
ripping me but no that's not what that

1355.96 --> 1364.06
experience is like although I've had

1360.54 --> 1367.09
like those types of things unleashed on

1364.06 --> 1367.72
me as part of the dark world experience

1367.09 --> 1369.6999999999998
but it was

1367.72 --> 1370.929
clearly being subjected to me by another

1369.7 --> 1376.409
entity

1370.929 --> 1376.409
I would like force me to undergo that

1376.769 --> 1380.83
well that sounds terrifying

1378.879 --> 1383.4699999999998
yeah that is freaking terrifying

1380.83 --> 1385.269
absolutely but that's not the D sure

1383.47 --> 1387.34
that spirits the interactions with the

1385.269 --> 1393.759
other entities and I don't recommend it

1387.34 --> 1396.1
don't be a fool no I'm not I've never

1393.759 --> 1398.59
had those experiences so so I wouldn't

1396.1 --> 1401.889
know but it seems like really

1398.59 --> 1404.5
frightening dreams that you're having

1401.889 --> 1410.379
that you have no I don't I don't have

1404.5 --> 1413.32
they very frequent no no so they're not

1410.379 --> 1418.62
very frequented they've diminished as

1413.32 --> 1420.7
you've gotten older it's not like that I

1418.62 --> 1425.9799999999998
guess I don't understand

1420.7 --> 1428.95
indeed well I'm I'm trying

1425.98 --> 1430.57
Arwen I'm trying I'm trying to

1428.95 --> 1433.0900000000001
understand what are you trying to

1430.57 --> 1434.6789999999999
profile me for your psychological report

1433.09 --> 1438.9089999999999
of all the flat earthers is that what

1434.679 --> 1440.5900000000001
you're trying to do I don't make any

1438.909 --> 1443.3090000000002
reports to anybody Arwen

1440.59 --> 1447.1589999999999
I've seen you naturally write it down

1443.309 --> 1451.6
before you you even bragged about it at

1447.159 --> 1453.7
some point write write write things down

1451.6 --> 1456.2199999999998
I don't know what you're I'd never

1453.7 --> 1458.47
written anything down I don't know what

1456.22 --> 1460.48
you mean well you probably forgot it was

1458.47 --> 1464.919
probably a bluff it's just one of those

1460.48 --> 1467.23
things that I don't know you've never

1464.919 --> 1469.99
seen me so how could you have seen me

1467.23 --> 1472.419
write something down well let's just say

1469.99 --> 1477.3990000000001
I remember you saying that you were

1472.419 --> 1481.1200000000001
writing it down but yeah it's been I

1477.399 --> 1483.9699999999998
don't really just say that look the

1481.12 --> 1484.6589999999999
thing is I'm a little suspicious not a

1483.97 --> 1486.759
big deal

1484.659 --> 1490.96
the issue is I'm a little suspicious of

1486.759 --> 1492.789
you because of the past because of what

1490.96 --> 1495.97
I've learned about you that's the past

1492.789 --> 1498.129
yeah yeah Brenda you you might not

1495.97 --> 1501.6100000000001
remember but I've known you for over a

1498.129 --> 1506.53
year I probably know you a lot

1501.61 --> 1510.1
but even some of my neighbors okay so

1506.53 --> 1515.92
what that might be well I can tell you I

1510.1 --> 1518.98
live in a very small apartment I live on

1515.92 --> 1525.22
assistance in the United States which

1518.98 --> 1529.54
isn't much right so I'm not an agent of

1525.22 --> 1532.03
any kind nobody in the globe air side

1529.54 --> 1534.79
here is an agent because the United

1532.03 --> 1537.52
States doesn't care doesn't give a damn

1534.79 --> 1546.75
about Flat Earth it's not important to

1537.52 --> 1551.95
anybody okay sure yeah it's very nice so

1546.75 --> 1553.69
anything else well I'm curious about

1551.95 --> 1558.3400000000001
these nightmares that you have that are

1553.69 --> 1559.809
very intense and very frightening now I

1558.34 --> 1562.57
don't know why you keep on emphasizing

1559.809 --> 1566.32
very intense and very frightening when

1562.57 --> 1568.36
they're not they're not pregnant

1566.32 --> 1571.21
no I just told you the default

1568.36 --> 1574.59
experience is not like that at all it's

1571.21 --> 1577.77
only when you're being manipulated with

1574.59 --> 1582.34
inside the experience by another force

1577.77 --> 1584.95
if you get fooled if you for example

1582.34 --> 1587.559
stick to it too look one of my biggest

1584.95 --> 1589.54
mistakes concerning the entire visions

1587.559 --> 1593.309
and all that [ __ ] especially when I was

1589.54 --> 1596.5
younger and it's a natural mistake is

1593.309 --> 1599.049
because it arrived basically silently

1596.5 --> 1602.23
nobody knew I was undergoing that when I

1599.049 --> 1604.809
was very young I kept it to myself it

1602.23 --> 1607.3600000000001
was very bizarre so this really was like

1604.809 --> 1609.61
an RKO these were real reflection to me

1607.36 --> 1614.8899999999999
oh can I please finish my explanation

1609.61 --> 1620.5
right so because of that at points I

1614.89 --> 1622.8400000000001
developed a hunger to know more to make

1620.5 --> 1625.86
it more real to me as it were and I

1622.84 --> 1628.809
would literally instead of just

1625.86 --> 1630.6689999999999
accidentally getting trapped in that and

1628.809 --> 1632.8
just by being in some kind of

1630.669 --> 1634.69
holographic representation of my direct

1632.8 --> 1636.509
surroundings with buildings and all that

1634.69 --> 1640.179
and I would do these silly things like

1636.509 --> 1642.19
walking on the buildings on the rooftops

1640.179 --> 1644.2
this year that's one of the I was very

1642.19 --> 1646.479
small when I did that but it was just

1644.2 --> 1647.349
fun and I could do that in a dark world

1646.479 --> 1649.539
that's frightening

1647.349 --> 1653.4089999999999
no it's not frightening it was very cool

1649.539 --> 1656.44
to do what it was a gentle kid to be

1653.409 --> 1657.5800000000002
walking you know no I wasn't live you're

1656.44 --> 1659.769
not listening

1657.58 --> 1662.349
you're not listening it was inside a

1659.769 --> 1665.559
holographic representation of the

1662.349 --> 1669.099
neighborhood it wasn't real it was a

1665.559 --> 1671.83
reflection of the world that I made with

1669.099 --> 1674.95
that dark world because it is already in

1671.83 --> 1677.6789999999999
your mind all right it's like a holodeck

1674.95 --> 1680.8590000000002
you know so this would happen that they

1677.679 --> 1682.539
had happened while you were awake no it

1680.859 --> 1687.6999999999998
would have an ALICE while you are awake

1682.539 --> 1690.269
no I well I was asleep also these things

1687.7 --> 1700.45
only happened while you were asleep I

1690.269 --> 1703.45
think so yes okay right so so the point

1700.45 --> 1705.8790000000001
raised if I can at least continue my

1703.45 --> 1708.1290000000001
train of thought concerning this point

1705.879 --> 1711.7289999999998
is is that because it arrived in secret

1708.129 --> 1716.9989999999998
I wanted to explore more and basically

1711.729 --> 1720.07
dig deeper in within that state just

1716.999 --> 1722.95
figure out what's going on like really

1720.07 --> 1724.869
getting serious about the experience but

1722.95 --> 1729.909
because I did that that somehow

1724.869 --> 1734.129
attracted entities that attract that got

1729.909 --> 1737.979
them involved and meddling with my life

1734.129 --> 1743.049
because I just so that sounds because I

1737.979 --> 1746.259
wasn't warned about it you know it

1743.049 --> 1746.979
sounds pretty scary that that time was

1746.259 --> 1749.619
scary

1746.979 --> 1753.509
that's like in the in my team times

1749.619 --> 1753.509
that's when things got really weird

1755.91 --> 1762.809
and that would be for for a young kid

1759.809 --> 1766.6499999999999
that would be very confusing very

1762.809 --> 1768.03
frightening right no disorienting no

1766.65 --> 1769.8600000000001
right no it wouldn't

1768.03 --> 1772.1689999999999
sounds like a no it wouldn't be it

1769.86 --> 1773.8799999999999
wouldn't yeah but that's you because you

1772.169 --> 1775.71
don't know do you understand

1773.88 --> 1777.5390000000002
[ __ ] about what I'm talking about and

1775.71 --> 1779.13
they're constantly associating

1777.539 --> 1782.22
nightmares with everything I'm

1779.13 --> 1786.5700000000002
explaining for some reason is your

1782.22 --> 1790.08
projection it's not because of cause I'm

1786.57 --> 1793.6789999999999
not done yet because especially when I

1790.08 --> 1796.98
was young I lent a lot of strength from

1793.679 --> 1800.76
the experience as well

1796.98 --> 1803.039
it just was another depth to it all so I

1800.76 --> 1806.34
learned a lot of strength from that and

1803.039 --> 1810.48
that also that same strength helped me

1806.34 --> 1813.9289999999999
to face the weird entities with my own

1810.48 --> 1814.98
personal moral insight but I wasn't

1813.929 --> 1817.47
perfect yet

1814.98 --> 1822.63
and I was raised by people yeah by

1817.47 --> 1824.909
parents that had mistakes and I didn't

1822.63 --> 1829.5900000000001
see that I was young and that really

1824.909 --> 1831.95
caused the whole thing to become yeah

1829.59 --> 1835.3999999999999
less pleasant to me and that's why it

1831.95 --> 1839.45
actively stepped away like okay this

1835.4 --> 1842.5800000000002
this is not going anywhere

1839.45 --> 1846.0800000000002
interacting with all of that actively I

1842.58 --> 1849.36
just reflect upon it now that's all I do

1846.08 --> 1854.85
don't engage anymore not going back to

1849.36 --> 1859.02
okay right so no I'm done okay right so

1854.85 --> 1860.25
you you had these experiences then you

1859.02 --> 1863.37
don't want to call them dreams it will

1860.25 --> 1865.2
call them experiences and which you felt

1863.37 --> 1870.809
that you are being attacked by entities

1865.2 --> 1873.51
and you tried to down the it's not

1870.809 --> 1876.84
attacked it's it's not so not attacked

1873.51 --> 1878.94
no it's not a freaking computer game

1876.84 --> 1880.86
it's not a computer game where you just

1878.94 --> 1884.51
enter around when you get attacked by

1880.86 --> 1889.29
beasts okay these entities are not

1884.51 --> 1893.91
static monsters their intelligence

1889.29 --> 1896.01
based things that they get things done

1893.91 --> 1899.7
through their interaction and fooling

1896.01 --> 1903.18
you and all that they don't just attack

1899.7 --> 1906.3
you they attack you with dreams that's

1903.18 --> 1914.76
what they do they try to plant ideas on

1906.3 --> 1924.18
you what kind of ideas well you know I

1914.76 --> 1930.39
just love understand I'd like to go I'm

1924.18 --> 1933.8100000000002
just trying to understand Darwin so they

1930.39 --> 1939.99
took they try to implant ideas in you

1933.81 --> 1942.2
yeah by sharing them in that experience

1939.99 --> 1945.15
I've said glow

1942.2 --> 1948.63
besides the globe well maybe they're

1945.15 --> 1951.66
trying to tell you they were telling me

1948.63 --> 1953.7900000000002
maybe their journey they were look if I

1951.66 --> 1956.3100000000002
may explain they were telling me all

1953.79 --> 1959.67
just pursue they were very mimicking of

1956.31 --> 1961.59
what human culture does and trying to

1959.67 --> 1962.91
basically tell it like Oh what are you

1961.59 --> 1966.99
dreams what do you want

1962.91 --> 1972.3300000000002
and then basically show you a glorified

1966.99 --> 1975.15
version leaving out the ugliness then

1972.33 --> 1980.28
you fall in love with that and then they

1975.15 --> 1982.89
try to basically yeah let you be

1980.28 --> 1985.11
corrupted by the things they didn't tell

1982.89 --> 1990.47
you about it or didn't share with in the

1985.11 --> 1996.24
experience it's just it's very

1990.47 --> 1998.3600000000001
complicated I understand and I am trying

1996.24 --> 2002.06
to understand it more

1998.36 --> 2008.4499999999998
so these experiences weren't entirely

2002.06 --> 2011.4199999999998
unpleasant then well seduction is there

2008.45 --> 2014.3600000000001
are seductions in there as well yeah so

2011.42 --> 2017.63
that you could as a temporary thing see

2014.36 --> 2017.87
that as Pleasant but it it doesn't add

2017.63 --> 2021.41
up

2017.87 --> 2026.1799999999998
as as such eventually

2021.41 --> 2029.8400000000001
there yeah what no everything has some

2026.18 --> 2038.98
kind of consequence there whatever

2029.84 --> 2038.98
interaction is done okay

2039.43 --> 2045.55
it sounds very um very exhausting

2046.99 --> 2056.23
exhausting yeah how that's what it

2054.11 --> 2059.4190000000003
sounds like

2056.23 --> 2062.72
it's time very any cousin seems to take

2059.419 --> 2065.48
a lot of energy well they do they try

2062.72 --> 2069.1389999999997
but look time is kind of like

2065.48 --> 2074.03
meaningless there in a way it's pretty

2069.139 --> 2077.27
malleable so it doesn't okay it's more

2074.03 --> 2081.11
like you just have an entry amount of

2077.27 --> 2084.62
energy and that's what you got and you

2081.11 --> 2088.7200000000003
can take as long as you can with it but

2084.62 --> 2093.47
eventually you will run out or you'll

2088.72 --> 2100.2799999999997
manage to like figure out the key into

2093.47 --> 2103.0699999999997
stepping out of the experience well that

2100.28 --> 2104.8700000000003
would be kind of scary to me if I was in

2103.07 --> 2106.28
an experience if I was in an experience

2104.87 --> 2111.44
that I couldn't get out of that would be

2106.28 --> 2114.05
very frightening for me well that is

2111.44 --> 2117.19
because you're trying to imagine it

2114.05 --> 2120.0800000000004
based on the perspective of being

2117.19 --> 2122.66
confronted with similar situations that

2120.08 --> 2125.5099999999998
you have experienced and I'm

2122.66 --> 2127.49
guaranteeing you that if you if you

2125.51 --> 2131.9900000000002
would ever undergo that experience it's

2127.49 --> 2138.2299999999996
not like yourself normally it's it's

2131.99 --> 2141.16
just different yeah the only kind of odd

2138.23 --> 2147.47
experiences I've ever had in dreams are

2141.16 --> 2149.6299999999997
things like flying being invisible those

2147.47 --> 2151.3999999999996
are a couple experiences I've had I've

2149.63 --> 2153.11
never had any of these other experiences

2151.4 --> 2156.89
oh yeah

2153.11 --> 2160.9100000000003
well in in in regular dreams or yeah

2156.89 --> 2163.49
that's it's not directly dark now in the

2160.91 --> 2166.2799999999997
dark role I don't have like those dream

2163.49 --> 2169.31
powers like that but I have had

2166.28 --> 2173.8
extensive well I've used dreams even

2169.31 --> 2176.2999999999997
actively as like exploring ground as to

2173.8 --> 2179.42
perfecting flight and levitation

2176.3 --> 2182.09
repulsion skills all that it's weird

2179.42 --> 2183.83
like in my mind I know exactly how to do

2182.09 --> 2185.81
these things if I would ever arrive in

2183.83 --> 2187.58
the dream situation it's just like I had

2185.81 --> 2191.36
a piece of technology that was part of

2187.58 --> 2194.18
my body because I trained it so much oh

2191.36 --> 2196.67
but that's just regular so that's just a

2194.18 --> 2199.19
regular dream that's not part of the

2196.67 --> 2201.4700000000003
dark well maybe one I've imagined that

2199.19 --> 2203.75
one day I would be able to utilize my

2201.47 --> 2208.0699999999997
dream world skills in the dark world but

2203.75 --> 2212.03
I just not something I really pursue at

2208.07 --> 2213.46
this for it thanks to a life experience

2212.03 --> 2216.17
and wisdom

2213.46 --> 2223.07
well Widow apparently give you control

2216.17 --> 2225.6800000000003
over the dark world experiences no I'm

2223.07 --> 2229.94
just guessing because I haven't had

2225.68 --> 2232.58
these okay I understand I'm trying to

2229.94 --> 2233.12
understand and as you can you know I'm

2232.58 --> 2235.97
trying

2233.12 --> 2239.33
Arwen yeah but it's useless really it's

2235.97 --> 2243.35
really useless to to try to understand

2239.33 --> 2247.19
it if you can't even get the frequency

2243.35 --> 2250.0099999999998
right of of what I'm trying to explain

2247.19 --> 2252.44
you're just stepping beside the point so

2250.01 --> 2254.4500000000003
it's no use trying to get it because

2252.44 --> 2258.52
it's not even close to what you're

2254.45 --> 2261.91
probably thinking despite my elaborate

2258.52 --> 2261.91
explanations and

2263.13 --> 2270.6400000000003
but really is it something you're

2266.44 --> 2274.839
missing okay you do have dreams right

2270.64 --> 2278.3799999999997
I'm just wrinkly sometimes sometimes I

2274.839 --> 2282.089
don't have very many dreams and my

2278.38 --> 2284.6800000000003
dreams are pretty ordinary right I just

2282.089 --> 2287.229
have dreams about ordinary things that

2284.68 --> 2294.749
have happened during the day things like

2287.229 --> 2298.749
that I don't have these in I don't have

2294.749 --> 2302.2
dreams where I have sort of powers or

2298.749 --> 2304.229
anything very often it was a long time

2302.2 --> 2314.229
ago not recently

2304.229 --> 2318.999
hmm and I've had bizarre dreams but not

2314.229 --> 2320.709
not not terribly often right and I don't

2318.999 --> 2326.819
think I've ever had a nightmare in my

2320.709 --> 2329.8289999999997
life ever really yeah

2326.819 --> 2333.0389999999998
are you sure or did you just forget the

2329.829 --> 2336.3390000000004
experience because you seem to be

2333.039 --> 2338.529
thinking about nightmares when you were

2336.339 --> 2341.529
trying to visualize what I was talking

2338.529 --> 2342.849
about very vividly so that's weird if

2341.529 --> 2347.739
you're saying now that you never

2342.849 --> 2351.63
experienced the nightmare ever then how

2347.739 --> 2351.63
would you even know how to refer to it

2352.769 --> 2358.749
well I know what people talk about and

2355.359 --> 2362.529
how they talk about those kinds of

2358.749 --> 2364.509
experiences and things maybe I have

2362.529 --> 2370.93
forgotten because they were so very long

2364.509 --> 2373.15
ago that's possible right maybe maybe

2370.93 --> 2377.499
when I can remember being really little

2373.15 --> 2381.88
and not being quite awake and not being

2377.499 --> 2385.269
quite asleep and being scared of like

2381.88 --> 2387.969
maybe a coat or a blanket or draped over

2385.269 --> 2389.859
a chair thinking it was a monster but I

2387.969 --> 2391.599
was really young back then I wasn't I

2389.859 --> 2394.479
wasn't even in high school it was before

2391.599 --> 2396.8700000000003
high school okay okay fine so you did

2394.479 --> 2399.3999999999996
have nightmares yeah but I haven't

2396.87 --> 2402.22
no I don't know if that was really a

2399.4 --> 2403.7200000000003
nightmare but oh now yeah what yeah what

2402.22 --> 2406.06
is this

2403.72 --> 2409.06
stop being so neurotic I wouldn't call

2406.06 --> 2413.35
that I wouldn't call that a nightmare

2409.06 --> 2415.12
really weird thing just a weird thing

2413.35 --> 2417.49
did you have a very bad experience

2415.12 --> 2420.1
something kids owing it did do you

2417.49 --> 2426.04
remember being all sweaty when you woke

2420.1 --> 2429.1
up no oh no I don't remember that

2426.04 --> 2432.19
happening at all okay

2429.1 --> 2435.67
no I don't think I've ever I don't think

2432.19 --> 2438.52
I've ever woken up with night sweats no

2435.67 --> 2442.42
but that would be pretty frightening to

2438.52 --> 2444.97
have a an experience when you're

2442.42 --> 2448.66
sleeping that was so terrifying you woke

2444.97 --> 2450.99
up in sweats that would be very scary no

2448.66 --> 2455.3399999999997
it just has to be startling enough

2450.99 --> 2455.3399999999997
doesn't have to be very scary at all

2456.42 --> 2463.71
well I would put startling in the same

2459.67 --> 2471.07
sort of general category as frightening

2463.71 --> 2473.7400000000002
exactly so the thing is okay nightmare

2471.07 --> 2476.8900000000003
can be frightening and terrifying and

2473.74 --> 2479.14
horrible that doesn't do anything on its

2476.89 --> 2481.24
own it's what really makes you wake up

2479.14 --> 2486.58
from a nightmare is being startled

2481.24 --> 2488.14
shocked that's just how it works anyway

2486.58 --> 2493.14
by the way I want to shout out some

2488.14 --> 2496.5699999999997
people here what yeah go ahead

2493.14 --> 2498.31
yeah thank you a man a young for the $5

2496.57 --> 2500.8900000000003
ship chatter nation or when do you think

2498.31 --> 2505.0299999999997
dreams have meaning to them yes they do

2500.89 --> 2507.0099999999998
and Julia Pavan for the five-dollar

2505.03 --> 2508.86
super cheddar nation and Brenda have you

2507.01 --> 2514.63
ever dreamed about the earth being flat

2508.86 --> 2517.7200000000003
please be honest I have never dreamt

2514.63 --> 2520.27
about the earth being flat and I don't

2517.72 --> 2523.7799999999997
think that dreams have any meaning

2520.27 --> 2526.57
they're just they're just dreams they

2523.78 --> 2529.5
don't have any deep philosophical or

2526.57 --> 2529.5
spiritual meaning

2529.98 --> 2538.54
okay that's what I think fair enough

2535.6 --> 2542.109
they're just dreams yeah even the

2538.54 --> 2544.18
frightening ones it's not real it's just

2542.109 --> 2548.41
something that's happening in your head

2544.18 --> 2549.359
for various reasons and even if you're

2548.41 --> 2551.47
frightened

2549.359 --> 2556.39
you can comfort yourself by

2551.47 --> 2559.72
understanding that is not real right I

2556.39 --> 2563.0499999999997
get that but does that make it not real

2559.72 --> 2565.39
though in itself

2563.05 --> 2567.9700000000003
welcome trick applies to everything if

2565.39 --> 2570.22
you just disbelief then you cut yourself

2567.97 --> 2572.859
off from it and you can try to find

2570.22 --> 2576.5499999999997
tranquility in opposing it does it make

2572.859 --> 2583.99
it real like it doesn't make it not real

2576.55 --> 2587.0800000000004
though I think that because there aren't

2583.99 --> 2591.49
any consequences for dreams that they

2587.08 --> 2595.09
aren't real so the fact that if I fall

2591.49 --> 2597.58
down and break my leg in a dream and

2595.09 --> 2602.26
then I wake up my leg is not broken that

2597.58 --> 2604.48
means that dreams aren't real well it

2602.26 --> 2611.1400000000003
could mean that that experience is not

2604.48 --> 2613.27
real yeah you don't know exactly because

2611.14 --> 2615.25
maybe you might catch up on that

2613.27 --> 2617.08
experience at some point later and it'll

2615.25 --> 2622.99
may actually manifest exactly as you

2617.08 --> 2625.96
dream you don't know well I've never had

2622.99 --> 2627.8199999999997
that happened okay or you just remember

2625.96 --> 2630.07
it because people tend to forget all

2627.82 --> 2636.31
their dreams usually right after they

2630.07 --> 2641.98
had them yeah yeah that's fairly common

2636.31 --> 2644.41
for people exactly right so the fact

2641.98 --> 2647.8
that if I die in a dream I don't

2644.41 --> 2653.18
actually die I think that that's a good

2647.8 --> 2656.2200000000003
indication that dreams aren't real right

2653.18 --> 2663.45
well it seemed to me in a way that or if

2656.22 --> 2665.2799999999997
I break what huh sorry you were saying I

2663.45 --> 2669.0899999999997
was gonna say if I break my legs in it

2665.28 --> 2672.03
if I break my legs in a dream right and

2669.09 --> 2675.48
when I wake up my legs aren't broken or

2672.03 --> 2677.61
if I'm in a different City when I'm

2675.48 --> 2681.21
dreaming I still wake up at in my bed

2677.61 --> 2683.55
that's so that's not real so I don't

2681.21 --> 2685.77
think the dreams are real they're just

2683.55 --> 2688.8300000000004
dreams they don't mean anything

2685.77 --> 2692.5099999999998
right well that's from that perspective

2688.83 --> 2695.91
from the time linear based direct

2692.51 --> 2699.15
material perspective but again if you

2695.91 --> 2704.27
don't have a wider understanding of how

2699.15 --> 2707.2400000000002
dreams can bypass time at certain

2704.27 --> 2711.66
situations and just show you things like

2707.24 --> 2713.97
I've I've been doing that sort of that's

2711.66 --> 2718.41
had that had my interest a lot

2713.97 --> 2720.48
throughout my life and yeah if I don't

2718.41 --> 2722.6099999999997
have that then you don't there's nothing

2720.48 --> 2724.65
else I could do about it

2722.61 --> 2727.38
and if that causes you to believe that

2724.65 --> 2729.33
it is just all fake yeah so be it

2727.38 --> 2732.96
technically there's something important

2729.33 --> 2737.2799999999997
to it because again as I said I've had

2732.96 --> 2740.31
some really messed up visions unleashed

2737.28 --> 2743.13
upon me and some of those they got

2740.31 --> 2747.09
really close to me and I have trouble

2743.13 --> 2749.1600000000003
basically undoing them because they keep

2747.09 --> 2753.23
popping back into my head as if it were

2749.16 --> 2755.7
real well that's there's just no chance

2753.23 --> 2759.3
that kind of thing so you're bothered by

2755.7 --> 2762.06
some of these you're bothered by some of

2759.3 --> 2767.4900000000002
these eggs dark world experiences right

2762.06 --> 2775.13
yes are there any you'd be willing to

2767.49 --> 2780.24
share well not the specific situation no

2775.13 --> 2781.9700000000003
but I think okay shared so many things

2780.24 --> 2784.74
no pressure

2781.97 --> 2786.6699999999996
yeah yeah it's not like you're going to

2784.74 --> 2789.43
be able to pressure

2786.67 --> 2793.81
me to give out anything more than I want

2789.43 --> 2798.6
to so I wouldn't I wouldn't do that

2793.81 --> 2798.6
Arwen I wouldn't do that

2799.59 --> 2805.3
yeah so if you don't want to I wouldn't

2802.39 --> 2812.7999999999997
try to pressure you to I wouldn't do

2805.3 --> 2815.17
that okay good for you right so this is

2812.8 --> 2819.46
this is a non-confrontational thing

2815.17 --> 2823.75
right so I didn't come in here looking

2819.46 --> 2825.94
to have an argument or looking to make

2823.75 --> 2827.44
people up or to get half yelling and

2825.94 --> 2829.2400000000002
shouting that's not what I was looking

2827.44 --> 2830.8
for no you were digging and you're

2829.24 --> 2834.04
digging in my dreams

2830.8 --> 2837.25
no I'm just trying to so I'm just trying

2834.04 --> 2840.91
to ask questions and I understand where

2837.25 --> 2846.16
you're coming from that's all there's

2840.91 --> 2850.24
nothing more than that okay that's just

2846.16 --> 2862.6
okay yeah okay so is there any other

2850.24 --> 2865.4199999999996
point you'd like to bring up perhaps are

2862.6 --> 2868.14
you done for to do you think we've I

2865.42 --> 2870.55
think we've probably gone enough right

2868.14 --> 2873.97
right I agree

2870.55 --> 2876.55
okay well anyway thanks for coming out

2873.97 --> 2887.2599999999998
Brenda oh yeah see you around

2876.55 --> 2890.67
yes all right thank you right okay yeah

2887.26 --> 2890.67
50 more minutes

2894.49 --> 2901.58
yeah Cleary I know I'm look I'm not a

2900.95 --> 2910.1299999999997
fool

2901.58 --> 2912.56
okay I've whatever I've said about my

2910.13 --> 2921.1
visions that is it is just what it is

2912.56 --> 2923.72
and I'm not a fool it's just a unique

2921.1 --> 2928.58
experience that's part of my life

2923.72 --> 2930.77
specifically and I can talk about it try

2928.58 --> 2932.5699999999997
to explain and yeah that's just a lot of

2930.77 --> 2937.25
people that's jarett that are just not

2932.57 --> 2941.15
gonna get it they're not because I have

2937.25 --> 2944.63
trouble I've had trouble getting it

2941.15 --> 2951.65
really even identifying it in the first

2944.63 --> 2955.1
place was weird talk sometime I think

2951.65 --> 2958.9700000000003
that the first time ever that I even

2955.1 --> 2963.23
talked to anybody else about that type

2958.97 --> 2965.2099999999996
of experience because I was just worried

2963.23 --> 2973.01
and haunted by some of the things in

2965.21 --> 2975.46
them was when I was think to anyone so

2973.01 --> 2975.46
bizarre

2976.869 --> 2984.369
and before that I've had probably a lot

2981.339 --> 2989.019
of these types of experiences and I can

2984.369 --> 2993.19
account for some of them but yeah I just

2989.019 --> 2995.89
never thought that it was like that I

2993.19 --> 3001.44
was supposed to share that with the

2995.89 --> 3003.15
outside world in any way that's and I

3001.44 --> 3006.63
think there were even an entity's trying

3003.15 --> 3008.279
to convince me that I shouldn't and then

3006.63 --> 3010.489
when I did do it they were really pissed

3008.279 --> 3010.489
off

3017.95 --> 3022.4199999999996
what are you talking about oh snap

3026.39 --> 3037.16
I wasn't very sociable I've been

3034.039 --> 3040.15
extremely nice what what is going on

3037.16 --> 3040.1499999999996
here this ridiculous

3054.45 --> 3062.8199999999997
very defensive what really Kate can you

3060.3 --> 3065.48
point at what exactly before i ban you

3062.82 --> 3071.46
oh snap

3065.48 --> 3073.88
let's see 10 seconds let's make it a

3071.46 --> 3073.88
good one

3076.32 --> 3079.9700000000003
oh yes sounds a bit low

3085.06 --> 3093.48
now a nice car

3108.63 --> 3116.07
mm-hmm yeah half of yeah that that's

3112.89 --> 3120.93
nice oh snap so half of what I talked

3116.07 --> 3123.6000000000004
about with Brenda was paranoid why

3120.93 --> 3127.3199999999997
exactly was it paranoid where did the

3123.6 --> 3130.14
fear and like where did that come in

3127.32 --> 3133.5
exactly where where did I mention that I

3130.14 --> 3135.75
remember Brenda inserting that a lot

3133.5 --> 3142.29
into the conversation suggesting that

3135.75 --> 3144.84
must be very frightening or terrible so

3142.29 --> 3152.31
is that what you're trying to do is this

3144.84 --> 3155.3
just another you have to grab him I have

3152.31 --> 3171.42
to make it look bad is it dangerous

3155.3 --> 3172.34
scary bad scary so scared yeah you miss

3171.42 --> 3176.76
it can be

3172.34 --> 3176.76
[Music]

3182.9 --> 3186.079
[Music]

3187.21 --> 3195.7
yeah let's see if I can get all righty

3192.92 --> 3195.7000000000003
did it again

3198.86 --> 3208.52
I was this yeah follow him back to

3202.01 --> 3210.9500000000003
normal yeah every time I allow somebody

3208.52 --> 3218.6
on skype like it really screws with the

3210.95 --> 3219.7999999999997
volumes don't know why does that why is

3218.6 --> 3223.1
it called dark world

3219.8 --> 3225.59
it's just arbitrary I called it the dark

3223.1 --> 3228.56
world because for me it was the first

3225.59 --> 3232.46
identifier to even recognize that it was

3228.56 --> 3236.63
something other than reality and that is

3232.46 --> 3240.07
that I've never seen the Stars or the

3236.63 --> 3248.29
Sun or the moon while in that experience

3240.07 --> 3248.29
the skies were always dark let's

3255.57 --> 3265.8
the name came up in the middle of trying

3258.48 --> 3267.12
to identify it for me because that is

3265.8 --> 3269.28
where the Dark Crystal

3267.12 --> 3271.23
really the dark world now the Dark

3269.28 --> 3277.3500000000004
Crystal is not in the dark world

3271.23 --> 3279.62
no it's don't see what that has to do

3277.35 --> 3279.62
with it

3326.09 --> 3337.67
da [ __ ] just leave why why do you think

3329.09 --> 3341.75
that flatlander I mean in certain states

3337.67 --> 3345.44
of mind if you're like feeble or semi

3341.75 --> 3347.81
psychotic like where you're like really

3345.44 --> 3350.51
in your direct analysis of what's going

3347.81 --> 3353.7799999999997
on you have troubles yeah it sure Dean D

3350.51 --> 3361.19
could be dangerous but so could a lot of

3353.78 --> 3364.2200000000003
other things you know and I don't think

3361.19 --> 3367.42
it directly [ __ ] with people's minds in

3364.22 --> 3367.4199999999996
that side

3370.62 --> 3373.7599999999998
I don't see it

3375.8 --> 3382.88
and even then it's just like a the real

3379.91 --> 3385.52
D&D in the world and what it hold all

3382.88 --> 3391.1
the technicals about it it's just a

3385.52 --> 3393.71
playing board it's just a setting if if

3391.1 --> 3395.87
it's basically screws with people's

3393.71 --> 3400.25
minds it's gonna be because of the

3395.87 --> 3402.56
people utilizing it in a way that screws

3400.25 --> 3405.65
with people's minds now there I could go

3402.56 --> 3411.94
with you but the game itself doesn't do

3405.65 --> 3411.94
that it's just a platform basically

3422.22 --> 3427.89
yeah on this you can see yeah dream

3426.21 --> 3430.16
catchers never really worked for me

3427.89 --> 3430.16
either

3447.28 --> 3449.9700000000003
what

3453.35 --> 3462.5
why are you saying that Fyodor

3457.5 --> 3469.19
Dostoevsky I have a decent

3462.5 --> 3469.19
dissociative streak Wow

3473.03 --> 3475.8100000000004
what does

3480.95 --> 3484.7799999999997
what what does that even mean

3499.84 --> 3505.17
detachment from physical and emotional

3503.19 --> 3508.63
experiences

3505.17 --> 3520.15
really I might detached from the

3508.63 --> 3522.04
experience it seems I don't know I think

3520.15 --> 3524.4900000000002
it's actually quite the opposite really

3522.04 --> 3524.49
I

3529.349 --> 3535.369
I don't see why you say this is so

3532.41 --> 3535.3689999999997
dissociative

3542.38 --> 3550.3900000000003
like that DISA so speaking word is

3546.58 --> 3556.5699999999997
basically about detaching from an expert

3550.39 --> 3561.19
like ignoring things that take trying to

3556.57 --> 3564.3900000000003
take it away from your worldview as it

3561.19 --> 3572.98
were I don't do that where do I do that

3564.39 --> 3575.5899999999997
ever it's like one of the bizarre things

3572.98 --> 3581.08
about me is that I pretty much embrace

3575.59 --> 3585.6400000000003
all the things in a way and then I just

3581.08 --> 3588.75
delve in to it and try to yeah make some

3585.64 --> 3588.75
sense of it all

3616.31 --> 3621.0099999999998
yeah could be the ayats

3623.08 --> 3631.8199999999997
I've never it's like the idea again of

3629.5 --> 3634.19
helping other people out with their

3631.82 --> 3639.23
mental states dealing with their life

3634.19 --> 3644.03
that that's useful that's even like part

3639.23 --> 3647.32
of human function in the old days you go

3644.03 --> 3651.46
to the to Grandma usually or something

3647.32 --> 3655.8500000000004
figure out some weird psycho issue and

3651.46 --> 3657.44
abnormal behavior that's there what is

3655.85 --> 3659.63
the problem with that it's just that

3657.44 --> 3662.63
indeed the profession and the way it's

3659.63 --> 3666.98
been corporatized and tied in with the

3662.63 --> 3670.07
drug industry and these people are just

3666.98 --> 3673.52
kind of like forced or forced yeah I

3670.07 --> 3675.86
guess they are it's like there's no not

3673.52 --> 3678.62
a lot of other options if you want to

3675.86 --> 3681.76
get around then you have to either sell

3678.62 --> 3684.44
the drugs or keep a lot of loonies

3681.76 --> 3689.2000000000003
attached to you and make them keep on

3684.44 --> 3692.2400000000002
coming back that this it's a very sad

3689.2 --> 3697.72
circumstance to find yourself in in my

3692.24 --> 3703.4599999999996
personal opinion for me I'd rather just

3697.72 --> 3707.1499999999996
help out people with yeah so that they

3703.46 --> 3710.75
can move on with this a little damage

3707.15 --> 3716.36
and cost and everything as possible it

3710.75 --> 3719.42
seems much more effective to me yeah

3716.36 --> 3723.5
anyway I'm gonna round out this crazy

3719.42 --> 3726.89
crazy show me talking with Brenna about

3723.5 --> 3730.88
dark world visions she's like probably

3726.89 --> 3732.92
one the least the people that would get

3730.88 --> 3735.92
that the least or even the point of it

3732.92 --> 3738.83
or anything about it's just I don't know

3735.92 --> 3741.19
why I hope you guys got something from

3738.83 --> 3743.45
